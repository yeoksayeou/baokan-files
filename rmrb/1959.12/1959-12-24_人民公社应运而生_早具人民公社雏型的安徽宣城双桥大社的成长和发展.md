　　People's Communes Emerge
　　——The Growth and Development of Shuangqiao Great Society in Xuancheng, Anhui, an Early Prototype of People's Communes
    Investigation by the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, the Wuhu Prefectural Party Committee, and the Xuancheng County Party Committee Working Group
    Written by Zhang Lizhi and Wang Chuanqing
    In Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, there is a Shuangqiao Great Society, an early prototype of a people's commune. The Shuangqiao Great Society was formed in the spring of 1956 by merging eighty-eight agricultural cooperatives from eight townships, with a total of 5,071 households, and implemented the integration of government and commune. From that time on, it already possessed the prototype of a people's commune. Because no one could think of a more appropriate name, it was simply called the Shuangqiao Great Society. In September 1958, at the height of the communization movement, the Shuangqiao Great Society merged with fourteen surrounding agricultural cooperatives, growing to 14,207 households and officially becoming the Shuangqiao People's Commune.

    Some say that the people's communes were not tested and were "rushed into existence." The growth and development of the Shuangqiao Great Society powerfully proves that this argument is utterly absurd.

    The Great Society Was Created by the Masses Themselves

    The Shuangqiao Great Society is a plain area that is high in the south and low in the north, bordering Magu Mountain to the east and the Shuiyang River to the west. The water from the Tonggong Dam flows from southeast to northwest. Before liberation, the water conservancy infrastructure here was extremely poor. The low-lying areas had no embankments, and the high-lying areas had no ditches. It was either flooding or drought, and the farmers here lived a very miserable life. They called this place the "Shrimp Nest" and "Sky-Gazing Poverty." After liberation, especially after the establishment of cooperatives, many water conservancy projects were built, which improved agricultural production and the lives of the members. However, because the cooperatives were small and weak, they could neither concentrate greater strength to build large-scale projects nor make overall plans. They could only engage in piecemeal, small-scale repairs. Therefore, drought and flood disasters could not be eradicated. There was a low-lying area of 25,000 mu here. From 1949 to 1955, there were floods in four years and droughts in two years. The masses described the area as "heavy rains for three days, large boats everywhere" and "exposed to the sun for ten days, the ground smokes from dryness." At that time, the agricultural cooperatives here had studied the matter several times, intending to build embankments and dig ditches here to eradicate drought and flood disasters. However, there were some difficult-to-resolve contradictions between the cooperatives. Building embankments and digging ditches required destroying 400 mu of land and 370,000 workdays. The cooperatives that benefited more and destroyed less land were willing to do it, while the cooperatives that benefited less and destroyed more land were unwilling to do it. The cooperatives with more land had to contribute 300 workdays per laborer, which would take a whole year to complete, and they had no confidence in completing the task. The cooperatives with less land only had to contribute 40-50 workdays per laborer, but they were afraid of losing out by doing more work. In the winter of 1954, thirteen small cooperatives, including Tushan, Lianhe, and Damagang, discussed the matter many times and dispatched more than 600 laborers to build a small embankment of 9,000 mu. Because these contradictions were not resolved, they dispersed after only five days of work. This fact profoundly educated the local masses. They said, "To build embankments and dig ditches, small cooperatives must merge into large cooperatives."

    In the autumn of 1955, after Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation were conveyed here, the broad masses of people improved their awareness and liberated their thinking through study. Those who had already joined the cooperatives demanded that the cooperatives be expanded, and those who had not yet joined the cooperatives scrambled to join. At that time, the Xuancheng County Party Committee, in response to the demands of the masses here, proposed taking the merging of cooperatives as the center, combined with expanding the cooperatives, and emphasized that in planning the scale of the cooperatives, it must proceed from the benefit of production and vigorously mobilize the masses. This policy was warmly supported by the vast number of peasants. At first, because the cadres preparing for the establishment of the Great Society were unsure of how large it should be, they only planned to establish a cooperative of 2,000 households and build an embankment of 14,000 mu. When this plan was announced, the peasants who were included in the plan were overjoyed, and the peasants who were not included were extremely anxious. Some even questioned the cadres of the preparatory committee, "Why do you include them and not us?" "How can you build a large embankment and watch us struggle at the bottom?" The peasants of Wuhe and Yonghe townships, hearing that they were not included in the plan, sent representatives to the Great Society preparatory committee overnight to negotiate, stating, "If you don't let us join the Great Society, don't you dare go home." Wu, an old man from Dongwang Village, Zhixi Township, had left his hometown for fifteen years due to floods before liberation. Hearing that a Great Society was to be established and a large embankment was to be built, he moved back. More and more people wanted to join the Great Society, greatly exceeding the original plan. At this time, a few cadres developed a fear of "bigness," believing that "adding one more household means adding one more trouble" and "a large cooperative with many people is difficult to manage." They advocated "closing the door" and not expanding. However, this attitude was immediately rejected by the masses. Eleven poor peasant households from Yangcun Agricultural Cooperative in Wuhe Township brought their rations and stayed in the preparatory committee office, demanding to join the Great Society. Hu Changli, a member of the preparatory committee, refused them, saying, "The Great Society is full, you can run a small cooperative for another year! What are you doing here?" These eleven poor peasant households were very angry when they heard this and accused him, "Are we wrong to rely on socialism? I think you're acting like a woman with bound feet!"

    In this situation, in order to do a good job of planning the establishment of the cooperative, the preparatory committee raised the question of "how to plan the Great Society well" and asked everyone to discuss it. In the discussion, everyone believed that the establishment of the Great Society should proceed from the benefit of building embankments and digging ditches to eradicate drought and flood disasters. It should include all the 25,000 mu of frequently flooded land within the embankment, and should not "cut off the head and tail." They also calculated two accounts: one account was that building a large embankment was better than building a small one, gaining one more mu for every mu built. Calculating at 300 jin of grain produced per mu, building a 14,000 mu embankment could only increase production by 4.2 million jin, while building a 25,000 mu embankment could increase production by 7.5 million jin. At the same time, building a large embankment could use old embankments and old riverbeds for the dikes, requiring only 400 mu of land to be destroyed, and could also enclose 2,000 mu of wasteland. Building a small embankment required opening new rivers and building new dikes, which would cost a lot of labor and destroy a lot of land, and the 2,000 mu of wasteland could not be enclosed. Another account was the labor force account. A cooperative with 2,000 households would only have 2,000-3,000 laborers to participate in building embankments and digging ditches, which was not enough. A cooperative with 5,000 households could draw out 5,000-6,000 laborers, which would be enough. Through discussion, everyone's understanding was enhanced, and the opinions of the masses were concentrated. The preparatory committee had a plan for how to establish the cooperative, recognizing that it should not be based solely on the number of households as a rigid requirement, but should be subject to the needs of production. As long as the masses were willing, it should be as large as possible, and there was no need to fear bigness. Those who originally did not advocate further expansion also recognized that "fearing bigness" was unfounded and that the view of "only seeking leadership convenience and disregarding production needs" was one-sided. On the basis of unified thinking, the preparatory committee revised the original plan for establishing the cooperative and allowed the peasants who needed to join the Great Society to join. As a result, the embankment plan was expanded from the original 14,000 mu to 25,000 mu, and the number of peasants joining the cooperative was also expanded from the original 2,000 households to 5,071 households.

    Five thousand households of peasants became a family, and 20,000 members were united as one. What small cooperatives could not do, the Great Society did. As soon as the Great Society was established, the embankment and ditch digging projects started. The peasants, who had suffered the pain of natural disasters for generations, were particularly enthusiastic when they heard that they were going to build an embankment. The first day, they planned to have 5,000 people carry soil, but 9,000 people actually arrived. At that time, it was the coldest time of the year, and water dripped into ice, but the members did not flinch because of this. They mustered soaring enthusiasm, overcame numerous difficulties, and finally built a large embankment 20 li long with their own hands, opened a flood drainage ditch 16 li long, opened three new irrigation canals, and built 52 culverts and sluices. In this way, even with 250 mm of heavy rain in three days, the 25,000 mu of low-lying land would not be flooded. Moreover, water from the Tonggong Dam was also introduced, so there was no fear of drought even if it did not rain for 100 days, and 2,000 mu of wasteland was also turned into fertile fields. The peasants' thousand-year wish was realized, and from then on, they would no longer "feel anxious when they encountered drought, and move their families when they saw floods." Member Li Youkun said with emotion, "My family has been farming low-lying land for three generations, which is like sitting in a water prison for three generations. If it weren't for the good leadership of the Communist Party, the establishment of the Great Society, and the building of the large embankment, I don't know when we would have been able to climb out of this water prison?"

    As soon as the water conservancy construction was finished, the tense spring plowing season arrived. In order to adapt to the needs of production, the eight small townships were merged into one Shuangqiao Township, becoming one township and one cooperative. However, the township and the cooperative were still two separate entities with two separate offices. Therefore, some new problems arose in actual work. For example, the township asked the lower levels for the progress of spring plowing production, and the cooperative also asked the lower levels for the same figures. In the production team, the same form had to be filled out twice, and the same situation had to be reported twice. The production team cadres asked the higher authorities for loans, and the township transferred it to the cooperative, which then pushed it back to the township for handling. The team cadres had a lot of opinions about this, saying, "You are either overlapping or shirking responsibility when production is so busy. Who is in charge?" Sometimes, when the county assigned work to the township, the township would simply pass it on to the cooperative for handling, and the township cadres had nothing to do. After discovering the above problems, in order to benefit work and facilitate leadership, the two entities were merged into one at that time, actually forming the integration of government and commune. In this way, problems that the lower levels requested to be resolved could be resolved in a timely manner, and work could be assigned to the lower levels or information could be gathered all the way to the bottom. What originally took two days to complete could be completed on the same day, and work efficiency was greatly improved. Not only that, but it also saved seven cadres, who were sent down to the teams to strengthen leadership, and office expenses were also reduced by half compared to the past. With the integration of government and commune, the original iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft cooperatives were merged into the Great Society's farm tool factory, and the original supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives were renamed the Great Society's supply and marketing department and credit department, and supply and marketing points and credit departments were established in each production brigade. Therefore, the handicraft production plan was more meticulous, and whatever was needed was made. Because there were more people, more funds, and more service points in the supply and marketing and credit work, the members felt very convenient.

    High and Low are Distinguished by Speaking and Comparing

    "Since the country is self-reliant." Since the masses voluntarily established the Great Society, of course they have the strength to run the Great Society well. Under the leadership of the Party, the members of the Shuangqiao Great Society overcame strong winds, floods, and droughts, struck at the evil trends of capitalism, and made the Great Society better and better, bigger and bigger. In the summer of 1956, this area encountered a level 12 typhoon and heavy rain that had not been seen for many years. More than 3,000 mu of ripe early rice was blown down, more than 10,000 mu of mid-season rice was submerged, 500 mu of cotton bolls fell to the ground, and 800 houses were destroyed. In this serious situation, the Great Society Party Committee resolutely led the members to resist the disaster. After three days and three nights of emergency action, they harvested the early rice, drained the floodwater, and planted small red rice, buckwheat, and mud beans on the submerged land to make up for the losses caused by the disaster. At the same time, the Great Society transferred more than 57,000 bricks and tiles and a large amount of bamboo and straw to repair the destroyed houses. Because the Great Society had great strength, the annual grain yield per mu reached 465 jin, an increase of 14% compared to the bumper year of 1955. In 1957, this area encountered another major flood. Although the large embankment protected some of the land, more than 20,000 mu of land was still flooded because the floodwaters were very fierce. Because the Great Society uniformly organized more than 4,700 laborers, it only took two days to drain the floodwater, and it also supported the Tonggong Township Agricultural Cooperative in plugging the breach. In that year, the grain yield per mu of the Shuangqiao Great Society was 480 jin, an increase of 15 jin compared to 1956.

    While fighting against natural disasters, the Shuangqiao Great Society also achieved great victories in the struggle between the two roads. In the first two years, because of a lack of experience in running the Great Society, some temporary and isolated minor shortcomings arose in the work. A few well-to-do middle peasants in the cooperative with serious capitalist ideas took the opportunity to spread fallacies and oppose the Great Society. Well-to-do middle peasant Zhao Jiayou said, "The Great Society, I think, is a mess. If we continue to do this, we will become poorer and poorer, and each year will be worse than the last." Under the influence of the well-to-do middle peasants' thinking, a few cadres with wavering standpoints also said, "A large cooperative cannot be run well, let's divide it up quickly!" At this time, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements also took the opportunity to carry out sabotage activities, attempting to bring down the Great Society.

    When this small adverse current impacted the Great Society, the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasant members were very angry and went to the Great Society Party Committee to expose them and demand to reason with these people. The poor and lower-middle peasant members of the Longxing Brigade, hearing that someone wanted to divide the cooperative, hurriedly found the captain Wang Jinyou and asked him to go to the Great Society to ask, "Who is so black-hearted?" and said, "Last year there was such a big wind and flood, if it weren't for the Great Society, we wouldn't even have thin porridge to drink. Now that they see that we have food and things to use, they want to break up the cooperative. We will fight to the death and not agree!" The Great Society Party Committee resolutely supported the demands of the majority of the masses and launched a socialist great debate throughout the cooperative in the winter of 1957. The central topic of the debate was "Is the Great Society good or not?" In the debate, the majority of members said that the Great Society was very good. Poor peasant Cui Yichang said, "The benefits of the Great Society cannot be fully described in three days and three nights, and ten books cannot say it all. If it weren't for the Great Society and the building of the large embankment in the past two years, could we have such a good life? In the past, we couldn't bear the floods, but now we can't finish eating the rice we harvest. We will live and die in the Great Society." Under the education of factual comparison, these well-to-do middle peasants were refuted into silence. Members who were originally ideologically confused also became clear-headed at this time. They said, "Without speaking and comparing, there is no bottom in our hearts. Once we speak and compare, we can distinguish the high and low. In the end, the Great Society is still good."

    After this debate, the members' socialist awareness was significantly improved, and the enthusiasm for production was universally high, promoting the great leap forward in agricultural production. In 1958, this area encountered an unprecedented 100-day drought. Because the Great Society had good water conservancy facilities, coupled with the heroic and hard work of all the members, they finally overcame the drought and achieved a great harvest. The grain yield per mu reached 800 jin, achieving the targets stipulated in the National Programme for Agricultural Development nine years ahead of schedule, which was 20% to 40% higher than the fourteen agricultural cooperatives in the nearby Tonggong and Zhengxing townships.

    A Solid Country is Easy to Defend

    The Great Society has done many major things, but with the development of production, new problems have arisen. The main problem is the contradiction in water conservancy with the fourteen agricultural cooperatives in Tonggong and Zhengxing townships upstream of the Tonggong Dam water system. For example, in the early stage of drought resistance in 1958, the water level of the Tonggong Dam was low, and the flow was small. As long as the old river channel was dredged, more river water could be diverted, irrigating an additional 7,000 mu of land, and 12,000 mu of waterwheel-irrigated land could be turned into gravity-irrigated land. To complete this project, 7,000 laborers were needed, and the county drought resistance headquarters organized the Shuangqiao Great Society and the two townships of Zhengxing and Tonggong to work together. However, the cadres and members of Tonggong and Zhengxing townships believed that "We use the water from the upper stream, and the water shortage is limited. Rather than digging the river, it is better to produce at home." The cadres of the Shuangqiao Great Society said, "Even if we get some water, it has to pass through the gates of Tonggong and Zhengxing. Those near the water get the moon first. We, who plant paddy fields downstream, will contribute more and benefit less." Due to mutual suspicion, the river dredging plan was never realized. For example, the water from the Tonggong Dam flows through Qidaoqiao into the east and west branch canals. The east branch canal irrigates the land of seven agricultural cooperatives in Zhengxing Township, and the west branch canal irrigates the land of the Shuangqiao Great Society. The land irrigated by the east branch canal is less, and most of the land is clay, with low seepage. The land irrigated by the west branch canal is more, and most of the land is sandy loam, with high water consumption. During the drought resistance period, the Tonggong Dam Management Committee, based on the above situation, added a gate board to the gate of the east branch canal to adjust some water to the west branch canal. This could maintain the minimum needs of the Shuangqiao Great Society, and the crops in Zhengxing Township would not be affected. However, after the members of Zhengxing Township learned about this situation, they felt that they had suffered a loss and clamored to remove the gate board, saying, "We bear the same burden when repairing the dam, and we should use the water equally. Even if we can't use the water, it's still ours." As a result, the seven agricultural cooperatives in Zhengxing Township stored some of the water they couldn't use and wasted some of it in the big river, while the Shuangqiao Great Society did not have enough water. Later, the drought intensified, and the water became less and less. Because these two problems were not resolved, more than 5,000 mu of rice in the Shuangqiao Great Society was irrigated two fewer times, and the agricultural cooperatives in Tonggong and Zhengxing townships also did not have enough water. More than 3,000 mu of rice was dry for a month. Calculating at a reduction of 100 jin per mu, more than 800,000 jin of grain was lost. At that time, everyone regretted it and said, "How good it would be if we could run the entire Tonggong Dam water system as a large cooperative!"

    Because the Shuangqiao Great Society was an early prototype of a commune, the members of the Shuangqiao Great Society and the surrounding agricultural cooperatives had long realized that the Great Society was superior to the small cooperatives and demanded that the Great Society be run even larger. Therefore, when the Party proposed the call to establish communes, a climax of establishing communes immediately formed here. At that time, drums and gongs were blaring, and everyone was cheering, writing applications, and expressing their determination to join the commune. Like going with the flow, the Shuangqiao Great Society and the fourteen agricultural cooperatives in Tonggong and Zhengxing townships merged to form the Shuangqiao People's Commune, with 14,207 households, more than 57,000 people, and more than 116,400 mu of land.

    After the establishment of the commune, the scope became larger, the human, material, and financial resources became more abundant, and the Tonggong Dam water system was unified. Therefore, a new situation appeared in water conservancy construction, drought and flood disasters were eradicated, and water resources were fully utilized, enabling various production undertakings to develop more rapidly and comprehensively.

    After the establishment of the commune, water conservancy construction developed from decentralized management to systematic management. In the winter of 1958 and the spring of 1959, the Shuangqiao People's Commune carried out fundamental treatment of the Tonggong Dam water system that runs through the entire commune, newly opened and renovated more than 4,600 large, medium, and small irrigation canals with a total length of 140 li, and deepened and widened the old river channel, connecting the irrigation channels of the entire water system with more than 1,700 ponds, dams, embankments, and ditches in the entire commune, forming a new and huge irrigation network. The irrigation area expanded from the original 42,000 mu to 85,000 mu, accounting for 80% of the commune's paddy field area. Among them, the gravity irrigation area expanded from the original 23,000 mu to 58,000 mu, accounting for 54.7% of the commune's paddy field area. At the same time, seven new reservoirs were built, enabling more than 20,000 mu of high land on the mountainside to also receive gravity irrigation.

    After the establishment of the commune, the contradiction between upstream and downstream water use in the Tonggong Dam was resolved, achieving rational water use. In July and August 1959, when crops needed water the most, there was another major drought that had not rained thoroughly for eighty days, bringing serious threats to production. Although this drought was not much lighter than the one in 1958, the drought resistance situation was very different. The commune made unified arrangements for water use based on the principle of overall consideration and ensuring key points. The cadres and members of the Zhengxing and Jianguo Brigades automatically added gate boards and blocked culvert gates, letting the water go to the Shuangqiao and Yangcun Brigades downstream. They no longer mentioned "equal water use," but said, "Water use must ensure key points and ensure high yields." Qingfeng Brigade, which was most susceptible to drought, was 50 li away from the Tonggong Dam and separated by the Shuiyang River. During the Great Society period, although a water aqueduct was built to divert water across the river, whenever there was a drought, the upstream agricultural cooperatives would block and restrict the water, and they would not be able to wait for the water to come down even if they looked forward to it. In 1958, more than 2,000 mu of rice suffered from drought because of this. In the drought resistance in 1959, due to the unified allocation of water by the commune, the upstream brigades opened the gates to let the water go. The 2,000 mu of rice in this brigade was not affected at all, and the yield per mu was more than 800 jin. Member Li Lijiu said with emotion, "In the past, we had to quarrel and fight to use a little pond water. Now, one shovel of water releases water for 50 li, and the dam water crossing the river is a miracle. The good weather and good land cannot compare to the good commune!" It is precisely because the water conservancy problem was fundamentally solved that not only was there no drought, but the rice planting area was also expanded. The area of double-cropping rice expanded from 26% of the paddy field area in 1958 to 65%, and the yield per mu in two seasons also increased from 855 jin in 1958 to 1,285 jin. The members compiled a jingle saying, "Individual farming requires asking the sky for water, quarreling and fighting endlessly; small cooperatives often worry about water, setting up checkpoints everywhere, water doesn't flow; communes have water everywhere, no worries about drought and flood, ensuring bumper harvests."

    After the establishment of the commune, water resources were more fully utilized. The commune invested 200,000 yuan to build five hydropower stations and sixteen grain processing plants using the water drop of the irrigation canals. This would have been difficult to do in the past agricultural cooperative period. Not only could the funds not be raised, but even if it was built, the water drop could not be controlled because the contradiction between upstream and downstream water use was not resolved, and power generation and processing could not be guaranteed. Now, at night, the threshing grounds are brightly lit, and the members no longer have to thresh rice in the dark. The towns are brightly lit and noisy, and the members are also accustomed to going to the towns at night to buy what they need. More than 2,500 member households have installed electric lights. Women do needlework under the lights, and children review their lessons under the lights.... The members call it the "night pearl," praising it and saying, "The stars in the sky are sparkling, the electric lights on the ground shine brightly, communism can be seen clearly, and production is more energetic." The grain processing plant can process more than 125,000 jin of rice every day. In addition to ensuring the grain supply for all members of the commune, it can also process grain for the state. Due to the expansion of gravity irrigation and the establishment of the grain processing plant, 450,000 workdays were saved in 1959, and the labor intensity of the members was greatly reduced. In the past, it was "walking in mid-air" (referring to waterwheels), now it is "releasing water to the end"; in the past, it was "lifting stones to pound rice," now it is "watching the machine spit out rice."

    Due to the unification of the irrigation water system, it also created favorable conditions for the development of aquaculture. Before the establishment of the commune, because water conservancy was not well built, the fish raised either died of drought or were washed away. In addition, the scope of the cooperatives was small at that time, and the economic interests were inconsistent. Although the large ponds and ditches shared by several cooperatives did not dry up all year round, they were afraid that if they raised fish, they would be caught by other cooperatives, so they were blocked and restrained, and very few were raised. As soon as the commune was established, a breeding farm was established to specialize in breeding fish fry, and all available water surfaces were utilized. The entire commune stocked a total of 13.08 million fish, an increase of 2.7 times compared to 1958 and an increase of 86 times compared to 1955 before the establishment of the Great Society. The members said, "Raising fish is also different after the establishment of the commune. We release fish whenever we see water. Anyway, the fish fry won't die of drought, and they won't swim out of the commune."

    In 1959, various production undertakings in the Shuangqiao Commune achieved more rapid and comprehensive development. The total annual income reached 14.24 million yuan, an increase of 55.6% compared to the great leap forward of 1958. The grain yield per mu reached 1,150 jin, an increase of 43.8% compared to 1958. With the development of production, the living standards of the members are steadily improving. The average income per member reached 135 yuan, an increase of 26% compared to 1958 and an increase of 1.1 times compared to 1955 before the establishment of the Great Society. The members are moving forward with confidence in victory. They said with joy, "A solid country is easy to defend, the people's commune will last forever."

　　人民公社应运而生
　　——早具人民公社雏型的安徽宣城双桥大社的成长和发展
    中共安徽省委　中共芜湖地委　中共宣城县委　工作组调查
    张立治　王传清执笔
    安徽省宣城县有一个早具人民公社雏型的双桥大社。双桥大社是1956年春天由八个乡的八十八个农业社合并办成的，有五千零七十一户，并实行了政社合一。从那时起，已经具有人民公社的雏型，因为大家想不出一个最恰当的名称，都叫它为双桥大社。1958年9月，在公社化运动高潮到来的时候，双桥大社又和周围十四个农业社合并，发展到一万四千二百零七户，正式称为双桥人民公社。
    有人说，人民公社没有经过试验，是“轰起来”的。双桥大社的成长和发展，有力地证明了这种论调是极其荒谬的。
    大社是群众自己要办的
    双桥大社是个南高北低的平畈区，东靠麻姑山，西临水阳江，来自佟公坝的水，由东南流向西北。在解放前，这里的水利建设极差，低地没有圩，高地没有沟，不是淹，就是旱，这里的农民过着十分悲惨的生活，他们称这个地方是“虾子窝”、“望天穷”。解放以后，特别是办了合作社以后，修了不少水利工程，使得农业生产有了提高，社员生活有了改善。但是，由于社小力量小，既不能集中更大力量兴建大工程，又不能作整体规划，就只能零打碎敲，小修小补地搞。所以，旱涝灾害就未能得到根治。这里有一片二万五千亩的低洼地，从1949年到1955年，七年中间就有四年淹、两年旱。群众形容这里是“连下三天雨，遍地行大船”，“晒上十来天，干得地冒烟”。当时，这里的农业社曾经三番五次地研究，打算在这里圈圩、挖沟，根除旱涝灾害，但是，社与社之间存在着一些难以解决的矛盾。圈圩挖沟，需要毁地四百亩，用工三十七万个。受益大、毁地少的社，都乐意干；受益小、毁地多的社，就不愿意干。土地多的社，每个劳动力要出三百个工，整整一年才能干完，对完成出工任务没有信心；土地少的社，每个劳动力只要出四、五十个工就行了，但是他们又怕多做了工吃亏。1954年冬天，土山、联合、大马岗等十三个小社，经过多次商量，抽出六百多个劳动力，打算圈一个九千亩的小圩，因为这些矛盾没有解决，只干了五天，就散掉了。这一事实，深刻地教育了当地群众。他们说：“要圈圩挖沟，就得小社并大社。”
    1955年秋天，毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示传达到这里以后，广大群众通过学习，提高了觉悟，解放了思想。已经入社的要求把社扩大，尚未入社的争着要入社。当时，中共宣城县委针对这里群众的要求，提出以并社为中心，结合扩社，并强调指出，在规划社的规模时，必须从有利于生产出发，大力发动群众。这一方针，得到了广大农民的热烈拥护。起初，因为筹办大社的干部对究竟要办多大为好，心中无底，只打算办一个两千户的社，圈一个一万四千亩的圩。当这个规划宣布以后，被规划在内的农民欢天喜地，被规划在外的农民急得要命，有的就质问筹委会干部：“带他们，为什么不带我们？”“你们圈大圩，怎能眼看我们钻‘锅底’？”五合、永和等乡的农民，听说他们不在规划之内，就连夜派代表，到大社筹委会去办交涉，并表示：“如果不带我们入大社，你们就不要回家。”直溪乡东王村的吴老头，在解放前因受水灾，背井离乡十五年，听到要办大社、圈大圩，又搬回来了。要求参加大社的人，越来越多，大大超过了原订的计划。这时候，有少数干部产生了一种怕“大”的思想，他们认为“多一户参加，就多添一个麻烦”，“社大人多心不齐，管不了”，主张“关门”，不扩大了。但是，这种态度马上被群众顶回来了。五合乡杨村农业社的十一户贫农带着口粮住到筹委会办公室，要求参加大社。筹委会委员胡长礼拒绝他们说：“大社满额了，你们再办一年小社吧！赖着不走干什么？”这十一户贫农听了非常生气，指责他说：“我们赖的是社会主义，还有错吗？我看你倒有点像小脚女人！”
    在这种情况下，筹委会为了做好办社规划，就提出“怎样把大社规划好”的问题，交大家讨论。在讨论中，大家认为，办大社应当从有利圈圩挖沟、根除旱涝灾害出发，应当将这里经常受涝的二万五千多亩土地全部圈进圩内，不应当“斩头去尾”。他们还算了两笔账：一笔账是圈小不如圈大，多圈一亩就多收一亩，以每亩多收三百斤粮食计算，圈一万四千亩只能增产四百二十万斤，圈二万五千亩就能增产七百五十万斤。同时，圈大圩，可以就老埂、老河道筑堤，只要毁地四百亩，还能圈进二千亩荒滩地；圈小圩，河要新开，埂要新修，工花得大，毁地也不少，二千亩荒滩也圈不进来。还有一笔是劳动力账。办二千户的社，能参加圈圩、挖沟的只有二、三千个劳动力，不够用；办五千户的社，能抽出五、六千个劳动力，就够用了。通过讨论，提高了大家的认识，集中了群众的意见。筹委会对如何规划办社，有了主张，认识到不能单纯根据户数多少作硬性规定，应当服从生产需要，只要群众自愿，能大就大，不要怕大。原来不主张再扩大的人，也认识到“怕大”是没有根据的，“只图领导方便，不顾生产需要”的看法是片面的。在统一思想的基础上，筹委会对原来办社计划作了修改，让需要进入大社的农民入社。结果，圈圩计划从原来的一万四千亩扩大到二万五千亩，入社农民也从原来的二千户扩大到五千零七十一户。
    五千户农民成了一家人，二万个社员连成一条心，小社办不到的事情，大社办到了。大社一成立，圈圩、挖沟工程就接着动工了。世世代代受尽自然灾害痛苦的农民，听到要圈圩，情绪格外高涨。头一天计划五千人挑土，实到的却有九千人。那时，正值四九寒天，滴水成冰，社员们并没有因此退缩。他们鼓起了冲天干劲，克服了重重困难，终于用自己的双手，修起了一条长达二十华里的大圩堤，开出了一条长达十六华里的排洪沟，新开出三道灌溉干渠，建成了五十二个涵洞水闸。这样，就使二万五千亩洼地，在三天内连下二百五十毫米大雨，也不会受涝了；并且还引进了佟公坝的水，就是百日不雨，也不怕干旱了，二千亩荒滩也变成了良田。农民们的千年愿望实现了，从此再也不会“碰到干旱心发焦，见了大水搬家跑”。社员李有坤感动地说：“我家种了三辈洼地，好比坐了三代水牢。要不是共产党领导好，办大社、修大圩，还不知几时能爬出这水牢呢？”
    兴修水利刚刚结束，紧张的春耕生产来到了。为了适应生产需要，八个小乡并成一个双桥乡，成为一乡一社，但是乡和社仍是两套班子，两处办公。因此，在实际工作中带来了一些新的问题。例如，乡里向下面要春耕生产进度情况，社里也向下面要同样数字。在生产队里，一样的表格要填双份，一样的情况要汇报两次。生产队的干部到上头要求贷款，乡转给社办，社又推给乡处理。队干部对此很有意见，说：“生产这样忙，你们不是重迭，就是推托，到底哪个作主？”有时，县里布置工作到乡，乡就过过手交给社办，乡干部闲得没事做。发现上述问题以后，为了有利工作，便于领导，当时就把两套班子并成了一套班子，实际上形成了政社合一。这样一来，下面要求解决的问题，都能够及时地得到解决，向下面布置工作或者了解情况，能够一竿子到底，原来需要两天才能办成的事情，当天就办完了，工作效率提高很多。不但如此，还节省了七个干部，下放到队里加强领导，办公费用也比过去减少一半。随着政社的合一，原来的铁、木、竹手工业社归并到大社农具厂，原来的供销社和信用社改称为大社的供销部和信用部，并在各个生产大队设立供销点和信用部。因此，手工业生产计划更加周密了，要什么就做什么。供销和信用工作因为人手多了，资金足了，服务点增加了，社员感到很方便。
    一讲一比就分高低
    “自打江山自家蹬”。既然群众自愿地办起了大社，当然也有力量把大社办好。双桥大社的社员在党的领导下，战胜了大风、大水、大旱，打击了资本主义的歪风邪气，把大社办得越来越好，越来越大。1956年夏天，这里遇到多年未有的十二级大台风和大暴雨，三千多亩黄熟的早稻刮倒了，一万多亩的中稻淹没了，五百亩棉桃掉地了，八百多间房屋刮坏了。在这个严重的情况下，大社党委坚决领导社员抗灾，经过三天三夜的突击，抢割了早稻，排出了积水，在淹没的土地上又种上小红稻、荞麦和泥豆，弥补了受灾的损失。同时，大社又调出五万七千多块砖瓦和大批毛竹、稻草，修好了被刮坏的房屋。由于大社力量大，全年的粮食亩产达到四百六十五斤，比丰收年成的1955年还增产14％。1957年，这里又遇到了特大洪水，虽然大圩保住了一部分土地，因为洪水来势很猛，仍然有二万多亩土地被淹。由于大社统一组织了四千七百多个劳动力，只两天工夫就把积水排出了，并且还支援了佟公乡农业社堵住了决口。当年，双桥大社粮食亩产四百八十斤，比1956年增产十五斤。
    双桥大社在与自然灾害作斗争的同时，在两条道路的斗争中，也取得巨大的胜利。头两年，因为缺乏办大社的经验，工作上产生了一些暂时的、个别的小缺点，社内少数有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农，就借此大发谬论，反对大社。富裕中农赵家有说：“大社，我看是乱糟糟，这样干下去，越搞越穷，一年不如一年。”在富裕中农的思想影响下，少数立场不坚定的干部也跟着说：“社大了就办不好，赶快分掉吧！”这时，地、富、反、坏分子也乘机进行破坏活动，妄想搞垮大社。
    当这一小股逆流冲击大社的时候，极大多数贫农、下中农社员，都非常气愤，纷纷找大社党委进行揭发，要求跟这些人评评理。隆兴大队的贫农、下中农社员听说有人要分社，急忙找队长王金有，要他到大社去问：“是谁这样黑良心？”并说：“去年这样大风大水，要不是办大社，连稀粥也喝不上，现在看到我们有吃有用的，就要闹散社，我们拼掉命也不答应！”大社党委坚决支持了大多数群众的要求，于1957年冬天，在全社范围内展开了社会主义大辩论。辩论的中心题目是“大社到底好不好？”在辩论中，大多数社员都说大社好得很。贫农崔宜昌说：“大社的好处，三天三夜讲不尽，十本书也说不完，这两年要不是办了大社，圈了大圩，能有这样好日子过吗？过去受了水灾吃不消，现在收的稻子吃不了，我们死活都要在大社。”在事实对比教育下，这些富裕中农被驳得哑口无言。原来思想模糊的社员，这时也清醒了。他们说：“不讲不比，心中无底，一讲一比，就分高低，到底还是大社好。”
    经过这场辩论，社员的社会主义觉悟有了显著提高，生产情绪普遍高涨，促进了农业生产的大跃进。1958年，这里遇到了前所未有的百日大旱，因为大社水利修得好，加上全体社员的奋勇苦战，终于战胜了干旱，取得了大丰收，粮食亩产达到八百斤，提前九年实现了农业发展纲要规定的指标，比附近的佟公、正兴两个乡十四个农业社高出二成到四成。
    铁打江山坐得稳
    大社办了许多大事，但是随着生产的发展，又产生了新的问题。主要是与佟公坝水系上游的佟公、正兴两个乡的十四个农业社，在水利上发生了矛盾。例如，在1958年抗旱初期，佟公坝的水位低，流量少，只要疏通老河口河道，就能够多引江水，增灌七千亩田，并且能使一万二千亩车水田变成自流灌溉。要完成这一工程，就需要七千个劳动力，县抗旱指挥部就组织双桥大社和正兴、佟公两个乡共同来搞。可是佟公和正兴乡的干部和社员认为：“我们用的是上口水，缺水也有限，与其挖河，不如在家生产。”双桥大社的干部说：“就是搞到一点水，都要从佟公、正兴的门口过，近水楼台先得月，我们种下水田的，是出力大受益小。”由于互相怀疑，疏河计划一直没有实现。又如，佟公坝的水从七道桥分别流向东、西两条支渠。东支渠灌溉正兴乡七个农业社的土地，西支渠灌溉双桥大社的土地；东支渠灌溉的土地少，大部分土地是粘土，渗漏量小，西支渠灌溉的土地多，大部分土地是沙壤土，耗水量大。在抗旱时，佟公坝坝委会根据以上情况，在东支渠的闸门上加一块闸板，调剂一部分水给西支渠，这样既可以维持双桥大社的最低需要，而正兴乡的庄稼也不会受到影响。可是正兴乡的社员知道这个情况以后，认为自己吃了亏，就闹着把闸板抽掉，并说：“修坝时同样负担，用水也要平均，水用不了也是我们的。”结果，正兴乡的七个农业社把用不了的水，有些蓄起来了，有些淌到大河里浪费掉了，而双桥大社的水却不够用。以后，旱情发展了，水越来越少，因为这两个问题没有解决，双桥大社的五千多亩水稻，少灌了二遍水，佟公、正兴两个乡的农业社，水也不够用了，有三千多亩稻子干了一个月。以每亩减收一百斤计算，少收了八十多万斤粮食。那时，大家很后悔，都这样说：“能把整个佟公坝水系办一个大社，那有多好！”
    因为双桥大社早具公社雏型，双桥大社和周围农业社的社员早就体会到大社比小社优越，并且要求把大社办得更大。所以，当党提出办公社的号召以后，这里立即形成了一个办公社的高潮。那时，锣鼓喧天，万众欢腾，人人写申请，个个表决心，要求参加公社。像顺水推舟一样，双桥大社和佟公、正兴两个乡的十四个农业社，合并办起了一个拥有一万四千二百零七户、五万七千多人、十一万六千四百多亩土地的双桥人民公社。
    公社建立以后，范围更大了，人力、物力、财力更加雄厚了，佟公坝水系统一了。因此，水利建设出现了一个新的局面，旱涝灾害得到了根除，水利资源得到了充分利用，使得各项生产事业更迅速更全面地发展起来。
    办了公社以后，水利建设由分散治理发展到系统治理。在1958年冬天和1959年春天，双桥人民公社对贯通全社的佟公坝水系，进行了根治，新开和整修了四千六百多条，总长达一百四十华里的大、中、小灌溉渠，又把老河口河道加深加宽，使整个水系的灌溉渠道与全公社一千七百多处塘、坝、圩、沟联在一起，形成了一个新的巨大的灌溉网，灌溉面积由原来四万二千亩扩大到八万五千亩，占全社水田面积的80％。其中，自流灌溉面积由原来二万三千亩扩大到五万八千亩，占全社水田面积的54.7％。同时，还新建了七座水库，使两万多亩山边高地也能够得到自流灌溉。
    办了公社以后，佟公坝上下游用水的矛盾解决了，做到了合理用水。1959年7、8月间，正是农作物最需要水的时候，这里又出现了八十天未下透雨的大旱，给生产带来了严重的威胁。虽然这次旱象不比1958年轻多少，但是抗旱情况却大不相同。公社根据统筹兼顾、保证重点的原则，对水的使用作了统一安排。正兴、建国大队的干部和社员自动加闸板、堵涵闸，把水让给下游的双桥、杨村大队。他们再也不提“平均用水”了，而是说：“用水要保证重点，保证高产。”最容易受旱的庆丰大队，离佟公坝有五十里路，还隔了一道水阳江，在大社时期，虽然造起了一个引水过江的水渡槽，但是一遇到天旱，上游农业社就拦的拦，卡的卡，望穿眼睛也等不到水下来，1958年，二千多亩稻子就因此受了旱。在1959年抗旱中，由于公社统一调度用水，上游的大队都开闸让水，这个大队的二千多亩稻子，一点也没有受到影响，亩产都在八百斤以上。社员李立久感动地说：“过去为了车一点塘水，也要吵嘴打架，现在一锹放水五十里，坝水过江出奇迹，天好地好，也比不上公社好啊！”正由于从根本上解决了水利问题，不仅做到了大旱不干，而且扩大了水稻种植面积。双季稻从1958年占水田面积的26％，扩大到65％，两季亩产也从1958年的八百五十五斤提高到一千二百八十五斤。社员们编了一首顺口溜说：“单干要水向天求，你争我夺吵不休；小社要水常发愁，各设关卡水不流；公社要水处处有，旱涝无忧保丰收。”
    办了公社以后，水利资源更充分地利用起来了。公社投资二十万元，利用灌溉干渠水的落差，建立了五座水力发电站和十六个粮食加工厂。这在过去农业社时期是很难办到的，不但资金凑集不起来，就是建成了，也因为上下游用水的矛盾没有解决，水的落差无法控制，就不能保证发电加工。现在，一到晚上，稻场上一片明亮，社员们再也不用摸黑打稻了。集镇上灯光辉煌，喧喧嚷嚷，社员也习惯在晚上到集镇上选购自己需要的东西了。有二千五百多户社员家里已装上了电灯，妇女们在灯光下，做做针线活；孩子们在灯光下，温习功课……。社员们称它为“夜明珠”，歌颂说：“天上星星亮晶晶，地下电灯放光明，共产主义看得清，生产越干越有劲。”粮食加工厂，每天能加工米十二万五千多斤，除了保证全社社员的口粮供应，还能为国家加工粮食。由于扩大了自流灌溉，办了粮食加工厂，1959年就节省出四十五万个劳动日，并且还大大减轻了社员的劳动强度。过去是“半天空走路”（指车水），现在是“一锹放到底”；过去是“举石头打臼”，现在是“看机器吐米”。
    由于统一了灌溉水系，也为发展水产事业创造了有利条件。在办公社以前，因为水利没有修好，放养的鱼，不是干死，就是冲跑；加上那时社的范围小，经济利益不一致，几个社共用的大塘、大沟，虽然终年不干，因为怕放养了给外社捕去，拦拦扎扎，养得很少。公社一成立，办起了一个养殖场，专门繁殖鱼苗，凡是可以利用的水面都利用起来了。全社共放养了一千三百零八万尾鱼，比1958年增加二点七倍，比办大社前的1955年增加八十六倍。社员们说：“办了公社，养鱼也不一样了，见水就放，反正干不死鱼秧，游不出公社。”
    1959年，双桥公社的各项生产事业得到更迅速更全面的发展。全年总收入达到一千四百二十四万元，比大跃进的1958年增加55.6％。粮食亩产达到一千一百五十斤，比1958年增加43.8％。随着生产发展，社员生活水平蒸蒸日上。社员每人平均收入达到一百三十五元，比1958年增加26％，比办大社前的1955年增加一点一倍。社员们正满怀着胜利的信心，大踏步地向前迈进。他们欢欣鼓舞地说：“铁打江山坐得稳，人民公社万万年。”
