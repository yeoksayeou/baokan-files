Our newspaper Urumqi, 8th dispatch: Severe winter has descended on our country's northwest frontier. In Xinjiang, along the three thousand li of snow-covered line from Hami in the east to Horgos in the west, the temperature has dropped to more than twenty degrees below zero, but hundreds of thousands of water conservancy troops remain high in morale and full of energy. The number of workers at each construction site is increasing, and the progress of the project is accelerating. As of now, about 30% of the total earth and stone work of the water conservancy project has been completed. This is a great achievement made by the Party committees at all levels in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in this winter's water conservancy construction campaign, by grasping both production and life.

Xinjiang has a long and particularly cold winter. This year's water conservancy construction is more than twice the scale of last year and the year before. Since mid-November, 800,000 water conservancy troops braved wind and snow to enter the construction site. They eat in the wilderness, sleep in the wilderness, and work in the wilderness, constantly engaging in tenacious struggles with the frozen land and severe cold climate. This makes winter water conservancy projects not only overcome the difficulties brought by the severe cold to construction, but also overcome the difficulties brought by the severe cold to the lives of the migrant workers.

In order to ensure that the vast number of migrant workers live well on the construction site and that the project is not affected by the severe winter, the Party committees at all levels have initially grasped the solution of cold-proof equipment on the construction site and the food and accommodation of the migrant workers. At the same time, they have also strengthened the medical and health work on the construction site to ensure that migrant workers receive immediate medical treatment when they get sick. At present, thousands of wind-proof and warm earthen houses and tents have been established on the three-thousand-li water conservancy construction site from Hami in the east to Horgos in the west. The public canteens of the people's communes have moved to the construction site in large numbers, and the transportation teams of the communes are rushing to transport grain, coal and various cold-proof supplies day and night. More than two hundred construction site hospitals have also been established. Generally, the construction site ensures that everyone has a house to live in, every house has a stove, and when the migrant workers return from work, the room is as warm as spring, and they can eat their fill, eat warmly, and sleep well. Hami County's people's communes have adopted the method of "grain and grass go first before the troops move," transporting grain and coal to the construction site before the start of construction, and timely transporting a large amount of vegetables and meat to the Nanhu Reservoir, Wubao Reservoir and other remote water conservancy construction sites. Each construction site generally reserves fresh vegetables such as cabbage and potatoes that can be eaten for one to two months. The construction site canteen has steamed buns, vegetables and soup for each meal. Many construction sites have also organized hunting teams to hunt gazelles and wild rabbits to supply the construction site canteen to improve life. At the Ulabo Reservoir construction site in Urumqi, the Party committee listed improving the lives of workers as an important work project, and the Party committee set up a special person to lead the life on the construction site. Seventeen construction sites have food warming equipment to ensure that migrant workers can eat hot meals and hot dishes at any time. The cooks of each canteen personally carry meals, dishes and boiling water to the construction site. Barber shops, sewing shops, daily necessities and bookstores, post and telecommunications departments have also set up service stations and mobile teams on the construction site. In order to adapt to the cold climate of northern Xinjiang, the water conservancy construction sites in Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture have built fire walls and stoves in all earthen houses, and mobilized workers to use their rest time to make hundreds of thousands of bundles of grass and spread them on the kangs to sleep warmly and softly. Windbreak walls were also built in front of the doors, and cotton curtains or grass curtains were hung at the entrances to prevent wind and snow, so that everyone could rest well.

Ensuring the health of the water conservancy construction army is an important task on the water conservancy construction site. More than 1,000 medical and health personnel in various parts of the autonomous region have gone to the construction site with medicine kits, established temporary hospitals, carried out health care work on the construction site, and treated migrant workers. Forty-seven construction sites in Changji area have established construction site hospitals. More than 100 doctors and nurses carry medicine bags and patrol the construction site every day, inspecting each team. Wherever patients are found, they are treated there, so that the number of sick people on the construction site is significantly reduced. The Zepu County Hospital is particularly enthusiastic about supporting water conservancy construction. Doctors and nurses have moved to the construction site on the east bank of the Yarkand River and adopted the method of contracting by area, traveling dozens of miles to various construction sites to treat diseases. They also work with migrant workers in their spare time, which has been praised by the masses. A health care network has been established at the Ulabo construction site in Urumqi, and the masses are often informed of winter health knowledge. Medical personnel also help each team train health workers, and supervise and inspect the canteen and environmental hygiene at any time. Therefore, there are very few sick people, and the attendance rate often remains above 97%, and many teams with full-day attendance have emerged.

    新疆水利工地温暖如家
    人人有屋住　屋屋有火炉　饭菜热又香　一心修水利
    本报乌鲁木齐8日电　严冬已降临我国西北边疆。在新疆境内东起哈密西至霍尔果斯三千里风雪线上，气温已低到零下二十多度，但是数十万水利大军始终斗志昂扬，干劲冲天。各个工地上工人数越来越多，工程进度越来越快，截至目前，已经完成水利工程全部土石方的30％左右。这是新疆维吾尔自治区各地党委在今年冬修水利运动中，一手抓生产、一手抓生活所获得的巨大成果。
    新疆冬季较长，也特别冷。今年兴修水利的规模比去年和前年都要大一倍多，八十万名水利大军从11月中旬就冒着风雪进入工地。他们吃在荒野，睡在荒野，劳动在荒野，要不断同冰冻的土地和严寒的气候展开顽强搏斗。这就使冬季水利工程不仅要克服严寒给施工带来的困难，而且要克服严寒给民工生活带来的困难。
    各地党委为了保证广大民工过好工地生活，使工程在严冬不受影响，一开始就抓紧解决工地上的防寒设备和民工吃住等问题，同时还加强工地医疗卫生工作，保证民工生了病立即就有医生治疗。目前在东起哈密西至霍尔果斯三千里水利工地上，已经建立起几千个防风保暖的地窝子和帐篷，各人民公社的公共食堂已大批搬上工地，各公社运输队正日夜赶运粮食、煤炭和各种御寒用品，二百多个工地医院也已建立起来。一般工地都作到人人有屋住，屋屋有火炉，民工劳动归来，室内温暖如春，而且吃得饱，吃得暖，睡得好。哈密县各人民公社采取“兵马未动，粮草先行”的办法，在开工之前就把粮食和煤炭运到工地，并及时为南湖水库、五堡水库等较远的水利工地运送了大量蔬菜和肉类。各工地一般都储备了能吃一个月到两个月的白菜、洋芋等鲜菜，工地食堂每顿有馍、有菜、有汤，许多工地还组织了打猎队，猎取黄羊、野兔，供应工地食堂改善生活。在乌鲁木齐乌拉泊大水库工地上，党委把搞好工人生活列为重要工作项目，党委会设专人领导工地生活。十七个工地都有食物保暖设备，保证民工随时吃到热饭热菜。各食堂炊事员亲自挑着饭菜和开水送到工地。理发、缝纫、日用百货和书店、邮电等部门，也在工地设立了服务站和流动组。昌吉回族自治州各水利工地上，为了适应北疆气候寒冷的特点，在所有地窝子里都砌上火墙和火灶，并发动工人利用休息时间，打了几十万捆草铺在炕上，睡上又暖又软。门前还修起挡风墙，门口还挂了棉帘或草帘，预防风雪，使大家休息得很好。
    保证水利建设大军身体健康，是当前水利工地上一件重要工作。自治区各地已有一千多名医务人员和保健人员背着药箱下到工地，建立起临时医院，一面开展工地保健工作，一面为民工治病。昌吉地区四十七个工地都已建立了工地医院，一百多名医生和护士每天背着药包在工地巡回，逐队检查，哪里发现病人，就在哪里医治，使工地病号显著减少。泽普县医院对支援水利建设特别热情，医生和护士都搬到叶尔羌河东岸的工地上，采用分片包干的办法，要奔走几十里到各工地治病，利用空隙时间还和民工一起劳动，受到群众的赞扬。乌鲁木齐乌拉泊工地已建立起保健网，经常向群众宣传冬季卫生知识。医务人员还帮助各队训练保健员，随时督促检查食堂和环境卫生，因而病号很少，出勤率经常保持在97％以上，并出现很多全日全勤的队。
