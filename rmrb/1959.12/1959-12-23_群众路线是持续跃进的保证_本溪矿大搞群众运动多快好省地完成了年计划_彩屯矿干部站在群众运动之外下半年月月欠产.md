　　The Mass Line Is the Guarantee of Sustained Leap Forward
    Benxi Mine Achieves Annual Plan Quickly, Economically, and Well Through Mass Movement
    Caitun Mine Cadres Stand Outside the Mass Movement, Resulting in Monthly Production Shortfalls in the Second Half of the Year
    (Our Newspaper News) The leading cadres of Benxi and Caitun coal mines, affiliated with the Benxi Mining Bureau, adopted two different approaches and work methods this year, resulting in vastly different economic outcomes.

    These two coal mines are built on the same coalfield. Benxi Mine has been mined for over fifty years, with shallow and scarce resources, and most working faces are irregular, making mining difficult, and the equipment is relatively old. The Caitun Mine next to it was newly built in 1954, with regular and easily mined working faces, new equipment, and a total capacity three times larger than Benxi Mine. However, Benxi Mine fully utilized the subjective initiative of its employees, rejuvenating the old mine, and completed the annual state plan ahead of schedule, quickly, economically, and well, by twenty-five days. Caitun Mine, on the other hand, experienced a serious constraint on the potential of both people and equipment, and monthly production shortfalls occurred especially in the second half of the year. Compared with Benxi Mine in terms of major economic indicators this year, the efficiency of coal extraction workers was 5% lower, the quality of the same type of coal was 12% lower, and the unit cost was 15.8% higher. The original designed total output of Caitun Mine was 400,000 tons higher than that of Benxi Mine, and the actual output last year was more than 200,000 tons higher. However, this year, Benxi Mine has exceeded Caitun Mine by more than 20,000 tons.

    Why has Benxi Mine, with its poor objective conditions, achieved an overall leap forward, while Caitun Mine, with its good objective conditions, experienced slow, poor, and wasteful production? The main reason is that the leading cadres of Benxi Mine adhered to putting politics in command and bravely stood at the forefront of the mass movement. The Party Committee of this mine is a strong leading core of the entire mine, capable of promptly and correctly concentrating on the problems in production and the demands of the workers, coming up with corresponding resolutions and methods, and then having each leading member take these resolutions and methods to the production front to implement them with the workers. For example, failure to complete tasks whenever the working face was moved was a past "routine." Starting in August, the cadres organized themselves to work specifically on the preparation of the working face before mining, working with the workers to meticulously carry out equipment inspection, installation, test operation, and other preparatory work, so that the official coal mining started smoothly. Although fifteen working faces were moved that month, the plan was still overfulfilled by 7%. Until now, this mine has never had production affected by moving the working face. The leading cadres of this mine grasped production and management both meticulously and deeply. They implemented the "three-way combination" method to supplement and revise ninety-four rules and regulations, and at the same time, incorporated advanced experiences created inside and outside the mine, such as "four-shift staggered operation" and "blasting coal mining," into the technical regulations. Initially, some grassroots cadres and workers found "blasting coal mining" troublesome and feared accidents. The Party Secretary, Mine Director, and Chief Engineer formed a working group and went down to the mine to explore a set of experiences, set an example, and demonstrated to the workers, which quickly resolved the workers' concerns and practical difficulties, enabling the comprehensive promotion of this experience and a sharp increase in production efficiency of 20%.

    Caitun Mine was just the opposite. The leading cadres abandoned many of the experiences related to political and ideological work accumulated in the past rectification movements. They always stood outside the mass movement, making comments and giving directions, holding many meetings, shouting empty slogans, and rarely going down to the mine to work with the workers to solve key problems. The problem of frequent loss of chains on the chutes was discovered at the beginning of this year, but they always shouted empty slogans like "must eliminate," but never took concrete measures. As a result, four thousand meters of chains were replenished this year, but more than three thousand six hundred meters have already been lost, seriously affecting production. Production often fell short of the plan in the second half of the year. The superior Party Committee instructed them to mobilize the masses to carry out competitions and technological innovations, but they believed that "this has to wait until production improves." The leading cadres generally arranged production and management work level by level and in a "broad and general" manner downwards; there were many resolutions, but most of them were not feasible. There were dozens of regulations on safe production, but equipment accidents were two and a half times higher than those of Benxi Mine.

    The difference between the good and bad leadership work of these two mines this year has also had different impacts on production next year. Benxi Mine has gained the initiative, and 90% of the coal mining faces needed for the first quarter of next year have been prepared, creating important conditions for continued leap forward; Caitun Mine still has many difficulties in completing this year's plan, and the production preparation for next year has not yet been started.

    In order to completely reverse the passive situation of Caitun Mine's production, the CPC Benxi Municipal Committee recently held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee in Caitun Mine, deeply analyzed the reasons for the slow, poor, and wasteful performance of this mine, and helped to formulate revolutionary measures to catch up with advanced mines.

　　群众路线是持续跃进的保证
    本溪矿大搞群众运动多快好省地完成了年计划
    彩屯矿干部站在群众运动之外下半年月月欠产
    本报讯　本溪矿务局所属本溪和彩屯两个煤矿的领导干部，今年走了两条不同的路线，采取了两种不同的工作方法，收到了相差悬殊的经济效果。
    这两座煤矿建在同一个煤田上。本溪矿已开采五十多年，资源浅少，工作面大都不规则，开采较难，设备也较陈旧；在它旁边的彩屯矿，是1954年新建的，工作面规则易采，设备新，总容量比本溪矿大三倍。但是，本溪矿充分发挥了职工的主观能动作用，使老矿青春常在，已经提前二十五天多快好省地完成了全年国家计划。彩屯矿则是另一种情况，人和设备的潜力受到严重束缚，下半年更是月月欠产。今年的主要经济指标和本溪矿比较，回采工人效率低5％，同煤种的质量低12％，单位成本高15.8％。原来的设计总产量，彩屯矿高于本溪矿四十万吨，去年实际产量还高出二十多万吨，而今年的产量，本溪矿却已经超过彩屯矿两万多吨。
    为什么本溪矿客观条件差，出现了全面跃进的局面，而彩屯矿客观条件好，生产却少慢差费呢？主要原因在于：本溪矿的领导干部坚持了政治挂帅，勇敢地站在群众运动的最前线。这个矿的党委是全矿坚强的领导核心，能及时正确地集中生产中的问题和职工群众的要求，拿出相应的决议和办法，然后由各领导成员带着这些决议和办法，分头去生产前线和职工一起贯彻执行。例如，每逢挪掌子面就完不成任务，是过去的“常规”；从8月份开始，干部们组织起来，专门到开采前的备掌子上劳动，和工人一起细致地进行设备检修、安装、试运转等准备工作，使正式采煤一开头就很顺利。当月虽然有十五个掌子挪动，仍然超额7％完成了计划。直到现在，这个矿从未因挪掌子而影响生产。这个矿的领导干部对生产和管理抓得又细又深。他们实行“三结合”，补充修订了九十四项规程制度，同时把矿内外创造的先进经验，如“四班交叉作业”、“放炮采煤”等，都纳入了技术规程。起初，部分基层干部和工人对“放炮采煤”嫌麻烦，怕出事故；党委书记、矿长、总工程师等便组成了工作组，下矿井先摸索了一套经验，作出样子，向工人示范，结果很快解决了工人的顾虑和实际困难，使这一经验全面推广开了，生产效率猛升了20％。
    彩屯矿恰恰相反。领导干部们把过去整风积累的有关政治思想工作的许多经验，都放弃了。他们总是站在群众运动之外指手划脚，开会多，空喊多，很少下矿井和职工一起劳动，解决关键问题。今年年初就发现了溜子上的链子常丢失的问题，但老是空喊“要杜绝”，却从不采取具体措施。结果今年补充了四千米链子，至今已丢失了三千六百多米，严重影响了生产。下半年经常完不成计划，上级党委指示他们要发动群众开展竞赛，革新技术，他们却认为“这得等生产好转以后再搞”。领导干部对生产和管理工作，一般都是一级一级地、“大而化之”地向下布置；决议很多，但大都行不通。有关安全生产的制度不下几十条，设备事故却比本溪矿高出两倍半。
    这两个矿今年领导工作好坏的差异，对明年的生产也产生了不同的影响。本溪矿由于争得了主动，明年第一季度需要的采煤工作面已经准备好90％，为继续跃进创造了重要条件；彩屯矿完成今年计划尚有很多困难，明年的生产准备还没有来得及着手。
    中共本溪市委为了彻底扭转彩屯矿生产的被动局面，最近在彩屯矿召开了扩大常委会，深刻地分析了这个矿造成少慢差费的原因，帮助订出了赶先进矿的革命性措施。
