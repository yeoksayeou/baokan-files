Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 13th: Representatives of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese students attending the preparatory meeting of the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the First Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese deeply cared about the overseas Chinese in Indonesia who had suffered extremely brutal and inhumane treatment, and they earnestly hoped that overseas Chinese who were displaced or unwilling to continue living in Indonesia would return to the motherland and participate in the great socialist construction of the motherland.

Representatives of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese students from more than 20 provinces and cities across the country have been speaking at group meetings of the preparatory meeting or submitting letters and written statements to the meeting in recent days, expressing serious protests against the frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese activities carried out by the Indonesian reactionary forces, and expressing unlimited concern for the difficult situation of overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Chairman of the National People's Congress and Deputy Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that our great motherland has always warmly welcomed overseas Chinese to return from abroad to participate in the great cause of socialist construction. According to the policy of "treating everyone equally and providing appropriate care," we have properly arranged the work and life of 300,000 returned overseas Chinese in the past ten years, and dozens of overseas Chinese farms have been established solely to arrange for homeless returned overseas Chinese. The production and construction of these farms have greatly developed in recent years, and the living standards of the farm members have also significantly improved. Many returned overseas Chinese have become model workers and advanced producers under the cultivation of the Party and the government, and have been respected by the broad masses of the people. Now, when overseas Chinese in Indonesia are suffering from the inhumane bullying and persecution of local reactionary forces, the people of the motherland are even more concerned about the safety of their lives and property, and are more enthusiastically preparing to receive their own overseas Chinese back to the motherland.

Huang Changshui, representative of the National People's Congress and Deputy Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to the Indonesian Foreign Minister not only strongly reflected the Chinese people's desire to maintain friendly relations between the two countries, but also once again embodied the Chinese government's position of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Over the past decade, the state has consistently implemented the policy of protecting overseas remittances and deposits, and has promulgated preferential measures for overseas Chinese investment, and established overseas Chinese new villages. All of this is a concrete manifestation of the deep care of the motherland government for overseas Chinese. The era when overseas Chinese were helpless and had no country to return to in the old China is long gone; if anyone still thinks that the Chinese government and the 650 million Chinese people will sit idly by while overseas Chinese are subjected to unwarranted discrimination and persecution overseas, then they are terribly wrong.

Gao Zhirong, Deputy County Head of Fuqing County, Fujian, an overseas Chinese hometown, and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that Fuqing County used to be poor and blank, and under the reactionary rule, many people flowed overseas, many of whom lived in Indonesia. However, the current Fuqing County has completely changed, especially after communization, the total industrial output value reached more than 20 million yuan, an increase of about 20 times compared with 1949; the Dongzhang Reservoir was built, benefiting an area of 310,000 mu, which freed the local area from the threat of nine droughts in ten years. Last year, it changed from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county, and this year's late rice has also achieved a bumper harvest. People's lives are getting better and better, and no one is leaving their homes to make a living abroad anymore. In recent years, overseas Chinese who have returned to China have been properly resettled by the government. Next year, Fuqing County's construction undertakings will have greater leaps forward. Gao Zhirong said that he, on behalf of the people of Fuqing County, warmly welcomes overseas Chinese who are displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue living in Indonesia to return to their country and hometown, and build the motherland and their hometown together with the people of the motherland.

Fan Huiqun, a representative from Dabu County, Guangdong, said that many overseas Chinese from our county live in Indonesia. Since Indonesia adopted anti-Chinese measures, many relatives and returned overseas Chinese have been worried about the lives and property of their relatives. After reading Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter, we felt the infinite warmth of the motherland. He said that with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the incomparably superior people's communes, our future is infinitely bright, and we hope that our relatives abroad will return to build their hometowns together.

Zhou Fangshui, a representative from Guangxi and a returned overseas Chinese from Vietnam, said that Guangxi has overseas Chinese farms specially set up for returned overseas Chinese. The climate here is warm and suitable for the living habits of overseas Chinese, and they can fully exert their technical expertise. We welcome overseas Chinese to come to Guangxi and build our great motherland with us. Chen Shaonan, a representative from Tianmen County, Hubei, and other representatives of more than 20,000 relatives and returned overseas Chinese in the province, welcomed their relatives back. They said that we are making all preparations for overseas Chinese to return to participate in production, work, and study. Deng Mijian, the sixty-year-old head of the Overseas Chinese Fruit Farm in Donghua Township, Longyan, Fujian, who had lived in Indonesia for three generations, also expressed the same wish. Yan Xiyue, Chairman of the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Federation and a returned overseas Chinese, who had lived in Indonesia for three generations, also expressed a warm welcome to overseas Chinese to return to the embrace of the motherland and build the great motherland. Zhou Shaowen, a student of the Guangzhou Returned Overseas Chinese Students' Secondary Remedial School, representing all the students of the school, expressed his willingness to do all the preparation work for the returned overseas Chinese students to come back to study.

In their speeches, representatives from various places continued to seriously protest the large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese activities launched by the Indonesian reactionary forces. They demanded that the Indonesian government immediately, in accordance with Foreign Minister Chen Yi's proposal, fully resolve the overseas Chinese issue after consultation with our government. Huang Fukang, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Overseas Chinese and Deputy Manager of the Guangzhou South China Enterprise Company, said that our country has always regarded Indonesia as a friendly neighbor and treated the Indonesian people as our own brothers. When Indonesia is in difficulty, our government and people always try their best to give support and assistance. Our people believe that there is no fundamental conflict of interest between the Chinese and Indonesian people, but they are equally suffering from imperialist aggression and interference, and are equally facing the huge task of developing the economy and improving the people's living standards. The Chinese and Indonesian people have a thousand and ten thousand reasons to live in harmony, but not a single reason to be at odds with each other. The anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia can only benefit imperialism and a small handful of reactionaries in Indonesia, but are not conducive to the broad masses of the Indonesian people. Xie Xinzheng, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Overseas Chinese, and professor at Hubei University, said that the Indonesian reactionary forces disregarded the fact that overseas Chinese have long been breaking ground, reclaiming wasteland, running small businesses, and working hard. They slanderously accused the overseas Chinese economy as a "remnant of colonialist economy" in one go; regardless of the fact that the Chinese government and people have always supported and assisted Indonesia's national independence cause and respected Indonesia's sovereignty and independence, they viciously attacked China for "interfering in internal affairs." This cannot but arouse people's indignation. However, the conspiracy of the schemers to sow discord between China and Indonesia will never succeed.

Lin Xinquan and other nine representatives from Jiangxi Province said in a written statement that for more than a thousand years, overseas Chinese living in Indonesia have shared the fate and breath with the local people. They both struggled under the whip of Dutch colonialism, and every piece of land and every market town in Indonesia is stained with the blood and sweat of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people jointly reclaimed wasteland and prospered the local economy. If Indonesia really wants to make the Indonesian economy independent, it should take back the imperialist monopoly capital that controls the economic lifeline of Indonesia, and should not attack the overseas Chinese economy that is beneficial to the local area.

All the representatives from Beijing attending the meeting said in a written statement that the Chinese people, who have stood up, resolutely oppose any behavior that persecutes overseas Chinese and harms their legitimate rights and interests. Overseas Chinese are no longer orphans overseas, and a strong motherland is their reliance.

Zhang Guoji, representative of the National People's Congress and returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, Wang Jichen, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Overseas Chinese, Zheng Zhengren, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Overseas Chinese, Dong Yinchu, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Overseas Chinese, Chang Renxia, returned overseas Chinese from India, and other well-known returned overseas Chinese, also spoke at the meeting successively. They unanimously pointed out that the extremely vicious anti-Chinese activities of the Indonesian reactionary forces can only make those close to us grieve and those who hate us rejoice. Many facts in recent times have shown that the reactionary elements in Indonesia are introducing enemies while driving away friends of Indonesia. We should shout loudly to these reactionary elements: You are lifting a rock to drop it on your own feet. Wake up quickly! In order to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries and prevent those forces that are hostile to the friendship between the two countries from taking advantage of the situation, the Indonesian government should accept Foreign Minister Chen Yi's three proposals and hold negotiations as soon as possible to resolve the overseas Chinese issue.

    出席侨联会议代表寄语在印度尼西亚流离失所的侨胞
    欢迎海外亲人归来建设祖国
    侨乡代表表示将热情接待和安排亲友参加社会主义建设
    新华社上海13日电　出席中华全国归国华侨联合会一届四次全体委员（扩大）会议预备会议的归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生的代表们，深切关怀遭到极其粗暴和非人道待遇的印度尼西亚侨胞，热切希望流离失所或不愿继续留居印度尼西亚的侨胞返回祖国，参加祖国的伟大社会主义建设。
    全国二十多个省、市的归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生的代表们连日来都在预备会议的小组会上发言或向会议递交信件和书面发言，对印度尼西亚反动势力进行的疯狂的反华排华活动表示严重抗议，对在印度尼西亚侨胞的困难处境表示无限关怀。
    全国人民代表大会、全国侨联副主席庄明理说，我们伟大的祖国一贯热情地欢迎国外华侨回来参加伟大的社会主义建设事业。我们根据“一视同仁、适当照顾”的政策，十年来妥善安排了三十万归侨的工作和生活，仅为安排无家可归的归侨而设立的华侨农场就有几十个。这些农场的生产建设几年来有了很大发展，场员的生活水平也有了显著提高。许多归侨在党和政府的培养下，成为劳动模范和先进生产者，受到了广大人民的敬爱。现在，当印度尼西亚华侨受到了当地反动势力的惨无人道的欺凌与迫害的时候，祖国人民更加关心他们的生命财产的安全，更加热情地准备接待自己的侨胞返回祖国。
    全国人民代表大会代表、全国侨联副主席黄长水说，陈毅外交部长给印度尼西亚外交部长的信，不仅强烈地反映了中国人民维护两国友好关系的愿望，也再一次体现了祖国政府保护华侨正当权利和利益的立场。十年来，国家一贯执行了保护侨汇、存款的政策，并且颁布了华侨投资的优待办法，建立了华侨新村等。这一切，都是祖国政府对华侨深厚关怀的具体表现。旧中国时代华侨无依无靠、有国难归的时代早已一去不复返；如果还有人认为中国政府和六亿五千万中国人民还会坐视侨胞在海外遭受无端歧视和迫害，那就大错特错了。
    福建侨乡福清县副县长、印度尼西亚归侨高至荣说，福清县过去一穷二白，在反动统治下很多人流往海外，其中有不少人侨居在印度尼西亚。但是，现在的福清县已经完全变样了，尤其是公社化以后，工业总产值达到二千多万元，比1949年增长二十倍左右；兴建了东张水库，受益面积达三十一万亩，使当地摆脱了十年九旱的威胁。去年，已由缺粮县变为余粮县，今年晚稻又取得了大丰收。人民生活越过越好，再也没有人背井离乡出国谋生了。几年来，陆续回国的华侨都得到了政府的妥善安置。明年，福清县各项建设事业将会有更大的跃进。高至荣说，我代表福清县人民热烈欢迎流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿意继续在印度尼西亚留居的华侨回国回乡，和祖国人民一起建设祖国，建设家乡。
    广东大埔县代表范辉群说，我县侨居印度尼西亚的华侨很多，自从印度尼西亚采取排华措施以来，很多侨眷、归侨都在为亲人们的生命财产担忧，读了陈毅外长的信后，我们感到祖国无限温暖。他说，我们有中国共产党的领导，有无比优越的人民公社，我们的前途无限光明，我们希望国外亲人回来共同建设自己的家乡。
    广西代表、越南归侨周芳穗说，广西有专为归侨设立的华侨农场，这里气候温暖，适合华侨的生活习惯，完全能够发挥归侨的技术特长。我们欢迎华侨到广西来，和我们一起建设伟大的祖国。湖北天门县代表陈绍南等代表全省两万多侨眷归侨，欢迎自己的亲人回来。他们说，我们正在为华侨归来参加生产、工作和学习做好一切准备。六十多岁的印度尼西亚归侨、福建龙岩东华乡华侨果木场场长邓弥坚也表示了同样的愿望。三代侨居印度尼西亚的厦门市侨联主席、归侨颜西岳也表示热烈欢迎华侨回到祖国怀抱，建设伟大的祖国。广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校学生周绍文代表全校学生表示要做好归国华侨学生回来学习的一切准备工作。
    各地代表在发言中继续严重抗议印度尼西亚反动势力掀起的大规模的反华排华活动。他们要求印度尼西亚政府立即根据陈毅外交部长的建议，和我国政府经过协商全面解决华侨问题。广东省侨联委员、广州市华南企业公司副经理黄复康说，我国一向把印度尼西亚看成是友好的邻邦，把印度尼西亚人民当成自己的亲兄弟。当印度尼西亚有困难时，我国政府和人民总是尽力给以支持和帮助。我国人民认为：中国和印度尼西亚人民没有根本的利害冲突，却同样遭受着帝国主义的侵略和干涉，同样面临着发展经济、提高人民生活水平的巨大任务。中国印度尼西亚两国人民有一千个、一万个理由需要友好相处，而没有一个理由需要互相不和。印度尼西亚的反华排华活动，只能有利于帝国主义和印度尼西亚一小撮反动派，而不利于印度尼西亚广大人民。印度尼西亚归侨、湖北省侨联主席、湖北大学教授谢心正说，印度尼西亚反动势力不顾华侨长期以来披荆斩棘、开荒辟壤、小本经营、辛勤劳动的事实，一口诬蔑华侨经济是“殖民主义经济残余”；不顾中国政府和人民一贯支持和援助印度尼西亚民族独立事业、尊重印度尼西亚主权和独立的事实，恶毒攻击中国“干涉内政”，这不能不引起人们的愤慨。但是，阴谋分子挑拨中国和印度尼西亚友谊的阴谋终久是不会得逞的。
    江西省代表林信泉等九人在书面发言中说，一千多年来，侨居在印度尼西亚的华侨和当地人民共命运、共呼吸。他们同是在荷兰殖民主义的皮鞭下挣扎过，印度尼西亚的每一块土地，每一个集镇都流有华侨的血汗，华侨和印度尼西亚人民一道开垦荒地，繁荣当地经济。印度尼西亚真正要使印度尼西亚经济独立，就应该收回控制印度尼西亚经济命脉的帝国主义垄断资本，而不应该向有利于当地的华侨经济开刀。
    出席会议的北京市全体代表在书面发言中说，站立起来了的中国人民，坚决反对任何迫害华侨、危害华侨正当权益的行为。华侨已经不是海外孤儿，强大的祖国是他们的依靠。
    全国人民代表大会代表、印度尼西亚归侨张国基，山东省侨联主席王捷臣，天津市侨联副主席郑正仁，上海市侨联副主席董寅初，印度归侨常任侠等归侨知名人士，也先后在会上发言。他们一致指出：印度尼西亚反动势力穷凶极恶的排华活动，只能使亲者痛、仇者快。近来的许多事实表明：印度尼西亚的反动分子在赶走印度尼西亚的朋友的同时正在引进敌人。应当向这些反动分子大喝一声：你们自己正在搬起石头砸自己的脚，赶快醒一醒吧！为了维护两国的友好关系，使那些敌视两国友谊的势力无机可乘，印度尼西亚政府应当接受陈毅外交部长的三点建议，早日举行谈判解决华侨问题。
