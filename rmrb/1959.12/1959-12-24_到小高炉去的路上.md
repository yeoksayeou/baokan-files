　　On the Road to the Small Blast Furnace
　　Li Beigui
　　Everywhere are crisscrossing main roads, and each road looks different, making me feel like I'm trapped in Zhuge Liang's Eight Trigrams Formation. I turn around and around, going further and further in the wrong direction, my legs aching. Finally, I gave up and simply sat down by the roadside.

　　After a while, a tall young man with a cheerful expression, carrying a book, walked leisurely from the direction I had come. I quickly stood up, rushed over to intercept him, and asked, "Comrade, can you tell me which way to go to the iron smelting area?"

　　"To the small blast furnace? Let's go, we're going the same way!"

　　I quickly followed him, walking side by side.

　　"Actually, the small blast furnaces are easy to find, just look for the tall chimneys." The young man said as he walked, pointing to the front.

　　I looked in the direction he pointed and saw a row of tall chimneys standing not far ahead. However, I stubbornly shook my head.

　　"How could small native furnaces have such tall chimneys?" I asked him doubtfully.

　　"Is this your first time here?" He didn't directly answer my question.

　　"No! I came last year. During the Great Leap Forward, I even smelted iron at the small native furnaces here!" I acted like an old hand.

　　"No wonder, it's been a year!" Judging from his tone, it seemed like half a century had passed. "The changes are huge, something new every day, let alone a year! These roads didn't even exist three months ago!"

　　That was indeed true. Last year, when I participated in the Great Leap Forward here, I could walk straight to the small native furnaces along that only narrow path. If it weren't for these newly built spiderweb-like roads, I wouldn't have gotten lost. But no matter how big the changes, how could small native furnaces have tall chimneys!

　　"In January this year, the original small native furnaces all implemented the 'Five Fixes'. After that, all the small native furnaces here were rebuilt into small modern blast furnaces. Small modern furnaces use hot air and burn gas, how can they do without tall chimneys?" he explained.

　　To be honest, I've visited the large blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel and personally participated in iron smelting in small native furnaces, but I've never seen what small modern blast furnaces look like.

　　"How much ore is added per batch now?" I asked in an expert's tone.

　　"We use small batches, 150 kilograms of ore per batch."

　　"One hundred and fifty? Can people carry that?" I looked at him in surprise.

　　"Carry it? Why would we use people to carry it?" He looked at me in surprise as well. "We've been using hoists to load materials for a long time now, and the furnace top even has a double-bell charging system! No one is even needed on top of the furnace now!"

　　"Then what about the wind? Do you use hand-pulled bellows or foot-pedaled blowers?" I asked concernedly. Because last year, I was specifically responsible for pulling the bellows.

　　"Hand-pulled bellows? That won't do! We use motors! Now we achieve high-temperature and high-wind smelting. Several electric blowers are used in parallel for one furnace. How could hand-pulled bellows be enough?"

　　I laughed self-deprecatingly. Originally, my knowledge of iron smelting was very limited. I didn't dare to "teach my grandmother to suck eggs" anymore, so I quickly changed the subject:

　　"Are you going to work?"

　　"No, I'm going to a technical class." As he spoke, he handed me the book he was carrying under his arm.

　　I reached out and took it. It was a small booklet about small blast furnace gas technical operation. Suddenly, a few familiar small characters caught my eye: "Compiled by Hu Xiaowen."

　　"Hu Xiaowen, Hu Xiaowen..." I muttered.

　　"Do you know him?"

　　"The name sounds familiar..."

　　"He's now the furnace chief of the Red Flag Furnace." My companion tried to help me remember, "In the past, everyone called him 'Two Hands'..."

　　"Two Hands"? I remembered! Isn't that the chubby rural youth? During the Great Leap Forward, he had just come from the countryside. His home was in a remote mountain area. Having lived for twenty-one years, that time was the first time he had seen a real train. All day long, he had thousands of questions to pester me with, such as: Why don't cars burn coal, why can't electric lights be lit... Often making me unable to cope. When assigning tasks, he volunteered to sign up for loading materials. After the furnace started, he stared at that little alarm clock, loading a batch every now and then, filling the furnace with materials, almost freezing the furnace to death, and he himself was sweating profusely.

　　Everyone complained that he added too fast, saying, "You have to load materials on time, one batch every ten minutes!"

　　"I'm still loading one batch every twenty minutes! The clock is too fast, I can't keep up!" He hurriedly defended, pointing directly at the little alarm clock.

　　How could twenty minutes be so fast? Everyone was surprised and ran up to look at the clock. It turned out that he had mistaken the second hand for the minute hand. Everyone looked at him with a mixture of amusement and annoyance. He blushed and explained:

　　"In our village, there are only a few large clocks with two hands. This small clock with three hands is the first time I've seen it."

　　So his nickname "Two Hands" was given to him by everyone.

　　But how did this "Two Hands" start writing books? And it's still something about technical operation! The more I thought about it, the more puzzled I became.

　　"It's smelted out! The small blast furnace is not only for smelting iron, but also for training people!" My companion probably saw through my thoughts, and then narrated the whole story in detail:

　　In January this year, after the small native groups implemented the "Five Fixes", according to the plan, several small modern blast furnaces had to be built first. Building the furnaces was easy, as there were ready-made drawings, and construction could be done according to the drawings. The difficult thing was later on. The small modern furnaces were very different from the small native furnaces. The dust collector alone was as big as three or four small native furnaces, and it was necessary to recover gas and use hot air for smelting. From leaders to workers, no one knew how to deal with this kind of furnace. Later, it was decided to send Hu Xiaowen to a nearby large iron and steel plant to study. Although Hu Xiaowen only studied for a short seven days, due to his foundation in smelting small native furnaces, coupled with the enthusiastic help of the comrades at the iron and steel plant, he learned a lot, such as charging the furnace, batching materials, igniting... A whole set of materials was brought back.

　　After the furnace was ignited, it went very smoothly at first. Looking from the tuyere, the furnace was bright white and the temperature was very high. When it came to connecting the gas, Hu Xiaowen directed according to the method he had learned. As soon as he pulled the valve, there was a loud bang, and a cloud of light blue flames burst out of the dust collector, causing a gas explosion, and the dust collector was damaged. This start-up was not successful.

　　After the explosion, Hu Xiaowen's eyes were swollen from crying. The branch secretary went to him and said, "Don't be sad, the most important thing is to find the reason!" As soon as he heard this, he quickly went to look through the materials. It turned out that large modern blast furnaces used steam when connecting the gas, but small modern furnaces did not have steam. How to connect the gas without steam? Hu Xiaowen bought a lot of iron smelting books, but the books did not mention this method.

　　"'It's not in the books!'" He said to the secretary with a worried face.

　　"There are many things that aren't! The books didn't mention the mass campaign to develop iron and steel either!" the secretary said with a smile.

　　"What is steam used for? Why is it necessary? Find out the root cause, and the method will come out." The secretary reminded him again.

　　Hu Xiaowen's mind became much clearer, and he began to study again. Later, he discovered that gas and air mixed would explode, and steam was used to drive out the air because steam had pressure... If the gas pressure was increased, wouldn't it be able to drive out the air itself? His mind suddenly opened up, and he quickly reported this discovery to the secretary. With the support of the secretary, and after studying with many people for a long time, he finally developed a method without steam, and it was successful in the second start-up!

　　Soon, the secretary said to Hu Xiaowen: "Write it down, young man! Didn't you say it's not in the books? You write it into a book, and it will be in the books!"

　　"That's how this book was written!" My companion finished speaking and waved the booklet in front of me.

　　Unconsciously, we arrived at the small blast furnace. The first thing I saw was the mountain of iron blocks, and I exclaimed in surprise:

　　"So much... Did you smelt all of this?"

　　"Yes, the state has also transferred away quite a bit, adding up to more than five times this amount."

　　"Is the quality good?"

　　"Very good, it's all grade-one casting iron. Several thousand tons were transferred abroad in the past two months!" Then, he pointed to a blast furnace with a bright red flag flying on top and said, "That's the Red Flag Furnace, Hu Xiaowen is there!"

　　I looked in the direction he pointed, and just in time, the Red Flag Furnace was tapping iron. The rushing red-hot iron water and the red flag on top of the furnace reflected each other, it was extremely beautiful!

　　I parted ways with the young man and looked again at the flying red flag, thinking in my heart: After I finish my business, I must chat with Hu Xiaowen.

　　到小高炉去的路上
　　李北桂
    到处都是纵横交错的大马路，每一条马路又都是一个模样，弄得我就像陷入了诸葛亮摆的八阵图，转来转去，越走越不对，腿都跑疼了。最后，我泄气了，干脆一屁股坐在路旁。
    不一会，一个身材高大、神色愉快的小伙子，挟着一本书，不紧不慢地从我来的路上走来。我赶紧立起身，奔过去截住他，问道：“同志，请问到炼铁的地方去该往哪走？”
    “到小高炉去吗？走吧，我们同道！”
    我连忙跟上去，和他并肩走着。
    “其实，小高炉最好找，那些高大的烟囱就是。”小伙子一面走，一面说着，又用手往前方指了指。
    我顺着他的手势望去，发现前面不远的地方林立着一排高大烟囱。但是，我固执地摇了摇头。
    “小土炉哪有这么高的大烟囱？”我怀疑地望着他。
    “你是头一回来这里么？”他没有直接回答我的问题。
    “不！去年来过，大炼钢铁时，我还在这里的小土炉上炼过铁哩！”我摆起老资格来了。
    “难怪，一年了！”听他的口气，好像这一年足足有半个世纪那么久。“变化大呵，一天就一个样，何况一年！三个月以前还没有这些马路哩！”
    这话倒也真，去年，我在这儿参加大炼钢铁的时候，顺着那条唯一的羊肠小径，一直就可走到小土炉，要不是这些新修的蜘蛛网似的大马路，我也不会迷路了。可是，变化再大，小土炉怎会有大烟囱呵！
    “今年元月间，原来的小土炉都实行了‘五定’，在那以后，这儿的小土炉全都改建为小洋高炉了。小洋炉用热风，要烧煤气，没有大烟囱哪行呵？”他解释说。
    老实说，我参观过鞍钢的大高炉，也亲身参加过小土炉炼铁，至于小洋高炉是什么样我可没见过。
    “现在每批料加多少矿石？”我用行家的口吻询问着。
    “我们采用小料批，每批料一百五十公斤矿石。”
    “一百五？人能挑得动么？”我惊异地望着他。
    “人挑？为什么要用人挑？”他也惊异地望着我：“早就用卷扬机上料了，炉顶还是双料钟呢！炉子顶上现在一个人也不用！”
    “那么，风呢？是用手拉风箱还是脚踏风机？”我关心地问道。因为去年炼钢铁时，我是专门负责拉风箱的。
    “手拉风箱？那哪行？全用马达啦！现在实现高温大风，一座炉子还用好几台电动鼓风机并联使哩，手拉风箱怎能够用？”
    我解嘲地笑了笑。本来，我这点炼铁知识就非常有限，我不敢再“班门弄斧”了，赶忙把话题岔开：
    “你上班去么？”
    “不，去上技术课。”说着，他把腋下挟着的书本递给我看。
    我伸手接了过来，这是一本关于小高炉煤气技术操作的小册子，忽然，有几个熟悉的小字映入我的眼帘：“胡小文编”。
    “胡小文，胡小文……”我喃喃地说道。
    “你认识他么？”
    “名字好熟……”
    “他现在是红旗炉的炉长”，我的同伴努力在帮助我回忆，“过去，大家都叫他‘两根针’的……”
    “两根针”？我想起来了！不就是那个胖呼呼的农村青年么？大炼钢铁时，他刚从农村出来。他的家是在一个偏僻的山区里，活了二十一岁，那次出来，算是第一次看见了真的火车。一天到晚，他总有上千个问题要纠缠我，比如：汽车为什么不烧煤啦，电灯为什么点不着火啦……常常弄得我应接不暇。分配任务时，他自告奋勇报名上料。开炉以后，他瞅着那小闹钟，不一会儿上一批，不一会儿又上一批，把炉料装得满满的，险些把炉子冻死，他自己也累得满头大汗。
    大家抱怨他加得太快说：“你要按时上料呵，十分钟上一批料！”
    “我还是二十分钟上一批哩！钟太快了，忙不过来呵！”他急忙分辩说，还把手直指着那小闹钟。
    二十分钟哪有这样快？大家奇怪了，都跑上去看钟，原来，他把秒针当成分针了，大家又好气又好笑地望着他。他羞红了脸解释说：
    “我们村上，只有几个两根针的大钟，这三根针的小钟，我还是头一次看见哩。”
    于是他这个“两根针”的绰号就被大家叫开了。
    可是，这个“两根针”怎么写起书来了？而且还是什么技术操作！我越想越纳闷。
    “是炼出来的！小高炉不单是炼铁，而且还炼人呵！”我的同伴大概看穿了我的心思，便详细地叙述起原委来：
    今年元月，小土群实行“五定”以后，按规划，首先得修建几座小洋高炉。修炉子还好办，有现成的图纸，按图施工就是。难的事情在后头。小洋炉比起小土炉来大不一样，光是除尘器就有三四个小土炉大，还要回收煤气，用热风吹炼。从领导到工人，谁也不知道该怎么样对付这种炉子。后来，才决定派胡小文到附近大炼铁厂去学习，胡小文虽然只学了短短的七天，由于有了炼小土炉子的基础，再加上炼铁厂的同志们热心帮助，学得了不少东西，什么装炉呵，配料呵，点火呵……一整套资料都带回来了。
    炉子点火以后，一开始，倒很顺利，从风眼望去，炉子白亮白亮的，温度很高。到接煤气的时候了，胡小文按学来方法指挥着，把阀门一拉，不一会，只听见轰地一声巨响，一团淡蓝色的火焰从除尘器中涌出，发生了煤气爆炸，除尘器被炸坏了。这次开炉，也就没有成功。
    爆炸以后，胡小文把眼睛都哭肿了。支部书记走去对他说：“别难受，最要紧的是找原因！”他一听，赶快就去翻起资料来，原来，大洋高炉在接煤气时要用蒸气，而小洋炉却没有蒸汽。没有蒸汽怎样接煤气呢？胡小文买了一大堆炼铁书，结果，书上没有讲过这种方法。
    “‘书本上没有！’”他愁眉苦脸地对书记说。
    “没有的事多着哩！全民大办钢铁书上也没有！”书记笑着说。
    “蒸汽是干什么用的？为什么非要不可？把根源找清，方法也就出来了。”书记又提醒他。
    胡小文头脑清醒多了，又去钻研起来，后来，才发现煤气和空气混合就要爆炸，而蒸汽是用来赶空气的，因为蒸汽有压力……如果，把煤气的压力加大，它本身不是也可以赶空气么？他脑子豁然开朗起来，赶紧向书记汇报这个发现，在书记的支持下，又和许多人在一块研究很久，终于研究出了一套不用蒸汽的方法，在第二次开炉时一试验，成功了！
    不久，书记对胡小文说：“写吧，小伙子！你不是说书上没有吗？你把它写成一本书，书上就有了！”
    “就这样，这本书就写出来啦！”我的同伴说完，还把那小册子在我面前晃了晃。
    不知不觉间，到小高炉了，首先看见的就是那堆积如山的铁块，我惊奇地喊出声来：
    “这么多呵……都是你们炼的么？”
    “是的，国家还调走了好一些，加起来有这五倍多。”
    “质量好么？”
    “好得很，都是一级铸造铁，前两个月还调了好几千吨出国哩！”随着，他用手指着一座炉顶飘扬着鲜艳红旗的高炉说道：“那就是红旗炉，胡小文就在那！”
    我顺手望去，正好，红旗炉出铁了，那奔流着的赤红铁水，和炉顶那面红旗相映照，好看极了！
    我和那小伙子分了手，又望了望那面飘着的红旗，心里想道：办完了事，一定得找胡小文聊聊。
