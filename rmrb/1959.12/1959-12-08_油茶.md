Little Knowledge

    Camellia oil is one of China's main woody oil crops, distributed in provinces and regions such as Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Sichuan.

    The camellia tree is a perennial arbor, suitable for growing in mountainous areas, so it requires less management labor and does not compete with other crops for land or labor. A camellia tree can bear fruit for decades or even hundreds of years.

    Camellia trees bear fruit in the spring and ripen in the autumn. The oil extracted from the seeds is camellia oil. Camellia oil is a non-drying oil that can be eaten or used as an industrial oil. The oil cake left after oil extraction can be used as fertilizer.

    油茶
    油茶是我国主要木本油料之一，分布在湖南、广西、江西、浙江、福建、广东和四川等省（区）。
    油茶树是多年生的乔木，适宜在山区生长，因此管理用工较少，不和其他农作物争地争工。一棵茶树，能结几十年甚至上百年果实。
    油茶春季结实，秋季成熟。籽实榨出的油就是茶油。茶油属不干性油，可以吃用，也可以作某些工业用油。榨油剩下的渣饼可以作肥料。
