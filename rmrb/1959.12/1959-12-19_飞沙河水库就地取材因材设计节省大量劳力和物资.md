    Feisha River Reservoir Utilizes Local Materials and Tailored Design, Saving a Great Deal of Labor and Materials
    (Our report) The Feisha River Reservoir in Yingshan County, Hubei Province, in its construction process, has implemented the principle of relying on the masses and practicing diligence and thrift in water conservancy. From revising the design, reforming tools, and using local materials for self-reliance, it has saved a great deal of funds, equipment, and labor. Up to now, the materials saved at this construction site, such as cement, steel bars, and explosives, as well as labor and funds, could be used to build another reservoir of the same scale as the Feisha River.
    The Feisha River Reservoir is located on the upper reaches of the Shizi River, a tributary of the Huai River. It can store 41.6 million cubic meters of water and irrigate over 150,000 mu of farmland. It was originally one of the central government's Huai River control plan projects. Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, Yingshan County began to build this reservoir independently in 1958. At that time, there was a shortage of equipment and funds, but the people of Yingshan County, under the unified leadership of the County Party Committee, were full of enthusiasm and confidence and determined to build the reservoir well in order to eliminate the disaster of "nine droughts in ten years." The first phase of the project has now been completed, and the second phase has begun. The dam has been built to a height of 29 meters (designed height is 38 meters), completing more than 1.1 million cubic meters of earth and stone work.
    Under the leadership of the Yingshan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the construction site Party Committee first revised the dam design repeatedly, based on the principle of "using local materials and designing according to the materials." The major revisions included: changing the clay core wall soil-sand-stone combination dam to a clay core wall sand shell dam (the core of this type of dam is a layer of clay wall, the outer shell is sand, and the outermost shell is a riprap of gravel, pebbles, and flakes of stone). Feisha River has more sand and less soil. Making a sand shell dam and using a large amount of sand can save a great deal of stone, clay, and cement. This revision alone saved 800,000 units of labor, as well as a large amount of cement, steel bars and other equipment. Secondly, reducing the slope can save another 200,000 units of labor. In addition, raising the Feisha River Dam and not building the Huashan Dam originally designed for water storage saved more than 2 million units of labor. The sand shell dam built after the revision has been tested by this year's mountain floods, proving its good quality.
    Another measure taken by the construction site Party Committee of this reservoir to implement the policy of diligence and thrift in water conservancy was to rely on the masses to run small factories. The iron and wood processing plant, lime plant, and bamboo factory, etc., run by the construction site, have successively produced more than 7,600 handcarts, more than 1,000 wooden dump trucks, more than 17,000 meters of light wooden rails, and more than 9,000 kilograms of black explosives. The raw materials for making these tools and equipment were all solved through self-reliance.
    Now that the second phase of the project has started, a mass movement of everyone contributing ideas, everyone acting as a skilled craftsman, practicing diligence and thrift in water conservancy, and vigorously carrying out tool reforms has been formed. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, the laborers have crossed mountains and ridges to find substitutes, such as collecting vitex twigs to replace bamboo, finding old and waste wood to make carts, learning technology themselves, and making tools themselves.

### 飞沙河水库就地取材因材设计节省大量劳力和物资

    飞沙河水库就地取材因材设计节省大量劳力和物资
    本报讯　湖北应山县飞沙河水库在修建过程中，贯彻执行依靠群众、勤俭治水方针，从修改设计、改革工具和就地取材自修自造等方面，节约了大量资金、器材和劳力。到目前为止，这个工地已节约的水泥、钢筋、炸药等器材，以及劳力和资金，可以再修一个像飞沙河这样规模的水库。
    飞沙河水库位于淮河支流的狮子河上游，可蓄水四千一百六十万公方，灌溉农田十五万余亩，原属中央治淮计划工程之一。在总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年由应山县自建这座水库。当时器材、资金都很缺乏，但应山县人民为了消灭“十年九旱”的灾难，在县委的统一领导下，干劲十足，充满信心，一定要把水库修好。现在第一期工程已完成，第二期工程开始，大坝已修到二十九米高（设计高度三十八米），完成土、石方一百一十多万立方米。
    在中共应山县委领导下，工地党委首先根据“就地取材，因材设计”的原则，对大坝设计反复进行了修改。重大的修改有：把粘土心墙土沙石组合坝改为粘土心墙沙壳坝（这种坝的核心是一层粘土墙，外壳是沙，最外壳是瓜米石、卵石、片石砌的护坡）。飞沙河这里沙多土少，做沙壳坝大量用沙，就可节省大量的石头、粘土和水泥。仅这一项修改，就节约劳力八十万个，以及大批水泥、钢筋等器材。其次，削减坡度又可节省二十万个劳力。另外，加高飞沙河大坝，将原设计蓄水用的花山大坝不修，这一项又节省二百多万个劳力。修改后建起的沙壳坝，已经过今年山洪的考验，证明质量良好。
    这个水库工地党委贯彻勤俭治水方针的另一措施是：依靠群众自办小工厂。工地办的铁木加工厂、石灰厂、竹工厂等，先后生产了手推车七千六百多辆，木斗车一千多辆，轻便木轨一万七千多米，黑色炸药九千多公斤。制成这些工具、器材的原料，都是自力更生解决的。
    现在第二期工程已经开工，一个人人献计策，个个当巧匠，勤俭治水，大搞工具改革的群众运动已经形成了。为了解决原材料不足的困难，民工们翻山越岭广找代用品，例如采黄荆条代替竹子，找旧、废木料做车子，自己学技术，自己造工具。
