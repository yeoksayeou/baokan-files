The Zhang Youdao Youth Shock Brigade, which has maintained high efficiency on the Anhui water conservancy front for ten years, achieved an efficiency of 21.2 cubic meters on the first day of this winter's water conservancy construction. On this basis, all team members carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution, continued to adhere to tool reform, and constantly improved efficiency. From November 6 to December 3, their average daily efficiency per person reached 31.3 cubic meters of earthwork.

Recently, the members of the Zhang Youdao Youth Shock Brigade contributed ideas and worked together to further improve the original reformed advanced tools. For example, the簸箕式 (boji shi) skip, which has been improved thirty times, increased its daily efficiency from 40.2 cubic meters on the first day of construction to 51 cubic meters. Based on changes in the project, they also created three new sets of advanced tools, such as the monorail skip, and improved more than ten kinds of advanced tool collaborative construction methods. New tools were also used in the relatively weak construction links of loading and unloading. In order to give full play to the effectiveness of these advanced tools, the shock brigade members also launched a "skillful use of new tools" learning competition, adopting the method of assigning people to be responsible for tools, responsible for use, responsible for repair, and responsible for improvement, so that the work efficiency has been rising.

    张友道青年突击队再创新纪录
    日平均工效达三十一个土方
    十年来在安徽水利战线上一直保持高工效的张友道青年突击队，今冬兴修水利一开始，头一天工效就达到二十一点二立方米。在此基础上，全体队员发扬不断革命精神，继续坚持工具改革，不断提高工效。从11月6日到12月3日，他们每人每天平均工效已经达到了三十一点三个土方。
    张友道青年突击队的队员们最近大家献计，人人动手，对原来改革的先进工具，又作了进一步改进。例如已经经过三十次改进的簸箕式滑车，日工效又从开工第一天的四十点二立方米提高到五十一立方米。他们根据工程变化情况，又新创造了单轨滑车等三套先进工具，并且改进了十多种先进工具协作施工的方法，在装、卸等两道比较薄弱的施工环节也都使上了新式工具。为了充分发挥这些先进工具的效能，突击队员还开展了“巧使新工具”的学习竞赛，采用了定人包工具，包使包修包改进的办法，因而使工效一直上升。
