Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Jakarta: Amidst the current anti-Chinese tide in Indonesia, the military authorities in some parts of West Java have adopted various brutal methods, even openly using force to compel overseas Chinese to move out of areas below the county capital level, resulting in many tragic incidents of harming the personal safety and legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.

The bloody incident in the town of Cibatok is particularly representative. The large-scale forced eviction operation in West Java began here on November 3rd. On this day, the Sukabumi County military dispatched more than 100 armed personnel, including military police, local troops from Cibatok, and police, to force 12 local overseas Chinese families to abandon their property and move immediately. They besieged and beat overseas Chinese who complained about their difficulties. Overseas Chinese Fang Chengshan and Huang Shidun were severely beaten and injured, and even an elderly overseas Chinese woman who was blind and in her seventies or eighties was brutally knocked to the ground. Nine overseas Chinese families were forced to Sukabumi under armed coercion. Subsequently, the military authorities successively forced the remaining overseas Chinese to move. They adopted various intimidation tactics, such as searching overseas Chinese residences, monitoring overseas Chinese activities, prohibiting overseas Chinese from talking to each other in groups of two, and even sending out broadcasting vehicles for intimidating propaganda, creating an atmosphere of terror. On November 30th, armed military police even fired shots to intimidate the last group of overseas Chinese to leave Cibatok.

In fact, this kind of barbaric forced eviction behavior, which disregards justice and humanity, has spread throughout West Java. In some places, the military forced overseas Chinese to sign so-called "voluntary relocation" forms. For example, in Cianjur County, the military summoned overseas Chinese for a meeting, locked the doors, and had military police stand guard, forbidding overseas Chinese from speaking and forcing them to sign the eviction order, otherwise they would not be allowed to go home. In other places, they closed overseas Chinese shops, revoked overseas Chinese business licenses or car licenses, and coerced them to move. In still other places, the authorities threatened to take "military action," "tough measures," or "severe punishment under military law."

Threats were followed by violence to implement their forced eviction plans. In addition to the Cibatok incident, in Ciputat, Bandung County, when military police forced overseas Chinese to move on November 25th, overseas Chinese Li Yasen was startled and fell to the ground when the police fired a gun, and was later severely injured when he was violently thrown onto a truck. In Pagaden Baru, Subang County, on November 26th, when the forced eviction was underway, overseas Chinese Li Yutang asked for leniency and was slapped heavily in the face. In Cisarua, Bogor Regency, on the night of November 29th, the military carried out forced evictions, smashing the doors and windows of overseas Chinese residences and breaking the roof tiles.

On December 1st, when overseas Chinese were forcibly evicted in Ciramae, Jakarta Regency, in addition to the fact that 20 to 30 overseas Chinese were beaten and injured, the military police openly threatened, "Do you still remember the 1945 massacre of overseas Chinese? If you don't move, there will be a massacre." On the same day, in Ciramae Girang Town near Ciramae, when the authorities carried out forced evictions, overseas Chinese Xiao Lisheng was beaten all over his body with rubber batons by military police, and he fainted for two hours before regaining consciousness. Another overseas Chinese, Wu Yaoqiu, who was 58 years old, was injured in the left arm.

In some places, after overseas Chinese were forcibly taken away, the authorities continued to abuse and persecute them. In Subang County, at the end of November, the military imprisoned overseas Chinese brought in from various places in the hall of the Subang National Palace, guarded by military police, and prohibited them from entering or leaving. There was no water and no food was provided. The old and weak fell ill, and their lives were extremely miserable. In Purwakarta County, military police forcibly took overseas Chinese from Baleendah to Purwakarta, but did not solve the problem of their food and drink. That day it rained heavily, and the overseas Chinese were drenched in the rain and suffered from hunger and cold. Five people fell ill as a result, and their property was also severely damaged. Overseas Chinese Zhong Zhiping asked the military for food, but was punched by a soldier. Overseas Chinese in Ciroyom, Cirebon Regency, were forcibly evicted to a small village frequented by Islamic soldiers, concentrated in thatched huts, sleeping on the mud, and more and more people became ill. Many of the places where overseas Chinese were concentrated in Karawang County had no water source or toilets, and the authorities refused to solve these problems.

Facts show that the responsibility for these tragic incidents lies with the military authorities in charge of West Java. In some places, the responsible military officials openly clamored for violent and barbaric actions. Overseas Chinese who were imprisoned in Subang County had tried to run back to their original residences. The wartime controller of the county ordered them to be brought back, and shamelessly said, "Regardless of humanity, even if they are dead, they must be dragged back." The wartime controller of Karawang County publicly warned his subordinates that in the forced eviction, "Whoever beats people the most fiercely will be promoted, otherwise they will be demoted." There were also military officers who claimed to have "started their careers and been promoted by killing Chinese."

Taking such actions of forced eviction, attacks, and persecution against overseas Chinese who have made contributions to economic development in Indonesia in the past and who still play an active role in Indonesia's economic life is opposed and despised by the broad masses of the Indonesian people and just public opinion. They advocate resolving the issue of overseas Chinese in accordance with Indonesian President Sukarno's political manifesto and the Subandrio-Chen Yi Joint Communiqué, in the spirit of the Bandung Principles and the friendly spirit and interests of the two peoples.

### 西爪哇军方排华手段粗暴  蛮横殴打武力迫迁　损害华侨正当利益

    西爪哇军方排华手段粗暴
    蛮横殴打武力迫迁　损害华侨正当利益
    新华社13日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚目前掀起的排华逆流中，西爪哇一些地方的军事当局采取种种粗暴的手段，甚至公然使用武力，逼迫华侨迁离县首府以下地区，造成了许多伤害华侨人身安全、损害华侨正当权益的悲惨事件。
    在芝巴德镇发生的流血事件尤其具有代表性。西爪哇大规模迫迁行动是在11月3日从这里开始的。这一天，苏甲武眉县军方派遣宪兵会同芝巴德当地军队、警察等武装力量共一百多人，强迫当地十二户华侨立即抛弃财产迁移。他们围殴申诉困难的华侨。华侨方成山和黄世敦被毒打受伤，甚至一位双目失明、年已七、八十岁的老华侨妇女也惨被打倒在地。有九户华侨在武力强迫下被押往苏甲武眉。随后，军事当局又陆续迫迁其余华侨。他们采取种种恫吓手段，如搜查华侨住宅，监视华侨行动，不准华侨两人在一起谈话，还出动广播车进行恐吓宣传，制造一片恐怖气氛。到11月30日，武装军警为逼迫最后一批华侨迁离芝巴德竟然鸣枪示威。
    事实上，这种不顾公理人道的野蛮迫迁行为已经遍及西爪哇各地。在一些地方，军方强迫华侨在所谓“自愿迁移”的表格上签字，例如在展玉县，军方曾召集华侨开会，锁上大门，并由宪兵站岗，不准华侨发言，强迫他们在迫迁的命令书上签字，否则不准回家。在另外一些地方，他们封闭华侨店铺，吊销华侨商店执照或汽车执照，胁迫他们迁移。还有些地方，当局威胁要采取“军事行动”、“强硬措施”，或以“军法严惩”。
    威胁之后，继之以暴力来执行他们的迫迁计划。除了芝巴德事件以外，在文登县芝普塔特，11月25日军警迫迁华侨时，华侨李亚森因警察开枪受惊倒地，后来又被猛力摔上卡车因而受重伤。在苏横县伯加登峇鲁镇，11月26日在迫迁工作进行时，华侨李玉堂要求通融，被重击一巴掌。在茂物州新棠拉野，11月29日深夜军方实施强迫迁移，砸毁华侨住宅门户，击破屋瓦。
    12月1日在雅加达州芝拉马夜迫迁华侨时，除了有华侨二、三十人被殴伤外，当时军警还公然威胁说，“还记得1945年大屠杀华侨的事件吗？如果不搬，就大屠杀。”同一天，在芝拉马夜附近的芝拉马夜格朗镇，当局进行迫迁时，华侨萧利生被宪兵用橡胶棍打得遍体鳞伤，昏厥了两小时才苏醒，另一位年已五十八岁的华侨吴耀秋左臂被打受伤。
    在有些地方，华侨被强迫押走后，当局还继续加以虐待迫害。在苏横县，军方11月底把从各地押来的华侨监禁在苏横民族宫大厅内，由军警站岗，禁止出入。那里没有水，也不供给食物，老弱有的病倒，生活极为悲惨。在普哇加达县，军警用武力把不勒烈地方华侨押到普哇加达后，不解决华侨的饮食问题，而当天又遇大雨，华侨淋雨受凉，饥寒交迫，有五人因而病倒，他们的财产也受到严重损失。华侨钟志平向军方要求给予粮食，竟遭军人拳击。井里汶州芝日洛华侨被用武力逼迁到一个伊斯兰教军经常出没的小村庄里，集中住在茅棚里，睡在泥地上，生病者愈来愈多。加拉横县集中华侨的许多地方没有水源、厕所，而当局拒绝解决这些问题。
    事实表明，所发生的这些悲惨事件，责任都在于西爪哇负责的军事当局。在有些地方负责军事官员公然叫嚣采取暴力野蛮行动。苏横县被监禁的华侨曾有的设法跑回原居住地，这个县的战时掌权者下令把他们抓回来，并且无耻地说，“不管人道不人道，就是死人也要拉回来。”加拉横县战时掌权者当众警告属下士兵说，逼迁中“谁打人打得最凶，谁就升官，否则就降级”。还有军官自称是“以杀中国人起家升官的”。
    对于过去在印度尼西亚经济开发中曾经作出贡献、现在在印度尼西亚经济生活中仍然起着积极作用的华侨，采取这种武力迫迁、打击迫害的行动，是印度尼西亚广大人民和公正舆论所反对和鄙弃的。他们主张根据印度尼西亚总统苏加诺的政治宣言和苏班德里约—陈毅联合公报，本着万隆原则和两国人民的友好精神和利益来解决有关华侨的问题。
