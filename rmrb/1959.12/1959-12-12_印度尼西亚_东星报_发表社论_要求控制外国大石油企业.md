Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 11th: The Indonesian "East Star Newspaper" published an editorial today pointing out that the Indonesian government should control the foreign big oil enterprises in Indonesia and all their foreign exchange. Only by doing so can Indonesia improve its current economic situation.

It is reported that the Special Agreement on Foreign Exchange Permits for foreign oil companies will expire at the end of 1960. After the expiration of this agreement, these enterprises will be treated the same as Indonesian national enterprises, such as paying export duties.

The "East Star Newspaper" pointed out that if the government takes such measures, it would undoubtedly be a step forward. However, this measure is still inconsistent with Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution, which stipulates that production sectors and important resources related to national welfare and the people's livelihood should be controlled by the state.

The newspaper also said that foreign enterprises should not be allowed to enjoy the same treatment as national enterprises.

The newspaper also pointed out that in the debate on prohibiting foreign retailers in rural areas, some officials made inflammatory remarks in right-wing newspapers about eliminating "foreign capital" and protecting "national capital." Thus, it is even more necessary to discuss the status of foreign oil enterprises controlling Indonesia's important economic sectors in accordance with Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution.

The newspaper pointed out that it is worth noting that when some people were clamoring to ban foreign retailers, the Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, Mujado, told the press that this measure taken by the Indonesian government was welcomed by American official and non-official figures. He also said that Indonesia is in great need of foreign investment.

The newspaper pointed out, "This is ridiculous. On the one hand, there is agitation to eliminate 'foreign (Chinese) capital', while on the other hand, slogans are shouted to demand foreign (American) investment."

    印度尼西亚“东星报”发表社论
    要求控制外国大石油企业
    据新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚“东星报”今天发表社论指出，印度尼西亚政府应当控制在印度尼西亚的外国大石油企业和它们的全部外汇，只有这样做，印度尼西亚才能改善目前的经济状况。
    据报道，外国石油公司外汇许可特别协定将在1960年年底满期。在这个协定满期后，这些企业将受到同印度尼西亚的民族企业同样的待遇，例如它们也要缴出口税等。
    “东星报”指出，如果政府采取这样的措施，这无疑是一个进步。但是，这种措施无论如何还是同1945年宪法第三十三条不相符的，因为这项条款规定，有关国民福利和人民生计的生产部门与重要资源都应当受国家的控制。
    报纸又说，此外，不应当允许外国企业享有同民族企业一样的待遇。
    报纸还指出，在关于禁止乡村地区的外国零售商的争论中，有些官员在右翼报纸上就消灭“外国资本”，保护“民族资本”的问题发表煽动性的言论。这样，就更有必要根据1945年宪法第三十三条来讨论控制着印度尼西亚重要经济部门的外国石油企业的地位问题。
    报纸指出，值得注意的是，当有人大肆叫嚷要禁止外国零售商的时候，印度尼西亚驻美国大使慕加多向报界说，印度尼西亚政府采取的这种措施是受到美国官方和非官方人士的欢迎的，他又说，印度尼西亚非常需要外国投资。
    报纸指出，这是可笑的。一方面，在进行煽动要求消灭“外国（中国）资本，而另一方面，却高呼要求外国（美国）投资的口号”。
