    In the Border Area

  The Roots of Combat Friendship Run Deep

    On a dark day thirty years ago, on the road from Shuikou on the Sino-Vietnamese border to Cao Bang City, the capital of Cao Bang Province in northern Vietnam, a tall Vietnamese puppet soldier was escorting a young political prisoner, struggling to walk along the mountain road. At that time, Cao Bang Province, one of the birthplaces of the Vietnamese revolution, was at the height of White Terror, and the inspection of Communist Party members was very strict everywhere. It was common to see political prisoners being escorted from all parts of Cao Bang Province to Cao Bang City for imprisonment or execution. French military posts along the way were naturally very pleased to see the political prisoners being escorted; while the kind-hearted mountain people secretly shed tears of sympathy whenever they encountered these young communists who were generously facing danger.

    The tall puppet soldier took the young man into the city and, after turning a few corners, the young man was taken into a dark house...

    Thirty years later - in early November this year, I met one of these two men, Comrade Hong Qi, now the Secretary of the Cao Bang Provincial Party Committee. He and several other members of the current Cao Bang Provincial Party Committee were revolutionary comrades who were active in the border area between Vietnam and China at that time. They told me about their revolutionary activities at the time, about the unbreakable combat friendship that had been established between Vietnamese and Chinese revolutionary comrades as early as the underground period, and about the friendship between the people on both sides of the border for a long time.

    It turned out that the tall puppet soldier mentioned above was none other than Comrade Hong Qi, who had already joined the revolution. At that time, they sometimes used this bold method to transport the Party's secret documents and propaganda materials into Cao Bang City or other places in front of the enemy. The one who disguised himself as a political prisoner was an excellent member of the Indochinese Communist Party, who was unfortunately arrested by the enemy and heroically sacrificed himself later.

    During the White Terror, under the large-scale search and massacre by the French colonialists, Comrade Hoang Van Thu, one of the leaders of the Party in northern Vietnam at that time, had to temporarily move to Longjin County on the border of Guangxi Province. Comrade Hong Qi and Comrade Ru Lai, the current Director of the Cao Bang Provincial Public Security Bureau, were both liaison officers between Comrade Hoang Van Thu and the Cao Bang Provincial Party organization at that time. Walking swaggeringly on the highway was not a long-term solution, and it would be recognized sooner or later. Therefore, the liaison officers often took the narrow paths in the mountains. There, they often encountered gangs of bandits. Some of the bandits already knew what these young men who came and went in the mountains were doing. It was hard to guarantee that one day, for the sake of profit, they would not betray these young revolutionaries to French imperialism.

    The Party sent Comrade Hong Qi and several other young comrades to mix with the bandits.

    Gradually, Comrade Hong Qi and the others discovered that a considerable number of the bandits were kind farmers who sympathized with the revolution in the past. Because they could not stand on their feet in their hometowns under the cruel exploitation of the French colonialists, they were coerced by the bandit leaders to become bandits after they came out, and they themselves were unwilling to do this kind of dirty business. Comrade Hong Qi and the others carried out arduous revolutionary propaganda work among this group of people, and finally secretly organized them. At the same time, they also bought a batch of guns from other bandits and armed their own people. Relying on these forces, they gradually eliminated the worst bandits. In one battle, they eliminated more than 270 bandits equipped with machine guns and Mauser pistols. The revolutionary team only had土 guns and old rifles. After the strength gradually grew, they finally destroyed the bandit lair of Lin Dian, the bandit leader of Cao Bang Province, and annihilated all 700 of his men.

    Comrade Hong Qi said: "We miss Comrade Sheng Li, who is currently living in Shuikou, Guangxi. He is a white-haired Chinese revolutionary comrade. Thirty years ago, in order to protect us and provide us with a liaison station, he set up a 'Sheng Li Sewing Shop' in Shuikou. Although China was also in the White Terror period at that time, the Chinese comrades and kind people still took great risks to protect us and give us all the help they could." Comrade Hong Qi said: "Since the liberation of North Vietnam, we have sent people to visit Comrade Sheng Li every year, because the early combat friendship is unforgettable."

      The People of the Two Countries Are Like One Family

    Whether in Cao Bang Province or Lang Son Province, I heard the comrades of the Provincial Party Committee say that the people on both sides of the Sino-Vietnamese border have always had very close relations. The ethnic groups in the Vietnamese border area are mostly the Tày and Nùng. They are of the same origin as the Zhuang in Guangxi. It is said that the Tày migrated to Vietnam earlier from China, and have had more contact with the Kinh, the main ethnic group in Vietnam, so their living habits are more influenced by the Kinh. The Nùng migrated to Vietnam later from China, and their living habits are closer to the Zhuang. The Tày and Nùng can communicate with the Zhuang in Guangxi in their languages. Residents on both sides of the border have long maintained marriage and kinship relations. At present, there are still some cross-border villages on the border. For example, there are two such villages in Cao Bang Province, half in Cao Bang Province, Vietnam, and half in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. The people of the two countries are actually the people of one village, and they meet every day. During the French and Kuomintang rule, the boundary lines were unclear in some places on the border, and the rulers of the two countries were also confused about which country some villages belonged to. The local border residents took advantage of this situation. When the French conscripted soldiers, they placed the boundary marker on the south side of the village, and when the Kuomintang conscripted soldiers, they moved the boundary marker to the north side of the village. Before last year, there were still many cross-border fields. Since last year, they have been gradually adjusted to each other. Since the liberation of North Vietnam, the border residents of Vietnam and China have often crossed the border to graze cattle and collect firewood. Vietnamese border residents often cross the border to sell local products and buy daily necessities from China. Recently, when people in Vietnam are sick, if they are far away from their own medical station, they often go to the clinic of the People's Commune in China to see a doctor. In the past, the agricultural production cooperatives on both sides often organized visits to each other to exchange experiences.

      Visiting Relatives at Dongning Agricultural Cooperative

    The People's Commune movement on our border and the agricultural cooperativization movement on the Vietnamese border are encouraging each other. Comrade Zong, Deputy Secretary of the Cao Bang Provincial Party Committee, said that wherever the People's Commune on the other side of the border is doing better, the agricultural cooperativization movement on this side of the border is also doing better. For example, the Shuikou People's Commune in Guangxi is doing very well, and the Dongning Agricultural Production Cooperative on the opposite side of the commune is doing well.

    We decided to visit the Dongning Agricultural Production Cooperative; at the same time, we went to visit the Shuikou People's Commune in China with several Vietnamese comrades. Since the establishment of the Shuikou People's Commune, comrades from Cao Bang Province have often visited there.

    We first came to the county seat of Phuc Hoa County, where the Dongning Cooperative is located. This is a town of more than 60 households, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with very beautiful scenery. On the hillside of the County Committee, there are rows of tall, unknown flowers that look like cockscomb flowers. One flower tree has countless stamens, which look like piles of flames from a distance. A fellow comrade said, why not call it "Flame Flower".

    When we arrived at the Dongning Cooperative, it happened that the director of the cooperative was not at home, so the cooperative members Le Duc Hung, Li Yun Gong and the production team leader Li Wang Min received us. Li Wangmin was in Guangxi before liberation and joined the Guangxi guerrillas in 1947. He returned to Cao Bang in 1953. According to them, Dongning Cooperative has 54 households and 285 people, all of whom are Nùng. They mainly grow rice and sugarcane, and also grow corn and soybeans. This autumn, they had a bumper harvest. On average, each person has 500 kilograms of dried grain and corn, more than 100 kilograms of brown sugar and 35 kilograms of soybeans. The cooperative has 82 cattle and 155 pigs. The net income per person is about 400 yuan in Chinese currency. Everyone made three or four sets of clothes this year. No one in the cooperative wears ragged clothes anymore. The life of every family here is equivalent to the level of county-level cadres. Before liberation, nearly half of the current members were poor peasants. Agricultural cooperativization has turned this poor village into a rich village.

    They said that Dongning Cooperative and Shuikou People's Commune have very close relations, and there are also kinship relations between the two cooperatives.

      Watching Flowers at Shuikou People's Commune

    Leaving Dongning Township, we came to a river, which the locals call "Beiwang River". The origin of this name is unknown, but there is evidence that it symbolizes the love of the people on the Vietnamese border for the people on the Chinese border north of the river. Before the liberation of the two countries, the revolutionary of both sides did not know how many times they crossed this river. After liberation, it became one of the channels for Guangxi to exchange materials with the mountainous areas of North Vietnam.

    There is a highway iron bridge on the Beiwang River called Shuikou Bridge. This is the second largest passage between China and Vietnam after Friendship Pass. After walking a few hundred steps across the iron bridge, we came to the Shuikou People's Commune. Duan Shuxiang, Secretary of the Longjin County Party Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and County Mayor Li Di and other comrades came to the bridge to welcome our group of Vietnamese and Chinese guests from Vietnam.

    Shuikou People's Commune is also surrounded by mountains and rivers, and the scenery is no different from that in northern Vietnam. Except for the clothing and women's hairstyles, the people are no different in appearance from the people south of the river. The commune covers an area of 60 miles long and 20 miles wide. In addition to growing rice and corn, there are also large banana groves on the hillside, interspersed with pineapples, coffee and papayas. The small coffee trees, which were just planted not long ago, were already full of fruits, which surprised the Vietnamese comrades who are famous for producing coffee. The commune was originally a poor commune, and the fields were originally dry land. After building water conservancy and highways, the dry land has been turned into paddy fields. The highway leads directly to eight of the ten production teams. The commune has also built many neat and beautiful houses. The water-powered machine mill built next to a small canal aroused great interest among the guests. This soil machine, which was made by the commune itself and is mostly made of wood, can grind more than 1,500 kilograms of corn flour every day. Although the quick visit lasted less than two hours, it left a deep impression on people.

    On the way back to Cao Bang, Comrade Ru Lai told reporters many stories about the friendship of the border people and the revolutionary struggle during the underground period. The story of the puppet soldier escorting political prisoners was told by him. Our car was running on the highway where the puppet soldier had escorted political prisoners. But now this is no longer the world of imperialism. The mountain people here - under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, are advancing bravely on the road of socialist construction.

    在边界地方
    本报记者　韦真
  战斗友谊根源深
    在三十年前的一个阴暗的日子里，从中越边界的水口到越北高平省省会高平市的途中，有一个高个子的越南伪军押解着一名青年政治犯，在丛山峻岭的公路上吃力地走着。当时，作为越南革命发源地之一的高平省，正是白色恐怖的高潮时期，各地盘查共产党员非常严密。从高平省各地押解政治犯到高平市去入狱或枪决的，经常都可以看到。沿途法军岗哨见到押解政治犯，当然非常得意；而善良的山区老百姓每逢遇到这些慷慨赴难的青年共产主义者的时候，总是暗地流下了同情的眼泪。
    高个子伪军把青年押进了市区，转了几个弯之后，青年被押进了一间黑房子里……。
    三十年后的一天——今年11月初，记者遇见了这两个人中间的一位，他是现在高平省省委书记红旗同志。他和好几位目前高平省委的委员，都是当时活动在越中两国边界地区的革命同志。他们向记者讲述了当时他们的革命活动情况，讲到了越中两国革命同志之间早在地下时期就已建立的牢不可破的战斗友谊，也讲到了长期以来边界双方人民之间的友谊。
    原来，上边讲的那位高个子伪军并不是别人，而是早就参加革命的红旗同志。当时他们有时就是采用这种大胆的办法，把党的秘密文件和宣传品，在敌人的面前大摇大摆地运进了高平市或别的地点。那位装扮政治犯的，是一位优秀的印度支那共产党党员，他在后来不幸被敌人逮捕而英勇地牺牲了。
    在白色恐怖时期，在法国殖民者大肆搜捕和屠杀的情况下，当时越北党的领导人之一黄文树同志不得不暂时迁到广西省边界的龙津县去。红旗同志和现任高平省公安局长如来同志都是当时黄文树同志同高平省党组织之间的联络员。在公路上大摇大摆地走并非长久之计，日久一定会被识破。因此，联络员常走的道路还是丛山峻岭中的羊肠小道。在那里，他们又常碰到成股的土匪。土匪中有的人早已知道这些来往于山间的小伙子是干什么的。难保他们不会突然有一天，由于唯利是图的原因，把这些青年革命者出卖给法帝国主义。
    党派红旗同志和另外几位青年同志同土匪混在一起。
    逐渐地，红旗同志他们发现，在土匪中有相当一部分人，过去是同情革命的善良农民，因为在法国殖民者残酷剥削之下，在家乡立不住脚，出来之后被匪首胁迫去当土匪，他们本身是不情愿干这种黑买卖的。红旗同志他们就在这部分人中进行艰巨的革命宣传工作，终于把他们秘密地组织起来。同时，还陆续从其他股匪那里买来一批枪枝武装了自己的人。依靠这些力量，逐股地消灭了那些最坏的土匪，其中一役，消灭了有机枪和匣子枪装备的土匪二百七十多人。而革命队伍方面却只有土枪和旧步枪。在力量逐步壮大之后，最后捣毁了高平省匪首林奠的匪窠，全歼所部七百人。
    红旗同志说：“我们非常怀念目前还住在广西水口的一位白发苍苍的生利同志。他是中国的革命同志。三十年前为了掩护我们，同时给我们作联络站，曾经在水口设立一家‘生利缝衣店’。当时中国虽然也是在白色恐怖时期，中国的同志和善良的人民还是冒着极大危险来掩护我们，给予我们各种能够做到的帮助。”红旗同志说：“北越解放以来，我们每年都派人去看望生利同志，因为早期的战斗友谊是令人难忘的。”
      两国人如同一家人
    无论在高平省或谅山省，记者都听到省委同志说，中越边界两边的人民，关系一向是很密切的。边界越南境内的民族，最多的是齐族和侬族。他们同广西的僮族同出一系。据说齐族从中国迁来越南较早，同越南的主要民族京族接触较久，生活习惯上受京族影响较多。侬族是后来从中国迁来越南的，生活习惯上比较更接近僮族。齐族和侬族，同广西僮族之间，语言都能够相通。边界两边的居民，长久以来保持通婚和亲戚关系。目前边界上还有一些跨国界的乡村，例如高平省就有两个这样的村子，一半在越南高平省境内，一半在中国的广西僮族自治区境内。那里两国的人实际上就是一村的人，天天见面。法国和国民党统治时期，边界有的地方界线不明确，两国的统治者对于有些村子属哪国管也搞不清。当地边民利用了这种情况，在法国人抓兵时，把界碑放在村南边，而当国民党抓兵时就把界碑移到村北边。去年以前，跨国界的田地还不少，去年以来，已逐渐互相进行了调剂。越南北方解放以来，越中双方边民仍经常互相过境放牛、打柴。越南边民常过境去卖土产，从中国买回日用工业品。近来，越南境内的人生病时，如果离自己的医务站较远，就常常到中国境内的人民公社医务所去看病。过去两边的农业生产合作社还经常互相组织参观，交换经验。
      东宁农业社探亲
    我国边境的人民公社运动和越南边境的农业合作化运动起着互相鼓舞的作用。高平省委副书记宗同志说，凡是边境那边人民公社搞得比较好的地方，边境这边的农业合作化运动也就搞得较好。例如广西水口人民公社搞得很好，同公社相对面的这边的一个东宁农业生产合作社就搞得不错。
    我们决定去参观东宁农业生产合作社；同时，同几位越南同志到中国境内参观水口人民公社。自水口人民公社成立以来，高平省常有同志到那边去参观。
    我们先来到东宁合作社所在的复和县县城。这里是一个六十多户的镇子，依山傍水，风景十分秀丽。在县委会的山坡上，长着一排排高大的好像鸡冠花一样的不知名的花，一棵花树上有着无数的花蕊，远看宛如一堆堆的火焰。一位同行的同志说，不妨把它叫做“火焰花”。
    来到了东宁合作社，正巧社主任不在家，就由社委员黎德兴、李云公和生产队长李王民接见了我们。李王民解放前在广西，1947年参加过广西游击队。1953年回到高平。据他们介绍：东宁社有五十四户，二百八十五人，都是侬族。主要种稻子和甘蔗，兼种玉米和黄豆。今年秋季遇到了特大丰收，按人口平均每人有五百公斤干谷和玉米、一百多斤红糖和三十五斤黄豆。全社有八十二头牛、一百五十五头猪。每人纯收入约合中国人民币四百多元。今年每人都做三、四套衣服。全社再没有一人穿破衣服。这里每家老百姓的生活，都相当于县级干部的水平。而解放以前，目前的社员有近一半是贫农。农业合作化使这个穷乡变成了富乡。
    他们说，东宁社和水口人民公社的关系很密切，两社之间还有亲戚关系。
      水口人民公社观花
    走出东宁乡，我们来到了一条河边，当地人把它叫做“北望河”，这名字的来历已经无从考核，但是有根据认为它正象征着越南边界人民对河北岸中国边界人民的友爱的心情。就在这条河上，两国解放之前不知涉过了多少双方的革命者。解放之后，它又成了广西同越北山区交流物资的通道之一。
    北望河上有一道公路铁桥叫水口桥，这里是中国同越南之间仅次于睦南关的通道。走过几百步的铁桥就来到水口人民公社。广西僮族自治区龙津县县委书记段书香和县长李地同志等来到桥头迎接我们这一批从越南来的越中两国客人。
    水口人民公社也是依山傍水，景色同越北没有两样。社员除了服装和妇女的发式之外，同河南岸的人民样子也没有区别。公社面积长六十里，宽二十里，除种稻子和玉米之外，山坡上还种了大片的芭蕉林，林中夹种了菠萝、咖啡和木瓜。刚种不久的半人高的小咖啡树上已经果实累累，盛产咖啡的越南的同志们看了也觉得惊讶。公社原是贫社，田地原是旱田，经过大修水利和公路之后，旱田都变成了水田。公路直通十个大队中的八个大队。公社还盖了许多整齐漂亮的房子。在一条小渠边建立的水力机器磨坊，引起了客人们很大的兴趣，这部公社自己制造的、大部用木头构成的土机器，每天能磨出玉米粉一千五百多斤。虽然走马观花看了不到两小时，却留给了人们深刻的印象。
    在回高平的途中，如来同志在汽车上向记者讲述了许多关于边界人民友谊和地下时期的革命斗争故事。前边那个伪军押政治犯的故事就是他讲的。我们的汽车正在那位伪军押解过政治犯的公路上奔驰。可是此时此地已经不是帝国主义的天下，这里的山区人民——正在越南劳动党的领导下，在社会主义建设的道路上勇猛前进。（附图片）
