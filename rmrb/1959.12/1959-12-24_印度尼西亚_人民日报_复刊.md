　　Indonesian "People's Daily" Resumes Publication
    Jakarta News: The Indonesian "People's Daily" resumed publication on the 23rd.
    This newspaper was ordered to cease publication by the Jakarta military authorities on December 9th. When announcing the ban on the 8th, a spokesman for the Jakarta Garrison Command said that the newspaper was prohibited from publishing because it published a report by the Second Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, Yudo, on his impressions of his visit to China on November 24th. In an editorial published on the 23rd, the "People's Daily" expressed its gratitude to those who supported and sympathized with it during its suspension. The newspaper also stated that it would not stop defending the interests of the people for fear of being banned.

　　印度尼西亚“人民日报”复刊
    本报讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚“人民日报”在23日复刊。
    这家报纸是在12月9日被雅加达军事当局下令停刊的。雅加达卫戍司令部发言人在8日宣布这项禁令时说，这家报纸被禁止出版，是由于它在11月24日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第二副主席约多所作的关于访华观感的报告。“人民日报”在23日发表的社论中，对那些在它停刊期间支持和同情它的人表示感谢。报纸还表示，不可能因为害怕被禁止就不再捍卫人民的利益。
