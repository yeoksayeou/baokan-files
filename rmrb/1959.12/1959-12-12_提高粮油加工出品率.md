Increase Grain and Oil Processing Output Rate
By Our Staff Commentator

The situation in this autumn's grain and oil procurement work is extremely good: grain procurement tasks have been completed in many areas, and the progress of oil procurement is also very rapid. Grain and oil are necessities for people's lives and important raw materials for industry. However, grain and oil must be processed before they can be supplied for people's consumption and production construction. Therefore, after the procurement work, the grain and oil processing work must keep up closely to quickly process raw grains into finished grains and oil crops into oils.

In the process of processing raw grains and oil crops, a very important issue is to increase the output rate of grain and oil. That is to say, how to process more rice, flour, miscellaneous grains, and oils from the same amount of raw grains and oil crops. Increasing the output rate of grain and oil processing is an important measure to increase grain and oil production, but this issue has not received universal and sufficient attention from grain and oil processing enterprises. Some people regard processing a few more pounds of grain or oil from every hundred pounds of raw grain or oil crop as a trivial matter. Others believe that the current grain and oil output rate has reached its peak, and there is no more potential to be tapped. These views are incorrect. We only need to cite two examples to see that there is still much to be gained in increasing the grain and oil output rate. After the rural people's communes in Qingjiang County, Jiangxi Province, reformed grain processing tools, every hundred pounds of rice could produce seven more pounds of rice, and the entire county could increase rice production by 10.5 million pounds a year. According to calculations in Shaanxi Province, if the oil yield of oil crops processed by machine and native presses throughout the province increases by an average of two pounds per hundred pounds (which is entirely possible), then the province can increase oil production by more than 13 million pounds in the 1959-1960 production year, equivalent to the oil production of more than 750,000 mu of rapeseed. Can such a large increase in production be said to be a trivial matter? Of course not.

It is entirely possible to increase the output rate of grain and oil, based on the fact that the grain and oil output rates vary greatly from place to place. For example, the difference between the highest and lowest average oil yield per hundred pounds of rapeseed is as much as fourteen pounds, peanuts more than eleven pounds, soybeans more than seven pounds, and sesame more than eight pounds. The difference between the highest and lowest amount of rice produced per hundred pounds of paddy rice is more than seventeen pounds, and the difference in the amount of flour produced per hundred pounds of wheat is also more than twelve pounds. From this, it can be seen that as long as measures are taken to eliminate or narrow this gap in output rate, and the grain and oil output rate is generally raised to an advanced level, then the country can increase the production of a large amount of grain and oil every year. Moreover, even in advanced grain and oil processing enterprises, the current increase in output rate has not yet reached its peak, and there is still considerable potential. Of course, the processing output rate of grain and oil is not unlimited, but, according to the current situation, the output rate of grain and oil is by no means already at its peak. On this issue, we must never adopt a complacent and conservative attitude, but should take the attitude of "fighting for every ounce, fighting for every drop," and do everything possible to tap processing potential and increase the production of more grain and oil.

How can we increase the output rate of grain and oil? The key lies in launching mass movements and firmly grasping the link of technological innovation. Technological innovation is the most effective method to increase the output rate and increase production. Take the Jinyun Oil Factory in Zhejiang Province as an example: this factory has launched a mass technological innovation movement since the spring of this year, making its own equipment and using water power as power, realizing the mechanization of the entire production process from oilseed dehulling to crushing, heating, screening, and loading the press, which greatly improved labor efficiency. The daily output increased from 3,800 pounds in the past to more than 8,000 pounds. The oil yield has also been greatly improved, from 35 pounds of oil per hundred pounds of rapeseed in the past to 41 pounds, with a maximum of 44.8 pounds. With the development of the technological innovation movement, this factory has completed this year's production tasks more than three months ahead of schedule. Although Jinyun Oil Factory is only one example, it fully illustrates the importance of carrying out technological innovation in increasing output rate and increasing production. All grain and oil processing enterprises should also pay close attention to promoting advanced experience. At present, grain and oil processing enterprises in various places have created many advanced experiences in improving output rate, increasing production, and other aspects, such as the wheat processing peeling and flouring method, the front-end flouring method, the simultaneous flouring of skin grinding and core grinding. In terms of oil processing, there are methods of high-moisture steaming and low-moisture pressing for machine pressing to increase oil yield, methods of lengthening the body and increasing the pressing chamber to increase production, and methods of fly hammers, drop hammers, intermediate pressing, and single-circle grass-bag-free cakes for native pressing to increase oil yield and production. For these advanced experiences, each processing enterprise can adopt and promote them according to its own conditions, in order to increase production and quality as soon as possible.

While increasing the output rate of grain and oil processing, we should also make full use of existing processing equipment to increase the production of grain and oil. The utilization rate of existing processing equipment is still not high. For example, the equipment utilization rate of flour mills is only 73%, the equipment utilization rate of machine oil mills is only 75%, and the equipment utilization rate of rural native oil mills is only about 50%. This shows that as long as the efficiency of equipment is fully utilized and the production capacity of equipment is further improved, the production of grain and oil can be greatly increased.

Increasing output rate and yield, increasing grain and oil production, is not only a matter for state-owned or local state-owned grain and oil processing enterprises, but also an important task for rural people's commune grain and oil processing units. This is not only because a part of the grain and nearly half of the oil currently operated by the state still rely on the native mills and native presses of the people's communes for processing, thus requiring the grain and oil processing units of the people's communes to increase the output rate and yield of grain and oil. More importantly, the amount of grain consumed annually nationwide is much larger in rural areas than in cities, and the amount of oil consumed also accounts for a large proportion. Therefore, increasing the output rate of grain and oil processing and increasing the production of grain and oil in rural areas is of great significance. In order to help the grain and oil processing units of the people's communes to increase the output rate and yield, state-owned, especially local state-owned, grain and oil processing enterprises should actively provide technical guidance, help train technicians, and reform tools. At present, the leading departments of grain and oil processing should also strengthen cooperation with commercial and other relevant departments, organize various processing enterprises to exchange experiences, summarize and promote new experiences in a timely manner, and at the same time help solve some practical difficulties, so as to promote the continuous progress of work.

Now, a peak season for grain and oil processing has arrived. We believe that the comrades and workers of grain and oil processing enterprises across the country will certainly be able to muster soaring energy, vigorously carry out technological innovation, and outstandingly complete the task of grain and oil processing, so as to increase the production of more finished grain and oil for the country.

    提高粮油加工出品率
    本报评论员
    今年秋季粮食、油料征购工作的形势极为良好：粮食征购任务在许多地区已经完成，油料的征购进度也非常迅速。粮、油是人民生活的必需品，同时又是工业的重要原料；但是，粮食和油料必须经过加工，才能供应人民消费和生产建设的需要。因此，在收购工作之后，粮食和油料的加工工作必须紧紧跟上，迅速把原粮加工成成品粮，把油料加工成油脂。
    在原粮和油料加工过程中，一个很重要的问题是提高粮油出品率，这就是说，怎样用同样数量的原粮和油料，加工出更多的大米、面粉、杂粮和油脂。提高粮油加工的出品率，是增产粮油的一项重要措施，但这个问题还没有引起粮油加工企业普遍的和足够的重视。有人把从每百斤原粮或油料中多加工出几斤粮食或油脂看作是微不足道的小事，也有人认为目前粮油出品率已经到顶，再没有甚么潜力可挖了。这些看法都是不对的。我们只举两个例子，就可看出提高粮油出品率还是大有可为的。江西省清江县农村人民公社改革粮食加工工具以后，每百斤稻谷可以多出大米七斤，全县一年可以增加大米一千零五十万斤。根据陕西省的计算，全省经过机榨、土榨的油料，如果每一百斤平均提高出油率二斤（这是完全可能的），那么1959—1960年这一生产年度，全省就可以增产油脂一千三百多万斤，相当于七十五万多亩油菜籽的产油量。能说这样大的增产是小事吗？当然不能。
    提高粮食和油料出品率是完全可能的，根据是目前各地粮油出品率的悬殊很大，例如每百斤菜籽平均出油量最高与最低相差十四斤之多，花生相差十一斤多，大豆相差七斤多，芝麻相差八斤；每百斤稻谷出大米的数量，最高与最低相差十七斤多，每百斤小麦出面粉的数量也相差十二斤多。由此可以看出，只要采取措施消灭或是缩短这种出品率悬殊的差距，把粮油出品率普遍提高到先进的水平，那末每年就能够为国家增产大量的粮食和油脂。况且，就是在先进的粮油加工企业中，目前出品率的提高也还没有到顶，潜力还有不少。当然，粮食和油料的加工出品率并不是无限的，但是，根据目前情况看来，粮食和油料的出品率也绝不是已经到顶了，在这个问题上绝不能采取自满自足的保守态度，而应该以“斤两必争、点滴必争”的态度，千方百计地挖掘加工潜力，增产更多的粮食和油脂。
    怎样才能提高粮食和油脂的出品率？关键在于大搞群众运动，紧紧抓住技术革新这一环节。技术革新是提高出品率和增加产量的最有效的方法。以浙江省缙云油厂为例：这个厂从今年春天就开展了群众性的技术革新运动，自制设备，利用水力作动力，实现了从油料脱壳到碾碎、炒热、筛选、上车撞榨等全部生产过程机械化，大大提高了劳动效率。
  日产量由过去的三千八百斤提高到八千多斤。出油率也大大提高，每一百斤菜籽由过去出油三十五斤提高到四十一斤，最高达到四十四点八斤。随着技术革新运动的开展，这个厂已经提前三个多月超额完成了今年生产任务。缙云油厂虽然只是一个例子，但它充分地说明了开展技术革新对于提高出品率和增加产量的重要意义。所有粮油加工企业，也应该十分注意推广先进经验。目前各地粮油加工企业都创造出不少的提高出品率、提高产量以及其他方面的先进经验，如小麦加工的剥皮制粉法、前路出粉法、皮磨心磨并重出粉法，在油料加工方面，有高水分蒸?、低水分压榨的机榨提高出油率的方法，加长机身、加大榨膛的提高产量的方法，有飞锤、吊锤、中间打榨、单圈无草包饼的土榨提高出油率和产量的方法，等等。对于这些先进经验，各个加工企业可以根据本身条件加以采用推广，以便尽速提高产量和质量。
    在提高粮油加工出品率的同时，还应当充分利用现有的加工设备。增加粮食和油脂的产量。现有加工设备的利用率还是不算高的，如面粉加工厂设备利用率仅为73％，机榨油厂设备利用率只达到75％，农村土榨油厂设备利用率只达到50％左右。这就说明，只要充分发挥设备效能，进一步提高设备生产能力，粮食和油脂的产量就能够大大增加。
    提高出品率和产量，增产粮食和油脂，不只是国营或地方国营粮油加工企业的事情，也是农村人民公社粮油加工单位的重要课题。这不仅因为目前国家经营的粮食和油脂中有一部分粮食和近一半的油料还依靠人民公社的土磨、土榨进行加工，因而要求人民公社粮油加工单位提高粮油出品率和产量，更重要的原因是，全国每年粮食的消费数量，农村要比城市大得多，油脂的消费量也占很大比重，因此，提高农村粮油加工出品率和增产粮食和油脂，有着非常重要的意义。为了帮助人民公社粮油加工单位提高出品率和产量，国营特别是地方国营粮油加工企业应该积极从技术上加以指导，帮助培训技术人员和改革工具。在目前，粮油加工领导部门也应该同商业等有关部门加强协作，组织各加工企业交流经验，及时总结和推广新的经验，同时帮助解决一些实际困难，以推动工作不断前进。
    现在，一个粮食和油料加工的旺季已经到来，我们相信，全国粮油加工企业职工同志们一定能够鼓起冲天干劲，大搞技术革新，出色地完成粮油加工任务，为国家增产更多的成品粮和油脂。
