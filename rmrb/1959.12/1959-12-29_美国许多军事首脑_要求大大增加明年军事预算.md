Xinhua News Agency, December 27th dispatch from New York: According to a report in the American "Time" magazine, many American military leaders believe that the $41 billion in military spending recently planned by the U.S. government for the 1961 fiscal year is far from meeting the needs for the rapid development of modern weapons, and they are demanding a significant increase in next year's military expenditure.

The magazine said: "Almost no one (among the American military) believes that the $41 billion-plus budget for the 1961 fiscal year will provide the best, or even sufficient, defense. The reason is that the 1961 budget, like many previous budgets, is adapting too slowly to the rapid and irreconcilable changes in modern weapons technology."

"Time" magazine said that U.S. military leaders estimate that the military expenditure for the 1961 fiscal year must be increased from $41 billion to at least $43 billion or $44 billion "to get what they really need." The magazine took the opportunity to advocate that "there are good reasons to show that expenses should be increased in many aspects of the 1961 budget." The magazine believes that "from replacing the army's outdated rifles to drastically accelerating the production of intercontinental ballistic missiles and missile programs, many aspects urgently need more money."

The magazine complained that the U.S. government had been excessively dispersed in its use of military spending in the past. It believes that this phenomenon is caused by the fact that many monopoly capitalists are only concerned with competing for profits from military production.

　　美国许多军事首脑
    要求大大增加明年军事预算
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：据美国“时代”周刊报道，美国的许多军事首脑认为美国政府最近计划在1961财政年度拨出的四百一十亿美元的军事费用远不能满足迅速发展现代化武器的需要，他们要求大大增加明年的军费。
    这家刊物说：“（在美国的军人中）几乎没有人认为，1961财政年度四百一十多亿美元的预算将会提供最好的或是甚至足够的防御。理由是：1961年的预算同以前的许多预算一样，同现代武器技术的迅速而不可调和的变化适应得很慢。”
      “时代”周刊说，美国的军事首脑们估计，至少要把1961财政年度的军事费用从四百一十亿美元提高到四百三十亿或者四百四十亿美元“才能得到他们真正需要的东西”。这家刊物乘机鼓吹说，“有充分理由可以说明应该在1961年的预算的许多方面增加费用”。这家周刊认为，“从取代陆军过时的步枪到剧烈加速洲际弹道导弹的生产和导弹计划，许多方面都急需增加钱”。
    这家刊物抱怨美国政府过去在使用军费方面过分分散。它认为造成这种现象是由于许多垄断资本只顾争夺军事生产利润。
