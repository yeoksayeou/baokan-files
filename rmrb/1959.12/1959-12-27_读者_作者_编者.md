    Learning from the Spirit of Du Fengrui
    After this newspaper's supplement published articles about martyr Du Fengrui on December 7th and 8th, many readers wrote to the editorial department saying they were deeply moved after reading them and expressed their desire to learn from the spirit of martyr Du Fengrui. We are now selecting one letter to publish below:
    The People's Daily successively published martyr Du Fengrui's deeds, family letters, and diary on the eighth page of the December 7th and 8th issues. After reading them, I received a very vivid communist education. From the martyr's family letters and diary, it can be seen that the reason why Comrade Du Fengrui was able to become a brave and fearless soldier was because he had a high degree of political consciousness and a great spirit of collectivism. He not only modeled the implementation of the Party's policies and actively responded to the Party's call, but also educated his family to listen to the Party and follow the Party. I am a student who will graduate next year. I want to implement the martyr's heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, love for the collective, and noble qualities of loyalty to the Party into my actions. The glorious deeds of the martyr's life will always be a model for me to learn from.

    Happy to Read Workers' Poems
    The poem "The Captain is Back" written by coal miner Sun Youitian, published on the eighth page of the People's Daily on November 27th, is a good poem. This poem is refined, vivid, and popular in language, full of emotion, and reflects the current workers' soaring enthusiasm in the increase production and practice economy campaign. As the fourth paragraph of the poem writes: "Captain, you are back! Quickly introduce advanced experience; Although our coal production has jumped again and again, everyone still thinks it is too little!" The last paragraph says: "The water gun has been adjusted, the drill bit has been sharpened, you lead the way, Captain, which one of our group of young men isn't loudly shouting their enthusiasm." Without real life experience, such a vivid poem could not be written.
    We love to read workers' works, and we hope that the People's Daily supplement can often publish some of these workers' works in the future.
                Tangshan, Li Changjun
    Comrade Li Changjun's suggestion is very good. In the future, we will plan to select some workers' works for publication in the supplement. At the same time, we also hope that the publicity and education departments of various factories and mines will recommend some good works to us.

    Welcome Readers to Write "Short Comments"
    The article "Advanced Experience Needs to be Complete," published in the form of a "Reader Forum" on the second page of this newspaper on December 21, was well received by readers. In the past, various editions of this newspaper also published some short comments from the masses (such as "Everyone Talks" on the eighth page), which readers also liked to read. The reason why these short comments are so popular is because the authors live at the grassroots level, personally participate in production and construction and mass movements, and have a thorough and deep understanding of many things. Therefore, the things they write are fresh, vivid, and specific, making people feel close to them. We welcome the vast number of readers, especially workers, peasants, and grassroots cadres, to write short comments to make the comments in our newspaper more rich and colorful. Editor
    Opinions on a Title
    There was such a title on the first page of the December 18th issue: "One Factory Uses the General Line to Arm Ideas, One Factory Uses Technological Innovation to Attack Key Problems, Two Major Factories in Shanghai are Full of Enthusiasm and Achieve Early Success." Judging from the title, it seems that the former factory relied entirely on "abstract talk" to complete the task, while the latter factory simply relied on technology to complete the task. It is inappropriate to separate politics and technology or to put politics and technology on an equal footing. In fact, the contents of these two news items have already shown that both of these factories insisted on putting politics in command and carried out large-scale technological innovation, thus completing their annual plans ahead of schedule.

    学习杜凤瑞的精神
    12月7日、8日本报副刊发表有关杜凤瑞烈士的一些文章后，不少读者写信给编辑部，说读后很受感动，表示要学习杜凤瑞烈士的精神。现在选择一封来信发表如下：
    人民日报在12月7、8日的八版上，连续发表了杜凤瑞烈士的事迹、家书和日记，读过以后，从中受到了很生动的共产主义教育。从烈士的家书和日记中可以看到，杜凤瑞同志所以能成为勇敢无畏的战士，是由于他有着高度的政治觉悟和伟大的集体主义精神。他平时不仅自己模范地执行党的政策，积极响应党的号召，而且教育家属听党的话，跟着党走。我是一个明年即将毕业的学生，我要把烈士英勇顽强的战斗精神，热爱集体、忠于党的高尚品质，贯彻到我的行动中去。烈士一生的光辉事迹，永远是我学习的榜样。

    喜读工人诗
    11月27日人民日报八版所载煤矿工人孙友田写的诗“队长回来了”是首好诗。这首诗语言精炼、生动、通俗，感情充沛，反映了当前工人们在增产节约运动中的冲天干劲。如诗的第四段写道：“队长，回来了！快把先进经验介绍；咱们的煤产量，虽然一跃再跃，可大伙还是都嫌少！”最后一段说：“水枪已调整，钻头已磨好，你领头吧，队长，咱们这群小伙子，哪一个干劲不是当当叫。”没有真实的生活感受，是不会写出这样生动的诗篇的。
    我们很喜爱读工人的作品，希望人民日报副刊今后能经常发表一些这样的工人作品。
                唐山　李长君
    李长君同志的建议很好。今后我们将有计划地选择一些工人的作品在副刊发表。同时，也希望各厂矿的宣教部门推荐一些好作品给我们。

    欢迎读者写“小言论”
    12月21日本报二版用“读者论坛”形式发表了“先进经验需要配套”一文，读者反映很好。过去本报各版也发表一些来自群众的小言论（如八版“大家谈”），读者也很喜欢看。这些小言论所以受欢迎，是因为作者生活在基层，亲身参与了生产建设和群众运动，对很多事物了解得透，体会得深，因此写出的东西新鲜、生动、具体，使人看了感到亲切。我们欢迎广大读者特别是工农群众和基层干部写小言论，使我们报纸上的评论更加丰富多采。　编者
    对一个标题的意见
    12月18日一版上有这样一个标题：“一个厂用总路线武装思想，一个厂革新技术攻关键，上海两大厂干劲饱满提前告捷”。从标题来看，好像前一个厂全靠“务虚”完成任务，而后一个厂则单纯依靠技术完成任务。把政治和技术分家，或把政治和技术平列起来，都是不妥当的。事实上这两条消息内容已经说明，这两个厂都是坚持政治挂帅，并大搞技术革新，因而提前完成全年计划的。
