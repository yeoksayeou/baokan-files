Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 29th: TASS reported on the 29th that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin received French Ambassador to Moscow Dejean on the 28th and handed him a memorandum from the Soviet government regarding the date of the meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee.

The memorandum stated that, after consultation with Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, the Soviet government formally announced that the governments of these countries were prepared to convene the Ten-Nation Committee meeting as early as possible in 1960. Since the Western countries were unwilling to do so, the governments of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania did not object to holding the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting on March 15, 1960, or at another time close to this date, as suggested by the Western governments.

According to the communiqué issued by the Four Powers in August regarding the establishment of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, the committee was scheduled to begin work in early 1960. In November of this year, the US government submitted a memorandum to the Soviet government, hoping to begin work at the end of February 1960. Subsequently, on December 22, the French government submitted a memorandum on behalf of the governments of the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, the United States, and France, suggesting postponing the meeting to March 15 or a date close to it.

The Soviet government's memorandum is a response to the French government's memorandum of December 22.

The Soviet government's reply to the French government has been notified to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Canada, as well as the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

　　苏联政府致法国政府备忘录
    确定三月间召开十国裁军委员会会议
    新华社莫斯科29日电　据塔斯社29日报道：苏联外交部副部长佐林28日接见了法国驻莫斯科大使德让，并交给他一份苏联政府关于召开十国裁军委员会会议的日期的备忘录。
    备忘录说，经过同保加利亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚协商后，苏联政府正式宣布，这些国家的政府准备在1960年尽可能早的日期内召开十国委员会会议，既然西方国家不愿意这样做，那末，苏联、保加利亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚政府也不反对像西方国家政府建议的那样，在1960年3月15日或者接近这一日期的其他时间召开十国裁军委员会会议。
    按照四大国8月间发表的关于成立十国裁军委员会的公报，委员会规定在1960年初开始工作。今年11月间，美国政府曾向苏联政府提出备忘录，希望在1960年2月底开始工作。接着，12月22日，法国政府又提出备忘录，以英国、意大利、加拿大、美国和法国政府的名义，建议推迟到3月15日或接近这一日期的时间举行会议。
    苏联政府的备忘录就是对法国政府12月22日备忘录的答复。
    苏联政府答复法国政府的备忘录一事，已经通知美国、英国、意大利和加拿大政府以及联合国秘书长。
