Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 27th: The Central Committee's Nine-Person Group for the Prevention and Treatment of Schistosomiasis recently convened a work conference in Shanghai on disease eradication for thirteen southern provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party against right-leaning tendencies and promoting vigorous efforts, the conference reviewed the work of the past year, summarized and exchanged experiences, and discussed and determined the tasks for the continued leap forward in disease eradication work in the coming year.

In the past year, the disease eradication work in the thirteen southern provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions has achieved tremendous results. The number of patients treated and the results of pest elimination generally exceeded those of any previous year. The area cleared of snails in the past year was approximately 1.67 billion square meters. The density of rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies has also been greatly reduced through continuous extermination.

Due to the great victory of disease eradication work, the prevalence of schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, malaria, and other diseases has been rapidly shrinking and accelerating towards elimination. The tragic scene of "no smoke in villages for miles, white bones covered by three-foot weeds" in disease-prevalent areas of old China is fundamentally changing. In Phoenix Terrace Village, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, there are two folk songs that describe this huge change. The old one is: "Phoenix Terrace, Phoenix Terrace, the old woman can't bear children, the man is pregnant, the fertile land is uncultivated, with little clothing and no food, the wife won't come." The new one is: "Phoenix Terrace, Phoenix Terrace, diseases are eliminated and happiness comes, the fields yield more and people live longer, with ample food and clothing, smiles abound." Through disease eradication work, the broad masses have cultivated a new fashion of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene, improving their health level, thereby powerfully supporting production. Taking the millions of schistosomiasis patients who have been cured as an example, calculating an average increase in labor force of 40% per person, it is equivalent to adding more than one million full laborers. In addition, various regions have accumulated a large amount of fertilizer through snail eradication and the patriotic health movement. Many areas have also combined pest control with the reclamation of large tracts of wasteland, developed fishery and sideline production, renovated farmland water conservancy, and increased the income of the masses, achieving multiple benefits.

The conference believes that the key to the victory achieved in disease eradication work in the past year lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party, implementing political command, and launching a large-scale mass movement. The facts of disease eradication in various places over the past year have repeatedly proven that where the leadership of the Party has been strengthened, ideological education of prevention and treatment cadres has been tightened, and anti-rightist and vigorous efforts have been continuously promoted among cadres, the disease eradication movement has been booming and achieved great results. This is the case in the vast majority of regions. However, in some places, during a certain period, due to certain complacency and fear of hardship among cadres, the movement was once stagnant. The conference pointed out that prevention and treatment work is like sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you retreat. Only by mobilizing the masses and persisting in repeated struggles can the goal of completely eliminating diseases be achieved. Any right-leaning sentiments are obstacles to progress and must be resolutely overcome. The conference believes that the mass movement for disease eradication must adhere to the principle of combining shock tactics with regular work, and combining leading cadres, scientific and technical personnel, and the masses. It is important to continuously improve the scientific and technical knowledge of the masses in disease eradication, and gradually establish practical health systems and cultivate the habit of regular disease eradication among the masses in the struggle of disease eradication, so that the movement can be sustained for a long time.

The conference analyzed the current situation, believing that the socialist construction of the motherland is thriving, coupled with the rich experience in disease eradication that has already been gained, providing unprecedentedly favorable conditions for further developing disease eradication work. Therefore, disease eradication work in various places must catch up with the situation, fully utilize favorable conditions, continue to exert vigorous efforts, and launch a large-scale mass movement, in order to improve people's health and ensure the continued leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland.

In order to strive for a continued leap forward in disease eradication work next year, after discussion, the conference believes that pest control must concentrate efforts on first eliminating the "five pests" (sparrows, rats, flies, mosquitoes, snails) that pose the greatest threat to people in residential areas and areas frequently visited by residents. But this does not mean that pest control work is limited to the above areas. It is also necessary to try every means to gradually expand the scope of the struggle until the "five pests" are completely eliminated. The conference also pointed out that, according to the development process of the disease eradication movement, there are generally three steps: controlling the development of diseases, reducing the area of disease prevalence, and completely eliminating diseases. These three steps are interrelated and intertwined. Due to the different foundations of disease eradication work, the steps also vary between regions or within a region. Based on the specific situation of disease eradication work in various places, the conference put forward different requirements for various places in terms of future work tasks, calling on prevention and treatment cadres in various places to seize the favorable opportunity of launching a large-scale disease eradication movement this winter and next spring, combined with the movements of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, to quickly launch a new upsurge in disease eradication, and lay a victorious foundation for completing the tasks of the coming year.

### 发动群众同病害斗争到底  十三省市区除害灭病会议总结经验确定今后任务

　　发动群众同病害斗争到底
　  十三省市区除害灭病会议总结经验确定今后任务
　　凤凰台、凤凰台，
　　病害消灭幸福来，
　　田园增产人增寿，
　　丰衣足食笑颜开。
　　　　——湖南湘阴县凤凰台村民歌
    据新华社上海27日电　中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组最近在上海召开了南方十三个省、市、自治区的除害灭病工作会议。会议根据党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲的精神，检查了一年来的工作，总结和交流了经验，讨论和确定了今后一年除害灭病工作继续跃进的任务。
    近一年以来，南方十三个省、市、自治区的除害灭病工作成绩巨大，治疗病患者人数和灭害的成绩，一般超过以往任何一年。一年来灭螺面积约十六亿七千万平方米。鼠、雀、蚊、蝇经过不断歼灭，密度也大大下降了。
    由于除害灭病工作的伟大胜利，血吸虫病、钩虫病、丝虫病、疟疾和其它病害的流行已经在急剧缩小和加速消灭的过程中。旧中国病害流行区的“十里村庄无人烟，三尺蔓草掩白骨”的凄惨景象，在根本改变。湖南省湘阴县凤凰台村有两首民歌，描述这种巨大变化，旧的一首是：“凤凰台、凤凰台，婆不生崽男怀胎，粮田美土无人种，少衣无食妻不来。”新的一首是：“凤凰台、凤凰台，病害消灭幸福来，田园增产人增寿，丰衣足食笑颜开。”通过除害灭病工作，广大群众培养了爱清洁、讲卫生的新风尚，提高了健康水平，从而有力地支援了生产。以治好的几百万血吸虫病人来说，按每人平均增加劳动力40％计算，就相当于新增了整劳动力一百多万人。此外，各地通过灭螺和爱国卫生运动，增积了大量的肥料。不少地区还结合除害，开垦了大片荒地，发展了渔副业生产，整修了农田水利，增加群众的收益，获得了一举数得的效果。
    会议认为一年来除害灭病工作所取得的胜利，关键在于加强了党的领导，实行政治挂帅和大搞群众运动。一年来各地除害灭病的事实一再证明：那里加强了党的领导，抓紧了对防治干部的思想教育，不断在干部中反右倾、鼓干劲，那里的除害灭病运动就轰轰烈烈，取得了巨大成绩。这样的地区是绝大多数。但是，有些地方在某一段时期内，由于干部出现了某些麻痹松劲和怕苦畏难的情绪，就使运动一度滞缓不前。会议指出：防治工作有如逆水行舟，不进即退，只有把千千万万的群众发动起来，坚持不懈地进行反复斗争，才能达到彻底消灭病害的目的。任何右倾情绪，都是前进中的障碍，必须坚决克服。会议认为：除害灭病的群众运动必须坚持贯彻突击和经常工作相结合，领导干部、科学技术人员和群众三结合的原则，不断提高群众除害灭病的科学技术知识水平，并在除害灭病的斗争中逐步建立切实可行的卫生制度，培养起群众经常除害灭病的习惯，才能使运动长期坚持下去。
  　会议分析了当前形势，认为祖国社会主义建设一片兴旺景象，加上已有了丰富的除害灭病的经验，为进一步发展除害灭病工作提供了空前有利的条件。因此，各地除害灭病工作必须赶上形势，充分运用有利条件继续鼓足干劲大搞群众运动，以便增进人民健康，保证祖国的社会主义建设事业的继续跃进。
    为了力争明年除害灭病工作继续跃进，会议经过讨论认为，除害必须集中力量首先将居民区和居民常到地区对人们危害最大的“五害”（麻雀、老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子、钉螺）消灭，但这决不是说，除害工作仅限于以上地区，还必须想尽办法把斗争的范围逐步扩大开去，直到把“五害”彻底消灭为止。会议又指出，根据除害灭病运动的发展过程，一般有控制病害发展、缩小病害面积和彻底消灭三个步骤。这三个步骤是互相关联的；又是互相交错的，因除害灭病工作的基础的不同，在地区与地区之间、或在一个地区中步骤也有所不同。根据各地除害灭病工作具体情况，会议在今后工作任务上对各地提出了不同的要求，号召各地防治干部抓紧今冬明春大搞除害灭病运动的有利时机，结合兴修水利和积肥等运动，迅速掀起除害灭病的新高潮，为完成今后一年的任务打下胜利的基础。
