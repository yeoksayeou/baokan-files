Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: Under the leadership of the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in factories and mines across the country have, since the beginning of this year, adopted mass movement methods to train new workers, enabling the large number of new workers who joined production since the Great Leap Forward last year to grow rapidly. At present, about 80% of the new workers nationwide can operate independently, and about 30% have been rated as advanced producers and excellent apprentices, becoming a vital force in promoting the continued leap forward in industry this year.

The vast majority of these new workers are young people. In order to enable them to improve rapidly in terms of ideology and technology, Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in factories and mines in various places have strengthened the training of new workers. For example, in addition to conducting political and ideological education for new workers through report meetings and other forms, various places also frequently conduct intensive mass self-education through extensive airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters, based on the ideological problems exposed by them at different times. In terms of technical training, various places have implemented a two-pronged approach, on the one hand, running technical schools, spare-time schools, and technical training classes, and on the other hand, developing mass training methods on a large scale, carrying out transmission activities such as "the capable being teachers," "masters leading apprentices," "senior apprentices helping junior apprentices," and "one master leading a hundred apprentices, a hundred apprentices becoming a hundred masters." Some places have also organized technical demonstrations and technical reviews based on the needs of production. Recently, many places have learned from the experience of Taiyuan City and widely carried out study and summary activities for new workers on the anniversary of their entry into the factory, helping new workers summarize their ideological and technical gains over the past year, check the problems in their studies and work, insert red flags, establish pace-setters, and mobilize new workers to formulate plans for continued progress in the second academic year.

This mass training work, on the one hand, has mobilized the enthusiasm of new workers for learning and labor, and on the other hand, has also enhanced the sense of responsibility of veteran workers to bring up good apprentices. Many veteran workers actively and enthusiastically help new workers in all aspects to "become ideologically sound and technically proficient." We propose to become role models for new workers in politics, teachers for new workers in technology, and friends for new workers in life. Since the beginning of this year, factories and mines in various places have launched a "three-help and five-good competition," in which veteran workers help new workers with their ideology, technology, and life, and new workers strive to be good in ideology, study, labor, discipline, and unity. Many veteran workers often tell new workers about the revolutionary traditions of the working class, the tragic lives of apprentices in the old society, and the excellent qualities of workers who love the factory as their home and consciously work after liberation. Some master craftsmen have improved their teaching methods and created many good ways to impart technology, such as on-site classes, ten-minute technical lectures after work, and small-scale competitions. Qu Zhengyi, a veteran worker at the Hunan Xiangjiang Machinery Factory, took twelve apprentices. He arranged his daily work well and taught by making the rounds. After the apprentices became proficient in a process, they became teachers to each other. In this way, although he was the only master craftsman in the entire work section, the production efficiency was ten times higher than that of one person, and the task was overfulfilled every month. Wang Zhaofeng, a welder at the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, in order to give his apprentices frequent opportunities for practical training and learn various welding techniques, painstakingly studied and created a multi-head welding machine for his apprentices in the absence of welding machines. The apprentices who studied with him were able to operate independently after four months. Many master craftsmen also carry forward the spirit of class friendship and care for new workers meticulously. At the Baoji Xinqin Textile Factory, due to the increase in the number of apprentices, the dormitories were temporarily insufficient, so many veteran workers squeezed together to sleep and vacated beds for the new workers.

Through the mass movement method of training new workers, new workers in various places have generally begun to establish the idea of loving labor, loving the collective, and loving work, and the phenomenon of apprentices not abiding by discipline and not being content with their work has been greatly reduced. 90% of the new workers in Beijing are content with their jobs. According to a survey of thirteen factories in the city, about 95% of the new workers, with the help of veteran workers, have been able to independently take over the shift for production, and about 80% of them have been able to complete the master's quota. In sixty-three units such as the Shanxi Machinery Factory in Taiyuan City, more than 7,000 new workers have completed their production plans ahead of schedule and entered 1960. The underground workers who entered the Kailuan Coal Mine during the Great Leap Forward last year are now all able to operate independently, and more than 1,000 red flag shock workers have emerged.

After improving their ideological awareness, many new workers gave play to the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, and made outstanding contributions in the technical innovation movement. New workers from 199 factories and mines in Taiyuan City put forward more than 21,000 technical innovation proposals, increasing efficiency by one to fifty times and solving more than 600 major key problems. Du Zengyu, a young apprentice at the Qingdao Heavy Machinery Plant, with the help of his master craftsman, created an electric facing machine, a fast core-digging machine, etc., which increased efficiency by eight to ten times respectively. Lu Xiuqin, an apprentice at the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Machinery Factory, created the two-handed operation method in less than half a year after entering the factory, making the daily output of products reach the highest level in the factory.

During the Great Leap Forward, a large number of outstanding apprentices improved their political awareness and joined the Communist Youth League, and some were even accepted into the Communist Party of China. Since the beginning of this year, 208 new workers in Beijing have joined the Communist Youth League. More than 100 new workers in Taiyuan City have joined the Communist Party, and more than 1,800 have joined the Communist Youth League. (Attached picture)

　　一年来在群众运动的熔炉中千锤百炼
    新工人思想入伍技术入门
    80％的人可独立操作，30％的人成为先进生产者和优秀徒工
    新华社28日讯　各地厂矿企业的行政、工会、共青团组织在党的领导下，今年以来采取群众运动的办法培训新工人，使去年大跃进以来参加生产的大批新工人迅速成长起来。目前全国已有80％左右的新工人可以独立操作，30％左右的人被评为先进生产者和优秀徒工，他们成为促进今年工业继续跃进的一支生力军。
    这些新工人绝大多数都是青年，为了使他们在思想上和技术上迅速提高，各地厂矿企业的党、政、工、团组织都加强了对新工人的培训工作。例如各地除了通过报告会等形式向新工人进行政治思想教育以外，还经常根据他们不同时期暴露出来的思想问题，大鸣大放大辩论，进行集中的群众性的自我教育。在技术训练方面，各地实行两条腿走路的办法，一方面举办技工学校、业余学校、技术训练班等，一方面又大量发展群众性的训练方法，开展“能者为师”，“师傅带徒弟”，“师兄帮师弟”，“一师带百徒、百徒变百师”的传授活动。有的地方还根据生产的需要，组织了技术大表演和技术大检阅活动。最近许多地方学习太原市的经验，又在新工人中广泛开展入厂一周年的学习总结活动，帮助新工人总结一年来思想上和技术上的收获，检查学习和劳动中的问题，插红旗，树标兵，发动新工人订出第二个学年继续进步的规划。
    这种群众性的培训工作，一方面调动了新工人学习和劳动的积极性，一方面也增强了老工人带好徒弟的责任心。许多老工人都积极热情地从各方面帮助新工人作到“思想入伍，技术入门”，我们提出要在政治上成为新工人的标兵，技术上成为新工人的师傅，生活上成为新工人的朋友。今年以来，各地厂矿企业开展了老工人对新工人帮思想、帮技术、帮生活，新工人努力作到思想好、学习好、劳动好、纪律好、团结好的“三帮五好竞赛”。许多老工人下班后经常向新工人讲述工人阶级的革命传统、旧社会徒工的悲惨生活，以及解放后工人爱厂如家、自觉劳动的优秀品质。有的老师傅改进了教徒方法，创造了现场上课、班后十分钟技术讲座、小型比武等很多传授技术的好办法。湖南湘江机器厂老工人屈正仪，一个人带十二个徒弟，他把每天工作安排好，自己巡回教导，学徒们熟练了一道工序后又相互为师，这样全工段虽只他一个师傅，但生产效率却比一个人干提高了十倍，月月超额完成任务。四方机车车辆厂焊工王兆凤，为了让徒工经常有实际操练的机会，学会多种焊接技术，在电焊机缺乏的情况下，苦心钻研，为徒工创造了一架多头电焊机。跟他学习的徒工，四个月以后就都能独立操作。许多老师傅还发扬阶级友爱精神，无微不至地关怀新工人。宝鸡新秦纺织厂由于徒工增加，宿舍暂时不够住，许多老工人就互相挤着睡，腾出床位给新工人。
    各地通过群众运动的办法培训新工人，使新工人一般都开始树立了热爱劳动、热爱集体、热爱工作的思想，徒工中不守纪律、不安心工作的现象已大大减少。北京市90％的新工人都安心本岗位的工作。据这个市十三个厂调查，有95％左右的新工人在老师傅的帮助下，已能独立顶班生产，其中有80％左右的人已经可以完成师傅定额。太原市山西机器厂等六十三个单位中，就有七千多新工人提前完成生产计划，跨入1960年。开滦煤矿去年大跃进中进矿的井下工人，现在已全部能够独立操作，并涌现出一千多名红旗突击手。
    许多新工人提高思想觉悟以后，发挥敢想敢干的精神，在技术革新运动中有了出色的贡献。太原市一百九十九个厂矿企业的新工人，共提出技术革新建议二万一千多件，提高效率一倍至五十倍，解决了重大关键问题六百多项。青岛重型机械厂青年徒工杜增玉在老师傅的帮助下，创造了电动齐头机、快速挖芯机等，分别提高效率八倍至十倍。国营上海第二机械厂徒工陆秀琴进厂不到半年时间，就创造了双手操作法，使产品的日产量达到全厂的最高水平。
    在大跃进中，大批优秀徒工提高了政治觉悟，参加了共青团，有的还被接受参加了中国共产党。北京市今年以来就有二百零八名新工人参加了共青团。太原市已有一百多名新工人加入共产党，一千八百多人加入共青团。（附图片）
