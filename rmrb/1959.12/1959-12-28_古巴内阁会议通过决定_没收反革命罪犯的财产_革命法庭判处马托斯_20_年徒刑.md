    Those arrested confessed that they were preparing to carry out personal assassinations and sabotage activities starting on the 24th.
    The Pinar del Río Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced James Buchanan, an American who engaged in illegal activities in Cuba under the identity of a "Miami Herald" reporter, to fourteen years in prison and ordered him to leave Cuba within twenty-four hours. Buchanan was convicted of harboring Yangge, a fugitive counter-revolutionary special agent.

　　古巴内阁会议通过决定
    没收反革命罪犯的财产
    革命法庭判处马托斯20年徒刑
    古巴内阁会议12月22日通过了一项关于没收反革命罪犯和为了逃避革命法庭的审判而逃离古巴的罪犯的全部财产的法律。这条法律也适用于在国外进行反政府活动的分子。
    古巴警察局23日破获了一个反革命集团，逮捕了四十人并且没收了一批武器。
    被捕者承认，他们准备从24日开始进行人身谋杀和破坏活动。
    比那尔德里奥革命法庭判处了以“迈阿密先驱报”记者身份到古巴进行不法活动的美国人詹姆斯·布坎南十四年徒刑，并且限他在二十四小时内离开古巴。布坎南是因窝藏潜逃的反革命特务杨格而被判罪的。
    古巴革命法庭15日判处叛国犯、前卡马圭省部队司令乌维尔特·马托斯二十年徒刑。参与叛乱的其他从犯也分别判处了不同期限的徒刑。
