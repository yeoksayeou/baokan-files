    Leaping Greatly Forward Wavelets
    Zuo Keguo
    Grandpa Shepherd has a herding whip,
    Used it for seventy and three years,
    A sheepskin coat,
    With large circles on both shoulders.
    Last year, with the commune,
    The herding whip was given to us,
    Driving the herd owner to lower his head,
    Driving the sheep to fill the grassland,
    Driving the grassland to laugh heartily,
    The herdsmen took a step to heaven.
    “Leading the Tongji Huang” Song
  Chisel through the Qilian Mountains,
  Divert the Datong River,
  Rice grows on the grassland,
  Green shade covers the desert.
  Hold up Riyue Mountain,
  Roll up the Gobi Desert,
  Wield the spear to melt the snow mountain,
  Good fields cover the plateau.

    跃进浪花
    左可国
    牧鞭爷爷有个牧羊鞭，赶了七十零三年，一件羊皮袄，双肩通大圈。去年公社化，牧鞭交给咱，赶得牧主低了头，赶得羊儿满草原，赶得草原哈哈笑，牧民一步登了天。
    “引通济湟”歌
  凿穿祁连山，
  导引大通河，
  草原长水稻，
  绿荫罩沙漠。
  擎住日月山，
  卷起戈壁滩，
  挥戈溶雪岭，
  良田盖高原。
