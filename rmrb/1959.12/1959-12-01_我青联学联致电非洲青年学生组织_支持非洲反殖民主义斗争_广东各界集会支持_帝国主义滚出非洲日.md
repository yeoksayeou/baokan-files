Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent telegrams to African youth and student organizations respectively, expressing full support for the just struggle of the African people and youth against colonialism and for national independence.

The All-China Youth Federation, in a telegram to African youth friends through the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, said, "On the occasion of 'Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day,' we, on behalf of 130 million Chinese youth, express our highest respect and firm support to the African people and youth who are heroically struggling against colonialism and for national independence."

The telegram said, "We are very excited to see that, in today's world where the power of the people far exceeds the power of imperialism, the struggle of the African people and youth for national independence and freedom is irresistibly impacting the tottering colonial system."

The telegram said, "We firmly believe that, with the strong support of socialist countries, the people of Asian and African countries, and justice-upholding people all over the world, the awakened African people and youth, as long as they strengthen unity and persist in struggle, will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory. Imperialism must get out of Africa!"

The All-China Youth Federation's telegram to the African Youth Council stated, "No matter how frantically imperialism carries out suppression and political deception, and no matter how hard American imperialism tries to undermine the African national liberation movement, these cannot stop the powerful African people's national liberation movement from advancing by leaps and bounds."

The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation also sent telegrams to the Moroccan Youth League, the Guinean African Youth Democratic Union, the Cameroon Democratic Youth Union, and the General Association of Muslim Students of Algeria, supporting their just struggle to win and safeguard national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a grand meeting today, warmly responding to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold "Congo Day" and "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," and resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Congolese and Asian-African people for national independence and against colonialism.

Lin Qiangyun, Chairman of the Guangdong Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He said that the people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City firmly support the just struggle of the heroic Congolese and African people against imperialism, against colonialism, and for national independence, and strongly condemn the criminal activities of the Belgian colonial rulers in massacring the Congolese people with the support of American imperialism. After reporting on the struggle of the Congolese and African people for national independence and against colonialism, Lin Qiangyun said: American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the national independence movement in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and of the world peace and democracy movement. Recently, the American authorities, in the face of the world people's powerful peace forces, have been forced to make some easing gestures, attempting to paralyze peace-loving people. However, we are fully convinced that this conspiracy of American imperialism cannot succeed and cannot stop the heroic African people from advancing on the road to national independence. Lin Qiangyun concluded by saying: Today, the forces of peace far outweigh the forces of war. Under such an unprecedentedly favorable situation, we must further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and further strengthen the great unity with the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. We firmly believe that the national independence movement and the world peace movement will achieve a comprehensive, thorough, and final victory throughout the world.

Liang Chao, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, then spoke, representing the working class of Guangzhou City in expressing high respect and firm support to the working class and people of the Congo and Africa. Yu Hui, Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Women's Federation, and Liao Zhouxing, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Youth Federation, also spoke at the meeting, expressing their firm support for the heroic struggle of the Congolese and African people.

    据新华社30日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会今天分别致电非洲的青年和学生组织，表示全力支持非洲人民和青年反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争。
    中华全国青年联合会在通过亚非人民团结理事会打给非洲青年朋友们的电报中说，“值此‘帝国主义滚出非洲日’到来之际，我们谨代表一亿三千万中国青年向正在为反对殖民主义、争取民族独立而英勇斗争着的非洲人民和青年，表示崇高的敬意和坚决的支持。”
    电报说，“我们非常兴奋地看到，在世界人民的力量大大超过帝国主义力量的今天，非洲人民和青年争取民族独立和自由的斗争，正以不可抗拒之势，冲击着摇摇欲坠的殖民主义制度。”
    电报说，“我们深信，在社会主义国家、亚非各国人民和全世界主持正义人民的有力支持下，觉悟了的非洲人民和青年只要加强团结、坚持斗争，就一定能够冲破各种困难，取得最后的胜利。帝国主义一定要从非洲土地上滚出去！”
    中华全国青年联合会给非洲青年理事会的电报中说，“不管帝国主义进行怎样疯狂的镇压和政治欺骗，不管美帝国主义怎样千方百计地破坏非洲民族解放运动，这些都阻挡不了强大的非洲人民民族解放运动的阔步前进。”
    中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会并分别致电摩洛哥青年联盟、几内亚非洲青年民主联盟、喀麦隆民主青年联盟、阿尔及利亚穆斯林学生总会，支持他们争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争。
    据新华社广州30日电　广东省和广州市各界人民一千多人今天隆重集会，热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会关于举行“刚果日”和“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的号召，坚决支持刚果和亚非人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的正义斗争。
