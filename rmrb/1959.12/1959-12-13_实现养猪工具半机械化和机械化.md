    Achieving Semi-Mechanization and Mechanization of Pig Raising Tools
    Hebei Daily Editorial

    The Happiness Road Production Team of the Xiaozhan Commune in the Hexi District of Tianjin has vigorously carried out technological innovations in pig raising production, achieving semi-mechanization and semi-automation of feed processing and the pig raising process. One person has increased their pig raising from forty to two hundred pigs, achieving the goal of using less labor to raise more pigs. This is a good move. It points out an important path for resolving the contradiction between the large-scale development of pigs and the shortage of labor. All societies and teams in the province should actively promote this practice to meet the needs of the large-scale development of pigs.

    Since the Provincial Party Committee issued the call to strive for one pig per person next year, the development of pigs has been rapid. In the past month or so, the province has increased its pig population by more than two million. With the increase in pigs, the tasks of feed processing, manure transportation, water supply, and pig feeding have also increased, resulting in a shortage of labor for pig raising production. Thus, resolving the contradiction between the large-scale development of pigs and the shortage of labor has become a very urgent issue in the development of pig raising production. Currently, a feeder can generally only feed 20 to 30 pigs, and at most 40. If we reach one pig per person next year, we will need more than one million feeders, which is three to four times more than now. In the year after next, we will have even greater development, and the number of feeders will have to increase by one or two times. Where will so much labor come from? Is it okay to draw a large number of laborers from agricultural production? No. Because with the continued great leap forward in agricultural production, we must not only further strengthen field management, but also engage in large-scale agricultural infrastructure construction, and also do a good job in diversified operations, etc. Excessive extraction of labor in these areas will affect the overall leap forward in production. What is the way out? The Happiness Road Production Team has pointed out a path for us, which is to vigorously carry out tool reform, realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of pig raising production, improve feeding efficiency, and achieve the goal of using less labor to feed more pigs.

    To vigorously carry out tool reform in pig raising production and achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization, we must implement the principle of "local methods as the mainstay, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials, and manufacturing locally." Implementing this principle can quickly realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of pig raising and promote the pig raising industry. Under the circumstances of large-scale pig development, it would be great if the state could supply modern machinery to improve labor efficiency and solve the problem of labor shortages. The problem is that China's industry cannot fully meet this requirement at present. We must do it ourselves, vigorously engage in local machinery to meet the current urgent needs and gradually transition to mechanization. Doing so can simplify things, save expenses, and get more done with less money; it can fully tap the potential of the masses and turn many usually useless things into extremely useful things; local manufacturing and local promotion, with quick results; it can cultivate good habits of self-reliance among the broad masses of cadres and members. There are many favorable conditions for doing so at present: tool reform is an urgent requirement of the vast number of feeders, and their enthusiasm for improving tools is extremely high; since the tool reform wave that emerged last year, a large number of skilled craftsmen who reform tools have emerged, and they are scattered throughout every village; more importantly, after communization, commune-run industries have made a leap forward in development, bringing extremely favorable conditions for the appraisal, manufacturing, and promotion of improved tools. Therefore, implementing the principle of "local methods as the mainstay, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials, and manufacturing locally" is not only necessary but also possible. The idea that semi-mechanization and mechanization must require machines from superiors is wrong.

    The key to implementing this principle well lies in earnestly mobilizing the masses. Because this principle itself is based on fully relying on and mobilizing the masses. Some people think that tool reform is a matter for specialized personnel and does not require mobilizing the masses. This idea is wrong. Tool reform requires materials. Can it be done without the broad masses? It requires funds. Can it be done without the masses if we can't reach out to superiors? Reforming a tool is impossible without the wisdom of the broad masses. In short, there is no tool reform without the masses. According to the experience of the Happiness Road Production Team, in order to mobilize the masses, in addition to mobilizing the masses to use their brains, contribute materials, and provide funds, the best way is to combine skilled craftsmen, feeders, and cadres. This can better concentrate the wisdom of the masses. Feeders know best which tools should be reformed and what the requirements are, while skilled craftsmen know best how to reform a tool, where to start, and how to make it more effective. With this combination, plus the strong leadership of the Party, tools can not only be reformed in a timely manner and avoid detours, but also save raw materials and funds, achieving the goal of reforming tools with more, faster, better, and more economical results. This has been fully proven by the facts of the "Happiness Road" production team.

    Since local methods are the mainstay, simplifying things, and relying on our own efforts, we cannot demand "perfection" for the tools reformed by the masses. If the requirements are too high, it will tie the hands of the masses and dampen their enthusiasm for tool reform. We should have an attitude of full enthusiasm. As long as the tools reformed by the masses are appraised and meet the three principles of high efficiency, durability, and economy, they should be actively promoted. In the process of promotion and use, we should seek improvement and gradually move from low to high, from local to foreign. In fact, no matter what kind of modern tools, they are all developed in this way. It is impossible to imagine that a tool that has never been manufactured before can be completely ideal after one reform. There is no such thing as "perfection" in the world. From using a clumsy plow to cultivate the land to using a tractor to cultivate the land, it should be said that it is "perfection", but with the development of production and science, there will be better machines than tractors. Therefore, we must encourage all the initiatives of the masses. Don't be afraid if it doesn't work once, and encourage the masses to continue to think of ways to reform. Only in this way can the reform of pig raising tools become a mass movement, so that everyone can contribute ideas and everyone can take action, and gradually all the processes of pig raising can be semi-mechanized and mechanized.

    The development of pigs is very fast, and the demand for tools is urgent, and it is difficult to reform them all at once. Therefore, in the process of tool reform, we must first grasp the key points, that is, first grasp the tools that occupy the most labor in pig raising production, such as feed processing and transportation tools, and then grasp the tool reform in terms of drinking water and feeding, so as to use limited manpower, materials, and time to solve the urgent needs of reality in a timely manner; at the same time, this has a great effect, and it is easy to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses to reform tools, so that everyone can take action. In this way, from simple to complex, from low to high, from less to more, we can gradually realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of pig raising tools.

    The large-scale development of pig raising, accumulating more fertilizer and increasing production, while increasing the supply of social meat and exports, is not only the task of agricultural production, but also the task of industrial departments. Therefore, industrial departments, especially local industries, should take helping communes realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of pig raising tools as an important task and do everything possible to support them in order to meet the needs of the large-scale development of pigs.

    实现养猪工具半机械化和机械化
    河北日报社论
    天津市河西区小站公社幸福之路生产队大搞养猪生产的技术革新，实现了饲料加工和养猪过程的半机械化半自动化，一个人由养猪四十头增到二百头，达到了少用人多养猪的目的。这一手抓得好，它给解决猪只大发展与劳力不足的矛盾指出了一条重要道路，全省所有社、队都应积极推广这种做法，适应猪只大发展的需要。
    最近省委发出为明年实现一人一猪而奋斗的号召以后，猪只发展很快。近一个多月来，全省就增加猪只二百多万头。随着猪只的增加，饲料的加工、粪便的运送、饮水的供应和猪只的喂养等方面的任务，也跟着增加，出现了养猪生产的劳动力不足的现象。这样，解决猪只大发展和劳力不足的矛盾，就成为发展养猪生产中一个十分迫切的问题。目前一个饲养员一般只能喂养二十至三十头猪，多的也不过四十头，明年如果达到一人一猪，就需要饲养员一百多万个，要比现在增加三、四倍。后年还要大发展，饲养员还得增加一、两倍。这样多的劳动力从哪里来？如果从农业生产方面抽出大批的劳力行不行呢？不行。因为随着农业生产继续大跃进的形势，不仅要进一步加强田间管理，还要大搞农业基本建设，同时还要搞好多种经营等等，过多抽用这些方面的劳动力，就要影响生产全面跃进。出路何在呢？幸福之路生产队给我们指出了一条道路，就是大搞工具改革，实现养猪生产的半机械化和机械化，提高喂养效能，做到少用人多喂猪。
    大搞养猪生产的工具改革，实现半机械化和机械化，必须贯彻执行“土法为主，土洋结合，就地取材，就地制造”的方针。贯彻执行这一方针，就能迅速地实现养猪的半机械化、机械化，推动养猪事业。在猪只大发展的情况下，国家能供应现代化的机械，以提高劳动效率解决劳力不足的问题，这当然是再好不过的了，问题是目前我国工业还不能完全满足这种要求，必须自己动手，大搞土机械，以适应当前急需，逐步过渡到机械化。这样做，可以因陋就简，节约开支，少花钱多办事；可以充分挖掘群众的潜力，把许多平日无用的东西变成极有用的东西；就地制造就地推广，见效快；可以培养广大干部和社员自力更生的良好习惯。在目前这样办的有利条件也很多：改革工具是广大饲养人员的迫切要求，他们改良工具的情绪极高；从去年兴起的改革工具浪潮，涌现了大批改革工具的能工巧匠，他们遍布每个村庄；更重要的是公社化后，社办工业有了飞跃发展，给鉴定、制造和推广改良的工具，带来了极有利的条件。所以执行“土法为主，土洋结合，就地取材，就地制造”的方针，不仅是需要的，也是可能的。那种认为要半机械化、机械化就必须向上级要机器的想法是不对的。
    执行好这一方针，关键在于认真发动群众。因为这一方针本身，就是建立在充分依靠与发动群众基础之上的。有些人认为改革工具是专门人才的事情，无需乎发动群众，这种想法是不对的。改革工具需要物料，没有广大群众行不行？要资金，不能向上伸手，离了群众行不行呢？改革一件工具，没有广大群众的智慧，也是办不到的。总之，离开群众就没有工具改革。根据幸福之路生产队的经验，要把群众发动起来，除了发动群众开动脑筋、投物料、出资金以外，最好的办法就是使能工巧匠、饲养人员和干部结合起来。这样更能集中群众智慧。饲养人员最了解应当改革哪些工具，要求是什么，而能工巧匠又最了解一种工具如何改法，从哪里改起，怎样才能更发挥效能等等。有了这种结合，加上党的坚强领导，工具不仅能及时改成，少走弯路，还能节约原料和资金，达到多、快、好、省改革工具的目的。这一点，已经被“幸福之路”生产队的事实所充分证明了。
    既然是以土法为主，因陋就简，自力更生，我们对于群众改革的工具，就不能要求“十全十美”。如果要求过高，就会束缚住群众的手脚，打击群众改革工具的热情。应当抱满腔热情的态度，只要群众改革的工具经过鉴定，合乎效率高、耐用、节约三原则，就应积极推广，在推广使用过程中再求提高，逐步做到由低到高，由土到洋。其实，不管什么样的现代化的工具，都是这样发展起来的，不可能设想过去没有制造过的工具，一改就完全合乎理想。世界上“十全十美”的事是没有的，由笨犁耕地到拖拉机耕地，应当说是“十全十美”的了，但是，随着生产和科学的发展，还会有比拖拉机更好的机器。因此，我们要鼓励群众的一切创举，一次改不成也不要怕，要鼓励群众继续想办法改制。只有这样，才能使改革养猪工具成为群众性的运动，做到人人献计，个个动手，逐步地把养猪过程各个工序全部达到半机械化和机械化。
    猪只发展很快，对工具要求迫切，一时又难以全部改革好，因此，在改革工具过程中，首先要抓重点，也就是先抓养猪生产中占用劳力最多的工具，例如饲料加工和运输工具，然后再抓饮水和喂养方面的工具改革，做到用有限的人力、物料和时间，及时解决现实的迫切要求；同时，这样做效果大，也易于动员群众改革工具的热情，做到人人动手。这样由简到繁，由低到高，由少到多，就可逐步实现养猪工具的半机械化和机械化。
    大量发展养猪，多积肥、多增产，同时增加社会肉食供应和出口，不仅是农业生产的任务，也是工业部门的任务。因此，工业部门特别是地方工业，要把帮助公社实现养猪工具半机械化和机械化作为一项重要的任务，千方百计地给以支援，以适应猪只大发展的需要。
