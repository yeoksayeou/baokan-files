Ships and Vehicles Arrive, Load and Unload Immediately
Ningbo Port Makes Major Innovations, Unloading Efficiency More Than Doubles
    Ningbo Port in Zhejiang Province has been vigorously promoting technical innovations and technical revolutions in handling and unloading. The overall handling and unloading efficiency of the port has increased by one to two times. The stay time of motorized ships in the port has been shortened from more than 30 hours to about 16 hours, achieving immediate loading and unloading upon arrival of vehicles and ships.
    After more than three months of effort, the transportation workers of Ningbo Port manufactured and built large dump trucks, light cargo trucks, wine jar trucks, conveyors, chutes, overhead weighbridges, cranes, simple wooden platforms, cement roads, light mobile tracks, light rail cars, winches, and belt conveyors. They also installed power supply systems and rationally organized these handling and unloading equipment and tools, connecting them to form three organic loading and unloading systems for joint operations. The first is a handling and unloading system centered on double-line light rail tracks and cranes, for loading and unloading goods from ships without cranes. A ship with a load of 50 tons can be loaded and unloaded in two hours, with a work efficiency two to four times higher than manual labor. The second is a handling and unloading system centered on vehicle transportation, for loading coal, gravel, and other goods, improving work efficiency by more than two times. The third is a handling and unloading system centered on belt conveyors, for loading and unloading bulk materials such as coal and yellow sand. Using this method for a ship with a load of 930 tons, the ship's stay time in port is reduced by two-thirds.

    车船到港随装随卸
    宁波港大搞革新装卸效率提高一倍以上
    浙江省宁波港大搞搬运装卸技术革新和技术革命，全港搬运装卸效率提高一至二倍，机动船舶留港时间由三十多小时缩短为十六小时左右，做到了车船到港，随装随卸。
    宁波港运输职工经过三个多月的努力，制造和新建了大型翻斗车、轻泡货车、酒坛车、输送机、溜板、空中吊磅、起重机、简易木平台、水泥路、轻便活动轨道、轻轨车、卷扬机、皮带输送机，安装了电力供应系统，并且把这些搬运装卸设备和工具进行合理组织，相互衔接配套，形成三个有机的装卸系统，进行联合操作作业。第一是以双线轻便轨道和起重机为中心的搬运装卸系统，装卸各种没有起重设备的船舶的货物。一艘载重五十吨的船只，在二小时内可以装卸完毕，工效比人工提高二倍到四倍。第二是以车子化为中心的搬运装卸系统，装煤炭、碎石等货物，提高工作效率二倍以上。第三是以皮带输送为中心的搬运装卸系统，装卸煤炭、黄沙等散装物资。一艘载重九百三十吨的轮船，采用这种办法，船舶留港时间缩短三分之二。
