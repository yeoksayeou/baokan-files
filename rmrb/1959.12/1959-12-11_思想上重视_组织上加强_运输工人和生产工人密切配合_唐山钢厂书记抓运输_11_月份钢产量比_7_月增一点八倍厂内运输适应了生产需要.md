    Great Importance in Thought, Strengthened Organizationally, Close Cooperation Between Transport Workers and Production Workers:
    Tangshan Steel Plant Secretary Takes Charge of Transportation
    November Steel Production Increases 1.8 Times Compared to July, Transportation Within the Plant Meets Production Needs
    
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 10th dispatch) Tangshan Steel Plant leading cadres and the broad masses of workers are using the same energy as they do for grasping production to vigorously develop the construction of transportation within the plant. Since August, the average daily transportation volume within the plant has increased from more than 7,800 tons to the current more than 23,500 tons. The steel production level in November increased 1.8 times compared to July. The transportation work not only met the needs of production but also cleared more than 20,000 tons of slag and scrap steel accumulated in the plant for a long time.
    
    After the sharp increase in production at Tangshan Steel Plant, the transportation tasks within the plant became very heavy. Before August this year, due to the insufficient understanding of the importance of transportation work by a few leading cadres, they only focused on production, and the transportation work was not grasped tightly enough. Therefore, with the continuous development of production, the transportation work became increasingly passive.
  In order to fundamentally reverse the passive situation of transportation work and develop production at high speed, the Party committee of this plant organized the workshops and transportation departments to examine and criticize the one-sided production viewpoint of the production workshops that only focused on production and neglected transportation, and criticized the transportation departments for emphasizing insufficient equipment and other difficulties. On the basis of improving ideological understanding, the Party committee strengthened the organizational leadership of transportation work, and appointed a Party committee secretary and a deputy director to be in charge of transportation work; the Party committee and general branches included transportation work on the agenda and established professional transportation meetings between transportation and workshops to study and solve transportation problems in a timely manner. The workshops and work sections also appointed a cadre specifically to lead transportation work, and the transportation department also strengthened its leadership and added necessary dispatching agencies.
    
    The complete production perspective education that the Party committee of this plant carried out to the workers has also achieved good results. Through meetings and other forms, the workers were repeatedly explained that transportation within the plant is an important link in the factory's production; if efforts are not enough in this link, it will inevitably directly affect production. After the production workers understood the great significance of this, they put forward more than a thousand innovation suggestions in order to improve transportation work. Workers in the No. 1 steelmaking workshop suggested changing the small railway into multiple tracks and multiple switches, which accelerated the turnover of dump trucks and increased transportation efficiency by 85%. Workers in the No. 2 steelmaking workshop came up with a method of direct loading onto road vehicles, which avoided repetitive operations and saved 60% of manpower. In the past, the workshops and slag rooms were full of products and slag, and the workshop workers did not care and complained that the transportation department could not transport them out. Now they take the initiative to load and clear the trucks, ensuring that the lines around the workshops and slag rooms are unblocked. The slag loading workers in the workshops also launched a quick loading and more loading competition. Under the leadership of the workshop foreman in charge of transportation, they divided into groups, contracted trucks, and packaged, and the loading efficiency increased more than twofold. Moreover, because the loading was done well, equipment accidents caused by loading have been eliminated, greatly improving equipment utilization.
    
    The good conditions created by the production workshops greatly moved the workers in the transportation department. They were determined to improve transportation to repay the care of the production workers. In the past, when vehicles were waiting to be loaded and unloaded, the transportation personnel were afraid of "holding up the trucks" and only urged them without taking action; now the drivers, stokers, and connecting workers are afraid that the products and slag will not be transported out and affect production. As soon as they stop, they help the workshops load and unload, and the relationship between transportation and workshop workers is very close. The transportation department workers also launched a competition for more trips and faster speeds, trying every means to tap the potential of the equipment, ensuring that the transportation and loading and unloading efficiency of the entire plant is greatly improved. The external transportation of slag alone increased from more than 17,000 trucks in August to about 30,000 trucks in November, and the slag produced by steelmaking every day can be transported out on the same day.
    
    When solving the problem of insufficient transportation equipment, the plant leaders mobilized the masses to rely on their own efforts to vigorously develop indigenous and foreign-integrated transportation and loading and unloading tools and the adjustment and repair of transportation lines within the plant. The broad masses of workers broke with superstition and used indigenous methods to imitate foreign machines to make hand-cranked cranes, replacing the heavy labor of workers. They can hoist half a ton to one ton of steel at a time, and the efficiency is more than doubled compared to manual labor. Three such machines have now been made. The workers also made their own trailers, wooden hand trucks, and crowbars and other transportation tools, increasing transportation strength. The mass campaign to vigorously develop transportation construction within the plant has enabled this plant to adjust and repair ten kilometers of small railways and widen and repair one kilometer of roads this year with a small amount of materials; it has also built eight kilometers of new railways. In this way, the transportation lines for raw materials, finished products, and slag within the plant are accessible in all directions, and vehicles can be stored and loaded everywhere. The irrational phenomena of transportation have been eliminated, and the transportation system within the plant has been basically formed, preparing transportation conditions for next year's production leap forward. The formation of the transportation system within the plant has greatly improved the utilization rate of existing equipment. Last year, because there were few lines and it could not operate, three large locomotives and fifteen freight cars "squatting" in the warehouse are now being fully utilized.

    思想上重视　组织上加强　运输工人和生产工人密切配合
    唐山钢厂书记抓运输
    11月份钢产量比7月增一点八倍厂内运输适应了生产需要
    本报天津10日电　唐山钢厂领导干部与广大职工用抓生产的劲头，大办厂内运输建设。8月份以来，厂内日平均运输量由七千八百多吨提高到目前的二万三千五百多吨。11月份钢的生产水平比7月份提高了一点八倍，运输工作不但满足了生产需要，而且还清除了厂内长期积存的二万多吨渣子和废钢。
    唐山钢厂产量猛增以后，厂内运输任务十分繁重。今年8月份以前，由于少数领导干部对运输工作的重要性认识不足，只顾生产，运输工作抓得不够紧。因此，在生产不断发展的情况下，运输工作显得越来越被动。
  这个厂的党委为了根本扭转运输工作的被动局面，高速度地发展生产，组织了车间和运输部门检查批判了生产车间只抓生产忽视运输的片面生产观点，批判运输部门强调设备不足等困难。在提高思想认识的基础上，党委加强了对运输工作的组织领导，确定了一名党委书记和一名副厂长专管运输工作；党委和总支都把运输工作列入议事日程，并且建立了运输与车间的专业运输会议，及时研究解决运输中的问题。车间、工段也确定了一名专门领导运输工作的干部，运输部门也加强了领导力量，增设了必要的调度机构。
    这个厂党委向职工所进行的完整生产观点的教育，也收到了很好的效果。通过会议等形式，向工人们反复讲解了厂内运输，是工厂生产中的一个重要环节；如果在这个环节上努力不够，势必直接影响生产。生产工人在了解了这方面的重大意义后，为了改进运输工作，他们提出了一千多条革新建议。第一炼钢车间工人建议将小铁道改成多道多叉，加速了斗车周转，运输效率提高85％。第二炼钢车间工人想出了直装路用车的办法，避免了重复作业，节省了60％的人力。过去车间及渣房四周堆满产品和渣子，车间工人不管，还埋怨运输部门运不出去。现在却主动地装车、清除，保证了车间及渣房附近线路畅通。车间的装渣工人还开展了快装多装竞赛，他们在专管运输的车间工长领导下，分组分摊，包车包装，装车效率提高了二倍以上；并且由于装车装得好，由装车所引起的设备事故已经消灭，大大提高了设备利用率。
    生产车间创造的良好条件，使运输部门的职工很受感动，他们决心以搞好运输来答谢生产工人的关心。过去车辆待装待卸时，运输人员怕“压车”光催不动手；现在司机司炉、连接手，生怕产品、渣子运不出去影响生产，一停车就帮助车间装卸，运输与车间工人关系十分密切。运输部门职工还开展了多拉快跑竞赛，千方百计挖掘设备潜力，保证全厂运输装卸效率大大提高；仅外运渣子就由8月份的一万七千多车提高到11月份的三万车左右，每天炼钢出的渣子，当天就能运完。
    这个厂领导在解决运输设备不足的问题时，发动群众自力更生，大搞土洋结合的运输装卸工具和厂内运输线路的调整修建。广大职工破除了迷信，用土办法仿照洋机器制成了手摇起重机，代替了工人的笨重劳动，一次能吊装半吨到一吨钢材，效率比人工提高了二倍多。现在这种机器已经制成三台。职工们还自己制造拖车斗、木手车和撬棍等运输工具，增加了运输力量。群众性的大办厂内运输建设，使这个厂今年以来，用不多的材料，调整和修建了小铁道十公里，加宽修建了马路一公里；还新建了大铁道八公里。这样，厂内原料、成品、渣子等运输线路四通八达，处处可以存车、装车，运输不合理现象已经消灭，厂内运输体系基本形成，为明年生产跃进准备了运输条件。厂内运输体系的形成，使现有设备利用率大大提高。去年因为线路少运转不开，“蹲”在库里的三辆大机车和十五个车皮，现在也被充分利用起来。
