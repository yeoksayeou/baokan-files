Stamps Enraged Him
Yang Fan (poem), Fang Cheng (drawing)
The Greek Foreign Minister shouted in parliament: to protest against the Soviet Union's "interference in internal affairs" and "aggression against the weak." Did the Red Army occupy Mount Olympus? Did Soviet diplomats desecrate the temples of Athens? Or did the Soviet Union expand its territory to the Morea Peninsula? No, it turned out that Moscow issued a commemorative stamp of Glezos! We believe that Glezos is deeply sinful, but you regard him as a national hero; we put Glezos in prison, but you spread his deeds everywhere. The "security" of the Greek government has been seriously threatened, no wonder Mr. Averoff is indignant! The security of Greece is indeed being violated, but the threat does not come from Soviet stamps, but from the American planes that constantly circle over Athens, and the missile bases that turn Greece into a war target. The Foreign Minister wants to use stamps to divert the target, which can only make himself appear foolish and ridiculous.

On November 24, Greek Foreign Minister Averoff was furious in parliament about the Soviet Union's issuance of commemorative stamps of Glezos, and slandered the Soviet Union for "interfering in internal affairs." (Attached picture)

    邮票使他发怒
    扬帆诗　方成画希腊外交大臣在议会里大喊大叫：要抗议苏联“干涉内政”、“侵略弱小”。是红军占领了奥林匹斯山？是苏联外交官亵渎了雅典的神庙？还是苏联把版图扩展到摩里亚半岛？不，原来是莫斯科发行了格列索斯的纪念邮票！我们认定格列索斯罪孽深重，你们却把他当成民族英雄；我们把格列索斯关入监牢，你们却把他的事迹到处传颂。希腊政府的“安全”这就受到了严重威胁，难怪阿维罗夫先生要义愤填胸！希腊的安全确是受到侵扰，但威胁并不来自苏联邮票，是那些不停地在雅典上空盘旋的美国飞机，是那些把希腊变成战争靶子的导弹基地。外交大臣想用邮票来转移目标，只能使自己显得愚蠢可笑。
    11月24日，希腊外交大臣阿维罗夫在议会里竟对苏联发行纪念格列索斯的邮票暴跳如雷，诬蔑苏联“干涉内政”。（附图片）
