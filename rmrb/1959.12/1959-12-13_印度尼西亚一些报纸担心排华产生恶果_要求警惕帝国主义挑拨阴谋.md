Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 12th: Some Indonesian newspapers continue to express concern about the possible adverse consequences of the recent anti-Chinese activities in the country, and demand vigilance against imperialism, particularly the United States imperialism, which is attempting to undermine the friendly relations between Indonesia and China and Indonesia's active and independent foreign policy by inciting anti-Chinese sentiment.

　　The Indonesian-language newspaper "Sin Po" published an editorial on November 24th, pointing out that certain ill-intentioned forces in Indonesia are currently attempting to use Presidential Decree No. 10 to undermine the relations between Indonesia and China and Indonesia's active and independent foreign policy. This action is consistent with the policy that the United States has long hoped to impose on Indonesia and that the rebel group has been carrying out, which is to make Indonesia abandon its active and independent foreign policy and side with the United States. The newspaper demanded that all possibilities of using Presidential Decree No. 10 to achieve the purpose of undermining Indonesia's active and independent foreign policy be eliminated.

　　"Republik" wrote in an editorial on November 30th commenting on the anti-Chinese statement issued by the "All-Indonesia National Economic Congress" on November 25th that it feared that the terror methods adopted by Hitler against Jews and all anti-fascists would be repeated in Indonesia.

　　The newspaper pointed out that one of the leaders of the "All-Indonesia National Economic Congress" was Asaat, the head of anti-Chinese activities who had participated in the rebellion.

　　The newspaper pointed out that people are worried that this reality will trigger a new hatred movement. Those who are hated will not be limited to overseas Chinese, but also communists and all anti-fascist organizations. Those they hate are actually people who sincerely support and approve of the realization of the political declaration of the Republic of Indonesia.

　　The newspaper said that it seems that the outdated method of national hatred is still useful to those who are disappointed. They have forgotten that times have changed, and Indonesia is not in the period when Hitler possessed the greatest power in Germany.

　　The newspaper said: However, "we had better pay attention to the existence of this outdated method."

    印度尼西亚一些报纸担心排华产生恶果
    要求警惕帝国主义挑拨阴谋
    新华社12日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚的一些报纸继续对最近在这个国家内发生的排华活动可能产生的恶果表示担心，并且要求警惕帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义通过煽动反华，来破坏印度尼西亚同中国的友好关系和印度尼西亚的积极和独立的外交政策的阴谋。
    印度尼西亚文报纸“新报”11月24日发表社论指出，目前印度尼西亚的某些别有用心的势力正在企图利用第十号总统法令来破坏印度尼西亚同中国的关系和印度尼西亚的积极和独立的外交政策。这种行动是同美国长期以来希望强加于印度尼西亚身上而由叛乱集团加以执行的那种政策是一致的，那种政策就是使印度尼西亚放弃积极和独立的外交政策并倒向美国。这家报纸要求杜绝利用第十号总统法令实现破坏印度尼西亚的积极和独立外交政策的目的的一切可能性。
    “共和国报”11月30日在一篇评论“全印度尼西亚国民经济大会”11月25日发表的排华声明的社论中写道，它担心，希特勒对犹太人和一切反法西斯人士采取的恐怖手段会在印度尼西亚重演。
    这家报纸指出，“全印度尼西亚国民经济大会”的领袖之一是参加过叛乱的排华活动首脑阿萨特。
    这家报纸指出，人们担心，这种现实将会引起新的仇恨运动。受到仇视的将不只限于华侨，而且还有共产党人以及一切反法西斯组织。他们所仇恨的这些人实际上是真心支持和赞成实现印度尼西亚共和国的政治宣言的人们。
    这家报纸说，看来，民族仇恨这种过时的方法对那些失望的人仍然是有用的。他们已经忘掉，时代已经变了，而印度尼西亚并不是处于希特勒拥有最大权力时的德国所处的时期。
    这家报纸说：然而，“我们最好对这种过时的方法的存在给予注意”。
