    "Please Do Me a Favor"
     Da Ming
    Along the lush, dark green Wandashan Mountains, the Mihu Railway stretches from west to east across the vast wilderness. This simple railway, built by the pioneers of the Great Northern Wilderness themselves, has been responsible for the heavy transportation tasks of the reclamation area since the day it opened. The unforgettable story I'm about to tell happened at a small station on this railway.
    I finished my business at the farm and came to this station, preparing to take a train west from here. I walked into the building and lined up at the ticket window to buy a ticket. After standing and finally catching my breath, wiping the sweat from my face, I suddenly heard a burst of hurried footsteps from outside the door. With the sound, a student-dressed girl appeared at the entrance: medium height, round face, about twenty years old, like many young girls, with two short pigtails behind her head. She was covered in sweat, constantly panting. After entering the room, she kept wiping the sweat from her face and forehead with a handkerchief, while scanning the room with bright eyes, and then walked straight towards the ticket window.
    I bought a ticket to Mishan and walked out of the waiting room, preparing to rest for a while. As I walked to the door, the girl also hurried after me, asking me shyly:
    "Comrade! Are you going to Mishan?"
    "Yes! I'm going to Mishan to transfer trains!"
    "I have a favor to ask, I don't know if it's possible!"
    Considering that I had to wait four or five hours for a train in Mishan, I readily replied, "As long as there's enough time, I can help you."
    Hearing my promise, she looked happy, reached into her pocket, took out a handful of change, counted out six fen and handed it to me. Then she said, "A week ago, I bought a copy of 'Great Northern Wilderness' literature at the bookstore in Mishan station. The sales clerk charged me one jiao and two fen. I didn't pay attention to the price on the book at the time. Later, I happened to see on the back cover that the price was one jiao and eight fen. Was it a discounted sale this time, or did the sales clerk make a mistake? I wasn't sure myself. Later, it happened that several comrades in our team also bought 'Great Northern Wilderness,' and they all paid one jiao and eight fen. I figured the sales clerk must have made a mistake. I've been wanting to send it back to her; but I don't know her name. Then I thought, people are always coming and going at the station, so wouldn't it be easy to ask someone to take it for me? But recently, the team has been very busy with production, and it's not appropriate to ask for half a day off for this matter. Last night, I finally made up my mind and decided to come during lunch break today." She said here, glanced at her watch, as if talking to herself, and also to me: "Oh! I have to go to work in forty minutes, and I have to run more than ten li?" She smiled and said: "Then please take it to that comrade! Thank you!" After saying that, she hurried towards the newly built village on the distant hillside.
    The train arrived in Mishan after five o'clock. I was worried that the bookstore would be closed and I wouldn't be able to complete the girl's entrusted "task." I ran to the waiting room as soon as I got off the platform. After the comrade selling books heard my explanation, she put the six fen I handed over into the drawer and said excitedly, "That day after I sold the books, I calculated the accounts and found that I had undercharged for several copies of 'Great Northern Wilderness.' I hadn't had an 'accident' in two years, and I secretly blamed myself for being too careless. But strangely enough, in recent days, comrades who bought books have been sending back and mailing back the money they underpaid."

    “拜托你一件事”
     达明
    沿着葱郁黛绿的完达山，密虎铁路由西向东在莽莽的荒原上伸展。这条由北大荒建设者们自己修建起来的简便铁路，从通车那一天起，就担负了垦区繁重的运输任务。我要说的这个使我难以忘怀的故事，就发生在这条铁路的一个小车站上。
    我在农场办完了事，来到这个车站，准备从这里乘车西行。我走进屋，在售票处排队等着买票。站定后刚刚缓过一口气，揩去了脸上的汗，忽听从门外传来一阵急促的脚步声，随着声音，在门口出现了一个学生打扮的姑娘：中等个、圆圆脸、二十来岁年纪，和常见的年轻姑娘一样，脑瓜背后梳着两条不短不长的小辫。她满头是汗，口里还不住的大口喘着气。她进屋后，一边不停地用手绢擦脸上和额头上的汗，一边用明亮的目光向室内环视，接着便径直朝售票口走来。
    我买了一张去密山的车票，便走出候车室，准备休息一会。当我走到门口时，那姑娘也匆匆地跟着我走来，靦觍地向我问道：
    “同志！你是到密山去的？”
    “对！我到密山换车！”
    “拜托你一件事，不知道行不行！”
    我考虑到密山还得等四、五个小时才有车，便慨然答道：“只要时间来得及，我可以给你办。”
    她听我答应了，脸上显出高兴的样子，伸手从裤兜里掏出了一把零钱，从中间数出了六分钱递给我，接着她对我说：“一个星期以前我在密山车站售书处买了一本‘北大荒’文艺，售货员同志收了我一角二分钱。我当时也没留心书上的定价，回来后偶然看到封底上写着定价一角八分，到底是这一期减价出售呢还是售货员一时疏忽弄错了呢？自己也搞不清楚。后来恰好我们队里也有几个同志买了‘北大荒’，花的都是一角八分钱。我想准是售货员搞错了。一直惦着要给她捎回去；可寄回去呢又不知道她叫什么名字。后来想到车站上经常有人来往，顺便托人捎去不就行了。但是近来队里的生产很忙，为这事请半天假也不合适。昨天晚上一下决心，才决定今天抽午休时间来一趟。”她说到这里，匆匆地看了看手上的表，像是自言自语，又像对我说似的：“啊哟！还有四十分钟又要上班了，还得跑十多里路呢？”她笑着说：“那就烦你带去交给那位同志吧！谢谢你了！”说完她就匆匆地朝着远处山岗上新盖起来的村庄走去了。
    车到密山已经五点多钟，我深怕售书处关门完不成姑娘托付的“任务”，出了站台便连忙往候车室跑。售书的同志听我说明原委后，把我递过去的六分钱放入抽屉，兴奋的对我说：“那天我卖完书后，一算账就发现卖出的好几本‘北大荒’少算了钱，二年没出‘事故’了，心里犹暗自埋怨自己太粗心。可是说也奇怪：近几天来，买书的同志把少付的钱都陆续送回和寄回来了。”
