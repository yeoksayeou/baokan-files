    The "International Business" Group was formed around 1956. It is an organization for U.S. monopoly capital to carry out economic expansion abroad. Its members are seventy large U.S. monopoly enterprises, such as Bank of America, Chase Manhattan Bank, General Electric International, Alcoa, North American Aviation, Motorola Radio and Television, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, etc. They all have substantial investments overseas, and half of them have investments or "cooperative relationships" with Japanese enterprises.
    The main task of the "International Business" Group in its overseas activities is to expand the export of goods and investment of U.S. monopoly enterprises, hence the title "Investment Group." Since its establishment, this group has selected a country to receive investment each year and held a round table meeting there. In 1956, representatives of this group held talks with more than thirty people from the Brazilian political and business circles in Rio de Janeiro. In 1957, its representatives held talks with Italian government leaders and more than fifty people from the business community in Rome. In 1958, its representatives held talks with Argentine government officials and business figures in Buenos Aires. The previous meetings have paved the way for U.S. monopoly capital to penetrate these countries.
    This year, the "International Business" Group selected Japan as the country to hold the round table meeting, indicating that U.S. monopoly capital is about to make a major inroad into the Japanese economy. (Feng)

　　“国际商业”集团
    “国际商业”集团是在1956年前后组成的。它是美国垄断资本对外进行经济扩张的组织。其成员是美国七十家大垄断企业，如美洲银行、曼哈顿大通银行、国际通用电气公司、美国阿尔考铝业公司、北美飞机公司、莫特罗拉无线电电视公司、洛克希德飞机公司等等，都在海外有大量投资，而且其中有一半在日本投资或同日本企业有“合作关系”。
    “国际商业”集团在海外活动的主要任务，是扩大美国垄断企业的商品输出和投资，因此有“投资团”的称号。这个集团自从成立以来，每年都选定一个接受投资的国家，在那里召开圆桌会议。1956年，这个集团的代表同巴西政界和实业界人士三十余人在里约热内卢举行了会谈，1957年，它的代表同意大利政府首脑和实业界人士五十余人在罗马举行了会谈。1958年，它的代表同阿根廷政府官员及实业界人士在布宜诺斯艾利斯举行了会谈。以前的几次会谈，都为美国垄断资本向这些国家渗透开辟了道路。
    今年“国际商业”集团选定日本作为召开圆桌会议的国家，表明美国垄断资本要大举向日本经济渗入。　　（峰）
