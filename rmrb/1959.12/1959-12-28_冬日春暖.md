    The heavy snow has just cleared.
    Tractor driver Da Yang set off from the wasteland in the afternoon. As he approached the highway, dusk was falling.
    The grassland dusk after the snow was extraordinarily beautiful. The clear blue sky covered the vast white earth, and between the sky and earth appeared fiery red clouds, making everything exceptionally bright and harmonious.
    But Da Yang had no mind to admire the scenery. He rushed onto the highway and saw Lao Zhu waiting for him on his motorcycle. He was overjoyed and said, "Lao Zhu, you didn't break your promise."
    Lao Zhu said, "You are pioneering frozen land, a heroic feat that needs to be reported to the Heroes' Conference. How dare I be negligent?"
    It turned out that Lao Zhu from the motorcycle squad of the General Farm's motorcade had gone to the branch farm's political office to deliver a letter today. He happened to hear Da Yang calling the political office to report the good news, also mentioning that the track chains were worn and needed to be replaced in time. The political office consulted the Party Secretary, who decided to send Da Yang to report the good news to the General Farm's Heroes' Conference and pick up the track chains. Lao Zhu, listening attentively, happily said, "Pioneering frozen land! This is something never heard of in Northeast China. After I finish my task this afternoon, I'll drive to the intersection and take him to the General Farm."
    Now, Da Yang, wrapped in his Mongolian-style coat, sat behind Lao Zhu. The motorcycle sped along the Mishan-Hurao highway at a speed of thirty-five kilometers per hour. Traveling east from here, it would still take three hours to traverse the land of the 850 Farm!
    The wind rushed by. Da Yang shouted in Lao Zhu's ear, "Our farm is big enough, more than a million mu of land when it's all reclaimed."
    Lao Zhu responded, "With your drive to pioneer frozen land, you'll break through a million mu soon."
    Da Yang said, his eyebrows dancing, "To be honest, this thing is not simple. We increased the angle of the plowshare and lengthened the plow body, solving the problems of the plow not entering the soil and the plow blades breaking. Our machine alone has plowed five hundred mu of land after the ground froze. This good news won't be embarrassing at the Heroes' Conference, right?"
    Lao Zhu said, "Of course not. Your machines are carrying out the 1960 land reclamation task, walking ahead of time." Lao Zhu and Da Yang had been in the same motor regiment before Lao Zhu was demobilized and came to the farm. He was very happy for his comrade's new achievements.
    Da Yang continued to shout loudly, "I heard that the icebreaker manufactured in Harbin will be delivered soon, and our machines will also be transferred to the water conservancy site to dig canals. But the track chains are not good enough. A set of track chains doesn't last long before it wears out. Our farm's repair shop doesn't even try to come up with ideas for us."
    By this time, it was dark, the moon had risen, and the stars filled the sky. The snowy ground reflected a silver light, like daytime. The motorcycle sped along, leaving behind a vast expanse of snow. In this vast land, one could see piles of lights shimmering, vying with the stars in the sky. Da Yang blinked and said, "Lao Zhu, I haven't left the reclamation team for three months. The grassland looks so different again."
    Just as Da Yang was enjoying himself, he suddenly saw a four-story building in the distance, with thousands of lights shining brightly, floating on the snowy plain. This was the new building that the old farm director had led everyone to build with the old bricks dug from the former Japanese invaders' fortress. The Heroes' Conference was being held there. Da Yang urged, "Lao Zhu, speed up!" Lao Zhu didn't answer, but he was indeed increasing the throttle!
    Arriving at the entrance of the General Farm, Da Yang jumped out of the car, holding the good news report written on red paper, and ran into the auditorium. He saw the words "Mudanjiang Reclamation Bureau 850 Farm Heroes' Conference" written on the stage, and a girl with braids was speaking: "We will resolutely listen to the Party, oppose rightism, and boost our spirits. Next year, our Soybean Girls' Team will guarantee that each person manages three hundred mu of land, with an average yield of eight hundred jin per mu." Da Yang was stunned, then looked up and saw a large slogan hanging on the wall: "Step into 1960 with courageous strides, and resolutely achieve a total planting area of 910,000 mu for the whole farm!" Suddenly, a hand patted him on the shoulder. He turned around and saw Xiao Li, a fitter from the repair shop. Da Yang looked at the red stripe on his chest and said, "Good job, Xiao Li, you've become an advanced worker."
    Xiao Li smiled modestly and said, "I'm nothing. The real heroes haven't come yet! I'll tell you, our factory has produced steel! In a while, the people from the Heroes' Conference will go to see the molten steel. Old Master Yu is busy with it there!"
    Da Yang jumped up when he heard this and said, "Let's go, let's go and see it first."
    They ran to the repair shop together and saw Old Master Yu busy directing in front of the small converter.
    Da Yang approached and said happily, "Old Master Yu, you're making steel!"
    Old Master Yu saw that it was Da Yang and said, "This time, we'll make a set of medium carbon steel track chains for you. Don't complain anymore, okay?"
    Da Yang said, "It's perfect timing, our machine's track chains are broken and need to be replaced. Old Master Yu, you know that our machine has successfully pioneered frozen land, and now it's going to be transferred to work on frozen water conservancy projects!"
    "Oh," Old Master Yu's eyebrows flashed and he said, "This is great news. When do you need to go back?"
    "The sooner the better!" Da Yang said.
    "We'll pour the molten steel into molds to make track chains. We'll hurry it up for you!" Old Master Yu said resolutely.
    "My good old master!" Da Yang shouted excitedly. This good news was even happier than marrying a wife!
    Old Master Yu walked to the furnace and looked at the fire color, saying, "The molten steel is about to be tapped!" People became nervous and jubilant. After so many trials and failures, success was at hand.
    The moon rose higher and higher, the sky became even clearer and bluer, and the earth shimmered with silver light. Suddenly, a stream of fiery red heat surged straight down, flashing brightly, with sparks flying everywhere, illuminating half the sky and half the earth. Da Yang looked up and saw that the representatives from the Heroes' Conference had all come, their faces all red.
    He suddenly saw Lao Zhu standing in the crowd. He squeezed over and greeted him, "Lao Zhu, you're driving tomorrow, right? Take me back to the reclamation team."
    Lao Zhu turned to look at his friend and said with a smile, "Okay, I'll take you back tomorrow, at a speed of fifty kilometers per hour." The two friends stared at the rolling molten steel and laughed.

　　冬日春暖
　　张惟
    大雪初晴。
    拖拉机手大杨下午从荒地里动身，快跨近公路时，已将临黄昏了。
    草原雪后的黄昏，出奇的美丽，蓝湛湛的天，罩着白茫茫的大地，而在天地之间，露出了火红色的彩霞，使天地鲜耀极了，和谐极了。
    大杨却无心恋看，他奔上公路，果然看见老祝骑在摩托车上等他，大喜道：“老祝呀，你不失信。”
    老祝说：“你们破天荒地创造了顶冻开荒，要去向群英会报捷，咋敢怠慢。”
    原来总场汽车队摩托车班的老祝，今天送信到分场政治处，刚好听见大杨给政治处打电话报捷，还说链轨磨损了，要及时换。政治处请示了党委书记，确定派大杨去向总场群英会报捷，顺道去领回链轨。老祝在旁听得真切，满心高兴地说：“顶冻开荒呀，这可是关东山从来没有听见过的大事，下午任务完了我开车到路口等他，送他上总场。”
    现在，大杨裹好蒙古式大衣，坐在老祝背后，摩托车以每小时三十五公里的速度，沿着密山——虎饶公路疾驰，从这里往东行，走完850农场的土地，还需要三小时呢！
    车驰招风，大杨附在老祝耳边大声说：“我们农场真够大，全部开垦出来就有一百多万亩土地了。”
    老祝应声说：“你们顶冻开荒，这样的干劲，突破一百万亩快了。”
    大杨眉飞色舞地说：“老伙计，不瞒你说，这玩艺儿是不简单，我们把犁铲尖角度加大，加长了犁体，解决了犁不入土和犁刀损坏的问题，光是我们机车在上冻后就开了五百多亩地，这个捷报在群英会上是不会丢脸的吧。”
    老祝说：“那当然，你们机车在执行着1960年的开荒任务了，走在时间的前面。”老祝复员来到农场以前，和大杨是在一个汽车团里，他很为战友的新成绩高兴。
    大杨继续大声地说：“听说哈尔滨赶制出来的破冰机就快运来了，我们的机车还要调去水利工地挖渠，可就是链轨不好使，一副链轨经不了多少日子，就磨损坏了，咱们农场的那个修配厂呀，也不给咱们想想点子。”
    这时，天黑了，月亮升起，繁星满空，雪地泛起银光，如同白昼。摩托车飞驰，把大片雪原一甩而过，这辽阔的土地上，时时看见一堆堆灯光闪闪，与天上的星星争辉。大杨眨了眨眼睛说：“老祝呀，三个月没有走出开荒队，草原的模样又大变了。”
    大杨正乐着，忽然远远地望见，一座四层大楼，千百盏灯齐明，通亮通亮，浮现在雪原上。这就是老场长领着大伙挖当年日本侵略军要塞的旧砖建起来的新大楼了，群英大会就在那里举行。大杨催道：“老祝，加快呀！”老祝没有回答，其实，他自己正加大了油门呢！
    到达总场门口，大杨跳下车，手中拿着红纸写的报捷书，跑进大礼堂去，只见台上写着：“牡丹江农垦局850农场群英大会”，一个梳着辫子的姑娘正在发言：“我们坚决听党的话，反右倾，鼓干劲，明年我们大豆姑娘班保证每人管理三百亩地，平均亩产八百斤。”大杨听了一楞，猛抬头，见墙上挂着一条大标语：“以勇猛的步伐跨入1960年，坚决实现全场播种面积九十一万亩！”忽然背后有一只手往他肩上一拍，他回头一望，见是修配厂的钳工小李，大杨看着他胸前的红条子说：“好呀，小李子，当上先进分子了。”
    小李谦逊地笑了笑说：“我算不了什么，真正的英雄还没有来呢！告诉你，咱们厂出钢了，待会儿群英大会的人都要去看出钢水，老余师傅正在那里摆弄呢！”
    大杨一听，跳将起来说：“走，咱们先去看看。”
    他们一起奔到修配厂，见老余师傅正在小转炉前忙着指挥。
    大杨挨近前欣喜地说：“老余师傅，你们都炼钢了！”
    老余师傅见是大杨，说道：“这下子给你们打副中炭钢的链轨，别再叨咕了吧。”
    大杨说：“正赶巧，我们机车的链轨坏了，要换新的，老余师傅，你知道我们机车顶冻开荒成功了，现在又要调去顶冻修水利呢！”
    “哦，”老余师傅眉毛一闪说：“这可是大喜事，你多咋要回去？”
    “越快越好！”大杨说。
    “这炉钢水灌模就打造链轨，我们给你赶！”老余师傅坚决地说。
    “我的好老师傅！”大杨兴奋地喊将起来，这喜讯真比娶个媳妇还快乐呢！
    老余师傅走到炉前看了看火色，说声：“快出钢水了！”人们紧张起来，一片欢腾。多少次的尝试和失败，眼看成功就在面前了。
    月亮越升越高，天越发蓝湛湛的了，大地银光闪亮。骤然，一股火红的暖流，汹涌直泻，闪着强光，火花四溅，映红了半边天，半边地。大杨一抬头，看见群英会的代表们都来了，一个个脸孔都映得通红通红。
    他忽然看见老祝也站在人堆里，他挤过去，招呼道：“老祝，你明天出车吧！带我回开荒队。”
    老祝回头望了望他的朋友，笑说：“好，我明天送你回去，时速五十公里。”两个朋友凝望着滚滚的钢水都乐了。
