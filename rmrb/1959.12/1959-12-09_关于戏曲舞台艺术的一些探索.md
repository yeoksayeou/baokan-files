Some Explorations on the Art of the Traditional Opera Stage
　　A Jia

Traditional opera is one of China's precious cultural treasures. Its popularity among the masses is not solely due to its long tradition, but mainly because it contains positive elements. These positive elements express the Chinese working people's democratic spirit against feudal oppression, their patriotic spirit against national aggression, and their moral spirit of being incorruptible by wealth, unshakable by poverty, and unyielding to force.

Chinese opera has a long history. It is an art that originated in feudal society, but since the audience of stage art is the broad masses, it inevitably reflects the thoughts and feelings of the working people to a certain extent. Of course, in any era, the ideas of the ruling class are the ruling ideas. Opera is also inevitably influenced by the feudal ruling class. This is clearly manifested in the dross parts of some plays, such as those that promote feudal ideas and erotic and terrifying performances, which must be opposed. However, due to the contradictions between the exploiting class and the exploited class, the working people have to speak for their own interests, express their wishes, and express their views, sometimes even unconsciously. They range from reflecting the life contradictions around them to exploring and exposing the contradictions in the political life of the rulers; they bravely accuse tyranny, expose treacherousness, uphold justice, and maintain goodness, with generous scolding, wise debates, sharp satire, and humorous self-deprecation. They express every emotion, all becoming artistic prose. The main characteristics of the Chinese working people's character, as reflected in opera, always use the spirit of optimism to encourage their fighting spirit and break free from their tragic fate. Many plays express the people's ideal of pursuing freedom and happiness, their adherence to the fighting spirit of speaking out for justice, and their praise of the virtue of self-sacrifice; they are irreconcilable with oppressors and help the oppressed with their swords. This strong feeling of longing for freedom and love for the motherland is essentially a tortuous and concentrated expression of the people's life and thought.

While inheriting traditional culture and art, we should naturally correctly estimate the influence of the ideological viewpoints of the feudal ruling class, which requires us to analyze and criticize them. We must eliminate the distorted images and reactionary thoughts on the opera stage. For a long time, those parasitic classes, in order to satisfy their low-level entertainment, have made jokes and sought pleasure, which have soiled the people's heritage. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate the dross and absorb the essence, scraping off the dirt from this treasure and polishing it so that it can emit brilliance and serve socialism.

Art is not a copy of life. The material used in art to represent life, no matter how good the conditions are, cannot reproduce the myriad aspects of real life. In its presentation, Chinese opera often uses methods such as substituting the virtual for the real, the simple for the complex, conveying truth through spirit, and achieving more with less to solve this contradiction. The stage reality it presents is different from that of spoken drama. Spoken drama and opera have commonalities in the creative principles of stage art, both requiring concentration, refinement, exaggeration, and simplicity; but the techniques each have their own clever differences. For example, the reality of a spoken drama stage, within a given situation, whether it is the environment or life, must conform to the logic of real life. If the stage is set up as an interior scene, it cannot simultaneously be an exterior scene. People's activities and the scene have a strict constraint relationship. The characters' actions and stage scheduling, no matter how ingenious the artistic processing, must strictly comply with the laws of life, living in the role like in real life, and acting in the fictional given situation. The reality of the opera stage has its own interpretation. Although the specific environment of opera also relies on a certain degree of stage setting to express it, the main feature is relying on the performance of the actors. It expresses the logic of life in a special stage logic. When you master the freedom of stage space and time, you can truly enjoy the vastness of the universe and observe the abundance of everything, indulging in the pleasure of sight and hearing. On this small stage, seven or eight people can be thousands of troops and horses, and three or five steps can be wading through water and climbing mountains. Why use this method? The purpose is to more freely express the huge events and passions in the struggle of life, to educate the people themselves. The methods and styles of artistic expression can be diverse and can show their own unique abilities. Chinese opera shines as a genre in the world of dramatic art. It is an expression of the high creativity of the Chinese working people. Some people say that the stage art of Chinese opera does not seem to be created according to the laws of objective life. I have a different view. Don't think that the character walks a circular stage for hundreds of miles and sings a slow aria for half the night, that this creative method is idealist. I think that how art grasps real life, the important thing is how to objectively understand it. As for the expression, each has its own special means. Otherwise, the characteristics of art would be lost. Of course, due to the strengths and limitations of artistic means, one should also have one's own perspective when expressing a common life object.

Opera and spoken drama each have their own tricks for how to arrange dramatic conflicts when expressing the same theme on the same subject matter. Some plots are difficult to perform in spoken drama, but can be shown to great advantage in opera. The unity of the contradiction between art and life also depends on our artistic imagination and aesthetic experience. It is not possible to grasp the reality of art with isolated feelings. Although we regard the various things on the stage as the reality of life, this feeling carries a kind of signal. No matter how realistic the things on the stage are in appearance, we always feel it with some imagination. Otherwise, why is the stage facing the audience empty, which you cannot explain.

The reality of stage art can only be hypothetical. On this point, the spoken drama and opera stages are the same, the only difference being the form, degree, and method of the assumption. It cannot be said that only a stage with a real image is real, and a virtual image must be unreal. The reality of the stage, if it does not arise from the connection of feelings, is unimaginable. For example, we can only feel the truth of the mountains on the scenery with vision and visual association, and cannot feel the truth of it with touch; we can only feel the fragrance of the flowers in the props with vision and visual association, and cannot feel the fragrance of it with smell. Chinese painters often say, "Paint flowers to paint their fragrance, paint water to paint its sound"; the acquisition of this "fragrance" and "sound" is of course first of all that the objective work is painted successfully, but it cannot be obtained without the aesthetic feeling of the appreciator. When people have the ability to associate and reason, they do not have to sprinkle perfume on the drawing paper to get the fragrance of orchids, and they do not have to inject cold air on the stage to get the cold of wind and snow. According to Marx's explanation, "Colored marble cannot have the attributes of a physiological body outside the fields of painting and sculpture." It can be seen that the muscular feeling of the human body in sculpture is given by the artist, not by the marble. You can only look at it, not touch it, and it will be disheartening to touch it. The reason why it is false when touched is to explain the limitation of the visual organs; the reason why it is true when seen is to explain the role of the comprehensive activities of the visual organs and other sensory organs. It can be seen that the appreciation of that hard marble statue, which can evoke a beauty of muscular softness, warmth, elasticity, and vitality, not only relies on the power of people's vision, but also on the power of imagination and thinking. People's perception of art is a complex thinking activity, with imagery association and logical judgment. For this reason, art can reflect reality without having to show everything, can know the whole leopard from a spot, and feel the divine dragon by watching the clouds; it can be freehand, it can be vivid, it can be deformed, and it can be discolored. Therefore, Su Dongpo has the right: he can draw bamboo with vermilion pen, or he can draw bamboo with ink pen; when Qi Baishi paints shrimp swimming, he can paint water, or he can not paint water; Chinese painters can use the outlining method or the boneless method for the same peony; they can use focal perspective or scattered perspective for the same landscape; if only the physical eyes are allowed to be used, and the imaginative eyes are not allowed to be used, then the long scroll paintings "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" and "A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains" collected in the Forbidden City could not have been produced. Of course, this artistic feature is not necessarily unique to Chinese traditional art, but it has achieved rich development in many aspects in Chinese traditional art. This aspect is worth studying to see which ones can be inherited. That kind of art that can only imitate life can only be lower than life, and can only be dull and lackluster life photography. In opera art, a wooden oar can perform stormy waves; a few whips can perform galloping horses. These performances, of course, require a high degree of skill, but not to show off skills, but to use the limited stage space to express the infinite picture of life. The ancients wrote poems on Xiangyang map: Books are empty in a small size, and the meaning of thousands of miles is leisurely. The Chinese opera stage has a feeling of "a thousand miles in a small size."

II

Understanding Chinese opera performance is very helpful by starting with studying the special laws of space and time on the opera stage. This relatively free spatial and temporal stage treatment determines that the stage is in the form of scenes, basically not in the form of acts. The basic difference between acts and scenes is that the characteristic of acts is in a limited stage field, according to the specific environment and specific situation created by artists (including authors, directors, actors, musicians, and artists, etc.) for the role, they can act according to the life logic of the role. The performer creates according to the form of real life, so he can only obey the limitations of the living environment created by the specific stage conditions. The characteristic of scenes is that the specific environment of this role is mainly not expressed by stage setting, but by the performance of the actors; therefore, it is less restricted by the stage field (space and time), but can freely create this dramatic situation. Therefore, scenes and acts are not distinguished by whether the curtain falls or not, but by the method of performance.

The form of scenes (up and down scenes) and the free handling of stage space and time are inseparable, and the virtual techniques in performance are inseparable. As long as the relationship between stage space and time is mainly fixed not by performance but by real scenery, then a series of opera performance techniques will be damaged to a certain extent. This special stage treatment of opera has formed its own relatively complete set of laws in long-term practice; these laws can be explained by the law of unity of opposites. For example:

One, freedom and rigor - the change of space and time on the opera stage, it shows the change of the specified situation. This change is revealed in the opera performance by the specific actions of the actors; otherwise, the so-called freedom of space and time is abstract and elusive. Here, the more rigorous the actor's body movements (should include psychological physical movements), the more understandable and credible the changes in life and the living environment are; it also proves that the actor's mastery of the relationship between stage space and time is more free. For example, if the two actors playing the old boatman in "Autumn River" and Chen Miaochang do not have a rigorous structure of virtual movements and the posture is not accurate, they will not be able to show the risk of the autumn river and the scene of the small boat following the waves, and they will not be able to show the different situations and moods of the old boatman and Chen Miaochang. Whenever suddenly climbing mountains and wading through water, suddenly galloping on the battlefield, suddenly fighting in the dark night, and suddenly staggering in the wind and snow, it is impossible to achieve such changes in the living environment shown by the high degree of control of the freedom of stage space and time if the actor's stage movements are not rigorously mastered. Opera actors are very strict with physical training. How to use hand, eye, body, method, and step techniques in a related way is the most basic technique for opera actors. The rigor of action is not only a matter of technique and structure, but must also require the true rationality of both life and art, which is inseparable from experience. When stage life is rational and the technique is rigorous, it is easy to handle and everything is at ease. As Shen Zongqian of the Qing Dynasty said in his discussion of painting: "The ultimate in proficiency, without thinking, comes out naturally, and then it can be collected into a ruler's width, released as a curtain, indulgent as unrestrained, and restrained as meticulous, without seeking to be so but naturally without not being so." Wang Gai also said: "Only by first measuring strictly can we then transcend and change, and the ultimate in law is to return to lawlessness." This is the same principle as the relationship between rigor and freedom on the opera stage.

Two, connection and independence - the relationship between connection and independence is very enlightening for understanding opera performance. Without independence in connection, there would be no clear modeling on the stage. For example, when the stage shows fighting, whether it is two people fighting, or three people fighting, there are always both responses and independent postures. Even if there are as many as eight or ten joint actions (group fighting scenes), if there is no relatively independent performance, it is impossible to carry out connected collective performances. Please see Gai Jiaotian's body movements, which are not only connected like a thread, but also have many points to distinguish and interrupt them. When he expresses a heroic character in emotional agitation, the silk hat on his head, the beard on his mouth, the large belt around his waist, and the whip in his hand all fly up at the same time, so that you can't see where it starts and where it ends; you can't find a single gap. However, it does not make you dizzy, but it clearly explains the different stunts of shaking the beard, kicking the big belt, straightening the silk hat, and brushing the whip, and each one is seen clearly. Put together, it leaves you with the graceful and vigorous image of a hero. Old artists pay attention to appearance, posing, squatting, and changing styles, which means independence in connection; they also pay attention to echoing and looking around, following the host and guest, and the whole stage is a vegetable... etc., which means connection in independence. On the stage, they are most afraid of hard mountains and gables, which is to oppose independence without connection, and they are afraid of smooth sides, which is to oppose connection without independence. For example, if you look to the left, first point to the right, if you look down, first focus on the top; movement with stillness, chaos with order, these are the laws of connection and independence on the opera stage.

Three, omission and concentration - Chinese painting pays attention to the laws of sparseness and density, gathering and dispersing, detailed and concise, thick and light, and opera performance pays special attention to this. It does not require rationality everywhere in a cumbersome way, seeking the logic of life; but it makes way to free up hands to solve important dramatic conflicts. For example, in the three explorations of "The Empty City Stratagem," the concept of time for the scouts and the specific situation of the enemy's advance are not detailed, but only say that Sima's large army is forty miles away from Xicheng. In one sentence, the play is concentrated on expressing Kong Ming's passion after correctly judging the enemy's situation and having to make a decisive decision but being helpless. For example, in "The Heroes' Gathering," Zhou Yu and Kong Ming drink wine while sitting opposite each other. These places strive to be omitted and do not seek the truth (opera stages never eat dishes when inviting guests, they only say that the banquet is set), but the play is concentrated on Zhou Yu's inner struggle with Kong Ming, harboring the psychology of hatred and killing but only being able to restrain himself. For example, ten thousand people are fighting, only a few scenes are used, only as an explanation of an event; while Gao Chong loses his horse in the battle, the performer does a lot of work on the stage to show how the hero overcomes difficulties in danger and bravely pursues and kills the enemy. For example, when Song Jiang is looking for a book, when he finds the recruitment bag, he searches and does not see it, suddenly turns the bottom of the bag over, staring at it with both eyes, as if to see into the seam of the cloth. This artistic creation that highlights the psychological image is more than ten times exaggerated than life; but writing letters or writing articles on the stage, although there are thousands of words, takes less than half the time. The structure of the scene is also the same. Some scenes are very large, but the plot is simple, expressing the psychological contradictions of the characters and rendering them very richly; some scenes are very small, but they explain many events, just lightly describe them and pass them by.

Four, reality and virtuality - virtual action is an important feature of opera performance, which cannot be separated from the special handling of stage space and time, but virtuality is not unconditional, and often requires a certain reality to help performance. Zhang Fei's horse can be virtual, but the spear in his hand cannot be virtual; Sun Yujiao's threading the needle when embroidering flowers can be virtual, but the jade bracelet for picking up the jade bracelet cannot be virtual; the battlefield environment can be virtual, but one knife and one shot when two generals fight cannot be virtual; the doors, windows, and stairs in the room can be virtual, but the tables and chairs cannot be virtual. There are also very special examples. Look at the willow opera "Playing the Club and Jumping the Boat." A scholar is tired from shopping. He moves a stone on the side of the road. This is performed with virtual action; this is not enough, he also lifts up his clothes, raises one leg, and sits on the virtual stone to doze off. This action is very good-looking, and the degree of virtuality can be regarded as thorough, but the foot of this life still cannot leave the stage, which shows that absolute virtuality does not exist. The mutual relationship between virtuality and reality does not have to be mechanically stipulated, and should be studied after looking at the specific techniques. If reality becomes a necessary condition for virtuality, it must be used. Real objects such as wooden oars and horse whips are meaningless without human performance and cannot really represent anything; when they are combined with performance, the situation of rowing boats and galloping horses immediately appears. Reality and virtuality are not opposed. Therefore, thinking about how opera can organically use the scenery is not a problem that cannot be solved.

Opera performances are rich and colorful. This is just exploring some basic laws. In fact, these laws are not unique to opera art, but opera art expresses them most prominently. These special laws are a summary reflection of the traditional aesthetic thought of the Chinese people on stage art. Creating this refined and harmonious style is to express the struggle of life more concentratedly.

III

Here, we should especially talk about one of the most important issues in opera performance, that is, the issue of the method of experience on the opera stage, which is also the issue of the combination of realism and romanticism in opera performance art.

Musicians, artists, and sculptors, when creating after experiencing life, express it with their own special materials, such as notes, colors, and plaster, but only when actors experience life and create, their own body is both the material and the work; it combines the creator, material, and work into one. Therefore, the psychology and the physical body are consistent in the experience, and a series of psychological perception processes and a series of technical embodiment processes should also be consistent; experience and expression cannot be separated. The expression form of Chinese opera is an art form that uses the traditional aesthetic method to express the Chinese way of life through the stage. When it comes to experience, it has its own methods, and this experience method is restricted by the stage laws mentioned above.

In the past, opera actors had a very wide range of observation and experience of life, not limited to people's words and deeds. Everything from charming and unrestrained figures in paintings, vigorous and graceful sculptures, to the posture of kites flying and fish leaping, tigers roaring and dragons soaring, must be observed, imitated, and their spirit captured. This kind of thing is kneaded into a special technique and applied to one's own body. This is the foundation of the "body posture" of the opera stage. The old artist Gai Jiaotian even understood the momentum of dance movements in the swirling smoke. This is not being divorced from life, but paying attention to observing various phenomena to enrich one's own image conception. This aspect can also be used for our reference.

First train the basic body postures of the actors well, even train the basic expression forms and language forms well, and then deeply experience the role (there is also experience when observing things before, not necessarily the experience of a specific role), and then melt these things from the personality of the role. This is the special experience method of Chinese opera performance art. It is like this: first accept the technology formed by the predecessors from the extensive life experience, and when creating, then digest, criticize and enrich it from one's own specific experience. Some people have other views, thinking that as long as there is the actor's enthusiasm and immersion in the role, the role of the opera stage can be born, thinking that as long as there are actions that conform to the logic of life, there can be actions that conform to the logic of the opera stage. Relatively emphasize experience, and less research on expression (there is a debate between the experience school and the expression school in spoken drama stage art), this is of course also a method, but I personally think that the emotion of the opera stage is by no means equal to the emotion of life. It is something that has been colored, rendered, and played with music by life emotion. It is the poetization of life emotion. If the emotion of an opera actor has not been transformed into a kind of technology, then when he goes on stage, the more abundant the emotion, the more he will make a fool of himself. Just imagine, on the opera stage, in the midst of gongs and drums, singing and dancing, if one of the actors suddenly sheds tears of great emotion due to the real experience of life, wouldn't that be a big embarrassment? This shows that the emotion of the opera stage must have exquisite design and must have the nature of expression, and it is not enough to be limited to the level of life experience. But life experience is always the source, and with a good technical design, if there is no deep experience, it is just a puppet-like cleverness.

In fact, for the stage art of any genre, according to its nature, the so-called experience and expression cannot be absolutely separated. The role must be analyzed and experienced by the actor's thoughts and emotions, the so-called "putting yourself in the other's shoes", so it is impossible not to have experience; the actor only acts in a hypothetical living environment and fictional events, the so-called "making a false play real", so it is impossible not to have expression. Of course, it is meaningful to treat it as a scientific creative method and distinguish between the two. So, what is the creation situation of the opera stage? I think it is like this: opera actors should have these two kinds of materials, one is their own emotion, which is the fuel for casting the role; the other is the basic stage technology (the basic skills of singing, doing, reciting, and fighting), which is the steel for casting the role; the actor burns his own enthusiasm in the furnace of the specified situation, and dissolves these steels into the role. This is the special experience method and nature of opera performance art. It is not enough for opera actors to rely on the release of life passion without mastering the technology. They should often train their sensory organs, training them like musical instruments, and then they can use their passion to play the heart song of the role. There is a contradiction between using opera technology and deeply experiencing life. The contradiction is manifested in: experience must be given form by technology but also break through this form, technology must be given content by experience but also restrain this content. This contradictory movement makes the opera art achieve the unity of strong expression and deep experience, and the unity of clear sense of form and realism. The special method of opera experience also lies in the understanding of the connecting line of action. For example, spoken drama, as long as it allows things to go on stage (referring to props, scenery, etc., naturally including actions) are required to be reasonable; this rationality must be the life logic that conforms to the form of real life, although it has been processed on the stage. Opera experience is different. It is reasonable according to its own special laws. It is impossible to be reasonable according to the connecting action of real life to have one round stage for dozens of miles and eight supporting roles for hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

Our purpose in studying the special laws of opera art and its experience methods is to develop it in new conditions so that it can better reflect the historical reality of life and the reality of today's life, rather than sticking to the old ways and being complacent. Since it is a national form, if it is only good at reflecting historical life (only the feudal society) and not good at reflecting today's life, this is illogical. However, we want to learn the characteristics of opera art, but these characteristics are contradictory to expressing today's life. The more abundant treasures there are in the opera performance art and the more distant it is from today's life, how to take its essence and discard its dross so that it can play a positive role in reflecting socialist life, this task must be completed well. The Marxist aesthetic principle is not to appreciate beauty away from life. Therefore, when opera expresses current life, the characteristics of traditional forms are bound to change. The specificity of any art form is determined both by the special artistic means and more by life. Saying this does not mean that there is any disregard for inheriting tradition. Our view has always been that there is a restrictive relationship between old forms and new content. Accepting traditional forms starts from specific life, and the characteristics of life determine the characteristics of art, but it must also be admitted that each art form is always limited in its special means to reflect life. Without understanding this relationship, we cannot correctly understand the relationship between inheriting tradition and developing tradition. The development of opera forms should learn from spoken drama and other fraternal arts. It must change and innovate. Blindly conserving is wrong, but it must always be different from other stage arts and exist uniquely.

Under the guidance of the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," the development of Chinese opera is in the most prosperous era in history, especially the new forces, which have unlimited potential. The buds have already appeared. In our garden, strange and dazzling flowers that cannot be compared to any historical era are blooming.

    关于戏曲舞台艺术的一些探索
    阿甲
    戏曲是我国宝贵的文化财富之一，它所以为群众喜闻乐见，不仅仅因为它传统久，主要是在于它含有积极的因素，这些积极因素表现了中国劳动人民反对封建压迫的民主精神，反对民族侵略的爱国主义精神，以及那种富贵不能淫、贫贱不能移、威武不能屈的道德精神。
    中国戏曲历史悠久，它是封建社会所产生的艺术，但是舞台艺术的对象既是广大群众，就不可能不在一定程度上反映劳动人民的思想感情。当然，在任何时代中，统治阶级的思想都是统治着的思想。戏曲也必然受到封建统治阶级的影响。这在一部分剧目中，那些宣传封建思想以及色情恐怖等表演的糟粕部分，表现得很明显，这是必须加以反对的。可是由于剥削阶级和被剥削阶级的矛盾，劳动人民不得不为自己的利害关系，诉说自己的愿望，抒发自己的感情，表达自己的观点，有的时候那怕是不自觉的。他们从反映自身周围的生活矛盾，一直到探讨和揭露统治者政治生活的矛盾；他们勇敢地控诉强暴，揭发奸邪，伸张正义，维护善良，有慷慨的笑骂，有明智的辩论，有辛辣的讽刺，有幽默的解嘲，真是喜笑怒骂，皆成文章。中国劳动人民性格的主要特征，反映在戏曲中的，总是以乐观主义的精神来鼓励他们的斗志，挣脱他们的悲剧命运的。不少剧目中表现了人民追求自由幸福的理想，坚持仗义执言的斗志，颂扬舍己为人的美德；对压迫者不共戴天，对被压迫者拔剑相助。像这种渴望自由、热爱祖国的强烈的感情，本质上都是人民的生活思想曲折而集中的表现。
    在承继传统文化艺术的同时，自然应该正确地估计到封建统治阶级思想观点的影响，这就需要我们来分析批判。我们必须清除戏曲舞台上的歪曲形象和反动思想。长期以来，那些寄生阶级为了满足于低级趣味的消遣作噱、戏谑寻欢，已经弄脏了人民的遗产，因而，必须剔除糟粕，汲取精华，将这蒙了尘垢的珍宝刮垢磨光，使它放出珠光宝彩，为社会主义服务。
    一
    艺术不是生活的复制，艺术表现生活所使用的物质材料，尽管条件再好，也不能复制出森罗万象的现实生活的。中国戏曲在表现上，往往用以虚拟实、以简略繁、以神传真、以少胜多的手法来解决这个矛盾。它所表现的舞台真实，和话剧不同。话剧和戏曲在舞台艺术的创作原则上是有共同性的，都要求集中、洗炼、夸张、单纯；而手法则各有巧妙不同。比如话剧舞台的真实，既在规定情境之中，无论是环境和生活，都必须合乎现实生活的逻辑。舞台上如布置的是内景，就不能同时又是外景，人的活动和景有严格的制约关系。角色的动作和舞台调度，不管有多么巧妙的艺术处理，但严格要求遵守生活的规律，要像生活里一样生活在角色里，行动在虚构的规定情境里。戏曲舞台的真实，有它自己的解释，戏曲的特定环境，虽也靠一定程度的舞台装置来表现，但主要的特征是依靠演员的表演。它是在特殊的舞台逻辑中表现生活的逻辑的，当你掌握了舞台空间、时间的自由时，真让你游目骋怀，仰观宇宙之大，俯察品类之盛，极视听之娱。在这小小舞台，七八人可以是千军万马，三五步可以是涉水登山。为什么要用这种手法呢？其目的是为了更自由地去表现生活斗争中巨大的事件和激情，以教育人民自己。艺术的表现方法和风格是可以多种多样的，可以各显神通。中国戏曲在世界戏剧艺术中作为一个流派而散发自己的光辉。它是中国劳动人民高度的创造力的表现。有人这样说，中国戏曲的舞台艺术，好像不是按照客观生活法则创造的。我的看法不同。不要以为角色在舞台上，走一个圆场百十里，唱一段慢板五更天，就以为这种创作方法是唯心主义的。我觉得艺术如何把握现实生活，重要的在于如何客观地去认识它。至于表现，则各有自己的特殊手段。不然，艺术的特点就没有了。当然，由于艺术手段的特长和限制，表现共同的生活对象时也应有自己的角度的。
    戏曲和话剧，对表现同一题材同一主题，戏剧冲突如何安排，都有自己的窍门。有些情节在话剧很难演戏，在戏曲则可大显身手。艺术和生活这个矛盾之所以能统一，也有赖于我们的艺术想像和审美经验。对艺术的真实，用孤立的感觉去捉摸是不行的，舞台上那些形形色色的东西，我们虽然把它当作生活的真实去感觉它，但这种感觉是带有一种信号作用的。不管舞台上的玩艺在外貌上多么逼真，我们感受时总是带些想像的。否则，当着观众一面的舞台，为什么空在那里，就叫你无法解释。
    舞台艺术的真实，只能是假定性的。在这一点上，话剧和戏曲舞台都是一样，所区别的只是假定的形式、程度、手法不同而已。不能说只有有实物形象的舞台才是真实的，虚拟的形象就一定是不真实的。舞台的真实，如果不是产生于感觉的联系那是不可设想的。譬如说：我们对布景上的山，我们只能以视觉和视觉的联想去感觉它的真，不能以触觉去感觉它的真；对道具里的花，也只能以视觉和视觉联想去感觉它的香，不能以嗅觉去感觉它的香。中国画家常谓“绘花绘其馨，绘水绘其声”；这个“馨”和“声”的获得，当然首先是客观的作品画得成功，但是，如果没有鉴赏者审美的感觉那也是得不到的。人们有了联想和推理的能力，就可以不必在画纸上洒香水而得芝兰之香，不必在舞台上灌冷气而得风雪之寒。据马克思的解释，“色彩的大理石都不能在绘画和雕塑领域之外具有生理形体的属性”。可见，雕塑中人体的肌肉感，是艺术家赋予的，不是大理石赋予的。对它，只能看，不能动手摸，一摸就寒心。其所以一摸就假，这是说明视觉器官的限制；其所以一看就真，这是说明视觉器官和其余感觉器官综合活动的作用。足见鉴赏者对那座硬棒棒的大理石塑像，而能引起一种肌肉的柔和、温润、弹性、活力的美感的，不止是靠人们视觉的力量，也要靠想像和思维的力量的。人对艺术的感受，是一种复杂的思维活动，有形象的联想，有逻辑的判断。由于这个原因，艺术反映现实，就可以不必和盘托出，可以窥一斑而知全豹，望腾云而感神龙；可以写意，可以传神，可以变形，可以变色。于是苏东坡就有权利：既可以用朱笔画竹，也可以用墨笔画竹；齐白石画虾子游泳，可以画水，也可以不画水；国画家对同一枝牡丹，既可用勾勒法，也可用没骨法；对同一种风景，既可用焦点透视，也可用散点透视；如果只准从物理的眼睛出发，不准用想像的眼睛出发，那么，故宫收藏的长卷画“清明上河图”和“万里江山图”就不可能产生。当然这种艺术特征不一定是中国传统艺术所独有，但是在中国传统艺术里取得了多方面的丰富的发展。这一方面值得我们去研究，看哪一些是可以承继的。那种只能对生活模仿的艺术也只能低于生活，只能是黯淡无光的生活摄影。在戏曲艺术里，一条木桨，可以表演惊涛骇浪；几根鞭子，可以表演万马奔腾。这些表演，固然要高度的技巧，但不是为了炫耀技巧，而是利用有限的舞台空间，表现无限的生活图景。古人题襄阳图诗云：图书空咫尺，千里意悠悠。中国的戏曲舞台，就有“尺幅千里”之感。
    二                                            
    理解中国戏曲表演，从研究戏曲舞台的空间和时间的特殊规律入手很有帮助。这种比较自由的空间和时间的舞台处理，决定舞台以分场的形式，基本上不是分幕的形式。分幕和分场的基本区别在于：分幕的特点是在有限制的舞台领域，根据艺术家（包括作者、导演、演员和音乐、美术家等）为角色创造的具体环境具体情况下，能按照角色的生活逻辑去行动。扮演者，是依据现实生活的形式来创作的，所以只能服从特定的舞台条件所创造的生活环境的限制。分场的特点在于对这个角色的规定情境，主要地不是由舞台布置来帮助表现，而是由演员的表演来表现；因此，它就比较不受舞台领域（空间时间）的限制，而是可以自由地创造这种戏剧的情境。因此，分幕分场，并不以落幕与否为区分，而是以表演的方法来区分。
    分场（上下场）的形式和舞台空间、时间的自由处理是无法分开的，和表演上虚拟手法是无法分开的。只要舞台空间、时间的关系主要地不是由表演而是由实景把它固定了，那戏曲一系列的表演手法都要受到一定程度的破坏。戏曲这种特殊的舞台处理，在长期的实践中形成了自己一套比较完整的规律；这些规律都可以用对立统一的法则来解释它。例如：
    一，自由和谨严——戏曲舞台空间、时间的变化，它是表明规定情境的变化。这种变化，在戏曲表演上是靠演员的具体动作来揭示它；否则，所谓空间、时间的自由都是抽象的、不可捉摸的。这里，演员的身段工架（应该是包括心理的形体动作）越是谨严，那所表现出的生活和生活环境的变化就越能使人理解、可信；也就证明这个演员掌握舞台空间、时间的关系更能自由。比如说：扮演“秋江”中老梢翁和扮演陈妙常的两个演员在表演时，如果虚拟动作的结构不严密，姿势不准确，就表现不出秋江的风险和那只小船随波逐浪的情景，也就表现不出那个老梢翁和陈妙常两人不同的处境和心情。举凡忽而登山涉水，忽而驰骋疆场，忽而在黑夜搏斗，忽而在风雪踉跄，似这种高度控制了舞台空间时间的自由所表现出的生活情境的变化，如果演员的舞台动作掌握得不谨严，那是办不到的。戏曲演员对形体训练十分严格，如何有联系地运用手、眼、身、法、步技术是戏曲演员最基本的技术。动作的谨严，不只是指技法、结构的问题，而必须要求生活和艺术两者真实的合理，这就离不开体验。舞台生活合理，技法谨严，那就得心应手，无不自如。正如清朝沈宗骞论画说：“纯熟之极，无事思虑而出之自然，而后可敛之为尺幅，放之为目幛，纵则为狂逸，收则为谨细，不求如是而自无不如是。”王概也说：“惟先渠度森严，而后超神尽变，有法之极，归于无法。”这和戏曲舞台上谨严和自由的关系乃是一个道理。
    二，联系和独立——联系和独立的关系，对理解戏曲的表演有很大的启发。没有联系中的独立，舞台上就不会有鲜明的造型。比如舞台上表现打仗，无论是两人对打、三人交锋，总是既有呼应又有独立的姿态的。多至八股挡、十股挡（群打场面），如果没有相对的独立的表演，也就不可能进行有联系的集体表演。请看盖叫天的身段动作，既像一根线那样贯串，又有许多点把它区别、顿断。当他表现一位英雄人物在感情激荡时，从头上的罗帽、嘴上的髯口、腰间的大带、手中的马鞭，同时都飞舞起来，使你看不出从何处起，何处落；找不到一点空隙。可是，它不是叫你看得眼花撩乱，而是甩髯口、踢大带、挺罗帽、刷马鞭，都交代得清清楚楚，而且每一样都看到不同的特技。综起来给你留下那个婀娜而又刚健的英雄形象。老艺人很讲究出场、亮相、蹲势、换式等，这是说联系中的独立；又讲究呼应顾盼、宾主相从、全台一棵菜……等，这是讲独立中的联系。舞台动作上，他们最忌硬山搁檩，这是反对没有联系的独立，忌一顺边溜，这是反对没有独立的联系。再如：若看左面，先从右面指去，若看下面，先从上面着眼；动而有静，乱而有定，这都是戏曲舞台上联系和独立的法则。
    三，省略和集中——中国画在布局上讲究疏密、聚散、详略繁简、浓淡虚实的法则，戏曲表演特别讲究这点。它不是繁琐地处处去要求合理，寻找生活的逻辑；而是让出路来腾出手来好解决重要的戏剧冲突。如“空城计”的三探，探报的时间观念，敌人进兵的具体情况，都不去详求，只说司马大兵离西城四十余里。一句话，而是把戏集中在表现孔明对敌情正确判断后，必须当机立断而又束手无策的激情之上。又如“群英会”的打盖，周瑜和孔明对座喝酒，这些地方力求省略，不求真实（戏曲舞台请客从来不吃菜的，只说一声酒宴摆下），而是把戏集中在周瑜对孔明怀着仇杀的心理但又只能克制的内心斗争。又如，十万人打仗，几个过场而已，只当作一种事件的交代；而高冲在阵地马失前蹄，扮演者却在舞台大做功夫，表现这位英雄如何在惊险中克服困难并奋勇追杀敌人的英雄气概。又如宋江寻书，当他找见了招文袋，搜寻不见，突将袋底翻转，两眼死死盯住，似乎要看到布缝里去，这种突出心理形象的艺术创作，比生活何止夸张十倍；可是舞台上写信或作文章，虽是洋洋千言，不到半分时间。对场子的结构也是如此，有些场子很大，但情节简单，表现人物的心理矛盾，渲染很浓；有些场子很小，但交代事件很多，只是轻描淡写，带过就算。
    四，实具和虚拟——虚拟动作，是戏曲表演的重要特点，它和舞台空间、时间的特殊处理不能分开，但是，虚拟不是无条件的，往往要一定的实具帮助表演。张飞跨下之骓可虚，而手中之枪不可虚；孙玉姣绣花时穿针引线可虚，而拾玉镯的玉镯不可虚；战场环境可虚，而两将交锋时你一刀我一枪不可虚；室内的门、窗和楼台阶梯可虚，而桌椅不可虚。也有很特殊的例子，看柳腔“玩会跳船”，一个书生逛累了，在路旁搬一块石头，这是用虚拟动作表演的；这还不算，他还撩起衣衫，翘起一腿坐在虚拟的石头之上打盹。这个动作很好看，虚拟的程度算是彻底的了，可是此生之足仍不能离开台面，可见绝对的虚拟是没有的。虚拟和实具的互相关系，不必机械去规定，要看具体的手法再研究。如果实具成为虚拟必要条件时就非用不可。木桨、马鞭等实具，离开人的表演没有什么意思，也不能真正代表什么；当它一结合表演，立刻就出现激流行舟、骏马奔腾的形势，实具和虚拟不是对立的。因此想到戏曲如何有机地用好布景，不是不能解决的问题。
    戏曲表演丰富多彩，这里只是在摸索一些基本规律，其实，这些规律不是戏曲艺术所独有，可是戏曲艺术对它表现得最突出。这些特殊规律，是中国人民传统的审美思想在舞台艺术上的概括的反映，创造这种精炼和谐的样式，是为了更集中地表现生活的斗争。
    三
    这里，应该特别谈谈戏曲表演上一个最重要的问题，即戏曲舞台的体验方法的问题，也是戏曲表演艺术现实主义和浪漫主义相结合的问题。
    音乐家、美术家、雕塑家，在体验生活后创作时，是用自己的特殊材料表现出来的，如音符、颜色、石膏等，惟有演员体验生活创作时，自己的身体就是材料，又是作品；它将创作者、材料、作品三者集合于一体。因此，在体验时心理和形体是一致的，一系列的心理感受过程和一系列的技巧体现过程也应是一致的；体验和表现就无法分开。中国戏曲的表现形式，是把中国人的生活方式，用传统的审美方法，通过舞台来表现的一种艺术形式。论体验，就有它自己的方法，这种体验方法是和前面所说的舞台规律相制约的。
    过去，戏曲演员对生活的观察和体验，范围极广，不限于人的言行活动。举凡妩媚潇洒的画中人物，刚健婀娜的雕刻塑像，以至鸢飞鱼跃、虎啸龙腾的姿态，都要观察，摹拟其形，摄取其神。把这种东西揉成一种特殊的技术，运用在自己的形体，这就是戏曲舞台“身段工架”的基础。老艺人盖叫天，甚至在袅袅香烟的盘旋中，去理解舞蹈动作的气势。这并不是脱离生活，而是留心观察各种现象，以丰富自己的形象构思。这一方面也可供我们参考。
    先把演员基本的身段工架训练好，甚至要把基本的表情形式和语言形式训练好，然后再深入角色的体验（在以前观察事物时也是有体验的，不一定是对具体角色的体验），再从角色的个性去融化这些东西，这是中国戏曲表演艺术特殊的体验方法。它是这样的：先接受前人从广泛生活体验中所形成的技术，到创作时，再从自己的具体的体验去消化它、批判它又丰富它。有些人有别的见解，认为只要有演员的热情，沉潜于角色之中，就能诞生出戏曲舞台的角色来，认为只要有了合乎生活逻辑的行动，就能有合乎戏曲舞台逻辑的行动。比较强调体验，而较少研究表现（话剧舞台艺术，有体验派和表现派的争论），这当然也是一种方法，不过我个人认为，戏曲舞台的情感，绝不等于生活的情感，它是生活情感经过彩色渲染、音乐弹奏过的东西，它是生活情感的诗化。一个戏曲演员，如果他的情感还没有转化成为一种技术时，那他一上台去，情感越是丰富，洋相就越要出足。试想，在戏曲舞台，正在锣鼓齐鸣，载歌载舞之际，其中忽有一个演员，因真实的体验生活，大泄其痛哭流涕的情感，那还不是大出洋相？这说明，戏曲舞台的情感，必须有精巧的设计，必须有表现的性质，只限于生活的体验的水平是不够的。但生活体验总是源泉，有再好的技术设计，如无深刻体验不过是傀儡式的灵巧而已。
    其实，任何剧种的舞台艺术，按其本性来说，所谓体验和表现，无法绝对分开。角色，必须靠演员的思想、情感，去分析它，体会它，所谓“设身处地将心比心”，这就不可能没有体验；演员，只是在假定的生活环境、虚构的事件中活动，所谓“假戏真做”，这就不可能没有表现。当然，把它当作一种科学的创作方法来研究，将两者予以区别，这是有意义的。那么，戏曲舞台的创作情况究竟是怎样的呢？我认为是这样：戏曲演员，应具有这样两种材料，一种是自己的情感，这是铸造角色的燃料；一种是基本的舞台技术（唱、做、念、打的基本功夫），这是铸造角色的钢材；演员，在规定情境的洪炉中，燃烧自己的热情，将这些钢材熔解在角色之中。这就是戏曲表演艺术特殊的体验方法和性质。戏曲演员不掌握技术，单靠生活激情的奔放那是不行的。应当经常训练自己的感觉器官，训练成乐器那样，然后始能利用自己的激情，奏出角色的心曲。运用戏曲技术和深入生活体验，其中是有矛盾的，矛盾表现在：体验要靠技术给以形式但又要突破这种形式，技术要靠体验给以内容但又要约束这种内容。这种矛盾运动，就使戏曲艺术强烈的表现和深刻的体验达到统一，鲜明的形式感和真实感达到统一。戏曲体验的特殊方法还在于动作的贯串线这一理解上。比如话剧，只要它允许上台的东西（指道具、布景等等，自然包括动作）都要求合理；这种合理，必须是合乎现实生活形式的生活逻辑的，虽然是经过舞台处理的。戏曲的体验则有区别，它是按照自己的特殊规律去合理的，一个圆场数十里，八个龙套十万兵，就不可能按照现实生活的贯串动作去合理。
    我们研究戏曲艺术的特殊规律和它的体验方法，目的是为了在新的条件下发展它使能更好地反映历史的生活现实和今天的生活现实，而不是墨守成规，故步自封。既是民族形式，如果只善于反映历史生活（还仅仅是封建社会的）不善于反映今天的生活，这是不合逻辑的。可是，我们要学习戏曲艺术的特点，偏偏这种特点和表现今天的生活又是有矛盾的。在戏曲表演艺术上越是有丰富宝藏的大剧种和今天的生活越是有距离，如何取其精华弃其糟粕使能为反映社会主义的生活起积极作用，这个任务一定要很好完成它。马克思主义的美学原则不是离开生活去审美的。因此，在戏曲表现当前生活时，传统形式的特点也必然有改变，任何艺术形式的特殊性，它是既决定于特殊的艺术手段更决定于生活的。这样说并不等于对承继传统允许有任何轻视的态度，我们的看法，从来认为旧形式和新内容有制约关系的。接受传统形式，首先是从具体生活出发，是生活的特点决定艺术的特点，同时也必须承认每种艺术形式又总是限制在自己的特殊手段去反映生活的。不理解这个关系，也就不能正确地去理解承继传统、发展传统的关系。发展戏曲形式应该向话剧和其它兄弟艺术好好学习，它当然要变，要革新，一味保守是错误的，但又总是要区别于其它舞台艺术而独特地存在着。
    在党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针指导下，中国戏曲事业的发展，处于历史最繁荣的时代，特别是新生力量，前途无量。苗头已经露出来了，我们的百花园中，正开放出奇异的、为任何历史时代所不能媲美的绚烂夺目的鲜花。1959年12月3日夜于中国京剧院
