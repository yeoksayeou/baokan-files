    Unprecedented Bumper Autumn Rice Harvest in Northern Vietnam
    American-Ngo Clique's Brutal Tyranny Leads to Disastrous Results
    South Vietnam Experiences Consecutive Years of Poor Harvests and Widespread Famine

    In stark contrast to the unprecedented bumper autumn rice harvest in Northern Vietnam this year, South Vietnam presents a scene of poor harvests and famine.

    According to preliminary estimates by the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, this year's average yield of autumn rice in North Vietnam will reach 2,500 kilograms per hectare, with some agricultural production cooperatives achieving an average yield of 4,000 to 6,500 kilograms per hectare.

    However, in South Vietnam, since the restoration of peace five years ago, the total rice output has consistently failed to reach pre-war levels, resulting in annual famines. A recent letter from South Vietnam to North Vietnam, as published in newspapers, stated: "Here, people worry every day, living hand to mouth, with one meal not covering the next. In the past, famine occurred during the lean months, but this year famine appeared as early as May and June. Now the harvest is in, but the famine problem remains unresolved." An article in Saigon's "Freedom News" on July 31 and August 1 this year stated that in a certain village in Tam Binh district, Vinh Long province, crop failures reached 60%, with many farmers unable to pay rent and taxes, leading to arrests or forced escapes.

    The American-Ngo clique's series of reactionary policies, including various taxes, rents, conscription, "land reclamation zones," and "anti-communism," have severely damaged agricultural production in South Vietnam. Under these circumstances, the area of wasteland is increasing, yields are decreasing, and famine is becoming increasingly serious. According to Saigon's "Vietnam Times," South Vietnam's total rice production last year was only 2.94 million tons, a decrease of nearly one million tons compared to the pre-war total rice production of South Vietnam in 1939. South Vietnam's autumn rice harvest has not yet been completed this year, but judging from the serious disasters that have already occurred, the crop failure is severe. Two months ago, when the rice was still heading, 10,000 mu of farmland in just five provinces in the eastern part of South Vietnam were affected by pests. According to news from South Vietnam, in the vast plains of eastern South Vietnam, such as Xin Ding, Pingcheng, Jia Ping, Anhe, and Longcheng, it is estimated that crop failures due to pests and floods will reach 50%. The fields in the Bihe area have long been burned by Ngo Dinh Diem's troops. Due to drought and the continuous "sweeps" by the American-Ngo clique, the area of wasteland in the western part of South Vietnam this year has reached 40% to 50%.

    Saigon's "Commercial Weekly" reported on July 31 this year that the mid-season rice in Binh Dinh and Quang Ngai provinces in central South Vietnam had also suffered severe crop failures due to floods and unstable rural conditions.

### 越南北方秋稻空前丰收  美吴集团横施暴政造成恶果  南越年年歉收一片饥荒

    两种制度两般景况　鱼米之乡一丰一歉
    越南北方秋稻空前丰收
    美吴集团横施暴政造成恶果
    南越年年歉收一片饥荒
    同越南北方今年秋稻获得空前丰收正相反，南越是一片歉收、饥荒景象。
    据越南民主共和国部长会议初步估计，今年北越秋稻每公顷平均产量将达到二千五百公斤，有一些农业生产合作社平均每公顷产量还可达到四千至六千五百公斤。
    但是在南越，自从和平恢复五年来，稻谷总产量一直达不到战前水平，年年发生饥荒。据报纸刊载的最近从南越寄到北越来的一封信写道：“在这里，人民天天忧虑，朝不保夕，上顿不接下顿。往年饥荒发生在青黄不接的几个月期间，但今年5、6月就出现饥荒现象了。现在收割了，但饥荒问题还不能解决”。西贡“自由报”在今年7月31日和8月1日的一篇通讯里说，在永隆省三平县某乡，庄稼歉收达到60％，许多农民交不了租和税，被南越当局抓去或被迫逃亡。
    美吴集团的各种赋税、租息、兵役、“垦荒区”、“控共”等一系列的反动政策，使南越农业生产遭到严重的破坏。在这种情况下，荒地面积日益增多，产量日益下降，因而饥荒现象也日益严重。据西贡“越南时报”报道，南越去年的稻子总产量只有二百九十四万吨，比战前1939年南越稻子总产量下降了将近一百万吨。南越今年秋稻还没有收割完毕，但是根据早先出现的严重灾情来看，歉收是严重的。两个月以前，当稻子正在抽穗的时候，仅在南越南部东面地区五个省，就有一万亩田地遭受虫害。据来自南越的消息说，在南越东面地区的大平原，如心定、平城、加平、安和、隆成等地，估计因受到虫害和水灾将歉收50％。比河地区的田地早被吴庭艳军队烧光。南越南部西面地区由于旱灾和美吴集团的连续“扫荡”，今年荒地面积达到40％到50％。
    西贡“商业周刊”今年7月31日报道，今年南越中部的平定、广义等省的中稻因受到水灾和农村情况不安定也遭到严重歉收。
