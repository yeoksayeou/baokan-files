Ah, comrade, if you take a trip to Anshan, you will immediately find yourself immersed in a wave of joy and high spirits as soon as you get off the train! The entire city's working people are involved in the joint technical performance competition movement. The vehicle you're riding might be a "performance vehicle," with the driver and conductor providing meticulous service. When you enter a restaurant, the dishes you eat might be prepared by a participating master chef. Otherwise, why would they be so delicious? If you visit a factory, you will surely be stunned by the overproduction figures, surrounded by numerous winning red flags and production pacesetters and red flag bearers wearing red flowers on their chests, making you feel that you are indeed living in a world of heroes. So, please take a close look at them. Apart from a bit of oil and iron filings, their faces and hands are no different from ordinary people, are they? However, it is they, these tens of thousands of steel warriors, who in ten years have done things that made 600 million people happy and frightened the imperialists. They, with their own hands, transformed the Kuomintang's enterprise, which originally produced over 9,000 tons of steel ingots annually (the highest annual output during the puppet Manchukuo regime was 840,000 tons), into a large-scale iron and steel complex with an annual output of 5.5 million tons, one of the largest in the world. Guess how many workers and cadres have been transferred from here to other places in the past ten years? A total of over 120,000 management cadres, technical cadres, and workers have been transferred to support various provinces, and over 14 million tons of steel have been supplied. However, the eyes of the working class are always looking forward. Even this little bit is still far from building a prosperous and strong socialist industrial country. From the eager eyes of our farmer brothers, steelworkers know they need tractors and new farm implements, and communes need to run their own factories. The brothers of ethnic minorities in the Southwest and Northwest need to build railways and develop underground resources. What is most unforgettable for the steelworkers is a small investment of 38.5 yuan sent to them by a group of elementary school students from the Li ethnic group, earned from picking manure through work-study programs, to develop the country's steel industry. It is truly a trivial gift with profound significance, representing the aspirations of so many ethnic minority brothers! The resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC are closely tied to their hearts. The joint technical performance competition emerged amidst a massive mass movement.

Speaking of technical performance, we must first talk about Feng Zhitai, who fired the first shot at Ansteel's Third Steelmaking Plant. Feng Zhitai was an inconspicuous young man in the open-hearth furnace section of the Third Steelmaking Plant. He had only been in the factory for three years and his technical skills were very ordinary. This 21-year-old young man was always energetic and cheerful. When the Party committee mobilized the workers to perform technical demonstrations, he was truly fearless as a newborn calf. As long as it could increase production, he was willing to go through fire and water. But after saying the words, he started to struggle ideologically. "Didn't the old workers say that performing requires a complete set of mature experiences? What can my skills amount to? I don't even have two skills, how can I compete with others?" He discussed his concerns with his good friend Jiang Guozhong for half the night, but still couldn't make up his mind. Later, he talked to the Youth League secretary, which finally strengthened his resolve. Indeed, the key problem in the Third Steelmaking Plant was the slow tapping of the steel, which took three hours in the worst cases and at least 45 minutes in the best. And time waits for no one; only people can walk ahead of time. Feng Zhitai set himself a challenging goal: to open the tapping hole in 30 minutes and strive to complete it in 20 minutes. The next day, he arrived an hour early for work. As soon as he arrived, he inspected the front and back of the furnace, the top of the furnace, and the inside of the furnace, and prepared all the tools for tapping the steel early. Don't be fooled by his usual smile and boisterousness, and his somewhat impulsive way of speaking; when he got to work, he was bold and careful. Sure enough, when he challenged in front of the loudspeakers, many people came to watch his performance, including veteran workers, foremen, and furnace chiefs. As for him, he was as calm and composed as an old maid in the bridal chamber. No matter how many eyes were watching him, he only stared intently at the tapping hole, calmly and skillfully striking. At this time, he remembered many stories of battles. In order to win the war, hadn't many brave soldiers captured a pillbox in a few minutes? Now, in order to defend the general line, he must open the tapping hole in 20 minutes. He felt that his shoulders were carrying a difficult and glorious task. At this moment, 30 minutes was a serious test for him, seeming longer than the 21 years he had already lived. As a result, the tapping hole was opened in 20 minutes. When the news of the victory was broadcast, the molten steel was already rushing along the tapping channel. The successful performance of this assistant, who had only been in the factory for three years, dispelled the concerns of many people. Afterwards, more and more people responded to Feng Zhitai's challenge, and some even opened the tapping hole in 16 minutes.

The First Steelmaking Plant, being an old factory, took the lead again in output after learning from the Third Steelmaking Plant's performance competition. The performance of the No. 6 open-hearth furnace here was even more outstanding, immediately becoming the target of the brotherly open-hearth furnaces in the three steelmaking plants. Everyone sent people to learn from them and asked them to send people to perform. Luo Yuandi, the chief furnace operator of the No. 6 open-hearth furnace, had just been selected as a representative of advanced units to attend the "Heroes' Congress." He had a lot of things waiting for him, such as preparing to report achievements to the Party Central Committee, sending greetings to Chairman Mao, and learning from advanced open-hearth furnaces across the country, which were enough to keep him busy. But after thinking about it, he still felt that helping others was more important. If all the open-hearth furnaces in Anshan could maintain their furnaces well, they could produce more and offer it as a gift to the "Heroes' Congress." So he resolutely went to help others. In the deep autumn weather, this honest steelworker wiped sweat in front of this furnace for a while and performed charging in front of that furnace for a while. He was so busy and happy. At this time, the Second Steelmaking Plant was anxious because its output had not yet jumped up, so it hurriedly sought advice from the Third Steelmaking Plant. Zeng Yangqing, the director of the First Steelmaking Plant, specially went to the Second Steelmaking Plant to present treasures, demonstrating to the workers there the experiences he had gained since the Great Leap Forward in pouring molten iron and solving the problem of cold material floating. As a result, the output of the Second Steelmaking Plant increased sharply and once again took the lead. The three steelmaking plants ran in a line, chasing each other, which was so lively!

The Southern Machinery Repair Factory saw the emergence of Song Keyou, a milling worker who had won every battle. People called him "General Ever-Victorious." Those with good skills couldn't beat him, and those with poor skills were even more incomparable. One day, a forty-year-old opponent with a scruffy beard came to him to compete. He took a look and realized it was the Party committee secretary! He knew that Secretary Li came from a working-class background but had been away from the milling machine for more than ten years. He thought, "I am sure to win against him, but I can't just aim for speed and cause a safety accident for the secretary." At the beginning of the competition, he deliberately slowed down his pace, but in less than half an hour, his apprentice quietly ran over and told him that Secretary Li had already left him behind by five or six! Upon hearing this, he felt relieved and gradually used his own skills. Two hours later, "General Ever-Victorious," driving at full speed, had only won against Secretary Li by a dozen. Secretary Li came over to pour tea for "General Ever-Victorious" and personally pinned the big red flower on his chest. The young apprentices were envious and boldly participated in the performance competition. Soon, their skills also improved. There were even apprentices who surpassed their masters.

Despite the right-wing opportunists cursing the mass movement, the mass movement blossomed and bore fruit in the advancement of production. The broad masses of workers in Anshan are constantly using their own experience and talents to enrich the joint technical performance competition movement.

If you walk into the Rolling Mill, you will be attracted by the dozens of feet long red steel plate that rushes out of the continuous rolling mill like a golden dragon. It not only provides us with boiler plates and steel plates for cars and trains, but it may also evoke your distant fantasies: if people could ride on such a gleaming golden dragon, then 600 million people would leap forward and, in the near future, leave the imperialists behind. Just as you are admiring this magnificent scene, you will find the words "Equipment Hospital" written on the whitewashed wall, and you will see the names of the院长, 大夫, and the patient's medical records. "How can there be a hospital in the workshop?" Uh, please don't worry, this is just another form of performance competition. It turns out that the workers in the equipment section want to take the initiative to compete to repair the equipment in various sections, so they specially opened this "hospital." Since the launch of the competition, the lubrication team alone has repaired more than 1,200 oil leaks in two days, saving the country about 300 kilograms of lubricating oil every day. Now, when machines are sick, there is no need to ask "doctors" to come, but the "doctors" come to them themselves. Minor illnesses are treated by the maintenance workers, and serious illnesses are "consulted," and many living "Hua Tuos" come uninvited. Since the establishment of this "Equipment Hospital," the difficult and complex faults of the machines in this rolling mill have been almost completely eliminated.

If you go to the Northern Machinery Repair Factory again, you will see a lively "market," among which there is a couple dressed as farmers, the man wearing a straw hat and carrying a satchel, and the woman wearing a headscarf and floral clothes, dancing a Yangko dance to "go to market." You should be surprised again, how can there be a "market" in the factory? It turns out that the workers want to contribute their advanced experiences, so that these scattered and fragmented experiences can be summarized, improved, and sorted out to become complete and comprehensive experiences. This kind of "market" shows that the experiences created by the masses are summarized by the masses themselves, so that the performance competition movement can be consolidated and further improved. The man in this "market" couple is the leader of the tide mold team, and the woman is a core worker. The couple studied several sets of advanced experiences such as "small round mud molds" overnight and came specially to dedicate them to everyone, and wanted to bring some advanced experiences back from the "market" to form a complete set.

The lively competition in the workshops made the employees of the affiliated departments of various factories and mines envious. A girl watching bicycles couldn't help but sigh, "Alas, I can only blame the leaders for assigning me to do this unpromising job. If I worked in the workshop, I would have to show off a few skills." But sighing is no longer the nature of the young people of this era. The girl circled around the dense layers of bicycles, patting this seat for a while and looking at the sky after the rain for a while. After thinking for a long time, she suddenly jumped up with joy and shouted to herself, "I've got it!" She quickly found gauze, picked out the dirtiest bicycle, cleaned it, and polished several bicycles in half a day. After work, a young man came out to find his bicycle, but couldn't find it after searching for a long time. The girl pointed to a sparkling bicycle and asked, "Is it this one?" The young man shook his head and said, "The license plate is correct, but my bicycle was originally so dirty that it was unrecognizable. I've been so busy these days..." The young man became more and more embarrassed. The girl quickly explained, "I cleaned it for you." The young man was both moved and happy, and was stunned and didn't know what to say. The girl helped him push the bicycle and said, "Go home and eat quickly." She smiled and also posted a big-character poster for herself: "Bicycle cleaning performance: You produce more, I will clean your bicycles more..."

The old man watching the tools also refused to fall behind. He repaired the worn-out work shoes used by the workers and repaired the flashlights used by the whole factory in half a month, saving the country a large sum of money. After he finished these things, he thought happily in his heart, "The older we get, the more interesting our lives become! It's the Great Leap Forward!"

As for doctors and nurses personally going to the workshops to see patients and deliver medicines, and staff members delivering water to the construction sites and workshops, and master chefs delivering fragrant meals to the front lines, construction sites, and pit mouths, there are even more. Comrade, you must be concerned about the few backward workers in the workshop, right? After the Great Leap Forward last year, there were already very few of them, and now, they are even harder to find. I will give you a few examples and you will understand. There used to be a "Slip-Edge Mr.," who always sat on the side and dozed off whenever there was a meeting. If you asked him for his opinion, he would suddenly raise his head and answer, "No, I have no opinion." When it came to work, he would always slip to the side and do the easy jobs. But after the great performance, this "Slip-Edge Mr." also changed. He now walks ahead of things and speaks actively at meetings. So the workers made up a jingle for him, called "Slip-Edge Mr. doesn't slip the edge anymore," which he likes to hear himself. There was also an old worker who had a bad temper and liked to get angry. He would slack off himself and not want others to criticize him. The workers gave him the elegant nickname "God of Fire." Recently, I heard that this "God of Fire" has changed in the performance competition. He is now active in work and even asks people to give him opinions at meetings. A good writer gave him a big-character poster with the title "God of Fire Transforms into the Earth God!"

    心儿笑  焰儿高  红旗飘
    草明
    啊，同志，你要是到鞍山走一趟，一下车便会立刻生活在欢欣昂扬的气浪里。——这儿整个城市的劳动人们都卷进了联合技术表演竞赛运动里了。你坐的车子可能是部表演车，司机和售票员招呼的无微不至，进了饭馆，你吃的菜说不定就是参加表演的大师傅亲手做的，不然为什么炒的这么香？要是你进厂参观，你准会被超产的数字惊的目定口呆，在你周围的是如此众多的优胜红旗和胸前挂了红花的生产标兵和红旗手；使你感到自己确实生活在英雄的世界里。那么，请你仔细瞧瞧他们吧。他们的脸和手除了沾了些机油和铁屑之外，和平常人没有两样是不是？然而，就是他们，就是这十几万的钢铁战士在十年之内干了使六亿人民高兴、叫帝国主义颤惊的事。——他们用自己的双手，把国民党原是年产九千多吨钢锭（伪满时最高那年年产八十四万吨）的企业变成年产五百五十万吨的、世界有数的大型钢铁联合企业。你猜猜，十年来，这儿已为国家输出过多少工人和干部？一共输出了十二万多的管理干部、技术干部和工人；支援各省的钢材共达一千四百多万吨。可是工人阶级的眼睛永远是朝前看的，仅这么一点点，距离建设一个富强的社会主义工业国还远得很哩。从农民弟兄的殷切的眼光里，钢铁工人知道他们需要拖拉机和新式农具，公社需要办自己的工厂。西南、西北的少数民族的兄弟们需要修筑铁路和开发地下富源。最最使钢铁工人难忘的，是黎族的一群小学生给他们汇去的一笔由勤工俭学中拣粪得来的、要发展祖国钢铁工业的三十八元五角的小小的投资，真是千里鹅毛、意义重大，这代表了多少少数民族弟兄的愿望啊！八中全会的决议紧扣着他们的心弦。联合技术表演竞赛便在大搞群众运动中产生了。
    提到技术表演，不能不先讲讲鞍钢第三炼钢厂打响头一炮的冯志太。冯志太在三炼钢平炉工段里是个不显眼的小伙子。进厂只有三年，技术也很一般。这个二十一岁的小伙子，成天活蹦乱跳，乐的合不拢嘴。那天党委动员工人们作技术表演时，他真是初生之犊不怕虎，只要能增产，就是赴汤蹈火也情愿。但是话说出嘴以后，思想就斗争开了。“刚才老工人不是说吗，人家表演要有成套的成熟经验，我这两下顶个啥？我连两下也没有，还和人竞赛呢！”他把自己的心事和好朋友蒋国忠商量了半宿，还没拿个准。后来去找团支书谈了谈，才算坚定下来。可不是，三炼钢的关键问题就是打出钢口太慢，慢的三个小时，快的最少也要四十五分钟。而时间是不等人的，只有人走在时间前面。冯志太就给自己定下了挑战的指标：要三十分钟打开出钢口，争取二十分钟完成。第二天，他提前一个多钟点上班，一上班就炉前、炉后、炉顶、炉内都检查个遍，早早把打出钢口的家什准备停当。别看他平常爱笑能闹，讲话还有点冲，干起活来倒是胆大心细。果然，他在广播器前一挑战，来看他表演的人就不少，有老工人，有工长、炉长。他呢，像老闺女拜堂，心安胆定，不管你多少眼睛瞅着他，他却只瞪大两眼狠狠盯出钢口，沉着地、巧妙地打。这时他想起了许多战斗的故事，为了战争的胜利，不是曾经有过许多英勇的战士在几分钟之内拿下一座碉堡吗？现在，他为了保卫总路线，他必须要在二十分钟内打开出钢口。他觉得自己的双肩担起了又艰巨又光荣的任务。在这时刻里，三十分钟对他来说是个严肃的考验，仿佛比他已生活过的二十一年还长似的。结果，二十分钟便打开了出钢口。当广播器传出胜利的消息时，钢水已沿着出钢槽哗哗地奔腾出来了。这个入厂才三年的助手表演成功，给许多人打破了顾虑。以后和冯志太应战的人多了起来，有的人十六分钟就打开出钢口了。
    一炼钢到底是个老厂，学习了三炼钢的表演竞赛后，产量便又领了先。这儿的红旗炉六号平炉的成绩更突出，一下子便成为三个炼钢厂的兄弟平炉的目标，大家都派人来学习和要求他们派人去表演。六号平炉总炉长罗远弟那几天正是被选为先进单位的代表，要出席“群英会”。准备向党中央汇报成绩、给毛主席捎好，向全国先进平炉学习等一大堆事情等着他做，够他忙的啦，他把身子劈开两半也不够用呀。但是他一寻思，还是帮助别人要紧，要是鞍钢所有的平炉都维护好了炉体，便可以多生产，向“群英会”献礼。他便毅然去帮助别人。在深秋的天气里，这个敦厚的炼钢工人，一时在这个炉子前边擦汗，一时又在那个炉前表演装料。把他忙的乐呵呵的。这时节，急煞了二炼钢厂，因为它的产量还没有跃上去，便急忙向三炼钢取经。一炼钢厂长曾扬清特地上二炼钢献宝，把自己大跃进以来研究所得的兑铁水、解决冷料上浮等经验对那儿的职工表演一番。这样，二炼钢产量猛增，又一马当先了。三个炼钢厂一条线儿赛跑，你追我赶，好不热闹！
    南部机修厂出现了一个百战百胜的铣工宋克有。人家叫他“常胜将军”，技术好的，赛不过他，技术差的，更是比不过他。有一天，他面前走过来一个胡子拉撒的四十来岁的对手，要和他竞赛。他一瞅，可不是党委书记吗？他知道李书记是工人出身，但是撂下铣床已十几年啦。他想，“赢他是有把握的，可是，我不能只图快，让书记出安全事故。”竞赛一开始，他有意放慢了手脚，但是不到半小时，徒弟悄悄跑来告诉他，李书记已把他拉下五六个啦！他一听，放了心，就逐渐使出自己的本事来。两小时后，“常胜将军”开了快车才不过赢了李书记十来个呢。李书记过来给“常胜将军”倒茶，亲自把大红花给他戴在胸前。小徒工们看的眼热了，也大胆地参加了表演竞赛，不久，技术也提高了。还有徒弟胜过师傅的呢。
    尽管右倾机会主义者诅咒大搞群众运动，但是群众运动却在生产前进中开花结果，鞍钢的广大工人不断用自己的经验和才能，来丰富联合技术表演竞赛运动。
    要是你走到轧板厂，一条金龙似地从连轧机飞奔出来的几十丈长的红色的钢板吸引着你。它不仅给我们制造锅炉板和汽车、火车用的钢板，也许它会引起你遥远的幻想：如果人们能乘坐在这样一条金光闪耀的火龙上面，那么，六亿人民将会飞跃前进，而在不远的将来，把帝国主义抛在后头。正当你欣赏这壮丽的景色时，你会发现粉墙上写着“设备医院”四个大字，并从那上头看到了院长、大夫的名字和患者的病志。“车间何来医院？”呃，请不要着急，这只不过是表演竞赛的另一种形式。原来设备工段的工人要主动地争先检修各工段的设备，特意开了这所“医院”。开展竞赛以来，光是滑润小组用了两天工夫，就修好漏油处达一千二百余处。每天为国家节约三百来公斤润滑油。现在机器有病不用去请“医生”，而是“医生”自己找上门来。轻病，检修工人就给治了，重病就“会诊”，许多活“华陀”便不召自来。自从有了这所“设备医院”，这个轧板厂的机器的疑难故障几乎一扫而光。
    你再到北部机修厂看一看，那里“集市”热火朝天，其中有一对农民打扮的夫妇，男的戴了草帽，背了挂包，女的包了头帕，穿了花衣裳，扭着秧歌来“赶集”。你又该奇怪了吧，工厂怎会“赶集”？原来工人们要把自己创造的先进经验献出来，使这些分散的零碎的经验经过归纳、提高和整理，成为整套的完整的经验。这种“赶集”就表明了群众创造的经验由群众自己来总结，使表演竞赛运动得到巩固和进一步提高。这对“赶集”的夫妻男的是潮模组的组长，女的是芯子工人，小两口连夜研究了几套“小圆型泥模”等先进经验，特意来献给大伙。并想从“集市”带些先进经验回去好配套。
    车间里的热火朝天的竞赛，使各厂矿的附属部门的职工瞅的眼热。一个看自行车的姑娘不免自嗟自叹：“唉，怪只怪领导上分配我做这个没出息的工作，要是我在车间干活，也得露它两手。”可是嗟叹已不是这个时代的青年人的本色了。姑娘绕着密密层层的自行车直转圈，一下拍拍这个车座，一下望望雨后放晴的天空。想了半天，忽然欢喜的跳起来，自己叫道，“有啦！”她连忙找来纱布，挑自行车中最脏的推出来，擦干净，半天工夫就擦亮了好几部车子。下班了，有个小伙子出来找车，找了半天没找着。姑娘指给他一部亮晶晶车子问道：“是不是这部？”小伙摇摇头说“车牌对呀，只是我的车子原来脏的不像样，这几天忙的呀——”，小伙越说越不好意思了。姑娘连忙解释说：“我代你擦干净啦。”小伙子又是感动又是喜，竟楞住不知说什么。姑娘帮他推着车子说：“快回家吃饭吧。”她一乐，也给自己贴了一张大字报：“擦车表演：你们多生产，我给你们多擦车……”
    看工具的老头儿，也不甘拉后，在半个月之内把工友们用的破大头鞋修好了，把全厂用的手电筒修好了，为国家节约了一大笔钱。他做完了这些事，心里乐呵呵地想：“我们老人越活越有意思，大跃进嘛！”
    至于大夫、护士亲自上车间看病送药，职员到工地车间送水，大师傅把喷香的饭菜送到现场、工地和坑口的就更多了。同志，你一定会关心车间里的少数落后工友吧？经过去年大跃进，本来已经少的多，现在，更不好找了。我讲几个例子你就会明白。过去有位“溜边先生”，凡是开会他就坐在一边打盹，你要是问他有什么意见，他冷丁抬起头，准会答道：“没有，我没意见。”要是干活，他准会溜在一边，捡轻松的活做。但是经过大表演，这位“溜边先生”也改变了，有事也走在头里，开会也积极发言。所以工友们给他编了首顺口溜，叫做“溜边先生不溜边”，他自个听着还乐哩。又有一位老工人体性不好，爱发火，自己偷了懒还不愿人家批评。工友们送他个雅号叫做“火神爷”。最近我一打听，这位“火神爷”在表演竞赛中转变啦，干活也积极，开会时还叫人家对他提意见。有个好提笔的人给他送了张大字报，题目叫：“火神爷变土地老！”
