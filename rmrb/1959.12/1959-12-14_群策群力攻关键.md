The Daye Steel Plant adopted the method of "encircling key points," rapidly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and launching a vigorous new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution. In more than three months, they solved more than twenty major key problems and implemented more than one hundred and forty technical revolution measures. Everyone was full of energy, everyone was in a good mood, production increased month by month, and all indicators made comprehensive leaps forward.

Carrying out a mass movement of "encircling key points" is a good way to deeply mobilize the masses to carry out technical revolutions on the industrial front. Since 1958, a significant new feature of China's industrial front has been the large-scale mass movement. The once deserted situation of industry being run only by experts and a few people has been transformed into a vigorous great leap forward. This is a great victory for the Party's mass line on the industrial front. With the development of the situation and the deepening of the movement, the leadership is required to guide the masses more deeply and meticulously to solve the most important key problems. The great significance of the "key point attack movement" lies in its ability to guide the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses to solve major problems. Under the unified leadership of the Party, mobilize the broad masses, identify the main contradictions, and have the Party committee determine the tasks, principles, methods, and some basic principles for tackling key problems, and determine clear goals. In this way, the mass movement and the Party's leadership are correctly combined, and the mass "key point attack movement" can develop healthily.

In the technical revolution, there is also a struggle between two lines. One line is that a few technicians do it themselves, or at most, they generally solicit the opinions of the workers, but the main thing is still the activities of a few people. This is a road of less, slower, worse, and more expensive. In this way, the technical revolution will inevitably be deserted, and a real technical revolution cannot be carried out, with very little effect. The other path is to extensively and deeply mobilize the broad masses, believe in the strength and wisdom of the masses, and turn the technical revolution into a real mass movement, which will inevitably be more, faster, better, and more economical. What is the "key point" in the "key point attack movement"? This "key point" is actually some of the weak links in production. Taking the key problems in the weak links as major "key points" to encircle and attack points out the direction for the technical revolution and opens up a path. The primary rolling mill of the rolling steel mill of Daye Steel Plant is equipped with the world's latest automated technology, and the people who use these machines are farmers who have never seen a machine and workers who have never seen this new type of equipment. According to the general situation, it will take at least two years to learn how to use this machine and bring production up to the design level. Under this situation, many people doubted whether technical revolution could be carried out. Some people said: "It would be good enough to learn how to use it within two years, why bother with technical revolution." Before the "key point attack movement" was launched, some people had proposed certain innovation measures, but unfortunately the goals were not concentrated, the direction was not clear, and the technical revolution movement could not be carried out. Since the "key point attack movement" began, thirty-nine major key problems have been solved in just over two months, and 524 major measures have been implemented. Those who just put down their hoes and those who had never seen such modern machines not only learned to master the most modern rolling mills, enabling the machine to reach its designed production level, but also greatly exceeded the design level. If it were not for the mass technical revolution, how could this miracle have been imagined?

Vigorously launching mass movements, extensively carrying out technical innovations, and promoting the continuous leap forward of production and construction are major tasks on the industrial front. The "key point attack movement" of the Daye Steel Plant provides the leading departments of industrial and mining enterprises in various places with a new method for deeply carrying out mass movements: pooling efforts to tackle key problems. This method is worth popularizing.

    群策群力攻关键
    大冶钢厂采用围攻关键的方法，把广大职工群众的积极性迅速调动起来，掀起了蓬蓬勃勃的技术革新和技术革命的新高潮。三个多月的时间内，解决二十多个重大关键问题，实现了一百四十多项技术革命措施。人人干劲冲天，个个心情舒畅，生产月月上升，各项指标全面跃进。
    开展群众性的围攻关键运动，是工业战线上深入发动群众大搞技术革命的一种好形式。从1958年以来，我国工业战线上一个新的重大特点是大搞群众运动。把工业战线上只是专家办工业和少数人办工业的冷冷清清的局面，一变而为轰轰烈烈的大跃进局面。这是党的群众路线在工业战线上的巨大胜利。随着形势的发展和运动的深入，要求领导工作更加深入和细致地引导群众去解决最主要的关键问题。“攻关运动”的重大意义在于它能把广大群众的革命热情引导去解决主要问题。在党的统一领导下，发动广大群众，摸清主要矛盾，由党委确定攻关的任务、方针、方法和一些基本原则，确定明确的奋斗目标，大家围绕一定的目标进行工作。这样，群众运动和党的领导就正确地结合起来，群众性的攻关运动就能健康地发展。
    在技术革命中，也存在着两条路线的斗争。一条路线是少数技术人员自己干或至多不过是一般地征求一下工人的意见，主要的仍是少数人的活动。这是一条少慢差费的道路。这样，必然把技术革命搞得冷冷清清，真正的技术革命开展不起来，收效很小；另一条道路就是广泛深入地发动广大群众，相信群众的力量和智慧，把技术革命变成真正的群众运动，这样就必然多快好省。攻关运动的“关”是什么呢？这个“关”，实际上就是生产中的一些薄弱环节。把薄弱环节中的关键问题作为重大的“关”来围攻，这就给技术革命指出了方向，开辟了道路。大冶钢厂轧钢部的初轧机是采用世界最新的自动化的技术装备起来的，而使用这些机器的人，则是没有见过机器的农民和没有见过这种新式设备的工人。按照一般情况，要学会使用这种机器并使生产达到设计水平，最少也要两年时间。在这种情况下，能不能搞技术革命，很多人是怀疑的，有人就这样说：“能在两年内学会使用也不错了，还搞什么技术革命”。在开展攻关运动前，也曾有人提出过某些革新措施，无奈目标不集中，方向不明确，技术革命运动开展不起来。自从攻关运动以来，仅仅两个多月的时间内，已解决的重大关键就有三十九个，已实现的主要措施达五百二十四条。那些刚放下锄头的人和没有见过这样现代化机器的人，不仅学会了掌握最现代化的轧钢机，使机器生产达到了设计水平，而且大大超过了设计水平。如果不是开展群众性的技术革命，这个奇迹怎么可能想像呢？
    大搞群众运动，广泛开展技术革新，推动生产建设不断跃进，这是工业战线上的重大任务。大冶钢厂的攻关运动给各地工矿企业领导部门深入开展群众运动提供了一个新的方法：群策群力，围攻关键。这一方法值得推广。
