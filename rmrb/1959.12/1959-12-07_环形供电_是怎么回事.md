    What is "Ring Power Supply"?
    "Ring power supply" means connecting the power supply lines in a ring shape to supply power. In the past, the workshops inside factories were not connected to each other in terms of electrical circuits. After the ring power supply is implemented, the workshops are connected to each other, and the substations are connected to each other. When a fault occurs in one line or a substation fails, power can still be supplied by other lines or substations, which is safer and more reliable.

    “环形供电”是怎么回事
    “环形供电”就是将供电线路接成环形来供电。过去工厂内部各车间之间在电路上是互相不联系的，环形供电后，各车间之间互相连通，各变电所之间互相连通；当一条线路发生故障或一个变电所出故障时，仍可由其他线路或变电所供电，这样就更加安全可靠。
