Cotton High Yields Spread in All Directions
    A Batch of Counties and Cities Report Good News of Over 100 Jin Per Mu of Ginned Cotton
    Achieving the Highest Target Stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program Eight Years Ahead of Schedule
　　Xinjiang
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi Electric Dispatch: In Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the average per mu yield of cotton in Turpan, Shanshan, and Makit counties has broken through the 100 jin ginned cotton mark. Among them, Turpan County's 77,800 mu of cotton fields averaged 130 jin of ginned cotton per mu, Shanshan County's 63,000 mu of cotton fields averaged 129.94 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and Makit County's more than 67,000 mu of cotton fields averaged 135 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    The bumper harvest of cotton in Turpan, Shanshan, Makit, and other three counties is the result of fully utilizing the superiority of the people's communes and overcoming various disasters. This year, Turpan County's cotton suffered from the threat of drought; Makit County's cotton suffered from frost damage when it grew three or four leaves; at the same time, all three counties experienced major insect pests such as red spiders and cutworms. However, thanks to the leadership of the local Party organizations, the farmers of all ethnic groups in the three counties established cotton professional teams and professional groups, fought disasters to protect seedlings, strengthened field management, and continuously fought against natural disasters, thus achieving a bumper harvest.
    The cotton in these three counties not only increased in yield compared to last year, but also improved in quality. The cotton in Turpan and Shanshan counties generally matured ten days earlier than last year, with pre-frost cotton reaching about 90%, and the color was white and the elasticity was strong.
　　Hebei
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric Dispatch: The people's communes in Shulu County, Cixian County, and Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, fully implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, ensuring a bumper harvest of cotton fields with an average yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Shulu County's 786,000 mu of cotton fields averaged 110 jin of ginned cotton per mu; Cixian County's 700,000 mu of cotton fields averaged nearly 101 jin per mu; and Shijiazhuang City's more than 253,000 mu of cotton fields averaged 101 jin per mu. Now, the broad masses of commune members in the three counties and cities are carrying out basic construction of cotton fields under the encouragement of the bumper harvest, striving to continue the great leap forward in cotton production next year.
    In order to win a greater cotton harvest next year, the communes in the three counties and cities have already begun to carry out various preparations for cotton planting. Based on the experience of this year's great cotton harvest, Cixian County has decided to universally promote high-yield plots next year, and has already planned 600,000 mu of cotton fields into squares, focusing on water, fertilizer, and soil, and carrying out basic construction on a large scale. One hundred and forty-seven pig farms have now been built in the squares, and another two hundred and fifty are planned to be expanded, so that every square has a pig farm to ensure the fertilizer supply for the cotton fields. In order to realize the water conservancy of the cotton fields, Shulu has sunk more than 750 machine wells in November, and opened more than 2,450 branch canals, so that the cotton fields are basically insured against drought and flood, and winter irrigation of cotton fields is now underway.
　　Sichuan
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch: In Shehong County, Sichuan Province, the county's 600,000 mu of cotton fields averaged 110 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year, an increase of more than 40% over last year. Due to the expansion of the planting area compared to last year, the total output increased by more than 60% compared to last year.
    In the Great Leap Forward last year, the county's average cotton yield per mu increased nearly doubled compared to 1957, reaching 77 jin. This year, it suffered a continuous four-month drought, the largest in thirty years, but relying on the great power of the people's communes, it still won an even greater harvest than last year.
　　Shandong
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Electric Dispatch: Linqing City, Shandong Province, has had a bumper cotton harvest. This year, the city planted more than 434,000 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 101 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Among them, there were also more than 100,000 mu of high-yield fields with a yield of 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

　　棉花高产遍四方
    一批县、市传来亩产皮棉超百斤的喜讯
    提前八年实现全国农业发展纲要规定的最高指标
　　新疆
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区吐鲁番、鄯善和麦盖提三县，棉花平均亩产量突破百斤皮棉大关。其中，吐鲁番县七万七千八百亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉一百三十斤，鄯善县六万三千亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉一百二十九点九四斤，麦盖提县六万七千多亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉一百三十五斤。
    吐鲁番、鄯善、麦盖提等三个县棉花丰收，是充分发挥人民公社的优越性，战胜各种灾害的结果。今年，吐鲁番县的棉花遭受到干旱的威胁；麦盖提县棉花在生长了三、四片叶子的时候遭到霜冻危害；同时，三个县的棉花都发生过红蜘蛛，地老虎等较大的虫害。但是，由于三个县的各民族农民在当地党组织领导下，成立了棉花专业队，专业组，抗灾保苗，加强田间管理工作，不断地和自然灾害作斗争，因而获得丰收。
    这三个县的棉花不但产量比去年增加，质量也比去年提高。吐鲁番和鄯善两个县的棉花，一般比去年提早成熟十天，霜前花达到90％左右，而且色泽洁白，弹性强。
　　河北
    据新华社天津电河北省束鹿、磁县和石家庄市各人民公社，全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”，保证棉田获得平均亩产皮棉百斤以上的大丰收。束鹿县七十八万六千亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉一百一十斤；磁县七十万亩棉田平均亩产将近一百零一斤；石家庄市的二十五万三千多亩棉田，平均亩产达到一百零一斤。现在，三县、市的广大社员，正在大丰收的鼓舞下，进行棉田的基本建设，力争明年棉花产量继续跃进。
    为了夺取明年棉花更大丰收，现在三县、市各公社已开始进行植棉的各项准备工作。磁县根据今年棉花大丰收的经验，决定明年普遍推行丰产方，现在已经把六十万亩棉田规化成方，正以水肥土为中心，大搞基本建设。现在已经在方内建起养猪场一百四十七个，计划再扩建二百五十个，达到方方有猪场，以保证棉田的肥料供应。束鹿为使棉田实现水利化，在11月就打成机井七百五十多眼，开好了支斗毛渠二千四百五十多条，使棉田基本上达到旱涝双保险，现在正在进行棉田冬灌。
　　四川
    据新华社成都电四川省射洪县全县六十万亩棉田，今年平均亩产皮棉一百一十斤，比去年增产四成多，由于种植面积也比去年扩大，总产量比去年增长六成多。
    这个县在去年大跃进中，全县棉花平均亩产比1957年增产近一倍，达到七十七斤。今年，这里遭受了持续四个月、三十年来最大的一次旱灾，但是，依靠了人民公社的巨大威力，依然夺得了比去年更大的丰收。
　　山东
    据新华社济南电山东省临清市棉花大丰收。今年全市种植棉花四十三万四千多亩，平均每亩产皮棉一百零一斤。其中，还出现了亩产皮棉二百斤的丰产田十万多亩。
