Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 8th: Guangdong Province, in its current winter water conservancy construction movement, is implementing the principles of "focusing on water storage, community management, and small-scale projects, combined with large, medium, and small-scale projects."

The province's winter water conservancy construction movement has entered its climax. Among the 50,600 water conservancy projects that have already started construction across the province, more than 40,000 are small-scale projects, and 445 are large and medium-sized key projects benefiting more than 10,000 mu of land. The vast majority of these projects are water diversion and storage projects, including 15 large reservoirs with a storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters, and 103 medium-sized reservoirs with a storage capacity of 10 million to 100 million cubic meters. With the exception of large-scale projects and some medium-sized key projects, which are undertaken by the province, special districts, and counties, the vast majority of small and medium-sized water conservancy projects are undertaken by the People's Communes.

Under the guidance of the principle of "focusing on water storage," various localities, in addition to constructing a large number of new water diversion and storage projects, are also doing everything possible to improve the water diversion and storage capacity of existing projects, such as raising the dams of existing reservoirs, expanding existing water intakes, and extending existing water diversion channels. On the basis of focusing on water storage, various localities are also paying special attention to taking rivers as the object, carrying out overall planning, comprehensive management, development, and utilization. The Tangxi Reservoir project in Raoping County is a comprehensive project that takes the Huanggang River as its object, comprehensively addressing river water hazards, irrigation, and power generation. It will control 50% of the Huanggang River's drainage area, which will not only solve the flood control and irrigation problems of 150,000 mu of farmland on both banks of the lower reaches, reducing waterlogging and drought disasters, but also generate 12,000 kilowatts of electricity, greatly supplying rural industrial and agricultural production with electricity.

On the basis of the widespread development of small-scale projects, various localities have actively established large and medium-sized key projects, and have paid attention to combining large, medium, and small-scale projects to gradually form a relatively complete water conservancy project system, so as to maximize the role of water conservancy projects in resisting major floods and droughts. For example, the Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station and Baipenzhu Reservoir and other large-scale projects in the upper and middle reaches of the Dongjiang River, together with medium-sized projects such as the Huangtian Reservoir and many other small-scale projects, as well as dike projects and soil and water conservation projects in the downstream areas, gradually form a relatively complete water conservancy system, which can initially control the river, so that these areas are free from the threat of floods and eliminate drought disasters.

In implementing the principle of "focusing on community management," various localities not only rely on the People's Communes to vigorously develop small-scale water conservancy projects, but also rely on the People's Communes to undertake medium-sized key projects, giving full play to the superiority of the People's Communes. Among the 33 key projects undertaken by Xingning County, with the exception of the excavation of the canal and the raising of the Heshui Reservoir project, which are undertaken by the county, the rest are all undertaken by the communes.

Because of the implementation of the principle of "focusing on community management," various localities not only easily allocate labor and organize large-scale collaboration, making construction actions rapid, but also easily solve the problem of raw materials. After the communes in the Shunde area of ​​Fanshun County formulated their water conservancy construction plans, they made overall plans and comprehensive arrangements as early as before the autumn harvest, and even during the busy autumn harvest, they could spare some labor to rush to repair water conservancy.

According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, a large-scale winter water conservancy construction movement is gradually unfolding in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

The Jerim League, Ulanqab League, Zhaowuda League, and Yikezhao League of the Autonomous Region have respectively established water conservancy movement headquarters led by the first secretary of the league party committee, and decided to transfer 30% to 45% of the labor force to strengthen the water conservancy front, work hard this winter and spring, and strive to complete 70% to 80% of the annual water conservancy construction tasks for 1960. Horqin Right Wing Rear Banner in Jerim League and Chifeng City in Zhao League are both focusing on the struggle against right-leaning ideology, boosting morale, and carrying out socialist education, striving to complete 90% of the annual tasks, so as to basically eliminate waterlogging disasters and basically achieve water conservancy in the coming year.

Now, the 300,000-strong army fighting on the water conservancy front, encouraged by the call of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, has more confidence and greater enthusiasm, and is starting from reforming tools and reforming technology to vigorously carry out high-efficiency movements and accelerate the progress of the project. The People's Communes in Liangcheng County have made full use of old materials and mobilized commune members to collect scattered materials, which has enabled the Shimengkou Reservoir construction site to realize vehicle-based operations, increasing work efficiency threefold. The "one-time peeling of frozen soil, continuous operation and rapid excavation" method created by 18 migrant worker collectives at the Shizuizi Reservoir in Helin County has increased the average excavation efficiency by 1.2 times.

Many banners, counties, and communes throughout the region, while concentrating their efforts on building large and medium-sized projects, are also mobilizing more labor to build more small-scale projects in a concentrated manner, and are focusing on projects that will benefit next spring. The Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner has focused on combating right-leaning ideology and boosting morale, and has conscientiously implemented the three main principles in water conservancy construction. In mountainous areas, it focuses on small-scale water storage projects and digging springs to eliminate waterlogging, and in areas with abundant water sources, it focuses on diverting water for gravity irrigation, achieving adaptation to local conditions. Since November 20, more than 1,500 people have been involved in the farmland water conservancy construction movement, and 11 canals and 3 interception projects have been completed. Two reservoirs are under construction, and more than 60,000 cubic meters of earth, stone, and sand have been completed.

    广东内蒙古全面兴修水利工程
    贯彻三主方针根除洪涝旱三害
    小型为主　大中小结合
    新华社广州8日电　广东省在目前的水利冬修运动中，贯彻执行了以蓄水为主、社办为主、小型为主和大中小型相结合的方针。
    这个省的水利冬修运动已经进入高潮。全省现已开工的五万零六百宗水利工程中，小型工程为四万多宗，受益万亩以上大、中型骨干工程为四百四十五宗。这些工程绝大部分是引蓄水工程，其中有库容一亿立方米以上的大型水库十五宗，库容一千万到一亿立方米的中型水库一百零三宗。全部工程除了大型工程和部分中型骨干工程，由省、专区和县举办之外，绝大部分中小型水利工程，都由人民公社举办。
    各地在以蓄水为主的方针指导下，除了新建大批引蓄水工程之外，还千方百计提高现有引蓄水工程的引蓄水能力，如加高原有水库大坝，扩大原有引水口，延长原有引水渠道等等。各地在以蓄水为主的基础上，还特别注意以河流为对象，进行全面规划，综合治理、开发和利用。饶平县汤溪水库工程，就是以黄岗河为对象，根治河流水害和灌溉、发电的综合性工程。它将控制黄岗河50％的流域面积，不仅可以解决下游两岸十五万亩农田的防洪、灌溉问题，减免水旱灾害；还可发电一万二千瓩，大量供应农村工农业生产用电。
    各地在小型工程遍地开花的基础上，积极兴办了大、中型骨干工程，并且注意使大中小型工程结合起来，逐步形成一个比较完整的水利工程体系，以便最大限度地发挥水利工程的作用，抵抗较大的水灾和旱灾。如东江流域上、中游地区的新丰江水电站和白盆珠水库等大型工程，与黄田水库等中型工程和其他许多小型工程，以及下游地区的堤防工程、水土保持工程结合起来后，逐步形成一个比较完整的水利体系，可以初步控制河流，使这些地区免除洪水威胁和消灭旱灾。
    各地在贯彻以社办为主的方针中，不仅依靠人民公社大办小型水利工程，而且依靠人民公社举办中型骨干工程，充分发挥人民公社的优越性。兴宁县兴办的三十三宗骨干工程中，除了开凿运河和加高合水水库工程由县主办之外，其余一律由公社主办。
    各地由于贯彻了以社办为主的方针，不仅容易调配劳动力，组织大协作，使施工行动迅速，而且容易解决原材料问题。番顺县顺德地区各公社在订出了水利建设规划之后，早在秋收前就统筹兼顾、全面安排，在秋收大忙中，也能抽出部分劳动力抢修水利。
    据内蒙古日报消息　一个规模宏大的冬修水利运动，正在内蒙古自治区逐步展开。
    自治区的哲里木盟、乌兰察布盟、昭乌达盟和伊克昭盟，分别由盟党委第一书记挂帅，成立水利运动指挥部，决定抽调30％到45％的劳动力，加强水利战线，大干一冬春，力争完成1960年全年水利建设任务的70％到80％。哲里木盟的科左后旗、昭盟的赤峰市都大抓反右倾、鼓干劲和社会主义教育这条纲，力争完成全年任务的90％，以便在明年基本消灭内涝灾害和基本实现水利化。
    现在，奋战在水利战线上的三十万大军，在内蒙古党委号召的鼓舞下，信心更足，干劲更大，并且从改革工具、革新技术入手，大搞高工效运动，加快工程进度。凉城县各人民公社充分利用旧材料，并发动社员搜集零星材料，已使石门口水库工地实现了车子化，提高工效三倍。和林县石嘴子水库由十八个民工集体创造的“一次揭冻皮、连环作业快速挖土”方法，平均提高了挖土工效一点二倍。
    全区许多旗县和公社，在集中力量修建大中型工程的同时，还发动更多的劳动力，突击兴建更多的小型工程，大抓明春受益的工程。莫力达瓦达斡尔族自治旗狠抓反右倾，大鼓干劲，在水利建设上认真贯彻三主方针，在山区以小型蓄水工程、掏泉除涝为主，在水源多的地区以引水自流灌溉为主，做到了因地制宜。从11月20日开始，有一千五百余人投入兴修农田水利运动，已修成渠道十一条、拦蓄工程三处，正在修的水库两座，已完成土石砂方六万多立米。
