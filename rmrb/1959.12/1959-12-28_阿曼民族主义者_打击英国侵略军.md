Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 26th: According to a report in today's "Evening News" in Cairo, Omani nationalists detonated landmines they had planted in the area between Awabi and Rastak, killing two British aggressor soldiers and wounding two others.

The newspaper also reported that another landmine exploded in the area between Sete and the Green Mountain, destroying an enemy vehicle.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 22nd: Newspapers here today published editorials supporting the struggle of the Omani people and welcoming the visit of the Imam of Oman's representative to Indonesia.

Today's "Eastern Star" pointed out that the Omani people are not only friends of the Indonesian people, but more importantly, they are comrades-in-arms of the Indonesian people, because they are both subjected to imperialist aggression and are equally resisting imperialism with all their strength.
