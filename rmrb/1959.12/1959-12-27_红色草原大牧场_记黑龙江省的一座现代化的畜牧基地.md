　　Red Grassland Great Ranch
　　——A Record of a Modernized Animal Husbandry Base in Heilongjiang Province
　　Li Shaohua
　　Overnight, the train traveled from Inner Mongolia to the Songnen Plain along the Binzhou Line. Looking out the window, there was a boundless grassland. Countless herds of cattle, horses, and sheep were slowly moving towards the grassland. The train had entered the grounds of the Red Grassland Ranch.
　　The ranch is so large that it includes five train stations along the Binzhou Line. The entire ranch covers three million mu, with twenty branch farms. It raises 7,100 dairy cows, 7,100 horses, more than 12,600 fine-wool sheep, 8,200 pigs, and a large number of yellow cattle, chickens, and ducks. It produces 15 million jin of milk annually. The Red Grassland is currently one of the largest state-owned ranches in the country.

　　Breeding Base for Improved Livestock
　　After getting off the train at Sártu Station and arriving at the general farm headquarters, a twenty-minute jeep ride led to the Yinlang Sheep Farm. Rows of sheep pens were filled with plump and lovely sheep, their wool thick and dense. Touching it felt like grabbing the thickest felt. The wool is fine and long, a high-quality raw material for woolen fabrics. The ranch's sheep are a new breed improved by crossbreeding Soviet Merino and Caucasian sheep with local sheep, resulting in high wool production and high reproductive rates. A local sheep produces only two or three jin of wool a year, while the ranch's improved sheep produce an average of more than nine jin. The breeder Cui Wancheng, with twelve years of sheep-raising experience, raises fifty-seven breeding rams. On average, each ram produces 27.3 jin of wool a year. Among them, ram number 311 is raised like a small calf, and its wool yield this year was forty-two jin. One lamb per ewe is usually a rare occurrence. However, at the Yinlang Sheep Farm, ninety ewes were injected with pregnant mare serum this year, resulting in one hundred and eighty lambs. Some sheep even had litters of three or four lambs. Ewe number 38315 had a litter of five female lambs.

　　Crossing the sheep farm to the stables, one sees tall, sturdy horses. They are full of meat and fat, with legs like pillars and hooves as large as small iron pots. When they raise their heads, the average person cannot reach the horse's head. This is a new horse breed bred by crossbreeding Soviet draft horses and Ardennes horses with local improved horse breeds. The pulling power of these horses is astonishing, requiring specially thickened ropes because one horse can pull carts weighing several thousand jin. However, these horses are particularly docile, standing when told and walking when told, never acting up.

　　Modernized Equipment
　　On the silage fields and hayfields, automatic harvesters and automatic rakes sped by. The blades flashed, and the abundant forage grass was cut and neatly arranged on the ground. The efficiency of one machine is unmatched by a hundred people. The processing of feed is even more interesting. In the feed processing and preparation workshop, there are vertical mills for grinding flour, universal crushers for crushing grains, grasses, and root crops, hammer mills, root crop crushers, and soybean cake crushers. As soon as the motor starts, any kind of feed is crushed. The feed for the cattle is heated, mixed with water, and yeast is added. After seven or eight hours, the feed emits a fruity fragrance. Cattle eating this feed never experience indigestion, and milk production has increased compared to the past. Some of the crushed feed is first sent to the distillery for fermentation and wine production, and then the distiller's grains are used to feed pigs.

　　The Red Grassland Ranch produces more than 87,000 jin of wool a year, piled together like a small mountain. It would take countless shearers a long time to process it all. However, during the shearing season, a visit to the shearing room reveals that it is just like a barbershop. A row of wooden platforms has twelve positions, each with a sheep waiting to be sheared. Twelve electric clippers buzzed, and the cloud-like wool rolled down along with the movement of the electric clippers. Each person shearing with electric clippers shears an average of twenty-five sheep a day, with the fastest shearing fifty-one sheep a day, increasing efficiency by 5.5 times compared to manual shearing. Going further into the cattle farm, the cowsheds have chimneys lined up, and each cowshed has a small tower, which are ventilation shafts and silage towers. The cowsheds are snow-white, and large windows let in plenty of light. Some cattle are drinking water from iron bowls as big as helmets. When the cow's mouth presses on the iron bowl, the switch opens, and water flows out with a splash; when the cow has had enough, it lifts its mouth, the switch closes automatically, and not a drop of water flows out. Looking out on the ranch, hundreds of cattle graze on the vast grasslands, but the herdsmen leisurely sit in a sheltered vehicle playing the huqin. They are not afraid that the cattle will run away or that they will enter the cornfields and damage the crops in the summer. It turns out that a new grazing method is being used here. The herdsman's vehicle is equipped with a storage battery connected to an iron wire surrounding the ranch. If a cow tries to walk outside the ranch, the herdsman presses a button, and the electric current makes the cow obediently return. This grazing method prevents the cattle from eating grass randomly, increases the utilization rate of the grassland, and saves labor. Previously, two people were needed to graze one hundred cattle, but now three herdsmen can graze five hundred cattle.

　　The dairy cows on the Red Grassland Ranch are mostly the domestically renowned Binzhou breed of dairy cows, which produce a lot of milk of high quality. One cow produces seventy or eighty jin of milk a day, and some produce over one hundred jin.

　　Conscientious Breeders
　　Twelve years ago, while the Liberation War was still going on, a state-owned ranch was established here, in what is now called the Xinghuo Cattle Farm. It was the starting point of the Red Grassland Ranch. At that time, it occupied only a little over 1,100 mu, and the total number of livestock on the farm was only a little over 1,300, which is less than the number of livestock in a people's commune's management district today. Although the scale of the ranch was so small at that time, the people who built the ranch knew that it was a ranch with great potential for development. The grass quality on the ranch is abundant, with an average of 160 to 240 jin of grass produced per mu per year. The protein content in the sheep grass is 4.4%, and the nutritional value of one jin of this sheep grass is equivalent to 0.42 jin of medium-quality oats. However, the main reason for the rapid development of the ranch is the enthusiasm and strong sense of dedication of the people here. This year, six young men and two girls at the Hongji Horse Farm raised one hundred foals, achieving a survival rate of 98%. Three foals were born unable to suckle, and young breeders Dong Baofu and Sun Shuqing, one holding the foal's neck and the other prying open its mouth to feed it milk. Because they were afraid that the foals would eat too much at once and get sick, and also afraid that the foals would not be full, they fed the foals lukewarm mare's milk every forty minutes. As soon as they saw a foal shivering, they quickly took off their own clothes and put them on the foal. The deeds of the Xinghuo Cattle Farm breeder Wang Decheng are equally touching. He works in the calf team. Calves that are seven days old are sent here to be raised. Since 1957, Wang Decheng has raised more than 1,500 calves, with only one death. He separates the calves with different physiques and controls the amount of milk fed to each one. He takes even more careful care of the sick calves. The calves he raises gain an average of 1.6 jin of weight per day, greatly exceeding the national standards.

　　A small ranch twelve years ago has now developed into one of China's important ranch bases. In the past three years alone, the ranch has shipped more than 5,000 head of breeding livestock to Guangdong, Tibet, Beijing, and Shanghai. In addition to milk and wool, this year the ranch also produced more than 56,000 jin of pork, 60,000 jin of eggs, and 22,000 jin of chicken for the country. This year there are more than 2,500 newborn calves, more than 1,100 foals, 5,600 lambs, and more than 10,000 piglets. The ranch mainly uses mechanized farm tools and has cultivated a total of 330,000 mu of grain and feed crops. The ponds produce hundreds of thousands of jin of fresh fish a year. The ranch can also boil local alkali and local niter, and processing plants and food factories are all available. If a banquet were to be held on this ranch, everything needed to make a rich feast, except for Sichuan peppercorns, pepper, and sea salt, could be made with the ranch's own products.

　　红色草原大牧场
　　——记黑龙江省的一座现代化的畜牧基地
　　李绍华
    一夜工夫，火车沿着滨州线从内蒙古驶进了松嫩平原。从车窗向外眺望，是一片一望无边的草原。数不清的牛群、马群、羊群正缓缓向草原走去。列车进入红色草原牧场的场地了。
    牧场太大了，单是场内就包括滨州线的五个火车站，全场占地三百万亩，有二十个分场。饲养的牲口有七千一百头奶牛，七千一百匹马，一万二千六百多只细毛羊，八千二百口猪，还有大量的黄牛、鸡、鸭。一年光是牛奶就生产一千五百万斤。红色草原目前是全国最大的国营牧场之一。
    良种畜群的繁殖基地
    在萨尔图火车站下车到总场部，再坐吉普车走二十分钟就到了银浪羊场。一排排的羊舍里，满是肥胖可爱的绵羊，身上的毛又密又厚，用手一摸，就像抓到了最厚的毛毡。羊毛又细又长，是上等毛哔叽的纺织原料。牧场的绵羊是苏联美利奴羊和高加索羊同当地羊杂交改良的新品种，产毛多，繁殖率高。一只当地绵羊一年不过产毛二、三斤，牧场的改良羊平均产毛九斤多。有十二年养羊经验的饲养员崔万成，他饲养的五十七只种公羊，平均每只羊一年产毛二十七斤三两，其中311号种公羊，养的像一只小牛犊似的，今年剪毛四十二斤。一羊一胎两羔通常是少见的现象。可是在银浪羊场，今年有九十只母羊，试行注射了妊娠马血清，产了一百八十个羊羔。还有的羊一胎三羔、四羔。38315号母羊，一胎产了五个母羊羔。
    穿过羊场来到马厩，就看到一匹匹高大的骏马。长的肉满膘肥，四条腿像四根桩子，大蹄子有小铁锅那样大小，扬起头来，一般身量的人伸手摸不到马的脑袋。这是用苏联挽马和阿尔登种马与本地良种马杂交育成的新马种。马的挽力大的惊人，绳套要特别加粗才行，因为一匹马能拉好几千斤重的车。可是这些马的性情却特别温和，叫站就站，叫走就走，从不使性子。
    现代化的设备
    在青贮饲料地和割草场上，自动割草机、自动搂草机飞驶而过，只见刀光闪闪，丰美的饲草，就被割倒齐整地排在地上。一台机器工作效率之高，一百个人也赶不上。饲料的加工处理更是有趣。在饲料加工调制车间，有磨面的立磨，粉碎粮谷、草类和块根的万能粉碎机，锤式粉碎机，块根粉碎机，豆饼粉碎机等。只要马达一响，不论什么样的饲料，就被粉碎了。喂牛的饲料，还要经过加温、加水，混入酵母，七、八小时以后，饲料就发出水果似的香味。牛吃这种饲料，从来没有过消化不良的现象，而且产奶量比过去提高了。粉碎好的饲料有的先送进酒厂，经过发酵、出酒，再用酒糟喂猪。
    红色草原牧场一年产羊毛八万七千多斤，堆在一起赶得上一座小山，不知要多少剪毛姑娘忙碌多久。可是在剪毛季节走进剪毛室里看看，这简直和理发馆一样，一列木台子上有十二个位子，位子上是一个个等待剪毛的羊。十二把电剪刀唰唰地响着，云絮似的羊毛，顺着电剪刀的移动，滚滚而下。电剪剪毛每个人平均一天剪羊二十五只，最快的一天剪羊五十一只；比人工剪毛提高效率五点五倍。再往牛场里去，牛舍里烟囱鳞次栉比，每个牛舍旁还有一个小塔。这原来是通风的气眼和青贮饲料塔。牛舍里一片雪白，大窗户透进来充足的光线。有的牛正在钢盔那么大的铁碗里喝水。牛嘴在铁碗里一压，开关打开，水哗哗地流了出来；牛喝够了，一抬嘴，开关自动关上，一滴水也流不出来。到牧场上一看，几百条牛在广阔的草原上吃草，放牧员却轻闲地坐在一辆带棚的车上摆弄胡琴，他们既不怕牛会跑散，夏天也不怕牛闯进玉米地里糟踏农田。原来这里采用了新的放牧法。放牧员坐的小车上，装有一个蓄电瓶，联着一根围绕牧场的铁丝。牛要向牧场外边走，放牧员一按电钮，电流就把牛打的乖乖地回来。这种放牧法，使牛不会到处乱吃草，提高草原的利用率，而且省人工。以前，一百头牛要两个人放牧，现在五百头牛只用三个放牧员就可以了。
    红色草原牧场的奶牛，大都是国内有名的滨州良种奶牛，产奶多，奶质好，一头牛一天产奶七十斤、八十斤；有的产奶一百来斤。
    兢兢业业的饲养员们
    十二年前，解放战争还在进行，一个国营牧场就在今天叫星火牛场的这里诞生了。它是红色草原牧场的起点。当时，它只占地一千一百多亩，全场牧畜加在一起只有一千三百多头，还赶不上今天人民公社一个管理区的牧畜多。虽然当时牧场的规模是那样小，但是建场的人都知道这是一个大有发展前途的牧场。牧场上草质丰美，平均每亩草地一年产草一百六十斤到二百四十斤；羊草中含蛋白质4.4％，一斤这样的羊草的营养价值相当于零点四二斤的中等燕麦。可是，牧场迅速发达的主要原因，还是这里人们的干劲和坚强的事业心。红骥马场六个小伙子和两个姑娘今年喂养一百匹小马驹，成活率达到98％。有三匹小马生下来不会吃奶，青年饲养员董保福和女饲养员孙淑清两人，一个搂着小马的脖子，一个搿开嘴喂奶。因为怕小马驹一次吃的太多撑坏了，又怕小马驹吃不饱，他们就每隔四十分钟给小马喂一次温和的马奶。一看到小马发抖，他们就赶快脱下自己的衣服给马驹披上。星火牛场饲养员王德成的事迹也同样动人。他在牛犊队工作。出生七天后的牛犊都送到这里饲养成长。从1957年以来，王德成饲养了一千五百多头牛犊，只有一头夭折。他把体质不同的小牛分开，一头头地掌握喂奶量。闹病的小牛，他照顾得更加细心。他养的牛犊平均每天增加体重一点六斤，大大超过了国家规定的指标。
    十二年前的一个小牧场，现在已经发展成为我国重要的牧场基地之一了。最近三年来，牧场向广东、西藏、北京、上海输送的种畜就有五千多头。除了牛奶、羊毛，牧场今年还给国家生产了五万六千多斤猪肉，六万斤鸡蛋，两万二千斤鸡肉；新生的牛犊今年有两千五百多头，马驹一千一百多匹，羊羔五千六百只，仔猪一万多头。牧场以机械化农具为主，共计耕种了三十三万亩粮食和饲料作物，水塘里一年生产几十万斤鲜鱼。牧场也还能熬制土碱、土硝，加工厂、食品厂样样俱全。在这个牧场里如果举行宴会，除了花椒、胡椒、海盐要买，全部用自己的产品就可以做出丰富的酒席来。（附图片）
