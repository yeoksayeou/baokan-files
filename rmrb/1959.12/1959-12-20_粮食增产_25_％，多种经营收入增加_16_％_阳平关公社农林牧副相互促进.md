Reported by our newspaper: The Yangpingguan People's Commune in Ningqiang County, Shaanxi Province, adhering to the principle of focusing on grain production and supplementing it with diversified operations, has achieved bumper harvests in both summer and autumn grains this year after more than a year of hard work. The total output increased by 25% compared to last year. After retaining enough grain for commune members' rations, they sold 3.7 million jin of grain to the state. As of the end of November, the total income from diversified operations reached 1.1 million yuan, an increase of 16% compared to last year, which basically solved the problems of food and money.

The abundant grain harvest has provided favorable conditions for the development of animal husbandry. On the basis of rationally adjusting the labor force, the production teams used the money from selling grain to purchase cattle, vehicles, and a large number of agricultural tools. They also bought improved varieties of pigs, sheep, and chickens from other places and established pig farms and livestock farms. At present, the number of pigs has doubled compared to last year's more than 4,800 heads, sheep have increased by 95%, and chickens have increased by 1.7 times. The nationally renowned Peking duck has also settled here. The development of agriculture and animal husbandry has provided a large amount of funds and raw materials for the development of industry. As a result, more than 30 factories, such as wineries, oil mills, grain processing plants, fiber factories, paper mills, brick and tile factories, and lime factories, have been established. This has also turned a large number of wild resources into useful social wealth. Furthermore, due to the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, the task of afforestation in mountainous areas has also been put on the agenda. The commune has used production gaps to organize a large number of laborers to plant trees and afforest 20,300 mu, initially controlling soil erosion.

The development of animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and forestry, in turn, has promoted the development of agriculture. The large-scale development of pigs, cattle, and sheep has provided a large amount of high-quality fertilizer for agriculture. The fertilizer accumulated from pig raising alone amounted to more than 38.66 million jin, which played a significant role in increasing grain production this summer and autumn. Moreover, due to the development of forestry and sideline occupations, public accumulation has increased, and agricultural tools have been added. For example, the Mutual Aid Production Team used public accumulation to buy five carts, repaired seven water mills, and bought 144 breeding pigs. The water mill processed more than 60,000 jin of bran, solving the problem of concentrated feed for the 185 pigs raised collectively. The Jiulian Production Team used the accumulated public funds to buy cattle, breeding pigs, chemical fertilizers, as well as mountain plows, hoes, and other production materials. As of mid-November, the total income from diversified operations in this team was 32,000 yuan, four times higher than last year. With the large-scale development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, by the end of November, the average income per household could reach 110 yuan, an increase of 11% compared to last year.

The above achievements were obtained after repeated struggles against conservative thinking. When the idea of ​​simultaneously promoting grain production and diversified operations was put forward, some cadres and commune members believed that "the labor force is tight, and it is difficult to carry out diversified operations," and erroneously opposed grain production to diversified operations. In addition to explaining the benefits of developing diversified operations to cadres and commune members, the commune party committee focused on adopting accounting comparison methods and using the popular saying of the masses, "Pigs fertilize the fields, and the fields feed the pigs," to enlighten and educate cadres and commune members, and correct their understanding. When contradictions arose in actual work regarding the use of labor, land, and funds for grain production and diversified operations, the commune adopted the following methods to solve them: (1) Transferring about 10% of the labor force to engage in diversified operations, and establishing specialized or temporary organizations according to their respective expertise, so that everyone can make the best use of their talents and be in the right place. At the same time, according to the production seasons and laws of grain production and diversified operations, labor is allocated in a planned and proportional manner, taking advantage of every opportunity to launch sudden attacks, so as to ensure that both grain production and diversified operations are not neglected. (2) Fully utilizing "marginal land" and abandoned land. (3) Regarding the issue of funds, adhering to the principle of self-reliance, adopting the method of planning, using, and accumulating simultaneously, supporting each other, and developing gradually. After adopting the above methods, the contradictions were adjusted.

However, soon the idea of ​​"four willingnesses" and "four unwillingnesses" appeared among some people: being willing to engage in large-scale, concentrated, quick-profit, and small-investment production; being unwilling to engage in small-scale, decentralized, long-term, and slow-profit production. In response to these ideas, the commune party committee launched mass discussions and debates, used factual evidence and detailed accounting methods to reason and criticize, carried out the socialist education movement, clarified some erroneous understandings, and unified thinking. Only in this way could a vigorous movement to vigorously develop diversified operations be rapidly launched, and a situation of comprehensive development and mutual promotion of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations could emerge.

The comprehensive and large-scale development of diversified operations has also greatly changed the economic and technical outlook of the entire commune. This year, the entire commune completed the task of purchasing and storing grain two months ahead of schedule, and exceeded the target by 10%; the purchase of agricultural products exceeded the target by 12.5%; rural savings increased by 5.2 times compared to last year; public accumulation increased by 88.5% compared to last year; labor remuneration increased by 47% compared to last year; and the volume of commodities also increased greatly. Pigs increased by 33.33%, tung oil increased by 193%, wild fiber increased by 64.4%, and cork increased by 20 times. The large-scale development of diversified operations has made the vast number of cadres and commune members more clearly define the direction of construction in mountainous areas, and increased their confidence and courage in accelerating the change of the poor and backward face of mountainous areas.

    粮食增产25％，多种经营收入增加16％
    阳平关公社农林牧副相互促进
    本报讯　陕西宁强县阳平关人民公社本着以粮食生产为主，其它多种经营为辅的方针，经过一年多的苦战，今年夏秋粮食都获得了大丰收；总产量比去年增长25％，除留足社员口粮外，缴售给国家粮食三百七十万斤。多种经营总收入，截至11月底，已达一百一十万元，比去年提高了16％，这样基本上解决了吃饭和用钱的问题。
    粮食丰收了，就为发展畜牧业提供了有利条件，各生产队在合理调整劳动力的基础上，用卖了粮食的钱，添置了耕牛、车辆和大量农具，并从外地买进了猪、羊、鸡等优良品种，开办了养猪场、畜牧场。目前猪已在去年的四千八百多头的基础上翻了一番，羊增加了95％，鸡增加了一点七倍。全国驰名的北京鸭也在这里落了户。农业和畜牧业的发展，为发展工业提供了大量的资金和原料，于是办起了酿酒厂、榨油厂、粮食加工厂、纤维厂、造纸厂、砖瓦厂、石灰厂等三十多处，这样还使大量野生资源变成了有用的社会财富。又由于农牧副业的发展，绿化山区的任务也被提到议事日程上来，公社利用生产空隙，组织大批劳力，植树造林二万零三百亩，初步控制了水土流失。
    牧、副、林的发展，反过来又促进了农业的发展。猪、牛、羊大发展后，为农业提供了大量优质肥料，光养猪积的肥就达三千八百六十六万多斤，这些肥料对今年夏秋粮食增产起了显著的作用。又由于林、副业的发展，公共积累增多，又添置了农具。例如互助生产队，利用公共积累买了五辆架子车，修了七盘水磨，买了一百四十四头种猪，水磨加工粮食共得麸皮六万多斤，解决了集体喂养的一百八十五头猪的精饲料问题。九联生产队用积累下的公共资金买了耕牛、种猪、化肥，以及山地犁、镢、锄等生产资料。截至11月中旬，这个队多种经营总收入三万二千元，比去年提高四倍。农林牧副业大发展，到11月底，每户平均收入可以达到一百一十元，比去年增加11％。
    上述成绩，是在和保守思想反复斗争之后取得的。当提出粮食生产和多种经营并举时，有些干部和社员认为：“劳力紧张，多种经营不好开展”等，错误地把粮食生产和多种经营对立起来。公社党委除向干部和社员解释发展多种经营的好处外，并着重采取了算账对比的方法和运用群众常说的“猪养田，田养猪”的道理，启发教育干部和社员，端正了认识。当实际工作中，出现了粮食生产和多种经营在劳力、土地和资金使用上的矛盾时，公社采取以下办法解决：（一）抽调10％左右的劳力从事多种经营，并按照各人专长，成立专业或临时组织，做到人尽其材，各得其所。同时根据粮食生产和多种经营生产节令、规律，有计划按比例的调配劳力、见缝插针、抽空突击，做到粮食生产和多种经营两不误。（二）充分利用“八边地”和荒废地。（三）资金问题，本着自力更生的原则，采取边规划，边使用，边积累的方法，相互支援，逐步发展。采用上述办法后，矛盾得到了调整。
    但不久在部分人中间又出现了“四愿”、“四不愿”的思想：愿搞大型的、集中的、赚钱快的、投资小的生产；不愿搞小型的、分散的、长远的、赚钱慢的生产。公社党委又针对这些思想，发动群众鸣放辩论，用摆事实，算细账的办法，进行说理批判，开展了社会主义教育运动，澄清了一些错误认识，统一了思想。这样才迅速掀起了大力发展多种经营的运动，出现了农林牧副全面发展，相互促进的局面。
    多种经营的全面大发展，也促使全公社的经济和技术面貌有了很大的改变。今年全公社征购粮入仓提前两个月，并且超额10％完成任务；农产品采购超额12.5％；农村储蓄比去年增长五点二倍；公共积累比去年提高88.5％；劳动报酬比去年提高47％；商品量也大大增加，猪增长33.33％，桐油增长193％，野生纤维增长64.4％，栓皮增长二十倍。多种经营大发展使广大干部和社员更进一步明确了山区建设的方向，对加速改变山区穷困落后面貌，增加了信心和勇气。
