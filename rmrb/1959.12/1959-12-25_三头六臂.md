　　"Three Heads and Six Arms"
　　Xiao Le

　　There are many characters with "three heads and six arms" in ancient legends, and there is also "Thousand-Handed Guanyin" in Buddhist stories. They originally did not exist. However, from these mythical figures, one can see the wishes of the ancient people: they wanted to grow more hands to do more things; grow more heads to think of more tricks.

　　The ancient people's wish, before the productive forces were greatly liberated, and in the long years when the working people were still treated like cattle and horses, was just a wish after all. Even if there were a few advanced figures, they were unable to do what they wanted, and they were alone. Only after the working people became masters of their own affairs could they truly turn fantasy into reality.

　　On Sunday, we did short-distance transportation at the new factory. Ten people had to transport 20 tons of coal in one day. Everyone was very enthusiastic, carrying and lifting. No one was willing to rest. They worked hard for half a day, and some comrades' shoulders were swollen from the pressure. But at noon, it was calculated that only five tons of coal had been transported. The remaining 15 tons of transportation task could only be rushed in the afternoon. Someone said discouragedly: "Unless everyone grows into 'three heads and six arms', otherwise we won't be able to transport it all in the afternoon." After lunch, everyone thought of a way to borrow ten wheelbarrows from a nearby construction site. One person, one cart, pushing it was light, it carried a lot, and it ran fast. As a result, just as the sun was setting in the west, the 15 tons of transportation task was completed. One comrade joked: "With the wheelbarrow, the efficiency is doubled. One person transporting coal is equivalent to three people. Isn't this really becoming 'three heads and six arms'?"

　　This reminds me that the liberation of mankind from the realm of ordinary animals in primitive society began with the ability of both hands to create simple tools, didn't it? Mankind has evolved from learning to use stone tools to copper and iron tools, and then to being able to use machines, electricity, and atoms. With the continuous emergence of new production tools, human society has moved forward. It can be said that the entire historical development process of society is also a process of continuous improvement and upgrading of production tools by people. Because the tools manipulated by mankind are becoming more and more advanced, the abilities of "three heads and six arms" and "thousand hands and thousand eyes" characters in ancient people's ideals have long become a reality.

　　Currently, to achieve a sustained leap forward and to build socialism at high speed, we need thousands upon thousands of "three heads and six arms" heroes. We must, on the existing basis, have one person do the work of two, three, or even more. Waging a large-scale technical revolution can enable us to do this. Many advanced workers and innovation experts reform production tools, completing ten years of work in one year, and one person doing the work of five people. This means that they are not only "three heads and six arms" heroes, but also "five heads and ten arms" heroes. If the people of the whole country are like them, our construction speed will be more than just a thousand miles a day, but ten thousand miles a day!

### “三头六臂”

　　“三头六臂”
　　晓乐
    古代传说里有不少“三头六臂”的人物，佛教故事里也有“千手千眼观士音”，他们本来是不存在的。但是，从这些神怪式的人物中，却使人看出古代人民的愿望：他们想让自己多长几只手，多做些事情；多长几个脑袋，多想些窍门。
    古人的这种愿望，在生产力没有得到大解放以前，在劳动人民还是作牛作马的漫长年代里，也总是一种愿望而已。即或有少数先进人物，也是力不从心，形单影只。真正能把幻想变成现实，只有到了劳动人民当家作主以后。
    星期天，我们在新建厂搞短途运输。十个人，一天要运完二十吨煤，大家干劲不小，挑的挑，抬的抬，谁也不肯休息，一气干了半天，有的同志肩膀也压肿了，可是中午一计算，才运完五吨煤。剩下的十五吨运输任务只有下午突击了，有人说泄气话：“除非大家都长成‘三头六臂’，否则下午怎么也运不完。”吃过中午饭，大家想办法在附近工地上借来十辆手推车，一人一辆，推起来轻巧，装的多，跑的快，结果日刚偏西，十五吨的运输任务就完成了。有位同志打趣说：“有了手推车提高工效二倍，一人运煤顶三人，这不真的成了‘三头六臂’了吗？”
    由此我联想起，原始社会人类从一般动物的领域里解放出来，不正是从双手能创造出简单的工具开始的吗？人类从学会使用石器到铜器、铁器，再进化到能使用机器、电气、原子，随着新的生产工具的不断产生，推动着人类社会往前发展。可以这样说，整个社会的历史发展过程，也就是人对生产工具不断改进提高的过程。由于人类操纵的工具一天天更加先进，古人理想中“三头六臂”“千手千眼”人物的本领，如今已早成为现实了。
    当前我们要实现持续跃进，要高速度建设社会主义，我们需要千千万万个“三头六臂”式的英雄，我们要在现有的基础上，一人干活顶两人、三人，甚至更多。大闹技术革命就能使我们做到这一点。有许多先进工人、革新能手改革生产工具，一年干完了十年的工作量，一个人顶五个人干活。这就是说，他们不止是“三头六臂”式的英雄，而且成了“五头十臂”的英雄了。如果全国人民都像他们那样，我们的建设速度，将不只是一日千里，而是一日万里了！
