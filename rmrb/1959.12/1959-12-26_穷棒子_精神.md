　　"Poor Stick" Spirit
　　Zhang Chunqiao
    Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in his editor's note to the first article in the book "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": In the cooperative movement in Zunhua County, there was a Wang Guofan cooperative, with twenty-three poor peasant households owning only three donkey legs, and they were called the "Poor Stick Cooperative". Through their own efforts, they "fetched from the mountains" a large amount of means of production within three years, moving some visitors to tears. I think this is the image of our entire country. Can't six hundred million poor sticks, through their own efforts over several decades, become a socialist country that is both rich and strong? The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and intellectual laborers themselves. As long as these people control their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line that does not evade problems but solves them with a positive attitude, any difficulties in the world can be solved.

    Whenever we encounter difficulties in our work, we often think of this "poor stick" spirit praised by Comrade Mao Zedong. Whenever we overcome difficulties and achieve success with this spirit, we become even more convinced that as long as we continue to emulate the comrades of the "Poor Stick Cooperative," using the revolutionary spirit of "fetching from the mountains," relying on our own efforts, doing everything possible, working diligently and thriftily, and attacking the earth, we will definitely be able to conquer the earth and build a strong country. The Great Leap Forward of 1958 and the continued leap forward of 1959 fully demonstrated that the six hundred million poor sticks under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party possess endless wisdom and countless "poor methods." "Poor methods lead to endless solutions"—this is the correct conclusion we have drawn from our own experience.

    However, some of our comrades do not think this way. Although they cannot deny that we belong to the poor stick category, they do not believe in the "poor methods lead to endless solutions" of the poor sticks, and they do not believe that using this revolutionary spirit, "any difficulties in the world can be solved." They say, "Poor methods are no methods," and "Poor methods are limited." Some say that poor methods were indispensable in the revolutionary war in the past, but they are no longer needed now. Their eyes are on "rich methods," and they always reach out to the state for this or that, otherwise, they cannot do this or that. Others use poor methods to succeed, such as "fetching from the mountains" large amounts of means of production, "ants gnawing at bones," "native chickens laying foreign eggs," small native groups, small foreign groups, etc. These poor methods have created brilliant achievements, placed before their eyes, but they are not moved to tears, but rather look at them with blind eyes, or shake their heads after looking at them: "It's always not as good as..."

    Whatever we proletarians and working people do, we can only start from scratch, that is, rely on poor methods to get started. Because we either have nothing or have very little. We are not ashamed to be called poor sticks. We are proud of the fact that because we are poor, we are the most determined, the most courageous, the most hardworking, and the most thorough in making revolution. During a considerable period of revolutionary struggle, we had no airplanes or artillery, only millet plus rifles. Even millet plus rifles were not abundant, and they mainly relied on the enemy's transportation teams to deliver them. "No food, no clothes, the enemy will send them to us; no guns, no cannons, the enemy will make them for us!" Doesn't this battle song of the Chinese People's Guerrilla still resound in our ears? Those who say "poor methods are no methods," please take a look at whether this is not a poor method with endless solutions? Is there any passive, pessimistic, "this cannot be done, that cannot be done" coward and lazy person's mood here? Doesn't it precisely prove that our poor method is the most thorough and revolutionary method? Of course, this does not mean that we do not develop the economy and build our own military industry at all. However, as Comrade Mao Zedong said at the end of the book "Strategic Issues of China's Revolutionary War": "We must build a military industry in such a way that it does not encourage dependence. Our basic policy is to rely on the military industry of imperialism and domestic enemies. We have the right to the armories in London and Hanyang, and they are delivered by the enemy's transportation teams. This is the truth, not a joke." It is precisely based on the truth indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong that the Chinese people and the People's Army seized weapons from the enemy, eliminated the enemy, strengthened themselves, and finally achieved the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War.

    Since in the struggle against the enemy, we used the poor method of seizing weapons from the enemy to eliminate the enemy and strengthen ourselves, then in the cause of production and construction, using the same poor method, "fetching from the mountains," fetching from ants gnawing at bones, fetching from small native groups and small foreign groups, continuing to attack the earth, conquering the earth, and building a strong country, is it not equally effective? In the struggle against the enemy, "No food, no clothes, the enemy will send them to us; no guns, no cannons, the enemy will make them for us!" In the struggle against nature, isn't it the same if we replace the word "enemy" with "nature"? We cannot wait for nature's alms, nor can we wait until we have "rich methods" before attacking nature. Poor methods are still the most revolutionary and thorough methods. They are the continuation of poor methods in revolutionary struggle and the development of our poor stick revolutionary spirit. Isn't this a fact?

    We have never been conservatives. The "poor methods" we are talking about do not mean that we don't use automatic rifles even if we have them, and we wholeheartedly use broadswords and spears. The "poor methods" we are talking about are a revolutionary spirit, a positive, enterprising, self-reliant spirit of overcoming difficulties, a indomitable poor stick spirit. With this spirit, we can stand on the same position with six hundred million "poor sticks," and we can see that broadswords and spears will inevitably be transformed into automatic rifles, a seedling will inevitably grow into a big tree, and new forces will inevitably defeat corrupt forces. "Poor methods lead to endless solutions," because poor methods are the methods by which hundreds of millions of people, under the leadership of the Party, become aware, organized, united, and liberate themselves by their own hands, the methods of transforming the infinite hope of the people into magnificent reality, and the methods of new forces defeating corrupt forces. In the future, when we are rich and strong, and we are no longer poor sticks, but the struggle between people and nature is endless. The advanced, sophisticated, and cutting-edge achievements we pursue today will be transformed into small native groups and small foreign groups, ants gnawing at bones, and millet plus rifles of that time, becoming the poor methods of that time. Thinking about problems in this way, we are even more convinced that even when "our fathers get rich," we must still maintain the revolutionary spirit of the "poor stick," we must still "live rich days as poor days," adopt the poor methods of that time, solve the problems of that time, and strive to create a better and happier life. It can be seen that the poor stick spirit is our proletarian revolutionary spirit, and poor methods are our proletarian revolutionary methods. This kind of poor method is not a temporary expedient, but a method that is useful for thousands of years.

### “穷棒子”精神

　　“穷棒子”精神
　　张春桥
    毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书的头一篇文章的按语中写道：遵化县的合作化运动中，有一个王国藩合作社，二十三户贫农只有三条驴腿，被人称为“穷棒子社”。他们用自己的努力，在三年时间内，“从山上取来”了大批的生产资料，使得有些参观的人感动得泪。我看这就是我们整个国家的形象。难道六万万穷棒子不能在几十年内，由于自己的努力，变成一个社会主义的又富又强的国家吗？社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。
    每当在工作中遇到困难，我们常常想起毛泽东同志所赞扬的这种“穷棒子”精神。每当我们用这种精神战胜了困难，取得了成就，我们就更加深信：只要我们继续像“穷棒子社”的同志们那样，用“从山上取来”的革命精神，自力更生，千方百计，克勤克俭，向地球进攻，我们就一定能够战胜地球、建立强国。1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进，充分证明了中国共产党领导下的六万万穷棒子有着无穷无尽的智慧，有着层出不穷的“穷办法”。“穷办法办法无穷”，这就是我们从自己的亲身经验中得出的正确结论。
    我们也有一些同志并不这样想。他们虽然也无法否认我们是属于穷棒子一类，但是，他们不相信穷棒子的“穷办法办法无穷”，不相信用这种革命精神办事，“任何人间的困难总是可以解决的”。他们说：“穷办法就是没办法”，“穷办法办法有限”。有人说穷办法在过去的革命战争中是非用不可，现在已经用不到了。他们的眼睛向着“富办法”，动不动就是向国家伸手要这要那，不然就是这也办不到，那也办不到。别人用穷办法办到了，比如，“从山上取来”大批生产资料，“蚂蚁啃骨头”，“土鸡下洋蛋”，小土群，小洋群，等等，这些穷办法创造了光辉灿烂的成就，摆在他们眼前，他们不但没有感动得下泪，而是睁着眼不看，或者看了以后摇脑袋：“总归不如……”。
    我们无产阶级和劳动人民不论办什么事情，都只能白手起家，也就是靠穷办法起家。因为我们或者一无所有，或者有也不多。说我们是穷棒子，我们并不脸红。我们引以为荣的是，正因为我们穷，我们才最坚决、最勇敢、最刻苦、最彻底地闹革命。在相当长时期的革命斗争中，我们没有飞机大炮，只有小米加步枪。就是小米加步枪，也并不充裕，而且主要靠敌人的运输队送来。“没有吃，没有穿，自有那敌人送上前；没有枪，没有炮，敌人给我们造！”这支中国人民游击队的战歌，不是还在我们的耳边响吗？说“穷办法就是没办法”的人，请看一看这不是一条办法无穷的穷办法吗？这里难道有一点消极的、悲观的、这也办不到、那也办不到的懦夫和懒汉的情绪吗？难道不恰恰证明我们的穷办法是最彻底最革命的办法吗？当然，这并不是说我们根本不去发展经济、建立自己的军事工业。但是，正如毛泽东同志在“中国革命战争的战略问题”一书的结尾所说：“我们建立军事工业，须使之不助长依赖性。我们的基本方针是依赖帝国主义和国内敌人的军事工业。伦敦和汉阳的兵工厂，我们是有权利的，并且经过敌人的运输队送来。这是真理，并不是笑话。”中国人民和人民军队，正是依据毛泽东同志所指示的这条真理，从敌人手里夺取武器，消灭了敌人，壮大了自己，终于取得了中国人民革命战争的伟大胜利。
    既然在对敌斗争中，我们用从敌人手里夺取武器消灭敌人的穷办法，消灭了敌人，壮大了自己；那末，在生产建设事业中用同样的穷办法，“从山上取来”，从蚂蚁啃骨头中取来，从小土群、小洋群中取来，继续向地球进攻，战胜地球，建立强国，难道不是同样有效吗？在对敌斗争中，“没有吃，没有穿，自有那敌人送上前；没有枪，没有炮，敌人给我们造！”在对自然作斗争中，把“敌人”两个字换成“自然界”不是一样吗？我们不能等待自然界的施舍，也不能等待有了“富办法”以后再向自然界进攻，穷办法仍然是最革命最彻底的办法，它是革命斗争中的穷办法的继续，是我们穷棒子革命精神的发展，这难道不是事实吗？
    我们从来不是保守主义者。我们所说的“穷办法”，并不是有了自动步枪也不用，一心一意使用大刀长矛。我们说的“穷办法”，是一种革命精神，一种积极的、进取的、自力更生、战胜困难的精神，一种百折不挠的穷棒子精神。有了这种精神，就能够同六万万“穷棒子”站在同一个立场看问题，就可以看到大刀长矛必将转化为自动步枪，一棵幼芽必将长成大树，新生力量必将胜战腐朽力量。“穷办法办法无穷”，因为穷办法就是亿万人民群众在党的领导下，觉悟起来，组织起来，团结起来，自己动手解放自己的办法，就是把人民群众的无穷希望转化为壮丽现实的办法，就是新生力量战胜腐朽力量的办法。到了将来，我们又富又强了，我们不再是穷棒子了，但是，人同自然界的斗争是无止境的，我们今天所追求的高级的、精密的、尖端的成就，又转化为那时的小土群、小洋群，那时的蚂蚁啃骨头，那时的小米加步枪，成为那时的穷办法。这样想问题，我们就更加深信：就是到了“老子阔起来了”，我们也仍然要保持“穷棒子”的革命精神，我们也仍然要“富日子当穷日子过”，采取那时的穷办法，解决那时的问题，为创造更美好更幸福的生活而斗争。可见，穷棒子精神就是我们无产阶级的革命精神，穷办法就是我们无产阶级的革命办法。这种穷办法并不是一时的权宜之计，而是千秋万岁用处无穷的。
