    How to Raise Pigs in the Cold Season
    Cooked Food, Warm Water, Warm Pens
    The weather is gradually getting colder, and sometimes the climate changes greatly. Under such circumstances, diseases such as hog cholera, swine fever, piglet dysentery, and sow abortion are more likely to occur. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the feeding and management of pigs.
    In cold weather, pigs should be fed cooked food and warm water, because pig saliva contains amylase, which makes it easier to digest cooked starch; eating raw food and cold water will also consume more heat in the body. Pregnant sows are especially unsuitable for eating raw food and cold water. When using leftover food to feed pigs, or collecting aquatic plants as feed, pay attention to cooking them thoroughly, because these things often carry germs or parasite eggs, and pigs are prone to infection when they eat them. In addition, the feed should be properly matched and diversified; otherwise, some nutrients will be excessive and some will be insufficient. If the feed lacks protein, minerals, etc., piglets will develop edema. Pregnant sows are prone to abortion if they eat too much sugar residue, distiller's grains and other feeds.
    As the saying goes, "There is no trick to raising pigs, just keep the pens dry and the pigs well-fed." It is very important to keep the pens dry. To keep the pens clean and dry, drainage work inside and outside the pens should be done well, feces and urine should be removed early and late, bedding should be changed frequently, and troughs and buckets should be washed clean after each use. The troughs and buckets and other utensils should be exposed to the sun often. The udders of lactating sows must also be kept clean to prevent piglets from contracting white dysentery.
    Both large and small pigs need to be taken to the yard every day for activities and sunbathing, which can increase the amount of vitamin D in the animals; it can also exercise their muscles and bones, promote balanced physical development, and enhance their resistance to cold.
    In winter, more attention should be paid to the actions and postures of pigs. If any problems are found, they should be isolated immediately, and lime should be sprinkled in the pigsty for disinfection. A regular disinfection system should be established for managing pigsties.

    寒冷季节　怎样养猪
    熟食  温水  暖栏圈
    天气渐渐冷起来了，而且有时气候变化很大。在这种情况下，猪瘟、猪肺疫、小猪白痢，以及孕猪流产等疾病，都比较容易发生。因此，对猪的饲养管理要特别注意。
    天气冷，要给猪喂熟食温水，这是因为猪的唾液里含有淀粉酶，容易消化熟淀粉；吃生食冷水，还会多消耗体内的热量。怀孕的母猪，特别不宜吃生食冷水。用饭菜残渣喂猪，或捞水草作饲料，要注意煮熟，因为这些东西常常带有病菌或寄生虫卵，猪吃了容易感染疾病。此外，饲料要配合得恰当，做到多种多样；否则，营养成分就会有的过多，有的过少。如果饲料中缺少蛋白质、矿物质等，小猪就会生水肿病。孕猪多吃了糖渣、酒糟等饲料就容易流产。
    俗话说：“饲猪没巧，栏干食饱。”可见经常保持栏内干燥是很重要的。要使栏内清洁、干燥，就要做好栏内外的排水工作，早晚清除粪尿，勤换褥草，槽桶每次用后洗刷干净，常把槽桶和其他用具放在太阳下曝晒。哺乳母猪的乳房也须保持清洁，以防止小猪感染白痢病。
    大小猪每天都需要放到场地上去活动一下，晒晒太阳，这样可以增加牲畜体内的丁种维生素；还可以锻炼筋骨，使身体发育均衡，并增强对寒气的抵抗力。
    冬季养猪更要注意猪的行动、姿态。发现猪有毛病，就需立即隔离，并在猪栏里撒上石灰消毒。管理猪栏，要建立定期消毒制度。
