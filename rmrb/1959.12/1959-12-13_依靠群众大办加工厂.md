　　After the victorious conclusion of the autumn harvest this year in Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, a "small autumn harvest" movement to extract treasures from the deep mountains immediately followed. After half a month, the entire county collected 607.8 million catties of mountain products, with processed output value reaching 3.5 million yuan. The combined income was 26 million yuan, exceeding the county's total grain income for the year.

　　Jianhe County is a resource-rich mountainous area of ​​the Baili Mountains and a multi-ethnic area with abundant forest resources and numerous wild plants. The county covers an area of ​​more than 4 million mu. Excluding cultivated land, rivers, roads, residences, and other areas accounting for approximately 1 million mu, the area of ​​contiguous and scattered wild plants is approximately 3 million mu. After the autumn harvest movement this year, the county party committee, based on the instructions of the state party committee, analyzed the county's resource situation and issued instructions to "extract treasures from the deep mountains and return all treasures to the granary." It called on the county to make persistent efforts, launch a second autumn harvest movement, and strive to increase income by an additional 50 yuan per person beyond the plan. The county party committee's instructions received a warm response from the broad masses of commune members, who declared, "The mountains are vast, but our determination is greater; the mountains are high, but our ambition is higher. We will definitely cross high mountains and dense forests and not stop until we have collected all the mountain products." More than 80,000 people were organized to go into the mountains throughout the county.

　　The extraordinary harvest of mountain products has led to a large-scale mountain product processing movement. From government offices to schools, from towns to villages, the production of tannin extract, winemaking, alkali refining, and starch production has become a mass movement. As of November 10, the county had successively established more than 11,800 processing plants and workshops, including tannin extract factories, starch factories, alkali factories, saltpeter factories, wineries, and oil pressing factories. These factories produced 900,000 catties of tannin extract, more than 10 million catties of starch, 60,000 catties of alkali, 80,000 catties of saltpeter, 400,000 catties of white wine, 1.73 million catties of oil, and 6,000 catties of sugar. The county's mountain product processing movement is continuing to develop. Preliminary experience is as follows:

　　First, to launch a mass "small autumn harvest" movement, it is necessary to educate the masses about the significance of vigorously promoting the "small autumn harvest" in supporting national construction. Wild plants such as Qinggang bowls (acorn shells) can be used to extract tannin extract; Qinggang malizi (chestnut-leaved oak seeds) can be processed into starch or wine, which can save a large amount of grain for the country.

　　Through positive education, the broad masses of cadres and people actively engaged in the collection and processing movement. More than 2,000 processing plants and stations were quickly established.

　　Second, secretaries take the lead, party members and league members act as pioneers, carry out experiments at all levels, and overcome technical difficulties. The county harvested so many mountain products, but the masses only knew how to process tung oil seeds and did not know how to process and utilize Qinggang malizi. To solve technical problems, Zhao Linzeng, the first secretary of the county party committee, personally took charge of a starch factory and a tannin extract factory to specialize in the processing and utilization of mountain products. Then, he convened an on-site meeting to teach the technology to the first secretaries of the commune party committees. The commune first secretaries returned and, taking the commune as a unit, convened meetings of cadres above the production team leader level to disseminate the technology. According to incomplete statistics, from the county party committee to the grassroots, 271 secretary starch factories and 88 tannin extract factories have been established. At the same time, the county party committee also transferred more than 20 experienced employees from the offices to Xinliu, Taiyong, and other places to provide technical guidance, so that processing technology could be quickly popularized.

　　Third, after cadres and the masses mastered the processing technology, the county party committee put forward the slogan "one pot per household, one factory per three households" and assigned the processing tasks to the small teams on a ten-day basis. For example, the Shidong Commune used only three days on October 24 to build 3,642 processing stations, an average of one processing station for every two households. Each of the commune's 170-plus canteens had a processing station built next to it. In tannin extract refining, the method of "mainly indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods" was generally adopted. The tannin extract was of good quality after testing.

　　Fourth, carry out appraisals and competitions, and vigorously promote high efficiency and high quality movements. At the beginning, processing and production efficiency was not high. The Shuijing management area of ​​the Taigong Commune produced only 30 catties of starch per person per day. After launching the red flag appraisal competition, both work efficiency and product quality were greatly improved. For example, the Shidong Commune processed 85 catties of starch from every 100 catties of Qinggang seeds, and the quality of the tannin extract was also very good.

　　In short, this collection and processing movement has not only provided the necessary raw materials for national industrial construction, but has also greatly increased the income of commune members, and has also trained cadres and the masses, changing the erroneous perception of many people that "Jianhe is backward, a poor mountain."

    依靠群众大办加工厂
    中共剑河县委书记处书记　王广立
    今年贵州省剑河县在秋收胜利结束以后，紧接着又出现了一个向深山取宝的“小秋收”运动，经过半个月的时间，全县采集山货达六亿零七十八万斤，已加工产值达三百五十万元，两项收入二千六百万元，超过了今年全县粮食总收入。
    剑河县是一个资源丰富的百岭山区，也是一个民族杂居的地区，有丰富的林木资源，有大量的野生植物。全县面积约有四百多万亩，除耕地面积、河流道路、住宅等约占地一百万亩以外，成片和零星的野生植物面积约有三百万亩。今年秋收运动结束后，县委根据州委的指示分析了全县的资源情况，发出了“向深山取宝、叫百宝归仓”的指示，号召全县再接再厉，大搞第二次秋收运动，争取计划以外每人再增加收入五十元。县委的指示得到了广大社员的热烈响应，他们提出“山大没有我们决心大，山高没有我们的志气高；一定跨过高山丛岭，收尽山货才收兵”。在全县范围内，组织上山的就有八万多人。
    山货的特大丰收，又出现了一个大规模的山货加工运动，从机关到学校，从城镇到农村，生产栲胶、酿酒、炼土碱、搞淀粉等，已成为群众性的运动。到11月10日止，全县先后建立的加工厂和作坊共一万一千八百多个，包括栲胶厂、淀粉厂、土碱厂、火硝厂、白酒厂、榨油厂，共生产栲胶九十万斤，淀粉一千多万斤，土碱六万斤，火硝八万斤，白酒四十万斤，油脂一百七十三万斤，食糖六千斤。现在全县山货加工运动正继续开展。初步经验如下：
    一、开展群众性的“小秋收”运动，首先要教育群众认识大搞“小秋收”对于支援国家建设的意义。野生植物如青杠碗（橡子壳）可炼出栲胶；青杠麻栗籽可以用来加工成淀粉，也可以用来加工成酒，这样，就可以为国家节约大量粮食。
    通过正面教育，广大干部和群众积极地投入了采集加工运动。很快地就建立加工厂和点两千多个。
    二、书记上阵，党团员打先锋，层层搞试验，度过技术关。全县收了这么多的山货，群众只会加工处理桐茶籽，不会加工利用青杠麻栗。为了解决技术问题，县委第一书记赵林增亲自掌握一个淀粉厂和栲胶厂，专门研究山货的加工利用。然后召开现场会，把技术教给公社党委第一书记。公社第一书记回去，以社为单位召开生产队长以上的干部会议，传播技术。据不完全统计，从县委到基层，已建立书记淀粉厂二百七十一个，炼胶厂八十八个。同时县委还从机关抽调二十多个比较老练的职工到新柳、太拥等地去作技术指导，使加工技术很快的得到普及。
    三、干部群众都掌握了加工技术后，县委提出了“一户一锅，三户一厂”的口号，把加工任务按旬逐层交给小队去承担。如施洞公社10月24日只用三天时间就建了三千六百四十二个加工站，平均每两户建立了一个加工站，全社一百七十多个食堂，每个食堂边都建有一个加工站。在炼胶方面，一般都采取了“以土法为主，土洋结合”的办法，栲胶经过鉴定，质量很好。
    四、开展评比，大搞高工效和优质运动。开始加工生产效率不高，台拱公社水井管理区一天一人只生产淀粉三十斤。开展红旗评比竞赛后，工效和产品质量都大大提高。如施洞公社每一百斤青杠籽加工出八十五斤淀粉，栲胶质量也很好。
    总之，这次的采集加工运动，不仅为国家工业建设提供了必需的原料，而且大大地增加了社员收入，同时也锻炼了干部和群众，改变了很多人认为“剑河落后，高山穷山”的错误观念。
