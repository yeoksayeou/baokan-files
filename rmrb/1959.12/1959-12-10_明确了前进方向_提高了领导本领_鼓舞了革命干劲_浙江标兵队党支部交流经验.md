    Clarifying the Direction of Progress, Enhancing Leadership Skills, Inspiring Revolutionary Enthusiasm:
    Zhejiang Pace-Setting Team Party Branch Exchanges Experiences
    (Our report) From early October to late November, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Party Committees and the Zhoushan County Party Committee successively convened working meetings of the Party branches of pace-setting production teams of the people's communes. Two hundred and seven branch secretaries of pace-setting production teams participating in the meetings studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Through the methods of "listening, observing, comparing, and learning," they visited thirty-one pace-setting production team Party branches, summarized and exchanged advanced experiences of rural Party branches in adhering to putting politics in command, leading production, and strengthening the ideological and organizational construction of Party branches. Finally, they proposed initiatives to the production team Party branches in each region, calling for greater efforts and striving for continued leaps forward. Now, the revolutionary competition upsurge of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and helping the backward" among the production team Party branches has unfolded throughout the province.
    This spring, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committees, in conjunction with the rectification of the people's communes, further rectified the rural Party grassroots organizations and strengthened the Party's leadership over the production teams. Responsible cadres of Party committees at all levels went deep into the production teams to lead production and, in their work, summarized the working experience of a batch of advanced production team Party branches. Subsequently, Party committees at all levels seized the advanced pace-setting branches in their respective regions and launched the competition movement of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and helping the backward." Recently, in order to fully exchange the experiences of these pace-setting branches and push this movement to a new high tide, the local Party committees successively convened working meetings of the pace-setting production team Party branches in their respective regions.
    Through studying documents, on-site visits, and exchanging experiences, the representatives were given a vivid and profound education in socialism and communism. They deeply realized that there are still struggles between two roads and two lines in the countryside. In this tortuous, complex, and sometimes quite sharp struggle, the rural Party organizations must adhere to the socialist direction, hold high the red flag of the General Line, and maintain close ties with the masses at all times, so as to win the victory in the struggle and resolutely implement and realize the Party's line. The Party branch of Wanshi Production Team of Xindeng Commune in Tonglu County has experienced fifteen sharp and complex struggles from the establishment of mutual aid teams to the people's commune. However, they have always adhered to the socialist direction, united the broad masses, and repelled the attacks of reactionary forces and wealthy peasants, thereby achieving an all-round great leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In 1957 and 1958, it was twice rated as a national advanced collective in agriculture. This year, the average yield of rice per mu in this production team reached 1,106 jin, an increase of 25% over last year, and silkworm cocoons increased by 70% over last year. The Party branch of Tianliao Production Team of Panxi Commune in Jinyun County constantly overcame right-leaning conservative ideas, set high aspirations, and led the masses to change the impoverished mountain village of "mountains in front, gullies in the back, ten households suffering hardship" into a happy new countryside of "mountains in front, gullies in the back, singing and dancing, ten households becoming wealthy." Through vivid facts, the representatives deeply realized that strengthening the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the revolutionary cause, and they resolved to give full play to the core leadership role of the Party branch and become a fighting fortress for building a new socialist countryside.
    The meeting also summarized the leadership methods and experiences in ideological construction and organizational construction of the pace-setting Party branches. The main experience of the branch leadership is to give full play to the core leadership role of the Party branch and the exemplary leading role of Party members; resolutely rely on the masses, maintain close ties with the masses, adhere to the working method of the mass line in everything, and vigorously carry out mass movements; adhere to the principle of democratic centralism of the Party, establish a leadership system combining collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility; strengthen the Party branch's leadership over the Communist Youth League, women, militia, and other organizations, and give full play to the role of these organizations. In terms of ideological construction and organizational construction, the main tasks are to strictly enforce Party organizational life, improve the Party lesson education system, urge Party members to learn culture and technology, and frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism to continuously improve the political and ideological level and cultural level of Party members and enhance Party unity; at the same time, it is necessary to conscientiously cultivate activists, develop new Party members in accordance with the policy of active and prudent approach, and do a good job in the education, examination, and conversion of probationary Party members, and continuously expand the Party ranks. For example, the Party branch of Fusheng Production Team of Fusheng Commune in Shaoxing County maintains close contact with and relies on the masses. They seek help from the masses when they encounter difficulties, seek technical research from veteran farmers, seek help from poor peasants when there are storms, and frequently pay door-to-door visits and hold Zhuge Liang meetings. For another example, the Party branch of Jiangshan Production Team of Yonglin Commune in Yongjia County has adhered to the Party's life system for six years, constantly improving the living standards of Party members through inspecting work and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Some Party branches have set up night Party schools and insisted on the Party lesson system, while others have set up spare-time schools that combine politics, culture, and technology to improve the political and ideological level and the cultural and technical level of Party members and the masses. These experiences educated every Party branch secretary who attended the meeting and played a significant role in improving their leadership ability.
    The meeting further emancipated the minds of the representatives, broadened their horizons, and strengthened their confidence and determination to continue to achieve a leap forward. They realized that in order to implement the Party's General Line, it is necessary to constantly pay attention to overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas and complacency. Some representatives originally thought that the production team they led was the most advanced. This time, by comparing the advanced with the advanced and the pace-setters with the pace-setters, they saw the strengths of other branches with their own eyes and expressed that they would redouble their efforts, catch up quickly, and strive for greater leaps forward. They said: "In the past, if we didn't see it, we wouldn't believe it; if we didn't see it, we wouldn't listen. Now, the more we see, the more motivated we are." For example, some Party branch representatives from the Jiaxing Plain area used to think that the mountainous areas were inferior to the plains. However, when they visited the Zhucun Production Team of the Tingzi Commune in Lin'an County, they saw that this impoverished mountain village before liberation, thanks to the Party branch's resolute implementation of the Party's General Line and mobilizing the commune members to strive to change the face of the poor mountain village, achieved a rice yield of more than 1,300 jin per mu this year, and the whole team raised an average of two pigs per mu. They caught up with and even surpassed the plain areas. Many representatives expressed on the spot that they would learn from the Zhucun Party branch. For another example, Chu Shouming, the Party branch secretary of Jiaoshan Production Team of Xin'anjiang Commune in Jiande County, originally thought that his production team was the pace-setter in the county and was almost there. However, when he saw that more than one million mulberry trees had been planted on the mountains of Wanshi Production Team of Xindeng Commune in Tonglu County, and that Yinzhu Production Team of Yinzhu Commune in Tonglu County was vigorously developing spring flower bumper harvest paddies and cultivating grass seeds, he said: "The more I see, the more anxious I become; the more I see, the more I feel that my production team is far behind."
    After the initiative of the pace-setting production team Party branches in various regions was put forward, a mass competition movement of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward" among the rural Party branches immediately unfolded vigorously throughout the province.

    明确了前进方向　提高了领导本领　鼓舞了革命干劲
    浙江标兵队党支部交流经验
    本报讯　中共浙江省各地委和舟山县委，从10月上旬到11月下旬，先后召开了人民公社的标兵生产队党支部工作会议。参加会议的二百零七个标兵生产队党支部的支部书记，在会议期间学习了党的八届八中全会文件，并通过“听、看、比、学”的方法，分别参观了三十一个标兵生产队党支部，总结和交流了农村党支部坚持政治挂帅、领导生产、加强党支部思想建设和组织建设等方面的先进经验，最后又分别向各地区生产队党支部提出了鼓足更大干劲、争取继续跃进的倡议。现在，生产队党支部相互间的“学先进、赶先进、超先进、帮后进”的革命竞赛热潮，已经在全省范围内展开。
    浙江省各级党委在今年春天结合整顿人民公社，进一步整顿了农村党的基层组织，加强了党对生产队的领导。各级党委的负责干部深入到生产队去领导生产，并且在工作中总结了一批先进生产队党支部的工作经验。随后，各级党委都抓住了本地区的先进标兵支部，开展了“学先进，赶先进、超先进、帮落后”的竞赛运动。最近，为了充分交流这些标兵支部的经验，把这一运动推向新的高潮，各地委又先后召开了本地区的标兵生产队党支部工作会议。
    通过学习文件，现场参观和交流经验，到会代表受到了一次生动而深刻的社会主义和共产主义的教育。他们深刻地认识到：目前在农村中还存在着两条道路和两条路线的斗争，在这场曲折复杂有时又相当尖锐激烈的斗争中，农村的党组织必须坚持社会主义方向，高举总路线红旗，时刻和群众保持血肉的联系，才能在斗争中取得胜利，坚决贯彻和实现党的路线。桐庐县新登公社万市生产队党支部，从成立互助组到人民公社，经历过十五次尖锐复杂的斗争，但他们始终坚持了社会主义方向，团结广大群众，击退了反动势力和富裕农民的进攻，从而获得了农林牧副渔全面大跃进，1957年和1958年连续两次被评为全国农业先进集体单位。今年这个生产队的水稻每亩平均产量达到了一千一百零六斤，比去年增长了25％，蚕茧比去年增长了70％。缙云县盘溪公社田寮生产队党支部，不断克服右倾保守思想，立雄心大志，领导群众把“前面山、后面坞，十户人家十户苦”的贫困山村，改变成了“前面山，后面坞，有唱歌，有跳舞，十户人家十户富”的幸福农村。到会代表通过活生生的事实，深刻地体会到加强党的领导是革命事业取得胜利的根本保证，并决心充分发挥党支部的核心领导作用，成为建设社会主义新农村的战斗堡垒。
    会议还总结了标兵党支部的领导方法和思想建设、组织建设方面的经验。支部领导方法的主要经验是，充分发挥党支部的核心领导作用和党员的模范带头作用；坚决依靠群众，密切联系群众，事事坚持群众路线的工作方法，大搞群众运动；坚持党的民主集中制原则，建立集体领导和分工负责相结合的领导制度；加强党支部对共青团、妇女、民兵等组织的领导，充分发挥这些组织的作用。在思想建设和组织建设方面，主要是严格党的组织生活，健全党课教育制度，督促党员学习文化和技术，并经常开展批评与自我批评，以不断提高党员的政治思想水平和文化水平，增强党的团结；同时，要认真培养积极分子，本着积极慎重的方针发展新党员，做好预备党员的教育、考查、转正工作，不断壮大党的队伍。如绍兴县富盛公社富盛生产队党支部密切联系和依靠群众，他们有困难找群众，技术研究找老农，有风浪找贫农，并经常登门拜访和开诸葛亮会。又如永嘉县永临公社将山生产队六年如一日地坚持党的生活制度，通过检查工作开展批评与自我批评，不断提高党员的生活水平。有的党支部开办了夜党校，坚持党课制度，有的开办了政治文化技术三结合的业余学校，来提高党员和群众的政治思想水平和文化技术水平。这些经验教育了到会的每一个党支部书记，对提高他们的领导能力起了显著的作用。
    会议使到会代表进一步解放了思想，开阔了眼界，更加坚定了继续实现跃进的信心和决心。他们体会到，要贯彻党的总路线，就必须经常注意克服右倾保守思想和自满情绪。有些代表原来认为自己领导的生产队是最先进的，这次通过先进比先进，标兵比标兵，亲眼看到了别的支部的长处，表示要鼓足更大干劲，急起直追，争取更大跃进。他们说：过去不看不信，看不到听不进，现在越看越有劲。”如嘉兴平原地区部分党支部代表，过去认为山区不如平原，可是到临安县亭子公社朱村生产队一看，这个解放前的贫困山村，由于党支部坚决贯彻党的总路线，发动社员奋发图强改变穷山村面貌，今年水稻亩产量达到了一千三百多斤，全队平均每亩地养有两头猪。他们赶上有的还超过了平原地区。许多代表当场表示要向朱村党支部学习。又如建德县新安江公社焦山生产队党支部书记储寿明，原来认为自己的生产队是全县的标兵，已经差不多了，可是一看到桐庐县新登公社万市生产队一百多万株桑树上山，桐庐县印渚公社印渚生产队大搞春花丰产畈和培养草子的情况，就说：“越看心越急，越看越感到自己生产队差得远。”
    各地区标兵生产队党支部的倡议书提出以后，一个农村党支部相互间的“学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的群众性竞赛运动，立即在全省范围内轰轰烈烈地开展起来。
