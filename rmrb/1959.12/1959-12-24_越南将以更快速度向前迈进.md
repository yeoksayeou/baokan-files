　　Vietnam Will Move Forward at a Faster Pace
　　Condemns US Imperialism for Seriously Threatening World Peace
　　North Vietnam achieves unprecedented grain harvest this year; total agricultural output value increases by 10 percent compared to last year; total industrial and handicraft output value increases by 30 percent. Currently, farmer households joining cooperatives account for 44 percent of the total, and 45 percent of capitalist industrial and commercial households have realized joint state-private ownership.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: The 11th session of the Vietnamese National Assembly heard Premier Pham Van Dong's report on the work of the government at today's plenary meeting.

The meeting also heard Justice Minister Vu Dinh Hoe's report on the Family and Marriage Law. He pointed out that North Vietnam has already completed the national and democratic revolution in the political and economic fields. Therefore, the old family and marriage system has lost its basis for existence. At present, it is necessary to establish a family and marriage system that conforms to socialist moral standards. He said that the four principles of the new Family and Marriage Law are: freedom of marriage, monogamy; equality between men and women, protection of women's interests in the family, and protection of children's interests.

Deputy Minister of Interior of Vietnam, Su Guangdou, gave a report at the meeting on the National Assembly Election Law. He said that the draft election law stipulates the principle of universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot. Regardless of gender, ethnicity, religious belief, educational level, occupation, temporary residence, or long-term residence, all citizens over the age of eighteen have the right to vote, and citizens over the age of twenty-one have the right to be elected. Only those who are mentally disturbed or have been deprived of their civil rights by a court do not have the right to vote or be elected. He also explained the number of National Assembly representatives, electoral districts, and relevant election system regulations.

At the beginning of today's meeting, Chairman Ton Duc Thang read a congratulatory message from the National Assembly praising the great achievements of the Vietnamese People's Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out in his government work report at the 11th session of the Vietnamese National Assembly today that 1959 was a year of great victories on the economic front in North Vietnam.

He pointed out that in this year, the total grain output in North Vietnam reached 5.2 million tons, an increase of more than 600,000 tons compared with 1958, which had the highest grain output in North Vietnamese history. The total agricultural output value increased by 10% compared with 1958. The total industrial and handicraft output value increased by 30% compared with last year. Among them, state-owned industry increased by 51% compared with last year, and handicraft and private industry and commerce increased by 18%. Socialist industry has grown rapidly. The output value of state-owned industry and joint state-private industry accounts for 80% of the total industrial output value. Local industry has also developed greatly. As of the end of October, more than 500 local industrial units have been established in various provinces of North Vietnam, and their total output value accounts for 10% of this year's total industrial output value.

The report said that as of now, North Vietnam has established more than 28,000 agricultural cooperatives, and farmer households joining cooperatives account for 44% of the total farmer households. Two hundred thousand handicraftsmen have joined various handicraft cooperative organizations, accounting for 60% of the total number of handicraftsmen. 45% of capitalist industrial and commercial households have realized joint state-private ownership. 12% of small vendors have participated in cooperative organizations.

He said that this year, North Vietnam's basic construction investment has doubled compared with last year.

The report said that this year, people's purchasing power has greatly improved, domestic material supplies are normal, and prices are very stable. Socialist commerce has grown greatly, with state-owned retail sales accounting for 62.5% of the total retail sales of the entire market, compared to 55% in 1958.

The report pointed out that this year's fiscal revenue and expenditure are balanced, and domestic fiscal revenue has increased by 39.4% compared with last year.

The report pointed out that in terms of education, two more universities have been added this year, and the number of university students has increased by 4,200. In addition, preparations are being made to send 1,000 students to fraternal countries. The number of secondary vocational schools has increased from 15 last year with 8,300 students to 38 schools with 18,300 students. This year, the number of junior high school students reached 178,971, an increase of 52% compared with 1958.

Premier Pham Van Dong, after reviewing the great achievements of socialist construction and socialist transformation in North Vietnam since the restoration of peace five years ago, said, "All the people of our country from north to south can be proud of these great achievements and progress." He pointed out that the achievement of these results is inseparable from the assistance of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.

Premier Pham Van Dong emphasized: "The key to past and future victories lies in the correctness of the Party's line and the unleashing of the working people's creative labor enthusiasm."

When Premier Pham Van Dong spoke about the tasks for 1960, he pointed out, "Based on the tasks of the Three-Year Plan and on the achievements made this year, we must vigorously promote the development of the current revolution, promote the work in all aspects steadily at a faster pace, resolutely strive to achieve greater victories in 1960, and prepare for the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan."

When Premier Pham Van Dong spoke about the international situation and the diplomatic policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, he said that 1959 was the first year of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and also the year when the People's Republic of China celebrated the great achievements of socialist construction over the past ten years. He talked about the great achievements made by socialist countries in the past year and the movements for national liberation and consolidation of independence in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. At the same time, he pointed out that imperialists, especially US imperialists, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, oppose national liberation movements, create divisions and hatred among countries, and establish military bases in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, thereby posing constant and serious threats to the security of these regional countries and world peace.

Pham Van Dong said that in the current international situation, the firm and unwavering diplomatic policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to continuously strengthen solidarity, ideological unity, and mutual assistance with fraternal socialist countries in accordance with proletarian internationalism, and to strengthen and develop friendly relations with nationalist countries, especially nationalist countries in Asia and Africa; and on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence, to be prepared to establish relations with all countries in all aspects. He pointed out that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam deeply sympathizes with and fully supports the just struggle of all nations against aggressive imperialists and to defend their inviolable interests, and contributes its strength to defending peace and strengthening friendship among nations.

When Pham Van Dong spoke about the relationship between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and its closest neighboring countries, he said that as far as the Kingdom of Cambodia is concerned, the friendly relations between the two countries have withstood the test and are developing forward.

He said that as far as the Kingdom of Laos is concerned, the relations between the two countries appear abnormal. This is due to the US imperialists' aggressive policy in Laos, due to the US imperialists' conspiracy to turn Laos into a US military base, which seriously and directly threatens the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and destroys the 1954 Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements on Laos. As a neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos and a party to the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam certainly has the right to express its attitude on this issue.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly stated that in order to correctly solve the current Laos issue, it is necessary to stop all US imperialist interference in Laos; strictly implement the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements; it is necessary to restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos; no other organizations, including the United Nations, have the right to interfere in Laos; or reconvene the meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference, with the participation of representatives of the International Commission, to seek measures to promote the normalization of the situation in Laos. Pham Van Dong said that for the sake of the friendship between the two peoples and for the interests of peace in Southeast Asia and the world, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely adopts a peaceful and friendly policy towards the Kingdom of Laos. The Vietnamese people hope that the fraternal Laotian people will unite and build a peaceful and prosperous Laos.

In his report, Pham Van Dong expressed his opposition to the so-called war reparations agreement signed between the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government and the South Vietnamese authorities. He pointed out that this "agreement" is illegal and invalid.

Premier Pham Van Dong expressed his firm support for the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament and a series of other proposals. He said that the most urgent and practical suggestion at present is to convene a summit meeting to further ease the international situation and consolidate world peace.

    新华社河内23日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同今天在越南国会第十一次会议上作政府工作报告时指出，1959年是越南北方在经济战线上取得巨大胜利的一年。
    他指出，在这一年里，越南北方谷子总产量达到五百二十万吨，比北越历史上谷子产量最高的1958年增长了六十多万吨，农业总产值比1958年增长了10％。工业和手工业总产值比去年增长了30％。其中，国营工业比去年增长51％，手工业和私营工商业增长18％。社会主义工业迅速壮大了。国营工业和公私合营工业的产值共占工业总产值的80％。地方工业也有很大的发展。截至10月底，北越各省已建立了五百多个地方工业单位，总产值占今年工业总产值的10％。
    报告说，截至目前为止，越南北方已经建立了二万八千多个农业合作社，入社农户占总农户的44％。有二十万名手工业者加入了各种手工业合作组织，占手工业者总数的60％。有45％的资本主义工商业户实现了公私合营。有12％的小商贩参加了合作组织。
    他说，今年北越的基本建设投资比去年增加一倍。
    报告说，今年人民的购买力有很大的提高，国内的物资供应正常，物价非常稳定。社会主义商业有了很大的增长，其中国营零售总额占整个市场的零售总额的62.5％，而1958年是55％。
    报告指出，今年的财政收支平衡，国内财政收入比去年增加39.4％。
    报告指出，在教育方面，今年增设了两所大学，大学生人数增加了四千二百人。此外还正在准备向兄弟国家派遣一千名留学生。中等专业学校从去年的十五所和拥有八千三百名学生增加到三十八所和拥有一万八千三百名学生。今年，初中学生人数达到十七万八千九百七十一人，比1958年增加了52％。
    范文同总理在回顾了和平恢复五年以来越南北方社会主义建设和社会主义改造的巨大成就之后说，
  “我国从北到南的全体人民可以为这些巨大成就和进步感到自豪”。他指出，取得这些成绩是同以苏联为首的社会主义各国的援助分不开的。
    范文同总理强调说：“过去和今后的胜利的关键，在于党的路线的正确和发挥劳动人民创造性的劳动热情。”
    范文同总理谈到1960年的任务时指出，“根据三年计划的任务，在今年所取得的成就的基础上，我们必须大力促进目前正在进行的革命的发展，以更快的速度推动各方面的工作稳健地前进，坚决争取在1960年取得更大的胜利，并为执行第一个五年计划作好准备。”
    范文同总理在谈到国际局势和越南民主共和国的外交政策时说，1959年是苏联七年计划的头一年，也是中华人民共和国庆祝十年来的社会主义建设的伟大成就的一年。他谈到了社会主义国家一年来所取得的巨大成就以及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放和巩固独立的运动。他同时指出，帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者，干涉他国内政，反对民族解放运动，在各国间制造分裂和仇恨，在东南亚和中近东地区建立军事基地，从而对于这些地区国家的安全和世界和平造成经常和严重的威胁。
    范文同说，在目前国际形势下，越南民主共和国坚定不移的外交政策是，根据无产阶级国际主义，同兄弟社会主义国家不断加强团结、思想一致和互相帮助，同民族主义国家特别是亚洲和非洲的民族主义国家，加强和发展友好关系；在和平共处原则的基础上，准备同一切国家在各方面建立关系。他指出，越南民主共和国深切同情和充分支持所有民族反对侵略性的帝国主义者、保卫他们不容侵犯的利益的正义斗争，并且为保卫和平和加强各民族间的友好贡献力量。
    范文同在谈到越南民主共和国同最邻近的国家的关系时说，就柬埔寨王国来说，两国友谊关系已经过了考验。并正在向前发展。
    他说，就老挝王国来说，两国关系显得不正常。这是由于美帝国主义在老挝的侵略政策，由于美帝国主义阴谋把老挝变成美国的军事基地，严重和直接威胁越南民主共和国的安全，破坏了1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议和万象协议。越南民主共和国作为老挝王国的邻国和签订1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议的一方，它当然有权就这个问题表示自己的态度。
    范文同指出，越南民主共和国政府曾经一再声明：要正确解决当前的老挝问题，就必须停止美帝国主义对老挝的一切干涉；严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议；必须恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，其他组织、连联合国在内都无权干涉老挝；或者重新召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议，会议并由国际委员会的代表参加，以寻求促使老挝局势正常化的措施。范文同说，为了两国人民的友谊，为了东南亚和世界和平的利益，越南民主共和国对老挝王国坚决采取和平和友好的政策。越南人民希望兄弟的老挝人民团结起来，建设和平和繁荣的老挝。
    范文同在报告里表示反对日本岸信介政府同南越当局签订的所谓战争赔偿协定。他指出，这个“协定”是不合法的，无效的。
    范文同总理表示坚决支持苏联政府关于全面和彻底裁军的建议和其他一系列建议。他说，当前最迫切和最切实的建议是召开最高级会议，以进一步缓和国际局势，巩固世界和平。
