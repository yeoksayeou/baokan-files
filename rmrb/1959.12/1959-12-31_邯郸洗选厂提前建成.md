Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch: The modern Handan Coal Washing Plant, capable of processing more than 1.5 million tons of raw coal annually, was completed and put into production on the 21st, three months ahead of the designed construction period.

The Handan Coal Washing Plant is built near the famous Fengfeng Coal Mine, which produces prime coking coal. It can provide nearly one million tons of high-quality, low-ash refined coal for the steel industry every year.

This coal washing plant is the first modern large-scale coal washing plant designed by our country itself, and all the machinery and equipment are also manufactured by our own country. The entire production process of the plant, from raw coal entering the plant, coal extraction, transportation and lifting, crushing and washing, to the refined coal leaving the plant, is mechanized and automated. The main machinery and equipment are equipped with automatic controllers, and if mechanical or electrical faults occur, they will automatically stop operating. The plant also has a complete ventilation, dust removal system, and protective devices.

Since construction began in August 1957, the workers of the Handan Coal Washing Plant Engineering Office, who undertook the construction task of this plant, under the leadership of the Party, have continuously opposed right-leaning tendencies and boosted their efforts, overcoming difficulties in raw materials, materials, equipment, and technology, greatly accelerating the construction progress.

　　邯郸洗选厂提前建成
    据新华社天津电　每年能处理一百五十多万吨原煤的现代化洗选厂——邯郸洗选厂，在21日建成投入生产，比设计工期提前三个月竣工。
    邯郸洗选厂建设在产主焦煤著名的峰峰煤矿附近，它每年能为钢铁工业提供近百万吨灰分低的优质精煤。
    这个洗选厂是我国自己设计的第一座现代化大型洗选厂，全部机器设备也都是我国自己制造的。这个厂的全部生产过程，从原煤进厂、取煤、运输提升、破碎和洗选，直到精煤出厂，都是机械化和自动化的。主要机器设备上都装有自动控制器，机械、电气发生故障，就会自动停止运转。厂内还有完善的通风、除尘系统和保护装置。
    这个洗选厂自1957年8月动工兴建以来，承担这座厂建设任务的邯郸洗选厂工程处职工，在党的领导下，不断地反右倾，鼓干劲，克服了原料、材料、设备和技术方面的困难，大大加快了施工进度。
