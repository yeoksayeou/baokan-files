Xinhua News Agency dispatch: This reporter reports: The Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi, while negotiating with the United States to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," has drafted a plan to nuclear-arm Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" and is beginning to implement this plan.

From the terms of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" revealed by the Nobusuke Kishi group, in addition to the "joint operations" of the U.S. and Japanese forces, nuclear armament of Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" will be another central element of this aggressive military treaty aimed at China and the Soviet Union. The new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" not only does not prohibit Japan from nuclear armament, but also stipulates in Article 3 that "both countries must maintain and develop the forces they possess to repel armed attacks." The focus of Japan's Second Military Expansion Plan (1960-1965), drafted by the Nobusuke Kishi group based on this provision, is to nuclear-arm Japan's "Self-Defense Forces." According to Japanese newspapers, this plan will "greatly strengthen the modernization of the Self-Defense Forces' combat capabilities"; "to strengthen the armed forces in quality, not in quantity, which means allowing Japan to possess missiles and other new weapons."

It is worth noting that as the Nobusuke Kishi group accelerates its pace to conclude a new U.S.-Japan military alliance, Nobusuke Kishi himself and his military leaders have openly prepared public opinion and "legal" groundwork to realize this conspiracy. In March of this year, Nobusuke Kishi publicly announced in the Diet that Japan possessing nuclear weapons "does not violate the constitution." At the time, the Director-General of the "Defense Agency," Shiro Inouye, also told the press that it was "a matter of course" for the "Self-Defense Forces" to implement "modernization of equipment."

Recently, the Nobusuke Kishi government has announced that Nobusuke Kishi himself will go to Washington in January next year to sign the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." In this situation, Sohtoku Akagi, the Director-General of the Japanese "Defense Agency," announced at a press conference on November 24 that the drafting of the Second Military Expansion Plan, which will begin in April next year, is nearing completion and will be passed at the "National Defense Council" in January next year. Akagi said that he himself may also go to Washington to discuss this expansion plan with U.S. officials.

On the same day, Akagi also said in the Cabinet Committee of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet that Japan should enhance its missile equipment and produce American "Lockheed" jet aircraft that can be equipped with "Sidewinder" missiles domestically to strengthen the Japanese Air Force.

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said on the 24th that it is almost certain that Nobusuke Kishi will take Japan's new military expansion plan with him when he goes to Washington in January next year to sign the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." It is extremely obvious that the Nobusuke Kishi group, while signing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" with the United States, will finalize this expansion plan with the U.S. authorities, obtain U.S. assistance in nuclear weapons, and implement nuclear armament without restraint.

Japan's new military expansion plan stipulates that Japan will concentrate its efforts on establishing missile forces and producing missiles. According to this plan, Japan will establish two "Nike" missile battalions in 1960 and 1961, and then establish two more "Nike" missile battalions and three "Hawk" missile battalions by 1965. At the same time, the Japanese "Defense Agency" is preparing to set up ten to fifteen missile bases across the country, and also plans to send about 250 "Self-Defense Forces" personnel to the United States in 1960 and 1961 to receive missile training.

In addition, the Japanese Army will be equipped with "Sergeant," "Little John" surface-to-surface missiles, and "Long Javelin," "Cobra" anti-tank missiles, and will gradually be reorganized into five-unit atomic divisions. The Navy will be equipped with destroyers capable of launching missiles. The Air Force will be equipped with "Hawk," "Nike," and "Bomarc" missiles, and will be equipped with 200 Japanese-produced "Lockheed" F-104C jet fighters between 1960 and 1965.

In addition to importing various types of missiles from the United States, Japan will also research and produce missiles themselves. It is announced that Japan's direct military expenditure in 1965 will reach 300 billion yen, of which 30 billion yen will be used for research and trial production of missiles.

Currently, Japan's monopoly military industry such as "Mitsubishi" Konzern, "Fuji" Precision Industries, and Kawasaki Aircraft Industries are already trial-producing various types of missiles.

In fact, Japan has already taken the first step in nuclear armament before officially implementing this new military expansion plan. Recently, the Japanese government, despite the opposition of the Japanese people, secretly transported fourteen "Sidewinder" missiles purchased by the United States into Japan. The Nobusuke Kishi government has also decided to purchase another 180 such missiles in 1959 and 1960. The Japanese "Defense Agency" has also begun to prepare to establish a missile launch site for the "Self-Defense Forces" on Niijima Island in Tokyo Bay.

Japan's nuclear armament is a violation of the Japanese Constitution. This practice of the Nobusuke Kishi group following the U.S. war policy may drag the Japanese people into a nuclear war. The Japanese people, who have suffered from the atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb disasters of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini, resolutely oppose this practice of the Nobusuke Kishi group.

### 岸信介政府拟订庞大核武装计划  勾结美国扩充导弹部队和导弹基地

    岸信介政府拟订庞大核武装计划
    勾结美国扩充导弹部队和导弹基地
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：日本岸信介政府在同美国谈判修改日美“安全条约”的同时，已经拟定了核武装日本“自卫队”的计划，并且着手实施这项计划。
    从岸信介集团透露的新的日美
  “安全条约”的条款看来，除了美国和日本部队的“联合作战”以外，核武装日本“自卫队”将是这项针对中国和苏联的侵略性军事条约的另外一个中心内容。新的日美“安全条约”不仅没有禁止日本核武装，并且在第三条规定：“两国必须保持和发展为打退武装进攻而拥有的力量”。而岸信介集团根据这项条款拟就的日本第二次扩军计划（1960—1965年）的重点就是核武装日本“自卫队”。据日本报纸透露，这个计划要“大大加强自卫队的现代化战斗能力”；“要在质量上，而不是在数量上加强武装部队，这意味着让日本拥有导弹和其它新式武器”。
    值得注意的是，在岸信介集团加紧步调来缔结新的日美军事同盟的同时，岸信介本人和他的军事首脑们已经公然为实现这一阴谋进行舆论和“法律”上的准备，今年3月，岸信介就在国会上公开宣布，日本拥有核武器并“不违反宪法”。当时的“防卫厅”长官伊能繁次郎也向报界说，“自卫队”实行“装备现代化是理所当然的事”。
    最近，岸信介政府已经宣布，岸信介本人将在明年1月到华盛顿签订新的日美“安全条约”。在这种情况下，日本“防卫厅”长官赤城宗德11月24日在记者招待会上宣布，将从明年4月开始的第二次扩军计划的起草工作已经接近完成，并且将在明年1月的“国防会议”上通过。赤城说，他自己也可能到华盛顿去和美国官员讨论这个扩军计划。
    同一天，赤城在日本国会众议院内阁委员会上还说，日本要增强导弹装备的力量，并且要在国内生产美国的可以装备“响尾蛇”式导弹的“洛克希德”式喷气飞机，以加强日本的空军。
    “读卖新闻”在24日说，几乎可以肯定，岸信介在明年1月到华盛顿去签订新的日美“安全条约”的时候，将带着日本的这项新的扩军计划。极其明显，岸信介集团在同美国签订新的日美“安全条约”的同时，将同美国当局最后确定这项扩军计划，并从美国取得核武器的援助，放手实行核武装。
    日本的这项新的扩军计划规定日本将集中力量建立导弹部队和生产导弹。根据这项计划，日本将在1960年和1961年先后建立两营“奈克”导弹部队，并在1965年以前再建立两个营的“奈克”导弹部队和三个营的“鹰式”导弹部队。同时，日本“防卫厅”准备在全国设置十到十五处导弹基地，还计划在1960年和1961年先后派遣约二百五十名“自卫队”队员到美国去接受关于导弹的训练。
    此外，日本的陆军将装备“下士”、“小约翰”式的地地导弹和“长标枪”、“眼镜蛇”等反坦克导弹，并且将逐步改编为五单位制原子师。海军将配备能够发射导弹的驱逐舰。空军将装备“鹰式”、“奈克”和“鲍马克”式等导弹，并将在1960年到1965年期间配备二百架日本生产的“洛克希德”F—104C型喷气式战斗机。
    除了从美国运入各种型式的导弹以外，日本还将自己研究和生产导弹。据宣布，日本在1965年的直接军费将达三千亿日元，其中用于研究和试制导弹的费用将达三百亿日元。
    目前，日本的垄断军火工业如“三菱”康采恩、“富士”精密工业公司、川崎飞机工业公司都已经在试制各种类型的导弹。
    事实上，日本在正式实施这项新的扩军计划以前，已经迈出了核武装的第一步。最近，日本政府不顾日本人民的反对，把由美国购买的十四枚“响尾蛇”式导弹偷偷运进日本。岸信介政府还决定在1959年和1960年再购买一百八十枚这种导弹。日本“防卫厅”也已经动手准备在东京湾的新岛建立“自卫队”的导弹发射场。
    日本进行核武装是违反日本宪法的。岸信介集团追随美国战争政策的这种做法有可能把日本人民拖入一场核战争。遭受过广岛、长崎、比基尼的原子弹、氢弹灾害的日本人民坚决反对岸信介集团的这种做法。
