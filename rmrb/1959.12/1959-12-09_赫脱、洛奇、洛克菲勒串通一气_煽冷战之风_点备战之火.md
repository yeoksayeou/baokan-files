Xinhua News Agency, 7th December, New York dispatch: The American "Worker's Weekly" published an article on the 6th, entitled "Cold War Warriors Gather to Stop Trend Towards Peace."

The article pointed out that Republican leaders in the United States, such as Secretary of State Herter, New York Governor Rockefeller, and Senator Javits, as well as Democrats such as former President Truman and former Secretary of State Acheson, are colluding to undermine the prospect of easing the "Cold War."

The article stated that at the United Nations, US Representative Lodge is doing everything possible to undermine the possibility of cooperation on the fundamental issue of disarmament.

At the Geneva conference of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom on the prohibition of nuclear weapons tests, an agreement had been reached on the research report of scientists from the three countries on how to detect underground hydrogen bomb tests. However, Secretary of State Herter is now threatening to resume hydrogen bomb tests, suggesting that the current decision to suspend hydrogen bomb tests should only be maintained for a few weeks after it expires on December 31.

In the United Nations, the Eisenhower administration is also attempting to create tension and pessimism among the UN representatives to cause trouble. Lodge's submission of the Hungarian internal affairs issue to the United Nations for discussion is an example, and the activities against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the United Nations are of the same nature.

The article said that other cold war propagandists who screamed loudly last week included the so-called "liberal" Republican Javits, who gave a radio address endorsing Rockefeller for president to take a challenging stance against the Soviet Union.

The article pointed out that on the Democratic side, Truman and Acheson and others continue to instigate and intensify the Cold War.

    赫脱、洛奇、洛克菲勒串通一气
    煽冷战之风　点备战之火
    据新华社7日讯　纽约消息：美国“工人周报”6日刊载了一篇文章，题目是“冷战战士纠集起来制止和平趋势”。
    文章指出，美国共和党领导人如国务卿赫脱，纽约州长洛克菲勒和参议员杰维茨以及民主党人如前总统杜鲁门和前国务卿艾奇逊，正在串通一气来破坏“冷战”缓和的前景。
    文章说，在联合国，美国代表洛奇正在千方百计地破坏在裁军这个基本问题上进行合作的可能性。
    在美、苏、英三国关于禁止核武器试验的日内瓦会议上，本来已经就三国科学家关于如何侦查地下氢弹试验的研究报告达成了协议。但是国务卿赫脱现在竟扬言要恢复氢弹试验，建议使目前的停止氢弹试验决定在12月31日期满之后只保持几个星期。
    在联合国里，艾森豪威尔政府也企图以在联合国代表中制造紧张气氛和悲观情绪来进行捣乱。洛奇把匈牙利内政问题提交联合国讨论就是一个例子，在联合国中搞反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的活动，其性质也是一样。
    文章说，在上星期大声嘶叫的其他冷战鼓吹者还有所谓“自由派”的共和党人杰维茨，他发表广播演说，拥护洛克菲勒当总统，来对苏联采取挑战态度。
    文章指出，在民主党方面，杜鲁门和艾奇逊等继续进行煽动来加剧冷战。
