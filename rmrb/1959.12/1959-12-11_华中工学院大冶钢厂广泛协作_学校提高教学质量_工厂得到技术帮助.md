    Huazhong Institute of Technology and Daye Steel Plant Broadly Cooperate
    School Improves Teaching Quality, Factory Receives Technical Assistance

    (Our dispatch) Huazhong Institute of Technology conscientiously implements the Party's education policy, and is conducting comprehensive cooperation with Daye Steel Plant in a planned way, which not only strongly supports industrial production, but also enriches and improves the quality of teaching.

    The comprehensive cooperation between Huazhong Institute of Technology and Daye Steel Plant is being carried out to meet the teaching requirements of multi-disciplinary higher industrial schools and the production development of factories. This spring, Daye Steel Plant collected technical problems existing in various aspects of production, combined with the requirements of long-term development, and put forward some scientific and technological problems, hoping to get help from higher industrial schools. Huazhong Institute of Technology, as a multi-disciplinary higher industrial school, also urgently needs to conduct comprehensive cooperation with integrated factories and enterprises to improve the quality of teaching and scientific research through cooperation. Therefore, a cooperative relationship was quickly established.

    The scope of cooperation between the two units is very wide, including scientific research, technical information exchange, on-site teaching, production internships, training of technical cadres, and mutual use of laboratories. Teachers and students from eleven majors of the school participated in various scientific research projects, with an average of forty teachers and students working and laboring in the factory every month; the steel plant also regularly has a certain number of workers and technicians studying and training at the Institute of Technology. After the teachers and students went to the factory, under the leadership of the Party committee, they truly achieved close integration of teachers, students, and workers. They often labor together with workers, go deep into the field to collect data, and study production problems with workers. At the same time, they also conduct on-site teaching, which can not only solve practical problems, but also conduct theoretical analysis.

    After several months of practice, one of the major gains of this cooperation is the strong support for factory production. The industrial thermal engineering major, based on the problem raised by the steel plant of how to improve the gasification intensity and calorific value of the gas generator, conducted research and experiments with workers and technicians, so that the original situation where two gas furnaces were needed to supply one open hearth furnace was changed to using one gas furnace. This saved the factory raw coal, equipment, and manpower. The metallography major worked closely with the factory to conduct research on alloy steel using manganese and nitrogen instead of nickel, and carried out a series of experiments such as smelting, forging, metallographic heat treatment, and corrosion, and has achieved preliminary results. The solution of this problem will not only add new products of high-quality steel to Daye Steel Plant, but also open up prospects for my country to use manganese and nitrogen instead of nickel. The gas research group and the open hearth thermal engineering research group, under the guidance of workers and technicians, greatly shortened the steelmaking time, broke the smelting record three times, and increased the life of the converter lining from the original ten or so heats after each repair to more than forty heats.

    Another important gain of factory-school cooperation is the significant improvement in teaching quality. Graduates of the industrial thermal energy major used to have to go through at least one year of internship before they could handle technical problems; now, third-year students can not only perform general operations of gas generators, but also, under the guidance and help of teachers, technicians, and workers, solve some technical problems. Many students have consolidated their basic course learning in production technology research and production labor, so that the learning effect of many courses has exceeded the requirements of the teaching syllabus. Teachers have also enriched the content of teaching materials through production practice, so that some experiments that could not be carried out in the past can now be carried out, and the effect is very good.

    华中工学院大冶钢厂广泛协作
    学校提高教学质量　工厂得到技术帮助
    本报讯　华中工学院认真贯彻党的教育方针，有计划地与大冶钢厂进行全面协作，既有力地支援了工业生产，又丰富和提高了教学质量。
    华中工学院与大冶钢厂的全面协作，是适应着多科性高等工业学校的教学要求和工厂的生产发展而开展起来的。今年春天，大冶钢厂汇集了生产上各方面存在的技术问题，结合长远发展的要求，提出了一些科学技术问题，希望得到高等工业学校的帮助。而华中工学院是多科性的高等工业学校，也迫切需要和联合性工厂企业进行全面协作，从协作中来提高教学、科学研究的质量。因此，协作关系很快地建立起来了。
    两个单位协作的范围是十分广泛的，其中包括科学研究、技术资料交流、现场教学、生产实习、培养技术干部、互相使用实验室等等。学校有十一个专业的师生参加了各项科学研究工作，平均每月有四十位师生在厂里劳动和工作；钢厂也经常有一定数量的工人、技术人员在工学院进修和培训。师生在下厂以后，在党委领导下，真正作到了教师、学生和工人紧密结合。他们经常和工人一起劳动，深入现场收集资料，与工人一起研究生产中的问题，同时也结合进行现场教学，既能解决实际问题，又能进行理论分析。
    经过几个月的实践，这种协作的重大收获之一，是有力地支援了工厂生产。工业热工学专业根据钢厂提出的如何提高煤气发生炉的气化强度和发热量的问题，和工人、技术人员一起进行了研究和试验，使原来需二台煤气炉才能供应上一座平炉生产的情况改用一台煤气炉就足够了。为工厂节省了原煤、设备和人力。金相专业与厂方紧密协作，进行以锰氮代镍的合金钢研究，作了熔炼、锻压、金相热处理及腐蚀等一系列试验，已获得了初步成果。这个问题的解决，不仅将为大冶钢厂增加优质钢的新产品，而且为我国以锰氮代镍开拓了前途。煤气研究小组和平炉热工研究小组，在工人、技术人员指导下，使炼钢时间大大缩短，三次大破熔炼纪录，而且使转炉炉衬寿命由原来修理一次只能炼十多炉，提高到四十多炉。
    厂校协作的另一重要收获，是教学质量显著提高。工业热能专业毕业生过去至少要经过一年实习，才能动手处理技术问题；现在三年级学生不仅已经可以作煤气发生炉的一般操作，而且在教师、技术人员、工人的指导和帮助下，已能解决一些技术问题。许多学生在生产技术研究工作和生产劳动中，巩固了基础课的学习，使不少课程的学习效果，超过了教学大纲的要求。教师们也通过生产实践，丰富了教材的内容，使一些过去无法开出的实验，已能开出，而且效果很好。
