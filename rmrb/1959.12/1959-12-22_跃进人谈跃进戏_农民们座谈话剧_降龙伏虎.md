Leaping Forward People Talk About Leaping Forward Opera
    ——Farmers Discuss the Drama "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger"

"Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger" is an excellent play performed by the China Youth Art Theatre to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. It vividly praises the soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom of the broad masses of farmers during the Great Leap Forward. It truthfully portrays their heroic spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and transforming the world, as well as their communist spirit of selflessness and collaboration. At the same time, this play also criticizes right-leaning ideas that belittle the strength of the masses and are passively conservative. After the performance of "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger," it was welcomed by the broad masses of the audience. On the afternoon of December 18th, the Youth Art Theatre invited farmers from the suburbs of Beijing to watch the play and held a discussion. The following is a record of some of the speeches at the discussion. – Editor

　　Song Ruizhen (Zhongde People's Commune):
    After watching the play, not only I myself, but everyone with me said that the things in the play are just like what happened in our commune. The events in the play and the actions of the characters reflect the scene in our rural areas during the Great Leap Forward. When I was watching the play, it felt like I was working with them. I have the following points to share:

    First of all, the Great Leap Forward led by the Party is correct. We can only complete our work tasks by relying on the masses and following the mass line. This can be seen from Secretary Xing's work in the play; he is very calm and not flustered. Although the work tasks are urgent, he goes to the masses to discuss when he encounters difficulties, so he can successfully complete the tasks.

    Secondly, the masses have plenty of enthusiasm during the Great Leap Forward. People are not afraid of any difficulties and resolutely fight against superstition and conservative thinking.

    I am in charge of women's work. The women in our commune also participated in the construction of the reservoir, working as hard as the men. The women in the play are also very enthusiastic, and the construction site director, Li Yutao, made me think about the issue of gender equality. Gender equality should be reflected in labor. Women in rural areas can truly play a greater role after communization.

    In addition, I think the characters in the play are written very profoundly. In order to build the bridge and transport ore down the mountain, the work sparked a struggle between advanced and backward thinking, reflected in various aspects: struggles between husband and wife, struggles between father and son, and also struggles between old friends. In particular, the intense ideological struggle between the two old men was truly moving. In the end, the old man with conservative ideas also liberated his thinking and joined the bridge-building work.

　　Zhou Jun (Zhongde People's Commune):
    This play is very educational, and the plot is so intense that it brought tears to my eyes. Especially the scene where Zhao Daddie and Qin Erbo fought, my heart followed their struggle up and down until Qin Erbo, with the help and enlightenment of Secretary Xing, persuaded Zhao Daddie to pole the boat. Only then did I calm down!

    Secretary Xing is a hard-working and simple person. His work attitude is very stable and not impatient. What he says is always accurate, like understanding Engineer Yin's thoughts. It's like looking into his heart and helping him with the right medicine.

    The plot is very consistent with the situation of soaring enthusiasm in rural areas. Like Captain Fuhu, Zhao Dakang, and Captain Jianglong, Jin Delong, they were "competing" in their work and had great enthusiasm, which well demonstrated the character of young farmers. After I go back, I must better mobilize the masses, and the young people must learn from the characters in the play.

    This play is very well performed. It would be best if it could be made into a movie so that the vast number of members in rural areas can see such a good play.

　　Gao Yi (Fengtai Farm):
    This drama truly reflects the ideological situation in the rural Great Leap Forward. In socialist construction, there are many people with soaring enthusiasm in rural areas, but there are still a few people like Zhao Daddie and Engineer Yin in the play who have conservative ideas. Zhao Daddie and Qin Erbo in the play taught me a lot. Although they have more than fifty years of friendship, for the benefit of future generations, they did not hesitate to break their old friendship and fought to such an extent. Old people are different from young people, but Qin Erbo's struggle was very resolute. In addition, the struggle between father and son in this play is also very intense; young people dare to think and dare to act. Zhao Daddie said that there was a dragon's eye under the Luban stone, but Zhao Dakang threw it away for the benefit of the masses.

    Secretary Xing's leadership work is indeed a combination of struggle and unity. He mobilized all positive factors and enabled everyone to play a role, proving the greatness of the Party's general line and its successful implementation in rural areas. This time when I go back, I will study the spirit of the people in the play and work with soaring enthusiasm.

　　Wu Yuqin (Pingfang Station, Zhongde People's Commune):
    Watching this play really pointed out a direction for my work. As a leading cadre and Party member, I often have concerns in my thinking, and I am not willing to offend people. My struggle is not strong. The ideological struggle between the two old men in the play was particularly enlightening to me. When the old man Zhao said he would not pole the boat, I was so anxious that I really wanted to grab him and force him to go. But Secretary Xing's work is so meticulous. He has been patiently helping him to change his mind. So everyone said when watching the play, "This scene is great!"

    After I go back, I will definitely keep thinking about the plot today. When I encounter difficulties, I will take the people in the play as my teachers.

　　Wang Yu (Jinzhan Station, Zhongde People's Commune):
    "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger" is such a good play. After watching it, it is indeed like attending a profound political class. We also have youth commando teams in our unit. Their enthusiasm is like the enthusiasm of the young people in the play. They really dare to think and dare to act, and they try their best to overcome difficulties and complete tasks. Take myself as an example. I am also a leading cadre, and I have some conservative ideas. From the play, I saw that as long as you listen to the Party, have confidence, and believe in the masses, you will be able to complete all tasks. After watching the play, it was like taking a bath and adding a bar of soap, which washed away my own conservative thoughts very well and really cleared my mind. In the future, I must work hard, learn from the advanced people in the play, and further boost my enthusiasm to do a good job.

　　Hao Ping (Dayangbao Station, Heping People's Commune):
    The idea of the play is very profound and has great educational significance. Secretary Xing's work characteristic is that he can understand the situation, grasp the thoughts, and do the ideological work of the cadres very carefully, such as the education and help for Engineer Yin, which is truly a combination of unity and struggle.

    The scene of grabbing the list was very well performed. The soaring enthusiasm of the young people was all demonstrated. Zhao Dakang and Jin Delong were vying to grab the list in order to build the bridge piers, which showed their communist spirit. This can play a great educational role for young people.

　　Ren Guixiang (Heping People's Commune):
    This play shows the spirit of daring to think and daring to act in the Great Leap Forward, which has also transformed engineers with middle-of-the-road thinking.

    I am the person who likes to watch drama the least, but this time I really liked it. The plot of this play is very good and has a lot of ideological content. Drama is truly the best form to reflect rural life in a timely manner. I hope you can write more good plays like "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger" in the future so that more farmers can see them.

　　Guo Songcai (Zhongde People's Commune):
    This play is so good. I really want to write a few big-character posters on the spot to praise and thank the comrades in the theater.

    After watching the play, I felt extremely happy and felt that this would be a great education for people with right-leaning conservative ideas.

    From this play, we can also see that the literary and art workers have brought into play the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and the play is performed so well and so vividly! We really have to thank you. You revised it dozens of times in order to perform the play well. This kind of serious work spirit is really worth learning. Watching this play is like listening to a vivid report and attending an ideological education class.

　　跃进人谈跃进戏
    ——农民们座谈话剧“降龙伏虎”
    “降龙伏虎”是中国青年艺术剧院为庆祝建国十周年而演出的优秀剧目，它生动地歌颂了大跃进中广大农民群众的冲天干劲和无穷的智慧，真实地表现了他们那种敢想敢干、翻天复地的英雄气概，以及舍己为人的共产主义协作的精神面貌；同时，这个戏对那些轻视群众力量、消极保守的右倾思想，也作了批判。“降龙伏虎”演出以后，受到了广大观众的欢迎。12月18日下午，青年艺术剧院邀请了北京郊区的农民看了这个戏，并举行了座谈。下面是座谈会上一部分发言的记录。　——编者
　　宋瑞珍（中德人民公社）：
    看了戏，不但是我自己，我们一起的人都这样说，这个戏里的事情就像出在我们的公社一样。戏里的事和人物的行动都反映了大跃进中我们农村的景象。我在看戏的时候，也像和他们在一起干着似的。我有这么几点体会：
    首先是党领导的大跃进是正确的。我们只有依靠群众，走群众路线，才能完成工作任务。这从戏里面邢书记的工作就可以看出来；他很从容、不忙乱，工作任务虽然紧急，但是他遇到了困难就去找群众商量，因此能够顺利地完成任务。
    其次是大跃进中群众的干劲是非常足的，人们不怕一切困难，向迷信和保守思想作坚决的斗争。
    我是搞妇女工作的。我们社的妇女也参加修水库，和男同志一样地劳动。戏里的妇女干劲也很大，那个工地主任李玉桃使我想到了男女平等的问题。男女平等正是应该表现在劳动上。农村中的妇女在公社化以后，才真正能发挥更大的作用。
    另外，我认为戏里的几个人物写的很深刻。戏里为了造桥运矿石下山，在工作中就引起了先进思想和落后思想的斗争，表现在各方面：有夫妇之间的斗争，有父子之间的斗争，也有老交情之间的斗争，特别是两个老人的一场激烈的思想斗争，真是感动人。最后，有保守思想的老人也解放了思想，参加了修桥工作。
　　周俊（中德人民公社）：
    这个戏的教育意义很大，剧情也很紧张，把我激动得流出了眼泪。特别是赵大爹和秦二伯斗争的那一场戏，真使我的心跟着他们的斗争忽上忽下，直到秦二伯在邢书记的启发帮助下，说服了赵大爹去撑船，我才把心撩下来！
    邢书记是一个艰苦朴素的人，他的工作态度很稳，不急躁。讲出来的话句句都很准，像对尹工程师的思想了解，那真和钻到他的心里去看了一样，能对症下药地帮助他。
    从剧中的情节来讲是很符合农村的冲天干劲的情况的。像伏虎队长赵大康，和降龙队长金德隆，在工作上就算“叫上劲”了，干劲真大，很好地表现了青年农民的性格。我回去后，一定要更好地发动群众，要青年们一定得向剧中的人物学习。
    这个剧演的非常好，最好能拍成电影，让农村广大的社员都能看到这样的好戏。
　　高义（丰台农场）：
    这个话剧真是把农村大跃进中的思想情况真实地反映出来了。在社会主义建设中，农村中有很多干劲冲天的人，但也还有少数人像戏里的赵大爹、尹工程师等那样有保守思想。戏里的赵大爹和秦二伯对我的教育很大。他们之间虽有五十多年的老交情，但是为了子孙后代的利益，也不惜掰了老交情，斗争到那样的地步。老年人不同于青年人，可是秦二伯斗争性很坚决。另外，这个戏里父子之间的斗争也很激烈；青年人就是敢想敢干，赵大爹说鲁班石底下是龙眼，赵大康为了群众的利益，还是把它抛掉了。
    邢书记的领导工作确是有斗争有团结，他调动了一切积极因素，使所有的人都发挥了作用，证明了党的总路线的伟大和在农村贯彻的胜利。我这次回去，要好好地学习剧中人的精神，以冲天的干劲去工作。
　　吴玉琴（中德人民公社平房站）：
    看了这个戏真是在工作上给指出了一个方向。作为一个领导干部和党员，我自己在思想上也是常有顾虑，打不开情面，斗争性不强；像剧中两个老头的思想斗争对我的思想启发特别大，当老赵头说不去撑船时，把我急得真想一把把他抓过来，硬叫他去。可是邢书记的工作多细致呀，一直是耐心地帮助他转变过来。所以大家在看戏时都说：“这场戏真棒！”
    我回去后，一定常想到今天的剧情，遇到困难要以剧中人当老师。
　　王玉（中德人民公社金盏站）：
    “降龙伏虎”这出戏演的太好了，我看了以后的确是像上了一堂深刻的政治课。我们单位也有青年突击队，他们的干劲就像戏里面的青年们的干劲一样，真是敢想敢干，想尽一切办法来突破困难，完成任务。拿我自己来说，也是个领导干部，就有一些保守思想。从戏里面我看到，只要听党的话，有信心，相信群众，就会完成一切任务。看了戏以后真像洗澡加了一把肥皂，把我本身的保守思想给很好地洗了一洗，把脑筋确实洗清楚了。今后我一定要好好地工作，向剧中的先进人物学习，更加鼓足干劲，搞好工作。
　　郝平（和平人民公社大阳宝站）：
    戏的思想很深刻，教育意义很大。邢书记的工作特点是能够了解情况，掌握思想，把干部的思想工作做得很细致，像对尹工程师的教育和帮助，真是既有团结又有斗争。
    抢榜的一场戏演的很好，青年人的冲天干劲都表现出来了，赵大康、金德隆为了修桥墩都是争先恐后地去抢榜，表现了他们的共产主义精神，这对青年人特别能起很大的教育作用。
　　任贵祥（和平人民公社）：
    这个戏表现了大跃进中人们敢想敢干的精神，使有中游思想的工程师也转变了。
    我是一个最不爱看话剧的人，这次看了真是喜欢。这出戏的剧情很好，很有思想内容。话剧真是及时反映农村生活的最好的形式。希望你们今后能编出更多像“降龙伏虎”这样的好戏来，使更多的农民都能看到。
　　郭松才（中德人民公社）：
    这出戏太好了，我真想当场写几张大字报来表扬和感谢剧院的同志。
    我看了戏，心里痛快极了，觉得这对有右倾保守思想的人会是很大的教育。
    从这出戏也看出文艺工作者发挥了敢想敢干的精神，把戏演的这么好，这么生动！我们真得感谢你们。你们为了把戏演好，修改了几十次，这种认真的工作精神真值得学习。看这场戏好比听了一次生动的报告，上了一堂思想教育课。
