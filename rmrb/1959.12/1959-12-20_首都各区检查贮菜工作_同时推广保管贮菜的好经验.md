Capital Districts Inspect Vegetable Storage Work, Simultaneously Promoting Good Experiences in Vegetable Preservation

(Our dispatch) Recently, districts in the suburbs of Beijing formed special groups to inspect the cabbage preservation situation in more than 3,600 units and households, including government offices, factories, mines, schools, military units, and people's communes, and provided guidance on storage methods.

At present, the storage and preservation work of the vast majority of units is very good. For example, the Beijing Railway Cadre School, which stores more than 360,000 jin of vegetables, has leadership who attach great importance to it and has dedicated personnel responsible. They regularly turn over the stored vegetables and pickle and dry more than 23,000 jin of fallen cabbage stalks and leaves into pickles and dried vegetables, thus minimizing losses. Because street residents store fewer vegetables and preserve them well, there are also few instances of rotten vegetables. However, some units, due to the lack of dedicated personnel responsible and infrequent turnover, have experienced vegetable spoilage. For example, the ventilation in the Beijing Electric Power College's vegetable cellar was poor, and about 90,000 jin of vegetables were red-headed and rotten.

During the inspection process, the inspection teams held on-site meetings at any time to promote good experiences in cabbage storage. For units with poor preservation work, in addition to urging them to pay attention to it and mobilizing the masses to do a good job in preservation, they also provided technical guidance separately.

The inspection also found that some units did not pay enough attention to saving vegetables. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee requires all units to pay attention to saving so that the stored Chinese cabbage can be eaten until the new vegetables are on the market next spring.

    计划吃菜　细心保管
    首都各区检查贮菜工作
    同时推广保管贮菜的好经验
    本报讯  北京城郊各区，最近组成专门小组，到三千六百多个机关、厂矿、学校、部队、人民公社等单位和住户检查了白菜的保管情况，同时就贮藏方法进行指导。
    目前，绝大多数单位的贮藏、保管工作很好。例如存菜三十六万多斤的北京铁道干部学校，由于领导重视，有专人负责，做到经常翻倒存菜，同时把掉下来的二万三千多斤菜帮、菜叶腌制晾晒成咸菜和干菜，因此很少损失。街道居民由于存菜少，保管好，烂菜现象也很少。但也有少数单位由于没有专人负责，翻倒不勤，发生了腐菜现象。如北京电力学院菜窖通风不好，红头和腐烂的约有九万多斤。
    在检查过程中，各检查小组随时召开了现场会议，推广贮藏白菜的好经验；对于保管工作较差的单位，除督促他们重视、发动群众搞好保管外，并分别给予技术指导。
    检查中还发现有些单位对节约吃菜注意不够。北京市人民委员会要求各单位注意节约，让贮存的大白菜能吃到明年春天新菜上市的时候。
