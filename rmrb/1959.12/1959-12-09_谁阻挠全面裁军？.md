    Who is Obstructing Complete Disarmament?
    Editor's Note: The American Communist "Worker's Weekly" published an article by Mason on November 15 entitled "Who is Obstructing Complete Disarmament?" Excerpts are translated below:

    Fortunately for us, the current demand for disarmament has captured the imagination of people everywhere and given them hope.

    But the path to disarmament will not be smooth, especially in our own country, where many who profit from the manufacture of weapons and war are powerful enough to erect numerous obstacles. First and foremost are some of the giant monopolies in industry. War and weapons production have always been the fat meat that has fed them.

    In 1942 (the second year of America's participation in the war, the fourth year after the outbreak of the war) there were 205 manufacturing companies, each with assets of $50 million or more. In 1934, these monopolies owned 37% of the manufacturing companies in the United States. By 1942, the percentage of companies they owned had jumped to 49%.

    How these financial giants used the war to increase their ownership and control of manufacturing facilities can also be seen from the employment situation.

    By 1944, companies that employed 500 or more workers accounted for only 2% of the nation's manufacturing companies, but they employed 62% of all workers engaged in production. And those truly giant monopolies (each with 10,000 or more workers) increased their share of employed workers from 13% in 1939 to 31% in 1944.

    These monopolies not only used the war effort to boost their profits, they also ensured that their ability to extract these profits in the future was greatly enhanced.

    In 1939, all of the manufacturing equipment in the United States had originally been built for approximately $40 billion. However, during World War II, $26 billion was spent on building new factories, two-thirds of which was paid for by the American people.

    According to government estimates, $20 billion of these wartime-built manufacturing facilities could be used for peacetime production. Therefore, the productivity of American industry increased by 50% in the short six years of World War II, two-thirds of which was paid for by the American people, and all of this fell freely into the hands of the monopolies. And of all this huge industrial equipment, the 250 largest companies grabbed more than two-thirds by the end of World War II—as much as the entire productive capacity of the United States before World War II.

    These 250 largest companies are controlled by five major financial groups. If you want to know why Rockefeller opposes banning nuclear weapons testing and opposes negotiating peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union, the Rockefeller family is one of the five dominant financial groups that profited so much from World War II and weapons production. But these billionaire financial groups are not content to manufacture weapons only during wartime; how could they easily let go of such a lucrative business.

    In 1929, our government spent only $700 million annually on armaments. But during World War II, the federal government incurred a debt of $220 billion to pay these monopolies for the purchase of war materials. Due to this debt, the American people will pay Wall Street double that amount in principal and interest.

    The Rockefeller family, Morgan, and the Mellon family continued the arms race after World War II and invented the Cold War as a stimulus to continue the most profitable weapons production. In 1947, $11.5 billion was spent on armaments; by 1958, we used another $45 billion on weapons to fatten these monopoly capitalists.

### 谁阻挠全面裁军？

专栏：外论摘要

    谁阻挠全面裁军？
    编者按　美共“工人周报”11月15日刊登了梅森的一篇文章，标题是：“谁阻挠全面裁军？”摘译如下：
    对我们说来运气的是，目前关于裁军的要求已经抓住了世界各地人民群众的想像，并使他们抱有了希望。
    但是裁军的道路不会是平坦的，特别是在我们自己的国家里，许多从制造武器和战争中获取利润的人强有力到足以设下重重障碍的。首先就是工业中的一些庞大的垄断组织。战争和武器生产一直是把它们喂大的肥肉。
    1942年（美国参战的第二年，战争爆发以后的第四年）有二百零五家制造公司，每家拥有五千万美元或更多的资产。1934年这些垄断组织拥有美国37％的制造公司。到1942年，他们拥有的公司的百分比就跃到49％。
    这些财政巨头怎样利用战争来增加他们的制造设备的所有权和控制，也可以从就业情况中看出来。
    到1944年，全国雇有五百名或五百名以上工人的公司仅占全国制造公司的2％，但是，它们却雇有全部进行生产的工人的62％。而那些真正庞大的垄断组织（每家有一万名或更多的工人）把它们雇用的工人的份额从1939年的13％增加到1944年的31％。
    这些垄断组织不仅利用战争的努力来使它们的利润激增，它们还要保证它们将来榨取这些利润的能力大大提高。
    在1939年，美国时当所有的制造设备原来是用了大约四百亿美元建造起来的。但是，在第一次世界大战期间，就花了二百六十亿美元来建造新厂，其中有三分之二是美国人民出的钱。
    据政府估计，这些战时建造的制造设备中有二百亿美元可以用于和平时期的生产。因此，美国工业的生产力在第二次世界大战时期短短六年里就增加了50％，其中有三分之二是美国人民出的钱，而这些都白白地落在垄断组织的手里了。而在所有这些巨大的工业设备中，有二百五十家最大的公司到二次大战结束的时候，就霸占了三分之二以上——同第二次世界大战前美国的全部生产能力一样多。
    这二百五十家最大的公司是由五个大财团控制的。如果你希望知道为什么洛克菲勒反对禁止核武器试验，反对同苏联谈判和平共处问题，洛克菲勒家族就是这五个从第二次世界大战和武器生产中获利这样多的占支配地位的财团中的一个。但是这些亿万富翁的财团并不满足于在战时制造武器；这样一笔生意怎能把它轻易放过。
    1929年，我们的政府每年在军备方面只花费七亿美元。但是在第二次世界大战期间，联邦政府为了支付这些垄断组织购买作战物资竟欠下了二千二百亿美元的债务，由于这一笔债款，美国人民连本带利要付给华尔街多一倍的数目。
    洛克菲勒家族、摩根和梅隆家族在第二次世界大战以后，继续开展军备运动，并且发明冷战作为一种刺激，以便继续进行利润最大的武器生产。1947年在军备上花费了一百一十五亿美元；到1958年，我们又在武器上用了四百五十亿美元来养肥这些垄断资本家们。
