Where American Merchants Go, There is Unrest
U.S. to Dump Rice in the Far East
Dooming the Agriculture of Countries Like Cambodia, Thailand, and Burma
    Rangoon Dispatch: According to a report in the Burmese "Reporter" newspaper, the United States recently decided to export 250,000 tons of rice to some Asian countries, including 150,000 tons to India, 75,000 tons to Indonesia, and 10,000 tons each to Pakistan and Ceylon. When the news arrived, the trade and political circles of Burma were quite uneasy. The Burmese "Reporter" said that people accuse the American action of being an economic expansion, the purpose of which is to create economic difficulties in Burma.
    Phnom Penh Dispatch: Cambodian newspapers are very uneasy about the American decision to dump American rice in the Southeast Asian market.
    The "Unified News" published an editorial saying that "the U.S. dumping of rice in the Far East market will doom agricultural countries like Cambodia, Thailand, and Burma."
    The newspaper, in quoting news about American capitalists and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique building large-scale rice mills in Hong Kong, said that although they claim they are prepared to supply famine-stricken Asian countries like India and Pakistan with relief rice, in reality they will dump millions of tons of rice in the Asian market.
    This newspaper and the "Friendship News" also quoted the Burmese "Nation News" as saying that this dumping by the United States will cause an economic crisis in the region.

    美商到哪里　哪里就不安
    美国要在远东倾销大米
    将置柬、泰、缅等国农业于死地
    仰光消息　据缅甸“记者报”报道，美国最近决定向一些亚洲国家输出二十五万吨大米，其中向印度输出十五万吨，向印度尼西亚输出七万五千吨，向巴基斯坦和锡兰各输出一万吨。消息传来，缅甸的贸易界、政界人士颇为不安。缅甸“记者报”说，人们指责美国的行动是一种经济扩张，其目的是要在缅甸制造经济困难。
    金边消息　柬埔寨报纸对美国要在东南亚市场倾销美国大米的决定，感到十分不安。
    “统一报”发表社论说，“美国在远东市场倾销大米，将置柬埔寨、泰国和缅甸等农业国家于死地。”
    这家报纸在引述了关于美国资本家和台湾蒋介石集团正在香港兴建大规模碾米厂的消息时说，虽然他们声言他们准备供给遭受饥荒的印度、巴基斯坦等亚洲国家以救济米，实际上他们将在亚洲市场倾销几百万吨大米。
    这家报纸和“友谊报”还引证缅甸“民族报”的话说，美国的这种倾销将在这个地区造成经济危机。
