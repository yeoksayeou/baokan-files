　　This Year's Flowers, Next Year's Melons
    Beijing Dongfeng Machinery Factory Worker Zhang Baoqing
    On the agricultural front, if we want a good wheat harvest next year, we must plant this year. To prevent drought and flooding, we must dig ditches and canals this year. Look! The great upsurge in agricultural water conservancy has already begun!
    The industrial front must also be like this. Various factories and mining enterprises have completed this year's production tasks ahead of schedule and have also proposed to "start the year with a bang." This means that production on the first working day, the first month, and the first quarter of next year will continue to rise steadily. How can we achieve this? Just like winter wheat, there will be no harvest next year if we don't sow the seeds well this year. In other words, our working class must lay the foundation for next year's "start with a bang" during these days of the fourth quarter. If this "foundation" is well laid, next year's "start with a bang" will be guaranteed. We must let the flowers of technological revolution bloom big, and next year's melons will be big! Next year's new products should be trial-produced as much as possible this year, and next year's production will be a complete success. It seems that the tense battle in the last few days will have a great impact on next year's production. If our working class does not prepare well for the great tide of progress for next year, we will not be able to push forward a greater leap forward on the industrial front next year!

　　今年的花  明年的瓜
    北京东风机械厂工人  张宝清
    在农业战线上，要想使明年的小麦取得丰收，今年就必须种上；为了防止旱涝，今年就必须挖好沟渠。看！农村的水利化大高潮运动早就开始了！
    工业战线上也必须这样，各厂矿企业提前完成了今年的生产任务，并且也提出了明年要“开门红”。就是说明年的第一个工作日、第一个月、第一季度的生产要继续稳步上升。怎样才能作到呢？跟冬小麦一样，今年不下好种明年是不会丰收的，也就是说，我们工人阶级必须在这第四季度的日子里要为明年的“开门红”打下基础。如果这个“基础”打的好，明年的“开门红”就有把握。我们必须让技术革命花开的大，明年的瓜儿就结的大！明年的新产品今年就要尽可能的试制成，明年的生产就能满堂红，看来最后几日紧张的战斗，对明年生产有很大影响。我们工人阶级不为明年准备好推进一切的大浪潮，就不会推起明年工业战线上的更大的跃进！
