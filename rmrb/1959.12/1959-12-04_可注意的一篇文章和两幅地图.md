A Noteworthy Article and Two Maps

Editor's Note: On October 25th, the American newspaper "New York Times" published an article on its fifth page by the famous American military commentator Baldwin, entitled "Bases Extremely Important to American Defense," and also published two maps, occupying eight columns wide and fifty-two lines high. The map titles were: "American Overseas Bases - Important Factors in Military and Foreign Policy Issues." The article and two maps published by the "New York Times" fully expose the fact that the American warmongering forces are stepping up their arms expansion and war preparations under the smoke screen of "peace."

Baldwin's article vigorously advocates the importance of American overseas military bases, especially missile bases, in maintaining America's "deterrent force" and its "position" and "prestige" in the Western Pacific, Asia, and the Atlantic. He openly stated that overseas bases "enable the United States to fight limited wars." This article, except for words like "defense" and "aggression" which should be interpreted in the opposite sense, clearly demonstrates America's strategic intentions, especially emphasizing the strategic significance of maintaining overseas bases before the United States gains an advantage in intercontinental missiles.

The map on the left published by the "New York Times" is labeled as a "World Strategic Map," and the one on the right is labeled as a "Map of the European Situation." The legend explains that: the grid area represents the "Communist Bloc," the black area represents the "Western Defense Area," the pentagram represents "Western Military Bases," the black square represents "Communist Bloc Military Bases," the black missile represents the American missile bases that have been built, and the white missile represents the American missile bases planned to be built. The arc on the left map represents the range of 5,500-mile intercontinental missiles launched from the United States as the center, which includes most of the Soviet Union, Eastern European socialist countries, northern China, Korea, most of Mongolia, Japan, Italy, West Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Greenland, and Canada. The three arcs on the right map represent the range of 1,500-mile intermediate-range missiles launched by the United States from Britain, Italy, and Turkey, all aimed at the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries.

In addition, the "New York Times" also prominently quoted in two columns under the map the resolution passed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Paris in December 1957 regarding the installation of nuclear-tipped missiles in Europe.

Published here is a summary of Baldwin's article and photographs of the two maps from the "New York Times." (Pictures attached)

    可注意的一篇文章和两幅地图
    编者按10月25日，美国“纽约时报”在第五版上发表了美国著名军事评论家鲍德温的一篇题为“对美国防御非常重要的基地”的文章，还发表了两幅共占八栏宽、五十二行高的地图。地图标题是：“美国的海外基地——在军事和外交政策问题上的重要因素”。“纽约时报”刊登的这篇文章和两幅地图，充分暴露了美国好战势力正在“和平”烟幕下加紧扩军备战。
    鲍德温的文章，竭力鼓吹美国海外军事基地，特别是导弹基地，对保持美国的“威慑力量”以及它在西太平洋、亚洲和大西洋的“地位”和“威信”的重要性。他公然说，海外基地“使得美国能够打有限的战争”。这篇文章除了其中的“防御”和“侵略”这类词儿应作反面的解释以外，清楚地表明了美国的战略意图，它特别强调美国在取得洲际导弹优势之前保持海外基地的战略意义。
    “纽约时报”发表的左面一幅地图，标明是“世界战略图”，右面的一幅标明是“欧洲形势图”。图例说明是：方格地区表示“共产党集团”，黑色地区表示“西方防御地区”，五角星表示“西方军事基地”，黑方格表示“共产党集团军事基地”，黑色导弹表示美国已建成的导弹基地，白色导弹表示美国计划兴建的导弹基地。左图的弧线表示以美国为中心的发射五千五百英里洲际导弹的射程范围，它包括苏联大部分、东欧社会主义国家、我国北部、朝鲜、蒙古的大半部、日本、意大利、西德、法国、挪威、瑞典、丹麦、格陵兰和加拿大。右图的三条弧线，表示美国从英国、意大利、土耳其发射的一千五百英里中程导弹的射程范围，其矛头都是指向苏联和东欧社会主义国家的。
    此外，“纽约时报”还在地图下以两栏显著地位摘引了北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议于1957年12月通过的关于在欧洲装置带核弹头的导弹的决议。
