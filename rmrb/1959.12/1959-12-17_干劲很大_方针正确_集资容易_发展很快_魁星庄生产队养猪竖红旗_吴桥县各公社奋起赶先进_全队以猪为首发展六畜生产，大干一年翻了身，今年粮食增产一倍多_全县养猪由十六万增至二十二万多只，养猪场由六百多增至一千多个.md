Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th - People's communes and production teams in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, are learning from the Kuixingzhuang Production Team of Wangqiansi Commune, which, with great enthusiasm, relies on the masses and self-reliance to solve the problems of piglets, pigsties, and pig feed, enabling the pig-raising industry to develop rapidly. By early December, the number of pigs raised in the county increased from 160,000 before the learning campaign to 223,675, the number of collectively-run pig farms increased from 630 to 1,032, and publicly-raised pigs increased from more than 56,000 to 85,500. Three production teams in the county have achieved one pig per mu of land, and fifty-three production teams have achieved one pig per person. Many poor teams have begun to change their appearance.

An important experience of the Kuixingzhuang Production Team in developing pig raising is: the leadership has great determination, the members have great enthusiasm, and they consult with the masses when they encounter difficulties, solving the problems of lack of piglets, pigsties, and pig feed. This production team used to have "little manure, barren land, and low grain yield"; after agricultural cooperativization, although production has developed somewhat, the grain yield has increased slowly, and about a quarter of the village's grain still had to be supplied by the state every year. In 1958, inspired by the General Line, communization, and the Great Leap Forward, the members of this production team set high goals and made up their minds to take pigs as the key link to develop six livestock productions and overturned their situation in one year of hard work. Now, the number of pigs raised by the entire team has increased from 17 before communization to 257 (including 77 raised by households), an average of more than six per household. The number of sheep, chickens, and large livestock has also developed rapidly. Due to the rapid development of animal husbandry and the increase in fertilizer, coupled with other reasons, this year's grain yield has increased by more than 100%. Not only is there no longer a shortage of grain, but there is also surplus grain, thereby changing the long-standing poverty situation.

In the process of raising pigs, the Kuixingzhuang Production Team did not have piglets, so the cadres took the lead, mobilizing the masses to invest in the purchase of piglets. Without pigsties, the cadres consulted with the members again, and the members collected 31 cartloads of broken bricks and more than 50 pieces of wood from their homes, and built more than 40 simple collective pig farm sheds in a few days. What to do if the pigs have nothing to eat? After the cadres and members discussed, many members took out yam vines, corn cobs, cotton scraps, etc. for the pigs to eat, collecting more than 16,000 catties, which sustained them through the winter. Later, men, women, old and young in the village all took action to store more than 60,000 catties of dried vegetables, and also ensiled yam vines, multi-spike sorghum stalks, etc. as feed.

The main reason for the unbalanced development of pig raising in Wuqiao County was that more than 120 poor teams (accounting for 12% of the total number of teams in the county) believed that their team's conditions were insufficient due to saline-alkali land and low grain yield, and some cadres and masses had a fear of difficulty in developing pig raising. Since the red banner of pig raising in Kuixingzhuang, a poor team, was raised high, it set a brilliant example for poor teams to quickly change their appearance. The county party committee firmly grasped this red banner and successively organized more than 3,000 people to visit and learn from Kuixingzhuang, which greatly inspired and encouraged these poor teams. The Tian Xiaoma Production Team of Xinzhuang Commune originally had the "four difficulties" argument of difficult pig sources, difficult funding, little feed, and no pigsties. After the branch secretary, Shen Zhongrang, visited Kuixingzhuang, he said to the members: "Our difficulties are not difficult. Kuixingzhuang's conditions are not as good as ours. If they can do it, why can't we!" Many teams believed that Kuixingzhuang had set an example for poor teams to eliminate poverty and had created a broad road from poverty to prosperity.

After carefully learning from the experience of the Kuixingzhuang team, the poor teams ran collective pig farms on a large scale, relying on the masses and self-reliance to solve the difficulties of insufficient funds and materials. After mobilizing the masses for "two contributions" (contributing ideas and suggestions) and "three investments" (investing bricks, materials, and funds), Wangtong Commune burned 180,000 bricks, the masses contributed more than 34,000 bricks, and 3,784 households invested 41,856 yuan, and the construction progress was very fast. The entire commune has now built 66 pig farms, raising 10,384 pigs. In order to solve the problem of piglet sources for future pig raising development, the production teams learned from Kuixingzhuang's experience of self-breeding and self-raising and vigorously selected and retained sows and boars. At present, the county has selected and retained 75,718 sows and 1,225 boars. 95% of the county's more than 35,000 mature sows have achieved full mating. (Attached picture)

    干劲很大　方针正确　集资容易　发展很快
    魁星庄生产队养猪竖红旗  吴桥县各公社奋起赶先进
    全队以猪为首发展六畜生产，大干一年翻了身，今年粮食增产一倍多
    全县养猪由十六万增至二十二万多只，养猪场由六百多增至一千多个
    新华社天津16日电　河北吴桥县各人民公社、生产队学习王谦寺公社魁星庄生产队鼓足干劲，依靠群众自力更生解决猪仔、猪圈、猪饲料的经验，使养猪事业得到迅速发展。到12月上旬，全县养猪数由学习前的十六万只增加到二十二万三千六百七十五只，集体养猪场由六百三十个增加到一千零三十二个，公养猪由五万六千多只增加到八万五千五百只。全县出现了一亩地一头猪的生产队三个，一人一头猪的生产队五十三个，不少穷队开始改变面貌。
    魁星庄生产队发展养猪事业中的重要经验是：领导上决心大，社员干劲大，有困难和群众商量，解决了缺乏猪仔、猪圈、猪饲料问题。这个生产队过去“粪少、地赖、粮食产量低”；农业合作化后，虽然生产有所发展，但是粮食产量增长得慢，全村每年仍有四分之一左右的粮食要靠国家供应。1958年，这个生产队的社员们在总路线、公社化与大跃进鼓舞下，立大志、下决心，以猪为纲，发展六畜生产，大干一年翻了身。现在全队养猪头数已由公社化以前的十七只发展到二百五十七只（其中户养七十七只），每户平均六只多。羊、鸡、大牲畜的数量也有很快的发展。由于畜牧业发展快，积肥多，再加上其他原因，今年粮食产量增长了一倍以上。不但不再缺粮，并且还有余粮，从而改变了历来的贫困面貌。
    魁星庄生产队在养猪过程中没有猪仔，就由干部带头，带动群众投资购买了猪仔。没有猪圈，干部又和社员商量，社员们把家里的棍棍棒棒，拆拆拾拾地凑了碎砖三十一车，木头五十多根，几天工夫就搭起了集体养猪场简易圈棚四十多间。猪没有吃的怎么办？干部和社员们商量后，很多社员将猪吃的山药蔓、玉米骨、棉花落等拿出来，凑起一万六千多斤，维持了一冬。以后全村男女老少又人人动手，贮存干菜六万多斤，还把山药蔓、多穗高粱秸等青贮起来做饲料。
    吴桥县原来养猪发展不平衡的主要原因，是有一百二十多个穷队（占全县总队数的12％）因为碱地多、粮食产量低等，部分干部群众认为自己队的条件不足，对发展养猪有畏难情绪。自从魁星庄这个穷队的养猪红旗高高树起以后，给穷队迅速改变面貌树立了一个光辉的榜样。县委紧紧抓住这面红旗，先后组织了三千多人次到魁星庄参观学习，使这些穷队受到了极大的启发和鼓舞。辛庄公社田小麻生产队原先有猪源难、资金难、饲料少、没猪圈的“四难”论调。支部书记沈重让参观了魁星庄回来后对社员们说：“咱们这难不算难，魁星庄的条件不如咱，人家能干，咱为什么不能干！”许多队都认为：魁星庄为穷队刨穷根树立了榜样，创出了一条由穷变富的康庄大道。
    各穷队认真学习了魁星庄队的经验后，大办集体养猪场，依靠群众，自力更生来解决资金、物料不足的困难。王瞳公社经过发动群众“两献”（献策、献计）、“三投”（投砖、投料、投资金），烧砖十八万块，群众献砖三万四千多块，三千七百八十四户社员投资四万一千八百五十六元，建场进度很快。全社现在已建成了六十六个养猪场，养猪一万零三百八十四头。为了解决今后发展养猪的仔源问题，各生产队学习了魁星庄自繁自养的经验，大力选留母猪和种猪。目前，全县已经选留出母猪七万五千七百一十八头，公种一千二百二十五头。全县有的三万五千多头适龄母猪，95％达到了全配满怀。（附图片）
