Focusing on Central Tasks While Teaching Basic Knowledge
Zhouzhuang Commune Persists in Giving Party Lectures for Five Years

(Our dispatch) The Party organization of Zhouzhuang People's Commune in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, has consistently adhered to the Party lecture system for the past five years. Through Party education, the more than six hundred Party members of this commune have continuously improved their class consciousness. The vast majority of Party members are energetic and take the lead in working hard. In various movements, they are recognized by the masses as models. In the large-scale water conservancy campaign last year, Party members accounted for 74% of the 610 labor models selected throughout the commune. During the summer harvest and planting this year, 78% of the advanced producers selected in the commune were Party members. Zhouzhuang Commune (formerly a township) has also gradually risen from a relatively backward area to become one of the advanced communes in the county. Compared with the bumper harvest of 1958, the average yield per unit area of three wheat crops in the commune increased by 41%, and rice and other crops increased by 64.1%, reaching 1,032 jin per mu.

The Party lecture education in Zhouzhuang Commune over the past five years has been persisted in on the basis of continuous improvement. At the beginning of the Party lectures, the principle of "what to do, what to talk about" was overemphasized, and the content of the Party lectures mainly focused on current work. Although this was beneficial to completing the central tasks, it limited the improvement of Party members' political and ideological level. Later, it was limited to simply explaining the basic knowledge of the Party, without mentioning current work and production at all. In this way, Party members felt that "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." After a period of exploration, it was determined that when giving Party lectures, it is necessary to start from the current central tasks, link them to the Party's guidelines, policies, and basic knowledge, and educate Party members on how to establish correct positions, viewpoints, and methods in various tasks. In this way, each Party lecture can not only improve the Party members' level of understanding but also directly promote the central tasks. For example, during the summer planting this year, the density and specifications of rice transplanting were determined after mass discussions. However, at the beginning of transplanting, some commune members casually did not implement the regulations, and Party members did not intervene when they saw it. In response to this situation, the commune Party committee gave Party members a Party lecture on "How Should a Communist Party Member Correctly Treat Rational Close Planting?" By summarizing the past experience of high yields through close planting, the importance of rational close planting was explained, and it was pointed out that Party members should not stand idly by when some people do not transplant seedlings according to regulations. After the lecture, there was no seedling in the entire commune that was not transplanted according to specifications. After the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the Party committee organized Party members to attend Party lectures to study the resolutions of the plenary session. Combined with the task of accumulating manure, Party members were educated to muster greater enthusiasm and lead all commune members to concentrate on accumulating manure, in preparation for the continued leap forward in production next year. After studying and improving their ideological understanding, many Party members led the masses in a vigorous manure accumulation campaign. In five days, the amount of manure accumulated per mu of land increased from 76 dan to 126 dan.

One of the reasons why the Party lecture system in Zhouzhuang Commune has been adhered to for five years is that the Party lecture education has adopted a variety of forms. In terms of lectures, there are large lectures and small lectures. When the commune Party committee convenes Party member meetings to inspect and deploy work, it often seizes the main problems in the current work and in the thinking of Party members to give Party members large lectures. Each branch gives Party members small lectures in light of the specific circumstances of the branch. Large lectures are irregular, and small lectures are generally held twice a month. In addition to lectures, various exhibitions are also held. In February of this year, the commune Party committee drew a series of pictures showing two kinds of thinking, two kinds of styles, and two kinds of results based on the different ideological styles of Party members, and organized all Party members to visit them. In June, the deeds of advanced units that persisted in patient persuasion and education in their work and the deeds of Communist Party members who worked hard and lived plainly were exhibited to educate Party members. Party members generally believe that these practices have been very profound in their education. During the post-class discussion, it is also combined with the organizational life of the Party group, and criticism and self-criticism are carried out in connection with reality. The combination of these forms not only enabled the Party lectures to be persisted in for a long time, but also vigorously promoted the current central tasks.

The Party lecture teachers in Zhouzhuang Commune are all served by the commune Party committee secretary, Party committee members, and branch secretaries with higher levels. In order to teach well, they all take the lead in learning. In addition to collectively studying relevant documents and instructions from higher authorities at each meeting, Party committee members also pay attention to squeezing time for self-study in their daily work. Most members subscribe to Party newspapers and Party publications such as "Red Flag" and "Masses," and read relevant pamphlets on Party member education. They said: "If you don't study yourself and don't have anything in your stomach, not only will you not be able to teach the Party lectures well, but you will also have a lot of blindness in your work."

### 既谈中心工作　又讲基本知识  周庄公社五年来坚持上党课

    既谈中心工作　又讲基本知识
    周庄公社五年来坚持上党课
    本报讯　江苏省江阴县周庄人民公社的党组织，五年来一贯坚持党课制度。这个公社的六百多名党员，通过党课教育，阶级觉悟不断提高，绝大多数党员朝气蓬勃，带头苦干，在各种运动中都是群众公认的模范。去年大办水利运动中，全公社选出的六百一十名劳动模范，党员占74％；今年夏收夏种中，全公社选出的先进生产者，78％是党员。周庄公社（原乡）也由原来工作比较落后而逐渐上升为全县的先进公社之一。与大丰收的1958年比较，今年全社三麦的单位面积产量平均增长41％，水稻等增长64.1％，达到亩产一千零三十二斤。
    周庄公社五年来的党课教育，是在不断改进和提高的基础上坚持下来的。刚开始上党课时过于强调“做什么，讲什么”的原则，党课内容主要谈当前的工作，这样，对完成中心工作虽有好处，但对提高党员的政治思想水平却有局限性。后来，只限于单纯地讲解党的基础知识，根本不谈当前的工作和生产。这样，党员又感到“远水不解近渴”。经过一段时期的摸索，才确定在讲党课时，既要从当前中心工作出发，又要联系到党的方针、政策和党的基本知识，并教育党员如何在各种工作中树立正确的立场、观点和方法。这样，每次党课不仅能提高党员的认识水平，而且直接推动了中心工作。例如今年夏种时，插秧的密度和规格是经过群众讨论确定的。但在插秧开始时，有些社员随便不执行规定，党员看见后也不过问。针对这一情况，公社党委便给党员上了一次“共产党员应当怎样正确对待合理密植”的党课。通过总结以往密植丰产的经验，说明合理密植的重要性，并指出有人不按规定插秧，党员不应袖手旁观。课后，全公社再没有一块秧苗插得不合规格。党的八届八中全会文件公布后，党委就组织党员上党课学习全会的决议，并且结合积肥任务，教育党员鼓起更大的干劲，带领全体社员突击积肥，为明年生产的继续跃进作准备。许多党员经过学习提高了思想认识，便带领群众大搞积肥运动。五天功夫，每亩田的积肥量，就由七十六担上升到一百二十六担。
    周庄公社的党课制度能够五年如一日地长期坚持，原因之一是党课教育采用了多种多样的形式。在讲课方面有大课和小课。公社党委在召开党员大会、检查、布置工作的时候，往往抓住当前工作中和党员思想上的主要问题，给党员上大课。各支部则联系本支部的具体情况，给党员上小课。大课不定期，小课一般每月两次。除了讲课，还举办各种展览。今年2月，公社党委根据党员的不同思想作风，绘成了两种思想、两种作风、两种结果的连环图画，组织全体党员参观。6月份，又展出了在工作中坚持耐心说服教育的先进单位和艰苦朴素的共产党员的事迹，向党员进行教育。党员普遍认为这些作法对自己的教育很深刻。在课后讨论时，又和党小组的组织生活结合起来，联系实际进行批评和自我批评。这些形式互相结合，不但使党课长期坚持了下来，而且有力地推动了当前的中心工作。
    周庄公社的党课教员，都由公社党委书记、党委委员和水平较高的支部书记担任。为了教好课，他们都带头学习。党委成员除了在每次召开会议时，集体学习有关文件和上级的指示外，在日常工作中，还注意挤时间自学。大部分委员都订了党报和“红旗”、“群众”等党刊，并阅读有关党员教育的小册子。他们说：“自己不学习，肚中没有货，不但党课上不好，工作中也会产生很大盲目性。”
