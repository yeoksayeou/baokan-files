Xinhua News Agency, December 12th, Jakarta News: Indonesian Overseas Chinese newspapers and Chinese newspapers have continuously published commentaries, calling on the Indonesian government to immediately stop local anti-Chinese activities and, in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference and the spirit of the Joint Communiqué of the Foreign Ministers of China and Indonesia, to resolve the issue of Overseas Chinese through consultations with the Chinese government.

The Jakarta Chinese newspaper "Sin Po" pointed out in an editorial on November 26th regarding the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese in West Java that the vast majority of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia and the people of both countries who eagerly desire China-Indonesia friendship sincerely hope that Indonesia will stop the forced relocation of Overseas Chinese.

The editorial pointed out that if they are forced to move the Overseas Chinese from the rural areas below the county level, where they have long been settled, the consequence will inevitably be displacement. The editorial said that if the Indonesian government values ​​the spirit of humanitarianism and cherishes the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, this serious and tragic consequence should not be ignored.

The newspaper's editorial on November 14th, when talking about the Overseas Chinese in Cibadak who were ordered to move, pointed out that these Overseas Chinese, who have lived locally for generations and contributed to the local prosperity, have become refugees overnight. The newspaper said that some Indonesian people in some areas also sympathize with the Overseas Chinese who are being forced to move, and some even shed tears of sympathy.

The Jakarta "Life Daily" editorial on November 12th, when talking about the difficult situation of many Overseas Chinese who have been forced to move or are facing the threat of forced relocation, said that the places designated for Overseas Chinese to live are precisely the places that are often attacked by the armies of Indonesian rebel groups. After the Overseas Chinese move in, they will probably suffer a catastrophe, even their lives and the few items they need around them. The newspaper hopes that the Indonesian government will stop the unreasonable forced relocation and not force them to a dead end.

The "Life Daily" editorial on November 3rd also pointed out that the ban on Overseas Chinese residing in areas below the county level is for "public order and security," which is not convincing. The editorial pointed out that Overseas Chinese throughout Indonesia are law-abiding residents. People can see clearly that Overseas Chinese are friends of Indonesia, not enemies of Indonesia, and are maintainers of public order and security, not destroyers.

The Surabaya "Great Public Commercial Daily" editorial on November 12th said that forcing Overseas Chinese small vendors to move away cannot be said to be reasonable, whether from Indonesia's standpoint, the diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia, or the international moral standpoint. The newspaper said that the ink of the Joint Communiqué of the Foreign Ministers of China and Indonesia is not yet dry, and all the facts of friendship between the two countries and friendly visits are still vivid in people's minds, but Indonesia has launched anti-Chinese activities, treating China as an enemy country. This is truly unprecedented and unheard of in international history.

The newspapers also generally refuted the argument that "the Overseas Chinese economy is a colonial economy." The Jakarta "Sin Po" pointed out in an editorial published in October that the Overseas Chinese economy is different from the colonial economy. Colonial imperialists use military, political, and economic methods to exploit and extract as much as possible in the colonies, while Overseas Chinese in their places of residence work hard, overcome obstacles, and use blood and sweat to accumulate wealth, contributing to the prosperity and development of the local economy.

The newspaper pointed out in another article that what truly hinders Indonesia's economic development is foreign monopoly capital. The profits obtained by foreign capital from Indonesia amount to 15 billion rupiahs per year. The total profit obtained by Western oil companies from Indonesia in 1954 reached 6.6 billion rupiahs.

The "Awakening Weekly" pointed out in an editorial that Overseas Chinese capital and monopoly capital are essentially different. Overseas Chinese capital has made, is making, and will continue to make positive contributions to Indonesia's economic development.

Newspaper commentaries generally called for maintaining the friendly relations between China and Indonesia and warned against the imperialist conspiracy to undermine the friendship between the two countries. The "Kuang Lu Daily" published in Makassar published an article on November 17th saying that the purpose of anti-Chinese activities is to divert the attention of the Indonesian people from the struggle against imperialist political and economic aggression and to undermine the friendship between China and Indonesia. The "Daily Telegraph" in Makassar pointed out in an editorial on November 11th that friends will regret Indonesia's anti-Chinese actions, while enemies will be happy, and this action is falling into the trap of imperialism, which attempts to undermine the unity of Asian and African countries. The "Sumatra Minbao," "National Daily," and the "Dawn Daily" published in Pontianak all generally called for resolving the issue of Overseas Chinese through consultation in accordance with the spirit of the Bandung Principles and the Joint Communiqué of the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, so that the friendly relations between China and Indonesia can be consolidated and developed.

    印度尼西亚华侨报纸和中文报纸呼吁当局制止排华活动
    不要以友为敌　徒使亲痛仇快
    要求根据万隆原则通过协商解决华侨问题
    新华社12日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚华侨报纸和中文报纸连续发表评论，要求印度尼西亚政府立即制止当地的排华活动，并且根据万隆会议的原则以及中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长联合公报的精神，同中国政府通过协商解决有关华侨的问题。
    雅加达中文报纸“新报”在11月26日就西爪哇迫迁华侨发表社论指出，印度尼西亚广大华侨和热望中国—印度尼西亚友好的两国人民都殷切地希望印度尼西亚停止迫迁华侨。
    社论指出，如果硬要强迫把县以下地区的华侨从他们长久以来就定居的乡下迁走，其后果一定是使他们流离失所。社论说，如果印度尼西亚政府重视人道主义精神，珍视中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系，这个严重悲惨的后果是不应该忽视的。
    这家报纸11月14日的社论在谈到被勒令迁移的芝巴德华侨时指出，这些世代在当地居住、为当地繁荣贡献了力量的华侨一朝就变成了难民。报纸说，有些地区的印度尼西亚人民也对被逼迁的华侨寄以同情，有的还流下了同情之泪。
    雅加达“生活报”11月12日的社论在谈到许多被强迫迁走或面临迫迁威胁的华侨的困难处境时说，指定华侨居住的那些地方正是经常遭受印度尼西亚叛乱集团的军队侵袭的地方，恐怕华侨住进以后连性命及些少身边应用物品都不免要遭受浩劫。这家报纸希望印度尼西亚政府制止不合理的迫迁行动，不要逼他们走上绝路。
    “生活报”11月3日的社论还指出，禁止华侨在县以下地区居住是为了“公共秩序和治安”，这种说法是不能令人信服的。社论指出，在印度尼西亚各地的华侨都是守法的居民。人们都可以看清楚，华侨是印度尼西亚的友人，而不是印度尼西亚的敌人，是公共秩序和治安的维护者，而不是破坏者。
    泗水“大公商报”11月12日的社论说，迫令华侨小商贩迁走，无论从印度尼西亚的立场，中国和印度尼西亚的邦交关系上，或者国际道义立场上，都不能说是合理的。报纸说，中国—印度尼西亚两国外交部长的联合公报墨沈未干，一切两国友好的事实、亲善访问仍历历在人们的心目中，而印度尼西亚掀起排华活动来，把中国看成敌国一样。这在国际历史上，真是见所未见、闻所未闻的。
    各报还普遍驳斥了“华侨经济是殖民主义经济”的论调。雅加达“新报”在10月间发表的一篇社论中指出，华侨经济不同于殖民主义经济。殖民帝国主义者通过军事、政治、经济的方法，在殖民地尽量剥削榨取，而华侨在侨居地，胼手胝足，披荆斩棘，用流血流汗的方法去积累财富，对当地经济的繁荣与发展尽了力量。
    这家报纸在另一篇文章中指出，真正阻碍印度尼西亚经济发展的是外国垄断资本。外国资本从印度尼西亚获取的利润每年达一百五十亿盾。西方石油公司1954年从印度尼西亚获得的利润总额达六十六亿盾。
    “觉醒周刊”在一篇社论中指出，华侨资本和垄断资本在本质上是截然不同的。华侨资本过去、现在和将来都可以对印度尼西亚的经济发展作出积极的贡献。
    各报评论普遍要求维护中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系，警惕帝国主义破坏两国友谊的阴谋。望加锡出版的“匡庐日报”11月17日发表文章说，排华活动的目的是想转移印度尼西亚人民对于反对帝国主义政治和经济侵略斗争的注意力，并且破坏中国和印度尼西亚的友谊。望加锡的“每日电讯”在11月11日的社论中指出，对于印度尼西亚的排华行动，朋友们将感到遗憾，而敌人将会感到高兴，这种行动正是上了帝国主义的圈套，帝国主义企图破坏亚非国家的团结。“苏门答腊民报”、“民族日报”、坤甸出版的“黎明报”在社论中都一般要求根据万隆原则和两国外长联合公报的精神协商解决华侨问题，使中国和印度尼西亚的友好关系得到巩固和发展。
