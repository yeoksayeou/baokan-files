Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th December: The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace today published a letter from Mr. Bernal, Executive Chairman of the Presidential Committee of the World Peace Council, written on November 24th from London to the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace. The letter expresses support for the struggle of the Vietnamese and Lao people to demand the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements on the Lao issue. The letter points out that the actions of the Kingdom of Laos government and the United States in violating the Geneva Agreements on Laos have aroused the indignation of people all over the world, hindering the easing of the international situation and intensifying the crisis of war.

The letter states, "The World Peace Council strongly supports the appeals issued by the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Lao Patriotic Front on the Lao issue."

The letter also states, "Everyone clearly sees that the conspiracy to use the United Nations banner to disguise foreign intervention has gone bankrupt."

The letter says, "Only strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements can guarantee peace in Laos. All peace-loving people and organizations must emphasize this point, oppose actions that violate the above agreements, and demand that the International Commission for Laos resume its activities."

The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace today also published a statement by Bernal on the Lao authorities' violation of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements.

After elaborating on the provisions of the Geneva Agreements on the Lao issue and the acts violating the agreements since the Sana Nikone administration came to power, the statement pointed out that "Sana Nikone's actions cannot be regarded as belonging to Laos' internal affairs. It is a blatant and direct violation of international agreements that the Lao Kingdom authorities once recognized, and may lead to new suffering and new wars, intensify the Cold War atmosphere, and hinder the development of the international situation in the direction of negotiation and peaceful resolution."

The statement said, "We oppose the Lao Kingdom authorities' illegal arrest of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and oppose acts that violate the above-mentioned agreements. We demand that the Lao Kingdom authorities, for the benefit of mankind and world peace, must strictly implement the agreements that have been signed."

Xinhua News Agency, 12th December: TASS, Moscow, 11th December: It is reported that the British government has rejected the Soviet government's proposal to jointly send a letter to the Lao government regarding the Lao authorities' preparation to interrogate the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The Soviet government's proposal to the British government pointed out that the Lao government's decision to interrogate the leaders of the Lao Movement directly violated the Geneva Agreements on Laos, which cannot but cause further sharpening of the Lao situation and intensify the tense situation in the entire Indochina.

The draft joint letter proposed by the Soviet government suggested that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference would appeal to the Lao government to cooperate with the International Commission for Supervision and Control. The two chairmen believe that it is necessary to allow the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos to review the accusations against the leaders of the Lao Movement and to offer its authoritative judgment on this issue in the spirit of the Geneva Agreements.

In its reply to the Soviet proposal, the British government attempted to find excuses for its negative attitude, saying that the Geneva Agreements cannot prevent the Lao authorities from legally interrogating the leaders of the Patriotic Front who violated Lao law after the signing of the Lao armistice agreement.

However, everyone knows that after the Lao armistice, all activities of the leaders of the Lao fighting forces were aimed at achieving peace and unity throughout the country. The Lao Patriotic Front, which was supported by a broad spectrum of people in the country, had proposed holding negotiations with representatives of the Sana Nikone government. It has made every effort to eliminate the abnormal situation created by the current Sana Nikone government's sabotage of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements. Under such circumstances, the Sana Nikone government's decision to hand over the leaders of the Patriotic Front to the court for punishment is nothing more than a provocation to please certain foreign groups, to undermine the Geneva Agreements on Indochina and to aggravate the situation in Southeast Asia.

    世界和平理事会声援越南和老挝人民的斗争
    美萨集团违反协议行动激起世界公愤
    英政府无理拒绝苏联关于联合致函老挝当局的建议
    新华社河内11日电　越南保卫世界和平委员会今天公布了世界和平理事会主席团执行主席贝尔纳在11月24日从伦敦写给越南保卫世界和平委员会的一封信，信中表示支持越南人民和老挝人民要求严正履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的斗争。信中指出，老挝王国政府和美国违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议的行动引起了全世界人民的公愤，阻碍国际局势的缓和，加剧了战争的危机。
    信中说，“世界和平理事会大力支持越南保卫世界和平委员会和老挝爱国战线党就老挝问题所发表的呼吁书。”
    信中还说，“大家都清楚地看到用联合国的招牌来为外国的干涉作伪装的阴谋已经破产了。”
    信中说，“只有严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，才能保障老挝的和平。爱好和平的一切人和一切组织必须强调这一点，反对违反上述协议的行动，并要求老挝国际委员会恢复活动。”
    越南保卫世界和平委员会今天同时公布了贝尔纳就老挝当局违反日内瓦协议和万象协议发表的声明。
    声明在阐述关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的规定和培·萨纳尼空执政以来违反协定的行为后指出，“萨纳尼空的行为不能视为属于老挝的内政问题，它明目张胆的直接违反了老挝王国当局曾经承认的国际协议，并可能导致新的痛苦和新的战争，加剧了冷战气氛，阻碍了国际局势朝着协商和和平解决的方向发展。”
    声明说，“我们反对老挝王国当局非法逮捕苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人，反对违反上述各项协议的行为，我们要求老挝王国当局为了人类和世界和平的利益，必须严格履行已经签订的协议。”
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：据悉，英国政府已经拒绝了苏联政府提出的关于就老挝当局准备审讯老挝爱国战线党领导人一事联合致函老挝政府的建议。
    苏联政府向英国政府提出的这项建议指出，老挝政府审讯寮国运动的领导人的决定直接违反了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，这不能不引起老挝局势进一步尖锐化和加剧整个印度支那的紧张局势。
    苏联政府提出的联合信件草案建议，日内瓦会议的两位主席将呼吁老挝政府同国际监察和监督委员会合作。两位主席认为必须让老挝国际监察和监督委员会有可能来审查对寮国运动的领导人提出的控告和根据日内瓦协议的精神就这个问题提出自己权威的判断。
    英国政府在对苏联建议的答复中，企图为它的否定态度寻找借口，说什么日内瓦协议不能妨碍老挝当局依法审讯在老挝停战协定签订后违反老挝法律的爱国战线党的领导人。
    然而，大家知道，老挝停战以后，寮国战斗部队领导人的全部活动都是为了取得全国的和平和统一。受到国内广大阶层人民支持的老挝爱国战线党曾经建议同萨纳尼空政府代表举行谈判。它尽了一切努力来消除目前萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议所产生的不正常局势。在这种情况下，萨纳尼空政府决定把爱国战线党领导人交与法庭惩办的做法，无非是为了讨好某些外国集团的一种挑衅，来破坏关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议和加剧东南亚的局势。
