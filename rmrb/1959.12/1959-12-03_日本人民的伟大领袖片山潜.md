The name of Katayama Sen is not only closely linked with the democratic and revolutionary movements in Japan, but also with the world peace and communist movements. He was the greatest and most influential revolutionary in the world, originating from the Japanese working class. The Japanese working class is proud to have such a great predecessor.

Currently, the broad masses of the Japanese people are preparing to commemorate the centenary of Katayama Sen's birth (December 3). At the same time, to commemorate the centenary of Katayama Sen's birth, leaders of the worker's movements in the Soviet Union, China, France, Britain, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Mongolia, and other countries have written many articles introducing his life and deeds. These facts prove that he was an outstanding leader of the Japanese people and a revolutionary with global influence.

He passed away in Moscow twenty-six years ago due to illness. However, when we today trace the occurrence and development of the movements of workers, peasants, and other working people in our country, and the occurrence and development of the peace movement, the movement for international solidarity, and the movement of our Communist Party, we always see that these movements are inseparable from Katayama Sen. He was the one who first taught the workers in Japan the methods of organization and struggle.

Now, the peace movement in Japan has greatly developed, and the movement to strengthen international solidarity is flourishing. Everyone knows that the initial foundation of these movements was laid by Katayama Sen through a series of activities at home and abroad before and after the Russo-Japanese War. Moreover, his leadership had a decisive influence on the later development of these movements in some cases. Therefore, his cause has not been interrupted by his death, and his cause is still growing and developing vigorously today.

Katayama Sen's footprints are all over the world. His works range from discussing the essence of Marxism-Leninism to commenting on drama, covering a very wide range. His achievements can be summarized as the following five points:

First, he was the earliest organizer and leader of the Japanese workers' movement;

Second, he was the earliest propagandist of socialist ideas and the organizer of the socialist movement in Japan;

Third, he was the founder and leader of the Japanese Communist Party;

Fourth, he was a staunch and unyielding fighter against war and for peace;

Fifth, he was an outstanding proletarian internationalist and supporter of national liberation movements.

I. The Earliest Organizer and Leader of the Japanese Workers' Movement

In 1868, the new rulers of Japan, who struck a blow at the Japanese feudal system, adopted advanced European and American systems in order to promote the development of capitalism. As a result, the industrial revolution, especially in the textile and transportation sectors, achieved rapid development. At the same time, the modern working class also grew up. The new class contradictions between labor and capital also arose and gradually became acute.

It was in such a turbulent period that Katayama Sen was born as the son of a farmer. He spent his youth working and studying part-time. Later, he went to the United States to work and study, where he observed the advanced American capitalist society and the labor and socialist movements. He returned to Japan with the determination to devote his life to solving social problems. From that time until his death half a century later, he devoted his life to the cause of human liberation with firm will.

After returning to Japan, Katayama Sen immediately went deep into the worker masses and actively participated in the organizational work of the trade unions that were being prepared at that time.

December 1, 1897, is a memorable day in the history of the Japanese labor movement. On this day, the "Ironworkers' Union," the earliest metalworkers' union with modern organizational content, was established; and "Labor World," the earliest workers' magazine in Japan, was published. Katayama Sen served as the secretary of the union and the editor-in-chief of the magazine. These two aspects of work played a great guiding role in the subsequent workers' struggles.

Katayama Sen contributed greatly to establishing a long-term organization centered on the most advanced metal machinery workers among the workers. Before he began his activities, he personally participated in the workers' struggles, such as the mass struggles of miners, silk mill girls, and rickshaw pullers. However, these struggles were often temporary or spontaneous, and some had the nature of assisting the Freedom and People's Rights Movement. Through the hard work of Katayama Sen and other leaders, the consciousness of the worker masses was raised, and they united to improve their living conditions and organized their own trade unions.

In the years of rapid industrial development after the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), especially in the years of the development of large enterprises, Katayama Sen had direct contact with the inevitable driving force of the new era—the workers—and abandoned the reformist position, taking the first step towards Marxism and communism.

On the one hand, Katayama Sen organized and led the workers who were under the cruel labor conditions before the capitalist era to fight for their lives and rights; on the other hand, in order to guarantee the results of the struggle by law, he also advocated the formulation of laws such as the Factory Law and the Worker Protection Law, and actively carried out activities to achieve this goal. Due to his efforts, Japan later formulated laws to protect workers, although this law was only preliminary at that time.

After the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), Japan faced a new period of industrial development. Influenced by the first Russian Revolution, the struggle of Japanese workers became more intense, and sometimes even riots occurred. Although he was not a supporter of riots, he believed that it was unavoidable for Japanese workers without the freedom of association and the freedom to strike to take such actions. He advocated protecting workers, fighting for the freedom of association and the freedom to strike, and demanding the abolition of repressive regulations—the Public Peace Police Law.

He brought these views to the worker masses and launched propaganda work throughout the country. In 1910, the Tennoist government fabricated the so-called "plot to assassinate the Emperor" and arrested twenty-four anarchists and socialists, including Kotoku Shusui, and sent twelve of them to the guillotine. At this time, Katayama Sen showed his excellent qualities. He did not succumb to persecution. The "Marxist socialist groups" centered on him continued to carry out calm propaganda activities among the workers. Although we only held lectures, we used socialist viewpoints to explain the facts and events about society and politics in the lectures. (Katayama Sen, "The Labor Movement in Japan")

At the end of 1911, the strike of six thousand employees of the Tokyo Municipal Tram Company, which shook Japan, continued for four days and finally won. The leader of this large-scale struggle was Katayama Sen. Because of this strike, he was arrested and thrown into prison. After his release from prison, the reactionaries never relaxed their persecution of him. In order to seek freedom, he was forced to go to the United States. Since then, until his death, he had never been able to set foot again on the land of his beloved motherland.

From the above description, it can be seen that Katayama Sen was the earliest pioneer in Japan to organize workers to struggle and enlighten their class consciousness. At the same time, in these practices, Katayama Sen's own thoughts also developed. His talents continued to grow, and he finally became an outstanding mass politician.

No matter how difficult the situation, Katayama Sen always unswervingly adhered to the position of the working class. One of the reasons why he was able to do this was that whether in Japan or in the United States, he not only consciously lived as a worker; but after he became the leader of the labor movement, he often shared weal and woe with the worker masses and tried to maintain close ties with the workers. Some famous leaders of his time, such as Kotoku Shusui, Nishikawa Kojiro, Abe Isoo, and Sakai Toshihiko, later became anarchists, reformists, and social democrats, and left the revolutionary road. Only Katayama Sen embarked on the correct path of true revolutionary and scientific socialism. An important reason for this was that he constantly maintained close ties with the masses.

II. The Earliest Propagandist and Organizer of Socialism

Katayama Sen was already known as a socialist during his first study abroad in the United States. He was deeply influenced by the German Social Democratic Party, especially Lassalle's remarks. But at that time, his thoughts were still mixed with a considerable amount of social reformist ideas.

When he promoted the trade union movement as a worker's own movement and demanded legal guarantees to improve the status of the working class, parliament and universal suffrage naturally became his goals. In October 1899, he began to organize the "League for the Promotion of Universal Suffrage." Since then, promoting universal suffrage has become an important struggle during his stay in Japan.

However, Katayama Sen's thinking also developed with the development of the working class struggle. In October 1898, he and Kotoku Shusui and other comrades organized the Socialist Research Association. As he himself wrote, this research association studied various socialist theories, "After many serious discussions, we came to the conclusion that we are convinced that only Marxism is the real theory that we should adopt and practice." At this time, he accepted Marxism for the first time. In January 1900, the research association was renamed the "Socialist Association." This association became the representative group of Japanese socialist forces in the Second International and a group for propagating socialism.

Universal suffrage combined with socialism inevitably requires a class political movement. Katayama Sen once said: "At the annual meeting of the Japan Railway Workers' Union held in Omiya City in March 1901, a resolution was passed stating that socialism is the only way to fundamentally solve labor problems and instructing the Executive Committee to participate in the movement to fight for universal suffrage. …At this time, the clear socialist stance shown by the resolution of the Japan Railway Workers' Union and many other characteristics of this era convinced us that our working class was quite prepared for political movements. Therefore... we established the Social Democratic Party, a socialist political party."

This party was not yet a Marxist party. There were particular problems with the emphasis on constitutionalism. However, their purpose was to safeguard the current interests of the working people and to use the parliament as a forum in the struggle for universal suffrage. Therefore, this movement was indeed in line with the wishes of the masses at that time. This party was the earliest party in Japan to call for being based on the working class.

The Japanese Social Democratic Party was banned by the government on the first day of its establishment. However, its party-building declaration was widely disseminated. The Social Democratic Party played a role in promoting the development of the socialist movement; aroused repercussions among the working masses; and also exposed the reactionary essence of the Tenno system. In fact, from the banning of the Social Democratic Party until the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Japanese Social Democrats widely propagated socialism. Katayama Sen conducted activities centered on "Labor World" and traveled around the country to conduct propaganda.

In 1903, Katayama Sen published the book "My Socialism." He wrote in the "Preface" to this book that this book is "an accusation against today's society, that is, against the corrupt, gold-almighty, and capitalist-ridden society."

His concept of social revolution was already quite clear. He pointed out that as the order of social development, the capitalist system is about to perish. "Today, with the development of industry, the power of capitalists will become stronger. They will use the power of the past and the power they now have to resist the forces of social development and conflict with progressive forces. Thus, we have to believe that a social revolution will inevitably occur." That is, capitalists and workers compete for social control,…

"Therefore, we can assert that the central issue of social revolution is that workers want to seize political power and capitalists resist this." Katayama Sen boldly promoted socialist ideas, and his achievements are something we cannot forget.

In August 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, when the Second International Congress was held in Amsterdam, Katayama Sen attended the congress as a representative of Japan. At this congress, he fought against the revisionism of the time, standing on the position of orthodox Marxists. In 1907, Katayama Sen said: "I am carrying out the movement with the Social Democratic International (Second International) as the standard." From this, it can be seen that under the circumstances at that time, he had clearly stood on the position of internationalism. This point must be emphasized.

After the Russo-Japanese War, the labor movement and the socialist movement became more active than after the Sino-Japanese War due to the influence of the Russian Revolution. Due to industrial development, rising prices, and the increase in the number of unemployed people, unprecedentedly fierce struggles were launched in the Ashio Copper Mine and the Besshi Copper Mine.

Socialists who bravely fought against the war during the war united in February 1906 to establish the Japanese Socialist Party, hoping to contribute to the movement of the new era. Needless to say, Katayama Sen actively participated in it. However, in 1907, the Japanese Socialist Party launched a debate on the issue of "adopting parliamentary policy or direct action." The representative who advocated direct action was Kotoku Shusui, and the representative who advocated parliamentary policy was Katayama Sen. The government took advantage of this internal split to order the ban on the Socialist Party and further strengthened the cruel suppression.

From this time until 1917, it was the "dark age of the Japanese socialist movement." Katayama Sen pointed out the reasons for this as follows:

Socialists failed to establish a great influence among the working class after the Russo-Japanese War. "When the Party... was banned, only a very small number of socialist intellectuals and anarcho-syndicalists remained. That is to say, it was as if there were two hostile regimental commanders, and neither of the two regimental commanders led the army." In this way, the movement will inevitably stagnate.

"I am no match for intellectuals in writing theoretical articles and expressing opinions. But I can write for the working class, speak to the working class, and be able to explain their thoughts and activities."

In fact, after 1907, Katayama Sen constantly carried out vivid socialist propaganda to the workers through "Social News," focusing on the problems faced at that time. In the era when the suppression was extremely cruel, he still went to various places to conduct propaganda speeches. His words and deeds are the attitude that a true revolutionary socialist should take.

Today, the Japanese Communist Party inherits the attitude and theory adopted by Katayama Sen in his activities, and is doing its best, and must do its best, to develop it.

III. The Founder and Leader of the Japanese Communist Party

Katayama Sen played a significant role in the founding of our Japanese Communist Party.

The October Revolution of 1917 in Russia opened a new era for world history. The advanced elements of Japan supported this revolution. The secret congratulatory letter sent by Japanese workers to the young Soviet state read:

"Our concern and attention are focused on the progress of the Russian Revolution. We watch the progress of the Russian proletariat with deep sympathy. It has left an indelible impression on the minds of the Japanese masses."

Katayama Sen, who was in the United States at the time, immediately and unhesitatingly expressed his support for the victory of the Russian Revolution. This was a natural thing for him. Because in 1904 he had stated in Amsterdam: "Workers are all compatriots and should unite to stop the war." Moreover, when the Second International announced its support for the war with the outbreak of World War I, Katayama Sen supported the resolutions of the Zimmerwald and Kienthal conferences and Lenin's position.

On the one hand, Katayama Sen supported the Russian Revolution; at the same time, in the United States, he actively participated in the work of establishing a new type of party—a Leninist party—to lead this revolution, and began to prepare to establish the same party in Japan.

In 1920, Katayama Sen read Lenin's "State and Revolution" in the United States and translated the book. Later, he said, "After reading 'State and Revolution,' I clarified the schedule for the transition from capitalism to socialism." From this, it can be seen that he had grasped the theoretical basis for establishing a Communist Party. At that time, social democratic tendencies and anarcho-syndicalist tendencies had a profound impact on the Japanese labor movement; therefore, Katayama Sen's theoretical work had great significance for the construction of the Communist Party.

On the other hand, due to the influence of the October Revolution, there were also great changes among Japanese workers. A practical example of this change was the "Rice Riots" in August 1918. This was the largest mass action that had ever occurred since the Meiji Restoration. The incident of attacking rice shops that occurred in a fishing village in Toyama Prefecture expanded to all parts of the country and finally developed into a huge movement with more than 10 million participants. The development of the democratic movement and the socialist movement after the war was all caused by this "Rice Riot." However, this historically significant mass action was finally subjected to bloody suppression by the government due to the lack of a revolutionary program and leadership. Katayama Sen wrote about this incident:

"Although Japanese socialists heard the news of the Russian October Revolution with such enthusiasm; however, they were not prepared to actively participate in this movement, nor did they intend to lead the masses in the right direction. The fundamental reason lies in the fact that they have no connection with the working class, nor do they want to establish contact with the working class. They are only satisfied with reciting the dogmas of Marxism."

Due to this situation, the activities to establish a Communist Party in Japan were not able to achieve practical results immediately. Therefore, it was very necessary to promote the work of party building with the assistance of foreign countries. Katayama Sen took the initiative to undertake this task. He was the first to propose that a Communist Party must be organized in Japan. In 1920, Katayama Sen published an article "Japan and the Increasingly Imminent Socialist Revolution" in Mexico. He wrote in the concluding part of the article:

"Here, I would like to especially emphasize that in order to defeat Japanese imperialism, the support of the world revolutionary army for the Japanese proletariat is unconditionally needed."

In this article, he clearly pointed out for the first time that a Communist Party must be established in Japan; and pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party must be organized as part of the world proletarian revolutionary force. Therefore, the Japanese Communist Party, which was born on July 15, 1922, was actually fully prepared by Katayama Sen from the ideological to the organizational level two years earlier.

However, Katayama Sen not only laid the foundation for the Japanese Communist Party. In December 1921, he went to the Soviet Union from Mexico according to the instructions of the Communist International in order to organize the Far Eastern Labor Congress. At the Far Eastern Labor Congress held in January 1922, he and the representatives sent by Japan made the decision to establish the Japanese Communist Party. The establishment of the Japanese Communist Party marked the beginning of a new era for the Japanese people's liberation movement.

Katayama Sen's leadership had a great impact on the later development of the Japanese Communist Party. The road that the Japanese Communist Party has traveled is by no means a smooth road. It has constantly waged uncompromising struggles against "left" and right opportunism. The arrests in June 1923 and the white terror during the earthquake in September of the same year caused great wavering among the wavering elements within the Party. They finally made a decision to temporarily disband the Japanese Communist Party in March 1924. Although Katayama Sen was abroad at the time, he overturned this decision. Until the Reestablishment Party Congress was held in December 1926, Katayama Sen never interrupted his leadership work for the Party.

Although the reestablished party cleared out the theories of the liquidationists such as Yamakawa; however, it also produced the "Fukumotoism" of "left" sectarianism and the tendency to deny the mass party of the proletariat. This guiding theory isolated the Japanese Party more and more from the masses. The Party program formulated in 1927 pointed out: "If it is wrong and fatal to advocate canceling the Party's (right-leaning) policy in the left-wing trade union movement, then it is equally wrong to isolate the Party in the mass organizations of the proletariat."

Katayama Sen played an important role in reaching this correct conclusion.

Before this, Katayama Sen's leadership was often neglected because of the existence of both "left" and right liquidationist tendencies in the Party. It was not until after 1928 that Katayama Sen's articles frequently played a guiding role in the Party's official publications. We must especially not forget that in strengthening the Party's ranks and waging irreconcilable struggles against opportunists, traitors, spies, and provocateurs, he always stood at the forefront and consistently struggled for the theoretical and organizational growth of the Japanese Communist Party.

IV. A Fighter Against War and for Peace

Katayama Sen stipulated at that time that the goal of the Japanese Communist Party was to overthrow Japanese militarism. As everyone knows, he was a resolute fighter against war and for peace. But before he became a communist, he was already a brave fighter against war and for peace. As early as 1901, the declaration of the Social Democratic Party, which was banned on the day of its establishment, contained the following passage:

"Secondly, what democracy is strongly opposed to is militarism. Today, the world's major powers are busy expanding their armaments and want to use strength to determine the right and wrong of problems. This is not only the enemy of mankind, but also seriously hinders the development of democracy. The purpose of the major powers in strengthening their armaments is to force weak countries to open up markets and expand the sales of their own goods; and to prevent the development of domestic democracy…" The program for conducting actual movements also mentioned the issue of "reducing armaments." Although the declaration of the Social Democratic Party was not drafted by Katayama Sen, it cannot be denied that this declaration clearly reflected his thoughts.

During the Russo-Japanese War, at the Second International Congress held in Amsterdam in 1904, Katayama Sen shook hands with Plekhanov, expressing that there was no resentment and hatred between the working classes, and expressing the determination to join hands to fight to stop the war. This Congress passed a resolution against the Russo-Japanese War. One passage read: "Relying on the strength of the social parties of various countries, try every means to oppose the expansion and long-term continuation of this war." Later, Katayama Sen faithfully and wholeheartedly implemented this resolution.

After the October Revolution, it was necessary to take a different attitude towards the issue of war than in the past. The aggressive war launched by the reactionary imperialists against the first proletarian state in human history was an unjust war; the war waged by the proletarian state against this aggression was just; therefore, the world working class must do everything possible to support this just war.

As a communist, Katayama Sen opposed launching an aggressive war against the world's first socialist country, and stood at the forefront of this struggle to fight. That is to say, the Soviet state, which had just been born after the October Revolution, was quickly threatened by the intervention and war of the imperialist countries. Japanese imperialism made the decision to send troops to Siberia a few days before the "Rice Riots" in August 1918, attempting to strangle the October Revolution and actually occupy the area east of Lake Baikal. At this time, Katayama Sen took the lead in fighting against sending troops to Siberia. In 1922, although he was old and weak, he still personally went to Siberia. The leaflets distributed to Japanese soldiers at that time were printed in his name.

For example, in Katayama Sen's "Sincere Advice from an Old Japanese Revolutionary to Japanese Soldiers in Siberia," he strongly appealed: "As a Japanese who loves his brothers, that is, loves Japanese workers and peasants more than his own life, I sincerely advise you: you should immediately withdraw from Siberia and return to your hometown." Katayama Sen's activities were one of the reasons for the failure of the Japanese army's invasion.

It was precisely because the Japanese Communist Party had been ideologically led by Katayama Sen before its founding that it was able to mobilize a wide range of nationals at home to participate in the "struggle against sending troops to Siberia" and the "rescue of starving Russia" and contribute to thwarting the ambitions of Japanese imperialism. In this way, the Japanese Communist Party was able to fulfill its most important international obligation to a certain extent at that time.

In September 1931, Japanese imperialism launched military operations and occupied Northeast China, thereby establishing a stronghold for attacking the Soviet Union. At that time, Katayama Sen actively led the struggle against the war of aggression. He established the International Anti-War Committee in Moscow and worked hard to prepare for the World Anti-War Congress. The convening of the Amsterdam Anti-War Congress in August 1932 was largely due to Katayama Sen's efforts.

Katayama Sen, who was seventy-four years old at the time, attended the congress. On the one hand, he recalled the World Congress held during the Russo-Japanese War twenty-eight years ago; on the other hand, he announced to the congress that there was a force in Japan that was fighting against the war of aggression launched by Japanese imperialism at that time despite the suppression, hoping that the whole world would support it, and demanding that the congress give assistance to the Chinese revolution. This greatly moved the participants in the congress. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the work of organizing the struggle against the warmongers headed by Japanese imperialism and establishing the anti-war and anti-fascist united front on a global scale began at this meeting.

As far as Japan is concerned, the Communist Party has fought against the Japanese militarism's launch of a war of aggression against China, and organized anti-war activities within the army. The Party was praised by fraternal parties around the world for this. Many heroes of whom we can be proud have emerged in this struggle. And it was Katayama Sen who set a brilliant example for this activity. We must carry forward this tradition today and in the future.

V. Internationalist and Supporter of National Liberation Movements Regarding Katayama Sen, I once wrote:

"One point that is particularly impressive is his deep sympathy for the oppressed nations. He always expressed great indignation at the unequal treatment they suffered and made his best efforts for their liberation. For example, when he was in the United States, he was a close friend of black people.… Therefore, after he went to Moscow, black people visiting Moscow from the United States always came to meet Katayama Sen to seek his assistance and advice. He also treated Communist Party members and students from Korea and China as warmly and kindly as he treated Japanese people.…

Therefore, it is said that after his death, old comrades from black, Chinese and Korean communities never forgot to visit Katayama Sen's tomb when they visited Moscow." ("Avant-Garde," November 1958)

Katayama Sen went to the United States when he was young and personally experienced the pain of racial discrimination. Katayama Sen opposed racial discrimination very early on. In October 1902, the Socialist Association passed a resolution to raise the issue of opposing racial discrimination and suggested that the World Socialist Party Congress (Amsterdam Congress), which was to be held shortly thereafter, discuss this issue.

Katayama Sen, who emphasized that workers are all compatriots at the Amsterdam Congress, later said:

"As pointed out in the colonial program submitted by Lenin to the Second Congress of the Communist International, striving for the freedom and liberation of weak nations is an important task of our proletarian revolutionary movement. Comrades, enabling the Ezo of Hokkaido and the aborigines of Taiwan to gain freedom and liberation is the cause that our revolutionary movement must accomplish." He mentioned these words in an article he wrote in June 1932.

Twenty-two years before publishing this article, he published an article "The Aborigines of Taiwan" in the "Toyo Keizai Shinpo." The article described the "aboriginal" riots at that time. He took a completely different position from the ordinary Japanese who were educated by imperialism at that time.

Katayama Sen opposed the oppression of the Korean people very early on. He said: "It is precisely because the warlords are rampant in Korea and abuse the Korean people that Japan has become the most dishonorable country and Japanese people abroad have become the most hated and rejected people. Now, Japan is becoming the Prussia of the East, a militarist and outrageous country; the whole world is preparing to attack it, and Japan is becoming the second Germany." ("War and Socialism")

In the struggle against the "Prussia of the Far East—the enemy of mankind and peace," he always repeatedly quoted Engels's saying that it is impossible to liberate oneself while oppressing other nations to educate us. Our Japanese Communist Party has long been fighting in accordance with this teaching of Katayama Sen.

Since its establishment, our Party has clearly established the goal of overthrowing the Tenno system. The Tenno system is the guarantee for the Japanese imperialists to oppress the Korean people and the Chinese people in Taiwan under its rule. The reason why the Japanese Communist Party has received the heartfelt support of the Korean people and the Chinese people is precisely because the Japanese Communist Party has raised the banner of overthrowing the Tenno system.

In order to widely publicize the idea that the Japanese people should not oppress other nations, the Japanese Communist Party, while subjected to inhumane suppression, led the struggles to commemorate the National Humiliation Day of the Occupation of Taiwan on June 19 and the Anniversary of the Annexation of Korea on August 29. The reason why the Japanese Communist Party was able to lead these struggles was also because it was inspired by the "League Against Imperialism and Support for National Independence" led by Katayama Sen and others.

In his later years, Katayama Sen said: "I am working as a member of the Communist International, the leading organization of the world revolutionary movement, and I am especially working with the Japanese revolution as my lifelong wish. Of course, my work is not limited to the Japanese revolutionary movement. I have deep sympathy for the revolutions in the Eastern countries and the colonial revolutionary movements, and I have enthusiastically participated in these movements. Regarding the autonomous and independent movement of black people in North America, the program of this movement (the resolution on the black people's issue in the United States) is one of the few resolutions made by the Communist International for him. I once served as the chairman of the American Bureau, and since then, I have been conducting leadership work to complete this task, and for more than ten years I have been doing my best for black people."

The "American Bureau" period written in the article was around 1920, when he participated in the party-building work of the Communist Parties of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. When the American Communist Party was established, no one dared to advocate giving black workers the same treatment as white people, but Katayama Sen was the first to propose this proposition (according to Yoshitaro Hirano, "People in the Anti-War Movement"). The black people's issue is the dark side of "democratic" America. The Sixth Congress of the Communist International made a correct conclusion on the black people's issue in 1928. Katayama Sen's efforts played a great role in making this resolution.

At this congress, Katayama Sen also strongly advocated improving the relationship between the parties of imperialist countries and the fraternal parties of colonial countries.

Many people know that Katayama Sen made important contributions to the development of the Chinese revolution and the liberation movement of Korea and other oppressed nations. This can be proved from his speeches at various meetings of the Communist International.

Katayama Sen is a true proletarian internationalist fighter and a fighter for the liberation of oppressed nations of whom the Japanese nation can be proud. It can be said that the reason why we Communists have been able to hold high the banner of internationalism and national liberation is the result of being influenced by Katayama Sen's exemplary deeds.

Conclusion

The above is only a brief description of Katayama Sen's deeds. The more detailed we understand and study the path he has traveled and the works he has left us, the more we can deeply feel that he was a great revolutionary and a great leader of the people. He exemplified the development of the thoughts and actions of the Japanese working class for half a century and correctly pointed out the path of liberation that the working class, as the leader of the entire people, should take in the future.

However, for the Japanese ruling class, Katayama Sen is the most terrible enemy. Therefore, they are afraid that Katayama Sen's great achievements and the name of Katayama Sen will be recorded in the history of Japan. They attempted to erase Katayama Sen from history and tried their best to prevent the people from knowing his greatness. Social democrats also nitpick or try to belittle Katayama Sen's achievements in the Japanese social movement as much as possible. These practices of theirs have also had some impact on some of our communists more or less. In response to the vicious methods adopted by the ruling class against Katayama Sen, we need to launch a struggle; and strive to make Katayama Sen achieve a position in history commensurate with his contributions. We must widely publicize his achievements to the worker masses and other working people and call on everyone to work hard to learn from him.

Katayama Sen's thoughts and career are still alive today, and he is inspiring us and giving us courage and confidence.

Let us swear when commemorating the centenary of Katayama Sen's birth:

We must inherit his unfinished revolutionary cause and further strengthen the Communist Party he founded with the same enthusiasm and courage as him, with the same staunch and unyielding spirit, and with the same close ties to the worker masses; and complete the great cause of fighting for peace, independence, democracy and social progress that he left us!

专栏：

    日本人民的伟大领袖片山潜
    日本共产党中央委员会主席　野坂参三
    片山潜的名字不仅和日本的民主运动及革命运动紧密地联系在一起，而且和世界和平运动及共产主义运动紧密地联系在一起。他是一位出身于日本工人阶级的最伟大的、具有世界影响的革命家。日本工人阶级因为有这样一位伟大的前辈而感到自豪。
    目前，广大的日本人民都在筹备纪念片山潜诞生一百周年的活动（12月3日）。同时，为了纪念片山潜诞生一百周年，苏联、中国、法国、英国、捷克斯洛伐克、意大利、蒙古以及其他各国工人运动的领袖，也写了许多文章介绍他的生平事迹。这些事实可以证明，他是日本人民杰出的领袖和具有世界影响的革命家。
    二十六年前，他因病在莫斯科逝世。但是，当我们今天追溯目前正在进行着的我国工人、农民和其他劳动人民的运动的发生和发展的过程，追溯和平运动、国际团结的运动和我们共产党的运动的发生和发展的过程的时候，我们总会看到，这些运动是同片山潜分不开的。在日本，最初把组织方法和斗争方法教给工人的就是他。
    现在，日本的和平运动有了很大的发展，加强国际团结的运动也正在蓬勃地展开。大家都知道，这些运动的最初的基础，是片山潜在日俄战争前后，通过他在国内外的一系列活动建立起来的。而且，他的领导对这些运动后来的发展，在某些情况下确实有着决定性的影响。所以，他的事业并没有因为他的逝世而中断，他的事业今天仍然生气勃勃地在成长和发展。
    片山潜的足迹遍于全世界。他的著作从论述马克思列宁主义的精华直到评论戏剧，涉及的范围非常广泛。他的业绩可以归纳为以下五点：
    第一，他是日本工人运动最早的组织者和领导者；
    第二，他是日本最早的社会主义思想的宣传家和社会主义运动的组织者；
    第三，他是日本共产党的创始人和领袖；
    第四，他是反对战争、争取和平的坚贞不屈的战士；
    第五，他是卓越的无产阶级国际主义者和民族解放运动的支持者。一、日本工人运动最早的组织者和领导者
    1868年，打击了日本封建制度的日本新的统治者，为了促进资本主义的发展，采用了欧美的先进制度。结果，产业革命，尤其是纺织和交通方面的产业革命，取得了迅速的发展。与此同时，现代的工人阶级也成长起来。劳资之间的新的阶级矛盾也随着产生并逐渐尖锐。
    就是在这样一个动荡的时期，片山潜作为农民的儿子诞生了。他半工半读地度过了青年时期。后来又到美国去劳动和学习，在那里观察了先进的美国资本主义社会和劳工运动、社会主义运动。他怀着为解决社会问题而贡献出自己的一生的决心回到了日本。从那时开始直到他逝世的半个世纪中间，他抱着坚决的意志，把自己的一生献给了人类的解放事业。
    片山潜回日本后立即深入到工人群众中去，积极地参加了当时国内已在筹备当中的工会的组织工作。
    1897年12月1日是日本劳工运动历史上值得纪念的日子。这一天，建立了日本最早的、具有近代组织内容的五金工人的“铁工组合”；并发行了日本最早的工人杂志“劳动世界”。片山潜担任了工会的书记和杂志的总编辑。这两方面的工作，对于以后的工人斗争，起了很大的指导作用。
    为了建立一个以工人中最先进的金属机械工人为中心的长期性的组织，片山潜贡献了很大的力量。在他开始进行活动以前，他亲身投入了工人的斗争，例如矿工、丝绸女工、人力车夫等群众斗争。但这些斗争往往是一时的或自发性的，有些则带有对自由民权运动起辅助作用的性质。经过片山潜和其他领导人的艰苦工作，提高了工人群众的觉悟，为改善自己的生活条件团结起来，组织了自己的工会。
    在中日战争（1894—1895）以后工业飞跃发展的年代，特别是大企业发展的年代里，片山潜和新时代的必然的推动力量——工人有了直接的接触，并抛弃了改良主义的立场，迈出了走向马克思主义和共产主义的第一步。
    片山潜一方面组织和领导处在资本主义时期以前的残酷的劳动条件下的工人，为维护自己的生活和权利而进行斗争；另一方面，为了用法律来保障斗争的成果，他又倡议制订工厂法和工人保护法等法律，并积极地为实现这个目的而进行了活动。由于他的努力，后来日本制定了保护工人的法律，虽然当时这种法律还是初步的。
    日俄战争（1904—1905）后，日本面临了产业发展的新时期，日本工人受到第一次俄国革命的影响，斗争更加剧烈了，有时甚至发生暴动。他虽然不是暴动的支持者，但是他认为没有团结自由和罢工自由的日本工人采取这种行为也是不得已的。他主张维护工人，争取团结和罢工的自由，要求废除镇压法规——治安警察法。
    他把这些主张带到工人群众中去，并在全国各地展开了宣传工作。1910年天皇制政府捏造所谓暗杀天皇的“阴谋案件”，逮捕了幸德秋水等二十四名无政府主义者和社会主义者，并把其中十二人送上了断头台。这时片山潜就表现了他的优良品质。他没有为迫害所屈服，以他为中心的“马克思主义的社会主义团体，继续在工人中间进行了沉着的宣传活动。虽然我们只举行了演讲会，但是，我们在演讲会用社会主义的观点说明了关于社会和政治的事实和事件。”（片山潜著：“日本的劳工运动”）
    1911年年底，震撼日本的东京市内电车公司六千名职工的罢工连续进行了四天，终于获得了胜利。这次大规模斗争的领导者就是片山潜。由于这次罢工，他遭到逮捕并被投进了监狱。出狱后，反动派一直没有放松对他的迫害。为了寻求自由，他被迫远走美国。此后，到他逝世为止，就一直没有能够重新踏上他所热爱的祖国的土地。
    从以上叙述中可以看出，片山潜是日本最早组织工人进行斗争和启发他们的阶级觉悟的先觉者。同时，在这些实践中，片山潜本人的思想也得到了发展。他的才能不断成长，终于成为一个卓越的群众的政治家。
    不管在多么困难的情况下，片山潜都始终不渝地坚持工人阶级的立场。他之所以能够这样，原因之一就是他无论是在日本或是在美国，不仅都是自觉地按照一个工人的方式生活；而且在他成为劳工运动的领袖以后，还经常与工人群众同甘共苦，尽量与工人们保持密切的联系。与他同时代的一些有名的领导人，如幸德秋水、西川光次郎、安部矶雄、堺枯川等人，后来有的成为无政府主义者，有的成为改良主义者和社会民主主义者，离开了革命的道路。唯有片山潜走上了真正革命的、科学社会主义的正确道路，其中重要原因就是他不断地密切同群众的联系。
    二、最早的社会主义的宣传家和组织者
    片山潜在第一次留学美国的时候，就已经被称为社会主义者了。他受德国社会民主党、特别是拉萨尔的言论的影响很深。但当时他的思想中还参杂有相当多的社会改良主义思想。
    在他推动作为工人自身运动的工会运动并要求以法律来保障提高工人阶级地位时，议会和普通选举渐渐很自然地成为他的斗争目标。1899年10月他开始组织“促成普选同盟”。从此，促进普选便成为他在日本期间的重要斗争。
    但是，片山潜的思想随着工人阶级斗争的发展也有了发展。1898年10月，他和幸德秋水以及其他同志一起组织了社会主义研究会。正像他自己所写的那样，这个研究会曾经研究各种社会主义学说，“经过多次认真的讨论之后，得出了一个结论，这就是确信唯有马克思主义才是我们应该采取和实行的真正的理论。”这时他已第一次接受了马克思主义。1900年1月，研究会改名
  “社会主义协会”。这个协会成为日本社会主义力量在第二国际的代表团体和宣传社会主义的团体。
    普选和社会主义结合在一起，就势必要求进行阶级的政治运动。片山潜曾经这样说：“1901年3月在大宫市召开的日本铁路工会年会上通过一项决议，决议声言社会主义才是从根本上解决劳动问题的唯一途径，并指示执行委员会参加争取普选权的运动。……这时候，日本铁路工会的决议所表明的明确的社会主义立场，以及这个时代的其他许多特征，使我们确信，我们工人阶级对政治运动已经有了相当的准备。因此……我们建立了社会民主党这样一个社会主义政党。”
    这个政党还不是马克思主义的政党。特别是在立宪主义这一点上是存在着问题的。但是，他们的目的就是为了维护劳动人民的目前利益以及在争取普选的斗争中利用议会这个讲坛。所以这个运动在当时来说，确是符合于群众愿望的正确路线。这个政党是日本最早的要求以工人阶级为基础的政党。
    日本社会民主党成立的第一天，就遭到了政府的禁止。但是，它的建党宣言却被广泛地传播开去。社会民主党对社会主义运动的发展起了促进作用；在劳动群众中引起了反响；同时也暴露了天皇制度的反动实质。实际上自从社会民主党遭到禁止，直到日俄战争爆发，日本社会民主党人广泛地宣传了社会主义。片山潜以“劳动世界”为中心进行活动，并到全国各地去作旅行宣传。
    1903年片山潜发表了“我的社会主义”一书。他在这本书的“例言”中写道：这本书是“对今天的社会，即对腐败的、黄金万能的、资本家横行霸道的社会的控诉。”
    他对社会革命的观念已经相当明确。他指出，作为社会发展的次序，资本主义制度即将灭亡。“今天，随着产业的发达，资本家的势力将会更加强大。他们将用过去的力量和现在所有的力量来抗拒社会发展的势力，与进步的势力发生冲突。从而不得不相信社会必将发生革命。”那就是资本家和工人争夺社会统治权，……
  “因此，我们可以断言，社会革命的中心问题，就是工人要掌握政权而资本家对此加以抗拒。”片山潜这样大胆地宣传了社会主义思想，他的功绩是我们不能忘怀的。
    1904年8月，日俄战争期间，在阿姆斯特丹召开第二国际大会的时候，片山潜作为日本的代表出席了这次大会。在这次大会上，他站在正统马克思派的立场上同当时的修正主义进行了斗争。1907年片山潜曾经说：“我是以社会党国际（第二国际）为准则进行运动的。”从这里可以看出，在当时的情况下，他已经明确地站在国际主义的立场上。这一点是必须予以强调说明的。
    日俄战争后，劳工运动和社会主义运动由于受到俄国革命的影响，比中日战争后更加活跃。由于工业的发展、物价高涨和失业人数的增加，在足尾铜矿和别子铜矿掀起了空前剧烈的斗争。
    战争期间为反对战争而勇敢地进行了斗争的社会主义者，在1906年2月，一致团结起来建立了日本社会党，希望能够对新时代的运动作出贡献。不消说，片山潜是积极参加了的。但是到了1907年，日本社会党围绕着“采取议会政策，还是直接行动”的问题展开了争论。主张采取直接行动的代表是幸德秋水，主张采取议会政策的代表是片山潜。政府乘这次内部分裂的机会，下令禁止社会党，并进一步加强了残酷的镇压。
    从这时起到1917年，是“日本社会主义运动的黑暗时代”。片山潜指出其原因如下：
    社会主义者在日俄战争后没有能在工人阶级中间树立起巨大的影响。“党……遭到禁止时，只剩下极少数社会主义知识分子和无政府工团主义分子。也就是说，好像有二个互相敌对的团长，而二个团长都没有带领军队。”这样，运动必将停滞不前。
    “在写理论文章和发表议论方面，我不是知识分子的对手。但是我可以为工人阶级写作，同工人阶级讲话，能够说明他们的思想和活动。”
    事实上，片山潜在1907年以后通过“社会新闻”，以当时所面临的问题为中心，不断向工人们进行生动的社会主义宣传。在镇压行动极端残酷的年代里，他仍然到各地去进行宣传演讲。他的言行是一个真正的革命的社会主义者所应采取的态度。
    今天日本共产党继承了片山潜在活动中所采取的态度和理论，并且正在全力以赴地，也必须是全力以赴地予以发展。
    三、日本共产党的创始人和领袖
    片山潜对我们日本共产党的创立起了重大的作用。
    1917年俄国的十月革命为世界历史开辟了一个新的时代。日本的先进分子拥护这个革命。日本工人秘密寄给年青的苏维埃国家的贺信中这样写着：
    “我们的关心和注意都集中在俄国革命的进展上。我们以深切的同情注视着俄国无产阶级的前进。它在日本群众心目中留下了不可磨灭的印象。”
    当时正在美国的片山潜，毫不犹豫地立即对俄国革命的胜利表示自己拥护的立场。这对他来说是很自然的事情。因为1904年他就曾在阿姆斯特丹表示：“工人都是同胞，应该团结一致，制止战争。”而且，当第二国际随着第一次世界大战的爆发，宣布支持战争的时候，片山潜是支持齐美尔瓦尔得、昆塔尔等会议的决议和列宁的立场的。
    片山潜一方面支持俄国革命；同时，在美国积极地参加了建立领导这种革命的新型政党——列宁主义的党的工作，并开始准备在日本也建立同样的政党。
    1920年片山潜在美国读了列宁的“国家与革命”，并翻译了这本书。后来他说“读了‘国家与革命’，弄清楚了从资本主义向社会主义过渡的日程。”从这里可以看出，他已经掌握了建立共产党的理论基础。当时，社会民主主义倾向和无政府工团主义倾向，在日本工人运动中产生了深刻的影响；所以，片山潜的这种理论工作，对共产党的建设来说有着巨大的意义。
    另一方面，由于十月革命的影响，日本工人中间也发生了巨大的变化。这种变化的实际例证就是1918年8月的“米骚动”。这是明治维新以后历来发生的群众行动中的规模最大的一次。在富山县的一个渔村发生的袭击米店的事件，扩大到全国各地，最后终于发展成为一个有一千万人以上参加的巨大运动。大战后民主运动和社会主义运动的发展，都是为这次“米骚动”引起的。但是，这次有历史意义的群众行动，由于缺乏革命的纲领和领导，终于遭到政府的血腥镇压。片山潜对这个事件这样写道：
    “日本的社会主义者虽然以如此热烈的心情听到俄国十月革命的消息；但是，他们并不准备积极地参加这个运动，也不打算领导群众走向正确的方向。根本原因就在他们同工人阶级毫无联系，而且也不想去同工人阶级取得联系。他们仅仅满足于背诵马克思主义的教条。”
    由于这种情况，在日本国内建立共产党的活动便没有能够立即收到实际的效果。因此要促进党的建设工作，就很需要国外的援助。片山潜主动地承担了这个任务。他第一个提出必须在日本组织共产党。1920年片山潜在墨西哥的时候，发表了“日本和日益迫近的社会主义革命”一文。他在文章的结论部分写道：
    “在此，我想特别强调，为了战胜日本帝国主义，世界革命军队对日本无产阶级的支持是无条件地需要的。”
    在这篇文章中，他第一次明确指出，必须在日本建立共产党；指出日本共产党必须作为全世界无产阶级革命力量的一部分来进行组织。所以1922年7月15日诞生的日本共产党，实际上是在二年以前就已由片山潜从思想上到组织上作了充分的准备。
    但是，片山潜不仅为日本共产党奠定了基础。1921年12月，他根据共产国际的指示，为了组织远东劳动者大会，从墨西哥到了苏联。在1922年1月召开的远东劳动者大会上，他和日本派去的代表一起作出了建立日本共产党的决定。日本共产党的建立，使日本人民的解放运动开始跨进了新的时代。
    片山潜的领导对日本共产党后来的发展有着很大的影响。日本共产党走过的道路决不是平坦的道路。它不断地同“左”倾和右倾机会主义进行了毫不妥协的斗争。1923年6月的逮捕和同年9月发生震灾时的白色恐怖等情况，都引起党内的不坚定分子很大的动摇。他们终于在1924年3月作出了暂时解散日本共产党的决议。虽然片山潜当时在国外，但他推翻了这个决议。直到1926年12月召开重新建党大会，片山潜从未中断过对党的领导工作。
    重新建立起来的党虽然清除了山川等取消派的理论；但是，又产生了“左”倾宗派主义的“福本主义”和否定无产阶级群众政党的倾向。这种指导理论就使日本的党在群众中越来越加孤立。1927年制定的党的纲领指出：“如果说主张在左翼工会运动中取消党的（右倾）方针是错误的、是致命性的，那么，使党在无产阶级的群众组织中陷于孤立的（极“左”的）方针也同样是错误的。”
    在得出这个正确结论的过程中，片山潜起了重要的作用。
    在这以前，由于党内存在着“左”右两种取消主义的倾向，片山潜的领导往往受到轻视。到1928年以后，片山潜的文章才经常在党的机关刊物上发挥指导作用。我们尤其不能忘记的是，在加强党的队伍，同机会主义、叛徒、间谍、挑衅分子进行不调和的斗争中，他总是站在最前列，始终一贯地为日本共产党在理论上和组织上的成长而进行了斗争。
    四、反对战争、维护和平的战士
    片山潜当时规定日本共产党的目标是打倒日本军国主义。大家知道，他是坚决反对战争，维护和平的战士。但当他在成为一个共产主义者之前，就已经是一个反对战争、维护和平的勇敢的战士了。早在1901年，在成立的当天就遭到禁止的社会民主党的宣言中，有以下一段话：
    “其次，民主主义所极力反对的就是军国主义。今天世界上的各个强国都在忙于扩充军备，都想凭借实力来决定问题的是非曲直。这不仅是人类的敌人，而且严重地妨碍了民主主义的发展。列强加强军备的目的，就是为了强迫弱小国家开放市场，扩大本国商品的销路；以及防止国内民主主义的发展……。”在进行实际运动的纲领中还提到“裁减军备”的问题。社会民主党的宣言虽然不是片山潜起草的，但是不能否认，这个宣言鲜明地反映了他的思想。
    日俄战争中，在1904年，阿姆斯特丹举行的第二国际大会上，片山潜同普列汉诺夫握手，表示工人阶级之间毫无怨恨和憎恶，并表示决心相互携起手来为阻止战争而斗争。这次大会通过一项反对日俄战争的决议。其中有一段写道：“依靠各国社会党的力量，想尽一切办法来反对把这个战争扩大和长期继续下去。”后来，片山潜忠实地、全力以赴地贯彻执行了这个决议。
    十月革命后，对战争的问题需要采取与过去不同的态度。反动的帝国主义者对人类历史上最初的无产阶级国家发动的侵略战争，是非正义的战争；无产阶级国家为反对这种侵略而进行的战争是正义的；所以，世界工人阶级必须竭尽全力来支援这个正义的战争。
    片山潜作为一个共产主义者，反对对世界上第一个社会主义国家发动侵略战争，并站到这个斗争的最前列进行了斗争。这就是说，十月革命后刚诞生的苏维埃国家，很快受到了帝国主义国家的干涉和战争的威胁。日本帝国主义在1918年8月“米骚动”事件的前几天作出了出兵西伯利亚的决定，企图扼杀十月革命，实际占领贝加尔湖以东地区。这时片山潜率先为反对出兵西伯利亚而进行了斗争。1922年他虽然已经年老体弱，仍然亲自去到西伯利亚。当时散发给日本士兵的传单就是以他的名义印发的。
    例如片山潜在题为“日本的老革命家对西伯利亚日本士兵的衷心劝告”中，强烈呼吁：“作为一个爱护自己的兄弟、即爱护日本的工人和农民甚于自己的生命的日本人，诚恳地劝告各位：各位应该立即撤出西伯利亚，一定回到自己的家乡。”片山潜的这些活动，是使日本军队的入侵归于失败的原因之一。
    正因为日本共产党早在建党以前就受到了片山潜的思想领导，所以它能够在国内动员广大国民参加“反对出兵西伯利亚的斗争”和“营救饥饿的俄国”等运动；在挫败日本帝国主义的野心方面有所贡献。这样，就使日本共产党当时能够在某种程度上尽到了它的最重要的国际义务。
    1931年9月，日本帝国主义发动军事行动，侵占了中国的东北，从而建立起进攻苏联的据点。当时片山潜积极领导了反对侵略战争的斗争。他在莫斯科建立了国际反战委员会，并努力筹备世界反战大会。1932年8月阿姆斯特丹反战大会的召开，在很大程度上应归功于片山潜的努力。
    当时已经七十四岁的片山潜出席了这次大会。他一面回忆了二十八年前日俄战争时期召开的世界大会；一面向大会宣告，日本国内有一种势力不顾镇压，正在为反对当时日本帝国主义所发动的侵略战争而斗争，希望全世界都予以支持，并要求大会给中国革命以援助。这使参加大会的人受到很大的感动。如果说在全世界范围内组织反对以日本帝国主义为首的好战主义分子而进行的斗争、和建立反战反法西斯统一战线的工作，是从这次会议开始的，也不能算是过分。
    就日本国内来说，共产党曾经为反对日本军国主义对中国发动侵略战争而进行了斗争，并且在军队内部组织了反战活动。党为此受到了世界兄弟党的赞扬。在这个斗争中曾经出现了许多值得我们自豪的英雄。而为我们树立了这种活动的光辉榜样的就是片山潜。我们必须在今天和今后发扬这个传统。五、国际主义者和民族解放运动的支持者关于片山潜，我曾经这样写过：
    “印象特别深的一点，就是他对被压迫民族抱有很深的同情，对于他们身受的不平等待遇，总是表示非常愤慨，并为他们的解放作出自己最大的努力。例如，在美国的时候，他曾经是黑人亲密的朋友。……所以，他到莫斯科以后，从美国来莫斯科访问的黑人总要来会晤片山潜，求得他的援助和意见。他对从朝鲜和中国来莫斯科的共产党员和学生，也像对待日本人一样予以热情的接待和亲切的照顾。……
    所以，据说在他去世后，黑人、中国和朝鲜的老同志访问莫斯科的时候，从来不会忘记去拜谒片山潜的陵墓。”（“前卫”1958年11月号）
    片山潜年青的时候到了美国，切身体会到种族歧视的痛苦。片山潜很早就反对种族歧视。1902年10月，社会主义者协会曾经通过决议，准备提出反对种族歧视的问题，建议其后不久召开的世界社会党大会（阿姆斯特丹大会）讨论这个问题。
    在阿姆斯特丹大会上强调工人皆同胞的片山潜，后来曾经这样说：
    “正如列宁提交共产国际第二次大会的殖民地纲领所指出的，争取弱小民族的自由和解放，是我们无产阶级革命运动的重要任务。诸位，使北海道的虾夷和台湾的土著取得自由和解放，是我们革命运动所必须完成的事业。”这段话是他在1932年6月所写的文章中提到的。
    在发表这篇文章的二十二年以前，他就在“东洋经济新报”上发表过“台湾的土著”一文。文章叙述了当时“土著”的暴动。他采取了和当时受到帝国主义教育的普通日本人完全不同的立场。
    片山潜很早就反对对朝鲜人民的压迫。他说：“正是由于军阀在朝鲜横行霸道、虐待朝鲜人民，所以才使日本成为最不光荣的国家，使国外的日本人成为最被憎恨、最受排斥的民族。现在，日本正在变成东方的普鲁士、变成军国主义的大逆不道的国家；全世界都在准备群起而攻之，日本正在变成第二个德国。”（“战争与社会主义”）
    他在同“远东的普鲁士——人类与和平的敌人”进行斗争当中，总是反复地引用恩格斯所说的，不可能在压迫其他民族的同时解放自己这句话来教育我们。我们日本共产党很早就是遵循着片山潜的这种教导而进行斗争的。
    我党自从成立以来就明确地树立了打倒天皇制的目标。天皇制是日本帝国主义者压迫在它统治下的朝鲜民族和台湾的中国人民的保障。日本共产党所以受到朝鲜人民和中国人民的衷心的支持，也正是因为日本共产党举起了打倒天皇制的旗帜的缘故。
    日本共产党为了广泛宣传日本人民不应该压迫其他民族的思想，曾经在遭受到灭绝人性的镇压的情况下，领导了纪念6月19日台湾被占领的国耻纪念日和8月29日朝鲜被并吞的纪念日等的斗争。日本共产党之所以能够领导这些斗争也是因为受到了片山潜等人所领导的
  “反对帝国主义支持民族独立同盟”的鼓舞。
    片山潜晚年的时候曾经说：“我是作为世界革命运动的领导机构共产国际的一个成员在工作的，特别是把日本的革命当作自己终生的愿望在进行工作的。当然，我的工作不只限于日本的革命运动。我对东方各国的革命和殖民地的革命运动都抱有很深的同情，并热烈地参加了这些运动。关于北美洲黑人的自治独立运动，这个运动的纲领（关于合众国黑人问题的决议）就是共产国际为他所作的屈指可数的决议之一。我曾经担任美洲局的委员长，从那时起，就为了完成这一任务而进行了领导工作，十多年来我一直为黑人而竭尽全力。”
    文中所写的“美国局”时期，乃是1920年前后的事情，当时他参加了美国、加拿大和墨西哥等国共产党的建党工作。美国共产党成立的时候，还没有人敢于提倡给黑人工人以同白人同等的待遇问题，而是片山潜首先提出了这个主张（据平野义太郎著“反战运动的人们”）。黑人问题是“民主”的美国黑暗的一面，1928年共产国际第六次大会关于黑人问题作出了正确的结论，在作出这个决议的过程中，片山潜的努力起了很大的作用。
    在这次大会上，片山潜还极力主张改善帝国主义国家的党和殖民地国家的兄弟党之间的关系。
    许多人都知道，片山潜对中国革命的发展和朝鲜以及其他被压迫民族的解放运动都作出了重要的贡献。这可以从他在共产国际各种会议上的发言中得到证明。
    片山潜是日本民族值得自豪的真正的无产阶级国际主义战士和被压迫民族争取解放的战士。迄今为止，我们共产党能够一直高举国际主义和民族解放的旗帜，可以说都是因为受到片山潜的这种模范事迹的影响的结果。
    结束语
    以上只是叙述了片山潜的事迹的概略。我们越是详尽地了解和研究他所走过的道路和他留给我们的著作，就越能使我们深切地感到他是伟大的革命家和人民的伟大领袖。他以身作则地代表了半个世纪的日本工人阶级的思想和行动的发展，并正确地指出了工人阶级作为全体人民的领导人今后所应走的解放的道路。
  但是，对日本统治阶级来说，片山潜是一个最可怕的敌人。因此，他们唯恐片山潜的丰功伟绩和片山潜的名字被载入日本的史册。他们企图从历史上一笔抹煞片山潜，竭力阻止人民知道他的伟大。社会民主主义者也对片山潜在日本社会运动中的功绩吹毛求疵，或尽量加以贬低。他们的这些作法，对我们某些共产主义者也或多或少地产生了一些影响。针对统治阶级对片山潜所采取的恶毒手法，我们有必要展开斗争；努力使片山潜在历史上取得与他的贡献相称的地位。我们要向工人群众及其他劳动人民广泛地宣传他的功绩，并号召大家努力向他学习。
    片山潜的思想和事业今天仍然活着，他在鼓舞着我们，并且给了我们以勇气和信心。
    让我们在纪念片山潜诞生一百周年的时候来宣誓：
    我们一定继承他未完成的革命事业，并以与他同样的热情和勇气、与他同样坚贞不屈的精神、与他同样地密切联系工人群众，来进一步加强他所建立的共产党；完成他遗留给我们的争取和平、独立、民主和社会进步的伟大事业！（附图片）
