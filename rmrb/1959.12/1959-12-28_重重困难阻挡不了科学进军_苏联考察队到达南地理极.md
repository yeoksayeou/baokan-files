Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 27th. The sledge-tractor train of the Soviet Fourth Antarctic Expedition reached the South Geographic Pole at 12:15 Moscow time on the 26th. "Pravda" published today a telegram sent back by the expedition leader, Dralkin, describing the journey.

The expedition team, consisting of sixteen people, set off from "Mirny Station" on September 27th and proceeded from "Komsomolskaya Station" to "Vostok Station" on November 6th. The latter part of the journey was particularly difficult. The soft snow made the train move very slowly, and sometimes the entire vehicle was buried in the snow, so the vehicles had to be dragged out of the snow one by one. The temperature along the way was minus fifty degrees Celsius.

On December 8th, the team set off again from "Vostok Station." This part of the road had never been traveled by Soviet scientists before. In the first few days, the train traveled on relatively flat, soft snow. As the team entered the interior of Antarctica, the terrain changed: sometimes it was traveling on flat ground, sometimes it had to slide down, and sometimes it had to climb up. When the train entered the "snow wave" (wavy snow layer) zone, it shook violently like a sea vessel encountering a storm. Therefore, before approaching the "snow wave" zone, the expedition members had to tie everything on the vehicle tightly.

The train encountered a very flat snowfield 125 kilometers from the pole, as if it had not been affected by wind or other natural forces at all. However, this was just an illusion. As soon as you stepped out of the vehicle, your legs immediately sank deep into the snow. Subsequently, the train began to encounter "snow waves" again.

It took eighteen days to travel from "Vostok Station" to the pole. Scientific work was carried out every two hundred kilometers. One of the main tasks was to use seismic measurements to understand the strength of the ice layer.

These investigations, which have never been carried out in the central part of Antarctica, are a valuable contribution to science.

The Fourth Antarctic Expedition has traveled for a total of ninety days since its departure.

### 重重困难阻挡不了科学进军  苏联考察队到达南地理极

　　重重困难阻挡不了科学进军
    苏联考察队到达南地理极
    新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联第四南极考察队的雪撬——牵引车队，已经在26日莫斯科时间十二时十五分到达南地理极。“真理报”今天刊载了考察队队长德拉尔金发回的电报，他叙述了旅途的情况。
    9月27日，由十六人组成的考察队从“和平村”出发，11月6日从“共青团”站前往“东方”站。后一段路程特别艰巨难行，松软的雪使车队行走得非常缓慢，有时甚至整个车身都陷入雪堆之中，因此不得不将车辆一个接一个地从雪堆中拖出来。沿途的气温是零下五十度。
    12月8日，车队又从“东方”站出发，这一段路在苏联的科学人员到达以前是从来没有人到过的。最初几天，车队在比较平坦的松软雪地上行进。车队进入南极的腹地，地形就有了变化：有时是在平地上行进，有时要往下滑行，有时又要向上攀登。当车队进入“雪波”（波状的雪层）地带时，就像海轮遇上风暴一般，震荡得非常厉害，因此，考察人员在接近“雪波”地带前，就得将车辆上的全部东西绑得紧紧地。
    车队在离极点一百二十五公里的地方，遇到了非常平坦的雪野，仿佛这儿丝毫没有受到风或其它自然力量的影响。但是，这只是假象，只要你一出车辆，腿就立即深深地陷入雪中；随后，车队又开始遇到“雪波”。
    从“东方”站到极点共行走了十八天。每经过二百公里，工作人员就停下来进行科学工作。其中主要的一项是用地震测量法了解冰层的强力。
    这些在南极中心地带从未进行过的考察工作，对科学是很珍贵的贡献。
    第四南极考察队从出发到现在共走了九十天。
