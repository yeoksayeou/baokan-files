　　Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today, calling on the Japanese people to wage a struggle not only against the Kishi Nobusuke government but also against US imperialism, opposing the conclusion of a US-Japan military alliance.

    The editorial pointed out that US imperialism is attempting to strengthen its control over Japan by establishing a US-Japan military alliance through revising the "Security Treaty." The US's actions, which run counter to the trend of peaceful coexistence and the easing of the international situation, are aimed at maintaining the "Cold War."

    The editorial emphasized that in the current struggle to prevent revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty," the most important thing is to recognize the enemy and organize the masses to launch large-scale struggles. Therefore, the Japanese people must currently wage strong protest struggles not only against the Kishi Nobusuke government but also against the US government, expressing the Japanese people's firm will to fight for peace and independence.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, Tokyo: Japanese cultural organizations have been holding meetings and issuing statements, expressing their opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's conclusion of a new "Security Treaty" with the United States.

    The Liaison Committee of the "Security Treaty Criticism Association," an organization of Japanese cultural figures, decided at an expanded meeting today that cultural figures will hold a "silent demonstration" on January 11 to express their opposition to Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's trip to the United States to sign the new "Security Treaty."

    The expanded meeting also decided that the "Security Treaty Criticism Association" will jointly launch a campaign with the "Security Treaty Problem Research Society" to write letters to US political and cultural leaders, explaining the dangers of the revised "Security Treaty."

    The expanded meeting also decided that representatives of the Criticism Association will meet with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the head of the "Punishment Committee" to protest the attempt to "punish" Inejiro Asanuma and three other Socialist Party members.

    The Children's Literature Association held a lecture meeting in Tokyo today, opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    The Japan Congress of Journalists issued a statement today, demanding the immediate cancellation of the plan to sign a new US-Japan "Security Treaty." The statement stated that if the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its attitude towards signing the new "Security Treaty," Japanese journalists are determined to take all possible measures to work with the Japanese people to prevent the signing of this US-Japan military alliance treaty.

    Prior to this, the "Security Treaty" Problem Historians' Forum had issued a statement opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 24th: The "Red Star" published a commentary today on Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's upcoming trip to the United States to sign a new US-Japan "Security Treaty," saying that the new US-Japan military treaty will be a treaty for the further militarization of Japan. After the treaty is signed, it will turn Japan into a US atomic base, and Japan will automatically join the US side in the event of a military conflict in the Far East. Its danger is obvious.

    The commentary pointed out that the signing of the new US-Japan military treaty will be the most shameful page written by the Japanese ruling group in the post-war history of Japan.

    The commentary talked about the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and exposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's plot to expand its armed forces with the support of the United States. The commentary said that Japan's army has now increased to 220,000, and the army, navy, and air force are all expanding. In order to accelerate militarization, the Japanese ruling group is also purchasing various new weapons from the United States. The Kishi Nobusuke government's actions have aroused great anger among the Japanese people. In Japan, anyone with a clear head can see the danger of the US and Japan signing a new military treaty.

    The commentary said that the Japanese people suffered tremendous sacrifices in World War II, but the Japanese ruling group does not want to learn from the past events. They continue to stubbornly implement the policy that once led Japan to ruin, and attempt to continue to arm Japan.

    The commentary concluded that Japan should abandon its alliance with the United States and abandon dangerous war preparations. Only the path of independence and neutrality is in the interests of the Japanese people. Tokyo civil servants also joined the vigorous national struggle against the Kishi government's traitorous conspiracy. Here are 50,000 Tokyo civil servants gathering to protest the US-Japan revision of the "Security Treaty."

　　日共“赤旗报”向日本人民发出号召
    展开斗争反对日美缔结军事同盟
    苏联“红星报”指出日本应当放弃危险的备战活动
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本人民不仅对岸信介政府，同时要对美帝国主义展开斗争，反对缔结日美军事同盟。
    社论指出，美帝国主义企图通过修改“安全条约”建立日美军事同盟，加强对日本的控制。美国这种同和平共处和国际局势走向缓和的趋势背道而驰的做法的目的，在于坚持“冷战”。
    社论强调指出，在目前阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”的斗争中，最重要的是认清敌人，组织群众展开大规模的斗争。因此，日本人民目前不仅要对岸信介政府，同时要向美国政府进行强烈的抗议斗争，表达日本人民为争取和平与独立的坚决意志。
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本文化界团体纷纷举行会议，发表声明，表示反对岸信介政府同美国缔结新的“安全条约”。
    日本文化界人士组织的“安全条约批判会”联络委员会今天在扩大会议上决定，文化界人士将在1月11日举行“静默示威”，表示反对岸信介首相去美国签署新的“安全条约”。
    扩大会议还决定，“安全条约批判会”将同“安全条约问题研究会”联合发起写信给美国政界和文化界领导人的运动，说明修改后的“安全条约”的危险性。
    扩大会议还决定，批判会的代表将会见众议院议长和“惩罚委员会”负责人，抗议对浅沼稻次郎和其他三名社会党议员加以“惩罚”的企图。
    儿童文学家协会今天在东京举行讲演会，反对修改“安全条约”。
    日本记者会议今天发表声明，要求立即取消签订新的日美“安全条约”的计划。声明表示，如果岸信介政府不改变签订新的“安全条约”的态度，日本的新闻工作者决心采取一切可能的措施同日本人民同心协力来阻止签订这项日美军事同盟条约。
    在这以前，“安全条约”问题历史学家恳谈会曾发表声明，反对修改“安全条约”。
    新华社莫斯科24日电　“红星报”今天就日本首相岸信介即将去美国签订新的日美“安全条约”发表评论说，新的日美军事条约将是日本进一步军国主义化的条约。这一条约签订后将把日本变成美国的原子基地，一旦在远东发生军事冲突，日本将自动地加入到美国一边。它的危险性是显而易见的。
    评论指出，新的日美军事条约的签订，将是日本统治集团在战后日本历史中写下的最可耻的一页。
    评论谈到了日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争，并揭露了岸信介政府在美国支持下扩大武装力量的阴谋。评论说，日本的军队目前已增到二十二万人，陆海空军都在扩大。日本统治集团为了加速军国主义化，还在美国购买各种新式武器。岸信介政府的行动已经在日本人民之间引起了极大的愤怒。在日本，凡是头脑清醒的人都可以看出美日签订新的军事条约的危险性。
    评论说，在第二次世界大战中，日本人民受到了巨大牺牲，但是，日本统治集团现在还不想从过去事件中吸取教训，他们继续顽固地执行着那个已经一度使日本走向覆灭的政策，企图继续武装日本。
    评论最后说，日本应当放弃与美国的同盟，放弃危险的战争准备，只有独立和中立的道路才符合日本人民的利益。东京的公务人员也投入了轰轰烈烈的全国性反对岸政府卖国阴谋的斗争，这里是东京的五万名公务人员集会抗议美日修改“安全条约”。
