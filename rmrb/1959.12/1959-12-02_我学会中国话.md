	I Learned to Speak Chinese
	Albanian Student Nasimi
How did I come into this world? I was ignorant of everything at that time, only possessing a basic human instinct: to cry loudly when hungry and thirsty. Later, I gradually became familiar with my mother's singing, which flowed into my heart like a spring. It instilled intelligence and wisdom in me, and I will remember this song for the rest of my life. Time advances like a rushing river, and I have grown to be over twenty years old. Last year, my motherland entrusted me with the glorious task of studying in the great fraternal country. I traveled thousands of miles to China, where the Chinese people warmly welcomed me with embraces, handshakes, and flowers. How could I repay them? Difficulties blocked my way. At that time, I was like a mute, gesturing wildly and often making jokes. I never thought that I would grow up to be so old, yet only able to nod and shake my head like a baby. Now I can no longer learn to speak from my mother, as she is far away in Albania. Who can replace my beloved mother and teach me to speak a second time? "There are Chinese friends, a sincere friendship, they can teach you like a mother!" These words flowed into my heart like a spring again. More than a year has passed, and now I can converse in Chinese everywhere, write square Chinese characters, and reading Chinese books is no longer a rarity for me. Whose strength has enabled me to achieve such results today? It is the guidance of the teachers, the help of the classmates, and I am deeply grateful to them. When drinking water, don't forget the well-digger, I want to thank Chairman Mao. The Chinese comrades taught by Chairman Mao have taught me this most magnificent language.

    我学会中国话
    阿尔巴尼亚留学生　那斯米我怎样降生到了人间？当时的一切我都茫然，只有一种人的本能：饥渴时大声哭喊。后来，我渐渐熟悉妈妈的歌声，这歌声像泉水流入我的心，它灌注给我聪明和智慧，这歌声使我牢记一生。时间前进像奔流的河水，我已经长到了二十多岁。去年祖国交给我光荣的任务，让我到伟大的兄弟之邦学习。万里迢迢来到中国，中国人民热情地接待我，拥抱，握手，还有鲜花，怎么答谢？困难挡住了我。这时我如同一个哑吧，手脚乱比，常闹笑话，没有想到我长到这么大，却只会点头摇头像个娃娃。现在再不能向妈妈学话，妈妈远在阿尔巴尼亚。谁能代替亲爱的妈妈，第二次再教我说话？“有中国朋友，亲切的友谊，她可以像母亲一样教你！”这句话又像一股泉水，流进了我的心里。一年多的时间已过去，现在我可以用中文到处交谈，写方方块的汉字看中文书籍，对我来说也并不稀奇。是谁的力量，使我得到今天这样的成绩？那是老师的教导，同学的帮助，对他们我深深地感激。喝水不忘打井人，我要感谢毛主席。毛主席教导的中国同志，教会了我这最伟大的言语。
