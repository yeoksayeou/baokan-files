    Harvesting Cattails and Reeds Now Has Machines
    The Jinghai County Machinery Plant in Hebei Province has successfully trial-produced a waterborne automatic cattail and reed harvesting machine.

    The structure of this waterborne automatic cattail and reed harvesting machine is as follows: a blade is installed on the left side of a boat, and a 1.5-meter-wide harvesting platform is installed in front of the boat, enabling underwater operation. A rocker arm is installed on the bow of the boat, and after the reeds and cattails are cut, the rocker arm automatically twists them into bundles. It uses a six-horsepower twin-cylinder gasoline engine as power, which drives the flexible rotation of various parts through a transmission shaft. This machine requires only two people to operate and can harvest 60 to 70 mu of reeds per day, equivalent to the workload of 200 laborers.

     割蒲苇有了机器
    河北静海县机械厂试制成一台水上自动割蒲、割苇机。
    这台水上自动割蒲、割苇机的构造，是在一只船的左边装刀片，船身前装一点五米宽的收割台，能在水下作业。船头上装有摇臂，苇、蒲割下后，由摇臂自动扭成捆子。它用的动力是一台六马力的双缸汽油机，通过传动轴带动各个部位灵活转动。这种机器只用两人操作，每天能割苇六十到七十亩，相当于两百个劳动力的工作量。
