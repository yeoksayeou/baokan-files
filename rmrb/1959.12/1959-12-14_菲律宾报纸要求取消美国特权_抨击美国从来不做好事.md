Manila News: "Manila Times" columnist Rosces said on the 8th, when talking about US-Philippine relations, that "Americans never do anything good for the Philippines unless it is beneficial to Americans."

Roces opposed the much-publicized notion that American aid to the Philippines has always been very generous. He said the truth is that, before the war, the Philippines paid a price for the so-called improvement of its status, including paying the salaries of American administrative personnel below the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. After the war, Filipinos even allowed Americans to enjoy equal rights, and the United States was not only stingy in its economic assistance to the Philippines, but it has not even settled its wartime debts to this day.

Roces said, "In short, Americans have never been generous to the Philippines before, during, or after the war. The sooner Filipinos understand this, the better."

According to the "Manila Chronicle," another newspaper columnist, Villamin, demanded the abolition of equal rights enjoyed by Americans in a speech on the 10th. Villamin said that American exploitation of the Philippines' natural resources is detrimental to Philippine entrepreneurs.

Philippine Senator Claro Recto requested the Supreme Court on the 3rd to revoke the mining rights enjoyed by an American oil company under the "Equal Rights" Act and to recover the company's oil exploitation rights.

    菲律宾报纸要求取消美国特权
    抨击美国从来不做好事
    马尼拉消息　“马尼拉时报”专栏作家罗赛斯8日在谈到美菲关系时说，“美国人从来不替菲律宾做什么好事，除非那是对美国人有利的”。
    罗赛斯反对那种被大事宣传的所谓美国对菲律宾的帮助一直是非常慷慨的说法。他说，真相是，在战前，菲律宾对于自己地位的所谓提高付出了代价，其中包括付给菲律宾群岛总督以下美国行政人员的薪津。在战后，菲律宾人甚至让美国人享受平等权利，而美国不仅在给菲律宾的经济援助方面是小气的，它甚至到目前还没有清偿它的战时债务。
    罗赛斯说，“总之，美国人在战前、战争期间、战后都从来没有对菲律宾慷慨过。菲律宾人愈早了解这一点就愈好。”
    据“马尼拉纪事报”说，另一位报纸专栏作家比利亚明10日发表演说时要求取消美国人享有的平等权利。比利亚明说，美国人开发菲律宾的自然资源是损害了菲律宾的企业家。
    菲律宾参议员克拉罗·雷克托在3日要求最高法院取消一家美国石油公司根据“平等权利”法案而享有的开采矿藏的权利，并且收回这家公司的石油开采权。
