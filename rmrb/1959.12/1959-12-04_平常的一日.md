An Ordinary Day
    Zhu Tian Shun

    As if suddenly encountering an old comrade-in-arms I hadn't seen for many years, I saw a new book in a bookstore that was completely unexpected – "One Day in Central Hebei." This book was collectively created by the broad masses, soldiers, and cadres of the Central Hebei Anti-Japanese Base Area, writing about the struggle and life of the military and civilians of Central Hebei on May 27, 1941 – this ordinary day. At that time, it was printed and published using wheat straw paper. This current version is organized and published by the Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House based on the original mimeographed copies of the first collection and the typed and reprinted copies of the second collection. The third and fourth collections have not yet been found.

    Eighteen years have passed. As one of the authors of this book, seeing it republished in the capital of the motherland after the victory of the revolution, infinite emotion surged into my heart.

    I sat under the lamp, silently flipping through the book's table of contents, as if returning to that fighting era. On that boundless Central Hebei Plain, most of the county towns and market towns had become strongholds of the Japanese invaders. Under each gray and gloomy pillbox was a world of ghosts and monsters. Outside the strongholds, there were the iron troops – the Eighth Route Army's Third Column, and the strong eight million people of Central Hebei, who were resolutely fighting the enemy day and night. There were no mountains here, but thousands of millions of people were continuous mountain peaks, using their lives to protect their own soldiers under the enemy's bayonets. There was no Great Wall here, but thousands of millions of people dug interconnected tunnels and trenches, allowing the soldiers to fight and transfer smoothly. There was no theater here, but every village and every unit had its own theater troupe and its own excellent actors. Almost every soldier and cadre had a steel pen, using it to study and to write. "One Day in Central Hebei" is the footprint of the era they recorded. In this ordinary day of life-and-death struggle they wrote, there was the joy of victory, the heroic sacrifice, the intense work, the friendship of battle…

    Suddenly, the high-pitched voice of the announcer on the radio awakened me from my memories. He was broadcasting the new production upsurge that had been launched on the production front after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. So, I thought of this ordinary day that I had just spent today.

    As soon as I got to work today, an old comrade working in the people's commune in my hometown came to see me. As soon as he sat down, he began to introduce me to the situation in their commune.

    "Have you heard? The water is really big this year! I'm over fifty years old, and I haven't seen such a big flood a few times..."

    I knew that their commune was close to a small river, a famous strange river that was "a line when it's dry, and floods when it's wet." In an instant, the scene of the 1939 flood appeared in my mind: a vast ocean, crops trembling in the whirlpool, houses collapsing, torrents carrying farm tools and debris... I asked worriedly, "How serious is the disaster?"

    "Disaster? An unprecedented bumper harvest! After the establishment of the people's commune and the large-scale water conservancy movement, those rivers that were like unruly livestock have been leashed. They can't run wild like they used to." A smile appeared on his simple, tanned face.

    Then, he talked endlessly about the harvest, the water conservancy movement this year, the public canteen... Like in the war years, he talked about victory with relish during the lulls in battle.

    This old comrade has already returned to the commune by train this afternoon, but his hearty laughter still echoes in my ears...

    With the singing from the radio, I flipped through my new book again – "One Day in Central Hebei." It seemed to me that a solid long bridge spanned the two ordinary days of eighteen years ago and today. This long bridge is composed of the General Line formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao.

    It is precisely by following this long bridge built by the Party and Chairman Mao that the Chinese people have emerged from the long night and planted socialist flowers everywhere. If the Chinese people, in those days of fighting against "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up operations," when the sky seemed dark, stood at the first section of this long bridge and saw the mast of the ship of New China emerging from the horizon, then now on this long bridge, we can see a pattern of a strong socialist country. I think that in the near future, on any ordinary day, every Chinese person will look back on their current ordinary day with a feeling that is more excited and more grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao than I am today.

    I sat under the lamp, flipping through the book's table of contents with excitement and emotion. Many familiar names and familiar faces appeared before my eyes. They are my close comrades, and also the authors of this book, and now, some are no longer in the world. They gave their lives for the liberation of the motherland and for the happiness of future generations. I stared at this new book, lost in thought, even to commemorate these comrades, I should not waste any ordinary day. (Attached picture)

    平常的一日
    朱田顺
    好像突然遇到一位多年不见的老战友一样，在书店里看到了一本完全出乎我意料之外的新书——“冀中一日”。这本书是由冀中抗日根据地的广大群众、战士和干部集体创作的，写的是在1941年5月27日——这个平常的一日里，冀中抗日军民的斗争和生活情况。当时，它是用麦秸纸油印出版的。现在这个版本，是百花文艺出版社根据第一辑原油印本和第二辑打字翻印本整理出版的。第三、第四辑现在还没有找到。
    十八年了，作为本书的作者之一，在革命胜利后祖国的首都，看到这本书重新出版，无限的感慨泛上了我的心头。
    我坐在灯下，默默地翻阅着全书的目录，仿佛又回到那战斗的年代。在那一望无际的冀中大平原上，大部分县城和集镇，都成了日寇的据点。每一座灰郁郁的碉堡下，都是鬼蜮魍魉的世界。而在据点的外面，有铁的子弟兵——八路军第三纵队，有坚强的八百万冀中人民，他们日日夜夜地和敌人进行着坚决的斗争。这里没有山，但是，千百万人民就是连绵不断的山峰，他们在敌人的刺刀下，用自己的生命，掩护着子弟兵。这里没有长城，但是，千百万人民挖下了四通八达的地道和道沟，让子弟兵顺利地战斗和转移。这里没有剧院，但是，每一个村庄，每一支部队，都有自己的剧团，有自己的优秀演员。这里差不多每一个战士和干部都有枝钢笔，他们用它学习，用它写作。“冀中一日”就是他们记录下来的时代的足迹。在他们写下的这个生死斗争的平常的一日里，有胜利的欢笑，有壮烈的牺牲，有紧张的工作，有战斗的友谊……。
    忽然，收音机里广播员同志的高吭的声音，把我正从回忆里唤醒。他在播送着党的八届八中全会以后，在生产战线上所掀起的新的生产高潮。于是，我又想起我今天刚刚度过的这个平常的一日了。
    今天一上班，一位在家乡人民公社工作的老同志来看我，他一坐下就向我介绍起他们公社的情况来。
    “你听说了吗？今年的水真大呀！我活了五十多岁，像这样的大水没见过几次……”。
    我知道他们的公社紧靠着一条小河，这条河是有名的“旱了像条线，涝了淹一片”的怪河。刹那间，1939年闹水灾的情景，在我脑海里浮现：一片汪洋大海，庄稼叶子在漩涡里战栗，房倒屋塌，激流里卷着农具、杂物……。我担心地问：“灾情大小？”
    “灾情？空前的大丰收！成立了人民公社，大搞水利运动以后，那些像不驯顺的牲口一样的河流，都被拴上了笼头。它们像过去那样撒野是不行了。”他那淳朴的褐色的脸上泛起了笑纹。
    接着，他滔滔不绝地谈起了丰收的情景，谈起了今年的水利运动，谈起了公共食堂……。像过去战争的年代，在战斗空隙的时候，津津有味地谈论着胜利。
    这位老同志，今天下午已经乘火车回到公社去了，可是他那爽朗的笑声，仍然响在我的耳边……
    随着收音机里的歌声，我又翻阅着我的新书——
  “冀中一日”。我好像看到，在十八年前的和今天的这两个平常的一日之间，架着一座牢固的长桥。这座长桥是由党和毛主席所制订的总路线组成的。
    中国人民，正是循着党和毛主席所搭起的这座长桥，走出了漫漫长夜，遍植起社会主义的鲜花。假如说，中国人民在那反“围剿”、反“扫荡”的日子，在天空似乎是黑暗的时候，站立在这座长桥的第一段，就看到了新中国航船的桅顶冒出地平线的话，那末，现在在这座长桥上，又可以看到一个社会主义强国的图案。我想，不久的将来，在任何一个平常的一日，每一个中国人民都将怀着比我今天更为兴奋，更为感激党和毛主席的心情，来回顾他们现在的平常的一日。
    我坐在灯下，兴奋而又激动地翻阅着全书的目录，许多熟悉的名字，熟悉的面孔，浮现在我的眼前。他们是我的亲密的同志，也是本书的作者，而现在，有些已经不在人间了。他们为了祖国的解放，为了后代人的幸福，贡献出了自己的生命。我凝视着这本新书，陷入了沉思，即使为了纪念这些同志，我也不应该虚度任何一个平常的一日。（附图片）
