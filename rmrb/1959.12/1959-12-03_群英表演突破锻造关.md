　　On November 17th, the municipal technical promotion group's forging team came to our factory to observe and provide guidance. The members of this team included Wang Yuzhen from Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Bian Xiaozheng from Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, and Huang Jun from Xingping Machinery Plant, all representatives who attended the National Congress of Heroes. Their arrival at our factory was warmly welcomed by the workers.

　　After they arrived at the factory, the director of the forging workshop, the technicians, and the experienced masters told them that the main production task of our factory's forging workers was to forge twenty-cubic-meter air compressor connecting rods. It is not only a major part of the product, but also a part urgently awaiting processing in the next process, and a key part for the entire factory to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule. However, due to the lack of advanced tools and operations, the production efficiency has been low, taking about two hours to forge a blank. After listening, the heroes immediately went to the site to observe and provide guidance. In response to the shortcomings of our forging tools and operations, they put forward three innovation suggestions: use "straight knife straight down cutting" instead of toothed knife turning to cut; use "sling mold" to forge the small end, instead of gas cutting after forging in the past; change from forging the middle first and then the two ends to forging the two ends first and then the middle. They also personally gave operation demonstrations. Sure enough, the effect was outstanding, reducing the time to forge a connecting rod from two hours to half an hour, increasing the output by three times. The workers were so happy that they beamed with joy on the spot. According to the workers' requests, the heroes introduced important advanced experiences such as observing temperature with the naked eye, quickly forging hexagons, improving the clamping hammer, and repairing reflecting furnaces at the symposium. Xin Liming, an experienced forging master, said to them with emotion: "In the past, we could not think of effective methods to increase production in forging production. Thanks to your help, you have really added a lot of experience to us!"

    群英表演突破锻造关
    11月17日，市里组织的技术推广团锻工组，来到我厂观摩指导。这个组的成员有出席全国群英会的代表——北京汽车制造厂王玉珍、长辛店机车车辆厂边孝正、兴平机械厂黄俊等同志。他们来到我厂，受到了职工群众的热烈欢迎。
    他们到了厂里，锻工车间的主任、技术员、老师傅就告诉他们，我厂锻工目前的主要生产任务是锻二十立方米空压机连杆。它既是产品的主要件，又是下道工序急待加工件，也是全厂提前完成全年计划的关键件，但因工具和操作上不够先进，生产效率一直不高，锻一个毛坯需要两个小时左右。英雄们听完后，马上就深入现场观摩指导，针对我们的锻造工具和操作方法上的缺点，提出三项革新建议：用“直刀直下切料”，代替牙刀转打下料；用“甩子模”锻小头，代替过去锻后再汽割；由先锻中间后锻两头，改为先锻两头后锻中间。他们还亲自作了操作表演。果然，效果突出，锻一根连杆，由过去两小时减为半小时，产量提高了三倍。当场乐得工人们眉开眼笑。根据工人的要求，英雄们在座谈会上又介绍了用肉眼观察温度、快速锻六方、改进夹板锤、修造反射炉等重要的先进经验。锻工老师傅辛立明感动地对他们说：“过去在锻造生产上，总想不出有效的方法来提高产量，多亏你们的帮助，真给我们增加了不少经验啊！”
