One Person's Innovation Drives Collective Innovation

Communist Party member Wang Shuhe is the workshop director of the Shule River Locomotive Depot Factory of the Urumqi Railway Bureau in Xinjiang. For more than three years, he has not only actively promoted advanced experience, but also has innovations and creations almost every month. These creations and innovations have solved key problems in production at different times.

Wang Shuhe not only has a pioneering spirit, but also enthusiastically helps others. He often says: "One person's innovation is never as effective as everyone's innovation." Since April of this year alone, he has helped comrades in his group improve and make more than thirty kinds of tools. There was a comrade in his mechanic group who often produced defective products, and everyone jokingly called him the "King of Defective Products." Hearing this title, Wang Shuhe always felt uncomfortable. He thought: This comrade often produces defective products, which is of course related to his thinking and drive, but I, as the group leader, have not fulfilled my responsibility. One day, this worker embarrassedly walked up to him and said, "Group Leader Wang, I've ruined another big bearing shell." Wang Shuhe felt really anxious when he heard this. But he still calmly said, "It can still be processed; I'll help you deal with it later." Then he helped the worker process the big bearing shell and pointed out his shortcomings of carelessness and not studying technology, encouraging him by saying, "We are not afraid of making mistakes, but we are afraid of not paying attention to mistakes and not having the courage to correct them. As long as you correct them, that's good." Later, Wang Shuhe also inspired everyone to carry out mutual ideological and technical assistance to ensure that no one produced defective products. This worker also received a great education from this. One evening, he created a new record for the whole group by turning a locomotive big bearing shell in fifty-six minutes, exceeding the quota by 162%.

    一人革新带动众人革新
    共产党员王树和，是新疆乌鲁木齐铁路局疏勒河机务段工厂的车间主任。三年多来，他不仅积极推广先进经验，而且几乎是月月有创造、有革新。这些创造、革新，都在不同时期解决了生产中的关键问题。
    王树和不但具有首创精神，而且热情帮助别人。他常说：一个人革新总不如大家革新作用大。仅今年4月份以来，他就帮助组里同志改进、制作了三十多种工具。他领导的机工组有个同志老出废品，大伙开玩笑时叫他是“废品大王”。听到这种称呼，王树和的心里总觉得不好受。他想：这个同志常出废品，当然和他的思想、干劲有关系，但我这个组长也没有尽到责任。一天，这个工人又难为情地走到他身旁说：“王组长，我又旋坏了一个大瓦。”王树和一听，心里真着急。但他还是平静地说：“还可以继续加工，回头我帮你处理”。接着他帮助这个工人加工好了大瓦，并指出他疏忽大意、不钻研技术的缺点，鼓励他说：“我们不怕犯错误，就怕不重视错误，没有改正错误的勇气。只要改了就是好的。”以后王树和又启发大家开展了思想、技术互助，保证大家都不出废品。这个工人也从中受了很大的教育，一天晚上就创造了五十六分钟旋一块机车大瓦的全组最高纪录，突破定额162％。
