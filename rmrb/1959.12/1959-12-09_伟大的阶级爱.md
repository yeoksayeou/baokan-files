Great Class Love
Yi Heyuan

"Closer than Blood" narrates a touching story.

People hold the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in utmost respect, calling them "the most beloved people." Because of them, we can live a peaceful and happy life, and carry out large-scale economic construction. Some comrades heroically sacrificed themselves in the fight against the enemy. People deeply mourn them, thank them, and their great achievements will forever be remembered in people's hearts.

The government and people give great care and attention to the living—the families of revolutionary martyrs. The annual campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers and martyrs is so enthusiastic and moving. Even the Young Pioneers actively participate, trying every possible way to do things for the families of martyrs and soldiers. They all understand that victory and happiness are hard-won, and concern for the living is a sign of gratitude and respect for the martyrs.

Comrade Yuan Dianchen, the son of Grandma Yuan, is a good son of the Chinese people. In order to resist the aggression of American imperialism and defend the country, he resolutely joined the Chinese People's Volunteers. Grandma Yuan is a good mother. She did not hold her son back. In order to defend everyone's happy life, she also resolutely handed over her son, on whom she depended for life.

Comrade Yuan Dianchen sacrificed himself. Grandma Yuan lost her own son, but she gained more sons, just as the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteers said when comforting her: "Don't be too sad, old lady, we are all your sons..." And she also gained a son like Comrade Shuai Shiyan, who is "closer than blood."

Comrade Shuai Shiyan, a demobilized soldier, has a noble soldier's heart. He takes the place of his comrade-in-arms Yuan Dianchen to fulfill the responsibility of a son, caring for Grandma Yuan as if she were his own mother. He concretely expresses the deep feelings of millions of people and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteers. This is great class love!

"Closer than Blood," this is precisely the crystallization of the proletariat's bones and the proletariat's blood. This great class love will be widely spread and carried forward in our land!

    伟大的阶级爱
    易和元
    “亲骨亲血”叙述了一个动人心弦的佳话。
    人们对中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军怀着无比的尊敬，把他们叫做“最可爱的人”，有了他们，我们才能过着和平幸福的生活，才能进行大规模的经济建设。有些同志在和敌人搏斗中，英勇地牺牲了，人们深切的悼念他们，感谢他们，他们的丰功伟绩将永远记在人们的心里。
    而对于生者——革命烈士的家属们，政府和人民给予了极大的关怀和照顾，每年的拥军优属运动，气氛那么热烈，场面那么动人，连红领巾们也都积极地参加了，想方设法要为烈、军属做事。他们也都懂得：胜利和幸福得来不易，对生者的关心，正是表示对烈士们的感激和尊敬。
    袁大妈的儿子袁殿臣同志，是中国人民的好儿子，他为了抗击美帝国主义的侵略，保家卫国，毅然决然地参加了中国人民志愿军；袁大妈是一个好妈妈，他没有拉儿子的后腿，为了保卫大家幸福的生活，她也毅然决然地交出了她的相依为命的儿子。
    袁殿臣同志牺牲了，袁大妈失去了亲生的儿子，但是却有了更多的儿子，正如解放军、志愿军战士们在安慰她时所说的：“你老人家别太伤心，我们都是你的儿子。……”而且还有了像帅士炎同志这样的“亲骨亲血”的儿子。
    复员军人帅士炎同志，有着一颗崇高的战士的心，他代替战友袁殿臣同志去尽一个儿子的责任，关怀袁大妈就像关怀自己的妈妈一样，他具体地表达了千百万人民和解放军、志愿军战士的深厚感情。这是伟大的阶级爱！
    “亲骨亲血”，这正是无产阶级的骨和无产阶级的血的结晶，这种伟大的阶级爱，将在我们的国土上普遍传播，发扬光大！
