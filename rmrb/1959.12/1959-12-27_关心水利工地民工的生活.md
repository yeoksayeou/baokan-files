　　Concern for the Lives of Migrant Workers on Water Conservancy Construction Sites

The Nan Zhao County Committee in Henan Province, to ensure that the county's more than 50,000-strong water conservancy army was well-fed, warmly clothed, and well-housed, organized an inspection and慰問团(comfort) delegation to the construction sites last month. This inspection and慰問团(comfort) delegation not only inspected the work on the water conservancy construction sites and gave enthusiastic encouragement and慰問团(comfort) to the people engaged in water conservancy construction, but more importantly, promptly solved the problem of sufficient supply of grain and vegetables to the construction sites, rushed to make cotton clothing and cotton shoes for the migrant workers, assisted each construction site in building more than 1,100 new houses and 860 simple dining halls, and organized more than 1,000 specialized firewood and coal transport teams to transport large quantities of firewood and coal to the construction sites. After this inspection and慰問团(comfort), various construction sites have transferred and stored enough grain, vegetables, firewood, grass, etc., to ensure the supply of daily necessities for the masses. The comrades in Nan Zhao County did this very timely and very important.

At present, there are about 70 million water conservancy workers across the country who are fighting the earth with the heroic spirit of overwhelming mountains and rivers. Although some construction sites are already covered with heavy snow, the migrant workers are in high spirits and full of fighting spirit, splitting high mountains, filling deep gullies, blasting rocky cliffs, and digging canals. Their spirit is like that described by Comrade Mao Zedong in his poem "Farewell to the God of Plague": "The silver hoe falls connecting the Five Ridges to the sky, the iron arms shake moving the three rivers." Under such circumstances, the leadership must pay close attention to their lives, so that they have both work and rest, combining work and rest; so that they eat well, sleep well, rest well, are healthy, and work happily. Only in this way can their high enthusiasm for work and soaring revolutionary drive be maintained, and the water conservancy movement can develop faster and faster.

To mobilize the masses, to make the masses engage in the revolutionary cause with full enthusiasm, we must first pay attention to political and ideological work, and at the same time, we must care about the lives of the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly put forward this issue in his article "Be Concerned with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work" written in January 1934. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Do you want to win the support of the masses? Do you want the masses to put their full strength into the battle line? Then you must be with the masses, you must arouse the enthusiasm of the masses, you must care about the pain of the masses, you must sincerely seek the interests of the masses, solve the problems of production and life of the masses, the problem of salt, the problem of rice, the problem of houses, the problem of clothing, the problem of giving birth to children, and solve all the problems of the masses." The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party last year also pointed out that "the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party should care about the lives of the masses. The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be." Therefore, to do a good job in leadership, first, we must be good at closely combining organizing mass production and organizing mass life. Second, we must be good at combining work and rest, labor and rest. This especially needs more attention on water conservancy construction sites. At present, although many construction sites have achieved semi-mechanization, the labor is still relatively heavy. If the working hours are too long or the rest after work is not good or the food is not good, it will affect the health of the migrant workers. Many construction sites are in remote mountains and wild ridges. After the arrival of winter, we should pay more attention to arranging the lives of the migrant workers. This year's water conservancy tasks are heavy, time is tight, requirements are high, and there are many migrant workers participating in the construction, numbering in the tens of millions nationwide. Arranging the lives of so many migrant workers is not only a problem directly related to production, but also a problem of great political significance.

How to care about the lives of the masses? That is to ensure that the masses eat well, live well, rest well, and have good safety and hygiene. To eat well, that is to make them eat hot meals, hot dishes, and hot soup. The rice should be both dry and thin, both hard and soft. The dishes should be as varied as possible and taste good. To eat well, larger construction sites must run the construction site canteens well. Not only must the rear ensure that the front has enough grain and vegetables, but the construction site canteens must grow their own vegetables, raise pigs, and raise chickens, so that everyone can eat better. To live well, that is to make all the masses participating in water conservancy construction live in houses, cave dwellings, or sheds. The sheds, cave dwellings, and houses should be protected from rain and snow, moisture-proof, and have heating equipment for cold weather. To rest well, that is to ensure that the migrant workers have at least eight hours of sleep and four hours of eating and rest. In addition, there must be certain cultural and recreational activities. Organize film projection teams to tour and show movies, organize theater troupes to perform at construction sites, or organize migrant workers to write, perform, and watch themselves. Good safety and hygiene, that is to ensure that no major diseases or major work-related injuries occur on the construction site; to ensure that the meals, dishes, and chopsticks are clean, and pay attention to the environmental hygiene of the construction site; the houses, especially the sheds, must have fire-fighting equipment. At the same time, in addition to conducting safety education for the masses, each construction site must also have medical equipment and medical personnel, so that the masses can receive timely treatment after illness or work-related injuries.

There are two ways to improve the lives of the masses on water conservancy construction sites: one is to have a few people do it, which is slow, poor, and wasteful; the other is to mobilize the broad masses to solve it together, which can be more, faster, better, and more economical. Now many construction sites have adopted the latter method, such as organizing a life management committee to assist the leadership in managing the life of the construction site; holding meetings of life representatives to discuss improving the quality of life; and mobilizing the masses to raise pigs and grow vegetables in their spare time. The Jiǎ Mòdài Reservoir in Yuanjiang County, Yunnan, in addition to organizing specialized personnel to raise pigs and grow vegetables, also mobilized the migrant workers to grow vegetables in their spare time. In about a month, the entire construction site planted 44 acres of vegetables, raised 51 pigs, and fed 114 chickens, greatly improving the life of the construction site. It can be seen that taking the method of mobilizing the masses not only does not cost much money, but also can solve the problem more thoroughly and comprehensively.

To ensure that the migrant workers on the construction site have work and rest, eat well, rest well, and have good safety and hygiene, we must implement putting politics in command, unified leadership, mobilizing the masses, coordinating all parties, twisting up and down, left and right into one rope, and working together to properly arrange and handle the living problems of the masses. Specifically, the Party Committee should designate a secretary to personally grasp the issue of the lives of the masses on the water conservancy construction site. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, it should organize finance and trade, transportation, grain, health, welfare and other departments to serve the construction site masses' eating problems, housing problems, clothing problems, hair-cutting problems, medical problems, and other various life problems. What is particularly important is that leaders at all levels, like Henan Nan Zhao, should often go deep into the water conservancy construction sites for inspection and慰問团(comfort), on the one hand, to boost morale, and on the other hand, to enable the leading organs to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Party committees at all levels and leading cadres in charge of life and welfare issues should also conduct political and ideological education for the cooks, managers, and other service personnel at the construction site, carry out appraisals and competitions, set up models, insert red flags, and enable these personnel to establish a clear idea of serving the water conservancy army, earnestly do their work well, so that the lives of the migrant workers on the water conservancy construction site can be continuously improved.

We firmly believe that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it, and mobilizes the masses and strengthens organizational work, we will certainly be able to improve the lives of the masses on the water conservancy construction site, and we will certainly be able to enable the masses to always maintain full enthusiasm for work and soaring revolutionary drive, work hard, work diligently, and work skillfully, and the water conservancy construction tasks this winter and next spring will certainly be completed victoriously.

### 关心水利工地民工的生活

　　关心水利工地民工的生活
    河南省南召县委为了保证全县五万多名水利大军吃饱、穿暖、住好，曾在上个月组织了一个检查慰问团到工地上去。这个检查慰问团不只是检查了水利工地的工作，对从事水利建设的人们加以热情的鼓励和慰问，更重要的是及时地解决了工地的粮食和蔬菜的充分供应，为民工赶制了棉衣、棉鞋，协助各工地盖起了一千一百多间新房和八百六十间简易饭厅，并且组织了一千多个运柴运煤专业队，为工地大量运送柴、煤。经过这次检查、慰问，各个工地已经调运储备了足够的粮、菜、柴、草等，保证了群众生活必需品的供应。南召县的同志们这样做是非常适时和十分重要的。
    目前，全国共有七千万左右水利大军，正在以气吞山河的英雄气概向地球作战。有些工地虽然已是大雪纷飞，但是民工们精神抖擞，斗志昂扬，劈高山，填深沟，炸石崖，挖渠道，其气魄就像毛泽东同志“送瘟神”诗中所形容的：“天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇。”在这样的情况下，领导上必须十分关心他们的生活，使他们有劳有逸，劳逸结合；使他们吃得好，睡得好，休息得好，身体健康，劳动愉快。只有这样，他们高涨的劳动热情和冲天的革命干劲才能保持下来，水利运动才能发展得愈来愈快。
    要发动群众，要使群众干劲十足地从事于革命事业，首先要注意政治思想工作，同时也要关心群众的生活。对于这个问题，毛泽东同志早在1934年1月写的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中，就明确地提出来了。毛泽东同志说：“要得到群众的拥护么？要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性，就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题，盐的问题，米的问题，房子的问题，衣的问题，生小孩子的问题，解决群众的一切问题。”去年党的八届六中全会的决议也指出，“群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。”因此，作好领导工作，第一，必须善于把组织群众生产和组织群众生活密切结合起来。第二，必须善于把劳和逸、劳动和休息结合起来。这在水利工地尤其需要倍加关心。目前，虽然有不少工地实现了半机械化，但是劳动还是比较繁重，如果劳动时间过长或者劳动以后休息得不好、吃得不好，都会影响到民工身体的健康。许多工地在荒山野岭，冬季来临以后，更要注意安排好民工生活。今年水利任务大，时间紧，要求高，参加建设的民工多，全国以千万计。把这么多的民工的生活安排好，不仅是一个同生产直接有关的问题，而且也是一个有重大政治意义的问题。
    如何关心群众的生活呢？这就是要保证群众吃得好，住得好，休息好，安全卫生好。吃得好，就是要使他们吃到热饭、热菜、热汤，饭力求有干有稀、有硬有软；菜要尽可能做到花样多、口味好。要吃得好，较大的工地就要办好工地食堂，不仅后方要保证前方有足够的粮食、菜蔬，而且工地食堂要自己种菜、养猪、养鸡，这样大家就能吃得更好。住得好，就是要使所有参加水利建设的群众都能住在房屋、窑洞或工棚里，工棚、窑洞和房屋要防雨雪，防潮湿，严冬要有防寒取暖设备。休息好，就是要保证民工至少要有八小时的睡眠时间、四小时的吃饭和休息时间。此外还要有一定的文化娱乐活动。组织电影队巡回放映电影，组织剧团到工地演戏，或者组织民工自编、自演、自看。安全卫生好，就是要保证工地上不发生重大疾病和重大工伤事故；要做到饭菜、碗筷清洁，注意工地的环境卫生；房屋特别是工棚要有防火设备。同时，除对群众进行安全教育外，各个工地还要有医疗设备和医务人员，使群众在疾病或发生工伤事故后能够及时得到治疗。
    改善水利工地群众生活有两个办法，一是由少数人来做，这就少慢差费；一是发动广大群众一起来解决，这就可以多快好省。现在有不少工地采取了后一个办法，例如组织生活管理委员会，协同领导管理工地生活；召开生活代表会议，讨论改善生活问题；发动群众利用业余时间养猪、种菜。云南元江县假莫代水库，除了组织专人养猪、种菜以外，还发动民工利用空余时间种菜。约莫一个月时间，全工地种了蔬菜四十四亩，养猪五十一头，喂鸡一百一十四只，工地生活大大改善。可见采取发动群众的办法，不仅不需要花多少钱，而且可以把问题解决得更彻底更全面。
    要保证工地民工有劳有逸，吃得好，休息得好和安全卫生好，必须实行政治挂帅，统一领导，发动群众，各方配合，上下左右拧成一股绳，一齐为妥善安排、处理好群众的生活问题而努力。具体地说，党委要指定一位书记亲自抓水利工地的群众生活问题，要在党委的统一领导下，组织财贸、交通、粮食、卫生、福利等部门一齐为工地群众的吃饭问题、住房问题、穿衣问题、理发问题、医药问题等等各种生活问题服务。特别重要的是，各级领导要像河南南召一样，经常深入水利工地进行检查、慰问，一方面可以鼓舞士气，另一方面可以使领导机关能够及时发现问题和解决问题。各级党委和专管生活福利问题的领导干部，还应当对工地的炊事、管理人员和其他服务人员进行政治思想教育，开展评比、竞赛，树标兵、插红旗，使这些人员树立明确的为水利大军服务的思想，认真做好自己的工作，使水利工地民工的生活能够不断得到改善。
    我们深信，只要领导重视，并且发动群众，加强组织工作，就一定可以把水利工地上的群众生活搞好，就一定可以使群众经常保持饱满的劳动热情和冲天的革命干劲，实干、苦干和巧干，今冬明春的水利建设任务一定能够胜利完成。
