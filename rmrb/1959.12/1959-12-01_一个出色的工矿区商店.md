An Excellent Factory and Mining Area Store

The Tongjialiang Store in Kouquan District, Datong City, Shanxi Province, is a red flag among stores in factory, mining, and forestry areas. Under the leadership of the Party, the employees of this store strive to move forward, work hard, and come up with many good ideas. They have taken on the task of organizing the entire economic life of more than 3,300 households with over 19,300 residents within a radius of twenty li in the Datong Tongjialiang mining area, actively supporting the leap forward in the production of the Tongjialiang Coal Mine, and becoming a powerful "logistics department" for the mining area. In October, the Central Ministry of Commerce held a national on-site conference on supply and service work in factory and mining areas there. The conference introduced the store's experience in organizing economic life and supporting production. The comrades who attended also visited the site in depth, and were deeply impressed, unanimously expressing that they would learn from Tongjialiang and catch up with Tongjialiang.

Although the Tongjialiang Store serves coal mine production and the lives of miners, the business experience and working methods they have created are not only applicable to other coal mining areas, but also to factory, mining, and forestry areas such as steel, petroleum, and forestry. Why? Because factory, mining, and forestry areas, like coal mining areas, are often located in originally barren or sparsely populated areas, and everything has to be started from scratch. Factory, mining, and forestry areas, especially new ones, originally have no or very few supply and service industries. However, the vast number of employees and their families, like urban residents, need food, clothing, daily necessities, bathing, haircuts, washing, mending, and repairing bicycles. Therefore, the stores established in factory, mining, and forestry areas cannot only engage in purchasing and sales, cannot only sell daily necessities, and cannot be like ordinary stores in cities that only receive customers at the counter. They must directly take on the responsibility of organizing the economic life of the people—employees and their families. This is an extremely glorious task that the Party and the state have given to commercial employees in factory, mining, and forestry areas. How to accomplish this task? The experience of the Tongjialiang Store points out the direction for us.

What is the main experience of the Tongjialiang Store?

One of the main experiences of the Tongjialiang Store is to rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and organize all employees to conscientiously implement the idea of "everything for production, accelerating socialist construction" in all work and activities, and to continuously overcome various incorrect ideas, so that store employees are full of enthusiasm and soaring energy. The employees of the Tongjialiang Store understand that doing a good job in commercial supply and service can produce more coal and accelerate socialist construction. The miners' struggle goals are the service goals of the store employees, sharing the worries and joys of the miners. When the miners put forward the slogan of "achieving a 10,000-ton mine (an average monthly output of 10,000 tons of coal from all working faces in the mining area)," they put forward "everything to serve the 10,000-ton mine." Everyone puts the idea of serving the 10,000-ton mine into their work, with great enthusiasm, high confidence, not afraid of difficulties, and diligently. When miners need gloves, they send the gloves to the mine. When miners want to drink cool beverages, they send the cool beverages into the well. When miners don't have time to wash and mend clothes, they organize mending teams. When miners need to take baths and get haircuts, they open bathhouses and barber shops. When the miners' demand for non-staple food increases, they organize the families of employees and nearby people's communes to grow vegetables, raise pigs, raise chickens, and so on. The miners work three shifts a day, and they also work three shifts. Therefore, to learn from the Tongjialiang Store and catch up with the Tongjialiang Store, the first thing is to learn from their business philosophy and work attitude of serving production and serving the lives of the masses. Supply what is needed for production. Supply to wherever production goes. Supply during the day if needed. Supply at night if needed. Leave the trouble to ourselves, and provide convenience to the employees.

The second main experience of the Tongjialiang Store is to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and adhere to the working method of the mass line in all work, and adhere to the democratic management system of three participations (cadres participate in labor, employees participate in management, and the masses participate in supervision and management). The Tongjialiang Store has a total of only about one hundred staff members, averaging less than one person for every hundred residents. Therefore, in addition to relying on all store employees to do a good job, they also organize the families of employees to sell goods on commission, grow vegetables, raise pigs, raise chickens, wash clothes, mend clothes, and engage in various sideline businesses. The experience of the Tongjialiang Store proves that the families of employees are indeed very enthusiastic and have great potential in helping to run the business well. Mobilizing them can become a huge force for supply and service. Organizing the families of employees to grow vegetables, raise pigs, raise chickens, raise ducks, make tofu, etc., can not only expand the source of goods, but also increase the income of employee families. Organizing the families of employees to sew clothes, wash clothes, and sell some goods on commission can widely establish various stores and service points without increasing the number of commercial employees. This can not only facilitate residents to buy things, but also enable store employees to concentrate their efforts on supplying to the pit entrance and underground, organizing day and night supply, and operating various necessary businesses. At the same time, by organizing the families of employees to participate in commercial activities and educating them, their awareness can be raised, making them more concerned about production and socialist construction, thereby promoting family harmony, enhancing neighborhood friendship, and further improving interpersonal relationships, which is conducive to the development of production.

The third main experience of the Tongjialiang Store is to determine the establishment of the commercial network and supply methods from the starting point of serving production and facilitating the masses. This is the combination of state-owned stores and agency stores, the combination of fixed stores and mobile stores, the combination of above-ground stores and underground stores, the combination of setting up stalls in separate areas and delivering goods to the door, and the combination of store business and amateur window business. By adopting these five combined supply methods, it can be ensured that the store network is wide, the supply time is long, suitable for the needs of continuous production day and night, suitable for the needs of scattered residential areas of employees, so that employees and their families can buy things at any time, run less, not queue, save time, and save manpower. These experiences of the Tongjialiang Store are applicable to all factory, mining, and forestry areas.

The fourth main experience of the Tongjialiang Store is to actively strive for the leadership and support of the mining area Party committee. The mining area Party committee regards the store as a component of the coal mine, and the store Party branch regards itself as the "logistics department" of the coal mine. Industry and commerce are as close as a family. To do a good job in production, the production department must rely on the store to supply some means of production, labor protection supplies, and do a good job in the welfare of employees. The commercial department serves the employees and supports production, so it must actively understand the needs of employees' lives and production, and actively help production units solve problems. For example, in order to support the needs of the coal area, they organize agricultural and commercial cooperation to help nearby people's communes develop non-staple food production. This proactive spirit is extremely valuable. The experience of the Tongjialiang Store proves that close cooperation and mutual support between industrial and commercial departments will surely do a good job in production and achieve common leap forward.

Over the past decade, our country has built and developed many factory, mining, and forestry areas. In the future continued leap forward, we will also build new factory, mining, and forestry areas, and expand existing factory, mining, and forestry areas. Therefore, doing a good job in the commercial supply work in factory, mining, and forestry areas is increasingly becoming an important task for commercial employees. We need thousands upon thousands of "Tongjialiang Stores." The employees engaged in commercial work in factory, mining, and forestry areas must exert great efforts, establish great ambitions, learn from the Tongjialiang Store, establish their own "Tongjialiang Store," and organize the economic life of the people in factory, mining, and forestry areas very well!

### 一个出色的工矿区商店

    一个出色的工矿区商店
    山西省大同市口泉区同家梁商店是工矿林区商店的一面红旗。这个商店的职工在党的领导下，争上游，鼓干劲，想出很多好主意，把大同同家梁矿区方圆二十里、三千三百多户一万九千三百多居民整个经济生活的组织工作担负起来，积极地支援了同家梁煤矿生产的跃进，成为矿区有力的“后勤部”。10月间，中央商业部在那里开了一个全国工矿区供应服务工作现场会议，会上介绍了这个商店组织经济生活支援生产的经验，到会同志并深入现场参观访问，感受很深，一致表示要学同家梁，赶同家梁。
    同家梁商店虽然是为煤矿生产和矿工生活服务的，但是，他们创造的经营经验和工作方法，不但适用于其他煤矿区，也适用于钢铁、石油、林业等工矿林区。为什么呢？因为钢铁、石油、林业等工矿林区也跟煤矿区一样，很多都是处在原来荒无人烟或者人口很少的地区，都要平地起家。工矿林区，特别是新的工矿林区，原来没有或者很少有供应服务行业，但是广大职工和他们的家属也跟城市居民一样，吃的、穿的、用的、洗澡、理发、拆洗和缝补衣服、修理自行车等等，缺一不可。因此，工矿林区设立的商店，不能只搞购销，不能只买卖日用百货，不能像城市里的一般商店一样只在柜台里接待顾客，而必须直接地把组织人民——职工和他们的家属的经济生活的担子挑起来。这是党和国家给工矿林区商业职工的一项极其光荣的任务。怎样完成这个任务呢？同家梁商店的经验给我们指出了方向。
    同家梁商店的主要经验是什么呢？
    同家梁商店的主要经验之一，就是依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，组织全体职工在一切工作、一切活动中认真贯彻“一切为了生产，加速社会主义建设”的思想，并且不断地克服各种不正确的思想，使商店职工热情饱满，干劲冲天。同家梁商店的职工们懂得，把商业供应和服务的工作做好了，就可以多出煤，就可以加速社会主义建设。矿工的奋斗目标，就是商店职工服务的目标，以矿工之忧为忧，以矿工之乐为乐。矿工们提出“实现万吨矿（全矿区所有工作面平均月产万吨煤）”的口号，他们就提出“一切为了万吨矿服务”。每一个人都把为万吨矿服务的思想贯彻到自己的工作中，干劲大，信心高，不怕困难，勤勤恳恳。矿工们需要供应手套，他们就把手套送上矿去。矿工们要喝清凉饮料，他们就把清凉饮料送到井里去。矿工们没时间洗补衣服，他们就组织缝补小组。矿工们需要洗澡、理发，他们就开澡堂，开理发馆。矿工们副食品的需要量增加，他们就组织职工家属和附近人民公社种菜、养猪、养鸡等等。矿工们一日三班倒，他们也三班倒。因此，要学习同家梁商店、赶同家梁商店，首先就是学习他们一切为了生产服务、为群众生活服务的业务思想和工作态度。生产需要什么，就供应什么。生产到哪里，就供应到哪里。白天需要，白天供应。晚上需要，晚上供应。麻烦留给自己，方便送给职工。
    同家梁商店的第二条主要经验，就是在一切工作中依靠群众，发动群众，坚持群众路线的工作方法，坚持三参（干部参加劳动，职工参加管理，群众参加监督和管理）的民主管理制度。同家梁商店工作人员总共不过百来人，平均每一百个居民还不到一人，所以，他们除了依靠全体商店职工做好工作以外，还把职工家属组织起来，代销商品、种菜、养猪、养鸡、拆洗衣服、缝补衣服，搞各种副业。同家梁商店的经验证明，职工家属对于帮助办好商业确实有很大的积极性，也有很大的潜力，把他们发动起来，就可以成为一支巨大的供应服务力量。组织职工家属种菜、养猪、养鸡、养鸭、做豆腐等等，这既能扩大货源，又能增加职工家庭收入。组织职工家属缝衣、拆洗，代销部分商品，就可以在不增加商业从业人员的条件下，广泛设立各种商店和服务点，既便利居民购买东西，又能使商店职工集中力量到坑口、到井下供应，组织日夜供应，经营各种必需经营的业务。同时，通过组织职工家属参加商业活动，对他们进行教育，就能提高他们的觉悟，使他们更加关心生产，关心社会主义建设，从而促进家庭和睦，增强四邻友爱，进一步改善人与人之间的关系，有利于生产的发展。
    同家梁商店的第三条主要经验，就是从服务生产、便利群众出发，确定商业网的设置和供应方法。这就是国营商店与代销店结合，固定商店与流动商店结合，井上商店与井下商店结合，分片设摊与登门送货结合，门市营业与业余窗口营业结合。采取了这五种结合供应方法，便可以做到商店网广，供应时间长，适合生产日夜不停的需要，适合职工分散居住的需要，使职工和家属随时可以买到东西，少跑路，不排队，省时间，省人力。同家梁商店的这些经验，对一切工矿林区都是适用的。
    同家梁商店的第四条主要经验，就是主动争取矿区党委的领导和支持。矿区党委把商店看作是煤矿的组成部分，商店党支部把自己看作是煤矿的“后勤部”。工商亲如一家。生产部门要搞好生产，就必须依靠商店供应部分生产资料、劳动保护用品和作好职工生活福利工作。商业部门为职工服务，支援生产，就得主动了解职工生活和生产的需要，主动帮助生产单位解决问题。例如，他们为了支援煤区需要，组织农商协作，帮助附近的人民公社发展副食品生产。这种主动的精神是极其可贵的。同家梁商店的经验证明，工业商业部门密切协作，互相支援，就一定能把生产搞好，实现共同跃进。
    十年来，我国建设和发展了许多工矿林区，在今后的继续跃进中，我们还要建设新的工矿区和林区，还要扩大现有的工矿区和林区。因此，做好工矿林区的商业供应工作，越来越成为商业职工的一个重要任务。我们需要千千万万个“同家梁商店”。从事工矿林区商业工作的职工们，要鼓大劲，立大志，学习同家梁商店，建立自己的“同家梁商店”，把工矿林区人民的经济生活很好地组织起来！
