    On Water Conservancy Construction Sites
    Blasting to Loosen Soil
    The Hanzhong Special District in Shaanxi Province is promoting the experience of using blasting to loosen soil at the Baohe Reservoir construction site. More than 9,000 water conservancy construction sites have adopted the method of blasting to loosen soil, greatly accelerating the progress of construction.
    Adopting the method of blasting to loosen soil is a major reform in water conservancy construction in the Hanzhong Special District. Implementing this method can greatly improve work efficiency, save manpower, and reduce costs. In the past, when building water conservancy projects here, soil was generally loosened by manual digging. Each person could only dig about two cubic meters per day, which required a lot of labor and investment. In particular, after the weather became cold and freezing, manual digging of soil became even more difficult. The Baohe Reservoir construction site originally used manual digging to loosen soil. According to the needs of the project, loosening soil alone would have required more than 720,000 labor days. After they switched to using blasting to loosen soil, from November 25 to December 5, in eleven days, the average person loosened 130 cubic meters of soil per day, increasing work efficiency by 65 times. Based on this work efficiency, the soil loosening work for the entire project can save hundreds of thousands of labor days.
    The Hanzhong Special District produces gunpowder raw materials such as saltpeter and sulfur. The local people have the technology to manufacture gunpowder. The gunpowder used for blasting to loosen soil can be made by themselves. Therefore, the cost of blasting to loosen soil is lower than the cost of using manual labor. At present, more than one million jin of gunpowder have been manufactured throughout the district.

    在水利工地上
    爆破松土
    陕西汉中专区推广褒河水库工地爆破松土的经验，已有九千多处水利工地采用爆破松土办法，大大加快了施工进度。
    采用爆破松土的办法，是汉中专区水利建设施工中的一项重大改革。实行这个办法，可以大大提高工效，节省人力，降低成本。过去这里兴修水利工程时，一般都是人挖松土，每人每天只能挖二立方米左右，而且占用劳力多，投资大，特别是天寒地冻后，人挖松土就有更大困难。褒河水库工地原来用人挖松土，按工程需要，光松土一项就得七十二万多个劳动日。他们改用爆破松土办法后，从11月25日到12月5日的十一天内，平均每人每天松土一百三十立方米，工效提高六十五倍。以这种工效计算，全部工程的松土工作就可节省几十万个劳动日。
    汉中专区出产火硝、硫磺等火药原料，当地群众有制造火药的技术，爆破松土使用的火药可以自造，因此，爆破松土的成本比使用人工松土的成本还低。目前全区已经制造了火药一百多万斤。
