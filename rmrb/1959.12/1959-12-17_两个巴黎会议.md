    Two Paris Conferences
    By Pan Fei, our correspondent

    The annual North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ministerial Council meeting has opened in Paris. In a few days, Eisenhower will also meet with Macmillan, de Gaulle, and Adenauer.

    The current characteristics of the situation within the imperialist bloc are: the economic position of the United States in the capitalist world has been greatly weakened, and its "political prestige" is also constantly declining; with the signing of the Little Free Trade Area treaty, the economic division of Western Europe has become more profound; the struggle for hegemony among Britain, France, and West Germany has intensified, resulting in unresolved differences in their diplomatic strategies. All of this is happening at a time when the socialist camp is united and thriving. Therefore, Western newspapers increasingly emphasize the importance of these two conferences. The "New York Herald Tribune" commented: Eisenhower and Macmillan, de Gaulle, and Adenauer will unify the Western countries' positions and strategies on the issue of an East-West summit meeting to counter the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy. In addition, they will discuss other issues that "affect the unity of the allies." "Eisenhower's visit to Paris will at least lay the foundation for resolving these disputes."

    The main actors in these two conferences will undoubtedly be Eisenhower and his generals and ministers. It seems that the U.S. President and his subordinates have a division of labor: Eisenhower will play a seemingly mild role, attempting to coordinate the diplomatic steps of Western countries to stabilize the imperialist camp; at the same time, he will exert some pressure on Western European countries in private talks, forcing them to compromise on issues that conflict with U.S. interests. As for the American generals and ministers attending the NATO Council meeting, they will be much more unrestrained.

    Everyone knows that the root cause of the so-called "factors affecting allied unity" is the irreconcilable conflict of interests between the monopoly groups of various countries. The two Western European economic groups—the Common Market and the Little Free Trade Area—are just one example. At present, in addition to the increasingly fierce struggle between these two groups, the contradictions between the United States and Western European countries in the economic field have also become significantly sharper. According to the "New York Herald Tribune," since 1953, the rate of growth of industrial production in Western Europe has been 1.7 times faster than that of the United States. In the capitalist world market, the balance of power between the United States and Western European countries has changed increasingly to the disadvantage of the former. In the past year, the U.S.'s various international balance of payments deficits, including the balance of foreign trade payments, reached 3.4 billion U.S. dollars, and this year it will jump to at least 4 billion U.S. dollars. The massive outflow of U.S. gold precisely reflects these changes.

    Against this background, Washington has launched a new offensive against Western European countries. The U.S.'s means of struggle are three: first, demanding repayment of debts. Western Europe owes the United States a total of 5 billion U.S. dollars in loans, with Britain, France, and West Germany being the main debtor countries. Now, the United States, on the grounds that the Western European economy has "improved," is demanding that they accelerate the repayment of these loans. Second, forcing Western European countries to relax their competition and exclusion of U.S. goods. It is from this perspective that the United States is trying to prevent a compromise between the Common Market and the Little Free Trade Area, because if these two customs unions reach an agreement, it would be detrimental to the U.S.'s position in the world market. Third, advocating that the United States and Western European countries jointly raise funds to "aid" underdeveloped countries. The purpose of the U.S.'s proposal, in addition to competing with Britain, France, and other countries for the intermediate zone, is nothing more than to delay the rate of economic development of Western European countries and reduce the pressure on the United States in the world market. Western European countries have their own plans: Britain wants to use foreign capital to increase investment in the Commonwealth countries, but is deeply afraid of the penetration of American and West German economic power; West Germany and Italy want to expand abroad through this form, but are worried that the large outflow of funds will affect the stability of their currencies. Precisely because they distrust each other, the U.S.'s proposal is still in the stage of "agreement in principle" and has not yet been materialized.

    U.S. Undersecretary of State Dillon's recent visit to Western Europe was for the above-mentioned purposes. Dillon's mission was clearly not completed. Now, Eisenhower and the U.S. ministers will continue to work hard to complete this task.

    In addition to diplomatic and economic issues, the Western summit—especially the NATO Council meeting—will focus on military issues. The United States intends to force Western European countries to bear more military expenses and accelerate the merger of NATO armed forces.

    According to official statistics from Western European countries, the proportion of military expenditure to gross national product is: Britain 8.4%, France 8.6%, West Germany 4.3%, Italy 4.3%, Norway 4%, Netherlands 6.5%, Belgium 3.9%, Denmark 3.6%, while the United States is 11.5%. Apart from West Germany, some small countries may be identified as the main targets for increasing military spending. But the general sentiment of these countries is exactly the opposite of that of the United States. A week ago, the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of the Belgian Parliament unanimously passed a resolution: Belgium's tasks for NATO must be greatly reduced, and the troops stationed in West Germany should be gradually withdrawn.

    On the issue of merging NATO armed forces, the United States will first encounter resistance from France, because de Gaulle has been seizing on this issue to blackmail Washington.

    The two Paris conferences may reach some compromises on individual issues, but it is very obvious that Eisenhower and his subordinates will find it difficult to resolve these disputes that "affect allied unity." The United States' attempt to use NATO to poison the international atmosphere exposes the ugly drama of fake peace that it has been playing recently.

    两个巴黎会议
    本报记者  潘非
    一年一度的北大西洋集团部长理事会会议，已在巴黎揭幕。几天以后，艾森豪威尔又将同麦克米伦、戴高乐、阿登纳举行会议。
    当前帝国主义集团内部形势的特点是：美国在资本主义世界中的经济地位大为削弱，它的“政治威望”也在不断降低；随着小自由贸易区条约的签订，西欧经济上的分裂已更趋深刻；英、法、西德争夺霸权的斗争有增无已，从而使得它们在外交策略上的分歧，迄未消除。而这一切，又都发生在社会主义阵营团结一致、欣欣向荣的时候。因而，西方报纸便愈益强调这两个会议的重要性。“纽约先驱论坛报”是这样评价的：艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦、戴高乐、阿登纳将统一西方国家在有关东西方最高级会议问题上的立场和策略，以便和苏联的和平外交政策相对抗。除此以外，他们还将讨论“影响盟国团结”的其他问题。“艾森豪威尔在巴黎的访问任务至少将为解决这些纷争打下基础。”
    在这两个会议上充当主角的，无疑是艾森豪威尔和他的将军与部长们。看来，美国总统和他的部属有所分工：艾森豪威尔会扮演一个貌似温厚的角色，他企图协调西方国家的外交步调，以稳定帝国主义阵营；同时，将在私下的会谈中，对西欧国家略施压力，迫使它们在同美国利害冲突的问题上让步。至于出席北大西洋集团的理事会会议的美国将军和部长们，将会放肆得多。
    谁都知道，所谓“影响盟国团结”根源，是各国垄断集团之间在利害关系上的难以克服的冲突。西欧两个经济集团——共同市场和小自由贸易区——只是一个例子而已。目前，除了这两个集团的斗争日益激烈以外，美国同西欧国家在经济领域内的矛盾，又显著地尖锐起来了。根据“纽约先驱论坛报”的报道，从1953年到现在，西欧工业生产增长的速度，比美国快一点七倍。在资本主义世界市场上，美国同西欧国家的力量对比，发生了对前者愈来愈加不利的变化。美国在去年一年中，包括对外贸易支付平衡在内的各种国际收支的赤字达三十四亿美元，而今年至少将跃升到四十亿美元。美国黄金大量外流，正是集中地反映了这些变化。
    在这一背景下，华盛顿开始发动了对西欧国家的新的攻势。美国的斗争手段有三：第一是讨债。西欧拖欠美国的借款，共达五十亿美元，英、法、西德是主要的债务国。现在，美国以西欧经济“好转”为理由，要求它们加速偿还这些借款。第二是迫使西欧国家放松对美国商品的竞争和排挤。也正是从这一点考虑出发，美国竭力阻止共同市场和小自由贸易区之间的妥协，因为如果这两个关税同盟达成协议，对于美国在世界市场上的处境是不利的。第三是倡议美国与西欧国家共同集资“援助”不发达国家。美国提出这一建议的目的，除了同英、法等国争夺中间地带以外，无非想从此延缓西欧国家经济发展的速度，减轻美国在世界市场上所受到的压力。而西欧国家则各有打算：英国想利用外资来增加对联邦国家的投资，但又深恐美国和西德经济实力的渗入；西德和意大利则想通过这一形式来对外扩张，但又担心大量资金外流会影响币值的稳定。正因为彼此互相猜疑，美国的建议迄今还处于“原则上同意”阶段，尚未具体化。
    美国副国务卿狄龙最近访问西欧，就是为了上述的几个目的。狄龙的使命显然没有完成。现在，艾森豪威尔和美国的部长们，将继续为完成这一任务而努力。
    除了外交问题和经济问题以外，西方首脑会议——特别是北大西洋集团理事会会议，将着重讨论军事问题。美国打算迫使西欧国家负担更多的军事费用，并加速北大西洋集团武装力量的合并。
    根据西欧国家官方的统计，军事费用占国民总产值的比重是：英国8.4％，法国8.6％，西德4.3％，意大利4.3％，挪威4％，荷兰6.5％，比利时3.9％，丹麦3.6％，而美国则为11.5％。除了西德以外，一些小国将可能被物色为增加军费的主要对象。但这些国家的一般情绪，恰恰同美国相反。一个星期以前，比利时议会的外交与国防委员会一致通过决议：比利时对北大西洋集团所负担的任务必须大大缩减，驻在西德的军队应逐步撤回。
    在北大西洋集团武装力量合并的问题上，美国将首先遇到来自法国的阻力，因为戴高乐一直抓住这个问题对华盛顿进行要挟。
    两个巴黎会议，可能在个别问题上取得某些妥协，但十分明显的是，艾森豪威尔和他的部属们将很难解决“影响盟国团结”的这些纠纷。美国企图利用北大西洋集团来毒化国际气氛的努力，揭穿了它最近一直在扮演的假和平的丑剧。
