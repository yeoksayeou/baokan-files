Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Foreign Minister Chen Yi wrote to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, lodging a strong protest against the large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese activities and putting forward three proposals for a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese problem:
\t1. The two governments should immediately exchange instruments of ratification of the treaty on the question of dual nationality and, at the same time, discuss and stipulate measures for the implementation of the treaty; 2. Earnestly protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality or choose Indonesian nationality but have not been approved; 3. For those overseas Chinese who are displaced or unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia, our government is prepared to arrange for them to return to China to participate in construction, and hopes that the Indonesian government will repatriate them to China in batches and ensure their safety on the way home.

The full text of the letter is as follows:

Your Excellency Dr. Subandrio, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, Jakarta:

\tDuring your visit to China in October this year, I had the honor of having friendly talks with you. As you will recall, in our talks, in addition to international issues of common concern to both countries and the issue of strengthening friendly cooperation between the two countries, we also specifically exchanged views on the issue of overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia. Subsequently, in the joint communiqué issued by us on October 11, 1959, we also put forward principles for properly handling the issue of overseas Chinese in the spirit of friendship between the two countries. Unfortunately, since then, situations have occurred in Indonesia that seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and are extremely detrimental to the friendship between the two countries. This situation cannot but make the Chinese government feel concerned and worried. Therefore, I believe it is necessary to write to you to put forward the Chinese government's views on changing this situation and safeguarding the friendly relations between the two countries.
\tConstantly consolidating and developing the friendship between China and Indonesia is the basic starting point for the Chinese government in handling all issues in our bilateral relations. Our two countries have always been friendly, and since the Bandung Conference, our friendly relations have seen new and significant development. Our two countries have no fundamental conflicts of interest, but both have suffered from imperialist aggression and interference, and both face the enormous task of developing the economy and improving the people's living standards. Therefore, it is in the fundamental interests of the people of both countries to continue to support each other and strengthen friendly cooperation, and it is also an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world.
\tThe issue of overseas Chinese is a problem left over from long-term historical development. The Chinese government has consistently strived to work with the Indonesian government to resolve this issue rationally. On April 22, 1955, our two governments signed the "Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality." Subsequently, the premiers of the two countries exchanged notes on June 3, 1955, on the implementation of this treaty. Two months ago, the foreign ministers of the two countries issued a joint communiqué, putting forward clear principles on how to enable the economic strength of overseas Chinese to continue to play a beneficial role in Indonesia's economic development. Prior to this, His Excellency President Sukarno also announced in his political manifesto of August 17, 1959: "Non-native forces and capital that have settled in Indonesia, agree and are prepared to help implement the work cabinet's program will be given appropriate status and opportunities in our activities to increase industrial and agricultural production." He also said: "To realize this plan, there needs to be an atmosphere conducive to cooperation. Therefore, everyone involved should avoid taking any action that might damage this atmosphere of cooperation." If the various principles and methods already agreed upon by both parties and the policies clearly announced by His Excellency President Sukarno were earnestly implemented and observed, the issue of overseas Chinese could have been gradually resolved rationally, and the friendly relations between the two countries could have been further developed. However, the actual situation is not like this. In recent times, a large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese wave has been stirred up in Indonesia. Forces attempting to undermine the friendship between our two countries have taken advantage of Indonesia's decree prohibiting foreign small retailers from doing business in areas outside the first and second-level autonomous regions and state capitals, concentrating their attacks on overseas Chinese, and even going further than this decree, forcibly relocating overseas Chinese from the aforementioned areas, damaging the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and infringing upon the personal safety of overseas Chinese. As a result, large numbers of overseas Chinese have lost their livelihoods and become displaced. In the process of forced relocation, force has even been used, causing bloodshed. China has always been friendly to Indonesia and has always done its best to provide support when Indonesia encounters difficulties. However, overseas Chinese in Indonesia are now being treated as nationals of hostile countries and subjected to extremely rude treatment. To cooperate with the various persecutions of overseas Chinese, some newspapers and periodicals in Indonesia have published a large number of anti-China remarks, even insulting the beloved leaders of the Chinese people. A part of the influential forces in Indonesia dare to carry out activities to undermine the friendship between our two countries so frantically after His Excellency President Sukarno and the Indonesian government have repeatedly announced a friendly policy towards China, which is by no means accidental. The Chinese government lodges a serious protest against this intolerable situation. After the Chinese government has repeatedly called the attention of the Indonesian government to this, the trend of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities has not only not been stopped, but has continued to expand, which cannot but cause great regret to the Chinese government.
\tIn order to safeguard the friendly relations between our two countries and prevent those forces that are hostile to the friendship between our two countries from taking advantage of the situation, the Chinese government believes that the two governments should immediately take measures to comprehensively resolve the issue of overseas Chinese existing between our two countries. Based on its consistent position on the issue of overseas Chinese, the Chinese government puts forward the following suggestions:
\tFirst, the Chinese government has always believed that it is unreasonable for overseas Chinese to have dual nationality. Many overseas Chinese have resided in Indonesia for generations, and they have already integrated with the Indonesian people in social and economic life. The Chinese government is willing to see these overseas Chinese choose Indonesian nationality based on the principle of voluntariness. Once they acquire Indonesian nationality, they will of course be loyal to Indonesia and at the same time, of course, enjoy the rights of citizens of that country without any discrimination. It is beneficial for overseas Chinese to join the nationality of their country of residence, both for themselves and for their country of residence. Therefore, the Chinese government has always hoped that the treaty on the question of dual nationality signed between our two countries can come into effect and be implemented as soon as possible. As early as December 30, 1957 the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China decided to ratify this treaty. Now, the Chinese government suggests that the two governments immediately exchange the instruments of ratification of the "Treaty between the People's Republic of the China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality," and at the same time, in accordance with the exchange of notes between the premiers of the two countries on June 3, 1955, send representatives to form a joint committee to discuss and stipulate relevant measures for the implementation of this treaty.
\tSecond, among the overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia, some will voluntarily retain Chinese nationality, and some will choose Indonesian nationality but have not been approved. The Chinese government hopes that the government of Indonesia, in accordance with Article 11 of the treaty on the question of dual nationality signed between the two countries and the joint communiqué of the foreign ministers of the two countries, will earnestly protect the legitimate rights and interests of these overseas Chinese, and stop all discrimination and persecution against them. The Chinese government will continue to encourage these overseas Chinese to respect the laws of the Indonesian government, not to participate in local political activities, to strive to make contributions to Indonesia's economic and cultural development, and to live in friendship with the Indonesian people. Of course, the Chinese government hopes that the laws of the Indonesian government will treat all foreigners equally, and will not discriminate against the nationals of friendly countries, or even be used as a tool to persecute overseas Chinese.
\tThird, for those overseas Chinese who are displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia, the Chinese government is prepared to arrange for them to live in China according to their wishes to return to their country, so that they have the opportunity to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. The Chinese government hopes that when the Indonesian government repatriates these overseas Chinese, it will also respect their voluntariness, not adopt compulsory methods, allow them to sell their property and take back the funds they have obtained, and ensure their safety on the way home. In order to facilitate the orderly resettlement of these returning overseas Chinese by the Chinese government, the Chinese government also hopes that the Indonesian government will adopt the method of repatriating them to China in batches.
\tThe above suggestions clearly show that the Chinese government is willing to thoroughly resolve the issue of overseas Chinese existing between our two countries and is willing to do everything possible to prevent the friendly relations between our two countries from being undermined. The Chinese government suggests that the two governments immediately appoint representatives to discuss the above suggestions of the Chinese government and any suggestions that the Indonesian government may put forward for the same purpose. I am eagerly awaiting your reply.

\tWith the highest respect.

\t\t\t\t\t\tChen Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
\t\t\t\t\t\tBeijing, December 9, 1959

    陈毅外长写信给印度尼西亚苏班德里约外长
    严重抗议大规模的反华排华活动  提出三点建议全面解决华侨问题
    一、两国政府立即交换关于双重国籍问题条约的批准书，同时讨论和规定实施这个条约的办法；二、切实保护自愿保留中国国籍或者选择印度尼西亚国籍而未获批准的华侨的正当权利和利益  三、对于流离失所或不愿继续留居的华侨，我国政府准备安排他们回国参加建设希望印度尼西亚政府分期分批遣送他们归国，并保证他们归国途中的安全
    新华社11日讯　中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅在12月9日就两国通过外交谈判全盘解决在印度尼西亚的华侨问题，尤其是关于最近的排华事件的处理写信给印度尼西亚共和国外交部长苏班德里约博士。信件的全文如下：雅加达印度尼西亚共和国外交部长苏班德里约博士阁下阁下：
    今年10月，在阁下访问中国的时候，我曾经荣幸地同阁下进行过友好的会谈。阁下谅必记得，在我们的会谈中，除了两国共同关心的国际问题和加强两国友好合作的问题以外，我们还特别就定居在印度尼西亚的华侨问题，交换了意见。接着我们在1959年10月11日发表的联合公报中，又根据两国友好的精神，提出了正确处理华侨问题的原则。不幸的是，在这以后，在印度尼西亚发生了严重损害华侨的正当权利和利益、极其不利于两国友谊的情况。这种情况不能不使中国政府感到关切和忧虑。因此，我认为有必要写信给你，提出中国政府关于改变这种情况和维护两国友好关系的意见。
    不断地巩固和发展中国和印度尼西亚之间的友谊，是中国政府处理我们两国关系中一切问题的基本出发点。我们两国从来就是友好的，从万隆会议以来，我们的友好关系又有了新的、显著的发展。我们两国没有根本的利害冲突，却同样遭受着帝国主义的侵略和干涉，同样面临着发展经济、提高人民生活水平的巨大任务。因此，我们两国继续互相支持，加强友好合作，正是两国人民根本利益的所在，也是维护亚洲和世界和平的重要因素。
    华侨问题是由于长期历史的发展而遗留下来的问题。中国政府一贯努力争取同印度尼西亚政府合理解决这个问题。1955年4月22日，我们两国政府签订了“中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约”。接着，两国总理在1955年6月3日就这个条约的实施办法进行了换文。两个月以前，两国外长又发表联合公报，对于如何使华侨的经济力量继续发挥有益于印度尼西亚经济发展的作用，提出了明确的原则。在此以前，苏加诺总统阁下在1959年8月17日的政治宣言中也宣布：“已经在印度尼西亚安顿下来、同意而且还准备帮助实行工作内阁的纲领的非本国的力量和资金，在我们增加工农业生产的活动中都将得到适当的地位和机会。”他还说：“为实现这个打算，需要有一个有利于合作的气氛。因此，每个有关的人都应当避免采取任何可能损害这种合作气氛的行动。”如果双方早已协议的各项原则和办法以及苏加诺总统阁下明确宣布的政策得到切实的执行和遵守，华侨问题本来可以逐步求得合理的解决，两国的友好关系也可以进一步发展。但是，实际的情况却并不是这样。最近一个时期以来，在印度尼西亚掀起了大规模反华和排华的浪潮。力图破坏我们两国友谊的势力，利用印度尼西亚禁止外国小零售商在一级和二级自治区和州首府以外的地区经商的法令，集中打击华侨，甚至比这个法令更进一步，强迫华侨迁出上述的地区，使华侨的正当权利和利益遭到损害，使华侨的人身安全受到侵犯，结果大批华侨丧失生计，流离失所。在迫迁的过程中，还竟然使用了武力，造成流血事件。中国一贯对印度尼西亚友好，在印度尼西亚遇到困难的时候，总是尽力给予支援。但是，现在华侨在印度尼西亚却被当作是敌对国家的侨民，受到极其粗暴的待遇。为了配合对华侨的种种迫害，印度尼西亚的某些报刊更发表了大量敌视中国的言论，甚至污辱中国人民敬爱的领袖。印度尼西亚的一部分有影响的势力在苏加诺总统阁下和印度尼西亚政府一再宣布对中国友好的政策以后，竟敢于这样猖狂地进行破坏我们两国友谊的活动，这决不是偶然的。对于这种令人不能容忍的情况，中国政府提出严重的抗议。在中国政府一再提请印度尼西亚政府注意以后，反华和排华的趋势不仅没有制止，反而继续扩大，中国政府不能不感到极大的遗憾。
    为了维护我们两国的友好关系，使那些敌视我们两国友谊的势力无隙可乘，中国政府认为，两国政府应当立即采取措施，全面解决存在于我们两国之间的华侨问题。中国政府根据在华侨问题上的一贯立场，提出下列建议：
    第一、中国政府一向认为，华侨具有双重国籍是不合理的。许多华侨世世代代居留在印度尼西亚，他们在社会经济生活中，已经同印度尼西亚人民融合在一起。中国政府愿意看到这些华侨能够根据自愿的原则选择印度尼西亚国籍。他们一旦取得印度尼西亚的国籍，当然效忠于印度尼西亚，同时也当然享受这个国家的公民权利，而不受任何歧视。华侨加入侨居国的国籍，对于他们自己和对于侨居国来说，都是有利的。因此，中国政府一直希望，我们两国签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约能够早日生效和付诸实施。早在1957年12月30日，中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会就已经决定批准这个条约。现在，中国政府建议，两国政府立即交换“中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约”的批准书，同时根据两国总理在1955年6月3日的换文，派出代表组成联合委员会，讨论和规定有关实施这个条约的办法。
    第二、在印度尼西亚居留的华侨中，会有一部分人自愿保留中国国籍，也会有一部分人选择印度尼西亚国籍而未获批准。中国政府希望，印度尼西亚政府按照两国签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约的第十一条和两国外交部长的联合公报，切实保护这些华侨的正当权利和利益，制止对他们的一切歧视和迫害。中国政府将继续勉励这些华侨尊重印度尼西亚政府的法令，不参加当地的政治活动，对印度尼西亚的经济和文化发展努力作出贡献，同印度尼西亚人民友好相处。当然，中国政府希望印度尼西亚政府的法令将对所有外侨一视同仁，而不使友好国家的侨民反而受到歧视，或者甚至被用来作为迫害华侨的工具。
    第三、对于那些流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚的华侨，中国政府准备根据他们的回国的志愿，安排他们在国内生活，使他们有机会参加祖国的社会主义建设。中国政府希望，印度尼西亚政府在遣送这些华侨回国的时候，也尊重他们的自愿，不采取强制的办法，允许他们变卖自己的产业并且带回所得的资金，保证他们在归国途中的安全。为了便于中国政府有秩序地安置这些归国华侨，中国政府还希望印度尼西亚政府采取分期分批遣送他们回国的办法。
    上述建议清楚地表明，中国政府愿意彻底解决存在于我们两国之间的华侨问题，愿意尽一切努力使我们两国的友好关系不被破坏。中国政府建议，两国政府立即指派代表对中国政府的上述建议和印度尼西亚政府为了同样的目的可能提出的任何建议，进行商谈。我迫切地等待着阁下的答复。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
                    中华人民共和国外交部长　陈　毅
                                      1959年12月9日于北京
