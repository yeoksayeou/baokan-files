    The dream that farmers have yearned for over thousands of years, "lighting lamps without oil, farming fields without oxen," is becoming a reality in Xingnong People's Commune, Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province. Modern agricultural machinery is making this rural area, which has been silent for thousands of years, seethe with activity. The roar of tractors drowns out the shouts of oxen and horses, and male and female commune members drive and cooperate with machinery, working easily and happily; at night, thousands of lights shine, interweaving and reflecting each other. The commune members sing loudly: "Land reform, the poor turned over; cooperativization, the roots of wealth were deeply planted; mechanization, the land turned over; communization, happiness has arrived."
    Xingnong People's Commune was established on August 21 last year, merging thirteen advanced agricultural production cooperatives. The commune currently has twelve management districts, with a cultivated area of 184,546 mu, 2,872 households, 13,134 people, 4,404 male and female laborers, and 1,916 draft animals. Each male laborer cultivates an average of 62 mu of land, and each animal bears an average burden of 96 mu. With the help of the state, this commune has taken a big step towards agricultural mechanization. It currently has 40 combined tractors (equivalent to 68.2 standard units) and 87 sets (pieces) of tractor-drawn farm implements of nine types. The mechanized area reaches more than 50%. About one-third of the main farm work, from plowing, sowing, weeding to autumn harvesting, threshing, and transportation, is already done by machinery. People's communization plus mechanization are like two powerful wings, enabling Xingnong People's Commune to spread its wings and soar for ten thousand miles.
    Xingnong People's Commune is located at 48 degrees north latitude, and the frost-free period is only about 125 days a year. How to get the grain in this short period of time? This has always been a serious problem. Although there is a large area of fertile land here, the lack of land and labor force has brought great difficulties to production, especially during the period of individual peasant small-scale economy. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, land reform was carried out here, as in all parts of the country, and the road of mutual assistance and cooperation was taken. The collective strength of the organized has greatly developed production. Especially after cooperativization, the production landscape here has undergone great changes. Cultivation has become more meticulous year by year, and yields have increased year by year. But it still cannot fundamentally overcome nature. Therefore, further developing the strength of cooperative mutual assistance and using modern production tools to carry out technical transformation of agriculture has become an urgent demand of the broad masses of farmers here. The establishment of advanced agricultural production cooperatives began to provide conditions for agricultural mechanization: advanced cooperatives organized labor more reasonably, accumulated more funds than primary cooperatives, and the land plots were larger, which made it possible for them to start using mechanical farming. From 1956, when the state's tractor station began to cultivate on behalf of the advanced agricultural production cooperatives here, it entered a new stage of using modern production tools to carry out technical transformation of agriculture. Agriculture, which has been produced with curved plows for thousands of years, has entered the era of "iron oxen". In 1956, Xingye Advanced Cooperative (now a management area of the commune) used the tractor station's threshing machine to thresh wheat for the first time. In five days, the wheat that used to take the whole cooperative more than a month to thresh was threshed; they also asked the tractor station's tractors to deep plow 600 mu of land. This year, their autumn harvest work and preparations for next year's production were earlier than in previous years. The commune members praised the power of mechanical operations. However, because one set of production tools was managed by two units, the tractor station managed the machinery after all, and there was a layer between them and the farmers of the advanced cooperative, so uncoordinated phenomena often occurred in the production process. When machinery was needed, it could not be called in immediately, and sometimes it was not needed when it was called in, which had a great impact on production. In order to solve this contradiction, a method was further adopted whereby the tractor station leased agricultural machinery to advanced cooperatives, also called the "state-owned commune (advanced cooperative) operated" method. This form solved the problems existing in the tractor station's cultivation, making cultivation convenient and timely, and significantly improving the utilization rate of tractors. However, new contradictions were exposed in later development: on the one hand, the advanced cooperatives always wanted the tractors to do more work, and sometimes they paid less attention to the care and maintenance of the tractors; on the other hand, the tractor drivers only wanted to reduce consumption and save fuel, and did not consider the quality of the work enough, which also affected production. So it developed into the form of "commune (advanced cooperative) owned and commune (advanced cooperative) operated", and the state transferred tractors down and sold them to advanced cooperatives. In this way, after the unification of mechanical ownership and use rights, not only were the contradictions mentioned above immediately resolved, promoting the development of production, but also paving the way for accelerating agricultural mechanization by relying on the strength of the masses. At that time, in terms of production alone, Xingye Advanced Cooperative produced 111,000 jin more grain than neighboring advanced cooperatives with the same conditions in 1957, saving more than 10,000 jin of horse feed, and the unit area yield per mu increased by 22% compared with 1956.
    With the step-by-step development of the productive forces of the advanced cooperatives and the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the farmers, especially the implementation of the general line in 1958, the all-round great development and great leap forward of production, the advanced cooperatives on the one hand fully played their role in the development of production; on the other hand, they began to feel that they were not suitable in terms of organizational scale and scope of activities. First of all, tractors were restricted by land boundaries, and they could not be used in mechanized farming. The Shoul in and Xingye advanced cooperatives occupied more than 150 mu of land due to the mutual compression of land by vehicle operations at the head of the field. The ridge head still seemed short during cultivation, and the land plots still seemed small, which restricted the further play of mechanical efficiency. According to the requirements of the vehicle, the ridge length was more suitable at 1,000 to 1,500 meters, but at that time, the land plots for mechanical operation were only 100 meters long, which caused the tractor to run idle too much, do less work, and consume more fuel. The idle running time of the Shoulin Advanced Cooperative accounted for about 20%, which urgently needed to be resolved.
    Similarly, within the scope of the advanced cooperatives, it has already begun to be felt that large, medium, and small vehicles cannot be well coordinated. Xingye Advanced Cooperative has two tractors, both of which are 25-horsepower small tractors. It is very easy to use them for transportation or miscellaneous work, but it is not as deep and efficient as large and medium-sized vehicles for plowing. Moreover, this type of small tire vehicle is not very easy to use for cultivation in muddy land, causing great inconvenience; on the other hand, in terms of agricultural tool matching, it is not possible to achieve the effect of one tool for multiple purposes. If a vehicle is equipped with a complete set of agricultural tools, the advanced cooperative cannot use it all, which costs a lot of money, stockpiles funds, and wastes agricultural tools. If fewer are equipped, it is not enough, and the vehicle cannot play its role well.
    Also, relying on the advanced cooperatives to accumulate funds seems insufficient, "taking care of the front and not the back," "having money to buy horses but not money to buy saddles," it is not possible to buy a complete set of tractors. With tractors, the whole set of agricultural tools that are dragged behind cannot be afforded at once.
    At this time, the leap-forward development in all aspects made the strength of the advanced cooperatives seem somewhat weak, and the scope of activities was restricted. Not only was it not suitable for the greater development of agricultural mechanization, but there were also many of the same problems that could not be solved in every aspect such as large-scale water conservancy, large-scale industry, and large-scale diversified operations. For example, the reservoir of Zhongxing Advanced Cooperative had to be built within the territory of Qianyuan Advanced Cooperative, but the two sides brewed several times, but due to insufficient strength, it was not built. Restrictions were also placed on large-scale industry, large-scale diversified operations, basic construction, and resource utilization. It was also not easy to better implement the principle of adapting to local conditions in the rational arrangement of crops. This, to a certain extent, hindered the greater development of productive forces.
    As early as the autumn of 1957, Xingye, Yuanjian, and Quanye Advanced Cooperatives felt from cooperation and from the process of realizing mechanization that the commune was small and the strength was weak. If they wanted to further develop production, if they wanted agricultural mechanization, the only way out was to establish large communes. And there had been many brewing of merging communes, but how to merge, what kind of organizational form was good, and what was the development production policy, were not clear. At this time, Chairman Mao's instructions on the People's Commune, like a beacon, illuminated people's path forward, and Xingnong People's Commune was established.

    Great Development of Productive Forces
    Once Xingnong People's Commune was established, its characteristics of being large and public not only immediately greatly developed the rural productive forces, but also opened up a broad road for agricultural mechanization.
    After the establishment of the commune, it quickly adjusted 65 interspersed plots, exchanged 4,875 mu of land, and eliminated 3,700 empty spaces and field edges between plots. The land was connected into pieces, which facilitated tractor operations, which improved mechanical efficiency. With the same vehicle, in the past, when operating on a 480-meter-long plot, the amount of work completed was 112 mu, and the cost per mu was 33 cents. Now, when operating on a 1,400-meter-long plot, the amount of work completed can be 203 mu, and the cost per mu is reduced to 19 cents. Due to the connection of land and the elimination of empty spaces and field edges, the cultivated land has increased by 2,925 mu.
    The commune implemented the "commune-owned district (management district) operated" agricultural machinery system, that is, the agricultural machinery is owned by the commune and handed over to the management district for use, which facilitates the matching of machinery, unified adjustment, and full play of the role of agricultural machinery. According to the performance of the machinery and the needs of the operation, the commune matched large, medium, and small vehicles to each management district so that they can cooperate with each other and several processes can be carried out at the same time: large tracked vehicles plow the land in the front, and small tire vehicles can follow closely behind to harrow and rake; large tracked vehicles sow in the front, and small tire vehicles then compact and level the land, which is twice as efficient as using small tire vehicles alone, and the quality is better. This year, during the wheat harvest and threshing, the commune uniformly adjusted four threshing machines and threshed them in rotation, giving full play to the role of the threshing machines. The 40,500 mu of wheat in the whole commune were basically threshed by threshing machines, and each threshing machine was more than twice as efficient as in the advanced cooperative.
    The all-round great development of commune production has greatly increased income, and it can also uniformly plan funds and use them centrally, which enables the commune to afford more agricultural machinery, which has received great results. In this year, 324,000 yuan of funds were accumulated for agricultural mechanization (excluding the accumulation part distributed in this year's autumn harvest), and more than 20 tractors and a large number of tractor-drawn agricultural tools were added in less than a year. Some large and expensive agricultural tools, such as combine harvesters, can also be bought. Before communization, Shoulin Management District had three tractors. After communization, they were allocated two more tractors and nine types of 12 tractor-drawn agricultural tools. If these agricultural machines were purchased in the advanced cooperative, the value would account for about 50% of the total annual income of the advanced cooperative. Now the commune members say: "Without feeling the money spent, the tractor drove in."
    After the establishment of the commune, they had a tractor repair factory, and in accordance with the large-scale development of mechanization, they organized four mobile workers and assigned them to each management district to avoid the impact of small problems on the operation of the machinery in the repair factory. The commune also uniformly allocated technicians to make the new and old tractor drivers cooperate with each other. It also expanded the original amateur tractor school and trained 171 technical personnel for the commune.
    One of the most prominent changes brought about by communization plus mechanization is the leap-forward development of rural productive forces. Taking the commune's tractor driver Zhang Zhixian as an example, the 45-horsepower tractor he drives, in the case of insufficient tractor-drawn agricultural tools, the main farm work he has done this year, if replaced by old-fashioned agricultural tools, the same person would have to drive four horses and work for eleven years. When planting wheat this spring, Zhang Zhixian drove a tractor, pulling a seeder, and together with two farm tool operators, sowed more than 220 mu a day. If replaced by horse-drawn agricultural tools, a plow, six horses, and four people would only sow 20 mu a day, and it would take eleven days to complete the sowing. Zhang Zhixian said proudly: "Now the time I spend smoking a cigarette is enough for the curved plow to work for a day." The commune unifies, arranges, and rationally organizes the manpower and animal power freed up by mechanical work, which has led to the huge change that agricultural employment is gradually reduced, but cultivation can become more and more meticulous. The commune invests most of the labor force freed up by mechanical operations into farmland processing and increasing measures, so that this place with more land and fewer people can also well implement the "Eight-Character Constitution", which has won the opportunity and seized the initiative on the agricultural production front, and achieved "four in time" (plowing, sowing, summer cultivation, and harvest in time). Last autumn, when the commune was just established, the combination of machinery, horses, and cattle deep plowed more than 73% of the total area, which changed the past situation of not having the strength to carry out deep plowing. At the same time, it also built 580,000 cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects. This spring's sowing took seven and a half days to complete the sowing of 40,500 mu of wheat, which is an unprecedented speed. The large fields were sown in half a month this year, about 20 days earlier than in previous years, completely in time, and rational close planting was implemented, planting was more meticulous and the quality was better. Even during the tense spring plowing, the commune organized more than 1,500 laborers, 200 large carts, and 800 horses to carry out large-scale fertilizer accumulation and manure delivery. This year's fertilization area accounted for 75%, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu reached 4,200 jin, an increase of 36.8% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958. This year's summer cultivation is really like embroidery, and the speed is also fast. In just 40 days, four hoeings and four trips were completed, and not a single mu of land was left barren. Here, the old man in the sky this year did not adjust the wind and rain. It had not rained through from September last year to May this year for eight months. In the autumn, there was continuous rain and waterlogging, but because the commune organized two nationwide field inspections, seedling replanting and drought resistance struggles when the seedlings emerged in the spring, and because the land was deeply plowed by agricultural machinery, the drought resistance and flood resistance were strong, and the crops were still far better than in previous years. During the most tense "autumn harvest" of the year, as soon as the wheat was loaded into the yard, the tractor took the tractor-drawn plow and deeply plowed the land of the wheat field to prepare for the continued leap forward next year; in the yard, the tractor took the threshing machine, rumbling day and night to beat the wheat; smoke and dust were everywhere on the road, and the tractor took the trailer to transport the wheat into the warehouse. Even in such a busy season, because of agricultural machinery, the commune members freed up their hands before the harvest of autumn crops, and started potatoes, cut millet, pulled rice beans, dried vegetables, finished miscellaneous work, and prepared for harvesting large fields. Due to the use of agricultural machinery for cultivation, the sowing was completed in advance, and various measures were added, which promoted the early maturity of crops and avoided the threat of early frost.

    Great Increase in Grain Yield
    The direct effect of the leap-forward development of the productive forces of this commune is: the astonishing leap forward in agricultural production for two consecutive years, as the commune members said: "Communalization plus mechanization, people, machinery, horses, and cattle are powerful, the Eight-Character Constitution has blossomed, and grain production has greatly increased." In the first year after communization, 1959, the total agricultural output value increased by 40.6% compared with 1958, each agricultural laborer produced 17,632 jin of grain, and each working day produced an average of 93 jin of grain. After communization plus mechanization, especially the increase in the grain commodity rate is more significant. In 1959, the grain commodity rate reached 67.3% of the total output, and each agricultural population handed over 2,875 jin of commodity grain to the state, an increase of 51.24% compared with 1958 and 130% compared with 1957. Here is a comparison of the increase in grain output and commodity rate of Xingnong People's Commune in three years:

    Diversified Operations Leap Forward
    The large amount of manpower and animal power saved by mechanized production, coupled with the various public welfare undertakings established by the People's Commune, liberated a large number of female laborers from the family. These women cooperated with agricultural machinery to work, and their labor efficiency was greatly improved, which enabled them to free up 1,000 strong laborers, 47 horse carts, and 312 horses from the agricultural front to establish commune industry from scratch, engage in large-scale diversified operations, large-scale basic construction, and short-distance transportation, expand the scope of operations, and promote the all-round development and all-round leap forward of the commune's economy. The commune operated the tractor repair factory of the original tractor station, and established 19 places such as small iron and wood factories, power plants, machinery repair shops, and soil fertilizer factories. It held 120 small factories such as rice making, milk refining, flour making, winemaking, weaving, and clothing. The industrial network of communes, management districts, and production teams has basically been formed. The total output value this year can reach more than 495,000 yuan. They have also built "chicken farms" and "livestock farms" to meet the needs of the great development of animal husbandry. Here, the old yellow cattle have always been an important animal power second only to horses in agricultural production, but with the increase of agricultural machinery, it has retreated to an auxiliary position. The commune has extracted 60 yellow cattle and "transferred" them to specialize in producing milk to supply market needs. The whole commune now has 9,700 pigs, which can reach one per person by the end of the year. 4,000 heads have been sold this year, and 1,000 heads can be sold by the end of the year (this year, an average of more than two people in the commune sell one pig to the state). The total output value of this year's industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline industries can reach more than 6,965,000 yuan, an increase of 68% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958.
    With the all-round great development and great leap forward of production, on the one hand, the commune members strongly demand to increase public accumulation and buy tractors, motors, and many other things to further realize agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification. This year, they will take out more than 1,632,000 yuan as public accumulation, accounting for 23% of the total income. At present, China's domestically produced "Dongfanghong" tractors and motors are being transported here one after another. On the other hand, the income of commune members has also greatly increased compared with the past, and production has been further improved. This year, each commune member will receive an average of 100 yuan in collective distribution, an increase of 40.5% compared with 1958 and 14.2% compared with 1957. Adding the income from individual household sideline industries of the commune members, the average income of each commune member this year is 134 yuan and 60 cents. The commune members happily said: "Our commune is now a big family with a big business, and the days are getting more and more prosperous. We are really stepping on a ladder to go upstairs - rising step by step."

    千百年来农民渴望的“点灯不用油，耕田不用牛”的理想，正在黑龙江省拜泉县兴农人民公社变为现实。现代化的农业机械使这个沉寂了千百年的农村沸腾起来了。拖拉机的吼声压倒了吆喝牛马声，男女社员们驾驶和配合着机械，轻松愉快的劳动着；入夜，灯火万千，交互辉映。社员们高唱着：“土地改革穷人翻身，合作化富根扎深；机械化土地翻身，公社化幸福来临”。
    兴农人民公社是去年8月21日，由十三个高级农业生产合作社合并建成的，全社现有十二个管理区，耕地面积十八万四千五百四十六亩，二千八百七十二户，一万三千一百三十四口人，有男女劳动力四千四百零四人，耕畜一千九百十六匹，每个男劳动力平均种地六十二亩，每头牲畜平均负担九十六亩，这个公社在国家的帮助下，已经向农业机械化跨进了一大步。现有拖拉机四十混合台（折合六十八点二标准台），机引农具九种八十七台（件），机耕面积达50％以上，从翻地、播种、锄草到秋收、脱谷、运输等主要农活，已有三分之一左右由机械作业。人民公社化加上机械化，像是两个有力的翅膀，使兴农人民公社展翅高飞，鹏程万里。
    兴农人民公社地处北纬四十八度，一年的无霜期只有一百二十五天左右。怎样在这短促的时间里把粮食拿到手？过去一直是个严重问题。这里虽然有大片肥沃的土地，可是因为地多人少，劳畜力不足，给生产带来了很大的困难，特别是在个体农民小农经济时期更为严重。解放后在党的领导下，这里和全国各地一样进行了土地改革，走
  了互助合作道路。组织起来的集体的力量，使生产有了很大的发展，特别是合作化以后，这里的生产面貌有了很大的改变，耕作逐年细致了，产量逐年提高了。但是还不能从根本上战胜大自然。为此，进一步发展合作互助的力量和用现代化生产工具对农业进行技术改造，成为这里广大农民十分迫切的要求。高级农业生产合作社的建立，开始为农业机械化提供了条件：高级社劳动力组织得更合理了，积累的资金较初级社多了，地块又大了些，这就有可能使他们开始使用机械耕作。从1956年国家的拖拉机站给这里的高级农业生产合作社代耕开始，这里就进入了用现代化生产工具对农业进行技术改造的新阶段。千百年来用弯勾犁生产的农业进入了“铁牛”时代。1956年兴业高级社（现在公社的一个管理区）头一回请拖拉机站的脱谷机打小麦，五天时间，就把全社过去需要一个多月才能打完的小麦脱谷完毕；还请拖拉机站的拖拉机深翻了六百亩地。这一年，他们的秋收工作和下一年生产的准备工作都比往年提前。社员们对机械作业的威力夸不绝口。但是由于一套生产工具两家管理，拖拉机站管理机械到底和高级社农民隔了一层，这就在生产过程中时常发生不够协调的现象。当需要机械的时候，不能马上调来，调来了，有时又用不上了，对生产有很大影响。为了解决这个矛盾，进而采取了由拖拉机站把农业机械租给高级社使用的办法，也叫做“国有社（高级社）营”的方法。这种形式解决了拖拉机站在代耕中存在的问题，耕作便利了，及时了，拖拉机利用率显著的提高了。但是，后来发展中又暴露出新的矛盾：一方面，高级社这方面总想让拖拉机多干活，有时候对拖拉机的爱护和保养注意的差些；另一方面，拖拉机的驾驶员一心只想降低消耗，节省油料，而考虑作业质量就不够，这也影响生产。于是又发展为“社（高级社）有社（高级社）营”的形式，国家把拖拉机下放，卖给高级社。这样，机械所有权与使用权统一之后，不仅前边所说的矛盾立即得到解决，促进了生产的发展，而且为依靠群众力量加速农业机械化开辟了道路。当时仅就生产方面，兴业高级社1957年比邻近条件相同的高级社，多打粮食十一万一千多斤，节省马料一万余斤，每亩单位面积产量比1956年提高22％。
    随着高级社生产力一步步的发展和农民的社会主义觉悟的提高，特别是1958年总路线的贯彻，生产的全面大发展大跃进，高级社一方面在发展生产当中，充分的发挥了它的作用；一方面开始感觉到在组织规模和活动范围等方面，显得不相适应。首先是拖拉机受到地界的限制，在机械耕作中施展不开，守林、兴业两个高级社，因机车作业地头抹弯互相压地，就多占了一百五十多亩地。耕作中垅头还显得短，地块还显得小，限制了机械效率的进一步发挥，按机车要求，垅长在一千到一千五百米较合适，但是当时机械作业的地块有的才一百米长，致使拖拉机空运转过多，少干了活计，多耗了油料，守林高级社空运转时间就占去了20％左右，这是亟需解决的。
    同样，在高级社范围内，已经开始感到大、中、小型机车不能很好配合，兴业高级社有两台拖拉机，都是二十五匹马力的小型拖拉机，用它运输或者干零活很好使，但是用它翻地就比不上大、中型机车翻的深，效率高，而且这类小型的轮胎式机车，在泥泞的土地上耕作就不大好用，造成很大不便；另一方面，在农具配套上，不能收到一具多用之效，一台机车若是配一整套农具，高级社自己用不了，花钱多，积压资金，浪费农具，配少了又不够用，有机车也不能很好发挥作用。
    还有，靠高级社积累资金也显得不够，“顾前顾不了后”，“有钱买马没钱买鞍”，购买成套的拖拉机办不到，有了拖拉机，后边拖带的一整套农具又一次买不起。
    在这个时候，各方面的飞跃发展，使高级社力量显得有些单薄，活动范围受到限制，不仅在农业机械化的更大发展中显得不相适应，就是在大兴水利，大办工业，大搞多种经营等每个方面也有不少相同的问题不能解决，比如众兴高级社的水库，要修在乾元高级社的境内才行，可是双方酝酿了几次，由于力量不足，没修起来。在大办工业，大搞多种经营和基本建设，资源利用等方面，也受到限制，在农作物合理安排上，也不容易更好贯彻因地制宜的原则。这样，在一定程度上，就妨碍了生产力的更大发展。
    还在1957年秋，兴业、远见、劝业三个高级社从协作中，从实现机械化的过程中，就感觉到社小力量单薄，要想更进一步发展生产，要想农业机械化，唯一的出路是办大社，并且有过多次并社的酝酿，但是怎样并法，组织形式是什么样的好，发展生产的方针是什么，还都不明确，正在这个时候，毛主席关于人民公社的指示，就像指路明灯一样照亮了人们的前进道路，兴农人民公社成立了。
    生产力大发展
    兴农人民公社一经建立，它的一大二公的特点，不仅立即使农村生产力得到大大发展，更为农业机械化开辟了广阔的道路。
    公社成立后，很快就调整了插花地六十五块，调换地块四千八百七十五亩，消灭了地块之间的空地格地边三千七百个。土地连成片，便于拖拉机作业，这就提高了机械效率，同是一台机车，过去在四百八十米长的地块作业，完成作业量一百一十二亩，每亩成本三角三分，现在在一千四百米长的地块作业，能完成作业量二百零三亩，每亩成本降到一角九分。由于土地连片，消灭了空地格地边，这就增加了耕地二千九百二十五亩。
    公社实行了农业机械“社有区（管理区）营”，即农业机械由公社所有，交管理区使用的办法，这就便于做到机械配套，统一调剂，充分发挥农业机械的作用。公社根据机械的性能和作业的需要，给各管理区搭配了大、中、小型机车，使它们能互相配合作业，几种工序同时进行：大型链轨车在前边翻地，小型轮胎车就可以紧跟着耙、捞；大型链轨车在前边播种，小型轮胎车随后就镇压平整土地，比光用小型轮胎车的效率提高一倍，而且质量更好。今年麦秋脱谷，公社统一调剂了四台脱谷机，分片轮流脱谷，充分发挥了脱谷机的作用，全公社四万零五百亩小麦，基本上全用脱谷机脱完了，每台脱谷机比高级社时，提高效率一倍多。
    公社生产的全面大发展，收入大大增加，而且又能统一筹划资金，集中使用，这就使公社有力量买得起更多的农业机械，就收到很大效果。在这一年中，为农业机械化积累的资金三十二万四千元（不包括今年秋收分配的积累部分），不到一年就增加了拖拉机二十多台和大批拖带农具。有些大型贵重农具，如联合收割机，也能买得起了。守林管理区在公社化前，原有三台拖拉机，公社化后，又分配给他们两台拖拉机和九种十二件拖带农具，这些农业机械，如果是在高级社时购买，价值约占这个高级社全年总收入的50％。如今社员说：“没觉着花钱，拖拉机就开来了。”
    公社建立后，他们有了拖拉机修配厂，并根据机械化大发展的情况，组织了四名流动工人，分工到各管理区去，以免机械因小毛病就进修配厂影响作业。公社还统一调配了技术人员，使新老拖拉机手互相配合。还扩大了原有的业余拖拉机学校，培养出本社的技术人员一百七十一名。
    公社化加机械化带来的一个最突出的变化是农村生产力的飞跃发展。以这个公社的拖拉机手张志贤为例，他驾驶的四十五马力的拖拉机，在拖带农具不够充足的情况下，一个人今年干的主要农活，如果换成旧式农具，同是一个人，得赶着四匹马，干上十一年。今年春天种小麦的时候，张志贤开着拖拉机，牵引着播种机，和两个农具手一起，一天播种了二百二十多亩，如果换成马拉农具，一副犁，六匹马，四个人，一天只种二十亩，要十一天种完。张志贤自豪的说：“如今我少抽袋烟的工夫，就够弯勾犁干一天的了”。公社把用机械干活腾出来的人力畜力，加以统一安排，合理组织，这就出现了农业用工逐渐减少，而耕作反而能够越来越细致的巨大变化。公社把机械作业腾出的大部分劳动力投入农田加工，增加措施，这样，就使这个地多人少的地方，也能够很好的贯彻“八字宪法”，这就在农业生产战线上赢得了时机，夺取了主动，做到了“四及时”（翻地、播种、夏
  锄、收获及时）。去年秋天，公社刚成立，机（械）、马、牛结合，深翻地就达总面积的73％以上，从此改变了过去没有力量进行深翻的局面。同时还兴修水利工程五十八万土方。今年春天播种，七天半的时间就把四万零五百亩小麦种完，这是从来没有过的速度。今年半个月工夫种完大田，比往年提前二十天左右，完全适时，并且贯彻了合理密植，种的更细致，质量更好。还在紧张的春耕同时，公社组织
  了一千五百多劳动力，二百台大车，八百匹马，大搞积肥送粪，今年的施肥面积占75％，每亩施肥量达到四千二百斤，比大跃进的1958年增加了36.8％。今年夏锄比过去真是遍遍如绣花，而且速度也快，仅在四十天内就结束了四铲四趟，没荒一亩地。在这里，今年的老天风不调雨不顺，从去年9月到今年5月八个月没下过透雨，秋天又连雨受涝，但是由于春天在小苗出土的时候，公社组织了两次全民性的查田补苗抗旱斗争，由于土地用农业机械深翻之后抗旱抗涝力强，庄稼仍然大大胜过往年。在一年最紧张的“抢秋”时候，小麦刚刚登上场院，拖拉机就带着机引犁，把麦田的土地深翻过来，为明年的继续跃进作好准备；在场院里，拖拉机带着脱谷机，轰隆轰隆日夜不停的打小麦；公路上烟尘四起，拖拉机带着拖车，运送小麦入仓。就在这样繁忙的季节里，因为有了农业机械，还在大秋作物收割之前，社员们就腾出手来，起土豆、割糜子、拔饭豆、晒干菜，做完零星活计，并做好收割大田的准备工作。由于使用农业机械耕作，提前完成播种，又增加了种种措施，这就促使了作物早熟，避免了早霜威胁。
    粮食产量大增加
    这个公社的生产力飞跃发展的直接效果是：农业生产连续两年的惊人跃进，正如社员们所说：“公社化加机械化，人、机（械）、马、牛力量大，八字宪法开了花，粮食产量大增加。”在公社化后的头一年，1959年，农业总产值比1958年提高了40.6％，每个农业劳动力生产粮食一万七千六百三十二斤，每个劳动日平均生产粮食九十三斤。在公社化加上机械化之后，特别是粮食商品率的提高更其显著，1959年粮食商品率达到总产量的67.3％，每个农业人口交给国家的商品粮达二千八百七十五斤，比1958年提高51.24％，比1957年提高了130％。这里把兴农人民公社三年粮食产量和商品率的提高作个对比：
    多种经营大跃进
    机械化生产节省出来的大批人力畜力，加上人民公社兴办了各种公共福利事业，从家庭里解放出大批妇女劳动力，这批妇女配合着农业机械干活，劳动效率大大提高，这就使他们能从农业战线上腾出一千来名强壮的劳动力，四十七台马车，三百一十二匹马，从无到有的办起了公社工业，大搞多种经营，大搞基本建设和短途运输，扩大了经营范围，促进了公社经济的全面发展全面跃进。公社经营了原拖拉机站的拖拉机修配厂，建立了小型铁木厂、发电厂、机械修配所和土化肥厂等十九处，举办了制米、炼乳、制粉、酿酒、编织、被服等小型工厂一百二十处，已经基本上形成了公社、管理区、生产队办工业的网点，今年总产值可达四十九万五千多元。他们并且为适应畜牧业大发展的需要，兴修了“万鸡场”、“畜牧场”等。在这里，老黄牛一向是农业生产上仅次于马的重要畜力，但是随着农业机械的增多，它已退居于辅助地位，公社抽出六十来头黄牛，“转业”专门生产牛奶，供应市场需要。全公社养猪现已达到九千七百头，年终可达一人一头，今年已出售四千头，年终还可出售一千头（今年全社平均两口多人卖一头猪给国家）。他们今年的工农业和牧副业等各种生产的总产值可达六百九十六万五千多元，比大跃进的1958年提高68％。
    随着生产的全面大发展大跃进，一方面，社员们强烈要求增加公共积累，买拖拉机、电动机等许多东西，进一步实现农业机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化，他们今年要拿出一百六十三万二千多元作为公共积累，占总收入的23％。目前我国自产的“东方红”拖拉机和电动机，正在陆续运到这里，另一方面，社员收入也比过去大为提高，生产进一步得到改善，他们今年每个社员在集体分配中，平均得一百元，比1958年提高40.5％，比1957年提高14.2％。加上社员个人家庭副业收入，今年每个社员平均收入达一百三十四元六角。社员们欢喜地说：“我们公社现在家大业大，日子越过越兴旺，真是踩着梯子上楼——步步高。”（附图表）（按：粮食自给部分包括农业人口和非农业人口的口粮、种籽和各种牲畜饲料。）
