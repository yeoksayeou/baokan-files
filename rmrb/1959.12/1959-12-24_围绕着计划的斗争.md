　　The struggle between the two roads in scientific research is a long-term and complex one. An important aspect of this struggle is the question of whether or not to obey the state plan. Socialist scientific research serves the development of socialist economic and cultural undertakings. It must rely on the strength of the collective to carry out planned and purposeful work, and cannot be left to drift. Capitalist scientific research, on the other hand, serves the interests of a few capitalists. It can only be carried out by the strength of a few people and cannot have a unified plan. It can be seen that whether or not to have a plan is one of the fundamental differences between socialist and capitalist scientific research.

　　Today, whether or not scientific research needs a plan is also a question of whether or not to have the leadership of the Party. Formulating a research plan is an important aspect of the Party's leadership. Through the plan, the Party's policies are implemented, the direction, goals, and steps of research work are clarified, all positive factors are mobilized, and scientific research is powerfully used to serve socialist construction. People with bourgeois ideas regard scientific research as a tool for hunting personal fame and profit. They do not accept the leadership of the Party, and they always try their best not to obey the state plan. Therefore, sharp struggles often occur around the plan. One of their arguments is: "The plan restricts the enthusiasm of the masses," and "Scientific research is an exploration of the unknown, and it is fundamentally impossible to formulate a plan." Is this really the case?

　　Saying that scientific research is an exploration of the unknown seems to make some sense on the surface. But it is far from complete. Because scientific research always has its purpose. The purpose of our scientific research is to better understand and master the laws of nature, and then use them in the current socialist and future communist construction. With a purpose, what to explore is by no means entirely "unknown." Moreover, nature is not a chaotic and unknowable thing. It has its own regularity. Therefore, the exploration of the mysteries of nature is not without rules to follow, and can only be done blindly. Of course, the main point of the problem is not here, but whether scientific research can be carried out according to plan. Our comprehensive planning for scientific research has not been long, and we do not have much experience. Practice has proved that planning is not only entirely possible but also very necessary. In 1956, the Central Government formulated the National Twelve-Year Plan for the Development of Science and Technology, and then all regions and departments began to formulate their own long-term plans and annual plans for the development of science and technology. This promoted the development of science throughout the country and set off a rising upsurge of marching towards science and technology. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward last year, scientific planning has exerted tremendous power, enabling us to achieve unprecedented leaps and harvests in scientific research. Facts have also proved that only by formulating comprehensive scientific plans can we ensure that the scientific and technological problems that need to be solved urgently in the country's economic construction and national defense construction can be solved effectively and in a timely manner, and that we can strengthen weak links and fill gaps in a timely manner, establish a relatively complete scientific and technological system, and that we can distinguish between priorities and concentrate our efforts, so that scientific research work can be carried out more, faster, better, and more economically under the existing conditions.

　　The enthusiasm of the masses is of course very valuable. Without the enthusiasm of the masses, nothing can be done, and it will certainly not be done well. Therefore, the Party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly told us to cherish and care for the enthusiasm of the masses, and to try every means to mobilize and give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses. However, what we are referring to is not some abstract and general enthusiasm, but the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, the socialist enthusiasm of the masses. If someone insists on calling the bourgeois personal pursuit and diligent pursuit of profit also enthusiasm, then there is nothing in common with what we are talking about. In scientific research, what is the enthusiasm of the masses? That is: the broad masses of people urgently demand to get rid of the backward state of science and technology, and the ambition to quickly climb the peak of science and technology. This kind of enthusiasm does not come from personal self-interest, but to build our country into a socialist power more quickly. The scientific research plans formulated according to the needs of the country's socialist construction are precisely the embodiment of this enthusiasm of the masses, and also a powerful guarantee for giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, how can it be said that the plan "restricts" the enthusiasm of the masses? Of course, for those who have serious bourgeois individualism, the plan is indeed a kind of "restriction" on them. Because they can no longer engage in research regardless of the needs of the country and the whole, only starting from personal fame and profit, and they can no longer do whatever they want. If this is considered a "restriction," then what is wrong with it?

　　They also complained that the plan "erases personal interests and expertise." If it refers to the interest in building socialism, the interest in using scientific research to serve socialist construction, the expertise that helps to build socialism, and the expertise that helps to rapidly develop our country's science and technology, isn't it very good? Why should we "erase" them? In fact, no matter where or in what unit, when formulating scientific research plans, they have not only never "erased" such interests and expertise, but on the contrary, they have always attached importance to and encouraged them. Then, what are they complaining about? Indeed, we are opposed to those bourgeois interests in pursuing personal fame and profit, and we are opposed to those who use personal interests and personal expertise as an excuse not to obey the needs of the country and not to be willing to serve socialist construction. If we have to call it "erasing," then what is wrong with this kind of "erasing"? Bourgeois individualism must be resolutely opposed. However, this does not mean that when conducting comprehensive planning for scientific research, when formulating plans, we will completely not consider the interests and expertise of each individual. On the contrary, under the major premise of obeying the needs of the country and being beneficial to socialist construction, personal expertise and interests will be given sufficient attention and appropriate arrangements, so as to give full play to them and add more contribution to the socialist scientific cause.

　　The various absurd arguments against scientific research must obey the state plan are obviously untenable. But what exactly is their intention? As mentioned earlier, it is nothing more than an attempt to use the "special" nature of scientific research as an excuse, and the "reason" that the Party does not understand scientific research, to oppose the Party's leadership over scientific research, and to oppose the fact that scientific research must take the socialist road. We must thoroughly criticize this kind of erroneous statement, so that the scientific cause can develop faster under the leadership of the Party and under the unified arrangement of the state plan.

### 围绕着计划的斗争

　　围绕着计划的斗争
　　雷霆
    科学研究工作中两条道路的斗争是长期的、复杂的。这个斗争的一个重要的方面，就是要不要服从国家计划的问题。社会主义的科学研究是为发展社会主义经济和文化事业服务的，它必须依靠集体的力量有计划有目的的进行，不能放任自流。而资本主义的科学研究是为少数资本家谋利服务的，它仅能依靠少数人的力量进行，无法有统一的计划。可见，要计划还是不要计划，是社会主义科学研究和资本主义科学研究的根本区别之一。
    在今天，科学研究要不要计划，同时也就是要不要党的领导的问题。制订研究计划，是党的领导的一个重要方面，通过计划，贯彻了党的方针政策，明确了研究工作的方向、目标、步骤，调动一切积极因素，使科学研究有力地为社会主义建设服务。具有资产阶级思想的人，把科学研究当成猎取个人名利的工具，不接受党的领导，他们总是千方百计的不服从国家计划，因此，围绕着计划，经常会发生尖锐的斗争。他们的论据之一是：“计划束缚了群众的积极性”，“科学研究是对未知的探索，是根本不可能制订计划的”。事情果真如此吗？
    说科学研究是对未知的探索，表面上看，似乎有些道理。但也是远不完全的。因为科学研究总有它的目的。我们开展科学研究的目的就是为了要更好地认识与掌握自然界的规律，然后用之于当前的社会主义和将来的共产主义建设。有了目的，探索什么就决不是全然“未知”的了。而且，自然界也不是一团杂乱无章的不可知之物。它有它自己的规律性。因此，对于自然界的奥秘的探索，也并不是无所遵循，只能瞎摸一气的。当然，问题的主要点还不在这里，而在于科学研究能不能按计划进行。我们对科学研究的全面规划，为时不久，经验不多。实践证明计划不仅是完全可能而且是十分必要的。1956年，中央制订了国家十二年科学技术的发展规划，接着各地、各部门也都开始制订了本地区、本部门发展科学技术的长远规划和年度计划。这就在全国范围内推动了科学事业的发展，掀起一个日益高涨的向科学技术进军的热潮。特别是去年大跃进以来，科学规划更发挥了巨大的威力，使我们在科学研究上获得了空前未有的跃进和丰收。事实也同样证明，只有制订全面的科学规划，才能保证国家经济建设与国防建设中所迫切需要解决的科学技术问题，得到切实地、及时地解决，才能及时的加强薄弱环节和填补空白，建立一个比较完整的科学技术体系，才能分别轻重缓急，集中使用力量，使科学研究工作能够在现有条件下多快好省地进行。
    群众的积极性当然是非常可贵的。如果没有群众的积极性，什么事情也办不起来，并且一定办不好的。因此，党和毛主席曾再三告诉我们要珍视、爱护群众的积极性，要千方百计地调动和发挥群众的积极性。然而，我们所指的，并不是什么抽象的、笼笼统统的积极性，而是群众的革命积极性，群众的社会主义积极性。如果有人硬要把资产阶级的个人钻营、孜孜牟利，也称做积极性的话，那和我们所说的毫无共同之处。在科学研究方面，什么是群众的积极性呢？那就是：广大群众迫切要求摆脱科学技术上的落后状态的愿望和迅速攀登科学技术高峰的雄心壮志。这种积极性并不出于个人的私利，而是为了更快地把我国建设成为社会主义的强国。根据国家社会主义建设需要所制订的科学研究的规划、计划，就正是群众的这种积极性的体现，同时也是最充分地发挥群众积极性的有力保证。因此，这又怎么能说：计划“束缚”了群众的积极性呢？当然，对于那些有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想的人来说，计划确实是对他们的一种“束缚”。因为他们再也不能像过去那样不顾国家、整体的需要，只从个人名利出发去搞研究了，再也不能想搞什么就搞什么了。如果说，这也算是“束缚”的话，那又有什么不对呢？
    他们还埋怨计划“抹杀了个人的兴趣与专长”。如果指的是建设社会主义的兴趣，用科学研究来为社会主义建设服务的兴趣，有助于建设社会主义的专长以及有助于迅速发展我国科学技术的专长，不正是好得很吗？又为什么要去“抹杀”它们呢？事实上，不论什么地方和什么单位，在制订科学研究计划的时候，不仅从来也没有“抹杀”过这样的兴趣和专长，相反却是一贯地加以重视和鼓励的。那末，他们究竟在埋怨些什么呢？的确，我们是反对那些资产阶级的追求个人名利的兴趣，反对那些以个人兴趣、个人专长作为不服从国家需要和不愿意为社会主义建设服务的借口的。如果硬要把它称作“抹杀”的话，这种“抹杀”，又有何妨呢？资产阶级个人主义是必须坚决反对的。然而，这决不是说：在进行科学研究全面规划的时候，在制订计划的时候，就完全不去考虑各个人的志趣和专长了。恰恰相反，在服从国家需要和有利于社会主义建设的大前提下，个人的专长和志趣都会得到足够的重视和适当的安排，以利其充分发挥和为社会主义的科学事业多添一分贡献的。
    反对科学研究必须服从国家计划的种种荒谬论调，显然是站不住脚的。但他们的用意究竟何在呢？如前所述，无非是企图以科学研究“特殊”为借口，以党不懂科学研究为“理由”，来反对党对科学研究的领导，反对科学研究必须走社会主义道路。对于这种错误言论，我们必须要彻底的批判，使科学事业在党的领导下，在国家计划的统一安排下，更快地向前发展。
