The fisheries production in North Vietnam has been rapidly restored and developed under the leadership of the Labour Party and the Vietnamese government since the restoration of peace. Despite the impact of the climate, the production of saltwater fisheries has continued to increase. The output in 1955 was 89,000 tons, and it is expected to increase to 130,000 tons in 1959.

    The number of fishing boats and nets has increased year by year. There were 9,636 fishing boats in 1955, which increased to 12,291 in 1959; there were 48,396 fishing nets in 1955, and 71,173 in 1959. At present, fisheries production in North Vietnam is also moving towards collectivization. There are now 240 fishery cooperatives in the entire north. Freshwater fish farming has also been similarly developed. From the plains to the mountains, thousands of agricultural cooperatives, state-owned farms, military reclamation farms, and schools have implemented their own fish farming. According to preliminary statistics, the total fish pond area in the entire north is currently 2,500 hectares, with an average yield of 1,350 to 2,500 kilograms per hectare, and some individual places reaching 4,100 kilograms.

    越南北方渔业欣欣向荣
    自和平恢复以来，越南北方在劳动党和越南政府的领导下，渔业生产得到迅速的恢复和发展。尽管受到气候的影响，咸水渔业的生产仍然不断增加，1955年的产量为八万九千吨，1959年预计可能增加到十三万吨。
    渔船和渔网与年俱增。1955年有九千六百三十六只渔船，1959年增加到一万二千二百九十一只；1955年有渔网四万八千三百九十六个，1959年有七万一千一百七十三个。目前，越南北方渔业生产也正在走向合作化。现在全北方已有二百四十个渔业合作社。淡水养鱼工作也得到同样的发展。从平原到山区，成千的农业社、国营农场、军垦农场和学校已经实行自己养鱼。据初步统计，目前，全北方鱼池面积共有二千五百公顷，平均每公顷产量达到一千三百五十到二千五百公斤，个别地方达到四千一百公斤。
