Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 2nd: According to local newspapers today, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a telegram to the Japanese House of Councillors on November 30th, requesting the Japanese House of Councillors to adopt a wise attitude and force the Japanese government to revoke the agreement on war reparations to the South Vietnamese authorities alone, which was illegally passed by the Japanese House of Representatives.

The telegram said that the Vietnamese people are extremely indignant about the passage of the agreement on war reparations to the South Vietnamese authorities alone by the Japanese House of Representatives under the pressure of the Nobusuke Kishi government. The telegram pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government used deceitful and illegal means to force the House of Representatives to make decisions that do not reflect the true wishes of the Japanese people.

The telegram said, "We declare once again that the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are not qualified to represent the entire Vietnamese people in accepting war reparations granted to Vietnam, and believe that all agreements signed between the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities and the Japanese government on this issue are completely invalid in law."

The telegram concluded by saying that the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hopes that the Japanese House of Councillors will revoke this illegal agreement for the sake of fairness, justice, the friendship between the two peoples, and the interests of peace.

On the same day, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee also sent telegrams to the Japanese Committee Against Compensation to South Vietnam and other organizations, fully supporting the struggle of the Japanese people, political parties, organizations, and parliamentarians against the agreement on war reparations to the South Vietnamese authorities. The telegram pointed out that the agreement passed by the Japanese House of Representatives under the pressure of the Nobusuke Kishi government is illegal and invalid.

Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, said in response to a question from a reporter from the Japanese "Akahata" on November 26 regarding the Nobusuke Kishi government's signing of a war reparations agreement with the South Vietnamese authorities alone that, according to the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities only have the task of temporary administrative management in South Vietnam. The Nobusuke Kishi government's signing of a war reparations agreement with the South Vietnamese authorities is a violation of the 1954 Geneva Accords and international law. This act not only does not conform to the actual situation in Vietnam, but is also an act of following the US imperialist plan to expand armaments and prepare for war in South Vietnam.

    越南国会致电日本参议院指出
    南越同日本签订赔偿协定无效
    要求迫使撤销日本众议院通过的这项非法协定
    新华社河内2日电　据此间报纸今天报道，越南民主共和国国会常务委员会委员长孙德胜11月30日打电报给日本参议院，要求日本参议院采取明智的态度，迫使日本政府撤销在日本众议院非法通过的单独给南越当局战争赔偿的协定。
    电文说，越南人民对日本众议院在岸信介政府的压力下通过单独给南越当局战争赔偿的协定这件事感到极端愤慨。电文指出，岸信介政府利用欺骗和非法手段，强使众议院作出的决定不能反映日本人民的真正愿望。
    电文说，我们再一次宣布，吴庭艳当局没有资格代表越南全国人民接受给予越南的战争赔偿，并认为吴庭艳当局和日本政府之间就这一问题所签订的一切协定在法理上完全无效。
    电文最后说，越南民主共和国国会希望日本参议院为了公平、正义和两国人民的友谊、和平的利益，撤销这一非法的协定。
    同一天，越南保卫世界和平委员会和越南亚非人民团结委员会也打电报给日本反对给南越赔偿委员会等团体，全力支持日本人民、政党、团体、议员为反对给南越当局战争赔偿的协定而进行的斗争。电文指出，日本众议院在岸信介政府的压力下，通过的这个协定是非法和无效的。
    越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席阮春水，11月26日就岸信介政府单独同南越当局签订战争赔偿协定答日本“赤旗报”记者问时说，根据1954年关于越南的日内瓦协议，吴庭艳当局只负有在南越作临时行政管理的任务。岸信介政府同南越当局签订战争赔偿协定是违反1954年日内瓦协议国际法的行为，这一行为不仅不符合于越南的实际情况，而且也是追随美帝国主义在南越扩军备战计划的行为。
