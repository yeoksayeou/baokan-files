Grass-rope Conveyor is Economical and Practical
	Each Unit Costs Ten Yuan, Efficiency Improves Hundredfold Compared to Manual Labor
	In Hanyang County, Hubei Province, various water conservancy construction sites are promoting a simple, economical, and practical high-efficiency soil transportation tool: the grass-rope conveyor.
	To manufacture this conveyor, one only needs to use hemp rope as the warp and rice straw rope as the weft, weaving a several-zhang-long conveyor belt into a loop, and then fitting both ends onto fixed rotating wheels. It can be driven by the power of a water pump, or by manpower, animal power, or a windmill. It is suitable for transporting soil from low-lying areas to high slopes, or sending soil from high slopes to low-lying areas. According to experiments, using this conveyor to transport soil from a low-lying area more than two zhang deep to a high slope, one can transport 450 cubic meters per day, improving efficiency more than a hundredfold compared to manual labor.
	The cost of manufacturing one of these conveyors is only about ten yuan, and the structure is simple, so it has quickly been promoted on construction sites.

    草履带运土机经济好用
    每部造价十元  工效比人挑提高百倍
    湖北汉阳县各个水利工地正在推广一种构造简单、经济好用的高工效运土工具——草履带运土机。
    制造这种运土机，只需用麻绳作经，稻草绳作纬，编成几丈长的履带，结成环形，再把两头套在固定的转动轮上就成了。它既可用抽水机的动力带动，也可用人力、畜力、风车带动，适宜于由洼地运土到高坡或高坡送土到洼地。根据实验，用这种运土机从两丈多深的洼地运土到高坡，一天能运四百五十立方米，比人挑土提高工效一百倍以上。
    这种运土机，制造一部只需十元左右，构造简单，因此很快就在工地上推广开了。
