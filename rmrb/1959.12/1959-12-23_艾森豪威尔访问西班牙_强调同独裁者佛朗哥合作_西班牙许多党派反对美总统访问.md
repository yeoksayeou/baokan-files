Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, 22nd: US President Eisenhower, after attending the Western Four-Power Summit in Paris, visited Madrid yesterday and left Madrid by plane this morning for Morocco.

Spanish dictator Franco welcomed Eisenhower with the grandest of ceremonies, forcing many shivering Madrid residents to stand in the streets and watch Eisenhower ride with him in an open car. The Associated Press reported from Madrid yesterday that Franco regarded Eisenhower's visit as "praise" for his anti-communist actions. The news agency also wrote: "Today, some of the best forward bomber bases of the United States are located in Spain. ... Eisenhower landed at one of these bases near Madrid."

In his speech upon arriving in Madrid, Eisenhower emphasized "cooperation" with Franco's Spain and expressed his hope that through his visit, the "bonds of understanding and lofty purpose" between Franco's Spain and the United States would be strengthened. Franco said in his reply that the air bases established by the United States in Spain are "symbols of our friendship."

During his stay in Spain, Eisenhower held talks with Franco. In a joint communiqué issued by both sides, it was stated that "satisfactory progress" had been made in fulfilling the "Economic and Defense Agreement" signed by the two countries in 1953. Under this agreement, the United States established naval and air force military bases in Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Cartagena and other places in Spain and stationed troops at these bases. The agreement also stipulates that the United States provide economic and military assistance to Spain.

The French "La Croix" recently revealed that the issues discussed between Eisenhower and Franco may have included the placement of atomic weapons in Spain and the arming of the Spanish army with nuclear missiles.

On the eve of Eisenhower's arrival in Madrid, six Spanish political parties and groups opposed to Franco's fascist dictatorship jointly wrote to the US Embassy in Madrid, opposing Eisenhower's visit. The letter pointed out that this visit demonstrated the US government's "friendliness and solidarity" with the Franco regime.

The Catalan Christian Democratic Party, in an open letter to Eisenhower distributed yesterday, said, "Your visit is just a visit to Franco, Franco who is the last living friend and accomplice of Hitler and Mussolini, and the persecutor of democratic citizens." Students in Madrid also distributed leaflets on the 20th opposing Eisenhower's visit and the establishment of US military bases in Spain.

Yves Moreau, a commentator for the French "L'Humanité," wrote today about Eisenhower's trip to Spain: Eisenhower, who claims to be on a peace mission abroad, talked highly of "peace in justice and freedom," but he shook hands with Franco. But for the tens of thousands of Spanish anti-fascists who are still in exile, the moment of peace has not yet arrived. (Attached picture)

　　艾森豪威尔访问西班牙
    强调同独裁者佛朗哥合作
    西班牙许多党派反对美总统访问
    据新华社22日讯　马德里消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在巴黎开完西方四国政府首脑会议以后，昨天到马德里访问，他已经在今天早晨乘飞机离开马德里前往摩洛哥。
    西班牙独裁者佛朗哥用最盛大的仪式来欢迎艾森豪威尔，他让许多冷得发抖的马德里居民站在街头看着艾森豪威尔和他一同乘敞篷汽车驶过。美联社昨天从马德里发出的消息说，佛朗哥认为艾森豪威尔的访问是对他的反共行动的“赞扬”。这家通讯社还写道：“今天，美国最好的前沿轰炸机基地有一些就设在西班牙。……艾森豪威尔就是在马德里附近的其中之一的基地降落的”。
    艾森豪威尔在到达马德里的演说中强调同佛朗哥西班牙的“合作”，并且表示希望通过他这次访问，增强佛朗哥西班牙同美国之间的“谅解和崇高目的的纽带”。佛朗哥在答辞中说，美国在西班牙建立的空军基地是“我们友谊的象征”。
    艾森豪威尔在西班牙停留期间曾经同佛朗哥举行了会谈。在双方发表的联合公报中表示，在履行1953年签订的两国“经济和防御协定”方面已经取得了“令人满意的进展”。美国就是根据这项协定在西班牙的马德里、巴塞罗那、塞维尔和喀他亨那等地建立了海、空军军事基地并且在这些基地驻扎部队的。这项协定还规定美国向西班牙提供经济和军事援助。
    法国“十字架报”不久前透露，艾森豪威尔这次和佛朗哥会谈的问题还可能包括在西班牙放置原子武器和用核导弹武装西班牙军队的问题。
    在艾森豪威尔抵达马德里前夕，反对佛朗哥法西斯独裁的西班牙六个政党和团体联合写信给美国驻马德里大使馆，反对艾森豪威尔的这次访问。信中指出，这次访问表明了美国政府对佛朗哥政权的“友好和声援”。
    加泰罗尼亚的天主教民主党在昨天散发的给艾森豪威尔的一封公开信中说，“你的访问只是对佛朗哥进行的一次访问，佛朗哥是希特勒和墨索里尼的还活着的最后一个朋友和共谋者，他是民主公民的迫害者”。马德里的学生在20日也散发了反对艾森豪威尔访问和美国在西班牙建立军事基地的传单。
    法国“人道报”评论员伊夫·摩罗今天就艾森豪威尔西班牙之行写道：自称他这次出国负有和平使命的艾森豪威尔虽然高谈“在正义和自由中的和平”，但是他却同佛朗哥握了手。可是对于数以万计的始终在流亡中的西班牙反法西斯者来说，和平的时刻尚未到来。（附图片）
    从一九五三年以来，美国支出了三亿五千万美元在西班牙修建空军基地、海军设备和油管。驻在西班牙的美国空军就有七千人。左图是美国在西班牙的主要军事基地图。
