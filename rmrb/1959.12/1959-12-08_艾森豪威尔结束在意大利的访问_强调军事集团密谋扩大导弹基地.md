Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 7th: U.S. President Eisenhower has concluded his visit to Italy and departed from Rome by plane yesterday for Ankara, the capital of Turkey.

During his visit to Rome, Eisenhower held talks with Italian President Gronchi, Prime Minister Segni, and Foreign Minister Pella. In a joint communiqué issued by Eisenhower and Gronchi on the 5th, they stated that they discussed a "wide range of international issues of interest to both countries." The communiqué emphasized that both sides believe "the North Atlantic Alliance remains the cornerstone of their foreign policy." The communiqué stated that Eisenhower and Gronchi also discussed their respective plans to visit the Soviet Union next year.

The communiqué also mentioned the issue of "helping" underdeveloped regions, emphasizing that "free nations" should "coordinate" on this issue.

According to United Press International, the issues discussed by Eisenhower with the Italian government leaders also included the question of the United States setting up new missile bases in Italy. Italy has already provided the United States with long-range missile bases and allows U.S. short-range missile forces to be stationed on Italian territory.

U.S. Undersecretary of State Murphy, who accompanied Eisenhower on his visit, told reporters on the evening of the 5th that Eisenhower expressed "sympathy" during the talks for Italy's desire to participate in the summit if disarmament and European security issues are included on the agenda of the highest-level conference. However, Eisenhower also stated that this issue must be discussed at the Western summit to be held in Paris in mid-December. Sources say that Italy is dissatisfied with the Western heads of state discussing issues related to the East-West summit while excluding Italy, emphasizing that Italy should "play a role" in resolving major European issues.

    艾森豪威尔结束在意大利的访问
    强调军事集团密谋扩大导弹基地
    新华社7日讯　罗马消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔已经结束了在意大利的访问，昨天乘飞机离开罗马前往土耳其首都安卡拉。
    艾森豪威尔在罗马访问期间同意大利总统格隆基、总理塞尼和外交部长贝拉等人举行了会谈。艾森豪威尔和格隆基在5日发表的一项会谈公报中说，他们讨论了“两国都感兴趣的广泛的国际问题”。公报强调，双方认为“北大西洋联盟仍然是他们外交政策的基石”。公报中说，艾森豪威尔和格隆基还讨论了明年他们各自访问苏联的计划。
    公报中还提到“帮助”不发达地区的问题，强调“自由国家”应该在这一问题上“取得协调”。
    据合众国际社报道，艾森豪威尔同意大利政府首脑会谈的问题中还包括美国在意大利设置新的导弹基地的问题。意大利已经向美国提供了远程导弹基地，并且允许美国的短程导弹部队驻扎在意大利的领土上。
    跟随艾森豪威尔进行访问的美国副国务卿墨菲5日晚对记者说，艾森豪威尔在会谈中对意大利这样的愿望表示“同情”：如果裁军和欧洲安全问题列入最高级会议议程，意大利希望参加会议。但是，艾森豪威尔又表示，这个问题必须在本月中旬在巴黎举行的西方最高级会议上讨论。有消息说，意大利对西方首脑会议讨论有关东西方最高级会议问题而把意大利排斥在外这一做法表示不满，它强调意大利在欧洲重大问题的解决中应当“起作用”。
