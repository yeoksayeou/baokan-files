Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: Washington dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower issued a statement on December 2nd regarding the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," backing up Nobusuke Kishi, who is facing increasingly strong opposition from the Japanese public, and urging him to sign a military alliance treaty with the United States that is hostile to China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asia in the near future.

Before issuing this statement at the White House, Eisenhower announced at a press conference that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi had accepted an invitation to visit the United States and planned to come to the United States in January next year to sign a new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

In the statement, Eisenhower said, "If he (Kishi Nobusuke) decides to come, I will welcome the opportunity to meet with him again."

Eisenhower stated in the statement that the United States "attaches great importance" to this aggressive military treaty to be signed with Japan. He also said that now "the timing is particularly opportune to conclude this new treaty with Japan, because I believe that in the current period of international affairs, it is essential that the free world maintain its unity and strength." In this way, he exposed the true face of the United States, which has been hiding under a mask of peace in recent times.

The U.S. President also tried his best to conceal the harm of this new treaty to the national interests of Japan and the peace and security of Asia, saying that the negotiations with Japan on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" are "for the common interests and the obvious interests of both countries."

    艾森豪威尔撕破和平假面具
    催促岸政府签订军事同盟条约
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔2日就修改日美“安全条约”问题发表声明，为遭到日本公众日益强烈的反对的岸信介撑腰，催促他在最近同美国签订与中国、苏联和亚洲人民为敌的军事同盟条约。
    在白宫发表这项声明以前，艾森豪威尔就在记者招待会上宣布，日本首相岸信介已经接受了访问美国的邀请，打算明年1月到美国签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中说，“如果他（岸信介）决定前来的话，我将欢迎有这个机会同他再一次会谈”。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中表示，美国“非常重视”将同日本签订的这个侵略性军事条约。他还说，现在“同日本订立这个新条约的时机是特别合乎时宜的，因为我认为在国际事务目前的这个时期，自由世界保持自身的团结和力量是至为必要的。”这样，他就暴露了美国在最近一个时期中藏在和平假面具下的真面目。
    美国总统还竭力掩饰这个新条约对日本民族利益和亚洲和平与安全的危害性，说什么同日本进行的关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判是“为了共同的利益以及两国本身明显的利益”。
