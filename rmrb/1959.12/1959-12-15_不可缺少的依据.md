Indispensable Basis
Wang Pu

When formulating plans, we must fully consider the objective possibilities of material and technical conditions, and also fully consider the subjective initiative of the people's revolutionary enthusiasm, combining the two. Plans formulated in this way are both advanced and reliable. However, not everyone understands this, and some even believe that it is somewhat risky to include people's subjective initiative as one of the bases for making plans. Their argument is: subjective initiative cannot be included in the plan. Is this the case?

The example of the Beijing Civil Lighting Fixture Factory shows that this is absolutely not the case. Every month, this factory considers the great potential of the workers' subjective initiative in technical revolution, and puts forward a leap forward plan exceeding the national plan by 20% to 30% according to needs and possibilities. The percentage of some workshops is even greater. For example, in October, the Third Workshop, according to the existing manpower, technical conditions and general rules, that is, according to the existing material and technical conditions, some people think that it is still difficult to produce 5,000 lamp nets. However, after fully considering the subjective initiative of the workers and the potential of technological innovation, they made a leap forward plan to produce 45,000 lamp nets. What was the result? The result was that not only was the output target completed, but also the reject rate and cost were lower than in September. There was no risk at all.

Examples like the Beijing Civil Lighting Fixture Factory are common in last year's Great Leap Forward and this year's continued Leap Forward. However, why do some comrades always feel that "subjective initiative cannot be included in the plan"?

Fundamentally, I am afraid that the mass viewpoint has not taken root in their minds. The subjective initiative of people that we talk about is not of any one person, or any part of the people, but of the masses of the people. In industrial and mining enterprises, it is the workers. The subjective initiative of the people is not illusory. Reforming tools, reforming equipment, reforming production methods, reforming product design, reforming labor organization, improving technical proficiency, and improving the understanding of the laws of development of objective things, etc., are all concrete manifestations of people's subjective initiative, and can all be calculated. Including people's subjective initiative in the plan means including in the plan the technological innovations and technological revolutions that people may achieve in production, and the new technologies, new experiences, and new methods that they may master. And these are not conceived out of thin air, but are proposed after people have made a scientific analysis of the development of objective things, starting from existing objective conditions, and estimating what can be done through effort and what cannot be done temporarily. This is completely verifiable and traceable. Those who do not consider people's subjective initiative when making plans, and feel that it is unreliable to use people's subjective initiative as a basis for the plan, are essentially distrustful of the masses. They do not regard people as the most active factor in the productive forces. They only believe in the role of objective material and technical conditions, and do not believe in the positive counter-effect of people's subjective initiative on objective material and technical conditions. Therefore, they only see things and not people.

The subjective initiative of the people is a great force. Under certain material and technical conditions, giving full play to this force, and combining subjective initiative with the objective possibilities of material and technical conditions, can achieve an all-round leap forward that is more, faster, better and more economical and safe. Whoever cannot see this force, or underestimates this force, or even doubts this force, and does not take it as one of the bases when making plans, will inevitably fall into the quagmire of right-leaning conservatism. Believing in the masses, boldly including the masses' technological innovation and technological revolution proposals in the plan, and then going to the forefront of production, and working with workers and technicians to do everything possible to realize these proposals, can fully mobilize the masses' subjective initiative and better complete the production plan. This is an experience of the sustained and comprehensive leap forward of the Beijing Civil Lighting Fixture Factory.

    不可缺少的依据
    王朴
    我们在订计划的时候，既要充分考虑物质技术条件的客观可能性，又要充分考虑人民群众革命干劲的主观能动性，把两者结合起来。这样订出的计划，才是又先进又可靠的。可是并不是所有人都这样了解的，甚至还有人认为，如果把人的主观能动性也作为订计划的根据之一，是有点儿冒险的。他们的说法是：主观能动性不能列入计划。事情是这样吗？
    北京民用灯具厂的例子，说明了完全不是这样。这个厂每个月都考虑到职工群众在技术革命方面的主观能动性的伟大潜力，按照需要和可能，提出超过国家计划20％至30％的跃进计划。有的车间的百分比还要大。如第三车间，10月份按照现有的人力、技术条件和一般常规，即按照现有物质技术条件，在有些人看来，生产五千盏灯网还有困难，可是，他们充分考虑了职工群众的主观能动性和技术革新的潜力以后，却订了一个生产四万五千盏灯网的跃进计划。结果怎么样呢？结果是，不但产量指标完成了，废品率和成本也都比9月份降低了。一点儿冒险也没有。
    像北京民用灯具厂的例子，在去年大跃进和今年的继续跃进中，是屡见不鲜的。然而，为什么有些同志总觉得“主观能动性不能列入计划”呢？
    从根本上讲，恐怕还是群众观点没有在他们脑子里扎根。我们所讲的人的主观能动性，并不是哪一个人，或者哪一部分人的，而是人民群众的。在工矿企业里，就是职工群众的。人民群众的主观能动性，并不是虚无飘渺的。改革工具，改革设备，改革生产方法，改革产品设计，改革劳动组织，提高技术熟练程度，提高对客观事物发展规律的认识，等等，都是人的主观能动性的具体表现，都是可以计算的。把人的主观能动性列入计划，也就是把人们在生产中可能实现的技术革新和技术革命，可能掌握的新技术、新经验、新方法，列入计划。而这些也不是凭空设想出来的，而是经过人们对客观事物的发展作了科学的分析，从现有客观条件出发，估计经过努力，什么能够做到，什么暂时办不到之后，才提出来的。这完全是有据可查，有根可寻的。那些在订计划时不考虑人的主观能动性，觉得把人的主观能动性作为计划的一个依据是不可靠的人，实质上就是不相信群众。他们没有把人看做生产力中最积极的因素。他们只相信客观物质技术条件的作用，不相信人的主观能动性对客观物质技术条件的积极的反作用。所以，他们又是只见物不见人的。
    人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的力量。在一定的物质技术条件下，充分发挥这个力量，把主观能动性和物质技术条件的客观可能性结合起来，才能实现多快好省和安全的全面跃进。谁要是看不见这个力量，或者低估这个力量，甚至怀疑这个力量，订计划的时候，不把它作为依据之一，谁就必然掉进右倾保守的泥坑里去。相信群众，大胆地把群众的技术革新和技术革命建议列入计划，然后走到生产第一线去，和工人、技术人员一道，千方百计地实现这些建议，就能充分地调动群众的主观能动性，更好地完成生产计划。这便是北京民用灯具厂持续的全面跃进的一个经验。
