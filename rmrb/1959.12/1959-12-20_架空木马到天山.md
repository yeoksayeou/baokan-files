    Overhead Wooden Horse to the Tianshan Mountains

    Workers at the Tianshan Forest Farm in Aksu, Xinjiang, have successfully used the single-rail overhead wooden horse for transporting timber in the Xiaxiong Ravine operating area of the Tahelake forest region, a method created by workers at the Hongqi Forest Farm of the Tieli Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang.

    The slopes in the Xiaxiong Ravine operating area are steep, and the ravines have perennial streams, with large water volume in the summer. Previously, timber transportation methods such as wooden chutes, ice chutes, and horse-drawn paths were tried, but none were successful due to the complex terrain and climatic conditions. The single-rail overhead wooden horse for timber transportation is not restricted by terrain or climate and can operate year-round. The wooden horse travels at a speed of 20 meters per second over long distances, carrying one cubic meter of timber at a time, which can save labor and animal power. It is easy to build, simple to operate, and safe to produce. In the process of promotion, the workers of the Tianshan Forest Farm have made improvements on the original, and the wooden horse and the track frame are all made of wood, which is very strong without using a single nail, reducing construction costs and saving the country a lot of metal materials.

    架空木马到天山
    新疆阿克苏天山林场职工在塔合拉克林区瞎熊沟作业区，使用黑龙江铁力林业局红旗林场职工创造的单轨架空木马运材，已经获得成功。
    瞎熊沟作业区山坡陡峭，山沟里常年流水，夏季水势较大。以前采用过木滑道、冰滑道、马拉道等集运材方法，因为地形复杂和气候条件影响都没有成功。单轨架空木马集运材，不受地形、气候限制，可以常年作业。木马在长距离运行中每秒速度二十米，一次装运一立方米木材，可以节省劳力和畜力，修建容易，操作简单，生产安全。天山林场职工在推广过程中，在原来基础上作了改进，木马和轨架全部采用木结构，不用一个铁钉也非常坚固，降低了修建成本，为国家节约许多金属器材。
