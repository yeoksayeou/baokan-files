　　Xinhua News Agency, December 21st - The China Peace Committee and the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee today jointly sent telegrams to the Japan Peace Committee and the Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee, requesting them to forward the message to the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," supporting the Japanese people's tenth unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The telegram reads as follows:

　　Based on the significant achievements of the Japanese people's nine unified actions, they are now holding the tenth national unified action to crush the aggressive schemes of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, which will more powerfully demonstrate the will and determination of the Japanese people to oppose the revival of militarism and the U.S.-Japan military alliance. Your struggle has won universal praise and support from the people of Asia and the world. The Chinese people once again congratulate the Japanese people on the progress of their just struggle and wish you new and greater achievements in the upcoming tenth unified action.

　　Disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people and the broad masses of Asian and African people, the Kishi Nobusuke group in Japan is intensifying its suppression and persecution of the Japanese people's just movements against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and has brazenly announced that it will go to the United States in January next year to sign this aggressive military alliance treaty that sells out the interests of the Japanese nation and opposes the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all of Asia. U.S. imperialism is also increasingly bolstering Kishi Nobusuke's position, with the U.S. government openly clamoring that the so-called Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has "very important significance" for the United States. This further nakedly exposes the collusion of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. At the same time, this also once again clearly reveals the ferocious face of the United States under its recent mask of peace. This sinful act of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries not only threatens the interests and security of the broad masses of the Japanese people, but also seriously threatens peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, it will inevitably be met with stronger opposition from the Japanese people, the Asian people, and all peace-loving people in all countries of the world who oppose aggression.

　　U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. Opposing the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' intensified revival of Japanese militarism and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world are the common tasks of the Chinese and Japanese people. In the just struggle of the Japanese people for this just cause, the Chinese people will always stand closely with you and fight together. We firmly believe that the Japanese people, who have become stronger in the struggle, will surely unite more closely, advance courageously, and wage unremitting struggles to smash all obstacles and sabotage of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 21st - The All-China Women's Federation today sent a telegram to the Federation of Japanese Women's Organizations, requesting it to forward the message to the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," expressing support for the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　The telegram stated that the Japanese people and women, regardless of the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government's barbaric persecution and bloody suppression, continue to launch the tenth national unified action, which is larger in scale and more extensive and profound. Chinese women express their heartfelt admiration and wish the Japanese people and women's struggle new victories.

　　我国和大、亚非团结委员会和妇联发出电报
    支持日本人民第十次统一行动
    中日两国人民一起反对日本军国主义复活
    新华社21日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会今天联名打电报给日本和平委员会和日本亚非团结委员会，并请它们转致日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，支持日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的第十次统一行动。电文如下：
    日本人民在九次统一行动取得重大成就的基础上，现在又为粉碎美日反动派的侵略阴谋而举行第十次全国统一行动，将更有力地显示出日本人民反对军国主义复活、反对日美军事同盟的意志和决心。你们的斗争获得了亚洲和世界人民普遍的赞扬和支持。中国人民再一次祝贺日本人民正义斗争的进展，并预祝你们在即将到来的第十次统一行动中获得新的更大的成就。
    日本岸信介集团不顾日本人民和广大亚非人民的反对，正加紧镇压和迫害日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的正义运动，并悍然宣布要在明年1月去美国签订这一出卖日本民族利益、与中国、苏联和全亚洲人民为敌的侵略性的军事同盟条约；美帝国主义也更变本加厉地为岸信介撑腰，美国政府公然叫嚷所谓日美“安全条约”对美国有“非常重要的意义”。这进一步露骨地暴露了美日反动派狼狈为奸的阴谋。同时，这也再一次明显地揭露了美国在最近一个时期，在和平假面具下的凶恶面目。美日反动派这一罪恶行为不仅威胁着日本广大人民的利益和安全，而且严重威胁着远东和世界的和平，因此，定将遭到日本人民、亚洲人民和世界各国一切反对侵略和爱好和平人民的更强烈的反对。
    美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，反对美日反动派加紧复活日本军国主义和保卫远东和世界和平是中日两国人民的共同任务。在日本人民为了这一正义事业所进行的正义斗争中，中国人民将永远同你们紧密地站在一起共同奋斗。我们坚信，在斗争中锻炼得更坚强的日本人民，一定会更加团结一致，勇往直前地进行不懈的斗争，粉碎美日反动派的一切阻挠和破坏，最后的胜利必将属于日本人民。
    据新华社21日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天打电报给日本妇女团体联合会，并请它转致阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，表示支持日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    电文说，日本人民和妇女不顾岸信介反动政府的野蛮迫害和血腥镇压，继续展开规模更加巨大，更加广泛深入的第十次全国统一行动。中国妇女谨表示衷心的敬佩，并祝日本人民和妇女的斗争取得新胜利。
