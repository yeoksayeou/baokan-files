    Jilin Focuses on Water Conservancy Construction with Flood Control as the Priority
    Jiangsu Coordinates Unified Planning and Comprehensive Management
    (Our newspaper, Changchun, 2nd dispatch) A water conservancy construction upsurge, focusing on fundamentally controlling waterlogging, has been vigorously launched in the vast rural areas of Jilin Province.
    Although the farming season is later in Jilin's rural areas, and they are currently rushing to thresh, deliver grain, and prepare the land, in order to achieve even greater harvests next year, all localities have quickly mobilized forces and successively launched a water conservancy construction upsurge.
    This winter and next spring's water conservancy construction in Jilin Province will focus on controlling waterlogging. The province has more than 800,000 hectares of low-lying and flood-prone cultivated land. Although great efforts have been made to manage it in recent years, the standards are low and large floods cannot be controlled. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all localities to strive to improve flood control standards through this winter and next spring's water conservancy construction upsurge and eradicate waterlogging as soon as possible. Focusing on controlling waterlogging, continue to complete several key projects. All localities are launching a large number of small and medium-sized projects, while also maintaining and improving existing projects.
    As of November 25, 410,000 people in the province had participated in water conservancy construction, vigorously promoting high work efficiency campaigns. Work efficiency has increased more than six times compared to the same period last year. More than 12 million cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed, and 820 large and small projects such as ponds, dams, reservoirs, and wells have been built. The province's largest Xinlicheng Reservoir and the large-scale Shanmen Reservoir were also closed and began storing water in early November. At present, both the number of people involved in water conservancy construction and construction efficiency are increasing daily.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing) People's communes in various parts of Jiangsu Province have once again demonstrated unparalleled superiority in winter water conservancy construction.
    Relying on the people's communes to manage water not only means more people and greater momentum, and faster project progress, but also effectively solves the contradictions between regions, between upstream and downstream areas, and between drainage and irrigation, achieving unified planning and comprehensive management. The Changjiang People's Commune in Jiangning County has land close to the Yangtze River that is high-lying; the polder area is further away from the river and low-lying. Whenever the polder fields are planted with seedlings, water needs to be diverted from the river to irrigate them, but the dry crops grown on the high-lying land are afraid of water. During waterlogging, the polder area has to drain water through the high-lying land, which worsens the waterlogging situation there. Therefore, there are often conflicts between the polder area and the high-lying land. Now the commune has unified planning, adjusted the irrigation system, and organized large-scale labor cooperation, with the high-lying land helping the polder, and the polder helping the high-lying land. Winter water conservancy construction is already underway across the board.
    Communes running water conservancy projects can also independently and self-reliantly solve the problems of funds and materials. The Guanshan People's Commune in Suining County needs more than 6,000 cubic meters of stone, 450 tons of lime, 130 tons of cement, and 90,000 yuan in funds for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring. Because there are commune-run industries, materials such as stone, cement, and lime are completely self-sufficient. The entire commune has raised 70,000 yuan in water conservancy construction funds, and with careful planning, all funding issues can be resolved. Thanks to the full support of commune-run industries, the Zhu Town Commune in Liuhe County has realized mechanization of excavation and blasting, vehicle loading, and rail transport of earth at the Daheqiao Reservoir construction site. The average daily work efficiency per person reaches 5.3 cubic meters. (Attached picture)

### 吉林以治涝为重点兴修水利  江苏各地统一规划综合治理

    吉林以治涝为重点兴修水利
    江苏各地统一规划综合治理
    本报长春2日电　以根治内涝为重点的水利建设高潮，已在吉林省广大农村中蓬勃展开。
    农事季节较晚的吉林农村，虽然正在突击打场、送粮和整地，但是为了明年获得更大丰收，各地都迅速调兵遣将，相继掀起水利建设高潮。
    吉林省今冬明春水利建设以治涝为重点。全省有八十多万公顷低洼易涝耕地，几年来虽经大力治理，但标准较低，还不能控制较大涝灾。中共吉林省委指示各地，力争经过今冬明春水利建设高潮，提高治涝标准，早日根治涝灾。围绕治理内涝，继续完成几项重点工程。各地都兴办大量中小型工程，同时维护和提高已有工程。
    截至11月25日，全省已有四十一万人参加水利建设，大搞高工效运动，工效比去年同时期提高六倍以上，已经完成一千二百多万土石方工程量，建成塘坝、水库、井泉等大小工程八百二十处，全省最大的新立城水库和大型的山门水库，也于11月初合拢蓄水。目前，无论水利建设人数或施工效率，都在与日俱增。
    据新华社南京讯　江苏省各地人民公社在冬修水利建设中，又一次显示出无比优越性。
    依靠人民公社治水不但人多势重，工程进展快，而且有效地解决了地区之间，上下游之间，以及排水和灌溉之间的矛盾，做到统一规划，综合治理。江宁县长江人民公社洲地紧靠长江，地势高亢；圩区离江较远，地势低洼。每当圩田栽秧时，要从洲地引江水灌溉，但洲地种的旱谷怕水。在内涝时，圩区又要经过洲地排涝，加重了洲地的涝情，因此圩区与洲地时常有矛盾。现在公社统一规划，调整了灌溉系统，组织劳力大协作，洲帮圩，圩帮洲，冬修水利已经全面施工。
    公社办水利还能自立更生地解决资金、器材问题。睢宁县官山人民公社今冬明春水利建设需要石料六千余立方米，石灰四百五十吨，水泥一百三十吨，经费九万元。因为有了社办工业，做到石头、水泥、石灰等材料完全自给。全公社已筹集水利建设资金七万元，精打细算，可以解决全部资金问题。六合县竹镇公社由于社办工业的全力支持，在大河桥水库工地上实现了挖土爆破化，装土车子化，运土轨道化，平均每人日工效达五点三立方米。（附图片）
