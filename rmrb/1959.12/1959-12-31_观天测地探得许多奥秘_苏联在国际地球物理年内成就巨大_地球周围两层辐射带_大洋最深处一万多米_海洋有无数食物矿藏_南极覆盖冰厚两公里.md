　　Observing the Sky and Measuring the Earth Reveals Many Mysteries: The Soviet Union Achieves Great Successes During the International Geophysical Year
    Two Layers of Radiation Belts Around the Earth, Ocean Depths of Over 10,000 Meters, Oceans Contain Countless Foods and Minerals, Antarctica Covered by Two Kilometers of Ice

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 29th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article by Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician Belousov on the 28th, introducing the great achievements made by the Soviet Union during the International Geophysical Year.

    Belousov said that Soviet scientists have obtained completely new materials regarding the Earth's magnetic field. The third Soviet artificial satellite discovered that there are inner and outer radiation belts around the Earth. The outer radiation belt is composed of high-speed electrons and extends to a height of ten Earth radii. The inner radiation belt, closer to Earth, has also been studied. These materials are of great significance for studying auroras and magnetic systems.

    Careful research has been conducted on nuclear transformation processes occurring in the sun. Through this research, changes in ionized gases in magnetic fields can be determined, which is of great use for controlling thermonuclear reaction research.

    For the first time in the history of meteorology, daily weather charts were drawn on a global scale. New data on atmospheric currents were obtained at altitudes of fifteen to thirty kilometers above the Northern Hemisphere, and strong winter winds flowing from west to east at speeds of two to three hundred kilometers per hour were discovered at an altitude of thirty kilometers. In addition, the meteorological role of Antarctica was clarified for the first time. There is no reverse airflow over Antarctica, but drastic atmospheric movements can be observed. The influence of the Antarctic climate can sometimes extend to the entire Earth. Soviet scholars have conducted in-depth research on the ocean, discovering that the deepest part of the ocean is over 11,000 meters, and also discovering new underwater mountain ranges and seabed depressions. Soviet scientists have also discovered that the speed of underwater currents is ten to twenty times faster than previously assumed. Rapid exchange of water flow between various oceans was discovered. This proves that the claim by some scholars in the United States and Western Europe that radioactive materials released into the ocean can be isolated is incorrect.

    Soviet oceanographers concluded from their research that the ocean contains countless foods and minerals, and the ocean floor concentrates large amounts of manganese, cobalt, nickel, and many rare elements.

    The Earth's poles are not in a fixed position but are changing, and the Earth's rotation is sometimes slightly faster and sometimes slightly slower. Soviet scientists have conducted research of great significance on these phenomena.

    Scientists observed that the intensity of cosmic rays increases sharply an average of four times a year.

    When writing about the "permanent" ice layer on Earth, the article said that if all the ice in the polar oceans were to melt, the world's ocean level would rise by fifty-four meters. Currently, the ice layer on the Earth's surface is shrinking, and the thickness of the ice layer covering Antarctica has been determined to have an average thickness of two kilometers, and in some places, four kilometers. Moreover, Soviet scientists have been the first to map one-third of the Antarctic coastline.

　　观天测地探得许多奥秘  苏联在国际地球物理年内成就巨大
    地球周围两层辐射带　大洋最深处一万多米  海洋有无数食物矿藏　南极覆盖冰厚两公里
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联“真理报”28日发表了苏联科学院院士别洛乌索夫的一篇文章，介绍苏联在国际地球物理年内取得的巨大成绩。
    别洛乌索夫说，苏联科学家获得了关于地球磁场的全新的材料。第三个苏联人造卫星发现在地球周围有内外两层辐射带。外辐射带是由高速运动的电子组成，它一直扩展到离地球十个半径的高空。对离地球较近的内辐射带也进行了研究。这些材料对于研究极光和磁系具有重要的意义。
    对太阳中发生的核变过程进行了仔细的研究，通过这种研究可以查明电离气体在磁场中的变化，对于控制热核反应的研究工作有很大的作用。
    在气象学历史上第一次绘制了全球范围的每日气象图表。在北半球上空十五到三十公里地方获得了大气流的新材料，在三十公里高处发现了从西向东、以每小时二百到三百公里的速度流动的强烈的冬季风。另外第一次弄清楚了南极在气象上的作用。在南极上空不存在反气流，但是可以观察到大气的剧烈的流动。南极气候的影响有时可及于整个地球。苏联学者对海洋作了深刻研究，发现了大洋最深的地方是一万一千多米，还发现了新的水下山脉和海底洼地。苏联科学家们还发现了在海洋下面的水流速度比过去所假设的要快十到二十倍。发现了各个海洋间的水流迅速交换。因此证明，美国和西欧的一些学者认为，在海洋中投下的放射性物质可以隔离起来的说法是不正确的。
    苏联海洋学家根据研究得出结论认为，海洋里蕴藏着无数的食物和矿藏，海洋底部集中着大量锰、钴、镍以及许多稀有元素。
    地球两极不是处在一个固定位置上而是在变动的，地球自转有时稍快有时稍慢，对这些现象苏联科学家进行了具有重要意义的研究。
    科学家观察到宇宙射线的强度平均每年有四次强烈的增加。
    文章在写到地球上的“永久”冰层时说，两极海洋的冰如全部溶化，那末世界上海洋水平将升高五十四米。现在，地球表面上的冰层正在缩小，南极复盖冰层的厚度已经确定，它的平均厚度达两公里，有的地方达四公里。而且，苏联科学家已首先绘制成了三分之一南极沿海地带的地图。
