    American Expansion into the Western European Market
    Soviet Union, Zhamatov
    While striving to intensify its expansion into the markets of economically underdeveloped countries, American imperialism is also trying to expand its sphere of influence in industrialized countries.

    The purpose of the American economic expansion into Western Europe is not only to enable monopoly organizations to obtain maximum profits (American capital obtains higher profits in Western Europe than from domestic investment in the United States), but also to deepen the political dependence of Western European countries on the United States. These countries occupy a prominent position in America’s plans to contend for world hegemony.

    In recent years, Western European countries have accounted for approximately 30% of American export trade.

    During the post-war period, a considerable portion of American exports to Western Europe were paid for with various "aid" funds. From July 1, 1945, to December 31, 1958, Western European countries received approximately two-thirds of the total American foreign "aid," i.e., $45 billion out of $70 billion. The United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and Italy received the most funds. Although American statistical agencies have not published the amount of military "aid" given to each country, it is known that 60% of the "aid" to the entire Western European region is officially recognized as being of a military nature.

    In 1949, the "Marshall Plan" funds accounted for more than 70% of American export trade to the United Kingdom, approximately 65% to Italy, and approximately 90% to the Netherlands. It is no exaggeration to say that during the implementation of the "Marshall Plan," trade between the United States and Western Europe was basically carried out within the scope of this plan.

    In the initial post-war years, the huge state loans and grants given to Western European countries under the "aid" plan enabled American monopoly organizations to achieve extremely large export volumes to Western European countries, which were severely lacking in goods during this period. The export volumes that the United States achieved in trade with the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg at that time have not even been exceeded since.

    In the initial post-war years, American government loans and grants guaranteed that American monopoly organizations sold large quantities of raw materials, grain, and fuel to Western European countries at high prices. Monopoly organizations, under the banner of selflessly participating in the restoration of the European economy, sought to consolidate their position in Western Europe. In reality, while providing "aid" to Western European countries, the United States did not provide them with the necessary industrial equipment, thus hindering their economic recovery. In addition, the American ruling clique prohibited the use of American "aid" to build new enterprises and expand existing ones. During this period, the amount of equipment provided was less than 12% of the total American "aid" (excluding weapons). All of this shows that the true purpose of the American ruling clique in pursuing this policy was to deliberately make Western European countries dependent on American goods, thereby creating the best conditions for the penetration of American capital into these countries' markets.

    After the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, the United States turned to a policy of overt military adventurism, which led to the policy of developing Western European military industries replacing the policy of undermining Western European industrialization. While maintaining a monopoly on the production of nuclear weapons, rockets, and the latest aircraft, the United States turned to intensifying the export of equipment and various new weapons for military enterprises producing conventional weapons to Western Europe. During this period, the focus shifted to providing only military "aid" to Western European countries.

    Direct military "aid" remains the main part of American "aid" under the "Mutual Security" plan. In 1958, direct military aid almost exceeded so-called non-military grants by four times.

    Selling weapons and military enterprise equipment guaranteed extra operating rates for the largest monopoly organizations in the American military industry and the sale of products to the government at high prices.

    While selling weapons and military equipment to Western European countries, the United States also demanded that they increase military spending. The direct military "aid" provided by the United States between 1950 and 1958 was approximately $14.6 billion, while the direct military expenditures of the European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization during the same period exceeded $100 billion.

    While forcing Western European countries into an arms race that consumed their export resources, the United States weakened their position in international trade and seized their traditional markets. Those countries that accepted American "aid" were not allowed to use the funds from this "aid" to subsidize and compensate enterprises that were forced to reduce the production of export commodities due to the increased operating rates caused by military orders.

    American "aid," which was conditional on purchasing American goods, enabled American exports to Western European countries to reach a high level. In such exports, weapons, grain, tobacco, cotton, coal, oil and petroleum products, metals, and chemical products occupied a major position. Although American economic "aid" to Western Europe has been reduced recently, a considerable portion of the grain and raw materials exported to Western Europe is still heavily subsidized by the American government.

    In recent years, due to the renewal of fixed capital in Western European countries, American exports of equipment to these countries have continued to increase. The quantity of equipment provided to enterprises controlled by American capital accounts for a considerable share of the exported equipment.

    According to estimates, the total output of enterprises controlled by American capital in Western Europe, Asia, Africa, Canada, and Latin America is approximately twice the total American exports and three times its exports of industrial products. In some Western European countries, the quantity of manufactured goods produced by enterprises controlled by American capital is much greater than the quantity of goods exported by the United States to these countries. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, this product, calculated by value, exceeds twice the total American exports to this country.

    In a series of Western European countries, enterprises controlled by American capital account for as much as half or more of the output in certain (and dominant) industrial sectors (such as machinery manufacturing, automobiles, the chemical industry, etc.). Taking the United Kingdom as an example, enterprises controlled by American capital produce more than 50% of its national output of tractors, oil drilling equipment, wind-powered machine tools, cranes, typewriters, cameras, and more than 70% of synthetic detergents, sewing machines, printing equipment, shoemaking machines, carbon black production equipment, and dry food production equipment.

    American monopoly organizations regard direct investment as the main means of seizing foreign markets. In the post-war period, they have greatly expanded, and are still continuing to expand, the network of Western European enterprises that they control. Private direct investment is mainly invested in the automobile industry, general machinery manufacturing, the oil processing industry, the chemical industry, the metallurgical industry, and the electrical machinery manufacturing industry. Now American companies are showing the greatest interest in the electronics industry and the chemical industry (especially the petrochemical industry). Overall, American direct investment in Western European countries has more than tripled compared to before the war.

    When investing in the Western European economy, the United States often strives to obtain national treatment for American capital. Funds from the American government's "aid" plan guarantee that monopoly organizations' investments in Western European countries are safe and sound, and that profits can be repatriated in US dollars. The so-called counterpart funds (funds established in the local currencies of relevant countries using American "aid") have been spent in vast amounts to expand American capital-controlled enterprises in Western Europe. As of June 30, 1958, these funds in Western European countries totaled approximately $11 billion.

    In order to strive for the most favorable conditions for American export trade and American capital-controlled enterprises, the American government insists that Western European countries abolish tariff barriers, import restrictions, and foreign exchange restrictions, and that they continue to pursue trade discrimination policies against socialist countries that are unfavorable to themselves, and so on.

    In order to make these countries minimize trade barriers, the United States used multilateral agreements signed within the scope of the "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade." President Eisenhower once admitted: "Between 1953 and the beginning of 1955, Western Europe reduced 60% of the quantity restrictions on goods imported from the United States. Without the 'General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,' it would have been much more difficult to force these countries to relax this control."

    While demanding that Western European countries greatly reduce tariffs, the United States only makes tariff concessions on the import of raw materials necessary for the United States to establish strategic reserves, or maintains the existing and original tax-free import system for certain commodities. Even in individual cases where the United States has made concessions, these concessions are often much smaller than what the United States has obtained from European countries. In addition, agreements signed by the United States within the scope of the "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" usually include various clauses such as "escape clauses," "danger points," and "defensive revisions," which may restrict imports, thereby nullifying the concessions made by the United States.

    American monopoly organizations have high hopes for the establishment of the Western European "Common Market." The United States formed the Organization for European Economic Cooperation and the European Payments Union based on the multilateral agreements signed under the "Marshall Plan." According to the intentions of American monopoly capitalists, the task of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation should be to organize a unified market in Western European countries and eliminate trade and monetary barriers that restrict the economic expansion of American monopoly organizations. Due to the formation of the "Common Market" by the six Western European countries—West Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—the expansion policy of American monopoly organizations has entered a new stage.

    For small American companies, the establishment of the "Common Market" means a drastic reduction in sales in this region (approximately 80%). However, large American monopoly organizations that have a network of branch enterprises in Europe have benefited from the establishment of the "Common Market." These monopoly organizations are trying to gain a foothold in the markets of Western European countries and are expanding, renovating, and reorganizing their enterprises located in Western Europe and establishing new enterprises.

    In order to increase investment in the "Common Market" countries, the United States established a "European Fund Company" in early 1959. The purpose of this company is to attract American private capital to invest in the securities of Western European countries.

    American monopoly organizations have shown great interest in West Germany. At the end of 1958, there were more than 400 branch enterprises of American companies in West Germany. The American capital flowing into Belgium and the Netherlands has also increased. From October 1957 to September 1958, twenty-four new branch enterprises of American companies were established in Belgium, bringing the total number to two hundred and eighty. In 1958, twenty-seven American branch companies were established in the Netherlands, while the average annual number was less than seven between 1955 and 1957. American monopoly organizations use capital output as the main means of expanding into the "Common Market" countries.

    Therefore, the United States uses its economic superiority over Western European countries to try to influence them more. However, unlike the early post-war period, the current American expansion into the Western European market is being carried out under intense competition. Western European countries, disregarding the pressure from the American ruling clique, are renewing equipment and modernizing production, thereby increasing the competitiveness of Western European goods. Now, many Western European goods are no less in quality than American goods, and they are also cheaper. Not long ago, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine wrote: "The competitive situation of American industry is changing. Foreign competitors, especially Western European opponents, are attacking very quickly. The era when American enterprises had an advantage and it was easy to expand the market has been replaced by an era of ruthless competition. The era when American companies penetrated foreign markets unhindered has passed."

    In the current stage of the general crisis of capitalism, the intensification of the uneven development of capitalist countries has deepened the resistance of Western European countries to the expansion behavior of American monopoly capital. Businessmen in Western European countries are more actively opposed to American "aid," opposed to American capital holding key economic sectors in their countries, and are striving to increase European exports to the United States. In addition, the struggle to restore trade with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is also constantly strengthening.

    美国对西欧市场的扩张
    苏联　扎赫马托夫
    美帝国主义一方面竭力加紧向经济不发达国家市场进行扩张，同时并力图在工业发达的国家中扩大自己的势力范围。
    美国对西欧的经济扩张，目的不仅是要使垄断组织获取最大限度的利润（美国资本在西欧所获得的利润高于美国国内投资的利润），而且还在于加深西欧国家对美国的政治依赖性。这些国家在美国争夺世界霸权的计划中占有显著的地位。
    最近几年中，西欧各国在美国出口贸易中所占的份额，约为30％。
    战后时期，美国对西欧的输出，有相当大一部分是用各种“援助”款项来支付的。西欧国家自1945年7月1日起到1958年12月31日止，大约获得了美国外“援”总额的三分之二，即获得了七百亿美元中四百五十亿美元。英国、法国、西德和意大利得款最多。美国的统计机构虽然没有公布给予各国的军事“援助”数额，但是大家知道，在对整个西欧地区的“援助”中，有60％的款项，是官方承认具有军事性质的。
    1949年，“马歇尔计划”的拨款，占美国对英国出口贸易的70％以上，对意大利——约为65％，对荷兰——约为90％。可以毫不夸大地说，在“马歇尔计划”执行期间，美国与西欧的贸易，基本上是在这个计划的范围之内进行的。
    在战后最初年代中，根据“援助”计划给予西欧国家的巨额国家贷款和补助金，使美国垄断组织在这一时期内，对极端缺乏商品的西欧国家的出口额达到了非常庞大的程度。当时美国在同英国、法国、比利时、卢森堡的贸易中所达到的出口额，甚至以后也没有超过。
    战后最初几年内，美国的政府贷款和补助金，保证美国垄断组织在西欧国家高价出售了大量的原料、粮食和燃料。垄断组织打着无私地参加恢复欧洲经济的旗帜，以图巩固其在西欧的地位。实际上，美国在给予西欧国家以“援助”的同时，却不对它们提供其必需的工业设备，因而阻碍了它们的经济恢复工作。此外，美国统治集团还禁止利用美国“援助”来建设新的企业和扩建原有的企业。在这一时期内，设备提供量不及美“援”总额（未算武器）的12％。所有这些都说明，美国统治集团奉行这种政策的真实目的，是蓄意要使西欧国家依靠美国的商品，从而为美国资本对这些国家市场的渗透创造最好的条件。
    侵朝战争爆发后，美国转向公开的军事冒险政策，这使发展西欧军事工业的政策取代了破坏西欧工业化的政策。美国一方面保持核武器、火箭以及最新飞机生产的垄断，同时转而加紧对西欧输出生产常规武器的军火企业设备和各种新式武器。在这一时期内，重点转到只向西欧国家提供军事“援助”方面。
    直接军事“援助”至今仍然是美国按“共同安全”计划的“援助”的主要部分。在1958年内，直接军事援助差不多超过了所谓非军事补助金的四倍。
    出售武器和军事企业设备，保证了美国军事工业中最大垄断组织的额外开工率和高价向政府销售产品。
    美国在对西欧国家销售武器和军事装备的同时，还要求它们增加军费。美国在1950—1958年间提供的直接军事“援助”约为一百四十六亿美元，而欧洲的北大西洋公约成员国在同一时期内的直接军费则超过了一千亿美元。
    美国一方面强迫西欧国家进行耗费其出口资源的军备竞赛，同时削弱它们在国际贸易中的地位和强占它们的传统市场。那些接受美“援”的国家，不得利用这种“援助”的资金来补助和补偿那些由于军事定货增加开工率而被迫缩减出口商品生产的企业。
    以购买美国商品为先决条件的美“援”，使美国对西欧国家的出口达到了高度的水平。在这种出口中，武器、粮食、烟草、棉花、煤炭、石油和石油制品、金属及化工产品占主要地位。美国给予西欧的经济“援助”近来虽已削减，但是向西欧输出的相当多一部分粮食和原料，仍然得到美国政府的大量资助。
    近年来由于西欧国家固定资本的更新，美国对这些国家输出的设备还在不断增加。给美国资本控制的企业提供设备数量，在出口设备中占相当大的份额。
    根据估计数字，可以认为，美国资本在西欧、亚洲、非洲、加拿大和拉丁美洲控制的企业的总生产量约为美国出口总额的两倍，而为其出口工业品的三倍。在某些西欧国家里，美国控制的企业生产的制成品数量，比美国输往这些国家的还要多得多。以英国为例，这种产品按价值计算，超过了美国对这个国家出口总额的两倍。
    在一系列西欧国家里，美国资本控制的企业在某些（而且是主导的）工业部门（如机器制造、汽车、化学工业等）的产量中所占份额，高达一半甚至一半以上。以英国为例，美国资本控制的企业生产了占其全国产量50％以上的拖拉机、石油钻探设备、风动机床、起重机、打字机、照像机，以及70％以上的合成洗涤剂、缝纫机、印刷设备、制鞋机、炭黑生产设备和干粮生产设备。
    美国垄断组织把直接投资作为侵占国外市场的主要手段，在战后已经大大扩展，而且现在仍在继续扩展它们所控制的西欧企业网。私人直接投资主要是投入汽车工业、一般机器制造业、石油加工工业、化学工业、冶金工业和电机制造工业部门。现在美国公司对电子工业和化学工业（特别是石油化学工业）显示了最大的兴趣。整个说来，美国在西欧各国的直接投资，比战前增加了两倍以上。
    美国向西欧经济投资时，常常力求使美国资本取得国民待遇。美国政府“援助”计划中的资金，保证垄断组织在西欧国家投资安全无恙，并能以美元汇回利润。在扩大美国资本在西欧控制的企业方面，曾经耗费了为数甚巨的所谓对等基金（利用美“援”以有关国家的本国货币设立的基金）。在1958年6月30日，西欧国家的这种基金，共达一百一十亿美元左右。
    为了力求给予美国出口贸易和美国资本控制的企业以最有利的条件，美国政府坚持要求西欧国家取消关税壁垒、进口限制和外汇限制，并要它们继续推行不利于自己的对社会主义国家的贸易歧视政策，等等。
    美国为了使得这些国家最大限度地减少贸易壁垒，利用了在“关税及贸易总协定”范围内签订多边协定。艾森豪威尔总统曾经承认：“在1953年到1955年年初期间，西欧曾经减低了自美国进口商品的60％的数量限制，如果没有‘关税及贸易总协定’，要想迫使这些国家放松这种控制，将会困难得多。”
    美国一方面要求西欧国家大大降低关税，而自己却仅在进口美国建立战略储备所必需的那些原料方面，给予关税上的让步，或者维持现行的和原有免税进口某些商品的制度。即使在个别情况下美国作出了让步，但这种让步也往往比美国从欧洲国家所得到的要小得多。此外，美国在“关税及贸易总协定”范围内所签订的协定，通常都包括“逃避条款”、“危险点”、“防卫修正”等各种条款，它有可能限制进口，从而使美国所作的让步化为乌有。
    美国垄断组织对建立西欧“共同市场”抱有很大的希望。美国根据“马歇尔计划”签订的多边协定，组成了欧洲经济合作组织和欧洲支付同盟。按照美国垄断资本家的意图，欧洲经济合作组织的任务应该是组织西欧国家的统一市场，并消除这些国家限制美国垄断组织进行经济扩张的贸易壁垒和货币壁垒。由于西欧六国——西德、意大利、法国、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡——“共同市场”的组成，美国垄断组织的扩张政策进入了一个新的阶段。
    对于美国的小公司来说，“共同市场”的建立，就意味着对这个地区销售量剧烈缩减（80％左右）。而在欧洲开设有分支企业网的美国大垄断组织，却由于建立“共同市场”而得到了好处。这些垄断组织力图在西欧各国市场上站稳脚跟，正在扩大、更新和改组自己设在西欧的企业和建立新企业。
    为了增加对“共同市场”各国的投资，美国在1959年年初成立了一个“欧洲基金公司”。这家公司的目的是吸收美国私人资本来对西欧国家的有价证券进行投资。
    美国垄断组织对西德表现了极大的兴趣，1958年年底，西德境内共有四百多个美国公司的分支企业。流入比利时和荷兰的美国资本也增加了。从1957年10月至1958年9月，比利时又新建了二十四个美国公司的分支企业，其总数达到二百八十个。1958年内，在荷兰设立了二十七个美国分公司，而1955—1957年内，每年平均尚不到七个。美国垄断组织利用资本输出作为向“共同市场”国家进行扩张的主要手段。
    因此，美国利用自己对西欧国家的经济优势，力图使它们受自己更多的影响。但是，和战后初期不同，美国目前对西欧市场的扩张是在激烈竞争的情况下进行的。西欧国家不顾美国统治集团的压力，进行设备更新和生产的现代化，因而使西欧商品的竞争能力提高了。现在，许多西欧商品在质量上不亚于美国的商品，而且价钱还更便宜。不久以前“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志写过：“美国工业的竞争状况正在变化，外国竞争者，特别是西欧的对手进攻得非常迅速。美国企业占优势而且易于扩大市场的时代，已经为无情的竞争的时代所代替。美国公司向外国市场渗透无阻的时代已经过去了。”
    在资本主义总危机的现阶段中，资本主义国家发展不平衡的加剧，加深了西欧国家对美国垄断资本扩张行为的反抗。西欧国家的工商界人士，更加积极地反对美“援”，反对美国资本把持他们国家的极重要经济部门，并竭力增加欧洲向美国的出口。此外，为了恢复同苏联和其他社会主义国家贸易的斗争，也在不断地加强。
