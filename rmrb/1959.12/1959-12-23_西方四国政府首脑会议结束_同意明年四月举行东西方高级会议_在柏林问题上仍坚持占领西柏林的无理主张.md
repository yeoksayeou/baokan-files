Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 21st: The three-day summit of the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany concluded here today.

The communique issued after the meeting stated that the heads of the Western four governments “exchanged views on various issues of common concern” during the meeting, and that “among the issues they discussed were East-West relations, disarmament, and issues related to Germany, including the Berlin issue.”

The communique emphasized that, regarding the Berlin issue, the heads of the Western four governments "reaffirmed" the "principles stipulated" in the communique of the Western four foreign ministers' meeting on December 14, 1958, and the declaration of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council on December 16, 1958, regarding the Berlin issue. As everyone knows, in these two documents, the Western countries declared that they were "determined to maintain their position and rights in Berlin, including the right of free access," and that "the Berlin issue can only be resolved within the scope of an agreement with the Soviet Union on the entire German issue." This means that the West has retreated to its stubborn position prior to the Geneva Conference, insisting on the military occupation of West Berlin and obstructing a reasonable solution to the West Berlin issue.

Regarding the issue of an East-West summit, the communique expressed unanimous agreement to hold a four-power summit of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France with Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev. The communique also stated that Eisenhower, Macmillan, and de Gaulle had written to Khrushchev, "proposing that such a meeting begin in Paris on April 27th next year."

According to American news agencies, Eisenhower also stated in his letter to Khrushchev: "We have agreed that it is appropriate for the four heads of state or government to meet from time to time in their respective countries to discuss major issues concerning the realization of world peace and stability." However, White House spokesman Hagerty stated on the 21st that whether a second East-West summit would be held would depend on the "progress made" at the first meeting, and that the future US President would not be bound by any obligations.

The communique did not indicate the West's views on the issues of disarmament and East-West relations. The foreign ministers of the five Western countries (US, UK, France, Italy, Canada) in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee of East and West met in Paris today and issued a communique stating that they had decided to propose to the five socialist countries in the committee that the first meeting of the committee be held in Geneva on or around March 15th next year. The five Western countries will first meet in Washington in January next year to propose a Western plan. However, although the West has recently talked a lot about disarmament being the primary issue at the East-West summit, the "New York Herald Tribune" admitted that the United States has not yet resolved "what it can do" on the issue of disarmament.

A communique on economic issues was also issued along with the meeting communique. According to Western news agencies, the Western heads of government discussed economic issues on the morning of the 20th, and Macmillan raised the issue of the confrontation between the six-nation "Common Market" and the seven-nation "Free Trade Association" at the meeting. This communique on economic issues announced that the Western four heads of government agreed to hold an informal meeting in Paris in the near future, with the participation of several Western countries, to discuss trade issues arising from the "existence" of the "Common Market" group and the "European Free Trade Association" group, as well as the so-called issue of "aid" to underdeveloped countries.

　　西方四国政府首脑会议结束
    同意明年四月举行东西方高级会议
    在柏林问题上仍坚持占领西柏林的无理主张
    据新华社巴黎21日电　美国、英国、法国和西德四国政府首脑为期三天的会议今天在这里结束。
    会后发表的公报说，西方四国政府首脑在会议过程中“就共同关心的各项问题交换了意见”，“在（他们）讨论的问题中有东西方关系、裁军和包括柏林问题在内的有关德国的问题”。
    公报着重说明，关于柏林问题，西方四国政府首脑“重申”在1958年12月14日西方四国外长会议公报和北大西洋公约组织理事会1958年12月16日关于柏林问题的宣言中所“规定的原则”。大家知道，西方国家在这两个文件中曾经声明，它们“决心保持它们在柏林的地位和权利，包括自由出入的权利”，“柏林问题只能在同苏联就整个德国问题取得协议的范围以内解决”。这就是说，西方已经后退到它们在日内瓦会议以前的顽固立场，坚持对西柏林的军事占领，阻挠西柏林问题的合理解决。
    在谈到东西方最高级会议问题时，公报表示一致同意同苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫举行一次苏美英法四国政府首脑会议。公报还说，艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和戴高乐已经写信给赫鲁晓夫，“建议明年4月27日在巴黎开始举行这样一次会议”。
    据美国通讯社报道，艾森豪威尔在写给赫鲁晓夫的信件中还说：“我们商定，四位国家或政府首脑不时在各自的国家聚会，来讨论关于实现世界和平和稳定的主要问题是适宜的”。但是，白宫发言人哈格蒂在21日又表示，第二次东西方最高级会议是否召开将取决于第一次会议“取得的进展”，未来的美国总统不承担任何义务。
    公报没有表明西方对于裁军问题和东西方关系问题的观点。东西方十国裁军委员会中的五个西方国家（美、英、法、意大利、加拿大）的外长今日在巴黎开了会并且发表公报说，它们决定向委员会中五个社会主义国家建议在明年3月15日或这个日期前后在日内瓦举行这个委员会的第一次会议，西方五国将在明年1月在华盛顿先行开会以便提出西方方案。但是，尽管西方最近大谈裁军问题是东西方最高级会议上的首要问题，“纽约先驱论坛报”却承认，美国现在连在裁军问题上“能做些什么”还没有解决。
    同会议公报一起发表的还有一个关于经济问题的公报。据西方通讯社报道，西方政府首脑们在20日上午讨论了经济问题，麦克米伦在会上提出了六国“共同市场”和七国“自由贸易联盟”的对垒问题。这个关于经济问题的公报宣布，西方四国政府首脑同意在最近的将来在巴黎举行一次有若干西方国家参加的非正式会议，来讨论由于“共同市场”集团同“欧洲自由贸易联盟”集团的“存在而产生的贸易问题”以及所谓“援助”不发达国家问题。
