　　Zhejiang's Experience in High-Speed Development of Animal Husbandry
　　Zheng Ping, Director of the Animal Husbandry Production Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee

　　Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, the Provincial Party Committee, and Party committees at all levels, Zhejiang Province's animal husbandry production, like other productions, has achieved a continued leap forward victory. Compared with the end of May, the number of pigs in stock at the end of November increased by 42.7%, poultry increased by 83%, and livestock and poultry such as cattle, sheep, and rabbits also developed rapidly. At present, more than 500 production teams in the province have achieved one pig per mu of cultivated land. Organs, troops, schools, factories, and urban residents have also started to raise livestock and poultry. A situation in which the whole Party and the whole people are engaged in animal husbandry centered on pig raising has been formed and is continuing to develop.
    Strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, resolutely implementing the Party's line, principles and policies, and constantly opposing right-leaning tendencies and inspiring enthusiasm are the fundamental guarantees for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. After the Provincial Party Committee convened the Provincial Animal Husbandry Production Work Conference in May this year, Party leadership over animal husbandry production was generally strengthened in various places. In most counties, the secretary took the lead and established offices or headquarters. Communes, management districts, production teams, and production brigades generally established animal husbandry production groups to specifically lead animal husbandry work. At the same time, various places also transferred a group of Party members, League members, and activists to enrich and strengthen the animal husbandry production front, and reorganized the organization, cleared and adjusted a group of landlords, rich peasants, and people who were not suitable for animal husbandry work. This greatly strengthened the Party's leadership over animal husbandry production and provided an organizational guarantee for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. Practice over the past year has proved that to develop animal husbandry production at high speed, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link, promoting both grain and livestock," and "combining public and private raising, with public raising as the main focus." After the Provincial Animal Husbandry Production Work Conference in May this year, various places resolutely implemented the policy of walking on two legs, combining public and private raising, thereby greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses for developing animal husbandry production and setting off a wave of enthusiasm for developing livestock and poultry in every commune, every team, every household, every factory, every organization, and every school. From June to August, the province averaged a monthly increase of 160% in livestock and poultry. After the Provincial Party Committee convened the second Animal Husbandry Production Work Conference in August, various places, based on the new situation, conscientiously implemented the policy of combining public and private raising, with public raising as the main focus, and set off a wave of vigorously running livestock farms at all levels. After the Provincial Party Committee pointed out the agricultural production policy of "taking grain as the key link, promoting both grain and livestock, comprehensive development, and overall balance" according to the instructions of the Central Committee, the development of animal husbandry production in the province was even faster, and a new leap forward climax appeared. Countless facts have proved that wherever the Party's line, principles and policies are resolutely implemented, animal husbandry production can develop greatly; wherever the Party's line, principles and policies are not resolutely implemented, animal husbandry production cannot leap forward, and some even decline. For example, Xinchang Commune and Chengtan Commune in Sheng County are both semi-mountainous areas with roughly the same conditions in terms of land and labor. Historically, Xinchang Commune's pig-raising production was better than Chengtan Commune's. However, because Chengtan Commune implemented the policy of walking on two legs, the current number of pigs in stock has increased by 37.2% compared with the end of 1958, while Xinchang Commune, because it did not actively develop collective breeding and public pig raising only accounted for 5.6%, the number of pigs in stock decreased by 15% compared with the end of 1958.
    Adhering to the Party's line, principles and policies, and striving for a great leap forward in animal husbandry production is by no means smooth sailing, but is achieved in the sharp struggle between two roads and two lines. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, large-scale socialist education movements were carried out in various places, thoroughly criticizing the right-leaning thoughts such as "grain and livestock cannot be promoted at the same time," "public raising is not as good as private raising," "more raising is not as good as less raising," fearing "death," fearing "losses," fearing "no feed," and "there are no conditions for running large-scale livestock farms," thereby removing the ideological obstacles to striving for a continued leap forward in animal husbandry production this year. At the same time, because the high-speed development of animal husbandry production is an important part of accelerating socialist construction, collective livestock farms were once subjected to the rampant attacks of a few rich middle peasants and right-leaning opportunists who represented capitalist spontaneous forces. They advocated dissolving the livestock farms and distributing the livestock to households, and even a few landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements who had infiltrated the livestock farms attempted to sabotage them by various malicious means. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses defended the Party's animal husbandry cause and the Party's general line, and at the same time, resolutely dealt with a group of landlords, rich peasants, and various bad elements mixed in collective livestock farms. After this sharp and complex struggle, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and masses for developing animal husbandry production was greatly improved. According to statistics from the three special districts of Jinhua, Ningbo, and Jiaxing, more than 27,000 livestock farms were established in less than three months. During the five-level cadre meeting in Ningbo Special District, 200,000 sows were selected and retained in three days. In the province, from the beginning of October to November 15, the average monthly net increase rate of pigs was 1.7 times higher than that of February to September this year.
    Adhering to the mass line and launching a large-scale mass movement is the fundamental method for high-speed development of animal husbandry production. Countless facts
  prove that where the masses are fully mobilized, the momentum of the movement is great, and it is carried out vigorously, animal husbandry production is fast; where the masses are not well mobilized, the movement lacks momentum, and it is carried out coldly and quietly, animal husbandry production develops slowly. After the Provincial Animal Husbandry Production Work Conference in August, various places widely and deeply carried out
  a propaganda and education movement to vigorously develop animal husbandry production, using various forms of propaganda to make the Party's line, principles and policies on animal husbandry production deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and known to every household. And adopted methods such as airing views and debates, oath-taking rallies, on-site visits, inspections and evaluations, etc., to carry out a large-scale "learn from the advanced, surpass the advanced, and help the backward" competition movement in animal husbandry production, which powerfully promoted the great leap forward in animal husbandry production. The Jinyun County Party Committee seized the two model production teams of Majiakeng Production Team, which raised an average of 1.74 pigs per mu last year and had a grain yield of 1,341 jin per mu, and Tianliao Production Team, which raised an average of 1 pig per mu last year and had a grain yield of 1,238 jin per mu, and launched communes, production teams, and production brigades to run pig farms in a big way, and launched a "learn, catch up, surpass, and help" pig-raising movement throughout the county. By the end of November, there were 45 production teams in the county that raised an average of more than one pig per mu, including 10 production teams that raised more than two pigs per mu. By November 9, 660 pig farms had been established in the county, raising 96,803 pigs, an increase of 12,792 pigs compared with the end of September. In the movement to oppose right-leaning and boost morale, Huangyan County put forward the combat slogan of "Use the energy of running steel in a big way to vigorously develop animal husbandry production, use the speed of building small blast furnaces to build livestock farms in a big way, use the spirit of going up the mountain to find iron sand to vigorously develop feed, and use the determination of sleeping in front of the furnace, eating in front of the furnace, and not stopping until molten iron flows out to do a good job in feed management." The secretary took the lead and mobilized the whole Party and the whole people to run livestock farms in a big way, vigorously grasping sow breeding and making green storage feed. In the three days from November 18 to 20, 769 livestock farms were established, 7,426 sows were selected and retained, and 130 million jin of green storage feed were made. In the vigorous competition movement, some advanced units carried forward the communist style of helping the backward in a big way.
    Adhering to the "Eight-Character Charter" (种, zhǒng - breeding, 繁, fán - propagation, 料, liào - feed, 栏, lán - pen, 管, guǎn - management, 喂, wèi - feeding, 保, bǎo - protection, 工, gōng - work) for animal husbandry and implementing various advanced technical measures are important links for the rapid development of animal husbandry production. Over the past year, various places have accumulated a lot of experience in this regard, and many innovations have emerged. For example, Zhu Ruixiang, the deputy director of the Dipu Commune Livestock Farm in Anji County and a model pig farmer, created the experience of high yields for sows and rapid meat growth for meat pigs. This year, the ten meat pigs she raised mainly used green and rough feed and adopted methods such as feeding pigs based on their condition and feeding rough feed finely. After five months of feeding, the average weight reached more than 149 jin. Pan Chuanbiao, a feeder at the Tiantai County Farm, worked hard and skillfully, raising more than 200 pigs by himself, creating the experience of high efficiency in pig raising. Xu Heying, a feeder at the Lianqun Production Team Livestock Farm in Toutuo Commune, Huangyan County, learned artificial insemination. The farm only had one boar, which solved the breeding problem for more than 300 sows. Jiang Xiaomao, a beekeeper at the Zhaixi Commune Beekeeping Team in Tonglu County, studied diligently and mastered beekeeping technology. He adopted methods such as overwintering with strong colonies, making his ten colonies of bees produce an average of 1,400 jin of honey per colony, creating a national high-yield record for bees. All these advanced experiences have very important significance for promoting the development of animal husbandry production.

　　浙江畜牧业高速度发展经验
　　中共浙江省委畜牧生产委员会主任　郑平
    浙江省的畜牧业生产，在中央、省委和各级党委的正确领导下，同其他各项生产一样，取得了继续跃进的胜利。11月底同5月底比，生猪存栏头数增加42.7％，家禽增加83％，牛、羊、兔等家畜家禽，也都发展很快。目前，全省已经有五百多个生产队实现了一亩耕地一头猪。机关、部队、学校、工厂、城镇居民，也都纷纷动手，大养家畜家禽。一个全党全民大搞以养猪为中心的畜牧业的局面已经形成，并且正在继续发展。
    加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，坚决地执行党的方针政策，不断地反右倾，鼓干劲，这是高速度发展畜牧业生产的根本保证。今年5月，省委召开了全省畜牧业生产工作会议以后，各地普遍地加强了党对畜牧业生产的领导。大部分县由书记挂帅，建立了办公室或者指挥部。公社、管理区、生产队和生产小队，普遍成立了畜牧生产小组，具体领导畜牧工作。同时，各地还抽调了一批党员、团员和积极分子，充实和加强了畜业生产战线，并且整顿了组织，清除和调整了一批地、富分子，和不宜作畜牧工作的人。这就大大地加强了党对畜牧业生产的领导，为高速度发展畜牧生产提供了组织保证。一年来的实践证明，要高速度地发展畜牧业生产，必须坚决地贯彻执行“以粮为纲，粮畜并举”、“公养和私养并举，以公养为主”的方针。今年5月全省畜牧生产工作会议以后，各地坚决地贯彻了公养和私养并举的两条腿走路的方针，从而大大地调动了广大群众发展畜牧业生产的积极性，掀起了一个社社养、队队养、户户养、工厂养、机关养、学校养的发展家畜家禽的热潮。全省6到8月份平均每月增加家畜家禽160％。8月份省委第二次召开了畜牧生产工作会议以后，各地又根据新的情况，认真地执行了公养和私养并举、以公养为主的方针，掀起了各级大办畜牧场的热潮。省委根据中央指示指出“以粮为纲、粮畜并举、全面发展，综合平衡”的农业生产方针以后，全省的畜牧业生产发展更快，出现了一个新的跃进高潮。无数的事实证明，凡是坚决执行党的方针政策的地方，畜牧业生产就能够大发展；凡是不坚决执行党的方针政策的地方，畜牧业生产就跃不上去，个别的反而下降。像嵊县新昌公社与澄潭公社，都是半山区，土地、劳力等条件大致相同。在历史上，新昌公社的养猪生产比澄潭公社好。可是，由于澄潭公社贯彻执行了两条腿走路的方针，现有生猪存栏数比1958年年底增加了37.2％，而新昌公社由于没有积极发展集体饲养，公养猪只占5.6％，因而生猪存栏数反而比1958年底减少了15％。
    坚持党的方针政策，争取畜牧业生产的大跃进，绝不是一帆风顺的，而是在两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争中取得的。党的八届八中全会的决议公布以后，各地开展了大规模的社会主义教育运动，彻底地批判了“粮畜不能并举”、“公养不如私养”、“多养不如少养”，养多了“怕死”、“怕亏本”、“怕没有饲料”，“大办畜牧场没有条件”等等右倾思想，从而扫除了争取今年畜牧业生产继续跃进的思想障碍，同时由于高速度发展畜牧业生产是加速社会主义建设的一个重要组成部分，因此集体畜牧场一度遭到了少数代表资本主义自发势力的富裕中农和右倾机会主义分子的猖狂进攻，他们主张把畜牧场解散，把家畜分散到户，甚至还有少数混入畜牧场的地、富分子和坏分子，企图用种种恶毒的办法来破坏。广大群众在党的领导下，保卫了党的畜牧事业，保卫了党的总路线，同时，坚决地处理了一批混在集体畜牧场的地、富分子和各种坏分子。经过这场尖锐、复杂的斗争，广大干部和群众对发展畜牧业生产的积极性大大提高，据金华、宁波、嘉兴三个专区的统计，不到三个月的时间，就办了二万七千多个畜牧场。宁波专区在五级干部会议期间，三天中就选留了二十万头母猪。全省从10月初到11月15日的一个半月中，猪平均每月净增率比今年2至9月份提高一点七倍。
    坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动，这是高速度发展畜牧业生产的根本方法。无数事
  实证明：哪里群众发动得充分，运动的声势大，轰轰烈烈，哪里畜牧业生产就快；哪里的群众发动得不好，运动缺乏声势，冷冷清清，哪里畜牧生产发展就慢。8月间的全省畜牧生产工作会议以后，各地广泛深入地开展
  了大力发展畜牧业生产的宣传教育运动，运用各种宣传形式，使党的畜牧业生产的方针政策深入人心，家喻户晓。并且采取了鸣放辩论、誓师大会、现场参观、检查评比等办法，在畜牧业生产上大搞“学先进、超先进、帮后进”的竞赛运动，有力地促进了畜牧业生产的大跃进。缙云县委抓住马家坑生产队去年平均每亩养猪一点七四头、粮食亩产一千三百四十一斤和田寮生产队去年平均每亩养猪一头、粮食亩产一千二百三十八斤。这两个标兵，发动了公社、生产队、生产小队大办养猪场，在全县开展了一个养猪的“学、赶、超、帮”运动。到11月底，全县出现了四十五个每亩平均养猪一头以上的生产队，其中每亩养猪两头以上的就有十个生产队。到11月9日，全县已办养猪场六百六十个，养猪九万六千八百零三头，比9月底增加一万二千七百九十二头，黄岩县在反右倾、鼓干劲的运动中，提出了“用大办钢的劲头大搞畜牧业生产，用造小高炉的速度大造畜牧场，用上山找铁砂的精神大搞饲料，用睡在炉前、吃在炉前、不流铁水不收兵的决心搞好饲料管理”的战斗口号，书记带头，发动全党全民大办畜牧场。大抓母猪留种，大搞青储饲料，在11月18日到20日三天内就办起了畜牧场七百六十九个，选留了母猪七千四百二十六头，青储饲料一亿三千万斤。在轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动中，有些先进单位发扬了大帮后进的共产主义风格。
    坚持畜牧业的“八字宪法”（种、繁、料、栏、管、喂、保、工），贯彻各项先进技术措施，是迅速发展畜牧业生产的重要环节。一年来，各地在这方面积累了不少经验，并出现了很多创造。像安吉县递铺公社畜牧场副场长、养猪模范祝瑞香，创造了母猪多胎高产和肉猪快速长肉的经验，今年她养的十头肉猪，以青粗饲料为主，采用看猪配料、粗料细喂等办法，饲养五个月，平均体重达到一百四十九斤多。天台县农场饲养员潘传表，苦干巧干，一人养猪二百头以上，创造了养猪高工效的经验。黄岩县头陀公社联群生产队畜牧场饲养员徐荷英，学会人工授精，全场只有一头公猪，解决了三百多头母猪的配种问题。桐庐县窄溪公社养蜂队养蜂员江小毛，刻苦钻研，掌握了养蜂技术，采用强群越冬等办法，使饲养的十群蜂，平均每群产蜜一千四百斤，创造了全国蜜蜂高产纪录。所有这些先进经验，对于促进畜牧业生产的发展，有着十分重大的意义。
