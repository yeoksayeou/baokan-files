Xinhua News Agency, December 27th - Under the active leadership of the Communist Youth League Central Committee and organizations at all levels, and with the assistance of trade union organizations, the national movement of young workers to enter 1960 at high speed has achieved great victory. As of early December, more than nine million young workers with quotas or calculable workloads and two hundred thousand youth collectives across the country have completed this year's workload ahead of schedule. Among them, more than 100,000 people were three months ahead, more than 1 million people were two months ahead, more than 3 million people were one month ahead, and more than 5 million people were more than 20 days ahead. A total of 286 million workdays were gained. Other young workers without quotas and young workers in various production support departments and service industries also actively participated in the movement, creating extremely favorable conditions for the high-speed leap forward of production workers. At present, the broad masses of young workers across the country are advancing victoriously, throwing themselves into a new battle to seize a flying start, an all-round red, and a year-long red in next year's production.

The Party's leadership is the decisive factor in the victory of the movement to enter 1960 at high speed. This movement emerged after the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced in August this year, amid a surge of the movement to increase production and practice economy among the broad masses of workers across the country, and became an integral part of the national movement to increase production and practice economy. From the very beginning of the movement, it received the Party's strong leadership. The Party committees of Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Anshan, and other provinces, cities, and factory enterprises gave great attention to the movement, and constantly gave detailed instructions on the direction and content of the movement. Under the leadership of the Party, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels, with the posture of revolutionary promoters, enthusiastically organized and promoted this movement. This movement was also warmly supported by trade union organizations and adult and veteran workers. Many Communist Youth League cadres and trade union cadres in factory enterprises worked together to vigorously strengthen ideological and organizational work for young workers. Many provincial and municipal Communist Youth League organizations and trade unions in Xi'an, Shenyang, and other places jointly held mobilization meetings for youth skills competitions and technological innovation, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of young people. The enthusiastic guidance and assistance of adult and veteran workers enabled the desire of young workers to surpass time at high speed to be quickly realized. The director of the ironmaking workshop of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant personally participated in the technical performance competition, using his many years of experience to demonstrate and address the problems in the operation of young workers, improving the technical level of young workers and inspiring their enthusiasm for studying ironmaking production. Many adult, veteran workers, and technical personnel actively participated in organizations such as "three-way combination innovation teams," acting as technical instructors, helping young people come up with ideas, find tricks, and make innovations.

The fact that millions of young workers have completed the 1959 workload ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota shows that the broad masses of young people have further accepted the idea of high-speed construction. Through studying the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of young workers deeply realized that "to produce a high-speed leap forward, we must first arm ourselves with high-speed thinking." Therefore, they actively armed their minds with the general line and established the ambition to quickly change the poor and blank backwardness of our country. Millions of young workers actively carried out a heated revolutionary competition to learn from the advanced and strive for the top. In the competition, many people were willing to "give convenience to others and leave difficulties to themselves"; "go forward when encountering difficulties, give up honors, learn from the advanced, and help the backward." Moving deeds of "not letting a partner fall behind" and striving for collective leap forward appeared everywhere.

Young workers call technological innovation and the promotion of advanced experience "two wings for flying over time." In the activities to strive to complete the 1959 workload ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, the broad masses of young workers carried out large-scale skillful work activities, making breakthroughs in production bottlenecks, promoting advanced experiences in batches, and rapidly improving technical levels. Technical performance competitions have recently become a common form of skillful work activities. In Liaoning Province, more than 90% of young workers have participated in the upsurge of everyone performing, everything performing, and repeated performances. The Jinan Match Factory originally had only 10% of young workers who had completed this year's workload ahead of schedule. After carrying out technical performance competitions and widely promoting five advanced experiences, the production efficiency of each young worker increased by 10% to 15%, and all 241 young workers in the factory have now completed this year's workload ahead of schedule. At the same time, young workers in Shenyang, Tianjin, Kaifeng, and other places put forward slogans such as "Throw away the old ox and ride a fast horse, mechanize manual labor," "Eliminate the myth of manual work, fitters operate machines," and "Put down the sledgehammer and move towards mechanization," and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, they revolutionized manual operation, greatly promoting the early completion of production plans.

Now, the broad masses of young workers across the country have put forward new goals: to strive to be the shock force for a flying start in production in 1960. They are working together with all the staff to actively carry out various production preparations.

　　要高速度跃进，先要用高速度的思想武装自己
    九百万青工跨进新的一年
    二十万个青年集体同时提前完成今年工作量
    广大青工决心夺取明年开门红全面红全年红
    新华社27日讯　在共青团中央和各地组织的积极领导和工会组织的协助下，全国青年职工高速度跨进1960年的运动，取得了巨大胜利。到12月上旬止，全国已有九百多万有定额或可计算工作量的青年工人和二十万个青年集体，提前完成了今年工作量。其中有十万多人提前了三个月，一百多万人提前了两个月，三百多万人提前了一个月，五百多万人提前了二十天以上。总共赢得了两亿八千六百万个工作日。其他没有定额的青年职工和各生产辅助部门、以及服务性行业的青年职工，也积极参加了运动，为生产工人的高速度跃进创造了极为有利的条件。目前，全国广大青年职工正乘胜前进，投入夺取明年生产开门红、全面红、全年红的新的战斗。
    党的领导是高速度跨进1960年运动取得胜利的决定因素。这个运动，是在今年8月党的八届八中全会的决议公布以后，在全国广大职工掀起了增产节约运动的情况下出现的，成为全国性的增产节约运动的一个组成部分。运动一开始，就得到了党的强有力的领导。上海、天津、沈阳、鞍山和其他各省、市以及厂矿企业党委都对运动给予极大的关怀，对运动的方向和内容不断作出详尽的指示。各地共青团组织在党的领导下，以革命促进派的姿态，满腔热情地组织和推进了这一运动。这个运动也受到了工会组织和成年、老年工人的热烈支持。许多厂矿企业的共青团干部和工会干部一起，大力加强了对青年工人的思想工作和组织工作。西安、沈阳等许多省市团组织和工会联合召开青年比武和技术革新的动员大会，大大激发了青年的干劲。成年和老年职工的热心指导和帮助，使青年工人高速度超越时间的愿望迅速得到实现。本溪第一钢铁厂炼铁车间主任亲自参加技术表演赛，针对青年工人操作中的问题用自己多年的老经验作示范，提高了青工的技术水平，并且鼓舞了他们钻研炼铁生产的热情。许多成年、老年职工、科室技职人员积极参加“三结合革新队”等组织，充当技术指导，帮助青年出主意，找窍门，闹革新。
    几百万青年职工提前超额完成1959年工作量，表明广大青年进一步接受了高速度建设的思想。广大青年职工通过对党的八届八中全会决议的学习，深刻地认识到：“要生产高速度跃进，首先要用高速度思想武装自己。”因此，纷纷以总路线武装自己的思想，树立起迅速改变我国一穷二白落后面貌的雄心大志。千百万青年职工积极开展了热火朝天的学先进、争上游的革命竞赛。在竞赛中，许多人都勇于“把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己”；“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见落后就帮”。到处出现“不让一个伙伴掉队”，力争集体跃进的动人事迹。
    青年职工们，把技术革新和推广先进经验，称为“飞越时间的两个翅膀”。在争取提前超额完成1959年工作量的活动中，广大青年职工大规模地开展了巧干活动，使生产关键纷纷突破，先进经验成批推广，技术水平迅速提高。技术表演赛，在最近时期成为巧干活动的普遍形式。辽宁省有90％以上青工投入了人人表演、事事表演、反复表演的热潮。济南火柴厂原来只有10％青工提前完成了今年的工作量，在开展技术表演赛普遍推广五项先进经验以后，每个青工的生产效率都提高10％到15％，全厂二百四十一名青工现在全部提前完成了今年的工作量。在这同时，沈阳、天津、开封等地青工提出“抛下老牛骑快马、手工劳动机械化”，“破除手工迷、钳工开机器”，“放下大锤把、走向机械化”等口号，在党委统一领导下革手工操作的命，大大推动了提前完成生产计划。
    现在，全国广大青年职工提出了新的奋斗目标：争当1960年生产开门红突击手。他们正在同全体职工一起，积极进行各项生产准备工作。
