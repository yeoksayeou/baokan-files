　　Hog Raising Experience Exchange: One Sow Produces Nine Litters in Three Years
    Giving Birth to a Total of 108 Piglets, All Fat and Strong
    Li Xiuzhen, a hog raiser at the hog farm of Lu Village Brigade, Miaohuang Commune, Shilong County, Guangxi, used a combination of boar inducement and traditional Chinese medicine to induce estrus, creating a record of one sow producing nine litters in three years, giving birth to a total of 108 piglets, all surviving and thriving, with an average weight of about 20 jin at weaning.
    Li Xiuzhen is an outstanding hog raising expert. She meticulously raised and managed a sow in a special pen that the agricultural cooperative had given her for experimentation. By using a combination of boar inducement and traditional Chinese medicine to induce estrus, she successfully bred the sow on November 19, 1956. On March 24, 1957, the sow gave birth to eleven piglets. On April 5 of the same year, she again showed signs of estrus and was bred, giving birth to a second litter of ten piglets on July 19. On August 5, she again showed signs of estrus and was bred, giving birth to a third litter of twelve piglets on November 25. From November 1956 to November of this year, she has given birth to nine litters in three years, totaling 108 piglets, averaging three litters per year and twelve piglets per litter.
    Li Xiuzhen took meticulous care of the piglets. She fed the sow more concentrated feed to increase nutrition, ensuring that the piglets had enough milk to eat. In order to reduce the burden on the sow and promote the healthy growth of the piglets, she fed the piglets thin porridge once a day in the evening, and separated the piglets from the sow at night. After four or five days, the piglets could go without nursing from the sow at night. Separating the piglets from the sow at night allowed the sow to be bred earlier, and the piglets also lived normally under careful care.

　　养猪经验交流一头母猪三年产九胎
    共生小猪108头个个肥壮
    广西石龙县妙皇公社路村大队养猪场的饲养员李秀珍，采用公猪诱情和土药催情相结合的办法，创造了一头母猪三年产九胎，共生小猪一百零八头，头头成活、个个肥壮，断奶时的体重一般在二十斤左右。
    李秀珍是一个出色的养猪能手。她把农业社给她作试验的一头母猪专栏管理，精心饲养。采用公猪诱情和土药催情相结合的办法，使这头母猪在1956年11月19日配上了种，到1957年3月24日生小猪十一头；同年4月5日又发情配种，到7月19日下第二胎生小猪十头；8月5日又发情配种，11月25日下第三胎生小猪十二头。从1956年11月到今年11月，三年时间共生九胎，得小猪一百零八头，平均每年三胎，每胎生小猪十二头。
    李秀珍护理小猪很周到。她给母猪多吃些精料，增加营养，使小猪有足够的奶吃。为了减轻母猪的负担和促进小猪生长健壮，她每天晚上给小猪喂一次稀粥，并把小猪和母猪分开睡觉，这样有四、五天，小猪就可以夜间不吃母猪的奶了。小猪和母猪分开睡，母猪就能提早配种；小猪在周到的照料下也生活正常。
