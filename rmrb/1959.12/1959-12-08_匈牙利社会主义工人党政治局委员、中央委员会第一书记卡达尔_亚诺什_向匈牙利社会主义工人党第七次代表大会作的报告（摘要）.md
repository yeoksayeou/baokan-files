Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 8th

The Political Bureau member and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, János Kádár, reported to the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on behalf of the Central Committee. In his report, he first pointed out that at the party member meetings and party representative conferences convened to prepare for this congress, everyone fully agreed with the Central Committee's directive on the congress. Party members unanimously and resolutely carried out this policy. Therefore, it can be said that today the Central Committee and all party members are united. The unity of our party is strong and unbreakable.

He said: In the socialist labor competition launched to welcome this congress, apart from the Communist Party members who initiated the competition, tens of thousands of non-party members, workers, peasants, and intellectuals also participated. They contributed to the realization of the goals of our party congress through their labor and creation. This fact has great political significance. It itself brilliantly proves that today in our country, the party has close ties with the masses, and the great power of the party and the people united under the banner of socialism.

He proposed that the task of this congress is to sum up the party's struggle experience and propose future tasks. Although there are still shortcomings in the work of the Central Committee, it can report to the congress with a clear conscience because the policies it has implemented have been proven correct. Just by comparing the serious situation of the Hungarian People's Republic three years ago with today's consolidated situation, we can confidently regard this overall achievement as a historic victory for the party, the working class, the Hungarian people, and the socialist revolution.

He also expressed deep gratitude to the various communist and workers' parties, the peoples of the socialist countries, and the awakened workers and progressive people of the world for their assistance to Hungary.

In the first part of his report, Kádár explained Hungary's foreign policy and the international situation.

He said, the goal of our country's foreign policy is to defend the great achievements of our people and ensure the peaceful construction of socialism. The basic principles of our foreign policy are: Hungarian-Soviet friendship, loyalty to the socialist camp, opposition to imperialism, and peaceful coexistence with all countries and peoples regardless of social systems.

Kádár said, the Hungarian people can proudly regard the Soviet Union, which is implementing the seven-year plan and building communism, as the strongest force for human progress and world peace. In recent years, the Soviet Union has achieved the construction of the Bratsk hydroelectric station, atomic power stations, the Lenin-class atomic icebreaker, and in just two years, it has launched three artificial satellites and three intercontinental rockets, one of which has sent the Soviet emblem to the moon, and another has photographed the far side of the moon, which humans have never seen before. In the peaceful competition, the decisive advantage of the Soviet Union lies in its superior socialist society, which provides endless possibilities for development. The Soviet Union has set the goal of surpassing the most developed capitalist country, the United States, in terms of per capita production and consumption by 1970. Today, no serious political factor in the world can doubt that this goal will be achieved. The Hungarian working people sincerely wish the Soviet people an early and complete victory in the peaceful competition.

He recalled the long-standing friendship between Hungary and the Soviet Union, especially how the Soviet Union drove the Nazi-Fascist forces out of Hungarian territory and how the Soviet people, without regard for their own lives, liberated the Hungarian people from the yoke of the invaders. He also expressed that the Hungarian people will forever remember with gratitude the assistance provided by the Soviet Union in response to the request of the revolutionary government of workers and peasants in 1956, which helped to prevent capitalism and fascism from reimposing themselves on the Hungarian people and turning our country into an imperialist military corridor and battlefield.

He said, in the past fifteen years, the Soviet Union has twice proven its deep friendship and internationalism towards the Hungarian people with the blood of its children. During these fifteen years, it has also helped the Hungarian people recover from the wounds of war and build socialism in various ways. A few years ago, the enemies of the Hungarian people and the Soviet people slandered the Soviet Union for "exploiting" our country. The stupidity of this slander has become so obvious that even the enemies themselves now admit that the economic relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary are more beneficial to Hungary.

Kádár contrasted the economic relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary with the trade relations between capitalist great powers and small countries. He said: The economic relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary and other socialist countries are not based on commercial profit principles but are relations of selfless and sacrificial brotherly aid provided by a more powerful and long-standing socialist country. In the 1958 trade volume, 82% of the goods supplied by the Soviet Union to Hungary were raw materials and semi-finished products. The raw materials such as iron ore, oil, and timber supplied by the Soviet Union to Hungary accounted for the vast majority of the imported raw materials needed by the Hungarian national economy. While in 1958, 58% of the commodities supplied by Hungary to the Soviet Union were machine industry products and precision machinery products. This is the situation of trade between a socialist great power, the Soviet Union, and a smaller socialist country, Hungary.

There has never been a capitalist great power that, in developing trade with a small country, mainly exports raw materials on favorable terms while importing mostly industrial products. This practice is contrary to the essence of capitalism, which lies in exploiting not only its own people but also the people of other countries. They call the former "freedom of enterprise and employment" and the latter "free trade," and together they form the "free world."

He emphasized that today, Hungarian-Soviet friendship is strong. This friendship is the source of strength, a great pillar, and a guarantee of prosperity for the Hungarian people. Continuously strengthening Hungarian-Soviet friendship and maintaining this eternal and unbreakable friendship is the most important task of our party and government's foreign policy.

He also pointed out that Hungary has good friendly relations with the socialist camp countries, including the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Albania, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Polish People's Republic, the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of Romania, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and is advancing together in close unity.

Kádár said, we are pleased to see that the countries of the socialist camp are vigorously working and achieving new and great victories on the road to socialism. Ten years ago, the anti-imperialist people's liberation war in China achieved victory, and then the socialist revolution was carried out, which itself greatly changed the political landscape of the world. A country with a population of 650 million people transformed from an area exploited by international imperialism into a socialist great power. Its example and unprecedented rapid development are inspiring and encouraging. The example of China also proves the superiority of the socialist system and the infinite creativity of the people who have been liberated from oppressors. China has overcome unprecedented difficulties, making last year's grain production 2.5 times that of 1949, coal production 9 times, oil production 19 times, and pig iron production 40 times.

He said, the solid and unbreakable foundation of the unity of the socialist camp is the common socio-political system, the common path of socialist construction, the common worldview, and the common efforts to defend peace. The principles guiding cooperation within the socialist camp are not only equality, territorial integrity, respect for national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs, but also further mutual assistance. In his speech in Berlin, Khrushchev eloquently expressed this, saying that in our camp, the principle of "I for everyone, everyone for me" prevails. The socialist camp, with the Soviet Union as its core and leading force, is today the main force for world progress and peace. The Hungarian People's Republic is an equal and respected member of the socialist camp. To faithfully serve the vital interests of our people, the foundation of our foreign policy should continue to be the strengthening of the power and unity of the socialist camp and the resolute repulsion of all attempts to harm this power and unity.

Kádár expressed Hungary's desire to establish good relations with all neighboring countries and peoples. He mentioned that since August 1953, Hungary's relations with Yugoslavia have gradually normalized, although this relationship deteriorated significantly between 1956 and 1958 and has since shown some slow improvement. He said, the possibility of establishing normal, friendly relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia still exists. However, due to Yugoslavia's attacks on our friends, such as the recent attacks on the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Albania, difficulties have increased.

Kádár, in pointing out that the Austrian government has allowed various plots of the Western bloc hostile to the Hungarian People's Republic to influence its policy, has consistently tolerated espionage agencies and Hungarian fascist organizations to carry out various activities against the Hungarian People's Republic on its territory, which has seriously affected bilateral relations, he said, the Hungarian People's Republic has no real contradictions with Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, and other European neutral countries. We strive to improve relations with them.

When talking about relations with Asian and African countries, Kádár said that in the past ten to fifteen years, the peoples of countries such as India, Indonesia, Iraq, and the United Arab Republic have freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism and embarked on the path of independent national development, which is considered one of the most important events of the contemporary world. Our relations with these countries are good, and we strive to further improve these relations. We stand with them in opposing imperialism; we hope to expand economic and cultural relations with them. The Hungarian People's Republic can also make a certain contribution to the development of their independent industries.

He said: We fully sympathize with the peoples of various countries who are fighting to free themselves from colonial rule. We condemn the terrorist war against the Algerian people and support their struggle for self-determination, which we consider a completely reasonable demand. The Hungarian people angrily condemn the struggles being waged in the indivisible parts of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, South Korea, South Vietnam, and the imperialist colonial oppression and terrorist acts against the people of South Africa and other places.

We believe that imperialism can no longer stop the process of struggle for liberation and independence; the just struggle of the colonized peoples for liberation will definitely be victorious.

Kádár talked about the relations between the Hungarian People's Republic and the leading countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and their governments, describing them as unsatisfactory. Kádár said, we have particularly serious contradictions with the government of the United States of America.

Kádár exposed the attempts by the United States to subvert the Hungarian people's government and interfere in Hungarian internal affairs. He said, a considerable part of the $125 million annual budget of the U.S. Senate is used to carry out sabotage activities against the Hungarian People's Republic. The U.S. military has recruited 5,000 Hungarian refugees. They have set up the so-called "Free Europe" radio station to launch incitement attacks against the Hungarian People's Republic. Although we have diplomatic relations, the official representatives of the U.S. government oppose the representative rights of the official representatives of the Hungarian People's Republic in the United Nations and other international organizations, which is unprecedented. The U.S. reactionary clique attempts to use the anti-Hungarian resolutions of the United Nations to achieve the purpose of interfering in our internal affairs. The ridiculous anti-Hungarian movements stirred up every year around this resolution serve the purposes of anti-Soviet and Cold War. We do not and will not recognize this illegal resolution that violates the United Nations Charter.

He said, despite this, we sincerely hope to establish normal relations between the United States of America and the Hungarian People's Republic. However, the essence of the matter is that the U.S. government must adhere to the principle of equality and abandon all attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic.

Kádár then condemned West Germany for intensifying its military buildup, ignoring everything in its efforts to maintain the Cold War. The Hungarian people oppose West German aggression and fully support the peaceful policy of the German Democratic Republic. The goals of the Hungarian People's Republic and the first workers' and peasants' state in Germany, the German Democratic Republic, are completely consistent. We congratulate them on their great achievements in socialist construction. We are pleased that the German Democratic Republic is making rapid progress and will soon surpass and exceed the Federal Republic of Germany in terms of per capita production and consumption. We wish the working people of the German Democratic Republic new achievements in socialist construction, strengthening the state, and implementing policies aimed at defending peace and bringing the two Germanys closer together.

Kádár talked about the international situation, saying that in the past two to three years, the international situation has eased to a certain extent. The decisive reason for this change is the growth of the strength of the Soviet Union, the socialist camp, the international workers' movement, and the world peace movement. However, the anti-peace forces active in capitalist countries and international life and exerting influence should not be overlooked. Therefore, the peoples of all countries must continue to resolutely fight against the anti-peace forces and force them to retreat.

Kádár pointed out the important achievements of Khrushchev's visit to the United States, which was welcomed by peace-loving people around the world. He said, the Soviet Union's proposal for general disarmament in the United Nations is a prominent event. Comrade Khrushchev and President Eisenhower agreed in their agreement that international disputes must be resolved through negotiations. This agreement is of great significance.

Our task is to effectively promote our peaceful goals in unity with the Soviet Union and all countries of the socialist camp. In the relations between countries and nations, we support the full implementation of the principle of peaceful coexistence. We support the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the establishment of nuclear-free zones, and the prohibition and destruction of nuclear weapons. We support the proposal to solve the Berlin problem and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. We support the Soviet Union's proposal for general disarmament and support the transitional measures before this proposal is implemented, such as reducing the number of troops, abolishing foreign military bases, and mutual withdrawal of troops stationed abroad. Public opinion in various countries is urging negotiations and agreements. The peoples of various countries yearn to eliminate destructive weapons and demand general disarmament. The Hungarian people also demand to be able to use their strength for the great work of peaceful construction. He said, we advocate the realization of peaceful coexistence through the gradual expansion of international contacts.

In the second part of his report, Kádár talked about the domestic situation of the Hungarian People's Republic.

Kádár said, in the past three years, the trend of domestic political development has been healthy, and this development has greatly consolidated our system. The struggle against the counterrevolution has tempered and united the socialist forces. The broad masses have made great political progress and gained rich experience in class struggle. In this process, the all-people's unity of our country has been further strengthened on the basis of socialist ideology. This unity is born in historical progress. Today, this new national unity is stronger than ever before.

Kádár talked about the counterrevolutionary uprising in Hungary in 1956 and, based on the opinion of the Party Central Committee, analyzed in detail the nature and causes of the incident. He pointed out that the armed uprising that broke out in Budapest on October 23, 1956, and all actions aimed at disrupting the state and social order of the Hungarian People's Republic were aimed at opposing the rule of the working class, opposing the people's state, and opposing the socialist struggle achievements of the Hungarian people, and were therefore of a bourgeois counterrevolutionary nature.

He said, the mistakes made by Rákosi and his group were an important factor. These mistakes were particularly evident in ignoring the specific conditions and national characteristics of the country, and therefore, after a certain period, they proved unable to correctly apply the international general laws of building socialism in our country. These mistakes were also evident in the destruction of party democracy, the violation of socialist legality, and the distortion of economic policy. Due to the seriousness and persistence of the mistakes, the inability to correct the exposed and recognized mistakes weakened the dictatorship of the proletariat; serious crises arose in party life and state leadership. All of these provided favorable conditions for the counterrevolutionaries to launch a counterrevolutionary uprising.

The unprecedented betrayal of Nagy Imre and his group played a serious role. From engaging in factional activities within the party, they gradually degenerated into secret or open alliances with the bourgeoisie and imperialism, abandoned the rule of the working class, betrayed the class, invited imperialist intervention, and betrayed the country. They turned some party organizations, the Petőfi Club, and the Writers' Association at that time into legal organizations of the counterrevolution. They helped the counterrevolutionary forces, convened meetings with ulterior motives, organized demonstrations. They disrupted and paralyzed the forces of the socialist revolution and the people's state, paving the way for the counterrevolution to seize power.

The main forces of the domestic counterrevolution were the former large landowners, the bourgeoisie, and their reactionary lackeys, who had been deprived of political rights, privileges, and economic bases in the early days, and were trying to restore capitalism and the fascist system. These former exploiting class elements, who, after losing power, had not completely eliminated their influence in thought and politics, quickly reorganized and mobilized their forces with the support of international imperialism in their restoration plans. In just a few days, they organized forty so-called national parties. Among these parties, there were three parties that had participated in the coalition government in the past and were reorganized on a counterrevolutionary basis, and there was also an openly fascist party, the Arrow Cross Party, which had already begun to operate in two states. In addition to the parties of the former ruling class, they also used the so-called "workers' councils" and "revolutionary" councils with counterrevolutionary programs to achieve their political goals.

When talking about the causes of the 1956 counterrevolutionary uprising, Kádár emphasized that international imperialism, led by the U.S. reactionary clique, was the most favorable factor for the outbreak of the counterrevolutionary uprising in Hungary. From the day Hungary was liberated, they used all the means at their disposal to support various enemies of the Hungarian people. For many years, imperialism had instigated, incited, and organized counterrevolutionary uprisings, and finally, through their agents and political allies, Nagy Imre and his group and the domestic bourgeoisie counterrevolutionary forces, launched the counterrevolutionary uprising. Thus, the domestic counterrevolutionary forces and the international imperialist forces formed an alliance against the Hungarian People's Republic.

Kádár said, our Party Central Committee, in the December 1956 resolution, for the first time made a comprehensive and systematic Marxist analysis of the October 1956 counterrevolutionary uprising and took a Marxist stance. On this point, we can present three important facts to the congress:

First, we believe that the events that took place in the first few days of November 1956 and thereafter were counterrevolutionary in nature, and the correctness of this judgment has been proven by facts. Subsequent discoveries have further confirmed this.

Second, all the laboring people of Hungary have accepted and agreed with our party's analysis of the causes and driving forces of the counterrevolutionary uprising.

Third, the international communist movement and progressive people around the world have accepted and supported our evaluation.

In the counterrevolutionary uprising, all domestic enemies of our party and the people's republic united. The counterrevolutionary forces, while talking about socialism, democracy, freedom, and revolution, attacked the institutions of the Hungarian People's Republic with arms and massacred thousands of communists and progressives loyal to the people's republic. Our party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, fulfilled its duties in serious circumstances. The Hungarian communists, with a sense of responsibility for the fate of the people, established a new revolutionary center, organized the new leadership of the struggle, the new Central Committee, formed the revolutionary government of workers and peasants, and requested the help of our loyal and best friend and ally, the Soviet Union.

Kádár said, the historical problem posed to us at that time was serious and complex. The enemies attacking us were mortal enemies, and on their side were also those who were deceived and led astray. In such a situation, only a firm, principled policy and decisive action could solve the problem.

One issue was whether to allow the continued silence about Nagy Imre and others having betrayed to the enemy's camp. The answer was only one: to completely break with the traitors; to clarify the situation to the masses; to expose and eliminate the traitors.

One issue was whether to allow compromise with the armed attackers and investigate who was from what social background. The answer could only be: those who attack the people's republic and its institutions with arms should be met with weapons.

One issue was who to suppress and purify, and who to give freedom and democracy. The answer could only be: to give freedom and democracy to the warriors of the socialist revolution and the laboring people, and to suppress and purify the counterrevolutionaries, the bourgeois elements attempting to restore the old order, and their various lackeys.

It is clear that only those who are loyal to the people's republic, have a true patriotic spirit, and have proletarian internationalist ideas can clearly and openly fight against the incitement of nationalism and national hatred.

To oppose the "neutrality" of the counterrevolutionaries, whose purpose is to isolate our country and pull it into the embrace of imperialism, we must unambiguously declare: we will always be loyal to the Warsaw Pact when it is needed, and we will always march forward with the socialist camp.

On the issue of what basis our political system will be established, we must also give a clear answer. Our answer is: the political system of a socialist state cannot be based on workers' councils and "revolutionary" councils led by the counterrevolution. We have established our political system on the basis of the Marxist-Leninist party leading the workers' and peasants' alliance, trade unions, the Patriotic People's Front, and other mass organizations, and have abandoned the workers' councils system; we have established local power on the basis of the proven local organizations of the people's power, the local councils, instead of the various counterrevolutionary councils.

The question of whether our country will implement a one-party system or a multi-party system was also raised. For the people's democratic system as a form of proletarian dictatorship, the leading role of the working-class party is a principle issue, a universal law. The one-party system or multi-party system is not a principle of universal law, but a practical political issue determined by the specific political and social situation of a country. During the counterrevolutionary uprising, it was proven that in our specific situation, the multi-party system was favorable to the counterrevolution, so we abandoned the multi-party system.

We have developed the Patriotic People's Front led by the party, replacing the multi-party system. The Patriotic People's Front led by the party is suitable and can politically unite communist party members and all non-party social figures who agree on the basic goals of building socialism, defending national sovereignty and independence, and strengthening the people's republic. The new and active experience of the past three years has proven that the Patriotic People's Front led by the party is a political movement that can engage in constructive work, which, in addition to communists, can also unite social figures who were originally members of a party or have always been non-partisan.

The question of whether to punish or pardon those who made mistakes during the counterrevolutionary uprising was a long-debated issue. Our party's stance was, is, and will be: to punish the instigators, leaders, organizers, and murderers of the counterrevolutionary uprising for the sake of the vital interests of the people. However, those who have not committed serious crimes, have been deceived, or have been misled should be pardoned. The judicial organs of the Hungarian People's Republic have done just that, and we can say that this policy of punishment has been supported and approved by the people's sense of justice.

Economic issues also posed many serious problems. Our party's response to these problems was: to oppose incitement, to stop the phenomenon of getting money without work, to organize production, and to establish labor and wage discipline.

To give a correct and appropriate solution to these serious problems, especially to solve them appropriately, requires the party to, on the one hand, resolutely draw a clear line with those who compromise with the enemy and the traitors, and on the other hand, to get rid of those who do not believe in the masses and dare not rely on the masses with sectarian views.

In serious situations, the party must simultaneously solve two very important tasks: one is to get rid of past mistakes; the other is to suppress the counterrevolutionary uprising. The party has the ability to complete and has already completed these two tasks. A bold, open, and firm Marxist-Leninist stance and policy have brought results. The party will long pay attention to the entire experience and lessons of the counterrevolutionary uprising. However, as far as the counterrevolutionary uprising itself is concerned, it has completely failed in all aspects and has become a historical relic. Stability, consolidation, and rapid development are the characteristics of the current domestic political situation in the Hungarian People's Republic. The people's power is stronger than before the counterrevolutionary uprising, the socialist foundation has been greatly expanded, and socialist construction is proceeding smoothly and vigorously. Without the political support and hard work of the masses, this situation would not have formed.

Kádár detailed the reasons why the Soviet army is stationed in Hungary, which is not due to domestic politics but depends on those international issues that have not yet been resolved. We, together with the Soviet government, the governments of the countries participating in the Warsaw Pact, and the governments of all socialist countries, unanimously advocate negotiations on the issue of the simultaneous withdrawal of troops stationed abroad.

We have repeatedly clearly stated that the Soviet army will remain in Hungary until the international situation no longer requires it. Some people think that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary will bring about what consequences, and on this point, we believe: it will not be beneficial to the reactionaries either. The forces of the Hungarian socialist revolution and the supporters of the socialist revolution have learned what is needed, and they can defend our system from the invasion of domestic enemies. If the reactionaries want to challenge us again, we do not object, because the Hungarian people have the strength to deal with the counterrevolutionaries, and there are enough places to settle accounts with them.

After analyzing the 1956 counterrevolutionary uprising incident, Kádár said, we learn from experience, do not repeat mistakes, and will not forget the traitors, class enemies, and imperialists. On the basis of past experience, we will further strengthen our people's state and our country's system. We will continue to strengthen the workers' and peasants' alliance and implement the principle of democratic centralism in state life. While strengthening the centralized leadership of the state, we will continue to expand the powers of local government agencies.

In the third part of his report, Kádár talked about the economic situation and the tasks facing economic construction in Hungary.

Kádár said, our country's economic situation can be described as good. Since liberation, we have achieved great successes in economic construction. Since 1949, our people have built 100 large-scale industrial enterprises, and new-type socialist industrial cities have been born in Hungary. Agriculture has also shown some degree of development, with the number of tractors in the country increasing from 7,000 in 1935 to 31,000 in 1959. The amount of fertilizer used per hectare in 1938 was only 13.5 kilograms, but by 1959, it had increased to 77 kilograms. The standard of living has improved significantly in the past decade, and the great achievements in economic life since liberation have specifically proven the great superiority of the socialist system over capitalism.

Kádár said, three years ago, economic life once came to a standstill. Production stopped, and the so-called workers' councils and "revolutionary" councils organized production, plundered the national economy, and dismantled the economic leadership organizations, threatening the state and the laboring people with inflation and economic crisis. The Central Committee and the government, while fighting the counterrevolutionary thugs with arms, vigorously addressed the issue of restoring the national economy. We turned to the miners, workers, and peasants, and also sought economic assistance from the leaders and peoples of the brotherly socialist countries.

First of all, it was the Soviet Union, and at the same time, China and other people's democracies also provided us with assistance without exception. In addition to rapid and interest-free aid, the Soviet Union and other people's democracies supported us with 1.2 billion rubles in material and free foreign exchange as long-term loans. We deeply appreciate the assistance of the leaders and peoples of the brotherly countries.

By the end of 1957, the national economy had been restored. Socialist industry was restored, and both industry and agriculture were producing. The mandatory procurement system was replaced by a purchase system at appropriate prices, improving the living standards of urban and rural laborers.

After restoring the national economy and normal economic working conditions, we formulated the guidelines for economic work and formulated the three-year national economic plan on this basis.

The output of state-owned industry increased by 14% compared to 1955. Labor productivity increased by 8% compared to 1955. The total investment in 1958 increased by 23 billion compared to 1955.

Due to the excellent results of 1958, 1959 had better conditions to start construction. In addition to the excellent results in economic life, the great victory of the election, the great progress in the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the inspiring 21st Congress of the CPSU all helped to increase the confidence, labor enthusiasm, and passion of the laboring people. All of these were the basis for the Central Committee to call on the people of the country in the March 1959 resolution to consolidate the large number of newly developed and greatly expanded cooperatives and to launch a greater socialist construction campaign.

Title: The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee Report
Author:
Date: 1959-03-01
Page: 1

The March resolution of the Central Committee has sparked a favorable and enthusiastic response among the working masses. Under the joint initiative of the Budapest Party Committee, the National Council of Trade Unions, the Csepel Ironworks, and many other large factories, a labor competition movement has been widely launched to welcome the Party Congress. Our working people have completed 97% of the tribute by early November.

In the first three quarters of this year, we are completing the tasks set for strengthening production cooperatives in agriculture. Compared to the same period last year, industrial production has increased by 12%, and labor productivity has increased by 4%.

The overall results of the first three quarters show that we can achieve the targets set by the March resolution in industrial production and production costs, and possibly in labor productivity as well. This means we can achieve the levels set for the end of 1960 in several key indicators a year ahead of schedule.

Kádár then spoke about the continuous improvement in the living standards of the Hungarian working people. He said: From 1949 to the end of 1958, the real income of workers increased by 56%, and that of peasants by 26%. In 1958, the total wage fund for workers in our country reached 419 billion forints, and the total amount of bonuses outside wages reached 116 billion forints.

The good achievements of 1958 enabled the Central Committee to address several urgent issues related to living standards. Recently, the Politburo reviewed the implementation of the Central Committee's resolution on the situation of the working class. Now I can announce on behalf of the Central Committee to the Congress that all points related to living standards in this resolution have been realized.

Kádár then discussed the tasks facing Hungary in economic construction. He said that economic construction and productive labor serve our social purposes. In the next few years, our people need to complete the task of laying the foundations of socialism and accelerate the building of a socialist society.

On the economic and production fronts, our immediate task is to fulfill and overfulfill the plans for this year and next year, thereby creating a higher and more reliable starting point for the new five-year plan. We need to formulate a good new five-year plan and mobilize the masses to implement this plan.

The plan should ensure that industrial production by the end of 1965 is at least 65%–70% higher than the 1958 level, while agricultural production should increase by 30%–32%. National income should increase by at least 50%. In the growth of industrial production, the primary goal is to increase productivity by 37%–40%.

We must further develop industry. We must ensure the faster development of heavy industry while also significantly developing light industry. We must ensure that productivity in the entire national economy, primarily through technological improvements, is increased, striving for economic production and reducing production costs. In the next few years, we must bring the entire national economy of our country closer to the economic level of the most developed countries. From the perspective of development, the decisive issue today is to eliminate the relative backwardness of agricultural production within the entire national economy.

There are still some issues that we need to face and resolve to ensure the faster development of the national economy. In terms of increasing productivity, due to the shocks and setbacks of the past six years, we have fallen behind the development speed of all socialist countries. The main condition for overcoming the relative backwardness in increasing productivity is to significantly improve the technological level.

Kádár said that economic leaders should learn to rely more on the greatest driving force of our country's development—the initiative, opinions, and enthusiasm of the masses—in their work. The significant experiences gained this year in the socialist labor competition and the struggle for the title of socialist labor should be noted and utilized. Economic leaders should learn to better utilize the possibilities of economic cooperation among socialist countries for the benefit of our national economy. We should strive within the framework of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance to achieve broader economic specialization and cooperation.

Kádár said that the instructions of the Congress point out that in the new five-year plan, while ensuring an appropriate increase in the quantity of means of production and their quality development, the real income of each worker should increase by at least 26%–29%, and the residents' consumption fund by the end of 1965 should be at least 40%–45% higher than now.

The indicators related to housing construction in the new five-year plan play an active role in improving the living conditions of residents. The Central Committee has proposed that the drafting of a fifteen-year plan for housing construction should be the top priority over other tasks. During the three five-year plans, a total of one million modern, hygienically sound new-style houses need to be built. This means that in fifteen years, 40% of residents will move into new homes. In other words, the implementation of the fifteen-year housing construction plan will meet the needs of all families requiring separate housing.

Kádár then discussed cultural and educational issues in the fourth part of his report.

Kádár said that our party attaches due importance to the tasks that need to be addressed in the current development of culture. This is a fundamental issue of social development, and it is also an issue of making the lives of the working people better.

Since liberation, there has been a significant quantitative development in the cultural level of the Hungarian working people and in general cultural development, which is also a qualitative change. This improvement brings people closer to the level of a socially conscious, all-round developed, and cultured person in future society—closer to the victory of the socialist cultural revolution.

After describing the great achievements in education, science, scientific education and research, literature, and art in Hungary over the past fifteen years since liberation, Kádár said that although the progress and victory of the socialist revolution on the cultural front have achieved great results, they are still relatively lagging behind the achievements in the political and economic fields. To overcome capitalism in people's consciousness in the cultural field will require a longer time.

He said that currently, the influence of the counter-revolutionary uprising and the incitement of revisionism in the ideological sphere is still felt. At the same time, this also has its positive side: the struggle against the counter-revolution on this front has strengthened the Marxist core among intellectuals, strengthened our scientific and artistic endeavors, and this is also a great school for educating the masses. The party's guidelines on educational policy, documents on literary issues, populist writers, and national issues are our new and powerful weapons for struggle.

Kádár pointed out that we absolutely demand that science and art better serve the working class, the laboring masses, and socialist construction, and serve their needs. Science and art should help develop new, socialist attitudes towards labor and social obligations, strengthen socialist patriotism and internationalism, and spread scientific worldviews.

It is necessary to overcome the remnants of capitalist ideology—nationalism, revisionism, anti-Semitism. It is necessary to resolutely and thoroughly combat small-bourgeois ideology, the self-centered, selfish ideas of small proprietors.

To achieve this goal, Marxist-Leninist ideology must become the dominant worldview in the realm of ideology, science, and culture.

Kádár then pointed out that our educational system must be reformed. In terms of worldview content in education, we must resolutely transform our schools into socialist schools. Schools should be closer to life.

In the new five-year plan, we will ensure the necessary conditions for the development of science. The state's demands on science, scientists, and researchers have increased, requiring them to adjust their research programs on basic and applied sciences to better meet the needs of our society and the problems to be solved in economic and cultural development. Technical sciences and agricultural sciences play a huge role in the technical development of our national economy and the promotion of large-scale agricultural production.

Kádár said that the party's policies and the influence of real life have promoted the progress of the thoughts of writers and artists. Even among the writer groups that were anti-party during the counter-revolutionary events, this influence is significant. However, there are still some people who lag behind the progressive situation. These people should face the main issues and examine whether they stand with the people building socialism or are detached from them. The people expect every writer and artist to clearly express their stance on the following issues in their works: in the class struggle, whose side are they on, and with whom do they stand? Kádár pointed out that artists, writers, journalists, and cultural workers should strive more purposefully to occupy the positions of socialist ideology and progressive culture. They should more effectively combat the remnants of reactionary bourgeois ideology, small-bourgeois, shoddy products, ignorance, and the harmful influences of unscientific worldviews.

In the fifth part of his report, Kádár discussed issues related to the socialist transformation of agriculture.

He said that from the perspective of continuing the development of our socialist social system, completing the socialist transformation of agriculture in the next few years and thereby laying the foundations of a socialist society in our country is a decisive task.

He pointed out that completing the socialist transformation of agriculture has great political significance because the emergence of new socialist peasants will resolve existing contradictions, and our most important political foundation—the worker-peasant alliance—will thereby become unbreakable. Our worker-peasant state—the Hungarian People's Republic—will also become invincible.

He then pointed out that from the perspective of the national economy, we must also complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. Currently, the backward production relations on small plots of land are the main obstacle to significantly improving the level of agricultural production, and they also hinder the rapid development of the entire national economy and the further significant improvement of people's living standards.

Only in socialist large-scale operations can modern agriculture be realized with more machinery, better irrigation, more fertilizers and chemical fertilizers, and better seeds. This year's agricultural production results also illustrate the difference between large-scale and small-scale operations. This year, the average yield per hectare of winter wheat was 13.4 hundredweight in state farms, 11 hundredweight in production cooperatives, and 8.6 hundredweight for individual farmers; the average yield per hectare of winter barley was 15 hundredweight in state farms, 13.5 hundredweight in production cooperatives, and 11.8 hundredweight for individual farmers; the average yield per hectare of corn was 17.5 hundredweight in state farms, 16 hundredweight in production cooperatives, and 14.4 hundredweight for individual farmers. The above production results of individual farming peasants were only achieved after hard and arduous labor.

Therefore, Kádár said, the party and the working class must, through propaganda and education, on the basis of ensuring the principle of voluntarism, guide individual farming peasants onto the path of socialist agriculture and help them in organizational work and material consolidation. We should patiently and persuasively explain to individual farming peasants that once they free themselves from the shackles of the old peasant way of life, no longer being slaves to money or land, socialism will open up a beautiful new life for them!

Kádár, when discussing the issue of the worker-peasant alliance, said that the working class is the leading class of our society, the ruling "governing" class. In the past and now, they have sacrificed personal interests to aid their brother class—the peasants—and have built an increasingly powerful socialist industry in our country. The working class is now leading its ally in the struggle to build a new socialist society. In the future, the party's task will still be to help the broad masses of the working class improve their consciousness, political cultivation, professional knowledge, and cultural level. Peasants, as allies of the leading class of workers, have made contributions in their own way in the struggle against the Horthyites, domestic fascists, the bourgeoisie, and landlords, to win people's power. During the period of the counter-revolutionary attack by the bourgeoisie and fascist forces in 1956, peasants proved to be loyal allies of the working class, participating in the struggle to defend socialist achievements and secure the situation. Today, the basic content of worker-peasant unity is to jointly defend and strengthen people's power and form an alliance to build a socialist society. The current task is: the most conscious peasants working in state farms, production cooperatives, and machine stations in the countryside should help backward elements overcome the remaining selfish ideas and build a socialist Hungarian countryside.

Kádár then discussed the issue of intellectuals. He said that intellectuals, in terms of their role, are one of the main strata of our society. The development of socialist construction has increased the social role and creative possibilities of intellectuals. The party and the government trust and respect intellectuals and strive to further improve their material conditions. Local party organizations should overcome the phenomenon of closing doors to intellectuals and mistrust in some places.

Kádár then discussed the party's policy towards transforming petty bourgeois elements, craftsmen, and small traders. He said that the party seeks to transform petty bourgeois elements ideologically and politically through persuasion and guide them onto the path of socialism in a way they can accept, ensuring their personal happiness and the future of their children.

Kádár discussed the party's policy towards the exploiting class. He said that some former exploiters and their supporters have adapted to our society. Another part, however, opposed people's power in 1956 and still hold hostile attitudes today. Those among them who have opposed our system will be treated as enemies. We will continue to be vigilant against former exploiters undermining our system and the interests of our people. Those among them who oppose our system will have to consider the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat. At the same time, the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and our achievements in socialist construction have increased the possibility of transforming former exploiters.

He said that the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion does not mean the end of class struggle in our country. A classless society is born in the midst of class struggle; this is a law of social development. We should remember that our goal—to complete the foundational work of socialism and build a socialist society—will be achieved through class struggle. From the perspective of socialism and the interests of our people, it is not necessary to sharpen class struggle, but rather, if its intensity is reduced and its forms are less sharp, it would be a good thing. The party and people's power do not seek to sharpen class struggle. This does not depend on us first, but on our class enemies and international imperialism.

He said that class struggle will continue. Former members of the exploiting class, as long as they do not violate the law, respect and adapt to our social system in an orderly manner, will be treated as citizens with equal rights by the laws of our people's state. Our policy towards the kulaks also illustrates this. We have pointed out in the law that former kulaks can abandon their past, and after two years of honest labor, they can become formal members of production cooperatives and be elected as leaders of the cooperatives. For the children of former exploiters, our party strives to help them find their place in the new socialist world, putting down the burden of the past.

Kádár discussed the so-called émigré issue. He said that we can divide the émigrés into two parts: a small part are stubborn fascists and criminals, and we have no pity for them. The majority of émigrés are people who have lost their way under the influence of reactionary and imperialist propaganda, and we will help them return to their homeland and live in our society again. Among the émigrés, many were agents of imperialists at home or became loyal political servants of imperialists after being bought by them abroad. They will one day stand before the Hungarian working people to be judged.

In the sixth part of his report, Kádár discussed several issues related to the party, the leadership of the party, and the relationship between the party and the masses.

Kádár said that the basic teachings of Marxism-Leninism teach us that without the party and the leadership of the party, the working class cannot seize and hold power; without the leadership of the party, a socialist society cannot be built.

Revisionists attempt to weaken the great significance of the party's leadership role in the daily life of socialist countries. The experience of Hungary clearly and convincingly shows that after seizing power, the significance of the party and its leadership role has not diminished but has increased.

Everyone knows that in the days when the counter-revolutionary rebellion was rampant, the much larger socialist forces were unable to effectively counter the representative minority of counter-revolutionary forces for a period. The decisive cause of this situation was that the various errors produced earlier and the internal betrayals that became apparent during the counter-revolutionary period prevented the party from playing the leadership role it should have.

At that time, rebuilding the party and reorganizing the leadership of the working class was the primary and necessary condition for the revolutionary forces to launch a powerful counterattack. In the struggle against the counter-revolution, we rebuilt the party, and by May 1, 1957, this work was basically completed.

The guiding ideology of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is the scientific worldview of Marxism-Leninism; the theoretical foundation and communist policies of the party are not new. What is new is that the Central Committee, after a series of deviations and errors, has guided the party back to the correct Leninist path, and in the methods and style of party work, new elements have been added that make us one with the broad masses today.

The past struggles and experiences are the source of the party's strength. The party today still draws strength from the glorious revolutionary experiences of the past forty years. However, during the period of rebuilding the party, the party, on the one hand, must inherit the fine revolutionary traditions; on the other hand, it must free itself from the personal cult and the shame of betrayal by revisionism that sullied the party's pure flag in recent years.

Today, our party, having learned from various experiences and tempered in struggle, is strong and united, playing the vanguard role, enjoying the trust of the people, and leading the surging socialist construction labor victoriously.

Kádár discussed the struggle against revisionism and dogmatism. He said that to defend the ideological foundation of party unity and the purity of Marxist-Leninist thought, the party has waged a two-front struggle in the past three years, against revisionism and dogmatism.

The party's internal dogmatic and revisionist tendencies will harm the working class's ideological weapons. Whether in Hungary or internationally, the main danger of these tendencies is revisionism. Modern revisionism revives the unvanquished old bourgeois ideology; it colludes with and relies on international imperialism and domestic reactionaries; particularly dangerous is that modern revisionism always appears before the masses in the guise of Marxism-Leninism.

The social base of revisionism is composed of the currently existing bourgeois and petty bourgeois elements. Revisionism distorts the basic principles of Marxism, denies the leadership role of the party, denies the role of the proletarian dictatorship state, and the significance of the socialist camp. Revisionism is closely linked to bourgeois nationalism and will inevitably lead to the betrayal of the interests of the working class in politics.

Revisionism is an international phenomenon aimed at undermining the position of the Communist Party within the working class of various countries. Revisionism is essentially the "Marxism" fabricated by the bourgeoisie. Although it takes the most modern form, just as all attacks on Marxism over the past hundred years have failed, it is also doomed to failure. In this regard, the entire disreputable history of the revisionist group in our country is a clear example. This group, from fabricating Marxist-Leninist doctrine, developed to creating party splits, and ultimately betraying the country, has traveled the entire path that revisionism must inevitably take.

Today, there are no revisionist views in the Central Committee and the basic party membership. The shadow cast by revisionist elements on the party is not the disgrace of the party and the masses who support the party, but the disgrace of these traitors.

Kádár said that dogmatism, in essence, is also a distortion and inversion of Marxism-Leninism. Although dogmatism does not come from the bourgeoisie but is produced in the soil of the workers' movement itself, it can also cause great harm to the party, the working class, and the cause of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In recent years, the personal cult around Rákosi Mátyás and the dogmatic and sectarian policies adopted due to the personal cult have caused serious damage to the party. However, this issue also has its confusing side, and a conclusion should be drawn on this point. Rákosi Mátyás fought for the Soviet Republic in 1919, played an outstanding role in the anti-Horthy fascist struggle, and played a leading role in the political struggle after liberation. However, after the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, he initially tolerated the personal cult, and later encouraged it himself, thereby causing serious damage to the socialist cause. From an essential point of view, those who initially supported Rákosi's beneficial actions in the early years did the right thing, and when they saw Rákosi's serious errors and his stubbornness, they withdrew their trust in the leader and criticized him, which was also the right thing to do. Hungarian communists, the Hungarian party, and the masses who initially followed Rákosi do not need to feel ashamed of the personal cult, the serious damage it caused, and the shadow it cast on the party; those who should feel ashamed are those who caused these errors, Rákosi himself and the group that supported his errors.

Kádár then discussed the party's educational situation. He said that we have also achieved results in party education. The Marxist cultivation and cultural level of propagandists have greatly improved. The current situation requires us to strengthen the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism, primarily to improve the Marxist-Leninist level of party members.

Kádár discussed the organizational situation of the party. He said that we have 16,805 basic party organizations, 402,456 party members, and 35,500 candidate members. 60% of party members and 56% of candidate members, according to their original occupations, are workers. 14% of party members and 19% of candidate members are working peasants.

Based on our experience, the number of party members is also of principle significance to whether the party can maintain its vanguard nature. The Central Committee believes that our party's organizational scope was too broad in the past, affecting the vanguard nature of the party. In the process of rebuilding the party, the Central Committee, considering this experience, has sought to appropriately control the scope of the party's organization. Today, although the number of our party members is only half of what it was before, we still have the right to say that the party is stronger than before the counter-revolutionary events. Today's party is truly a voluntary fighting alliance of people with consistent ideological principles, and the work style of the party has developed greatly in the past three years. The characteristics of this communist work style are firmness in principles, trust in the masses, frankness, enthusiasm, and practicality. To continue the development of party life and party work, we must overcome the remaining erroneous views, improve our theoretical, political, and professional levels. All levels of party organizations must engage more deeply in economic work and cultural construction; must continue to improve cadre work; must more resolutely implement party resolutions and improve the inspection of the implementation of resolutions.

Kádár then discussed the relationship between the party and the masses. He said that the thousands of ties connecting the party and the Hungarian people are established and strengthened through various mass organizations, mass movements, and direct contacts with the masses. Without the mutual trust and close connection between the party and the people, the party cannot live or work.

He discussed the work of trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation, and their importance. He said that today, mass organizations and mass movements are working independently under the ideological and political leadership of the party, playing their respective roles based on their different natures, and basically well serving as bridges between the party and the masses.

Kádár then discussed the direct connection between the party and the masses. The forms of this connection are varied, such as newspapers, radio stations, holding meetings, organizing open party activities, the daily work of neighborhood party cells, the propaganda work that all communists should always do, personal contacts between communists and non-party masses, etc. The party frankly, directly, and openly tells the broad non-party masses about achievements and difficulties. In the past three years, it is this frankness and sincerity that has created a great moral capital of mutual trust between the party and the non-party masses. Continuing to strengthen this mutual trust is the key to the party's future success. He said that we must oppose bureaucracy and indifference to people and things, and must handle people's various matters, opinions, and demands with the most serious attitude. Party organizations should take these issues seriously and provide various guidances. Related issues should be conveyed to relevant organizations, and their handling should be followed up.

Kádár then discussed the international connections of the party. He said that our party is a patriotic and internationalist party. Our socialist revolution can only develop by closely uniting with the international communist movement.

As we can hope, our relations with the brother parties, the Communist and Workers' Parties, and the most experienced and powerful among them—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—are the deepest and best.

We believe that learning from our people and learning from the experiences of the international communist movement is our task. The Central Committee believes that in the past three years of struggle, while paying attention to our specific conditions and national characteristics, we have correctly understood and applied the international experience of class struggle and the main international laws of socialist construction.

Kádár said that when discussing the international connections of the party, I must point out that our relations with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have deteriorated, and now there is no official contact between our two parties. The fundamental reason for this situation is that the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has revised Marxism. Their theoretical points and practical measures proposed are harmful to the international communist movement and harmful to our party.

We have had disagreements. In December 1956, they openly suggested to us not to rebuild the party because such an attempt would be "in vain"; they suggested that we establish our political system on the so-called workers' councils, replacing the party. We have debated their programmatic points—including those on the theory of the state and the overall evaluation of the socialist camp—which are anti-Marxist. We believe that accepting their points would mean disarming the working class in the struggle against the bourgeoisie and international imperialism.

Everyone knows that after the autumn of 1949, there was a period when some mistakes were made in Hungary that harmed the relations between the two parties, and even between the two countries. However, it is also a fact that since the summer of 1953, Hungary has been continuously striving to improve this relationship. From that time on, there has never been an attempt by the Hungarian side to interfere in the internal affairs of the Yugoslav party. On the other hand, the situation is the opposite: during the period of 1956-1957, there were a series of interventions and attempts at intervention in the internal affairs of our party and our country.

Kádár said that the political and ideological foundation of the activities of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is built on the doctrines of the classics of Marxism-Leninism, the resolutions of the party's successive congresses that summarize our experiences, the resolutions of the 20th and 21st Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the 1957 November Declaration in Moscow, which summarized the most important experiences of the international communist movement. We take the main laws of socialist construction that apply to all countries as the basis, and while considering our national characteristics and domestic conditions, we strive to realize these laws in life. We believe that our party is a Marxist-Leninist party, and one of the main principles of a Marxist-Leninist party is proletarian internationalism. Therefore, our party was, is, and will be an internationalist party.

Kádár finally pointed out that the current tasks of the party, in summary, are to complete the foundational work of a socialist society in the next few years. With the better and faster resolution of economic and cultural construction tasks, the day when the socialist revolution in our country achieves a thorough and final victory will come sooner.

The conditions for completing the above tasks are: within the party, to defend the purity of our ideological foundation—Marxism-Leninism; to creatively apply scientific theory and implement clear and firm communist policies.

We must be thorough and uncompromising in implementing policies. In the future, the main firepower of ideological struggle should be directed against the remnants of hostile bourgeois views and revisionist views. At the same time, we will not make concessions to dogmatism and sectarian activities.

It is clear that this Congress will draw conclusions on many past issues. We will not forget the experiences, but those issues that have already passed should also be put into history. We should look forward, see the tasks of tomorrow, and concentrate our efforts to solve these tasks.

Today, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian People's Republic are strong, and the international conditions are good. Our party, all levels of party organizations, and every party member should work with greater enthusiasm than before.

The party should rely more on the masses, and the masses should unite more closely around the party. The Hungarian people must form a closer friendship with the people of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp, and must unite more closely with the increasingly powerful international socialist and peaceful forces. We are confident that the thorough victory of socialism in our country is also imminent; the most beautiful and true ideal of the Hungarian people for generations—socialist Hungary—will be established.

    匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员、中央委员会第一书记卡达尔·亚诺什
    向匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会作的报告（摘要）
    本报讯　匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员、中央委员会第一书记卡达尔·亚诺什，代表中央委员会向党的第七次代表大会作了报告。他在报告中首先指出，在为了准备这次代表大会而召开的改选领导机构的党员大会和党代表会议上，大家完全赞同中央关于代表大会的指示。党员一致坚决执行这一政策。因此，可以这样说，今天中央委员会和全体党员是团结一致的，我们党的这种团结是强大的、牢不可破的。
    他说：在为迎接这次代表大会而掀起的社会主义劳动竞赛中，除了竞赛的倡议者共产党人以外，还有几十万非党人士、工人、农民、知识分子参加，他们以劳动创造的行动，对实现我们党代表大会的目标，作出了贡献，这一事实具有重大的政治意义。它本身就光辉地证明了，今天在我国党和群众有密切的联系，党和人民在社会主义旗帜下团结一致的伟大力量。
    他提出这次代表大会的任务是：总结党的斗争经验和提出未来的任务。中央委员会在工作中虽然还有缺点，但是可以毫无愧色地向代表大会报告工作，因为它所执行的政策已经被证明是正确的。只要把匈牙利人民共和国三年前的严重形势同今天巩固的形势比较一下，我们就可以大胆地把这一总的成就，认为是党、工人阶级、匈牙利人民和社会主义革命的历史性的胜利。
    他并且向各国共产党和工人党、社会主义各国人民、全世界觉悟的工人和进步人士给予匈牙利的援助表示了深切的感谢。
    （一）
    卡达尔在报告的第一部分中，说明了匈牙利的外交政策和国际形势。
    他说，我国外交政策的目标，是保卫我国人民取得的巨大成果，保证社会主义的和平建设。我国外交政策的基本原则是：匈苏友好，忠实于社会主义阵营，反对帝国主义，不顾社会制度的差异同一切国家和人民和平共处。
    卡达尔说，匈牙利人民能够把苏联——正在进行七年计划和共产主义建设的国家、人类进步和世界和平最强大的力量——当作自己的朋友而感到骄傲。近几年来，苏联取得的成就中有布拉茨克水电站、原子能发电站、列宁号原子破冰船等，并且在两年中就发射了三颗人造卫星，三颗宇宙火箭，其中一颗已把苏联的国徽送到月球上，另一颗则以苏联的技术把人类从来没有看见过的月球背面摄影下来了。在和平竞赛中苏联决定性的优势在于它有比资本主义更优越的社会主义社会，社会主义社会提供了无止境的发展的可能性。苏联已经提出了这样的目标：到1970年在按人口平均计算的生产量和消费量方面，赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家——美国。今天，世界上任何严肃的政治因素，都不能怀疑这个目标会得到实现。匈牙利劳动人民衷心地预祝苏联人民，在和平竞赛中尽早取得完全的胜利。
    他追述了匈苏两国具有悠久传统的友谊，特别是苏联从匈牙利领土上击退了纳粹法西斯军队，苏联的儿女不顾牺牲自己的生命，从侵略者的枷锁下解放了匈牙利人民。并且表示匈牙利人民永远怀着感激的心情来追念1956年苏联应工农革命政府的请求，对于受到反革命和帝国主义威胁的匈牙利人民所给予的援助。只有依靠这一援助，才有可能阻止资本主义、法西斯主义重新骑在匈牙利人民的头上和把我国变成帝国主义的军事走廊和战场。
    他说，在过去十五年中，苏联两次以它儿女的鲜血证明了它对匈牙利人民的深厚友谊和国际主义精神。在这十五年中，它还通过各种方式，帮助匈牙利人民恢复战争创伤，建设社会主义。匈牙利人民和苏联人民的敌人，几年以前还污蔑苏联“剥削”我国。这种诽谤的愚蠢性已经如此明显，今天连敌人自己也承认，苏匈经济关系对于匈牙利更为有利。
    卡达尔以匈苏之间的经济关系，同资本主义大国同小国的贸易关系作了尖锐的对比。他说：苏联同匈牙利和其他社会主义国家的经济关系，不是从商业利润的原则出发的，而是一个存在更久的、力量更强大的社会主义国家无私地、不惜牺牲地提供兄弟援助的关系。在1958年的贸易额中，苏联供给匈牙利的货物，82％是原料和半制成品。苏联供给匈牙利的铁矿砂、石油、木材等原料占匈牙利国民经济所需进口原料的绝大部分。而匈牙利在1958年供给苏联的商品，58％都是机器工业产品和精密机械产品。一个社会主义大国——苏联——同一个较小的社会主义国家——匈牙利——进行贸易的情况就是这样。
    从来都没有过这样一个资本主义大国，在同一个小国发展贸易时，以优惠条件主要输出原料，而输入的大部分都是工业制成品。这种作法同资本主义的实质背道而驰，资本主义的实质在于，除剥削本国人民外，还剥削其他国家人民。他们把前者称为“创业和从业的自由”，把后者称为“贸易自由”，两者合在一起，就成为“自由世界”。
    他强调说，今天，匈苏友谊是强大的。这一友谊是匈牙利人民力量的泉源、伟大的支柱和繁荣的保证。不断加强匈苏友谊，维护这一永恒的、牢不可破的友谊，是我们党和政府对外政策最主要的任务。
    他并且指出匈牙利同社会主义阵营各国——苏联、中华人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、越南民主共和国——之间存在着良好的友谊，在紧密的团结中共同前进。
    卡达尔说，我们高兴地看到，社会主义阵营各国正在生气蓬勃地进行劳动，不断取得新的、伟大的胜利，在社会主义的道路上向前迈进。十年前，中国反帝人民解放战争取得了胜利，并继而进行了社会主义革命，这一事实本身大大改变了世界的政治面貌。一个拥有六亿五千万人口的国家，从国际帝国主义剥削的地区，从封建的、半殖民地的国家，变成为社会主义的世界大国。它的榜样、它空前的迅速发展，是令人振奋和鼓舞的。中国的榜样，同时证明了社会主义制度的优越性和摆脱了压迫者而获得解放的人民所具有的无限的创造力。中国克服了闻所未闻的困难，使去年粮食的生产为1949年的两倍半，煤炭为九倍，石油为十九倍，生铁为四十倍。
    他说，社会主义阵营团结巩固的、牢不可破的基础，是共同的社会政治制度、社会主义建设的共同道路、共同的世界观以及保卫和平的共同努力。指导社会主义阵营内部的合作的原则，不仅是平等、领土完整、尊重国家的独立和主权、互不干涉内政，而且是更进一步的相互帮助。赫鲁晓夫在柏林的讲话中，精辟地表述了这一点，他说，在我们的阵营里，占统治地位的原则是“我为人人，人人为我”的原则。以苏联为核心和领导力量的社会主义阵营，今天是世界进步和和平的主要力量。匈牙利人民共和国是社会主义阵营平等的、受尊重的一员。为了忠实地服务于我国人民的切身利益，我国外交政策的基础今后仍然应该是加强社会主义阵营的力量和团结，坚决地击退一切旨在损害这一力量和团结的企图。
    卡达尔表示了匈牙利同所有毗邻的国家和人民建立良好关系的愿望。他谈到1953年8月以来，匈牙利同南斯拉夫的国家关系逐步正常化了，这一关系在1956—58年间显著地恶化了，后来又有了一些缓慢的改善。他说，匈南两国之间建立正常的睦邻关系的可能性仍然是存在的。但是，由于南斯拉夫对我们的朋友——例如最近对中华人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国所进行的攻击，增加了困难。
    卡达尔在指出了奥地利政府允许敌视匈牙利人民共和国的西方集团的各种阴谋活动影响它的政策，一直容忍特务机关和匈牙利法西斯组织在它的领土上进行各种反对匈牙利人民共和国的破坏活动，严重地影响了两国关系，他表示，匈牙利人民共和国同奥地利、瑞典、瑞士等欧洲中立国家之间，没有任何真正的利害矛盾。我们争取同它们改善关系。
    谈到同亚非国家的关系时，卡达尔说最近十至十五年来，印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国等一系列国家的人民，摆脱了帝国主义的枷锁，走上了独立的民族发展的道路，全人类都认为，这是当代最重要的事件之一。我国同这些国家的关系是良好的，我们争取进一步改善这种关系。我们同他们站在一条战线上反对帝国主义；我们希望扩大同他们的经济、文化关系。匈牙利人民共和国对于这些从殖民地命运下解放出来的国家，发展自己独立的工业也能够作出一定的贡献。
    他说：我们完全同情那些正在为争取摆脱殖民地命运而进行斗争的各国人民。我们谴责对阿尔及利亚人民所进行的恐怖战争，并且支持他们为争取自决权而进行的斗争，认为这是完全合理的要求。匈牙利人民愤怒地谴责在中华人民共和国不可分割的部分台湾、南朝鲜、南越，所进行的斗争以及对南非等地人民所进行的帝国主义殖民压迫和恐怖行为。
    我们相信，帝国主义已不再能够阻挡为争取解放和独立而进行的斗争的进程；争取解放的殖民地人民的正义斗争一定会取得胜利。
    卡达尔谈到匈牙利人民共和国同北大西洋条约组织的领导国家及其政府之间的关系，认为是不能令人满意的。卡达尔说，我们特别同美利坚合众国政府有着严重的矛盾。
    卡达尔揭露了美国企图颠覆匈牙利人民政权和干涉匈牙利内政的活动。他说，美国参议院每年一亿二千五百万美元经费中，有相当一部分是用来进行反对匈牙利人民共和国的破坏活动。美国军队吸收了五千名匈牙利逃亡者。他们设立了所谓“自由欧洲”电台对匈牙利人民共和国进行着煽动性的攻击。我们两国有外交关系，但是，美国政府的官方代表却在联合国和其他国际组织中，反对匈牙利人民共和国官方代表的代表权，这种做法是没有先例的。美国反动集团妄图利用联合国的反匈决议达到干涉我国内政的目的。每年围绕这一决议所煽起的可笑的反匈运动，都是为反苏和冷战目的服务的。我们从不承认，将来也不会承认这一违背联合国宪章的非法决议。
    他说，尽管这样，我们仍然衷心地希望在美利坚合众国和匈牙利人民共和国之间建立起正常的关系，但是，问题的实质在于，美国政府必须遵守平等原则，放弃各种企图干涉匈牙利人民共和国内政的尝试。
    卡达尔接着谴责西德正在加紧武装，他们不顾一切地竭力保持冷战。匈牙利人民反对西德侵略。完全支持德意志民主共和国的和平政策。匈牙利人民共和国和德国第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国的目标完全一致。我们祝贺他们在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。我们为德意志民主共和国突飞猛进并于短期内在按人口平均计算的生产量和消费量方面赶上和超过德意志联邦共和国而感到高兴。我们祝德意志民主共和国的劳动人民在社会主义建设、加强国家和执行旨在保卫和平、使两个德国互相接近的政策中，取得新的成就。
    卡达尔谈到国际形势，他说在过去的两三年中，国际局势有了一定程度的缓和。产生这一变化的决定性原因，是苏联、社会主义阵营、国际工人运动、世界和平运动力量的增长和和平政策。然而，在资本主义国家和国际生活中进行活动并起着影响的反和平势力，也不容忽视。因此，各国人民必须继续对反和平的势力，进行坚决的斗争，迫使他们退却。
    卡达尔指出赫鲁晓夫访美的重要成就，受到了全世界爱好和平人士的欢迎。他说，苏联在联合国提出全面裁军的建议是一个突出的事件。赫鲁晓夫同志和艾森豪威尔总统在协议中肯定，必须通过谈判的途径解决国际争端问题。这一协议是有重大意义的。
    我们的任务是同苏联、同社会主义阵营所有国家一致有效地促进我们和平目标的实现。在各国和各民族间的关系中，我们支持全部实现和平共处原则。我们支持停止试验原子武器，建立无原子武器区，禁止使用并消灭原子武器。我们支持解决柏林问题和缔结对德和约的建议。我们支持苏联提出的全面裁军建议，并支持在这一建议未实现前采取过渡措施的办法：如裁减军队人数、取消外国军事基地、互撤驻扎在外国的军队。各国舆论都在催促举行谈判和达成协议。各国人民渴望消灭毁灭性的武器，要求全面裁军。匈牙利人民也要求能把自己的力量用于伟大的和平建设工作。他说，我们主张经过逐渐扩大国际联系的形式实现和平共处。
    （二）
    卡达尔在报告的第二部分谈到了匈牙利人民共和国的国内形势。
    卡达尔说，在过去三年中，国内政治形势的发展趋势是健康的，这种发展使我们的制度大为巩固。同反革命进行的斗争锻炼了和团结了社会主义力量。广大群众政治上大大地进步了，并在阶级斗争中取得了丰富的经验。在这斗争的过程中，我国的全民团结在社会主义思想的基础上进一步加强了。这种团结是在历史进步中诞生的。今天，这种正在发展的、新的民族团结比过去任何时期都更加坚强了。
    卡达尔谈到了匈牙利1956年的反革命暴乱，并根据党中央委员会的意见详细分析了事件的性质和产生的原因。他指出，1956年10月23日在布达佩斯爆发的武装暴乱和破坏匈牙利人民共和国国家和社会秩序的一切行为，都是旨在反对工人阶级政权、反对人民国家和匈牙利人民的社会主义斗争成果的，因此，都是资产阶级反革命性的。
    他说，拉科西及其集团所犯的错误是一个重要因素。这些错误尤其表现在忽视本国具体条件和民族特点方面，因此，在一定时期后，他们表现无能在我国正确运用建设社会主义的国际主要普遍法则。这些错误还表现在破坏党内民主、侵犯社会主义法制和歪曲经济政策方面。由于错误严重，延续持久，对已揭发的和被认清的错误又无能纠正。这就削弱了无产阶级专政；在党的生活中和国家领导工作中引起了严重危机。所有这些都为阶级敌人发动反革命暴乱提供了有利条件。
    纳吉·伊姆雷及其集团史无前例的叛变，起了严重的作用。他们从在党内进行派别活动起，一直堕落到同资产阶级和帝国主义结成秘密的或公开的联盟，放弃工人阶级政权，出卖阶级，促请帝国主义干涉，背叛祖国。他们把党的一些组织、裴多菲俱乐部和当时的作家协会变成为反革命的合法组织。他们帮助反革命势力，召集别有用心的会议，组织游行示威。他们破坏并且瘫痪了社会主义革命和人民国家的力量，为反革命夺取政权开辟了道路。
    国内反革命的主要力量是过去的大地主、资产阶级及其反动仆从，他们在早期被剥夺了政治权利、特权和经济基础，力图复辟资本主义和法西斯制度。这些过去的剥削阶级分子——他们在失去政权以后，思想上和政治上的影响，并没有完全清除，在他们的复辟计划中，国际帝国主义是他们的同盟者和支持者——迅速地重新组织了和动员了他们的力量。在短短的几天内，他们就组织了四十个号称全国性的政党。在这些政党中，有在反革命基础上重新组织起来的、过去曾经参加联合政府的三个政党，还有在两个州里已经公开展开活动的露骨的法西斯政党——箭十字党。除了过去统治阶级的政党外，他们还利用具有反革命纲领的所谓“工人委员会”和“革命”委员会，来达到他们的政治目的。
    卡达尔在谈到1956年反革命暴乱产生的原因时着重指出，以美国反动集团为首的国际帝国主义，是匈牙利爆发反革命暴乱最有利的因素。从匈牙利解放的第一天起，他们就利用他们所拥有的一切工具，支持匈牙利人民形形色色的敌人。多年以来，帝国主义就唆使、煽动反革命暴乱，并且进行组织工作，最后通过他们的代理人和政治同盟者，纳吉·伊姆雷及其集团和国内资产阶级反革命势力，终于发动了反革命暴乱。这样，国内的反革命势力和国际的帝国主义势力，两者彼此结成联盟，来反对匈牙利人民共和国。
    卡达尔说，我们党中央委员会，在1956年12月决议中，第一次全面而系统地对于1956年10月反革命暴乱，作了马克思主义的分析，采取了马克思主义的立场。关于这一点，我们可以向代表大会提出三个重要的事实：
    第一，我们认为，在1956年11月头几天和以后所发生的事件，是反革命性质的，这一论断的正确性已被事实所证明。后来发现的事实更加证实了这一点。第二，匈牙利全体劳动人民，都接受并同意我们的党对反革命暴乱原因和动力所作的分析。第三，国际共产主义运动和全世界的进步人士，都接受和赞同我们的估价。
    在反革命暴乱中，我们党和人民共和国的一切国内敌人都联合起来了。反革命势力一面在大谈其社会主义、民主、自由、革命，一面则武装进攻匈牙利人民共和国的机构，屠杀千百个忠于人民共和国的共产党人和进步人士。我们党，匈牙利社会主义工人党在严重情况下是执行了它的职责的。匈牙利的共产党人以对人民命运负责的精神，建立了新的革命中心、组织了斗争的领导力量新的中央委员会、成立了工农革命政府，并且请求我们忠实的、最好的朋友和同盟者——苏联的帮助。
    卡达尔说，当时历史给我们提到日程上来的问题，是严重的，复杂的。向我们发动进攻的是死敌，站在他们一边的还有受骗的和被引入歧路的人。在这种情况下，只有坚定的、原则性的政策和果断坚决，才能解决问题。
    一个问题是：是否允许继续不谈纳吉·伊姆雷等人已叛变到敌人的阵营中去了？回答只有一个：从根本上与叛徒完全决裂；在群众面前公开地说明情况；揭露和消灭叛徒。
    一个问题是：是否允许与武装的进攻者妥协，并且调查谁是甚么社会出身？回答只能是：对于武装进攻人民共和国及其任何机构的人，应该以武器来对付。
    一个问题是：对谁进行镇压和整肃，给谁自由和民主？回答只能是：应该给社会主义革命的战士和劳动人民以自由和民主，应该镇压和整肃反革命分子、妄图复辟的资产阶级分子及其形形色色的仆从。
    很清楚，只有对人民共和国忠诚，具有真正的爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的思想，才能够明确地、公开地同民族主义和民族仇恨的煽惑进行斗争。
    为了反对反革命分子的“中立”——其目的在于孤立我国，并且把我国拉到帝国主义的怀抱里——就必须不容误解地宣布：在华沙条约组织需要的时候，我们将一直忠实于它，并永远与社会主义阵营并肩前进。
    对我国政治制度将建立在甚么基础上这一问题，也必须作出明确的答复。我们的答复是：一个社会主义国家的政治制度，是不能建立在由反革命领导下的工人委员会和“革命委员会”的基础上的。我们把我们的政治制度，建立在领导工农联盟的马克思列宁主义政党、工会、爱国人民阵线和其他群众组织的基础上，摈弃了工人委员会的制度；把地方政权建立在已证明可行的人民政权的地方组织——各级地方议会的基础上，而不是建立在形形色色的反革命委员会的基础上。
    我国实行一党制，还是多党制？这个问题也被提出来了。对于作为无产阶级专政的一种形式的人民民主制度来说，工人阶级政党的领导作用是一个原则问题，是普遍规律。一党制或多党制并不是属于普遍规律的原则，而是根据一定的国家政治社会情况来决定的实际的政治问题。在反革命暴乱时期已经证明，在我国具体情况下，多党制是对反革命有利的，因此，我们摈弃了多党制。
    我们发展了党所领导的爱国人民阵线，代替了多党制。爱国人民阵线适合并且能够在政治上团结共产党人和那些在建成社会主义、保卫国家主权独立、加强人民共和国等基本目标方面意见一致的所有党外人士。三年来，新的、积极的经验证明，党所领导的爱国人民阵线是能够进行建设性工作的政治运动，这一运动，除共产党人外，还能团结无论原来属于某党派的、或一直是无党派的党外社会人士。
    对于在反革命暴乱中犯错误的人是惩办或是宽恕的问题，曾经是长期争论的问题。我们党的立场过去是，现在仍是：为了保障人民的切身利益，要求惩办反革命暴乱的发动者、领导者、组织者和进行屠杀的罪犯。但是，应该宽恕那些没有犯过重大罪恶的、受骗的或被蒙蔽的人。匈牙利人民共和国的司法机构就是这样作的，我们可以说，这符合人们的正义感，因此，这种惩办政策得到了人民的赞同和支持。
    经济情况也提出了不少严重问题。我们党对这些问题的答复是：反对煽惑，制止不劳动白分钱的现象，组织生产，建立劳动和工资纪律。
    对这些严重问题，要在原则上给予正确的答复，特别是给予适当的解决，要求党一方面坚决同向敌人妥协的分子和叛徒划清界线，另一方面，也要摆脱不相信群众和不敢依靠群众的持宗派主义观点的人。
    在严重情况中，党要同时解决两项很重要的任务：一个是摆脱过去的错误；一个是镇压反革命暴乱。党有能力完成、并且也已经完成了这两项任务。大胆的、公开的、坚定的马克思列宁主义立场和政策，带来了成果。党将长期注意到反革命暴乱的全部经验教训。但是，就反革命暴乱本身来说，在各方面都已遭到完全的失败，已经成为历史陈迹了。稳定、巩固和迅速发展是目前匈牙利人民共和国国内政治形势的特点。人民政权比反革命暴乱前更加坚强了，社会主义基础大大扩大了，社会主义建设在顺利地、蓬勃地进行着。如果没有群众在政治上的支持和勤奋，忘我的劳动，这种形势是不会形成的。
    卡达尔详细说明了苏联军队驻在匈牙利不是出于内政上的原因，而只是取决于那些尚未得到处理的国际问题。我们同苏联政府、参加华沙条约组织的各国政府以及所有社会主义国家的政府，一致主张就相互同时撤退在外国的驻军问题进行谈判。
    我们多次明确地表示苏联军队将留驻在匈牙利直到国际局势不需要这样作的时候为止。有人这样想，苏军撤出匈牙利会带来什么后果，关于这一点我们认为：这对反动派也不会有好处的。匈牙利社会主义革命的力量和社会主义革命的拥护者，已经学会了需要的东西，他们能够保卫我们的制度，免受国内敌人的侵犯。如果反动分子又想同我们较量，我们也不反对，因为匈牙利人民是有力量对付反革命分子的，同他们算账的地方还够多的呢。
    卡达尔在分析了1956年反革命暴乱事件以后说，我们吸取经验，不再重犯错误，我们不会忘记叛徒、阶级敌人和帝国主义者。在过去经验的基础上，我们要进一步加强我们的人民国家和我国的制度。我们要继续加强工农联盟，在国家生活中贯彻民主集中制的原则。在加强国家的集中领导的同时，继续扩大地方政权机关的权限。
    （三）
    卡达尔在报告的第三部分谈到了关于匈牙利经济情况和经济建设方面面临的任务。
    卡达尔说，我国经济形势可以说是好的。解放以来，我们在经济建设方面取得了伟大的成就。1949年以来，我国人民建立了一百个大型工业企业，诞生了新型的匈牙利社会主义工业城市。农业也表现着某种程度的发展，1935年全国只有拖拉机七千台，1959年已增加到三万一千台。1938年每霍尔特土地化肥的使用量只有十三点五公斤，1959年已提高到七十七公斤。生活水平十年内有了很大的提高，解放以来，经济生活中取得的伟大成就，具体的证明了社会主义制度胜过资本主义的伟大优越性。
    卡达尔说，三年前，经济生活曾一度瘫痪。生产停顿了，所谓的工人委员会，“革命”委员会组织着生产的进行，掠夺国民经济，瓦解了经济领导机构——使国家和劳动人民受到通货膨胀和经济危机的威胁。中央委员会和政府在与反革命暴徒进行武装斗争的同时，大力抓了恢复国民经济的问题，我们面向矿工、工人、农民，并且从兄弟的社会主义国家的领导者和人民那里求得了经济援助。
    首先是苏联，与此同时，中国和其他人民民主国家，都毫无例外地给予我们以帮助。除迅速的无偿援助外，苏联和其他人民民主国家以十二亿卢布的物质和自由外汇作为长期贷款支援我们。我们对兄弟国家的领导者和人民的这种帮助深表感谢。
    到1957年底国民经济已经得到恢复。社会主义工业恢复了，工业、农业都进行了生产。以适当价格的收购制代替了征购制，提高了城乡劳动人民的生活水平。
    在恢复了国民经济的基础和正常的经济工作条件以后，我们制订了经济工作的方针，并在这一方针的基础上制订了国民经济三年计划。
    国营工业生产比1955年提高了14％。劳动生产率比1955年提高8％。1958年的投资总额比1955年增加了二十三亿。
    由于1958年的优良成绩，1959年就有了更好的条件来开始建设。除了经济生活中取得的优良成绩之外，选举的伟大胜利、农业社会主义改造方面取得的巨大进展、具有鼓舞作用的苏共第二十一次代表大会都有助于劳动人民的信心，劳动情绪和热情的增长。这一切都是中央委员会能在今年3月决议中号召全国人民巩固大量新发展起来的和大大扩大了的合作社以及掀起更大的社会主义建设热潮的基础。
    中央委员会3月决议在劳动群众中引起了有利的热烈的反响。在布达佩斯党委会、工会全国理事会、切佩尔钢铁企业及其他很多大型工厂的联合倡议下广泛地开展了为迎接党代表大会而进行的劳动竞赛运动。我国劳动人民已于11月初完成了献礼的97％。
    今年年度计划头三季度在农业方面我们正在完成已经规定了的巩固生产合作社的任务。与去年同期相比，工业生产增长了12％，劳动生产率增长了4％。
    头三季度总的成绩表明了，我们能在工业生产和生产成本方面以及可能在劳动生产率方面也达到三月决议提出的目标，即提前一年在几个主要的指标方面达到三年计划中规定1960年底达到的水平。
    卡达尔接着谈到了匈牙利劳动人民生活水平不断提高的情况。他说：从1949年到1958年底职工的实际收入增加了56％，农民的实际收入增加了26％。1958年我国共支付的职工工资基金达四百一十九亿福林，工资以外的奖金总额达一百一十六亿福林。
    1958年的良好成就使中央委员会有可能把有关生活水平急待解决的几个问题提上日程。不久前政治局审查了中央委员会关于工人阶级的状况所作的决议的执行情况。现在我可以代表中央委员会向大会宣布，这个决议中涉及到生活水平问题的各点都已经实现了。
    卡达尔接着又谈到了匈牙利在经济建设方面所面临的任务。他说，经济建设、生产劳动服务于我们的社会目的。我国人民在最近几年内需要完成奠定社会主义基础的任务，并加速建成社会主义社会。
    在经济和生产战线上，我们的直接任务是实现今年和明年的计划以超额完成三年计划，从而为新五年计划创造更高的可靠的起点。现在要制订良好的新五年计划，并发动群众为贯彻这一计划而努力。
    计划应当保证工业生产到1965年底至少比1958年的水平提高65％—70％，农业生产则应增长30％—32％。国民收入至少要提高50％。在工业生产的增长中首先应使生产率提高37％—40％。
    我们应当进一步发展工业。应当保证重工业的更快发展，同时也要大量发展轻工业。要保证在整个国民经济中主要是通过技术水平的提高而提高生产率，力求生产经济化，降低生产成本。在今后几年中要使我国整个国民经济接近最发达的国家的经济水平。从发展的观点来看，今天的决定性问题是要消除农业生产在整个国民经济内部现存的相对落后现象。
    仍然有些问题是需要我们正视并加以解决，以便能保证国民经济更快的发展。在生产率的提高方面，由于最近六年中的震荡和挫折，我们落后于所有的社会主义国家的发展速度，克服在提高生产率方面存在的相对落后现象的主要条件是大力提高技术水平。
    卡达尔说，经济领导人完全应该学会，在工作中更好地依靠我国发展的最大动力——群众的积极性、意见和热情。对于今年在社会主义劳动竞赛和争取社会主义劳动称号的运动中所取得的重大经验，应该加以注意并且加以运用。经济领导人应该学会更好地运用社会主义国家经济合作中的可能性，以利于我国国民经济的发展。我们应当在经济互助委员会的组织内部，为实现更广泛的经济专业化和协作而努力。
    卡达尔说，关于代表大会的指示指出，新五年计划中保证生产资料数量上的适当增加和质量上的发展的同时，每个劳动者的实际收入最少应增加26％—29％，居民的消费基金到1965年至少应比现在提高40％—45％。
    新五年计划中有关建筑住宅的指标，对改善居民生活条件起着积极的作用。中央委员会曾建议把编制建筑住宅的十五年计划作为先于其它各项任务的首要问题。在三个五年计划期间，总共需要修建一百万所现代化的、符合卫生要求的新式住宅。这就是说，在十五年内，将有40％的居民迁入新居。换句话说，十五年住宅建筑计划的实现，能使所有需要单独住宅的家庭，都能得到满足。
    （四）
    卡达尔在报告的第四部分谈到了有关文化和教育问题。
    卡达尔说，我们党对于文化发展中当前需要解决的任务给予应有的重视。这是社会发展的本质问题，这也是属于使劳动人民生活更美好的一个问题。
    解放后在匈牙利劳动人民文化水平和一般文化发展中所出现的、巨大的量的发展，同时也是质的变化。这一提高，使人们更加接近在未来社会中具有社会主义思想的、全面发展的、有文化的人的水平——在文化方面更加接近社会主义革命的胜利。
    卡达尔叙述了匈牙利解放后十五年来在教育事业、科学、科学教育和科学研究方面，文学和艺术方面的巨大成就以后说，在文化战线上，社会主义革命的进展和胜利，虽然取得了伟大的成果，但是还相对地落后于政治、经济方面所取得的成就。要在文化方面、在人们的意识中战胜资本主义则更需要较长的时间。
    他说，目前，仍然感觉到反革命暴乱和修正主义煽惑在思想领域中的影响。同时，这也有它有利的一面：同反革命在这个战线上的斗争，加强了知识分子中的马克思主义骨干分子，加强了我们的科学、艺术事业，这也是教育群众的伟大学校。党关于教育政策的方针，关于文学问题、民粹派作家和民族主义问题的文件，是我们新的、有力的斗争武器。
    卡达尔指出，我们绝对要求科学和艺术事业更好地面向工人阶级、劳动群众和社会主义建设的需要，并为它们服务。科学和艺术事业应该有助于发展新的、社会主义的劳动态度和对待社会义务的态度，有助于加强社会主义爱国主义和国际主义，传播科学的世界观。
    必须克服资本主义制度遗留下来的思想——民族主义、修正主义、反犹太主义的残余。必须同阻碍社会主义胜利的小资产阶级思想，小私有者自私自利的思想，作坚决的、彻底的斗争。
    要达到这个目的，必须使马克思列宁主义思想在思想意识、科学文化方面成为占有统治地位的世界观。
    接着，卡达尔指出，我们的教育事业，必须改革。在教育的世界观内容方面，必须坚决把我们的学校改造成为社会主义性质的学校。要使学校更加接近生活。
    在新的五年计划中，我们要为发展科学保证必要的条件。国家对科学、科学家和研究人员的要求提高了，要求他们调整关于基础科学和实用科学的研究纲领，以便尽可能地适应我国社会的需要和经济文化发展中有待解决的问题。技术科学和农业科学对于我国国民经济的技术发展和促进农业的大规模生产方面，具有巨大的作用。
    卡达尔说，党的政策和现实生活的影响，推动了作家、艺术家的思想的进步。即使对在反革命事件时反党的作家集团这种影响也很大。但是，总还有些人落后于进步的形势。这些人应当面对着主要的问题，检查自己到底是同建设社会主义的人民站在一起呢还是脱离他们？人民期待每一个作家、艺术家，首先在自己的作品中对下列问题表示明确的态度：在阶级斗争中拥护什么人，同什么人站在一边？卡达尔指出艺术家、作家、记者、文化工作者，应当比以前更有目的地为了使社会主义思想和进步文化占领阵地而努力。对反动的资产阶级思想的残余，对小资产阶级的、粗制滥造的废品，对愚昧无知的现象和非科学的世界观的有害影响，应当比以前更有效地进行斗争。
    （五）
    卡达尔在报告的第五部分中谈到了农业社会主义改造等问题。
    他说，从继续发展我国社会主义社会制度这个观点看来，今后几年内结束农业社会主义改造，从而在我国奠定社会主义社会的基础，是一个决定性的任务。
    他指出，结束农业的社会主义改造，具有十分重大的政治意义，因为，新的社会主义农民的出现，将解决现存的各种矛盾，我国最主要的政治基础——工农联盟——将因此而成为牢不可破的，我们的工农国家——匈牙利人民共和国——也将因此而成为不可战胜的。
    他接着指出，从国民经济的观点看来，我们也必须进行农业的社会主义改造。目前在小块土地上进行的、落后的生产关系，是我国农业生产水平显著提高的主要障碍，同时，它还阻碍着整个国民经济的快速发展和人民生活福利进一步的显著提高。
    只有在社会主义的大规模经营中，用更多的机器、更好的灌溉、更多的肥料和化肥、更好的种子进行生产的现代化农业才有可能实现。今年农业作物的生产成绩，也说明了大规模经营和小规模经营的区别。今年，秋小麦每霍尔特的平均产量，国营农场为十三点四公担，生产合作社为十一公担，个体农民为八点六公担；秋大麦每霍尔特的平均产量，国营农场为十五公担，生产合作社为十三点五公担，个体农民为十一点八公担。玉米每霍尔特的平均产量，国营农场为十七点五公担，生产合作社为十六公担，个体农民为十四点四公担。个体劳动农民的上述生产成绩，也只是在付出了紧张的、艰苦的劳动之后才取得的。
    因此，卡达尔说，党和工人阶级必须通过宣传教育，在保证自愿原则的基础上，把个体劳动农民引向社会主义农业的道路，并且在组织工作和物质巩固方面帮助他们。应该耐心地、说服式地向个体劳动农民解释：只要他们从旧的农民生活方式的枷锁中解放出来，不再是有钱人或土地的奴隶，社会主义将为他们展现出多么美好的、新的人的生活！
    卡达尔在谈到工农联盟问题时说，工人阶级，是我们社会的领导阶级，是执政的“统治”阶级。过去和现在，他们都牺牲了个人利益，来援助兄弟阶级——农民，并且在我国建立了日益强大的社会主义工业。工人阶级今天正在领导着它的同盟者，为建立一个新的社会主义社会而斗争。今后，党的任务仍然是：帮助工人阶级广大群众提高觉悟、政治修养、业务知识和文化水平。农民，作为领导阶级工人阶级的同盟者，通过自己的方式，在为了反对霍尔蒂分子、国内法西斯分子、资产阶级和地主阶级，为了赢得人民政权而进行的斗争中，作出了贡献。在1956年资产阶级和法西斯势力发动反革命进攻的时期，农民证明了自己是工人阶级忠实的同盟者，参加了为保卫社会主义成果和争取形势巩固的斗争。今天，工农团结的基本内容，是共同保卫和加强人民政权，为建成社会主义社会而结成联盟。现在的任务是：在农村国营农场、生产合作社、机器站工作的最有觉悟的农民，应该帮助落后分子克服残存的自私自利思想，建立社会主义的匈牙利农村。
    卡达尔接着谈到了知识分子问题。他说，知识分子，就其作用来说，是我们社会的主要阶层。社会主义建设的发展，使知识分子的社会作用和创造的可能性，日益增长。党和政府对知识分子是信任和尊敬的，而且力求进一步改善知识分子的物质状况。各级党组织应该克服在有些地方出现的、对知识分子关门的现象和不信任的现象。
    接着卡达尔谈到了党对于改造小资产阶级分子、手工业者和小商贩的政策，他说，党争取用说服的办法在思想上和政治上改造小资产阶级，并用他们可以接受的方式，在保证他们个人的幸福和子女的前途的情况下，引导他们走上社会主义的道路。
    卡达尔谈到对剥削阶级的政策时说，一部分过去的剥削者及其支持者已适应了我们的社会。另一部分则在1956年起来反对人民政权，而且，今天也采取敌对态度。他们之间凡是曾反对过我国制度的人，我们也要把他们作为敌人来处理。我们要继续保持警惕，防止过去的剥削者破坏我国制度和我国人民的利益。他们当中谁要反对我国制度，谁就要考虑到无产阶级专政的威力。与此同时，反革命叛乱的平息、无产阶级专政的加强以及我们在社会主义建设中所取得的成就，也增长了改造过去剥削者的可能性。
    他说，反革命叛乱的平息并不意味着阶级斗争在我国的熄灭。没有阶级的社会是在阶级斗争中诞生的，这是社会发展规律。应该记住，我们的目标——完成社会主义的奠基工作和建成社会主义——要通过阶级斗争来实现。从社会主义和我国人民的利益出发，并不要求阶级斗争尖锐化，相反，如果其激烈性有所削减，其形式不太尖锐，倒是件好事。党和人民政权决不促使阶级斗争尖锐化。这首先不取决于我们，而是决定于我们的阶级敌人和国际帝国主义。
    他说，阶级斗争将继续进行下去。过去的剥削阶级分子，只要不违犯法律，尊重并安分守己地适应我国的社会制度，我们人民国家的法律就把他们作为享有平等权利的公民看待。我们对富农所采取的政策，也说明了这一点。我们曾在法令中指出，过去的富农可以抛弃他们自己的过去，在两年的老老实实的劳动以后，他们可以成为生产合作社的正式社员，可以被选为社的干部。对于过去的剥削者的子女，我们党努力使他们放下过去的包袱，在新的社会主义世界中找到自己的地位。
    卡达尔谈到了所谓流亡分子问题。他说，我们可以把流亡分子分为两个部分，其中的一小部分是些顽固的法西斯分子和罪犯，对于这些人，我们毫不惋惜。另一大部分流亡者是些在反动派和帝国主义的宣传的影响下，迷失方向的人，我们要帮助他们回到自己的故乡，重新在我们的社会里生活下去。流亡分子中，有不少人，在国内时就已经是帝国主义分子的代理人，或者是在国外受帝国主义者的收买而变成他们的忠实政治仆从。将来他们终会有一天要站在匈牙利劳动人民面前受审。
    （六）
    卡达尔在报告的第六部分谈到了关于党、党的领导作用以及党群关系的几个问题。
    卡达尔说，马克思列宁主义基本学说教导我们，没有党，没有党的领导，工人阶级就不可能夺取和保住政权；没有党的领导就不可能建成社会主义社会。
    修正主义者企图削弱党在社会主义国家日常生活中发挥领导作用的重大意义。匈牙利的经验显著和令人信服的表明，在取得政权以后，党和党的领导作用的意义不仅没有降低相反却有了增长。
    大家都知道，在那些反革命暴乱猖獗一时的日子里，人数要多得多的社会主义力量曾经在一段时间内无法有效地反对代表少数的反革命力量。造成这种情况的决定性的原因是：以前产生的各种错误和在反革命时期中开始变得明显的内部叛变，使党无法起应起的领导作用。
    当时，重新建党，重新组织工人阶级的领导力量，是革命力量进行有力反击的首要和必要条件。在同反革命作斗争的过程中，我们重新组织了党，到1957年5月1日止，这一工作已基本结束。
    指导匈牙利社会主义工人党的是马列主义的科学世界观；党的理论基础和共产主义政策并不是新的。新的只是；中央委员会在一系列偏向和错误之后又把党引导到正确的列宁的道路上来了，同时，在党的工作方法和工作作风上增添了今天使我们同广大劳动群众打成一片的新的因素。
    过去的斗争和经历是党的力量的泉源。党今天仍然从过去四十年的光辉革命经验中吸取力量。但是，在重新建党的时期中，党一方面固然要继承优良的革命传统；另一方面，也应该使自己从在最近几年中沾污了党的纯洁旗帜的个人迷信和修正主义的背叛耻辱中摆脱出来。
    今天，我们党吸取了各种经验教训，在斗争中得到了锻炼。它是强大和团结一致的，起着先锋队的作用，享有人民的信任，并且胜利地领导着高涨的社会主义建设劳动。
    卡达尔谈到关于反修正主义斗争和反教条主义的斗争。他说，为了捍卫党内团结的思想基础，为了马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁性，党在过去的三年中进行了两条战线的斗争，即反对修正主义与反对教条主义的斗争。
    党内出现的教条主义和修正主义倾向会损害工人阶级的思想武器。不论在匈牙利或是在国际上，这些倾向中的主要危险是修正主义。现代修正主义复活了尚未克服的旧的资产阶级思想；它勾结并依靠国际帝国主义和国内反动派；特别危险的是，现代修正主义总是披着马克思列宁主义的外衣出现于群众面前。
    修正主义的社会基础是由目前尚存在着的资产阶级和小资产阶级分子构成的。修正主义歪曲马克思主义的基本原理，否认党的领导作用，否认无产阶级专政国家的作用和社会主义阵营的意义。修正主义是同资产阶级民族主义紧密联系的，它在政治上必然会导致出卖工人阶级的利益。
    修正主义是一种企图在各国工人阶级内部破坏共产党地位的国际现象。修正主义实际上就是资产阶级所伪造的“马克思主义”。修正主义虽然具有最现代化的形式，但正如百年来所有对马克思主义的进攻都遭到了失败一样，它也是注定要失败的。在这方面，我国修正主义集团的全部不光彩的历史就是一个清楚的例证。这个集团中的很大一部分人从伪造马克思列宁主义学说起，一直发展到制造党内分裂，甚至最后投入阶级敌人的阵营、背叛祖国，全部地走完了修正主义所必然走的道路。
    今天，在中央委员会和基本党员群众中已经没有修正主义观点。修正主义分子给党带来的阴影，并不是党和支持党的群众的耻辱，而是这些叛徒的耻辱。
    卡达尔说，教条主义在本质上也是颠倒、歪曲马克思列宁主义的。尽管教条主义并不是来自资产阶级，而是在工人运动自己的土壤上产生的，但是它也会给党、工人阶级和无产阶级专政事业带来极大的损失。
    最近几年来，在拉科西·马加士周围形成的个人迷信以及由于个人迷信而采取的教条主义和宗派主义政策给党造成了严重的损失。然而，这个问题还有其混乱的一面，对这一点应该作出结论。拉科西·马加士在1919年曾为苏维埃共和国作过斗争，在反霍尔蒂法西斯的斗争中也起过卓越的作用，在解放后的政治斗争中也起过领导作用。但是在无产阶级专政取得胜利后，最初他是容忍了个人迷信，以后则是他自己也鼓励个人迷信，因而给社会主义事业造成了严重的损失。从本质上看来，在最初几年中支持拉科西的有益行动的人作得是正确的，当他们看到拉科西的严重错误及其错误的顽固性时，就收回了自己对领袖的信任，并且批判了他，这样作也是正确的。匈牙利的共产党人、匈牙利党和早期跟随拉科西的群众不必为个人迷信，为它所造成的严重损失和给党带来的阴影而感到惭愧，感到惭愧的应当是那些造成这些错误的人，拉科西本人和支持其错误的集团。
    卡达尔接着谈到了党的教育情况。他说，在党的教育方面，我们也取得了成绩。宣传员的马克思主义修养和文化水平也有很大的提高。当前的局势要求我们加强马克思列宁主义的宣传，首先是提高党员的马克思列宁主义水平。
    卡达尔谈到关于党的组织情况时说，我们有一万六千八百零五个党的基层组织，四十万零二千四百五十六名党员和三万五千五百名预备党员。60％的党员和56％的预备党员，按他们原来的职业，都是工人。14％的党员和19％的预备党员是劳动农民。
    根据我们的经验，党员的人数对于党是否能保持其先锋队的性质，也具有原则性的意义。中央委员会认为，过去我们党的组织范围过于广泛，以致影响了党的先锋队的性质。在重新建党的过程中，中央委员会考虑到这一经验，对于党的组织范围，力求适当加以控制。今天，尽管我们党员的人数只有过去的一半，但是我们仍然有权利说，党比反革命事件前强大了。今天的党真正是那些思想原则一致的人们的自愿的战斗联盟，党的工作作风在过去三年内有了很大的发展。这种共产主义工作作风的特点是，坚持原则，信任群众，坦率，干劲和踏实。为了继续发展党内生活和党的工作，我们必须克服尚存的错误观点，提高我们的理论、政治和业务水平。各级党组织都必须更深入地从事经济工作和文化建设工作；必须继续改进干部工作；必须更加有始有终地执行党的决议，改进对决议执行情况的检查工作。
    卡达尔接着谈到了党和群众的关系。他说，联结党和我国人民的千千万万条纽带，是通过各种群众组织、群众运动和与群众之间的直接联系建立和壮大起来的。没有党和人民之间的相互信任和紧密联系，党就不能生活，不能工作。
    他谈到了工会、共产主义青年团和妇联的工作以及它们的重要性。他说，今天，群众组织和群众运动正在党的思想、政治领导下，独立地工作着，根据不同的性质，起着各自应有的作用，基本上良好地起着党群之间的桥梁作用。
    卡达尔然后谈到党和群众也保持着直接的联系。这种联系的表现形式是多种多样的，例如：报刊、广播电台、召开会议、举行公开的党日活动、居民区党小组的日常工作、全体共产党员经常应该做的宣传工作、共产党员和党外群众之间的个人接触等等。党把成就和困难，坦率地、直接地、公开地告诉最广大的党外群众。三年来，在党和党外群众之间，正是这种坦率和真诚创造了相互信任的重大道义资本。继续加强这种相互信任，是今后党取得成功的关键。他说，必须反对官僚主义和对人对事的冷淡无情，必须以最认真的态度处理人们的各种事情、问题、意见和要求。党组织应该严肃地对待这些问题，并给人们以各种指导。有关的问题应该转达给有关组织，并且关心它们的处理情况。
    卡达尔接着谈到党的国际联系。他说，我们的党是爱国主义的和国际主义的党。我国的社会主义革命，只有同国际共产主义运动紧密地团结在一起，才能得到发展。
    正如我们所能希望的那样，我们同各兄弟党，共产党工人党和其中最有经验、最强大的党——苏联共产党之间的关系，是最深厚的和最良好的。
    我们认为，向我国人民学习，从国际共产主义运动的经验中学习，是我们的任务。中央委员会认为：在过去三年的斗争中，在注意到我国具体条件和民族特点的同时，我们正确地理解和运用了阶级斗争的国际经验和社会主义建设的主要国际规律。
    卡达尔说，在谈到党的国际联系时，我必须指出，我们和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间的关系恶化了，现在我们两党之间没有正式的联系。这种情况的基本原因是，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导集团修正了马克思主义。他们提出的理论论点和采取的实际措施，有害于国际共产主义运动，有害于我们的党。
    我们之间发生了争论。1956年12月，他们公开向我们建议不要重新建党，因为这种尝试是“枉费心机”的；他们建议我们把我国的政治制度建立在所谓工人委员会的基础上，以此来代替党。我们对他们纲领中所提出的、反马克思主义的论点——其中包括关于国家学说、关于对社会主义阵营全面评价的论点——展开了争论。我们认为，接受他们的论点，就意味着使工人阶级在同资产阶级和国际帝国主义所进行的斗争中解除武装。
    大家知道，1949年秋后的一段时期中，匈牙利方面也发生了一些错误，损害了两党，甚至两国之间的关系。但是，1953年夏天以来，匈牙利方面不断努力改善这种关系，这也是事实。从那时以来，匈牙利方面从来没有企图干涉南斯拉夫党的内政的任何事例。可是在另一方面，情况正相反，1956—1957年期间，对于我们党和我国的内政，发生了一系列的干涉和干涉的尝试。
    卡达尔说，匈牙利社会主义工人党的活动的政治思想基础，是建筑在马克思列宁主义经典著作的学说、概括我国经验的党的历次决议、苏联共产党第二十次、第二十一次代表大会的决议和最近一次总结了国际共产主义运动最重要经验的1957年11月莫斯科宣言上的。我们把对各国都适用的、社会主义建设的主要规律，作为基础，同时在考虑到我们民族的特点和我们国内的条件的情况下，争取在生活中实现这些规律。我们认为，我们党是马克思列宁主义的政党，马克思列宁主义政党的主要原则基础之一是无产阶级国际主义。因此我们党过去是、现在是、将来也是国际主义的政党。×××
    卡达尔最后指出，党当前的任务，总结起来说，就是在最近几年内结束社会主义社会的奠基工作。随着经济和文化建设任务更好更快的解决，使社会主义革命在我国取得彻底的、最终的胜利的日子早日到来。
    完成上述任务的条件是：在党内要保卫我们的思想基础——马克思列宁主义——的纯洁性；要创造性地运用科学的理论，执行明确而坚定的共产主义的政策。
    我们要在执行政策时，注意彻底性和彻底性的不可分割。今后思想斗争的主要火力，应该指向敌对的资产阶级观点和修正主义观点的残余。同时，今后我们也不向教条主义和宗派活动让步。
    很明显，这次代表大会将对很多过去的问题作出结论。我们不会忘记经验，但是，那些已经过去了的问题，我们也应该放到历史里去了。我们要向前看，看到明天的任务，集中力量来解决这些任务。
    今天，匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利人民共和国是强大的，国际条件很好。我们党、党的各级组织和每个党员，都应该比以前更加热情地进行工作。
    党应该更好地依靠群众，群众更加紧密地团结在党的周围。匈牙利人民必须同苏联和社会主义阵营其它国家人民结成更紧密的友谊，必须更加紧密地同日益强大的国际社会主义和和平的力量团结在一起。我们确信：社会主义在我国得到彻底的胜利也是指日可待的；匈牙利人民多少世代以来最美好、最真实的理想——社会主义的匈牙利——将会建立起来。（附图片）
