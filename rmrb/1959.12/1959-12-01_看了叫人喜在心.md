    Makes you happy to see
    Pigsties, you can't count them all,
    Pigs in groups and more groups,
    Mother pig shakes her head, leading the way,
    Piglets wag their tails, following behind,
    Every one of them is fat and strong,
    Makes you happy to see.
    Whose pigs are so good?
    Without the commune, how could it be?
            (Kang Yuanying)
    Big pigs are fat, little pigs are strong,
    The commune's pig raising is really great.
    Get up early, before dawn,
    Carrying a vegetable basket in hand.
    Radishes, water hyacinth,
    Pigs eat them fragrant and sweet.
    Set a time, diligently feed,
    Gaining two or three jin of fat a day.
    Clean diligently, accumulate more fertilizer,
    Grains and vegetables all have bumper harvests.
          (Qiu Xiaofu)
    Fat pigs are tall and tall,
    Stand on a stool to touch its waist,
    If you want to give it a bath,
    Carry a bucket of water and pour it on its back,
    Pour two buckets of water,
    And only wet a handful of hair!
              (Qingpu Field Song)
    Pig-raising girl busy and busy,
    Leaving early and returning late at the pig farm;
    Feeding the pigs big and fat,
    The girl is happy to sing a song.
    Singing of fat pigs filling the pens,
    Singing of manure and full granaries;
    Singing of members' increased income,
    Singing of the commune being better than paradise.
              (Xiao Guobin)

### 看了叫人喜在心

    看了叫人喜在心猪舍座座数不清，猪儿一群又一群，母猪摇头前面领，小猪摆尾后面跟，只只长得胖又壮，看了叫人喜在心。谁家猪儿这样好？不是公社哪能行？
            （康元英）大猪肥，小猪壮，公社养猪棒又棒。早早起，天未明，采菜篮儿手上提。莱菔菜，水浮莲，猪儿吃了香又甜。定时间，勤喂料，一天长膘二三斤。勤打扫，多积肥，五谷蔬菜都丰登。
          （丘小甫）肥猪个子高又高，搭张凳子摸着它腰，要想给它洗个澡，提着水桶背上浇，浇了两桶水，才湿了一把毛！
              （青浦田歌）养猪姑娘忙又忙，起早恋晚在猪场；喂得猪儿大又肥，姑娘乐得把歌唱。一唱肥猪圈圈满，二唱粪多粮满仓；三唱社员收入多，四唱公社赛天堂。
              （萧国宾）
