A Point of Discussion

Regarding Wang Che's article "Classic Works Should Be Read Repeatedly" published on page seven of the People's Daily on October 21st, in its examples, it compared philosophy and mathematics, stating, "For example, learning mathematics is very hierarchical; you either understand or you don't. Once you understand a certain theorem in mathematics, you cannot understand it more; it's difficult to say that there's a difference in the depth of understanding of this theorem among all students who understand it." "Therefore, reviewing mathematics textbooks is usually only to avoid forgetting, and it is difficult to talk about 'gaining new insights through reviewing old material.'"

Comrade Wang Che's article aims to guide people in studying dialectical materialism, but his view of mathematics is one-sided. Mathematics is a branch of natural science; it expresses the laws of quantity in the objective world in the form of theorems. Therefore, whether one understands a mathematical theorem includes whether one has mastered these laws and can apply these laws to solve problems. Because of different ways of thinking and different levels of knowledge, each person's understanding of the same theorem is different. Mathematics is simpler than philosophy in some aspects, but mathematics is by no means purely formal logic, but implements dialectics, has rich content, and is by no means so rigid that you either understand or you don't, and you cannot gain new insights through reviewing old material.

The reader's opinion is correct. After reconsidering this issue, I feel that although the concepts and principles in mathematics are very abstract in form, the understanding of these concepts and principles still has different depths and is not static; otherwise, it cannot explain the development of mathematics. Engels once pointed out that both "zero" and "one" have rich dialectical content. My article only compared philosophy and mathematics based on certain superficial phenomena, emphasizing the differences between the two, but did not explain that the development of all knowledge departments follows the common laws of dialectics, which is inappropriate.

    一点商榷
    10月21日人民日报七版王澈同志写的“经典著作要反复阅读”一文，在举例中曾把哲学和数学做了对比，说“比如学数学，就是层次分明的，懂就是懂，不懂就是不懂。对于数学上的某一条定理，你一旦懂了，就不能更多懂一些；所有懂得这一条定理的学生对这一条定理的理解很难说有什么深浅的差别。”“所以复习数学教科书，通常只是为了不致遗忘，而很难谈到温故而知新。”
    王澈同志写的文章是指导人们学习辩证唯物主义的，但他在对数学的看法上，却是片面的。数学是自然科学的一个分支，它把客观世界中数量的规律用定理的形式表达出来，因此对一个数学定理是否懂了，就包含着是否已掌握了这些规律和能够应用这些规律去解决问题。因为思考的方法不同，知识广博程度不一样，对同一个定理的认识，每个人理解的程度也不一样。数学比起哲学来，在某些方面是简单得多，但是数学决非单纯的形式逻辑，而是贯彻了辩证法的，它有丰富的内容，决不是呆板到懂就是懂，不懂就是不懂，温故不能知新的境地。 　广州　小木
    读者的意见是对的。我重新考虑了一下这个问题，觉得数学中的概念和原理尽管在形式上非常抽象，但对这些概念和原理的理解仍然是有深浅不同的，并不是僵死的，不然，就不能说明数学的发展了。恩格斯就曾指出过，“零”和“一”都有丰富的辩证的内容。我那篇文章只是根据某些表面现象把哲学和数学作了比较，强调了两者的不同，却没有说明一切知识部门的发展都遵照着共同的辩证法的规律，这是不妥当的。　王澈
