Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 13th. The Iraqi newspaper "People's Unity" published an editorial today stating that Eisenhower's visit to India is a link in his trip to some European, Asian, and African countries. The purpose of this trip is to strengthen the military treaties in this region of the world and attempt to pull some neutral countries into these treaties or to cooperate with these treaties in one form or another.

    Referring to the US government's attitude towards India, the newspaper said that Eisenhower had said before starting this visit that he had decided to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue with Prime Minister Nehru, and at the same time he said that he supported India's viewpoint.

    The newspaper pointed out that imperialism and its agents in Asia, especially the reactionary forces in India, have decided to use the Sino-Indian dispute to intensify the tension in the situation and keep India far away from the road of cooperation with China, thereby distancing it from its peaceful policies.

    The newspaper then said that the enemies of peaceful coexistence within India have become active. Former Indian Army Chief of Staff Cariappa has demanded that India abandon neutrality and try to conclude an agreement with Pakistan on the "common defense of the Indian subcontinent." In Pakistan, Foreign Minister Qadir said that Pakistan might rise up to "help" India and urged India to agree to Pakistan's proposal to establish a "common defense alliance." The newspaper pointed out, "In this way, the insidious purpose of the movement to 'support' India and oppose China is very clearly revealed."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13th. "People's Daily" published a commentary today saying that although the US propaganda machine is trumpeting the "peace envoy" role of Eisenhower's visit abroad, the people clearly see that Eisenhower's visit abroad is not for peaceful sincerity, but to save the "prestige" of the United States, understand the contradictions between the United States and its Western European allies, and strengthen the war bloc headed by the United States. People know that there has been no fundamental change in US foreign policy. When Eisenhower sings "peace, freedom, and justice," the belligerent forces of the US ruling clique are continuing to clamor for the Cold War.

    The commentary pointed out that US war policy is creating tensions in some countries in Asia and Africa. The United States is colluding with the Kishi Nobusuke government in a conspiracy to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty" to legalize the US military's occupation of Japan and use Japanese troops to carry out its military adventures in Asia. In Indochina, the United States is stepping up its efforts to turn Laos and South Vietnam into its war bases. The commentary asked: How can Eisenhower's sweet words deceive the people of Asia?

    The commentary emphasized that the communiqués issued by Eisenhower with the authorities of Turkey, Pakistan, and other countries show the intention of the United States to try its best to consolidate the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the Central Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Military Group. It is worth noting that recently, the United States has been trying its best to sow discord between the People's Republic of China and its neighbors such as Pakistan and India, especially by using border issues.

    The commentary pointed out that all these blatant "going south by driving the chariot north" tricks of the United States only expose the conspiracy of the United States to pretend to be "peace-loving" on the one hand, while intensifying preparations for war on the other.

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 13th. The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" revealed the tricks played by Eisenhower's visit abroad in a commentary today. The commentary pointed out that there is a sharp contradiction between the hypocritical slogans of "peace and justice" touted by Eisenhower's visit and his actual actions.

    The commentary pointed out that Eisenhower did not forget to talk about peace in every speech, but in Italy he strongly supported the right-wing government's Cold War policy. When Eisenhower visited Turkey, Turkish officials announced their willingness to cooperate with the United States in establishing new US rocket bases. It was discussed that the US President also intervened in the dispute between Pakistan and India over the Kashmir issue.

    The commentary said that the visit to India was considered a very important visit in the entire journey. In India, Eisenhower tried his best to prove the necessity of the US armed forces, saying that these armed forces "serve not only us, but also our friends and allies." Eisenhower's speech made Indian public opinion even more convinced that the US government only thinks of military aid programs, military bases, and military blocs around the world.

    伊“人民团结报”说艾森豪威尔支持印度观点
    美国想拉中立国家参加军事集团
    越匈报纸指出美国玩弄和平把戏骗不了人
    新华社巴格达13日电　伊拉克“人民团结报”今天发表社论说，艾森豪威尔访问印度是他访问一些欧洲、亚洲和非洲国家的旅行中的一个环节，这次旅行的目的是要加强世界这个地区的军事条约，并企图把某些中立国家拉入这些条约，或者通过这种或那种形式同这些条约合作。
    这家报纸在提到美国政府对印度的态度时说，艾森豪威尔在开始进行这次访问之前就曾经说，他决定同尼赫鲁总理讨论中印边界问题，同时他说，他支持印度的观点。
    这家报纸指出，帝国主义及其在亚洲的代理人特别是印度的反动力量决定利用中印争端来加剧局势中的紧张程度，并使印度远远离开同中国合作的道路，从而使它离开它的和平政策。
    这家报纸接着说，印度国内的和平共处的敌人已经变得活跃起来。前印度陆军总司令卡里阿帕要求印度放弃中立，设法同巴基斯坦缔结“关于印度次大陆的共同防御”的协定。在巴基斯坦，外交部长卡迪尔说，巴基斯坦可能起来“帮助”印度，并力促印度同意巴基斯坦要求成立“共同防御联盟”的主张。这家报纸指出，“这样，‘声援’印度、反对中国这一运动的阴险目的就非常清楚地显露出来了”。
    新华社河内13日电　“人民报”今天发表评论说，尽管美国的宣传机关大吹大擂艾森豪威尔出国访问的“和平使者”作用，但人民清楚地看到，艾森豪威尔出国访问并不是为了和平诚意，而在于挽救美国的“威信”，了解美国同西欧的盟国之间的矛盾和加强美国为首的战争集团。人们知道，美国的对外政策并没有根本的改变。当艾森豪威尔高唱“和平、自由、正义”的时候，美国统治集团好战势力却在继续叫嚣冷战。
    评论指出，美国战争政策，造成亚洲、非洲一些国家的紧张局势。美国正在勾结岸信介政府阴谋修改日美“安全条约”以使美国军队盘据在日本合法化，并使用日本军队来进行它在亚洲的军事冒险活动。在印度支那，美国正在加紧把老挝和南越变成它的战争基地。评论问道：艾森豪威尔的花言巧语怎么能够欺骗亚洲人民呢？
    评论着重指出，艾森豪威尔同土耳其、巴基斯坦等国当局发表的会谈公报，表明了美国竭力巩固北大西洋侵略集团、中央条约组织和东南亚军事集团的意图。值得注意的是，最近，美国千方百计地在中华人民共和国和巴基斯坦、印度等邻国之间进行挑拨离间，特别是利用边界问题。
    评论指出，所有美国这些露骨的“南辕北辙”的把戏，结果只是揭穿了美国一方面装扮一副“爱好和平”的姿态，另一方面却加紧准备战争的活动的阴谋。
    新华社布达佩斯13日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”今天在一篇评论中，揭露了艾森豪威尔这次出国访问所玩弄的把戏。评论指出，艾森豪威尔这次访问所标榜的“和平和正义”的虚伪口号与他的实际行动之间存在着尖锐矛盾。
    评论指出，艾森豪威尔在他的每次讲话中都没有忘记谈谈和平，但是，他在意大利却大力支持右翼政府的冷战政策。当艾森豪威尔访问土耳其时，土耳其官方宣布愿意同美国合作建立新的美国火箭基地。讨论说，美国总统还插手巴基斯坦和印度之间关于克什米尔问题的纠纷。
    评论说，对印度的访问被认为是整个旅程中很重要的访问，在印度，艾森豪威尔竭力证明美国武装力量的必要性，他说，这些武装力量“不仅是为我们服务，而且同时也为我们的朋友和盟邦服务的”。艾森豪威尔的演说更使印度舆论深信，美国政府在全世界只想到军事援助纲领、军事基地和军事集团。
