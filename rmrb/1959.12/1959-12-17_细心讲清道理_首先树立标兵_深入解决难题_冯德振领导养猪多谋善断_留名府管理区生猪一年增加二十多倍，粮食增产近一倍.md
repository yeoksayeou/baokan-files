This newspaper's Tianjin dispatch on the 16th: Feng Dezhen, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Liumingfu Management District of Wangqiansi Commune in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, has played an outstanding leadership role in the great development of pig raising in the entire management district. Under the leadership of the Party General Branch Committee and him, in the past year, the number of pigs in the entire management district has increased from 96 to 2,826; the 15,000 mu of land in the district, due to the increase in pig manure, has been fertilized with an average of 4,500 jin per mu this year; the total grain output has increased from 1.35 million jin last year to more than 2.56 million jin. Because of the abundance of pigs, fertilizer, and grain, the poor face of the management district has begun to change.

The natural conditions of the Liumingfu Management District are not bad. After liberation, production has continued to develop, but the root of poverty has not been completely eradicated. Feng Dezhen deeply studied the local situation and found that this was due to the lack of fertilizer, the laziness of the land, and the inability to rapidly increase grain production. Therefore, Feng Dezhen was determined to mobilize the masses in the entire district to raise pigs in large numbers to change the face of poverty. First, he selected the Kuixingzhuang Production Team as the focus of developing pig raising, and set up a red flag for pig raising in the entire district, commune, and county.

Feng Dezhen used the methods of "explaining, calculating, and showing" to publicize the benefits of raising pigs and encourage the enthusiasm of commune members to raise pigs. He often used very simple analogies, such as "People can't live without salt, land can't live without manure," to explain the principle that more manure can lead to more grain, and encourage the masses to raise pigs. Just explaining the principles is not enough, he also worked with the masses to calculate the detailed accounts of raising pigs, calculating how many carts of manure a pig can accumulate in a year, how many jin of grain a cart of manure can increase when applied to the land, and how much profit can be gained from raising a fat pig. For example, in order to mobilize the Kuixingzhuang Production Team to raise pigs in large numbers, Feng Dezhen and the team's accountant, Zhang Jiguang, calculated the "three accounts" of the Kuixingzhuang Production Team (the account of increasing production through pig raising and manure accumulation, the account of increasing income, and the account of improving life). After the calculations, the enthusiasm of all the commune members in the team to raise pigs was boosted. The number of pigs in this team soared from 17 to 257. Due to the abundance of fertilizer, grain production jumped from 80,000 jin last year to more than 149,000 jin, transforming from a grain-deficient team to a surplus-grain team. Feng Dezhen closely relied on the Party organization and commune members to explore a complete set of pig-raising experiences in the Kuixingzhuang Production Team, and continuously organized commune members from other production teams to visit the site throughout the year, setting off a high tide of pig raising and manure accumulation in the entire management district.

In order to adapt to the new situation of large-scale pig raising, the Party General Branch Committee of the Liumingfu Management District decided to vigorously promote collective pig raising, because collective pig raising makes it easier to solve problems such as pig sources, feeding, and pig pens, and is easier to promote the high-speed development of pigs, and decided to focus on supporting poor teams to raise pigs in large numbers. Feng Dezhen conscientiously implemented the decision of the Party General Branch and first helped the Xinzhuang Production Team to prepare for the construction of a collective pig farm. He specifically led the production team to build a collective pig farm in three days using self-reliance, raising 185 pigs. Under Feng Dezhen's promotion, all the production teams in the management district learned from the experience of the Xinzhuang Team and quickly built 24 collective pig farms, raising 2,526 pigs, accounting for 89% of the total number of 2,826 pigs in the entire management district.

At that time, feed was generally felt to be lacking. Some people thought it was best to feed more grain. While criticizing this argument, Feng Dezhen remembered the saying that pigs eat all kinds of grass, and personally went to the fields to find wild feed. As a result, he found a large area of ​​alkali land where "ququcai" grew vigorously, which pigs scrambled to eat when used to feed them. As a result, a mass movement to collect and store roughage for pigs formed throughout the management district. After the masses searched and experimented, there were as many as seventy or eighty kinds of agricultural and sideline products, wild vegetables, weeds, etc. that could be used as pig feed. In addition to feeding freshly collected feed, they also stored enough feed for five months.

Now, under the leadership of the Party General Branch and Feng Dezhen, all the commune members of the Liumingfu Management District continue to raise pigs in large numbers, and decided to strive to develop the number of pigs in the entire district to 15,000 in 1960, achieving the goal of one pig per mu.

    细心讲清道理　首先树立标兵　深入解决难题
    冯德振领导养猪多谋善断
    留名府管理区生猪一年增加二十多倍，粮食增产近一倍
    本报天津16日电　河北省吴桥县王谦寺公社留名府管理区党总支书记冯德振，在全管理区养猪大发展中，发挥了出色的领导作用。在党总支委员会和他的领导下，一年来，全管理区的生猪由九十六只增加到两千八百二十六只；全区的一万五千亩土地，由于猪肥增多，今年每亩平均施肥四千五百斤；粮食总产量由去年的一百三十五万斤提高到二百五十六万多斤。因为猪多、肥多、粮多，开始改变了管理区的贫困面貌。
    留名府管理区自然条件并不错，解放后，生产不断发展，但是还没有彻底挖掉穷根。冯德振深入地研究了当地的情况，发现这是由于肥少、地赖、粮食产量不能迅速提高的缘故。因此，冯德振下定决心发动全区群众大量养猪，改变贫困面貌。首先他选择魁星庄生产队作为发展养猪的重点，在全区全社全县树起了一面养猪红旗。
    冯德振用“讲、算、看”的办法，宣传养猪的好处，鼓舞社员养猪的积极性。他经常用十分通俗的譬喻，例如“人不吃盐不行，地不上粪不行”的话，来说明多上粪能多打粮的道理，鼓励群众养猪。光讲道理不行，他还和群众在一起算养猪的细账，算一口猪一年能积多少车粪，一车粪施到地里能多打多少斤粮，养一口肥猪能得多少利。例如为了发动魁星庄生产队大量养猪，冯德振和这个队的会计张继广算了魁星庄生产队的“三笔账”（养猪积肥增产账、增加收入账、改善生活账）。算账以后，鼓起了全队社员养猪的劲头。这个队的生猪由十七只猛增到二百五十七只。由于肥料多，粮食产量由去年的八万斤跃增到十四万九千多斤，由缺粮队变成了余粮队。冯德振紧紧地依靠党组织和社员群众，在魁星庄生产队摸索出了一整套的养猪经验，并且在一年中不断组织其他生产队的社员到现场参观，掀起了全管理区的养猪积肥的高潮。
    为了适应大量养猪的新形势，留名府管理区党总支委员会决定大抓集体养猪，因为集体养猪易于解决猪源、饲养、圈棚等问题，易于推动生猪高速度发展，并且决定着重支持穷队大量养猪。冯德振认真执行了党总支的决定，首先帮助辛庄生产队筹建集体养猪场。他具体地领导这个生产队用自力更生的办法在三天内建起了集体猪场，养了一百八十五只猪。在冯德振的推广下，全管理区各生产队学习辛庄队的经验，很快建起了二十四个集体养猪场，养猪二千五百二十六只，占全管理区生猪总数二千八百二十六只的89％。
    当时饲料普遍感到缺乏。有人认为只好多喂些粮食。冯德振一面批判这种论调，一面想起猪吃百样草的话，亲自到田野中去寻找野生饲料。结果在大片碱地里发现了生长茂盛的“曲曲菜”，用来喂猪，猪抢着吃。于是一个群众性的给猪打储粗饲料的运动就在全管理区形成了。经过群众们寻找、试验，农副产品、野菜、杂草等，足有七、八十种可以作猪饲料。除了现打现喂外，还储备了足够五个月的饲料。
    现在，留名府管理区全体社员，在党总支和冯德振的领导下，继续大量养猪，决定争取1960年使全区生猪发展到一万五千只，实现一亩地一头猪的目标。
