Xinhua News Agency, December 30th. In 1959, China's mechanical industry successfully trial-manufactured many high-efficiency, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge products.

　　Large Metallurgical Equipment and Power Generation Equipment
　　Trial manufacturing complete sets of large equipment is a prominent feature of the mechanical industry's leap to high, large, precise, and cutting-edge products this year. To support the "marshal" of steel and the "vanguard" of electricity, many complete sets of large metallurgical equipment and power generation equipment were successfully trial-manufactured this year. These include a large section steel rolling mill with a roll diameter of 800 mm, a medium plate rolling mill with a roll length of 2,300 mm, and a seamless steel pipe rolling mill with a rolling diameter of 76 mm; a large blast furnace equipment with an effective volume of 1,513 cubic meters and a complete set of equipment for a 500-ton large open-hearth furnace; a 50,000 kW hydrogen-cooled turbo-generator and its supporting high and medium-pressure turbines and power station boilers, which can provide electricity for lighting a city with a population of 2.5 million; and a 72,500 kW hydro-generator unit, which has a single unit capacity 90 times higher than that of the hydro-generator units that China began producing in 1951. The electricity it generates is enough to light a large city with a population of about 3.5 million. In addition, there are corresponding large transmission and transformation equipment, including the largest 220 kV, 60,000 kVA power transformer, which can be used by large power stations to transmit electricity to areas 300 kilometers away. In order to process heavy equipment, the machine tool industry department also successfully trial-manufactured a batch of large machine tools this year. The five-meter vertical lathe trial-manufactured by Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant can process workpieces that are two meters high, five meters in diameter, and weigh 35 tons. Except for some equipment of the 1,513 cubic meter large blast furnace and the 72,500 kW hydro-generator, which were produced in 1958, the rest of the products were successfully trial-manufactured this year. These products are characterized by large size and complex matching. For example, the 72,500 kW hydro-generator unit weighs a total of 1,000 tons and is 20 meters high, equivalent to a five-story building. The large shaft of the hydro-turbine "rotor" requires two people to hold hands to embrace it; the five-meter vertical lathe weighs a total of 68 tons and has more than 2,500 kinds of large and small parts, totaling more than 10,000 pieces. This year's production of these large machines, due to the adoption of advanced scientific achievements, has made many reforms in structure, and therefore has many improvements compared with China's existing equipment of the same specifications. For example, the complete set of 800 mm rolling mill equipment weighs only more than 6,000 tons, which is much lighter than China's existing rolling mill of the same specification. In addition, the roll neck has been strengthened, so it can withstand a larger reduction and produce more steel; the 50,000 kW hydrogen-cooled turbine uses hydrogen cooling, which reduces the volume of the generator compared to the past air cooling and opens up the way for the development of larger capacity power generation equipment in the future.

　　New High-Efficiency Automatic Cold Headers and Automatic Vertical Lathes
　　In terms of manufacturing high-efficiency products, the mechanical industry has also made great achievements this year. More than ten new high-efficiency automatic cold headers have been successfully trial-manufactured and put into production. This kind of machinery is very efficient and can save a lot of metal. Using them to process screws improves efficiency nearly seven times, saves nearly half of the metal, and reduces costs by nearly one-half compared with using automatic lathes. The six-axis semi-automatic vertical lathe successfully trial-manufactured this year only requires manual labor to put the parts on the chuck during production, and other work (including clamping the parts to releasing the parts after processing) can be fully automated. In mass production, one such lathe is equivalent to fifteen to twenty ordinary lathes. The high-voltage, high-temperature double extraction steam turbine of 25,000 kW successfully trial-manufactured by the motor industry department is specially used for equipping cogeneration power plants. One such equipment can extract steam for heating that can provide winter heating for more than 500,000 square meters of buildings, and the extracted steam for production can be used for the production of four to five machinery manufacturing plants with a scale of 5,000 people. Because the steam extracted for heating is steam that has already done part of the work in the turbine, the thermal efficiency of the entire thermal system is greatly improved. Compared with decentralized boiler rooms, its thermal efficiency can be increased by more than 10%, thus greatly saving coal.

　　Precision and Cutting-Edge New Products Such as Optical Coordinate Boring Machines and Electric Pulse Machining Machine Tools
　　This year, various mechanical industry departments have also successfully trial-manufactured precision and cutting-edge products such as precision optical coordinate boring machines, electric pulse machining machine tools, one-hundred-thousandth electric vacuum balances, ultra-high-pressure ethylene compressors, 865 kVA choke magnetic amplifiers, and Hongqi brand high-end sedans. Coordinate boring machines are mainly used to process holes in precision parts such as drilling dies and boring dies, and can also be used for scribing and measuring. The boring machine made this year has two characteristics compared with the precision coordinate boring machine successfully trial-manufactured last year: one is that the worktable area is large, and the other is that the longitudinal movement of the worktable uses a threaded mirror shaft and optical device to operate, so that the accuracy will not be affected by screw wear. Electric pulse machining machine tools are a type of electric machining machine tool, mainly used to process and repair forging dies. Using this machine tool can shorten working hours and reduce manual labor for fitters. Using it to process the shift fork forging die for tractor plants takes less than four hours, while using a milling machine takes sixteen hours. The electric vacuum balance is an electrically controlled measuring and analyzing instrument. In scientific research, certain substances that must be studied in a vacuum or in a specified gas must be precisely measured and analyzed using it. The highly precise ultra-high-pressure ethylene compressor successfully trial-manufactured this year reaches a pressure of 1,500 atmospheres, while the highest pressure of compression equipment produced in China in the past was only 220 atmospheres. This equipment is an important equipment for the production of polyethylene in the chemical industry.

　　The great leap forward in the technical level of China's mechanical industry is a victory under the leadership of the Party in conscientiously implementing the general line of socialist construction, and it is also the result of the vast number of workers and masses overcoming difficulties in every possible way in the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement. For example, when the furnace is small and the parts are large, and one furnace of steel is not enough, the workers and masses adopted the experience of "teapot boiling pig head" created in 1958, or used multiple packages for simultaneous pouring. In order to shorten the production cycle, they widely used carbon dioxide water glass quick-drying sand and the mud-type casting method inherited from our ancestors; in cutting, in order to solve the shortage of large processing tools and save working hours, many factories adopted methods such as "building block" machine tools, "combined" machine tools, and "ant colonies"; in order to save metal and improve work efficiency, the motor industry changed to die-casting and cold-rolling processes for manufacturing turbine blades, and so on. In the process of manufacturing large complete sets of equipment, the vast number of workers and staff demonstrated a communist spirit of mutual support and cooperation. In order to complete the task of equipment completion, many factories have taken measures in every possible way to ensure that large products are completed on schedule, with quality and quantity. In the process of trial-manufacturing these products, Soviet experts provided enthusiastic help and guidance. For example, when manufacturing many key components of the 72,500 kW water turbine, Soviet experts personally took action and often worked with the workers in the workshop.

　　机械工业向技术高峰跃进
    一年来试制成功许多高效率、大型、精密、尖端产品
    新华社30日讯　1959年，我国机械工业试制成功了许多高效率的、大型的、精密的和尖端的产品。
    大型冶金设备和发电设备
    试制成套大型设备，是机械工业今年向高大精尖跃进中一个显著特点。为了支援钢铁“元帅”和电力“先锋”，今年试制成功了许多成套的大型冶金设备和发电设备，其中有轧辊直径为八百毫米的大型型钢轧钢机，轧辊长度为二千三百毫米的中板轧钢机，轧管直径七十六毫米的无缝钢管轧钢机等设备；有有效容积一千五百一十三立方米的大型高炉设备和五百吨大型平炉的全套设备；有五万瓩氢冷却汽轮发电机及与之配套的高压中压汽轮机和电站锅炉，它所发出的电力可供二百五十万人口的城市照明用；有七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机组，这套机组比1951年我国开始生产的水轮发电机组的单机容量提高了九十倍以上，它所发出的电力足够拥有三百五十万左右人口的大城市照明。此外还有相应的大型输变电设备，其中最大的二百二十千伏、六万千伏安电力变压器，可供大型电站向三百公里以外的地区输电用。为了加工重型设备，机床工业部门今年也试制成功一批大机床。武汉重型机床厂试制的五米立式车床，可以加工高两米、直径五米、重量三十五吨的工件。上述这些产品，除了一千五百一十三立方米大型高炉的部分设备和七万二千五百瓩水轮发电机曾在1958年生产过以外，其余产品都是今年试制成功的。这些产品都具有体积大、配套复杂的特点，例如七万二千五百瓩水轮发电机组总重量达一千吨，高二十米，相当于普通楼房五层楼高，水轮机“转子”的大轴，要两个人手拉手才能合抱起来；五米立车总重量达六十八吨，共有大小零件二千五百多种、一万多件。今年生产这些大型机器，由于采用了先进科学成就，在结构上进行了许多改革，因之比我国现在已有的同规格设备有许多改进。例如八百毫米的轧钢机全套设备重量只有六千多吨，比我国现有的同规格轧机重量减轻了很多，此外还在轧辊颈部做了加强处理，因而可以承受较大的压下量，多出钢材；五万瓩氢冷却汽轮机采用了氢气冷却，比过去采用空气冷却缩小了发电机体积，并为今后发展更大容量的发电设备开辟了道路。
    新的高效率的自动冷镦机和自动立式车床
    在制造高效率产品方面，今年机械工业也取得很大成就。已经试制成功并投入生产的就有十多种新的高效率自动冷镦机，这种机械的效率很高，而且可以节约很多金属，用它们加工螺钉，比用自动车床加工提高效率近七倍、节约金属近一半，降低成本近二分之一；今年试制成功的六轴半自动立式车床，生产时除把零件放到卡盘上需要人工外，其它工作（包括夹紧零件到加工后放松零件）可以全部自动进行，在大量生产中，一台这样的车床相当于普通车床十五—二十台；电机工业部门试制成功的高压高温双抽汽式二万五千瓩汽轮机，是专为装备供电兼供热的热电站用的，一台这样的设备抽出的采暖用蒸汽可供五十万平方米以上的建筑冬季采暖，抽出的生产用蒸汽可供四—五个五千人规模的机械制造厂生产之用，由于抽出供热的蒸汽都是已经在汽轮机中做过一部分功的蒸汽，从而就大大提高了整个热力系统的热效率，与分散的锅炉房比较，它的热效率可提高10％以上，因此可以大大节约用煤。
    光学座标镗床、电脉冲加工机床等精密和尖端新产品
    今年，各机械工业部门还试制成功了像精密光学座标镗床、电脉冲加工机床、十万分之一电动真空天平、超高压乙烯压缩机、八百六十五千伏安扼流磁放大器、红旗牌高级小轿车等等精密和尖端的产品。座标镗床主要用于加工钻模、镗模等精密零件上的孔，也可以用来划线和进行测量。今年制成的这台镗床比去年试制成功的精密座标镗床有两个特点，一是工作台面积大，一是工作台纵向移动利用带螺纹刻线的镜面轴及光学装置操纵，这样就不会因丝杠磨损影响精度。电脉冲加工机床是电加工机床的一种，主要用来加工和修复锻压模具，利用这种机床可以缩短工时、减轻钳工手工劳动，用它加工拖拉机厂用的拨叉锻模时间不到四小时，如果用铣床加工则要十六小时。电动真空天平是一架电动控制的衡量分析仪器，在科学研究中，某些必须在真空中或在规定的气体中进行研究的物质，就要用它来进行精密衡量分析。今年试制成功的高度精密的超高压乙烯压缩机，压力达到一千五百大气压，而过去我国生产的压缩设备，最高压力只达到二百二十个大气压。这台设备是化学工业中生产聚乙烯的重要设备。
    我国机械工业技术水平的大跃进，是在党的领导下认真贯彻社会主义建设总路线的胜利，也是广大职工群众在轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动中，千方百计克服困难的结果。例如炉子小，零件大，一炉钢水不够用，职工群众就采用1958年创造的“茶壶煮猪头”的经验、或用多包同时浇注，为了缩短生产周期，广泛运用了二氧化碳水玻璃快干型砂和我国祖传的泥型铸造方法；在切削方面，为了解决大型加工工具不足和节省工时，许多厂都采用了“积木”式机床、“组合”机床、“蚂蚁群”等办法；为了节约金属和提高工作效率，电机工业制造汽轮机叶片改用压铸和冷轧工艺等等。在制造大型成套设备过程中，广大职工发扬了互相支援，互相协作的共产主义风格。为了完成设备成套的任务，许多工厂都千方百计地采取措施保证大型产品按期、按质、按量完成任务。在试制这些产品过程中，苏联专家作了热情帮助和指导。例如制造七万二千五百瓩水轮机的许多关键部件时，苏联专家亲自动手，经常和工人们一起在车间里紧张工作。
