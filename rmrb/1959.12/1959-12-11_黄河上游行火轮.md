    Steamship Travels on the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River
    The first small freighter "Lanhang No. 101" made by Gansu Province, with a deadweight of 30 tons, was recently launched for a trial voyage on the Yellow River near Lanzhou.
    In the past, only sheepskin rafts and a small number of wooden rafts traveled on the Yellow River in Gansu Province, and the transportation volume was very small. The launching of this freighter marks the beginning of Gansu Province's further utilization of the Yellow River to develop shipping.

    黄河上游行火轮
    甘肃省制成的第一艘载重三十吨的小型货轮“兰航一○一号”，最近在兰州附近黄河下水试航。
    甘肃境内的黄河上，过去只有羊皮筏子和少量木筏往来，运量很小。这艘货轮的下水，标志着甘肃省开始进一步利用黄河发展航运。
