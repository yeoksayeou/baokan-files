    Commune Fishermen's Song
    Yi Sha
    Night
    Weaving nets
    A pair of nimble hands
    A bamboo shuttle, a pair of scissors
    Guiding that affectionate thread
    Linking so many hearts together
    Weave, weave
    The sky is about to break
    A row of towering masts
    Gazing at the morning's incoming tide
    In the distance, the rooster crows loudly
    The lights dim, the window paper turns white
    Young men clamor on the beach
    Dispelling the girls' night of hard work
    Weave, weave
    The sea laughs
    Giant waves raise their arms, beckoning
    The harbor echoes with conch shells…
    She weaves a net of harvest
    She weaves a net of love
    In the boiling sea
    Who knows how many treasures are hidden?
    Only the giant net woven by the commune
    Can embrace the entire sea

    Standing Watch for the Tide [Note]
    On the sea, the waves sparkle
    Like a flowing pool of mercury
    The young man stands watch, like
    A sentinel on duty
    The moonlight, like frost, congeals
    Around him, not a breath of wind
    His eyes, like swords, focus intently
    He hears the sound of fish shoals lapping
    Look, a red light rises on the mast
    Reporting "enemy activity" to the fleet
    The commune's fishing boats, ten thousand crossbows firing together
    Rush at high speed towards the surging fish shoals…
    To discover the traces of fish in the sea
    The young man has the eyes of a hunter
    To defend the motherland's sea frontier
    The young man has the eyes of a soldier

    [Note] "Standing watch for the tide" and "surging" are common terms used by fishermen in Zhoushan. When there is no wind at sea, someone on the boat takes turns on night watch, observing the surface of the sea, and if they discover a shoal of fish, they immediately take action, called "standing watch for the tide"; the time when the fish are most concentrated is called "surging."

    公社渔歌
    易莎
    夜织网一双双灵巧的手一根竹梭、一把剪刀牵引着那根多情的线把多少颗心联在一起了织呵、织呵天将破晓一排排林立的桅杆眺望着清晨的来潮远处雄鸡高唱灯光暗了、窗纸白了小伙子们在海滩喧闹赶走了姑娘们一夜辛劳织呵，织呵大海在笑巨浪扬起手臂相招渔港里响起了螺号……她织成一面丰收的网她织成一面爱情的网在沸腾的大海中谁知道藏着多少珍宝只有公社织成的巨网才能把整个大海拥抱
    站潮〔注〕大海上波光粼粼像流动着一滩水银小伙子洋面站潮像值更的一名水兵月光霜一般凝住了四周围没一丝儿风眼光剑一般凝住了他听见了鱼群喋浪的声音看呀，桅杆上升起红灯向船队报告着“敌情”公社的渔船万弩齐发高速扑向发涌的鱼群……为了发现大海的鱼踪小伙子有一双猎人的眼睛为了捍卫祖国的海防小伙子有一双战士的眼睛
    〔注〕站潮、发涌，都是舟山渔民常用的术语。海上无风时，船上晚间有人轮流值班，观察海面，发现鱼群，马上行动，叫作“站潮”；鱼儿最集中时叫作“发涌”。
