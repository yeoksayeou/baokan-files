Why Degint Cottonseeds?

What is Linters?

Cottonseeds have fibers of different lengths, most of which are long and neat. These are cotton fibers for textile use, usually called cotton; there are also shorter fibers, the length of which does not meet the requirements for textile use. The base of these fibers is thicker, the tip is sharper, and the color is also darker. This fiber is called linters, and its content is about one-third of the long fibers. During ginning, some of these linters are ginned down and mixed into the cotton, while most remain on the cottonseeds.

Uses of Linters

Linters have a wide range of uses, generally divided into three categories. The first category is used as chemical raw materials, which can be used to make rayon, artificial wool, tire cord fabric, film, nylon, celluloid, plastic, high-grade paper, artificial glass, as well as film and protective paint; the second category is used as military raw materials, which can be used to make smokeless gunpowder, explosives, etc.; the third category can be used to spin coarse yarn, weave flannel, make knitwear, as well as for clothing and bedding wadding, medicinal cotton, making ropes, lamp wicks, etc.

Linters also have a broad market in the international market. China began exporting linters in 1954, and it has now become one of the important export commodities.

Benefits of Deginting Cottonseeds

Deginting the cottonseeds is beneficial for oil extraction. If the linters on the cottonseeds are not removed, they will absorb oil and adhere to impurities during the shelling and pressing process, thus wasting oil. Undeginted cottonseeds generally produce about 0.5% less oil than deginted ones.

Using deginted cottonseeds as seeds can improve the germination rate, promote earlier germination, and reduce pests and diseases. After deginting, the fluff wrapped around the cottonseeds is gone, reducing the restriction on the cottonseeds, allowing the cottonseeds to directly contact the soil, easily absorb moisture, and promote germination, and they will germinate more evenly.

    为什么要剥短绒？
    什么叫短绒
    棉籽上有长短不同的纤维，其中大部分纤维长而整齐，这就是供纺织用的棉纤维，通常叫做棉花；还有较短的纤维，长度不合乎纺织用的要求，纤维的基部较粗，末梢较尖，色泽也较深，这种纤维称为短绒，含量约为长纤维的三分之一左右。在轧花时，这种短绒一部分被轧下而混入棉花中，大部分则保留在棉籽上。短绒的用途
    短绒的使用范围很广，一般说来可分三大类。第一类是作化工原料，可制人造丝、人造毛、汽车胎的帘子布、胶卷、尼龙、赛璐珞、塑料、高级纸、人造玻璃以及电影片、保面油漆等；第二类用作军工原料，可制无烟火药、炸药等；第三类可以纺粗纱，织绒布，制针织品，以及用作衣被棉絮、药用棉，制绳索、灯芯等。
    短绒在国际市场上也有广阔的销路。我国出口短绒开始于1954年，目前已经成为出口的重要物资之一。
      棉籽剥绒的好处
    剥绒后的棉籽，对榨油有好处。棉籽上的短绒如不剥去，在榨油过程中，脱壳压榨，要吸收油分，粘附杂质，因而浪费油料。未剥绒的棉籽比剥过绒的一般要少出油0.5％左右。
    用剥绒后的棉籽作种籽，可以提高发芽率，提早发芽，还能减少病虫害。剥绒后，缠在棉籽上的绒毛没有了，减少了对棉籽的束缚，可使棉籽直接接触土壤，容易吸收水分，促进发芽，而且整齐均匀。
