The Dalian Shipyard's tonnage of ships built exceeded the annual plan by a quarter.
The Shanxi and Henan Textile Machinery Factories Completed their tasks quickly, well, and economically.
The Fujian Agricultural Machinery Factory and the Kaifeng Machinery Factory Increased Production of Agricultural Machinery.

Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, December 27th. The Dalian Shipyard, an advanced collective that attended the National Congress of Heroes, after completing its annual total output value plan 33 days ahead of schedule, comprehensively completed all national plan targets for this year on the 23rd. The tonnage of ships built reached 128% of the plan, labor productivity reached 109.5% of the plan, and the cost of comparable products was reduced by 3.65% compared to the plan. The quality, variety, profits turned over to the state, anchor chain, and steel output all exceeded the national plan. Furthermore, it produced 1,500 kW steam turbines, coking nitrogen fertilizer, smelting equipment, as well as rolling mills, power station equipment, boilers, large oil tanks, and other important products totaling 345 items.

Anti-Rightist struggle, boosting morale, launching mass movements, and carrying out technological innovation are important reasons why this factory achieved continued leaps forward this year. In the first half of the year, the workers self-reliantly manufactured a large number of equipment and materials, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient equipment and raw materials. The factory's leading cadres, technicians, and workers combined forces to carry out technological transformation, marching towards "Sixteen-ization," increasing the factory's level of mechanization by 98%, saving 318 laborers, and reducing the physical labor of the workers. For example, the chemical rust removal project alone saved 80 laborers and increased efficiency tenfold. Due to the increased level of mechanization and the solution of equipment and raw material problems, a large rolling mill and twenty steam turbines were produced at high speed in five months and four months respectively this year. The construction cycle of the second 5,000-ton freighter manufactured this year was shortened by 72 days compared to the first.

According to Xinhua News Agency, by December 6th, the Shanxi Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory had completed 100% of its annual manufacturing tasks of worsted spinning machines and woolen spinning machines, with quality and quantity guaranteed. In addition to meeting the planned variety, output, and quality, the completion of other indicators was also very good. The total output value exceeded the plan by 0.86%, the cost was reduced by 0.5% compared to the plan, and labor productivity exceeded the plan by 19.2%.

This year, the factory manufactured a large number of worsted spinning machines and woolen spinning machines, supplying more than 100 textile factories in Xinjiang, Zhejiang, Jilin, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Sichuan provinces and autonomous regions.

This newspaper reports that the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory has comprehensively overfulfilled this year's national plan. As of December 20th, the total output value reached 164% of the plan, product output reached 144% of the plan, the quality of the machines leaving the factory was all qualified, labor productivity reached 162% of the plan, the cost was reduced by 7.54%, and the savings target reached 276% of the plan.

The factory's main products are cotton openers and cleaners, sizing machines, and other textile machinery. Since the beginning of this year, all factory employees have continued to leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. Especially in August and September, under the leadership of the factory's Party Committee, they conscientiously implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, fought against Rightism, and boosted morale, making the production level higher month by month. All factory employees have launched vigorous technical innovations around key production issues. By December 18th, the factory had implemented 11,630 innovation proposals, greatly improving production efficiency and saving the country 603 tons of steel and 362 tons of pig iron.

This newspaper reports that the Fujian Agricultural Machinery Factory, an advanced collective that attended the National Congress of Heroes, has comprehensively completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule. As of December 20th, the output value plan was overfulfilled by 12%, and the output of major products listed in the national plan, such as mine cars, gas stoves, and power threshers, was overfulfilled by 12% to 20%. The profit plan was overfulfilled by 33.3%, the total cost was reduced by 11.87%, the quality of major products was greatly improved, and the casting scrap rate was reduced by 3.07% compared with the same period last year. Safe production was also achieved, with no major casualties throughout the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou. The Kaifeng Machinery Factory has excellently completed this year's production plan. As of December 22nd, the total annual output value plan was completed by 171.98%. The output of various products was completed ahead of schedule or exceeded the plan, and the quality of the products was all qualified, strongly supporting agricultural mechanization.

This factory not only completed its annual plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it, but also promoted the spirit of communism, helping the Kaifeng Agricultural Machinery Factory process more than 50 gas engine oil shafts and other parts, supporting the production of its brother factory.

After this factory was selected as an advanced collective to attend the National Congress of Heroes, it adjusted unreasonable work procedures, improved more than 30 kinds of special tools, and strengthened machine maintenance and raw material supply, thereby ensuring the early completion of the annual plan.
