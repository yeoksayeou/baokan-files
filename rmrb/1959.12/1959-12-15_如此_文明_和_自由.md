    So "Civilized" and "Free"
    "The Conscience and Consciousness of the West"
    A Paris weekly recently published an open letter with the headline "The Conscience and Consciousness of the West," written by American "writer" Gerry Miller, appealing against the Norwegian court's verdict on his "work," "The Sexual Lure." The verdict stated that Miller was "an enemy of society and a corrupter of youth." This American "writer" said that his pornographic novel was written "in language that girls shouldn't know." However, he tried to prove that no matter how obscene the works written under his pen, he himself was an extremely upright person.
    What kind of person is this American "writer," who calls himself a "distinguished member of society"? In his autobiography, it is written: "I hate nature as much as I hate classical writers." "I have no interest in collective life." "I hope and believe that the entire civilized world will completely disappear from the earth within the next hundred years."
    In his letter, Miller also shamelessly developed his "moral relativism," saying: "We are all right and all wrong, depending on whether one adopts the point of view of a toad or the insight of an Olympian god." After saying such absurd things, Miller stated that he did not accept the views of the Olympian gods.
    So, an American writer who views the world from the perspective of a toad and writes pornographic novels that poison the minds of young people, actually represents "the conscience and consciousness of the West"!
    "Freedom of the Press" in Spain
    In Spain, there is rampant control over publications, news, and speech, with censorship of newspapers and books prevalent throughout the country.
    Spanish writers often face a common fate after submitting their works: receiving a "death sentence" rejection letter. Enclosed is a blank piece of paper with a single sentence: "Inappropriate," with no signature and never a seal. Thus, the book can never be published.
    Spanish book censorship starts from the author's studio and permeates into bookstore display windows. The government has specific orders: which books can be displayed in the windows, which can only be placed inside the bookstore, and which cannot be sold at all.
    In addition to banning publication, censors sometimes make extensive deletions. Balzac's complete works, in Spain, have been compressed into only two thin volumes!
    Newspapers are even more severely controlled. Under strict rule, the content of newspapers is so poor that it is sickening. Since Franco came to power, newspaper readership has decreased by 60%. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 如此“文明”和“自由”

    如此“文明”和“自由”
    “西方的意识和良心”
    巴黎的一家周刊最近以“西方的意识和良心”的大标题发表了美国“作家”格里·米勒的一封向挪威法官翻案的公开信，米勒反对挪威最高法院最近就他的“作品”“性的魅力”而作出的判决。判决书中指出，米勒是“社会的敌人和青年的腐蚀者”。这位美国“作家”说，他的黄色小说是“用姑娘们不该知道的语言”写成的作品。但是，他力图证明：不管从他的笔下写出了怎么猥亵的作品，他本人却是极为正派的人。
    这位自称为“社会杰出的成员”的美国“作家”到底是怎样的人呢？在他的自传中写着：“我厌恨自然就像我厌恨古典作家那样。”“我对集体生活毫无兴趣”“我希望并相信整个文明世界在最近的一百年内会完全从地球上消失”。
    米勒在信中还无耻地发挥他的“道德相对论”，他说：“我们所有的人都有错也都无错，这就看他是接受蛤蟆的观点还是奥林匹克天神的见解。”在说出了这样不伦不类的话以后，米勒表示他并没有接受奥林匹克天神的见解。
    用癞蛤蟆的观点来看世界并且写出了毒害青年心灵的黄色小说的美国作家，原来代表着“西方的意识和良心”哩！“出版自由”在西班牙
    在西班牙到处是对出版、新闻、言论的横蛮控制，报刊书籍检查遍布全国。
    西班牙的作家将他们的作品寄出去以后，经常会遭到共同的命运：收到一封“宣判死刑”的退稿信。信封内附着一张白纸，上面一句话：“不恰当”，既没有签名，更从不盖印章。于是，这一本书就再也没法出版了。
    西班牙的书刊检查是从作者的工作室开始，一直渗入到书店的陈列窗。政府有专门的命令：哪些书可以在橱窗里陈列，哪些只能放在书店内部，哪些干脆就不能出售。
    除了禁止出版外，检查官有时还做大量的删节。巴尔扎克的全集，在西班牙就被压缩到只有薄薄的两小本！
    报纸被管制得更惨。在严厉的统治下，报纸的内容贫乏得令人生厌。佛朗哥执政以来报纸的读者减少了60％。（新华社讯）　（附图片）
