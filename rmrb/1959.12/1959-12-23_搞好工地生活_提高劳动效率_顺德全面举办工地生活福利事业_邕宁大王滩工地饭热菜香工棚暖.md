　　Improve Construction Site Life, Increase Labor Efficiency
    Shunde Fully Develops Construction Site Welfare Programs
    Dawan Beach Construction Site in Yongning: Hot Food, Delicious Dishes, and Warm Sheds
    (Our Dispatch) Leaders at all levels in the Shunde area of ​​Guangdong's Fan-Shunde County are taking various measures to improve welfare work at construction sites during water conservancy construction.
    Currently, Shunde area has 1,088 canteens that, without wasting food or increasing food costs, are providing two dishes and a soup, hot food and delicious dishes, and diverse food options, along with sufficient tea at the construction sites. All 150 water conservancy construction sites in the region have established nurseries, kindergartens, medical stations, supply and marketing stations, barber shops, etc., to meet the daily needs of the masses in all aspects. In addition, field work sheds and rest areas have been set up for all forty key projects and more remote construction sites.
    In the early stages of the water conservancy construction movement, some construction site canteens experienced staggered meal times due to the large number of people eating, wasting a lot of time; some construction sites did not set up nurseries or kindergartens, and women spent most of their rest time bringing their children and breastfeeding; some construction site canteens were poorly run due to weak leadership and lack of tools, which affected the productive mood of the masses. After discovering these situations, the Fan-Shunde County Party Committee immediately required leaders at all levels to take the lead in establishing life welfare organizations at the construction site level, with dedicated personnel responsible for the lives of the migrant workers at each level.
    Ling Botang, Secretary of the County Party Committee, went deep into the construction site of the Bijiang Brigade of Beijiao Commune to visit the masses, listen to their opinions, and solve many life problems of the commune members. Without increasing food and vegetable costs, they provided two dishes and one soup per meal, with a variety of pastries for breakfast. The brigade also made different meals according to the different needs of the people, which the masses were very satisfied with, and generally reflected that they ate better than at home. The Commune Party Committee immediately and comprehensively promoted the experience of the Bijiang Brigade's cadres personally taking the lead in running life welfare programs well, held on-site meetings, and launched a large-scale debate on the issue of running life welfare programs well at the construction sites, criticizing the erroneous ideas of some cadres who did not care about the lives of the masses. Soon, all 217 canteens in the commune were rectified and improved, and all canteens opened on time in coordination with the commune members' labor and production hours, so that commune members could eat whenever they arrived after work.
    In the Shunde area, the life welfare work at the construction sites is getting better and better, and the production enthusiasm of the commune members is getting higher and higher, which has greatly improved labor efficiency.
    (Our Dispatch) The Dawan Beach construction site of the Fengting River Water Conservancy Project in Yongning County, Guangxi, is making every effort to ensure that migrant workers eat well, live comfortably, rest adequately, are healthy, and are full of energy, thus generally improving work efficiency and speeding up the progress of the project.
    "Make every effort under the existing conditions to improve the lives of migrant workers and ensure increased work efficiency!" This is the slogan put forward by the Dawan Beach Reservoir construction site Party Committee to the construction site logistics department. In August of this year, the construction site Party Committee transferred some migrant workers to reclaim 910 mu of wasteland around the reservoir, planting cabbage, radish, winter melon, and pumpkin; on the eve of construction, the construction site Party Committee organized a group of migrant workers to go up the mountains to cut wood, bamboo, and grass to build work sheds, and erect dry and warm elevated bunks. The method of making elevated bunks is to drive wooden stakes into the ground, use wood to build a bed frame, then weave a mattress out of branches or bamboo branches instead of a bed board, and then spread straw or thatch on top. This kind of elevated bunk is both strong and comfortable. After the start of construction, the construction site Party Committee transferred a large number of cadres and migrant workers to form a logistics team. A set of institutions was established from top to bottom, and dedicated personnel were appointed to manage life; the headquarters and various migrant worker groups also organized life management committees to handle daily life issues. In order to ensure self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat at the construction site, the entire construction site has raised 102 pigs, as well as a batch of chickens and ducks. There is a complete variety of vegetables, and one person can eat one to one and a half catties of vegetables a day. Canteens are equipped with warming boxes, and bathrooms have been built throughout the construction site.
    In order to enliven life at the construction site, the headquarters frequently shows movies; various migrant worker groups have also organized mountain song groups, held mountain song competitions, and amateur theater troupes.
    "Everything for high work efficiency!" Under this slogan, the personnel of each department of the logistics front have given full play to their enthusiasm and initiative, and are constantly thinking of ways and ideas to serve the migrant workers. The migrant workers in the vegetable group go to the construction site toilets in the middle of the night every day to pick up manure. In each canteen, the cooks are also making every effort to diversify the dishes and make them taste good under the existing conditions.
    Because life is well arranged, the migrant workers are strong, healthy, and happy, and work efficiency has been greatly improved. The more than 400 migrant workers of the Lingli regiment used to fill small mud baskets with soil, but now they use large mud baskets to load soil, with each cart carrying three to four hundred catties. The average daily work efficiency per person has increased from half a cubic meter to 1.7 or 1.8 cubic meters, an increase of more than two times. In the tense battle to block the diversion channel, the Liangqing regiment's migrant workers challenged each other. The entire regiment of more than 400 migrant workers initially averaged 2.8 cubic meters of earth dug per person per day, then rose to 3.1 and 3.4 cubic meters, breaking through the 3 cubic meter mark set by the construction site Party Committee.

　　搞好工地生活  提高劳动效率
    顺德全面举办工地生活福利事业
    邕宁大王滩工地饭热菜香工棚暖
    本报讯　广东番顺县顺德地区各级领导在水利建设中，采取各种措施，做好工地生活福利工作。
    目前，顺德地区一千零八十八个食堂，在不浪费粮食和不增加菜金的原则下，已经做到两菜一汤，饭热菜香，食品多样化，工地茶水充足。整个地区的一百五十个水利工地已经办起了托儿所、幼儿园、医疗站、供销站、理发所等，从各方面满足了群众的生活需要。此外，四十个重点工程和较远的工地，全部搭好了田间工棚和休息所。
    在水利建设运动初期，一部分工地食堂由于吃饭的人多，出现了轮班吃饭的现象，浪费了不少时间；有些工地的托儿所、幼儿园没有办起来，妇女早晚带小孩和喂奶，占去了大部分休息时间；一些工地食堂由于领导力量薄弱和工具缺乏，一直办得不好，这就影响了群众的生产情绪。番顺县委发现这些情况以后，立即要求各级领导干部挂帅，以工地为单位成立生活福利机构，层层有人专责专管民工生活。
    县委书记凌伯棠深入到北?公社碧江大队工地访问群众，听取群众意见，解决了许多社员生活中的问题，并且在不增加粮食和菜金的原则下，每餐做到两菜一汤，早餐糕点多种多样。这个大队还根据人们不同的需要，做出不同的饭菜，群众十分满意，普遍反映比在家里吃得还好。公社党委立即全面推广了碧江大队各级干部亲自动手办好生活福利的经验，召开了现场会议，开展了办好工地生活福利问题的大辩论，批判了一部分干部不关心群众生活的错误思想。不久，全社二百一十七个食堂都经过整顿和提高，所有食堂都配合社员劳动生产时间准时开饭，社员收工后随到随吃。
    顺德地区由于工地生活福利工作办得越来越好，社员生产热情越来越高涨，大大提高了劳动效率。
    本报讯　广西邕宁县凤亭河水利工程大王滩工地，在现有的条件下，想尽各种办法，使民工吃得好，住得舒适，休息充分，个个身体健康，情绪饱满，工效普遍提高，加快了工程进度。
    “在现有的条件下，想尽一切办法，搞好民工生活，保证提高工效！”这是大王滩水库工地党委给工地后勤部门提出的口号。今年8月，工地党委就抽调了部分民工，在水库周围开垦了九百一十亩荒地，种上了白菜、萝卜、冬瓜、南瓜；施工前夕，工地党委又组织了一批民工上山砍木、砍竹、割草，修建工棚，并架设干爽温暖的高铺。高铺的做法是：在地上打下木桩，用木料搭成床架，再用树枝或竹枝编成床垫代替床板，然后铺上稻草或茅草，这种高铺既坚牢又舒适。开工以后，工地党委抽调了大批干部和民工，组成一个后勤队伍。从上到下建立一套机构，确定专人负责管理生活；指挥部和各民工团又组织了生活管理委员会，处理日常生活问题。为了保证工地蔬菜和肉类自给，全工地已养一百零二头猪，以及一批鸡鸭。蔬菜品种齐全，一人一天可以吃到一斤到一斤半菜。食堂设有保暖箱，工地洗澡房也普遍建起来了。
    为了活跃工地生活，指挥部经常放映电影；各民工团还组织了山歌组，举办山歌比赛大会和余业剧团。
    “一切为了高工效！”后勤战线各部门的人员在这个口号下，都发挥了积极性和主动性，不断想办法、出主意为民工服务。蔬菜组的民工每天半夜就到工地厕所挑粪便了。在各个食堂里，炊事员也在现有的条件下，想尽各种办法，把菜做得多样化、味道好。
    由于生活安排得好，民工们身强体壮，精神愉快，工效大大提高。伶俐团四百多个民工，过去用小泥箕装土还没装满，现在改用大泥箕装土，一车就是三、四百斤，平均每人每日工效由以前的半方提高到一方七或一方八，提高了两倍多。在堵导流沟的紧张战斗中，良庆团民工互相挑战，全团四百多个民工，开始平均每人每日挖土二方八，接着上升到三方一、三方四，突破了工地党委提出的三方大关。（附图片）
