Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, December 27th: Fushun Cement Plant completed its annual cement production plan 17 days ahead of schedule. The total output value, labor productivity, and profits turned over to the state were completed 22 to 47 days ahead of the national plan. Costs were reduced by 2.1% compared to the plan, and the quality was 100% qualified.

　　Fushun Cement Plant was once rated as an advanced unit in the national cement enterprise competition in the second quarter. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers further put forward many rationalization proposals. After joint research by leading cadres, workers, and technicians, the proportioning method was changed to improve clinker quality. The advanced experience of "Three Bigs and One Fast" (big wind, big fire, big material, and fast rotation) of Benxi Cement Plant was studied and promoted. Although the shale mixture ratio was increased from 25% to 30%, high yield and high quality were still achieved. In October and November, there was an excellent situation of daily red, ten-day red, and overall red.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 27th: Huangshi City's Huaxin Cement Plant achieved an all-round success in production this year. As of the 23rd of this month, the output has exceeded the annual plan by 3.38%, the output value has exceeded by 9.23%, the labor productivity has exceeded by 10.61%, the profit has exceeded by 2.3%, the cost has been reduced by 1.2% compared to the plan, and the product quality is all qualified.

　　From the first quarter of this year, Huaxin Cement Plant adopted methods such as feeding the kiln tail, which greatly increased the clinker output of the cement kiln. Later, the factory leadership mobilized the masses to carry out a quality inspection, and adopted the method of grasping quality at all levels and everyone grasping quality, which improved the quality of clinker. After the output of the cement kiln was increased, the cement mill's frequent shutdowns and low output became a weak link. At this time, the factory leaders summarized a set of reasonable operation methods by planting experimental fields in the fine grinding workshop, which greatly reduced the temporary shutdown rate of the cement mill, thereby laying the foundation for completing the production plan.

　　抚顺华新两水泥厂全面告捷
    据新华社抚顺27日电　抚顺水泥厂提前十七天完成了全年水泥生产计划，总产值、劳动生产率、上缴利润提前二十二天到四十七天完成了国家计划，成本比计划降低2.1％，质量百分之百合格。
    抚顺水泥厂在第二季度曾经被评为全国水泥企业厂际竞赛的先进单位。党的八届八中全会后，职工们进一步提出了许多合理化建议。经过领导干部、工人和技术人员共同研究，改变配比方法，提高熟料质量，学习并推广了本溪水泥厂大风、大火、大料和快转的“三大一快”先进经验，虽然赤页岩混合比由25％提高到30％，仍旧实现了高产优质。10、11两月更出现了日日红、旬旬红、全面红的大好形势。
    据新华社武汉27日电　黄石市华新水泥厂今年生产取得了满堂红。到本月23日止，产量已超过年度计划3.38％，产值超过9.23％，劳动生产率超过10.61％，利润超过2.3％，成本比计划降低1.2％，产品质量全部合格。
    从今年第一季度起，华新水泥厂就采取窑尾喂料等方法，大大提高了水泥窑的熟料产量。后来，工厂领导方面又发动群众开展了质量大检查，并且采取层层抓质量、人人抓质量的办法，提高了熟料质量。在水泥窑的产量提高以后，水泥磨临时停工多、产量低，又成了薄弱环节。这时，厂领导干部通过在细磨车间种试验田，总结出一套合理的操作方法，大大降低了水泥磨临时停工率，从而为完成生产计划打下了基础。
