Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: TASS reported from Moscow: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs read out at a press conference on the 19th the reply from the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, to the West German Chancellor Adenauer's letter of August 27th regarding relations between the two countries. Khrushchev pointed out in his reply that Adenauer's letter gives some reason to believe that West Germany and the Soviet Union have no fundamental differences on the issue of peaceful coexistence between countries. He believes that this is of paramount importance, because it shows the possibility of eliminating the current friction between the Soviet Union and West Germany and arranging a relationship of trust and cooperation between them.

Khrushchev expressed his pleasure in his reply at Adenauer's interest in the issue of disarmament. At the same time, he pointed out that it is difficult to reconcile Adenauer's interest in disarmament with certain practical actions that have characterized the policy of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

In this regard, Khrushchev pointed to the following facts: arming the Bundeswehr with atomic weapons and rocket weapons; allowing the establishment of more and more foreign nuclear weapons and rocket weapons bases on West German territory; and the stubborn unwillingness of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to promote measures in Central Europe aimed at reducing the danger of concentrated armed forces and armaments and reducing the danger of nuclear war in this region.

Khrushchev drew Adenauer's attention to the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament under appropriate international supervision. He expressed his hope that the West German government would support this Soviet proposal.

Khrushchev also expressed his hope that the Federal Republic of Germany would reject nuclear armament in order to prove the peaceful intentions of the federal government.

The head of the Soviet government pointed out that Adenauer's letter gives the impression that Adenauer considers the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to be a minor matter. Khrushchev pointed out that during the recent Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany set up numerous obstacles to reaching an agreement on a peaceful resolution of the German issue and on negotiations between the two Germanys to eliminate the state of national division. This position is incomprehensible.

### 赫鲁晓夫复信阿登纳  西德应当拒绝原子武装

　　赫鲁晓夫复信阿登纳
    西德应当拒绝原子武装
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部19日在记者招待会上宣读了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对西德总理阿登纳就两国关系8月27日来信的复信。赫鲁晓夫在复信中指出，阿登纳的来信使人有某些理由认为，西德和苏联在各国和平共处的问题上没有原则上的分歧。他认为，这点具有头等意义，因为，从这里看到了消除苏联和西德之间当前的摩擦并且在它们之间安排信任与合作的关系的可能性。
    赫鲁晓夫在复信中对阿登纳对于裁军问题所表现的兴趣感到高兴。他同时指出，很难把阿登纳这种对裁军的兴趣同迄今一直是德意志联邦共和国政府的政策的特征的某些实际行动联系起来。
    在这一方面，赫鲁晓夫指出了这样一些事实：用原子武器和火箭武器武装联邦国防军；允许在西德领土上建立越来越多的外国核武器和火箭武器基地；德意志联邦共和国政府顽固地不愿意促进在中欧地区实现旨在减少武装力量与军备集中的危险、减少这一地区发生核战争危险的措施。
    赫鲁晓夫提请阿登纳注意苏联提出的关于在相应的国际监督下实行全面彻底裁军的建议。他表示希望西德政府支持苏联的这一建议。
    赫鲁晓夫还表示希望德意志联邦共和国拒绝原子武装，以证明联邦政府的和平意图。
    苏联政府首脑指出，阿登纳的来信使人产生这样一种印象，似乎阿登纳认为缔结对德和约是一件无关紧要的小事。赫鲁晓夫指出，在最近一次日内瓦外长会议期间，德意志联邦共和国代表团在和平解决德国问题和就两个德国举行谈判来消除国家分裂状态的问题达成协议方面设置了重重障碍，这种立场是令人难以理解的。
