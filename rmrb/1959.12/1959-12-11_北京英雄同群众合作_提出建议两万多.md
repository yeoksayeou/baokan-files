Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: The representatives from Beijing who attended the National Congress of Heroes have returned to their production posts and are actively participating in production, becoming the "locomotives" in the current technological innovation and technical revolution movement.

According to statistics from 143 representatives, they have put forward 1,596 innovation proposals since the closing of the National Congress of Heroes, of which 440 have been implemented. In addition, they have proposed more than 22,000 suggestions together with the masses. These innovation proposals have played a significant role in promoting production and improving work efficiency. After the advanced collective, the converter steelmaking plant of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, carried out large-scale technological innovation, the converter utilization coefficient has reached the national advanced level, and the daily steel production level reached 570 tons in November, an increase of 7.5% compared with the daily production level in October. Hu Sibei, an advanced producer at Guanghua Wood Factory, immediately formed a communist collaboration team with engineers and outstanding red banner bearers from various workshops after returning to the factory, becoming the backbone of the factory's technical revolution movement. They go wherever there are difficulties to help. His ideal of using hydraulic power to peel tree bark has been successfully tested. Chen Fa, an old worker at Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, put forward seven technical innovation proposals after returning to the factory. He also repeatedly told the workers to continuously innovate. He himself studied even harder and created a cylinder surface grinding machine, which increased efficiency four to five times.

The representatives deeply realized the truth that "one flower does not make a spring, a hundred flowers in bloom make a spring," and they have put in tremendous labor in realizing the work of turning advanced levels into social levels. They have become the core of the advanced experience promotion team, their footprints have spread to many factories, allowing the seeds of advancement to blossom everywhere. Ni Zhifu of Yongding Machinery Factory helped workers in more than 7,000 factories across the city learn the "Ni Zhifu drill bit" day and night. Yu Chunhe of the Second Construction Company actively introduced the advanced experience of Yang Changshi's ladle-type ash spreader from construction workers in Hunan Province. After promotion, the work efficiency of many construction sites has increased by more than 20%.

In the process of enthusiastically helping others, the representatives have been more humbly learning from the masses. The drivers of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau recently helped a backward crew. During the technical performance with the train, they found that this crew did a very good job of draining water on curves, and immediately learned from them, promoted their experience in their own group, and introduced it to other groups. Chen Suzhi of the Beijing Second Cotton Textile Factory took the initiative to sign sister contracts with weaving experts from other shifts. While enthusiastically helping others, she learned from others' strengths. Now her number of looms she watches has increased from 32 to 36, and the product quality has reached 100%.

In order to learn from each other, encourage each other, and better play the role of advanced producers, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions held a forum for representatives from the city who attended the National Congress of Heroes on December 8. At the meeting, the representatives expressed their determination to work hard in December, better complete this year's tasks, and prepare for continued leaps forward next year. (Attached pictures)

    北京英雄同群众合作　提出建议两万多
    据新华社10日讯　北京市出席全国群英会的代表们回到生产岗位以后，积极参加生产，成为当前技术革新技术革命运动中的“火车头”。
    据在一百四十三名代表中的统计，他们在群英会闭幕以后，先后提出了一千五百九十六项革新建议，其中有四百四十项建议已经实现；此外还和群众一起提出了两万二千多项建议。这些革新建议对推动生产、提高工作效率起了很大的作用。先进集体石景山钢铁公司转炉炼钢厂大搞技术革新后，转炉利用系数已经达到全国先进水平，钢的日产水平11月份达到五百七十吨，比10月份的日产水平提高了7.5％。光华木材厂先进生产者胡四辈回厂后，立即和工程师及各车间优秀红旗手组成了共产主义协作队，成为工厂技术革命运动中的骨干力量，哪里有困难，他们就到哪里帮助。他的用水力剥树皮的理想已经试验成功。长辛店机车车辆工厂老工人陈发回厂后，提出了七项技术革新建议；他还反复告诉工人们要不断革新。他自己更加刻苦钻研，创造的汽缸净面研磨机，提高效率四到五倍。
    代表们深深体会到“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春”的真理，他们在实现把先进水平变成社会水平的工作中，付出了巨大的劳动。他们成为先进经验推广队的核心，足迹踏遍了许多工厂，让先进种子遍地开花。永定机械厂倪志福夜以继日地帮助全市七千多个工厂的工人学会了“倪志福钻头”。第二建筑公司于春和积极介绍湖南省建筑工人杨长诗瓢式铺灰器的先进经验，推广后的许多工地工作效率已提高20％以上。
  在热情帮助别人的过程中，代表们更加虚心地向群众学习。北京铁路局丰台机务段“毛泽东号”机车包乘组司机最近帮助一个后进车组，在跟车进行技术表演当中，发现这个车组的弯道放水做得很好，立刻向他们学习，把他们的经验在本组推广，并且向别组介绍。北京第二棉纺织厂陈素芝主动和别班的织布能手订立姊妹合同，她一面热情帮助别人，一面学习别人的长处，现在她织布看台数已经从三十二台提高到三十六台，并且产品质量达到了百分之百。
    为了互相学习互相鼓舞，更好地发挥先进生产者的作用，北京市总工会在12月8日召开了全市出席全国群英会代表的座谈会。会上，代表们表示决心大干12月，更好地完成今年任务，为明年继续跃进做好准备。（附图片）
