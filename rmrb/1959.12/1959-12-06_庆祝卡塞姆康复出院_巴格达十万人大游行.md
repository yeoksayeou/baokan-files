    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 4th: Today's parade in Baghdad celebrating Prime Minister Qasim's recovery and good health became a demonstration of the Iraqi people's national unity.
    This parade, approved by the military governor, was the first parade held since the celebration of the Iraqi July 14th Revolution, with more than 100,000 people from all walks of life participating.
  　The People's Court contingent, led by Colonel Mahdawi and Majid Amin, walked at the head of the parade. Almost all social and professional groups (including the Baghdad Chamber of Commerce, the General Federation of Iraqi Industries, and many sports clubs) participated in the parade. Despite the decision of the executive committee of the Lawyers Association not to participate in the parade, more than two hundred patriotic lawyers walked hand in hand with people from other groups.
    The procession started from Liberation Square, passed through Rashid Street, and then passed in front of the Ministry of Defense. Prime Minister Qasim appeared more than once on the specially built balcony in front of the Ministry of Defense to salute the parading masses.
    An airplane flew overhead and distributed leaflets printed by the Iraqi Aviation Association to the jubilant masses. Peace doves were released in the parade.
    Today, Prime Minister Qasim received a large number of telegrams congratulating him on his recovery and discharge from the hospital, including congratulatory messages from senior army officers, cabinet ministers, newspaper editorial departments, and social and people's organizations.

    庆祝卡塞姆康复出院
    巴格达十万人大游行
    新华社巴格达4日电　今天在这里举行的庆祝卡塞姆总理恢复健康的游行成为一次表示伊拉克人民民族团结的示威。
    这次由军事长官批准的游行是伊拉克7月14日革命庆典后举行的第一次游行，十万多各界人民参加了这次游行。
  　以马赫达维上校和马吉德·阿明为首的人民法庭的队伍走在游行队伍的前面。差不多所有社会团体和职业团体（其中包括巴格达商会、伊拉克工业总联合会以及许多体育俱乐部）都参加了这次游行。尽管律师联合会执行委员会作出了不参加这次游行的决定，仍有两百多名爱国律师手携手地同其他团体的人民一起游行。
    队伍从解放广场出发，穿过拉希德街，然后经过国防部前面。卡塞姆总理不止一次地出现在国防部前面特地建造的阳台上，向游行群众致意。
    一架飞机飞临上空，向兴高采烈的群众散发了伊拉克航空协会印发的传单。游行队伍中放出了和平鸽。
    今天卡塞姆总理收到大量祝贺他康复出院的电报，其中包括陆军高级军官、内阁部长、各报编辑部以及社会和人民团体的贺电。
