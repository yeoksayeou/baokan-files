　　The Bankruptcy of the Congo "Election" Farce
　　Ke Yuelin
    The farce of the so-called Congo "local elections" directed by the Belgian colonial authorities opened on December 20th. The Belgian ruling clique has been trying its best to exaggerate the "significance" of this "election," saying that "the moment to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Congo residents has arrived." The Belgian Minister of Colonial Affairs, De Schrijver, has also frequently released information about "shortening the transition period" and allowing the Congo to "gain independence in 1960," attempting to lure the Congo people into participating in the election. However, contrary to the wishes of the colonialists, this election has been widely boycotted by the Congo people. According to Western news agencies, in the capital Leopoldville, more than 70% of the residents responded to the call of the ABAKO party and did not participate in the voting. In the port of Matadi, only 3% of the 12,000 residents registered to participate in the "election" under coercion. In some areas, the colonial authorities have not yet found candidates, and the "election" has had to be postponed repeatedly. As the Belgian Communist Party's organ "Red Flag" recently pointed out in an editorial, this "local election" held in the Congo is "a painful failure" for the Belgian colonialists, and it shows "the decisive influence of the parties supporting immediate independence."
    The so-called "local elections" recently held in the Congo are just one step in the Congo's "phased independence" plan formulated by the Belgian government. The so-called "phased independence" plan is a deceptive trick used by the Belgian colonial authorities to consolidate their colonial rule. According to the provisions of this plan, "elections" for territorial and municipal councils are held first in the Congo, then provincial "councils" are produced, and finally a national "Senate," "House of Representatives," and a so-called government governing the entire Congo are established. However, despite the Belgian government's loud calls for granting democratic rights to the Congo people, a large part of the members of these so-called "local councils" must be appointed by the Belgian government. More importantly, the councils and governments are just empty shells and have no real power, with national power in the hands of the governor appointed by the Belgian King. Regarding this obvious fraud, Patrice Lumumba, chairman of the Congolese National Movement, once pointed out sharply that participating in this election would mean subjecting the Congolese to another twenty years of colonial enslavement.
    The Belgian colonialists have ruled the Congo for decades. Why are they proposing a "phased independence" plan now? This is because the old set of colonial rule methods no longer works in the Congo. Since the large-scale anti-colonialist struggle broke out in Leopoldville in January this year, the Congo people's movement for national independence has been surging forward with great momentum, causing the Belgian colonialists to be overwhelmed and exhausted. It is in this situation that the colonialists cunningly expressed their intention to hold "elections" and "reforms" in the Congo, attempting to use these empty promises to paralyze the Congo people's fighting spirit, thereby maintaining their colonial interests in the Congo.
    In order to peddle this set of fake democracy, Belgian colonial officials flew from Brussels to Leopoldville one after another to win people's hearts. Belgian King Baudouin also hurriedly arrived in Stanleyville on the eve of the Congo's "local elections." In his radio address, he talked at length about how "the stage of mercifully summoning the Congo to independence has arrived." However, when the Congo people saw through the colonialists' tricks and expressed their boycott of the "election," the so-called "benevolent father" of the colony, who was full of benevolence and morality, suddenly became furious. In order to suppress the Congo people's resistance, the colonialists have recently repeatedly provoked disputes between the Lulua and Baluba tribes, and under the pretext of "maintaining law and order," they have armed and suppressed the Congo people who oppose the "election" fraud. At the end of October, the colonial military police persecuted the Congolese National Movement party, which boycotted the "election," and on November 1st, they unreasonably arrested the party leader, Lumumba. During the recent election, the leadership structure of the Lulua party was also severely damaged. Two local leaders of the Congolese National Movement and some Congo youths were also arrested and imprisoned on December 20th. Belgian Minister of Colonial Affairs, De Schrijver, blatantly threatened: "The authorities will ensure that order will be established everywhere in the coming months, which are of decisive significance to the Congo..." The Congo "must move towards independence in peace and discipline."
    This combination of soft and hard tactics by the Belgian colonial authorities cannot deceive or intimidate the Congo people. During the election, many plantation workers refused to work and demonstrated to the colonialists. In the Isangi area, about one hundred kilometers northwest of Stanleyville, the people rose up to resist the suppression of the colonial army and stabbed a soldier to death. Belgian King Baudouin, this time at the cost of "condescending" to come to the Congo, originally hoped that his "visit" would ensure that this "election" would proceed "orderly." However, the King's plan fell through. According to Reuters, in the Congo, in addition to a small group of Europeans who welcomed him, Africans expressed an "unusual welcome" to the Belgian King with protest demonstrations and slogans such as "Long live independence."
    In order to quickly end Belgian colonial rule and establish a government of their own, Congo's various political parties are further strengthening unity and fighting the colonialists unyieldingly. The conference of representatives of various political parties in the Congo, proposed by the ABAKO Party, the African Solidarity Party, and the Kalonji faction of the Congolese National Movement, successfully concluded in Gizenga on the evening of December 27. The resolution adopted by the conference called for immediate independence for the Congo and demanded that the Belgian government hold negotiations on the transfer of power. This fact fully demonstrates that what the Congo people want is genuine national independence, and they unanimously reject the deceptive schemes such as the so-called "local elections" and "phased independence" plotted by the Belgian government.
    Although the Belgian colonial authorities will continue to use various conspiracy methods to undermine the Congo people's national liberation movement in the future, the Congo people, who urgently demand to get rid of the colonialist yoke, are invincible. It can be predicted that the days when the colonialists can wantonly plunder and run rampant in the Congo will not be long!

　　刚果“选举”骗局的破产
　　柯月霖
    由比利时殖民当局导演的所谓刚果“地方选举”的丑剧已于12月20日开场。比利时统治集团竭力渲染这次“选举”的“意义”，说什么“满足刚果居民合法愿望的时刻已经到来”。比利时殖民事务大臣德舒里弗更不时放出“缩短过渡时期”和让刚果“在1960年获得独立”的空气，企图诱骗刚果人民参加选举。但是，与殖民主义者的愿望相反，这次选举遭到刚果人民的普遍抵制。据西方通讯社报道，在首府利奥波德维尔，有70％以上的居民响应阿巴科党的号召，没有参加投票。在马塔迪港的一万二千居民中，只有3％的人在胁迫下登记参加“选举”。有些地区，殖民当局至今尚未物色到候选人，“选举”不得不一再延期。正如比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”最近在社论中指出的，这次在刚果举行的“地方选举”，对比利时殖民主义者说来，是“一个痛苦的失败”，它显示了“支持立即独立的各政党的决定性影响”。
    最近在刚果举行的所谓“地方选举”不过是比利时政府制订的刚果“分阶段独立”计划的一个步骤。所谓“分阶段独立”计划，是比利时殖民当局为了巩固其殖民统治而施展的欺骗伎俩。按照这个计划的规定，首先在刚果举行领地和市镇议会“选举”，然后产生省“议会”，最后建立全国性的“参议院”、“众议院”和所谓管辖刚果全境的政府。但是，尽管比利时政府高喊给予刚果人民民主权利，这些所谓“地方议会”的很大一部分议员却必须由比利时政府指定。更重要的是，议会和政府徒具虚名，并无实际权力，国家大权操于由比利时国王指派的总督之手。对于这种明显的骗局，刚果民族运动党主席卢蒙巴曾经一针见血地指出：参加这种选举，也就是让刚果人再遭受二十年的殖民奴役。
    比利时殖民者统治刚果已经有几十年了，为什么偏偏现在提出“分阶段独立”方案呢？这是因为旧的一套殖民统治的办法在刚果已经行不通了。自从今年1月在利奥波德维尔爆发了大规模的反殖民主义斗争以来，刚果人民争取民族独立的运动波涛汹涌地向前发展，声势浩大，使比利时殖民者焦头烂额，疲于奔命。正是在这样的形势下，殖民主义者狡诈地表示要在刚果举行“选举”和“改革”，企图用这种空洞的诺言来麻痹刚果人民的斗志，从而保持住自己在刚果的殖民利益。
    为了兜售这一套假民主的货色，比利时殖民官员一个接着一个地从布鲁塞尔飞到了利奥波德维尔去拢络人心。比利时国王博杜安在刚果举行“地方选举”的前夕也匆匆抵达斯坦利维尔。他在广播演说中大谈什么“仁慈地召唤刚果走向独立的阶段已经来到”。但是，当刚果人民识破殖民主义者的诡计、对“选举”表示抵制的时候，满嘴仁义道德的所谓殖民地的“慈父”顿时恼羞成怒了。为了压制刚果人民的反抗，殖民主义者最近连续几次挑拨路路阿和巴卢巴两个部族间的纠纷，并借口“维持治安”，武装镇压反对“选举”骗局的刚果人民。10月底，殖民军警又对抵制“选举”的刚果民族运动党进行迫害，并于11月1日无理逮捕这个党的领袖卢蒙巴。在最近选举期间，路路阿党的领导机构也遭受到严重破坏。刚果民族运动党的两位地方领袖和一些刚果青年，也在12月20日被逮捕入狱。比利时殖民事务大臣德舒里弗公然恫吓说：“当局将保证对刚果具有决定意义的未来几月中将到处建立秩序……”，刚果“必须在平静和纪律中走向独立”。
    比利时殖民当局这种软硬兼施的手法，是骗不了也是吓不倒刚果人民的。在选举期间，许多种植园工人拒绝工作，向殖民者示威。在离开斯坦利维尔西北约一百公里的伊桑吉地区，人民群起反抗殖民军队的镇压，刺死了一名士兵。比利时国王博杜安这次不惜“屈尊”来到刚果，原来指望他的“访问”能使这次“选举”保证“有秩序地”进行。但是，这位国王的计划落空了。据路透社报道，在刚果，除了一小群欧洲人对他表示欢迎以外，非洲人以抗议示威和高呼“独立万岁”等的口号对这位比利时国王表示了“异样的迎接”。
    为了迅速结束比利时的殖民统治和建立刚果人自己的政府，刚果各个政党正在进一步加强团结，百折不挠地同殖民主义者进行斗争。由阿巴科党、非洲团结党和刚果民族运动党卡隆吉派建议召开的刚果各政党代表大会，已于12月27日晚上在吉赞图胜利闭幕。大会通过的决议号召争取刚果立即独立，并要求比利时政府就移交政权问题举行谈判。这个事实充分说明，刚果人民要求的是真正的民族独立，他们一致唾弃比利时政府阴谋策划的所谓“地方选举”和“分阶段独立”等欺骗方案。
    尽管比利时殖民当局今后还会施展各种阴谋手段破坏刚果人民的民族解放运动，但是，迫切要求摆脱殖民主义枷锁的刚果人民是不可战胜的。可以预料，殖民主义者在刚果恣意掠夺和横行霸道的日子将不会很长了！
