Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 27th. The Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant actively organized overhaul personnel to launch a red flag competition, successfully completing the plan for overhauling, medium repairs, minor repairs, inspections, precision inspections, cleaning, and oil changes for over 1,000 machine tools ahead of schedule. They realized the slogan of "No Sick Machine Tools for the New Year," and prepared fast horses and good equipment for a flying start to production next year.

In order to quickly complete the overhaul task, the factory's Party Committee actively organized overhaul personnel to launch a red flag competition, requiring them to complete the overhaul tasks on time or ahead of schedule and ensure the quality of the overhaul. In the competition, the overhaul personnel displayed soaring enthusiasm, preparing tools and parts early, and supporting each other, greatly improving the efficiency of the overhaul. Some key equipment had very tight production tasks, leaving no time for overhauls. The workers then adopted rapid overhaul methods, understanding the equipment situation clearly in advance, preparing tools and parts to be replaced, and rushing to repair during downtime and shift changes of production workers. For some key equipment with larger overhaul volumes, a partial overhaul method was adopted, starting with the main parts and seizing every gap in time to overhaul part by part. In this way, the overhaul of key equipment was guaranteed according to plan, without affecting production. In solving the problem of spare parts for equipment overhaul, the factory also adopted a combination of professional overhaul workshops and production workshops, speeding up the overhaul and ensuring the quality of machine tool overhauls.

　　沈阳第二机床厂检修大竞赛
    提前完成一千多台机床检修
    新华社沈阳27日电　沈阳第二机床厂积极组织检修人员开展红旗竞赛，出色地提前完成了大修、中修、小修、检查、精检、清洗、换油一千多台机床的计划，实现了“带病机床不过年”的口号，为实现明年生产开门红，备好了快马良械。
    为了迅速完成检修任务，这个厂党委会积极组织检修人员展开红旗竞赛，要求做到按时或提前完成检修任务，保证检修质量。在竞赛中，检修人员发挥了冲天干劲，及早准备工具、零件，互相支援，大大提高了检修效率。有些关键设备生产任务很紧，抽不出时间检修。工人们就采取快速检修方法，事前把设备情况了解清楚，把工具和要更换的部件准备好，利用卡活时间和生产工人换班时间抢修。一些检修量较大的关键设备，则采取分部检修办法，从主要部分开始，抓紧每个空隙时间，一部分一部分地检修。这样，既保证了关键设备按照计划检修，又不影响生产。在解决设备检修备件问题上，这个厂还采取了专业检修车间和生产车间相结合的办法，加快了检修速度，并且保证了机床检修质量。
