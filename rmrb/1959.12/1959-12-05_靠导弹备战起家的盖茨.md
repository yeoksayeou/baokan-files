Gates Made His Fortune Preparing for War with Missiles

    The U.S. Pentagon recently changed masters again: Thomas Gates Jr. replaced McElroy as Secretary of Defense.

    Gates' promotion has been quite rapid. He only joined the Navy's intelligence work in 1942. During World War II, he became a Navy captain by virtue of his ability to collect intelligence in several important battles. In 1953, he leaped to become Under Secretary of the Navy. Only four years later, he was promoted to Secretary of the Navy. This May, after the death of Quarles, he became Deputy Secretary of Defense, and American newspapers predicted that he would succeed McElroy as Secretary of Defense.

    Why was Gates able to rise so quickly?

    First, it is inseparable from his relationship with monopoly capital groups. Gates was born into a wealthy banking and industrial capitalist family. As early as 1928, when he was only twenty-two years old, he joined the well-funded Philadelphia Drexel Investment Company and became a partner in the company in 1940. From 1946 to 1948, he successively served as a director and deputy general manager of Bevin Coal Company. But this was just a stepping stone for Gates to be selected by the monopoly capital group to enter the Pentagon. People can see how close his relationship with the monopoly capital group is from Gates' "achievements" in "coordinating" the three services' competition for missile orders.

    The monopoly capital groups behind the U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force have been fighting fiercely for missile appropriations, which has greatly hindered the U.S.'s missile development plan. During his tenure as Under Secretary of the Navy, Gates became an "arbitrator in the tense competition" between the three services. According to Gates, the death of Deputy Secretary of Defense Quarles this May was an "unfortunate event" caused by "this highly stressful public service life." But Quarles' "misfortune" became Gates' good fortune. Gates took his place and "gained a high reputation" in continuing his "arbitration" work. In order to buy time and concentrate on developing missiles, the monopoly capital group made it a certainty to promote Gates to Secretary of Defense.

    Not only that, Gates himself is a missile "expert" and a warmonger who is enthusiastic about developing missiles. During his tenure as Under Secretary and Secretary of the Navy, he began to equip the Navy with missiles, prepared for "limited wars," and did his best. He also participated in the drafting of the so-called "mixed" strategy defense plan, jointly drafted by Eisenhower, McElroy, Anderson and others, which focused on the development of "Atlas" missiles, and was an active supporter of this plan.

    Therefore, just as the U.S. ruling group is talking about peace on the one hand and stepping up the development of missiles on the other, Gates' ascension to the post of Secretary of Defense is perfectly timed.

### 靠导弹备战起家的盖茨

    靠导弹备战起家的盖茨
    美国五角大楼最近又换了主人：小托马斯·盖茨代替麦克耳罗伊担任国防部长。
    盖茨的提升是够快的了。他在1942年才参加海军的情报工作。第二次世界大战期间，他靠在几次重要战役中搜集情报的本领当了海军上校。1953年他就一跃而为海军部副部长。不过四年，他又升任海军部部长。今年5月，他继死去的卡利斯作了国防部副部长之后，美国报纸就纷纷预测他将接替麦克耳罗伊的国防部长职务。
    盖茨为什么能够这样飞黄腾达呢？
    首先，这同他与垄断资本集团的关系分不开。盖茨出身于一个富豪的银行兼工业资本家的豪门。早在1928年，他还只有二十二岁的时候，就进了资力雄厚的费城德莱克塞尔投资公司，并在1940年成为该公司的合伙人。1946至1948年他又先后当了比文煤炭公司的董事和副总经理。但这不过是盖茨被垄断资本集团选进五角大楼的垫脚石。人们从盖茨“协调”三军争夺导弹定单的“业绩”中，可以看出他同垄断资本集团的关系是如何密切。
    美国海、陆、空三军背后的垄断资本集团之间，为争夺导弹拨款，一直闹得不可开交，大大妨碍了美国发展导弹的计划。盖茨在担任海军部副部长期间就成了三军之间
  “紧张的竞争中的仲裁人”。据盖茨说，今年5月，国防部副部长卡利斯之死，是“这种高度紧张的公职生活”造成的“不幸事件”。但卡利斯的“不幸”却成了盖茨的幸事。盖茨接了他的位子，并使他在继续进行“仲裁”工作中，“获得了很高的名声。”垄断资本集团为了争取时间，集中力量发展导弹，把盖茨擢升为国防部长就成了定局了。
    不仅如此，盖茨本人就是一个导弹“专家”，也是热衷于发展导弹的好战分子。在他任海军部副部长和部长期间，就开始为海军装备导弹、准备“有限战争”，卖尽了力气。他还参加过由艾森豪威尔、麦克耳罗伊、安德逊等人联合起草的以发展“阿特拉斯”导弹为主的所谓“混合”战略的国防计划的起草工作，并且是这一计划的积极支持者。
    因此，正当目前美国统治集团一面侈谈和平，一面加紧发展导弹的时候，盖茨登上国防部长的宝座，就完全是适逢时会的了。
