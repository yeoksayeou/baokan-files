    "The First German Drama of Political Tendency"
    Sun Kunrong
    "Intrigue and Love" (1784), the early work of the great German poet and playwright Schiller, praised by Engels as "the first German drama of political tendency," is being staged by the China Youth Art Theatre to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Schiller's birth. This is of great significance for us to understand this great writer and his works more profoundly, and to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and German people.
    "Intrigue and Love" profoundly reflects the class contradictions in German society in the 18th century. At that time, the morality and self-esteem of the emerging bourgeoisie in German society were incompatible with the feudal ruling class of Germany at that time. Schiller's "Intrigue and Love" positively depicts the life and thoughts of the middle class, full of hatred for the brutal, greedy, and licentious feudal autocracy, and makes a bold challenge and impact on the corrupt and decadent old society.
    This tragedy reflects the essence of two social classes—the court aristocratic class and the bourgeois class—through the depiction of a love story between a young nobleman and a commoner girl. The young nobleman, Major Ferdinand, is the son of Chancellor Walter. He falls in love with Louise, the music teacher's daughter, and wants to marry her despite the strict class barriers. His father wants to gain greater power and tries to get Ferdinand to marry Lady Milford, the Duke's mistress. Love and intrigue unfold in this complex relationship. As a result, Ferdinand poisons Louise, and then poisons himself. Before her death, Louise tells the truth about the conspiracy, but it is too late. Love and hatred disappear with death, and the conspirator is plunged into the abyss of eternal shame.
    Schiller boldly and frankly stated in this play: "The events in the play take place in a certain court in Germany." Because the autocracy and violence, cunning conspiracies and legal licentiousness, and even the sinful rule of arbitrarily infringing on human rights and freedoms in the Duchy of Württemberg, where Schiller spent his youth, made him brave enough to undertake the role of "a great spiritual representative in an era when the rising German bourgeoisie sought democracy, freedom, national unity, and independence" (Engels). Because it is based on reality, the script so deeply touches people's hearts and truthfully reflects the social life of Germany at that time.
    The original script of "Intrigue and Love" has five acts, each with five or six scenes at the fewest and nine at the most; the entire performance takes more than five hours. In this performance by the China Youth Art Theatre, the director made bold deletions, shortening the time to about three hours. From the effect of the performance, the director's deletion was successful, making the contradictions in the play more concentrated, the struggle more acute, and the atmosphere more tense, and thus more able to capture the audience's psychology. The contradiction unfolds in the first scene. Due to the inequality of the two classes, a sword hangs over the love between Ferdinand and Louise—the class boundary. Although Louise confessed to Ferdinand: "You have thrown a spark into my peaceful heart, and this fire will never go out," she already anticipated in her heart what kind of results social tradition and class prejudice would bring her. Louise loves Ferdinand, and the deeper she loves, the more her heart is filled with contradictions and pain. Her humble background, her father's opposition, the chancellor's power, and the inequality between people torment her noble and pure soul. She cannot suppress the fear in her heart, and she does not have the courage to charge forward and fight against the existing social order, so she has to let fate take its course. Although Ferdinand was born into the aristocracy, he reflected the ideas of the emerging bourgeoisie. He was full of hatred and indignation for the bloody autocratic system of the feudal tyrants at that time, and yearned for a life of equality and freedom for all. This was very rare and precious at the time. He loathed the decadent aristocratic social life, and in thought and action, he ran counter to the "promising" future his father had envisioned for him, and to a certain extent, he dared to launch fierce challenges to the feudal autocratic system and its representatives. This rebellious spirit was of great progressive significance. However, due to the limitations of his class, he could not understand Louise's soul, nor could he appreciate the contradictory psychology of a simple and pure bourgeois girl; and more importantly, he had his own weaknesses—suspicion and jealousy, which were precisely the cracks that his father used for his conspiracy. Louise's weakness exceeded love, and Ferdinand's jealousy was as strong as his love, making their love inevitably end in tragedy in the face of cunning enemies. The death of this pair of lovers is not only the result of the conflict between their emotions and ideals and the sinful old world; moreover, this death also has its internal causes, that is, although they are determined to break with false social traditions and class prejudices, they are still inevitably infected by the influence of the times and cannot break through the barriers of class. In "Intrigue and Love," Schiller, a great writer with revolutionary ideas, once again profoundly revealed the dual character of the bourgeoisie through the fate of these two young protagonists. In our view today, it has even more new educational significance. Wang Chong, who plays Ferdinand, and Liu Yansheng, who plays Louise, have more completely shaped the images of those naive young people who had new perspectives on the surrounding reality at that time.
    Musician Miller is a stubborn petty bourgeois, and he fully embodies the duality of the bourgeois class at that time. On the one hand, he is upright, proud, and has self-respect; on the other hand, he has a fear of the rulers. To successfully play this role, the actor must deeply grasp these two emotions. However, in the entire performance, the actor seems to have excessively expressed the upright side of the character, while ignoring the fearful side. This will create the illusion for the audience that the German bourgeois class was already very strong and brave at that time.
    Schiller used his great genius to shape a gallery of aristocratic figures in the court and their loyal lackeys. Jiang Zulin, the actor who plays Chancellor Walter, played well this old, cunning, and ambitious representative of the ruling class with typical significance. He and that sinister and vicious secretary, Wurm, get together and can do anything bad.
    The complexity of character is a characteristic shared by almost all the main characters in this play. Lei Ping, who plays the English woman Lady Milford, more profoundly expressed the psychological changes of the character; due to the social position of this character in the play, the actor needs to embody many complex and contradictory characteristics and emotions.
    Director Comrade Zhou Lai successfully handled this script, which embodies the highest peak of Schiller's early works, so that the audience can clearly see the social life of Germany in the 18th century and the spiritual outlook and ideological outlook of people of all classes from the stage. Through their every move, the brutality and greed of the feudal ruling class are deeply exposed on the stage, predicting that the demise and death of this class is also an inevitable result.

    “第一部德国的政治倾向的戏剧”
    孙坤荣
    被恩格斯誉为“第一部德国的政治倾向的戏剧”——德国伟大诗人和剧作家席勒青年时代的作品“阴谋与爱情”（1784年），由中国青年艺术剧院在纪念席勒诞辰二百周年的时候上演了。这对我们更加深刻地了解这位伟大作家及其作品，以及加强中德两国人民之间的友谊都有巨大的意义。
    “阴谋与爱情”深刻地反映了十八世纪德国社会的阶级矛盾。当时德国社会中新兴的资产阶级的道德和自我尊严是同当时德国的封建统治阶级格格不入的。席勒的“阴谋与爱情”就是正面地写出了市民阶级的生活和思想，充满了对于残暴、贪婪、荒淫无耻的封建专制的憎恨，对腐朽堕落的旧社会进行了大胆的挑战和冲击。
    这个悲剧通过对一个贵族青年和一个平民少女恋爱故事的描写，反映了两个社会阶级——宫廷贵族阶级和市民阶级的本质。贵族青年斐迪南少校是宰相瓦尔特的儿子，他爱上了音乐师的女儿露伊斯，并且不顾阶级壁垒的森严，要和她结婚。他的父亲想获得更大的权势，却设法使斐迪南和公爵的情妇米尔佛特夫人结婚。爱情和阴谋也就在这样错综复杂的关系中展开。结果斐迪南把露伊斯毒死，自己也服了毒。临死前露伊斯才把阴谋的真情说出来，但时间已晚，爱情和仇恨随着死亡一起消逝，阴谋的制造者也陷于永远耻辱的深渊。
    席勒在这个剧中大胆地率直声言：“剧中事件发生于德意志某一宫廷中”。因为席勒度过青年时代的符腾堡公国中的一切专横和暴力，狡诈的阴谋和合法的荒淫，乃至随意侵犯人权自由的罪恶统治，使他勇于承担起“处在上升的德国资产阶级寻求民主、自由、民族统一和独立的时代中的一个伟大的精神代表”（恩格斯）。正因为取材于现实，所以剧本那样深刻地打动人心，真实地反映了德国当时的社会生活。
    “阴谋与爱情”的原剧本有五幕，每幕少则五、六场，多则九场；全部演出时间需要五个多小时。这次中国青年艺术剧院的演出，导演作了大胆的删节，把时间缩短为三小时左右。从演出的效果来看，导演的删节是成功的，使剧中的矛盾显得更集中，斗争显得更尖锐，气氛显得更紧张，因此也就更加能够抓住观众的心理。矛盾在第一场就展开了。由于两个阶级的不平等，斐迪南和露伊斯的爱情中间，悬挂着一柄利剑——阶级界限。尽管露伊斯向斐迪南表白：“你已经把火种扔进我平静的心房，这把火是永远不会熄灭的。”但她的内心已预感到社会传统和阶级偏见会给她带来怎么样的结果。露伊斯热爱着斐迪南，她爱得愈深，内心也就愈加充满矛盾和痛苦。自己出身的低微，父亲的反对，宰相的权势，以及人与人之间的不平等，在折磨着她高尚而纯洁的心灵。她不能抑制心中的恐惧，她更没有冲锋陷阵的勇气同现存的社会秩序进行斗争，最后只好听任命运的摆布。斐迪南虽出身于贵族，但他反映了新兴资产阶级的思想。他对当时的封建暴君的血腥专制制度，充满了憎恨与忿怒，向往着人与人平等自由的生活。这在当时是十分难得而可贵的。他厌恶腐朽的贵族社会生活，无论思想上和行动上都同父亲为他设想的“飞黄腾达”的前程背道而驰，并且在一定程度上还勇于向封建专制制度及其代表人物进行激烈的挑战，这种叛逆精神是有很大的进步意义的。但由于阶级的局限性，他不能了解露伊斯的心灵，不能体会朴素纯洁的市民少女的矛盾心理；而更重要的，他有自己的弱点——多疑和嫉妒，这正是他父亲使用阴谋的缝隙。露伊斯的软弱超过爱情，斐迪南的嫉妒和爱情一样强烈，使他们的恋爱在狡诈的敌人面前必然以悲剧作为收场。这一对恋人的死，不仅是他们的感情和理想与罪恶的旧世界冲突的结果；而且，这死还有其内在原因，这就是尽管他们决心与虚伪的社会传统和阶级偏见断绝关系，但终不免感染了时代的影响，不能突破阶级的藩篱。具有革命思想的伟大作家席勒在“阴谋与爱情”中，通过这两个青年主人公的命运，又一次深刻地揭示了资产阶级的双重性格。在我们今天看来，更有它新的教育意义。饰斐迪南的王憧和饰露伊斯的刘燕生较完整地塑造了当时那些对周围现实有了新观点的天真青年的形象。
    音乐师米勒是一个刚愎倔强的小市民，在他身上也充分地体现了当时市民阶级的两重性，一方面耿直、骄傲，有自我尊严；另一方面对统治者又怀有畏惧心理。要成功地演好这个角色，演员必须深刻地掌握这两种情绪。但是在整个演出中，演员似乎比较过分地表现了角色的耿直的一面，而忽略了畏惧的一面。这样就会给观众造成一种错觉，好像德国的市民阶级那时已经非常坚强和勇敢了。
    席勒以他的伟大天才塑造了宫廷中贵族阶级及其忠实奴才的群像。饰宰相瓦尔特的演员姜祖麟较好地扮演了这个老奸巨滑，野心勃勃的具有典型意义的统治阶级的当权代表人物。他和那个阴险狠毒的秘书伍尔牧搞在一起，是什么坏事都做得出来的。
    性格的复杂性，几乎是这个剧中一切主要人物都具有的特点。饰英国女子米尔佛特夫人的雷平较深刻地表现了人物的心理变化；由于这个人物在剧中所处的社会地位，演员需要体现许多复杂矛盾的性格和情感。
    导演周来同志成功地处理了这个体现了席勒青年时代作品最高峰的剧本，使观众能从舞台上，鲜明地看到十八世纪德国社会生活和各阶层人物的精神面貌和思想面貌。通过他们的一举一动，在舞台上深刻地暴露了封建统治阶级的残暴、贪婪，预告了这个阶级的没落死亡也是一种必然的结果。（附图片）
