Automatic Hatch Covers Save Labor

Shanghai Maritime Bureau employees, in coordination with workers from the Hongxiangxing Shipyard, recently successfully installed wooden automatic hatch covers on the "Peace Thirty-Nine" ship. This reduces the labor intensity for workers and greatly shortens the time required to open and close the hatch covers.

Manually opening and closing hatch covers on ocean-going ships is a heavy physical labor. Especially on ships with large hatches like the "Peace Thirty-Nine," the four hatches have more than six hundred hatch cover boards, each weighing eighty jin, and the beams weigh forty-nine tons in total. It takes at least three hours for the entire ship's sixteen sailors to operate them. Now, with these wooden automatic hatch covers, each operation only takes three to four minutes.

    自动舱盖省劲多
    上海海运局职工最近在鸿翔兴船厂工人的配合下，在和平三十九号轮上安装成功木质自动舱盖，减轻了工人劳动强度，大大缩短了开关舱盖的时间。
    在海轮上用人力开关舱盖，是一种繁重的体力劳动。特别像和平三十九号这类大舱口的船舶，四个舱口共有六百多块舱盖板，每块重八十斤，连同大梁共重四十九吨，全船十六名水手一起操作，至少也得要三个小时。现在有了这种木质自动舱盖，操作一次，只要三、四分钟。
