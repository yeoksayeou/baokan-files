　　A Red Banner of Anhui Secondary Schools
　　——Visiting Sucheng No. 1 Middle School, Anhui Province
　　*Our Correspondent in Anhui Province*
    Sucheng No. 1 Middle School in Anhui Province has made a leap in the quality of teaching due to the correct implementation of the Party's education policy. This year, the school's high school graduates' performance in college entrance examinations ranks first in the province.

    Hard Work in Teaching
    Teachers' work is like gardeners diligently watering flowers and trees. The teachers of Sucheng No. 1 Middle School have put in hard work to teach students well.

    Take lesson preparation as an example. Teachers not only prepare lessons more than three weeks in advance, but also came up with a "personal preparation, collective preparation by teachers of the same subject and grade, and collective preparation by teachers of the same subject in each grade" three-step lesson preparation method. On the basis of personal preparation, teachers wrote preliminary teaching plans; then they jointly studied teaching objectives, progress, and key and difficult points of teaching materials, teaching methods, etc. among teachers of the same subject and grade; if problems could not be solved, they could also be studied among teachers of the same subject in each grade, helping each other and exchanging experiences. By doing this, lesson preparation is better than before. They also pay special attention to studying students' age characteristics, personality characteristics, ideological situation, and the general level, characteristics, and shortcomings of knowledge quality in a certain subject, and then prepare lessons in a targeted manner according to these situations, so that students can better accept new knowledge.

    Students reflect that in the past, teachers just poured knowledge down; now, teachers really teach people. Teachers know which students are poor in their studies and pay special attention to them when asking questions and tutoring. "Teaching books but not people, teaching in the classroom but not outside the classroom"—these bourgeois educational viewpoints have disappeared in this school.

    After a class, the teacher always asks the students for their opinions: Do you all understand what was taught in this class? During early and late self-study, teachers go to the classroom to see if students have any difficulties in doing exercises, and take the initiative to tutor students with poor grades. During free reading time on Saturday afternoons, teachers tutor students with poor grades or those who have missed many classes. They go over the key and difficult points of this week's courses again, or summarize, review, and consolidate them. This is called "weekend cleanup" in Sucheng No. 1 Middle School.

    In Sucheng No. 1 Middle School, grading homework is a good opportunity to tutor students. Teachers always try to call students to their side, grading while explaining the mistakes to the students. Teachers also use criticism in compositions to help students. When grading math and science homework, there are also sectional comments and overall comments.

    Cultivating Well-Rounded Individuals
    After education and productive labor are combined, students' ideological outlook and academic performance have made leaps and bounds, and the situation has been completely renewed. The senior high school class 2 (3), which originally had the worst grades in the entire grade, has jumped to the first place in the entire grade since the second half of last year.

    After participating in the Great Steel Smelting Movement last year, Sucheng No. 1 Middle School, in addition to participating in short-distance transportation and rushing to harvest and plant in support of industrial and agricultural production, also established a regular labor system and had its own production base: small machinery factories, woodworking factories, flour mills, and soap factories; it also opened up its own small farm and breeding farm.

    Students' participation in productive labor has cultivated their love for labor and the working people. In the past, some students were afraid to walk on the street if they got their clothes dirty during labor. Now, they are covered in mud and called "little mud plasterers," but they feel honored instead.

    Arranging appropriate labor while learning book knowledge not only does not affect the quality of teaching, but on the contrary, makes the quality of teaching leap forward. Some courses, due to being taught in conjunction with productive labor, allow students to acquire direct practical knowledge, and they are not easy to forget after learning them. When testing physics last semester, there was a question about finding the speed and input power of a lathe, which involved many physics concepts. The students had interned in the machinery factory, and the teacher had taught them on site, so most students answered this question correctly. In other subjects such as Chinese, politics, history, and geography, the test papers are full of enthusiastic political feelings, and the test scores are also very good. Participating in labor has expanded the students' knowledge fields. When high school students were learning the "casting" lesson, they could not remember the casting process, tool names, etc., by rote memorization; after performing casting operations in the machinery factory, everyone happily said that if this lesson were tested, they would not have to review the book to be confident.

    Through labor, nearly seven hundred students in the school have mastered preliminary skills in forging, woodworking, casting, lathe work, iron smelting, etc. Students reflect that this learning method is good, they are interested in learning and using what they learn, they remember what they have done firmly, and their thoughts and bodies are trained at the same time.

    Consistently Emphasizing Ideological Education
    The Party organization of Sucheng No. 1 Middle School, closely relying on the leadership of the county party committee, resolutely carried out struggles against various bourgeois educational ideas in the process of implementing the Party's educational policy, and thoroughly criticized tendencies such as "teachers running the school" and "teaching books but not people" that were divorced from the Party's leadership and politics. Then, a democratic life system was established in the teaching and research groups of each subject, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out regularly, and political theory was organized to improve the ideological awareness of teachers and staff. After each major task is deployed by the school, teachers are mobilized to discuss and implement it, and inspections and summaries are carried out at any time. There are two comprehensive summaries of work each semester. Through inspections and summaries of work, experiences are drawn, teachers and staff who are ideologically progressive and work actively are commended, and people with errors and shortcomings are helped to improve. In addition to undertaking necessary teaching activities, the Party member principal and director of teaching are responsible for leading the teaching and research groups, and by helping the teaching and research groups to study their work and listening to teachers' lectures, they discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the school has organized teachers to participate in physical labor such as steel smelting and rushing to harvest and plant. Because the school party organization has consistently strengthened political and ideological education, the ideological progress of teachers and staff has also been rapid, and a new atmosphere of unity, mutual assistance, and concentration on teaching has emerged. For example, young teacher Wu Yongheng was impatient in teaching in the past, and students had opinions. After the Party's education and the help of the teaching and research group, the transformation was very fast. Now, he not only prepares lessons thoroughly and deeply, but also often takes the initiative to tutor students in his spare time, and grades students' homework in a timely and meticulous manner, which the students are very touched by.

    The school party organization also attaches great importance to strengthening political and ideological education for students. The Party member principal and director of teaching not only often give students political current affairs reports, but also specifically help class teachers and the Communist Youth League to thoroughly and meticulously grasp the students' ideological situation and carry out regular ideological education work. Students' consciousness in learning is getting higher and higher, and many students have raised the quality of their studies to the height of "whether or not to accelerate the construction of socialism." They are not satisfied with their academic performance and demand to improve it further. (Attached picture)

　　安徽中等学校的一面红旗
　　——访安徽省宿城一中
　　本报驻安徽记者
    安徽省宿城一中，由于正确贯彻了党的教育方针，教学质量有了飞跃的进步。今年，这个学校高中毕业生投考高等院、校的成绩，跃居全省第一。
    辛勤的教学工作
    教师的工作像是园丁辛勤灌溉花木。宿城一中的教师们，为了教好学生，付出了辛勤的劳动。
    就拿备课来讲，教师不但都超前备好三周以上的课程，而且还想出了“个人自备，同学科、同年级教师集体备，各年级同学科教师集体备”的备课三步骤。教师们在个人自备的基础上，写出了初步的教学计划；再在同科、同级教师中共同研究教学目的、进度和教材重点、难点、教学方法等；有问题解决不了还可以在各年级同科教师中研究，互相帮助，交流经验。这样做，备课比过去备得更好了。他们还特别注意研究学生的年龄特征、个性特点、思想情况和在某一学科的知识质量上的一般程度、特点和缺陷等，然后根据这些情况有的放矢地来备课，使学生能够更好地接受新知识。
    学生们反映，过去上课，老师只是把知识往下灌；现在，老师可真是教到人了。有哪些同学功课差，老师都知道，提问、辅导时，都特别注意。“教书不教人、教堂上不教堂下”，这些资产阶级教育观点在这个学校灭了迹。
    一节课完了，教师临走总要征求学生的意见：这堂课讲的都懂了没有。早、晚自修时，教师们就到教室来看学生做习题有困难没有，主动找成绩较差的学生来辅导。到了星期六下午自由阅读的时间，教师又为成绩差的、缺课较多的学生补课。把这一周课程中的重点、难点再讲一遍，或者概括复习、巩固一番，这在宿城一中叫做“周末大扫除”。
    在宿城一中，批改作业是辅导学生的好机会。教师总想办法把学生叫到身边，一面批改，一面把错的地方讲给学生听。在作文本上教师还用批评语的办法，帮助学生。在批改数理化作业时，也都有分段评语、总评语。
    培养全面发展的人
    当教育和生产劳动结合以后，学生的思想面貌、学习成绩飞跃进展，局面更焕然一新。原来全级成绩最差的高三（2），从去年下半年开始就跃居全级第一。
    宿城一中在去年参加了大炼钢铁运动以后，除参加了支援工农业生产的短途运输、抢收抢种等劳动以外，还建立了经常性的劳动制度，有了自己的生产基地：小型的机械厂、木工厂、面粉厂和肥皂厂；开辟了自己的小农场、饲养场。
    学生参加生产劳动，培养了他们热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民的思想。过去，有的学生劳动时弄脏了衣服就不敢在街上走，现在弄了一身泥巴，被人称为“小泥水匠”，反觉得光荣。
    在学习书本知识的同时，安排适当的劳动，不但丝毫不影响教学质量，相反地使教学质量有了突飞猛进。有些课程由于结合生产劳动来教，学生获得了直接实践的知识，学了就不容易忘记。上学期考物理学的时候，有一个关于求车床转速和输入功率的试题，涉及较多的物理学概念。学生们在机械厂里进行过实习，教师在现场教过，所以大多数学生都答对了这一题。其他如语文、政治、史地等学科的试卷中，都流露着热烈的政治感情，考试成绩也很好。参加劳动，使学生们的知识领域扩大了。高三学生在学习“铸造”一课时，对铸造的工序、工具名称等等，死记硬背也记不熟；在机械厂进行了铸造的操作以后，大家都高兴地说，要是考这一课，不再翻书复习也有把握了。
    通过劳动，全校有近七百个学生分别掌握了锻工、木工、铸造、车工、炼铁等的初步技术。学生们反映这种学习办法好，学了就用兴趣高，做过的事记得牢，思想、身体也同时得到了锻炼。
    一贯重视思想教育
    宿城一中的党组织，紧密依靠县委的领导，在贯彻党的教育方针的过程中，坚决同各种资产阶级教育思想开展了斗争，先后对“教师办校”、“教书不教人”等脱离党的领导、脱离政治的倾向进行了彻底的批判。接着又在各学科的教研组建立了民主生活制度，经常开展批评和自我批评，并组织政治理论的学习，提高教职员的思想觉悟。学校当每一项主要工作布置以后，都发动教师进行讨论贯彻，并随时检查总结。每学期工作的全面总结都有两次，通过工作的检查总结，吸取经验，表扬思想进步、工作积极的教职员，帮助有错误和缺点的人改进。党员校长、教导主任，除担任必要的教学活动以外，分工负责领导各教研组，通过帮助教研组研究工作和听教师讲课，发现问题，及时解决。在去年大跃进以来，学校组织教师参加了大炼钢铁和抢收抢种等体力劳动。由于学校党组织一贯加强了政治思想教育工作，教职员的思想进步也很快，出现了团结互助、一心搞好教学的新气象。如青年教师吴永恒，过去教课不耐心，学生有意见。经过党的教育和教研组的帮助，转变很快。现在他不但课备得熟、备得深，并经常在课余时间主动去辅导学生，批改学生的作业既及时又细致，学生都很受感动。
    学校党组织也非常重视对学生加强政治思想教育。党员校长和教导主任不但经常给学生作政治时事报告，而且具体帮助班主任、共青团深入细致地掌握学生思想情况，开展经常性的思想教育工作。学生学习的自觉性越来越高，很多学生把学习的好坏提到“要不要加速建设社会主义”的高度来认识，对自己的学习成绩不满足，要求提高再提高。（附图片）
