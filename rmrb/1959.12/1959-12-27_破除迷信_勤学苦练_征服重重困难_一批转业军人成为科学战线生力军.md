　　Breaking Superstition, Diligent Study and Hard Practice, Overcoming Multiple Difficulties
    A Batch of Transferred Soldiers Become a New Force on the Science Front
    (Our report) In the Great Leap Forward, a large number of new young people appeared in the laboratories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with yellow trouser legs showing under their snow-white work clothes. They were transferred soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. They handed over the guns guarding the motherland to other comrades, and came to this place with "primary school" and "junior high school" education levels. After only about a year, this group of former young soldiers has become a new force in scientific undertakings. Some have already made innovations and creations in their work, improving work efficiency; others have written work reports and summaries, earning praise from veteran scientists. Many have mastered the scientific experiments and technical businesses they are responsible for and are already familiar with many complex and precise scientific instruments.
    In October, the trainees of the Second Research Office of the Institute of Atomic Energy held a scientific and technological achievement report meeting. The authors of the reports were mostly young soldiers who had been transferred about a year ago. Four demobilized soldiers who reported on vacuum technology in the past only had a primary school education, but now they can independently conduct vacuum tests on machine parts and solve air leakage problems. One of the trainees named Zhang Baojian discovered in the process of inflation tests that the small leak bubbles were different from the bubbles formed by unclean surfaces. Although this discovery is not very profound in science, it is of great significance to the inflation test work, and can quickly check the cause and save time.
    Communist Party member Chen Xiumao was a young farmer before joining the army and an artilleryman in the army. He only had a primary school education and knew nothing about scientific research. However, after nine months at the Institute of Metal Research, he was able to write a work report and read it out at a "Youth Science and Technology Report Meeting" with hundreds of people. The scientist Guo Kexin said at the meeting: "I listened to four wonderful reports, especially the report by Comrade Chen Xiumao, which was even more touching. It is very difficult for a PLA soldier who only had a primary school education when he came to the research institute to write a qualified work report. His report has a preface at the beginning, a conclusion at the end, and an analysis in the middle; and he solved the difficulty of not being able to process data." Most of the hundreds of transferred soldiers assigned to the Institute of Geology have been able to draw profile maps and identify specimens in field work; those who are engaged in chemical analysis have mastered the analysis methods of some elements; and a few have been able to lead small teams in field work.
    Li Zuoliang, a transferred soldier from the Spectroscopy Research Office of the Institute of Physics, once accepted the task of installing a power supply for a "photomultiplier tube," which was completely unfamiliar to him. He even lacked the most basic knowledge about this work, but he was strong-willed, humbly asked for advice, and worked hard, and finally overcame the difficulties and completed the task. Some transferred soldiers in the Spectroscopy Office have been rated as "pace-setters" or received other forms of commendation due to the rapid improvement in their business. In addition to actively completing tasks, they also study culture seriously, without resting even on Sundays. Some people learned the basic chemical symbols in only two weeks.
    There is a research group in the Institute of Organic Chemistry, the vast majority of whose members are young transferred soldiers. In just a few months, they not only mastered general operations, but also put forward 27 technical improvement suggestions, which played an important role in the group's early completion of work tasks. They were therefore commended by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.
    The road from a revolutionary soldier who has not studied for a few years to a scientific and technological worker who can master a scientific and technological business is difficult and tortuous. A gunner or machine gunner will never be so handy when he first encounters delicate and tender scientific experimental instruments. Some people are saddened by breaking two test tubes in a row, and some are annoyed by damaging glass instruments. However, the biggest difficulty is not these, but the limitation of cultural level. When they first came, some basic symbols and formulas in science and technology seemed like heavenly books to them. However, under the unreserved cultivation of the party organization and the help and guidance of scientists, they studied hard, broke superstitions, used their brains, and gave play to the courage and vigor of the people's soldiers, and finally overcame the difficulty of learning culture, rapidly improved their cultural level, and mastered their business.

### 破除迷信  勤学苦练  征服重重困难  一批转业军人成为科学战线生力军

　　破除迷信  勤学苦练  征服重重困难
    一批转业军人成为科学战线生力军
    本报讯　在大跃进中，中国科学院各研究所的试验室里，出现了一大批新来的年轻人，雪白的工作服下面，露着黄色的裤脚管。他们是转业的解放军。他们把守卫祖国的枪枝移交给了别的伙伴，带着“小学”“初中”的学历来到这个地方。仅仅经过了一年左右的时间，这批过去的青年军人已经成了科学事业中的新生力量，有的人在工作中已经有了革新和创造，提高了工作的效率；有的写出了工作报告和总结，博得了老科学家的好评。很多人都掌握了自己分担的科学实验和技术性的业务，对于许多复杂精细的科学仪器，已经熟悉了。
    10月里，原子能研究所第二研究室的见习员举行了一次科学技术成果报告会。报告的作者大多数是一年前转业来的青年军人。报告真空技术的四个复员军人过去都只有高小文化程度，现在已能独立进行机器部件的真空试验，解决漏气问题。其中一位叫张宝简的见习员，在打气试验过程中，发现了小漏气水泡与表面不清洁形成的水泡有差别。他这个发现在科学上虽然不算怎么高深，但是对于打气试验这个工作却很有意义，能够迅速检查出原因，节省时间。
    共产党员陈秀卯在参军前是一个青年农民，在部队里是一个炮兵，只有高小程度，根本不懂什么科学研究。但是，他到金属研究所九个月以后，已能写出工作报告，并在几百人的“青年科学技术报告会”上宣读。科学家郭可信在会上说：“我听了四个精彩的报告，特别是陈秀卯同志的，更使人感动，一个来到研究所时只有高小程度的解放军军人，就能写出合乎规格的工作报告，这是非常不易的事，他的报告开头有序言，最后有结论，中间有分析；并且解决了不会处理数据的困难。”分配到地质研究所的几百名转业军人，在野外工作中大多已能绘制剖面图和识别标本；担任化学分析工作的人已掌握了一些元素的分析方法；少数人已能带领小队进行野外工作。
    物理研究所光谱研究室的转业军人李佐良有一次接受了为“光电倍加管”装电源的任务，这对于他是完全陌生的，他甚至缺乏最起码的关于这项工作的知识，但是他意志坚强、虚心请教、勤学苦钻，终于克服了困难，完成了任务。光谱室有的转业军人由于业务上的迅速提高而被评为“标兵”或受到其他方式的表扬。他们平时除了积极完成任务以外，都认真学习文化，连星期天也不休息。有的人只用两星期的时间就学会了化学基本符号。
    有机化学研究所有一个研究组，极大部分成员是青年转业军人，他们在短短几个月中不但掌握了一般操作，而且提出了二十七项技术改进的建议，对这个组提前完成工作任务起了重要作用，他们因此得到了共青团上海市委的表扬。
    从一个没有念过几年书的革命军人到能够掌握一项科学技术业务的科学技术工作者，其间的道路是艰难崎岖的。一个炮手或机枪手，一开始碰到精巧柔嫩的科学实验器皿决不会那么得心应手。有的人为了接连打破了两个试管而伤心，有的为了碰坏了玻璃仪器而烦恼。然而最大的困难不是这些，而是文化水平的限制。刚来时，科学技术上的一些起码的符号和公式在他们看来真像天书一般。但是，在党组织的不遗余力的培养和科学家的帮助指导下，他们勤学苦炼，破除迷信，开动脑筋，发挥了人民战士的勇气和干劲，终于越过了学文化的难关，迅速地提高了文化水平，掌握了业务。（附图片）
