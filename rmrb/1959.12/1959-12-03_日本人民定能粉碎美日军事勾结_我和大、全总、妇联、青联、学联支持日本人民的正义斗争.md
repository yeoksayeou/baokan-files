Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd—The China Peace Committee today sent a telegram to the National Conference for Preventing the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," expressing support for the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and wishing the Japanese people new and greater achievements in the ninth unified national action.

The telegram stated that the eighth unified national action against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" held by people from all walks of life in Japan marks a further surge in the Japanese people's struggle, powerfully expressing their firm will to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and the Japan-U.S. military alliance. The Chinese people express their heartfelt respect to the Japanese people who are carrying out a heroic and tenacious struggle despite threats and obstruction, and express their great indignation at the Kishida government's suppression of the Japanese people and mass organizations.

The telegram stated that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are stepping up the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in order to strengthen the Japan-U.S. military alliance, revive Japanese militarism, antagonize China and the Soviet Union, expand into Southeast Asia, and plot new wars of aggression in the Far East. The Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is not only to defend Japan's national interests and security, but also plays a significant role in strengthening the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people have always been deeply concerned about and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Japanese people, and regard the development and victory of the Japanese people's struggle as an important contribution to the common cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

The telegram stated that we firmly believe that the heroic Japanese people, with the support of peace-loving people from all countries, will unite more closely, make persistent efforts, smash any conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries with full confidence, and achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd—The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), expressing support for the heroic struggle of Japanese workers and the Japanese people against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The telegram stated that we are excited to see that Japanese workers and people are waging an increasingly massive struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." We express our heartfelt respect for the heroic and united spirit demonstrated by Japanese workers and people in the eighth unified action against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The telegram stated that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, and opposing the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' intensified revival of Japanese militarism and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world are the common tasks of the Chinese and Japanese people. Chinese workers and the Chinese people have always regarded the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and further abolishing this treaty as their own struggle, and have consistently supported your just struggle.

The telegram stated that the Kishida government dispatched a large number of police on the 27th to carry out a bloody suppression of Japanese workers and people who were petitioning the Diet, illegally searched trade union offices, and conspired to carry out a new large-scale suppression of democratic organizations. We are extremely indignant about this and express our deep condolences to the injured workers.

The telegram concluded by saying that we firmly believe that the heroic Japanese workers and people will become stronger, unite as one, and persevere in the struggle to the end. Final victory will surely belong to the Japanese workers and people.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd—The All-China Women's Federation today sent a telegram to the Japanese Women's Organizations Liaison Council and the National Conference for Preventing the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," expressing support for the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The telegram stated that we are pleased to see that the struggle of the peace-loving Japanese people against the revision and demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is rising day by day. The Chinese people and women have always given sympathy and support to the just struggle of the Japanese people.

The telegram stated that we believe that the brave and strong Japanese people will never succumb to the Kishida government's adoption of fascist suppression policies, and will further strengthen unity and launch an indomitable struggle against the Kishida reactionary government's conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The telegram said, "Dear sisters! In your just struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, the entire Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world will always stand with you, and final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people."

The telegram concluded by expressing great indignation at the Kishida government's bloody suppression of the Japanese people and extending cordial condolences to the heroically struggling Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd—The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Japan Democratic Youth League and the Japan "Youth and Student Central Joint Struggle Conference for Preventing the Revision of the Security Treaty," expressing that Chinese youth and students fully support the just struggle of the Japanese people and young students against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The telegram stated that the eighth unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" held by the Japanese people and Japanese young students on November 27th throughout the country expressed the Japanese people's strong desire for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, and demonstrated the Japanese people's strong unity and great strength.

The telegram pointed out that now the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, regardless of the Japanese people's firm opposition, are attempting to forcibly sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in January next year to strengthen their oppression and plunder of the Japanese people and strengthen the open military alliance against China and the Soviet Union. It is very clear that if this conspiracy succeeds, it will not only further accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism and lead the Japanese nation onto a new path of war, but also bring a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world.

The telegram stated that we express great anger at the Kishida government's bloody suppression and barbaric persecution of the Japanese people. We firmly believe that as long as the Japanese people and Japanese young students continue to strengthen unity and carry out an indomitable struggle, they will surely be able to smash all the conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and achieve final victory.

    电报说，美日反动派加紧修改日美“安全条约”，旨在加强日美军事同盟，复活日本军国主义，敌视中国、苏联，向东南亚扩张，在远东策划新的侵略战争。日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，不仅是为了保卫日本的民族利益和安全，而且对于加强保卫远东及世界和平的事业也有重大作用。中国人民一向深切关怀和坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争，并把日本人民斗争的发展和胜利，看作是保卫亚洲和世界和平共同事业的重要贡献。
    电报说，我们坚信，英勇的日本人民在各国爱好和平的人民的声援和支持下，一定会更加团结一致，再接再厉，信心百倍地粉碎美日反动派的任何阴谋，取得最后的胜利。

    电报说，我们兴奋地看到日本工人和人民为了反对修改日美“安全条约”，正进行着声势愈来愈浩大的斗争。我们对于日本工人和人民在第八次反对日美“安全条约”统一行动中所表现的英勇而团结的精神表示衷心的敬意。
    电报说，美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，反对美日反动派加紧复活日本军国主义和保卫远东和世界和平是中日两国人民的共同任务。中国工人和中国人民一向把日本人民所进行的反对修改日美“安全条约”并进而废除这一条约的斗争当作是自己的斗争，并且始终一贯地支持你们的正义斗争。
    电报说，岸信介政府27日出动大批警察，对向国会请愿的日本工人和人民进行血腥镇压，非法搜查工会机关，并阴谋对民主团体进行新的大规模镇压。对此，我们极为愤慨，并向受伤的工人们表示深切的慰问。
    电报最后说，我们深信，英勇的日本工人和人民一定会更加坚强，团结一致，把斗争坚持到底。最后胜利必定属于日本工人和人民。
    新华社2日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天打电报给日本妇女团体联合会和阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，表示支持日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    电报说，我们高兴地看到，爱好和平的日本人民反对修改和要求废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，正在一天比一天高涨。中国人民和妇女对于日本人民的正义斗争，一贯给予同情和支持。
    电报说，我们相信勇敢坚强的日本人民，决不会因岸信介政府采取法西斯镇压政策而屈服，定将进一步加强团结，对岸信介反动政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋，展开不屈不挠的斗争。
    电报说，“亲爱的姊妹们！在你们争取独立、民主、和平、中立的正义斗争中，全中国以及全世界爱好和平的人民永远和你们站在一起，最后胜利一定属于日本人民。”

    电报指出，现在美日反动派不顾日本人民的坚决反对，企图在明年1月强行签订新的日美“安全条约”，来加强对日本人民的压迫和掠夺，增强反对中国和苏联的公开的军事同盟。很明显，如果这一阴谋得逞，将不仅进一步加速日本军国主义的复活，把日本民族引上新的战争道路，而且也给亚洲和世界的和平带来严重威胁。
    电报说，我们对岸信介政府向日本人民进行的血腥镇压和野蛮迫害，表示极大的愤怒。我们深信，日本人民和日本青年学生只要继续加强团结，进行不屈不挠的斗争，就一定能够粉碎美日反动派的一切阴谋，取得最后的胜利。
