(Report from our Berlin correspondent on the 19th) Since mid-November, the German Democratic Republic's factories and mines have been constantly reporting successes in completing this year's production plans. At present, factories and mines that have not yet completed their plans are seizing the time to strive to complete this year's plan one week ahead of schedule on December 24th. Workers in factories and mines that have already completed their plans have proposed new overproduction targets and organized outstanding workers to provide socialist assistance to units that have difficulty completing their plans.

　　The steel industry is leading the way this year. All blast furnaces at the Stalin Iron and Steel Combine have reached the planned 1960 targets in all aspects of production this year. The Filipp production team at this plant completed this year's ironmaking plan as early as late November. Now they are striving to produce an additional 20,000 tons of pig iron for the country before the end of the year. The Antivarimburg smelting plant also completed its annual task in the first week of December. Workers from all seven blast furnaces in the plant are trying to help the Thomas Steel Plant complete its plan.

　　Coal miners have also done an excellent job in completing the state plan ahead of schedule. After completing this year's plan ahead of schedule, the workers of the various open-pit lignite mines in Zendenburg are now fighting to complete the extra 400,000 tons of lignite for export. Workers at the Karl Marx hard coal mine in Zwickau raise a red light on the mine shaft tower every day, indicating that the daily production plan has been completed. On December 11, this coal mine completed its annual plan twenty days ahead of schedule and saved 950,000 marks for the country.

　　Potash salt is one of the important resources of the German Democratic Republic. Good results have also been achieved in potash salt mining this year. After completing their annual tasks ahead of schedule, the potash salt mines in the Erfurt Special Zone proposed a plan to overproduce 50,000 tons by the end of the year and have now completed more than 46,000 tons. The Karl Liebknecht factory was the first to implement the "Red Production Conference" system in the potash salt industry. At these short gatherings, which are attended by all employees every day, political and ideological issues are discussed and shortcomings in production and management are criticized. This system has played a positive role in promoting the factory's production.

　　Workers in various basic construction projects are also stepping up their efforts to complete their plans. The Rostock New Port construction project has completed this year's construction plan one month ahead of schedule. Excavation workers have completed the plan for 6.2 million cubic meters of earthwork this year and now plan to excavate another 400,000 cubic meters before the end of the year.

　　While completing this year's plans, factories and mines have also fully discussed next year's production work. Many factories and mines have specifically stipulated the production tasks for January and even the first quarter of next year. When discussing preparations for next year's production, the state-owned Lutis Elben Chemical Plant put forward a plan including technology, organization, and specific measures, and mobilized all employees to discuss it. On December 1, factories in Berlin held a review day on the preparation of the 1960 production plan, so that every worker knew the production tasks for next year. At present, the trade unions of state-owned factories and mines are mobilizing employees and factory and mine administrations to sign collective contracts for next year. The collective contracts particularly emphasize the comprehensive completion of the plan and the socialist way of working, studying, and living. This year, 3,000 semi-state-owned enterprises also signed collective contracts for the first time. Their collective contracts also emphasized the completion of the state plan and the development of socialist working conditions.

    德意志民主共和国广大职工年尾时间抓得紧
    提前完成今年计划再提新的超产指标
    已完成计划的企业正组织力量帮助困难单位赶上先进
    本报柏林19日电　11月中旬以来，德意志民主共和国各地厂矿企业就不断传来完成今年生产计划的捷报。目前，还没完成计划的厂矿正在抓紧时间争取在12月24日提前一周完成今年计划，已经完成计划的厂矿的职工，又提出了新的超产指标，并组织了优秀工人对完成计划有困难的单位进行社会主义帮助。
    钢铁企业今年走在前面。斯大林斯塔德联合炼铁企业的所有高炉今年在生产的各方面都已达到预订的1960年指标。这个厂的菲利浦生产队，早在11月下旬就完成了今年的炼铁计划，现在他们争取在年前为国家多生产两万吨生铁。安提瓦林堡的冶炼厂也在12月的第一周就完成了全年任务，全厂七个高炉的工人正设法帮助托马斯钢厂完成计划。
    采煤工人在提前完成国家计划中，也很出色。森登堡的各个露天褐煤矿的职工在提前完成今年计划后，现在又为完成计划外的四十万吨出口褐煤奋战。兹威卡的卡尔·马克思硬煤矿工人每天都在矿井口的塔上升起红灯，表明完成了日产计划。12月11日这个煤矿提前了二十天完成全年计划，并为国家节约了九十五万马克。
    钾盐是德意志民主共和国重要资源之一。今年钾盐开采也获得良好成绩。埃富特专区各钾盐矿在提前完成全年任务后，提出了到年底超额生产五万吨的计划，现在又完成了四万六千多吨。卡尔·力克勒厂第一次在钾盐工业中推行“红色生产会议”制度，每天在这种有全体职工参加的简短集会上，讨论政治思想问题和批评生产和管理工作的缺点，这种制度对于推动这个厂的生产起了良好作用。
    各项基本建设工程中的工人也在加紧完成计划。罗斯托克新港建设工程已提前一个月完成今年的施工计划。挖掘工人今年已完成了六百二十万立方米的土方工程计划，现在计划在年前再挖四十万立方米。
    各厂矿企业在完成今年计划的同时，对于明年的生产工作也做了充分讨论。许多厂矿已具体规定了明年1月份甚至第一季度的生产任务。国营鲁蒂斯尔本化工厂在讨论明年生产准备时，提出了一项包括技术、组织和具体措施的计划，发动全厂职工讨论。柏林各工厂在12月1日举行了1960年生产计划准备情况检查日，使每一个工人都对明年的生产任务心中有数。目前，各国营厂矿企业的工会正发动职工和厂矿行政管理方面签订明年的集体合同。在集体合同中特别强调了全面完成计划和以社会主义方式进行劳动、学习和生活。今年还有三千家半国营企业第一次签订集体合同，在他们的集体合同中，也强调了完成国家计划和发展社会主义工作条件。
