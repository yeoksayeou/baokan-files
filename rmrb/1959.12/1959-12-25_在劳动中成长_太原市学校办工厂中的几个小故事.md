　　Growing Up in Labor
　　——A Few Short Stories from Taiyuan City School-Run Factories
　　By our reporters Feng Dongshu and Guo Jie
    From Doubt to Praise

    The affiliated middle school of Taiyuan Normal College has an electrical sewing machine repair and manufacturing factory. Some people call it the “Four Very” factory. This means the factory is very small, its effect is very large, the equipment is very simple, and the products are very good. Purchasing personnel from other places are very surprised to see such good products being produced in this simple school factory.

    One day, a purchasing agent from Ludian Iron Smelting Plant in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, came to the factory. He wanted to buy three 70-horsepower starters. After being introduced by the Taiyuan Municipal Machinery Bureau, he found this place. When he walked into the workshop, he saw that most of the workers were young students, and many of the tools, like hammers and wrenches, etc., were obviously made by them with scrap iron and iron bars. At this time, he hesitated: "Relying on these kids, with such a small setup, to produce electrical equipment, is that okay?" Since the factory had agreed, he had to wait patiently.

    He never expected that the young masters of this factory were so capable: although they were all young students, when they worked, they were like real workers, all full of energy, working so seriously, and so methodically. The factory did not have equipment for winding coils, so the students, under the guidance of the master, used wooden frames to wind the coils; the factory did not have a press, so the students used two triangular irons to make iron clamps to replace the press; silicon steel sheets were both expensive and scarce, so they went to the big factories to pick up scraps, using the edges and corners left over from cutting. They not only produced the starters, but also the products were excellent. When the purchasing agent received the items he had been waiting for, he also received a national inspection certificate. Even more unexpected to him was that the price of each starter was fifty yuan cheaper than he had originally estimated. Looking at all this, he said meaningfully to the factory director: "The students nowadays are really great!"

    "Who are 'They'?"

    The story takes place in the plastic factory of Taiyuan No. 7 Middle School.

    The three groups in the molding section of the first-year class are engaged in a lively red flag competition. One day, with only half an hour left before the end of work, Gao Ruipeng, a student in the third molding group, had already produced more than 1,400 light switches. It seemed certain that he would pass the 1,600 mark by the end of the shift. He also remembered the spirited way his competitors Wu Chongpu and Cao Qiuxiang had spoken to him when he took over the shift: "We are doing 1,500 today, and not a single defective product." Now, he was happily calculating: when he met them after work, he would surely leave them speechless. Unexpectedly, the electric heating wire on the press suddenly broke, and production came to a halt immediately. It could have broken earlier or later, but it just had to break at this crucial moment, making Xiao Gao so anxious that he slapped the electric furnace with his hand. Coincidentally, he actually connected the heating wire, and the electric furnace glowed red again. He was so happy that he almost jumped up, and rolled up his sleeves to start the machine. However, Master Guo Wuhe, who worked with him, did not add any material to the machine. Instead, he picked up a screwdriver and said to Xiao Gao: "The heating wire is touching, it will break again in a while, let's just change to a new one!" It would take at least half an hour to change a heating wire, and it would be time to get off work after the new wire was changed. If he didn't reach 1,600, he would be preparing good conditions for the next shift. Xiao Gao muttered unhappily, "Master Guo, we're fixing the electric furnace for 'them', and the next shift will be overproducing again. Let's just work for a while while the heating wire is connected, and change the heating wire after work!"

    Guo Wuhe was an old worker sent by Taiyuan Plastic Factory to assist the school in running the factory. Usually, he paid close attention to the students' ideological progress. Hearing Xiao Gao's words today, he enlightened Xiao Gao, saying, "Little devil, you're wrong. Who are 'they'? They are all our own comrades, how did they become 'them'? Our entire production is like a game of chess, only caring about the 'pawn' moving, without considering the overall situation, how can the entire plan be completed? Doing good things yourself, leaving difficult things to others, it's not glorious to win the red flag either!" These words made Xiao Gao blush, and he hurriedly helped the master repair the electric furnace.

    After work, Xiao Gao could not calm down. Master Guo's words kept turning over in his mind. These words were like a mirror, evoking many memories: when he got off work, he always pushed everything away and left, pushing the tools, products, and raw materials to the master to sort out, wasn't he also leaving the difficulties to others? He was the geometry representative in the class, but he was always unwilling to spend more energy to help his classmates improve their geometry level, wasn't he also only caring about himself...? He slowly realized that he lacked the best qualities in the master. He realized that "what he should learn from the master is not only technology, but more importantly, the noble communist qualities in the master. In order to always remember the education he received that day, he wrote this incident in his diary.

    The Story of the Gloves

    The story of a pair of gloves is circulating in Taiyuan No. 7 Middle School. The story is like this: When the student Cao Huiling heard that she was going to work in the molding section of the school's plastic factory, she muttered in her heart: Usually we always say that we want to learn from the working class, but this time we go to the factory to work, and we are with the workers every day, what should we learn? So she made a vaguely defined learning plan for herself: in the factory, she must sweep the floor diligently, fetch water diligently, be diligent in everything, have a good relationship with the masters, and see what exactly is the working-class ideology in the masters.

    For the first two days after entering the factory, she felt that the old masters were all good, but she didn't have any particularly outstanding feelings. However, since the story of the gloves happened, her feelings changed. One day, she was tightening the screws on a steel mold, and accidentally pinched the hot screw on the broken hole of her glove, which almost made her cry. This was seen by Master Li Demin next to her, who hurriedly told her to take off her gloves and gave her his good gloves. She felt sorry, but the master insisted that she wear them. After work, Master Li silently took the pair of broken gloves away. Cao Huiling thought that Master Li must have gone to replace them with new ones, so she waited to wear new gloves tomorrow. However, when she took the gloves from Master Li the next day at work, her face turned red, and her heart was just pounding. She couldn't put her hands in the gloves. It was still the pair of broken gloves, but there were several large and small stitches added to the broken place, and it was obvious that Master Li had personally patched them. She thought: I am an apprentice, and a female student, but I want a male master to mend my gloves, how embarrassing. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that the masters all had a noble style of caring for others and helping others. Thinking this way, her original "learning plan" was forgotten at some point. But the real learning began, she poured water for the master more diligently than before, and tried to keep the master from sweeping the floor more often. When the master's gloves were broken, she also tried to take them to mend. Although things were still those things, the thoughts and feelings of doing these things were different. In the past, it was to have a good relationship, but now she felt from the bottom of her heart that she should be like the masters, and be a truly noble person who can sacrifice herself and care for others.

　　在劳动中成长
　　——太原市学校办工厂中的几个小故事
　　本报记者　冯东书　郭洁
    从怀疑到赞扬
    太原师范专科学校附属中学有一个电器缝纫机修造厂，有人把它叫做“四很”工厂。意思是厂很小，作用很大，设备很简陋，产品很好。外地来的采购人员，看到那么好的产品是从这个简陋的学校工厂里生产出来的，十分惊奇。
    有一天，厂里来了一位河南登封县芦店炼铁厂的采购员。他想买三台七十马力的启动器，经过太原市机械局的介绍找到了这里。他走进车间一看，车间里的工人大部分是年轻的学生，很多工具，像鎯头、扳子等等，一看就知道都是他们自己用废铁块、铁条制造的。这时他犹豫起来了：“就凭这些小鬼，这么个摊子，就要生产电器设备，行吗？”既然厂方答应了，他只得耐心的等下去。
    他完全没有想到，这个工厂的年轻主人有那么大的本事：他们虽然都是些年轻学生，但是干起活来，却像真正的工人一样，个个意气风发，干得那么认真，那么有条不紊。厂里没有缠线包的设备，学生就在师傅指导下，利用木头架子把线包缠好；厂里没有压力机，学生就用两块三角铁作成铁夹子，代替了压力机；矽钢片既贵又缺，他们就到大工厂去拣破烂，用人家裁剩下来的边边、角角。他们不仅把启动器生产出来了，而且产品非常出色，当这位采购员接到他盼望已久的东西的时候，同时还得到了一份国家检验合格证书，更出乎他意料的是每台启动器的价格比他原来估计的还便宜五十元。看着这一切，他意味深长地对厂长说：“现在的学生，可真是好样的！”
    “人家是谁？”
    故事发生在太原市第七中学的塑料工厂里。
    高一班在成型工段劳动的三个小组，正在开展着热火朝天的红旗竞赛。一天，离下班还剩半个钟头，成型三组的学生高瑞鹏生产电灯开关已经超过了一千四百个。看来，到下班闯过一千六百的大关是十拿十稳了。他又想起接班时，竞赛对手吴崇朴、曹秋香对他说话的那种神气：“我们今天是一千五百，废品可一个也没有。”现在，他心里乐滋滋地盘算着：下班见了面，管保叫他们哑了嘴。不料，压力机上的电炉丝突然断了，生产顿时停下来。迟不断，早不断，偏偏断在这个节骨眼上，急得小高用手直拍电炉。巧得很，竟把炉丝接上了，电炉又重新放出了红光。他高兴的几乎跳起来，挽起袖子就想开机器。可是和他一起工作的老师傅郭伍和却不往机器里加料，反而拿起改锥来对小高说：“炉丝碰到一块，一会儿还会断的，干脆换个新的吧！”换一条炉丝至少要半个钟头，换完新丝就该下班了。自己达不到一千六百个，反倒给下一班准备了好条件。小高满脸不高兴地嘟喃着“郭师傅咱给人家修电炉，下一班又该超产了。现在趁炉丝接上咱先干一会，炉丝留待下班再换吧！”
    郭伍和是太原塑料厂派到学校协作办工厂的老工人，平时，他很注意学生思想的进步。今天听了小高的话，他就给小高开导说：“小鬼，你想错了。人家是谁？都是自己的同志怎么成了人家？咱们整个生产就和一盘棋一样，只顾‘卒’走，不顾全盘，整个计划怎么能完成呢？好事自己干，难事让别人，得了红旗也不光彩啊！”一席话说得小高面红耳赤，赶忙帮师傅修起电炉来。
    下班了，小高心里却平静不下来。郭师傅的话老在他脑子里转，这些话像一面镜子，勾起了他许许多多的回忆：自己一下班总是一推就走，工具、产品、原料什么都推给师傅去整理，不也是把困难让给别人吗？自己是班里的几何代表，却总是不愿多花费点精力去帮助同学提高几何水平，不也是只顾自己吗……。他慢慢体会到自己缺乏师傅身上最好的东西。他觉察到他“要向师傅学习的不仅是技术，更重要的是学习师傅身上的共产主义高贵品质。为了永远记住这一天所得到的教育，他把这件事写在了日记里。
    手套的故事
    一副手套的故事，在太原第七中学流传着。事情是这样的：学生曹慧玲听说要到学校塑料厂成型工段去当工人，心里就嘀咕起来：往常总是说要向工人阶级学习，这回子到工厂劳动，天天和工人们在一起，该学个甚呀？于是她给自己订了个不太明确的学习计划：在工厂里一定要勤扫地，勤打水，要样样都勤，和师傅们要搞好关系，看看在师傅们身上到底什么是工人阶级思想。
    进厂最初两天，她觉得老师傅都挺好，但也没有什么突出的感觉，可是自从发生了手套的故事以后，她的感觉就变了。有一天，她正在拧钢模上的螺丝，一不小心刚好把滚烫的螺丝捏在手套的破窟窿眼上，烫的她几乎哭了出来，这事被旁边的李德民师傅看见了，就赶忙叫她把手套脱下来，把自己手上的好手套换给了她，她过意不去，可是师傅非叫她戴上不可。下了班，李师傅不声不响地把副破手套戴走了。曹慧玲想一定是李师傅给换新的去了，那就等着明天戴新手套吧。可是，第二天上班时，她在李师傅手中接过手套一看，脸色刷的一下通红了，心里只是“扑通扑通”跳，手是怎么也插不进手套里去了。原来还是那副破手套，不过在破的地方增加了几个一针大一针小的补钉，一看就知道是李师傅亲自补的。她想：自己是个徒弟，而且是个女学生，却要男师傅来补手套，多难为情。她越想越感到师傅们身上都有一种关心别人、帮助别人的高尚风格。她这样想着，原来的那一套“学习计划”，不知什么时候就给忘掉了。但是真正地学习却开始了，她给师傅倒水比过去更勤，抢着不让师傅扫地的时候也更多，师傅们的手套坏了，也尽量争着拿来补，事情虽然还是那些事情，干这些事的思想感情却不同了，过去是为了搞好关系，现在她从内心里感到她应该像师傅们那样，作一个能牺牲自己关心别人的真正高尚的人。（附图片）
