The communes in Linchuan link all water conservancy projects into an irrigation network.
    Large, medium, and small reservoirs in Linchuan are interconnected.
    Establishing large and medium-sized main reservoirs within the small reservoir groups, building auxiliary small reservoirs around the main reservoirs, and connecting the main and auxiliary projects into a complete irrigation system using canals.
    Nanchang, December 6th (reported by this newspaper) - The people's communes in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, have connected over four thousand large, medium, and small water conservancy projects into six irrigation systems, achieving agricultural irrigation throughout the county.
    This winter, the people's communes in Linchuan County have concentrated over 50,000 commune members to build more than ten large and medium-sized reservoirs, such as Jinlong and Yunshan, each irrigating thousands or tens of thousands of mu. Simultaneously, they have also constructed canals linking more than one hundred small reservoirs. These hundreds of large, medium, and small reservoirs, along with the more than thirty large and medium-sized reservoirs built last winter and this spring, have been linked through more than 2,970 kilometers of canals, connecting the county's more than 4,200 small reservoirs that have already been built into six major irrigation systems with large reservoirs such as Shangyou, Hongqi, and Yuejin as the main bodies, achieving agricultural irrigation throughout the county. The county has 980,000 mu of cultivated land, requiring a total irrigation volume of 900 million cubic meters. The reservoirs built this year and in the past few years can store 410 million cubic meters of water, and the controlled water diversion irrigation projects can divert 29 cubic meters of water per second. Combined with the water stored in mountain ponds, the total storage capacity is nearly 1 billion cubic meters, thus enabling 100% of the county's farmland to have water conservancy facilities, with over 85% of the farmland achieving self-flowing irrigation, and the irrigation water reaching the highest standard of 800 cubic meters per mu.
    Linchuan County's experience of establishing large and medium-sized main reservoirs irrigating over 10,000 and 1,000 mu within the small reservoir groups, building auxiliary small reservoirs around the main reservoirs and along the canals, and combining the main and auxiliary projects into a complete irrigation system through canals, and using the water from large and medium-sized reservoirs to regulate the small reservoirs, and using the water from small reservoirs to compensate for the shortcomings of long canals and high losses in large and medium-sized reservoirs, is a successful experience in combining large, medium, and small reservoirs. Before 1956, Linchuan County built over 2,000 small reservoirs, which could resist droughts for more than twenty days, but due to their dispersion and lack of sufficient water sources, 90% of the reservoirs dried up when faced with major droughts. This year and last year, Linchuan County adopted this experience, established forty large and medium-sized projects irrigating over 10,000 and 1,000 mu, and excavated more than 2,000 kilometers of canals for irrigation and communication with small reservoirs. While constructing large and medium-sized reservoirs and canals, it also built more than 300 small reservoirs near the main reservoirs and canals, and connected them into a system with the large and medium-sized reservoirs, turning stagnant water into flowing water, and increasing the drought resistance capacity from twenty days to sixty days or even one hundred days.
    To ensure that large, medium, and small reservoirs have reliable water sources and do not become "sky-watching" reservoirs, all thirty-four medium and small rivers in the county have also been utilized in stages. The county began building many small reservoirs in 1955, but because most of the reservoirs were not built on rivers, and their capacity was small and drought resistance was low, whenever a major drought occurred, not only did it require mobilizing more than 100,000 people to fight the drought, but it was also impossible to avoid varying degrees of losses to 200,000 mu of farmland, affecting the leap forward in agricultural production. This year and last year, Linchuan County comprehensively planned the utilization of medium and small river resources, and built more than thirty large, medium, and small reservoirs irrigating 10,000 mu, 1,000 mu, and 100 mu respectively in the upper, middle, and downstream reaches of medium and small rivers and their tributaries. In the plains where conditions for building reservoirs did not exist, measures such as damming rivers and diverting water through ditches were adopted to build the Jinlin and other three water diversion projects irrigating more than 40,000 mu. To enable the water diversion projects to play a greater role, many controlled branch canals were opened on the main canals, and small ditches and channels were used to connect the branch canals, so that the irrigation area of the water diversion projects doubled, and agricultural production leaped forward a big step. In the seventy-day drought of 1956, not only did all the reservoirs dry up, but more than 400,000 mu of rice also suffered reduced yields. This year, in the one-hundred-day drought, not only did dozens of large and medium-sized reservoirs still have 20% to 50% of their water, but even the water in the small reservoirs connected to the large and medium-sized system was not used up. This not only saved 640,000 anti-drought labor days, but also ensured that the county's 770,000 mu of rice achieved a record yield of 1,039 jin per mu. Due to the solution of irrigation problems, 300,000 mu of single-season rice in mountainous and hilly areas were converted into double-season rice, and 113 poor teams became rich teams.
    It is difficult to achieve the unified planning of water resources, the unified layout of projects, the large-scale construction of medium and large reservoirs of 1,000 to 80,000 mu, and the linking of more than 4,000 small reservoirs throughout the county without the strong power of the people's commune. Before the establishment of the people's commune, although more than 3,000 small reservoirs were built, not a single large reservoir was built, more than thirty large and small rivers were not developed and utilized, and more than 4,000 reservoirs did not form a whole. In the year and more since the establishment of the people's commune, not only have thirteen large reservoirs and more than twenty medium-sized reservoirs been built, but also more than thirty medium and small rivers have been utilized, and more than 4,000 small projects have been combined with large projects into six wholes according to a unified plan.
    The Rural Work Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a special investigation on Linchuan County's experience in building water conservancy projects combining large, medium, and small projects, affirmed Linchuan County's achievements, and called on the province to learn from and promote Linchuan County's experience, carry out water conservancy construction in a faster, better, and more economical way, and solve the province's water conservancy problems.

    公社齐心协力把所有水利工程联成灌溉网
    临川大中小水库脉络相通
    在小型水库群中建立大中型主体水库，在主体水库外围补建辅助性小型水库，用渠道把主体工程和辅助工程联结成一个完整的灌溉体系
    本报南昌6日电　江西省临川县各人民公社把四千多处大中小水利工程，联成六个灌溉系统，实现了全县农田水利化。
    临川县各人民公社今冬集中了五万多社员，兴建金龙、云山等十余座灌溉千亩和万亩以上的大中型水库，同时还兴建了串连一百多座小型水库的渠道。这百余座大中小型水库，和去冬今春建成的三十多座大中型水库，通过二千九百七十多公里长的渠道，把全县已建成的四千二百多处小水库，联成了以上游、红旗、跃进等大型水库为主体的六大灌溉系统，实现了全县农田水利化。这个县共有耕地九十八万亩，所需灌溉水量共为九亿立方米。今年和过去几年所修的水库可蓄水四亿一千万立方米，有控制的引水灌溉工程每秒钟能引水二十九个流量，再加山塘蓄水，总蓄水量已近十亿立方米左右，从而使全县100％的农田有了水利设施，85％以上的农田达到了灌溉自流化，灌溉用水也达到了每亩八百方的最高标准。
    临川县在小型水库群中建立灌溉万亩和千亩以上的大中型主体水库，在主体水库外围和渠道上建立辅助性的小型水库，通过渠道把主体与辅助工程，结合成一个完整的灌溉体系，并用大中型水库的水调剂小型水库，用小型水库的水弥补大中型水库渠道长、损耗大的缺点，是一项大中小水库互相结合的成功经验。临川县1956年以前建成的二千多处小型水库，虽能抗御二十多天旱灾，但由于分散和缺乏充足的水源，每遇到较大的旱情，就有90％的水库干涸。今年和去年，临川县接受了这一经验，兴办了四十座灌溉万亩和千亩以上的大中型工程，同时开挖了二千多公里长的渠道，用以灌溉和沟通小型水库；在兴建大中型水库和渠道的同时，还在主体水库和渠道附近，兴修了三百多座小型水库，并使其与大中型水库连成体系，变死水为活水，使抗旱能力由二十天提高到六十天以至百天。
    为保证大中小水库都有可靠的水源，不成为“望天”下雨的水库，全县三十四条中小河流也都被分级利用起来。这个县从1955年开始就兴办了许多小型水库，但由于大多数水库没有建在河流上，再加容量小、抗旱能力低，每当发生较大旱情，不仅要出动十余万人抗旱，还无法避免二十万亩农田受到程度不同的损失，影响了农业生产的跃进。今年和去年，临川县全面地规划了中小河流资源的利用，并把灌溉万亩、千亩和百亩的三十多个大中小型水库，分别建设在中小河的上中游以及支流。在没有建立水库条件的平原地区，采取了拦河筑坝、开沟引水等办法，修建了金临等三个灌田四万亩以上的引水工程。为使引水工程发挥更大作用，还在干渠上开辟了许多有控制的支渠，并用支渠串连了小沟小圳，使引水工程灌溉面积成倍增加，农业生产向前跃进了一大步。1956年七十天干旱，不仅全部水库干涸，还有四十多万亩水稻减产。今年一百天大旱，不但几十个大中型水库还存有20％到50％的水，就连与大中型接成体系的小型水库的水都没有用完。这不但节省了六十四万个抗旱劳动日，还保证了全县七十七万亩水稻，获得亩产一千零三十九斤的特大丰收。山区和丘陵区由于灌溉问题的解决，三十万亩单季稻改成了双季稻，一百一十三个穷队变成了富队。
    统筹水利资源，统一工程布局，大量兴建千亩至八万亩的中型和大型水库，并把遍及全县的四千多处小型水库串连起来，没有人民公社的强大力量是难以办到的。人民公社成立前虽也兴建三千多座小型水库，但大型水库一个也没有建成，三十多条大小河流也没有开发利用，四千多处水库更没有形成整体。人民公社成立后的一年多时间，不仅兴建了十三个大型水库、二十多个中型水库，还把三十多条中小型河流利用起来，并使四千多处小型工程与大型工程按照统一规划结合成六个整体。
    中共江西省委农村工作部对临川县大中小结合修水利的经验，进行了专题调查，肯定了临川县的成就，号召全省学习和推广临川县的经验，多快好省地进行水利建设，解决全省的水利问题。
