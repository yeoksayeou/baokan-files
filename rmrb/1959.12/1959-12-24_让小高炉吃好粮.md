　　Let Small Blast Furnaces Eat Well
    Ensuring that small blast furnaces "eat" well is one of the important guarantees for the "small foreign groups" of iron and steel to achieve high production, high quality, low consumption, and low cost. The smelting workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory has created a good set of experiences in this regard, which is to use indigenous methods to produce self-fluxing sintered ore.
    What are the benefits of sintered ore powder? It can turn lean ore powder, which cannot be directly smelted in small blast furnaces, into high-grade artificial rich ore. And the use of self-fluxing sintered ore in blast furnaces has four major advantages: First, it has high porosity, a large contact surface with gas in the furnace, and is easy to reduce, thus helping to reduce the coke ratio and increase production; high porosity also helps to improve the air permeability of the furnace charge, allowing for more air blowing and more iron tapping. Second, there is a strong desulfurization effect during sintering, and usually about 90% of the sulfur can be removed during sintering, thus helping to improve the quality of pig iron. Third, the use of self-fluxing sintered ore can greatly reduce the amount of limestone added to the blast furnace, which is conducive to reducing the coke ratio and improving the slagging system. Fourth, after the ore powder is subjected to a simple beneficiation process and then sintered into sintered ore, the iron content can generally be increased by 10% to 20% or more, thus greatly increasing production.
    In the past few years, large and medium-sized blast furnaces have used a large amount of self-fluxing sintered ore. Practice has proved that blast furnaces using about 50% of self-fluxing sintered ore can increase production by at least 30% or more. We believe that after the experience of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory's smelting workshop in sintering ore powder using indigenous methods is promoted throughout the country, it will enable small blast furnaces to bloom more and better flowers of overall leap forward.

　　让小高炉吃好粮
    让小高炉“吃”好，是钢铁“小洋群”实现高产、优质、低耗、低成本的重要保证之一。济南印染厂冶炼车间在这方面创造了一套好经验，这就是用土办法生产自熔性烧结矿。
    烧结矿粉有什么好处呢？它可以把不能直接用小高炉冶炼的贫矿粉变成高品位的人造富矿。而高炉使用自熔性烧结矿有四大优点：第一，它的气孔率高，在炉内同煤气的接触面大，易于还原，因而有利于降低焦比和增加产量；气孔率高，又有助于改善炉料透气性，可以多鼓风、多出铁。第二，烧结过程中有强烈的去硫作用，通常硫在烧结时可以脱掉90％左右，因而有利于提高生铁质量。第三，使用自熔性烧结矿，可以大大减少加入高炉的石灰石数量，有利于降低焦比和改进造渣制度。第四，矿粉经过简易选矿过程再烧成烧结矿以后，含铁量一般可以提高10％到20％以上，因而能大大提高产量。
    过去几年来，大、中型高炉已经大量使用了自熔性烧结矿，实践证明，高炉配用50％左右的自熔性烧结矿，最少能增产30％以上。我们相信，济南印染厂冶炼车间土法烧结矿粉的经验在全国推广以后，将会使小高炉开出更多更好的全面跃进的花朵。
