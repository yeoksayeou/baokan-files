    Our Innovation Station
    Yang Bolin, Worker at Tianjin Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory

    You ask about our "Innovation Station"? It was established last Wednesday. The organizer of the "Innovation Station" is Zhao Baogui, the leader of our maintenance team. Don't let his age of forty-something fool you; his big frame is even stronger than us young people.

    That day, just as the early shift started, and I was squatting down tightening the screws on the water pump, our Factory Director Liu came in. As usual, he stood next to the water pump, looking around. After a while, he asked me, "Kid, where's Lao Zhao?" I said, "He's in the rubber rolling department doing repairs." He plopped down on a small stool, picked up the can of water I had just poured, and tossed his head back, gulping it down in one go.

    After a few minutes of silence, Lao Zhao came in from outside, carrying a wrench. Factory Director Liu stood up and asked him to sit down. Before he could even settle down, Factory Director Liu said, "Lao Zhao, I have good news for you. The Party Committee fully studied the fourth quarter production plan yesterday, and the bureau approved the number I discussed with you." Lao Zhao widened his eyes, held up two fingers, and asked, "Is it twenty thousand?"

    Factory Director Liu said, "Twenty thousand pairs is the average daily output. We want to step into 1960 a month ahead of schedule, so we need to produce at least thirty thousand pairs a day!" Lao Zhao just said there wouldn't be a problem, and Factory Director Liu continued, "Oh, the Party Committee will make a mobilization report this afternoon. 'You logistics soldiers' mustn't fight a passive battle!"

    You know our factory director's temperament. He discusses everything with the experienced masters first. As for me, this little apprentice, hey! He just pats my head and encourages me with a few words: "Kid, you must be energetic. Didn't the Youth League call on you to leap forward into 1960 ahead of schedule? Have you made a plan? You must learn from Xiao Lan; she has already stepped into 1960. Hmm?" I blushed at his words, and he waved his hand at Lao Zhao: "Okay, I need to say hello to Master Qi and the others and ask them to make plans too." After saying that, he went to the shoe forming workshop.

    You know the kind of work our maintenance team does. Besides maintenance and upkeep, we also work on machine tools. If the machines don't break down, we've fulfilled our responsibility. How much the production of sneakers increases doesn't seem to have much to do with us. But the whole factory is leaping forward, so what can we maintenance workers do? I suggested that Lao Zhao make more machine tools, but he disagreed. He said, "That won't do. The factory's main task is sneakers, directly supplying the needs of the people. We can't just focus on making machine tools." You say, what else can we maintenance workers do besides making machine tools? Unexpectedly, Lao Zhao proposed the idea of "giving way without stopping the machine." He advocated making machine tools while supporting the shoe forming workshop to complete the task of increasing sneaker production. It sounds better than it sings. Last month, to support the shoe forming workshop in completing its task, we sent four master craftsmen, and we were so busy all day that we couldn't catch our breath. And now he's talking big again...

    At first, I disagreed, and Lao Zhao immediately gave me a political lesson. He talked about the great significance of completing the task and explained the development plan for next year. He also told me about the idea of the whole chessboard, where the small situation serves the big situation. I understood everything in principle, but we had difficulties. Supporting the shoe forming workshop meant pulling people from our team, and each person in our maintenance team was essential; we couldn't just send people over for fun. Guess what? Lao Zhao told us to move our bedding to the factory and squeezed out four people for the shoe forming workshop.

    The next day, I carried my bedding through the door and was stunned. Our maintenance department's small room was covered with big slogans that read "Amateur Service Station," with couplets on both sides that read "Decisive Battle in the Fourth Quarter, Guarantee a Red Year." The handwriting was Lao Zhao's.

    I pushed open the door and saw Lao Zhao with his sleeves rolled up, and Factory Director Liu wearing oily gloves, repairing the small cart for hanging shoes in the vulcanization department. The factory director took the bedding from my shoulder and said, "Kid, why are you so late? Look, the two of us have modified the cart with multiple hooks. This is an innovation!" After he said that, he squatted down to oil the axle. I didn't have time to change my work clothes and joined in.

    Around lunchtime, the factory director went to the factory affairs meeting. At this time, Lao Zhao gave me some advice: "Look how late you were; the factory director couldn't even eat breakfast..." Then he pointed to the small cart and said, "Our maintenance workers can't just focus on repairs. If possible, we should help the workshops improve their tools. We need to learn to repair and innovate!"

    Just after I sent the small cart away, Han Fengrong from the shoe forming workshop ran over. This little girl shouted as soon as she entered, "Uncle Zhao, our rollers aren't turning anymore. Can you fix them after work?" Lao Zhao took the rollers and said, "I'll deliver them before dawn tomorrow!" After Xiao Han left, Lao Zhao put on his reading glasses to "examine" the rollers, looking left and right, turning them back and forth for a long time. Then he said to me, "Look, if we add a decorative wheel on the left and an eccentric wheel on the right, wouldn't three processes be combined into one?" I said, yes, and he told me to ask Xiao Han for the decorative and eccentric wheels, and then started experimenting according to his plan.

    The next day, Xiao Han ran into our room as if she was collecting a debt. Lao Zhao smiled and handed her the rollers. She was so happy, to say the least, and ran away in a puff of smoke. Soon, she brought all the sisters from her team. They pulled on Lao Zhao and chattered away: "Uncle Zhao! You're so great! This will solve our team's labor productivity problem!..." Just then, Factory Director Liu also came. Somehow, when he saw this scene, he suddenly became serious and said, "Everyone, take a look. Some people say that the shoe forming workshop is manual operation and cannot innovate, but Lao Zhao has broken their conservative thinking!..."

    From that day on, the plaque of our "Amateur Service Station" was changed by everyone, and everyone called our maintenance department the "Innovation Station." All day long, there are many "guests" from various workshops. However, there is not much repair work, but a lot of tool improvements. Look, this is the pneumatic sole machine that was successfully modified yesterday, which can improve efficiency and reduce labor intensity. Lao Zhao told me to send it to the shoe forming workshop immediately for production.

    In my opinion, you should go to the "Innovation Station" and see for yourself. As the saying goes: hearing is false, seeing is believing! (Originally published in Tianjin Daily)

### 我们的革新站

    我们的革新站
    天津大中华橡胶厂工人  杨柏林
    您问我们的“革新站”吗？那是在上星期三成立的。“革新站”的组织者是我们维修组的组长赵宝贵。您别看他今年四十多岁了，可他那大个子比我们年轻人还棒。
    那天刚上早班，我正蹲着拧水泵上的螺丝，咱们的刘厂长进来了。他和往常一样，站在水泵旁边四下张望着。不一会，他问我：“小鬼，老赵呢？”我说：“在轧胶部检修哩。”他一屁股就坐在小椅子上，端起我刚斟的那罐水，一扬脖儿咕咚咕咚地喝个干净。
    沉了几分钟，老赵提着搬子从外面进来了。刘厂长站起来让他坐。还没等他坐稳，刘厂长就说啦：“老赵，告诉你个好消息，昨天党委全面研究了第四季度的生产计划，我和你说的那个数字局里批准啦。”老赵瞪着大眼，伸出两个手指头，问：“是两万吗？”
    刘厂长说：“两万双是平均日产，我们要提前一个月跨进1960年，起码要日产三万！”老赵刚说没问题，刘厂长又说啦：“哦，党委下午就作动员报告，‘你们后勤兵’可别打被动仗啊！”
    咱厂长的脾气您是知道的，有点嘛事都先和老师傅商量。至于我这个小徒弟呀，嗨！只不过是摸摸我的脑袋，鼓励几句：“小鬼，可得鼓劲呀，团委不是号召你们提前跃进1960年吗？你订计划了吗？得向小兰学习呀，人家已经跨进1960年啦。嗯？”我被他说的脸红了，他冲老赵一挥手：“好了，我得向齐师傅他们打个招呼去，叫他们也打算打算。”说完他就去成纽车间了。
    我们维修组干的活您是知道的，除了维修保养，就是搞机床。机器不出毛病，我们的责任就算尽到了，球鞋的产量增加多少，跟我们好像关系不大。可是，全厂都在跃进，我们保全工干点嘛呢？我建议老赵多搞几台机床，可他不同意，他说：“那可不行，全厂的重点任务是球鞋，直接供应人民需要，咱哪能光搞机床呀。”您说我们当保全工的不搞机床又搞嘛呢？没想到老赵提了个“让路不停车”的意见，他主张一面搞机床，一面支援成型车间完成增产球鞋的任务。说的可比唱的好听，前月支援成型车间完成任务，我们去了四个老师傅，忙得我们整天喘不过气来，现在又要说大话……
    起初我心里不同意，老赵马上就给我上了一堂政治课。他讲了完成任务的重大意义，又讲明年的发展计划；还给我讲了小局服从大局的一盘棋观点。从道理上我全通，可是我们有困难哪，支援成型车间得抽人，而我们维修组的人是一个萝卜顶一个坑，不是随便支援着玩儿的。您猜怎么样，老赵叫我们搬铺盖住厂，硬挤出四个人给成型车间。
    第二天，我扛着铺盖一进门，就给闹楞了，我们保全部小屋门口贴满了大标语，上面写着“业余服务站”几个大字，两边还贴着“决战四季度，保证全年红”的对联。看笔体是老赵写的。
    我推开屋门，见老赵挽着袖子，刘厂长带着油手套，正在给硫化部修理挂鞋的小车。厂长从我肩上接过铺盖，说：“小鬼，你怎么才来？看看吧，我俩把小车改成了多挂钩的，这是件革新哪！”他说完就蹲下给车轴上油，我没来得及换工作服，跟着干上了。
    快到吃午饭的时候，厂长开厂务会去了。这时老赵给我提出了意见：“看你来的多晚，厂长连早点都顾不了吃……”他又指着小车说：“咱保全工可不能光在修理上打转，有条件的话，要帮助各车间改进改进工具，要学会修理加革新哪！”
    我刚把小车送走，成型车间的韩凤荣跑来了。这小姑娘，进门就喊：“赵大爷，我们的滚轮不转了，下班后您给修修吧。”老赵接过滚轮就说：“明儿天亮前交件！”小韩走了以后，老赵就戴上老花眼镜给滚轮“相面”，左瞧右看，反过来调过去摆弄半天。然后对我说：“你看，这玩艺儿左边加个花轮，右边加个偏轮，三道工序不就合而为一了吗？”我说，对，他叫我找小韩要花轮偏轮去，接着就按照他的计划搞起试验来了。
    第二天，小韩像要账似的跑进了我们屋。老赵笑眯缝着眼把滚轮递给她，她看了，那个美呀，就甭说了，一溜烟跑了。不大会她把小组的姐妹们全叫来了。她们拉着老赵七言八语地都嚷开了：“赵大爷！你太好了！这下子我们小组的劳动生产率就没问题啦！……”就在这个当儿，刘厂长也来了。不知怎么的，他看到这份情景突然严肃起来，他说：“大家看看吧，有人说成型车间是手工操作不能革新，咱老赵就把他们的保守思想给打破了！……”
    从那天起，我们的“业余服务站”的牌匾儿叫大家给换了，大家都叫我们保全部是“革新站”。一天到晚，各车间来的“客人”可多哩。不过，修理活的可不多，改进工具的倒不少。您看，这是昨天改制成功的气压大底机，既能提高效率，又能减轻劳动强度。老赵叫我马上给成型车间送去投入生产。
    依我看哪，您还是到“革新站”看看去吧，俗话说：耳听是虚，眼见才是实呢！　（原载天津日报）
