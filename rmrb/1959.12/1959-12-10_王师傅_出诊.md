    Master Wang's "House Call"
    Our Master Wang Jinshui is not one for words, but he has a "unique skill" when it comes to work. Others struggle to adjust the blades of the slitting shear, and the silicon steel sheets they cut are often uneven. But when Master Wang gets his hands on it, he does it quickly and well. That's why everyone calls him "Doctor Wang."
    "Doctor Wang" has high output and good quality in his work, but he has a habit of not meddling in "other people's business." He never joins in on other people's conversations, always keeping his mouth shut, wearing a stern face, and focusing solely on his own machine tool.
    However, recently, due to the factory's promotion of technical performance competitions, this old worker, under the education of the Party, has begun to change his attitude of not meddling in "other people's business." He unprecedentedly passed on his skills in public. Everyone watched "Doctor Wang's" performance with admiration, all wanting to learn it immediately. Some young men who were temporarily unable to master the technique wanted to ask Doctor Wang for a "house call," but were afraid that he would ignore "other people's business." Who knew that when these words reached Master Wang's ears, he would actively seek out those workers who were not skilled and patiently help them, saying: How can helping everyone master the technique be considered "other people's business"?
      After "Doctor Wang's" first and second "house calls," in just a few days, even the newly arrived apprentices in our group learned Master Wang's "unique skill." The daily output of silicon steel sheets for the entire group increased from 8,000 millimeters to 14,000 millimeters. The story of Master Wang's "house call" spread throughout our workshop.

### 王师傅“出诊”

    王师傅“出诊”
    我们的王金水师傅不爱说话，可是干活却有个“绝招”。别人调整滚剪床的刀口很费劲，而且剪出的矽钢片常常凸凹不平。可是王师傅一上手，弄得又快又好，因此大伙都管他叫“王大夫”。
    “王大夫”干活产量高、质量好，但是有个不爱管“闲事”的脾气。别人谈论什么他也不插话，老是闭着嘴，扳着脸，一心只管自己的机床。
    可是，最近由于工厂推广技术表演赛，这位老工人在党的教育下，不管“闲事”的态度开始变了。他破天荒地当众传授了自己的技术。大家怀着羡慕的心情看了“王大夫”表演，都想一下学会。有些暂时还不能掌握技术的小伙子，想请王大夫“出诊”，可又怕他不管“闲事”。谁知这话传到王师傅耳中，他竟主动去找那些技术不熟练的工人，耐心地帮助他们，并且说：帮助大伙掌握技术，怎算是“闲事”？
      “王大夫”一次、两次的“出诊”，不几天，我们组里连新来的徒工都学会了王师傅的“绝招”。全组剪矽钢片日产量从八千毫米，提高到一万四千毫米。王师傅“出诊”这件事，就在我们车间里流传开了。
