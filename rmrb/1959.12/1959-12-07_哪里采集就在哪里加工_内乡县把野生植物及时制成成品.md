Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 5th: In the "Small Autumn Harvest" campaign, Neixiang County, Henan Province, mobilized the masses to vigorously engage in processing and utilization, turning the various wild plants collected into finished and semi-finished products in a timely manner. In the two months from October to November, the county has built 3,354 various processing plants (groups), with more than 27,000 people participating in the processing.

    In the early stage of gathering, Neixiang County categorized various wild plants and determined the policy of "relying on people's communes, processing locally, using indigenous methods as the main approach, and focusing on small-scale operations." Based on the principles of making use of whatever is available, adapting to local conditions, building factories according to what is produced, and building factories wherever gathering takes place, a large number of factories (groups) were established in the center of raw material production areas. In order to solve the production technology problems, the factories adopted the methods of state-owned factories leading commune-run factories, commune-run factories leading team-run factories, large factories leading small factories, old factories leading new factories, masters leading apprentices, and inviting in and sending out personnel to carry out mutual assistance and competition between factories, and mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovation. In the past two months, Neixiang County's "Small Autumn Harvest" of gathering, processing, and utilization has increased the average income of the county's agricultural population by 76 yuan per person.

    哪里采集就在哪里加工
    内乡县把野生植物及时制成成品
    据新华社郑州5日电　河南省内乡县在“小秋收”运动中，发动群众大搞加工利用，把采集的各种野生植物，及时制成成品和半成品。在10月到11月两个月时间内，全县已建成各种加工厂（组）三千三百五十四个，参加加工的人数达二万七千多名。
    在采集初期，内乡县就把各种野生植物分类站队，确定了“依靠人民公社、就地加工、土法为主、小型为主”的方针。各地本着因陋就简，因地制宜，出产什么建什么厂，在哪里采集就在哪里建厂的精神，把大量的厂（组）都设在原料产地的中心。为了解决生产技术问题，各厂采用了国营工厂带社办工厂，社办工厂带队办工厂，大厂带小厂，老厂带新厂，师傅带徒弟和请进来、派出去，开展厂与厂的互助互赛等办法，并发动群众大搞技术革新。内乡县近两个月来，从“小秋收”的采集和加工利用中，使全县农业人口平均每人增加收入七十六元。
