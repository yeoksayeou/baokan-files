    An automatic truck loader has been invented by Tang Mingfa, a worker at the Yituli River Forestry Bureau in the Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia. It uses an automatic conveying device to roll the timber onto the truck one by one. Operated by three or four people, it can load a truck (about ten cubic meters) in fifteen minutes, which is faster than loading with a Maas crane. If loaded by hand, it takes six to eight people about forty minutes. This truck loader is powered by a diesel engine driving an automatic conveying device, and the chassis is track-mounted, allowing it to be moved anywhere.

    自动装车机
    内蒙古大兴安岭伊图里河林业局工人唐明发创造了一台自动装车机。它用自动传送装置使木材一根接着一根地滚到车上去。三、四个人操作，十五分钟就装完一辆汽车（十立方米左右），比玛斯起重机装的还快；如果用人抬，六个到八个人需要装四十分钟左右。这种装车机是用柴油机带动一个自动传送装置，底盘是履带式的，可以各处移动。
