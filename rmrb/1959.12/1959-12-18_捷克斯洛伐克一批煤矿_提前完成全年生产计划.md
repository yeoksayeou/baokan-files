Prague, December 17th (Reported by our newspaper) Since the beginning of December, coal mining enterprises in various parts of Czechoslovakia have been reporting good news about completing their annual production plans ahead of schedule.

	In the famous Ostrava hard coal mining area, in addition to the Stalin Coal Mine, the Dukla Coal Mine has also completed its annual production task ahead of schedule and will produce an additional 85,000 tons of coal before the end of the year. Two production teams in the Petr Cingr Coal Mine achieved the production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan thirteen months ahead of schedule at the beginning of this month.

	The Handlova Coal Mine in Slovakia also completed its annual plan on December 9th. Its average daily tunneling rate increased by 21% compared to last year, face output increased by 15.5%, and production costs decreased by 14%.

	In addition, due to the extensive development of socialist labor emulation, the Peace Defenders Coal Mine in Usti nad Labem and the Zapotocky Coal Mine, two large open-pit coal mines in Bohemia, have also reported the good news of completing their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeding their quotas.

    捷克斯洛伐克一批煤矿
    提前完成全年生产计划
    本报布拉格17日电　从12月初以来，捷克斯洛伐克各地的煤矿企业纷纷传出提前完成全年生产计划的喜讯。
    在著名的俄斯特拉发硬煤矿区，除斯大林煤矿外，杜克拉煤矿也已提前完成了年度生产任务，并且将在年底前额外生产八万五千吨煤。彼得钦格尔煤矿中的两个生产队在本月初提前十三个月实现了第二个五年计划的生产指标。
    斯洛伐克的汉德洛伐煤矿也在12月9日完成了全年计划，它的平均日掘进率比去年提高了21％，面产量增长了15.5％，生产成本降低了14％。
    此外，由于社会主义劳动竞赛的广泛开展，波希米亚的两个大露天煤矿，乌斯蒂州的和平保卫者煤矿和萨波托斯基煤矿等也都传出了提前超额完成全年生产计划的捷报。
