	Colorful National Song and Dance Performances, Violin Concerto "Butterfly Lovers" Premiered
    In the New Year, people will once again see the splendid and colorful look of national song and dance art from the performances of the Central National Song and Dance Troupe.
    The Central National Song and Dance Troupe is composed of artists and young actors from seventeen ethnic groups including Han, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uygur, Miao, Yi, Zhuang, Korean, Manchu, Xibe, Daur, Bai, Jingpo, Dai, Dong, and Jing. The programs they perform include continuous in-depth visits to various brotherly ethnic regions in recent years, learning from the lives of the hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups and their rich and colorful song and dance art, and after sorting and processing, as well as excellent creations from other brotherly song and dance troupes. The lyrical and passionate Tibetan song and dance "Riba on the Prairie," the Miao "Wedding Dance" full of folk life flavor, the famous "Goose Dance" performed by dancer Jia Zuoguang, and mixed folk song chorus, folk instrumental music performances, etc., will make the audience feel like living in a multi-ethnic art garden as warm as spring.
    In order to welcome the beginning of the new year, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra has rehearsed a batch of new programs, including violin concertos "Butterfly Lovers," "Spring in Xinjiang," "Happy New Year" and other violin pieces, as well as xylophone and oboe solos, and "Beijing Great Leap Forward Medley" with newly added content.
    The violin concerto "Butterfly Lovers" was composed by He Zhanhao and Chen Gang, students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. It is a dramatic titled concerto full of Jiangnan flavor. It adopts the rich expressive techniques of folk instrumental music in its performance, and through the solo of the violin and the concerto of the orchestra, it expresses the "love, resistance to marriage, and transformation into butterflies" plots in the "Butterfly Lovers" story in a relatively detailed manner. This work is being performed in the capital for the first time.

　　民族歌舞绚丽多彩  小提琴协奏曲“梁祝”首次演出
    新年里，人们将会从中央民族歌舞团的演出中，再一次看到百花齐放的民族歌舞艺术绚丽多彩的风貌。
    中央民族歌舞团是由汉、蒙、回、藏、维吾尔、苗、彝、僮、朝鲜、满、锡伯、达斡尔、白、景颇、傣、侗、京等十七个民族的艺术家和青年演员所组成的。他们演出的节目包括近几年来不断深入各个兄弟民族地区访问演出时，向勤劳勇敢的各族人民生活和丰富多采的歌舞艺术学习，并经过整理加工，以及其他兄弟歌舞团的优秀创作。抒情而又火热的藏族歌舞“草原上的日巴”，富有民间生活风味的苗族“婚礼舞”、舞蹈家贾作光表演的有名的“雁舞”，和混声民歌合唱、民间器乐演奏等，将使观众像是生活在温暖如春的多民族艺术园中。
    中央乐团为了迎接新的一年的开始，已排练出一批新的节目，其中有小提琴协奏曲“梁山伯与祝英台”、“新疆之春”、“新春乐”等小提琴曲和木琴、双簧管独奏，以及加工补充了新内容的“北京跃进大联唱”等。
    小提琴协奏曲“梁祝”，是上海音乐学院学生何占豪、陈刚创作的，是一首富有江南风味的、戏剧性的标题协奏曲。它在演奏上采用了民间器乐丰富的表现手法，通过小提琴的独奏和乐队的协奏，把“梁祝”故事中的“相爱、抗婚和化蝶”等情节比较细致地表达了出来。这部作品在首都还是第一次演出。
