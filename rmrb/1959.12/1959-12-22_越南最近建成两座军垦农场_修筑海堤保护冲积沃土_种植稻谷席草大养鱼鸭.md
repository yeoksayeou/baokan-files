Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: The Vietnamese People's Army has established the "Dawn" and "Aurora" military reclamation farms on the fertile land newly formed over the past decade or so by alluvial deposits near the mouth of the Day River, a tributary of the Red River. The official inauguration ceremonies for these two farms were held on December 17th and 18th respectively.

　　The "Dawn" farm is located on the west bank of the Day River in Ninh Binh Province and has more than 900 hectares of land. The "Aurora" farm is located on the east bank of the Day River in Nam Dinh Province and has 1,000 hectares of land. The first season of autumn rice has already been harvested, with an average yield of more than three tons per hectare. The farm has also planted large areas of rush, peanuts and other cash crops, and raised large numbers of African crucian carp and duck flocks.

　　In order to establish these two farms, the two units of the People's Army, with the support of the local people, spent less than half a year building two solid new seawalls, each more than ten kilometers long, ensuring that nearly two thousand hectares of newly formed land and the lives and property of the nearby people are protected from the threat of sea tides.

　　越南最近建成两座军垦农场
    修筑海堤保护冲积沃土　种植稻谷席草大养鱼鸭
    据新华社河内电　越南人民军在红河支流底河河口近十几年来新冲积成陆地的沃土上建立了“黎明”和“曙光”两个军垦农场。这两个农场先后在12月17日、18日正式举行落成典礼。
    “黎明”农场在底河西岸宁平省省境，有九百多公顷土地。“曙光”农场在底河东岸南定省省境，有一千公顷土地。农场的第一季秋稻已经收割，每公顷平均产量达三吨以上，农场还种上了大片席草、花生等经济作物，养了大量非洲鲫鱼和鸭群。
    为了建立这两个农场，人民军两个单位在当地人民支援下，用了不到半年的时间建成了两条各十公里以上的坚固的新海堤，保证了将近二千公顷新冲积地和附近人民的田地和生命财产免受海潮的威胁。
