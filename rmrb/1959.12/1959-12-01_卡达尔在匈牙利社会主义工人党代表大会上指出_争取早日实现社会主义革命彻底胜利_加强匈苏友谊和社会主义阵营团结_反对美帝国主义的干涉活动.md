Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 30th—Kadar, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, made a report to the Party's Seventh Congress on behalf of the Central Committee. In his report, he first pointed out that the task of this congress is to summarize the party's experience in struggle and put forward future tasks. Although the Central Committee still has shortcomings in its work, it can report its work to the Congress without shame, because the policy it has implemented has been proven to be correct. As long as we compare the serious situation in Hungary three years ago with today's consolidated situation, we can boldly regard this general achievement as a historic victory for the Party, the working class, the Hungarian people, and the socialist revolution. Kadar also expressed deep gratitude to the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, the people of socialist countries, and the progressive humanity of the world for their assistance to Hungary.

    Foreign Policy and International Situation

Kadar then elaborated on Hungary's foreign policy and the international situation in the first part of his report. He said that the goal of our foreign policy is to defend the great achievements made by our people and ensure the peaceful construction of socialism. The basic principles of our country's foreign policy are: Hungarian-Soviet friendship, loyalty to the socialist camp, opposition to imperialism, and peaceful coexistence with all countries and peoples regardless of differences in social systems.

Kadar said that in the past fifteen years, the Soviet Union has twice proven its profound friendship and internationalist spirit towards the Hungarian people with the blood of its sons and daughters. It has also helped the Hungarian people heal the wounds of war and carry out socialist construction in various ways. Hungarian-Soviet friendship is the source of strength, a great pillar, and a guarantee of prosperity for the Hungarian people. Continuously strengthening Hungarian-Soviet friendship is the most important task of our Party and government's foreign policy.

Kadar pointed out that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution ten years ago, followed by the socialist revolution, greatly changed the political landscape of the world. A country with a population of 650 million has been transformed from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country into a socialist world power. Its example and its unprecedented speed of development are inspiring and encouraging. The Chinese example also proves the superiority of the socialist system and the unlimited creativity of a people who have been liberated from oppression.

He said that the socialist camp, with the Soviet Union as its core and leading force, is today the main force for world progress and peace. The basis of Hungarian foreign policy will continue to be to strengthen the strength and unity of the socialist camp and resolutely repel all attempts to undermine this strength and unity.

Kadar expressed Hungary's hope to expand economic and cultural ties with Asian and African countries that have rid themselves of colonial oppression and expressed sympathy for the people of all countries who are striving for national independence.

Kadar said that Hungary's relations with the leading countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and their governments are unsatisfactory. Among them, we have particularly serious contradictions with the U.S. government.

Kadar exposed some facts about the United States' attempts to subvert the Hungarian people's regime and interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. He said that the U.S. reactionary groups are trying to use the United Nations' resolutions against Hungary to achieve the goal of interfering in our country's internal affairs. The ridiculous anti-Hungarian movement stirred up every year around this resolution serves the purpose of anti-Soviet and "cold war" purposes. We have never recognized and will not recognize this illegal resolution that violates the UN Charter.

Kadar said that in the past two or three years, the international situation has eased to a certain extent. The decisive reasons for this change are the growth of the power and peaceful policies of the Soviet Union, the socialist camp, the international workers' movement, and the world peace movement. However, the anti-peace forces that are active in capitalist countries and international life and play an influential role should not be ignored. Therefore, the people of all countries must continue to wage a resolute struggle against the forces of anti-peace and force them to retreat.

After pointing out the achievements of Khrushchev's visit to the United States, Kadar said that we support the Soviet proposal for complete disarmament, and we advocate peaceful coexistence through gradually expanding international ties.

    Domestic Political Situation

In the second part of his report, Kadar talked about Hungary's domestic political situation. He said that the development trend of Hungary's domestic political situation in the past three years has been healthy. The struggle against counter-revolution has tempered and united the socialist forces. The broad masses have made great political progress and have gained rich experience in the class struggle. In the course of this struggle, the unity of our people on the basis of socialist ideology has been further strengthened.

Kadar talked about the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary in 1956 and analyzed in detail the nature and causes of the events according to the opinions of the Party Central Committee. He said that international imperialism, headed by the U.S. reactionary groups, has used all the tools at its disposal to support all kinds of enemies of the Hungarian people since the first day of Hungary's liberation. For many years, imperialism has instigated and incited counter-revolutionary riots and carried out organizational work. Finally, through their agents and political allies, Nagy Imre and his group and the domestic bourgeois counter-revolutionary forces, they finally launched the counter-revolutionary riots. In this way, the domestic counter-revolutionary forces and the international imperialist forces formed an alliance to oppose the Hungarian People's Republic.

Kadar said that the Party will pay long-term attention to all the experiences and lessons learned from the counter-revolutionary riots in the future. However, as far as the counter-revolutionary riots themselves are concerned, they have been completely defeated in all aspects. The current domestic political situation is characterized by stability, consolidation, and rapid development. The people's regime is stronger than before the counter-revolutionary riots, the socialist foundation has been greatly expanded, and socialist construction is progressing smoothly and vigorously. This situation would not have been possible without the political support and selfless labor of the masses.

In his report, Kadar exposed some of the rumors and wishful thinking made by Western newspapers and reactionaries against Hungary. He said that some reactionaries place their hopes on the "withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary." We have repeatedly stated clearly that Soviet troops will continue to be stationed in Hungary until the international situation no longer requires them to do so.

Kadar said that the strength of the Hungarian socialist revolution and the supporters of the socialist revolution have learned what is needed, and they are able to defend our system from enemy attacks. We learn from experience and will not repeat mistakes. We will not forget traitors, class enemies, and imperialists. On the basis of past experience, we must further strengthen our people's country and our system. We must continue to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and implement the principle of democratic centralism in national life. While strengthening the centralized leadership of the state, we will continue to expand the powers of local government organs.

    Economic Situation and Tasks Facing Economic Construction

In the third part of his report, Kadar talked about the economic situation in Hungary and the tasks facing economic construction. He said that our country's economic situation can be said to be good. Since liberation, we have made great achievements in economic construction. From 1949 to the present, our country has established 100 large industrial enterprises, some new socialist industrial cities have been born, and agriculture has also developed. The number of tractors has increased from 7,000 in 1935 to 31,000 this year. The amount of fertilizer applied per Holte of land was only 13.5 kilograms in 1938, but has increased to 77 kilograms this year.

The counter-revolutionary riots and the destructive impact they produced caused the Hungarian people a loss of 22 billion forints. With the efforts of the people and the assistance of socialist countries, the national economy had been restored by the end of 1957. Then, we formulated the economic work policy and the three-year plan for developing the national economy. In 1958, we achieved good results. Compared with 1955, the state-owned industrial production in 1958 increased by 14%, labor productivity increased by 8%, and the total investment increased by 2.3 billion forints.

Due to the achievements made in 1958, there were better conditions for construction in 1959. This year, the Central Committee's March resolution aroused enthusiastic response among the working masses. A nationwide labor emulation movement to welcome the Party Congress was launched extensively. The working people have completed 97% of the gift plan by the beginning of November. In the first three quarters of this year, in agriculture, we are completing the task of consolidating production cooperatives. Compared with the same period last year, industrial production increased by 12%, labor productivity increased by 4%, and the total monetary income of residents increased by 8%. The achievements in the first three quarters of this year show that we may be able to reach the 1960 level stipulated in the three-year plan in several major indicators one year ahead of schedule.

Kadar pointed out that the people's living standards have improved significantly since liberation. The people's living conditions are good now.

Kadar said that the people of our country need to complete the task of laying the foundation for socialism in the next few years and accelerate the building of a socialist society. Our direct task is to implement the plans for this year and next year, over fulfill the three-year plan, and thus create a higher and more reliable starting point for the new five-year plan. We should further develop industry, and we should ensure the faster development of heavy industry; at the same time, we must also vigorously develop light industry. In the next few years, we must make our entire national economy close to the economic level of the most developed countries. From the point of view of development, the decisive issue today is to eliminate the existing relative backwardness of agricultural production within the entire national economy.

Kadar emphasized that in order to ensure the faster development of the national economy, it is necessary to improve labor productivity, strengthen the planning of the national economy, continue to improve the system of wages and bonuses, and make material incentives conducive to the development of the national economy; at the same time, we must rely more on the enthusiasm, opinions, and passion of the masses in our work.

    On Cultural and Educational Issues

Kadar then talked about cultural and educational issues in the fourth part. After narrating the achievements made by Hungary in this regard in the past fifteen years, he said that although great achievements have been made on the cultural front, it is still relatively behind the achievements made in the political and economic fields. At present, the influence of counter-revolutionary riots and the incitement of revisionists in the ideological field can still be felt. At the same time, this also has its beneficial side: the struggle against counter-revolution on this front has strengthened the Marxist backbone of intellectuals and strengthened our scientific and artistic undertakings, which is also a great school for educating the masses.

Kadar pointed out that we absolutely require that science and art better serve the needs of the working class, the working masses, and socialist construction. It is necessary to overcome the ideological remnants left over from the capitalist system—nationalism, revisionism, and anti-Semitism—and make Marxist-Leninist ideology dominate in ideological awareness and scientific culture.

Kadar said that our education system must be reformed. We must resolutely transform our schools into socialist schools and make schools closer to life. In the new five-year plan, we must create the necessary conditions for the development of science and make scientific research adapt to the needs of our society.

He went on to say that the Party's policies and the influence of real life have promoted the ideological progress of writers and artists. However, some people are lagging behind the progressive situation. The people expect every writer and artist to express a clear attitude on the following issues, first of all in their own works: Whom to support in the class struggle? With whom to stand?

    The Socialist Transformation of Agriculture

In the fifth part of his report, Kadar talked about the socialist transformation of agriculture and other issues. He said that from the point of view of continuing to develop our country's socialist system, it is a decisive task to end the socialist transformation of agriculture in the next few years, thus laying the foundation of socialist society in our country. The Party and the working class must guide individual laboring peasants onto the socialist road through propaganda and education on the basis of ensuring the principle of voluntariness and help them in organizational and material aspects.

When talking about the policy towards the exploiting classes, Kadar said that some of the past exploiters and their supporters have adapted to our society, while others rose up against the people's regime in 1956 and still adopt a hostile attitude today. We will also treat those among them who have opposed our system as enemies. Whoever opposes our system must consider the power of the proletarian dictatorship. The suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion does not mean that the class struggle has stopped. Our goal—to complete the foundation of socialism and build socialism—is to be achieved through class struggle. Starting from the interests of socialism and our people, we do not demand the intensification of the class struggle. On the contrary, it would be a good thing if the intensity of the class struggle were to weaken and its form were less sharp. The Party and the people's regime will never promote the intensification of the class struggle. However, this does not depend on us first, but on our class enemies and international imperialism.

    On the Party, the Leading Role of the Party, Party-Mass Relations, and Mass Movements

In the last part of his report, Kadar talked about the Party, the leading role of the Party, Party-mass relations, and mass movements. Kadar said that Marxist-Leninist theory teaches us that without the Party, without the leadership of the Party, the working class cannot seize and maintain power, and without the leadership of the Party, it is impossible to build a socialist society. In order to defend the ideological basis of party unity and the purity of Marxist-Leninist thought, the Party has carried out a two-front struggle in the past three years, that is, the struggle against revisionism and the struggle against dogmatism. Dogmatism and revisionist tendencies that appear in the Party will damage the ideological weapons of the working class. Whether in Hungary or internationally, the main danger of these tendencies is revisionism. Modern revisionism revives the old bourgeois ideas that have not yet been overcome. It colludes with and relies on international imperialism and domestic reactionaries. It is particularly dangerous that modern revisionism always appears in front of the masses under the guise of Marxism-Leninism. Although revisionism has the most modern form, it is doomed to failure, just as all attacks against Marxism have failed for centuries. In this regard, the entire disgraceful history of our country's revisionist group is a clear example. A large part of this group has completely followed the path that revisionism is bound to take, from falsifying Marxist-Leninist theories to creating a split in the Party, and even finally throwing themselves into the camp of class enemies and betraying the motherland.

Kadar pointed out that in order to further improve the theoretical level of the Party and its members, we must continue to wage a resolute struggle against revisionism, dogmatism, and all kinds of views that distort Marxism-Leninism in the future.

Kadar said, "Now, we have 400,245 party members and 35,500 probationary party members. Although the number of our party members is only half of what it used to be, we still have the right to say that the Party is stronger than before the counter-revolutionary events. This is because: the anti-party factions and careerists who infiltrated the Party before 1956, as well as the hundreds of thousands of wavering people who used to be in the Party, are no longer in the Party. Today's party is truly a voluntary fighting alliance of people with consistent ideological principles. Now, the Leninist principles of party life and the principle of democratic centralism are being implemented in the Party. There is already unity, discipline, a free atmosphere, and freedom of criticism in the Party. The Party's style of work has also improved greatly in the past three years."

Finally, Kadar said that the Party's current task is to end the foundation-laying work of socialist society in the next few years. As the tasks of economic and cultural construction are better and faster resolved, the day when the socialist revolution will achieve a complete victory in our country will come sooner. The conditions for completing the above tasks are: to defend the purity of our ideological basis—Marxism-Leninism—within the Party, to creatively apply scientific theory, to implement a clear and firm communist policy, and to pay attention to thoroughness when implementing policies. In the future, the main firepower of the ideological struggle should be directed at the remnants of hostile bourgeois views and revisionist views. At the same time, we will not give in to dogmatism and sectarian activities in the future. The Party should rely more on the masses and make the masses more closely united around the Party. The Hungarian people must form closer friendships with the people of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, and must be more closely united with the increasingly powerful international socialist and peace forces. We are confident that the day when socialism will triumph in our country will come soon.

    卡达尔在匈牙利社会主义工人党代表大会上指出
    争取早日实现社会主义革命彻底胜利
    加强匈苏友谊和社会主义阵营团结　反对美帝国主义的干涉活动
    新华社布达佩斯30日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔，代表中央委员会向党的第七次代表大会作了报告。他在报告中首先指出，这次代表大会的任务是：总结党的斗争经验和提出今后的任务。中央委员会在工作中虽然还有缺点，但是可以毫无愧色地向代表大会报告工作，因为它所执行的政策已经被证明是正确的。只要把匈牙利三年前的严重形势同今天巩固的形势比较一下，我们就可以大胆地把这一总的成就认为是党、工人阶级、匈牙利人民和社会主义革命的历史性的胜利。卡达尔并且表示深切地感谢各国共产党和工人党、社会主义各国人民和世界进步人类所给予匈牙利的援助。
    外交政策和国际形势
    卡达尔接着在报告的第一部分中阐述了匈牙利外交政策和国际形势。他说，我国外交政策的目标是：保卫我国人民取得的巨大成果，保证社会主义的和平建设。我国外交政策的基本原则是：匈苏友好，忠实于社会主义阵营，反对帝国主义，不管社会制度的差异，同一切国家和人民和平共处。
    卡达尔说，在过去的十五年中，苏联两次以它的儿女的鲜血证明了它对匈牙利人民的深厚友谊和国际主义精神。它并通过各种方式帮助匈牙利人民医治战争创伤和进行社会主义建设。匈苏友谊是匈牙利人民力量的泉源、伟大的支柱和繁荣的保证。不断加强匈苏友谊，是我们党和政府对外政策的最主要任务。
    卡达尔指出，十年前中国人民的革命获得了胜利，继而进行了社会主义革命。这一事实大大改变了世界的政治面貌。一个拥有六亿五千万人口的国家，由半封建半殖民地的国家变成了社会主义的世界大国。它的榜样、它的空前发展速度，是令人振奋和鼓舞的。中国的榜样同时证明了社会主义制度的优越性和摆脱了压迫而获得解放的人民所具有的无限创造力。
    他说，以苏联为核心和领导力量的社会主义阵营，今天是世界进步和和平的主要力量，匈牙利外交政策的基础，今后仍然是加强社会主义阵营的力量和团结，坚决地击退一切旨在损害这一力量和团结的企图。
    卡达尔表示匈牙利希望扩大同摆脱殖民主义压迫的亚非国家的经济文化联系，对正在争取民族独立的各国人民表示同情。
    卡达尔说，匈牙利同北大西洋公约组织的领导国家及其政府之间的关系，是不能令人满意的。其中，我们特别同美国政府有着严重的矛盾。
    卡达尔揭露了美国企图颠复匈牙利人民政权和干涉匈牙利内政的一些事实。他说，美国反动集团企图利用联合国的反对匈牙利的决议来达到干涉我国内政的目的。每年围绕这一决议所煽起的可笑的反匈运动都是为反苏和“冷战”目的服务的，我们从不承认，将来也不会承认这一违反联合国宪章的非法决议。
    卡达尔说，在过去的两三年中，国际局势有了一定程度的缓和。产生这一变化的决定性原因是苏联、社会主义阵营、国际工人运动、世界和平运动力量的增长和和平政策。然而在资本主义国家和国际生活中进行活动、并起着影响的反和平势力也不容忽视。因此各国人民必需继续对反和平的势力进行坚决的斗争，迫使他们退却。
    卡达尔在指出赫鲁晓夫访美的成就后说，我们支持苏联提出的全面裁军的建议，我们主张通过逐渐扩大国际联系的形式实现和平共处。
    国内政治形势
    卡达尔在报告的第二部分谈到了匈牙利的国内政治形势。他说，在过去三年中，匈牙利国内政治形势的发展趋势是健康的。同反革命所进行的斗争锻炼了和团结了社会主义力量。广大群众在政治上大大进步了，并且在阶级斗争中取得了丰富的经验。在这个斗争的过程中，我国人民在社会主义思想的基础上的团结进一步加强了。
    卡达尔谈到了匈牙利1956年的反革命暴乱，并根据党中央委员会的意见详细分析了事件的性质和产生的原因。他说，以美国反动集团为首的国际帝国主义从匈牙利解放的第一天起就利用他们所拥有的一切工具，支持匈牙利人民的形形色色的敌人。多年来，帝国主义就唆使、煽动反革命暴乱，并且进行组织工作。最后，通过他们的代理人和政治同盟者纳吉·伊姆雷及其集团和国内的资产阶级反革命势力，终于发动了反革命暴乱，这样国内的反革命势力和国际的帝国主义势力两者彼此结成联盟，来反对匈牙利人民共和国。
    卡达尔说，党今后将长期注意到有关反革命暴乱的全部经验教训。但是，就反革命暴乱本身来说，在各方面都已经遭到了完全失败。目前国内政治形势的特点是稳定、巩固和迅速发展。人民政权比反革命暴乱前更加坚强了，社会主义基础大大扩大了，社会主义建设在顺利地蓬勃地进行。如果没有群众在政治上的支持和忘我的劳动，这种形势是不会形成的。
    卡达尔在报告中揭露了一些西方报刊和反动分子对匈牙利所制造的谣言和妄想。他说，有些反动分子把希望寄托在“苏联军队撤出匈牙利”上面。我们多次明确地表示，苏联军队将继续驻留在匈牙利，直到国际局势不需要这样做的时候为止。
    卡达尔说，匈牙利社会主义革命的力量和社会主义革命的拥护者已经学会了需要的东西，他们能够保卫我们的制度免受敌人的侵犯。我们吸取经验，不再重犯错误，我们不会忘记叛徒、阶级敌人和帝国主义者。在过去的经验的基础上，我们要进一步加强我们的人民国家和我国的制度。我们要继续加强工农联盟，在国家生活中贯彻民主集中制的原则。在加强国家集中领导的同时，继续扩大地方政权机关的权限。
    经济情况和经济建设面临的任务
    卡达尔在报告的第三部分谈到了关于匈牙利经济情况和经济建设方面面临的任务。他说，我国的经济形势可以说是好的。解放以来，我们在经济建设方面取得了伟大成就。从1949年到现在，我国建立了一百个大型工业企业，一些新型的社会主义工业城市诞生了，农业也有了发展，拖拉机已由1935年的七千台增加到今年的三万一千台。1938年每霍尔特土地的化肥施用量只有十三点五公斤，今年已提高到七十七公斤。
    反革命暴乱及其产生的破坏影响，使匈牙利人民蒙受了二百二十亿福林的损失。在全国人民的努力和社会主义国家的援助下，国民经济到1957年底已经得到恢复。接着，我们制定了经济工作的方针和发展国民经济的三年计划。在1958年，我们取得了良好的成绩。同1955年相比，1958年的国营工业生产增长14％，劳动生产率提高8％，投资总额增加了二十三亿福林。
    由于1958年取得的成就，1959年就有更好的条件来进行建设。今年，中央委员会的三月决议在劳动群众中引起了热烈的反应。全国广泛地开展了迎接党代会的劳动竞赛运动。劳动人民已在11月初完成了献礼计划的97％。在今年头三个季度中，在农业方面，我们正在完成巩固生产合作社的任务。与去年同期相比，工业生产增长12％，劳动生产率增长4％，居民货币总收入增加8％。今年头三季度的成绩表明，我们有可能提前一年在几项主要指标方面达到三年计划中规定的1960年的水平。
    卡达尔指出，解放后人民的生活水平有了显著的提高。目前人民的生活条件是良好的。
    卡达尔说，我国人民在最近几年内需要完成奠定社会主义基础的任务，并加速建成社会主义社会。我们的直接任务是实现今年和明年的计划，超额完成三年计划，从而为新五年计划创造更高的可靠的起点。我们应当进一步发展工业，应当保证重工业的更快发展；同时也要大力发展轻工业。今后几年中，要使我国整个国民经济接近最发达的国家的经济水平。从发展的观点来看，今天的决定性问题是要消除农业生产在整个国民经济内部现存的相对落后现象。
    卡达尔强调指出，为了保证国民经济的更快发展，必须提高劳动生产率，加强国民经济内部的计划性，继续改进关于工资和奖金的制度，使物质刺激有助于国民经济的发展；同时，在工作中要更好地依靠群众的积极性、意见和热情。
    有关文化、教育问题
    卡达尔接着在第四部分谈到了有关文化、教育问题。他在叙述了匈牙利十五年来在这方面所取得的成就后说，在文化战线上虽然获得了伟大成果，但是还相对地落后于在政治经济方面所取得的成就。目前仍然能感到反革命暴乱和修正主义者的煽惑在思想领域中的影响。同时，这也有它有利的一面：同反革命在这个战线上的斗争加强了知识分子中的马克思主义骨干分子，加强了我们的科学艺术事业，这也是教育群众的伟大的学校。
    卡达尔指出，我们绝对要求科学和艺术事业更好地面向工人阶级劳动群众和社会主义建设的需要，并为之服务。必须克服资本主义制度遗留下来的思想——民族主义、修正主义和反犹太主义的残余，必须使马克思列宁主义思想在思想意识和科学文化方面占统治地位。
    卡达尔说，我们的教育制度必须改革，必须坚决地把我们的学校改造成为社会主义性质的学校，使学校更加接近生活。在新的五年计划中，要为发展科学创造必要的条件，要使科学研究适应我国社会的需要。
    他接着说，党的政策和现实生活的影响，推动了作家艺术家的思想进步。但是，还有些人落后于进步的形势。人民期待每一个作家、艺术家首先在自己的作品中对下列问题表示明确态度：在阶级斗争中拥护什么人？同什么人站在一边？
    农业社会主义改造问题
    卡达尔在报告的第五部分中谈到了农业社会主义改造等问题。他说，从继续发展我国社会主义社会制度这个观点来看，在今后几年内结束农业的社会主义改造、从而在我国奠定社会主义社会的基础，是一个决定性的任务。党和工人阶级必须通过宣传教育，在保证自愿原则的基础上，把个体劳动农民引向社会主义的道路，并且在组织和物质方面帮助它们。
    卡达尔在谈到对剥削阶级的政策时说，一部分过去的剥削者及其支持者已经适应了我们的社会，另一部分则在1956年起来反对人民政权，而且今天也采取敌对态度。他们之中凡是反对过我国制度的人，我们也要把他们作为敌人来处理。谁要反对我国制度，谁就要考虑到无产阶级专政的威力。反革命叛乱的平息，并不意味着阶级斗争已经停止。我们的目标——完成社会主义的奠基工作和建成社会主义——是要通过阶级斗争来实现的。从社会主义和我国人民的利益出发，并不要求阶级斗争尖锐化。相反，如果阶级斗争的激烈程度有所减弱，其形式不太尖锐，倒是件好事。党和人民政权决不促使阶级斗争尖锐化。但是，这首先不取决于我们，而是取决于我们的阶级敌人和国际帝国主义。
    关于党、党的领导作用、党群关系和群众运动
    卡达尔在报告的最后一部分谈到了关于党、党的领导作用、党群关系和群众运动等问题。卡达尔说，马克思列宁主义学说教导我们，没有党、没有党的领导，工人阶级就不可能夺取和保住政权，没有党的领导，就不可能建成社会主义社会。为了捍卫党内团结的思想基础，为了马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁性，党在过去的三年中进行了两条战线的斗争，即反对修正主义和反对教条主义的斗争。党内出现的教条主义和修正主义倾向会损害工人阶级的思想武器。不论在匈牙利或是在国际上，这些倾向中的主要危险是修正主义。现代修正主义复活了尚未克服的旧的资产阶级思想，它勾结并依靠国际帝国主义和国内反动派。特别危险的是现代修正主义总是披着马克思列宁主义的外衣出现在群众面前。修正主义虽然具有最现代化的形式，但正如百年来所有反对马克思主义的进攻都遭到了失败一样，它也是要失败的。在这方面，我国修正主义集团的全部不光彩的历史，就是一个清楚的例证。这个集团中的很大一部分人，从伪造马克思列宁主义学说起一直发展到制造党的分裂，甚至最后投入阶级敌人的阵营，背叛祖国，全部地走完了修正主义所必然走的道路。
    卡达尔指出，要进一步提高党和党员的理论水平，就要求我们在今后仍然要对修正主义、教条主义和各种各样的歪曲马克思列宁主义的观点进行坚决的斗争。
    卡达尔说，现在，我们有四十万零二千四百五十六名党员、三万五千五百名预备党员。尽管我们党员的人数只有过去的一半，但是我们仍然有权利说党比反革命事件前强大了。这是因为：1956年前混进党内的反党派别和野心分子，以及过去党内的几十万动摇不定的人，已经不在党内了。今天的党真正是那些思想原则一致的人们的自愿的战斗联盟。现在，党内实现着党的生活的列宁原则、民主集中制的原则。党内已经有了团结、纪律、自由空气和批评的自由。党的工作作风在过去三年内也有了很大改进。
    卡达尔最后说，党当前的任务是在最近几年内，结束社会主义社会的奠基工作，随着经济和文化建设任务得到更好更快的解决，使社会主义革命在我国取得彻底胜利的日子早日到来。完成上述任务的条件是：在党内保卫我们的思想基础——马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，要创造性地运用科学理论，执行明确、坚定的共产主义的政策，在执行政策时，要注意彻底性。今后思想斗争的主要火力应指向敌对的资产阶级观点和修正主义观点的残余。同时，今后我们也不向教条主义和宗派活动让步。党应该更好地依靠群众，使群众更加紧密地团结在党的周围。匈牙利人民必须同苏联和社会主义各国人民结成更亲密的友谊，必须更加紧密地同日益强大的国际社会主义和和平力量团结在一起。我们确信，社会主义在我国胜利的日子很快就会来到的。
