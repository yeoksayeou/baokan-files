    Vanguard of the Working Class
    By Our Correspondent Wang Chongjie
    Hungary has achieved brilliant success in socialist construction. When talking about these great victories, people always say that they are inseparable from the heroic struggle and selfless labor of millions of Communist Party members. Before the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, I interviewed an ordinary party member, Comrade Halák, an old worker at the Budapest Shipyard. He was recently elected as a delegate to the "Seventh Congress" at the Budapest Party Congress.
    In the spring of 1945, when the guns of the Soviet Red Army liberating Budapest were still roaring, and when the Hitler and Horthy bandits were still struggling frantically, Halák broke out of the fascist prison and joined the ranks of the working class vanguard with a fiery heart. Halák was still very excited when he mentioned this event fifteen years ago. He said: "A prisoner who was about to be killed in a fascist prison regained his freedom, a poor worker found the Party, and after a long night, finally saw the dawn of a new life. I will never forget the moment when that new life began."
    This ordinary shipyard worker was arrested and imprisoned in 1944 for opposing the fascist war of aggression and demanding improvement of the people's living conditions. However, the cruel prison life did not dampen Halák's courage to fight. On the contrary, under the influence of other revolutionary fighters in prison, he became more aware of the truth and the path for the working class to strive for liberation.
    After the long war, Hungary was in a very difficult period. The shelling destroyed factories, bridges, railways and houses, the fields were barren, and the people were plunged into hunger and cold. The Communists undertook the great and arduous historical mission of building a new life on the ruins of the war. Under the leadership of the Party, Halák worked day and night to carry out propaganda and organizational work. After returning to the shipyard, he immediately started to organize workers to build factory buildings and resume production. At that time, after a day of hard work, all he could get for dinner was a little corn soup. In order to let the children eat a little more, Halák was reluctant to drink even the corn soup. The little bit of black bread he brought to work during the day was often shared with other workers, and he preferred to endure more hunger, and he always looked for the heaviest work when working. At that time, all kinds of bourgeois parties and enemies at home and abroad were carrying out conspiracies at any time and any place in an attempt to strangle the young People's Republic. However, based on a high sense of ownership of the new society, this worker with an iron will never flinched in the face of difficulties. He gave others fire and warmth, guiding everyone to see the happy tomorrow clearly through the temporary difficulties. Under his influence, the worker brothers resolutely fought against the enemy, and their enthusiasm for labor became more and more vigorous day by day. Later, in order to strengthen the Party's work in the countryside, this shipyard worker was sent to a village near the capital to serve as the secretary of the Party branch. Wherever the Communists went, they ignited the fire of struggle for justice and socialism. He mobilized the masses to fight against the sabotage activities of landlords and rich peasants. The enemy tried every possible means to buy off this vanguard member of the working class, but Halák never wavered for personal gain.
    After a period of time, Halák returned to the Budapest Shipyard. Due to family poverty in his childhood, he had never set foot in the school gate. After liberation, Halák attended night schools and tutoring classes, worked hard, and gradually became a person who could read and write and had cultural and theoretical knowledge. He constantly studied his profession and soon became a very skilled technical worker. Due to his outstanding labor achievements, he was successively awarded the honorary titles of Excellent Laborer and Stakhanov Worker during the first five-year plan. Always taking the lead in overcoming difficulties and never caring about personal gains and losses, these noble qualities have given Halák a very high prestige among the masses. He was successively elected as the secretary of the Party grassroots organization, and the branch he led was often rated as an excellent Party organization.
    During the counter-revolutionary rebellion in 1956, the enemy was rampant for a while. At that time, a group of counter-revolutionaries in the shipyard shouted at Halák with guns in their hands: "You stubborn Communists must honestly get out of the factory, otherwise don't even think about living!" Halák seemed very angry when he described the situation to us at that time. He said: "Can you succumb to the enemy's threats? No! I have worked in this factory for more than 30 years. After liberation, the worker brothers have exhausted their efforts to restore and develop production, and we must not let the enemy destroy this large shipbuilding enterprise, which is very important to the motherland." This old worker and Communist Party member took up arms with other comrades and guarded the factory day and night. During the tense period, he did not go home for seven or eight days in a row. When the workers' picket team began to be organized, he immediately joined the picket team, working while holding weapons to protect the achievements of socialist construction. Halák was also elected as a people's judge in the capital, and resolutely exposed and punished counter-revolutionaries in court.
    After the Hungarian Party Central Committee issued a call to accelerate socialist construction in March of this year, Halák immediately organized a labor competition in the workshop. This experienced technical worker often forgot to eat and sleep in order to engage in technical innovation. He also worked with engineers to study measures to increase production and save resources. In addition to overfulfilling his own tasks, he also tried his best to pass on his experience to young workers. Therefore, in the workshop where Comrade Halák worked, everyone had completed the main indicators stipulated in the three-year plan one year ahead of schedule.
    The actions of this ordinary Communist Party member and shipyard worker fully reflect what he said: "The vanguard of the working class is the most honorable and sacred title for me. As long as I live, I will work tirelessly with both hands to build the magnificent edifice of communism."

### 工人阶级的先锋队员

    工人阶级的先锋队员
    本报记者　王崇杰
    匈牙利社会主义建设已取得了辉煌的成就。在谈到这些巨大的胜利时，人们总是说这是同千万共产党员的英勇斗争和忘我劳动分不开的。在社会主义工人党第七次代表大会召开前，记者访问了一个普通的党员——布达佩斯造船厂的老工人郝拉克同志。不久前他在布达佩斯党代表会议上当选为参加“七大”的代表。
    1945年春天，当苏联红军解放布达佩斯的炮火刚刚轰鸣的时候，当希特勒和霍尔蒂匪徒还在疯狂挣扎的时候，郝拉克冲出了法西斯的牢狱，怀着一颗烈火般的心，加入了工人阶级先锋队的行列。郝拉克提起十五年前的这段事，依然非常激动。他说：“一个在法西斯牢狱中将要被杀害的囚徒重新获得了自由，一个苦命的工人找到了党，经过漫漫长夜，终于看到了新生活的曙光。我永远忘不了那新生命开始的时刻。”
    这个普通的造船工人，是在1944年因为反对法西斯的侵略战争、要求改善人民生活而被捕入狱的。但残酷的监狱生活并没有挫伤郝拉克斗争的勇气，相反地，在狱中其他革命战士的影响下，他更认清了真理和工人阶级争取解放的道路。
    在长期的战争之后，匈牙利处在非常困难的时期。炮火破坏了工厂，炸毁了桥梁、铁路和住宅，田野荒芜，人民陷入饥寒交迫的境地。共产党人承担了在战争废墟上建设新生活的伟大而艰巨的历史使命。郝拉克在党的领导下日夜不停地奔走，开展了宣传组织工作。他回到造船厂后立即着手组织工人修建厂房，恢复生产。当时在一天紧张的劳动之后，晚上回家只能喝到一点用玉米做的汤。为了让孩子们能多吃到一点，郝拉克连玉米汤也舍不得喝。他白天上班带着的一点黑面包，也常分给别的工人吃，自己宁肯多挨点饿，而工作时他总是找最重的活干。那时形形色色的资产阶级政党和国内外的敌人又随时随地都在进行阴谋活动，企图绞杀年轻的人民共和国。但基于新社会高度的主人翁感，这位有着钢铁意志的工人在困难面前从没有气馁。他给别人火和热，引导大家透过暂时困难的云雾看清楚幸福的明天。在他的影响下，工人兄弟们坚决同敌人进行了斗争，劳动干劲也一天比一天足。后来为了加强党在农村的工作，这位造船工人被派到首都附近的一个村庄担任党支部书记。共产党人走到哪里便在哪里燃起为正义、为社会主义而斗争的烈火。他发动群众同地主富农的破坏活动进行斗争。敌人曾想尽一切办法，打算收买这位工人阶级的先锋队员，但郝拉克一直没有为了个人的私利而动摇过。
    经过一段时间，郝拉克又返回布达佩斯造船厂。童年由于家庭贫困，他从来没有踏上过学校的大门。解放后，郝拉克上夜校和补习班，刻苦用功，逐渐成为一个能读能写、有文化理论修养的人。他不断钻研业务，很快成为一个非常熟练的技术工人。由于杰出的劳动成绩，第一个五年计划期间他曾先后获得优秀劳动者和斯达哈诺夫工作者的光荣称号。永远以身作则克服困难，从不计较个人得失，这些高贵的品质使郝拉克在群众中享有极高的威信。他接连被选为党基层组织的书记，他领导的支部也常被评为优秀的党组织。
    1956年反革命叛乱时，敌人曾猖狂一时。当时在造船厂一群反革命分子曾手持着枪向郝拉克叫嚷道：“你们这些顽固的共产党员要老老实实地滚出工厂去，否则就别想再活下去！”郝拉克向我们叙述当时的情况时，显得非常气愤。他说：“能在敌人的威胁下屈服吗？不能！我在这个工厂工作了三十多年。解放后工人兄弟们用尽心血恢复发展了生产，决不能让敌人破坏这个对祖国非常重要的大型造船企业。”这位老工人、共产党员同其他同志一起拿起了武器，日夜守卫着工厂。在紧张时期他一连七八天没有回家。当开始组织工人纠察队时，他立即参加了纠察队，一面劳动，一面手持武器保卫社会主义建设的成果。郝拉克并被选为首都的人民审判员，在法庭上坚决揭发和制裁了反革命分子。
    今年3月，匈牙利党中央发出加速社会主义建设的号召后，郝拉克立即在车间组织了劳动竞赛。这位经验丰富的技术工人，为了搞技术革新，常常废寝忘食。他还同工程师们一道研究增产节约的措施。除自己超额完成任务外，并尽力把自己的经验传授给年青的工人。所以在郝拉克同志工作的车间，大家已提前一年完成了三年计划规定的主要指标。
    这位普通的共产党员和造船工人的行动，充分体现出了他所说的这句话：“工人阶级的先锋队员对我讲来是最荣誉和神圣的称号。只要活一天，我就要双手不停地为建造共产主义的宏伟大厦而奋斗。”
