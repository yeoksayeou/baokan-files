Livestock Farm Director

Zhao Jialu

　　Xu Laofu, the director of the livestock farm of the Chenxu Production Team, returned from the special district's leap forward conference on developing pig production. He dashed down the slope by the river and stepped onto the Tongma Dyke.

　　The north wind, carrying the scent of soil, whistled through. Large fields of ripe cotton, like a giant, thick velvet blanket, covered the land within the dike. Suddenly, a patch of lush, glossy wheat field, planted in the middle of the brown cotton fields, lit up Xu Laofu's eyes! He remembered that it was the day before he left for the special district conference that he pulled up the cotton stalks and sowed the wheat seeds; but now tender seedlings more than two inches high had sprouted. Xu Laofu couldn't help but praise, "Such good crops!" He smacked his lips, "How could they not be good? Five hundred dan of pig manure per mu!" He smacked his lips even louder, more crisply than children's feather whistles, not knowing whether he was praising the wheat or the pig manure that fertilized the fields?

　　Xu Laofu went straight to the livestock farm at the head of the village. As soon as he entered, he saw Xiao Dazi waving a broom, jumping and twisting as he cleaned the pigsty. Another middle-aged man in a gray cotton-padded jacket was hunched over, mixing pig feed. Xu Laofu knew at a glance that this was Yue Dasheng, the Party branch secretary of the brigade. He rushed forward and said, "What are you mixing, Secretary Yue?" Yue Dasheng put down the iron spoon and said with a smile, "You're back! We didn't lose face at the special district conference, did we?"

　　Xu Laofu said, "We didn't lose face, but we're traveling eight hundred li a day, while others are traveling a thousand li a day, faster!" He said, taking out a stack of mimeographed materials, "Look! The Yuexi's initiative."

　　Xiao Dazi, quick-eyed and quick-handed, snatched it up and read it aloud, then shouted, "Heavens, such high targets!"

　　Xu Laofu said, "That's still less! The Labang Commune is truly ambitious!"

　　Xiao Dazi became anxious, jumping three feet high, and said, "Good grandfather Laofu! Labang, Labang! Just how big is Labang's appetite?"

　　Xu Laofu said calmly, "Labang is twice as high as Yuexi!"

　　Yue Dasheng, who was standing next to him, couldn't restrain himself either. He waved his hand and said, "Hold a general meeting tonight. Your livestock farm should first calculate a base!"

　　Xu Laofu said, "Then how high a target can we set, Secretary Yue?"

　　Yue Dasheng laughed and said, "Set as high a target as you have enthusiasm! Isn't the situation obvious? With the Party's strong leadership, the prestige of the people's commune, and the experience of running the farm for a year," he paused and said, "With the team's 100% promotion faction! Even Ren Laohai has become a pig-raising pioneer! Can we easily let others carry away this red flag of developing pig production?"

　　Speaking of Ren Laohai, there's a story to tell!

　　A year ago, when the Chenxu Team's livestock farm was first established, this Ren Laohai was an outright opponent of pig raising. In terms of labor and love for the collective, he was no worse than others, but for some reason, he was at odds with pigs, shouting at meetings and privately: "Don't you see what time it is? We can't even handle the proper farm work, and you have the leisure to play with pigs?"

　　Xu Laofu and Ren Laohai had worked together for the landlord since they were young, been beaten by the same whip, and eaten from the same broken bowl of chaff. Xu Laofu was a lonely old man, and Ren Laohai's home became his home during the New Year and festivals. But today, on the issue of pig raising, they were on opposite sides, like fire and water.

　　Day one:

　　Xu Laofu: "Pigs are a treasure, crops can't do without them, I don't need to say it, you understand."

　　Ren Laohai: "If you don't farm, you don't eat; if you don't raise pigs, I think we can still live!"

　　Xu Laofu: "Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, can our commune do without any of them?"

　　Ren Laohai: "But there must be priorities! Can't you see how tight the farm work is?"

　　Day two:

　　Xu Laofu: "The others elected me to be the director! You have to help me out."

　　Ren Laohai: "In my opinion, it's better not to be director, hard times are waiting for you!"

　　Xu Laofu: "Aren't you ashamed to say that? Have you forgotten who we are? We are members of the people's commune!"

　　Ren Laohai: "Are you senile? No pigsty, no manpower, the dead of winter, where are you going to find feed? Do you have three heads and six arms?"

　　Xu Laofu: "With the Party, with the masses, even if the sky falls, we can hold it up."

　　Day three:

　　Xu Laofu: "Raising pigs is good for the commune, if you don't raise them, so be it! Why are you still pouring cold water on it?"

　　Ren Laohai: "If you are doing good for the commune, aren't I? If raising pigs loses money, who will bear this bad debt?"

　　Xu Laofu roared: "I will raise them! I will guarantee them! I will compensate for them!"

　　Xu Laofu ran back to his small room, slammed the door shut, rolled up his bedding, and moved to the pig farm to settle down. As luck would have it, that night, a pregnant sow that was due to deliver was about to give birth! Xiao Dazi held a kerosene lamp, staring intently at Xu Laofu, who was helping the pig give birth. The old man smacked his lips, Xiao Dazi counted the beats, chanting in unison: "One is a money tree, two are bright pearls, three are treasure troves, four... five... ten," the tenth piglet opened its small, black, and bright eyes, shy and particularly endearing. Xu Laofu gently put it down on the ground. Huh! Why isn't it moving? Xiao Dazi panicked, Xu Laofu was covered in sweat, both anxious and angry, and cursed: "Xiao Dazi! You've lost your soul! Sugar water! Quick! Quick!"

　　After being fed sugar water, the piglet slowly opened its eyes, Xu Laofu was so happy that he smacked his lips repeatedly, hurriedly took off his cotton-padded jacket, wrapped it tightly around the piglet, held it in his arms, humming and singing, making a commotion all night long. According to Xiao Dazi afterwards: "Grandpa Laofu coaxed pigs better than women coaxed children!"

　　The coldest days of winter arrived, and it snowed heavily. One morning, Yue Dasheng, as usual, walked into the livestock farm and saw Xiao Dazi drooping his head, silently sweeping the pigsty. Xu Laofu was sitting blankly on a pile of straw, as if he hadn't seen the incoming brigade secretary. Yue Dasheng quietly asked, "What's wrong, Xiao Dazi?" Xiao Dazi said with a mournful face, "Squeezed to death... two... piglets!" Yue Dasheng approached the old man and shouted, "Grandpa Laofu!" He shouldn't have shouted! With this shout, Xu Laofu's tears burst out!

　　Yue Dasheng left the livestock farm and immediately convened an emergency meeting of the Chenxu Party branch. The meeting unanimously agreed that the primary task was to resolutely criticize right-leaning thoughts and mobilize all commune members to solve the livestock farm's problems with a fighting attitude.

　　That evening, a meeting of commune members was held, with two items on the agenda: first, what are the benefits of raising pigs? Second, how to run the livestock farm well.

　　Everyone spoke at once, making a racket.

　　But how to run the livestock farm well? No one answered anymore. At this time, Xu Laofu stood up from the crowd. The old man said, "I'll only say one benefit of raising pigs: in the spring, the fertilizer for our team's cotton fields and wheat fields will all be contracted by our livestock farm. As for difficulty, what isn't difficult? Isn't it difficult to build socialism?"

　　Before the old man sat down, Yue Dasheng took over: "Grandpa Laofu is right, what kind of difficulties can stump our people's commune? If there aren't enough pigsties, can't we build them? If the management isn't good enough, can't we establish a system of responsibility for contracting work and guaranteeing tasks? Speaking of the lack of concentrated feed, can't we build a feed processing factory!? I propose: immediately organize a shock brigade to build pigsties and a processing factory." A girl with a big braid suddenly stood up and said, "Grandpa Laofu! I'm not afraid of difficulties, take me as a livestock feeder!" "Take me!" "Take me!" Young people made requests one after another.

　　Just as it was getting noisy, the sound of an ox cart came from outside, it turned out that Secretary Li of the commune Party committee had personally come to deliver peanut shells to us. Everyone rushed to the door, leaving only Ren Laohai.

　　After the meeting, Secretary Li personally led the construction of pigsties and feed processing plants. Xu Laofu led the girls to try making peanut shell powder. The peanut shell powder, after being ground, baked, and thoroughly cooked, was a delight to watch the pigs eat with such gusto, grunting and shaking their heads, truly delicious!

　　Every evening after work, the people delivering feed lined up in a long line, "Thirty catties of wormwood stalks!" "Forty catties of water chestnut vegetables!" Under the lamp, Xiao Dazi, holding a pencil, always had to urge again and again, "What are we eating tomorrow?" Xu Laofu, with a dry cigarette in his mouth, said slowly, "Think again! Think again! Do you think this is easier than hosting a banquet?"

　　In the spring, "veterinarian" Xiao Dazi returned from studying in the county! His demeanor had also changed: "Director Xu! It's time to give vaccinations today!" Or: "Comrade Director! Sow No. 126 must be fed concentrated feed today! Note! Feed concentrated feed!" However, when no one was around, Xu Laofu still couldn't help but twist his ear: "Xiao Dazi! You've lost your soul! Why did you only grind the soybean leaves once today?"

　　Sows had piglets, piglets became big pigs, and the family grew and multiplied! Large numbers of high-quality fattening pigs, breeding pigs, and piglets were transferred from the Chenxu Livestock Farm to various production teams in the commune, and to the national market. According to Xiao Dazi: "The pigs in our livestock farm have daily competition and evaluation meetings every night. No. 148 says 'I gained three catties of meat today!' No. 299 says 'I gave birth to eighteen in one litter today!' Hey! It's so lively! However, people who don't have a relationship with them can't hear it, and even if you hear it, you won't understand it!"

　　One day, Xiao Dazi rushed into the pigsty in a rage and grabbed Xu Laofu: "I finally caught you!"

　　Xu Laofu widened his eyes and said, "Caught what?"

　　Xiao Dazi said, "Didn't you say that the warehouse has been closing accounts recently, and the feed that comes in every day is more than what's on the books? Sigh! I suspected someone, so today I hid behind the door, waiting! Waiting! Finally, it came! That person is very agile! First stepped over the leg, then poked in a head, and with a whoosh, a basket of water chestnut vegetables was dumped, and then they ran away! Guess who it is? Ha! It turns out to be Grandpa Ren Laohai! This old man is singing the fairy descending to earth play with us!"

　　Xu Laofu felt like he had drunk a cup of mellow wine, dizzy for a moment, and then calmed down, without saying a word, he strode away. He ran straight to Ren Laohai's house. The two old men, looked at each other, and at the same time, their four eyes were moistened. Ren Laohai wanted to say a few words to blame himself, say a few words to praise the livestock farm, say a few words..., but in the end, he said nothing, shivering for a long time before blurting out three words: "Old brother!"

　　………

　　Ah! Ah! How far the conversation has strayed! Now it's time to return to the Chenxu Team's leap forward conference on developing pig production! As soon as Xu Laofu's report was finished, the whole room exploded like cooked beans! This one said: "Oppose conservative thinking!" That one said: "We must catch up with Yuexi!"

　　According to usual practice, the concluding remarks were always made by the Party branch secretary or the team leader, but today the conclusion of the meeting was made by Ren Laohai. Ren Laohai said: "In the past, I was confused, but after this year of communization, I can be considered to have truly opened my eyes. I have figured out a principle: with the Party's leadership in everything, and with our people's commune in everything, nothing is impossible! Nothing can't be done well! I propose: our 1960 pig development targets must exceed Labang!" Before he finished speaking, everyone in the room raised their hands in unison.

　　Xu Laofu smacked his lips loudly, happily spreading out a large piece of red paper. Xiao Dazi quickly poured water to grind the ink, Yue Dasheng grabbed a wolf hair brush, dipped it fully in thick ink, and wrote: "All members of the Chenxu Production Team guarantee to the Party: the number of pigs developed in 1960 will exceed Labang by one time!" The character "pig" was written thick and full, thick and large, it was simply a round, plump, fat pig! No! It was simply a livestock farm squatting full of pigs, big and small! No! It was simply a picture of ten thousand heads of fat pigs swarming in the pen!

    饲养场场长
    赵家騄
    陈圩生产队饲养场场长徐老福，参加专区发展生猪跃进大会回来，扑登登跑过江边的一段斜坡，跨上同马大堤。
    偏北风夹着泥土的香味呼哨穿过。大片的熟透了的棉田，像一块巨大厚实的绒毯，覆盖在圩内的土地上。猛然，插在褐色棉田中间的一片绿葱葱、油晶晶的麦地，照亮了徐老福的眼睛！他记得是临去专区开会的前一天，才拔起棉秸，撒下麦种的；可现在却冒出两寸多高的嫩苗了。徐老福不由得称赞起来：“多好的庄稼啊！”他咂着嘴，“怎么能不好呢？一亩地五百担猪粪哪！”他更响亮的咂着嘴，比孩子们吹的鸡毛哨还清脆，不知道究竟是称赞小麦，还是称赞肥田的猪粪？
    徐老福直奔村头的饲养场。一进门，就看见小达子正挥舞着扫把，又跳又扭的打扫猪圈。另一个穿灰棉袄的中年人，佝偻着腰在搅拌猪食。徐老福一看就知道这是大队党支部书记岳大生。他抢上两步，说：“拌的什么食呀？岳书记！”岳大生放下铁勺，笑着说：“回来啦！专区大会，咱没丢脸吧！？”
    徐老福说：“脸是没丢，可咱们日行八百，人家日走千里，更快呀！”说着掏出一叠油印品：“瞧！岳西的倡议书。”
    小达子眼明手快，一把抢过，大声念了一遍，就嚷起来：“天呀，这么高的指标！”
    徐老福说：“这还是少的呐！那来榜公社才真叫有志气哩？”
    小达子急了，一跳三尺，说：“好老福大爷！来榜，来榜！来榜可到底有多大口气呀？”
    徐老福不慌不忙地说：“来榜呀，比岳西还高一倍哩！”
    站在旁边的岳大生，也捺不住性子了，手一挥，说：“晚上开大会，你们饲养场先盘算个底子吧！”
    徐老福说：“那咱们能订多高的指标呢？岳书记！”
    岳大生哈哈大笑，说：“有多大干劲就订多大指标呗！形势不是明摆着的么！有党的坚强领导，有人民公社的声威，有一年来的办场经验，”他顿了顿，说：“有全队百分之百的促进派！连任老海也变成养猪先锋啦！这面发展生猪生产的大红旗，能轻易让旁人扛走不成！？”
    提到任老海，可就有书说啦！
  一年前，当陈圩队饲养场刚刚建立的时候，这任老海是个不折不扣的养猪反对派。论劳动、论爱社，他并不比人差，不知为什么偏偏跟猪呕上气，会上也嚷，私下也嚷：“也不看看什么时候，正经庄稼活都忙不过来，还有闲情摆弄猪？”
    徐老福和任老海从小就在一块帮地主扛活，挨过一条鞭子的打，吃过一个破碗里的糠。徐老福是个孤老头子，过年过节，任老海的家就成了他的家。可今天，在养猪问题上，却各走一端，水火不容。
    第一天：
    徐老福：“猪是一个宝，庄稼少不了，这话我不讲，你也懂。”
    任老海：“不种田，没饭吃；不养猪，我看照样能活！”
    徐老福：“农、林、牧、副、渔，你说那一桩咱公社少得了？”
    任老海：“可也有个主次呀！你看不见农活这样紧？”
    第二天：
    徐老福：“大伙选我当场长啦！你得帮我一把。”
    任老海：“依我看，不当也罢，苦日子在后头等你呢！”
    徐老福：“你说这话也不害羞，你忘记咱们是什么人啦！咱们是人民公社的社员！”
    任老海：“你老昏啦！没猪圈、没人手，十冬腊月，你到哪里去找饲料？你长了三头六臂是咋的？”
    徐老福：“有党，有群众，天坍下来，咱也能顶住。”
    第三天：
    徐老福：“养猪是为公社好，你不养，算咧！凭什么还泼冷水？”
    任老海：“你为公社好，我不为公社好？养猪赔了本，归谁认这本烂账？”
    徐老福大吼一声：“归我养！归我保！归我赔！”
    徐老福奔回自己的小屋，把门喀当一锁，卷起铺盖，搬到猪场安家落户。说也真巧，当天夜里，一头足月的猪娘动胎了！小达子提着马灯，直瞪瞪的瞅着给猪接生的徐老福。老汉咂嘴，小达子数板，抑扬顿挫地合唱道：“一头摇钱树呀，二头夜明珠呀，三头聚宝盆呀，四头……五头……十头”，第十头小猪睁开又黑又亮的小眼睛，怯生生地格外惹人疼爱。徐老福轻轻地把它放下地。咦！怎么不动啦？小达子慌了手脚，徐老福满头大汗，又急又恨，骂：“小达子！你魂掉啦！红糖水！快！快！”
    灌过红糖水，小猪慢悠悠地睁开眼睛，徐老福乐得咂嘴连声，慌忙脱下身上的棉袄，紧紧裹住，抱在怀里，又哼又唱，足足闹腾了一整夜。据小达子事后说：“老福大爷哄猪，比妇女哄孩子还好听哩！”
    数九天到了，大雪纷飞。一天清晨，岳大生跟往常一样，走进饲养场，只见小达子搭拉着脑袋，不声不响地扫猪窝，徐老福痴呆呆地坐在稻草堆上，好像没看见进来的大队书记。岳大生悄悄地问：“出什么事啦！小达子？”小达子哭丧着脸，说：“挤死……两头……小猪！”岳大生靠近老汉，喊：“老福大爷！”不喊罢咧！这一喊呀！徐老福的眼泪噗噗直掉起来啦！
    岳大生离开饲养场，立时召开陈圩党支部紧急会议。会议一致认为：首要的任务是坚决批判右倾思想，发动全体社员以战斗姿态，解决饲养场问题。
    当天晚上，开社员大会，会的内容两个，第一养猪有什么好处？第二怎样办好饲养场。
    大家你一言我一语，嚷成一片。
    可怎样办好饲养场呢？再也没人答腔了。这时徐老福从人丛中站起来。老汉说：“养猪的好处我只说一宗，开春，咱队棉田、麦地的肥料，全归咱饲养场包干啦。说到难，什么事不难？难就不建设社会主义啦！？”
    老汉没落座，岳大生接过话来：“老福大爷说得对，什么样的困难，能难倒咱们人民公社？猪圈不够，不能盖？管理不周，不能建立包工包管责任制？说到缺乏精饲料，不能建立饲料加工厂！？我提议：立即组织一个突击队，立即盖猪圈盖加工厂。”旁边一个大辫子姑娘陡地站起，说：“老福大爷！我不怕难，收我当名饲养员吧！”“收我！”“收我！”青年人纷纷提出要求。
    正闹哄哩，屋外传来吆喝牛车的声音，原来是公社党委李书记亲自给咱送花生壳来了，大伙齐往门外涌，就只剩下任老海。
    散会以后，李书记亲自率领，赶隔猪圈和兴建饲料加工厂。徐老福带着姑娘们试制花生壳粉，经过碾细、焙焦、煮透的花生壳粉呀！你瞧猪吃的那股憨劲，哼哼唧唧，摇头晃脑，真是有滋有味呀！
    天天傍晚收工，送饲料的人排成一字长蛇阵，“蒿禾秸子三十斤！”“菱角菜四十斤！”灯下，小达子拿着铅笔，总要催一遍又一遍：“明天该吃什么呀？”徐老福含着旱烟，慢悠悠地说：“再想想！再想想！你当这比办桌酒席容易哩！”
    春天，“兽医”小达子从县里学习回来了！讲话的神情也变了：“徐场长！今天该打防疫针了！”再不就是：“场长同志！126号猪娘，今天得喂精料！注意！喂精料！”不过，逢到没人的时候，徐老福仍然少不了要拧他的耳朵：“小达子！你魂掉啦！今天的黄豆叶子，为什么只碾一道？”
    母猪下小猪，小猪变大猪，子孙满堂，越滚越多！大批优良的肥猪、种猪、仔猪从陈圩饲养场输送给公社的各个生产队，输送给国家市场。按小达子的说法：“咱饲养场的猪，天天晚上都有竞赛评比会。148号说‘今天我长肉三斤！’299号说‘今天我一胎生十八个！’嘿！可热闹啦！不过，跟它们没交情的人，别想听到，让你听，你也听不懂！”
    有一天，小达子气急败坏地跑进猪圈，一把抓住徐老福：“可让我逮住啦！”
    徐老福圆睁眼睛，说：“逮住什么了？”
    小达子说：“你不说最近仓库结账，日日进的饲料，都比账上多吗？咳！我就疑心到一个人，今天我藏在门后，等呀！等呀！到底等来了！那人手脚可灵巧哩！先跨进支腿，后探进个脑袋，一筐菱角菜哗啦一倒，拔脚就跑啦！你猜是谁？哈！原来是任老海大爷！这老汉跟咱唱起仙女临凡这台戏啦！”
    徐老福像喝了杯醇酒，昏眩一阵，定过神来，一言不发，飞步而去。一直跑到任老海家里。两位老人，你看我，我看你，四只眼睛同时润湿了。任老海想说几句责备自己的话，说几句赞扬饲养场的话，说几句……，但结果什么也没说，哆嗦半天，才迸出三个字：“老哥哥！”
        ………
    唉！唉！话扯得多远哪！现在该回到陈圩队发展生猪跃进大会上来了！徐老福的传达报告刚说完，满屋子就像爆熟了的豆子炸开啦！这个说：“反对保守思想！”那个说：“一定要赶上岳西！”
    按平常惯例，最后做总结的，总是党支书或队长，可今天会议的总结，却是任老海做的。任老海说：“过去我迷糊，经过公社化这一年，我算真正睁开了眼睛，我想通了一个道理：万事有了党领导，万事有咱人民公社，没有办不到的！没有办不好的！我提议：咱们1960年生猪发展指标，一定要超过来榜！”话未落音，满屋子人，唰地一下举起手来。
    徐老福响亮的咂着嘴，满心欢喜地摊开一张大红纸，小达子赶紧倒水研墨，岳大生抓起一支狼毫笔，饱饱地沾上满笔浓墨，写道：“陈圩生产队全体社员向党保证：1960年发展生猪头数超过来榜一倍！”那猪字写得浑厚饱满，又粗又大，简直就是一头圆滚滚胖呼呼的肥猪！不！简直就是一座蹲满大大小小猪子猪孙的饲养场！不！简直就是一幅万头钻动的肥猪满圈图！
