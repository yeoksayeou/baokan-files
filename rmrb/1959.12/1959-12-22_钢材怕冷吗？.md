Is Steel Afraid of the Cold?
Wang Xieshan

	On March 14, 1938, the city of Hasselt, Belgium, shivered in the bitter cold, the pointer on the thermometer stubbornly hovering around minus fifteen degrees Celsius... Suddenly, from the steel bridge spanning the Albert Canal in the city, came a burst of dense cracking sounds, as loud as if dozens of rifles and cannons were firing simultaneously, yet no smoke of any kind of guns or cannons could be seen. When people rushed to the bridge in a panic, they saw the massive steel bridge suddenly shake violently amidst the loud cracking sounds, breaking into three sections and plunging into the river before the horrified crowd. The bridge was less than two years old, and no one expected that it would suddenly collapse in such cold weather in a matter of minutes.

	Two years passed, and scientists and engineers still hadn't come to a correct conclusion about the above incident. But at this time, another steel bridge on the same canal suddenly collapsed in the same cold weather.

	These two bridge disasters immediately attracted the attention of many scientists. What force destroyed these two bridges? Scientists answered: "Severe cold." How "cruel" is the severe cold that even "ironclad" steel bridges are threatened with "life"!

	Why does cold threaten steel? At normal temperature, steel is a good ductile metal. When an external load exceeds the limit or is subjected to impact, it will produce a certain amount of irreversible deformation (plastic deformation) without cracks and damage; but at very low temperatures, this property of steel will change or even disappear, and the steel becomes very brittle at this time. Once the steel becomes brittle, it cannot withstand large deformations, and its resistance to impact is greatly reduced; once subjected to impact, cracks or even fractures will occur. The second reason why steel cannot resist the cold is that under the attack of cold, the stress in the weaker parts (stress concentration points) of the steel will continue to increase, so cracks are most likely to occur in these places. Understanding these two reasons, we can imagine the scene of the steel bridge being destroyed in the severe cold: the steel that makes up the bridge becomes a very brittle metal under the attack of severe cold, and once subjected to impact loads (which are common on bridges), cracks will occur in the weak parts, and when the cracks expand to a certain extent, the bridge can no longer support it and will collapse hopelessly...

	The destruction of steel due to cold is very dangerous. This kind of destruction often happens suddenly, so that people do not have time to notice or remedy it. The destruction of the Quebec Bridge in Canada on January 31, 1951, at minus 35°C was such a situation. Beforehand, people had conducted a thorough inspection for ten days, but they did not find any problems or signs.

	The fact that steel cannot withstand the cold has already attracted the attention of people, especially designers of buildings in extremely cold areas. Scientists pointed out that to improve the ability of steel structures in extremely cold areas to resist the cold, we must start with "prevention." First of all, high-quality steel should be selected. The carbon content of the steel should be appropriate, and the phosphorus content should be the lowest, because the phosphorus contained in the steel will greatly reduce its ability to resist impact when it is cold. Secondly, strengthening the weak links of the structure and minimizing stress concentration can also improve the structure's ability to resist cold.

	The properties of steel and metals at low temperatures have become one of the research topics of metallurgists, and scientists are studying varieties of steel that can resist the cold well to meet the needs of extremely cold regions.

　　钢材怕冷吗？
  　王燮山
    公元1938年3月14日那一天，比利时的哈塞尔特城在苦寒中瑟缩，寒暑表上的指针老停留在摄氏零下十五度的附近……。忽然从市内横跨阿尔伯特运河的钢构桥上传来了密集的噼啪声，声响大小好像有几十架步枪和大炮在同时发射，可是人们却望不见有任何枪炮之类发射的硝烟。等到人们从惊慌中跑到桥边的时候，只见那座庞大的钢桥在巨大的噼啪声中猛然地摇晃一下，折成了三段，在吓得发呆的人群面前，坠入了河中。这座桥建成还不到二年，人们意想不到会在这样严寒的天气里，在不到几分钟的时间内，突然间毁坏了。
    过了二年，科学家和工程师们对于上面的事件还没有作出正确的结论。可是在这时候，同一条运河上的另一座钢桥又在这样的冷天气中突然毁坏了。
    这两座桥的不幸事件，立刻引起了很多科学家的注意。是什么力量摧毁了这两座桥梁？科学家们回答说是：“严寒”。好“冷酷的”严寒，使“铁打的”钢桥也受到了“生命的”威胁！
    寒冷为什么会威胁钢材呢？钢在常温底下是一种很好的范性金属，当外加的荷载超过限度或者受到冲击时，它会产生一定的不能回复的变形（范性变形），而不致于产生裂痕而破坏；可是在温度很低时，钢的这种性质会发生变化甚至于消失，钢材在这时变得很脆。钢材一变脆，就忍受不了较大的变形，它对冲击的抵抗能力也就大大地降低；一旦受到冲击，就会产生裂缝甚至断裂。使钢材不能抵御寒冷的第二个原因是：钢材在寒冷的侵袭下，它的内部比较薄弱的地方（应力集中的地方）的应力会不断地增加，因而在这些地方最易产生裂缝。明白了这两个缘故，我们可以想像出钢桥在严寒下破坏的情景：组成桥梁的钢材在严寒的侵袭下变成了很脆的金属，一旦受到冲击荷载（这在桥梁上是经常有的），就会在薄弱的地方产生裂缝，裂缝扩大到一定的程度，桥梁再也支持不住，便会不可救药地垮台了……。
    钢材受到寒冷而毁坏的情况是很危险的，这种毁坏往往突如其来地发生，以致人们来不及觉察或者补救。1951年1月31日加拿大的奎北克桥在零下35℃的破坏也是这样的情况。事前，人们曾经以十天的时间进行过周密的检查，可是一点也没有发现什么毛病或征候。
    钢材受不住寒冷的情况，目前已经引起人们，特别是严寒地区建筑物设计者的重视。科学家们指出，要提高严寒地区钢结构物抵抗寒冷的能力，必须从“预防”着手。首先，应当选用品质好的钢材。钢材的含炭量要适当，含磷量要最低，因为钢材内所含的磷会大大地减低它在寒冷时抵抗冲击的能力。其次，加强结构物的薄弱环节，尽量减少应力集中，也能提高结构物抗寒能力。
    钢材和金属在低温下的性质问题，已经是金属学家研究的课题之一，科学家们正在研究能良好地抵抗寒冷的钢材的品种，以适应严寒地区的需要。
