　　The Road to Happiness
　　Han En, National Model Agricultural Laborer, Head of the Happiness Road People's Commune in Jiaohe, Jilin
    In 1959, we made achievements that we wouldn't have dared to imagine in the past. In 1960, we will make even greater achievements, because we have the People's Commune.
    Our Happiness Road People's Commune, under the leadership of the Party, has gone through a full thirteen years. Over the past thirteen years, it has grown from nothing, from small to large, from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, from agricultural cooperatives to People's Communes, successively experiencing five years of mutual aid teams, three years of elementary cooperatives, four years of advanced cooperatives, and one year of the People's Commune. In these thirteen years, our production has developed faster and faster, and our lives have become better and better. As the commune members say: "Small cooperatives bring small transformations, large cooperatives bring large transformations, and people's communes bring complete transformations." In 1959, our commune's agricultural production achieved a bumper harvest. The total grain output increased by 20% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with an average yield of 518 jin of grain per mu; we achieved the production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule; each commune member possessed an average of 1,928 jin of grain.
    1959 was a year of disasters, with fifty days of spring drought and thirty days of autumn flooding. Without the People's Commune, there would have been no harvest to speak of. But with the People's Commune, we were able to take a series of measures to overcome the droughts and floods. In the spring, in the shady slopes where the snow had not yet melted, the commune members harrowed and raked all of the more than 55,000 mu of land that had been deeply plowed the previous winter, preserving the spring moisture. Then, they diverted the peach blossom water from the mountains to the fields, irrigating more than 10,000 mu by gravity flow. When the sowing of dry land crops was over, it was the season for transplanting rice seedlings from April to June, but not a drop of rain fell across the commune. Seeing that some paddy fields could not be planted with seedlings, the entire commune divided its forces into different routes: one route dug channels to divert water from the Minzhu River into the paddy fields; another route further repaired eight reservoirs and twenty-seven river dams, and rushed to build three electric irrigation bases, giving full play to the role of storing water for irrigating fields; some people rushed to transplant rice seedlings, while others rushed to plant soybeans on 1,500 mu of paddy fields that were seriously short of water. At the same time, cooperation between the various management districts was strengthened, and water was rationally stored and released. These measures advanced simultaneously, enabling the entire commune to overcome the spring drought, and most of the paddy fields were transplanted with seedlings ahead of schedule, and they continued to overcome the autumn flooding in the autumn.
    In 1959, our forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations also achieved great development. A total of 6,750 mu of forest were planted in one year, completely eliminating barren mountains and bald ridges, and 10,000 cubic meters of timber were harvested to support national construction; the number of pigs, the head of the six domestic animals, increased by 1.25 times compared to before the communization; the total output value of sideline occupations increased by more than one time compared to 1958. Commune-run industries and other undertakings have also developed differently.
    The conditions in our commune are not good. The mountains are high, the water is cold, and the frost-free period is short. It is a well-known "cold air outlet" in the county. Before liberation, it was known as a "poor stick village"; now, its appearance has changed greatly. In the past, people often worried about not having enough to eat or wear, but now they no longer need to worry about it. The living standards of commune members are improving step by step. In 1959, the average income per person in the commune was 134 yuan, an increase of 24% compared to 1958, greatly exceeding the income level of the well-to-do middle peasants in the area in the past.
    The agricultural production of the Happiness Road Commune has already made great leaps forward for two consecutive years, but we are not satisfied with these achievements, and we will continue to leap forward in 1960. The total output of grain and soybeans will reach more than 17,700 tons, an increase of 23.7% compared to 1959, and the yield per mu will reach 550 jin. At the same time, we will actively develop diversified operations, promote the simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and achieve the goal of "2,000 jin of grain, one cubic meter of timber, one pig, ten chickens, and 100 yuan of sideline income per person"; strive to deliver 10 million jin of grain and soybeans, 15,000 cubic meters of timber, 1,500 fat pigs, 20,000 poultry, and a large number of other agricultural and sideline native products to the state, supporting socialist construction. Under the correct leadership of the Party, I and all the commune members are determined and confident to build the Happiness Road Commune even better, and let it emit an even more brilliant light!

　　幸福之路
　　全国农业劳动模范吉林蛟河幸福之路人民公社社长  韩恩
    1959年，我们做出了过去想也不敢想的成就。1960年，我们还要做出更大的成就，因为我们有了人民公社。
    我们幸福之路人民公社，在党的领导下，经历了整整十三个年头。十三年来，它从无到有，从小到大，从初级社到高级社，从农业社到人民公社，先后经过了五年互助组，三年初级社，四年高级社，和一年人民公社。这十三年，我们生产的发展，越来越快了，我们的生活越来越好了。正如社员们说的：“小社小翻身，大社大翻身，公社彻底翻身”。1959年，我们公社的农业生产获得大丰收，粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年增长20％，平均每亩地产粮食五百一十八斤；提前八年实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的产量指标；每个社员平均占有粮食一千九百二十八斤。
    1959年是个灾年，春旱五十天，秋涝三十天。如果没有人民公社，那就甭想有收成了。可是有了人民公社，我们就能采取一连串的办法，战胜了旱涝灾害。春起，阴坡地积雪未化，社员们就把前冬深翻的五万五千多亩地，全部耙耢一遍，保住了春墒。接着，又把山上的桃花水引到地里，自流灌溉了一万多亩。旱田播种结束，正是4到6月的插秧季节，全社滴雨未下，眼看有些水田插不上秧，全社就分路出兵，一路挖渠道，把民主河的水引入水田；一路进一步整修了八个水库、二十七个拦河坝，并突击建起三处电力灌溉基地，充分发挥了蓄水灌田的作用；一部分人突击插秧，还有一部分人把一千五百亩缺水严重的水田抢种上大豆。与此同时，加强了各管理区的协作，合理蓄水放水。这些措施齐头并进，使全社战胜了春旱，绝大部分水田都提前插上秧，并在秋季继续战胜了秋涝。
    1959年，我们的林业、牧业、副业也都有很大的发展，一年共造林六千七百五十亩，彻底消灭了荒山秃岭，并采伐木材一万立方米，支援国家建设；六畜之首的猪，比公社化前增长一点二五倍；副业总产值比1958年增长一倍多。社办工业和其他事业，也有不同的发展。
    我们社的条件并不好，山高水冷无霜期短，是全县有名的“冷风口”。解放前，被称为“穷棒子屯”；现在，面貌已经大变。过去人们经常操心没有吃没有穿的，现在已用不着操心了。社员的生活水平步步提高。1959年全社平均每人收入一百三十四元，比1958年提高24％，大大超过了当地过去富裕中农的收入水平。
    幸福之路公社的农业生产已经连续两年大跃进，但是我们并不满足这些成绩，1960年还要继续跃进。粮食，大豆总产量要达到一万七千七百多吨，比1959年提高23.7％，亩产量达到五百五十斤。同时积极发展多种经营，促进农林牧副渔五业齐兴，实现“每人二千斤粮食，一立方米木材，一头猪，十只鸡，副业收入一百元”的奋斗目标；争取交售给国家一千万斤粮食和大豆，一万五千立方米木材，一千五百头肥猪，二万只家禽，以及大量的其他农副土特产品，支援社会主义建设。在党的正确领导下，我和全体社员都有决心有信心，把幸福之路公社建设得更美好，让它发出更加灿烂的光辉！
