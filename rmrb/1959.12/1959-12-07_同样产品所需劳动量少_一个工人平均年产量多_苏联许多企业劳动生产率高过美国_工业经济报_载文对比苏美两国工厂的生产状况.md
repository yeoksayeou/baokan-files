Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 6th - M. G. MaksaRev, Chairman of the State Scientific and Technical Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, recently published an article in the Soviet "Industrial Economics Newspaper" stating that labor productivity in many sectors of the Soviet national economy has now surpassed that of the most developed capitalist countries.

The article stated that the total labor required to manufacture the TE-3 type diesel locomotive with a power of 2,000 horsepower at the Kolomna Factory in the Soviet Union is 20% less than that required to manufacture the same type of diesel locomotive in the United States. The total man-hours required to manufacture the DT-54 tractor at the Kharkov Tractor Plant are 15% less than those required to manufacture the same type of tractor in the United States. The labor required to manufacture the IK-62 type screw turning lathe at the Moscow "Red Proletarian" Machine Tool Plant is 20% less than the labor required to manufacture similar machine tools in the United States. The labor required to manufacture the GAZ-51A truck in the Soviet Union is also not more than that in the United States.

In other sectors of the national economy, many Soviet enterprises and work sections have higher labor productivity than American enterprises. For example, in the blast furnace workshop of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Soviet Union, an average worker can produce 7,019 tons of pig iron per year. The total labor required by this enterprise to smelt one ton of open-hearth steel is 20% lower than that in the United States. The iron smelting volume per worker in the blast furnace workshop of the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Combine is 6,837 tons, and that of the Zaporozhye Steel Plant is 4,388 tons, while the best steel plant in Gary, Indiana, in the United States does not reach 4,300 tons.

MaksaRev said that in order to establish the material and technical base of communism, we must concentrate our efforts on accelerating technological progress at the fastest speed, focusing on the manufacturing of new high-productivity machines, equipment, instruments, raw materials, advanced technological procedures, comprehensive mechanization, and equipment for production automation, and applying them to production in various economic sectors.

The results of recent years have shown that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in this regard. In 1958 and the first nine months of this year alone, the Soviet Union manufactured more than 3,500 new high-productivity machines and equipment, of which more than 600 have been put into mass production. The technical level of many types of new technological equipment manufactured in the Soviet Union is not only not inferior to, but also greatly exceeds the highest level achieved abroad.

The article pointed out that in 1960, the technical level, automation level, and mechanization level of various sectors of the Soviet national economy will be further improved. Next year, the Soviet Union will begin mass production of approximately 400 new industrial products, while ceasing the production of 540 technologically obsolete machines, and designing and manufacturing more than 1,400 new machines, equipment, instruments, and materials. In order to improve the level of production automation, the production of various automated equipment will be especially accelerated. For example, next year, the total output of metal-cutting machine tools in the Soviet Union will increase by 6.4%, of which, automatic and semi-automatic lathes will increase by 19.7%, automatic and semi-automatic boring machines will increase by 29.7%, automatic and semi-automatic milling machines will increase by 14.6%, and automatic and semi-automatic production lines for the machine manufacturing industry will increase by 26.2%.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 6th - Boris Paton, Academician of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and winner of the Lenin Prize, said that the level of mechanization of welding production in the Soviet Union has now surpassed that of the most developed capitalist countries, including the United States.

In a recent article published in the "Industrial Economics Newspaper," Academician Paton pointed out that by 1965, the production of welded structures in the Soviet Union will at least double. By that time, the workload of automatic welding and contact welding using flux will increase by about one and a half times, the workload of electroslag welding will increase by one time, and the workload of gas-electric welding will increase by five times. Due to the improvement of the mechanization level of welding work, it will be possible to save approximately 20 billion rubles during the Seven-Year Plan period.

Paton said that in the past year alone, Soviet factories have manufactured approximately 200 types of automatic and semi-automatic welding machines. He said that some economic zones in the Soviet Union have already begun to modify the designs of machines and machinery in order to replace riveted complex castings and forgings with welded parts to the greatest extent possible.

He said that the transition from partial mechanization of welding operations to comprehensive mechanization of technical processes has now begun on a large scale. The automated welding methods of non-ferrous metals and alloys are being successfully promoted. Wide-layer welding with strip electrodes is a highly productive method, and this new method has been widely adopted in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 6th - According to TASS, the production of various remote-controlled machines in the Soviet Union will increase fourfold in the next six years compared to this year. During the Seven-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union will attach great importance to the research and production of remote-controlled machinery in improving the technical level of the national economy. Now, almost all economic zones in the Soviet Union are producing various remote-control equipment. In addition, six large factories will soon be specialized in the production of remote-control equipment.

    同样产品所需劳动量少  一个工人平均年产量多
    苏联许多企业劳动生产率高过美国
    “工业经济报”载文对比苏美两国工厂的生产状况
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联部长会议国家科学技术委员会主席马克萨烈夫最近在苏联“工业经济报”发表文章说，苏联许多国民经济部门中的劳动生产率目前已经超过了最发达的资本主义国家。
    文章说，苏联科洛姆纳工厂制造功率为两千马力的特埃—3型内燃机车所需要的总劳动量，比美国制造同类型的内燃机车所需要的劳动量少20％。哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂制造德特—54型拖拉机所需要的总人时比美国制造同类型的拖拉机少15％。莫斯科“红色无产者”工作母机制造厂制造伊克—62型螺丝旋削机床所需要的劳动量比美国制造同类机床的劳动量少20％。苏联制造加斯—51A型载重汽车所需要的劳动量也不比美国多。
    在其他国民经济部门中，苏联也有许多企业和工段的劳动生产率高于美国企业的劳动生产率。例如，在苏联马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂的高炉车间，一个工人每年平均可以生产七千零一十九吨生铁，这个企业每炼一吨平炉钢所需要的总劳动量要比美国低20％。库兹涅茨克钢铁联合工厂高炉车间的每个工人的熔铁量为六千八百三十七吨，萨坡罗什炼钢厂为四千三百八十八吨，而美国赫里城中最好的钢铁工厂的这个指标还达不到四千三百吨。
    马克萨烈夫说，为了建立共产主义物质技术基础，我们必须把力量集中在以最大的速度加速技术进步方面，集中在制造新的高生产率的机器、装备、仪器、原料、先进的技术程序、全面机械化和生产自动化的设备并把它们运用到各经济部门的生产中去。
    近年来的结果表明，苏联在这方面已经取得了极大的成就。单在1958年和今年头九个月内，苏联就制造了三千五百多种新的高生产率的机器和装备，其中有六百多种已成批生产。苏联制造的许多种新技术设备，其技术水平不仅不亚于而且大大超过了外国达到的最高的水平。
    文章指出，1960年苏联各国民经济部门的技术水平、自动化和机械化水平将进一步提高。明年，苏联将开始成批生产约四百种新的工业产品，同时将停止五百四十种技术上已经过时的机器的生产，并设计和制造一千四百多种新机器、设备、仪器和材料。为了提高生产的自动化水平，将特别加速各种自动化设备的生产。例如，明年苏联的金属切削机床的总产量将增加6.4％，其中，自动化和半自动化旋床将增加19.7％，自动化和半自动化搪床将增加29.7％，自动化和半自动化铣床增加14.6％，为机器制造业生产的自动化作业线和半自动化作业线将增加26.2％。
    新华社莫斯科6日电　乌克兰科学院院士、列宁奖金获得者鲍里斯·帕顿说，现在，苏联焊接生产的机械化水平已经超过了包括美国在内的最发达的资本主义国家。
    帕顿院士最近在“工业经济报”发表文章指出，到1965年，苏联焊接结构的生产至少将增加一倍。到那时候，利用助熔剂的自动焊接和接触焊接的工作量要大约增加一倍半，用矿渣电焊法焊接的工作量将增加一倍，气电焊接工作量将增加五倍。由于提高电焊工作的机械化水平，将使得有可能在七年计划期间节约大约二百亿卢布。
    帕顿说，仅在最近一年，苏联工厂就制造了约二百种自动焊接机和半自动焊接机。他说，现在苏联一些经济区已开始修改机器和机械的设计，以便在最大程度上用焊接的零件来代替铆合的复杂铸件和锻件。
    他说，现在已经大规模开始从部分焊接操作的机械化向技术过程全面机械化过渡。有色金属与合金的自动化焊接方法正在顺利地推广。用带状电极进行宽层焊接是一种生产率很高的方法，这种新方法在生产中已经得到广泛的采用。
    据新华社莫斯科6日电　据塔斯社报道，今后六年中，苏联的各种遥控机械的生产量将比今年增加四倍。七年计划期间，苏联在提高国民经济的技术水平方面，将非常重视遥控机械的研究和生产。现在，差不多苏联的所有经济区都在生产各种遥控设备。此外，有六家大型工厂不久将实行专业化，专门生产遥控设备。
