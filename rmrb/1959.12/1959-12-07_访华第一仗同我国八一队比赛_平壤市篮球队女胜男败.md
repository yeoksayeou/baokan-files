Xinhua News Agency, 6th -- The People's Democratic Republic of Korea's Pyongyang men's and women's basketball teams played their first friendly matches in China tonight against the "August 1st" men's and women's basketball teams in Beijing. The women's team won, and the men's team lost. The score for the women's team was 54 to 53; for the men's team, it was 61 to 92.

Six thousand spectators watched the two exciting games at the Beijing Gymnasium, applauding the visiting team's tenacious style and the home team's rapid offense.

The women's game was extremely tense. The physically strong visiting team used a full-court, man-to-man defense throughout the entire thirty-six minutes. At the beginning, the "August 1st" team was a little flustered, with many passing errors and few shooting opportunities, and the score consistently lagged behind. At the end of the first half, the visiting team led by thirteen points, 34 to 21. The visiting team's captain, Wu Zhenshu (number 3), and players Jin Jiyu (number 5), Zhao Renhua (number 8), and Li Zhenzi (number 15) had all participated in this year's World Women's Basketball Championship. They frequently scored with accurate mid- and long-range shots or driving layups.

In the second half, the "August 1st" team also adopted a pressing man-to-man tactic, strengthening their defense. At the same time, in offense, they used more driving layups or scored through the 1.79-meter center, Shi Wenyuan (number 4), closely chasing the score. With only fourteen seconds left in the game, they narrowed the gap to 52 to 54, only two points behind. At this time, visiting team Zhao Renhua committed a foul, and "August 1st" team's Zhang Rubing got two free throw opportunities. She made the first free throw, making the score 53 to 54, only one point behind. The second attempt was to miss the free throw intentionally so that Shi Wenyuan, who was under the basket, could grab the rebound and score, but it was not successful, and they lost by one point.

The men's game was played at a very fast pace. The "August 1st" team had an advantage in height, and after grabbing the rebound, they launched a fast break. Cai Jijie, Yu Yuanxu, and the two-meter-tall Fu Ruide frequently scored under the basket. In the first half, the "August 1st" team led 46 to 31.

In the second half, although the visiting team repeatedly used driving layups or mid-range shots to mount a tenacious counterattack, the "August 1st" team defended more tightly and attacked even faster, winning by thirty-one points at the end of the game.

The Pyongyang men's and women's basketball teams will also hold friendly matches with the Beijing men's and women's basketball teams in Beijing on the 8th.

    访华第一仗同我国八一队比赛
    平壤市篮球队女胜男败
    新华社6日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国平壤市男、女篮球队，今晚在北京同“八一”男、女篮球队举行访华第一次友谊比赛，结果女胜男败。女子队的比数是五十四比五十三；男子队是六十一比九十二。
    六千名观众在北京体育馆比赛馆观看了这两场精采的球赛，他们不时为客队顽强的作风和主队快速的攻势报以热烈的掌声。
    女子队的比赛极为紧张。体力良好的客队全场三十六分钟一直采用全场紧逼人盯人的防守战术，开始时“八一”队有些慌乱，传球失误多，投篮机会少，得分始终落后，上半场结束时客队以三十四比二十一领先了十三分。客队队长吴贞淑（三号）和队员金基玉（五号）、赵仁花（八号）、李贞子（十五号）都是参加过今年世界女子篮球锦标赛的选手，她们频频用准确的中、远距离投篮或切入上篮得分。
    下半场“八一”队也采用紧逼盯人战术，加强了防守，同时在进攻时多采用切入上篮或通过身高一米七九的中锋石文苑（四号）得分的办法，紧紧追赶。到全场比赛还剩十四秒钟时，追成五十二比五十四只差两分。这时客队赵仁花犯规，
  “八一”队张如冰获两次罚球机会，她第一次罚中，成五十三比五十四只差一分。第二次采用不罚中由在篮下的石文苑抢到篮板球投篮得分的办法，但是没有成功，结果仍以一分之差失败。
    男子队的比赛是在很快的速度下进行的。“八一”队队员在身材高度方面占了优势，抢到篮板球后就发动快攻，蔡集杰、俞元煦和身高两米的符瑞德屡屡在篮下投篮得分。上半场“八一”队以四十六比三十一领先。
    下半场客队虽然多次采用切入上篮或中距离投篮的办法顽强反攻，但“八一”队防守较严，进攻速度更快，终场时赢了三十一分。
    平壤市男、女篮球队8日还将在北京同北京男、女篮球队举行友谊赛。
