Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th: Qingdao No. 4 Middle School has implemented the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor," rectified and consolidated its labor bases, and insisted on productive labor, further improving the quality of teaching.

This year, all twenty-one classes, comprising nine hundred and nine students in senior and junior high school, have participated in labor in the school's five factories. Labor classes, like other courses, are included in the curriculum and conducted in an orderly manner according to the teaching plan.

The school stipulates that junior high school students participate in six hours of labor per week, and senior high school students participate in eight hours of labor per week. In order to better integrate factory labor with teaching, the school has rectified its labor bases, abolished the knitting factory, and added a textile factory and a cement factory, based on teaching needs and supply, production, and sales conditions. The original woodworking factory, machine factory, and chemical factory have added necessary workshops. At the same time, a systematic labor education syllabus has also been compiled based on the production nature of each factory.

The close integration of teaching and productive labor has greatly improved the quality of education. This year, the school has not only compiled a labor education syllabus, lecturing on relevant scientific knowledge in conjunction with workshop labor, but also compiled a teaching syllabus combining productive labor according to the needs of various subjects. In this way, book knowledge and labor practice are combined, and students not only master production technology but also consolidate theoretical knowledge. Through productive labor practice, students' socialist consciousness and labor concepts have also been significantly strengthened.

    青岛四中贯彻教育方针提高教学质量
    据新华社济南16日电　青岛第四中学贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，整顿和巩固了劳动基地，坚持生产劳动，进一步提高了教学质量。
    今年以来，全校高、初中二十一个班，九百零九名学生，都分别参加了校内五个工厂的劳动。劳动课和其他各门课程一样列入了课程表内，按教学计划有秩序地进行。
    这个学校规定初中学生每周参加六小时劳动，高中学生每周参加八小时劳动。为了使工厂劳动更好地与教学结合，学校根据教学需要和供、产、销条件，整顿了劳动基地，取消了针织厂，增加了纺织厂和水泥厂；原有的木工厂、机械厂和化工厂增设了必要的车间。同时，还根据各工厂的生产性质，编写了系统的劳动教育大纲。
    教学与生产劳动紧密结合，大大提高了教育质量。今年，这个学校不仅编写了劳动教育大纲，结合车间劳动，讲授有关科学知识；还根据各科教学的需要，编写了结合生产劳动的教学大纲。这样，就使书本知识和劳动实践结合起来，学生不但掌握了生产技术，而且巩固了理论知识。通过生产劳动实践，学生们的社会主义觉悟和劳动观念也显著加强。
