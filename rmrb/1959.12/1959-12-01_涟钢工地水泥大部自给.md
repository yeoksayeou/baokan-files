The workers of the Second Engineering Division of the Hunan Provincial Metallurgical Bureau Construction Company, undertaking the capital construction tasks of the Lianyuan Iron and Steel Plant ("Lian Steel"), used slag from "Lian Steel's" steelmaking and ironmaking processes mixed with lime and gypsum to trial-produce Grade 300 lime-slag cement. From the completion of a cement plant in mid-October to November 20, more than 140 tons of lime-slag cement had been produced. Now, the concrete foundations, floors, and mortar of the construction project are all using self-produced lime-slag cement. After testing, the strength and stability were all qualified.

The workers participating in the construction of the cement plant, encouraged by the slogan "Vigorously develop cement production to support Lian Steel's construction" put forward by the Party General Branch, displayed soaring enthusiasm and built a 1,400-square-meter factory building with a ball mill room, powder storage, and drying room in just ten days, setting up a cement plant.

    涟钢工地水泥大部自给
    本报讯　担任涟源钢铁厂基本建设任务的湖南省冶金局建筑公司第二工程处职工，利用“涟钢”炼钢炼铁后的矿渣拌和石灰、石膏，试制成了三百标号的石灰矿渣水泥。从10月中旬建成一个水泥厂，到11月20日止，已生产一百四十多吨石灰矿渣水泥。现在建设工程的混凝土基础、地面、砂浆，都是使用自己生产的石灰矿渣水泥。经过试验，强度和安定性全部合格。
    参加建筑水泥厂的职工，在党总支提出的“大搞水泥生产，支援涟钢建设”的口号鼓舞下，发挥了冲天干劲，仅十天时间就建起了有球磨机房、粉料库、烘干房等工程的一千四百平方米的厂房，办起了水泥厂。
