    Organizational Work Needs to be Done Well
    At present, in various industries and enterprises, the achievements of technological innovation are bearing abundant fruit. At this time, what should the diligent gardeners do? Let's take a look at the capital construction department of Harbin. They are good gardeners who love these fruits and are good at using them. They systematically summarized the creations of the masses in the technological innovation movement and promoted them in complete sets, so that mechanical construction replaced many heavy manual labor, and the labor productivity of the city's construction workers increased almost twice as much as in the first quarter of this year. What a great harvest the technological innovation movement has gained here!
    Under the socialist system, any advanced experience and innovative creation is the wealth of the whole society and can be applied by the whole society. However, the transition from possibility to reality is not a spontaneous process; it requires leadership and organizational work. When advanced technology is first born, it is always imperfect and needs to be improved. This requires leadership and organizational work, especially now, when the technological innovation movement is surging and tens of thousands of innovative creations are emerging, a very important organizational work—systematic summarization and complete set promotion—is even more necessary. Doing this work in a timely manner can avoid this situation: a creation has long been successful elsewhere, but this place is still exploring and experimenting; a reform method has already failed elsewhere, but this place is still taking the same detours; doing this work in a timely manner can enable the same type of advanced experience to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and become perfect from imperfect; it can concentrate the scattered innovation results, organize them into complete sets, and comprehensively improve the production level. In short, systematically summarizing and promoting technological innovation achievements in complete sets is a very important link in the technological innovation movement. Grasping this link will deepen the technological innovation movement, greatly increase production efficiency, and be conducive to balanced production and comprehensive completion of the plan. Therefore, this work should be done by enterprises, by a region, by an industry, and by the whole country.
    How to do it? It cannot be done well by relying only on a few leading cadres and technicians. Because they cannot study so many innovative creations, nor can they have such extensive professional knowledge and practical experience. Therefore, it is necessary to organize the masses to summarize and organize the masses to select and match complete sets. There are many benefits to doing so. First, advanced technology is created by the masses, they are the most familiar with it, they are experts, and it is quick and practical for them to identify the good and bad and match them into complete sets. Second, the process of summarizing and matching is also the process of understanding and learning advanced technology. Taking this approach, advanced experience is most likely to gain a foothold and take root among the masses. Third, through mass appraisals and performance competitions, the enthusiasm of the masses for further innovation and creation is encouraged. If some links do not yet have more advanced technology and cannot be matched into complete sets for the time being, then when the masses see the weak links clearly, they will quickly rise up to eliminate the "blank spots." This work is a regular work. Because the innovative creations of the masses are constantly emerging, they need to be constantly summarized and promoted. New technologies are promoted and newer technologies appear; this time it is systematically summarized, and soon it will be further supplemented in the practice of the masses; this time it is matched into a complete set, and soon some links will move forward and break the balance. At this time, it is necessary to summarize and promote again. In this way, the advanced technology in production and construction will become richer and richer, and its role in production will become greater and greater.
    The experience of the capital construction department of Harbin is very important. We hope that all regions, all industries, and all enterprises and institutions can also systematically summarize and promote the innovative achievements of their units, systems, and regions in complete sets at appropriate times. This will not only have an immediate effect on completing this year's plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, but also create important conditions for continued leap forward next year.

    需要做好组织工作
    现在，在各个行业和企业里，技术革新的成果几乎都是累累满枝。在这个时候，辛勤的园丁应当怎么办呢？让我们看看哈尔滨的基本建设部门吧。他们是热爱这些果实、善于利用这些果实的好园丁。他们把群众在技术革新运动中的创造，系统地总结起来，成套地推广开去，使得机械施工代替了许多笨重的体力劳动，使得全市建筑工人的劳动生产率比今年第一季度几乎提高了一倍。技术革新运动在他们这里获得了多么大的丰收啊！
    在社会主义制度下，任何一项先进经验和革新创造都是全社会的财富，都可能为全社会所应用。但是，从可能到现实，则不是自发的过程；这里需要领导，需要做组织工作。当先进技术刚刚诞生的时候，总是不完善的，有待于改进和提高。这里需要领导，也需要做组织工作，尤其是现在，当技术革新风起云涌，革新创造数以万计地出现的时候，一项十分重要的组织工作——系统总结，成套推广，就更为必要了。及时地做好这一工作，就可以避免这种情况：一项创造在别的地方早就成功了，这个地方还在摸索试验；一种改革方法在别的地方已经失败了，这个地方还在走同样的弯路；及时地做好这一工作，就可以使同一类型的先进经验取长补短，互相补充，从不完善变得完善；就可以把分散的革新成果集中起来，组织成套，全面地提高生产水平。总之，系统地总结和成套地推广技术革新的成果，是技术革新运动中的一个十分重要的环节。抓住了这个环节，就会使技术革新运动深入一步，使生产效率大幅度的提高，而且有利于均衡生产，有利于全面地完成计划。因此，这项工作，企业要做，一个地区要做，一个行业要做，全国都要做。
  怎样做呢？只靠少数领导干部和技术人员来做，做不了，也做不好。因为他们研究不了那么多的革新创造，也不可能有这样广泛的业务知识和实践经验。因此，必须组织群众来总结，组织群众来选配成套。这样做有很多好处。第一、先进技术是群众创造的，他们最熟悉，是内行，由他们来鉴别好坏，配搭成套，做得又快，又切合实际。第二、总结、配套的过程，也就是认识和学习先进技术的过程。采取这种作法，先进经验最容易在群众中站稳脚，立下根。第三、通过群众性的评比和表演竞赛，又鼓励了群众再革新再创造的积极性。如果有一些环节暂时没有出现更先进的技术，还配不成套，那么，当群众看清了薄弱环节之后，就会很快地起来消灭“空白点”。这个工作是经常性的工作。因为群众中的革新创造是不断出现的，需要不断地总结、推广。新的技术推广了又出现更新的技术；这一次系统地总结了，过不久，它又会在群众的实践中得到新的补充；这一次配成了套，不久，其中有些环节又会向前发展，突破了平衡。这时，就需要再总结，再推广。如此循环不已，生产建设中的先进技术就会越来越丰富，它在生产中所起的作用也将会越来越大。
      哈尔滨市基本建设部门的经验很重要，我们希望各个地区，各个  行业、各个企业单位，也都能在适当的时机，把本单位、本系统、本地区的革新成果进行系统地总结、成套地推广。这不仅对提前超额完成今年的计划会发生立竿见影的功效，而且将为明年的继续跃进创造重要的条件。
