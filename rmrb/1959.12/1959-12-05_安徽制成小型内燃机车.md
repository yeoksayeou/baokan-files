    Anhui has recently trial-produced a standard-gauge narrow-gauge railway diesel locomotive.

    This diesel locomotive is suitable for standard-gauge narrow-gauge railway transportation and is a small internal combustion locomotive. It has more advantages than locomotives modified from trucks. The traction capacity of a diesel locomotive is more than three times higher than that of a truck. The cost of diesel is also lower than the cost of gasoline. This diesel locomotive uses a high-speed, multi-cylinder, lightweight 300-horsepower diesel engine; the locomotive transmission uses connecting rod transmission, and the designed traction capacity is 500 tons.

    This locomotive will be used on the large narrow-gauge railway that has already been completed from the Fengyangshan Reservoir to the Linqiao section. This narrow-gauge railway is 31 kilometers long and is laid with standard-gauge heavy rails. It will soon be connected to the Mentai Zi Station on the Jinpu Railway.

    安徽制成小型内燃机车
    本报讯　安徽省蚌埠最近试制成一台标准轨距的土铁路柴油机车。
    这种柴油机车，适用于标准轨距的土铁路运输，是一种小型内燃机车。它比用载重汽车改制的机车有更多的优点。柴油机车牵引能力比汽车高三倍以上。柴油的成本也比汽油的成本低。这种柴油机车采用了高速度、多汽缸、轻型的三百马力柴油机；机车传动使用连杆传动，设计牵引能力为五百吨。
    这台机车将在已经修通的凤阳山水库到林桥段大型土铁路上运用。这条土铁路全长三十一公里，铺设了标准轨距重型铁轨，不久将和津浦铁路门台子站接通。
