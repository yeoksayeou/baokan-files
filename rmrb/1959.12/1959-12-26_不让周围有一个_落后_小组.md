Not Letting Any Surrounding Group Be "Backward"
    Zhao Mengtao, National Advanced Producer, Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, Fine Yarn Workshop

　　The New Year is approaching again. I remember that in the New Year of 1959, our group of five advanced producers agreed: on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we would ensure that we and all the female workers in the group would better learn from each other and continue to leap forward in 1959. After a year of hard work, our determination has been realized. This year, another twelve female workers in our group have become advanced producers of the factory and the workshop. The second and third groups in our class have also leaped to become advanced production groups in the factory. Moreover, the mutual help and common improvement between groups has become the general atmosphere of the entire factory. This new scene of leap forward is so gratifying.

　　The Party often teaches us that helping the masses advance together is the responsibility and obligation of a Communist Party member. This year, when speeding up the machines, some of the female workers in our group often failed to complete the state plan. After discussion and research, we found that the reason for not completing the plan was slow yarn joining and the cleaning work not being done well. We then passed on the advanced experience in cleaning and yarn joining that we had learned from the Xinqin Textile Factory and the Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 to other female workers. After Zheng Qiuyue and Zhai Fulan improved their cleaning work and yarn joining speed, they passed on their experience to new workers Chen Zezhen and Niu Lingling. Chen Zezhen and Niu Lingling also caught up with the advanced level and were selected as advanced producers. In this way, one person passed on to another, and advanced thinking and advanced technology were quickly promoted in the group. This ensured the completion of the state plan. In this year, seventeen of the twenty members of the group were successively rated as advanced producers, and the group repeatedly won the honorary title of advanced collective of the factory.

　　The Party constantly teaches us: "One flower does not make a spring; a riot of color is spring." We actively helped other groups improve production. In May of this year, the third group failed to complete the state plan, and the members all complained that the machines were not good. According to the instructions of the Party branch, we went to work on the machines in the third group that were considered "the worst." As soon as we got on the machines, we concentrated on watching the rotation of the machines and seized the time to do a good job of cleaning and repairing the machines. As a result, on the first day, we produced half as much white waste as the original shift worker and overfulfilled the daily production task. At this point, the members of the third group realized that whether the plan could be completed depended on people, not machines. One by one, they were full of energy and completed the state plan in succession during the six months from June to November. After the third group leaped to become an advanced production group, it immediately helped other groups overcome difficulties and leap forward together. At present, a spirit of mutual love and assistance has been promoted between groups.

　　This year, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of comrades, we have done a little work, but compared with Wu Lianghu, a worker at the Wuhan Jiang'an Vehicle Factory who selflessly helped others, it is still very insufficient. In the new year, I will always listen to the Party, muster greater enthusiasm, humbly learn from the advanced thinking and advanced technology of others, strive to increase yarn joining from the current twenty ends per minute to twenty-five ends, and maintain the daily and comprehensive overfulfillment of the state plan. At the same time, I will connect with Liu Xiaobian of the weaving workshop, Wang Fenglan of the roving workshop, and forty other advanced production groups in other workshops, and through technical performances, technical meetings, and the signing of mutual teaching and learning contracts, etc., I will do everything possible to bring along the other one hundred and thirty-five groups in the factory, and not allow any group around me to wear the "backward" label.

　　Recently, we have established the "Gaganova Collaboration Team," which implements large-scale collaboration both on and off duty, and strengthens large-scale collaboration between neighboring groups, so as to achieve simultaneous blooming in all directions, a full house of red in the entire workshop, and to welcome the new year of continued leap forward with a red ending this year and a red opening next year.

### 不让周围有一个“落后”小组

　　不让周围有一个“落后”小组
    全国先进生产者西北国棉一厂细纱工  赵梦桃
    新年又快到了。记得，在1959年新年的时候，我们小组五名先进生产者相约：在1958年大跃进的基础上，保证同全组女工一起更好地互相学习，在1959年继续跃进。经过这一年的努力，我们的决心实现了。今年，我们小组又有十二名女工成为厂的、车间的先进生产者，同班的第二、第三小组也一跃而为厂里的先进生产小组，而且组与组之间互相帮助，共同提高，已成为全厂的风气。这种跃进的新景象，太叫人高兴了。
    党经常教导我们：帮助群众同自己一道前进，是共产党员的责任和义务。今年加快车速时，我们组里的几位女工，往往不能完成国家计划。经过讨论研究，发现完不成计划的原因是接头慢、清洁工作没有做好。我们便把自己从新秦纺织厂、西北国棉二厂学到的清洁、接头方面的先进经验，传授给其他女工。郑秋月、翟福兰的清洁工作的成绩和接头速度提高以后，又把她们的经验传授给新工人陈泽珍、牛玲玲。陈泽珍、牛玲玲也赶上了先进水平，被选为先进生产者。这样，一个传一个，先进的思想和先进的技术很快就在组里得到发扬光大。这就保证了国家计划的完成。在这一年中，全组二十名组员就有十七名先后被评为先进生产者，小组也一再获得了厂的先进集体的光荣称号。
    党不断教导我们：“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春。”我们便积极帮助别的组提高生产。今年5月，第三组完不成国家计划，组员都喊车子不好看。根据党支部的指示，我们到三组一部被认为“最难看”的车子上工作。一上车子，我们便聚精会神地注视着机器的转动，抓紧时间做好清洁工作，检修车子。结果，第一天就比原来的值车工少出一半白花，超额完成了当日的生产任务。这一下，三组的组员都认识到：计划能不能完成，决定的是人，而不是机器。一个个鼓起了干劲，在6月到11月的六个月中，都接连完成了国家计划。第三组跃为先进生产小组以后，又立刻帮助其他小组克服困难，共同跃进。目前，组与组之间都发扬了你帮我、我助你的友爱精神。
    今年，我们在党的领导下和同志们的帮助下，作了一点点工作，同舍己帮人的武汉江岸车辆厂工人吴良湖等比较起来，就显得很不够了。在新的一年里，我要永远听党的话，鼓足更大的干劲，虚心学习别人的先进思想和先进技术，争取每分钟接头从现在的二十根提高到二十五根，保持日日全面地超额完成国家计划。同时，要串连织布车间的刘小变、粗纱车间的王凤兰以及其他车间的四十个先进生产小组，通过技术表演、技术会议、订立互教互学合同等办法，千方百计地把全厂其他一百三十五个小组都带动起来，不让自己的周围有一个小组戴着“落后”的帽子。
    最近，我们已经成立了“加干诺娃协作队”，一面实行上下班大协作，一面加强相邻小组的大协作，做到上、下、左、右一齐开花，整个车间满堂红，用今年红到底、明年开门红来迎接新的继续跃进的一年。（附图片）
