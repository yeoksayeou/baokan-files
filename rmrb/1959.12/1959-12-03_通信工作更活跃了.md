    Our bureau's representative to the National Congress of Heroes, Comrade Chen Yimin, brought back the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the spirit of the Congress, which strengthened our resolve to move forward.
    In order to further ensure that communications services are available wherever needed, she and her colleagues jointly studied and adjusted the labor organization, drawing on business staff to go deep into boiler factories and construction sites to serve the workers.
    Inspired by the spirit of the Congress, line workers quickly installed urgently needed telephones for newly built factories and mines, and laid more than 400 meters of cable.
    Transfer, sorting, and delivery staff, in order to ensure that readers receive central and provincial newspapers in a timely manner, have adopted the method of sending people ahead to meet the train at previous stations. During the return trip on the train, they sort the newspapers 30 minutes in advance, so that the newspapers can be delivered as quickly as possible…
    After the long-distance telephone operators learned advanced operating methods, the circuit utilization rate increased from 59% last month to about 64% on November 17, promptly and accurately clearing long-distance calls. Many other advanced experiences from the Congress of Heroes are also taking root and bearing fruit here.

    通信工作更活跃了
    我局出席全国群英会的代表陈一民同志，给我们带回了党中央的指示和大会的精神，给我们增加了前进的力量。
    为了进一步做到哪里需要通信，就服务到哪里，她和全班同志共同研究，调整了劳动组织，抽出营业员深入到锅炉厂和建筑工地去，为工人服务。
    在大会精神的鼓舞下，线路工人迅速为新建厂矿安装了急需的电话，架设了四百多米的电缆。
    转运、分拣、投递的职工，为了让读者及时看到中央及省级报纸，采取了提前派人到前几站去迎接列车的办法，在随车返回的途中，提前三十分钟将报纸分好，使报纸尽快投送出去……。
    长途话务员学习了先进操作方法以后，电路利用率已由上月的59％，提高到11月17日的64％左右，及时准确地疏通了长途电话。其他许多群英会上的先进经验，也正在我们这里开花结果。
