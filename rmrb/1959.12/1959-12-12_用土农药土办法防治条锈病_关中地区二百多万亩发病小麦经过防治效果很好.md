Using Indigenous Pesticides and Methods to Control Wheat Stripe Rust
Effective Control Achieved on Over Two Million Mu of Affected Wheat in the Guanzhong Region

    Xi'an Dispatch from Our Newspaper, December 11th: The winter campaign to control wheat stripe rust in the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi Province is in full swing. As of the end of last month, over 2.4 million mu of wheat fields in the Guanzhong region were affected by rust, and over 2.2 million mu have been treated. Generally, wheat fields with rust have been treated at least once, and areas with disease centers and severe infestations have been treated two or three times continuously, basically controlling the spread of the rust.

    This year, wheat rust in the Guanzhong region is very serious, but thanks to the extensive mobilization of the masses by the people's communes and the adoption of effective indigenous pesticides and methods, great achievements have been made. For example, Fengxiang County, which started the prevention and control work earlier, organized commune members to collect more than 600,000 jin of indigenous pesticides while sowing wheat, and the pesticide factories of various communes manufactured more than 3 million jin of indigenous pesticides. As of mid-November, they mainly used indigenous pesticides and methods to treat more than 118,000 mu of affected wheat fields.

    This year, most of the wheat fields with rust adopted the "soil burial and leaf cutting method," which involves cutting off and burying the diseased leaves first, and then cutting off all the wheat leaves within one foot of the surrounding area. When disease centers are found, the diseased leaves are cut off and buried, and then all the wheat leaves within three feet of the surrounding area are cut off and continuously sprayed with pesticides, with a control effect of up to 100%. Other indigenous pesticides such as "fresh urine water," "peach leaf water," "salt water," and "Ailanthus altissima leaf water" have high lethality to rust fungi. Among them, the killing effect of "fresh urine water" in a ratio of one to one is over 89%. Currently, the masses are actively carrying out winter irrigation and topdressing work in the wheat fields that have been treated, so that the wheat seedlings can regain their vitality within a few days.

    This year, the wheat sowing period in the Guanzhong region was about ten days earlier than in previous years. Because the climate is mild, it is most favorable for the germination of rust spores. According to the inspection results in various places, wheat stripe rust occurred earlier, spread more concentratedly, and spread faster than in previous years. The areas where stripe rust has developed more severely are Fengxiang, Qianxian, Binxian, Longxian, Baoji City, and Sanyuan area in western Guanzhong. The early-sown wheat here is generally affected by rust, and some wheat fields are severely affected, forming disease centers. According to an on-site inspection in Xingping County, in a 70-mu wheat field in Xibu Village, Yangling Commune, there were only two stripe rust disease centers and six single diseased leaves during the same period last year, but this year there are fourteen disease centers and twelve single diseased leaves. In Changwu Commune, Binxian County, individual plots have formed disease centers, seriously threatening the surrounding wheat fields.

    This year, the work of preventing and controlling wheat stripe rust in the Guanzhong region also started earlier than in previous years. As early as September this year, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry held a meeting to discuss the method of preventing and controlling rust mainly with "indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods," and made early arrangements for vigorously promoting indigenous methods and manufacturing indigenous pesticides. Subsequently, an on-site meeting was held in Fengxiang County with the participation of various cities and counties in Guanzhong and other relevant units. On-site experiments were conducted with various indigenous methods and indigenous pesticides, liberating the minds of the attendees and establishing confidence in defeating wheat stripe rust with indigenous methods and indigenous pesticides. All counties also held special work meetings and on-site meetings to prevent and control stripe rust, trained technical cadres and key personnel for preventing and controlling stripe rust, organized professional teams for preventing and controlling rust, and widely established rust monitoring points in areas where stripe rust has been serious in the past years. All production teams have established rust information officers to strengthen the monitoring and reporting of stripe rust. Once discovered, prevention and control measures are taken immediately. People's communes in various places have established indigenous pesticide factories and indigenous machinery factories, and mobilized the masses to collect various indigenous pesticides to prepare for the prevention and control of stripe rust. Fengxiang, Zhouzhi and other counties have held on-site meetings on preventing and controlling rust with indigenous methods, training technical personnel who have mastered the technology of preventing rust with indigenous methods and indigenous pesticides. Fengxiang County has also compiled 45 kinds of indigenous methods and indigenous pesticide materials for preventing and controlling stripe rust to facilitate learning and adoption by the masses.

### 用土农药土办法防治条锈病  关中地区二百多万亩发病小麦经过防治效果很好

    用土农药土办法防治条锈病
    关中地区二百多万亩发病小麦经过防治效果很好
    本报西安11日电　陕西关中地区冬季防治小麦条锈病的运动已全面展开。上月底统计，关中地区有二百四十多万亩麦田发生锈病，已有二百二十多万亩得到防治。一般的有锈病麦田，都防治了一次以上，传病中心和严重的地块都连续防治二、三次，基本上控制住锈病的蔓延。
    今年关中地区小麦锈病十分严重，但由于各地人民公社广泛发动群众，采用有效土药土法防治，取得了很大的成绩。例如防治工作进行较早的凤翔县，今年在种麦的同时，就组织社员采集了土农药六十多万斤，各公社农药厂制造土农药三百多万斤。截至11月中旬，他们以土农药土办法为主，防治了发病麦田十一万八千多亩。
    今年，大部有锈病的麦田，都采用了“埋土切叶法”，先将病叶切除埋掉，然后把周围一尺范围内的麦叶全部割掉。发现传病中心时，将病叶切除埋掉之后，将周围三尺范围的麦叶全部割掉，并用药剂连续喷射，防治效果可达100％。其他土农药如“生尿水”、“桃叶水”、“盐水”、“椿树叶水”等，对锈病菌都有较高的杀伤力。其中用一比一的“生尿水”杀伤效果在89％以上。目前，凡是经过防治过的麦田，群众又积极地进行冬灌、追肥等工作，使麦苗在几天内恢复元气。
    今年关中地区小麦播种期比往年提前了十天左右，因为气候温和，锈病孢子的萌发最为有利。根据各地检查结果来看，小麦条锈病比往年发生的早，传病集中，蔓延的快。条锈病发展较严重的是关中西部的凤翔、乾县、邠县、陇县、宝鸡市及三原地区，这里早播的小麦普遍发生锈病，部分麦田发病严重，并形成传病中心。据兴平县实地检查，杨陵公社西卜村一块七十亩大的麦田里，去年同时期只有两个条锈病的传病中心，六个单病叶片，今年有十四个传病中心，十二个单病叶片。邠县的长武公社个别田块已形成传病中心，严重威胁着周围麦田。
    今年关中地区防治小麦条锈病的工作也比往年早。早在今年9月，省农林厅就召开了防治条锈病的会议，专门研究了以“土法为主，土洋结合”防治锈病的方法，并及早布置了大力推广土法和制造土农药的准备工作。接着，又在凤翔县召开了关中各市、县和其他有关单位参加的现场会议，用各种土办法、土农药做了现场试验，使到会的人员解放了思想，树立以土法、土农药战胜小麦条锈病的信心。各县也都专门召开了防治条锈病的工作会议和现场会，训练了防治条锈病的技术干部和骨干人员，组织防治锈病的专业队，并在历年来条锈病严重的地区，普遍地建立了锈病测报点。各个生产队都建立了锈病情报员，加强条锈病的测报工作，一经发现，立即防治。各地人民公社都建立了土农药厂、土农械厂，并发动群众采集各种土农药，为防治条锈病做好准备。凤翔、盩厔等县都召开了土法防治锈病现场会议，训练掌握土法、土农药的防锈病的技术人员。凤翔县还编选了四十五种防治条锈病的土法和土农药材料，以便利群众学习和采用。（附图片）
