    The Party Branch Secretary Who Insists on Running the Factory with Diligence and Thrift
    Liu Xueguan
    Anyone who visits the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory in Hubei Province cannot help but praise this factory as a good example of running a business with diligence and thrift. However, when the workers talk about how Liang Yanbin, the party branch secretary of the factory, insisted on running the factory with diligence and thrift, they are even more impressed.

    Since the Party transferred Liang Yanbin to be responsible for leading the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory in 1953, she has been working selflessly for the Party with all her strength for several years. She unswervingly implements the Party's policies, implements the Party's mass line, sets an example in everything, shares weal and woe with the masses, and leads the masses forward. In her own words, "As a leader of an enterprise, one must always be a promoter." And that is exactly what she did.

    At the beginning of this year, some people in the factory had doubts about whether the factory could continue to leap forward in 1959. They believed that the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory only had one hundred and thirty manual iron-wood looms, and the technical conditions were very poor. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the output doubled, the profit increased by nearly two times, and the "double-layer" and "three-layer" weaving methods were successfully tested. In terms of variety, it has also leaped from weaving general patterned cloth and checkered cloth to being able to weave serge, khaki, and canvas. How can it leap forward again? Some people said: "I have looked all over the machine, and there is nothing more to 'reform'. If we want to 'reform', we can only dismantle it and replace it with foreign machines." But Liang Yanbin did not think so. She believed that there was no limit to the leap forward. If the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory wanted to develop, it had to change the backward state of manual operation. Since it was impossible to replace it with foreign machines at the moment, it could only rely on the workers to innovate technology. After Liang Yanbin focused on analyzing the opinions and requirements of the masses, she put forward a bold suggestion: to convert all manual looms to electric drive, and led the masses to make their own electrical switches and install them themselves. In less than three months, they did not ask the state for a single catty of iron or steel, and converted all the more than one hundred native looms to electric drive. This earth-shattering technical innovation movement brought fruitful results. In the first half of the year, the total output value of the factory doubled compared with the same period last year. Now, this factory has completed the annual production task one hundred days ahead of schedule.

    In the process of leading the enterprise, Liang Yanbin always started from diligence and thrift, considered the interests of the country and the collective, carefully calculated, and saved expenses. This factory was originally a joint venture of some private small factories and independent producers. All seven processes and six workshops of the factory were dilapidated houses scattered on several streets. In order to change this situation, last spring, the leaders of the higher authorities allocated them more than 23,000 yuan to build new factory buildings. When some people heard the news, they thought, "Now we have to build it well." However, Liang Yanbin thought: "Our factory's foundation is weak, and the fixed assets are only more than 11,000 yuan. In 1957, it only accumulated 27,000 yuan for the country. The Party cares about the development of our factory and the welfare of the factory workers, and has allocated so much money at once. Can we spend it all lavishly? No. We should still follow the principle of diligence and thrift." At the Party branch committee meeting, she inspired everyone to adhere to the principle of running the factory with diligence and thrift, and proposed that except for the upper beam of the house, which should be contracted to the construction company, the rest of the work, such as building walls, laying tiles, and installing doors and windows, should be done by themselves. She and the factory director took the lead in signing up as bricklayers. After publicizing the idea of building the factory with diligence and thrift among the masses, the masses became more enthusiastic and quickly threw themselves into the factory building activities. At night, lanterns and torches illuminated the way, and Liang Yanbin and the workers carried bricks, transported bricks, carried mud, and lifted sand together, working enthusiastically. After more than two months of hard work, they built thirty-three new factory buildings and repaired seven old factory buildings, spending only more than 9,000 yuan in total, saving nearly 14,000 yuan for the country.

    Every cadre in the factory participates in production, and workers are widely involved in the daily management of the work groups. A new atmosphere has been formed in the factory: "Do whatever needs to be done, manage whatever needs to be managed, catch up with the advanced, and oppose waste and conservatism." Liang Yanbin always influences, inspires, and helps others with her own exemplary actions. Wherever there are difficulties, she fights stubbornly with the masses. If the quality of the sizing yarn is not good, she and the factory director go to the sizing workshop to "cultivate experimental plots" and participate in labor until the problem is solved. If the canteen of the fourth workshop is not run well, Liang Yanbin goes to the kitchen to experiment. The first day passed, and the cooks thought that she would be busy cooking during the day and attending meetings at night, and could not get up early. Who knew that the next day, Liang Yanbin bought a basket full of fresh vegetables from the street at three o'clock in the morning. She did this for a week in a row, and the food became better. The vivid facts moved the cooks, and they guaranteed to her: "We will definitely learn from you."

    Her hard work and simple life style also deeply affect the workers of the whole factory. "Diligence and thrift in running the factory for the collective, personal diligence and thrift is the first priority, a cotton-padded coat worn for seven years, patched up and patched up is better than a new one." This is the workers' praise for Liang Yanbin. Many people always take Liang Yanbin as an example when doing ideological work. When the weaving worker Xiao Jincai got married, his fiancée Zhong Mingpei wanted this and that. His companions advised her: "Look at Secretary Liang, the clothes she wore when she got married still had patches! The gray cotton-padded coat she is wearing now was issued in 1950." After such persuasion, Zhong Mingpei didn't want anything. Even many workers' parents often use Liang Yanbin's example of diligence and thrift to educate their children.

    In the factory, Liang Yanbin appears as an ordinary worker and gets along with the workers like relatives. Most of the female workers affectionately call her "Third Sister", young workers and new workers call her "Master Liang", and some older workers call her by her nickname "Third Girl".

    When people praise her deeds, she always says: "All I have done is what a Communist Party member should do."

    坚持勤俭办厂的支部书记
    刘学冠
    凡是到湖北襄樊棉织厂参观的人，都无不称赞这个厂是勤俭办企业的好典范。但是，当工人们谈起这个厂的党支部书记梁彦斌坚持勤俭办厂的时候，更使人钦佩。
    从1953年党调梁彦斌负责领导襄樊棉织厂起，几年来，她一直竭尽全力、忘我地为党工作。她坚定不移地执行党的方针政策，执行党的群众路线，处处以身作则，与群众同甘共苦，领导群众前进。用她自己的话说：“作为企业的领导者，必须永远当促进派。”她正是这样做的。
    今年年初，厂里曾有人对本厂1959年能不能继续跃进，抱怀疑态度。他们认为：襄樊棉织厂总共只有一百三十台铁木手工织布机，技术条件很差，在去年大跃进中，产量翻了一番，利润增长了将近两倍，试验成功了“双层”、“三层”织布法；在品种方面，也从织一般花色布、格子布，跃进到能织人字呢、卡叽、帆布，还怎样再跃进呢？有人说：“我把机子的浑身上下都看遍了，再没有什么‘改’头了，要‘改’，只有拆了换洋机器。”可是梁彦斌并不这样想。她认为跃进没有止境，襄樊棉织厂要发展，就要改变人工操作的落后状态，而换洋机器目前又不可能，只有依靠职工革新技术。梁彦斌集中分析了群众的意见和要求以后，提出了一个大胆的建议：把手工织布机全部改用电力带动，并带领群众自打电开关，自己安装，不到三个月的功夫，他们没有向国家要一斤铁、一斤钢，就把一百多部土织布机全部改为电力带动。这场翻天复地的技术革新运动，带来了丰硕之果。上半年，全厂产值比去年同期翻了一番，现在这个厂已提前一百天全面完成了今年全年的生产任务。
    梁彦斌在领导企业的活动中，处处从勤俭出发，为国家着想、为集体着想，精打细算，节约开支。这个厂原来是由一些私营小厂和独立生产户合营起来的，全厂七道工序、六个车间都是些破旧的民房，分散在几条街上。为了改变这种状况，去年春天，上级领导机关拨给了他们二万三千多元资金，兴建新厂房。一些人听到这个消息，以为“这下子得好好兴建一番了”。然而梁彦斌却想：“我们厂的底子薄，固定资金不过一万一千多元，1957年一年才为国家积累资金二万七千元。党为了发展我们这个厂，关怀厂的职工，一下子就拨了这么多钱，能大手大脚的把它都花掉吗？不能。还是应该本着勤俭的原则办事。”在党支部委员会上，她启发大家坚持勤俭办厂的原则，并提出除屋的上梁部分包给建筑公司外，其余垒墙、盖瓦、安装门、窗，一律自己动手干。她和厂长带头报名当泥瓦工。经过在群众中宣传勤俭建厂的思想，群众劲头更大，迅速投入了建厂活动。夜晚，灯笼、火把照着亮，梁彦斌和工人一起搬砖、运砖、挑泥、抬砂，干得热火朝天。奋战两个多月，他们建造了三十三间新厂房，修理了七间旧厂房，一共只花了九千多元，为国家节约资金近一万四千元。
    这个厂全厂每个干部都参加生产，同时广泛地吸收工人参加班组的日常管理工作。全厂已经形成了这样一种新风气：“见活就干、见事就管、见先进就赶、见浪费保守就反。”梁彦斌处处以自己的模范行动去影响、启发和帮助别人，那里有困难，她就和群众一道顽强地战斗在那里。浆纱的质量不好，她就和厂长一块到浆纱车间“种试验田”，参加劳动，直到问题解决为止。四车间的食堂办的不好，梁彦斌就下到厨房作试验。第一天过去了，炊事员以为她白天作饭、夜晚开会，不能起早。谁知第二天清早三点多钟，梁彦斌就从街上买回了满满一篮鲜菜。这样一连做了一个星期，伙食变好了。生动的事实感动了炊事员，向她提出保证：“一定照你的样子学。”
    她在生活作风上的艰苦朴素，也深深影响着全厂职工。“勤俭办厂为集体，个人勤俭数第一，一件棉袄穿七年，补补连连赛新衣。”这是工人们对梁彦斌的赞语。很多人在作思想工作时，总是拿梁彦斌作例子。织布工人萧进才结婚时，他的未婚妻钟明佩要这要那，同伴们劝她说：“你看梁书记，结婚时穿的衣服还有补绽疤哩！人家现在穿的那件灰棉袄还是1950年发的。”这样一劝说，钟明佩就啥也不要了。甚至连许多工人的父母，也常拿梁彦斌勤俭节约的榜样，教育自己的子女。
    在厂里，梁彦斌以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和工人相处如亲人。多数女工都亲切地喊她“三姐”，青年工人和新工人们称她为“梁师傅”，而一些年纪大的老工人们就叫她的小名“三妞”。
    当人们赞扬她的事迹的时候，她总是说：“我所作的一切，不过是一个共产党员应该作的罢了。”
