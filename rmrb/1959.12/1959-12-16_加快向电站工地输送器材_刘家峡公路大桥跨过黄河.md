Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 15th: The reinforced concrete highway bridge built in Liujiaxia on the upper reaches of the Yellow River has recently been officially completed, and the project quality has fully met the design requirements.

The Liujiaxia Highway Bridge is 85.6 meters long and is the transportation hub from Lanzhou to the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station under construction. In the past, due to the lack of a bridge, the transportation of construction equipment to the hydropower station construction site was done by ferry, and the transportation volume was small and could not keep up with the needs of the project. The completion of the Liujiaxia Highway Bridge means that a large amount of construction equipment can be transported to the hydropower station construction site through this bridge, which will greatly accelerate the construction speed of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station.

The team responsible for the construction of this bridge was the directly affiliated engineering team of the Second Engineering Division of the Xining Railway Bureau. They adopted rapid construction methods and launched a mass rationalization proposal campaign. The entire project took only forty-two days, ensuring the early completion of the bridge.

### 加快向电站工地输送器材  刘家峡公路大桥跨过黄河

    加快向电站工地输送器材
    刘家峡公路大桥跨过黄河
    据新华社西宁15日电　在黄河上游刘家峡建设的钢筋混凝土公路桥已在最近正式建成，工程质量全部达到设计要求。
    刘家峡公路桥全长八十五点六米，是兰州通向正在建设的刘家峡水电站的交通咽喉。过去由于没有大桥，向水电站工地运送建筑器材都是用渡船，运量小赶不上工程的需要。刘家峡公路大桥的建成，大批建筑器材就可通过这座大桥源源运往水电站工地，将大大加快刘家峡水电站的建设速度。
    担负这座大桥施工任务的是西宁铁路局第二工程处直属工程队。他们采取了快速施工法和开展了群众性的合理化建议运动，整个工程只用了四十二天，保证了大桥提前建成。（附图片）
