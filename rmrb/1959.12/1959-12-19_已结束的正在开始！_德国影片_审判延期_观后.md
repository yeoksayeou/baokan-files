The postponed trial concerns the following case: Phil Grant, a British Jew, returns to West Germany, where he used to live, and kills his enemy, Dr. Koren, a former Nazi who is now a high-ranking State Secretary. This causes a great uproar in the West German political and legal circles.

At first glance, the film involves complex aspects and a large number of characters. Almost all of them meet Phil Grant by chance, and many ordinary men and women are involved in this entanglement rather suddenly. Some of them do not even have direct contact with this entanglement from beginning to end. However, as the case becomes clearer and the nature of this entanglement is gradually revealed, these accidentally involved factors gradually transform into firm forces necessary for this struggle. Everyone, including Phil Grant himself, increasingly feels that this entanglement is a severe test of justice, conscience, and the purpose of life. This entanglement unambiguously reveals to them what kind of changes are taking place in the world they live in. This entanglement also makes many of them thoughtfully consider whether the things they bled and fought for more than a decade ago still exist…

Everything boils down to one sentence: "The road starting here is exactly the same as the one that ended ten years ago!"

This is a revelation given to Phil Grant by a German communist when he is imprisoned awaiting trial.

The entire key to the Phil Grant case lies in this sentence and the person who said it to him.

The West German authorities feigned seriousness in investigating the details of Phil Grant's murder. They hid evidence favorable to him and prevented testimonies favorable to him, determined to convict him of intentional murder. It seems that these disguised Nazis are mourning the death of a rabbit and seeking revenge for their deceased colleague. However, they are not at all mourning the dead but attempting to frame others, using this personal revenge incident to expand into a huge political conspiracy, thereby achieving the West German authorities' goal of persecuting and suppressing the Communist Party.

Under the conscious or unconscious efforts of many people, out of justice or other motives, the truth of the case is finally made known to the public, and the trial has to be postponed. However, just as postponement does not equal cancellation, that huge political conspiracy is still looking for another opportunity. Of course, things are not so negative. After all, people have come to know the society and themselves in this process, and this understanding should be a huge force. The struggle is not over.

The characters in the film illustrate this point.

Marie, who has lived half her life in the ruins of war, seeks inspiration for artistic creation and her ideal man from her imagination. However, she immediately falls in love with the unfortunate Phil Grant, and for him, she dedicates her memorable property and her freedom. It seems accidental, but I wonder if it wasn't because he killed the resurrected Nazi? Perhaps she wouldn't have made such a firm choice! It was probably that gunshot that awakened her, allowing her to find the answer she had been searching for in her imagination: what, who, took away everything she once had?! Why can she only live in imagination?! This shot made her understand what she should do and how to live.

British journalist Grosell bombed Fascist Germany with the Allied Air Force during the war. However, he has found that the raging flames beneath his feet did not kill the Nazis, and what chills him the most is that when he attempts to continue exposing the Nazi conspiracy, the response he gets from his country and newspaper is: “Do not obstruct” what West Germany is doing. He refuses the boss's transfer without regret and prepares to continue the fight.

As for the warden who succumbed to reality, after making many compromises with reality, he finally realizes that this is a complete betrayal of his original ideals. Therefore, to a certain extent, he helps Phil Grant, and eventually he leaves the judicial circle, that increasingly clear source of evil.

These are very tortuous characters, but they are all closely related to the main conflict of the film, explaining the social impact of this conflict. Through their development, people can clearly see what is growing.

Things are probably not as simple as imagined by the West German special agent Zeffert, who resembles a reincarnation of the "House Un-American Activities Committee," because "the ended is starting" has two meanings: one is the revival of the Nazis; the other is that the people have restarted the struggle!

    已结束的正在开始！
    ——德国影片“审判延期”观后
    丘扬
    被延期的这个审判，案情如下：英籍犹太人菲尔甘特，回到了他居住过的西德，杀死了他的仇人科伦博士，后者是从前的纳粹分子，现在却是高踞要津的国务秘书。于是，这就在西德的政法界引起一场轩然大波。
    乍一看去，影片涉及的方面比较复杂，出场的人物也比较众多，几乎所有的人物都是和菲尔甘特萍水相逢的，许多平凡的男女差不多都是在很突然的机会中卷进了这场纠葛，有的甚至自始至终都没有和这场纠葛发生直接的联系，然而随着案情的逐步清晰，随着这场纠葛的实质的逐渐显露，这些偶然卷进来的因素，也逐渐地转化成为这场斗争所必须的坚定的力量。每一个人，甚至包括当事人菲尔甘特在内，都在越来越分明地感觉到：这场纠葛是对于正义、良心、和生活的目的的严峻考验；这场纠葛毫不含糊地向他们显露出了他们所生活的那个世界，正在发生着什么样的变化；这场纠葛也使得他们当中的许多人沉思地考虑到，十多年前为之流血、为之战斗的事物，到底是不是存在的……。
    一切归结于这样一句话：“目前这里开始的道路，跟十年前结束的完全一样！”
    这是当菲尔甘特关在监牢里听候审讯时，一个德国共产党人向他提出的启示。
    菲尔甘特案件的全部关键，就在于这句话，以及向他说这句话的这个人身上。
    西德的当权者像煞有介事地追究菲尔甘特杀人的详情，他们隐藏了有利于他的证据，杜绝了有利于他的证词，一定要置诸他以有意谋杀的地步而后快。看起来，好像这些改头换面的纳粹分子，是为了兔死狐悲，因而渴欲为自己去世的同僚复仇，然而他们一点也不是为了悼念死者，而是企图嫁祸于人，利用这样一件私人的复仇事件，扩大成为一个巨大的政治阴谋，从而达到西德当局迫害和镇压共产党的目的。
    在许多人自觉或不自觉地、出于正义或者其他的努力底下，案情的真实情况终于让社会知晓了，审判不得不宣布延期。然而，正如它并不等于取消一样，那个巨大的政治阴谋仍然在寻找着另一个机会。事情当然不是那么消极，毕竟，人们在这个过程中认识了社会、也认识了自己，这个认识，就该是个巨大的力量。斗争并没有结束。
    说明了这个道理的，是影片中的人物。
    半生生活在战争废墟中的玛里，从自己的幻想中，寻找艺术创造的灵感、寻找自己理想的男人，然而，她一下子就爱上了遭难的菲尔甘特，为了他，献出了自己有纪念意义的房产，以及自己的自由。看起来像是偶然的，然而，我在想，如果不是由于他杀死了复活的纳粹呢？也许她不会抉择的如此坚定吧！大概正是由于那一声枪响，震醒了她，让她找到了她在幻想中一直找寻的那个答案：是什么，谁，夺去了她曾经有过的一切？！为什么她只能是在幻想中讨生活？！这一枪让她明白了她到底该做什么，怎么生活。
    英国记者格罗赛尔，战时，他随着盟国空军轰炸过法西斯德国，然而至今他发现，当初在他脚下的腾空烈焰并没有把纳粹烧死，而最最使他胆战心寒的是，当他企图继续揭露纳粹的阴谋时，从他的国家、报纸所得到的反应是：西德正在进行的一切：“不要受到妨碍”。他毫不惋惜地拒绝了老板的调职，准备继续战斗。
    至于那个屈服在现实面前的监狱长，在向现实做了许多妥协之后，终于发现这是对于自己当初理想的整个背叛，因而在一定程度上他帮助了菲尔甘特，最终自己也脱离开了司法界，那个越来越鲜明的罪恶渊薮。
    这是些很曲折的性格，然而他们都和影片的主要纠葛息息相通，为这个纠葛的社会影响作出了说明，通过了他们的发展，人们也可以清楚地看到有什么东西在生长。
    事情恐怕不像那位，俨然是“非美活动调查委员会”再版的西德特务则弗特想像的那么简单，因为“已经结束的，正在开始”有两个含义，一个是纳粹复活；一个是人民重新开始了斗争！
