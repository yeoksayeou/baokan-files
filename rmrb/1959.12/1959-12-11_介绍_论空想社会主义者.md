    Introducing "On Utopian Socialists"
    Authored by Soviet scholar V.P. Volgin, Translated by the Compilation Office of Renmin University of China. By Li Sizu.
    The works of Western European utopian socialists are numerous, varied, and their content systems are extremely chaotic, often leaving readers feeling lost and without a clue. In the twenty essays of this book, Academician Volgin presents a well-organized and easy-to-understand introduction to the doctrines of eighteen utopian socialists. He also analyzes the historical background and social foundations of the various utopian socialist doctrines from a historical materialist viewpoint. The utopian socialist trend of thought arose under the conditions where capitalist production relations had already emerged, but the proletariat was not yet mature. It reflected, to varying degrees, the dissatisfaction of the oppressed and their desire to change the old system. Moreover, the author points out that the earliest people to discuss socialist and communist principles were intellectual workers. They were able to stand on the side of the oppressed masses because they were determined by the material living conditions of the lower intellectual class. However, due to the special social position of intellectuals, while safeguarding the interests of workers, they inevitably reflected the special aspirations of the intellectual labor stratum in their propositions.
    When commenting on the doctrines of each utopian socialist, the author closely grasps the origins and relationships of these thinkers' doctrines. At the same time, the author points out that when these thinkers accepted the ideas of their predecessors, they transformed them according to the requirements of the times and the requirements of the social classes they represented. For example, Morelly's "Code of Nature" had a significant influence on Babeuf's doctrine. However, between Morelly and Babeuf, there was the French bourgeois revolution. Therefore, Babeuf was bound to transform the views of his predecessors and formulate his own plan.
    Regarding several issues in the history of socialist thought that need further exploration, Volgin puts forward his own opinions through fairly in-depth analysis. For example, regarding whether Plato was a socialist, Volgin's opinion is negative. He said that Plato represented the interests of the declining aristocracy at that time. He attempted to use a system of consumptive communism to prevent the decline of the aristocracy, which was a reactionary aspect. However, Plato undoubtedly had a considerable influence on the formation of the ideas of early utopian socialists. Regarding why Saint-Simon would merge the proletariat and the bourgeoisie into an industrialist class, Volgin pointed out that the class relations in France in the early nineteenth century were not mature enough, which may be one reason; and more importantly, Saint-Simon wanted to prove that there were no class contradictions in his ideal social system established in a peaceful manner.
    The author also discusses the historical role and historical limitations of these utopians. Under the historical conditions at that time, utopian socialists reflected the dissatisfaction and aspirations of the broad masses of working people, and paved the way for the emergence of later scientific communism, and therefore had a progressive role. However, due to the limitations of historical conditions, they could not find a way to reform the old social system, and at the same time, their plans for reforming society generally had defects such as egalitarianism, asceticism, and reconciliation of class contradictions. Therefore, with the growth and maturity of the proletariat, the progressive role of the utopian socialist theoretical system gradually disappeared, and some later utopian socialist schools became reactionary sects.
    Volgin's book can be used as a guide for beginners for readers who have never studied utopian socialist doctrines; and readers who are already familiar with this doctrine can also gain a lot of inspiration from it.

    介绍“论空想社会主义者”
    苏联维·彼·沃尔金著　中国人民大学编译室编译  李斯祖
    西欧空想社会主义的著作，数量多，种类杂，内容体系极为紊乱，常使读者感到茫无头绪。沃尔金院士在他这本书的二十篇论文中，对十八位空想社会主义的学说作了条理分明、深入浅出的介绍。还用历史唯物主义的观点，分析了各种空想社会主义学说产生的时代背景和社会基础。空想社会主义的思潮是在资本主义生产关系已经出现、而无产阶级尚未成熟的条件下产生的。它在不同的程度上反映了被压迫者不满和要求改变旧制度的愿望。并且，作者指出，最早论述社会主义和共产主义原则的人都是一些脑力劳动者，他们之所以能够站在被压迫的群众方面，是为下层知识分子的物质生活条件所决定的。然而，由于知识分子所处的特殊社会地位，他们在维护劳动者利益的同时，不可避免地在自己的主张中反映出脑力劳动这一阶层的特殊愿望。
    作者在评述每一空想社会主义者的学说时，都紧紧地把握住这些思想家的学说的渊源关系。同时，作者指出，这些思想家在接受其先驱者的思想时，都是按照时代的要求和他们所代表的社会阶层的要求进行了改造的。例如，摩莱里的“自然法典”对巴贝夫的学说有显著的影响。但是，在摩莱里和巴贝夫之间隔着一次法国资产阶级革命。因此，巴贝夫势必要对前人的观点加以改造，并制定出自己的方案。
    对于社会主义思想史上若干需要进一步探讨的问题，沃尔金通过相当深刻的分析，提出了自己的见解。例如，关于柏拉图是不是一个社会主义者，沃尔金的意见是否定的。他说，柏拉图代表了当时趋于没落的那个贵族阶层的利益，他企图用消费性共产主义的制度来防止贵族的没落，这是反动的一面。但是，柏拉图对于早期空想社会主义者的思想的形成，又无疑地起了相当大的影响。关于为什么圣西门会把无产者和资产者归并到一个实业家阶级里，沃尔金指出，十九世纪初法国的阶级关系不够成熟，这可能是一个原因；而更重要的原因是圣西门想证明在他的以和平方式建立的理想社会制度中没有阶级矛盾。
    对于这些空想家的历史作用及其历史局限性，作者也作了论述。空想社会主义者在当时的历史条件下，反映了广大劳苦群众的不满情绪和愿望，为后来科学共产主义的出现开辟了道路，因而是有进步作用的。但是，由于历史条件的限制，他们找不到改革旧社会制度的途径，同时在他们的改革社会的方案中普遍地有平均主义、禁欲主义和调和阶级矛盾等缺陷。因此，随着无产阶级的壮大和成熟，空想社会主义理论体系的进步作用便日益消失，后来的一些空想社会主义学派便成为反动的宗派了。
    沃尔金的这本书对于从来没有研究过空想社会主义学说的读者，固然可以作为入门的指导；就是对这种学说素有研究的读者，也可以从中得到不少启发。
