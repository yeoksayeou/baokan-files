    “The People’s Commune Greatly Liberated Productive Forces,” this investigative report vividly depicts how the people's communes in our country's rural areas fully adapted to the requirements of productive force development: under the situation of the all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in 1958, the original advanced cooperatives could no longer fully adapt to the requirements of new productive force development and needed adjustment and innovation; and once the people's commune, this new production relationship and new organizational form, was established, it immediately promoted the vigorous development of productive forces. The people's commune unfolded the wings of agricultural production, embarking on a journey of ten thousand miles with limitless prospects.

    In socialist society, production relations are adapted to the development of productive forces, but they are not yet perfect, and therefore contradict the development of productive forces; when contradictions occur, they are promptly and consciously adjusted and resolved, creating conditions for each other's continuous development: this is the dialectic of productive forces and production relations in socialist society. This report uses a large number of vivid and rich facts to prove this dialectical relationship, thereby proving that the people's commune is a product of objective necessity.

    A small handful of right-leaning opportunists in our country maliciously attacked the people's commune movement, saying that the people's commune "surpassed the level of productive forces," and "the current rural productive forces are still very low, with no tractors, no chemical fertilizers, and no electrification... how can it be said that the emergence of the people's commune is a requirement of productive force development?" The facts of the Changjiang People's Commune powerfully answered this nonsense.

    Productive forces include two basic elements: one is the means of production used in producing material goods, and the other is the people who use the means of production. Means of production cannot automatically produce; they must be operated by people to become a real productive force; therefore, Lenin said that people are the most basic productive force. To simply attribute productive forces to means of production (such as tractors) and use this to criticize the people's commune shows a fundamental lack of understanding of political economy. Those who hold this view only "see things, not people" and fail to see the high degree of awareness and creativity of the more than 500 million peasants under the leadership and education of our Party.

    Let us take a concrete look at the development of productive forces in rural areas.

    Before the establishment of the Changjiang Commune, the advanced cooperatives had already purchased a lot of new agricultural machinery such as tractors and water pumps. This shows that the means of production have greatly increased in recent years. However, because the cooperatives were small and had little capital, they "had money to buy horses but not to equip them," and could not well meet the requirements of productive force development. Even if a complete set of new farm tools was bought, there were still "knots" that were difficult to untie, such as interspersed fields, high fields, and low fields; the water system could not be planned uniformly, canals could not be dug in large quantities, and water pumps could not be used; cooperatives with tractors could not fully utilize the tractors because of their small scope of activity, while cooperatives without tractors had difficulties in cultivation due to the large amount of land and the small amount of labor. It can be seen that although the advanced cooperatives had many advantages over the primary cooperatives, there were still cases of things not being used to their full potential and land not being cultivated to its full potential. To develop and utilize agricultural machinery more quickly, it is necessary to further adjust production relations, just as things evolved later, from advanced agricultural cooperatives to people's communes.

    Looking at the organization of labor, the several production units of the Changjiang Commune, although the organization of labor was much stronger than that of the primary cooperatives in the advanced cooperative stage, still could not fundamentally solve the contradiction of too much land and too few people; therefore, they were too busy with farm work alone, with "sixteen cooperatives short of about 1.1 million workdays throughout the year"; the existing manpower could not be fully utilized. This is called people not being able to give full play to their talents. Moreover, the Great Leap Forward has arrived, requiring intensive cultivation, the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects, the simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and the establishment of some industries to achieve a technological revolution... All of these directly and indirectly impacted the rural labor force. What to do? It is necessary to find ways to liberate female labor, to rationally use existing talents, to cultivate new talents, to implement cooperation, and so on. The development of productive forces has put forward a series of new requirements. In the final analysis, the production relations of advanced agricultural cooperatives can no longer meet the needs of further development of productive forces, and it is necessary to "go to a higher level," improve production relations, and further liberate productive forces. And the peasants took action to reform and adjust, and the people's commune, this new production relationship, emerged on the horizon like the rising sun. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee promptly discovered this new thing, strongly supported it, and promoted it, forming the great people's commune movement. This is precisely the product of "emerging in response to the times" under the leadership of the Communist Party. How can there be talk of "too early," "surpassing," or "unsuitable?" This is truly absurd.

    The people's commune is the inevitable product of economic and political development in our country. Chairman Mao once pointed out in "On Contradiction" that between productive forces and production relations, productive forces generally manifest the main and decisive role; whoever does not recognize this is not a materialist; however, "when productive forces cannot develop without changing the production relations, the change in the production relations plays the main and decisive role." From the development process of the people's commune, we can see that it was the advanced agricultural production cooperatives that nurtured new productive forces, and these new productive forces required a new production relationship that was compatible with it—the people's commune. We only adjusted the production relations that should be adjusted in a timely manner according to the requirements of objective development, and carried out the realization of this task to the end. This is the attitude of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries. What else can the right-leaning opportunists' opposition to the people's commune explain other than that they adopted a bourgeois master-like attitude towards new things and the great mass movement?

    是“超越”还是适应？
　  郑史
    “人民公社大大解放了生产力”，这篇调查报告，生动地描绘了我国农村的人民公社完全适应生产力发展的要求：在1958年社会主义建设全面大跃进的形势下，原来的高级社已不能完全适应新的生产力发展的要求了，需要调整和革新；而一经建立了人民公社这种新的生产关系和新的组织形式，它就马上反过来促进了生产力的蓬勃发展。人民公社展开了农业生产的翅膀，正是鹏程万里，前途无量。
    在社会主义社会，生产关系同生产力的发展是相适应的，但它还不够完善，因而同生产力的发展又相矛盾；矛盾发生了，又及时地自觉地调整和解决了，互相为对方的不断发展创造条件：这就是社会主义社会生产力和生产关系的辩证法。这篇报告用大量生动的丰富的事实，证明了这种辩证关系，从而证明了人民公社乃是客观必然性的产物。
    我国的一小撮右倾机会主义分子，恶意地攻击人民公社运动，说什么人民公社“超越了生产力水平”，“现在农村生产力还很低，一没有拖拉机，二没有化学肥料，三没有电气化……这怎么能说人民公社的出现是生产力发展的要求呢？”长江人民公社的事实，有力地回答了这派胡说。
    生产力包括两个基本的要素，一个是生产物质资料时所使用的生产工具，另一个是使用生产工具的人。生产工具不可能自动进行生产，必须由人来操纵，才能变成现实的生产力；所以列宁才说人是最基本的生产力。如果把生产力单纯地归结为生产工具（例如拖拉机），并以此来责难人民公社，这是根本不懂得政治经济学。持这种观点的人，只是“见物不见人”，看不见五亿多农民在我们党的领导和教育下，有着何等高度的觉悟性和创造性。
    让我们具体地看一看农村生产力发展的情况罢。
    长江公社成立以前，各高级社已经买了不少拖拉机、抽水机等新式农业机器。这表明几年来生产工具已经大有增加了。但因社小资金少，“有钱买马，无力置鞍”，还不能很好地满足生产力发展的要求。即使买到了整套的新式农具，又有插花田、高田、低田等难以解开的“疙瘩”，水系无法统一规划，渠道不能大量开挖，抽水机用不上；有拖拉机的社，因为活动范围小，不能充分发挥拖拉机的作用，而没有拖拉机的社，地多劳力少，耕种还有困难。可见高级社尽管比初级社有了很多优越性，但仍然存在物不能尽其用，地不能尽其力的情况。要更快地发展和利用农业机械，就必须进一步调整生产关系，正像事情在后来的演变那样，从高级农业社走向人民公社。
    再从劳动力的组织情况来看。长江公社的几个生产单位，在高级社时，虽然劳动力的组织比初级社时强得多了，但还不能根本解决地多人少的矛盾；所以光是农活就忙不过来，“十六个社全年缺工在一百一十万个左右”；现有的人力，也不能充分发挥其能力。这叫做人不能尽其才。何况大跃进又来了，要求深耕细作，要兴修较大的水利工程，要农林牧副渔五业并举，还要举办一些工业，实现技术革命……所有这些，又都直接间接地冲击着农村的劳动力。怎么办呢？要设法解放妇女劳动力，要合理地使用原有人材，要培养新的人材，要实行协作，等等。生产力的发展，提出了一系列新的要求，归根结底是高级农业合作社这种生产关系，已经不能满足生产力进一步发展的需要了，必须“更上一层楼”，改进生产关系，进一步解放生产力。而农民也就动手革新和调整了，人民公社这种新的生产关系才像旭日东升一样冒出在地平线上。毛主席和党中央及时地发现了这一新生事物，大力支持，推而广之，形成了伟大的人民公社化运动。这正是在共产党领导下的“应运而生”的产物，又何来“早了”、“超越了”、“不适合呀”之说？真是奇谈怪论。
    人民公社是我国经济和政治发展的必然产物。毛主席在“矛盾论”中曾经指出，生产力和生产关系之间，生产力一般地表现为主要的决定的作用，谁不承认这一点，谁就不是唯物论者；然而，“当着不变更生产关系，生产力就不能发展的时候，生产关系的变更就起了主要的决定的作用。”从人民公社的发展过程中，我们可以看出正是高级农业生产合作社，孕育了新的生产力，而这种新的生产力，要求有一种与它相适应的新的生产关系——人民公社。我们只是根据客观发展的要求及时地调整了应当调整的生产关系，并把这一任务的实现贯彻到底。这是马克思列宁主义不断革命论者的态度。而右倾机会主义分子反对人民公社，除了说明他们对新生事物和伟大的群众运动采取了资产阶级老爷式的态度，还能说明什么呢？
