　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 25th: Sichuan Province's industrial sector has conscientiously implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, winning high-speed development in industrial production. By December 21st, the province's total industrial output value had completed the state plan ahead of schedule. The output of major products has increased significantly compared to last year. For example, pig iron production in the first eleven months of this year increased by 114.8% compared to the entire year of last year.
　　This year, in the spirit of the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China not only focused on the production and construction of large enterprises but also on the technical transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, it launched mass movements on various industrial fronts, carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, and improved production levels, greatly changing the face of the province's industry. For example, in the iron and steel industry, in addition to the new development of the Chongqing Iron and Steel base, the newly built Chengdu Iron and Steel Plant, Jiangyou Iron and Steel Plant, and others have successively been put into production. Each of the province's thirteen special districts has established its own small iron and steel base, and the number of iron-smelting counties has increased from a dozen to more than one hundred. Now, the province has formed an iron and steel industrial network with large enterprises as the backbone and a combination of large, medium, and small enterprises, changing the past situation where the iron and steel industry was concentrated in a few areas. Driven by the iron and steel industry, other industries have also achieved leap-forward results. Small coal and coke production bases have been established near the province's "small foreign groups" of iron and steel bases. The machinery industry this year manufactured complete sets of large equipment such as converters, electric furnaces, blast furnaces, mining and excavation equipment, and transportation equipment, equipping the iron and steel, coal, and other industries. This year, the province's light industrial products have also achieved 70% self-sufficiency.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 25th: The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Shandong Province, holding high the red flag of the Party's general line for socialist construction, have completed the province's annual industrial output value plan ahead of schedule. As of December 20th, the province's completed industrial output value exceeded the state plan by 6.2%. The output of 116 major products, including steel, pig iron, steel products, raw coal, coke, cement, sulfuric acid, chemical fertilizer, power machinery, machine tools, printed and dyed cloth, vegetable oil, and cigarettes, have all exceeded the annual plan and have increased significantly compared to last year.
　　A comprehensive leap forward has emerged on the industrial front in Shandong Province this year. Not only has the output of products increased significantly, but also remarkable achievements have been made in improving quality, reducing costs, and expanding product varieties. According to statistics on 33 major industrial products, the quality of 27 products has exceeded last year's level. The comparable cost of all industrial products from January to October decreased by 13.95% compared to the same period last year. Many industrial products that could not be produced in the province in the past can now be produced this year.
　　Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party, all the workers on the industrial front in Shandong Province have deeply carried out the six-comparison red flag competition centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. Especially after the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, the workers became even more motivated, thereby promoting a straight upward trend in production.
　　The reason why Shandong Province's industrial production has achieved such significant results this year is also due to the firm implementation of a series of "walking on two legs" policies, such as combining indigenous methods with foreign methods and combining large, medium, and small enterprises. Pig iron produced by small and medium-sized iron-smelting blast furnaces of three cubic meters and thirteen cubic meters in the province accounts for about two-thirds of the province's total pig iron production. The output of county and commune small coal mines is equivalent to 73% of the province's coal output in 1957.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 24th: Henan Province had exceeded this year's industrial output value plan by 25.81% by December 20th. The output plans for more than fifty major products have been completed ahead of schedule, including raw coal, pig iron, steel, coke, cement, timber, large agricultural machinery, gas engines, boiler-camel machines, power generation equipment, machine-made paper, soap, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, soda ash, caustic soda, and so on. This year's industrial production in Henan Province has three prominent characteristics: First, the increase in heavy industry production, especially raw material production, is particularly rapid. Second, many production projects have grown from nothing to increasing strength, such as coal tar, petroleum, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, potassium nitrate, and other products that were not available last year but can be produced this year. The Yang steel and steel products that were produced in small quantities last year can be produced in large quantities this year. Third, there are many varieties, and 600 new products have been added this year.
　　The resolute implementation of a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies is a decisive factor for the continued leap forward in industrial production in Henan Province this year. Taking steel production as an example, in addition to building medium-sized joint enterprises like Anyang Iron and Steel Company, the province currently has 61 "small foreign group" iron and steel plants and iron-smelting plants that have been developed from the "small indigenous groups" through rectification and technical transformation, becoming an important force in the province's steel production. The small coal mines operated below the special district level, after varying degrees of technical transformation, have also reached more than 40% of the province's raw coal output.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 25th: Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, the broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Jilin Province have completed this year's industrial output value plan thirty days ahead of schedule. As of December 20th, the province's completed industrial output value has exceeded the annual plan by 7.1%. The output of 34 major products, including steel, pig iron, steel products, automobiles, diesel engines, synthetic ammonia, and calcium carbide, has all exceeded the annual plan one after another. The output of various major industrial products that have been produced this year has increased significantly compared to the great leap forward year of 1958. Among them, raw coal, steel, steel products, and pig iron have all increased by more than 30% compared to last year.
　　The biggest characteristic of the industrial front in Jilin Province this year is the realization of a comprehensive leap forward that is more, faster, better, and more economical. In addition to the large increase in output value and output, the cost of comparable products in local industries in the first eleven months of this year decreased by 6.3% compared to the same period last year. Product quality has been greatly improved. The average qualification rate of pig iron in the province reached 90.25% in November, an increase of 5.54% compared to September. The variety of industrial products has also increased significantly.
　　At the beginning of this year, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all workers in the province at the provincial conference of advanced industrial producers to carry out a production increase and economy practice movement with high output, high quality, low cost, and safe production as its content. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, industrial enterprises in the province launched a struggle against rightist tendencies, further boosting the revolutionary spirit of the workers throughout the province and promoting a monthly increase in production levels. Taking total industrial output value as an example, it increased by 6.5% in August compared to July, 19.6% in September compared to August, 10.8% in October compared to September, and another 10.8% in November compared to October.
　　On the basis of vigorously carrying out mass movements, industrial enterprises in Jilin Province have also strengthened enterprise management. Since the beginning of this year, party committees at all levels have taken the lead, with secretaries taking charge, personally grasping daily progress, focusing on key points, and grasping coordination, going deep into the front line to lead production, thus ensuring the continued leap forward of industrial production in the province on the basis of last year's leap forward.
　　Currently, industrial and mining enterprises in Jilin Province are mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of this year's comprehensive leap forward and discussing and formulating next year's production plan, as well as specific measures to ensure the completion of these plans.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 25th: Jiangxi Province has completed its 1959 industrial output value and major product output plans ahead of schedule and exceeded them. According to statistics from the Provincial Planning Commission as of December 15th, the province's annual industrial output value plan has been exceeded by 0.2%. The output of 35 major products, including pig iron, coal, timber, power machinery, electricity generation, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn, have been completed 15 days to one month ahead of schedule. These products have all increased significantly compared to last year. Taking coking raw coal as an example, it has increased by 72% compared to last year. The quality of all products has reached the specified standards.
　　The Party's battle call to oppose rightist tendencies, boost morale, and practice strict economy in increasing production is a huge driving force for Jiangxi Province to complete this year's industrial output value and other plans ahead of schedule and exceed them. In the high tide of the production increase and economy practice movement, party secretaries of various regions and industrial departments went to the front line of production, participated in production command, and worked with workers to break through production key points. Secretaries and members of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also frequently went deep into key factories and mines such as iron and steel and coal to command production.
　　Currently, on the basis of completing the industrial production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it, the workers on the industrial front throughout the province are vigorously preparing for a continued leap forward next year, determined to win a good start next year.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 25th: The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have worked hard, practically, and skillfully, completing the region's annual industrial output value plan ahead of schedule. By the end of November, the region's total industrial output value had exceeded the annual plan by 5.8%. The output plans for 56 major products, including pig iron, raw coal, manganese ore, gold, paper, cigarettes, and gas engines, have also been exceeded. The output of all products has increased significantly compared to last year, with raw coal alone increasing by 32.7% compared to the entire year of last year.
　　Guangxi's industrial achievements this year have been made under the leadership of the Party, continuously opposing rightist tendencies and boosting morale. As early as the beginning of the year, the Autonomous Region Party Committee called on all workers in the region to achieve a continued leap forward on the basis of last year's great leap forward. From January to May, the industrial system in the region corrected the slack mood that had appeared in some enterprises around the Spring Festival and launched a production increase and economy practice movement. After the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, the workers further launched a socialist labor competition high tide centered on high output, high quality, high efficiency, low cost, and good safety and good cooperation, so that the region's industrial production steadily increased month by month, ensuring a comprehensive great leap forward that was more, faster, better, and more economical.
　　Now, the industrial workers of the Autonomous Region are making persistent efforts with greater enthusiasm, actively preparing for production, and ensuring a good start next year.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, December 25th: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region completed this year's industrial output value plan forty days ahead of schedule. The total output value completed from January to November exceeded the annual plan by 10.06%. The region has exceeded the annual plans for 14 major products, including coke, crude oil, pig iron, and sulfuric acid, and has greatly exceeded the level of 1958.
　　From the beginning of the year, the Party committees at all levels in the Autonomous Region have adhered to putting politics in command, continuously criticizing rightist conservative ideology, and leading workers of all nationalities to carry out a production increase and economy practice movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. Party and government leading cadres in many units have gone deep into the front line of production, discovered problems and solved them in a timely manner, so that production has increased month by month. Especially since August, inspired by the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, workers of all nationalities have further carried out the production increase and economy practice movement, and reports of production successes have continued to pour in. After entering December, many factories and mining enterprises have successively completed the annual production plan comprehensively and ahead of schedule.
　　Currently, workers of all nationalities are seizing the last few days of this year to create conditions for next year's production, so that next year's production will have a good start and be red every month.

　　辽宁　四川　山东　河南　吉林　江西　广西　新疆大中小企业比翼齐飞
    八省、区提前突破全年工业总产值指标
    生产水平超过去年　主要产品增长很大　新的品种不断涌现
　　四川
    新华社成都25日电　四川省工业部门认真贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，赢得了工业生产的高速度发展。今年全省工业生产总值到12月21日已提前完成了国家计划；主要产品的产量都比去年有很大增长，例如今年十一个月的生铁就比去年全年的产量增长114.8％。
    中共四川省委今年根据全国一盘棋的精神，既抓大型企业的生产建设，又抓中小型企业的技术改造，同时在各个工业战线大搞群众运动，开展技术革新和技术革命，提高生产水平，大大改变了全省工业的面貌。比如在钢铁工业方面，除了重庆钢铁基地有了新的发展以外，新建的成都钢铁厂、江油钢铁厂等都相继投入生产，全省十三个专区都已分别建立起自己的小型钢铁基地，炼铁县份由十几个发展到了一百多个。现在，全省已经形成一个以大型企业为骨干、大中小型企业相结合的钢铁工业网，改变了过去钢铁工业只集中在少数地区的状况。在钢铁工业的带动下，其他工业也都获得了跃进的成果。全省“小洋群”钢铁基地附近，都已建立起小型煤焦生产基地。机械工业今年制造了转炉、电炉、高炉、矿山采掘、交通运输等成套大型设备，装备了钢铁、煤炭等工业。今年全省轻工业品也已作到了70％自给。
　　山东
    新华社济南25日电　山东省工业战线广大职工高举党的社会主义建设总路线红旗，提前完成全省年度工业总产值计划。到12月20日止，全省已完成的工业总产值比国家计划超过了6.2％。全省钢、生铁、钢材、原煤、焦炭、水泥、硫酸、化肥、动力机械、机床、印染布、植物油、卷烟等一百一十六种主要产品产量，也都超额完成了年度计划，并且比去年有很大增长。
    山东省工业战线今年出现了全面跃进局面。不仅产品产量有了很大增长，在提高质量、降低成本和扩大产品品种等方面，也都取得了显著成就。据三十三种主要工业产品统计，有二十七种产品质量超过了去年的水平；1月到10月全部工业产品的可比成本，比去年同期降低了13.95％；过去省内不能生产的好多工业产品，今年已能生产了。
    今年以来，山东省工业战线全体职工在党的领导下，深入开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的六比红旗竞赛，特别是在党的八届八中全会的号召发布以后，职工们干劲更大，从而促进了生产直线上升。
    山东省工业生产今年所以能获得如此重大成绩，还在于坚决贯彻了土方法和洋方法并举、大中小企业相结合等一系列两条腿走路的方针。全省三立方米和十三立方米的中小炼铁高炉生产的生铁，约占全省生铁总产量的三分之二。县社小煤窑的产量相当于1957年全省煤产量的73％。
　　河南
    新华社郑州24日电　河南省到12月20日已经超额25.81％完成今年的工业总产值计划；有五十多种主要产品的产量计划已经提前完成，其中包括原煤、生铁、钢、焦炭、水泥、木材、大型农业机械、煤气机、锅驼机、发电设备、机制纸、肥皂、硫酸、盐酸、纯碱、烧碱等等。今年河南省的工业生产有三个显著特点：一是重工业生产，特别是原材料生产的增加特别快。二是许多生产项目从无到有和日益壮大，如去年没有的煤焦油、石油、硫酸、硝酸、硝酸钾等产品，今年都能生产了；去年少量生产的洋钢和钢材，今年能大量生产了。三是品种多，重要的新产品今年就增加了六百种。
    坚决贯彻执行一整套两条腿走路方针，是河南省今年工业生产继续跃进的一个决定性因素。以钢铁生产为例，除了建设像安阳钢铁公司那样的中型联合企业外，目前全省还拥有从“小土群”基础上经过整顿和技术改造发展起来的“小洋群”钢铁厂和炼铁厂六十一座，成为全省钢铁生产中的重要力量。专区以下经营的小型煤矿，经过不同程度的技术改造以后，生产能力也已占到全省原煤产量的40％以上。
　　吉林
    新华社长春25日电　吉林省工业战线广大职工在党的总路线光辉照耀下，提前三十天超额完成了今年工业总产值计划。到12月20日止，全省完成的工业总产值已经超过年度计划7.1％。全省钢、生铁、钢材、汽车、柴油机、合成氨、电石等三十四种主要产品的产量，都先后超额完成了年度计划。全省今年已经生产出的各种主要工业产品，产量都比大跃进的1958年有很大增长，其中，原煤、钢、钢材和生铁等，都比去年增长30％以上。
    吉林省今年工业战线的最大特点，是实现了多快好省的全面跃进。除了产值和产量获得大量增长以外，今年前十一个月地方工业可比产品成本比去年同期降低6.3％。产品质量有很大提高。全省生铁合格率11月份平均达90.25％，比9月份提高了5.54％。工业产品品种也有很大增长。
    今年一开始，中共吉林省委在全省工业先进生产者代表会议上，就号召全省职工开展以高产优质低成本和安全生产为内容的增产节约运动。党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，全省工业企业开展了反右倾斗争，进一步鼓舞了全省职工的革命干劲，促使生产水平逐月上升。以工业总产值为例，8月比7月提高6.5％，9月比8月提高19.6％，10月比9月提高10.8％，11月比10月又提高10.8％。
    在大搞群众运动的基础上，吉林省工业企业还加强了企业管理工作。今年以来，各级党委由书记挂帅，亲自抓日进度、抓重点、抓协作，深入第一线领导生产，因而保证了全省工业生产在去年跃进的基础上继续跃进。
    目前，吉林省工矿企业正在发动群众总结今年全面跃进的经验；讨论和制定明年生产计划，以及保证完成这些计划的具体措施。
　　江西
    新华社南昌25日电　江西全省1959年的工业总产值和主要产品产量计划，都已提前超额完成。据省计划委员会到12月15日止的统计，全省年度工业总产值计划已超额0.2％；生铁、煤炭、木料、动力机械、发电量、棉布、棉纱等三十五项主要产品产量，都分别提前十五天到一个月完成。这些产品都比去年有了很大的增长。以炼焦原煤为例，就比去年增长72％。各项产品的质量都达到了规定标准。
    党的反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的战斗号召，是推动江西省提前超额完成今年工业总产值等计划的巨大动力。在增产节约运动高潮中，各地区、各工业部门的党委书记亲临生产第一线，参加生产指挥生产，同工人一道突破生产关键；中共江西省委的书记、委员，也都经常深入钢铁、煤炭等重点厂矿指挥生产。
    目前，全省工业战线上的职工在提前超额完成工业生产计划的基础上，正在大力做好明年继续跃进的准备工作，决心夺取明年开门红。
　　广西
    新华社南宁25日电　广西僮族自治区工业战线广大职工苦干、实干、巧干，提前完成了全区工业总产值年计划。到11月底，全区工业总产值已超过年度计划5.8％；生铁、原煤、锰矿、黄金、纸、卷烟、煤气机等五十六种主要产品的产量计划，也都超额完成。各项产品产量都比去年有很大增长，其中仅原煤就比去年全年增长32.7％。
    今年广西工业取得巨大成绩，是在党的领导下，不断反右倾、鼓干劲的结果。早在年初，自治区党委就号召全区职工要在去年大跃进的基础上实现继续跃进。1月至5月，全区工业系统纠正了春节前后某些企业一度出现的松劲情绪，开展了增产节约运动。党的八届八中全会的号召发出以后，职工们进一步掀起了以高产、高质、高效率、低成本和安全好、协作好为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛高潮，使全区工业生产月月稳步上升，保证多快好省地实现了全面大跃进。
    现在，自治区工业职工正以更大的干劲，再接再厉，积极作好生产准备，保证实现明年开门红。
　　新疆
    新华社乌鲁木齐25日电　新疆维吾尔自治区提前四十天完成了今年的工业总产值计划。1月到11月完成的总产值，超过了年度计划10.06％。全区有焦炭、原油、生铁、硫酸等十四种主要产品超额完成了年度计划，并且大大超过了1958年的水平。
    自治区各级党委从年初一开始，就坚持政治挂帅，不断批判右倾保守思想，领导各民族职工开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。许多单位的党政领导干部都深入生产第一线，及时发现问题解决问题，使生产月月上升。特别是8月份以来，在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，各民族职工进一步开展了增产节约运动，生产捷报不断传来。进入12月以后，许多厂矿企业陆续提前全面完成全年生产计划。
    目前，各民族职工正抓紧今年最后几天时间，为明年的生产创造条件，使明年的生产开门红、月月红。（附图片）
