    1959 Was a Year of Surging Workers' Movements in Capitalist Countries
    The Working Class Engages in Heroic Struggles Against Monopoly Capital
    According to Xinhua News Agency, 1959 was a year of surging worker struggles in capitalist countries.

    Throughout this year, the American working class's fight against monopoly capital has truly been constant, wave after wave. The U.S. Department of Labor admitted that the scale of strikes in the first half of this year exceeded that of the same period in any of the past four years. In the second half of the year, there was a major strike by 500,000 steelworkers and several other large-scale strikes. Even according to the Labor Department's reduced official statistics, the United States saw a total of 3,525 strikes in the first ten months of this year, involving 1.9 million workers, resulting in a loss of 62.5 million working days.

    This year, American workers also waged struggles around the issues of opposing unemployment and defending trade unions and the democratic rights of the working class. The American Unemployed Workers' Conference held in Washington on April 8, attended by 10,000 people, was the largest anti-unemployment demonstration by American workers since the 1929-1933 Great Depression. On Labor Day, September 7, a demonstration parade was held in New York with 105,000 union members participating, protesting against Congress passing new anti-labor laws.

    The 500,000 steelworkers' strike that broke out on July 15 was a major struggle this year by the American working class against the monopoly bourgeoisie. This strike lasted nearly four months, the longest strike in the history of the American steelworkers' struggle. During the strike, U.S. basic steelmaking capacity decreased by 87%, and monopoly capital and government tax revenues together lost $3.1 billion. U.S. President Eisenhower finally revealed his ferocious nature and personally invoked the reactionary Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to force the steelworkers back to work.

    The copper miners' strike in August and the East Coast dockworkers' strike in October were also two large-scale strikes. The copper miners' strike brought U.S. copper production to a near standstill, and the dockworkers' strike paralyzed all ports along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts, with more than 190 ships frozen in New York Harbor alone. The dockworkers' strike was also only interrupted after Eisenhower invoked anti-labor laws to interfere.

    In the major capitalist countries of Western Europe, the number of workers participating in struggles this year far exceeded that of previous years. In France, the number of working days lost due to worker strikes in the first quarter of this year exceeded the total number of working days lost throughout last year; in Italy, the number of strikers by the end of July reached 8.3 million, far exceeding the 6 million for the entire year of last year; in the United Kingdom, according to the Labor Department's materials, 5 million working days were lost due to strikes in the first nine months of this year, about 50% more than the total for the whole of last year; In West Germany, unions already have ten million employees, half of the total number of employees in West Germany, and have announced the abolition of old contracts expiring at the end of this year and the beginning of next year, and demanded wage increases in the new contracts.

    The enormous scale of worker struggles is also reflected in the fact that entire industries often participate in the struggles. In France, where the vital interests of the working masses have been harmed by de Gaulle's policies, a very wide range of workers have been involved in this year's struggles. One million people participated in the 24-hour general strike in early December by civil servants and state-owned enterprise employees demanding a 12% wage increase; 350,000 people participated in the railway workers' struggle in November demanding an 11% wage increase.

    Strike struggles were very active in Italy this year. In early June, the largest seamen's strike in Italian trade union history broke out, with 60,000 seamen persisting in a 40-day strike, halting more than 100 ships connecting Italy with 15 domestic and foreign routes, with capitalists suffering losses of $400 million. The striking workers resolutely resisted the Italian government's conscription orders attempting to undermine the strike, rendering it ineffective. During the new labor-capital contract negotiations from April to July, workers in many industries held nationwide strikes to fight for higher wages and improved living conditions, many of which were successful. The largest were the general strike of 1.5 million metalworkers and three general strikes of 400,000 textile workers. During the strikes, workers in many factories and mines engaged in heroic struggles with the military police sent to suppress them.

    In Belgium and West Germany, which were severely affected by the coal crisis, coal miners vigorously resisted the capitalists' attempts to shift the losses of the crisis. In Belgium, miners in Borinage in the south held a strike at the beginning of the year to protest the closure of mines and the dismissal of workers, which rapidly developed into a general strike of 140,000 coal miners nationwide and received support from workers in other industries. Although this major strike did not fully achieve its goals due to the betrayal of right-wing union leaders, it greatly shocked the Belgian government. Since the beginning of this year, West German coal miners have been constantly protesting in various ways against the coal companies' measures such as closing mines and rotating shutdowns, which threaten the lives of miners. The anger of West German miners was concentrated in the demonstration march "Marching on Bonn" on September 26. On that day, 60,000 miners marched in a thirteen-column formation stretching four kilometers through downtown Bonn, the largest demonstration in Bonn in the ten years since the establishment of the West German government.

    The main goals of British workers' struggles this year were to implement a 40-hour work week and increase wages in the face of capitalists' increased labor intensity for workers. Shipyard workers, mechanics, auto workers, railway workers, etc., have all put forward the above demands. 150,000 printing workers went on a major strike lasting a month and a half from mid-June to fight for these demands. This largest strike in the British printing industry in more than 30 years brought British national printing companies to a near standstill, with about 1,100 local newspapers and weekly magazines ceasing publication.

    Workers in Western European countries have strengthened their united action in this year's struggles, a trend that is particularly evident in France. The united action of French trade unions has reached the highest level this year since the split of the trade union movement by the Socialist Party in 1946. Although the upper-level leaders of the French Socialist Party trade unions and Catholic trade unions stubbornly refused to cooperate with the French General Confederation of Labor, unified action agreements between the three major trade unions have been reached in 81 of the 90 provinces at the provincial level; among national industrial trade unions, industrial trade unions affiliated with the French General Confederation of Labor have also achieved unified action with more than 30 industrial trade unions belonging to other trade union systems.

    In many cases, Western European workers have further touched on the political causes threatening workers' lives in this year's economic struggles. Some workers in France, Italy, and Belgium have raised slogans against the implementation of "Common Market" policies in the movement against dismissals and closures of enterprises, and many French workers have linked the demands for increased wages and the protection of social welfare with opposition to de Gaulle's policies and demands to end the Algerian war.

    1959年是资本主义国家工人运动汹涌澎湃的一年
    工人阶级同垄断资本展开英勇搏斗
    据新华社讯　1959年是资本主义国家工人阶级斗争汹涌澎湃的一年。
    在今年一年中，美国工人阶级对垄断资本的斗争真是此伏彼起，一浪接一浪。美国劳工部承认，今年上半年罢工的规模超过了过去四年中任何一年的同一时期。而在下半年，又发生了五十万钢铁工人的大罢工和其他一些大规模的罢工。即使根据劳工部缩小了的官方统计，在今年头十个月中，美国共发生了三千五百二十五起罢工，参加罢工的人数达一百九十万，由于罢工而损失的工作日达六千二百五十万个。
    美国工人今年还环绕着反对失业、保卫工会和工人阶级民主权利这两个方面开展了斗争。4月8日在华盛顿召开的有一万人参加的美国失业工人大会，是1929—1933年资本主义世界经济大危机以来美国工人规模最大的一次反失业大示威。9月7日美国劳工节在纽约曾举行了有十万五千工会会员参加的示威游行，反对国会通过新的反劳工法。
    7月15日爆发的五十万钢铁工人大罢工，是今年美国工人阶级反对垄断资产阶级的一场主要斗争。这次罢工坚持将近四个月，是美国钢铁工人斗争历史上时间最长的一次罢工。在罢工期间，美国基本炼钢能力减少了87％，垄断资本的利润和政府的税收一共损失三十一亿美元。美国总统艾森豪威尔最后凶相毕露，亲自出来援引反动的塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法，强制钢铁工人复工。
    8月铜矿工人的罢工和10月东海岸码头工人的罢工也是两次规模巨大的罢工。铜矿工人的罢工使美国铜业生产几乎全部停顿，码头工人的罢工使美国大西洋和墨西哥湾沿岸的港口全部瘫痪，仅是纽约港内就有一百九十多条轮船被冻结。码头工人的罢工也只是在艾森豪威尔引用反劳工法来干涉罢工以后才中断的。
    在西欧几个主要资本主义国家中，今年参加斗争的工人远比往年为多。法国今年第一季度因工人罢工而损失的工作日就比去年全年损失的工作日还多；意大利截至今年7月中止罢工人数已达八百三十万人次，大大超过去年一整年的六百万人次；在英国，据劳工部的材料，今年头九个月因罢工损失了五百万个工作日，比去年全年的还多50％左右；西德目前已经有拥有一千万职工、即西德职工总数的一半的工会，宣布废除在今年底和明年初到期的旧合同，并且要求在新合同中规定增加工资。
    工人斗争的巨大规模也表现在往往是整个行业的工人都参加了斗争。在工人群众切身利益受到戴高乐政策之害的法国，极为广泛的工人卷入了今年的斗争。有一百万人参加了12月初的公务人员和国营企业职工要求增加工资12％的二十四小时总罢工；有三十五万人参加了11月间铁路工人要求增加工资11％的斗争日。
    意大利今年罢工斗争十分活跃。6月初爆发了意大利工会史上最大的一次海员罢工，六万海员坚持了四十天的罢工，使联结意大利国内外十五条航线的一百多艘船只停驶，资本家损失达四亿美元。罢工工人坚决反抗意大利政府企图破坏罢工的征调令，使它未能发生效果。在4月到7月进行新的劳资合同谈判期间，许多行业的工人举行了全国性的罢工，争取提高工资和改善生活条件，其中不少取得了胜利。规模最大的有一百万五金工人的总罢工和四十万纺织工人的三次总罢工。在罢工期间，许多厂矿的工人同派来镇压他们的军警展开了英勇搏斗。
    在受到煤业危机严重影响的比利时和西德，煤矿工人对资本家想转嫁危机损失的企图进行了有力的反抗。比利时南部波里纳吉矿工为了抗议关闭矿井和解雇工人在年初举行了罢工，罢工迅速发展成为全国十四万煤矿工人的总罢工，并且得到其他行业工人的支援。这次大罢工尽管由于右翼工会领袖的叛卖行为没有完全达到目的，却使比利时政府受到很大震动。西德煤矿工人今年以来不断以各种方式抗议煤矿公司的关闭矿井和轮班停工等使矿工生活遭受威胁的措施，西德矿工的愤怒集中地表现为9月26日“向波恩进军”的示威游行。那一天，六万矿工排成长达四公里的十三路纵队穿过波恩市区，这是西德政府成立十年来在波恩最大的一次示威游行。
    英国工人今年主要的斗争目标是要求在资本家加强了工人劳动强度的情况下实行四十小时工作周和增加工资。造船工人、机械工人、汽车制造工人、铁路工人等都提出了上述要求。十五万印刷工人为了争取这些要求从6月中开始举行了历时一个半月的大罢工。这一次英国印刷业三十多年来最大的罢工，使英国全国印刷公司几乎完全停工，约有一千一百种地方报纸和周刊停止出版。
    西欧各国工人在今年的斗争中加强了统一行动，这种趋势在法国特别明显。法国工会的统一行动今年达到了从1946年社会党分裂工会运动以来的最高水平。尽管法国社会党工会和天主教工会的上层领导顽固地拒绝同法国总工会合作，但是在省一级全国九十个省中已经有八十一省达成了三大工会统一行动的协议；在全国性产业工会之间，法国总工会所属的产业工会也已经同三十多个属于别的工会系统的产业工会实现了统一行动。
    在不少场合，西欧工人在今年的经济斗争中已经进一步触及了威胁工人生活的政治原因。法国、意大利和比利时一些工人在反对解雇和关闭企业的运动中提出了反对执行“共同市场”政策的口号，许多法国工人已经把要求增加工资和保卫社会福利同反对戴高乐政策和要求停止阿尔及利亚战争联系起来。（附图片）
