This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Harbin on the 26th: Party organizations at all levels in Heilongjiang Province, in this year's water conservancy project construction, adhering to the spirit of "grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other," have arranged the construction site life very well, which has played a great role in boosting the migrant workers' vigorous morale and continuously improving labor efficiency.

Currently, Heilongjiang Province is in the midst of a severe winter season with rivers frozen and snow flying, but the nearly ten thousand water conservancy construction sites that have already started are warm as spring. The 750,000 water conservancy workers who have arrived at the construction sites are living in warm houses, sleeping on heated brick beds, with roaring fires inside, which is very warm; in the construction site canteens, the migrant workers can not only eat hot meals, but also have a variety of dishes that suit their tastes, some with one dish and one soup, and some with two dishes and one soup. At the same time, many service industries have been set up on the construction sites, such as sewing, laundry, and barbering, etc. Many construction sites have also carried out rich and colorful cultural activities. Some construction site migrant workers can watch a movie once a week.

The biggest feature of Heilongjiang Province's arrangement of water conservancy construction site life this year is that it started early. Some places started preparing as early as the summer. For example, the Jianshan Reservoir in Keshan County built 134 houses on the construction site in the summer, built 455 heated brick beds, and prepared 300,000 bundles of firewood. All communes gave priority to solving the cotton-padded clothing, cotton shoes, and cotton hats for the water conservancy workers, and delivered non-staple foods to the construction site in advance, sending more than 200,000 catties of vegetables and 70 fattened pigs. After the start of construction, in order to facilitate the lives of the migrant workers, four supply and marketing stores and ten sewing and shoe repair groups were established, and twenty barbers were organized to be stationed at the construction site; nine boiling water stations were set up on the construction site to ensure that the migrant workers had hot water to drink. At the same time, a broadcasting station was established, and all squadrons were equipped with amplifiers. The twelve theater troupes organized by the Keshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China often came to the construction site to perform; the library and club were extremely active every evening. Therefore, everyone is full of energy and high in morale, and the average work rate has increased from one cubic meter at the beginning to three cubic meters.

In order to ensure the health of the vast number of migrant workers and ensure safe production, all construction sites have universally carried out winter patriotic health campaigns, actively doing a good job in environmental and personal hygiene. Generally, health clinics have been established at all construction sites, and thousands of medical personnel throughout the province are active at the construction sites, providing mobile treatment and responsible for hygiene work. Doctors at the Weihe County Satellite Canal construction site are contracting areas and providing mobile inspections and treatment. The migrant workers here have already achieved warm clothing, hot water for hands in the evening to avoid frostbite and cracked hands; resting for ten minutes after work before eating; having haircuts and washing and drying clothes and bedding on time; keeping the room clean; and keeping the heated brick beds warm and the house warm without smoke, preventing poisoning or influenza.

　　一面抓施工  一面抓生活
    吃饱穿暖住好  文娱卫生样样周到
    黑龙江安排民工生活好
    人人干劲更足水利工效不断提高
    本报哈尔滨26日电　黑龙江省各级党组织在今年兴修水利工程中，本着“一手抓生产一手抓生活”的精神，工地生活安排得很好，对鼓舞民工旺盛的斗志，不断提高劳动效率，起了很大作用。
    目前，黑龙江省正是江河封冻，瑞雪纷飞的隆冬季节，但是在近万处已经开工的水利工地上却是温暖如春。已经到达工地的七十五万水利大军，都住上了温暖的房舍，睡上了火炕，室内的炉火熊熊，非常暖和；在工地的食堂里，民工们不仅可以吃到热菜热饭，而且花样多，适合民工口味，有的是一菜一汤，有的是两菜一汤。同时，工地上还设有许多服务性行业，如缝纫、洗衣、理发等等，许多工地还开展了丰富多采的文化生活。有的工地民工一星期就能看上一次电影。
    黑龙江省今年安排水利工地生活，最大一个特点是动手早，有些地方早在夏季就开始准备了。如克山县的尖山水库，在夏季就在工地上修建了一百三十四间房屋，搭上四百五十五铺火炕，准备好烧柴三十万捆。各公社都优先解决水利大军的棉衣、棉鞋、棉帽，提早把副食品送到工地，仅蔬菜就送去二十多万斤，已育肥猪七十口。开工以后，为了便利民工生活，又建立了四个供销店和缝纫部、修鞋组十个，组织了二十名理发员常驻在工地；工地上设立了九处开水站，保证民工有热水喝。同时还建立了广播站，各中队都安上了扩大器。中共克山县委组织的十二个剧团经常来工地演出；图书馆、俱乐部每到晚间极为活跃。因此，人人干劲十足，个个斗志昂扬，平均工率从开始时的一公方提高到三公方。
    为了保证广大民工的身体健康，安全生产，各工地都普遍开展了冬季爱国卫生运动，积极搞好环境卫生和个人卫生。一般工地都建立了卫生所，全省有几千名医疗人员活跃在各工地上，巡回治疗和负责卫生工作。讷河县卫星运河工地医生分片包干、巡回检查治疗，这里的民工已经做到穿的暖和，晚间用热水烫手，以免皮肤冻伤和裂手。下工后休息十分钟再吃饭；按时理发、洗晒衣被；室内经常保持清洁；炕热屋子暖、不冒烟，防止中毒或流行性感冒。
