　　Mountain Village
　　Soldier Li Shuren
　　Dawn, the bugle call shook down the stars in the sky. …
　　Creak! The mountain village's wooden gate opened. The soldiers came out, some rushing to the well, others sweeping the streets. The sound of the broom and the sound of the pulley broke the silence of the night.
　　The sun rose. The Young Pioneers, carrying their schoolbags, walked towards the school. Seeing the soldiers, they first gave a salute, then said, "Hello, Uncle!" The commune's female cook came out to carry firewood. The soldier carrying water smiled and said to her, "Sister-in-law! You don't need to add water to the pot when you cook; we'll add it for you."
　　The sun rose higher. The commune's bell rang loudly. The commune members went to work, chatting and laughing. At this time, the bright bugle call also sounded, and the soldiers rushed to the training ground. …
　　Dusk, how peaceful the mountain village is! Only the grasshoppers are chirping. However, the patrolling soldiers are all moving around. When they pass by someone's doors and windows, they lighten their footsteps, fearing to disturb the children's sweet dreams.
　　Only one house's window still glows with light. Inside the house, there is an old woman with graying temples, mending a faded military uniform. The night wind, mixed with sand, blew against the window paper. The early winter wind is so cold! However, the old woman didn't care; she only focused on her work, each stitch and thread so meticulous.
　　The night is deep. After the deep night comes dawn, and another joyful day of labor is coming. …

　　山村
　　战士  李树人
    黎明，军号声震落了满天星斗。……
    吱呀呀！山村的柴门敞开了。战士们出来了，有的向井台奔去，有的在打扫街道，扫帚的声音，辘轳的声音，打破了一夜的寂静。
    太阳出来了。红领巾们背着书包向学校走去，见了战士们，先敬一个礼，然后说一声：“叔叔好！”社里的女炊事员出门抱柴禾了，挑水的战士笑着对她说：“大嫂！你做饭的时候不用往锅里添水了，我们替你添上了。”
    太阳升高了，社里的大钟在当当响，社员们说说笑笑出工了，这时，嘹亮的军号也哒哒地吹了起来，战士们向预习场奔去了。……
    黄昏，山村多么平静啊！只有草虫儿在叫。然而，巡逻的士兵都在游动着，当他们走过谁家的门窗，把脚步放得更轻了，生怕惊扰了孩子们的美梦。
    只有一家的窗户还透着灯亮。屋里，有位两鬓斑白的老大娘，在缝补一件褪了色的军衣。夜风夹杂着沙粒，吹打着窗纸，初冬的风好凉啊！然而，老大娘没有在意，她只顾做活，一针一线，是那样精细。
    夜深了。深夜过去就是黎明，又一个欢快的劳动日就要来了。……
