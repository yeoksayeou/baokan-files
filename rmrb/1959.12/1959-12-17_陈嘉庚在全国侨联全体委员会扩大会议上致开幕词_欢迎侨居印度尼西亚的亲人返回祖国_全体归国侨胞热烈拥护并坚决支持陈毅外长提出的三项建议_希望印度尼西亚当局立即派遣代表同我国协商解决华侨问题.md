Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th - The First Session, Fourth Plenary Meeting of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Expanded Committee opened in Shanghai today.

Present at the meeting were Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Vice-Chairmen Fang Fang, You Yangzu, Wang Yuanxing, Zhuang Xiquan, Zhuang Mingli, Chen Qiyuan, Huang Changshui, and Yi Meihou, as well as members of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and advanced model figures from returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese from all over the country, totaling 436 people.

Chen Jiageng delivered an opening speech at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th - The full text of the opening speech delivered by Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, at the First Session, Fourth Plenary Meeting of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Expanded Committee is as follows:

The First Session, Fourth Plenary Meeting of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Expanded Committee is now open. Today, we also have with us responsible comrades from relevant departments of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government. Their presence to provide guidance is a great encouragement to us. On behalf of all the committee members and representatives attending the meeting, I would like to extend a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to them.

A few days before the opening of our meeting, we saw Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on the comprehensive resolution of the issue of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. This letter fully demonstrates the sincerity of our government in safeguarding the friendship between China and Indonesia and its consistent position in protecting the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese. The letter sternly condemns and protests the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities that have emerged in Indonesia, and puts forward three reasonable proposals for a comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue, hoping that the Indonesian government will immediately appoint representatives to consult with representatives of our government on resolving the Overseas Chinese issue. In addition to suggesting that the two governments resolve the issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese as soon as possible, and requesting the Indonesian government to earnestly protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter specifically mentioned that for those Overseas Chinese who are displaced or unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia, our government is prepared to arrange for them to return to China to participate in construction according to their wishes, and hopes that the Indonesian government will send them back to China in stages and batches in accordance with fair and reasonable principles. This not only expresses the infinite concern of the 650 million people of the country for Overseas Chinese, but also fully reflects the wishes and voices of the vast number of Overseas Chinese. We, all the returned Overseas Chinese, express our warm endorsement and firm support for these proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi on behalf of our government.

The entire nation of returned Overseas Chinese expresses strong protest against the recent anti-China and anti-Chinese movements in Indonesia and gratitude to the Indonesian people for their sympathy and support for the Overseas Chinese.

Since May of this year, an adverse current of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment has emerged in Indonesia. This adverse current, after the publication of the joint communique between Foreign Minister Chen Yi and Foreign Minister Subandrio on maintaining and developing friendly relations between the two countries and rationally resolving the Overseas Chinese issue, has not only not subsided, but has intensified. Certain forces hostile to the friendship between China and Indonesia have taken advantage of the decree prohibiting foreign small retailers from doing business outside the capitals of first and second-level autonomous regions and states, concentrating their efforts on attacking Overseas Chinese, forcing them to move out of their original places of residence, causing serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, and seriously infringing upon their personal safety. A large number of Overseas Chinese are displaced and have no means of livelihood. What is particularly infuriating is that, in the process of forced relocation, the military and police were dispatched to fire shots, forcibly pull pregnant women and patients onto vehicles, beat and insult Overseas Chinese, and not allow those who were injured to be sent to hospitals for treatment, resulting in serious bloodshed. Recently, Overseas Chinese have been arbitrarily arrested and subjected to inhumane torture. In order to safeguard their own survival, the local Overseas Chinese have repeatedly appealed to the local government for protection and an end to the persecution, but to no avail. In order to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, our government has repeatedly urged the Indonesian government to pay attention, and our embassy and consulates in Indonesia have also repeatedly made representations and protests to the Indonesian government. However, the Indonesian authorities turned a deaf ear and, contrary to international practice, unreasonably restricted the legitimate activities of our embassy and consulate personnel. Not only that, but certain Indonesian newspapers and periodicals, in order to incite anti-China sentiment and coordinate with anti-Chinese activities, also disseminated a large number of slanders and defamatory remarks against our country, and even publicly insulted our people's beloved leaders, seriously hurting the feelings of the Chinese people. This serious anti-China and anti-Chinese activity in Indonesia, which seriously damages the friendship between the two countries, is not only intolerable to the Chinese people, but has also aroused unease and dissatisfaction among fair-minded people and the broad masses of the Indonesian people. Today, the returned Overseas Chinese who have already received the warm care of the motherland, are particularly sympathetic to the Overseas Chinese who are currently being persecuted in Indonesia. I represent all returned Overseas Chinese in extending our cordial greetings to them and lodging a serious protest against the various persecutions they have suffered. I would also like to represent all returned Overseas Chinese in expressing our heartfelt thanks to the Indonesian people for their sympathy and support for the Overseas Chinese.

History shows that Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people have forged a bond of shared hardship and struggle in their common life and common struggle. The current anti-China movement is a completely ungrateful act of treating friends as enemies.

Chinese nationals have resided in Indonesia for more than 1,500 years. During this long period, Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people have lived together in close harmony, and have made indelible contributions to the economic and cultural development of Indonesia with their hard work. Together with the Indonesian people, they have cleared the way and developed Indonesia's rich fields and mines, and have enlivened local commodity circulation and promoted the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The Overseas Chinese economy, along with the development of the Indonesian national economy, has become an inseparable component of it. The vast number of Overseas Chinese have not only integrated with the Indonesian people in social and economic life, but have also fought side by side with the Indonesian people in the struggle for national independence in Indonesia, jointly resisting the aggression of Dutch and Japanese imperialism. In the struggle against Japanese imperialism, hundreds and thousands of Overseas Chinese sacrificed their precious lives. Zhou Bin, Zhen Shuxi, Huo Jingya, Chen Jihai, Wu Huaxu, Li Jinyong of Sumatra, and Shen Wangjin and many other martyrs of Java, all shed their last drop of blood on Indonesian soil in the anti-Japanese struggle. In 1945, in the struggle of the Indonesian people against Dutch colonial rule, many Overseas Chinese broke through the Dutch army's blockade to transport military supplies to the Indonesian army, and some even directly participated in the Indonesian people's armed forces, or organized "wartime service groups" to enter and exit war zones to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. After China and Indonesia successively achieved independence, especially after the Bandung Conference, the friendship between our two countries has further developed, and the relationship between Overseas Chinese and the local people has become even closer. Under the guidance of the Chinese government, the vast number of Overseas Chinese not only abide by the laws and decrees of the Indonesian government and do not participate in local political activities, but also more actively participate in economic and cultural undertakings that are beneficial to the Indonesian people. In particular, in the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialist interference and suppression of rebellious groups, our government and people, as well as the vast number of Overseas Chinese, have resolutely stood on the side of the Indonesian people and provided as much support as possible. These historical facts fully demonstrate that Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people have forged a bond of shared hardship and struggle in their long-term common life and common struggle. But it is heartbreaking that some malicious forces in Indonesia are now repaying kindness with ingratitude, openly slandering Overseas Chinese as "fifth columnists" and "the Overseas Chinese economy as the remnants of colonialism," treating Overseas Chinese as nationals of hostile countries, and persecuting them in an inhumane manner. This is a completely ungrateful act of treating friends as enemies, making those who are close to them suffer and those who hate them rejoice.

In accordance with the Bandung Principles, the issue of Overseas Chinese is not difficult to resolve through friendly consultation; those malicious forces that provoke anti-Chinese movements attempt to undermine the friendship between the two countries and divert the goals of the Indonesian people's national and democratic struggle.

As everyone knows, the issue of Overseas Chinese is a problem left over from a long historical development. For certain less reasonable phenomena, as long as both sides adhere to the principles of the Bandung Conference and resolve them through friendly consultation, it should not be difficult to eliminate them. In fact, as early as 1955, our government signed a relevant treaty with the Indonesian government on resolving the issue of dual nationality of Overseas Chinese, and then the prime ministers of the two countries exchanged notes. As for the issue of how to guide Overseas Chinese capital to invest more in industry, our government has long educated Overseas Chinese and suggested that the Indonesian government take appropriate steps to absorb Overseas Chinese capital and develop its own national industry. The joint communique of the two foreign ministers in October of this year even more clearly proposed that in handling the economic status of Overseas Chinese, it is necessary to benefit the development of the Indonesian economy and to respect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese. On August 17 of this year, President Sukarno also stated in his political declaration that non-national forces and funds will be given appropriate status and opportunities in Indonesia's activities to increase industrial and agricultural production. However, regrettably, the dual nationality treaty has not been implemented for a long time, and the principles put forward in the joint communique of the two foreign ministers and President Sukarno's political declaration have not been observed. Instead, activities of rudely attacking Overseas Chinese have emerged in Indonesia, and certain malicious forces in Indonesia have taken the opportunity to provoke a large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-China adverse current. Here, we cannot help but ask: If it is truly for the purpose of developing the Indonesian national economy, then why not dare to touch the monopolistic capital of imperialism, but concentrate efforts on attacking Overseas Chinese small vendors? If there is truly sincerity in resolving the issue of Overseas Chinese, then why abandon the agreement already reached between our two governments and take tyrannical measures against Overseas Chinese? It is not difficult to see that those malicious forces are not truly seeking to develop the national economy and have no sincerity in resolving the issue of Overseas Chinese. They are merely using this as an excuse to deliberately undermine the friendship between China and Indonesia, incite national chauvinistic sentiments, and attempt to divert the goals of the Indonesian people's national and democratic struggle, attack the patriotic and democratic forces in Indonesia, and allow the aggressive forces of US imperialism and Japanese militarism to take advantage of the situation. If this conspiracy is allowed to succeed, then what will be harmed is not only the friendship between Overseas Chinese and China and Indonesia, but first and foremost the cause of Indonesian national independence.

In the era of old China, Overseas Chinese had grievances that could not be redressed and a nation to which they could not return in times of crisis. Now, the great motherland is becoming stronger and more prosperous day by day and is a strong backing for Overseas Chinese. Our government and people cannot sit idly by and watch Overseas Chinese being arbitrarily persecuted by others.

The founding of New China has brought about a fundamental change in the status of Overseas Chinese. Our government and people have always held infinite concern for Overseas Chinese and do everything possible to protect their legitimate rights and interests. This is something that we, the returned Overseas Chinese who have resided abroad for a long time, feel particularly deeply. Recalling the past era of old China, due to internal and external troubles and economic bankruptcy, many Overseas Chinese were forced by livelihood to leave their hometowns and wander overseas, suffering discrimination, persecution, and exploitation by imperialism and the reactionary forces of the country of residence. They truly had grievances that could not be redressed and a nation to which they could not return in times of crisis, falling into a miserable situation of being dependent on others and having no one to rely on. However, this situation will never return. Our great motherland is becoming stronger and more prosperous day by day. Our government and people cannot sit idly by and watch Overseas Chinese being arbitrarily persecuted and humiliated by others. If the country of residence cannot tolerate them and their livelihood is in difficulty, they can return to the embrace of the motherland at any time and participate in the construction of the motherland. In the past ten years, more than 300,000 Overseas Chinese have returned to China one after another, and have been properly arranged and cared for by the motherland in their lives and work. This shows that our great motherland is the most powerful backing for Overseas Chinese. Our government and people are particularly concerned about the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia who are being subjected to inhumane treatment. Foreign Minister Chen Yi, on behalf of our government, has formally proposed that for those Overseas Chinese who are displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia, the Chinese government is prepared to arrange for them to live in the country according to their wishes to return to China, so that they have the opportunity to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. We wholeheartedly support this measure of our government and warmly welcome all Overseas Chinese who wish to return to the country to return to the embrace of the motherland. However, this reasonable proposal of our government must not be used as an excuse to further exclude and persecute Overseas Chinese. The four principles for arranging the return of Overseas Chinese put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi in his letter are reasonable and in full compliance with international practice. Our government has always sent foreign nationals who wish to return to their countries in accordance with these principles. Take Japanese nationals for example. Although our country has not yet concluded a treaty of peace or established diplomatic relations with Japan, our government still abided by these principles when sending them back to their country. Therefore, we hope that the Indonesian government can accept the Chinese government's proposal so that the work of Overseas Chinese returning to China can proceed smoothly.

Comrades, representatives: The situation in our country is infinitely beautiful, and we are building our socialist motherland at a flying speed. All our construction undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds, making our motherland's face change with each passing day and becoming increasingly prosperous. Since last year, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the people of the whole country have carried out an unprecedented great leap forward in socialist construction and have universally established people's communes. At present, the people of the whole country are responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning,鼓干劲 (gu gan jin, meaning to boost morale), and launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy, ushering in a magnificent new high tide of production and construction. Our people's communes, after rectification, have been greatly consolidated, have embarked on the road of sound development, and are increasingly showing their superiority. This is the most important guarantee that we were able to overcome the extraordinary natural disasters this year and achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture. Thanks to the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, the various production targets of our country in 1959 will certainly be overfulfilled, and the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule is within sight. The people of our country will hold even higher the red banner of the General Line and bravely fight along the victorious road of the Great Leap Forward opened up in 1958 for the continued leap forward in the future, for catching up with the level of the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products within ten years, for rapidly building our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture.

The situation in the motherland is infinitely beautiful, and all construction undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds. Returned Overseas Chinese have made great contributions on all fronts. All returned Overseas Chinese have the opportunity to make contributions to the motherland.

We are pleased to see that the vast number of returned Overseas Chinese have played their initiative in the socialist construction of the motherland and have made great contributions, and many pacesetters and red banner bearers have emerged on all fronts. For example, among the 17 returned Overseas Chinese at the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, 16 are labor models or advanced workers. Lin Deshi, a returned Overseas Chinese grinder at the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, has produced no defective products for more than five years and has been rated as a pacesetter in the Tianjin industrial system. At the National Congress of Heroes held in Beijing in October this year, 11 representatives of returned Overseas Chinese participated. The 50,000 Overseas Chinese students who have returned to China are closely united with domestic students and are studying hard. Many of them have become outstanding students who support socialism, love labor, care for the collective, and have excellent grades. For example, among the 500 returned Overseas Chinese students in Hangzhou, 105 were rated as "three-good students" (good in thinking, good in learning, and good in labor) in the first semester of this year; more than 100 joined the Communist Youth League. Many returned Overseas Chinese students who have graduated and taken up jobs have also given play to their expertise in various work posts and have become a force in the socialist construction of the motherland. Among the representatives attending the meeting today, there are advanced and model figures in various fields, including Wang Yinxiang, a militia model and flood control hero from the Fujian coastal defense line, Wu Huaqing, deputy captain of the production team of Jinghong Farm in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, Huang Chunhai, an excellent salesperson from Sanmenxia, a returned Overseas Chinese from Thailand, and Wang Qichang, a medical worker from the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, and Chen Ruitu, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia who dared to advance towards cutting-edge technology and successfully trial-produced "semiconductor automatic control lamps" and "electrostatic spinning automatic control." All of the above vividly proves that the motherland is everywhere a fertile ground for cultivating heroes. All Overseas Chinese who return to the motherland, under the care of the government, can find suitable jobs, give play to their talents, and have the opportunity to establish glorious merits for their motherland and future generations.

The socialist construction of the motherland is flourishing. We do not feel that the population is too large, but that there are not enough hands. We not only welcome the Overseas Chinese displaced in Indonesia to return to China, but also welcome all Overseas Chinese who have difficulty making a living abroad to return to China. The Overseas Chinese Federation will assist the government in properly resettling them so that they can participate in the construction of the motherland with a happy mood.

The vigorous development of our country's socialist construction has fundamentally solved the employment problem of the people of the whole country. Now we do not feel that the population is too large, but that there is a general shortage of manpower. Our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, and development is needed everywhere. New undertakings are being created every day. Even after we have achieved a high degree of industrialization and agricultural mechanization, we will never worry about having too many people, but only worry about having too few people. The socialist construction of the motherland needs more and more Overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in production. This fact completely shatters the shameless slanders spread by imperialism and foreign reactionaries that China will use its "excessive" population to "expand" outwards and use Overseas Chinese to carry out subversive activities. Now, we not only welcome all those Overseas Chinese who are displaced in Indonesia, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue residing there to return, but also welcome all Overseas Chinese who encounter difficulties abroad or who are willing to return to China for other reasons. The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese will assist the government in properly arranging their lives and work according to the needs of the work and their wishes, so that they can join the people of the country in a happy mood to jointly build our great socialist motherland.

Comrades, representatives, the main task of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese is: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, in cooperation with relevant departments, to do a good job in domestic Overseas Chinese affairs, so as to unite all returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and returned Overseas Chinese students, give full play to their initiative, and serve our country's socialist construction; at the same time, we must maintain close ties with Overseas Chinese abroad, strengthen the patriotic unity of Overseas Chinese abroad, and enhance the friendship between Overseas Chinese and the people of the countries where they reside. Our past work has achieved great success. This meeting of ours is to discuss how to better strengthen our work in all aspects in the new year and make more contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland. I believe that our meeting will definitely be successful. Our work will definitely achieve greater success.

Long live the great socialist motherland!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people! (The subheadings in the text are added by the editor of this newspaper.) (Attached picture)

    欢迎侨居印度尼西亚的亲人返回祖国
    全体归国侨胞热烈拥护并坚决支持陈毅外长提出的三项建议
    希望印度尼西亚当局立即派遣代表同我国协商解决华侨问题
    据新华社上海16日电　中华全国归国华侨联合会第一届第四次全体委员会扩大会议今天在上海开幕。
    出席这次会议的有全国侨联主席陈嘉庚，副主席方方、尤扬祖、王源兴、庄希泉、庄明理、陈其瑗、黄长水、蚁美厚等，以及全国侨联委员和全国各地归国华侨、华侨眷属中的先进模范人物共四百三十六人。
    港澳工商界代表十三人列席了这次会议。
    陈嘉庚在会上致开幕词。
    新华社上海16日电　中华全国归国华侨联合会主席陈嘉庚在全国侨联第一届第四次全体委员会扩大会议上的开幕词，全文如下：
    中华全国归国华侨联合会第一届第四次全体委员会扩大会议开幕了。今天出席我们会议的还有上海市党和政府有关部门的负责同志。他们莅临指导，给我们很大的鼓舞，我谨代表全体委员和出席会议的代表，向他们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。
    在我们会议开幕的前几天，我们看到了陈毅外长就全面解决在印度尼西亚的华侨问题给印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约的信。这封信充分表明我国政府对于维护中国和印度尼西亚两国友谊的诚意和保护华侨正当权益的一贯立场。信中严正地谴责和抗议在印度尼西亚出现的反华排华活动，并且就全面解决华侨问题提出了三项合情合理的建议，希望印度尼西亚政府立即指派代表同我国政府的代表协商解决华侨问题。在陈毅外长的这封信里，除了建议两国政府尽速解决华侨的双重国籍问题，要求印度尼西亚政府切实保护华侨的正当权益以外，特别提到对于那些流离失所或不愿继续在印度尼西亚居留的华侨，我国政府准备按照他们的志愿，安排他们回国参加建设，并且希望印度尼西亚政府依据公平合理的原则，分期分批地遣送他们回国。这不仅表达了全国六亿五千万人民对海外华侨的无限关切，而且也充分反映了广大海外华侨的愿望和呼声。我们全体归国华侨对于陈毅外长代表我国政府所提出的这些建议，表示热烈的拥护和坚决的支持。
    对于最近印度尼西亚出现的反华排华运动，全
  国归国华侨表示严重抗议；对于印度尼西亚人民
  给予华侨的同情和支持表示感谢。
    今年5月以来，在印度尼西亚就出现了一股反华排华的逆流，这股逆流在陈毅外长和苏班德里约外长关于维护和发展两国友好关系、合理解决华侨问题的联合公报发表以后，不仅没有收敛，反而变本加厉。某些敌视中国和印度尼西亚友谊的势力，利用禁止外国小零售商在一级和二级自治区和州的首府以外地区经商的法令，集中力量打击华侨，强迫他们迁出原来居住的地区，使华侨的正当权益受到严重的损害，人身安全受到严重的侵犯。大批的华侨颠沛流离，生活无着。特别令人愤慨的是，在逼迁的过程中，竟出动军警，鸣枪射击，强拉孕妇和病人上车，殴打和污辱华侨，并且不许被打伤的人送医院治疗，造成了严重的流血事件。最近以来，更肆意拘捕华侨，加以惨无人道的虐待。当地华侨为了维护自己的生存，曾经一再向当地政府呼吁，要求保护，停止迫害，但是毫无效果。为了维护华侨的正当权益，我国政府曾经一再提请印度尼西亚政府注意，我国驻印度尼西亚的使领馆也一再向印度尼西亚政府提出交涉和抗议。但是，印度尼西亚当局竟置若罔闻，反而违背国际惯例，无理地限制我使领馆人员的合法活动。不仅如此，印度尼西亚的某些报刊为了煽动反华情绪，配合排华活动，还大量散布诬蔑和诋毁我国的言论，甚至公然侮辱我国人民敬爱的领袖，严重地伤害了中国人民的感情。印度尼西亚所出现的这种严重损害两国友谊的反华排华活动，不仅使中国人民难以容忍，而且也引起了印度尼西亚公正人士和广大人民的不安和不满。今天已经得到祖国温暖照顾的归国华侨，对于目前在印度尼西亚遭受迫害的侨胞特别寄予同情。我代表全体归国华侨向他们表示亲切的慰问，并且对他们所受到的种种迫害提出严重的抗议。我还要代表全体归国华侨，对于印度尼西亚人民给予华侨的同情和支持，表示衷心的谢意。
    历史说明，华侨和印度尼西亚人民在共同生活
  和共同斗争中结成了患难之交，目前的反华运动
  完全是一种忘恩负义、以友为敌的行为。
    我国侨民旅居印度尼西亚已经有一千五百多年的历史。在这悠久的岁月中，华侨和印度尼西亚人民亲密相处，以他们辛勤的劳动对印度尼西亚的经济和文化的发展作出了不能磨灭的贡献。他们同印度尼西亚人民一起，披荆斩棘，开发了印度尼西亚富饶的田园和矿山，并且活跃了当地的商品流通，促进了城乡间的物资交流。华侨经济随同印度尼西亚民族经济的发展，而成为它的一个不可分割的组成部分。广大华侨不仅在社会经济生活中，同印度尼西亚人民融合在一起，而且在印度尼西亚争取民族独立的斗争中，始终和印度尼西亚人民并肩作战，共同抵抗了荷兰和日本帝国主义的侵略。在反抗日本帝国主义的斗争中，成百成千的华侨献出了自己宝贵的生命。苏门答腊的周斌、甄树熙、霍警亚、陈吉海、伍华鋈、李金涌，以及爪哇的沈望金等许多烈士，都是在抗日斗争中，在印度尼西亚的土地上洒下了他们最后的一滴鲜血。1945年，在印度尼西亚人民反抗荷兰殖民统治的斗争中，许多华侨冲破荷军封锁线，为印度尼西亚军队输送军火物资，有些还直接参加了印度尼西亚人民的武装部队，或者组织“战时服务团”，出入战区救扶伤兵和难民。在中国和印度尼西亚相继取得独立以后，特别是在万隆会议以后，我们两国的友谊有了进一步的发展，华侨和当地人民的关系也更加亲密。在中国政府的教导下，广大华侨不仅遵守印度尼西亚政府的法令，不参加当地的政治活动，而且更加积极地参加了有利于印度尼西亚人民的经济和文化事业。特别是在印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义干涉和镇压叛乱集团的斗争中，我国政府和人民以及广大华侨都坚决站在印度尼西亚人民一边，尽量给予支持。这些历史事实，充分说明了华侨和印度尼西亚人民在长期的共同生活和共同斗争中，已经结成了患难之交。但是令人痛心的是，现在印度尼西亚的一些别有用心的势力却以怨报德，公然诬蔑华侨是“第五纵队”，“华侨经济是殖民主义经济残余”，把华侨当作敌对国家的侨民看待，对他们进行惨无人道的迫害，这完全是一种忘恩负义、以友为敌、使亲者痛仇者快的行为。
    本着万隆原则，通过友好协商，华侨问题不难
  解决；那些别有用心的挑起排华运动的势力企图
  破坏两国友谊，转移印度尼西亚人民民族民主斗
    争目标。
    谁都知道，华侨问题是一个长期历史发展遗留下来的问题。对于某些不够合理的现象，只要双方本着万隆会议的原则，通过友好协商的途径，本来是不难消除的。事实上，我国政府早在1955年，就同印度尼西亚政府就解决华侨的双重国籍问题签订了有关的条约，接着并由两国总理进行了换文。至于如何引导华侨资本更多地投向工业方面的问题，我国政府也早就对华侨进行过教育，并且建议印度尼西亚政府采取适当的步骤，吸收华侨资本，发展自己的民族工业。今年10月，两国外长的联合公报，更明确地提出了在处理华侨的经济地位问题时，既要有利于印度尼西亚经济的发展，又要使华侨的正当权利和利益得到尊重的原则。今年8月17日苏加诺总统在他的政治宣言中，也表示非本国的力量和资金在印度尼西亚增加工农业生产的活动中，都将得到适当的地位和机会。但是，遗憾的是，双重国籍条约迟迟未能付诸实施，两国外长联合公报和苏加诺总统政治宣言中所提出的原则也没有得到遵守，而在印度尼西亚却出现了粗暴的打击华侨的活动，印度尼西亚某些别有用心的势力更乘机挑起了大规模排华反华的逆流。这里我们不禁要问：如果真正是为了要发展印度尼西亚的民族经济，那么为什么对帝国主义垄断资本不敢触动，却集中力量打击华侨小商贩呢？如果是真正有诚意解决华侨问题，又为什么撇开我们两国政府早就取得的协议，而对华侨采取横暴的措施呢？这就不难看出，那些别有用心的势力并不是真正要发展民族经济和有诚意解决华侨问题。他们不过是以此为借口，故意破坏中国和印度尼西亚的友谊，煽动民族沙文主义情绪，企图转移印度尼西亚人民民族、民主斗争的目标，打击印度尼西亚的爱国民主力量，使美帝国主义和日本军国主义的侵略势力乘虚而入。如果让这种阴谋得逞，那么受到损害的不仅是华侨和中国与印度尼西亚两国的友谊，而且首先是印度尼西亚的民族独立事业。
    旧中国时代，华侨有苦难诉，有国难归；现在伟大的祖国一天比一天强大和繁荣，是侨胞有力的靠山，我国政府和人民决不能坐视海外侨胞被人家任意迫害。
    新中国的成立，使海外华侨的地位发生了根本的变化。我国政府和人民对海外侨胞，一向抱着无限的关怀，尽一切可能保护他们正当的权利和利益。这一点对于我们曾经长期在国外居留过的归侨来说，是感受的特别深刻的。回想过去旧中国的时代，由于内忧外患，经济破产，很多华侨为生计所迫，不得不离乡背井，漂泊海外，受尽了帝国主义和侨居国反动势力的歧视、迫害和压榨，真是有苦难诉，有国难归，陷于寄人篱下，无依无靠的悲惨境地。但是，这种情况现在一去不复返了。我们伟大的祖国正在变得一天比一天强大，一天比一天繁荣。我国政府和人民决不能坐视海外侨胞被人家任意迫害和凌辱。如果侨居国对他们不能相容，他们的生活出路发生了困难，他们就可以随时回到祖国的怀抱，参加祖国的建设。十年来已经先后有三十多万侨胞回国，并且在生活和工作中得到祖国妥善的安排和照顾。这说明我们伟大的祖国是海外侨胞最有力的靠山。我国政府和人民对于在印度尼西亚遭到非人道待遇的侨胞，感到特别的关切。陈毅外长代表我国政府已经正式提出，对于那些流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚的华侨，中国政府准备根据他们回国的志愿，安排他们在国内生活，使他们有机会参加祖国的社会主义建设。我们衷心地拥护我国政府的这一措施，热烈地欢迎一切要求回国的侨胞重返祖国的怀抱。但是，我国政府的这一合理的建议，决不允许被利用为进一步排斥和迫害华侨的借口。陈毅外长在他的信中所提出的安排华侨回国的四条原则，是合情合理的，也是完全符合国际惯例的。我国政府历来就是按照这些原则遣送愿意回国的外侨。就拿日本侨民来说，尽管我国同日本至今还没有订立和约、建立邦交，但是我国政府在遣送他们回国时，仍然遵守了这些原则。因此，我们希望，印度尼西亚政府能够接受中国政府的建议，使华侨回国的工作顺利的进行。
    同志们，代表们：我们国内的形势无限美好，我们正在以飞跃的速度，建设着我们社会主义的祖国。我们的一切建设事业，突飞猛进，一日千里，使我们祖国的面貌日新月异，欣欣向荣。自去年以来，全国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，实行了史无前例的社会主义建设大跃进，并且普遍地建立起人民公社。目前，全国人民正在响应党的八届八中全会所发出的反右倾、鼓干劲、开展群众性的增产节约运动的伟大号召，掀起了一个波澜壮阔的新的生产建设高潮。我们的人民公社经过整顿已经大大地巩固起来，走上了健全发展的道路，并且愈来愈显示出它的优越性，这是我们今年能够战胜特大的自然灾害，取得农业丰产的最重要的保证。由于全国人民的共同努力，1959年我国的各项生产指标，肯定能够超额完成，第二个五年计划提前三年完成，眼看就可变成事实。我国人民将更高地举起总路线的红旗，沿着1958年所开辟的大跃进的胜利道路，为今后的继续跃进，为在十年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平，为迅速地把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家而英勇奋斗。
    祖国形势无限美好，一切建设事业突飞猛进，归国华侨在各个战线上作出了很大贡献；所有归侨都有机会为祖国建立功勋。
    我们高兴地看到，广大的归国华侨在祖国的社会主义建设事业中发挥了他们的积极性，作出了很大的贡献，并且在各条战线上涌现了许多标兵和红旗手。例如，长春第一汽车制造厂十七位归国华侨中就有十六位是劳动模范或先进工作者。天津市第一机械厂归国华侨磨工林德时五年多不出废品，被评为天津市工业系统的标兵。在今年10月北京召开的全国群英会上，就有归国华侨代表十一人参加。已经归国的五万名华侨学生和国内同学亲密团结，努力学习。他们当中不少人成为拥护社会主义、热爱劳动、关心集体、成绩优良的优秀学生。例如杭州市五百名归国华侨学生中，就有一百零五人在今年上学期被评为“思想好、学习好、劳动好”的三好学生；有一百余人参加了共青团。许多毕业后走上工作岗位的归国华侨学生，在各个工作岗位上，也发挥了他们的专长，成为祖国社会主义建设中的一支力量。今天出席会议的代表中，就有各方面的先进和模范人物，有来自福建海防线上的民兵模范、防汛功臣侨眷王银祥，有云南西双版纳景洪农场生产队副队长、印度尼西亚归侨吴华清，有三门峡的优秀售货员、泰国归侨黄春海，有来自新疆天山北麓的医务工作者王其昌，有敢于向尖端技术进军先后试制成功“半导体自动控制电灯”、“静电纺纱自动控制”的印度尼西亚归侨陈瑞图。上述这一切生动地证明，祖国到处都是培植英雄的土壤，凡是回到祖国的华侨，在政府的关怀下，都能找到他们合适的工作岗位，都能发挥他们的才能，都有机会为自己的祖国和后代子孙建立光荣的功勋。
    祖国建设事业蓬勃发展，我们不是感到人口过多，而是人手不足；我们不仅欢迎在印度尼西亚流离失所的侨胞回国，而且欢迎一切在国外谋生困难的侨胞回国，侨联将协助政府妥善安置，使之心情舒畅参加祖国建设工作。
    我国社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，使我国从根本上解决了全国人民的就业问题，现在我们不是感到人口过多，而是普遍感到人手不足了。我国幅员辽阔，资源丰富，到处都需要开发，每天都有新的事业在创立，即使在实现了高度工业化和农业机械化以后，我们也永远不愁人多，只愁人少。祖国的社会主义建设事业，需要越来越多的海外侨胞回国参加生产。这个事实就彻底粉碎了帝国主义和外国反动派所散布的所谓中国将利用“过多”的人口向外“扩张”和利用华侨进行颠覆活动的无耻谰言。现在，我们不仅欢迎那些在印度尼西亚流离失所无法谋生或者不愿意继续居留下去的侨胞全部回来，而且也欢迎一切在国外遇到困难或者由于其它原因而愿意归国的侨胞全部回来。全国侨联将协助政府，根据工作的需要和他们的志愿，妥善地安排他们的生活和工作，使他们能够心情舒畅地和国内人民一道共同建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国。
    同志们，代表们，全国侨联的主要任务就是：在中国共产党和政府的领导下，配合有关部门，做好国内的侨务工作，以便团结全体归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生，充分发挥他们的积极性，为我国的社会主义建设事业服务；同时要密切同国外华侨的联系，加强国外华侨的爱国大团结，增进华侨同侨居国人民的友谊。我们过去的工作已经取得了很大的成绩。我们这次的会议就是要讨论在新的一年中，如何更好地加强我们各方面的工作，为祖国的社会主义建设，作出更多的贡献。我相信，我们的这次会议一定能够成功。我们的工作一定能取得更大的成绩。
    伟大的社会主义祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！（文内插题为本报编者所加）（附图片）
