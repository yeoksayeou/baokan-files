Xinhua News Agency, December 8th -- The Higher People's Courts of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, based on the "Amnesty Order of the President of the People's Republic of China" issued on September 17th, have, from late September until now, granted amnesty to the first group of counter-revolutionary criminals and ordinary criminal offenders who have genuinely reformed. The work of granting amnesty to criminals in various regions is still ongoing.

The first group of amnestied counter-revolutionary and criminal offenders totaled 12,082 people, including 2,424 counter-revolutionary criminals and 9,269 ordinary criminal offenders; 389 criminals sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, commuted to life imprisonment or imprisonment of fifteen years or more, and those sentenced to life imprisonment, commuted to imprisonment of ten years or more.

When implementing the amnesty, the Higher People's Courts in various regions conducted a comprehensive review of the criminals to be amnestied. When announcing the list of amnestied criminals, amnesty release conferences were held with the participation of all criminals, and amnesty notices were issued to the amnestied criminals at the meetings. Relevant authorities in various regions arranged living arrangements for the released prisoners based on their wishes and skills. Relevant departments also provided travel expenses for released criminals returning to their hometowns to participate in production.

For the past ten years, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have resolutely implemented the Party and the People's Government's policy of combining punishment with leniency, and combining labor reform with ideological education, towards counter-revolutionaries and other criminals. On the one hand, they forced criminals to participate in labor production, and on the other hand, they conducted political and ideological education to make them thoroughly recognize their crimes, correct their reactionary views and positions, establish labor viewpoints, and develop labor habits, so that they could become new people who support themselves. Due to the correctness and greatness of the Party and government's policies, many criminals were inspired, gradually recognized their crimes, and showed signs of admitting their guilt, obeying the law, and reforming, and a group of them have indeed reformed.

In Hunan Province, a counter-revolutionary criminal named Liu Junde, who once served as the leader of a Central Statistics Bureau (CC Bureau) special agent group, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve in 1951. During labor reform, he exposed more than 100 special agents and reactionary party and league backbone elements hidden in society, and he has also been actively engaged in labor production and studying production techniques. He has been treated leniently by the government several times and has now been granted amnesty. In Jilin Province, a counter-revolutionary criminal named Zhang Zhiliang, who used to participate in the Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau's special agent organization, repeatedly collected military intelligence for our army. He was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment in 1951. During labor reform, he realized the seriousness of his crimes, not only fully confessed all his crimes, but also successively exposed more than 20 counter-revolutionary elements and other criminals hidden in society, and took the lead in labor, often overfulfilling production tasks. He has now been granted amnesty and released.

Many criminal offenders who were once the dregs of society have also been reformed and released by the government through amnesty. In Guangdong Province, a bandit named Pan Huinan, who was originally sentenced to ten years in prison, gradually moved closer to the government and the people and developed labor habits through ideological education during labor reform. In May 1956, when the flood control dam foundation in a mining area was washed away by mountain floods, he actively went into the water to carry out emergency repairs, using his body to block the gap at a critical moment, maintaining the safety of the dam foundation. At the same time, he dared to fight against the criminal behavior of other criminals and was granted amnesty and released this time. Chen Ping, a thief from Shaanxi Province, gradually recognized his crimes during labor reform. When he worked in a brick factory, he was able to work hard to study technology and take the lead in labor. This year, he successfully tested the use of mixed coal for firing kilns, ensuring product quality, shortening the kiln firing time, and saving a large amount of good coal. This time he was granted amnesty. Song Zhaoping, a habitual thief from Henan Province who was granted amnesty, was lazy and addicted to stealing in the old society. During his sentence, he learned techniques such as making adobe bricks and loading kilns. Because he was active in labor, he received many awards. Once, when he was buying something, the salesperson gave him 27 yuan more. When he discovered this, he immediately returned it. Chen Ming, a habitual thief from Guangdong Province, was originally sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. During his reform, he gradually developed labor habits, picked up lost money several times, and reported all the theft cases he knew. This time he was also granted amnesty and released.

The criminals were very grateful for the state's decision to grant amnesty. When the amnesty order was transmitted to the prison, many prisoners shouted, "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Some prisoners were moved to tears. Many prisoners in custody re-confessed their crimes, expressing their desire to get closer to the government and strive for lenient treatment. Many amnestied criminals expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao at the amnesty release conference, and pledged to accept the supervision of the masses in the future, work hard, and continue to strive to reform themselves. Gao Fuyou, a trafficker from Jilin Province who was granted amnesty and released, said excitedly: The Party and the government have transformed me, a lazy and ubiquitous trafficker, into a fifth-grade fitter with a high school education. This is a great victory for the Party and the government's labor reform policy. He said that he will work harder in the future to do more good deeds for the country and the people and contribute his strength. Wang Baocheng, a thief from Henan Province who was granted amnesty, was arrested in the first half of 1958, leaving his mother and three young siblings at home. During his sentence, he was always worried about the livelihood of his family. After communization last year, the whole family's life was guaranteed, and his two younger brothers and sisters were provided by the commune to go to school. Wang Baocheng said at the amnesty conference: "The Communist Party has transformed me from a bad person into a good person, and the people's commune has made our family live a happy life. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are my re-born parents and our family's saviors. After returning home on amnesty, I will work hard to participate in labor production to repay the kindness of the Party and the government." Many released criminals also read out plans for continuing to thoroughly reform themselves at the conference. Criminals who were not granted amnesty also expressed at the conference that they would listen to the government better in the future, honestly intensify their reform, and strive for lenient treatment from the government as soon as possible. Some family members of amnestied criminals attended the amnesty release conference. They also expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao at the meeting, and said that they must help their released relatives to continue to reform. Bian Hongying, a family member of a released criminal from Shandong Province, said: "I am really grateful to the Party and the government for their brilliant policies on criminals. My brother used to be a bad person with extremely bad character, but now he has been reformed by the government. This is something that I wouldn't even dare to think about in the old society. I must help him well in the future so that he can continue to reform."

    全国各省、市、自治区高级人民法院
    特赦首批改恶从善罪犯一万多名
    各地根据被特赦罪犯的愿望和技能条件，为他们安排了生活出路
    获得释放的罪犯回乡参加生产时，有关部门还给他们发放了路费
    新华社8日讯　全国各省、市、自治区的高级人民法院，根据9月17日发布的“中华人民共和国主席特赦令”，从9月下旬开始到目前为止，已经特赦了首批确实改恶从善的反革命罪犯和普通刑事罪犯。目前各地特赦罪犯的工作还在继续进行。
    第一批特赦的反革命罪犯和刑事罪犯共一万二千零八十二名，其中特赦释放反革命罪犯二千四百二十四名，普通刑事罪犯九千二百六十九名；判处死刑缓期二年执行减为无期徒刑或十五年以上有期徒刑的罪犯，以及叛处无期徒刑减为十年以上有期徒刑的罪犯共三百八十九名。
    各地高级人民法院在实行特赦的时候，对于被特赦的罪犯都进行了全面的审查。在宣布特赦罪犯的名单时，都召开了有全体罪犯参加的特赦释放大会，并在会上把特赦通知书发给得到特赦的罪犯。得到特赦释放的犯人，各地有关机关都根据他们本人的愿望和技能条件，为他们安排了生活出路。获得释放的罪犯回乡参加生产时，有关部门还给他们发了路费。
    各省、市、自治区十年来坚决执行了党和人民政府对反革命分子和其他犯罪分子实行的惩办和宽大相结合、劳动改造和思想教育相结合的政策，一方面强迫犯罪分子参加劳动生产，一方面对他们进行政治思想教育，使他们彻底认识自己的罪恶，改正自己的反动观点和立场，树立劳动观点，养成劳动习惯，使他们成为自食其力的新人。由于党和政府政策的正确和伟大，不少罪犯受到感召，逐步认识了自己的罪恶，有了认罪服法、改恶从善的表现，有一批确实改恶从善了。
    湖南省一个曾担任中统特务组长的反革命罪犯刘峻德，1951年被判处死刑，缓期二年执行。他在劳动改造中检举了潜藏在社会上的特务分子和反动党、团骨干分子一百多名，并且一直积极劳动生产，钻研生产技术，连续几次受到政府的宽大处理，这次又得到特赦。吉林省有一个反革命罪犯叫张志良，过去参加国民党中统局特务组织，多次搜集我军事情报。1951年被判处徒刑十年，他在劳动改造中，认识到自己的严重罪恶，不仅补充交代了自己的全部罪行，还先后检举了二十余名隐藏在社会上的反革命分子和其他犯罪分子，并且在劳动中积极带头，经常超额完成生产任务，这次得到特赦释放。
    过去是社会渣滓的许多刑事罪犯，也都得到了改造，被政府特赦释放。广东省一个原被判刑十年的土匪潘辉南，他在劳动改造中经过思想教育，逐步靠拢政府和人民，养成了劳动习惯。1956年5月间，一个矿区的防洪坝基为山洪冲垮，他积极下水抢险，在危急关头以身体堵缺口，维护坝基的安全，同时他对于其他罪犯的犯罪行为也敢于进行斗争，这次获得特赦释放。陕西省盗窃犯陈平，在劳动改造期间逐渐认识到自己的罪恶，他在砖瓦厂劳动时能够刻苦钻研技术，积极带头劳动。今年试验用混合煤烧窑成功，保证了产品质量，缩短了烧窑时间，节约了大量的好煤，这次得到特赦。河南省一个获得特赦的惯偷犯宋照平，在旧社会好逸恶劳、偷窃成性。他在服刑期间学会了打砖坯、装窑等技术，因为劳动积极，曾得到多次奖励，有一次买东西时售货员多找给他二十七元钱，他发现后当即退还。广东省一个惯偷犯陈明原来被判八年有期徒刑，他在改造期间逐渐养成劳动习惯，曾几次拾金不昧，并将他所知道的盗窃案件全部检举了出来，这次也得到特赦释放。
    罪犯们对国家决定特赦非常感激。当特赦令传到监狱的时候，许多犯人高呼：“共产党万岁！”
  “毛主席万岁！”有的犯人感动得流下了眼泪。有许多在押的犯人都重新交代了自己的罪行，表示要靠拢政府，争取宽大处理。许多得到特赦的犯人在特赦释放大会上表示衷心感激共产党和毛主席，并且保证今后要接受群众的监督，好好劳动，继续努力改造自己。吉林省的一个得到特赦释放的拐骗犯高富有激动地说：党和政府把我这个游手好闲到处拐骗的坏人，改造成一个文化达到高小程度的五级钳工，这是党和政府劳动改造政策的伟大胜利。他表示今后要更加努力为国家和人民多做好事，贡献力量。河南省一个得到特赦的偷盗犯王保成，1958年上半年被逮捕后，家里留下母亲和三个年幼的弟妹。他在服刑期间，一直担心一家人的生活。去年公社化以后，全家人生活得到保证，他的两个弟弟和妹妹都由公社供给上了学。王保成在特赦大会上说：“共产党把我由坏人改造成好人，人民公社又使我们一家人过着幸福的生活，共产党、毛主席是我的再生父母，是我们一家的救命恩人，特赦回家后我要努力参加劳动生产来回答党和政府的恩情。”许多被释放的罪犯，还在大会上宣读了继续彻底改造自己的规划。没有得到特赦的罪犯也在大会上表示今后要更好地听政府的话，老老实实地加紧改造自己，争取早日得到政府的宽大处理。有些被特赦的罪犯家属参加了特赦释放大会，她们也在会上表示衷心感谢共产党和毛主席，并且表示一定要帮助被释放的亲人继续进行改造。山东省一个得到释放的犯人家属边洪英说：“我实在感谢党和政府对犯人的英明政策，我的哥哥过去是个品行极端恶劣的坏人，现在被政府改造好了，这是在旧社会连想也不敢想的事。我今后一定要好好帮助他，使他继续进行改造。”
