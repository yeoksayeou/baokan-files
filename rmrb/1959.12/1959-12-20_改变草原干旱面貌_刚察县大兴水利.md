    Changing the Arid Face of the Grassland
    Gangcha County Vigorously Develops Water Conservancy
    (Reported by this newspaper) Gangcha County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, is vigorously developing grassland water conservancy construction by actively repairing canals, digging springs, and sinking wells to irrigate grasslands, in order to gradually change the arid face of the grasslands and ensure the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. Since last autumn, the county has developed more than 1,970,000 mu of grassland water conservancy, accounting for more than 50% of the grassland area that needs irrigation.
    Gangcha County is located on the north bank of Qinghai Lake, 3,300 meters above sea level. The terrain is high and cold, with frequent winds and little rainfall, so it is often threatened by drought. It is extremely difficult for people and animals to obtain drinking water, and the vast grasslands often cannot be fully utilized due to lack of water, seriously affecting the development of animal husbandry production and the improvement of the living standards of the herdsmen. Before the communization, the vast number of herdsmen, although eager to change this situation, never realized it due to the obstruction and sabotage of the reactionary herdowners. In 1958, the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province victoriously completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, and at the same time realized communization. The vast number of herdsmen not only thoroughly destroyed the reactionary rule of the feudal herdowner class, but also exposed the lies spread by the reactionary herdowners that "canals cannot be repaired, springs cannot be dug, and digging springs and repairing canals will cause blindness and broken legs," and quickly set off a mass movement to build grassland water conservancy, fearing neither heaven nor earth, as long as water conservancy is realized, even the Dragon King's eyes must be dug out.” In less than three months, sixteen main canals were built, one hundred and twenty-eight springs were dug, and twenty wells were sunk, irrigating more than 1,360,000 mu of grassland, making many arid grasslands available. In areas irrigated by water, pasture grass generally grew from four or five inches high in previous years to more than one foot, which played a very important role in the development of livestock this year. Of the county's 500,700 livestock, 98% reached first-class fatness; and many high-yield sheep flocks emerged. At the same time, these water conservancy projects have also promoted the consolidation of settled grazing and the implementation of the policy of "animal husbandry as the main industry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations." This year, the Hargei Commune cultivated and planted 5,000 mu of highland barley for the first time, with an average yield of 350 jin per mu, of which 346 mu yielded more than 1,000 jin per mu. This not only changed the past single economic situation of simply engaging in animal husbandry production and realized grain self-sufficiency, but also established a forage base for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. The vast number of herdsmen are filled with joy in their hearts about the tremendous changes that have taken place on the grassland after the construction of water conservancy, and joyful songs have spread throughout the grassland: "The clear river flows to the grassland, the abundant pasture grows long and long, cattle and sheep are fat, horses are strong, and we will never forget the kindness of the Communist Party."
    In order to further change the arid face of the grassland and ensure the high-speed development of animal husbandry and agricultural production, since this autumn, Gangcha County has not only actively organized forces to carry out land reclamation, but also launched a large-scale upsurge in the construction of farmland and grassland water conservancy. A socialist competition was widely launched among communes, brigades, production teams, and commune members to compete in enthusiasm, speed, quality, cooperation, and inventions and creations. Medical, commercial, cultural, and educational departments have also organized mobile service teams and roving performance teams to directly serve and perform for the masses on construction sites, greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the masses, with each person digging an average of about nine cubic meters of earth per day. In addition to the farmland water conservancy, the county has built large and small canals with a total length of 121 li, and has completed the task of building grassland water conservancy this winter and next spring ahead of schedule, building 41 canals with a total length of 102 li, digging springs and sinking more than 30 wells, which can irrigate more than 610,000 mu of grassland.
    At present, under the leadership of the local Party committee, the vast number of cadres and herdsmen are still continuing to repair canals, dig springs, and sink wells, striving to enable more grasslands to be irrigated.

    改变草原干旱面貌
    刚察县大兴水利
    本报讯　青海省海北藏族自治州刚察县大兴草原水利建设，积极修渠、挖泉、打井，引水灌溉草原，以逐步改变草原的干旱面貌，保证畜牧业生产的高速度发展。从去年秋季以来，全县已经兴修草原水利一百九十七万多亩，占需要引水灌溉的草原面积的50％以上。
    刚察县在青海湖北岸，拔海三千三百米，地势高寒，常年多风，雨量稀少，因而经常受到干旱的威胁，人畜饮水极感困难，广大草原往往因为缺水不能充分利用，严重地影响了畜牧业生产的发展和牧民群众生活水平的提高。公社化以前，广大牧民虽然渴望改变这一状况，但在反动牧主的阻挠和破坏下，始终没有实现。1958年青海省牧业区胜利地完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，同时实现了公社化。广大牧民不仅彻底摧毁了封建牧主阶级的反动统治，而且揭穿了反动牧主散布的“渠修不得，泉挖不得，挖泉修渠就要瞎眼断腿”的谎言，迅速地掀起了一个“天不怕，地不怕，只要水利化，龙王眼睛也要挖”的群众性的兴修草原水利运动。在不到三个月的时间中，就修成了干渠十六条，挖泉一百二十八个，打井二十眼，灌溉草原一百三十六万多亩，使许多干旱的草原得到了利用。经过引水灌溉的地区，牧草普遍由往年的四、五寸高生长到一尺以上，对今年牲畜的发展起了很重要的作用。全县五十万零七千多头牲畜中，一类膘即达到98％；并且出现了许多绵羊高产群。同时，这些水利工程对巩固定居放牧，贯彻“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针也起了促进作用。哈尔盖公社今年第一次开荒播种的五千亩青稞，平均亩产三百五十斤，其中有三百四十六亩亩产千斤以上。不仅改变了过去单纯从事畜牧业生产的单一经济状况，实现了粮食自给，而且为畜牧业生产的高速度发展建立了饲草饲料基地。广大牧民对兴修水利以后草原上出现的巨大变化，心中都充满了喜悦，欢乐的歌声传遍了整个草原：“清清的河水流到了草原上，丰美的牧草长又长，牛羊肥，马儿壮，共产党的恩情永不忘。”
    为了进一步改变草原的干旱面貌，保证畜牧业和农业生产的高速度发展，今年秋天以来，刚察县在积极组织力量进行垦荒的同时，还掀起了一个声势浩大的兴修农田和草原水利的高潮。公社、大队、生产队和社员之间广泛展开了比干劲、比速度、比质量、比协作、比发明创造的社会主义竞赛。医疗、商业、文教等部门也都组织了流动服务小组和巡回演出队，直接到工地为群众服务和演出，大大地鼓舞了群众的劳动热情，每人每天挖土平均达到九方左右。全县除在农田水利方面已经兴修了全长一百二十一华里的大小渠道以外，并提前超额完成了今冬明春兴修草原水利的任务，共修成全长一百零二华里的渠道四十一条，挖泉、打井三十多眼，可以灌溉草原六十一万多亩。
    目前，全县广大干部和牧民群众在当地党委的领导下，仍在继续修渠、挖泉、打井，争取有更多的草原能够得到灌溉。
