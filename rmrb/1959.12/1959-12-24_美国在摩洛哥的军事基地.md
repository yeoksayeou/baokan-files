U.S. Military Bases in Morocco

　　Eisenhower boasted that the United States "doesn't want an acre of land from anyone." This statement cannot stand the test of facts. The United States established military bases in Morocco during World War II, but to this day, it continues to赖着(use a literal translation, like "hang on") and refuses to withdraw, disregarding the demands of the Moroccan government. The U.S. military established naval and air force bases in Port Lyautey, Morocco, in 1942. In 1950, based on a military agreement signed with the French colonialists, the United States seized privileges such as stationing troops and establishing bases in Morocco. In 1951, based on this agreement, the United States announced that the U.S. Air Force would use seven airports in Morocco, establish a Strategic Air Command headquarters, and build five air force bases. In 1958, the number of U.S. Air Force personnel, sailors, and Marines stationed in Morocco reached approximately 18,000.

　　The series of military bases seized by the United States in Morocco have become one of the most important groups of bases it controls overseas. These bases seriously undermine Morocco's territorial sovereignty and threaten Morocco's security and world peace.

　　Morocco gained independence in March 1956. On June 25 of the same year, the Moroccan Foreign Minister announced that he did not recognize the U.S.-French agreement. In December, the Moroccan government also demanded the abolition of extraterritorial rights and other privileges stipulated in the U.S.-French agreement and previous agreements. Direct negotiations between Morocco and the United States were held in May 1957. In the autumn of the same year, when Moroccan King Mohammed V and Prime Minister Bekkai visited Washington, the United States agreed to hold negotiations to conclude some kind of temporary treaty to resolve the issue of these bases illegally occupied by the United States on Moroccan territory. However, the United States refused to withdraw its troops from Morocco. This October, during Moroccan Prime Minister Ibrahim's visit to the United States, he held talks with the United States again, but no agreement was reached on the issue of canceling the U.S. bases in Morocco.

　　The United States military's arrogant attitude of赖着(use a literal translation, like "hanging on") in Morocco has aroused great anger among the Moroccan people. On June 28 of last year, after the United States unilaterally announced that it would turn the Nouasseur Air Base, located fifteen miles south of Casablanca, into an atomic bomber base, Moroccan public opinion unanimously condemned it, and the Moroccan government also protested to the U.S. government the next day. In the summer of the same year, Moroccan dockworkers refused three times to unload ships carrying ammunition to U.S. bases. Large-scale demonstrations against the U.S. occupation of military bases have been held in Safi and other cities.

　　美国在摩洛哥的军事基地
    艾森豪威尔吹嘘说，美国“不要别人一亩土地”。他的这句话是经不起事实的检验的。美国自第二次世界大战时起在摩洛哥建立了军事基地，但至今不顾摩洛哥政府的要求，继续赖着不肯撤除。美国军队是1942年在摩洛哥里俄蒂港建立海空军基地的。1950年，美国根据和法国殖民者签订的军事协定，攫取了在摩洛哥派驻军队、建立基地等特权。1951年，美国根据这个协定，宣布美国空军使用摩洛哥的七个机场，设立战略轰炸机队指挥部，并修建了五个空军基地。1958年，美国驻扎在摩洛哥的空军人员、水兵和海军陆战队，达一万八千人左右。
    美国在摩洛哥霸占的一系列军事基地，已成为它在海外控制的最重要的一批基地。这些基地严重地破坏了摩洛哥的领土主权，威胁摩洛哥的安全和世界和平。
    1956年3月摩洛哥获得了独立。同年6月25日，摩洛哥外交大臣宣布不承认美法协定，12月摩洛哥政府又提出废除美法协定及以前各种协定所规定的治外法权和其他特权的要求。1957年5月摩美举行直接谈判。同年秋天，摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世和首相贝拉弗里杰访问华盛顿时，美国同意举行订立某种临时条约的谈判，以解决这些在摩洛哥领土上被美国非法占据的基地问题。但美国拒绝从摩洛哥撤出军队。今年10月，摩洛哥首相易卜拉欣访美期间，又同美国进行了会谈，但仍未能就取消美国在摩洛哥基地问题达成协议。
    美军赖在摩洛哥不走的蛮横态度，激起了摩洛哥人民极大的愤怒。去年6月28日，美国片面宣布把位于卡萨布兰卡以南十五英里的努瓦塞空军基地变为原子轰炸机基地后，摩洛哥舆论一致加以谴责，摩洛哥政府第二天也向美政府提出抗议。同年夏天，摩洛哥码头工人三次拒绝为向美国基地运送军火的船只卸货。在萨非和其他城市，都曾举行过反对美国霸占军事基地的大规模示威游行。
