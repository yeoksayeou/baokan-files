Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 12th: The Lebanese "News Weekly" published a commentary today pointing out that "the situation in the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee's discussion of the Algerian issue last week proves that the imperialist countries headed by the United States are the deadly enemies of the Arabs and all peoples struggling for freedom and independence."

The commentary said that the United States and other imperialist countries' opposition to the proposals of Asian and African countries on the Algerian issue further proves that the United States and other imperialist countries have not changed their policies toward Arab countries, and will never change their policies unless these imperialist countries change their social systems.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 12th: The Iraqi "National News" published a commentary on the 12th pointing out that although U.S. President Eisenhower, who is visiting foreign countries, is portrayed by some as a "messenger of peace," the U.S. policy of serving the interests of big monopoly capital and the imperialist system will not change. The newspaper said that just as Eisenhower is visiting some Asian countries, and some newspapers are calling him a "messenger of peace," and Eisenhower is raising his hat at every airport to the people of various countries, expressing the United States' support for their freedom and independence, the United States is trying its best to promote its policy of hostility towards the Arab and national liberation movements around the world. The newspaper said that the U.S.' "recent stance on the Algerian issue is nothing more than helping and supporting the French imperialists in carrying out a barbaric war against the fighting Algerian people." The newspaper said, "The United States always adopts a blatantly hostile stance towards any people who demand freedom and independence. In modern history, the United States has never supported or sympathized with any liberation movement. In fact, the entire history of the United States, especially recent history, is full of conspiracies against the liberation of Arab countries and other liberated countries aimed at undermining their freedom and independence."

The newspaper finally said that facts prove that as long as U.S. policy serves the interests of big monopoly capital and the interests of the imperialist system—an imperialist system that will rule other countries at every opportunity—then U.S. policy will not change.

The newspaper said that Eisenhower can no longer deceive anyone, because people of all countries know the distance between U.S. rhetoric and actual actions.

    黎巴嫩“消息周报”评论指出
    美帝国主义是各国人民的死敌
    伊拉克“国家报”说美国侵略政策不会改变
    新华社贝鲁特12日电　黎巴嫩“消息周报”今天发表评论指出，“联合国大会政治委员会在上星期讨论阿尔及利亚问题的情况证明，以美国为首的帝国主义国家是阿拉伯人和正在为争取自由和独立而斗争的各国人民的死敌。”
    评论说，美国和其他帝国主义国家对亚非国家关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案采取反对立场，这更加证明，美国和其他帝国主义国家并没有改变它们对阿拉伯国家的政策，并且永远也不会改变它们的政策，除非这些帝国主义国家改变了社会制度。
    新华社巴格达12日电　伊拉克“国家报”12日发表评论指出，尽管出国访问的美国总统艾森豪威尔被某些人描写成“和平使者”，美国为大垄断资本的利益服务，为帝国主义制度服务的政策是不会改变的。这家报纸说，正当艾森豪威尔在访问一些亚洲国家，有些报纸称他是“和平使者”，而艾森豪威尔在每一个机场举帽向各国人民表示美国支持他们的自由和独立的时候，美国在竭力推行它敌视阿拉伯以及世界各地的民族解放运动的政策。这家报纸说，美国“最近在阿尔及利亚问题上所采取的立场，无非是帮助和支持法帝国主义者对战斗的阿尔及利亚人民进行野蛮的战争。”这家报纸说，“美国对任何要求自由和独立的人民，总是采取公然敌视的立场。在现代史上，美国从来没有支持和同情过任何一个解放运动的事例。事实上，美国的整个历史，特别是最近的历史，充满了反对解放的阿拉伯国家和其它解放的国家的目的在于破坏它们的自由和独立的阴谋。”
    这家报纸最后说，事实证明，只要美国的政策是为大垄断资本的利益、为帝国主义制度的利益服务——这种帝国主义制度一有机会就要统治其它国家——那么，美国的政策是不会改变的。
    这家报纸说，现在艾森豪威尔欺骗不了任何人了，因为各国人民都知道美国的言论和实际行动之间有着怎样的距离。
