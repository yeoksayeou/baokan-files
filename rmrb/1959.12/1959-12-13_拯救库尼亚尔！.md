    Save Cunhal!
    Liu Jingxi, Director of the China Political Science and Law Society, Vice President of Beijing College of Political Science and Law
    After seeing the news that the Portuguese Salazar dictatorial government was persecuting Alvaro Cunhal, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, and other patriots, I felt extremely indignant!
    Cunhal is a staunch communist, an outstanding leader of the workers' movement, and a fighter against fascism. Since he began participating in revolutionary activities at the age of eighteen, for decades he has unswervingly struggled to defend the interests of the Portuguese people and contributed all his strength. However, the Portuguese Salazar dictatorial government has continuously persecuted him, having arrested him three times and extended his sentence four times. Recently, before Cunhal's sentence was about to expire, the Salazar government attempted to illegally extend his sentence again, preventing him from gaining freedom. This is a savage destruction and persecution of the patriotic and democratic forces in Portugal, and a blatant manifestation of the fascist terror policy.
    Cunhal is a true patriot who is loyal to the Portuguese motherland and people; he is innocent. It is precisely the Portuguese government that harms the country and the people that is guilty. As everyone knows, due to the Salazar dictatorial regime's consistent implementation of traitorous policies, Portugal has been reduced to an appendage of American imperialism, the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the people's lives are extremely impoverished. In order to suppress the people's resistance, the fascist government is stepping up the persecution of patriots, a large number of communists have been arrested, and many patriotic people have been brutally murdered, and prisons are overcrowded. However, all these reactionary acts will absolutely not save the reactionary clique from its dying fate, but will only further expose their reactionary faces, thereby arousing more intense resistance from the people.
    In order to oppose the Salazar dictatorship and fight for democracy and freedom, the Portuguese people are further strengthening unity and unyieldingly fighting against the reactionaries. The movement demanding the release of political prisoners is sweeping the country, and the call for the release of Cunhal in particular resounds throughout the country. To date, thousands of signatures have been collected demanding that Cunhal be restored to freedom. We Chinese political and legal workers, together with the people of the whole country and the peace-loving people of the world, firmly support the just struggle of the Portuguese people. We protest against the Salazar government's illegal persecution of Cunhal and appeal to all honest people in the world: Cunhal and other Portuguese patriots must be saved!

    拯救库尼亚尔！
    中国政治法律学会理事北京政法学院副院长  刘镜西
    看到葡萄牙萨拉查独裁政府迫害葡萄牙共产党中央委员会书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔及其他爱国者的消息后，我感到十分愤慨！
    库尼亚尔是一位坚贞不屈的共产党员、杰出的工人运动的领袖和反法西斯主义的战士。从他十八岁开始参加革命活动时起，几十年来，始终不渝地为保卫葡萄牙人民利益进行斗争，贡献了他的全部力量。但是，葡萄牙萨拉查独裁政府竟不断地对他进行迫害，曾经三次把他逮捕入狱，四次延长刑期。最近，在库尼亚尔服刑期满之前，萨拉查政府又企图再一次非法延长他的刑期，不让他获得自由。这是对于葡萄牙爱国民主力量的野蛮摧残和迫害，是赤裸裸的法西斯恐怖政策的表现。
    库尼亚尔是忠于葡萄牙祖国和人民的真正爱国者，他没有罪。有罪的恰恰是祸国殃民的葡萄牙政府。大家知道，由于萨拉查独裁政权一贯执行卖国政策，葡萄牙已沦为美帝国主义的附庸，国民经济濒于破产，人民生活极端贫困。为了镇压人民的反抗，法西斯政府正在加紧对爱国人士的迫害，大批共产党员遭到逮捕，不少爱国志士被野蛮杀害，监狱人满为患。然而，所有这些倒行逆施的作法绝对挽救不了反动派的垂死命运，只会更加暴露他们的反动面目，从而激起人民更激烈的反抗。
    为了反对萨拉查独裁统治和争取民主自由，葡萄牙人民正在进一步加强团结、不屈不挠地同反动派进行斗争。要求释放政治犯的运动席卷全国，特别是要求释放库尼亚尔的呼声响彻各地。截至现在为止已有数以千计的签名要求让库尼亚尔恢复自由。我们中国政法工作者同全国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，坚决支持葡萄牙人民的正义斗争。我们抗议萨拉查政府对库尼亚尔的非法迫害，并向全世界正直的人民呼吁：必须拯救库尼亚尔和葡萄牙的其他爱国者！
