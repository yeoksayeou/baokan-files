Always Be a Vanguard of the Great Leap Forward
Li Fuxiang, National Advanced Producer, Boring Machine Operator at Shanghai Boiler Factory

　　1959 is about to pass, and people are stepping confidently into 1960.
　　Looking back on the past year, under the education of the Party, I dared to defy difficulties and humbly learned from everyone, achieving some results. In February of this year, with the development of the factory's production, improving the production efficiency of boring machines became one of the key factors for the factory's production. At this time, I accepted the task assigned to me by the Party, left the drilling machine where I had worked for six years, and went to operate the boring machine. At first, I couldn't even operate the forward and reverse gears of the boring machine properly. So, I humbly learned boring machine operation techniques and parts processing methods from experienced masters. The master workers taught me their skills without reservation. After more than a month, I mastered the operation techniques of the boring machine. However, I was always worried that the output could not be increased. At this time, the Party branch secretary of the workshop knew my concerns and said to me: "Although you are a novice on the boring machine, you have more than ten years of operating experience. As long as you are willing to use your brain to find tricks, and are not afraid of difficulties and are brave in innovation, you will definitely be able to achieve results." The Party instructed me to vigorously carry out technical innovation, so I focused on the key to production and, together with the master workers, successively improved several kinds of tools, which increased production efficiency by one or two times at once.
　　The workers in our group also carried out competitions, helping each other and learning from each other. Everyone put forward more than 100 technical innovation suggestions. Since August, the whole group has been in a full-red situation and has been rated as an advanced collective of the factory. I have also overfulfilled my production tasks every month. As of October 17, in six and a half months of actual working days, I completed the workload of one year and three months, and realized thirty-nine technical innovation suggestions, saving more than 34,000 working hours.
　　During my attendance at the National "Conference of Heroes," seeing the great achievements of national construction and thinking about the important tasks we shoulder, on the one hand, I felt infinitely more powerful, and on the other hand, I felt that the responsibility of building the motherland was heavy, and I felt that my contribution to the Party and the country was really too little. The Party has repeatedly taught us: "One flower does not make a spring, but a hundred flowers blooming make a spring." In the month or so after returning to the factory, with the support of the Party, I exchanged advanced experiences with brother factories. I introduced my own experience and also learned a lot of advanced experience from brother factories.
　　In the new year, I will always listen to the Party, muster greater efforts, humbly learn from others' advanced ideas and advanced technologies, strive to do the work of two and a half people alone, put forward sixty technical innovation suggestions, and achieve a good start, a red month, and a red year next year. To realize these plans, I will definitely encounter many difficulties. But under the leadership of the Party, I will work with everyone to carry out competitions, help each other and learn from each other, overcome all difficulties, ensure the overfulfillment of tasks, and be a vanguard of the continued Great Leap Forward.

　　永远做跃进的尖兵
　　全国先进生产者、上海锅炉厂镗工　李福祥
    1959年就要过去了，人们满怀信心地迈向1960年。
    回顾一年来，在党的教育下，我敢于藐视困难，虚心向一切人学习，做出了一些成绩。今年2月，随着厂里生产的发展，提高镗床生产效率成为全厂的生产关键之一。这时候，我接受了党分配给我的任务，离开了相处六年的钻床，到镗床上去操作。开初，我甚至连镗床顺车、倒车都开不好。我就虚心地向老师傅学习镗床操作技术和零件加工方法。老师傅毫不保留地把技术传授给我。经过一个多月的时间，我便掌握了镗床的操作技术。可是，我总愁着产量提不高。这时候，车间党支部书记知道了我的心事，就对我说：“虽然你在镗床上是个新手，但是你有十多年的操作经验，只要肯动脑筋找窍门、不怕困难勇于革新，你是一定能够做出成绩来的。”党指示我要大搞技术革新，我就针对生产关键，同老师傅一道接连改进了几种刀具，使生产效率一下子提高了一两倍。
    我们组里的工人也开展竞赛，相互帮助，相互学习，大家提出了一百多条技术革新建议。从8月份以来，全组满堂红的局面，并且被评选为厂的先进集体。我也月月超额完成了生产任务。到10月17日止，我在六个半月的实际工作日里，完成了一年零三个月的工作量，并且实现了三十九条技术革新建议，节约工时三万四千多个。
    出席全国“群英会”期间，看看国家建设的伟大成就，想想我们担负的重大任务，一方面浑身增添了无限的力量，一方面感到建设祖国的责任重大，觉得自己对党、对国家的贡献实在太少了。党一再教导我们：“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春”。我在回厂后的一个多月里，便在党的支持下，同兄弟厂一道交流了先进经验。我介绍了自己的经验，也学到了兄弟厂的很多先进经验。
    在新的一年里，我要永远听党的话，鼓足更大的干劲，虚心学习别人的先进思想和先进技术，争取一个人干两个半人的活，提出六十条技术革新建议，做到明年开门红、月月红、全年红。要实现这些打算，一定会遇到不少的困难。但是在党的领导下，我要跟大家一道，开展竞赛，互帮互学，克服一切困难，保证超额完成任务，作继续跃进的尖兵。
