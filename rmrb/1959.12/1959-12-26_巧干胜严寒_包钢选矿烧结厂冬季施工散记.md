Working Smartly Beats Severe Cold
——A Winter Construction Diary of Baotou Steel and Iron Complex's Ore Dressing and Sintering Plant
By Our Correspondent Wang Wenliang

    Severe cold envelops the Baotou Steel construction site. On the forest-like scaffolding, a thick layer of snow-white frost covers everything, and strings of icicles hang from the insulated straw around many concrete structures. However, as soon as you step onto the vast construction site of the ore dressing and sintering plant, the threat posed by the frozen ground and cold weather will be immediately dispelled by the bustling construction scene, and your blood will boil with enthusiasm.
    In the central mixing station, a constant stream of dump trucks, fully loaded with swirling steam from the concrete, race day and night towards the tippler room, crushing workshop, and the snake-like belt corridor construction sites. Winter is normally the off-season for concrete construction; however, here, despite the mixing efficiency having increased fivefold compared to the previous two months, each construction site is still clamoring for more concrete. The key concrete construction site—the tippler room—is yelling the loudest, saying that the concrete delivered in one hour is used up in fifteen minutes. “How can we let the soldiers at the front lines down?” The staff responsible for supplying materials and operating the mixing station are constantly pondering this question. After a heated discussion, they proposed: “No, we must be pace-setters in the Great Leap Forward, and we will never hold back the front lines! If materials are not enough, we will rely on our own efforts, and increase mixing efficiency even further; maintenance workers will be stationed to improve labor organization, ensuring that we mix as much as is poured at the front!” No sooner said than done, in ten days they used their own sand casting, self-made casting, and self-processed materials, and worked together to install ten self-made electric mills to produce wet ground slag concrete. These electric mills are expected to produce three thousand tons of self-made cement for the entire month of December. This made all the cement workers on the construction site very happy, as they climbed the scaffolding, waving vibrating rods, a chorus of "tut-tut-tut" of compacting concrete drowning out the sound of the on-site broadcast. The broadcasters had no choice but to run to the site to make oral encouragement, and timely disseminate everyone's advanced experiences. Some construction sites had so many people reporting good news that the Party Committee had to decide to have the Youth League secretary and the chairman of the Trade Union specifically deliver good news reports. The pouring of eight hundred meters of reinforced concrete for the second section of the tippler room's cylinder wall, due to its high-altitude construction, was estimated by the leadership to take three days to complete in order to set a record; however, the workers invented vertical transport machinery, and completed it in just over two days.
    Although earthwork is considered ordinary work, the site directors and Party branch secretaries on the construction site have all started lending a hand. Light railways were laid on each construction site, and cable slides were set up, multiplying the efficiency of digging soil. The foundation of the medium and fine crushing workshop needs to go sixteen meters underground; the design also took this situation into account, so before construction started, the leadership arranged for workers to install needle-shaped filters (drainage tools). However, before the pipes could be installed, the earthwork project had already caught up. In winter, any water will freeze; once it freezes, the work becomes much more difficult. At the belt corridor construction site, people have come up with many tricks to deal with the frozen soil as hard as rock: they first dig a pit, insert jacks used to lift cars from the loose soil to the bottom of the frozen soil, and lift upwards, and the frozen soil turns over in chunks. When it comes to earthwork, the young men at the main plant construction site are the most outstanding. Pushing and pulling the small carts, they run like the wind. However, they are not just working blindly. In addition to using jacks to lift the frozen soil, they are also experimenting with inserting bamboo tubes filled with quicklime into the frozen soil, pouring water from above, and then plugging the openings; when the lime expands upon contact with water, the frozen soil cracks. In this way, they have been overfulfilling their plans every day.
    With more and more projects starting, people have come up with many ways to overcome the difficulties of insufficient construction materials. At the main plant construction site, foundation concrete formwork has been completely replaced by hemp stalk formwork. On the 11th, the head office held a site meeting here, where it was observed that workers were wrapping hemp stalks with wire on wooden frames made from waste materials, and applying asphalt oil, which neither leaked grout nor had any less compressive strength compared to wooden formwork. Originally, just the ore dressing plant construction site alone would have used an estimated forty thousand cubic meters of wood just for supporting formwork; with the successful trial production of hemp stalk formwork, not even a fraction of that is needed. Now, the employees have also put forward the slogan of supporting aerialization, and they want to reduce the consumption of auxiliary materials in the project to a minimum.
    The Baotou Steel and Iron Complex's ore dressing and sintering plant is another key project that the country has started building here after Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace. The total amount of concrete to be poured and earthwork to be excavated for the entire project is even more than the cumulative amount of concrete and earthwork completed since the start of Baotou Steel's construction. One of its ancillary projects—the tailings dam—has an earthwork construction area of twelve square kilometers, which is several times larger than the city of Baotou before liberation. A month ago, how to transport this earthwork became a question that everyone on the construction site was considering.
    Take the tailings dam construction site as an example; it alone requires sixteen thousand cubic meters of stone masonry, and all the stones have to be transported from Hademen Gully, eight kilometers away. According to the construction schedule, it would require mobilizing one hundred trucks, working day and night, to transport the stones in order to meet the project's needs. However, how could Baotou Steel provide so many trucks for just one construction site! What to do?
    In order to solve this problem, the company's manager and Party Committee secretary personally went to the construction site to study with the workers and find ways to overcome the difficulties. A solution was found. It was to use trucks to tow tipper mine cars on light railway tracks for transportation. The method was good, but the construction period was tight, and, moreover, the six thousand rail spikes, eight thousand fishplates, fourteen thousand six hundred plus sleepers, and two hundred sixty-plus tons of light rails needed to lay the railway were nowhere to be found. When would this light railway be built?
    The heroic workers proposed: to complete it within ten days.
    In order to rush to make this batch of materials, all the blacksmith shops, iron melting furnaces, earthen lathes, and sand casting facilities that served the maintenance of construction machinery on the entire construction site were mobilized. The entire company, regardless of work type or section, all those who knew a little sand casting, casting, or lathe technology, took the initiative to offer support. The work was proceeding like a blazing fire. Cutting, punching, and straightening materials, everyone was chasing after each other, and the sixteen-pound hammers were hammering like raindrops. Outside the workshop, it was freezing cold, but inside the workshop, people were working with their shirts off. As a result, the eight-kilometer railway was not completed in ten days, but in seven days. Trucks towing tipper cars, hauling sixty at a time, improved transportation efficiency sixteen-fold after this "Red Flag Train" appeared on the construction site more than half a month ago. Truly: difficulties cannot stop determination, and severe cold cannot defeat heroes.
    Now, on the construction site of the ore dressing and sintering plant, there is a surging stream of construction workers and dazzlingly bright leaping red flags everywhere. Inspired by the Party's great call to "oppose Right-leaning tendencies and encourage hard work," the employees are determined to fight through winter and spring, to complete earthwork before winter, and to welcome the continued leap forward next year.

　　巧干胜严寒
　　——包钢选矿烧结厂冬季施工散记
　　本报记者　王文亮
    严寒笼罩着包钢工地。树林似的脚手架上，雪白的霜花厚厚一层，许多混凝土建筑物周围的保温稻草上，也挂起了一串串的冰凌。可是，当你一踏上规模巨大的选矿烧结厂工地，地冻天寒给你的威胁，立刻就会被工地上热气腾腾的建设景象所鼓舞，热血也沸腾起来了。
    在中央搅拌站里，川流不息的翻斗汽车，满载着团团蒸汽的混凝土，不分白天黑夜，向翻车机室、破碎车间和那长蛇似的皮带通廊工地奔驰而去。冬季，本来是混凝土施工的淡季；但是，在这里，尽管搅拌效率比前两个月提高了五倍，各个工地仍然叫喊着混凝土不够用。混凝土施工的重点——翻车机室工地叫喊的更凶，说是一个钟头运的混凝土，十五分钟就打完了。“怎么样，能给前方的战士们泄气吗？”负责供应材料和搅拌站的职工们，整日考虑着这个问题。经过一番热烈的讨论，他们提出：“不，我们要当大跃进的标兵，绝不拉前方的后腿！材料不够，我们自力更生，搅拌效率还要提高；检修工人坐镇，改进劳动组织，保证前方浇灌多少，我们搅拌多少！”说干就干，他们在十天内就自己翻砂、自己铸造、自己加工，一起动手安装起十台自制湿碾矿渣混凝土的电碾子。这些电碾子，预计12月全月可以自制水泥三千吨。这一下，可乐坏了全工地的水泥工，只见他们手攀脚手架，舞动震动棒，一片“突突突”的捣固混凝土的声音，把工地上广播的声音都淹没了。广播员们只好跑到现场上去作口头鼓动，及时传播大家的先进经验。有些工地因为报捷的人太多，党委只好决定由团支部书记和工会主席专门送喜报。翻车机室二节筒壁八百米钢筋混凝土的浇灌任务，因为在高空施工，领导上估计三天完成就能创造纪录；可是，工人们创造了垂直运输机具，两天多一点的时间就完成了。
    虽说土方工程是普通工的活，但工地上工地主任、党支部书记都动起手来了。各工地铺起了轻便铁路，架起了走线滑子，挖土效率成倍成倍地提高。中细破碎车间的基础，要深入地下十六米；设计的时候，也估计到了这种情况，因此，未开工以前，领导上就布置工人安设针状过滤器（排水工具）。可是，还没有等管子安下去，土方工程就赶上来了。冬天，一有水，就得结冰；结了冰，工作起来困难就多了。在皮带通廊工地，人们对付坚如岩石的冻土，想了不少窍门：人们先挖一个坑，把抬汽车用的千斤顶，从松土里插到冻土底下去，往上一顶，冻土就成块成块地翻身了。要说搞土方，还得数主厂房工地的小伙子们干得最出色。小车子一推一拉，跑起来就跟一阵风一样。可是，他们并不是蛮干。除了用千斤顶往上顶冻土以外，还试验把一根根装满生石灰的竹筒插到冻土里，从上面倒水，然后塞住上面的口，石灰见水一膨胀，冻土就裂开了。就这样，他们天天超额完成了计划。
    开工的工程愈来愈多，人们想了不少办法来克服部分建筑材料不足的困难。在主厂房工地上，基础混凝土模板已经完全被麻秸模板代替。11日，总公司在这里召开了现场会，只见工人们把麻秸用铁丝缠在用废料做成的木头架子上，抹上沥青油，既不露灰浆，抗压能力和木模板一模一样。原先，只一个选矿厂工地，据说光支模板就得用四万立方米木材，麻秸模板试制成功后，连一个零头也用不到了。现在，职工们又提出了支撑架空化的口号，他们要把工程上的辅助材料消耗降低到最低限度。
    包钢选矿烧结厂，是继包钢一号高炉之后，国家在这里动工兴建的另一项重点工程。全部工程需要浇灌的混凝土和挖去的土石方量，比包钢开始建设以来累计完成的混凝土和土石方工程量还要多。它的一项附属工程——尾矿坝，土石方施工面积就达十二平方公里，比解放前的包头城还大好几倍。一个月前，关于如何运送这些土石方，成了工地上人人考虑的问题。
    就以尾矿坝工地说吧，那里光砌石就需要十六万立方米，全部石头都得从八公里以外的哈德门沟去运。按工期算下来，需要动员一百辆汽车，日夜不停地拉运，才能满足工程需要。可是，包钢怎样能给这一个工地拿出这么多汽车呀！怎么办呢？
    为了解决这个问题，公司的经理、党委书记，亲自到工地去和工人研究，寻找克服困难的办法。办法找到了。是用汽车牵引翻斗矿车，在轻便铁道上拉运。办法是好，但是工期紧迫，而且，铺设铁道需要的六万多道钉，八千副鱼尾板，一万四千六百多根枕木，二百六十多吨轻便铁轨，一点着落也没有，什么时候这条轻便铁路才能修起来呢？
    英雄的工人们提出：十天内就把它修完。
    为了突击赶制这批材料，全工地所有为检修施工机器服务的铁匠炉、化铁炉、土车床、翻砂家具都动员起来了。全公司不分工种，不分区段，所有会一点翻砂、铸造、车工技术的，都主动提出支援。工作进行得真是一团火似的。截料的、冲眼的、调直的，你追我赶，十六磅重的大锤，敲得就跟雨点一样。车间外边天寒地冻，车间里的人们却在光着膀子干活。结果，一条八公里的铁路，不是十天，而是七天就铺设成功了。汽车牵引翻斗车，一次就拉六十个，自从半个多月前工地上出现了这种“红旗列车”以后，提高了运输效率十六倍。真是：困难挡不住决心，严寒难不倒英雄。
    现在，选矿烧结厂工地上，到处是滚滚的建设人流和鲜艳夺目的跃进红旗。被党的“反右倾、鼓干劲”的伟大号召所激励着的职工们，决心大战一冬春，土方不过冬，迎接明年的继续跃进。（附图片）
