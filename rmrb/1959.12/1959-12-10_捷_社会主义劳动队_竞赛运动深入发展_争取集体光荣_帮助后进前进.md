Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 8th: Our correspondent reports: In Czechoslovakia, the number of collectives participating in the competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" has recently grown to 9,000, of which 153 collectives have already won this glorious title. Recently, many collectives that have won the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" have also put forward proposals to learn from the advanced Soviet female worker Gaganova, to introduce their advanced experience to some backward collectives in order to lead them to advance. This has led the competition to develop in a new direction.

The competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" has been underway in Czechoslovakia for a year. Encouraged by the slogan "Work, study, and live in a socialist way," the laboring people's production enthusiasm and political consciousness have been improved. The movement has developed most rapidly and extensively in the metallurgy, machinery, coal mining, and railway transportation sectors. In the railway transportation sector, 1,400 collectives have participated in this competition. They fulfilled 440,000 socialist pledges in the third quarter of this year, saving a total of 95 million crowns. A team from the Kladno coal mine has not only fulfilled its production tasks well since May, but has also saved 3,000 crowns. They also actively participate in technical and political studies, and have done 500 hours of voluntary labor in their spare time. Three members of this team have been accepted as alternate members of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Due to the exemplary role they have played in all aspects, this collective has won the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade."

In every socialist competition launched by the Czechoslovak working people for major holidays, the collectives striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" are always at the forefront. In the gift-giving campaign to greet the 15th anniversary of National Day (1960), these collectives have overproduced 1.1 billion crowns worth of products and saved 500 million crowns. When discussing the 1960 production plan, all "Socialist Labor Brigades" raised their original planned targets.

The competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" has enhanced people's collectivist thinking. A new atmosphere of mutual concern, mutual assistance, and cooperation has emerged among team members and between collectives. Some backward workers have also become conscious and good laborers under the education of the collective.

Comrade Pik, who is in charge of mass movements at the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions, told our reporter about the achievements of the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade," saying that in addition to the production results, this competition has also shown great advantages in educating new socialist people. He pointed out that many collectives that have won the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" have sent their best members to help those backward units. They are working selflessly to help backward collectives catch up with the advanced level. The people participating in the competition have demonstrated a high sense of responsibility to the collective, and have shown great enthusiasm for further improving their politics and technology in order to become excellent new socialist people.

    捷“社会主义劳动队”竞赛运动深入发展
    争取集体光荣  帮助后进前进
    新华社布拉格8日电  本社记者报道：在捷克斯洛伐克，为争取“社会主义劳动队”称号而参加竞赛的集体最近已发展到九千个，其中有一百五十三个集体已获得了这一光荣称号。最近，许多获得了“社会主义劳动队”称号的集体还提出了学习苏联先进女工加干诺娃榜样的建议，要把自己的先进经验介绍给一些后进的集体，以便把它们带向先进。这样就使竞赛朝着一个新的方向发展。
    争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛运动，已在捷克斯洛伐克开展了一年。在“按社会主义方式工作、学习和生活”的口号的鼓舞下，劳动人民的生产积极性和政治觉悟都有了提高。在冶金、机械、煤矿和铁道运输部门中，这个运动开展得最为迅速而广泛。在铁道运输部门中，已有一千四百个集体参加了这个竞赛。它们在今年第三季度中实现了四十四万个参加竞赛的社会主义保证，共节约了九千五百万克朗。克拉德诺煤矿的一个小组，从5月份以来不仅生产任务完成得很好，而且还节约了三千克朗。他们还积极参加技术和政治学习，利用空余时间做了五百小时的义服劳动。这个小组里已有三人被接受为捷共候补党员。由于在各方面所表现的模范作用，这个集体已经荣获“社会主义劳动队”的称号。
    在捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民为重大节日而开展的每一次社会主义竞赛中，争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的集体总是走在前列。在迎接国庆十五周年（1960年）的献礼运动中，这些集体已超额生产了十一亿克朗的产品，节约了五亿克朗。在讨论1960年的生产计划时，所有的“社会主义劳动队”都提高了原订的计划指标。
    争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛增进了人们的集体主义思想。队员之间、集体之间出现了相互关心、互助协作的新风气。有一些后进的工人，在集体的教育下也成了有觉悟的好劳动者。
    捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会负责群众运动的皮克同志对本社记者谈到争取“社会主义劳动队”称号这一竞赛的成就时说，这一竞赛除了在生产上带来了成效外，在教育社会主义新人方面也显示出了巨大的优越性。他指出，现在已有许多获得了“社会主义劳动队”称号的集体派出他们之中最优秀的成员去帮助那些后进的单位。他们正在为帮助后进的集体赶上先进水平而忘我地劳动。参加竞赛的人们表现了对集体的高度责任感，表现了进一步提高政治和技术，以便成为优秀的社会主义新人的充沛热情。（附图片）
