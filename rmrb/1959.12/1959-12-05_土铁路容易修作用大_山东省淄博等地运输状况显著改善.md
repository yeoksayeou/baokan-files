Simple Railways are Easy to Build and Highly Effective
Transportation Conditions in Zibo, Shandong, and Other Places Significantly Improved

Jinan, December 4th (this newspaper) - In the spirit of self-reliance and making use of local materials, various parts of Shandong Province are using high-sulfur iron to cast rails and build simple railways. At present, more than 80 kilometers of simple railways have been built and are in operation throughout the province, and 16 small internal combustion and steam locomotives, and more than 490 vehicles have been manufactured.

The construction of simple railways has had a good effect on improving local transportation conditions. According to statistics from the transportation department, the volume of freight transported by these completed simple railways accounts for more than 8% of the total local transportation volume. After Boshan District of Zibo City built a simple railway of more than 4,900 meters long, crossing three mountains and seven ridges, and passing through nine ditches and ten bends, the daily transportation volume of more than 80 workers is equivalent to the daily transportation volume of more than 1,500 people before the road was built. It can save more than 1,400 manual handling labor and more than 1,700 yuan in handling costs every day. Although the problem of traction locomotives has not been solved for the simple railway built in Qufu County, Jining Prefecture, the transportation efficiency is still more than tripled with human pushing. The one-and-a-half-kilometer simple railway built by the Nandefu Coking Plant has a daily transportation volume equivalent to the daily transportation volume of more than 230 handcarts in the past, the transportation efficiency is increased by four and a half times, and the transportation cost is reduced by 73%. After the Zibo Mining Bureau built simple railways in various mine shafts, it quickly transported all the more than 20,000 tons of small kiln coal that had been backlogged for a long time, and achieved production and transportation balance.

In the process of building simple railways, the first difficulty encountered was the technical difficulties in route selection and measurement, casting rails with local iron, and building and laying rails. When solving these problems, the leading comrades in various places personally took action and deeply launched mass movements, and as a result, the difficulties were overcome one after another. For example, most of the rails cast with white iron in the Zibo area at the beginning were curved and not straight, with many pores, uneven rail heads, and uneven rail surfaces. The scrap rate was more than 80%. All the employees of the Zhangdian Hongxing Machinery Manufacturing and Repair Factory, who were responsible for casting rails, visited teachers and friends everywhere, and after painstaking research and many experiments, they finally found a way to improve the pile box, and made the bottom box solid and uniform, and controlled the moisture content of the molding sand at 8.9%. The cast rails have been technically tested and proved to be completely in compliance with technical standards in terms of tensile strength, bending strength, Brinell hardness, elongation, and metallographic structure.

Self-reliance and making use of local materials is an effective way for Shandong to solve the shortage of raw materials for building simple railways. In addition to the province allocating a certain amount of high-sulfur iron to various places for casting rails, almost all the steel, wood and other raw materials needed were solved by digging, saving, and substituting methods.

Zibo area, where the construction of simple railways is progressing faster, has collected a large number of usable waste materials by mobilizing the masses to "find treasures everywhere" and asking for materials from the three piles (coal piles, slag piles, and waste piles), meeting the needs of building simple railways. Jining area lacked steel to make splints, so they adopted high-sulfur iron casting and used it as a substitute after heat treatment, with good results.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the construction of simple railways. Responsible cadres of the Provincial Transportation Work Department, the Provincial Transportation Command, and the Provincial Department of Transportation often go deep into the site to guide the work, and help various places to study and solve some major problems in the construction, which has greatly promoted the construction of simple railways.

    土铁路容易修作用大
    山东省淄博等地运输状况显著改善
    本报济南4日电　山东省各地本着自力更生，就地取材的精神，用高硫铁铸成铁轨，修建土铁路。目前，全省已建成并通车的土铁路有八十多公里，并制造内燃、蒸汽小机车十六台，车辆四百九十多辆。
    土铁路的建成，对改善地方运输状况收到了良好的效果。根据交通部门的统计，这些建成的土铁路完成的货运量，约占地方交通总运量的8％以上。淄博市博山区修建一条四千九百多米、全线跨过三山七岭、经过九沟十弯的土铁路以后，八十多名工人的日运量就相当于修路前一千五百多人的日运量，每天可以节约一千四百多个搬运劳力和一千七百多元的搬运费。济宁专区曲阜县修建的土铁路，虽然牵引机车未获解决，在人推的情况下，运输效率仍然提高三倍多。南定焦厂建成的一公里半的土铁路，日运量相当于过去二百三十多辆手推车的日运量，运输效率提高四倍半，运输成本降低73％。淄博矿务局各矿井修建了土铁路之后，迅速把长期积压的两万多吨小窑煤全部运完，并且做到随产随运，产运平衡。
    在土铁路的建设过程中，遇到的第一个困难，是选线测量、用土铁铸轨和筑路铺轨等方面的技术困难。在解决这些难题的时候，各地领导同志都亲自动手，深入开展群众运动，结果使难关相继而破。例如，淄博地区用白口铁开始铸出来的铁轨大部分弯曲不直，气孔多、轨头不齐，轨面不光净，废品率达80％以上。担负铸轨任务的张店宏兴机械制修厂全体职工们，便到处访师问友，经过苦心钻研，多次试验，终于找到了改进桩箱的办法，将底箱桩实桩匀，控制型砂含水在8.9％，铸出来的铁轨经过技术鉴定证明，在抗拉、弯曲强度、布氏硬度、延伸率以及金相组织等方面，完全合乎技术标准。
    自力更生，就地取材，是山东各地修建土铁路解决原料材料不足的有效方法。除了省拨给各地一定数量的高硫铁用以铸造铁轨外，所需的钢材，木材等原料，各地几乎全部是通过挖、节、代等方法解决的。
    土铁路修建进度较快的淄博地区，通过发动群众，“遍地找宝”、向三堆（煤堆、渣堆、废料堆）要料的办法，搜集了大批可以利用的废旧材料，满足了修建土铁路的需要。济宁地区缺乏钢材制夹板，他们采取用高硫铁铸造，经过热处理后代用，效果良好。
    中共山东省委非常重视土铁路的建设工作，省委交通工作部、省运输指挥部、省交通厅等领导部门的负责干部，还经常深入现场指导这项工作，帮助各地研究解决修建中的一些重大问题，这对土铁路修建工作，起了极大的推动作用。（附图片）
