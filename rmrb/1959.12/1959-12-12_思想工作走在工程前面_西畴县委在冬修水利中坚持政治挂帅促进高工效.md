Ideological Work Precedes Engineering
Xichou County Party Committee Adheres to Putting Politics in Command to Promote High Work Efficiency in Winter Water Conservancy Construction

    (Our dispatch) The Xichou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yunnan Province, in its winter water conservancy construction work, adheres to putting politics in command and carries out lively and diverse political and ideological work, enabling the laborers to be full of energy. The high work efficiency competitions and technical innovation movements in various construction sites throughout the county are being carried out vigorously. More than 20,000 laborers in the county have seen their work efficiency rapidly increase from an initial average of 1.5 cubic meters per person per day to around 8 cubic meters. The county has successively won the Water Conservancy High Work Efficiency Red Flag of the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture twice.
    Xichou County's planned engineering volume for this winter and next spring is five times greater than last year. The task is large, the time is tight, and the labor force is not very sufficient. In response to this situation, the county party committee decided to adhere to putting politics in command, boldly mobilizing the masses, and relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses to ensure the completion of the project as scheduled. At the beginning of the water conservancy project, the county party secretary personally took command. Relying on the Party and Youth League organizations, they carried out in-depth and meticulous ideological education work among the masses. The county party committee directly controlled all six large and medium-sized projects. The key project, the Nanchang Reservoir, was specifically managed by two county party committee members, with a strong leadership core consisting of four commune party committee secretaries, seven committee members, three commune directors, and sixteen management area cadres. Party committees were established at the large water conservancy construction sites. Thirteen party branches and twenty Youth League branches were established at various construction sites, with an average of one Party or Youth League member for every nineteen laborers, ensuring organizational support for political and ideological work.
    Under the direct leadership of the Party committees and branches at the construction sites, various sites immediately launched major debates on issues such as "For Whom is Water Conservancy Being Built?" and "Can Construction Be Accelerated?". During the debate, laborers from the Banggu Commune said that our Changqing Management Area is a mountainous region, and before liberation, we had never even tasted rice soup. Since the Great Leap Forward, the commune has led us to build water conservancy projects, turning the old Qianbai Mountains into watery terraced fields. Not only has grain production greatly increased, but we have also started eating fragrant rice. If we didn't build water conservancy, how could we live such a good life? The Shiqiao Reservoir construction site has continuously improved its clearing efficiency due to boosting morale. The laborer Zhang Chaoke used this fact to illustrate to everyone that improving work efficiency is entirely possible and that water conservancy projects can be built quickly. Party organizations at various construction sites also used various forms of propaganda to conduct socialist education among the broad masses of laborers, inspiring the laborers' revolutionary enthusiasm for large-scale water conservancy construction. The Nanchang Reservoir Party organization set up an exhibition hall at the construction site, exhibiting materials on the great harvest brought about by large-scale water conservancy construction since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, as well as the beautiful prospects of basically solving the county's rice field water use problem next year after this year's large-scale water conservancy construction. The laborers were filled with enthusiasm after seeing the exhibition. They sang: "The Nanchang Reservoir is wide and long, the laborers are busy at the front, build the reservoir to irrigate the fields, and villages will produce more grain." Twenty-four propaganda teams were organized and eighty-nine broadcasting stations were set up in various construction sites throughout the county. These propaganda organizations used forms that were popular with the laborers to promote the benefits of large-scale water conservancy construction and spread the advanced deeds and advanced figures emerging from various construction sites in various occasions, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses.
    After clarifying the issues of "For Whom is Water Conservancy Being Built?" and "Can Construction Be Accelerated?", the county party committee organized a heated high work efficiency competition movement throughout the county. At the Nanchang Reservoir, 907 high work efficiency experts and technical innovation experts emerged in the skill contest. The construction site headquarters immediately commended them and used them as models to launch a competition movement between brigades, between teams, between squads, between groups, and between individuals throughout the construction site, so that the average work efficiency of the entire construction site increased from the original two cubic meters to more than thirteen cubic meters. Then, the county party committee used the Nanchang Reservoir as a model for the county's high work efficiency competition, held an on-site meeting here, and disseminated experience. After the meeting, a new situation of one leap after another quickly appeared in various construction sites throughout the county. The laborers worked hard and sang happily: We want to make the mountains and waters listen to our commands, we want to turn barren mountains into fertile fields. If the dragon doesn't turn over, it will rain, if the rain doesn't sprinkle the flowers, the flowers will bloom, floods and droughts will be eliminated forever, and happy life will last forever.

    The Taiping Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, established a Party school at the Yaogang water conservancy construction site, using rest time to study the Party's general line and the current situation. At the same time, combined with the specific situation of the commune, they discussed how to build water conservancy projects more, faster, better, and more economically. Party members participating in the water conservancy project all studied at the Party school, and some Youth League members and activists were also absorbed to participate. Through Party lessons, the students' class consciousness was improved, and their labor enthusiasm was even higher. They united the masses and took the lead in everything. Look how energetically these students are working! Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Xinning

    思想工作走在工程前面
    西畴县委在冬修水利中坚持政治挂帅促进高工效
    本报讯　中共云南省西畴县委会在冬修水利工作中，坚持政治挂帅，开展生动活泼、多种多样的政治思想工作，使民工们干劲十足，全县各工地的高工效竞赛和技术革新运动都开展得有声有色。全县两万多民工，工效由最初每人每天平均一点五个土方迅速提高到八方左右。连续两次获得文山僮族苗族自治州的水利高工效红旗。
    西畴县今冬明春计划完成的工程量，比去年大五倍。任务大，时间紧，劳力不大足。针对这种情况，县委决定坚持政治挂帅，放手发动群众，依靠广大群众的积极性和创造性来保证工程如期完成。水利工程一开始，县委书记就亲自指挥，依靠党团组织向群众进行了深入细致的思想教育工作。全县六个大、中型工程，都由县委直接掌握；重点工程南昌水库，由两个县委委员具体负责，并由四个公社党委书记、七个委员、三个公社社长、十六个管理区干部，组成了坚强的领导核心。大的水利工地都成立了党委会。各工地共成立了十三个党支部，二十个团支部，平均每十九个民工中就有一个党、团员，使政治思想工作有了组织保证。
    在工地党委、支部的直接领导下，各个工地立即开展了“为谁修水利”、“能不能快修”等问题的大辩论。辩论中，蚌谷公社的民工说，我们长箐管理区是个高山地区，解放前连米汤都没有喝过。大跃进以来，公社领导我们修了水利，把千百年的老干山变成了水汪汪的梯田，不仅粮食获得大增产，还吃上了香喷喷的大米饭。不是修水利，哪能过上这么好的生活？石桥水库工地由于鼓足干劲，清基工效一再提高。民工张朝科用这个事实，向大家说明提高工效是完全可能的，水利工程能够快修。各工地党组织还运用各种宣传形式，向广大民工进行社会主义教育，鼓起民工大修水利的革命干劲。南昌水库党组织在工地办起了展览馆，展出解放后特别是大跃进以来大兴水利带来大丰收的材料，以及今年大修水利后，明年全县稻田用水便能基本解决的美好前景。民工们看了展览会，干劲油然而生。他们唱道：“南昌水库宽又长，民工上阵忙又忙，修好水库灌田地，村村寨寨多打粮。”全县各工地共组织了二十四个宣传队，设立了八十九个广播站。这些宣传组织在各种场合，运用民工们喜闻乐见的形式，宣传大修水利的好处，传播各个工地涌现出来的先进事迹和先进人物，以鼓舞群众干劲。
    在明确了“为谁修水利”、“能不能快修”等问题以后，县委又在全县范围内组织了热火朝天的高工效竞赛运动。南昌水库在比武活动中，涌现了九百零七个高工效能手和技术革新能手。工地指挥部立即进行了表扬，并以他们做标兵，在全工地开展了大队与大队、中队与中队、小队与小队、组与组、个人与个人之间的竞赛运动，使全工地平均工效由原来的两方提高到十三方以上。接着，县委就以南昌水库做全县高工效竞赛的标兵，在这里召开了现场会议，传播经验。会后，全县各工地迅速出现了一跃再跃的新局面。民工们一面紧张地劳动，一面愉快地歌唱道：要叫山水听使唤，要叫荒山变良田。龙不翻身要下雨，雨不洒花花要开，涝灾旱灾永消灭，幸福生活万万年。（附图片）
    湖北省枣阳县太平公社在姚岗水利工地办了一所党校，利用休息时间学习党的总路线和目前形势。同时，结合本公社的具体情况，讨论如何多、快、好、省地兴修水利。参加水利工程的党员都在党校学习，还吸收部分共青团员、积极分子参加。通过党课学习，提高了学员们的阶级觉悟，他们劳动热情更加高涨，团结群众，事事带头。看这些学员们干得多带劲！　新华社记者　刘心宁摄
