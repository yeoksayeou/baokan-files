    Ten Percent Seedling Survival This Winter, Ten Percent Harvest Next Year
    Jiangxi Strives to Enhance Winter Hardiness of Rapeseed
    Zhejiang Manages Winter Crops with High Standards

    Our newspaper, Nanchang, 11th dispatch – Jiangxi is taking early steps to enhance the winter hardiness of rapeseed in various locations.

    Jiangxi's rapeseed planting area has increased by one million mu compared to last year, and the sowing quality is also better than last year. Currently, rapeseed plants are growing vigorously, generally four inches tall, with five or six true leaves, and Grade One seedlings account for more than 70%. Now that winter has arrived, rapeseed seedlings are tender, susceptible to cold and frost, and vulnerable to both drought and waterlogging. If winter management is inadequate, growth and yield will inevitably be affected. Currently, some areas do not attach sufficient importance to this work. To address this, people's communes in various locations have organized debates among members on the topic of "How to Protect Rapeseed Over Winter," thereby boosting enthusiasm and immediately taking measures to strive for "ten percent seedling survival this winter, ten percent harvest next year."

    Timely replanting and setting seedlings to ensure full stands is one of the measures taken by Jiangxi to enhance the winter hardiness of rapeseed. Various locations have rationally arranged a group of laborers to carry out replanting and setting work. Chongren County conducted a comprehensive inspection of the county's 100,000 mu of rapeseed, organizing more than 10,000 laborers to replant seedlings, resulting in the replanting of more than one million plants within three days, achieving full stands in every field. Fengcheng County launched a "two-check" campaign for rapeseed, organizing experienced farmers, technicians, and cadres to check for missing seedlings and weak seedlings. This revealed that there were more than 60,000 mu of fields with missing or weak seedlings, which were then quickly replanted. Currently, the replanting work has basically ended throughout the province, and seedling selection and setting are underway.

    Another measure taken by Jiangxi to enhance the winter hardiness of rapeseed is early cultivation and topdressing to cultivate strong seedlings before winter. The main methods are: 1. Three cultivations are carried out before winter in conjunction with setting seedlings to loosen the soil, increase water and fertilizer retention capacity, and promote root development. 2. Three topdressings are carried out in combination with cultivation, generally applying 10 to 20 dan of decomposed human manure fertilizer per mu. In Shangrao Prefecture, large ridges were made and deep ditches were dug in the rapeseed fields, with ridges five chi wide and ditches seven cun deep, to ensure that water drains away after rain and the land is dry on sunny days, preventing waterlogging damage to rapeseed.

    In order to protect rapeseed from severe cold, many areas in Jiangxi have made early preparations for frost and freeze prevention. The main methods in various locations are: 1. Soil is mounded around the base of the plants to prevent the roots from being broken by soil heaving during freezing. 2. A "wax fertilizer" is applied before the cold wave arrives, which can both raise soil temperature and prepare fertilizer for later growth. 3. Covering with lake grass and rice straw. In addition to mounding soil around the base of the rapeseed, Pingxiang County also applied more than 400 dan of stir-fried soil ash, wood ash, and pond mud per mu of field, and made all effective preparations for cold protection.

    Based on the situation in previous years when early bolting and flowering before winter were prone to frost damage, the following measures were also taken to prevent early flowering: 1. Apply fast-acting fertilizers early to help seedlings develop into strong seedlings as soon as possible. 2. Immediately pinch off the flowering stems after bolting and flowering to promote strong stems and leaves, large disks and thick stalks, and increase resistance to wind and cold. In addition, various locations paid early attention to the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and universally sprayed "666" pesticide, cottonseed oil soap, lime water, and other pesticides to ensure that rapeseed seedlings are not harmed by insects during cold resistance and also enhance cold resistance.

    In the field management activities to enhance the winter hardiness of rapeseed, party committees at all levels in Jiangxi have strengthened leadership, designated secretaries to be specifically responsible, and cadres at all levels have all created experimental fields.

    Currently, rapeseed throughout the province has generally undergone two cultivations and weeding and one topdressing, with more than 15 dan of topdressing per mu; among them, half of the rapeseed fields have been covered with lake grass and rice straw in combination with cultivation, and drainage ditches have been opened. Now more than 500,000 commune members are continuing to carry out management activities in the fields to protect rapeseed over winter. (Liu Guanghui)

    Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 11th dispatch – Zhejiang is vigorously carrying out a high-standard cultivation management competition for winter crops with the spirit of early management, diligent management, and careful management.

    This year, the planting area of wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, peas, and grass seeds in Zhejiang has increased by 3 million mu compared to 1958, and the vast majority meet the requirements of deep plowing and close planting, and the season is also about ten days earlier than in previous years. These crops are now growing well.

    According to high-standard cultivation requirements, various locations are focusing on the cultivation of high-yield fields and experimental fields, establishing models to drive large fields, and comprehensively carrying out the "red, diligent, and skillful" competition in winter crop management. In Ningbo Prefecture, more than 11,000 advanced field management model units were established at every level from the county to the production team, and more than 300,000 cadres and commune members visited advanced units to learn. Currently, 907 production teams in the entire prefecture have achieved wide ridges and deep ditches, no water accumulation in the fields, comprehensive strong seedlings, and no weeds, realizing the gardening of management.

    Party committees at all levels throughout the province also continuously organize cadres to go deep into the fields to drive commune members to carry out a major inspection of winter crops, so that the level of cultivation management is continuously improved. After the rapeseed planting was completed, eight counties including Pinghu and Tongxiang in Jiaxing Prefecture proposed the slogan of "planting spring flowers like planting vegetables," and organized more than 30,000 cadres above the level of small team leader, led by the county party committee and commune party committee secretaries, to go to the fields for inspection. Haining County found that some rapeseed was harmed by aphids and virus diseases during the inspection, and immediately carried out prevention and control, and all have now been applied with pesticides.

    今冬十成苗　明年十成收
    江西千方百计增强油菜越冬能力
    浙江以高标准要求管好冬种作物
    本报南昌11日电　江西各地及早采取各种措施增强油菜越冬能力。
    江西今年油菜播种面积比去年扩大了一百万亩，播种质量也比去年好。目前各地油菜生长茁壮，一般苗高四寸，有五、六片真叶，一类苗占70％以上。现在冬季已到，油菜苗嫩，畏寒畏冻，怕旱又怕涝，如果冬季管理不好，势必影响生长，影响增产。目前有部分地区没有十分重视这项工作。为此，各地人民公社以“怎样保护好油菜过冬”为题，组织社员开展了辩论，从而鼓起了干劲，并立即采取了措施，力争油菜“今冬十成苗，明年十成收”。
    及早补苗定苗，保证全苗，是江西各地增强油菜越冬能力的措施之一。各地已合理安排了一批劳力，突击补苗定苗工作。崇仁县对全县十万亩油菜全面进行了一次检查，组织了一万多个劳力进行补苗，结果三天内就补苗一百多万株，达到了丘丘全苗。丰城县开展了油菜“两查”活动，组织老农、技术员和干部查缺苗、查弱苗，结果查出缺苗弱苗田六万多亩，随之突击补齐。目前全省各地补苗工作已经基本结束，正在选苗和定苗。
    江西各地增强油菜越冬能力的另一措施，是提早中耕追肥，冬前培育壮苗。主要办法有：一、冬前结合定苗进行三次中耕，疏松土壤，增加保水保肥能力，促进根部发育；二、结合中耕进行三次追肥，一般每亩追施腐熟性人粪尿肥十担至二十担。上饶专区各地在油菜田里作大畦、挖深沟，畦宽五尺，沟深七寸，做到了雨停水干、天晴地爽，防止了油菜涝害。
    为了保护油菜渡过严寒，江西许多地区提早做好了防霜防冻的工作。各地的主要办法是：一、培土壅兜，防止冰冻期间抬土断根；二、寒潮来之前施一次腊肥，既能提高土温又为后期生长准备了肥料；三、覆盖湖草、稻草。萍乡县对油菜进行了培土壅兜之外，每亩田还追施了四百多担炒土灰、草木灰和塘泥，并作好了防寒的一切有效的准备工作。
    根据往年冬前发生过早抽苔开花容易受冻害的情况，各地还采取了下列防止早花的措施：一是早追速效性肥料，使苗早日育成壮苗；二是在抽苔开花后立即摘苔，促使茎叶粗壮，盘大秆粗，增加对风寒的抵抗力。此外，各地及早注意了防治病虫害，普遍喷射了一次“六六六”药剂、棉油皂、草石灰水等农药，保证了油菜苗在抗寒当中不受虫害，也增强了抗寒能力。
    在开展增强油菜越冬能力的田间管理活动中，江西各级党委都加强了领导，指定了书记专门负责，各级干部都搞了试验田。
    目前，全省油菜已普遍进行了二次中耕除草和一次追肥，每亩追肥十五担以上；其中有一半油菜田已结合中耕加盖了湖草、稻草，开辟了排水沟。现在五十多万名社员正在田间继续开展保护油菜过冬的管理活动。　（刘光辉）
    本报杭州11日电　浙江各地正以早管勤管细管的精神，大搞冬种作物高标准培育管理竞赛。
    今年浙江大小麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆和草子的种植面积比1958年扩大了三百万亩，绝大部分符合深耕、密植的要求，季节也比往年提早了十天左右。这些作物现在都生长良好。
    各地根据高标准培育要求，大抓丰产畈、试验田的培育，大立标兵来带动大田，全面开展了冬种作物管理“红勤巧”竞赛。宁波专区从县到生产队，层层树立了一万一千多个田间管理先进标兵单位，有三十多万名干部、社员到先进单位参观学习。目前，全专区已有九百零七个生产队做到了阔畦深沟、田无积水、全面壮苗、不见杂草，实现了管理园田化。
    全省各级党委还不断组织干部深入田间，带动社员群众开展冬种作物大检查，使培育管理水平不断提高。嘉兴专区的平湖、桐乡等八个县，在油菜种植结束以后，提出了要像种蔬菜一样种好春花的口号，并组织小队长以上的干部三万多人，由县委和公社党委书记带领前往田间检查。海宁县在检查中发现有部分油菜受蚜虫、毒素病为害，立即进行防治，目前已全部施上药剂。
