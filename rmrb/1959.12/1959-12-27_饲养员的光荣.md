　　The Glory of Animal Husbandry Workers

　　The Torbukhin State Farm is famous for producing meat, milk, and eggs. It is one of the best farms in Bulgaria and has won the national championship twice.

　　The farm's animal husbandry workers are skilled breeders. Many of them have been awarded medals for their labor achievements: Vilchev, the production team leader of the dairy farm, was awarded the Dimitrov Medal and the Gold Medal for Labor; Gospodinov, a breeder, received the Gold Medal twice; Stoyev, a milkmaid, is a recipient of the Gold and Silver Labor Medals; and Ninchev is a recipient of the Silver Labor Medal.

　　The dairy farm has spacious cattle pens, automatic waterers, and feeding troughs. Three hundred high-quality cattle are cared for by experienced workers. In the next three years, the herd will increase to five hundred.

　　The names of the sheep breeders Dimitrov, Georgiev, and Nonchev of this farm are well-known throughout the Dobruja region. They have done a lot of work in improving sheep breeds. As a result of their work, the farm will have 12,000 Merino sheep in three years.

　　The pig breeders also do excellent work. They have reduced the consumption required per kilogram of live weight by feeding dry food and installing automatic waterers.

　　Currently, the pig farm has 2,600 fattening pigs and 160 sows. Each person can take care of 350 pigs.

　　Currently, the animal husbandry workers of the Torbukhin State Farm are striving to complete the Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) two years ahead of schedule. (Attached pictures)

　　饲养员的光荣
    托尔布欣城的国营农场以出产肉类、牛奶和蛋类闻名，它是保加利亚最好的农场之一，曾经两次获得了全国冠军。
    农场的饲养员是内行的饲养能手。其中许多人为自己的劳动成绩荣获奖章：奶牛场的生产队长维尔切夫荣获季米特洛夫奖章和金质劳动奖章，饲养员戈斯波迪诺夫二次获得金质奖章，挤奶员斯托耶夫是金质和银质劳动奖章获得者，宁切夫是银质劳动奖章获得者。
    奶牛场里有宽敞的牛圈、自动饮水器和食槽。由经验丰富的工人照顾三百头良种牛。在今后三年内牛群将增加到五百头。
    这个农场的饲羊员季米特洛夫、格奥尔基耶夫、诺恩切夫的名字传闻整个多布鲁查地区。他们在改良羊种方面做了许多工作，由于他们的工作，三年后农场将有一万二千头美利奴羊。
    养猪员的工作也很出色，他们用喂干食和装设自动饮水器的方法，降低了每公斤毛重所需要的消耗。
    目前养猪场共有二千六百头肥猪和一百六十头母猪。每人能照管三百五十头猪。
    现在，托尔布欣国营农场的饲养员正在为争取提前两年完成五年计划（1958—1962年）而奋斗。（附图片）
