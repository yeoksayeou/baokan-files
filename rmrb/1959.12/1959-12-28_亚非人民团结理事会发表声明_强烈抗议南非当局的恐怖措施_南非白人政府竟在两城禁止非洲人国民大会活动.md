　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 23rd: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council today issued a statement strongly protesting the terrorist measures taken by the white government of the Union of South Africa in Southwest Africa, and expressed full support for the sacred struggle of the people of Southwest Africa.

　　The statement said that the incident of forcing Africans to migrate from the Windhoek area, which resulted in the sacrifice of twelve Africans, has aroused the indignation of the people of the world, especially the people of Asian and African countries.

　　The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council requested the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees of various countries to support the struggle of the people of Southwest Africa and to send telegrams to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to express their attitude. The statement called on the white rulers to stop racial discrimination and the barbaric actions taken against Africans.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: Pretoria News: The South African Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, de Wet Nel, announced in a government gazette on the 24th that the African National Congress of South Africa and other organizations opposing racial discrimination policies are prohibited from carrying out activities in the African residential areas of Pietersburg and Potgietersrust.

　　The ban also stipulates that no one may enter or leave these two African residential areas without the permission of the authorities.

　　At the same time, the Transvaal authorities in South Africa have proposed a new draft law, which stipulates that segregation should be extended to laundries. Laundries must wash white people's clothes and non-white people's clothes separately, and must not mix them together. This bill will be voted on in the Transvaal State Assembly in February.

　　Four prominent South Africans wrote a letter on the 20th to British Prime Minister Macmillan, who will visit Africa next month, condemning the racial discrimination policies implemented by the South African government.

　　These four South African figures are: Albert Luthuli, President of the African National Congress of South Africa, writer Alan Paton, journalist Zhou Geban, and President of the South African Indian Congress, Nake. They said in the letter that the apartheid policy is "evil and unfair, and it is a contempt for people."

　　According to news from Windhoek, the South African authorities today sentenced an African named Kugumbrala to five months of hard labor and four lashes in Windhoek, Southwest Africa, on charges of disrupting "public order." Kugumbrala had participated in a demonstration a few days ago to protest against the South African government's forced relocation of Africans from Windhoek to a newly built non-white town nearby. At that time, the military police opened fire on the demonstrators, killing twelve Africans and wounding sixty.

　　亚非人民团结理事会发表声明
    强烈抗议南非当局的恐怖措施
    南非白人政府竟在两城禁止非洲人国民大会活动
    新华社开罗23日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天发表声明，强烈抗议南非联邦白人政府在西南非洲所采取的恐怖措施，并表示充分支持西南非洲人民的神圣斗争。
    声明说，使十二个非洲人牺牲的强迫非洲人从温得和克地区迁移的事件激起全世界，特别是亚非各国人民的愤慨。
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处要求各国的亚非团结委员会支持西南非洲人民的斗争，并致电联合国秘书长表明它们的态度。声明要求白种人统治者停止种族歧视和对非洲人采取野蛮的行动。
    新华社25日讯　比勒陀利亚消息：南非联邦政府非洲人行政和开发部部长德威特尼尔24日在一个政府公报中宣布，禁止反对种族歧视政策的南非非洲人国民大会和其他组织在彼得斯堡和波吉特斯勒斯特两城的非洲人居住区进行活动。
    这项禁令还规定，没有得到当局的许可，任何人都不得进入或者离开这两个非洲人居住区。
    同时，南非德兰斯瓦尔州当局已经提出一项新的法律草案，这项法案规定要把种族隔离扩大到洗衣店，洗衣店必须把白人的衣服和非白人的衣服分开来洗，而不得混在一起。这项法案将于2月间在德兰斯瓦尔州议会中表决。
    南非四位著名人士曾在20日写信给将在下个月到非洲访问的英国首相麦克米伦，谴责南非联邦政府所执行的种族歧视政策。
    这四位南非人士是：南非非洲人国民大会主席卢图利、作家阿兰·佩顿、新闻记者周格班和南非印度人大会主席纳克。他们在信中说，种族隔离政策是“罪恶和不公平的，它是对人们的蔑视”。
    据来自温得和克的消息说，南非当局今天在西南非洲温得和克以破坏“公共秩序”罪名批处一位名叫库贡布腊的非洲人五个月的苦役和挨打四鞭。库贡布腊在几天前曾经参加示威游行，抗议南非政府强迫非洲人从温得和克迁移到附近一个新建的非白人城镇去。当时，军警向示威群众开枪，打死非洲人十二名，打伤六十名。
