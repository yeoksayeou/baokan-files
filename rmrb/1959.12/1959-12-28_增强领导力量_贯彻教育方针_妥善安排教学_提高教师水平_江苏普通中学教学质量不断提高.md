　　Strengthen Leadership, Implement the Education Policy, Properly Arrange Teaching, Improve Teacher Level:
    Jiangsu's Ordinary Secondary School Teaching Quality Continuously Improves

    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Reporter Bao Chunguang reports: Party committees and education departments at all levels in Jiangsu Province have adopted effective measures based on the Party's education policy to ensure the improvement of teaching quality in ordinary secondary schools in all aspects, and have achieved good results.

    Jiangsu Province currently has more than 1,600 ordinary secondary schools with more than 690,000 students, an increase of nearly four times and more than six times the number of students compared to 1949. Party committees and education departments at all levels attach great importance to strengthening the leadership of ordinary secondary schools in improving the quality of teaching. Since 1955, party committees at all levels have transferred more than 600 county committee members, county heads, directors of cultural and educational bureaus, and cadres from government offices to ordinary secondary schools to do leadership work. At present, the principals of complete middle schools throughout the province are mostly cadres with levels equivalent to county party secretaries, committee members, and departmental chiefs of the prefectural committee. In addition, many regions have also promoted some politically strong and professionally knowledgeable veteran teachers to take on leadership roles in schools. The strengthening of political and professional leadership in schools is a prerequisite for the resolute implementation of the Party's education policy and the continuous improvement of teaching quality.

    Since the launch of work-study programs last spring, ordinary secondary schools in various places have engaged in production labor by adapting to local conditions and using local materials. After the publication of the Central Committee's instructions on education work, the integration of education with productive labor was comprehensively implemented, and more than 700 factories were established, and a large number of farms were opened up, basically establishing labor bases. All schools have incorporated production labor into the formal curriculum, making production labor systematic, regular, and integrated with teaching. After the integration of teaching and productive labor, the content of teachers' teaching has been enriched. After some teachers in Nanjing personally assembled radios in radio factories, they gave vivid and popular lectures to students on the transmission of radio waves and other knowledge. After the integration of teaching and productive labor, students have a solid grasp of knowledge and an enhanced ability to solve practical problems. For example, Nanjing No. 9 Middle School has made significant improvements in student academic performance because of its excellent production labor. Taking the third grade Class B of the school as an example: Compared with the first semester of 1958, the number of students with physics scores above 80 rose from 25 to 42, and there were no failing grades. The performance of other subjects such as Chinese, algebra, geometry, and chemistry has also improved significantly.

    The continuous improvement of the teaching quality of ordinary secondary schools also depends on the strengthening of leadership and arrangement of teaching work by leaders at all levels. Since the Central Committee put forward the education policy last year, the Provincial Party Committee has regarded the resolute implementation of this policy as the most central task in leading education work. In order to correctly implement this policy, the Provincial Party Committee, at the provincial conference on propaganda, culture, and education work, criticized the erroneous ideas of "labor replacing teaching" and "labor is teaching" on the one hand; on the other hand, it criticized the bourgeois educational ideas that "teaching cannot be done well if labor production is done well" and "labor production affects teaching." This spring, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, the Provincial Party Committee further clarified that improving the quality of education should be a comprehensive improvement in moral, intellectual, and physical education. As for full-time schools, special attention should be paid to improving the quality of teaching, and full-time schools should be required to treat improving the quality of teaching as the most important and regular central task. Since the beginning of this year, most prefectures, cities, and counties have organized large-scale inspections of educational quality, and many schools have also organized various forms of teaching quality inspections themselves, focusing on improving teaching quality to improve all aspects of the school's work. In order to improve the quality of teaching, the province also emphasized that school leaders must personally teach classes and learn from teaching practice to lead teaching. At present, most of the leading cadres of ordinary secondary schools in the province are teaching courses concurrently, and a few who still have difficulties in teaching are actively preparing conditions for teaching. The cultural and educational leadership departments in many regions are equipped with cadres familiar with teaching business to strengthen the leadership of the teaching work of their affiliated schools. Education leadership departments adopt a combination of key and general methods for the teaching leadership of various courses. Education departments from the province to the prefecture, city, and county all emphasize grasping the teaching of major subjects such as Chinese, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In order to improve the quality of Chinese teaching, the Provincial Department of Education regularly summarizes Chinese teaching experience and puts forward practical and feasible suggestions for improving Chinese teaching to ordinary secondary schools throughout the province. In the teaching of various courses, special emphasis is placed on basic training. For example, in Chinese teaching, a series of specific requirements are stipulated.

    The most fundamental measure for Jiangsu Province to improve the quality of teaching in ordinary secondary schools lies in improving the political and professional level of teachers and better playing the leading role of teachers. The political and ideological awareness of teachers in ordinary secondary schools throughout the province has been improved through previous political movement education. Before the anti-Rightist movement, Party members and Youth League members accounted for 25.9% of the teachers in ordinary secondary schools throughout the province, and this has now risen to 36.9%. At present, teachers and students throughout the province have established new teacher-student relationships under the leadership of the Party. The "five seriousnesses" proposed by the Department of Education, namely, teachers should seriously prepare lessons, seriously teach, seriously tutor, seriously correct homework, and seriously examine student grades, have been deeply rooted in the hearts of every teacher. In order to teach well, teachers carefully prepare lessons and study teaching materials in advance. Teachers in many schools adopt the form of collective lesson preparation to carefully study and repeatedly discuss teaching materials. In order to improve students' ability to comprehensively use knowledge, mathematics, physics, and chemistry teachers in many schools also jointly prepare lessons, study mutual division of labor and cooperation. In order to better play the leading role of teachers, party committees and education leadership departments at all levels attach great importance to the in-service improvement of teachers. At present, a network of teachers' spare-time in-service training has been formed throughout the province. Provincial, prefectural, municipal, and county levels have established teachers' spare-time in-service training institutions, and ordinary secondary school teachers on the job who need to be trained and improved have basically been organized. The forms of teacher training are flexible and diverse, including face-to-face instruction, correspondence courses, lesson preparation research, special lectures, experimental demonstrations, and production internships. Leaders in various places have strengthened political and ideological work for teachers on the one hand, and paid attention to providing guarantees in terms of time on the other. In addition to off-campus in-service training, teachers' improvement also lies in on-campus improvement. The forms of on-campus improvement include collective lesson preparation, mutual listening to lessons, mutual teaching and learning, and advance lesson preparation. On-campus improvement can make full use of fragmented time, and thus has an important role in improving teachers' teaching level. Through long-term efforts, teachers' teaching level has been greatly improved. Guan Changquan, head of the physics teaching and research group of Nanjing No. 1 Middle School, was originally a graduate of the school's senior high school. He started teaching junior high school physics, and while teaching, he improved. Now he teaches senior high school physics and is welcomed by students. It is easy to see examples of such improvements.

    The continuous improvement of the teaching quality of ordinary secondary schools in Jiangsu Province also lies in the continuous increase in the proportion of children of workers and peasants among students. In 1953, children of workers and peasants accounted for 58.5% of the new students enrolled in ordinary secondary schools throughout the province. In 1957, the proportion of children of workers and peasants among new students rose to 68.7%, and in 1958 it rose to 80.1%, and this year it has risen to 81.4%. Children of workers and peasants generally have clear learning goals and a high degree of learning enthusiasm and consciousness. In addition, the provincial education department regularly holds professional conferences, organizes experience exchanges, compiles teaching reference materials, and compiles supplementary teaching materials, which all have a certain role in promoting the improvement of teaching quality in ordinary secondary schools.

　　增强领导力量  贯彻教育方针  妥善安排教学  提高教师水平
    江苏普通中学教学质量不断提高
    本报讯　记者鲍春光报道：江苏省各级党委和教育部门，根据党的教育方针采取有效措施，从各方面保证提高普通中学的教学质量，已经取得了良好的效果。
    江苏省现有普通中学一千六百多所，学生六十九万多人，和1949年相比，学校增加近四倍，学生增加六倍多。各级党委和教育部门在提高普通中学教学质量方面，非常重视加强普通中学的领导力量。从1955年以来，各级党委已经调了县委委员、县长、文教科局长和机关干部六百多人到普通中学去做领导工作。目前，全省完全中学的校长大都由相当于县委书记、委员、地委部长级水平的干部担任。除此以外，许多地区还提拔了一些政治坚强、熟悉业务的老教师担任学校的领导工作。各个学校政治和业务领导力量的加强，是党的教育方针的坚决贯彻和教学质量的不断提高的先决条件。
    从去年春季开展勤工俭学以来，各地普通中学因地制宜、就地取材，搞生产劳动，到中央关于教育工作的指示公布以后，更是全面地贯彻了教育与劳动生产相结合，办起了七百多个工厂，开辟了大量农场，基本上建立了劳动基地。各个学校都把生产劳动排入了正式课程，使生产劳动制度化、经常化，并与教学相结合。教学与生产劳动结合以后，教师教学的内容丰富了。南京有些教师到无线电厂亲手装配收音机以后，给学生再讲电波传动等知识时，就讲得有声有色，很受学生欢迎。教学与生产劳动结合以后，学生对于知识的掌握牢固了，解决实际问题的能力也增强了。如南京市九中因为生产劳动进行得很好，学生学习成绩也有显著提高。以该校初三乙班为例：1958年下学期成绩与上学期比较，物理八十分以上的学生由二十五人上升到四十二人，没有了不及格的。其它如语文、代数、几何、化学等学科的成绩也有显著上升。
    普通中学教学质量的不断提高，还决定于各级领导对于教学工作加强领导和安排。去年中央提出教育方针以来，省委就把坚决贯彻这一方针作为领导教育工作最中心的任务。为了正确贯彻执行这一方针，省委曾经在全省宣传、文教工作会议上，一方面批判了“劳动代替教学”、“劳动就是教学”等错误思想；另一方面批判了“要搞好教学就不能搞好劳动生产”、“劳动生产影响教学”的资产阶级教育思想。今年春季，根据中央指示，省委又明确指出提高教育质量，应当是德育、智育、体育三方面全面地提高。至于全日制学校，则应该特别注意提高教学质量，要求全日制学校把提高教学质量当作最主要的、经常性的中心工作。今年以来，大部分地、市、县都组织了教育质量大检查，许多学校也自己组织了各种形式的教学质量检查，围绕提高教学质量来改进学校的一切工作。为了提高教学质量，省里还强调学校领导干部必须亲自教课，从教学实践中摸索经验来领导教学。目前，全省普通中学的领导干部大部分兼教了课，少数教课还有困难的也正在为教课积极准备条件。许多地区的文教领导部门配备了熟悉教学业务的干部，来加强对所属学校教学工作的领导。教育领导部门对于各门功课的教学领导，采取重点与一般相结合的办法。从省到地、市、县的教育部门，都强调抓语文、数学、物理、化学等主要学科的教学。为了提高语文教学质量，省教育厅经常总结语文教学经验，向全省普通中学提出切实可行的语文教学改进意见。在各门课教学方面，又特别强调基本训练。例如语文教学，规定了一系列具体的要求。
    江苏省提高普通中学教学质量最根本的措施，还在于提高教师的政治业务水平，更好地发挥教师的主导作用。全省普通中学教师，经过历次政治运动教育，政治思想觉悟有了提高。反右派以前，全省普通中学教师里的党团员占25.9％，目前已上升到36.9％。目前全省师生已经在党的领导下建立起新的师生关系。教育厅提出的教师要认真备课、认真讲课、认真辅导、认真批改作业和认真考查学生成绩的“五认真”已经深入每个教师心中。教师们为了讲好课，事先认真备课、钻研教材。很多学校教师采用集体备课的形式对教材仔细研究、反复讨论。为了提高学生综合利用知识的能力，不少学校里的数学、物理、化学教师还联合备课，研究相互分工和配合。为了更好地发挥教师的主导作用，各级党委和教育领导部门非常重视教师的进修提高工作。目前全省已经形成教师业余进修网，省、地、市、县都建立了教师业余进修机构，凡需要培养提高的普通中学在职教师，已经基本上组织起来。教师进修的形式是灵活多样的，有面授、函授，还有备课研究、专题讲座、实验演示和生产实习等。各地领导一方面对教师加强政治思想工作，另一方面注意从时间上给予保证。教师除了校外进修以外，更重要的还在于校内提高。校内提高的形式，有集体备课、相互听课、互教互学、提前备课等形式。校内提高可以充分利用零碎时间，因而对提高教师教学水平有重要作用。教师们经过长期努力，教学水平有了很大提高。南京市一中物理教研组长关长全原是该校高中毕业生，他从初中物理教起，一面教学，一面提高，现在教高三物理了，并且受到学生欢迎。像这样提高的例子，很容易看到。
    江苏省普通中学教学质量不断提高，还在于学生中工农子弟的比重不断上升。1953年全省普通中学所招的新生中，工农子弟占58.5％，1957年新生中工农子弟比重上升到68.7％，1958年又升到80.1％，今年更上升到81.4％。工农子弟一般的都具有明确的学习目的，以及高度的学习积极性和自觉性。此外，像省里教育部门经常召开专业会议、组织经验交流、编写教学参考资料、编写补充教材等等，对于普通中学教学质量的提高，都有一定的推动作用。
