Opening the Treasure Trove of Pig Feed

    The method of solving the pig feed problem by the Yuejin Commune in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, lies in self-reliance. Can pig feed be solved through self-reliance? This question was originally beyond doubt. However, some people in the Yuejin Commune used to think: "There's no way." There are people with similar understandings in other places. A place like Yuejin Commune, which was "generally acknowledged" as having no source of pig feed, went from breaking the "no way" mindset to coming up with solutions, and as a result, made more than 150 kinds of feed. The raw materials they used were agricultural by-products, wild vegetables, and wild grasses, which are inexhaustible, abundant, and readily available. These things are here, and other places should have them as well, and may even have more and better things. From this, it can be seen that "there's no way to solve the feed problem" is not a practical problem, but a problem of thinking.
    The fact that the Yuejin Commune has opened up sources of pig feed also illustrates a problem: it is impossible without a persistent and tireless spirit of hard work and dedication. In the process of experimenting with processing pig feed, they experienced countless failures, encountered some criticism, and even the people undertaking the experiments lost confidence. However, with the encouragement and support of the commune party committee, they finally opened the treasure trove of pig feed.

    打开猪饲料的宝库
    山西太谷县跃进公社解决猪饲料的方法，贵在自力更生。能不能自力更生解决猪饲料呢？这个问题本来是无可怀疑的。但是跃进公社过去有人认为：“没办法。”其它地方也有类似认识的人。像跃进公社这样一个被“公认”为没有猪饲料来源的地方，经过破“没办法”到想出办法，结果制成了一百五十多种饲料。他们所利用的原料都是农作物副产品、野菜、野草，是取之不尽、用之有余、垂手可得的东西。这些东西这里有，其它地方也应有尽有，而且可能还有更多更好的东西。由此可见，“没办法解决饲料”，不是个实际问题，而是个思想问题。
    跃进公社开辟猪饲料来源的事实还说明一个问题，没有一股顽强不息的干劲和钻劲是不行的。他们在试验加工猪饲料过程中，不计其数的失败，遭到一些非难，甚至承担试验的人信心也不大了。但是在公社党委的鼓励和支持下，他们终于打开了猪饲料的宝库。
