    Cutting Bamboo Requires Leaving Seedlings
    In the past two years, due to the needs of various construction projects, more bamboo has been used. However, some places only focus on felling without paying attention to leaving seedlings. For example, in Yongfeng Brigade of Jiaoshan Commune, Hengyang County, Hunan Province, the bamboo felling in the past two years has been guided by people who do not understand bamboo forest management techniques. They indiscriminately cut bamboo regardless of the density of the bamboo forest, only choosing what is convenient and along the way, and they do not leave mother bamboo, which seriously affects the reproduction of bamboo.
    According to the experience of bamboo farmers, bamboo with dense leaves that are dark green or black are the mother bamboo that will produce shoots in the second year and should not be felled. Even if only one or two mother bamboo are left on a mountain, they can produce shoots and seedlings, gradually propagating into a bamboo forest.
    It is suggested that all localities pay attention to leaving seedlings when cutting bamboo.

    砍竹要留种
    这两年由于各项建设的需要，用竹子多了。可是有些地方只顾砍伐，而不注意留种。像湖南衡阳县角山公社永丰大队这两年来采伐竹子，就是由不懂得竹山管理技术的人指导砍伐的，他们不管竹林稀密，只拣顺手顺路的砍，也不留母竹，严重地影响了竹子的繁殖。
    根据竹农的经验，凡是竹叶浓密发青黑色的，就是第二年生笋的母竹，不应该砍伐；一片山上哪怕只留一两根母竹，也可以生笋开苗，慢慢繁殖成竹林。
    建议各地砍竹子时，一定要注意留种。
