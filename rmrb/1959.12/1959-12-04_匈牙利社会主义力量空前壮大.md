Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 2nd - The Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party continued on the afternoon of December 2nd. Feher, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party, delivered a speech on agricultural issues at the meeting. Feher said that although agricultural production, especially animal husbandry, has greatly developed in the past two or three years, it still cannot meet the needs of the national economy for agriculture. Therefore, the directives of the second five-year plan stipulate that agricultural production should increase by 30% to 32% compared with the average output of 1954-1958. This task will be accomplished through the healthy development of the cooperative movement and the adoption of new scientific and technological achievements.
    Feher said that the main task in the development of the cooperative movement is to consolidate the existing cooperatives. At present, the socialist component in agriculture is constantly growing, and this winter it will account for a large proportion of the entire agriculture. The large-scale development and rapid consolidation of the cooperative movement this year is unprecedented in the history of the cooperative movement in the past decade.
    Feher pointed out that the large-scale development of cooperative production requires good use of the cooperative's own material strength, increasing the number of publicly owned livestock, purchasing some agricultural machinery, and developing water conservancy. By 1965, the national irrigated area will be more than double the current area. He emphasized that the above tasks should be completed by relying on the farmers' own strength.
    Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, said in his speech at the conference that the Socialist Workers' Party is warmly supported and loved by the people of the country. Under the leadership of the Party, Hungary has achieved great development in political, economic, and cultural fields. Dobi strongly condemned the United States for manipulating the United Nations again to raise the so-called "Hungarian issue," and pointed out that this behavior is a provocation to the Hungarian people. He said that Hungary's problems are the Hungarian people's own business and do not need to be discussed by the United Nations. The clamor of imperialism cannot affect the Hungarian people in the slightest. The Hungarian people will always decide their own problems.
    Brujo, member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Secretary-General of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that the labor competition launched across the country this year fully demonstrates the enthusiasm and consciousness of the broad masses in building socialism. In the future, labor competitions must be better organized and led. He said that it is necessary to continuously improve the political consciousness of the working people in the process of socialist construction. Existing experience has proved that socialist labor teams can not only promote production and improve the technical level of employees, but also help improve the socialist consciousness of employees.
    Also speaking at the afternoon meeting on the 2nd were: Gabor, representative of Budapest, Gostony, First Secretary of the Vosz State Party Committee, Petofi, representative of Bács-Kiskun State, and others.
    At the afternoon meeting on the 2nd, representatives of many fraternal parties also delivered speeches one after another.
    Staikov, head the delegation of the Bulgarian Communist Party and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, said in his speech that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has always unswervingly defended Marxism-Leninism. The wounds left by the 1956 counter-revolutionary events have been healed, and the implementation of the three-year plan has made a major step forward in the development of Hungary's national economy and the consolidation of the people's regime. The Bulgarian people are sincerely happy for the great achievements made by their friends.
    Lehmann, the German Communist Party representative and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, addressed the conference, saying that with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party led the people of the country to crush the 1956 counter-revolutionary riots, which was a great contribution to defending world peace. Lehmann also said that the two world wars and the revolutionary struggles of the Hungarian and German workers' movements show that the German imperialists and militarists are the mortal enemies of the people of Germany and Hungary. They once participated in plotting the counter-revolutionary riots against Hungary, and they have banned the activities of the German Communist Party with the support of the Adenauer government. We will make every effort in the future to enable the working class to take concerted action to stop German militarism and adventurism so that the land of Germany will no longer be a breeding ground for new wars.
    Kabo, head of the delegation of the Albanian Labor Party, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, and Secretary of the Secretariat, said in his speech that the brilliant achievements Hungary has made in various fields in the past three years vividly confirm that the road taken by the Socialist Workers' Party is the correct Marxist-Leninist road. Only the past ruling class, imperialists, and modern revisionists will resent hearing these achievements. Kabo said that imperialists and enemies of socialism will not give up their aggression against us. But no matter what conspiracies imperialists and their lackeys engage in against socialist countries and the communist movement, they will suffer a shameful defeat.
    Park Jung-ae, head of the delegation of the Korean Labor Party and Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, said in her speech that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the people of the country have been tempered and tested in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies and defended the achievements of the revolution, which has greatly promoted the consolidation of the socialist camp and world peace. Park Jung-ae said that the achievements made by the Korean people in economic construction will become a strong material foundation for the unification of the entire Korea.
    John Mahon, representative of the British Communist Party and member of the British Communist Party's Political Committee, said that the British people need peace, but the re-elected parliament still expressed its loyalty to the North Atlantic Group—the Suicide Club. The Conservative Party's actual actions are too far from its verbal shouts for peace. There is a saying in English: "Watch their hands, don't just look at their mouths."
    Tsend, head of the delegation of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, member of the Central Political Bureau, and Second Secretary of the Secretariat, said in his speech that during October and November 1956, the Hungarian people experienced a severe test. The shameful failure of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy and the crushing of the Nagy traitorous group were a fatal blow to imperialism and international revisionism.
    Hoang Van Hoan, head of the delegation of the Vietnamese Labor Party and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, read out the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party at the conference. The congratulatory letter said that the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese people warmly congratulate the Hungarian people on the great victories they have achieved in recent years, and thank the Hungarian Party, government, and people for their support for the Vietnamese people's socialist construction and efforts to peacefully reunify the motherland.
    The speeches of the representatives of the fraternal parties were warmly welcomed by the conference.
    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 3rd - The Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party continued on the morning of December 3rd.
    At the beginning of the meeting, the Executive Chairman, Benke Valeria, read out many congratulatory messages sent to the Congress by fraternal parties.
    When Muhammad Hussein Abu Alis, head of the delegation of the Iraqi Communist Party, addressed the Congress, he pointed out that imperialism and domestic reactionaries colluded and never stopped conspiring to overthrow the Iraqi Republic after the victory of the Iraqi revolution.
    He said that the strength of the Iraqi people is stronger than that of the enemy. The Iraqi Communist Party is uniting the progressive forces of the country, mobilizing the masses, and supporting the Kassem government. We believe that our people will win victory in the struggle to defend an independent, anti-imperialist, peace-loving republic.
    Eladio Ladislaus Carvajal, representative of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, said in his congratulatory speech that the victory of the Cuban revolution was a heavy blow to imperialism. U.S. imperialism has consistently supported the reactionary forces in Cuba and carried out sabotage activities against independent Cuba.
    Antonio Mije, representative of the Spanish Communist Party and member of the Central Political Bureau, pointed out in his congratulatory speech that the Spanish Communist Party has become increasingly strong in arduous struggles, and its influence and prestige among the masses have also increased.
    Speaking of U.S. imperialism's support for the Franco regime, he said that U.S. imperialism provided large loans to the Franco government in order to maintain its aggressive military bases established on Spanish territory. He concluded by saying that the Spanish people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are preparing to engage in new and greater battles.
    Rasheed, representative of the Algerian Communist Party, said in his speech that the Algerian people should handle the affairs of Algeria themselves. We are not afraid of any difficulties and sacrifices, and we will resolutely carry the struggle to the end.
    Also giving congratulatory speeches at today's meeting were representatives of fraternal parties from Belgium, Finland, Denmark, and Greece.
    The speeches of the representatives of the fraternal parties were warmly welcomed.
    At the morning meeting, Béla Biszku, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of the Interior, spoke on the issue of strengthening the people's democratic system. He said that our people's democratic system and all socialist forces have developed and grown, and the enemies of the people's regime have suffered serious defeats and have been isolated.
    Biszku pointed out that the suppression of the 1956 counter-revolutionary riots and the thorough struggle led by the Party against the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat and the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In order to make the proletarian regime forever strong and consolidated and not subject to enemy invasion, it is necessary to follow the teachings of Marx and Lenin and do everything possible to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    Biszku emphasized that the achievements we have been able to achieve in the past three years are due to the unity and increasingly strengthened mutual trust between the Party and the people, and especially to the will and creative labor of the people of the country. The increasingly high creative enthusiasm and initiative shown by the masses of the people in accelerating socialist construction are the characteristics of the Party-mass relationship today, the strength of our people's democratic system, and the guarantee for future achievements.
    Biszku said that now the imperialists are using their usual despicable means to raise the so-called "Hungarian issue" against us. They organized an attack on our people's regime, forcing us to take strict measures.
    Biszku pointed out that the suppression of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots not only shattered the enemy's despicable conspiracy to eliminate socialist Hungary, but also broke their war plan to attack other socialist countries.
    Biszku said that under the leadership of the Party and with the help of those who are loyal to our system, we have successfully completed the complex task of fighting against counter-revolutionaries. We have detected and arrested those who played a leading role in the preparation and command of the counter-revolutionary riots, and have handed them over to the judicial organs of the Hungarian People's Republic so that they can be duly punished. For those who were deceived and involved in the incident but are now able to work conscientiously and fight for the consolidation of the people's system, we have adopted a policy of education and persuasion based on their class status and their repentance after the counter-revolutionary incident.
    Due to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Hungarian bourgeoisie, the landlord class, and the agents of the West have suffered a painful defeat, so they began to shout "too strict." They believe that the massacre of Communist Party members and other patriots is humanitarian, while the people's regime's punishment of thugs and murderers in accordance with the law is an act of terror. This is their morality.
    Biszku said that so far more than 40,000 Hungarian exiles have returned from the West. In the West, they saw only the freedom of unemployment and hunger, the freedom of crime and prostitution, and there, democracy and the rule of law belong to the rich. Biszku emphasized that as long as those influential groups that pursue a "cold war" policy do not abandon their attempts to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs, as long as they still attempt to restore the past ruling class and send agents or spies to our country to organize secret service agencies and carry out conspiracy sabotage activities, then we cannot relax our vigilance against domestic and foreign enemies. Even today, we see that there are imperialist secret service organizations in West Germany, the United States, Austria, and other places carrying out sabotage activities against our country. In the United States, such subversive activities have been raised to the level of "legislation." With the approval of Congress, the United States spends as much as 100 million U.S. dollars on this aspect every year.
    Biszku said that we must teach our internal affairs organs at all levels that only with the active participation and support of the working masses can we successfully suppress the enemy and defend the state regime. After the counter-revolutionary incident, the class enemy was unable to establish a broader organization. Our sacred obligation is to rely more on the masses under the leadership of the Party. This is our guarantee for achieving success in the future.

    匈牙利社会主义力量空前壮大
    费赫尔在党代会上说将继续发展农业合作化　道比谴责美国操纵联合国提出“匈牙利问题”
    布鲁乔说必须不断地提高劳动人民的政治觉悟　比斯库强调依靠群众尽力加强无产阶级专政
    各国兄弟党代表向大会致贺词
    据新华社布达佩斯2日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会2日下午继续举行。社会主义工人党中央政治局委员费赫尔在会上作了关于农业问题的发言。费赫尔说，虽然最近两三年来，农业生产，特别是畜牧业生产有了很大的发展，但是仍然赶不上国民经济对农业的需要，因此在第二个五年计划的指示中规定，农业生产要比1954—1958年的平均产量提高30％到32％。这个任务将通过合作化运动的健康发展和采用新的科学技术成就来完成。
    费赫尔说，目前在合作化运动的发展中主要任务是巩固现有的合作社。目前，农业中的社会主义成分正在不断增长，今年冬季它将在整个农业中占很大比重。今年合作化运动的大规模发展和迅速巩固是十年来合作化运动史上从未出现过的。
    费赫尔指出，合作社生产的大规模发展需要很好地利用合作社自己的物质力量，增加公有牲畜的头数，自购一部分农业机器和兴修水利。到1965年全国灌溉面积将比目前增加一倍以上。他强调应该依靠农民自己的力量来完成上述任务。
    匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比在大会发言说，社会主义工人党受到全国人民的热烈拥护和爱戴。在党的领导下，匈牙利已在政治、经济和文化等方面获得了巨大的发展。道比强烈谴责美国又操纵联合国提出所谓“匈牙利问题”，并指出这种行为是对匈牙利人民的挑衅。他说，匈牙利的问题是匈牙利人民自己的事，用不着联合国来讨论。帝国主义的叫嚣一点也不能影响匈牙利人民。匈牙利人民永远会自己决定自己的问题。    社会主义工人党中央委员、匈牙利工会中央理事会总书记布鲁乔在发言中指出，今年全国掀起的劳动竞赛充分显示了广大群众建设社会主义的热情和自觉性。今后必须更好地组织和领导劳动竞赛。他说，必须在社会主义建设过程中不断提高劳动人民的政治觉悟。已有的经验证明，社会主义劳动队不仅能促进生产和提高职工的技术水平，而且有助于提高职工的社会主义觉悟。
    在2日下午会议上发言的还有：布达佩斯代表加博尔，沃什州党委会第一书记戈斯托尼、巴奇—基什孔州代表佩托菲等。
    在2日下午会议上，还有很多兄弟党的代表先后致了词。
    保加利亚共产党代表团团长、保共中央政治局委员斯塔伊科夫在致词时说，匈牙利社会主义工人党始终不渝地捍卫了马克思列宁主义。1956年反革命事件所遗留下来的创伤被医治好了，三年计划的执行使匈牙利国民经济的发展和人民政权的巩固向前迈进了一大步。保加利亚人民衷心地为自己的朋友所取得的伟大成绩而高兴。
    德国共产党代表、德共中央第一书记雷曼向大会致词说，在苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国的援助下，匈牙利社会主义工人党领导全国人民粉碎了1956年的反革命暴乱，这是对保卫世界和平的巨大贡献。雷曼还说，两次世界大战和匈德两国工人运动的革命斗争说明：德国帝国主义者和军国主义者是德匈两国人民的死敌，他们曾经参与策划了反对匈牙利的反革命暴乱，他们又在阿登纳政府支持下禁止了德国共产党的活动。我们今后将尽最大努力使工人阶级采取一致行动，制止德国的军国主义和冒险主义，使德国的土地不再成为新战争的策源地。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团团长、劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记卡博在致词时说，三年来匈牙利在各方面已取得的辉煌成就活生生地证实了社会主义工人党所走的是正确的马克思列宁主义的道路。只有过去的统治阶级、帝国主义和现代修正主义者听到这些成绩才会愤恨。卡博说，帝国主义者和社会主义的敌人不会放弃对我们的侵略。但不管帝国主义及其走狗们搞什么阴谋来反对社会主义国家和共产主义运动，他们都将遭到可耻的失败。
    朝鲜劳动党代表团长、劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱致词时说，匈牙利社会主义工人党和全国人民在同国内外敌人的斗争中经受了锻炼和考验，保卫了革命的成果，这在很大程度上促进了社会主义阵营的巩固和世界和平。朴正爱说，朝鲜人民在经济建设方面所取得的成就将成为整个朝鲜统一的强大物质基础。
    英国共产党代表、英共政治委员会委员约翰·马洪说，英国人民需要和平，但重新选出来的议会仍然表示忠于北大西洋集团——自杀俱乐部。保守党的实际行动同它口头叫喊的和平口号之间距离太远。英国有句成语：“要注意他们的手，不要只看他们的嘴”。
    蒙古人民革命党代表团团长、中央政治局委员、书记处第二书记曾德在致词时说，在1956年10月到11月期间，匈牙利人民经历了严重的考验。反动派的阴谋的可耻失败和纳吉卖国集团的被粉碎对帝国主义和国际修正主义是一个致命的打击。
    越南劳动党代表团团长、劳动党中央政治局委员黄文欢在大会上宣读了越南劳动党中央的贺信。贺信说，越南劳动党和越南人民热烈祝贺匈牙利人民最近几年来所取得的巨大胜利，并感谢匈牙利党、政府和人民对越南人民的社会主义建设和和平统一祖国的努力的支持。
    各兄弟党代表的发言受到了大会的热烈欢迎。
    据新华社布达佩斯3日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会3日上午继续举行。
    会议开始时，执行主席本克·瓦莱丽亚宣读了许多兄弟党致代表大会的贺电。
    伊拉克共产党代表团团长穆罕默德·侯赛因·阿布·阿利斯向大会致祝词时指出，帝国主义和国内反动派勾结起来，在伊拉克革命胜利后，一天也没有停止推翻伊拉克共和国的阴谋活动。
    他说，伊拉克人民的力量比敌人强大。伊拉克共产党正在团结全国的进步力量，发动群众，支持卡塞姆政府。我们相信，我国人民将在捍卫独立的、反帝的、爱好和平的共和国的斗争中取得胜利。
    古巴人民社会党代表埃拉迪奥·拉迪斯劳·卡瓦哈耳在致祝词时说，古巴革命的胜利对帝国主义是一个沉重的打击。美帝国主义一贯支持古巴的反动势力，对获得独立的古巴进行破坏活动。
    西班牙共产党代表、中央政治局委员安东尼奥·米赫在致祝词中指出，西班牙共产党在艰苦的斗争中锻炼得日益坚强，在群众中的影响和威信也日益增长。
    他在谈到美帝国主义支持佛朗哥政权时说，美帝国主义对佛朗哥政府提供大笔贷款，是为了保持它在西班牙的领土上建立的侵略性的军事基地。他最后说，西班牙人民正在共产党的领导下，准备投入新的、更大的战斗。
    阿尔及利亚共产党代表拉希德在致词时说，阿尔及利亚的事，要由阿尔及利亚人民自己处理。我们不怕任何困难和牺牲，我们将坚决地把斗争进行到底。
    在今天会议上致祝词的还有比利时、芬兰、丹麦和希腊等兄弟党的代表
    各兄弟党代表的致词，受到了热烈的欢迎。
    在上午会议上匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、内务部长比斯库·贝洛就加强人民民主制度问题发了言。他说，我国的人民民主制度和一切社会主义力量发展壮大了，人民政权的敌人遭到了严重的失败，并已被孤立起来了。
    比斯库指出，1956年反革命暴乱的平息，以及党领导的、对残余反革命力量所进行的彻底斗争，巩固了无产阶级专政和无产阶级专政的国家。为了使无产阶级政权永远坚强巩固，不受敌人的侵犯，必须遵照马克思列宁的教导，尽一切力量，加强无产阶级专政。
    比斯库强调指出，我们在过去三年中之所以能够取得成就，应归功于党和人民之间的团结和日益加强的相互信任，特别是应归功于全国人民的意志力和创造性的劳动。人民群众在加速社会主义建设中表现的日益高涨的创造热情和积极性，是今天党群关系的特点，是我国人民民主制度的力量，是今后取得成绩的保证。
    比斯库说，现在帝国主义者又以其所惯用的卑鄙手段提出所谓
  “匈牙利问题”来反对我们，他们组织了对我国人民政权的进攻，迫使我们采取严厉的措施。
    比斯库指出，匈牙利反革命暴乱之被平息，不仅粉碎了敌人消灭社会主义匈牙利的卑鄙阴谋，而且也打破了他们进攻其他社会主义国家的战争计划。
    比斯库说，在党的领导下，在忠实于我国制度的人士的帮助下，我们成功地完成了对反革命分子进行斗争的复杂任务。我们侦察逮捕了那些在准备、指挥反革命暴乱过程中起过领导作用的分子，并已把他们转交给匈牙利人民共和国的司法机关，以便让他们受到应有的惩罚。对那些因受骗而被卷入事件，但今天已能认真工作并为巩固人民制度而斗争的人，我们根据他们的阶级地位及其在反革命事件后的悔悟表现采取了教育与说服的政策。
    由于对反革命分子的镇压，使匈牙利的资产阶级、地主阶级和西方的代理人遭到了惨痛的失败，因此他们就开始大喊“太严厉了”。他们认为屠杀共产党员和其他爱国人士是人道主义，而人民政权按照法律惩治暴徒和凶手却是恐怖行为，这就是他们的道德。
    比斯库说，到目前为止已有四万多匈牙利流亡者从西方回来了，他们在西方看到那里只有失业和饥饿的自由，犯罪与卖淫的自由，那里的民主和法权是属于富人的。比斯库着重指出，只要那些执行“冷战”政策的、还有相当影响的集团不放弃干涉匈牙利内政的企图，只要他们还企图使过去的统治阶级复辟，派遣特务或间谍到我国来组织特务机关，进行阴谋捣乱活动，那么，我们就不能放松对国内外敌人的警惕性，一直到今天为止，我们还看到西德、美国、奥地利以及其它地方都有帝国主义特务组织对我国进行破坏活动。而在美国，竟把这种颠复破坏的活动提高到“立法”的高度。美国在国会的批准下每年用在这方面的款项竟达一亿美元。
    比斯库说，我们要教导我们的各级内务机关，只有在劳动群众积极参加和支持的情况下，我们才能成功地镇压敌人和保卫国家政权。在反革命事件后，阶级敌人已无法建立某种较广泛的组织。我们的神圣义务是：在党的领导下更好地依靠群众。这在今后是我们取得成就的保证。
