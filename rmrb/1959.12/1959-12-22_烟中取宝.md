Extracting Treasure from Smoke

The news that Yongshan Commune in Leping County is extracting ammonia from the smoke of "three kilns and one stove" to produce fertilizer is very encouraging!

This news inspires us that as long as this method is promoted, other regions and communes can also extract ammonia from the smoke of "three kilns and one stove." This news also inspires us that as long as appropriate methods are devised, we can not only extract ammonia from the smoke of "three kilns and one stove," but also utilize all the smoke from burning coal and firewood in rural areas, cities, and factories.

Ammonia is a nitrogenous fertilizer, and its effect on increasing crop production is very significant. Using indigenous methods to extract ammonia from waste smoke is an effective, economical, and rapid way to solve the current shortage of nitrogen fertilizer.

　　烟中取宝
    乐平县涌山公社从“三窑一灶”烟中取氨制化肥的消息，很振奋人心！
    这条消息启示我们，只要把这个办法推广开，其它地区和公社也可以从“三窑一灶”的烟中取氨。这条消息还启示我们，只要想出适当的办法，不仅可以从“三窑一灶”的烟取氨，而且可以把农村、城市和工厂一切烧煤、烧柴的烟都利用起来。
    氨是一种氮素肥料，对农作物增产的作用十分显著。用土办法从废烟中取氨，是解决目前氮肥不足的一个多快好省的有效办法。
