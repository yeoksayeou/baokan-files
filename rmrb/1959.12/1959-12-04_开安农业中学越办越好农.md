Kai'an Agricultural Middle School in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, under the direct leadership of the county Party committee and the commune Party committee, conscientiously implements the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, it has brought into play the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune, relied on the strong support of the broad masses, adhered to the principle of part-work and part-study, and running schools diligently and thriftily. Teachers and students are full of energy, enthusiasm, and are not afraid of difficulties, and work hard. Therefore, it has rapidly embarked on a path of consolidation and development. In the past year or so, it has achieved a triple harvest in ideology, study, and production, with fruitful results. The masses praised it, and the Party committee, parents, the masses, students, and teachers are all satisfied; it also educated those who had doubts about the future of agricultural middle schools. No one thinks that agricultural middle schools are "born wrong and will not live long" anymore. The fact that agricultural middle schools are getting better and better shows the vigorous vitality of this new type of school.

When this school was first established, it had only two classes with seventy-two students. Now it has developed into six classes with more than two hundred and sixty students, and the average daily attendance rate is over 98%. Teachers and students treat the school as their home and love the school as their home. It simply cannot be broken up. According to the nature of agricultural middle schools, the school properly arranges teaching and production labor time to ensure that study and production are not neglected and plans are completed on time. Teachers get up early and work late, work tirelessly, are conscientious and responsible, and enthusiastically teach; students study diligently and work hard, and the quality of teaching has caught up with ordinary middle schools. In October, the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee conducted a comparative test on one class each of the second grade students of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School and Nong'an No. 3 Middle School. As a result, the scores of the two schools in Chinese language were similar, while the mathematics scores of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School were much higher than those of No. 3 Middle School.

In terms of production, the school has established a farm with twenty-five hectares of land and small-scale woodworking factories, indigenous fertilizer factories, and weaving factories. It raises six horses, sixteen head of cattle, twenty pigs, and eight boxes of bees. It has two rubber-wheeled carts, two steel cart axles, and other production tools. The industrial, agricultural, and sideline production, coupled with seasonal other production labor, the production base is sufficient to accommodate all students in labor. The production base is becoming more and more consolidated, and more and more production experience is being accumulated. This year, the first shot in agricultural production has been fired. Due to the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, both experimental fields, basic fields, and general fields have achieved bumper harvests. It can produce 55,400 catties of grain and 133,000 catties of vegetables for the country. And it achieved high yields on 67 mu of cultivated land, producing a total of 46,900 catties of grain, with an average yield of 700 catties per mu, exceeding the agricultural development program target.

Due to the implementation of the production policy of focusing on agriculture, resolutely doing a good job in experimental fields, high-yield and bumper harvests, vigorously developing diversified operations, and implementing simultaneous agricultural and sideline production, economic income is also considerable. As of October this year, the income has reached 21,541 yuan. The total value of production for the whole year is expected to reach 31,480 yuan. Students do not spend money to study, and the school buildings have been expanded, and teaching supplies and recreational and sports activities supplies have been added, realizing financial self-sufficiency. This reduces the burden on the commune and parents, ensures that students study more attentively, and the school is more consolidated.

The rapid growth of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School has not been smooth sailing. Teachers and students have jointly overcome one difficulty after another on the road of advancement. The process of overcoming various difficulties has been a profound test for teachers and students. In fact, they did not take difficulties into consideration. If there were no classrooms, they would have classes in the labor field; if there was no dining hall, they would eat in the open air. The more difficult days have passed, and now there are classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls, and they are gradually being improved. Teachers and students look forward and backward, and always feel that the days of agricultural middle schools are getting better and better.

The consolidation and improvement of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School is a victory for the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and a victory for the policy of developing education with "walking on two legs." The experience of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School getting better and better is:

Adhere to part-work and part-study, improve teaching quality

The leaders and teachers of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School deeply realize that whether students can learn knowledge is the most important issue for students and parents, and it is also the fundamental issue for consolidating and improving agricultural middle schools. From the day it was founded, the school has always put improving teaching quality in the first place, and taking teaching to catch up with ordinary middle schools as the direction of hard work in teaching and learning. And adhere to part-work and part-study, generally taking the half-day system of half-day study and half-day labor as the main form. During busy production seasons, an every-other-day system is adopted. When production is not busy, a full-day system is sometimes adopted. Insist on three hours of self-study every morning and evening, and implement bi-weekly rest. The school has compiled three types of timetables: full-day (six lessons per day), every-other-day (eight lessons per day), and half-day (four lessons per day) to adapt to the flexible arrangement of teaching and productive labor needs, ensuring that teachers can teach in an orderly manner and complete teaching plans on time, no matter what form of teaching is adopted.

Students learn well, which is closely related to teachers teaching well. Over the past year or so, Kai'an Agricultural Middle School has paid attention to inspiring teachers to play a leading role and strive to improve their teaching level. The school is linked with Nong'an No. 3 Middle School, organizes teachers to go to No. 3 Middle School to observe classes, and when they encounter difficult problems in teaching, they study together with the teachers of No. 3 Middle School, and humbly learn from the teachers of No. 3 Middle School. At the same time, pay attention to students' ability to accept and try to help students with poor academic performance to improve the quality of learning. Teaching also implements the principle of linking theory with practice. If there are any ideological problems among students, teachers will solve them through political class teaching in a timely manner. Teach whatever is needed in agricultural technology, apply what is learned immediately after learning, flexibly handle teaching materials, move forward or backward according to the needs of the agricultural season, supplement what is not in the books, and delete what is not suitable for local application in the textbooks. And conduct on-site teaching to consolidate the knowledge students have learned in books and expand students' knowledge field.

The school has organized extracurricular research groups according to the characteristics and hobbies of students, and established activity groups such as agriculture, horticulture, woodworking, meteorology, pesticides, beekeeping, pig raising, and literary creation. Although these groups have not been established for long, they have all achieved some results. The horticulture group studied pumpkin pollination and vine pressing and topdressing, and each plant bore eight or nine large pumpkins. The pesticide group has researched six kinds of pesticides, and two have been successfully trial-produced. On August 3, a small piece of soybeans developed "greasy insects". They used their own manufactured pesticides to kill the insects, and the efficacy of the medicine reached 100%, and all the "greasy insects" were eliminated. Through this activity, students' interest and enthusiasm for scientific research were cultivated, so that they obtained rich and practical production knowledge and skills.

In order to strengthen the basic training of students' basic knowledge, the school has taken many measures: held speech contests, reading report meetings, story meetings, poetry reading meetings, and homework exhibitions, and added a calligraphy class. Arithmetic homework has increased from six times a week to nine times. These measures have significantly improved students' writing, reading, writing, and language expression abilities.

Do a good job in production and realize financial self-sufficiency

In production, the policy of focusing on agriculture, adhering to doing a good job in agricultural scientific research experiments, high-yield and bumper harvests, developing diversified operations in accordance with local conditions, and implementing simultaneous agricultural and sideline production was implemented.

The school conscientiously implements the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture in production, and includes the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture in the teaching plan of agricultural knowledge. Through classroom teaching, the scientific principles of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture are explained clearly, so that students can ideologically accept the agricultural production knowledge and technology expounded by the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. And an agricultural production plan was formulated according to the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Although the school only planted four hectares of high-yield experimental fields, the entire school's land became the commune's experimental field. From spring to autumn, the commune organized people to visit the agricultural middle school in every important production link, and successively held four on-site meetings in the agricultural middle school to spread the experience of the agricultural middle school, which played a good influence on the local agricultural bumper harvest. Some local conservatives doubted deep plowing and rational close planting, but the agricultural middle school produced 1,500 catties per mu of multi-spiked and high-grain on the deeply plowed land, exceeding the local normal yield per mu by more than 1,000 catties, and exceeding the local highest yield in the same year by 800 catties. Closely planted wheat, with a sowing width of one foot and a row spacing of three inches, had 173 wheat plants per square foot, with wheat as high as four feet and spikes as long as four inches, with an average of 58 to 63 grains per spike, with a yield of 720 catties per mu, exceeding the local highest yield by 300 catties. During the autumn harvest, the commune organized people who doubted deep plowing and close planting to visit the agricultural middle school to open their eyes. Qiu Guodong, an 83-year-old farmer who had always thought that the wheat planted in the agricultural middle school in the spring was too dense and could not grow spikes, was also convinced. He praised the principal and said, "You young people are really capable!" The fact of high-yield and bumper harvest educated the masses and defended the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture.

Over the past year or so of agricultural production, students have received practical education and labor training, learned rich production knowledge and skills, gradually established the thoughts and feelings of working people, and developed interest and enthusiasm for agricultural production. The idea that "farming does not require reading, and people who read cannot farm" has gradually disappeared; at the same time, physical fitness and practical labor ability have been generally enhanced.

In addition, the school also vigorously develops diversified operations to increase income. In terms of handicraft production, woodworking factories, weaving factories, and sewing factories have been established, and livestock, poultry, and bees have been raised. And according to seasonal characteristics, diversified labor such as firewood, grain picking, grass picking, short-distance transportation, and working were carried out in accordance with local conditions and time. Therefore, financial self-sufficiency has been achieved, so that agricultural middle schools can be continuously consolidated and improved.

Rely on the masses, make do with what is available, and run schools diligently and thriftily

Agricultural middle schools are schools run by people's communes. The masses call agricultural middle schools "their own schools" and care for them especially. Kai'an Agricultural Middle School has relied closely on the masses since the day it was founded. Over the past year or so, teachers and students have deeply realized that nothing can be accomplished without the masses. The masses, especially the parents of students and local institutions and enterprises, are really responsive to every request. They are proud to be able to contribute their meager strength to run agricultural middle schools well. Over the past year or so, the masses have donated and lent more than 2,600 large and small teaching, production, and living supplies to agricultural middle schools, helping the school to overcome many difficulties.

The school also experienced the ideas of "comparing good, striving for victory, seeking newness, seeking completeness, seeking extravagance, and emphasizing ostentation." According to the instructions of the Party Committee, through repeated discussion and research, everyone unanimously realized that to run agricultural middle schools well, we must implement the principle of making do with what is available and running schools diligently and thriftily. Over the past year or so, the law of "spending less money, doing more things, and doing things without spending money" has been initially explored, that is: in terms of equipment and supplies, resolutely use substitutes if possible. If it can be borrowed, it will never be bought. In terms of funding expenditure, resolutely do not spend money that can be spent or not. Use the money where it should be used. In terms of school construction, do it yourself if teachers and students can do it, and never hire outsiders. Over the past year or so, about 8,000 yuan has been saved in teaching, production, and school construction. Doing so also cultivates students' qualities of diligence and thrift. The local people praised the teachers and students of the agricultural middle school as "housekeeping experts."

Rely on the leadership of the commune Party committee and adhere to putting politics in command

From the founding of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School to the present, school buildings, teachers, and production labor bases have all been resolved due to the leadership and attention of the commune Party committee. The commune Party committee decided that Li Baoshan, the first secretary, would concurrently serve as the principal of the agricultural middle school, and Ma Zhenhua, the director of the commune, would concurrently serve as the vice-principal. They often went deep into the agricultural middle school to provide specific guidance and assigned more leading cadres and teachers. During the people's communeization, the commune Party committee solved the problem of housing for the agricultural middle school in a unified arrangement, and allocated 18.62 mu of land, a rubber-wheeled cart, and six horses. Another rubber-wheeled cart was allocated in October this year. This created material conditions for the agricultural middle school to achieve production self-sufficiency. In order to run the woodworking factory well, a technician was sent to the agricultural middle school. In addition to timely instructing the direction of production in the agricultural middle school, Secretary Li Baoshan personally helped the agricultural middle school to find ways to produce, increase income, and solve the problem of financial self-sufficiency. The commune secretaries often went to the fields and labored with the students, guiding the students' production labor. In the spring, much of the fertilizer in the agricultural middle school could not be sent to the fields in time, so the commune Party committee sent 30 rubber-wheeled carts to help the agricultural middle school send fertilizer. Rubber-wheeled carts were also sent to help pull crops during the autumn harvest. The commune Party committee, in view of the fact that the agricultural middle school is part-work and part-study, and that it is necessary to improve the quality of teaching and solve the problem of financial self-sufficiency through production labor, tried its best to create favorable conditions for the agricultural middle school to complete its teaching and production plans on time. More importantly, the commune Party committee often publicized the purpose and significance of running agricultural middle schools well and the benefits of agricultural middle schools among cadres and the masses, adhered to putting politics in command, solved the wrong understanding of agricultural middle schools among cadres and the masses, and led and mobilized the masses to run their own schools well - agricultural middle schools. Leading the running of agricultural middle schools well has been included in the work agenda of the Kai'an People's Commune Party Committee. Any difficulties in the agricultural middle school are discussed and resolved. The commune Party committee's strengthening of the leadership of the agricultural middle school is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating and improving agricultural middle schools. The solution to these problems would also be difficult to achieve without the establishment of the people's commune. The better and better running of agricultural middle schools fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune.

    开安农业中学越办越好农
    安县文教局　农安县开安人民公社农业中学
    吉林省农安县开安人民公社农业中学，在县委和公社党委的直接领导下，认真贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，在总路线、大跃进的光辉照耀下，发挥了人民公社无比的优越性，依靠广大群众的大力支持，坚持了半工半读、勤俭办学的原则，教师和学生的干劲足，热情高，不怕困难，艰苦奋斗，因而迅速地走上巩固、发展的道路。一年多来，思想、学习、生产三丰收，硕果累累，群众称赞，做到了党委、家长、群众、学生、教师五满意；同时也教育了对农业中学的前途持有怀疑态度的人。再没有人认为农业中学“出胎不正，寿命不长”了。农业中学越办越好的事实，显示了这种新型学校充沛旺盛的生命力。
    这所学校初办时仅仅有两个班七十二名学生，现在已经发展到六个班、二百六十多名学生，每日出席率平均在98％以上。师生以校为家，爱校如家。简直是棒打也打不散。学校根据农业中学的性质，妥善安排教学与生产劳动时间，作到学习、生产两不误，按时完成计划。教师起早贪黑，不辞辛苦，认真负责，热心教学；学生勤勉读书，刻苦学习，教学质量已经赶上普通中学。10月间，县委宣传部对开安农中和农安三中二年级的各一个班的学生进行了对比测验，结果，两校语文科成绩相似，而数学成绩开安农中比三中高很多。
    在生产上，学校建立了有二十五公顷土地的农场和小型木工厂、土化肥厂、编织厂。饲养了六匹马、十六头牛、二十口猪和八箱蜂。有胶车两台、钢车轴两台，还有其他生产工具。工农副业生产，加上季节性的其他生产劳动，生产基地足以容纳全校学生进行劳动。生产基地越发巩固，生产经验越积累越多。今年，已经打响了农业生产的第一炮。由于认真的贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，试验田、基本田和一般田都获得了丰收。能为国家生产粮食五万五千四百斤，蔬菜十三万三千斤。并且在六十七亩耕地面积上获得了高产，共产粮食四万六千九百斤，平均亩产七百斤，超过了农业发展纲要指标。
    由于执行以农业为主，坚决搞好试验田，高额丰产，大搞多种经营，实行农副业并举的生产方针，经济收入也大有可观。今年到10月份为止，已收入二万一千五百四十一元。今年全年生产总值预计可达三万一千四百八十元。学生读书不花钱，并扩建了校舍，增添了教学用品和文娱、体育活动用品，实现了经费自给。从而减轻了公社和家长的负担，保证了学生更加安心学习，学校更加巩固。
    开安农业中学的迅速成长，并不是一帆风顺的，师生共同克服了前进道路上的一个又一个的困难。在战胜种种困难的过程中，对师生来说是一次深刻的考验。事实上，他们并没有把困难放在眼里，没有教室，他们就在劳动场地上课；没有食堂，他们就在露天吃饭。比较艰苦的日子已成过去，现在，教室、宿舍和食堂都有了，并且逐步完善。师生瞻前顾后，总觉得农业中学的日子越过越有奔头。
    开安农业中学的巩固、提高，是党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的胜利，是“两条腿走路”发展教育事业的方针的胜利。开安农业中学越办越好的经验是：
    坚持半工半读，提高教学质量
    开安农业中学的领导和教师深深地体会到，学生能否学到知识，是学生和家长最关心的问题，也是巩固提高农业中学的根本问题。从创办那天起，学校始终是把提高教学质量放到首要地位，把教学赶普中，作为努力教学和学习的方向。并且坚持半工半读，一般情况下以半日学习，半日劳动的半日制为主，生产忙时采取隔日制，生产不忙时，也有时采取全日制。每天坚持早晚自习三小时，实行双周休息。学校编制了全日制（每日六节）、隔日制（每日八节）、半日制（每日四节）的三种课程表，以适应灵活安排教学与生产劳动的需要，保证不论采取任何一种授课形式时，教师都能有秩序地上课，按时完成教学计划。
    学生学好，同教师教的好有很大关系。一年多来，开安农业中学注意启发教师发挥主导作用，努力提高他们的教学水平。学校和农安三中挂勾，组织教师到三中去观摩听课，教学中遇到疑难问题，就同三中的教师一起研究，虚心向三中教师学习。同时，注意学生的接受能力，设法帮助学习成绩差的学生，提高学习质量。教学还贯彻理论联系实际的原则，学生中存在什么思想问题，教师就及时通过政治课教学解决。在农业技术上，需要什么就讲什么，学完就应用，灵活处理教材，根据农业季节的需要移前或错后，书本上没有的则加以补充，课本上不适合本地应用的加以删减。并且进行现场教学，巩固了学生在书本上所学得的知识，扩大了学生的知识领域。
    学校根据学生的特点和爱好组织了课余研究小组，成立农业、园艺、木工、气象、农药、养蜂、养猪、文艺创作等活动小组。这些小组虽然成立不久，都取得了一些成绩。园艺小组研究南瓜授粉、压蔓追肥，每棵结八、九个大南瓜。农药小组研究的六种农药，已有两种试制成功。8月3日有一块小豆起了“腻虫”，他们用自己制造的农药杀虫，药效竟达100％，“腻虫”全部被消灭了。通过这种活动培养了学生科学研究的兴趣和爱好，使他们获得了丰富而实际的生产知识和技能。
    为加强学生基础知识的基本训练，学校采取了许多措施：举行了讲演比赛会、读书报告会、故事会、诗歌朗读会、作业展览会，增设了一节写字课。算术作业由每周六次增加到九次。这些措施显著地提高了学生的书写、阅读、写作和语言表达能力。
    搞好生产，实现经费自给
    在生产上，贯彻了以农业为主，坚持搞好农业科学研究试验，高额丰产，因地制宜，大搞多种经营，实行农副业并举的生产方针。
    学校在生产上认真贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，把农业“八字宪法”列入农业知识课的教学计划，通过课堂教学讲清楚农业“八字宪法”的科学道理，使学生在思想上接受农业“八字宪法”所阐述的农业生产知识和技术。并根据农业“八字宪法”制订了农业生产规划。虽然学校只种了四公顷高产试验田，可是整个学校的土地都成了公社的试验田。从春到秋，每个重要的生产环节，公社都组织人到农中来参观，并且先后在农中召开四次现场会议，传播农中的经验，对当地农业丰产起到了良好的影响。当地有些老保守，怀疑深翻和合理密植，可是农中在深翻的土地上，多穗高粮亩产一千五百斤，超出当地常年亩产一千多斤，超出当地同年最高亩产八百斤。密植小麦，播幅一尺，行距三寸，每一市方尺就有一百七十三棵小麦，小麦高达四尺，穗长四寸，平均每穗五十八粒到六十三粒，亩产七百二十斤，超出当地最高亩产三百斤。秋收时公社组织对深翻、密植有怀疑的人到农中参观，让他们开开眼界。春天一直认为农中小麦种的太密，长秆不能长穗的八十三岁老农民丘国栋也服气了，他称赞地对校长说：“你们这帮青年人可真行啊！”高额丰产的事实，教育了群众，保卫了农业“八字宪法”。
    一年多来的农业生产，使学生受到了实际教育和劳动锻炼，学到了丰富的生产知识和技能，逐步地树立了劳动人民的思想感情，对农业生产发生了兴趣和爱好。过去认为“耕地不用读书，读书的人不能种地”的思想逐渐消失了；同时普遍增强了体质和实际的劳动能力。
    此外学校还大搞多种经营，增加收入。手工业生产上，建立木工厂、编织厂和缝纫厂，饲养了家畜、家禽和蜜蜂。并根据季节特点，因地、因时制宜地开展了打柴、拣粮、拣柴草、短途运输、做工等多种劳动。因此做到了经费自给，使农业中学不断地巩固、提高。
    依靠群众，因陋就简，勤俭办学
    农业中学是人民公社办的学校。群众都把农业中学称为“自己的学校”，对它格外关心。开安农业中学从创办那天起就紧紧地依靠群众。一年多来，师生深深地体会到：离开群众将一事无成。群众，特别是学生家长和当地的机关、企业单位真是百求百应，他们都为办好农业中学能多献出自己点滴的力量而感到光荣。一年多来，群众献给借给农中的教学、生产、生活用品大的小的达二千六百多件，帮助学校克服了许多困难。
    学校中也曾出现过“比好，好胜，求新，求全，图阔气，讲排场”的思想。学校根据党委的指示，通过反复讨论研究，大家一致认识到，办好农中必须贯彻因陋就简，勤俭办学的原则。一年多来，初步摸索到了“少花钱，多办事，不花钱也办事”的规律，即：在设备用品方面，能代用的，坚决代用。能借用的，坚决不买。在经费开支方面，可花可不花的，坚决不花，把钱用到当处。在学校建设方面，自己能做得来的，师生动手，坚决不雇用外人。一年多来，在教学、生产和学校建设方面，约计节省八千多元。这样做，也培养了学生勤劳节俭的品质。当地群众口口声声称赞农中师生是“过家能手”。
    依靠公社党委领导，坚持政治挂帅
    开安农中从创办到现在，校舍、师资、生产劳动基地等，无一不是由于公社党委的领导和重视才解决的。公社党委决定第一书记李宝山同志兼任农中校长，社长马振华同志兼任副校长，他们经常深入农中具体指导，并加派了领导干部和师资。人民公社化时，公社党委在统一安排中，给农中解决了房舍，调拨了十八垧六亩二分土地，一台胶车六匹马。今年10月份又拨给一台胶车。这就为农中实现生产自给创造了物质条件。为了办好木工厂，给农中派了一名技术员。李宝山书记除及时指示农中生产方向外，并亲自帮助农中找生产门路，增加了收入，解决了经费自给问题。公社书记们经常到地里和学生们在一起劳动，指导学生的生产劳动。春季农中许多粪肥一时送不到地里，公社党委就派三十台胶车帮助农中送粪。秋收时也派胶车帮助拉庄稼。公社党委鉴于农中半工半读，要提高教学质量，还要通过生产劳动解决经费自给问题，所以尽力为农中按时完成教学和生产计划创造有利条件。更重要的是公社党委经常在干部和群众中宣传办好农中的目的和意义以及农中的好处，坚持政治挂帅，解决干部和群众中对农中的错误认识，领导和发动群众办好自己的学校——农业中学。领导办好农中已列入开安人民公社党委的工作日程了，农中一有困难就讨论解决。公社党委加强对农中的领导，是巩固提高农业中学的根本保证。这些问题的解决，没有人民公社的建立也是很难办到的事情。农业中学越办越好，充分的显示了人民公社的无比的优越性。
