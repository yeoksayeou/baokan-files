Several Questions on Agricultural Mechanization
Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Industry and agriculture are the two most important sectors of the national economy, and agriculture is the foundation for developing the national economy. To develop the national economy at a high speed, it is necessary to implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. To rapidly develop agriculture, it is necessary to complete the thorough transformation of the social and economic system and the comprehensive transformation of agricultural technology in rural areas. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "Only when China has thoroughly completed the socialist transformation in terms of the social and economic system, and uses machines in all departments and places where machines can be used, can the entire social and economic landscape be completely changed." At the same time, he pointed out that rural reform, with the development of agricultural cooperation and the gradual increase of large-scale agricultural machinery, will gradually shift from social reform as the main focus and technical reform as the auxiliary to social reform and technical reform advancing simultaneously.

Heilongjiang Province, like the rest of the country, completed agricultural cooperation in 1956; in 1958, it also realized the people's commune system. The agricultural Great Leap Forward and bumper harvests of 1958 and 1959 proved that the people's commune movement not only further liberated rural productive forces, but also promoted the rapid development of industry, creating more favorable conditions for the technical transformation of agriculture. At present, with the people's communes in rural areas embarking on a path of consolidation, sound development, and the socialist industrialization having a preliminary and good foundation, our task is to further implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, combine giving priority to the development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and realize the technical transformation of agriculture as soon as possible to promote faster agricultural production and promote the sustained and comprehensive leap forward of the entire national economy.

The technical transformation of agriculture and the promotion of agricultural mechanization have a history of more than ten years in Heilongjiang Province. Now agricultural mechanization has a preliminary and good foundation. The province already has seventy-five large-scale state-owned mechanized farms, and two hundred and thirty-seven of the six hundred and sixty-one people's communes have tractors. The province has a total of 12,000 standard tractors, 140,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage power machinery, and 23,000 sets of tractor-drawn farm implements. The area cultivated by machines has reached more than 20% of the total cultivated area. If the land cultivated by 240,000 sets of new-style animal-powered farm implements is added, the land cultivated by mechanization and semi-mechanization has reached about 50% of the existing cultivated area. At the same time, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain processing and feed crushing also have a considerable foundation.

Agricultural mechanization can improve agricultural labor productivity and the commodity rate of agricultural products

The facts of promoting agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province show that the implementation of agricultural mechanization has huge effects and far-reaching significance both politically and economically. Lenin once pointed out in "A Great Beginning": "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and principal condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system." The benefits brought to us by promoting agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province are many, but the most fundamental is the improvement of agricultural labor productivity and the commodity rate of agricultural products. In the past ten years, the province has reclaimed more than 20 million mu of wasteland, expanding the cultivated area by a quarter on the original basis, of which 80% was reclaimed by machines. In the past ten years, agricultural production has achieved comprehensive and great development, with the total agricultural output value increasing by nearly two times, and the commodity rate of agricultural products reaching about 45%, which is also closely related to the development of agricultural mechanization. Facts prove that the labor value and commodity rate of agricultural products created by using different agricultural production tools are very different. Taking 1959 as an example, state-owned farms that have basically realized mechanization create an average annual output value of about 3,000 yuan per worker, produce about 30,000 jin of grain, and have a commodity rate of 74%. Semi-mechanized people's communes (mainly using new-style farm implements, with a small number of tractors) create an average annual output value of about 1,200 yuan per worker, produce about 15,000 jin of grain, and have a commodity rate of 60%. Communes with a larger proportion of old-style farm implements create an average annual output value of about 700 yuan per worker, produce about 8,000 jin of grain, and have a commodity rate of only about 40%.

Due to the improvement of agricultural labor productivity and the commodity rate of agricultural products, agriculture in Heilongjiang Province has strongly supported the development of socialist industrial construction. In the ten years from 1949 to 1958, the rural areas of our province provided the state with more than 40 billion jin of commercial grain, more than 24 billion jin of soybeans, more than 8 billion jin of non-staple foods such as meat, eggs, and vegetables, provided a large amount of industrial raw materials and native and sideline products, and also transported a large amount of labor to support industrial construction. Agriculture supported industry with grain, non-staple foods, industrial raw materials, and labor, while industry supported agriculture with a large amount of means of production and means of livelihood. Mutual support and common development embody the new type of relationship between industry and agriculture, workers and peasants, cities and villages under the socialist system, and further consolidate and develop the worker-peasant alliance.

Due to the promotion of agricultural mechanization, the collective economy of the people's communes has also been promoted rapidly, and the elements of ownership by the whole people have been continuously expanded. It is now clear that communes with a higher degree of mechanization generally have the characteristics of "four more," that is, more production projects, more capital construction, more production income, and more public accumulation. This creates extremely favorable conditions for the gradual transition from the basic ownership of the management area to the basic ownership of the commune and from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people.

Although agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province has a preliminary and good foundation, as a whole, the technical transformation of agriculture in the past ten years has been carried out on a small scale and partially, which is in line with the historical conditions of the past. After the construction during the First Five-Year Plan period and the Great Leap Forward of the past two years since 1958, socialist industrialization in our country has laid a preliminary and good foundation, and it is now possible to provide more material and technical assistance for the technical transformation of agriculture; the people's communes in rural areas have embarked on a path of consolidation and sound development, providing more favorable conditions for the realization of agricultural technical transformation. Therefore, we are already facing a new period of comprehensively and on a large scale carrying out agricultural technical transformation.

This situation is even more obvious in Heilongjiang Province. In the fifteen years since liberation, the economic construction of Heilongjiang Province has gone through three major stages: the restoration of the national economy, the First Five-Year Plan, and the Great Leap Forward since 1958. Due to the victory of these three stages, our province has been transformed from a "Great Northern Wilderness" with a very weak industrial base into one of the country's new and important industrial bases with heavy industry as the center and modern large-scale enterprises as the backbone. In 1959, the proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value will reach about 74%. Because industry has a relatively strong foundation, it is fully capable of providing more support for the technical transformation of agriculture. In terms of agriculture, due to the consolidation and development of people's communes and the continuous bumper harvests in agricultural production for two consecutive years, coupled with the preliminary good foundation of agricultural mechanization and the preparation of a certain amount of experience and cadre forces, the conditions for comprehensively realizing agricultural mechanization on a larger scale and at a higher speed are also available. Considering these increasingly mature conditions and the urgent need for mechanization in Heilongjiang Province due to its large land area, small population, and shortage of labor, in order to develop industrial and agricultural production at a high speed, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, put forward the slogan of striving to realize agricultural mechanization within seven years (that is, within the next five years from now) in the spring of 1958. Once this slogan was put forward, it was warmly welcomed and supported by the masses. The vast number of peasants and rural cadres spread the word, actively trying to prepare conditions such as funds and technical forces for agricultural mechanization. Realizing mechanization as soon as possible has become the most enthusiastic and urgent demand in rural areas, and the people of the province are working hard to achieve this goal.

The struggle between two roads and two methods in the process of realizing agricultural mechanization

Realizing agricultural mechanization and carrying out the technical transformation of agriculture is another great revolution in rural areas. From the practice of promoting agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province for more than ten years, like all previous revolutionary movements, in the technical revolution movement, we will also encounter various ideological obstacles, and there is a struggle between two roads and two methods. If we do not first remove the various ideological obstacles on the road ahead, the smooth progress of agricultural mechanization will be impossible.

In the process of promoting agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province, some cadres and the masses had different opinions on the issue of whether or not to have agricultural mechanization and who to rely on to realize agricultural mechanization. Although no one openly raised the banner of opposing mechanization, in fact, people who doubted or even opposed mechanization were not isolated cases. Agricultural mechanization is to transfer agriculture from the past backward technical foundation to a modern technical foundation, and further liberate agricultural productive forces. This cannot but touch the backward and conservative farming techniques, farming systems, and outdated agricultural habits of farmers, and correspondingly adjust the backward relations of production built on the small-scale peasant economy, thus inevitably encountering resistance and opposition from some right-leaning conservative elements. Some people regard the extensive management of agriculture through manual labor and animal-powered tools as an inviolable tradition, and they completely lack enthusiasm for agricultural mechanization, such a huge technical reform. They accused: "Agricultural mechanization destroys the farmers' traditional farming system," "destroys the farmers' inherent experience," and "there has been no increase in production for thousands of years without mechanization." Some people not only made a lot of comments, but also conducted so-called "scientific investigations" and wrote articles, trying to prove that their views were "correct" and demanding that we abandon the promotion of agricultural mechanization. We carried out a resolute struggle against this right-leaning ideology from the stubborn conservative forces of the small-scale peasant economy. We conducted extensive and in-depth education on agricultural technical revolution for cadres and the broad masses, criticized right-leaning conservative ideas, and through typical demonstrations, organized visits, and comparisons of new and old farming systems and farming methods, we made the broad masses of cadres and the people believe in the unparalleled superiority of agricultural mechanization and developed an increasingly firm confidence and an increasingly high enthusiasm for agricultural mechanization.

How to combine agricultural mechanization with the inherent farming system and farming methods is certainly very important, but the question is what attitude to take towards this point. We must accept many valuable experiences accumulated by farmers in their production practices over thousands of years as a treasure and apply and develop them. At the same time, we must combine mechanization with local natural conditions and inherent experience. The idea and practice of negating all traditional experience is certainly wrong and not conducive to increasing production. However, in any case, we cannot use the absorption of farmers' traditional experience as an excuse to oppose the fundamental direction of agricultural mechanization. We must adopt a scientific analysis attitude towards the experience of the original agricultural production, distinguishing between those experiences that are still useful under the new production conditions and those that have become obstacles to the development of production under the new production conditions. For the former, we should accept and develop them; for the latter, we should abandon them. The mistake of some people with right-leaning conservative ideas lies in their advocacy of the "long live" inherent farming system. They believe that everything inherent cannot be touched at all, and they are actually trying to make agricultural production stay at the level of extensive farming and heavy manual labor of "hook plow" and "sparse planting on large ridges" forever. Therefore, their advocacy is completely contrary to the law of social development and the demands of the broad masses of farmers, and it is bound to be resolutely opposed by the broad masses. Facts have proved that the good experience accumulated by farmers in their hard work for thousands of years does not contradict the promotion of agricultural mechanization, and that the good use of these experiences will only help to maximize the effectiveness of mechanization. The success of many places in Heilongjiang Province in promoting agricultural mechanization and obtaining large-scale increases in production is precisely due to the correct absorption of the original useful production experience of farmers, so that agricultural mechanization and the original useful production experience of farmers are closely combined. What mechanization destroys are some of the old rules and bad habits that limit the development of productive forces, and it does not prevent the inheritance and promotion of the original useful experience of farmers. It is completely wrong to oppose the technical transformation of agriculture under the pretext of maintaining the original production experience of farmers.

The implementation of agricultural mechanization, like any new work, has a process of gradual accumulation of experience, and it is impossible to avoid some shortcomings in the development process. In the initial period of trying out agricultural mechanization in our province, some places encountered some temporary difficulties in technology and management due to lack of experience, and there were also some local shortcomings in the work, which was originally a very natural thing. However, people with right-leaning ideas turned a blind eye to the great superiority of mechanization, and exaggerated and indiscriminately accused some local and temporary shortcomings, saying that "agricultural mechanization is becoming more and more costly and has become a bottomless pit," "has become a heavy burden," and so on; they spread doubts and negative emotions about agricultural mechanization and created ideological confusion. We have also waged a resolute struggle against this right-leaning ideology.

Is mechanization "becoming more and more costly"? The fact is not so. The mistake of people with right-leaning ideas lies in: they ignore the fundamental facts of high output, large commodity rate, increased social wealth, and improved cultural technology and people's living standards brought about by mechanization, and they isolate and unilaterally calculate the so-called "costs," and even include some expenses that have nothing to do with mechanization in the accounts of mechanization, in order to exaggerate the shortcomings of mechanization. Therefore, as long as the comprehensive facts are presented, this right-leaning argument cannot but immediately go bankrupt. In the past, individual farms and cooperatives did have losses, but this was a problem of insufficient experience in initial management and operation, which had nothing to do with the direction of mechanization. Therefore, even in such cooperatives, after carefully summing up the lessons learned, the situation was quickly changed, and production was greatly developed: from losing money to increasing income, from not much increase in income to a lot of increase in income. Especially after the operating form of large-scale machines was adjusted, the level of management and operation was improved, and the situation of losing money no longer existed at all. Xingnong People's Commune in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, has a mechanization rate of 33%, which is a commune with a relatively high mechanization rate in the province. Since they promoted mechanization in 1956, output has increased year by year. In 1959, each agricultural laborer produced 17,632 jin of grain, exceeding the provincial average of 76% per agricultural laborer. The state-owned Zhao Guang Farm, which has a mechanization rate of 75%, produced an average of 39,000 jin of grain per agricultural worker in 1959, which is three times higher than the average production level of each agricultural laborer in the province. All of these fully demonstrate that the higher the degree of mechanization, the more it can liberate productive forces, the more it can improve labor productivity, the more it can improve production levels, and increase income. The saying that "the higher the degree of mechanization, the more money is lost" is completely unfounded.

Is the realization of agricultural mechanization solely dependent on the state, or on the broad masses? This was another focus of the debate on mechanization in Heilongjiang Province. In the period when large-scale machines still took the form of tractor stations, that is, operated by the state and rented by farmers, the debate on this issue was reflected in the amount of plowing fees. After the realization of the people's commune system and the transfer of tractors to the operation of the people's communes, that is, self-run by the masses and assisted by the state, this debate turned to whether it was entirely dependent on state loans or mainly on self-raised funds from the masses to purchase machinery while the state provided necessary assistance. If this problem mainly manifested itself in the past in the thinking of some farmers who wanted to take advantage of the state when paying plowing fees, then now it is mainly manifested in a kind of endowment view or a thought of simply relying on the state in the minds of some cadres. When formulating plans, they demand a fast speed and a high degree of mechanization, which is certainly a good phenomenon, but they expect the state to solve all or most of the funding problems and technical problems. They believe that farmers are "poor and blank," and cannot solve the funding problems of mechanization, nor can they master modern agricultural technology. Therefore, they believe that technical revolution is different from social revolution, and that whether it is a funding problem or a technical problem, it can only be solved by relying on the state, and the farmers themselves are powerless. From this, they conclude that mass movements can be carried out on a large scale in democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and that it is impossible to carry out mass movements on a large scale in the agricultural technical transformation movement.

We also conducted a resolute criticism of this idea. Of course, the state actively supports agricultural mechanization, and this is exactly the case. However, the state's funds and machinery are limited, and it is impossible to fully meet the needs of all rural people's communes within a certain period of time. The idea of only knowing how to reach out to the state can only make agricultural mechanization less, slower, worse, and more expensive. The facts in our province prove that where there is a view of endowment and a thought of simply relying on the state, there is no mass movement to carry out mechanization on a large scale. Therefore, not only are there no preparations in terms of funds and technical forces for mechanization, but also there is no progress in the mechanization of non-field operations that can be completely done with one's own strength, and even tool reform is rarely carried out. On the contrary, where the masses are truly relied on, the mechanization movement is in full swing, and many difficulties are solved easily, and agricultural mechanization can be done more, faster, better, and more economically. For example, Xingnong People's Commune in Baiquan County, relying on the strength of the masses, raised funds and added necessary assistance from the state to purchase 68 tractors (standard units) in four years, one of which was purchased by housewives with income from sideline production. In more than a year after having tractors, they trained more than 100 tractor drivers, and now they do not feel that the funding and technical problems of agricultural mechanization are insurmountable difficulties. Although many places in Heilongjiang Province cannot purchase large-scale agricultural implements such as tractors for a while, they have accelerated the mechanization in non-agricultural operations by vigorously mobilizing the masses. For example, in Boli County, mechanization has reached more than 60% in production such as threshing, agricultural product processing, and feed crushing, which is mainly achieved by the strength of the masses themselves.

The above facts show that the masses have unlimited potential. Under the leadership of the Party, they not only relied on their own strength to break an old world and liberate themselves, but also have the full strength to build a new world and create their own beautiful new life. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the masses to carry out mass movements on a large scale in the social revolution, and the same is true in the technical revolution. Only by adopting the method of carrying out mass movements on a large scale to promote agricultural mechanization can we speed up the pace, and only by mainly relying on the masses' own funds and strength can the masses more deeply appreciate that mechanization is not easy to come by, and can more stimulate their enthusiasm to improve management and operation and care for machinery. Therefore, the idea of simply relying on the state in the issue of mechanization is very detrimental to the realization of mechanization and must be resolutely overcome. Of course, the state must provide assistance for such a major technical transformation task as agricultural mechanization, and it has already provided a lot of assistance in the past, and will provide more assistance in the future, but the state's assistance must be combined with the strength of the masses to play a greater role.

After overcoming various ideological obstacles and work difficulties, we have laid a certain foundation for agricultural mechanization after more than ten years of arduous construction, and now we are facing a new period of carrying out agricultural technical transformation on a large scale. In this new period, the struggle between the two roads and the two methods that was manifested in the past mechanization process will certainly not cease. As long as there is still class struggle in the countryside, and there is still a struggle between the advanced and the backward, this struggle will inevitably be reflected in various forms in the technical transformation movement. Therefore, we believe that continuing to persist in opposing right-leaning opportunism and the thinking of wealthy middle peasants, and continuing to improve the socialist awareness of the broad masses of cadres and the masses and their understanding of the great significance of agricultural mechanization, is very important for the victorious completion of the task of technical transformation. The more the agricultural technical transformation is fully accelerated, the more necessary it is to strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, carry out mass movements on a large scale, criticize and eliminate various erroneous ideas, so as to ensure the victorious realization of the great historical task of agricultural technical transformation.

Several basic experiences in realizing agricultural mechanization

Agricultural mechanization is a new topic for us. In the past ten years, Heilongjiang Province has had successful experiences and has also experienced some twists and turns in the process of trying out agricultural mechanization. The task of further promoting agricultural mechanization on a large scale and realizing agricultural technical transformation requires us to seriously summarize the past experience.

Agricultural mechanization is a problem of industrial equipment agriculture and the realization of agricultural modernization, and it also directly involves the comprehensive transformation of rural areas from the political and ideological and cultural aspects. The realization of agricultural mechanization and the high-speed development of agricultural production will inevitably cause a series of huge changes in industry, transportation, finance and trade, and science and culture, requiring the work of all relevant parties to adapt to the progress of this great transformation work. At the same time, such a major technical transformation task cannot be undertaken solely by the agricultural sector without the unified leadership of the Party and without mutual support and cooperation from all parties. Therefore, it is necessary to make all cadres clearly realize that the realization of agricultural mechanization is the common task of the whole Party and the whole people, and first of all, it is the glorious task of the industrial sector. We must strengthen the unified leadership of the Party, implement comprehensive planning, and organize close coordination and cooperation among all parties. After the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan of realizing agricultural mechanization within seven years in the spring of 1958, under the provincial Party committee's policy of "relying on the Party, relying on the masses, having a center, having a backbone, comprehensive planning, and comprehensive leap forward," it further strengthened the Party's leadership over the agricultural mechanization cause, organized the forces of all parties to cooperate and cooperate, and set off a climax of the agricultural mechanization movement, greatly advancing the speed of mechanization. However, some comrades have shortcomings in the implementation of this spirit. On the one hand, the agricultural sector itself has not actively and proactively communicated the situation with other departments and strived for support; on the other hand, other departments have not fully understood the great significance of agricultural mechanization, thinking that this is only a matter for the rural work departments, and have not actively and proactively provided support, thus some problems that could have been solved have not been solved in a timely manner. After we corrected the above shortcomings, the situation has changed greatly, and a new situation of unified leadership, comprehensive planning, and close coordination and cooperation among all parties to support agricultural mechanization has been launched. In practice, we deeply realize that strengthening the unified leadership of the Party, implementing comprehensive planning, and organizing cooperation and coordination among all parties are the fundamental conditions for realizing agricultural mechanization more, faster, better, and more economically. With the arrival of the task of comprehensively transforming agricultural technology, unified leadership, comprehensive planning, and cooperation and coordination have even more prominent importance. In order to promote the victorious realization of the task of agricultural mechanization, the Party's leading organs must first carry out sufficient ideological work and organizational work in this regard.

According to the characteristics of agricultural production in Heilongjiang Province and the needs of developing diversified operations, our policy of realizing agricultural mechanization is to focus on the mechanization of field operations and to promote the mechanization of field operations and non-field operations simultaneously. This is also an important way to realize agricultural mechanization more, faster, better, and more economically. In the initial period of trying out agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province, due to lack of experience, some state-owned farms only isolatedly engaged in the mechanization of field operations, while other operating projects that required a lot of labor still used manual labor, thus increasing the cost of production and even leading to losses. Some cooperatives also understood the scope of agricultural mechanization too narrowly, thinking that only the use of tractors can be considered mechanization, so when there were no tractors, they did not actively carry out the mechanization or semi-mechanization of non-field operations that could be solved by their own efforts, thus hindering the faster realization of mechanization. At the same time, many places have taken the approach of "mechanizing whatever can be mechanized first," and have quickly realized mechanization in non-field operations under the condition of no tractors. These experiences have made us realize that: it must be affirmed that the mechanization of field operations is the center of the entire agricultural mechanization, and the task of agricultural mechanization cannot be considered finally solved without implementing the mechanization of field operations. However, we must never neglect the mechanization of non-field operations because of this. In fact, solving the mechanization of non-field operations is equally important. On the one hand, the amount of labor required for non-field operations is very large, generally accounting for about 40% of the total labor in rural areas. Without mechanization, this part of the heavy manual labor cannot be liberated, and production cannot be fully developed. On the other hand, the machines required for non-field operations are relatively simple and easy to manufacture, and many local industries and even commune industries can produce them. Therefore, the speed of mechanization of non-field operations can be faster than the mechanization of field operations. The idea of passively waiting for tractors and neglecting the mechanization of non-field operations is obviously wrong.

The implementation of agricultural mechanization and the comprehensive technical transformation of agriculture, like other new things, will inevitably go through a gradual development process from less to more and from low to high, and it is impossible to overstep this objective process. Therefore, in the process of promoting agricultural mechanization, in order to ensure that agricultural production can continue to develop when agricultural machinery cannot fully meet the needs, we must make full use of existing conditions and make as much use as possible of the role of draught animals and new-style agricultural implements. The idea of opposing the promotion of mechanization with the development of draught animals and the improvement of existing agricultural implements is very detrimental. In the process of trying out mechanization in Heilongjiang Province, individual places once had a bias against excluding draught animals and not actively reforming existing tools, which affected production. To this end, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of "combining machines, horses, and cattle" and "combining mechanization and tool reform" in the spring of 1958, correcting the above one-sided thinking. This issue must still be paid attention to for a considerable period of time in the future.

In the work of promoting agricultural mechanization, correctly solving the problem of the operating mode of agricultural machinery is of great significance. In the process of promoting agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province, the solution of this problem has gone through several stages. Initially, the form of organizing tractor stations to implement plowing was generally implemented, which was appropriate at that time when the economic strength of the cooperative was weak and the experience was less. However, because farmers did not participate in the management of machines, it affected the发挥 (fāhuī, to bring into play) of machine efficiency, the improvement of cultivation quality, and the reduction of costs. Later, with the increase in the public accumulation of agricultural production cooperatives and the improvement of management and operation levels, we adopted the method of agricultural production cooperatives purchasing and using agricultural machinery on their own, and implemented社有社营 (shè yǒu shè yíng, cooperative ownership and operation). In the initial stage of implementing this method, it was inevitable to encounter some difficulties in managing and using modern machinery, but the difficulties were quickly solved, and the shortcomings of the previous stage of implementing plowing were overcome. Therefore, this method was very popular among the masses and was quickly promoted throughout the province as the main form. After the people's commune system, due to the fact that the scope of operation of the commune was much larger than that of the cooperative, there were new changes in the operating mode. At the beginning, there were three forms of operation for large-scale agricultural machines: (1) Cooperative ownership and operation, plowing for the management area. This form has great benefits for the unified mobilization and concentrated use of agricultural machines and for increasing the components of the collective ownership of the commune. However, because the management area is not responsible for operation, it is not convenient to establish a production responsibility system, so it has adverse effects on improving machine utilization, operating quality, and reducing costs. (2) District ownership and operation (in Heilongjiang Province, the management area is the basic economic accounting unit of the commune). This form has many benefits in terms of establishing a production responsibility system,发挥 (fāhuī, to bring into play) machine efficiency, improving operating quality, and reducing costs, but the biggest problem is that it is not conducive to the unified leadership of the commune and gradually expanding the factors of ownership at the commune level, nor is it conducive to the unified scheduling of machines and the development of mechanization. (3) Cooperative ownership and district operation, that is, agricultural machines are owned by the commune and used by the management area, and the management area is responsible for repairs and costs. The implementation of this method basically solves the problems existing in the above two methods, which can both promote the expansion of ownership at the commune level and clarify the responsibility system, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses to care for machines. Therefore, this form has now been widely adopted. At the same time, we are also considering turning the state's investment and loans for agricultural mechanization into machines invested in the commune, and implementing state-owned cooperative operation or state-cooperative joint operation, which can ensure that funds and loans are invested in the most effective aspects, and can greatly increase the factors of ownership by the whole people. In short, the operating mode of agricultural machines is a major issue, which changes with economic development and the transformation of ownership. The choice of operating mode should be based on the principle of facilitating the壮大 (zhuàngdà, to strengthen) of the commune's economy and the development of production. In the future, with economic development and the transformation of ownership, new operating forms will also emerge.

According to the experience of Heilongjiang Province, in the process of promoting mechanization, when the number of machines is still insufficient, it is necessary to adopt the policy of focusing on concentrated use and appropriately taking care of the overall situation. Based on the consideration of being conducive to the development of agricultural production and being conducive to freeing up more labor to develop industry and other undertakings, we have focused on投放 (tóufàng, to put into operation) machines. In this way, on the one hand, we can systematically and comprehensively accumulate experience, which is more conducive to showing the superiority of mechanization; on the other hand, we can save equipment, save funds, and avoid waste, so that the initial limited agricultural machinery can发挥 (fāhuī, to bring into play) a greater role. Therefore, this method is much better than the effect of average distribution and decentralized use. Of course, in order to more widely obtain experience and gradually comprehensively promote agricultural mechanization, it is also necessary to give consideration to general areas.

Due to the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong and the assistance of brother regions, after more than ten years of efforts, agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province has laid a preliminary foundation, but our experience is still very insufficient. Heilongjiang Province has vast and flat land, and developed industry and transportation, which are very favorable conditions for the realization of agricultural mechanization; the land is fertile, and the agricultural commodity rate is relatively high, and the realization of agricultural mechanization can provide huge wealth for the country; there is a large land area and a small population, and there is a serious shortage of labor, which is a very urgent need for the implementation of agricultural mechanization. Now the Party Central Committee has further emphasized and put forward the great call to accelerate the realization of agricultural technical transformation, which has given the entire cadres and masses of Heilongjiang Province great encouragement. In the face of the people of Heilongjiang Province who eagerly look forward to the early realization of agricultural mechanization and rural modernization, the glorious task of comprehensively and on a large scale carrying out agricultural technical transformation has been put forward. Our Heilongjiang Provincial Party Organization and the people are determined to, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, resolutely implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and a complete set of policies of "walking on two legs," and are full of confidence to victoriously realize the great task of agricultural technical transformation, to build Heilongjiang Province, the northern border of the motherland, into a more prosperous, happy, and beautiful place, and contribute greater strength to the task of building a great socialist new China with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

    工业和农业是国民经济的两个最重要的部门，农业又是发展国民经济的基础。为高速度地发展国民经济，必须贯彻执行在优先发展重工业的前提下发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，而为迅速发展农业，就必须在农村完成社会经济制度的彻底改造和农业技术的全面改造。毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”一文中说：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”同时指出，农村的改革，将随着农业合作化的发展，大型农业机器的逐渐增加，从以社会改革为主、技术改革为辅，逐渐转为社会改革与技术改革同时并进。
    黑龙江省和全国一样，在1956年就完成了农业的合作化；1958年又实现了人民公社化。1958、1959连续两年的农业大跃进大丰收证明，人民公社化运动不仅进一步解放了农村生产力，并且促进了工业的迅速发展，为农业的技术改造创造了更有利的条件。当前在农村人民公社已经走上了巩固的健全发展的道路和社会主义工业化已有了初步良好基础的条件下，我们的任务就是要进一步贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，把优先发展重工业与迅速发展农业结合起来，尽快地实现农业的技术改造，推行农业机械化，以便更快地发展农业生产，促进整个国民经济的持续的全面跃进。
    进行农业技术改造，推行农业机械化，在黑龙江省已经有了十多年的历史。现在农业机械化已经有了初步的良好基础。全省已有七十五个大型国营机械农场，在六百六十一个人民公社中已有二百三十七个有了拖拉机。全省共有拖拉机一万二千标准台，排灌动力机械十四万马力，机引农具二万三千台，机耕面积已达耕地总面积的20％以上，如果加上二十四万台新式畜力农具耕种的土地，则机械化、半机械化耕作的土地已达现有耕地面积的50％左右。同时在粮米加工、饲料粉碎方面的机械化、半机械化也有了相当的基础。
    农业机械化能提高农业劳动生产率和农产品商品率
    黑龙江省推行农业机械化的事实表明，实行农业机械化不论在政治上经济上都有巨大的效果和深远的意义。列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中曾经指出：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。”黑龙江省推行农业机械化为我们带来的好处甚多，但最根本的也正是提高了农业的劳动生产率和农产品的商品率。十年来全省共开垦荒地二千余万亩，使耕地面积在原有基础上扩大了四分之一，其中就有80％是用机器开垦的。十年来农业生产获得了全面大发展，农业总产值提高了将近两倍，农业产品商品率达45％左右，这也与农业机械化的发展有密切的关系。事实证明：使用不同的农业生产工具所创造的劳动价值和农产品商品率是有很大不同的。以1959年为例，基本上实现了机械化的国营农场平均一个劳动力全年创造产值三千元左右，生产粮食三万斤左右，商品率占74％。半机械化的人民公社（主要使用新式农具，同时有少数拖拉机）平均一个劳动力全年创造的产值为一千二百元左右，生产粮食一万五千斤左右，商品率占60％。使用旧式农具比重较大的公社，平均一个劳动力全年创造产值七百元左右，生产粮食八千斤左右，商品率约只占40％。
    由于农业劳动生产率和农产品商品率的提高，黑龙江省农业有力地支援了社会主义工业建设事业的发展。1949年至1958年的十年中，我省农村为国家提供商品粮四百多亿斤、大豆二百四十多亿斤、肉蛋蔬菜等副食品八十多亿斤，提供了大量工业原料和土副产品，还输送了大量劳动力支援工业建设。农业以粮食、副食品、工业原料和劳动力支援了工业，工业又以大量的生产资料和生活资料支援了农业，相互支援，共同发展，体现了社会主义制度下工业和农业、工人和农民、城市和乡村的新型关系，使工农联盟得到了进一步的巩固和发展。
    由于农业机械化的推行，也促进了人民公社集体经济的迅速发展和全民所有制因素的不断扩大。现在已经可以明显地看出：凡是机械化程度较高的公社一般都具有“四多”的特点，即生产项目多、基本建设多、生产收入多、公共积累多。这样就为逐步地由管理区的基本所有制向公社基本所有制和由集体所有制向全民所有制的过渡创造了极为有利的条件。
    黑龙江省农业机械化虽然已经有了初步的良好基础，但整个说来，过去十年来农业技术改造还是小规模地、部分地进行的，这是符合过去的历史条件的。经过第一个五年计划时期的建设和1958年以来两年的大跃进，我国社会主义工业化已经打下了初步的良好基础，已经有可能对农业的技术改造提供更多的物质技术援助；农村人民公社已经走上了巩固的健全发展的道路，为实现农业技术改造提供了更为有利的条件。因此，我们已经面临了全面地大规模地进行农业技术改造的新时期。
    这种情况在黑龙江省更看得十分明显。在解放以后的十五年中，黑龙江省经济建设经过了恢复国民经济、第一个五年计划和1958年以来的大跃进这样三个较大的阶段。由于这三个阶段的胜利，现在我省已经由一个原来工业基础极为薄弱的“北大荒”建成为国家的以重工业为中心、以现代化大型企业为骨干的新的重要工业基地之一，1959年工业产值在工农业总产值中的比重将达到74％左右。由于工业有了相当强大的基础，已经完全有条件为农业的技术改造提供更多的支援。在农业方面，由于人民公社的巩固发展和农业生产连续两年的大丰收，加以农业机械化已经有了初步的良好基础和一定的经验与干部力量的准备，所以以更大的规模和更高的速度，全面地实现农业机械化的条件也已经具备。考虑到这些日益成熟的条件和黑龙江省地多人少劳力不足对于机械化的迫切需要，为了高速度发展工农业生产，中共黑龙江省委根据党中央和毛泽东同志指示的精神，在1958年春季就提出了争取七年内（从现在算起也就是今后五年内）实现农业机械化的口号。这个口号一经提出之后，就受到了群众的热烈欢迎和支持。广大农民和农村干部奔走相告，积极设法为农业机械化准备资金、技术力量等条件，早日实现机械化已成为农村最热烈最迫切的要求，全省人民正为实现这一目标而努力奋斗。
    实现农业机械化过程中两条道路两种方法的斗争
    实现农业机械化，进行农业的技术改造，是农村中又一次伟大的革命。从黑龙江省十多年来推行农业机械化的实践来看，和历次革命运动一样，在技术革命运动中，同样会遇到这样或那样的思想阻力，存在着两条道路、两种方法的斗争。如果不首先扫除前进道路上的各种思想障碍，农业机械化的顺利进行是不可能的。
    黑龙江省在推广农业机械化的过程中，有一部分干部和群众就曾经在要不要农业机械化和依靠谁来实现农业机械化的问题上有过不同的意见。虽然没有人公开地打出反对机械化的旗子，但实际上怀疑以至反对机械化的人却不是个别的。农业机械化是要把农业从过去的落后技术基础转移到现代化的技术基础上来，进一步解放农业生产力，这样就不能不触动落后的、保守的耕作技术、耕作制度和陈旧的农事习惯，并相应地调整建筑在小农经济上的落后的生产关系，因而必然要受到一些右倾保守分子的抵制和反对。有一些人把农业的手工劳动和畜力工具所进行的粗放经营奉为不可侵犯的传统，而对于农业机械化这样一个巨大的技术改革却全然缺乏热情。他们指责：“农业机械化破坏了农民传统的耕作制度”，“摧毁了农民的固有经验”，“几千年来没有机械化也一样增产”。有人不仅大发议论，而且做了所谓“科学的调查”，写了文章，企图证明他们的观点是“正确”的，要求我们放弃推行农业机械化。我们对于这种来自小农经济的顽固保守势力的右倾思想进行了坚决的斗争。我们向干部和广大群众进行了广泛深入的关于农业技术革命的教育，批判了右倾保守思想，并通过典型示范、组织参观、新旧耕作制度和耕作方法对比，使广大干部和群众坚信农业机械化的无比优越性，对农业机械化产生了日益坚定的信心和日益高涨的热情。
    如何使农业机械化同固有的耕作制度和耕作方法相结合，当然是十分重要的，但问题是对于这一点采取什么态度。对于农民在几千年来的生产实践中所积累的许多宝贵经验，必须当做一项财富接受下来，并加以运用和发扬，同时要使机械化适应当地的自然条件和固有经验相结合，否定一切传统经验的思想和作法当然是错误的，不利于提高生产的。但是无论如何不能以吸收农民传统经验作为反对农业机械化这一根本方向的借口。对于原有的农业生产的经验，必须采取科学分析的态度，区别那些在新的生产条件下仍然有用的经验和那些在新的生产条件下成为妨碍生产发展的经验。对于前者，我们应当接受下来并加以发展，对于后者，我们应当加以抛弃。一些有右倾保守思想的人的错误，在于他们主张固有耕作制度“万岁”，他们认为一切固有的东西都根本触动不得，实际上是企图让农业生产永世停留在“弯钩犁”、“大垅稀植”的粗放耕作和笨重体力劳动的水平上。因此，他们的主张是完全违背社会发展的规律和广大农民的要求的，也是必然要遭到广大群众的坚决反对的。事实证明，农民在千百年来辛勤劳动中所积累起来的良好经验，和推行农业机械化并不矛盾，而且很好地运用这些经验，只会有利于更大地发挥机械化的效果。黑龙江省许多地方推行农业机械化获得大量增产的成效，正是由于正确地吸收了农民原有的有用的生产经验，使农业机械化和农民原有的有用的生产经验密切结合起来的结果。机械化所破坏的是那些限制生产力发展的一些陈规陋习，并不妨碍继承和发扬农民原有的有用经验，以维护农民原有生产经验为借口，反对农业的技术改造，是完全错误的。
    实行农业机械化，和进行任何一种新的工作一样，都有一个逐渐积累经验的过程，在发展过程中不可能没有一些缺点。我省在开始试办农业机械化的时期，有一些地方因为缺乏经验，在技术上和管理上都曾经遇到一些暂时的困难，工作中也发生过一些局部性的缺点，这本来是很自然的事情。但是具有右倾思想的人对于机械化的巨大优越性闭眼不看，而对一些局部的、暂时的缺点，却加以夸大和乱加指责，说什么“农业机械化越化越赔钱，变成了无底洞”，“成了沉重的包袱”等等；他们散布对于农业机械化的怀疑、否定情绪，制造思想上的混乱。我们对于这种右倾思想，也曾经进行过坚决的斗争。
    机械化是不是“越化越赔钱”呢？事实并不是这样。具有右倾思想的人的错误在于：他们不顾机械化所带来的产量高、商品率大、社会财富增多、文化技术和人民生活水平提高的根本性事实，而孤立地、片面地计算所谓“成本”，甚至把一些与机械化毫不相干的花销都算在机械化的账上，借以夸大机械化的缺点。因此，只要摆出全面的事实，这种右倾的论调就不能不立即破产。过去，个别的农场和合作社确实有过赔钱的情况，但是这是初期经营管理经验不足的问题，根本与机械化的方向无关。因此，即使在这样的合作社里经过认真总结经验教训，情况也很快得到改变，生产得到很大发展：由赔钱走到增加收入，由增加收入不多到增加收入很多。特别是经过调整了大型机器经营形式以后，经营管理水平提高了，赔钱的情况已经根本不存在了。黑龙江省拜泉县兴农人民公社，机械化程度达33％，是省内机械化程度较高的一个公社。他们从1956年推行机械化以来，产量逐年上升，1959年每个农业劳动力生产一万七千六百三十二斤粮食，超过全省平均每个农业劳动力生产粮食的76％，社员收入比1958年提高45％，比1957年提高64％。机械化程度占75％的国营赵光农场，1959年平均每个农业工人生产粮食三万九千斤，高出全省每个农业劳力平均生产水平的三倍。这些都充分说明机械化程度越高，越能解放生产力，越能提高劳动生产率，越能提高生产水平，增加收入，那种“机械化水平越高越赔钱”的说法完全是没有根据的。
    农业机械化的实现是单纯依靠国家，还是依靠广大群众？这在黑龙江省曾经是关于机械化问题的争论的另一个焦点。在大型机器还是采取拖拉机站的形式，即由国家经营、农民租用的时期，这个问题的争论表现在代耕费多少的问题上。人民公社化的实现和拖拉机转为人民公社经营，即群众自办、国家扶助以后，这个争论又转到是完全依靠国家贷款还是主要依靠群众自筹资金购置机械同时由国家给予必要的援助的问题上了。如果说过去这个问题，主要表现在一部分农民在缴纳代耕费上有占国家便宜的思想，那末现在则主要表现在一部分干部存在着一种恩赐观点或单纯依靠国家的思想。他们在制定规划时，要求机械化速度快、程度高，这当然是很好的现象，但是解决资金问题和技术问题却全部或大部指望国家。他们认为，农民“一穷二白”，既解决不了机械化的资金问题，也掌握不了现代化的农业技术，因此他们认为，技术革命和社会革命不同，无论是资金问题或技术问题都只有依靠国家才能解决，农民自己是无能为力的。由此他们得出结论说，民主革命和社会主义革命可以大搞群众运动，在农业技术改造运动中不可能大搞群众运动。
    我们对于这种思想也进行了坚决的批判。当然，国家对于农业机械化是积极支援的，事实也正是这样。但是国家的资金和机械有限，在一定的时间内不可能完全满足所有农村人民公社的需要。那种只知道向国家伸手的思想，结果只能使农业机械化少慢差费。我省的事实证明，哪里存在着恩赐观点、单纯依靠国家的思想，哪里就没有大搞机械化的群众运动，因而不仅在机械化的资金和技术力量等方面全无准备，而且用自己的力量完全可以做到的非田间作业的机械化也毫无进展，甚至连工具改革也搞得很少。相反的，凡是真正依靠群众的地方，机械化运动都搞得热火朝天，许多困难都迎刃而解，农业机械化就能作到多快好省。例如：拜泉县兴农人民公社在四年的时间依靠群众的力量，自筹资金，加上国家必要的扶助，已购置了六十八台（标准台）拖拉机，其中有一台是家庭妇女用副业生产的收入购买的。在有了拖拉机后一年多的时间里，他们就培养了一百多名拖拉机手，现在他们对于农业机械化的资金问题和技术问题已经不感到是什么不可克服的困难了。黑龙江省有许多地方虽然一时不能购置拖拉机等大型农具，但由于他们大力发动群众，却首先在非农田作业方面加快了机械化。如勃利县在脱谷、农产品加工、饲料粉碎等项生产中，机械化已经达到60％以上，就主要是靠群众自己的力量实现的。
    上述事实说明，群众中蕴藏着无穷的潜力，他们在党的领导下，不仅依靠自己的力量打破了一个旧世界，解放了自己，而且也完全有力量建设起来一个新世界，创造起自己的美好新生活。因此，在社会革命中要依靠群众大搞群众运动，在技术革命中同样如此。推行农业机械化只有采取大搞群众运动的方法，才能加快速度，而且只有主要的依靠群众自己的资金和力量，群众才能更深切体会到机械化来之不易，才能更激发他们改善经营管理、爱护机械的热情。因此在机械化问题上单纯依靠国家的思想，对于机械化的实现是十分不利的，必须坚决克服。当然，对于农业机械化这样一个重大的技术改造任务，国家是一定要给以帮助的，并且过去已经给了很大的帮助，今后还会给予更多的帮助，但是国家的帮助必须和群众的力量结合起来，才能发挥更大的作用。
    在克服了各种思想障碍和工作困难之后，我们经过了十多年的艰苦缔造，为农业机械化奠立了一定的基础，现在已经面临了大规模地进行农业技术改造的新时期。在这个新时期中，过去机械化过程中所表现的两条道路、两种方法的斗争当然还不会熄止。只要农村中还存在着阶级斗争，还存在着先进和落后的斗争，这种斗争就不可避免地以各种形式反映到技术改造运动中来。因此，我们认为继续坚持反对右倾机会主义和富裕中农思想，继续提高广大干部和群众的社会主义觉悟和他们对农业机械化的伟大意义的认识，这对于胜利地完成技术改造的任务是十分重要的。越是农业技术改造全面加速进行的时候，越需要加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，批判和消除各种错误思想，从而保证农业技术改造这一伟大历史任务的胜利实现。
    实现农业机械化的几点基本经验
    农业机械化对于我们是一个新的课题。十年来黑龙江省在试行农业机械化的过程中有成功的经验，也经历过一些曲折。进一步大规模地推行农业机械化、实现农业技术改造的任务，要求我们认真地总结一下过去的经验。
    农业机械化是一个工业装备农业、实现农业现代化的问题，也直接牵涉到从政治思想上以及文化上对农村进行全面改造的问题。农业实现机械化，农业生产高速度发展，必将引起工业、交通、财贸和科学文化等方面的一系列巨大变化，要求一切有关方面的工作都要与这个伟大的改造工作的进行相适应。同时，这样一个重大的技术改造任务，没有党的统一领导，没有各方面互相支援和协作，只靠农业部门本身也是担当不起来的。因此必须使全体干部都明确地认识到，实现农业机械化乃是全党全民的共同任务，首先是工业部门的光荣任务。必须加强党的统一领导，实行全面规划，组织各方面密切配合协作。中共黑龙江省委在1958年春提出七年内实现农业机械化的口号以后，在省委关于“依靠党，依靠群众，有中心，有骨干，全面规划，全面跃进”的方针下，进一步加强了党对农业机械化事业的领导，组织了各方面的力量配合协作，掀起了一个农业机械化运动的高潮，把机械化的速度大大推进了一步。但是有些同志对于这一精神的贯彻还有不足之处。一方面，农业部门本身积极主动与其它部门沟通情况、争取支持作得不够；另一方面，其它部门对农业机械化的伟大意义也认识不足，以为这只是农村工作部门的事，没有积极地主动地提供支援，因而，使一些可能解决的问题没有得到及时解决。在我们纠正了上述缺点之后，情况有了很大变化，目前已经展开了一个统一领导、全面规划、各方密切配合协作支援农业机械化的新形势。在实践中，我们深深体会到，加强党的统一领导，实行全面规划，组织各方协作配合，乃是多快好省地实现农业机械化的一个根本条件。随着农业技术全面改造任务的到来，统一领导、全面规划、配合协作，更有其突出的重要性。为促进农业机械化任务的胜利实现，党的领导机关必须首先在这方面进行足够的思想工作和组织工作。
    根据黑龙江省的农业生产的特点和发展多种经营的需要，我们实现农业机械化的方针是以田间作业的机械化为中心、田间作业和非田间作业机械化同时并举。这也是多快好省地实现农业机械化的一个重要途径。黑龙江省在试行农业机械化的初期，由于缺乏经验，某些国营农场只是孤立地搞田间作业的机械化，其它需要劳动力很多的作业项目却仍然沿用手工劳动，因而增加了生产的成本，甚至出现了亏损的现象。也有一些合作社因为对农业机械化的范围理解的过于狭窄，以为只有使用拖拉机才算机械化，所以在没有拖拉机时，对于自力可能解决的非田间作业的机械化或半机械化，也未积极进行，以至妨碍了机械化的更快实现。而与此同时，则有不少地方采取了“能先化什么，就化什么”的作法，在没有拖拉机的条件下在非田间作业方面很快地实现了机械化。这些经验使我们认识到：必须肯定田间作业的机械化是整个农业机械化的中心，不实行田间作业的机械化，农业机械化的任务即不能算作最终的解决。但是，决不能因此就忽视非田间作业的机械化。事实上解决非田间作业的机械化同样具有重大意义。一方面，非田间作业所需要的劳动量很大，一般约占农村总劳动量的40％左右，不实行机械化，这一部分的笨重体力劳动即不能得到解放，生产即不能全面发展。另一方面，非田间作业需要的机器比较简单，容易制造，其中有许多地方工业以至公社工业都可以生产。因此，非田间作业的机械化的速度可以快于田间作业的机械化。那种只是消极地等待拖拉机、忽视非田间作业机械化的思想显然是错误的。
    实行农业机械化，全面进行农业的技术改造，像其它新鲜事物一样，必然要经过一个由少到多、由低级到高级的逐渐发展的过程，企图逾越这一客观过程是不可能的。因此在推行农业机械化的过程中，为保证在农业机器还不能完全满足需要的时候，也能使农业生产得到不断发展，必须充分利用现有条件，尽可能地发挥耕畜和新式农具的作用。那种把推行机械化和发展耕畜、改良现有农具对立起来的思想是十分不利的。在黑龙江省试行机械化过程中，个别地方曾一度发生过排斥耕畜和不积极改革现有工具的偏向，使生产受到影响。为此，中共黑龙江省委在1958年春即提出了“机马牛相结合”、“机械化与工具改革相结合”的两条腿走路的方针，纠正了上述片面思想。这个问题在今后一个相当长的时期内仍必须加以注意。
    在推行农业机械化的工作上，正确地解决农业机械的经营方式问题，有很大的意义。在黑龙江省推行农业机械化的过程中，这一问题的解决曾经过几个阶段。最初普遍实行的是组织拖拉机站实行代耕的形式，这在当时合作社经济力量较弱、经验较少的情况下是适当的。但是因为农民没有参加对机器的管理，影响了机械效率的发挥、耕作质量的提高和成本的降低。其后，随着农业生产合作社公共积累的增加和经营管理水平的提高，我们采取了农业生产合作社自购自用农业机器的办法，实行了社有社营。实行这种办法的初期，管理和使用现代化机械不能不遇到一些困难，但困难很快得到了解决，并且克服了前一阶段实行代耕的缺点，因此这一方式很受群众欢迎，很快即在全省推广成为主要形式。人民公社化后，由于公社经营范围远较合作社为大，所以经营方式又有了新的变化。开始时对于大型农业机器的经营有三种形式：（1）社有社营，为管理区代耕。这种形式对于统一调动和集中使用农业机器以及增加公社集体所有制的成分等都有很大好处。但由于管理区不负经营之责，不便建立生产责任制，因此对于提高机器运用率、作业质量以及降低成本等都有不利的影响。（2）区有区营（在黑龙江省管理区为公社的基本经济核算单位）。这种形式对于建立生产责任制、发挥机器效率、提高作业质量和降低成本等方面都有很多好处，但最大的问题，是不便于公社的统一领导和逐步扩大公社一级所有制的因素，同时也不便于机器的统一调度和机械化的发展。（3）社有区营，即农业机器归公社所有、归管理区使用，管理区包修包成本。实行这种办法基本上解决了上述两种方式所存在的问题，既可以促进公社一级所有制的扩大，又可以明确责任制度，调动群众爱护机器的积极性。因此现在已普遍采取这种形式。同时我们还考虑将国家用于农业机械化的投资和贷款变成机器投到公社中去，实行国有社营或国社合营，这样可以保证把资金和贷款投到最有效的方面，并且可大大增加全民所有制的因素。总之，农业机器的经营方式是一个重大的问题，是随着经济的发展和所有制的变革而变化的。经营方式的选择应该以便于公社经济的壮大和生产的发展为原则。今后随着经济发展和所有制的变革，也还会出现新的经营形式。
    根据黑龙江省的经验，在推行机械化的过程中，当机器数量还不足的时候，采取重点集中使用、适当照顾全面的方针是必要的。我们根据有利于发展农业生产和有利于腾出更多劳力发展工业及其它事业的考虑，有重点地投放了机器。这样一方面可以系统地全面地积累经验，更有利于显示机械化的优越性；另方面可以节省设备、节约资金、避免浪费，使最初还很有限的农业机械发挥更大的作用。因此这种办法比之平均分配、分散使用的效果要好得多。当然，为了更广泛地取得经验，逐步地全面推行农业机械化，对于一般地区给予照顾也是必要的。
    由于党中央和毛泽东同志的领导以及兄弟地区的援助，经过十多年的努力，黑龙江省农业机械化初步奠定了基础，但是我们的经验还很不足。黑龙江省土地广阔、平坦，工业和交通发达，对于实现农业机械化有十分有利的条件；土地肥沃，农业商品率较高，实现农业机械化可以为国家提供巨大的财富；地多人少，劳动力严重不足，对于实行农业机械化有十分迫切的需要。现在党中央进一步强调提出了加速实现农业技术改造的伟大号召，这给黑龙江省全体干部和群众以极大的鼓舞。在殷切盼望早日实现农业机械化和农村现代化的黑龙江省人民面前，已经提出了全面地大规模地进行农业技术改造的光荣任务。我们黑龙江省党组织和人民决心在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，坚决贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，信心百倍地为胜利实现农业技术改造的伟大任务，把祖国北部边疆的黑龙江省建设成为更加繁荣幸福美丽的地方，在建设具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义新中国的任务中贡献出更大的力量。（附图片）
