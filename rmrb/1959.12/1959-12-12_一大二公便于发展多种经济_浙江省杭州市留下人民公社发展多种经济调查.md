		Brilliant Achievements of the Past Two Years
	Liuxia People's Commune is located in the northwestern suburbs of Hangzhou City. It was established in September 1958 by merging forty-one advanced agricultural cooperatives and two small market towns.
	The commune has high mountains in the south and plains and ponds in the north, with a mild climate, fertile soil, and abundant water sources. It is also rich in industrial and mineral resources, providing extremely favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
	In 1958, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's General Line for building socialism, all sectors of the economy achieved an all-round leap forward. The total value of industrial and agricultural output reached 6,788,432 yuan, an increase of 41.2% compared to 1957. Agriculture achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average rice yield of 783 jin per mu, an increase of 63% compared to 1957, and a tea yield per mu increased by 34.8% compared to 1957. The total agricultural income reached 5,049,807 yuan, an increase of 14.5% compared to 1957. Among them, planting income accounted for 50.8% of the total agricultural income, an increase of 14.2% compared to 1957; tea accounted for 12.8% of the total income, an increase of 12% compared to 1957; sericulture accounted for 10.2% of the total income, an increase of 20% compared to 1957; fisheries accounted for 19.8% of the total income, an increase of 31% compared to 1957; animal husbandry accounted for 1.3% of the total income, an increase of 252% compared to 1957; forestry accounted for 0.2% of the total income, and other sideline occupations accounted for 4.9%. The increase in economic income increased the income of the commune members and improved their material living standards.
	In terms of commune-run industry, after the establishment of the commune, factories sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. More than 20 factories were established, including a local fertilizer factory, an agricultural tool repair and manufacturing factory, an agricultural and sideline product processing factory, a bamboo product factory, a woodworking factory, a paper mill, a fiber factory, and a coal briquette factory. After the consolidation in 1959, they were merged into seven small factories. In 1958, the total value of industrial output was 1,738,625 yuan, accounting for 25% of the total value of industrial and agricultural output. The development of industrial production not only supported the overall development of agricultural production and urban industrial construction, supplied a large number of commodities to the market, and prospered the urban and rural economy, but more importantly, it took a step forward in gradually realizing the industrialization, mechanization, and electrification of the commune.
	Following the overall leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, industrial and agricultural production in the first half of this year has also achieved an unprecedented leap forward. In the first half of this year, the total value of industrial output was 1.14 million yuan, an increase of 2.2 times compared to the same period last year, exceeding the planned target by 101.6%. The total value of agricultural output reached 2.3 million yuan, an increase of 14.6% compared to the same period last year. Moreover, diversified economy in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has achieved overall increase. The unit yield of early rice increased by 30.2% compared to last year, rapeseed increased by 63%, broad beans increased by 22%, wheat increased by 9%, forestry income increased by 24.7% compared to the same period last year, sideline income increased by 106.7%, and fisheries increased by 142.43%. Spring and summer silkworms also increased accordingly. The animal husbandry and breeding industry has also made great progress due to the correct implementation of the Party Central Committee's policy of giving priority to collective breeding and combining collective breeding with private breeding. The number of pigs reached 5,500, sheep 10,600, poultry 40,000, and rabbits 2,950.

		Unified Planning and Adaptation to Local Conditions
	Liuxia People's Commune can be divided into three different economic zones based on the characteristics of its economic income structure: the mountainous area with grain as the main product and tea as the secondary product; the semi-mountainous area with tea as the main product and grain as the secondary product; and the plain area with grain as the main product and fishery and sericulture as the secondary products. Due to the different natural resources and socio-economic foundations of each economic zone, there are significant differences in production and the living standards of commune members. See the table below for details:
	Proportion of Economic Income of Each Economic Zone of Liuxia People's Commune in 1958
	Mountainous Area: Includes the original eight advanced agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 18.24% of the total number of peasant households in the commune. Mountain land accounts for about 80% of the total land area, arable land only accounts for 10%, and timber and bamboo resources are abundant. In the past, farmers made a living by cutting firewood, making paper, and producing bamboo products, with very little crop cultivation, planting some tubers on scattered slopes. Grain mainly relied on external supplies, and animal husbandry was not developed. After liberation, this backward situation was gradually changed. First, importance was attached to the development of grain and tea production, old arable land was repaired, and the planting area was expanded, so that planting and tea income increased rapidly; at the same time, animal husbandry also developed to a certain extent. In 1958, planting income accounted for 55.05% of the total income, and tea jumped to second place, which fundamentally changed the past situation where grain mainly relied on external assistance. The rapid development of production has continuously increased the income of commune members and improved their living standards.
	Semi-Mountainous Area: Includes the original six advanced agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 15.92% of the total number of peasant households. The terrain is mostly hilly, with very few plains. The crops are simple, mainly tea production. In 1958, tea production accounted for 53.17% of the total income, followed by planting income accounting for 32.70%. Sideline production has a considerable position, accounting for 11.30% of the total income. Only animal husbandry is not developed. Tea production has a long history, with generally high yields and good quality. For example, the Yangjiapailou production team had an average tea yield of 241 jin per mu, which is twice the average tea yield of the entire commune. The living standards of commune members are also higher. In 1958, the average income per commune member was 30% higher than that in the mountainous area. If animal husbandry and other sideline production can be vigorously developed in the future, it will promote the more comprehensive development of a diversified economy.
	Plain Area: Includes the original twenty-seven advanced cooperatives, accounting for 65.84% of the total number of peasant households. The whole area is crisscrossed by rivers and ponds, with mulberry and fruit trees shading the banks. The paddy fields have fertile soil, abundant water sources, and are easy to irrigate. It has always been rich in grain, fresh fish, bamboo shoots, and persimmons. Natural resources are abundant. In 1958, fishery income accounted for 25.73% of the total income, second only to planting income. Due to the relatively balanced development of a diversified economy, the total production income is relatively high, and the income level of commune members is also high. In 1958, the average income per person was 92 yuan, which was 61% higher than the average income per person in the mountainous area, 24% higher than in the semi-mountainous area, and 8.2% higher than in 1957. In this area, economic crops were more developed and grain production was less before liberation, reflecting the single production of a small-scale peasant economy. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, with the establishment and development of collective ownership in the countryside, the one-sidedness of emphasizing economic crops and neglecting grain production in the past was quickly reversed, so that grain production and other sectors could develop faster. In addition to the expansion of arable land area, the cultivation system was also improved, and the unit area yield was rapidly increased.
	The superiority of developing a diversified economy is manifested in the following aspects:
	First, it can rationally and evenly utilize labor. According to the survey of several typical production teams in different economic types of areas, it is proved that due to the differences in the development level of a diversified economy, the degree of utilization and balance of labor are significantly different, as shown in the table below:
	Labor Composition (%) of Wusi, Pingfeng, and Shenzenkou Teams Throughout the Year
	From the perspective of the annual labor usage of each team in the table, the "Wusi" team has a single crop, mainly rice, followed by tea. The annual labor usage is relatively concentrated in April-July, when it is the season for transplanting, harvesting, and picking tea, so the demand for labor is the highest. In early October-November, it is the harvest season for single-season rice and the season for planting spring flowers, so the demand for labor is also higher. In other months, the demand for labor is very low. The difference between the average monthly labor usage throughout the year is very large, with the highest labor demand being thirteen and seventy-three hundredths times the lowest. The Pingfeng team mainly produces tea, followed by rice. The labor usage is similar to that of the "Wusi" team. There are two peaks throughout the year, namely from the end of March to the beginning of August, and from the end of October to the beginning of November. The seasonality of labor usage is also very significant, with the highest being thirty-one and six hundredths times the lowest. The Shenzenkou team operates in more sectors. In addition to rice, there are sericulture, fish ponds, and fruit trees. Although the annual labor usage is relatively high from March to July and from the beginning of October to the beginning of November, the labor usage in each month is relatively balanced. The highest labor usage is two and five tenths times the lowest. Compared with the previous two, the labor usage is more balanced, thus regulating the seasonality of labor usage in agricultural production.
	Developing a diversified economy can fully and rationally utilize labor, tap labor resources, improve labor productivity, and create more material wealth for society. Judging from the value created by each person in each economic type of the commune, it proves that teams with better diversified economic development have higher labor utilization rates and create more value. Taking the above three typical teams as examples: each laborer in the "Wusi" team created a value of 296 yuan throughout the year, the Pingfeng team created 349 yuan, and the Shenzenkou team created 351 yuan, which is 18.5% more than the "Wusi" team.
	The Yangjiapailou team, in order to fully and rationally utilize labor, organized a sideline production team, in which medium and low-level laborers and the disabled accounted for 50%, and the average age of the whole team was over 50 years old. Because they were assigned to produce bamboo products such as earth baskets and bamboo baskets according to their skills, the average value created by each person per day was 2.5 yuan, and the net income was 1.5 yuan. In this way, one person can be worth a whole laborer, but if they are assigned to do farm work, three people are not worth one whole laborer.
	Second, developing a diversified economy can fully utilize natural resources, and various business departments can cooperate and support each other, which is conducive to the development of production. From the perspective of agriculture itself, it requires close cooperation and support between various departments to make the entire agricultural production leap forward. For example, the Shenzenkou production team dug pond mud on the mulberry land on the embankment, which increased the yield of mulberry leaves. The increase in mulberry leaves guaranteed the development of the silkworm industry, and silkworm feces are good fertilizers and good feeds, which can be used to feed fish and sheep, and sheep manure is both a fertilizer and can be used as fish bait, and fish manure can increase the fertility of pond mud. This team needed 557,900 dan of pond mud for rice vernalization in 1959, and 18,500 man-days. If it is converted into human manure fertilizer, it would cost 27,984 yuan. The local use of pond mud reduced the cost of each mu of rice field by 37%.
	The cooperation between various production departments is also reflected in the fast turnover of funds, which timely solves the needs of production. Mountainous and semi-mountainous areas have little cash income before the tea and grain harvests, and they feel the difficulty of cash turnover during spring plowing and fertilization and monthly wage payments. However, the plain area has more cash income from economic crops and sideline production, and the turnover is faster, which regulates the annual production costs and wage expenditures.
	After the establishment of the commune industry, it also vigorously supported agricultural production. The commune has a large rice area. In the past, rice straw was used as fuel. After the establishment of the paper mill, rice straw was used to make paper, making its utilization more rational. The establishment of an agricultural and sideline product processing factory processed potatoes into starch, and the residue was used to brew wine and then as pig feed. Rice bran was used to brew wine, and the bran residue could be used to feed pigs, and so on. The mutual utilization of agricultural by-products and industrial by-products promoted industrial production, and at the same time provided a large amount of feed for the development of animal husbandry, accelerating the development of agriculture. The local fertilizer factory was established, using local bones, shells, phosphate rock, turf, saltpeter and other raw materials to produce more than 3,790 tons of local fertilizer to support agricultural production. Diversified operations of this kind have explored and rationally utilized natural resources and promoted mutual support and overall development between production departments.
	Third, developing a diversified economy can expand public accumulation and increase the income of commune members. The comprehensive development of various sectors of the economy enables the full and rational utilization of natural resources and labor. Therefore, areas with better diversified economic production have created more wealth, expanded public accumulation, and increased the income of commune members. For example, the public accumulation in the plain area in 1958 increased by 147.2% compared to 1957, while the public accumulation in the mountainous area in 1958 only increased by 26% compared to 1957. From the perspective of the average accumulation per person, the average accumulation per person in the plain area in 1958 was 14.69 yuan, while the mountainous area only had 10.26 yuan, which was 43% higher in the plain area than in the mountainous area. The income level of commune members was 87.4 yuan per person in the plain area (excluding the supply part and the income from commune members' family sideline occupations, the same below), 79 yuan per person in the semi-mountainous area, and 57.7 yuan per person in the mountainous area. The income level of commune members in the plain area was 10.6% higher than that in the semi-mountainous area and 51.4% higher than that in the mountainous area. Therefore, vigorously developing a diversified economy, exploring natural resources, expanding public accumulation, increasing the income of commune members, and improving the material and cultural living standards of commune members are of extremely important significance.
	Fourth, developing a diversified economy can provide more commodities for the market, promote urban-rural economic cooperation, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. In 1958, the commune produced 3,916 dan of silkworm cocoons, 7,934 dan of tea, 1,118 dan of Atractylodes macrocephala, 114 tons of local paper, 270,40 dan of fresh fish, 20,412 dan of persimmons, 5,208 dan of water caltrop, 42,897 dan of bamboo shoots, 700 dan of蕉藕, 19.8 tons of starch, 87.4 tons of sauce, 5.6 tons of white wine, and 150,000 dan of vegetables. A large number of agricultural and sideline products have vigorously supported urban industrial production and the supply of non-staple foods, which is of great political significance for strengthening the economic ties between urban and rural areas and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

	The Superiority of People's Communes in Developing a Diversified Economy
	Although natural conditions have a certain impact on the development of a diversified economy, the full utilization of resources and the comprehensive development of production depend more on social conditions. Liuxia People's Commune has relatively good natural conditions, but in the era of advanced agricultural cooperatives, due to the small scale and limited human and material resources, the rich natural resources were not fully utilized. The people's commune has shown its great superiority in this regard, opening up a broad road for the most full and effective utilization of natural resources and the comprehensive development of production, and has played and is playing a huge role in developing a diversified economy. The superiority of the people's commune in this regard is mainly manifested in the following points:
	First, one of the biggest advantages of the commune over the advanced agricultural cooperative is its large organizational scale and wide range of activities. In production, it can make unified plans, so that the weak links in production can be developed accordingly. For example, in fishery production, Liuxia People's Commune did not have its own fish breeding farm in the past advanced agricultural cooperative, and there was a shortage of fish fry. It had to be purchased from distant places, and many outer ponds could not be used, and inner ponds were not fully utilized, which greatly affected the development of production and the increase of unit area yield. After the communization, a fish breeding farm was established, specializing in the cultivation of fish fry, expanding the area of outer ponds by more than 1,000 mu, strengthening the management of fish ponds, and accelerating the development of fishery production, so that fishery income accounted for 19.8% of the total agricultural output value, ranking second.
	In terms of developing animal husbandry, many production teams have established pig farms. For example, the pig farm of Yangjiapailou production team specializes in breeding piglets, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient supply of piglets, promoting the development of animal husbandry, and implementing the Party's policy of giving priority to collective breeding and simultaneously promoting collective and individual breeding. The animal husbandry industry has been greatly developed. Unified planning of land has enabled it to be rationally utilized, which is conducive to the development of a diversified economy. Originally, the tea land in this commune was scattered and inconvenient to manage. The commune carried out unified planning, zoned and operated in pieces, strengthened management, and greatly improved the unit area yield, which was 35% higher than in 1957.
	Originally, the rice area in this commune had a large area of paddy fields and few laborers, while the semi-mountainous area had a small area of paddy fields and more laborers. After the unified land planning, not only was the labor fully utilized and field management strengthened, but also the weak link of grain production in the semi-mountainous area was appropriately strengthened.
	In addition, most of the barren hills in the mountainous area have been afforested, and the cultivation and management of bamboo forests and fruit trees have been strengthened, which has played a significant role in the development of forestry production.
	Second, the commune can more effectively and fully mobilize and rationally arrange labor. This has a decisive effect on the development of production. In the past, advanced agricultural cooperatives had few laborers, and the potential of labor could not be fully utilized. The commune can uniformly mobilize and organize dozens of times more labor than the original advanced agricultural cooperatives, and make comprehensive arrangements for labor, so that the industrial and agricultural fronts, and the internal departments of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, all occupy appropriate proportions, so that a diversified economy can be comprehensively developed. For example, in the winter slack season of 1958, the commune uniformly organized thousands of laborers from the production team to go to the mountains to cut firewood and engage in sideline occupations, which increased the sideline income by 140,000 yuan in a very short period of time.
	The commune has established 95 public canteens, 167 nurseries, 116 kindergartens, one happiness home, and many laundry and sewing groups. The establishment of these collective welfare undertakings has freed women from household chores and directly participated in industrial and agricultural production and construction, generally increasing the labor force by 30%-40%, greatly overcoming the shortage of labor force.
	Third, communization provides favorable conditions for running industries. Under the policy of commune-run industries serving agriculture, they set up small-scale industries in accordance with local conditions, made full use of natural resources and agricultural by-products, and continuously expanded their business scope, realizing simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, which not only expanded public accumulation, but more importantly, directly promoted the development of agricultural production. The commune established 27 small blast furnaces in the national steelmaking campaign, producing 89 tons of iron. The more than 20 small factories run by the commune produced more than 3,790 tons of local fertilizer and more than 2,000 tons of local pesticides, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient fertilizer and pesticide supply. They produced more than 3 million pieces of blue bricks and refractory bricks, more than 2,000 tons of lime, and more than 19,000 tons of stone materials, supporting urban industrial construction; they manufactured 1,743 sets of bearings, basically realizing the bearingization of vehicles. In 1958, industrial production made a profit of 93,500 yuan, expanding public accumulation. Due to the development of commune-run industries, favorable conditions have been created for gradually realizing agricultural modernization, improving labor productivity, and changing the rural economy.

    一大二公便于发展多种经济
    ——浙江省杭州市留下人民公社发展多种经济调查
    中国农业科学院农业经济研究所  中国人民大学农业经济系  北京农业大学农业经济系调查组
                两年来的光辉成就
    留下人民公社位于杭州市西北郊区，1958年9月，由四十一个高级农业社和两个小集镇合并建成。
    公社南有高山，北是平川河塘，气候温和，土质肥沃，水源充足，工业矿藏资源亦相当丰富，有农、林、牧、副、渔综合发展极为有利的条件。
    1958年在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，各部门经济得到全面的跃进，工农业总产值达到六百七十八万八千四百三十二元，比1957年增长41.2％。农业取得了空前未有的大丰收，水稻平均亩产达到七百八十三斤，比1957年增长63％，茶叶亩产比1957年增长34.8％。农业总收入达到五百零四万九千八百零七元，比1957年增长14.5％，其中种植业收入占农业总收入的50.8％，比1957年增长14.2％，茶叶占总收入12.8％，比1957年增长12％，蚕桑占总收入10.2％，比1957年增长20％，渔业占总收入19.8％，比1957年增长31％，畜牧业占总收入1.3％，比1957年增长252％，林业占总收入0.2％，其他副业占总收入4.9％。经济收入的增长，增加了社员收入，提高了社员物质生活水平。
    在社办工业方面，公社成立后像雨后春笋一样发展起来，建立了土化肥厂、农具修配制造厂、农副产品加工厂、竹制品厂、木器厂、造纸厂、纤维厂和煤球厂等二十余个。经过1959年的整顿，合并为七个小型工厂。1958年工业总产值一百七十三万八千六百二十五元，占工农业总产值的25％。工业生产的发展，不仅支援了农业生产的全面发展和城市工业建设，为市场供应了大量的商品，繁荣了城乡经济，更重要的是为逐步实现公社工业化、农业机械化与电气化迈开前进的步伐。
    继1958年工农业生产的全面大跃进，今年上半年的工农业生产又获得了空前的跃进。今年上半年工业总产值一百一十四万元，比去年同期增长二点二倍，超额完成计划的101.6％，农业总产值达二百三十万元，比去年同期增长14.6％，而且农、林、牧、副、渔多种经济都获得全面增产。早稻单位产量比去年增产30.2％，油菜籽增产63％，蚕豆增产22％，小麦增产9％，林业收入比去年同期增加24.7％，副业收入增加106.7％，渔业增加142.43％，春夏蚕也相应的增产。畜牧饲养业，由于正确地贯彻了党中央所提出的集体饲养为主，集体饲养与私人饲养并举的方针，也有着很大的发展，猪达到五千五百头，羊一万零六百头，家禽四万只，兔二千九百五十只。
              统一筹划因地制宜
    留下人民公社，根据经济收入构成的特点，可分为三个不同经济区。即以粮为主，茶叶次之的山区；以茶叶为主，粮食次之的半山区；以粮食为主，渔、蚕桑次之的平原区。各经济区由于自然资源和社会经济基础的不同，生产和社员生活水平有较大的差异。详见下表：
    1958年留下人民公社各经济区部门经济收入比重
    山区：包括原来的八个高级农业社，农户占全社总农户的18.24％。山地约占土地总面积的80％，耕地仅占10％，木材、竹林资源丰富。过去农民以砍柴、造纸和竹器生产来谋生，农作物栽培很少，在零星坡地上种点薯类。粮食主要依靠外地供应，畜牧业没有发展起来。解放后逐步改变这种落后面貌，首先重视了粮食和茶叶生产的发展，修复了旧有耕地，扩大了播种面积，使种植业和茶叶收入迅速增长；同时畜牧业也得到了一定的发展。1958年种植业收入已占总收入55.05％，茶叶跃居第二位，这就根本改变过去粮食主要依靠外援的状况。生产的迅速发展不断地增加了社员收入，提高了社员生活水平。
    半山区：包括原来的六个高级农业社，农户占总农户的15.92％。地势多为丘陵，平原很少，作物单一，以茶叶生产为主，1958年茶叶生产占总收入53.17％，其次是种植业收入占32.70％，副业生产有着相当的地位，占总收入的11.30％，唯畜牧业不发达。茶叶生产有着悠久的历史，一般产量高，质量好，如杨家牌楼生产队，茶叶平均亩产二百四十一斤，比全社茶叶平均亩产高一倍。社员生活水平亦较高，1958年社员每人平均收入较山区多30％。今后如能大力发展畜牧业和组织其它副业生产，将会促进多种经济更全面发展。
    平原区：包括原来二十七个高级社，农户占总农户的65.84％。全区河塘交错，两岸桑果成荫，水田土质肥沃，水源充足，便于灌溉，历来盛产粮食、鲜鱼、竹笋、柿子。自然资源富饶。1958年渔业收入占总收入的25.73％，仅次于种植业收入。由于多种经济发展比较均衡，生产的总收入比较高，社员的收入水平亦高，1958年平均每人收入九十二元，比山区每人平均收入多61％，比半山区多24％，比1957年增长了8.2％。这个地区在解放前经济作物较发达，而粮食生产少，反映了小农经济单一的生产。解放后在党的正确领导下，随着集体所有制在农村中建立和发展，很快地扭转了过去重经济作物、轻粮食生产的片面性，使粮食生产和其他部门得到更快的发展。除耕地面积扩大以外，并改进耕作制度，迅速地提高了单位面积产量。
    发展多种经济的优越性表现在以下几个方面：
    首先，它可以合理地、均衡地利用劳动力。根据不同经济类型区几个典型生产队的调查情况证明，由于多种经济发展水平的差异，劳动力的使用程度和均衡性有着显著的不同，见下表：
    五四、屏峰、深增口三个队全年各月份用工构成％
    从表中各队全年用工情况来看，“五四”队因作物单一，以水稻为主，茶叶次之，全年用工比较集中在4—7月份，此时，正是插秧抢收和采茶叶季节，故需用工最多，在10—11月上旬是单季稻收刈期和春花抢种季节，用工亦较多，其他各月，需用工很少。全年平均每月用工悬殊很大，最高需工量为最低的一十三点七三倍。屏峰队以茶叶为主，水稻次之。用工情况与“五四”队相似，全年有两个高峰，即3月底到8月初，10月底到11月初，用工季节性亦很显著，最高为最低的三十一点零六倍。深增口队经营部门较多，除水稻外，有蚕桑、鱼塘、果树等，全年用工量虽然在3—7月、10—11月初比较多，但各月份的用工量比较均衡，最高用工量为最低的二点五倍，与前二者比较，用工量比较均衡，因而调节了农业生产上劳动力使用的季节性。
    发展多种经济可以充分合理地利用劳力，挖掘劳动资源，提高劳动生产率，为社会创造出更多的物质财富。从公社各个经济类型每人平均所创造的价值来看，证明了多种经济发展较好的队，劳动力利用率高，创造的价值亦多。以上述三个典型队为例：“五四”队每个劳力全年创造价值二百九十六元，屏峰队创造三百四十九元，深增口队就创造三百五十一元，较“五四”队多18.5％。
    杨家牌楼队，为充分合理地利用劳力，组织了副业组，其中等外劳力和残疾者占50％，全组的平均年龄在五十岁以上。由于按照各人的技能分别进行编土箕、竹篮等竹器生产，平均每人每天创造价值二点五元，纯收入达一点五元。这样一个人可抵上一个整劳力，但如果把他们分配做农活，三个也抵不上一个整劳动力。
    第二，发展多种经济，可以充分利用自然资源，各经营部门之间，可以相互配合与支援，有利于生产的发展。从农业本身来说，要求各部门之间密切的配合和支援，使整个农业生产跃进。如深增口生产队将塘泥掘在堤边的桑地上，使桑叶增了产，桑叶的增产保证了养蚕业的发展，而蚕粪是很好的肥料，又是很好的饲料，可用来喂鱼、喂羊，而羊粪既是肥料又可当鱼饵，鱼粪又可增加塘泥的肥分，这个队1959年水稻春化共需塘泥五十五万七千九百担，人工一万八千五百个，如折成人粪肥需款二万七千九百八十四元，就地利用了塘泥，每亩稻田可降低成本37％。
    各生产部门之间的配合还表现在资金周转快，及时解决了生产上的需要。山区和半山区，在茶叶、粮食收获以前现金收入少，在春耕施肥和每月发工资时，都感到现金周转的困难。但平原区经济作物和副业生产现金收入多，周转较快，调节了全年的生产费用和工资开支。
    公社工业建立后，也有力地支援了农业生产。公社水稻面积较多，过去稻草当作燃料，建立了造纸厂后，用稻草造纸，使它利用更加合理。建立了农副产品加工厂，把薯类加工制造淀粉，残渣经酿酒后再作猪饲料，稻糠酿酒后糠渣又可喂猪等等。农业副产品和工业副产品的相互利用，促进了工业生产，而同时又为发展畜牧业提供了大量的饲料，加速了农业的发展。建立了土化肥厂，利用当地骨头、蚌壳、磷矿石、焦泥炭、硝土等原料，生产土化肥三千七百九十多吨，支援了农业生产。诸如此类的多种经营，挖掘和合理利用了自然资源，促进了生产部门之间相互支援和全面发展。
    第三，发展多种经济可以扩大公共积累，增加社员收入。各部门经济的综合性发展，使自然资源和劳动力得到充分而合理的利用，因此多种经济生产较好的地区，创造了更多的财富，扩大了公共积累，增加了社员收入，如平原区1958年公共积累比1957年增长147.2％，而山区1958年公共积累比1957年仅增长26％，从每人平均积累额来看，1958年平原区每人平均积累十四点六九元，山区仅有十点二六元，平原区比山区高43％。社员的收入水平，平原区每人平均收入八十七点四元（供给部分和社员家庭副业收入除外，以下同），半山区每人平均收入七十九元，山区每人平均收入五十七点七元，平原区社员收入水平比半山区高10.6％，比山区高51.4％。因此大力发展多种经济，挖掘自然资源，扩大公共积累，增加社员收入，提高社员物质和文化生活水平，是有着极其重要的意义。
    第四，发展多种经济可以为市场提供更多的商品，促进城乡经济合作，巩固工农联盟。1958年公社生产了蚕茧三千九百一十六担，茶叶七千九百三十四担，白术一千一百一十八担，土纸一百一十四吨，鲜鱼二十七万零四担，柿子二万零四百一十二担，菱五千二百零八担，竹笋四万二千八百九十七担，蕉藕七百担，淀粉十九点八吨，酱八十七点四吨，白酒五点六吨，蔬菜十五万担。大量的农副产品，有力地支援了城市工业生产和副食品的供应，对加强城乡经济的联系和巩固工农联盟有着重要的政治意义。
        人民公社在发展多种经济中的优越性
    自然条件对发展多种经济，虽有一定的影响，但资源的充分利用，生产的全面发展，更重要的是取决于社会条件。留下人民公社自然条件比较好，可是高级农业社时，由于规模小，人力物力有限，富饶的自然资源并没有得到充分的利用。人民公社化就在这方面表现了它的巨大优越性，为最充分而有效地利用自然资源，全面发展生产，开辟了广阔的道路，对发展多种经济起了和正在起着巨大的作用。人民公社在这方面的优越性，主要表现在以下几点：
    第一，公社比高级农业社最大的优点之一，就是它的组织规模大，活动范围广，在生产上能够统一筹划，使生产上薄弱的环节，得到相应的发展。例如渔业生产，留下人民公社在过去高级农业社时，都没有自己的鱼种场，鱼苗缺乏，要到很远的外地采购，很多外塘不能利用，内塘亦没有充分利用起来，在发展生产和提高单位面积产量上，受着很大的影响。公社化后，建立了鱼种场，专门培养鱼苗，扩大了外塘面积一千多亩，加强了鱼塘管理，加速了渔业生产的发展，使渔业收入在农业总产值中占19.8％，居于第二位。
    在发展畜牧业方面，许多生产队，建立了养猪场，如杨家牌楼生产队的猪场，专门繁殖仔猪，克服了仔猪供应不足的困难，促进了畜牧业的发展，贯彻执行了党的以集体饲养为主，集体和个人喂养同时并举的两条腿走路方针，畜牧业得到了很大的发展。统一规划了土地，使它得到合理利用，有利于多种经济的发展。原来这个社茶地零星分散，不便管理，公社进行统一规划，分区分片经营，加强了管理，大大地提高了单位面积产量，比1957年提高了35％。
    原来这个社的水稻区水田面积较多，劳力少，而半山区水田面积少，劳动力较多，经过土地统一规划后，不仅充分利用了劳力，加强了田间管理，同时也适当地加强了半山区粮食生产的薄弱环节。
    此外，山区荒山大部绿化起来，加强了竹林、果木林的培育管理，在林业生产的发展上起了重大的作用。
    第二，公社可以更有效地充分动员和合理安排劳动力。这对发展生产有着决定性的作用。过去高级农业社，劳力少，而且劳动潜力不能充分发挥。公社可以统一调动和组织比原来高级农业社多数十倍的劳动力，对劳力进行了全面安排，使工农业战线，农、林、牧、副、渔内部，都占有适当的比例，使多种经济能够全面地发展。如在1958年冬闲时，公社统一组织了生产队几千名劳动力，上山打柴搞副业，在很短的时间里，就增加副业收入十四万元。
    公社建立了公共食堂九十五个，办了托儿所一百六十七个，幼儿园一百一十六个，幸福院一个，还有许多洗衣缝纫组。兴办这些集体福利事业，使妇女解除了家庭事务劳动，直接参加了工农业生产建设，一般增加了劳动力30％—40％，大大地克服了劳动力不足现象。
    第三，公社化后为兴办工业提供了有利条件。他们在社办工业为农业服务的方针下，因地制宜地兴办小型工业，充分利用自然资源和农业副产品，不断扩大经营范围，实现了工农业同时并举，不但扩大了公共积累，更重要的是直接促进了农业生产的发展。公社在全民炼钢运动中，建立了二十七个小高炉，生产了铁八十九吨，公社兴办的二十余个小型工厂生产了土化肥三千七百九十多吨，土农药二千多吨，克服了肥料和农药供应不足的困难，生产了青红砖、耐火砖三百多万块，石灰二千多吨，石料一万九千多吨，支援了城市工业建设；制造了轴承一千七百四十三套，基本上实现了车子轴承化。1958年工业生产获得利润九万三千五百元，扩大了公共积累。由于社办工业的发展，为逐步实现农业现代化，提高劳动生产率，改变农村经济面貌，创造了有利条件。
