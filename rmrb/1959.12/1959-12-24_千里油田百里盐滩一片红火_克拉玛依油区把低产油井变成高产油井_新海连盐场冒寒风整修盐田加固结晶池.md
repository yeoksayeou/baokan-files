Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 21st: The Karamay mining area is focusing on improving crude oil production levels to ensure a flying start to production next year.

The main measures taken by the mining area are: to transform low-yielding oil wells into high-yielding oil wells within the year; to repair closed-down oil wells, and to exploit shallow oil layer oilfields at the same time. Since mid-November, the oil production department has scheduled the oil wells to be repaired according to time plans and is carrying out repairs. Hydraulic fracturing is used to increase the output of low-yield oil wells, and the daily output of oil wells after fracturing has generally increased by more than two times. In addition, measures such as simultaneous oil extraction in two oil layers, strengthening water injection in oil fields, and increasing the drilling of new wells are being taken. After these measures are completed, crude oil production in January next year can be greatly increased.

The equipment that needs to be overhauled in the mining area has been scheduled by various departments and carried out in stages. Most of the equipment is being repaired without stopping production. The spare parts needed for drilling and oil transportation equipment have been manufactured by the mining area's machine repair factory. Various departments are adopting methods such as on-the-job training, on-site training, and one master with multiple apprentices, and are training more than a thousand skilled workers for next year's production. By the end of the year, ten sets of drilling equipment can be equipped, and ten drilling teams can be established. The transportation department is also trying its best to tap the potential to transport steel, cement, barite and other materials needed for next year's production. The five major projects to be carried out in the first quarter of the oilfield's basic construction have begun winter construction preparations. These projects include the expansion project of the oil refinery and the construction of the third oil pipeline to the railway station.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: A busy scene is unfolding on the hundred-li Xin Hailian Saltworks on the coast of the Yellow Sea. All the workers of the saltworks brave the biting cold wind and work enthusiastically to prepare for next year's production to ensure a flying start to production next year.

After completing this year's salt production plan ahead of schedule, the saltworks initially determined next year's production plan. The Party Committee of the saltworks launched workers to speak out and debate, criticized the slack mood of a few people after completing the annual plan, and made it clear that doing a good job of preparatory work before the end of the year is an important key to ensuring continued leap forward next year, and determined to complete the task of brine production for 248,959 ponds, providing raw materials for next year's production.

More than 2,000 people were organized throughout the saltworks to comprehensively renovate the salt fields, level the evaporation ponds, and reinforce the crystallization ponds. At present, thousands of crystallization ponds and evaporation ponds have been renovated. The renovated ponds are smooth and hard, and the evaporation capacity has been greatly improved, creating favorable conditions for rapid brine production and salt production next year.

For old-style salt fields, thorough renovations are being carried out in a planned and focused manner. The salt workers replaced the original mud pond bottom of the crystallization pond with crushed stone and sand, paving and compacting it. Workers in the Taipei No. 1 work area have worked hard for more than ten days and have replaced the bottom of more than one hundred crystallization ponds with stone and sand, which means salt can be planted one day earlier each time after it rains.

The workers are also working hard to accelerate the construction of new salt fields and pumping stations. New salt fields and pumping stations will be put into production one after another by the end of this year and next year.

　　千里油田百里盐滩一片红火
    克拉玛依油区把低产油井变成高产油井
    新海连盐场冒寒风整修盐田加固结晶池
    据新华社克拉玛依21日电　克拉玛依矿区紧抓提高原油生产水平，保证明年生产开门红。
    矿区采取的主要措施是：在年内把低产油井变成高产油井；修复停产的油井，同时开采浅油层油田。从11月中旬开始，采油部门已把要修复的油井按时间排定计划，进行修复。对低产油井采取压裂法增加产量，压裂后的油井日产量一般都增加了两倍以上。另外，还采取在两个油层同时采油，加强油田注水和增钻新井等措施，这些措施完成后，可以使明年1月份原油产量大大提高。
    矿区需要检修的设备，各部门已排定计划分期进行。大部分设备是在不停产的情况下进行维修的。钻井和输油等设备需要的配件，已由矿区机修厂开始制造。各部门采取脱产训练，现场练兵，一师多徒等办法，正在为明年生产培训一千多名技术工人，到年底即可配好十套钻井设备，成立十个井队。运输部门也正千方百计挖掘潜力运输明年生产需要的钢材、水泥、重晶石等器材。第一季度油田基本建设要进行的五大工程，已开始作冬季施工准备。这些工程包括炼油厂扩建工程以及新建通往火车站的第三条输油管线等。
    新华社南京22日电　在黄海之滨的百里新海连盐场上，呈现出一片繁忙景象。全场职工冒着刺骨的寒风，热火朝天地为明年的生产作准备，保证明年生产开门红。
    这个盐场在提前完成今年产盐计划后，初步确定了明年的生产计划。盐场党委发动职工鸣放辩论，批判了少数人的在完成全年计划后的松劲情绪，明确了在年前做好准备工作，是保证明年实现继续跃进的一个重要关键，决心完成二四八九五九塘制卤任务，为明年的生产提供原料。
    全场还组织了两千多人全面地整修盐田，平整蒸发池和加固结晶池，目前已经整修好上千块结晶池、蒸发池，整修过的池子，块块光滑、坚硬，蒸发能力大大提高，为明年快速制卤和产盐创造了有利条件。
    对于旧式盐田，正在有计划、有重点地彻底改造。盐工们把结晶池原来的泥池板底，改用碎石砂子铺平压实。台北一工区的工人，奋战十多天，已经把一百多块结晶池的板底改铺成石砂子板，每次下过雨就可以提早一天种盐。
    职工们还努力加速新盐田和扬水站的建设，今年年底和明年都将有新盐田和扬水站陆续投入生产。
