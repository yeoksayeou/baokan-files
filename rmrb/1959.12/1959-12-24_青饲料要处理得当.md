　　Green Fodder Must Be Properly Handled
    Using green fodder to feed pigs is a good method. If green fodder is utilized properly, pigs will grow faster and fatten faster. If handled improperly, fodder poisoning will occur (in some places it is called "bao shao wen"). Some green fodder, especially deteriorated green fodder, often contains a toxic substance - hydrocyanic acid. After pigs are poisoned by hydrocyanic acid, they will suffer from abdominal pain, rapid breathing, and restlessness. If not rescued quickly, they will suffocate and die. Green fodder containing toxins must be thoroughly cooked. Before cooking green fodder, boil the water first, then wash and chop the green fodder before putting it in. The heat should be high when cooking, and it should be cooked thoroughly. Putting green fodder into a pot of boiling water without adding heat, or only cooking it until it is half-cooked, will still cause the fodder to deteriorate and produce hydrocyanic acid.
    The pot for cooking green fodder or the buckets and vats for storing the fodder should be opened to allow some of the hydrocyanic acid to escape. After the fodder is cooked, it is best to immediately pour it into other vats or buckets to cool it quickly. Leaving it in the pot unattended can also easily cause it to deteriorate and become toxic. Green fodder is best cooked and fed immediately.
    What to do in case of fodder poisoning? If pigs are found to be poisoned, you can immediately use folk remedies such as cutting the tail or ears to let out blood, pouring cold water on the pig's head and chest, or giving the pig sour water (sour vegetable water, acetic acid, etc.), which can also have some effect.

### 青饲料要处理得当

　　青饲料要处理得当
    利用青绿饲料喂猪是个好办法。青绿饲料利用得当，猪吃了长得快，肥得快；如果处理不当，就会发生饲料中毒现象（有的地方叫饱潲瘟）。有些青绿饲料，特别是变质的青绿饲料常常含有一种有毒物质——氢氰酸。猪中了氢氰酸的毒以后腹痛、呼吸急促、时卧时起，如不迅速抢救，就会窒息死亡。含有毒素的青绿饲料一定要煮熟煮透。在煮青绿饲料前要先把水烧开，把青绿饲料洗好、切好再放进去。煮的时候火力要大，煮熟、煮透。把青绿饲料放到开水锅里不加火，或者是只煮到半生、半熟，这样仍会引起饲料变质，产生氢氰酸。
    煮青绿饲料的锅或装饲料的桶和缸，应该打开盖子，以便于氢氰酸散出一些。饲料煮熟后，最好立即倒入其他缸、桶里，使其很快冷却。放在锅里不管，也容易发生变质生毒。青饲料最好现煮现喂。
    发生饲料中毒怎样办？发现猪中毒，可以立即采用剪尾、剪耳放血等土法抢救，向猪的头部、胸部泼冷水，或者给猪灌酸水（酸菜水、醋酸等），也有一定效果。
