    Both Overhaul and Innovate
    Li Fu
    In the preparation for next year's production, equipment overhaul is a very important component. "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." Grasping the opportunity to overhaul equipment well will create favorable conditions for next year's "good start" and the continued leap forward in production throughout the year.
    The improvement of productivity depends on the improvement of people's production skills and the normal operation and continuous improvement of machines. If machines cannot maintain normal operation and equipment cannot maintain good performance, production cannot proceed normally, and of course, there can be no comprehensive leap forward in quantity, speed, quality, economy, and safety. People need to pay attention to hygiene and prevent diseases; if they are sick, they need timely medical treatment, otherwise it will damage their health and endanger their lives. The same is true for machines. If they are not maintained regularly, accidents are likely to occur. If minor illnesses are not treated, they will turn into major illnesses and even become unmanageable. This is detrimental to national property and the continued leap forward in production.
    Now, many factories and mines are seizing the time to overhaul equipment while completing this year's production tasks, which is entirely appropriate and necessary. The Shandong Provincial Electric Power Industry System has proposed to overhaul all the equipment that should be overhauled before the end of the year, arrange pre-year overhaul projects, and do everything possible to ensure completion, which is an effective measure to ensure a "good start" in the first quarter of next year. If all factories and enterprises complete the overhaul of equipment that should be overhauled this year, they can go into production at full capacity as soon as they enter next year. However, some people still put equipment overhaul in opposition to completing production tasks, and they don't overhaul when they should, thinking that this can increase some output. They do not realize that this short-sighted approach is "penny-wise and pound-foolish." First, over time, equipment will inevitably fail. Failures that could have been prevented were not prevented, and what was originally a minor illness turned into a major illness. Stopping production for repairs at this time will inevitably take more time and cause greater losses to production. Second, if you do not pay attention to maintenance, the equipment will lose its precision, which will reduce the quality of the product and make it prone to accidents. Third, if the overhaul is not carried out according to plan, a hasty rush will disrupt the production plan when "the fire is burning eyebrows." Therefore, equipment overhaul must be carried out according to plan, and the timing of the overhaul must not be missed, otherwise it will be like nurturing a malignant tumor.
    How to carry out the overhaul? Is it enough to just repair, replace, wipe, and oil? Or should we take a creative attitude and take advantage of this favorable opportunity to reform the machinery and equipment so that it can "reach a higher level"? We believe that the Shanghai Cold-Rolled Strip Steel Plant's practice of small overhauls and small innovations, and large overhauls and large innovations, is a good experience worth promoting. First of all, they have a spirit of continuous revolution, are not satisfied with the status quo of machines and production functions, are good at reforming them in response to their weaknesses, and actively innovate in overhauls to improve the efficiency of machines. If this kind of thinking is used to overhaul machinery and equipment, then they will not be satisfied with "it's good enough if the machine doesn't have an accident"; on the contrary, they will regard equipment overhaul as the best opportunity for technical reform, killing two birds with one stone, treating both the symptoms and the root cause. In this way, with each overhaul, the efficiency of the machine and the level of production will be improved, and the old machine will become younger and more powerful as it is repaired and reformed. If more factories and enterprises use this method to overhaul equipment and prepare for next year's production, then will the production level of these factories next year not certainly exceed this year's?
    Equipment overhaul takes time. Now that the end of the year is approaching, time is even more precious. We must seize all favorable opportunities, make full preparations, shorten the overhaul period, and improve the quality of the overhaul.

    又检修又革新
    黎夫
    在明年的生产准备中，设备检修是一项很重要的内容。“工欲善其事，必先利其器”，抓紧时机把设备检修好，就能为明年的“开门红”和全年生产的继续跃进创造有利条件。
    生产力的提高，依靠人的生产技能的提高和机器的正常运转与不断改善。机器不能经常保持正常运转，设备不能保持良好性能，生产也就不可能正常进行，当然也谈不到多、快、好、省、安全的全面跃进。人需要讲究卫生，预防疾病；有病需及时医疗，不然就要损害健康，危及生命。机器也是如此，平时不保养，容易出事故，得了小病不医治，就会变成大病，甚至不可收拾。这对国家财产、对生产的继续跃进，都是不利的。
    现在，许多厂矿在完成今年生产任务的同时，抓紧设备的检修，是完全适时的、必要的。山东省电力工业系统提出年前将应检修的设备全部检修好，安排年前的检修项目，千方百计保证完成，是确保明年第一季度“开门红”的有效措施。如果所有厂矿企业对于该在今年检修好的设备，都在今年检修完毕，那么一进入明年就可以开足马力投入生产。但是，还有人把检修设备与完成生产任务对立起来，该检修不检修，以为这样可以增加一些产量。殊不知这种只顾眼前的作法，是“得不偿失”的。第一、长此以往，设备必然发生故障，本来可以防止的故障没有防止，本来是小病结果酿成大病，这时再停止生产去修理，势必用去更多的时间，使生产受到更大的损失。第二、不注意维修，设备失去了精密度，就会使产品质量下降，同时容易发生事故。第三、检修不按计划进行，到了“火烧眉睫”的时候仓皇突击，就会打乱生产的计划。由此可见，设备检修一定要按计划进行，该检修的万不可错过时机，养痈成患。
    怎样进行检修呢？是修修配配擦擦油就完了呢？还是以创造性的态度，趁此有利时机改革机器设备，使它“更上一层楼”呢？我们认为上海冷轧带钢厂小检修小革新，大检修大革新的作法，是值得推广的好经验。他们首先有着一种不断革命的思想，不满足于机器的现状和生产功能，善于针对它的弱点改造它，在检修中积极地革新，提高机器的效能。用这种思想来检修机器设备，那就不会满足于“机器不发生事故就算了”；相反，把检修设备看成技术改革的最好时机，一箭双雕，治标又治本。这样，每检修一次，机器效率和生产水平就提高一步，老机器越修越年轻，越改越有力。如果更多的工厂企业用这种方法来检修设备，来为明年的生产作准备，那么，这些工厂明年的生产水平不是一定会超过今年吗？
    检修设备需要时间。现在年关临近，时间更为宝贵，我们要抓紧一切有利时机，做好充分的准备，把检修的工期缩得更短，把检修的质量提得更高。
