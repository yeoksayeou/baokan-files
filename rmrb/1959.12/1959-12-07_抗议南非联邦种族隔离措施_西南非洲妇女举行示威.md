Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Windhoek dispatch: Hundreds of African women in Southwest Africa held a demonstration on the 4th to protest the implementation of apartheid policies there by the white authorities of the South African Federation. Four women leaders were arrested.

These African women protested against the South African authorities' plan to move them from Windhoek to a newly built non-white town (Katatura) nearby. According to this plan, Africans moving from their current mud huts and tin shacks to this non-white town would have to pay more than ten times the current hut tax.

Southwest Africa was occupied by the South African Federation in 1915. After World War I, it was mandated to the South African Federation by the League of Nations. In April 1949, the South African Federation, disregarding the opposition of the people of Southwest Africa, passed the so-called "Southwest Africa Affairs Amendment Act," effectively annexing Southwest Africa.

    抗议南非联邦种族隔离措施
    西南非洲妇女举行示威
    新华社5日讯　温得和克消息：西南非洲数百名非洲妇女在4日举行示威，抗议南非联邦白人当局在那里执行种族隔离政策。有四个妇女领袖被捕。
    这些非洲妇女抗议南非当局把她们从温得和克迁移到附近一个新建的非白人城镇（卡塔图拉）的计划。根据这个计划，非洲人从目前的泥土茅屋和铁皮棚户迁到这个非白人城镇去，就要比现在多交纳十倍多的茅屋税。
    西南非洲在1915年被南非联邦占领。第一次世界大战后曾由国际联盟委任南非联邦统治。1949年4月，南非联邦不顾西南非洲人民的反对，通过所谓“西南非洲事务修正法案”，实际上吞并了西南非洲。
