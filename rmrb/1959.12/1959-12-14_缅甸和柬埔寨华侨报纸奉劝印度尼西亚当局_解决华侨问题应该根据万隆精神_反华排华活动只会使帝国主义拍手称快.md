Xinhua News Agency, December 13th dispatch from Rangoon: Burmese Overseas Chinese newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial on November 4th, strongly condemning the US imperialists for colluding with the reactionary forces in Indonesia to sow discord and conspire to undermine the friendly relations between Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people. The editorial pointed out that this is part of the US imperialists' conspiracy to be hostile to the new China.
	“People’s Daily” said that banning Overseas Chinese petty traders is detrimental to the local national economy.
	The editorial pointed out that the recent anti-Chinese measures taken by the Indonesian authorities will greatly affect the lives of Overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia, seriously threatening their right to survival.
	The editorial then refuted the claim that there is a "fierce competition" between Overseas Chinese petty traders and the Indonesian national economy. The editorial pointed out that the capital of Overseas Chinese petty traders in Indonesia is generally very small. They work diligently from dawn till dusk, and the price they pay is only to maintain their family's life. These petty traders are obviously not in a major position in Indonesia's entire business sector and will not have "fierce competition" with the local national economy. This is completely different in nature from the situation where imperialist monopoly capital from the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, and other countries manipulates the Indonesian economy and plunders high profits. The editorial pointed out that instead of taking necessary measures to deal with these imperialist monopoly enterprises, the Indonesian authorities are attempting to prohibit the traditional business operations of Overseas Chinese petty traders. This approach of abandoning the fundamental for the superficial is not only not beneficial to the development of the Indonesian national economy, but on the contrary, will affect the prosperity of the national economy.
	This newspaper hopes that the Indonesian authorities will take appropriate measures to implement the spirit of the joint communiqué recently issued by the Chinese and Indonesian foreign ministers, strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries, and prevent the imperialists' tricks of sowing discord from succeeding.
	"New Rangoon Daily" said that it is necessary to quickly stop anti-Chinese activities and be vigilant against imperialist conspiracies.
	The "New Rangoon Daily" also published an editorial on November 4th, calling on the Indonesian government to stop anti-Chinese activities and resolve the Overseas Chinese issue in accordance with the spirit of the joint communiqué of the two foreign ministers, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.
	The editorial pointed out that the economic power of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia has always belonged to the category of the Indonesian national economy and has not formed its own system. If it is used well, it can make due contributions to the local economy. On the contrary, the monopoly capital of colonial countries controls the economic lifeline of Indonesia, causing the local people and Overseas Chinese to suffer the same exploitation. Therefore, the main way out for the Indonesian economy is to cooperate with Overseas Chinese to resist the large-scale plunder of colonialists, rather than excluding Overseas Chinese petty traders who contribute to connecting the urban and rural economies of Indonesia.
	The editorial refuted the imperialist's slander that Overseas Chinese are a "fifth column" and that the Overseas Chinese economy is a "remnant of colonialism." The editorial pointed out that Overseas Chinese are only trying to make a living abroad and have no colonialist nature whatsoever. They abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and do not interfere in the politics of their country of residence. The editorial condemned the US imperialists for spreading the above slanders to provoke anti-Chinese conspiracies.
	The "New Rangoon Daily" published another editorial on November 20th, calling for a quick stop to the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia. The newspaper refuted the argument of forcibly portraying Overseas Chinese petty traders as "monopoly capitalists." It pointed out that this statement is a case of mistaken identity. There is indeed a very large amount of foreign capital in Indonesia that monopolizes the local important resources, but the owners of these monopoly capital are Western imperialists.
	The newspaper pointed out that the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia are developing more and more seriously, and the imperialists are still inciting and sowing discord. The editorial called for an immediate stop to anti-Chinese activities and for the Overseas Chinese issue to be resolved in accordance with the spirit of the joint communiqué between the Chinese and Indonesian foreign ministers.
	"Life Weekly" Asian countries should be friendly, imperialism is the common enemy.
	"Life Weekly," published in Rangoon, published a commentary on November 8th, pointing out that China and Indonesia are friendly Asian countries and are both threatened by US imperialism. Only by uniting with each other can the two countries repel the attacks of imperialism. If it goes against the Bandung principles, it will precisely fall into the trap of the US imperialists to undermine the unity of the Asian people in order to defeat them one by one. The commentary called on the Indonesian side to immediately stop anti-Chinese activities and resolve the Overseas Chinese issue fairly and reasonably through friendly consultation.
	Xinhua News Agency, December 13th dispatch from Phnom Penh: Cambodian Overseas Chinese newspapers recently published commentaries, expressing regret and concern about the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia, and hoping that the Indonesian government will take the friendly relations between the two countries as important and handle the Overseas Chinese issue in accordance with the spirit of the joint communiqué of the Chinese and Indonesian foreign ministers.
	"Mian Hua Daily" Based on the Bandung Spirit, the Overseas Chinese issue is not difficult to solve.
	"Mian Hua Daily" said in a commentary published on November 20th that Overseas Chinese living in Indonesia have always participated in local construction with their intelligent minds and hardworking hands. The diligence and simplicity of Overseas Chinese have always been praised by the people of their country of residence, and even colonialists have to admit the contribution of Overseas Chinese to local construction. The commentary pointed out that the hindered economic development of Indonesia is only the result of colonialists controlling its economic lifeline and looting its economic resources.
	The newspaper pointed out that the Indonesian authorities' practice of prohibiting Overseas Chinese petty traders from doing business below the county level and forcing Overseas Chinese to relocate is obviously unrelated to the issue of safeguarding Indonesia's national interests. The commentary said that there is no fundamental contradiction between Overseas Chinese in Indonesia and the local people.
	The newspaper believes that it is inconceivable to separate the Overseas Chinese issue from the issue of relations between Indonesia and China. It said that the Chinese government has always educated Overseas Chinese to abide by laws and regulations, but it must also protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese. The newspaper went on to say that friendship is mutual, not one-sided. It should be based on the reasonable resolution of disputes between the two sides.
	The newspaper said, "China's enemy is the imperialists, Indonesia's enemy is also the imperialists, and both countries must safeguard national independence. Since both countries have common enemies and common goals, coupled with the foundation of maintaining relations between the two countries based on the Bandung Spirit, what unsolvable problems are there between the two countries?!"
	The newspaper published a reader's letter on November 13th. In the letter, the reader talked about the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia and said, "This is a conspiracy of the colonialists. They are trying to provoke ill feelings between the local ethnic groups and Overseas Chinese so that they can profit from it." The reader pointed out that if the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia continue, it will only please the imperialists.
	"Mian Hua Daily" published another commentary on November 29th, stating that Overseas Chinese in Indonesia have made indelible contributions to Indonesia's development and are also playing a beneficial role in Indonesia's economic development today. Their legitimate rights and interests in Indonesia are protected by the Chinese government and should also be respected by the Indonesian government.
	The newspaper said that the Indonesian authorities said that they cannot harm the friendship between Indonesia and China, but they are persecuting Chinese expatriates and treating the joint communiqué of the foreign ministers of the two countries as waste paper, ignoring the protests of the Chinese government. The newspaper asked: Is this the attitude that should be taken to respect the friendship between the two countries?
	"Industrial and Commercial Daily" Anti-Chinese activities have a hundred harms and no benefits, wise politicians should be vigilant.
	In a commentary on November 20th, the "Industrial and Commercial Daily" refuted the claim that the Overseas Chinese economy is a so-called "remnant of colonialism" that is detrimental to Indonesia. The commentary said that Overseas Chinese petty traders abide by local laws, fulfill their tax obligations, and also supply the people with material needs and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. It can be seen that Overseas Chinese petty traders are only beneficial to the local economic prosperity and have no harm. The joint communiqué issued by Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio and Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi also believes that the economic power of Overseas Chinese will continue to play a beneficial role in Indonesia's economic development. The newspaper pointed out that what really hinders the development of the (Indonesian) national economy are colonialists and monopoly capitalists.
	The newspaper accused the Indonesian military police of forcing Overseas Chinese to relocate and beating Overseas Chinese. It said that this rude behavior violated the principle of respecting basic human rights in the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.
	The newspaper hopes that the Indonesian authorities can handle the Overseas Chinese issue in accordance with the spirit of the joint communiqué of the Chinese and Indonesian foreign ministers. It said that doing so will not only allow Overseas Chinese to live and work in peace and contentment, but also allow Indonesia's economy to maintain stability.
	In a commentary published on November 3rd, the "Industrial and Commercial Daily" also pointed out that the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia are definitely not from the will of the broad masses of the Indonesian people, but because some people have fallen into the trap of the imperialists to sow discord. The newspaper said that in order to divert the Indonesian people's struggle goals and undermine the friendship between the two countries, the imperialists are of course happy to set off an anti-Chinese wave in Indonesia, which has a hundred harms and no benefits to the Indonesian people. Wise politicians should be vigilant about this.

### 缅甸和柬埔寨华侨报纸奉劝印度尼西亚当局  解决华侨问题应该根据万隆精神  反华排华活动只会使帝国主义拍手称快

    缅甸和柬埔寨华侨报纸奉劝印度尼西亚当局
    解决华侨问题应该根据万隆精神
    反华排华活动只会使帝国主义拍手称快
    新华社13日讯　仰光消息：缅甸华侨报纸“人民报”11月4日发表社论，强烈谴责美帝国主义勾结印度尼西亚的反动势力，进行挑拨离间，阴谋破坏华侨和印度尼西亚人民之间的友好关系，社论指出，这是美帝国主义敌视新中国的阴谋的一部分。“人民报”禁止华侨小商贩营业对当地民族经济不利
    社论指出，印度尼西亚当局最近采取的排华措施将使旅居印度尼西亚的华侨的生活受到很大的影响。
    使他们的生存权利受到严重威胁。
    社论接着驳斥了所谓华侨小商贩同印度尼西亚民族经济之间存在“惨烈的竞争”的说法。社论指出，在印度尼西亚的华侨小商贩的资本一般是很小的，他们胼手胝足，起早摸黑，辛勤劳动，换来的代价只是用来维持家庭的生活。这些小商贩在印度尼西亚整个商业方面显然不是居于主要的地位，和当地的民族经济不会有“惨烈的竞争”，这和美国、荷兰、英国等帝国主义的垄断资本操纵着印度尼西亚的经济和掠夺高额利润的情况，在本质上是完全不同的。社论指出，但是印度尼西亚当局不是采取必要的措施来对付这些帝国主义垄断企业，而是企图禁止华侨小商贩的传统经营。这种舍本逐末的做法不但对印度尼西亚民族经济的发展没有好处，相反地，会使民族经济的繁荣受到影响。
    这家报纸希望印度尼西亚当局采取妥善的措施，贯彻中国和印度尼西亚外交部长最近发表的联合公报的精神，加强两国之间的友好合作，使帝国主义者的挑拨伎俩无法得逞。“新仰光报”迅速制止排华活动警惕帝国主义阴谋“新仰光报”也在11月4日发表社论，要求印度尼西亚政府停止排华活动，根据两国外交部长联合公报的精神、和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的精神，解决华侨问题。
    社论指出，在印度尼西亚的华侨的经济力量事实上始终属于印度尼西亚国民经济的范畴中，并未自成系统，如果善为利用，当能为当地经济作出应有的贡献。与此相反，殖民主义国家的垄断资本控制着印度尼西亚的经济命脉，使当地人民和华侨受着同样的剥削。因此，印度尼西亚经济的主要出路是协同华侨抵抗殖民主义者的大规模掠夺，而不是排斥对沟通印度尼西亚城乡经济有所贡献的华侨小商贩。
    社论驳斥了帝国主义散布的诬蔑华侨是“第五纵队”和华侨经济是“殖民主义经济残余”的说法。社论指出，华侨在国外只为谋生，丝毫没有殖民主义性质。他们遵守和平共处五项原则，不干预侨居国的政治。社论谴责美帝国主义散布上述诬蔑来挑拨排华的阴谋。
    “新仰光报”在11月20日再次发表社论，要求迅速制止在印度尼西亚发生的排华活动。这家报纸驳斥了硬把华侨小商贩说成是“垄断资本主义者”的论调。它指出，这种说法实在是张冠李戴。印度尼西亚境内确实有非常庞大的外国资本垄断当地的重要资源，但是，这些垄断资本的主人是西方帝国主义者。
    这家报纸指出，在印度尼西亚发生的排华活动发展得日益严重，帝国主义还在煽动、挑拨。社论要求立即停止排华活动，并且根据中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长联合公报的精神来解决华侨问题。
    “生活周报”亚洲国家应该友好帝国主义才是公敌
    在仰光出版的“生活周报”11月8日发表评论指出，中国和印度尼西亚是友好的亚洲国家，两国都受美帝国主义的威胁。两国互相团结，才能击退帝国主义的进攻。如果和万隆原则背道而驰，那就恰恰中了美帝国主义破坏亚洲人民的团结以便各个击破的诡计。评论要求印度尼西亚方面立即停止排华活动，通过友好协商，使华侨问题得到公正合理的解决。
    新华社13日讯　金边消息：柬埔寨的华侨报纸最近发表评论，对在印度尼西亚发生的排华活动表示遗憾和关切，并且希望印度尼西亚政府以两国友好关系为重，根据中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长联合公报的精神来处理华侨问题。
    “棉华日报”以万隆精神为基础华侨问题不难解决
    “棉华日报”在11月20日发表的评论说，华侨生活在印度尼西亚，一直都以智慧的头脑和勤劳的双手参加当地建设。华侨的勤劳朴实一向为侨居国人民所称道，连殖民主义者也不得不承认华侨对当地建设的贡献。评论指出，印度尼西亚经济发展受到阻碍，只是殖民主义者控制它的经济命脉和劫掠它的经济资源造成的结果。
    这家报纸指出，印度尼西亚当局禁止县以下华侨小商贩营业和强迫华侨迁移的做法显然同维护印度尼西亚的民族利益问题无关。评论说，在印度尼西亚的华侨和当地人民之间没有根本矛盾。
    这家报纸认为要把华侨问题和印度尼西亚和中国的关系问题分开，这是不可设想的。它说，中国政府历来教育华侨奉公守法，但是也要保护华侨的正当权益。报纸接着说，友谊是双方面的，不是片面的。它应该建立在合理解决双方争端的基础上。
    这家报纸说，“中国的敌人是帝国主义者，印度尼西亚的敌人也是帝国主义者，两国都要维护民族独立。既然两国都有着共同的敌人，共同的目标，加上以根据万隆精神维护两国关系为基础，两国之间又有什么不可解决的问题呢？！”
    这家报纸在11月13日刊载了一封读者来信。这位读者在信中谈到在印度尼西亚发生的排华活动说，“这是殖民主义者的一种阴谋。他们企图挑起当地民族和华侨之间的恶感，以便自己渔人得利。”这位读者指出，如果在印度尼西亚发生的排华活动继续下去，只会使帝国主义者拍手称快。
    “棉华日报”在11月29日再次发表评论说，在印度尼西亚的华侨对印度尼西亚的开发事业有过不可磨灭的贡献，今天也对印度尼西亚的经济发展起着有利的作用，他们在印度尼西亚的正当权益受到中国政府的保护，也应当受到印度尼西亚政府的尊重。
    这家报纸说，印度尼西亚当局说不能损害印度尼西亚和中国之间的友谊，但是却对中国侨民进行迫害，把两国外交部长的联合公报当做废纸，置中国政府的抗议不顾。报纸问道：难道这是尊重两国友谊所应有的态度吗？
    “工商日报”排华有百害无一利明智政治家应警惕
    “工商日报”在11月20日的评论中驳斥了把华侨经济视为所谓对印度尼西亚不利的“殖民主义经济残余”的说法。评论说，华侨小商贩遵守当地法律，尽纳税的义务，同时也供应了人民物质需要，促进了城乡物资交流。由此可见，华侨小商小贩对当地的经济繁荣只有利而毫无所损。印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约同中国外交部长陈毅发表的联合公报也认为，华侨的经济力量将仍然对于印度尼西亚的经济发展起有益的作用。这家报纸指出，真正阻碍（印度尼西亚）国民经济发展的是殖民主义者和垄断资本家。
    这家报纸指责印度尼西亚军警强迫华侨迁居和殴伤华侨的行为。它说，这种粗暴行为违反了万隆会议十项原则中关于尊重基本人权的原则。
    这家报纸希望印度尼西亚当局能够根据中国和印度尼西亚两国外交部长联合公报的精神来处理华侨问题。它说，这样做既使华侨得以安居乐业，而印度尼西亚的经济也将得以维持安定。
    “工商日报”在11月3日发表的一篇评论中还曾经指出，在印度尼西亚发生的排华活动绝对不是出自印度尼西亚广大人民的意愿，而是由于有人中了帝国主义者挑拨离间的奸计。这家报纸说，帝国主义为了转移印度尼西亚人民的斗争目标，破坏两国的友谊，当然乐于在印度尼西亚掀起排华浪潮，这对印度尼西亚人民是有百害而无一利的。对于这点，明智的政治家是应该有所警惕的。
