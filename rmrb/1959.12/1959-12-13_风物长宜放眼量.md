    "Broaden Your Horizons and Take the Long View"
    Xie Yi

    Just as even in a flowery meadow there may be one or two withered branches, so too in this brilliant and splendid era, there are some who live with gloomy faces. Not only do they lack vigorous vitality, but they are also indifferent and apathetic to new things. They don't like this, they don't love that. Others work with great enthusiasm and sing with joy, but they close their ears and don't listen, squint their eyes and don't look, shut their mouths and don't speak, and don't want to move at all. Some of them are as timid as mice, shrinking back at every turn. Therefore, they follow what others do. They go to work and get off work on time, but they just don't work with any energy. They have to be pushed to move, and if they aren't pushed, they don't move. Sometimes they are like clocks with broken springs, moving a little and then stopping again.

    Are they being cautious? But behind the scenes, they grumble: "Good heavens, it's too tense, let me have some peace," "In the past, we were free and at ease, but now... alas, alas." These people, at the slightest sign of trouble, "freely" lean towards the Right opportunists, echoing their sentiments. They originally had half their body on the socialist train, and at the first turn, they tilted over, some even falling off.

    What causes them to be so unhappy and unable to stand up straight?

    These people, due to the changes of the times, were pushed onto the socialist road, though neither willingly nor consciously. Because they were not in control, they were absent-minded. Thus, "Their souls are accustomed to being unrestrained, and they again tread on willow catkins across Xie Bridge." Confused, they always yearn for the capitalist kingdom. But unfortunately, they were born at the wrong time. Now is the time when this doomed capitalism is declining and dying. Their broken dreams are over, and the road to retreat is blocked. They are unwilling to step onto the road of advancement for the time being. Disappointed, they pace back and forth in the small world between advancing and retreating, feeling dizzy, tired, and exhausted. The scene before them is ever-changing and infinitely beautiful, but these people cannot muster any energy.

    The plays of emperors and generals are over, and the plays of exploiting class rentiers are also over. The corrupt things have already fallen and will never rise again. Why linger over that stinking and dirty past and refuse to move forward? They should not use their own hands to build an invisible high wall, isolating themselves from the new society and from the masses. "Cold and cheerless, desolate and miserable," it is not good for socialism, nor is it good for themselves. "Too many complaints can break your heart; broaden your horizons and take the long view." (Chairman Mao: A Gift to Mr. Liu Yazi) They should open their eyes, assess the situation, assess themselves, make a thorough break with all old ideas, and take big strides to catch up.

    “风物长宜放眼量”
    谢逸
    正如万花似锦的芳草地里也会有一两株枯枝一样，在现在的光辉烂灿的时代，也会有一些愁眉苦脸地过日子的人。他们不但没有蓬蓬勃勃的朝气，而且对新事物冷淡、漠然，这事不欢喜，那事不热爱，别人干得轰轰烈烈，唱得高高兴兴，他却闭耳不听，眯眼不看，噤口不语，一动也不想动。他们当中有的人是胆小如鼠，缩手缩脚。因此，别人干什么，他跟着干什么，上班下班也还算按时，可就是干来没气力，推一推，动一动，不推不动，有时还像断了弹簧的钟表，动一下，又停下来了。
    说他们谨小慎微么？但背地里却嘀嘀咕咕；“老天爷呀，太紧张了，让我安静一些罢，”“过去么，自由自在，如今呢……唉，唉”。这些人，一到风吹草动，就“自由”地向着右倾机会主义者那面倒，随声附和起来。他们原是半边身子挂在社会主义的车子上，一遇拐弯，就倾了过去，有的还摔了下来。
    什么原因使他们郁郁寡欢，挺不起腰板呢？
    这些人，由于时代的转变，自己虽不自愿也不自觉，但还是给推上了社会主义道路，由于身不由主，自己心不在焉，于是，“梦魂惯得无拘检，又踏杨花过谢桥。”迷迷糊糊的，总是留恋着资本主义王国。但可惜是生不逢时，现在已经是这倒霉的资本主义没落死亡的时候。更残梦断，向后转的道路已给堵住了，向前进的道路一时又不愿意踏上去，失望之余，就在前进后退之间的小天地里，一圈又一圈的踱起步来，头晕眼花，精疲力倦。眼前气象万千，无限美妙，而这一些人却提不起劲来。
    帝王将相的戏是唱完了，剥削阶级食利分子的戏也唱完了。腐朽的东西既已倒下去，就永无爬起来的日子，何必为着那臭气肮脏的过去而徘徊不进呢？不应该用自己的手造起一座无形的高墙，将自己从新社会、从群众隔离开来；“冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨戚戚”，对社会主义没有好处，对自己也没有好处，“牢骚太盛防肠断，风物长宜放眼量。”（毛主席：赠柳亚子先生）还是放开眼界，量一量形势，量一量自己，还是和一切旧观念进行彻底的决裂，迈开大步赶上前去的好。
