Rivers Freeze, Transportation Doesn't Stop
Hebei Actively Prepares to Develop Ice Transportation

    Hebei Province is actively preparing for winter ice transportation. Two work groups organized by the Provincial Department of Transportation have recently gone to Chengde and Zhangjiakou areas respectively to help survey waterways. Tianjin is also repairing more than 10,000 old ice sleds, seeking and increasing ways for ice transportation.

    Hebei Province has more than 300 rivers longer than ten kilometers, with a total length of 15,000 kilometers. In addition to thousands of ditches, depressions, reservoirs, and ponds, this provides certain conditions for developing ice transportation. However, in the past, most areas did not take advantage of this condition, and navigation often stopped when the rivers froze. In order to change this situation, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has required all localities to vigorously develop ice transportation this year, so that navigation can continue in all seasons, turning winter slack into winter busy. In the southern areas with warmer climates, efforts should be made to vigorously develop ice-breaking transportation, so that water transportation and ice transportation are carried out simultaneously, and ice sleds and ships are used together.

    河冻不停航
    河北积极准备开展冰上运输
    河北省积极进行冬季冰上运输准备工作。省交通厅组织的两个工作组，最近已经分别到承德、张家口地区，帮助两地勘察河道；天津市也在整修一万多只旧冰床，寻找和增加冰上运输的途径。
    河北省境内有十公里以上的河三百多条，总长一万五千多公里，加上几千条沟渠和洼淀、水库、池塘，为发展冰上运输提供了一定的条件。但是，过去大部分地区没有利用这一条件，常常是河水冻，航运停。为了改变这种情况，中共河北省委今年要求各地大力发展冰上运输，使航运做到四季不停，变冬闲为冬忙，南部气候较暖的地区要大搞破冰运输，做到水运、冰运一齐搞，冰床、船舶齐上阵。
