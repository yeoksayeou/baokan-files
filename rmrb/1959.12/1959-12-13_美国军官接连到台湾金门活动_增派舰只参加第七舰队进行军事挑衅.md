Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Taipei dispatch: The heavy cruiser "Bremerton," dispatched from the U.S. mainland to the Far East for assignment to the Seventh Fleet, departed from Keelung Port, Taiwan, on the 10th for the Ryukyu Islands to participate in provocative exercises by the U.S. Navy in the waters off the Ryukyu Islands. Nelson, commander of the U.S. Navy's Third Cruiser Fleet, clamored in Taiwan that the "Bremerton" would be ready to carry out so-called "patrol missions" in the Taiwan Strait at the orders of the Seventh Fleet.

In recent days, batches of American generals have continued to arrive in Taiwan and Kinmen to carry out conspiratorial activities. Ryan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Pacific Command, and Bowker, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, flew from Taipei to Kinmen on the 8th and climbed to the top of Mount Taiwu on the island and spied on our mainland situation from the beach. Taiwanese newspapers revealed that the purpose of the two American generals' visit was to "examine the logistics of the Kinmen battlefield in order to consider what support measures the U.S. Pacific Command would take in the event of war." McLee, Deputy Commander of the 3rd Marine Division of the U.S. Marine Corps, and Robarso, Deputy Commander of the 1st Air Wing, also arrived in Taipei on the 10th and inspected the Chiang army's Marine Corps exercises in southern Taiwan the following day.

With the participation of American military advisors, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have recently conducted a series of military exercises. Chiang's Marine Corps has been conducting amphibious landing exercises in southern Taiwan since the 9th. Chiang's air force held atomic weapons offense and defense exercises over the Chiayi area on the 5th.

    增派舰只参加第七舰队进行军事挑衅
    新华社12日讯　台北消息：由美国本土增派来远东配属第七舰队的重巡洋舰“布莱梅顿”号，已在10日从台湾基隆港开往琉球，参加美国海军在琉球群岛海面举行的挑衅性演习。美国海军第三巡洋舰队司令尼尔逊在台湾叫嚣说，“布莱梅顿”号将随时听第七舰队的命令在台湾海峡执行所谓“巡逻任务”。
    近几天来，继续有一批批的美国将军到台湾和金门进行阴谋活动。太平洋美军总部副参谋长瑞安和美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团副团长鲍凯曾在8日由台北飞往金门，并且在岛上攀登太武山顶和到海滩偷窥我大陆情况。台湾报纸透露，这两个美国将军此行的目的是“考察金门战地后勤业务，以便考虑一旦发生战况，美军太平洋总部如何采取支援措施”。美国海军陆战队第三师副师长麦利和第一航空联队副联队长罗巴索也在10日到台北，并且在次日往台湾南部视察蒋军海军陆战队的演习。
    在美国军事顾问的参与下，蒋介石军队最近也接连举行军事演习。蒋军海军陆战队从9日起在台湾南部举行两栖登陆作战演习。蒋军空军5日在嘉义地区上空举行原子武器攻防演习。
