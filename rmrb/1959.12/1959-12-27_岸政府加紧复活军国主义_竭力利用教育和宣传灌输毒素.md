Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 26th: According to an announcement by the Japanese Ministry of Education today, the naginata (long-handled sword) subject, aimed at cultivating the militaristic "Bushido" spirit, can now be included as part of the physical education curriculum in junior high schools and above.

Since Japan's unconditional surrender in 1945, the teaching of "Bushido" subjects such as judo, kendo, and naginata had been banned in Japanese schools. However, in recent years, especially since Nobusuke Kishi came to power, judo and kendo subjects have been restored in junior high schools and above. With the Japanese Ministry of Education's announcement today to restore the naginata subject, all the "Bushido" subjects, which were previously used to instill militaristic education in Japanese students, have been completely restored.

At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government is launching various propaganda machines to vigorously promote militaristic ideas. For example, the "Bungei Shunju" weekly magazine began publishing an article entitled "Hideki Tojo and the Pacific War" starting with its first issue in December. This article, written by the notorious Japanese Class A war criminal Sato Kenryo, defends the aggressive war launched by Japanese militarism.

The "Sankei Shimbun" is even more systematically eulogizing militarism. This newspaper publishes a daily series on the rise and fall of Japanese warlords, authored by Ito Masanori, a military commentator who specializes in glorifying the "Japanese Imperial" army. In his articles, he blatantly beautifies the Japanese imperialist aggression against China and other Asian countries.

The Japanese Toho Film Company recently produced a film promoting the Emperor system. This film, entitled "The Birth of Japan," uses ancient Japanese mythology to promote Japanese Emperor-based imperialism and the spirit of the "Yamato race."

At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government is also strengthening its control over the publication of textbooks for primary and secondary school students. According to Japanese newspapers, one publisher had its publishing license revoked by the authorities because it stated in its junior high school textbooks that the Pacific War was an aggressive war launched by Japan.

### 岸政府加紧复活军国主义  竭力利用教育和宣传灌输毒素

　　岸政府加紧复活军国主义
    竭力利用教育和宣传灌输毒素
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：据日本文部省今天宣布，目的在于培养军国主义“武士道”精神的长柄大刀科目今后将可以作为初中以上学校的体育课内容。
    自1945年日本帝国主义宣布无条件投降以后，在日本学校中已经禁止教柔道、剑道和长柄大刀等“武士道”科目。但是，近几年、特别是岸信介上台以来，柔道和剑道科目已经在初中以上学校中恢复。在日本文部省今天宣布恢复长柄大刀科目后，过去用来向日本学生灌输军国主义教育而设的“武士道”科目就全部恢复了。
    岸信介政府同时正在发动各种宣传机器大肆鼓吹军国主义思想。例如，“文春”周刊从12月第一期起开始刊登题为“东条英机与太平洋战争”的文章。这篇由臭名远扬的日本甲级战犯佐藤贤了写的文章为日本军国主义发动的侵略战争辩解。
    “产经新闻”更是有系统地歌颂军国主义。这家报纸每天连续刊登所谓日本军阀兴亡史，作者是专门为“日本帝国”军队吹嘘的军事评论家伊藤正德。他在文章中露骨地美化日本帝国主义侵略中国和亚洲各国的行为。
    日本东宝电影公司最近又摄制了一部宣传天皇制度的影片。这部名叫“日本的诞生”的电影借用日本古代神话鼓吹日本的天皇制帝国主义和“大和民族”精神。
    同时，岸信介政府还在加强对中小学生课本出版的控制。据日本报纸透露，有一家出版社由于在它所出版的中学生课本中写明太平洋战争是日本发动的侵略战争，因而被有关当局取消了出版资格。
