Xinhua News Agency, Chongjin, 16th - The first group of 975 Korean residents from Japan, who returned to their long-awaited motherland on two Soviet ships, arrived at Chongjin Port in northern Korea this morning.

They were warmly welcomed at the pier by Li Zhouyuan, Chairman of the Central Committee for Welcoming Korean Residents from Japan Returning Home and Deputy Prime Minister of the Cabinet, other government leaders, heads of political parties and social organizations, and over 10,000 people from Chongjin City.

Today, Chongjin Port was filled with joy. The national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fluttered in the wind, and a giant portrait of Premier Kim Il-sung and a banner reading "Warmly Welcome Korean Residents from Japan Returning Home!" were hung above the newly built rest area for returning Korean residents. The Korean residents, who had waged an unyielding struggle for a long time to return to their socialist motherland, disembarked amidst music and cheers. The welcoming crowd presented them with flowers and pinned a large red flower on the chest of each returning resident.

Among the returning Korean residents from Japan, the majority are from South Korea. Unwilling to return to South Korea under the occupation of the U.S. military and the dark rule of the Syngman Rhee clique, they longed to return to the socialist northern part of the Republic. Some of them were forcibly taken from Chongjin Port to Japan as laborers during the Japanese imperialist rule. Today, they stepped onto the soil of their motherland again from Chongjin Port. Seeing the prosperous and magnificent scenery here, many were moved to tears.

Subsequently, a welcoming rally for the returning Korean residents from Japan was held in the rest area at the pier. Li Zhouyuan expressed a warm welcome to the returning Korean residents in his speech at the rally. He said that the people of the northern half of the Republic have made all the preparations to welcome the returning Korean residents from Japan. He hoped that the returning Korean residents would be builders of the socialist motherland and strive to create a new life.

Li Shunying, the representative of the returning Korean residents from Japan, expressed gratitude for the deep concern shown by the government of the Republic for the Korean residents in Japan in her speech. She said that the returning Korean residents will learn from the compatriots of the motherland and exert all their strength and talent in the positions needed by the motherland. Han Xueye, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Park Sung-chul, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kim Chun-hae, Chairman of the Presidium of the Fatherland Front, Kim Eung-gi, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross Society, Hwang Bong-gu, Vice Chairman of the General Federation of Korean Residents in Japan, and heads of political parties and social organizations also came to the pier to welcome and participate in the welcoming rally.

After the welcoming rally, the returning Korean residents went to the guest house by car for rest, and were warmly welcomed by 50,000 people of Chongjin City along the way.

    李周渊勉励归侨做社会主义祖国的建设者
    新华社清津16日电　从日本回国的第一批旅日朝鲜侨民九百七十五人，今天上午分乘两艘苏联轮船到达朝鲜北部清津港，回到了他们渴念已久的祖国。
    他们在码头上受到朝鲜欢迎旅日侨胞回国中央委员会委员长、内阁副首相李周渊等政府首长、各政党、社会团体负责人和清津市一万多人民的热烈欢迎。
    今天，清津港喜气洋洋，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗迎风招展，新建的归国朝侨休息室上面高悬着金日成首相的巨像和写着“热烈欢迎旅日侨胞归来！”的标语。长久以来为返回自己的社会主义祖国而进行了不屈不挠的斗争的朝侨们在音乐声和欢呼声中下船登岸。欢迎群众向他们献花，并且在每位归国侨胞胸前佩上一朵大红花。
    在归国的旅日朝侨中间大部分人的家乡是在南朝鲜，他们不愿回到在美军占领和李承晚集团黑暗统治下的南朝鲜，渴望回到社会主义的共和国北部。他们当中有的是在日本帝国主义统治时期从清津港被强抓到日本去做苦工的，今天又从清津港重新踏上祖国的土地，看到这里繁荣壮丽的景色，许多人感动得流下热泪。
    接着，在码头休息室内举行了欢迎旅日朝侨归来的大会。李周渊在大会上讲话时表示热烈欢迎旅日朝侨回国。他说，共和国北半部人民已经做好了迎接旅日朝侨的一切准备工作。他希望归国朝侨做一个社会主义祖国的建设者，努力创造新生活。
    归国朝侨代表李舜英在讲话时对共和国政府给予旅日朝侨的深厚关怀表示感谢。他说，归国朝侨将向祖国的同胞学习，在祖国需要的岗位上发挥自己的一切力量和才能。到码头欢迎和参加欢迎大会的还有朝鲜最高人民会议常务委员会副委员长韩雪野、外务相朴成哲、祖国战线议长团议长金天海、朝鲜红十字会中央委员会委员长金应基、旅日朝鲜人总联合会副议长黄凤九和各政党、社会团体负责人。
