Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 17th. The communique of the 12th meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) was published here on the 16th.

The communique first pointed out the increasing role of the CMEA in organizing economic cooperation among its member states.

The communique stated that the Council meeting discussed and approved the Charter of the CMEA and the Convention on the legal capacity, privileges, and immunities of the Council. The communique pointed out that the Charter of the CMEA solidifies the close economic and scientific-technical cooperation historically practiced by European socialist countries. This cooperation is built on the foundation of complete equality, respect for national interests, mutual benefit, and fraternal mutual assistance. The Charter expresses that the governments of the CMEA member states, in order to build socialism and communism in their countries and to safeguard lasting peace throughout the world, will resolutely develop this cooperation in the future based on consistently implementing the international division of labor among socialist countries. At the same time, the Charter expresses the determination of the CMEA member states to develop economic ties with all countries with different social systems on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs.

The Charter stipulates that the CMEA may admit other European countries as member states, provided that they endorse the purposes and principles of the Council and agree to undertake the obligations stipulated in the Charter.

The communique pointed out that the meeting discussed the reports submitted by the standing committees of the CMEA and approved recommendations on issues related to economic ties among the member states of the Council.

The communique pointed out that the meeting adopted recommendations on the further specialization of production of extremely important chemical equipment, some sugar industry equipment, meat processing industry equipment, and paper industry equipment.

The measures adopted at the meeting regarding ferrous metallurgy stipulate further improvement of the technological processes of iron ore beneficiation, improvement of a series of technical and economic indicators of ferrous metallurgical enterprises, and further expansion of the metallurgical raw material resources and fuel resources of some participating countries of the CMEA, and ensuring greater production of iron, steel, steel products, and steel pipes. With the assistance of relevant member states of the CMEA, the mining of iron-nickel ore in Albania and iron ore in Bulgaria will develop at a faster rate.

The communique pointed out that since the 11th meeting of the Council, the member states of the CMEA have largely implemented the Council's recommendations on expanding non-ferrous metal resources and production. The meeting hopes that special attention will be paid to the specialization of non-ferrous metal production in the future.

The meeting studied the issue of increasing the production of wool and oil-bearing raw materials in the member states of the Council, as well as expanding the production and sales of fresh and processed fruits, grapes, and vegetables. Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania are prepared to utilize their existing favorable conditions to greatly increase the production of fruits, grapes, and vegetables for export to other countries.

The meeting adopted a multilateral agreement drafted by the Standing Committee on Agriculture regarding cooperation among socialist countries in veterinary medicine, quarantine, and the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests.

The communique also pointed out that the extensive work carried out by the CMEA member states in consulting on the volume of import and export goods and selecting more economical modes of transportation and routes for transporting these goods – including pipeline transportation – has a positive significance.

The 12th meeting of the Council was conducted in an atmosphere of complete unanimity, mutual understanding, and fraternal cooperation.
