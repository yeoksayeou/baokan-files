Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd. Chairman Zhu De of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China today replied to Chairman Choi Yong-kun of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea on the issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea. At the same time, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also replied to the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea, fully supporting the proposal put forward by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea.
　　
The above two reply letters were delivered today by Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, to Li Yong-ho, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China. The full texts of the two reply letters are as follows: To Comrade Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea:
　　
I am honored to have received the appeal letter from the Second Session of the Sixth Supreme People's Assembly on the issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea to the parliaments of all countries in the world. The Chinese people fully support the proposal put forward by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea.
　　
In order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a series of fair and reasonable proposals. Unfortunately, these peaceful proposals have been unreasonably rejected by the United States and the Syngman Rhee authorities. In order to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Korean and Chinese sides have taken active measures on their own initiative. In October 1958, the major action of the Chinese People's Volunteers voluntarily and completely withdrawing from Korea not only opened up a new realistic path for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but also powerfully demonstrated the sincerity of the Korean and Chinese sides for peace to the world. However, it has been more than a year since the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea, and the US government has not taken corresponding measures to withdraw its troops from South Korea. Recently, at the United Nations General Assembly, the United States once again ganged up with some countries to unreasonably refuse the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue, and forcibly passed the proposal put forward by the United States and other fourteen invading countries, with the aim of allowing the US troops to continue to stay in South Korea and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea.
　　
At a time when the momentum of people all over the world demanding the settlement of international disputes through peaceful negotiations is growing, the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has issued an appeal to the world demanding that the United States and all other foreign troops withdraw from South Korea and achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea without foreign interference. This is fully in line with the current international trend. This solemn appeal has been and will continue to be valued and supported by peace-loving countries and people. Since the US government has also stated that all unresolved international issues should be resolved peacefully through negotiations, it should seriously consider the just appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and take swift measures to prove its sincerity for peace with the practical action of withdrawing US troops from South Korea. This is a minimum test of whether the US government is willing to ease international tensions. All countries that have sent troops to South Korea should also seriously consider the calls of the entire Korean people and take active measures to withdraw their troops from South Korea as soon as possible. The unfortunate situation of the division of Korea should be brought to an end. Only when all foreign troops withdraw from South Korea can the necessary conditions be created for the Korean people to peacefully resolve their own problems through consultations between the North and South authorities.
　　
The Chinese people have always firmly supported the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their country. The Chinese people firmly believe that with the support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and people in the world, the just cause of the Korean people will surely achieve final victory.
　　
With the highest respect!
　　　　　　Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De (signature)

Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea Central Committee:
　　
The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is honored to have received your committee's letter and the accompanying letter from the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the parliaments of all countries in the world on the issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference believes that the proposal put forward by the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, demanding that the United States and all other foreign troops withdraw from South Korea and allow the Korean people to conduct free general elections in North and South Korea according to their own will and without any foreign interference, in order to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea, not only profoundly reflects the strong national aspirations of the 30 million Korean people, but also fully conforms to the universal demands of people all over the world to ease international tensions. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference expresses its complete agreement and warm support for this. We believe that the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country will surely achieve final victory.
                            The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

　　朱德委员长和政协全国委员会答复朝鲜呼吁信
    完全支持和平统一朝鲜的建议
    严正指出美国政府应当迅速采取措施从南朝鲜撤退美国军队
    新华社23日讯　中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会朱德委员长今天就朝鲜的和平统一问题复信给朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会崔庸健委员长，同时中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会也复信给朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会，完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议提出的要求实现朝鲜和平统一的建议。
    上述两封复信已于今日由中华人民共和国外交部副部长姬鹏飞面交朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使李永镐。两封复信的全文如下：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健同志：
    我荣幸地收到了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第二届第六次会议就朝鲜的和平统一问题致世界各国议会的呼吁信。中国人民完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议提出的要求实现朝鲜和平统一的建议。
    为了和平解决朝鲜问题，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国曾经提出过一系列公平合理的方案。遗憾的是，这些和平的建议遭到了美国和李承晚当局的无理拒绝。为了促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，朝中方面主动地采取了积极措施。1958年10月，中国人民志愿军主动、全部撤出朝鲜的重大行动，不仅为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了新的现实途径，同时也有力地向全世界说明了朝中方面的和平诚意。但是，中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜已经一年多了，美国政府一直没有采取相应的措施，撤出它在南朝鲜的军队。最近，在联合国大会上，美国又一次纠集一些国家无理地拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加关于朝鲜问题的讨论，并且强行通过了美国等十四个侵朝国家提出的提案，目的在于使美国军队继续赖在南朝鲜，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。
    正当全世界人民要求用和平谈判的方法解决国际争端的声势越来越高涨的时候，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议向全世界发出要求美国和其他一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜，在没有外国军队干涉下实现朝鲜和平统一的呼吁，是同当前的国际潮流完全一致的。这个庄严的呼吁已经受到并将继续受到热爱和平的国家和人民的重视和支持。美国政府既然也曾经表示，一切没有解决的国际问题都应该通过谈判和平解决，那么，就应该郑重考虑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议的正义呼吁，迅速采取措施，以从南朝鲜撤退美国军队的实际行动来证明自己对和平的诚意。这是对美国政府是否愿意和缓国际紧张局势的一个最起码的考验。所有向南朝鲜派遣军队的国家，也应该严肃地考虑全体朝鲜人民的呼声，为尽快地从南朝鲜撤回他们的军队采取积极的措施。朝鲜分裂的不幸局面，已经是应该终结的时候了。只有一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜，才能创造必要的条件，让朝鲜人民通过南北当局的协商来和平解决自己的问题。
    中国人民一贯坚决支持朝鲜人民为和平统一自己的祖国而进行的正义斗争。中国人民坚信，在以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，朝鲜人民的正义事业一定能够获得最后的胜利。
    此致最崇高的敬意！
　　　　　　中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长　朱德（签名）
                             一九五九年十二月二十三日于北京朝鲜民主主义人民共和国祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会：
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会荣幸地收到贵委员会的来信和随信附来的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议就朝鲜的和平统一问题致世界各国国会的信。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会认为，朝鲜最高人民会议提出的要求美国及其他一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜，让朝鲜人民在不受任何外来干涉的情况下，根据自己的意志，进行南北朝鲜的自由普选，来实现朝鲜和平统一的建议，不仅深刻地反映了三千万朝鲜人民强烈的民族愿望，同时也完全符合全世界人民缓和国际紧张局势的普遍要求。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会对此表示完全赞同和热烈支持。我们相信，朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国而进行的斗争，必将取得最后胜利。
