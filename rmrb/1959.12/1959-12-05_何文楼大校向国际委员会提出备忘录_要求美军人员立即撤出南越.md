Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd. Major General He Wenlou, head of the liaison delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, submitted a memorandum to the International Commission for Vietnam on November 18th, once again regarding the continued presence of the U.S. "Equipment Replacement Team" in South Vietnam.

    The memorandum stated that the U.S. "Equipment Replacement Team" has not yet left South Vietnam, which violates the resolution made by the International Commission on December 27, 1958. The resolution stipulates that the "Equipment Replacement Team," which violates the Geneva Accords, "cannot continue to exist, and the personnel of the 'Equipment Replacement Team' must withdraw from South Vietnam before June 1959."

    The memorandum said that recently the South Vietnamese authorities have blatantly stated that "'Equipment Replacement Team' cannot complete its mission by the end of June 1959, nor can it be foreseen when its activities will cease." The memorandum pointed out that this argument by the Vietnamese authorities exposes their conspiracy to indefinitely maintain the U.S. "Equipment Replacement Team," which illegally entered South Vietnam. However, the liaison delegation is surprised that when the South Vietnamese authorities adopt such a blatant and irresponsible attitude towards the International Commission's resolution, the International Commission has not insisted on its above-mentioned resolution, but only suggested that the U.S. "Equipment Replacement Team" leave South Vietnam "as soon as possible."

    The memorandum pointed out that in the face of such an arrogant attitude from the South Vietnamese authorities, the International Commission's vaguely defined recommendation will be used by the South Vietnamese authorities to allow the U.S. "Equipment Replacement Team" to exist illegally in South Vietnam indefinitely.

    The memorandum stated that the liaison delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army once again requests the International Commission to reiterate that the entry of the U.S. "Equipment Replacement Team" into South Vietnam is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords, and to take measures to force the South Vietnamese authorities to strictly implement the International Commission's resolution, end the illegal presence of the U.S. "Equipment Replacement Team" in South Vietnam, and supervise the withdrawal of the personnel of the U.S. "Equipment Replacement Team" from South Vietnam.

    Prior to this, on November 16th, Major General He Wenlou wrote to the General Secretariat of the International Commission for Vietnam regarding the continued presence of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in South Vietnam.

    The letter pointed out that U.S. imperialism, under the guise of a military advisory group, is intensifying its efforts to continue importing military personnel and war materials into South Vietnam. At the same time, they are also instigating and assisting the pro-American government of Laos to expand the civil war, making the tense situation in Indochina increasingly serious.

    The letter said that the U.S.-Ngo clique is clinging to the "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed on December 23, 1950, between the United States and the then South Vietnamese authorities (Bao Dai regime), as the legal basis for the U.S. Military Advisory Group's refusal to withdraw from South Vietnam. The letter pointed out that, both politically and legally, this treaty has lost its validity after the signing of the Geneva Accords and the restoration of peace in Indochina. Therefore, the U.S. Military Advisory Group's presence in South Vietnam, arising from this military treaty, is a complete violation of the Geneva Accords.

    The letter said that the facts of the past few years have made it clear to public opinion that the U.S. Military Advisory Group has become a U.S. military command standing above the South Vietnamese army and regime. Currently, the number of U.S. officers in the U.S. Military Advisory Group has greatly increased. In addition to the U.S. military personnel who entered South Vietnam at the end of 1954 and 1955, the International Commission for Vietnam has confirmed that 759 U.S. military personnel entered South Vietnam in 1956 and 1957 alone, but this number is far from the actual situation. From the beginning of 1958 to August 1959, 267 U.S. aircraft transported U.S. military personnel to South Vietnam.

    The letter said that U.S. military personnel not only command military training and the construction of military bases in South Vietnam, but also directly participate in the "sweeps" and massacres of the South Vietnamese people.

    Major General He Wenlou once again requested the International Commission for Vietnam to force the South Vietnamese authorities to withdraw the aforementioned U.S. Military Advisory Group under the supervision and monitoring of the International Commission.

### 何文楼大校向国际委员会提出备忘录  要求美军人员立即撤出南越

    何文楼大校向国际委员会提出备忘录
    要求美军人员立即撤出南越
    新华社河内3日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校在11月18日就美国“装备更新团”赖在南越不走再次向越南国际委员会提出备忘录。
    备忘录说，美国“装备更新团”至今仍未离开南越，这违反了国际委员会在1958年12月27日作出的决议，决议规定，违反日内瓦协议的“装备更新团”“不能继续存在，‘装备更新团’的人员必须在1959年6月以前撤出南越”。
    备忘录说，最近南越当局竟明目张胆地说，“‘装备更新团’不能在1959年6月底完成任务，也不能预先估计在什么时候停止活动”。备忘录指出，越南当局的这一论调，暴露了他们企图无限期地保持非法进入南越的美国“装备更新团”的阴谋。但是联络代表团感到惊奇的是，在南越当局对国际委员会的决议采取如此明目张胆的和不负责任的态度的时候，国际委员会却没有坚持自己上述决议的立场，而只建议美国“装备更新团”“尽早”离开南越。
    备忘录指出，面对着南越当局的这种蛮横态度，国际委员会的限期不明确的建议，将被南越当局利用来使美国“装备更新团”在南越无限期地非法存在下去。
    备忘录说，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团再次要求国际委员会重申美国“装备更新团”进入南越是严重地违反了日内瓦协议，并且采取措施迫使南越当局严格执行国际委员会的决议，结束美国“装备更新团”在南越的非法存在，监督美国“装备更新团”的工作人员撤出南越。
    在此以前，何文楼大校在11月16日就美国军事顾问团赖在南越写信给越南国际委员会总秘书处。
    信中指出，美帝国主义打着军事顾问团的幌子，正在变本加厉地继续向南越输入军事人员和战争物资。同时，他们还指使和帮助老挝亲美政府扩大内战，使印度支那的紧张局势日趋严重。
    信中说，美吴集团死死抓住1950年12月23日美国和当时的南越当局（保大政权）签订的“共同防御条约”，作为美国军事顾问团赖在南越不肯撤走的法理基础。信中指出，不论在政治方面或法理方面，这项条约在签订了日内瓦协议和印度支那和平恢复以后，就已经失去它的效力。因此，由这个军事条约所产生的美国军事顾问团赖在南越，是完全违反日内瓦协议的。
    信中说，几年来的事实使舆论界清楚地知道，美国军事顾问团已经成为高踞南越军队和政权之上的美国军事指挥部。目前美国军事顾问团的美国军官又大大增加。除了在1954年底和1955年进入南越的美国军事人员以外，越南国际委员会已经确认，在1956和1957两年中，已经有七百五十九名美国军事人员进入南越，其实这个数字和实际情况相差甚远。从1958年初到1959年8月为止，就有二百六十七架次美国飞机向南越输入美国军事人员。
    信中说，美国军事人员不仅指挥南越的军事训练和修建军事基地，而且还直接参加对南越人民的“扫荡”和屠杀。
    何文楼大校再次要求越南国际委员会迫使南越当局在国际委员会的监察和监督下，把上述美国军事顾问团撤走。
