    Demanding Cancellation of US Missile Bases
    British Residents Demonstrate
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 29th. More than seven hundred British people demonstrated today to protest against American planes carrying hydrogen bombs flying over Britain day and night, and demanded the cancellation of US missile and bomber bases in Britain.
    The demonstrators started from the US Air Force base in Lids Northalton and reached Oxford after eight hours. The demonstrators included women, children, and students, most of whom were young people. They held up banners that read: "Close the American bases!" "No nuclear weapons for Nazi generals!" and "Stop hydrogen bomb tests!"
    Many British people paid tribute to the demonstrators by sending telegrams and other means, supporting their actions.

    英国居民举行示威游行
    新华社伦敦29日电　七百多个英国人今天举行示威游行，抗议带着氢弹的美国飞机昼夜不停在英国上空飞行，并且要求取消美国设在英国的导弹基地和轰炸机基地。
    参加示威游行的人从不利兹诺尔敦的美国空军基地出发，经过八小时到达牛津。示威者包括妇女、儿童和学生等，其中大多数是青年。他们高举着旗帜，上面写着：“关闭美国基地！”“不给纳粹将军们核武器！”和“停止氢弹试验！”
    许多英国人通过打电报等方式向示威者致敬，支持他们的行动。
