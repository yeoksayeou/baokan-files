Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement strongly protesting against the Laotian Kingdom Government Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone’s repetition of the slander that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was “invading” Laos at the meeting of the National Assembly of Laos on the 18th, and demanding that the Laotian Kingdom Government cease this slander. The statement pointed out that the slander of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam “interfering in Laos” has been completely bankrupt. Phoui Sananikone’s rehash of this cliché at the National Assembly of Laos is an attempt to continue to deceive Lao and world opinion.

The statement pointed out that the Phoui Sananikone government has recently been reorganized. Although the members of the new government do not include the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," Phoui Sananikone announced in the National Assembly that his new government's policies have not changed. At the same time, the Phoui Sananikone government continues to detain Prince Souphanouvong and other members of the Lao Patriotic Front, and continues to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, creating tension. This situation shows that the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements are still being seriously undermined.

The statement said: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the Lao issue must be resolved on the basis of and within the scope of the 1954 Geneva Accords. If the Lao Kingdom Government has the sincerity to follow the path of peace and neutrality and eliminate tensions in Laos, then it must stop following US imperialism, strictly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, allow the International Commission for Laos to resume its activities, and stop the slander against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam consistently pursues a policy of peaceful coexistence. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam hopes to establish good-neighborly relations with Laos on the basis of mutual respect and strict implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos.

　　越南外交部发表声明
    要老挝政府停止对越南的诬蔑
    新华社河内23日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天发表声明，强烈抗议老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空18日在老挝国民议会会议上重复诬蔑越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝的谰言，并且要求老挝王国政府停止这种诬蔑。声明指出，诬蔑越南民主共和国“干涉老挝”的谰言已经遭到彻底的破产。培·萨纳尼空在老挝国民议会会议上重弹这种滥调，是妄图借此继续欺骗老挝和世界的舆论。
    声明指出，培·萨纳尼空政府最近已经改组。新政府的成员虽然没有包括“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们；但是，培·萨纳尼空在国民议会中宣布，他的新政府的政策没有改变。同时，培·萨纳尼空政府仍然拘禁着苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他议员，并且继续诬蔑越南民主共和国，制造紧张局势。这种情况表明，日内瓦协议和万象协议仍然遭受着严重破坏。
    声明说：越南民主共和国政府认为，老挝问题必须在1954年日内瓦协议的基础上和范围内加以解决。如果老挝王国政府具有遵循和平中立道路和消除老挝紧张局势的诚意，那么，它就必须停止追随美帝国主义，严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，让老挝国际委员会恢复活动，停止对越南民主共和国的诬蔑。
    声明说，越南民主共和国始终不渝地奉行和平共处政策。越南民主共和国希望在双方共同尊重和严格履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的基础上，同老挝建立睦邻关系。
