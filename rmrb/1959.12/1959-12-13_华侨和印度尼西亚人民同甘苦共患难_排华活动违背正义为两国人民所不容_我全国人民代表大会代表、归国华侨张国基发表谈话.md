Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Mr. Zhang Guoji, a delegate to the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and a returned overseas Chinese who lived in Indonesia for decades, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today that he warmly supports the suggestions made by Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi in his letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on December 9 regarding a comprehensive solution to the Indonesian overseas Chinese issue. He said that the starting point of the Chinese government is to safeguard the friendship between China and Indonesia and protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. These suggestions are fair and reasonable and fully in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. The Chinese government's suggestions will surely be supported by the broad masses of people in both China and Indonesia.

Mr. Zhang Guoji expressed great indignation at the recent large-scale anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia. He said: Overseas Chinese and Indonesian people have lived together in friendship for thousands of years. Overseas Chinese have made considerable contributions to Indonesia's economic development and have consistently supported the Indonesian people's struggle against colonialism. The Chinese government has always tried its best to help Indonesia when it encounters difficulties. However, today Indonesia treats overseas Chinese as enemy aliens and brutally persecutes and discriminates against them. This is a violation of justice and reason, and it is not only resolutely opposed by the 650 million Chinese people, but also intolerable to the broad masses of Indonesian people.

Overseas Chinese Have Worked Hard and Made Important Contributions to Indonesia's Economic Development

Mr. Zhang Guoji then talked in detail about the history of overseas Chinese migration to Indonesia and their contributions to the local area. He said: Overseas Chinese in Indonesia are completely different from the expatriates of colonialist countries. The expatriates of colonialist countries went to Indonesia with gunboats as their backing, for the purpose of plundering the fruits of the labor of the local people, while overseas Chinese went to Indonesia as laborers to make a living. Although overseas Chinese migration to Indonesia began as early as 1,500 years ago, large-scale migration was a modern phenomenon. From the early 17th century to the mid-18th century, after the Dutch colonialists occupied Indonesia, they kidnapped and deceived a large number of indentured Chinese laborers from the coastal areas of China to Indonesia to develop their colonies. For more than a hundred years, under the frantic aggression of imperialism and the reactionary dark rule at home in old China, the rural areas went bankrupt, the number of unemployed people increased, and a large number of poor farmers from the coastal provinces, especially Guangdong and Fujian, drifted overseas and migrated to Indonesia to make a living. For thousands of years, overseas Chinese laborers have shared weal and woe with the Indonesian people, worked hard to develop local resources and develop the local economy, and have made certain contributions. According to historical records, as early as 942 AD, many Chinese were engaged in agricultural production in Sumatra and brought Chinese agricultural tools and agricultural production technology there. Tea was introduced to Indonesia by overseas Chinese. The world-famous Javanese sugar industry has been developed due to the introduction of advanced sugar cane planting experience and sugar extraction technology by overseas Chinese. In addition, the tobacco plantations on the eastern coast of Sumatra, the pepper gardens on Bangka Island and Belitung, the fishing industry in An Yabi, and the timber logging industry in Sulawesi and Kalimantan were mostly pioneered and developed by overseas Chinese workers. In the suburbs of various cities in Indonesia, there are many overseas Chinese who grow vegetables, fruits, and raise livestock and poultry to provide non-staple foods for the local people. In the rubber plantations, tobacco plantations, tin mines, gold mines, and oil mines operated by Western colonialists, there are more overseas Chinese workers working. Indonesia's tin production ranks second in the world, and most of the workers employed in its largest tin mine—the Bangka and Belitung tin mines (originally owned by the Netherlands)—are still Chinese workers. Overseas Chinese have also made arduous efforts in the establishment and development of several large cities in Indonesia, such as Jakarta and Medan.

Brutally Banning Overseas Chinese Small Traders and Hawkers is Harmful to Both Others and Oneself

Mr. Zhang Guoji then talked about the nature and role of the overseas Chinese economy. He said that since Western colonialism invaded Indonesia, the development of the local commodity economy and the differentiation of social classes have accelerated. Among the overseas Chinese, a small number of people have gradually risen to the bourgeoisie, but most of the overseas Chinese are still working people. Among the overseas Chinese laborers, there are urban workers, agricultural workers, shop assistants, small traders and hawkers, and other laborers. Overseas Chinese small traders and hawkers are individual commercial laborers, mainly relying on their own labor. Although some of them have slight exploitation of the working people, they are more exploited by foreign monopoly capital and the local bourgeoisie. Most of them live in the countryside, and generally have lived locally for several generations. They have rich experience in distribution and have played a positive and beneficial role in communicating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and serving the local people. Therefore, banning them without making sufficient preparations to enable these small traders and hawkers to obtain other means of livelihood and replacing them with new distribution institutions will not only damage the legitimate rights and interests of this part of the overseas Chinese, but also bring difficulties to Indonesia's national economic life. The number of overseas Chinese bourgeoisie accounts for only about 10% of the overseas Chinese population. The small and medium-sized enterprises they operate, like the enterprises operated by the local national bourgeoisie, have a positive effect on the development of Indonesia's economy, and the profits they obtain are still invested in local economic undertakings. As for the very few overseas Chinese capitalists who engage in certain improper operations, this is opposed by the broad masses of overseas Chinese; the broad masses of overseas Chinese also agree with the Indonesian government's banning of this part of improper economic activities. It can be seen that the overseas Chinese economy is an integral part of Indonesia's national economy and has consistently played a positive role in Indonesia's economy. Some people slander the overseas Chinese economy as "the remnants of colonialist economy," which is a complete distortion of facts and ulterior motives.

Overseas Chinese Once Shed Blood for the Indonesian People's Struggle for and Maintenance of National Independence

Mr. Zhang Guoji also listed facts to illustrate that overseas Chinese have consistently supported the Indonesian people's struggle against colonialism and for national independence. He said that since the Western colonialist forces invaded Indonesia, overseas Chinese and Indonesian people have similarly suffered the plunder, devastation, and oppression of the colonial rulers. On the basis of converging interests, they strengthened their unity and launched successive struggles against the colonial rulers. For example, in the "Red Creek" incident in 1740, overseas Chinese and Indonesian people fought heroically against the Dutch colonial rulers with common hatred, and the blood of the Chinese and Indonesian people was spilled on the beautiful land of Indonesia. During the period when Japanese imperialism occupied Indonesia, overseas Chinese cooperated with the local people in anti-Japanese activities, and the general overseas Chinese also generally adopted a non-cooperative attitude towards the Japanese army. After Indonesia declared its independence in 1945, the broad masses of overseas Chinese warmly sympathized with and supported Indonesia's national independence struggle. Many overseas Chinese directly participated in the armed struggle against the British and Dutch troops who invaded Indonesia. When US imperialism instigated the Indonesian rebel group to launch a rebellion in 1958, overseas Chinese actively supported the Indonesian people's struggle against US imperialist interference from the perspectives of public opinion and action, and assisted the Indonesian government in maintaining social order and stabilizing prices. The Indonesian government was very moved and said to the overseas Chinese: "You are truly sincerely assisting us in our work and struggle." In addition to supporting each other in the anti-colonialist struggle, overseas Chinese and local people have also carried out friendly activities of mutual assistance, cultural welfare in the spirit of "sharing the same boat," such as mutual relief in the event of disasters, and overseas Chinese raising funds to help build schools locally. In this way, in the long-term common struggle and common life, overseas Chinese have formed a close friendship with the Indonesian people.

For the Past Decade, Overseas Chinese Have Consistently Followed the Teachings of Their Motherland and Lived in Harmony with the Indonesian People

Mr. Zhang Guoji then said that after the founding of the People's Republic of China, overseas Chinese, in accordance with the motherland's peaceful foreign policy and following the motherland's teachings, have consistently supported Indonesia's national independence struggle, helped the Indonesian people develop their economy, respected local laws and customs, did not participate in local political activities, and have always lived in harmony with the Indonesian people. They are China's envoys of peace and friendship, and have played a good role in promoting the development of friendly relations between China and Indonesia, economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two countries. As for the very few overseas Chinese (mainly Chiang Kai-shek elements) who have done some bad things that are detrimental to Indonesia's national independence cause, this has always been resolutely opposed by the broad masses of overseas Chinese. Imperialists and anti-Chinese elements in Indonesia have repeatedly slandered overseas Chinese as the "fifth column," which is a deliberate attempt to provoke the relationship between the people of China and Indonesia, and is also to cover up imperialist aggression and subversive activities against Indonesia.

Mr. Zhang Guoji finally expressed his hope that the Indonesian government will respect the wishes of the broad masses of Indonesian people, give priority to the friendship between China and Indonesia, immediately take measures to stop all anti-Chinese activities, and accept Foreign Minister Chen Yi's proposal to send representatives from the two governments to conduct negotiations in order to comprehensively resolve the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia on the basis of friendly consultations.

### 华侨和印度尼西亚人民同甘苦共患难  排华活动违背正义为两国人民所不容  我全国人民代表大会代表、归国华侨张国基发表谈话

    华侨和印度尼西亚人民同甘苦共患难
    排华活动违背正义为两国人民所不容
    我全国人民代表大会代表、归国华侨张国基发表谈话
    新华社12日讯　中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表、曾经旅居印度尼西亚数十年之久的归国华侨张国基先生今天向新华社记者发表谈话时，表示热烈支持中国外交部长陈毅在12月9日写给印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约的信中提出的关于全面解决印度尼西亚华侨问题的建议。他说，中国政府的出发点是为了维护中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的友谊和保护印度尼西亚华侨的正当权益。这些建议是公正合理的，并且完全符合和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的精神。中国政府的建议必将获得中国和印度尼西亚两国广大人民的拥护。
    张国基先生对最近在印度尼西亚掀起的大规模排华活动表示极大的愤慨。他说：华侨同印度尼西亚人民千百年来友好相处，华侨对印度尼西亚的经济发展有相当的贡献，并且一贯支持印度尼西亚人民反殖民主义的斗争。中国政府在印度尼西亚遇到困难的时候，也总是尽力帮助。但是，今天印度尼西亚竟把华侨当作敌国侨民对待，并且粗暴地对他们进行迫害和歧视，这是违背正义和公理的，不但为六亿五千万中国人民所坚决反对，也为印度尼西亚广大人民所不容。
    华侨为印度尼西亚经济发展付出辛勤劳动作出重要贡献
    张国基先生接着详尽地谈到华侨移居印度尼西亚的历史和他们对当地的贡献。他说：在印度尼西亚的华侨同殖民主义国家的侨民完全不同。殖民主义国家的侨民到印度尼西亚去，是以炮舰为后盾，以掠夺当地人民的劳动果实为目的，而华侨则是以劳动者的身份为了谋生而去印度尼西亚的。华侨移居印度尼西亚虽然早在一千五百年前就已开始，但大量迁移还是近代的事。十七世纪初至十八世纪中叶，荷兰殖民主义者侵占印度尼西亚后，从中国沿海掳掠拐骗了大批契约华工到印度尼西亚为其开拓殖民地。近百余年来，旧中国在帝国主义的疯狂侵略和国内反动黑暗统治下，农村破产，失业人口增多，沿海各省，特别是广东、福建两省的广大贫苦农民大批地漂洋过海，迁移到印度尼西亚谋生。千百年来，华侨劳动者与印度尼西亚人民一起，同甘共苦，为开发当地资源、发展当地经济付出了艰苦的劳动，并且作出了一定的贡献。据历史记载，早在公元942年就有很多华人在苏门答腊从事农业生产，并且把中国的农具和农业生产技术带到那里。茶叶是由华侨传入印度尼西亚的。世界闻名的爪哇糖业，由于华侨传入了先进的种蔗经验和榨糖技术而得到了发展。另如苏门答腊东部沿岸的烟草园、邦加岛和勿里洞的胡椒园、岸亚比的捕鱼业、苏拉威西省和加里曼丹省的木材采伐业，大部分也是由华侨工人辛苦开拓和发展起来的。印度尼西亚的各个城郊都有许多华侨种植蔬菜瓜果，饲养牲畜家禽，为当地人民提供副食品。而在西方殖民主义者所经营的橡胶园、烟草园、锡矿、金矿、石油矿等企业中，则有更多的华侨工人在劳动。印度尼西亚的锡产量居世界第二位，而它的最大锡矿——邦加、勿里洞锡矿（原属荷兰所有）所雇佣的工人，直到现在大部分还是华工。在雅加达、棉兰等印度尼西亚的几个大城市的建立和发展过程中，华侨也曾付出辛勤的劳动。
        粗暴取缔华侨小商小贩既损人也不利己
    张国基先生接着谈到华侨经济的性质和作用问题。他说，自从西方殖民主义侵入印度尼西亚后，当地商品经济的发展和社会阶级的分化加速了。在华侨中，有一小部分人逐渐上升为资产阶级，但大部分华侨仍是劳动人民。在华侨劳动者中，有城市工人、农业工人、店员、小商小贩和其他劳动者。华侨小商小贩是个体商业劳动者，主要依靠自己劳动为主。虽然他们当中的一部分人对劳动人民有轻微的剥削，但是他们受到外国垄断资本和当地资产阶级更大的剥削。他们多半住在农村，一般在当地居住已有几代的历史，在分配方面具有较丰富的经验，对沟通当地城乡物资交流和为当地人民服务方面起了积极有益的作用。因此，在没有作好充分准备使这些小商小贩获得另外的谋生手段并以新的分配机构代替他们之前就把他们取缔，这将不仅损害这部分华侨的正当权益，而且将给印度尼西亚的国民经济生活带来困难。华侨资产阶级的人数只占华侨人口的10％左右。他们经营的中小型企业和当地民族资产阶级所经营的企业一样，对于发展印度尼西亚的经济具有积极的作用，他们所获得的利润仍投放于当地的经济事业。至于极少数的华侨资本家从事于某些不正当的经营，这是为广大华侨所反对的；印度尼西亚政府对这一部分不正当的经济活动加以取缔，广大华侨也是赞同的。由此可见，华侨经济是印度尼西亚国民经济的一个组成部分，对印度尼西亚的经济一贯起积极的作用。有些人诬蔑华侨经济为“殖民主义经济残余”，这是完全歪曲事实和别有用心的。
          华侨曾为印度尼西亚人民争取和维护民族独立流出了鲜血
    张国基先生还列举事实，说明华侨一贯支持印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争。他说，自从西方殖民主义势力侵入印度尼西亚后，华侨和印度尼西亚人民同样遭受到殖民统治者的掠夺、摧残和压迫，他们在利害一致的基础上加强团结，对殖民统治者展开了前仆后继的斗争。如在1740年的“红溪”事件中，华侨和印度尼西亚人民同仇敌忾，向荷兰殖民统治者进行了英勇的斗争，中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的鲜血同洒在印度尼西亚美丽的土地上。日本帝国主义侵占印度尼西亚时期，华侨配合当地人民进行了抗日活动，一般华侨也对日军普遍采取不合作的态度。1945年印度尼西亚宣告独立后，广大华侨都热烈同情和支持印度尼西亚的民族独立斗争。许多华侨直接参加了对侵略印度尼西亚的英国军队和荷军的武装斗争。1958年美帝国主义策动印度尼西亚叛乱集团发动叛乱时，华侨又从舆论和行动上积极支持印度尼西亚人民进行反对美帝国主义干涉的斗争，协助印度尼西亚政府维持社会秩序，稳定物价。印度尼西亚政府很感动地对华侨说：“你们真是诚心协助我们工作和斗争的。”除了在反殖民主义斗争中互相支持外，华侨还和当地人民本着“同舟共济”的精神，开展互助互济、文化福利的友好活动，如在发生灾害时互相救济，华侨募款帮助当地兴建学校等。就这样，在长期的共同斗争和共同生活中，华侨与印度尼西亚人民结成了亲密的友谊。
    华侨近十年来一贯遵循祖国教导与印度尼西亚人民友好相处
    张国基先生接着说，中华人民共和国成立后，华侨根据祖国的和平外交政策并遵循祖国的教导，一贯支持印度尼西亚的民族独立斗争，帮助印度尼西亚人民发展经济，尊重当地的法令和习惯，不参加当地的政治活动，并且始终不渝地和印度尼西亚人民友好相处。他们是中国的和平友好使者，对促进中国和印度尼西亚两国友好关系的发展，两国的经济合作和文化交流起了良好的作用。至于极少数华侨（主要是蒋帮分子）曾经作了一些不利于印度尼西亚民族独立事业的坏事，这是一向为广大华侨所坚决反对的。帝国主义和印度尼西亚的排华分子口口声声诬蔑华侨为“第五纵队”，这是蓄意挑拨中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的关系，也是为了掩盖帝国主义对印度尼西亚的侵略和颠覆活动。
    张国基先生最后表示，希望印度尼西亚政府尊重印度尼西亚广大人民的愿望，以中国和印度尼西亚两国友谊为重，立即采取措施停止排华的一切活动，并且接受陈毅外长的建议，由两国政府派出代表进行谈判，以便在友好协商的基础上全面地解决印度尼西亚华侨的问题。
