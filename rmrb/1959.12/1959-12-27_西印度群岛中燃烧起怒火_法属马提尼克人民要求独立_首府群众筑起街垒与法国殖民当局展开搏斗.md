Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 26th: According to reports in Parisian newspapers, residents of Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique, held a public demonstration demanding independence.

Martinique, located in the West Indies (Latin America), is currently under French control. French colonialists consider it an overseas department. Some political parties and groups in Martinique are demanding a change in this status.

On the 21st, when the French authorities in Martinique used force to disperse a public gathering demanding independence, they even opened fire on the demonstrating masses, killing two people. Enraged by the atrocities of the French authorities, the demonstrating masses rose up in self-defense, building barricades in the streets of Fort-de-France and burning down some French police stations.

The French have declared a curfew in Fort-de-France from 8:00 PM to dawn the next day in an attempt to control the situation, but it is reported that the unrest against French colonial rule by the people of Martinique continued until the 24th.

The French government hurriedly dispatched additional troops to Martinique for suppression. In addition to already drawing troops from the neighboring island of Guadeloupe, on the 25th, the 8,500-ton cruiser "De Grasse" carrying approximately 1,000 soldiers set sail from Brest, France, for Martinique.

　　西印度群岛中燃烧起怒火
    法属马提尼克人民要求独立
    首府群众筑起街垒与法国殖民当局展开搏斗
    新华社巴黎26日电　据巴黎报纸报道，马提尼克岛首府法兰西堡的居民举行了要求独立的公众示威。
    位于西印度群岛（拉丁美洲）的马提尼克岛，现在在法国人控制下，法国殖民主义者把它算作一个海外省，马提尼克一些政党和团体要求改变这种地位。
    马提尼克法国当局在21日以武力驱散要求独立的公众时，竟向示威群众开枪，打死了两个人。被法国当局暴行激怒的示威群众起而自卫，他们在法兰西堡的街道上筑起了街垒，并且烧掉了一些法国的警察局。
    法国已经宣布在法兰西堡从晚上八时到次日黎明实行戒严，以图控制局势，但是据报道，一直到24日，马提尼克人民反对法国殖民统治的骚动仍在继续着。
    法国政府慌忙增调军队到马提尼克去镇压，除了已经从邻近的瓜德罗普岛抽调部队去以外，25日，一艘八千五百吨的巡洋舰德格拉斯号载着约一千名军队从法国的布勒斯特起程前往马提尼克。
