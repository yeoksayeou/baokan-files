Hold High the Red Flag of the General Line and Build a New Mountain Area in Tonghua
Yin Zuoxu, Secretary of the Tonghua Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jilin

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the correct leadership of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, the Tonghua area has achieved remarkable success in politics, economy, and culture. In 1958, under the radiant light of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the people of the entire region achieved the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune system. Their spirits are even more vigorous and their fighting will is even higher. Currently, with the momentum of a massive mass movement, they are building the Tonghua mountain area into a new socialist mountain area.

The Tonghua area is located in the rich Changbai Mountains. Forests are one of the region's most important resources, with forest land accounting for 67.9% of the total area and a very abundant timber reserve. Underground, there are large coalfields and iron ore deposits, as well as more than 20 other minerals such as gold, copper, aluminum, asbestos, Iceland spar, and crystal. The area also abounds in the famous "Three Treasures of Northeast China"—ginseng, mink fur, and deer antlers—as well as various precious wild animals and more than 400 kinds of wild plants and medicinal herbs that can be used for papermaking, winemaking, oil extraction, and medicine production. What valuable resources! Truly "inexhaustible and inexhaustible."

However, before liberation, due to the long-term rule of the enemy and puppets, who carried out robber-style plundering, the resources here were destroyed, and the mountain people lived a painful life of epidemic diseases, "inadequate clothing and food," and even family separations and deaths.

Only under the leadership of the Party, with the victory of the revolution, and with the power in the hands of the people, social productive forces were liberated, and the vitality of the rich mountain area awakened. Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party, through a series of democratic and socialist revolutionary movements, especially under the radiant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, since 1958, the region's industrial and agricultural production and various socialist construction undertakings have been developing rapidly. The impoverished mountain area of the old society is gone forever.

1958 was a year of great historical significance. In steel production, the principle of "walking on two legs" was implemented, combining indigenous and modern methods, and a massive mass movement was launched. This not only produced a large amount of steel in that year but also trained a large number of cadres and cultivated technical personnel. This year, the iron and steel base, centered on the Tonghua Iron and Steel Company, is being gradually built, and steel production has seen even greater development. According to statistics compiled before National Day, the production of pig iron increased by 4.3 times compared to 1958. This marks the permanent end to the history of not being able to produce steel. The development of other industries such as coal and electricity has also increased several times over the past.

Agricultural production has also greatly developed. In the early days of liberation, due to past destruction by the enemy and puppets, serious soil erosion occurred, and the yield per unit area was very low. Over the past ten years, basic agricultural construction such as soil and water conservation and water conservancy projects has been gradually carried out, and the yield per unit area has been increasing year by year. In 1958, the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture was further implemented, and grain production also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output increased by 63.1% compared to 1949, and the average yield per hectare reached 4,310 jin, an increase of 55.36% compared to 1949. The average grain possession per person reached 1,422 jin, and most cities and counties in the region have reached or are close to completing the grain yield per unit area target of the Twelve-Year National Programme for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule, thereby achieving self-sufficiency in grain and laying a favorable foundation for the continued leap forward in agriculture.

While developing grain production, diversified operations have also achieved unprecedented development. The cultivation area of ginseng reached 2.27 million square meters in 1958, and there were more than 2,000 deer raised. The annual output of various medicinal materials reached more than 700,000 jin. In 1959, the area of cultivated wild medicinal materials reached more than 3,000 mu, an increase of 290 times compared to 1949, and it has now become one of the province's medicinal material bases. The cultivation of various fruit trees reached 2.3 million trees in 1959, an increase of 47 times compared to ten years ago. The annual output of wild grapes reached 4 million jin, which is the main raw material for the famous Tonghua wine. Other industries such as forestry, winemaking, oil extraction, and chemical industry have also greatly developed.

The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production has driven the great development of transportation, finance and trade, culture, education, health, and other undertakings, greatly improving the living conditions of the mountain people. Currently, the region has 3,216 kilometers of highways, more than 500 kilometers of railways, and more than 540 kilometers of forest railways. A transportation network with highways and railways extending in all directions has been formed throughout the region. In 1958, the region's purchasing power increased by 2.47 times compared to 1949, and the total retail sales of social commodities increased by nine times compared to 1949. Even remote mountain villages can buy necessary commodities. Primary school education has been universalized throughout the region, with the number of primary school students increasing from 60,752 before liberation to 210,902. The number of middle school students increased from 3,008 to 32,032. In 1958, a new higher normal college was built, creating conditions for training middle school teachers. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated among young and middle-aged people. Cultural centers, clubs, radio stations, cinemas, film projection teams, and theatrical troupes have been established in both urban and rural areas, and the cultural life of the mountain people has become more active. The number of hospitals has increased from seven to twenty-seven. The number of medical personnel has reached 6,568, an increase of more than five times compared to ten years ago. Due to the development of health services and the care of the Party and government for the mountain people, effective prevention and treatment methods have been developed for "Keshan disease." The mountain people sing praises for this: "The Communist Party is really good, sending doctors to treat us, curing our Keshan disease, and boosting our enthusiasm for production." Now, the people love the Party, Chairman Mao, and the mountains even more. Building a new socialist mountain area has become the action slogan of the mountain people.

The tremendous changes that have taken place in the Tonghua area in the past ten years in politics, economy, and culture are inseparable from the leadership of the Party. We have deeply realized in the process of developing mountain production that strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, earnestly implementing the Party's general line, and implementing the Party's policies and guidelines are the fundamental guarantees for achieving great victories. The Party's leadership is the guarantee of victory for all revolutionary undertakings, and there is no socialism without the Party's leadership. This is a truth that has long been proven in practice. The Party's correct leadership plays a decisive role in the enormous development of the Changbai Mountain area's economy and the continuous improvement of people's lives.

The Party Central Committee's policy for developing production in the mountain area is fully in line with the vital interests of the mountain people. However, in the process of implementing the Party's policies and guidelines, some people have doubts about the Party's policies, and even have resistance, believing that "the mountain area is backward and difficult to build." Regarding the implementation of the policy of vigorously developing diversified operations on the basis of grain self-sufficiency, some people also have resistance, believing that "the mountain climate is cold and the soil layer is thin, and grain production has limited increase," advocating more sideline production and less grain production. They only emphasize local interests and ignore overall interests. These ideas were and are wrong. In diversified operations, some people only care about immediate interests and disregard long-term interests, only willing to engage in some highly profitable varieties and unwilling to engage in basic farmland construction. In addition, some people are not content with working and producing in the mountain area. These situations show that there is a struggle between two roads and two ideologies regarding mountain area construction. Facts have educated us that, in order to implement the Party's policies and guidelines and rapidly develop the mountain area economy, we must refute all kinds of right-leaning ideas and eliminate the ideological obstacles of some people. To this end, we have launched debates among the vast number of cadres and the masses. Through the mass line method of great airing of views, great debates, and great discussions, we used facts to refute various erroneous statements, thereby safeguarding the Party's general line. In particular, after widely conducting socialist and communist education and education on the prospects of developing the mountain area among the masses, we universally improved the communist consciousness of the masses, overcame the "eat the mountain without nourishing the mountain" "quick-fist" thinking of some of the masses, and established the idea and determination to build the mountain area for a long time. Practice has proven that only by persisting in the constant struggle against various right-leaning conservative ideas, and by correctly conducting propaganda and education to the masses, can we guarantee the correct implementation of the Party's general line, and the Party's policies and guidelines. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over mountain production, we have, in accordance with the spirit of the central government's instructions, delegated nearly 6,000 cadres, who not only closely linked the Party with the masses and trained themselves, but also ensured the smooth implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines.

Chairman Mao often taught us: The people are truly great, and the creativity of the masses is endless. There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome by relying on the masses. Chairman Mao's instructions gave us unparalleled strength and confidence to overcome difficulties. The rapid development of the mountain area economy in the past ten years is the result of widely mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and launching a massive mass movement.

Under the leadership of the Party, the mountain farmers, through the road of mutual aid and cooperation, have accumulated experience in organizing and developing mountain production. In 1958, on the basis of advanced cooperatives, 79 people's communes were formed, comprehensively realizing the communization of the mountain people. After the establishment of the people's communes, in just over a year, the superiority of their "large size and high degree of public ownership" has been fully demonstrated. Especially in the mountain areas with sparse population, scattered areas, and a wide range of production avenues, the organization of the people's communes is more conducive to the rational allocation and use of labor, the full utilization of the abundant resources of the mountain areas, the comprehensive development of the mountain area economy, and the acceleration of the integrated development of industry, agriculture (including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery), commerce, education, and military affairs. Soon after the establishment of the communes last year, due to the organization of communist large-scale cooperation and the launch of a massive mass movement, they were not only able to seize a bumper harvest in agriculture during the busy farming season, but also deeply ploughed large areas of land, and carried out large-scale water conservancy construction, creating conditions for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. They also established more than 2,000 small-scale commune-run industries, transferred more than 100,000 laborers, and launched an unprecedented battle to dig coal, seize minerals, and smelt iron. The entire region smelted more than 10,000 tons of iron and more than 1,000 tons of steel in just over two months. While smelting iron and steel, it also developed two iron mines with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of tons, built and expanded five coal mines with considerable scale, and established many small and medium-sized industrial enterprises that did not exist in the past. It newly built and repaired four hundred and thirty-four kilometers of roads, creating a material foundation for the further development of the mountain area economy. To build the mountain area, it is also necessary to conduct overall planning to make the broad masses of people clear about the direction and strengthen their confidence. In recent years, on the one hand, we have educated the masses on nourishing the mountains, protecting the mountains, and cherishing the mountain resources; on the other hand, we have actively started to conduct a general survey of the mountain resources and formulated a plan for the economic development of the mountain area, so that the masses have a clear direction of struggle and confidence. In the process of formulating the plan, we adhered to the mass line and adopted the method of combining "from top to bottom and from bottom to top." Because the various development plans for agriculture, forestry, sideline occupations, and animal husbandry were all formulated using this mass line method, they are relatively practical and easily accepted by the masses. At the same time, it has also overcome some of the blindness in carrying out economic construction in the mountain area, solved some contradictions in developing mountain production, coordinated the working steps of various departments, and made mountain construction have a relatively complete method. After formulating the plan for developing the mountain area economy, we conducted extensive propaganda and education among the masses, calling on the people of the entire Tonghua area to build the Tonghua area into a prosperous and happy new socialist mountain area, further inspiring the enthusiasm of the mountain people. The masses said: "With a clear direction for planning, the mountain area has a future for development. We feel bright in our hearts and full of enthusiasm to build a new mountain area in Tonghua."

The achievements in the construction of the Tonghua mountain area in the past ten years are great, but this is only the first step. The extraordinarily rich resources of the Changbai Mountains are still waiting for people to develop and utilize, so its prospects are bright and brilliant. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, and under the radiant light of the Party's general line, the people of the entire region will make new and greater achievements. Let the people of our Tonghua area unite closely with the people of the whole country and the whole province, unite around the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, hold high the red flag of the general line, and continue to bravely advance on the broad road of socialism!

    高举总路线的红旗建设通化新山区
    中共吉林通化地委书记　尹作序
    通化专区在党中央和毛主席的英明领导和吉林省委的正确领导下，在政治、经济、文化等方面都取得显著的成就。1958年，全区人民在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，实现了大跃进和人民公社化，意气更加风发，斗志更加昂扬，目前正以气势磅礴之势的群众运动，把通化山区建设成一个社会主义的新山区。
    通化专区位于富饶的长白山区。森林是全区重要富源之一，林地面积占总面积的67.9％，木材蓄积量非常丰富。地下有蕴藏量很大的煤田、铁矿，还有金、铜、铝、石绵、冰洲石、水晶等二十余种矿藏。这里还盛产中外驰名的关东三宝——人参、貂皮、鹿茸角，以及各种珍贵的野生动物和四百多种可供制纸、制酒、制油、制药的野生植物、野生药材。多么宝贵的资源啊！真是“取之不尽，用之不竭”的。
    但是，在解放前，由于敌伪长期统治，进行强盗式的掠夺，这里的资源遭到破坏，山区人民长期过着疫病流行、“衣不蔽体，食不果腹”，以至妻离子散、家破人亡的痛苦生活。
      只有在党的领导下，革命胜利了，政权掌握在人民手里，解放了社会生产力，富饶山区的生命力苏醒了。十年来，全区人民在党的领导下，经过一系列的民主革命和社会主义革命运动，特别是在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，从1958年以来，全区工农业生产以及各项社会主义建设事业正在一日千里地向前发展，旧社会遗留下来的贫困的山区面貌已一去不复返了。
    1958年是有伟大历史意义的一年，在钢铁生产中，贯彻了“土洋并举”两条腿走路的方针，大搞群众运动，不仅在当年生产了大量的钢铁，而且锻炼了大批干部，培养了技术人员。今年，以通化钢铁公司为中心的钢铁基地正在逐步建成，钢铁生产有了更大的发展。截至国庆前夕统计，生铁的产量比1958年增长了四点三倍。从此永远结束了不能生产钢铁的历史。其它如煤炭、电力等工业的发展也比过去有了好几倍的增长。
    农业生产也有很大发展。在解放初期，因为过去遭受敌伪的破坏，水土严重流失，单位面积产量很低，十年来逐步进行了水土保持、兴修水利等农业基本建设，单位面积产量逐年有所提高。1958年进一步贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，粮食生产也获得了空前的丰收。粮食总产量比1949年增长了63.1％，平均每公顷单产达到四千三百一十斤，比1949年增长55.36％。每人平均占有粮食一千四百二十二斤，全地区多数市县已提前达到或接近完成十二年农业发展纲要的粮食单产指标，从而做到了粮食自给有余，为农业的继续跃进打下有利的基础。
    在发展粮食生产的同时，多种经营也有了空前的发展。人参的培植面积1958年已达二百二十七万平方米，养鹿达二千余只，各种药材年产达七十余万斤；1959年家植的野生药材面积三千余亩，比1949年增长二百九十倍，现在已成为全省药材基地之一。各种果树的栽培，1959年达二百三十万株，比十年前增长四十七倍；山葡萄的年产量达四百万斤，它是著名通化葡萄酒的主要原料。其他如森林工业、制酒制油、化学工业，都有很大的发展。
    工农业生产的大跃进，带动了交通运输业、财贸、文教卫生等各项事业的大发展，使山区人民的生活条件有了很大改善。目前全区已有公路三千二百一十六公里，铁路长达五百多公里，森林铁路长五百四十多公里。全区已形成一个公路、铁路四通八达的交通网。1958年全区购买力比1949年增长了二点四七倍，社会商品零售额比1949年提高了九倍，偏僻的山沟同样可以买到必需的商品。全区小学教育已普及了，小学生由解放前的六万零七百五十二人增加到二十一万零九百零二人；中学生由三千零八人增加到三万二千零三十二人。1958年新建一所高等专科师范学校，为培养中学师资创造了条件。在青壮年中，基本上扫除了文盲。在城乡普遍建立了文化馆、俱乐部、广播站、影院、电影放映队、剧团，山区人民的文化生活更加活跃。卫生院由原来的七处发展到二十七处；医务人员已达六千五百六十八人，比十年前增加五倍多。由于卫生事业的发展，党和政府对山区人民的关怀，对“大骨节”病已有了有效的防治办法。山区人民为此歌颂：“共产党真正好，派出医生来治疗，治好我们的大骨节，生产热情干劲高。”现在人民更加热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱山区，建设社会主义的新山区，成为山区人民的行动口号。
    十年来通化地区在政治、经济、文化等方面能够发生这样巨大变化，是与党的领导分不开的。我们在发展山区生产过程中深深体会到：加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻党的总路线，贯彻执行党的方针政策，这是取得伟大胜利的根本保证。党的领导是一切革命事业胜利的保证，没有党的领导就没有社会主义，这是实践中早已证明了的真理。长白山区的经济能有如此巨大的发展，人民生活能够不断改善，党的正确领导起着决定的作用。
    党中央对山区发展生产的方针是完全符合山区人民切身利益的。但是在执行党的方针政策过程中，也有一些人对党的方针持有怀疑态度，甚至有抵触情绪，认为：“山区落后，难以建设”。对于执行在粮食自给的基础上大力发展多种经营的方针，也有些人有抵触情绪，他们认为“山区气候冷、土层薄，粮食增产有限”，主张多搞副业，少搞粮食生产。他们只强调局部利益，忽略了整体利益。这些思想，在过去和现在都是错误的。在多种经营上，有的人只顾眼前利益，不顾长远利益，只愿意搞一些利润多的品种，不愿搞农田基本建设。此外，还有一些人不安心于山区工作和生产。这些情况说明，对待山区建设存在着两条道路、两种思想的斗争。事实教育了我们，为了贯彻党的方针政策，迅速地发展山区经济，必须驳斥各种各样的右倾思想，消除一部分人的思想障碍。为此，我们曾在广大干部和群众中展开了辩论，通过大鸣、大放、大辩论的群众路线方法，用事实驳斥了各种错误言论，从而维护了党的总路线。特别是经过在群众中广泛地进行了社会
  主义和共产主义的教育和发展山区远景的教育之后，普遍地提高了群众的共产主义觉悟，克服部分群众中的“吃山不养山”的“打快拳”思想，树立长期建设山区的思想和决心。实践证明，只有坚持不断地向各种右倾保守思想进行斗争，并向群众正确地进行宣传教育，才能保证党的总路线，党的方针、政策正确地贯彻执行。为了加强党对山区生产的领导，我们曾经根据中央指示精神，下放了近六千名干部，这批干部，不仅密切了党与群众的联系，锻炼了他们自己，也保证了党的方针、政策顺利地贯彻执行。
    毛主席经常教导我们：人民群众是真正伟大的，群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，依靠群众没有克服不了的困难。主席的指示给了我们以克服困难的无比力量和信心。十年来山区经济所以能够迅速发展，就是广泛发动群众、依靠群众，大搞群众运动的结果。
    山区农民在党的领导下，经过互助合作道路，积累了组织起来、发展山区生产的经验。1958年，在高级合作社的基础上，组成了七十九个人民公社，全面地实现了山区人民公社化。人民公社建立后，一年多的时间，充分显示了它的“一大二公”的优越性。特别是在山区人少分散，地区辽阔，生产门路广的情况下，人民公社的组织就更便于合理的调剂使用劳动力，充分地利用山区丰富资源，全面地发展山区经济，加速工农（包括农林牧副渔）商学兵的综合发展。去年建立公社不久，由于组织了共产主义的大协作，大搞群众运动，因此能够在农事繁忙的季节里不仅夺取了农业的大丰收，对大面积的土地进行了深翻，进行了大规模的水利建设，为今年农业大丰收创造了条件，而且还兴办了二千余处小型社办工业，抽调了十万余名劳动力，开展了空前未有的挖煤夺矿、炼铁大战，全区仅两个多月的时间就炼铁一万余吨，炼钢一千余吨。在大炼钢铁的同时，还开发了两处年产数十万吨的铁矿，新建扩建五处具有相当规模的煤矿，并创办了许多过去所没有的中小型工业企业，新修补修公路四条四百三十四公里，为进一步开发山区经济创造了物质基础。建设山区还必须进行全面规划，使广大群众明确方向，坚定信心。几年来，我们一方面向群众进行了养山、护山、爱护山区资源的教育；一方面积极着手对山区资源进行普查工作，制定了山区经济发展规划，使群众有了明确的奋斗方向和信心。在制定规划的过程中，我们坚持走群众路线，采取“自上而下，自下而上”的上下结合的方法。由于农、林、副、牧等各种发展规划都是采取这种走群众路线的方法制订出来的，因此比较切实，群众易于接受。同时也克服了在山区进行经济建设工作的若干盲目性，解决了发展山区生产中的一些矛盾，协调了各部门的工作步骤，使山区建设有了一套比较完整的办法。在制定发展山区经济规划之后，我们又在群众中进行了广泛的宣传教育，号召全区人民把通化地区建设成为社会主义的繁荣幸福的新山区，进一步鼓舞了山区人民的干劲。群众说：“有了规划方向明，山区发展有前程，心里亮堂干劲大，建设通化新山区。”
    十年来通化山区的建设成就是巨大的，但这还只是第一步。长白山异常丰富的资源，还等待着人们去开发，去利用，因此它的前景是光辉灿烂的。全区人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在省委的领导下，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，将会作出新的更大的成绩来。让我们通化地区的人民同全国、全省人民紧密地团结起来，团结在党和毛泽东同志的周围，高举总路线的红旗，继续向社会主义的康庄大道奋勇前进吧！
