    Fifteen Years Without a Single Pig Death
    On the Breeding and Epidemic Prevention Work of the Baijiagou Management Area

    The Baijiagou Management Area of the Lvliang Pioneer People's Commune in Xing County, Shanxi Province, has attached great importance to pig breeding and epidemic prevention work since it started the primary cooperative in 1944. For fifteen years, not a single pig has died. In the last six years, no sick pigs have appeared, allowing the pig-raising industry to flourish.

    Baijiagou is the most impoverished area in the barren mountains of Xing County. Before the cooperative, the yield per mu was only about forty jin. In good years, each person averaged only two hundred jin of grain. People lived a poor life of "half the year with bran and vegetables, half the year with grain, clothes scarce all year round, worrying about the child's survival after birth." In 1944, Communist Party member Comrade Jia Baozhi organized eight poor peasant households to establish a land cooperative combining labor and military affairs. However, this cooperative did not even have a single livestock hair. Comrade Jia Baozhi proposed: "Farming without manure is like blindly mixing; good crops cannot be separated from black treasure (referring to pigs). We cannot afford to raise cattle or horses, so let's raise a sow to start a family!" But how to buy pigs? Everyone was worried. Comrade Jia Baozhi "thought up" an idea: wouldn't it be good to draw out some labor to run transportation and earn money to buy pigs? Everyone said this method was good. Thus, the transportation work began, and day by day they accumulated some money. The government also lent them ten shi of millet. In the autumn, they bought six sows and thirty-one piglets, opened a tofu and noodle shop, and started a small collective pig farm. As the saying goes, "Easy come, easy go," but instead they treasured what came their way. All the men, women, and children in the cooperative regarded the pigs as precious as their own eyes and took extra care of them. One night, during a heavy thunderstorm, a sow in the Xigou pig farm contracted erysipelas. When cooperative member Wang Jiangshuan learned about it, he immediately wanted to find a pig doctor. Someone stopped him and said, "The flood in the gully is frightening, go tomorrow!" He said, "Erysipelas is very contagious, it's impossible to delay even a moment!" Pushing aside others, he risked his life to cross the waist-deep flood, traveled twenty li back and forth, and invited the pig doctor, who promptly cured the sick pig and prevented the spread of the disease. Because the cooperative members cared so much about the collective pig farm, each of their pigs grew big and round, with full fat and meat. Once this batch of pigs was sold, they earned 625 yuan in cash (equivalent to RMB), and used the money to buy two large livestock and fifty-six sheep. With more livestock and more manure, this year the grain yield per mu exceeded that of individual farmers by 10%. In this way, this collective pig farm laid a foundation for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. In addition to expanding the pig farm, they also mobilized cooperative members to raise pigs in every household. Thus, through self-breeding and self-raising, Baijiagou's pig-raising industry became more prosperous year by year. By 1952, they had raised more than five hundred pigs. In 1958, the pig-raising industry doubled compared to 1957, reaching 1,669 pigs. This year, due to the full utilization of the superiority of the people's commune – large-scale and collective – a feed base was established, and management was improved. On the one hand, the management area and production teams vigorously established pig farms, and on the other hand, they mobilized cooperative members to raise pigs in large quantities. Therefore, on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, it doubled again. In addition to selling a large number of meat pigs to the state and supporting fraternal communes with a large number of breeding pigs, there are now a total of 2,692 pigs of all sizes, averaging four and a half pigs per household and 1.2 pigs per person. The income from pig raising now accounts for 20% of the total agricultural income.

    In the course of fifteen years, the Baijiagou Management Area has bred and raised 9,952 pigs, and never has a single pig died due to illness, disaster (mountain disaster), or poor management. Moreover, since 1953, it has created a miracle of six consecutive years without sick pigs. How were these miracles created? What are their experiences?

    The most important thing is that on the basis of strengthening political and ideological education, through the system of designated personnel in charge, payment based on output, and evaluation and reward, the ideas of loving pigs like children and loving public pig raising more than private pig raising among the vast cadres and cooperative members have been further promoted and consolidated. From the management area to the production team, there is a responsible cadre specifically in charge of pig raising, and the feeders have clearly defined responsibilities. Due to the implementation of the advanced system of calculating remuneration based on output value, the principle of distribution according to work has been correctly implemented, promoting high quality and high yield, and preventing accidents of injury, illness, and death. At the same time, the evaluation and inspection system was adhered to, with an evaluation every quarter and a major evaluation at the end of the year, setting off a competitive upsurge. Because everyone has established the idea of ​​loving pigs like children and putting the public first and the private second, everyone has racked their brains to strengthen the feeding management and hygiene and epidemic prevention work of pigs.

    Second, select good breeds of pigs. Healthy pigs are not easily sick, and even if they are sometimes sick, they quickly recover after treatment. Conversely, weak pigs are prone to illness and are not easily cured when encountering serious illnesses. From the very beginning of establishing the pig farm fifteen years ago, they attached great importance to selecting superior breeds. The sows and boars kept for breeding are the best of the best. Because Baijiagou's pigs are large, grow meat quickly, are easy to feed, and have few problems, many neighboring places come to Baijiagou to buy piglets. In 1954, they bought a Soviet Large White pig. This pig is strong and has strong resistance to disease. Comrades Jia Baozhi and Jia Sanmeng personally drove the Large White pig to breed with pigs inside and outside the cooperative, and in three years achieved Soviet White pigization. Recently, Baijiagou has also bought back five superior boars, including Yorkshire, Berkshire, Ukrainian White pigs, and Harbin superior breeds. They will continue to improve pig breeds on the basis of Soviet White pigization.

    Third, grasp feeding with one hand and epidemic prevention with the other. Baijiagou has implemented a set of scientific feeding management methods, which is separate pen management and separate trough feeding. The pigsty is dry, clean, with sufficient sunshine, and good air circulation. Management is divided into pens according to male and female, meat pigs, large pigs, small pigs, good pigs, and sick pigs. Feeding is also divided into troughs and grades according to the above divisions. After each feeding, if it is found that some pigs are slow to eat well, they are left to eat extra food. Feeding time should be fixed, and the amount of feeding should also be quantified so that the pigs' lives are regularized. It should not be too late, too early, or too hungry, or too full. Pig food should be neither cold nor hot, generally not too hot in winter and not too cold in summer. When adding food to the trough, it should be thin first and then thick, less first and then more, gradually increasing. In this way, the pigs eat a lot, digest normally, do not have diarrhea, do not vomit food, and do not get sick. In addition, they also drive the pigs out of the pen every day to ventilate and chase them around once or twice at night to increase their activity.

    For pig diseases, they adopted the method of "seven parts prevention, three parts treatment," focusing on epidemic prevention. In case of disease, effective measures are taken to eliminate the disease in its early stages. Even though there have been no sick pigs for six consecutive years, they have never relaxed epidemic prevention and health care work.

    Baijiagou has formed a strict epidemic prevention network from top to bottom. The management area has a veterinary station, with a dedicated pig doctor and two assistants, complete with medicines and equipment, always maintaining a state of combat readiness. Each production team and pig farm has epidemic prevention personnel who conduct epidemic prevention inspections at any time. Once an epidemic occurs, those that can be treated are treated, and those that cannot be treated are quickly referred to the pig doctor.

    Years of experience have told them that the close combination of feeders and epidemic prevention personnel is a good method. They jointly studied and explored and found effective ways to prevent pig diseases. That is, in addition to vaccinations in summer, it is best to give pigs a sheep seasoning once to prevent swine fever. Another vaccination from the beginning of autumn to the Cold Dew can prevent erysipelas. Daily ventilation, grazing in spring, summer, and autumn, and frequent bathing in summer are all beneficial to pig fattening and health care.

    In order to prevent the spread of foreign epidemics, all foreign pigs entering or passing through must undergo strict health checks. And actively carry out epidemic prevention treatment for neighboring fraternal communes and districts and teams.

    Baijiagou established a Red and Expert School last year, and outstanding feeders Jia Sanmeng and pig doctor Jia Pengniu were hired as pig-raising instructors, regularly teaching pig-raising techniques. All the people in Baijiagou are also pig fans. Sanmeng and Pengniu have to receive several people who come to "learn the scriptures" almost every day. Therefore, their every new experience spreads throughout the entire management area in just three to five days, and every household has one or two pig-raising experts.

    十五年不死一头猪
    记白家沟管理区的饲养和防疫工作
    山西兴县吕梁先锋人民公社白家沟管理区，从1944年办起初级社起，就很重视猪的饲养和防疫工作，十五年来没有死过一头猪，最近六年没有发生病猪，使养猪事业蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。
    白家沟是兴县贫瘠山区中最贫瘠的地方。办社前，每亩地的单位产量只有四十来斤，遇上丰年，每人才平均二百多斤粮。人们一直过着“半年糠菜半年粮，一年四季少衣裳，睡觉不知铺和盖，生下孩子愁死娘”的穷苦日子。1944年，共产党员贾宝执同志组织八户贫农，办起了一个劳武结合的土地合作社。但是，这个社连一根牲畜毛也没有。贾宝执同志提议：“种地没粪，等于瞎混；庄稼要好，离不了黑宝（指猪）。养牛养马买不起，咱们喂一头母猪，起个家吧！”可是拿什么买猪呢？大家都发了愁。贾宝执同志“琢磨”出一个主意来：抽出一些劳力跑运输，赚下钱买猪不是很好么？这个办法一提出来，大家都说好。于是运输工作干开了，一天一天也就积攒了一些钱，政府又给贷了十石小米，到秋后他们就买下六头母猪和三十一头猪娃，开了一个豆腐场带粉场，办起了一个小小的集体猪场。俗话说：“来的不容易，爱的赛珍宝”。全社男女老少把猪看得像眼睛珠子一样，照顾得分外周到。有一天夜里下着大雷雨，西沟猪场一头母猪害上了丹毒。社员王缰拴知道了，马上要去找猪医生。有人拦住他说：“沟里洪水涨得怕人，明天再去吧！”他说：“丹毒传染很厉害，迟一刻也不行！”推开别人，冒着生命危险渡过了齐腰的洪水，往返跑了二十里，请来了猪医生，及时治好了那头病猪，避免了传染。因为社员是这样关心集体猪场，所以他们养的猪一头头都长得个大体圆，膘满肉肥。这批猪一出槽，他们收入现金六百二十五元（折合人民币），又用这些钱买了二头大牲畜和五十六只羊；牲畜多，粪多，这年粮食亩产超过单干农民10％。这个集体养猪场就这样给农业和畜牧业的发展打了个基础。他们除了扩大猪场以外，又发动社员家家都养猪，就这样，自繁自养，白家沟的养猪事业一年比一年兴旺。到1952年已养到五百多头，1958年养猪事业比1957年翻了一番，养到一千六百六十九头。今年，由于充分发挥了人民公社一大二公的优越性，建立了饲料基地，改进了经营管理，一面由管理区和生产队大办猪场，一面发动社员大量自养，因而在去年大跃进的基础上，又翻了一番，除卖给国家大量肉猪和支援兄弟公社大量种猪以外，现有大小猪共二千六百九十二头，每户平均四头半，每人平均一点二头，养猪收入已占农业总收入的20％。
    在十五年的过程中，白家沟管理区繁殖和喂养过九千九百五十二头猪，从来没有因病、因害（山害）、因管理不善死亡过一头，而且从1953年以来，创造了连续六年无病猪的奇迹。这些奇迹是怎样创造出来的呢？他们的经验是什么呢？
    最重要的是在加强政治思想教育的基础上，通过专人专管、以产计酬和评比奖励等制度，把广大干部和社员的爱猪如子与爱公养猪胜过爱私养猪的思想进一步发扬和巩固下来。从管理区到生产小队都有一个负责干部专管养猪，饲养员责任分明。由于推行了以产值计算报酬的先进制度，正确地贯彻了按劳取酬的原则，促进了优质高产，杜绝了伤病死亡事故。同时坚持了评比检查制度，每季一评比，年终大评比，掀起了你争我赶的竞赛热潮。由于人人树立了爱猪如子和先公后私的思想，大家都挖尽心思，加强猪的饲养管理和卫生防疫工作。
    第二，选用良种猪。体格健壮的猪，轻易得不了病，就是有时病了，一经治疗就很快恢复健康。反之，孱弱的猪就常肯闹病，遇上重病就不容易治好。十五年前一开始办猪场，他们就特别重视选用优种。留作繁殖的母猪和公猪，都是好的里边捡好的。因为，白家沟的猪个头大，长肉快，好喂养，毛病少，邻近好些地方都到白家沟去买小猪。1954年他们买回了一头苏联大白猪，这种猪体格健壮，对疾病的抵抗能力强。贾宝执和贾三孟同志亲自赶上大白猪给社内社外的猪配种，三年就实现了苏联白猪化。最近白家沟又买回五头优种公猪，其中有“约克夏”“巴客夏”乌克兰白猪和哈尔滨优种猪。他们将在苏联白猪化的基础上，继续改良猪种。
    第三，一手抓饲养，一手抓防疫。白家沟推行了一套科学的饲养管理方法，就是分圈管理和分槽喂养。圈舍干燥，清洁，阳光充足，空气流通。按公母、肉猪、大猪、小猪、好猪、病猪分圈管理。喂食也按以上分法分槽分等喂养。每次喂完以后，如发现有猪嘴慢没吃好，就留下来吃偏饭。喂猪时间要固定，喂多少也要定量，使猪生活规律化。不能过迟、过早或过饥、过饱。猪食要不冷不热，一般是冬不可太热，夏不可太冷。往槽里添食时，要先稀后稠，先少后多，逐步增加。这样猪吃的多，消化正常，不拉稀，不吐食，不闹病。此外，他们还每天赶猪出圈散散风，夜里撵动一两次，让猪增加活动量。
    对于猪病，他们采取了“七分防、三分治”的办法，把重点放在防疫上。万一发生了疾病，就采取有效的措施，把病消灭在初期。就是已经连续六年无病猪，他们也从来没放松防疫保健工作。
    白家沟上上下下组成了一个严密的防疫网。管理区设了一个兽医站，专门有一个猪医生和两个助手，药品、器械样样俱全，时刻保持战斗状态。各个生产队和猪场，都设有防疫员，随时进行防疫检查，一旦发生疫病，能治的就治，不能治的就赶紧请猪医生。
    多年的经验告诉他们，饲养员和防疫员紧密结合是一个好办法。他们共同研究摸索，找出了有效的防治猪病发生的办法。这就是夏季除打防疫针以外，最好给猪吃一次羊腥，就能防治猪瘟。立秋至寒露再打一次防疫针，就可以预防丹毒。每天放风，春夏秋放牧，夏季勤洗澡，都对猪的育肥保健有益。
    为了防止外来疫病的传染，凡外来猪入境、过境，都必须经过严格的健康检查。并主动的给毗邻的兄弟公社和区、队进行防疫治疗。
    白家沟去年已办起了红专学校，优秀饲养员贾三孟和猪医生贾碰牛都被聘为养猪教员，定期讲授养猪技术。全白家沟的人也都是猪迷，三孟和碰牛差不多每天都要接待几个蹬门“取经”的人。因此，他们的每一种新经验，用不了三、五天就传遍了全管理区，家家户户都有一两个养猪的能手。
