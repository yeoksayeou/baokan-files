Xinhua News Agency Report: The Songhua River Prefecture in Heilongjiang Province, a major soybean producing area, saw its total soybean output increase by 35% this year on six million mu of soybean cultivation.

　　Since last winter, various counties in the Songhua River area have launched publicity and debates among cadres and the masses to strive for high soybean yields, criticized the "emphasize grain, neglect soybeans" mentality of a small number of people, and organized the masses to summarize experiences in achieving high soybean yields, using examples of high yields to refute the erroneous ideas that "soybean production has reached its peak" and "soybeans cannot achieve high yields."

　　In the process of soybean production, the entire district has given full play to the superiority of the people's communes. Based on different conditions such as soil quality, water conservancy, and crop rotation, the communes adjusted land plots and engaged in large-scale deep plowing. Sixty percent of the soybean land in the entire district has been deep plowed, which has played a significant role in this year's bumper soybean harvest.

    松花江专区大豆增产三成半
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省大豆主要产地松花江专区今年种植的六百万亩大豆，总产量比去年增产三成半。
    松花江地区各县从去年冬季开始，就在干部和群众中开展了力争大豆丰产的宣传和辩论，批判了少数人存在的“重粮轻豆”思想，并组织群众总结大豆的丰产经验，用丰产实例驳倒了“大豆增产到顶”和“大豆不能高产”的错误思想。
    全区在大豆生产过程中充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，各公社根据土质、水利、茬口等不同条件，调整了地块，并大搞深翻地。全区有百分之六十的大豆地都深翻过，对今年大豆丰收起了很大作用。
