　　Seizing Land from the Sea
　　——Visiting the "Dawn" Military Reclamation Farm
　　By Our Correspondent Wei Zhen
    The jeep we were riding in sped across what was once the sea in the tenth century. One morning a few days ago, the Ninh Binh Provincial Party Committee sent a comrade to accompany us by car to visit a new alluvial land at the estuary of the Red River Delta. According to Vietnamese historical records, Ninh Binh City, the capital of Ninh Binh Province, was on the coast in the tenth century. This means that the nearly 50-kilometer journey we took from Ninh Binh City to the coast, including the entire Kim Son County and Phat Diem town, where North Vietnamese Catholics congregate, was a vast ocean in the tenth century.
    A Vietnamese comrade familiar with the area told us that the land of the Red River Delta is continuing to extend into the sea along the approximately 150-kilometer coastline at an average rate of 50 meters per year. This means that the Red River, which is 1,050 kilometers long and brings silt from Yunnan Province in China and the northwestern mountainous areas of Vietnam, creates an average of about 750 hectares of alluvial land for northern Vietnam every year.
    Generally speaking, the land is extending towards the sea, but sometimes fierce sea waves can wipe out large areas of alluvial land in an instant. For example, a storm in 1937 brought sea waves that swept away several thousand hectares of alluvial land in the Red River Delta in three hours. In Hai Hau County, Nam Dinh Province alone, more than 1,000 hectares of fertile land were washed away, and even a seawall built during the French colonial period was swept away without a trace. When this reporter visited the coast of Hai Hau County last year, I still saw the ruins of the sluice gates of the seawall at that time.
    Hundreds of years ago, the Vietnamese people understood how to seize land from the sea. They built seawalls to protect the newly formed fertile land and to live and multiply on this land. More than ten kilometers southeast of Ninh Binh City, one can still see a seawall built more than 300 years ago during the Le Dynasty, called the "Hong Duc" dike. It tells us that the land here has extended more than 30 kilometers towards the sea in the past 300 years.
    "The speed of extension is indeed astonishing," said the Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department of Ninh Binh Province to this reporter. He said: "Since the restoration of peace, the six-kilometer-wide section of Ninh Binh Province facing the sea (according to the Ninh Binh Province's sea-facing section being only six kilometers wide in total) has been extending into the sea at a rate of 100 to 300 meters per year." The sea here in Ninh Binh Province is relatively shallow, so the silt accumulates particularly quickly. A seawall that was just completed before the August Revolution of 1945 is now two or three kilometers away from the sea.
    When we arrived at the coast of Ninh Binh Province, a new dike, just completed in July of this year, appeared before us. It is two kilometers away from the aforementioned seawall built in 1945. The new dike encloses more than 900 hectares of alluvial land, which is the "Dawn" Military Reclamation Farm we are going to visit. There, the autumn rice had just been harvested, and it is said that the average yield per hectare is more than three tons, and the yield of several experimental fields reached five to seven tons. The newly planted large areas of sedge have emerged from the water, African crucian carp are jumping in the newly dug ponds, and flocks of ducks, arranged for dozens of feet long, swim between the rice fields, sedge and sea reeds (seawater reeds). The newly built farm dormitories look like a neat town. Soldiers and young male and female farmers participating in the farm work are working hard near the dormitory area, digging soil and filling stones, and they are building sports fields for themselves. Countless emerald green coconut seedlings have been planted beside the houses, along the dikes, and on the ridges between the crisscrossing fields, and they will soon grow into windbreak coconut groves along this coast.
    Comrade Wu Wenbing, the director of the military reclamation farm, and Comrade Nguyen Qiu, the deputy director, warmly received us at the farm office. The office walls are hung with portraits of President Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Mao Zedong, and many slogans written in both Vietnamese and Chinese: "Long live President Ho Chi Minh," "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong," "Long live Vietnamese-Chinese friendship," "Learn from the spirit of the Chinese people who struggled hard for three years for ten thousand years of happiness"... These slogans were all written by Director Wu himself. Director Wu was an old soldier of the Soviet revolution in Yi'an thirty years ago and the political commissar of a regiment of the People's Army during the War of Resistance. Comrade Huang Xie, the Vietnamese translator who accompanied us on the visit, was his old subordinate, and they were particularly cordial when they met.
    Then, the director introduced us to the People's Army's struggle with the sea to build the "Dawn" farm.
    Indeed, the Red River brings a large amount of new fertile soil to the delta every year, but if strong dams are not built, these lands cannot be used in time under the threat of sea waves. As soon as peace was restored in Vietnam, the Ninh Binh Provincial Government began preparing for the construction of the dikes. In order to protect the future new seawall, in 1954, the Ninh Binh Provincial Government planted 530,000 square meters of underwater forest outside the dike site where the dike was to be built. The underwater forest is growing well and is currently one to three meters high. On February 15th of this year, construction of the new dike began. A unit of the People's Army accepted the task of building the dike and establishing the "Dawn" Military Reclamation Farm here. This unit is one of the many People's Army units marching towards the production front. The northeast side of the "Dawn" farm is the Day River, a branch of the Red River flowing into the sea. The silt accumulated on the "Dawn" farm is mainly brought by the Day River. On the other side of the Day River is Hai Hau County in Nam Dinh Province, where another People's Army unit has taken on the task of seizing 1,000 hectares of land from the sea and has established a military reclamation farm called "Dawn" at the same time as the "Dawn" farm.
    The builders of the "Dawn" farm had to build the nearly eleven-kilometer-long dike before the rainy season, leaving them only half a year. Before 1936, the French spent eleven years building a seawall of similar scale to this new dike, called the "Yunhai" seawall; before 1945, a priest named Le Huu Tu mobilized farmers to build a seven-kilometer-long small dike for him southeast of the "Yunhai" dike, which also took three years.
    With the support of the local people, the battle to build the new dike began. Compared with the sandy "Dawn" farm, the dike construction work here has more favorable conditions, as most of the alluvial soil here is clay. However, the difficulty is that most of the dike site is still submerged by seawater at high tide, so the initial dike construction had to be carried out at low tide. As a result, many precious daytime hours were wasted in vain. The People's Army soldiers discovered in practice that dry clay is not easily dissolved in seawater, the seawater is very shallow, and it is protected by the underwater forest outside, and the tidal pull is not strong. Therefore, pouring dry clay during high tide during the day can speed up the construction of the dike. In particular, the tide can also be used to transport soil by boat during high tide, which greatly saves manpower for transporting soil.
    Some local reactionary priests spread rumors that the new dike would definitely not be built. However, the People's Army, in the spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, resolutely used its own created indigenous methods to build the dike. After 820,000 working days of effort, they dug and filled 480,000 cubic meters of earth and 13,200 cubic meters of stone. On July 15th of this year, the seawall was basically completed, more than a month ahead of the original plan. A water gate was also built on the east side to drain water, which was built by a part of the People's Army in more than sixty days and nights of hard work. In this way, the ghost story spread by the reactionary priests that "the seawall will definitely not be built" was shattered. Not only do the Catholic people along the coast admire the People's Army's fearless spirit of seizing land from the sea, but they are also very grateful to the People's Army for building a strong new dike, protecting the original old dike, and protecting the safety of their lives and property. Previously, neither the "Le Huu Tu" dike nor the "Yunhai" dike could do this. In the past, these two old dikes often collapsed under the impact of sea waves. The new dike is very strong, with a base width of 19 to 22 meters, a height of 4 meters above the sea, and a dike surface width of 3 meters, which can be used for cars. The dike is also protected by stones on the outside.
    We climbed onto the new dike and looked out to sea. At that time, it was low tide, and the seawater was one kilometer away from the dike. Before us were large areas of lush underwater forest and sea reeds, and further out were 230 hectares of newly planted sedge, which stretched all the way to the sea. Sedge is a valuable economic crop, and each hectare here can produce ten tons, and each ton is currently equal to the price of three tons of dry grain. The beautiful and durable bed mats, floor mats, and tote baskets, and other sedge products produced in Ninh Binh Province are sold far and wide to socialist countries and are still in short supply.
    Director Wu said that the preliminary development plan for the "Dawn" farm is to plant 250 to 300 hectares of rice, 200 to 250 hectares of sedge, 100 hectares of castor, and 100 hectares of pasture for raising livestock. The farm will continue to dig many ponds to raise various fish. Next year, it will raise 10,000 ducks, and soon it will develop to 30,000. The farm will run its own sedge processing factory, a paper mill using sedge heads and tails as raw materials, a dye factory using underwater forest as raw materials, and a fish sauce factory, etc. There are many fish in the nearby sea, and a fishing team is being prepared.
    He said that the more than 1,000 hectares of shallow sea outside the dike that will soon silt up into land will soon be planted with sedge. In this way, on the one hand, a large amount of raw materials can be provided for Ninh Binh Province's weaving industry. At the same time, the sand and soil can accumulate faster after planting sedge. Currently, preparations are actively being made to plant a new underwater forest three kilometers away. It is expected that by 1966, these more than 1,000 hectares of land can be silted up to the sea level (i.e., the midline between high tide and low tide). At that time, the construction of the new seawall will begin again.
    Director Wu pointed to several islands in the distance and said, "Please come and see again then, maybe those few islands will become hills on the land!" (Attached picture)

　　与海争地
　　——访问“黎明”军垦农场
　　本报记者　韦真
    我们乘坐的吉普车奔驰在十世纪时曾是海洋的地方。几天以前的一个上午，宁平省省委派一位同志，陪同我们乘车到红河三角洲南部海口参观一块新的冲积地。根据越南历史记载，十世纪时宁平省省会宁平市是在海边，这就是说，我们所走过的从宁平市到海边的近五十公里路程，包括北越天主教徒聚居的整个金山县和发艳镇，在十世纪时还是一片汪洋大海。
    熟悉这一带情况的越南同志告诉我们说，红河三角洲的陆地，正在沿着约一百五十公里的海岸线，平均以每年五十米的速度继续不断地向海延伸着。这就是说，全长一千零五十公里的红河，从我国的云南省和越南西北山区带来的泥沙，每年平均为越南北方缔造了约七百五十公顷冲积地。
    总的说来，土地是在向海伸展的，但是，有时候凶猛的海涛也会在刹那之间刷掉大片冲积地。例如1937年一次大风暴带来的海涛，曾经在三小时内卷走了红河三角洲几千公顷冲积地，仅南定省海后县，就被冲走了一千多公顷沃土，连法国统治时期建造的一道海堤也被刷得无影无踪。记者去年到海后县海滨参观时，还看到当时海堤水闸的废墟。
    几百年以前，越南人民就懂得与海争地，他们建起一道道的海堤，把新生的肥沃土地保护起来，在这土地上繁衍生息。在宁平市东南十多公里的地方，现在还可以看到一道三百多年前黎朝时代修筑的海堤，名叫“鸿德”堤。它告诉我们，三百年来，这里的土地已经向海伸展了三十多公里。
    “伸展速度的确是惊人的。”宁平省水利司副司长对记者说。他说：“和平恢复以来，宁平省出海的六公里宽的地段上（按宁平省出海地段一共只有六公里宽），每年向海伸展达一百至三百米。”宁平省这里的海比较浅，所以淤积得特别快。1945年八月革命前刚建成的一道海堤，目前已经离海二、三公里了。
    我们来到宁平省海边之时，一道今年7月才建成的新堤出现在眼前。它离前述1945年建成的海堤有两公里远。新堤共围起了九百多公顷冲积地，这就是我们要参观的“黎明”军垦农场。在那里，秋稻刚收割完毕，据说一般每公顷产量在三吨以上，几块试验田的产量达五吨到七吨。新种的大片席草已经露出水面，非洲鲫鱼跳跃在新挖的池塘里，排列达几十丈长的鸭群穿游在稻田、席草和海苇（海水芦苇）之间。新建的农场宿舍像一座整齐的市镇。部队指战员和参加农场工作的男女青年农民正在宿舍区附近紧张地挖土填石，他们在为自己修筑体育运动场。在屋旁、堤边和纵横田间的田埂边上，已经种上了无数翠绿的椰树苗，它们不久之后将成长为这一带海滨的防风椰林。
    军垦农场场长武文丙同志和副场长阮秋同志在农场办公所热情地接见了我们。办公所墙壁上挂有胡主席像和毛主席像，还贴着许多用越中两国文字写成的标语：“胡主席万岁”、“毛主席万岁”、“越中友谊万岁”、“学习中国人民苦战三年、幸福万代的精神”……。这些标语都是武场长亲手写的。武场长是三十年前宜安苏维埃革命的老战士、抗战时期人民军的团政委。陪同我们去访问的越南翻译黄协同志是他的老部下，见面之下格外亲热。
    接着，场长向我们介绍了人民军与海争地、建成“黎明”农场的一些情况。
    的确，红河每年为三角洲带来大量新的沃土，可是如果不筑起坚固的堤坝，在海涛威胁之下，这些土地是不能及时加以使用的。越南和平刚恢复，宁平省政府就开始为筑堤做了准备工作。为了使将来的新海堤得到保护，1954年，宁平省政府就在准备筑堤的堤址外，种上了五十三万平方米的海底森林。海底森林的生长情况良好，目前已有一米至三米高。今年2月15日，新堤开始动工兴建了。人民军某部接受了建堤和在这里成立“黎明”军垦农场的任务。这支部队是正在向生产战线进军的许许多多人民军部队单位之一。“黎明”农场的东北面是红河出海支流底河，“黎明”农场淤积的泥土主要就是从底河带来的。底河对岸是南定省的海后县，那里另一支人民军部队担负起了与海争夺一千公顷土地的任务，已经同“黎明”农场同时建立起一个名叫“曙光”的军垦农场。
    “黎明”农场的建造者必须在雨季之前把近十一公里的长堤筑好，留给他们的只有半年时间。而在1936年以前，法国人为了修筑一道规模同这新堤差不多的名叫“云海”的海堤，共花了十一年时间；1945年以前，一位名叫黎友词的神父动员农民在“云海”堤东南边为他修筑一道七公里长的小堤，也花了三年时间。
    在当地人民支援下，建筑新堤的奋战开始了。同多沙的“曙光”农场比较，这里的筑堤工作有着较有利的条件，这里的冲积土绝大部分是粘土。但困难是大部分堤址在涨潮时还受海水淹没，所以最初筑堤时必须在退潮时进行填土。这样一来，许多宝贵的白天时间被白白地浪费掉了。人民军战士在实践中发现，干的粘土泡在海水里并不容易化开，海水又很浅，而且有外边的海底森林保护着，潮水拉力不强，所以，在白天涨潮的时候倒干粘土，是可以加快筑堤速度的，特别是涨潮时还可以利用潮水，用船载土，大大节省运土的人力。
    当地个别反动神父曾散播流言，说新堤一定建不成。但是人民军本着不怕困难的精神，坚决用自己创造的土法筑堤，经过八十二万个劳动日的努力，挖填了四十八万土方、一万三千二百石方，今年7月15日，海堤基本建成，比原订计划提前一个多月。东边还修好一个水阐用来排水，它是一部分人民军奋战六十多昼夜建成的。这样，反动神父散播的“海堤一定修不成”的鬼话被粉碎了。沿海天主教教民们不但敬佩人民军与海争地的大无畏精神，而且非常感谢人民军修起坚固的新堤，保护了原有的旧堤，保护了他们的生命财产的安全。在这以前，不管是“黎友词”堤或“云海”堤，都做不到这一点。过去在海涛冲击下，这两个旧堤经常溃决。新堤非常坚固，底宽十九米至二十二米，高出海面四米，堤面宽三米，可以走汽车。堤外还护有石块。
    我们登上新堤向海了望，当时是退潮时候，海水离堤有一公里远，眼前是大片苍郁的海底森林和海苇，再往外是一直蔓延到海面的二百三十公顷新种的席草。席草是贵重的经济作物，这里每公顷能产十吨，每吨目前等于三吨干谷的价钱。宁平省出产的美观耐用的床席、地席和提篮等席草制品，远销社会主义各国，目前还供不应求。
    武场长说，“黎明”农场的初步发展计划是种稻谷二百五十至三百公顷，种席草二百至二百五十公顷，蓖麻一百公顷，养牲口的牧草一百公顷。农场将继续挖许多池塘来养各种鱼。明年要养一万只鸭，不久之后要发展到三万只。农场要自办席草加工厂，用席草头尾做原料的造纸厂，用海底森林做原料的染料厂和鱼露厂等。附近海面鱼很多，准备成立一支捕鱼队。
    他说，堤外的一千多公顷即将淤成陆地的浅海，不久之后将全部种上席草，这样，一方面可以为宁平省的织席业提供大量原料，同时，种席草后沙土可以淤积得更快。目前已积极准备在三公里外种上新的海底森林，预计到1966年，这一千多公顷土地就可以淤出海平线（即涨潮和退潮之间的中间线），到那时候，新的海堤又要动工兴建。
    武场长指着远处的几个海岛说：“那时候请你们再来看看吧，也许那几个海岛就要成为陆地的山丘了！”（附图片）
