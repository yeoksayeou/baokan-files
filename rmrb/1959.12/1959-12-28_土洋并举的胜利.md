　　The Victory of Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods
　　Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Party Committee of the Hanjiang Danjiangkou Construction Site

　　The ancient three-thousand-li Han River was cut off by the ten-thousand-strong construction army on December 26th this year. From that day on, the untamed Han River began to be controlled by the people. The Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub Project for harnessing the Han River has entered a new stage. The people's Han River has entered a new era. The Hanjiang Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub Project officially started construction on September 1st last year. Before and after the start of construction, a fierce struggle between two roads and two ideologies unfolded. The focus of the struggle was specifically manifested in two questions: whether the Danjiangkou project could start construction at that time and whether indigenous methods could be adopted for construction under conditions of insufficient mechanical equipment. This was a matter of principle. Its essence was: should we harness the Han River now, or in the future? Should we develop the Han River in a faster, better, and more economical way by following the Party's General Line, or should we develop the Han River steadily and slowly? This was a struggle between advanced and backward thinking, a struggle between supporting and not supporting the General Line. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee put forward the construction policy of "giving prominence to politics, strengthening leadership, relying on the masses, self-reliance, focusing on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign methods" for the Hanjiang Danjiangkou project. The construction site Party committee resolutely implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and adopted indigenous methods to start construction on September 1st last year. Today, the victory of the Han River cutoff has concluded this struggle: it is invincible to conscientiously implement the Party's General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies to realize the General Line, and to advance along the path instructed by our Party and the people's great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. The victory of the Hanjiang Danjiangkou project construction is a victory for the Party's General Line, a victory for the People's Commune, and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

　　Whether a project can start construction depends on how well the preparatory work is done. For such a large river harnessing project as the Han River, even more thorough preparations should be made. This is a common understanding. However, some people one-sidedly understand the so-called "well-prepared" as necessarily possessing sufficient machinery, complete power, and modern transportation conditions. Only with these conditions can construction begin. Without these conditions, construction cannot begin. The Hanjiang Danjiangkou construction site did not fully possess these conditions at the time, and therefore construction could not begin. The Hanjiang Danjiangkou construction site Party committee had a different view from these comrades: preparation includes two aspects, one is ideological preparation, and the other is material preparation, but the key lies in ideological preparation. When the people have made sufficient ideological preparations and act actively, they can overcome various difficulties and accelerate the completion of material preparation. Harnessing the Han River is the urgent desire of the people for thousands of years, and the ideological foundation is very solid. To strengthen the Party's leadership, fully mobilize the masses, and have the conviction of "we must win if we fight, and we must succeed if we work," there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. The mistake of these comrades lies in the fact that they considered thousands of things, but neglected one: that people are the most active and decisive factor in the development of production. They cannot see that after people grasp the laws of objective things, they can exert subjective initiative and promote the high-speed development of things. They cannot see the leadership of the Party, cannot see the power of the communized people, and only sit in the office pulling slide rules and writing plans, calculating and calculating, and come to a wrong conclusion: this cannot be done, that is impossible.

　　The construction of a project must have a suitable construction plan. For such a large river harnessing project as the Han River, there should be an even more suitable construction plan for the current specific conditions. This is also a common understanding. However, some people limit the construction of giant water conservancy projects to only using "foreign" methods such as steel sheet piles and wooden sheet piles; when the conditions for implementing these methods are not available, they cannot move forward. They completely ignore the experience of the people of the motherland in fighting floods for thousands of years, and violate the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" to realize the General Line. Contrary to these comrades, the Hanjiang Danjiangkou construction site Party committee, holding high the red flag of the General Line, adopted the experience of flood diversion in Jingjiang, flood diversion in Hanjiang, vehicle turning and damming of the Jingjiang dike, and damming of the Xintankou, summarized by the masses, to use earth to drive water and a combination of earth, sand, and stone to build the first-stage cofferdam on the right bank of the project. The construction site Party committee handed this plan over to the masses for discussion, and the masses' conclusion was: this way of using earth to drive water turns underwater construction into land construction, ensuring safety; the technology is simple, the masses can easily understand it, and it can ensure that the project is constructed at the fastest speed and with the best quality. This way of implementing the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign methods" greatly saved time and speed for harnessing the Han River. Despite this, some comrades still harbored endless worries, worrying about whether the phenomenon of cofferdam collapse would occur when building an earth cofferdam on such a large Han River? Can people race against floods? However, the construction site Party committee has always followed the working method of the mass line taught by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, insisting on taking rectification as the key, taking politics as the soul, and launching a large-scale mass movement; when there are difficulties, consult the masses. As soon as the ten-thousand-strong army gathered at the construction site, the Party committee put forward: Does the Han River need to be harnessed? For whom is it harnessed? Who will harness it? How to harness it? Launching a heated debate among the masses. Through big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, and big debates, the enthusiasm of the ten-thousand-strong army was aroused. They enthusiastically sang the praises of big-character posters: "Big-character posters, like the sun, shining brightly in red and green, illuminating the spirits of the soldiers, promoting the red flag to flutter in the wind." The construction site Party committee, based on the demands of the masses, put forward the call of "caring about the quality of the project more than caring about one's own eyeballs," and workers and farmers said from their own experience: "Eyeballs are a personal matter, the quality of the project is a matter for the people of Hubei and Henan provinces, and even for the people of the whole country." At the Danjiangkou construction site, red flags of speed first, quality first, and thrift first were flying everywhere in the wind; everywhere you could hear the masses singing the praises of long live high speed, long live the mass movement, long live big-character posters! Workers and farmers completed more than 600,000 cubic meters of earthwork and stonework in more than a month, built the first-stage cofferdam project on the right bank, which was more than 1,200 meters long, and overcame the peach flood, which occurs once in a hundred years on the Han River! In one year and four months, they completed 9.2 million cubic meters of earthwork and stonework and 410,000 cubic meters of concrete, experienced the test of the summer flood season, and cut off the Han River! Facts have proved that starting with indigenous methods has achieved a great victory in the construction of the Danjiangkou water conservancy project. In the face of this victory, the superstition that large-scale water conservancy construction projects cannot use indigenous methods is self-defeating. The ten-thousand construction workers at the Danjiangkou construction site, together with the people of the whole country, cheered the victory of the Party's General Line. This is a victory achieved under the care of the Party Central Committee and the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and with the enthusiastic support of the people from all over the country. Now, this project, which started with indigenous methods, is rapidly moving towards semi-mechanized and mechanized construction. Last September, there was only 30 kW of power generation equipment here, and only more than 320 workers; now there are 13,000 kW of power, more than 2,000 sets of machinery, and a 10,000-strong people's hydraulic engineering team with a certain political literacy, cultural level, and technical ability. The Danjiangkou construction site is not only a water conservancy construction base, but also the best mass water conservancy "university." The ten-thousand construction workers are building reservoirs here, tempering their thinking, and studying culture. Many of them have transformed from ordinary workers and farmers into vanguards in socialist construction. People have already fallen in love with this place they built and are proud of the title of "Danjiangkou people." They say: Seeing the construction of the Danjiangkou construction site, the more you see it, the happier you become, and the more you see it, the more motivated you become!

　　In the course of more than a year of construction, the Hanjiang Danjiangkou construction site, relying on the strength of the masses, overcame one difficulty after another, and achieved one victory after another. On the road of victorious advance, the construction site Party committee always remembered Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching: "Modesty helps one to progress, pride makes one lag behind." Constantly using this idea to educate all employees. The Hanjiang Danjiangkou construction site has no experience, if there is, it is: under the glorious light of the Party's General Line, in leadership, adhere to giving prominence to politics and launching a large-scale mass movement; in method, emphasize both indigenous and foreign construction methods.

　　The Han River has been cut off by the people. This is only the beginning of victory, and even more arduous tasks are ahead. The construction site Party committee is leading all employees, with revolutionary heroic spirit, to advance victoriously.

　　土洋并举的胜利
    中共湖北省委书记兼汉江丹江口工地党委书记　张体学
    古老的三千里汉江，在今年12月26日，被参加建设的十万大军斩断了。从这一天起，不驯的汉江就开始控制在人民的手里。根治汉江的丹江口水利枢纽工程跨上了一个新的阶段。人民的汉江进入了一个新的时代。汉江丹江口水利枢纽工程，是在去年9月1日正式开工的。开工前后就展开了两条道路和两种思想的激烈斗争。斗争的焦点，具体表现在丹江口工程能不能在当时开工和能不能在机械设备不足的条件下采用土法开工两个问题上。这是个原则性的争论。它的实质是我们在现时就根治汉江呢？还是在将来根治汉江？是遵循着党的总路线多快好省地开发汉江呢？还是四平八稳，慢慢吞吞地开发汉江？这是先进思想与落后思想的斗争，是拥护总路线和不拥护总路线的斗争。湖北省委给汉江丹江口工程提出了“政治挂帅，加强领导，依靠群众，自力更生，以土为主，土洋并举，先土后洋”的建设方针。工地党委坚决执行了党中央和湖北省委的指示，采用土法在去年9月1日开工了。今天，汉江截流的胜利就为这个斗争作出了结论：认真执行党的总路线和实现总路线的一套完整的两条腿走路的方针，按照我们的党和人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志指示的道路前进，是无往不胜的。汉江丹江口工程建设的胜利，是党的总路线的胜利，是人民公社的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利！
    一个工程能否开工取决于准备工作做得如何。根治汉江这样大的河流更应当做好充分的准备。这是共同的认识。但是，有些人却把所谓准备好片面地理解为必须具备充分的机械，完整的动力和现代化的交通条件。有了这些条件方能开工。没有这些条件就不能开工。汉江丹江口工地当时并不完全具备这些条件，也就不能开工。汉江丹江口工地党委和这些同志不同的看法是：准备包括两个方面，一是思想准备，一是物质准备，而关键在于思想准备。当人民群众有了充分的思想准备而积极行动起来，就能克服各种困难，加速完成物资的准备。根治汉江是人民群众几千年来的迫切愿望，思想基础是十分巩固的。要加强党的领导，充分发动群众，具有战必胜、干必成的信念，就没有什么克服不了的困难。这些同志的错误就在于他们考虑了千条百条，却忽略了一条：人才是生产发展中的最活跃的决定性的因素。他们看不见人在掌握客观事物的规律以后，就能发挥主观能动作用，促进事物的高速度发展。他们看不见党的领导，看不见公社化了的人民群众的力量，光是坐在办公室里拉计算尺、写方案，算来算去，就得出了个错误的结论：这办不到，那不可能。　　建设一个工程必须有适合的施工方案。根治汉江这样大的河流更应当有适合当前具体条件的施工方案。这也是共同的认识。有些人却把建设巨型水利工程局限在只能用钢板桩、木板桩等“洋”办法上；当实行这些办法的条件不具备时，就寸步难行。他们完全忽视了祖国人民千百年来与洪水作斗争的经验，违背了党实现总路线的两条腿走路的方针。与这些同志相反，汉江丹江口工地党委高举着总路线的红旗，根据群众总结的荆江分洪、汉江分洪、荆江大堤车弯堵口、新滩口堵口的治水经验采用了以土赶水、土砂石组合围堵来修筑工程右岸的第一期围堰。工地党委将这个方案交给群众讨论，群众的结论是：这样以土赶水，将水下工程变成了陆地施工，保证了安全；技术简单，群众易懂，可以保证工程以最快的速度和最好的质量施工。这样实行“土洋并举、先土后洋”的方针，就为根治汉水大大地赢得了时间和速度。尽管这样，也还有些同志怀着无穷的忧虑，耽心在这样大的汉江上建土围堰，会不会出现围堰崩塌的现象？人能否和洪水赛跑？但是工地党委始终遵循着党中央和毛泽东同志教导的群众路线的工作方法，坚持以整风为纲，以政治为灵魂，大搞群众运动；有困难便向群众请教。十万大军刚齐集工地，党委就提出了：汉水要不要治？为谁治？谁来治？怎样治？在群众中展开热烈的辩论。通过大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，十万大军的干劲起来了，他们是这样热情地歌颂大字报：“大字报，像太阳，红红绿绿放光芒，照得战士精神爽，促进红旗随风飘。”工地党委又根据群众的要求提出了“关心工程质量，要胜过关心自己的眼珠”的号召，工人和农民们都以他们自己的体会说：“眼珠是个人的问题，工程质量是湖北、河南两省人民的问题，甚至是全国人民的问题。”在丹江口工地上，到处都是速度第一、质量第一、勤俭第一的红旗在迎风招展；到处都可以听到群众在歌颂高速度万岁，群众运动万岁，大字报万岁！工人和农民们，以一个多月的时间完成了六十多万土石方，筑起了长达一千二百多米的右岸第一期围堰工程，战胜了汉江上百年一遇的桃汛！在一年零四个月里完成了九百二十万土石方和四十一万方混凝土，经历了暑期大汛的考验，又斩断了汉江！事实证明，土法上马已经在丹江口水利工程建设中取得了伟大的胜利。在这个胜利的面前，大型水利建筑工程不能用土办法的迷信是不攻自破了。丹江口工地的十万建设者和全国人民一起欢呼党的总路线的胜利。这是在党中央和湖北省委关怀下，在全国各地人民的热情支援下取得的胜利。现在，这个以土法上马的工程正在迅速地向半机械化和机械化施工的道路迈进。去年9月，这里只有三十瓩的发电设备，只有三百二十多名工人；现在有了一万三千瓩电源、两千多台机具，有一支万人的有一定政治素养、文化水平、技术能力的人民水工队伍。丹江口工地不仅是一个水利建设基地，而且是一所最好的群众性的水利“大学”。十万建设者在这里修建水库，锻炼思想，学习文化。他们当中的许多人，已经由一个普通的工人和农民，变成了社会主义建设中的尖兵。人们已经热爱上了自己建设的这个地方，以“丹江口人”的称号自豪。他们说：看到丹江口工地的建设，真是越看越高兴，越看越有劲！
    在一年多的施工过程中，汉江丹江口工地依靠群众的力量，战胜了一个又一个的困难，取得了一次又一次的胜利。在胜利前进的道路上，工地党委时刻记取着毛泽东同志的教诲：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”不断地以这种思想教导全体职工。汉江丹江口工地是没有什么经验的，如果有，那就是：在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在领导上坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动；方法上强调土法施工、洋法施工并举。
    汉江被人民斩断了。这只是胜利的开端，更加艰巨的任务还在后头。工地党委正领导全体职工，以革命的英雄气概，乘胜前进。
