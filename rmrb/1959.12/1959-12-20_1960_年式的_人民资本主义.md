1960s-Style “People's Capitalism”
American Economist Viktor Perlo

On November 7th, the anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, I picked up a newspaper with a speech by Thomas S. Repplier, Chairman of the Advertising Council.

In that speech, he claimed that the Communists had distorted “the American system.” He said that American propagandists should counter the Communists' attacks with capitalist ideas that signify "socialist benevolence."

He went on to say: "We should present ourselves as the true protectors of the common man, as the true revolutionaries, the kind who ride on the great waves that propel us into the future, as progressive and vibrant leaders, not a moribund society." Repplier wanted his audience to recognize a "self-evident fact, that a new capitalism has emerged. Under this capitalism, working people have become captains of capital”...

I turned on the radio, wanting to hear the newly emerged American “worker-capitalist captains” parade to celebrate Mr. Repplier's so-called new "revolution." But the first announcement by the broadcaster was: "Today, the U.S. Supreme Court approved the use of the Taft-Hartley Act against the striking steelworkers. Now, half a million steelworkers must return to work."

Oh! The gentlemen in power on the U.S. Supreme Court don't know that American workers have become "captains of capital." The judges are even more vigorously protecting the old methods of wage slavery and oppression, supporting the rule of private ownership and the regime of private owners.

The steel tycoons beamed with delight. The stock prices of their companies soared on Wall Street. With the government's blatant use of orders to support them, the companies have been able to force workers to speed up labor, completely ignoring safety, and reducing the number of workers employed in the steel industry by one-third compared to 1946.

Five years ago, capitalist theorists were vying to create new names for their system to beautify it. Repplier outdid everyone. He created the name "People's Capitalism." Now, due to the rapid progress of socialist societies, the scientific achievements of the Soviet Union, and the recent outbreak of the most severe post-war economic crisis in the United States, he and others who promoted the idea of "People's Capitalism" are having an unlucky time.

In the United States, the propaganda of "People's Capitalism" has deceived a considerable portion of the middle class, white-collar workers, and some of the better-paid manual laborers. Not long ago, some labor unions exposed capitalist fantasies. However, some workers, who were deeply influenced by reactionary propaganda, still held this erroneous idea.

Now, the defenders of capitalism have begun a new phase of propaganda. While using old methods, they are more frequently comparing the socialist system with the capitalist system, because the Soviet Union's call for economic competition is becoming increasingly realistic.

Thus, Repplier's crude propaganda is very much like a circus barker forcibly soliciting customers.

Among the propagandists of "People's Capitalism" is Columbia University law professor Adolf A. Berle. However, he is not a scholar locked in an ivory tower, but a well-known politician, as well as a legal advisor to large companies and chairman of the "American Molasses Company." Although Berle is not a financial magnate, he is registered on the New York Stock Exchange as the owner of an enterprise with annual revenue of sixty million dollars.

Berle's previous works were mostly a mixture of concrete research and absurd theories. However, his recent books are naked propaganda devoid of any sign of serious research.

In his book "The 20th Century Capitalist Revolution," published several years ago, Berle tried hard to prove that large American corporations have a "soul" and, like medieval kings, show paternal care for their subordinates. He recently published a book called "Power Without Property." The basic content was introduced by the author in an article in "The New York Times." The title of that article was: "Marx Was Wrong and So Is Khrushchev"...

The following are his stale arguments for boasting about the 1960s-style American "People's Capitalism."

Berle asserts that it is not the giants of the securities market who lead large American corporations now, but professional managers, who are merely a special kind of "public office." He says: These managers possess “authority but without property.”

Indeed, with a stroke of Berle's pen, American industry has been "socialized."

What is the truth?

Families with billions in income continue to control American enterprises. Managers and senior executives of enterprises, if they are not members of large families themselves, are basically from the upper circles of the bourgeoisie.

Berle himself admits in his so-called "exceptions": Ford controls "Ford Motor Company," DuPont controls "DuPont Company," Mellon controls "Aluminum Company of America," and the Hartford family controls "The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company." These are all large companies in the fields of chemicals, aluminum manufacturing, the automobile industry, and retail trade. The largest automobile company, "General Motors," is controlled by DuPont.

There is no doubt that Rockefeller controls "Mobil Oil Company," just as Ford controls the company named after his family. I don't understand why Berle did not include "Mobil Oil Company" in his list of "exceptions."

However, this is also understandable. Berle has admitted in his new book that he was hired by Nelson Rockefeller to study the statistics of self-operated companies. In addition, Rockefeller's "Chase Manhattan Bank" is also providing funds for the "American Molasses Company"...

Berle believes that since the number of American stock holders has reached twelve and a half million, and another fifty million people "do not even know that they indirectly receive income from stocks through insurance and subsidies..." many Americans directly control American companies.

In an article I wrote last year, I pointed out that the 50,000 large families who hold stock in America concentrate two-thirds of the nation's stocks. At the same time, half of the stockholders—small holders—together only control 1% of the stock. This stock is completely insufficient to significantly increase their income.

Americans who rely on wage income only hold three-thousandths of the total share capital, but the three largest billionaire families: DuPont, Mellon, and Rockefeller, each family owns five times the total shares held by Americans who rely on wage income. The income that workers receive from shares is negligible, and in fact, it is fictitious.

Berle also asserts that the U.S. government simply does not allow "stock tycoons to dictate to it or be used to serve their interests… [The U.S.] government intervenes in the activities of stockbrokers at all times to guide the economic system to benefit society."

The fact is that in 1955, among the two hundred and seventy-two responsible government positions in the Eisenhower administration, one hundred and fifty were directly occupied by big capitalists, but not a single position was granted to workers. This is the most direct and most open rule of stock tycoons, an open rule that has never existed in all of American history. And now everyone already knows that the most powerful one among them, Rockefeller, is preparing to become the president of the United States. One of his Democratic competitors, Kennedy, also owns one hundred million dollars in capital.

During the 1930s, under the pressure of a powerful American people's movement, President Franklin Roosevelt's government implemented some social legislation. This legislation is now far behind developed capitalist countries in Europe, let alone socialist countries.

But now it is necessary to restore the "normal" order of things. Under this order, the U.S. government has abandoned social legislation, begun to play the role of strike-breaker to help capitalists, and extracted huge amounts of taxes from the people. The vast majority of these taxes fall into the pockets of capitalists in the form of military orders and various subsidies.

Finally, Berle asserts that the real wages of American workers increase by 3% every year, and the American working class has the highest standard of living in the world.

Even official materials, which often describe situations in a distorted tone, only say that the wages of American workers have increased by an average of only 1.5% per year in the post-war period. This is simply incomparable to the rapid increase in wages and living standards of Soviet workers.

Many American workers have cars, televisions, and perhaps other things. However, the vast majority of Americans cannot get necessary medical treatment and ordinary rest. Their children do not receive a good education. Millions of families struggling in unemployment or low wages know what hunger and cold taste like.

We have not been damaged by war, but fifteen million American families, that is, one-third of the residents, are crowded like rats in slums and dilapidated houses, lacking basic sanitation. The AFL-CIO has stated that slums have been registered, but the U.S. government ignores the call to build 2.3 million homes each year. This call requires that some low-cost housing be built in these homes so that low-wage families can move in, to ensure that all Americans have housing by 1975.

Twenty-five million black people, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and Indians can only enjoy individual elements of the "American way of life." From the large number of segregated private schools for white and colored people established in northern American cities, to the use of prison labor on major thoroughfares in Florida, and the actual existence of Mexican slave labor on farms in the southwestern United States—in all these aspects, the vast majority of this group is shrouded in the magic of cruel oppression.

Not long ago, an investigation was conducted on the health conditions of eighty typical Puerto Rican families living in New York. Written in a cold tone, this investigation report detailed the terrible lives of these people: their abject poverty, slums, rapidly spreading diseases, inability to obtain medical treatment, children with no place to sleep, no place to go to school, and intolerable racial discrimination…

The author of this investigation report happens to be Berle's wife: Beatrice Berle. Before talking emptily about our "affluent society," she should have reread this investigation report to her husband.

As for the high labor productivity in the United States, what is worth noting here is the cunning methods by which American capitalists extract such high profits from such productivity, and their shameless public cry that workers' wages are increasing too quickly.

Berle's discussion of the competition between the two systems occupies an entire chapter in his book. This is a collection of lies and confused concepts. It is impossible to analyze it in detail in this short article.

Berle believes that American capitalism and Soviet socialism will become more and more similar. He also talked about the possibility of cooperation between the two major powers in providing economic assistance to underdeveloped countries. However, if there are individual words of peaceful coexistence here, they are buried in this chapter full of disgusting anti-Soviet political clamor.

That's about Berle. As for the title of the article in "The New York Times" mentioned at the beginning of this article, many facts can lead to definite conclusions.

Marx was right. The contradictions of the capitalist system are increasingly leading it to serious economic and political crises. Sooner or later, the working class of all countries will replace capitalism with socialism.

Khrushchev was also right. The existing socialist countries will catch up with the existing capitalist countries in the economic field, and will create the highest standard of living in human history in a short historical period.

And Berle is wrong. His "People's Capitalism" is a blatant fraud. The American people will learn to observe things correctly and draw correct conclusions from them. (Translated from the November 24th "Soviet Russia Daily")

### 1960年式的“人民资本主义”

    1960年式的“人民资本主义”
    美国经济学家　维克托·佩洛
    11月7日，伟大十月社会主义革命周年那天，我拿起一份报纸，上面刊登了广告业协会主席汤姆斯·斯·李普拉尔的一篇讲话。
    他在那篇讲话中声称，共产党人歪曲了“美国的制度”。他说，美国的宣传家们应当用标志着“社会主义的慈善的”资本主义思想来对付共产党人的攻击。
    他接着讲道：“我们应当使自己表现为普通人的真正保护者，表现为真正的革命家，即那种骑在把我们推向未来的大浪上的人，表现为前进着的生气勃勃的领导者，而不是一种奄奄待毙的社会。”李普拉尔要他的听众认清一件“了如指掌的事实，就是已经出现了一种新的资本主义。在这种资本主义下，劳动人民已成为资本大王”……
    我扭开收音机，想听一听新出现的美国“工人资本大王”会出来游行庆祝一下李普拉尔先生宣布的所谓新“革命”。但是广播员的第一个广播却是：“今天美国最高法院批准了采用塔夫脱—哈特莱法来对付罢工的钢铁工人。现在五十万钢铁工人必须回去工作。”
    哦！美国最高法院中握有权力的绅士们竟不知道美国工人已成了“资本大王”。法官们更加奋力保护雇佣奴役和压迫的老方法，支持着私有制的统治和私有主的政权。
    钢铁大王们笑逐颜开了。他们公司的股票在华尔街飞快地上升。在政府公然用命令支持下，各个公司已能强迫工人加快劳动，完全忽视技术安全，并把钢铁工业中的工人就业人数较1946年削减三分之一。
    五年以前资本主义的理论家们就竞相为他们的制度创造新名称，好设法把它美化一下。李普拉尔压倒了所有的人。他创造了“人民资本主义”的名称。现在由于社会主义社会的飞跃进步，苏联的科学成就以及不久前在美国爆发的战后最严重的一次经济危机，他同其他一些推销“人民资本主义”思想的人都过着不走运的时光。
    在美国，“人民资本主义”的宣传曾经欺骗了相当大一部分中产阶级人士、职员以及一部分待遇较好的体力劳动者。不久前，一些工会曾揭穿过资本主义幻想。但是一部分受反动宣传影响较深的劳动者仍抱有这种错误的思想。
    现在资本主义辩护士又开始了新的宣传阶段。他们在运用旧手法的同时，更经常地来比较社会主义制度和资本主义制度，因为苏联对经济竞赛的呼吁已越来越具有现实性。
    于是李普拉尔的粗暴宣传就很像马戏团的强行拉客者。
    在“人民资本主义”的宣传家中有哥伦比亚大学法学教授亚道尔夫·亚·贝尔。但是他并不是关在象牙之塔中的学者，而是出名的政客，同时又是大公司法律顾问兼“美国糖蜜公司”董事长。尽管贝尔并不是金融巨子，但是他却以年收入达六千万美元的企业主身份在纽约证券交易所登记。
    贝尔以前的著作大多是具体研究和荒谬理论的混合物。但是他最近出版的几本书却是毫无认真研究迹象的赤裸裸的宣传品。
    在他几年前出版的“二十世纪资本主义的革命”一书中，贝尔曾竭力证明，美国大公司是有“灵魂”的，像中世纪的国王一样，对它的下属抱有父亲般的关怀。他最近出版了一本书叫做“没有财产的权威”。其基本内容由作者在“纽约时报”的一篇文章中作了介绍。那篇文章的题目是：“马克思不正确而赫鲁晓夫也一样”……
    以下是他为夸耀1960年式的美国“人民资本主义”所作的毫不新鲜的论据。
    贝尔断言，现在领导美国大公司的并不是证券市场的巨子，而是专业经理，后者只是一种特别的“公职”。他说：这些经理拥有“权威但是却没有财产”。
    的确，贝尔笔头一转就把美国的工业都“社会化”了。
    事实真像如何呢？
    拥有亿万收入的家族继续控制着美国的企业。经理和企业高级管理人员如果他们本人不是大家族的成员也基本上是出身于资产阶级上层圈子。
    贝尔本人在他的所谓“例外”中承认：福特控制着“福特汽车公司”，杜邦控制着“杜邦公司”，梅隆控制着“美国铝公司”，哈特福特家族控制着“大西洋和太平洋茶叶公司”。这些都是在化学、制铝、汽车工业和零售贸易方面的大公司。最大的汽车公司“通用汽车公司”则是由杜邦所控制。
    毫无疑问，洛克菲勒控制“美孚油公司”，正像福特控制以他的家族名字命名的公司一样。我不了解，贝尔为什么不把“美孚油公司”列入他的“例外”的单子上去。
    不过，这也是可以理解的。贝尔在他的新著作中已承认，他是被纳尔逊·洛克菲勒雇佣来研究那些自力经营的公司的统计的。另外洛克菲勒的“大通曼哈顿银行”也在为“美国糖蜜公司”提供资金……
    贝尔认为自从美国股票持有者达到一千二百五十万人，还有五千万人“甚至不知道他们间接通过保险金和补助津贴……从股票中也得到收入”以来，许多美国人就直接掌握着美国的公司。
    在去年我写的一篇文章中，我曾指出，美国握有股票的五万个大家族手里集中了全国三分之二的股票。同时一半的股票持有者——小额持有者——一共只掌握1％的股票。这些股票完全不足以显著提高他们的收入。
    依靠工资收入的美国人只握有全部股份资本的千分之三，但三个最大的亿万富翁家族：杜邦、梅隆和洛克菲勒，每一个家族都拥有依靠工资收入的美国人所掌握的全部股份的五倍。工人从股份中得到的收入是微不足道的，而事实上这也是虚构的。
    贝尔还断言，美国政府根本不允许“股票大王们对它发号施令或被利用来为他们的利益服务……（美国）政府时时刻刻在干预股票经纪人的活动，以便指导经济制度为社会造福”。
    事实却是1955年在艾森豪威尔政府的二百七十二个负责的政府职位中，就有一百五十个直接由大资本家占据，但其中没有一个职位是授予工人的。这是股票大王最直接和最公开的统治，是在全部美国历史上所从未有过的公开统治。而现在人人都已知道，他们中最厉害的一个，洛克菲勒已准备当美国的总统。他的民主党的竞争对手之一肯尼迪，也拥有一亿美元的资本。
    在三十年代时期，富兰克林·罗斯福总统的政府在强大的美国人民运动的压力下，曾实行了一些社会立法。这些立法到现在已大大落后于欧洲发达的资本主义国家，更不用说社会主义国家了。
    可是现在又需要恢复事物的“正常”秩序了。在这种秩序下，美国政府已把社会立法丢到一边，开始扮演破坏罢工的角色来帮忙资本家，并从人民身上榨取巨额赋税。这些税的绝大部分都以军事订货和形形色色的津贴形式落入资本家的荷包。
    最后，贝尔断言，美国工人的实际工资每年增加3％，美国工人阶级拥有世界最高的生活水平。
    甚至常以歪曲的调子来描述情况的官方材料，也只说战后时期美国工人工资每年平均只增加1.5％。这同苏联工人工资和生活水平的迅速上升简直不能相提并论。
    许多美国工人有汽车、电视机，可能还有其他东西。但是绝大多数美国人却无法得到必要的医药治疗和普通的休养。他们的孩子受不到良好教育。在失业或低工资中挣扎度日的几百万个家庭是晓得什么是饥饿和寒冷的滋味的。
    我们并没有受到战争损害，但是一千五百个美国家庭，就是说三分之一的居民，却像老鼠一样挤在贫民窟和残墙断壁的房子中，缺乏起码的卫生条件。劳联—产联工会联合会曾声明，贫民窟都已进行了登记，但是美国政府却漠视要求每年建造二百三十万栋房屋的呼吁。这项呼吁要求在这些房屋中也建筑一些让低工资的家庭能迁入居住的廉价房屋，以保证到1975年美国人都有房子住。
    两千五百万黑人、波多黎各人、墨西哥人和印第安人只能享受到“美国生活方式”中的个别因素。从美国北部城市中大量建立的白人和有色人种分开受教育的私立学校起，直到佛罗里达主要干线上的利用囚犯劳动以及在美国西南部农场中实际存在的墨西哥人的奴隶劳动——在所有这些方面，这部分人的绝大多数都在残酷压迫的魔力笼罩下。
    不久前，对居住在纽约的八十家典型的波多黎各人的家庭卫生条件进行了调查。用冷酷的笔调写出来的这份调查报告对这些人的可怖的生活作了详尽的描述：他们的贫困不堪、贫民窟、迅速蔓延的疾病、无法得到医疗，孩子们没有地方睡觉，没有地方上学，令人无法容忍的种族歧视……
    这个调查报告的作者正好是贝尔的妻子：比特里莎·贝尔。在空谈我们的“富足的社会”之前，她本来应当把这份调查报告也向她的丈夫重读一遍。
    至于说到美国的高度劳动生产率，那么这里值得注意的倒是美国资本家怎样从这样的生产率中汲取那么高的利润的狡猾手法，以及他们公然高叫劳动者工资增加太快的无耻。
    贝尔关于两个制度竞赛的议论，占了他书中整整一章。这是一个集谎话、混乱的概念之大成于一身的东西。在这篇短文中不可能对它作详尽的分析。
    贝尔认为美国的资本主义和苏联的社会主义将会越来越相像。他也谈到这两个大国在给不发达国家以经济援助方面可能合作。不过，如果说这里也有和平共处的个别字句，那么它们是淹埋在这一章的充满令人作呕的反苏政治叫嚣中。
    关于贝尔的事情就是如此。至于说本文开始时提到的在“纽约时报”上的那篇文章的题目，那么许多事实就可以引出确定的结论。
    马克思是正确的。资本主义制度的矛盾正在越来越厉害地把它引向严重的经济和政治危机。所有国家的工人阶级迟早都要用社会主义来代替资本主义。
    赫鲁晓夫也是正确的。现存的社会主义国家在经济领域中将赶上现存的资本主义国家，并将在短短的历史时期内创造历史上人类最高的生活水平。
    而贝尔则是不正确的。他的“人民资本主义”是一种明显的骗局。美国人民将学会正确观察事物，并从其中得出正确的结论。（亚译自11月24日“苏维埃俄罗斯报”）
