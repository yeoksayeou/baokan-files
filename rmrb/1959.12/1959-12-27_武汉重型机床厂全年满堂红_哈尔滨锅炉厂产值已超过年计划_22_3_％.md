Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th. China’s largest modern factory manufacturing heavy machine tools – Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory – has already overfulfilled this year's state plan ahead of schedule. As of December 23rd, the factory's total output value has exceeded the annual plan by 5.6%, product output has exceeded the annual plan by 1.6%, all product output meets national standards, and product costs and labor productivity have also overfulfilled the annual plan.

The most significant feature of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory's execution of its plan this year is the adoption of a method in which specific personnel are responsible for production planning and scheduling. They pushed the plan directly to the grassroots level, meeting with production workers, so that workers were well-informed, knowing both their monthly tasks and grasping the key to completing the plan. Workers formulated specific production schedules based on the tasks and key points, completing production tasks on time. In the production process, factory leaders also went deep into the grassroots levels at any time, mobilizing the masses to solve key problems. For example, for a long period this year, casting supplies were always unable to keep up, becoming a key bottleneck in production. Factory leaders cultivated experimental plots in the casting workshop, changing the backward state of casting production. In November, the production of iron castings even exceeded the highest designed level.

Throughout the completion of this year's plan, all factory workers have been vigorously engaged in technical innovation from beginning to end. In November alone, more than 4,000 workers throughout the factory participated in skill competitions, putting forward more than 20,000 technical innovation proposals. The heavy parts division of the Second Workshop universally carried out technical innovation, increasing the overall production level of the entire division by an average of one-fold. Due to the increase in production efficiency, the machine tools produced by the factory in September, October, and November exceeded the total produced from January to August.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 26th. While completing this year's state plan ahead of schedule, the Harbin Boiler Factory has already made various preparations for a flying start to next year's production.

The factory's total output value plan for this year has already exceeded the annual plan by 22.3% to date. The plan for increasing production and practicing economy of the main product, power station boilers, has also been completed ahead of schedule. Calculated by electricity generation capacity, it has exceeded the national planned target by 47.4%, more than doubling compared to last year. These power station boilers have supported many power stations across the country, and have been proven to be of good product quality after operational inspections by various power stations. The factory's comparable product costs have been reduced by 9.5% compared to last year. The profit delivery plan has also been overfulfilled by 2% ahead of schedule.

In order to ensure a flying start, a successful ten-day period, a successful month, and an all-round success in the first quarter of next year's production, the Harbin Boiler Factory mobilized the masses to focus on the preparation work for next year's production very early. The factory's measures for the preparation of new products for next year, etc., have now been communicated to the workshops, sections, and groups along with the production operation plan, and the masses are being fully mobilized to further discuss them. The sixteen key topics proposed by the technical department for the technical preparation for the first quarter of next year have now been broken through after mass observation and demonstrations. The process room has completed all the process documents for the 280-ton boiler. The design room organized a tool fixture "assembly line" performance competition, completing five varieties and twenty-five design items in just over four hours, increasing efficiency by 7.8 times. Because the masses were mobilized to carry out competitions, the equipment that was originally scheduled to be overhauled by the end of the year was completely overhauled ahead of schedule on December 24th. The quantity of steel needed for production in the first quarter of next year has been basically resolved.

　　武汉重型机床厂全年满堂红
    哈尔滨锅炉厂产值已超过年计划22.3％
    据新华社武汉26日电　我国目前最大的制造重型机床的现代化工厂——武汉重型机床厂，已经提前超额完成了今年的国家计划。到12月23日止，全厂总产值已超过年计划5.6％，产品产量超过年计划1.6％，产品产量全部合乎国家规定标准，产品成本和劳动生产率也都超额完成了全年计划。
    武汉重型机床厂今年执行计划的最大特点，是采取了由专人抓生产计划和调度工作的方法。他们把计划一竿子插到底，同生产工人见面，这样，就使工人心中有数，既知道每月的任务，也掌握了完成计划的关键。工人们按照任务和关键编出具体生产进度，准时完成生产任务。在生产过程中，全厂领导干部还随时深入基层，发动群众解决关键问题。例如今年较长时期铸件始终供应不上，成为生产关键，工厂领导就在铸造车间种试验田，改变了铸件生产的落后状况，11月份铸铁件的生产甚至超过了设计最高水平。
    全厂职工在完成今年计划中，自始至终地大闹技术革新。仅在11月份，全厂参加对手赛的职工就有四千多人，提出了技术革新建议两万多条。第二车间重大件工部普遍开展技术革新，使整个工部生产水平平均提高一倍。由于生产效率的提高，全厂在9、10、11三个月里生产的机床，超过了1月至8月份的总和。
    据新华社哈尔滨26日电　哈尔滨锅炉厂在提前超额完成今年国家计划的同时，已经为明年生产开门红做好了各项准备工作。
    这个工厂今年的总产值计划到目前止已经超过年计划22.3％；主要产品电站锅炉的增产节约计划也已提前完成，按发电量计算已超过国家计划指标47.4％。比去年增长一倍以上。这些电站锅炉已经支援了全国许多电站，经各电站运行检验，证明产品质量良好。工厂的可比产品成本比去年降低9.5％。上缴利润计划也已超额2％提前完成。
    为了确保明年生产开门红、旬旬红、月月红、首季满堂红，哈尔滨锅炉厂很早就发动群众抓明年生产的准备工作。厂里制订的明年新产品准备等项措施，现在已同生产作业计划一起层层下达到车间、工段、小组，正在充分发动群众进一步讨论。技术部门为明年第一季度技术准备所提出的十六个关键课题，经过群众性的观摩表演，现在都已经被突破。工艺室已经完成二百八十吨锅炉全部工艺文件；设计室组织工具夹具“一条龙”表演赛，四个多小时就完成五个品种、二十五项设计，提高效率七点八倍。因为发动群众开展竞赛，原定在年底才能检修完的设备，在12月24日就提前全部检修完毕。明年第一季度生产所需的钢材，数量上已经基本解决。
