Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 3rd: Dalian railway and Dalian port are cooperating closely, organizing a "one-dragon" coal transportation system, greatly improving transportation efficiency. From mid-October to the present, the Dalian railway department has shortened the time for 3,215 car hours out of the 12,692 coal cars received; the port has loaded 54 ships, reducing the average ship berthing time by half, thereby greatly increasing the freight volume of the port and railway.

The "one-dragon" coal transportation system is a good way to link the production, transportation, and sales of coal through the close connection of land and water transportation. The method is to use direct trains to transport coal from coal mines such as Hegang and Jixi to the GanJingZi station in Dalian, and then transfer it from the GanJingZi station to ships berthed at Dalian Port for transport to East China. Because the train and ship schedules and routes are closely connected, the arrival and departure of goods are more balanced, the proportion of direct transshipment between cars and ships is increased, and the phenomenon of cars waiting to be unloaded and ships waiting to be loaded is basically eliminated, accelerating the turnaround of cars and ships. Taking GanJingZi Station as an example, in the past month, the average proportion of direct transshipment between cars and ships reached 73%, an increase of 20% compared with the past. In this way, in the port's ship loading operations, the procedure of unloading from the car and then moving it again is reduced, saving more than 165,000 yuan in expenses; due to the faster unloading speed of the railway, 1,782 more coal cars were unloaded in the past month, and the number of unloaded cars waiting on the station was reduced by an average of 5.4% compared to the past.

In the implementation of the "one-dragon" coal transportation system, the railway department and the port established a cooperation office, and established a system of "ten unifications" including ideology, leadership, dispatching, planning, shifts, and competition, maintaining close contact and actively cooperating. Due to the development of competition, the efficiency of coal car overturning and unloading has increased from 15 to 20 cars per hour in the past to 25 to 31 cars; the efficiency of ship loading has also been significantly improved. In the past, it took an average of 25 to 30 hours to load a 10,000-ton ship, but now it has been shortened to an average of 15.5 hours, and the shortest time has reached 11.6 hours. This also greatly helps to improve the efficiency of "one-dragon" transportation.

### 大连铁路海港协作联运  长龙运煤  多快好省

    大连铁路海港协作联运
    长龙运煤  多快好省
    火车和轮船的班期线路紧密衔接
    车等卸和船等装的现象基本消灭
    新华社沈阳3日电　大连铁路部门和大连海港大协作，组织煤炭“一条龙”运输，大大提高运输效率。从10月中旬到目前，大连铁路部门在接进一万二千六百九十二辆煤车中，共缩短三千二百一十五个车小时；海港装出五十四艘轮船，船只停泊时间平均缩短一半，因而大大增加了海港和铁路的货运量。
    煤炭“一条龙”运输是通过水陆交通工具的紧密衔接把煤炭的产、运、销联系起来的一种好形式。它的作法是用直达列车把鹤岗、鸡西等煤矿的煤，运到大连的甘井子车站，在甘井子车站与大连海港停泊的轮船进行车船换装运往华东。由于火车轮船的班期线路紧密衔接，就使货物的到发接运更加平衡，提高了车船直接换装的比重，基本消灭了车等卸、船等装的现象，加速了车船周转。以甘井子站为例，近一个月车船直接换装比重平均达到73％，比过去提高20％。这样，在海港装船作业中就减少了从车上卸下又搬起来的工序，节省了十六万五千多元的费用；铁路由于卸车速度加快，一个月来多卸了一千七百八十二辆煤车，站上的待卸车皮比过去平均减少了5.4％。
    在实行煤炭“一条龙”运输大协作中，铁路部门和海港成立了协作办公室，建立了思想、领导、调度、计划、班次、竞赛等“十统一”的制度，密切联系，主动配合。由于开展了竞赛，煤车翻卸效率由过去每小时十五到二十车，提高到二十五到三十一车；轮船装船效率也显著提高，过去平均装一艘万吨船需要二十五到三十个小时，现在平均缩短到十五点五小时，最短达到十一点六小时。这样，也大大有助于提高“一条龙”运输的效率。
