    A small number of people believe that it is not necessary to use communist ideology to lead when implementing socialist principles. In their view, as long as material incentives are strengthened, "small private ownership" and "small freedom" are developed more, and the interests of small collectives are taken care of more, people's labor enthusiasm can be stimulated and socialist construction can be "done well." This is obviously wrong.
    Socialist principles are the basis for us to formulate various guidelines and policies during the historical period of socialist construction. In the stage of socialist construction, it is necessary to encourage people's labor enthusiasm from the perspective of material interests and appropriately take care of the interests of "small freedom" and "small collectives." Because the current level of productivity in our country is still relatively low, there are still differences among workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and manual labor, and old ideas of capitalism that are afraid of hard work and want to gain without working still remain in people's minds. This determines that under socialist conditions, it is necessary to implement the principle of distribution according to work and material incentives that reflect distribution according to work. This is in line with the current level of productive forces and the level of awareness of the people in our country. However, the implementation of socialist principles must also be led by communist ideology. This has two meanings: one is to guide the current socialist construction victoriously, and the other is to prepare conditions for the future transition to communism. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that socialism and communism are two stages of a social formation. They have both differences and connections. If we do not use communist ideology to lead the construction of socialism, we will easily lose our direction, lack a clear goal of struggle, easily be content with the status quo, and delay the speed of socialist construction. As early as the democratic revolution period, Chairman Mao pointed out: "At present, there is no doubt that we should expand the propaganda of communist ideology and intensify the study of Marxism-Leninism. Without such propaganda and study, we will not only be unable to guide the Chinese revolution to the future socialist stage, but also unable to guide the current democratic revolution to victory." Now our revolution has entered the socialist stage. Chairman Mao emphasized the important significance of expanding communist propaganda during the democratic revolution period. Today, strengthening communist ideological education is of course even more important. Therefore, we must use communist ideology to lead, conduct in-depth socialist and communist education, and truly enable the broad masses of cadres and people to have a high degree of enthusiasm and lofty ideals for building socialism and communism, and carry forward the communist style of selflessness, disregard for remuneration, and selfless labor.
    The reason why we want to use communist ideology to lead is also because there is class struggle in the transition period. The socialist revolution on our country's economic front has been basically completed, and the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has also achieved a decisive victory, but the class struggle has not stopped. It will continue to exist throughout the transition period until the ideological and political influence of the bourgeoisie is finally eliminated. The class struggle in the transition period will inevitably be reflected in our party and within the revolutionary ranks. The current anti-socialist activities of a small handful of right-leaning opportunists in our country are precisely this reflection. They negate the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement, and attempt to pull socialism backward and restore capitalism in our country, which represents the wishes and demands of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, only by using communist ideology to lead can we improve the political consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and people and smash any form of attack from the bourgeoisie.

### 社会主义原则加共产主义思想

    社会主义原则加共产主义思想
    有一小部分人认为实行社会主义原则，并不需要用共产主义思想来挂帅。在他们看来，只要加强物质鼓励，多多发展“小私有”、“小自由”，多多照顾小集体的利益，就可以刺激人们的劳动积极性，“搞好”社会主义建设事业。显然这是错误的。
    社会主义原则是我们在社会主义建设历史时期，制定各项方针政策的依据。在社会主义建设阶段，从物质利益方面鼓励人们的劳动积极性，适当的照顾“小自由”、“小集体”的利益是必要的。因为目前我国的生产力水平还比较低，在工农之间、城乡之间、脑力劳动与体力劳动之间还存在着差别，在人们的意识中还残存着资本主义的好逸恶劳、不劳而获的旧思想等等，这就决定了在社会主义条件下，必须实行按劳分配原则和体现按劳分配的物质鼓励等措施。这是和我国目前生产力发展水平及人们觉悟程度相适应的。但是实行社会主义原则，还必须用共产主义思想来挂帅。这有两方面的意义：一是为了胜利地指导当前的社会主义建设，一是为将来过渡到共产主义准备条件。马克思列宁主义教导我们，社会主义和共产主义是一个社会形态的两个阶段，两者既有差别又有联系，建设社会主义如果不用共产主义思想来挂帅，就容易迷失方向，缺乏明确的奋斗目标，就容易安于现状，延迟社会主义的建设速度。毛主席早在民主革命时期就曾经指出：“在现时，毫无疑义，应该扩大共产主义思想的宣传，加紧马克思列宁主义的学习，没有这种宣传和学习，不但不能引导中国革命到将来的社会主义阶段上去，而且也不能指导现时的民主革命达到胜利。”现时我们的革命已经进入到社会主义阶段了，毛主席在民主革命时期尚且强调扩大共产主义宣传的重要意义，今天加强共产主义思想教育当然就更为重要了。因此，我们必须用共产主义思想来挂帅，深入地进行社会主义和共产主义教育，使广大干部和群众真正具有建设社会主义、共产主义的高度热情和远大理想，发扬大公无私、不计报酬、忘我劳动的共产主义风格。
    我们之所以要用共产主义思想来挂帅，还在于过渡时期存在阶级斗争。我国经济战线上的社会主义革命已经基本完成，政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命也取得了决定性的胜利，但是阶级斗争并没有停息，它在整个过渡时期内将继续存在，直至资产阶级的思想政治影响最后消灭为止。而过渡时期的阶级斗争，必然要反映到我们党内和革命队伍内部来。当前在我国出现的一小撮右倾机会主义分子的反社会主义活动，正是这种反映。他们否定总路线、大跃进和人民公社化运动，企图把社会主义拉向后退，使资本主义在我国复辟，就是代表着资产阶级的愿望和要求。因此，我们只有用共产主义思想来挂帅，才能提高广大干部和群众的政治觉悟，粉碎来自资产阶级方面的任何形式的进攻。
