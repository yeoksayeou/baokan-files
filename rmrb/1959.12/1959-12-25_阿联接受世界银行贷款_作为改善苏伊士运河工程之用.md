The Central Ministry of Economy of the United Arab Republic issued a communique tonight announcing that, with the approval of the World Bank's Board of Directors, the Suez Canal Authority of the UAR and the World Bank, headquartered in the United States, signed a loan agreement in Washington on the 22nd. The agreement stipulates that the World Bank will provide a loan of US$56.65 million for the UAR to improve the Suez Canal project.

Younis, Chairman and General Manager of the Board of Directors of the Suez Canal Authority, and Black, President of the World Bank, signed the agreement on behalf of the Canal Authority and the Bank, respectively. Kamal, the UAR Ambassador to the United States, signed the agreement on behalf of the UAR government to guarantee the Canal Authority's repayment of the loan.

The loan negotiations, which lasted about a year, stipulated an annual interest rate of 6% for the loan, with a term of fifteen years. Repayment will begin on March 15, 1962.

　　阿联接受世界银行贷款
    作为改善苏伊士运河工程之用
    新华社开罗22日电　阿拉伯联合共和国中央经济部今晚发表公报宣布，在世界银行董事会的同意下，阿联苏伊士运河管理当局和总部设在美国的世界银行22日在华盛顿签订了一项贷款协定，规定世界银行提供五千六百五十万美元的贷款，作为阿联改善苏伊士运河工程之用。
    苏伊士运河管理局董事会董事长兼总经理尤尼斯和世界银行行长布莱克代表运河当局和银行方面在协定上签字。阿联驻美国大使卡迈勒代表阿联政府在协定上签字，以保证运河管理局偿还这笔贷款。
    这次持续了一年左右的贷款谈判规定贷款年利率为6％，为期十五年。偿还日期从1962年3月15日开始。
    据公报说，八家美国银行和一家日本银行也参加提供这一笔贷款。这九家私营银行将提供五百多万美元贷款，而不由世界银行担保。
    公报估计，苏伊士运河改进工程的总费用为三千七百六十万镑（约合一亿美元）。据宣布，这项加宽加深的改进工程完工后，吃水三十七英尺的轮船可通过运河。现在只能通过吃水三十五英尺的船只。
