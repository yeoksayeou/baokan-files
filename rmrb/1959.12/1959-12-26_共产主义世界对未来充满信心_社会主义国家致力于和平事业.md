British Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Johnson's Christmas Message

　　I recently visited China, which is more civilized than any country in the Western world because it has eliminated hunger. The movement symbolized by the People's Communes has filled young people and even the elderly with new hope and enthusiasm.

　　Xinhua News Agency, London, December 23rd - The "Workers' Daily" today published the Christmas message of Dr. Johnson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in which he said that the communist world is not afraid of its future.

　　He said that socialist countries are "committed to peace rather than war, their economies have eliminated many of the internal contradictions and conflicts suffered by the Western world, they have nothing to gain from war or the threat of war, their economies require peace, and therefore they must strive for peace."

　　Dr. Johnson said, "The voice of the world's masses is growing stronger, especially the voice of the people, who are worried about war and whose financial interests require them to get rid of the extremely large arms production."

　　He added, "Some American financial groups recently said in a national publication in the United States that 'a sudden peace would be a great disaster for American enterprises.' This means that a sudden peace or any peace must be delayed. It is becoming increasingly difficult for them to say this frankly now."

　　He continued, "The accuracy of artificial satellites and lunar rockets shows that New York or London could also be hit within minutes."

　　The Archbishop then said: "I recently visited China, which is more civilized than any country in the Western world because it has eliminated hunger."

　　He told readers that when he was in China he visited the People's Communes. "The commune symbolizes the movement that is unfolding across the country with lightning speed, a movement that has eliminated fundamental worries, filled young people and even the elderly with new hope and new enthusiasm; and pointed out the glorious task of raising the living standards of 650 million people and enriching their lives as a common goal of the people.

　　共产主义世界对未来充满信心  社会主义国家致力于和平事业
    英国坎特伯雷教长  约翰逊博士圣诞献辞
    我最近访问过中国，它比西方世界的任何国家都要文明，因为它已经消灭了饥饿。以人民公社为象征的运动使得青年人甚至老年人都充满了新的希望和新的热情。
    新华社伦敦23日电　“工人日报”今天刊载了坎特伯雷教长约翰逊博士的圣诞献辞，他在献辞中说，共产主义世界对它的未来无所畏惧。
    他说，社会主义国家“致力于和平而不是战争，他们的经济已经消灭了西方世界所遭受着的很多内部矛盾的冲突，他们无须从战争或战争威胁中得到任何东西，他们的经济要求和平，因此他们必然要争取和平。”
    约翰逊博士说，“世界群众的呼声日益强大，特别是人民的呼声，他们对战争感到忧虑，他们的财政利益要求摆脱极庞大的军备生产。”
    他又说，“美国某些财团不久前在美国一家全国性刊物上说过这样的话，‘突然的和平将对美国企业造成巨大的灾难’，这就是说，突然的和平或者任何和平必须延缓。他们现在要直率地这样说是越来越困难了。”
    他继续说，“人造卫星和月球火箭的准确性表明，纽约或伦敦也可以在几分钟内受到命中的打击。”
    这位教长接着说：“我最近访问过中国，它比西方世界的任何国家都要文明，因为它已经消灭了饥饿”。
    他告诉读者说，当他在中国的时候他曾经访问过人民公社。“公社象征着以闪电般的速度在全国各地展开的那个运动，这个运动已经消除了根本的忧虑，使青年人甚至是老年人充满新的希望和新的热情；并且指出了提高六亿五千万人民的生活水准和丰富他们的生活的光荣任务作为人民共同的目标。
