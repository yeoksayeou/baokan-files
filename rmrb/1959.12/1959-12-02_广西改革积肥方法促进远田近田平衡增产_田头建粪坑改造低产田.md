    Guangxi Reforms Manure Accumulation Methods to Promote Balanced Production Increase in Distant and Nearby Fields; Building Manure Pits in Fields to Transform Low-Yielding Fields
    Nanning, December 1 (report from this newspaper) The vast rural areas of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are building manure pits and field fertilizer stations on a large scale, and are rebuilding cattle and pig pens at the edges of the fields. This is a major reform in agricultural production.
    Building the "factory" for accumulating and creating fertilizer in the fields facilitates the on-site accumulation of large quantities of high-quality organic fertilizer, as well as on-site fertilizer supply, saving a great deal of labor in transporting fertilizer. In Guangxi, distant fields are generally five or six *li* away from the village, and some are as far as twenty *li*, and one must also climb mountains and cross ridges, taking two or three hours for a round trip. Transporting fertilizer is even more difficult, with each person carrying only four or five *dan* of fertilizer per day, and at most no more than ten *dan*. If we calculate that each *mu* requires 300 to 500 *dan* of fertilizer, and each person delivers 10 *dan* of fertilizer per day, then transporting fertilizer to distant fields throughout the autonomous region would require 300 to 500 million labor days. The construction of field fertilizer "factories" will greatly save transportation manpower.
    More importantly, the construction of field manure pits and fertilizer stations can effectively eliminate low-yield fields and achieve balanced production increases in grain output. According to surveys, distant and poor fields account for about 30% of all cultivated land in Guangxi, totaling 10 million *mu*. These fields are far from the village, receive little fertilizer, and are cultivated extensively, so their yields are very low, generally 150 to 200 *jin* per *mu*. In this year's continued leap forward in agriculture, many places have seized the transformation of low-yield fields as a key link, vigorously building field manure pits and field pigsties. The late rice yield in low-yield fields in places like Luchuan, Rongxian, Cenxi, and Hengxian has generally increased by about 100%. After the widespread construction of field manure pits in Muge Commune, Guixian County, not only was a large amount of labor saved, but the historically low-yield situation of distant mountain fields was fundamentally changed. Of the commune's 49,960 *mu* of late rice, 16,500 *mu* were low-yield fields. As of November 8, the commune had harvested 31,363 *mu*, with an average yield per *mu* increasing by nearly 50% compared to last year. Among them, 6,679 *mu* of distant mountain fields increased by more than 200% compared to the previous average yield per *mu*, approaching the average yield level of the commune's late rice this year. Therefore, the widespread establishment of field manure pits is an important measure to implement the "fertilizer" and "soil" principles and is an effective method to promote balanced production increases.
    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee believes that establishing field manure pits and transforming low-yield fields are important measures to achieve a continued leap forward in agriculture next year and has decided to promote them universally. All localities warmly support this decision, conducting extensive publicity and mobilization through various forms. Many places have also launched a mass debate of "four checks" (checking distance, checking yield, checking fertilizer, and checking manpower) and "three calculations" (calculating seasonal accounts, calculating work accounts, and calculating production increase accounts), and the mass movement to build field fertilizer "factories" has been vigorously launched. In Yangshuo County, an army of 50,000 laborers worked hard for 24 days to build 6,527 field fertilizer stations, averaging one fertilizer station for every 21 *mu* of distant and poor fields in the county. People's communes in the Liuzhou Special District organized construction teams, and by early November, they had built 4,600 pig and cattle pens. The Yulin Special District, which started early, had built more than 25,000 field manure pits, and many pits were already full of manure.
    In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient materials, communes and brigades in mountainous and plain areas also carried out mutual cooperation. For example, production teams in mountainous areas of Pingnan County lacked lime, so production teams in plain areas gave priority to burning lime for them; production teams in plain areas lacked firewood and timber, so production teams in mountainous areas rushed to transport them, ensuring the smooth progress of fertilizer infrastructure construction.

### 广西改革积肥方法促进远田近田平衡增产  田头建粪坑改造低产田

    广西改革积肥方法促进远田近田平衡增产
    田头建粪坑改造低产田
    本报南宁1日电　广西僮族自治区广大农村，正在大规模修建田头粪坑、田间肥料站，并把牛栏猪圈改建在田头。这是农业生产上的一项重大改革。
    把积肥造肥的“工厂”建在田间，便于就地大量沤积有机质精肥，也便于就地供应肥料，节省大量运肥劳力。在广西，一般远田距离村庄五、六里路，有的远达二十里，而且还要爬山过坳，来往一次就得两三个钟头。运肥就更困难了，每人每天运肥四、五担，最多的也不过十担左右。如以每亩施肥三百担到五百担，每人每天送肥十担计算，全自治区远田运肥就需三亿到五亿个劳动日。田间肥料“工厂”的建设，将大大节省运输力量。
    更重要的是兴修田头粪坑和肥料站，能有效地消灭低产田，使粮食产量由不平衡到平衡增产。据调查，广西的远田、瘦田约占全部耕田的30％，共一千万亩。这些田离村远，施肥很少，耕作粗放，因此产量很低，一般亩产一百五十到二百斤。在今年农业继续跃进中，许多地方抓住改造低产田这一环，大搞田头粪坑、大修田头猪栏。陆川、容县、岑溪、横县等地的低产田，晚稻产量一般增产一倍左右。贵县木格公社在普建田头粪坑以后，不仅节约了大批劳动力，而且从根本上改变了山冲远田的历史低产面貌。全社四万九千九百六十亩晚稻，有一万六千五百亩是低产田。到11月8日止，全社已收割三万一千三百六十三亩，平均亩产比去年增产将近50％。其中六千六百七十九亩山冲远田，比过去平均亩产增加二倍多，接近今年全社晚稻平均产量的水平。因此，普遍建立田头粪坑，是贯彻执行“肥”、“土”两字的重要措施，是促进平衡增产的有效方法。
    中共广西僮族自治区党委认为，建立田头粪坑，改造低产田是实现明年农业继续跃进的一项重要措施，决定普遍推广。各地热烈拥护这个决定，通过各种形式大宣传大动员，许多地方还开展了“四查”（查路程、查产量、查肥料、查人力）“三算”（算季节账、算出工账、算增产账）的大辩论，大建田间肥料“工厂”的群众运动便蓬勃展开起来。阳朔县五万劳动大军苦战了二十四天，建成田间肥料站六千五百二十七个，全县十四万亩远田瘦田平均每二十一亩就有肥料站一个。柳州专区各人民公社组织了基建队，到11月上旬，已建成猪栏牛栏四千六百个。动工早的玉林专区已建成田头粪坑二万五千多个，很多粪坑已沤满了粪。
    为了克服物资不足的困难，山区和平原的公社、大队还开展互相协作。如平南县地处山区的生产队没有石灰，平原地区的生产队就优先给他们烧石灰；平原地区的生产队缺乏柴草和木料，山区的生产队就给他们赶运出来，保证了肥料基本建设顺利进行。
