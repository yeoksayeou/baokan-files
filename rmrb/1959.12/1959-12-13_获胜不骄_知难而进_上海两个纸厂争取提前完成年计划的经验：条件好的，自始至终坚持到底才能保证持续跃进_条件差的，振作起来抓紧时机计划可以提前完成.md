Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Yongkang): How can factories that are already able to complete this year's plan persist to the end and complete the plan even better? How can factories that have difficulties in completing this year's plan seize the opportunity and strive to complete the plan? Two paper mills in Shanghai have provided excellent experience in this regard. The situation of these two factories—China Paper Board Company and Shanghai Paper Mill—powerfully proves that thoroughly exposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale are very important guarantees for completing this year's plan.

The China Paper Board Company has the best equipment and technology in the Shanghai industry. In the first three quarters of this year, it completed 70% of the annual plan; product quality, labor productivity, and other technical and economic indicators have also improved compared to last year. Upon entering October, some cadres of this company revealed such a mood: According to the national plan, the fourth quarter only needs an average monthly production of 3,000 tons of paper to complete the annual task, and the company's output in September has already reached this level. Therefore, this year's plan is already a sure thing and can definitely be completed, so why bother to spend more effort?

The company's Party Committee discovered this mood and immediately convened a meeting to conduct inspections among all cadres and spread out the tasks for the fourth quarter, mobilizing everyone to discuss them. Unexpectedly, the more everyone discussed, the more problems arose, and the more problems arose, the more arduous the fourth quarter's tasks felt. Originally, although the output in this quarter was only 9,000 tons, the amount of industrial paper was much more than in the past; and the high-grade varieties of industrial paper increased even more. For example, photographic base paper, which needs to be produced in large quantities in the fourth quarter, takes three times as long to manufacture one ton than printing paper for packaging; on the other hand, the speed of paper machines throughout the company has generally increased this year, and the management work in some workshops has not quite kept up. Although the company's plan has been completed well, not all workshops and all machines can complete the targets, the gap between the advanced and the backward is still very large, and the potential is also very large; in addition, according to past experience, there are often urgent tasks to be completed before the end of the year, so it is necessary to prepare for further increases. The discussion of these issues made the cadres realize that completing the fourth quarter's tasks is indeed not an easy task.

In fact, at this time, the cadres had already seen the harmfulness of complacency through concrete facts. Taking the first workshop, which accounts for more than half of the company's output and completed the plan best in the first three quarters, as an example, due to the complacent mood of some workshop cadres, in early October, the finished product rate dropped from 97.01% in September to 96.73% (the target is 97%). Equipment accidents that should not have happened also occurred. After the cadres learned profound lessons from these things, those with complacent mood regained their enthusiasm. They actively sought measures to address the problems in the production of high-grade industrial paper, increasing the speed of photographic base paper from 50 meters per minute to 73 meters, and the quality of the paper also greatly improved. Although they took a small detour in early October, the total output for the whole month still reached 3,200 tons, a leap of 200 tons compared to September. In November, the output of high-grade industrial paper increased by 70%, and the total output of various papers did not decrease, still maintaining the level of October.

The Shanghai Paper Mill is the smallest factory in the Shanghai paper industry, with relatively poor equipment and technology. However, this year's output plan is more than 50% higher than last year. But because this factory's past work was relatively poor and the mass movement was not well developed, it failed to complete the plan in seven months out of the first nine months of this year. In the second and third quarters, the factory's only old boiler had to undergo unplanned major repairs due to its age and insufficient steam, and it did not smoke for more than seventy days, falling far behind the plan. Therefore, the entire factory only completed half of the annual plan within three quarters. Many cadres didn't say it out loud, but they were shaking their heads in their hearts. Some thought that to complete the plan this year, at least 500 tons of paper had to be produced each month in the last three months, and the highest monthly output this year was only over 300 tons. Asking these old machines to produce 500 tons of paper each month would require a miracle. Some people also pinned their hopes for completing the plan on the adjustment of the plan by the superior company in the future. Under the influence of this mood of not being able to complete the plan anyway, technical innovations in the factory were cold and deserted, and when workers made suggestions, the cadres dragged their feet. They didn't urge or ask about the mechanical parts commissioned to outside factories to speed up the machines, leaving them to their own devices.

At the end of September, under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, the factory's Party branch further launched a struggle against right-leaning tendencies and to boost morale, and the cadres exposed their views. When analyzing these thoughts, the Party branch believed that the main reason for this complacent mood among cadres was that they overestimated the difficulties and underestimated the favorable factors. In fact, there were already many favorable conditions at that time: Although the plan was not completed well in the first three quarters, the workers' enthusiasm was still very high, and they all demanded to catch up with the plan. Moreover, at the end of the third quarter, there were already signs of steady progress in production. The old boiler, which was previously considered a weak link, has greatly improved after repairs. The supply of raw materials in the fourth quarter is also more abundant than in any previous quarter. In addition, since changing varieties and producing high-grade industrial paper in August, the technical level of workers has greatly improved, and high-grade industrial paper was produced for the first time on a cylinder machine that was previously considered incapable of producing industrial paper. Based on these circumstances, as long as the leaders are determined and grasp it firmly, 500 tons per month in the fourth quarter is not an unattainable thing.

The result of opposing right-leaning tendencies greatly boosted the confidence of the factory's employees in completing the plan, and a good situation of unprecedented enthusiasm emerged. The cadres, in accordance with the requirements of the annual plan, worked out the progress of the average daily output for three months. The factory director grasped it every day, every shift, and every machine in the workshop. They also increased the speed of the paper machine from more than 60 meters in the third quarter to 95 meters. In October, they won their first major victory this year: paper production exceeded the plan by 11%; quality, output value, cost, profit, and labor productivity also exceeded the plan across the board. In November, they continued their efforts and production exceeded the plan by 22%.

Currently, these two paper mills, one good and one bad in completing the plan, are continuing to advance victoriously. The employees of the China Paper Board Company are striving to increase the output in the fourth quarter from the original 9,000 tons to more than 10,000 tons; the employees of the Shanghai Paper Mill are also full of confidence in completing this year's plan ahead of schedule.

    获胜不骄　知难而进
    上海两个纸厂争取提前完成年计划的经验：条件好的，自始至终坚持到底才能保证持续跃进  条件差的，振作起来抓紧时机计划可以提前完成
    据新华社上海12日电　记者周永康报道：原来能够完成今年计划的工厂怎样有始有终、坚持到底，把计划完成得更好？本来完成今年计划有困难的工厂，如何抓紧时机、力争完成计划？上海两家造纸厂在这方面提供了很好的经验。这两个厂——中国版纸公司和上海造纸厂的情况有力地证明：把右倾反透、把干劲鼓足，是完成今年计划十分重要的保证。
    中国版纸公司设备、技术条件在上海同行中是最好的。今年三个季度就完成了全年计划的70％；产品质量、劳动生产率等技术经济指标，也都比去年提高。一踏进10月份，这个公司的有些干部就流露出这样一种情绪：第四季度根据国家计划，平均每个月只要生产三千吨纸就可以完成全年任务，而公司里9月份的产量已经达到了这个水平，因此今年计划已经十拿十稳，一定可以完成，何必再去多费心机。
    公司党委会发现这种情绪，立即召开会议，在全体干部中进行检查，并且把第四季度的任务摊出来，发动大家讨论。不料，大家越讨论问题越多，问题越多越感到第四季度任务的艰巨。原来，这个季度的产量虽然只有九千吨，但是其中工业用纸数量要比过去多得多；而工业用纸中的高级品种，增加得更多。例如第四季度要大量生产的照相原纸，制造一吨，却要比包装用的版纸多用三倍的时间；另一方面，今年全公司纸机车速普遍加快，有些车间的管理工作还有点跟不上，公司计划虽然完成得不错，但也不是所有车间、所有机台都能完成指标，先进与落后之间的差距还很大，潜力也很大；另外，根据往年的情况，常常在年底以前有紧急的任务要完成，所以也必须作好再加码的准备。这些问题的讨论，使干部们认识到：要完成第四季度任务，确实不是一件轻而易举的事情。
    实际上，这时候干部们也已经通过具体事实看到了松劲情绪的危害性。以产量占到全公司一半以上、前三个季度完成计划最好的第一车间为例，由于一些车间干部存在着自满松劲情绪，10月上旬，成品率从9月份的97.01％降到96.73％（指标是97％）。不应该发生的设备事故也发生了。干部们从这些事情中得到深刻教训以后，有松劲情绪的人干劲重新鼓起。他们针对当前高级工业用纸生产中的问题，积极找措施，把照相原纸的车速从每分钟五十米开到了七十三米，纸张质量也大大提高。10月初虽然走了一点小弯路，但是全月产量仍然达到三千二百吨，比9月份又跃进了两百吨。11月份，高级工业用纸产量增加了70％，而各种纸张的总产量也没有减少，仍然保持了10月份的水平。
    上海造纸厂是上海造纸业中最小的一个工厂，它的设备、技术等都比较差，而今年的产量计划要比去年增长五成以上。但是由于这个厂过去工作比较差，群众运动没有很好开展，今年头九个月中有七个月没有完成计划。在二、三季度，厂里唯一的一台老锅炉因为年老气不足，不得不作计划外的大检修，七十多天没有冒烟，计划拉下一大段。因此，全厂在三个季度之内只完成了全年计划的一半。不少干部嘴上不说，心里都在摇头。有的想，今年要完成计划，后三个月至少每个月要出五百吨纸，而今年最高的月产量也不过三百多吨，叫这些老爷机器每月出五百吨纸，这非要出现奇迹不行。有的人还把完成计划的希望，寄托在将来上级公司的调整计划上。在这种反正完不成计划的情绪支配下，厂里技术革新冷冷清清，工人提了建议，干部们也拖拖拉拉。委托外厂加工的、用来加快车速的机械部件，也不催不问、听之任之。
    9月底，工厂党支部在上级党委领导下，进一步开展了反右倾、鼓干劲的斗争，干部们都暴露了自己的看法。党支部分析这些思想时认为：干部中会有这种松劲情绪，主要是对困难估计过高，对有利因素估计不足。其实当时已经有着很多的有利条件：前三季度虽然计划完成得不好，可是工人情绪仍然很高，都要求把计划抓回来。而且，在三季度末的时候，生产上也已经出现稳步上升的苗头。过去认为是薄弱环节的老锅炉，经过检修以后效果大大提高。四季度原料供应也比过去任何一个季度充足。加上8月份改变品种，生产高级工业纸以后，工人技术水平大大提高，在过去被认为不能造工业纸的圆网机上第一次造出了高级工业纸。根据这些情况，只要领导上下决心，狠狠地抓一下，四季度每个月五百吨并不是达不到的事情。
    反右倾的结果大大地鼓舞了全厂职工完成计划的信心，出现了今年以来从未有过的热气腾腾的大好局面，干部们根据全年计划的要求，排出了三个月平均日产量的进度。厂长在车间里天天抓、班班抓、台台抓。他们还把造纸机的车速从三季度的六十多米提高到九十五米。10月份，他们打了今年以来第一个大胜仗：纸张产量超额11％完成计划；质量、产值、成本、利润、劳动生产率也全面超额完成。11月份再接再厉，产量又超过计划22％。
    目前，这原来完成计划一好一差的两个造纸厂都在继续乘胜前进。中国版纸公司的职工争取第四季度的产量从原来的九千吨提高到一万吨以上；上海造纸厂的职工对于提前完成今年的计划，也充满着信心。
