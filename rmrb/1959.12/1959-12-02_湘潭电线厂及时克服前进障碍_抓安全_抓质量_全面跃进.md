Changsha, December 1st (Reported by this newspaper) - The Xiangtan Wire Factory in Hunan Province, while striving to complete its production plan ahead of schedule, continuously adopts measures to ensure safe production and improve product quality, which has yielded significant results. The factory's labor productivity in October increased by 34% compared to July, and safety accidents decreased by 75%. The quality of all forty-two types of products in the factory continues to improve, and the total output value and cost have completed the annual plan two months ahead of schedule. The annual labor productivity and profit plan, as well as the production plans for ten major products, were also completed ahead of schedule on November 15th.

The factory performed exceptionally well in the first quarter of this year, but in the second quarter, several safety accidents occurred; product quality also began to decline. After discovering this situation, the factory's Party committee immediately analyzed the reasons and subsequently conducted two major debates within the factory. The result of the debates made everyone realize that the greater the leap forward, the more attention should be paid to safe production; the more intense the production, the more necessary it is to prevent accidents; the more important it is to complete the production plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target, the more important it is to attach importance to product quality. The workers established the ideas of "as long as we pay attention to safety, accidents can be completely prevented" and "double leap forward in output and quality." A new atmosphere of "everyone working hard in production, everyone paying attention to safety" has formed in the factory. In about ten days, 2,291 hidden dangers in the factory in terms of electrical appliances, equipment, operation, and materials were identified. The factory leadership immediately mobilized the masses to plug loopholes and eliminate hidden dangers according to their importance and urgency. In a short period of one month, more than 98% of the hidden dangers were eliminated.

The factory is characterized by a large number of new workers. Because they have been in the factory for a short time, they lack sufficient understanding of safe production; also because their technical level is low and their operation is not correct, they are prone to produce defective products. In order to control this aspect well, in addition to strengthening ideological education, the workshops also organized technicians and experienced workers to explain operation techniques and safe production knowledge. The improvement of the technical and ideological level of the new workers has played a significant role in ensuring quality and quantity. In addition, they also conducted examinations on safety knowledge and key points of process operating procedures for all workers in the factory. All employees in the factory passed the standards after three examinations. In order to strengthen the publicity and education on safety and quality, they also adopted forms such as big-character posters, cartoons, and poems. In the past, a few female workers did not wear work caps when working in order to "look good." Then a cartoon appeared on the wall depicting a female worker's braid being caught in a machine, and a quick-rhythm poem was written below. After seeing this picture, the female workers tucked their braids into their hats as soon as they went to work.

The factory also established and improved seven systems, including the handover system, the safety responsibility system, the safety inspection system, the accident reporting system, and the fire protection management system. Safety operating procedures were also established for the original thirty-eight new equipment without operating procedures.

After all the workers in the factory realized the importance of high output and high quality, they adopted a rigorous spirit and followed the process flow, adopting the methods of self-inspection (each semi-finished and finished product is checked by oneself) and mutual inspection (mutual inspection) to strive to improve product quality. Once a problem is found in product quality, everyone actively looks for the reasons and studies improvement measures. For example, in the past, the quality of rubber wire was very poor. The inspectors went to the rubber workshop and worked with the workers to study the problem, and found that the workshop was very unclean, and some dust and sand were wrapped in the rubber wire, so the spark rate was very high. After correction, the spark rate decreased significantly.

### 湘潭电线厂及时克服前进障碍  抓安全  抓质量  全面跃进

    湘潭电线厂及时克服前进障碍
    抓安全  抓质量  全面跃进
    本报长沙1日电　湖南省湘潭电线厂在大抓提前全面完成生产计划的时候，不断采取措施，保证安全生产，保证提高产品质量，已经收到了显著的效果。全厂10月份的劳动生产率比7月增长了34％，安全事故减少了75％；全厂四十二种产品质量不断上升，总产值和成本已提前两个月完成了年计划。全年劳动生产率和利润计划以及十种主要产品的生产计划，也已在11月15日提前完成。
    这个厂今年第一季度的生产任务完成得很出色，可是在第二季度，发生了几件安全事故；产品质量也在开始下降。工厂党委在发现了这一情况后，立即分析了原因，接着又在厂内先后开展了两次大辩论。辩论的结果，使大家认识到：越是大跃进，就越要注意安全生产，生产越是紧张，就越需要注意防止事故；越是要提前超额完成生产计划，就越要重视产品质量。职工们树立了“只要重视安全，事故完全可以防止”和“产量质量双跃进”的思想。全厂形成了一个“人人努力生产，个个重视安全”的新气象。十天左右，就查出了厂内在电器、设备、操作、材料等方面的隐患二千二百九十一处。工厂领导方面立即发动群众，分别轻重缓急，堵塞漏洞，消除隐患。短短一个月的时间，98％以上的隐患就清除了。
    新工人多是这个厂的特点。由于他们进厂时间短，对安全生产缺乏足够的认识；也由于他们的技术水平低，操作不得要领，容易出废品。为了把好这个关口，除加强思想教育外，各车间还组织技术员、老师傅讲解操作技术，讲解安全生产知识。新工人技术水平和思想水平的提高，对保质保量起了很大的作用。此外，他们还对全厂的工人进行了安全知识和工艺操作规程要点的考试，全厂职工经过三次考试都达到了标准。为了加强安全和质量的宣传教育，他们还采用了大字报、漫画和诗歌等形式。过去少数女工为了“好看”，上班时不戴工作帽。于是墙壁上便出现了一幅女工辫子被机器卷住的漫画，下面还写了一首快板诗。女工们看了这幅画以后，一上班就把发辫塞到帽子里去了。
    这个厂还建立和健全了交接班制、安全责任制、安全检查制、事故报告制、消防管理制等七项制度。原来三十八台没有操作规程的新设备，也建立了安全操作规程。
    全厂职工认识到高产必须优质的重要性以后，都以一丝不苟的精神，按工艺流程，采取了自检（每件半成品和成品自己检查）和互检（互相检查）的办法，来努力提高产品质量。一发现产品质量有问题，大家便积极寻找原因和研究改进办法。例如过去橡皮线的质量很差，检验人员便深入到橡皮车间和工人一道研究，发现这个车间很不清洁，一些灰尘、沙子包到橡皮线中去了，因此火花率很高。经过改正，火花率显著下降。
