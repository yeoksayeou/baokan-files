Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: TASS reported on the 28th that Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, spoke at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held on December 25th.

	In his speech, Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union has good conditions to catch up with the United States in per capita meat production by the end of the 1959-1965 Seven-Year Plan. To this end, it is necessary to ensure the production of 20 million to 21 million tons of meat by 1965, instead of the 16 million tons originally planned in the Seven-Year Plan, that is, to strive for an average increase of about 16% per year.

	Khrushchev pointed out, "The development of Soviet agriculture is good, very good."

	This year, 2.845 billion poods of grain were purchased. The average annual grain purchase figure for the past four years is 3 billion poods, while the average figure for the previous four years was only 2 billion poods.

	This year, our country produced 8.6 million tons of meat. In the first eleven months of this year, meat production in collective farms and state farms increased by 32%, and purchases increased by 36%.

	The purchase of cotton was 4.669 million tons. Khrushchev said, "This is more than any year in the entire history of our country's cotton planting industry."

	Khrushchev pointed out that collective farms and state farms account for 83% of the total amount of meat purchased by the state, and 92% of milk. Khrushchev said, "This is a great victory for the socialist agricultural system. The socialist component has become the main and active supplier of meat and milk to cities. Collective farms and state farms guarantee the demand for meat and milk."

	Khrushchev pointed out that in 1959, the Soviet Union had already surpassed the United States in terms of per capita oil production. This year, the Soviet Union's oil production was 845,000 tons, or 4 kilograms per capita. According to estimates by the United States Department of Agriculture, this year's oil production in the United States, including farm production, will be 658,000 tons, or 3.7 kilograms per capita.

	Khrushchev said that further increasing labor productivity is a decisive condition for increasing agricultural production. Khrushchev said, "The issue of increasing labor productivity is the issue of mechanization, the issue of mastering technology, and the issue of being proficient in technology. Therefore, we should pay special attention to this aspect now."

	He then said that in agriculture, at present, we should not only develop in breadth, but also in depth; not only increase the sown area, but also adopt better agronomic techniques to increase yields; and we should strive for higher labor productivity and lower product costs.

	Khrushchev emphasized, "Our path is not an extensive management form based on mainly expanding the sown area, but a highly skilled intensive management, which enables each unit of labor invested per hectare of land to obtain the most products."

	Khrushchev pointed out that there are still many serious shortcomings in agricultural development. He particularly pointed out that Kazakhstan did not complete its tasks well this year, and the most important agricultural work was not done satisfactorily.

	Khrushchev said that Kazakhstan's grain crops grew very well this year, but due to poor work organization, the crops were not all harvested. As of November 1st, 1.618 million hectares of grain in the republic had not been harvested or picked up cleanly.

	Khrushchev pointed out that Kazakhstan caused huge losses to the country due to poor work organization. At the same time, Khrushchev emphasized that Kazakhstan has made considerable achievements, especially in increasing the production and sale of meat to the state.

	The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee emphasized that cultivating more engineers – machine operators – for collective farms and state farms is an urgent task. He said that now is the time to solve this task: to plant crops such as cotton, beets, potatoes, soybeans, and kidney beans without manual labor. This can greatly increase labor productivity and reduce product costs.

	Khrushchev said that the issue of cadres, the correct allocation, training, and proper use of cadres, is the main issue in the entire work of the countryside.

	When talking about labor remuneration in collective farms, Khrushchev said that it should stimulate the increase in agricultural production.

	He said that we should stipulate such a remuneration system in collective farms: there should be no excessive or unreasonable income, but material incentives should be maintained, and the stimulation for collective farmers to further develop public production should not be eliminated. Khrushchev said that with the increase in the degree of mechanization of agricultural production and the improvement of the working level of collective farmers, as well as the improvement of labor organization, it is appropriate to regularly revise and formulate more advanced work quotas and labor remuneration rates in collective farms, just like in industrial enterprises. Khrushchev said that this can ensure the continuous improvement of labor productivity, the growth of accumulation required for the expanded reproduction of the public economy, and the improvement of the material welfare of collective farmers.

	Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union has achieved great development in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan. Industrial production increased by 11.3% in the first eleven months, while the plan stipulated 7.7%. This is a good and encouraging start.

	Khrushchev said that in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, more than a thousand new large-scale enterprises were put into production. Khrushchev said that the plan to further increase the people's welfare is being successfully implemented.

	In the first eleven months of 1959, compared with the same period last year, sales of meat products to residents increased by 20%, dairy products increased by 10%, eggs increased by 9%, and sugar increased by 10%.

	When talking about achievements in agriculture, Khrushchev recalled that in 1953 and 1955, the Party resolutely exposed the shortcomings in the development of agriculture. After the two resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee were made, reactionary newspapers in the United States clamored that the prestige of collective farms had been swept away and that a crisis was occurring in Soviet agriculture, etc. Khrushchev said, "Now, let the Soviet people show them the 'crisis'. And this is just the beginning. Let them get familiar with this."

	He said that we have already surpassed the United States in per capita oil production. Our total milk production is also more than that of the United States. We will soon surpass the United States in meat production.

	Khrushchev continued, "I don't think Americans have the right to complain about us, because our catching up with and surpassing them in the production of animal products will not leave them with any scars or bruises. If our country produces more meat, milk, and oil, then our people will live better."

	Khrushchev said that this Central Plenary Session is a meeting to mobilize agricultural potential. This expanded plenary session is, to some extent, a party congress. A large number of party activists, scientists, collective farm chairmen, and production innovators participated in the plenary session. There are many non-party members who have always worked with the Party. Khrushchev emphasized that our strength lies in the fact that the Party's actions are linked to the actions of the entire people, and non-Party working people work directly and shoulder-to-shoulder with Party members.

	Khrushchev said that in order to summarize the agricultural development work in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan, a special plenary session may be held in December 1960. Khrushchev pointed out that this will be a good promoting factor.

	Khrushchev once again emphasized that the achievements of the Soviet Union are brilliant. He said, "The enemies of socialism are now frustrated by the victories of the Soviet Union. With these victories, we can move towards new achievements with greater confidence. We have reached the peak and achieved high speed. Therefore, it is now easier to switch to higher speeds and seize new peaks in the future."

　　赫鲁晓夫在苏共中央全会上讲话
    苏联七年计划第一年获得辉煌成就
    工业生产头十一个月增长11.3％　农业发展情况非常好
    新华社莫斯科29日电　据塔斯社28日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在12月25日举行的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中强调指出，苏联有良好的条件，在1959—1965年的七年计划结束时，在按人口平均计算的肉类生产方面赶上美国。为此，必须保证到1965年生产二千万吨到二千一百万吨肉类，而不是七年计划原规定的一千六百万吨，即争取每年平均约增加16％。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，“苏联农业发展的情况很好，非常好。”
    今年采购了二十八亿四千五百万普特粮食。最近四年每年粮食采购的平均数字是三十亿普特，而在此以前的四年平均数字只有二十亿普特。
    今年我国生产了八百六十万吨肉类。今年的头十一个月中，集体农庄和国营农场的肉类生产增加了32％，而采购额增加了36％。
    棉花采购了四百六十六万九千吨。赫鲁晓夫说，“这比我国植棉业发展的全部历史中任何一年都要多。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在国家采购的肉类总量中集体农庄和国营农场所占的比重是83％，奶类是92％。赫鲁晓夫说，“这是社会主义农业制度的巨大胜利。社会主义成分已成为供应城市肉类和奶类的主要的、积极的供应者。集体农庄和国营农场保证了对肉类和奶类的需求”。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，1959年苏联在按人口平均计算的油脂产量方面已经超过了美国。今年苏联油脂的产量为八十四万五千吨，即按人口平均计算每人为四公斤。据美国农业部估计，今年美国的油脂产量，包括农场的产额在内，将为六十五万八千吨，即按人口平均计算为三点七公斤。
    赫鲁晓夫说，进一步提高劳动生产率是增加农产品产量的决定性条件。赫鲁晓夫说，“提高劳动生产率的问题，就是机械化的问题，就是掌握技术、精通技术的问题。因此，现在我们应该特别注意这方面”。
    他接着说，在农业方面，目前我们不仅应该向广的方面发展，而且要向深的方面发展，不仅要增加播种面积，而且要采用更好的农艺技术来提高产量，应该争取更高的劳动生产率，降低产品成本。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，“我们的道路，不是以主要扩大播种面积为基础的粗放经营形式，而是高度熟练的集约经营，这种经营使每公顷土地上所付出的每单位劳动获得最多的产品”。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在农业发展方面还有不少严重的缺点。他特别指出，哈萨克今年没有很好地完成任务，最重要的农事工作做得不能令人满意。
    赫鲁晓夫说，哈萨克今年谷物庄稼长得很好，但是由于工作组织得不好，庄稼没有全部收回来。到11月1日为止，共和国中有一百六十一万八千公顷的粮食没有收割或没有拣拾干净。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，由于工作组织得不好，哈萨克使国家遭到了巨大的损失。赫鲁晓夫同时着重指出，哈萨克取得了不少成绩，特别是在增加生产和卖给国家的肉类方面。
    苏共中央第一书记着重说，为集体农庄和国营农场培养更多的工程师——机器操驶者，是一件迫切的工作。他说，现在是时候了，应当解决这一任务：不用手工劳动来种植棉花、甜菜、马铃薯、大豆、菜豆这样一些作物。这样可以大大提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本。
    赫鲁晓夫说，干部问题，干部的正确配备、培养和妥善使用问题，是农村整个工作中的主要问题。
    谈到集体农庄中的劳动报酬时，赫鲁晓夫说，它应当刺激农产品的增产。
    他说，我们应当在集体农庄中规定这样一种报酬制度：没有过高的、不合理的收入，但是物质鼓励应该保持，不要取消对集体农民进一步发展公有生产的刺激。赫鲁晓夫说，随着农业生产机械化程度的提高和集体农民工作水平的提高以及劳动组织的改善，在集体农庄中也像工业企业那样经常修改和制订更先进的工作定额和劳动报酬额，这是适宜的。赫鲁晓夫说，这能保证劳动生产率的不断提高、公有经济扩大再生产所需的积累的增长和集体农民物质福利的增进。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联在七年计划的第一年中就获得了巨大的发展。工业生产在头十一个月中增加了11.3％，而计划规定是7.7％。这是个很好的、令人鼓舞的开端。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在七年计划第一年中就有一千多个新的大型企业投入生产。赫鲁晓夫说，使人民福利进一步增长的计划正在胜利地实现。
    1959年头十一个月与去年同一时期比较，售给居民的肉制品增加了20％，奶制品增加10％，蛋类增加了9％，糖增加了10％。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到农业方面的成就时追述说，在1953年和1955年党坚决地揭露了发展农业方面的缺点，在那两次苏共中央全会作出决议后，美国的反动报纸曾大肆喧嚷，说什么集体农庄的威信扫地了，苏联的农业正在发生危机等等。赫鲁晓夫说：“现在，苏联人民就让他们看看‘危机’。而这不过是开端。让他们熟习熟习这个吧。”
    他说，我们在按人口平均计算的油脂生产方面已经超过了美国。我们奶类的总产量也比美国多。我们在肉类生产方面很快就将超过美国。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说：“我想，美国人没有权利抱怨我们，因为我们在畜产品生产方面赶过和超越他们，并不会给他们留下任何伤痕和青斑。如果我国生产更多的肉类、奶类和油脂，那么我国人民将生活得更加美好”。
    赫鲁晓夫说，这次中央全体会议是一次动员农业潜力的会议。这次全会扩大会议在某种程度上来说是一次党的代表会议。参加全会的有大批党的积极分子、科学家、集体农庄主席和生产革新者。这里有许多一向同党在一起工作的非党人士。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，我们的力量在于，党的行动同全体人民的行动是联结在一起的，非党劳动人民直接地、肩并肩地同党员在一起工作着。
    赫鲁晓夫说，为了总结七年计划第二年的农业发展工作，可能将在1960年12月举行一次特别全体会议。赫鲁晓夫指出，这将是一个很好的促进因素。
    赫鲁晓夫再一次强调说，苏联取得的成就是辉煌的。他说：“社会主义的敌人现在由于苏联的胜利而感到沮丧。我们有了这些胜利就可以更有信心地向着新成就迈进。我们已登上了高峰并且取得了高速度。所以，现在已比较容易在今后转到更高的速度和夺取新的高峰”。
