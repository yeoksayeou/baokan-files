Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, New York: The fourteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly closed this morning. At the Assembly's December 12th meeting, the Algerian question and the peaceful uses of outer space were discussed, and Poland was elected to replace Japan as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.

    Obstructed by Western colonial powers, the Assembly was unable to pass any resolution on the Algerian question.

    The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed a proposal put forward by twenty-two Asian-African countries on this issue a few days ago with a majority vote. However, the number of votes obtained by the Asian-African proposal did not reach the two-thirds majority required to pass a proposal in the plenary session of the Assembly. Later, the Pakistani delegation put forward a more moderate compromise proposal than the Asian-African proposal. This proposal expressed deep concern about the continuing war in Algeria, recognized the Algerian people's right to self-determination, and demanded preliminary negotiations in order to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue on the basis of self-determination and in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

    However, Western colonial countries opposed the United Nations General Assembly passing any resolution on the Algerian question. British representative Dixon stated in the debate that he did not believe that the United Nations had the right to recognize the Algerian people's right to self-determination under the Charter. The Pakistani proposal received thirty-nine votes in favor during the vote (socialist countries and most Asian-African countries), but because twenty-two delegations, including the United Kingdom, opposed it, the Pakistani proposal did not receive a two-thirds majority and therefore was not passed. The United States abstained during the vote. The Asian-African twenty-two-nation proposal passed in the Political Committee was not put to a vote in the General Assembly.

    Subsequently, the Assembly unanimously adopted the Political Committee's resolution on the peaceful uses of outer space, which included an amendment by Belgium.

    Soviet delegation leader Kuznetzov reiterated in his speech his opposition to the Belgian clause that restricts the countries participating in the international conference on the peaceful uses of outer space. Kuznetzov said that the Soviet Union advocates that this international conference should allow all countries willing to participate to do so. Kuznetzov stated that the Soviet Union will continue to work to ensure that all relevant countries can participate in this international conference.

    The Assembly then held elections to fill the Security Council's non-permanent seat vacated by Japan. As everyone knows, due to the Western countries' discrimination against Eastern European socialist countries, they have repeatedly manipulated the Assembly, violating the principle of regional distribution, and forcibly occupying Security Council non-permanent seats that should have been allocated to the Eastern European region by countries outside the Eastern European region. This year, the Eastern European region proposed that Poland replace Japan, whose term expires at the end of this year, as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, but the United States supported Turkey. Therefore, the question of who would replace Japan has been voted on fifty-one times in the United Nations General Assembly without result.

    On the eve of the closing of the Assembly, the countries concerned reached an agreement on this issue. According to this agreement, Poland is the only candidate for the Security Council's non-permanent seat. After the election, Poland will serve as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 1959, and Turkey will be elected at the fifteenth session. Soviet representative Kuznetzov pointed out in response that the Soviet delegation believes that this solution is a temporary measure under the current circumstances. It believes it is necessary to emphasize that this does not mean that the Soviet Union's position on the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council has changed in any way. Kuznetzov said that the Soviet delegation will continue to work to eliminate discrimination against Eastern European countries in the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council in the future. Otherwise, it would violate past agreements and the principle that the seats of non-permanent members of the Security Council should be distributed equally by region.

    After the speech by the President of the General Assembly, Peruvian representative Belaunde, the head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetzov, spoke, summarizing the situation of this session.

    After other representatives spoke, the President of the Assembly declared the meeting closed.

    联大十四届会议闭幕
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会第十四届会议今天清晨闭幕。在大会12日会议上讨论了阿尔及利亚问题和和平利用外层空间问题，并且选出波兰接替日本为安全理事会非常任理事国。
    在西方殖民国家阻挠下，大会没有能就阿尔及利亚问题通过任何决议。
    联合国大会政治委员会前几天以多数票通过了二十二个亚非国家关于这一问题的提案。但是，亚非国家提案所得票数没有达到在大会全体会议上通过提案所需要的三分之二多数，后来巴基斯坦代表团提出了一项比亚非国家提案更为温和的折衷提案。这个提案表示对在阿尔及利亚继续进行的战争深为关心，表示承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权和要求举行预备性谈判，以便在自决权的基础上和根据联合国宪章的原则来和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    但是，西方殖民国家反对联合国大会通过任何关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议。英国代表迪克逊在辩论中表示，他不认为联合国根据宪章有权承认阿尔及利亚人民有自决权。巴基斯坦提案在表决时得到三十九票赞成票（社会主义国家和大部分亚非国家），但是，由于英国等二十二个代表团反对，巴基斯坦提案没有得到三分之二多数，因此没有被通过。美国在表决时弃权。在政委会上通过的亚非二十二国关于这个问题的提案没有在大会上表决。
    接着，大会一致通过了政治委员会关于和平利用外层空间的决议，其中包括比利时的修正条款。
    苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫在发言中再次表示反对比利时提出的对参加和平利用外层空间国际会议的国家，加以限制的条款。库兹?佐夫说，苏联主张这次国际会议应允许一切愿意参加的国家参加。库兹?佐夫表示，苏联将继续努力，使所有有关国家都能参加这次国际会议。
    大会接着举行了接替日本的安理会非常任理事国席位的选举，大家知道，由于西方国家歧视东欧社会主义国家，它们多次操纵大会，违反地区分配原则，硬使一些非东欧地区国家占据本来应该分配给东欧地区的安理会非常任理事国席位，今年，东欧地区国家提出波兰接替今年年底任期届满的日本为安理会非常任理事国，但是美国却支持土耳其，因此，谁接替日本的问题在联合国大会上虽然进行了五十一次投票，一直没有结果。
    在大会闭幕前夕，有关国家就这一问题达成了协议，根据这项协议，波兰是安理会非常任理事国的唯一候选人。经过选举，波兰将在1959年担任安理会非常任理事国，而在第十五届会议上则将选举土耳其。苏联代表库兹?佐夫针对这一点指出，苏联代表团认为，这样解决问题是当前情况下的临时办法。它认为有必要强调指出，这决不意味着苏联在选举安理会非常任理事国这个问题上的立场有任何改变。库兹?佐夫说，苏联代表团今后也要努力消除在选举安理会非常任理事国时歧视东欧国家的情况。否则，就会违背过去达成的协议，就会违背是安理会非常任理事国席位按地区平等分配的原则。
    在联大主席、秘鲁代表贝朗德讲话后，苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫发言，总结了这届会议的情况。
    其他代表发言后，大会主席宣布会议闭幕。
