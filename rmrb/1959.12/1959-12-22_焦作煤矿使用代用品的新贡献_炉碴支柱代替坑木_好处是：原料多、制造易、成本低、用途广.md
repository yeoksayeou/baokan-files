Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 21st: Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan Province has recently successfully trial-produced slag pillars, opening up a new avenue for saving pit props by using substitutes.

The slag pillar is made of coal combustion residue, lime, gypsum, and bamboo reinforcement. Its production method is very simple. First, grind the raw materials into powder using a grinder, mix with water, then pour into a wooden mold, add bamboo reinforcement, and tamp it firmly. After regular steam curing and cooling demolding, it becomes a mine pillar as strong as concrete.

The biggest advantages of this pillar are: First, abundant raw materials. Various industrial production units discard a lot of slag every day, which is an inexhaustible source. Jiaozuo Coal Mine and the local power plant produce more than 200 tons of slag every day, which can be used to make more than 2,000 slag pillars. Second, low cost and convenient to use. Compared with pit props of the same specifications, the cost of each slag pillar is reduced by half. When used on the coal mining face, it does not need to be recycled and reused, thereby simplifying the operation procedures. Third, wide range of uses. It can not only replace wooden sheds in roadways, but also be used on the coal mining face where pit props are most consumed.

During the trial of slag pillars, leading cadres of the Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee and the Mining Bureau, together with the workers, jointly studied and solved various difficulties encountered. Engineering and technical personnel and workers also achieved close cooperation. The workers promptly provided problems in operation to the technical personnel for research, and the technical personnel, based on the workers' opinions, referred to technical data and personally went down the well to conduct experiments with the workers, thus enabling the slag pillars to be successfully tested.

The successful trial of slag pillars can save a lot of wood for the country and provide more favorable conditions for the great leap forward in the coal industry. Therefore, the Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee has designated the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau to produce this type of slag pillars in large quantities. At present, the employees of the Mining Bureau are continuing to work hard to further improve the performance of slag pillars.

　　焦作煤矿使用代用品的新贡献
    炉碴支柱代替坑木
    好处是：原料多、制造易、成本低、用途广
    新华社郑州21日电　河南焦作煤矿职工最近试制成功炉碴支柱，为使用代用品节约坑木开辟了一条新途径。
    炉碴支柱，是用煤炭燃烧后的残碴和石灰、石膏、竹筋制成的，它的制作方法很简便。先把几种原料用研磨机研成粉末，加水拌和，然后灌进木模中，配以竹筋捣实，再经过蒸汽定期养护、冷却脱模，便成了同混凝土一样坚固的矿井支柱。
    这种支柱的最大好处是：第一，原料丰富。各工业生产单位每天都要倒掉不少的炉碴，这是取之不尽、用之不竭的源泉。焦作煤矿和当地发电厂每天出的炉碴有二百多吨，可以制作两千多根炉碴支柱。第二，成本低，使用便利。这种支柱跟同等规格的坑木比较，每根成本降低二分之一；在回采工作面使用的时候，不必回收和复用，从而简化了操作程序。第三，用途广泛。它不但可以在巷道中代替木棚，还可以在消耗坑木最多的回采工作面上使用。
    在试验炉碴支柱的过程中，中共焦作市委和矿务局的领导干部同职工们一道，共同研究解决了所碰到的各种困难问题。工程技术人员和工人，也做到了亲密合作。工人把操作中的问题及时提供给技术人员研究，技术人员根据工人的意见参考技术资料，亲自下井同工人一块搞试验，因而使炉碴支柱顺利试验成功。
    炉碴支柱的试验成功，能为国家节省大量木材，为煤炭工业实现大跃进提供了更有利的条件。因此，中共焦作市委已经指定焦作矿务局大量生产这种炉碴支柱。目前，矿务局的职工们正在继续努力进一步提高炉碴支柱的使用性能。
