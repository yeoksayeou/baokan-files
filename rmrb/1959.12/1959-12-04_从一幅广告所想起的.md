    Thoughts Evoked by an Advertisement
    Zhou Wang
    A few days ago, when I read an advertisement in the "People's Daily," my eyes suddenly lit up, and my mood was greatly excited. The advertisement was very ordinary: Under the factory name of "Chongming First Iron and Steel Machinery Factory" in Song No. 2 font were performance introductions and diagrams of four types of agricultural machinery products.
    The reason I was excited was because I saw the tremendous changes in my hometown during the Great Leap Forward. Chongming is my hometown. This is a small island surrounded by water at the mouth of the Yangtze River. For hundreds of years since its existence, the residents of the island have lived by farming, living a poor life. Before liberation, there were only two textile factories, which were already on their last legs at the time of liberation. The island does not produce coal or iron, and no one ever dreamed of establishing any iron and steel machinery industry.
    When the Great Leap Forward began last year, I learned a little about the changes in my hometown from some letters my family sent me: People's communes were established, small blast furnaces were built in the county seat… However, I didn't know that the backward rural area where I spent my childhood had actually developed a modern iron and steel machinery industry today.
    Now, through the newspaper and advertisement in front of me, I have seen that near the former ancient city, red chimneys soaring into the clouds have been erected, with the words "Chongming First Iron and Steel Machinery Factory" boldly written by the heroic workers of my hometown, and agricultural machines are rolling off the production line one after another... The people of my hometown wielded the words "First" with a grand stroke, implying that we will have a second, a third...
    Just this small advertisement gives a powerful rebuff to the right-leaning opportunists. Small iron and steel plants like the one in my hometown are constantly growing all over the country, which shows that the "small foreign groups" have their strong vitality.

    从一幅广告所想起的
    周望
    前几天，我读到“人民日报”的一幅广告时，双眼为之忽然一亮，心情也随着大大激动起来了。广告是很普通的：二号宋体字排的“崇明第一钢铁机械厂”的厂名下就是四种农业机器产品的性能介绍和图样。
    我之所以激动，是因为在这里看到了故乡在大跃进中的巨变。崇明是我的故乡。这是一个在长江口的四面环水的小岛，自从有它的历史以来的数百年中，岛上的居民都是务农为生，过着贫苦的生活。解放前只有过两家纺织工厂，解放时已经奄奄一息。岛上不产煤铁，谁也没有梦想过会建立什么钢铁机械工业。
    去年大跃进开始的时候，我从家人寄给我的一些信里，也稍微知道了故乡变化的一鳞半爪：人民公社建立起来了，县城里办了小高炉，……然而我还不知道，我在那里度过了童年时代的落后的农村，今天居然发展了现代化的钢铁机械工业。
    现在透过摆在我面前的报纸和广告，我已经看到了在那从前是古城的近旁，耸立起了红色的高入云霄的烟囱，烟囱上有着故乡的英雄工人大书特书的字眼：“崇明第一钢铁机械厂”，而一架架农业机器也正在鱼贯出厂……。故乡的人民用大笔挥出了“第一”两个字，笔下之意是我们还将有第二、第三……。
    就这末一幅小小的广告，又给了右倾机会主义分子一个有力的回击。像我故乡这样的小型钢铁厂，正在全国各地不断成长，它说明“小洋群”，是有它的强大生命力的。
