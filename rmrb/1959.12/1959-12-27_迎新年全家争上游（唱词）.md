The sun sets in the west, and the sky darkens,
Smoke rises from the public canteen.
Old Man Zhang carries his manure basket home,
Smiling all the way, his heart is full of joy.
The road is covered with donkey droppings,
He picks them up one by one, not afraid of a sore back.
Party Secretary Li once said,
We must strive for a harvest next year that surpasses this year.
Water conservancy and manure accumulation are two major tasks,
If these two things are done well, a bumper harvest is not difficult.
As for water conservancy? I'm a little old,
But I can take on the task of accumulating manure.
Carrying a manure basket, picking up manure,
Accumulating little by little can fertilize the fields.
The villagers all praise Old Man Zhang,
Saying that he is old but ambitious, like a young man.
The manure basket is heavy on his back,
He stops to rest by the roadside to catch his breath.
He looks up and sees,
A postman walking towards him. (White): Grandpa Zhang, this is your letter.
He pulls a letter from his mailbag,
The big black characters on the envelope are written neatly.
Old Man Zhang's face is full of smiles as he takes the letter,
Thanking the postman again and again:
Old Li, go to the canteen for dinner soon,
Stop by my house for a smoke later. (White): No, I'll come to visit you in a couple of days.
It's getting late, I have to hurry on my way,
I'd be worried if I delayed other people's letters.
The postman hastily says goodbye,
And Old Man Zhang carries his manure basket back to his doorstep.
He washes his face, eats dinner at the canteen,
Drinks tea, and smokes two bags of tobacco,
His eyes fixed on the outside of the door,
But he doesn't see his wife return.
He waits and thinks,
Waiting and waiting, he becomes impatient. (White): Xiao Chun, go to the pig farm and see your mother—
Just as he's saying that, a figure flashes nearby,
And Aunt Zhang arrives at the door excitedly.
Old Man Zhang says, "Oh, my old partner,
I've been waiting for you until my eyes are sore.
Da Chun has sent a letter from the factory,
We're waiting for you to read it together."...
Aunt Zhang says, "The meeting ended late today,
The things we discussed are not simple,
Next year, pig farming will be greatly developed,
Not just doubled, but quadrupled.
We need to prepare coarse and fine fodder,
And build a large number of pigsties...
What did Da Chun write in his letter?
Tell Xiao Chun to read it."
Old Man Zhang strikes a match and lights the lamp,
The whole family sits around the table.
Xiao Chun reads the letter aloud,
The old couple listens quietly, their faces beaming.
This letter is so affectionate,
First, he sends greetings to his parents,
Saying that the New Year is coming soon,
Wishing his parents a happy New Year.
Then he asks about his little brother,
Asking if he is being naughty.
Reading this, Xiao Chun puts on a stern face:
Brother's words are not reasonable,
Looking at people through a crack in the door makes you see them in a biased way,
I am a model Young Pioneer....(White): Aunt Zhang says, "Your brother is concerned about you. Read on!"
In the factory these days, red flags are flying,
Good news is reported every day,
We completed this year's production half a month ahead of schedule,
And everyone is striving to prepare for next year.
Each workshop is repairing and inspecting machines,
Preparing tools and materials completely.
To create conditions for a good start to next year,
Preparing this good gift to welcome the New Year.
A few days ago, the factory held a model worker competition,
Your son didn't fall behind and was among the top.
From now on, I must be more humble and work hard,
Studying technology and inventing things diligently.
I am determined to contribute more to the country,
Dad and Mom will surely be happy to hear this....
After hearing the letter, the old couple's faces are full of smiles,
Praising their good son for his extraordinary ambition.
If young people can all do this,
We two are sure not to fall behind!
Tell Xiao Chun to quickly take out paper, ink, and brush,
And write a letter to your brother to challenge him. (White): Xiao Chun, write like this:
Son's letter is well written, with no lack of ambition,
Your parents read the letter and are happy in their hearts.
The factory is full of joy in welcoming the New Year,
In the countryside, the enthusiasm is equally great,
In order to strive for a bumper harvest next year,
Everyone is busy with water conservancy and manure accumulation.
Your mother takes care of the pigs at the pig farm,
Finding fodder, feeding the pigs, and diligently cleaning the pigsties,
Cooking the fodder evenly and thoroughly,
The piglets grow big and round.
Your mother's work is good, and everyone praises her,
She was chosen as a model worker at the pig farm and won first place.
Not complacent, she has new plans,
To double the number of piglets bred next year...
Your father is not as capable as your mother,
But he wants to spur on his horse and strive for the top. (White): Old Man says, "You old woman, you are really not modest!"
He gets up before dawn to collect manure,
Going back and forth on the roads and roadsides,
He has accumulated dozens of loads of manure so far,
And he plans to multiply this several times next year.
We two are challenging you today,
Next year, let's see who is behind and who is ahead!...
Zhang Xiao Chun stops writing here,
Mom, I'll write a few sentences above.
(White): Go ahead and write.
Although I, Xiao Chun, am only ten and a half years old,
It is only natural to strive for the top and not fall behind,
Study hard, work hard, and exercise more,
Help my mother with housework and not be afraid of trouble,
Pick up manure by the roadside in my free time,
And also clean the pigsties at the livestock farm....
A letter is written, neither long nor short,
Three sheets of paper are filled,
Read it from beginning to end,
The faces of the old and young are all smiling.
This is truly a good family, everyone is a model,
Striving to be advanced and welcoming the New Year!

　　迎新年全家争上游（唱词）
　　易和元
    日落西山天色晚，
    公共食堂冒炊烟，
    张老汉背着粪筐回家转，
    一路走一路笑心里喜欢。
    大路上到处都是驴粪蛋，
    见一个捡一个不怕腰酸。
    党委李书记曾把话谈，
    要争取明年丰收胜过今年。
    修水利和积肥大事两件，
    两件事做好了丰收不难。
    修水利么？我年纪大了一点，
    说积肥我老汉倒能承担。
    背起粪筐把粪捡，
    积少成多能肥田。
    社员们都把我老汉称赞，
    说我是年老志高像个青年。
    背上粪筐沉甸甸，
    他喘口气儿休息在路边。
    抬起头来用目看，
    迎面走来邮递员。（白）：张大爷，这是你的信。
    从邮袋里抽出信一件，
    信封上黑黑的大字写的端。
    张老汉接信笑满面，
    声声感谢邮递员：
    老李呀，快到食堂去吃饭，
    停会儿请到我家抽袋烟。（白）：不用了，等两天再来拜望你老人家。
    天色不早我要把路赶，
    耽误别人信件我心不安。
    邮递员匆匆道再见，
    张老汉也背着粪筐回到屋前。
    洗了脸，他到食堂吃过饭，
    喝了茶，他又抽了两袋烟，
    两只眼直盯着门外看，
    却不见老伴转回还。
    他一边在等一边在念，
    一等二等他就不耐烦，（白）：小春呀，你到养猪场看看你妈——
      正说着近处人影闪，
    张大妈兴冲冲来到门前。
    张老汉说：“哎呀，我的老伙伴，
    等你回来眼睛都望穿。
    大春儿从厂里来了信，
    就等你来一同把信看。”……
    大妈说：“今天开会回来晚，
    讨论的事儿可不简单，
    明年养猪要大发展，
    一番不够翻两番。
    粗细饲料要准备，
    还要大量修猪圈。……
    大春儿写信说些啥？
    快叫小春念一念。”
    张老汉擦根火柴把灯点，
    一家人围坐在桌前。
    小春朗朗把信读，
    老两口一旁静听笑开颜。
    这封信写得真亲切，
    先向爹妈来问安，
    说是新年快要到，
    祝福爹妈新年过得欢。
    接着又把小弟问，
    问他贪玩不贪玩。
    读到这里小春板起脸：
    哥哥说话理不端，
    门缝里看人把人都看扁，
    我是一个模范少先队员。……（白）：大妈说：“你哥是在关心你。往下念吧”！
    工厂里这一阵红旗招展，
    喜报天天都在传，
    提前半月完成了今年生产，
    为明年作准备个个争先。
    各车间都在把机器修检，
    把工具和材料准备齐全。
    为明年开门红创造条件，
    备下这好礼物迎接新年。
    工厂里前几天评比模范，
    你的儿不落后名列上边。
    从今后我更要虚心实干，
    学技术搞发明苦苦钻研。
    为国家多出力儿立志愿，
    爹和妈听了这定也喜欢。……
    听完信老两口春风满面，
    赞一声好儿子志气不凡。
    年青人都能这样干，
    我两口未必然落在后边！
    叫小春快取出信纸笔砚，
    给你哥写封信挑战一番。（白）：小春，你这样写：
    儿的信写得好志气不短，
    你爹妈读了信喜在心间。
    工厂里迎新年喜气一片，
    在农村红火劲也不一般，
    为了争取明年大丰产，
    修水利积肥料个个不闲。
    你的妈养猪场把猪照看，
    找饲料喂猪食勤扫猪圈，
    把饲料煮得来又匀又烂，
    猪儿们长得来又大又圆。
    你的妈工作好人人称赞，
    养猪场选模范中了状元。
    不自满她又有新的打算，
    要明年猪仔繁殖加两番……
    你的爹虽不及你妈能干，
    争上游他也要快马加鞭。（白）：老汉说：“你这个老婆子真不谦虚”！
    天不亮就起床把粪来捡，
    在大道和路边来回转圈，
    到现在他已积肥几十担，
    在明年他计划要翻几番。
    我二人今天和你来挑战，
    在明年比一比谁后谁先？……
    张小春写到这里停了笔杆，
    妈呀，我也写它几句在上边。
  （白）：你就写嘛。
    我小春虽只十岁半，
    争上游不落后理所当然，
    勤学习勤劳动多把身体锻炼，
    帮妈妈搞家务不怕麻烦，
    有空时路边把粪捡，
    还要到畜牧场打扫猪圈。……
    一封信写得来不长不短，
    三张信纸都写完，
    从头到尾念一遍，
    老小三人脸笑圆。
    这真是好家庭个个是模范，
    力争上游迎新年！
