According to Yunnan Daily, the workers of Yunnan Printing and Dyeing Factory, in innovating the cloth boiling method, achieved victory in a tortuous struggle with the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act combined with scientific analysis, under the enthusiastic support of the leadership, and created the advanced "Cyclic Continuous Boiler Cloth Boiling Method."

The "Cyclic Continuous Boiler Cloth Boiling Method" began to be tested in October. At that time, after the third quarter's leap forward in the factory's production, difficulties arose as the equipment capacity could not meet the needs of production. In particular, the cloth boiling equipment and insufficient steam seriously affected the continued leap forward. At this time, a vigorous mass movement of technical innovation was launched throughout the factory. To break through this weak link, the Party branch secretary of the bleaching and dyeing workshop, together with the workers, racked their brains to find a solution. They carefully studied the characteristics of the "Continuous Boiler Cloth Boiling Method" of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Factory. After repeated consideration, they boldly proposed experimenting with the "Cyclic Continuous Boiler Cloth Boiling Method": The steam and caustic soda used to boil the cloth in the first pot would not be released, but pumped into the second pot, and after being used in the second pot, it would be pumped back into the first pot, constantly recycled. Implementing this method could save a lot of steam and shorten the boiling time. This suggestion was immediately supported by the workers and the factory leaders.

However, after the suggestion was made, a few people were afraid that when the steam was directly pumped from one boiling pot to another, the high air pressure would cause the steam pipe to explode when it met cold air, that the boiling pot would be overturned, that the cloth ends would be disrupted, etc. They said, "This is unprecedented in the national printing and dyeing industry. Our equipment here is poor, it would be dangerous to do it. Let's wait until we have better equipment!" The factory director mobilized everyone to combine the courage to think and act with scientific analysis and boldly innovate. According to the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, everyone conducted many studies and confirmed that the fear of the steam pipe exploding when it met cold air, the fear of the pot being overturned, and the cloth being disrupted were all based on insufficient evidence. Because when the steam is pumped from one boiling pot to another, the pressure in the pipeline is only about thirty pounds, while the pressure in the boiler room pipes is as high as one hundred pounds, and there have been no explosions despite frequent exposure to cold air. At the same time, there are more than three tons of cloth in the pot, plus the weight of the pot itself, which is three tons. A pressure of thirty pounds would not overturn it, and the cloth would not be disrupted. After analysis, the masses became more determined about the experiment.

In the midst of the tense experiment, due to lack of experience, some of the alkali was released when checking whether the alkali was being successfully extracted, and the alkali level dropped as seen on the meter. At this time, a few people began to waver about the experiment, saying, "If there is less alkali, the whole pot of cloth will become brittle. We should quickly release steam and add alkali." The factory director, the Party branch secretary of the workshop, and the workers and technicians immediately conducted research. After analysis, it was believed that the steam had a lot of moisture and the cloth was wet. Although there was a little less alkali, the cloth would not become brittle. If steam was released and alkali was added, the experiment would be wasted. The employees firmly continued the experiment, and the cloth not only did not become brittle, but the quality was better than before. The experiment was finally successful.

The "Cyclic Continuous Boiler Cloth Boiling Method" was officially applied to production in early November. After implementing this method, not only was good cloth boiled safely, but also 67.7% of steam was saved per pot compared to the past, and work efficiency increased by about 50%.

    在科学分析的基础上大胆革新
    云南印染厂经过一场曲折斗争创造新煮布法
    节约蒸气百分之六十七以上提高工效百分之五十左右
    据云南日报消息　云南印染厂职工在革新煮布法时，经过一场曲折的斗争，在领导的热情支持下，敢想敢干与科学分析的革命精神取得了胜利，创造了先进的“循环连锅煮布法”。
    “循环连锅煮布法”是10月份开始试验的。当时全厂生产经过第三季度的跃进后，出现了设备能力不能适应生产需要的困难，其中特别是煮布设备和蒸气不足，严重地影响着继续跃进。这时，全厂开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革新的群众运动。为突破这个薄弱环节，漂染整车间的党支部书记，和工人一起动脑筋想办法。他们细心地研究了上海印染厂“连锅煮布法”的特点，经过反复思索，大胆地提出试验“循环连锅煮布法”：把在第一锅煮过布的蒸气和烧碱不放掉，用水泵打入第二锅，第二锅用后再打入第一锅，不断地循环利用。实行这个办法可以节约大量蒸气和缩短煮布时间。这个建议一经提出，立即得到工人们的拥护和工厂领导人员的支持。
    但是，建议提出以后，有少数人怕蒸气从一个煮布锅直接打入另一个煮布锅时，高气压遇冷会引起蒸气管爆炸，会把煮布锅冲翻，会把布头冲乱等。他们说：“这是全国印染界还没有过的事，我们这里设备差，搞起来危险，等有了好设备再说吧！”厂长动员大家把敢想敢干和科学分析结合起来，大胆革新。大家根据实事求是的科学分析精神，进行了多次研究，证实怕蒸气管遇冷爆炸、怕锅被冲翻、布被冲乱的说法都是根据不足的。因为蒸气从一个煮布锅打入另一个煮布锅时，管道的气压只有三十磅左右，而厂里锅炉间的管道气压高达一百磅，经常遇冷也没有爆炸。同时，锅里有三吨多重的布，加上锅本身的重量三吨，三十磅的气压是冲不翻的，布也不会给冲乱。经过分析，广大群众对试验更加坚定了。
    在紧张的试验当中，由于缺乏经验，在检查碱是否顺利被吸出的时候，放掉了一部分碱，从仪表上看出，碱位有了下降。这时又有少数人对试验动摇起来，说：“碱少了全锅布会发脆，应该赶快放蒸气，加碱。”厂长、车间党支部书记和工人、技术人员立即进行研究。经过分析，认为蒸气有很大的水分，布是潮的，碱虽然少了些，布也不会发脆。如果放蒸气、加碱，试验就白搞了。职工们坚定地进行试验，布不仅没有发脆，质量比过去还好。试验终于成功了。
    “循环连锅煮布法”在11月上旬正式应用于生产。实行这个办法以后，不仅安全地煮出了好布，而且每煮一锅比过去节约蒸气67.7％，工效提高了50％左右。
