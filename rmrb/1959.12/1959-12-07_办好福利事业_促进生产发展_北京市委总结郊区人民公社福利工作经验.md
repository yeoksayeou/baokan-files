Xinhua News Agency, December 6th – The Beijing Municipal Party Committee held a suburban People's Commune welfare work conference from December 2nd to 4th to summarize the experiences of communes in running collective welfare programs well.

Currently, the suburbs of Beijing have established more than 10,800 public canteens, with farmers eating in canteens accounting for 83.5% of the total households. More than 21,600 childcare organizations have been set up, taking care of more than 275,000 children. There are also many homes for the elderly, medical institutions, maternity hospitals, and sewing groups. These collective welfare programs have played a significant role in ensuring the lives of commune members, fully exploiting labor potential, and especially liberating women's labor. More than 250,000 rural women in the suburbs have been freed from housework and have participated in production. Before communization, only 54% of women in the Zhoukoudian District participated in productive labor. After the people's communes universally established canteens and nurseries, the attendance rate of women's labor increased to 97%. The development of collective welfare programs in the communes has also given the vast number of commune members time to study politics, technology, and culture, and to carry out recreational activities. Last year, more than 320,000 commune members in the suburbs participated in cultural studies, about half of whom were women.

Based on practice over the past year, the conference summarized the experiences of communes in running collective welfare programs well. The conference believes that to run the welfare programs of the People's Commune well, it is first necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and implement putting politics in command. It is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of "actively running well, voluntary participation," fully mobilize the masses, and conduct extensive airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters among the vast number of commune members through the method of stating facts and reasoning, to clarify right and wrong, and unify understanding. Secondly, it is necessary to implement democratic management and follow the mass line. Each canteen should establish a democratically elected food management committee to regularly study the work of the canteen and frequently solicit the opinions of commune members to improve the food; the establishment of childcare groups and kindergartens must also implement the principle of democratic management, for the convenience of production and parents.

The conference pointed out that to run the collective welfare programs of the commune well, it is also necessary to practice thrift and careful calculation. Many public canteens in the suburbs have implemented a whole set of methods such as "rationing grain according to the number of people, distributing grain to households, bringing rations to the canteen, issuing meal tickets according to the ration and supply standards, eating with tickets, and saving money and grain for individuals," and have accordingly established a set of management systems. They have achieved careful use of grain, calculating before eating, adjusting between busy and slack seasons, and eating both thin and dry foods, creating good food management methods that save grain and are delicious. At the same time, vigorously carry out kitchenware reform to reduce physical labor and improve work efficiency. These experiences are worth adhering to and promoting. The conference pointed out that in order to run collective welfare programs such as canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, and sewing groups well, a certain number of Party and League members should be assigned as backbone forces. The cooks and management personnel of the canteen should be elected by the masses and be served by people who have good backgrounds, good ideology, are fair in handling affairs, and have a kind attitude.

The conference believes that establishing and improving the financial system is also one of the important conditions for running the collective welfare programs of the commune well. Some canteens have established a financial management system over the past year, cleaned up and rectified accounts, trained accounting personnel, and promoted planned management and economic accounting, calculating profits and losses on a monthly basis and announcing them to the masses for review. This has ensured the continuous consolidation and development of the canteen. Childcare organizations and homes for the elderly should also have a sound management system.

More than 1,400 cadres from 13 districts (counties), communes, management areas, and production teams in the suburbs, as well as management and service personnel from canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly, participated in the conference. Chen Peng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, made a report at the meeting. He requested that Party committees at all levels comprehensively grasp ideology, production, and life. While vigorously consolidating collective welfare programs, it is necessary to first run public canteens well, because they are the center of collective welfare programs. Secondly, it is necessary to run nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and sewing organizations well. At the same time, in conjunction with production, mobilize the masses to carry out the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, and further develop rural medical and health services. At present, it is necessary to properly solve the problem of winter heating for commune members, and in conjunction with production, carry out mass amateur cultural activities so that the vast number of commune members can have both work and rest, and fully devote themselves to the great production movement this winter and next spring.

    办好福利事业　促进生产发展
    北京市委总结郊区人民公社福利工作经验
    新华社6日讯　中共北京市委2日到4日召开郊区人民公社福利工作会议，总结了公社办好集体福利事业的经验。
    目前北京市郊区已办起一万零八百多个公共食堂，入食堂的农户占总户数的83.5％；办起托儿组织二万一千六百多个，收托幼儿二十七万五千多人；还有许多敬老院、医疗机构、妇产院和缝纫组等。这些集体福利事业，在保障社员生活、充分发挥劳动潜力、特别是解放妇女劳动力等方面起了巨大的作用。全郊区有二十五万多农村妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加了生产。周口店区在公社化以前只有54％的妇女劳力参加生产劳动，人民公社普遍办起食堂和托儿所以后，妇女劳力的出勤率提高到97％。公社集体福利事业的发展，还使广大社员有时间学习政治、技术、文化和开展娱乐活动。去年全郊区有三十二万多名社员参加了文化学习，其中妇女就占一半左右。
    会议根据一年来的实践，总结了公社办好集体福利事业的经验。会议认为，办好人民公社的福利事业，首先必须加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅。必须坚决地贯彻“积极办好，自愿参加”的方针，充分发动群众，通过摆事实、讲道理的方法，在广大社员中开展大鸣大放大辩论，辩清是非，统一认识。其次，要实行民主管理，走群众路线。每个食堂都要建立民主选举产生的伙食管理委员会，定期研究食堂的工作，并经常征求社员的意见改进伙食；办托儿组、幼儿园等也必须贯彻民主管理的原则。便利生产，便利家长。
    会议指出，办好公社集体福利事业，还要厉行节约，精打细算。郊区许多公共食堂实行了“粮食以人定量，分粮到户、入食堂带口粮，按定量和供给标准发饭票，凭票吃饭，节约钱粮归个人”等一整套办法，并且相应地建立了一套管理制度，在用粮上做到细水长流、先算后吃，农忙农闲调剂、稀干并吃，创造出省粮好吃的伙食管理方法。同时，大力开展炊具改革，减轻体力劳动，提高工作效率。这些经验值得坚持和推广。会议指出，为了办好食堂、托儿所、敬老院、缝纫组等集体福利事业，并要配备一定数量的党团员作骨干。食堂的炊事、管理人员应当经过群众推选，由成份好、思想好、办事公正、态度和气的人担任。
    会议认为，建立和健全财务制度也是办好公社集体福利事业的重要条件之一。有些食堂一年来建立了财务管理制度，清理整顿了账目，培养了会计人员，并推行计划管理，经济核算，按月计算盈亏，并向群众公布交群众审查，这样保证了食堂不断地巩固和发展。办托儿组织、敬老院也都应当有一套健全的管理制度。
    参加会议的有郊区十三个区（县）、公社、管理区、生产队的干部和食堂、托儿所、敬老院等管理服务人员共一千四百多人。中共北京市委书记处书记陈鹏在会上作了报告。他要求各级党委要全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活，在大力整顿巩固集体福利事业时，首先要办好公共食堂，因为它是集体福利事业的中心。其次要办好托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、缝纫组织。同时要结合生产，发动群众开展除四害讲卫生运动，进一步发展农村的医疗保健事业。当前，必须妥善解决社员冬季取暖问题，结合生产开展群众性的业余文化活动，使广大社员做到有劳有逸，全力投入今冬明春的大生产运动中。
