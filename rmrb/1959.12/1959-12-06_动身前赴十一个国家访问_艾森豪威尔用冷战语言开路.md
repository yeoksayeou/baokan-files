Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower left Washington on the evening of the 3rd to begin his visit to eleven countries in Asia, Africa, and Western Europe, and arrived in Rome, the capital of Italy, on the 4th, the first stop of his itinerary.

Eisenhower delivered a radio and television address before his departure. In his speech, he called this foreign visit a visit of "peace and goodwill."

In his speech, Eisenhower once again admitted that the credibility of the United States is declining abroad, and in the minds of some, the United States is "being portrayed as a country that only pursues material goals, and the culture it is building is marked by gadgets and shallow entertainment. It values wealth more than ideals, machines more than spirit, enjoyment more than learning, and war more than peace." However, Eisenhower attempted to portray these as the result of others "cleverly creating doubts about us."

Eisenhower then stated that the U.S. government will continue to expand its armaments and pursue a policy of "strength" in the future. He once again used "Cold War" language to insinuate that socialist countries are "atheistic imperialists" and "rapacious forces" engaged in "aggression, subversion, and infiltration," and advocated that the United States should continue to coerce its "allies" to "build (military) strength" through "joint security plans," and "maintain extremely strong defense." He said, "Without this military strength, our efforts to provide a shield for freedom and to maintain and strengthen peace will fail. We are determined to ensure that this strength is always suited to our needs in terms of quality and power, until the conference table can replace the battlefield as the arbiter of international affairs."

Eisenhower had to admit that the United States' policy of militarization is "extremely costly" and has placed a "heavy burden" on U.S. finances. He said that, for example, in the federal government's debt, the annual interest alone now reaches more than 9 billion U.S. dollars, which is equal to the entire federal budget expenditure in 1940. U.S. economic activity also faces a series of problems, including inflation. Eisenhower also expressed concern about the prolonged labor-management dispute in the U.S. steel industry. He said, "Despite months of efforts, labor and management in the steel industry have still not reached an agreement... the United States still faces the possibility of a renewed steel crisis in a few weeks. Because of this continuing dispute, instability, hesitation, and wavering are growing every day throughout the economy."

### 动身前赴十一个国家访问  艾森豪威尔用冷战语言开路

    动身前赴十一个国家访问
    艾森豪威尔用冷战语言开路
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔3日晚上离开华盛顿开始他对亚、非地区和西欧十一个国家的访问，并且在4日到达他行程中的第一站——意大利首都罗马。
    艾森豪威尔行前发表了一篇电台和电视演说。他在演说中把这次出国访问称为“和平和亲善”的访问。
    艾森豪威尔在演说中再一次承认，在国外，美国的信誉日益下降，在一些人的心目中，美国正“被说成是这样的国家：它只追求物质目的，它正在建立的文化是一种以小玩意和浅薄的娱乐为标记的文化。它珍视财富甚于理想，珍视机器甚于精神，爱好享受甚于学习，爱好战争甚于和平。”但是，艾森豪威尔企图把这些说成是别人“巧妙地制造了对我们的怀疑”的结果。
    艾森豪威尔接着表明，美国政府在今后仍将继续扩充军备，推行
  “实力地位”政策。他再一次用“冷战”的语言含沙射影地诬蔑社会主义国家是进行“侵略、颠复和渗透”的“无神论帝国主义”和“掠夺势力”，并且鼓吹美国要继续推行胁迫美国的“盟国”“建立（军事）力量”的“共同安全计划”，“维持极其强有力的防御”他说，“没有这种军事力量，我们为自由提供盾牌和维护和加强和平的努力将会落空。我们决心在会议桌可以代替战场来作为国际事务的仲裁者以前，使这种力量在质量和威力方面经常适合于我们的需要。”
    艾森豪威尔不得不承认，美国的穷兵黩武政策是“代价巨大”的，而且已经给美国财政造成了“沉重的负担”。他说，例如，在联邦政府的债务中，现在单是年利一项就达到每年九十多亿美元，等于1940年整个联邦预算开支。美国经济活动也面临一系列问题，其中包括通货膨胀。艾森豪威尔还对美国钢铁工业中的劳资争端迟迟不得解决表示忧虑不安。他说，“尽管经过几个月的努力，钢铁工业的劳方和资方仍然没有取得一致意见……，美国仍然面临在几个星期以后重新发生钢铁危机的可能性。由于这个继续存在的争论，在整个经济中，不稳、踌躇和犹豫每天都在增长。”
