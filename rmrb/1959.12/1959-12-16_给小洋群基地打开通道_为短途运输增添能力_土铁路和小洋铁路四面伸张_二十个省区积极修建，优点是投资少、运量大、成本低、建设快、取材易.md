Xinhua News Agency, December 15th. While building modern railways, various parts of the country have actively constructed local and small railways this year. Currently, some of the local and small railways built in twenty provinces and autonomous regions, including Anhui, Henan, Sichuan, Hebei, and Shanxi, have already opened to traffic.

These lines mostly lead to the production bases of the "small-scale industrial clusters" for the steel and coal industries, forest areas, and other areas with heavy short-distance transportation tasks, directly linking to railway trunk lines or waterway trunk lines. The lines that have already opened to traffic have proven that these local and small railways have the advantages of low investment, large capacity, low cost, fast construction, and the ability to acquire materials locally. According to calculations by relevant units in Henan Province, the longest local railway in Henan Province at present, the Luohe-Wuyang Railway, costs about one-fifth of the cost of a modern railway per kilometer; and the freight cost of the local railway is only one-eighth of the cost of automobile transportation. After the opening of the local railway in Yuxian County, Shanxi Province, it can transport 800 tons of goods per day, which is equivalent to the carrying capacity of more than 260 rubber-tired carts. Comparing the average freight rates of local automobiles and horse-drawn carts with the freight rate of this local railway, the entire construction investment can be recovered in eight months after the opening of this local railway. Bengbu City, Anhui Province, built a 1.1-kilometer-long local railway from the Huai River Wharf to the freight station of the railway trunk line, which can transport more than 2,000 tons of grain, coal, pig iron, and ore every day, and can replace 1,000 flatbed carts. The Huainan Coal Mine built a local railway within the mining area leading to small coal mines, which can transport 5,000 tons of coal per day, significantly expanding the capacity of small coal mines to transport raw coal.

The broad masses have experienced from actual life that the large-scale construction of local and small railways is of great significance for meeting the internal transportation needs of the "small-scale industrial clusters" production bases of the steel and coal industries and solving the current weak link in transportation—the problem of insufficient short-distance transportation capacity. Therefore, when they are building local railways through self-reliance, they overcome various difficulties and show a high degree of enthusiasm. The cast iron rails laid on the Luohe-Wuyang local railway in Henan were manufactured by the staff and workers of some local machinery factories after more than 30 experiments using locally produced local iron. During the construction of this railway, members of the local people's commune collected more than 200 tons of wrought iron, built iron-smelting furnaces on the spot, and manufactured more than 700,000 spikes and screws, ensuring the urgent needs of construction. Guangdong Province once organized 40 factories to cooperate in producing 20 small steam locomotives and more than 100 freight cars for local railways.

In the process of building local and small railways, from survey and design to construction and management and transportation, they have received enthusiastic help from the railway department. The Bengbu Railway Bureau has specially established a local railway technical guidance office to be responsible for guiding the design, construction, and maintenance of local railways, and organized units such as the Jiulonggang Rail Casting Factory, Locomotive Depot, and Hefei Engineering Section to produce cast iron rails, simple turnouts, and small locomotives for local railways. During the construction of the Luohe-Wuyang Railway, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau sent engineering and technical personnel to the site to provide guidance and trained a group of dispatchers, switchmen, and track nailers for this local railway.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 15th. The first small railway built by Shaanxi Province itself, the Tongchuan Chenluzhen-Taoyuan Railway, was officially completed and opened to traffic on the 12th. This railway is eight kilometers long. After it opens to traffic, it will mainly be responsible for transporting coal from the Tongchuan No. 4 Coal Mine to the Yigucun Station on the Xianyang-Tongchuan branch line. The No. 4 Coal Mine now produces 800 to 900 tons of coal per day. In the past, it was transported by trucks, requiring 40 trucks per day. Using this small railway for transportation, each trip carries 80 tons, and twelve trips a day and night can transport all of the coal. The freight rate is also greatly reduced compared to automobiles.

From the line survey, design, and construction to the manufacturing of locomotives, carriages, and rails, the Chen-Tao Small Railway was entirely resolved by Shaanxi Province itself. The rails were cast by the Xi'an Railway Bureau, Shaanxi Xi'an Automobile Parts Factory, and scientific research departments in cooperation, using local iron produced in the province. The steam locomotives and internal combustion locomotives were also manufactured in cooperation by the Xi'an Railway Bureau and Xi'an Automobile Parts Factory and other units. (Attached picture)

### 给小洋群基地打开通道　为短途运输增添能力  土铁路和小洋铁路四面伸张  二十个省区积极修建，优点是投资少、运量大、成本低、建设快、取材易

    给小洋群基地打开通道　为短途运输增添能力
    土铁路和小洋铁路四面伸张
    二十个省区积极修建，优点是投资少、运量大、成本低、建设快、取材易
    新华社15日讯　在修筑现代化铁路的同时，今年全国各地积极修建土铁路和小洋铁路。目前安徽、河南、四川、河北、山西等二十个省和自治区修建的土铁路、小洋铁路中，有些已经通车了。
    这些线路大多是通往钢铁、煤炭工业的“小洋群”生产基地、林区以及其他短途运输任务繁重的地区，直接和铁路干线或水运干线联结。已经通车的线路证明，这些土铁路和小洋铁路，有投资少、运量大、成本低、建设快和能够就地取材等优点。据河南省有关单位计算，河南省目前最长的土铁路——漯（河）舞（阳）铁路，每公里的造价约为现代化铁路造价的五分之一；而土铁路的运费，只有汽车运费的八分之一。山西省盂县的土铁路通车后，每天能运八百吨货物，相当于二百六十多辆胶轮大车的运力。以当地汽车、马车的平均运价和这条土铁路的运价比较计算，这条土铁路通车后八个月就可以收回全部建设投资。安徽省蚌埠市修建了一条一点一公里长的土铁路，从淮河码头通到铁路干线的货运站，每天能运粮食、煤炭、生铁、矿石二千多吨，可以代替一千辆平板车。淮南煤矿在矿区内修建了通往小煤井的土铁路，每天能运煤五千吨，显著地扩大了小煤井原煤外运能力。
    广大群众从实际生活中体验到，大量修建土铁路和小洋铁路，对于满足钢铁、煤炭工业“小洋群”生产基地的厂内运输和解决当前运输中的薄弱环节——短途运输能力不足的问题，都有十分重要的意义。因此，他们在自力更生地修筑土铁路时，克服各种困难，表现出了高度的热情。河南漯（河）舞（阳）土铁路所铺的铸铁铁轨，是当地一些机械工厂的职工，用当地生产的土铁经过三十多次试验制造出来的。在修筑这条铁路的过程中，当地人民公社的社员搜集了二百多吨熟铁，就地建起打铁炉，制造了七十多万个道钉、螺丝，保证了施工的急需。广东省曾经组织四十个工厂协作，为土铁路生产了二十台小蒸汽机车和一百多辆货车。
    各地在修筑土铁路和小洋铁路的过程中，从勘查设计、施工到管理运输，都得到了铁路部门的热情帮助。蚌埠铁路局专门成立了地方铁路技术指导处，负责指导土铁路的设计、施工和维修，并组织九龙岗铸轨厂、机务段和合肥工务段等单位，为土铁路生产了铸铁铁轨、简易道岔和小机车。郑州铁路局在漯（河）舞（阳）铁路修建时，派出了工程技术人员到现场指导，并为这条土铁路培训了一批调度员、扳道工和钉道员。
    新华社西安15日电　陕西省自己建设的第一条小洋铁路——铜川陈（陈炉镇）桃（桃园）铁路，12日正式建成通车。这条铁路全长八公里，通车后主要担负铜川第四煤矿到咸（阳）铜（川）支线宜古村车站间的运煤任务。第四煤矿现在日产煤八、九百吨，过去用汽车运输，每天需要四十辆汽车。用这条小铁路运输，每趟运八十吨，一昼夜运十二趟就可以全部运完，运价也比汽车大大降低。
    陈桃小铁路从线路勘测、设计、施工到机车、车箱、铁轨的制造，全是陕西省自己解决的。铁轨是西安铁路局、陕西省西安汽车配件厂和科学研究部门共同协作，用本省生产的土铁铸造的；蒸汽机车和内燃机车也是西安铁路局和西安汽车配件厂等单位协作制成的。（附图片）
