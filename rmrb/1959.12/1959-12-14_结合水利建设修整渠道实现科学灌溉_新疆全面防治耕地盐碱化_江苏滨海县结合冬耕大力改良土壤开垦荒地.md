    Xinjiang Comprehensively Prevents and Controls Soil Salinization by Combining Water Conservancy Construction to Renovate Canals and Achieve Scientific Irrigation
    Jiangsu Binhai County Combines Winter Ploughing to Vigorously Improve Soil and Reclaim Wasteland
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, December 13th. Xinjiang's people's communes, more than 160 military reclamation farms, and local state-owned farms are closely combining water conservancy construction to vigorously improve saline-alkali land and prevent soil salinization.
    This year's soil improvement in Xinjiang is characterized by: Due to the realization of people's communization, the vast majority of agricultural counties have entered a new stage of comprehensive and systematic treatment and prevention of soil salinization on the basis of completing soil surveys. In southern Xinjiang, where saline-alkali damage is severe, most counties, people's communes, and military reclamation farms have formulated plans to eradicate saline-alkali disasters. At present, these areas are organizing a large number of manpower to build and renovate drainage branches and main canals, connecting the previously dug scattered drainage ditches to form a drainage network. Gashi County, located in the lower reaches of the Kizil River, has concentrated 50% of the county's labor force to dig large drainage canals, determined to work hard this winter to realize the networking of drainage canals throughout the county. Nineteen large drainage canals have now been built, and a 120-mile-long main drainage canal is under construction. Upon completion of this drainage canal, the 500,000 mu of farmland in this area of military reclamation farms and people's communes will be completely free from the harm of saline-alkali.
    While digging large drainage canals and drainage networks, the people's communes are also extensively renovating old canals at all levels, leveling land, installing sluice gates, etc. In this way, 28% of the old cultivated areas will basically achieve scientific management and irrigation ditching in the coming winter and spring, eliminating the phenomenon of large amounts of river water seeping underground and flooding, which causes soil salinization. The Kashgar area, where saline-alkali land accounts for 60% of the total cultivated land area, and the people of eleven counties (cities), on the one hand, jointly formed four water conservancy armies to jointly manage the river channel projects of the Yarkand River, the Gez River, and the Kizil River within the area, eliminating the root causes of salinization, and on the other hand, vigorously carried out the reconstruction of internal canals and the leveling of land in the community, creating favorable conditions for scientific irrigation and the removal of saline-alkali. Up to now, the entire area has leveled more than 4.4 million mu of land, of which more than 2 million mu have achieved small plot irrigation.
    The people's communes and state-owned farms in the relatively warm Turpan Basin also used the winter slack season to flush saline-alkali wasteland and carry out winter irrigation, and combined winter irrigation with deep plowing, harrowing, and soil improvement. At present, the entire autonomous region has irrigated 1.8 million mu of winter fallow land.
    Xinjiang is located in the hinterland of the Asian continent, and most areas are arid and have little rain. The annual evaporation is ten to forty times greater than the amount of rainfall. More than 95% of the farmland relies on melting snow from the mountains for irrigation. However, many snowmelt rivers pass through salt-containing rocks and deserts, bringing a lot of salt to the cultivated land. Before liberation, due to the inability of farmers of all ethnic groups to carry out large-scale drainage projects and the lack of scientific irrigation methods, more than 30% of the cultivated land in the region was salinized to varying degrees. Especially in the lower reaches of various rivers south of the Tianshan Mountains, almost 60% or more of the cultivated land was affected by saline-alkali. In some areas, 30%-50% of the cultivated land was forced to be abandoned, and many farmers had to leave their homes and seek other ways to make a living.
    Since liberation, people of all ethnic groups have launched a struggle against saline-alkali disasters under the leadership of the Party and have achieved great results. Especially after the realization of communization, the achievements made in soil improvement work in various places have been particularly remarkable. Now, 3 million mu of cultivated land in the entire autonomous region has drainage ditches, and many cultivated lands that were abandoned due to severe salinization have been replanted with crops; the groundwater level of many cultivated lands has dropped by one to two meters compared with the original level. The Awati Commune in Bachu County, located in the lower reaches of the Yarkand River, has all its cultivated land salinized. The opening up of all the main and branch drainage canals in the winter of last year and the spring of this year has lowered the water level of about 80% of the cultivated land by about 1.5 meters. 10,000 mu of saline-alkali land that could not be sown in the past have been planted with cotton and rice.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Members of people's communes in Binhai County, Jiangsu Province, are actively improving saline-alkali land and preparing for spring planting next year.
    Binhai County, located in the coastal area, has a high salt content in the topsoil of most of its land. Some places cannot grow crops, and some places can barely grow crops, but the yield is very low. In order to increase the yield per unit area and expand the cultivated area, the Binhai County Committee of the Communist Party of China made reasonable arrangements for the county's labor force and耕牛 in winter ploughing. All communes and brigades have unified arrangements for labor, led by special personnel, and established soil improvement professional teams to reclaim wasteland and improve soil according to local conditions. Kangzhuang and Jiepai communes combined the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects to lower the groundwater level and improve the soil. Binhuai and Nanhe communes also adopted methods of diverting water for winter沤 or covering with raw grass to change the soil quality. In Huangwei, Liutao and other communes, some of the alkali land has very fertile black soil underground. The party committees of these communes mobilized members to deeply plough the land and turn out the black soil.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha. Members of the Julong Commune in Guzhang County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan Province, are launching activities to control mountains and improve soil, focusing on the construction of terraced fields. Since the beginning of November, the members have besieged seven large mountains, built more than 5,400 mu of terraced fields, and planted economic forests such as tung trees, tea trees, evergreen bamboo, and tea trees on the ridges of the terraced fields. At the same time, many sheep intestine trails were changed into more than 100 winding mountain roads.
    Julong Commune has always had more mountains and less land, and dry land accounts for about 60% of the entire cultivated land area, and the yield per unit area is very low. In order to change the low-yield appearance of the mountainous area, Ma Gengtian, the first secretary of the Guzhang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, went deep into the Gexin Brigade for investigation last year, and according to the characteristics of the mountainous area, proposed a plan to change slopes into terraced fields. According to this plan, the commune party committee led members to launch comprehensive mountain management and comprehensive utilization of mountain soil activities. They used the incomparable superiority of the people's commune, adapted to local conditions, made overall plans, and adopted measures combining large-scale corps assault and professional team operations to level land, take inside and fill outside, and change slopes into terraced fields.

    结合水利建设修整渠道实现科学灌溉
    新疆全面防治耕地盐碱化
    江苏滨海县结合冬耕大力改良土壤开垦荒地
    本报乌鲁木齐13日电　新疆各人民公社和一百六十多个军垦农场和地方国营农场，紧密结合水利建设，大力改良盐碱地和防止耕地盐碱化。
    今年新疆土壤改良的特点是：由于实现了人民公社化，绝大多数农业县在完成了土壤普查的基础上，进入了全面系统治理和预防土壤盐碱化的新阶段。盐碱危害严重的南疆地区，大多数县和人民公社以及军垦农场已制订了根治盐碱灾害的规划。目前这些地区正组织大批人力，兴修和整修排碱支渠和干渠，把以往挖的零星排碱沟连接起来，形成排水网。位于克孜河下游的伽师县，集中了全县50％的劳动力，大挖排碱渠，决心大干一冬，实现全县排碱渠网化，现在已修成了大型排碱渠十九条，一条一百二十多里的排碱总干渠正在紧张施工。焉耆垦区七个农场联合兴修一条三百三十四里、渠底宽十二米、渠口宽五十五米的塔里木总排水渠，目前已完成全部土石方工程的一半以上，力争年底完工。这条排水渠完工后，将使这一带军垦农场和人民公社的五十万亩耕地彻底消除盐碱的危害。
    与大挖排碱渠和排碱网的同时，各人民公社还在大规模地整修各级旧渠道、平整土地、安装水闸等，这样28％的旧耕作区将在今冬明春基本上实现管理科学化、灌溉沟畦化，消除河水大量渗流地下，以及漫灌串灌等造成耕地盐碱化的现象。盐碱化土地占全部耕地面积60％的喀什专区，十一个县（市）的人民，一面联合组成四支水利大军，共同治理专区境内叶尔羌河、盖孜河和克孜河等河河道工程，消除产生盐碱化的根源，一面大搞社内旧渠改建和平整土地，为科学灌溉和排除盐碱创造有利条件。到目前为止，全专区已平整土地四百四十多万亩，其中有二百多万亩已实现了小畦灌溉。
    气候比较温暖的吐鲁番盆地的人民公社和国营农场，还利用冬闲水冲洗盐碱荒地和进行冬灌，并结合冬灌大搞深翻、耙磨、改良土壤。目前，全自治区已灌溉冬闲地一百八十万亩。
    新疆地处亚洲大陆腹地，绝大部分地区干旱少雨，年蒸发量大于降雨量的十至四十倍，95％以上的农田都靠境内大山溶雪灌溉。但是有不少雪水河流经含盐的岩石和戈壁，便给耕地带来了不少盐分。解放前，由于各族农民无力大兴排碱工程，又缺乏科学的灌溉方法，致使全区的耕地30％以上都程度不同地发生盐碱化。尤其是天山以南各河流下游，几乎60％以上的耕地都受着盐碱的危害，个别地区被迫放弃的耕地达30％—50％，不少农民只得离乡背井，另谋生路。
    解放以来，各族人民已在党的领导下向盐碱灾害展开了搏斗，取得了很大的成绩。特别是实现公社化以后，各地在土壤改良工作上取得的成绩尤为显著。现在全自治区三百万亩耕地已有了排水沟，不少因盐碱化严重而放弃的耕地，已重新种上庄稼；不少耕地的地下水位，已较原来下降了一至两米。位于叶尔羌河下游巴楚县的阿瓦提公社，全部耕地都发生了盐碱化。去冬今春挖通了所有的排碱干渠和支渠，已使80％的耕地水位下降了一米五左右。以往无法播种的一万亩盐碱地，都种上了棉花和水稻。
    新华社南京讯　江苏省滨海县各人民公社社员积极改良荒碱地，作好明年春种准备。
    位于沿海地区的滨海县，绝大部分土地表土中含盐较多。有的地方不能种庄稼，有的地方虽然能勉强种上，但产量很低。为了提高单位面积产量，扩大耕地面积，在冬耕中，中共滨海县委把全县的劳力和耕牛作了合理安排。各公社、大队都统一安排了劳力，由专人领导，成立了土壤改良专业队，因地制宜地开垦荒地和改良土壤。康庄和界牌等公社结合兴修小型水利，降低地下水位，改良土壤。滨淮和南河等公社还分别采取引水冬沤或铺盖生草的办法改变土质。黄圩、六套等公社有一部分碱地，地下黑土非常肥沃，这些公社的党委就发动社员深翻地，把黑土翻出。
    新华社长沙讯　湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州古丈县巨龙公社的社员们，正在以修梯田为中心，展开治山改良土壤的活动。从11月上旬以来，社员们围攻七座大山头，修梯田五千四百多亩，并在梯田埂子上营造了桐树、茶树、常青竹、茶叶树等经济林。同时，把很多羊肠小道改为一百多条盘山大道。
    巨龙公社历来山多田少，旱土占整个耕地面积60％左右，单位面积产量很低。为了改变山区低产面貌，中共古丈县委第一书记马耕田，去年深入革新大队调查，根据山区特点，提出了改坡地为梯田的规划。根据这一规划，公社党委领导社员展开全面治山、综合利用山土的活动。他们运用人民公社的无比优越性，因地制宜，全面规划，采取大兵团突击与专业队作战相结合的措施，平整土地、取里填外，把坡地改为梯田。
