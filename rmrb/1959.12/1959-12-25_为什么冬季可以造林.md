　　Why Afforestation Is Possible in Winter
    Except for high and cold regions in our country, afforestation can be carried out in all seasons. Winter afforestation is of great practical significance in our country, because it can be combined with winter water conservancy construction, road repairs, and soil and water conservation, which is really killing two birds with one stone and achieving twice the result with half the effort. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many places carried out afforestation by breaking frozen soil after it was frozen, and the survival rate generally reached over 70% to 80%. Experience has shown that as long as attention is paid to implementing the technical measures for winter afforestation, the soil clods are broken up when planting trees, and they are buried tightly, afforestation can also be carried out after the soil freezes. In the south, the winter climate is not too cold, making it more suitable for carrying out winter afforestation.
    Why can afforestation be carried out in winter? What are its advantages? Because when trees reach winter, their own growth activities stop and gradually enter a dormant state. Taking advantage of this time to transplant seedlings for afforestation will not cause any damage to the trees themselves, so it is easy to survive.
    In winter, due to weak sunlight, low temperature, and less water evaporation, the moisture in the soil is relatively sufficient, and the water consumption of trees is also greatly reduced due to leaf fall and dormancy. Therefore, starting seedlings for afforestation at this time can not only reduce the wilting of seedlings due to excessive evaporation of water during transportation, but even if some roots are damaged during transplanting, temporarily weakening the ability to absorb water, it will not affect the vitality of the seedlings. By early spring of the following year, before the seedlings germinate and grow leaves, the root system has recovered its growth ability and begins to absorb water to supply the seedlings' growth needs. Planting trees in winter is when the seedlings take root first and then grow leaves, which can reduce or even avoid the slow seedling stage, making them resistant to drought, surviving more, and growing well.
    In winter, not only can trees be planted for afforestation, but also trunk burial and cutting propagation can be carried out. Trunk burial is burying well-cut thick branches in the soil; cutting propagation is inserting well-cut branches into the soil. Because the sap concentration of trees is high in winter and the flow is very slow, the trunks, branches, and winter buds store a large amount of nutrients, which have sufficient vitality for rooting and sprouting. In the second spring, they will also root first and then sprout, and the survival rate is reliable.
    In areas without severe animal damage, direct seeding afforestation can also be carried out. Winter direct seeding afforestation means that from the time the seeds are sown in the soil to the time they germinate, it is equivalent to treating the seeds in the soil for germination promotion, and they can germinate and emerge from the soil early next spring.

### 为什么冬季可以造林

　　为什么冬季可以造林
    我国除高寒地区，一年四季都可造林。冬季造林在我国有很大的现实意义，因为它可以结合冬修水利、整修道路、水土保持等项工作一并进行，真是一举两得，事半功倍。在大跃进的一九五八年，有不少地方在封冻以后，破冻土造林，成活率一般达到百分之七十到百分之八十以上。经验证明，只要注意执行冬季造林的技术措施，在栽树时把土块打碎，埋的严实，土壤封冻后也一样可以造林。在南方，冬季气候不太冷，更适宜开展冬季造林。
    冬季为什么可以造林呢？它的好处是什么呢？因为树木到了冬天，本身的生长活动停止，并逐渐进入休眠状态。趁这时移苗造林，树木本身不会受到什么损害，所以容易成活。
    冬天，还由于阳光弱、温度低、水分蒸发量较小，土壤里的水分比较充足，树木由于落叶、休眠，水分的消耗量也大大减少。因此，在这时起苗造林，不仅可以减少树苗运输过程中因蒸发水分过多而枯萎，即使树苗在移植时损伤了一部分根系，暂时削弱了吸收水分的能力，也不致影响苗木的生命力。到次年早春，树苗萌芽发叶以前，根系已恢复生长能力，开始吸收水分供应树苗生长需要。冬季栽树是树苗先扎根后生叶，这样就可以减少甚至避免了缓苗期，抗旱力强，成活得多，长得好。
    冬季不仅可以植树造林，也可以埋干、插条造林。埋干就是把截好的粗大树枝埋在土里；插条就是把截好的树条插入土中。因为冬天树液浓度大，流动很慢，干、条和冬芽里保存大量养分，对生根发芽具有充分的生命力，到第二年春同样是先生根后发芽，成活可靠。
    在没有严重兽害的地区，还可以直播造林。冬季直播造林，由于土壤里有一定的温度和水分，从种子播种在土壤里到发芽这一个时期，就等于在土壤中把种子进行了催芽处理，明春就可以早发芽出土。
