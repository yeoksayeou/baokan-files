Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd: To ensure winter wheat survives the winter well, various areas in Henan Province are applying fertilizer and watering, earnestly strengthening wheat field management. Currently, 53% of the winter wheat in the province has been fertilized, over 17 million mu have been irrigated, and over 15 million mu have been cultivated. Generally, the wheat seedlings are growing well, with deep roots, thick stems, vigorous growth, and tillering, presenting a lush green scene.

While vigorously developing water conservancy construction, people's communes in various areas of Henan have fixed professional labor to engage in wheat field management, carrying out activities such as checking seedlings and replanting, while accumulating and applying fertilizer. Replanting has been completed in over 10 million mu of wheat fields in the province that were missing seedlings. Nineteen counties and cities, including Changge, Xiangcheng, Yucheng, and Meng County, have completed the first round of fertilization. In Dancheng County, the wheat field management professional teams, along with shock teams, totaled over 200,000 people, using various vehicles and livestock to universally fertilize 1.25 million mu of wheat fields throughout the county. Eighty thousand mu have been fertilized a second time, with an average fertilization rate of 50 dan per mu, 500,000 mu irrigated with root-promoting water, and 800,000 mu cultivated. Currently, the growth of over 90,000 mu of third-class seedlings has caught up with that of last year's second-class seedlings. In order to ensure the quality of wheat field fertilization, each commune in Changge County has formed a quality inspection and acceptance team composed of cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers, based on production brigades, to inspect and accept the fertilization quality of each square, each plot, and each mu. The management of third-class seedlings in various areas generally adopts measures such as assigning teams to each plot, conducting classified consultations, applying fertilizer according to the condition of the wheat, replenishing what is lacking, and addressing issues of excessive water, excessive fertilizer, or poor management. The Chengguan People's Commune in Shangcai County had 1,050 mu of wheat fields that were planted late, and the seedlings were yellow and weak. The commune members took a shock approach, applying 120 dan of seedling fertilizer per mu, which quickly upgraded the yellow and weak wheat seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 2nd: Commune members in the winter wheat producing areas of Gansu Province have sent most of the warm seedling manure to the fields. At present, 30% of the winter wheat in the province has been covered with warm seedling fertilizer.

This year, the winter wheat sowing time in Gansu Province was shortened by 10 to 15 days compared to last year. The wheat fields were universally deep-plowed once, with an average application of approximately 7,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, an increase of 30% compared to last year. At the same time, rational close planting was carried out according to local conditions, and the promotion of improved varieties was conducted. In the two major winter wheat regions of Pingliang and Tianshui, almost all seeds were carefully selected. Drought-resistant and cold-resistant superior varieties planted in Pingliang Prefecture account for more than 50% of the total winter wheat sown area. After sowing, various areas immediately organized the masses to check seedlings and replant. This year, the winter wheat emerged uniformly and is now tillering, with the ridges lush and green.

Under the slogan of "manage early, manage well, manage skillfully," various areas have widely established winter wheat field management professional teams. Immediately after winter wheat sowing, they seized the season and grasped the key points, taking various measures to strengthen field management. The three prefectures of Tianshui, Dingxi, and Zhangye have formed over 10,000 winter wheat field management professional teams, and implemented the wheat file management responsibility system in 30% of the high-yield fields. In the early management of wheat, people's communes in various areas "take fertilizer as the leader," combining irrigation and pest control to vigorously attack third-class seedlings. Currently, first-class seedlings account for 92% of the winter wheat land in the province, while second and third-class seedlings account for only 8%.

When the "Three Autumns" production entered its final stage, the Party committees in the winter wheat producing areas of Gansu mobilized the masses to prepare sufficient fertilizer for covering the winter wheat. Some areas also adopted continuous operations methods of accumulating fertilizer, producing fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, and covering fertilizer, ensuring that fertilizer was accumulated, transported, and covered well. Members of the winter wheat field management professional teams in Shandan County have launched a shock campaign to transport over 200,000 carts of manure for 100,000 mu of winter wheat. Cadres in Jingchuan County led the masses to apply topdressing fertilizer to wheat fields before the Beginning of Winter, and are now covering warm seedling fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 2nd: In the three prefectures of Jinan, Jinzhong, and J东南 in Shanxi Province, a total of 790,000 laborers have formed professional teams to strengthen winter field management of wheat.

According to the formulated winter management plan for wheat fields, each county in Jin东南 Prefecture has universally applied fertilizer, winter irrigation, and eliminated yellow rust disease in wheat fields. At present, the whole area has winter-irrigated 220,000 mu of wheat, and fertilized and rolled 280,000 mu each. As soon as the wheat field management professional team organized in Jinan Prefecture took action, it conducted a seedling check and replanting on all wheat fields, quickly completing the seedling check and replanting task on more than 1 million mu of missing seedlings. Counties such as Jishan, Hongtong, and Wanrong harrowed and rolled wildly growing wheat fields to suppress excessive growth. At the same time, the whole area universally carried out pest control on more than 70,000 mu of wheat fields where pests had been discovered. Various counties also organized a 250,000-person fertilizer accumulation professional team, which applied an average of about 70 dan of warm ditch fertilizer per mu to 1.53 million mu of wheat fields within half a month. The Jinzhong area universally launched a competition to catch up the stubble with the regular stubble, weak seedlings with strong seedlings, large fields with small fields, and dry land with irrigated land, greatly reducing the number of third-class wheat fields. The commune members praised, "Looking from afar, it's all green, there are no missing ridges up close, the mountains and plains are the same, and the old stubble and the regular stubble cannot be distinguished."

    河南甘肃山西精管冬小麦
    普浇盘根水
    追施暖苗肥
    新华社郑州2日电　河南省各地为保证小麦过好越冬关，正在追肥、加水，认真加强麦田管理。现在，全省冬麦有53％追过肥，有一千七百多万亩浇过水，有一千五百多万亩中耕过。一般麦苗生长发育良好，根深、茎粗、发旺、分蘖，一片葱绿。
    河南各地人民公社在大兴水利建设的同时，都固定专业劳力从事麦田管理，边开展查苗补种，边积肥追肥。全省一千多万亩缺苗断垅的麦田，已经补种完毕。长葛、襄城、虞城、孟县等十九个县市已追完第一遍肥。郸城县麦田管理专业队加上突击队伍共二十多万人，利用各种车辆、牲畜，为全县一百二十五万亩麦田普遍追肥一次，有八十万亩追了第二遍，平均每亩追肥量达五十担，浇盘根水五十万亩，中耕八十万亩。现在，全县九万多亩三类苗，已经赶上去年二类苗的生长情况。长葛县为了保证麦田追肥质量，各公社都以大队为单位，由干部、技术员、老农组成麦田追肥质量检查验收小组，逐方、逐片、逐块、逐亩检查验收。各地对三类苗的管理，一般都采取逐块站队、分类会诊，看麦施肥，缺啥补啥，偏水、偏肥、偏管理的措施。上蔡县城关人民公社有一千零五十亩种得较晚的麦田，苗儿黄瘦，社员们采取大突击，每亩施苗肥一百二十担，使黄瘦的麦苗很快升了级。
    新华社兰州2日电　甘肃省冬小麦产区人民公社社员们，已将大部分冬麦暖苗粪送到地头。目前，全省冬麦已有30％铺盖了暖苗肥。
    今年甘肃省冬麦播种时间较去年缩短十天到半月，麦田普遍深耕一遍，每亩平均施底肥七千斤左右，比去年增加30％；同时，因地制宜地进行了合理密植和推广良种工作。平凉、天水两个主要冬麦专区，种子几乎全部精选过。平凉专区种植的抗旱抗寒优良品种，约占全部冬麦播种面积的50％以上；在下种之后，各地随即组织群众查苗补苗。今年冬麦出苗整齐，现在正在分蘖，满垅青葱。
    在“管早、管好、管巧”的口号下，各地广泛地建立了冬麦田间管理专业队，冬麦播种后立即抢节令、抓关键，采取各种措施加强田间管理。天水、定西、张掖三个专区组成了一万多个冬麦田间管理专业队，在30％的丰产田里推行了小麦档案管理责任制度。各地人民公社在小麦早期管理中，“以肥为帅”，结合灌水、防治病虫害，猛攻三类苗。现在全省冬麦地一类苗占92％，二、三类苗只占8％。
    甘肃冬麦产区的党委在“三秋”生产进入尾声时，就发动群众为给冬麦盖肥准备下足够的肥料。有些地区还采取积肥、造肥、送肥、盖肥的连续作业方法，做到肥料随积、随运、随盖好。山丹县冬麦田间管理专业队的队员们，已为十万亩冬麦突击运粪二十多万车。泾川县的干部们率领群众在立冬前给麦田施过一次追肥，现在又在铺盖暖苗肥。
    新华社太原2日电　山西省晋南、晋中、晋东南三个专区共有七十九万多个劳力组成专业队伍，加强小麦的冬季田间管理。
    晋东南专区各县按照制定的麦田越冬管理计划，普遍给麦田追肥、冬浇、消灭黄锈病害。目前全区已冬浇小麦二十二万亩，追肥和镇压各二十八万亩。晋南专区组织的麦田管理专业队伍一上阵，就对所有麦田进行了一次查苗补苗，迅速完成了一百多万亩缺苗断垅的查苗补苗任务。稷山、洪洞、万荣等县对狂长的麦田进行了耙耱和镇压，抑制了狂长。同时，全区各地对已发现的七万多亩有虫害的麦田普遍进行了除治。各县还组织了二十五万人的积肥专业队伍，半个月内给一百五十三万亩麦田平均每亩追施了七十担左右暖沟肥。晋中区普遍开展了回茬赶正茬、弱苗赶强苗、大田赶小田、旱地赶水地的竞赛运动，使三类麦田大大减少。社员们赞扬道：“远看绿茵茵，近看无断垅，山地平川一个样，老茬赶茬分不清。”（附图片）
