Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd: Hanoi newspapers on the 3rd published a statement by the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly strongly condemning the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's so-called "policy towards former resistance members."

The statement said that in order to maintain its rule and suppress the growing struggle movement of the Vietnamese people, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is mobilizing troops to conduct large-scale "sweeps" and massacres in former resistance bases, and has promulgated Decree No. 10 of 1959, trampling on the most basic principles of justice and humanity. It has also established "mobile military tribunals" to create an atmosphere of terror throughout South Vietnam.

The statement said that the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns the current conspiracies and barbaric acts of the US-Ngo clique in South Vietnam. It demands that the South Vietnamese authorities stop retaliating against and persecuting former resistance members and patriotic people in South Vietnam, disband all concentration camps, and abolish Decree No. 10 of 1959 and the so-called "policy towards former resistance members."

The statement concluded that the people of the world, who have deep feelings for the Vietnamese people's past resistance and today's just struggle, will stand on the side of the Vietnamese people. The increasingly isolated US-Ngo clique will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. Final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 8th: People from all walks of life in North Vietnam have been holding rallies in recent days, and writing letters and telegrams to relevant international organizations, protesting the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's death sentence for former resistance member Hoang Le Kha and calling for the rescue of his life.

Hoang Le Kha was the chairman of the Resistance Administrative Committee of Duong Minh Chau District, Tay Ninh Province, southern South Vietnam, and was sentenced to death by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's "Special Military Tribunal" on February 2 this year.

More than 2,100 people from Hanoi Teachers' Training College held a rally on the evening of the 6th, firmly demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities revoke the death sentence for Hoang Le Kha, abolish the fascist Decree No. 10 of 1959, and abandon the policy of persecution and retaliation.

Seven hundred and fifty teachers and students from Thanh Hoa Provincial Intermediate Teachers' School, where Hoang Le Kha's daughter, Hoang Thi Nhan, is studying, held a rally and march on the 5th, demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities restore Hoang Le Kha's freedom.

Famous lawyer Du Xuan Shuang sent telegrams to the South Vietnamese "Ministry of National Defense," "Ministry of Justice," and the Saigon Bar Association, informing them that Hoang Le Kha's father had hired him to defend Hoang Le Kha.

Hoang Le Kha's daughter, Hoang Thi Nhan, wrote a letter on the 4th to the youth and students of North and South Vietnam, calling on them to work together to save her father. The "People's Daily" published a commentary today saying that since the promulgation of Decree No. 10 of 1959, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has carried out seventeen trials, including thirteen death sentences. The commentary said that for the sake of the lives of thousands of former resistance people in South Vietnam who are under threat, the Vietnamese people must sever the bloody claws of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

    据新华社河内电　河内各报3日刊登了越南国会常务委员会严厉谴责吴庭艳集团的所谓“对前抗战人员政策”的声明。
    声明说，吴庭艳集团为了维持它的统治地位，镇压越南人民日益壮大的斗争运动，正出动军队对各个前抗战根据地进行大规模的“扫荡”和屠杀，并且公布了1959年第十号法令，蹂躏了最起码的公理和人道原则。它还设立了“流动军事法庭”，在南越各地制造恐怖气氛。
    声明说，越南民主共和国国会常务委员会严厉谴责美吴集团目前在南越的阴谋和野蛮行为。要求南越当局停止对前抗战人员和南越爱国人民的报复和迫害，解散所有的集中营，废除1959年第十号法令和所谓“对前抗战人员政策”。
    声明最后说，对越南人民过去的抗战和今天的正义斗争怀有深厚感情的全世界人民，将站在越南人民这边。日益孤立的美吴集团将不可避免地遭到可耻的失败。最后的胜利一定属于越南人民。
    据新华社河内8日电　越南北方各界人民连日举行集会，同时写信和打电报给有关国际组织，抗议吴庭艳集团判处前抗战人员黄励柯死刑，呼吁拯救他的生命。
    黄励柯是前南越南部西宁扬明珠县抗战行政委员会主席，在今年2月2日被吴庭艳集团的“特别军事法庭”判处死刑。
    河内师范大学两千一百多人在6日晚上举行集会，坚决要求南越当局撤销对黄励柯的死刑的判决，废除1959年第十号法西斯法令，并且放弃迫害和报复政策。
    黄励柯的女儿黄氏寅就读的清化省中级师范学校师生七百五十人在5日举行集会和游行，要求南越当局恢复黄励柯的自由。
    著名律师杜春爽分别致电南越“国防部”、“司法部”和西贡律师委员会，通知它们说，黄励柯的父亲已经聘请他为黄励柯辩护。
    黄励柯的女儿黄氏寅在4日写信给越南北方和南方的青年和学生，呼吁他们共同来拯救她的父亲。“人民报”今天发表评论说，吴庭艳集团自从颁行1959年第十号法令以来，已经进行了十七次判决，其中死刑判决有十三起。评论说，为了正在遭受威胁的南越成千上万的前抗战人民的生命，越南人民一定要斩断美国—吴庭艳集团血腥的魔爪。
