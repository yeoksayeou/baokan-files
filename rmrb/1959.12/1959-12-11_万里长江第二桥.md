The morning sun is rising. The Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing City looks exceptionally magnificent this morning.

A year ago, this place was still known as the Yangtze River chasm, but now, a double-track railway bridge more than 800 meters long has been built. The train roared toward the bridgehead, whistling, spitting out clouds of flower-like smoke in the morning air, and then smoothly crossed the chasm, speeding towards the northern section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway.

This is a miracle! A large iron bridge, second only to the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in engineering scale, was completed in just fourteen months, a full ten months ahead of the original planned schedule, and the quality of the project is excellent.

In the process of conquering this natural chasm of the Yangtze River, the heroic bridge-building workers encountered countless difficulties and underwent countless arduous tests. There is the turbulent river water, known as "no fish can gradually live on the bottom of the river," the bottom of the river has dangerous and jagged rocks, and there is a pebble layer as deep as seven meters. The riverbed is complex, and the isolated rocks are large and hard. When people are fighting against difficulties, they must also race against the flood; because the success or failure of each battle is closely related to whether the bridge will be delayed by one year or completed one year ahead of schedule.

The Battle Under the Water

During the days of rushing to repair the bridge foundation, the battle at the bottom of the river was very intense. Almost every pier foundation project in the water could not be separated from divers. They fought stubbornly and heroically hundreds of times at the bottom of the water.

During the construction of the foundation of the No. 3 pier, because there were hard isolated rocks on the sand and gravel covering layer at the bottom of the river, the steel sheet piles could not be driven in. Before the steel sheet pile cofferdam placed on the covering layer of the riverbed was sealed with concrete, the bottom layer of the cofferdam must be tightly fastened with steel wire ropes so that the steel sheet piles can be well stressed when pouring concrete. This was a difficult and dangerous task. Xu Xianye, the experienced diving foreman, personally took on this task.

Xu Xianye dived into the water and felt darkness all around, and the rapid current kept rushing towards him. He was pushed and swayed, and barely touched the steel sheet pile. He used all his strength to pull the steel wire rope, fastening it section by section. Soon he was panting, his arms were sore and numb, and his whole body had no strength. When he unconsciously loosened his hand, a stream of river water immediately rushed him from one side of the steel sheet pile to the other. "No, I must not stop!" With his strong will, this veteran worker continued to climb forward, grabbing the steel sheet pile one by one. After arduous struggles, he finally fastened the bottom layer of the steel sheet pile with steel wire rope.

When the pier foundation project was in full swing, a large number of pebbles were suddenly found at the bottom of the river, blocking the way of the pipe piles. People came up with various ways to test, but after more than twenty days, the work efficiency was still very low. One day, the old bridge worker Jiao Qiyi put forward a method - using a hydraulic stone suction cylinder to suck up the pebbles. However, the pebbles at the bottom of the river were too large, and the single water pump stone suction cylinder could not suck them up, so a double water pump had to be used, which could be dangerous. People debated this method. The bridge Party committee actively supported Jiao Qiyi's method, and at the same time organized technicians to formulate proper measures to prevent all kinds of dangers.

After a day of preparation, the tense experiment finally began. Late at night, the river surface was misty, the No. 6 pier was brightly lit, and the cold wind was howling. Jiao Qiyi, the loading and unloading foreman in charge of the command, quickly secured his short jacket and, after installing the two water pumps with his partners, told everyone to stay away from the pier. With the assistance of the Party branch secretary and the trade union group leader, Jiao Qiyi began to carefully climb towards the pipe pile. After he issued the order to turn on the water pump, all eyes were nervously watching him. Suddenly, a rumbling sound came from the pipe pile, and he immediately flashed his body, tightly clinging to the huge pipe pile wall, and a high and large column of water suddenly rose. The crane lifted the stone suction cylinder full of pebbles, and the pebbles were finally sucked out in large quantities.

When talking about the struggle with the complex rock formations at the bottom of the river, people can never forget the story of the pneumatic drill workers overcoming isolated rocks.

Large pieces of hard isolated rocks were deeply buried at the bottom of the river. If the isolated rocks were not drilled through, the pipe piles of the No. 3 pier could not sink to the basic rock layer, and the foundation project would be difficult to proceed smoothly.

Chen Zaoting, the drilling foreman, was particularly anxious. He remembered what the Party committee secretary had said: "You have to find tricks, you can't be reckless." But what kind of tricks could he find? One day, he suddenly remembered the past when he first learned drilling technology at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. That time, he was interning on the shore. Because he made the drill guide too short, the drill bit bumped around, and the hole was always drilled too large and did not meet the regulations; later, the Soviet expert made the guide wood longer, and the hole became smaller. Recalling this incident, he had a flash of inspiration, thinking: if the hole is drilled larger, can't the pipe pile sink? When he talked about this idea, the leadership organized everyone to study and repeatedly test it together, and finally decided to adopt this method.

The first newly modified drilling machine roared on the construction site. The drill bit sharply chiseled through the isolated rock and drilled a big hole. Finally, the isolated rock was overcome, and the pipe pile sank successfully.

Whipping the Horse to Speed Up Steel Beam Assembly

After the heroes fought day and night with the turbulent waves and stubborn rocks, the bridge piers in the water were completed far ahead of schedule. Now the task at hand is how to make the beam erection project also catch up at full speed. Therefore, loading and unloading workers, riveters, carpenters, and painters showed their skills and launched a battle to seize time and ensure quality.

In the summer of this year, they braved the scorching sun and stepped on the hot steel beams to fight for the early erection of the steel beams to the south bank.

A major difficulty facing the loading and unloading workers and the assembly workers was that the circular line connecting the bridgehead had not yet been completed, and the pre-assembled components weighing more than ten tons could not be transported to the bridgehead. The workers offered ingenious ideas and many plans. After comparison and research, many people believed that the cantilever beam assembly method proposed by the chief engineer was indeed better when the water level was high; however, Che Zilin, the deputy captain of the second bridge team, felt that it would take at least ten days to manufacture the cantilever beam, which was too long, and it would also require a lot of steel to make the cantilever beam. "Can't we find a better way?" Che Zilin racked his brains day and night. After pondering for many nights, Che Zilin came up with a parallel assembly method. He put forward this plan at the Party general branch committee, but after everyone's research, it was difficult to realize this method due to the lack of steel.

Encouraged and supported by the Party general branch, Che Zilin generated a second plan after the first failed. The scenes of past bridge construction appeared one after another in the mind of this old bridge worker with decades of experience. He remembered the method of assembling with floating crane barges used on the Jianghan Bridge, but he also thought that it was a highway bridge, and the components only weighed a few tons, while here, a pre-assembled component weighed more than ten tons. Could this experience be used under new conditions? He ran around, seeking wise men and visiting friends everywhere. The engineer helped him calculate, the surveying team helped him measure the flow rate, the workers of the water-based joint crane barge helped him measure the length of the derrick, and the crane driver studied with him how to lift. Due to giving full play to collective wisdom, the problems were solved one by one. Finally, the bridge Party committee decided to adopt this method. The result of the first test lift was that a truss beam was assembled in only nine days; later, after further research and improvement, the third and fourth truss beams were erected in five and a half days and five days respectively.

Wisely Breaking Through the Materials Barrier

In the process of building the bridge, the workers also encountered many difficulties such as incomplete machinery and insufficient materials. However, the more difficulties there were, the more the infinite wisdom of the bridge workers was demonstrated. They have successively realized more than 10,000 innovation proposals, saving a large amount of materials, machinery, and manpower.

Not long after the bridge construction started, the construction site urgently needed to make three sets of steel cofferdams, but the existing steel was only enough to make two sets.

Gu Hongqi, a young engineer, had been thinking about this problem for a long time. Although he went to bed very late every night, he had not found a good solution. One late night, he tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. He turned over, put on his clothes, and looked at the materials again. When he turned to the riverbed data, he suddenly thought that the No. 5 pier needed more steel, mainly because the riverbed rock layer was low and soft. If the fixed support was moved to the No. 6 pier with high and strong rock layers to bear the braking force, the cofferdam could be reduced, so wouldn't the steel be enough? Like suddenly finding a ray of light in the darkness, he discussed it with everyone the next day. The comrades encouraged him, and the leaders gave him great support. Many people also took time off work to help him.

Gu Hongqi's proposal was finally successful after people's multiple discussions, debates, supplements, and revisions. This proposal saved the country more than seventy tons of steel, more than three hundred cubic meters of concrete, and four pipe piles, and greatly accelerated the speed of bridge construction.

Under the leadership of the bridge Party committee, people have worked together in this way, overcoming numerous difficulties, using the least machinery, manpower, and materials, and building the second bridge on the Yangtze River with high speed and high quality. (Attached picture)

    万里长江第二桥
    新华社记者　胡明俊　李祥涛　黎素芬
    朝阳升起来了。清晨的重庆市白沙沱长江大桥，显得分外雄伟壮丽。
    一年前，这里还被人称作长江天堑，而现在，一座八百多米长的双线铁路桥修起来了。火车呼叫着驶向桥头，呜呜地，在晨空中吐出一团团花朵般的烟云，然后平稳地越过天堑，向川黔铁路的北段飞驰而去。
    这是个奇迹！一座工程仅次于武汉长江大桥的大铁桥，只用十四个月时间就全部落成，比原来计划工期足足提前了十个月，而且工程质量优良。
    在征服这天堑长江的过程中，英雄的建桥职工们不知遇到过多少次困难，经历过多少次艰苦的考验。这里有号称“江底无渐鱼”的湍急的江水，江底有险恶嶙峋的怪石，有深达七米的卵石层。河床复杂，孤石又大又硬。人们在向困难作斗争的时候，还必须跟洪水争分夺秒；因为每一次战斗的成败，都紧紧关系着大桥是延期一年，还是提前一年修成。
    水底的战斗
    在抢修桥基的日子里，江底的战斗十分紧张。水中每一个桥墩基础工程，几乎都不能离开潜水工。他们在水底成百次地顽强而英勇地搏斗着。
    在修建三号桥墩基础的时候，因为江底砂夹卵石覆盖层上有坚硬的孤石，钢钣桩无法打入，放在河床的覆盖层上，钢钣桩围堰用混凝土封底以前，必须用钢丝绳紧紧箍住围堰的底层，这样浇灌混凝土时才能使钢钣桩良好受力。这是个困难而危险的作业。富有经验的潜水工长徐贤业亲自担负了这项任务。
    徐贤业潜入水中，只觉得四围黑沉沉的，急流不断地向他扑来。他被冲得东倒西歪，好容易才摸着钢钣桩。他使出全副力气拉着钢丝绳，把它一节一节地箍上去，不久就累得气喘，手臂又酸又麻，全身没有一点力气。当他不自觉地把手一松，一股江水立刻把他从钢钣桩的这一面冲到另一面去了。“不，决不能停！”这位老工人用刚毅的意志，又继续一把一把地攀着钢钣桩前进。经过艰苦的搏斗，他终于用钢丝绳把钢钣桩的底层箍好了。
    当桥墩基础工程正在紧张进行的时候，江底忽然发现了大批卵石，挡住管柱的去路。人们想出各式各样的办法试验，二十几天过去了，工效仍然很低。一天，老桥工焦其义提出一个办法——用水力吸石筒吸卵石。可是河底卵石太大，单水泵吸石筒吸不起来，必须用双水泵，而这样就可能发生危险。人们对这个办法展开了争论。大桥党委积极支持焦其义的办法，同时组织技术人员制定防止种种危险的妥善措施。
    经过一天的准备，紧张的试验终于开始了。深夜，江面白雾弥漫，六号墩上灯火通明，寒风呜呜地刮着。担任指挥的装吊工长焦其义，紧扎短袄，同伙伴们迅速安好两个水泵以后，便叫大家远离桥墩。在党支部书记和工会组长的协助下，焦其义开始小心翼翼地向管柱爬去。当他发出开水泵的命令以后，所有的眼睛都紧张地注视着他。突然，隆隆的声音从管柱里发出，他立刻身子一闪，紧贴着巨大的管柱壁猛然升起了又高又大的水柱。起重机吊起装满卵石的吸石筒，卵石终于被大批的吸出来了。
    谈起同江底复杂岩层作斗争的时候，人们总不能忘记风钻工人战胜孤石的故事。
    大块的坚硬的孤石深深地埋在江底，不钻通孤石，三号墩的管柱就无法下沉到基本岩层，基础工程也就难以顺利施工。
    钻孔工长陈藻廷特别焦急。他想起党委书记曾经讲过的话：“要想窍门，不能蛮干。”可是，想什么窍门呢？一天，他忽然想起了在武汉长江大桥最初学钻工技术的往事。那一次，他在岸上实习，由于把钻头导向木弄得太短，钻头东撞西碰，孔总是钻得很大，不合规定；后来，苏联专家把导向木改长了，孔才小起来。回忆起这件事，他灵机一动，心想：如果把孔钻大，管柱不就可以下沉了么？当他把这个想法谈出来以后，领导上就组织大家一起来研究和反复试验，最后决定采用这个办法。
    第一架新改的钻机在工地上轰隆隆地响了起来。钻头锋锐地凿通孤石，钻出了一个大窟窿。终于，战胜孤石，管柱胜利地下沉了。
        快马加鞭拼钢梁
    经过英雄们同惊涛顽石昼夜激战，水中桥墩都大大提前完成。现在摆在面前的任务，是怎样使架梁工程也快马加鞭地赶上。于是，装吊工、铆工、木工、油漆工们大显身手，展开了抢时间、保质量的战斗。
    在今年夏季，他们就顶着炎热的太阳，脚踏发烫的钢梁，为早日把钢梁架到南岸去而奋斗。
    横在装吊工和拼装工们面前的一大困难，是紧接桥头的环行线还没有修好，重达十吨多的预拼好的杆件无法运往桥头。职工们纷纷献妙计，提许多方案。经过比较研究，不少人认为总工程师提出的挑梁拼装法在水位高涨时使用的确比较好；但是第二桥队副队长车字林觉得，制造挑梁起码需要十多天，时间太长，做挑梁还要用许多钢材。“能不能找个更好的办法呢？”车字林日夜焦思苦想。琢磨了多少个晚上，车字林才想出一个平行拼装的办法。他在党总支委员会上提出这个方案，但是经大家研究结果，终因钢材缺乏，这个办法难于实现。
    在党总支的鼓励和支持下，车字林一计未成，再生二计。过去架桥的图景，在这个有几十年经验的老桥工的脑子里一幕幕映现出来。他想起了江汉桥用水上吊船拼装的办法，但是又想到那是座公路桥，杆件只有几吨重，而这里，一根预拼好的杆件就有十吨多重。能不能在新的条件下运用这个经验呢？他东奔西跑，到处寻贤访友。工程师帮他计算，测量组帮他测流速，水上联合吊船的工人帮他量扒杆的长度，吊车司机同他一块研究如何吊。由于发挥集体智慧，问题一一解决了。最后，大桥党委决定采纳了这个办法。第一次试吊结果，只用九天就拼好一孔桁梁；后来进一步研究改进，又分别用五天半和五天的时间架好了第三孔、第四孔桁梁。
            智破材料关
    职工们在建桥过程中，还碰到了机具不全、材料不足等许许多多的困难。可是困难越多，越表现了桥工们的无穷智慧。他们先后实现了一万多件革新建议，节约了大批材料、机具和人力。
    建桥开始不久，工地上急需制作三套钢围囹，而现有钢材却只够作两套。
    年青的工程师顾鸿琪为这个问题已经想了很久了，虽然每夜都很迟才睡，可一直没有找到一个好办法。一个深夜，他翻来复去睡不着，一翻身，披着衣服又看起资料来。在翻到河床资料时，他忽然想到五号墩需要更多的钢材，主要是河床岩层低、质软，如果把固定支座移到岩层高、强度大的六号墩来承受制动力，围囹就可减少，这样钢材不就够了么？像在黑暗中忽然发现一线亮光一样，他第二天同大家一商量，同志们都鼓励他，领导上给他很大的支持，许多人又抽业余时间帮他。
    顾鸿琪的建议经过人们多次的讨论、争辩、补充、修正，终于成功了。这项建议，为国家节约了七十多吨钢材、三百多方混凝土和四根管柱，而且大大加快了建桥速度。
    在大桥党委的领导下，人们就是这样群策群力，克服重重困难，用最少的机具、人力和材料，高速优质地在万里长江上架好了第二座大桥。（附图片）
