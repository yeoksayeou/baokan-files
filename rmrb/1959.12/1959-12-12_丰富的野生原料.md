Abundant Wild Raw Materials

In the vast Qinghai Province, wild raw materials for light industry are exceptionally abundant. According to preliminary investigations conducted by the agricultural and forestry departments last year and this year in the eastern agricultural areas and some pastoral areas of Qinghai Province, there are twelve categories of wild economic plant resources, including Chinese medicinal materials, fiber, starch, oil, spices, tannin, dyes, and honey sources, totaling more than 550 species, distributed over an area of more than 20 million mu.

Apocynum, which grows in places such as the Qaidam Basin, is a very good raw material for the textile industry. Its fiber is fine, strong in tensile strength, corrosion-resistant, and moisture-resistant. When blended with wool, it can be woven into high-grade woolen fabrics such as gabardine, valitin, and various colored tweed; when blended with silk and cotton, it can be woven into various gorgeous and durable high-grade silk and cotton fabrics. Its leaves, flowers, stalks, and roots can be used to make tea, paper, medicine, and extract rubber. The natural apocynum fields in the Qaidam Basin alone cover nearly 8 million mu, with an annual output of more than 300 million jin of fiber. Other wild raw materials for the textile industry include roselle, achyranthes, and more than a dozen others.

More than 120 kinds of raw materials for developing the pharmaceutical industry, such as licorice, rhubarb, and fritillary bulbs, have been discovered, covering the pastoral areas of Guoluo, Yushu, Hainan, Haibei, and Huangnan. The reserves of licorice and rhubarb alone amount to about 15 million jin.

There are various raw materials for papermaking, such as stipa, iris, and reeds, with an annual output of about 2 billion jin or more, and they are widely distributed and easy to collect. The output of reeds in the Alar and Utumeiren areas of the Qaidam Basin alone can supply several large-scale paper mills with a daily output of 120 tons of paper.

Other raw materials include spruce, blackthorn, and poplar for manufacturing tannin; ranbus, green oak, and sand bluegrass for manufacturing starch; and more than 60 kinds of oil plants such as camel thorn, maoer thorn, and hazel. According to experimental results, the general oil content is above 10% to 20%, and some are as high as 60%. Raw materials for developing the spice industry are also very abundant, including David's rhododendron (holly), small loquat (fragrant violet), mint, fragrant buds, and more than a dozen others. Other wild economic plants are too numerous to mention. (Li Ying)

    丰富的野生原料
    在地区辽阔的青海省，野生的轻工业原料异常丰富。根据农林部门去年和今年在青海省东部农业区和部分牧业区的初步调查，野生经济植物资源有中药材、纤维、淀粉、油料、香料、栲胶、染料、蜜源等十二类共五百五十多种，分布面积达二千万亩以上。
    在柴达木盆地等处生长着的罗布麻，是纺织工业很好的原料，它的纤维细、拉力强、耐腐、耐湿，和羊毛混纺能织成华达呢、凡尔丁、各色花呢等高级毛纺织品；和丝、棉混纺，又能织成各种华丽耐用的高级丝、棉织品。它的叶子、花、秆、根等可以制茶、造纸、制药和提炼橡胶等。仅柴达木盆地的天然麻田面积即近八百万亩之多，每年可产麻三亿斤以上。其他纺织工业的野生原料，还有浪麻、牛筋条等十几种。
    发展医药工业的甘草、大黄、贝母等原料，已发现了一百二十多种，遍及果洛、玉树、海南、海北、黄南等牧业区。其中仅甘草和大黄的蕴藏量，即达一千五百万斤左右。
    造纸原料有芨芨草、马莲草、芦苇等多种，年产量约在二十亿斤以上，并且分布广，容易采集。仅柴达木盆地阿拉尔和乌图美仁一带的芦苇产量，就可供数座日产一百二十吨纸的大型纸厂之用。
    其他如制造栲胶的原料，有云杉、黑刺、杨树等；制造淀粉的原料，有兰布子、青岗、沙蓬等七种；油料植物有骆驼蓬、毛尔刺、榛子等六十多种，根据试验的结果，一般含油量在10％到20％以上，有高达60％的。发展香料工业的原料也很丰富，有波氏杜鹃（冬青），小枇杷（香紫）、薄荷、香蕾等十多种。其他野生经济植物，不胜枚举。（李瑛）
