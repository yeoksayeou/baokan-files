Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, December 21st: The Mongolian Second Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperative Representatives Congress opened here today. More than six hundred and ninety representatives from all over the country, including cooperative directors, production team leaders, advanced herders, and milkers, attended the meeting.

Mongolian party and government leaders, including Tsedenbal, Sambuu, and Tsende, participated in the opening meeting.

Delegations from nine socialist countries, including the Soviet Union and China, were invited to participate in the meeting.

Tsende, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that this congress would discuss the issue of further consolidating cooperatives and revising the cooperative model charter.

Ragmaa, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia and Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, delivered a report on "The Task of Consolidating Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperatives and Making Certain Amendments and Supplements to the Cooperative Model Charter."

When talking about the development of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, Ragmaa pointed out that currently, 99.3% of herding households nationwide have joined the cooperatives, and 73.3% of livestock have been collectivized. There are 389 cooperatives nationwide, with an average of 475 member households per cooperative, more than 59,000 head of livestock (of which more than 43,000 are collectively owned), and 94 hectares of cultivated land. The production of the cooperatives is continuously developing, and the lives of the members are continuously improving.

He said that the historical significance of agricultural and pastoral collectivization lies in the fact that socialist relations of production have triumphed not only in the cities but also in the pastoral areas, making the broadest masses of herdsmen active participants in socialist construction. The planned development of the national economy will be implemented in livestock production.

He emphasized that the change in organization and the implementation of county-cooperative mergers have played a positive role in consolidating the cooperatives. The important resolution made by the recent Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee on consolidating agricultural and pastoral cooperatives is of great significance for developing production, increasing labor productivity, and improving the living standards of the members.

Ragmaa said that now there are superior conditions for developing agricultural and pastoral production. Scientists' investigations have proved that Mongolian pastures have the conditions to meet the fodder required for increasing the existing livestock by half, so it is necessary to increase livestock. He also said that in order to make good use of the land, it is correct to carry out diversified operations. Among them, animal husbandry still occupies an important position. Agriculture has now become the second major production sector in the Mongolian pastoral areas. In the past five years, the cultivated land of the cooperatives has increased tenfold, accounting for about a quarter of the country's cultivated land area.

Then, the head of the Soviet delegation, Kochubey, and the head of the Chinese delegation, Liao Luyan, delivered congratulatory messages to the congress successively.

Kochubey said that the Soviet people are happy for the great achievements made by the various people's democratic countries. On behalf of the Soviet collective farm members and agricultural workers, he wished the representatives greater achievements in socialist construction.

Liao Luyan said that the Mongolian People's Republic has already achieved brilliant achievements in realizing agricultural and pastoral collectivization and developing agricultural and pastoral production. It is believed that through this congress, agricultural and pastoral cooperatives will be further consolidated and improved, and agriculture and animal husbandry will surely achieve greater development. The Chinese people regard the achievements of the Mongolian people in socialist construction as their own achievements and are delighted.

He said that the fraternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples is constantly developing and strengthening, and cooperation in economy, culture, and science is developing day by day. He said that we want to learn from Mongolia's experience through this congress to develop our country's agricultural and pastoral production.

Their congratulatory messages were met with continuous and warm applause from the audience.

　　蒙古农牧合作社代表大会开幕
    中苏两国代表团团长向大会致贺词
    据新华社乌兰巴托21日电　蒙古第二届农牧业合作社代表大会今天在这里开幕。六百九十多名来自全国各地的合作社主任、生产队长、先进放牧员、挤奶员等出席了会议。
    蒙古党和政府的领导人泽登巴尔、桑布、曾德等参加了开幕会议。
    应邀参加会议的有苏联、中国等九个社会主义国家的代表团。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第二书记曾德致开幕词。他指出，这次大会将要讨论进一步巩固合作社和修改合作社示范章程的问题。
    蒙古部长会议副主席、农牧业部部长热格瓦拉尔在会上作了“关于巩固农牧业合作社的任务和对合作社示范章程进行某些修改补充”的报告。
    热格瓦拉尔在谈到农牧业合作社发展情况时指出，目前，入社牧户已达全国牧户的99.3％，入社牲畜达73.3％。全国有三百八十九个社，每个社平均有四百七十五户社员，五万九千多头牲畜（其中四万三千多头是社有牲畜）和九十四公顷耕地。合作社的生产不断向前发展，社员的生活不断得到改善。
    他说，农牧业合作化的历史意义在于，社会主义生产关系不仅在城市、同时在牧区取得了胜利，使最广大的牧民成为社会主义建设的积极参加者。国民经济有计划的发展将贯彻到牧业生产中去。
    他强调指出，改变组织，实行县社合一对巩固合作社起了良好作用。最近党的四中全会就巩固农牧业合作社作出的重要决议，对发展生产、提高劳动生产率和提高社员的生活水平具有重大意义。
    热格瓦拉尔说，现在已具备了发展农牧业生产的优越条件。科学家的调查证明，蒙古牧场有条件满足比现有牲畜增多一半所必需的饲料，因此必须增殖牲畜。他又说，为了很好地利用土地，进行多种经营是正确的。其中牧业仍占重要地位。农业现在已成为蒙古牧区第二个主要生产部门。五年来合作社的耕地增加到十倍，占全国耕地面积的四分之一左右。
    接着苏联代表团团长科楚博和中国代表团团长廖鲁言先后向大会致了贺词。
    科楚博说，苏联人民为各人民民主国家取得的巨大成就感到高兴。他代表苏联集体农庄庄员和农业工作者预祝代表们在社会主义建设中取得更大的成就。
    廖鲁言说，蒙古人民共和国在实现农牧业合作化和发展农牧业生产方面已经获得光辉的成就。相信通过这次大会农牧业合作社必将获得进一步巩固和提高，农牧业必将获得更大的发展。中国人民把蒙古人民获得的社会主义建设的成就看作是自己的成就，并感到欢欣鼓舞。
    他说，中国人民和蒙古人民兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊正在不断地发展和加强，在经济、文化和科学方面的合作正日益发展。他说，我们要通过这次大会学习蒙古的经验，来发展我国的农牧业生产。
    他们的贺词获得全场不断的热烈掌声。
