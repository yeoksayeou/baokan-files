　　Chongqing, December 24 (Report from this newspaper) – Workers at the Chongqing Radio Factory, in discussing next year's production plan, fully mobilized the masses, calculating both material equipment and sufficiently estimating the subjective initiative of people. They quickly put forward over ten thousand practical and feasible measures, making the plan both advanced and reliable.
    
　　The Chongqing Radio Factory's production tasks for next year are to increase by 50% compared to this year, on the premise of increasing production without increasing manpower. During the factory's initial calculations, they determined that completing next year's production tasks would require a 30% increase in manpower and a doubling of equipment. At this point, a few cadres believed that the large increase in production, without adding equipment or personnel, would make completing the plan difficult. They felt that the new varieties to be added next year had high quality requirements and were technically complex, and that existing technical conditions could not meet the needs, etc. In short, they only looked at existing manpower and equipment conditions, and therefore, the more they calculated, the less confident they became.

　　The factory's Party committee, on the one hand, used the general line and the thought of opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging vigor as the guiding principle, repeatedly educating the workers to establish a concept of continuous revolution. On the other hand, they mobilized workers at all levels, from the factory, workshop, section, team, down to each individual and each machine tool, to carefully calculate the details.

　　First, the workers calculated the benefits of technical innovation and technical revolution, centered on "three-izations" (mechanization of manual labor, automation of mechanical processing, high-speed automation of assembly and testing) and "four reforms" (reforming tools, reforming equipment, reforming technology, reforming design). Before the detailed calculations, the factory had not proposed many measures in this area, including only 191 items related to automation and semi-automation of mechanical processing, and high-speed automation of assembly and testing. As calculations and discussions progressed, the mass movement deepened and enthusiasm grew; in just a few days, over 10,200 innovation projects were proposed. After careful study by the workers, it was estimated that 50% of these projects could be implemented by the first quarter of next year, and all would be implemented by the second quarter. Implementing these innovation projects would increase labor productivity by 85% and equipment utilization by 100%. One product in the factory's first workshop accounts for more than 80% of the annual target for next year. If processed using existing methods, it would require 27 milling machines. However, the workshop only has six usable milling machines, and based on annual production calculations, there would be a shortage of more than 150,000 work hours. This time, after repeated research by leading cadres, veteran workers, and technicians, it was decided to fundamentally change the processing methods. Previously, the main parts and components of this product were sand-casted and then processed using milling machines; this time, it was decided to use precision casting and die-casting methods, which would reduce the manufacturing time for one component from 30 hours to 1.5 to 2 hours.

　　The second calculation was about labor. In this area, in addition to proposing many innovation projects, the workers also proposed suggestions for rationally adjusting labor organization and strengthening quota management. According to preliminary calculations, these suggestions, once implemented, could save 13.4% of the labor force next year. The fifth workshop produces radios. Originally, the labor force in each process was not balanced, affecting the connection between upstream and downstream processes. The technical proficiency of workers in each type of work varied greatly, the operations were not standardized, and labor efficiency was low, resulting in a monthly production of only 3,000 radios. During the discussion, after organizing veteran workers and technicians to check each worker's operation and summarizing the advanced operating methods into new operating procedures for workers to learn; and at the same time, by means of technical verification, rationally defining staffing and quotas, the existing labor potential was greatly tapped, and production efficiency could be increased by more than double.

　　The third calculation was about the potential of equipment. To meet next year's production needs, the factory's equipment capacity needs to be doubled, especially the lack of bakelite molding machines, punch presses, milling machines, and vertical winding machines. During the discussion, the workers tried every possible means to improve equipment utilization. The workers in the ninth workshop, focusing on the weak link of insufficient bakelite molding machines, adopted a two-pronged approach of improving equipment and improving technology. On the one hand, they changed the bakelite molding machines from processing one bakelite part per layer to processing two bakelite parts simultaneously on two layers, doubling production efficiency; on the other hand, they improved the molds for processing bakelite parts. Originally, one mold could only press one part; now, one mold can press two to five parts.

　　Through detailed calculations, the thought of continuous leap forward has been further firmly established among the factory's workers. The factory has achieved "three clarifications" in everyone's thinking (clarifying targets, clarifying key points, clarifying measures), and everyone has established action plans for continuous leap forward. The workers have high ambitions and strong drive. They are discussing, planning, and immediately taking action. Currently, 139 major technical innovation suggestions have already been implemented throughout the factory.

　　重庆无线电厂算细账挖潜力充分发挥主观能动作用
    跃进思想产生跃进计划
    上万条革新建议保证明年生产计划既先进又可靠
    本报重庆24日电　重庆无线电厂职工在讨论明年生产计划时，充分发动群众，既算物质设备账，又足够地估计了人的主观能动作用，很快提出了上万条切实可行的措施，使计划订得既先进又可靠。
    重庆无线电厂在增产不增人的前提下，明年的生产任务要比今年增长50％。厂里第一次算账的时候，算来算去，要完成明年生产任务，需要增加人力30％，增添一倍的设备。这时，少数干部认为增产幅度大，不添设备不增人，完成计划是困难的。认为明年增加的新品种质量要求高，技术复杂，现有技术条件不能适应需要等等。总之，他们只看现有人力，设备条件，因此，账越算下去，信心越不足。
    这个厂的党委，一方面以总路线和反右倾鼓干劲的思想为纲，反复教育职工树立不断革命的思想；另一方面，层层发动职工，从工厂、车间、工段、小组、直到每一个人和每一台机床，认真地算了一下细账。
    首先，职工们算了以“三化”（手工机械化、机械加工自动化、总装调试高速化）、“四改”（改工具、改设备、改工艺、改设计）为中心的技术革新和技术革命的账。在未算细账以前，这个厂在这方面提出的措施不多，包括机械加工自动化、半自动化和总装调试高速化等共计只有一百九十一项。边算账边讨论，群众运动越深入，情绪就越高；短短几天，就提出了一万零二百多项革新项目。经过职工们的仔细研究，这些项目预计到明年一季度可实现50％，二季度可全部实现。实现这些革新项目后，劳动生产率可提高85％，设备利用率可提高一倍。这个厂的第一车间有一种产品，产量占明年全年任务的80％以上，若按现有方法加工，需要二十七台铣床；但车间能够用的铣床只有六台，按全年生产工业计算，还差十五万多个工时。这次，经过领导干部、老工人和技术人员一起反复研究后，决定从根本上改变加工方法。原来制造这种产品的主要零、部件是经过翻砂后再用铣床加工；这次讨论改用精密铸造和模具压铸法加工，一件部件的制作时间就可由三十小时缩短为一小时半到两小时。
    第二笔是算劳动力的账。这方面，职工们除了提出许多革新项目外，还提出了合理调整劳动组织、加强定额定员工作的建议。据初步计算，这些建议实现以后，明年内可节省劳动力13.4％。五车间生产收音机，原来各个工序的劳动力不够平衡，影响上下工序之间的衔接；各工种工人的技术熟练程度相差悬殊，操作也不统一，劳动效率低，每月只能生产三千台收音机。在讨论中，经过组织老工人和技术人员查定每个工人的操作，并把先进的操作方法加以总结，纳入新的操作规程，组织工人学习；同时通过技术查定，合理地定员定额，大大挖掘了现有劳动潜力，可提高生产效率一倍以上。
    第三笔是算设备潜力的账。全厂要满足明年的生产需要，设备能力还需增添一倍，其中特别是胶木机、冲床、铣床、立线机等缺少很多。职工们在讨论中，千方百计提高设备利用率。九车间的职工针对胶木机不足的薄弱环节，便采用改进设备和改进工艺双管齐下的办法，一面将胶木机由原来一机一层加工一个胶木件，改为一机双层同时加工两个胶木件，生产效率提高一倍；一面又改进加工胶木件的模具。原来一个模具只能压一件，现在可用一个模具压二件到五件。
    通过算细账，继续跃进的思想在全厂职工中进一步牢固地树立起来了。全厂做到了人人思想上“三明确”（明确指标、明确关键、明确措施），个个订立了继续跃进的行动规划。职工们的志气高，干劲猛。他们边讨论，边规划，并且马上动手干。目前，全厂已经实现的重大技术革新建议已有一百三十九项。
