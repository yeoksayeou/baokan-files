　　Winter is the best season to develop diversified economy. A well-developed diversified economy can not only ensure a greater increase in this year's total agricultural output value and a greater increase in the income of commune members, but also accumulate more funds for striving for a greater agricultural harvest next year.

　　How can we do a good job in the diversified economy in winter? The key lies in leadership, in the scientific and rational organization and use of labor, so that people can make the best use of their talents and resources can be fully utilized.

　　There are many production tasks in winter, including not only developing a diversified economy, but also engaging in large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, as well as strengthening the management of overwintering crops and short-distance transportation. Therefore, if the various tasks are not arranged well, the phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another will occur: either focusing on diversified economy and affecting water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, or engaging in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation and abandoning diversified economy and other tasks. What should we do? The practice of Jiangpu County is very good. Under the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, they rationally allocate labor, ensuring the successful completion of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation tasks, and also allocate a certain amount of manpower to diversified economy. Experience has proved that as long as the manpower is well organized, skillfully arranged, and properly used, four people can play the role of five or six.

　　In the large-scale development of diversified economy in winter, Jiangpu County adopted eight specific measures to organize and use labor, and achieved great results. The methods of Jiangpu County in developing diversified economy provide us with two important experiences:

　　First, fully promote democracy, assign tasks to the masses, mobilize the masses to discuss and solve the contradiction between developing diversified economy and insufficient labor, and strive to utilize all available labor and combine all possible production activities to develop diversified economy. China has a vast territory and abundant resources for developing diversified economy. Some of these resources are large and concentrated, while others are scattered; some require the organization of professional teams to operate, while others can be combined with water conservancy construction, field management, and other production activities. The responsibility of the leadership lies in organizing the masses to take action and combine the specialized teams of diversified economy with mass actions. In this way, diversified economy can be developed more widely, output value can be expanded, and income can be increased.

　　Second, give full play to the role of professional teams. According to the importance and urgency of diversified economic projects, the strength of labor, the difficulty of operation, and the different technical requirements, organize professional teams to do things according to the time, place, work, and people. Assign heavy work to people with strong labor, assign light work to people with weak labor, and assign technically demanding work to people with technical expertise. Giving full play to everyone's strengths, displaying everyone's abilities, and using each labor force in a more appropriate place can greatly improve work efficiency.

　　Now is the busy season of winter production. Rationally and comprehensively arranging labor and giving better play to the role of each labor force will surely enable us to complete all our winter production tasks more and better.

    人尽其力　力尽其用
    姜韦才
    冬季是开展多种经营最好的季节。多种经营开展得好，不仅可以保证今年农业总产值有更大的增长，社员的收入有更大的增加，而且可以为争取明年农业更大丰收积累更多的资金。
    怎样才能把冬季的多种经营搞得好？关键在于领导，在于科学地合理地组织与使用劳力，使之人尽其力，力尽其用。
    冬季生产任务很多，既要搞好多种经营，也要大搞水利、积肥，还要加强越冬作物管理，以及短途运输等等。因此，对各项任务安排不好，就会发生顾此失彼现象：不是抓了多种经营，影响了水利、积肥；就是搞了水利、积肥，丢了多种经营及其它。怎么办呢？江浦县的做法很好，他们在统筹兼顾的原则下，合理地分配劳动力，既保证水利、积肥等任务胜利完成，也给多种经营拨出一定的人力。经验证明，只要把人力组织得好，安排得巧，使用得当，四个人就能起五、六个人的作用。
    江浦县在大搞冬季多种经营中，采取了八项具体办法组织与使用劳力，获得很大成绩。江浦县开展多种经营的方法，给我们提供了两条重要经验：
    一是充分发扬民主，把任务交给群众，发动群众讨论与解决开展多种经营与劳力不足的矛盾，做到利用一切可以利用的劳力、结合一切可以结合的生产活动开展多种经营。我国幅员广阔，开展多种经营的资源十分丰富。这些资源，有的是大量集中的，有的是零星分散的；有的需要组织专业队经营，有的可以结合兴修水利、田间管理等其它生产活动进行。领导的责任就在于组织群众，人人动手，使多种经营专业队和群众性的行动结合起来。这样就能更广泛地开展多种经营，扩大产值，增加收入。
    二是充分发挥专业队的作用。根据多种经营项目的轻重缓急、劳力强弱、操作难易和技术要求不同等情况，组织专业队因时、因地、因活、因人制宜地去做。对于劳动力强的人，分配重活；劳力弱的人，分配轻活；技术性较强的工作，应当分配有技术专长的人去做。充分发挥每个人的长处，施展每个人的本领，把每个劳动力用在较恰当的地方，就能大大提高工效。
    现在正是冬季生产繁忙的季节，合理地全面地安排好劳动力，更好地发挥每个劳动力的作用，一定会使我们全部的冬季生产任务完成得更多更好。
