　　Generally, the mating period is best around noon the next day,
　　Morning mating often results in more pregnancies, evening mating is often ineffective.
　　Double mating and repeated mating produce more, stronger piglets.
　　Artificial insemination is scientific and convenient,
　　Improving the pregnancy rate, resulting in uniform and strong piglets.
