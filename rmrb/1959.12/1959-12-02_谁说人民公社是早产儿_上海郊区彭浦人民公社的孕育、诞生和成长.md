    Who Says the People's Commune Was a Premature Infant?
    – The Gestation, Birth, and Growth of the Pengpu People's Commune in the Suburbs of Shanghai
    Wei Keming, Ji Jingfeng, Liu Zhengui

    September 27, 1958, was the day the Pengpu People's Commune in Tangnan Township, Baoshan County, Shanghai, was established. This newborn "infant" had already begun its gestation period several months earlier. September 27th was merely the day it matured and was born with a cry. Contrary to what the right-leaning opportunists said, the People's Commune was not a "premature infant" but was conceived for ten months and fell ripe from the vine.

    The Gestation Period

    After the high tide of cooperativization in 1956 and the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front in 1957, productivity was further liberated, and people's demands for changing the backward state of production and life became more urgent. It was at this time that the farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai, inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction, put forward an ambitious fighting slogan: "Strive for 100 jin of cotton (lint), 1,000 jin of grain, and 10,000 jin of vegetables per mu." They were determined to accelerate the speed of production development and better implement the policy of serving the city through suburban agricultural production.

    Tangnan Township in Baoshan County is a vegetable production area, and "10,000 jin of vegetables per mu" became their primary goal. However, the township's vegetable yield per mu in 1957 was only 7,000 jin. To reach 10,000 jin per mu, production needed to increase by more than 40% on the existing basis. To pluck this leaping "10,000 jin per mu" fruit, it was necessary to undertake large-scale agricultural capital construction, especially large-scale water conservancy projects, purchase necessary agricultural machinery and modern transportation tools, and establish large-scale factories to serve agricultural production... However, the advanced cooperatives at that time could not independently undertake these urgent tasks in terms of manpower, materials, or financial resources. A series of contradictions unfolded from then on.

    Vegetables are "delicate" crops and require more water. To meet the water needs of vegetables and facilitate the transportation of fertilizers and vegetables, two rivers in Tangnan Township needed to be dredged urgently, one called "Pengyuepu" and the other called "Luojingpu." Once these two rivers were cleared, 40% of the township's land could be better irrigated. However, these two rivers were both "cross-cooperative rivers." The former crossed the areas of Pioneer First Cooperative and Second Cooperative, while the latter passed through the land of Pioneer First Cooperative, Third Cooperative, and Fourth Cooperative. Without unified leadership and planning, no advanced cooperative could cross cooperative boundaries to clear these two rivers. Moreover, the dredging project was large, and the manpower and materials required were beyond the capacity of any single advanced cooperative. What to do? Should the boundaries of the advanced cooperatives restrict people's activities, allowing vegetables to lack water and settling for low yields? Or should they break through cooperative boundaries, clear the rivers, let vegetables drink their fill, and strive for 10,000 jin per mu?

    A heated debate unfolded in the advanced cooperatives on this issue. In Pioneer First Cooperative, some wealthy middle peasants, represented by Chen Tangen, proposed that these two rivers were "official rivers" and should be repaired by the government. The broad masses of peasants disagreed with this opinion. Poor peasant Cheng Linxiang criticized Chen Tangen, saying, "You're like an eel dropped into a soup pot – uneasy in your heart." People unanimously demanded breaking through ideological constraints, breaking through cooperative boundaries, and relying on their own strength to clear these two "official rivers." Thus, initiated by Pioneer First Cooperative and under the unified leadership of the Tangnan Township Party Committee, a rally was held before the Spring Festival to pledge the start of river clearing. On the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year, before dawn, more than 3,000 water conservancy troops arrived at the construction site. Workers, urban residents, students, and nearby troops returning home for the festival also automatically came to participate. Workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers were mobilized, and the eleven advanced cooperatives cooperated on a large scale. The progress of the project was exceptionally rapid. The "Pengyuepu," originally planned to be completed in two weeks, saw flowing boats in just seven days. The "Luojingpu," originally planned to be dredged in seven days, was also officially completed four days ahead of schedule.

    The two "official rivers" were cleared, the irrigated area expanded, and people's thinking also underwent new changes. They felt that advanced cooperatives were no longer adapted to the requirements of the Great Leap Forward. For the sake of the Great Leap Forward, the boundaries of the advanced cooperatives could not restrict their actions. It was necessary to broaden their horizons and find new ways out.

    At this time, five smaller advanced cooperatives with more difficulties, influenced by breaking through cooperative boundaries and undertaking large-scale water conservancy projects, were actively seeking new ways out. These five advanced cooperatives each had their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Taishan Cooperative was very developed in sideline occupations, famous for pig farming, but lacked funds to buy piglets and build pig sheds. Huayuan Cooperative mainly grew flowers and plants, had more surplus and sufficient funds, but was very short of labor. On average, each laborer had to manage more than three mu of land and could not take care of it all. Zhuxiang Cooperative had surplus labor but insufficient land, and cooperative members were often idle at home with nothing to do. In short, each had its own difficulties and felt that a small cooperative could not handle big things.

    As early as the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in 1956, these five cooperatives had jointly requested to merge into a large cooperative. At that time, the township government did not approve them because they "lacked experience in running a large cooperative." Later, the directors of these five cooperatives automatically organized a "research group" and frequently met to exchange experiences. They often discussed, "One day, we will merge."

    In May 1958, when Tangnan Township held a Great Leap Forward rally, the cadres of these five advanced cooperatives met again. "One palm cannot clap, and a small cooperative cannot handle big things. Our only way out is to unite and run a large cooperative." Inspired by the Great Leap Forward situation, the director of Huayuan Cooperative raised the old issue again. This time, the initiative was not only approved by the other cooperative directors, but also aroused enthusiastic responses among the broad masses of cooperative members through them. From homes to fields, discussions were everywhere, and cooperative members became clearer and clearer through discussion. As cooperative member Tao Jintao said, "For the Great Leap Forward, there is only one way, to unite." However, when everyone was excited, many cooperative members of Taishan Cooperative felt uneasy. They thought: Huayuan Cooperative has tens of thousands of yuan in the bank, while our cooperative owes several thousand yuan in debt. The poor are poor, and the rich are rich. How can we "unite"? When the cooperative members of Huayuan Cooperative learned of this, they sent representatives to talk to them, explaining that running a large cooperative could provide mutual support and common development, which would benefit everyone. The cooperative members of Taishan Cooperative were even more overjoyed after hearing this. After obtaining approval from the township government, the five cooperatives united on June 1 and formally established the "Huayuan United Cooperative." After the establishment of the United Cooperative, each cooperative learned from each other's strengths, helped each other, and, based on the specific circumstances of each cooperative and the principle of mutual benefit, concentrated a portion of funds for unified use, established a farm tool repair station, and built a canteen. Not only did the scope of the cooperative expand, but the "public" component also increased. The embryo of the People's Commune was gradually taking shape.

    Similar components of collective ownership of the commune also existed throughout the township. Originally, the cadres and cooperative members of all advanced cooperatives in the township had a common belief: "One day, the entire township will unite to run a large cooperative." To facilitate contact and further cultivate the concept of a large collective, all cooperatives in the township pooled funds to run a fairly large-scale dairy farm with more than 40 dairy cows, collectively owned by each cooperative. It was determined that dividends would not be distributed temporarily in order to accelerate development. They called this dairy farm a "seed" and a "fuse." Although the peasants at that time did not yet know the name "People's Commune," the "seed" of the People's Commune had already sprouted, and the "fuse" uniting all advanced cooperatives already existed.

    However, when this "seed" had not yet grown, blossomed, and borne fruit, the contradiction between the original advanced cooperatives and the situation of the Great Leap Forward could not be fundamentally resolved.

    As the high tide of the Great Leap Forward developed wave after wave, in the vegetable production area, it was not only necessary to achieve the "10,000 jin per mu" target, but also to increase the variety of vegetables to meet the diverse needs of the people; it was not only necessary to complete the annual leap forward target, but also to ensure balanced supply, so as to achieve "no slack season and even busier peak season"; it was not only necessary to increase vegetable production, but also to achieve comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. To complete these tasks, it was necessary to invest more labor. And the lack of labor became a prominent contradiction.

    At that time, the state tractor station and pumping station sent several tractors and pumps to Tangnan Township to help with plowing and pumping. The peasants were very excited to see that "plowing does not require cattle," and felt that this was the best way to save labor and achieve the Great Leap Forward. Thus, they demanded that the advanced cooperatives purchase agricultural machinery, and some production teams even wrote big-character posters and sent them to the cooperative. But one request after another received the same answer: "Our cooperative is small, and our economic strength is not enough. We cannot afford it yet."

    The rapid development of agricultural production urgently required the cooperative to establish factories to serve agricultural production, especially farm tool factories, to add necessary farm tools and repair damaged farm tools at any time. In May and June 1958, the vegetable fields of Pioneer Second Cooperative suddenly suffered a serious insect plague. More than 100 sprayers in the cooperative were damaged a lot due to continuous use day and night, and urgently needed to be repaired. Repairing it one hour earlier could save a portion of vegetables from the mouths of insects. However, this advanced cooperative only had a small factory with very simple equipment and three people. What role could it play? The cooperative members had to take the sprayers to the farm tool repair factory more than five miles away to ask someone to repair them, but the factory also had a heavy workload at that time. The cooperative members were very heartbroken to see the vegetables being eaten by insects and discussed it. Gan Sifu, Xu Jindi, Zhang Jinlin and others discussed long-term solutions together, and their unanimous conclusion was: "It would be easier if the cooperatives united." The township government also considered organizing the strength of each cooperative to run a large farm tool repair factory, and had borrowed two lathes, but after several consultations, the matter was dropped because the opinions of each cooperative were different, especially the issue of "who should lead" could not be resolved.

    With the increase in vegetable production, the volume of transportation also increased greatly. The cooperative members responsible for transportation could only transport once from twelve o'clock at midnight to eight o'clock in the morning, back and forth more than forty miles, with high labor intensity and still unable to complete the task. Fighting against natural disasters is like fighting a war. Sometimes it is necessary to concentrate superior forces to solve certain battles of decisive significance, otherwise, serious losses will be suffered. Vegetables are "delicate" crops, and this need is even more urgent. Before cooperativization, during a frost attack, seven out of ten vegetables were frozen to death overnight. Many peasants cried bitterly, deeply feeling the pain that the individual economy could not withstand wind and rain. Although this situation has greatly changed since the establishment of advanced cooperatives, it has not been fundamentally resolved. The cooperative members are often worried about this. They feel that without cooperation on a larger scale, it is difficult to overcome natural disasters and achieve the "10,000 jin per mu" target.

    For the sake of the great development of production, the broad masses of peasants were eagerly looking forward to breaking through the boundaries of advanced cooperatives and uniting to run large cooperatives.

    Ripe Fruit Falls from the Vine

    At this time, the cadres and cooperative members of each advanced cooperative were looking for new ways out everywhere. They went to Pudong, to Changshu, to Xiaogan and Macheng in Hubei, to "learn from experience" everywhere for the Great Leap Forward.

    In July 1958, a group of grassroots cadres from various counties in the suburbs of Shanghai went to Suiping and Xinxiang in Henan to visit. Chen Changgen, the director of Pioneer First Cooperative, also went to represent Tangnan Township. As soon as they arrived at their destination, they heard a new term: "People's Commune," and heard and saw many benefits of the People's Commune. Chen Changgen saw it in his eyes and was happy in his heart, deeply feeling the power of the People's Commune. As soon as he returned to Shanghai, he immediately promoted it everywhere. The news of the establishment of communes in Henan quickly spread throughout Tangnan Township through cooperative-level and team-level introductions. The cooperative members were overjoyed after hearing this and felt that there was great hope. From then on, wherever the cadres went, the cooperative members would follow up and ask, "When will we establish a People's Commune?"

    At this time, the resolution of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on the establishment of People's Communes in rural areas was announced, and the cooperative members of Tangnan Township were even more elated. Each cooperative and team universally discussed it and demanded the establishment of a commune as soon as possible. The cooperative members were busy with deep plowing during the day and writing applications and big-character posters at night to apply to join the commune. Within a few days, nearly 10,000 big-character posters and letters of determination were sent to the township. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were particularly eager to join the commune. Most of the upper-middle peasants, because they had benefited from collectivization, also wrote big-character posters applying to join the commune. An old woman named Yao Jieshe, who had been working alone since the mutual aid group, also applied to join the commune this time after hearing that "eating is free" after the establishment of the commune. Only a few people who were satisfied with the status quo妄想妄想 to stop this surging tide. Wealthy middle peasant Chen Quangen was a representative. He said during the discussion of establishing a People's Commune: "The advanced cooperative is very good. Why establish a People's Commune? I don't think it's a good idea to establish one." But this opinion was immediately refuted by everyone. Yang Genxing, who had been a long-term worker in the old society for many years, said: "That's right, the elementary cooperative is better than the mutual aid group, and the advanced cooperative is better than the elementary cooperative, but the People's Commune is even better than the advanced cooperative." At the same time, the masses repeatedly explained that participation in the commune was voluntary, and no one who did not want to participate would be forced. Chen Quangen and others were inspired and educated by everyone and canceled their plan to "stop halfway," asking to join the commune. After a candid debate, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members to establish a People's Commune became even higher, and their spirits became even more invigorated.

    On September 27, the Pengpu People's Commune was formally born like a mature infant. On this day, a grand founding meeting was held, with more than 10,000 people participating in the celebration parade. They beat gongs and drums, held high red flags, waved dragon lanterns, and carried achievement boards with drawings and writings of the achievements they had created to welcome the commune. Along the way, the cooperative members shouted slogans such as "Long live the Chinese Communist Party" and "Long live Chairman Mao." This enthusiastic scene could never be "stirred up" by anyone. The right-leaning opportunists said that "the People's Commune was created by the Communist Party." In fact, the Communist Party only played a "midwifery" role, making the mature "infant" born smoothly.

    Incomparable Vitality

    As soon as the People's Commune was established, it immediately showed incomparable vitality. Many contradictions that could not be resolved during the advanced cooperative period were gradually resolved, or began to be resolved.

    For the Great Leap Forward, the desire of the broad masses of cooperative members to purchase agricultural machinery and modern transportation tools began to be realized, and the contradiction of insufficient labor was better resolved. Because the People's Commune exerted the superiority of "large scale and high degree of public ownership," possessing more funds, they were moving towards the goal of agricultural mechanization. Now, Pengpu Commune has 19 large and small tractors, 45 pumps (including an artificial rain station), 8 transport vehicles, as well as modern electric sprayers and electric incubators. When these machines began to be used, the cooperative members were very excited, vying to send tea and night snacks to the tractor drivers. The use of these agricultural machinery played a huge role in promoting the development of production and improving people's working conditions. According to statistics from January to August 1959: tractors have plowed more than 4,000 mu of land, and cars transport an average of more than 1,800 dan of vegetables every day. These two items alone have saved more than 90,000 man-days. In the summer, the suburbs of Shanghai encountered rare drought and extreme heat for decades, with temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius for more than ten days. Five mu of cabbage land in Tangnan Production Team could not be watered by machines due to the high terrain. Although more than 30 man-days were spent rushing to water six times, it still all died from the drought. Other vegetable fields, due to the pumping machines irrigating day and night, all achieved bumper harvests. Seeing the vegetables green in the scorching sun, the cooperative members said, "The People's Commune has made a great contribution."

    For the Great Leap Forward, the desire of the cooperative members to run large-scale factories serving agricultural production has also been realized. After communization, they implemented the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and actively developed commune-run industries. In the past year, they have newly established ten large and small factories, merged and expanded the original four farm tool repair and assembly stations, and established the Pioneer Agricultural Machinery Factory with more than 100 workers. The factory now has four drilling machines, two metal planers, one woodworking saw, one woodworking planer, a set of molding equipment, and a pig iron furnace. The factory has a completely new look, with casting, forging, welding, lathe, fitter, planer, electrical and other types of work. It can not only repair and assemble agricultural machinery and transportation tools such as water pumps and automobiles, but also manufacture feed crushers and portable electric welders. Recently, it has successfully trial-produced feed cutters, cotton seeders, and soybean seeders. With the active support and help of urban workers, they have cultivated a group of "native experts" and technicians.

    For the Great Leap Forward, the desire of the cooperative members to implement cooperation on a larger scale has also been realized. Large-scale cooperation has exerted tremendous power and overcome difficulties that were difficult to overcome in the past. In early January 1959, a rare cold wave struck the suburbs of Shanghai. After inspection, it was found that Tangnan Production Team had more than 1,000 mu of vegetables that had not been covered with rice straw because of insufficient manpower and rice straw. They were in danger of freezing to death. The People's Commune issued an emergency mobilization order, and workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers were fully mobilized, mobilizing more than 30 cars and tractors inside and outside the commune to rush rice straw overnight. Many cooperative members from various teams ate dinner early and ran from ten or eight miles away to provide support. Inspired by this spirit of communist cooperation, the cooperative members of Tangnan Team worked even harder. In less than six hours, before the cold wave arrived, they had rushed to harvest more than 20,000 dan of vegetables and covered more than 1,000 mu of vegetables with rice straw. Despite the fact that this cold air reached minus eight degrees Celsius, the vegetables here were safe and sound. The cooperative members saw the power of the People's Commune from this struggle to overcome the cold wave, and they composed poems to praise:

    Big boats are not afraid of waves,
    Many people are not afraid of cold weather,
    Five-in-one leap forward together,
    The power of the commune is boundless.

    Because the People's Commune has solved and is solving a series of contradictions, showing greater superiority than advanced cooperatives, agricultural production has achieved high-speed development. The vegetable yield per mu of the commune has broken through the 10,000 jin mark, exceeding its leap forward target. The yield per mu in 1958 reached more than 11,000 jin, and from January to August 1959, calculated by the amount of market supply, the average yield per mu has reached more than 8,600 jin, an increase of 28.6% compared with the same period in 1958; and it has achieved "evergreen in all seasons, balanced supply"; the variety of vegetables is also becoming more complete. The commune has built 141 new greenhouses. Even in the cold winter months, the room is still full of red tomatoes, green cucumbers, purple eggplants, and white mushrooms...

    In the past year, diversified operations have also developed greatly. As soon as the commune was established, each production team built pig sheds and developed pig farming. Currently, the average number of pigs raised per household is 4.4. The total number of meat pigs put on the market by the entire commune in the first half of 1959 is equal to the total number of meat pigs put on the market in the entire year of 1958. The number of chickens and ducks raised in 1959 has increased nearly six times compared with 1958. As the cooperative members describe it, now everywhere is "vegetable gardens are full, pig and sheep pens are full, chickens and ducks are in flocks, and ponds are full of fish."

    With the development of production, the lives of the cooperative members have also been significantly improved. The average annual income of each peasant is as follows:

    1949 55 yuan
    1957 90 yuan
    1958 129 yuan
    1959 (estimated) 160 yuan

    That is to say, the estimated income of each peasant in 1959 increased by 24% compared with 1958, 78% compared with 1957, and 1.91 times compared with 1949.

    The accumulation of the commune is also increasing day by day, and it has now reached 2.05 million yuan, of which 440,000 yuan belongs to commune ownership (the rest belongs to production team ownership). This is the seed of greater happiness for the people.

    Two of the six production teams belonging to this commune have implemented the food supply system, and four teams have implemented the grain supply system. A new peasant village of approximately 10,000 square meters will be built in the autumn of 1959, including public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, department stores, health stations, and broadcast rooms. When cooperative member Lu Chunlin moved into the new village, the more he thought about it, the more excited he became. He said, "I lived in a thatched hut for 43 years without a tile on my head. I didn't expect to move into such a brand new tiled house just one year after the commune was established." He saw the children happily rolling on the floor and didn't know what to say to the people who came to visit. Thousands of words were summed up in one sentence: "The People's Commune is good."

    The superiority of the People's Commune has only just begun to show its sharpness, and such huge changes have taken place here. If the People's Commune is a "premature infant," then please ask: how can an organization with "congenital deficiency" exert such great power?

    谁说人民公社是早产儿
    ——上海郊区彭浦人民公社的孕育、诞生和成长
    魏克明　吉景峰　刘振贵
    1958年9月27日，是上海市宝山县塘南乡彭浦人民公社成立的日子。这个初生的“婴儿”，在几个月以前就开始了它的孕育时期，9月27日这一天，不过是孕育成熟，呱呱坠地罢了。和右倾机会主义分子所说的相反，人民公社不是什么“早产儿”，而是怀胎十月，瓜熟蒂落。
    孕育期
    经过1956年合作化的高潮和1957年政治思想战线上社会主义革命的胜利，生产力获得进一步的解放，人们对改变生产上生活上落后状态的要求，更加迫切了。正是在这个时候，上海郊区农民，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，提出了一个雄心勃勃的战斗口号：“争取亩产百斤棉（皮棉），千斤粮，万斤菜。”他们决心加快生产发展的速度，并更好地贯彻郊区农业生产为城市服务的方针。
    宝山县塘南乡是蔬菜产区，“亩产万斤菜”就成为他们奋斗的主要目标。可是，这个乡1957年蔬菜的亩产量只有七千斤，要达到亩产万斤，就需要在原有的基础上增产40％以上。要摘下这个“亩产万斤”的跃进果子，就需要举办较大规模的农业基本建设，特别是大兴水利，需要购置必要的农业机械和现代化的运输工具，需要兴办规模较大的为农业生产服务的工厂……。但是，当时的高级社无论在人力、物力、财力方面，都不可能单独担负这些迫切的任务，一系列的矛盾从此展开。
    蔬菜是“娇生”的作物，需要更多的水分。为了满足蔬菜对水分的需要和便利肥料、蔬菜的运输，当时塘南乡有两条河流亟待疏浚，一条叫“彭越浦”，一条叫“罗泾浦”。这两条河流疏通了，全乡40％的土地可以得到更好的灌溉。可是，这两条河都是“跨社河”，前者横跨先锋一社、二社两个高级社的地区，后者穿过先锋一社、三社、四社三个高级社的土地，没有统一的领导和规划，任何一个高级社都不可能越出社界把这两条河修通。何况疏浚的工程较大，所需要的人力、物力，也不是任何一个高级社所能负担得起的。怎样办？是让高级社的社界限制死人们的活动范围，听任蔬菜缺水，安于低产的状况；还是冲破社界，修通河流，让蔬菜喝足，力争亩产万斤？
    对这个问题，在高级社里展开了热烈的辩论。在先锋一社，以陈谈根为代表的某些富裕中农提出：这两条河是“官河”，应该让政府来修。广大农民不同意这种意见。贫农程林祥批评陈谈根说：“你不要鳗鱼掉在汤锅里——心里不舒直。”人们一致要求冲破思想束缚，冲破社界，依靠自己的力量，修通这两条“官河”。于是，由先锋一社发起，在塘南乡党委统一领导下，于春节前夕举行了开河的誓师大会。大年初一的早晨，天还未亮，三千多名水利大军就来到工地，回家过节的工人、城镇居民、学生和附近驻军也自动赶来参加，工、农、商、学、兵齐出动，十一个高级社大协作，工程的进展异常迅速，原计划两星期完工的“彭越浦”，只有七天就流水行舟；原计划七天疏通的“罗泾浦”，也提前四天正式完工。
    两条“官河”修通了，灌溉面积扩大了，人们的思想也起了新的变化，感到高级社已经不能适应生产大跃进的要求。为了大跃进，不能让高级社的界线束缚住自己的手脚，需要放开眼界，寻找新的出路。
    这时，有五个范围较小、困难较多的高级社，受到冲破社界、大兴水利的影响，正在为寻找新的出路而积极活动。这五个高级社各有各的长处，也各有各的短处。如泰山社副业很发达，以养猪著名，但资金缺乏，买不起猪苗，盖不起猪棚。花园社主要是种花草，盈余较多，资金较足，但劳动力很缺乏，平均每个劳动力要经营三亩多地，照顾不来。朱巷社劳动力有余，而土地不足，社员常常闲在家里，无活可干。总之，各有各的苦处，都感到社小不能办大事。
    早在1956年农业合作化高潮的时候，这五个社就曾联名要求联合起来办大社。当时乡政府以他们“缺乏办大社的经验”，没有批准。后来这五个社主任自动组织了一个“研究小组”，经常碰头交流经验，他们常常议论：“总有一天，要合并起来的。”
    1958年5月，塘南乡举行跃进誓师大会时，这五个高级社的干部又碰在一起了。“一只手掌拍不响，一个小社难办大事情，我们的出路只有一条，联合起来办大社。”在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，花园社社主任又提出了老问题。这次的倡议，不仅得到其他几个社主任的赞同，而且通过他们在广大社员中也引起了热烈的反应。从家中到田头，到处纷纷议论，社员们越议论越明确。正像社员陶金桃所说的：“要大跃进，只有联合起来这一条路。”可是，当大家兴高采烈的时候，泰山社的许多社员心中却七上八下，他们想：人家花园社有几万元存在银行里，自己的社却欠了几千元的债，穷的穷，富的富，怎么能“联合起来”？花园社的社员知道了，就派代表去和他们谈心，说明办大社可以互相支援，共同发展，对大家都有好处。泰山社的社员们听了，更是喜出望外。在得到乡政府批准以后，6月1日，五个社联合起来，正式成立了“花园联社”。联社成立后，各社之间取长补短，互相帮助，并根据各社的具体情况和互利的原则，集中了一部分资金，统一使用，办了一个农具修理站，建了一所食堂。不仅社的范围扩大了，而且“公”的成分也有增长，人民公社的胚胎正在逐步形成。
    类似公社集体所有制的成分，在全乡范围内也是存在的。原来全乡各高级社的干部和社员，早有一个共同的信念：“总有一天，要全乡联合起来办大社。”为了便于联系和进一步培养大集体的观念，全乡各社集资办了一个具有相当规模的奶牛场，有四十多头奶牛，作为各社集体所有，并确定暂时不分红，以便加速发展。他们称这个奶牛场为“种子”，为“引线”。当时农民们虽然还不知道“人民公社”这个名称，但人民公社的“种子”已经萌芽，把各高级社联合起来的“引线”已经存在了。
    然而，当这颗“种子”尚未发育成长，开花结果的时候，原高级社和大跃进形势不相适应的矛盾，是无法求得根本解决的。
    随着大跃进的高潮一浪推一浪地向前发展，在蔬菜产区，不仅要实现“亩产万斤”的指标，而且要增加蔬菜的品种，满足人民各种不同的需要；不仅要完成全年的跃进指标，而且要保证均衡的供应，做到“淡季不淡，旺季更旺”；不仅要增产蔬菜，而且要农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展。为了完成这些任务，就需要付出更多的劳动力。而劳动力不足，就成为一个突出的矛盾。
    当时，国家拖拉机站和抽水站派了几台拖拉机和抽水机来到塘南乡，帮助耕地、抽水，农民们看到“耕地不用牛”非常兴奋，感到这是节省劳动力、实现大跃进的最好的办法。于是纷纷要求高级社购买农业机械，有的生产队还写了大字报送到社里。可是一次又一次的要求都得到了同样的回答：“我们的社小，经济力量不够，现在还买不起。”
    农业生产的高速发展，迫切要求社里兴办为农业生产服务的工厂，特别是农具厂，添置必需的农具和随时修理用坏了的农具。1958年5、6月，先锋二社的菜地，突然发生了严重的虫灾，全社一百多只喷雾器由于日夜不停地使用，损坏很多，亟待修理，早修好一小时，就可以多从虫嘴里夺回一部分蔬菜。可是这个高级社只有一所设备非常简陋、由三个人组成的小厂，能起什么作用呢？社员只好把喷雾器拿到五里以外的农具修理厂去请人修理，但是这个厂当时的任务也很重。社员眼看蔬菜被害虫吃掉，非常痛心，纷纷议论。甘思福、徐金弟、张金林等在一块商议长远的办法，他们一致的结论是：“各社联合起来就好办了。”乡政府也曾考虑把各社力量组织起来，办个大的农具修理厂，并已借来两部车床，但是几经磋商，由于各社意见不一，特别是“由谁来领导”的问题得不到解决，只好作罢。
    随着蔬菜产量的增长，运输量也大大增加了。负责运输的社员，从午夜十二点开始，一直到早晨八点钟，来回四十多里，只能运一次，劳动强度高，还不能完成任务。和自然灾害作斗争，像打仗一样，有时需要集中优势的兵力，来解决某些有决定意义的战斗，否则就要遭受严重的损失。蔬菜是“娇生”作物，这种需要更为迫切。这个乡在合作化以前，在一次霜冻的袭击下，一夜之间，蔬菜被冻死了十分之七，许多农民抱头大哭，深感个体经济经不起风吹雨打的痛苦。高级社建立以后，这种情况虽有很大改变，但还没有求得根本的解决，社员们经常为此提心吊胆，他们感到没有更大范围内的协作，要战胜自然灾害，实现“亩产万斤”的指标，困难是很多的。
    为了生产的大发展，广大农民对冲破高级社的界线，联合起来办大社，是朝夕盼望着。
    瓜熟蒂落
    这时候，各高级社的干部和社员到处寻找新的出路。他们到浦东，到常熟，到湖北的孝感和麻城，为了大跃进，到处去“取经”。
    1958年7月，上海郊区各县有一批基层干部到河南遂平、新乡等地参观。先锋一社社主任陈长根，也代表塘南乡一同前往。刚到目的地，他们就听到了一个新鲜的名词：“人民公社”，并且听了和看了人民公社的许多好处。陈长根看在眼里，喜在心头，深深感到人民公社的威力。一回上海，马上到处宣传。社里传达，队里介绍，河南建立公社的消息，很快地传遍了塘南乡。社员听了，兴高采烈，感到大有奔头。从这以后，干部走到哪里，社员们就追问到哪里：“我们啥时候办人民公社？”
    这时，中共中央政治局关于在农村建立人民公社的决议公布了，塘南乡的社员们更加心花怒放，各社、各队普遍进行讨论，纷纷要求早日成立公社。社员们白天闹深翻，晚上写申请书，写大字报，申请入社。几天之内，就有近万张大字报和决心书送到了乡里。广大贫农和下中农要求入社的心情特别迫切，大部分上中农由于得到集体化的好处，也写了申请入社的大字报。有一个叫姚姐舍的老妈妈，从互助组开始，一直单干到现在，这次听说公社成立后“吃饭不要钱”，也申请加入了公社。只有个别满足于现状的人，妄想挡住这个汹涌澎湃的潮流。富裕中农陈全根就是一个代表，他在讨论办人民公社时说：“高级社满好的，为什么要办人民公社？我看还是不办的好。”但是这种意见马上被大家驳倒了。在旧社会当过多年长工的杨根兴说：“不错，初级社比互助组好，高级社比初级社好，但人民公社又比高级社好。”同时，群众一再说明，参加公社是自愿的，对不愿参加的人绝不勉强。陈全根等受到大家的启发和教育，也取消了“在半路上停下来”的打算，要求加入公社。经过畅所欲言的辩论，广大社员办人民公社的积极性更加高涨，精神更加振奋。
    9月27日，彭浦人民公社像一个成熟的婴儿一样，正式诞生了。这一天，举行了盛况空前的成立大会，有一万多人参加庆祝游行，他们敲着锣鼓，高举红旗，挥舞龙灯，抬着成绩牌，上面画着、写着自己为迎接公社而创造的成绩。一路上，社员们高呼着“中国共产党万岁”、“毛主席万岁”等口号。这种热烈的场面，绝不是任何人可以“轰”得起来的。右倾机会主义分子说什么“人民公社是共产党制造出来的”，其实，共产党不过是起了一个“助产”的作用，使这个成熟的“婴儿”顺利地诞生罢了。
    无比的生命力
    人民公社一建立，立即显示了无比的生命力，高级社时期许多无法解决的矛盾，逐步得到了解决，或者开始得到了解决。
    为了大跃进，广大社员要求置办农业机械和现代化运输工具的愿望开始实现了，劳动力不足的矛盾得到了较好的解决。由于人民公社发挥了“一大二公”的优越性，拥有较多的资金，他们正向着农业机械化的目标迈进。现在，彭浦公社已有大小拖拉机十九台，抽水机四十五台（包括人工降雨站一座），运输汽车八辆，还有现代化的电动喷雾器和电气孵卵机。当这些机器开始使用的时候，社员们非常兴奋，争着为拖拉机手送茶水，送夜餐。这些农业机械的使用，对促进生产的发展和改善人们的劳动条件，都发挥了巨大的作用。据1959年1月到8月的统计：拖拉机已耕地四千余亩，汽车每天平均运菜一千八百多担，仅这两项，就节省了九万多个人工。夏天，上海市郊遇到了几十年来少有的天旱和奇热，有十几天温度都在三十六度以上。塘南生产队有五亩卷心菜地，因地势太高，不能用机器浇水，虽然花了三十多个人工，抢浇了六次水，最后还是全部旱死了。其他菜地，由于有抽水机日夜灌溉，都获得了丰收。社员们看到在如火的烈日下蔬菜一片葱绿，都说“人民公社立了一大功”。
    为了大跃进，社员们要求举办规模较大的为农业生产服务的工厂的愿望，也实现了。公社化以后，他们贯彻了工农业并举的方针，积极发展社办工业。一年来，他们新办了大小十个工厂，把原来的四个农具修配站合并扩大，成立了拥有一百多工人的先锋农业机械厂。这个厂现在已有四台钻床、两台金属刨床、一台木工锯床、一台木工刨床、一套造型设备和一个化铁炉，工厂面貌焕然一新，铸、锻、焊、车、钳、刨、电等工种一应俱全，不仅能修理和装配抽水机、汽车等农业机械和运输工具，还能制造饲料粉碎机、手提电焊机，最近又试制成功了饲料切割机、棉花播种机和黄豆播种机。在城市工人的积极支援和帮助下，他们已经培养了一批“土专家”和技术工人。
    为了大跃进，社员们要求在更大范围内实行协作的愿望，也实现了。大协作发挥了巨大的威力，战胜了过去难以克服的困难。1959年1月初，十年来少有的寒流袭击上海市郊。经过检查，发现塘南生产队因为人手不够，稻草不足，还有一千多亩蔬菜没有复盖好，眼看就有冻死的危险。人民公社发出紧急动员令，工、农、商、学、兵全面总动员，调动了社内外三十多部汽车和拖拉机，连夜赶运稻草，各队的许多社员纷纷提前吃饭，从十里、八里以外，跑步赶来支援。塘南队的社员们在这种共产主义协作精神的鼓舞下，更是劲上加劲。不到六个小时，在寒流到来以前，他们已抢收蔬菜二万多担，用稻草复盖蔬菜一千多亩。尽管这次冷空气达到摄氏零下八度，但是这里的蔬菜却是安然无恙。社员们从这次战胜寒潮的斗争中，看到了人民公社威力的强大，他们作诗歌颂说：
    船大不怕浪来颠，
    人多不怕天气寒，
    五位一体齐跃进，
    公社力量大无边。
    由于人民公社解决了和正在解决着一系列的矛盾，显示了比高级社更大的优越性，所以农业生产获得了高速度的发展。公社的蔬菜的亩产量已突破了万斤大关，超额实现了自己的跃进指标。1958年的亩产量达到一万一千多斤，1959年1月到8月，以上市量计算，平均亩产量已达到八千六百多斤，比1958年同期增长了28.6％；而且做到了“四季常青、均衡供应”；蔬菜的品种也日渐齐全。公社新建了温室一百四十一间，即使到了寒冬腊月，室内仍然长满了红色的蕃茄、绿的黄瓜、紫的茄子、白的麻菇……。
    一年来，多种经营也有了很大的发展。公社一建立，各生产队就大造猪棚，发展养猪，目前平均每户养猪四点四头，全公社1959年上半年上市的肉猪，等于1958年全年上市量的总和。1959年饲养的鸡鸭，比1958年增加近六倍。正像社员们所形容的，现在到处是“蔬菜满园，猪羊满圈，鸡鸭成群，塘塘鱼满”。
    随着生产的发展，社员生活也有显著的提高。平均每个农民每年的收入情况如下：
    1949年　五十五元
    1957年　九十元
    1958年　一百二十九元
    1959年（预计）一百六十元就是说，1959年平均每个农民的预计收入，比1958年增长24％，比1957年增长78％，比1949年增长一点九一倍。
    公社的积累也日益增多，现在已经达到二百零五万元，其中属于公社所有制的部分有四十四万元（其余属生产队所有），这是人民更大幸福的种子。
    这个公社所属的六个生产队，已经有两个队实行了伙食供给制，四个队实行了粮食供给制。1959年秋季兴建约一万平方米的农民新村，其中包括公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、百货商店、保健站和广播室。社员陆春林搬进新村居住的时候，越想越兴奋。他说：“我住了四十三年草屋，头上没有一片瓦，想不到公社成立才一年，就搬进了这样崭新的瓦房。”他看到孩子们高兴地在地板上打滚，对前往参观的人不知说什么是好，千言万语并做一句话：“人民公社就是好。”
    人民公社的优越性才初露锋芒，这里就起了这样巨大的变化。如果说人民公社是“早产儿”，那么，请问：一个“先天不足”的组织，怎么能够发挥这样大的力量呢？
