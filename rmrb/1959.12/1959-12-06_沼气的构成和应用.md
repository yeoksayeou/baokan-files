    The Composition and Application of Biogas
    Zhaoyan

    Biogas, a type of bioenergy, gets its name because it is mainly produced in ponds and marshes. It encompasses "all gases produced in ponds and marshes." Besides containing a large amount of methane (generally 60%-70%), biogas also contains 30%-35% of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and some higher hydrocarbons.

    The methane molecule is composed of carbon and hydrogen, both elements that can burn and generate heat. Under standard conditions, general biogas contains 60%-70% methane, meaning one cubic meter of biogas can release approximately 5,500 to 6,500 kilocalories.

    By sealing organic waste such as human and animal excrement, garbage, wheat straw, rice straw, weeds, fallen branches and leaves, etc., under conditions of 20-40 degrees Celsius and a moisture content of 80%-90%, and allowing anaerobic bacteria to ferment and decompose for a certain period, a large amount of combustible gas – biogas – can be produced.

    Biogas resources are very abundant, and China's coastal areas are the best places for the accumulation of organic matter. A large amount of aquatic plants, various planktonic animals and plants floating in the sea, and other organic matter are deposited layer upon layer with the ebb and flow of the tide. Under anaerobic conditions, they are decomposed by anaerobic bacteria to form layers of decayed organic silt of varying thicknesses, gradually producing a combustible gas, sealed below the groundwater level and impermeable soil layers such as fertile clay, which is natural underground gas.

    Whether in cities or villages, mountainous areas or plains, sewage ditches and ponds all produce a large amount of biogas. Around these ditches and ponds, weeds grow densely, and there are the remains of fish, shrimp, turtles, crabs, etc., and plant debris in the ponds, as well as domestic sewage and garbage poured in, which accumulate at the bottom of the ponds. Under appropriate temperatures, biogas is produced after fermentation by methanogenic bacteria. According to tests, one cubic meter of biogas can be extracted per hour in a three-square-meter ditch. Furthermore, according to a survey in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, the county has a total of 29,000 ponds, with a total area of 23.7 million square meters. Calculating at a rate of 0.02 cubic meters of biogas produced per square meter per day, the county can produce 470,000 cubic meters of biogas per day. Among them, old ponds are the best, as they have more sludge at the bottom, which not only produces more gas but is also more stable.

    In addition to utilizing natural underground gas and biogas from ditches and ponds, man-made biogas digesters have been promoted and utilized in many regions of China. Take Fuyang County in Anhui Province as an example, where 48,000 man-made biogas digesters have been built, producing a large amount of biogas for people to use.

    Besides ensuring that the digester does not leak water and the lid does not leak gas, the mixing of materials is a key issue for man-made biogas digesters. Therefore, the requirements for the mixing of materials are fast fermentation, high gas production, and high fertilizer efficiency.

    Any substance containing fiber, protein, fat, or carbohydrates can produce biogas after fermentation. Materials such as rice straw, wheat straw, weeds, green tree leaves, manure, garbage, and sewage are all good raw materials for biogas production. The amount of gas produced varies depending on temperature conditions and content ratios. According to data and our practice, one ton of sludge can produce 640 cubic meters of biogas, one ton of green grass can produce 630 cubic meters of biogas, one ton of pig manure can produce 610 cubic meters of biogas, and one ton of human manure can produce 561 cubic meters of biogas. If using wastewater from wineries and paper mills, each ton can produce 300-600 cubic meters of biogas. Among them, green grass, rice straw, sludge, and pig manure have the highest gas production.

    When mixing materials, attention should be paid to the combination of carbon and nitrogen, generally requiring a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 25:1. To achieve rapid gas production, the following methods can be adopted:

    1. When mixing materials, especially for the first time, 5%-10% of sewage should be added to inoculate methanogenic bacteria and promote gas production; 2. Fibrous materials, such as wheat straw, rice straw, and dry grass, should be composted at high temperatures before being placed in the fermentation tank; 3. Materials and water should be added to the tank separately to avoid affecting the temperature of the tank liquid. Experience shows that cattle and horse manure have higher temperatures and ferment faster.

    The combination of biogas utilization and fertilizer accumulation not only provides a new energy source for rural areas but also provides a new source of fertilizer for agricultural production increase. The sources of fertilizer are mainly two aspects: one is farm manure, and the other is chemical fertilizer. Farm manure is essentially the reduction of plants. After humans and animals consume grains, they turn into manure and return to the land. Human and animal excrement or green grass, after biogas extraction, not only does not reduce fertilizer efficiency but also greatly increases fertilizer efficiency. According to Soviet data, the application of fermented fertilizer increases yields by an average of 25%-30%. Experiments in Wangji People's Commune, Suining, Jiangsu Province, have also yielded similar results. They used biogas fertilizer for topdressing, which increased corn test field yields by 36.6%. Zhoumiao Brigade of Chengguan Commune in Fuyang, Anhui, applied biogas fertilizer to wheat this year, which increased the yield by 200 jin per mu compared to last year, and rice yields increased by 25%.

    Biogas can be used as fuel for cooking, lighting, and illumination. Taking Fuyang as an example (according to statistics at the end of September 1959), the county has a population of 1.2 million, 120,000 head of livestock, 300,000 pigs, and 2.59 million mu of land. If one-third of the manure obtained in a year is used as fermentation raw material, and biogas production is calculated at 200 cubic meters per ton, 140 million cubic meters of biogas can be produced, which can solve the needs for lighting and cooking throughout the year. For example, a cafeteria for 100 people would require approximately 110,000 jin of dry grass per year if it were all used for boiling water and cooking. If this dry grass is fermented by biogas, 11 million jin of water fertilizer and 16,000 cubic meters of biogas can be obtained, which can completely solve the fuel problem for the 100 people's meals throughout the year.

    The significance of using biogas as power lies not only in replacing expensive liquid fuels or coal with cheap gaseous fuel, but more importantly, in opening up a new energy source for the power and fuel urgently needed in rural areas. Currently, the fixed power in rural areas is mainly diesel engines, boiler tractors, and gas engines. A 3.5-horsepower gas engine weighs 90 kilograms, and a set of gas generators and filtration equipment also weighs 90 kilograms. After switching to biogas, the 90 kilograms of complete gas generation equipment is no longer needed. The same weight of steel can be used to manufacture two machines. Looking at the cost and supply of petroleum, one kilogram of gasoline costs 80 to 90 fen, while one cubic meter of biogas has an energy equivalent to 0.7 kilograms of gasoline and costs less than 10 fen. This energy source is available everywhere in rural areas and does not need to be transported from other places. Using biogas to replace fuel oil ensures the fuel supply for rural power machinery and greatly reduces agricultural production costs. In fact, gasoline engines, gas engines, and diesel engines can all be converted to use biogas. One cubic meter of biogas can generate 1.25 kilowatts of electricity, supplying 50 points for 25 fluorescent lamps for one hour.

    Biogas is not only a cheap fuel and power source for people's lives, but also can be used to manufacture a variety of chemical products. Utilizing biogas, through physical and chemical reactions, no less than hundreds or even thousands of chemical products can be manufactured; such as methanol, formaldehyde, ether, acetylene, hydrochloric acid, chloroform, carbon black, synthetic gasoline, plastics, rubber, artificial fibers, dyes, etc.

    Currently, biogas has an excessive volume, which is inconvenient for transportation and storage. The best way is to liquefy the biogas. After liquefaction, its volume can be greatly reduced, making transportation or storage very convenient. Using liquefied biogas to power cars and internal combustion locomotives eliminates odors, makes the machine's exterior cleaner, and makes operation easier. One cubic meter of liquid methane emits 5.48 million kilocalories of heat energy, equivalent to 522 kilograms of gasoline. If biogas is widely utilized in urban and rural areas, it will play a huge role in the mechanization and electrification of agriculture.

    沼气的构成和应用
    昭彦
    生物能源——沼气因主要产自池沼而得名。它概括了“池沼中所产生的全部气体。沼气除含有大量的甲烷（一般为60％—70％）外，尚含有30％—35％的二氧化碳，氢气，还有一些更高级的碳氢化合物。
    甲烷的分子由碳和氢组成，这两种元素都是可以燃烧生热的。在标准情况下，一般沼气含甲烷量为60％—70％，即一立方米的沼气，约可放热五千五百至六千五百千卡。
    将人畜粪便、垃圾、麦秆、稻草、杂草、枯枝落叶等有机废物，在摄氏20—40度、含水量80％—90％的条件下密闭起来，经过一定时间，让嫌气性细菌进行发酵分解，就能产生多量可燃气体——沼气。
    沼气资源非常丰富，我国沿海地区是聚集有机物的最好地区。大量的水草，各种浮游在海中的动植物体及其他有机物，随着海潮进退层层沉积，在缺氧的情况下被嫌气细菌分解，形成层层厚薄不等的腐朽有机淤泥，逐渐产生一种可燃气体，封闭在地下水位和肥粘土等不透气的土层下面，这就是天然地下气。
    无论是在城市和乡村、山区和平原，污水沟塘都有大量的沼气产生。在这些沟塘周围，杂草丛生，池内有鱼、虾、龟、蟹等遗体和植物的残体，还有家庭的污水、垃圾倾入，沉积池底，在适当的温度下，经过甲烷菌的作用发酵后就产生沼气。据测验在三平方米的沟塘内，一小时可取出沼气一立方米。另根据安徽省阜阳县的调查，全县共有池塘二万九千处，总面积有二千三百七十万平方米，按每平方米日产沼气零点零二立方米计算，全县日产沼气可达四十七万立方米。其中以多年老沟塘为好，塘底污泥多，不但产气多，而且比较稳定。
    除利用天然地下气、沟塘沼气之外，人造沼气池在我国很多地区已推广利用，就拿安徽省阜阳县一县为例，就建造了四万八千个人造沼气池，产生了大量沼气，供人利用。
    人造沼气池除了要保证池子不漏水，盖子不跑气外，配料是一个关键性的问题，因此对配料的要求是发酵快，产气多，肥效高。
    凡含有纤维、蛋白质、脂肪、糖类的物质，经过发酵都能产生沼气。如稻草、麦秆、杂草、青棵树叶、粪便、垃圾、污水等都是生产沼气的很好原料。由于温度条件和含量比例不同，产气量也不同。根据资料及我们的实践证明，一吨污泥产沼气六百四十立方米，一吨青草可产沼气六百三十立方米，每吨猪粪可产沼气六百一十立方米，每吨人粪产沼气五百六十一立方米，如果利用酒厂、纸厂废水，每吨可产三百—六百立方米沼气。其中以青草、稻草、污泥、猪粪等产气量最高。
    在配料的时候，应注意碳素和氮素的配合，一般要求碳二十五比氮一。要达到产气快，可采取以下几种办法：
    一、在配料时，特别是第一次配料时，应加配5％—10％的污水，以便甲烷菌接种，促进产气；二、纤维性强的物质，如麦秸、稻草、干草等，要经高温堆肥处理后放入发酵池内；三、料、水要分别兑入池内，以免影响池液温度。经验表明，采用牛、马粪温度较高，发酵较快。
    沼气利用与积肥相结合，不但给农村提供一个新的能源，而且给农业增产上提供一个新的肥源。肥料的来源主要是两个方面：一个是农家肥料，一个是化学肥料。农家肥料实质上就是植物的还原，人畜食用谷物以后，变为粪便，还给土地。人畜粪便或青草等，在提取沼气以后，不但不减少肥效，而且大大增加了肥效。据苏联资料介绍，施用发酵后的肥料平均提高产量25％—30％。我国江苏省睢宁王集人民公社的试验，也得到同样的结果，他们用沼气肥料追肥，使玉米试验田增产36.6％。安徽阜阳城关公社周庙大队，今年施用沼气肥料的小麦，每亩较去年增产二百斤，水稻增产25％。
    沼气可以当作燃料，用来烧火做饭，点灯照明。以阜阳为例（据1959年9月底统计），全县一百二十万人口，牲口十二万头，猪三十万头，土地二百五十九万亩，一年所获粪便，如果用三分之一做发酵原料，按每吨出沼气二百立方米，可生产沼气一亿四千万立方米，即可解决全年点灯、做饭需要。又如一个一百人的食堂如全用干草烧水、煮饭，全年约需十一万斤干草，如果将这些干草经沼气发酵就可以获得一千一百万斤水肥，一万六千立方米沼气，可以完全解决这一百人全年吃饭的燃料问题。
    沼气用作动力的意义，不仅是以廉价的气体燃料代替价格较贵的液体燃料或煤炭，更重要的是给目前农村迫切所需要的动力、燃料开辟一个新的能源。目前农村中的固定动力，主要是柴油机、锅驼机、煤气机。一台三匹半马力的煤气机，身重九十公斤，一套煤气发生炉和过滤设备也是九十公斤，改用沼气以后，就不用九十公斤的全套煤气发生设备，用同样重量的钢铁可以制造两台机器。再从石油成本和供应情况看，一公斤汽油要八角到九角钱，一立方米沼气的能量合零点七公斤汽油，还不到一角钱。而这种能源农村到处都有，不要从外地运来。利用沼气代替油料，保证了农村动力机械的油料供应，而且大大降低了农业生产成本。事实上汽油机，煤气机，柴油机，都可改用沼气。一立方米沼气可发电一点二五瓩，供二十五支光电灯五十个点一个小时。
    沼气不仅是人们生活中的廉价燃料和动力能源，而且可以制造多种化工产品。利用沼气，通过物理化学作用，可制造化工产品不下百种甚至千种；如甲醇、甲醛、乙醚、乙炔、盐酸、氯仿、碳黑、合成汽油、塑料、橡胶、人造纤维、染料等皆是。
    目前沼气体积过大，既不便运输又不便储存，最好的办法是使沼气液化。液化后，它的体积可以大大缩小，运输或储藏都很便利。用液化沼气发动汽车、内燃机车，没有臭味，机器的外表将更清洁，操作也更容易。一立方米的液体甲烷，发出热能五百四十八万千卡，相当于五百二十二公斤汽油。如果广大城乡普遍利用沼气，将在农业机械化、电气化事业中起巨大的作用。
