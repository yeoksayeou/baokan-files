    Long-Distance Television Camera Cable
    Transmits the Grand National Day Parade

    China's first 40-core long-distance television camera cable has been successfully trial-produced by the Tianjin Cable Factory.

    This type of cable requires high technology and has a complex structure. During the trial production, there were neither actual samples for reference nor technical data. The workers of the Tianjin Cable Factory fully exerted their spirit of daring to think and daring to act, overcoming all difficulties in materials, equipment, and technology, and finally produced it in the third quarter.

    The grand occasion in Tiananmen Square during this year's National Day was transmitted to the Broadcasting Building through this cable, and then broadcast to meet television viewers in the capital.

    长距离电视摄像机电缆
    传送了国庆节游行盛况
    我国第一根四十芯长距离电视摄像机用电缆，已由天津电缆厂试制成功。
    这种电缆技术要求高，结构复杂，在试制的时候既没有实样参考，又没有技术资料。天津电缆厂职工充分发挥了敢想敢干的精神，冲破了材料、设备和技术上的一切困难，终于在第三季度制成了。
    今年国庆节天安门前的盛况，就是通过这根电缆传输到广播大厦，再向外发射，和首都电视观众见面的。
