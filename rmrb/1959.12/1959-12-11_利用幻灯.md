    Utilizing Slides
    I watched two movies in the countryside. Each time, before the feature film, some slides were shown. Accompanied by the narrator's simple explanations, the latest and most beautiful texts appeared one after another on the screen: "Yield List: ×× Village's wheat yield per mu reached ×× jin, an increase of ×× times compared to last year; ×× Village..." "Hero List: ×××, manure collection model in ×× Village; ×××, green manure composting model in ×× Village...". Although they were just a few simple sentences, they were warmly welcomed by the audience. Many people excitedly pointed and said while watching, "This is from our village!" Some were simply overjoyed and gesticulating. An old man sitting next to me told me, "How can we not be happy? We're on the movies! That's our village's yield list! The farthest is less than five li away from us!" As members of the People's Commune, who wouldn't feel proud that the bumper harvest and model deeds of their commune and village are shown on the screen?
    Slides can reflect the leap forward achievements of the time and place more promptly than newsreels, and promote the Party's guidelines, policies, and current events. It is recommended that rural film projection teams and commune propaganda cadres make full use of slides for propaganda to raise people's political awareness and inspire greater production enthusiasm.

    利用幻灯
    我在乡下看了两次电影。每次在正片放映以前放映了一些幻灯片。随着讲解员朴实的讲解，银幕上出现了一片接一片的最新最美的文字：“丰产榜：××村小麦亩产××斤，比去年提高××倍；××村……”“英雄榜：××村拾粪模范×××，××村沤绿肥模范×××……”。虽然它是这么简简单单的几句话，却受到观众的热烈欢迎。许多人一边看一边兴奋地指着说：“这是我们庄的！”有的简直高兴得手舞足蹈起来。坐在我身旁的一位老大爷就告诉我：“你说怎么不高兴，都上了电影啦！那是我们庄的丰产榜嘛！最远，离我们还不到五里地呢！”作为一个人民公社的社员，哪个能不为自己公社、自己村里的丰收、模范事迹搬上银幕而感到自豪呢？
    幻灯片能比新闻纪录电影更及时地反映当时当地的跃进成绩，宣传党的方针、政策和时事。建议农村电影放映队和公社宣传干部尽量利用幻灯来作宣传，以提高人们的政治认识，鼓舞更大的生产干劲。
