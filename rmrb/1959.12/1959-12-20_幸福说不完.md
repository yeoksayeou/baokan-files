Happiness is Endless
Sài Shénkè People's Commune Female Captain, Tián Xiù Mā

The happiness that the People's Commune has brought to us herding women is truly endless. Take eating as an example: before, every day after returning from grazing, there wasn't even a hot dish or a warm meal at home. No matter how tired we were, we had to start the fire and cook ourselves. During lambing season, to take care of the lambs, we often couldn't even eat a meal, sometimes not even a sip of water all day, and sometimes we couldn't even manage to cook the next meal after finishing one. Back then, women were constantly worried about food. After communization, the commune established public canteens. Whenever we returned from work, we could eat hot dishes and warm meals, eat our fill, and eat well, without having to worry about food.

The nurseries and health stations established by the commune are even more beneficial to us women. In the past, when going to the fields for labor or grazing, we had to carry our babies on our backs. During labor, we would leave the babies on the grassland, where they would get cold, go hungry, and often get sick. When a baby got sick, it would affect work. Now, when we go to work, we first put the baby in the nursery, where there are special people to take care of them, so we don't have to worry about anything. This way, we can put all our energy into production, and we can do the work that men can do. In the past, women suffered the most when giving birth. Not only was there no doctor to take care of them, but the accountant's office simply didn't allow births to happen there. Births took place on ash heaps or manure piles. After the baby was born, it was wrapped in broken felt pieces. The lives of both adults and children were not safe, and many died. Now, when women give birth, there are doctors to attend to them, so there is no need to worry about anything. After the baby is born, the commune also gives several dozens of days of maternity leave, and wages are paid as usual. Even after menstruation, care is taken not to do heavy work.

The commune implements a system that combines supply and wages, and we women are now equal to men economically. In the past, when we saw our favorite printed cloth, shoes, socks, etc., we could only look at them a few times because we didn't have control over the money and couldn't buy them. Now that we participate in labor and get paid ourselves, it's convenient to buy whatever we want. The People's Commune is truly wonderful! The happiness it brings to us women is endless. We must work hard, do a good job in production, and strive for a double harvest in animal husbandry and agricultural production to repay the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    幸福说不完
    赛什克公社女队长　田秀玛
    人民公社给我们牧民妇女带来的幸福真是说不完。拿吃饭来说吧，以前每天放牧回来，家里连一口热菜热饭也没有，身体再疲倦，也得自己动手生火做饭。在产羔期间，为了照顾羊羔，经常吃不上饭，有时一天连一口水都喝不上，有时吃了上顿做不了下顿。那时候，妇女经常为吃饭发愁。公社化后，社里成立了公共食堂，什么时候劳动回来，都能吃上热菜热饭，吃得饱、吃得好，用不着为吃饭发愁了。
    公社成立的托儿所、保健站，对我们妇女的好处就更大了。过去下地劳动放牧，都要把娃娃背上，劳动时就把娃娃放在草滩上，娃娃挨冻受饿，经常害病。娃娃生了病，就要影响干活。现在去劳动，先把娃娃往托儿所一放，有专人照管，啥心也不用操。这样，我们就能把全力投在生产上，男人能干的活，我们也能干。过去，妇女生娃娃是最受罪的事，不但没有医生照管，帐房里根本不让生，就在灰堆、粪堆上生，娃娃生下后用破毡片包，大人、小孩的生命都不保险，死亡的很多。现在，妇女生娃娃，有医生守在跟前，什么愁也不用犯了。娃娃生过后，公社里还给放几十天产假，工资照常发，就连月经来后，也照顾不做重活。
    公社实行供给制和工资制相结合的制度，我们妇女在经济上和男子平等了。以前我们看见心爱的花布、鞋、袜等，只能看上几遍，自己手里不掌握钱，不能买。现在自己参加劳动，工资发给自己，要买什么都方便。人民公社真是太好了，它带给我们妇女的幸福说也说不完。我们一定好好劳动，搞好生产，争取畜牧业生产和农业生产双丰收，报答党和毛主席的恩情。
