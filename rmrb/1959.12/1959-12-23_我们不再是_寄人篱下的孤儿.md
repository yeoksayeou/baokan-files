　　We Are No Longer "Orphans Under Someone Else's Roof"
　　Lian An
    For countless years, the millions of overseas Chinese drifting abroad have been regarded as "orphans under someone else's roof."

    However, this tragic era ended the day the People's Republic of China emerged from the Asian horizon like a brilliant sun. Overseas Chinese, that segment of the Chinese people who, due to historical and social reasons, have resided abroad for generations, now have a prosperous and strong socialist motherland as their backing, and they are deeply proud to be citizens of the new China.

    If anyone today still views our millions of compatriots residing overseas with the old perspective, thinking they can still be humiliated and manipulated like in the old China era, then they are gravely mistaken.

    Indeed, there was such an era when tens of millions of overseas Chinese drifted abroad. Under the knives of the colonialists, in those barren islands and wildernesses, they engaged in slave-like labor alongside the local residents. Some were deceived and sold as "pigs," their lives ended under iron hooves and whips. Others, due to the presence of wolves in their homeland, left their homes and families under the coercion of natural and man-made disasters, embarking on voyages across the ocean.

    Their blood and sweat were sprinkled on these scattered island groups. Together with the local working people, they transformed these islands into prosperous markets. They created so much social wealth, but it was all robbed by the colonialist bandits.

    In those tragic years, the homeland, like Southeast Asia, was under the iron heel of imperialism. Compradors, bureaucrats, warlords, landlords... colluded with imperialism, engaging in rampant rape, plunder, and abduction. The overseas Chinese "seemed to have homes, but could not return; cuckoos should not cry in their ears." With eyes full of tears, to whom could they pour out their sorrows?

    For many years, this group of helpless "orphans" yearned for a strong and prosperous motherland! From the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition, the War of Resistance Against Japan, to the War of Liberation, after a long and arduous period, finally, the beautiful day arrived. On the Asian horizon, a dazzling sun appeared. Motherland, you have finally turned yourself over from under the iron hooves of the three great enemies. From now on, the era of being enslaved is gone forever. Your twelve million children drifting overseas now have a reliance and will never again be "orphans under someone else's roof." With the support of our 650 million brothers and sisters and the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who would dare to humiliate and oppress us as they did in the past?

    We are not only proud because we have a strong socialist motherland, but also because our great motherland selflessly supports the independence struggles of oppressed nations overseas. Our traditional friendship with the people of the countries where we reside has been further developed. This is our second homeland. Not only are there sweat droplets left by our arduous labor, opening up the land together with the local residents, but also blood droplets left by our resistance against the colonialists together with the local residents. This deep friendship accumulated over generations can never be erased. The friendship established between the Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries in the struggle against colonialism is unbreakable. Clouds cannot obscure the sun. Imperialist conspiracies to stage a comeback, provoking friendship between the new China and Asian and African independent countries, will eventually be seen through and defeated by the people of Asia and Africa.

    Motherland, with you, we can return to your warm embrace at any time and participate in the radiant socialist construction. Motherland, just thinking of you, we feel an immense power all over our bodies.

　　我们不再是“寄人篱下的孤儿”
　　廉岸
    不知多少年来，漂流在海外的千百万华侨，一直被看做“寄人篱下的孤儿”。
    然而，这种悲惨的时代，随着中华人民共和国像光辉的太阳那样从亚洲地平线上出现的那一天起，就一去不复返了。华侨，这一部分由于历史、社会的原因，世世代代居留在海外的中国人，已经有了一个繁荣富强的社会主义祖国作为靠山，他们深深以作为新中国的公民而自豪。
    如果，今天还有人用老眼光来看待我们居留在海外的千百万侨胞，以为他们还是像旧中国时代那样可以任人凌辱、任人摆布，那就大错而特错了。
    不错，曾经有过那样的时代，千千万万的华侨在海外漂流，他们在殖民主义者的屠刀下，在那些荒岛与莽原之中，跟当地居民在一起，从事奴隶般的劳动。他们当中，有的是被骗卖作“猪仔”，在铁蹄和皮鞭下断送了一生；有的则由于故国豺狼当道，在天灾人祸的胁迫下离乡背井，抛妻离子而远涉重洋。
    他们的血汗洒遍在这些星罗棋布的岛群上，他们和当地劳动人民一起，使这些岛屿变成繁盛的市廛。他们创造了多少社会财富，然而，都被殖民主义的强盗抢去了。
    在悲惨的年代里，故国跟南洋一样处在帝国主义的铁蹄下，买办、官僚、军阀、地主……与帝国主义狼狈为奸，到处奸淫掳掠，侨胞们“等是有家归未得，杜鹃休向耳边啼”，他们满眶热泪，又能向谁倾诉呢？
    多少年来，这群无依的“孤儿”，多么渴望着有一个强大繁荣的祖国啊！从辛亥革命、北伐战争、抗日战争、到解放战争，经过漫长的艰苦的岁月，终于，这美好的日子来到了，在亚洲地平线上，出现了灿烂夺目的太阳。祖国啊，你终于从三大敌人的铁蹄下翻了身，从此，被人奴役的时代一去不复返了，你漂流于海外的一千二百万儿女，从今有了依靠，永远不再是“寄人篱下的孤儿”了。我们有了六亿五千万兄弟姐妹的支持，有着共产党和毛主席的英明领导，谁再敢像过去那样凌辱和欺压我们呢？
    我们不但因为有了强盛的社会主义祖国而感到自豪，而且，我们伟大的祖国，还无私地支援了海外被压迫民族的独立斗争，我们和侨居国人民的传统友谊，得到了进一步的发扬。这儿是我们的第二故乡，这儿不但有我们披荆斩棘，跟当地居民一起辛勤开发所留下的汗滴，还有我们跟当地居民一起抗击殖民主义者所留下的血滴。这种世世代代积累下来底深厚的情谊，是永远不能磨灭的；中国人民跟亚非各国人民之间在反对殖民主义斗争中建立起来的友谊，是牢不可破的。乌云遮不住太阳，帝国主义阴谋卷土重来，挑拨新中国和亚非独立国家之间的友谊，总归会被亚非人民所识破和击破。
    祖国啊，有了你，我们随便什么时候，都可以回到你温暖的怀抱里来，参加光芒万丈的社会主义建设。祖国啊，只要想起了你，我们便感到浑身有无比的力量。
