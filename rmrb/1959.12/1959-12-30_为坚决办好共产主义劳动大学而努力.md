　　Strive to Resolutely Run Communist Labor Universities Well
　　Liu Junxiu, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and concurrently President of the Communist Labor University

    Our Communist Labor University was established on August 1, 1958. It was founded in the new situation and new tasks of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction; it emerged under the new situation of socialist construction entering a stage centered on technological and cultural revolutions; it arose under the call of our Party for cadres to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, participate in labor production, and train themselves to become both red and expert; and especially under the encouragement of the general line of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    Our guiding principle for running Communist Labor Universities is: education serving proletarian politics, education combined with productive labor, implementing diligence and frugality, and part-work, part-study. Its purpose is mainly to cultivate a large number of construction talents with a communist style, combining theory and practice, politics and profession, and mental and physical labor, who are both red and expert, to build prosperous and happy new socialist mountain areas.

    Implementing the Party's Education Policy, Remarkable Achievements Have Been Made in School Construction, Learning, and Production

    From the beginning of its establishment to the present, the Communist Labor University has resolutely implemented the policy of education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor. Therefore, our Communist Labor University has achieved remarkable results in school construction, learning, and production. At present, one main campus, eighty-eight branch campuses, and fourteen affiliated labor technical schools have been established throughout the province. Before August 1 this year, the entire school had more than 37,000 students. In August and September, more than 17,000 new students were enrolled, and now there are more than 55,000 students. Most of the students are cadres and young students from people's communes in various parts of the province, and a considerable number are from eighteen provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, who came to the Communist Labor University to take the entrance examination. When we started building the school in August last year, we faced a wilderness, but under the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels, all teachers and students displayed the spirit of diligence, bravery, and hard work, blazing trails and overcoming various difficulties in the uninhabited deep mountains, dense forests, and red soil wastelands, building the school, learning, and producing at the same time. They made bricks and cut wood themselves, building walls and erecting houses, making beds, desks, benches, and various production tools. In just over a year, the main campus and branch campuses have built more than 200,200 square meters of new school buildings. They initially lived in thatched sheds, and now they have gradually built teaching buildings, auditoriums, and dormitories; at the same time, they have established production bases, striving for self-sufficiency in production. According to statistics from the main campus, eighty-three branch campuses, and eleven labor technical schools, eighty-four farms have been established, with a cultivated area of nearly 30,000 mu; thirty-five forest farms, orchards, and nurseries, with a forest area of 410,000 mu; ninety-three livestock farms, raising more than 13,000 pigs, 2,500 cattle and sheep, and 45,000 chickens and ducks; and 208 small factories producing artificial fibers, artificial petroleum, tannin extract, cement, wine, aromatic oil, and so on. From August last year to October this year, in just one year and two months, the total income from various productions of the main campus and branch campuses has reached 12 million yuan. Now more than 80% of the schools have achieved production self-sufficiency or surplus. For example, the Jinggangshan, Da Maoshan, Deshengguan, Huanggangshan, and Fengshushan branch campuses have an average annual income of more than 300 yuan per person, and the Donggushan, Daling Mountains and Wuzhifeng branch campuses have an average annual income of more than 400 yuan per person. While building the school and engaging in labor production, the main campus and branch campuses have systematically carried out the study of political culture, production technology, and basic scientific knowledge in a planned manner. Under the unified teaching plan of the main campus, the branch campuses have formulated teaching plans and teaching syllabuses, compiled teaching materials, and appropriately arranged the time for teaching and productive labor according to the characteristics of their own schools. In the teaching process, some teaching methods suitable for the characteristics of Communist Labor Universities have been initially explored. Some young men and women students from the cities generally did not participate in physical labor in the past, but now they actively participate in labor production and have learned a lot of production knowledge in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and industry; some young people from the countryside who lacked culture have made great progress in political culture and scientific knowledge after more than a year of study. These achievements are mainly due to: the correct leadership of the Party, the brilliant illumination of the general line, and the result of resolutely implementing the Party's education policy; the result of the hard work of all teachers, students, and staff in building the school, studying hard, and producing hard; and the result of the active help and strong support of the local Party and government, state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms, and the broad masses of people in terms of manpower, financial resources, and materials.

    However, in the process of building the school, learning, and producing in the past year, it has not been smooth sailing, but through resolute and tenacious struggles against various difficulties and various incorrect ideas, we have gradually developed, grown, and consolidated our Communist Labor University from scratch. The Communist Labor University we have founded is fundamentally different from the bourgeois universities of the past. Bourgeois universities cultivate intellectuals to serve the bourgeoisie according to the bourgeois way of life. Their philosophy is "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," and their purpose is to disseminate bourgeois ideology and lifestyle and consolidate bourgeois rule. They regard labor and the working people as the most inferior. In the old society, the children of workers, peasants, and other working people not only were not qualified to enter universities, but also had very few opportunities to attend middle school or even primary school. Our Communist Labor University is a university of workers, peasants, and other working people under the leadership of the Communist Party, and a university for cultivating various talents for building socialism and realizing communism. We communists regard labor as the noblest, most glorious, and most heroic undertaking. Workers, peasants, and other working people are the masters of our society. Our university opens the door to admission and further study for the children of workers and peasants, and absorbs a large number of workers and peasants with a certain level of culture and production knowledge to study, cultivating them into construction talents who are both red and expert in study and productive labor. This will more powerfully promote the development of productivity and production, adapt to the needs of the continued leap forward in socialist construction, and serve the construction of socialism-communism.

    Running Universities Should Also Take Two Legs; Communist Labor Universities Open the Door to Further Study for the Children of Workers and Peasants

    Some people still measure the Communist Labor University with the bourgeois perspective of running schools, which is obviously completely wrong. China's industrial and agricultural production is developing at an unprecedentedly high speed, requiring a large number of construction talents with communist consciousness and higher cultural and scientific knowledge, and demanding the communist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge level of workers and peasants be improved at the fastest speed. Under the current conditions in our country, it is necessary to run full-time universities that enroll students with high school graduation level. But simply running full-time universities cannot meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and will exclude a large number of worker-peasant cadres and the broad masses of working people from the doors of universities. Therefore, we believe that in addition to running full-time universities, it is also necessary to run various specialized universities for part-work and part-study, and that full-time universities and various specialized universities for part-work and part-study should be run simultaneously; running universities cannot take a one-legged approach, but should take a two-legged approach. Only in this way can we meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in our country, and meet the demands of the vast number of worker-peasant cadres and the children of workers and peasants to enter universities. Our Communist Labor University was founded in this spirit. As for some people saying that the students of the Labor University have uneven cultural levels, incomplete equipment, and irregular teaching, and do not look like a university, we believe this view is also not comprehensive enough. Our standard for measuring whether a school is good or bad, high or low, cannot simply look at the students' cultural level and the school's teaching equipment, but should mainly consider whether it can cultivate socialist construction talents for the country who have a high level of socialist consciousness and a certain level of political theory and scientific knowledge. The students of our Communist Labor University, in addition to generally having poorer cultural level and book knowledge, are generally richer in knowledge of class struggle and practical production knowledge because they are from worker-peasant backgrounds or are the children of workers and peasants, and have participated in labor production for a certain period of time. These two kinds of knowledge, that is, the basic knowledge of social science and natural science, are also essential knowledge for each of us in socialist construction. As long as we particularly strengthen cultural education for some students with lower cultural levels, their cultural levels can be improved quickly. It should be affirmed that the vast majority of our students generally have high revolutionary enthusiasm and a tenacious spirit of perseverance. As long as the teaching is effective, coupled with their own subjective efforts, it is possible to reach or basically reach the university level in terms of cultural level, political theory, and scientific knowledge during the study period. As for the fact that the current equipment and teaching staff conditions of the Communist Labor University are not as good as those of ordinary universities, this is also true. However, our Communist Labor University has the correct school-running policy, rich production resources and broad production channels, the hard study and diligent production of all teachers and students, and the help and support of all parties. We are determined and confident to gradually build the Communist Labor University into a new type of institution with complete equipment and excellent teaching, and to gradually realize mechanization and electrification of all students in productive labor.

    The practice of the past year and more has proved that establishing Communist Labor Universities is completely in line with our Party's education policy. We have achieved great results and have also explored some experiences in running schools, but after all, the time has been short and there are still many problems. We must also summarize the experiences of running schools in the past year, overcome some shortcomings in teaching and productive labor, and further consolidate and expand the Communist Labor University on the existing basis. To this end, under the continued implementation of the policy of education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor, we must firmly grasp the following links and work hard in the future:

    Future Efforts

    1.  Correctly Implement the Party's Education Policy and Teaching Plan to Improve Teaching Quality, and Properly Arrange Time for Study, Labor, and Rest

    The Communist Labor University is a comprehensive university for cultivating various construction talents for socialism-communism. The basic courses of the school include three major categories: philosophy, social sciences, and natural sciences. Departments of social sciences, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, industry, and mathematics and physics have been established. With the development of the school, the main campus and branch campuses should gradually add other departments according to specific conditions and different original foundations.

    In order to appropriately arrange study, productive labor, and rest time, to do a good job in both study and production, and to enable students to study and labor rhythmically, the time ratio for study and productive labor: for four-year departments, the labor time is six, five, four, and four, that is, laboring for six months in the first academic year, laboring for five months in the second academic year, and laboring for four months in the third and fourth academic years; the study time is five, six, seven, and seven, that is, studying for five months in the first academic year, studying for six months in the second academic year, and studying for seven months in the third and fourth academic years; rest time is one month per year.

    Since agricultural production has strong seasonality, the main campus and branch campuses can adopt the methods of attending classes while laboring, attending classes on rainy days and laboring on sunny days, attending classes during slack seasons and laboring during busy seasons, and alternating between attending classes and productive labor, depending on local conditions and time.

    In order to run Communist Labor Universities well and improve teaching quality, it is currently necessary to vigorously cultivate teachers and compile teaching materials. The solution to the problem of teachers should be based on self-reliance and local training, and strive for strong support from the relevant departments of the Central Government and brother schools. Sound and strengthen the work of teaching and research groups, solve the problem by using the method of old leading new, high leading low, mutual teaching and learning, and teaching and learning while improving. In order to train teachers, the main campus has established teacher training classes in the Department of Social Sciences, the Department of Mathematics and Physics, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and industry, and has planned to hold short-term training classes for teachers in batches and phases to train teachers, improve the level of teachers, and expand the teaching staff. In order to solve the current difficulty of the shortage of teachers, the branch campuses have selected a group of comrades with expertise in specialized fields from cadres of state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms to serve as teachers, and have also hired local Party and government leading comrades and cadres and technicians with a certain level to teach certain courses. The main way to improve teaching quality must be to closely combine teaching, production, and scientific research, so that they promote each other and improve together. Lenin once said: "Neither teaching and education divorced from production, nor productive labor without simultaneous teaching and education, can reach the height required by the current state of technology and scientific knowledge." Our Communist Labor University has rich material resources and broad production bases, which is not only the main reliance for production self-sufficiency, but also the best classroom for teaching and the natural laboratory and research room for carrying out scientific research. We have extremely favorable conditions for implementing the combination of teaching, production, and scientific research. Therefore, in addition to carrying out scientific research and teaching in combination with productive labor, the branch campuses and affiliated labor technical schools should arrange production content according to the requirements of the teaching syllabus and education plan, so that the classroom teaching and on-site teaching are organically linked, so that students can master the knowledge and skills of the major they are studying from the practice of productive labor and theory, so that students can use the principles of Marxism-Leninism to solve practical problems.

    In order to make the teaching plan adapt to the current level of students, so that students can understand quickly, make a deep impression, and receive better results in learning, the teaching content and teaching methods should pay attention to the teaching methods of going from near to far, from shallow to deep, from low to high, combining theory and practice, explanation and self-study, classroom and on-site, and learning and application. For students with particularly low cultural levels, preparatory classes can be set up to conduct cultural tutoring, so that they can reach a cultural level above junior high school in about two years, and then transfer to undergraduate study. The affiliated labor technical schools all implement part-work and part-study, with a study time of two years, and the purpose is to cultivate secondary technical talents.

      2.  Effectively Do a Good Job in Production Bases, Widely Open up Production Channels, and Achieve Production Self-Sufficiency or Surplus

    In order to facilitate the combination of education and productive labor, implement the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results and diligence and frugality in running schools, and self-reliance, the branch campuses should, according to local resource conditions, adapt to local conditions, develop locally, and use local materials to run farms, factories, forest farms, horticultural farms, livestock farms, and other production undertakings with less investment, quick results, and high income. In labor production, first achieve self-sufficiency, and then achieve self-sufficiency with surplus, and lay a material foundation for long-term school running and school construction. The experience of the past year and more tells us that the branch campuses and affiliated labor technical schools that have delineated a certain amount of land, mountains and forests, pastures, fish ponds, and small factories as production bases have done a good job in production and can achieve production self-sufficiency or surplus. This not only reduces the burden on the state economically, but also greatly stimulates and encourages students' enthusiasm for production and learning. Therefore, all localities should continue to find ways to solve the problem of production materials such as land, mountains and forests, pastures, and fish ponds necessary for production for the local branch campuses and affiliated labor technical schools from state-owned land and mountains and forests and land and mountains and forests that the communes are unable to operate (including current cultivated land and reclaimed wasteland), so as to quickly establish bases for diversified operations such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and industry, and widely open up production channels, first achieving production self-sufficiency, and even self-sufficiency with surplus. This is the material foundation to ensure the successful running of Communist Labor Universities, and it is also an important aspect of realizing the combination of mental and physical labor. For the requirement of production self-sufficiency, the branch campuses and affiliated labor technical schools should first achieve the self-sufficiency of the students' food expenses and living welfare expenses, and then gradually use it for infrastructure construction and expanded reproduction as the school's production income increases. The standard of student supply should be determined according to the production situation of each school. If the production is good, it can be higher, and if the production is poor, it can be lower. Under the current conditions, the food expenses and living allowances should generally be 14 yuan to 20 yuan per person per month.

    3.  Strengthen Party Leadership and Implement Politics in Command

    Strengthening Party leadership and implementing politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for further consolidating, improving, and expanding Communist Labor Universities. Only by strengthening Party leadership can we implement politics in command, can we conduct socialist-communist education widely and deeply among teachers and students, can we effectively carry out the education of the Party's general line and the Party's policies, and can we more effectively carry out the struggle against various erroneous tendencies; only by strengthening Party leadership can we ensure the correct implementation of the Party's education policy and the teaching methods of the mass line. At the same time, all teachers, students, and cadres must further recognize that the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor" is the fundamental policy of our Party's socialist-communist education, and is an important measure to popularize and improve the cultural level of the broad masses of people, improve the socialist-communist consciousness of all cadres and the broad masses of people, and gradually reduce and even eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor; at the same time, we must further recognize that the implementation of diligence and frugality and part-work and part-study is the most effective way to implement the Party's education policy.

    In summary, as long as we resolutely implement the Party's education policy and earnestly do the above three aspects of work, we can do a good job in teaching, production, and school construction, and run the Communist Labor University better, and continue to expand on the basis of consolidation and improvement. It is required that by 1961, the students of the main campus, 88 branch campuses, and 14 affiliated labor technical schools of the Communist Labor University will be developed to 100,000. That is to say, we will lay a good foundation from 1958 to 1961. On this basis, 40,000 students will graduate and 40,000 new students will be enrolled every year. In this way, our Communist Labor University can train and graduate 400,000 students from 1958 to 1971 in 14 years. This will cultivate a large number of college students with a higher cultural level and a certain theoretical level and scientific knowledge for the vast mountainous areas of our province and the people's communes of the province, and cultivate a large number of talents for the country's socialist construction, and will make great contributions to the construction of new socialist mountainous areas with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

　　为坚决办好共产主义劳动大学而努力
　　中共江西省委书记兼共产主义劳动大学总校校长　刘俊秀
    我们的共产主义劳动大学，是在1958年8月1日成立的。它是在社会主义建设大跃进的新形势和新任务的情况下创办的；是在进入以技术革命和文化革命为中心内容的社会主义建设的新形势下产生的；是我们党向干部提出上山下乡，参加劳动生产，锻炼成又红又专的号召下产生的；特别是在党中央和毛主席提出：鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下产生的。
    我们办共产主义劳动大学的方针是：教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合，实行勤工俭学、半工半读。其目的，主要是为了培养具有共产主义风格的、理论与实践相结合、政治与业务相结合、脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的又红又专的大批建设人才，建设繁荣幸福的社会主义新山区。
    贯彻执行党的教育方针，在建校、学习和生产等方面都取得了显著成绩
    共产主义劳动大学，从建校开始到现在，坚决贯彻执行了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的办校方针。因此，我们的共产主义劳动大学，无论在建校、学习和生产等方面，都取得了显著的成绩。目前，全省已建立总校一所，分校八十八所，附属劳动技术学校十四所，在今年8月1日以前，全校共有学生三万七千多名，在8、9月间又招收了新生一万七千多名，现在共有学生五万五千多名。学生中大部分是来自本省各地人民公社的干部和青年学生，也有相当一部分是从上海、浙江、江苏、安徽、福建、湖南、湖北、河南、四川、广东、广西等十八个省市到共产主义劳动大学投考入学的。去年8月建校开始时，我们面对着一片荒山野岭，但是在各级党委的坚强领导下，全体师生发挥了勤劳勇敢和艰苦奋斗的精神，在荒无人烟的深山密林中和红土荒山上，披荆斩棘，战胜各种困难，一面建校，一面学习，一面生产。他们自己动手烧砖砍木，砌墙架屋，制造床铺、桌椅板凳和各种生产工具，仅仅经过一年多的时间，总校和各分校，已建成新校舍二十万零二千多平方米。他们最初住着茅棚，现在已逐步盖起了教学大楼、礼堂和寝室；同时，建立了生产基地，力争生产自给。据总校和八十三个分校、十一个劳动技术学校的统计，已经举办了农场八十四个，耕地面积近三万亩；林场、果木园、苗圃三十五个，林地面积四十一万亩；畜牧场九十三个，养猪一万三千多头，牛羊二千五百头，鸡鸭四万五千多只；并举办了人造纤维、人造石油、栲胶、水泥、酿酒、芳香油等各种小型工厂二百零八个。从去年8月到今年10月，仅一年零二个月的时间，总校和各分校各项生产的总收益已达到一千二百万元。现在已经有80％以上的学校作到了生产自给或自给有余。例如井冈山、大茅山、德胜关、黄岗山、枫树山等分校，每人每年平均收益达三百元以上，东固山、大岭山、五指峰等分校，每人每年平均收益已达到四百元以上。在建校与劳动生产的同时，总校和各分校都有计划地、较有系统地进行了政治文化、生产技术和基本科学知识等课程的学习。各分校在总校的统一教学计划下，根据本校的特点，制定了教学计划和教学大纲，编写了教材，适当地安排了教学和生产劳动的时间。在教学过程中，初步地摸索了一些适合于共产主义劳动大学特点的教学方法。有些来自城市的青年男女学生，过去一般不参加体力劳动，现在他们积极参加劳动生产，并在农业、林业、牧业、副业、渔业、工业等方面，学到了许多生产知识；有些来自农村缺乏文化的青年，经过一年多来的学习，在政治文化和科学知识方面，都有了很大的提高。这些成绩的取得，主要是：在党的正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，由于坚决贯彻了党的教育方针的结果；由于全体师生和职工努力建校，努力学习，努力生产的结果；由于当地党政和各国营综合垦殖场与广大群众，在人力、财力、物力上积极帮助与大力支持的结果。
    但是，我们在一年来的建校、学习、生产的过程中，并不是一帆风顺的，而是在同各种困难、以及各式各样不正确的思想进行了坚决的顽强的斗争，才将我们共产主义劳动大学从无到有，由小到大，逐步地发展壮大和巩固起来的。我们所创办的共产主义劳动大学，是同过去资产阶级的大学有根本区别的。资产阶级大学，是按照资产阶级的生活方式，培养为资产阶级服务的知识分子，他们的哲学是“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，他们的目的，是为了传播资产阶级的思想意识和生活方式，巩固资产阶级的统治。他们把劳动和劳动人民看做是最下贱的。在旧社会里，工人、农民和其他劳动人民的子弟，不但没有资格入大学，就是进中学以至进小学念书的机会也很少。我们共产主义劳动大学，是在共产党领导下的工人、农民和其他劳动人民的大学，是为建设社会主义、实现共产主义培养各种人才的大学。我们共产党人把劳动看做是最高尚、最光荣、最豪迈的事业。工人、农民和其他劳动人民是我们社会的主人。我们这个大学，给工农子弟敞开了入学深造的大门，大量吸收具有一定文化水平和一定生产知识的工农劳动群众入学，在学习与生产劳动中，培养他们成为又红又专的建设人才，这就将更有力地促进生产力和生产的发展，适应社会主义建设继续跃进的需要，为建设社会主义—共产主义服务。
    办大学也应当两条腿走路；共产主义劳动大学给工农子弟敞开深造的大门
    现在还有些人，以资产阶级的办学观点来衡量共产主义劳动大学，这种观点显然是完全错误的。我国工农业生产正以空前的高速度向前发展，需要大量的具有共产主义觉悟和文化科学知识较高的又红又专的建设人才，要求用最快的速度提高工农群众的共产主义觉悟和文化科学知识水平。在我国目前条件下，招收具有高中毕业程度的学生举办全日制大学，这是必要的。但仅仅办全日制大学，就不可能满足社会主义建设大跃进的需要，也就是将大批工农干部和广大劳动群众排挤在大学门外。因此，我们认为：除了举办全日制大学以外，还必须举办半工半读的各种专业大学，应当以全日制大学和半工半读的各种专业大学同时并举；办大学也不能采取一条腿走路，而应当是两条腿走路。只有这样，才能适应我国社会主义建设大跃进的需要，才能满足广大工农干部和工农子弟入大学的要求。我们共产主义劳动大学就是本着这个精神创办的。至于有人说：劳动大学学生的文化程度参差不齐，设备不完善，教学不正规，不像个大学。这种看法，我们认为也是不够全面的。我们衡量一个学校好坏高低的标准，不能单纯地看学生文化程度和学校的教学设备，应当从它是否能够为国家培养出有较高的社会主义觉悟，又有一定政治理论水平和科学知识的社会主义建设人才为主要标志。我们共产主义劳动大学的学生，除了文化程度和书本知识一般较差外，由于他们是工农出身或者是工农子弟，参加过一定时期的劳动生产，他们的阶级斗争知识和实际生产知识，一般都比普通学生丰富。这两种知识，也就是社会科学和自然科学的基本知识，也正是我们每个人，在社会主义建设中，必不可少的知识。只要我们对一些文化程度较低的学生特别加强文化教育，他们的文化程度是能够很快提高的。应当肯定地说，我们全校绝大多数学生，一般都具有较高的革命热情和顽强的钻研精神，只要教学得法，加上自己的主观努力，就有可能在学习期间内，在文化程度、政治理论、科学知识等方面达到或者基本上达到大学水平。至于说，共产主义劳动大学目前的设备、师资条件不如一般大学，这也是事实。但是，我们共产主义劳动大学，有正确的办学方针，有较丰富的生产资源和广阔的生产门路，有全体师生的努力学习、勤劳生产，以及各方面的帮助和支援，我们一定有决心有信心，将共产主义劳动大学，逐步地建设成为设备完善、教学优良的新型学府，并且使全体学生在生产劳动中，逐步地实现机械化和电气化。
    一年多来的实践证明，创办共产主义劳动大学，是完全符合我们党的教育方针的。我们已经取得了很大的成绩，也摸索到了一些办学经验，但毕竟时间很短，存在的问题还是不少，我们还必须很好地总结一年多来的办学经验，克服在教学与生产劳动中存在的某些缺点，使共产主义劳动大学在现有的基础上，进一步巩固与扩大。为此，在继续贯彻教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的办学方针下，今后必须抓紧以下各个环节，努力作好工作：
    今后的努力方向
    一、必须正确地贯彻执行党的教育方针、教学计划提高教学质量，妥善安排学习、劳动和休息时间
    共产主义劳动大学，是培养社会主义—共产主义各项建设人才的综合性大学。学校的基本课程包括哲学、社会科学、自然科学三大类。现已设立了社会科学、农业、林业、牧业、工业和数理化等系科。随着学校的发展，总校和各分校应当根据具体条件和原有的不同基础，逐步地增设其他系科。
    为了适当地安排学习、生产劳动与休息时间，做到既搞好学习又搞好生产，使学生有节奏地进行学习和劳动，学习和生产劳动的时间比例：四年制系科劳动时间为六、五、四、四，即第一学年劳动六个月，第二学年劳动五个月，第三、第四学年各劳动四个月；学习时间为五、六、七、七，即第一学年学习五个月，第二学年学习六个月，第三、第四学年各学习七个月；休息时间每年一个月。
    由于农业生产有强烈的季节性，总校和各分校对学习和生产劳动时间的具体安排，可以因地制宜、因时制宜地采取边上课边劳动，雨天上课、晴天劳动，农闲时上课、农忙时劳动，上课与生产劳动轮换进行。
    为了办好共产主义劳动大学，提高教学质量，目前必须大力培养师资，编写教材。解决师资的办法，应当以自力更生、就地培养为主，并力求中央各有关部门和兄弟学校大力支援。健全和加强教研组的工作，以老带新，以高带低，互教互学，边教边学边提高的办法加以解决。为了培养师资，在总校设立了社会科学系、数理化学系和农业、林业、牧业、工业等师资班，并有计划地分期分批地举办师资短期轮训班，培养师资，提高师资水平和扩大师资队伍。为了解决当前师资缺少的困难，各分校已从国营综合垦殖场干部中，选拔了一批对专业有特长的同志担任教师，也聘请了当地党政领导同志和具有一定水平的干部、技术人员担任一定的课程。提高教学质量的主要途径，必须认真地把教学、生产和科学研究三方面紧密地结合起来，使之互相促进，共同提高。列宁曾经说过：“无论是脱离生产的教学和教育，或是没有同时进行教学和教育的生产劳动，都不能达到现代技术和科学知识现状所要求的高度。”我们共产主义劳动大学有丰富的物质资源和广阔的生产基地，这不仅是生产自给的主要依靠，同时也是教学最好的大课堂和开展科学研究的天然实验室和研究室，我们贯彻教学、生产和科学研究三结合，具有极为有利的条件。因此，各分校和附属劳动技术学校，除在生产劳动中结合进行科学研究和教学外，都应当按照教学大纲和教育计划的要求来安排生产内容，使之把课堂教学与现场教学有机地联系起来，使学生从生产劳动实践中和理论上掌握所学专业的知识与技能，以便使学生能够运用马克思列宁主义的原则，去解决实际问题。
    为了使教学计划与当前的学生水平相适应，以便利学生在学习中领会快，印象深，收到更好的效果，在教育内容与教学方法上应当注意采用由近到远，由浅入深，由低到高，理论与实际、讲解与自学、教室与现场、学与用相结合的教学方法。对文化水平特别低的学生，可以设立预科班，进行文化补习，使之在两年左右达到初中以上文化程度，然后转入本科学习。对于附属劳动技术学校，都实行半工半读，学习时间两年，其目的在于培养中等技术人才。
      二、切实搞好生产基地，广泛开辟生产门路，实现生产自给或自给有余
    为了便于教育与生产劳动相结合，贯彻多快好省和勤俭办学、自力更生的原则，各分校应该根据当地资源条件，因地制宜，就地开发，就地取材，举办农场、工厂、林场、园艺场、畜牧场及其他投资少、收效快、收入多的生产事业。在劳动生产中，首先做到自给，然后做到自给有余，并为长期办学和建校打好物质基础。要搞好生产，贯彻脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的原则，必须要有一定的生产基地，开辟生产门路，才能给学习与生产劳动相结合创造条件，才能给生产自给和自给有余奠定雄厚的物质基础。过去一年多来的经验告诉我们，各分校和附属劳动技术学校，凡是划定了一定数量的土地、山林、牧场、鱼塘和小型工厂等生产基地的，那里的生产就搞得好，就能够做到生产自给或者自给有余。这不仅在经济上减少了国家负担，而且对于学生的生产和学习的积极性都有很大的激发与鼓励。因此，各地继续设法从国有土地、山林中和公社无力经营的土地、山林中（包括现耕地和开垦的荒地），给所在地的分校和附属劳动技术学校，解决生产所必需的土地、山林、牧场、鱼塘等生产资料，以便迅速地建立农、林、牧、副、渔、工等多种经营的基地，广泛开辟生产门路，首先作到生产自给，以至自给有余。这是保证办好共产主义劳动大学的物质基础，也是实现脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的一个重要方面。对于生产自给的要求，各分校和附属劳动技术学校，应当首先做到学生的伙食费和生活福利费的经费自给，待学校生产收入增加，再逐步用于基建和扩大再生产。学生的供给标准，应当根据各校生产情况而定，生产好的，可以高一些，生产差的，可以低一些。在目前条件下，一般应当做到每人每月伙食费和生活补助费十四元至二十元。
    三、加强党的领导，贯彻政治挂帅
    加强党的领导，贯彻政治挂帅，是进一步巩固提高和扩大共产主义劳动大学的根本保证。只有加强党的领导，才能贯彻政治挂帅，才能在教师和学生中广泛深入地进行社会主义—共产主义教育，才能有效地进行党的总路线、党的方针政策的教育，才能更有效地开展反对各种错误倾向的斗争；只有加强党的领导，才能保证正确地贯彻执行党的教育方针和群众路线的教学方法。同时，还必须使全体师生和干部，进一步认识“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，是我们党的社会主义—共产主义教育的根本方针，是普及和提高广大人民群众的文化水平、提高全体干部和广大人民群众的社会主义—共产主义觉悟，逐步缩小以至消除脑力劳动和体力劳动差别的一项重要措施；同时，还必须进一步认识实行勤工俭学、半工半读是贯彻党的教育方针的最有效办法。
    总括起来说，只要我们坚决地贯彻执行党的教育方针，认真做好上述三方面的工作，就可以搞好教学、搞好生产、搞好建校等工作，把共产主义劳动大学办得更好，并且在巩固提高的基础上继续扩大。要求到1961年，共产主义劳动大学总校、八十八个分校和十四个附属劳动技术学校的学生，发展到十万人。也就是说，我们从1958年到1961年打好基础，在这个基础上，每年有学生四万人毕业，招收新生四万人。这样，我们共产主义劳动大学，从1958年到1971年，在十四年时间内，就可以训练毕业学生四十万人，这就为我省广大山区和全省人民公社，培养出大批具有较高文化水平和具有一定理论水平与科学知识的大学生，为国家社会主义建设培养出大批人材，为建设现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义新山区，将作出巨大的贡献。
