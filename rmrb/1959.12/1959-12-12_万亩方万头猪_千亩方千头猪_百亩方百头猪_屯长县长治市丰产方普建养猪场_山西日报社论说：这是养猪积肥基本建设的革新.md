The Shanxi Daily Editorial Says: This is a Revolution in Pig Raising, Manure Accumulation, and Basic Construction

(Our Report) The Shanxi Daily published an editorial on the 8th titled "Building Pig Farms in High-Yield Plots is Highly Beneficial," elaborating on the significant meaning of building pig farms in high-yield plots in Tunliu County and Changzhi City. The editorial said: Building large-scale high-yield plots on vast areas of land, universally deep plowing, realizing water conservancy, and simultaneously building large pig farms within the high-yield plots – 10,000 pigs in 10,000 mu plots, 1,000 pigs in 1,000 mu plots – is a major revolution in pig raising, manure accumulation, and basic construction, tightly integrating soil, fertilizer, and water. This will have a huge impact on increasing the unit area yield of farmland next year.

Fertilizer and water are important parts of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production increase, and are two fundamental measures to continuously improve unit area yield. However, these two fundamental measures can only exert a significant role in complementary increase of production when they are closely integrated and fully implemented. However, in the past when engaging in water and fertilizer production construction during the winter, the two often became disconnected. When focusing on water, we only considered how to obtain more water, and when focusing on fertilizer, we only thought about how to accumulate more fertilizer. There was insufficient consideration of how to organically combine and closely link the two, starting from a planned effort to cultivate large areas of high-yield land. In this way, although efficiency greatly improved in the work of water or fertilizer itself, crops were often watered but fertilizer was still piled up in the village, fertilizer could not keep up, and yields still did not increase. The approach of Tunliu County and Changzhi City of raising pigs in the fields and building large pig farms in high-yield plots can tightly integrate water and fertilizer, and solve this contradiction well. Pig farms are built within the high-yield plots, and the soil and straw used for the pigsty can be obtained locally, some of the pig feed can be collected and processed locally, and the accumulated fertilizer can be applied locally, which can save a lot of labor for transporting fertilizer and reverse the past situation that people often said "half of agricultural labor is used for fertilizer." Building pig farms in high-yield plots is by no means accidental. For thousands of years, Chinese farmers have had experience in cultivating garden plots. The most basic feature of garden plots at that time was: a well and a thatched cellar, with a tight integration of water and fertilizer, diligent watering, irrigation, and fertilization, resulting in large harvests. The people of Tunliu County and Changzhi City are carrying on and developing the experience of Chinese farmers in cultivating garden plots by developing gardenization and water conservancy on large areas of land, and building pig farms in every plot, tightly integrating water and fertilizer. In order to further exploit the superiority of the "large-scale and public" nature of the people's communes, it is necessary to solve well the problem of closely integrating water and fertilizer to carry out basic construction on a large scale to create high yields. The approach of building pig farms in high-yield plots has universal significance and should be actively promoted in all localities according to their specific conditions.

According to Shanxi Daily News, while the masses of Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, are vigorously developing high-yield plots, they are also building large pig farms within the high-yield plots to ensure the fertilizer needed for the high-yield plots and promote the continued leap forward in agriculture next year.

Tunliu County turned disaster into bumper harvest this year, under the circumstances of 80 days of severe drought, and the unit yield of grain increased by 11.5% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Experience has proved that vigorously developing a large area of high-yield farmland is the fundamental way to rapidly increase agricultural output. Building large pig farms within the high-yield plots makes it easier to plant feed locally, process it locally, accumulate fertilizer locally, and apply it locally, which not only promotes mutual promotion and support between agriculture and animal husbandry, but also reduces the time for pulling soil and transporting fertilizer, greatly saving labor and animal power. Therefore, the Tunliu County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to launch a mass movement to develop 10,000-mu high-yield plots and build large pig farms in every plot, so as to achieve 10,000 pigs farms in 10,000-mu plots, 5,000 pigs farms in 5,000-mu plots, 1,000 pigs farms in 1,000-mu plots, and 100 pigs farms in 100-mu plots.

In order to ensure the complete realization of this plan, the Tunliu County Party Committee carried out layer-by-layer mobilization from the county to the commune and management area, vigorously opposed right-leaning, and stimulated the enthusiasm of the people of the county. Everyone was energetic and full of fighting spirit. On the basis of the improvement of the ideological awareness of the broad masses of people, specific deployments were made, and 150,000 laborers were organized to vigorously develop high-yield plots. As of the end of November, the county had established 15 10,000-mu high-yield plots, 766 5,000-mu, 1,000-mu, and 100-mu high-yield plots, with a total area of more than 360,000 mu; 8 3,000-pig farms, 10 2,000-pig farms, 96 1,000-pig farms, and 300 100-pig farms; 5 10,000-mu high-yield plots and 569 5,000-mu, 1,000-mu, and 100-mu high-yield plots are under construction; 2 10,000-pig farms, 5 5,000-pig farms, 51 1,000-pig farms, and 287 100-pig farms. At present, the people of the county are full of confidence, holding high the red flag of the General Line, riding the wind and waves and striding forward.

Furthermore, the movement to develop high-yield plots and build pig farms in every plot has achieved brilliant results in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province. As of recently, the people's communes in the city have built seven 10,000-mu high-yield plots, 15 5,000-mu plots, 70 1,000-mu plots, and 325 100-mu plots; seven 10,000-pig farms, 85 1,000-pig farms, and 190 100-pig farms have been built in the high-yield plots.

After the victorious conclusion of the autumn harvest, Changzhi City conducted a comprehensive summary of agricultural production this year with communes and management areas as units. On the basis of summarizing basic experiences, the Changzhi Municipal Party Committee put forward the "Six-izations" call for vigorously developing water and land gardenization, corn ditch fieldization, mountain land ridgeization, gully dam valleyization, saline-alkali land terrace fieldization, and sloping land terracing.

The Party Secretary of Nanchui Commune discovered during the vigorous "Six-izations" with the masses that building pig farms on 10,000-mu plots was a good way to save on fertilizer transportation and accumulate more fertilizer. The prefectural committee summarized this experience and quickly promoted it. As a result, the communes in the city immediately built large 10,000-pig farms on 10,000-mu plots, and large 1,000-pig farms and 100-pig farms on 1,000-mu and 100-mu plots. At present, the movement is in full swing. (Attached picture)

### 万亩方万头猪　千亩方千头猪　百亩方百头猪  屯长县长治市丰产方普建养猪场  山西日报社论说：这是养猪积肥基本建设的革新

    万亩方万头猪　千亩方千头猪　百亩方百头猪
    屯长县长治市丰产方普建养猪场
    山西日报社论说：这是养猪积肥基本建设的革新
    本报讯　山西日报8日以“丰产方建猪场大有好处”为题发表社论，阐述屯长县和长治市就丰产方建猪场的重要意义。社论说：在大面积土地上大搞丰产方，普遍深耕，实现水利化，同时在丰产方内大建养猪场，万亩方内建万头猪场，千亩方内建千头猪场，是养猪积肥基本建设的一项大革新，使土肥水紧密结合，这对明年提高农田单位面积产量，会有巨大的作用。
    肥、水是农业增产“八字宪法”的重要部分，是不断提高单位面积产量的两项根本措施。而这两项根本措施，又只有互相紧密结合，全面贯彻执行，才会发挥连因互补、促进增产的显著作用。但是，在往年冬季大闹水肥等生产建设的时候，两者常常互相脱节；抓水时只考虑如何抓到更多的水，抓肥时只想到如何抓到更多的肥。而从有计划的闹大面积丰产田出发，两者如何有机结合、紧密联系，考虑得很不够。这样，尽管在抓水或抓肥本身讲，效率大有提高，但往往是庄稼浇上水，肥料还堆在村里，肥料赶不上，产量还是上不去。而屯长县和长治市养猪到田间，在丰产方大建猪场的做法，就能使水肥紧密结合，很好地解决了这一矛盾。猪场建立在丰产方内，垫圈用的土和秸草可以就地取得，部分猪饲料可以就地采集和加工，而积下的肥料就地施用，又可以省下大量运肥的工，扭转过去人常说的“农业用工，肥占一半”的局面。丰产方建猪场，绝不是偶然的。我国农民千百年来就有种园田的经验。那时候园田土地最基本的标志是：一眼水井，一个茅窖，水肥紧密结合，勤浇勤灌粪，因而收获很大。屯长县和长治市人民在大面积土地上大搞园田化，大搞水利化，方方建猪场，水肥紧密结合，是我国农民搞园田经验的继承和发展。为了进一步发挥人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，在大面积的土地上创造高额丰产，水肥紧密结合大搞基本建设的问题，是需要很好解决的。丰产方建猪场的做法，具有普遍的意义，各地都应根据当地具体情况，因地制宜地积极推广。
    据山西日报消息　山西屯长县群众正在大搞丰产方的同时，在丰产方内大建养猪场，以保证丰产方所需肥料，促进明年农业继续跃进。
    屯长县今年在大旱八十天的情况下，灾年变丰年，粮食单位产量比大跃进的1958年增产了11.5％。经验证明，大搞大面积高额丰产田运动，是迅速提高农业产量的根本途径。而在丰产方内大建猪场，更便于就地种饲料，就地加工，就地积肥，就地施用，既使农牧相互促进，相互支援，又可减少拉土运肥时间，大大节省劳力和畜力。因此，中共屯长县委决定开展一个群众性的大搞万亩丰产方，方方大建养猪场的运动，做到万亩方万头猪场，五千亩方五千头猪场，千亩方千头猪场，百亩方百头猪场。
    屯长县委为确保这一计划完满实现，从县到公社、管理区，进行了层层发动，大反右倾，激发了全县人民的干劲，人人意气奋发、个个斗志昂扬。在广大人民思想觉悟提高的基础上，进行了具体部署，组织了十五万劳动大军大搞丰产方。截至11月底，全县已建立万亩丰产方十五个，五千亩、千亩、百亩丰产方七百六十六个，总面积达三十六万余亩；三千头养猪场八个，二千头猪场十个，千头猪场九十六个，百头猪场三百个；正在建立的万亩丰产方五个，五千亩、千亩、百亩丰产方五百六十九个；万头猪场二个，五千头猪场五个，千头猪场五十一个，百头猪场二百八十七个。目前全县人民满怀信心，高举总路线红旗，乘风破浪阔步前进。
    又讯　大搞丰产方，方方建猪场的农田基本建设运动，已在山西长治市获得辉煌成绩。截至最近，全市各人民公社已建成的万亩丰产方七个，五千亩方十五个，千亩方七十个，百亩方三百二十五个；在丰产方中已建起万头猪场七个，千头猪场八十五个，百头猪场一百九十个。
    长治市在胜利结束秋收后，以公社、管理区为单位，对今年农业生产进行了全面总结。在总结基本经验的基础上，中共长治市委提出了大搞水地园田化，玉米渠田化，山地地埂化，沟壑谷坊化，盐碱地台田化，坡地梯田化的“六化”号召。
    南垂公社党委书记在和群众一起大搞“六化”中，发现在万亩方上建猪场是个好办法，既能节省运肥工，又能多积肥。地委总结这一经验后迅速推广。于是全市各公社立即在万亩方上大建万头猪场，在千亩方上、百亩方上，大建千头猪场、百头猪场。目前，运动正在热火朝天地开展着。（附图片）
