The past year has been a year of vigorous development for the African national liberation movement, marking a watershed in the history of the African peoples' struggle for independence and liberation. During this year, from Algiers to the Cape of Good Hope, from the Atlantic coast to the shores of the Indian Ocean, the storm of struggle for national independence swept across the entire African continent. Its power was so great and its development so rapid that it was like a landslide overturning the sea, a raging fire consuming the plains.

In January of this year, the Congo, known as an "oasis of stability," first broke out in a great struggle against colonialism and for national independence. Soon the flames of this struggle spread throughout Nyasaland, Kenya, Rhodesia, Uganda, Tanganyika, and the entire central and southern Africa south of the equator. Throughout the entire year, the struggles of the African peoples for national liberation have risen one after another, continuously, demonstrating the heroic fighting spirit of the African peoples and their great determination not to rest until their goal is achieved. Recently, a new anti-colonialist struggle broke out again in Stanleyville, Congo, a general strike of 20,000 railway workers broke out in Kenya, and large-scale mass demonstrations broke out in Uganda and the Union of South Africa. Even in the tranquil "Land of the Mountains of the Moon," Rwanda-Urundi, a nationwide anti-colonialist struggle is now unfolding in full swing. Faced with this situation, even Western colonialists cannot help but exclaim that the great fire of burying the colonial system that has ignited on the African continent cannot be extinguished. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Leopoldville on November 11 admitted that "irresistible nationalism" "shakes the whole of Africa and invades the vast center of Black Africa." On the same day, the British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" reviewed the situation in Africa this year and could not help but sadly say that Africa is undergoing "earth-shattering changes" and that "the future of this rich and vast region is now changing."

The great development of the African national liberation movement in the past year shows that the masses of the African peoples have generally awakened and are becoming more and more mature politically and organizationally. An important sign is that the African working class, as an important political force, is playing an increasingly important role in the national liberation movement. Recently, the major strikes of Congolese workers and railway workers in Kenya, Uganda, and other places have had a distinct anti-colonialist character. In addition to the existing General Union of Black African Trade Unions with 200,000 members, the African Trade Union Conference held in the capital of Ghana a few days ago also prepared to organize an All-African Trade Union Federation to further unite the African working class and strengthen the anti-colonialist struggle. The program of action adopted by the African trade union representatives attending the meeting clearly pointed out that colonial rule has caused division, backwardness, poverty, and discrimination in Africa. They pledged to carry out fearless and self-sacrificing struggles for the political and economic liberation of the African continent. The strengthening of the unity and unification of the African labor movement will undoubtedly enable the working classes of African countries to better shoulder the historical mission of striving for national liberation.

The increasing political maturity of the African people is also manifested in the continuous strengthening of unity and joint action within and between the peoples of various countries. Although British colonialists arrested Banda, the leader of the African National Congress in Nyasaland, Belgian colonialists arrested Kasavubu, the leader of "Abako," and French colonialists killed Niobé, the Secretary-General of the Cameroon People's Union, and banned patriotic political parties in many places; however, the colonialists could not destroy the unity of the broad masses of people in these countries, nor could they end the organized struggle of the masses. On the contrary, the national liberation movements in many regions of Africa have developed into armed struggles and armed uprisings. In Nyasaland, the rebellious masses resisted the fully armed colonial army, aided by vampire-like aircraft, with stones, sticks, and spears. They set up roadblocks, destroyed roads and bridges, cut telephone lines, stormed into prisons to rescue their compatriots, and attacked colonial police patrols. At present, the people of Rwanda-Urundi are bravely resisting the brutal suppression of the colonial army. According to Western news agencies, more than 500 Africans have been killed and thousands arrested, but "Africans are fighting with spears and bows and arrows" against the colonial army with rifles and machine guns. Cameroon is a country with a population of only three million, but France has as many as 84,000 colonial troops and police; although more than 60,000 Cameroonian patriots have been imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps, the Cameroonian people's struggle for independence, democracy, and unity continues. People's guerrillas frequently appear around towns and attack the colonial armed forces. The heroic Algerian people's national liberation war has entered its sixth year. The Algerian People's Armed Forces, which had only 3,000 people five years ago, have now grown into a People's Armed Forces with more than 100,000 people and fairly modern equipment. In the five years of the Algerian people's resistance war, they have annihilated more than 100,000 enemies and liberated two-thirds of their territory. Since this spring, they have continuously crushed the offensives boasted by the French colonial army, putting the French colonialists in a passive and hopeless situation.

The universal awakening of the masses of the African peoples and their just struggle for national independence cannot be stopped by any reactionary force. On the entire African continent, there are a total of 59 countries and regions with more than 240 million people; at present, there are 42 countries that have achieved independence or are actively striving for independence, with a population of more than 235 million. This shows that the imperialist colonial system in Africa has been fundamentally shaken, and a completely independent and free new Africa is about to be born.

Of course, Western colonialists will still struggle frantically. In addition to stepping up bloody suppression of the African colonial people, they are also carrying out political deception against the African peoples. They are now proposing, one after another, deceptive schemes such as so-called "amending the constitution," increasing the number of African members in the "legislative bodies" used by the colonialists, "independence in stages," and "Euro-African community." Under the heavy blow of the African national independence movement, Western colonial countries are now stepping up collusion with each other to jointly suppress the African people. According to Western news agencies, Britain and France have reached an agreement on "long-term closer cooperation on African policy." Britain is also trying to establish a so-called "mini-North Atlantic Treaty Organization" in Africa. The European Parliamentary Conference, which ended a few days ago, also discussed ways for the six-nation European group to jointly control Africa from the economic, judicial, trade union, and social aspects.

In addition to these old Western European colonialists, the African people are also facing a serious threat from the new colonialists in the United States. This new colonialist, cloaked in the sheepskin of so-called "anti-colonialism" and "friend of Africa," is intensifying its heinous colonial expansion into Africa. In North Africa, French colonial troops used US-made aircraft to bomb peaceful Algerian villages; in West Africa, US weapons and ammunition were used to shoot through the chests of Cameroonian patriotic fighters; and the Belgian colonialists used US air bases to transport troops to the Congo to suppress the people's struggle there. US imperialism has established a vast network of naval and air force bases in Africa and signed a series of so-called "common defense agreements." Since this year, senior US generals and military delegations have visited Kenya, Congo, Angola, French West Africa, Cameroon, and the Union of South Africa to discuss so-called "defense" with local colonial authorities. At the same time, under the name of "aid" and "development," US monopoly capital has massively infiltrated Africa. US investment in Africa was only 150 million US dollars in 1954, but now it has reached 2 billion US dollars. Two hundred large American companies are participating in the insatiable plunder of African minerals, especially strategic resources. In addition, the United States is intensifying its political deception and political division of the African people through the activities of diplomatic, propaganda, cultural institutions, and religious groups, and is vigorously buying over and cultivating its agents in African countries, in order to pave the way for it to replace those old colonialists. All this shows that US imperialism has become an important pillar of the crumbling African colonial system and a sinister and vicious enemy of the African people.

After most of the Asian countries have broken away from the Western colonial system, Africa's significance as a source of profit, a source of cheap raw materials, and an important strategic base has been greatly increased for Western imperialist countries. The activities of Western colonialists to ravage and plunder the African people have continued for hundreds of years. It is very difficult to fully understand the scale of imperialist plunder of Africa because they always do this kind of thing secretly without publicly publishing any detailed statistics. However, for example, 98% of African diamonds are seized by imperialism, and more than 80% of the capitalist world's cobalt, more than half of its gold, about 40% of its chromium, and a large amount of important strategic raw materials such as copper, iron, manganese, and uranium are taken from Africa. It is no accident that some agents of the US ruling group are openly clamoring that "after losing Asia," Africa is the US imperialists' "last chance," "last line of defense," and "the most precious target of contention on earth." US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Satterthwaite said extremely bluntly to reporters from major US newspapers in 1958: "The United States will soon be able to compensate for its political failures in Asia and the Middle East, and Africa will provide us with an excellent opportunity for revenge." In fact, almost all imperialist countries have pinned their hopes on Africa, and a process of re-partitioning African colonies is actually underway. In order to compete for the oil fields in the Sahara Desert, in addition to the 40 companies and several large banks controlled by French monopoly capital, monopoly capital from the United States, Britain, West Germany, Italy, and other countries has poured into there and launched fierce competition. As soon as oil sources were discovered in Libya, 50 Western companies rushed there. West Germany's "New Ruhr Newspaper" wrote: If problems occur in the Western countries' plunder of oil resources in Asia and the Americas, "the oil stored and produced in Libya and Algeria is sufficient to supply Europe." It can be seen that Africa has become the last "reserve continent" for imperialism to plunder war resources and maintain colonial plunder.

Therefore, the vigorous development of the African national independence movement has made a great contribution to the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and for lasting peace.

The African people's great blow to the imperialist colonial system in Africa has directly weakened the war forces of the imperialist camp headed by the United States.

Imperialism is the common root of war and colonialism. Without equality among nations and the true independence and freedom of the peoples of all countries, there can be no solid and lasting peace. It is not difficult to see that the national liberation movements of the African peoples are a great new force in the sacred cause of the people of the world against imperialism and for lasting peace. At the same time, the struggle of the people of the world for lasting peace and against imperialist war policies is also support for the African people's struggle for independence. The struggle of the African people is not isolated. Although the imperialists are doing everything possible to obstruct it, they will always fail. The great struggle of the African people for independence will surely achieve final victory.

    非洲人民争取独立斗争伟大发展的一年
    冯之丹
    过去的一年，是非洲民族解放运动蓬勃发展的一年，它在非洲各民族要求独立解放的斗争史上具有划时代的意义。在这一年间，从阿尔及尔到好望角，从大西洋岸到印度洋之滨，争取民族独立斗争的风暴席卷了整个非洲大陆。其威力之大，发展之迅猛，有如排山倒海，烈火燎原。
    今年1月间，被称为“安定的绿洲”的刚果，首先爆发了反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的伟大斗争。不久这个斗争的火焰就燃遍了尼亚萨兰、怯尼亚、罗得西亚、乌干达、坦噶尼喀以及赤道以南的整个中南非洲。在整个的一年里，非洲各国人民争取民族解放的斗争，始终彼伏此起，连绵不绝，表现了非洲各国人民英勇的斗争精神和不达目的决不休止的伟大气概。最近，刚果斯坦利维尔市又爆发了新的反殖民主义斗争，在怯尼亚爆发了两万铁路工人总罢工的斗争，在乌干达和南非联邦也爆发了大规模的群众示威。即使在谧静的“月光山之国”的卢安达—乌隆迪，现在全国规模的反殖民主义斗争也在如火如荼地展开。面对着这种形势，就连西方殖民主义者也不得不惊呼，在非洲大陆上燃烧起来的这场埋葬殖民制度的大火，已经不能扑灭了。法新社11月11日发自利奥波德维尔的电讯承认，“势不可挡的民族主义”，“震撼着整个非洲，侵袭着黑非洲广阔大陆的中部”。同一天，英国保守党的“每日电讯报”在回顾了这一年的非洲情况以后，也不禁悲哀地说，非洲正在“翻天复地”，“这个富饶而广大的地区的前途现在正在变化中”。
    非洲民族解放运动一年来的伟大发展，表明了非洲各国的人民群众已经普遍觉醒，在政治上和组织上已经越来越成熟了。一个重要的标志是，非洲工人阶级作为一支重要的政治力量，在民族解放运动中发挥着越来越重要的作用。最近，刚果工人和怯尼亚、乌干达等地的铁路工人的大罢工，都具有鲜明的反对殖民主义的性质。除了已经存在的拥有二十万会员的黑非洲工会总联合会之外，前些天在加纳首都举行的非洲工会会议，还筹备组织全非工会联合会，以进一步团结非洲的工人阶级，加强反殖民主义的斗争。出席会议的非洲工会代表们通过的当前行动纲领中明确地指出，殖民统治造成了非洲的分裂、落后、贫困和歧视。他们保证将为非洲大陆的政治和经济解放进行无畏的和自我牺牲的斗争。非洲工人运动团结和统一的加强，无疑地将使非洲各国的工人阶级更好地担当起争取民族解放的历史使命。
  非洲人民群众政治上的日益成熟，还表现在各国人民内部和各国人民之间的团结和联合行动的不断加强。尽管英国殖民主义者在尼亚萨兰逮捕了非洲人国民大会领袖班达，比利时殖民者曾经逮捕了“阿巴科”领袖卡萨武布，法国殖民者杀害了喀麦隆人民联盟总书记尼奥勃，并在许多地方取缔了爱国政党；可是，殖民主义者无法摧毁这些国家广泛阶层人民的团结，无法结束人民群众的有组织的斗争。正相反，非洲许多地区的民族解放运动，已经发展成武装斗争和具有武装起义性质。在尼亚萨兰，起义的群众以石头、棍棒和长矛反抗有吸血鬼式飞机助威的全副武装的殖民军，他们设路障，破坏公路和桥梁，割断电话线，并冲入监狱解救同胞，袭击殖民者的警察巡逻队。目前，卢安达—乌隆迪的人民正在英勇地抵抗殖民军残暴镇压。据西方通讯社报道，非洲人已经有五百多人被杀死，上千人遭到逮捕，可是“非洲人用长矛和弓箭”抗击着拥有步枪和机关枪的殖民军。喀麦隆是个只有三百万人口的国家，可是法国的殖民军警竟有八万四千人之多；虽然有六万以上的喀麦隆爱国者被关入监狱和集中营，但喀麦隆人民争取独立、民主和统一的斗争一直继续着。人民游击队经常地出没于城镇周围，袭击殖民者的武装。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争，已经进入了第六个年头。阿尔及利亚人民武装力量，在五年前只有三千人，但是今天已经发展壮大成为拥有十余万人和相当现代化装备的人民武装部队了。阿尔及利亚人民抗战五年，歼敌十余万人，解放了三分之二的国土。今春以来，他们又连续地粉碎了法国殖民军所吹嘘的攻势，而使法国殖民者陷于被动和无望的处境。
    非洲各国人民群众的普遍觉醒，他们为争取民族独立的正义斗争，是任何反动势力所阻挡不了的。在整个非洲大陆，总共有五十九个国家和地区，二亿四千多万人；目前已经取得独立或者正在积极争取独立的国家有四十二个，人口达到了二亿三千五百多万人。这说明帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系已经根本动摇，一个完全独立自由的新非洲快要诞生了。
    当然，西方殖民主义者还会进行疯狂挣扎的。他们除了加紧对非洲殖民地人民进行血腥镇压之外，还对非洲各国人民进行着政治诱骗。它们目前正一个接着一个地提出所谓“修改宪法”、增加殖民者御用的“立法机构”内非洲籍议员、“分阶段独立”以及“欧非共同体”之类的欺骗方案。在非洲民族独立运动的沉重打击下，现在西方殖民国家正在加紧互相勾结起来，共同镇压非洲人民。据西方通讯社透露，英法两国已经就“长期地在非洲政策上进行更加紧密的合作”问题达成协议。英国还企图在非洲建立一个所谓“小型北大西洋公约组织”。前几天结束的欧洲议会会议，也讨论了六国欧洲集团从经济、司法、工会和社会等方面共同控制非洲的办法。
    除了这些老牌的西欧殖民主义者之外，非洲人民还面对着美国新殖民主义者的严重威胁。这个新殖民主义者披着所谓“反殖民主义”和“非洲的朋友”的羊皮，正向非洲加紧进行穷凶极恶的殖民扩张。在北非，法国殖民军队用美制飞机轰炸阿尔及利亚的和平村庄；在西非，美国的武器和弹药被用来射穿喀麦隆爱国志士的胸膛；而比利时殖民者正是借用了美国空军基地把军队运到刚果去镇压那里的人民斗争。美国帝国主义在非洲建立了庞大的海空军基地网，签订了一系列所谓“共同防御协定”。美国高级将领和军事代表团今年以来曾先后去怯尼亚、刚果、安哥拉、法属西非、喀麦隆和南非联邦等地进行了“访问”，同当地的殖民当局商谈了所谓“防务”。同时，在“援助”和“开发”的名义下，美国垄断资本大规模地渗入非洲。美国在非洲的投资1954年还只有一亿五千万美元，现在则已达到了二十亿美元。两百家美国大公司正在参加着对非洲矿藏，特别是战略资源的贪得无厌的掠夺。除此以外，美国还通过外交、宣传、文化机构和宗教团体的活动，加紧对非洲人民进行政治欺骗和政治分化，并且在非洲国家中大力收买和培养它的代理人，以为它取代那些老牌殖民主义者的地位铺平道路。这一切都说明，美国帝国主义已经成为摇摇欲坠的非洲殖民体系的重要支柱和非洲人民的阴险凶恶的敌人。
    在亚洲大部分国家摆脱了西方殖民体系以后，对西方帝国主义国家来说，非洲作为利润的来源、廉价的原料产地和重要的战略基地，它的意义是无比的提高了。西方殖民主义者摧残和掠夺非洲人民的活动，已经继续了几百年之久，要完全弄清帝国主义掠夺非洲的规模，是很困难的，因为它们干这种勾当的时候，总是偷偷摸摸的，而不公开发表任何详细的统计材料。但是，例如非洲的金刚石有98％被帝国主义所攫取，而资本主义世界80％以上的钴、半数以上的黄金、40％左右的铬，以及大量的铜、铁、锰、铀等重要战略原料，都是取自非洲的。美国统治集团的一些代理人，就在公开叫嚷什么
  “失去亚洲以后”，非洲是美帝国主义的“最后机会”、“最后的防线”和“地球上最珍贵的争夺目标”等等，绝不是偶然的。美国负责非洲事务助理国务卿萨克斯威特1958年对美国各主要大报记者发表谈话，极其露骨地说：“美国不久将能补偿它在亚洲和中东政治上的失败，非洲将为我们提供出色的报复机会”。事实上，几乎所有的帝国主义国家都把自己的命运寄于非洲，一个重新分割非洲殖民地的过程正在实际上进行中。为了争夺撒哈拉沙漠的油田，除了法国垄断资本控制的四十个公司和几家大银行之外，美国、英国和西德、意大利等垄断资本都涌向那里，展开剧烈的竞争。利比亚一发现油源，立即就有五十家西方公司到那里去挤轧。西德“新鲁尔报”这样写道：万一西方国家对亚洲和美洲的石油资源的掠夺发生了问题，“利比亚和阿尔及利亚储藏和生产的石油足够供应欧洲”。由此可见，非洲在帝国主义的眼里，已成了它们掠夺战争资源和维持殖民主义掠夺的最后的“后备大陆”。
    因此，非洲民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，对于全世界人民反对帝国主义和争取持久和平的斗争，作出了巨大的贡献。
    非洲人民给帝国主义在非洲的殖民制度的巨大打击，直接削弱了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的战争势力。
    帝国主义是战争和殖民主义的共同根源。没有各民族之间的平等和各国人民的真正的独立和自由，也就不可能有巩固的持久和平。这就不难看出，非洲各国人民的民族解放运动，正是全世界人民反对帝国主义、争取持久和平的神圣事业中的一支伟大的生力军。同时，全世界人民争取持久和平、反对帝国主义战争政策的斗争，也是对非洲人民争取独立运动的支援。非洲人民的斗争不是孤立的，尽管帝国主义者千方百计地加以阻挠，但它们总是要失败的，非洲人民争取独立的伟大斗争一定能够取得最后胜利。
