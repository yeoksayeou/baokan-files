The past year has been a year of vigorous development for the African national liberation movement, marking a watershed in the history of the African peoples' struggle for independence and liberation. During this year, from Algiers to the Cape of Good Hope, from the Atlantic coast to the shores of the Indian Ocean, the storm of struggle for national independence swept across the entire African continent. Its power was so great and its development so rapid that it was like a landslide overturning the sea, a raging fire consuming the plains.

In January of this year, the Congo, known as an "oasis of stability," first broke out in a great struggle against colonialism and for national independence. Soon the flames of this struggle spread throughout Nyasaland, Kenya, Rhodesia, Uganda, Tanganyika, and the entire central and southern Africa south of the equator. Throughout the entire year, the struggles of the African peoples for national liberation have risen one after another, continuously, demonstrating the heroic fighting spirit of the African peoples and their great determination not to rest until their goal is achieved. Recently, a new anti-colonialist struggle broke out again in Stanleyville, Congo, a general strike of 20,000 railway workers broke out in Kenya, and large-scale mass demonstrations broke out in Uganda and the Union of South Africa. Even in the tranquil "Land of the Mountains of the Moon," Rwanda-Urundi, a nationwide anti-colonialist struggle is now unfolding in full swing. Faced with this situation, even Western colonialists cannot help but exclaim that the great fire of burying the colonial system that has ignited on the African continent cannot be extinguished. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Leopoldville on November 11 admitted that "irresistible nationalism" "shakes the whole of Africa and invades the vast center of Black Africa." On the same day, the British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" reviewed the situation in Africa this year and could not help but sadly say that Africa is undergoing "earth-shattering changes" and that "the future of this rich and vast region is now changing."

The great development of the African national liberation movement in the past year shows that the masses of the African peoples have generally awakened and are becoming more and more mature politically and organizationally. An important sign is that the African working class, as an important political force, is playing an increasingly important role in the national liberation movement. Recently, the major strikes of Congolese workers and railway workers in Kenya, Uganda, and other places have had a distinct anti-colonialist character. In addition to the existing General Union of Black African Trade Unions with 200,000 members, the African Trade Union Conference held in the capital of Ghana a few days ago also prepared to organize an All-African Trade Union Federation to further unite the African working class and strengthen the anti-colonialist struggle. The program of action adopted by the African trade union representatives attending the meeting clearly pointed out that colonial rule has caused division, backwardness, poverty, and discrimination in Africa. They pledged to carry out fearless and self-sacrificing struggles for the political and economic liberation of the African continent. The strengthening of the unity and unification of the African labor movement will undoubtedly enable the working classes of African countries to better shoulder the historical mission of striving for national liberation.

The increasing political maturity of the African people is also manifested in the continuous strengthening of unity and joint action within and between the peoples of various countries. Although British colonialists arrested Banda, the leader of the African National Congress in Nyasaland, Belgian colonialists arrested Kasavubu, the leader of "Abako," and French colonialists killed Niob√©, the Secretary-General of the Cameroon People's Union, and banned patriotic political parties in many places; however, the colonialists could not destroy the unity of the broad masses of people in these countries, nor could they end the organized struggle of the masses. On the contrary, the national liberation movements in many regions of Africa have developed into armed struggles and armed uprisings. In Nyasaland, the rebellious masses resisted the fully armed colonial army, aided by vampire-like aircraft, with stones, sticks, and spears. They set up roadblocks, destroyed roads and bridges, cut telephone lines, stormed into prisons to rescue their compatriots, and attacked colonial police patrols. At present, the people of Rwanda-Urundi are bravely resisting the brutal suppression of the colonial army. According to Western news agencies, more than 500 Africans have been killed and thousands arrested, but "Africans are fighting with spears and bows and arrows" against the colonial army with rifles and machine guns. Cameroon is a country with a population of only three million, but France has as many as 84,000 colonial troops and police; although more than 60,000 Cameroonian patriots have been imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps, the Cameroonian people's struggle for independence, democracy, and unity continues. People's guerrillas frequently appear around towns and attack the colonial armed forces. The heroic Algerian people's national liberation war has entered its sixth year. The Algerian People's Armed Forces, which had only 3,000 people five years ago, have now grown into a People's Armed Forces with more than 100,000 people and fairly modern equipment. In the five years of the Algerian people's resistance war, they have annihilated more than 100,000 enemies and liberated two-thirds of their territory. Since this spring, they have continuously crushed the offensives boasted by the French colonial army, putting the French colonialists in a passive and hopeless situation.

The universal awakening of the masses of the African peoples and their just struggle for national independence cannot be stopped by any reactionary force. On the entire African continent, there are a total of 59 countries and regions with more than 240 million people; at present, there are 42 countries that have achieved independence or are actively striving for independence, with a population of more than 235 million. This shows that the imperialist colonial system in Africa has been fundamentally shaken, and a completely independent and free new Africa is about to be born.

Of course, Western colonialists will still struggle frantically. In addition to stepping up bloody suppression of the African colonial people, they are also carrying out political deception against the African peoples. They are now proposing, one after another, deceptive schemes such as so-called "amending the constitution," increasing the number of African members in the "legislative bodies" used by the colonialists, "independence in stages," and "Euro-African community." Under the heavy blow of the African national independence movement, Western colonial countries are now stepping up collusion with each other to jointly suppress the African people. According to Western news agencies, Britain and France have reached an agreement on "long-term closer cooperation on African policy." Britain is also trying to establish a so-called "mini-North Atlantic Treaty Organization" in Africa. The European Parliamentary Conference, which ended a few days ago, also discussed ways for the six-nation European group to jointly control Africa from the economic, judicial, trade union, and social aspects.

In addition to these old Western European colonialists, the African people are also facing a serious threat from the new colonialists in the United States. This new colonialist, cloaked in the sheepskin of so-called "anti-colonialism" and "friend of Africa," is intensifying its heinous colonial expansion into Africa. In North Africa, French colonial troops used US-made aircraft to bomb peaceful Algerian villages; in West Africa, US weapons and ammunition were used to shoot through the chests of Cameroonian patriotic fighters; and the Belgian colonialists used US air bases to transport troops to the Congo to suppress the people's struggle there. US imperialism has established a vast network of naval and air force bases in Africa and signed a series of so-called "common defense agreements." Since this year, senior US generals and military delegations have visited Kenya, Congo, Angola, French West Africa, Cameroon, and the Union of South Africa to discuss so-called "defense" with local colonial authorities. At the same time, under the name of "aid" and "development," US monopoly capital has massively infiltrated Africa. US investment in Africa was only 150 million US dollars in 1954, but now it has reached 2 billion US dollars. Two hundred large American companies are participating in the insatiable plunder of African minerals, especially strategic resources. In addition, the United States is intensifying its political deception and political division of the African people through the activities of diplomatic, propaganda, cultural institutions, and religious groups, and is vigorously buying over and cultivating its agents in African countries, in order to pave the way for it to replace those old colonialists. All this shows that US imperialism has become an important pillar of the crumbling African colonial system and a sinister and vicious enemy of the African people.

After most of the Asian countries have broken away from the Western colonial system, Africa's significance as a source of profit, a source of cheap raw materials, and an important strategic base has been greatly increased for Western imperialist countries. The activities of Western colonialists to ravage and plunder the African people have continued for hundreds of years. It is very difficult to fully understand the scale of imperialist plunder of Africa because they always do this kind of thing secretly without publicly publishing any detailed statistics. However, for example, 98% of African diamonds are seized by imperialism, and more than 80% of the capitalist world's cobalt, more than half of its gold, about 40% of its chromium, and a large amount of important strategic raw materials such as copper, iron, manganese, and uranium are taken from Africa. It is no accident that some agents of the US ruling group are openly clamoring that "after losing Asia," Africa is the US imperialists' "last chance," "last line of defense," and "the most precious target of contention on earth." US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Satterthwaite said extremely bluntly to reporters from major US newspapers in 1958: "The United States will soon be able to compensate for its political failures in Asia and the Middle East, and Africa will provide us with an excellent opportunity for revenge." In fact, almost all imperialist countries have pinned their hopes on Africa, and a process of re-partitioning African colonies is actually underway. In order to compete for the oil fields in the Sahara Desert, in addition to the 40 companies and several large banks controlled by French monopoly capital, monopoly capital from the United States, Britain, West Germany, Italy, and other countries has poured into there and launched fierce competition. As soon as oil sources were discovered in Libya, 50 Western companies rushed there. West Germany's "New Ruhr Newspaper" wrote: If problems occur in the Western countries' plunder of oil resources in Asia and the Americas, "the oil stored and produced in Libya and Algeria is sufficient to supply Europe." It can be seen that Africa has become the last "reserve continent" for imperialism to plunder war resources and maintain colonial plunder.

Therefore, the vigorous development of the African national independence movement has made a great contribution to the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and for lasting peace.

The African people's great blow to the imperialist colonial system in Africa has directly weakened the war forces of the imperialist camp headed by the United States.

Imperialism is the common root of war and colonialism. Without equality among nations and the true independence and freedom of the peoples of all countries, there can be no solid and lasting peace. It is not difficult to see that the national liberation movements of the African peoples are a great new force in the sacred cause of the people of the world against imperialism and for lasting peace. At the same time, the struggle of the people of the world for lasting peace and against imperialist war policies is also support for the African people's struggle for independence. The struggle of the African people is not isolated. Although the imperialists are doing everything possible to obstruct it, they will always fail. The great struggle of the African people for independence will surely achieve final victory.
