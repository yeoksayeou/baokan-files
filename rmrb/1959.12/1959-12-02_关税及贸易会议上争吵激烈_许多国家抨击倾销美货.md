    Report:
    Fierce Disputes at the GATT Meeting
    Many Countries Criticize Dumping of American Goods

    This newspaper reports that the fifteenth session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, lasting nearly four weeks, closed in Tokyo on November 20. The meeting was attended by 350 representatives from the organization's thirty-seven member states and forty-five non-member states. The agenda for this meeting included forty items, but the central issue was "trade liberalization."

    Under the banner of "trade liberalization," the American representative Dillon, who attended the meeting, demanded that other countries relax import restrictions on American goods. However, the American position was not only met with a cold reception from many industrialized capitalist countries, but also with criticism from representatives of many underdeveloped countries. Representatives from Australia, New Zealand, the Federation of South Africa, Peru, Finland, and Denmark pointed out the fact that the United States consistently restricts the import of agricultural products from other countries. Representatives from some underdeveloped countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America criticized the discriminatory measures taken by economically developed capitalist countries against the import of agricultural products and raw materials from underdeveloped countries, and expressed concern about the instability of raw material prices. The Indian representative, Kanungo, said: "Some countries believe that the low wages in underdeveloped countries constitute sufficient reason to exclude their goods. We cannot ignore this position." Representatives from Nigeria and Ghana expressed indignation at the fact that West Germany and the Netherlands, participants in the Western European "Common Market," would further implement discriminatory measures against them.

    The two economic blocs, the "Little Free Trade Area" led by Britain and the "Common Market" centered on West Germany, also argued at this meeting. The British representative, Gore-Booth, spoke at the meeting, fiercely attacking the "Common Market" six countries' plan to grant special tariff treatment to their overseas territories. The Japanese representative, Aiichiro Fujiyama, expressed unease at the establishment of economic blocs in Europe in his speech at the meeting. He also demanded that fourteen member states, including Britain and France, abolish trade discrimination against Japan. Although Japan's request was supported by the United States, it failed to materialize due to opposition from countries such as Britain and France. Conversely, the United States forced Japan to agree to remove import restrictions on the dollar area from January next year.

    关税及贸易会议上争吵激烈
    许多国家抨击倾销美货
    本报讯　为期近四周的关税及贸易总协定第十五届会议在11月20日于东京闭幕。出席这次会议的有这个组织的三十七个成员国和四十五个非成员国代表三百五十人。这次会议的议题达四十项，但中心是“贸易自由化”问题。
    出席会议的美国代表狄龙在“贸易自由化”的口号下，要求其他国家放宽对美国货的入口限制。但是，美国的立场不仅遭到许多工业发达的资本主义国家的冷淡对待，而且受到许多不发达国家代表的抨击。澳大利亚、新西兰、南非联邦、秘鲁、芬兰和丹麦的代表指出美国一贯限制其它国家的农产品入口的事实。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲一些不发达国家的代表抨击经济发达的资本主义国家对从不发达的国家进口农产品和原料采取歧视措施，并且对原料价格的不稳定表示忧虑。印度代表卡农戈说：“一些国家认为，不发达的国家工资低廉，这就构成了排斥它们货物的充分理由。对这种立场，我们不能置之不理。”尼日利亚和加纳的代表对西欧“共同市场”参加国西德和荷兰对它们将进一步实行歧视措施表示愤慨。
    以英国为首的“小自由贸易区”和以西德为核心的“共同市场”两个经济集团之间在这次会议上也发生争吵。英国代表戈尔—布思在会议上发言猛烈攻击“共同市场”六国计划要给予它们的海外属地的特别关税待遇。日本代表藤山爱一郎在会议上的发言中对在欧洲建立经济集团表示不安。他还要求英、法等十四个成员国取消对日本实行的贸易歧视。日本的要求虽然有美国撑腰，但由于受到英、法等国家的反对而未能实现。相反的，美国却迫使日本答应，从明年1月取消对美元区的进口限制。
