　　Niu Wenqing Creates Hand-Operated Water Pump: One Person Can Pump 200 Jin of Water Per Minute

    (Our Dispatch) A "hand-operated universal water pump" with a large pumping capacity, simple structure, and easy operation has been successfully manufactured in Tangzhuang Brigade, Heji Commune, Suixian County, Henan. This water pump provides new equipment for self-flowing water for commune canteens, flour mills, cattle sheds, pig and sheep farms, and farmland irrigation. In order to promote this simple pumping tool, the Kaifeng Prefectural Committee and the Suixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting in Tangzhuang Brigade.

    This water pump was collectively created by Niu Wenqing, a worker in the woodworking factory of Tangzhuang Brigade, Heji Commune, and others. Niu Wenqing is a young worker with no particularly high technical skills, but he brought into play the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and together with the workers of the entire factory, after eight experiments, finally succeeded in creating it. This water pump only requires one person to operate and can pump 200 jin of water per minute, which can meet the water needs of a canteen with 200 people in 20 minutes. It not only improves work efficiency and saves labor but also reduces physical labor. In addition to self-flowing water for canteen use, this water pump can also be used for irrigation. The masses praised it, saying, "The water pump is a treasure; a press of the hand, and the water arrives. It is convenient for drinking water and irrigating fields, and from now on, we no longer have to carry water."

    The hand-operated universal water pump has a simple structure, consisting of seven parts: a water tank, a cylinder, a connecting rod piston, a "kowtow bug" (lever), an inlet pipe, a valve, and a faucet. When manufacturing, only a few bamboo poles, two sections of waterwheel cylinders, a large water bucket, and a small amount of wood are needed, costing about 20 yuan.

    Currently, more than 2,300 hand-operated universal water pumps have been manufactured throughout the county, and more than 90% of canteens, cattle sheds, pig and sheep farms, flour mills, etc., have achieved self-flowing water. According to preliminary statistics, the county can save more than 13,000 laborers.

    Explanation: The hand-operated universal water pump is divided into seven parts:

    1.  Water Tank: Used for storing water. An opening is made in the center of the bottom to connect the cylinder; another opening or multiple openings can be made on the side to connect the outlet pipe, leading to various water use locations.

    2.  Cylinder: Using three to four chi of iron sheet pipe from a Liberation-style waterwheel, the upper opening is tightly connected to the opening at the bottom of the water tank, avoiding water and air leaks; the lower opening is connected to the inlet pipe (bamboo pipe).

    3.  Connecting Rod Piston: Installed in the cylinder, connected to the "kowtow bug" (lever) at the top.

    4.  The lower end of the "kowtow bug" is connected to the handle. Both the handle and the horizontal bar of the "kowtow bug" have movable shafts in the middle.

    5.  Inlet Pipe: Made of bamboo pipe, one end leading into the well and the other end connected to the cylinder. Each bamboo pipe connection needs to be wrapped tightly with rubber to prevent water and air leaks.

    6.  Valve: The upper valve is installed at the upper opening of the cylinder, the middle valve is installed at the connection between the cylinder and the inlet pipe, and the lower valve is installed at the lower opening of the inlet pipe. Its main function is to seal the pipeline to prevent backflow of water and to regulate the atmospheric pressure in the pipe and bear the pressure of the water in sections to increase the flow rate and pumping head.

    7.  Faucet: Installed at the end of the outlet pipe. When using, press the handle to make the "kowtow bug" move up and down, driving the connecting rod piston to move up and down. After the air in the cylinder is exhausted, water is pressed into the cylinder; when the piston is pressed down, the middle valve and the lower valve are closed simultaneously, the upper valve is opened, and water enters the water tank. The water stored in the water tank flows to various water use locations through the outlet pipe. Turning the faucet, the water flows out. (Attached picture)

　　牛文清创造手压抽水机  一人一分钟抽水二百斤
    本报讯　一种抽水量大、构造简单、操作轻便的“手压万能抽水机”，在河南睢县河集公社汤庄大队制造成功。这种抽水机给公社食堂、粉坊、牛舍、猪羊场等自流用水及农田灌溉提供了新的装备。为了推广这一简易抽水工具，中共开封地委和睢县县委在汤庄大队召开了现场会议。
    这种抽水机，是河集公社汤庄大队木工厂工人牛文清等集体创造的。牛文清是个青年工人，技术水平并不很高，但是他发挥敢想敢干的共产主义风格，和全厂工人一起，经过八次试验，终于创造成功。这种抽水机只用一人操作，每分钟可抽水二百斤，二十分钟就可满足一个二百人吃饭的食堂用水。不仅提高了工效、节省了劳力，而且减轻了体力劳动。这种抽水机除食堂用水可以自流外，还可用来灌田，群众称赞地说：“抽水机，是个宝，手一按，水就到，吃水灌田多方便，从此再不把水挑。”
    手压万能抽水机构造简单，共分水柜、唧筒、连杆活塞、磕头虫、进水管、活门、水龙头等七个部分。制造时，只用几根竹竿，两节水车筒子，一个大水桶和少量的木料，价值约二十元。
    目前，全县已制造手压万能抽水机二千三百多部，90％以上的食堂、牛舍、猪羊场、粉坊等，都已作到用水自流。据初步统计，全县共可节省劳力一万三千多人。
    说明：手压万能抽水机共分七个部分：
    一、水柜：作储水之用。底部正中开一个口，连接唧筒；旁侧可另开一口或多口，连接出水管，通往各用水场所。
    二、唧筒：利用解放式水车铁皮管子三至四尺，上口与水柜底部开口紧密连接，要避免漏水漏气；下口与进水管（竹管）连接。
    三、连杆活塞：装在唧筒内，上与“磕头虫”（杠杆）连接。
    四、“磕头虫”下端与压把连接。压把和磕头虫横杆中间均有活动轴。
    五、进水管：是用竹管作的，一端通往井内，另一端与唧筒连接。每节竹管连接处，需用橡皮缠紧，以防漏水漏气。
    六、活门：上活门装在唧筒上口，中活门装在唧筒与进水管连接处，下活门装在进水管下口。其主要作用，是封闭管路防止回水。并能调节管内大气压力和分段承受水的压力，以提高流速和抽水扬程。
    七、水龙头：安在出水管末端。使用时，手压压把，使磕头虫上下活动，以带动连杆活塞上下活动，唧筒内空气排出后，水即压入唧筒；活塞下压时，中活门和下活门同时封闭，上活门启开，水即进入水柜。水柜储的水，通过出水管流到各用水场所，扭动水龙头，水即流出。（附图片）
