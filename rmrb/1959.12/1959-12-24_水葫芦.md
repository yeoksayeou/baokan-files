The growing period of water hyacinth is as long as ten months (the fastest growth is from June to July), and the suitable temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, but it will not freeze to death even at minus 5 degrees Celsius. With proper management, the annual yield per mu can reach about 160,000 to 200,000 jin. (Attached picture)
