Prague Dispatch: In the past year of 1959, the Czechoslovak working people have once again added a glorious page to the history of the country's socialist construction through their diligent labor. According to the materials already available from the State Planning Commission, Czechoslovakia's industrial sector will overfulfill its production plan for this year by 101.5%, with a total output value increasing by approximately 11% compared to last year. Among this, the production of the means of production is increasing even faster, and the scale of construction work also exceeds last year's level by more than 15%.

The products of the metallurgical and machinery industries, which are the foundation of the national economy, have increased by 15% compared to last year, and the absolute increase in production is almost equal to half of the increase in the entire industrial sector. In the metallurgical industry sector, the annual production task will be overfulfilled by 3% this year. The total output value of factories and mines under the Ministry of Metallurgy will increase by 12.5% compared to last year. This year's pig iron production will reach 4.3 million tons, an increase of 13% compared to last year; steel production will rise to approximately 6.2 million tons, an increase of 11.8% compared to last year. Heavy machinery industrial products will increase by 15.7% compared to last year, and general machinery industrial products will increase by 18%.

The rapid development of the metallurgical and machinery industries has placed higher demands on the fuel and power industries such as coal and electricity. This year, Czechoslovakia's coal production is in good condition, with a total production of 25 million tons of hard coal and 50 million tons of lignite, making Czechoslovakia the world's leading country in coal production per capita. This year's electricity production has increased by 11.9% compared to last year, greatly promoting the progress of electrification. This year, Prague, České Budějovice, and Pilsen and other states have completed the task of electrifying the entire state one year ahead of schedule.

The chemical industry is also moving towards world levels, and the state gives priority to the development of various chemical products related to the national economy and people's livelihood, such as man-made fibers, plastics, nitrogen fertilizers, and phosphate fertilizers. The production of the entire chemical industry sector is expected to increase by 11% compared to last year.

The further improvement of labor productivity and the continuous reduction of production costs are significant features of Czechoslovakia's industrial production this year. In the entire industrial sector, the labor productivity of each worker has increased by more than approximately 8% compared to last year; and the average cost of industrial production this year has been reduced by approximately 2.26%.

The achievements are due, on the one hand, to the industrial sector's special emphasis this year on the adoption of new technologies and the improvement of the mechanization level of industrial equipment, and also to the implementation of new management and planning systems in the industrial sector, which has greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor and improved their sense of responsibility.

At present, the Czechoslovak working people are actively participating in the formulation of the 1960 plan and the discussion of the enormous tasks stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan. They have expressed that they will not only successfully complete the 1960 plan and the Third Five-Year Plan, but also lay a good foundation for the future, even more magnificent tasks with ever-changing production achievements.

　　捷社会主义建设增添光辉新页
    今年工业产值将增长11％　生产资料生产提高更快
    本报布拉格27日电　在即将过去的1959年中，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民又以自己辛勤的劳动在完成祖国社会主义建设的历史上写下了光辉的一页。根据国家计划委员会已有的材料，捷克斯洛伐克今年工业部门的生产计划将以101.5％超额完成，总产值比去年增长约11％，其中生产资料的生产提高得更快，建筑工作的规模也超出去年水平15％以上。
    作为国民经济基础的冶金和机械工业部门的产品比去年增长了15％，绝对增产数字几乎等于整个工业部门增产量的一半。在冶金工业部门，今年将超计划3％完成全年的生产任务。冶金工业部所属厂矿的总产值将比去年增长12.5％。今年生铁产量达四百三十万吨，比去年增长13％；钢的产量上升到约六百二十万吨，比去年增长11.8％。重型机械工业产品比去年增长15.7％，一般机械工业产品将增长18％。
    冶金和机械工业部门的迅速发展，对煤、电等燃料、动力工业提出了更高的要求。今年捷克斯洛伐克煤的生产情况良好，共生产了硬煤二千五百万吨，褐煤五千万吨，使捷克斯洛伐克在煤的生产方面按人口平均计算已占世界第一位。今年的电力生产比去年增长了11.9％，大大促进了电气化事业的进展。今年，布拉格、契斯克·布德约维泽和比尔森等州已经提前一年完成了全州电气化的任务。
    化学工业也正向着世界水平前进，国家优先发展有关国计民生的各种化学产品，如人造纤维、塑料以及氮肥、磷肥等。今年整个化学工业部门的生产比去年预计要增长11％。
    劳动生产率的进一步提高和生产成本的不断下降是今年捷克斯洛伐克工业生产中显著的特点。在整个工业部门中，每个工人的劳动生产率比去年约提高8％还多；而今年工业生产的成本平均约降低2.26％。
    这些成绩的取得，一方面是由于今年工业部门特别重视新技术的采用和提高工业设备的机械化水平，同时也由于在工业部门贯彻了新的管理和计划制度，大大鼓舞了工人们的劳动积极性和提高了他们的责任感。
    目前捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民正在积极参加制定1960年计划和对第三个五年计划所规定的巨大任务的讨论，他们表示不仅要胜利完成1960年计划和第三个五年计划，并且要以日新月异的生产成就为未来的更为宏伟的任务奠下良好的基础。
