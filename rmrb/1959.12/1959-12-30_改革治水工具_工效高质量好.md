Guizhou Completes Over 50,000 Water Projects

Xinhua News Agency Report: The mass water conservancy construction movement in mountainous Guizhou Province has achieved tremendous success. After two months of hard work and ingenuity, as of December 20, over 52,000 water conservancy projects of various sizes have been completed, expanding the irrigated area by 1.6 million mu.

In this year's large-scale water conservancy efforts, a high-efficiency movement centered on technological innovation was widely launched. The average efficiency of earth and stone work in the province has increased from 1 cubic meter per person per day at the beginning to 3.5 cubic meters. In Changshun County, "quality, efficiency, and safety" competitions were conducted at 329 water conservancy construction sites throughout the county, resulting in the emergence of over 1,300 model water conservancy builders, making it a red banner for high efficiency in water conservancy in Guizhou Province. At the ponds and reservoirs construction sites in this county, the average efficiency of earth and stone excavation per person per day has reached 11.4 cubic meters.

Jilin Utilizes Ice and Snow for Engineering Services

Xinhua News Agency Report: As of December 15, Jilin Province has successively built 66 reservoirs, 330 ponds and dams, and dug more than 240 water wells, machine wells, and artesian springs. In terms of flood control, 3,311 flood storage areas have been completed, and about 200,000 meters of drainage ditches have been repaired. More than 1,700 large and medium-sized projects are under construction.

Jilin Province has a severely cold winter climate, with temperatures around minus 30 degrees Celsius for about three months each year, and a frost layer as deep as two meters. In addition to fighting against soil and water, water conservancy construction must also combat the severe cold. However, after summarizing the experience of large-scale winter water conservancy construction in 1957 and 1958, the start date for construction this year was generally more than a month earlier than in previous years, and the number of people participating in water conservancy construction also increased significantly compared to previous years. They utilize ice and snow for winter water conservancy services. The "knife-pulling soil cutting method" and "iron wedge prying soil method" created at the flood control construction site of Daling Commune in Huaide County have increased the efficiency of digging frozen soil by three to four times. Some construction site workers use the method of pulling to cut soil to cut frozen soil into squares for embankment construction, or use a combination of frozen soil and wet soil to build embankments, and the quality of the project is very good.

The leadership departments in various regions attach great importance to the safety and health of the workers, ensuring that all winter construction workers have cold-proof equipment such as cotton clothing, coats, hats, cotton gloves, and cotton shoes. According to incomplete statistics, the value of cold-proof materials supplied for winter construction in various regions is nearly 7 million yuan.

Guangdong Reforms Tools Using Local Materials

Xinhua News Agency Report: Water conservancy construction sites in Guangdong Province are self-reliant and use local materials to launch a high tide of tool reform. More than 100 types of advanced tools have been created, imitated, and improved throughout the province, and more than 800,000 pieces have been put into use. 143 key water conservancy projects have achieved mechanized earthwork construction; water conservancy construction sites in areas such as Leinan, Shunde in Fanshun County, Huiyang, Huaxian, Kaiping, and Sanshui counties have basically achieved vehicle and boat transportation, eliminating shoulder carrying of soil. The result of tool reform and technological innovation has greatly improved construction efficiency. At present, the average efficiency per person per day in the province has reached 3.7 cubic meters, more than doubling the average efficiency before late November.

The prominent problem encountered by water conservancy construction sites in Guangdong Province in tool reform is the shortage of materials. The main way for various regions to solve this problem is to rely on the masses, be self-reliant, and use local materials. Leibei County found a large number of scattered wood and scrap metal from communes, brigades, and construction sites, and made more than 2,900 vehicles and a large number of advanced tools such as earth cranes, earth excavators, inclined chutes, soil loading docks, and aerial cableways, increasing the average efficiency of the county by more than two times.

Qinghai Creates Various Advanced Tools

Xinhua News Agency Report: In the high-efficiency water conservancy competition movement centered on tool reform, various water conservancy construction sites in Qinghai Province have created and promoted a large number of advanced construction tools, which have promoted a multiple increase in labor efficiency and a continuous acceleration of construction progress. As of December 21, the province has expanded the irrigated area by more than 1.89 million mu. This number is equal to 86.89% of the total irrigated area expanded in the ten years since liberation.

In terms of excavation, Zongzhai Commune in Xining City created six advanced methods of digging soil, with the most reaching 50 to 80 cubic meters of soil excavated per worker per day. In terms of compaction, the Putai Reservoir construction site in Hanzhuang Commune, Ledu County, gathered more than 40 carpenters to research and manufacture a wood and stone rolling machine to replace manual ramming, increasing efficiency by five times. Many construction sites also erected transportation cableways in the air and laid light rails on the ground, thereby greatly improving transportation efficiency. At the Chachaxiangka Reservoir construction site in the Qaidam area, after two ice roads were built, the soil transportation efficiency was more than ten times higher than that of handcarts.

Shaanxi Reforms Tools to Adapt to Terrain

Xinhua News Agency Report: The Party organizations at water conservancy construction sites in Shaanxi mobilized the workers to vigorously carry out technological innovation activities, and the work efficiency has been significantly improved.

The 326 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects that have been started in Shaanxi Province this year are mostly located in plateaus and mountainous areas, and the construction conditions are relatively difficult. In the tool reform movement, various regions first changed the situation of carrying soil and stones on backs and shoulders and transporting them by animals in mountainous areas. At present, vehicle transportation of soil and stones has basically been realized at various water conservancy construction sites in the province. Many construction site workers have manufactured many tools suitable for complex terrain based on the characteristics of many mountains, deep gullies, and steep slopes. In Hanzhong Prefecture alone, 15 key projects have produced more than 100,000 pieces of various semi-mechanized transportation tools such as high-line transportation, earth trains, prop-lever cranes, land boats, ground crawlers, pulley carts, and turntable soil conveyors. The workers at the Wuguan Reservoir in Shangluo Prefecture reduced the size of the front wheel and increased the size of the rear wheel of the double-wheeled double-share plow, transforming it into a soil-pushing and stone-pulling vehicle, making it very convenient to climb slopes and cross rivers, increasing the transportation efficiency by fifteen times.

Jiangsu Launches High-Efficiency Competition

Xinhua News Agency Report: A high-efficiency competition centered on tool reform is being widely launched at water conservancy construction sites in Jiangsu Province. Through this competition, the daily work efficiency of water conservancy construction in the province has rapidly increased from the original 9 million cubic meters to more than 12 million cubic meters. Now, the province has completed about 30% of the water conservancy construction tasks for this winter and next spring.

In the high-efficiency competition, various regions initially focused on tool reform and made a big splash in technological innovation. Under the slogan of "hard work, practical work, and clever work," the water conservancy construction sites in Pixian County created and promoted 14 types of advanced tools such as four-wheeled flat carts, leap-forward carts, inverted pulleys, and mechanical soil conveyors, totaling more than 30,000 units (pieces), basically achieving vehicle transportation of soil, winch passivization, pulleyization, and boomization for slope climbing, with an average efficiency of more than 8 cubic meters, an increase of more than six times compared to the original. Due to vigorous technological innovation and continuous improvement of labor efficiency, Huaiyin, Huaian, Guanyun, Guannan, and other counties have completed the first phase of the Grand Canal construction project ahead of schedule. Tool repair factories or mobile repair teams have been generally established at various water conservancy construction sites to assist workers in reforming tools. (Attached picture)

　　改革治水工具　工效高质量好
    贵州完成五万多处工程
    据新华社讯　贵州山区群众性的水利建设运动已取得巨大成就。经过两个月的苦干巧干，到12月20日止，已完成各项大小水利工程五万二千多处，扩大灌溉面积一百六十万亩。
    在今年的大兴水利中，普遍开展了以技术革新为中心的高工效运动。全省目前土石方的平均工效，已由开始时每人每天一立方米提高到三点五立方米。长顺县在全县三百二十九处水利工地上开展“比质量、比工效、比安全”的挂钩赛和连环赛，涌现出水利建设标兵一千三百多人，成为贵州省水利高工效的红旗。这个县的塘坝水库工地，每人每天挖土石方的平均工效已达到十一点四立方米。
    吉林利用冰雪为工程服务
    据新华社讯　吉林省截至12月15日，已先后建成水库六十六座，塘坝三百三十座，打水井、机井和挖自流泉二百四十多个。治涝方面，已完成蓄洪区三千三百一十一处，修排水沟约二十万米。正在施工的还有大中型工程一千七百多处。
    吉林省冬季气候严寒，每年有三个月左右的气温在摄氏零下三十度左右，冻层深达两米。水利建设除向水土斗争外，还必须同严寒搏斗。但是，经过总结1957年和1958年大规模冬修水利的经验，今年动工期普遍比往年提前一个多月，参加水利建设的人数也比往年增加很多，他们利用冰雪为冬修水利服务。怀德县大岭公社治涝工地创造的“拉刀切土法”、“铁楔撬土法”等先进方法，使刨冻土效率提高三至四倍多。有的工地民工用拉力切土的办法，把冻土切成方块来砌堤，或用冻土湿土搭配筑堤，工程质量都很好。
    各地领导部门，十分重视民工们的安全和健康，保证了所有冬修民工都有棉服、大衣、帽子、棉手套和棉鞋等防寒装备，据不完全统计，各地供应冬修的防寒物资价值近七百万元。
    广东就地取材改革工具
    据新华社讯　广东省各地水利工地自力更生，就地取材，掀起了工具改革高潮。全省创造、仿制和改良的先进工具已有一百多种，已推广使用八十多万件。有一百四十三宗重点水利工程已经实现土机械化施工；雷南、番顺县顺德地区、惠阳、花县、开平、三水等县的水利工地已基本实现车船运输，消灭了肩挑运土。工具改革和技术革新的结果，大大提高了施工效率。目前，全省每人每日平均工效已达三点七立方米，比11月下旬以前的平均工效提高一倍多。
    广东省各水利工地在工具改革中，遇到的突出问题是材料不足。各地解决这个问题的办法，主要是依靠群众，自力更生，就地取材。雷北县从公社、大队和工地上找到了大批零星木材和五金废料，制成了车子二千九百多部和大批土起重机、土挖泥机、斜坡滑槽、装土码头、空中索道等先进工具，使全县平均工效提高了两倍多。
    青海创制多种先进工具
    据新华社讯　青海省各个水利工地在以工具改革为中心的水利高工效竞赛运动中，创制和推广了大量的先进施工工具，促使劳动效率成倍提高，施工进度不断加快。截至12月21日，全省已经扩大灌溉面积一百八十九万多亩。这个数字等于解放以后十年来扩大灌溉面积总和的86.89％。
    在开挖方面，西宁市总寨公社创造了六种先进的挖土方法，每个劳力每天挖土最多的达到五十到八十立方米。在夯实方面，乐都县汉庄公社蒲台水库工地集中四十多名木匠，研究制造了一种木石碾压机代替人力打夯，工效提高五倍。许多工地还在空中架设了运输索道，地上铺设了轻便轨道，从而使运输效率大大提高。柴达木地区查查香卡水库工地在修了两条冰道之后，运土效率就比手推车运土提高了十倍多。
    陕西适应地形改革工具
    据新华社讯　陕西各地水利工地党组织，发动民工大搞技术革新活动，工效显著提高。
    陕西省今年已经动工修建的三百二十六处大、中型水利工程，大都在高原和山区，施工条件比较困难。各地在工具改革运动中，首先改变了山区用人背肩挑和牲口驮运土、石的情况。目前，全省各水利工地上已基本实现运土、运石车子化。许多工地民工根据山多沟深坡陡的特点，制造了许多适合复杂地形使用的工具。仅汉中一个专区的十五处重点工程，就制造出高线运输、土火车、撑杠吊、旱船、地爬车、滑轮车、转盘运土机等各种半机械化运输工具十万余件。商雒专区武关水库的民工，把双轮双铧犁的前轮改小，后轮改大，改装成推土拉石车，爬坡过河很方便，使运输工效提高了十五倍。
    江苏开展高工效竞赛
    据新华社讯　以工具改革为中心的高工效竞赛，正在江苏省各水利工地广泛展开。通过这一竞赛，全省兴修水利的日工效已由原来的九百万立方米，迅速增加到一千二百多万立方米。现在，全省已完成今冬明春水利建设任务的30％左右。
    在高工效竞赛中，各地一开始就以工具改革为中心，大闹技术革新。邳县各水利工地在“苦干、实干、加巧干”的口号下，共制造和推广了四轮平车、跃进小车、倒滑轮和机械运土机等十四种先进工具，共三万多部（件），基本上实现了运土车子化，爬坡绞关化、滑轮化、吊杆化，平均工效达到八立方米以上，比原来提高了六倍。淮阴、淮安、灌云、灌南等县由于大搞技术革新，不断提高劳动效率，已提前完成兴修大运河的第一期工程任务。各水利工地普遍建立了工具修配厂或流动修理组，协助民工改革工具。（附图片）
