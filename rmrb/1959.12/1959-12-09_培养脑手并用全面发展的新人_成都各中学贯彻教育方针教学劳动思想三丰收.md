    Cultivating New People with All-Round Development of Brain and Hand
    Chengdu Middle Schools Implement the Educational Policy with a Triple Harvest of Teaching, Labor, and Thought

    (Our report) Chengdu's ordinary middle schools have resolutely implemented the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, focusing on ideology, productive labor, and teaching, resulting in a comprehensive harvest in teaching, labor, and political thought.

    Since 1958, a thriving scene has emerged in all ordinary middle schools in Chengdu. More than forty middle schools in the city have all established factories, farms, and other productive labor bases, properly arranging teaching and productive labor, fundamentally changing the tendency of education being divorced from politics and reality for many years. According to the results of two unified examinations in language and mathematics in ordinary middle schools throughout the city this year, the quality of education in various schools has improved significantly. However, due to the long-term influence of bourgeois education on many teachers, various ambiguous understandings and erroneous views on the Party's educational policy have been exposed among teachers in some schools since the beginning of this semester.

    In response to this situation, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, ordinary middle schools throughout the city have focused on political and ideological work, centered on further implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, organizing teachers and students to deeply study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and criticizing various erroneous ideological understandings. Education administrative departments in various districts have successively selected key schools, held on-site meetings, organized teaching demonstrations, introduced the experience of these schools in combining education with productive labor, and led school administrative cadres and teachers to conduct discussions on the issue of implementing the Party's educational policy. During the study, many schools, such as the Sixteenth Middle School and the Twenty-first Middle School, raised questions such as whether education should be combined with productive labor, whether it could be combined, how it should be combined, and how to understand the establishment of normal teaching order, organizing discussions and debates. Through debates, everyone unanimously realized that socialist school education must not take the old path of being divorced from politics and productive labor. Only by strengthening basic knowledge education while closely combining education with productive labor can the goal of improving teaching quality be achieved. The many vivid facts in the educational revolution over the past year are evidence of this. Subsequently, ordinary middle schools throughout the city immediately focused on productive labor to promote a comprehensive leap forward in all aspects of school teaching, productive labor, and other work.

    In focusing on productive labor, middle schools in Chengdu generally formulate development plans for school-run factories and farms based on the number of classes, the number of students, the number of guiding teachers, and teaching needs. On the one hand, they consolidate and improve the original more than 140 production bases. On the other hand, they adopt methods of making use of simple and crude equipment, relying on their own efforts, and cooperating with factories and enterprises to solve the difficulties of lacking equipment and raw materials, and gradually establish new production bases. Subsequently, various schools properly arranged teaching and productive labor time; and incorporated productive labor into the education plan, combining it with manual labor, basic agricultural knowledge, and industrial internship courses according to different grades. Schools such as the Twenty-third Middle School have also formulated relatively long-term systematic productive labor plans, arranging the production skills that students should master during the three years in a step-by-step manner. In addition, various schools have generally established various productive labor management systems. Schools such as the Sixteenth Middle School have assigned school-run factories, farms, and other bases to teaching and research groups closely related to physics, mathematics, chemistry, etc., according to their nature, in order to better arrange teaching and productive labor.

    In focusing on the combination of teaching and productive labor, ordinary middle schools in Chengdu have paid special attention to using many experiences since the educational revolution, giving full play to the due role of production bases in realizing the combination of teaching and productive labor, and improving teaching content and teaching methods.

    Now, a new scene of teachers preparing lessons carefully, students studying hard, teachers and students working together, and great improvement in political thought has generally emerged in ordinary middle schools in Chengdu. In October, the output value of factories run by various middle schools increased exponentially, production efficiency continued to improve, and the full-month production plans were generally completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. At the same time, due to the vigorous development of agricultural labor, a number of middle schools in the city have also achieved basic self-sufficiency in vegetables, and a large number of skilled workers who have mastered production technology have emerged. Teachers and students are highly enthusiastic about labor, the school learning order is very good, and the quality of education has improved significantly. (Zhou Zuyou)

    培养脑手并用全面发展的新人
    成都各中学贯彻教育方针教学劳动思想三丰收
    本报讯　成都市普通中学坚持贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，抓思想，抓生产劳动，抓教学，使教学、劳动和政治思想三方面普告丰收。
    1958年以来，成都各普通中学普遍出现了欣欣向荣的局面。全市四十多所中学全部建立起了工厂、农场等生产劳动基地，妥善安排了教学和生产劳动，从根本上改变了多少年来教育脱离政治、脱离实际的倾向。根据今年全市普通中学语文、数学两科两次统一考试的成绩来看，各学校教育质量都有了显著的提高。但是，由于许多教师长期以来受资产阶级教育影响，本学期开始以后，在一些学校教师中，又暴露出形形色色对党的教育方针的模糊认识和错误观点。
    针对这种情况，在各级党组织领导下，全市普通中学大抓政治思想工作，以进一步贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针为中心，组织学校师生深入学习党的八届八中全会文件，批判各种错误思想认识。各区教育行政部门相继选择重点学校，召开现场会议，组织观摩教学，介绍这些学校教育与生产劳动相结合的经验，领导学校行政干部和教师就贯彻党的教育方针问题进行讨论。在学习中，第十六中、二十一中等许多学校提出教育与生产劳动要不要结合、能不能结合、以及应该如何结合，怎样理解建立正常教学秩序等问题，组织鸣放、辩论。通过辩论，大家一致认识到，社会主义学校教育决不能走脱离政治、脱离生产劳动的老路，只有在加强基础知识教育的同时，把教育与生产劳动紧密结合起来，才能达到提高教学质量的目的，一年以来教育革命中许多生动事实就是明证。随后，全市各普通中学立即大抓生产劳动，以促进学校教学、生产劳动等各方面工作的全面跃进。
    成都市各中学在大抓生产劳动中，一般都按照校内班次、学生人数、指导教师数量和教学需要，拟订出校办工厂、农场的发展计划。他们一方面巩固健全原有一百四十多个生产基地，一方面采取因陋就简、自力更生，与工厂、企业协作的办法，解决设备和原材料缺乏的困难，把新的生产基地逐步建立起来。接着，各学校妥善安排了教学和生产劳动时间；并把生产劳动纳入教育计划中，按不同年级，分别与手工劳动、农业基础知识和工业实习三门课结合起来。第二十三中学等学校还制订了比较长期的系统的生产劳动计划，把学生在三年期间所应该掌握的生产技能，有步骤地安排。此外，各学校还普遍建立了各种生产劳动管理制度。第十六中学等学校则把校办工厂、农场等基地，按性质分别交给物理、数学、化学等联系密切的教研组负责，以便更好地安排教学和生产劳动。
    在大抓教学与生产劳动的结合方面，成都市各普通中学都特别注意运用教育革命以来的许多经验，充分发挥生产基地在实现教学与生产劳动结合中的应有作用，改进教学内容和教学方法。
    现在，成都市各普通中学已经普遍出现教师认真备课、学生努力学习、师生共同劳动、政治思想大提高的崭新景象。10月份，各中学校办工厂产值成倍地增长，生产效率不断提高，普遍提前超额完成了全月生产计划。同时，由于农业劳动蓬勃开展，全市还有一批中学作到蔬菜基本自给，并出现了大批掌握生产技术的能手。师生们劳动热情高涨，学校学习秩序非常良好，教育质量显著提高。　（周祖佑）
