Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 10th: The CCP Central Committee convened the Second National Meeting on Non-Staple Food Production in Large and Medium Cities in Chongqing from November 15th to 21st. The meeting affirmed the great achievements in the production and supply of non-staple foods in large and medium cities since the beginning of this year, especially the basic self-sufficiency achieved in vegetables. It called on all large and medium cities to consolidate, improve, and appropriately develop vegetable production while vigorously developing animal husbandry centered on pig raising, and actively developing oil crops, aquatic products, fruits, and other non-staple food production according to local conditions, and vigorously develop diversified operations.

The meeting was presided over by Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council. Participants included heads of relevant departments of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, secretaries of municipal party committees and heads of relevant departments from 39 large and medium cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, and secretaries of the CCP Sichuan Provincial Committee and heads of relevant departments of Sichuan Province, totaling 212 people.

Representatives from Chongqing and Shanghai comprehensively introduced their experiences in developing non-staple food production, and exchanged experiences from other cities in developing the production of vegetables, pigs, poultry, aquatic products, fruits, etc. The representatives also conducted on-site visits in Chongqing, praised Chongqing's experience in developing non-staple food production, especially pig raising, and expressed their intention to actively learn from it. During the meeting, Comrade Li Dazhang, Secretary of the CCP Sichuan Provincial Committee, made a report. Comrade Li Xiannian delivered a concluding speech.

The meeting held that the production of non-staple foods in large and medium cities across the country has achieved great victories in the past year, and vegetable production has basically achieved self-sufficiency. According to statistics from the 39 large and medium cities whose representatives attended the meeting, the vegetable area reached 11.4 million mu. In the face of severe natural disasters in many regions, vegetable production increased from 23 billion jin in 1958 to 47 billion jin, an increase of 104%. The tense situation of vegetable supply that once appeared in some areas has been greatly changed. Generally, people in each city can eat one to one and a half jin of vegetables per day. Some cities can eat two jin of vegetables per day. Large cities in our country such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin have achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables, and the market has sufficient quantities and relatively fresh quality. Due to the relatively cold climate and high concentration of industry in the Northeast region, the supply of vegetables in many cities has historically relied on transportation from the South to a considerable extent. This year, these cities also achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables, fundamentally changing the historical situation of transporting vegetables from the South to the North. Cities such as Harbin have also transported some vegetables to support other regions. In the past year, the number of livestock and poultry in various cities has increased significantly. The number of pigs in stock in 39 cities increased from 12.11 million at the end of 1958 to 17.08 million at the end of October 1959, an increase of 41%; poultry increased from 41.49 million at the end of 1958 to 95.74 million at the end of October 1959, an increase of 130%. The meat supply situation in most cities has improved. Cities such as Chongqing and Changsha have developed livestock and poultry rapidly, and have achieved basic self-sufficiency in meat based on the existing lower supply levels. The production of aquatic products, oil crops, fruits, and other non-staple foods has also developed to varying degrees. The non-staple food production bases in the suburbs of large and medium cities have been initially formed. The above achievements powerfully prove that the central government's policy of "self-reliance as the main principle, striving for external assistance as a supplement" for the production of non-staple foods in large and medium cities is completely correct and achievable.

The meeting held that the production of non-staple foods in the future should still "emphasize both urban and rural areas." The production of non-staple foods in large and medium cities should continue to implement the policy of "self-reliance as the main principle, striving for external assistance as a supplement," and industrial and mining areas and forestry areas should also implement this policy. This policy is not a short-term policy, but a long-term policy.

The meeting emphasized: Vigorously developing animal husbandry centered on pig raising is the most important task in the production of non-staple foods in large and medium cities at present. From now on, we should vigorously engage in animal husbandry, and vigorously develop pig, cattle, sheep, donkey, horse, mule, chicken, duck, goose, rabbit, and bee farming. Taking pig raising as the center of animal husbandry refers to the vast majority of regions in the country. In areas where conditions permit the large-scale development of cattle and sheep, such as the Inner Mongolia region, cattle and sheep should also be vigorously developed while developing pig raising. As for ethnic minority areas that prohibit pigs, the development of animal husbandry should be centered on cattle and sheep.

The meeting emphasized that animal husbandry production should implement the policy of combining public and private raising, with public raising as the main and private raising as the supplement. In terms of public raising, first, we should accelerate the development of state-owned breeding farms and gradually establish strong state-owned breeding bases. Second, we should vigorously develop collectively-owned breeding farms, which are the main force in developing animal husbandry in the current period. Among the collectively-owned breeding farms, we should focus on developing breeding farms at the commune and production team levels, and at the same time develop breeding farms in production brigades and rural public canteens. Third, self-sufficient breeding farms in government agencies, organizations, schools, factories, mines, troops, and urban residential canteens should also be actively developed. In addition to mainly developing the above three aspects of public raising, appropriate support should be given to the individual breeding of members under the principle of not hindering collective labor, and encouragement should be given to chicken raising. In the development of animal husbandry production, we should adopt "poor methods," rely on our own efforts, and overcome difficulties. In terms of seed sources, we should implement the method of self-breeding and self-raising. In a short period of time, female livestock and poultry should generally not be castrated or killed, eat less meat, and reproduce more. In terms of feed, we should focus on coarse feed, feed coarse feed with concentrate, and concentrate can only be matched with a necessary small portion. We must extensively use various crop stalks and vines, collect all wild grasses and leaves that can be used as feed, and make full use of by-products from grain and oil processing and all other usable feed. We must establish feed bases according to necessity and possibility, and advocate planting high-yielding feed crops such as corn and sweet potatoes. Pig sheds, chicken coops, and other equipment should also be simple and use local materials, relying on the masses to solve them.

The meeting held that emphasizing the development of animal husbandry does not mean that the production of vegetables can be ignored in the slightest. In cities where the quantity of vegetables already meets the needs, efforts should be made to improve quality and increase varieties. We must achieve year-round supply, strive for fresh quality, and gradually and appropriately increase the proportion of fine vegetables. We must further improve processing, storage, and supply, and combine vegetable cultivation with the development of animal husbandry. We must vigorously carry out the basic construction of vegetable fields, gradually realize semi-mechanization and mechanization of production, and greatly increase the output per unit area.

The meeting held that edible oil occupies a very important position in non-staple foods, and all large and medium cities should actively develop oil production. We must strive to increase the yield per unit area of existing oil crops, and mobilize the masses to make full use of all available land to plant various oil crops. We must not only grasp herbaceous oil crops, but also woody oil crops; we must not only grasp the immediate, but also the long-term; we must not only grasp the domestic, but also the wild, so that oil production can be greatly developed.

The meeting also pointed out that all places with water surfaces should make full use of them to develop aquatic products. We must continue to implement the policy of attaching equal importance to aquaculture and fishing; we must vigorously solve the problems of motorized sailboats and fishing gear. In addition, the production of various fruits should be planned as early as possible and the planting area should be expanded.

The meeting emphasized that to achieve the various tasks in non-staple food production, the key lies in further strengthening the leadership of the Party, vigorously launching mass movements, and continuing to exert revolutionary vigor. Developing animal husbandry is a more arduous and complex task than developing vegetables, and we must have the ambition to overcome difficulties, give full play to soaring revolutionary vigor, overcome right-leaning fear of difficulties, and oppose the cowardly and lazy thinking of some people who say "this is impossible and that cannot be done." In the production of non-staple foods, we must not only organize professional teams, but also mobilize everyone to take action, and launch a vigorous and solid mass movement. In the mass movement for the production of non-staple foods, we must vigorously carry out technological innovation, improve labor productivity, and mobilize the masses to work hard, practically, and cleverly, and encourage everyone to use their brains, improve tools, create inventions, and try every possible means to save labor. Urban industrial departments and scientific research institutions should closely cooperate, actively support, and strive for the mechanization of suburban agriculture, animal husbandry, and aquatic industry to take the lead over general rural areas where conditions permit. The meeting also pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen cooperation in all aspects under the unified leadership of the Party committee, especially to strengthen agricultural and commercial cooperation. Financial and trade departments should care about production, participate in the planning and organization of production, and actively promote the development of production. Agricultural departments should care about the market and care about supply. We must seize the processing, transportation, and storage of agricultural products and non-staple foods. At present, processing, transportation, and storage cannot adapt to the needs of the large-scale development of agricultural products and non-staple foods, and the vast urban and rural masses should be mobilized to actively participate in processing, transportation, and storage; we should consolidate and develop the processing industries run by people's communes and urban streets; we should vigorously carry out technological innovation in processing, storage, and transportation, gradually increase mechanical equipment, improve labor productivity, and strive to increase the yield rate of finished products and reduce losses in transportation and storage.

The meeting finally emphasized that the central government's general policy on non-staple food production is to emphasize both urban and rural areas. While developing non-staple food production in cities, the vast rural areas should also vigorously develop non-staple food production, vigorously develop animal husbandry, and actively support cities. It must be recognized that it is extremely important for the vast rural areas to implement both self-sufficient production and commodity production, actively increase various non-staple foods while increasing the production of grain, cotton, and other crops, and carry out diversified operations. The meeting called on Party committees at all levels to further strengthen the organization and leadership of non-staple food production and diversified operations in rural areas.

    中共中央召开第二次副食品生产会议确定当前任务
    以养猪为中心大力发展畜牧业
    提高和发展蔬菜生产，因地制宜开展油料、水产、果品等多种经营
    继续执行城乡并举，自力更生为主、力争外援为辅的方针
    新华社重庆10日电　中共中央于11月15日至21日在重庆市召开了第二次全国大、中城市副食品生产会议。会议肯定了今年以来大中城市副食品的生产和供应特别是蔬菜实现基本自给的伟大成绩，要求各大、中城市在巩固、提高和适当发展蔬菜生产的同时，大力发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产，并且因地制宜地积极地发展油料、水产、果品和其他副食品生产，大力发展多种经营。
    会议由中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念主持。参加会议的有中共中央、国务院有关部门的负责人，北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州等三十九个大中城市的市委书记和有关部门的负责人，中共四川省委书记和四川省有关部门的负责人，共计二百一十二人。
    会议由重庆市和上海市的代表全面介绍了发展副食品生产的经验，交流了其他各城市发展蔬菜、生猪、家禽、水产、水果等生产的经验。代表们还在重庆进行了现场参观，对重庆市发展副食品生产特别是发展生猪的经验加以赞扬，表示要积极学习。会议期间，中共四川省委书记李大章同志作了报告。李先念同志最后作了总结发言。
    会议认为，一年来全国各大中城市的副食品生产取得了伟大的胜利，蔬菜生产已经基本自给，据有代表参加会议的三十九个大中城市统计，蔬菜面积达到一千一百四十万亩，在许多地区遭受严重自然灾害的情况下，蔬菜产量从1958年的二百三十亿斤增加到四百七十亿斤，增长104％。某些地区曾经一度出现的蔬菜供应紧张情况已经大为改变，一般城市每人每天可吃到一斤到一斤半菜。有的城市每人每天可以吃到两斤菜。我国的大城市如上海、北京、天津等已经实现了蔬菜自给，市场蔬菜数量充足，质量也比较新鲜。东北地区由于气候比较寒冷，工业又很集中，许多城市蔬菜的供应，历来有相当大的部分要从南方调运，今年这些城市也做到了蔬菜自给，根本改变了历史上南菜北运的局面。哈尔滨等城市还运出了一部分蔬菜支援其他地区。一年来各个城市家畜家禽的数量有了显著增长，三十九个城市生猪存栏头数从1958年年末的一千二百一十一万头增加到1959年10月底的一千七百零八万头，增长了41％；家禽从1958年末的四千一百四十九万只增加到1959年10月末的九千五百七十四万只，增长了130％。多数城市的肉食供应情况有所改进，重庆、长沙等城市家畜家禽发展很快，按照现有的较低的供应水平已经实现了肉食的基本自给。水产、油料、果品和其他副食品生产也有不同程度的发展，大、中城市郊区的副食品生产基地已经初步形成。以上这些成绩，有力地证明了中央提出的大中城市副食品生产“自力更生为主、力争外援为辅”的方针是完全正确的，是能够实现的。
    会议认为，今后副食品的生产，仍然应当“城乡并举”。大中城市的副食品生产应当继续贯彻执行“自力更生为主、力争外援为辅”的方针，工矿区和林业区也应当执行这个方针。这个方针不是短期的方针，而是一个长远的方针。
    会议着重指出：大力发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产，是当前大中城市副食品生产中最重要的任务。从现在开始，应当大搞畜牧业，大力发展养猪、养牛、养羊、养驴、养马、养骡、养鸡、养鸭、养鹅、养兔、养蜂等项事业。以养猪为畜牧业的中心，是指全国绝大多数地区说的。在有条件大量发展牛羊的地方，例如内蒙古地区，在发展养猪的同时，也应当大力发展牛、羊。至于禁猪的少数民族地区，畜牧业的发展应当以牛羊为中心。
    会议强调指出，畜牧业生产应当实行公养私养并举，以公养为主私养为辅的政策。在公养方面，第一，应当加快发展国营饲养场，逐步建立强大的国营饲养基地。第二，大力发展集体所有制的饲养场，这是当前时期发展畜牧业的主要力量。在集体所有制的饲养场中，应当着重发展公社一级的和生产队的饲养场，同时发展生产小队的和农村公共食堂的饲养场。第三，机关、团体、学校、厂矿、部队和城市居民食堂的自给性饲养场，也要积极发展。除了主要发展以上三个方面的公养以外，对社员个人饲养业，应当在不妨碍集体劳动的原则下，适当给以支持，在养鸡方面还应当加以鼓励。在发展畜牧业的生产中，应当采取“穷办法”，自力更生，克服困难。在种源方面应当实行自繁自养的办法，在一个短时期内，对母畜母禽应当一般不阉不杀，少吃肉，多繁殖。在饲料方面，要以粗饲料为主，粗料精喂，精料只能搭配必要的一小部分。要广泛利用各种作物的秸秆藤蔓，采集一切可以作饲料的野草树叶，充分利用粮食油料加工后的副产品以及其他一切可以利用的饲料。要根据必要和可能建立饲料基地，提倡种玉米、红薯等高产饲料作物。猪棚鸡舍和其他设备也要因陋就简，就地取材，依靠群众加以解决。
    会议认为，强调发展畜牧业，并不是说可以丝毫忽视蔬菜的生产。在蔬菜数量已经满足需要的城市，应当努力提高质量，增加品种。要做到全年应市，力求质量新鲜，要逐步地适当地提高细菜的比重。要进一步作好加工、储藏和供应工作，并且把种菜和发展畜牧业结合起来。要大力进行菜田的基本建设，逐步实现生产半机械化和机械化，大大提高单位面积产量。
    会议认为，食油在副食品中占有很重要的地位，各大中城市应当积极发展油料生产。要努力提高现有油料作物的单位面积产量，要发动群众尽量利用一切可以利用的土地，种植各种油料作物。既要抓草本油料，又要抓木本油料，既要抓眼前的，又要抓长远的，既要抓家生的，又要抓野生的，使油料生产大量发展起来。
    会议还指出：凡是有水面的地方，都应充分利用，发展水产。要继续贯彻执行养殖和捕捞并重的方针；要大力解决机帆船和捕鱼工具问题。此外，对各种水果的生产应当及早规划，扩大种植。
    会议强调指出，要实现副食品生产上的各项任务，关键在于进一步加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，继续鼓足革命干劲。发展畜牧业比发展蔬菜任务更为艰巨，更为复杂，必须有克服困难的雄心壮志，发挥冲天的革命干劲，克服右倾畏难情绪，反对有些人的“这也不可能，那也办不到”的懦夫和懒汉的思想。在副食品生产中，既要组织专业队伍，又要发动大家动手，要开展一个轰轰烈烈而又扎扎实实的群众运动。在副食品生产的群众运动中，要大搞技术革新，提高劳动生产率，要发动群众苦干、实干、巧干，鼓励大家开动脑筋、改良工具，创造发明，千方百计地节约劳动力。城市工业部门和科学研究机关应当密切配合，积极支援，在可能条件下，力求郊区农业、畜牧业、水产业的机械化比一般农村先走一步。会议还指出，要在党委统一领导下加强各方面的协作，特别是要加强农商协作。财贸部门应当关心生产，参与生产的规划和组织，积极促进生产的发展。农业部门应当关心市场，关心供应。必须抓紧农产品和副食品的加工、运输和保管工作。目前加工、运输、保管还不能适应农产品和副食品大量发展的需要，应当发动城乡广大群众积极参与加工、运输和保管工作；应当巩固和发展人民公社和城市街道举办的加工工业；应当在加工、保管和运输方面大搞技术革新，逐步增加机械设备，提高劳动生产率，并努力提高成品率，减少运输和保管中的损耗。
    会议最后强调指出，中央关于副食品生产的总方针是城乡并举，在城市发展副食品生产的同时，广大农村也要大力发展副食品生产，大力发展畜牧业，积极支援城市。必须认识，广大农村实行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举，在增产粮食、棉花等农作物的同时，积极增加各种副食品，开展多种经营，具有极为重要的意义。会议要求各地党委进一步加强对于农村副食品生产和多种经营的组织领导。
