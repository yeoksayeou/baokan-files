    Zhejiang Mass Produces Light Rails Shanxi Makes Small Locomotive
    (Our Dispatch) The first batch of eight-kilogram light rails in Zhejiang Province has recently been successfully rolled out by the small rolling mill workshop of the Banshan Iron and Steel Plant in Zhejiang Province. The quality is fully qualified and meets the first-class product standards. Now the plant has begun mass production of light rails to support industrial and mining enterprises, transportation and other departments in building local railways and light railways.
    The small rolling mill workshop of the Banshan Iron and Steel Plant has produced several products in succession in less than three months since it was put into production. When they received the new product task of rolling light rails, the workers were all overjoyed, gave full play to their energy, and engaged in vigorous technical innovation. For example, in order to reduce the rotation speed of the rolling mill, they created a "water resistance automatic speed reducer," which solved the key problem of the rolling mill.
    At first, some cadres believed that only large steel plants could roll light rails, and some said that "a 300 rolling mill is simply impossible to roll light rails"; but the workers, under the leadership and support of the Party, dared to think and dared to do, and finally successfully rolled out the light rails, and produced them very well.
    (Our Dispatch) The workers of the Shanxi Automobile Manufacturing Plant recently manufactured three diesel locomotives suitable for short-distance transportation in industrial and mining enterprises. Its driving speed is 30 kilometers per hour, the towing weight is 100 to 200 tons, and the braking is very safe and reliable. It has now been decided to produce this type of locomotive in large quantities next year.
    This locomotive adopts the Zhan Tianyou-style hook and can tow various large freight cars on standard railways. Its engine is a modified version of the "Forward" brand 80-horsepower diesel engine that is being mass-produced by the plant.

    浙江成批生产轻轨  山西制成小火车头
    本报讯　浙江省第一批八公斤轻轨，最近由浙江省半山钢铁厂小型轧钢车间胜利轧成，质量全部合格，达到一级品标准。现在这个厂已经开始大批生产轻轨，支援工矿企业、交通运输等部门建筑土铁路和轻便铁路。
    半山钢铁厂小型轧钢车间投入生产不到三个月，就先后生产了好几种产品。当他们接到轧制轻轨的新产品任务后，职工们个个欢欣鼓舞，大鼓干劲，大闹技术革新。例如为了减少轧机的转动速度，他们创造了“水阻自动减速器”解决了轧机的关键问题。
    开始，有的干部认为轧制轻轨只有大的钢厂才行，有人说“300轧机根本不可能轧出轻轨”；但是职工们在党的领导和支持下，敢想敢做，终于胜利地轧出了轻轨，而且生产得很好。
    本报讯　山西汽车制造厂职工，最近制成三台适于工矿企业短途运输的柴油内燃机机车。它的行驶速度每小时三十公里，拖运重量一百吨至二百吨，而且刹车非常安全可靠。现已决定在明年大批生产这种机车。
    这种机车由于采用了詹天佑式的挂钩，可在标准铁路上牵挂各种大型车皮。它的引擎是用本厂正在成批生产的前进牌八十马力柴油发动机改装的。
