    Xinshao Iron Plant's Fenshuiling Mining Area Combines Indigenous and Foreign Technology for Technical Innovation
    Personnel Reduced by More Than Half, Output Increased Threefold
    Yong'an County Transportation Company Self-Manufactures Indigenous Machinery, Reducing Labor and Increasing Efficiency
    (By our newspaper) Hunan Province's Xinshao Iron Plant's Fenshuiling Mining Area, focusing on key aspects of production, fully mobilized the masses and, based on the principle of using foreign methods where possible and indigenous methods where foreign ones were not feasible, implemented six major innovations, from mining to transportation and loading/unloading. The labor force was reduced from 310 people in April (excluding temporary workers) to 90 people in October. The average monthly ore production increased from 80 tons to 355 tons, an increase of 343%, and also greatly saved raw materials, reduced costs, and lessened labor intensity.
    For a period of time, the pig iron production of Xinshao Iron Plant continued to grow, but the ore production and ore transportation volume remained at the original level, far from meeting the needs of production. In order to overcome this weak link, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the mining area established a technical innovation committee composed of technicians and workers, and formulated an innovation plan targeting key aspects of production, proposing six key areas: mining, pit wood supports, blasting, in-mine transportation, out-of-mine transportation, and loading. After extensive discussions among the workers, in just eight days, the workers put forward 396 innovation suggestions.
    In mining, the square-frame filling mining method was implemented, which not only expanded the mining area and ensured safety, but also increased the ore recovery rate to over 95%. The ore extraction volume increased from an average of three tons per person per shift to twelve tons. In blasting, the plum blossom deep-hole blasting method was implemented, with more than ten holes drilled at a time, capable of blasting 1.2 cubic meters, increasing efficiency by two times. In in-mine transportation, shoulder carrying was completely replaced by indigenous railway ore car transportation, reducing the labor force from 180 people to 45 people. In out-of-mine transportation, three cableways were established, operated by fifteen people, capable of transporting 483 tons of ore per day. In loading, originally five trucks required 54 people to load ore; now, five funnels were made for automatic loading, and fifteen trucks only require six people for loading. The loading time was shortened from 20 minutes to half a minute.
    (By our newspaper) Since the spring, Yong'an County Transportation Company in Fujian Province has vigorously promoted technical innovation, basically eliminating manual labor in the entire company, realizing the vehicle-ization of transportation and the indigenous mechanization of loading and unloading, achieving personnel reduction and increased production. With the number of workers reduced from more than 700 last year to 423, the annual loading and unloading plan was completed 100 days ahead of schedule.
    With the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, Yong'an County Transportation Company's loading and unloading task this year has increased nearly doubled compared to last year. At the same time, more than 200 workers returned to the countryside to support agricultural production. Under these circumstances, all the workers of the factory devoted themselves to the technical innovation movement, putting forward 117 major innovation suggestions. At the Yanjiang Ferry in the suburbs of Yong'an City, 400 tons of limestone had to be loaded from trucks onto flatbed carts at the West Ferry every day, passing through a 200-meter-long cartway, and then loaded and unloaded onto barges for crossing. The workers used their brains and, based on the terrain characteristics of the West Ferry, utilized a natural slope and dug a sloping chute from high to low, paving the chute with bamboo strips to realize chute-ized loading and unloading. The trucks carrying limestone directly unloaded the limestone into the chute, allowing the limestone to slide down the chute and flow directly into the barges by the river. In this way, the number of loading and unloading workers was reduced from 40 to 6, and the original 12 flatbed carts could be dispensed with entirely, increasing work efficiency by more than eight times. For loading and unloading timber, originally it was carried manually, which was both cumbersome and dangerous. Later, they created the water-spraying log-rolling method: the truck drove onto the timber pile, and water was sprayed on the timber pile to increase lubrication. Then, using a hook to pull from above, each log directly slid and rolled into the truck bed, eliminating manual carrying. The time for loading one truck of timber was shortened from the original 12 minutes to 3 minutes.

    新邵铁厂分水坳矿区土洋结合革新技术
    人员减大半　产量增三倍
    永安县搬运公司自制土机械人力减少工效提高
    本报讯　湖南省新邵铁厂分水坳矿区，针对生产关键，充分发动群众，根据能洋则洋，不能洋则土的原则，从采矿到运输装卸，实行了六大革新，劳动力由4月份的三百一十人（不包括临时工人），10月份减少到九十人；矿石生产平均月产量却由八十吨提高到三百五十五吨，提高了343％，并大大节省了原材料，降低了成本，减轻了劳动强度。
    前一段时间，新邵铁厂生铁产量不断增长，矿石产量和矿石运输量却一直停留在原有的水平上，远远不能满足生产的需要。为了克服薄弱环节，在党委会的领导下，矿区成立了由技术员和工人参加的技术革新委员会，并针对生产关键制订了革新规划，提出了采矿、坑木支柱、爆破、井内运输、井外运输、装车等六大关键，在职工中进行广泛讨论，只八天时间，工人就提出了三百九十六条革新建议。
    在采矿方面，实行了方框充填采矿法，不但扩大了开采面积和确保了安全，而且矿回收率提高到95％以上，矿石开采量，由每班每人平均开采三吨提高到十二吨。在爆破方面，实行了梅花深眼爆破法，一次打眼十个以上，可爆破一点二立方米，效率提高了两倍。在井内运输方面，把肩挑全部改用土铁路矿车运输，劳动力由一百八十人减少到四十五人。在井外运输方面，建立了三条索道，十五个人操作，每天可运矿石四百八十三吨。在装车方面，原来五部汽车要五十四人装矿石；现在做了五个漏斗自动装车，十五部汽车只要六个人搞装载。装车时间由二十分钟缩短到半分钟。
    本报讯　福建省永安县搬运公司今春以来大搞技术革新，在全公司内基本上消灭了手工劳动，实现了运输车子化、装卸土机械化，做到了减人增产。在工人人数从去年的七百多人减少到四百二十三人的情况下，提前一百天完成了全年装卸计划。
    随着工农业生产的跃进，永安县搬运公司今年的装卸搬运任务比去年增长近一倍。同时有二百多工人回到农村支援农业生产。在这种情况下，全厂工人都投入了技术革新运动，提出了一百十七项重大革新建议。在永安城郊燕江渡口上，每天要从西渡口，把四百吨石灰石从汽车装上板车，通过一条二百米长的大车道，然后再装卸到驳船过渡。工人们开动脑筋，根据西渡口的地势特点，利用土斜坡，挖了一条从高到低的斜滑槽，在滑槽中铺上毛竹片，实现装卸滑槽化。装石灰石的汽车，直接把石灰石卸在滑槽，使石灰石顺槽滑下，直泻到江边的驳船里。这样，装卸工人便从四十人减少到六人，原来十二辆板车全部可以不用，工效提高八倍以上。装卸木材，原来是用人工扛，既笨重又危险，后来他们创造了泼水滚木法：汽车开进木材堆上，在木材堆上泼上水，增加了滑润，然后用卡钩从高一拉，一根根木材就直接滑滚到汽车车厢里，免除了人工抬运。每装一辆汽车木材从原来的十二分钟，缩短到三分钟。
