U.S. Capital Intensifies Penetration into South Vietnam

Saigon News: The United States is demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities provide more conveniences to allow more American capital to penetrate South Vietnam. According to the Saigon "Vietnam Times," U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Henry Kearns recently told the South Vietnamese press that "Americans only invest in countries that provide good working conditions." He also said that South Vietnam should assure foreign investors that they would be allowed to remit a portion of their profits back home. He demanded that, in order to "attract" American investment to South Vietnam, South Vietnam should agree that its income taxes should not exceed the tax rates stipulated by the U.S. government. According to South Vietnamese newspapers, South Vietnamese enterprises are worried about the competition from foreign capital and demand that the Ngo Dinh Diem group restrict foreign investment. Ngo Dinh Diem's newspaper, "National Revolution," also admitted that local enterprises "are unable to solve the difficulties of competing with foreign capital."

    美国资本加紧渗入南越
    西贡消息　美国要求南越当局提供更多的方便以便让更多的美国资本渗入南越。据西贡“越南时报”报道，美国助理商务部长亨利·基恩斯最近对南越报界扬言，“美国人只向提供良好的工作条件的国家投资”。他又说，南越要向外国投资者保证，准许他们把利润的一部分汇回国。他要求，为了“吸引”美国对南越的投资，南越要同意它所征收的所得税不得超过美国政府所规定的税率。据南越报纸透露，南越的企业担心外国资本的竞争并且要求吴庭艳集团限制外国投资。吴庭艳的报纸“国家革命报”也承认，本地的企业“没有能力解决和外国资本竞争的困难”。
