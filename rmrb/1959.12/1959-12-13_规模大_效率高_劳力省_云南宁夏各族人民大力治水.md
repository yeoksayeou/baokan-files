Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12th. A vigorous high tide of farmland water conservancy construction is taking shape in the rural areas of Yunnan Province. More than 100,000 small-scale and more than 500 large and medium-sized backbone water conservancy projects throughout the province have been fully started, and more than 1.2 million people of all ethnic groups are working hard to build dams and dig canals.

Since 1958, Yunnan Province has built more than 200 large and medium-sized projects and more than 400,000 small projects, forming a situation of water conservancy projects scattered like stars, which has played a great role in overcoming the serious disasters of alternating drought and flood and continuing to achieve bumper harvests. This year, Yunnan Province has summed up its experience from last year. In addition to determining the policy of focusing on small and medium-sized projects, focusing on permanent projects, and focusing on gravity irrigation based on the specific conditions of the Yunnan Plateau, it has also focused on projects that will benefit in the near future and adopted the method of building and using simultaneously, so that most projects can store water and irrigate next year. This year, Yuxi County will connect 29 large and medium-sized reservoirs and more than 80 ponds distributed in the valleys around the plains to form a relatively complete gravity irrigation network, which can irrigate 140,000 mu of farmland. The Dahe Reservoir in Jinning County has completed 73% of its construction and stored more than 2 million cubic meters of water. Now, they are striving to complete all construction by February next year, store 8 million cubic meters of water, and irrigate 15,000 mu of farmland.

This year, Yunnan Province has launched a mass movement in water conservancy construction, drawing on last year's experience of vigorously promoting tool reform to ensure high work efficiency. From the very beginning, it has achieved labor saving and high work efficiency. According to statistics from eight special districts (autonomous prefectures), including the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, more than 168,000 pieces of various water conservancy construction tools such as cattle and horse carts, handcarts, flying buckets, and rails, as well as a large number of blasting materials, were improved and manufactured before the battle, and the general dam construction efficiency has increased by more than 100% compared with last year. After the Dahe Main Canal in Jinning County realized vehicle-ization, cattle plowing-ization, and harrowing-ization, the original plan to complete the project in 162 days will be completed 98 days ahead of schedule.

According to the Ningxia Daily, a high-efficiency movement centered on technological innovation has blossomed in the water conservancy construction sites of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Two hundred thousand water conservancy heroes are determined to work hard in December, basically complete the first phase of the West Main Canal project and the mountain reservoir channels, and vigorously promote soil and water conservation and drainage and irrigation networks, so as to complete the water conservancy construction tasks for this winter and next spring ahead of schedule and above quota.

Since the start of water conservancy construction this winter, the enthusiasm of the masses has become greater and greater, the number of inventions has become more and more, and labor efficiency has become higher and higher. The average daily work efficiency of many units has exceeded five cubic meters. From October 1st to December 1st, in just two months, 16.5 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed, the irrigated area has increased by 145,000 mu, the area of soil erosion control has reached 710 square kilometers, and 25,950 new and renovated large and small ditches have been built.

In carrying out the high-efficiency movement centered on technological innovation, all construction sites adhered to putting politics in command, swept away right-leaning conservative thinking, and fully mobilized the creativity of the masses. On the West Main Canal construction site, the Huinong Detachment criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres who emphasized the difficulties of winter construction and the lack of materials. In less than ten days, they completely replaced carrying baskets with shoulder poles, and used blasting to loosen the soil, so that the average work efficiency of the entire detachment increased from 2.25 cubic meters to 5.34 cubic meters. The Qingtongxia Hexi Main Canal Engineering Office immediately convened an on-site meeting to organize observation; each county also carried out key experiments and promoted them in an all-round way. At present,架子车 and handcarts have been widely used in the main dam and channel construction sites of mountain reservoirs in the southern mountainous area, and more than 50% of the migrant workers in the West Main Canal construction site have implemented shoulder pole carrying, and some areas have also promoted blasting to loosen the soil and high-altitude cable transport, which has greatly improved labor efficiency.

Each county and city implements long-term plans and short-term arrangements, so that the project can proceed in an orderly manner, with both sprints and rest periods, so that migrant workers can achieve a balance between work and rest in their intense labor. In the first battle of the Great War in November, the Ningshuo Detachment divided this great battle into two small battles in a planned manner. During the rest period, a comprehensive inspection and evaluation meeting was held to summarize experience and boost morale. At the same time, company meetings were held separately to mobilize and deploy, and organize challenges and responses to make the enthusiasm more full. The average work efficiency broke through nine cubic meters, striving to reach ten cubic meters. In the process of mountain and water management, in addition to creating ridge-building boards, horizontal ditch digging footboards, and land leveling harrows, the Daping Commune in Xiji County also focused on improving labor organization. The entire commune was divided into areas based on production brigades, according to the amount of manpower, the quality of the geology, and the difficulty of management, to avoid idle work and waste. In twenty-two days, the appearance of Bifeng Mountain, which is high and steep, was completely renewed.

On the water conservancy construction front, close cooperation and mutual support between various regions and departments have also promoted the smooth development of the high-efficiency movement. (Picture attached)

    规模大　效率高　劳力省
    云南宁夏各族人民大力治水
    本报昆明12日电　一个气势磅礴的农田水利建设高潮，正在云南省农村形成。全省十多万处小型和五百多件大、中型骨干水利工程已全面开工，一百二十多万各族民工正在紧张地修筑堤坝，开挖渠道。
    1958年以来，云南省兴修了大中型工程二百多件，小型工程四十多万件，形成了水利工程星罗棋布的局面，对战胜旱、洪交错的严重灾害，继续获得大丰收起了很大作用。今年，云南省总结了去年的经验，除根据云南高原的具体情况，确定以中小型为主、永久性为主、自流灌溉为主等方针外，同时，还抓紧了当前受益的工程，采取边修边用的办法，使大部分工程明年都能蓄水、灌溉。玉溪县今年将把分布在平坝四周山谷里的二十九个大、中型水库和八十多个坝塘连结起来，组成一个比较完整的自流灌溉网，可灌溉农田十四万亩。晋宁县的大河水库已完成73％，蓄水二百多万立方米，现在，他们力争明年2月全部修好，蓄水八百万立方米，灌溉农田一万五千亩。
    今年云南省在兴修水利中大搞群众运动，吸取去年大搞工具改革保证高工效的经验，一开始就做到了省劳力、工效高。据红河哈尼族彝族自治州等八个专区（州）的统计，在上阵前就改良赶制出牛、马车、手推车、飞兜、铁轨等各种水利施工工具十六万八千多件和大量的爆破器材，一般筑坝工效都比去年提高一倍以上。晋宁县大河干渠实现车子化、牛犁化、拉耙化以后，原订一百六十二天完工的计划将提前九十八天完成。
    据宁夏日报消息　一个以技术革新为中心的高工效运动，已经在宁夏回族自治区各水利工地上开花结果。二十万水利英雄决心大干12月，基本修好西干渠第一期工程和山区水库渠道，并且大搞水土保持和排灌网，提前和超额完成今冬明春水利建设任务。
    今冬水利建设开始以后，群众干劲越来越大，发明创造越来越多，劳动效率越来越高。许多单位的平均日工效都超过了五立方米。从10月1日到12月1日，短短两个月的时间，已完成土石方一千六百五十万立方米，增加灌溉面积十四万五千亩，控制水土流失面积七百一十平方公里，新修和整修大小沟渠两万五千九百五十条。
    在开展以技术革新为中心的高工效运动中，各工地坚持政治挂帅，横扫右倾保守思想，充分发挥了群众的创造性。在西干渠工地上，惠农支队批判了部分干部中强调冬季施工困难多、材料缺等右倾保守思想以后，不到十天就完全用挑担代替了背斗，并用爆破松土法，使全支队平均工效从二点二五立方米，提高到五点三四立方米。青铜峡河西干渠工程处马上召开了现场会，组织观摩；各县也都通过重点试验，全面推广。目前，南部山区水库主坝和渠道工地大量采用了架子车和手推车，西干渠工地已经有50％以上的民工实行了挑担，有些地区还推广了爆破松土和高线运输，大大提高了劳动效率。
  各县、市实行长计划、短安排，使工程有秩序地进行，既有突击、又有休整，使民工在紧张的劳动中做到有劳有逸。宁朔支队在大战11月的第一战役中，就有计划地把这个大战役分成两个小战役进行。在休整中，召开了全面检查评比大会总结经验，鼓舞士气，同时分别召开连队会议，进行动员布置，组织挑战应战，把干劲鼓得更足。平均工效突破九立方米，争取达到十立方米。西吉县大坪公社在治山治水中，除过创造了培埂板、挖水平沟脚踏板、平地耙板以外，还着重改善了劳动组织，全公社以生产大队为单位，按照人力多少、地质好坏和治理的难易，划片包干，避免了窝工浪费，在二十二天当中，使山高坡陡的壁峰山面貌一新。
    在水利建设战线上，各地和各部门紧密配合，互相支援，也促进了高工效运动的顺利开展。（附图片）
