Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 30th - The Luoyang Tractor Factory workers overfulfilled the November production plan five days ahead of schedule on the 25th. In 25 days, the factory produced a total of 622 "Dongfanghong" brand tractors, successfully achieving a good start in the first month of production.

Since the official start of production on November 1, the factory's employees have launched a technical innovation campaign with overwhelming momentum, making production levels rise day by day. The workers in the steel casting workshop, always resourceful in overcoming difficulties, successfully experimented with the "three-in-one" steelmaking method overnight. This involved melting iron in a cupola furnace, pouring it into a converter to make steel, and then directly pouring it into an electric furnace for refining into cast steel. This halved the electric furnace melting time, and in the middle ten days, the cast steel produced in four days was one hundred tons more than the output in the first ten days, ensuring the timely supply of cast steel parts for tractors. The more than 600 workers in the fuel system workshop proposed more than 1,000 technical innovation proposals in more than a month, realizing more than 350 of them, generally increasing work efficiency by one to five times, with the highest reaching fourteen times. As a result, they produced 124% more tractor fuel pumps than planned in one month. Of the 700 processing steps in the entire workshop, 79% have reached or exceeded the designed quota. The workers on the tractor assembly line were even more enthusiastic, reaching a level of assembling one tractor in 19.2 minutes at the beginning of operation. On this basis, they further improved operations and tools, and since mid-month, the time to produce a tractor has quickly decreased from 19 minutes to 12 minutes, 10 minutes, and finally averaged 8 minutes and 40 seconds, exceeding the designed quota by 14%.

    洛阳拖拉机厂开工一月满堂红
    25天生产出622台拖拉机
    新华社洛阳30日电　洛阳拖拉机厂职工在25日提前五天超额完成了11月份生产计划，二十五天中全厂共生产出六百二十二台“东方红”牌拖拉机，在开工生产的第一个月里胜利实现了满堂红。
    这个工厂的职工从11月1日正式开工生产以来，就以排山倒海之势开展技术革新运动，使生产水平日日上升。一向富有克服困难精神的铸钢车间职工，一夜之间试验成功了“三联”炼钢法，即由冲天炉炼出铁水倒入转炉炼成钢水，再直接倒入电炉精炼成铸钢，使电炉熔炼时间缩短一半，中旬后四天炼出的铸钢，比上旬十天产量还多一百吨，保证了拖拉机铸钢件的及时供应。燃料系统车间的六百多名工人，在一个多月中提出技术革新建议一千多条，实现了三百五十多条，普遍提高工效一倍至五倍，最高达十四倍，因而在一个月里就生产出超过计划124％的拖拉机燃油泵；全车间七百道加工工序，已有79％达到和超过了设计定额。拖拉机总装配线上的职工更是干劲冲天，在开工之初就达到了十九点二分钟装出一台拖拉机的水平。在这一基础上，他们进一步改进操作和工具，中旬以来出一台拖拉机的时间已由十九分钟很快减少到十二分、十分，最后平均降低到八分四十秒，超过设计定额14％。
