    The Heart of a Swineherd

    Giving Piglets a Bath
    Old Master Yu of the Shanghai Meat Joint Processing Factory was experimenting with fattening pigs that were not even a month old. Suddenly, the pigs in the pen became listless. During the day, they would shake their heads and run away when they smelled feed. At night, they would toss and turn, making noise. Seeing that these pigs hadn't eaten or slept for days, their eyelids drooping, and they were wobbling when they walked and wouldn't live long, Old Yu was as anxious as an ant on a hot stove. He took their temperatures and looked at their tongues, but there was nothing wrong. He invited a veterinarian, but the veterinarian couldn't diagnose the cause either.
    That night, Old Yu moved his bedding into the pigpen and began checking each pen and each pig for the cause. The heat was stifling, and Yu Liansheng was sweating profusely in no time. He sat down on the ground to wipe his sweat and felt a burning sensation on his buttocks. He touched it and found the cement floor was scorching hot. Could it be that these piglets were sick because of the hot weather and the hot ground these past few days? As soon as he thought of this, he immediately turned on the tap and washed the pigpen with cold water.
    At this moment, the piglets were like plants after a long drought meeting sweet rain. Some opened their mouths, some perked up their ears, and they squealed with joy. When the water washed to the west, they ran to the west; when the water washed to the east, they ran to the east. Sure enough, the problem was solved.

    New Method of Treatment
    The state-run shop pig farm of Jin Kou Commune in Wuning, Jiangxi province, received seventeen hogs. These pigs all had mange, with yellow fluid constantly oozing from their bodies. When the swineherd Xie Tongren saw this, he boiled water every day to wash them with soap. After washing, he applied a layer of Vaseline to the affected area, and also put green camphor leaves under them where they slept. After more than half a month, he cured them. Who knew that in less than two days, five of the piglets started having white diarrhea. In the past, Old Xie had heard veterinarians say that this was called "white dysentery," but he didn't know how to treat it. He asked at the veterinary station, but the veterinarian had gone down to various small teams and wouldn't be back for several days. Old Xie was worried. One day, he went to the river to fetch water and heard people crossing the river say, "This year, we need to save more garlic bulbs, or we won't be able to deal with dysentery later!" Old Xie's heart stirred, and he hurried back, took out all three pounds of garlic at home, mashed it into a pulp in one go, and went into the pigpen, picking up a piglet to feed it. Who knew that the pig wouldn't eat it and struggled wildly in his arms, causing Old Xie to break out in a sweat without feeding it even a spoonful. He thought about it, and immediately got up and went back to get a bottle of white sugar that he had prepared for the festival and mixed it with the garlic juice. This time, the piglet was willing to eat it. Old Xie held the five piglets one by one in his arms and fed them spoonful by spoonful, once every four or five hours. By the third day, all the piglets had been cured.

    Saved Twelve Piglets
    One cold winter midnight, the northwest wind howled. Everyone had already crawled into their warm quilts, but Xu Jinsheng, the swineherd of Xushi People's Commune in Changshu, Jiangsu Province, was still squatting beside a sow that had just died in a daze. It turned out that after the sow gave birth to twelve piglets, she suddenly died due to excessive bleeding. Xu Jinsheng thought that the sow couldn't be saved, but he had to find a way to keep the twelve piglets that were squealing alive. He thought that milk powder could be used to raise children, so couldn't piglets be artificially fed? So, he quickly stood up, covered the piglets with straw and broken cotton blankets, and braved the northwest wind to run home. He ground a liter of soybeans into soy milk overnight, and held the piglets one by one in his arms to feed them soy milk. Day after day, he finally raised these twelve piglets.

    饲养员的心
    给猪仔冲凉
    上海肉类联合加工厂的老于师傅试验育肥还没满月，圈里养的猪突然变得懒洋洋的，白天嗅到饲料摇摇头跑开了，晚上翻来复去直吵闹，眼看这批猪几天不吃食，不睡觉，眼皮搭拉下来，走路摇摇晃晃活不长了。老于急得像热锅上的蚂蚁团团转。给它量体温，看舌头，没啥毛病。把兽医请了来，也诊断不出是什么原因。
    当天晚上，老于把铺盖搬进猪圈，逐圈逐头查起原因来了。天热得透不出气，于连生一会儿工夫就闷得满头大汗，他就地坐下擦汗休息，感到屁股下面火辣辣地烫人。用手一摸，水门汀热烘烘的。莫非这批猪仔是因为这两天天气热、地上烫出的毛病么？他一想到这里，立刻扭开自来水龙头，哗哗地用冷水冲洗起猪圈来。
    这时，猪仔像久旱逢甘雨一样，有的张开嘴巴，有的竖起耳朵，乐得哼哼直叫。水冲到西，它们奔到西，水冲到东，它们跑到东，果然药到病除了。
    新法治病
    江西武宁巾口公社国营商店养猪场收进的十七头养猪。这些猪都生了癞，满身黄水直流。饲养员谢铜仁看到了，就天天烧开水用肥皂给它们洗，洗完后在患处涂上一层凡士林，睡的地方又给垫上青樟树叶子，就这样经过半个多月才把它们治好。谁知不两天，其中又有五头小猪拉起白粪来。过去老谢听兽医说过，这叫“白痢病”，他可不知道怎样治。到兽医站一打听，兽医又下到各小队去了，三几天不可能回来。老谢正急得没办法，有一天他到河下担水，听到过渡行人说：“今年大蒜球要多留一点，要不往后拉痢可应不了急！”老谢心里一动，急忙赶了回来，把家里三斤大蒜都拿了出来一口气捣得稀烂，跨进了猪栏，抱起一头小猪就喂。谁知猪不肯吃，在他怀里鼓劲乱挣乱扎，把老谢弄出一身大汗却没有喂进一匙。他想了想，又立刻起身回去把家里一瓶准备过节用的白糖拿了来和在蒜汁里，这下小猪可肯吃了。老谢把五只小猪一只只抱在怀里一匙匙地喂，每隔四、五小时就喂一次。到第三天上，小猪都被治好了。
    救活了十二只小猪崽
    在一个严冬的午夜，西北风呼啸地刮着，人家都早已钻进了热被窝，可是江苏常熟徐市人民公社的饲养员徐金生却还蹲在一头刚死去的母猪旁发楞。原来，这头母猪生了十二头猪崽后，因流血过多突然死亡。徐金生想，母猪是救不活了，可是留下来正在吱哇吱哇叫的十二头猪崽，一定得想法让它活下来。他想到用奶粉可以把孩子养大，难道猪崽不能人工喂养吗？于是，他急忙站起身来，用稻草、破棉毯盖好了猪崽，自己顶着西北风奔回家里，连夜磨成了一升黄豆的豆浆，把猪崽逐头逐头捧在胸前用豆浆喂它。日复一日，终于喂大了这十二头猪崽。
