Window on Newsreels

    Ten Years as One Day
    Under the guidance of the Party and inspired by the General Line, we have many heroic laborers who have persevered and worked diligently for ten years as one day. What a noble quality this is!
    Newsreel No. 63 introduces three such laborers with noble qualities, all of whom are pace-setters attending the "Congress of Heroes":
    One is Li Jiude, a coal miner from the Jingxi Chengzi Coal Mine, who has not been absent for ten years. Since he entered the Chengzi Coal Mine in June 1949, he has not missed a single day of work or had a single safety accident, no matter how difficult the circumstances, and has excellently completed his coal mining tasks.
    Another is Liu Guangjin, a stoker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, who has ensured safe power generation for ten years without a single accident. In his daily work, he not only does his own work well, but also has a high degree of cooperation, unreservedly imparting his experience to others.
    There is also Zhang Jizong, a fitter at the General Machinery Factory, who has not produced a single defective product in ten years. In the past ten years, he has not only not produced a single defective product, but has also actively studied his profession and put forward more than 1,000 suggestions for technical innovations.
    In this era of great leaps forward where heroes emerge in large numbers, there are countless labor heroes like these, who are ambitious, full of a sense of ownership, and have promoted the spirit of daring to think and act, and working diligently. Moreover, they are right beside us!

    Precision Balance
    The report on "Precision Balance" in Newsreel No. 64 describes the two precision balances rushed out by the Shanghai Balance Factory to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. One is a "one-ten-thousandth gram electric balance"; the other is a "one-millionth gram micro-analysis balance".
    The "one-millionth gram micro-analysis balance" is so precise that it can accurately measure one ten-thousandth of the weight of an inch-long hair. Gently placing an inch-long hair on its weighing pan will cause the weighing pan to vibrate greatly. Because of its high precision, it is also more difficult to manufacture, and the parts are particularly small. For example, the agate knife component can only be assembled and calibrated under a magnifying glass. It is said that this type of balance is rare in the world, and it generally takes five or six years from design to manufacture, but these two precision balances were completed in two months and one and a half months respectively.
    The Shanghai Balance Factory was formed in 1958 by the merger of nine small factories. The factory equipment is still very simple, and there are no engineers. The only dozen or so technicians are all from mechanical worker backgrounds. However, because they promoted the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat's daring to think and act, and inspired by the tribute to the National Day, they finally climbed to the peak of world science.

    Cradle of the Revolution
    Here we are talking about "Newsreel" No. 63: In Nanhu Lake in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, about 140 meters away from Yan Yu Lou, two boats are parked: a silk boat and a small ferry. These seem to be two very ordinary boats, but they reveal a period of history that determined the Chinese revolution; explaining the difficult founding of our Party, looking back on the past gives our revolutionary descendants infinite encouragement and strength. …
    On July 1, 1921, fifty-seven party members from communist groups across the country selected twelve representatives including Mao Zedong, Dong Biwu, and Chen Tanqiu to hold the First National Congress of our Party in Shanghai. In order to avoid the enemy's search and arrest, the congress moved from Shanghai to Nanhu Lake in Jiaxing, where the final agenda of the congress was completed on the boat, and our great Party was born. Since then, the Chinese people's revolution has had a real leader and a correct direction.
    Thirty-eight years have passed, and the two boats that were used for the meeting at that time are of course impossible to find. The two boats mentioned above are replicas of the boats at that time, and the furnishings in the boat are exactly the same as they were then. The boat is parked in Nanhu Lake where the meeting was held. Jiaxing Lake, which was once popular for its charming Jiangnan scenery, is now most memorable for the two boats in the lake. (A Zhang)

    新闻纪录片之窗
    十年如一日
    在党的教导下，在总路线的鼓舞下，我们有着许多英雄的劳动者，始终坚持不懈，十年如一日地勤勤恳恳劳动，这是多么高尚的品质呵！
    新闻简报63号中，介绍了三位这样品质高尚的劳动者，他们都是出席“群英会”的标兵：
    一位是十年不缺勤的京西城子煤矿的采煤工人李九德。他从1949年6月进城子煤矿到现在，无论在任何困难的情况下，没有缺过一天勤，也没有出过一次安全事故，出色地完成了采煤任务。
    另一位是十年来从未出过一次事故，保证了安全发电的石景山发电厂司炉工刘光金。在日常工作中，他不仅把自己的工作做得好，还有着高度的协作精神，毫无保留地将自己的经验传授给别人。
    还有一位是十年没有出过一件废品的通用机械厂的钳工张继宗。十年来不但生产上没有出过一件废品，还积极钻研业务，提出了一千多条技术革新方面的意见。
    在我们这英雄辈出的跃进时代，像这样壮志凌云，充满主人翁自豪感，发扬了敢想敢干的精神，勤劳奋发工作的劳动英雄何止千万，而且他们就在我们身旁！
    精密天平仪
    新闻简报64号中关于“精密天平仪”的报道，描写了上海天平仪厂为庆祝建国十周年赶制的两台精密天平仪。一台是“万分之一克电动天平仪”；另一台是“百万分之一克微量分析天平仪”。
    “百万分之一克微量分析天平仪”，它精密到能准确地量出一寸长头发的万分之一的重量。在它的秤盘上轻轻地放上一根一寸长的头发，就会引起秤盘极大的震动。因为它精密度相当高，制造起来也较困难，零件也特别小。例如玛瑙刀这个零件只有在放大镜里才能装配和校正。据说这种天平仪还是世界上不多见的，一般从设计到制成得花五、六年时间，但是这二台精密的天平仪却分别在两个月和一个半月就完成了。
    上海天平仪厂是1958年由九个小厂合并起来的，厂里设备还很简陋，也没有工程师，仅有的十几个技术员都是机械工人出身。但由于他们发扬了无产阶级敢想敢干的革命精神，在向国庆献礼的鼓舞下，终于攀登上了世界科学高峰。
    革命的摇篮
    这里谈的是“新闻简报”63号：在浙江嘉兴的南湖中，离烟雨楼一百四十米左右，停泊着两条船：一条丝绸船和一条小摆渡船。看来这是两条极普通的船，但它揭示了一段决定中国革命的历史；说明了我们党的艰难缔造，抚今追昔给我们革命后代无限鼓舞和力量。……
    1921年7月1日，全国各地共产主义小组的五十七个党员选派了毛泽东、董必武、陈潭秋等十二位代表，在上海召开我们党的第一次全国代表大会。为了避开敌人的搜捕，大会从上海移到了嘉兴南湖，在船上完成了大会的最后议程，诞生了我们伟大的党。从此中国人民的革命，有了真正的领导者，有了正确的方向。
    三十八年过去了，当时开会的那两条船，当然无法找到了，前面说的两条船，就是按照当时的船仿造的，船里的陈设也和当时完全一样，船就泊在当时开会的南湖。曾经以它迷人的江南景色脍炙人口的嘉兴湖，今天，最使人留恋的还是湖中的两条船。　（阿章）
