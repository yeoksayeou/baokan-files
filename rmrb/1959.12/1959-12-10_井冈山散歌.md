    Ciping (Note)
    Jinggang Mountain is a large flower basket, and Ciping is its most beautiful flower. The tall buildings along the foot of the mountain are colorful petals, and the large golden rice fields surrounding the buildings are dazzling stamens.
    This flower is no ordinary flower; it is a revolutionary flower. It is irrigated by the blood and tears of the people of Jinggang Mountain, and it is made to bloom by the sun-like brilliance of the Party.
    Thirty years ago, this flower also bloomed exceptionally brightly. When the Red Army left, it withered. The white beasts roared: "The stones must be knifed, the thatched grass must be burned!" Newborn babies in swaddling clothes were brutally murdered, and newly built houses were turned to ashes. How many times was it washed in blood, how many times was it burned? Who can remember? Ciping, a scorched earth, a bloodstain. Which piece of land is without the blood of the people, which scoop of spring water is without the tears of the people? The stream flows day and night, never ceasing the grief of the people of Jinggang Mountain; the mountain torrents wash away year after year, never washing away the anger of the people of Jinggang Mountain. Whenever it was a night of miserable fog, sorrowful clouds, and chilling rain, people huddled together, silently reciting the Communist Party and Chairman Mao countless times. A long, long night, in need of the sun's rays.
    Ten years ago, a roar of thunder scattered the dark clouds, the sun came out, and Ciping began a new life. Ten years of spring breeze and rain, ten years of the sun's radiance, look at this flower of Jinggang Mountain, how brightly it blooms! Right on top of the weeds and rubble where people shed blood and tears, stand building after building; department stores, Jinggang Mountain Hotel, Jinggang Mountain Elementary School, People's Hospital, Communist Labor University, Museum, Auditorium, Office Buildings, Guesthouses, Nursing Homes, Stations, Post and Telecommunications Bureau... one next to the other.
    The stream sings joyfully day and night, how can it sing enough of the joy of the people of Jinggang Mountain, the beauty of the flower of Jinggang Mountain, how can it sing of the eternal glory of the Party and Chairman Mao?
    More beautiful, more beautiful, Ciping, we are watering you with sweat, coloring you with the brilliance of youth! More beautiful, more beautiful! Let people create paradise according to your appearance!
    (Note) Ciping is the center of Jinggang Mountain. During the land revolution, it was the location of the Hunan-Jiangxi Border Special Committee and the Hunan-Jiangxi Border Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Government. It is now the location of the Jinggang Mountain Party Committee and the Jinggang Mountain Administration.
    Huangyangjie
    Huangyangjie, like a majestic giant, guards the northwest border of Jinggang Mountain.
    Look, how tall, how stern! One mountain peak taller than the other, tearing many gaps in the blue sky. The breath it exhales is the pure white clouds and the magnificent fog, circling the mountainside, filling the valleys, surging, crowding, like the turbulent waves in the sea.
    When the giant holds its breath, the clouds dissipate and the fog clears, you can see a winding path, like a slender white thread, winding, curving, appearing and disappearing from the giant's shoulders. Just reaching its waist, it is cut off by a precipice and disappears from sight. Try walking this road, sometimes it is like a vertical ladder, ascending and descending requiring clinging to branches or rocks. Sometimes, the road is so narrow it is almost like a steel wire support for an acrobat, above is a steep mountain like it has been cut by a knife, below is a bottomless canyon, reaching out it seems you can touch the edge of the sky, one misstep and you fall into the abyss! ... The road of Huangyangjie, how steep, how dangerous! People say the difficulty of the Shu Road is more difficult than ascending to heaven, this is three times more difficult than the Shu Road!
    Don't sigh at its steepness, don't sigh at its danger. Revolution, how many such difficult roads has it walked? Chairman Mao and many comrades of the Party Central Committee, carried hundreds of pounds of rice - no, shouldered the ten-thousand-pound burden of the Chinese revolution, running on this dangerous road. The heroic Red Army, relied on the steepness of Huangyangjie, to eliminate countless White bandits. Standing on the edge of these old trenches, looking at the overlapping peaks and ridges, picking up a green bullet casing, gathering a bouquet of nameless mountain flowers, one cannot help but think of Chairman Mao's famous verse: "The roar of cannons on Huangyangjie, reported the enemy's night flight!" But, why is there still the sound of cannons? Listen:
    "Rumble..." The giant laughs heartily. "Whirr..." The giant shakes its robe. This is the roar of blasting to clear the mountain and open the road! This is the red flag of the Jinggang Mountain people's labor fluttering! They want to turn this winding path that Chairman Mao walked into a wide highway, so that people can come by car to see Huangyangjie, to see a difficult road that the Chinese revolution has traveled.
    Beside Dragon Pool
    The water of Dragon Pool, clear and transparent, like a cat's eye.
    Beside Dragon Pool, sits an old man with white hair and a silver beard. He holds a wooden bucket with both hands, and in the bucket is a dogfish he just caught. The dogfish is uneasy in its new environment, striking the water in the bucket with a crackling sound, and water droplets splash directly onto the old man's face. The old man pays no attention to it, staring at the pool in a daze.
    Old man, go back, your son, from whom you have been separated for ten years, is waiting for you to recount your father-son relationship. Your old partner is waiting for your delicious dogfish to be cooked, to welcome the son who has returned from afar.
    The old man does not move, looking at his reflection in the pool.
    A gust of breeze passes, and gentle ripples ripple across the pool. The reflection in the pool turns into a handsome young man. The old man returns to his youth...
    It was also a clear and refreshing autumn, and he and his companions caught a dogfish here. They happily sent the dogfish to Commissar Mao (at that time, the people of Jinggang Mountain called Chairman Mao Commissar Mao). Commissar Mao smiled and talked kindly with them: "You say that dogfish live by eating small fish, this is a tyrant among fish, and should be beaten. Local bullies and evil gentry live by exploiting us poor people, they are dogfish among humans, people who eat people, we must overthrow them, and we will surely be able to overthrow them! ..."
    So, he picked up a gun and joined the Red Army. Attacking Fujian, fighting Changsha, sweeping across thousands of miles of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Trekking through mountains and rivers, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, appearing and disappearing in a hail of bullets, all for the sake of hitting "dogfish". He was wounded, and the Red Army went north. The "dogfish" - the White bandits - counterattacked him madly - tiger benches, pepper water, needle pricks, burning - in a few days, his hair turned white and his back bent. However, Chairman Mao's smile, like a kind hand, constantly caressed his wounds, Commissar Mao's firm voice, rang in his ears all day long. He never wavered in his belief in eliminating the "dogfish".
    On the first day of the liberation of his hometown, he stir-fried a bowl of dogfish, bought two pounds of rice wine, and sent off his only son: "Go, son, your father is old, you take your father's place and eliminate all the 'dogfish' in China." Today, his son has returned, wearing a row of shiny medals on his chest. The old man smiled so hard that his silver beard trembled, holding his son's shoulders and looking at him again and again. Then, while his son was washing his face, he came to Dragon Pool, determined to catch a dogfish, and have a hearty drink with the hero who fought the "dogfish".
    The old man, carrying the wooden bucket, walked towards the village with strong steps, forgetting for a moment the anxious old partner in the kitchen, forgetting the son he had been separated from for ten years, with only Chairman Mao's kind smiling image in his heart, and only Chairman Mao's voice in his ears...

    井冈山散歌
    吕云松
    茨坪（注）
    井冈山是一只大花篮，茨坪，是一朵最美丽的花。沿着山脚的高大楼房，是五彩的花瓣，楼房环绕的大块金色的稻田，是绚丽的花蕊。
    这朵花不是寻常的花，她是一朵革命之花。灌溉它的是井冈山人民的血和泪，使她开放的是党的太阳般的光辉。
    三十年前，这朵花也曾开得异常鲜艳。红军走了，她也随之而枯萎。白色的野兽咆哮着：“石头要过刀，茅草要过火！”刚入襁褓的婴儿惨遭毒手，刚盖好的房子成为灰烬。血洗了多少次，火烧了多少回？谁能记得清？茨坪啊，一片焦土，一片血迹。哪一块土地没有人民的鲜血啊，哪一勺泉水没有人民的眼泪？小溪的水日夜流着，流不尽井冈山人的悲痛；山洪年年冲刷，冲不走井冈山人的愤怒。每当惨雾愁云凄风冷雨之夜，人们相依相偎，默念过多少次共产党和毛主席。漫漫长夜啊，需要太阳的照耀。
    十年前一声雷吼，乌云散了，太阳出来了，茨坪，开始了新的生命。十年春风春雨，十年太阳的光辉，你看这井冈山之花，她开得多么鲜艳！就在那人们洒过血泪的荒草、瓦砾之上，耸立着一栋又一栋的楼房；百货商店、井冈山饭店、井冈山小学、人民医院、共产主义劳动大学、博物馆、大礼堂、办公大楼、宾馆、敬老院、车站、邮电局……一个挨着一个。
    小溪的水日夜欢唱，那能唱得完井冈山人的喜悦，井冈山之花的美丽，那能唱得了党和毛主席永恒的光辉？
    更美丽、更美丽些，茨坪，我们在用汗珠为你浇灌，用青春的光彩为你着色！更美丽，更美丽些！让人们按照你的模样去创造天堂！
    （注）茨坪，是井冈山的中心。土地革命时期，是湘赣边界特委、湘赣边界工农兵政府的所在地。现在为井冈山党委和井冈山管理局的所在地。
    黄洋界
    黄洋界，像一个威武的巨人，守卫在井冈山的西北边。
    你瞧，它多么高大，多么严峻！一座比一座高的山峰，把蓝天划破许多缺口。它呼出的气，便是那洁白的云朵和磅礴的大雾，绕着山腰，铺满山坳，奔腾着，拥挤着，像大海里汹涌的波涛。
    当巨人屏住呼吸，云消雾散的时候，可以看见一条羊肠小道，像一根纤细的白线，弯弯曲曲若断若续地从巨人肩端垂下。刚到腰边，便被悬岩切断，看不见了。你试着走走这条路吧，有时它像一架垂直的梯子，上下必须攀着树枝或岩石。有时，路狭得几乎像杂技团支架的一根钢丝，上面是刀削的一样的陡山，下面是无底的峡谷，一伸手似乎可以摸到天沿，一失足便掉下万丈深渊！……黄洋界的路啊，多么陡，多么险！人说蜀道之难难于上青天，这比蜀道还要难三分！
    别叹它陡啊，别叹它险。革命啊，走了多少这样的艰难的道路？毛主席和党中央的很多同志，曾背着成百斤成百斤的米——不，背负中国革命的万斤重担，奔波在这条险道之上。英勇的红军，曾凭着黄洋界的险峻，消灭过数不清的白匪。站在这旧日战壕的边沿，看着层峰叠峦，拾一颗发绿的弹壳，采一束无名的山花，不禁想起毛主席著名的诗句：“黄洋界上炮声隆，报道敌军宵遁！”可是，为什么现在还有炮声？你听：
    “轰隆隆……”巨人发出大笑。“哗啦啦……”巨人抖动衣袍。这是劈山开路的爆破声在吼！这是井冈山人劳动的红旗在飘！他们要把毛主席走过的这条羊肠小道，修成一条宽阔的公路，让人们都能坐着汽车来看看黄洋界，看看中国革命所走过的一段艰巨的道路。
    龙潭边
    龙潭的水，清澈透明，像一颗猫儿眼睛。
    龙潭边，坐着一位白发银须的老人。他双手扶着木桶，木桶里装着一条刚才捕获的狗鱼。狗鱼不安于新的环境，击得桶里的水噼啪作响，水点儿直溅到老人脸上。老人并不理会，两眼瞅着潭水出神。
    老人啊，回去吧，你分别了十年的儿子，等着你叙说父子之情。你的老伴儿等着你的美味的狗鱼下锅，为远方归来的儿子洗尘哩。
    老人一动不动，看着潭水里自己的倒影。
    一阵微风过去，潭水泛起轻轻的涟漪。潭里的倒影变成一个英俊的青年。老人回到青年时期……
    也是一个天高气爽的秋天，他和同伴们在这儿捉到一条狗鱼。他们兴高彩烈地把那条狗鱼送给毛委员（当时井冈山人民称毛主席为毛委员）。毛委员微笑着，和他们亲切地谈话：“你们说狗鱼靠吃小鱼过活，这是鱼中的恶霸，应该打。土豪劣绅靠剥削我们穷人过活，是人里面的狗鱼，是吃人的人，我们更要打倒他，一定能打倒他！……”
    于是，他便拿起了枪，参加了红军。攻福建，打长沙，横扫湘鄂赣一千余里。跋山涉水，风餐露宿，出没于枪林弹雨之中，为的是打“狗鱼”。他负伤了，红军北上了。“狗鱼”——白狗子疯狂地对他反噬——老虎凳、辣椒水、针刺、火烧——几天功夫，他头发白了，背脊弯了。然而，毛主席的微笑，像一只慈祥的手，不断地抚摸他的伤口，毛委员金石般的声音，整日铿锵地响在耳边。他没有动摇过消灭“狗鱼”的信念。
    家乡解放的第一天，他炒了一碗狗鱼，打了两斤米酒，送走了自己独生的儿子：“去吧孩子，爸爸老了，你代爸爸去把全中国的‘狗鱼’通通消灭。”今天，儿子回来了，胸前佩着一排闪亮的勋章。老人笑得银须不住地抖动，扳着儿子的肩膀看了又看。然后，趁儿子洗脸的时候，来到龙潭边，决心捕一条狗鱼，和打“狗鱼”的英雄痛饮一番。
    老人提着木桶，迈着壮健的步伐向村子走去，一时间忘了厨房里焦急的老伴，忘了分别十年的儿子，心里只有毛主席亲切的笑影，耳边只有毛主席的说话声……。（附图片）
