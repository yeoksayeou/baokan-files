Xinhua News Agency, December 12th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata" (Red Flag), published an editorial today calling on all JCP members to strive for the victorious unfolding of the tenth national unified action on the 22nd to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and calling for a focus on organizing the political struggle of the working class, and striving to launch a demonstration even larger than the one held on "May Day" before Kishi Nobusuke goes to the United States to sign the new treaty.

The editorial pointed out that the Japanese people, with the working class as the center, disregarding the persecution and intimidation of the Kishi Nobusuke government, organized meetings, strikes, and demonstrations in 750 places nationwide. In the face of the mass movement, the various conspiracies of the Trotskyites also finally failed. The editorial emphasized that, at present, while the people across the country are working hard to win the tenth unified action, they must see the current complex situation clearly, pay attention to improving the content of the unified action and expanding its scale.

When discussing how to improve the content of the workers' and people's unified action, the editorial pointed out that, first of all, it is necessary to clearly recognize the main enemy and organize a struggle aimed at the target. The spearhead of the Japanese workers' and people's patriotic and just struggle must be directed at U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet; at the same time, it is also necessary to oppose acts that undermine unity and solidarity.

The editorial pointed out that, in order to expand the scale of the unified action to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," it is necessary to focus on expanding the organization of joint struggles in various parts of the country, especially to universally establish joint struggle organizations in rural areas; to promote the participation of farmers, citizens, cultural figures, and women in joint struggle organizations, and to establish cooperative relations with these social strata; to convene plenary representative meetings of member organizations of the central joint struggle organization and national representative meetings. The editorial said that this is the current urgent task.

Xinhua News Agency, December 11th, Tokyo Dispatch: Approximately 500 farmer representatives from ten prefectures in the Tohoku and Hokuriku regions of Japan held a rally in front of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry building in Tokyo today, unanimously demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government immediately stop the negotiations held to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and demanding an increase in the purchase price of rice for the next year.

Nozoe Masaru, chairman of the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation, Kato Mankichi, secretary of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), Kanda Daisaku, director of the Socialist Party's farmers' department, and Iwama Masao, representative of the Communist Party, all spoke at the meeting.

Kato called on farmers to strengthen cooperation with workers and continue to fight to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Kanda accused the Kishi Nobusuke government of claiming that it could not raise the rice purchase price because of financial difficulties, but on the other hand, it was going to give war reparations to South Vietnam and waste a lot of foreign exchange in the production of American aircraft.

Kanda emphasized that the farmers' demands could not be realized unless such a government was overthrown.

Iwama pointed out that in order to prevent the signing of a new "Security Treaty" that would lead to the demise of the Japanese nation, workers, farmers, and citizens should unite more closely to launch a struggle and prevent Kishi Nobusuke from visiting the United States.

Many trade union representatives also gave speeches to encourage the farmers' struggle.

After the meeting, the farmer representatives submitted petitions demanding the cessation of U.S.-Japan negotiations to Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Liberal Democratic Party.

    “赤旗报”号召为胜利开展第十次统一行动而奋斗
    斗争矛头应指向美国和岸政府
    日本十个县农民代表集会反对日美谈判修改“安全条约”
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日共全体党员为了在22日胜利地展开阻止修改日美“安全条约”第十次全国统一行动而奋斗，并且号召着重组织工人阶级的政治斗争，为在岸信介赴美签订新条约以前展开一个比“五一”劳动节举行的规模更大的示威运动而努力。
    社论指出，以工人阶级为中心的日本人民不顾岸信介政府的迫害和恫吓，在全国七百五十个地方有组织地举行了集会、罢工和示威游行。在群众运动面前，托洛茨基分子的各种阴谋也终于失败。社论强调指出，目前，全国人民在努力争取胜利展开第十次统一行动的同时，必须看清目前的复杂局势，注意提高统一行动的内容和扩大统一行动的规模。
    社论在谈到如何提高工人和人民的统一行动的内容的问题时指出，首先，必须明确地认清主要敌人，并且组织对准目标的斗争。日本工人和人民的爱国、正义的斗争的矛头必须指向美帝国主义和岸信介内阁；同时还要反对破坏统一和团结的行为。
    社论指出，为了扩大阻止修改日美“安全条约”的统一行动的规模，必须在全国各地着重扩大共同斗争的组织，尤其是要在农村中普遍建立共同斗争组织；促使农民、市民、文化界人士和妇女参加共同斗争组织，并且建立同这些社会阶层的合作关系；召开中央共同斗争组织成员团体的全体代表会议和全国代表会议。社论说，这是目前的迫切任务。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本东北和北陆地方十个县的农民代表约五百人今天在东京农林省大厦前面举行集会，一致要求岸信介政府立即停止为修改日美“安全条约”而举行的谈判，并且要求提高明年度大米的收购价格。
    全日本农民协会联合会会长野沟胜、日本工会总评议会干事加藤万吉、社会党农民部长神田大作和共产党代表岩间正男都在会上讲了话。
    加藤号召农民加强同工人的合作，继续为阻止修改日美“安全条约”而斗争。
    神田指责岸信介政府一方面宣称因为财政困难而不能提高大米收购价格，但是另一方面却要给予南越战争赔偿，并且在生产美国飞机方面浪费很多外汇。
    神田强调指出，像这样的政府，不打倒，农民的要求就无法实现。
    岩间指出，为了阻止签订会使日本民族灭亡的新“安全条约”，工人、农民和市民应该更加团结起来展开斗争，并且阻止岸信介访问美国。
    许多工会代表也发表讲话鼓舞农民的斗争。
    大会结束后，农民代表向日本首相岸信介、农林相和自由民主党提交了要求停止日美谈判的请愿书。
