Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: This year, China's coal industry system has achieved fruitful results in the technical revolution and technical innovation. The 179 major advanced experiences recently summarized by the Ministry of Coal Industry are the essence of the achievements of the technical revolution and technical innovation in national coal mines this year. The widespread promotion of these advanced experiences in national coal mining enterprises will play a huge role in the sustained and high-speed development of China's coal industry.

These 179 advanced experiences were developed on the basis of the 36 important experiences proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry in March this year. In the past nine months, not only have the original advanced experiences been greatly developed and improved in production practice, but also many effective new experiences have been created and discovered by various units. Among the 179 experiences summarized recently, there are not only experiences suitable for widespread promotion in large coal mines, but also experiences suitable for small coal mines; there are not only advanced experiences in mine production, capital construction, and geological exploration, but also advanced experiences in coal washing, transportation, and mining machinery manufacturing.

Implementing four (shifts) eight (hours) cross-operation in production and mine construction is the most significant advanced experience in coal mine production organization that the Ministry of Coal Industry has focused on summarizing this time. Workers reflect that implementing four-eight cross-operation is good in five ways: good production, good rest, good attendance, good study, and good entertainment. At present, the coal output of working faces using this production organization form is generally 10% to 20% higher than in the past; at the same time, costs are greatly reduced, workers' production efficiency is improved, and rest time is increased. In the process of promotion, the vast number of workers have not only created new forms of cross-operation suitable for various geological conditions and different equipment situations, but also have begun to find solutions to a series of new problems caused by the implementation of this organizational form, such as transportation, hoisting, cadre allocation, and wage distribution.

After this summary and supplement, many experiences are more systematic and complete, and some have begun to be complete sets and are developing in the direction of finalization. For example, in mechanized coal mining, the nine experiences summarized this time basically include the most advanced operating methods for the entire set of processes from notching, blasting, coal falling, coal loading, moving electric conveyors, maintaining and repairing electric conveyors, to support columns, back columns, and top release. These experiences cooperate with each other and are comprehensively promoted, which can greatly unleash the production potential of China's existing coal mines without increasing equipment and manpower, and ensure the continuous and large-scale high yield of the working face.

The advanced experiences that have been summarized in tunneling include deep-hole blasting for rapid tunneling, shallow-hole multi-cycle rapid tunneling, multi-head cross-tunneling, and water-powered excavation and water transportation, and dry excavation and water transportation, which basically summarize the most advanced tunneling methods used in various geological conditions and equipment conditions in China's coal mines. Among them, the deep-hole blasting experience created by the Zhuang Hongsheng team of Jiawang Coal Mine alone can double the tunneling speed of production mines after widespread promotion.

In terms of capital construction, the relatively mature experiences that were required to be promoted in March this year were only nine, but this time it has developed into 31, including those belonging to mine construction, civil engineering construction, mechanical and electrical installation, and construction organization management. These experiences integrate all the major inventions and creations in coal mine construction since the Great Leap Forward in China, and provide the most effective methods for building mines in a more, faster, better, and more economical way under different geological conditions. The Fengfeng Coal Mine Capital Construction Bureau and the Pingdingshan Mining Bureau adopted only five or six experiences including shaft excavation, multi-process parallel cross-operation and regular multi-cycle operation for parallel tunneling, and rapid installation of headframes, winches, and air compressors, and completed two pairs of large-scale mines with an annual production capacity of 900,000 tons in 16 and a half months and 20 months respectively, which shortened the construction period of the same type of mines stipulated by the coal industry department by nearly half, and the unit cost of the mines was also reduced by 17.6% and 14.5% respectively compared with the design requirements.

In the vigorous technical revolution and technical innovation movement over the past year, some new technologies in the coal industry have been greatly developed. In the first quarter of this year, there were not many mature specific experiences in hydraulic mining in China. However, in the recent months of the production increase and economy practice movement, the vast number of coal mine workers have successively overcome many technical and management barriers, and a large number of large-scale and continuous high-yield hydraulic mining working faces have emerged, accumulating a lot of mature experience for the rapid promotion of this new technology on a larger scale. For example, the operating experience of the water gun coal falling summarized by the Ministry of Coal Industry in Huainan Coal Mine can increase the recovery rate of hydraulic mining from about 70% to 87%. This experience solves the key problem of how to improve resource recovery rate after each mine adopts hydraulic mining.

Through the comprehensive summary of these advanced experiences, effective ways to overcome some of the weak links in the current coal mine production have also been found. The metal supports, concrete supports, bamboo supports, bolt supports, and rubble filling created by Kailuan, Pingxiang and other coal mines can save 500,000 to 800,000 cubic meters of pit wood next year as long as they are widely promoted in state-owned and larger local state-owned coal mines. The advanced experiences of road and mine cooperation, rapid loading, and the establishment of simple coal storage bins created by Fuxin, Jingxi and other coal mines can also solve the problem of insufficient transportation capacity to a large extent.

In order to further implement the policy of walking on two legs, the Ministry of Coal Industry also summarized 60 advanced experiences in 16 aspects related to the production, construction and technical transformation of small coal mines at the Second National Small Coal Mine Work Conference held not long ago.

The Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to promote these advanced experiences as an important content of the national coal mine technical revolution and technical innovation movement in the near future. Most coal mines have established full-time agencies for promoting advanced experiences, and are formulating promotion plans based on the specific conditions of their units.

　　大矿和小矿、生产和建设一年来技术革新成果巨大
    煤矿职工取得179项跃进“法宝”
    新华社28日讯　我国煤炭工业系统今年在技术革命和技术革新方面取得丰硕的成果。煤炭工业部最近总结的一百七十九项重大先进经验，就是全国煤矿今年技术革命和技术革新成就的精华。这些先进经验在全国煤矿企业普遍推广以后，对于我国煤炭工业持续地高速度地发展，将起巨大的作用。
    这一百七十九项先进经验是在今年3月煤炭工业部提出三十六项重要经验的基础上发展起来的。九个多月来，不但原有的先进经验在生产实践中有了很大的发展和提高，各单位还创造和发现了不少行之有效的新经验。最近总结的一百七十九项经验中，不仅有适用于大型煤矿普遍推广的经验，也有适用于小型煤矿的经验；不仅有矿井生产、基本建设、地质勘探等方面的先进经验，也有洗煤、运输、矿山机械制造等方面的先进经验。
    在生产和矿井建设方面实行四（班）八（小时）交叉作业，是煤炭工业部这次着重总结的煤矿生产组织上的一项最重大的先进经验。职工们反映，实行四八交叉作业有五好：生产好、休息好、出勤好、学习好、娱乐好。目前，凡是采用这种生产组织形式的工作面，煤产量一般都比过去提高10％到20％；同时，成本有很大降低，工人的生产效率提高，休息时间增加。广大职工在推广中，不仅创造了在各种不同地质条件和不同设备情况下采用不同交叉作业的新形式，而且对于实行这一组织形式后引起的运输、提升、干部配备、工资分配等一系列新问题，也开始找到了解决办法。
    经过这次总结和补充，许多经验更加系统和完整了，有的已经开始成套，并且向定型的方向发展。例如在机械化采煤方面，这次总结的九项经验中，基本上包括了从掏槽、爆破、落煤、装煤、移电溜子、维护检修电溜子，直到支柱、回柱、放顶等成套工序的最先进的操作方法。这些经验互相配合，综合推广，就可以在不增加设备和人力的条件下，大大发挥我国现有煤矿的生产潜力，保证工作面持久地大面积高产。
    在掘进方面已经总结出来的深孔爆破快速掘进，浅孔多循环快速掘进，多头交叉掘进，以及水掘水运、旱掘水运等先进经验，也基本上概括了我国煤矿中各种地质条件和设备条件下所采用的最先进的掘进方法。其中仅是贾汪煤矿庄洪生小组创造的深孔爆破一项经验，普遍推广以后就能使生产矿井的掘进速度加快一倍。
    在基本建设方面，今年3月要求推广的比较成熟的经验还只有九项，这次已经发展成为三十一项，有属于矿井建设的、土木建筑的、机电安装的、施工组织管理的等。这些经验综合了我国大跃进以来煤矿建设方面所有的重大发明创造，为在不同地质条件下多快好省地建设矿井提供了最有效的方法。峰峰煤矿基本建设局和平顶山矿务局仅采用其中的井筒开凿、平行掘进的多工序平行交叉作业和正规多循环作业，快速安装井架、绞车、压风机等五、六项经验，就分别以十六个半月和二十个月建成了两对年产能力各九十万吨的大型矿井，比煤炭工业部门规定的同类型矿井建设期限缩短了将近一半，而且矿井的单位造价也比设计要求分别降低17.6％和14.5％。
    在一年来轰轰烈烈的技术革命和技术革新运动中，煤炭工业的一些新技术有了很大发展。今年第一季度，我国水力采煤方面成熟的具体经验还不多。但是，在最近几个月的增产节约运动中，广大煤矿职工接连攻破了许多技术关和管理关，涌现出大批大面积持续高产的水力采煤工作面，为在更大范围内迅速推广这一新技术积累了很多成熟的经验。例如煤炭工业部总结的淮南煤矿水枪落煤的操作经验，就可以使水力采煤的回采率从70％左右提高到87％。这项经验解决了各矿采用水力采煤后如何提高资源回收率的关键问题。
    通过这些先进经验的全面总结，对于当前煤矿生产中的一些薄弱环节，也找到了有效的克服办法。开滦、萍乡等煤矿创造的金属支架、混凝土支架、竹材支架、螺栓支架、片石发?等，明年只要在国营和较大地方国营煤矿中普遍推广，就可以节约坑木五十万到八十万立方米。阜新、京西等煤矿创造的路矿协作、快速装车、建立简易贮煤仓等先进经验，也可以在很大程度上解决运输能力不足的问题。
    为了进一步贯彻两条腿走路的方针，煤炭工业部在不久以前举行的全国第二次小型煤矿工作会议上，还总结了十六个方面的六十条有关小型煤矿生产、建设和进行技术改造的先进经验。
    煤炭工业部已经决定在最近一个时期内，以推广这些先进经验作为全国煤矿技术革命和技术革新运动的重要内容。大部分煤矿已经成立推广先进经验的专职机构，并且正在根据本单位具体情况，订出推广的规划。
