Electric fishing experiments in Guangxi and Heilongjiang have yielded good results. The electric fishing method is very simple: just install a small electric motor (or connect to another power source) and a switch in the fishing boat, and run an electric wire from the power source to the bottom of the boat. When fishing, intermittently open and close the switch, and the electrified wire in the water will create an electromagnetic field in the water. When schools of fish enter the range of the electromagnetic field, they will be shocked and paralyzed, and float to the surface. In order to use this method for fishing production, Guangxi and Heilongjiang provinces and regions will continue to conduct experiments in this area in 1960.

    用电捕鱼试验成功
    广西、黑龙江试验的用电捕鱼已获得良好效果。用电捕鱼的方法很简单，只要在捕鱼船里安上一个小电动机（或接其他电源）装上一个开关，用电线插上电源通往船底。捕鱼的时候，间歇地开闭电门，水中的电线经通电后在水层中形成电磁场。鱼群进入电磁场的范围，就会触电麻痹，漂游起水面。为了使这种方法用于捕捞生产，广西、黑龙江两省区，将在1960年继续进行这一方面的试验。
