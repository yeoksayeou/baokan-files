　　Persisting in Theoretical Study for Seven Years
　　Liu Dejun, First Secretary of the Luotian County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    The vast number of cadres in Luotian County, Hubei Province, have been persistently studying political theory "as if it were one day for seven years" since 1953. They have systematically studied the ABCs of political economy, political economy, philosophy, the "Eight Congress" documents, and Chairman Mao's works. This has cultivated a good habit of studying political theory, and the cadres have greatly improved in their political thinking and work style.

    The process of persisting in political theory study for seven years is a process of continuous revolution in political thinking and a process of continuous improvement in learning methods. We have learned that: only by persisting in regular political theory study can we continuously improve the political and ideological level of cadres; only by adhering to the principle of integrating theory with practice can we give full play to the great role of revolutionary theory in transforming the subjective and objective world; and only when leaders take the lead in persisting in study can we ensure that the study movement is carried out persistently and in depth.

    To work well, one must study well. We started to grasp the political theory education of cadres based on this understanding. Since 1953, the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee has been equipped with full-time theoretical education cadres, and the District Party Committee also has a dedicated person in charge. In order to strengthen the leadership of political theory study, the County Party Committee established a central study group and stipulated that each member of the County Party Committee should take the lead in studying, speaking, and writing. Not only has this been maintained, but it has also developed. In the past, members of the County Party Committee took the lead in studying, speaking, and writing. Now, members of the Commune Party Committee and branch secretaries also take the lead in studying, speaking, and writing. This year alone, the eighteen members of the County Party Committee have made a total of fifty-two study reports and written one hundred and seventy-four articles that are rich in ideological content and combativeness. The leading study by Party committee members at all levels has greatly encouraged the cadres. Comrade Zhang Yuxiang, the county's model student and first secretary of the Luotuo'ao Commune Party Committee, insists on reading newspapers, documents, and books for one to two hours every night, which has motivated the cadres of the entire commune to persist in their studies, making the commune a model learning unit. Among the sixty-five learning models commended in the county this year, twenty-six are Party secretaries or branch secretaries at all levels.

    The role of leaders is not only limited to taking the lead in learning, speaking, and writing, but also in effectively solving the problems exposed by cadres in their studies. For example, at the beginning of the organization of the study, some people raised the issue that "work is too busy, there is no time to study" or "if you want to study, you can't work"; etc. In response to this situation, the County Party Committee writing group wrote an article entitled "Sharpening the Sickle Does Not Take Up Labor Time" and organized cadres to conduct debates on the issues of "busy vs. study" and "study vs. use." In the debate, various localities adopted methods of comparing good and bad examples, criticized the view that "study is optional," clarified the importance of study, and greatly increased the cadres' interest in learning. Various localities also proposed the method of "lectures in large meetings, casual talks in small meetings, and reading after meetings" to overcome the contradiction between being busy and studying. Once the ideological problem was solved, the study persisted.

    The purpose of study is to improve work, so it must be linked to practice. On this issue, there are often two attitudes: one is the bookworm who advocates simply memorizing books and is unwilling to link them to ideological reality; the other is the person who is afraid of reading, who advocates studying practical work problems and is unwilling to study hard. Here, there are both viewpoint problems and methodological problems. We have insisted on combining the study of basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism with the study of the current party's policies, combining the study of the Party's policies with the study of the current reality, and adhering to the principle of using the abstract to lead the concrete, discussing the abstract in terms of the concrete, and combining the abstract with the concrete, constantly criticizing all kinds of erroneous views that separate theory from practice. When cadres of the County Bank were studying dialectics, they discussed the relationship between policies and tasks, criticized the erroneous view that policies cannot be implemented if tasks are to be completed and that tasks cannot be completed if policies are to be implemented, and recognized the indivisible unity of the two. The cadres of Tiantang Commune originally believed that the commune had poor mountains and land, few people and a lot of fields, and inconvenient transportation, making it difficult to develop production. After studying and criticizing "conditionalism," they led the masses to carry out a large-scale production increase movement this spring, which increased the total output of autumn grain in the commune by 30% and doubled the income from diversified operations. In August, the cadres of this commune studied the General Line again, criticized and overcame the conservative idea of "reaching the peak of production increase," and production continued to leap forward, completing the autumn planting task twenty days ahead of last year and exceeding the quota by 13,000 mu. The cadres reflected, "Studying theory well can really solve practical problems."

    A study system is very necessary. The study organization of the whole county is a network of two systems of institutions and rural areas, under the unified leadership of Party organizations at all levels. Institutions stipulate that they must study for seven to nine hours a week and take exams once a month; for cadres who go to the countryside frequently, it is stipulated that they must bring books, notes, and study tasks; make up for missed classes, and make up for missed exams. We also sharply criticized those who did not abide by the system. Five section chiefs and bureau directors of the County People's Committee did not participate in the study in the morning when they returned from the countryside. Deputy County Chief Jin Can personally led a meeting to criticize them, and they improved afterwards. This year, more than 230 cadres from county-level institutions who went to the countryside to fight drought all scored above 80 in the examinations upon their return to the institutions.

    At the same time, we have also adopted methods such as planting red flags, setting up pacesetters, holding on-site meetings, and visiting and comparing to promote learning. In institutions, we have also organized flexible and diverse mutual aid groups, "calling names," learning exhibitions, blackboards, etc., to serve learning.

    Only by correctly understanding the objective world can we correctly transform the objective world. This sentence accurately illustrates the importance of studying revolutionary theory. In recent years, our practice has fully confirmed this point. We are determined to further study political theory, especially Chairman Mao's works and the Party's General Line, and to do a better job in the county's production and construction.

　　坚持理论学习七年
　　中共罗田县委第一书记　刘德俊
    湖北罗田县的广大干部，从1953年起，“七年如一日”的坚持着政治理论学习，先后比较系统地学习了政治经济学常识、政治经济学、哲学、“八大”文件和毛主席的著作，培养了学习政治理论的良好习惯，干部在政治思想上、工作作风上有了很大提高。
    七年坚持政治理论学习的过程，是政治思想上不断革命的过程，是学习方法上不断改进的过程。我们体会到：只有坚持经常的政治理论学习，才能不断地提高干部的政治思想水平；只有坚持贯彻理论联系实际的学习方针，才能发挥革命理论改造主观世界和客观世界的巨大作用；只有领导带头坚持学习，才能保证学习运动开展得持久、深入。
    要工作好，必须要学习好。我们就是在这个认识基础上开始抓干部的政治理论教育的。从1953年起，县委宣传部配备了专职的理论教育干部，区委也有专人负责。为加强对政治理论学习的领导，县委成立了中心学习小组，并且规定了每个县委委员要带头学、带头讲、带头写。现在不仅坚持下来了，而且还有了发展。过去是县委委员带头学、带头讲、带头写，现在是公社党委委员、总支书记也带头学、带头讲、带头写了。仅在今年以来，十八个县委委员共作学习报告五十二次，写出了富有思想性和战斗性的文章一百七十四篇。层层党委委员带头学习，对干部的鼓舞很大。县特等学习模范、骆驼坳公社党委第一书记张玉祥同志，每天晚上要坚持读一至两个钟头的书报、文件，带动了全社干部坚持学习，使公社也成了模范学习单位。全县今年评出的六十五个学习模范中，有二十六个是各级党委书记、总支书记。
    领导的作用，不只是限于带头学、讲、写，而是在于切实地解决干部从学习中暴露出来的问题。如刚开始组织学习的时候，有的人提出：“工作忙了，没有时间学”、“要学习就不能工作”；等等。针对这种情况，县委写作小组写了一篇“磨镰不占工”的文章，并组织干部对“忙与学”、“学与用”的问题开展了辩论。在辩论中，各地采取好坏对比的办法，批判了“学习可有可无论”，明确了学习的重要性，使干部学习兴趣大大提高。各地还提出了“大会讲课、小会漫谈、会后读书”的办法，来克服忙与学的矛盾。思想问题解决了，学习也坚持下来了。
    学习的目的是提高工作，因此必须联系实际。在这个问题上往往持有两种态度：一种是读死书的人，主张单纯啃书，不愿意联系思想实际；另一种是怕读书的人，主张研究实际工作问题，不愿意刻苦读书。这里有观点问题，也有方法问题。我们坚持了学习马克思列宁主义的基本知识与学习当前党的方针政策相结合，学习党的方针政策与研究当前的实际相结合，坚持了以虚带实，就实论虚，虚实结合，不断地批判了把理论与实际分割开来的种种错误观点。县银行的干部在学习辩证法时，讨论了政策与任务的关系，批判了要完成任务就不能执行政策；要执行政策就不能完成任务的错误论调，认识了两者不可分割的一致性。天堂公社的干部，原来认为公社内山大地瘦，人少田多，交通不便，生产难于发展，经过学习批判了“唯条件论”后，今春领导群众大搞增产运动，使全社秋粮总产量增加了三成，多种经营收入翻了一番。8月份，这个公社的干部再一次学习总路线，批判和克服了“增产到顶论”的保守思想，生产继续跃进，比去年提前二十天并超额一万三千亩完成了秋种任务。干部反映说：“真正地学好了理论，到底能解决实际问题。”
    学习制度是非常必要的。全县的学习组织，是机关、农村两盘网，由各级党组织统一领导。机关规定每周要学习七至九小时，每月考试一次；对流动性大的下乡干部，规定出外要带书本，带笔记，带学习任务；缺课的补课，缺考的补考。我们对于不遵守制度的人，也进行了尖锐的批判，县人民委员会有五个科、局长，下乡回来，早上不参加学习，副县长金灿同志，亲自领导开会批评，以后就变好了。今年县直属机关下乡抗旱的二百三十多个干部，回机关考试的成绩都在八十分以上。
    与此同时，我们还采取了插红旗、树标兵、开现场会、参观评比等方法，来促进学习。在机关里还组织了灵活多样的互助组、点将台、学习展览会、黑板报等，为学习服务。
    只有正确地认识了客观世界，才能够正确地去改造客观世界，这句话千真万确地说明了学习革命理论的重要性。几年来，我们的实践完全证实了这点。我们决心进一步学习政治理论，特别是学习毛主席的著作和党的总路线，把全县的生产、建设工作搞得更好。
