Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch:

    Beijing’s returned overseas Chinese held a forum today, expressing full support for the suggestions put forward by our government for a comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue existing between China and Indonesia, and demanded that Indonesia immediately cease its anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. Returned overseas Chinese in Beijing also welcome all displaced Overseas Chinese who are unwilling to continue living in Indonesia to return to the country.

    The returned overseas Chinese who attended the forum unanimously and strongly condemned Indonesia's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities as extremely unfriendly actions towards the Chinese people, repaying kindness with ingratitude, and being ungrateful and forgetting favors. Li Fandong, an Indonesian returned overseas Chinese and employee of the North China Radio Equipment Factory, said that the vast majority of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia are working people who have used their own hands, together with the local people, to shed blood and sweat and make contributions to the development and prosperity of the Indonesian economy. He cited the Red Creek Massacre of 1740 as an example to illustrate the flesh-and-blood friendship between Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people. He said that in this incident, Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people fought side by side against the Dutch colonialists, and more than 10,000 Overseas Chinese were massacred. However, now Indonesia disregards the contributions made by Overseas Chinese to the local economy and the flesh-and-blood friendship between the two peoples, and treats Overseas Chinese with the same methods as the Dutch colonialists, which is extremely infuriating. Liu Yunsheng, a Jakarta returned overseas Chinese and employee of the North China Radio Equipment Factory, said that our Overseas Chinese have made certain contributions to the economic development of Indonesia, and China has always been friendly to Indonesia. When Indonesia encountered difficulties, the Chinese government and people not only provided moral support but also provided material assistance. However, today Indonesia repays kindness with ingratitude and discriminates against and persecutes Overseas Chinese as nationals of hostile countries, which is extremely detrimental to the friendship between the two countries. Zhao Haipeng, a student at the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Secondary Remedial School, returned from Bandung to study in June this year. When talking about the relationship between Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people sharing weal and woe, he said that at the beginning of this year, floods occurred near Bandung, and the Overseas Chinese in Bandung worked with the local Indonesian people to fight the disaster and donated money and clothing to help the local Indonesian disaster victims. He himself also participated in ten days of voluntary labor to drain water and dig waterways. But now the West Java military authorities are using force in a frenzied manner to force Overseas Chinese in areas below the county level to relocate, resulting in bloodshed, and Overseas Chinese property has suffered huge losses, and personal safety has been seriously violated.

    The returned overseas Chinese who attended the forum unanimously pointed out that the suggestions made by Foreign Minister Chen Yi for a comprehensive solution to the Overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries are very reasonable. The Indonesian government has no reason to raise objections and should promptly negotiate with the Chinese government to resolve the issue of Overseas Chinese.

    The Beijing returned overseas Chinese also excitedly talked about: The People's Republic of China is a strong reliance for Overseas Chinese abroad, and the era of Overseas Chinese being bullied as "overseas orphans" is gone forever. Before liberation, the old Chinese government ignored the plight of Overseas Chinese. Only a liberated and strong motherland is the reliance of Overseas Chinese, and only Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government care about and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese in this way.

    The returned overseas Chinese who attended the meeting unanimously stated that the socialist construction of the motherland is developing rapidly, and the great rivers and mountains of the motherland need countless hardworking people to build. We warmly welcome Overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in construction.

    Zhong Juanniang and Liao Zhizhong, returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who attended the forum, expressed great concern about the situation of their relatives in Indonesia, and hoped that their relatives would return to the warm embrace of the motherland in the near future.

    北京市归国华侨举行座谈会
    谴责印度尼西亚反华排华活动
    关切当前侨胞处境，欢迎不愿留居的侨胞回到伟大祖国
    希望印度尼西亚政府接受我国政府建议，迅速举行谈判
    新华社12日讯　北京市归国华侨今天举行座谈会，表示完全拥护我国政府提出的全面解决存在于中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的华侨问题的建议，并且要求印度尼西亚立即停止反华、排华活动。北京市的归国华侨还欢迎流离失所、不愿继续在印度尼西亚居住的华侨全部回国。
    参加座谈会的归国华侨一致强烈谴责印度尼西亚的反华排华活动是对中国人民极不友好的行动，是以怨报德，忘恩负义。印度尼西亚归侨、华北无线电器材厂职工李蕃东说，在印度尼西亚的华侨，绝大部分是劳动人民，他们用自己的双手，同当地人民一起，为开发和繁荣印度尼西亚经济，流了血汗，作出了贡献。他举1740年的红溪事件为例，说明华侨同印度尼西亚人民的血肉友谊。他说，在这次事件中，华侨和印度尼西亚人民并肩作战，反对荷兰殖民主义者，有一万多名华侨被屠杀。但是，现在印度尼西亚不顾华侨对当地经济作出的贡献和两国人民的血肉友谊，用对待荷兰殖民主义者的手段对付华侨，这是令人十分愤慨的。雅加达归侨、华北无线电器材厂职工刘云生说，我们华侨为印度尼西亚经济的发展作出了一定的贡献，中国对印度尼西亚也一向友好。在印度尼西亚遇到困难时，中国政府和人民不仅给予了道义的支持，而且给予了物质支援。可是，印度尼西亚今天却以怨报德，把华侨当作敌对国家侨民加以歧视和迫害，这是极其不利于两国友谊的行动。北京市归国华侨中等补习学校学生赵海鹏今年6月才从万隆回国升学。他在谈到华侨和印度尼西亚人民休戚与共的关系时说，今年年初，万隆市附近发生水灾，万隆华侨和当地印度尼西亚人民一起抗灾，并且捐款捐衣救济当地印度尼西亚灾民。他自己也参加了十天排水、挖水道的义务劳动。而现在西爪哇军事当局却穷凶极恶地使用武力，强迫县以下地区的华侨迁居，发生流血事件，华侨财产受到了巨大损失，人身安全受到了严重的侵害。
    参加座谈会的归国华侨一致指出，陈毅外交部长提出的全面解决存在于两国之间的华侨问题的建议办法是十分合理的，印度尼西亚政府没有理由提出异议，应当迅速和中国政府谈判解决有关华侨的问题。
    北京归国华侨们还兴奋地谈到：中华人民共和国是国外华侨的强大依靠，华侨任人欺侮的“海外孤儿”时代已经一去不复返了。解放前，旧中国政府对华侨的苦境是置之不理的。只有解放了的、强大的祖国才是华侨的依靠，只有毛主席、共产党和人民政府才这样关心和维护华侨的正当权利和利益。
    到会的归国华侨，一致表示，祖国的社会主义建设事业正在一日千里地发展，祖国的大好山河正需要无数勤劳的人民来建设。我们热烈欢迎国外华侨回国参加建设。
    参加座谈会的印度尼西亚归侨钟娟娘、廖志中等，对他们的亲人在印度尼西亚的处境表示十分关切，并且盼望他们的亲人在不久的将来回到祖国的温暖怀抱。
