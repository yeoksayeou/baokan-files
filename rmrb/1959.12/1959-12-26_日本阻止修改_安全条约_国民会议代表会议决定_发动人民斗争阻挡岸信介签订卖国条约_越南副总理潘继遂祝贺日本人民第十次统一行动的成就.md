Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, Tokyo: The National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" held its third national representative meeting in Tokyo today. More than 200 representatives from joint struggle organizations across the country and Okinawa Island decided to do everything possible to prevent Nobusuke Kishi from going to the United States to sign a new "Security Treaty" and to continue to escalate this struggle.

The meeting first heard a general report by Hirozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the National Conference Secretariat.

Minakuchi summarized the achievements of the struggle in the nine months since the establishment of the National Conference. He said that more than 750 joint struggle organizations at all levels have now been established throughout the country, and groups from all walks of life, including cultural figures, youth, students, and women, have also successively established joint struggle organizations, which is a great achievement. He pointed out that the ten national unified actions carried out in the past have given great encouragement and confidence to the people of the country. He said that the Japanese people have achieved preliminary victories in forcing the Kishi Nobusuke government to postpone the signing of the new "Security Treaty."

Minakuchi strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for disregarding the people's firm opposition, instead strengthening its suppression and persecution of the people, and implementing a traitorous policy against the nation and the people.

The representative meeting discussed the action program for the future. The program decided that a strong people's struggle should be used to oppose Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States to sign the new "Security Treaty." The action program calls on all trade unions to hold protest strikes before January 16, the day Nobusuke Kishi is scheduled to depart for the United States. The program said that local organizations of the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the "Security Treaty" should hold many rallies throughout the country to express the people's opposition to the signing of the new "Security Treaty."

The program suggests convening representatives from local conferences to Tokyo in order to hold a national rally on January 14 to protest Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States; on the day of Kishi Nobusuke's departure, the National Conference will hold a large-scale demonstration on the road leading to Haneda Airport.

According to this program, a massive people's march will set out from cities and villages all over Japan in early March to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty," demand the restoration of diplomatic relations with China, and defend the right to life. The program also suggested that a signature campaign against the revision of the "Security Treaty" should be launched immediately.

The meeting passed a declaration and an open letter to the Japanese people.

The declaration said that the ten national unified actions held repeatedly this year have helped to fully exert the power of the people and made the people believe in their own strength. The declaration pointed out that, on the other hand, the enemy is trembling in the face of the huge wave of public protest and has begun to adopt repressive measures against the people.

The declaration expressed the need to strengthen the unity of the ranks of the people's struggle. The declaration said: "The current situation shows that, as time goes by, the US imperialists and Kishi Nobusuke will become more and more isolated. We will continue to fight next year, and a bright future is unfolding before us."

The open letter to the people called on all sectors of the Japanese people to do everything possible to prevent Nobusuke Kishi from visiting the United States. The day the new treaty is signed should be a day for the people across the country to express their anger. The open letter emphasized that the duty of the Japanese people is to persevere in the struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" until the ratification of this treaty is prevented. The open letter also said: "In this way, we will contribute to the defense of peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd: Newspapers here reported today that Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Phan Ke Toai of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in answering questions raised by a reporter from the Vietnam News Agency on the 19th, expressed support for the Japanese people's struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government and the US government's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Deputy Prime Minister Phan Ke Toai said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's negotiations with the US government to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" are in fact aimed at further strengthening the U.S.-Japan military alliance, stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism, in order to pave the way for US imperialism to use Japan to promote the conclusion of a Northeast Asian military alliance and prepare to drag Japan into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and also to push the Japanese people onto a new road to war.

Deputy Prime Minister Phan Ke Toai said that during the occupation of Indochina by Japanese militarism from 1940 to 1945, the Vietnamese people suffered great disasters, and the Vietnamese people are well aware of the harm to the Vietnamese people of the revival of Japanese militarism and its alliance with US imperialism, which is currently undermining Vietnamese unity.

He said that while opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's unilateral grant of war reparations to the South Vietnamese authorities in violation of the Geneva Accords and regardless of the actual situation in Vietnam, the Vietnamese people strongly oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's negotiations with the US government on the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Both of the above-mentioned matters are contrary to peace and contrary to the wishes and interests of the people of Vietnam and Japan.

Deputy Prime Minister Phan Ke Toai said that the Vietnamese people sincerely congratulate the Japanese people on the major victory achieved in the tenth national unified action against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" held on the 22nd. He said that the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" is rising day by day, and this just struggle of the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21st: The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee issued a joint statement on the 20th, supporting the Japanese people's tenth national unified action against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The statement pointed out that the US imperialism and the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government are revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to strengthen the military alliance between the United States and Japan, step up the restoration of Japanese militarism, and turn Japan into a major US atomic war base in the Far East and Asia. The statement said that the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is a serious threat to Japan's independence and security, as well as to peace in Asia and the world.

The statement said that the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee resolutely oppose the US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government's stubborn conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Vietnamese people warmly welcome and firmly support the Japanese people's broad, resolute and sustained struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and stand in solidarity with the Japanese people in the struggle against Japan's unilateral grant of war reparations to South Vietnam and against the collusion between US imperialism, the Kishi Nobusuke government, and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities to prepare to launch wars of aggression.

The statement said that if the US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government ignore the struggle of the people throughout Japan and the severe condemnation of the people of the world, and continue to embark on the dangerous road against peace, they will surely be defeated.

　　日本阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议代表会议决定
    发动人民斗争阻挡岸信介签订卖国条约
    越南副总理潘继遂祝贺日本人民第十次统一行动的成就
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天在东京召开第三次全国代表会议。来自全国各地的共同斗争组织和冲绳岛的二百多位代表决定全力阻止岸信介去美国签订新的“安全条约”，并且使这一斗争继续高涨。
    会议首先听取了国民会议事务局长水口宏三的总报告。
    水口总结了国民会议成立以来九个月的斗争成就。他说，现在全国各地成立了七百五十多个各级共同斗争组织，文化界人士和青年、学生、妇女等各阶层团体也相继成立了共同斗争组织，这是巨大的成就。他指出，过去展开的十次全国统一行动，对全国人民给予莫大的鼓舞和信心。他说，日本人民在迫使岸信介政府延期签订新的“安全条约”方面，取得了初步胜利。
    水口强烈地谴责了岸信介政府无视人民的坚决反对，反而加强对人民的镇压和迫害，执行反民族反人民的卖国政策。
    代表会议讨论了今后的行动纲领。纲领决定，应当以强有力的人民斗争来反对岸信介去美国签署新的“安全条约”。行动纲领要求各工会在岸信介预定启程前往美国的1月16日这一天之前，举行抗议罢工。纲领说，阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议的各地组织应当在全国范围内举行许多次集会，来表示人民反对签订新的“安全条约”。
    纲领建议召集各地方会议的代表前来东京，以便在1月14日举行国民集会，抗议岸信介访美；在岸信介启程的当天，国民会议将在通向羽田机场的道路上举行大规模的示威游行。
    按照这个纲领，一个规模巨大的人民游行将在3月初从日本全国各地的城乡出发，反对修改“安全条约”，要求同中国恢复邦交和保卫生活权利。纲领还建议立即开始反对修改“安全条约”的签名运动。
    会议通过了宣言和告日本人民书。
    宣言说，今年反复举行了十次的全国统一行动有助于充分发挥人民的力量，使人民相信自己的力量。宣言指出，另一方面，敌人在公众抗议的巨大浪潮面前发抖，并开始对人民采用镇压措施。
    宣言表示要加强人民斗争的队伍的团结。宣言说：“当前的形势表明，随着时间的推移，美帝国主义者和岸信介将越来越孤立。我们明年将继续进行斗争，在我们面前展示着光辉的前景”。
    告人民书号召日本人民各阶层竭尽全力来阻止岸信介访问美国。新条约签字的日子，应该作为全国人民表示愤怒的日子。告人民书强调指出：日本人民的职责是坚持不懈地进行斗争来反对修改日美“安全条约”，直到阻止批准这个条约为止。告人民书又说：“这样我们将对保卫和平作出贡献”。
    新华社河内23日电　这里的报纸今天报道，越南民主共和国副总理潘继遂在19日回答越南通讯社记者提出的问题时，表示支持日本人民反对岸信介政府和美国政府修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    潘继遂副总理说，岸信介政府同美国政府谈判修改日美“安全条约”，实际上是要进一步加强日美军事联盟，加紧复活日本军国主义，以便为美帝国主义利用日本促使缔结东北亚军事联盟和准备把日本拖入东南亚条约组织铺平道路，也是为了把日本人民推上新的战争道路。
    潘继遂副总理说，在1940年到1945年日本军国主义占领印度支那期间，越南人民曾经遭受了很大的灾难，越南人民深知日本军国主义的复活和它同目前正在破坏越南统一的美帝国主义之间的联盟对越南人民的危害性。
    他说，在反对岸信介政府违反日内瓦协议和不顾越南的实际情况而片面给予南越当局战争赔偿的同时，越南人民强烈反对岸信介政府同美国政府进行关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判。上述两件事情都是违反和平、违反越南和日本两国人民的愿望和利益的。
    潘继遂副总理说，越南人民衷心祝贺日本人民在22日举行的反对修改日美“安全条约”第十次全国统一行动取得重大胜利。他说，日本人民反对修改“安全条约”的斗争正在日益高涨，日本人民的这一正义斗争必将取得最后胜利。
    新华社河内21日电　越南保卫世界和平委员会和越南亚非人民团结委员会20日发表联合声明，支持日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的第十次全国统一行动。
    声明指出，美帝国主义和日本岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”，是为了加强日美两国的军事联盟，加紧恢复日本军国主义，把日本变成美国在远东和亚洲的主要原子战争基地。声明说，修改日美“安全条约”，是对日本的独立和安全以及对亚洲和世界和平的严重威胁。
    声明说，越南保卫世界和平委员会和越南亚非人民团结委员会坚决反对美帝国主义和岸信介政府顽固地要修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。越南人民热烈欢迎和坚决支持日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的广泛、坚决和持续的斗争，并且同日本人民在反对日本片面给予南越以战争赔偿以及反对美帝国主义、岸信介政府和吴庭艳当局互相勾结以准备发动侵略战争的斗争中团结一致。
    声明说，如果美帝国主义和岸信介政府无视日本全国人民的斗争和全世界人民的严厉谴责，而继续走上反对和平的危险道路，它们必将遭到失败。
