　　Warm-Loving Crops Can Withstand the Cold: Siberia Will Be a Sugar Beet Production Area
    People believe that sugar beet is a warm-loving crop, so it can only grow in warm climates. However, the Soviet people have opened up a path for sugar beet to the east.
    The Krasnoyarsk Territory has been included in the sugar beet production area. In the past seven years, three sugar refineries will be built here. At the same time, it is planned to expand the sugar beet planting area to 40,000 to 50,000 hectares. Planting sugar beet will greatly increase the income of collective farms and state farms.
    This year, the Krasnoyarsk Territory planted 10,000 hectares of sugar beet, with an average yield of 130 quintals of sugar beet roots per hectare. The Uzhursky District harvested 213 quintals of sugar beet per hectare on more than 900 hectares of land.
    The sugar content of sugar beet in Siberia is very high. According to information provided by experimental institutions, the sugar content of sugar beet there is between 16% and 20.5%. Practice has convinced people that it is entirely appropriate to use sugar beet grown in Siberia to make sugar.

　　喜暖作物能够不怕寒冷  西伯利亚将是甜菜产区
    人们认为，甜菜是喜暖作物，所以它只能在温暖的气候里生长。但是，苏联人民却给甜菜开辟了通向东部的道路。
    克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区列入了甜菜产区。在最近七年中，将在这里修建三个制糖厂。同时，还打算把甜菜的播种面积扩大到四万至五万公顷。栽种甜菜将大大地增加集体农庄和国营农场的收入。
    今年，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区播种了一万公顷甜菜，平均每公顷收获一百三十公担甜菜根，乌茹尔斯克区九百多公顷土地每公顷收获二百一十三公担甜菜。
    西伯利亚的甜菜含糖量很高。根据试验机关提供的资料，那里甜菜的含糖量是在16％到20.5％之间。实践使人相信，用西伯利亚栽种的甜菜来制糖是完全适宜的。
