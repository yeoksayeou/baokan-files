    Chinese Red Cross Donates Funds
    to Aid Indonesian Refugees
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th December. The Chinese Red Cross today sent a telegram to the Indonesian Red Cross, expressing concern for the Indonesian refugees evacuated from the inland mountainous areas of Sulawesi, and donated RMB 30,000 yuan, requesting the Indonesian Red Cross to purchase urgently needed supplies locally to aid these evacuated refugees.
    In September this year, after the rebel army entrenched in the inland mountainous areas of Sulawesi surrendered to the Indonesian government forces, the people previously under their control moved to coastal cities, totaling more than 600,000 people. These refugees lacked food and clothing in the cities, and the Indonesian Red Cross had appealed to various countries for relief to these refugees through the League of Red Cross Societies.
