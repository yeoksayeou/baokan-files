    A Few Cow Hairs
    Shi Erwu
    A certain intellectual once said: "When the peasants were working individually, they still had a cow. The mutual aid team left them with a cow's backside. When they got to the cooperative, it became a cow's tail, and after communization, only a few cow hairs were left."
    This is a familiar sight: all those who attack cooperativization and the people's communes must put on the airs of representing the peasants, and they all have to describe the new social system and social organization as if it were very cruel to the peasants: not even willing to leave them with "a cow's tail." And they are the ones who are "compassionate" and "concerned about the country and the people."
    Facts often expose their true colors.
    The vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants in China originally had no cows; some lower-middle peasants had only a cow's backside or even just a cow's leg. Where do they get off saying they "lost a cow"? Wealthier middle peasants mostly had a cow, but most of them do not feel that a cow is better than a tractor; they do not feel that the production efficiency of a single person and a single cow is higher than that of a group of people and cows; and they certainly do not feel that individual life struggles are more secure than shared endeavors. Therefore, they have long abandoned the idea of heading towards capitalism alone. Today, those who still have "lost a cow" emotions are only a small number of people who are infatuated with capitalism. That number is only like "a few cow hairs." What they regret is not "a cow," but the disillusionment of their fantasy of being dragged into the capitalist kingdom by this cow. That intellectual, spouting nonsense about what the peasants are thinking, can he represent any kind of peasant?
    To know about rural affairs, you have to ask the majority of the people in the countryside. "You ask us how much grain we can harvest from high-yield land?" "You ask us how many tractors we have?" "You ask us how much land our mechanized wells can irrigate?" "You ask us if our canteens are run well?" "You ask us how many big fat pigs we raise?" "Ours," "ours"... you simply can't estimate how much wealth these people you're talking to actually have. Everything before your eyes, everything you can see and point to, almost nothing is not "ours." What era of peasants has ever had such great wealth? Ever had such a spirit and feeling?
    This is the real great change: from individual farming to mutual aid teams, to cooperatives, to people's communes, the cause is getting bigger and bigger; from no cows, half a cow, or one cow to many cattle and horses, to thousands of "iron oxen" and other agricultural machinery and large farm implements, wealth is getting thicker and thicker; from hunger and cold to "bran and vegetables for half a year's grain," to barely enough to eat and wear, to plenty of food and clothing, life is getting better and better; from worried faces all day long to reduced worries, to relaxed brows, to joyful and encouraging, the mood is getting more and more joyful. This kind of change is entirely the result of the Communist Party leading the vast number of peasants in continuous revolutionary action. Can this be called "cruel"?
    Even some Western reporters have seen that the Chinese countryside after the Great Leap Forward and the communization has become like "a golden dragon." But that intellectual's eyes can't see any of this, but only sees "a few cow hairs." If we compare the private ownership of a small number of individual peasants to an old cow slowly moving towards capitalism on a rugged mountain road, then please tell me: how does this "golden dragon" flying and galloping towards socialism on a broad road compare to your old cow that you are so sadly mourning?
    Why are these people's eyes so bad? To put it bluntly, because they themselves are some of the cow hairs on that old cow heading towards capitalism. According to them, the world should only be like this: an old cow slowly heading towards capitalism. Other than that, everything is bad and unreasonable. This is what is called "chaos" and "terrible." Therefore, they can't see anything except for the "one cow," "cow's backside," and "cow's tail" that they rely on for their existence.
    A few cow hairs, it's still possible to muddle along with a cow's tail, not to mention, they still fantasize about a change from "cow's tail" to "cow's backside" and then to "one cow"? Unexpectedly, with a thunderous crash, even the "cow's tail" is gone; even the remnants of that little bit of private ownership that they depend on for their lives are about to be reduced to nothing. "When the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?" So, the "cow hairs" finally have to come out and wave their claws, trying to block the "golden dragon's" path.
    Wailing is useless, and blocking is even more futile. If you want to survive, you can only move your heels onto the "golden dragon." Let's give these people a limerick:
        Fine scenery, yet lamenting sighs, a few cow hairs with tearful eyes;
        Ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers, can't settle down? Why stubbornly cling to the cow's tail!

    几根牛毛
    施尔武
    有一位知识分子曾说：“农民单干时还有一头牛，互助组留下个牛屁股，到了合作社变成了一个牛尾巴，公社化以后就只剩几根牛毛了。”
    这也是见惯的了：凡是攻击合作化和人民公社的人，都要装出一副农民代表的样子，而且都要把新的社会制度和社会组织说成对农民似乎是很残忍的：连“一个牛尾巴”也不肯留给农民。而他们才是“悲天悯人”又“忧国忧民”的。
    事实常常把他们的真面目揭露出来。
    中国的广大贫雇农原来就没有牛；一些下中农，也不过只有一个牛屁股甚至只是一条牛腿，“丢了一头牛”，他们从何说起？富裕的中农，倒是差不多都有一头牛，但其中的多数，并不觉得牛就比拖拉机好；并不觉得单人单牛的生产效率比群人群牛的生产效率为高，更不觉得独自的生活挣扎比同舟共济更有保障，因此，早已放弃独自走向资本主义的念头了。今天还有“丢了牛”情绪的人，只不过是一小部分对资本主义痴情的人。那数量，不过像“几根牛毛”。他们痛惜的也并不是“一头牛”，而是由这头牛把他们拖向资本主义王国去的幻想的破灭。那位知识分子，乱说什么农民长长短短，他能代表哪种农民？
    要知农村事，就要去问问农村的多数人。“你问俺们那丰产方能打多少粮食？”“你问俺们有多少台拖拉机？”“你问俺们那机井能浇多少地？”“你问俺们那食堂办的好不好？”“你问俺们喂多少大肥猪？”“俺们的”、“俺们的”……你简直估不透同你谈话的这些人到底有多少财富。眼前的一切一切，目所及，手所指，几乎没有一样不是“俺们的”。什么时代的农民有过如此巨富？有过这样的气魄和心情？
    这才是真正的巨变：由单干而互助组，而合作社，而人民公社，事业越来越大；由无牛、半头牛或一头牛而许多牛马，而几千件“铁牛”等等农业机械和大型农具，财富越来越厚；由啼饥号寒而“糠菜半年粮”，而仅得温饱，而丰衣足食，生活越来越好；由终日愁容而减少忧虑，而眉头展放，而欢欣鼓舞，心情越来越欢腾。这种变化，完全是共产党领导广大农民用不断革命的行动取得的。难道这能叫作“残忍”？
    就连西方的一些记者也已看到了，大跃进之后人民公社化了的中国农村，已经变得像是“一条金色巨龙”。而那位知识分子的眼睛，对这一概都看不见，却只看见“几根牛毛”。如果把一小部分个体农民的私有制，比作一条在崎岖山路上向着资本主义缓缓前进的老牛，那末请问：在康庄大道上向社会主义飞舞奔腾的这“金色巨龙”，又比你们悲悼不已的老牛如何呢？
    这些人眼光为什么这样不济？说穿了，因为他们自己正是那头走向资本主义老牛身上的一些牛毛。依他们看来，世界只应该是这样：一头老牛缓缓地走向资本主义。除此以外，一切都是坏的，不合理的。这便是所谓的“乱”和“糟”。所以，除了他们借以存身的“一头牛”、“牛屁股”、“一个牛尾巴”以外，便什么也看不到了。
    几根牛毛嘛，有个牛尾巴是还能混下去的，何况，他们还幻想着会有一个由“牛尾巴”而“牛屁股”再到“一头牛”的变化呢？不想霹雳一声，“牛尾巴”也不见了；连依附为命的那一点小私有制的残余，也要化为乌有了。“皮之不存，毛将焉附？”于是“牛毛”也终于不得不出来张牙舞爪一番，企图拦住“金色巨龙”的去路。
    哀嚎是没有用的，阻拦更是徒然，要想生存，只有把脚跟移到“金色巨龙”身上来才行。得打油诗一首，赠给这些人们吧：
        良辰美景却悲嗟，几根牛毛挂泪花；
        山河万里落不得？何必死钉牛尾巴！
