    Who says loading and unloading can only be done by carrying, pulling, lifting, dragging, and shouldering?
    Cadres of Baoding Loading and Unloading Service Station Cultivate "Experimental Plots"
    Breaking Conservative Thinking, They Made a Large Number of Loading and Unloading Machines
    Leading cadres of the Baoding City Loading and Unloading Service Station in Hebei Province cultivated "experimental plots," promoting the development of the technological innovation movement throughout the station. Currently, heavy manual labor such as carrying, shouldering, pulling, lifting, etc., has been replaced by loading and unloading tools and machinery. The unloading volume of a worker has increased from an average of eight tons per day in the past to more than thirty tons.
    When this service station began to implement the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading operations, some people lacked confidence, believing that loading and unloading was all about carrying, shouldering, pulling, lifting, and dragging, with no technology involved. To complete more tasks, they would need to add more people. The leading cadres of the loading and unloading station, on the one hand, carried out ideological work among the workers, and on the other hand, they worked with the workers to cultivate "experimental plots," first trying to manufacture electric conveyors. They overcame a total of fifteen technical difficulties, and finally succeeded in trial-manufacturing the electric conveyor. Faced with this fact, everyone's confidence greatly increased, and the technological innovation movement throughout the station quickly unfolded. Workers put forward more than 97,000 rationalization proposals, and made 33 types of loading and unloading tools and machinery, totaling more than 8,000 pieces, basically achieving the goal of transporting bulk goods by vehicles, lifting heavy objects with booms, and conveying bulk materials into storage with electric conveyors.

    谁说装卸这一行只能背、拉、抬、拽、扛？
    保定装卸服务站干部种“试验田”
    打破保守思想制成大批装卸机具
    河北省保定市装卸服务站领导干部种“试验田”，推动了全站技术革新运动的开展。目前，全站担、背、扛、拉、抬等笨重体力劳动都已为装卸工具和机械代替，一个工人的装卸量已由过去的平均每天八吨提高到三十多吨。
    这个服务站在开始实行装卸作业机械化半机械化的时候，有些人信心不大，认为装卸这一行，就是背、扛、拉、抬、拽，没有什么技术，要多完成任务，就得添人。装卸站的领导干部一面对工人进行思想工作，一面就同工人一起动手种“试验田”，首先试制电力输送机。他们前后一共克服了十五项技术上的困难，最后将电力输送机试制成功。在这个事实的面前，大家信心大为提高，全站的技术革新运动很快就开展起来。工人们共提出合理化建议九万七千多件，制成三十三种、八千多件装卸工具和机械，基本上做到散装货物都用车子搬运，笨重物品用起重抱杆搬运，散装倒囤入库用电力输送机输送。
