　　Editor's note: Here are some methods of building pigsties for local reference.
　　According to the experience of various places, the following points should be noted when building pigsties:
　　First, in accordance with the principle of diligence and thrift, use local materials and make do with whatever is available, striving to save labor and materials, but also be applicable.
　　Second, pigsties should be warm in winter and cool in summer, facing south from the north, or southeast from the northwest; plant more trees in front and behind the pigsties to avoid the scorching sun and cold winds; the sties should have sufficient light and air circulation.
　　Third, the construction of pigsties must facilitate scientific feeding management, fertilizer transportation, and sanitation and epidemic prevention work. Therefore, before building pigsties, consider the specific issues of pigsty site selection, water source, feed processing, and so on.

　　Pigsty without Wood
　　This kind of pigsty is built entirely of earth, stone, and lime, without a single piece of wood. The side walls are four to five feet high and one to one and a half feet thick, and the central dome is about six to seven feet high. The roof slopes slightly backward to facilitate drainage. When building this kind of pigsty, first use bricks or stones to build the side walls and back wall. The front wall will be built after the dome is completed. The construction method is the same as building an arch bridge. First, build a semi-circular wooden form, and then build it with adobe bricks. Use sand and lime to fill the seams and coat the surface. The ratio of sand and lime is 70% red soil and 15% each of sand and lime. The outside is plastered with lime.
　　This kind of pigsty is six to eight feet long and five feet wide, and can be built in a continuous single-row shape. The ground can be paved with bricks or stones.
　　A "playground" is set up in front of the pigsty. Each pen can raise one sow or four or five large fattening pigs.

　　Octagonal Pigsty
　　This kind of pigsty is thirty feet in diameter, the roof is tiled, the ground is paved with a mixture of soil, sand and lime, and there are windows in all eight directions. A large gate and aisle for pedestrians are set in the middle. The shed is divided into eight pig pens, each pen can raise eight pigs. The advantages are: 1. It saves labor and materials, and can save about 20% of construction costs compared with rectangular pigsties of the same area; 2. It is easy to manage. The breeder can feed and add food and clean up just by standing in the center; 3. There is sufficient light and air circulation. Each pen has a window, and there are skylights above, which are cool in summer and warm in winter; 4. It is easy to accumulate fertilizer. There are urine ditches around the octagon, and there is a hidden ditch leading to the urine pool outside.

　　Bamboo Structure Pigsty
　　One is a simple bamboo structure pigsty, with bamboo woven into walls, and a simple cover on the top. The ground is slightly inclined, and there is a small dung pit on the lower side. The other is a more complex bamboo structure pigsty, built with bamboo into a cottage-like structure, with a small window and door facing south and east. A fence is made of bamboo in front of the pigsty to provide a place for pigs to move around. A manure pit is opened next to the pigsty so that excrement and urine can flow into the pit.

　　Raising Pigs in Caves
　　Use the slope of the mountain to regularly dig caves layer by layer as pigsties. Generally, a cave is dug eight feet deep and four feet wide, which can accommodate two fattening pigs or one sow and a litter of piglets.
　　When raising pigs in caves, pay attention to selecting mountains with a north-south orientation, sticky soil, and a certain slope and convenient transportation; the cave entrance should not be too wide, the area should not be too small, and there should be enough space for activities and sufficient air and sunlight. In order to wash the pigsty and make it convenient to use water, pay attention to choosing a place with water source; it is best to lay bricks or stones in the cave pigsty to avoid dampness; a ditch should be opened in the middle of the cave bottom to allow pig urine to flow into the urine pool. The advantages are: warm in winter and cool in summer; saving labor and materials; pigsties are isolated, which is conducive to hygiene and epidemic prevention. (Attached picture)

　　因地制宜勤俭建猪场
    编者按：　这里介绍几种修建猪舍的方法，供各地参考。
    按照各地经验，修建猪舍需要注意以下几点：
    第一，根据勤俭原则，就地取材、因陋就简，力求省工、省料，但又适用。
    第二，猪舍要做到冬暖夏凉，座北朝南，或座西北朝东南；猪舍前后要多种树木，以避烈日和寒风；舍内光线充足，空气流通。
    第三，猪舍的建筑一定要便于科学饲养管理、运送肥料和卫生防疫工作。因此修建猪舍之前，要考虑到猪舍场地的选择、水的来源、饲养加工等等具体问题。
　　无木料猪舍
    这种猪舍全部用土、石和石灰建成，不用一根木料。两边墙高四至五尺，厚一尺至一尺半，中央圆顶约高六至七尺，屋顶向后方倾斜一些，以利排去雨水。盖这种猪舍时，先用砖或块石砌建边墙和后墙，前墙要等到圆顶建成后才建，盖法如建拱形桥一样，先搭半圆形木模，在上面用土砖砌成，用沙灰涂缝和涂面，沙灰比例为赤土七成，沙和石灰各一成半，外面用石灰粉面。
    这种猪舍全长六至八尺，宽五尺，可以连续排列建成单列式形状。地面用砖砌、石铺均可。
    猪舍前面设“运动场”，每栏可养母猪一头或大菜猪四、五头。
　　八角形猪舍
    这种猪舍直径三十尺，屋顶铺瓦，地面铺砌三合土，八个方向都有窗户，中部设人行大门和走道。舍内分作八个猪栏，每栏可养猪八头。优点是：一、省工省料，比同等面积的长方形猪舍能节省建筑费20％左右；二、管理方便，饲养员只要站在中央就可喂料添食，打扫清洁；三、光线充足，空气流通，各栏都有一个窗户，上面还有天窗，夏凉冬暖；四、便于积肥，八角周围有尿沟，并有一条阴沟通到外面尿池。
　　竹结构猪舍
    一种是简单的竹结构猪舍，用竹子编成围墙，上面一半搭一个简单的盖，地面稍为倾斜，在低的一边有一个小粪坑。另一种是比较复杂的竹结构猪舍，用竹子搭成一个像小屋子样子，向南面和东面开个小窗和门，在猪舍的前面用竹子做个栅栏，以便猪有活动场所，在猪舍的旁边开个粪坑，以便屎尿流进坑内。
    山洞养猪
　　利用山的坡度有规则地层层挖洞做猪舍，一般的山洞深挖八尺、宽四尺，可容纳两只菜猪或一只母猪一窝小猪。
    山洞养猪应注意选择座北朝南、土质粘实，同时要有一定坡度、交通方便的山地；洞口不能太宽，面积不能太小，并要有足够的运动场所和充足的空气和阳光。为了洗涤猪舍，用水方便，要注意选择有水源的地方；在山洞猪舍内，最好要铺砖头或石块，以免潮湿；洞底中间应开条沟，使猪尿流入尿池。好处是：冬暖夏凉；省工省料；猪舍隔离，有利卫生和防疫。（附图片）
