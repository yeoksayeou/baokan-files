　　Philippine Textile Factory Association Decides to Take Measures
    To Develop Cotton Planting Industry Independently, Not Relying on Imported American Cotton
    According to Philippine newspapers, the Philippine Textile Factory Association decided on the 12th to mobilize its own resources to establish a cotton planting industry in the Philippines, in order to change the situation of relying on American surplus cotton.
    It is reported that Miguel Cuaderno, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, has assured the government's support for this undertaking, guaranteeing full financial assistance through loans from the Development Bank of the Philippines.
    Philippine textile factories import US$40 million worth of raw cotton from the United States annually on a peso-denominated payment basis. However, since the Philippines levied a 25% exchange surcharge in July of this year, it has stopped purchasing American surplus cotton. This is because the United States insisted that the Philippines pay at a rate of 2.5 pesos to 1 US dollar (the official rate is 2 to 1), which the Philippines refused to accept, arguing that surplus cotton is not traded in foreign exchange and therefore should not be subject to a surcharge.

　　菲律宾纺织工厂协会决定采取措施
    不靠进口美棉　自办植棉事业
    据菲律宾报纸报道，菲律宾纺织工厂协会在12日决定动员自己的资源在菲律宾兴办植棉事业，以便改变依靠美国剩余原棉的情况。
    据报道，菲律宾中央银行行长米格尔·卡德诺已经保证政府支持这个事业，保证要通过菲律宾开发银行的贷款给予充分的财政援助。
    菲律宾的纺织工厂每年在以比索付款的基础上从美国进口价值达四千万美元的原棉。但是，自从菲律宾在今年7月对外汇征收25％的贴水以后，便停止购买美国的剩余原棉。因为美国坚持要菲律宾按二点五比索比一美元的比价付款（官价是二比一），而菲律宾拒绝接受这个条件，理由是：剩余棉花并不是以外汇进行交易的，因此不应考虑贴水的问题。　（新华社）
