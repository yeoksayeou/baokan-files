Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The textile industry system recently summarized two advanced experiences: the fine yarn doffing working method and the warp drawing working method. This was achieved by the Ministry of Textile Industry, the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Textile Industry, and the Beijing Municipal Textile Trade Union in mid-November, through inviting advanced fine yarn doffing producers and some advanced warp drawing producers from various regions who participated in the National "Heroes' Conference," as well as fine yarn doffing experts and warp drawing experts from Beijing, to conduct demonstrations, measurements, analyses, and research in Beijing.

The main task of a doffing worker is to remove the full bobbins and insert empty ones. The entire doffing work consists of four actions: grabbing the bobbin, pulling out the yarn, flicking the yarn, and inserting the bobbin. These actions are repeated four to five thousand times a day. If these actions can be performed quickly and well, the doffing efficiency can be greatly improved. The new doffing working method, based on the basic requirements of shortening doffing time and reducing yarn breakage during doffing, focuses on summarizing the experience of "four-crossings, three-coordinations, and no empty spindles," that is, the four actions of grabbing the bobbin, pulling out the yarn, flicking the yarn, and inserting the bobbin are rationally organized, crossed and combined, and carried out continuously; hands cooperate, hands and feet cooperate, and hands and eyes cooperate; pull out one bobbin and immediately insert one bobbin. This changes the previous phenomenon of uncoordinated actions and wasted time due to empty spindles, thereby shortening the doffing time and reducing breakage. Since doffing work is a collective operation in the form of a work team, the new working method also summarizes the experience of the doffing team in making careful plans for doffing work and unifying dispatching and commanding to ensure that the work organization of the entire doffing group is close and the actions are unified.

The basic characteristics of the warp drawing working method are: rational organization of labor, reduction of repetitive actions, light, fast, steady, and accurate basic movements, and everything is for the purpose of avoiding defects and improving labor productivity. Currently, general warp drawing involves using two hooks to draw two warp yarns at a time. This time, the experience of Zhang Ruiying and Zhou Fuying in drawing four warp yarns at a time with four hooks was summarized. Four warp yarns can be drawn at a time, thus greatly increasing output. The basic actions of a warp drawing worker are drawing heddle wires, drawing drop wires, drawing warp yarns, and inserting reeds. These actions are very small and precise. Therefore, the new working method specifically summarizes the experience of coordinating the use of eyesight and hands and feet to ensure lightness, speed, steadiness, and accuracy, avoid mis-drawing and breaking warp yarns, thereby increasing output and improving quality. The new working method also summarizes the experience of reed workers inspecting while drawing reeds during the warp drawing process. If defects are dealt with in a timely manner, greater waste of time can be avoided.

These two methods can not only increase output and quality but also improve labor productivity, meeting the comprehensive requirements of being more, faster, better, and more economical. According to actual measurements, the doffing working method can reduce the doffing downtime from the current general forty seconds to about twenty seconds, and can achieve basically no breakage during doffing; the warp drawing working method can increase output by about 30%, and can achieve no mis-drawing, greatly improving product quality.

    把全国细纱落纱和穿经能手的创造汇集成系统经验
    纺织部门总结出两项先进工作法
    据新华社讯　纺织工业系统最近总结出两项先进经验：细纱落纱工作法和穿经工作法。这是纺织工业部、纺织工会全国委员会、北京市纺织工业局和北京市纺织工会在11月中旬，通过邀请参加全国“群英会”的各地细纱落纱先进生产者和部分穿经先进生产者，以及北京市的细纱落纱能手、穿经能手，在北京进行了表演、测定、分析、研究以后，总结出来的。
    落纱工的主要工作是把纺满的纱管拔去，插上空管。整个落纱工作是由抓管、拔纱、甩纱和插管四个动作组成的，每天要重复四、五千次以上，如果能把这些动作作得快作得好，就可以大大提高落纱效率。新的落纱工作法根据缩短落纱时间和降低落纱断头的基本要求，着重总结了四交叉、三配合、不空锭的经验，即抓管、拔纱、甩纱和插管四个动作合理组织、交叉结合，连贯进行；双手配合、手脚配合、手眼配合；拔一个纱紧接着插一个管。这就改变了过去几个动作不连贯、空锭等浪费时间的现象，从而缩短了落纱时间，减少了断头。由于落纱工作是工作队形式的集体性操作，新的工作法还总结了落纱长周密计划落纱工作，统一调度和指挥的经验，保证整个落纱组的工作组织紧密，行动统一。
    穿经工作法的基本特点是：合理组织劳动，减少重复动作，基本动作轻、快、稳、准，一切为了不出疵点和提高劳动生产率。现在一般的穿经都是用二根钩一次穿二根经纱，这次总结了章瑞英、周福英四根钩一次引穿的经验，一次可以引穿四根经纱，因此大大提高了产量。穿经工的基本动作是穿综丝、穿停经片、穿经纱、插筘，这些动作都很细小精密。因此，新工作法中特别总结了目光和手脚配合运用的经验，保证作到轻、快、稳、准，避免穿错和拉断经纱，从而增加产量和提高质量。新工作法同时还总结了穿筘工人在穿经过程中，边穿边检查的经验。有了疵点及时处理，就可避免造成时间上更大的浪费。
    这两个作法既能提高产量、质量，又能提高劳动生产率，符合多快好省的全面要求。据实际测定，落纱工作法可以使落纱停车时间从目前一般的四十秒钟降低到二十秒左右，并且可以作到落纱基本上不断头；穿经工作法可以提高产量30％左右，并且可以作到一根不穿错，大大提高产品质量。
