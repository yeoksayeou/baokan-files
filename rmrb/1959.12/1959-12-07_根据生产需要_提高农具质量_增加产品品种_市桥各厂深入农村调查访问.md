Guangzhou, December 6th (report from our newspaper) – In order to further implement the policy of industry serving agriculture, factories in Shiqiao Town, Panyu County, Guangdong Province, have recently sent people to rural areas to solicit farmers' opinions on industrial production and understand their needs, so as to better serve agricultural production.

Shiqiao Town has more than 20 factories, including General Machinery Factory and Agricultural Machinery Factory, which can produce diesel engines, cultivators, rural transportation vehicles, and various agricultural tools, making it the county's agricultural tool production base. Recently, in order to better support agricultural production, the town organized a visiting group of 48 leading cadres from 22 factories in the town, headed by the secretary of the town Party committee, to conduct investigations and visits in Shawan Commune and Shatou Commune. They adopted methods such as helping farmers with labor, chatting with farmers, holding forums, conducting individual interviews, and on-site inspections of tool usage, to widely solicit farmers' opinions and understand their needs. Rural grassroots cadres and the broad masses of farmers warmly welcomed the approach of the leading cadres of Shiqiao Town. They seriously put forward improvement opinions on the variety, quality, and quantity of many industrial products. For example, for ox carts and harvesters, which only began to be promoted this year, while affirming the benefits of these tools, farmers also put forward improvement opinions on the specifications and quality of ox carts; they believe that the car boxes are small, the axles are thin, and the car wheels are prone to bursting and breaking, making them not durable. Farmers also requested an increase in the variety of certain products to suit the needs of different regions. For example, the winter plows only have one plow tip, which is suitable for sandy fields but not suitable for clay areas. In addition, they also criticized the tool departments for being out of touch with reality. For example, grain baskets are woven too sparsely, making it easy to leak grain, and the straw raincoats are too small to keep out the rain. The urgently needed ox carts and plowshares are requested by various communes to be supplied in large quantities by the industrial departments, and they also hope to test-produce rice transplanters for them.

This time, the cadres of the factories were greatly inspired by the investigation and visits in the countryside. After returning to the factory, they immediately studied the farmers' opinions and discussed improvement measures. Then, the factories universally convened employee meetings to convey the opinions of the peasant brothers to the employees. Since then, significant improvements have been made in the quality and variety of agricultural tools in each factory. For example, the employees of Shiqiao Town Bamboo Factory strictly checked the quality, ensuring that defective products do not leave the factory. The employees of Shiqiao Town Wood Factory accepted the farmers' opinions, tried every means to explore raw materials, improved the quality of ox carts, and increased the variety of plowshares.

In order to vigorously support rural winter production and water conservancy construction, many factories have formulated plans to support agricultural production. The town plans to manufacture 1,500 ox carts, 10,000 sickles, 61,000 pairs of mud chisels, and 28,400 grain baskets before the end of the year. After undertaking the production tasks of 108 sets of sluice gates for the construction of sluices in various communes and more than 200 sweet potato seedling machines, the employees of the General Machinery Factory are working day and night to deliver the goods in the shortest possible time to meet the needs of large-scale water conservancy and sweet potato processing after a bumper harvest.

    根据生产需要  提高农具质量  增加产品品种
    市桥各厂深入农村调查访问
    本报广州6日电　广东省番禺县市桥镇各工厂为了进一步贯彻工业为农业服务的方针，最近纷纷派人深入农村，征求农民对工业生产的意见和了解他们的需要，以便更好地为农业生产服务。
    市桥镇有通用机械厂、农业机械厂等二十多个工厂，能生产柴油机、耕耘机、以及农村运输工具和各式农具，是全县的农具生产基地。最近，这个镇为了更好地支援农业生产，以中共镇委书记为首组织了全镇二十二个工厂的四十八个领导干部的访问团，分别深入到沙湾公社和沙头公社进行调查访问。他们采取一边帮助农民劳动，一边和农民漫谈，或召开座谈会、个别访问、现场考察工具使用情况等方式，广泛征求农民的意见，并了解他们的需要。农村基层干部和广大农民对市桥镇领导干部这样的做法表示热烈欢迎。他们都很认真地对许多工业产品的品种、质量和数量提出了改进意见。如今年才开始推广的牛马车和收刈器，农民们在肯定这些工具的好处的同时，也对牛马车的规格、质量提出了改进的意见；认为车箱小、车轴细、车轩容易暴裂折断不耐用。农民还要求增加某些产品的品种，以适应不同地区的需要。如冬耕犁只有一个犁尖，适合沙田地区，对粘土地区不适用。此外，他们还对工具部门脱离实际的现象提出了批评。如谷箩织得太疏，容易漏谷，蓑衣太小，遮不住雨水。当前生产急需的牛马车、犁头等，各公社都要求工业部门大量供应，并希望为他们试制播秧机。
    这次下乡调查访问，各工厂干部受到很大启发。回到工厂后，立即研究了农民的意见，同时还讨论了改进措施。接着各工厂普遍召开了职工大会，把农民兄弟的意见向职工们作了传达。此后，各厂在农具质量和品种方面有了显著提高。如市桥镇竹厂职工严格检查质量，做到了废品不出门。市桥镇木厂职工接受农民的意见，千方百计挖掘原料材料，提高了牛马车的质量，还增加了犁头的品种。
    为了大力支援农村冬季生产和兴修水利运动，许多工厂都制定了支援农业生产的规划。全镇计划在年底前制造牛马车一千五百辆、镰刀一万件、坭篸六万一千对，谷箩二万八千四百只。通用机器厂职工承接了各公社修建水闸用的水闸门一百零八套和二百多部薯苗机的生产任务后，日夜赶工，争取在最短时间交货，以满足大兴水利和番薯丰收后加工的需要。
