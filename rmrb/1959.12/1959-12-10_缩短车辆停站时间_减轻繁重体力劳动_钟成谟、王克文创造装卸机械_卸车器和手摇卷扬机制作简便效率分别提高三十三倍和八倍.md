According to the *Luda Daily* news: Zhong Chengmo and Wang Kewen, two ordinary moving workers in the Material Handling Section of the Dalian Hoisting Machine Factory, with the support of the Party, have successively created various loading and unloading machines such as unloaders and hand-crank winch loaders, greatly improving the efficiency of unloading and loading vehicles. The efficiency of the hand-crank loader and the unloader has increased by eight and thirty-three times respectively compared to manual loading and unloading, and it is very safe.

The common characteristics of the unloader and hand-crank winch loader created by Zhong Chengmo and Wang Kewen are: they conform to scientific principles, are simple to manufacture, have a light body, cost very little to manufacture, have significant effects, and ensure safety. To manufacture an unloader, only four pieces of old angle iron and ten round iron balls are used as materials; the structure is to put two pieces of angle iron together, and put five round iron balls in the middle. This seemingly simple tool, due to the use of the "inertia" principle, can unload a carload of steel at once. Before using this tool, when unloading round steel, angle iron, channel steel, and steel rails, workers needed to carry them down one by one, which was very laborious, inefficient, and not safe enough. Using this machine to unload steel is very simple. Before loading, put the unloader in the carriage, load the steel on the unloader, and when you arrive at the unloading location, open the carriage and gently pry one end of the unloader with a crowbar. As the round iron balls in the unloader slide, the carload of steel slides off the car. In the past, it took four people fifty minutes to unload a carload of steel manually, but with this machine, it only takes two people three minutes to complete the unloading. The hand-crank winch loader they created is a machine suitable for loading and unloading large steel ingots, round steel, dies, etc. In the past, to load large round iron weighing more than 300 kilograms, four people were needed to lift it from the ground and send it to the shoulders of another four people to carry it into the carriage; if loading and unloading large steel ingots weighing three or four hundred kilograms, because people could not carry them, modern machinery such as universal loaders or cranes were needed for loading and unloading. Now, using a hand-crank winch loader composed of a vertical pole, a support pole, a pulley, and a steel wire rope for loading and unloading, it is much easier. Just use a steel wire rope to tie up the thick steel, and one person can lift half a ton to a ton of steel onto the car. Because this machine is very light and portable, it can be installed on the car and carried wherever you go.

Zhong Chengmo and Wang Kewen are both old workers with a low level of education. The heavy moving work made them have the idea of ​​quickly changing the current work situation. Whenever they went to carry the heavy steel, they would even think that the workers in the production workshop were finding tricks to make innovations, so why couldn't we get a machine to replace people to do the work? At this time, a wave of technological innovation and large-scale development of indigenous equipment appeared in the factory, and the vigorous mass movement prompted them to open their minds. Zhong Chengmo quickly designed the drawings of the hand-crank winch loader. After the Party branch in the section learned about this, it gave enthusiastic encouragement and active support. As a result, they created the hand-crank winch loader in just over twenty days. After this creation was realized, it further encouraged their enthusiasm. Because the hand-crank winch loader is only suitable for loading and unloading heavy and short materials, and long steel cannot be loaded and unloaded, Wang Kewen designed the "unloader", and after several revisions by the two, it was quickly manufactured successfully.

Zhong Chengmo's enthusiasm for innovation is getting bigger and bigger. He is now researching a machine for unloading bulk materials such as coal, sand, and stones, so that loading and unloading of more kinds of materials can be replaced by machines instead of manpower. (Attached picture)

### 缩短车辆停站时间　减轻繁重体力劳动  钟成谟、王克文创造装卸机械  卸车器和手摇卷扬机制作简便效率分别提高三十三倍和八倍

    缩短车辆停站时间　减轻繁重体力劳动
    钟成谟、王克文创造装卸机械
    卸车器和手摇卷扬机制作简便效率分别提高三十三倍和八倍
    据旅大日报消息　大连起重机器厂搬运科搬运工人钟成谟和王克文两位普通工人，在党的支持下，连续创造成功了卸车器、手摇卷扬装卸机等多种装卸机具，大大提高了卸车装车效率。手摇装卸机和卸车器的效率比人工装卸分别提高了八倍和三十三倍，并且十分安全。
    钟成谟、王克文创造的卸车器和手摇卷扬装卸机的共同特点是：合乎科学原理，制造简便，机体轻便，制造费用很少，效果显著，保证安全。制造一副卸车器，只用四根废旧的角铁和十个圆铁球作材料；构造是，把两块角铁对在一起，中间放上五个元铁球就成。这种看来十分简陋的工具，由于采用了
  “惯性”原理，可以把成车的钢材一下子卸下来。没采用这种工具之前，卸元钢、角铁、槽钢、钢轨时，需要工人一根一根往下扛，很费力，效率也很低，也不够安全。用这个机具卸钢材就简单得很，装车前把卸车器放在车厢里，把钢材装在卸车器上面，到了卸车地点，把车厢打开，用撬杠在卸车器的一端轻轻一撬，随着卸车器里圆铁球的滑动，成车的钢材就被滑下车来。过去用人工卸一车钢材，四个人得五十分钟，用这种机具只要两个人三分钟即可卸完。他们创造的手摇卷扬装卸机，是一种适合于装卸大型钢锭、元钢、胎具等的机具。过去装三百公斤以上的大元铁，需要四个人从平地抓起来送到另外四个人的肩上，扛到车厢里；要是装卸三四百公斤重的大钢锭，因为人没法扛，必须有万能装卸机或吊车等现代化机械来装卸。现在用由一根立杆、一根支杆、一个滑轮、一条钢丝绳组成的手摇卷扬装卸机来装卸，这就省劲得多了，只要用钢丝绳把粗大的钢材捆住，一个人就可以把半吨和一吨重的钢材吊上汽车。因为这种机具很轻便，可以安在汽车上，走到哪里带到哪里。
    钟成谟和王克文，都是文化程度很低的老工人。繁重的搬运工作，使得他们产生了要求迅速改变工作现状的念头。每当他们去扛那笨重的钢材时，就连想到生产车间的工人都找窍门闹革新，咱们就不能弄个机器代替人来干活？这时，工厂里出现了技术革新、大搞土设备的热潮，轰轰烈烈的群众运动促使他们大开脑筋，钟成谟很快就设计出手摇卷扬装卸机的图样。科里党支部知道这事后，给予热情的鼓励和积极的支持。结果，他们只用短短的二十几天就创造成功了手摇卷扬装卸机。这项创造实现后，更加鼓舞了他们的干劲。因为手摇卷扬装卸机只适用于装卸重而短的物资，长根的钢材没法装卸，王克文又设计了“卸车器”，经过两人几次修改，也很快地制造成功。
    钟成谟的革新劲头越来越大，现在正在研究一种卸煤、砂、石头等散装物资的机具，以便让更多种物资的装卸能够用机器代替人力。（附图片）
