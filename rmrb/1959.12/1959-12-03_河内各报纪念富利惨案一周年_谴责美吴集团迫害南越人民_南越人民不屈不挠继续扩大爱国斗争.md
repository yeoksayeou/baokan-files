Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 1st: Hanoi newspapers today commemorated the anniversary of the Phu Loi concentration camp massacre where the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique poisoned over a thousand patriots. Editorials, commentaries, and articles were published in various newspapers, strongly condemning this atrocity committed by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique and their continued brutal persecution of South Vietnamese patriotic people over the past year.

The editorial published by "People's Daily" pointed out that "The South Vietnamese people, with a high spirit of patriotism and rich experience in revolutionary struggle, will certainly unite, persist in, and expand the struggle against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, to protect their lives and property, fight for the right to live, fight for democracy and freedom, and realize national independence and the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The people of North Vietnam, who are of the same flesh and blood as the South Vietnamese people, are determined to further vigorously promote socialist construction in the North and the struggle to realize the reunification of the motherland."

An article published in "People's Daily" today pointed out that in North Vietnam, since the Phu Loi massacre, a total of 3.5 million people have participated in demonstrations, and 800 people's delegations have submitted 70,000 letters of protest with 4.5 million signatures to the International Commission. The people of North Vietnam are also transforming their grief into strength and accelerating socialist construction with practical actions.

"New Era Newspaper" and "People's Army Daily" also published editorials and commentaries today, strongly condemning the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in persecuting the South Vietnamese people.

Hanoi newspapers reported today that the Central Committee for Opposition to the Phu Loi Massacre and Opposition to the Persecution and Massacre Crimes of the South Vietnamese Authorities issued a statement on November 29, condemning the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique for continuing to carry out "sweeps" and promulgating the 1959 Ordinance No. 10 and the "Policy on Former Resistance Personnel," further persecuting patriotic people after the Phu Loi massacre.

The statement said that now, more than ever, it is imperative for the International Commission to investigate the situation of the Phu Loi massacre on the spot and take timely and appropriate measures to stop the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's murderous crimes.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 1st: Newspapers here reported today that since the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique brutally murdered thousands of patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp on December 1, 1958, the South Vietnamese people's struggle against persecution has been rising day by day.

According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of 1959 alone, some provinces in the western region of the South had 45,800 people carrying out 2,134 struggles, some of which were attended by thousands of people. After receiving news of the Phu Loi massacre, people in many places held "National Mourning Weeks." In various places, even in Saigon and Cholon, the centers of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's rule, leaflets, slogans, and propaganda paintings exposing the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique appeared.

At the same time, in the rural areas of South Vietnam, the peasants' struggle to defend their land interests was also very fierce. In the first half of this year alone, in some provinces in the western region of the South, peasants carried out 1,341 struggles.
