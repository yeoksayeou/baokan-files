To meet the needs of large-scale pig raising, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, recently adopted a method combining leading cadres, technicians, and the masses to identify each pig and select and retain 31,400 young sows with strong bodies, good development, and suitable for breeding. This has increased the number of breeding sows in the county from nearly 30,000 to over 61,000, doubling the number.

The method of selecting young sows is as follows: First, the collective livestock farms make their own reports. Then, the commune party committee organizes livestock cadres, veterinarians, castration personnel, and experienced pig-raising commune members to inspect each pen and identify each pig in the farms. All young sows suitable for breeding are registered, and attention is paid to strengthening feeding management.

　　逐头鉴定　选留小母猪
    浙江黄岩县为了适应大量养猪的需要，最近采取领导干部、技术员和群众三结合的办法，逐头鉴定，选留了身体健壮、发育良好、适合繁殖的小母猪三万一千四百多头，这样全县可配种的母猪即从近三万头猛增到六万一千多头，翻了一番。
    挑选小母猪的办法是：先由集体畜牧场自报，然后由公社党委组织畜牧干部、兽医、阉割手和有养猪经验的社员，到牧场逐栏检查，逐头鉴定，把适宜于繁殖的小母猪全部加以登记，同时注意加强饲养管理。
