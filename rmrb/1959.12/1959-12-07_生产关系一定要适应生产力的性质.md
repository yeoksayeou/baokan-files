Aphorisms

No social order ever disappears before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have been developed; and new, higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself.
Marx: "Preface to a Critique of Political Economy"

The new relations of production are a major and decisive force which actually determines the further, and powerful, development of the productive forces; without these new relations of production, the productive forces are doomed to languish, as is the case in capitalist countries today.
Stalin: "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR"

Socialist relations of production have been established, and they are adapted to the development of the productive forces; however, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are contradictory to the development of the productive forces.
Mao Zedong: "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People"

...Small cooperatives have few people, little land, and little capital, making it impossible to carry out large-scale operations and use machinery. This kind of small cooperative still restricts the development of the productive forces and cannot remain for too long. It should be gradually merged.
Mao Zedong: Note to "The Superiority of Large Cooperatives" in "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"

After socialist relations of production and the superstructure adapted to this relation of production, i.e., the economic base, are established, they are still in a process of continuous development and continuous improvement and cannot be fixed. In order to adapt to the requirements of the continued forward development of the productive forces, all aspects of the relations of production need to be adjusted at any time, and accordingly, all aspects of the superstructure built on this economic base also need to be innovated at any time. Between the productive forces and the relations of production, and between the economic base and the superstructure, contradictions constantly arise and are overcome, overcome and arise again. This is a ceaseless, ever-new dialectical process.
Zhou Enlai: "The Great Decade"

    生产关系一定要适应生产力的性质
    语录
    无论哪一个社会形态，当它所给以充分发展余地的那一切生产力还没有展开以前，是决不会灭亡的；而新的更高的生产关系，当它所借以存在的那些物质条件还没有在旧社会胞胎里成熟以前，是决不会出现的。
    马克思：“政治经济学批判序言”
    新生产关系是这样一种主要的和有决定性的力量，它真正决定生产力进一步的而且是强大的发展，没有这种新的生产关系，生产力就注定要萎靡下去，如像现在资本主义国家中的情形一样。
    斯大林：“苏联社会主义经济问题”
    社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是相矛盾的。
    毛泽东：“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”
    ……小社人少地少资金少，不能进行大规模的经营，不能使用机器。这种小社仍然束缚生产力的发展，不能停留太久，应当逐步合并。
    毛泽东：“中国农村的社会主义高潮”“大社的优越性”一文的按语
    社会主义生产关系和适应于这种生产关系即经济基础的上层建筑在建立起来以后，还是处在不断发展和不断完善的过程中，不能是固定不变的。为着适应生产力继续向前发展的要求，生产关系的各个方面随时需要进行调整，随之，建立在这种经济基础上的上层建筑的各个方面也随时需要革新。在生产力和生产关系之间，在经济基础和上层建筑之间，矛盾不断地产生而又克服，克服而又产生，这是一个川流不息、万古常新的辩证法的过程。
    周恩来：“伟大的十年”
