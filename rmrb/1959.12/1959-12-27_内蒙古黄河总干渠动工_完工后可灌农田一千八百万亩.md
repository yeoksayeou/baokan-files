Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 26th: Winter construction of the Yellow River Main Canal in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a high tide. On the 68-kilometer-long construction site, laborers of various ethnic groups are fighting against the frozen earth in the severe cold of minus 17 or 18 degrees Celsius. By the beginning of December, they had excavated 4.62 million cubic meters of earth, completing 61% of the original task.

Based on past winter construction experience, the laborers on the Main Canal construction site have created more than a dozen advanced construction methods, such as frozen block road padding, soil turning for insulation, side insulation, and mud insulation. These methods have been adapted to local conditions and applied in various sections. They have also used local materials to create and promote tools such as crowbar lifting of frozen blocks and tripod lifting baskets, overcoming the difficulties brought about by mud and frozen soil, and saving a lot of labor and baskets. With the strong support of the People's Communes, many sections have solved the problems of material supply for reforming frozen soil tools and making frost-breaking tools. At present, the tool reform and high work efficiency movement are continuing to unfold on the construction site.

The Yellow River Main Canal is 350 kilometers long. After its complete excavation, it can irrigate 18 million mu of farmland from Sanshenggong in the west to the east of Baotou. These irrigation areas will become the first areas in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification.

　　内蒙古黄河总干渠动工
    完工后可灌农田一千八百万亩
    新华社呼和浩特26日电　内蒙古自治区黄河总干渠冬季施工进入高潮。在长达六十八公里的工地上，各族民工冒着零下十七八度的严寒，向坚冰冻土展开了斗争。到12月上旬，他们已开挖土方四百六十二万立方米，完成原定任务的61％。
    根据往年冬季施工经验，总干渠工地的民工们创造了冻块垫路、翻土保温、侧面保温、泥水保温等十几种先进施工方法。这些方法在各工段得到因地制宜的采用。他们还就地取材，创造推广了?芁抬冻块、三角架抬筐等工具，战胜泥水和冻土带来的困难，节省了大量劳动力和箩筐。许多工段在人民公社的大力支援下，解决了改革冻土工具、制做破冻工具的材料供应等问题。目前，工具改革和高工效运动还在工地上继续展开。
    黄河总干渠共长三百五十公里，全部开挖成功后，可灌溉西起三盛公东至包头以东的农田一千八百万亩。这些灌区将成为内蒙古自治区首先实现农业机械化、电气化的地区。
