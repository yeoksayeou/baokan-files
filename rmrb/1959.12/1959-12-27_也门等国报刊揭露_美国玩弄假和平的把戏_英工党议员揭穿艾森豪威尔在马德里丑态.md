Xinhua News Agency, Taiz, December 25th: The latest issue of the Yemeni Arabic weekly "Al-Ra'id" published a commentary stating, "It is ridiculous that while U.S. President Eisenhower is visiting some Asian countries, calling for peace and easing international tensions, the U.S. delegation to the United Nations is opposing Algeria's attainment of freedom and peace."

The commentary said, "It is not surprising that the imperialist bloc led by the United States opposes the Algerian issue, because we know that the United States supports France because it harbors ambitions to participate in the plundering of Algerian resources."

The commentary pointed out that the Arab people recognize the imperialist ambitions of the United States because the United States once sent its Sixth Fleet to help the reactionary forces in Jordan overthrow the Nabulsi cabinet, and during the Iraqi revolution, U.S. troops landed in Lebanon in an attempt to block the tide of Arab people striving for freedom.

The commentary concluded that no matter what conspiracies the imperialists engage in, the Algerian people will surely achieve their independence and peace.

Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: The British "Daily Herald" commented on Eisenhower's foreign trip on the 22nd, discussing the hypocrisy of his "peace" slogan. The newspaper published an article by its New York correspondent Sampson, pointing out that while Eisenhower "endangered his health to conduct this arduous 'peace crusade'," some people in the United States have been "welcoming the restoration of the Cold War."

New York State Governor Rockefeller "has boldly expressed skepticism about negotiating with Moscow," and "he has likely sensed what the mood of the Republican Party will be next year." U.S. intelligence chief Allen Dulles also stated a few days ago that "the United States must maintain nuclear forces to deal with the challenge of communism."

The reporter said, "These words have aroused enthusiastic responses among the military-industrial complex and those who believe that any move towards disarmament might harm the entire prosperity of the United States."

The reporter believes that such results make people doubt the "hypocrisy of the international goals" announced by the Eisenhower government.

Xinhua News Agency, London, December 24th: British Labor MP Robert Edwards, who returned to London by plane from Madrid today, told reporters that the "welcome" received by Eisenhower during his visit to Madrid was a "clumsy circus."

Edwards witnessed the "welcome" scene in Madrid. He said, "Most Spaniards are gloomy and depressed; only a few pre-selected people were cheering," "At that time, machine guns erected on the top of every building were aiming at the crowd."

Edwards emphasized that it was the United States that "maintained the Franco regime with dollars." He said, "Franco and his government would not be able to last five minutes without dollar aid."

Edwards went to Madrid to observe the Franco regime's trial of a group of Spanish democrats. However, he was arrested by the Franco regime and deported.

　　也门等国报刊揭露
    美国玩弄假和平的把戏
    英工党议员揭穿艾森豪威尔在马德里丑态
    新华社塔兹25日电　最近一期的也门阿拉伯文“先锋”周刊发表评论说，“可笑的是，就在美国总统艾森豪威尔访问一些亚洲国家，呼吁和平和缓和国际紧张局势的同时，美国在联合国的代表团却反对阿尔及利亚获得自由和和平”。
    评论说，“以美国为首的帝国主义集团反对阿尔及利亚问题是不足为奇的，因为我们知道，美国支持法国是由于它抱有参与掠夺阿尔及利亚资源的野心”。
    评论指出，阿拉伯人民认识美国的帝国主义野心，因为美国曾经派遣它的第六舰队帮助约旦的反动派颠覆了纳布西内阁，在伊拉克革命的时候，美国军队曾在黎巴嫩登陆企图阻挡阿拉伯人民争取自由的浪潮。
    评论最后说，不论帝国主义者搞什么阴谋诡计，阿尔及利亚人民必将获得他们的独立和和平。
    新华社25日讯　英国“每日先驱报”22日在评论艾森豪威尔国外旅行时，谈到他的“和平”口号的虚伪性。这家报纸发表它的驻纽约记者桑普森写的一篇文章指出，当艾森豪威尔“不惜他的健康而进行了这次费力的‘和平十字军’访问”时，美国的某些人一直在“欢迎恢复冷战”。
    纽约州州长洛克菲勒“已经大胆地对同莫斯科谈判表示怀疑”，“他很可能已经感觉到了共和党明年的心情将是怎样的”。美国情报局头子艾伦·杜勒斯在几天前也表示“美国必须保持核力量来对付共产主义的挑战”。
    记者说，“这些话在院外军火集团和那些认为任何走向裁军的行动都可能会损害美国整个繁荣的人中间引起了热情反应”。
    记者认为，这样的结果使人们怀疑艾森豪威尔政府所宣布它的“国际目标的虚伪性”。
    新华社伦敦24日电　今天从马德里乘飞机回到伦敦的英国工党议员罗伯特·爱德华兹对新闻记者说，这次艾森豪威尔访问马德里时所受到的“欢迎”是一场“蹩脚的马戏”。
    爱德华兹在马德里目击了这次“欢迎”的场面。他说，“大多数西班牙人都是阴沉抑郁的，欢呼的只是少数事先挑选好的人”，“其时，架设在每个建筑物顶上的机关枪都在瞄准着群众”。
    爱德华兹强调指出，正是美国“用美元维持着佛朗哥政权”。他说，“佛朗哥和他的政府要是没有美元的援助连五分钟也维持不了。”
    爱德华兹是去马德里旁听佛朗哥政权对一批西班牙民主人士的审讯的。但是他遭到佛朗哥政权逮捕，并被驱逐出境。
