Red azolla
    Red azolla, also known as full river red, originally grew wild on the water surface. Because of its high yield and good nutrition, many places have recently started cultivating it as pig feed.

    The peak season for red azolla production is the late spring, when pig feed is scarce. The feeding method is very simple: just wash off the mud and cook it in a pot. If you collect a large amount and can't feed it all at once, you can dry it for long-term storage. (Picture attached)

　　红萍
    红萍又叫满江红，原是野生在水面上的，因为它产量高、营养好，近来很多地方把它养殖起来，作为喂猪饲料。
    红萍生产旺季，正是猪饲料青黄不接的春末。喂饲方法很简单，只要洗净泥土，放在锅中煮熟即可。如果大量捞取，一时喂不完，晒干后，可以久藏不坏。（附图片）
