Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 17th: The newspapers here today published the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee's letter to all Communist Party members and working people of the country, adopted at the recent plenary session of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee.

    The letter pointed out that thanks to the nationwide movement to complete the Third Five-Year Plan within a shortened timeframe, brilliant achievements have been made in economic development this year.

    The letter continued, preliminary statistics show that the total value of products produced nationwide in 1959 will reach approximately 91 billion leva (calculated at current prices, same below), an increase of 16.7% compared to last year, greatly exceeding the total value of social products of approximately 79 billion leva stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) directives for this year.

    This year's national income will reach approximately 41 billion leva, an increase of approximately 17% compared to last year, while the total national income stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan directives for this year is about 36 billion leva.

    The letter pointed out that Bulgaria's various material production sectors are developing at a high speed. It is estimated that this year's total industrial output value will increase by approximately 25% compared to last year, approximately 19% higher than the targets stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan directives. The machinery manufacturing and metal processing sectors will produce approximately 50% more products this year than last year.

    Great achievements have also been made in developing agriculture. Although some targets stipulated in the plan were not met due to poor climatic conditions in some areas, the proportion of agricultural product growth this year is several times higher than in the past. During the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957), the average annual growth rate of agricultural products was 4.9%; the Third Five-Year Plan stipulated an average annual growth rate of 6.2%; and according to preliminary statistics, the value of agricultural products this year will increase by approximately 26% compared to last year. This year, the irrigated area increased by 2 million decares compared to last year, reaching the target stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan directives for the final year, 1962.

    This year's total investment in basic construction will be 50% more than last year, and 34% more than this year's target stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan.

    The number of employees working in the material production sector this year increased by 96,000 compared to last year.

    On the basis of rapid economic development, the material and cultural conditions of workers are also constantly improving.

    The letter to Communist Party members and working people pointed out that the achievements made in 1959 prove that the Bulgarian Communist Party's program for accelerating economic development is correct and timely; prove that the reorganization of national and economic leadership carried out at the beginning of this year is correct and in line with requirements; and prove that the decision to expand agricultural production cooperatives is correct.

    The main reasons for Bulgaria's Great Leap Forward in achieving these brilliant achievements are: the correct, wise, and mature policies of the Bulgarian Communist Party; the heroic labor of the working people of the country; and Bulgaria's cooperation with other socialist countries, especially the huge, fraternal material, technical, and scientific assistance provided by the Soviet Union.

    The letter emphasized that Bulgaria's economy must continue to leap forward next year, and pointed out that the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee has discussed and adopted the basic indicators of the 1960 plan, which will soon be discussed and approved by the National Assembly.

    Next year's plan is formulated in accordance with Bulgaria's program for accelerating economic development. Industrial output value will increase by more than 15% compared to this year. This means that in 1960, Bulgaria's industrial output value will reach the target stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan directives for 1962.

    Next year, the value of Bulgaria's agricultural products will increase by 32% compared to this year. This means that in 1960, the value of Bulgaria's agricultural products will be 4 billion leva more than the target stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan directives for 1962.

    Next year, investment in basic construction will increase by 22.9% compared to this year, approximately 1.1 billion leva more than the target stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan directives for 1962. It is estimated that next year Bulgaria's total social product value will reach 108 billion leva, an increase of 19% compared to this year. National income will increase by approximately 21.5% compared to this year. The letter to Communist Party members and working people emphasized that, according to the level of total social product production and national income, Bulgaria's Third Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule in three years next year. The letter finally called on all party members and all working people to continue to fully develop their enthusiasm and creativity, and to strive for the victorious completion and overfulfillment of the 1960 economic Great Leap Forward plan under unprecedentedly favorable domestic and international conditions.

    保共中央号召全党全民继续跃进
    明年提前完成第三个五年计划
    新华社索非亚17日电　这里的报纸今天公布了最近举行的保加利亚共产党中央委员会全体会议通过的保共中央告全国共产党员和劳动人民书。
    书中指出，由于开展了争取在缩短的期限内完成第三个五年计划的全民运动，今年在经济发展方面取得了辉煌的成就。
    书中接着说，初步统计表明，1959年全国生产的产品总值将达约九百一十亿列弗（按现在价格计算，下同），比去年增长16.7％；大大超过了第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）指示中规定的今年社会产品总值——约七百九十亿列弗。
    今年的国民收入将达到大约四百一十亿列弗，比去年增长约17％；而第三个五年计划指示规定的今年国民收入总额是三百六十亿列弗左右。
    书中指出，保加利亚的各个物质生产部门在高速度地发展着。预计，今年的工业总产值将比去年增长约25％，比第三个五年计划指示规定的指标约高19％。机器制造业和金属加工业部门今年生产的产品将比去年增加约50％。
    在发展农业方面，也取得了巨大成就。虽然由于某些地区的气候条件不好，计划规定的某些指标没有完成，但是，今年农业产品增长的比例比过去高达数倍。第二个五年计划（1953—1957年）期间，农产品平均每年增长的比例为4.9％；第三个五年计划规定每年平均增长的比例为6.2％；而根据初步统计，今年农产品的产值将比去年增长约26％。今年，灌溉面积比去年增加了二百万狄卡尔，达到了第三个五年计划指示规定的最后一年1962年的指标。
    今年的基本建设投资总额将比去年多50％，比第三个五年计划规定的今年指标多34％。
    今年在物质生产部门工作的职工人数比去年增加了九万六千人。
    在经济迅速发展的基础上，职工的物质和文化状况也在不断改善。
    告共产党员和劳动人民书指出，1959年所取得的成果，证明了保加利亚共产党所制订的加速经济发展的纲领是正确和适时的；证明了在今年年初所进行的国家和经济领导的改组是正确和符合要求的；证明了扩大农业生产合作社的决定是正确的。
    保加利亚经济跃进取得这些辉煌成就的主要原因是：保加利亚共产党的正确、英明和成熟的政策；全国劳动人民的英雄劳动；保加利亚与其他社会主义国家的合作，首先是苏联给予的巨大的、兄弟般的物质技术和科学援助。
    书中强调说，明年，保加利亚经济要继续跃进，并且指出，保共中央讨论和通过了1960年计划的基本指标，最近将由国民议会讨论和批准。
    明年的计划是根据保加利亚的加速经济发展的纲领制订的。工业产值将比今年增长15％以上。这意味着，在1960年，保加利亚工业产值就将达到第三个五年计划指示规定的1962年的指标。
    明年，保加利亚农产品的产值将比今年增长32％。这意味着，1960年，保加利亚农产品的产值比第三个五年计划指示规定的1962年的指标还要多四十亿列弗。
    明年，基本建设投资将比今年增加22.9％，比第三个五年计划指示规定的1962年的指标还多约十一亿列弗。预计，明年保加利亚的社会产品总值将达一千零八十亿列弗，比今年增长19％。国民收入将比今年增长约21.5％。告共产党员和劳动人民书中强调指出，按照总社会产品生产和国民收入的水平，保加利亚第三个五年计划将用三年的时间在明年提前完成。书中最后号召全体党员和全体劳动人民继续充分发挥积极性和创造性，在空前有利的国内和国际条件下，为胜利完成和超额完成1960年的经济跃进计划而斗争。
