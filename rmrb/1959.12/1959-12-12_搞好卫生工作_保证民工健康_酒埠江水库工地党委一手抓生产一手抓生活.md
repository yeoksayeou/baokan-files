Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 10th: Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the Jiubujiang Reservoir construction site, jointly built by You County and Liling County in Hunan Province, has actively carried out sanitation work to ensure the health of migrant workers. In the past two months, the attendance rate of migrant workers has often remained above 95%.

The Jiubujiang Reservoir began construction last year. After the start of construction, the Party organization at the construction site grasped both construction and life simultaneously. In February of this year, leading groups for eliminating pests and diseases were established at all levels, led by the Party Secretary, with designated personnel in charge. The heads of Party organizations at all levels frequently went deep into construction sites, work sheds, and medical units to supervise and inspect sanitation work. The entire construction area has a hospital and three medical stations, and health workers have also been trained in each team, ensuring that wherever there are migrant workers, there is medicine. Since the beginning of autumn this year, the entire construction area has launched several mass sanitation campaigns, eliminating a large number of rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies, and the sanitation of the construction site has been continuously improved.

In terms of environmental sanitation, all 231 work sheds in the entire construction area were built on relatively high terrain. Each work shed has skylights, and high bunks were erected inside with wood. Ditches were dug around the four sides of the work sheds to keep the sheds dry, well-ventilated, and sunny. Each work shed has established a sanitation system and sanitation covenants, and a health worker is dedicated to the sanitation inside and outside the work shed and to washing and drying the migrant workers' clothing and bedding. The inside and outside of the work sheds are often clean and tidy, with no garbage, mud, or weeds to be seen. Public toilets and temporary toilets were built near the work sheds and construction sites respectively. Health workers used methods such as burning wild plants and scalding with boiling water to kill maggots and eliminate flies, ensuring regular cleaning of feces and maintaining the cleanliness of the toilets. In terms of food hygiene, dining halls and kitchens are generally built far away from work sheds and toilets, and migrant workers with good backgrounds, good skills, and good health were selected to be responsible for cooking. Dining halls and kitchens have also established sanitation systems and sanitation covenants. The cooks are generally trained and basically achieve "four withouts" (no chaff, sand, grains, or barnyard grass in the rice) and "four hots" (hot rice, hot dishes, hot water, hot tea), and ensure the supply of boiling water on the construction site.

In order to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases, medical personnel, under the leadership of the Party, went deep into work sheds, construction sites, and canteens. In addition to strengthening the sanitary management of canteens, kitchens, surrounding areas of work sheds, and construction sites, and achieving early detection and timely isolation and treatment of patients with infectious diseases, they also mobilized the masses to collect local herbs and promote effective local prescriptions and local medicines for treatment.

    搞好卫生工作　保证民工健康
    酒埠江水库工地党委一手抓生产一手抓生活
    新华社长沙10日电　湖南省攸县和醴陵县合修的酒埠江水库工地在党委领导下，积极开展卫生工作，保证了民工健康。近两个月来，民工出勤率经常保持在95％以上。
    酒埠江水库是去年动工修建的，开工后，工地党组织就一手抓施工，一手抓生活，今年2月间，层层成立了除害灭病领导小组，由党委书记挂帅，确定专人负责，各级党组织负责人经常深入工地、工棚和医疗单位，督促检查卫生工作。全工地设有一个医院和三个医疗站，还在各队训练了卫生员，做到了哪里有民工，哪里就有医药。今年入秋以来，全工区先后开展多次群众性的卫生突击运动，消灭了大量的鼠雀蚊蝇，工地卫生不断改善。
    在环境卫生方面，全工区二百三十一个工棚都搭盖在地势较高的地方，每个工棚开有天窗，棚内都用木料架起了高铺，工棚周围四边开沟，使棚内干燥、空气流通，阳光充足。每个工棚制订了卫生制度和卫生公约，并有一个卫生员专搞工棚内外的卫生和洗晒民工的衣被。工棚里里外外经常干干净净，看不到垃圾、污泥和杂草。工棚附近和工地都分别修建了公共厕所和临时厕所，卫生员用野生植物烧熏和开水烫等办法杀蛆灭蝇，做到了经常清除粪便，保持了厕所的清洁。在饮食卫生方面，食堂、厨房一般都修建在离工棚、厕所较远的地方，选择了成分好、技术好、身体好的民工担负炊事工作。食堂和厨房也建立了卫生制度和卫生公约。炊事人员一般都经过训练，基本上做到了“四无”（饭内无糠皮、砂子、谷粒、稗子）“四热”（饭热、菜热、水热、茶热），并且保证了工地的开水供应。
    为了预防传染病的发生，医务人员在党的领导下，深入工棚、工地、食堂，除加强了食堂、厨房、工棚周围和施工场所的卫生管理，对传染病患者做到早期发现、及时隔离治疗外，还发动群众采挖土药，推广行之有效的土方土药治病。（附图片）
