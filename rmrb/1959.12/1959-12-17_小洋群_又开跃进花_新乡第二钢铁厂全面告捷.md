Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 15th -- The Xinxiang Municipal State-owned No. 2 Steel Plant in Henan Province, where the production level of small blast furnaces has been continuously improving, has comprehensively overfulfilled this year's state plan twenty-one days ahead of schedule. As of December 10, the annual total output value plan was completed by 117.79%, profits by 128.01%, pig iron production by 156.14%, the pig iron qualification rate reached 91.96%, labor productivity increased by 18.89% compared with the planned target, the cost of each ton of iron decreased by more than 1% compared with the plan, the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces was 1.136, and the average coke consumption per ton of iron was 1.2 tons.

The Xinxiang No. 6 Steel Plant is an enterprise that transitioned from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups" at the beginning of this year. At present, the plant has five 13-cubic-meter small blast furnaces, as well as a relatively complete production system serving blast furnace production, including coal washing and coking, mechanical repair, ore crushing, furnace burden management, transportation, and testing.

More than half a year ago, the plant's production technology level was still relatively low. The three small blast furnaces put into production in January and February had an average utilization coefficient of only about 0.6. Due to the low iron content of the ore and low wind temperature, most of the iron produced was white pig iron, and the cost of iron was also relatively high. The workers were mostly novices and encountered many difficulties in production technology. After studying this situation, the factory Party committee decided to mobilize the workers to carry out technical innovations in a planned and step-by-step manner around the weak links in production, gradually realize the technical transformation of the entire factory, and comprehensively promote production.

The approach of the factory Party committee was: first, to establish in the minds of the workers the unwavering thought of continuous revolution. At that time, some people believed that "low ore grade, poor equipment, cannot achieve high yields," and that "high quality and high yield are contradictory," and so on. The Party committee organized mass debates, conducted specific analyses of some difficulties in production, pointed out the favorable factors for overcoming difficulties, emphasized the need to give play to subjective initiative, and the secretary took the lead in cultivating "experimental plots" in No. 3 furnace, cultivating typical examples of high yield and high quality. In the process of cultivating "experimental plots," Party Secretary Dong Benxiang adopted the suggestion of Zhao Jingru, the director of the hot blast stove, improved the hot blast stove, and increased the blower speed from 300 rpm to 600 rpm, implemented blower paralleling, and promoted the experience of multi-nozzle combustion. In addition, a series of technical measures were taken, such as roasting ore, strengthening batching, testing, coal washing and coking, which resulted in an increase in wind temperature from 400 degrees to 600-700 degrees, a coke ratio from 1:1.3 to 1:0.9, a pig iron qualification rate of 100%, and a utilization coefficient of over 2.

The factory Party committee seized the vivid example of high quality and high yield of the No. 3 furnace, and carried out extensive publicity and education throughout the factory, crushed all kinds of right-leaning thoughts, and greatly encouraged all employees to continue to break through difficulties and do a good job in production. A wave of technological innovation quickly formed throughout the factory. Foundry workers and stevedores cast 800-meter-long light rails with pig iron, realizing the railization of transportation throughout the factory, reducing transportation costs and the cost of pig iron. The machine repair workshop workers rushed to make a large-scale ore crusher with a daily output of 240 tons in six days, increasing production efficiency by seven or eight times, and the ore particle size was more uniform than before, and the number of crushed ore workers was reduced from 290 to 40. Furnace workers cooperated with machine repair workers to create mouth-blocking machinery, ensuring safe production in front of the furnace and eliminating burn accidents.

Due to the continuous improvement of the technical level, the production of the entire plant showed a situation of rising steadily and continuous leaping forward. From January to now, the plant has overfulfilled its monthly plans in terms of the quality and output of pig iron. There has also been great improvement in labor organization. The responsibilities of all employees in the plant are clear, and each shift can complete the task calmly with only seven or eight people, changing the past phenomenon of many people being busy and chaotic, and labor productivity has been greatly improved. The factory has also initially established a team-based economic accounting system, improving the management level of the enterprise. The technology of the vast majority of employees in the plant has reached the standard of Grade 2 or even Grade 3 or 4.

All the employees of the Xinxiang No. 2 Steel Plant are currently carrying out a larger-scale technical innovation campaign, creating new achievements to dedicate to the New Year, and providing more favorable conditions for doing a good job in the first quarter production next year.

    “小洋群”又开跃进花
    新乡第二钢铁厂全面告捷
    新华社郑州15日电　小高炉生产水平不断提高的河南新乡市地方国营第二钢铁厂，已经提前二十一天全面超额完成今年的国家计划。到12月10日止，全年总产值计划完成117.79％，利润完成128.01％，生铁产量完成156.14％，生铁合格率达到91.96％，劳动生产率比计划指标提高18.89％，每吨铁的成本比计划下降1％多，高炉平均利用系数为一点一三六，平均每吨铁的耗焦量为一点二吨。
    新乡第六钢铁厂是今年年初由“小土群”过渡到“小洋群”的企业。目前全厂共有五个十三立方米的小高炉，以及为高炉生产服务的洗煤炼焦、机械修理、矿石粉碎、炉料管理、运输、化验等一套比较完整的生产体系。
    半年多以前，这个厂的生产技术水平还是比较低的。1、2月份投入生产的三个小高炉，利用系数平均只有零点六左右，由于矿石含铁量低、风温低，生产出来的多是白口铁，铁的成本也比较高。工人多是新手，在生产技术上也遇到不少困难。工厂党委研究了这一情况以后，决定发动职工围绕各个生产薄弱环节有计划有步骤地革新技术，逐步实现全厂的技术改造，全面推动生产。
    工厂党委的作法是：首先在职工中树立坚定不移的不断革命思想。当时，有人认为“矿石品位低、设备差、不能高产”，“优质高产矛盾”等等。党委一面组织群众大辩论，对生产上一些困难进行了具体分析，指出克服困难的有利因素，强调要发挥主观能动性，一面由书记带头深入三号炉种“试验田”，培养高产优质典型。在种“试验田”的过程中，党委书记董本祥采纳热风炉炉长赵敬儒的建议，改进了热风炉，同时把鼓风机转速由三百转加到六百转，实行风机并联，推广多嘴燃烧经验。此外，还采取了焙烧矿石，加强配料、化验、洗煤炼焦等一系列技术措施，结果使风温由四百度提高到六七百度，焦比由一比一点三变为一比零点九，生铁合格率提高到100％，利用系数上升到二以上。
    工厂党委抓住三号炉优质高产的生动事例，在全厂大张旗鼓地进行宣传教育，粉碎了形形色色的右倾思想，大大鼓舞了全体职工继续突破难关搞好生产的信心。全厂迅速形成革新技术的热潮。翻砂工和装卸工用生铁铸造成八百米长的轻便轨道，使全厂运输实现了轨道化，降低了运输费用和生铁的成本。机修车间工人在六天之内赶制成一部日产二百四十吨的大型矿石粉碎机，使生产效率提高七、八倍，矿石粒度比以往均匀，碎矿工人由二百九十名减少为四十名。炉前工与机修工协作，创造了堵口机械，保证了炉前安全生产，杜绝了烧伤事故。
    由于技术水平的不断提高，全厂生产出现了步步高涨，持续跃进的局面。从1月到现在，这个厂生铁的质量、产量方面，月月超额完成计划。劳动组织也有很大改进，全厂职工责任明确，每班只要七、八人就能从容地完成任务，改变了过去人多忙乱的现象，劳动生产率大大提高。工厂还初步建立班组经济核算制度，提高了企业的管理水平。全厂绝大多数职工的技术都已达到二级以上甚至三、四级的标准。
    新乡第二钢铁厂全体职工目前正在开展更大规模的技术革新运动，创造新的成就向新年献礼，并为明年搞好第一季度生产提供更为有利的条件。
