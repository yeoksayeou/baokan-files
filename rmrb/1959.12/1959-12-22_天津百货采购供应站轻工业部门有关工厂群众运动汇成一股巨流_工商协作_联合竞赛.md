　　Tianjin, December 21st (Reporter Lü Su Xuan): The industry-commerce collaboration and grand competition jointly organized by the Tianjin General Merchandise Purchasing and Supply Station and related factories in the light industry sector have achieved good results. Through the competition, the "Six Goods" competition of the commercial sector and the "high output, high quality, low consumption, multi-variety" production increase and economy movement of the industrial sector have been closely combined, making the mass movements of the industry and commerce departments converge into a torrent, which has powerfully promoted production and expanded the supply of goods. Since August, the production of these factories has been rising steadily, and the quality of 233 products such as electric clocks, batteries, rubber shoes, and enamel products has been significantly improved. 184 new products and more than 600 new designs of daily-use merchandise such as anti-odor sneakers and small sewing machines have been produced. At the same time, the General Merchandise Purchasing and Supply Station has overfulfilled its purchase and supply plans every month. In the past eleven months, the total value of purchases by this station has increased by 61.1% compared with the same period last year, and the total value of supplies has increased by more than 50%.

　　The General Merchandise Purchasing and Supply Station and related factories carry out the industry-commerce collaboration and grand competition with the central content of promoting production and meeting market needs. The commercial departments, focusing on supporting the industry in achieving "high output, high quality, low consumption, multi-variety," have competition conditions such as: "Do everything possible to assist industrial departments in solving difficulties in raw materials, materials, packaging materials, and production; actively assist industry in improving product quality and increasing variety," etc. The industrial departments propose: "Produce whatever the market needs, and do our best to make supplies," to achieve "Four Satisfactions" (satisfaction with increased output, satisfaction with improved quality, satisfaction with expanded variety, and satisfaction with being marketable). Because different industries have different characteristics and requirements, the forms of industry-commerce collaboration and grand competition carried out by industry and commerce are also diverse. The purchasing and supply station and factories with large production scales such as the hat industry and rubber industry have launched a "layered counterpart competition for industry-commerce collaboration." The Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations of both sides are counterparts; the various business professional sections, inspectors, and salesmen of the purchasing station, and the production workshops, quality inspectors, and sales personnel of the factories carry out competition at different levels, forming a situation where everyone has a competitor and the competition has a broad mass base. For some products with a wider collaboration scope, where most factories serve one type of product, a "chain collaboration production competition between industry and factories" has been launched. For example, sixteen production units in the daily chemical industry, such as factories producing soap, toothpaste, and cosmetics, as well as tube factories, wooden box factories, and printing factories producing packaging materials for these factories, have jointly cooperated, supported each other, and jointly carried out competition with the purchasing and supply station. For factories producing small commodities such as children's toys and leather goods, because there are many varieties and the designs change quickly, a "one-stop collaboration competition of production, supply, and sales" with the participation of retail departments has been launched. This allows timely innovation of designs and improvement of varieties based on consumer feedback.

　　Through competition, industry and commerce departments have promoted industry-commerce collaboration to a new stage, and a new atmosphere of "industry and commerce as one family" has emerged, with "industry sharing commercial difficulties, industry taking care of market supply, commerce as the industry's supply and marketing department, and industry as the commercial workshop." The General Merchandise Purchasing and Supply Station and related factories have established fifteen industry-commerce material preparation groups to jointly find raw materials and allocate them for unified use. In the past four months, these material preparation groups have urged and found more than 10,000 tons of various raw materials such as oil, soda ash, and reclaimed rubber from various places. Glycerin alone is enough to produce 1.8 million tubes of toothpaste, and reclaimed rubber can be used to increase the production of more than 100,000 pairs of rubber shoes. In order to assist the industry in improving product quality and increasing variety, the supply station has sent special personnel to Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, and other places to collect more than 3,000 advanced samples and some process production materials for the industry to use as a reference. The various business professional sections of this station have held product quality comparison exhibitions, inviting factories to visit and evaluate, and exchange experiences. Many factories have actively learned from advanced factories through visits and evaluations, formulated short-term plans to improve quality, and immediately studied and improved. The Tianjin Soap Factory has established a quality improvement working group, determined to bring the quality of soap up to the advanced level in China this year.

　　The industrial sector regards ensuring market supply as its unshirkable responsibility. Recently, large-scale water conservancy construction has been carried out in various places, and the market demand for all-rubber shoes has doubled. The workers of various rubber factories have actively tried to increase the production of all-rubber shoes. In the past, Tianjin did not produce cotton-rubber shoes. After the purchasing and supply station reflected the market needs to the Yutai Rubber Factory, the workers of this factory overcame the difficulty of insufficient sewing strength, timely put them into production, and increased the output from 20,000 pairs to 85,000 pairs, and began to supply the market in early November. When the Wuzhou Daily Chemical Factory learned that the supply station had difficulty in completing the supply contract for toothpaste, cosmetics, and other commodities in November, all the workers in the factory concentrated their efforts to rush production, and the workers in the supply station also went to the factory to help rush the commodity sorting and packaging. As a result, the supply contract was guaranteed to be completed on schedule.

　　Strengthening the connection between the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations of the industry and commerce departments is the key to ensuring that the competition movement is higher than the previous wave. The Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations of both sides have established a regular contact system to study the development of the movement, timely solve the problems that arise, consolidate the achievements of the competition, and deploy the next stage of competition activities separately. The Party organizations on both sides educate employees in the competition to establish the communist ideology of leaving difficulties to themselves and giving convenience to others. The Party Committee of the General Merchandise Purchasing and Supply Station of the Communist Party of China also includes the key issues in industrial production in the agenda of the branch's monthly research, makes corresponding decisions, and mobilizes employees to implement them.

　　The industry and commerce departments participating in the competition have also organized a competition committee to implement joint industry-commerce and factory-to-factory office work, and regularly check the progress of the competition. A competition bulletin is also published to promptly commend advanced examples that appear on both sides; advanced experiences that appear in the competition are also exchanged in a timely manner. In this way, the mass movement carried out by the industry and commerce departments is closely integrated from the business, ideological, and organizational aspects.

　　天津百货采购供应站轻工业部门有关工厂群众运动汇成一股巨流
    工商协作　联合竞赛
    本报天津21日电　记者吕素瑄报道：天津市百货采购供应站和轻工业部门有关工厂联合举办的工商协作大联赛，已经取得了良好的效果。通过联赛，把商业部门的“六好”竞赛和工业部门的“高产、优质、低耗、多品种”的增产节约运动紧密地结合起来了；使工商部门的群众运动汇成一股巨流，有力地促进了生产，扩大了商品供应。8月份以来，这些工厂的生产节节上升，电钟、电池、胶鞋、搪瓷制品等二百三十三种产品的质量有了显著提高；生产了防臭球鞋、小型缝纫机等一百八十四种新产品和六百多种新花样的日用百货。同时，百货采购供应站月月超额完成进货和供应计划。十一个月以来，这个站进货总值比去年同期增长了61.1％，供应总值增加了50％以上。
    百货采购供应站和有关工厂开展工商协作大联赛，是以促进生产和满足市场需要为中心内容。商业部门围绕着支持工业实现“高产、优质、低耗、多品种”，竞赛条件是：“千方百计协助工业部门解决原料、材料、包装物料和生产中的困难；积极协助工业提高产品质量、增加花色品种”等。工业部门则提出：“市场需要什么就生产什么，全力作好供应”，作到“四满意”（增加产量满意、提高质量满意、扩大品种满意、适销对路满意）。由于不同的行业具有不同的特点和要求，因此，工商双方开展的工商协作大联赛的形式也是多种多样的。采购供应站和生产规模较大的全能厂像制帽业、橡胶业等行业的工厂，开展了“工商协作分层对口赛”。双方的党、政、工、团组织对口；采购站的各业务专业科、验收员、业务员，和各工厂的生产车间、质量检验员、供销人员分层对口开展竞赛，形成人人有竞赛对手，竞赛具有广泛的群众基础。对有些产品协作面较宽，多数工厂为一种产品服务的各厂，开展了“工商、厂厂连锁协作生产赛”。像日用化学行业的肥皂、牙膏、化妆品等工厂以及为这些工厂生产包装用物的制管厂、木箱厂、印刷厂等十六个生产单位联合在一起、互相配合、互相支援共同和采购供应站开展竞赛。对生产儿童玩具、皮件制品等小百货的工厂，因为品种多、花色变化快，开展了有零售部门参加的“产供销一条龙协作赛”。这样就能够及时根据消费者意见，不断的翻新花样改进品种。
    工商部门通过竞赛，把工商协作推向了一个新阶段，出现了“工业困难商业分担、市场供应工业要管，商业是工业供销部、工业是商业的车间”，工商一家的新气象。百货采购供应站和有关工厂建立了十五个工商备料小组，共同寻找原料，统一分配使用，最近四个月来，这些备料小组向各地催调和找到油料、纯碱、再生胶等各种原料一万多吨，其中仅甘油就够生产一百八十万支牙膏的用量，再生胶可供增产十万多双胶鞋。供应站为了协助工业提高产品质量、增加花色品种，曾派出专人到北京、上海、武汉、西安等地，为工业部门搜集了三千多种先进样品和部分工艺生产资料，供工业部门参考。这个站的各业务专业科分别举办产品质量对比展览会，邀请工厂参观评比，相互交流经验。许多工厂通过参观评比积极向先进工厂学习，作出短期提高质量的方案，立即研究改进。天津市香皂厂成立了改进质量工作组，决心在今年内使香皂质量赶上国内的先进水平。
    工业部门把保证市场供应当成义不容辞的责任。最近各地大搞水利建设，市场上全胶鞋需要量倍增，各橡胶厂职工便积极设法增产全胶鞋。过去天津不生产棉胶鞋，当采购供应站把市场需要的情况反映给裕泰橡胶厂后，这个工厂的职工克服了缝纫力量不足的困难，及时投入生产，并且把产量由两万双提高到八万五千双，在11月初就开始供应市场。当五洲日用化学工厂知道供应站完成11月的牙膏化妆品等商品的供应合同有困难时，全厂职工就集中力量突击生产，供应站职工也下厂帮助突击商品整理和包装。结果保证了供应合同按期完成。
    工商部门的党政工团组织加强联系，是保证竞赛运动一浪高过一浪的关键。双方党政工团组织分别建立了定期联系制度，研究运动发展情况，及时解决出现的问题，巩固竞赛成果，分头布署下一阶段的竞赛活动。双方党组织在竞赛中教育职工树立困难留给自己、方便送给别人的共产主义思想。中共百货采购供应站党委会还把工业生产中的关键问题，列入支部每月研究的议程，作出相应的决定，发动职工贯彻执行。
    参加竞赛的工商部门还组织了竞赛委员会，实行工商、厂厂联合办公，定期检查竞赛开展的情况。并且还出版了一种竞赛通报，对双方出现的先进事例及时进行表扬；竞赛中出现的先进经验，也及时进行交流。这样就把工商部门开展的群众运动，从业务，思想以至组织上都紧密结合在一起了。
