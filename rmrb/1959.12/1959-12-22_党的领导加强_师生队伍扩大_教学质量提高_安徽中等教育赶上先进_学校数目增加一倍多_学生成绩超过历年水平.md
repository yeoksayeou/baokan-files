Strengthening Party Leadership, Expanding Teacher and Student Ranks, Improving Teaching Quality
    Anhui Secondary Education Catches Up with Advanced Levels
    Number of Schools More Than Doubled; Student Achievement Surpasses Previous Levels

    (Our Dispatch) Anhui Province's secondary schools have been greatly increasing revolutionary drive, striving for excellence, and resolutely implementing the Party's education policy, leading to a significant improvement in the quality of education. This year's unified entrance examination results for higher education institutions have greatly exceeded previous examination results, reaching the advanced level in the country.

    This year, 7,129 graduates from 58 senior high schools in Anhui Province participated in the national unified entrance examination for higher education institutions, with significant improvements in scores compared to 1957. Among them, scores in political common sense increased by more than 12 points, mathematics scores increased by more than 22 points, and Chinese language scores also improved. Due to the increased political awareness of the candidates, the vast majority of them were able to provide comprehensive and correct answers to questions regarding the speed of China's socialist construction, the superiority of the people's communes, and the necessity to accelerate China's socialist construction.

    The foundation of education in Anhui Province was very weak before liberation. Although it has been actively restored and greatly developed since liberation, it still lags behind. However, under the correct leadership of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, it resolutely implemented the central government's policies, constantly criticized and overcame right-leaning thoughts and fears of difficulty, absorbed the educational experience of the old liberated areas, and implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, so that education and the quality of education have been continuously developed and improved. In 1956, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the glorious task of "accelerating the development of education, actively improving the quality of education, and catching up with the national level within a certain number of years," and successively convened several representative meetings of advanced educational workers, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses in running schools, greatly encouraging the revolutionary drive of educational workers throughout the province, striving for excellence, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. During this period, not only was there great development in quantity, but also great efforts were made to improve the quality of teaching.

    In 1958, a great leap forward in education appeared, with the number of secondary schools increasing from 302 in 1957 to 720. With the great leap forward, great development, and great revolution in education, the Party's leadership over education has been greatly strengthened. 97% of the secondary schools in the province are equipped with Party member principals, and many schools have established the core leadership of the Party. The schools have established and consolidated the Party's leading position, resolutely implemented the Party's education policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, reversing the tendency in education work to be divorced from politics, production, and reality. Because of adhering to putting politics in command, correctly implementing the Party's policy on intellectuals, and actively giving play to the leading role of teachers in teaching, and constantly improving students' socialist consciousness, a fundamental guarantee was provided for improving the quality of education and cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

    In 1958, a high tide of implementing the Party's education policy, a great leap forward in education, and an education revolution were launched throughout the province. In order to fully implement the Party's education policy, the Provincial Party Committee successively convened five education work conferences, and timely put forward the principles that school productive labor should be based on industrial and agricultural productive labor, mainly in-school productive labor, and mainly collective productive labor, so that the work-study program had the correct direction. On the basis of the "three main principles," schools also launched a great upsurge in running factories and farms, and participated in the political movement of the whole people running steel and autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. In the movement, many schools paid great attention to the arrangement of teaching and productive labor, and the Provincial Party Committee also comprehensively arranged teaching and labor time according to the spirit of the central government on full-time schools focusing on teaching, and established a new teaching order combining teaching with production. By adopting various methods to combine teaching and productive labor, linking theory with practice, students can widely participate in productive labor, improve class consciousness, establish correct learning viewpoints, master production knowledge, and ensure that students learn basic knowledge well. Students have achieved all-round development in moral, intellectual, and physical education. For example, Bengbu No. 3 Middle School strengthened the connection between labor practice and theoretical teaching. All teachers were assigned to relevant workshops and farms in the school. When teaching the theorem "two parallel straight lines determine a plane" in solid geometry in senior high school, they would go to the carpentry workshop, draw parallel lines on both sides of the wood, and then saw it into a wooden board to form a plane, making it easy for students to understand this concept.

    In 1958, under the situation of the all-round great leap forward in socialist construction, many schools boosted their energy, strived for excellence, and changed their original backwardness. For example, Dangshan Middle School was originally a newly established school. This year, the first graduates participated in the national unified entrance examination for higher education institutions and achieved excellent results. In 1957, Guichi Middle School ranked second to last in the province in the unified entrance examination for higher education institutions. This year, the results have been greatly improved and ranked among the top in the province. The teaching staff of Chaoxian High School was originally poor. Because the school leaders attached importance to the work of teacher training, fully exerted the role of veteran teachers, and actively trained and improved new teachers, the needs of teaching were basically met.

    Strengthening the teaching staff and improving the political and professional level of teachers is an important guarantee for improving the quality of teaching. After several political movements, the ideological level of teachers has been significantly improved, and they have actively exerted their subjective initiative, thus consciously striving to improve teaching and improve the quality of teaching. In recent years, in addition to developing teacher education and increasing the source of teachers, Party committees at all levels have also transferred a group of cadres from government agencies and demobilized soldiers to strengthen the middle school teaching staff. For the newly supplemented teachers, all schools have made training plans, adopted a combination of long-term training and short-term training, and a combination of on-the-job learning and off-the-job further study, which has greatly improved the political and professional level of teachers.

    Now, the vast number of teachers and students in Anhui are launching a high tide of in-depth study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, resolutely opposing right-leaning, boosting their energy, striving for excellence, and striving to further implement the Party's education policy, improve the quality of teaching, and realize the continued leap forward of teaching and productive labor.

　　党的领导加强　师生队伍扩大　教学质量提高
    安徽中等教育赶上先进
    学校数目增加一倍多　学生成绩超过历年水平
    本报讯　安徽省中等学校大鼓革命干劲，力争上游，坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针，教育质量有显著提高。今年高等学校统一招生考试成绩大大超过历年考试成绩，达到全国先进水平。
    安徽省今年五十八所高级中学，有七千一百二十九名毕业生，参加了全国高等学校入学统一考试，成绩与1957年比较，有显著提高。其中政治常识成绩增加十二分多，数学成绩增加二十二分多，语文成绩也有提高。由于考生政治觉悟的提高，绝大多数考生对我国的社会主义建设速度、人民公社的优越性、必须加速我国社会主义建设等问题，都能全面而正确地进行回答。
    安徽教育事业的基础在解放前很薄弱，解放后虽经积极恢复和大发展，仍然比较落后。但在中共安徽省委正确领导下，坚决贯彻执行了中央的方针政策，不断批判和克服右倾思想和畏难情绪，吸收了老解放区的教育经验，执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，使教育事业和教育质量得到不断发展和提高。1956年省委提出了：“加速教育事业的发展，积极提高教育质量，在一定年限内赶上国家水平”的光荣任务，并先后召开了多次先进教育工作者代表会议，充分发动群众办学的积极性，大大鼓舞了全省教育工作者的革命干劲，力争上游，学先进、赶先进。在这个时期，不仅数量上有很大发展，还大力进行了提高教学质量的工作。
    1958年教育事业出现了大跃进的局面，中等学校由1957年的三百零二所增加到七百二十所。随着教育事业的大跃进大发展和大革命，党对教育工作的领导大大地加强了，全省97％的中等学校都配备了党员校长，其中不少学校已经建立了党的核心领导。学校确立和巩固了党的领导地位，坚决地贯彻执行了党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，扭转了教育工作中脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的倾向。由于坚持政治挂帅，正确贯彻党的知识分子政策，积极发挥教师在教学上的主导作用，不断提高学生的社会主义觉悟，为提高教育质量，培养有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者，提供了根本的保证。
    1958年，在全省范围内掀起了贯彻党的教育方针、教育事业大跃进和教育革命的高潮。为全面贯彻党的教育方针，省委连续召开了五次教育工作会议，并及时地提出了学校生产劳动，要以工农业生产劳动为主、校内生产劳动为主、集体生产劳动为主的原则，使勤工俭学活动有了正确的方向。各校在“三为主”的基础上，又掀起了大办工厂、农场的热潮，参加了全民大办钢铁和秋收秋耕秋种的政治运动。在运动中，很多学校对教学和生产劳动的安排都很注意，省委还根据中央关于全日制学校以教学为主的精神，全面地安排了教学、劳动时间，建立了教学结合生产的新的教学秩序。由于采取各种方法，使教学和生产劳动结合起来，理论联系实际，使学生既能广泛地参加生产劳动，提高阶级觉悟，树立正确的学习观点，掌握生产知识，又能保证学生学好基础知识。使学生的德育、智育、体育都得到了全面发展。如蚌埠三中加强了劳动实践和理论教学的联系，所有教师都分别与学校有关车间和农场挂钩。高中立体几何讲“两条平行直线决定一平面”的定理时，就到木工车间，在木头两侧画上平行线，然后按线路锯成木板形成平面，学生很容易理解这一概念。
    1958年在社会主义建设全面大跃进的局面下，很多学校鼓足干劲，力争上游，改变了原来落后面貌。如砀山中学原是一所新办学校，今年第一届毕业生参加全国高等学校统一招生考试，取得优异成绩；贵池中学1957年参加高等学校统一招生考试成绩，名列全省倒数第二，今年成绩大大提高，名列全省前茅；巢县高中师资条件原来较差，由于学校领导重视师资培养的工作，充分发挥老教师的作用，积极培养和提高了新教师，基本上满足了教学的需要。
    壮大教师队伍和提高教师政治、业务水平，是提高教学质量的重要保证。经过历次政治运动，教师的思想水平有显著提高，积极发挥了主观能动性，因而自觉地努力改进教学，提高教学质量。几年来，除了发展师范教育，增加师资来源，各级党委还从机关干部和转业军人中调配一批干部，充实中学教师队伍。对于新补充的师资，各校都做出培养规划，采取长期培养和短期训练 相结合，在职学习和离职进修相结合的办法，大大提高了教师的政治和业务水平。
    现在，安徽广大师生，正掀起深入学习党的八届八中全会文件的热潮，坚决反掉右倾，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为进一步贯彻党的教育方针，提高教学质量，实现教学和生产劳动继续跃进而努力奋斗。
