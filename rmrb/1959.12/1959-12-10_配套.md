Short Commentary

    To fully realize the effectiveness of irrigation and to bring about the benefits of projects as early as possible is a matter of paramount importance in water conservancy construction. In this respect, Andong County in Liaoning Province and the Huitang Commune in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, have provided us with excellent experiences.

    A machine cannot operate if it lacks parts, and a train cannot run without a railway. Therefore, industrial production emphasizes complete sets of production and supply, and unified planning. Water conservancy construction is the same. If there are only reservoirs but no canals, water cannot be delivered to the fields; or even if there are canals, if the land is not leveled in time, irrigation cannot be carried out effectively. Andong County in Liaoning has correctly solved this problem. In this winter and next spring's water conservancy construction, they will not only build new projects to expand the irrigated area, but also actively repair and expand existing water conservancy projects, and vigorously grasp the work of water conservancy matching, taking measures to supplement what is lacking and completing each project as it is built, so as to fully realize the benefits of irrigation projects. The Huitang Commune in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, has also solved this problem. When building reservoirs, this commune connects the main dam, auxiliary dam, spillway, and canals, considering them comprehensively and arranging them uniformly, to ensure that the dam is completed and the canals are open, so as to realize the benefits of the project as quickly as possible.

    Does such an approach blur priorities, or slow down the speed of water conservancy construction? The facts from the Huitang Commune can well answer this question. This commune has two reservoirs, one is the Wenchong Reservoir, built in 1957. From the beginning, the main dam, spillway, and diversion canal were arranged uniformly. By the end of the year, all projects were completed simultaneously. In the spring of 1958, water storage began, and it quickly played its role in flood control and irrigation. The other is the Shitang Reservoir, built in 1953. In that year, only the main dam was built, and the spillway was not built. When the water rose in the spring of the following year, it was impossible to store water; later, the spillway was built, but the canals were not completed. In that year, the reservoir did not play its due role in flood control and drought resistance. This clear contrast illustrates that water conservancy projects must be built as a complete set, in one go, without leaving any unfinished work, so as to realize the irrigation benefits as quickly as possible.

    Of course, to ensure that water conservancy construction is complete, a lot of work needs to be done. First of all, the overall layout of the project must have a global perspective, so that large, medium, and small water conservancy projects can cooperate with new soil and water conservation projects and existing projects. When the project is launched, it is necessary to correctly estimate the subjective forces and objective conditions, and do everything possible to ensure that the project can be completed on time and in complete sets. Secondly, to complete water conservancy construction projects in sets within a short period of time, it is also necessary to rationally arrange labor, vigorously carry out tool reforms, and improve project efficiency. In this regard, some of the practices of the Huitang Commune are very valuable for reference. They flexibly organized labor according to the four aspects of the main dam, auxiliary dam, spillway, and canal projects, and carried out cross-operations to ensure that construction started in all areas and would be completed simultaneously in the future. The policy adopted by Andong County of "Do it early if you can, not late; do more if you can, not less; do it this year if you can, not next year" is also very correct. We must strive to complete a water conservancy project to realize the benefits of a water conservancy project, and use our valuable labor and financial resources in the most effective places, to ensure that the fruits of our water conservancy construction play a role in agricultural production in the coming year.

    充分发挥灌溉效能和提早发挥工程效益是水利建设中头等重要的问题。辽宁省安东县和湖南省宁乡县灰汤公社在这方面为我们提供了很好的经验。
    一部机器缺了零件就转动不起来，有了火车而没有铁路，火车也不能运转，因此工业生产上讲究成套生产，成套供应，讲究统一安排。水利建设也是一样，如果只有水库没有渠道，水就放不到田里去；或者有了渠道，土地没有及时平整，还是不能很好进行灌溉。辽宁安东县正确地解决了这个问题，他们在今冬明春的水利建设中，既要兴修新的工程，扩大灌溉面积；又要积极整修和扩修现有的水利工程，大抓水利配套工作，采取缺什么补什么，修一个成一个，以便充分发挥灌溉工程的效益。湖南宁乡县灰汤公社也解决了这个问题，这个公社在修建水库时，把主坝、副坝、溢洪道和渠道等工程联系起来，通盘考虑，统一安排，保证做到坝成渠通，以便最快地发挥工程效益。
    这样作是不是有点不分轻重缓急呢，是不是会减慢水利建设的速度呢？灰汤公社的事实很能回答这个问题。这个公社有两个水库，一个是1957年兴建的文冲水库，一开始就做到大坝、溢洪道和引水渠统一安排，到年底各项工程同时竣工，1958年春天开始蓄水，很快便发挥了防洪和灌溉的效能。另一个是1953年修建的石塘水库，当年只修好主坝，没有修溢洪道，第二年春季水上涨时，不敢蓄水；后来修起溢洪道，渠道又没修成，这一年，这个水库在防洪和抗旱中都没有起到应有的作用。这一鲜明的对比说明：水利工程必须成套修起，一气呵成，不留尾巴，才能最快地发挥灌溉效益。
    当然，要确保水利建设成套，需要做很多工作。首先在工程布局时要有全局观点，使大中小水利工程与水土保持新工程和原有工程互相配合。在工程铺开时，要正确地估计主观力量和客观条件，并千方百计地确保工程都能按时成套完工。其次，要在较短时间内成套地完成水利建设工程，还必须合理安排劳力，大搞工具改革，提高工程效率。这方面，灰汤公社的一些作法很有参考价值。他们根据主坝、副坝、溢洪道和渠道工程四个方面，灵活地组织劳力，交叉作业，保证了全面开工和将来同时竣工。安东县采取的“能早干，不晚干；能多干，不少干；能今年干，不明年干”的方针也很对。我们必须力争完成一个水利工程就能发挥一个水利工程的效益，将我们宝贵的劳力和财力都用在最有效果的地方，确保我们水利建设的劳动成果在来年的农业生产中发挥作用。
