　　Using Winter Fallow Fields to Cultivate Fertilizer
　　Silk grass is a kind of aquatic plant that grows perennially in lakes and ponds. Common ones include lantern silk, oxtail silk, yellow silk grass, black silk grass, and so on. These silk grasses are a very good kind of natural fertilizer.
　　Planting silk grass in winter water fields can achieve the purpose of using the fields to cultivate fertilizer. The specific method is: during the winter fallow, sow six to seven dan of grass seeds per mu of land. By the time of the next spring plowing, shallow water fields can grow sixty to seventy dan of silk grass per mu, and deep water fields can grow up to one hundred and twenty dan per mu. Before spring plowing, spread eighty jin of lime per mu of field, which can ferment and become fertilizer for the field. This year, the Nanhua Brigade of the Caojun Commune in Huarong County, Hunan Province, used sixty mu of silk grass as fertilizer for a single-season rice field, and achieved a grain yield of 861 jin per mu.
　　This method of using fields to cultivate fertilizer reduces the cost of accumulating fertilizer and saves a lot of labor in transporting fertilizer, which can be described as killing several birds with one stone. (Fang Jihui)

　　利用冬闲田养肥
    丝草是常年蔓生在湖里和塘里的一种水生植物，常见的有灯笼丝、牛尾丝、黄丝草、黑丝草等等。这些丝草是一种很好的自然肥料。
    冬水田栽种丝草，可以达到以田养肥的目的。具体作法是：在冬闲的时候，每亩地撒下六至七担种草，到来年春耕的时候，浅水田每亩可长丝草六、七十担，深水田每亩可长到一百二十担；在春耕以前，每亩田撒石灰八十斤，就可以使其发酵成为本田的肥料。湖南华容县操军公社南华大队用六十亩丝草作肥料的一季稻田，今年亩产粮食八百六十一斤。
    这种以田养肥的办法，降低了积肥的成本，节省了大量运肥的劳力，可谓一举数得。　（方继辉）
