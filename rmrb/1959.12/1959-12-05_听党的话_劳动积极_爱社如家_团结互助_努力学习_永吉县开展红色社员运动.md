Yongji County Launches Red Commune Member Movement

(Our dispatch) The Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jilin Province, in order to further implement the mass line, launched a mass-based Red Commune Member Movement throughout the county, starting from the spring plowing preparations this year. As of October 10th, more than 25,000 Red Commune Members had emerged throughout the county, accounting for 19.2% of the county's rural labor force. Among the Red Commune Members, there are more than 1,400 Red Couples, more than 3,500 Red Commune Member Families, 815 Red Flag Production Teams, 619 Red Flag Production Brigades, and 48 Red Flag Management Areas.

The county's Red Commune Member Movement first started in the Huapichang People's Commune during the spring plowing preparation period this year. Its hallmarks are: adhering to putting politics in command and promoting the communist style. This commune was relatively backward in the past, but since the launch of the Red Commune Member Movement, a leap forward situation has emerged. The county party committee quickly summarized and promoted this experience throughout the county, which was warmly supported by the broad masses. In the early stage of the movement, the conditions for Red Commune Members in various places were not consistent, and the development was not balanced enough. In order to change this situation, the county party committee held three discussions successively, and determined five conditions for Red Commune Members: (1) Listen to the Party and obey the leadership; (2) Work actively and have high attendance; (3) Love the commune like home and cherish public property; (4) Good at unity and mutual assistance; (5) Strive to learn culture and production technology. It was also stipulated that Red Commune Members should be selected by the masses and that the party's class line should be conscientiously implemented. The evaluation time is generally set for the production team to conduct an evaluation once after completing a small segment plan, and the management area and commune evaluate according to the agricultural season. The party committees of each commune have designated a secretary to be responsible for leading the cultivation and inspection of Red Commune Members. Various places have generally implemented cultivation methods such as party members being assigned to individual contracts and absorbing outstanding individuals to attend party lessons. Various communes also conducted collectivism, communism, and class education for Red Commune Members through short-term intensive training. In order to give full play to the role of Red Commune Members, they are generally absorbed to participate in enlarged meetings of the party branch and team committees, so that they can understand the intention of production work and take the lead in completing tasks.

Through the Red Commune Member Movement, the party's mass line has been further implemented, and the ties between the party and the masses have been closely linked. The Chun Deng River Management Area Party Branch of Kouqian People's Commune often learns about the opinions and requirements of the masses through Red Commune Members. During rice transplanting, the second production team did not have enough water, and some commune members reported to the Red Commune Members, hoping to solve it immediately. The Red Commune Members promptly reported the opinions of the masses to the party branch, and the party branch immediately mobilized the commune members to adopt the method of cascading water from the upper reaches, and transplanted all 74 hectares of rice before the summer solstice. This spring, the Lujia Management Area of Wulajie People's Commune was still a weak management area, often relying on external support. Since the party branch cultivated Red Commune Members, the work has greatly changed. After the branch decides on a task, the work is quickly carried out through party members leading Red Commune Members. This year, this management area not only does not need external support, but also supported the Dachang Management Area with seven plows during the spring sowing. The Red Commune Members of the Zhao Jia Youfang Management Area of the Hewanzi People's Commune actively responded to the party branch's call to seize the autumn harvest, and put forward the slogan "Red Commune Members go to the front line, work hard for three days and nights, and guarantee the completion of the harvest," driving the broad masses of commune members to not only complete the harvesting task according to the original plan, but also deep-plowed 72 hectares of land.

Through the Red Commune Member Movement, a large number of activists have also been cultivated and trained, the party and Youth League ranks have been strengthened, and the work outlook of some weak branches has been changed. According to statistics as of October 10th, more than 4,500 red and expert activists have emerged among the Red Commune Members in the county, and more than 1,300 people have been accepted into the party; 1,200 young Red Commune Members have been accepted into the Youth League. In the spring, the Baishi Lazizi Management Area of the Wulihezi People's Commune had only two party members. In the course of carrying out the Red Commune Member Movement, four more party members and ten more Youth League members were developed, enriching the backbone force of the production team. Due to the strengthening of the party's strength in the Liushugou Management Area of the Hewanzi People's Commune, which was relatively backward in the past, the agricultural production competition was in full swing. This year, the total grain output more than doubled, from 580,000 jin in 1958 to 1,310,000 jin.

Due to the in-depth development of the Red Commune Member Movement, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of the county has been unprecedentedly high. After a year of hard work and skillful work, the county overcame the spring drought and other natural disasters, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture. This year, the county's total grain output increased by nearly 20% compared with last year, and the average unit yield increased by 33.1%. 80% of the county's poor management areas have caught up with the wealthy management areas.

    永吉县开展红色社员运动
    本报讯　中共吉林省永吉县委，为了进一步贯彻群众路线，从今春备耕开始，在全县开展了群众性的红色社员运动。到10月10日止，全县已涌现红色社员两万五千多名，占全县农村劳动力的19.2％。红色社员中有红色夫妇一千四百多对，红色社员家庭三千五百多户，红旗生产组八百一十五个，红旗生产队六百一十九个，红旗管理区四十八个。
    这个县的红色社员运动，是今年春天备耕时期，首先在桦皮厂人民公社开展起来的。它的标志是：坚持政治挂帅，发扬共产主义风格。这个公社过去较落后，自从开展红色社员运动后，就出现了跃进局面。县委迅速总结并在全县推广了这个经验，得到广大群众的热烈拥护。运动初期，各地红色社员条件不够一致，发展不够平衡。为了改变这一情况，县委曾先后进行了三次讨论，确定了红色社员的五个条件：（1）听党的话，服从领导；（2）劳动积极，出勤多；（3）爱社如家，爱护公物；（4）团结互助好；（5）努力学习文化和生产技术。并规定红色社员都要经过群众评选，并要认真贯彻党的阶级路线。评比时间，一般规定生产队完成一个小段计划评比一次，管理区和公社按农业季节评比。各公社党委都确定一名书记，负责领导红色社员的培养、考察工作。各地普遍实行了党员分工包干、吸收优秀分子听党课等培养办法。各公社还通过短期集训，对红色社员进行了集体主义、共产主义和阶级教育。为了充分发挥红色社员的作用，一般都吸收他们参加党支部扩大会议和队委会，使他们了解生产工作意图，带头完成任务。
    通过红色社员运动，进一步贯彻了党的群众路线，密切了党与群众的联系。口前人民公社春登河管理区党支部，通过红色社员经常了解群众的意见和要求。在插秧时，第二生产队的水不够，有些社员便向红色社员反映，希望能够立即解决。红色社员及时把群众的意见汇报给党支部，党支部便立即发动社员采取从上水头往下串水的方法，在夏至前把七十四公顷水稻全插上了秧。乌拉街人民公社芦家管理区，今春还是个薄弱管理区，经常靠外边支援。自从党支部把红色社员培养起来之后，工作就大变样了。支部决定一项任务后，通过党员带动红色社员，工作便很快地开展起来。今年这个管理区不但不需要外地支援，春播时还支援了大常管理区七副犁杖。河湾子人民公社赵家油坊管理区的红色社员，积极响应党支部抓紧秋收的号召，提出“红色社员上前线，苦战三昼夜，保证收割完”的口号，带动广大社员，不仅按原计划完成了收割任务，而且还深翻了七十二公顷地。
    通过红色社员运动，还培养和锻炼了大批积极分子，壮大了党、团队伍，改变了一些薄弱支部的工作面貌。到10月10日统计，全县红色社员中，已涌现出四千五百多名红专积极分子，并有一千三百多人被接受入党；一千二百名青年红色社员被接受入团。五里河子人民公社白石砬子管理区，春天只有两名党员，在开展红色社员运动中，又发展了四名党员，十名团员，充实了生产队的骨干力量。河湾子人民公社过去比较落后的柳树沟管理区，由于壮大了党的力量，农业生产竞赛搞的热火朝天，今年粮食总产量翻了一番多，由1958年的五十八万斤，增长到一百三十一万斤。
    由于深入开展了红色社员运动，全县人民革命干劲空前高涨。经过一年来的大干苦干和巧干，战胜了春旱和其他自然灾害，取得了农业空前大丰收。今年全县粮食总产量比去年增产近两成，平均单位产量增产33.1％。全县有80％的穷管理区赶上了富裕管理区。
