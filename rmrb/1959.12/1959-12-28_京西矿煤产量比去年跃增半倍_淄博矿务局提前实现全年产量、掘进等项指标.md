Xinhua News Agency, December 27th:

　　Jingxi Mining Bureau has completed its annual production tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way. The annual coal production plan was completed twelve days ahead of schedule, an increase of 51.29% compared to last year; tunneling footage was completed twenty days ahead of schedule, an increase of 20.53% compared to last year; the total output value plan was completed fourteen days ahead of schedule; pit prop consumption was reduced by 15% compared to the annual plan, and costs were reduced by 2.9%; overall labor efficiency also exceeded the national plan target, an increase of 28% compared to last year.

　　Since the beginning of this year, this mine has adhered to the principle of putting politics in command and engaging in mass movements, resulting in continuous improvement in production. The broad masses of workers fought for a full-attendance, successful start to the year, raising the first quarter's production level by 5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. After August, the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was thoroughly implemented, and production rose steadily. Coal production in September increased by 26.6% compared to August, and in October, November, and the first twenty days of December, it increased by 6.4%, 9.9%, and 0.43% respectively compared to the same period of the previous month.

　　Actively carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and vigorously promoting key advanced experiences, are also important factors in achieving large-scale, high-yield production across the board. The No. 40 Tunneling Team of Mentougou Mine promoted deep-hole blasting and multi-hole circulating operations, increasing daily footage by 52%. Since November, the bureau's six mines have implemented the advanced "four-shift, eight-hour cross-operation" method, making full use of working hours, improving underground management levels, achieving a balance between work and rest, and generally increasing coal mining and tunneling efficiency by more than 10%.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 27th: Zibo Mining Bureau completed its annual national plans for output, tunneling, overall labor efficiency, and unit costs ahead of schedule on the 23rd; the quality of coal meets national requirements.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, Zibo Mining Bureau often uses the methods of great airing of views, great contending, and great debate to organize workers to recall and compare, calculate detailed accounts, and boost their spirits, enabling continuous leaps forward in production. In order to widely mobilize workers to participate in competitions, they adhered to the practice of holding a bureau-wide major appraisal once a month, and at each appraisal meeting, they put forward further requirements for improving production, organized competition between mines, and established collective pacesetters such as the Hongshan No. 54 Coal Mining Team and the Xihe Sun Qiming Tunneling Team, which played a significant role in promoting production.

　　In order to continuously improve the output of mining and tunneling faces and achieve large-scale high yields, Zibo Mining Bureau promoted ninety-one advanced experiences this year, especially focusing on the key to regular circulating operations, promoting advanced experiences such as extended cutting disks and rapid tunneling, achieving good results. After the bureau extended the cutting disks of forty-two coal cutting machines by two to two point eight meters, it effectively increased production. They increased the total length of the cutting disks from seventy-five meters to ninety-four meters, which is equivalent to adding the production capacity of twelve new coal cutting machines.

　　京西矿煤产量比去年跃增半倍
    淄博矿务局提前实现全年产量、掘进等项指标
    据新华社27日讯　京西矿务局已经多快好省地完成全年生产任务。全年煤产量计划提前十二天完成，比去年增长51.29％；掘进进尺提前二十天完成，比去年提高20.53％；提前十四天完成总产值计划；坑木消耗比年度计划降低15％，成本降低2.9％；全员效率也超过国家计划指标，比去年提高28％。
    今年以来，这个矿坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，生产不断提高，广大职工年初就为全勤开门红奋战，使第一季度生产水平比去年第四季度提高了5％。8月份以后，深入贯彻了党的八届八中全会决议，生产节节上升。煤产量9月比8月提高26.6％，10月、11月和12月前二十天，又分别比前一月同期提高6.4％、9.9％和0.43％。
    积极开展技术革新和技术革命运动，狠狠推广关键性先进经验，也是全局取得大面积高额丰产的重要因素。门头沟矿掘进四十队推广了深孔爆破、多孔循环作业，使日进尺提高了52％。11月以来，全局六个矿推行“四班八小时交叉作业”先进操作法，充分利用工时，提高井下管理水平，做到了有劳有逸，采煤和掘进效率一般提高10％以上。
    据新华社济南27日电　淄博矿务局在23日提前完成全年产量、掘进、全员效率及单位成本等国家计划；煤炭的质量合乎国家要求。
    淄博矿务局在党的领导下，经常运用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，组织职工回忆对比，算细账，鼓干劲，使生产持续跃进。为了广泛发动职工参加竞赛，他们坚持一月一次全局大评比的做法，并在每次评比大会上提出进一步提高生产的要求，组织矿与矿之间开展对手竞赛，同时树立了洪山五十四采煤队、西河孙启明掘进队等集体标兵，对推动生产起了很大作用。
    为了不断提高采掘工作面的产量，实现大面积丰产，淄博矿务局今年推广了九十一项先进经验，特别是围绕正规循环作业的关键，推广了加长截盘、快速掘进等先进经验，取得了良好的效果。全局在四十二部截煤机中分别将截盘加长二米至二点八米以后，有效地提高了产量。他们把截盘总长度由七十五米加长到九十四米，相当于增加了十二部新截煤机的生产能力。
