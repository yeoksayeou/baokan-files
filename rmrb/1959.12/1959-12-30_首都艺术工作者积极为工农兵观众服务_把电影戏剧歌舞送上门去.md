　　Capital Art Workers Actively Serve Worker-Peasant-Soldier Audiences
    Bringing Movies, Plays, and Songs and Dances to Their Doorsteps

    (Our Dispatch) Several art groups in the capital, including the Beijing People's Art Theater, the China Youth Art Theater, the China Peking Opera Theater, the China Pingju Theater, the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater, the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, the Central Experimental Opera Theater, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, the Central Song and Dance Ensemble, the Central National Song and Dance Ensemble, the China Acrobatic Troupe, and the General Political Department Cultural Troupe, along with more than 180 suburban film projection teams under the jurisdiction of Beijing Municipality, will, around the New Year, go to various industrial and mining areas, people's communes, military units, schools, and mountainous areas to perform, bringing their programs to the doorsteps of the masses. This is to congratulate the vast number of workers and staff on their early over-fulfillment of this year's production plans, allowing everyone to enjoy the New Year holiday and usher in a "red start" to 1960.

    The film projection teams have prepared programs including four feature films: "The Song of Youth," "Miner's Lamp," "Three Mothers," and "Flying Over Natural Barriers," as well as ten short films such as "Let the Earth Be Landscaped" and "Transforming Nature."

    From New Year's Day until the end of the month, the China Youth Art Theater, in addition to performing the excellent play "Conquering Dragons and Subduing Tigers" at the theater, will take "Family Portrait" and "Intrigue and Love" to factories, villages, military units, and schools in the suburbs, performing at three locations simultaneously in one day.

    The Central Experimental Opera Theater has organized four opera performance teams and a youth dance performance team, which will go to more than 20 units in the suburbs of Beijing, including Changxindian, the Eastern Suburbs, Shijingshan, Fengtai, and Liulihe, to perform for factories and military units. The new programs to be performed include the opera "The New Party Secretary," which praises the disabled veteran Zhang Weiming, who is blind, for returning to his hometown to participate in rural socialist construction and adhering to the Party's stance to resolutely fight against erroneous ideas, as well as the comic opera "Chaoyang Gully," which describes the complex ideological struggle of young intellectuals who participate in agricultural construction in mountainous areas after graduating from school and the new atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward among the people in the mountainous areas. Dance programs include the newly rehearsed small dance drama "Robbing the Bride," which exposes the ugliness and ignorance of the feudal landlord class and praises the wisdom and bravery of the working people, as well as the "Bow and Arrow Dance," which depicts the struggle of Tibetan serfs against serf owners.

    From December 28th to January 3rd, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra will go to Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Power Plant, State Cotton Factory No. 1, Qinghe Woolen Mill, and some military units and schools to perform symphonic music, vocal music, solo singing, and solo instrumental concerts, bringing the art of music to meet more audiences. On New Year's Eve, the symphony orchestra, chorus, solo singing, and solo instrumental groups will go to the Radio Factory, Wire Factory, and Electron Tube Factory to perform, and after the performance, they will have a get-together with the workers to welcome the arrival of the New Year.

    In order to meet the needs of workers and peasant audiences in the capital who love Pingju opera, the China Pingju Theater has newly arranged a batch of plays, including "Meeting at Linjiang," "Mandarin Duck Score," and "Conquering Dragons and Subduing Tigers," which reflects real life, to perform in factories and communes. Some of the plays, such as Zhou Yu and Guan Yu in "Meeting at Linjiang," are appearing on the Pingju stage for the first time.

    电影放映队准备的节目有“青春之歌”、“矿灯”、“三个母亲”、“飞越天险”等四部故事片，“让大地园林化”、“改造自然”等十部短片。
    中国青年艺术剧院从元旦开始一直到月底，除了在剧场公演优秀剧目“降龙伏虎”外，将带着“全家福”和“阴谋与爱情”，分别到郊区的工厂、农村、部队、学校，一天在三个地点同时演出。
    中央实验歌剧院组织了四个歌剧演出队和一个青年舞蹈演出队，将分别到长辛店、东郊、石景山、丰台、琉璃河等京郊工厂、部队二十多个单位演出。演出的新节目有歌颂双目失明的残废军人张伟明回乡参加农村社会主义建设，坚持党的立场，向错误思想进行坚决斗争的歌剧“新来的党委书记”，以及描述青年知识分子从学校毕业后参加山区农业建设的复杂思想斗争，和山区人民在大跃进中的新气象的喜歌剧“朝阳沟”等。舞蹈节目有新近排练的暴露封建地主阶级丑恶、愚昧和歌颂劳动人民智慧和勇敢的小舞剧“抢亲”，以及描写藏族农奴反抗农奴主斗争的“弓箭舞”等。
    中央乐团从本月28日开始到元月3日分别到石景山钢铁厂、发电厂、国棉一厂、清河制呢厂和一些部队、学校演出交响乐、声乐、独唱、独奏音乐会。使音乐这门艺术和更多的听众见面。在除夕晚上，交响乐队、合唱队、独唱独奏小组，将去无线电厂、有线电厂、电子管厂演出，演完后和工人同志联欢，迎接新年的来临。
    中国评剧院为了满足首都爱好评剧的工人、农民观众的需要，新排了一批剧目，有“临江会”、“鸳鸯谱”，和反映现实生活的“降龙伏虎”等，到工厂和公社去演出。其中有的剧目如“临江会”中的周瑜和关羽，在评剧舞台上还是第一次出现。
