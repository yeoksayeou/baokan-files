This newspaper, Taiyuan, 28th: Chao Ying People's Commune in Qixian Town, Taigu County, Shanxi Province, building on the leap forward achieved this year, is forging ahead and has formulated a plan for the continued leap forward in grain, cotton, and oilseed production for 1960.

According to this plan, the average yield per mu of the commune's 40,000 mu of grain fields will reach 1,055 jin, an increase of 67% compared to this year, with the total output increasing by 56% compared to this year. The total output of cotton will increase by 1.6 times compared to this year, and the total output of oil crops will increase by 1.38 times compared to this year. Other vegetables, as well as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, will also see significant development.

Located on the central Shanxi plain, the Chao Ying People's Commune consists of 6,293 households. With its mild climate and fertile soil, it is a good place for growing grain and cotton. This year, they fully exploited the advantages of the People's Commune and achieved an all-round bumper harvest in agricultural production. The average grain yield per mu of the commune reached 630 jin, achieving the production increase target set by the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The yield of ginned cotton per mu was 100 jin, and the yield of oilseed per mu was 204 jin, all of which were one to three times higher than in the bumper year of 1958.

When the commune's Party Committee launched discussions among commune members to formulate next year's production plan, they conscientiously summarized the experience of this year's comprehensive bumper harvests of grain, cotton, and oilseed, as well as many examples of high-yield models. At the same time, they specifically analyzed the various favorable local conditions, criticized some people's "production has reached its peak" arguments, and on the basis of unifying thinking, raising awareness, and strengthening confidence, quickly implemented next year's leap forward plan at the management area, production team, and work group levels. They also formulated solid measures tailored to local conditions to ensure the realization of the plan, and fully implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

The commune first focused on carrying out deep plowing of the land this winter. All 51,294 mu of fallow land in the commune will be deeply plowed, with 70% of the depth reaching more than one chi. On the basis of deep plowing, a professional team of 3,000 people will be organized to carry out garden-style management, striving to achieve high-standard garden-style management of all land before spring planting.

In order to apply more high-quality fertilizer, it was decided to vigorously develop pig farming and manure accumulation, striving to achieve 1.2 pigs per mu and accumulate 6 million dan of fertilizer next year, so that each mu of land will be fertilized with 120 dan of pig manure. At the same time, miscellaneous fertilizer will be accumulated and composted in large quantities, and soil fertilizer will be produced on a large scale, striving to apply 500 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer and 100 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu.

In terms of water conservancy construction, the commune has already installed 116 electric water wheels and plans to dig 100 new wells and build three drainage canals, expanding the irrigated area from 30,000 mu this year to 50,000 mu, realizing land water conservancy and irrigation electrification, and ensuring that all crops are irrigated two to seven times throughout the year. All 5,000 mu of alkaline land that has not been cultivated for many years will be completely improved.

In the discussions, the commune members unanimously agreed that solving the problem of labor shortage was a very important key. Therefore, everyone proposed to use tools to save labor and continue to vigorously carry out tool reform. The commune, relying on its own efforts, established 50 farm implement repair and manufacturing factories, creating, reforming, and imitating 90,000 various tools. Rice milling, flour milling, and forage cutting tools will all be powered; transportation vehicles will be rubber-wheeled and equipped with ball bearings; and all 103 canteens in the commune will be mechanized or semi-mechanized.

Currently, under the slogan of "Turning Winter into Spring, Working Two Years' Worth of Production in One," all commune members have organized four professional teams to start preparing for next year's production in advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, reports: Jiang Xiang Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, on the basis of achieving a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, has recently formulated a plan for continued great leap forward next year. Currently, all cadres and commune members of the commune are making every effort to carry out winter production, actively making various preparations to realize this leap forward plan.

The total output value of agriculture, sideline production, and commune-run industries of Jiang Xiang Commune this year increased by 78.4% compared to the great leap forward year of 1958; among them, grain production increased by 23.7% compared to last year, and oil increased by 6.4 times. With the development of production, the average net income of commune members reached 80 yuan, an increase of 67.3% compared to last year.

In order to continue the leap forward in agriculture and other production next year, the Jiang Xiang Commune Party Committee mobilized and organized cadres and the masses to summarize this year's production experience, and formulated next year's leap forward plan based on this year's experience. This plan requires that the total grain output and unit area yield next year increase by 50% compared to this year; the total oil output next year increase by 1.72 times compared to this year; cotton increase by 2.6 times; pigs increase by 2.7 times; and fresh fish increase by 5 times. Other forestry, vegetables, poultry, and industrial production are all required to have multiple increases. After discussion by the vast number of commune members, everyone believes that there are many favorable conditions for realizing this plan. First, the People's Commune has been consolidated and strengthened after rectification, and its strength has become more abundant. For example, the total public accumulation of the commune has reached 500,000 yuan, which is five times more than last year. Also, all nine poor teams in the commune last year have now caught up with the rich teams after a year of hard work, which has created favorable conditions for the comprehensive high-speed development of production next year. Second, there is a solid material foundation. For example, in terms of water conservancy construction, the Huangdu drainage and irrigation project and a number of ponds have been completed this winter. After the partial dikes are raised and reinforced, the commune has 100,000 mu of farmland that is completely free from the threat of drought and flood and can achieve stable increases in production. Third, the cadres have further improved their leadership methods and working methods, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer. At the same time, inspired by this year's great leap forward, the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members is even higher. Currently, the commune's labor attendance rate reaches 98% every day, and labor efficiency has increased by 20% compared to last year. Fourth, there is great potential for increased production. The commune also has 30,000 mu of low-yield fields, which produced more than 300 jin per mu this year, half as much as ordinary fields. As long as these fields are improved and fertilized, the yield per mu can be greatly increased next year.

Encouraged by this year's bumper harvest, all cadres and commune members of Jiang Xiang Commune are now exerting great energy and vigorously carrying out winter production. After discussing and formulating next year's production plan, more than 2,600 male and female commune members of the Lianwei Management Area went to the mountains to cut grass and leaves to accumulate sufficient fertilizer for early rice next year. So far, they have accumulated more than 3 million dan of fertilizer, averaging more than 200 dan per mu of early rice field. More than 500 cadres and commune members from the Hebian Management Area brought quilts and tools to camp next to the low-yield fields, replacing the bottom soil, accumulating organic fertilizer, and building water conservancy projects for the low-yield fields. Fan Changbing, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, led 10,000 commune members to rush to build the Huangdu drainage and irrigation project and reservoirs. They actively reformed construction tools and operating methods, increasing the average work efficiency from 2 cubic meters last year to 9 cubic meters, greatly accelerating the progress of the project. After a recent period of effort, the commune's winter production has achieved great results, creating favorable conditions for realizing a great leap forward in production next year. For example, the main water conservancy projects have been completed, and more than 90% of the commune's winter water conservancy construction tasks have been completed; 120 dan of farm manure and 30 jin of soil fertilizer have been accumulated for each mu of early rice field next year; and the task of transforming low-yield fields in the commune has been completed 70%; farm tools, plowing cattle, and seeds have all been prepared.

　　昂首阔步进入新的一年　壮志凌云跃向新的高峰
    超英公社蒋巷公社订出明年跃进规划
    本报太原28日电　山西省太谷县祁县镇超英人民公社在今年跃进的基础上，乘风破浪，制订出1960年粮、棉、油料继续跃进的规划。
    根据这个规划，全公社四万亩粮田，平均每亩产量要达到一千零五十五斤，比今年提高67％，总产量比今年提高56％；全社棉花的总产量要比今年提高一点六倍；油料作物总产量比今年提高一点三八倍。其它蔬菜和林、牧、副、渔等生产都要有大量发展。
    位于晋中平原上的超英人民公社，全社共六千二百九十三户。这里气候温和，土质肥沃，是个盛产粮棉的好地方。今年他们充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，农业生产获得了全面大丰收。全社粮食亩产量平均达到了六百三十斤，提前实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的增产指标。棉花亩产皮棉一百斤；油料亩产二百零四斤，这些都比大丰收的1958年提高了一倍到三倍。
    公社党委在发动社员讨论和制订明年生产规划的时候，一面认真总结了全社今年粮、棉、油料全面大丰收和许多高额丰产典型的经验。一面又具体分析了当地各种有利条件，批判了一些人的“生产到顶”论调，在统一思想、提高认识、坚定信心的基础上，使明年的跃进计划很快落实到各管理区、生产队和作业组，并因地制宜地拟定了保证实现计划的扎实措施，全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”。
    公社首先抓紧在今冬大搞深翻土地。全社的五万一千二百九十四亩白茬地，全部进行深翻，其中70％的深度要达到一尺以上。在深翻的基础上组织三千人专业队伍，大搞园田化，争取在春耕下种前使全部土地达到高标准园田化。
    为了增施更多的优质肥料，决定大搞养猪积肥，力争明年实现一亩地有一点二头猪，积肥六百万担，使每亩地增施猪肥一百二十担。同时要大积大沤杂肥，大制土化肥，争取每亩施杂肥五百担，化肥一百斤。
    水利建设方面，全社已经安装好一百一十六台电动水车，还准备新打水井一百眼，修退水渠三条，使水地面积由今年的三万亩扩大到五万亩，实现土地水利化，灌溉电气化，保证所有的农作物全年灌溉二至七次。对多年来不耕种的五千多亩碱化土地，将实行全部改良。
    社员们在讨论中一致认为，解决劳力不足的问题是个很重要的关键，因此，大家提出要向工具要劳力，继续大搞工具改革。公社自力更生，建立农具修配制造工厂五十座，创制、改制、仿制各种工具九万件。碾米、磨面、铡草工具要全部实现动力化，运输车子胶轮化、滚珠轴承化；全社一百零三个食堂要全部实现机械化、半机械化。
    目前全体社员在“化冬为春，一年生产两年闹”的行动口号下，分别组织了四支专业队伍，提前展开明年生产准备工作。
    据新华社南昌电　江西省南昌县蒋巷公社在取得今年农业生产大丰收的基础上，最近又制订了明年继续大跃进的计划。目前全社的干部和社员正在千方百计地进行冬季生产，为实现这个跃进计划积极做好各项准备。
    蒋巷公社今年农业副业和社办工业的总产值比大跃进的1958年增长78.4％；其中粮食产量比去年增长23.7％，油脂增长六点四倍。随着生产发展，社员平均纯收入达八十元，比去年提高67.3％。
    为了明年农业和其他生产继续跃进，中共蒋巷公社党委发动与组织干部群众总结了今年的生产经验，并根据今年的经验制订了明年的跃进计划。这个计划要求明年粮食总产量和单位面积产量比今年增长50％；明年油脂总产量比今年增长一点七二倍；棉花增长二点六倍；猪增加二点七倍；鲜鱼增长五倍。其他林业和蔬菜、家禽以及工业各项生产，都要求有成倍的增长。这个计划经过广大社员的讨论，大家认为实现这个计划具有许多有利条件。首先，人民公社经过整顿更加巩固，力量更加雄厚。例如现在全社公共积累达五十万元，比去年多了五倍。又如，全社去年有九个穷队，经过一年苦战，现在已全部赶上了富队，这就为明年全面高速度发展生产创造了有利条件。其次，有雄厚的物质基础。如水利建设，今冬建成黄渡排灌工程和一批水塘，把部分圩堤加高加固之后，全社有十万亩农田完全解除了旱涝威胁，能够得到稳定的增产。第三，干部进一步改进了领导方法和工作方法，干群关系更加密切；同时广大社员在今年大跃进的鼓舞下，干劲更高，目前全社劳动出勤率天天达到98％，劳动效率比去年提高20％。第四，增产潜力很大。全社还有三万亩低产田，今年亩产三百多斤，比一般田低一半；这些田只要加工加肥，明年亩产量就可大大提高。
    在今年大丰收的鼓舞下，现在蒋巷公社的全体干部和社员正在鼓足冲天干劲，大搞冬季生产。联圩管理区在讨论制定明年生产计划之后，二千六百多名男女社员上山铲草割叶，为明年早稻积造充足肥料，至今已积肥三百多万担，平均每亩早稻田达二百多担。河边管理区五百多名干部、社员带着被子、工具到低产田旁扎营，为低产田换底土、积有机肥和兴修水利。公社党委副书记范长炳带领一万名社员突击修建黄渡排灌工程和水塘水库，他们积极改革施工工具和操作方法，使平均工效由去年二立方米提高到九立方米，成倍地加快了工程进度。经过最近一个时期的努力，现在全公社冬季生产已经取得了巨大成绩，为实现明年生产大跃进创造了良好的条件。例如，主要水利工程已经全部建成，全社冬季水利建设任务已完成了90％以上；已为明年每亩早稻田积造了一百二十担农家肥和三十斤土化肥；全社改造低产田任务已经完成70％；农具、耕牛、种籽都已准备齐全。
