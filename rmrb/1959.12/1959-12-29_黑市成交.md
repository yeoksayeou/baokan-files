　　Black Market Transaction
　　Poem by Chi Bei'ou, Drawing by Fang Cheng
　　Yesterday they were fighting openly and secretly,
　　Today they're as close as brothers.
　　One is modestly yielding his position,
　　The other is cheering for his opponent.
　　Turns out they're making a black market deal,
　　Both sides willing, taking turns as the boss.
　　This time I'll let you go first,
　　Next time he'll be the one to be in charge.
　　This is the "democratic politics" of the United States,
　　More filthy than garbage.

According to Western news agency reports, American monopoly capitalist and Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller issued a statement on the 26th, announcing that he will not participate in next year's American presidential election.

Rockefeller's new decision has caused a sensation in the American press, because his ambition to become the master of the White House is no secret. Many American newspapers have always believed that he is the main opponent of the current Vice President Nixon in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination. There are reports that Rockefeller and Nixon have reached a secret agreement: Rockefeller agreed not to run next year, while Nixon promised to support Rockefeller in the 1964 or 1968 presidential election. A few hours after Rockefeller issued this statement, Nixon immediately issued a statement praising Rockefeller. Nixon's statement said, "Although he (Rockefeller) announced this decision today, he will certainly continue to play a leading role in the Republican Party and the country in the coming years."

　　黑市成交
　　池北偶诗　方成画
　　昨天还在明争暗抢，
　　今天相好有如哥俩。
　　一个把位儿谦让，
　　一个给对手捧场。
　　原来是做成黑市交易，
　　两厢情愿，轮流做庄。
　　这次让你先干，
　　下回由他来当。
　　这就是美国的“民主政治”，
　　比垃圾还脏。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国大垄断资本家、纽约州州长纳尔逊·洛克菲勒26日发表一个声明，宣布他将不参加明年美国总统的竞选。
    洛克菲勒这个新决定在美国报界引起轰动，因为他的想当白宫主人的野心已经不是秘密。许多美国报纸一直认为，他是现任副总统尼克松在争夺共和党总统候选人时的主要对手。有消息说，洛克菲勒同尼克松达成了秘密协议：洛克菲勒同意明年不竞选，而尼克松则答应在1964或1968年的总统选举中支持洛克菲勒出来竞选。在洛克菲勒发表这一声明后几小时，尼克松立刻发表声明赞扬洛克菲勒。尼克松的声明说，“尽管他（洛克菲勒）今天宣布了这个决定，他在今后几年内一定仍将在共和党和国内起领导作用”。（附图片）
