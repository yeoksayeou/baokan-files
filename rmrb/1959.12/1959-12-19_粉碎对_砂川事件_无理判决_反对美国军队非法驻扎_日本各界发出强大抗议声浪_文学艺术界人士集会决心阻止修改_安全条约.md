Xinhua News Agency, December 18th, Tokyo Dispatch: Aoyagi Morio, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, published an article in today's "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, condemning the unreasonable verdict of the Japanese Supreme Court in the "Sunakawa Incident."

The article accused the Supreme Court of deliberately ignoring the aggressive nature of the U.S. military and whitewashing the U.S. military's stationing in Japan.

The article pointed out that the verdict stated that the Japanese Constitution does not deny Japan the right to self-defense, but given that Japan is currently in a state of semi-occupation by and subordination to the United States, this statement is a fallacy to legitimize the "Security Treaty."

The article emphasized that the purpose of the U.S. military stationed in Japan is to launch aggression against the Soviet Union, China, and other Asian countries, and to create a war crisis in the Far East, which is absolutely incompatible with the Japanese Constitution.

The article condemned the Supreme Court for saying in its verdict that the authority to review whether the "Security Treaty" violates the Constitution does not belong to the courts, thus evading its due responsibility, but on the other hand, it contradictorily asserted that the "Security Treaty" does not violate the Constitution. The article pointed out that this proves that the Supreme Court succumbed to the Kishida Nobusuke government.

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th, Tokyo Dispatch: The unreasonable verdict of the Japanese Supreme Court in the "Sunakawa Incident" has aroused angry waves throughout the country.

Akira Kazami, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, said in a statement published in yesterday's "Mainichi Shimbun" evening edition that "the judges who made this verdict do not have the slightest patriotism or morality." He said that this verdict is an acknowledgment that Japan is a U.S. military colony. He emphasized that a nationwide movement must be launched to defend the Constitution and oppose the Supreme Court's verdict.

The Lawyers' Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," composed of 1,500 prominent Japanese jurists and lawyers, issued a statement today protesting the Japanese Supreme Court's unconstitutional and unreasonable verdict in the "Sunakawa Incident." The statement said that at a time when the Japanese and U.S. governments are strengthening their military alliance by revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Supreme Court has made a ruling that turns the Peace Constitution into a scrap of paper, which makes it acutely felt that it is necessary to shoulder the important responsibility of upholding the Constitution.

The "Kyoto Professors' Conference for the Defense of the Constitution," composed of 190 scholars from universities in Kyoto, issued a statement today opposing the Supreme Court's ruling on the "Sunakawa Incident." The statement said that the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan carries the risk of causing war, which is a clear violation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, but the Supreme Court's ruling ignores this point. In addition, the Supreme Court deliberately avoided reviewing whether the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" violates the Constitution, which is a failure to fulfill its duty to protect the Constitution. The Conference decided to send this statement to the Supreme Court, the Diet, and constitutional scholars nationwide.

Takeshi Mano, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, pointed out in today's "Mainichi Shimbun" that the Japanese government is remilitarizing Japan while at the same time distorting the spirit of the Constitution that renounces war. He accused the Supreme Court of colluding with them.

Xinhua News Agency, December 18th, Tokyo Dispatch: One hundred and fifty male and female stage actors in Japan held a conference today to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Prominent actors such as Koreya Senda, Teruko Kishi, Osamu Takizawa, and Yasushi Nagata participated in the conference.

Koreya Senda said at the meeting that revising the "Security Treaty" would further worsen Japan-China relations, and that promoting cultural exchanges between Japan and China is the common wish of the majority of Japanese intellectuals.

He emphasized that Nobusuke Kishi is about to leave for the United States to sign the new "Security Treaty." Japanese male and female actors should now be determined to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Koreya Senda called on the actors present to fight together with the people of the whole country against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

According to a report in today's "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, the Central Standing Committee of the Japan Literary Association, composed of people from Japanese literary circles, issued a statement on the 9th opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty" and demanding the abolition of the existing "Security Treaty."

The statement said that the association not only opposes the revision of the "Security Treaty" but will also stand with literary workers and educators to launch a resolute struggle against all reactionary laws and actions. (Photo attached)

    粉碎对“砂川事件”无理判决　反对美国军队非法驻扎
    日本各界发出强大抗议声浪
    文学艺术界人士集会决心阻止修改“安全条约”
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会委员青柳盛雄今天在“赤旗报”上发表文章，谴责日本最高裁判所对“砂川事件”的无理判决。
    文章指责最高裁判所故意装着看不见美军的侵略性，为美军的驻扎日本搽粉。
    文章指出，判决书说日本宪法没有否定日本拥有自卫权利，但是在目前日本处于美军半占领和从属于美国的情况下，这种说法是为使“安全条约”合法化的谬论。
    文章强调指出，驻日美军的目的在于对苏联、中国和其他亚洲各国发动侵略，并且在远东制造战争危机，这是和日本宪法绝对不相容的。
    文章谴责最高裁判所在判决书中一方面说审查“安全条约”是否违反宪法的权限不属于法院，逃避自己应该承担的责任，但另一方面又自相矛盾地断定“安全条约”不违反宪法。文章指出，这证明最高裁判所是屈从岸信介政府的。
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本最高裁判所对“砂川事件”的无理判决，在全国各地激起了愤怒的声浪。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章昨天在“每日新闻”晚报上发表谈话说，“作出这种判决的裁判官甚至没有丝毫的爱国心和道德。”他说，这个判决是承认日本是美国的军事殖民地。他强调指出，必须开展全国性的运动来保卫宪法，反对最高裁判所的这项判决。
    由日本一千五百名著名法学家和律师组成的阻止修改日美“安全条约”法律家会议今天发表声明，抗议日本最高裁判所对“砂川事件”宣布的违反宪法的无理判决。声明说，当日美两国政府正在通过修改日美“安全条约”来加强军事同盟的时候，最高裁判所作出了使和平宪法变成废纸的判决，这就令人痛切地感到，必须担负起维护宪法的重大责任。
    由京都各大学的学者一百九十人组成的“京都拥护宪法教授恳谈会”今天发表声明，反对最高裁判所对“砂川事件”作出的判决。声明说，美军驻在日本有引起战争的危险，这显然违反日本宪法第九条，但是最高裁判所的判决却无视这一点。另外，最高裁判所故意避免对日美“安全条约”是否违反宪法一事进行审查，这是没有完成它保护宪法的任务的行为。恳谈会决定把这项声明送交最高裁判所、国会和全国的宪法学者。
    最高裁判所前任裁判长真野毅今天在“每日新闻”上指出，日本政府一方面使日本重新军国主义化，同时篡改放弃战争的宪法的精神。他指责最高裁判所同流合污。
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本一百五十位男女舞台演员今天举行大会，反对修改日美“安全条约”。
    参加这次大会的有千田是也、岸辉子、泷泽修和永田靖等著名演员。
    千田是也在会上说，修改“安全条约”以后将进一步使日中关系恶化，而促进日中两国的文化交流是日本大多数知识分子的共同愿望。
    他着重指出，岸信介即将动身去美国签署新的“安全条约”。日本的男女演员现在应当下定决心来反对修改“安全条约”。
    千田是也要求到会的演员同全国人民一道为反对修改“安全条约”而斗争。
    据“赤旗报”今天报道，由日本文学界人士组成的日本文学协会中央常任委员会9日发表声明，反对修改“安全条约”，并且要求废除现存的“安全条约”。
    声明表示，协会不仅反对修改“安全条约”，而且将站在文学工作者和教育工作者的立场同一切反动的法律和行动展开坚决的斗争。（附图片）
