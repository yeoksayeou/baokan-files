　　Fodder Beet
　　Fodder beet, also known as fodder radish, is a high-yielding succulent feed that pigs love to eat. It is widely adaptable and grows in most areas north of the Yangtze River. Generally, each mu can produce around 10,000 jin of beet roots, as well as a large quantity of leaves.

　　Fodder beet is sown from mid-to-late April to early May and harvested before frost. After harvesting, the leaves are trimmed and piled on the ground for two or three days, then stored in a cellar. The leaves can be mixed with rice bran and other materials to make silage. When feeding pigs, first wash the fodder beet with water, chop it into small pieces, and mix it with other feeds.

　　饲料甜菜
    饲料甜菜又叫饲料萝卜，是一种高产的多汁饲料，猪很喜欢吃。它的适应性很广，长江以北广大地区都生长。一般每亩可产块根一万斤上下，还有大量的叶子。
    饲料甜菜在4月中、下旬到5月上旬播种，到霜冻前收获。收获后，削掉叶子，堆在地面，放二、三天，然后入窖贮存。叶子可以与谷糠等混合制作青贮饲料。喂猪时先把饲料甜菜用水洗净，切成碎片，拌合其他饲料喂用。（附图片）
