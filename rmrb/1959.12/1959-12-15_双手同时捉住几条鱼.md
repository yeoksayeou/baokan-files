    The Gushan Commune, making use of every opportunity and skillfully grasping sideline production, has created a model of "halving manpower and doubling income." This is a good experience.
    Currently, rural production is making an all-round great leap forward, and the labor force is strained. How to deal with this issue: is it "both hands can only catch one fish," or "both hands should catch several fish simultaneously"? We advocate "catching several fish with both hands simultaneously." Is it possible? Yes. The facts of the Gushan Commune prove it. They not only calculate the accounts of labor force going to work, but also calculate the accounts of labor potential, calculate the accounts of tool reform, and also calculate the accounts of the favorable conditions of the People's Commune to divide labor and specialize in industries, and arrange labor force more reasonably. In a word, all positive factors that can be mobilized are taken into account. In this way, the more you calculate, the more confident you become, the greater your enthusiasm, and all difficulties are easily solved.
    The experience of the Gushan Commune vividly illustrates that methods are devised by people, and people's wisdom is endless.

    双手同时捉住几条鱼
    谷山公社见缝插针，巧抓副业生产，创造了“用人减半，收入加番”的范例。这是一个好经验。
    当前农村生产全面跃进，劳动力紧张。如何对待这个问题：是“双手只能捉一条鱼”，还是“双手要同时捉几条鱼”？我们是主张“双手同时捉住几条鱼”。能不能做到？能。谷山公社的事实就是证明。他们既算出工的劳动力账，也算劳动潜力账，算工具改革账，也算人民公社能分工分业、更合理地安排劳动力的有利条件账。一句话，把一切可以调动起来的积极因素，通通估计进去。这样，越算信心越足，干劲越大，一切困难，迎刃而解。
    谷山公社的经验，生动地说明了办法是人想出来的，人们的智慧是无穷无尽的。
