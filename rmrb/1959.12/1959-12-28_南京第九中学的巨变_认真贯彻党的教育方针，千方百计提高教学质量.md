　　The Tremendous Change in Nanjing No. 9 Middle School
　　——Conscientiously Implement the Party's Education Policy and Try Every Possible Means to Improve Teaching Quality
　　By Our Correspondent Wei Shun
    Nanjing No. 9 Middle School was formerly the private Hongguang Middle School. This school was controlled by imperialist elements before liberation. When it was taken over in 1951, it had only more than 300 students in 13 classes and 15 teachers. The students' academic performance was very low. In the summer exam of 1951, very few students scored above 80, and the number of students who failed accounted for 26.18% of the total number of students. After the takeover, under the direct leadership of the Party, it developed into 26 classes in 1953, 33 classes in 1955, and 34 classes from 1957 to the present. The number of students increased from more than 300 to more than 1,600, and the number of teachers increased from 15 to 71. The teaching performance has been continuously improving. This year, the number of students with scores above 80 accounts for about 54% of the total number of students. Compared with other schools in the province, this school has risen from the lower reaches to the middle reaches and then to the upper reaches. How did they improve?
    Putting Politics in Command and Establishing Righteousness
    In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the school has focused on improving the quality of teaching. In the past political movements, it has waged resolute and irreconcilable struggles against bourgeois educational viewpoints, bourgeois individualism, and right-leaning conservative ideas. During the Two-Anti and Blooming and Contending campaigns, 30,000 big-character posters were put up to thoroughly expose and criticize the ideas of fame and position, money worship, separation from politics, separation from production, and separation from reality that some teachers promoted in the classroom. After the Party's general line for building socialism and the educational policy of serving politics and combining with productive labor were put forward, a countercurrent once appeared in the school. It was said that "No. 9 Middle School has a weak foundation and poor conditions. The current midstream level, which is not as good as the best but better than the worst, is already good enough"; "Linking language with politics will become dry preaching, and linking mathematics with production will turn textbooks into worker's manuals. Music and sports have their own special laws and cannot be linked with politics," and so on. In response to this situation, the school's Party branch carried out education on the current situation and organized debates on issues such as "Can teaching be done with greater, faster, better, and more economical results?" and "Does everyone have to strive for the upper reaches?" Through the debates, teachers and students understood that only by implementing the Party's education policy can students acquire comprehensive knowledge and cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness. At the same time, they also understood the principle that staying in the middle reaches will inevitably lead to the lower reaches. Therefore, under the slogan of "combining teaching with labor and combining transformation with service," teachers offered suggestions and gifts, and proposed 805 rationalization proposals in two days. They all expressed that they would demand the highest standards from themselves, make the greatest efforts, and try every possible means to improve the quality of teaching. Then, they put down their airs, went out of the school, went to factories and the countryside, and sought treasures and learned from experience, forming a vigorous upsurge of striving for the upper reaches and a hot tide of engaging in teaching.
　　Try Every Possible Means to Improve Teachers' Level
    Among the 71 teachers in this school, only 7 graduated from university and teach their major, accounting for less than 10% of the total number of teachers. Only 6 graduates from two-year colleges, accounting for just over 8%. High school and junior high school graduates account for about 30%. This situation shows that the teaching conditions of No. 9 Middle School are not very good. The Party branch mainly relied on self-reliance and adopted various methods to quickly improve the teaching level of teachers.
    Old teachers guide new teachers, and experienced teachers guide inexperienced teachers. Senior high school teachers attend the lesson preparation of new teachers in junior high school and senior high school classes every week, and introduce where they have encountered problems when giving lectures, which places are difficult for students to understand, and how to give lectures to achieve better results. A senior high school mathematics teacher explains algebra to junior high school teachers for two hours every week, detailing the key points of each chapter, the problems that students may encounter, how to relate to reality, how to break through the key points, and how to grade homework. In this way, the teaching performance of new teachers has improved significantly.
    Excellent teachers are dispersed, and each class has a backbone. In the past, in order to ensure the quality of entrance examinations, the school assigned teachers with higher levels and stronger abilities to each class and subject in the graduating grade. As a result, some teaching problems in most non-graduating classes could not be solved for a long time. Later, it was clarified that improving the quality of teaching is not only for entrance examinations, but also should be paid attention to from the lower grades. More importantly, it is necessary to comprehensively and neatly cultivate laborers with culture and socialist consciousness. Therefore, they distributed the teachers of the graduating class to each grade as the backbone, giving full play to their expertise and driving the whole, so that the entire teaching performance improved neatly.
    Observe each other and exchange experience. At first, some teachers were unwilling to listen to others' lectures, feeling that it was an extra burden. After eliminating the arrogance of "scholars despise each other" and forming an atmosphere of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced, mutual listening to lectures changed from passive to active. By listening to lectures in the classroom, teachers can directly see the demonstrations of others in solving teaching difficulties and key issues, learn from others' strengths, and make up for their own weaknesses. In addition, after observing teaching, the teaching and research department led the evaluation meeting to summarize the advantages and disadvantages. Every period of time, each subject systematically makes special summaries, affirms the practical and feasible experience in teaching, and exchanges and promotes it in a timely manner, so as to achieve mutual promotion and common improvement.
    In addition, methods such as studying theory and systematic further study were also adopted.
    Teaching Combined with Production
    After the central government issued the instruction that education must be combined with productive labor, the school resolutely implemented it. In productive labor, teachers not only transformed their thinking, but also enriched the content of teaching and improved the quality of teaching. For example, in senior high school solid geometry, students always felt that the calculation and use of the lateral area of ​​a truncated cone was empty and useless. When the teacher came back from working in the factory and explained it with the example of the white iron worker cutting the truncated cone-shaped drill bucket material, the students immediately understood its value in production. This kind of teaching from books to practice, and then from practice to books, made many abstract concepts concrete and practical, and easy to grasp. This not only aroused the students' strong desire for knowledge, but also greatly inspired their wisdom. After learning the basic principles of optics in connection with the basic principles of sound film and television broadcasting, they designed photoelectric automatic control, automatic vending, automatic timekeeping and other devices. Through these practices, the knowledge that students have acquired is much more practical and solid. The learning performance of the four classes in the first year of high school, where work-study programs are best carried out, has gradually increased. In the first and second halves of 1958, the number of people with scores above 80 in each subject in their examinations increased.
    Cadres Go Deep into Teaching Practice
    In order to improve the quality of teaching, school leaders painstakingly studied teaching, went deep into reality, and learned while doing. For example, Xu Guang, the secretary of the school's Party branch and vice principal, was not originally engaged in school education work. After arriving at the school, he systematically studied classic works such as "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," various instructions and documents of the central government on education policies, and professional books such as pedagogy, psychology, and teaching methods. After several years of learning while doing, he is now an expert in leading teaching. In the past few years, he and other leaders have divided their work and participated in the main links of teaching such as formulating plans, preparing lessons, and listening to lectures, and they have worked with teachers to eliminate difficulties. School leaders have long adhered to the system of listening to lectures for four hours a week, and after each lecture, they put forward their own opinions to the lecturer. They also regularly check teachers' lesson plans, teaching notes, the number and quality of homework corrections, question recording books, and test papers. After discovering problems, they take methods such as individual conversations, group discussions, and school affairs meetings to solve them. They also regularly convene class representative meetings in batches to collect students' opinions on the teaching of each subject, analyze and study them in a concentrated manner, and then put forward improvement opinions and include them in the next stage of each subject's teaching plan.
    The school has also always implemented the Party's policy towards intellectuals and mobilized the enthusiasm of all teachers. In politics, in the past few years, the school has opened Party classes to educate teachers to use the Party's principles and requirements as the standard for measuring their own progress, so that everyone has clarified the direction. The branch also irregularly holds heart-to-heart talks in batches to listen to their demands, clearly affirm achievements, sincerely point out shortcomings, and enthusiastically put forward hopes, which greatly enhanced the teachers' belief in demanding progress. Everyone was happy and motivated, determined to teach the students better. (Attached picture)

　　南京第九中学的巨变
　　——认真贯彻党的教育方针，千方百计提高教学质量
　　本报记者　韦顺
    南京市第九中学的前身是私立弘光中学。这所学校解放以前为帝国主义分子把持，1951年接管时，十三个班只有三百多名学生和十五名教师。学生学习成绩很低，1951年暑期的考试成绩，八十分以上的寥寥可数，不及格的就占了学生总数的26.18％。接管以后，在党的直接领导下，1953年发展为二十六班，1955年三十三个班，1957年到现在三十四个班，学生人数从三百多人增加到一千六百多人，教师从十五人增加到七十一人；教学成绩不断上升，今年学生考试成绩八十分以上的就占总人数的54％左右。同省内各校比较，这所学校从下游经过中游升到了上游。他们是怎样提高的？
    政治挂帅树正气
    几年来，学校在党的领导下，以提高教学质量为主，在历次政治运动中，与资产阶级教育观点、资产阶级个人主义以及右倾保守思想作了坚决的不调和的斗争。双反鸣放时，曾经贴出三万张大字报，对部分教师在课堂上宣传的名位思想、金钱主义、脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的教学观点，进行了彻底的揭发和批判。当党的建设社会主义的总路线和教育为政治服务、与生产劳动结合的教育方针提出以后，学校里曾经出现了一股逆流。说“九中底子薄，条件差，像目前这样比上不足，比下有余的中游水平已经不错了”；“语文联系政治会变成干枯的说教，数学联系生产，课本就变成了工人手册，音乐体育有自己的特殊规律，不能联系政治”，等等。学校党支部又根据这种情况，进行了当前形势的教育，组织了“教学能否多快好省”、“上游是否人人要争”等问题的辩论。通过辩论，师生们明白了，只有执行党的教育方针，才能使学生获得全面知识，才能培养出有社会主义觉悟的劳动者。同时，也明白了甘居中游，势必落到下游的道理。于是，在“教学与劳动结合，改造与服务结合”的口号下，教师们纷纷交心，献礼，两天内就提出合理化建议八百零五条；都表示要以最高的标准要求自己，要尽最大的努力，千方百计为提高教学质量而努力。接着，他们就放下架子，走出校门，下厂下乡，探宝取经，形成了生气勃勃地争上游，热气腾腾地搞教学的热潮。
　　千方百计提高教师水平
    这个学校七十一位教师中，大学毕业而教本专业的只有七人，占教师总数不到10％，二年制的专科毕业生只六人，占8％多，高中和初中毕业生占30％左右。这种情况说明九中的师资条件并不算好。党支部以自力更生为主，采取了多种多样的办法，迅速提高了教师教学水平。
    以老带新，以熟带生。高三老教师每周都参加初一和高一班新教师的备课，并且介绍自己讲课时，在哪些地方碰过钉子，哪些地方是学生难懂的，怎样讲效果就好，等等。高三的一位数学教师，每周向初中教师讲解两小时代数，详述每一章的关键，学生可能发生的问题，怎样联系实际，突破重点，怎样批改作业等。这样，新教师的教学成绩就显著上升。
    优秀教师分散，班班都有骨干。以往，学校为了保证升学质量，把毕业年级的各班各科，都配上水平较高、能力较强的教师。这样一来，大多数非毕业班教学上的一些问题，就迟迟得不到解决。后来，明确了提高教学质量，不仅是为了升学，而且应该从低年级就注意起，更重要的是要全面整齐地培养有文化的有社会主义觉悟的劳动者。于是，他们就把毕业班的教师分散配备到各个年级去做骨干，发挥专长，带动整体，使整个教学成绩整齐上升。
    相互观摩，交流经验。开始，有些教师不愿听别人讲课，觉得是额外负担。在打掉“文人相轻”的骄气、形成学先进、比先进、超先进的风气以后，相互听课就由被动变为主动。教师在课堂听课，能直观地看到别人解决教学难点和关口问题的演示，取人之长，补己之短。此外，观摩教学以后，教导处又领导开评议会，总结优缺点。每隔一段时间，各科再系统地作专题总结，肯定教学上切实可行的经验，及时交流推广，达到相互促进，共同提高。
    此外，还采取了学习理论、系统进修的办法。
    教学结合生产
    学校在中央关于教育必须结合生产劳动的指示下达以后，坚决贯彻执行。教师在生产劳动中，不仅改造了思想，也丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。如高三立体几何中，学生关于圆台侧面积的计算和用途，一直感到空洞无用。当教师在工厂劳动回来以后，用白铁工人剪回圆台形钻桶料子的实例讲解，学生马上就理解了它在生产上的价值。这种从书本到实践，再从实践到书本的教学，使过去很多抽象的概念具体了、实际了，容易掌握了。这不仅引起学生们的浓厚求知欲，也大大启发了学生们的智慧。他们结合有声电影和电视广播的基本原理学习了光学原理以后，就设计了光电自动控制、自动售货、自动报时等装置。通过这些实践，学生们获得的知识实际、牢固多了。学校勤工俭学开展得最好的高一四个班，学习成绩都逐步上升。他们1958年上半年和下半年的各科考试成绩，八十分以上的人数越来越多。
    干部深入教学实际
    为了提高教学质量，学校领导干部苦心钻研教学，深入实际，边干边学。如学校党支书兼副校长许光，原来不是做学校教育工作的，从到校以后，就有计划地学习了“矛盾论”、“实践论”等经典著作、中央有关教育政策方针的各种指示文件以及教育学、心理学、教学法等业务书籍。经过几年的边干边学，现在已经是个领导教学的内行了。几年来，他和其他领导干部分工参加到制定规划、备课、听课等教学主要环节中，和教师们共同活动，一起排除疑难。学校领导干部长期坚持了每周听课四小时的制度，每次听完课以后向主讲教师提出自己的意见。他们还经常检查教师的教案、教学笔记、批改作业的次数质量、提问记分册和试卷等，发现问题以后，采取个别交谈、小组讨论、校务会议研究等办法解决。他们还定期分批召开课代表会议，收集学生对各科教学的意见，集中分析研究以后，提出改进意见，列入下一段各科教学计划中去。
    学校也始终贯彻了党对知识分子的政策，调动全体教师的积极性。在政治上，几年来，学校开办了党课，教育教师们以党的原则和要求作为衡量自己进步的标准，使大家明确了方向。支部还不定期地分批召开谈心会，听取他们的要求，明确肯定成绩，诚恳指出缺点，热情提出希望，这使教师们大大增强了要求进步的信念，个个心情舒畅，干劲倍增，决心把学生教得更好。（附图片）
