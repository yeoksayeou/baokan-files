Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 15th - The Iraqi "Al-Zaman" newspaper published an editorial today commenting on Eisenhower's eleven-nation tour, stating that Eisenhower's trip was to strengthen aggressive military treaties, especially the former Baghdad Pact. "This makes people all over the world, especially in the Middle East, worried and uneasy about the results of his trip and the consequences of escalating tensions in the region."

    The editorial stated that if the United States truly hopes to ease international tensions, it must abolish those military treaties and blocs. The newspaper also stated that after Eisenhower's foreign visit, the threats and attempts at interference by the Central Treaty Organization member states against peaceful and neutral countries have increased. The newspaper pointed out that the Central Treaty Organization member states view Eisenhower's foreign visit as a request for the United States to provide more "military assistance" and for the United States to formally join the Central Treaty Organization. The editorial stated that all of this is an attempt to strengthen this treaty organization, or, as some politicians in these countries have said, to add "some teeth" to the organization. The newspaper pointed out that "obviously, the only result of this demand will be to intensify the Cold War, continue the arms race, and maintain tensions in the Middle East."

          Cairo "Al Messa"

    The Day the US President Talked About Peace in India
    Was the Time When US Weapons Slaughtered Africans

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 16th - An article published in the Cairo "Al Messa" on December 16th pointed out that almost at the same time that Eisenhower stood in the Indian Parliament calling for peace and condemning aggression, his representative Lodge voted in the United Nations against the draft resolutions proposed by Asian and African countries aimed at stopping the Algerian war and aggression.

    The newspaper said that while Eisenhower was making these high-sounding pronouncements, he was providing weapons to France and other imperialist allies to slaughter the Algerian people and other African people.

    "Al Messa" said that the US attitude is because the United States is ruled by monopoly capital. The newspaper said that US monopoly capital is doing its best to control the economic and political life of the people of Asia and Africa. Lebanese "Al Siyassa" and "Al Nada" The United States Always Stands on the Side of Aggression and Hegemony The Greatest Danger to Arabs Comes from the United States

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 16th - Lebanese newspapers continue to publish articles exposing the US's painstaking efforts to pretend to want peace in order to deceive the people of various countries and cover up its policies of aggression and war.

    "Al Siyassa" published a commentary today saying that although US President Eisenhower, in his statements and speeches during his foreign visit, tried his best to express that the United States intends to adopt new policies in its relations with various countries and will "follow" new methods based on the spirit of peaceful negotiations to solve international problems, the joint statement issued by Eisenhower and the King of Iran exposed Eisenhower's attempt to make people forget the old US policies, which are: continuing to support and rely on military treaties, despite not being able to achieve the purposes and goals of these military treaties.

    The newspaper pointed out that the current US policy is still the old one, "only the methods are different." It also said that this is why, while Eisenhower was talking about "peace," "justice," "democracy," and "freedom from all kinds of hegemony and fear," his representative in the United Nations took a hostile attitude towards the Algerian people.

    The newspaper concluded: "The United States has always been such a country in the past and present: on any occasion, it always stands on the side of aggression and hegemony, and its fate is linked to the fate of imperialism in the world."

    "Al Nada" concretely exposed the consistent anti-peace stance of US imperialism in an editorial entitled "This is America" on the 15th. The editorial pointed out: "The greatest danger threatening the security and independence of the people of all countries, especially the people of our Arab countries, comes from US imperialism and monopoly capital groups, which have consistently obstructed the relaxation of the international situation and undermined peaceful coexistence."

    The editorial said that the United States is still an imperialist country, and now it has only changed its tactics.

    中东舆论评艾森豪威尔的访问
    伊拉克“时代报”艾森豪威尔访问十一国之行是为军事集团添上“牙齿”
    新华社巴格达15日电　伊拉克“时代报”今天发表社论评论艾森豪威尔的访问说，艾森豪威尔的十一国之行，是为了加强侵略性的军事条约，特别是前巴格达条约。“这就使世界各地人民，特别是中东各国人民，对于他此行的结果以及在这个地区加剧紧张局势的后果感到忧虑和不安”。
    社论说，如果美国真正希望缓和国际紧张局势，它就必须废弃那些军事条约和集团。报纸又说，艾森豪威尔出国访问之后，中央条约组织成员国对和平和中立国家的威胁和干涉尝试增加了。报纸指出，中央条约组织成员国把艾森豪威尔的出国访问看作是要求美国提供更多的“军事援助”并且要求美国正式参加中央条约组织。社论说，这都是为了试图加强这个条约组织，或者像这些国家的一些政治家所说的那样，使这个组织添上“一些牙齿”。报纸指出，“显而易见，这种要求的唯一结果将是加剧冷战、继续军备竞赛，同时在中东保持紧张局势”。
          开罗“晚报”
    美国总统在印度大谈和平之日
    正是美国武器屠杀非洲人之时
    新华社开罗16日电　开罗“晚报”16日发表的一篇文章指出，差不多就在艾森豪威尔站在印度议会里要求和平、谴责侵略的同时，他的代表洛奇在联合国里投票反对亚非国家提出的目的在于制止阿尔及利亚战争和侵略的决议草案。
    这家报纸说，就在艾森豪威尔发表这种冠冕堂皇的论调的同时，他向法国和其他帝国主义盟国提供武器，来屠杀阿尔及利亚人民和其他非洲人民。
    “晚报”说，美国的这种态度是由于美国是受垄断资本统治的。报纸说，美国垄断资本正在尽力控制亚非人民的经济生活和政治生活。黎巴嫩“政治报”和“呼声报”美国总是站在侵略和霸道一边阿拉伯人的最大危险来自美国
    新华社贝鲁特16日电　黎巴嫩报纸继续发表文章，揭露美国在费尽心机地伪装要和平，来欺骗各国人民和掩盖它的侵略和战争政策。
    “政治报”今天发表评论说，虽然美国总统艾森豪威尔在出国访问期间发表的声明和演说中，竭力表示美国打算在同各国的关系上采取新的政策，并将“遵循”以和平谈判的精神解决国际问题为基础的新方法，但是，艾森豪威尔和伊朗国王发表的联合声明揭穿了艾森豪威尔企图使人们忘却美国的老一套政策的底，这种政策就是：继续支持和依靠军事条约，尽管没有能够实现这些军事条约的目的和目标。
    这家报纸指出，美国的现行政策还是那老一套，“只是方式方法不同而已”。它又说，这就是为什么在艾森豪威尔高谈“和平”，“正义”，“民主”和“摆脱各种各样的霸道和恐惧”的时候，他在联合国中的代表却对阿尔及利亚人民采取敌对态度。
    这家报纸最后说：“美国在过去和现在始终是这样一个国家：在任何场合，总是站在侵略和霸道一边，它的命运是同世界上的帝国主义的命运联结在一起的。”
    “呼声报”15日在一篇题为“这就是美国”的社论中具体地揭露了美帝国主义一贯反对和平的立场。社论指出：“威胁各国人民，特别是威胁我们阿拉伯国家人民的安全和独立的最大的危险，来自美帝国主义和垄断资本集团，它们一贯阻挠国际局势的缓和、破坏和平共处。”
    社论说，美国仍然是一个帝国主义国家，现在只是在策略上有所改变。
