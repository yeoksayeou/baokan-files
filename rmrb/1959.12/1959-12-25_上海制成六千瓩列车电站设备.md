    Following the successful production of a 2,500 kW train power station by the Baoding Railway Bureau before National Day this year, China's first complete set of 6,000 kW train power station generating equipment, independently designed, has recently been successfully trial-manufactured at the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, Electrical Machinery Factory, and Boiler Factory.
    A train power station is a mobile thermal power plant. Its complete set of generating equipment, such as boilers, steam turbines, generators, various control instruments, switches, and necessary auxiliary parts, are all installed in a dedicated train carriage. In addition to housing this equipment, the carriages must also leave relatively ample space for the driver to operate. Therefore, the design of the complete set of equipment requires compact structure, small external dimensions, and high efficiency. To adapt to variations in climate, coal quality, and water sources, special equipment must also be added, such as anti-freeze heating devices to prevent oil tanks, condensate pumps, etc., from freezing.

    上海制成六千瓩列车电站设备
    继今年国庆前夕保定列车局制成二千五百瓩列车电站之后，我国第一套自行设计的六千瓩列车电站所用成套发电设备，最近又在上海汽轮机厂、电机厂和锅炉厂试制成功。
    列车电站是一座可以移动的火力发电站。它的全套发电设备，如锅炉、汽轮机、发电机、各种控制仪表、开关以及所需辅机部套等全部安装在一列专门的列车车厢内。车厢中除安置这些设备以外，还要留出比较宽裕的地位，以便司机操作。因此，全套设备在设计上要求结构紧凑，外形尺寸小和效率高。为了适应不同的气候、煤质和水源等变化，还要增加一些特殊的设备，如为防止油箱、凝水泵等冻结，增设了防冻加热装置等。
