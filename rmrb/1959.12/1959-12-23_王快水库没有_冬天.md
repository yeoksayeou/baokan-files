Wangkuai Reservoir Has No "Winter"
By our reporters Wang Bingkui and Li Yushan

	Deep winter, with piercing north winds. In this freezing season, we visited one of Hebei Province's six major reservoirs—the Wangkuai Reservoir construction site.

	Everyone Strives to Be the Best

	The car turned a mountain bend and arrived at the terminal station—the Wangkuai Reservoir construction area. We were told that it was still several *li* from the reservoir dam project. However, the roar of machines and the beautiful music from loudspeakers were already faintly audible. Walking along the construction area road, dozens of wide, flat roads were lined with large and small rubber-tired vehicles, fully loaded with mud and sand, rushing towards the dam. Many of the wheels carrying earth were inscribed with various names such as "Sky-Reaching Vehicle," "Cosmic Vehicle," and "Number One Vehicle Under Heaven." A competition to "Learn from Pace-Setters, Catch Up with Pace-Setters, and Surpass Pace-Setters" was underway, and heroes were emerging in large numbers. Guo Lizhu, the "Mountain-Moving King," transported seventy-seven cubic *fang* of stones in a single day. Chu He'ying, a model worker for the entire reservoir, had been working at the construction site since the beginning of the reservoir's construction, pulling carts for three hundred and fifty-seven days, transporting two thousand two hundred and thirteen cubic *fang* of sand, and traveling a total of forty-four thousand two hundred and sixty-eight *li*, averaging one hundred and twenty-four *li* per day. After establishing various model workers at the construction site and launching a vigorous "Learn, Catch Up, and Surpass" campaign, work efficiency significantly improved. In November, the entire construction site overfulfilled the dam construction and stone quarrying tasks by 108%.

	From a distance, the more than 1,000-meter-long reservoir dam in the valley, like a mountain range with its peaks shaved off, stretched across the Sha River—a scourge that had plagued the region for thousands of years. The layers of red and green flags on the dam, like peach and willow trees competing for beauty in early spring, danced in the wind. Standing on the thirty-four-meter-high dam top, we could see for miles around. On the five-*li*-wide and twenty-*li*-long construction site, vehicles and horses bustled about. Teams of young men and women wearing the same clothes, the same hats, and the same scarves were transporting earth to the dam. These were the youth shock brigades, always standing on the most arduous posts. The entire construction site had three hundred and eighty-two shock brigades with various names such as "Red Maidens," "Hundred Tigers," "Iron Maidens," and "Lightning," totaling more than thirty-three thousand people, becoming the locomotives in the reservoir construction project. The Red Maidens shock brigade from Yi County, dressed in red velvet jackets and trousers and light green scarves, resembled blossoming pomegranate flowers. They had created a miracle of transporting earth seven times a day, with each trip carrying 1.5 *fang* of earth, on a road that was twelve *li* long.

	A series of roaring power winches gently pulled strings of earth-filled cars to the top of the dam. The person in charge of the construction site said that this tool for transporting earth to the dam could bring eight earth cars to the top of the dam every minute on the twenty-five-meter-high and one hundred and fifty-meter-slope dam body, increasing efficiency forty times compared to manual labor and saving half the labor force. Thanks to the hard work and ingenuity of the heroes, the number of workers this winter was more than 20% less than the same period last year, while work efficiency increased by 50% compared to the same period last year.

	Let the heroes describe their fighting life in their own words:

	Thousands of troops and horses surge skyward,
	The cold wind is just like an electric fan,
	Heroes are not afraid of the cold weather,
	Wangkuai Reservoir has no winter!

	New City on the Cliffside

	Near the construction site, leaning against the mountain and facing the water, were wide streets—the living area for the migrant workers. On the roads, rows of small white houses were so bright and tidy; the towering Leap Forward Gates further highlighted the unique style of this "new-type small city." Department stores, photo studios, sewing cooperatives, Xinhua bookstores, hospitals, barbershops, and other service industries, as well as small factories such as iron and wood repair shops, were distributed in various corners. People who had finished work and were resting walked into the stores in twos and threes, chatting and laughing, choosing what they liked. Neatly dressed and beautiful girls often went to the photo studio in groups to take a commemorative group photo.

	The streets in the migrant workers' living area were clean, and the walls were full of poems and paintings. Whether on the street or in the courtyard, it was difficult to see a single piece of paper or a weed. Wide couplets were pasted in front of each courtyard. The door of the Hundred Tigers shock brigade in Gaoyang County had the three large characters "Hundred Tigers" written on it. The couplet next to the door read: "Establish lofty ambitions to fight the Sha River, overcome difficulties and conquer nature beyond the set quota." On the walls on both sides of the door were written "Hundred Tigers Pact" and "Six Good Conditions for Young Red Flag Bearers." Facing the door was a screen wall with a list of honors, a martial arts platform, and the Hundred Tigers' plan. Stepping into the dormitory, one immediately felt a warm feeling. Although it was a simple shed, it was very comfortable and pleasant. The four walls were covered with slogans and certificates, and hung with award flags and literacy charts. The bedding on the *kang* (platform bed) was folded neatly. Everyone had two sets of bedding, and most were brand-new floral quilts.

	Mealtime was approaching, and the cafeteria was emitting a tempting aroma. We visited two migrant worker cafeterias in Wu Renqiao Commune, Anguo County. The cooks in one cafeteria were frying fried dough sticks and making vegetable soup. The menu for the week on the wall listed the varieties of staple and non-staple foods for each day. Manager Li Shaoxian said that there were seven kinds of staple foods each week, rotated, and the coarse grains were processed finely; there were more than forty kinds of non-staple foods, with two dishes per meal, so that the migrant workers could eat their fill and eat well. Not far away, the Shili Xiang Cafeteria was making steamed buns with white flour and cabbage filling and millet porridge, plus two other dishes. The cooks insisted that we taste them. Tasting the flavors, the food was indeed palatable. The person in charge of the construction site said that all cafeterias on the entire construction site had diversified their food, without repeating meals every three to five days, with porridge and dry food for each meal, two dishes and a soup, so that each migrant worker could eat more than one *jin* of vegetables per day. To better improve the migrant workers' diet, the cafeterias also raised their own pigs and sheep. The construction site cafeterias in Anguo County alone raised more than three hundred pigs and more than two hundred sheep. The migrant workers praised the cafeteria, saying: Three major changes a day, better than a big restaurant.

	From Fighters to Cultural Soldiers

	The construction site is lively,
	The combination of work and rest is really good.
	Building the dam while singing,
	The singing echoes halfway up the mountain.

	This folk song is a true reflection of the Wangkuai Reservoir construction site. The entire construction site had entertainment activities on the construction site and movies and dramas in the living area. Whether day or night, walking into the construction site, you could see the girls and young men who had just put down their tools during their shift breaks singing their own songs, performing a few sections of *kuaiban* (clapper talk) or *dagu shu* (drum ballad) praising good people and good deeds. When the lights came on, in the various simple theaters in the construction site's residential area, you could see wonderful programs full of life interest. According to statistics, the reservoir construction site had twenty-five good amateur cultural and artistic troupes and one hundred and twenty-one singing teams. The migrant workers themselves created three hundred and twenty-six scripts such as "Husband and Wife Cart," "Unstoppable Bride," and "Double Happiness"; more than two thousand five hundred *kuaiban* and ballad programs such as "Sha River Hazard" and "Reciting Chu He'ying"; six hundred and seventeen songs such as "Sha River Chorus" and "Singing Wangkuai Reservoir"; and forty-six dances such as "Climbing Dance." These programs were all selected from materials in the life of the construction site, rich, colorful, lively and interesting. There were also many kinds of dramas, including *bangzi*, *pingju*, old tunes, *haha qiang*, and opera small concerts. The migrant workers also created more than 52,000 poems.

	Red and Expert School

	Walking into the construction site, whether on the dam top, in the earth area, or by the side of the road, you could see small blackboards with the text of literacy lessons written on them. During rest, you could see young girls, young men, and middle-aged migrant workers reading textbooks, taking notes, and some gathering together to read newspapers. The more than thirty girls in the "San Lan" shock brigade now know more than seven hundred characters and can read popular publications and newspapers. All communes with migrant worker groups on the construction site have established Party schools, Youth League schools, and spare-time cultural schools on the construction site. More than 22,000 migrant workers are studying in spare-time elementary and higher elementary schools; more than 4,300 people are studying in spare-time middle schools; plus the migrant workers learning to read and write, a total of more than 52,000 people, accounting for 87% of the total number of migrant workers.

	In the past year, this reservoir construction site has also trained a large number of technical talents. According to the person in charge, three hundred and twenty-eight car drivers, two hundred and forty-six tractor drivers, one hundred and four electricians, one hundred and thirty pneumatic drill operators, two hundred and fifty-nine engineering technicians, and more than two thousand five hundred winch operators, iron and woodworkers, etc. have been trained.

　　王快水库没有“冬天”
　　本报记者　王炳奎、李玉山
    数九隆冬，北风凛冽。在这天寒地冻的季节里，我们访问了河北省六大水库之一——王快水库工地。
    人人争上游
    汽车转过山湾，就到了终点站——王快水库工区。听人说，这里距水库大坝工程还有十数华里。但机器轰鸣声，扩音器传出的优美音乐声，已隐约可闻。沿着工区马路走去，数十条宽坦的大路上，大小胶轮车，成行列队，满载泥沙，向大坝涌去。运土的车轮，不少写着“摩天车”，
  “宇宙车”，“天下第一车”等多种多样的名称。这里正开展着“学标兵、赶标兵、超标兵”竞赛，英雄辈出。搬山大王郭立柱，日运石头七十七方。全库标兵楚贺英，从建库开始来工地后，已拉车三百五十七天，运沙二千二百一十三方，往返行程四万四千二百六十八里，平均每日行程一百二十四里。工地树立各种标兵，展开了热火朝天的“学、赶、超”运动后，工作效率显著提高。11月份，全工地超额完成了筑坝开石任务的108％。
    远远望去，山谷中一千多米长的水库大坝，像削去峰顶的山岭，横亘在沙河——这条为害数千年的孽龙身上。坝身上层层列列的红绿旗帜，如初春斗艳的桃柳，迎风起舞。登上高达三十四米的坝顶，极目四望，在宽五里、长二十里的工地上，车水马龙，熙熙攘攘。一队队穿戴着一样服装、一样帽子、围着一色围巾的小伙子和姑娘们，正在运土上坝。这是永远站在最艰巨岗位上的青年突击队。全工地共有“红姑娘”、“百虎将”、“钢铁姑娘”、“闪电”等多种名称的突击队三百八十二个，共三万三千多人，成为建库工程中的火车头。易县的红姑娘突击队，一色的红绒衣裤，浅绿色围巾，像朵朵盛开的石榴花。她们曾在运距十二华里的道路上，创造了日运土七趟，每趟运土一点五方的奇迹。
    一台台吼叫着的动力卷扬牵引机，将一串串的土车，轻轻地带上坝顶。工地负责人说，这种运土上坝工具，在直高二十五米、坡程一百五十米的坝身上，每分钟能把八辆土车带上坝顶，比人力提高效率四十倍，并可节省一半劳力。由于英雄们实干巧干，今冬施工人数比去年同期减少了20％多，而工效却比去年同期提高50％。
    还是用英雄们自己的话描述他们的战斗生活吧：
    千军万马劲冲天，
    寒风只当电扇搧，
    英雄不怕天气冷，
    王快水库没冬天！
    崖畔新城
    工地近旁，依山面水，一条条宽敞大街，这便是民工们的住区。马路上，一排排白色的小房，那么明洁整齐；林立的跃进门，更显出这座“新型小城”的独特风格。百货商店、照像馆、缝纫社、新华书店、医院、理发所等服务行业，以及铁木修配厂等小型工厂，分布在各个角落。下班休息的人们，三三两两，说笑着走进商店，选购自己中意的东西。打扮得整齐漂亮的姑娘们，经常一伙伙走进照像馆，拍上一张合影纪念像。
    民工住区的街道上，房洁地净，诗画满墙。无论在街上或院内，很难看到一片纸屑、一根杂草。每座院落的门前，都贴着宽幅对联。高阳县百虎将突击队的门上，写着“百虎将”三个大字。门旁的对联是：“树雄心立大志向沙河开战，超定额破难关征服大自然”。门两边的墙上，写着“百虎将公约”和“青年红旗手六好条件”。迎门影壁上，是光荣榜、比武台和百虎将的计划。走进宿舍，立刻给人一种暖洋洋的感觉。虽然是简易工棚，但非常舒适宜人。四面墙上，贴着标语、奖状，挂着奖旗和识字牌。炕上的被褥，折叠得整整齐齐。每人都是两套被褥，而且多是崭新的花被。
    吃饭时间快到了，食堂里散发出诱人的香味。我们参观了安国县伍仁桥公社两个民工食堂。一个食堂的炊事员们正在炸油条、做菜汤。墙上的一周饭谱上，写着每天主副食的品种。管理员李绍先说，每周的主食有七种，轮换着吃，并且粗粮细做；副食的花样有四十多种，每餐两个菜，让民工们吃饱吃好。相隔不远的十里香食堂，做的是白面皮白菜馅的包子和小米稀饭，另外还有两个菜。炊事员一定让我们尝尝。品品滋味，饭菜果然适口。工地负责同志说，全工地各个食堂都做到了饭菜多样化，三五天不吃重样饭，每顿饭有稀有干，两菜一汤，每个民工每天能吃到一斤多菜。为了更好地改善民工伙食，食堂还有自养自食的猪羊。仅安国县的工地食堂，就养了三百多头猪，二百多只羊。民工们称赞食堂说：一天三大变，赛过大饭店。
    从战斗员到文艺兵
    工地上，好热闹，
    劳逸结合真正好。
    一面筑坝一面唱，
    歌声震荡半山腰。
    这首民歌，正是王快水库工地的真实写照。整个工地做到了工地有文娱活动，住区有电影、戏剧。无论是白天或深夜，走进工地，可以看到那些轮班休息刚刚放下工具的姑娘和小伙子们，唱起自编的歌子，演唱几段表扬好人好事的快板或大鼓书。当电灯亮起来以后，在工地住区的各个简易剧场里，又可看到富有生活情趣的精彩节目。据统计，水库工地有较好的业余文工团二十五个，歌咏队一百二十一个。民工们自己创作了“夫妻车”、“关不住的新娘子”、“双喜临门”等剧本三百二十六个；“沙河害”、“说唱楚贺英”等快板和曲艺节目二千五百多个；“沙河大合唱”、“歌唱王快水库”等歌曲六百一十七个；“爬坡舞”等舞蹈四十六个。这些节目，都是从工地生活中选取的题材，丰富多彩，生动有趣。剧种更是多种多样，有梆子、评剧、老调、哈哈腔、歌剧小演唱等。民工们并创作诗歌五万二千多首。
    红专学校
    走进工地，无论是坝顶上、土区里、大路旁，都能看到一块块的小黑板，上面写着识字课的课文。休息的时候，又会看到年青的姑娘、小伙子和壮年民工们，在看课本，记笔记，也有的凑在一起读着报。“三兰”突击队的三十多名姑娘，现在都认识了七百多字，能看通俗的刊物和报纸了。工地上凡有民工团的公社，都在工地建立了党校、团校和业余文化学校。已有两万二千多名民工在业余初小和高小学习；四千三百多人在业余中学学习；加上扫盲学习的民工，共五万二千多人，占民工总数的87％。
    一年来，这个水库工地还培养出大批技术人材。据负责同志说，已培养出汽车司机三百二十八名，拖拉机手二百四十六名，电工一百零四名，风钻手一百三十名，工程技术人员二百五十九名，以及卷扬机手、铁木工等二千五百多名。
