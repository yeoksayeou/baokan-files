    Chlorella - Can Be Used as Concentrated Feed
    Zhejiang Successfully Cultivates with Human Manure as Substitute for Chemical Fertilizer
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Wenzhou Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute in Zhejiang Province has successfully cultivated chlorella using human manure instead of chemical fertilizer, opening up a new avenue for solving the problem of concentrated feed for livestock. Currently, over 300 pigs at the institute's livestock farm are generally fed with chlorella and green fodder.
    Chlorella is a lower plant with extremely rich nutrition. It can be cultivated wherever there is river water. It reproduces quickly and has a high yield. The Wenzhou Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute once conducted an experiment. Feeding pigs with one jin of concentrated chlorella can increase their weight by 0.95 jin per day. Using it to feed cattle, chickens, rabbits, etc., also resulted in significant weight gain, with the effect equivalent to two jin of bean cake.
    According to tests, chlorella also contains various organic acids and rich amounts of iron, copper, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, and other elements, which can treat enteritis and rheumatism in livestock. In the past, chemical fertilizers were mostly used for chlorella cultivation. After repeated experiments, the Wenzhou Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute used diluted human manure instead, greatly reducing costs.

    小球藻——可作精饲料
    浙江用人粪尿代化肥培养成功据
    新华社讯　浙江省温州专区农业科学研究所用人粪尿代替化学肥料培养小球藻成功，为解决家畜精饲料开辟了一条途径。目前该所牲畜场的三百多头猪已普遍用小球藻和青饲料喂养。
    小球藻是一种营养极为丰富的低等植物，有河水的地方都可以养殖，繁殖快，产量高。温州专区农科所曾做过试验，用一斤浓缩小球藻喂猪，每日体重可增加点九五斤；用来喂牛、鸡、兔等，体重也都有显著增加，效果相当于二斤豆饼。
    根据化验，小球藻还含有多种有机酸和丰富的铁、铜、钴、锰、钼等成分，可以治疗家畜肠炎和风湿症。过去养殖小球藻多施用化学肥料，温州专区农科所经过多次试验用稀释的人粪尿代替，成本大大降低。
