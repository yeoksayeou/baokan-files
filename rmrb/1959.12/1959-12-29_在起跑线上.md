On the Starting Line
By our reporter

    The capital's workers, having reached the 1959 finish line ahead of schedule, are seizing every precious moment at the end of the year, preparing their saddles and horses, and storing up provisions, so that they can begin the new year with a high-speed leap forward, sprinting towards even greater goals.

    "Warhorses" Awaiting Dispatch

    The repair workers at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant are working day and night to "cure" the "illnesses" of the machines.

    How to process large components in a timely manner is the key to the factory's continued leap forward in production next year. The air hammer in the forging workshop, which processes large components, happened to break down. It usually takes a month to repair, but with the New Year approaching, what could be done?

    Jin Lishuan, a Communist Youth League member leading ten young workers, formed a shock brigade and bravely took on the task. They told the workers operating the air hammer, "Don't worry, we guarantee it will be repaired before the New Year, and it won't affect your 'good start'!"

    The shock brigade divided into two shifts, repairing the machine day and night. The large air hammer was close to the workshop's passage, and the north wind howled through here, making the work area very cold. The young men and women ignored the severe cold, wearing greasy work clothes, some climbing to the top of the air hammer to work, some scrubbing parts, and some repairing crankshafts. Sweat soaked everyone's underwear. Jin Lishuan worked and encouraged everyone, "Work harder! We must not delay the 'good start' in production!" These young people always had to be urged by the team leader to leave when it was time to get off work. And the team leader himself, in order to do more work, slept in his clothes on the chair in the workshop foreman's office for three nights.

    With the support of various departments, the work proceeded at an extraordinary speed. The valve on the cylinder was not suitable, so they immediately took it off and went to find fitter Yang Qin to process it. Everyone knew the serious significance of the air hammer to the factory's production, so Yang Qin did not hesitate at all, immediately removing the welding rods he was processing from the lathe and replacing them with the valve. Many types of workers, like Yang Qin, fully supported the air hammer repair, responding to every request. Now the air hammer has been assembled and is just waiting for the hammer test.

    This large machine tool plant, which mainly produces universal milling machines, has more than six hundred pieces of equipment, all of which have undergone a "health check" by the workers. Most of the defective machines have been repaired. In the tall and spacious workshops, each piece of equipment is wiped clean and shiny, like a warhorse ready to be dispatched.

    "Grain and Grass" Ready

    Good news frequently came from the sales department of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory: Purchasing personnel in Xinjiang sent a telegram saying that the mica sheets allocated to them by the state have been shipped; the purchasing group stationed in Shanghai made a long-distance telephone report, stating that part of the raw materials jointly processed by several brother factories in Shanghai have been completed... The warehouse staff of this factory are busy receiving batches of materials brought into the factory, and the transport workers quickly distribute them to various production workshops.

    The factory needs more than 10,000 kinds of raw materials for production, and there are more than 1,700 kinds of key raw materials needed for the first quarter of next year alone. To prepare these materials in a timely manner, purchasing personnel are rushing around, running to more than a dozen provinces and cities across the country. Purchasing agent Yang Yongliang and other purchasing personnel traveled to Beijing, Shanghai, and the Northeast for a long time to find a certain material, but to no avail. Yang Yongliang thought: "We must find it no matter what, how can we affect the 'good start' in production next year?" An idea appeared in his mind: if we can't buy ready-made ones, can we find a way to manufacture them? Hearing that a research institute in Beijing could manufacture it, he immediately went to the door. The engineers at the research institute were very supportive, but a new problem arose: how can we manufacture it without a sample? A comrade from the research institute told him that an instrument factory in Beijing had this thing. Upon hearing this news, Yang Yongliang did not hesitate to rush to this factory. Finally, he managed to manufacture this thing.

    Now, most of the key materials needed for the factory's production in the first quarter of next year have been prepared.

    Learning Skills, Large-Scale Military Training

    The production plan for the first quarter of next year has been fully distributed to the groups of the Xuanwu Electric Motor Factory. The workers in the milling and planing group have set ambitious goals and proposed a leap forward plan that is several times higher than the assigned plan, reaching a production level of processing eighty electric motor components per day.

    How to achieve this leap forward plan? There are sixteen workers in this group, fifteen of whom are apprentices who have been in the factory for only about a year. Under the leadership of the master workers and the Communist Youth League organization, these young men and women decided to learn technology, practice skills, overcome weaknesses, leverage strengths, and engage in technological innovation to achieve continued leap forward. Therefore, a large-scale technical training activity was quickly launched in this group.

    Diligent study and hard practice became the "motto" of these young apprentices, and they were unwilling to let go of even a minute or a second of time. Master Zhang Qin, the group leader who had just returned from "learning" from the Dalian Electric Motor Factory and the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, would open the book introducing advanced tools during breaks and give technical lessons to everyone next to the machine tool. The workers surrounded him, listening attentively, some taking notes carefully, some raising difficult problems encountered in production, and some experimenting on the machine tool afterward. Wei Shouxian worked hard day and night thinking about how to speed up the processing time of electric motor components. He found that the poor grinding of tools was a key issue affecting labor efficiency, so he carefully learned the master workers' grinding methods while experimenting with scrap iron, and quickly learned to grind and use several advanced tools such as "template knives," increasing production efficiency by two or three times.

    Through constant hard work, most of the workers, like Wei Shouxian, rapidly improved their skills. Apprentice Zhao Guangliang also learned to use powerful planing tools, increasing the daily output of electric motor bases from thirteen to forty. After Zhang Yanhua, Guo Song, and others used the three-sided alloy steel milling cutter created by Zhang Qin, the daily output of shaft keys increased from thirty to one hundred and thirty, an increase of more than three times.

    "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it." As a result of the large-scale technical training, the daily output of the main components of electric motors processed by this group has already reached the requirements of the next year's leap forward plan by half ahead of schedule.

    Launched a "Vanguard Battle"

    "Achieve agricultural mechanization!" This call from the Party Central Committee excited every employee of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, and they regarded this call as their most glorious responsibility.

    Now, the task of trial manufacturing an important new product—a new type of diesel engine—has indeed fallen on their shoulders. This new type of diesel engine can be assembled with combine harvesters and can also be used as power for power generation and irrigation. Compared with other diesel engines of the same horsepower, it saves both steel and fuel. It is a very practical agricultural machine and will be put into mass production next year. To successfully trial-manufacture it as soon as possible and prepare for mass production next year, all the fitters, lathe operators, and milling operators in the factory's engine workshop are launching a lively one-dragon competition in a joyful atmosphere.

    The competition started with manufacturing the heart of the diesel engine—the crankshaft. The first process of this crankshaft is to be processed with a ten-ton die-forging hammer, but there is no such equipment in the workshop.

    "Process it with a lathe!" This suggestion from the workers and technicians was immediately supported by the leading cadres. Lathe operator Cui Shuqiang and several workers lifted a 250-kilogram steel bar onto the lathe, changed the tools, and turned on the switch. The machine started spinning, and the flat square steel bar quickly showed the outline of the crankshaft. The first hurdle was thus broken.

    Each process in this workshop has opened a "green light" for the trial production of this new product. Wherever the crankshaft components go, they are immediately processed without stopping for a moment. Milling group leader Liu Yintang and the technician studied the operation method of replacing planing with milling. Before the components reached the hands of the planing worker, Liu Yintang took them to his milling machine, increasing the efficiency by more than two times, and allowing the crankshaft components to reach the fitters ahead of schedule. Fitter Wang Zhiming operated the drilling machine with all his energy, quickly completing the most critical processing step of this component.

    This "vanguard battle" was very loud: the main components of the new type of diesel engine have now been made and are starting to be installed in a tense manner.

　　在起跑线上
　　本报记者
    提前到达1959年终点的首都工人，正抓紧年末一刻千金的宝贵时光，整鞍备马，积草囤粮，好在明年一开始就高速跃进，向更伟大的目标飞奔。
    “战马”待征
    北京第一机床厂的检修工人，在日夜突击为有“病”的机器“治病”。
    如何把大部件及时加工出来，是这个工厂明年生产继续跃进的关键问题。锻工车间加工大部件的气锤，这时偏偏有一台出了毛病，通常要一个月才能修好，可是快过年了，怎么办呢？
    检修工人共青团员晋立拴带领十个青年工人组成了突击队，勇敢地承担了这项任务，他们给操纵这台气锤的工人说：“放心吧，保证年前修好，不影响你们‘开门红’！”
    突击队分成两班，日夜不停地进行检修。大气锤靠近车间的通道，北风呼啸着从这里吹过，工作场地非常冷。小伙子和姑娘们不顾严寒，穿着油污的工作服，有的爬在气锤的高处工作，有的擦洗零件，有的修配曲轴，汗水浸湿了每个人的内衣。晋立拴一边干，一边鼓励大家：“加油干啊！千万不能耽误生产开门红！”这伙年青人，每天到了下班的时候，总要队长催着才走。而这位队长自己，为了多干活，却有三个夜晚和衣睡在车间工长办公室的椅子上。
    在各部门的支持下，工作以不平常的速度进行着。汽缸上的瓦拉不合适，他们马上拿下来去找钳工杨勤加工，谁都知道气锤对全厂生产的严重意义，杨勤一点也没有迟疑，立即把正在加工的焊条从床子上卸下来，换上了瓦拉。很多工种的工人都像杨勤一样，全力支援气锤抢修，有求必应。现在气锤已经组装完毕，只等着开锤试验了。
    这个主要生产万能铣床的大型机床厂，共有六百多台设备，都已普遍经过工人们的“健康检查”，其中有缺陷的机器，绝大部分已经检修完毕。一幢幢高大宽敞的车间里，每台设备都擦得亮晶晶的，好像一匹即将出征的战马。
   “粮草”齐备
    北京电子管厂供销科里喜报频传：在新疆的采购人员拍来电报说，国家分配给他们的云母片已经起运；驻上海的采购组打来长途电话报告，由上海几个兄弟工厂协作加工的一部分原材料已经完成……这个厂的仓库工作人员忙着接收一批批运进厂来的材料，运输工人又很快地把它们分送到各个生产车间。
    这个厂生产需要的原材料共有一万多种，单是明年第一季度生产需要的关键性原材料就有一千七百多种。为了及时准备好这些材料，采购人员到处奔忙，跑了全国十多个省市。采购员杨永亮和其他采购人员为了找到一种材料，在北京、上海和东北奔波了好久也没有结果。杨永亮想：“无论如何也要找到它，影响明年生产‘开门红’怎么能行？”一个念头在他脑子里出现：如果买不到现成的，能不能想法制造呢？听说北京有个研究所会制造，他就立即找上门去。研究所的工程师很支持他，可是又出现了新的问题：没有样品又怎么制造呢？研究所同志告诉他说，北京有个仪器厂有这种东西。听了这个消息，杨永亮毫不迟疑地赶到这个工厂。最后，终于把这种东西制造出来了。
    现在，这个厂明年第一季度生产需用的关键材料绝大部分已经备齐。
    学本领　大练兵
    宣武电机厂明年第一季度的生产计划已经全部下达到小组。铣刨小组的工人们立下了雄心大志，又提出了一个比下达计划高出好几倍的跃进计划，达到每日加工八十台电动机部件的生产水平。
    怎样实现这个跃进计划呢？这个组有十六名工人，其中有十五人是进厂不过一年左右的徒工。在老师傅和共青团组织的领导下，这群小伙子和姑娘们，决定学技术，练本领，克服所短，发挥所长，闹技术革新，实现继续跃进。于是，一个技术大练兵活动很快就在这个小组开展起来了。
    勤学苦练成为这批青年徒工的“座右铭”，他们一分一秒的时间也不肯轻易放过。刚刚从大连电机厂、北京第二机床厂“取经”回来的小组长张勤师傅，一到休息时间，就打开介绍先进刀具的书，在机床旁边给大家讲起技术课来。工人们围着他，专注地倾听着，有的认真地做笔记，有的提出了生产上遇到的疑难问题，有的过后就在机床上试验起来。魏守先日夜苦思着怎样把电动机部件的加工时间加快。他发现刀具磨不好是影响劳动效率的一个关键问题，就一面细心学习老师傅的磨制方法，一面找废铁试验，很快就学会了磨制和使用“样板刀”等几种先进工具，使生产效率提高两、三倍。
    通过不断的刻苦学习，绝大部分工人都和魏守先一样，迅速提高了技术。徒工赵广亮也学会了使用强力刨刀，使电动机底座由日产十三台猛增到四十台。张彦华、郭松等使用张勤创造的三面合金钢铣刀后，轴键日产量就由三十根提高到一百三十根，增加了三倍多。
    “世上无难事，只怕有心人”，技术大练兵的结果，这个小组加工电动机主要部件的日产量，目前已经有一半提前达到明年跃进计划的要求了。
    打响了“前哨战”
    “实现农业机械化！”党中央的这个号召激动着北京农业机械厂每个职工的心，他们把这个号召看做是自己最光荣的责任。
    现在，一种重要的新产品——新型柴油发动机的试制任务，果然落到他们的肩上了。这种新型柴油机可以装配联合收割机，又可以作为发电、灌溉的动力，和同等马力的其他柴油机相比，既省钢材又省油，是一种很实用的农业机械，明年就要成批投入生产。为了把它早日试制成功，给明年成批生产作好准备，这个工厂发动机车间的全体钳工、车工、铣工，在喜气洋洋的气氛中，开展着热火朝天的一条龙竞赛。
    竞赛是从制造柴油机的心脏——曲轴开始的。这种曲轴的第一道工序要用十吨模锻锤加工，可是车间里没有这种设备。
    “用车床加工！”工人和技术人员的这项建议，立刻得到了领导干部的支持。车工崔书强和几个工人一起，把二百五十公斤的钢棍抬上车床，换了刀具，一扳开关，机关飞转起来，扁方形的钢条很快显出了曲轴的轮廓，第一道难关就这样被打破了。
    这个车间的各个工序都为这项新产品的试制工作打开了“绿灯”，曲轴部件到了哪里，哪里便一刻也不停留地马上为它加工。铣工组长刘印堂和技术员一起研究了用铣代刨的操作方法，部件还没到刨工手里，刘印堂就把它拿到自己的铣床上来了，比刨效率提高两倍多，使曲轴部件提前到了钳工手里。钳工王志明用全副精力，操纵着钻床，很快完成了这个部件最关键的一道加工工序。
    这个“前哨战”打得很响：现在新型柴油发动机的主要部件已经做好，并且开始在紧张地进行安装了。
