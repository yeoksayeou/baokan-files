Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 5th. According to a report by the Polish Press Agency: The Polish Ambassador to the United States has protested to the US State Department regarding the attack on a family member of a Polish diplomat. On the morning of November 29th, three thugs broke into the home of Mr. Chiaer, Second Secretary of the Polish Embassy in the United States.

    At the time, only Mr. Chiaer's wife was at home. The three men maliciously incited her, asked her provocative questions, and searched everywhere. They spoke to her in Polish, but among themselves, they spoke in German and English.

    Mrs. Chiaer asked them to leave, but to no avail. So she tried to call the Polish Embassy. At that moment, the thugs grabbed her neck, beat her in the waist, and viciously strangled her, preventing her from breathing. Then, Mrs. Chiaer was struck on the head and lost consciousness.

    Her husband discovered the situation when he returned home in the evening. On the doctor's orders, she was sent to the hospital. Personnel from the Polish Embassy and officials from the US State Department and the police department quickly arrived at Mr. Chiaer's residence.

    Mr. Spasowski, the Polish People's Republic Ambassador to the United States, protested to the US State Department about this attack, which was by no means a daytime robbery, demanding that the criminals be investigated and severely punished.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 5th. The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial today entitled "Along the Old Road," condemning the anti-Polish campaign recently launched by the "New York Times."

    The editorial first pointed out that within American society, the desire to end the "Cold War," resolve disputes peacefully, and strengthen rapprochement between countries with different social systems is growing stronger. However, this does not mean that there are no longer people there who oppose the rapprochement of all nations, spread distrust, and attempt to exacerbate tensions. Recently, the "New York Times" launched an anti-Polish campaign in an attempt to damage Polish-American relations. This newspaper has published a series of articles slandering Poland, with the aim of distorting the reality of the situation in Poland.

    The editorial then pointed out that "New York Times" reporter Rosenthal spread untrue information and engaged in rumor-mongering, so the Polish side asked him to leave Poland. At the same time, because the "New York Times" published a series of articles slandering Poland, the Polish side decided to stop selling this newspaper in Poland. The Polish side also does not agree to the newspaper sending a new reporter to Warsaw because the newspaper cannot currently guarantee objective reporting on the situation in Poland.

    波兰外交官眷属在美遭受袭击
    波兰驻美大使提出抗议
    “人民论坛报”谴责“纽约时报”掀起反波运动
    新华社华沙5日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰驻美国大使就波外交官眷属遭歹徒袭击事向美国国务院提出抗议。11月29日早晨，有三名歹徒闯进波兰驻美国大使馆二等秘书恰耶尔的家里。
    当时只有恰耶尔的妻子一人在家，这三个人对她进行恶意煽动，向她提出一些挑衅性的问题，并且到处搜索。他们对她讲波兰语，而他们自己之间却讲德语和英语。
    恰耶尔夫人叫他们走开，但是毫无效果。于是她便试图去打电话给波兰大使馆，正在这个时刻，歹徒们卡住她的脖子，并殴打她的腰部，凶恶地勒她，不让她喘气。然后，恰耶尔夫人的头部受了打击，于是便失去了知觉。
    她的丈夫晚上回家后发现了这种情况。根据医生的吩咐把她送进了医院。波兰大使馆人员、美国国务院和警察局的官员很快便赶到了恰耶尔的住宅。
    波兰人民共和国驻美国大使斯帕索夫斯基就这次决非白昼行劫的袭击事件，向美国国务院提出了抗议，要求侦察并严惩罪犯。
    新华社华沙5日电　波兰“人民论坛报”今天发表了一篇题为“沿着老路”的社论，谴责“纽约时报”最近掀起的反波运动。
    社论首先指出，在美国社会上，要求结束“冷战”和用和平方式解决争端问题以及加强不同社会制度国家的互相接近的愿望日益强烈。但是，这并不表明那里已经没有反对各国人民接近、散布互不信任和企图加剧紧张的人了。最近“纽约时报”掀起了反波运动，企图破坏波美关系。这家报纸发表了一系列的诽谤波兰的文章，其目的在于歪曲波兰的现实情况。
    社论接着指出，“纽约时报”记者罗森塔尔传布了不真实的消息和进行造谣中伤，所以波兰方面要他离开了波兰。同时，由于“纽约时报”发表了一系列诽谤波兰的文章，波兰方面决定停止在波兰出售这一报刊。波兰方面也不同意该报往华沙派驻新的记者，因为现在这家报纸还不能够保证客观地介绍波兰的情况。
