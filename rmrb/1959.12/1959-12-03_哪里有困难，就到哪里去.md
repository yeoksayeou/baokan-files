Go Wherever There Is Difficulty
By our reporter Hai Bo

　　Right after dinner, a group came, beating gongs and drums, carrying good news and marching excitedly towards the workshop.

　　"Comrades of the skeleton assembly group, we're here to deliver good news!" The inspectors shouted loudly as they approached the skeleton assembly group.

　　"Ah! Good news for us."

　　Who should receive the good news? Li Jimao pushed Ding Sanhe to receive it, Ding Sanhe pushed Li Jimao to receive it. Just as they were pushing each other, unwilling to be the first to take the credit, the workshop's good news team also arrived. Perfect, two good news reports, one for each of them.

　　Li Jimao and Ding Sanhe held the good news reports in their hands, their hearts pounding, their faces flushed. They pulled a young man to the front of everyone. Everyone's eyes quickly turned to the young man, tall and slender, with delicate features, quite handsome. Everyone recognized him; it was Wu Lianghu, who was already well-known. Everyone was familiar with Wu Lianghu's diligence and hard work, and even more familiar with his communist spirit of bravely helping others.

　　Wu Lianghu was twenty-four years old this year. He was only nineteen when he joined the factory. At that time, no one could quite figure out his temperament. He worked a lot every day but spoke very little. At the time, he was assigned to the freight car workshop as a riveter. As soon as Wu Lianghu arrived, the atmosphere changed. He specifically sought out dirty work, sweating profusely without taking a break. If he didn't understand something, he would ask, and he would immediately accept any suggestions. The veteran workers saw that this young man was diligent and eager to learn, so they taught him with extra care. In just over a year, this young man quietly transformed into a third-grade riveter.

　　In 1958, the thunder of the Great Leap Forward resounded, and the Jiang'an Vehicle Factory, with more than fifty years of history, turned a new page, moving from repairing vehicles to manufacturing them. This news shook everyone in the factory, and everyone was very excited. Manufacturing freight cars, what a meaningful thing! Wu Lianghu's mind immediately began to churn. He rushed to sign up to participate in the trial production of the first vehicle. He was approved to work in the marking group. Going from repair to manufacturing was already a completely new task, and Wu Lianghu was a riveter, but he received the task of marking two center beams. The foreman said to him: "Little Wu, I can see that you're a good lad, capable, modest, and willing to learn. I'm entrusting this task to you, and I believe you can definitely complete it." This was a difficult task. The center beam is a major component of a car, and the quality requirements are very strict. Even a small error in marking is unacceptable. Not only had Little Wu never done this work before, but he hadn't even seen it done. He knew that there would be unimaginable difficulties. But he thought, if he didn't do it, who would? If no one did it, how could we make trains? His temperament never allowed him to retreat from a problem, so he said to the foreman:

　　"Okay! As long as the veteran workers help, I'll give it my all to get it done."

　　After work started, Wu Lianghu was lost in the workshop. During the day, he just stuffed some food in his mouth while eating, and at night, when others were sleeping, he was still pondering in the workshop. He held the blueprints, looked at one point and drew it, erased it and redrew it if it was wrong. He would often rework a single eye several times. Every time he reworked, he would ask a veteran worker for advice and then summarize it himself. For two full days and almost two nights, he finally completed the marking. His achievement surprised the picky inspectors. The inspectors compared and measured his work for most of the day, then asked: "Little Wu, have you done this kind of work before?" At first, Little Wu thought it was not up to standard and replied, "No, not up to..." The inspector immediately smiled and said: "No! It's great! Just like an old hand."

　　Marking is the first process in car manufacturing, and the marking task was successfully completed thanks to the efforts of Wu Lianghu and other workers. Wu Lianghu felt happy from the bottom of his heart. But when he saw the work of the next process—the drilling group—he became anxious. Although they marked the lines accurately, the people in the drilling group drilled the holes crookedly, like snakes walking. According to requirements, the drilling tolerance cannot be greater than 0.5 millimeters, but the holes they drilled were off by three or four millimeters. The inspectors were furious. How could freight cars be manufactured on time like this? In the past, there was a saying on the railway: "Railway police only take care of their own section." Now, even though Wu Lianghu was from the marking group, he became uneasy about the work of the drilling group. Wu Lianghu thought, the Party often teaches that the working class must care about the collective, and this is absolutely true. See, no matter how fast the lines are marked, if the drilling can't keep up, cars still can't be produced. He ran to the drilling group, picked up the riveting gun, wanting to try it out, to figure out the principles, but after a few "da-da" sounds, the result was the same: the drilled holes were crooked. He didn't succeed after several attempts. The quality of work of the entire drilling group was more than 60% unqualified. The entire trial production work was stuck here. The work was crawling like a snail.

　　Now, the drilling matter was more important in Wu Lianghu's mind than his own work. Whether walking or sitting, in the factory or outside, he was paying attention to the drilling matter. One day, the factory organized a group of people to visit the Wuchang Vehicle Factory, which was a factory with better equipment. Some people were interested in the factory's new machines, some wanted to learn the operating techniques, but Wu Lianghu immediately noticed the factory's drilling methods. He found that this factory used bushing drilling, and the quality was very good. He wrote these down in his notebook one by one, and kept them in his mind. On the way home, he thought of a way to solve the drilling problem in his factory based on the experiences of others. After returning to the factory, he immediately found the veteran workers in the drilling group. Wu Lianghu said: "I learned a good drilling method." The workers in the drilling group were happy to hear that and asked: "What good method? If you solve our problem, we'll thank you properly." Little Wu said: "Don't thank me yet, let's talk about success first. How about we make a sleeve mold and try it!" Of course, no one would disagree with this young man's enthusiastic help. The veteran workers in the drilling group readily agreed. Two days later, the drilling sleeve mold was made, and after a test, there was indeed a Great Leap Forward. The drilling efficiency was increased six times compared to the original, and the quality was 100%.

　　In April of this year, one evening, Wu Lianghu was suddenly stopped by the secretary of the workshop's Party branch. The branch secretary was a very humorous person, and as soon as he saw Wu Lianghu, he said: "Little Wu, what do you say, what does it mean to transfer an advanced person to a backward place?" This stumped Little Wu, but Little Wu immediately anticipated his new task. Before Little Wu could answer, the branch secretary said again: "The Party has decided to transfer you to the skeleton assembly group to be the foreman. The skeleton assembly group is a wing of our workshop that hasn't taken flight. We should let it fly, so that the entire workshop can fly. Do you have any opinions?" Little Wu said: "I am a Communist Party member, wherever the Party tells me to go, I will go, and whatever I am told to do, I will do." The branch secretary happily smiled and said: "Yes, we young people should be like willow branches in spring, planted anywhere, living anywhere."

　　From then on, Little Wu came to the skeleton assembly group. Also coming to the skeleton assembly group was the veteran worker and Party group leader, Liu Keqin. Little Wu knew the significance of the Party transferring himself and Liu Keqin to the skeleton assembly group. Little Wu had long heard that the work situation in this group was not good. The daily quota was to rivet six "center plates," but they could only complete three at most, and there were frequent reworkings. Liu Keqin said to Little Wu: "Let's do it first, and take the lead to see how it goes." Lao Liu and Wu Lianghu went to do the dirty and tiring work that others were unwilling to do after work started, which had an impact on those young people, but it didn't solve the fundamental problem. By the third day, the situation was even worse. They only riveted two "center plates" a day, and 50% of them needed to be reworked. Little Wu panicked a little and asked Lao Liu "What to do?" Lao Liu was a veteran worker with eighteen years of experience, and he was a little anxious, but he didn't panic. Lao Liu thought for a while and said: "Isn't the Party constantly teaching us that under the leadership of the Party, as long as we rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, any problem can be solved? We must do as the Party instructs." The next day, Wu Lianghu went to talk to the veteran workers of this group, Li Jimao and Ding Sanhe, to discuss the reasons. Li Jimao was a fifth-grade worker, and was quite experienced in riveting, but his temper was terrible. He was the one doing the rework. Little Wu said: "What is the reason for the poor quality of work?" As soon as Li Jimao was asked, he said with a straight face: "This is because the technical equipment is poor. Other places use air-powered riveting guns, but we use hammer-powered riveting guns, so of course it won't be good." Little Wu went to talk to Ding Sanhe. Ding Sanhe was a young man in his twenties, a member of the Communist Youth League, active in his work, and spoke very bluntly. He couldn't get along with Li Jimao. Little Wu said: "Someone said it's because there is no air-powered riveting gun that the work is being done like this." As soon as Ding Sanhe heard this, he jumped up and said angrily:

"Who said that? That's a conservative thought. I can rivet better with a sledgehammer than with an air-powered riveting gun." Little Wu was happy to hear Ding Sanhe's opinion, knowing that there was an opposition, and the problem would be easier to solve. After Wu Lianghu and Liu Keqin discussed it, they decided to hold a live debate. At first, Li Jimao and Ding Sanhe fought. Li Jimao insisted that the low quality was because there was no air-powered riveting gun; Ding Sanhe said that riveting with a sledgehammer was better than with an air-powered riveting gun. The two of them, each representing one side, refused to give in.

Little Wu said: "I know everyone wants to do the work well. How about this! It's useless to just talk, let's have a competition to see who is a hero." This made everyone lively. Li Jimao rolled up his sleeves and said: "Okay, we have something to do with it, let's see about tomorrow!" The others also rubbed their fists and palms, wanting to try.

The next day, the entire group, with eight people, divided into two groups to rivet "center plates." Li Jimao and Ding Sanhe each led a group, one using air-powered riveting guns, and the other using hammer-powered riveting guns, planning to rivet four a day, and compare them in the evening. The others were also assigned tasks according to work needs, and their responsibilities were clarified. In the past, you couldn't hear their hammers ringing until one o'clock after work started. On this day, everyone arrived more than an hour before work started. After arriving, everyone immediately surrounded the assigned tasks, those who lit the stove lit the stove, those who added oil added oil, and they started working before the work bell rang. Everyone was like a dragon and a tiger. By noon, Li Jimao's group completed four "center plates" two minutes earlier than Ding Sanhe's group, but the quality of two rivets was slightly poor. Two minutes later, Ding Sanhe's group also riveted four "center plates," and the quality was all qualified. They did more work in one morning than they did in the past two days.

Everyone's enthusiasm was great. Those who were not at ease working here were now at ease. Those who emphasized difficulties made self-criticisms, conservative thoughts were broken, the tasks were completed every day exceeding the quota, and the wing of the skeleton assembly group took flight.

Wu Lianghu is like a master key, wherever there is difficulty, he goes there; wherever the Party points, he fights there, and he is always successful. Just as he had launched the wing of the skeleton assembly group, the organization transferred him and Liu Keqin to the steel plate blanking group.

Everyone was leaping forward, but this steel plate blanking group brought a lot of unhappiness to the Great Leap Forward. Their scrap rate reached 60%, there was no plan in production, they grabbed whatever was there, and they only counted what they did. They did a lot of this kind of work, but very little of that kind of work, and it was not enough to be matched. As soon as they came, they held a meeting with everyone, asking everyone to raise problems, find reasons, and think of ways. Some veteran workers suggested: "Use the cutting machine, it can improve work efficiency a lot, and the quality is good."

Some suggested: "Move the outdoor work indoors, which can guarantee the quality."

Everyone had a lot of opinions, most of which were good opinions. But some people didn't want to speak, because these suggestions had been raised several times in the past, but no one had organized them to be implemented. Wu Lianghu and Liu Keqin were different from their predecessors. After everyone raised their opinions, they immediately started working according to everyone's suggestions the next day. Wu Lianghu cleaned up the parts with everyone, and at the same time suggested that everyone perform oxygen cutting in sections. In order to strengthen the sense of responsibility, everyone's work was marked with their own name. He also used six evenings of his spare time to fix five deformed templates. As a result, the work of the blanking group also leaped forward. The quality increased from 60% to 98%, and the 1959 plan was completed three months ahead of schedule.

Now, Wu Lianghu has gone to the brake beam group, which is a key group in the workshop. The planned task is to complete six cars a day, but in the past, only two to three cars could be completed every day. After Wu Lianghu went, recently, not only can he complete the plan every day, but he can also exceed the plan by 50%.

    哪里有困难，就到哪里去
    本报记者　海波
    晚饭刚过，就敲锣打鼓，拿着喜报兴冲冲地迎着车间走来。
    “骨架组的同志们，给你们送喜报啦！”报喜的检查员们走到骨架组高声喊道。
    “啊！给我们报喜。”
    一张喜报，该谁去接呢？李继茂推丁三和去接，丁三和推李继茂去接，正当他们互相推让，不肯首先接功的时候，车间的报喜队也来了，正好，两张喜报，一人一张。
    李继茂和丁三和手里接着喜报，心里嘭嘭地跳，脸上红通通的。他们一手把个年轻小伙子拉到了大家面前。大家把目光迅速转向了青年人，这青年人长高条，眉清目秀，生的挺俊的。大家一看这不是别人，原来又是早已熟悉的吴良湖。大家熟悉吴良湖自己的那种勤学苦练的干劲，大家更熟悉吴良湖那种勇敢帮助别人的共产主义品质。
    吴良湖今年二十四岁，进厂那年才十九岁，当时，谁也摸不透他的脾气，一天到晚，干活很多，说话却很少，当时他被分配到货车车间作铆工。吴良湖一来，气势就不一样，专门找脏活干，累得满头大汗也不休息。不懂就问，别人提了意见马上就接受。老师傅看到这青年人勤学苦干，教他也就特别用心。只有一年多的时间，这个小青年就不声不响地变成三级铆工了。
    1958年大跃进的春雷响了，有五十多年厂史的江岸车辆厂翻开了新的一页，要由修理车辆走向制造车辆了。这个消息震动了全厂的人们，大家非常兴奋。制造货车，这是一件多么有意义的事情呀！吴良湖脑子里立刻沸腾起来了。他抢着报名参加了第一台车辆的试制工作。他被批准在画线组工作。由修理到制造本来就是一个全新的工作，而吴良湖是个铆工，却接到了画两个中梁的任务。工长对他说：“小吴，我看出你是个好样的，能行，虚心、肯学习。把这个任务交给你，我相信你一定能完成。”这是一个艰难的任务。中梁是一辆车上的主要部件，质量要求十分严格，画错一点都不行。小吴过去不但没有作过这个工作，就是连看也没看过。他知道这里存在着多少想像不到的困难。但是，他又想，自己不作又找谁作呢？都不作怎能制成火车呢？他的脾气从不兴向后退着想问题，于是他对工长说：
    “行！只要老师傅帮忙，我拼上命也要干出来。”
    工作开始后，吴良湖就迷在车间了，白天吃饭的时候随便塞点东西在口里，晚上别人睡觉他还在车间琢磨。他拿着图纸，看一点画一点，划一遍不对擦了再画，画了又擦，画一个眼子往往是返工几次。返工一次，他就去请教老师傅一次，自己再总结一次。整整两天和差不多两个夜晚，终于画成了。他的成就使那些好挑毛病的检查员大吃一惊。检查员在他画的工作物上又比又量，检查了大半天以后，问道：“小吴，你过去干过这个活吗？”开始小吴以为不合格，答道：“没有，不合……”检查员马上笑着说：“不！太好啦！简直像个老手。”
    画线是造车的第一道工序，画线任务在吴良湖和其他工人的努力下顺利完成了。吴良湖从内心里感到高兴。可是当他看到下一道工序——钻眼组的工作的时候，使他着起急来了。他们画的线虽然准确，可是钻眼组的人却把眼子钻得歪歪扭扭像蛇走路。按照要求，钻眼的公差不能大于零点五毫米，可是他们钻的眼子却差三、四个毫米。检查员看了，一肚子火儿，像这样怎能按时造成货车呢？在过去，铁路上有句话是“铁路巡警，不管别人的一段。”现在吴良湖虽是画线组的人，却对钻眼组的工作不安起来了。吴良湖想，党经常教导说工人阶级必须关心集体，这话真是一点不假。看，线画的再快，钻眼跟不上，还不是出不了车吗？他跑到钻眼组，拿起铆枪，想试试看，摸点道理出来，可是“哒哒”了几下，结果也是一样，钻的眼子东歪西倒，搞了几次都不成功。整个钻眼组的工作质量，有60％以上不合格。整个试制工作在这里卡住了。工作像蜗牛一样缓慢地爬行着。
    现在，钻眼的事在吴良湖的脑子里比他自己的工作还重要了。无论走着坐着，在厂里，到外面，他都在注意钻眼的事儿。一天，厂里组织一批人到武昌车辆厂参观，这是一个设备比较好的工厂，有的人对这个厂的新式机器有兴趣，有的人想学习人家的操作技术，可是吴良湖一下子就注意到这个厂钻眼的方法。他发现这个厂用了套管钻眼，质量很好。他把这些一一写在本子上，记在心里。回家路上，他就根据别人的经验把解决自己厂里钻眼的方法想好了，回厂后当即找到钻眼组的老师傅，吴良湖说：“我学到了一个钻眼的好办法。”钻眼组的工人一听，高兴地问：“什么好办法？你要解决我们的问题，我们好好谢谢你。”小吴说：“先别忙谢，成功再说，我们作个套模试试怎么样！”对这位青年的这种热情的帮助，那有什么不同意的，钻眼组的老师傅当然是满口答应。过了两天就把钻眼套模作出来了，一试验，可真是来了个大跃进，钻眼工效比原来提高了六倍，质量百分之百。
    今年4月，一个晚上，吴良湖忽然被车间党支部书记拉住了。支部书记是个说话挺有风趣的人，一见到吴良湖就说：“小吴，你说，一个先进的人把他调到落后的地方去，这意味着什么？”这一下把小吴问糊涂了，可是小吴立即就预感到他的新任务。没等小吴回答，支部书记又说：“党决定调你到骨架组去当工长。骨架组是我们车间一支没有飞起来的翅膀，我们应该让他飞起来，这样整个车间才能飞起来。你有什么意见？”小吴说：“我是共产党员，党叫我到哪里，我一定到哪里，叫干什么就干什么。”支部书记高兴地笑着说：“对，我们青年人应该像一支春天的柳条，播到哪里，活在哪里。”
    从此，小吴来到了骨架组。同时来到骨架组的还有老师傅、党的小组长刘克勤。小吴知道党把自己和刘克勤调到骨架组的意义。小吴早就听说过这个组的工作情况不妙，一天的定额是铆六个“心盘”，但他们顶多完成三个，而且经常返工。刘克勤对小吴说：“咱们先干，带个头看怎么样”。老刘和吴良湖上班之后就先去干那些别人不愿干的又脏又累的活，这对那些青年人有影响，可是没解决根本问题。到第三天，情况更坏了，一天只铆了两个“心盘”还有50％要返工。小吴有点慌了，问老刘“怎么办”？老刘是个有十八年工龄的老工人，急也有点急，但却不慌，老刘想了想说：“党不是时刻教导我们，在党的领导下，只要依靠群众，发动群众，什么问题都会解决吗？我们必须照着党的指示办。”第二天，吴良湖就去找这个组的老师傅李继茂和丁三和谈原因。李继茂是个五级工，铆活挺有经验的，性子扭的不行，这返工的活就是他干的。小吴说：“这活质量这样坏是什么原因？”李继茂一见来问就绷着脸说：“这是因为技术设备差，别的地方都是用风顶的，我们这里用捶顶，当然不会好。”小吴又去找丁三和谈，丁三和是个二十多岁的小伙子，共青团员，干活积极，说话挺粗的，跟李继茂硬是谈不到一块。小吴说：“把活干得这样，有人说是没有风顶。”丁三和一听，就气的暴跳说：
  “这是谁说的。这是保守思想，我用大锤顶，比风顶还好些。”小吴一听，丁三和的意见，心里高兴，知道有了对立面，问题就好解决了。小吴和刘克勤商量了一下以后，决定开个现场辩论会。一开始，李继茂和丁三和就斗起来了。李继茂坚持说所以质量低，就是因为没有风顶；丁三和就说用大锤顶比风顶还好些。两个人你一言，我一语，各代表一方，互不相让，顶住了。
    小吴说：“我知道大家都是想把工作作好的。咱们这样吧！光说没用，是英雄是好汉，比赛比赛看。”这一下，可把大家搞活了。李继茂把袖子一挽说：“好，像这样说，我们也有个干头，看明天的吧！”其他的人也磨拳擦掌想试试看。
    第二天，全组以八个人分两组铆“心盘”，李继茂、丁三和各带一组，一用风顶，一用锤顶，计划一天铆四个，晚上评比。其他人也根据工作需要进行了分工，明确了职责。过去是上班后一点钟还听不到他们的锤响。这一天，上班前一个多钟头大家就到齐了，到后每人马上按分工包围，生炉子的生炉子，加油的加油，上班钟响以前就叮叮当当干起来了。一个个生龙活虎一般，到了中午，李继茂组比丁三和组提前两分钟，完成了四个“心盘”，但有两个铆钉质量略差一点，两分钟后丁三和组四个“心盘”也铆成了，质量全部合格。他们一上午干的活顶过去两天。
    这一家伙大家的劲头可就大了。不安心在这里工作的人安心了。强调困难的人自己作了检查，保守思想被打破了，任务天天超额完成，骨架组这个翅膀飞起来了。
    吴良湖像一把万能钥匙，哪里有困难，他就到哪里；党指到哪里，他就打到哪里，而且百发百中。把骨架组这支翅膀刚刚发动起来，组织上又调他和刘克勤到钢板下料组来了。
    大家都在跃进，这钢板下料组却给大跃进带来很多不愉快。他们报废率达到了60％，生产上毫无计划，抓到哪里是哪里，干了什么算什么。这样活干了一大堆，那样活干的很少，不够用无法配套。他们来了马上就和大家开了会，让大家提问题，找原因，想办法。有的老师傅建议：“把切割机用起来，它能提高工效很多，质量又好。”
    有的建议：“室外作业搬到室内来，可以保证质量。”
    大家意见纷纷，大都是些好意见。但有些人不想发言。因为这些建议过去都提过好几次了，就是没人组织执行。吴良湖和刘克勤与前任不同，大家提了意见，第二天马上就根据大家的建议干起来了。吴良湖和大家一道清理了配件，同时又建议大家分段进行氧割，为了加强责任感，每人作的活上都记上自己的名字。他还用六个晚上的业余时间改好了五个变了型的样板。于是下料组的工作也飞跃起来了。质量由60％提高到98％，并且提前三个月完成了1959年的计划。
    现在，吴良湖又到了制动梁组，这是车间的一个关键组，计划任务是一天成车六辆，但过去实际每天只能完成二至三辆，吴良湖去后，最近每天不仅可以完成计划，而且可以超过计划50％。
