    Artificial Wave Making
    China's first large-scale harbor wave generating equipment was recently successfully trial-produced in Nanjing, and after installation and adjustment, its performance is excellent.

    Harbor wave generating equipment is important equipment used to generate artificial waves. Using this equipment to generate artificial waves to study sediment movement under wave action is an important task for solving harbor siltation and channel problems. This large-scale harbor wave generating equipment that has been manufactured can generate 43 to 240 artificial waves per minute.

    This equipment was designed by teachers from the Teaching and Research Group of Mechanical Principles and Parts at the Nanjing Institute of Technology.

    人工造海浪
    我国第一台大型海港生波设备最近在南京试制成功，经过安装调整，性能优良。
    海港生波设备是用来产生人造海浪的重要设备。利用这种设备产生人造波浪研究在波浪作用下的泥沙运动情况，是解决海港泥沙和航道问题的重要工作。已经制成的这台大型海港生波设备，每分钟能够产生四十三次到二百四十次人造海浪。
    这台设备是由南京工学院机械原理及零件教研组教师设计的。
