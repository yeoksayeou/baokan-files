Two Methods of Accounting
*Shanxi Daily* Editorial

    As 1959 draws to a close and 1960 approaches, there are two major tasks in industrial production to focus on in these last ten days of the year. One is to seize every day at the year-end, sprint for a final victory, and ensure the comprehensive fulfillment of this year's state plan. The other is to prepare for next year's production, creating favorable conditions for a "flying start" in the new year. The starting point for doing a good job in preparing for next year's production is to formulate an annual plan, as well as plans for the first quarter and the first month. Formulating a plan requires accounting: accounting for labor, equipment, and materials. Based on the labor, equipment, and material situation, determine next year's production targets. There are two ways to account for these things: one is to see only things and not people, only calculating "dead" accounts and not "live" accounts; the other is to see both things and people, calculating both "dead" accounts and "live" accounts. These two methods of accounting reflect the struggle between two ideologies and two paths: one is the path of the promoting faction, aiming for more, faster, better, and more economical results, and the other is the path of the conservative faction, aiming for less, slower, worse, and more expensive results.

    Let's look at the two methods of accounting under the guidance of these two ideologies. On the issue of labor, the conservative faction does not see the inexhaustible creative power hidden in the masses of workers. They believe that one person can only do the work of one person, and therefore advocate doing as much as there are people, and that increasing production requires increasing manpower. Without increasing manpower, production cannot be increased, and there can be no continued leap forward. The promoting faction's view is exactly the opposite. They acknowledge that human actions cannot exceed the scope allowed by objective laws, but at the same time, they believe that within the scope allowed by objective laws, maximizing the subjective initiative of the revolutionary masses can have a positive reaction to objective material and technical conditions. As long as we summon up enough energy, give full play to the revolutionary determination and revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, improve tools, and improve labor organization, so that one person can do the work of one and a half or more people, we can achieve increased production without increasing manpower. There have been many, many examples of this over the years, especially since August of this year, when factories and mines have implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. After opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, the number of personnel remains the same, but production has increased significantly. Taiyuan Boiler Factory mobilized the masses to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and from the end of November to the present, it has achieved 35 major innovation projects, increasing production efficiency by one to thirteen times and greatly saving labor.

    On the issue of equipment, the conservative faction always separates the role of people from production equipment. When the equipment is good, they feel that there is no potential to be tapped; when the equipment is not good, they feel that "native guns and cannons" are not worth much. Therefore, when formulating plans, they always focus on the existing equipment, believing that the equipment capacity is as large as it can produce that much product; if the equipment is good and wants to increase production, it needs to add new equipment; if the equipment is not good and wants to increase production, it requires the state to allocate modern equipment to it, otherwise, it is impossible to increase production. The promoting faction disagrees with this view. They acknowledge that the quality and quantity of equipment are directly related to whether the production plan can be completed, but at the same time, they see that equipment can be completely changed. When the equipment is good, they actively improve the process, improve product design, improve operating methods, and strengthen equipment maintenance to increase equipment utilization, so that one set of equipment can be used as one and a half or more sets of equipment. The example of the oxygen workshop of Taiyuan Chemical Plant is like this. This workshop is completely modern equipment. Due to the innovations carried out by the workshop staff and masses in the above aspects, the average daily output of oxygen has exceeded the design capacity by more than 60%, making one set of equipment top one and a half sets, and more than 50 employees in the entire workshop are doing the work of one and a half people. When the equipment is poor, they actively improve design technology, improve equipment and tools, and eliminate weak links in the equipment, so that cumbersome manual labor can be semi-mechanized and mechanized, and old equipment and small equipment can produce more and larger products. Taiyuan Boiler Factory is like this. The equipment of this factory is old and incomplete, especially lacking large-scale production equipment, but because the staff and masses broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and gave play to the creative spirit of daring to think and act, leading cadres and technicians combined with workers, successfully trial-produced ductile iron, overcame the difficulty of not having steelmaking equipment, and cast an 800-ton hydraulic press with cupolas with a total melting capacity of only six tons and three-ton hand-pulled chain hoists. In a word, the promoting faction fully considers the objective conditions of technical equipment and highly gives play to the subjective initiative of people, making the plan based on a foundation that is both proactive and reliable.

    On the issue of raw materials, the conservative faction says that "even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice," failing to see the potential power of raw materials, advocating doing as much as there are raw materials, producing more if there are more raw materials, and producing less if there are fewer raw materials; if production is to be increased, the state must allocate more raw materials, otherwise it is impossible to continue the leap forward. On this issue, the views of the promoting faction and the conservative faction are exactly the opposite. They acknowledge that porridge cannot be made without rice, but at the same time, they believe that materials are created by people, and if there is no "rice," "rice" can be created; and with a little rice, more porridge can be made. They adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods and self-reliance to actively increase the production of raw materials. At the same time, they improve product design, improve process operations, strengthen the processing of raw materials, and take measures such as conservation, substitution, and comprehensive utilization to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials in every possible way, using relatively few raw materials to produce more and better quality products. Examples of this are also common. Jinxi Machinery Factory encountered the difficulty of insufficient raw materials in continuing the leap forward this year, but they did not reach out to the state for raw materials, but mobilized the masses to adopt the "one-dragon" material usage method, utilizing large, small, edge, surplus, and scrap materials. From July to the end of November, the factory saved a total of 996 tons of steel, ensuring the completion of the production plan.

    Two methods of accounting lead to two different conclusions. The conservative faction does not see the subjective initiative of people, does not have a true understanding of the objective laws of the development of things, so they become more and more confused, more and more pessimistic, and more and more disappointed as they calculate; after calculating and calculating, they feel that it is impossible to increase production without increasing labor and equipment, and the conclusion is that there can be no continued leap forward next year. The promoting faction fully considers the objective possibilities of material and technical conditions, and also fully considers the revolutionary subjective initiative of the staff and masses, taking the subjective initiative of people as one of the main bases when formulating plans. Therefore, the more they calculate, the clearer they become, the wider they become, the higher their enthusiasm becomes, and the greater their energy becomes. The conclusion is that as long as they rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and fully tap the potential of enterprises, without increasing labor and equipment, next year's production level can be greatly improved compared with this year, and better continue the leap forward on the basis of this year's leap forward. It seems that planning must be done with good accounting. The process of accounting is the process of mobilizing the masses, the process of concentrating the wisdom of the masses, the process of struggle between old and new ideas, and the process of innovation. Only through accounting can we refute right-leaning conservative ideas, establish leap-forward ideas, overcome negative factors, mobilize positive factors, and unify ideological understanding. If the method of accounting is correct and calculated well, we can formulate a plan that is both proactive and reliable; if the method of accounting is incorrect and calculated wrong, we will not be able to formulate a plan for continued leap forward. Now, factories and mines are formulating next year's production plan. When formulating the plan, we must calculate in detail with the spirit of the promoting faction. Not only should the leading cadres calculate, but also mobilize the vast masses to calculate. Through accounting, formulate next year's leap forward plan, and according to the formulated leap forward plan, actively prepare for raw materials, equipment maintenance, spare parts, and specific plans for technical innovation and technical revolution, fully tap the potential of enterprises, and ensure the realization of next year's leap forward plan.

　　两种算账方法
　　山西日报社论
    1959年即将过去，1960年就要到来，在这年终岁尾的最后十天里，工业生产上要抓好两件大事：一件是，要抓紧岁末每一天，冲刺决战，确保全面完成今年国家计划；另一件是，要做好明年生产准备工作，为实现明年生产开门红创造有利条件。搞好明年生产准备工作的起点，是编制年度计划，以及制订首季首月的计划，编制计划就要算账：算劳力账，算设备账，算材料账。根据劳力、设备、材料情况，确定明年生产指标。账有两种算法，一种是见物不见人，只算“死”账不算“活”账；另一种是既见物又见人，既算“死”账也算“活”账。两种算账方法，反映了两种思想和两条道路的斗争，一条是促进派的多快好省的道路，一条是保守派的少慢差费的道路。
    且看在两种思想指导下的两种算账方法：在劳力问题上，保守派看不到工人群众中蕴藏着的无穷无尽的创造力量，他们认为一个人只能干一个人的活，因而主张有多少人办多少事，要增产就必须增加人。不增人就不能增产，就不能继续跃进。促进派的看法恰恰相反，他们承认人的行动不可以超越客观规律所允许的范围，但同时却认为在客观规律所允许的范围内，最大限度地发挥革命群众的主观能动性，就能够对客观物质技术条件起积极的反作用。只要鼓足干劲，发挥群众的革命毅力和革命首创精神，大闹技术革新和技术革命，改进工具，改善劳动组织，使一个人干一个半人或者更多人的活，做到增产不增人。历年来这方面的事例是很多很多的，特别是今年8月份以来，各厂矿企业贯彻执行了党的八届八中全会精神，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，人员还是那么多，但生产却有了显著的提高。太原锅炉厂发动群众大搞技术革新和技术革命，从11月下旬起到现在，就实现了重大革新项目三十五项，生产效率提高了一倍到十三倍，大大节省了劳动力。
    在设备问题上，保守派总是把人的作用和生产设备割裂起来看待，设备好的时候，觉得没有什么潜力可挖；设备不好的时候，又觉得“土枪土炮”没有多大油水。因此，他们在制订计划的时候，总是把眼睛放在现有的那些设备上，认为设备能力有多大，就只能生产多少产品；设备好的如果要再增产，就需要再增加新的设备；设备不好的如果要再增产，就要求国家给他调拨现代化的设备，否则，就不可能增产。促进派和这种看法相反，他们承认设备好坏、多少，对能否完成生产计划有直接关系，但同时又看到设备是完全可以改变的。设备好的时候，积极改善工艺，改进产品设计，改进操作方法，加强设备维修，提高设备利用率，使一套设备顶一套半或者更多的设备使用。太原化工厂氧气车间的事例就是这样。这个车间完全是现代化的设备，由于车间职工群众在上述几个方面进行了革新，就使氧气平均日产量超过了设计能力的60％以上，作到了一套设备顶一套半，全车间五十多个职工，每个人在做着一个半人的工作。设备差的时候，更是积极地改善设计工艺、改进设备工具，消除设备上的薄弱环节，使繁笨的手工劳动实现半机械化和机械化，使旧设备和小设备生产出更多更大的产品。太原锅炉厂就是这样。这个厂设备陈旧不全，特别是缺乏大型生产设备，但由于职工群众破除迷信，解放思想，发挥了敢想敢干的创造精神，领导干部和技术人员与工人相结合，试制成功球墨铸铁，克服了没有铸钢设备的困难，用熔化总和只有六吨的冲天炉和三吨手拉倒链，铸成了八百吨重的水压机。一句话，促进派是既充分考虑技术设备的客观条件，又高度发挥人的主观能动作用，使计划建立在既积极先进而又可靠的基础上。
    在原材料问题上，保守派的说法是“巧媳妇难作无米粥”，看不到原材料的潜在力量，主张有多少原材料办多少事情，原材料多就多生产，原材料少就少生产；如果要增加生产，必须由国家增拨原材料，否则就不可能继续跃进。在这个问题上，促进派和保守派的看法又是恰恰相反，他们承认无米作不出粥来，但同时认为，物质是人创造的，没有“米”，可以创造出“米”；用少许的米，可以做出更多的粥。他们采取土洋结合、自力更生的办法，积极地增产原材料，同时，改善产品设计、改进工艺操作，加强原材料的加工处理，采取节约、代用和综合利用的办法，千方百计克服原材料不足困难，用比较少的原材料，生产更多的和质量优良的产品。这方面的事例也是屡见不鲜的。晋西机器厂今年在继续跃进中，首先遇到的就是原材料不足的困难，但他们并没有伸手向国家要原材料，而是发动群众采取“一条龙”用料法，把大料、小料、边料、余料、脚料都利用起来，从7月份起到11月底，全厂共节约了钢材九百九十六吨，保证了生产计划的完成。
    两种算账方法，得出两种不同的结论。保守派看不到人的主观能动作用，对事物的客观发展规律没有真正的认识，因而他们越算越糊涂，越算越悲观，越算越失望；算来算去，觉得不增加劳动力和设备，增加生产是万万不可能的，所得出的结论就是明年不能够继续跃进。促进派既充分考虑到物质技术条件的客观可能性，也充分考虑到职工群众革命的主观能动性，在制订计划的时候，把人的主观能动性作为主要依据之一。因而越算越明朗，越算越广阔，越算劲头越高，干劲越大，得出的结论是，只要依靠群众，发动群众，充分挖掘企业潜力，不增加劳力和设备，明年的生产水平也可以比今年大大提高，在今年跃进的基础上更好地继续跃进。看来，订计划必须很好算账。算账的过程就是发动群众的过程，就是集中群众智慧的过程，就是新旧思想斗争的过程，就是革新的过程。只有通过算账，才能驳倒右倾保守思想，树立跃进思想，克服消极因素，调动积极因素，统一思想认识。算账的方法对头了，算好了，就可以订出既积极先进而又可靠的计划来；算账的方法不对头、算错了，就不会订出继续跃进的计划来。现在各厂矿企业正在制订明年的生产计划，在制订计划的时候，一定要以促进派的气魄来详细算账，不仅领导干部要算，而且要发动广大群众来算，通过算账，制订出明年的跃进计划，根据制订的跃进计划，积极做好原材料准备、设备维修和备品备件以及技术革新和技术革命的具体规划，充分挖掘企业潜力，保证明年跃进计划的实现。　（原载12月21日山西日报）
