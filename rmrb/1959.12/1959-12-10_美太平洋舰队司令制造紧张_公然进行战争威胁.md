Xinhua News Agency, Pearl Harbor, 9th December: The US Pacific Fleet Commander, Hopwood, openly issued a belligerent threat against the Soviet Union and China on the 7th.

In an article written for the Associated Press on the 18th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, he vigorously advocated that the United States should maintain "strength" in the Far East and Pacific regions. Hopwood viciously slandered and attacked the Soviet Union and China on issues such as Korea, Indochina, Laos, and even Tibet, and said, "American influence must continue to be exerted in the Far East... and it is impossible to exert this form of influence without the land and naval strength provided by the armed forces.”

Hopwood clamored that the US Pacific Fleet is "a fully manned and readily deployable force," and "this fleet is constantly maintained in a high state of readiness." He said, "The US Navy must remain in the Far East now and for the foreseeable future" and must "continue to prepare constantly."

    美太平洋舰队司令制造紧张
    公然进行战争威胁
    新华社9日讯　珍珠港消息：美国太平洋舰队总司令霍普伍德7日公然对苏联和中国发出好战威胁。
    他在为珍珠港事件十八周年替美联社写的一篇文章里竭力鼓吹美国要在远东和太平洋地区保持“实力”。霍普伍德就朝鲜、印度支那、老挝甚至西藏等问题对苏联和中国发出恶毒的诬蔑和攻击，并且说，“必须在远东继续运用美国的影响……而要发挥这种形式的影响，如果没有武装部队提供的陆军和海军实力是不可能的。”
    霍普伍德叫嚷说，美国的太平洋舰队是“是一支满员的和随时可以出动的部队”，“这支舰队经常保持高度的准备状态”。他说，“美国海军在现在和可预见的将来必须留在远东”，并要“继续不断地准备”。
