Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 14th. Departments concerned and people from all walks of life in Northern Vietnam are actively making preparations to welcome overseas Vietnamese residing in Thailand to return to the country.

Premier Pham Van Dong, at a meeting in Haiphong on the 11th to prepare for welcoming overseas Vietnamese returning from Thailand, called on cadres and people to warmly welcome overseas Vietnamese to return to participate in socialist construction.

Premier Pham Van Dong said that during their stay abroad, many overseas Vietnamese in Thailand have encountered great difficulties, but their hearts are always with the motherland, with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and with President Ho, hoping that one day they can return to their homeland to participate in the construction of the motherland. They are so enthusiastic about the motherland, and the people of the motherland should warmly welcome them back.

The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Vietnam recently also issued a notice calling on all departments and cadres at all levels to make preparations for welcoming overseas Vietnamese returning to the country.

According to the agreement signed in Rangoon in August between the delegation of the RedCross Society of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the delegation of the RedCross Society of Thailand, overseas Vietnamese residing in Thailand will return to the country in batches starting from January next year.
