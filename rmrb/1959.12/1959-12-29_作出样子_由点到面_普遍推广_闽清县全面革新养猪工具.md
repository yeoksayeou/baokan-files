Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou - Minqing County, Fujian Province, has comprehensively innovated pig-raising tools in all collective pig farms. In half a month, the county universally promoted advanced tools and measures such as earthen running water, feed choppers, steam engines for cooking green feed, wooden tracks for transporting feed, and automatic injection of pig manure into manure pits. This greatly improved pig-raising efficiency, increasing the average number of pigs raised per feeder from twenty-one to sixty-five, with the most reaching one hundred and twelve, powerfully promoting the development of the pig-raising industry.

Minqing County recently formulated a plan for the great development of pig production. If calculated according to the original work efficiency of the feeders, one-quarter of the existing labor force in the county would have to be transferred to be feeders next year. The county party committee believed that this problem could only be solved by vigorously carrying out the reform of pig-raising tools. Therefore, it sent Pan Changheng, a member of the county party committee and the first secretary of the Bandong Commune party committee, to the Sanxi Livestock Farm to study the comprehensive reform of pig-raising tools and create typical experiences.

The Sanxi Livestock Farm has a total of one hundred and twelve pigs and three feeders, with each person feeding an average of more than thirty-seven pigs. Because chopping feed, carrying water, and carrying feed all relied on manual labor, the feeders were very busy all day and could not take care of everything. After Pan Changheng came here, he repeatedly studied and designed with the feeders and commune members, and made five improvements to the pig-raising tools. First, they promoted the earthen running water method, using bamboo tubes as water pipes to directly draw spring water from the mountains to the feed room, stove, and pigsty, saving all manual labor for carrying water. Second, they used hydropower to drive the feed chopper to chop feed. One person only spent two hours a day to chop the feed that could only be chopped in one day, and the feed was chopped finely, which the pigs liked to eat very much. Third, they changed cooking feed to steaming feed, which not only saved firewood but also prevented the chlorophyll and vitamins in the green feed from being destroyed, and the quality was better than fermentation, and could kill bacteria. Fourth, they laid wooden tracks, and the feed was transported to the side of the pigsty by wooden rail cars. Through funnels and bamboo pipes, the feed automatically flowed into the feeding trough, shortening the pig feeding time by two-thirds. Fifth, they used the commanding terrain to build manure ditches around the pigsty and used running water to wash the pigsty, so that the pig manure directly flowed into the manure pit, which saved labor and was clean and hygienic. After the above series of tool reforms, one feeder could feed all one hundred and twelve pigs in the Sanxi Livestock Farm, saving two feeders to expand new breeding farms and greatly increase pig raising and manure accumulation.

The experience of the Sanxi Livestock Farm has been universally promoted in all pig farms in the county. The party committee secretaries of each commune are personally in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements, on the one hand, organizing blacksmiths and carpenters as professional teams to rush to manufacture improved pig-raising tools, and on the other hand, letting go of mobilizing the masses, organizing commune members to cooperate with each other and reform tools by themselves according to the principle of making use of available resources, self-reliance, and local materials. It only took half a month, and the main pig-raising labor in all one hundred and twelve collective pig farms in the county was fully realized with technological innovation.

　　作出样子　由点到面　普遍推广
    闽清县全面革新养猪工具
    新华社福州讯　福建闽清县各集体养猪场全面革新养猪工具。在半个月中，全县普遍推广了土自来水、饲料切碎机、蒸气机煮青饲料、木轨道运送饲料和猪粪尿自动注入粪池等先进工具和措施，大大提高养猪效率，使饲养员平均每人喂猪由二十一头增加到六十五头，最多的达到一百一十二头，有力地推动了养猪业的发展。
    闽清县最近订出养猪生产大发展的规划，如果按原来饲养员的工作效率计算，明年全县就要调出现有劳力四分之一当饲养员才行。县委认为只有大搞养猪工具改革，才能解决这个问题，于是便派县委委员兼坂东公社党委第一书记潘长恒到三溪畜牧场研究养猪工具全面改革问题，创造典型经验。
    三溪畜牧场共有一百一十二头猪，三个饲养员，每人平均喂猪三十七头多。由于切饲料、提水和挑饲料等全靠人工，饲养员整天很忙，也照顾不过来。潘长恒来到这里后，便和饲养员社员们反复研究、设计，对养猪工具作了五方面的改进。一、推广土自来水办法，用竹筒作水管，把山上的泉水直接引到饲料房、灶头与猪舍内，节省了全部挑水人工。二、用水力带动饲料切碎机切饲料，一个人每天只花两个钟头就切完一天才能切完的饲料，而且饲料切得细，猪很喜欢吃。三、改煮饲料为蒸饲料，既省柴又能使青饲料的叶绿素和维生素不受破坏，质量比发酵的好，可以把细菌杀死。四、铺木轨道，饲料由木轨车运到猪舍旁，通过漏斗和竹管，使饲料自动流入食槽，缩短了三分之二的喂猪时间。五、利用居高临下的地势，在猪舍的四周筑起清肥沟，用自来水冲洗猪舍，使猪舍的粪尿直接流到粪池，既节省劳力，又清洁卫生。三溪畜牧场经过上述一系列的工具改革后，全场一百一十二头猪一个饲养员就能饲养，节省了两个饲养员用来扩建新的饲养场，大量增加养猪积肥。
    三溪畜牧场的经验已在全县各养猪场普遍推广，各公社都是党委书记亲自挂帅，大搞群众运动，一面组织铁木匠作为专业队伍，赶制养猪改良工具，一面放手发动群众，组织社员根据因陋就简自力更生就地取材的原则，相互协作，自己动手改革工具。先后只花了半个月时间，全县一百一十二个集体养猪场的主要养猪劳动就全部实现了技术革新。
