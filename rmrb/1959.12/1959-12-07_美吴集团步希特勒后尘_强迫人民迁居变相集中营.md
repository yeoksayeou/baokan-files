Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, news: According to newspapers here, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique is intensifying its efforts to forcibly relocate the people of Dien Ban District in Quang Nam Province to so-called "model villages" – disguised concentration camps.

From July of this year to the present, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique has forced the people in this area to demolish their houses and then build houses every thirty meters according to its plan. All the trees around the houses are cut down in order to make it easier for them to monitor and persecute the people.

The local people resolutely resist this policy of persecution by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique and oppose being concentrated in "model villages." Faced with this situation, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique sent henchmen to the villages to demolish residents' houses unexpectedly in order to prevent them from organizing in time to oppose them. In addition, these henchmen searched houses one by one, threatening the people to move to the "model villages" immediately, and also used beatings, imprisonment, and other methods to deal with those who disobeyed them.

In order to realize the forced concentration of people along the highway, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique forces 200-300 people every day in the Dien Ban area to build highways, demolish houses, and cut down trees. Those who are forced to build roads often have to travel two or three kilometers to carry mud. Anyone who disobeys the order is subjected to torture and persecution under the "crime" of "Viet Cong" or "betraying the country."

    美吴集团步希特勒后尘
    强迫人民迁居变相集中营
    新华社河内讯　据此间报纸报道，美国—吴庭艳集团正在加紧强迫广南省奠盘县人民集中到所谓“模范村”——变相的集中营居住。
    从今年7月到现在，美吴集团强迫这个地方的人民拆毁房子，然后按照它的计划每隔三十米修建一座房子，房屋周围的树木一律砍光，以便使他们容易监视和迫害人民。
    当地人民坚决抵制美吴集团的这种迫害政策，反对集中到“模范村”居住。面对这种情况，美吴集团派爪牙到各村出其不意地拆毁居民的房屋，以防止他们及时组织起来进行反对。此外，这些爪牙还逐家挨户搜查，威胁人民要立刻迁移到“模范村”居住，并且还以毒打、囚禁等来对付那些违抗他们的人。
    为了实现强迫人民沿着公路集中居住，美吴集团每天强迫二百—三百人在奠盘地区建筑公路，拆毁房子和砍光树木。被迫去修筑公路的人往往要跑两三公里的路程去搬运泥块，谁违抗命令，就以“越共”、“背叛国家”的“罪名”施加毒刑和迫害。
