Xinhua News Agency, 5th -- Commercial departments in various regions are transferring large quantities of daily-use industrial products and winter-proof goods to rural areas to supply the peak season market. By mid-November, provinces and autonomous regions including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Sichuan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia had already distributed 80% of the winter goods planned for the fourth quarter to grassroots stores.

This year, the quantity of daily-use industrial products supplied to rural areas during the peak season is greater than in previous years, and the variety of designs and colors has also increased significantly. Shanghai's supply to various regions in the fourth quarter of this year, including general merchandise, cotton cloth, knitwear, medicine, etc., has increased by 10% compared to the same period last year. The supply of front-buttoned undershirts, which are always popular with farmers, has increased by more than 40% compared to last year. There are more than 400 new patterns for dark-colored printed cloth. The department stores in Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Suzhou, and Nantong in Jiangsu Province supply approximately 10,000 to 15,000 varieties of industrial products to rural areas.

When distributing goods, various regions first concentrated on supplying seasonal cold-weather supplies and essential daily necessities. Currently, the amount of thermal underwear, cotton-rubber shoes, fur hats, cotton blankets, scarves, matches, and thermos bottles distributed by the provinces accounts for more than 70% to 90% of the fourth-quarter supply plan. These cold-weather supplies were prepared early and are in sufficient supply. Cold regions such as Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Qinghai, and Xinjiang began planning the production of winter-proof supplies as early as August.

To ensure the supply of materials to rural areas, commercial departments in various regions have closely cooperated with industrial departments and taken a series of measures to strengthen the organization of goods sources. Since October, the purchase of daily-use industrial products has progressed rapidly, with significant results. Commercial departments in various regions have also strengthened contact with transportation departments, using return vehicles and vessels and carrying out incidental transportation to transport industrial products to rural areas ahead of schedule.

    供应农村旺季市场需要
    商业部门调运大批商品下乡
    新华社5日讯　各地商业部门调运大批日用工业品和冬季防寒用品下乡，供应农村旺季市场。到11月中旬，黑龙江、辽宁、四川、山东、山西、陕西、江苏、浙江、安徽、云南、内蒙古等省、区，准备在第四季度供应的冬令商品已有80％下放到基层商店。
    今年各地供应农村的旺季日用工业品数量比往年多，花色品种也显著增加。上海市今年第四季度供应各地的百货、棉布、针棉织品、药品等比去年同期增长一成，一向为农民喜爱的开襟卫生衫今年的供应量比去年上升40％以上。深色花布的新花样有四百多种。江苏省南京、常州、无锡、徐州、苏州、南通六个市的百货站供应农村的工业品的花色品种在一万至一万五千种左右。
    各地在下放商品时，首先集中力量投放当令的防寒用品和生活必需品。目前各省下放的卫生衣裤、棉胶鞋、皮帽子、棉毯、围巾、火柴、暖水瓶等，已占第四季度供应计划的70％至90％以上。这些防寒用品准备得早，货源充足。辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、山西、青海、新疆等寒冷地区早在8月份就开始安排冬季防寒用品的生产。
    为了保证农村物资供应，各地商业部门与工业部门密切协作，采取一系列措施加强了货源组织工作，从10月份以来日用工业品收购工作进展迅速，成绩显著。各地商业部门还和交通运输部门加强联系，通过利用回空车船和开展捎脚运输等多种办法，提前把工业品运往农村。
