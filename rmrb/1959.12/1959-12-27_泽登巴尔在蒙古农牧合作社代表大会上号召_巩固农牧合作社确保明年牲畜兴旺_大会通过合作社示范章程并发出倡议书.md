Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 25th: The second Mongolian Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperative Congress concluded this afternoon after four days of speeches and discussions.

Tsendenbal, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered the closing address. He said: Thanks to the victory of cooperative organizations in pastoral areas, our country's economy has become a complete socialist economy. Cooperativization has eliminated the decentralized and backward forms of economic organization and is the only correct path for herders to embark on socialist development. He said that the Party Central Committee and the government call on all members of the cooperatives to develop the cooperatives into economic departments with huge incomes.

He said that animal husbandry used to be the only basic sector of our economy, but this situation has now changed. New agricultural production sectors have emerged in pastoral areas. With the help of the Soviet Union, the task of land reclamation, which is of great significance to the national economy, was successfully completed this year. Grain production reached more than 130,000 tons, averaging more than 130 kilograms per person.

Tsendenbal said that continuing to consolidate the cooperatives economically and organizationally is the primary task at present. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee pointed out that it is necessary to rationally arrange labor organization, implement the principle of distribution according to work, improve labor productivity, increase product output, increase income, and educate members with socialist labor concepts and collective ideas. To this end, it is necessary to give full play to the superiority of the collective economy.

He said that the Party Central Committee has decided to further strengthen the state's assistance to the cooperatives and expand the scope of state loans to the cooperatives. These measures have greatly encouraged the political and labor enthusiasm of the members.

Tsendenbal called on the cooperatives to complete the task of livestock breeding in 1960, and every cooperative should strive not to lose a single head of livestock; at the same time, it must complete the plan for paying livestock products.

Tsendenbal said that members should be settled down in the next few years, and the cultural revolution must be vigorously promoted.

He said that in two years, the people of our country will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the victory of the People's Revolution, and we should greet this festival with great achievements in the development of the national economy and culture.

He finally said that the Mongolian people and the people of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union bid farewell to 1959 with the brilliant achievements of socialism, and in a few days, we will enter 1960. He wished all members new achievements in the new year.

Before the closing ceremony, the Congress adopted the Model Charter of Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperatives and a call to action issued by the Congress to all cooperative members. The call to action requires all members to actively participate in labor, cherish public property, improve production technology, promote advanced experience, improve the management of livestock, improve livestock breeds, increase the number of livestock and livestock products, increase the yield of grain and vegetables, and develop sideline production. The call to action also requires members to abide by the Model Charter of the Cooperatives, learn from the working class to live, work and study in a socialist way, and move forward for the further development of the beautiful motherland.

　　泽登巴尔在蒙古农牧合作社代表大会上号召
    巩固农牧合作社确保明年牲畜兴旺
    大会通过合作社示范章程并发出倡议书
    新华社乌兰巴托25日电　蒙古第二届农牧业合作社代表大会经过四天的发言和讨论后，在今天下午闭幕。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记、部长会议主席泽登巴尔致闭幕词。他说：由于合作社组织在牧区取得胜利，我国经济已经变为完整的社会主义经济了。合作化消除了分散落后的经济组织形式，是使牧民走上社会主义的发展的唯一正确的道路。他说，党中央和政府号召全国社员把合作社发展成为有巨大收入的经济部门。
    他说，牧业曾经是我国经济的唯一基本部门，现在这种状况已经改变了。牧区出现了新的农业生产部门。在苏联帮助下，今年顺利实现了对国民经济具有重要意义的开荒任务。粮食生产达到十三万多吨，平均每人达到一百三十多公斤。
    泽登巴尔说，从经济上和组织上继续巩固合作社是当前的首要任务。党的四中全会指出要合理安排劳动组织、贯彻执行按劳分配原则、提高劳动生产率、提高产品产量、增加收入、以社会主义劳动观点和集体思想教育社员。为此必须充分发挥集体经济的优越性。
    他说，党中央决定将进一步加强国家对合作社的帮助，扩大国家对合作社的贷款范围。这些措施大大鼓舞了社员的政治和劳动积极性。
    泽登巴尔号召合作社完成1960年的牲畜增殖任务，每个社都应为不损失一头牲畜而奋斗；同时，必须完成缴纳畜产品的计划。
    泽登巴尔说，应当在今后几年内使社员们定居下来，必须大力推进文化革命。
    他说，再过两年，我国人民将要庆祝人民革命胜利四十周年，应以发展国民经济及文化的伟大成就来迎接这个节日。
    他最后说，蒙古人民和以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营各国人民以社会主义的光辉成就欢送1959年，再过几天就要跨入1960年了，祝全体社员在新的一年中取得新的成就。
    闭幕式前代表大会通过了农牧业合作社示范章程和大会向全体合作社社员发出的倡议书。倡议书要求全体社员积极参加劳动，爱护公共财产，提高生产技术，推广先进经验，改进牲畜的经营管理，改良牲畜品种，增加牲畜头数和畜产品，提高谷物和蔬菜的产量和发展副业生产。倡议书还要求社员们遵守合作社示范章程，向工人阶级学习按社会主义的方式生活、劳动和学习，为进一步发展美好的祖国向前迈进。
