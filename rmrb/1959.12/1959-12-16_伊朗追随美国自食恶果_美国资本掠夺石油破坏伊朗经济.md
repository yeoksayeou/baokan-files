    Tehran News: As a result of Iran's pursuit of the US policy of arms expansion and war preparation, its economic situation is deteriorating and the people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult.
    It is reported that in order to maintain an army of hundreds of thousands of people, Iran's annual military expenditure accounts for more than 40% of the national income. The military budget for the 1959-1960 fiscal year is as high as 12.2 billion rials (100 rials is approximately equal to 1.3 US dollars), which is double the amount before Iran joined the Baghdad Pact (now the Central Treaty Organization) in 1955-1956. According to a recent report by the Associated Press, the United States has given Iran 330 million US dollars in military "aid" in the past 12 years, which is only enough for Iran to maintain its military expenditure for just over two years. At the same time, American capital is using "aid" to Iran to intensify its infiltration. The "Azerbaijan People's Opinion" wrote that the Iranian National Oil Company, like other economic sectors in Iran, is manipulated by American bigwigs. The American "Pan American Petroleum Corporation" controls 16,000 square kilometers of oil areas in Iran. According to the figures published by the international oil cartel itself, the international oil consortium extracted nearly 500 million US dollars in staggering profits from Iran in 1958; this figure is more than half of Iran's national budget for 1957-1958.
    In addition to oil monopoly capital, other American monopoly organizations have also invaded Iran on a large scale. The Western American consortium's "Hawaiian Sugar Company" and "Parsons Company" have monopolized Iran's sugar industry. Iran's seven-year agricultural development plan is also being implemented by New York's "Development and Resources Corporation" on behalf of the Iranian government. The Kerman region in Iran, which is rich in chromium and coal, will be exclusively operated by the "Kerman Development Company," which is composed of American monopoly capital.
    Under the plunder of the United States and other foreign capital, Iran's economy is deteriorating. "Islamic Spark" wrote that Iran used to be a country that exported grains, oils, agricultural products and livestock products, but now it has to import food from abroad. The newspaper pointed out that Iran's situation in exporting carpets and cotton is also very bad. The dumping of foreign goods has dealt a fatal blow to Iran's national industry, resulting in a huge trade deficit for Iran. In 1957-1958, the trade deficit reached 16.9 billion rials.
    With the increase in military spending and the continuous deterioration of the economic situation, prices in Iran are rising every day, and the lives of the working people are difficult. The "Benefit News" wrote: Ordinary Iranians are satisfied as long as they can afford a few grams of meat and feed a family of seven or eight with thin porridge. In order not to starve to death, people spend their time looking for a small piece of bread.
    Due to extremely insufficient education funds, Iran's education is facing great difficulties. Iran's "Observer" pointed out that the national education funds should be 400 million rials, but the government only allocated 200 million rials. The newspaper wrote that due to the great reduction in education funds, the construction of affiliated hospitals of medical colleges in Isfahan, Shiraz, and Masjid, the 30 handicraft factories attached to schools, and the construction of four technical schools will be temporarily suspended this year.
    According to the Indian "Hindustan Times", there are currently 3.2 million school-age children in Iran, but only one-third of them are enrolled in school.

### 伊朗追随美国自食恶果  美国资本掠夺石油破坏伊朗经济

    伊朗追随美国自食恶果
    美国资本掠夺石油破坏伊朗经济
    本报讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗追随美国扩军备战政策的结果，经济情况日益恶化，人民生活困难加深。
    据报道，伊朗由于维持一支为数十多万人的军队，每年军费开支占到国家收入的40％以上。1959—1960财政年度的军事预算更高达一百二十二亿里亚尔，（一百里亚尔约合一点三美元）比1955—1956年度伊朗参加巴格达条约（即现在的中央条约组织）前增加一倍。据美联社最近透露，美国在过去十二年中给了伊朗三亿三千万美元的军事“援助”，这个数目只够伊朗维持两年多的军事开支。与此同时，美国资本利用对伊朗的“援助”，加紧渗入伊朗。“阿塞拜疆民意报”写道，伊朗国家石油公司同伊朗其他经济部门一样，是由美国大人先生们操纵的。美国的“泛美石油公司”控制了伊朗一万六千平方公里的石油区。据国际石油卡特尔自己公布的数字，1958年国际石油财团从伊朗榨取了将近五亿美元的惊人利润；这个数字比伊朗1957—1958年度的国家预算还要多出一半多。
    除了石油垄断资本外，美国的其他垄断组织也大举侵入伊朗。美国西部财团的“夏威夷糖公司”和“巴逊氏公司”已经垄断了伊朗的制糖业。伊朗的农业发展七年计划，也是由纽约的“开发与资源公司”代表伊朗政府执行的。伊朗盛产铬和煤的基尔曼地区，将由美国垄断资本组成的“基尔曼开发公司”独揽经营。
    在美国和其他外国资本的掠夺下，伊朗经济每况愈下。“伊斯兰火花报”写道，伊朗过去是一个出口谷物、油类、农产品和畜产品的国家，而现在它却要从国外进口粮食。报纸指出，伊朗在出口地毯和棉花方面的情况也很糟糕。外国商品的倾销，使伊朗民族工业受到致命打击，从而给伊朗带来了巨大的贸易赤字，1957—1958年，贸易赤字达一百六十九亿里亚尔。
    在军费日增、经济状况不断恶化的情况下，伊朗物价天天上涨，劳动人民生活困难。“利益报”写道：普通伊朗人只要能够买得起几克肉，能以稀粥养活一个七、八口之家，他们就心满意足了。为了不致饿死，人们把自己的时间都用来寻找一小块面包。
    由于教育经费极为不足，伊朗教育事业遭到很大困难。伊朗“观察报”指出，国民教育经费本需四亿里亚尔，但是政府只拨给二亿里亚尔。这家报纸写道，由于教育经费大大减少，伊斯法罕、设拉子和麦斯吉德等地医学院附属医院的建筑、学校附设的三十个手工业工厂和四所工艺学校的建筑，今年都将暂时停工。
    据印度“印度斯坦时报”报道目前伊朗全国有三百二十万学龄儿童，但已经就学的只有三分之一。
