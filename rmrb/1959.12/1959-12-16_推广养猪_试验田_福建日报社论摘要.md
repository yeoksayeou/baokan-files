Promoting Pig Raising “Experimental Fields”
-- Abstract of Fujian Daily Editorial

The Fujian Daily published an editorial on December 4th entitled "Promoting Pig Raising 'Experimental Fields'". The abstract is as follows:

The experience of leading cadres at all levels in Lianjiang and Yongtai counties in vigorously developing pig raising "experimental fields," participating in pig raising, and leading pig raising is very good.

Rapidly developing the pig raising industry is a fundamental measure to solve the problem of farmland fertilizer and is a matter of policy and direction concerning agricultural production. Since the development of pig raising production has been elevated to an extremely important position, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over the pig raising cause. Over the long term, local Party committees have accumulated rich and complete experience in leading agriculture, but their experience in leading pig raising is still insufficient. Under these circumstances, emphasizing the vigorous development of pig raising "experimental fields," participating in pig raising, and leading pig raising is absolutely necessary. Because only through leading cadres at all levels going deep into pig farms and personally engaging in "experimental fields" can we quickly understand the laws of developing pig raising, quickly master the basic knowledge of pig raising, quickly discover and solve problems, and fully exert the Party's leading role. Yongtai County has implemented the method of "being a good feeder first, then a commander; being a feeder and a commander at the same time," which has achieved remarkable results. After Lianjiang County established pig raising experimental farms in every commune, cadres and the masses became one in the experimental farms. As soon as problems were discovered, they were studied, discussed, and resolved jointly with the masses. Advanced experiences in solving problems such as pig sources, feed, and pig sties were summarized in a timely manner and quickly promoted, enabling the number of pigs raised in the county to double in one hundred days. Moreover, leading cadres at all levels vigorously developing pig raising "experimental fields," participating in pig raising, and leading pig raising also plays a significant role in establishing a sense of honor in pig raising. Although many people currently love the pig raising cause, there are still some who believe that "there is no future in raising pigs," or who are afraid of dirt and odor and are not at ease in pig raising positions. However, when they see that leading cadres at all levels are also participating in pig raising, they will quickly eliminate all kinds of incorrect views, realize that pig raising is a glorious cause, and engage in pig raising labor with the greatest enthusiasm. Of course, in order to strengthen the Party's leadership over the pig raising industry, it is also necessary to take a series of powerful measures. For example, Party committees at all levels should establish leading organizations for pig raising production at each level, sending strong and capable cadres to lead pig raising production; adhere to putting politics in command in pig raising production, strengthening ideological education, and enhancing the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in developing the pig raising industry; correctly implement the policy of public raising as the mainstay and public-private joint development; plant red flags, establish pacesetters, and launch a movement to compare with, catch up with, and learn from the advanced in the pig raising industry; and so on.

Making every effort to develop the pig raising cause more quickly is a glorious and great task before us. Party members, Youth League members, and revolutionary cadres in all regions should unreservedly contribute their strength and wisdom to the high-speed development of the pig raising cause. Respond to the Party's battle call and go to the pig raising front! Participate in pig raising, lead pig raising, and fight heroically for the comprehensive prosperity of animal husbandry!

    推广养猪“试验田”
    ——福建日报社论摘要
    12月4日福建日报以推广养猪“试验田”为题发表社论。摘要如下：
    连江、永泰两县各级领导干部大搞养猪“试验田”，参加养猪、领导养猪的经验好得很。
    高速度发展养猪业是解决农田肥料的根本措施，是有关农业生产的方针性、方向性的问题。发展养猪生产既已提到极为重要的地位，就特别需要加强党对养猪事业的领导。长期以来各地党委对领导农业已经积累了丰富的完整的经验，但领导养猪的经验还不够。在这种情况下，强调大搞养猪“试验田”，参加养猪，领导养猪，是完全必要的。因为只有通过各级领导干部深入养猪场，亲自搞“试验田”，才能迅速摸清发展养猪的规律，迅速掌握养猪的基本知识，才能迅速发现问题解决问题，才能充分发挥党的领导作用。永泰县实行了“当好饲养员，再当司令员，一面当饲养员，一面当司令员”的办法，已经收到显著的效果。连江县社社建立养猪试验场以后，在试验场里，干部和群众打成一片，一发现问题就与群众共同研究，共同商量，共同解决，及时总结了许多解决猪源、饲料和猪舍等问题的先进经验，并迅速加以推广，使全县养猪头数在一百天内翻了一番。不仅如此，各级干部大搞养猪“试验田”，参加养猪，领导养猪，对树立养猪的光荣感也有很大作用。目前虽然许多群众是热爱养猪事业的，但也还有一些人认为：“养猪没有什么出息。”或者怕脏、怕臭，不安心于养猪工作岗位。而当他们看到各级领导干部也来参加养猪，就会很快扫除种种不正确的看法，认识到养猪是光荣的事业，以最大的热情从事养猪劳动。当然，为了加强党对养猪业的领导，还需要采取一系列的有力的措施。例如各级党委层层建立养猪生产的领导机构，派强有力的干部领导养猪生产；在养猪生产中坚持政治挂帅，加强思想教育，提高干部、群众发展养猪业的积极性；正确地贯彻公养为主、公私并举的方针；插红旗、树标兵，掀起养猪业的比先进、赶先进、学先进运动；等等。
    尽一切努力，使养猪事业更快地发展，这是摆在我们面前的一项光荣伟大的任务。各地党团员和革命干部都应义不容辞地为高速发展养猪事业贡献力量和智慧。响应党的战斗号召，到养猪前线去！参加养猪，领导养猪，为畜牧业的全面繁荣而英勇奋战吧！
