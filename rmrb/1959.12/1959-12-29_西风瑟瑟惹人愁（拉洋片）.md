Hey, peep show, peep show,
Take a look at the Western scenery,
The sighing west wind causes sorrow,
Wherever you look, darkness abounds.
Compose a few lines as explanation,
Look at the photos to know the details.

I.
　　Hey, this person is really strange,
　　Wearing a sign on their body:
　　"I am a good person, please hire me!"
　　Running around, no one pays attention.
　　In America, the bad guys enjoy themselves, the good guys suffer:
　　The big shots revel in extravagance, dead drunk,
　　The unemployed wander the streets with frowning faces!
　　Bragging about the prosperous economy of the gold dollar empire,
　　Hey, this photo is the annotation!

II.
　　Hey, look at two sickly giants on the stage,
　　You pull, I hit, fighting each other,
　　One walks with difficulty, body swaying,
　　One has a small head and a big body, panting hard.
　　Not because their bodies aren't suffering,
　　But to earn a little money to fill their bellies;
　　Not because they don't sympathize with each other's suffering,
　　But because life is forcing them!
　　This is a new trick of American bosses,
　　Racking their brains to make money.
　　Capitalism is a festering sore,
　　Hey, happiness is built on the suffering of others!

III.
　　Hey, looked at that one, look at this one,
　　This photo is famous,
　　American-made records shipped to West Germany,
　　Hitler's picture printed on the sleeve.
　　This war criminal's sins are monstrous, hated by everyone,
　　But some people regard him as a "hero" to promote,
　　Kowtowing three times in the morning and evening,
　　Burning incense morning and night,
　　Hey, depicting the ugly appearance of his disciples!

IV.
　　Hey, look at this person lying on the ground,
　　Strumming the strings, ding-dong.
　　Could it be that the chair was unstable and he fell to the ground?
　　Could it be that he is mentally disordered and lost his mind?
　　You can guess a thousand times, ten thousand times, you won't guess right,
　　He is America's famous Tony Crombie.
　　He's an old hand at playing vulgar music,
　　His pretentious posture is too absurd.
　　If you ask what American culture is like?
　　Hey, this is an example! (Attached photo)

　　西风瑟瑟惹人愁（拉洋片）
　　天马
　　嘿，拉洋片呀拉洋片，
　　西方景致看一看，
　　西风瑟瑟惹人愁，
　　抬头望处尽黑暗。
　　编几句词儿作说明，
　　要知底细瞧照片。
　　一
　　嘿，这个人真奇怪，
　　身上挂着一块牌：
　　“我是个好人，请雇用我！”
　　东奔西走没人理睬。
　　在美国是坏人享福好人遭灾：
　　老爷们花天酒地沉沉醉，
　　失业者愁眉苦脸街头漫徘徊！
　　夸什么金元帝国经济繁荣，
　　嘿，这照片就是注解！
　　二
　　嘿，你看两个病态巨人在台上，
　　你揪我打干一场，
　　一个是走路艰难身摇晃，
　　一个是头小身大喘气忙。
　　并非身体不痛苦，
　　赚点小钱饱肚肠；
　　并非同病不相怜，
　　只因生活逼的慌！
　　这是美国老板新花样，
　　挖空心思赚金洋。
　　资本主义是脓疮，
　　嘿，快乐建筑在别人痛苦上！
　　三
　　嘿，看了那张看这张，
　　这张照片有名堂，
　　美制唱片运到西德，
　　希特勒像片印在口袋上。
　　这战犯罪恶滔天人人恨，
　　偏有人当作“英雄”来宣扬，
　　晨昏三叩首，
　　早晚一炉香，
　　嘿，刻划出徒子徒孙丑模样！
　　四
　　嘿，你看这人躺地上，
　　手拨琴弦叮咚响。
　　莫非是椅子不稳跌下地？
　　莫非是他神经错乱失了常？
　　千猜万猜你猜不着，
　　他是美国鼎鼎大名特尼·康。
　　演奏下流音乐他是老手，
　　装腔作势姿态太荒唐。
　　若问美国文化怎么样？
　　嘿，这就是事例一桩！（附图片）
