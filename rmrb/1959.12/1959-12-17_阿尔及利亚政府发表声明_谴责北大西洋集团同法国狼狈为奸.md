Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, New York Dispatch: The Algerian Provisional Government delegation at the United Nations issued a statement on the results of the UN General Assembly vote on the Algerian question, stating that the Pakistani proposal did not receive a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly vote. This was "the result of the conspiracy and pressure of the North Atlantic Group, which, at the request of France, opposed the passage of any resolution (by the United Nations General Assembly)."

The statement said, "These pressures and conspiracies can only strengthen our belief that there can be no, and will be no, ceasefire in Algeria unless the two sides (France and the Algerian Provisional Government) reach an agreement on the conditions and guarantees for the realization of the Algerian people's right to self-determination."

The statement said that representatives of the vast majority of member states of the United Nations agree with the Algerian Provisional Government's view that preliminary negotiations on an Algerian ceasefire cannot be separated from the conditions for exercising the right to self-determination.

    阿尔及利亚政府发表声明
    谴责北大西洋集团同法国狼狈为奸
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：在联合国的阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团就联大关于阿尔及利亚问题的表决结果发表声明说，巴基斯坦提案在大会表决时没有得到三分之二多数，是“北大西洋集团阴谋和压力的结果，这个集团在法国要求下，反对（联合国大会）通过任何决议。”
    声明说，“这些压力和阴谋只能加强我们的信念：如果不是（法国和阿尔及利亚临时政府）双方就实现阿尔及利亚人民的自决权的条件和保证达成协议，在阿尔及利亚就不能有、并且也不会有停火。”
    声明说，联合国绝大多数会员国的代表同意阿尔及利亚临时政府的看法，即不能把讨论阿尔及利亚停火的预备谈判同履行自决权的条件分开。
