An Important Measure to Ensure High Quality, High Yield, Low Consumption, and Low Cost for Small Blast Furnaces
    Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory Uses Indigenous Method for Sintering, Turning Poor Ore into Rich Ore

    (Our newspaper, Jinan, 22nd dispatch) The Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory's smelting workshop, based on the requirements of "fine processing of coarse grains" and turning poor ore into rich ore, has recently created a complete set of experience in producing self-fluxing sintered ore using indigenous methods, increasing the ore powder grade from 51% to about 58%, thereby creating favorable conditions for small blast furnaces to achieve high quality, high yield, low consumption, and low cost.

    The two three-cubic-meter small blast furnaces in this workshop used to use all ore powder, but the ore powder generally contained about 30% of mud and impurities, so the grade was not high. In order to change this situation, they decided to use indigenous methods to sinter the ore powder. After continuous improvement, they finally created a complete set of experience.

    The method of sintering ore powder using indigenous methods is very simple. There is no need to build furnaces or kilns. Just use sintered ore blocks to pave the furnace bottom on the ground, dividing it into two layers to form air ducts. Then, spread a layer of return ore fines on the furnace bottom to create the effect of dispersing the wind around. After the furnace bottom is paved, put seven to eight catties of firewood on it, and then sprinkle four to six catties of fine coke fines on the firewood, so you can start igniting and sending air, and gradually add materials upwards. The specific practices for sintering ore powder using indigenous methods that they have mastered are: First, the ore powder is strictly beneficiated and washed before sintering, and ore powders of different grades are stored, managed, and screened separately. They are also washed and selected through laboratory analysis in order to improve the ore powder grade. They generally carry out two water washing selections and one electromagnetic selection. After washing and selection, the ore powder grade is increased by about 10%. Second, before sintering, the ore powder, coke fines, lime, and coarse and fine return ore (coarse return ore is sintered material that failed to sinter during the sintering process, and fine return ore is fines after the sintered ore is crushed) are evenly mixed together in appropriate proportions. The formula is: 400 kilograms of concentrate powder, 100 kilograms of coarse return ore, 100 kilograms of fine return ore, 36 kilograms of coke fines, and 65 kilograms of lime per batch of material. They are layered and flattened, cut and put into a mixer for uniform mixing. The mixed material generally contains about 11% moisture. Third, strictly master the sintering operation technology. Add materials immediately after starting the ignition and sending air. When adding materials, they should be scattered frequently and evenly. The sintering time is generally four to five hours. Fourth, establish a strict shift handover system. They adopted the "three no acceptances" method: furnace bottom not clean, no acceptance; tools not complete, no acceptance; raw materials not complete, no acceptance. They also summarized and exchanged the experiences of each shift through pre-shift meetings and post-shift meetings, promoting the production of each shift.

    In the process of promoting the indigenous method of sintering ore powder, this workshop paid attention to mobilizing the masses to carry out technical innovation, adopting methods of simplifying according to leaks and using local materials to transform equipment and manufacture indigenous machines to replace manual operations. They have successively manufactured six kinds of machines, such as spiral ore powder washing machines, coke fines crushers, sintered ore crushers, and grading and screening linkage machines, basically realizing the mechanization or semi-mechanization of the sintering process, and significantly increasing labor productivity. For example, the spiral ore powder washing machine made by the workers from waste materials not only improved the ore powder grade, but also increased production efficiency by 33 times. The mixing machine they manufactured themselves achieved the requirement of uniform mixing and increased efficiency by more than three times.

    The advanced experience of this factory in sintering ore powder using indigenous methods has received the attention of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the leading departments such as the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Jinan Municipal Party Committee. Now, representatives from 26 provinces and cities have visited and learned from the experience of this factory. (Attached picture)

　　保证小高炉优质、高产、低耗、低成本的一项重要措施
    济南印染厂土法烧结　贫矿变富矿
    本报济南22日电　济南印染厂冶炼车间最近根据“粗粮细作”和变贫矿为富矿的要求，创造了一套完整的用土法生产自熔性烧结矿的经验，使矿粉品位由51％提高到58％左右，从而为小高炉实现优质、高产、低耗、低成本创造了良好条件。
    这个车间的两座三立方米小高炉，过去全部使用矿粉，而矿粉含泥土、杂质一般在30％左右，因此品位不高。为了改变这种状况，他们决定用土法来烧结矿粉。经过不断地改进，终于创造了一套完整的经验。
    土法烧结矿粉的方法很简便，不用兴建炉和窑，只需在平地上用烧结矿块铺成炉底，上下分两层，形成风道，然后在炉底上铺一层返矿末，以起向四周扩散风力的作用。炉底铺好后，在上面放七至八斤柴草，再在柴草上撒四至六斤的细焦末，这样就可以开始点火送风，并逐渐向上加料。他们掌握的土法烧结矿粉的具体作法是：第一，矿粉在烧结前经过严格的选矿和洗矿，品位不同的矿粉分别存放、分别管理、分别过筛使用，并且通过化验分析再进行洗选，以便提高矿粉品位。他们一般进行水洗选两遍，电磁选一遍。经过洗选，矿粉的品位提高10％左右。第二，烧结前把矿粉、焦末、石灰、粗细返矿（粗返矿是烧结过程中未能烧结的烧结料，细返矿是烧结矿破碎后的末子），以恰当的比例均匀地配在一起。配方是：每批料精矿粉四百公斤，粗返矿一百公斤，细返矿一百公斤，焦末三十六公斤，石灰六十五公斤。把它们分层平铺切取投入搅拌机内混合搅拌均匀，混合料内一般含水分11％左右。第三，严格掌握烧结操作技术。在开始点火送风后立即上料，上料时要撒得勤，撒得匀。烧结时间一般是四到五小时。第四，建立严格的交接班制度。他们采取“三不接”的办法：炉底不净不接，工具不全不接，原料不齐不接。他们还通过班前会、班后会总结交流各班的经验，推动了各班的生产。
    这个车间在推行土法烧结矿粉的过程中，注意发动群众大搞技术革新，采取因漏就简、就地取材的办法，改造设备和制造土机器来代替手工操作。他们先后制成了螺旋式矿粉淘洗机、焦末粉碎机、烧结矿粉碎机、分级分筛连动机等六种机器，基本上实现了烧结工序的机械化或半机械化，劳动生产率显著提高。例如，职工们用废旧材料制成的螺旋式矿粉淘洗机，不仅提高了矿粉品位，还提高生产效率三十三倍。他们自己制造的混料搅拌机，实现了混料均匀的要求，同时提高效率三倍以上。
    这个厂土法烧结矿粉的先进经验，受到了冶金工业部和中共山东省委、济南市委等领导部门的重视。现在，已有二十六个省市的代表先后参观学习了这个厂的经验。（附图片）
