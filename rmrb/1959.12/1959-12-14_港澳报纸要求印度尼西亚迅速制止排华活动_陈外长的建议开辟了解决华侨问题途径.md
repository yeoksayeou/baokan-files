Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 12th: Hong Kong and Macao's progressive newspapers today prominently published Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio regarding the anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia. "Ta Kung Pao," "Wen Wei Po," "Hong Kong Commercial Daily," and "Macao Daily News" also published editorials supporting the three-point suggestion made by Foreign Minister Chen in his letter for a comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue existing between China and Indonesia, and expressed the hope that the Indonesian authorities, placing the interests of the people of both China and Indonesia first, would swiftly halt the anti-Chinese activities and comprehensively resolve the overseas Chinese issue.

"Wen Wei Po," in an editorial titled "A Clear Path for Resolving the Indonesian Overseas Chinese Issue," stated that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's suggestion has opened a correct path and proposed practical and feasible methods for resolving the Indonesian Overseas Chinese issue as soon as possible. The editorial said that the Chinese government's suggestion fully complies with the spirit of Chinese-Indonesian friendship, the principles of the Bandung Conference, and the agreement reached during the foreign ministers' meeting in October. Following these three suggestions will fully respect both Indonesia's economic development and the legitimate rights and interests of the overseas Chinese. The realization of these three suggestions will further strengthen the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. The editorial pointed out, "Now is the critical moment for the governments of both countries to take measures."

"Ta Kung Pao," in an editorial titled "Chinese-Indonesian Relations Must Not Be Undermined," stated that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter is undoubtedly based on reason and principle, with clear distinctions. At the same time, it fully demonstrates that China is not only deeply concerned about protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the overseas Chinese but also, proceeding from the maintenance of Chinese-Indonesian friendship, has adopted a sincere attitude to resolve the problem. The newspaper expressed its full support for the Chinese government's solemn position and clear attitude. "Ta Kung Pao's" editorial also pointed out that Indonesia's anti-Chinese and anti-China activities violate Indonesia's founding principles and the interests of the Indonesian people. The editorial pointed out that the actions of a part of the forces in Indonesia that are trying to undermine the friendship between the two countries, "are exactly what the imperialists welcome and seek! But they are also deeply grieved by the people of both countries and all people of justice!" The newspaper hoped that the Indonesian authorities "will immediately send representatives to consult with our country in a spirit of friendship to comprehensively resolve the overseas Chinese issue."

The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily's" editorial pointed out that in Indonesia, "some political careerists with ulterior motives are taking the opportunity to make trouble and add fuel to the fire," "wholeheartedly wanting to undermine the good relations between the two countries." The editorial said: If this evil spirit is not suppressed by righteousness, the resolution of the Indonesian Overseas Chinese issue will encounter difficulties.

The "Macao Daily News" editorial stated that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's three suggestions are "timely and reasonable" and "very beneficial to both countries." The editorial also said that the Indonesian government has suffered a lot from imperialism and domestic right-wing forces in the past, and now everyone hopes that it will learn from the painful lessons and not be fooled by the enemy again on the overseas Chinese issue.

    港澳报纸要求印度尼西亚迅速制止排华活动
    陈外长的建议开辟了解决华侨问题途径
    新华社香港12日电　香港和澳门的进步报纸今天都以显著地位刊登了陈毅外长就印度尼西亚排华活动写给印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约的信件。“大公报”、“文汇报”、“商报”和“澳门日报”并发表社论，拥护陈外长在信件中提出的全面解决存在于中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的华侨问题的三点建议，并希望印度尼西亚当局能以中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的利益为重，迅速阻止排华活动，全面解决华侨问题。
    “文汇报”在题为解决印度尼西亚华侨问题有了通途的社论中说：陈毅外长的建议已经为及早解决印度尼西亚华侨问题开辟了正确途径，提出了实际可行的办法。社论说，我国政府的建议完全符合中国—印度尼西亚友好的精神，符合万隆会议的原则，符合两国外长10月会谈的协议。照这三点建议办事，就能完全做到既尊重印度尼西亚经济的发展又尊重华侨的正当权益。实现这三点建议，中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系将会得到进一步的加强。社论指出，“现在是两国政府采取措施的刻不容缓的时候。”
    “大公报”在题为中国—印度尼西亚关系不容破坏的社论中说，陈毅外长的信无疑是依情据理、原则分明的。同时充分表现了，我国既十分关切保护华侨的正当权益，又从维护中国—印度尼西亚两国友谊出发，采取了充满诚意解决问题的态度。这家报纸表示完全拥护和支持我国政府的严正立场和明确态度。“大公报”的社论还指出，印度尼西亚的反华排华活动，违反了印度尼西亚的立国原则、违反了印度尼西亚人民的利益。社论指出，印度尼西亚一部分力图破坏两国友谊的势力的做法，“正是帝国主义者所欢迎并且求之不得！但也正为两国人民和一切正义人士所痛心疾首！”这家报纸希望印度尼西亚当局“迅即派出代表，本友好精神，与我国协商全面解决华侨问题。”
    “商报”的社论中指出，印度尼西亚的“一些别有用心的政治野心家正在乘机捣乱，推波助澜”，“一心想破坏两国之间的良好关系”。社论说：这股邪气如果不被正气压下去，印度尼西亚华侨问题的解决是会遭受到困难的。
    “澳门日报”的社论说，陈毅外长的三点建议是“及时的、合理的”，而且“对两国都非常有利”。社论还说，印度尼西亚政府以往受过帝国主义和国内右翼势力不少的苦，现在大家都希望它接受惨痛教训，在华侨问题上，不要再上敌人的当。
