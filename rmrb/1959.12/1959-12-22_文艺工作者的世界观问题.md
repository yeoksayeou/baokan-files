The socialist literary and art cause in our country has achieved great success in the past decade. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction and driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, literature and art work has also seen a great leap forward. Our literary and art workers must follow the Party's literary and art line, hold high the banner of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, and continue to advance bravely.

For many literary and art workers, it is particularly important to continue improving their political and ideological level, thoroughly overcome the bourgeois worldview in their minds, and establish a proletarian worldview. Literary and art workers are sentinels of the Party on the ideological front, and the literary and art front is a very sensitive front in the class struggle. Some of our literary and art workers have not yet clearly distinguished between proletarian revolutionaries and bourgeois revolutionaries, and have not yet clearly distinguished between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. Those among them who are deeply influenced by the bourgeois worldview, including revisionists and right-leaning opportunists, have shown serious resistance to the great mass movement in this transformation. They attack the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement; in literature and art, they oppose the Party's correct literary and art line, negate the Party's leadership, negate the achievements of literary and art work, oppose the implementation of the General Line in literary and art work, and do their best to spread reactionary literary and art viewpoints.

Revisionists or right-leaning opportunists do not regard the literary and art cause as the Party's cause, but as a personal cause; they do not regard reflecting the great socialist era as their glorious responsibility, but under the guise of "writing the truth," they specialize in searching for so-called "dark sides" and describing trivial matters around them; they do not want Marxist class analysis, but use abstract "human nature theory" and "humanitarianism" to view life and describe life, attempting to negate the Party spirit principle of proletarian literature and art.

Comrade Mao Zedong once said that our literature and art are powerful weapons for "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy." Right-leaning opportunists in the literary and art ranks are exactly the opposite of us; they emphasize so-called "creative freedom"; they use various excuses to oppose political leadership over literature and art; they attack the Party's literary and art line as "one-sidedly emphasizing politics and neglecting artistry"; they slander the large number of excellent works produced since 1958 as "full of boring political preaching"; they adopt a aristocratic, lord-like attitude towards mass creations that reflect the revolutionary enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the working people generated in the Great Leap Forward; they one-sidedly emphasize the particularity of art, mystify the laws of art, and use this to oppose the Party's leadership over literary and art work.

Revisionists or right-leaning opportunists also want to scare the Party and the masses with the particularity of literature and art, they always say that the artistry of our works is not enough. In fact, this is not a question of whether the artistry is enough, but a divergence of two different artistic viewpoints and artistic tastes. Their slander of many of our works is precisely because these works have a full revolutionary spirit and a clear mass style, which fully demonstrates their class prejudice.

They oppose the Party's principle of unity of political and artistic standards. But they don't really want to abandon politics; they just don't want the Party's leadership, don't want proletarian politics, but want bourgeois politics. They describe the communist ideals reflected in our works as "boring political preaching," but this is precisely the soul of our literature and art, and something we must adhere to and greatly promote, simply because it does not conform to their bourgeois tastes, so they are particularly disgusted and wantonly attack it.

Our Party emphasizes politics first, but has never neglected the importance of artistry. Works lacking artistry, no matter how strong their political character, are not infectious. Only works that unite revolutionary political content and perfect artistic form can better play the role of educating the people.

When we say that literature and art should serve politics, we mean that literature and art work must be consistent in its political direction, but at the same time, we advocate the diversity of artistic styles. What we emphasize is the combination of this political consistency and artistic diversity. The "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy put forward by the Party is to achieve this goal and to more rapidly prosper and develop our socialist literature and art.

There are also some writers who are not interested in or turn a blind eye to the mainstream of the times, the thousands of new people and new things emerging in the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, saying that there is nothing to write about; and when someone writes about them, they point fingers and say that this and that is "untrue." In their view, the new figures emerging under the encouragement of the General Line, as well as the communist spirit and heroic style of these new figures, are hypocritical "affectations." What interests them are those so-called "dark" things. Under the guise of pursuing "truth," they take a magnifying glass and look for shortcomings and problems everywhere; they are fascinated by some trivial and vulgar little things, thinking that these are the "real" things, and deliberately describe them. In this way, they exaggerate small things and diminish real major events, resulting in a serious distortion of the face of our socialist society.

From our point of view, since literature and art are a noble cause of educating the masses, it should of course focus on reflecting issues and events of great significance to the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Today, this means the Great Leap Forward, the people's communes, and the countless heroic figures emerging in these movements. Obviously, these are the greatest truths.

The bourgeois viewpoint in literature and art is the manifestation of the bourgeois political viewpoint in literature and art. One of the most hypocritical and deceptive things spread by right-leaning opportunists in their works and literary and art reviews is the so-called "humanitarianism" and "theory of human nature." Comrade Mao Zedong thoroughly refuted this kind of fallacy long ago in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," pointing out that: "There is only concrete human nature, there is no abstract human nature. In a class society, there is only human nature with class character, and there is no human nature beyond class." He also said that the so-called human nature of some bourgeois intellectuals "is essentially nothing more than bourgeois individualism, and therefore, in their eyes, the human nature of the proletariat does not conform to human nature."① The human nature theorists of today are exactly the same as the human nature theorists of the past. They always say that our works reflecting new figures and praising the spirit of collectivism have "too little human touch" or "lack human nature."

Humanitarianism was first proposed by bourgeois thinkers during the Renaissance, and it played a progressive role in history. But even then, the obvious bourgeois nature of this humanitarianism could be seen. Those earliest humanitarians also looked down on the working masses and even adopted a hostile attitude towards the working masses. The bourgeoisie's cruel plunder and oppression of the working people throughout its entire development is a sharp satire of their humanitarianism. Now, who is the target of the "humanitarianism" put forward by the bourgeoisie and revisionists? It is not aimed at feudalism, nor at capitalism, but at socialism. First of all, they oppose socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat under the banner of humanitarianism. They describe the socialist need to carry out class struggle and eliminate capitalism and all private ownership systems as "inhumane." Secondly, they promote individualism, oppose collectivism, pit the individual against the collective, and promote that the collective harms individual freedom, individuality, etc. It can be seen that their so-called humanitarianism is actually nothing more than the manifestation of the bourgeois view of freedom, equality, and fraternity in literature and art. The great proletarian writer Gorky made the most scathing criticism of the hypocrisy of bourgeois humanitarianism, and at the same time, believed that our humanitarianism is "the true, all-human, proletarian humanitarianism—the purpose of this humanitarianism is to completely liberate the working people of all races and nations from the iron fist of capital."② When the system of man exploiting man still exists in the world, instead of opposing this system, but covering it up and protecting it, this is obviously just the hypocritical humanitarianism of the bourgeoisie.

Carrying out the struggle against the bourgeois worldview with the proletarian worldview in the literary and art circles is still a long-term and serious task. To completely abandon the bourgeois worldview and truly establish the proletarian worldview, it is necessary to seriously study Marxism-Leninism, seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, and go deep into the masses and become one with them. Our Party has always believed that the study of Marxist-Leninist theory must be linked to the current revolutionary practice. Therefore, our literary and art workers must actively participate in this struggle against right-leaning opportunism, draw a clear line with the bourgeois worldview, and improve their awareness.

The current task of our entire literary and art work, like other fronts, is to oppose the right, encourage vigor, strive for a greater leap forward in literary and art work, improve the combat effectiveness of literature and art, so that it can better encourage the revolutionary enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the working people, and better serve our Party's General Line.

　　文艺工作者的世界观问题
　　闻师润
    我国社会主义的文学艺术事业，十年来取得了很大的成绩。特别是1958年以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进的推动下，文学艺术工作也出现了一个大跃进的局面。我们的文艺工作者必须沿着党的文艺路线，高举毛泽东文艺思想的旗帜，继续勇敢地前进。
    对于许多文艺工作者说来，继续提高自己的政治思想水平，彻底克服自己头脑中的资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观是特别重要的一件事。文艺工作者是党在思想战线上的哨兵，文艺战线是阶级斗争中很敏感的战线。我们有一些文艺工作者，还没有划清无产阶级革命家跟资产阶级革命家的界限，还没有划清无产阶级世界观跟资产阶级世界观的界限。他们中的那些深受资产阶级世界观影响的人，包括修正主义者和右倾机会主义者，在这次变革中表现出对伟大的群众运动的严重抵触。他们攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社化运动；在文艺上则反对党的正确文艺路线，否定党的领导，否定文艺工作的成绩，反对在文艺工作中贯彻总路线，并尽力散布反动的文艺观点。
    修正主义者或右倾机会主义者不是把文艺事业看作党的事业，而是看作个人的事业；他们不是以反映伟大的社会主义时代作为自己的光荣职责，而是打着“写真实”的幌子，专门寻找所谓“阴暗面”，专门描写身边琐事；他们不要马克思主义的阶级分析，而用抽象的“人性论”“人道主义”观点来看生活，描写生活，企图否定无产阶级文学艺术的党性原则。
    毛泽东同志早就说过，我们的文艺是“团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人，消灭敌人”的有力武器。文艺队伍中的右倾机会主义者跟我们恰恰相反，他们强调所谓“创作自由”；他们用种种借口反对政治领导文艺；他们攻击党的文艺路线是“片面地强调政治，忽视艺术性”；诬蔑1958年以来产生的大量优秀作品“充满了枯燥无味的政治说教”；对在大跃进中产生的反映劳动人民的革命干劲和生产热情的群众创作，采取贵族老爷式的态度；他们片面强调艺术的特殊性，把艺术的规律神秘化，以此来反对党对文艺工作的领导。
    修正主义者或右倾机会主义者还想以文艺的特殊性来吓唬党、吓唬群众，他们总是说我们的作品的艺术性不够。其实，这里并不是什么艺术性够不够的问题，而是两种不同的艺术观点和艺术趣味的分歧问题。他们对我们的许多作品的诬蔑，正是因为这些作品具有充沛的革命精神和鲜明的群众风格，这就充分表现了他们的阶级偏见。
    他们反对党的政治标准和艺术标准统一的原则。但是他们也并不是真的不要政治，他们只是不要党的领导，不要无产阶级的政治，而要的是资产阶级的政治。他们把我们作品中所反映的共产主义理想说成是“枯燥无味的政治说教”，其实这正是我们的文艺的灵魂，是我们必须坚持和大加发扬的东西，只因为跟他们的资产阶级口味不合，所以他们就特别反感，肆意攻击。
    我们党强调政治第一，但从来也没有忽视艺术性的重要意义。缺少艺术性的作品，无论政治性怎样强，也是没有感染力的。只有革命的政治内容和完美的艺术形式统一的作品，才能更好地起到教育人民的作用。
    我们说文艺要服从政治，这是说文艺工作在政治方向上必须一致，但是我们同时又提倡艺术风格的多样性，我们强调的就是这种政治的一致性和艺术的多样性的结合。党所提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针就是为了达到这个目的，为了更迅速地繁荣和发展我们的社会主义的文学艺术。
    还有这样一些作家，他们对于时代的主流，对于大跃进和人民公社化运动中涌现出来的千千万万的新人新事，不感兴趣，或者视而不见，说是没有东西可写；而当有人写出来了时，他们就指手划脚地说这样那样“不真实”。在他们看来，在总路线鼓舞下涌现出来的新人物，以及这些新人物的共产主义气概和豪迈的风格是虚伪的“矫情”。他们所感兴趣的是那些所谓“阴暗”的东西。他们在追求“真实”的幌子下，拿着放大镜到处寻找缺点和岔子；他们对一些琐屑的、庸俗的小事情感到津津有味，认为这些才是“真实”的东西，而加以刻意描写。他们就是这样把渺小的事物夸大，而把真正的大事缩小，结果就严重歪曲了我们社会主义社会的面貌。
    从我们的观点看来，文艺既然是教育群众的崇高事业，当然就要着重反映对亿万人民的生活有重大意义的问题和事件。这在今天就是大跃进、人民公社和在这些运动中涌现出来的无数英雄人物，显然，这些才是最大的真实。
    文艺上的资产阶级观点是资产阶级政治观点在文艺方面的表现。右倾机会主义者在他们的作品中和文艺评论中，所散布的一个最虚伪最能迷惑人的东西，便是所谓“人道主义”和“人性论”。对于这类的谬论，毛泽东同志在他的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中早就彻底驳斥过，他指出：“只有具体的人性，没有抽象的人性。在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性。”他又说，有些资产阶级知识分子所谓的人性，“实质上不过是资产阶级的个人主义，因此在他们眼中，无产阶级的人性就不合于人性。”①现在的人性论者和过去的人性论者完全一样，他们总是说我们反映新人物、歌颂集体主义精神的作品“人情味太少”或者“缺少人性”。
    人道主义最初是由文艺复兴时期的资产阶级思想家所提出的，它在历史上曾经起过进步的作用。但是即使在那时，也可以看出这个人道主义的明显的资产阶级性质。那些最早的人道主义者，也是看不起劳动群众，甚至对于劳动群众采取敌视态度的。资产阶级在它的整个发展过程中，对劳动人民的残酷的掠夺和压迫，更是对它们的人道主义的一个尖锐的讽刺。现在资产阶级和修正主义者提出“人道主义”，其锋芒是对着谁的呢？对着的不是封建主义，也不是资本主义，而是社会主义。首先他们是在人道主义的招牌下，反对社会主义革命和无产阶级专政。他们把社会主义要进行阶级斗争，要消灭资本主义和一切私有制度，说成是“不人道”。其次他们宣传个人主义，反对集体主义，把个人和集体对立起来，宣传什么集体损害个人的自由、个性等等。可见他们所说的人道主义，实际上不过是资产阶级的自由、平等、博爱观点在文艺上的表现罢了。无产阶级的伟大作家高尔基对于资产阶级人道主义的虚伪性作了最痛烈的抨击，同时，认为我们的人道主义才是“真正的、全人类的、无产阶级的人道主义，——这个人道主义的目的是把一切种族和民族的劳动人民从资本的铁掌中完全解放出来。”②当世界上还存在着人剥削人的制度的时候，不是去反对这种制度，而是去掩盖、保护它，这显然只是资产阶级的虚伪的人道主义。
    在文艺界进行以无产阶级世界观反对资产阶级世界观的斗争，还是一个长期的严重的任务。要彻底抛弃资产阶级世界观、真正确立无产阶级世界观，便必须认真地学习马克思列宁主义，认真地学习毛泽东思想，并且深入群众，和群众打成一片。我们党一向认为，学习马克思列宁主义的理论必须和当前的革命实践联系起来。因此，我们的文艺工作者要积极投入这次反对右倾机会主义的斗争，跟资产阶级世界观划清界限，提高自己的觉悟。
    我们整个文艺工作的当前任务，跟其他各个战线一样，就是反右倾、鼓干劲，争取文艺工作更大的跃进，提高文学艺术的战斗力，使之更好地鼓舞劳动人民的革命热情和生产热情、更好地为我们党的总路线服务。
