Vigorously Eliminate Overwintering Pests
Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Henan Provinces Collaborate to Control Wheat Stripe Rust

Xinhua News Agency News: At present, people's communes in various regions are vigorously eliminating overwintering pests in farmland. Areas in Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces (regions) where wheat stripe rust has been found are also stepping up prevention and control efforts.

This year, due to summer and autumn drought, crop pests are more serious than in previous years. To eliminate overwintering pests, various regions have strengthened inspection and control work. According to inspections by the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture on some cottonseed, there are 50 to 100 overwintering pink bollworms per jin. The Ciyuan Information Station in Yizhang County, Hunan Province, inspected harvested late-rice fields and found 21 overwintering larvae of rice stem borers in 30 rice stubbles. In addition, inspections of 6 square feet of weeds revealed 106 leafhoppers. The secretary of the Chen County Party Committee dug up 11 rice stubbles in the paddy fields of Fengyang Chengguan Commune and found 75 overwintering rice borers. Starting in early November, Chenzhou Prefecture in Hunan Province launched a "Three Cleans" campaign (digging up all stubble, picking up all stubble, and burning all stubble) and weeding to eliminate overwintering rice borers and other pests. Currently, over 3.6 million mu of rice fields in this prefecture have achieved the "Three Cleans," and insecticide lime and tea bran have been added to winter paddy fields in over 800,000 mu. More than 7.2 million mu of rice fields in the four prefectures of Ganzhou, Ji'an, Jiujiang, and Yichun in Jiangxi Province have achieved the "Three Cleans." Quanjiao, Lai'an and other places in Anhui are also seizing the time to destroy rice roots. Cotton-growing areas are vigorously eliminating overwintering pink bollworms. In addition to vigorously removing cotton stalks, Hubei Province is also promoting the "Four Concentrations" (concentrated picking of cotton, drying of cotton, storage of cotton, and management of tools) and "Four Treatments" (treating storage warehouses, cottonseed, tools, and dry bolls) methods from Huangmei County, and has established special pest control warehouses (walls inside, pillars outside, and walls not connected to the eaves) to thoroughly eliminate overwintering pink bollworms. In Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province, in addition to mobilizing the masses to dry cotton and control pink bollworms, special pest control warehouses have also been established. Anhui, Shandong and other places have also launched mass campaigns to prevent and control overwintering pink bollworms. In addition, many areas have also combined silage, manure accumulation, autumn plowing, and deep plowing to eliminate overwintering pests hidden in corn stalks, corn cob cores, various wild vegetables, weeds, and soil.

In some areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang and other provinces (regions), wheat fields have experienced varying degrees of stripe rust due to higher temperatures and soil moisture since the beginning of winter. Leaf rust has also occurred in Shandong, Henan and other provinces. Currently, disease-stricken areas have made rust prevention an important part of winter wheat field management. People's communes in various regions are mobilizing the masses to conduct general surveys of wheat fields, simultaneously inspecting for rust, eliminating rust, and preventing rust. To control the spread and prevention of large-scale stripe rust, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Henan provinces have recently established joint prevention and collaboration relationships, and collaborative prevention activities are gradually unfolding. Shaanxi Province has established prevention and control command organizations in areas where stripe rust has occurred, increased disease monitoring points, trained technicians, and adopted methods such as burying soil and cutting leaves, and spraying pesticides for prevention and control. By mid-November, the province had carried out prevention and control measures in 78% of wheat fields with stripe rust. Gansu Province has been proactive and rapid in its stripe rust prevention and control work. In addition to carrying out a general prevention and control effort in wheat fields where stripe rust has occurred, it has also implemented prevention measures in over one million mu of wheat fields. Xinjiang used airplanes to spray pesticides to control wheat stripe rust and wheat aphids and other diseases and insect pests.

### 大力消灭越冬虫害  陕甘晋豫四省协作除治小麦条锈病

    大力消灭越冬虫害
    陕甘晋豫四省协作除治小麦条锈病
    新华社讯　目前各地人民公社正大力除治农田的越冬害虫。陕西、甘肃等省（区）部分发现小麦条锈病的地区也正在加紧防治。
    今年由于夏秋干旱，农作物虫害较往年严重。为了消灭越冬害虫，各地加强了检查和除治工作。据湖北省农业厅检查一部分棉籽，一斤内有越冬红铃虫五十到一百头。湖南宜章县粟源情报站在已收割的晚秋田内检查，三十个禾蔸就有三化螟越冬幼虫二十一条；另外检查六平方尺游草中有浮尘子一百零六个。郴县地委书记在丰阳城关公社稻田中挖了十一个禾蔸，就发现了七十五个越冬螟虫。从11月上旬开始，湖南郴县专区就展开了“三光”（挖光、拣光、烧光禾蔸）和锄光杂草，消灭越冬螟虫等害虫的工作。现在，这个专区已有三百六十多万亩稻田做到了“三光”，并在八十多万亩稻田的冬凼中掺入了杀虫的石灰和茶枯。江西省赣南、吉安、九江、宜春四个专区已有七百二十多万亩稻田做到了“三光”。安徽全椒、来安等地也在抓紧时机消毁稻根。棉区都在大力消灭越冬的红铃虫。除大力拔除棉秆外，湖北省还在推广黄梅县的四集中（集中收花、晒花、贮花、工具）、四处理（处理贮花仓库、棉子、工具、枯铃）办法，建立了除虫专仓（墙在内、柱在外、墙顶不接檐），彻底消灭越冬红铃虫。陕西盩厔县除发动群众晒花除治红铃虫外，也建立了防虫的专仓。安徽、山东等地也都开展了群众性的防治越冬红铃虫活动。此外，许多地区还结合青贮、积肥、秋耕、深翻等工作，消灭了潜藏在玉米秸、玉米穗轴、各种野菜野草及土壤中的越冬害虫。
    陕西、甘肃、新疆等省（区）的部分地区，由于入冬以来气温较高，土壤湿度较大，麦田有不同程度的条锈病发生。山东、河南等省也有叶锈病发生。目前发病地区已把防治锈病作为冬季麦田管理的重要内容。各地人民公社都在发动群众普查麦田，边查锈、边灭锈、边防锈。为了控制大面积条锈病的传播和防治，陕西、甘肃、山西、河南四省最近已建立了联防协作关系，协作防治活动正在逐步展开。陕西省在发生条锈病地区建立了防治指挥机构、增设病情测报点，培训技术员，采取埋土切叶、喷撒农药等办法防治。到11月中旬全省已在78％有条锈病的麦田进行了防治。甘肃省条锈病防治工作抓得早，进度快，除在发生条锈病麦田里普遍进行了一次防治工作外，还在一百多万亩麦田里作了预防。新疆用飞机喷药防治了小麦条锈病和麦蚜等病虫害。
