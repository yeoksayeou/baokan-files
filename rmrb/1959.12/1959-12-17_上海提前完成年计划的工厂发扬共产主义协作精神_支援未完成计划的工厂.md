Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 16th (Reporter Zhou Yongkang): Many factories in Shanghai that have completed their annual plans ahead of schedule are using a valuable spirit of communist collaboration to fully support factories that have not yet completed their plans, so that they can complete their annual production tasks more quickly and comprehensively.

Organizing factories that have completed their plans ahead of schedule to help factories that have not completed their plans is an important measure currently being taken by many industrial sectors in Shanghai to ensure that the entire industry comprehensively and overfulfills its plans. In order to complete key products such as various large machine tools and forging equipment on schedule, the machine tool industry has organized 29 factories that have completed this year's plan into seven collaboration groups to support the seven machine tool factories with large tasks this year but have not yet completed their plans. Industries such as general machinery, petroleum machinery, construction hardware, and welding are also adopting this method of large-scale collaboration within the industry to ensure the completion of plans for the entire industry. Some factories in the Mechanical Industry Bureau system that have completed this year's mechanical production tasks are also helping factories under the Motor Industry Bureau across industries, rushing to produce a batch of special products such as gear reduction motors and explosion-proof motors urgently needed by coal mines and chemical plants.

Mutual support between various industries basically takes two forms. One is to send people out to provide on-site assistance; the other is to accept tasks and process them in the factory.

Practice over this period in various industries has proven that mobilizing factories that have completed their plans to support other factories in completing their plans can achieve good results. On the one hand, when these factories support others, because their own plans have been completed, they have no "worries," and can invest more effort in collaboration, with everyone full of energy and more focused. On the other hand, most of the factories that have completed their plans are advanced factories in the industry, and have accumulated a lot of experience in technological innovation and business management. Therefore, when assisting others, they not only support manpower and equipment, but also improve the management level and technical level of these factories that have not completed their plans through experience exchange, creating favorable conditions for these factories to continue their great leap forward in the future. For example, the Qunxing Machinery Factory, which was recently established by merging five small factories in the first half of this year, recently accepted a batch of paper machine production tasks. There were some difficulties in terms of manpower, equipment, and technology. After learning about this, the Shanghai Advanced Collective – Hefengyong Machinery Factory, led by the factory director, organized a working team of more than 30 people to help Qunxing Factory solve many weak links in production and management; some factories also sent experienced veteran workers to serve as technical instructors to help them master the manufacturing technology of this paper machine. With the strong support from all sides, Qunxing Factory's production has been rising sharply. Of the 241 paper machine mainframes and auxiliary machines, only more than 60 were completed in the first two or three months, but nearly 90 have been completed in the past 20 days or so, and the main components of more than 80 others have also been basically completed, and all can be completed before the end of the year.

Factories supporting others are sparing no effort, and factories receiving assistance are working even harder. With the help of all parties, factories that have not yet completed their annual plans have further strengthened their confidence in completing their plans, and are grasping production in the last ten days or so even more tightly. Leading cadres of the Shanghai Forging Machine Tool Factory are grasping progress every day, arranging scheduling, and organizing special personnel to be responsible for collaborative parts. Workers at the Press Machine Tool Factory also actively carried out technological innovation activities, transforming the native vertical lathe into a gantry grinder to replace manual processing of flat plates for hydraulic presses, increasing efficiency by more than seven times. The Fa Chang Machine Factory, which is the key support target, is also working hard and going all out. The task of paper machines has been completed by about 90%.

Factories that are helping others to complete their plans, seeing that brother factories are still working hard to ensure the completion of the plans of the entire industry, have also further promoted their own production. Although many factories have transferred some manpower and equipment to support brother factories, the workers in the factory have proposed the goal of "less people but no less work," and continue to vigorously carry out technological innovation and tap production potential. After the Dahua Glass Instrument Factory helped the thermos bottle factory with one-tenth of its capacity, the workers continued to work hard, and production in the first ten days of December increased by about 10% compared with the first ten days of November before the support.

Many factories that have completed their plans with assistance are now also sending people out to help other factories that have not completed their plans. Jin Xing Gold Pen Factory had a relatively poor plan completion in the first half of the year due to raw material supply. Recently, with the normal supply of raw materials and insufficient manpower, relevant departments transferred a group of workers from some sock factories to it. In mid-November, after Jin Xing Factory completed its own plan, it heard that the Taikang Food Factory, which produces canned food, was unable to process the fruit raw materials that were pouring in in large quantities, and immediately drew more than 60 workers to help rush the work.

### 上海提前完成年计划的工厂发扬共产主义协作精神  支援未完成计划的工厂

    上海提前完成年计划的工厂发扬共产主义协作精神
    支援未完成计划的工厂
    据新华社上海16日电　记者周永康报道：上海许多已经提前完成今年计划的工厂以可贵的共产主义协作精神，从各方面全力帮助还没有完成计划的工厂都能更快地全面完成年度生产任务。
    组织提前完成计划的工厂帮助没有完成计划的工厂，这是上海许多工业部门当前保证整个行业全面超额完成计划的一项重要措施。机床工业为了如期完成各种大型机床和锻压设备等重点产品，把已经完成今年计划的二十九家工厂组织了七个协作组，分别支援今年任务大但还未完成计划的七家机床厂。通用机械、石油机械、建筑五金、电焊等行业，也在行业内部采取这种大协作的办法来保证全业完成计划。机械工业局系统有一部分完成了今年机械生产任务的工厂，还跨行业帮助电机工业局所属工厂，突击一批当前煤矿、化工厂急需的齿轮减速电机和防爆电机等特种产品。
    各行各业的互相支援，基本上采取了两种形式。一种是派人出去，上门相助；一种是接受任务，在厂加工。
    各行业经过这段时间的实践证明：发动已经完成计划的工厂支援别的工厂完成计划，可以收到很好的效果。一方面是这些工厂在支援别人时，因为自己计划已经完成，没有“后顾之忧”，可以用更多的力量投入协作，劲头个个十足，精力更加集中，另一方面，在完成计划的工厂中，大部分都是行业中的先进工厂，无论在技术革新还是企业管理等方面，都积累了不少经验，因而在协助别人时，不但支援了人力、设备，还通过经验交流，提高了这些没有完成计划工厂的管理水平和技术水平，为这些厂以后的继续大跃进创造了有利条件。例如今年上半年由五个小厂合并建成的群星机械厂，最近接受了一批造纸机的生产任务，在人力、设备、技术方面都存在着一些困难，上海市先进集体——和丰涌机器厂知道后，由厂长亲自挂帅，组织了一支三十多人的工作队，帮助群星厂解决了生产上、管理上的许多薄弱环节；还有些工厂派有经验的老师傅前来担任技术指导，帮助他们掌握这种造纸机的制造技术。群星厂在四面八方的大力支持下，生产直线上升。二百四十一台造纸机的主机和辅机，前两三个月只完成六十多台，最近二十多天内完成了近九十台，另外八十多台的主要部件也已基本上赶齐，在年底前可以全部完成。
    支援别人的工厂不遗余力，受人帮助的工厂更是加倍努力。尚未完成全年计划的工厂在各方面的帮助下，进一步坚定了完成计划的信心，对最后十多天的生产抓得更紧了。上海锻压机床厂领导干部每天抓进度，安排调度，组织专人负责协作配件。压力机床厂职工还积极开展技术革新活动，把土立车改为龙门磨床，代替手工加工油压机的平板，效率提高了七倍多。被作为重点支援对象的发昌机器厂，也发奋图强，全力以赴，造纸机的任务已经完成90％左右。
    帮助别人完成计划的工厂，看到兄弟厂为了保证全业完成计划，目前还在加油苦干，也进一步促进了自己的生产。许多工厂虽然抽调出一部分人力和设备支援了兄弟厂，但是在厂的工人都提出“人少活不少”的奋斗目标，继续大闹技术革新，挖掘生产潜力。大华玻璃仪器厂把十分之一的能力帮助热水瓶厂以后，工人们继续鼓足干劲，12月上旬的生产比支援前的11月上旬反而提高10％左右。
    还有许多受人帮助而完成计划的工厂，现在也反过来派人出去帮助另外一些没有完成计划的工厂了。金星金笔厂上半年因为原料供应关系，计划完成得比较差；最近原料供应正常，人力不够，有关部门从一些织袜厂给它调去了一批工人。11月中旬，金星厂自己完成计划以后，听到生产罐头的泰康食品厂因为水果原料大批涌到而来不及加工，马上抽出了六十多个工人前去帮助突击。
