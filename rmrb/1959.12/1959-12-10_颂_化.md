Ode to "化" (Transformation/ -ization)
    Tian Ma

    The word "化" (hua, transformation/ -ization) is excellent. We often read this word in newspapers, hear it in people's conversations, and in folk songs. When people talk about it, they feel happy and cheerful, rejoicing and singing aloud for some of the "化" that have already been realized; they put a lot of thought and effort into some of the "化" that are being planned.

    I once heard a clappertalk performance where the performer rattled off dozens of "化" in one breath, such as People's Commune-ization, Communal Dining Hall-ization, Water Conservancy-ization, Garden Plot-ization, Greening-ization, Agricultural Mechanization, and so on. These "化" represent a lofty aspiration of the people, some of which have been realized, and some of which are being worked hard towards. These "化" are large and small, and they revolve around a great goal—to realize socialist industrialization, agricultural modernization, and rapidly change the poor and blank state of our country.

    Whether it is a large "化" or a small "化," it is not so easy. For example, having only one or a few people's communes does not count as "化"; only when people's communes are established throughout the country can it be called People's Commune-ization. Therefore, this cannot be achieved with just a single order from above. "化" is closely linked to the mass movement; without the mass movement, there is no point in talking about "化."

    Let's take "Water Conservancy-ization" as an example. Why is the work of water conservancy construction so hot and successful? It is because overcoming natural disasters such as floods and droughts and ensuring a good harvest are the people's urgent demands and wishes. Therefore, at the call of the Party and the government, the masses immediately actively participated, setting off a massive movement to build water conservancy projects. They are truly invincible and all-conquering, and all difficulties and hardships are nothing in the face of heroes. It is not that difficulties frighten away heroes, but that heroes overcome difficulties. "Strength to uproot mountains, spirit to cover the world," this was Chu Bawang's self-description, but the people who truly possess the spirit of "uprooting mountains" are not Chu Bawang, but the broad masses of the people. Only they can truly make high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way. But the masses are not satisfied; they want to go to the next level and truly achieve the word "化." Preliminary water conservancy-ization is not enough; they must strive to achieve mechanized irrigation.

    Why is it that things that people dared not even think about in the old society for thousands of years can be done today? Why did the masses not exert such great power in those days as they do today? This is because today there is the wise leadership of the Party, and the Party's thought, like a bright lamp, illuminates the eyes of the masses. The Party, like an internal combustion engine, has ignited the infinite potential of the masses. The thinking of the masses has undergone tremendous changes. People dare to think and dare to act, dare to realize this "化" and that "化," and fight tirelessly for the great ideal!

    Right-leaning opportunists are most dissatisfied with this word "化." They shake their heads at this "化" and shout at that "化," insisting that we have "化" things up. The reason is that they are afraid of revolution and afraid of mass movements. Every "化" is a profound revolution, a vigorous mass movement, and the result of every "化" is that our socialist construction takes a big step forward, which is incompatible with their stubborn and unchangeable bourgeois ideological position. Therefore, they oppose it in every possible way, and especially attack the People's Commune-ization movement severely. The reason they oppose the People's Commune-ization movement is none other than the fact that People's Commune-ization completely eliminates the possibility of the countryside "化"-ing back to capitalism. That is why they are so heartbroken and wail like mourners!

    It turns out that they like another kind of "化"—capitalist-ization—and try their best to pull us back to the old road of capitalism. They certainly don't like People's Commune-ization, and they are not satisfied with Cooperativization either! What they yearn for is "everything devolved to the household"—to "化" our socialist countryside back to capitalism! Some time ago, didn't they stir up trouble, trying to use a gust of cold wind to "化" away our rural public dining halls?

    Two kinds of "化," two kinds of positions, with clear boundaries. Socialist "化" is a happy and bright road, a cause for the whole people, in which the masses actively participate and enthusiastically support, so the "化" is good and the results are remarkable. Capitalist "化" is synonymous with poverty, exploitation, and oppression. Although the advocates shout themselves hoarse, few listen. The people of the whole country are firmly taking the socialist road under the leadership of the Party, and they are unceremoniously dealing a head-on blow to these capitalist apologists! In fact, these people really should "化" themselves thoroughly—give up their bourgeois ideological positions and wholeheartedly "化" to the proletariat, which is what we often call "remolding one's bones."

### 颂“化”

    颂“化”
    天马
    一个“化”字好得很。这个字我们经常在报纸上读到它，在人们的谈论中，在民歌里听到它。人们在谈论它时，心情舒畅，喜气洋洋，大家为一些已经实现的“化”而欢欣鼓舞，放声歌唱；为一些正在计划实现的“化”而大费心思，全力以赴。
    曾经听过一段快板，表演者一口气就说了好几十个“化”，比如人民公社化，食堂化，水利化，园田化，绿化，农业机械化，等等。这些“化”，表现了人民群众的一种崇高的愿望，其中有的已经实现，有的正在努力实现之中。这些“化”有大有小，而又围绕着一个伟大的目标——实现社会主义工业化，农业现代化，迅速改掉我们国家一穷二白的面貌。
    不管大“化”也好，小“化”也好，并不是那么轻而易举的，例如，只有一个或少数人民公社不算“化”，全国农村都成立人民公社了，那才能叫人民公社化了。因此，这不是凭空一声号令就办得到的。“化”和群众运动紧密地联系在一起，没有群众运动，就根本谈不到什么“化”。
    且以“水利化”为例。为什么兴修水利的工作搞得那么热火朝天，取得那么大的成绩？那是因为战胜水旱自然灾害，保证丰收，是人们迫切的要求和愿望，因此，党和政府一声号召，群众立即积极参加，掀起了一个声势浩大的兴修水利的运动，真是战无不胜，攻无不克，一切艰难困苦在英雄好汉们的面前根本算不了什么，不是困难吓退了英雄，而是英雄战胜了困难。“力拔山兮气盖世”，这是当年楚霸王的自况，而真正具有“力拔山”的气概的人，却不是楚霸王，而是广大的人民群众，只有他们才真能叫高山低头，河水让路。但群众还不满足，还要更上一层楼，真正地做到一个“化”字。初步水利化了，还不满足，还要努力做到水利灌溉机械化。
    为什么在旧社会千百年来，连想也不敢想的事，今天能够做到？为什么在那个时候，人民群众没有发挥像今天这样大的威力？这是因为今天有党的英明的领导，党的思想像一盏明灯一样照亮了群众的眼睛，党像内燃机一样把群众无限的潜力发动了起来。群众的思想起了巨大的变化，人们敢想敢作，敢于去实现这样“化”，那样“化”，为伟大的理想奋战不懈！
    右倾机会主义分子最不满意这个“化”字，他们对这样“化”摇头，对那样“化”叫嚷，硬说我们“化”糟了。原因是他们害怕革命，害怕群众运动。每一件“化”都是一次深刻的革命，都是一次轰轰烈烈的群众运动，而每一“化”的结果，都使我们的社会主义建设前进一大步，而这，是和他们顽固不化的资产阶级思想立场格格不入的。因此他们百般反对，而尤其攻击得厉害的是对人民公社化运动。他们之所以反对人民公社化运动，不是别的，而是因为人民公社化，彻底消除了农村“化”回资本主义的可能性，因此他们才那样痛心疾首，如丧考妣地叫嚎！
    原来他们喜欢的是另外一种“化”——资本主义化，竭尽全力企图想把我们拉回资本主义的老路去。人民公社化他们固然不喜欢，合作化他们又何尝满意！他们所向往的是“一切下放到户”——把我们的社会主义的农村“化”回到资本主义去！前些时候，他们不就曾经兴风作浪，想用一阵阴风吹“化”掉我们农村的公共食堂吗？
    两种“化”，两种立场，界限鲜明。社会主义的“化”，是幸福光明的大道，是全民的事业，群众积极参加，热情支持，因而“化”得好，成绩卓著；资本主义的“化”，是穷困，受剥削和受压迫的代名词，提倡者虽声嘶力竭，而听者寥寥。全国人民都在党的领导下坚决走社会主义的大路，而对这些资本主义的辩护士们却不客气地予以迎头痛击！其实，这些人倒是真的应该彻底“化”一下——放弃资产阶级的思想立场，全身心地“化”到无产阶级这边来，这也就是我们经常所说的“脱胎换骨”。
