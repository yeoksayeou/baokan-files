Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th – Jiangsu Province is actively assisting in-service teachers to improve their political and professional levels to meet the needs of the rapid development of education. Among the full-time, part-time, and agricultural-spare-time education teachers in the province, more than 115,000 are currently participating in various forms of in-service training.

Teacher training institutions at all levels in the province have been gradually improved. Each prefecture, city, and county has either established teacher training institutions independently or attached them to normal schools. Some communes have also established amateur normal schools or tutoring centers. The Nantong Prefecture has established a complete set of specialized organizations for teachers' in-service training from the prefecture to the county and commune levels. The prefecture has established a correspondence department for higher normal schools (or teacher training schools) and higher normal school correspondence tutoring centers. Below the county level, large groups are generally established on the basis of people's communes, and learning groups are established by department based on ordinary middle schools as the core. Each level has dedicated personnel in charge to ensure the regular development of training activities. The professional team engaged in teachers' in-service training is gradually expanding. At present, there are more than 670 full-time teaching and administrative personnel responsible for teachers' in-service training in the province, an increase of nearly one-fold compared with last year. The Yancheng Prefecture Teacher Training College has just been established, and the prefectural party committee and administrative office have allocated 24 full-time teachers, most of whom have a higher normal school undergraduate graduation level or have many years of teaching experience. There are even more part-time tutoring teachers in various places.

Teachers' in-service training in various places is closely integrated with teaching practice, and the methods are diverse. According to the students' learning conditions and requirements, the Nanjing Teacher Training College provides both face-to-face teaching and correspondence courses, both systematic cultural training and lesson preparation research, both specialized lectures and experimental demonstrations and production internships, which are very popular among teachers. In the past six months, the tutoring teachers of the Chinese, mathematics, and geography departments of the Nantong Prefecture Correspondence Tutoring Station have gone to various counties three times for tutoring and have corrected homework for students two to three times. In various places, teachers' attendance rates are very high in in-service training, whether it is centralized face-to-face teaching or regular tutoring activities. Some old teachers with twenty or thirty years of experience also actively sign up to participate in learning.

Party committees and education departments in various places attach great importance to this work. The heads of propaganda departments and cultural bureaus of the Nantong Prefectural Party Committee, the Administrative Office, and various counties personally participate in listening to lectures and holding symposiums for students, which greatly encourages the students. The Wuxi Municipal Education Department arranges fixed half-day face-to-face teaching time for teachers participating in in-service training on a departmental rotation basis, and each school also arranges the course schedule of relevant teachers on a departmental rotation basis, so that the training school, the trainees, and the schools where the trainees work are all satisfied. Party committees at all levels allocate cadres to teacher training institutions and provide material support. More than 40 kinds of correspondence teaching materials for various subjects for teachers' in-service training in middle and primary schools throughout the province have been compiled and printed. In order to further strengthen the leadership of in-service training for middle and primary school teachers, the Provincial Department of Education recently convened a teacher training work conference to exchange the situations and experiences of various places.

    千方百计提高教师水平
    江苏帮助教师业余进修办法多种多样
    新华社南京30日电　江苏省各地积极帮助在职教师提高政治和业务水平，适应教育事业飞跃发展的需要。全省全日制、半日制和工农业余教育的教师中，目前已有十一万五千多人参加了各种形式的业余进修。
    全省各地教师进修机构已逐步健全。各专区、市、县都单独设立或在师范学校内附设教师进修机构，有的公社还设立了业余师范或辅导点。南通专区从专区到县和公社建立了一整套教师业余进修的专门组织，专区建立高师函授部
  （或者教师进修学校）和高师函授辅导点，县以下一般以人民公社为单位建立大组，以普通中学为核心按系科建立学习小组，层层都有专人负责，保证了进修活动的经常开展。担任教师业余进修工作的专业队伍正在逐步扩大。目前全省负责教师业余进修的专职教学人员和行政人员有六百七十多人，比去年增加将近一倍。盐城专区教师进修学院刚刚建立，地委和专署已配备了二十四名专职教师，其中多数是具有高师本科毕业水平或富有多年教学经验的教师。各地兼职的辅导教师为数更多。
    各地教师业余进修都密切结合教学实际进行，方法多种多样。南京市教师进修学院根据学员的学习条件和要求，既办面授、又办函授，既有系统的文化进修、又有备课研究，既有专科讲座、又有实验演示和生产实习，很受教师欢迎。南通专区函授辅导站中文、数学、地理三系的辅导教师，半年来分赴各县进行了三次辅导，为学员批改作业二至三次。各地教师在业余进修学习中，不论是集中面授，或是平时开展辅导活动，出席率都很高。有些二、三十年的老教师，也主动报名参加学习。
  各地党委和教育部门对这一工作十分重视。南通地委、专署和各县的宣传部长、文化局长，都亲自参加听课和召开学员座谈会，学员受到很大鼓舞。无锡市教育部门为参加业余进修的教师，分科轮流安排每周固定半天的面授时间，各校也分科轮流统一安排有关教师的课务，做到进修学校、进修学员和学员任职的学校三方面都满意。各级党委为教师进修机构调派干部，在物质上给予支持。全省专供中、小学教师业余进修用的各科函授教材，就编印了四十余种。省教育厅为了进一步加强在职中、小学教师业余进修工作的领导，最近召开了教师进修工作会议，交流了各地的情况和经验。（附图片）
