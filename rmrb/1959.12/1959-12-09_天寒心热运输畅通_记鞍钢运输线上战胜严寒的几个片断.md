    Cold Weather, Warm Hearts, Smooth Transportation
    ——A Record of Overcoming Severe Cold on the Angang Transportation Line
    By Our Correspondents Gu Tie Feng and Wang Dian Xue
    From November 23rd, the wind and snow didn't stop, and in just two days and one night, the ground was covered with a foot of snow. The severe cold came suddenly and early. The heavy snow transformed Anshan into a silver world. The severe cold is testing the employees of Angang's transportation department.
    Wind and Snow Cannot Stop the Leap Forward
    Angang's Lingshan Station is the gateway to and from Angang. Every day, thousands of trainloads of fuel and raw materials from all over the country must pass through this station to be distributed to Angang's various factories and mines. Thousands of trainloads of high-quality steel and many other products supplied by Angang to the whole country must also be transported to various places through this station. The severe cold is first testing the employees of Lingshan Station.
    Duty Director Wang Yujiu stood in the wind and snow on the hump of the hump marshalling yard. He cupped his hands and stamped his feet, looking around. He saw a vast expanse of white snow, and the north wind brought biting cold. Looking down at his feet, there was a dark mass of freight cars waiting to be assembled and sent to various factories. So many cars made him feel a little breathless. With the arrival of heavy snow and severe cold, cars with frozen axles slid slower, and people's hands and feet were not as agile. The efficiency of marshalling was decreasing, having already dropped from the original eighteen trains per shift to twelve. Twenty years of marshalling experience told him that if this continued, the station would be blocked.
    Wang Yujiu thought to himself: This situation must be changed. He watched several freight cars slide down the hump, seemingly slower than before, and then saw that they slid even slower after passing through the retarder. He thought that when the weather gets cold, the oil in the axle box would solidify, and the freight car would slide slower, and after friction in the retarder, wouldn't the sliding be even slower…? He immediately directed the operator to shorten the friction time of the retarder. Sure enough, this measure was very effective, and one shift quickly assembled fourteen trains.
    The next day, as soon as he started work, he grabbed the phone and contacted the railway department. When he learned that if their shift could not assemble twenty trains, six trains would be blocked on the railway trunk line, resulting in hundreds of trainloads of fuel and raw materials not being able to be transported in, he put down the phone and immediately called a meeting of the entire shift. At the meeting, he said in a decisive tone: We must resolutely assemble twenty trains to ensure that not a single trainload of coking coal or ore is unable to be transported in. As soon as the meeting was dismissed, the entire shift started working. As for him, wherever there was a problem, he appeared there. The exemplary actions of this Communist Party member inspired the labor enthusiasm of the entire shift. Brakeman Li Daxiang ran back and forth on the one-kilometer-long marshalling line, following the cars wherever they went, so hot that he took off his cotton coat and worked in only a shirt. As a result, this shift really assembled twenty trains, setting a new record. The entire staff of Lingshan Station shouted the slogan of learning from Wang Yujiu and surpassing Wang Yujiu. Encouraged by this slogan, the station ensured that Angang's gateway was unobstructed.
    Worker-Peasant Competition to Skillfully Unload Frozen Coal
    In the coal storage yard of the Chemical Complex, trains of frozen coal cars were parked. This was washed coal powder for coking coal transported from the Hegang and Shuangyashan coal mines. The weather was too cold, and the surface of the coal powder was frozen into a hard shell more than a foot thick. When the giant coal grabber grabbed this frozen coal, its steel claws only left streaks. However, the difficulties that frightened the large coal grabber could not frighten the loading and unloading workers. Loading and unloading pacesetter Xu Zhongqi's team took the lead in launching a decisive battle with the frozen coal cars. They took off their cotton coats, wielded large picks, and eight people stubbornly and fiercely chipped away, unloading two cars of frozen coal in eight hours. The frozen coal was unloaded, but the time was extended. In the past, it only took forty minutes to unload a car of coal, but now the unloading time was extended fivefold. As soon as he got off work, Zhang Yonglai anxiously said to Xu Zhongqi: This way of working is not good. If we unload so slowly, won't the blast furnace have to stare at the coal mountain without fuel? Xu Zhongqi was also anxious. He knew that being anxious was useless. So they held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" overnight, asking everyone to come up with ideas. Everyone chimed in, putting together a "digging the heart to unload coal" method, which was to first pry open the car door, dig holes from both sides inward, take out the coal in the middle that was not frozen, hollow out the middle, and then use a large pick to chip away at the three sides, so that the hard cover could be quickly lifted. This was really a good method. After starting work, they only used one hour and forty minutes to unload a car of frozen coal.
    Next to Xu Zhongqi's team were thirteen young farmers, members of the Qianshan People's Commune, who had come specifically to support Angang's loading and unloading. These young men were not willing to show weakness. At an experience exchange meeting, they even challenged Xu Zhongqi's team. The next day, as soon as work started, the two teams started competing. Both used the "digging the heart" method to work. In the beginning, the speed of the two teams was about the same. When it came to unloading the frozen coal at the bottom of the car, the commune members, based on their experience in rural areas of chipping frozen manure, came up with a clever method: first use a sledgehammer to knock the frozen coal to make it crisp, then use a large pick to chip it backwards. As a result, they finished unloading a car of frozen coal in one hour and thirty minutes, ten minutes ahead of Xu Zhongqi's team, breaking the record set by Xu Zhongqi's team.
    Haul More and Run Faster to Transport Ore
    In the ore storage trough of the Sintering Plant, the reserves of concentrate powder were gradually decreasing. It was also because of the cold weather that the surface of the steel rails was very slippery, and the wheels tended to spin. The traction capacity of the locomotive was reduced, and the original one locomotive pulling twenty-two cars of ore suddenly decreased by half. The existing two electric locomotives could not complete the transportation task. At this time, the Locomotive Depot decided to transfer electric locomotive number zero-four-zero to support. Wang Zohou, the driver of zero-four-zero, was an experienced driver with nine years of experience. The chief of the Locomotive Depot specifically said to him: You are an old driver, with rich driving experience, and you are familiar with the conditions of this line. You also know that transportation is very tight… Before he could finish speaking, Wang Zohou interrupted and said: Don't worry, chief! Don't look at the cold weather and slippery roads, I guarantee to pull more than in the summer. I want to perform pulling thirty… Before he could finish speaking, he looked at the chief. The chief encouraged him and said: As long as you dare to think and dare to do, prepare in advance, you will definitely be able to pull thirty. Before going to the Yanshan Mine, he filled the anti-skid sand and carefully checked the sand-spreading pipeline before speeding off to the Yanshan Mine.
    The dispatcher at the Yanshan Station, after hearing that Wang Zohou wanted to perform the technique of hauling more, prepared a train consisting of twenty-two cars in advance. When Wang Zohou arrived at the station and saw that there were only twenty-two cars of ore, he told the dispatcher: Please add eight more cars. This scared the dispatcher. The dispatcher quickly stopped him and said: It's colder today than the previous two days. I think two locomotives are enough to pull them. If the car breaks down halfway, this is not a joke. Wang Zohou said with certainty: The chief has agreed. The dispatcher couldn't persuade him, so he had to add eight more cars.
    The train set off. From Yanshan to the Sintering Plant, it was necessary to climb two large slopes of more than ten thousandths. The first large slope was a bottomless pit shape, going down this slope and up that slope. When going downhill, the speed should have been reduced. This time, he not only did not slow down, but gradually increased the speed. He kept his hand on the brake handle, ready to brake at any time, stared at the line, honked the horn continuously, and used the force of the downhill speeding to rush up the opposite large slope in one breath. At this time, he breathed a sigh of relief. When climbing the second large slope, he started spreading sand far away from the uphill, and then skillfully sprinkled anti-skid sand when the speed began to decrease when he climbed halfway. As a result, he smoothly climbed over the second large slope. The train entered the terminal station on time, setting a new record for hauling thirty cars of ore. Under the leadership of Wang Zohou, almost every locomotive on this line is now pulling twenty-five cars every trip, exceeding the summer traction quota. As a result of the locomotives hauling more and running faster, the concentrate powder in the ore storage trough of the Sintering Plant is increasing day by day.
    In this way, under the strong leadership of the Party committee and with the strong support of the people of the city, the employees of Angang's transportation department used their energy and wisdom to melt snow, thaw ice, and overcome the severe cold, ensuring smooth internal and external transportation for Angang.

    In order to quickly overcome the railway congestion caused by strong winds and heavy snow, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized members of three districts, five people's communes, and seventeen factories and mines to carry out mass unloading activities. This is them rushing to unload coal at the railway loading and unloading yard.

    天寒心热运输畅通
    ——记鞍钢运输线上战胜严寒的几个片断
    本报记者　顾铁风　王殿学
    从11月23日起，风雪不停，两天一夜平地积雪尺许，严寒突然提早袭来了。大雪把鞍山变成一个银装的世界。严寒在考验着鞍钢运输部门的职工。
    风雪难阻跃进路
    鞍钢的灵山车站，是鞍钢进出的咽喉；每天从全国各地运来的几千车燃料和原料，都要经过这个车站分发给鞍钢各厂矿；鞍钢供应全国的成千车优质钢材等许多产品，也要经过这个车站运往各地。严寒首先考验着灵山车站的职工们。
    值班主任王玉久，冒着风雪，站在驼峰调车场的驼峰上。他拱着手跺着脚，向四下眺望，只见白茫茫一片大雪，北风吹来寒风刺骨；再看看脚下，却是黑鸦鸦一片货车，在等待着编组发往各厂；这么多车压得他有些喘不过气来了。随着大雪和严寒的到来，凝轴车滑行得慢，人的手脚也不灵活，调车的效率在下降，已经从原来每班编组十八列降低到十二列了。二十来年的调车经验告诉他，再这样继续下去，车站就要堵塞了。
    王玉久心里叨念着：一定得改变这种局面。他看着几辆货车从驼峰上滑下去，比以前好像慢一些，再一看通过缓行器之后，滑行得就更慢了。他想到天气一冷，车轴箱里的油要凝结，货车滑行得就慢，再经过缓行器一摩擦，滑行得不就更……他马上指挥操纵手，缩短缓行器摩擦时间。果然，这个措施很有效，一个班编组很快就达到十四个列车。
    第二天一上班，他抓起电话就和铁路部门联系。当他知道在他们班上如果编不出二十个列车来的话，就会有六个列车堵在铁路干线上，结果使几百车燃料和原料运不进来。他放下电话机子，立即召集全班开会，会上，他以斩钉截铁的口气说：坚决编组二十个列车，保证不让一车炼焦煤或矿石运不进来。会一散，全班工人就干开了；他本人哩，哪里有问题，他就出现在哪里。这位共产党员的模范行动，激发了全班工人的劳动热情；制动员李大祥，在一千米长的调车线上，来回地奔跑，车到哪里他跟到哪里，热得他脱去棉袄，只穿一件秋衣干活。结果这一班真的就编组完二十个列车，创造了新纪录。灵山全站职工喊出了学习王玉久，超过王玉久的口号。在这个口号的鼓舞下，保证了鞍钢的这个咽喉畅通无阻。
    工农比武巧卸冻煤
    在化工总厂的贮煤场上，停着一列列冻结煤车。这是从鹤岗煤矿和双鸭山煤矿运来的炼焦煤洗粉。天气太冷了，煤粉表面冻成了一尺多厚的硬壳，巨人般的抓煤机，抓在这种冻煤上，钢爪只留下一条条爪痕。可是，困难吓住了大抓煤机，却吓不住装卸工人们。装卸标兵徐忠强班带头和冻煤车展开决战。他们脱去棉衣，抡起大镐，八个人硬碰硬的猛刨，八小时卸完了两车冻煤。冻煤是卸下来了，可是时间却延长了。过去卸一车煤，只要四十分钟，现在卸车时间延长了五倍。刚下班，张永来就着急地对徐忠强说：这样干法可不行，咱们卸的这么慢，那不是要让高炉望着煤山没柴烧么？徐忠强也在着急，他知道，急是没有用的；于是他们连夜开了个诸葛亮会，请大家出主意。大家你一言他一语，凑成一个“掏心卸煤”的办法，就是先把车门撬开，从两边往里掏洞，把中间没冻的煤掏出来，把中间掏空，这时再用大镐刨三面，这样很快就可以把硬盖揭开。这真是个好办法，上班以后，他们只用了一点四十分钟，就卸完了一车冻煤。
    紧挨着徐忠强班，是十三个青年农民，他们是千山人民公社的社员，是特意前来支援鞍钢装卸的。这些小伙子，个个都不示弱。在一次经验交流会上，竟向徐忠强班挑起战来。第二天一开工，两个班就赛起来了。都是用“掏心”的办法干，开始，两个班的快慢还差不多，等到卸车底上的冻煤时，社员们根据在农村刨冻粪的经验，想出一个巧办法来，先用大锤敲，把冻煤震酥，再倒退着用大镐刨，结果比徐忠强班提前十分钟，用一点三十分钟卸完一车冻煤，刷新了徐忠强班创造的纪录。
    多拉快跑赶运矿石
    在烧结总厂的储矿槽里，精矿粉的储量在逐渐减少。也是因为天冷，钢轨表面很滑，车轮跑起来好打空转，机车牵引能力降低了，原来一台拉二十二车矿石，突然减少了一半。原有的两台电机车完不成运输任务了。就在这个时候，机务段决定调零四零号电机车去支援。零四零司机长王佐厚，是一位有九年工龄的老司机。机务段长特意对他说：你是个老司机，驾驶经验很丰富，又熟悉这条线路情况；你也知道运输很紧张……往下的话还没有说完，王佐厚就抢着说：段长你放心！别看天冷路滑，保证拉的比夏季还多，我想表演拉三十个……话没说完，先看看段长。段长鼓励他说：只要你敢想敢干，事先做好准备，一定能拉三十个。在去眼前山矿之前，他把防滑砂子装满，又细心地检查了一遍溜砂子的管线，这才飞快地向眼前山矿驶去。
    眼前山车站的调度员，听说王佐厚要表演多拉的技术，事先给他准备好由二十二个车辆组成的列车。王佐厚到站一看，只有二十二车矿石，就告诉调度员说：你再给挂八个车。这下子可把调度员给吓住了。调度员赶快拦住说：今天比头两天还冷，我看两台机车都够拉的了，要是车子抛锚在半路上，这可不是闹着玩的。王佐厚满有把握地说：段长都同意了。调度员扭不过他，只好又给挂上八个车。
    车子出发了。从眼前山到烧结总厂，要爬两个千分之十以上的大坡。头一个大坡，是个锅底坑形，下这个坡上那个坡。在下坡时，本来应该减低速度；这一回，他不但没有减速，反而逐渐加大。他手不离闸把，准备随时刹车，眼睛死盯着线路，连续不断地鸣笛，利用下坡快跑的堕力，一口气冲上对面的大坡，这时他才松了一口气。在爬第二个大坡时，在离上坡很远的地方，他就开始撒砂子，随手把电流给到最大限度，等到爬到半道速度开始降低时，他又熟练地洒防滑砂子。结果很顺利地爬过第二道大坡。列车正点开进终点站，创造了一次牵引三十车矿石的新纪录。在王佐厚的带动下，现在这条线路上，几乎是每台机车，都趟趟拉二十五个车，超过夏季的牵引定额。由于机车多拉快跑的结果，烧结总厂储矿槽里的精矿粉在日日增多。
    就是这样，鞍钢运输部门的职工，在党委的坚强领导下，在全市人民的大力支援下，用他们的干劲和智慧，融雪解冻战胜了严寒，保证鞍钢内外运输畅通无阻。（附图片）
    中共鞍山市委为了迅速克服由于大风大雪所造成的铁路线堵塞现象，组织了三个区、五个人民公社，十七个厂矿的社员群众和职工，大搞群众性的卸车活动。这是他们正在铁路装卸场突击卸煤。
