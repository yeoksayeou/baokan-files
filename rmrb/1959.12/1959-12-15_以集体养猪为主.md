    Primarily Relying on Collective Pig Raising

To primarily rely on collective raising or private raising? This is a divergence of two ideologies and two paths in the pig-raising enterprise. We unswervingly adhere to the policy of primarily relying on collective raising and secondarily relying on private raising.

Why should we primarily rely on collective raising? Collective pig raising can achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Specifically, it can better implement pig-raising methods that prioritize manure accumulation, rely mainly on roughage, and prioritize self-breeding, which is of great significance for promoting agricultural production and alleviating the current contradiction of insufficient feed and pig supply. Collective pig raising is also conducive to technological innovation and scientific feeding management, to achieve the goal of less effort and greater results. The fact that Gushi County suburban commune in Henan province has greatly developed pig raising fully proves this conclusion.

Due to the "large-scale and public" nature of the people's communes, extremely favorable conditions have been created for establishing a large number of pig farms, feed bases, and unified allocation of manpower and materials. This shows that collective pig raising is not only very necessary but also entirely possible.

### 以集体养猪为主

    以集体养猪为主
    以集体饲养为主，还是以私养为主？这是养猪事业中两种思想、两条道路的分歧。我们则坚定不移地坚持以集体饲养为主、私养为辅的方针。
    为什么要以集体饲养为主？集体养猪可以收到多快好省之效。具体地讲，可以更好地贯彻执行以积肥为主、以粗饲料为主、自繁自养为主的养猪办法，这对促进农业生产、缓和当前饲料和猪源不足的矛盾有着重大的意义；集体养猪，还有利于革新技术、进行科学地饲养管理，以达到花力小、收效大的目的。河南固始县城郊公社养猪大发展的事实，充分地证明了这个结论。
    由于人民公社“一大二公”，为大量兴办养猪场、饲料基地、统一调配人力物力等，创造了极为有利的条件。这说明集体养猪不仅是十分必要，而且也是完全可能的。
