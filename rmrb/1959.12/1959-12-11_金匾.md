Golden Plaque
    Zhou Minzhen, Mao Zhengshan

    We passed through a small border village. The village was filled with the sounds of gongs and drums, the crackling of firecrackers, and children running around, shouting:
    "Look at the golden plaque!"
    "The golden plaque is being hung!"

    Amidst the rising smoke, the cheers, applause, and music, a large, elaborately carved and sculpted golden plaque, glittering brightly, was hung above the doorway of a large, flat-roofed house. The plaque was engraved with four large characters: "Beijing Cafeteria," shining in the sunlight.

    We were just about to ask what was going on when people grabbed us and ushered us into the cafeteria. Border people are always as warm as fire to comrades from the interior.

    The cafeteria was so neatly and cleanly arranged! In the spacious and bright room, there were rows of tidy low dining tables and bamboo stools. Each table had a gauze fly cover, and the bowls, chopsticks, and cutlery were neatly arranged in the cabinets, each compartment labeled with the name of a household. In the center of the cafeteria was a color portrait of Chairman Mao, flanked by a pair of red couplets: "The benefits of the commune are endless, when drinking water, don't forget the well-digger."

    "It's wonderful! It's truly a standard Beijing Cafeteria!" We couldn't help but sincerely praise the production team leader who was showing us around.

    At this moment, an old cook brought over a tray of corn porridge, pickled vegetables, chili sauce, and so on, insisting that we eat some lunch. We said we had just eaten at the brigade headquarters, but the old man said in a loud, hearty voice, "The brigade headquarters is half a day's journey from here, the food you ate is long gone to fertilizer!"

    The production team leader introduced the old man to us, saying, "This is our new cafeteria director, everyone calls him Grandpa Cook..."
    "I'm called Liao the Old Blind!"

    We then noticed that there was indeed a layer of gray mist in the old man's eyes. Although he still had some vision, it took some effort for him to see things.

    "Is today the celebration of the cafeteria's founding, since you're hanging the golden plaque?" we asked.
    "No... um..." The normally cheerful old man suddenly became tongue-tied. The team leader quickly smiled and said, "If you want to know the story behind this golden plaque, it's all about our Grandpa Cook. Why don't you talk to him!"

    The old man used to be a carpenter, but he stopped doing that after his eyes became clouded. In recent years, he had grown old and weak, so he watched over the fields for the commune, took care of his grandchildren at home, and tended to his private plot. His family of several managed to get by.

    Last year, his son became seriously ill. Thanks to the commune's help, he was sent to the county People's Hospital for free treatment. He stayed there for months, and his daughter-in-law earned few work points. She left behind four children, owed the commune a sum of money, and life was becoming difficult. Thanks to the commune's assistance, they managed to get through the lean months of May and June. But because they earned few work points, the grain distributed during the summer harvest was almost gone by September…

    Just then, the people's commune rose like the sun, its warm and bright light shining on the old man's heart. The old man's family no longer worried about food, and the children were also sent to the nursery. How grateful the old man was! He couldn't stay idle at home, so he volunteered to work as a cook in the public cafeteria. The children called him "Grandpa Cook" because he was old.

    Grandpa Cook did everything and managed everything in the cafeteria. His carpentry skills came in handy again. He used scrap wood to make many low tables and repaired doors and windows. He also washed dishes, chopped firewood, served food, delivered meals to the fields, and did everything. People said: Grandpa Cook is going to become a model worker! At the beginning of this spring, Grandpa Cook went up the mountain and cut down a cedar tree that he had reserved for his coffin and carried it home to saw it into several thick planks. Others couldn't figure out his intentions. The old men of his generation jokingly asked, "Brother Liao, why are you making a 'house' (coffin)? Don't you want to live anymore?"

    "Don't want to live? I still want to see communism! This good society, I don't want to die!"

    It turned out that he was making a golden plaque. In his words, "In the past, when scholars and jinshi became officials, they would hang a plaque to glorify their ancestors, bah! They didn't deserve to hang any plaques. Now, the Communist Party is worthy of ten thousand thanks and deserves to have a plaque hung. A plaque should be hung solemnly in front of the cafeteria, to be passed down through the ages, so that future generations will never forget the benefits of the commune!"

    From then on, after finishing his work as a cook every day, he devoted himself to making the plaque. Every night, wearing his reading glasses, he carved dragons and phoenixes, painted flowers and brocade on the plaque, with great care. He also asked the school teacher to write the four characters "Beijing Cafeteria" to be engraved in the center of the plaque. The old man had his reasons for choosing this name. He said, "We must always remember Beijing and Chairman Mao! This is remembering where the water comes from!"

    Before the golden plaque was completed, a small gust of ill wind blew in. Someone in the village said: Joining the public cafeteria should be voluntary, and those who don't want to can withdraw. Under his instigation, half of the village withdrew, and the remaining half was also uneasy.

    The old man was in turmoil. At night, he was alone in front of the unfinished golden plaque. Seeing the saddle, he thought of the horse, and the sight stirred his emotions, and he couldn't help but burst into tears.

    The next day at dawn, he ran to the brigade headquarters, grabbed the Party secretary's hand and asked, "Party Secretary, what is the policy on running the cafeteria?"

    The Party Secretary said: "Run it well and encourage voluntary participation. We should actively run the cafeteria well and strive for mass participation."

    The old man's heart suddenly opened up. He ran back excitedly, didn't eat, and suggested holding a cafeteria meeting to discuss how to actively run it well and attract the people who had withdrawn back to the cafeteria. After some discussion, they came up with a long list of improvements.

    After the meeting, the old man acted as a voluntary propagandist, constantly spreading the word. The old man also rolled up his bedding and simply moved to sleep next to the kitchen stove, guarding the cafeteria like it was his child, constantly seeking the opinions of the masses and trying every possible means to improve the work. In the evening, he still kept working on his golden plaque tirelessly, not discouraged, always keeping in mind the words of the Party Secretary: "Run it well!"

    Sure enough, in less than three months, the cafeteria was brand new, just like what we see now, truly a "Beijing Cafeteria." The vegetables grown by the cafeteria also began to be harvested. People ate well, ate economically, and there were many additional benefits! For example, tea supply, hot water for bathing, adding meat and vegetables on market days and festivals. As a result, the families that had withdrawn gradually asked to return to the cafeteria.

    As of today, even the last old middle peasant family voluntarily requested to return to the cafeteria. It happened that Grandpa Cook's golden plaque was also completed. People happily hung the golden plaque on the cafeteria door to celebrate this cafeteria that would never be broken up. (Picture attached)

    金匾
    周民震　毛正三
    我们路过一个小边寨，寨子里锣鼓声喧闹着，爆竹噼噼啪啪地响着，孩子们欢蹦乱跳地穿来跑去，边跑边喊着：
    “看金匾”！
    “挂金匾啦！”
    在硝烟腾腾中，在人们的欢声、掌声和鼓乐声中，一块大幅的雕龙塑凤的金匾，金光灿灿地挂上一座大平房的门楣上，金匾上面镌刻着四个斗大的字：“北京食堂”，在阳光下闪闪发光。
    我们正想问问事情的原委，人们却早把我们连拉带拥地请进了食堂。边疆人对来自内地的同志向来是热得像火一般。
    这食堂的摆设真爽利干净啊！宽敞亮堂的屋里，排列着整齐的矮饭桌、竹凳子，每张桌上都有一个纱布作的蝇罩，碗筷餐具都有条不紊地摆在橱柜里，柜里分格地标明各家各户的牌号。食堂正中是一幅毛主席的彩色画像，像的两边镶着一副红对联：“公社好处无穷尽，饮水不忘挖井人。”
    “真好啊！真是标准的北京食堂！”对着带我们参观的生产队长，我们止不住由衷地夸赞起来。
    这时，一个老炊事员端来了一托盘玉米稀饭和咸菜辣酱等等，硬要我们吃些晌午饭。我们说刚在大队部吃过了，老人大着嗓门爽快地说：“大队部到这足有半天路程，吃的饭早变成肥料了哩！”
    生产队长把老人介绍给我们说：“这就是我们食堂的新主任，大家都管他叫炊事爷爷……”
    “我叫廖老瞎哩！”
    我们这才注意，老人的眼睛里确有一层灰雾般的东西，虽然还有视力，但看东西却费些力。
    “今天挂金匾，是食堂成立的喜庆日子吗？”我们问。
    “不……嗯……”爽快的老人一时变得口吃起来。队长连忙笑着说：“要问起这块金匾的故事，就正出在我们炊事爷爷身上啦，你们跟他谈谈嘛！”
    老人原来是个木匠，自从两眼起了灰雾就不再干这行了；近几年来，年迈力衰，给社里看看田水，在家里带带孙子，搞点自留地，一家几口生活倒也过得去。
    去年他儿子生了场大病，多亏社里的帮助，送进了县人民医院免费治疗。一住几个月未回，媳妇挣的工分为数不多，丢下四个孩子，欠了社里一笔款，生活眼看着有些紧迫起来。由于社里的接济，才度过了青黄不接的五、六月。可是挣的工分少，夏收分配的粮食，没吃到九月就又快完了……
    正在这时，人民公社像太阳般升了起来，温暖明亮的光芒，抚照在老人的心上。老人一家人再也不愁吃饭了，孩子也进了托儿所。老人多么感谢啊，他在家里闲不住，便自动去公共食堂当了一名炊事员。孩子们见他老，就管他叫“炊事爷爷。”
    炊事爷爷在食堂里什么都干，什么都管。他的木匠本领又使用上了，利用废木料做了许多矮桌子，修理门窗。其他洗碗劈柴，端菜分菜，下地送饭，样样都做，人们都说：炊事爷爷要争老模范啦！今年春头，炊事爷爷上山把自己留作寿木的一株杉树砍了下来，扛回家里锯成几块厚厚的板子。别人都摸不透他的打算。同辈的老人们打趣地问道：“廖瞎哥，你怎么就做‘房子’（棺材）啦？不想活啦？”
    “不想活？我还要看共产主义呢！现今这好社会，不想死啦！”
    原来他在做一块金匾。按照他的话说：“早先举人进士当了官，要光宗耀祖，兴挂个匾，呸！那哪里配挂什么匾呢，如今共产党千恩万德，才值得挂个匾嘛。要做块匾堂堂正正地挂在食堂门前，流芳百世，让子孙万代忘不了公社的好处！”
    从此，他每天干完炊事员的工作后，就全埋进做匾上了。每晚戴着老花镜子在匾上雕龙剔凤，描花画锦，可精细啦。他还请学校的老师写了“北京食堂”四个大字，准备刻在匾的中央。老人取这个名字，也是有它的来由的，他说：“要时刻念到北京，念到毛主席啊！这就是饮水思源啦！”
    金匾还没有完工，忽然刮来了一小股歪风，寨子里有个人说：办公共食堂要讲自愿，不自愿的可以退出。在他的煽动下，全寨退出了半数人家，剩下的一半情绪也不安。
    老人心乱如麻。晚上，他独自一人对着这块尚未完工的金匾，真是见鞍思马，触景生情，不禁涕泪横流。
    第二天朦朦亮，他就跑到大队部，抓住党支书的手就问：“党支书，办食堂的政策是怎么的？”
    党支书说：“积极办好，自愿参加。我们应该积极办好食堂，争取群众都来参加才对！”
    老人心里豁然开朗，兴冲冲地跑回来，饭没吃就建议召开食堂会议，研究怎么才能积极办好，争取退出的群众都回到食堂来。大家一商议，提出了一大串改进办法。
    会后，老人充当了义务宣传员，不停地宣传开了。老人又回家把铺盖一卷，索性搬到食堂火灶旁边睡去了，一天到晚像守着孩子似的护着食堂，时时征求群众意见，千方百计地改进工作。一到晚间，还是不停手地刻着他那块金匾。毫不灰心，心里时刻想着党支书的话：“积极办好！”
    果然，没过三个月，食堂面目一新啦，就像我们现在看到的，真是个“北京食堂”了，食堂种的菜也开始收获了。人们吃得好，又吃得省，还有许多额外的福利呢！比如茶水供应啦，热水洗澡啦，墟日（赶集日）过节加肉加菜啦，这一来，退出去的人家都陆陆续续又要求回到食堂里来了。
    到今天为止，连最后一家老中农，也自愿要求回到食堂了，恰好炊事爷爷的金匾也全部完工啦，人们都欢天喜地地把金匾挂到食堂门口，来庆贺这个雷打不散的食堂。（附图片）
