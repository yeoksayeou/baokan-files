Bahrain National Liberation Front Issues Statement
Imperialists Get Out of Bahrain

Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: TASS, Baghdad, December 16th: "People's Solidarity" published a statement by the Bahrain National Liberation Front, calling on the residents of the archipelago to unite around the National Liberation Front to fight for the liberation of their homeland from foreign rule.

The statement firmly protested the actions of the British colonialists, who plundered the oil, the property of the people of Bahrain, thereby plunging the residents of this small Arab country, still under British protection, into poverty and powerlessness. The statement said, "We openly demand of the imperialists: Get out of our country. We do not like your protection, because this protection benefits the enemies of our people."

Bahrain Emirate
The Bahrain Islands are an emirate in the Persian Gulf region under British "protection". In 1820, British colonialists forced the Emir of Bahrain to sign an unequal treaty, seizing the island. According to the agreement, the areas controlled by the Emir could not have any relations with other countries without the consent of the United Kingdom, and all power was controlled by the British "political representatives" and "advisors."

On the 551 square kilometers of Bahrain, with a population of more than 143,000 (mostly Arabs), the world's famous oil is abundant, with estimated reserves of about 40 million tons. The 1958 output was about 2 million tons. However, the right to exploit Bahrain's oil is entirely in the hands of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, jointly owned by Mobil Oil and Texaco.

The people of Bahrain have been fighting for independence. In December 1954, a large-scale strike broke out. In 1956, demonstrations by the people of Manama, the capital of the Emirate of Bahrain, forced the British "Advisor" Belgrave to announce his "retirement." Since the Suez incident, with the rise of the national liberation struggle in the Middle East, the struggle of the people of Bahrain for independence has been strengthened. (Mao)

    从太平洋到印度洋　从地中海到波斯湾
    岛国处处迸发争取独立自由的火焰
    巴林群岛民族解放阵线发表声明
    帝国主义从巴林滚出去
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社巴格达16日讯：“人民团结报”刊载了巴林群岛民族解放阵线的声明，声明号召这个群岛的居民团结在民族解放阵线的周围为争取祖国摆脱外国的统治而斗争。
    声明坚决地抗议英国殖民主义者的行为，他们掠夺巴林群岛人民的财产石油，因而使这个至今仍处在英国保护下的阿拉伯小国的居民陷入贫困和无权的境地。声明说，“我们公开地要求帝国主义者：从我们国家滚出去。我们不喜欢你们的保护，因为这种保护有利于我们人民敌人。”
    巴林酋长国
    巴林群岛是受英国“保护”的波斯湾地区的一个酋长国。1820年，英殖民者强迫巴林的酋长签订不平等协定，侵占了该岛。根据协定，酋长所控制的地区在没有得到英国同意之前，不得与其他国家发生任何关系，一切大权都由英国的“政治代表”和“顾问”所控制。
    在五百五十一平方公里、十四万三千多人口（大部分是阿拉伯人）的巴林群岛上，盛产世界著名的石油，估计石油的蕴藏量约四千万吨，1958年开采量约二百万吨。但是，巴林石油的开采权却完全掌握在美孚油公司和德士古石油公司合股组成的巴林公司手中。
    巴林人民一直在为争取独立而斗争。1954年12月间爆发了大规模的罢工，1956年巴林酋长国首都曼纳马的人民的示威，迫使英国“顾问”贝尔格雷夫宣布“退休”。自苏伊士事件以来，在中东阿拉伯民族解放斗争高涨中，巴林群岛人民争取独立的斗争更为加强了。（茂）
