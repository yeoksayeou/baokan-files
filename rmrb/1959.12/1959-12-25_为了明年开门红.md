　　As 1960 rapidly approaches, local newspapers, while vigorously promoting the comprehensive and early completion of this year's plan, are also focusing their attention on striving for a flying start next year. Since mid-December, local newspapers have gradually strengthened their publicity in this regard.

　　Many newspapers have published editorials on this issue, elucidating the great significance of preparing for production in the first quarter of next year. Heilongjiang Daily, Shenyang Daily, and others have all pointed out that industrial production is continuous; today's production does not start today, but from yesterday, the day before yesterday. Grasping current production while preparing for the future is an objective law of industrial production. If next year's production is to continue to leap forward and rise step by step, it is even more necessary to prepare for next year this year, so that next year starts with a flying start, thereby laying a good foundation for the year's leap forward. Therefore, completing this year's production plan and preparing for production in the first quarter of next year are two complementary and mutually promoting tasks.

　　When discussing the content of next year's production preparation work, local newspapers unanimously emphasized that ideological preparation must be done first. The Tianjin Daily editorial stated that continuous leaps forward in production require continuous revolutions in thought. Among all production preparations, the most important is to make ideological preparations. New Hunan Daily pointed out that all preparations must be done by people, and can only be done well by people giving full play to their maximum subjective initiative. Therefore, the primary key lies in doing a good job in people's ideological work, continuing to thoroughly criticize right-leaning tendencies, and boosting morale. Shenyang Daily specifically criticized various right-leaning conservative thoughts and fears of difficulty that affect the production preparation work for the first quarter of next year, believing that in this work, as in other work, there is a struggle between two ideologies and two methods. Jiangxi Daily, on the one hand, opposed the complacency of units that had done a relatively good job in preparation, and on the other hand, opposed the negative waiting attitude of units that had done a relatively poor job, urging them to cheer up immediately and quickly catch up.

　　Local newspapers also discussed organizational preparations and material and technical preparations. New Hunan Daily pointed out that in order to achieve a flying start next year, it is necessary to resolutely change the old practice of "slack in the beginning and tight at the end," organize balanced production, and achieve a combination of work and rest. This requires organizing the masses to summarize the advanced experience in this year's production, especially the experience of production rising week by week since the implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Regarding material and technical preparations, many newspapers believe that it is necessary to firmly grasp the important link of technical innovation and technical revolution, while also tapping the potential of materials.

　　Many newspapers, while reflecting the situation of various enterprises starting to prepare for next year's production, focused on introducing typical experiences of universal significance. Shaanxi Daily reported that as early as the end of September, Baoji Engineering Machinery Manufacturing Plant made unified arrangements for completing this year's production tasks and preparing for next year's production, organizing two teams to compete and promote each other. As a result, both sides achieved victory. This year's production plan was completed 62 days ahead of schedule, and by November 20, 70% of the total workload for next year's preparation work had also been completed. This fact powerfully answers the question of whether it is possible to prepare for production in the first quarter of next year while comprehensively completing this year's plan.

　　New Hunan Daily, Shanghai Jiefang Daily, Xinwen Daily, Tianjin Daily, Changjiang Daily, and others have all reported on some enterprises mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan for the first quarter of next year and making great efforts in technical innovation to achieve continued leaps forward next year. For example, Tianjin First Machine Tool Plant mobilized all employees to discuss the draft production plan. During the discussion, employees put forward more than 3,600 technical innovation suggestions aimed at the key to a substantial increase in the output of major products in the first quarter; and while making suggestions, they strived to implement them. In just one week, more than 60% of the suggestions within the scope of workshops and departments were implemented, and more than 40% of the 110 or so major key measures for the entire plant were also implemented after more than ten days of intensive efforts. Another example is Shanghai Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory, which fully mobilized the masses to sort and promote the technical innovation projects that were effective this year, and made great efforts in technical innovation to address the key to production, ensuring that the production level in the first quarter of next year will rise step by step under the condition of reduced production personnel. These reports specifically point out the direction for how to prepare for next year's production.

　　Some newspapers introduced practical and feasible experiences in a certain aspect of preparation work. For example, Yunnan Daily reported that Kunming Metallurgical Machinery Plant adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to self-manufacture various indigenous, semi-indigenous and semi-foreign, and foreign production equipment in order to meet the urgent needs of next year's production; Zhejiang Daily reported that the industrial departments of Zhuji, Jiangshan, and other counties actively prepared industrial raw materials for the beginning of next year based on the principle of self-reliance and local material collection, and paid great attention to the utilization of wild plants.

　　While reporting on the industrial sector's preparations for next year's production, Qingdao Daily also raised the issue of the commercial sector striving for a flying start next year, and published an editorial calling on the commercial sector to do a good job in the supply, transportation, and production arrangements of materials for farmland water conservancy construction, the arrangement of industrial production and the supply of raw materials, and the preparation of materials for the New Year and the Spring Festival.

### 为了明年开门红

　　为了明年开门红
    1960年转眼就要到来。各地报纸在大力宣传全面提前完成今年计划的同时，也把注意力放在争取明年开门红的问题上。12月中旬以来，各地报纸逐步加强了这方面的宣传。
    许多报纸就这个问题发表社论，阐明了做好明年第一季度生产准备工作的重大意义。黑龙江日报、沈阳日报等都提出，工业生产是连续性的，今天的生产不是从今天才开始，而是从昨天、前天就开始了。抓紧当前生产，同时准备将来，这是工业生产的客观规律。明年的生产要继续跃进，步步高升，这就更需要在今年为明年做好准备，使明年一开始就来个开门红，从而为全年的跃进打下良好基础。因此，完成今年的生产计划同明年第一季度的生产准备工作，是相辅相成、互相促进的两项工作。
    谈到明年生产准备工作的内容，各地报纸一致强调必须首先做好思想准备工作。天津日报的社论说，生产不断跃进需要思想不断革命。在各项生产准备工作中，首要的是做好思想准备。新湖南报指出，各项准备工作都要靠人去做，靠人发挥最大主观能动性才能做好，所以首要的关键在于做好人的思想工作，继续反透右倾、鼓足干劲。沈阳日报具体批判了影响明年第一季度生产准备工作的种种右倾保守思想和畏难情绪，认为在这个工作中也如在其他工作中一样，存在着两种思想和两种方法的斗争。江西日报一面反对了那些准备工作做得比较好的单位的自满情绪，一面反对了那些工作比较差的单位的消极等待情绪，要求他们立即振作起来，迅速赶上前去。
    各地报纸还论述了组织方面的准备工作和物质技术方面的准备工作。新湖南报指出，要做到明年开门红，必须坚决改变“前松后紧”的旧常规，组织均衡生产，做到有劳有逸，劳逸结合。这就需要组织群众总结今年生产中的先进经验，特别是总结贯彻执行八中全会精神以来生产逐旬上升的经验。关于物质技术方面的准备，不少报纸认为必须紧紧抓住技术革新和技术革命这一重要环节，同时大挖物资潜力。
    许多报纸一面反映各企业着手进行明年生产准备工作的情况，一面着重介绍具有普遍意义的典型经验。陕西日报报道了宝鸡工程机械制造厂早在9月底就对完成今年生产任务和做好明年生产准备作了统一安排，组织了两套人马，互相比赛，互相促进。结果两方面都取得胜利，今年的生产计划已提前六十二天完成，明年的准备工作到11月20日也完成了全部工作量的70％。这个事实有力地解答了在全面完成今年计划的同时，能不能做好明年第一季度生产准备工作的问题。
    新湖南报、上海解放日报、新闻日报、天津日报、长江日报等都报道了一些企业发动群众讨论明年第一季度计划并为实现明年继续跃进大闹技术革新的做法。例如天津第一机床厂发动全厂职工讨论生产计划草案，在讨论中职工们针对第一季度主要产品大量增产的关键，提出了三千六百多项技术革新建议；并且边提建议边争取实现，在短短一星期内，属于车间和科室范围的建议就实现了60％以上，全厂性的一百一十多项重大关键措施，经过十多天的突击，也已实现了40％左右。又如上海石油机械配件厂充分发动群众把今年行之有效的技术革新项目排队推广，并针对生产关键大闹技术革新，保证在生产人员减少的条件下，使明年第一季度的生产水平步步高升。这些报道为如何进行明年的生产准备工作具体地指明了方向。
    有些报纸介绍了某一方面准备工作切实可行的经验。例如，云南日报报道昆明冶金机械厂为了满足明年生产上的迫切需要，采取土洋结合方针，自制各种土的、半土半洋的和洋的生产设备；浙江日报报道了诸暨、江山等县工业部门根据自力更生、就地取材的原则，积极准备明年初的工业原料，而且十分注意野生植物的利用。
    在报道工业部门做好明年生产准备工作的同时，青岛日报还提出了商业部门争取明年开门红的问题，并发表了社论，要求商业部门做好农田水利建设物资的供应、调运和生产安排工作，工业生产的安排和原材料供应工作，以及新年和春节的物资准备工作。
