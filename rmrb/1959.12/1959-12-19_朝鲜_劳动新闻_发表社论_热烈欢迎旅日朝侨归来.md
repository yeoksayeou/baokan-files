Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 17th. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 17th, warmly welcoming the return of Korean residents in Japan.

The editorial said that the return of Korean residents in Japan is our victory, a victory for humanitarianism, truth, and fair public opinion throughout the world.

The editorial said that the reason why Korean residents in Japan are able to return to their country is because they have a people's government and a glorious motherland - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The editorial stated that from the standpoint of international law and humanitarian principles, it is perfectly natural for Korean residents in Japan to return to the embrace of their motherland and abandon their hard lives in foreign countries. They have every right to do so. The editorial pointed out that the reason why the US imperialist stooge, the Syngman Rhee clique, opposes the return of Korean residents in Japan is because it fears that the undeniable crimes committed by the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea will be further exposed to the world.

The editorial said that the Syngman Rhee clique has plunged South Korea into the abyss of hunger and poverty and is planning to sell helpless and starving unemployed farmers to foreign capitalists and plantation owners as slaves under the name of "immigration."

The editorial pointed out that the trust of Korean residents in Japan in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also reflects the feelings of the South Korean people who have suffered under the brutal rule of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, and the feelings of the entire Korean people.

The editorial concluded by saying that the work of repatriating Korean residents in Japan has already begun. In the future, this work will continue strictly in accordance with the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan signed between the Korean Red Cross Society and the Japanese Red Cross Society. No one's obstruction can undermine the right of our compatriots to return to the embrace of their motherland.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论
    热烈欢迎旅日朝侨归来
    新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”17日发表社论，热烈欢迎旅日朝侨归国。
    社论说，旅日朝鲜侨民的回国是我们的胜利，是人道主义、真理和全世界公正舆论的胜利。
    社论说，旅日朝侨所以能够回国，是因为他们有了人民政权和光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。社论说，从国际法的准则和人道主义的原则来看，旅日侨胞回到祖国的怀抱，抛弃他们在外国的艰苦生活，这是十分自然的事情。他们具有一切权利这样做。社论指出，美帝国主义的走狗李承晚集团所以反对旅日朝侨回国是因为害怕李承晚集团在南朝鲜所犯下的无法遮掩的罪行，将进一步暴露在全世界的面前。
    社论说，李承晚集团使南朝鲜落入饥饿和贫困的深渊，而且正在计划以“移民”的名义把无依无靠、饥寒交迫的失业农民卖给外国资本家和种植园园主当奴隶。
    社论指出，旅日朝侨对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的信任也反映了在美帝国主义者和李承晚集团的残暴统治下受尽苦难的南朝鲜人民的心情和全体朝鲜人民的心情。
    社论最后说，遣返旅日朝侨的工作已经开始。今后这项工作将严格按照朝鲜红十字会和日本红十字会之间签订的关于旅日朝侨归国协议继续进行。任何人的任何阻挠都不能破坏我国同胞要回到祖国怀抱的权利。
