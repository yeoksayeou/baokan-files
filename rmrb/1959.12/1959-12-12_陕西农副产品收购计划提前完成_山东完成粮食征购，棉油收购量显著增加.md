Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th: Encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, staff and workers in the grain and commercial systems of Shaanxi Province have completed this year's purchase plan for agricultural and sideline products ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. As of November 28, the completion rate of several major products was as follows: grain 118.87%, cotton 101.39%, oilseeds 122.2%, pigs 100.4%, sheep 129.26%, poultry 111.16%.

    At the beginning of this year's purchase work, relevant departments in various places generally conducted socialist and communist education for cadres and the masses, publicized the General Line and the important significance of agricultural product purchases; criticized the right-leaning thoughts of a few cadres, and encouraged farmers to actively sell agricultural and sideline products to support national construction. Shang County completed the annual purchase task of agricultural and sideline products seventy-three days ahead of schedule after the agricultural and sideline products were put on the market.

    When handing over agricultural and sideline products, people's communes in various places generally attached importance to ensuring quality, and listed quality as one of the important contents for checking and evaluating the completion of tasks. The cotton entering the warehouse has undergone sorting, drying, storage and ginning. Of the cotton sold to the state by Gaoling Commune in Sanyuan County, high-quality cotton accounted for 84.91%, and all the cotton sold was two grades higher than last year.

    While purchasing, various places also properly arranged the lives of commune members, strengthened the supply of materials, and adapted to the production and living needs of rural commune members.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th: Shandong Province has overfulfilled this year's grain purchase plan, and the purchase volume of cotton, peanuts, flue-cured tobacco, hemp, etc. has also increased significantly since the end of November.

    From November 25 to December 3, Shandong Province launched a crash purchase campaign for agricultural and sideline products. A large number of cadres and the masses across the province, as well as tens of thousands of vehicles of all sizes, rushed to pick, process, deliver, and transport various agricultural and sideline products. During this period, the first secretaries of the Party committees at all levels took command and strengthened specific leadership over the purchase work. Penglai County, which is rich in peanuts, has had a lot of rain recently. The Party committees at all levels led the masses to create many methods to reduce moisture, such as drying on sunny days, airing in high air on cloudy days, and baking on stoves on rainy days, which accelerated the progress of peanuts entering the warehouse. In Yidu County, which is rich in flue-cured tobacco, the first secretary of the county party committee personally took charge and closely integrated production and purchase work, properly arranged labor, and rushed to process and deliver flue-cured tobacco, which greatly exceeded the planned daily purchase volume.

    In the spirit of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, various places have also further arranged the lives of commune members. For example, Zibo area inspected the work of 8,175 public canteens while carrying out the crash purchase, and made proper arrangements for the lives of commune members.

    陕西农副产品收购计划提前完成
    山东完成粮食征购，棉油收购量显著增加
    据新华社西安10日电　在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下，陕西省粮食、商业系统的职工已提前超额完成了今年度的农副产品收购计划。到11月28日止，几种主要产品完成计划的情形是：粮食118.87％，棉花101.39％，油料122.2％，猪100.4％，羊129.26％，家禽111.16％。
    今年收购工作一开始，各地有关部门普遍向干部和群众进行了社会主义和共产主义教育，宣传总路线和农产品收购的重要意义；批判了少数干部中的右倾思想，鼓舞了农民积极出售农副产品支援国家建设的热情。商县在农副产品上市后，就提前七十三天完成了全年农副产品的收购任务。
    各地人民公社在交售农副产品时，普遍重视了保证质量，把质量列为检查评比完成任务好坏的重要内容之一。入仓的棉花，都经过分拾、分晒、分存、分轧。三原县高陵公社卖给国家的棉花，优质棉占84.91％，全部出售棉花比去年提高两个等级。
    在收购同时，各地还妥善地安排了社员生活，加强物资供应，适应农村社员们生产和生活上的需要。
    新华社济南10日电　山东省已超额完成今年度的粮食征购计划，棉花、花生、烤烟、大麻等的收购量，11月底以来也有显著的增加。
    在11月25日到12月3日，山东省开展了农副产品突击收购运动，全省有大批干部群众和数以万计的大小车辆，突击采摘、加工、交售、调运各项农副产品。在这期间，各级党委都是第一书记挂帅，对收购工作加强了具体领导。盛产花生的蓬莱县，最近阴雨较多，各级党委领导群众创造出晴天扶垧晒、阴天高空架晾、雨天用炕烘等许多降低水分的办法，加快了花生入库进度。盛产烤烟的益都县，由县委第一书记亲自掌握，将生产和收购工作密切结合起来，妥善安排劳力，突击加工、交售烤烟，使日收购量大大超过计划。
    各地本着统筹兼顾、全面安排的精神，同时进一步安排了社员生活。如淄博地区在突击收购同时，检查了八千一百七十五个公共食堂的工作，对社员生活作了妥善的安排。
