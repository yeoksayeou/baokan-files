Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a report meeting in Beijing today, where Qian Junrui, head of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation, and Liu Shuzhou, deputy head of the delegation, who had returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, gave reports on their visit.

The delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, headed by Qian Junrui and Liu Shuzhou, was invited to Moscow to attend the celebration of the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and visited Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Tallinn, Tashkent and other cities for three weeks.

Qian Junrui reported to more than 1,000 people from all walks of life in the capital that during the delegation's three-week visit to the Soviet Union, they lived in a thick and strong atmosphere of friendship at every moment. The welcome of the Soviet people to the delegation, the brotherly friendship to the Chinese people, and the love for Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, deeply moved the delegation. It will remain in the memory of each of us.

In his report, Qian Junrui listed facts and vividly described the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet Union in various fields. He said that the Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year plan for building communism will be greatly overfulfilled and completed ahead of schedule, which will further strengthen the socialist camp and the world's forces for defending peace. The achievements of the Soviet Union's construction, the high enthusiasm and soaring energy of the Soviet people in building communism, have given great encouragement to the Chinese people who are building socialism. The Soviet people were, are, and will always be a model for us to learn from.

Qian Junrui finally emphasized that Sino-Soviet friendship is an eternal and unbreakable friendship built on the basis of proletarian internationalism. All conspiracies by imperialism to undermine Sino-Soviet friendship and unity are futile. On the road to building socialism and communism, we will always do everything possible to consolidate and strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, and consolidate and strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In his report, Liu Shuzhou gave a detailed introduction to the delegation's visits to various parts of the Soviet Union, and introduced the achievements of the Soviet Union in industry, agriculture, science, culture, and education. He said that we are very happy about this, because the achievements of the Soviet Union are the achievements of our socialist camp. He also specifically introduced the situation of the communist construction labor brigade movement in the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet people are actively involved in this movement with great enthusiasm. They not only demand to maximize labor productivity, but also to make themselves a new generation with communist ideas and style in all aspects.

Li Dequan and Shao Lizi, vice presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Cao Jinghua and Liao Mosha, vice presidents of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and members of the delegation to the Soviet Union attended today's report meeting. Sudarikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, was invited to attend the report meeting.
