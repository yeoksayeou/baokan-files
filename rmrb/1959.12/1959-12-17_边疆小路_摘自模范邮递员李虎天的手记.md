    Borderland Path
    —Excerpts from the Diary of Model Postman Li Hutian
    [Korean Nationality] Jin Zhe
    As dusk descends on the valley, walking, walking, the endless mountain path, carrying a full bag of newspapers and letters, hacking through thorns and brambles, today another hundred *li* traveled.
    Singing mountain songs, gazing into the distance, not caring about the raging wind and snow, or the rugged mountain road.
    Relaying letters from home to sons and daughters far away, delivering shy love letters from first loves.
    Don't underestimate this bulging mailbag, inside it is filled with laughter that will shake the valley, and the thousands of words left behind by the martyrs who stopped breathing on this road.
    Fist-sized lead characters are shouting loudly: the Thirteen Tombs have opened the floodgates, the Baotou Steel Works has produced its first batch of molten steel...
    Old Grandpa with the long beard must be smiling so much his eyes are squinting.
    The hunter lives in the place where the fairy bathes; the old man says that dragons will rise there; sure enough, his second son became a hero and saw Chairman Mao in Tiananmen Square.
    Sending the only daughter, who graduated from university, to the Gobi Desert, you, the old mother whose home is by the spring, tears of longing have soaked your clothes, ah, Ge Budan has given birth to a small baby.
    When you suddenly see the photo of this little fellow, those joyful tears, I have no time to look at them!
    Walking, walking, on the borderland path, to seek the open hearts of the people, to drink a ladle of mountain village spring water to moisten the throat, to drink a bowl of boiling soybean paste soup to warm the whole body, walking, on this stern and long journey of life, let the rings of the old tree record the postman's loyalty.

    边疆小路
    ——摘自模范邮递员李虎天的手记
    〔朝鲜族〕金哲黄昏降临到了山谷，走呀走呀，无尽头的深山小路，掮挂着一满包报纸信件，披荆斩棘，今天又走了百里路。口唱着山歌眼望着远方，哪管它风狂雪暴山路崎岖。传告远方儿女的家信，送递初恋的令人羞赧的情书。不要小瞧这鼓囊囊的邮包，里面装有震撼山谷的笑声，和在这条路上停止了呼吸的烈士们留下来的千言万语。拳头般大的铅字在大喊大叫：十三陵打开了水闸门，包钢流出了第一炉钢水……毛胡子大爷准笑得眯着眼睛。猎人住在仙女沐浴的地方，老人说那里会有蛟龙腾起；果然他的二儿子当上了英雄，在天安门广场见到了毛主席。把大学毕业的独女送到戈壁，你那家住泉水边的老妈妈，思念的泪水湿透了你的衣带，啊，戈卜旦生了一个小娃娃。你突然看到这小家伙的照片，那欢乐的眼泪啊，我那有工夫瞧它！走呀走呀，在边疆小路上，去寻找人们敞开的心，喝一瓢山村的泉水润润喉咙，饮一碗滚沸的酱汤温暖全身，走呀，在这严峻的人生长途上，让老树的年轮记下邮递员的忠诚。
