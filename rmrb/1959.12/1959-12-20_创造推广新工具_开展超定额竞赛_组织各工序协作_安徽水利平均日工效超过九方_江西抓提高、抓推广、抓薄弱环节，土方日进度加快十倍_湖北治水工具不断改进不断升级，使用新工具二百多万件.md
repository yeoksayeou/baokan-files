This newspaper Hefei, December 19th dispatch: Anhui Province's high work efficiency water conservancy movement, with technological innovation as its central content, has achieved a great victory. As of December 17th, the province has completed earth and stone work exceeding the 1 billion cubic meter mark, accounting for 30.9% of the total task for this winter and next spring, with an average daily work efficiency of 9.53 cubic meters per person. Among them, Fuyang Prefecture has completed 48.4% of its task, Wuhu Prefecture has completed 40.8%, and She County in southern Anhui exceeded its total water conservancy task for this winter and next spring by 14% on the 13th of this month.

From the beginning of this year, Anhui has focused on reforming water conservancy tools and technological innovation. In addition to organizing a large number of factories in the rear to serve tool reform, various regions have also transferred more than 135,000 iron and wood technicians to establish more than 15,000 tool manufacturing plants and repair shops/groups at water conservancy construction sites. This professional team, combined with mass inventions and creations, has created and modified more than 1.8 million sets of advanced tools. The use of these advanced tools has rapidly increased work efficiency. For example, after Fuyang Prefecture vigorously reformed tools and basically eliminated carrying by shoulder poles, the daily work efficiency per person quickly increased to more than 12 cubic meters, which is seven times higher than the daily work efficiency in the same period last year.

In the high work efficiency movement, Anhui widely utilized animal power, mechanical power, and wind power. In terms of utilizing animal power, regions have universally used oxen to pull double-wheeled double-furrow plows to loosen soil, oxen to pull pulley carts to transport soil, and oxen to pull stone rollers to compact soil, generally making each animal equivalent to the work efficiency of four laborers. In terms of utilizing mechanical power, the Zhang Youdao Youth Shock Brigade in Su County used a 3.5 horsepower gas engine to drive a pulley cart to transport soil, with a daily work efficiency of 300 to 350 cubic meters. In terms of utilizing wind power, the Liu圩 Commune in Si County modified a windmill waterwheel to drive a pulley cart to transport soil. In a level two wind, with a transport distance of 25 meters, it transported 350 cubic meters of soil per day.

Anhui has universally established labor quotas and launched over-quota competitions in water conservancy. The labor quotas set by various regions for water conservancy are based on the average advanced work efficiency, and the content of the quota is to set tasks, set time, set quality, and set work points, and to give commendations and material rewards to commune members who exceed the quota. At present, quotas are being broken every day on various water conservancy construction sites, and new records are being added every day. Among the more than 2 million youths and 25,000 youth shock brigades, 540,000 have broken quotas, 40,000 have completed double quotas, and more than 20,000 youth shock brigades have broken quotas and completed double quotas.

Various regions have also scientifically organized labor combinations, universally forming various specialized teams for digging, loading, transporting, unloading, etc., based on each person's labor strength and skills. On the basis of the division of labor, they have implemented a one-stop joint operation, tightly linking processes to avoid idle work. The Jian Changyin Shock Brigade at the Yihu Reservoir construction site in Lujiang County had an average daily work efficiency of 5 cubic meters per person at the beginning of construction in early November. Later, they implemented a rapid assembly line operation method for digging, transporting, unloading, and compacting soil, achieving loading without waiting for digging, transporting without waiting for loading, and unloading without waiting for transporting. By November 28th, the average work efficiency soared to 24.1 cubic meters.

Currently, Anhui Province's high work efficiency water conservancy movement is developing more deeply and extensively.

This newspaper Nanchang, December 19th dispatch: In carrying out the high work efficiency water conservancy movement, Jiangxi has focused on creation, promotion, improvement, supporting measures, and weak links, launching a mass movement to create a situation of "wave after wave higher, everywhere higher," making water conservancy construction both fast and good.

At present, the average daily progress in Jiangxi Province has reached 4 million cubic meters of earth and stone, which is ten times faster than the previous period. To date, the province has built 34,500 water conservancy projects, completing 120 million cubic meters of earth and stone, which is more than three times faster than in the same period last year.

In September, as soon as the curtain was raised on water conservancy construction, Party committees at all levels in Jiangxi dispatched a large number of cadres to the construction sites, established construction site Party committees and Party branches, and strengthened leadership. At the same time, Party committees at all levels across the province seized on advanced models and established pace-setters, quickly setting up examples of high work efficiency; and organized migrant workers to carry out competitions to catch up with the advanced and strive to be pace-setters, promoting the widespread and in-depth development of the high work efficiency movement. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee established Dongxiang County, Linchuan County, Ziyunshan Reservoir in Fengcheng County, and the "July 1st" Reservoir in Yushan County as province-wide pace-setters, and successively held on-site meetings and broadcast meetings in these places, calling on and encouraging all regions to learn from and catch up with the pace-setters, setting off a wave of competition, thereby promoting the high work efficiency movement across the province to develop forward wave after wave.

In promoting advanced tools and advanced construction experience, Jiangxi paid close attention to improvement, so that advanced tools and advanced experience would be continuously improved and perfected in the process of promotion, thereby pushing the high work efficiency movement to a higher and newer stage. After Shangqu Reservoir in Gaoan County realized mechanized blasting for soil extraction, the construction site Party committee mobilized migrant workers to innovate blasting technology and create a method of directional blasting for dam construction, blasting out a mountain river channel that would have taken 5,000 labor days to build in one shot. Afterwards, the migrant workers created a method of throwing and discarding blasting, blasting 100,000 cubic meters of soil in one shot, building a channel that would have taken 15,000 labor days to build. This created a relatively complete set of blasting and soil extraction experience.

In the high work efficiency movement, Jiangxi focused on supporting advanced tools and advanced experience, from point to area, to achieve high work efficiency in every construction process. The Meiling Reservoir construction site Party committee in Shangyou County mobilized migrant workers to reform tools. The migrant workers put forward more than 1,000 suggestions and reformed various tools, achieving high work efficiency in transporting and compacting soil. At the same time, the construction site Party committee also sent special personnel to fraternal reservoirs to learn from the experience of blasting soil extraction and automatic unloading; after returning to the construction site after learning, they immediately vigorously promoted it. In less than 20 days, Meiling Reservoir achieved high speed construction in every construction process.

While grasping supporting measures, Party committees at all levels in Jiangxi also focused on the weak links in the high work efficiency movement to achieve high work efficiency everywhere. In the past, high work efficiency was done well in plain areas, but poorly in hilly areas, especially mountainous areas; high work efficiency was done well in large-scale construction sites, but poorly in medium-sized and especially small-sized construction sites; high work efficiency was done well in newly built construction sites, but high work efficiency activities were rarely carried out in rehabilitated construction sites. This year, Party committees at all levels conscientiously grasped this work, thereby eliminating these weak links in the high work efficiency movement. In the Gannan region, where mountainous areas account for more than 75% of the total area, all water conservancy construction sites universally carried out high work efficiency movements based on the construction characteristics of mountainous areas, which was five times faster than in previous years, completing 1 million cubic meters of earth and stone every day.

Now, Jiangxi's water conservancy technological revolution is moving towards the comprehensive realization of semi-mechanization.

This newspaper Wuhan, December 19th dispatch: A high work efficiency construction upsurge in water conservancy centered on tool reform is raging across Hubei Province.

According to incomplete statistics, the province has invested more than 2.5 million improved tools in construction. These tools generally increase work efficiency by one to two times, and some increase it by dozens to more than a hundred times. Due to the continuous reform of water control tools and the continuous improvement of work efficiency, many water conservancy projects have greatly accelerated the construction progress, shortened the construction period, and saved labor. To date, the province has completed more than 71,800 large and small water conservancy projects, completing a total of 280 million cubic meters of earth and stone.

This year, Hubei Province has paid close attention to the reform of water conservancy tools in various regions, and has taken quick action and high quality. During the large-scale anti-drought struggle in August and September, various regions combined the reform of anti-drought tools and actively started preparing for the reform of water conservancy construction tools. Before the large-scale start of water control projects in many regions, a group of technical forces were organized to identify various advanced water control tools from last winter and this spring, vigorously imitate and promote them, and reform and improve them on the original basis. According to incomplete statistics from Jingzhou Prefecture alone, more than 1.2 million advanced water conservancy tools were repaired and newly manufactured before the start of construction.

In the large-scale water conservancy tool movement in Hubei Province, great attention has been paid to the continuous improvement and upgrading of tools, so that various types of work can be continuously innovated and work efficiency can be continuously improved. After Hanyang County eliminated carrying soil by shoulder pole at water conservancy construction sites throughout the county, it launched a large-scale tool upgrade movement, proposing to replace human power with animal power and machinery, and vigorously develop soil machinery and local-foreign combined mechanical soil transportation and tamping tools. Now, more than 40 construction sites across the county have further realized soil mechanization and semi-mechanization on the basis of cart use.

In order to strengthen the specific leadership of the water conservancy tool reform, responsible cadres in many regions of the province have gone deep into the construction sites to discover problems and solve problems. (Attached photo)

    创造推广新工具　开展超定额竞赛　组织各工序协作
    安徽水利平均日工效超过九方
    江西抓提高、抓推广、抓薄弱环节，土方日进度加快十倍
    湖北治水工具不断改进不断升级，使用新工具二百多万件
    本报合肥19日电　安徽省以技术革新为中心内容的治水高工效运动已经取得巨大胜利。到12月17日为止，全省所做土石方工程已突破十亿立方大关，占今冬明春总任务的30.9％，平均每人每日工效达九点五三公方。其中阜阳专区已完成任务48.4％，芜湖专区已完成40.8％，皖南的歙县，已在本月13日超额14％完成了今冬明春兴修总任务。
    安徽今年一开始就大抓治水工具改革和技术革新。各地除在后方组织了大批工厂为工具改革服务外，并抽调了十三万五千多名铁、木技工，在水利工地上设立了一万五千多个工具制造厂和修配厂、修配组。这支专业队伍和群众性的发明创造结合起来以后，共创制和改制先进工具一百八十多万套。这些先进工具的使用，使工效飞速提高。如阜阳专区在大搞工具改革，基本消灭挑抬以后，每人日工效很快提高到十二方以上，比去年同期日工效提高了七倍。
    在高工效运动中，安徽各地广泛运用畜力、机械动力和风力。在利用畜力方面，各地已普遍用牛拉双轮双铧犁松土，牛拉滑车运土，牛拉石碾压土，一般每头牲畜等于四个劳力的工效。在利用机械动力方面，宿县张友道青年突击队使用三点五马力煤气机带动滑车运土，日工效达三百到三百五十立方米。在利用风力方面，泗县刘圩公社，改装风力水车带动滑车运土，在二级风时，运距二十五米，一天运土三百五十立方米。
    安徽各地在治水中普遍制定了劳动定额，开展了超定额的竞赛。各地制定治水劳动定额都以平均先进工效为标准，定额的内容是定任务、定时间、定质量、定工分，并对超过定额的社员给予表扬和物质奖励。目前，各水利工地上定额天天被突破，新纪录天天增加。仅二百多万青年和二万五千个青年突击队中，突破定额的就有五十四万人，完成双倍定额的有四万人，突破定额和完成双倍定额的青年突击队达二万多个。
    各地还科学地组织劳动组合，普遍根据每个人的劳力强弱和技能分别组成挖、装、运、卸等各种专业队，并在分工的基础上，实行了一条龙联合作战，使工序与工序之间环环扣紧，不窝工。庐江县移湖水库工地柬昌银突击队，在开工初期的11月初，每人平均日工效是五立方米，后来实行挖土、运土、卸土、压土等工序快速流水作业法，做到装不等挖、运不等装、卸不等运，到11月28日平均工效陡增到二十四点一立方米。
    目前，安徽省治水高工效运动正在更深入更广泛地发展。
    本报南昌19日电　在开展水利高工效运动中，江西各地抓创造，抓推广，抓提高，抓配套，抓薄弱环节，大搞群众运动，使高工效运动出现了“浪浪高、处处高”的形势，水利兴修既快又好。
    目前，江西全省平均日进度达四百万土石方，比前期加快了十倍。至今全省已经建成三万四千五百座水利工程，完成土石方一亿二千万方，与去年同期比较，速度加快了三倍多。
    9月间，水利兴修序幕一揭开，江西各级党委就派出了大批干部上工地，成立了工地党委会、党支部，加强了领导。同时全省各级党委抓先进、立标兵，迅速树起了高工效的榜样；并组织民工开展赶先进、争标兵的竞赛，推动高工效运动的广泛深入的开展。中共江西省委树立东乡县、临川县和丰城县紫云山水库、玉山县“七一”水库为全省标兵，先后在这些地方召开了现场会、广播会，号召与鼓动各地学标兵、赶标兵，掀起竞赛热潮，从而推动了全省高工效运动一浪高过一浪地向前发展。
    在推广先进工具、先进施工经验中，江西各地很注意抓提高的工作，使先进工具、先进经验在推广中不断提高、更加完善，从而把高工效运动推向更高、更新的阶段。高安县上渠水库实现了取土爆破化后，工地党委又发动民工革新爆破技术，创造了定向爆破筑坝的方法，一炮筑成了一条要花五千个劳动日才能筑成的山川渠道。之后，民工们创造了扬弃爆破的方法，一炮扬土十万方，筑成了一条要花一万五千个劳动日才能筑成的渠道。这样创造了一套较完善的爆破取土经验。
    在高工效运动中，江西各地大抓先进工具配套、先进经验配套，由点到面，以实现个个施工工序高工效。上犹县梅岭水库工地党委发动民工改革工具，民工提出一千多条建议，改革各种工具，实现了运土、压土高工效。与此同时，工地党委又派出专人到兄弟水库学习爆破取土、自动卸土等经验；学习后回到工地，立即大力推广，前后不到二十天，梅岭水库就实现了个个工序施工高速度。
    在抓配套的同时，江西各级党委还大抓高工效运动中的薄弱环节，以实现处处高工效。过去，平原地区高工效搞得好，丘陵、特别是山区搞得较差；大型工地高工效搞得好，中型、特别是小型工地搞得较差；新修工程工地高工效搞得好，复修工程工地很少开展高工效活动。今年各级党委认真抓好了这一工作，因而消除了高工效运动中的这些薄弱环节。山区占总面积75％以上的赣南区，各水利工地根据山区施工特点普遍开展了高工效运动，比往年快了五倍，每天完成土石方达一百万方。
    现在，江西各地水利技术革新正向全面实现半机械化前进。
    本报武汉19日电　一个以工具改革为中心的水利高工效施工热潮，正在湖北省各地猛烈开展。
    据不完全统计，全省投入施工的各种改良工具已有二百五十多万件。这些工具一般都使工效提高一倍到二倍以上，有的提高几十倍到百多倍。由于治水工具不断改革，工效不断提高，很多水利工程大大地加快了施工进度，缩短了工期，节省了劳力。到目前止，全省已完成大、小水利工程七万一千八百多处，总共完成土、石方二亿八千万立方米。
    今年湖北省各地对水利工具的改革，都很注意，并且行动快，质量高。当8、9月间，各地在进行大规模抗旱斗争时，就结合抗旱工具的改革，积极着手水利施工工具改革的准备。许多地区在治水工程大开工之前，就组织一批技术力量对去冬今春的各种治水先进工具，分别作了鉴定，大力仿造推广，并在原有基础上加以改革提高。仅据荆州专区不完全统计，在开工前，就整修和新制了一百二十多万件先进水利工具。
    湖北省各地在大搞水利工具运动中，十分注意工具的不断改进、不断升级，从而使各种工种不断推陈出新，工效不断提高。汉阳县在全县水利工地消灭肩挑运土以后，又大搞工具升级运动，提出以畜力、机械代替人力，大搞土机械和土洋结合机械的运土、打夯工具。现在，全县有四十多个工地已在车子化基础上，进一步实现了土机械化和半机械化。
    为了加强对水利工具改革的具体领导，全省许多地区的负责干部都深入工地，发现问题，解决问题。（附图片）
