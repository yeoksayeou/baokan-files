Introduction to Fine Breed Pigs

    According to their origins, pigs raised in our country are divided into Chinese breeds and foreign breeds. Due to different natural conditions, feeding management methods, and needs in various regions, pigs have formed different local varieties. Generally speaking, China's excellent pig breeds have the characteristics of early maturity, high litter size, habit of eating roughage, good meat quality, strong adaptability to the environment, strong disease resistance, and good quality bristles. Here are some excellent pig breeds:

　　Xin Jin Pig
    Produced in Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, it is now distributed almost all over the northern regions. The Xin Jin pig looks very much like the Berkshire pig, with a black body, thin skin, and sparse hair. The Xin Jin pig matures early, grows quickly, produces many litters, is resistant to roughage, has strong resistance, and is docile in temperament. Its disadvantage is that there are more individuals with incorrect limb postures. The live weight of fattening pigs of this breed is generally 150 to 175 kilograms at twelve months, and the slaughter rate of general fattening pigs is over 80%.

　　Daweizi Pig
    It is an excellent lard-meat pig breed in Changsha County, Hunan. The Daweizi pig matures early and is easy to fatten. A pig fattened for one year can grow to 200 kilograms. It is resistant to roughage, has fine muscle fibers, and the sow has strong reproductive capacity.

　　Subei Pig
    Produced in Rugao, Taixing, and Taixian areas of Jiangsu, among which the pigs produced in Dalunzhuang, Taixian County, are the most famous. Although the Subei pig is not large in size, it matures early and is easy to fatten. Generally, it can reach a weight of 75 to 80 kilograms at ten months. It has a high reproduction rate. Sows can give birth to four to five litters in two years, with an average of 11.3 piglets per litter. According to experiments, this pig needs 4.9 kilograms of feed (mainly concentrate) for every kilogram of weight gain.

　　Rongchang White Pig
    Originally produced in Rongchang, Longchang, and Luzhou areas of Sichuan, it is representative of Sichuan white pigs and is distributed in eastern, northern, and southern Sichuan, and is very popular among the masses. The Rongchang pig is white all over, except that there are black circles of varying sizes around the eyes. It has a lot of fat and good bristles. Abdominal fat accounts for about 9.8% of body weight. The bristles are white, glossy, and 11 to 13 centimeters long.

　　Neijiang Black Pig
    Originally produced in Neijiang and Zizhong areas of Sichuan Province, it is mainly distributed in Neijiang Prefecture, Neijiang, Zizhong, Ziyang, Jianyang, Weiyuan, and other counties. It is representative of Sichuan large black pigs. The sow has a relatively strong reproductive capacity, with an average of 12.7 piglets per litter. Fattening pigs generally gain about 0.4 kilograms per day, and can reach a weight of 200 kilograms in 15 to 20 months. It has a lot of fat, but thick skin.

　　Ningxiang Pig
    Produced in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province. Resistance to rough feeding and fast growth are the special and excellent properties of the Ningxiang pig. The weight of a two-month-old piglet is generally about 12.5 kilograms, and the weight of a pig that has grown for ten months can reach more than 100 kilograms. The Ningxiang pig has a strong reproductive capacity, and can produce 12 to 14 piglets per litter, and as many as 17 or 18. This pig has delicious meat, evenly distributed fat and lean meat, and also a lot of back fat. A pig weighing about 100 kilograms can yield 7-8 kilograms of back fat. The disadvantage is that it is relatively weak.

　　Duoshan Pig
    Produced in Rushan County, Shandong Province, it is bred by crossbreeding Bozhong pigs and local pigs. It has a long body and strong limbs. Fast growth is an advantage of the Duoshan pig. Generally, it can grow to 150 kilograms one year after birth and 200 to 300 kilograms in two years. However, the sow's reproductive capacity is relatively average, producing eight to ten piglets per litter.
