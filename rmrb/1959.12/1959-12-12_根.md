    Root
    Wang Changfu
    Once, I heard someone analyzing the characteristics of locust trees and black pines, and some thoughts arose.

    Locust trees and black pines are both economically valuable trees and are quite useful to people, which we won't discuss for the moment. The biggest characteristic of the locust tree is that it grows quickly, and it can be classified as one of the fast-growing trees. However, it has a major weakness, which is that it is afraid of wind. It shakes when the wind blows; a small wind causes small shaking, a medium wind causes medium shaking, and a large wind causes large shaking; medium shaking causes it to lean, and large shaking causes it to fall. Scientists have found the root of its problem after analysis and research; it turns out that the roots are not strong. It only has lateral roots and fine roots, but no central root or large roots.

    The biggest characteristic of the black pine is that it has a very strong character and very vigorous vitality. It can not only grow strongly in better soil, but even under the most difficult conditions, such as in poor mountains and remote ridges, where the soil is very thin, it can also penetrate rocks and grow into large timber with lush foliage and strong trunks. This is something that ordinary trees cannot match. Why is the black pine so strong? Because it has strong central and large roots as its center, and also has numerous lateral roots. Therefore, it can stand upright in the face of fierce winds and heavy rain. The black pine's firm and tenacious character and its vigorous vitality have always been praised by Chinese poets and have become a model for people to learn from.

    This made me think that, within our revolutionary ranks, the vast majority of people are like black pines. Since joining the revolution, they have undergone severe trials of struggle, their positions are very firm, their characters are very tenacious, they have great communist ideals, and they have a red heart to serve the people wholeheartedly. They have a strong foundation—proletarian revolutionary consciousness. Therefore, whether in fair weather or in stormy seas, they always stand upright like black pines, and under the correct guidance of the Party, they overcome all difficulties and bravely advance, constantly promoting the great socialist revolution and socialist construction. These "black pines" are the standard-bearers of the unyielding revolutionary red flag and the guarantee of the victory of the Chinese revolution!

    However, in our ranks, there are also a few "locust trees." In calm conditions, they can still stand up straight, sprout and grow leaves, and breathe the same air and share the same destiny with the great Party, the great revolution, and the great masses. Therefore, they can also do things that are beneficial to the revolution. However, once the climate changes, a strong wind blows, and a rainstorm comes, they shake like locust trees, and even fall down. This is because their inferior nature has not been transformed, and they do not have the tenacious roots like black pines. Naturally, the "locust trees" in the revolutionary ranks can receive valuable help because they are in this strong "black pine" forest, so only a very few fall down. However, to become strong, the main thing is to establish revolutionary main roots.

    一次听到有人分析洋槐与黑松的特性，产生了一些感想。
    洋槐和黑松都是很有经济价值的树木，对人们用处不小，这姑且不谈。洋槐的最大特点是长得快，在树木中可列为速长的一类。但是它有一个很大的弱点，就是怕风。风一吹就动摇，小风小摇，中风中摇，大风大摇；中摇则歪，大摇则倒。科学家经过分析研究，找到了它的病根，原来是根子不牢。原来它只有旁根、细根，而无中根和大根。
    黑松最大的特点是，具有很坚强的性格和非常旺盛的生命力，它不仅在较好的土壤中能够茁壮生长，即使在最艰难的条件下，如在穷山、僻岭，土壤很薄的地方，它也能穿石而过，长成叶茂干坚的大材。这实在是一般树所不及的。黑松为什么如此坚强？因为它有坚强的中根和大根作为中枢，而且还有繁多的旁根。因此它在狂风猛击、暴雨倾打中能够兀立不倒。黑松这种坚定顽强的性格和它的旺盛的生命力，历来为我国诗人所赞颂，成为人们学习的榜样。
    这就使我联想到，在我们革命队伍内部，像黑松那样的人占绝对的大多数。他们参加革命以来，经过严重的斗争考验，立场十分坚定，性格非常顽强，有伟大的共产主义理想，有一颗全心全意为人民服务的红心。他们有着坚强的根基——无产阶级革命意识，因此，无论是在风和日丽的天气下，还是在惊涛骇浪里，他们总像黑松一样，挺立不歪，在党的正确指引下，排除万难奋勇前进，使伟大的社会主义革命与社会主义建设事业向前不断推进。这些“黑松”是不倒的革命红旗的旗手，是中国革命胜利的保证！
    但是，在我们的队伍里，也还有少数的“洋槐”。他们在风平浪静的条件下，还能够站直身子，发芽长叶，还能够和伟大的党、伟大的革命、伟大的群众，同呼吸，共命运，因此，也就能够做出应该做的对革命有益的事情。但是，一旦气候发生了变化，刮起了大风，下来了阵雨，他们就像洋槐一样动摇起来，甚至倒了下去。这就是因为他们的劣根性没有改造，没有像黑松那样的坚韧不拔的根。自然，革命队伍中的“洋槐”，因为处身在这坚强的“黑松”大森林中，能够得到珍贵的帮助，所以倒下去的总是极少数。但是，要变得坚强起来，主要还是要扎起革命的主根来。
