Grasp Herbaceous Oil Crops with One Hand, Woody Oil Crops with the Other
Rural Sichuan Vigorously Plants Oil Tea

(Our dispatch) Sichuan is simultaneously promoting the production of herbaceous and woody oil crops. Currently, a mass movement of "10,000-mu communes, 1,000-mu teams, and ten plants per person" for planting oil tea is underway in vast rural areas. Since this spring, over 1.5 million mu of new oil tea forests have been planted in various regions.

Sichuan's climate and soil are well-suited for growing oil tea. In the past, only parts of eastern and southern Sichuan had the habit of planting oil tea. Since liberation, oil tea production in Sichuan has begun to develop. More than 3 million mu of new oil tea forests have been planted successively, equivalent to seven times the area before liberation. In the past, oil tea trees took seven or eight years to flower and bear fruit, but it has now been proven that this slow growth can be changed. For example, the oil tea trees planted in Huangjueping People's Commune, Yibin City, in 1957 flowered and bore fruit this year.

Now is the season for direct seeding of oil tea forests. Party committees at all levels in Sichuan are seizing this opportunity to vigorously launch a crash program for planting oil tea forests. Luxian County, under the slogan of "every commune plants oil tea, every household plants oil tea," has launched a "two-five" movement, i.e., each person plants five oil tea plants and five bamboo plants around their houses. The whole county is mobilizing, combining professional teams with crash movements, and has organized a forestry team of more than 1,000 people to create large forests, while every household creates scattered forests. Commune members in Wazi, Tianyang, and other communes have set up camps on the mountains and planted more than 1,000 mu of tea forests in two days. Lezhi County, which originally had no oil tea trees, has planted 50,000 jin of seeds. All county officials and urban residents are using their holidays to plant oil tea forests.

While vigorously developing new oil tea forests, old oil tea producing areas are also seizing the work of reclaiming barren tea forests. Luzhou, Yibin, and other places have established a large number of forestry professional teams to manage oil tea forests. Luxian County has fully implemented increased production measures such as fertilization, watering, cultivation, pest control, and tool improvement in the reclamation process, and has promoted many advanced experiences in reclamation, striving to achieve profits in the first year, increased production in the second year, and a bumper harvest in the third year. In order to complete the plan for developing oil tea production, all localities have made plans, which have been discussed by the masses, and cadres at all levels have taken the lead in planting and managing oil tea forests. Many local cadres have also planted oil tea experimental fields. The province's commercial departments are vigorously transferring seeds and carrying out technical training. The oil tea seeds purchased by various localities this year have all been stopped from being pressed for oil, so as to supply seed-deficient areas for planting oil tea.

    一手抓草本油料　一手抓木本油料
    四川农村大种油茶
    本报讯　四川一手抓草本油料生产，一手抓木本油料生产。目前广大农村在掀起一个“万亩社、千亩队、一人十窝”的大种油茶运动。今年春天以来，各地已造油茶林一百五十多万亩。
    四川省气候和土壤都适合种植油茶。过去全省只川东、川南部分地区有种植油茶的习惯。解放以来，四川省油茶生产开始得到发展，先后植造新油茶林三百多万亩，相当解放前面积的七倍。过去油茶要七、八年开花结果，现在证明这种生长缓慢的现象可以改变。如宜宾市黄桷坪人民公社，1957年种的油茶，今年就开花结果了。
    现在正是油茶直播造林的季节。四川全省各级党委抓紧这一时机，大力开展突击造油茶林运动。泸县在“社社种油茶、户户种油茶”的口号下，开展了一个“二五”运动，即每人利用屋前屋后种油茶五株、竹子五株。全县人人动手，采取专业队和突击运动相结合的办法，组织了一千多人的林业队造成片林，家家户户造零星林。瓦子、天洋等公社的社员上山安营扎寨，两天内造茶林一千多亩。原来没有油茶树的乐至县，已种了五万斤种子。全县机关干部、城镇居民都利用假日植造油茶林。
    和大力发展新油茶林的同时，油茶老产区还抓住荒芜茶林的垦复工作。泸州、宜宾等地都建立了大批林业专业队经营油茶林。泸县在垦复中全面贯彻了肥、水、抚育、防治病害、改良工具等增产措施，推行了许多垦复的先进经验，力争做到头年得利，二年增产，三年丰收。为了完成发展油茶生产的计划，各地都做了规划，经过群众性的讨论，由各级干部带头种植和管好油茶林。许多地方干部还种了油茶试验田。全省商业部门大力调进种子，开展技术传授等工作。各地今年收购的油茶籽已全部停止榨油，以便供应缺种地区种植油茶。
