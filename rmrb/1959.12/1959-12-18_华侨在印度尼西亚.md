Overseas Chinese have resided in Indonesia for more than 1,500 years. Throughout these long years, the Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people have shared weal and woe, and lived in close harmony. Together with the Indonesian people, they have blazed trails, developed Indonesia's rich fields and mines, and shed blood alongside the Indonesian people in the fight against Dutch colonial rule and Japanese fascist aggression. The hard work of the Overseas Chinese has made indelible contributions to Indonesia's economic and cultural development. (Attached pictures)

This is an Overseas Chinese worker on a tin mine.
    ?In the early days of developing the Belitung tin mine, Overseas Chinese miners used Chinese-style waterwheels to draw mine water.
    ?This is a small river called "Red Creek" near Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. In 1740, Overseas Chinese and Indonesian people fought fiercely with the Dutch colonial army here to resist the rule of the Dutch colonialists, and many Overseas Chinese sacrificed their lives, staining the creek with blood. To commemorate this heroic battle, later generations called this small river "Red Creek."

    华侨在印度尼西亚
    我国侨民旅居印度尼西亚已经有一千五百多年的历史。在这悠久的年月中，华侨和印度尼西亚人民同甘苦、共患难，亲密相处。他们和印度尼西亚人民一起披荆斩棘，开发了印度尼西亚富饶的田园和矿山，在反对荷兰的殖民统治和日本法西斯的侵略中，无数的华侨和印度尼西亚人民在一起流了鲜血。华侨辛勤的劳动对印度尼西亚的经济和文化的发展作出了不能磨灭的贡献。（附图片）
