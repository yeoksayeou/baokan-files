Winter is also a good season for afforestation

    The production practice of the vast number of farmers in our country proves that afforestation can be carried out in all seasons. Even in the severe winter, it is also a good season for afforestation. There are numerous successful examples of winter afforestation all over the country. The Masson pine forests planted in late December 1957 and mid-January 1958 in the Liuwan Forest Farm in Yulin County, Guangxi, had a survival rate of about 90%; the Chinese fir forest planted in mid-December 1954 in the Shuxi Commune in Huitong County, Hunan Province, had a survival rate of 98% in a 1958 survey, and the young trees were as tall as eight chi; the large area of eucommia ulmoides forest planted in the winter of 1953 in the Cili Forest Farm in Hunan Province had a survival rate of 98% in a 1958 survey, and the young trees were more than one zhang tall; Ji Linqing, a national model forestry worker in Jixi County, Anhui Province, conducted continuous four-season Chinese fir cutting experiments from 1953 to 1955, and the survival rate of winter cuttings reached 85%-95%; Baixiang County, Hebei Province, planted poplar forests in sandy wasteland in the winter of 1954 and 1955, with a survival rate of 90%. These examples show that whether in southern or northern China, whether coniferous or broad-leaved tree species, winter afforestation has achieved good results. Xilou Commune in Huitong County, Hunan Province, has summarized three major advantages of winter afforestation from practice: First, agricultural work is lighter in winter, which is convenient for arranging labor; second, tree seedlings are in a dormant state in winter, and the seedlings are not easily damaged during transplantation. In the second year after planting, the seedlings take root before sprouting leaves, making it easier to survive; third, winter afforestation is conducive to intercropping coarse grains in the forest, which not only avoids affecting the growth of young forests due to sowing coarse grains, but also achieves the effect of forest and grain growing together.

    To achieve high survival rates and healthy growth of tree seedlings in winter afforestation (as in other seasons), it is necessary to adopt afforestation techniques that are appropriate to the time and local conditions, based on the physiological activities of the seedlings themselves and the characteristics of the environmental conditions of the afforestation site. For seedling survival, winter afforestation has many favorable conditions, but also some unfavorable conditions. Southern China has a warm and humid climate, and winter afforestation has more favorable factors, and there has been a habit of winter afforestation for many years. Northern China has a cold and dry climate, and winter afforestation is not as favorable as in the south, and more attention should be paid to afforestation techniques. A brief explanation is given below from the two aspects of the seedling's own conditions and environmental conditions.

    Seedling Survival Conditions

    The key to determining the survival and death of seedlings is the consumption and absorption of water. When water consumption is greater than absorption, the seedlings gradually tend to dry out. The degree of dryness at which seedlings reach death varies depending on the tree species. According to observations, Masson pine is not greatly affected by survival when it loses 20% of its own water content. The survival rate of larch decreases significantly when it loses the same proportion of water. Masson pine is not greatly affected by survival when the loss of water reaches 10% of its own weight, and a large number of them die when it reaches 30%. Chinese fir is significantly affected by survival when the loss of water reaches more than 10% of its own weight. There are two ways for seedlings to lose water: one is physical evaporation, and the other is physiological transpiration. Seedling drying is the common result of these two types of water loss. The evaporation of water from the same seedling is mainly affected by external meteorological factors, among which the most important are temperature, humidity, sunshine, and wind. The transpiration of water from seedlings is not only related to meteorological factors, but is also governed by the physiological and anatomical state of the seedlings themselves. The organs for seedlings to carry out transpiration are mainly leaves. In winter, seedlings are in a dormant state, and the amount of water lost by deciduous trees due to transpiration is very small. For evergreen coniferous trees, the transpiration is greatly controlled in winter due to the increase in the content of sugars in the cell sap and the increase in concentration. The reduction in water loss from seedlings in winter is very beneficial to seedling survival, but this does not mean that the seedling's water is not consumed at all. On the one hand, water is lost through evaporation, and on the other hand, weak transpiration is also taking place. After lifting and planting, the water absorption of seedlings is greatly restricted or even completely cut off due to the low soil temperature. Therefore, the water condition of seedlings themselves in winter is not entirely in a favorable state. If sufficient attention is not paid, it is very easy to cause the seedlings to dry out and die.

    The most important way for seedlings to absorb water is through the roots, and the fine roots have the greatest water absorption capacity. These roots are easily damaged during lifting. After the seedlings are planted, if they have a strong ability to take root and produce roots before the stems and leaves consume a large amount of water, it is an important condition for seedling survival. Under normal conditions, root growth generally starts earlier than stem and leaf growth. According to observations, larch is about fifteen to twenty days earlier, and Masson pine is about one month earlier. In terms of rooting ability, roots grown in autumn have stronger regenerative power than roots grown in spring. It is easier to grow new roots when there are many autumn roots. Winter afforestation seedlings retain more autumn roots, and the roots can grow before the leaves in the second spring, which is extremely beneficial to seedling survival. At the same time, it must also be known that the roots, especially the fine roots, lose water faster than the stems and leaves due to the lack of protective tissue. In order to maintain the rooting ability of the roots, a certain amount of water must be preserved in the cell division tissue, otherwise the rooting function will be lost. Therefore, when lifting seedlings, it is necessary to pay full attention to preventing the roots of the seedlings from drying out, and also to prevent the roots from being exposed to the wind during planting.

    According to the experience of the masses in various places, it is best to lift and plant seedlings at the same time during winter afforestation, and at least do a good job of temporary planting and transportation of seedlings. In order to reduce the water loss from the above-ground parts, it is best to use the method of cutting off the stem for afforestation for broad-leaved trees with strong sprouting ability. For coniferous trees, Ji Linqing of Jixi County, Anhui Province, created the winter Chinese fir cutting method with deep insertion and solid burial, which is not only effective for Chinese fir, but also for winter cutting afforestation of poplars and willows. In addition, the use of one-year-old pine seedlings with soil clumps for planting is also a good method to protect the root system from drying out and improve the survival rate.

    Environmental Conditions for Seedling Survival

    The survival rate of seedlings after planting is greatly affected by water conditions, and the water conditions of seedlings are closely related to the local climate, soil, and other environmental conditions. In various parts of southern China, there is more rainfall in autumn and the winter is warm and humid, and there is more water stored in the soil, which is the best season for afforestation of the year. Even so, the weather conditions during afforestation still have a great impact on the afforestation survival rate. The afforestation survival rate is highest after rain or on cloudy, windless days. The local microclimate of the afforestation site in the same area also often affects the afforestation survival rate. Ji Linqing's experience in achieving great success in winter Chinese fir cutting is: it is best to insert Chinese fir after rain, and if it is cold and without rain, take the method of "collecting spikes on shady slopes and inserting them on sunny slopes." In northern China, although the climate is relatively cold, the seedlings themselves have a strong cold resistance in a dormant state and will not be frozen to death. The greatest threat is the dry and windy winter, which causes the seedlings to dry out. In order to prevent the seedlings from drying out, in addition to the above-mentioned methods of cutting off the stem and planting in clumps, the "pit-dike afforestation method" created by Baixiang County, Hebei Province, has been successful in afforestation in sandy wasteland. This method mainly involves piling up an arc-shaped small soil dike about fifteen centimeters high on the northwest side of the planting hole, inserting poplar strips on the north side of the hole, leaving ten centimeters above the ground, and filling the soil without filling the hole, forming a hole fifteen centimeters below the ground to prevent wind. This method can not only be used for sandy wasteland, but also can be used for other areas other than areas with poor drainage with slight changes.

    Another factor affecting the survival rate of winter afforestation is soil freezing. After the seedlings are planted, the soil is not easy to compact, and the seedling roots are exposed to the wind, causing the seedlings to dry out and die. Winter afforestation in the north is best carried out before the soil freezes solid. After the soil freezes solid, it can only be carried out on loose sandy soil, and the above-mentioned "pit-dike" afforestation method should be adopted, and the seedlings should be covered with grass to prevent cold after planting. Winter afforestation should not be carried out in places with excessive water content and heavy soil viscosity.

    The seedling's own conditions and environmental conditions that affect the survival of winter afforestation affect each other and interact with each other. One aspect cannot be paid attention to while ignoring the other. The application of advanced experience should also pay attention to the principle of adapting to the time and local conditions. In short, winter is a great season for afforestation. The broad masses have created many new technologies in many years of production practice. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, this year's winter afforestation will surely create more new technologies.

    冬季造林的成活条件
    中国林业科学院林业科学研究所研究员　侯治溥
    严冬也是造林的好季节
    我国广大农民的生产实践证明，一年四季都能造林。即使在严寒的冬季同样是造林的好季节。全国各地冬季造林成功的事例极多。广西玉林县六万林场在1957年12月下旬和1958年1月中旬造的马尾松林，成活率都在90％左右；湖南会同县疏溪公社1954年12月中旬栽的杉木林，1958年调查成活率达到98％，幼树高达八尺；湖南省慈利林场1953年冬季栽植的大片杜仲林，1958年调查成活率为98％，幼树高达一丈以上；安徽省绩溪县全国林业劳动模范纪林庆在1953年到1955年连续进行的四季插杉的试验，冬季插的成活率达到85％—95％；河北省柏乡县1954年和1955年冬季在沙荒造杨树林，成活率达到90％。这些例子说明：无论是在我国的南方或北方，不管是针叶树种还是阔叶树种，冬季造林都收到了良好的成绩。湖南省会同县西楼公社从实践中总结出冬季造林有三大好处：一、冬季农事较轻，便于安排劳动力；二、冬季树苗处在休眠状态，移植时苗木不易受伤，栽后第二年春季苗木先扎根后出叶容易成活；三、冬季造林有利于在林间间种杂粮，非但可以避免因播种杂粮影响幼林生长，而且可以收到林粮相长之效。
    冬季（其他季节也一样）造林，要想得到成活率高、树苗生长健壮，就必须根据树苗本身生理活动和造林地环境条件的特点，采用因时因地制宜的造林技术。冬季造林就苗木的成活来说，有很多有利条件，也有不利条件。我国南方气候温暖湿润，冬季造林的有利因素更多一些，历年来也有冬季造林的习惯。我国北方气候寒冷干燥，冬季造林不如南方有利，应更多注意造林技术。现就苗木本身条件和环境条件两方面加以简略的说明。
    苗木成活的本身条件
    支配苗木成活和死亡的关键是水分的消耗和吸收。水分的消耗大于吸收时，苗木便逐渐趋于干燥。苗木达到死亡的干燥程度因树种而异。据观察，油松当失去其本身含水量的20％的水分时，对成活无大影响。落叶松当失去同样比例的水分时，成活率就显著降低。马尾松当水分消失达到本身重量的10％时，对成活影响不大，达到30％时就大量死亡。杉木在消失水分达到本身重量的10％以上时，成活就受到显著的影响。苗木水分的消失有两个途径：一是物理的蒸发作用，另一个是生理的蒸腾作用。苗木的干燥是这两种水分消失的共同结果。同一株苗木的水分蒸发主要受外界气象因子的影响，其中最主要的是温度、湿度、日照和风的影响。苗木的水分蒸腾，除与气象因子有关外，同时也受苗木本身生理的和解剖的状态所支配。苗木进行蒸腾作用的器官，主要是树叶，冬季苗木在休眠状态下，落叶树由蒸腾作用而消失的水分数量很少，常绿的针叶树冬季因细胞液中糖分的含量增加，浓度变高，蒸腾作用受到很大的控制。冬季树苗水分消失的减少，对苗木成活十分有利，但这并不等于苗木的水分完全没有消耗。一方面由蒸发作用失去水分，另一方面微弱的蒸腾作用也在进行。在起苗和栽植后，因土壤温度低，苗木的吸水受到极大限制，甚至于完全断绝，因此，冬季苗木本身的水分状况也并非完全处在有利状态。如果不加以充分注意，极容易造成苗木的干燥死亡。
    苗木吸收水的最主要的道路是根，吸水能力最大的是细根，这种根在起苗时很容易受到损伤。苗木栽后，如有旺盛的生根的能力，并在叶茎大量消耗水分以前生出根来，是苗木成活的重要条件。一般在正常条件下，根的生长比茎叶开始得早。据观察，落叶松约早十五到二十天，油松约早一个月光景。就生根能力来说，在秋季生的根比春天生的根再生力强，秋根多时容易发新根。冬季造林苗木保存的秋根多，第二年春季根能先叶生长，因此对苗木的成活极为有利。同时也必须知道，根部尤其是细根因为缺乏保护组织，水分消失比茎叶都快，在保持根的发根能力上，必须在细胞分裂组织中保存一定的水分，否则便会失去生根的机能。因此，起苗时，必须充分注意防止苗木根系的干燥，栽植时也要防止根部透风。
    根据各地群众经验，在冬季造林时，最好是随起苗随栽植，至少也要作好苗木的假植和运输。为了减少地上部的水分消失，对萌芽力强的阔叶树最好是采用截干造林的方法。对针叶树，安徽省绩溪县纪林庆创造的大穗深插实埋冬季插杉法，不仅对杉木有效，对杨柳类冬季插条造林也同样有效。另外，利用一年生松苗带土丛植，也是保护根系免于干燥、提高成活率的好方法。
    苗木成活的环境条件
    苗木栽植后的成活率在极大程度上受水分条件的影响，而苗木的水分条件又与当地的气候土壤等环境条件有密切关系。在我国南方各地，秋季雨水较多，冬季温暖湿润，土壤中保存的水分也较多，是一年之中造林最好的季节。尽管如此，造林时的天气状况对造林成活率仍有极大影响。雨后或阴天无风的天气，造林成活率最高。同一地区造林地的局部小气候也常影响到造林的成活率。纪林庆冬季插杉获得很大成功的经验是：最好在雨后插杉，如果天冷无雨，则采取“阴坡采穗阳坡插”的办法。在我国北部，气候虽较寒冷，但由于苗木本身在休眠状态下抗寒能力较强，并不会冻死。威胁最大的是冬季干燥风大，引起苗木干燥。为了防止苗木干燥，除可采用上述截干丛植等法外，河北省柏乡县创造的“坑埝式造林法”，在沙荒地造林获得成功。这种方法主要是在栽植穴的西北面用土堆成高约十五厘米的弧形小土埝，在穴的北面插杨树条地上留十厘米，填土不填满穴，形成低于地表十五厘米的穴以防风。这种方法不仅可用于沙荒地，稍加变动，也可以用于排水不良地区以外的其他地区。
    另一影响冬季造林成活率的是土壤冻结，苗木栽后土不容易踏实，苗木根部透风引起苗木干燥致死。北方冬季造林最好在土壤冻实以前进行，土壤冻实以后只能在松散的沙质土壤上进行，并采用上述“坑埝式”的造林法，栽后并复草防寒。冬季造林不宜在水分过多土壤粘性重的地方进行。
    影响冬季造林成活的苗木本身条件和环境条件是互相影响互为作用的，不能只注意一面而忽略另一面。先进经验的运用，也应注意因时因地制宜的原则。总之，冬季是造林的大好季节。广大群众在多年生产实践中创造出不少新技术。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，今年的冬季造林一定会创造出更多的新技术。
