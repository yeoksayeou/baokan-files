Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 7th. Czechoslovak animal husbandry is continuously developing, and the number of livestock and poultry is increasing daily.

　　In the first nine months of this year, the country raised more than six million pigs, an increase of more than 430,000 compared with the same period last year. The number of cattle increased by 2.4% compared with the same period last year. Poultry has also increased significantly this year. The number of hens in the first half of this year increased by 13.6% compared with the same period last year. Currently, the national average is one pig for every two people, one cow for every three people, and four poultry for every person.

　　In order to promote the development of animal husbandry, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government have taken a series of measures. For example, the state appropriately reduced the amount of grain purchased, leaving more feed for the cooperatives. The government also decided that from January next year, the selling price of live livestock will be increased by about one-third. In order to accelerate the breeding of livestock, 62% of the small livestock were kept for feeding this year, while only 58% were kept last year.

　　The application of scientific feeding methods and mechanization in animal husbandry is also one of the important reasons for the rapid development of animal husbandry. The livestock cooperative in Krumlov County, České Budějovice State, has adopted a new electric fence grazing method, which is to use electric fences with mild currents to enclose livestock in the grassland for grazing during a certain season, so that the livestock can breathe fresh air and graze freely. As a result, the livestock gained an average of 0.68 kilograms of meat per day, and some even reached one kilogram. At present, many state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives across the country are adopting this new feeding method. Automatic pig feeding methods have also been widely used in rural areas.

　　These advanced methods not only make livestock grow faster, but also greatly save labor. In farms or cooperatives without automation equipment, one breeder can only take care of 150 pigs, while in places with automation equipment, they can take care of 350 pigs, while also avoiding the waste of feed.

　　With the development of animal husbandry, farmers have also provided more livestock products to the country. In the first eleven months of this year, the total amount of meat purchased nationwide increased by more than 3% compared with the same period last year. The Czech region has completed its poultry purchase task two months ahead of schedule. State-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives handed over 12,000 tons of chickens and ducks to the state. This figure is the highest record of poultry purchases in Czechoslovakia after the war, an increase of 40% compared with the same period last year. The purchase volume of milk and eggs has also increased significantly compared with last year.

### 党和政府采取措施大力发展畜牧业  捷家畜和家禽头数日益增多  平均每二人有一头猪　三人有一头牛　一人有四只家禽

    党和政府采取措施大力发展畜牧业
    捷家畜和家禽头数日益增多
    平均每二人有一头猪　三人有一头牛　一人有四只家禽
    新华社布拉格7日电　捷克斯洛伐克畜牧业不断发展，牲畜和家禽的头数正在日益增多。
    在今年头九个月中，全国共养猪六百多万头，比去年同期增加了四十三万多头，牛的头数比去年同期增加了2.4％。家禽也比去年增长很多，其中母鸡在今年上半年就比去年同期增加了13.6％。目前，全国平均每二人就有一头猪，每三人有一头牛，每一人有四只家禽。
    为了促进畜牧业的发展，捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府曾采取了一系列的措施。如国家适当减少了粮食的征购数量，给合作社留下更多的饲料。政府并决定自明年1月起，将活牲畜的出售价格提高约三分之一。为了加速牲畜的繁殖，今年有62％的小牲畜留下饲养，而去年留下的只有58％。
    科学的饲养方法和机械化在畜牧业方面的采用，也是畜牧业获得迅速发展的重要原因之一。契斯克—布德约维泽州的克鲁姆洛夫县的畜牧合作社由于采用了一种新的电栏放牧方法，就是在一定季节用轻度电流的电栏围在草地上放牧牲畜，使牲畜可以呼吸新鲜空气，自由吃草。结果，牲畜平均每日长肉零点六八公斤，有的甚至达到一公斤。目前全国有许多国营农场和农业合作社都在采取这种新的饲养方法。农村中还普遍采用了自动化喂猪的方法。
    这些先进的方法不仅使牲畜成长得更快，而且大大节约了劳动力。在没有自动化设备的农场或合作社，一个饲养员只能照管一百五十头猪，而有自动化设备的地方，可以照管三百五十头，同时还避免了饲料的浪费。
    随着畜牧业的发展，农民们为国家提供的畜产品也相应增多，在今年头十一个月中，全国肉类的收购总量比去年同期提高了3％以上。捷克地区的家禽收购任务已提前两个月完成。国营农场和农业生产合作社缴给国家一万二千吨鸡、鸭，这个数字是战后捷克斯洛伐克家禽收购的最高纪录，比去年同期增长了40％。牛奶和鸡蛋收购量也比去年有很大增加。
