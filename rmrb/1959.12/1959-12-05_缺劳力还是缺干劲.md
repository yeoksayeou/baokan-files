Title: Lack of Labor or Lack of Enthusiasm?

Lack of labor and lack of enthusiasm are both relative to production requirements.

For example, if a production team has one laborer cultivating an average of fifty mu of land, that would be considered tight labor, a labor shortage, right? However, if the requirement is only a few dozen jin per mu, and they just scatter the seeds and let things be, managing it if they can, and ignoring it if they can't, then there's no way they'll lack labor. If the requirement is several hundred jin per mu, requiring water conservancy, garden-style cultivation, more fertilizer, and more processing, then labor will definitely be in dire shortage.

We are engaged in the Great Leap Forward, and it's not surprising that we feel a lack of labor when we demand high-speed development of production. Engaging in the Great Leap Forward requires mental preparation for a "lack of labor." The Great Leap Forward in production requires a Great Leap Forward in enthusiasm (not only hard work, but also clever work, and also a Great Leap Forward in agricultural technology). If enthusiasm doesn't leap forward, and you still expect a Great Leap Forward in production, still relying on that same group of people, still relying on the original enthusiasm, then there will definitely be a labor shortage.

Someone asked: "Is it a lack of labor or a lack of enthusiasm?" I think the question is good, the question is reasonable. Think carefully, asking for labor versus boosting enthusiasm ourselves is also a dividing line between us and right-leaning thought. In the eyes of right-leaning conservatives, the Great Leap Forward is the same thing as increasing labor. The Great Leap Forward must massively increase labor. As much as you leap forward, that's how much you increase labor. Of course, no one gives you labor, so they shout about a lack of labor every day, and production, of course, never leaps forward. In our view, the Great Leap Forward and boosting enthusiasm are the same thing. The Great Leap Forward must greatly boost enthusiasm. As much as you leap forward, that's how much enthusiasm you boost, only bigger, never smaller. In this way, even though labor may sometimes be relatively tight, production can still leap forward.

Of course, if there is a labor shortage, we must rely on technological innovation. Brute force alone won't work. However, technological innovation first requires enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm, technological innovation is just a flower in a mirror, the moon in the water, just talk.

### 缺劳力还是缺干劲

    缺劳力还是缺干劲
    河北交河　徐家常
    缺劳力和缺干劲，都是按生产要求说的。
    比如某生产队一个劳动力平均耕作五十亩地，这算劳力紧、劳力缺了吧。但是，如果要求亩产几十斤，撒上种子就了事，能管就管，管不过来就不管。这样，劳动力是缺不了的。如果要求亩产几百斤，需要水利化、园田化，多施肥，多加工。这样，劳力一定缺的够呛。
    我们搞大跃进，要求生产高速度发展，感到缺劳力这并不奇怪。搞大跃进就要有“缺劳力”的思想准备。生产大跃进，要求干劲大跃进（不仅苦干，还要巧干，还要农业技术的大跃进）。干劲不跃进，还想生产大跃进，还凭那班子人手，还凭原来的干劲，一定会缺劳力。
    有人问：“缺劳力还是缺干劲？”我觉得问得好，问得有理。仔细想想吧，伸手要劳力和本身鼓干劲，这也是我们和右倾思想的一条分界线，右倾保守者看来，大跃进跟增劳力是一码事，大跃进必须大增劳力，跃进多少就增多少劳力，当然，劳力是没人给的，因此，他们天天喊缺劳力，而生产呢，老是跃不上去。在我们看来，大跃进和鼓干劲倒是一码事，大跃进必须大鼓干劲，跃进多少鼓多大劲，只大不能小，这样，虽然有时劳力也会比较紧，生产也能跃进。
    当然，劳力不足，就得靠技术革新，蛮干也不行。可是，技术革新首先就得靠干劲。没有干劲，技术革新就是镜中花，水中月，说说罢了。
