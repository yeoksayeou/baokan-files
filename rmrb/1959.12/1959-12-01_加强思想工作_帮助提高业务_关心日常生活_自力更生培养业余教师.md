    Self-Reliantly Cultivate Spare-Time Teachers
    Qingdao Building Materials Company Solves Major Problems in Employee Education
    (Our report) The Qingdao Municipal Local Building Materials Company of Shandong Province has achieved great success in cultivating and improving teachers in consolidating and developing employee spare-time education. In the past few years, the company's leadership, based on the principle of "using local resources and those who are capable as teachers," and adopting the method of "teaching, learning, and improving simultaneously," has rapidly expanded the teaching staff (from 13 to the current 58). The political and ideological awareness and professional level of the teachers have also greatly improved, ensuring the continuous development of employee education.
    From the beginning of running the school, the company's Party committee adopted the method of self-reliance to solve the problem of teachers. On the one hand, they hired 30 part-time teachers from section cadres and workers. At the same time, they selected and trained 20 teachers from various fields, plus the original 8 full-time teachers, which basically met the teaching needs in terms of quantity. However, some of the hired part-time teachers were afraid that they could not teach due to their low level of education, while others were afraid that they would not have time to teach due to their busy work, so they lacked confidence and motivation. Some of the newly selected teachers also believed that teaching had no future, held temporary views, and copied the lesson plans mechanically, resulting in poor teaching results. In response to this situation, the company's Party committee vigorously strengthened the political and ideological work among the teachers. First, they organized new teachers and section cadres to participate in the study of political theory and current affairs policies, and separately formed groups to study the Party's education policy and relevant documents on running schools in factories. In order to urge them to study, the Party committee also frequently conducted tests. Secondly, they organized new teachers to participate in labor training, assigning them to various work sections and types of work to participate in certain labor. Through labor, many teachers established relatively deep feelings with the workers and enriched their production knowledge. Usually, the Party committee also frequently cared about the ideological work of the teachers. Through individual talks, holding symposiums, writing letters of condolences, checking personal plans, and evaluating and awarding prizes, they solved many ideological problems for them and greatly inspired their enthusiasm for work.
    In terms of improving the professional level of teachers, the company's leadership adopted various forms: First, high-level teachers take apprentices. Initially, new teachers were assigned to classes taught by teachers with higher professional levels as counselors, so that they could first understand the general process and teaching methods of teaching. Then, specific personnel were assigned to take charge and lead them, from preparing lessons to correcting homework, from classroom lectures to extracurricular tutoring, to help them specifically until the new teachers could independently take on teaching work. Second, hold professional lectures. Teachers with strong professional abilities and rich teaching experience are selected as lecturers to determine the content of the lectures according to the actual needs of teaching work. For example, they have successively and systematically explained issues such as "Language Teaching Method" and "Arithmetic Teaching Method." At the beginning of this semester, some teachers reflected that they did not know how to make teaching plans, so they took "How to Formulate Teaching Plans for Various Subjects" as the theme of the lecture. Third, teach each other and learn from each other, and exchange experiences. Since last year, five on-site meetings have been held to exchange experiences in "literacy work," "language and arithmetic teaching reform," and so on, to learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and to continuously improve. Fourth, conduct spare-time training and centralized training. Spare-time training is based on grassroots branch schools, extracting two to four hours a day within a few weeks to focus on solving several major problems in teaching. Centralized training is carried out during the holidays for about a month. In a centralized training in the winter of 1958, teachers were organized to study the Party's education policy, exchange experiences, carry out special sounding-board debates, review and criticize some incorrect ideas about employee education, and finally wrote personal ideological self-criticism summaries. Teachers generally reported that they gained a lot.
    The company's leadership also attaches great importance to improving teachers' cultural level, and organizes teachers to participate in factory-external teacher training colleges, teacher training schools, and spare-time university studies. Every week, they are guaranteed four to eight hours of school study time and two hours of self-study time. For part-time teachers, the method of supplementing what is lacking is adopted, and teachers with higher education levels provide assistance, generally studying for four hours a week. Through cultural advancement and professional learning, the cultural level and professional ability of teachers have been greatly improved. Originally, most teachers could only teach literacy classes, but now 65% of them can teach senior primary school courses, and 35% of them can teach junior high school courses.
    The company's Party committee also cares very much about the lives of teachers and creates favorable working conditions for teachers. The leadership often adopts the method of home visits to understand the family situation of teachers, ask about their well-being, and promptly help solve problems when they are discovered. This makes teachers deeply moved and more motivated.

    加强思想工作　帮助提高业务　关心日常生活
    自力更生培养业余教师
    青岛建筑材料公司解决职工教育中的大问题
    本报讯　山东省青岛市地方建筑材料公司在巩固和发展职工业余教育中，在培养提高师资方面取得很大成就。几年来，这个公司的领导上根据“就地取材，能者为师”的原则，采取“边教、边学、边提高”的方法，使教师的队伍迅速扩大（由十三人增加到现在的五十八人），教师的政治思想与业务水平也有很大提高，保证了职工教育的不断发展。
    从办学开始，公司党委就采取自力更生的办法，来解决师资问题。他们一方面从科室干部和工人中聘请兼课教师三十名，同时从各方面选拔培训教师二十名，加上原有专职教师八名，在数量上基本上适应了教学需要。但聘请的兼课教师，有的怕文化低教不了，有的怕业务忙没空教，信心不大，劲头不足。新选拔的教师，有些也认为教学没前途，抱有临时观点，备课生搬硬套，教学效果不好。针对这一情况，公司党委便大力加强了教师中的政治思想工作。首先组织新教师与科室干部一起参加学习政治理论、时事政策，并且单独编组学习党的教育方针以及工厂办学等有关文件。为了督促他们学习，党委还经常进行测验。其次，组织新教师参加劳动锻炼，将他们分配到各工段、工种跟班参加一定的劳动。不少教师通过劳动，和工人建立了比较深厚的感情，丰富了生产知识。平时，党委也经常关心教师的思想工作。通过个别谈心、开座谈会、写信慰问、检查个人规划、评选奖励等形式，解决了他们很多思想问题，大大启发了他们工作中的积极性。
    在提高教师业务水平方面，公司领导上采取了多种形式：一、由水平高的教师带徒弟。起初将新教师分配在业务水平较高的教师任课的班里当辅导员，使他们先了解教学的一般过程和教学方法，然后责成专人分工包干带领，从备课到批改作业，从课堂讲解到课外辅导，具体进行帮助，直到新教师能独自胜任教学工作为止。二、举办业务讲座。选择业务能力较强、教学经验丰富的教师担任讲师，根据教学工作的实际需要，确定讲座内容。如他们曾先后系统地讲解了“语文教学法”、“算术教学法”等问题。这学期开始，有些教师反映不会订教学计划，便以“如何制订各科教学计划”为题，作为讲座内容。三、互教互学，交流经验。去年以来曾开过五次现场会议，交流“扫盲工作”、“语文、算术教学改革”等方面的经验，互相取长补短，不断提高。四、进行业余训练与集中训练。业余训练是以基层分校为单位，在几周时间内，每天抽出二至四小时，集中解决教学中的某几个主要问题。集中训练，是在假期中以一个月左右的时间进行。在1958年冬一次集训中，组织教师学习了党的教育方针，交流了经验，开展了专题鸣放辩论，检查批判了对待职工教育的一些不正确思想，最后写出了个人思想检查总结，教师普遍反映收获很大。
    这个公司的领导上也十分重视提高教师的文化水平，组织教师分别参加厂外教师进修学院、教师进修学校、业余大学学习。每周保证使他们有四至八小时的在校学习时间、两小时的自学时间。对兼课教师，则采取缺什么补什么的办法，由文化程度高的教师进行帮助，每周一般学习四小时。通过文化进修和业务学习，教师文化水平、业务能力已有很大提高。原先大多数教师只能教扫盲班，现在已有65％的人能教高小课程，35％的人能教初中课程。
    公司党委还非常关心教师生活，给教师创造有利的工作条件。领导上经常采取家庭访问的办法，了解教师家庭情况，问寒问暖，发现问题，及时帮助解决。这使教师深受感动，干劲更大。
