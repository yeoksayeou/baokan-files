    On Timeliness
    Jing Yu

    On our road forward, new problems constantly emerge. The task of leadership is to promptly discover and grasp these problems, analyze and study them, find solutions, and resolve them in a timely manner.

    Timeliness matters a great deal. If leadership work is timely and accompanied by various proactive and concrete measures, then the various production indicators of the enterprise will rise steadily and continuously. Conversely, if leadership work is slow and insensitive, failing to discover problems in time, or failing to take decisive measures even after discovering them, then even if all the original indicators were completed very well, the work may stagnate due to the leader's failure to address new problems in the work in a timely manner, and even the original achievements may not be maintained.

      The issue of "timeliness" is also the issue of seizing the initiative. Resolving problems in a timely manner makes the work proactive; failing to resolve problems in a timely manner, or waiting until problems pile up before resolving them, makes the work passive. There are many examples of this in actual work. For example, Xiangtan Electric Wire Factory is a typical example of correcting shortcomings in a timely manner and taking the initiative. In the first quarter of this year, the factory's production tasks were completed excellently, but in the second quarter, several safety accidents occurred, and product quality began to decline. The factory party committee promptly discovered this situation, immediately analyzed the causes, and through mass debate among employees, established the idea of ​​a double leap forward in output and quality and emphasizing safety. In about ten days, they found more than 2,000 hidden dangers in electrical appliances, equipment, operations, and materials, and cleared most of the hidden dangers within a month. At the same time, the factory also improved the strict safety responsibility system and quality inspection system, which rapidly increased product quality and greatly reduced safety accidents, thereby achieving a comprehensive leap forward. Facts show that encountering problems, difficulties, or shortcomings of one kind or another on the road forward is not a terrible thing. As long as the enterprise's leaders discover problems in a timely manner and resolve them promptly, they can handle everything smoothly and take the initiative everywhere. For certain matters that were not grasped tightly enough for a while and went wrong, if corrected in time, they can also quickly get rid of passivity and turn to initiative.

    The above discusses the relationship between timeliness and initiative; however, this does not mean that grasping problems in work in a timely manner is equal to seizing the initiative. To truly take the initiative, it is also necessary to see whether the grasp is comprehensive. A comprehensive leap forward in enterprise production includes high output, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, safety, and other aspects. If one aspect is grasped and another is lost, or if the secondary aspects are grasped and the main aspects are lost; if high output is grasped and high quality is lost, or if high quality is grasped and high output is ignored. On the surface, it seems that things have been grasped in a timely manner, but in terms of actual results, it may not necessarily be possible to take the initiative.

    If we grasp things in a timely manner and comprehensively, we can proactively eliminate problems in the bud, prevent problems from piling up and hindering our progress, thereby ensuring that our production and construction are always in a vigorous development situation. This is the correct working method and leadership method we want to promote.

    谈及时
    静宇
    在我们前进的道路上，常常会出现这样那样的新问题。领导的任务是：及时发现和抓住这些问题，加以分析研究，找出解决办法，把问题及时地解决。
    及时不及时，关系很大。领导工作抓得及时，并且有各种积极的具体的措施，那末，企业生产的各项指标就会稳定地持续地上升。相反，如果领导工作目光迟钝，慢慢吞吞，没有及时发现问题，发现了也没有采取断然的措施，那末，即使原来各项指标都完成得很好，由于领导者对工作中出现的新问题抓得不及时，工作就可能停滞不前了，甚至原有的成就也可能保不住了。
      “及时”的问题，也就是争取主动的问题。及时解决问题，工作就主动了；不及时解决问题，或者等到问题成堆再去解决，工作就被动了。实际工作中这一类的事例很多。例如湘潭电线厂就是及时改正缺点、取得主动的一个典型。今年第一季度，这个厂的生产任务完成得很出色，可是在第二季度发生了几件安全事故，产品质量开始下降。厂党委及时发现这一情况，立即分析原因，通过职工群众大辩论，树立了产量、质量双跃进和重视安全的思想，十天左右，查出了电器、设备、操作、材料等方面的隐患二千多处，一个月内，就把绝大部分隐患清除了；同时，工厂又健全了严格的安全责任制和质量检验制度，使产品质量迅速上升，安全事故大大减少，从而实现了全面跃进。事实表明：在前进的道路上，遇到这样那样的问题、这样那样的困难或者这样那样的缺点，并不是什么可怕的事情。只要企业的领导人员及时发现问题，及时予以解决，就能事事顺手、处处主动。对于某些暂时抓得不紧而出了毛病的事情，如果纠正及时，也可以很快摆脱被动，转入主动。
    上面说的是及时和主动的关系；但是，这并不是意味着及时抓工作中的问题，就等于抓住主动了。要真正取得主动，还要看抓得全面不全面。企业生产上的全面跃进，包括高产、优质、多品种、低成本、安全等方面。如果抓住了一面，丢掉了另一面，或者抓住了次要方面，丢掉了主要方面；抓住了高产，丢掉了优质，或者抓住了优质，忽视了高产。从表面上看，好像也及时抓了，然而，从实际效果看，就不一定能取得主动。
    既要抓得及时，又要抓得全面，就能主动地把问题消灭在萌芽状态，不让问题成堆，障碍我们前进，从而使我们的生产建设永远处在一个蓬蓬勃勃的发展局面中。这就是我们要提倡的一种正确的工作方法和领导方法。
