Xinhua News Agency, Sofia Telegram: The initiative to learn from the communist virtues of Soviet textile worker and Communist Party member Gaganova has rapidly gained widespread response among Bulgarian workers. Inspired by Gaganova's brilliant example, many advanced producers in Bulgarian industrial and mining enterprises have begun to transfer to backward production teams to work.

To exchange and widely adopt the experience of Gaganova's initiative, a meeting of activists from the Sofia capital party, trade union, Communist Youth League, and economic departments was held in Sofia not long ago.

The first Bulgarians to learn from Gaganova were Sofia's outstanding train drivers Zlatarev, Zashkov, Panchev, and others. Last November, they left their good locomotives to work on old locomotives that needed repair. Thanks to their good care of the locomotives, the ten old locomotives that consumed a lot of coal last year saved 1,682 tons of coal in the first ten months of this year, overfulfilled the transportation of 1,114,295 tons of goods, and increased profits by 381,000 leva (Bulgarian currency) more than planned.

Currently, twenty drivers from the Sofia Locomotive Factory and many drivers from all over the country have responded to this initiative.

In the construction industry, Gaganova's initiative is mainly being promoted on construction sites that need to be completed quickly. Now, in the Third Construction Zone of Sofia, seventeen work teams have implemented Gaganova's initiative.

Workers in many other industrial enterprises have also joined the ranks of adopting Gaganova's initiative. After Ilyev, an outstanding worker at the "Bulgaria" Textile Factory, transferred to a group that could only complete 95% of its plan in the past, the group's work now completes 104% of its plan every month.

Gaganova's initiative has also been promoted on the commercial front. Slavov, an advanced worker at the Sofia Central Department Store, volunteered to work in the backward "Glassware" department. Because he was good at uniting the masses, improving organizational work, and launching competitions between classes, the "Glassware" department completed 121% of its commodity turnover plan in the third quarter of this year, earning 139,000 leva more profit than planned.

The Gaganova initiative is being implemented in the coal mines of Dimitrovgrad, the textile enterprises of Plovdiv, and many industrial units, construction departments, transportation, and commercial sectors throughout Bulgaria.

    广大职工发扬共产主义风格
    先进帮助落后共同前进
    新华社索非亚电　学习苏联纺织女工、共产党员加干诺娃的共产主义品德的倡议，已经在保加利亚工人中迅速地得到广泛响应。在加干诺娃的光辉榜样的鼓舞下，保加利亚许多工矿企业的先进生产者已经开始转到落后生产队去工作。
    为了交流和广泛采用加干诺娃倡议的经验，不久前在索非亚举行了首都党、工会、共青团和经济部门的积极分子会议。
    保加利亚第一批学习加干诺娃的是索非亚的优秀火车司机兹拉塔雷夫、扎什科夫、潘切夫等。他们在去年11月，离开自己的好机车，到旧的、需要修理的机车上去工作。由于他们很好地护养机车，使去年多耗费了许多煤的十辆旧机车在今年十个月中节约了一千六百八十二吨煤，并超计划运输了一百一十一万四千二百九十五吨货物，增加的利润比原计划多三十八万一千列弗（保币）。
    目前，索非亚机车厂的二十个司机和全国各地的许多司机都响应了这一倡议。
    在建筑业中，加干诺娃的倡议主要是在需要很快完工的工地上推广的。现在，在索非亚第三建筑区，已经有十七个工作队实行了加干诺娃的倡议。
    许多其他工业企业的工人也都参加了采用加干诺娃倡议的行列。“保加利亚”纺织厂优秀工作者伊利耶夫转到过去只能完成计划95％的小组去以后，这个小组的工作现在每月能完成计划104％。
    在商业战线上也推广了加干诺娃的倡议。索非亚中央百货公司先进工作者斯拉沃夫自愿到落后的“玻璃器皿”部去工作。他由于善于团结群众，改进组织工作，并且发动了各班之间的竞赛。因此，“玻璃器皿”部今年第三季度的商品周转计划完成了121％，超过计划多赢得了十三万九千列弗的利润。
    保加利亚煤炭工业中心——季米特洛夫城的矿井、普罗夫迪夫城的纺织企业以及保加利亚许多工业单位、建筑部门、运输和商业部门都正在实行加干诺娃的倡议。
