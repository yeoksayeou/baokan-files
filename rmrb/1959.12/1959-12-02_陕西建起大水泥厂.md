A large cement plant built in Shaanxi
    Shaanxi Province's first modern cement plant—the Yaoxian Cement Plant—has been completed and, at the end of last month, trial-produced its first batch of high-grade cement.
    This cement plant mainly produces No. 500 silicate cement and is one of the large, modern cement plants in our country. Its complete set of equipment was manufactured in the German Democratic Republic.
