This dispatch from Guangzhou on the 28th reports: The Zhangshi People's Commune in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, on the basis of achieving high-speed development in diversified operations this year, recently formulated a production plan for continuing to leap forward by doubling diversified operations next year, and adopted a series of measures to ensure the realization of this production plan.

This year, the Zhangshi Commune implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link and simultaneously developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, as well as simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production. The total income from diversified operations (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, and processing industries) for the whole year has reached more than 3.9 million yuan. Among the total income of diversified operations of the commune this year, the income from twelve comprehensive enterprises for developing mountainous resources run by the commune accounted for 2.8 million yuan, which is 600,000 yuan more than the total income of diversified operations of the entire commune last year. The income from diversified operations at both the brigade and team levels has also increased more than threefold compared with the total income of 330,000 yuan from diversified operations of various advanced cooperatives before communization in 1957. Among the total income of diversified operations of the commune, 80% is income from commodity production. The development of diversified operations has strongly supported the development of agricultural production in terms of funds, production tools, and fertilizers. This year, the total grain output of the commune reached 32.5 million catties, an increase of 30% over last year. Commodity grain was 12.3 million catties, an increase of 70% over last year.

After summing up the experience of this year's overall Great Leap Forward, the Zhangshi Commune recently formulated a production plan for continuing the overall Great Leap Forward next year with foresight and in a realistic and practical manner. According to this plan, the total income from diversified operations of the commune next year will reach 8 million yuan, an increase of onefold compared to this year. In terms of animal husbandry, the emphasis is on developing pig raising as the center, developing from the current 8,000 head of live pigs to 25,000 head (including 5,000 head privately raised by commune members, i.e., one head privately raised per household); the production of chickens, ducks, and geese will increase from the current stock of more than 137,000 to 400,000. In terms of freshwater aquaculture, the production will increase from 300,000 catties this year to 1 million catties. The production of charcoal and mangosteen, which generate substantial income, will be further developed next year according to the needs of the country. In addition, the acreage of economic crops such as sugarcane, rapeseed, cotton, soybeans, and red melon seeds will be expanded by 9,000 mu next year, among which 9,000 mu of rapeseed harvested in the spring (an increase of 6,000 mu compared to rapeseed harvested in the spring this year) is growing vigorously and beginning to bloom.

The Zhangshi Commune analyzed the favorable conditions for realizing the production plan of diversified operations next year and adopted specific measures to ensure the realization of this plan. After a year of efforts this year, the commune has sufficient production funds and has laid a good foundation for continuing the leap forward in technology. The twelve enterprises affiliated to the commune that develop mountainous resources have transitioned from indigenous production to semi-indigenous and semi-foreign production, and from manual operation to semi-mechanization. This year, two cars, seven tractors, and four electric boats have been purchased, and more than 130 li of highways have been opened in the mountains. Currently, 700 laborers are still being invested to continue opening mountain roads. The commune has 300 livestock and poultry farms and more than 800 mu of feed bases, and the prepared refined and coarse feed is sufficient for the needs of developing pig raising next year. At the same time, the commune now has 1,400 sows, and the commune itself can solve the piglet needs for next year. In addition, the seeds and chemical fertilizers required for expanding the planting of various economic crops next year have been fully prepared.

The Zhangshi Commune has fully considered the difficulties of labor shortage that will be encountered in the continued leap forward of agriculture and diversified operations next year. Next year, the commune plans to expand the planting of rice by more than 10,000 mu and the planting of economic crops by 9,000 mu. Recently, more than 300 laborers have been transferred to support national industrial construction, which has created a contradiction between the greatly increased workload and the relatively reduced labor force next year. In view of the fact that transportation consumes the largest amount of labor in the commune, the commune is currently focusing on tool reform, preparing to increase 3,000 ox carts and handcarts. The addition of this batch of transportation tools, coupled with the more than 600 cattle added to the commune this year, is equivalent to adding several thousand strong laborers. In view of the fact that the commune spends a lot of labor on burning lime every year (more than 200,000 workdays were used this year), after the autumn harvest this year, the production teams have advanced the deployment of a large number of laborers to burn lime. So far, the commune has produced 7.1 million catties of lime. It is estimated that before the start of spring plowing, all the lime needed for the whole year of next year can be completed, saving a large number of laborers for agricultural and sideline production next year. Judging from the current measures and actions, as long as we give play to the soaring energy and carry out practical and skillful work, the difficulty of labor shortage can be solved.

### 进一步贯彻以粮食为主农林牧副渔同时并举的方针  樟市公社规划明年多种经营

　　进一步贯彻以粮食为主农林牧副渔同时并举的方针
    樟市公社规划明年多种经营
    本报广州28日电　广东省韶关市郊区樟市人民公社在取得今年多种经营高速度发展的基础上，最近制订了明年多种经营继续跃进一倍的生产规划，并采取一系列保证这个生产计划实现的措施。
    樟市公社今年贯彻了以粮食为主和农林牧副渔同时并举、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，全年多种经营（包括林、牧、副、渔和加工工业）总收入已达三百九十万元以上。今年全社多种经营总收入中，十二项综合性开发山区资源的社办企业收入占二百八十万元，比去年全社多种经营收入的总和还多六十万元，大队、小队两级的多种经营收入也比公社化前的1957年各高级社的多种经营总收入三十三万元增加两倍多。全社多种经营的总收入中，占80％是商品性生产收入。多种经营生产的发展，在资金上、生产工具和肥料等方面有力地支援了农业生产的发展，今年全社粮食总产量达三千二百五十万斤，比去年增加30％。商品粮一千二百三十万斤，比去年增加70％。
    樟市公社最近总结了今年全面大跃进的经验以后，高瞻远瞩而又实事求是地制订出明年继续全面大跃进的生产规划。按照这个规划，明年全社多种经营，总收入将达到八百万元，比今年增长一倍。畜禽业方面，强调以发展养猪为中心，从今年底生猪存栏量八千头的基础上发展至二万五千头（其中包括社员私养五千头，即每户私养一头）；鸡、鸭、鹅生产从今年底存栏量十三万七千多只发展至四十万只。淡水养殖方面，从今年实产三十万斤发展至一百万斤。具有大宗收入的木炭和山竹子生产，根据国家的需要，明年要更进一步发展。此外，甘蔗、油菜、棉花、黄豆、红瓜子等经济作物，明年扩种九千亩，其中春收的九千亩油菜（比今年春收油菜增加六千亩）已生长茂盛，开始扬花。
    樟市公社分析了实现明年多种经营生产规划的有利条件，采取了确保这个规划实现的具体措施。这个公社经过今年一年来的努力，已经拥有足够的生产资金，在技术上也已打下了继续跃进的良好基础。公社所属的十二项开发山区资源企业，已经从土法生产过渡到半土半洋生产，从手工操作过渡到半机械化。今年已购置了两部汽车、七部拖拉机、四艘电船，在山岭中开辟了共长一百三十多华里公路，目前仍投放七百个劳动力继续开辟山中公路。全社已拥有三百个畜禽饲养场和八百多亩饲料基地，已经储备好的精粗饲料，就足够明年发展养猪的需要；同时，全社现在已拥有一千四百头母猪，明年所需的猪苗，公社自己可以解决。此外，明年扩种各种经济作物所需的种子和化学肥料，目前已经备足。
    樟市公社充分考虑到明年农业和多种经营继续跃进，将碰到劳力不足的困难。明年全社计划扩种水稻一万多亩，扩种经济作物九千亩，最近又抽调出三百多个劳动力支援国家工业建设，这就出现了明年工作量大大增加而劳动力又相对缩小的矛盾。根据全社运输耗费劳动量最大的情况，目前公社大抓工具改革，准备增加三千部牛车和手推车，增添这批运输工具，加上今年全社增加的六百多头牛，就等于新增加几千个强劳动力。根据全社每年烧石灰耗费劳力较多的情况（今年用去二十多万个工），今年秋收结束以后，各生产队已提前投放大批力量赶烧石灰，到目前为止，全社已生产石灰七百一十万斤，估计春耕开始前，就可全部完成明年全年所需的石灰，为明年农副业生产节约出大批劳动力。从目前的措施和行动情况看，只要发挥冲天干劲，进行实干、巧干，劳力不足的困难是可以解决的。
