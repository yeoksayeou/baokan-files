The issue of being both Red and expert is a matter of worldview
Hu Sheng
    In order to develop our country's socialist construction, we need a strong scientific and technological force, and a group of highly skilled and outstanding scientists, inventors, and other technical experts. Our requirement for such a team is to be both Red and expert. The experts needed for socialist construction are experts who are closely integrated with the workers and peasants, who have established a proletarian worldview, and who can master modern science and technology. This is the path that all our experts should take. Along this path, our country's scientific and technological force has grown rapidly over the past decade. Many old experts from the old society have gradually changed their attitude towards workers and peasants, gradually abandoned the bourgeois worldview and begun to accept the proletarian worldview. A large number of young people, in the new society, directly under the leadership and cultivation of the Party, have been and are making themselves into specialized talents with expertise in a certain field. There are also many Party cadres who participated in the revolution for many years and were originally laymen in natural science and technology, but in recent years, according to the Party's arrangements, have engaged in scientific and technological work and study, and through hard work, have also begun to have expertise in certain areas. These are all very gratifying things. Of course, all these people should continue to strictly demand themselves according to the standard of "both Red and expert," so that they can continuously improve themselves politically and professionally.
  In our scientific and technological team, the proportion of the younger generation will of course become larger and larger, and the number of cadres who have been engaged in revolutionary struggle for a long time and become experts in socialist construction will also increase. In the younger generation, the burden of old ideas is generally less than that of the old experts from the old society, and they have grown up in the new society receiving revolutionary education. However, many facts prove that they still need to make great efforts to solve the problem of being both Red and expert, to truly establish a proletarian worldview, and to stand completely and unswervingly on the side of the proletariat. Even those cadres who have been engaged in revolutionary work for many years, in the process of striving to become experts, or after becoming experts, if they think that the problem of being Red has been solved and there is no need to pay attention to this problem anymore, they will also go down the wrong path in political thought. Therefore, every expert in science and technology, regardless of what work he has done in the past, must not neglect the fundamental principle that Red and expert must be combined at any time, and must be vigilant against falling into the erroneous tendency of so-called "only expert but not Red."
    The vast majority of comrades who have been engaged in revolutionary work for many years and then engaged in science and technology work are able to work hard according to the requirements of being both Red and expert. They deeply feel that they have undertaken a serious task assigned by the Party; since they have obtained fully favorable conditions to learn new skills under the Party's arrangement, they should work hard to complete this task. When they have any achievements, they are not arrogant and complacent, but only happy because they have the possibility to further undertake more of the Party's tasks. They are also fully aware of their responsibility as Communist Party members on the science and technology front. In addition to working hard to learn new skills, they should also become the backbone in implementing the Party's line and policies on this front. Therefore, they strive to improve themselves politically, strive to use the exemplary behavior of proletarian fighters to influence and unite the people around them, and fight against various erroneous tendencies. This attitude is of course completely correct. However, there are also a very small number of people who take the opposite attitude. They think that they have some achievements in their work, and they can ask the Party and the people for independence. They do not regard these achievements as being cultivated by the Party and the people. They become proud and attribute the achievements entirely to their own name, and become obsessed with fame and status. In this way, they separate Red and expert and begin to deviate from the correct path of being both Red and expert as proletarian experts.
    Why do some comrades embark on this wrong path? It can be seen that the comrades who have made this mistake, even if they have participated in the revolution for many years, have not truly and thoroughly solved their worldview problem. Bourgeois individualism and bourgeois liberalism, these views that are opposed to the proletarian worldview, are still deeply buried in their souls. Since this wrong idea still exists, as long as there are appropriate conditions, it will grow like a certain poisonous bacteria under appropriate temperature and humidity. In our current transitional society, the struggle against bourgeois ideology and the habits of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie is still a long-term task. Bourgeois ideology invades people through various different channels, and unhealthy people are easily captured under this invasion. Of course, if they did not participate in science and technology work but participated in other aspects of work, their mistakes may also break out. However, it should be pointed out that in the field of activity as scientists and technical experts, it is often possible to provide conditions conducive to the growth of this kind of bacteria. Because, this aspect of work, in terms of its manifestation, to a considerable extent, carries the nature of individual labor, and in this field, the traditional influence of the bourgeoisie is very deep.
    When Lenin talked about the characteristics of intellectuals resisting the discipline of the proletariat, he said: "The characteristic of intellectuals as a special class in modern capitalist society, generally and as a whole, is precisely individualism and the inability to accept discipline and organization; ... This characteristic of intellectuals is closely related to their usual living conditions and the conditions of earning a living that are close to the living conditions of the petty bourgeoisie in many aspects (working alone or in very small groups, etc.)." Lenin also quoted Kautsky's analysis of intellectuals when he was still a Marxist. Kautsky compared the living conditions and working conditions of intellectuals with those of the proletariat, and he said: "The proletariat has no strength when he is still a lonely individual. All his strength, all his ability to progress, all his hopes and desires are drawn from organization, from his planned joint activities with his comrades. When he becomes part of a great and powerful organism, he feels that he is great and powerful." But "intellectuals are completely different. He does not fight by using strength in this way or that way, but by using arguments. His weapon is his personal knowledge, personal ability, and personal beliefs." Here, what Lenin and Kautsky, when he was still a Marxist, said is about intellectuals in capitalist society. The purpose of this kind of intellectuals' "struggle" is actually only for the individual, so they regard personal knowledge and ability as their entire weapon. This kind of intellectual is very obviously following the bourgeoisie ideologically. Their thoughts, before being thoroughly transformed, are bound to conflict with the discipline of the proletariat and socialist collectivism.
    In our socialist society, the working conditions of scientists and technical experts are different from those in the old society due to the strengthening of collectivity and the establishment of ties with the masses. This difference is obviously in line with the laws of scientific and technological development. Because any scientific invention, on the surface, seems to be the result of a certain person's research, but in reality, there are always many other people's research results (including the experience of failure) that have prepared him, and all scientific knowledge, in the final analysis, comes from the labor production practice and class struggle practice of the people. At the same time, and more importantly, socialist society also puts forward a lofty goal of struggle for all intellectuals, and directly links their every immediate work with this great goal, which is the goal of struggling for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the victory of socialism and communism. When an intellectual truly establishes a communist worldview, he will feel that no matter how capable he is, he is only a soldier in the vast people's team engaged in the great struggle under the leadership of the Party, just like a screw on a machine, as people usually say. Such a screw, on the one hand, if separated from the entire machine, will accomplish nothing, so there is nothing to boast about; but on the other hand, it is not insignificant and humble, because it is a molecule belonging to that great and vital organism.
    However, if a person has not truly established a communist worldview, it is difficult for him to resist the habits left over from bourgeois society in the cause of science and technology. The goal of struggle in his mind is actually only personal interests. When he has a slight achievement in scientific and technological work, he raises his tail high. He feels that he has gained an "independent" position by "his own" knowledge and ability. He always tries to exaggerate the nature of individual labor in scientific and technological work, and tries to win honor and status for himself. He has forgotten that he was able to learn a little skill because of the Party's cultivation and because society gave him the opportunity. He forgets his roots like Liu Jie Mei, who came from a poor peasant background and got a rich life by relying on the revolution, and in turn complains that the Party's leadership, the Party's discipline, and the Party's policy of developing the cause of science and technology "hinder" his "development."
    Although there are very few people among our comrades who allow the germs of bourgeois ideology to grow in their minds to the point that they are completely dominated by it, all comrades engaged in scientific and technological work should learn a profound lesson from this.
    So, what conclusion needs to be drawn here? The conclusion is certainly not to say that one should avoid becoming an expert, or that one should regard the work of experts in science and technology as a "dangerous profession" and stay away from it. The conclusion can only be that at any time and under any conditions, one should adhere to the proletarian worldview, not relax the struggle against the bourgeois worldview, prevent the restoration of the bourgeois worldview in one's own mind, and should firmly advance along the path of being both Red and expert advocated by the Party, and resolutely deny any fallacy that is convenient for slipping into the evil path of only being expert but not Red.
    "I'm already Red, now the problem is only to be expert." - This statement actually requires only being expert but not Red.
    For many Party cadres, the Party has indeed given them a task to strive to become experts who are proficient in a certain specialty. But this does not mean that they no longer need to pay attention to improving their political level, and no longer need to strengthen their proletarian worldview. What does it mean to establish a proletarian worldview? A worldview is the fundamental viewpoint that is implemented in dealing with everything. People must treat everything with a proletarian viewpoint in any situation, neither wavering due to different objective environments, nor changing due to different personal circumstances, whether in smooth times or in times of frustration, whether in enthusiastic mass struggles or in quiet laboratories, whether when working as an "unknown soldier" with his head down, or when he has achieved something and is praised by society.... This is what it means to truly establish a proletarian worldview. In order to achieve this, people need to constantly train themselves. With the changes in the overall social conditions (for example, from the historical stage of the democratic revolution to the historical stage of the socialist revolution), and with the changes in personal circumstances (for example, from one job to another, from a job that has not yet achieved results to a job that has already achieved results), special attention must be paid not to deviate from the proletarian worldview. Not long after the national liberation, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that after passing the "war pass," it is also necessary to pass the "land reform pass" and the "socialist pass" well. This is in terms of the big picture. It can also be said that in the process of participating in the revolution in one's life, one has to go through many "passes." Relying on the Marxist-Leninist worldview, people can pass every "pass" well. Some people may pass this one "pass" well, but not the next one, for example, those who pass the "land reform pass" well, but not the "socialist pass," those who pass the "failure pass" well, but not the "success pass," and so on. It is not that the proletarian worldview is not useful for the next pass, the problem is that he thinks that since he has passed this "pass" well, the problem of being Red has already been solved, and therefore he has left the proletarian worldview. As for those who have not passed this "pass" so well, if they are not vigilant, they will of course be even more dangerous when passing the next "pass."
    In political and ideological issues, there is no absolutely blank area. Where the proletarian worldview does not occupy, the bourgeois worldview will occupy. "I'm already Red," "there is no need to pay attention to whether I am Red or not" - this is a concession to the bourgeois worldview, opening the door for the bourgeois worldview.
    "The task of being expert is so urgent that raising the issue of being Red again will hinder being expert." - This is an old and stale tune to defend only being expert but not Red.
    The task of being expert is indeed very urgent, but because we want to be expert faster and better, we must emphasize being Red even more. It is completely wrong to think that being Red will hinder being expert.
    There are indeed experts who are not Red, that is, experts who hold a bourgeois worldview and serve the bourgeoisie. If the proletariat needs such experts, they can also be hired to do work, provided that they must be honest and not make trouble. Of course, we must also do our best to help them transform themselves. If they insist on not changing their bourgeois worldview, or even continue to stand on the bourgeois position politically, they will never work wholeheartedly for the people, and it will be impossible to gain the trust of the people. It is completely wrong to think that regardless of whether one is Red or not, as long as one is expert, one can bargain with the people, or even stand on top of the people and do whatever one wants.
    In capitalist society, many experts who are not Red will be produced. Although such experts may also be dissatisfied with this or that aspect of capitalist society, generally speaking, their worldview is consistent with the dominant ideology in that society, so they are like fish in water, and of course they can easily grow up. But in our society, it will only become more and more difficult to become an expert without being Red. This is not only because society opposes such experts and does not cultivate such experts, but also because people who hold a bourgeois worldview and refuse to give it up are bound to be incompatible with socialism in all aspects and contradict each other. The personal goals they seek cannot be satisfied in this society, so they are naturally unwilling to spend hard work in the aspect of seeking expertise, because according to their worldview, it is "not worth" spending hard work in this case.
    In our society, what force drives people to work hard in the cause of science, not afraid of difficulties and obstacles, and to forge ahead? What force makes people muster their energy and never stop until they reach the peak of science and technology? This force is the strong will to build our country into a great socialist country and then build communism, this force is the noble desire to serve the interests of the broadest masses of the people from the proletarian worldview, such a force is many times higher than the motivation of personal interests. In our society, if a person is separated from this force, he will only decline in will and be listless, let alone strive to be expert.
    Isn't this exactly the case? Those who make trouble for status and power as soon as they have made a little achievement in their work, and are dissatisfied with this and dissatisfied with that, although they think they have the "capital" of being "expert," in fact, not only has their little bit of Red faded away, but they have also reached their end in the aspect of "expert." Their heads are full of calculations of personal interests, where can they still fit in science? If they do not politically change their course, they will not have any success in the aspect of being expert, this can be asserted.
    "After all, I am a Party expert, more capable than non-Party experts." - Some people claim this way.
    A true Party expert should be more capable than non-Party experts in terms of mastering the proletarian worldview, in terms of implementing the Party's policies and implementing the Party's leadership guidelines, and therefore can become the backbone and core in the scientific and technological cause led by the Party. If these characteristics are lost, what is he more capable of than non-Party experts?
    Some non-Party experts, due to accepting the Party's leadership, raising their political awareness, and accepting the proletarian worldview, can become proletarian experts. And some so-called "Party experts" will also leave the Party due to political degeneration. Isn't this the dialectic in real life?
    The Party cannot allow certain non-Party experts who adhere to the bourgeois worldview to control the cause of science and technology, and the Party cannot allow so-called "Party experts" who adhere to the bourgeois worldview to control the cause of science and technology.
    "The cause of science and technology is a special profession, and the Party cannot lead it." - This is to abolish the Party's leadership, to separate the cause of science and technology from the politics of the proletariat, from socialism, and to separate expertise from being Red.
    The Party can lead all undertakings, and can also lead the cause of science and technology. The Party's leadership ensures that our cause of science and technology serves socialism, becomes an important and organic part of the entire socialist cause, and also ensures that our cause of science and technology can develop faster and better along the socialist road than under the capitalist system. How can the Party's leadership be abolished? Those who oppose the Party's leadership have not only no socialism in their minds, but also no cause of science and technology, only personal interests. This kind of plan that starts from personal interests is fundamentally incompatible with the Party's leadership and with socialism. The proposition of only being expert but not Red is bound to lead to opposition to the Party's leadership, which fully proves that this is an extremely harmful proposition for the development of our country's scientific and technological cause.
    In the field of scientific and technological work, the reason why the issue of Red and expert needs to be repeatedly emphasized is precisely because it reflects that in this field, the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview is far from over. But the situation of the struggle and its development prospects are very clear. The proletariat in this field has developed from almost no position at all to establishing a solid foundation, and has formed a reliable team under the leadership of the Party. This team is composed of the young and old parts mentioned above. It is absolutely impossible for any evil wind to disintegrate this team, no matter where it comes from.
    The current major task of all scientific and technological workers is to shatter various evil winds that are opposed to the proletarian worldview under the leadership of the Party, constantly strive for being both Red and expert, constantly expand our scientific and technological work team, and make our scientific and technological work constantly leap forward with the leap forward of the socialist economic and cultural construction cause.

    又红又专的问题是世界观的问题
    胡绳
    为了发展我国的社会主义建设事业，我们需要一支强大的科学技术队伍，需要一批有高度水平的杰出的科学家、发明家和其他技术专家。对于这样一支队伍，我们的要求是又红又专。社会主义建设所需要的专家是同工农群众密切结合的、树立了无产阶级世界观的、能够掌握现代科学技术的专家。这是我们的一切专家所应当走的道路。沿着这条道路，十年来，我国的科学技术队伍已经迅速成长起来。许多从旧社会来的老专家，逐步地改变自己对工农群众的态度，逐步地抛弃资产阶级世界观而开始接受无产阶级世界观。大量的年青人，在新社会中，直接在党的领导和培养下，已经和正在使自己成为具有某一方面特长的专门人材。还有不少党的干部，过去多年参加革命，对于自然科学和技术本来是门外汉，但是在近若干年来，根据党的分配，进行了科学技术方面的工作和学习，经过刻苦努力，也开始具有某方面的专长。这都是很可喜的事情。当然，这几部分人都应当继续用“又红又专”的标准严格要求自己，使自己在政治和业务方面都不断地进步。
  在我们的科学技术队伍中，年青的一代所占的比重当然会越来越大，长期进行革命斗争的干部成为社会主义建设事业中的专家的人也会越来越多。在年青一代人的身上，旧思想的负担，一般说来，总比从旧社会来的老专家少，他们又是在新社会中受到革命的教育而成长起来的。但是许多事实证明，他们要解决又红又专的问题，真正建立起无产阶级世界观，彻底地、毫不动摇地站在无产阶级的方面，仍然需要经过很大的努力。就是那些多年从事革命工作的干部，在努力使自己成为专家的过程中，或者在成为专家以后，如果以为自己在红的一方面的问题已经解决，不需要再注意这个问题了，那也会在政治思想上走到错误的道路上去。所以每一个在科学技术方面的专家，不管他过去做过些什么工作，在任何时候都不能忽略了红与专必须结合的这个根本道理，都必须警惕自己不要陷入所谓“只专不红”这个错误的倾向。
    多年参加革命工作之后又从事科学技术方面的工作的同志，绝大多数都是能够按照又红又专的要求而努力的。他们深切地感到，自己是承担了党所指定的一个严重任务；既然在党的安排下取得了充分有利的条件来学会新的本领，那么就应该发奋努力，完成这个任务。在有了任何成就的时候，他们并不骄傲自满，只是因为自己有可能进一步更多地承担党的任务而高兴。他们也充分意识到，作为共产党员在科学技术战线上的责任，除了自己努力学会新的本领以外，还应当成为在这条战线上执行党的路线、政策的骨干，因此他们努力在政治上提高自己，力求用无产阶级战士的模范行为来影响和团结周围的人，并且向各种错误的倾向作斗争。这种态度当然是完全正确的。但是也有很少数的一些人采取了相反的态度，他们以为自己有了业务上的一些成就，就可以向党向人民闹独立性，他们不把这些成就看成是党和人民培养出来的，他们骄傲起来，把成就完全归于自己的名下，迷恋于名誉和地位。这样，他们就把红和专割裂开来，开始脱离作为无产阶级专家的又红又专的正确道路。
    为什么有些同志会走上这种错误的道路呢？可以看到，犯了这种错误的同志，即使过去多年参加革命，但是并没有真正彻底解决他们的世界观问题，资产阶级的个人主义，资产阶级的自由主义这些同无产阶级世界观相对立的观点，还深深地埋藏在他们的灵魂深处。这种错误的思想既然还存在着，那么只要有了适当的条件，好像某种毒菌在适当的温度湿度下，就会滋长起来。在我们现在过渡时期的社会中，同资产阶级的思想、资产阶级和小资产阶级的习惯势力作斗争，还是一个长期的任务。资产阶级思想通过各种不同的孔道向人们侵袭，不健康的人很容易在这种侵袭下被俘虏。当然，如果他们不是参加科学技术方面的工作而参加了别的方面的工作，他们的错误同样也有可能发作起来。但是应该指出，在作为科学家和技术专家而活动的领域内，往往能够提供便利于这种毒菌滋长的条件。因为，这方面的工作，就表现形式看来，在相当大的程度上带着个体劳动的性质，而且在这个领域内，资产阶级的传统影响很深。
    列宁在谈到知识分子同无产阶级的纪律性相对抗的特性时，曾经这样说：“作为现代资本主义社会中特殊阶层的知识分子，他们的特点，一般和整个说来，正是个人主义和不能接受纪律性和组织性；……知识分子的这种特性是同他们通常的生活条件，同他们在很多方面接近于小资产阶级生存条件的谋生条件（单独工作或者在很小的集体里工作等等）有密切联系的。”列宁又引用了考茨基在他还是马克思主义者的时候对于知识分子的一种分析。考茨基把知识分子的生活状况和劳动条件同无产者做了个对比，他说：“无产者在他还是孤零零的个体时是没有什么力量的。他的全部力量，他走向进步的全部能力，他的一切希望和愿望，都是从组织中，从他和同志们的有计划的共同活动中汲取来的。当他成为伟大而强有力的机体的一部分时，他就觉得自己是伟大而强有力的了。”但是“知识分子却完全不是这样的。他并不是这样或那样运用实力来进行斗争，而是利用论据来进行斗争。他的武器就是他个人的知识，个人的能力，个人的信念。”在这里，列宁和还是马克思主义者时候的考茨基所说的是资本主义社会中的知识分子，这种知识分子的“斗争”的目的实际上只是为了个人，因而他们就把个人的知识和能力等等作为自己的全部武器。这种知识分子，在思想上很明显地是跟着资产阶级走的，他们的思想在没有经过彻底改造以前，必然同无产阶级的纪律性和社会主义的集体主义发生冲突。
    在我们的社会主义社会中，科学家、技术专家的工作条件，由于加强集体性和建立同群众的联系，已经和在旧社会中有所不同了。这种不同，显然是符合于科学技术的发展规律的。因为任何科学发明，表面上看来，好像是某一个人研究的成果，但实际上，总是有其他许多人的研究成果（其中包括失败的经验）为他作了准备，并且一切科学知识，归根到底说来，是来源于人民群众的劳动生产的实践和阶级斗争的实践。同时，更重要的是，社会主义社会还为一切知识分子提出了一个崇高的奋斗目标，把他们每一个眼前的工作和这个伟大目标直接联系起来，这就是为广大人民的利益，为社会主义和共产主义的胜利而奋斗的目标。当一个知识分子真正确立了共产主义世界观的时候，他就会感到，自己无论有多大本领，也不过是在党的领导下进行着伟大斗争的广大人民队伍中的一个战士，好像人们通常所说的一架机器上的一个螺丝钉一样。这样的螺丝钉，就一方面说来，如果脱离了整个机器，就会一事无成，因此没有什么值得自我吹嘘的；但就另一方面说来，又并不是渺小卑微的，因为它是从属于那个具有伟大生命力的机体上的一个分子。
    但是如果一个人没有真正建立共产主义的世界观，他就很难抵抗在科学技术事业中从资产阶级社会中遗留下来的习惯势力。他心目中的奋斗目标其实不过是个人的利益，当他在科学技术工作中稍有成就的时候，他就高高地翘起尾巴了。他觉得，凭“自己的”知识和能力他已经取得“独立”的地位了。他总是竭力夸大科学技术工作所带有的个体劳动的性质，竭力为自己争取荣誉和地位。他已经忘记掉，他之所以能学到一点本领，是靠了党的培养，是由于社会给了他机会。他像农村中出身于贫农依靠革命而得到了富裕生活的刘介梅一样地忘了本，反过来埋怨党的领导、党的纪律、党的发展科学技术事业的政策“妨害”了他的“发展”。
    听任资产阶级思想的病菌在自己头脑中滋长起来，以至使自己完全为它所支配的人，在我们的同志中虽然是极少数，但是一切从事科学技术工作的同志是应当由此受到深刻的教训的。
    那么，在这里需要得到什么结论呢？结论当然不是说，应当避免成为专家，应当把科学技术方面的专家的工作看成是“危险的职业”而远远避开。结论只能是，在任何时候、任何条件下，都应当坚持无产阶级世界观，都不放松对资产阶级世界观的斗争，制止资产阶级世界观在自己头脑中复辟，应当坚定地沿着党所提倡的又红又专的道路前进，坚决地否定任何为了便于溜到只专不红的邪路上去的谬论。
    “已经红了，现在的问题只是专。”——这种说法实际上就是要求只专不红。
    对于许多党员干部，党的确给了他们一个任务，努力成为精通某种专业的专家。但这并不是说，他们再不需要注意提高自己的政治水平，再不需要加强自己的无产阶级世界观了。怎样才叫做确立无产阶级世界观？世界观是贯彻在对待一切事情上的根本观点。人们必须在任何情况下都用无产阶级的观点来对待一切事情，既不因客观环境的不同而动摇，也不因个人境遇的不同而改变，在顺利的时候是这样，在受到挫折的时候也是这样，在热烈的群众斗争中是这样，在静悄悄的试验室里也是这样，在作为一个“无名小卒”而埋头工作的时候是这样，在有了什么成就而受到社会的表扬的时候也是这样……。这才叫做真正建立了无产阶级世界观。为了达到这一点，人们需要不断地进行锻炼。随着整个社会条件的变化（例如从民主革命的历史阶段到了社会主义革命的历史阶段），随着个人境遇的改变（例如从一个工作岗位转到了另一个工作岗位，从工作尚未取得成绩到已经取得成绩），特别需要注意不要脱离了无产阶级世界观。还在全国解放后不久，毛泽东同志就曾指出，在过了“战争关”以后，还要很好地过“土改关”和“社会主义关”。这是就大的方面来说的。也可以说，在人一生参加革命的过程中，要经历许许多多的“关”。依靠马克思列宁主义世界观，人们才能过好每一个“关”。有人也许过好了这一个关，却过不好下一个关，例如过好“土改关”的，过不好“社会主义关”，过好“失败关”的，过不好“成功关”等等。并不是无产阶级世界观对下一个关不管用了，问题是在于他以为既然过好了这一“关”，红的问题就已经解决了，因而离开了无产阶级世界观。至于在这一“关”过得并不那么好的人，如果不加警惕，在过下一“关”的时候，那当然是更加危险了。
    在政治思想问题上，没有绝对空白的领域。无产阶级世界观不去占领的地方，资产阶级世界观就来占领。“已经红了”，“不必再注意红不红的问题”，这就是向资产阶级世界观让步，为资产阶级世界观开门。
    “专的任务这样迫切，再要提出红的问题就会妨害了专。”——这是为只专不红辩护的一种陈腐的老调。
    专的任务的确很迫切，但因为要专得更快更好，就更要强调红。以为红会妨害专，是完全错误的。
    不红的专家的确是有的，那就是抱着资产阶级世界观，为资产阶级服务的专家，对于这样的专家，无产阶级如果需要的话，也可以雇佣来做工作，条件是必须老老实实，不准捣乱。当然，我们也要尽力帮助他们自我改造。他们如果坚持不改变资产阶级世界观，甚至在政治上继续站在资产阶级立场，他们就决不会全心全意为人民工作，也就不可能得到人民的信任。以为不管红不红，只要是专了，就可以向人民讨价还价，甚至站到人民头上，为所欲为，这种算盘是完全打错了。
    在资本主义社会里会产生很多不红的专家，这样的专家尽管也可能对资本主义社会的这个或那个方面有所不满，但总的说来，他们的世界观和那个社会中的统治思想是一致的，因此他们如鱼在水，当然很容易成长起来。但是在我们的社会里，不红而成为专家却只会愈来愈困难了。这不仅是因为社会反对这种专家，不培养这种专家，而且因为抱着资产阶级世界观不肯丢掉的人，必然在各个方面和社会主义格格不入，互相抵触。他们所企求的个人目的不可能从这个社会中得到满足，自然就不愿意在求专的方面花苦功，因为按照他们的世界观，在这种情况下是“值不得”花苦功的。
    在我们的社会中，是什么力量推动人们在科学事业上不怕艰苦困难，披荆斩棘地努力前进呢？是什么力量使人们鼓足干劲，不达科学技术的高峰决不中止呢？这种力量就是为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家并进而建设共产主义的强烈意志，这种力量就是从无产阶级世界观出发的为最广大人民利益服务的高尚愿望，这样的力量比那种个人利益的动机不知道高多少倍。在我们的社会中，一个人如果脱离了这种力量，就只会意志衰退，没精打采，更谈不到什么努力求专了。
    事实难道不正是这样么？那种在业务上有了一点成就就闹地位，争权力，这也不满，那也不满的人，虽然自以为是有了“专”的“本钱”，但是其实不但他们的那一点红已经消褪下去，而且在“专”的方面也已经到了他们的尽头了。他们满脑袋装的是个人利益的计较，哪里还装得进科学？如果他们不在政治上改弦更张，他们在专的方面也不会有什么出息，这是可以断言的。
    “终究我是党内专家，比党外专家高明一些。”——有的人这样声称。
    真正的党的专家，应当在掌握无产阶级世界观的方面，在执行党的政策、贯彻党的领导方针的方面，比党外的专家更高明，因而能够成为党所领导的科学技术事业中的骨干和核心。如果丧失了这些特点，他究竟有什么比党外的专家更高明的呢？
    有些党外的专家，由于接受党的领导，提高自己的政治觉悟，接受无产阶级世界观，可以变成为无产阶级的专家。而有些所谓“党内专家”也会因为在政治上的堕落而离开党。这难道不是实际生活中的辩证法么？
    党不能容许某些坚持资产阶级世界观的党外的专家把持科学技术事业，同样，党也不能容许坚持资产阶级世界观的所谓“党内专家”把持科学技术事业。
    “科学技术事业是特殊的专业，党是领导不了的。”——这是要取消党的领导，使科学技术事业脱离无产阶级的政治，脱离社会主义，使专脱离红。
    党能够领导一切事业，也能够领导科学技术事业。党的领导保证了我们的科学技术事业为社会主义服务，成为整个社会主义事业中的一个重要的有机部分，也保证我们的科学技术事业按照社会主义的道路能够发展得比在资本主义制度下更快更好。党的领导怎么能够取消呢？反对党的领导的人，心目中不但没有社会主义，其实也没有科学技术事业，有的只是个人的利益，这种一切从个人利益出发的打算，同党的领导、同社会主义是根本不相容的。只专不红的主张，结果必然要引导到反对党的领导，这就充分证明了，这是对于我国科学技术事业的发展极端有害的主张。
    在科学技术工作的领域内，红与专的问题之所以需要反复地强调，正是反映了在这个领域内，无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争还远没有结束。但是斗争的形势和它的发展前途是很清楚的。无产阶级在这个领域内已经从几乎完全没有地位发展到建立了巩固的基础，已经结成了一个在党的领导下的可靠的队伍，这支队伍就是由上面所说的年青和年长的几部分人所组成的。任何歪风邪气，不论来自哪个方面，要想瓦解这个队伍是绝对不可能的了。
    一切科学技术工作者当前的重大任务，就是在党的领导下粉碎各种同无产阶级世界观对立的歪风邪气，不断地为又红又专而奋斗，使我们的科学技术工作的队伍不断地更加扩大，使我们的科学技术工作，随着社会主义经济和文化建设事业的跃进而不断地向前跃进。
