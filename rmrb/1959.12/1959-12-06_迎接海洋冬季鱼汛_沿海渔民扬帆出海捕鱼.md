Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Coastal fishermen in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces are setting sail, welcoming the marine winter fishing season. The Zhoushan fishing grounds have already entered the peak of winter fishing.

Winter is the season when hairtail, small yellow croaker, and seven-star grouper spawn in China's coastal waters. This year, there have been more northeasterly winds along the coast, and it has been colder earlier. In addition, this year's drought has resulted in less mainland drainage, leading to the propagation of a lot of plankton (hairtail bait) along the coast. As a result, hairtail have formed schools early and approached the fishing grounds ahead of schedule. Therefore, fishing boats in various places have set sail early. The Zhoushan fishing grounds are currently experiencing a large hairtail catch. The seven-star grouper winter fishing season in the Dachen and Nanji, Beiji fishing grounds is also good. A large number of small yellow croaker have spawned in Xiapu County, Fujian, and a large number of swimming crabs and jellyfish have also been discovered. The first batch of fishing boats put into winter fishing production in Xin Hailian City, Jiangsu Province, have already caught a large number of fish and shrimp, firing the first shot in winter production. The Liaodong Bay and northern Yellow Sea fishing areas, due to their proximity to the ice age, are organizing port transfers to participate in winter fishing production.

This year, the people's communes in various coastal areas have also made relatively sufficient preparations to welcome the winter fishing season. During the winter fishing season preparation period, the state allocated a considerable amount of timber, palm fiber, silver thread and other materials to support the construction of ships and the repairing of nets by the people's communes in coastal areas. Therefore, the number of boats and nets going out to sea this winter fishing season is more than in previous years. Coastal provinces have issued instructions or held meetings before the winter fishing season. The CCP Xin Hailian City Committee in Jiangsu Province also sent responsible cadres to go out to sea with the boats to direct operations. Responsible cadres of the CCP Zhoushan County Committee in Zhejiang Province not only went out to sea with the boats, but also conducted experimental ship trials.

While conducting winter fishing, many coastal areas have also carried out port aquaculture harvesting and shellfish harvesting from tidal flats. Shandong Province has had a bumper harvest of prawns farmed in ports this year, and fish production has also increased significantly.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th: In winter seawater fishing production, Penglai County, Shandong Province, has vigorously innovated technology, resulting in a straight-line increase in the yield of fish, shrimp, shellfish, algae, and other products. As of November 20th, the county has completed its annual production task ahead of schedule and above target. At present, all the large and small fishing boats in the county have gone out to sea, and the fishermen are determined to catch more fish and shrimp in December.

Their technological innovations are multifaceted. In the past, when "mother-child boats" went out to sea, the task of the "mother ship" was only to transport supplies and provide food and lodging for the fishermen. Now, after reform in Penglai County, the "mother ship" and "child ship" can operate simultaneously, greatly increasing the catch. They have also changed the clumsy crotch net into a light and fast net, and expanded the mouth of the jar net, increasing the catch per net by more than 40% compared to the past. Roller bearings have been installed on the net-hauling windlass, saving two laborers per net haul compared to the past. While reforming the tools, they also adjusted the labor organization, achieving a combination of key operations and concurrent operations; multiple tools per boat, multiple uses per tool, multiple skills per person, hook-net combination, net-hook combination; combination of distant-sea fishing and near-sea fishing; combination of distant-sea and near-sea fishing with mobilizing male and female semi-laborers to "catch small seas"; combination of grasping high yields and grasping economic fish; simultaneous grasping of fish and shrimp, crab, shellfish, algae, and jellyfish; combination of aquatic product purchase and sales and material supply.

In order to strengthen the leadership of winter seawater production, the CCP Penglai County Committee specially established an aquatic product headquarters and organized coastal work teams to specifically guide aquatic product production. Cadres at all levels personally went out to sea to fish with the fishermen, eating, living, and working together. The communes and production teams all held mobilization rallies, established martial arts stages and hero lists, setting off a vigorous mass movement for seawater fishing.

    迎接海洋冬季鱼汛
    沿海渔民扬帆出海捕鱼
    新华社5日讯　海洋冬季渔汛到来、山东、江苏、浙江、福建等省沿海渔民纷纷扬帆出海。舟山渔场已经进入冬季捕捞的高潮。
    冬季是我国沿海带鱼、小黄鱼、七星鱼等鱼类发海的季节。今年沿海东北风较多，冷得较早，加上今年干旱，大陆排水少，沿海浮游生物（带鱼的饵料）繁殖很多，因而带鱼结群早，提早靠近渔场。因此，各地渔船都提早出海。目前舟山渔场正大捕带鱼。大陈和南、北麂等渔场七星鱼冬汛也发的好。福建霞浦县的小黄鱼大发海，并发现有大量的梭子蟹和海蜇。江苏省新海连市投入冬捕生产的第一批渔船，已捕获了大量鱼虾，打响了冬季生产第一炮，辽东湾和黄海北部渔区，因临近冰期，正组织转港参加冬汛生产。
    今年沿海各地人民公社迎接冬季渔汛的准备工作也做得比较充分。冬汛准备期间，国家调拨了相当数量的木材、棕片、银丝线等物资，支援沿海各地人民公社造船补网。因此，今年冬汛出海船网比往年为多。沿海各省冬汛前都发出指示或者开过会议。中共江苏省新海连市委还派出负责干部随船出海指挥。中共浙江省舟山县委负责干部不但随船出海，而且搞试验船。
    在冬汛捕捞的同时，沿海许多地区还进行了港养起水和贝类起滩工作。山东省今年港养的对虾获得了丰收，鱼的产量也有很大增长。
    新华社济南5日电　山东省蓬莱县在冬季海水捕捞生产中由于大力革新技术，使捕捞的鱼、虾、贝、藻等产量直线上升，到11月20日止，全县已经提前超额完成了全年生产任务。目前全县大小渔船已全部出海，渔民们决心在12月份内再捕捞更多的鱼虾。
    他们的技术革新是多方面的。过去，“母子船”出海作业时，“母船”的任务只是用来运送物资和供渔民吃饭睡觉。现在，蓬莱县经过改革，“母船”和“子船”能同时作业，使捕捞产量大大增加。他们还把拙笨的裤裆网改成轻快网，把坛子网扩大了网口，使每网的捕捞量都比以前提高40％多。起网的辘轳装上了滚珠轴承，起一条网能比以前省两个劳力。在工具改革的同时，还调整了劳动组织，作到了重点作业和兼作业相结合；一船多具，一具多用，一人多技，钩兼网，网兼钩，钩网结合；远洋捕捞和近海捕捞相结合；远洋近海捕捞和发动男女半劳力赶小海相结合；抓高产和抓经济鱼类相结合；捞鱼和狠捕虾、蟹子、贝、藻、海蜇一齐抓；水产品购销和物资供应相结合。
    中共蓬莱县委为了加强冬季海水生产的领导，专门成立了水产指挥部，并且组织沿海工作组具体指导水产生产。各级干部都亲自和渔民一块出海捕捞，同吃、同住、同劳动。各公社、生产队都举行了誓师大会，设立比武台、英雄榜，掀起轰轰烈烈的海水捕捞群众运动。（附图片）
