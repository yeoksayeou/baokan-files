    Latecomers Catch Up
    Newly Built Universities in Guangdong Rapidly Grow
    (Our dispatch) Guangzhou – In the Great Leap Forward last year, Guangdong Province established thirty-six new institutions of higher learning, including provincial, Guangzhou municipal, and special district-run comprehensive universities, as well as higher vocational schools and specialized colleges of various types, such as engineering, agriculture, medicine, and teacher training. After a year of effort, these schools have now become an important force in the nation's cultivation of talent for various construction endeavors. These schools now meet the several conditions proposed by the central government for newly built institutions of higher learning, namely, that students have a cultural level equivalent to high school graduation, that they adopt the teaching plans and courses of institutions of higher learning, that the length of study meets the regulations of institutions of higher learning, and that they are equipped with a certain number of full-time teachers. Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, these schools have resolutely implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, adhered to the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily, and achieved remarkable results in political and ideological education, teaching, school construction, and scientific research. Jinan University, which bears the primary responsibility for cultivating overseas Chinese students, has, in just one year since its establishment, become a comprehensive university of considerable scale, with seven departments, fourteen specialties, and more than 1,600 students, while also achieving significant results in teaching and scientific research. Taking the overseas Chinese students, who account for 65% of the school's population, as an example, although many of them face more difficulties in teaching and learning due to the differences between education abroad and in China, they have achieved excellent academic results. For example, at the end of the last academic year, 21 out of 31 overseas Chinese students in the Chinese department had excellent grades. Among the 285 students studying in the overseas Chinese preparatory course, 141 were directly promoted to undergraduate studies at the university without having to take an exam due to their good academic performance. The teachers and students of the university have also completed more than 200 scientific research projects in conjunction with productive labor. Among them, the research on the artificial spawning and incubation of silver carp, completed by Liao Xianghua, deputy director of the Department of Aquaculture, in cooperation with the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the research on the synthesis of new drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis by Lu Qirong, deputy director of the Department of Chemistry, are both valuable achievements. The South China Institute of Chemical Technology, established last year on the basis of the papermaking and chemical engineering departments of the South China Institute of Technology, now has 3,000 students. Because they have resolutely implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, the students' political and academic quality has greatly improved. The more than 200 graduating students who graduated this summer were not only able to happily accept organizational assignments, but also, as a result of participating in productive labor over the past year, produced high-quality graduation designs and dissertations. For example, the students majoring in rubber engineering completed their graduation design at the Beijing Rubber Industry Research Institute for more than three months, including various designs such as the overall layout of the factory and material balance, and passed the defense. Of the 24 graduating students, 21 were highly praised by the design institute for their excellent performance. Due to the increasing consolidation of newly built institutions of higher learning, the current number of students enrolled in various schools has reached more than 16,000, accounting for 47% of the total number of students in institutions of higher learning in the province.
    The reasons for the consolidation of newly built institutions of higher learning in Guangdong Province, in addition to the great enthusiasm of the teachers and students of various schools and the favorable conditions of the relatively developed secondary education in Guangdong Province, which guarantees the cultural level of the students admitted, are also due to the following reasons: When establishing the schools, relatively full consideration was given to the conditions that needed to be solved most, such as equipment, school buildings, and teachers. Twenty-three of the thirty-six schools were established by "putting a hat" on well-established secondary vocational schools and high schools. This "putting a hat" method could be implemented because these secondary schools had school buildings and equipment, high schools had teachers of basic courses, and secondary vocational schools had more teachers of professional courses. After developing into institutions of higher learning, it was only necessary to supplement new teachers, improve the original teachers, and supplement equipment on the original basis. Another part of the schools was developed from some departments and specialties split off from old institutions of higher learning. The establishment of schools in this way also had a certain foundation in terms of manpower and material resources, and there were fewer difficulties.
    The concern and attention of party committees at all levels is the key to running newly built institutions of higher learning well. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Higher Education have given much guidance and assistance to the newly built institutions of higher learning, and have given guidance through meetings and other forms on issues such as the establishment of majors in various schools, the formulation of teaching plans, and the implementation of educational policies. At the same time, they have also organized old schools to introduce teaching experience, organized teaching inspections, etc., to solve their difficulties and problems in teaching; they have also provided much assistance in terms of manpower and material resources. Last year and this summer, more than 400 college graduates have been assigned to Guangzhou and new colleges and universities in special districts to serve as teachers. The Communist Party Committees of the various special districts also attach great importance to the work of the newly built institutions of higher learning. Many prefectural committees have assigned members of the prefectural committee, deputy secretaries, and ministers to serve as leading cadres of the newly built institutions of higher learning. Many prefectural committees have established leading groups or party committees for institutions of higher learning to strengthen the leadership of various institutions of higher learning.
    The support and assistance of old institutions of higher learning have played a great role in running newly built institutions of higher learning well. Many old schools, such as Zhongshan University, South China Agricultural College, and Zhongshan Medical College, have overcome their own difficulties, transferred old teachers to support the new schools, and at the same time, in the heavy teaching tasks, extracted manpower to train teachers for the new schools. The old schools have also adopted many methods to help the new schools improve their teaching work. Old schools such as South China Normal College and South China Institute of Technology have held collective lesson preparation meetings with new schools of the same type during the summer and winter vacations last year and this year, and teachers from the new schools have jointly studied the teaching and tutoring of various courses to help the new schools prepare for the next academic year or semester, and solve the problem of the new school teachers' lack of teaching experience.

    后来者迎头赶上
    广东新建的高等学校迅速成长
    本报讯　去年大跃进中，广东省共新建高等学校三十六所，包括省属和广州市、各专区举办的综合大学和工、农、医、师范等各种性质的高等专科学校和专门学院。这些学校经过一年来的努力，现在已成为国家培养各项建设人材的一支重要力量。这些学校现在都符合中央提出的关于新建高等学校应该具备的几个条件，即学生都具备有高中毕业的文化程度，采用高等学校的教学计划和课程，修业年限符合高等学校的规定，配备有一定数量的专职教师。这些学校在各级党委的领导下，坚决贯彻执行了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，坚持勤俭办学的原则，在政治思想教育和教学、学校的建设以及科学研究工作上，都取得了显著的成绩。担负着培养华侨学生主要责任的暨南大学，创办不过一年，已成为设置了七个系、十四个专业和预科，拥有学生一千六百多人的具有规模的综合大学，同时在教学和科学研究工作上取得了显著成绩。以占该校65％的华侨学生为例，许多人虽然由于国外的教育情况同国内有所差别，教师进行教学和他们在学习上遇到的困难一般较多，但却取得优良的学习成绩。例如，上一学年结束时，中文系三十一个华侨学生中，有二十一人是成绩优良的。在华侨预科学习的二百八十五名学生中，有一百四十一名由于学习成绩好，不用通过考试就直升该校本科学习。该校师生还结合生产劳动，完成了二百多项科学研究项目。其中如水产系副主任廖翔华和中国科学院水生生物研究所合作完成的鲢鱼人工产卵孵化的研究，和化学系副主任陆启荣关于治疗血吸虫病新药合成的研究等，都是很有价值的成果。去年在华南工学院的造纸、化学两系的基础上建立起来的华南化工学院，现在已有学生三千人，他们由于坚决贯彻了教育与生产劳动结合的方针，学生的政治和学习质量大大提高。今年暑期毕业的两百多名毕业学生，不仅能够愉快地服从组织分配，而且由于一年来参加生产劳动的结果，作出了质量良好的毕业设计和毕业论文。如橡皮工学专业毕业学生在北京橡胶工业研究院进行了三个多月的毕业设计，其中有工厂的总平面布置、物料平衡等各项设计，并通过了答辩。二十四个毕业学生中，就有二十一个由于成绩优良，得到设计院的好评。由于新建高等学校的日益巩固，目前各校的在学学生人数已达一万六千多人，占全省高等学校学生人数的47％。
    广东省新建高等学校获得巩固的原因，除了各校师生的干劲很大，和由于广东省的中等教育较发达，录取学生的文化水平有保证的有利条件以外，还由于以下的几个原因：在创办的时候，比较充分地考虑到建校最需要解决的设备、校舍、教师等条件。三十六所学校中有二十三所是由条件较好的中等专业学校和高中“戴帽子”建立起来的。这种“戴帽子”的方法可以实行，是因为这些中等学校都具备有校舍、设备，高中有基础课教师，中等专业学校的专业课教师较多，发展为高等学校后只需在原有基础上补充新教师，提高原有教师，补充设备就可以了。还有一部分学校是从老高等学校分出一些系、科，在这些系、科的基础上发展起来的，这样建立起来的学校，在人力、物力上也有一定的基础，困难较少。
    各级党委的关怀重视是办好新建高等学校的关键。中共广东省委和广东省高等教育局对新建高等学校曾给予许多指导和帮助，对各校的专业设置、教学计划的制订以及教育方针的贯彻等问题上，都曾通过会议等形式给予指导，同时又组织老校介绍教学经验，组织教学视察等，解决他们在教学上的困难和问题；在人力和物力上，也给予许多帮助。去年和今年暑期，分配到广州市和专区新建高等学校担任教师的高等学校毕业生已有四百多人。各专区的中共地委对新建高等学校的工作也非常重视。许多地委都配备地委委员、副书记、部长作新建高等学校的领导干部。许多地委都成立了高等学校领导小组或高等学校党委以加强对各高等学校的领导。
    老高等学校的支援和帮助对办好新建高等学校起了很大作用。中山大学、华南农学院、中山医学院等许多老校都曾克服本身的困难，调出老教师支援新校，同时在繁重的教学任务中，抽出人力为新校培养师资。各老校还采用许多方法帮助新校提高教学工作。华南师范学院、华南工学院等老校在去年和今年的暑假、寒假，都曾分别和同一类性质的新校举行集体备课会议，和新校教师共同研究各门课程的教学和辅导问题，帮助新校作好下一学年或学期的教学工作准备，和解决新校教师教学经验不足的问题。
