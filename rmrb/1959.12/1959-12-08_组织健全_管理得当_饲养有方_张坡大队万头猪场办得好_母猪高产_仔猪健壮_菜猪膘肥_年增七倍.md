According to the Henan Daily: The Zhangpo Brigade of the Guqiang People's Commune in Shangshui County has an exceptionally well-run 10,000-pig farm. Every market pig is fat and strong, the sows have no empty pregnancies, average litter size is ten piglets, and all piglets survive. In the past year, they sold 1,874 fat pigs to the state and supported fraternal communes and brigades with a batch of piglets. The farm currently has a stock of more than 6,100 pigs, an increase of more than sevenfold compared to October of last year.

How did this farm achieve such great results? First, they carefully selected and strengthened the political and ideological education of the breeding and management personnel. Among the 125 breeding and management personnel in the entire farm, poor and lower-middle peasants account for more than 90%, and party and league members account for 20%. In order to strengthen the political and ideological education of the breeding and management personnel, the party branch established a breeding staff red and expert school, with classes for two hours every night, learning politics, culture and pig raising knowledge. At the same time, the whole farm carried out a six-competition campaign of "comparing pig fatness, comparing reproduction, comparing epidemic prevention, comparing manure accumulation, comparing drive, comparing inventions and creations." Under the slogan of "one person becomes five people" (feeder, epidemic prevention worker, mating worker, midwife, feed processing worker) put forward by the party branch, a learning and competition upsurge to become a versatile person was set off. Seventy-six people in the whole farm have reached the "five-worker" standard, and all the breeding staff have removed their illiteracy labels.

Secondly, in the breeding management work, they have explored a relatively sound organizational system over the past year. The entire farm has three fields, under which there are five sections including breeding, epidemic prevention, reproduction, feed processing, security and a feed field planting professional team. The pigs are managed in groups and raised separately: the pigs are divided into four groups: sows, market pigs, piglets, and breeding pigs, and each group is a breeding team; Each pig group is classified into circles and troughs according to size, strength, eating speed, and personality. The field implements six fixings for the feeders, namely: fixed pens, fixed number of heads, fixed feed, fixed fatness, fixed tools, and fixed work points. Those who raise sows also have fixed pregnancy rate, reproduction rate, and survival rate. At the same time, award and punishment standards are stipulated. In feeding, the methods of fixed time, fixed quantity, three additions, three no feedings and six cares are adopted. Fixed time means feeding twice a day in winter, three times a day in summer, and grazing in spring and autumn; fixed quantity means feeding 4-6 catties of processed feed per head per day for pigs under 100 catties, and 8 catties of processed feed per head per day for pigs from 100 to 200 catties, and increasing or decreasing accordingly for other large and small pigs, and reducing feed accordingly during the grazing season; three additions means adding frequently and adding less when feeding, and adding more after eating; three no feedings means: not feeding if the feed is not processed, not feeding if it is not clean, and not feeding if it is not time; six cares means: giving special care to sick pigs, weak pigs, disabled pigs, pregnant pigs, newly released piglets, and timid pigs, increasing refined feed or feeding in single troughs. In the management of feed processing, they promoted the combination of flowers and grass and did not feed single grass; they fed fermented feed in summer, added more water; they fed cooked feed in winter, which should be hot and thick. And according to the nutritional needs of various pigs, the feed processing room prepares different feeds to ensure the needs of all kinds of pigs. Therefore, this farm has achieved fat meat for market pigs, more milk for sows, and piglets generally weighing 18 catties at one month old, and eliminated the phenomenon of fat loss after release from the circle.

Regarding the source of feed, in addition to collecting wild feed and distributing agricultural by-products by the production team in proportion, they also opened up 200 acres of feed fields, cultivated 180 acres of aquatic plants, and established a feed base. In the second half of this year, they have harvested 50 acres of melons, vegetables and beans. Thirteen acres of land are planted with dwarf gourds, millet and vegetables mixed together, with a single yield of more than 40,000 catties per mu. Now they are also planting 50 acres of alfalfa, 50 acres of winter vegetables, and 100 acres of wheat and beans mixed together.

In order to improve labor efficiency and reduce labor intensity, the staff of the entire farm launched a hot and enthusiastic technical innovation upsurge. Now they have realized water self-flow, vehicle transportation, warm cylinder feed processing, and semi-mechanized grass cutting and vegetable cutting. Greatly saving labor and improving working conditions.

Third, this pig farm grasped two links in the implementation of the self-breeding and self-raising policy:
(1) Actively select and retain sows and breeding boars. Adopting the method of selecting the good from the general and combining the good with the general, the number of sows has increased from 420 last year to 768, including 650 good white pigs; the number of breeding pigs has increased from 8 last year to 23, including 21 good Yorkshire and Ukrainian pigs. Next year, the entire farm can realize the improvement of pig breeds. (2) Improve mating and breeding technology. In addition to the comprehensive use of advanced experience such as double mating, re-mating, artificial insemination, and drug estrus, they also summarized a set of experiences in accurate mating, fetal protection, multiple births, and no deaths from practice. The main experience is: Sows must maintain second-class fatness during estrus and mating, and it is not easy to conceive if they are too thin or too fat; within two months of pregnancy, master the condition of fatness without rising, so as to avoid excessive fat and hurt the fetus; start adding feed to chase fatness after two months, and feed in a single circle after three months, stop grazing to prevent squeezing and miscarriage, and ensure that the piglets have sufficient nutrients; enter the breeding circle when they are about to give birth, and special personnel will take care of the delivery. At this time, the sow must be a first-class fatness with a lot of milk; feed more refined feed to the sow within 20 days after giving birth, and gradually reduce it after 20 days, so that it still maintains second-class fatness when it is re-mated after a full month. Piglets start to be taught to eat feed 20 days after birth. Strengthen the maintenance after leaving the circle, and make one litter in one circle to take care of their habits. Because of this method, empty pregnant sows have been eliminated, and the average litter size of sows in the entire farm is ten piglets; the survival rate of piglets reached 98% in the first half of the year and 100% in the second half of the year.

Fourth, one of the most important tasks of large pig farms is to do a good job in hygiene and epidemic prevention. This farm first established an epidemic prevention team, set up a medical room, equipped with five veterinarians and epidemic prevention workers, and imparted epidemic prevention and treatment knowledge to the breeders to realize "feeding and prevention integration." This farm also summarized the characteristics of the season and weather in which pigs are prone to disease, for example: pig plague is prone to be popular in spring and autumn; pigs are prone to heat in summer; pigs are prone to asthma in winter due to cold; continuous cloudy days or sudden climate changes are prone to stuffy circles, skin diseases or pig erysipelas, especially prone to cause the prevalence of white scours and paratyphoid fever in piglets. As long as we seize the measures of epidemic prevention, heat prevention, cold prevention, and rain prevention in a timely manner, we can prevent pigs from getting sick or getting sick less. In this regard, they paid special attention to doing the following four tasks: First, keep the pig farm and pens clean and hygienic, and do a good job in pig health care. Such as often feeding salt to increase the pig's appetite, feeding green ash water once a month for gastrointestinal disinfection, feeding mulberry bark, radish, and yangjinhua in winter to prevent asthma, feeding gypsum and mirabilite in summer to clear fire, feeding plantain, bamboo leaves, and willow leaves when the temperature is high, and feeding broom seedlings for dry feces, etc. Second, establish a strict epidemic prevention and disinfection system. Conduct epidemic prevention injections in spring and autumn every year, three injections for one pig to prevent hog cholera, swine fever and pig erysipelas; take rain and heat prevention measures in summer, and increase circle insulation equipment in winter. It is stipulated that small disinfection should be carried out three times a day, using lime to sprinkle the circle, and green ash water to brush the trough; large disinfection should be carried out once every seven days, using “666” to spray the circle and turn over the bedding grass. During the epidemic period, emergency blockade is implemented and grazing is stopped. Third, isolate and treat sick pigs. The pig farm has observation circles (pigs with diseases that have not been diagnosed are sent to the observation circle), treatment circles, and recuperation circles. Fourth, pay attention to science and also trust the masses. In pig epidemic prevention and treatment, they not only used scientific prescriptions, but also visited the masses, collected more than 40 folk prescriptions, and mobilized breeders to collect more than 100 kinds of native medicinal materials, more than 1,500 catties. Many pig diseases were cured with these folk prescriptions and free medicinal materials. The whole farm eliminated several major pig diseases such as pig plague, erysipelas, swine fever, encephalitis, and white scours in piglets in the first half of the year, and even the most troublesome asthma was eliminated in the second half of the year.

    组织健全　管理得当　饲养有方
    张坡大队万头猪场办得好
    母猪高产　仔猪健壮　菜猪膘肥　年增七倍
    据河南日报消息　商水县固墙人民公社张坡大队万头养猪场办得出色，头头菜猪肥壮，母猪没有空怀，平均每窝产仔猪十头，仔猪全部成活。一年来卖给国家肥猪一千八百七十四头，支持兄弟社、队一批仔猪。现在全场存栏猪六千一百多头，较去年10月增长七倍多。
    这个场是怎样取得这样大成绩的？首先是对饲养管理人员进行了认真的挑选和加强了政治思想教育。全场一百二十五名饲养管理人员中，贫农和下中农占90％以上，党、团员占20％。党支部为加强饲养管理人员的政治思想教育，举办了饲养员红专学校，每天晚上上课两小时，学习政治、文化和养猪知识。同时，全场开展了“比猪膘、比繁殖、比防疫、比积肥、比干劲、比发明创造”的六比竞赛。在党支部提出的“一员变五员”（饲养员、防疫员、配种员、接生员、饲料加工员）的口号下，掀起了争当多面手的学习和竞赛高潮，全场已有七十六人达到“五员”标准，全部饲养人员都摘掉了文盲帽子。
    其次，对饲养管理工作，一年来摸索出了一套比较健全的组织制度。全场共设三个场，下设饲养、防疫、繁殖、饲料加工、保卫等五股和一个饲料田种植专业队。对猪采取分群管理、分类饲养的方法：把猪分为母猪、菜猪、仔猪、种猪四群，每群为一个饲养小组；各猪群根据大小、强弱、吃食快慢、性格好坏，分类定圈、定槽喂养。场对饲养员实行六定，即：定圈舍、定头数、定饲料、定膘情、定工具、定工分。饲养母猪的还有定怀胎率、繁殖率、成活率。同时，规定奖惩标准。在喂养上采取定时、定量、三添、三不喂和六照顾的办法。定时即冬季每天喂两次，夏季每天喂三次，春秋放牧；定量即百斤以下的猪每头每天喂加工饲料四至六斤，百斤至二百斤的猪每头每天喂加工饲料八斤，其余大小猪酌情增减，放牧季节相应减少饲料；三添即喂时勤添，少添，吃完再添；三不喂即：饲料不加工不喂，不清洁不喂，不到时间不喂；六照顾是：对病猪、瘦弱猪、残废猪、怀胎猪、刚出圈仔猪、胆小猪分别照顾，增加精料或单槽拌食。在饲料加工管理上，推广了花草搭配，不喂单样草；夏季喂发酵的饲料，多加水；冬季喂煮熟饲料，要热要稠。并且根据各种猪的营养需要，饲料加工房准备了不同的饲料，保证了各类猪的需要。因此，这个场做到了菜猪肉肥，母猪奶多，满月仔猪一般体重十八斤，并消灭了出圈掉膘现象。
    关于饲料来源，他们除采集野生饲料和由生产队按比例分配农作物副产品外，还开辟了二百亩饲料田，培养了一百八十亩水面的水生植物，建立了饲料基地。今年下半年已收获五十亩地的瓜、菜和豆类。有十三亩地是采用矮瓜、米谷和菜混作，每亩单产四万多斤。现在又种苜蓿五十亩，冬菜五十亩，麦豆混作一百亩。
    为提高劳动效率，减轻劳动强度，全场职工开展了热火朝天的技术革新高潮。现已实现用水自流化、运输车子化、加工饲料暖缸化、铡草切菜半机械化。大大节省了劳力，改善了劳动条件。
    第三，这个猪场在贯彻执行自繁自养的方针中，抓紧了两个环节：
  （1）积极选留母猪和种公猪。采取普中选良、良普结合的办法，母猪由去年的四百二十头发展到七百六十八头，其中良种白猪六百五十头；种猪由去年的八头发展到二十三头，其中约克夏、乌克兰良种猪二十一头。明年全场即可实现生猪良种化。（2）改进配种繁殖技术。除全面运用双配、复配、人工授精、药物催情等先进经验外，还从实践中总结了一套配准、保胎、多生、不死的经验。主要经验是：母猪发情、配种期必须保持二类膘，太瘦太肥均不易受孕；怀胎两个月内，掌握膘情不上升，以免脂肪过多，伤胎化胎；两个月后开始加料追膘，三个月后单圈喂养，停止放牧，防止挤碰流产，保证仔猪有充足养分；临产时进繁殖圈，专人照顾接生，这时母猪必须是一类膘，奶汁多；母猪产后在二十天内多喂精料，二十天以后逐渐减少，以便到满月后再配种时，仍保持二类膘。仔猪出生二十天后开始教吃饲料，出圈后加强养护，并使一窝一圈，照顾习性。由于采取这种方法，消灭了空怀母猪，全场母猪平均每窝产仔十头；仔猪成活率上半年达98％，下半年达到100％。
    第四，大型猪场最重要的任务之一是做好卫生防疫工作。这个场首先建立了防疫组，设立医疗室，配备五名兽医和防疫员，并把防疫、治疗知识传授给饲养员，实现“饲防合一”。这个场还总结出猪易于发病的季节、天气等特点，例如：春、秋猪瘟易于流行；夏季猪易于受热；冬季易于受寒发生猪气喘；连阴天或气候突变容易闷圈，得皮肤病或猪丹毒，特别是易于引起仔猪白痢和副伤寒的流行。只要适时抓住防疫、防热、防寒、防雨等措施，就可使猪不生病或少生病。在这方面，他们特别注意作好了以下四项工作：第一，保持猪场、圈舍清洁卫生，做好生猪保健工作。如经常喂食盐增进猪食欲，一月喂一次青灰水进行肠胃消毒，冬季喂桑白皮、白萝卜、洋金花防止气喘病，夏季喂石膏、皮硝清火，温度高时喂车前子、竹叶、柳叶，屙干屎喂扫帚苗等。第二，建立严格的防疫和消毒制度。每年春、秋两季进行防疫注射，一猪三针，防止猪瘟、猪肺疫和猪丹毒；夏季采取防雨、防热措施，冬季增加圈舍保暖设备。规定三天一次小消毒，用石灰撒圈，青灰水刷槽；七天一次大消毒，用
  “六六六”喷撒圈舍，翻晒铺草。在疫情流行期，实行紧急封锁，停止放牧。第三，隔离治疗病猪。猪场设有观察圈（有病未确诊以前的猪送观察圈）、治疗圈、疗养圈。第四，重科学也相信群众。在生猪防疫和治疗中，既运用了科学验方，同时也访问群众，搜集单方四十多个，发动饲养员采集土药材一百多种、一千五百余斤，不少猪病就是用这些单方和不花钱的药材治好的。全场上半年即已消灭了猪瘟、丹毒、肺疫、脑炎、仔猪白痢等几种主要猪病，下半年连最缠手的气喘病也消灭了。
