　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 30th -- Tens of thousands of Tibetan, Han, and Hui people in Lhasa are joyfully celebrating the first New Year after Tibet's liberation.

　　The increasingly prosperous Lhasa market has been particularly lively recently. Tailor shops are rushing to make new clothes, food stores have added fried dough twists and sugary pastries, and the state-owned Lhasa Municipal Trading Company's department stores, grain stores, and street shops and stalls are crowded with people shopping for New Year goods. In the market, hadas and auspicious red silk and paper have become popular items.

　　The Lhasa Municipal Trading Company's stores display nearly a thousand kinds of goods popular with the Tibetan people. The styles and varieties of Tibetan boots, clothing, hats, aprons, printed cloth, and various foods have increased compared to the past. Since December 15th, the state-owned trading company has prepared large quantities of grain, tea, butter, and other items to meet the needs of the citizens. The supply of non-staple foods commonly used by Tibetan citizens during the festival, such as cigarettes, alcohol, sweets, walnuts, dried apricots, and black dates, has been increased.

　　On the main roads in the city and in front of various government buildings, colorful arches are being erected. Tibetan citizens, who never used to paste up couplets, are also actively preparing to make them. They are writing: "Never forget the Communist Party after liberation, always follow Chairman Mao" and "The three major feudal lords have been overthrown, the people are now masters of their own house."

　　The tragic scene of "the poor suffering through the festival as if facing a trial" is no longer visible. Several thousand unemployed people and beggars who wandered the streets of Lhasa before the rebellion have found jobs with the help of the government or settled in nearby rural areas. Hundreds of elderly, lonely, disabled, and sick people are living a carefree life with ample food and warm clothing in the welfare homes. Hundreds of tent-dwelling families have moved into comfortable houses. This year, they will all spend their first happy New Year.

　　On the eve of the New Year, Lhasa's appearance has been completely renewed. The entire city has launched a clean-up and hygiene campaign, with every household sprucing up to welcome the New Year. Garbage dumps and stinking ditches that had existed for centuries have been cleared, and bumpy streets have been repaired. Traces of the serf system society are being rapidly eliminated by the liberated people. Courtyards and streets formerly named after aristocratic families have been replaced by new street names and house numbers such as Democratic Road, Freedom Road, Unity Road, and Liberation Road. Hundreds of handicraft production mutual aid groups for ironwork, tailoring, transportation, and flour processing, as well as more than sixty people-run primary schools and residents' spare-time political and cultural schools, have also put up signs on the streets. Many new murals praising the new life have appeared in the streets and alleys.

　　Tibetan and Han workers who have already overfulfilled their 1959 production and construction tasks are now selecting advanced workers, holding victory celebration meetings, and pledge rallies, determined to achieve an even greater leap forward in Lhasa's production and construction in 1960.

　　The number of visitors to various parks has begun to increase. Lhasa's Tibetan opera troupe, Sichuan opera troupe, Henan opera troupe, various song and dance troupes, residents' amateur troupes, and various middle and primary schools are all stepping up preparations for New Year's performances. During the New Year, Norbulingka will hold a grand garden party and art performance.

　　迎接新生后第一个新年
    拉萨人民喜气洋洋
    新华社拉萨30日电　拉萨市数万藏、汉、回族人民，正喜气洋洋地迎接西藏新生后的第一个新年。
    日趋繁荣的拉萨市场上，近来更是活跃。缝纫店里在赶制新衣，食品店里新添了油果子和糖食糕点，国营拉萨市贸易公司的百货、粮食门市部和街上的商店、货摊，都拥挤着采办年货的人群。市场上，哈达和代表吉祥的红色绸布与纸张，成了畅销物品。
    拉萨市贸易公司的门市部里，陈列着近千种藏族人民喜爱的商品。藏靴、衣帽、围裙、花布和各种食品等，花色品种都比以前增多。从12月15日起，国营贸易公司已准备了粮食、茶叶、酥油等大批物品，满足市民需要。藏族市民在节日喜用的烟、酒、糖果、胡桃、杏干、黑枣等副食品，都增加了供应量。
    在市区的通衢要道上和各机关门前，正在搭扎彩门，从来不贴对联的藏族市民，也在积极准备制作对联。他们写着：“翻身不忘共产党，永远跟着毛主席”、“三大领主被打倒，人民当家作主人”。
    “穷人过节如过关”的惨景，再也看不到了。平叛前流浪在拉萨街头的几千个失业者和乞丐，都在政府的帮助下找到了职业，或在附近农村安了家，几百个孤老残病者无忧无虑地在教养院里，过着饱食暖衣的生活，几百户帐篷户都住进了舒适的房屋，他们今年都将度过有生以来第一个快乐的年节。
    在新年前夕，拉萨市面貌焕然一新。全市开展了一个清洁卫生运动，家家户户干干净净迎新年。千百年来的垃圾堆、臭水坑被清除了，坎坷不平的街道修平整了。农奴制度社会所遗留下的痕迹，都正在被翻身的人民迅速加以清除。过去以贵族的家族名称命名的院落和街巷，已被民主路、自由路、团结路、翻身路等等新的街名和门牌号数代替了，上百个铁业、缝纫、运输、面粉加工等手工业生产互助组，和六十多个民办小学、居民业余政治文化学校，也在各条街上挂起了牌子，街头巷尾出现了许多歌颂新生的新壁画。
    已经提前完成1959年生产建设任务的藏族和汉族的工人们，现在正在评选先进工作者，开祝捷大会、誓师大会，决心1960年在拉萨市的生产建设上，来一个更大的跃进。
    各个林卡里的游人已开始增加。拉萨的藏剧团、川剧团、豫剧团、各歌舞团、居民的业余剧团和各中、小学校，都在加紧准备新年演出节目。在新年期间，罗布林卡将举行盛大的游园会和文艺会演。
