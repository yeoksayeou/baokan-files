Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: In the current water conservancy construction movement in Henan Province, the work efficiency is steadily increasing due to the vigorous efforts of various localities in reforming tools. At the end of November, the average daily work efficiency of millions of laborers across the province increased from 1.1 cubic meters at the beginning of the month to 6.4 cubic meters. After the water conservancy movement in Nanyang Special District fully formed a high tide in early November, in less than a month, more than 570,000 pieces of advanced tools of various types were newly made and reformed. The average earthwork done by laborers at various water conservancy construction sites in the district reached more than 10 cubic meters per day. At the water conservancy construction sites in Nanyang, Dengxian, and Xinye counties, semi-mechanized construction has been basically achieved in the five processes of digging, loading, ramming, transporting, and unloading. On average, each of the 400,000 laborers in the three counties has one piece of advanced tool. The largest water conservancy project in Xuchang Special District, the Baiguishan Reservoir, has created and promoted more than 60 types of advanced tools, totaling more than 12,100 pieces, in the past ten months. The entire construction site has achieved cart transportation and semi-automatic loading and unloading, which has powerfully promoted the construction progress.

In the process of carrying out the high work efficiency movement, all localities have also attached great importance to the quality of the projects. In the construction process, Kaifeng, Xuchang, Nanyang, and other special districts have universally promoted the construction responsibility system of setting tasks, setting time, and setting quality, ensuring the progress and quality of the projects.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: Various localities in Anhui Province are carrying out mass water conservancy tool reforms, launching a high work efficiency movement in water conservancy construction throughout the province. Now, the average daily work efficiency of laborers doing earthwork at water conservancy construction sites across the province has increased to more than five cubic meters, an increase of 40% compared with the same period last year.

Anhui Province's tool reform work for water control this year started early and moved quickly, setting off a high tide of tool reform for water control in early October. By mid-November, various localities had reformed more than 1.8 million pieces of various sizes of water control tools. The creation and use of these advanced tools have greatly improved the work efficiency of water conservancy construction. For example, in Fuyang Special District, due to the creation and promotion of more than 730,000 pieces of advanced tools, the phenomenon of carrying by shoulder pole has been basically eliminated.

In winter water conservancy construction in Anhui Province, animal power and mechanical power are also used to improve work efficiency. The more than 40,000 heads of draught cattle used for water conservancy construction in Fuyang Special District can each work as much as four laborers. Many counties such as Lu'an, Guichi, Hanshan, Quanjiao, and Xuancheng have universally tried using hydraulic machinery. At the Ma'anshan Reservoir construction site in Zongyang County, Anqing Special District, using hydraulic power to pull a sheep horn roller is equivalent to the work efficiency of 1,200 laborers using rammers. At the Maya Reservoir construction site in Guichi County, three drainage and irrigation machines were tested to transport soil with windlasses, and each time they could transport more than 25 cubic meters of soil. The ropeway trolley transporter and crawler transporter adopted in Lu'an County achieved an efficiency of more than 30 cubic meters under the conditions of climbing a 12-meter slope and transporting a distance of 140 meters.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: In Hunan Province, the winter water conservancy projects are being carried out, and due to the full mobilization of the masses by the local party committees and the launching of a red flag competition centered on tool reform, a situation of high work efficiency and high quality has emerged from the beginning. As of November 19, more than 120,000 projects across the province had been completed, including 10,803 large, medium, and small reservoirs that were completed ahead of schedule. 38% of the total earth and stone work for the reservoirs has been completed. Xiangtan, Leiyang, Anren, Chenxian, Rugui, and other five counties that started work earlier have basically completed the water conservancy winter repair tasks originally scheduled for this year. This speed is the first in the history of water conservancy construction in Hunan. After inspection, most of the water conservancy projects completed in various places meet the quality requirements, and the individual projects with poor quality have also been improved in time.

In this winter's water conservancy construction, Hunan Province also paid attention to starting the main dam and canal projects at the same time to ensure complete projects and expand project benefits.

In winter water conservancy construction, various localities have fully mobilized the masses, relied on their own efforts, used local materials, and used earthen methods instead of foreign methods to solve the difficulties of lacking equipment and materials. According to incomplete statistics, the water conservancy construction sites across the province have produced more than 5,000 tons of cement using local methods, more than 1,000 tons of black powder for blasting, and 6 million dan of lime.

    治水工效节节上升
    河南平均工效月末比月初提高五倍
    安徽四十天改革工具一百八十万件
    湖南一万多座水库提前竣工质量好
    据新华社郑州讯　河南省在当前水利建设运动中，由于各地大抓工具改革，工效节节上升。11月末，全省数百万民工每人每天的平均工效已由月初的一点一立方米提高到六点四立方米。南阳专区水利运动从11月初全面形成高潮以后，不足一个月的时间，就新制和改制各种先进工具五十七万多件，全区各个水利工地民工每天做的土方平均达到十立方米以上。南阳、邓县、新野三个县的各个水利工地，在挖、装、夯、运、卸五道工序上，已基本实现了半机械化施工，三个县的四十多万名民工，平均每一个多人就有一件先进工具。许昌专区最大的水利工程——白龟山水库，十个月来已创制和推广各种先进工具六十多种、一万二千一百多件，全工地已经实现了运土车子化、装卸半自动化，有力的促进了施工进度。
    各地在开展高工效运动中，还都非常重视工程的质量。开封、许昌、南阳等专区在施工中普遍推行了定任务、定时间、定质量等施工责任制度，保证了工程的进度和质量。
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽省各地大搞群众性的治水工具改革，在全省开展兴修水利的高工效运动。现在，全省水利工地民工做土方的平均日工效已提高到五立方米以上，比去年同期提高了40％。
    安徽省今年的治水工具改革工作，动手早、行动快，10月上旬便掀起治水工具改革的高潮。到11月中旬，各地已改革各种大小治水工具一百八十多万件。这些先进工具的创制和使用，大大提高了兴修水利的工效。如阜阳专区由于创制和推广了七十三万多件先进工具，基本上消灭了挑抬现象。
    安徽省在冬修水利中，还采用畜力和机械动力来提高工效。阜阳专区用于水利建设的四万多头耕牛，每头工作能力可抵四个劳力。六安、贵池、含山、全椒、宣城等许多县普遍试用了水力机械。安庆专区的枞阳县马鞍山水库工地，用水力牵引一个羊角碾，等于一千二百个劳力的硪工工效。贵池县马牙水库工地试验用三部排灌机械带辘轳绞关运土，每次能运土二十五立方米以上。六安县采用的绳索滑车运土机和履带式运土机，在爬坡十二米，运距一百四十米的情况下，工效达到三十立方米以上。
    据新华社长沙讯　湖南省冬季兴修水利工程，由于各地党委充分发动群众，开展了以工具改革为中心的红旗竞赛，一开始就出现了高工效、高质量的局面。到11月19日为止，全省已有十二万多处工程竣工，其中提前完工的大中小型水库有一万零八百零三座。整个水库土石方任务已完成38％。开工较早的湘潭、耒阳、安仁、郴县、汝桂等五县都已基本上完成了今年原订的水利冬修任务。这种速度在湖南水利建设史上还是第一次。各地已经完工的水利工程，经过检查，绝大部分都合乎质量要求，个别质量较差的，也及时作了改进。
    湖南省今冬水利建设还注意了主坝与渠道工程同时开工，确保工程成套，扩大工程效益。
    在冬修水利中，各地用充分发动群众，自力更生，就地取材，以土代洋的方法，解决了缺乏器材物资的困难。据不完全统计，全省各水利工地土法制造水泥五千多吨，爆破用的黑火药一千多吨、石灰六百万担。
