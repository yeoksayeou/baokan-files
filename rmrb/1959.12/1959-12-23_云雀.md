　　The Lark
　　Lǔ Yànzhōu
　　Have you ever heard the song of the lark in the sky?
　　It is a common bird, and its song can be heard in the mountains and plains.
　　When the spring breeze turns the earth green, you carry your hoe, face the bright sunshine, and walk to the fields with the villagers, chatting and laughing, and swing your hoe. Suddenly, a clear and sweet voice rings above your head. The voice becomes higher and higher, sometimes slow and sometimes fast, sometimes like a silver bell, and sometimes like a reed pipe. At this time, you will definitely raise your head, put your hand on your brow, and look for the singing bird; but all you see is the blue sky and a few thin white clouds... Although you didn't find its trace, your face will definitely be full of smiles. Wipe your sweat and swing your hoe harder.
　　This is the lark.
　　However, what I want to talk about is not this lark in the sky. I want to talk about a lark girl.
　　Before liberation, I knew a little girl on Fangniu Hill: yellow hair, with sores growing inside her hair, wearing a torn dress that reached her knees, wearing torn shoes that exposed her heels, her arms and legs were as thin as hemp stalks, her face was black and gray, leaving only two big eyes that rolled around. She carried a broken basket and held a rusty shovel, digging wild vegetables on the barren hill.
　　The peach blossoms withered and bloomed again, the stream in front of our house rose and fell again. Ten years or so have passed, and the eastern sky is bright. In the third year after liberation, I returned to my hometown.
　　It was also a spring.
　　I spent a few ordinary days and nights in my hometown. One day, the head of the mutual aid team at the time wanted to take me to see the newly planted orchard, so I went to this barren hill again.
　　The weeds on the hill are gone! The graves have been moved away, and in their place are young seedlings of sturdy fruit trees.
　　As I was stroking the tender leaves of the seedlings, singing suddenly floated up from the bottom of the hill. The loud singing made all the birds stop singing. At first, I could hear where the singing came from, but later the singing became louder and louder, and it was impossible to tell where it was coming from. One moment it seemed to be coming from the front, the next moment it seemed to be coming from behind, the next moment it seemed to be coming from the sky. Gradually, it felt like the whole hill and garden were full of singing.
　　The singing had stopped for half a day, and I could still hear the beautiful sound in my ears.
　　I was stunned. How could there be such a good voice! The old uncle who was with me smiled, "Don't you know? This is our famous Lark Girl. She has also participated in performances in the city!"
　　Who is the Lark Girl?
　　Just as I was wondering, four or five girls ran up from below, the leader wearing a floral jacket, with two long braids, black hair, a white face, two big bright and black eyes full of smiles, and two dimples on her cheeks!
　　The old uncle pointed and said, "That's her! Weren't you often together when you were little?"
　　I couldn't remember who she was. But this girl was natural, she smiled and said, "I can still recognize you, how can't you recognize me? I'm Xiao Ling!"
　　Heavens! She is that yellow-haired girl. Now, now she has become the Lark Girl! That night I couldn't sleep, and I got up and wrote a poem, not for her but for our Party and leader Chairman Mao.
　　In the spring of 1957, I went back again.
　　That day I got lost (because my hometown had changed too much), and accidentally went to someone's house to stay overnight. This family had a lot of children, all shoulder to shoulder. A woman, dressed casually, with messy hair, looked like a woman in her thirties. When I went, she was busy fetching water, lighting the fire, washing rice, and cooking; and at the same time, she was busy coaxing the children. The older children hummed, the younger children cried, coaxing this one, that one cried... When she looked up and saw me, I was shocked. The Lark Girl of a few years ago had become a busy old woman!
　　I left her with a heavy heart.
　　Later, after another time, it was this spring. My hometown has already established a people's commune.
　　I was helping to pick peaches in an orchard of our hometown commune. This orchard was on the hill I mentioned above. Now the commune has built a glass-house laboratory here, and many houses have also been built next to it, which are the canteen, nursery, night school, club, and houses of the orchard professional team. Each family has two or three rooms, all with white walls and glass windows, sitting on the colorful hill, so beautiful.
　　As we were picking peaches, singing rang out from below again. What a familiar song! When the commune members heard the singing, they immediately shouted, "The Lark is here!"
　　"The Lark?" I suddenly thought of the Lark Girl. Could it be her? Impossible, although she, like many women, has been freed from heavy housework by the commune, and has gained the joy of a thorough liberation, but she is no longer a young girl.
　　The girls followed the singing and sang along. Then a man jumped out of the forest, and he sang alone with the singer below. Everyone else stopped, clapping their hands and laughing: "Good! Husband and wife singing together, let's see if you husband can sing better than your wife."
　　After singing a few songs, the husband lost, and the singer below ran up, with long braids, black hair, big eyes, a rosy face, and two big dimples. I almost cried out, if it wasn't her, who would it be, it's her! It's the living Lark Girl. All the traces of the years etched on her face have disappeared. She is still the same as I saw her that year when I saw the young fruit tree seedlings!
　　She saw me and smiled happily. At noon, she, her lover, and I, and her children who had returned from the nursery, took food together in the canteen and surrounded a table in the new house, eating a fragrant and sweet lunch.
　　When the children hopped and sang to the nursery, and the husband and wife walked shoulder to shoulder to the glass house, in the sunny apple orchard, I heard the singing of the lark in the sky.
　　Then the Lark Girl also opened her mouth.
　　The lark in the sky and the lark on the ground sang to each other, but somehow, the singing of the lark in the sky disappeared quickly; and on the ground, in the fragrant orchard, the singing rang out everywhere, singing higher and higher.

　　云雀
　　鲁彦周
    你听见过天上的云雀的鸣声没有？
    这是种常见的鸟，山间平原都能听到它的鸣声。
    当春风吹绿大地的时候，你扛着锄，迎着灿烂的阳光，和老乡们一起说笑着走下田地，挥起锄头。忽然在你的头上响起了清脆的甜美的声音，这声音一阵高似一阵，忽而缓忽而急，一会儿像银铃，一会儿又像笙簧，这时你一定会抬起头，把手放在眼帘上，看看这只歌唱的鸟在哪；可是你看到的只是碧蓝碧蓝的天空，几片薄薄的白云……，虽然你没有找到它的踪迹，你脸上一定也会充满笑意，拭拭汗，加紧挥起锄头。
    这便是云雀。
    然而我要说的并不是这种天上的云雀。我要说的是位云雀姑娘。
    解放以前，我在放牛岗上认得一位小姑娘：黄头发，头发里面还长着疮，穿着长到膝盖的破衣服，穿着露了脚后跟的破鞋，两条胳膊两条腿都瘦的像麻秸，脸上一块黑，一块灰，只剩下两只大眼，滴溜溜的转。她提着一个破篮子，拿着一个锈铲子，在荒岗上挖野菜。
    桃花谢了又开了，我们家门前的溪水落了又涨了，十来个年头过去了，东方的天空亮了。我在解放后的第三个年头又回到了家乡。
    那也是一个春天。
    我在家乡欢度了几个平常的白天和夜晚。有一天，当时的互助组长要带我去看看新栽的果林，我又到了这个荒岗上。
    岗上的乱草不见了！坟滩迁走了，代替这些的是一株株茁壮的果树的幼苗。
    当我正在抚摸幼苗的嫩叶时，歌声忽然从山岗底下飘起来。嘹亮的歌声，使得一切鸟鸣都停止了。我先还听清歌声起自那方，后来歌声越来越响，而且分辨不出它是从哪方飘来的了，一忽儿像是来自前面，一忽儿又像来自背后，一忽儿像是来自天上，渐渐，只觉满岗满园都是歌声。
    歌声已经停了半天，我耳朵里还在响着这美妙的声音。
    我呆住了，怎么会有这样的好嗓子！陪我一道的老伯伯笑了，“你不知道吗？这是我们这里有名的云雀姑娘，她还到城里参加过会演呢！”
    谁是云雀姑娘？
    当我正疑惑的时候，底下跑上来四五个姑娘，为头的一个穿着一件花褂子，打了两条长辫子，乌头发，白脸庞，两只眼水灵灵的又乌又亮又大，满脸堆着笑，腮上出现两个酒涡！
    老伯伯指了指说：“就是她！你们小时候不是常常在一起吗？”
    我怎么也想不起来她是谁。倒是这姑娘洒脱，她笑着说：“我还能认出你，你怎么就认不出我来了？我是小灵呀！”
    天！她就是那个黄毛丫头。现在，现在却成了云雀姑娘了！当天晚上我怎么也睡不着，起来写了一首诗，不是为她而是为了我们的党和领袖毛主席。
    1957年春我又回去了一次。
    那天走迷了路（是因为家乡变化太大），偶然到一家人家去借宿，这家人家小孩特别多，都是挨肩的。一个妇女，穿的很随便，头发也很乱，看来像个三十多岁的妇女。我去时她正一面忙着打水，起火，淘米，做饭；一面忙着哄孩子。孩子们大的哼，小的哭，哄了这个，哭了那个……等她抬起头来看见我时，我吃了一惊，几年前的云雀姑娘变成一个忙碌的老太婆了！
    我怀着怏怏不乐的心情离开了她。
    以后，又过了一个时候，那是今年春天。家乡已经成立了人民公社。
    我在我们家乡公社的一个果园里帮助摘桃子，这果园就在我上面说过的那个岗上，现在公社已经在这里盖了玻璃房子的试验室了，旁边也盖了许多房子，是果园专业队的食堂、托儿所、夜校、俱乐部和房子，每家有两三间房，一色白粉墙玻璃窗，坐落在花花绿绿的岗上好不美丽。
    我们正在摘桃子的时候，歌声从底下又响起来了，多么熟悉的歌声呀！社员们听到这歌声，马上就嚷起来了：“云雀来了！”
    “云雀？”我蓦地想起了云雀姑娘，会是她吗？不可能，尽管她也会像许多妇女一样，公社使她摆脱了繁重的家务劳动，会使她得到了彻底翻身的快乐，可是她现在不是青年姑娘了。
    姑娘们跟着歌声唱起来，随后林中又跳出一个男子汉，他单独和底下唱歌的歌手对起歌来。其他人都停止了，拍着手笑道：“好！夫妻对歌，看你这个丈夫能不能对过老婆。”
    对了几首，丈夫输了，底下的歌手跑上来了，长辫子，乌头发，大眼睛，红扑扑的脸两个大酒涡。我差点叫出声来了，这不是她是哪个，是她！是活生生的云雀姑娘。岁月在她脸上刻下的痕迹全部消失了，她依旧是我那年在看果树幼苗时看到的那个模样！
    她看见我欢乐的笑起来。中午，她，她爱人，还有我，和她从托儿所回来的几个孩子，一道在食堂打了饭，在新房里围了一桌，吃了一餐又香又甜的午饭。
    当孩子跳着唱着上了托儿所，他夫妻俩并肩走向玻璃房去的时候，我在阳光灿烂的苹果林里，听到了天上的云雀的鸣声。
    接着云雀姑娘也开了口。
    天上的云雀和地上的云雀对歌起来了，可是不知怎么，很快天上的云雀的歌声没有了；而地上，在芳香的果园里歌声却遍地响起来，愈唱愈高。
