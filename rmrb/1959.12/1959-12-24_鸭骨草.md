　　Duck bone herb is an aquatic plant that grows year-round and is cold-resistant. It grows particularly quickly and luxuriantly in the warm season, with strong regenerative abilities.
　　Duck bone herb can grow on roadsides, in ditches, on field ridges, or in relatively moist muddy fields. It can be harvested from April to September each year, with the peak growing season around June, often growing in patches and heaps. Each person can manually pull or cut three hundred catties per day, with the highest reaching one thousand catties. After harvesting, it can be harvested again in about ten days.
　　The stems and leaves of duck bone herb are tender and can be chopped up and fed to pigs. Some people chop it up, blanch it in boiling water, and store it in jars; others dry it and store it. (Image attached)

　　鸭骨草
    鸭骨草为水生植物，全年都会生长，能耐寒；在温暖季节里生长得特别迅速，枝叶茂盛，再生力强。
    鸭骨草在路边、水沟、田埂边或比较潮湿的烂泥田中都能生长。每年4月到9月可收割，6月前后为茂盛期，往往成片成堆生长。每天每人可用手拔或刀割三百斤，最高的达一千斤，采集后隔十多天又可收割。
    鸭骨草茎叶幼嫩，切碎即可喂猪；也有把它切碎用开水烫一下，装缸贮存；也有晒干贮存的。（附图片）
