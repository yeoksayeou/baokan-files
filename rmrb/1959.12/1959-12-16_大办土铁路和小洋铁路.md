Since the Great Leap Forward, a new situation has emerged in railway construction. On the one hand, the construction of railway trunk lines laid with heavy-duty rails is accelerating. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, and the Beijing-Chengde Railway have been completed successively. The Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway has been opened to traffic in Xining. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is only over twenty kilometers away from being laid to Hami. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, the Chengdu-Kunming Railway, and the Neijiang-Kunming Railway are advancing steadily. On the other hand, the mass movement of vigorously developing native railways has been launched, and the construction of small western-style railways has also been put on the agenda. The so-called native railways are railways laid with rails cast from pig iron. A few are laid with iron-skinned wooden rails. These railways generally use gas engines, diesel engines, and locomotives converted from automobiles as traction power, and some use small steam locomotives. Compared with wooden rail transport, bamboo rail transport, and transport using human-pushed vehicles, winches, and hand-cranked vehicles, native railways have a much higher transport capacity. However, compared with railways laid with steel rails, these railways have relatively low load-bearing capacity, slow driving speed, and various simple equipment. The masses call them native railways to distinguish them from modern railways (which the masses call western-style railways). Since last year, when Meng County in Shanxi Province, and Weiyuan and Zhangye counties in Gansu Province started building native railways, many places have learned from this experience. This year, Zibo City in Shandong Province has built eleven native railways. Among the seventeen native railways planned to be built in Anhui Province, eight have been opened to traffic. The newly built native railway in Henan Province, from Luohe City through Yancheng County to Wuyang County, with a total length of 60 kilometers, has also been opened to traffic, and more native railways are under construction. The so-called small western-style railways are light rail railways. These railways are laid with steel rails and are modern. However, because they use light rails, their transport capacity is smaller than that of railways laid with heavy rails. The masses call them small western-style railways to distinguish them from railways laid with heavy rails. Some forest railways built in the past were of this type. Simultaneous development of steel rail railways and iron rail railways, and simultaneous development of heavy rail railways and light rail railways, is an extremely important measure to implement the general line of socialist construction and the "walking on two legs" policy of developing large, medium and small scale projects simultaneously, and combining western and native methods in railway construction.

Since liberation, the development of railway construction in our country has been extremely rapid. From 1950 to 1958, in nine years, a total of more than 16,500 kilometers of new and restored railway trunk lines, double tracks, branch lines, and enterprise dedicated lines were built across the country. This speed has never been seen in history. However, compared with the requirements of the rapid development of the national economy, railway construction is still insufficient. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, this situation has become more prominent. In the Great Leap Forward, with the vigorous development of industrial and agricultural production and construction, especially with the rapid growth of small and medium-sized enterprises like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, not only has the volume of transport on the original transport lines greatly increased, but also many places that did not often have transport tasks in the past now have frequent transport tasks, and the places where the transport volume was relatively small in the past have now seen their transport volume increase several times. Especially in those places where "small western-style clusters" of enterprises have moved towards normal production, the raw materials, materials, fuel, and products that need to be transported in and out every day are often more than thousands of tons. It is necessary to use transport tools with large transport capacity and fast speed, and railways are one of the main transport tools that best meet this requirement. Therefore, developing railway construction in a faster, better, and more economical way has become an urgent requirement in the economic life of various places.

How can we develop railway construction faster, better, and more economically? Just like developing other construction projects faster, better, and more economically, the key lies in implementing the general line of socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies. Railway construction requires a relatively long time, relatively large amounts of funds, and especially relatively large amounts of steel. This is a fact. Laying one hundred kilometers of railway, if using 38 kg or 43 kg of heavy rails, requires more than 10,000 tons of steel rails. This does not include the steel rails required for the construction of station lines to match this, and the steel required for the manufacture of locomotives and vehicles. Obviously, although our country's steel production has greatly increased in the past two years, it still cannot meet the needs of railway construction. If only heavy rail railways are built, the length of track laid will be limited. However, if we accelerate the construction of railway trunk lines laid with heavy steel rails while vigorously developing native railways and small western-style railways on branch lines, dedicated lines, in factories and mines, and on basic construction sites, this can make railway construction develop faster, better, and more economically. Native railways do not use steel rails at all. Pig iron from small blast furnaces can be used to cast iron rails of good quality and with considerable load-bearing capacity. In addition to small steam locomotives, the locomotives on native railways can also be modified using gas engines, diesel engines, and automobiles. At present, every province and region in the country except Tibet has a certain number of "small western-style cluster" iron and steel enterprises, which can produce a considerable amount of pig iron from small blast furnaces, and do not lack the ability to modify gas engines, diesel engines, and automobiles into locomotives. Although small western-style railways require steel rails, because they use light rails, they can also greatly save steel. Laying 24 kg of light rail per kilometer of railway can save more than 50 tons of steel compared to laying 38 kg or more of heavy rail. There are many more enterprises in our country that can produce light rails than those that can produce heavy rails. Some "small western-style cluster" iron and steel enterprises in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan and other places have also successfully trial-rolled light rails. Small western-style railways run light locomotives, which are of course much easier to manufacture than the heavy locomotives that run on large western-style railways, and require less steel. Building native railways and small western-style railways, steel rails can be used less or not at all, and the locomotive problem is also relatively easy to solve. What remains is the earthwork. Although earthwork accounts for a large proportion of the total project volume of railway construction, this part of the project can be completely solved by relying on local forces and the masses. Due to these favorable conditions, while accelerating the construction of railway trunk lines laid with heavy rails, vigorously developing native railways and small western-style railways can combine the strength of the central government and the strength of local governments, the strength of the state and the strength of the masses, and can mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties to develop railway construction faster, better, and more economically.

Of course, the transport capacity of native railways and small western-style railways is lower than that of large western-style railways, and the transport capacity of native railways is even much lower. However, compared with folk transport tools such as flatbed carts and horse-drawn carts, the transport capacity of native railways and small western-style railways is not lower by a little or much, but higher by a little or much. For example, the Xiejiabu No. 1 Mine in Huainan has three small coal pits, only 1.7 kilometers away from the railway station. In the past, even mobilizing 300 people to transport with flatbed carts was not enough. In just one month, the mining area had a backlog of more than 7,000 tons of coal. Later, a native railway was built, which could transport 1,000 tons of coal every day. Only 20 people replaced all the flatbed cart transport, completely meeting the transport needs of the three small coal pits. As for small western-style railways, their transport capacity is much higher than that of native railways. On branch lines, on dedicated lines, in factories and mines, and on basic construction sites, it is entirely possible to meet the transport needs by building native railways and small western-style railways. Of course, the transport volume will develop. But native railways and small western-style railways can also be developed and improved. In short, in a country like ours with a vast territory, backward transportation, and rapidly developing industrial and agricultural production, which is why the freight volume is growing rapidly, all transportation tools that can improve transportation efficiency, whether they are western or native, are good and should be promoted. Vehicle-ization, wood-rail-ization, and cableway-ization still need to be vigorously promoted, and native railways and small western-style railways should of course be vigorously developed.

Vigorously developing native railways and small western-style railways is also a new task, which needs to be especially grasped tightly. At present, the most important thing is to formulate plans for the construction of native railways and small western-style railways according to the needs of transport development, and to act quickly according to the plans. Native railways and small western-style railways are relatively formal transportation tools. They can be used for several years or even decades after they are built. Native railways should consider connecting with transportation trunk lines as much as possible, and small western-style railways must consider combined transportation with large western-style railways. Therefore, there must be plans. Construction based on plans can give fuller play to the role of native railways and small western-style railways. The plan can be made "from rough to fine," construction can be carried out while planning, and in the implementation of the plan, we can proceed from the easy to the difficult and from the short to the long in order to gain experience. However, when formulating and implementing plans, we must pay attention to concentrating our forces and first building those lines that are most urgently needed. The advantages of native railways and small western-style railways are very significant. At present, all parts of the country are very enthusiastic about vigorously developing native railways and small western-style railways. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. Because the construction of native railways and small western-style railways requires a relatively large investment of strength, especially the construction of small western-style railways, which requires strong support from the state in all aspects, we must use limited manpower and material resources in the most urgently needed places. Only by concentrating our forces and building in batches in stages can we achieve practical results faster.

Building more railways and fundamentally changing the backward state of transportation is a long-standing aspiration of the Chinese people and an important condition for the continued leap forward of our country's construction. Now we have successfully found a broad road to develop railway construction at a high speed by developing large, medium and small scale projects simultaneously, and combining western and native methods. Vigorously advancing along this road, railway construction will surely have faster development!

    大办土铁路和小洋铁路
    大跃进以来，铁路建设事业出现了一个新的形势。一方面，用重型钢轨铺设的铁路干线的建设速度正在加快，包兰铁路、黔桂铁路、京承铁路相继建成，兰青铁路已经通车西宁，兰新铁路只差二十多公里即将铺轨到哈密，川黔铁路、成昆铁路、内昆铁路正节节挺进；另一方面，大办土铁路的群众运动已经兴起，小洋铁路的建设也已经提到议事日程上来。所谓土铁路，就是用生铁铸造的铁轨铺设的铁路，也有少数是用铁皮木轨铺设的铁路。这种铁路一般都用煤气机、柴油机和汽车改制的机车作牵引动力，也有用小型蒸汽机车的。土铁路同使用人推车、绞盘车、手摇车的木轨运输、竹轨运输相比，运输能力要高得多；只是同用钢轨铺设的铁路相比，这种铁路承压能力比较低，行车速度比较慢，各种设备都比较简陋，群众管它叫做土铁路，以别于现代化的铁路（群众管它叫做洋铁路）。自从去年山西省的盂县，甘肃省的渭源、张掖等县兴建土铁路以来，许多地方都学习这个经验。今年山东省淄博市已经建成了十一条土铁路，安徽省计划兴建的十七条土铁路中已经有八条通车，河南省新建的从漯河市经过郾城县到舞阳县全长六十公里的土铁路也已经通车，还有更多的土铁路正在建设中。所谓小洋铁路，就是轻轨铁路。这种铁路是钢轨铺设的，是现代化的；只是用的是轻轨，运输能力比重轨铺设的铁路小一些，群众管它叫做小洋铁路，以别于用重轨铺设的铁路。过去修建的一些森林铁路，就是这种铁路。钢轨铁路和铁轨铁路同时并举，重轨铁路和轻轨铁路同时并举，这是在铁路建设事业中贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线和大中小并举、洋土并举等“两条腿走路”的方针的一项极为重要的措施。
    解放以来，我国铁路建设事业的发展是极其迅速的。从1950年到1958年的九年中，全国共新建、修复铁路干线、复线、支线和企业专用线共一万六千五百多公里。这样的速度是历史上从来不曾有过的。但是，同国民经济高速度发展的要求比较起来，铁路的建设仍然不敷需要；特别是大跃进以来，这种情况更加突出。在大跃进中，随着工农业生产和建设事业的蓬勃发展，特别是随着中小型企业如雨后春笋般地迅速成长，不仅原有的运输线路运量大增，而且许多从前还不经常有运输任务的地方现在经常有运输任务了，从前运量还比较小的地方现在运量几倍地增长了。尤其是在那些“小洋群”企业已经走向正常生产的地方，每天需要运进和运出的原料、材料、燃料和产品，动辄就在千吨以上，非要采用运量比较大、速度比较快的运输工具不可，而铁路则是最适合这种要求的主要运输工具之一，因而多快好省地发展铁路建设事业，就成为各地经济生活中的迫切要求。
    怎样才能多快好省地发展铁路建设事业呢？正同多快好省地发展其他建设事业一样，关键在于贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。铁路的建设需要比较长的时间，比较多的资金，特别是需要比较多的钢材，这是事实。铺设一百公里长的铁路，如果采用三十八公斤或四十三公斤的重轨，就需要一万吨以上的钢轨，至于与此相适应的站线建设所需要的钢轨和机车车辆制造所需要的钢材，还没有计算在内。很显然，我国的钢产量虽然在过去两年中很飞跃的提高，但仍然不能满足铁路建设的需要。如果只建设重轨铁路，铺轨的长度就要受到限制。但是如果在加速建设用重型钢轨铺设的铁路干线的同时，在支线上、在专用线上、在厂矿企业和基本建设工地上，大办土铁路和小洋铁路，这就能使铁路建设事业多快好省地发展。土铁路是完全不用钢轨的，用小高炉生铁完全可以铸造出质量良好、具有相当承压能力的铁轨来。土铁路上的机车，除了小型蒸汽机车外，也可以用煤气机、柴油机和汽车改装。现在，全国除西藏外各个省区都拥有一定数量的“小洋群”钢铁企业，都能生产相当数量的小高炉生铁，都不缺少把煤气机、柴油机和汽车改制成机车的能力。小洋铁路虽然要用钢轨，但由于用的是轻轨，也能大大地节省钢材。一公里铁路，铺设二十四公斤的轻轨，就能比铺设三十八公斤以上的重轨节省钢材五十吨以上。我国能生产轻轨的企业比能生产重轨的企业多得多，广东、江苏、四川、贵州、湖南等地的一些“小洋群”钢铁企业也已经试轧轻轨成功。小洋铁路行驶的是轻型机车，比起大洋铁路行驶的重型机车，制造起来当然容易得多，所需要的钢材也少得多。建设土铁路和小洋铁路，钢轨可以少用或不用，机车问题也比较容易解决，剩下的就是土石方工程了，土石方工程虽然在铁路建设的总工程量中土石方工程占有很大的比重，但是这部分工程完全可以依靠地方的力量和群众的力量来解决。由于上述这些有利条件，在加速建设用重轨铺设的铁路干线的同时，大办土铁路和小洋铁路，就可以把中央的力量和地方的力量、国家的力量和群众的力量结合起来，就可以调动各方面的积极因素，多快好省地发展铁路建设事业。
    当然，土铁路和小洋铁路同大洋铁路相比，运输能力是要低一些，土铁路甚至低很多。但是，拿土铁路、小洋铁路同平板车、骡马大车等民间运输工具相比，运输能力就不是低一些、低很多，而是高一些、高很多了。例如，淮南谢家集一矿有三个小煤井，距铁路车站只有一点七公里，过去动员三百人用平板车运输还运不过来。仅一个月的时间，矿区就积压了七千多吨煤。后来修建了土铁路，每天可以运出一千吨煤，仅用二十个人就代替了全部平板车运输，完全满足了三个小煤井的运输需要。至于小洋铁路，它的运输能力又要比土铁路高许多。在支线上、在专用线上、在厂矿企业和基本建设工地上，建设土铁路和小洋铁路是完全有可能满足运输需要的。当然，运量是会发展的。但土铁路和小洋铁路同样也是可以发展提高的。总之，在我们这样一个土地广阔、交通运输还落后、工农业生产又发展得很快因而运量增长得很快的国家里，一切能够提高运输效率的运输工具，不管它是洋的，还是土的，都是好的，都应该加以提倡。车子化、木轨化、索道化还需要大力推广，土铁路和小洋铁路当然更要大办。
    大办土铁路和小洋铁路还是一项新的工作，需要特别抓紧。目前最重要的是根据运输发展的需要制订建设土铁路和小洋铁路的规划，并且按照规划迅速行动起来。土铁路和小洋铁路都是比较正规的运输工具，建设起来后可以使用几年，甚至几十年，土铁路要尽可能考虑和运输干线的衔接，小洋铁路更必须考虑和大洋铁路的联运，因而必须要有规划。根据规划来进行建设，才能更充分地发挥土铁路和小洋铁路的作用。规划可以“由粗到细”地做，可以边规划边施工，在实现规划的时候也可以先易后难、先短后长，以便取得经验。但是，在制订和实施规划的时候，必须注意集中力量，首先建设那些最迫切需要的线路。土铁路和小洋铁路的优越性是非常显著的，现在各地对大办土铁路和小洋铁路的积极性都很高，这是很可喜的现象。由于土铁路和小洋铁路的建设毕竟需要投入比较大的力量，特别是小洋铁路的建设，还须要国家从各方面大力支援，因此，必须把有限的人力物力用在最迫切需要的地方。只有集中力量分期分批地建设，才能更快地收到实效。
    建设更多的铁路，根本改变交通运输的落后面貌，是我国人民由来已久的热望，也是我国建设事业继续跃进的重要条件。现在我们已经成功地找到了一条大中小并举、洋土并举的高速度发展铁路建设事业的宽广道路。沿着这条道路奋勇前进，铁路建设事业必将有更快的发展！
