    Romanov's Letter to Xu Xuehui
    Dear Xu Xuehui:
    I was deeply moved by the news of your heroic deeds in the "Outer Baikal Komsomolets Newspaper." You are a young girl, but in order to protect the people's property entrusted to you, you did not flinch in the face of despicable and wolfish bandits. With awareness, bravery, and fearlessness, you fought them. When you established this achievement, you were not thinking of yourself, but of your people. Your achievement and noble spirit are manifested here. Your behavior demonstrates the spiritual outlook of a true citizen of a socialist country. Therefore, it is no accident that the news of your meritorious service has aroused people's infinite and warm concern, and that they are proud of you—the outstanding daughter of the people. You care about the people and do not hesitate to sacrifice yourself; the people will never forget you. Among the Chinese people, you have hundreds of thousands of friends who care about you.
    When the news of your meritorious service reached us Soviets, you also have many sincere friends in the Soviet people. We are as proud of the achievements and merits of the Chinese people as we are of the achievements and merits of the Soviet people.
    Your eagerness to return to your work post deeply touched my heart. And I understand the difficulties involved better than others because I also lost both hands. It is possible to realize your wish, and I firmly believe this. The reason I believe this is that I myself have returned to my work post.
    Dear Xu Xuehui: I have been fitted with a pair of prosthetic hands. With these prosthetic hands, I can do some things for myself and complete various kinds of work without the help of others. For example: writing, typing, carpentry and fitting, painting and artistic creation, and other various activities. In this way, I became the director of the Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory. I designed a light and convenient everyday glove sleeve, which enables the disabled to serve themselves and do some light work.
    All of this, dear Xu Xuehui: gives me reason to firmly believe that I can help you return to a work post beneficial to society. I sincerely rejoice at this.
    If you need my help, please write to me, and I will do everything you need me to do.
    With deepest respect!
    Director of Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory
        A·A· Romanov

    洛玛诺夫给徐学惠的信
    亲爱的徐学惠：
    我在“外贝加尔共青团员报”看到了有关你的英雄事迹的消息，深为感动。你是一个年青的姑娘，但为了保护托付给你的人民财产，你在卑鄙的豺狼成性的匪徒面前毫不畏缩，以自觉、勇敢和无畏的精神同他们展开了搏斗。你在建立这一功勋时，想到的不是自己，而是自己的人民，你的功勋和高尚的气概，就在这里表现出来，你的行为说明了社会主义国家一个真正公民的精神面貌。因此，你的立功消息引起了人们对你无限的热烈关怀，和以你——人民优秀女儿为骄傲，那也就不是一件偶然事了。你关心人民，不惜牺牲自己，人民是绝不会忘却你的。你在中国人民中间，有着成千上万的关心你的朋友。
    你的立功的消息传到我们苏联人这里来时，你在苏联人民中间同样有很多热爱你的真挚朋友。中国人民的成就和功绩像苏联人民的成就和功绩一样，我们都引以自豪。
    你要回到工作岗位上去的迫切心情，深深地打动了我的心。而且其中的困难我比其他的人更为了解。因为我也失去了双手。你的愿望是有可能实现的，这点我非常相信，我相信的理由是我本人已经回到了劳动岗位。
    亲爱的徐学惠：我配上了一副假手，有了这副假手，我就有可能不需要别人帮助给自己做一些事情和完成各种各样的工作。例如：书写、打字、当木工和钳工，绘画和搞美术创作，以及其他各种各样的活动。这样，我当上了赤塔整形器材厂的厂长。我设计了一种既轻巧又方便的日用手套袖，这种套袖使残废者能够自己侍奉自己，并做一些轻微的工作。
    所有这些，亲爱的徐学惠：使我有理由深信，我能帮助你回到有益于社会的劳动岗位上来。对于这点，我由衷地感到高兴。
    如果你需要我的帮助，请写信来，我将做你需要我做的一切。
    向你深深致敬！
    赤塔整形器材厂厂长
        阿·阿·洛玛诺夫
