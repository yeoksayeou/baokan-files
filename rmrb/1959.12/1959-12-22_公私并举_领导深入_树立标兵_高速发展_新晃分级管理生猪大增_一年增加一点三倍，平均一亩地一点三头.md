This is a report from our Changsha Bureau on the 21st of December: In Sinhuang Dong Autonomous County, Hunan Province, the pig farming industry has achieved high-speed development. From the establishment of the communes last year to the end of November this year, the county developed a total of 521,449 pigs, an increase of 1.31 times compared to the 225,000 plus pigs before communization. The county currently has 224,065 pigs in stock, averaging 6.157 pigs per household and 1.31 pigs per mu of rice paddy.

The high-speed development of the pig farming industry has greatly promoted agricultural production. Over the past year, the county has accumulated more than 15 million dan of manure from pig farming, averaging 60 dan of pig manure per mu of cultivated land. Calculating one dan of pig manure as equivalent to one jin of chemical fertilizer, the county has effectively built seven thousand-ton chemical fertilizer plants. Due to the increase in refined fertilizer, investment in commercial fertilizer has been reduced, lowering agricultural production costs and increasing the multiple cropping index this year to 189%, a 40% increase compared to last year. The increase in the multiple cropping index has promoted the increase in grain crop production. Although the county encountered severe drought and insect pests this year, the total grain output still increased by more than 10% compared to last year. This year, the county provided 26,625 commercial fattened pigs to the state and 129,316 piglets to twelve neighboring friendly counties. The development of the pig farming industry has increased the actual income of commune members. This year, the total income from pig farming in the county was more than 6 million yuan, averaging more than 170 yuan per household.

The achievements of Sinhuang Dong Autonomous County are mainly due to the strong leadership of the Party, the superiority of the people's communes, the active and prioritized development of collective pig farming, the vigorous support of private pig farming, and the launch of a mass movement. The establishment of the people's communes last year created more favorable conditions for the high-speed development of pig farming, especially collective pig farming. Based on this situation, the Sinhuang County Party Committee further strengthened its leadership over the pig farming industry. Leading pig farming organizations were established at the county, commune, and brigade levels, and a secretary was assigned to each level, along with a group of full-time cadres to specifically manage this work. At the same time, the county focused on the central links in the development of collective pig farming and launched a mass movement. The County Party Committee established the Shaoxi Brigade of Fuluo Commune as a county-wide red banner for pig farming. Due to the development of collective pig farming, this brigade increased its pig production by 50% in one year, totaling more than 1,200 pigs. They had successful experiences in business management and solving feed problems. The County Party Committee convened a mass meeting of ten thousand people to repeatedly explain the benefits of pig farming using the facts of Shaoxi Brigade, disseminate advanced pig farming experiences, and criticize right-leaning conservative thinking. At the meeting, a resolution was made to develop pig production. Then, a swearing-in rally of more than 1,300 breeders' representatives was held to promote the glory of pig farming and raise the prestige of breeders. A mass movement to "learn from Shaoxi, catch up with Shaoxi, and surpass Shaoxi" was launched throughout the county. Two to three thousand people were mobilized every day. Within two months, more than 1,200 various breeding farms and more than 20,000 pigsties were rebuilt, repaired, and newly built, basically solving the problem of the lack of pigsties. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to widely use vacant land to expand the planting of feed crops, and more than 700,000 jin of various wild feeds were organized to be collected in the mountains. More than 30,000 mu of cultivated land was allocated as feed bases, and specialized feed teams were organized to operate, ensuring the supply of pig feed. In addition, the original pig farming experts were carefully reviewed, and a group of politically reliable and promising young people were selected as breeders, and specialized training classes were opened to train them in batches, establishing an excellent professional breeding team.

In April of this year, according to the principle of unified leadership and graded management of the people's communes, the County Party Committee implemented graded management of the county's 2,817 large and small collective pig farms: large-scale breeding farms were determined to be managed by the communes to demonstrate and explore advanced experiences in all aspects of collective pig farming; medium-sized breeding farms were managed by the brigades, focusing on the large-scale breeding of piglets; and canteens universally raised pigs, focusing on the development of fattened pigs to ensure internal allocation and external sales. At the same time, commune members with breeding conditions were vigorously supported to appropriately develop private pig farming. In this way, the pig farming industry has achieved high-speed and balanced development. Now, collective pig farming in communes, brigades, and canteens has reached 92.2% of the total number of pigs in the county; private pig farming has also reached more than 50% of the total number of farm households in the county.

In the process of developing collective pig farming, the County Party Committee, on the one hand, used the working methods of the mass movement to overcome the difficulties in developing collective pig farming, and on the other hand, adopted professional leadership, specialized feed land, and specialized breeding teams to gradually improve business management. Over the past year, a relatively complete set of pig farming methods has been explored: In terms of feeding management, breeding farms implement group management according to the different characteristics of sows, piglets, fattened pigs, and boars, and implement classified and fixed-stall feeding according to the size, strength, eating speed, and temperament of each pig group. Feed is rationally allocated according to the different needs of the pig growth and development periods, and feeding is carried out regularly and quantitatively. In particular, the feed required during the sow's non-pregnancy period, before and after pregnancy, and during farrowing is fed by special personnel in stages and quantitatively to ensure that the sow has more milk, the fattened pigs are full of meat, the piglets are strong, and the boars are in good condition. In terms of self-breeding, the method of "keeping all mothers and selecting later" was adopted. 50,925 heads of high-quality sows were selected successively. Artificial insemination and drug-induced estrus methods were used for double mating, re-mating, and special registration management to eliminate empty pregnant sows and increase the farrowing rate. In terms of epidemic prevention and hygiene, the principle of prevention is the main focus in terms of disease, and the principle of local methods is the main focus in terms of treatment. 280 folk veterinarians were organized to carry out mobile epidemic prevention throughout the county, dividing areas for contracting, regularly giving vaccinations, imparting experience and technology, and training breeders as epidemic prevention personnel. "Three diligences" (diligent sweeping, diligent bedding, and diligent manure removal) and "two disinfections" (pigsty disinfection and pig feed disinfection) were implemented in the farms, and regular epidemic prevention and hygiene work was carried out. The methods of isolating sick livestock and promoting local herbal medicine treatment were implemented, and the county basically prevented diseases such as swine fever and swine erysipelas. In terms of feed sources, measures were taken such as planting good feed land, collecting wild feed, using agricultural and sideline products as feed, reserving sufficient feed grain, and vigorously carrying out green storage, dry storage, and cooked storage of feed.

In order to further give play to the enthusiasm of collective pig farming in breeding farms, in terms of business management, Sinhuang County also universally implemented the method of taking the breeding farm as an independent accounting unit to participate in the unified distribution of communes and brigades. The brigade implements "three guarantees" and "one reward" for the breeding farm, namely guaranteed work, guaranteed output, and guaranteed cost, and rewards for overproduction; the breeding farm implements "six fixings" (fixed variety, quantity, fixed output value, fixed time, fixed fertilizer, fixed work points) and rewards for overproduction for breeders, implementing payment according to output and payment according to work, effectively improving the breeders' sense of responsibility and work enthusiasm. Technological innovation was carried out, and some breeding farms have implemented cart transportation of swill, continuous stove cooking of swill, self-flowing water, and automatic vegetable cutting using water power, greatly improving work efficiency.

Now, in order to ensure the completion of the task of developing an average of 25 pigs per household in 1960, the county is stepping up the storage of feed, expanding pig farms, selecting good breeds of sows, and carrying out a series of preparations such as large-scale tool reforms.

　　公私并举　领导深入　树立标兵　高速发展
    新晃分级管理生猪大增
    一年增加一点三倍，平均一亩地一点三头
    本报长沙21日电　湖南省新晃侗族自治县养猪事业获得了高速度的发展。从去年公社成立到今年11月底止，全县发展生猪五十二万一千四百四十九头，比公社化前二十二万五千多头增加一点三一倍。全县现有存栏猪二十二万四千零六十五头，平均每户六点一五七头，每亩稻田有猪一点三一头。
    养猪事业的高速度发展，对农业生产起了巨大的促进作用。一年来，全县养猪积肥一千五百多万担，平均每亩耕地有六十担猪粪，以一担猪粪折合一斤化肥计算，全县等于新建了七个千吨化肥工厂。由于精肥的增加，减少了商品肥料投资，降低了农业生产成本，使今年复种指数增加到189％，比去年提高了40％。复种指数的提高，促进了粮食作物的增产，今年虽然遇到了特大的旱灾和虫灾，粮食总产量仍比去年增加一成以上。全县今年为国家提供了二万六千六百二十五头商品肥猪，为附近十二个友邻县提供了十二万九千三百一十六头仔猪。养猪业的发展，增加了社员的实际收入，今年全县生猪一项收入就有六百多万元，每户平均一百七十余元。
    新晃侗族自治县这个成绩的取得，主要是由于党的坚强领导，人民公社的优越性，积极优先发展集体养猪，大力扶植私人养猪和大搞群众运动的结果。去年人民公社的建立为高速度发展养猪，特别是集体养猪创造了更加有利的条件。中共新晃县委根据这种情况，进一步加强对养猪事业的领导，县、公社和大队层层建立了领导养猪的机构，并分别确定了一个书记和配备了一批专职干部专管这项工作。同时，突出地抓住了发展集体养猪的各中心环节，大搞群众运动。县委树立扶罗公社绍溪大队为全县养猪红旗。这个大队由于发展集体养猪，一年增加生猪50％，共计一千二百多头；在经营管理、解决饲料方面，都有成功的经验。县委召开了全县万人大会，用绍溪大队的事实，反复说明养猪好处，传播养猪的先进经验，批判右倾保守思想。会上并作出了发展生猪的决议，接着又召开了全县一千三百多人的饲养员代表誓师大会，宣传养猪光荣，提高饲养员的声誉。全县掀起了“学绍溪、赶绍溪、超绍溪”的群众运动，每天出动两三万人，两月内改建、修建、新建各种饲养场一千二百多个，猪栏二万余间，基本上解决了缺猪栏的问题。同时，发动群众广泛利用空闲隙地扩种饲料，并组织群众上山突击采集各种野生饲料七十余万斤，还拨了三万多亩耕地作饲料基地，组织饲料专业队经营，保证了猪饲料的供应；此外，对原有养猪能手进行了认真审查，并选拔了一批政治可靠、有培养前途的青年当饲养员，还开办了专门训练班，分批训练，建立了一支出色的专业饲养队伍。
    今年4月，县委根据人民公社统一领导、分级管理的原则，对全县二千八百一十七个大小集体养猪场实行分级管理：确定大型饲养场由公社管理，以示范摸索集体养猪各方面的先进经验；中型饲养场由大队管理，注重大量繁殖仔猪；食堂普遍养猪以发展肥猪为主，保证内调外销。同时并大力扶植有饲养条件的社员，适当发展私人养猪。这样，养猪事业获得了高速度的平衡发展。现在，公社、大队、食堂的集体养猪已达到全县养猪总数的92.2％；私人养猪也达到占全县总农户50％以上。
    在发展集体养猪的过程中，县委一方面运用群众运动的工作方法，克服了发展集体养猪的困难，另一方面采取专业领导、专业饲料地、专业饲养队的措施，逐步改善了经营管理。一年来，摸索了一套比较完善的养猪方法：在饲养管理方面，饲养场根据母猪、仔猪、肥猪、公猪不同特点实行分群管理，根据各猪群的大小、强弱、吃食快慢、性情好坏，实行分类定栏、定槽喂养，根据生猪生长发育期的不同需要合理调配饲料，定时、定量喂养，特别是母猪空怀期、满怀前后期、产仔期间所需要的食料，采取专人分期定量喂养的办法，做到使母猪奶多、肥猪肉满、仔猪壮实、公猪膘好。在自养自繁方面：采取“见母必留，先留后选”的办法，先后挑选了良种母猪五万零九百二十五头，实行人工催情、药物催情的方法进行双配、复配、专人登记管理，消灭空怀母猪，提高产仔率。在防疫卫生方面，在病疫上采取以防为主，在治疗上采取以土为主，组织全县二百八十名民间兽医巡回防疫，分片包干，定期打防疫针，传授经验技术，把饲养员培训为防疫员，场内实行“三勤”（勤扫、勤垫、勤出粪）、“两消毒”（猪栏消毒、猪饲料消毒），作好经常性的防疫卫生工作，实行病畜隔离，推广土方草药治疗的办法，全县基本上防止了猪肺疫、猪丹毒的疫病。在饲料来源方面，采取了种好饲料地、采集野生饲料、利用农副产品作饲料、留足饲料粮和大搞青贮、干贮、熟贮饲料等办法。
    为了进一步发挥饲养场集体养猪的积极性，在经营管理方面，新晃县还普遍实行了以饲养场为单独核算单位，参加公社和大队统一分配。大队对饲养场实行“三包”、“一奖”即包工、包产、包成本，超产奖励；饲养场对饲养员实行“六定”（定品种、数量、定产值、定时间、定肥料、定工分）超产奖励的办法，贯彻按产计工，按工付酬，有效地提高了饲养员的责任心和工作积极性。开展技术革命，部分饲养场已实行了车子运潲、连灶煮潲，用水自流，利用水力自动切菜，大大提高了工效。
    现在，全县为保证完成1960年每户平均发展二十五头生猪的任务，正在抓紧储备饲料，扩建猪场，挑选良种母猪，大兴工具改革等一系列的准备工作。
