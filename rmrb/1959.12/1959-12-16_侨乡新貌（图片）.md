    New Look of the Overseas Chinese Hometown
    This is the new look of Taishan County in Guangdong Province. In this famous hometown of overseas Chinese, leap forward flowers are blooming everywhere. There are small and medium-sized factories for machinery, ceramics, grain processing, and building materials. Parks and artificial lakes have been opened, and many new buildings have been added.
    Compatriots abroad, please take a look at the bountiful rice harvest in Guanghai People's Commune this year. This is the fruit of the labor of your fellow villagers, and overseas Chinese have also contributed their share of sweat.
    Do you remember the Taishan Manpotou Hydropower Plant, which the reactionary government before liberation shouted about for many years but never built? Now we have built it. It can generate 250 kilowatts of electricity, which can supply electricity for industrial and lighting purposes in Taicheng Town and nearby rural areas.
    After work, come to this picturesque artificial lake to rest for a while! Appreciate the new appearance of your hometown, and recall the past wanderings and hardships, and people will be filled with emotions. [All of the above is a Xinhua News Agency dispatch]

    侨乡新貌
    这是广东省台山县城的新貌。在这个著名的侨乡，遍开了跃进的花朵。这里有机械、陶瓷、粮食加工、建筑材料等中小型工厂，开辟了公园、人工湖，增建了不少新楼大厦。
    异乡人，请你们看一看广海人民公社今年的水稻丰收景象吧，这是你们家乡人民的劳动成果，其中也有一分归侨的汗水。
    你们还记得解放前的反动政府叫喊了多少年始终没有建成的台山蛮陂头水电厂吗？现在我们已经建成了。它可发电二百五十瓩，可供台城镇和附近农村工业和照明用电。
    劳动之余，到这风光绮丽的人工湖边来休息一会吧！欣赏家乡的新姿，回忆过去的颠沛流离，人们都会感慨万千的。〔以上全部为新华社稿〕
