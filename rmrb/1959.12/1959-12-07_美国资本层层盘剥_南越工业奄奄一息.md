Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: Saigon News: American capital is further infiltrating South Vietnam.

The U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Affairs, Kearns, recently conducted activities in South Vietnam. When he arrived in Saigon on November 26th, he said that American capitalists would invest heavily in South Vietnam, preparing to "help" South Vietnam "complete its independent economy." In his speech in Saigon, he demanded favorable investment conditions for American private capital. According to him, "the business must be economical," "there must be reasonable guarantees," and the profits "must be able to become usable money at some point and return to the investors." He said that American private investment in the Far East has tripled since 1950, and now amounts to nearly one billion U.S. dollars; worldwide, the rate of American private capital investment abroad is about two billion U.S. dollars per year.

According to a recent report in the Saigon "Vietnam Times," under the form of joint ventures with the South Vietnamese authorities, an American company is preparing to invest 180 million South Vietnamese currency and one million U.S. dollars in South Vietnam to build a paper mill. "My-Viet Textile Company" is also preparing to expand its investment in order to build textile factories in the suburbs of Saigon and Da Nang. The United States also intends to invest in South Vietnam's Hiep Hoa Sugar Factory and will build sugar factories in Ben Cat in Thu Dau Mot Province and Tuy Hoa in Phu Yen Province.

Hanoi public opinion pointed out that the result of the American "help" to South Vietnam is, contrary to the deceptive remarks of American officials, not the emergence of any "independent economy" in South Vietnam, but rather the fact that South Vietnam's industry and commerce have fallen into a dying state. It is reported that in the textile industry, two-thirds of South Vietnam's textile machines have stopped production because textiles produced in South Vietnam cannot compete with American dumped textiles. In the sugar industry, more than 10,000 sugar workshops have now closed down, and sugar production in 1958 was only 25,000 tons, while pre-war sugar production was 40,000 tons. In terms of timber production, almost all of the 400 sawmills and 500 timber factories have closed down because the timber industry is monopolized by the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and private individuals have no right to cut timber.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: Saigon News: South Vietnam's "Minister of Economy" Nguyen Ngoc Tho revealed on November 2nd that from March 1958 to the end of August 1959, approximately ten billion South Vietnamese currency worth of foreign capital infiltrated South Vietnam.

According to an earlier report in the Saigon "Vietnam Times," in October, New York Triangle Company was approved to establish a textile factory near Saigon with a capital of 20 million U.S. dollars. American First Dairy Company was approved to establish a branch in Thu Duc with a capital of 56 million South Vietnamese currency.

This newspaper revealed that in order to attract foreign investment, the South Vietnamese regime has guaranteed not to implement "nationalization" and not to requisition. The newspaper also said that this guarantee was first proposed to the United States last year.

    美国资本层层盘剥
    南越工业奄奄一息
    新华社河内讯　西贡消息：美国资本正在进一步渗入南越。
    美国商务部负责国际事务的助理部长塞恩斯最近曾到南越活动。他在11月26日到达西贡时说，美国资本家将向南越大量投资，准备“帮助”南越“完成独立的经济”。他在西贡发表的讲话中要求为美国私人资本提供有利的投资条件。照他的说法，“事业必须是经济的”，“必须要有合理的保证”，利润“能够有一个时候变成可使用的钱回到投资者的手里”。据他说，美国在远东的私人投资从1950年以来已经增加了两倍，现在有将近十亿美元；在世界范围内，美国私人资本在国外的投资率是每年约二十亿美元。
    据西贡“越南时报”最近报道，在同南越当局合营的形式下，美国一家公司正准备向南越投资一亿八千万元（南越币）和一百万美元，用来修建一家造纸厂。“美越纺织公司”也正准备扩大投资，以便在西贡市郊和土伦修建纺织厂。美国还打算向南越的协和制糖厂投资，并且将在土龙木省的边沥和富安省的绥和修建制糖厂。
    河内舆论指出，美国对南越“帮助”的结果，同美国官员们的欺骗言论恰恰相反，南越不但没有出现什么“独立的经济”，倒是南越的工商业已经陷于奄奄一息的境地。据报道，在纺织业方面，南越三分之二的纺织机已经停止生产，因为南越生产的纺织品不能和美国倾销的纺织品相竞争。在制糖业方面，现在倒闭的糖业作坊达一万多个，糖的产量在1958年只有二万五千吨，而战前糖的产量是四万吨。在木材生产方面，四百家锯木厂和五百家木材厂几乎全部倒闭，因为木材业被美国—吴庭艳集团所垄断，私人无权砍伐木材。
    据新华社河内讯　西贡消息：南越的“经济部长”阮玉书11月2日透露，从1958年3月到1959年8月底，大约有相当于南越币十亿元的外国资本渗入南越。
    据西贡“越南时报”早些时候报道，在10月，纽约三角公司获准在西贡附近设立一座纺织厂，资本为二千万美元。美国第一乳品公司获准在守德设立一家分公司，资本为南越币五千六百万元。
    这家报纸透露，为了吸引外国投资，南越政权已经保证不实行“国有化”和不征用。这家报纸又说，这个保证是在去年首先向美国提出的。
