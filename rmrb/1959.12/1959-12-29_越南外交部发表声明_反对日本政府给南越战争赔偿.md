Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 28th: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today opposing the Japanese Senate's passage on December 23rd of the so-called war reparations agreement signed by the Kishi Nobusuke government and the South Vietnamese authorities on May 13th of this year.

The statement said: "According to the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam, the South Vietnamese authorities are only responsible for the temporary administration of South Vietnam pending the reunification of Vietnam. The South Vietnamese authorities are not qualified to represent the entire Vietnam. The war reparations agreement signed by the Kishi Nobusuke government with the South Vietnamese authorities is worthless."

The statement said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's forcing the Japanese Diet to pass the war reparations agreement it signed with the South Vietnamese authorities is part of the US imperialists' conspiracy to legalize its use of Japan to invade South Vietnam, to turn South Vietnam into a US military base in preparation for war, to undermine the Geneva Accords, and to permanently divide Vietnam. This behavior harms the interests of the Japanese and Vietnamese people. The statement pointed out, "The Kishi Nobusuke government must bear full responsibility for the consequences caused by the war reparations agreement it signed with the South Vietnamese authorities."

　　越南外交部发表声明
    反对日本政府给南越战争赔偿
    新华社河内28日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部今天发表声明，反对日本参议院在12月23日通过岸信介政府同南越当局在今年5月13日签订的所谓战争赔偿协定。
    声明说：“根据1954年关于越南的日内瓦协议，在等待越南统一期间，南越当局只负有暂时管理南越行政事务的责任。南越当局没有资格代表整个越南。岸信介政府同南越当局签订的战争赔偿协定是毫无价值的。”
    声明说，岸信介政府强迫日本国会通过它同南越当局签订的战争赔偿协定，是美帝国主义妄图把它利用日本侵入南越的行为合法化、把南越变成美国的军事基地以准备战争、破坏日内瓦协议和永远分裂越南的阴谋的一部分。这种行为损害了日本人民和越南人民的利益。声明指出，“岸信介政府必须对它同南越当局签订的战争赔偿协定所造成的后果负全部责任。”
