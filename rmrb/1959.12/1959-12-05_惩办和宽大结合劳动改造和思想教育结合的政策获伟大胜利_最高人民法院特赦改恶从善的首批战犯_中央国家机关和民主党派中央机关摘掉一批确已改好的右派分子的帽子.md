Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: The Supreme People's Court, in accordance with the amnesty order of the President of the People's Republic of China, today granted amnesty to the first group of war criminals.

After the amnesty order was announced on September 17th, the People's Government war criminal management organs conducted a comprehensive and strict review of the war criminals in custody.

The two war criminals who were granted amnesty and originally belonged to the puppet Manchukuo are: Aisin-Gioro Puyi, Emperor of the puppet Manchukuo, and Guo Wenlin, Lieutenant General Commander of the 10th Military District of the puppet Manchukuo.

The one war criminal who was granted amnesty and originally belonged to the puppet Mengjiang Autonomous Government: Xiong Nudun Duobu, Deputy Commander of the Whole Army of the puppet Xilin Gol League and Chahar League.

On December 4th, the Supreme People's Court held amnesty release conferences attended by all war criminals in custody at the war criminal management offices in various places, announced the list of war criminals released on amnesty, and issued them amnesty notices.

At the release conference, the war criminals who were granted amnesty expressed their infinite gratitude for the country's amnesty release.
