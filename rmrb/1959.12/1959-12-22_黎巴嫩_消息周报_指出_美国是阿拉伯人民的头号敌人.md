Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 19th: The Lebanese "News Weekly" published an editorial today stating that U.S. imperialism was, and still is, "the number one enemy of the Arab people."

The editorial once again refuted the claims by U.S. imperialism and its agents that the United States has changed its policy towards the Arab people and that the danger it poses to the Arab world no longer exists.

The editorial emphasized that the United States has not abandoned its imperialist aims in the Arab East, but that due to the Arab people's resolute struggle for liberation and peace, the United States "has had to change its tactics and methods to achieve the same goal."

The editorial pointed out, "For this purpose, the United States began to express false friendship towards Arab countries, pretending to be ready to provide them with unconditional assistance, and making countless promises to them."

The editorial further stated, "The aim of the United States is to open the door of Arab countries to U.S. monopoly capital and other imperialist capital, so as to extend their clutches into the Arab economy, place Arab countries under their rule, obstruct the development of Arab countries towards independence, and attempt to drag these countries back to the hateful rule of imperialism, making them once again backward, poor, and ignorant."

The editorial pointed out the shameful position of the United States in the United Nations in opposing the just struggle of Algeria, and Eisenhower's expression of support for this aggressive bloc during his visit to member states of the Central Treaty Organization. The editorial said that every day there is new evidence proving that U.S. imperialism is deeply hostile to the cause of the Arab people.

　　黎巴嫩“消息周报”指出
    美国是阿拉伯人民的头号敌人
    新华社贝鲁特19日电　黎巴嫩“消息周报”今天发表社论说，美帝国主义过去是、现在仍然是“阿拉伯人民的头号敌人”。
    社论再次驳斥了美帝国主义和它的代理人所谓美国已经改变了对阿拉伯人民的政策，它对于阿拉伯世界的危险已经不存在了的说法。
    社论强调说，美国并没有放弃它在阿拉伯东方的帝国主义目的，不过由于阿拉伯人民坚决进行的争取解放和和平的斗争，美国“不得不改变它的策略和方法来达到同一目的”。
    社论指出，“为了这个目的，美国开始对阿拉伯国家表示虚假的友谊，假装准备向它们提供无条件的援助，并且向它们许下无数诺言。”
    社论又说，“美国的目的是要使阿拉伯国家为美国垄断资本和其他帝国主义资本打开大门，以便把它们的魔爪伸入阿拉伯的经济中去，使阿拉伯国家处于它们的统治下，阻挠阿拉伯国家向独立的道路发展，并且企图把这些国家拉回到可恨的帝国主义的统治之下，使它们重新处于落后、贫困和愚昧状态”。
    社论指出了美国在联合国中反对阿尔及利亚的正义斗争的可耻立场，以及艾森豪威尔在访问中央条约组织成员国期间表示支持这个侵略集团。社论说，每一天都有新的证据证明美帝国主义是根深蒂固地敌视阿拉伯人民的事业的。
