Beijing Adopts Various Methods to Solidly Promote Advanced Experience
Advanced Seeds Take Root Deeply and Blossom Quickly

    (Our report) Beijing’s industrial system, around the time of the National Congress of Heroes, adopted various methods to promote advanced experiences in a planned, organized, and leadership-driven manner, forming a vigorous mass movement that achieved immediate results.
    In the past month, the city has promoted more than 1,100 nationally significant advanced experiences, solving key problems in current production. After the Jingsi Mining Bureau promoted important advanced experiences in the coal industry, such as "four-shift cross-operation" and "deep-hole blasting," raw coal production increased by 10.44%, coal roadway excavation footage increased by 12.5%, and rock excavation increased by 24%. After the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company promoted the advanced experience of the Congress of Heroes delegate Cao Jinyuan in smelting ferrosilicon using silicon carbide, the daily output of ferrosilicon increased by 30%, and electricity consumption decreased by 16.3%.
    In order to make the promotion of advanced experiences solid and effective, each unit used a variety of promotion methods based on the different characteristics of the advanced experiences and the specific conditions of their industry and type of work. There are six main forms: First, organize advanced technology performance teams to tour factories and perform technical demonstrations. Before and after each performance, organize discussions to explain the principles, answer questions, and provide suggestions until they are fully taught. During the performance, based on the specific situation and actual needs of each unit, in addition to advanced tools, the demonstrations use each factory's equipment, tools, and daily production components. This form is vivid and specific, both imparting advanced experience and eliminating the conservative thinking of some people. Second, for some comprehensive advanced experiences that are not suitable for performance, organize "medical teams" to go to factories to provide on-site guidance and impart experience, focusing on existing production problems. This form can "prescribe the right medicine" to impart experience, which has an immediate effect on promoting production. One of the long-standing key production problems at the First General Machinery Factory was the low forging efficiency of air compressor connecting rods. The forging "medical team" suggested that the factory improve the die shape and use fast forging methods. In the past, it took two hours to forge one, now it takes one hour to forge two. Third, for advanced experiences that cannot be quickly learned in one session, hold short-term advanced experience training classes. Short-term training classes have been organized for Ni Zhifu drill bits, Hao Jianxiu work method, and May Day weaving method. Within a month, the textile system, through holding advanced experience training classes at all levels, more than 95% of the spinning, weaving, and loom workers have mastered the supplemented and developed parts of the Hao Jianxiu work method and the May Day weaving method. Fourth, some factories' complete sets of advanced experiences are spread through the signing of inter-factory advanced technology mutual teaching contracts. The contract specifies specific items, methods, and times as one of the competition conditions, and regular inspections are carried out to urge implementation. The experience of toolization and automation of the sewing process at the Beijing Clothing Factory has been spread by signing contracts with seven sewing factories and cooperatives in six districts of the city. The transmitting unit not only teaches how to use it, but also teaches how to make tools and machines, until the learning unit can independently apply it in production. Fifth, for nationally significant advanced experiences that have not yet been fully mastered, send people to "learn from experience" and designate units for key experiments, with a deadline for implementation. After gaining experience, comprehensively promote it. This method has been adopted for eight types of work, such as small blast furnaces and winemaking. Sixth, hold exhibitions and organize units to visit and take what they need.
    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China gave clear instructions on the work of promoting advanced experience. The competent authorities conducted specific research on the major advanced experiences that should be promoted. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the trade union organizations and the relevant administrative bureaus have all formulated specific plans for promoting advanced experience, including the items of advanced experience, the scope, methods, and time of promotion. Full preparations were made in advance for the promotion of major advanced experiences. The advanced tools of lathe workers and planers have been appraised in advance, and blueprints have been printed and distributed to each unit during promotion. Many factories are headed by the Party Committee and have formed leading groups for the promotion of advanced experience. Xicheng District and Xuanwu District have organized inspection groups of more than 100 people to inspect the promotion situation according to industry or type of work and organize evaluations to deepen the movement step by step.

    北京采取多种方法扎扎实实推广先进经验
    先进种子扎根深开花快
    本报讯　北京工业系统在全国群英会闭幕前后，采用多种方法，有领导有组织有计划地推广先进经验，形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    一个月来，全市已推广了一千一百多项全国性重大先进经验，解决了当前生产上的关键问题。京西矿务局推广了“四班交叉作业”、“深孔爆破”等项煤炭工业中的重要先进经验以后，原煤产量提高了10.44％，煤巷掘进进尺提高12.5％，岩石掘进提高24％。石景山钢铁公司推广了群英会代表曹近元使用炭化矽冶炼矽铁的先进经验后，矽铁日产量提高了30％，电耗降低了16.3％。
    为了使推广先进经验的工作扎扎实实讲求实效，各单位根据先进经验的不同特点和本行业、本工种的具体情况，运用了多种多样的推广形式。主要的形式有六种：第一，组织先进技术表演队，巡回到各厂作技术表演。每次表演前后，都组织座谈，讲清道理，解答问题，提出建议，直到完全教会为止。表演时，从各单位的具体情况和实际需要出发，除了先进工具外，都用各厂的设备、工具和日常生产的部件来表演。这种形式生动、具体，既传授了先进经验，又消除了一些人的保守思想。第二，对于一些不适于表演的综合性的先进经验，组织“医疗队”到各厂针对生产存在的问题，进行现场指导，传授经验。这种形式能“对症下药”传授经验，对促进生产起到了立竿见影的效果。第一通用机械厂长期存在的生产关键之一，是空气压缩机连杆锻造效率低，锻工“医疗队”建议这个厂改进胎型，并使用了快速锻造方法，过去二小时锻造一个，现在一小时锻造两个。第三，对于不能一次很快学会的先进经验，举办短期的先进经验训练班。倪志福钻头、郝建秀工作法、五一织布法都组织了短期训练班。纺织系统在一个月时间内，通过层层举办先进经验训练班，有95％以上的细纱、织布、挡车工人掌握了郝建秀工作法、五一织布法补充发展的部分。第四，一些工厂成套的先进经验，通过签订厂际先进技术互教合同传播出去。合同中订出具体项目、方法和时间，作为竞赛条件之一，定期检查，督促实现。北京被服厂缝纫工序工具化、自动化的经验，就同全市六个区的七个缝纫厂、社订立合同作了传播。传授单位不仅教会使用，而且教会制作工具、机器，直到学习单位能够在生产上独立应用为止。第五，对于尚未充分掌握住的全国性重大先进经验，派人“取经”，并指定单位进行重点试验，限期实现，取得经验后再全面推广。小高炉、造酒等八个工种都采取了这种办法。第六，举办展览会，组织各单位前往参观，各取所需。
    中共北京市委对这次推广先进经验工作作了明确的指示。主管部门对应该推广的重大先进经验进行了具体研究。各级工会组织和有关行政管理局在党委的领导下，都制订了推广先进经验的具体规划，包括先进经验的项目，推广的范围、方法和时间。重大先进经验的推广，事先都作了充分的准备。车工、刨工的先进刀具，事先都作了鉴定，并晒出图纸，在推广时发给各单位。许多工厂由党委挂帅，组成先进经验推广领导小组。西城区和宣武区都组织了百人以上的检查团，按照行业或工种，检查推广情况，组织评比，使运动逐步深入。（附图片）
