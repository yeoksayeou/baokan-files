    Eliminating the Root of Ethnic Disputes
    Ye Fudan, Captain of Yongfeng Brigade, Haibin People's Commune

    The ethnic disputes in Jin'yintan, where our commune is located, before liberation, were well known, as depicted in the movie "Jin'yintan." At that time, due to the feudal separatism of the herdbowners and chieftains, coupled with the instigation of the Ma Bufang bandit gang, our Mongolian tribes and the local Tibetan tribes often engaged in armed struggles to compete for grassland, resulting in countless deaths and slaughtered livestock. Ten years before liberation, our tribe originally had only thirty-odd households. By the time of liberation in 1949, due to escapes and deaths, only eight households remained, with a total of ninety-nine livestock. Jin'yintan at that time was simply a disaster area.

    After liberation, under the brilliant light of the Party's ethnic policies, all ethnic groups became as close as one family and embarked on the happy road of socialism. All ethnic disputes left over from history have since vanished. With the warm concern and mediation of the Party and the People's Government, our two tribes began to reconcile. After the establishment of the commune, due to the change in the ownership of the means of production, the boundaries of the grasslands were broken, and the unified planning and more rational use of the grasslands were realized on a larger scale, which further fundamentally eliminated the root of ethnic disputes.

    Now, regardless of our ethnicity, under the brilliant light of the General Line of Socialist Construction, we are united under the banner of the People's Commune, respecting each other and working together, which has led to greater development in production. When the commune was established last year, the whole team had a total of 3,395 livestock of all kinds, which has now grown to 4,309. With the careful feeding of herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the team, a group of high-yielding sheep has also been raised. This sheep flock has a total of 259 ewes, which produced 318 lambs in the two lambing seasons last winter and this summer, with 312 surviving, reaching a breeding survival rate of 120.46%.

    消除了民族纠纷的祸根
    海滨人民公社永丰大队队长　业富旦
    我们公社所在的金银滩，解放前的民族纠纷，正如电影“金银滩”中描述的一样，是众所周知的。那时候，由于牧主、头人的封建割据，加上马步芳匪帮的从中挑唆，我们蒙古族部落和当地的藏族部落，经常为了争夺草山互相械斗，不知死了多少人，宰杀了多少牲畜。解放前十年，我们部落本来就只有三十多户，到1949年解放时，由于逃的逃，死的死，一共只剩下八户人家，各类牲畜只有九十九头。当时的金银滩简直是个灾难滩。
    解放后，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，各族人民亲如一家，共同走上了幸福的康庄大道，历史上遗留下来的所有民族纠纷，从此化为乌有。在党和人民政府的热情关怀和调解下，我们两个部落开始和好了。公社化后，由于生产资料所有制的改变，打破了草原界限，在更大范围内实现了草原的统一规划和更加合理的使用，就更进一步地从根本上消除了民族纠纷的祸根。
    现在，我们不分什么民族，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，团结在人民公社的旗帜下，互相尊重，共同劳动，使生产有了更大发展。去年公社成立时，全队共有各类牲畜三千三百九十五头，如今发展到四千三百零九头。在全队各族牧民的精心饲放下，还养了一群高产羊群。这个羊群共有二百五十九只母羊，去年冬季和今年夏季两次共产羔三百一十八只，成活三百一十二只，繁殖成活率达到了120.46％。
