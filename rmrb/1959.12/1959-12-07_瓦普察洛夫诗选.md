    Selected Poems of Vaptsarov
    [Editor's Note] Today marks the 50th anniversary of the birth of the outstanding Bulgarian proletarian poet Nikola Vaptsarov (1909-1942). Vaptsarov dedicated his entire life to the revolutionary struggle and was unfortunately murdered by the Hitlerite gang on July 23, 1942. His only collection of poems, "Motor Songs," was published in 1940, and during the years of fascist rule, this collection became a favorite book of Bulgarian patriots.
      Motherland
    The azure sky of my homeland smiles upon the land where I grew up all day long. At night, the stars shine like dazzling lanterns all the way until the new dawn arrives. But when the hard day is over, and I stride home in the twilight, I see my enemy hiding in the shadows with a gun. You once taught me, dear mother, to love everyone as I love you. I am willing to love them, mother, but I must also have bread and freedom.
        (Translated by Tang Yongkuan)
    Farewell (To my wife)
    Sometimes I will come back when you are asleep, as an unexpected guest. Don't close the door, don't leave me outside in the street! I will come in quietly, sit down gently, and gaze at you in the darkness. When my eyes have had their fill, I will kiss you, kiss you and leave.
    Song of Sacrifice ①
    The battle is arduous and cruel, the battle, as people say, is epic. I fall. Another person takes my place—why particularly praise one person? To be killed by the executioner—and then by worms, that is the simple logic. But, my people, because of our love for you. We will be with you in the storm!
  (2:00 PM, July 23, 1942) ①
    This is the last poem Vaptsarov wrote before his execution.
                    (Translated by Wu Yan)

    瓦普察洛夫诗选
    〔编者按〕今天是保加利亚优秀的无产阶级诗人尼古拉·瓦普察洛夫（1909—1942）诞生五十周年纪念日。瓦普察洛夫把自己的全部生命献给革命斗争，不幸在1942年7月23日被希特勒匪帮杀害。他的唯一的一本诗集“马达之歌”出版于1940年，在法西斯统治的岁月里，这本诗集成为保加利亚爱国者最喜爱的一本书。
      祖　国湛蓝的天空，整天对我生长的土地微笑。夜里繁星像一盏盏光芒闪耀的华灯一直照耀到新来的黎明。但当辛劳的一天已经过去，在暮色中跨着大步回家，我看见我的敌人正带着一支枪在黑影里躲藏。你曾经教过我，亲爱的母亲，要爱所有的人，像我爱你一样。我愿意爱他们，母亲，但是我必须也要有面包和自由。
        （汤永宽译）
    告别（给我的妻子）有时我会在你睡熟时回来，作一个意料不到的客人。不要把门关上，不要让我留在外边儿街上！我会悄悄地进来，轻轻地坐下，在黑暗中对你凝目而视，当我的眼睛看够了的时候，我就亲你，亲你而离去。就义之歌①战斗是坚苦而残酷的，战斗，正像人们所说的，是史诗。我倒下了。另一个人就接替我——何必特别标榜一个人呢？遭到刽子手——再遭到蛆虫，就是这样简单的逻辑。可是，我的人民啊，因为我们这样的热爱你们。在暴风雨中我们必将和你们在一起！
  （1942年7月23日下午二时）①
    这是瓦普察洛夫在临刑前写的最后一首诗。
                    （吴岩译）
