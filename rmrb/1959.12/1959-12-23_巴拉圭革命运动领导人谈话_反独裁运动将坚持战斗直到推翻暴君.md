According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Rio de Janeiro on the 21st: One of the main leaders of the Paraguayan Revolutionary Movement, Dr. Eduardo Cabrera, told a reporter from the Brazilian newspaper "Ultima Hora" that the anti-Stroessner movement was initiated by exiled youth, members of the February Revolutionary Party, and members of the Liberal Party. The anti-dictatorial forces possess a radio station and have begun broadcasting news about the "May 14th Movement" within Paraguay. He said that the anti-dictatorial movement will persist in its struggle until the dictator and his main cronies are finally eliminated.

Cabrera pointed out that the Paraguayan people, suffering from hunger and oppression, have taken up arms to fight and sacrifice their lives for freedom because they have long suffered various hardships and even have nothing to eat, while a large number of military officers live a life of luxury. He said, "Among the army, there are many colonels who are Americans and who are today colluding with Nazis to oppress the hungry people."

Cabrera pointed out that the Paraguayan people suffer from various diseases caused by hunger, while Stroessner leads a dissolute life, hosting lavish banquets for his mistresses. He said that workers can only eat one meal a day, and farmers live in extreme poverty.

Cabrera said: "The Paraguayan people will never stop fighting until they defeat the oppressors. We are full of confidence in victory. Although there are secret police and two thousand former German officers participating in the defense of the dictatorial regime, they will not be able to maintain this regime for long. The seeds of revolution have been sown, and we will continue to fight throughout the country."

Speaking about the goals of the anti-dictatorial struggle, Cabrera said that the primary task after overthrowing the dictatorship is to carry out land reform.

Cabrera concluded: "I call on the Paraguayan people to unite at this historic moment to finally end the shame of Latin America. I call on the soldiers, hoping that they will unite with the people, thereby changing Paraguay and making it a country without the wealthy." He warned the tyrant and his cronies, "Every patriot shot is sowing a seed for the freedom and democracy of Paraguay and the Americas."

　　巴拉圭革命运动领导人谈话
    反独裁运动将坚持战斗直到推翻暴君
    据新华社21日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴拉圭革命运动的主要领导人之一爱德华多·卡布雷拉医生接见巴西“最后一点钟报”记者时说，反斯特罗斯纳运动是由被放逐的青年人、二月党人和自由党人发起的。反独裁军拥有电台，并已开始在巴拉圭境内向人民播送关于“5月14日运动”的消息。他说，反独裁运动将坚持斗争，直到独裁者及其主要党羽最后被消灭为止。
    卡布雷拉指出，处于饥饿和压迫下的巴拉圭人民所以拿起武器进行斗争和为自由而献出生命，是因为他们长期以来遭受着各种痛苦，甚至没有东西吃，而大批军官却过着奢侈的生活。他说，“在军队当中有很多上校是美国人，并且今天还同纳粹分子勾结起来压迫饥饿的人民”。
    卡布雷拉指出，巴拉圭人民患有各种饥饿所造成的疾病，而斯特罗斯纳则花天酒地，为他的情妇们大宴宾客。他说，工人们每天只能吃一餐，农民生活在极其贫困的条件下。
    卡布雷拉说：“巴拉圭人民不战胜压迫者，决不停止斗争。我们对胜利满怀信心。尽管有秘密警察和前德国军官领导的二千人参加保卫独裁政权，但是他们将不能长期保住这个政权。革命的种子已经种下了，我们将在全国继续战斗。”
    卡布雷拉在谈到反独裁斗争的目的时说，在推翻独裁统治后，首要的任务是进行土地改革。
    卡布雷拉最后说：“我呼吁巴拉圭人民在这个具有历史意义的时刻团结一致，来从此结束拉丁美洲的耻辱。我号召军人们，希望他们同人民团结一致，从而改变巴拉圭，使巴拉圭成为一个没有财主的国家。”他警告暴君及其党羽说，“每枪毙一个爱国者，就是为巴拉圭和美洲的自由和民主播下一粒种子。”
