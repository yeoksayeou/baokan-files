Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 24th: After completing this year's national plan ahead of schedule, the five factories and one mine affiliated with the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company are vigorously grasping production preparations for next year to ensure a steady rise in production levels in the first quarter of next year.

In November, the Fertilizer Plant, Dye Plant, Calcium Carbide Plant, Chemical Machinery Plant, Steel Materials Plant, and Mingcheng Lime Mine, all affiliated with the company, made comprehensive arrangements for next year's production preparations. "1960 Production Preparation Work Groups" were established at each level, and departments such as production planning, power machinery, and materials supply took the lead in preparing for next year's production. Currently, thousands of maintenance workers in the factories and mines are inspecting sixty-three major pieces of equipment. The machine repair workshops of the Chemical Machinery Plant and the three chemical plants (Fertilizer, Calcium Carbide, and Dye Plants) have already rushed to produce the first batch of over one hundred and sixty tons of spare parts needed for next year in early December and are now rushing to produce the second batch of spare parts, totaling one hundred and twenty tons.

The company needs a wide variety of raw materials and in huge quantities for next year. In addition to relying on state allocation, employees are actively producing some raw materials and finding substitute raw materials using indigenous methods, adhering to the principle of self-reliance. Currently, 96% of the raw materials needed by the entire company for the first quarter of next year have been prepared.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 24th: Workers at the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant are preparing for a good start and a continued leap forward in production next year, striving to produce more high-quality phosphate fertilizer and highly effective pesticides to support agricultural production.

The Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant has initially drafted its plan for next year. According to this plan, both the variety and output of products will increase significantly compared to this year, and the four newly built workshops will be put into production in early next year. Facing the production plan for continued leap forward next year, all employees of the plant are infinitely excited and have decided to strengthen equipment maintenance, prepare sufficient spare parts, minimize downtime for repairs, strengthen packaging and transportation, and carry out technological innovations to ensure a good start to production next year.

Currently, workers have inspected and renovated the equipment of the powdered fertilizer production system. The mechanical and power system and the repair departments of each production workshop have rushed to produce more than eighteen thousand spare parts, which is sufficient for use in the first quarter of next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: After comprehensively overfulfilling this year's national plan, the Hunan Pesticide Plant is both focusing on current production and actively preparing for next year's production.

The factory has initially formulated a plan for continued leap forward in production next year and has distributed the production plan for the first quarter to workshops and teams. The entire factory has conducted a major inventory of raw materials based on the production needs of this year and next year, and has dispatched more sales personnel to collect and transport raw materials to various regions according to the quotas and designated areas allocated by the state.

    吉林化学工业公司准备好明年第一季度的原材料
    南京磷肥厂和湖南农药厂订出明年继续跃进计划
    据新华社长春24日电　吉林化学工业公司所属五厂一矿，提前完成今年国家计划以后，正在狠抓明年的生产准备工作，保证明年第一季度的生产水平稳步上升。
    11月份，这个公司所属肥料厂、染料厂、电石厂、化工机械厂、钢铁材料厂和明城石灰矿，就对明年的生产准备工作作了全面安排。逐级成立了“1960年生产准备工作组”生产计划、动力机械、材料供应等部门都先行一步，首先做好明年生产准备工作。目前，各厂矿几千名检修工人正在检修六十三项重大设备。化工机械厂和肥料、电石、染料三个化工厂的机修车间，已在本月上旬赶制出第一批一百六十余吨明年需要的备品备件，现在正赶制总量达一百二十吨的第二批备品备件。
    这个公司明年需要的原料材料品种繁多，数量巨大，除了依靠国家调拨以外，职工们本着自力更生的原则，积极用土法生产部分原料和寻找代用原料。全公司明年第一季度所需要的原料，目前已准备好96％。
    据新华社南京24日电　南京磷肥厂职工正为明年生产开门红和持续跃进作准备，争取明年生产更多的优质磷肥和高效农药支援农业生产。
    南京磷肥厂初步编制了明年的计划。按照这个计划，产品品种和产量都将比今年增加很多，新建的四个车间都在明年初投入生产。面对着明年继续跃进的生产计划，全厂职工无限兴奋，决定加强设备维护，准备好充足的备件，最大限度地缩短停车检修时间，加强包装和运输工作，开展技术革新等，保证明年生产开门红。
    目前，职工们已经检查和改造了粉肥生产系统的设备。机械动力系统和各生产车间检修部门已突击赶制出一万八千多件备品备件，足够明年第一季度使用。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南农药厂在全面超额完成今年的国家计划后，一面狠抓当前生产，一面积极为明年生产作准备。
    工厂已经初步制订了明年生产继续跃进的计划。并将第一季度的生产计划下达到车间小组。全厂根据今年和明年生产的需要进行了一次原料材料大清理，并且加派供销人员按照国家所分配的指标和指定的地区，到各地采运原料材料。
