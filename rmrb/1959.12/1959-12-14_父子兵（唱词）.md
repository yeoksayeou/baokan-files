The moon sets in the west, the rooster hasn't crowed, the sky is hazy and the stars are sparse. Uncle Zhang wakes up with a start, gets up to check on the little rascal. Sure enough, the side room door is tightly closed, quiet and still. The bedding is all in the room, but the little rascal is nowhere to be seen. The little guy returned home for summer vacation and has been helping the team dig ditches from morning till night. Several times we told him to rest, but he wouldn't listen. Getting up in the middle of the night, I don’t know what he is up to? Uncle Zhang is worried and goes outside to look for him. Under the melon shed, the little guy is sleeping soundly, with pieces of wire and lead all around him. He's even clutching a small piece of iron in his hand. In his dream, he's installing a machine, determined to make a mineral radio for the team. The radio is playing Sichuan opera, singing about Qi Jiguang fighting the enemy, singing about the Japanese pirates' heads falling one after another, when suddenly his arm is grabbed and pulled up! "Ouch, a sneak attack is too unreasonable, who dares to bully this commander!" He roars and throws a punch, but when he opens his eyes, it's his dad. Carrying baskets, wielding hoes, like a roaring fire, everyone on the construction site is as fierce as a tiger, digging and carrying dirt busily. The quitting time bell can't stop ringing, the commune members return home under the moonlight. Young people want to go to the club, some are pulling the little rascal to listen to storytelling. The little rascal says he has serious business to do. He wants to fix the hoe while it's cool, and he starts walking. No matter how much we persuade him, he answers: "No, no, no." The little rascal goes home, puts down the hoe and picks up a bamboo basket, goes around the corner and comes to the bottom of the mountain, jumping and leaping up the mountain. Standing on the cliff, he looks down, a large pile of "golden-haired lions" (Note) growing in the middle of the cliff. The little rascal's radio still needs parts, and he can only buy them by selling these "golden-haired lions." He wipes the sweat from his forehead with his long sleeves, rolls up his trouser legs and pulls up his shirt. He chooses an old pine tree as big as a rice bowl, and ties it securely with a palm rope. He grabs the rope and flips down the cliff, reaching the middle of the cliff in a few quick moves. Hey, those "golden-haired lions" look really good, with fluffy yellow fur all over. In the blink of an eye, the bamboo basket is full, piled high. On his day off, he sells the medicinal materials to buy parts. He's happy to be able to make a machine for everyone. Stars twinkle, the moon is dim, Uncle Zhang puts on a stern face and strides into the door. The little rascal is sitting up straight, wearing headphones and listening to the radio. When he sees him, he shouts: "Dad, come and listen!" Little does he know, his dad is cold as ice. He scolds the child: "You're fooling around. Why didn't you go to the meeting in the commune tonight? Many people are giving up their vacation to dig wells, and you disappeared without a word! As soon as you get off work, you run off without a trace, distracted like you've lost your soul!" This scolding is like a thunderbolt, the little rascal's eyes turn green. After a long silence, he asks in a small voice: "Do you want to listen to the Party Central Committee's communique?" "What! What communique?" Uncle Zhang asks repeatedly, putting on the headphones and listening intently. The communique comes from the top of Mount Lu, calling for increased production and thrift, and opposing rightist tendencies. The more Uncle Zhang listens, the more excited he becomes, he sees thousands of troops and horses surging before his eyes; he hears the mountain pines roaring, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River opening their throats to laugh, the Three Mountains and Five Peaks standing tall and charging forward, the drums shaking and the bugles resounding through the nine heavens... Uncle Zhang dances with excitement, unable to restrain himself, repeatedly calling: "You come and listen too!" But the little rascal has long disappeared without a trace, Uncle Zhang is left unable to get angry or laugh. Spring thunder rumbles, mountains and rivers shake, the rosy clouds shine and everything is new, the commune members boost their morale and make promises: to rush-plant autumn potatoes to increase the harvest, and to rush-plant late autumn crops in a timely manner, deciding to fight a big battle on Bajiao Flat that day. The more Uncle Zhang thinks about it, the more excited he gets, he goes non-stop to look for his son. The work gong sounds and the mountains echo, Uncle Zhang hurriedly goes to Bajiao Flat. "Huh... it seems like someone is on Bajiao Flat, hey, there really is someone! Oh, which hero is taking the lead? Right! We're all competing for the upstream! Hey! That hero, quickly announce your name! This old man wants to compete with you to see who wins!" But the person refuses to answer, only hearing a sneaky giggle. Uncle Zhang rushes forward a few steps, only to find that it's the little rascal deliberately keeping silent. Only then does he announce his name: "Dad, I'm a primary school student, I admit that I'm challenging you, today I'll see Huang Zhong fight Little Luo Cheng!" "You little thing, you're really mischievous, making this old man look for you everywhere, come, come, let's charge together, let's be father and son with one heart!" At this time, all the commune members arrive, praising the father and son soldiers in unison.

    父子兵（唱词）
  　萧歌月西坠，鸡未啼，天色朦胧星星稀，张大爷一惊翻身起，起来去看小调皮。果然厢房门紧闭，静静悄悄无声息，铺笼帐被都在房间里，不见儿子小调皮。小家伙放暑假回到家里，从早到晚帮倒队里挖水渠，几次三番喊他休息他不愿意，半夜起床不晓得搞些啥东西？张大爷不放心找到门外去，瓜棚下小家伙睡得甜蜜蜜，在身边皮线铅丝乱丢一起。手里头还捏着一块小铁皮。睡梦中他正在安装机器，一心要给队里做架矿石收音机。收音机正在唱川戏，唱的是戚继光上阵杀仇敌，正唱到倭寇人头纷纷落下地，手膀子被人揪着往上提！“哎哟哟，暗箭伤人太无理，何人敢把本帅欺！”他大吼一声挥拳就要打过去，睁眼一看才是他的爹。鸳篼飞，锄头舞，恰似火旺水正沸，工地上人人猛如虎，挖土挑土好忙碌。下班铃声响不住，社员们踏月转回屋。青年们要上俱乐部，有的在拉小调皮去听评书。小调皮说他还有正事做。趁凉快他要修理挖锄，边说他就边动脚步。再三劝他都回答：“不，不，不。”小调皮，回家院，放下锄头提竹篮，转弯抹角来到山下面，连蹦带跳就上了山。站在崖边往下看，一大堆金毛狮子长在崖中间。小调皮的收音机还要差零件，卖了这金毛狮子（注）才能买回还。只见他扯长袖子擦了汗，卷起裤脚又捞衣衫。选了根老松树大如斗碗，用棕绳牢牢捆来紧紧拴。抓住绳子翻身下崖坎，三刨两爪就到了崖中间。嘿，那金毛狮子长得才好看，满身绒毛黄鲜鲜。转眼竹篮就装满，满满一篮垒了尖。公休日他卖了药材买零件，能给大家做架机器他好喜欢。繁星点点，月不明，张大爷马起面孔跨进门，小调皮坐得很端正，戴着耳机在收音，一见忙喊：“爹爹，快来听！”殊不知大爷冷冰冰。骂声娃娃：“你在鬼混，今晚上社里开会为啥不去听？好多人都放弃休假在打井，你不声不响一人溜进城！一下班就跑得无踪无影，心神不定硬像掉了魂！”这顿骂尤如五雷轰头顶，小调皮绿起一对大眼睛。哑了半天他又小声问：“党中央的公报，你听不听？”“啥！啥公报？”大爷连声问，戴上耳机他就入了神。公报来自庐山顶，号召增产节约反右倾。大爷越听越振奋，他眼前千军万马在奔腾；又听得满山松涛嚯嚯的震，长江大河敞开喉咙发笑声，三山五岳挺胸齐上阵，金鼓震动号角响彻九霄云……张大爷手舞脚蹈情不能自禁，连声呼唤：“你也快来听！”谁知那调皮鬼早已无踪影，大爷弄得发不起气笑不出声。春雷动，山河震，霞光普照万象新，社员们鼓起干劲提保证：要抢种秋洋芋增加收成，增种晚秋要抢时令，决定当天大战八角坪。张大爷越想越兴奋，他马不停蹄去把儿子寻。上班锣响群山应，张大爷急急忙忙转到八角坪。“咦……八角坪上好像有人影，嘿，坪上硬是有个人！吔，是哪位好汉抢先上了阵？对！我们大家都把上游争！喂！那位好汉快快报名姓！老汉我要同你比输赢！”殊不知那个人闭口不答应，只听得嘻嘻嘻的暗笑声。张大爷忙抢几步走到临近，原来是小调皮故意不出声。这时他才报名姓：“爹爹，我是一个小学生，要挑战孩儿我承认，看今朝黄忠奋战小罗成！”“小东西你实在调皮得很，害得老子八方把你寻，来来来我们齐上阵，做一个父子二人一条心！”这时候社员全部到齐整，同声赞扬父子兵。
