    "Ranking" and "Comparing"
    Yu Yang
    By ranking advanced, intermediate, and backward units and studying the differences between them, the Changzhou Municipal Party Committee discovered a common pattern: advanced factories are first and foremost advanced in their thinking, full of drive, and courageous in moving forward; while backward units like to emphasize difficulties, are content to be in the middle, do not seek to improve, or are complacent and stick to old ways. This kind of ranking and comparing allows us to find the most fundamental problem from a variety of factors. Objective conditions such as equipment, technical strength, and raw material supply certainly have a certain relationship to whether a factory's production is advanced or not. However, talent occupies the most important position in production. Whether the role of people can be brought into play depends first and foremost on whether they have the idea of striving for advancement and continuous progress. With the idea of striving for advancement, people will be proactive in everything they do. For example, if there is no large equipment, people will come up with the method of "ants gnawing at bones"; if there are no foreign machines, people will use indigenous methods to manufacture them; if there are no raw materials, people will look around and find ways to use substitutes; if the technical level is low and the technical strength is weak, people will take the initiative to study, improve, and train themselves. In this way, the preconditions for transforming backwardness into advancement are met. It is precisely because of grasping this point that the Changzhou Municipal Party Committee has found the "prescription" for narrowing and eliminating the differences between the advanced and the backward – that is, to reverse the conservative thinking of the backward units and encourage them to strive for advancement.
    "Comparing" is the method used by the Changzhou Municipal Party Committee to specifically solve problems after they have been discovered.
    Xun Qing of the Warring States period once said: "Without climbing high mountains, one does not know the height of the sky; without approaching deep valleys, one does not know the thickness of the earth." The result of "comparing" is to make people compare production, quality, organization, management, equipment, technology, leadership methods, and political ideology. Just like eating bamboo shoots, peeling them layer by layer, thereby finding the essence of things. This kind of "comparing" is most persuasive in promoting backward units to overcome conservative thinking, invigorate themselves, and forge ahead courageously.
    We advocate this kind of "ranking" and "comparing" because it promotes our leadership work to become more and more meticulous; it promotes the leading cadres of enterprises to always adhere to putting politics in command. As a result, the subjective initiative of the masses will be brought into fuller play, and production will continue to leap forward!

    “排”和“比”
    于羊
    通过对先进、中间、落后单位的排队，研究他们之间的差异，常州市委发现了一个共同的规律：凡是先进的工厂，首先是思想先进，干劲十足，勇往直前；而落后的单位则是喜欢强调困难，甘居中游，不求上进，或是骄傲自满，故步自封。这样一排一比，就从纷纭多端的各种因素中找到最根本的问题了，诸如设备条件，技术力量，原材料供应等等客观条件，对一个工厂生产的先进与否，固然有一定关系，但是，只有人才在生产中占居最主要的地位。而人的作用能否发挥，又首先在于有无力争上游，不断跃进的思想。有了力争上游的思想，人就会处处主动。比如，没有大设备，人们就会想出“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法；没有洋机器，人们就会用土办法来制造；没有原料，人们就会四处去找，想办法用代用品；技术水平低，技术力量薄弱，人们就会主动地去学习、提高，自己动手培养。这一来，变落后为先进的前提条件就具备了。正是由于抓住了这一点，常州市委找到了缩小和消灭先进与落后之间的差异的“药方”。——这就是反掉落后单位的保守思想，鼓起他们力争上游的干劲。
    “比”，是常州市委在发现问题以后，具体地解决问题的办法。
    战国时代的荀卿曾经说过：“不登高山不知天之高也，不临深谷不知地之厚也。”，“比”的结果，就使人从比产量、质量高低，比到组织管理，设备技术，再比到领导方法与政治思想。就像吃竹笋一样，一层一层的剥了下去，从而找到了事物的本质。这种“比”，对促使落后单位克服保守思想，振作起来，奋勇前进，最具有说服力。
    我们提倡这种“排”和“比”，因为它促使我们的领导工作越做越细；促使企业的领导干部经常坚持政治挂帅。从而，群众的主观能动性，就将发挥得更加充分，生产就将持续地跃进！
