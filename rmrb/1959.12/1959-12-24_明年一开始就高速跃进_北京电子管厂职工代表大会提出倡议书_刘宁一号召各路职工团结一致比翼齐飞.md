Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, having already comprehensively overfulfilled this year's state plan ahead of schedule, has sounded the clarion call for continued leaps forward next year. The factory's entire workforce has put forward a proposal to workers in factories and mines across the country: Hold the red flag of the General Line even higher, set lofty ambitions, make firm resolutions, attack the most advanced and scale the highest peaks, implement the policy of high quality, high output, many varieties, low consumption, and safe production, guarantee a red ending to this year and a red opening to next year, and strive to realize a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

The proposal was adopted at the factory's Workers' Representative Assembly, which concluded on the 22nd.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. Liu Ningyi praised the revolutionary spirit of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory workers in promptly discussing next year's production plan and proposing greatly increased targets after comprehensively overfulfilling this year's state plan ahead of schedule. He said that this fully demonstrated the heroic spirit that the working class should possess, of being unsatisfied with existing achievements and advancing courageously.

Liu Ningyi said that 1959 was another year of great leap forward and victory following 1958. This victorious year has provided extremely favorable conditions politically, ideologically, materially, and technically for striving to achieve continued leaps forward next year. He called on workers across the country to better implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction and a complete set of two-legged walking policies on the basis of the successive great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, and strive for the continued leap forward of the national economy. It is now necessary to pay special attention to preparing for next year's production, ensure the steady rise of production in the first quarter of next year, and open up a high-speed leap forward situation right from the start, laying a solid foundation for a sustained leap forward throughout the year.

Liu Ningyi, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, warmly supported the proposal put forward by the workers of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory to fraternal factories and enterprises across the country. He said that he earnestly hoped that all enterprises and all worker comrades across the country would actively respond to this proposal, so that the country's industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, capital construction, finance and trade, as well as science and culture, all fronts, and all personnel would unite and soar together.

The proposal issued by the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory to fraternal factories across the country put forward various specific targets for the first quarter and the whole of next year. The targets for the first quarter of next year are: total industrial output value to increase by 18% compared to the estimated completion figure for the fourth quarter of this year, commodity output value to increase by 16%, the output of major products to increase by 10%, labor productivity to increase by 18%, costs to decrease by 5%, 100% completion of the variety task, and guaranteed delivery according to contract. The targets for the whole of next year are: total industrial output value to increase by 42% compared to the estimated completion figure for 1959, commodity output value to increase by 47%, the output of major products to increase by 36%, variety to increase by 41%, total labor productivity to increase by 40%, comparable product costs to decrease by 10%, and the quality of ex-factory products to be guaranteed reliable and stable. The proposal also put forward specific measures to achieve the above targets. The proposal was put forward after full discussion by worker representatives and all workers.

The entire workforce of the factory, from leading cadres and office staff to the vast number of production workers, has now been mobilized under the slogan "A Red Ending to This Year, A Red Opening to Next Year". The production plan for the first quarter of next year has been fully disseminated to workshops and groups and has been discussed many times. More than 99% of the 1,762 key materials required for the production of electronic tubes in the first quarter have been prepared, most of the equipment has been overhauled, and more than 18,000 equipment spare parts and more than 400 sets of molds and dies urgently needed for production have been manufactured.

　　明年一开始就高速跃进
    北京电子管厂职工代表大会提出倡议书
    刘宁一号召各路职工团结一致比翼齐飞
    据新华社23日讯　已经提前全面超额完成今年国家计划的北京电子管厂，吹响了明年继续跃进的号角。这个工厂的全体职工向全国各厂矿企业职工提出倡议：更高地举起总路线的红旗，立大志、下决心，攻尖端、攀高峰，贯彻优质、高产、多品种、低消耗、安全生产的方针，保证今年红到底，明年开门红，力争实现1960年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    倡议书是在这个工厂22日闭幕的职工代表大会上通过的。
    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一出席了大会，并且讲了话。刘宁一对北京电子管厂职工在提前全面超额完成今年国家计划之后，及时讨论明年生产计划，并且提出大幅度跃进指标的不断革命精神，表示赞扬。他说，这充分表现了工人阶级应该有的、不满足已有成绩、奋勇前进的英雄气概。
    刘宁一说，1959年是继1958年之后又一个伟大跃进的胜利年。这个胜利年从政治上、思想上、物质上、技术上为争取实现明年的继续跃进提供了极为有利的条件。他号召全国职工，在1958年和1959年连续大跃进的基础上，更好地贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，争取国民经济的继续跃进。现在要特别抓紧做好明年的生产准备工作，保证明年第一季度的生产稳步上升，一开始就打开高速度跃进的局面，为全年持续跃进打好基础。
    刘宁一代表中华全国总工会热烈支持北京电子管厂的职工向全国兄弟工厂企业提出的倡议。他说，他殷切希望全国所有的企业、所有的职工同志们，积极响应这个倡议，使祖国的工矿企业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面以及科学文化方面，各条战线、各路人马团结一致，比翼齐飞。
    北京电子管厂向全国兄弟工厂发出的倡议书，提出了明年第一季度和全年的各项具体指标。明年第一季度的指标是：工业总产值比今年第四季度预计完成数增长18％，商品产值增长16％，主要产品产量增长10％，劳动生产率提高18％，成本降低5％，品种百分之百地完成任务，并且保证按合同交货。明年全年的指标是：工业总产值比1959年预计完成数增长42％，商品产值增长47％，主要产品产量增长36％，品种增长41％，全员劳动生产率提高40％，可比产品成本降低10％，出厂产品质量保证可靠稳定。倡议书还提出了实现上述指标的具体措施。倡议书是经过职工代表和全体职工充分讨论后提出的。
    现在这个厂的全体职工，从领导干部、科室人员到广大的生产工人在“今年红到底，明年开门红”的口号下，已经动员起来。明年第一季度的生产计划已经全部下达到车间、小组，并进行过多次讨论。全厂第一季度电子管生产所需要的一千七百六十二项关键材料，已有99％以上作好了准备，绝大部分设备也已检修完毕，并制造了生产急需的一万八千多个设备备件和四百多副工模具。
