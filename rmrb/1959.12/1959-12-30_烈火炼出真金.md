True Gold Comes from the Crucible
　　Yu Ji

　　An ambulance sped along amidst the sound of artillery fire. Inside the vehicle, two military officers urgently reported to the frontline hospital via radio: "A combat hero… 80% of his body is burned, 55% of it is third-degree burns… body temperature is 41.5 degrees Celsius, pulse is 160… massive blood loss… still in shock…” The recently produced feature film "True Gold in the Crucible" by the August First Film Studio immediately plunges the audience into such a tense atmosphere, making you eager to know what exactly happened. But it's not a thriller; instead, through a story from the Fujian front, it composes an ode to revolutionary heroism and communist spirit.

    In the autumn of 1958, during an intense artillery battle, an enemy shell landed on our artillery position, collapsing the ammunition depot. Flames approached the artillery piece, and hero Wang Zhiqiang rescued the cannon in the fire and hit an enemy ship. Wang Zhiqiang suffered severe burns and was in critical condition; the Party and the people took various measures to save his life. After recovering, he returned to the front line and plunged into a new battle.

    The noble qualities of a people's soldier, and the lofty character of a Communist Party member, are concentrated in: taking the interests of the Party and the people as one's highest interests, and for the sake of those highest interests, not hesitating to sacrifice one's own life. In this film, as Wang Zhiqiang braved the smoke and flames to crawl toward the artillery piece, the fire had burned his hands and his entire body, but he finally bit the end of the firing cord with his teeth and fired the last shell. The ancients often used "remaining calm even when Mount Tai collapses before you" to describe a person's courage and composure. For heroic figures like Wang Zhiqiang, this phrase is clearly not enough to describe his fearless spirit. His revolutionary heroic spirit of going through fire and water, advancing bravely, and facing the danger of life without fear, demonstrates the fine qualities of a people's soldier and the Party spirit of a Party member. It is precisely because he has this quality that he unhesitatingly used his body to shield Xiaomei (a farmer's young daughter) during an enemy air raid; therefore, after being hospitalized with burns, he was able to overcome pain, overcome death, and finally victoriously return to the front line. In terms of creation, we emphasize the portrayal of character. In my opinion, a character like Wang Zhiqiang, who shines with the brilliance of Party spirit, is the greatest and most sublime character, the character that we should write about in bold and special detail.

    The work not only shapes the heroic image of Wang Zhiqiang as a class fighter; at the same time, around the rescue of Wang Zhiqiang's life, it fully demonstrates the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people and the army under the leadership of the Party. "We must save Wang Zhiqiang!" This is the call issued by the Party. It reflects the demands of the people, the demands of the comrades-in-arms, and the demands of the medical personnel. In order to save Wang Zhiqiang, we saw the great scene of the masses vying to donate blood and skin to the hero, saw the moving scene of the municipal party secretary vying to donate blood, saw the medical personnel working selflessly day and night, and saw the support from all regions and the concern of the leading organs for the wounded. We saw the formation of a communist ideological style under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, reflecting the spirit of our times.

    Such a film is high-spirited, emotionally full, and full of optimism. After seeing it, it gives people strength to move forward in thought. This is the most important thing. (Attached image)

　　烈火炼出真金
　　虞棘
    一辆救护车，在炮火声中奔驰着。车上，两位军官用报话机急切地向前线医院报告：“一个战斗英雄……全身烧伤面积80％，三度烧伤五十五……体温四十一度点五，脉搏一百六十……大量失血……还在休克……”，八一厂最近摄制的故事片“烈火真金”，一开始就把人带进这样紧张的气氛之中，使你急于知道究竟发生了什么事。但它不是惊险影片；而是通过福建前线的一段故事，谱写了一曲革命英雄主义的赞歌、共产主义风格的赞歌。
    1958年秋天，在一次激烈的炮战中，敌人的一枚炮弹，落到了我们的炮阵地上，炸塌了弹药库，烈火烧近炮床，英雄战士王志强在烈火中抢救了大炮，并且击中了敌舰。王志强受了严重的烧伤，生命垂危；党和人民采取种种措施救活了他。伤愈之后，他又回到前线，投入新的战斗。
    一个人民战士的优美品德，一个共产党员的崇高的党性，集中的表现是：以党的利益、人民的利益作为自己最高的利益，为了最高的利益，不惜牺牲自己的生命。在这部影片中，当王志强冒着浓烟烈火爬向炮床时，火已烧坏了他的双手，烧着了他的全身，可是他终于用牙齿咬住拉火绳头，放出了最后一发炮弹。古人常用“泰山崩于前而色不变”来形容一个人的勇敢和沉着，对于王志强这样的英雄人物来说，用这句话形容他的大无畏精神，显然是不够的。他那种赴汤蹈火、勇往直前，面临生命的危险而毫无畏惧的革命英雄主义气概，就是表现了一个人民战士的优美品德，一个党员的党性。也正是因为他有这种品德，所以，在一次敌机轰炸时，他毫不犹豫地用身体去掩护小梅（一个农民的小女儿）；所以，在他烧伤入院后，他能战胜了痛苦，战胜了死亡，最后胜利地重回前线。在创作上，我们强调要刻划人物性格，我看，像王志强这样闪耀着党性光辉的性格，就是最伟大最崇高的性格，就是我们应当大写而特写的性格。
    作品不仅塑造了王志强这样一个阶级战士的英雄形象；同时，围绕着挽救王志强的生命，充分表现了在党的领导下人民和军队的血肉关系。“一定要救活王志强！”这是党发出的号召。它反映了人民群众的要求，部队战友们的要求和医务人员的要求。为了救活王志强，我们看到了群众争先恐后为英雄输血和献皮的伟大场面，看到了市委书记争先输血的动人情景，看到了医务人员夜以继日地忘我劳动，看到了各地的支援和领导机关对伤员的关怀。我们看到了在党的总路线光辉照耀下共产主义思想风格的形成，反映了我们的时代精神。
    这样的影片，意志昂扬，情绪饱满，充满乐观主义精神，看过之后，给人思想上增加了前进的力量。这是最最主要的。（附图片）
