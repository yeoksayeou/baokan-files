    A basket of gold, a basket of songs
    Guizhou has many mountains and slopes connecting to each other,
    There are many treasures in the mountains,
    Men and women, old and young, all go up the mountains,
    To collect mountain goods for processing,
    Going there with empty baskets in pairs,
    Returning with a basket of gold and a basket of songs.
          (Southeastern Guizhou)
    The leaves of the trees in the mountains are green,
    The treasures in the mountains are countless,
    Chairman Mao is such a good leader,
    Picking leaves and turning them into gold.
            (Jianhe County)

    一箩金子一箩歌贵州山多坡接坡，山中宝藏多又多，男女老少齐上山，采下山货来加工，去时一对一对空箩箩，回时一箩金子一箩歌。
          （黔东南）山中木叶皮皮青，山中宝物数不尽，毛主席呵好领导，摘箩木叶变黄金。
