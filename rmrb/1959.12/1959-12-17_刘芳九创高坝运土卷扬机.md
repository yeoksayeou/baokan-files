    Liu Fangjiu Creates High Dam Soil Transporting Winch
    By our reporter Méi Guóbǎo
    The Ziyunshan Reservoir in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, is using the high dam soil transporting winch created by carpenter Liu Fangjiu everywhere. The efficiency of transporting soil to the dam is now sixty times higher than manual labor.
    Liu Fangjiu is a member of the Yuan Du Commune in Fengcheng County. Before liberation, he was a poor, illiterate carpenter. After liberation, under the cultivation of the Party, he became a vanguard in tool reform.
        Fanciful Ideas
    Not long ago, Liu Fangjiu manufactured a rope-pulled double-track train, which increased the efficiency of soil transportation by more than ten times. However, when he saw that pushing carts up the dam was too strenuous—one cart of soil required two people to pull and one to push, taking several minutes to reach the top of the dam—people's clothes were soaked with sweat, and they couldn't push much soil up in a day. So, he thought, "If I could make a soil-carrying waterwheel to transport the soil from the foot of the dam to the top." That night, as soon as he lay down, he thought about making a "soil-carrying waterwheel." Unable to sleep, he sat up, smoking and gesturing with his hands on the bed. Having been a carpenter for twenty years, he had made every kind of waterwheel—hand-cranked, foot-pedaled, dragon-bone, new-style, iron-ox-driven—which hadn't he made? But what would this "soil-carrying waterwheel" look like? How should it be made? Liu Fangjiu was stumped.
    The next day, Liu Fangjiu went back to the construction site to install the rope-pulled double-track train. He kept looking at the dam getting higher and higher, the road getting harder and harder; but the people were not intimidated by the difficulties, their enthusiasm was even greater, and the labor competition on the construction site was in full swing. People were determined to complete the reservoir a year ahead of schedule. This made Liu Fangjiu even more excited, and the idea of making a "soil-carrying waterwheel" became more and more persistent.
    "If I put the dragon-bone waterwheel and the double-track train together, maybe it will work!" He buried himself in thought, gesturing on the wooden rails. After a few days, Liu Fangjiu felt he had a clue. Then, he hid in the work shed and worked for two consecutive nights, making a small "soil-carrying waterwheel." At breakfast, Liu Fangjiu talked to several carpenters, and everyone felt it was very novel. Thus, the small model of the high dam soil transporting winch was sent to the Party Committee.
      Design Defense
    Late at night, the cold was biting, and the Party Committee's technological innovation meeting was still in progress. Liu Fangjiu's small model of the high dam soil transporting winch was placed on the table. The model looked like a dragon-bone waterwheel, but the dragon bones on this waterwheel were not fitted with paddles, but were tied with exquisite little trains, and the wheels had two smooth little tracks made of bamboo strips. The two Party secretaries were intently watching the model, surrounded by many people.
    "Old Liu, how did you calculate that this waterwheel can transport so much soil in a day?" A enthusiastic civil work team leader asked the question he was most concerned about.
    "According to the shape of the dam, the soil-carrying waterwheel can be made twenty-one zhang long; every one chi and eight cun can be fitted with a small hopper car, so more than two hundred small hopper cars can be installed on the dragon bone; each small hopper car can hold thirty jin of soil, so one rotation of the dragon bone can transport more than one fang of soil. That's one calculation. The water pump is twenty horsepower and rotates one thousand five hundred revolutions per minute; the flywheel on the water pump motor is seven inches in diameter, so the flywheel can drive the dragon bone thirty zhang in one minute; the dragon bone is forty-two zhang long back and forth, so the dragon bone can rotate more than two times in three minutes, transporting more than two fang of soil. That's another calculation. Taking eight hours a day as four hundred and eighty minutes, transporting soil two fang in three minutes, transporting three hundred and sixty fang of soil in a day. That's the third calculation." Liu Fangjiu spoke very clearly.
    "The soil is too heavy, I'm afraid it can't be transported up?" Another civil work team leader asked worriedly.
    "It can be transported up completely. How much can twenty horsepower pull? According to calculations, it can carry even more!" Liu Fangjiu always called the winch a soil-carrying waterwheel, and he called transporting soil as soil-carrying, and he still calls it that now.
    One question followed another, and Liu Fangjiu explained in detail. Until everyone felt that there were no more problems, Party Secretary Huang Yougen, on behalf of the Party Committee, praised Liu Fangjiu's daring and capable communist style and decided to transfer ten carpenters to form a technological innovation group, with Liu Fangjiu as the leader, to start trial-producing the winch.
        Many Difficulties
    Three days passed, and the winch was installed on the south side of the main dam. On the day of the trial run, a trial run ceremony was also held. People were as happy as if they were celebrating a festival. Cadres and workers surrounded the winch circle after circle. When the trial run time arrived, the motor roared, and the winch's crawler flew, and the soil really flew towards the top of the dam like water. Liu Fangjiu's wish was realized, and the crowd surged like waves, making earth-shattering cheers.
    The winch's crawler was like a horse that had broken free, getting faster and faster, and the wooden wheels of the small train rubbed hard against the wooden rails. Soon, the wheels were worn out, the small train derailed, some jumped up and hit the flywheel, and some collapsed and hit the pillars, and the water pump was forced to stop. People kept sighing and gradually dispersed. Liu Fangjiu's face became like a dark cloud, but he quickly calmed down and repaired the winch with his team members. After repairing, he started it again, and after crashing, he repaired it again. On this day, Liu Fangjiu suffered more than a dozen failures. In the evening, the technological innovation group discussed the accidents that occurred during the day and proposed several improvement methods, but the experiment still failed the next day. The technological innovation meeting studied for another night, and before dawn, everyone ran to the dam to experiment again, but the results were still not good. At this time, some members of the technological innovation group also lost heart, and people could also see anxiety on Liu Fangjiu's face.
    At this time, the Party and the masses firmly supported Liu Fangjiu. The workers posted more than three hundred big-character posters and also chopped down a large amount of wood from the mountains, demanding that Liu Fangjiu continue the experiment. The Party Committee also held a meeting to help Liu Fangjiu summarize his experience, affirmed that the high dam soil transporting winch was basically successful, and demanded that everyone focus on the speed of the flywheel; and resolutely criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, which enabled Liu Fangjiu to regain his spirit after many failed experiments.
        Sudden Realization
    "Secretary Huang is right, since the soil-carrying waterwheel can transport soil, it is basically considered successful. If the flywheel turns too fast, you can find a way to slow it down." After Liu Fangjiu returned to the construction site from the Party Committee, the few words spoken by Secretary Huang in his concluding remarks kept circling in his mind. How can the flywheel be slowed down? Liu Fangjiu thought for several nights. When Liu Fangjiu found that the flywheel on the motor was turning two thousand revolutions while the winch's dragon bone was only turning one revolution, he suddenly realized and said, "If I increase the diameter of the flywheel on the winch several times, wouldn't that make the flywheel on the motor turn slower?" He couldn't help but laugh.
    The next day, Liu Fangjiu reported to the Party Committee, and the Party Committee agreed to let them experiment again. With the enthusiastic assistance of the pump operator, the effect was indeed very good, the small train was running quietly on the track, and a large amount of soil was transported to the top of the dam. People cheered again. However, when the car was running continuously, accidents occurred again: the dragon bone made of lead wire slid from the middle to the edge again; the small train was forced to leave the track and collided with the flywheel again. Such accidents happened continuously eight or nine times in a day. But after more than one hundred failures, Liu Fangjiu finally made the high dam soil transporting winch.
    Now, on the main dam construction site of the Ziyunshan Reservoir, from the foot of the dam to the top of the dam, high dam soil transporting winches are all over, and the situation of workers pushing soil to the dam can no longer be seen on the entire construction site.

    刘芳九创高坝运土卷扬机
    本报记者　梅国宝
    江西省丰城县紫云山水库到处都使用开了木工刘芳九创造的高坝运土卷扬机，运土上坝的功效现在比人工运土提高了六十倍。
    刘芳九是丰城县袁渡公社社员，解放前是个一字不识的穷木匠，解放后在党的培养下成了工具改革的尖兵。
        想入非非
    不久以前，刘芳九制造了绳索牵引双轨列车，提高了运土工效十多倍。可是，当他看见推车上坝的人太费劲了，一车土要两人拉着，一人推着，好几分钟才能送到坝顶。人们的衣衫都湿透了，一天还推不上多少土。于是，他就想起来“要是做一部车土的水车，把土从坝脚车到坝顶上去”。晚上，他刚躺上床，就想起了做“车土水车”的事来。睡不着了，他坐起来抽着烟，用手在床上比划着。做了二十年的木匠，手摇的、脚踏的、龙骨的、新式的、铁牛盘的，哪一种水车他没有做过？可是，这“车土的水车”是个什么样？应该怎么做？却把刘芳九难住了。
    第二天，刘芳九又到工地安装绳索牵引双轨列车去了。他不时看看坝越来越高，路越来越难走；但是人们没有被困难吓倒，干劲反而更大，工地上你追我赶的劳动竞赛热火朝天。人们决心比原计划提前一年修好水库。这使刘芳九更加激动起来，做一部“车土的水车”的念头就越来越是放不下。
    “如果把龙骨水车和双轨列车凑在一块，或许能行！”他埋头思量，在木轨上比比划划。几天之后，刘芳九感到有点头绪了。接着，他躲在工棚里，连着干了两个深夜，做成了一个小小的“车土的水车”。早饭时，刘芳九跟几个木工一谈，大家都感到很新鲜。于是，高坝运土卷扬机的小模型便被送到党委会去了。
      设计答辩
    更深夜静，寒气逼人，党委会召开的技术革新会议还在进行着。刘芳九的高坝运土卷扬机的小模型放在桌上。模型像部龙骨水车，不过这部水车上的龙骨没有装叶子，却绑着精致的小小的列车，轮子上是两条用篾片做的光滑的小轨道。两个党委书记全神注视着模型，四周围坐着许多人。
    “老刘，这个水车一天能运这么多土，你是怎么算的？”一个民工团长兴致勃勃地提出了自己关心的问题。
    “根据坝形，车土的水车可以做二十一丈长；每隔一尺八寸可装个小斗车，在龙骨上就能装二百多个小斗车；一个小斗车装土三十斤，这样龙骨转个圈就可运土一方多。这是一笔账。抽水机是二十马力的，每分钟要转一千五百圈；抽水机马达上的飞轮直径是七寸，一分钟飞轮就能带动龙骨走三十丈；龙骨来回是四十二丈长，这样，在三分钟内龙骨就可以转二圈多，车土二方多。这又是一笔账。一天以八小时算是四百八十分，三分钟运土二方多，一天运土是三百六十方。这是第三笔账。”刘芳九谈得一点不含糊。
    “土太重了，怕运不上来吧？”又一个民工团长耽心地提出了问题。
    “完全可以车上来。二十马力能够拉多少东西？照算还可多车点呢！”刘芳九总是把卷扬机叫做车土的水车，把运土叫做车土，一直到现在他还是这么说。
    问题一个接着一个，刘芳九详细地解释着。一直到大家感到没有什么问题了，党委书记黄有根代表党委表扬了刘芳九敢想敢干的共产主义风格，并且决定抽调十个木工组成技术革新小组，由刘芳九担任组长，开始试制卷扬机。
        困难重重
    三天过去了，卷扬机被安装在主坝的正南面。开始试车的那一天，还举行了试车典礼，人们像过年过节似的欢天喜地，干部和民工一圈一圈地把卷扬机围了起来。试车时间一到，马达便发出轰隆隆的怒吼声，卷扬机的履带便飞奔起来，泥土真的像水一样的稀里哗啦飞向坝顶。刘芳九的愿望实现了，人群像海浪似的掀动起来，发出了惊天动地的欢呼声。
    卷扬机的履带像脱了缰的马，越来越快，木制的小列车轮狠狠地磨擦着木轨。不久，轮子就被磨坏了，小列车越轨了，有的跳了起来撞在飞轮上，有的塌了下去碰在支柱上，抽水机被迫停下来。人们不断地发出叹惜声，渐渐地散开了。刘芳九的脸变得像朵乌云，但是他很快就镇静下来，同组员一起抢修卷扬机。修好了又开动，撞坏了又修理。在这一天，刘芳九遭受到十几次失败，晚上，技术革新小组讨论了白天发生的事故，提出了几个改进的办法，第二天试验还是不行。技术革新会议又研究了一个深夜，天没大亮，大家便又跑上坝搞试验，结果还是不行。这时，技术革新小组的部分成员也灰了心，人们从刘芳九的脸上也可以看到焦急不安的情绪。
    就在这个时候，党和群众坚决地支持了刘芳九。民工贴出了三百多张大字报，还从山上砍下了大批木材，要求刘芳九继续试验。党委又召开了会议，帮助刘芳九总结经验，肯定高坝运土卷扬机基本上是成功的，要求大家在飞轮的快慢上做文章；并坚决批判了右倾保守思想，使刘芳九在多次试验的失败中，重新振作起来。
        恍然大悟
    “黄书记说得不错，车土的水车既然能够运土，基本上就算成功了。飞轮转快了，可以想办法让它转慢点。”刘芳九从党委会回工地后，黄书记在总结发言中说的几句话一直在他的脑子转圈。怎样才能叫飞轮转慢点呢？刘芳九想了几个深夜。当刘芳九发现马达上飞轮转二千圈而卷扬机的龙骨只转一圈时，他恍然大悟说：“我把卷扬机上飞轮直径加大几倍，那不就使得马达上的飞轮相应转慢了吗？”他不禁笑了起来。
    第二天，刘芳九向党委一汇报，党委同意他们再试验。在抽水机手热心协助下，效果果然很好，小列车安静地在轨道上跑着，大量的泥土被运上坝顶。人们又欢呼了起来。但是，当车子不断运转的时候，事故又发生了：用铅丝作的龙骨又由中间滑向边缘；小列车被迫离开轨道，又与飞轮碰了头。这样的事故，一天中连续发生了八、九次。但经过一百多次失败，刘芳九终于制成了高坝运土卷扬机。
    现在，紫云山水库的主坝工地上，从坝脚到坝顶，满布着高坝运土卷扬机，整个工地上再也看不到民工推土上坝的状况了。
