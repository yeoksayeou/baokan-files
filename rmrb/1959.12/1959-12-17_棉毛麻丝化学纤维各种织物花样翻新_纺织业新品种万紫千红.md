Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: China's textile industry continued its leap forward this year, producing and trial-manufacturing thousands of new designs and varieties. These new products include fabrics made from cotton, wool, linen, silk, and chemical fibers. The majority of new products, such as the novel "Celebrating the Harvest," "House Full of Red," "A Hundred Flowers Blooming" printed cotton cloths, the magnificent "Happy Xinjiang" printed cloth, and "Peacock Brocade," as well as the seven-color embroidered cloth and skirt cloth with ethnic minority styles, all reflect the flourishing new atmosphere of our country and the rich and colorful lives of the people in their patterns and colors.

According to preliminary statistics, Shanghai's textile factories alone trial-produced more than 6,000 new designs and varieties from January to August this year. Beijing's textile and dyeing factories trial-produced hundreds of new designs and varieties before National Day, with more than 200 put into production. Among the thousands of new designs and varieties trial-produced in Liaoning Province, over a thousand have been trial-marketed and produced after being assessed within the province. Guangdong Province trial-produced more than 700 varieties in the second quarter alone. Other regions have also trial-produced many new designs and varieties.

In terms of dyeing and printing technology, China has adopted a new dyeing and printing method this year. Printed cotton cloth made with this new technology has extremely vivid and natural patterns, resembling sketches. The high-grade jacquard poplin dyed by Tianjin's textile factories using domestically produced reactive dyes is more vibrant and of better quality than those dyed with ordinary dyes. A type of double-strand jacquard cloth treated with hydrogen peroxide is pure white and does not yellow. There is also a type of rayon fabric treated with resin, which is elastic, wrinkle-resistant, and resembles woolen fabric.

The time-honored high-grade fabrics such as brocade, Xiangyun yarn, and summer cloth have also seen new developments in textile technology and designs this year. With the adoption of electrostatic flocking and the latest printed interwoven flower methods, the famous "Beijing Satin" has even more gorgeous new varieties this year. The Xiangyun yarn produced in the past was only available in black and brown. This year, it is possible to produce Xiangyun yarn in various colors and prints, while still maintaining its original cool, breathable, and water-resistant characteristics. In the past, summer cloth woven from ramie in our country only had 36-count yarn and plain weave. This year, the Guangdong Ramie Factory has improved its spinning technology and can now spin 43-count yarn summer cloth. Clothes made from this summer cloth are cooler and more beautiful than the famous Jiangxi summer cloth. In addition, textile workers have also woven double-sided twill ramie fabric for making suits using ramie. An Dong City Silk Factory No. 1 has this year produced chiffon as thin as cicada wings using tussah silk.

Among the new designs and varieties, cotton textiles account for the largest number. Cotton fabrics for sewing various clothes, skirts, bedsheets, curtains, etc., have new designs and varieties this year. These new varieties include printed jacquard fabrics, extremely fine 150-count printed poplin, thin printed voile, etc. The average number of colors in general printed cotton cloth is more than four or five, with some reaching more than a dozen. This year, the variety of cotton cloth patterns and the richness of colors have exceeded those of previous years, and the quality has also improved.

There are also a considerable number of new varieties of wool textiles and various fiber blends. The National Wool Textile New Products Appraisal Conference this year has selected more than 20 varieties from more than 200 new products for mass production. The worsted gabardine produced by Shanghai No. 2 Wool Textile Factory is particularly soft, with good pattern and luster. The worsted and yarn spun from artificial wool and wool blends by Beijing's synthetic fiber factory are also of good quality. In terms of silk, Ma Zugen, a designer at the Hangzhou Victory Silk Sample Factory, successfully designed Dongfeng silk last year. This year, he designed peony brocade, double phoenix brocade, and nylon sofa cloth. The latter is a variety that has never been seen before in the history of Chinese brocade craftsmanship.

Many of this year's new varieties are designed for the vast number of people in rural areas. The designers fully considered the issues of durability, elegance, smoothness, colorfastness, and reduced shrinkage to meet the needs of the peasant masses. The quantity and variety of knitwear needed in large quantities in rural areas have increased this year. Shanghai alone has produced hundreds of types of fleece sweaters and undershirts with open-front, flat collars, zippers, and round necks. (Attached picture)

The state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory has completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule. This factory has produced more than 300 new varieties this year, an increase of about 50% over last year.

    棉毛麻丝化学纤维各种织物花样翻新
    纺织业新品种万紫千红
    新华社16日讯　我国纺织工业今年继续跃进，又生产和试制了成千上万种新花色品种。这些新品种包括棉、毛、麻、丝和化学纤维等各种纤维织物。大多数新产品，如新颖的“庆丰收”“满堂红”“百花齐放”花布、绚丽的“欢乐的新疆”花布和“孔雀锦”，具有少数民族风格的七色刺绣布和裙子布等，在花型和色彩上都反映了我国欣欣向荣的新气象和人民丰富多彩的生活。
    据初步统计，上海各纺织厂今年1月到8月即试制出六千多种新花色品种。北京市的纺织厂和印染厂在国庆前试制出几百种新花色品种，投入生产的有二百多种。辽宁省试制的几千种新花色品种中，经省内鉴定后试销、生产的已有上千种。广东省在第二季度就试制出七百多种。其他各地试制的新花色品种也很多。
    在印染技术上，我国今年又采用了一种新的印染法，用这种新技术印成的花布，花纹极其生动自然，好像写生画一样。天津市纺织工厂用我国自制的活性染料染出来的高级提花府绸，比一般染料染出的更鲜艳，质量更好。有一种用双氧水处理过的双条提花布，颜色洁白，不会泛黄。还有一种采用树脂整理过的人造棉织物，具有弹性，不易绉，很像毛织物。
    历史悠久的高级织物如锦缎、香芸纱、夏布等，今年在纺织技术和花色品种方面也有新发展。由于采用了静电植绒法和最新的印花套织花法，著名的“北京缎”今年又有了更加华丽的新品种。过去生产的香芸纱，只有黑色和褐色的，今年已能生产各种颜色和印花的香芸纱，并且仍然能保持香芸纱原有的凉爽、透风、抗水等特点。我国过去用苎麻纺成的夏布，只有三十六支纱的和平纹的。今年广东苎麻厂提高了纺纱技术，已能纺出四十三支纱的夏布，用这种夏布做的衣服比有名的江西夏布还要风凉、美观。此外，纺织工人们还用苎麻织成了做西服用的双面斜纹苎麻布。安东市丝绸一厂今年用柞蚕丝制成了薄似蝉翼的乔其纱。
    新花色品种中，数量最大的是棉织品。供缝制各种衣服、裙子、被单、窗帘等用的棉布今年又有了新颖的图案和品种。这些新品种中有印花提花织物，有一百五十支纱的极精细的印花府绸，细薄的印花玻璃纱等。一般花布套色平均都在四、五套以上，多的达到十几套。今年棉布花样之多、色彩之丰富，都超过了往年，质量也有提高。
    毛纺织和各种纤维混纺的新品种也相当多。今年的全国毛纺织新品种评选会议，已从二百多种新产品中选出二十多种作为大量生产的品种。上海第二毛纺厂生产的精纺华达呢，特别柔软，花纹光泽都好。北京的合成纤维工厂用人造羊毛和羊毛混纺的哔叽和毛线质量也很好。在丝绸方面，杭州胜利丝绸试样厂设计员马祖根，去年设计成功东风绸，今年他又设计出牡丹锦、双凤锦、尼龙沙发绸。后者是我国织锦工艺史上从来没有过的品种。
    今年的新品种，很多是面向农村为广大人民设计的。设计人员充分考虑了耐穿、大方、光洁、不褪色、减少缩水率等问题，来满足农民群众的需要。农村大量需要的针织品，今年生产的数量大，花样多。仅上海就生产出开襟平领、拉链、圆领的绒衣和线衣几百种。（附图片）
    国营上海第一印染厂已提前完成全年生产计划。这个厂今年已生产了三百多种新品种，比去年增加百分之五十左右。
