　　Shanghai Zhichengxing Steel Products Factory Creates Miracles
    Starting with Pliers, Building New Machines
    Production Tasks Double This Year, Staff Reduced by One-Third, Annual Plan Completed 42 Days Ahead of Schedule
    (Our Dispatch) Shanghai Zhichengxing Steel Products Factory workers started with a few pairs of pliers, wrenches, chisels and other hand tools, and vigorously engaged in technical revolution, using indigenous methods to build dozens of machines and equipment such as "electric cranes," "foreign cranes," "light railways," "electric drill and saw dual-purpose machine tools," and lathes. These replaced workers' heavy physical labor, rapidly increasing production efficiency. The entire factory completed its annual plan 42 days ahead of schedule, achieving an output equivalent to three and a half people per person.
    Zhichengxing Factory is a factory specializing in cutting steel and iron plates supplied by other factories. The factory did not have a single technician. In addition to the only four shearing machines, the rest were just a few pairs of pliers, wrenches, and chisels. Among the factory's one hundred and twenty-seven employees, nearly one hundred workers specialized in handling steel plates with levers and shoulders. They carried steel and iron plates all day long to meet the needs of the shearing machines. When they encountered a steel plate weighing more than a thousand catties, it took more than a dozen people to carry it. This year, the factory formulated a plan to increase the output value by one-fold compared to last year. At this time, some people felt it would be difficult to complete the plan.
    In March, a technical innovation team headed by the factory's Party branch secretary was established. They analyzed that the key to production at that time was the high labor intensity and low production efficiency of carrying steel plates, which could not fully exploit the potential of the shearing machines. After the direction of technical innovation was clarified, the team posted the innovation topic on a specially set up "recruitment notice," calling on all factory workers to vigorously engage in technical revolution. Dozens of suggestions were then sent to the technical innovation team.
    After many twists and turns, and overcoming difficulties of all sizes, they made electric cranes and foreign cranes, and also made a dozen small iron cars, laying eighty-eight meters of light railway, so that the entire factory formed a complete set of simple railway transportation lines from the workshop to the material yard. In this way, nearly one hundred loading and unloading workers were liberated from heavy physical labor. The factory's output increased rapidly, with the shift output increasing from the original seven tons to a maximum of one hundred and three tons.
    After the complete set of lifting and transport equipment was put into production, the workers were not satisfied with the achievements they had made. Under the call of the Party branch to "arm ourselves," the factory was not only able to cut steel and iron plates, but also became a factory capable of repairing machines and manufacturing equipment, fundamentally changing the backward situation of having only a few pairs of pliers, wrenches, and chisels. The workers learned from their past experience in making "cranes" and "indigenous cranes" and searched everywhere for discarded materials. They renovated a scrapped lathe, making it the only lathe in the factory capable of processing parts; used the rusty lathe frame to modify it into an "electric drill and saw dual-purpose machine tool"; and collected some silicon steel scrap to create a "welding machine." Machines and equipment such as "foreign cranes," "flatbed trucks," "jib cranes," "steel bar transporters," and "weighbridges" were also successfully manufactured one after another.
    Now, the total number of employees in the factory has been reduced from one hundred and eighty-seven at the beginning of the year to one hundred and twenty-seven, completing the production plan of doubling the output compared to last year forty-two days ahead of schedule, achieving an output equivalent to three and a half people per person.

　　上海志成兴钢铁制品厂厂小志大创奇迹
    老虎钳起家　大造新机器
    今年生产任务增加一倍，人员减少三分之一，年计划提前四十二天完成
    本报讯　上海志成兴钢铁制品厂职工从几把老虎钳、扳头、凿子等手工工具开始，大闹技术革命，用穷办法造出了“电动行车”、“洋吊车”、“轻便铁道”、“电动钻锯两用机床”、车床等几十台（辆）机器设备，代替了工人笨重的体力劳动，使生产效率迅速提高，全厂提前四十二天完成全年计划，做到一个人抵三个半人。
    志成兴厂是个专门承接外厂来料裁剪钢材、铁板的工厂。厂里没有一个技术人员，除了仅有的四台剪床外，余下的只有几把老虎钳、扳头和凿子等手工工具。全厂一百二十七个职工中，有近百个工人专门用杠棒、肩膀跟钢板打交道。他们整天扛运钢材、铁板，供剪床生产的需要。碰到一块上千斤重的钢板，得花上十几个人扛抬。今年，这个厂制订了产值比去年增长一培的计划。这时候，有人感到完成计划有困难。
    3月，以厂党支部书记为首的技术革新小组成立了。他们分析了当时生产关键是扛运钢板的劳动强度高、生产效率低，不能充分发挥剪床的潜力。技术革新的方向明确以后，这个小组就把革新课题公布在特设的“招贤榜”上，号召全厂职工大闹技术革命。接着几十条建议送进了技术革新小组。
    经过许许多多次的波折，克服了大大小小的困难，他们制成了电动行车、洋吊车，还制成了十几辆小铁车，铺设了八十八米长的轻便铁道，使全厂从车间到运料场构成了整套的简易铁路运输线。这样，使全厂近百名搬运工人从笨重的体力劳动中解脱了出来。全厂产量迅速提高，班产量从原来的七吨，最高达到一百零三吨。
    在成套起重运输设备投入生产后，职工们并没有满足已经取得的成就。他们在党支部“自己武装自己”的号召下，使厂里不仅能够裁剪钢材、铁板，还成为一个具备检修机器、制造设备能力的工厂，根本改变了只有几把老虎钳、扳头和凿子等手工工具的落后面貌。职工们吸取了过去造“行车”、“土吊车”的经验，到处搜罗废弃的物资。他们把一台报废的车床整修一新，成为厂里唯一能加工零件的车床；用锈痕斑斑的车床架子，改装成“电动钻锯两用机床”；搜集的一些矽钢片零料，造成了“电焊机”。“洋吊车”、“平板车”、“横臂吊车”、“条钢运输机”、“地磅”等机器设备，也先后制造成功。
    现在，全厂职工从年初的一百八十七人减少到一百二十七人，提前四十二天完成了比去年产量增加一倍的生产计划，做到一个人顶三个半人。
