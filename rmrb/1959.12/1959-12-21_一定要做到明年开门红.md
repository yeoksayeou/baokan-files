　　The year 1959 has only ten days left. Since entering December, a large number of enterprises have completed their plans ahead of schedule and in an all-round way. The great vow of the Chinese people to achieve continued leap forward in 1959 on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958 is about to become a reality; the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year, three years ahead of schedule, will also be successfully realized. Now, 1960 is approaching day by day. In addition to those enterprises that have not yet completed their plans, they should seize the last ten days to strive to fully complete and strive to overfulfill the plan. The new task placed before the national workers is to rapidly prepare for a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in industrial production next year, especially for a flying start and an all-round red in the first quarter of next year.
　　Striving for a flying start and an all-round red in the first quarter of next year is a new goal of struggle that workers across the country have recently put forward to themselves. This is of great significance for realizing a better and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial production next year. If the first quarter is full of energy, the start is red, and the production level is relatively high, this will put the overall production situation in an upstream position and take the initiative, creating favorable conditions for the continued improvement in the next three quarters on this basis. In the past, some people always thought that the relatively large decline in production in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of the previous year was an "objective law." This understanding was obviously wrong. Except for a small part of our industrial production, such as the sugar industry and the salt industry, which are seasonal and whose production increases or decreases with the seasons, and a part of enterprises whose output or value of output in the first quarter is slightly lower than that of the fourth quarter due to the long production cycle of products, the vast majority are continuous. With the continuous understanding of the laws of production and the continuous improvement of production technology and organizational level, production can be stabilized and continuously increased. This is the law of development of our industrial production. The phenomenon of "high at the end of the year and low at the beginning of the year" in the past was mainly caused by human factors. For example, rushing to produce at the end of the year without considering making preparations for the production of the second year, coupled with ideological relaxation, thinking that "the new year is just beginning, and there is plenty of time," the production level has dropped significantly. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the national workers opposed right-leaning ideas and boosted their energy, which first began to change the phenomenon of "high at the end of the month and low at the beginning of the month," and then proposed to further change the phenomenon of "high at the end of the year and low at the beginning of the year." This is the working class's ambition to respond to the call of the Party and continuously leap forward.
　　In order to change the phenomenon of "high at the end of the year and low at the beginning of the year" and make the production in the first quarter of next year a flying start, it is necessary to do a good job in production preparation. Production preparation is as important as production itself. Comrade Mao Zedong often told us not to fight unprepared battles. Everyone knows that it is difficult to fight a battle well if you are unprepared, sharpen your guns at the last minute, and fight in a hurry. The same is true for production. We must do a good job in production preparation in order to take the initiative and be invincible. In the past period, workers across the country have done a lot of important preparatory work for realizing a flying start and an all-round red in the first quarter of next year. Especially since the National Industrial Production Conference in October, various departments, regions, and major enterprises have begun to discuss next year's production plans, arrange the supply of materials, prepare the raw materials and materials needed for next year's production, and solve transportation and other issues. It is only because the most important task for workers across the country at that time was to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule and in an over-all way, so the preparatory work for a flying start and an all-round red in the first quarter of next year has not yet become a widespread mass movement. Now, the task of completing this year's plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it has been finalized, and it is time to mobilize the broad masses of workers to prepare for a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward next year, especially to prepare for a flying start and an all-round red in the first quarter of next year.
　　In this mass movement to prepare for a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward next year, especially for a flying start and an all-round red in the first quarter of next year, the most important thing is to adhere to putting politics in command, combine with the discussion of the plan, do a good job in ideological preparation, and make the idea of realizing a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward next year, and the idea of a flying start and an all-round red in the first quarter of next year, become the idea of the broad masses. This is the key to whether we can do enough preparation. Now, the production arrangements for the first quarter have been basically finalized, and some enterprises are organizing the masses to launch debates. This is very important. Organizing a debate will have great benefits, enabling the broad masses of workers to more deeply realize the current extremely favorable economic situation and the infinitely bright prospects of socialist construction, so as to better combine the soaring revolutionary energy with the spirit of scientific analysis, and combine ambition with the concrete work of doing a good job. We must solve various specific problems through mass discussions, and arrange next year well, especially the production in the first quarter. While arranging production, we must also arrange the lives of workers, especially considering the New Year's Spring Festival holidays. We must not only ensure that there is no slackening due to the holidays, but also ensure that there is a combination of work and rest, so that the workers will be refreshed, in a good mood, and full of energy after the holidays to invest in the new battle.
　　On the basis of doing a good job in political and ideological work, we should quickly grasp the specific preparatory work in terms of materials, technology, and production organization. The most important of the material preparations is to reserve raw materials, materials, and fuel, overhaul equipment, and carry out necessary capital construction, such as improving in-plant transportation and strengthening key links. The technical preparation is mainly aimed at the new tasks and new production key points of next year, and to launch a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. This is the most important link in all preparations. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses to improve design, improve equipment, improve tools, promote various advanced experiences, train new workers, and accelerate the improvement of workers' technical level. The most important of the production organization preparations is to adjust the labor organization according to the new tasks, organize new assembly lines, formulate new operating procedures, and so on. In order to do a good job in these production preparations, in addition to relying on the efforts of the enterprises themselves, it is also necessary to greatly promote the spirit of cooperation between enterprises. The production preparation of each enterprise is linked to the production of other enterprises. For example, in order to reserve the necessary ore and coke, steel plants need iron mines and coal mines to mine more ore; in order for one factory to install a new equipment, other factories need to complete the equipment as early as possible; in order to transport the raw materials and equipment that should be transported as early as possible, the transportation department needs to seize the time before the new year to transport more and faster. Therefore, in addition to doing a good job in the production preparation of its own enterprise for next year, each enterprise must also promote the spirit of cooperation and meet the requirements put forward by brother enterprises to do a good job in production preparation for next year. In this regard, the tasks of mining enterprises, machinery enterprises, and transportation enterprises are particularly important.
　　The new year is coming soon. After the great leap forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959, the situation in our country is extremely good, and the people of the whole country are full of confidence in the infinitely bright prospects. The correctness of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the guidelines, policies, and working methods that embody the spirit of the general line have been proved by the great practice of the past two years, and have been grasped by the broad masses, becoming the material force to accelerate the socialist construction of our country. As long as we grasp the favorable situation, advance victoriously, continue to exert our efforts, strive for the upstream, do a good job in all preparations, and make every effort to realize a flying start and an all-round red in the first quarter of next year, and strive for stable and continuous rise in production throughout the year on this basis, we will surely be able to realize a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in 1960!

### 一定要做到明年开门红

　　一定要做到明年开门红
    1959年只剩下最后十天的时间了。进入12月以来，每天都有大批的企业提前全面完成计划。我国人民在1958年大跃进的基础上实现1959年继续跃进的伟大誓言，即将变成事实；党的八届八中全会提出的提前三年在今年内完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召，也将圆满地实现。现在，1960年一天天地接近了。除了那些还没有完成计划的企业，应该抓紧最后十天的时间，努力全面完成并争取超额完成计划之外，摆在全国职工面前的新的任务，就是迅速为明年工业生产更好更全面的继续跃进、特别是为明年第一季度工业生产的开门红、全面红做好准备。
    争取明年第一季度开门红、全面红，这是最近一个时期全国职工向自己提出来的一个新的奋斗目标。这对于实现明年工业生产更好更全面的跃进具有重大意义。第一季度干劲鼓得足，开门就红，生产水平比较高，这就使全年生产的形势居于上游，取得了主动，为以后三个季度在这基础上的继续提高，创造了有利的条件。过去，有些人总以为第一季度生产比上年第四季度下降较多是一种“客观规律”，这种认识显然是错误的。我们的工业生产，除了一小部分，如制糖工业、制盐工业有季节性，生产随着季节的不同有增有减，还有一部分企业由于产品生产周期较长等原因，第一季度较第四季度的产量或产值稍有降低以外，其他绝大部分都是连续性的，随着人们对生产规律的不断认识和生产技术水平、组织水平的不断提高，生产完全可以稳定地、持续地上升的。这是我们的工业生产发展的规律。过去所以有“年末高、年初低”的现象，主要是人为的因素造成的。例如，年末突击生产，没有顾及为第二年的生产做好准备，再加上思想上松懈，以为“新年伊始，来日方长”，于是生产水平就显著下降。党的八届八中全会以后，全国职工反右倾、鼓干劲，首先使“月末高、月初低”的现象开始有了改变，随后就提出更进一步改变“年末高、年初低”的现象，这是工人阶级响应党的号召，不断跃进的雄心壮志。
    为了改变“年末高、年初低”的现象，使明年第一季度的生产开门红，必须做好生产准备工作。生产准备工作同生产本身一样的重要。毛泽东同志经常告诉我们不要打无准备之仗。谁都知道，打仗而无准备，临阵磨枪，仓促应战，是很难把仗打好的。生产也是一样。必须做好生产准备工作，才能掌握主动，立于不败之地。过去一个时期，全国职工已经为实现明年第一季度开门红、全面红，做了许多重要的准备工作，特别是从10月间全国工业生产会议以后，各部门、各地区、各主要企业都开始讨论明年的生产计划，安排物资的供应，准备明年生产所需要的原料、材料，解决运输等问题。只是由于当时对全国职工来说，最主要的任务还是提前和超额全面完成今年的计划，因而为明年第一季度的开门红，全面红做准备工作还没有成为广泛的群众运动。现在，提前和超额完成今年计划的任务已成定局，这就到了应该把广大职工群众发动起来，准备明年更好更全面的继续跃进，特别是准备明年第一季度开门红、全面红的时候了。
    在这个为明年更好更全面的继续跃进特别是为明年第一季度开门红、全面红做好准备的群众运动中，最重要的是坚持政治挂帅，结合讨论计划，做好思想上的准备工作，使明年要实现更好更全面的继续跃进的思想，和明年第一季度开门红、全面红的思想，成为广大群众的思想。这是能不能做好充分的准备的关键。现在，第一季度的生产安排大体上都定了下来，有些企业正组织群众展开辩论。这是十分重要的。组织一次辩论，会有很大的好处，能使广大职工更深刻地认识到当前极其有利的经济形势和社会主义建设事业无限美好的前景，从而更好地把冲天的革命干劲和科学分析的精神结合起来，把雄心壮志和切实作好具体的工作结合起来。要通过群众性的大讨论，解决各种具体问题，很好地安排明年，首先是第一季度的生产。在安排生产的同时，还要安排职工的生活，特别要考虑到新年春节的休假，既要做到不因休假而产生松劲，又要做到有劳有逸，使职工们在休假后个个精神抖擞，心情舒畅，精力充沛地投入新的战斗中去。
    在做好政治思想工作的基础上，应该迅速抓紧物质上的、技术上的和生产组织上的各项具体准备工作。物质上的准备工作，最重要的是储备原料、材料、燃料，检修设备，进行必要的基本建设，如改善厂内运输、加强关键环节等等。技术上的准备工作，主要是针对明年新的任务和新的生产关键，大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。这是所有准备工作中的最重要的一环。要充分发动群众改进设计、改进设备、改进工具，推广各种先进经验，训练新工人，加快提高工人的技术水平等。生产组织上的准备工作，最重要的是根据新的任务调整劳动组织，组织新的流水作业线，制定新的工艺规程等等。为了做好这些生产准备工作，除了依靠企业本身的努力之外，还要大大发扬企业之间的协作精神。每一个企业的生产准备工作都同另一些企业的生产联系在一起。例如，钢铁厂为了储备必要的矿石和焦炭，就需要铁矿和煤矿采出更多的矿石来；这一个工厂为了安装一台新的设备，就需要其他工厂及早把设备配套齐全；为了把应该运到的原材料和设备及早运到，就需要运输部门抓紧年前的时间多运、快运。因此，每一个企业除了做好本企业明年的生产准备工作以外，还要发扬协作精神，满足兄弟企业做好明年生产准备工作所提出来的要求。在这方面，采掘企业、机械企业和运输企业的任务特别重大。
    新的一年快要来到了。经过1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进，我国的形势极为良好，全国人民对于无限美好的前景充满了信心。党的社会主义建设总路线和体现总路线精神的方针、政策和工作方法的正确性，都已经被两年来的伟大的实践所证明，并且为广大群众所掌握，成为加快我们国家社会主义建设的物质力量。只要我们把握有利形势，乘胜前进，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，做好一切准备工作，尽一切努力实现明年第一季度开门红，全面红，并且在这个基础上力争全年生产稳定地、持续地上升，我们就一定能在1960年实现更好更全面的继续跃进！
