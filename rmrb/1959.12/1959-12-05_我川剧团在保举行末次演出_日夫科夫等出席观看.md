Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 4th. The Chinese Sichuan Opera Troupe gave its last performance of its visit to Bulgaria at the People's Opera House in Sofia on the evening of the 3rd.

That evening, the Sichuan Opera Troupe performed the full-length play "The Story of Fu Nu," which was warmly welcomed by the audience. At the end of the performance, thunderous applause filled the hall.

First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Zhivkov, and Chinese Ambassador to Bulgaria, Zhu Qiwenzheng, and others watched the performance.

Since its arrival in Bulgaria on November 19th for a performance tour, the Sichuan Opera Troupe has performed twelve shows in eight cities including Sofia, Pleven, Turnovo, Dimitrovgrad, and Plovdiv, with an audience of over 10,000 people.

During the performance tour, the actors also visited Bulgarian agricultural cooperatives and held special performances for workers. On the 3rd, all the actors of the Sichuan Opera Troupe visited the village of Airin Pilin in the suburbs of Sofia and the "Oriental Red" agricultural cooperative. After the performance, the actors had cordial conversations with the members of the "Oriental Red" agricultural cooperative.

Sofia newspapers published many articles praising the profound popular nature of Sichuan Opera and the acting skills of the performers. An article in the "Fatherland Front" newspaper said: "The Sichuan Opera Troupe attracts the audience with its simplicity and naturalness. It shows us the path it takes—the path of national culture serving its own people." An article in the "Agricultural Banner" newspaper said, "Although we do not understand Chinese at all, we are attracted by the wonderful performances of the actors. The Sichuan Opera Troupe's performance tour will help to further enhance the mutual understanding and fraternal friendship between the people of Bulgaria and China."

The Sichuan Opera Troupe will conclude its foreign visit and return to China on December 5th.

    我川剧团在保举行末次演出
    日夫科夫等出席观看
    新华社索非亚4日电　中国川剧团3日晚在索非亚的人民歌剧院作了访问保加利亚的最后一场演出。
    这天晚上，川剧团演出了大型剧目“芙奴传”，受到观众热烈的欢迎。演出结束时，大厅里响起了经久不息的掌声。
    保加利亚共产党中央第一书记日夫科夫和中国驻保加利亚大使朱其文等观看了演出。
    川剧团自11月19日到保加利亚进行访问演出以来，先后在索非亚、普勒文、第尔诺沃、季米特洛夫格勒、普罗夫迪夫等八个城市演出了十二场，观众达一万人以上。
    在访问演出过程中，演员们还参观了保加利亚的农业社，为工人举行了专门的招待演出。3日，川剧团全体演员访问了索非亚市近郊的艾林·彼林村，和“东方红”农业社。演员们在结束演出后，同“东方红”农业社的社员们进行了亲切的交谈。
    索非亚的报纸发表了许多文章，赞扬川剧的深刻的人民性和演员们的表演艺术。“祖国阵线报”的文章说：“川剧团以自己的质朴和自然吸引着观众。它向我们表明了它所走的道路——民族文化为自己的人民服务的道路。”“农业旗帜报”的文章说，“虽然我们完全不懂中国话，但却被演员们的精采表演吸引住了。川剧团的访问演出将有助于进一步增进保中两国人民间的相互了解和兄弟情谊”。
    川剧团将于12月5日结束在国外的访问回国。
