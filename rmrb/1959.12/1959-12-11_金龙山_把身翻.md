    "Golden Dragon Mountain" Turns Over
    Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Golden Dragon Mountain has undergone tremendous changes, and the bare mountain ridges have been covered with a layer of green.

    Golden Dragon Mountain is a large barren mountain in Huitong County, Hunan Province, with an altitude of more than 1,100 meters, a total length of twenty li, a width of about six li, and an area of more than 30,000 mu.

    At the beginning of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Huitong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to "Green Golden Dragon Mountain." Jinping, Xiaojia, Ma'an, Baozi, and other four townships immediately mobilized more than 2,600 commune members to form sixteen greening teams. Led by Comrade Dai Ping, the secretary of the County Party Committee, they marched toward the barren mountain. The rear departments also set off a wave of support for the greening army.

    The winter on Golden Dragon Mountain is particularly cold, and the overgrown weeds are frozen into ice pillars as thick as teacups; the raincoat draped over the body is also covered with layers of ice and snow. In the fifty days of reclaiming mountains and planting trees, there were forty days of rain and snow. Such harsh weather did not frighten the greening army. They put forward the resounding slogan: "Heavy snow and heavy rain are not as great as determination, high mountains and ridges are not as high as hoes," and fought against the severe cold with unparalleled heroism. They swept snow and broke ice on the high mountains, reclaimed barren mountains, and launched competitions with each other. Sixteen youth shock team members cultivated thirty-six mu of youth forest in one night. The women's shock team also refused to fall behind, and twenty-four people cultivated "one hundred mu of women's forest" in a very short time, and were rated as the first place in the model evaluation meeting. Communist Party member Liang Zibao, under the leadership of the Party branch at the construction site, implemented the contract system for afforestation, which doubled the efficiency and saved more than 33,700 workdays. Thanks to the commune members' soaring enthusiasm, after forty-seven days of hard work, more than 1.8 million neat rows of saplings were planted.

    After launching a mass land reclamation and afforestation campaign, it turned to a professional team to continue afforestation. After communization, even better conditions were created for further development of mountainous areas: roads were built in mountainous areas, and transportation became more convenient; over the past year, more than 11,000 mu of trees have been planted on Golden Dragon Mountain, and 60% of the 19,000 mu of suitable afforestation area has been greened. Now, the fir saplings planted last year are more than five feet tall, and the tung trees have also blossomed and borne fruit. People sing: The barren wilderness of Golden Dragon Mountain has turned over by vigorously greening; a barren mountain has become a sea of ​​forest, and happy songs are sung endlessly.

    山乡巨变
    “金龙山”把身翻
    自从去年大跃进以来，金龙山发生了巨变，光秃秃的山岗披上了一层绿装。
    金龙山是湖南省会同县的一座大荒山，海拔一千一百多米，全长二十里，宽约六里，面积三万余亩。
    在大跃进的1958年初，中共会同县委发出“绿化金龙山”的号召，金坪、肖家、马安、堡子等四个乡，马上动员了两千六百多个社员，组成十六个绿化大队，在县委书记戴平同志的率领下，向荒山进军。后方各部门也掀起了一个支援绿化大军的热潮。
    金龙山上的冬天特别寒冷，丛生的杂草都结成茶杯粗的冰柱；披在身上的蓑衣也凝结着一层层冰雪。垦山造林的五十天中，雨雪交加的天气就有四十天。在这种恶劣的气候里，并没有吓倒绿化大军，他们提出：“雪大雨大没有决心大，山高岭高没有锄头高”的响亮口号，以无比的英雄气概，同严寒作斗争。他们在高山上扫雪破冰，开垦荒山，互相展开竞赛。十六个青年突击队员，一个晚上营造了三十六亩青年林。妇女突击队也不甘落后，二十四个人在很短时间内营造了“百亩妇女林”，在评模会上被评为第一名。共产党员梁自保，在工地党支部的领导下，推行了造林的包工办法，使工效提高一倍，节约了三万三千七百多个劳动日。由于社员们发挥了冲天的干劲，经过四十七天的苦战，栽上了一百八十多万株整齐成行的树苗。
    在开展群众性垦荒造林运动之后，即转入了专业队继续造林。公社化以后，为进一步开发山区创造了更加好的条件：山区修了公路，交通方便了；一年来，金龙山上已植树一万一千多亩，一万九千亩的宜林面积已经绿化了60％。现在，去年栽上的杉苗，已有五尺多高，油桐也已开花结实。人们歌颂道：荒凉野岭金龙山，大搞绿化把身翻；一片荒山成林海，幸福歌儿唱不完。
