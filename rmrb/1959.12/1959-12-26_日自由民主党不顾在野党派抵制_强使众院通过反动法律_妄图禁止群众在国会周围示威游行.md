　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 24th: The ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan today, with all opposition parties refusing to participate in deliberations and attend the plenary session of the House of Representatives, unilaterally passed a reactionary law prohibiting demonstrations around the Diet.

　　In order to suppress the mass movement of the Japanese people against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Nobusuke Kishi government described the Japanese people's petition to the Diet on November 27th to express their opposition to the revision of the "Security Treaty" as a "riot," and used this as an excuse to submit this reactionary law to the House of Representatives.

　　日自由民主党不顾在野党派抵制
    强使众院通过反动法律
    妄图禁止群众在国会周围示威游行
    据新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本执政党自由民主党今天在全部在野党派拒绝参加审议和出席众议院全体会议的情况下，单独通过了禁止在国会周围示威游行的反动法律。
    自由民主党和岸信介政府为了镇压日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的群众运动，把11月27日日本人民为表示反对修改“安全条约”而向国会请愿的行动说成是“暴乱”，并且以此为借口向众议院提出了这项反动法律。
