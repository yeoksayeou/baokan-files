The annual pig iron production plan was overfulfilled more than a month ahead of schedule, with a qualification rate of 99%, an average utilization coefficient exceeding one, costs below national targets, and labor productivity increasing several times - from fifty people smelting one ton of iron per day to nine people smelting one ton.

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 7th) The Yu County, Shanxi Province, iron smelting base, which developed from indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign techniques into a "small foreign group," has fully overfulfilled its pig iron production plan for this year, forty-one days ahead of schedule. This "small foreign group" iron smelting base was established only a year ago, and has already demonstrated enormous power in supporting construction and agricultural mechanization.

As of November 20th, the county's seven small blast furnaces, ranging from 0.5 to 50 cubic meters, had produced 31,411 tons of pig iron, exceeding the national plan by 0.04%. Other indicators also exceeded the standards stipulated by the state. The average utilization coefficient reached 1.07, double that of last year; the average pig iron qualification rate reached 99%; the cost per ton of pig iron decreased from 300 yuan to 190 yuan; and labor productivity greatly increased, from 50 people smelting one ton of iron per day last year to 9 people smelting one ton.

In this year's continued Great Leap Forward, Yu County's iron smelting enterprises have been consolidated and developed. In addition to building a new 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace this year, most of the effort was focused on technical transformation. In order to improve the quality of pig iron, a new coal washing plant with an annual output of 300,000 tons and ten simple No. 2 coke ovens were built. At present, the ash content of coke has been reduced from 20% to 13%. The factories and mines built last year have also gradually achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization; all the county's coal mines, which a year ago were manually drilling and mining coal, and manually loading and transporting it, are now using electric drills and electric winches to replace it in major coal mines. The site of last year's indigenous coke ovens now stands a semi-mechanized coke oven, which not only improves the quality of coke, but also extracts large amounts of coal tar. The ore workshops of all the county's coking plants have replaced heavy manual labor with ore crushers.

Persisting in the mass movement centered on technological innovation is an important measure to ensure that all economic indicators reach the national advanced level. The vast majority of the workers in the "small foreign group" factories in Yu County are farmers who only entered the factory last year. In order to improve the technical level of the workers, by learning from the advanced experience of brother factories and summarizing their own operating experience, they found the operating rules of small blast furnaces. Based on the summary of experience, the staff and workers of each factory and mine discussed and formulated a complete set of operating procedures. Mining workers ensure that ore grade is not less than 40% before leaving the mine; charging workers ensure that raw materials are carefully selected and the particle size is qualified before entering the furnace; and furnace workers maintain the "three mouths" (iron mouth, tuyere, slag mouth). Due to the continuous summary and promotion of operating experience, the technical workforce has grown rapidly. Before last year, there was only one seventh-grade technician in the county, and now more than one hundred technical workers who can operate independently have been developed. With the improvement of technical level, all the small blast furnaces in the county have achieved high yield, high quality, and low cost. Before May this year, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces averaged around 0.5, and after August it reached above 1. During the same period, the pig iron qualification rate increased from 97% to over 99%. Some small blast furnaces have maintained 100% for a long time, and various indicators have caught up with the level of large blast furnaces. On the basis of high quality and high yield, in the second half of this year, all the county's employees carried out mass cost analysis activities, established and improved financial systems, and exchanged experiences in reducing raw material consumption, so that the cost per ton of pig iron was reduced to below 200 yuan.

Vigorously developing "small foreign group" iron smelting has driven the great development of the county's entire industry. From the national mass steelmaking campaign last year to the present, the county has produced nearly 100,000 tons of pig iron. In addition to completing the allocation tasks according to plan, a batch of indigenous machine tools have also been made from indigenous iron. The Wu-Wu Machinery Factory used indigenous iron to make simple machine tools, and used simple machine tools to manufacture complete sets of blast furnace equipment and small rails. This year, they used the gray pig iron they smelted to manufacture power machinery and equipment such as motors, water pumps, and small steel mills. At the same time, the power and transportation industries have also developed rapidly. In particular, last year, using self-cast and modified rails and indigenous trains, a 4.5-kilometer indigenous railway was built, opening up new avenues for mountain area construction.

    盂县小高炉全面完成计划
    产铁年计划提前一个多月超额完成，合格率达到99％，平均利用系数超过一，成本在国家指标以下，劳动生产率提高好几倍、由五十人一天炼一吨铁减少到九人炼一吨
    本报太原7日电　土法上马，土洋结合发展成“小洋群”的山西省盂县炼铁基地，已提前四十一天全面超额完成了今年的生铁生产计划。这个“小洋群”炼铁基地诞生只一年，就在支援建设和农业机械化中显示出了巨大的威力。
    截至11月20日止，全县七座零点五至五十立方米的小高炉已生产出三万一千四百一十一吨生铁，超过国家计划0.04％。其他各项指标也都超过了国家规定的标准。利用系数平均达到一点零七，比去年提高了一倍；生铁合格率平均达到99％；每吨生铁的成本由三百元降低到一百九十元；劳动生产率大大提高由去年的五十人一天炼一吨铁减少到九个人炼一吨。
    在今年的继续跃进中，盂县的炼铁企业得到了巩固和发展。今年除新建了一座十三立方米的小高炉外，大部分力量是集中在技术改造方面。为了提高生铁质量，新建了一座年产三十万吨的洗煤厂和十座简易二号焦炉。目前焦炭灰分已由20％降低到13％。去年建成的厂矿也逐步实现了机械化、半机械化；全县各个煤矿，一年前都是人工打眼采煤，人工装运；现在主要煤矿都用电钻和电机绞车代替了。去年的土法炼焦炉场地，矗立起半机械化的焦炉，不仅提高了焦炭质量，还提炼出了大量的煤焦油。全县各个炼焦厂的矿石车间用矿石粉碎机代替了繁重的体力劳动。
    坚持以技术革新为中心的群众运动，是保证各项经济指标都达到全国先进水平的一项重要措施。盂县“小洋群”工厂的工人，绝大部分是去年才进厂的农民。为了提高工人的技术水平，通过边学习兄弟厂的先进经验，边总结自己的操作经验，找到了掌握小高炉的操作规律。在总结经验的基础上，各个厂矿职工讨论制定出一套完整的操作制度。采矿工人做到矿石品位不到40％以上不下山；上料工人保证在原料入炉前做到精选，粒度合格；炉前工人维护好“三口”（铁口、风口、渣口）。由于不断总结和推广操作经验，工人技术队伍迅速成长。去年以前，全县只有一个七级技工，现在能独立操作的技术工人发展到一百多个。随着技术水平的提高，全县小高炉都达到了高产优质低成本。今年5月份以前小高炉利用系数平均零点五左右，8月份以后达到一以上。在同一个时期内生铁合格率由97％提高到99％以上。有的小高炉长年保持了100％，各项指标赶上了大高炉的水平。在优质高产的基础上，今年下半年全县职工开展了群众性的成本分析活动，建立和健全了财务制度，并交流了降低原料消耗的经验，使每吨生铁成本降低到二百元以下。
    大搞“小洋群”炼铁，带动了全县整个工业的大发展。从去年全民大炼钢铁到现在，全县生产出近十万吨生铁。除按计划完成调拨任务外，还用土铁制成了一批土机床。五五机械厂用土铁做成了简易机床，用简易机床制造出了成套的高炉设备和小铁轨。今年又用自己炼成的灰生铁制造出电动机、水泵、小钢磨等动力机械设备。与此同时，电力、交通事业也有了飞速的发展。特别是去年用自己浇铸、改制的铁轨和土火车，建设了四点五公里的土铁路，给山区建设开辟了新的途径。
