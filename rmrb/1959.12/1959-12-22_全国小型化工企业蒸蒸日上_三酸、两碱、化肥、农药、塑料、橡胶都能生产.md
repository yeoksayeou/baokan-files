Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch: The "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" of the national chemical industry have greatly developed over the past year. In many places, to support industrial and agricultural production, a situation of "every county running chemical industry" has formed.

Most of the small and medium-sized chemical enterprises in various regions have developed rapidly from scratch and from small to large since the second half of last year. Over the past year, these chemical enterprises have not only produced a large number of chemical products, but also accumulated rich experience for the further development of the chemical industry. For example, before 1958, Hubei Province only had a few small chemical plants in Wuhan and Yichang producing sulfuric acid, tannin extract, and medicine. Since mobilizing the masses to vigorously run small chemical enterprises, every county in the province has chemical enterprises this year. At present, the total number of chemical products produced in the province has reached more than 1,000 kinds. In just a few months, Henan Province produced more than 480 billion jin of indigenous fertilizer and more than 3 billion jin of indigenous pesticides. The sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, rubber hose transmission belts, etc., produced by indigenous methods have accounted for 30% to 60% of the province's total output. Sulfur, potassium nitrate, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, and pyrite are all produced by "small indigenous groups" enterprises. In the past, Guizhou, Yunnan, and other places relied on other provinces for the supply of chemical products, and the freight alone for each ton of sulfuric acid cost 700 to 800 yuan. After establishing "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" chemical enterprises, the cost of each ton of sulfuric acid is no more than 200 yuan at most, which not only meets the needs of industry and agriculture, but also saves a large amount of transportation capacity for the state.

Since being established, many small chemical enterprises, due to mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution and improve business management, have significantly improved the quality of their products and continuously reduced production costs. The cost of the first batch of small sulfuric acid plants in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, has been reduced from the original 700 yuan or more per ton to about 200 yuan, and the quality has reached the national standard. The small synthetic ammonia factory with an annual output of 800 tons, recently created by the Dalian Chemical Plant, has provided an example for the large-scale development of the chemical fertilizer industry in various regions. It is estimated that all the investment in this factory can be recovered in just one year.

Through more than a year of production practice, people's mysterious views on running the chemical industry have been completely eliminated. In the past, some people believed that the technology of the chemical industry was complex, and only acids, alkalis, and indigenous fertilizers could be produced by "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups." Now, facts have proved that not only three acids (sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid) and two alkalis (caustic soda, soda ash), but even the synthetic ammonia industry and organic synthesis industry, which have high technical requirements, such as synthetic ammonia, phosphate fertilizer, potash fertilizer, furfural, alcohol, calcium carbide, synthetic rubber, organic silicon, epoxy resin, polyvinyl chloride and more than 100 kinds of chemical products, can also vigorously develop the "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" movement. Most of these products have now passed the "technical barrier." For example, the average alcohol consumption per ton of rubber in the styrene-butadiene rubber (a type of synthetic rubber) successfully trial-produced by the Beijing Chemical Plant No. 2 has been reduced from the original 20 tons to about 4 tons.

In order to further accelerate the development of the chemical industry and give full play to the supporting role of the chemical industry to agriculture, industry and other sectors of the national economy, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has successively held on-site meetings in Wuxi, Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Zhejiang and other places since May this year, respectively summarizing and introducing the experience of these regions in developing chemical industry "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups." At the same time, it has sent a large number of technical personnel to help small chemical enterprises in various regions to overcome the "technical barrier" and the "economic barrier."

### 全国小型化工企业蒸蒸日上  三酸、两碱、化肥、农药、塑料、橡胶都能生产

　　全国小型化工企业蒸蒸日上
    三酸、两碱、化肥、农药、塑料、橡胶都能生产
    据新华社20日讯　全国化学工业的“小土群”和“小洋群”，一年多来得到很大发展。很多地方为了支援工农业生产，已形成了县县办化工的局面。
    各地的中小型化工企业，大部分都是从去年下半年从无到有，从小到大地迅速发展起来的。一年多来，这些化工企业不仅已经生产出大量的化工产品，而且为化学工业的进一步发展积累了丰富的经验。例如湖北省在1958年以前，还只有武汉、宜昌两地有几个生产硫酸、栲胶、医药等的小型化工厂，自从发动群众大办小型化工企业以后，今年已经县县都有化工企业了。目前，这个省生产的化工产品总数已达一千种以上。河南省在短短几个月内，就生产了四千八百多亿斤土化肥和三十多亿斤土农药。用土法生产的硫酸、盐酸、胶管传动带等已占到全省产量的30％到60％，硫磺、硝酸钾、烧碱、硫酸和硫铁矿则全部靠“ 小土群”企业生产。贵州、云南等地过去依靠外省供应化工产品，每吨硫酸光是运费就要七百到八百元，建立“小土群”“小洋群”化工企业以后，每吨硫酸的成本最高也不过二百多元，既满足了工农业的需要，又为国家节省了大批运输力量。
    许多小型化工企业在建立起来以后，由于发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，改善经营管理，产品的质量已经显著提高，生产成本也在不断降低。江苏省无锡市第一批小型硫酸厂的成本已经从原来的每吨七百多元下降为二百元左右，而且质量达到了国家标准。大连化工厂最近创建的年产八百吨的小合成氨工厂，更为各地大规模地发展化学肥料工业提供了榜样。这个厂全部投资预计只要一年就能收回。
    通过一年多来的生产实践，人们对办化学工业的神秘观点已经彻底清除。过去有人认为化学工业的技术复杂，只有酸、碱、土化肥等可以搞“小土群”“小洋群”。现在事实证明，不光是三酸（硫酸、硝酸、盐酸）二碱（烧碱、纯碱），即使是技术要求很高的合成氨工业和有机合成工业，如合成氨、磷肥、钾肥、糠醛、酒精、电石、人造橡胶、有机硅、环氧树脂、聚氯乙烯等一百多种化工产品，也都可以大搞“小土群”“小洋群”运动。现在这些产品大部分都已在技术上过了“关”。例如北京化工二厂试制成功的丁纳橡胶（人造橡胶的一种），平均每吨橡胶的酒精消耗量已从原来的二十吨降低到四吨左右。
    为了进一步加速化学工业的发展，充分发挥化学工业对农业、工业及国民经济其他部门的支援作用，化学工业部从今年5月开始，就在无锡、大连、秦皇岛、浙江等地先后召开现场会议，分别总结和介绍了这些地区发展化工“小土群”“小洋群”的经验，同时派出了大批技术人员，帮助各地小型化工企业过好“技术关”和“经济关”。（附图片）
