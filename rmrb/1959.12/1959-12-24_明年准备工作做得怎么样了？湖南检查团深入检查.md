Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 21st: The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) dispatched a group of cadres to form an inspection team, led by Li Ruishan, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, to conduct in-depth inspections of the preparatory work for industrial production, capital construction, and transportation for 1960 in various regions, factories, and mines, focusing on workshops (work areas) and work sections, starting from the 20th. Party committees at the county (city) and factory/mine levels, in addition to mobilizing the masses for inspection, also generally organized inspection teams and groups to carry out inspections to ensure a "red start" for next year's production and "monthly red" in the first quarter of next year.

The Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC issued instructions on the 18th regarding the rapid and comprehensive launch of a major inspection of preparatory work in industrial production, capital construction, and transportation, resolutely achieving a "red start" for next year. The instructions stated that since the Provincial Party Committee proposed in early October to comprehensively advance and overfulfill this year's plan and create conditions for continued leaps forward next year, the preparatory work in various regions has been tightly grasped, progressed rapidly, and achieved great results, which is the basic aspect. However, the development of production preparation work in various regions, industries, and production units is uneven. It is worth noting that transportation is still a weak link in the current work and must be given attention by leaders at all levels. It is necessary to immediately mobilize workers throughout the province to conduct a major inspection of production preparation work, resolutely reverse the phenomenon of industrial production being loose at the beginning and tight at the end, rising sharply and then falling sharply, to achieve "red start" and "monthly red" in the first quarter of next year, and promote the continuous development of a new production upsurge. In its instructions, the Provincial Party Committee also made specific provisions regarding the scope and methods of inspection.

Currently, the vast number of workers on the industrial, transportation, and capital construction fronts across the province are striving to exceed this year's production targets while also seizing the time to carry out next year's production preparation work, greeting 1960 with full confidence.

　　明年准备工作做得怎么样了？
　　湖南检查团深入检查
    据新华社长沙21日电　中共湖南省委抽调一批干部组成检查团，由省委书记李瑞山率领，从20日起，到各地区、各厂矿深入车间（工区）、工段重点检查1960年工业生产、基本建设、交通运输方面的准备工作。各县（市）、厂矿党委除了发动群众检查以外，也普遍组织了检查团、检查组，进行检查，保证明年生产“开门红”和明年第一季度“月月红”。
    中共湖南省委于18日发布了关于迅速全面开展工业生产、基本建设、交通运输方面准备工作大检查，坚决实现明年“开门红”的指示。指示中说，自从10月初省委提出全面提前和超额完成今年计划，并为明年继续跃进创造条件以来，各地的准备工作抓得紧，进展快，成绩大，这是基本的一面。但是，各地区、各行业、各生产单位的生产准备工作发展是不平衡的，值得注意的是交通运输仍旧是当前各项工作中薄弱的一环，必须引起各级领导的重视，立即在全省范围内广泛发动职工，进行一次生产准备工作大检查，坚决地扭转工业生产上前松后紧、骤升骤降的现象，做到明年第一季度“开门红”“月月红”，促进新的生产高潮持续不断地发展。省委在指示中，对检查的范围和方法，也作了具体的规定。
    目前，全省工业、交通运输、基本建设战线上的广大职工，正一面力争今年超产，一面抓紧进行明年的生产准备工作，满怀信心地迎接1960年。
