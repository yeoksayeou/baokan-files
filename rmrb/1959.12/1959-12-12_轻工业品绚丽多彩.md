    Light Industrial Products are Splendid and Colorful
    ·Xining Blankets·
    The blankets woven by machines in Tianjin and Harbin are so beautiful! Does Qinghai Province, which currently has no machines, can weave blankets? Yes! The blankets woven by the Qinghai Provincial Wool Textile Factory using self-made indigenous machines, except that the designs are not as good as those of Tianjin and Harbin, their softness and luster are indistinguishable. If no one introduces them, people will mistake them for being from other places. The Qinghai Wool Textile Factory plans to produce one thousand in the fourth quarter of this year to meet people's needs.
      ·Colorful and Plain Carpets·
    The wool from Qinghai Province has long fibers and is very elastic, making it suitable for weaving carpets. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the Qinghai Provincial Velvet Processing Factory actively sent people to Tianjin to learn. Workers who only studied for two or three months returned and became masters, training apprentices on a large scale. Their hands moved non-stop on the indigenous carpet weaving machines, like flipping flowers, and carpets with various colorful and plain drum patterns were woven. After the workers trimmed and washed them to bring out the luster, beautiful carpets appeared before people's eyes. The flowers, birds, and butterflies on the carpets are very lively and lovely. The quality has reached export standards and is very popular abroad. In addition to this factory, there are two other factories in Xining City that can produce such carpets.
    ·Glass Instruments·
    In the Qinghai Provincial Light Industry Exhibition Hall, an old man was engrossed in watching the glass display stand, muttering to himself: "This glass tube is so strange, it's crooked inside like a snake. How is it made? So clever! So clever!" In fact, he has not yet seen that the current Qinghai Provincial Ceramics Factory, in addition to being able to produce serpentine condensers, can also produce fat extractors, beakers, graduated measuring cups and more than one hundred kinds of laboratory glass instruments, powerfully supporting the industrial construction of Qinghai Province.
      ·Plastic Products·
    In the past, people in Qinghai Province never dared to imagine that they could produce plastic products. But during the Great Leap Forward last year, the plastic industry was born in this place with a very weak industrial base. The workers used self-made indigenous presses to press out more than twenty kinds of plastic products of various colors, including bowls, buttons, lamp holders, as well as soap boxes, pencil boxes, plates, etc. Not only is the quality very good, but the styles are also very beautiful. Some of the raw materials for producing plastics have also been successfully trial-produced.
      ·Novel Leather Shoes·
    The Xinsheng Leather Factory has produced in batches leather shoes of good quality, novel styles, beautiful and durable. These leather shoes are not only popular with customers in this province, but are also sold abroad. This year, the factory will produce 10,000 pairs of leather shoes for export. (Attached picture)

    轻工业品绚丽多彩
    ·西宁毛毯·
    天津、哈尔滨用机器织出的毛毯多么漂亮！青海省现时还没有机器，能织出毛毯吗？能！青海省毛纺厂用自制的土机器织出来的毛毯，除花色比不上天津、哈尔滨等地的产品外，其柔软、光泽等已使人难以分辨了。如果没有人给介绍，人们准会误会是从外地来的。青海毛纺厂今年第四季度，准备生产一千条，供人们需要。
      ·彩素地毯·
    青海省的羊毛，纤维长，富有弹性，很适于织地毯。去年大跃进中，青海省绒毛加工厂积极派人去天津学习。只学习了两三个月的工人，回来就当师傅，大批地培养徒弟。她们的双手在土织地毯机上，犹如翻花似的动个不停，各种彩花、素鼓花的地毯织出来了，经过工人修剪、洗涤出光，一张张美丽的地毯就呈现在人们的眼前。地毯上的花卉、鸟、蝶，非常活泼可爱。质量已经达到出口标准，在国外很受欢迎。西宁市除这个厂外，还有两个厂能生产这样的地毯。
    ·玻璃仪器·
    在青海省轻工业展览馆里，有一位老大爷在玻璃展览台前看得出了神，并自言自语地说：“这个玻璃管多怪，里面还弯弯曲曲的像条蛇。是咋做的？真巧！真巧！”其实，他还没有看到，现在的青海省陶瓷厂，除了能生产蛇形冷凝器外，还能生产脂肪抽出器、烧杯、有刻度的量杯等一百多种化验玻璃仪器，有力地支援了青海省的工业建设。
      ·塑料制品·
    过去青海省人们连想也不敢想自己能生产塑料制品。可是去年大跃进中，塑料工业却在这个工业基础十分薄弱的地方诞生了。工人们用自己制造的土压力机，压出了各色的塑料制品二十多种，有碗、扣子、灯头，还有肥皂盒、文具盒、盘子等等，不仅质量很好，样式也很美观。生产塑料的原料，现在也有部分试制成功了。
      ·新颖皮鞋·
    新生皮革厂，成批生产了质量良好、式样新颖、美观耐穿的皮鞋。这些皮鞋不仅受到了本省顾客的欢迎，还运销国外。今年这个厂生产的出口皮鞋将达一万双。（附图片）
