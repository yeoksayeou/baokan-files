    A Model of Socialist Construction
    ——The Growth of a Socialist Labor Team in Czechoslovakia
    By Our Correspondent Lin Hai
    
    The Glorious Title

    We sat in the office of the Second Section of the Nosek Coal Mine. The early winter sun shone through the bright windows onto this not-so-large room. Everything in it was simple and unadorned. The microphone connected to the mine, the telephone, and various directional arrows on the desk indicated that this was a frontline command post for directing miners' production. However, as soon as one entered this room, one would be attracted by the beautiful yellow frame hanging on the wall. Inside the frame was a "Socialist Labor Team" certificate of merit. Under a huge picture of the factory building, the names of the forty-eight members of the Fiftieth Collective of the Second Section were neatly written.
    The Fiftieth Collective of the Nosek Coal Mine was not only praised for winning this title, which was envied by so many, but also because they were the initiators of the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" in Czechoslovakia.

    It was just a year ago, when the resolutions of the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party inspired all working people to strive for the grand goal of "completing socialist construction," the workers of the Nosek Coal Mine also responded to the Party's call with their outstanding production achievements. At the meeting celebrating the early completion of the 1958 production achievements, the then Fiftieth and Sixty-second work teams proposed the initiative to carry out this competition. Learning from the spirit of the Soviet workers in striving for the Communist Labor Team, they put forward the slogan of "working, studying, and living in a socialist way." This initiative quickly received a response from the working people of the whole country and developed vigorously throughout the country. At present, more than 8,000 collectives across the country are working hard to win this glorious title, and about 100 collectives have already received this honor.

    The Fiftieth Collective had always been advanced in production in the past, but to reach the level of a "Socialist Labor Team," the original achievements were clearly not enough. What kind of road did this collective experience, what difficulties did it overcome, and what achievements did it obtain as it moved towards a new height?

    "Everything is difficult at the beginning," this may be the law of every thing, and this collective has not avoided this difficult beginning. Comrade Baso, a group leader of the Fiftieth Collective, told us that now their collective lives like a big family, close and friendly, and no one wants to leave it, but in those early days, the situation was not like this. Then he narrated the past situation to us. In the past, this collective was divided into groups of two, and although production was good, it was very unbalanced, and there was not enough mutual concern. In particular, the coal seam conditions encountered by each group were different, so the miners often complained to each other. When digging coal, they did not overcome difficulties together, but held a mentality of gambling. If the coal seam was good, they would produce more, and if the coal seam was bad, they would produce less, so the income of the miners was also very disparate. When it was proposed to form a large collective and reorganize the labor organization, many ideological resistances were encountered, and many people did not believe that so many people could do a good job of production together.

    A New Height

    In this situation, how did the Fiftieth Collective begin to work? Comrade Rovi, the old section chief of the Second Section, told us that at that time, the leadership grasped an important point, that is, to establish mutual trust among the workers and explain to everyone the benefits of forming a large collective. After a series of work, there was indeed a significant change in production, and the imbalance in production began to disappear, and the plan could be completed every day. The facts educated people. From then on, when each shift encountered bad coal seam conditions, they could help each other and be considerate of each other, because everyone had established trust and believed that they were doing their best in production. In this way, the mood of mutual complaint was also reversed, and a new atmosphere of mutual concern was established throughout the collective. Old Section Chief Rovi emphasized to us that this was a very important change. In the past, people only cared about their own production, or at most the production of his group, but now caring about the production of the entire collective has become a very natural responsibility for everyone. This is a change in the relationship between people. The old section chief also said that over the past year, the members of this collective have become more mature under the education of collectivism, and their sense of ownership of the entire factory and mine has also been greatly strengthened.

    When we asked Kentzel, a member of this collective, about his experience over the past year, he said meaningfully that the deepest experience over the past year is that it is good to have more people, more ideas, and more experience. Everything can always find the best solution after everyone discusses it. And good experiences can also be spread more widely. He said somewhat shyly: "A year ago, when it was proposed to merge into a large collective, I did not agree, but now I have fallen in love with this collective. This collective not only produces well, but also lives together in friendship and harmony."

    Then, Comrade Rudolf, the chairman of the trade union, introduced us to the achievements of the Fiftieth Collective in terms of production. He said that there are two collectives in the Second Section. In the first nine months, the coal mining volume of the Fiftieth Collective accounted for 58% of the entire section. In the first nine months, they completed 110% of the plan. This section is now the best section in the entire mine, and there is no doubt that the Fiftieth Collective has played a significant role in it. This collective not only produces well, but is also a model for the entire mine in ensuring production safety and saving raw materials. Safety is a very important issue for miners. The Fiftieth Collective has done a very good job in this regard. They have not only strengthened safety education for workers, requiring everyone to strictly abide by operating procedures, but also established good site order, thus avoiding the occurrence of work-related injuries. In the first nine months, the Fiftieth Collective only had five minor injuries, and there were no accidents at all in September. This collective also paid great attention to savings. In August, they only used 87% of the prescribed amount of timber, while the best savings record in the past was only 97%. They have also created excellent results in organizing transportation and improving labor productivity.

    Regarding the issue of educating people, this is an important part of becoming a Socialist Labor Team. This collective has attached importance to this work from the beginning. There are almost no backward people in this collective now. Those who were originally backward have become people who meet the title of socialist labor team members with the help of advanced workers and Party members. When this collective proposed to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Team", there was a worker who was not only bad in production, but also backward in politics and ideology. A discussion was held on whether or not he should participate in this collective. Some said that he should not participate, and some said that the Socialist Labor Team has the responsibility to help transform people and should let him stay in the collective. The second opinion was adopted. This worker has now become a very good worker, and his name is also on that certificate. When we visited him, he excitedly told us that the Fiftieth Collective educated me, helped me, and made me a useful person.

    The Fiftieth Collective also pays great attention to family work. They know that their labor, work and study also need the help and support of their wives. At the beginning, the wives had some complaints because the members of this collective were busy with production, work and other activities, but since they vigorously carried out family work, the situation has been completely different. The Fiftieth Collective often organizes collective parties, visits, and forums with family members. The old section chief seemed very excited when he talked about this. He talked about how at a party, he represented the miners in expressing his gratitude to the wives, explaining that the achievements of this collective were inseparable from their help, and also explaining to them that to be a glorious socialist labor team member, one had to spend more time on production, social activities and study, so it was impossible to share too much housework for the wives, and he asked for their understanding in this regard. Many family members were deeply moved, and everyone unanimously expressed their willingness to support and help their husbands so that they could be more at ease in production and be able to be a true and worthy socialist labor team member.

    The example of the Fiftieth Collective working, studying, and living in a socialist way has not only aroused people's praise, but has also become an example to encourage other collectives to move forward. More and more collectives in this coal mine are striving for this glorious title. The old section chief said proudly that another collective in the Second Section is also working towards this goal, and they will soon reach this height. At that time, the entire Second Section will be socialist labor team members.

    We can understand the joy of the old section chief. What could be happier than seeing your own worker brothers constantly moving towards new heights?

    Always Moving Forward

    The Fiftieth Collective is never satisfied with its existing achievements. Sixteen of the forty-eight members of this collective are Party members. They are the core of this collective. They always drive the entire collective with their exemplary behavior. The members of this collective are constantly improving themselves in all aspects. Thirty-six of them hold social work positions. These works have politically trained them. They also actively participate in political and technical studies so that they can continue to improve in all aspects.

    After winning the title of Socialist Labor Team, the collective immediately created good results in the first two months of the fourth quarter. When discussing the 1960 plan and the prospects of the third five-year plan nationwide, they put forward many useful suggestions. Everything about them shows that they will not only maintain this glorious title, but will also hold high this banner and move towards newer heights.

    社会主义建设的标兵
    ——捷克斯洛伐克一个社会主义劳动队的成长
    本报记者　林海
    光荣的称号
    我们坐在诺塞克煤矿第二工段的办公室里。初冬的阳光透过明亮的窗子照耀着这间不算太大的房子，这里的一切都是简单朴素的，桌上摆着的同矿井联系的话筒，电话机和各种指示箭头，说明了这里是指挥矿工生产的一个前线指挥部。然而只要人们一走进这间房子，就会被墙上挂着的那个漂亮的黄色镜框所吸引。镜框里是一张“社会主义劳动队”的奖状。在一幅巨大的厂房的图景下整齐地写着第二工段第五十号集体四十八个队员的名字。
    诺塞克煤矿的第五十号集体不仅因为他们获得了这个为多少人羡慕的称号而为人们所称道，同时也因为他们是捷克斯洛伐克争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛的创议者。
    那正是一年前的冬天，当捷共第十一次代表大会的决议鼓舞着全体劳动人民为“完成社会主义建设”这一宏伟的目标而奋勇前进时，诺塞克煤矿的工人也以自己卓越的生产成就回答了党的号召。就在这个煤矿的工人欢庆提前完成1958年生产成就的大会上，当时的第五十号和第六十二号工作队提出了开展这一竞赛的创议，他们学习苏联工人争取共产主义劳动队的精神，提出了“以社会主义方式工作、学习和生活”的口号。这个创议很快就得到了全国劳动人民的响应，并且在全国各地蓬勃地开展起来。目前，全国已有八千多个集体正在为争取这一光荣的称号而努力，有约一百个集体已经得到了这份荣誉。
    第五十号集体过去在生产上一直就是先进的，但是要达到“社会主义劳动队”的水平，显然原有的成就是不够的，而这个集体在向着一个新的高度前进时，究竟是经历了怎样的道路，克服了一些什么困难和获得了一些怎样的成就呢？
    “万事开头难”，这也许是每件事情的规律，这个集体也同样没有避免得了这个困难的开端。第五十号集体的一个小组长巴索同志告诉我们说，现在他们这个集体生活得像一个大家庭一样，亲密友爱，谁也不想离开它，但是在开头的那些日子里，情况可不是这样。接着他向我们叙述了过去的情形。过去这个集体是两个人一小组，生产虽然还不错，但却很不平衡，互相间也不够关心，特别是各组遇到的煤层情况不一样，因此矿工们经常互相埋怨，在挖煤时不是共同克服困难，而是抱着一种碰运气的心理，遇到煤层好，就多生产一些，煤层不好就少生产一些，因此矿工之间的收入也很悬殊。当提出要成立一个大集体，重新调整劳动组织后，遇到很多思想抵触，许多人都不相信，这样多人在一块能够把生产搞好。
    新的高度
    在这样的情况下，第五十号集体是怎样开始工作的呢？第二工段的老段长罗维同志告诉我们，当时领导上抓住了重要的一点，即在工人中建立起相互的信任，向大家解说成立一个大集体的好处。经过一系列的工作，生产上果然有了显著的改变，生产不平衡的情况开始消失，每天都能完成计划。事实教育了人，从此，各班在遇到煤层不好的情况时，都能互相帮助，互相体谅，因为大家建立了信任，彼此相信都在尽力生产，这样，互相埋怨的情绪也扭转了，整个集体建立了一种彼此关心的新风气。罗维老段长十分强调地对我们说，这是一个非常重要的变化，过去人们只关心自己的生产，顶多是他这个组的生产，但现在关心整个集体的生产成了大家一种极自然的责任，这是一种人与人之间关系的变化。老段长还说，一年来，这个集体的成员在集体主义的教育下都变得更成熟了，他们对于整个厂矿的主人翁感也大大加强了。
    当我们问到这个集体的成员肯茨尔一年来的体会时，他意味深长地说，一年来，最深的体会是人多好办事，主意多，经验多，什么事经过大家讨论总是能找出最好的解决办法。而且好的经验也能得到更广泛的传播。他显得有些羞涩地说：“一年前，要并成一个大集体时，我就是不赞成的，但现在我却爱上了这个集体，这个集体不仅生产得好，而且互相生活得友爱融洽。”
    接着工会主席鲁多尔夫同志向我们介绍了第五十号集体在生产方面的成就。他说，第二工段有两个集体，在前九个月第五十号集体的采煤量占整个工段的58％，前九个月完成了计划的110％，这个工段现在是全矿最好的工段，无疑五十号集体在其中起了不小的作用。这个集体不仅生产好，而且在保证生产安全方面和节约原材料方面也是全矿的模范。安全问题对矿工来说是一个十分重要的问题。而第五十号集体在这方面做得非常好，他们不仅加强了对工人的安全教育，要求每个人严格遵守操作规程，而且建立了良好的工地秩序，因此避免了工伤事故的发生。在前九个月里，第五十号集体只有五个轻伤，而在9月份内就完全没有发生事故，这个集体还十分注意节约，在8月份内他们就只用了规定木材量的87％，而过去这个矿最好的节约成绩也只是97％。他们在组织运输、提高劳动生产率方面也都创造了优良的成绩。
    关于教育人的问题，这是成为社会主义劳动队的一项重要的内容。这个集体从一开始就重视这项工作，这个集体现在几乎没有落后的人，那些原来落后的人在先进工人和党团员的帮助下，都成为了符合于社会主义劳动队员称号的人。在这个集体提出争取“社会主义劳动队”的称号时，有一个工人不仅生产不好，政治上思想上也很落后，关于要不要他参加这个集体的问题，曾展开了一场讨论。有的说，不要他参加，有的说，社会主义劳动队就有帮助改造人的责任，应该让他留在集体里。第二种意见被通过了，这个工人现在已变成一个很好的工人，在那张奖状上也有着他的名字。在我们访问他时，他激动地对我们说，第五十号集体教育了我，帮助了我，使我成为了一个有用的人。
    第五十号集体也很注意家属工作，他们知道他们的劳动、工作和学习也需要妻子们的帮助和支持，在开始时，妻子们曾因为这个集体的成员忙于生产、工作和其它活动而有些怨言，但自从他们大力开展家属工作后，情况完全不同了。第五十号集体经常和家属们组织集体联欢、参观和座谈。老段长谈到这一点时，显得十分兴奋。他谈到在一次的联欢会上，他代表矿工向妻子们表示感谢，说明这个集体所取得的成就和她们的帮助是分不开的，同时也向她们解释做一个光荣的社会主义劳动队员就要花更多的时间在生产上、社会活动和学习上，因此就不可能为妻子们分担太多的家务劳动，这一点要请求她们的体谅。许多家属都深受感动，大家一致表示要支持和帮助自己的丈夫，使他们能更安心生产，能够作一个真正的名副其实的社会主义劳动队员。
    第五十号集体以社会主义方式工作、学习和生活的榜样不仅引起了人们的赞扬，而且也成为了鼓舞其它集体前进的榜样，这个煤矿愈来愈多的集体在争取这一光荣的称号。老段长自豪地说，第二工段的另一个集体也正在向这个目标努力，他们也会很快达到这一高度的，那时，整个的第二工段就都是社会主义劳动队员了。
    我们是能理解老段长的喜悦的，还有什么能比看到自己的工人兄弟不断向新的高度迈进更高兴的事呢？
    永远前进
    第五十号集体决不满足于已有的成就，这个集体的四十八个人中有十六个党员，他们是这个集体的核心，他们永远以自己的模范行为带动着整个集体。这个集体的成员都不断在各方面提高自己，他们之中三十六个人担任了社会工作，这些工作在政治上锻炼了他们，他们也都积极参加政治和技术学习，以使得他们在各方面都能不断得到提高。
    这个集体在获得社会主义劳动队的称号后，紧接着在第四季度的头两个月中又创造出了很好的成绩，在全国讨论1960年的计划和第三个五年计划的远景时，他们又提出了许多有益的建议。他们的一切说明了他们不仅将保持这一光荣称号，而且将高举这面旗帜向着更新的高度前进。
