Leap Forward Stage
Liu Zhang

This is a true story... Old locust tree, large stone platform, the tree is called Lazy Man's Tree, the platform is called Idler's Platform, year after year, generation after generation, during the busy seasons of spring planting and autumn harvest, there were always idlers lingering under the tree.

Mutual aid teams, elementary cooperatives, no more lazy people dawdling under the tree, the idler's platform is empty, girls read newspapers on the tree, and members hold meetings under the tree.

People's communes were established, and the thousand-year-old withered tree blossomed with red flowers, loudspeakers hung on the tree, and a "Leap Forward Stage" was built under the tree, good news spread through thousands of miles of radio waves, heroes compete on the arena, production enthusiasm is as red as fire, who still looks for lazy people, a three-year-old child waves his hand, please look at the honor roll, rows and rows of model lists...

Old locust tree, smiling face, branches and leaves swaying in the wind, praising our good commune, praising the new era!

    跃进台
    刘章
    这是一个真实的故事……老槐树，大石台，树叫懒人树，台叫闲人台，一年年，一代代，春种秋收百忙节，树下总有闲人呆。互助组，初级社，再没懒人树下呆，空了闲人台，姑娘树上读报纸，社员树下把会开。人民公社建起来，千年枯树红花开，扩音喇叭树上挂，树下搭起“跃进台”，千里电波喜讯传，英雄擂台来比赛，生产干劲红似火，谁再找懒人，三岁孩子把手摆，请看光荣榜，模范名单一排排……老槐树，笑颜开，枝叶迎风摆，夸咱公社好，赞美新时代！
