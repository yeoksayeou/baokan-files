Jiaxing Special District's Eight Silk Reeling Factories Partner with People's Communes
Help Silkworm Farmers Innovate Silkworm Breeding Techniques

(Our Dispatch) Eight silk reeling factories in Jiaxing Special District, Zhejiang Province, have partnered with people's communes, making every effort to fully assist eight production teams of local communes in constructing mechanized and electrified silkworm rearing and communal breeding rooms in terms of manpower, equipment, and technology, greatly promoting the technological transformation of silkworm rearing.

Jiaxing Special District has a relatively concentrated number of silk reeling factories, including Huzhou Silk Factory, Linghu Silk Factory, Zhejiang Silk Factory No. 1, China Silk Factory No. 3, Chongde Silk Factory, Shunfeng Silk Factory, China Silk Factory No. 1, and Yulun Silk Factory. These silk factories all have certain technical strength and machine repair workshops. In October this year, the Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to help the communes transform silkworm rearing technology, accelerate the realization of mechanized silkworm rearing, electrification, and strive for a greater bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons, instructed the silk factories to immediately partner with the production teams of the people's communes. The Party Committee Secretaries of each factory and the Party Committee Secretaries of the communes personally took charge, and absorbed technical workers and silkworm farmers to jointly form leadership groups or preparatory committees for mechanized and electrified silkworm rearing, drawing up specific plans and taking immediate action.

In helping the commune production teams build mechanized and electrified silkworm rooms, the silk factories resolutely implemented the policy of starting from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, and combining indigenous and foreign methods; focusing on repairing old equipment and supplementing with new construction. The employees cleaned up the warehouses overnight, looking for electrical equipment and waste materials; technicians, electricians, carpenters, and machine repair workers fought day and night, helping to design and manufacture various equipment; factory directors and Party Committee Secretaries also went to the countryside to provide personal guidance.

In the process of helping the communes with mechanized and electrified silkworm rearing, the workers cooperated with the silkworm farmers to carry out technical innovations. After Huzhou Silk Factory partnered with Longshan Production Team of Baique Commune, the leading personnel, technical workers, and silkworm farmers combined to create a three-purpose mulberry cutting machine that could be powered by electricity, hand crank, or foot pedal, increasing efficiency by two to three times compared to ordinary mulberry cutting machines. At the same time, twenty-four silkworm rooms were also built. These silkworm rooms have electric lights and fluorescent lights for lighting and photosensitivity, as well as mulberry cutting machines; some silkworm rooms also have electric furnaces and ceramic heating tubes for warmth, sprayers for wetting cloth, ultraviolet lamps for sterilization, and disinfecting steam stoves.

After the people's communes established mechanized and electrified silkworm rooms, they not only improved the yield and quality of winter silkworm cocoons, but also greatly saved labor. After Longshan Production Brigade had electromechanical silkworm rooms, the silkworm mounting period was half a month earlier than other production teams, and the output also increased by five to ten times.

Currently, these eight silk reeling factories are actively trial-producing and producing complete sets of mechanical equipment such as mulberry cutting, leaf feeding, and sand removal, preparing to support the communes in building more mechanized and electrified silkworm rooms, and laying the foundation for a greater leap forward in silkworm cocoon production next year.

　　嘉兴专区八个缫丝厂同人民公社挂钩
    帮助蚕农革新养蚕技术
    本报讯　浙江省嘉兴专区八个缫丝厂和人民公社挂钩，千方百计从人力、设备、技术上全面帮助当地公社的八个生产队修建了机械化电气化养蚕共育室，大大促进了养蚕的技术改造。
    嘉兴专区缫丝厂比较集中，有湖州丝厂、菱湖丝厂、浙江制丝一厂、中丝三厂、崇德丝厂、顺丰丝厂、中丝一厂、裕伦丝厂。这些丝厂都有一定的技术力量和机修车间，今年10月，中共嘉兴地委为了帮助各公社改造养蚕技术，加速实现养蚕机械化，电气化，争取蚕茧更大丰收，曾指示各缫丝厂立即同人民公社生产队挂钩。各厂党委书记和公社党委书记亲自挂帅，并吸收技术工人、蚕农共同组成养蚕机械化电气化的领导小组或筹备委员会，订出具体计划，立即行动。
    各缫丝厂在帮助公社生产队修建机械化、电气化蚕室中，坚决贯彻执行了从小到大，从土到洋，土洋并举的方针；以修旧为主，新建为辅。职工们连夜清理仓库，寻找电器设备和废物旧料；技术员、电工、木工、机修工日夜奋战，帮助设计和制造各种设备；厂长、党委书记也到农村亲自指导。
    在帮助公社搞养蚕机械化电气化过程中，工人们和蚕农配合，开展了技术革新。湖州丝厂和白雀公社龙山生产队挂钩后，领导人员、技术工人、蚕农三结合，制成了电动、手摇、脚踏三用切桑机，效率比一般切桑机提高二到三倍。同时，还修建了二十四间蚕室。这些蚕室都有照明感光用的电灯、日光灯和切桑机；有的蚕室还有保暖用的电炉、陶瓷加温管，布湿用的喷雾器，杀菌用的紫外线灯和消毒蒸汽灶。
    人民公社建立了机械化电气化蚕室后，不仅提高了冬季蚕茧产量和质量，还大大节约了劳动力。龙山生产大队有了机电化蚕室，上簇期比其他生产队提早半个月，产量也提高了五到十倍。
    现在，这八个缫丝厂正在积极试制和生产切桑、给叶、除沙等整套机械设备，准备支援公社修建更多的机械化电气化蚕室，为明年蚕茧生产更大的跃进打下基础。（附图片）
