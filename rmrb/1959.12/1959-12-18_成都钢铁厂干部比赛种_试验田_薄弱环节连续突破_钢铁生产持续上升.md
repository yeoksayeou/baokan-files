Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu: Leading cadres of the Chengdu Steel Plant are carrying out a competition in planting "experimental plots" to break through weak links in production and promote a sustained increase in steel production. Compared with September, in October, the month when the "experimental plot" competition began, steel increased by 134.3%, iron by 24.2%, and steel products by 55.2%. In November, steel products increased by another 41.6% compared to October, and iron increased by 21.1%, with significant improvements in quality.

Through the "experimental plot" competition, leading cadres of the Chengdu Steel Plant have further improved their working style. Now, all Party and government leading cadres above the workshop level in the plant are planting "experimental plots" in the four workshops of steelmaking, ironmaking, steel rolling, and coking respectively. They adopt the form of combining cadres, workers, and technicians, eating, living, and working with the masses, and through their own practice, grasp production rules, gain experience, and guide the plant's production in a timely manner.

In order to break through the critical issue of the short lifespan of converters, the Party Committee Secretary and the Deputy Director for Production went to the steelmaking workshop and, along with the workshop director and the Party Branch Secretary, took charge of four work sections respectively. Each person worked on an experimental furnace, set specific targets, and launched a competition, conducting timely evaluations, and summarizing and exchanging experiences. They not only presided over various production meetings, mobilizing workers to discuss plans and study specific measures, but also personally operated the equipment, working with the workers to overcome difficulties, ensuring every furnace was checked for wind eyes and every furnace's experience was summarized. In this way, from leaders to the masses, from cadres to workers, everyone was involved in the competition, causing the wind eye damage in the entire workshop to drop from over 100 millimeters to over 20 millimeters. The lifespan of the converters not only increased by more than 50% compared to the past, but also greatly reduced equipment accidents and production downtime.

    成都钢铁厂干部比赛种“试验田”
    薄弱环节连续突破　钢铁生产持续上升
    据新华社成都电　成都钢铁厂领导干部开展种“试验田”对手赛，突破生产薄弱环节，促进钢铁生产持续上升。以“试验田”对手赛开始的10月份同9月份相比，钢增长134.3％，铁增长24.2％，钢材增长55.2％；11月份钢材又比10月份增长了41.6％，铁增长了21.1％，而且质量都有很大提高。
    成都钢铁厂领导干部通过“试验田”竞赛，进一步改进了工作作风。现在全厂车间以上的党政领导干部，都分别在炼钢、炼铁、轧钢、炼焦四个车间种“试验田”。他们采取干部、工人和技术人员三结合的形式，跟群众同吃同住同劳动，并且通过自己的亲身实践，掌握生产规律，取得经验，及时指导全厂生产。
    为了突破转炉炉龄短的生产关键，厂党委书记和生产副厂长到炼钢车间，同车间主任、党总支书记分别把守四个工段，每人搞一个试验炉，订出具体指标，互相展开竞赛，及时评比，总结交流经验。他们不仅主持各种生产会议发动工人讨论计划，研究具体措施，还要亲自操作，同工人一道闯关破关，做到了炉炉检查风眼、炉炉总结经验。这样，从领导到群众，从干部到工人，都卷入了竞赛，使全车间风眼吹损由原来一百多毫米下降到二十多毫米，转炉炉龄不仅比原来提高50％以上，而且大大减少了设备事故和生产间隙时间。
