Title: CPC Central Committee Sends Congratulatory Message to 17th National Convention of CPUSA: The New Force of America Will Surely Achieve Final Victory. The American Reactionary Forces Who Persist in Their Policy of Aggression Are Ostensibly Strong But Inwardly Weak; The More They Insist on Being Hostile to the People of the World, The More They Are Resisted and Surrounded, and The More They are Isolated.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The Communist Party of the United States of America will hold its 17th National Congress in New York from the 10th to the 13th of December. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a congratulatory telegram on the 8th. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:
    Dear Comrades:
    The Central Committee of The Communist Party of China on behalf of all the members of the Communist Party of China and all the Chinese people, extends warm brotherly congratulations to the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of the United States of America.
    The 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of the United States of America is being held on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of the United States of America. The 40-year history of the Communist Party of the United States of America fully proves that it is the glorious and fighting vanguard of the American working class and the most loyal and steadfast representative and defender of the interests of the American people. For the past 40 years, the Communist Party of the United States of America has consistently and unswervingly fought to safeguard the immediate interests and democratic rights of the American working people, to strive for racial equality and realize socialism, to oppose the predatory policies and expansion plans of U.S. imperialism, and to defend world peace and strive for the cause of human progress, and has made significant contributions.
    The Communist Party of the United States of America is struggling under extremely difficult conditions. For a long time, the American ruling class has adopted various means and passed various reactionary legislations to severely persecute the Communist Party of the United States of America. This fact most clearly proves that the so-called "democracy" in the United States is nothing more than a "democracy" that represents the interests of a small group of exploiters and attacks the interests of the vast majority of working people. The fact that U.S. imperialism persecutes Marxist-Leninist parties in this way only proves that it fears the advanced forces among the American people, fears the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the long-standing American labor movement, and fears that the American working people will rise up to take control of the destiny of the country. The Communist Party of the United States of America, as the vanguard of the American working class, has demonstrated the revolutionary tenacity of the revolutionary proletariat in the face-to-face struggle against U.S. imperialism, in the struggle against bourgeois reformism within the American labor movement, and in the struggle against modern revisionism within its own ranks. Now, the Communist Party of the United States of America, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, is enhancing its combat effectiveness, strengthening its ties with the masses, consolidating the unity of its ranks, and making progress in all aspects of its work and struggle.
    Opposing war and defending peace are the most important common tasks of the people of all countries in the world today. Recently, some easing of the world situation has begun to appear, but the reactionary forces in the United States who persist in the policy of aggression and war are still unwilling to accept the peace propositions of the American people and the people of the world in practical actions, and therefore they are the common enemy of the people of the world, including the American people. This enemy only appears to be strong, but in reality, it is ostensibly strong but inwardly weak. It continues to run rampant around the world, continues to carry out aggression and expansion activities, and continues to engage in activities to prepare for new wars and maintain a tense situation. But the more it insists on being hostile to the people of the world, the more it is resisted and surrounded by the people of the world, and the more it is isolated. The struggle of your party and your people is by no means isolated. Your allies are all over the world, and your future is very bright.
    In the United States, the situation in which the new forces are at a disadvantage and the decadent forces are at an advantage is only a temporary phenomenon, and it will definitely change in the opposite direction. As time passes, under the education of Marxist-Leninists and the influence of the socialist movement, the American people will increasingly understand that uniting to wage a joint struggle against the monopoly capital groups, defending democracy, defending peace, striving for social progress and friendly coexistence between peoples of all countries, is in the fundamental interests of the American people. The future belongs to the American people.
    We wish the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of the United States of America complete success! We wish the Communist Party of the United States of America, under the leadership of the National Committee, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, will achieve new successes in the efforts to enhance the unity of the party and the unity of the working class, and in the struggle for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism of the American people!
                            The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                                      December 8, 1959

    中共中央电贺美共第十七次代表大会
    美国新生力量必获最后胜利
    坚持侵略政策的美国反动势力外强中干，它愈是坚持与世界人民为敌，就愈是受到抵抗和包围，愈是处于孤立的地位。
    新华社10日讯　美国共产党10日到13日在纽约举行第十七次全国代表大会。中国共产党中央委员会8日去电祝贺。贺电全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表全体中国共产党党员和全体中国人民，向美国共产党第十七次全国代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    美国共产党第十七次全国代表大会举行于美国共产党成立的第四十周年。美国共产党四十年的历史，充分地证明它是美国工人阶级光荣的、战斗的先锋队，是美国人民利益的最忠实最坚贞的代表者和捍卫者。四十年来，美国共产党始终不渝地为维护美国劳动人民的切身利益和民主权利，为争取种族平等和实现社会主义，为反对美帝国主义的掠夺政策和扩张计划，为保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的事业，进行了英勇的斗争，并且作出了重大的贡献。
    美国共产党是在极端困难的条件下进行斗争的。长时期以来，美国统治阶级采取了各种手段，通过各种反动立法，对美国共产党进行了和进行着严重的迫害。这个事实最清楚地证明，所谓美国的“民主”不过是代表一小撮剥削者利益向绝大多数劳动人民利益进攻的“民主”。美帝国主义如此迫害马克思列宁主义政党，只是证明，它害怕美国人民中的先进力量，害怕马克思列宁主义同有长久历史的美国工人运动相结合，害怕美国劳动人民起来掌握国家的命运。而美国共产党，作为美国工人阶级先锋队，在同美帝国主义进行面对面的斗争中，在美国工人运动内部进行抵抗资产阶级改良主义的斗争中，以及在自己队伍内部进行反对现代修正主义的斗争中，都表现了革命无产阶级的革命顽强性。现在，高举马克思列宁主义旗帜的美国共产党正在提高着自己的战斗力，加强着自己同群众的联系，巩固着自己队伍的团结，在自己的工作和斗争的各方面都取得了进展。
    反对战争，保卫和平是世界各国人民当前最重要的共同任务。最近世界局势开始出现了某些缓和，但是美国的坚持侵略政策和战争政策的反动势力，仍然不愿意在实际行动中接受美国人民和世界人民的和平主张，因而它是包括美国人民在内的世界人民的共同敌人。这个敌人只是外表看来强大，而实际上却是外强中干的。它继续在全世界横行霸道，继续进行侵略和扩张活动，继续进行准备新战争和保持紧张局势的活动。但是它愈是坚持与世界人民为敌，就愈是受到世界人民的抵抗和包围，愈是处于孤立的地位。你们的党和你们人民的斗争决不是孤立的，你们的同盟者满天下，你们的前途是非常光明的。
    在美国，新生力量居于劣势，而腐朽力量居于优势的形势，完全是暂时的现象，它一定会向相反的方向起变化。积以时日，美国人民在马克思列宁主义者的教育和社会主义运动的影响下，必将日益了解，团结起来进行反对垄断资本集团的联合斗争，保卫民主，保卫和平，争取社会进步和各国人民之间友好相处，这是美国人民的根本利益的所在。未来是属于美国人民的。
    祝美国共产党第十七次全国代表大会圆满成功！祝美国共产党在全国委员会的领导下，高举着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，在增强党的团结和工人阶级团结的努力中，在争取美国人民的和平、民主和社会主义事业的斗争中，获得新的成就！
                            中国共产党中央委员会
                                      一九五九年十二月八日
