According to a report from the New Hunan Daily, the workers of the Qiyang Coal Mine in Hunan Province vigorously carried out technical innovation and, after several months of effort, achieved "one-stop" indigenous mechanization from coal mining to coke production. The mine completed its annual production tasks for raw coal and coke 66 and 46 days ahead of schedule, respectively.

This coal mine was established during the Great Leap Forward last year. In the first few months, the production technology was very backward. The mine's 733 production workers produced only 63 tons of coal and 8 to 9 tons of coke per day, and the quality was very low. In order to quickly change this backward state, under the specific leadership of the Qiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they launched a mass movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution in a planned and systematic way, starting in April this year, based on the spirit of "taking indigenous methods as the mainstay, from indigenous to foreign, combining indigenous and foreign methods." First, they carried out "four reforms" targeting the main keys in production, namely, changing small roadways to large roadways, curved roadways to straight roadways, steep slopes to inclined slopes, changing artificial ventilation to natural ventilation, changing the Kongming cart to indigenous high-pressure water pumps, and changing manual coal hauling to rope-traction indigenous winches. By July, on the basis of the "four reforms," they had achieved "sixizations," namely, upgrading indigenous winches, mechanizing coal crushing, implementing chute washing, automating coal selection with sieves, streamlining kiln loading, and using carts for ground transportation, which increased the daily output of bituminous coal from 63 tons to 90 tons. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution reached a new peak, with more than 80% of the workers participating in the movement, creating 16 kinds of equipment and tools such as indigenous and foreign winches and coal crushers. Now, seven of the sixteen processes in this coal mine have been fully mechanized and automated, and the remaining nine processes have also been semi-mechanized, forming a "one-stop" indigenous mechanized production line. From then on, the miners throughout the mine were liberated from heavy physical labor, and production efficiency was unprecedentedly improved. For example, in hoisting, the well is 120 meters deep. In the past, it took 40 minutes to haul coal once by shoulder, and each person hauled 66 kilograms each time, and could only haul 0.6 tons a day. After using an indigenous and foreign winch, the average person hauls 12 tons a day, greatly improving work efficiency. Originally, coal crushing was done by hand hammering, and each person could only crush more than one ton a day. Now, with a coal crusher, the average person crushes 40 tons, increasing work efficiency by 39 times. For ground transportation of 300 meters, originally, each person carried only three tons a day, and 30 people engaged in transportation, but still less than 100 tons per day. Now, using pulleys has increased work efficiency by more than ten times. In the past, 80 people used buckets and baskets to wash less than 80 tons of coal every day; now, using a two-stage automatic flow-through coal washing trough, 12 people can operate and wash 400 tons of coal every day, increasing work efficiency by 32 times. In the past, it took 12 people eight hours to load a kiln for coking. Now, using an automatic sky bridge to load the kiln only requires three people. In the past, ten people were needed to drain water with a Kongming cart, but now only two people are needed with an indigenous high-pressure water pump. In the past, it took 30 people half an hour to load a cart, now it only takes one person one minute. The production of coal and coke has also seen a rapid leap forward, achieving high quality, high yield, low consumption, safety, and all-round success. In November, the daily output of coal and coke increased to 350 tons and 50 tons respectively; the ash content of coal gradually decreased from 30% to below 10%, and the sulfur content decreased from 5% to below 2%; the ash content of coke decreased from 20% to 8%, and the sulfur content decreased from 3.5% to 1.5%, and the recovery rate also increased from 45% to over 75%. The cost of each ton of bituminous coal has dropped from 27 yuan to 4 yuan, and the cost of each ton of coke has dropped from 94 yuan to 30 yuan. At present, 200 workers have been transferred from the production process to the new well construction aspect. (Attached picture)

Xinhua News Agency, Reporter Zhang Ruihua: Workers of the Yuxian Coal Mine have begun to use electric drills to drill holes, winches to hoist coal, and electric chutes to transport coal. Wang Yindou (left), an old miner with 40 years of experience, and Zhou Bingcheng, a young miner, were very happy to use electric drills to excavate coal seams for the first time.

　　祁阳小煤窑高举技术改造红旗
    全部生产过程使用机械
    人员减少四分之一，日产量增加四倍，吨煤成本由二十七元降到四元
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省祁阳煤矿职工大闹技术革新，经过几个月的努力，实现了从采煤到出焦的“一条龙”土机械化。这个矿提前六十六天和四十六天完成了全年原煤和焦炭的生产任务。
    这个煤矿是去年大跃进当中办起来的。开头几个月，生产技术很落后，全矿七百三十三个生产工人，一天只出六十三吨煤，八至九吨焦，质量很低。为了迅速改变这种落后状态，他们在中共祁阳县委的具体领导下，从今年4月起，根据“以土为主，由土到洋，土洋结合”的精神，有计划地系统地开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动。首先，针对生产上的主要关键进行了“四改”，即小巷改大巷、弯巷改直巷、陡坡改斜坡，改人工通风为自然通风，改孔明车为土高压水泵，改人工拖煤为绳索牵引土绞车。到7月间，又在“四改”的基础上实现了“六化”，即提升土绞车化、碎煤机械化、洗煤溜槽化、选煤自动筛子化、装窑流水化、地面运输车子化，使烟煤日产量由六十三吨提高到了九十吨。党的八届八中全会后，技术革新和技术革命的群众运动又达到了一个新的高峰，80％以上的职工投入了运动，创造了土洋结合绞车、碎煤机等十六种设备和工具。现在，这个煤矿十六道工序有七道工序全部实现了机械化、自动化，其余九道工序也实现了半机械化，形成了“一条龙”的土机械化生产。从此，全矿工人从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，生产效率空前提高。比如提升，井深一百二十米，过去肩拖一次煤要四十分钟，每人每次拖六十六公斤，一天只能拖零点六吨；改用土洋结合绞车后，平均每人每天十二吨，大大提高了工效。碎煤原来用手捶，每人每天只碎得一吨多；现在用碎煤机，平均每人四十吨，提高工效三十九倍；地面运输三百米，原来肩挑每人每天只运三吨，三十个人搞运输，每天还不到一百吨。现在改用滑车，提高工效十倍多。洗煤过去八十人用扮桶捞箕每天洗不到八十吨；现在改用双级自动流水洗煤槽，十二人操作，每天能洗煤四百吨，提高工效三十二倍。炼焦装窑，八小时装一窑过去要十二人，现在改用自动天桥装窑，三个人就够了；排水过去用孔明车需要十个人，采用土高压水泵只要两个人；装车过去三十个人装一车，要半点钟，现在只要一个人一分钟。煤焦生产也出现了突飞猛进的局面，实现了优质高产低耗安全满堂红。11月份煤、焦日产量分别上升为三百五十吨和五十吨；煤的灰分由30％逐步下降到10％以下，硫分由5％下降到2％以下；焦炭灰分由20％下降到8％，硫分由3.5％降到1.5％，回收率也由45％上升到75％以上。成本每吨烟煤由二十七元降到四元，每吨焦炭由九十四元降到三十元。目前，从生产工序抽出转到新井基建方面去的工人达二百人。（附图片）
