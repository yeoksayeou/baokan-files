Having achieved success, Zhong County in Sichuan Province, a well-known high-yield rapeseed county, is making persistent efforts and strengthening field management on the basis of planting more and better rapeseed.

Zhong County has sown 50,000 mu of rapeseed, an increase of 66.6% over the actual harvested area this year. At the same time, the people of the county have used scattered land to plant 196.03 million rapeseed plants. All 50,000 mu of rapeseed use the Victory improved variety, with deep plowing generally above eight inches, and the command field above one foot five inches; eight-foot rows are opened, with a trench depth of one foot five inches to two feet, and a width of one foot to one foot five inches, opening rows east-west and setting rows north-south, realizing garden-style management; the base fertilizer applied per mu is 4,000 to 5,000 jin of refined fertilizer and about 10,000 jin of coarse fertilizer; the planting density is doubled compared to last year (4,000 to 7,000 plants). Rapeseed planting has implemented the advanced method of "small concentration, large contiguous area, one-dragon, full red," the benefits of which are: convenient leadership and management, saving labor for input into other production, and enabling the banner of high yield to bloom everywhere. At the same time, various places have also launched a movement to strive to achieve "one garden, three factories," and "one pond per mu," that is, each rapeseed garden has a local chemical fertilizer factory, a local pesticide factory, a local agricultural tool reform factory, and each mu of rapeseed area has a local manure pond. Due to the implementation of the above measures, the seedlings are currently growing well. According to the recent large-scale inspection and appraisal of "teams go, fields reach, plots check, plants see," the first-class seedlings (seedling height above two feet, 10 to 15 branches) account for 50%, the second-class seedlings (seedling height above one foot five inches, starting to branch) account for 40%, and the third-class seedlings (seedling height eight inches to one foot) account for about 10%. This year's third-class seedlings are actually equivalent to last year's second-class seedlings.

From deep plowing and sowing, the county launched a chain competition and opponent competition between districts, communes, teams, groups, gardens, and people. More than 6,000 red flags fluttered in the wind, and everywhere was a surging tide of leaping forward, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced. For example, after Shihuanggongshe and Fengshougongshe launched an opponent competition, Shihuanggongshe saw that Fengshougongshe had deeply plowed eight or nine inches, while their commune had only deeply plowed five or six inches. The entire commune immediately organized more than 5,000 members to re-plow. After several days of concentrated effort, more than 1,200 mu of rapeseed area were all deeply plowed to more than one foot two inches, exceeding Fengshougongshe. In order to grasp every key link of rapeseed production, the county party committee launched a five-check and five-supplement movement centering on the whole nest of seedlings in the rapeseed seedling stage; in the mid-term field management, it launched a "ten-no" movement centering on seedling emergence and growth; and in the bolting stage, it launched a blitz movement to eliminate third-class seedlings centering on heavy application of bolting fertilizer.

(1) Zhong County not only achieved deep plowing and soil improvement, meticulous land preparation, and deep ditch drainage, but also carried out land disinfection to eliminate the spread of rapeseed virus. Now, the 50,000 mu of rapeseed fields in the county have basically achieved no water accumulation. The one-hundred-mu rapeseed garden in Bashangongshe adopted the drainage method of clearing ditches before rain, draining floods during rain, and draining water after rain, achieving dry ditches after rain, neat plots, strong plants, and about 40% fewer diseases than neighboring rapeseed gardens.

(2) Apply base fertilizer deeply throughout the layer, and topdressing frequently, skillfully, and heavily during bolting, budding, and flowering. In order to meet the fertilizer needs of rapeseed, various communes launched a mass fertilizer accumulation and production movement, basically meeting the fertilizer required by rapeseed. In addition to applying sufficient base fertilizer, topdressing requires about 20,000 jin per mu. The fertilizer preparation is mainly natural fertilizer, supplemented by chemical fertilizer. Base fertilizer should use nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium elements together; during topdressing, nitrogen fertilizer should be the main component during the seedling stage, supplemented with phosphorus and potassium fertilizer; during bolting and budding, nitrogen and potassium fertilizer should be the main component, supplemented with phosphorus fertilizer; during flowering and podding, phosphorus and potassium fertilizer should be the main component, supplemented with nitrogen fertilizer. The method of fertilization is: mix base fertilizer with soil to ripen the soil, concentrate refined fertilizer in nests, and topdressing should grasp "two guarantees and five attacks." "Two guarantees" are frequent application of nitrogen fertilizer during the seedling stage to resist drought and protect seedlings; increasing the application of heat-generating fertilizer in cold weather to keep warm. When the winter temperature is low and rapeseed grows slowly, using compost, dried cattle manure powder, wood ash, lime, and oil cake mixed to nourish the roots can increase soil temperature, speed up rapeseed growth, and have a disinfecting and sterilizing effect. The "five attacks" are attacking seedlings, attacking bolting, attacking budding, attacking flowering, and attacking pod formation. Bolting fertilizer is particularly important, which can make stems thick and roots developed, achieve short and numerous branches, high upper forest rate, and can provide a certain foundation for the fertilizer needs of the budding and flowering stages, making the pods large and dense, and the pods full.

(3) Combine local and foreign methods, prevent more than cure, and completely eliminate diseases and insect pests. According to inspections in various places, the diseases that have appeared in rapeseed include sclerotinia root rot, virus disease, black spot disease, white spot disease, etc. The county is making every effort to adopt various methods of combining local and foreign methods to comprehensively prevent and control. For example, mixing 10%-20% lime with 80%-90% wood ash and sprinkling it on the stems, leaves, and ground, or using one jin of Ceresan mixed with ninety-nine jin of wood ash for application, or using lime sulfur mixture, wild cotton flower liquid, horse mulberry leaf liquid, yellow Vitex leaf liquid, etc. for irrigation, all have good results.

(4) Select fine varieties, sow in a timely manner, plant reasonably densely, and transplant strong seedlings. All 50,000 mu of rapeseed in the county use Victory rapeseed fine varieties. At the same time, wind selection, screening, multiple water washing of seeds, salt water disinfection, and field weeding of miscellaneous seedlings and retaining pure seedlings were carried out to maintain the purity of the seedlings. According to the characteristics of Victory rapeseed and the experience of 1959, and according to the principle of "early sparse, late dense" for sowing time and "fertile sparse, lean dense" for soil quality, different dense planting specifications were promoted.

(5) Resolutely eliminate third-class seedlings in the seedling stage and not let them overwinter. The measures are: First, organize assault teams, divide areas for contract, implement measures to the fields, assign responsibilities to individuals, manage to the plants, and improve regularly. The county organized a total of 559 assault teams to transform third-class seedlings, and after a ten-day battle, reduced 20% of the third-class seedlings to 10%. Second, thin seedlings and fix seedlings early. The county thinned seedlings, fixed seedlings, supplemented strong seedlings, and replaced weak seedlings three times, ensuring the whole nest of seedlings, seedling emergence, and strong seedlings. Third, look at the seedlings to topdress and spot fertilize to promote seedlings. Various places have ranked in different levels and taken different measures according to different situations. For those that lack fertilizer and grow poorly, apply quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer to promote seedlings; for weak seedlings, use spot topdressing to promote seedlings; for those with poor drainage, deepen the ditches for drainage. Fourth, cultivate diligently, weed diligently, cultivate early, cultivate more, first deep and then shallow. Cultivation can not only eliminate weeds, but also loosen soil, ventilate, regulate climate, prevent and control diseases and insect pests, promote fertilizer decomposition, and accelerate rapeseed growth.

(6) Ensure that pods are full. The measures are: establish apiaries in the fields and artificially assist pollination to enhance pollination ability and ensure that pods are full; during the budding and flowering stages, apply large amounts of fertilizer and water, apply frequently and irrigate fully to ensure that rapeseed has sufficient fertilizer for flowering and podding, especially heavy application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer; thoroughly prevent and control diseases and insect pests; spray boric acid.

(7) Conduct large-scale scientific experiments to explore high-yield pathways. The people of the county not only vigorously launch a mass high-yield movement, but also conduct in-depth, meticulous, and serious scientific research. This year, all seven districts and most of the communes in the county have carried out relatively detailed scientific research work. The experimental projects are all key to rapeseed yield increase, such as early or late sowing, planting density, fertilization method, deep plowing, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, sowing methods, and more than ten other comparative experiments.

　　乘胜前进，再夺油菜高产县
    忠县大搞群众运动五万亩油菜田间管理扎实细致
    本报讯　著名油菜高产县——四川忠县广大群众在油菜种的多种的好的基础上，再接再厉，加强田间管理。
    忠县已播油菜五万亩，比今年实收面积增加66.6％。同时全县人民利用零星土地，种植油菜王一亿九千六百零三万株。五万亩油菜，全部采用胜利良种，深耕一般在八寸以上，指挥田一尺五寸以上；八尺开厢，沟深在一尺五寸到二尺以上，宽一尺到一尺五寸，东西开厢、南北定行，实现了园田化；底肥每亩施精肥四千至五千斤，粗肥万斤左右；密植程度比去年提高一倍（四千至七千株）。油菜种植贯彻了“小集中、大连片、一条龙、满堂红”的先进办法，这样作的好处是：便利领导和管理，能节约劳力投入其他生产，能使高产旗帜遍地开花。与此同时，各地还开展了力争实现“一园三厂”、“每亩一凼”的运动，即每个油菜园有土制化肥厂、土制农药厂、土农具改革厂和每亩油菜面积有一土粪凼。由于贯彻了以上措施，目前苗稼生长良好，从最近开展的“队队走、田田到、块块查、株株看”的大检查、大评比情况看，一类苗（苗高二尺以上，分枝十至十五个）占50％，二类苗（苗高一尺五寸以上，开始分枝）占40％，三类苗（苗高八寸到一尺以上）占10％左右，今年的三类苗实际上相等于去年的二类苗。
    从深耕播种开始，全县就开展了区与区、社与社、队与队、组与组、园与园、人与人的连环竞赛和对手竞赛，六千多面红旗迎风招展，到处是你追我赶，学先进、赶先进、超先进的跃进热潮。例如石黄公社与丰收公社开展对手竞赛后，石黄公社看到丰收公社已深翻八、九寸，而本社才深耕五、六寸，全社立即组织了五千多个社员进行复翻，经过几天突击，一千二百多亩油菜面积，全部深翻在一尺二寸以上，超过了丰收公社。为了抓好油菜生产的各个关键，县委在油菜幼苗期以全窝全苗为中心，开展了五查五补运动；中期田间管理中，又开展了以苗齐苗壮为中心的“十无”运动；开盘期又以重施开盘肥为中心，开展了消灭三类苗的突击运动。
    （1）忠县不仅做到了深耕炕土，精细整地，深沟排水，同时，为了消除油菜病毒的传染，还进行了土地消毒。现在全县五万亩油菜田，基本实现了田无积水。拔山公社一百亩油菜园采取了雨前清沟、雨中排洪、雨后排渍的排水方法，做到雨住沟干、块块整齐、株株健壮，病害比相邻的油菜园少40％左右。
    （2）底肥全层深施，追肥勤施、巧施，开盘、抽苔、现蕾重施。为了满足油菜用肥，各公社开展了群众性的积肥造肥运动，基本上满足了油菜所需肥料，除施足底肥外，追肥要求亩施二万斤左右。肥料的配制，以自然肥为主，化肥为辅。底肥氮、磷、钾三要素齐用；追肥时，苗期以氮肥为主，配施磷钾肥；开盘、现蕾以氮肥钾肥为主，配施磷肥；花、荚以磷、钾肥为主，配施氮肥。施肥的方法是：底肥与土混合熟化土壤，精肥集中窝施，追肥掌握“两保、五攻”。“两保”是苗期氮肥勤施，抗旱保苗；天冷增施酿热肥保温，冬季气温低，油菜生长缓慢，用堆肥、干牛粪粉、草木灰、石灰、油饼混合壅蔸，可以提高土温，加快油菜生长，同时有消毒杀菌的作用。“五攻”是攻苗、攻开盘、攻现蕾、攻花期、攻结荚。开盘肥尤为重要，能使茎秆粗壮、根部发达，达到分枝矮而多，上林率高，而且可以为蕾期、花期需肥提供一定的基础，使荚大角密，结荚累累。
    （3）土洋结合、防重于治、全面消灭病虫害。目前据各地检查，油菜出现的病害有菌核根腐病、毒素病、黑斑病、白斑病等，全县正千方百计，采取多种多样的土洋结合办法，全面防治。如用10％—20％的石灰，80％—90％草木灰混合，撒在茎叶上和地面上，或用赛力散一斤、草木灰九十九斤混合撒施防治，或用石硫合剂、野棉花液、马桑叶液、黄荆叶液等浇灌，收效都很好。
    （4）精选良种，适时播种，合理密植，壮苗移栽。全县五万亩油菜，全部选用胜利油菜良种，同时进行了风选、筛选、清水多次淘种，盐水消毒，和进行田间去杂苗、留纯苗，保持了苗的纯度。根据胜利油菜的特点和1959年经验，根据播种期“早稀、迟密”和根据土质“肥稀、瘦密”的原则，推行了不同的密植规格。
    （5）坚决把三类苗消灭在幼苗期，不让三类苗过冬。措施是：第一，组织突击小组，分片包干，措施到田，责任到人，管理到株，定期提高。全县共组织五百五十九个改造三类苗的突击队，大战十天，将20％的三类苗降低到10％。第二，早匀苗、定苗。全县三次匀苗、定苗、补壮苗、换弱苗，保证了全窝全苗，苗齐苗壮。第三，看苗追肥，点窝提苗。各地都分级排队，针对不同情况，采取了不同的措施，对缺肥生长不良的，施速效性的氮肥催苗；对弱苗，就用点窝追肥的办法提苗；对排水不良的，就深沟排水。第四，勤中耕，勤除草，早中耕，多中耕，先深后浅。中耕不仅能消灭杂草，还有松土、通风、调节气候、防治病虫害等作用，促使肥料分解，加快油菜生长。
    （6）保荚满尖。措施是：田间建立养蜂场和人工辅助授粉，增强授粉能力，保证荚荚满粒，枝枝满尖；蕾期、花期，大肥大水，勤施饱灌，保证油菜开花结荚有足够的肥料，特别要重施磷钾肥；彻底防治病虫害；喷施硼酸。
    （7）大搞科学试验，探讨高产途径。全县人民不仅轰轰烈烈大搞群众高产运动，而且还深入地、细致地、认真地进行科学研究。今年全县七个区和大多数的公社都开展了比较细致的科学研究工作，试验的项目都是油菜的增产关键，如播种早迟、密植程度、施肥方法、深耕、防治病虫害、播种方式等十多项对比试验。（附图片）
