Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 17th: The Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 3 giant open hearth furnace has been officially completed and produced its first batch of steel on the 15th.

    The No. 3 open hearth furnace was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production in April next year. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, the builders, after opposing rightist tendencies and boosting their morale, repeatedly applied to the Wuhan Iron and Steel General Party Committee, requesting to complete the furnace and tap steel within the year. Although the workload of the No. 3 open hearth furnace was equivalent to that of the No. 2 open hearth furnace, the construction period for various projects, such as the installation of the furnace body's metal components, the installation of mechanical and electrical equipment, and the bricklaying of the slag chamber and regenerator, were all advanced compared to the No. 2 open hearth furnace. The entire project's construction period only took twenty-one days, nine days shorter than the No. 2 open hearth furnace, setting another new record for rapid construction.

    In the process of constructing the No. 3 open hearth furnace, the workers boldly innovated technology, proposing 512 innovation suggestions. Many processes have been changed from manual to mechanical construction. In the past, although bricklaying used conveyor belts to transport bricks, manual labor was still needed to pass the bricks one by one to the bricklayers. Now, the workers have changed to using small conveyor belts to directly send the refractory bricks to the bricklayers, saving a lot of labor. The bricklayers also widely promoted the double-handed mortar squeezing method and launched competitions, increasing efficiency exponentially. The labor force for bricklaying the furnace body of the No. 3 open hearth furnace was reduced by 34% compared to the No. 2 open hearth furnace, while the construction period was shortened by three days. Inspections have proved that the engineering quality of the No. 3 open hearth furnace is good, and the installation precision of the components exceeds the design requirements.

    Xinhua News Agency: Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company has comprehensively completed this year's basic construction plan ahead of schedule.

    As of November 26, this company had completed 101% of this year's state investment plan; the labor productivity plan was completed by 105%; and the cost from January to November was reduced by 16.71% compared to the plan. At the same time, major quality accidents were eliminated, and the quality of key projects reached excellent standards after acceptance.

    Since the beginning of this year, in addition to completing the three major projects of No. 3 blast furnace, No. 3 coke oven, and sintering plant, the company has also completed five larger construction projects that guarantee high production of pig iron, such as the ore beneficiation workshop and slag pond. The completion and commissioning of these new projects have created favorable conditions for the company to comprehensively overfulfill this year's production tasks of pig iron, coke, and other products. Since being put into production on May 23, the iron produced by the No. 3 blast furnace has accounted for 22.13% of the company's annual iron production plan by the end of November. The coke produced by the No. 3 coke oven from May to the end of November has also accounted for 25.15% of the company's annual coke production plan. The ore beneficiation workshop, built in just twelve days and put into production, can select about 2,000 tons of ore per day. The iron content of the ore after beneficiation is 8% higher than before.

    This year, all construction units under the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have launched a mass movement, continued to implement the policy of concentrating superior forces to attack key projects in construction, and ensured the successful completion of key projects. In addition, the experience of investment contracting was continued in construction, and the basic construction staff conscientiously implemented cost reduction measures, saving a large amount of funds for the country.

    武钢三号平炉出钢
    二十一天建成——巨型平炉快速施工又创新纪录
    石景山钢铁公司全面完成今年基本建设任务
    新华社武汉17日电　武钢三号巨型平炉正式建成，15日炼出了第一炉钢。
    三号平炉原拟在明年4月建成投入生产，建设者们在党的总路线光辉照耀下，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，一再向武钢总党委申请，要求在年内建成出钢。三号平炉的工程量虽然和二号平炉相等，但炉体金属构件安装，机械、电机设备安装，沉渣室和蓄热室砌砖等各项工程的工期，都比二号平炉提前，全部工程的建设工期只用了二十一天，比二号平炉工期缩短九天，又一次创造了快速施工新纪录。
    在建设三号平炉的过程中，工人们大胆地革新技术，先后提出五百一十二项革新建议，许多工序已由人工改用机械施工。过去筑炉用砖虽有皮带机运送，但仍需人工把砖一块块传到筑炉工手边。现在，工人们改用小型皮带机把耐火砖直接送到筑炉工人手边，节约了大量劳动力。筑炉工人们还广泛地推行了双手挤浆法，开展了对手赛，功效成倍提高。三号平炉炉体砌砖的劳动力，比二号平炉减少34％，而工期却缩短了三天。检验证明，三号平炉的工程质量良好，安装的构件精密度都超过了设计要求。
    新华社讯　石景山钢铁公司已提前全面完成今年的基本建设计划。
    到11月26日，这个公司今年的国家投资计划完成了101％；劳动生产率计划完成105％；1月到11月的成本比计划降低16.71％。同时消灭了重大的质量事故，重点工程经过验收，质量达到优等。
    今年以来，这个公司除了建成三号高炉、三号焦炉和烧结厂三大工程以外，还完成了水选矿石车间、水渣池等五项保证生铁高产的较大建设项目。这些新工程建成投入生产，为全公司全面超额完成今年的生铁、焦炭等生产任务创造了有利条件。三号高炉自5月23日投入生产到11月底，所产生铁已占公司全年产铁计划的22.13％。三号焦炉从5月份投入生产到11月底生产的焦炭，也已占公司全年焦炭生产计划的25.15％。仅用十二天建成的水选矿石车间投入生产以来，每天可选矿石两千吨左右，经过水选后的矿石含铁量比原来提高了8％。
    今年，石景山钢铁公司所属各施工单位大搞群众运动，在施工中继续贯彻执行了集中优势兵力突击重点工程的方针，保证了重点工程的胜利建成。另外，在施工中继续推行投资包干的经验，基本建设的职工认真执行了降低成本的措施，为国家节约了大量资金。
