Continuing to Advance on the Basis of Victory
Lin Xiude, Standing Committee Member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　Teaching is the main task of a school. Under the premise of implementing the Party's education policy, improving the quality of teaching is a strategic task. After several years of practice, the leading cadres of middle schools at all levels in Fujian Province have ideologically resolved this problem. Especially after the Central Education Work Conference in January and February of this year, everyone has a clearer understanding of the importance of teaching work.

　　To do a good job in teaching, the school's Party organization must be determined to strengthen its leadership over teaching work, overcome fear of difficulties, and abandon the idea of simply relying on "experts" and taking the expert route. Simply relying on "experts" and taking the expert route in teaching is bound to lead to a path of detachment from politics, detachment from production, and detachment from reality; moreover, simply relying on "experts" cannot fully mobilize the enthusiasm of teachers and students, overcome difficulties in the course of advancement, and rapidly improve the quality of teaching. In recent years, everyone has gradually clarified that leading teaching is a matter of further consolidating the Party's leadership in schools, so the determination to lead teaching has become even greater. Everything fears earnestness; as long as you take it seriously, you can get things done well. Based on this experience, we mobilized the leading cadres of middle schools in Fujian Province to strengthen their leadership over teaching work. In leading teaching, there is another ideological obstacle, which is the belief that Fujian Province's teachers and facilities are poor, lacking the confidence to catch up with the level of advanced provinces and cities, and being content to remain in the middle. We fully estimated the favorable conditions for improving the quality of teaching in Fujian Province, such as the Party committee attaching great importance to school work, the great achievements in political and ideological work in schools in recent years, the relatively rapid improvement of the political awareness of teachers and students, the serious attitude of teachers and students towards teaching and learning, the accumulation of some experience by some schools in the province in leading teaching and improving teaching quality, and the promotion and influence of the high tide of industrial and agricultural production throughout the province. These all show that although we are in relatively difficult conditions, as long as we strengthen subjective effort, we can catch up with the level of advanced provinces and cities in terms of teaching quality. In several major production upsurges, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also took the issue of improving teaching quality as a slogan to mobilize teachers and students in various schools, and assigned Party committees at all levels to grasp it, which further boosted the revolutionary drive of all middle school teachers and students and ensured that middle school teaching work could be comprehensively improved in the correct direction.

　　We mobilize all middle school teachers and students to work hard to improve the quality of teaching, but we will never allow them to take the old road of the bourgeoisie and guide teaching work in a direction that is divorced from politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality. We can only improve in the direction of the proletariat, not in the direction of the bourgeoisie; we can only use proletarian educational thought to guide, and we cannot allow any bourgeois educational thought to guide. Therefore, strengthening ideological leadership in teaching work is the primary link. Some schools, in emphasizing the improvement of teaching quality, are unwilling to engage in political movements and productive labor, fearing that political movements and productive labor will reduce teaching quality. We resolutely fought against this idea. Practice has proven that some schools with relatively rapid improvement in teaching quality are precisely those where the Party's leadership is relatively strong and the combination of teaching and productive labor, politics and business, is relatively good. Some schools with originally better foundations, because they oppose politics and business, labor and teaching, and hesitate and waver when encountering movements, cannot thoroughly implement the Party's policies and cannot fully mobilize the enthusiasm of teachers and students, and instead cannot improve the quality of teaching. Of course, in the process of major educational revolution movements, it is very important to establish a proletarian teaching order in a timely manner. After middle schools in Fujian Province participated in the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production, they immediately, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, comprehensively arranged and organized school work with teaching as the center. Under the slogan of "Striving for a Triple Harvest of Politics, Teaching, and Labor," all schools grasped teaching, strengthened political and ideological education, and rationally arranged productive labor.

　　In leading teaching work, leading cadres must go deep into reality, grasp the specific situation of teaching work, proceed from reality, and solve problems. Among school leading cadres, there are two common situations: one is that they do not have enough contact with reality and only generally put forward slogans and requirements and generally conduct leadership; the other is that although they can go deep into a class or a group, they often cannot see the overall situation or only conduct leadership in a purely professional or piecemeal manner. We believe that school leading cadres must not only go deep into reality to understand the teaching and learning situation of teachers and students, but also conscientiously study the Party's policies and the instructions of higher authorities, grasp the main problems in teaching, and solve them without losing the opportunity. For example, in the past few years, many teachers did not pay attention to the teaching syllabus, were not clear about the purpose and tasks of each subject, did not study the new textbooks thoroughly, and there were many phenomena of liberalism in teaching. The school's leading cadres promptly required teachers to conscientiously study the teaching syllabus, study the new textbooks, and help one or two teaching and research groups achieve results, promote the general, and strengthen the organization and leadership of teaching.

　　Correctly handling the relationship between teachers and students and implementing the mass line are crucial to improving the quality of teaching. To correctly handle the relationship between teachers and students, it is first necessary to implement the principle of playing the leading role of teachers under the leadership of the Party and under the principle of teaching and learning from each other. We require teachers to comprehensively care for students and strictly demand students; in particular, we require teachers to pay attention to regularly studying and grasping students' learning situations while carefully preparing lessons and strengthening classroom teaching, regularly hold teacher-student forums, listen to students' opinions on teaching, and integrate with students to overcome subjective teaching methods that are divorced from the reality of students. In many schools, at the beginning of new student enrollment, teachers conduct in-depth investigations and studies of students' knowledge foundation; during the teaching process, they also regularly check for problems in teaching and learning and solve them in a timely manner; in the middle and at the end of each year, they conduct more comprehensive investigations and studies to help students make review plans. All of this work is carried out in cooperation with students. Students are generally able to both respect teachers and promptly offer suggestions to teachers. Schools also often educate students to adopt a correct attitude towards teachers, so teachers are relatively satisfied. Secondly, it is necessary to fully stimulate students' strong desire for knowledge and cultivate students' spirit of diligent study and hard practice. In this regard, we have paid attention to playing the role of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers. In recent years, we have continuously conducted education on the purpose of learning to students through the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers, and have conducted education on how to correctly treat politics and business, learning and labor, theory and practice, and have paid attention to using methods such as praising the advanced and establishing role models to encourage students' enthusiasm for learning.

　　The training and improvement of teachers is another important aspect of improving the quality of teaching. At the beginning of liberation, there were less than 3,000 middle school teachers in Fujian Province, and now it has expanded to more than 10,000. Before 1958, there was only one normal college in the province, and the teachers trained could not meet the needs of the rapid development of education. Therefore, in recent years, the main method of expanding the source of teachers has been to train a large number of primary school teachers and high school graduates to teach in junior high schools, and to select and train a group of people from junior high school teachers to teach in high schools.

　　The training and improvement of teachers includes politics and business. Here, we will focus on discussing the methods of improving teachers' cultural level and professional ability. The main aspects in this regard are: 1. "Old leading the new," with teachers in the school who have teaching experience and a higher level helping new teachers, adopting methods such as "listening before speaking" and "learning while teaching." 2. Establishing teacher training institutions at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, and improving teachers through various teaching workshops, teaching forums, and rotational training in batches. 3. Carrying out inter-school teaching research activities, with schools with better teacher conditions leading and helping schools with poorer conditions. 4. Organizing teachers to participate in correspondence learning. Taking the above measures has played a great role in cultivating and improving teachers and ensuring the quality of teaching. Zhao'an No. 1 Middle School is a complete middle school that has developed from a junior high school to more than 1,400 people. Currently, there are 61 teachers in the school, only 6 of whom are college graduates, accounting for 10%, while 25 have a high school graduation level, accounting for 41%. There are 35 teachers in the school who have not been in school for five years, accounting for 57.4%. However, because the school has worked hard to improve the training and improvement of in-service teachers and strengthen the leadership of teachers' work, since 1957, the performance of graduates from this school in the National Higher Education Entrance Examination has gradually improved. This year, the school's overall average score reached 72.45 points, second only to Fuzhou No. 1 Middle School, which has the best score in the province.

　　Although we have achieved certain achievements in improving the quality of middle school teaching, there are still many shortcomings that need to be further studied and resolved. We believe that under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and with the joint efforts of educators throughout the province, we will definitely be able to overcome any difficulties and shortcomings in our work, overcome right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions, and further improve the quality of teaching in secondary education.

　　在胜利的基础上继续迈进
　　中共福建省委常委　林修德
    教学是学校的主要任务。在贯彻党的教育方针的前提下，提高教学质量是一个战略性的任务。福建省各级中学领导干部，经过了几年来的实践，才从思想上解决了这个问题。特别是在今年1、2月中央教育工作会议之后，大家对教学工作的重要性有了更加明确的认识。
    要搞好教学，学校党组织就必须下决心加强对教学工作的领导，克服畏难情绪和单纯依赖“专家”走专家路线的思想。在教学上单纯依赖“专家”走专家路线，势必走上脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的道路；而且单纯依赖“专家”也不能充分调动师生的积极性，克服前进中的困难，迅速提高教学质量。近年来大家逐渐明确了领导教学是进一步巩固党在学校中的领导权的问题，因此领导教学的决心就更大了。凡事就怕认真，只要认起真来，就能把事情办好。我们就是根据这一条经验，把福建省中学的领导干部动员起来，加强了对教学工作的领导。在领导教学中，还有一个思想障碍，就是认为福建省的师资、设备差，没有信心赶上先进省、市的水平，甘居中游。我们充分估计了福建省提高教学质量的有利条件，如党委对学校工作很重视，几年来学校的政治思想工作有很大的成绩，师生的政治觉悟提高较快，师生教和学的态度都较认真，省里有些学校在领导教学、提高教学质量方面已经积累了一些经验，以及全省工农业生产高潮的推动和影响等。这些，都说明我们虽然在比较困难的条件下，只要加强主观努力，是可以在教学质量方面赶上先进省、市水平的。中共福建省委在几次大的生产高潮中，也都把提高教学质量的问题，作为向各学校师生动员的口号，布置各级党委去抓，这就更加鼓舞了全体中学师生的革命干劲，并且保证了中学教学工作能在正确的方向下全面提高。
    我们动员全体中学师生为提高教学质量而努力，但绝不允许走资产阶级的老路，把教学工作引导到脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的方向去。我们只能向无产阶级的方向提高，不能走向资产阶级的方向，只能用无产阶级的教育思想进行指导，不能让任何资产阶级的教育思想去进行指导。因此，在教学工作中加强思想领导是首要的环节。有些学校一强调提高教学质量，就不愿意搞政治运动和生产劳动，害怕政治运动和生产劳动会降低教学质量。我们坚决地和这种思想进行了斗争。实践证明，有一些教学质量提高较快的学校，正是党的领导比较坚强，教学和生产劳动、政治和业务结合得比较好的学校。一些原来基础较好的学校，由于他们把政治和业务、劳动和教学对立起来，一碰到运动就顾前顾后，犹豫摇摆，党的方针、政策不能彻底贯彻，师生的积极性不能充分调动，反而不能提高教学质量。当然，在大的教育革命运动过程中，及时建立起无产阶级的教学秩序来是很重要的。福建省各中学参加大炼钢铁运动以后，立即根据省委的指示，以教学为中心，全面安排和组织了学校工作。各个学校在“争取政治、教学、劳动三丰收”的口号下，既抓紧了教学，又加强了政治思想教育，又合理排安了生产劳动。
    在领导教学工作中，领导干部必须深入实际，掌握教学工作的具体情况，从实际出发，解决问题。在学校领导干部中，常见的有两种情况：一种是接触实际不够，只是一般地提口号和要求，一般化地进行领导；一种是虽然能够深入到一个班、一个组去，但往往看不到全局或只是纯业务性地、枝枝节节地进行领导。我们认为学校领导干部既要深入实际，了解师生的教和学的情况，又要认真学习党的方针、政策和上级指示，抓住教学中的主要问题，不失时机地加以解决。比如前几年，许多教师不重视教学大纲，对各科教学的目的和任务不明确，对新教材钻研不够，教学中存在许多自由主义的现象。学校的领导干部就及时地要求教师认真学习教学大纲，钻研新教材，并且帮助一两个教研组做出成绩，推动一般，加强了对教学的组织领导。
    正确处理师生关系，贯彻群众路线，是提高教学质量的一个关键。要正确地处理好师生关系，必须首先贯彻在党的领导下，在教学相长的原则下，发挥教师主导作用的原则。我们要求教师全面关心学生和严格要求学生；特别要求教师在认真备课、加强课堂教学的同时，注意经常研究、掌握学生的学习情况，经常召开师生座谈会，倾听学生对教学的意见，和学生打成一片，克服主观主义、脱离学生实际的教学方法。许多学校在新生入学之初，教师们就深入调查研究学生的知识基础；在教学过程中，他们也经常检查教和学当中存在的问题，及时解决；在每年期中、期末、他们就更全面地进行调查、研究，帮助学生订复习计划。他们这些工作都是在和学生共同合作下进行的。学生们一般的都能既尊重教师，又及时向教师提出意见。各学校也经常教育学生，采取正确的态度对待教师，因而教师是比较满意的。其次，要充分激发学生旺盛的求知欲，培养学生勤学苦练的精神。在这方面，我们注意发挥了共青团和少先队的作用。几年来我们通过共青团和少先队不间断地向学生进行学习目的性的教育，进行了如何正确对待政治和业务、学习和劳动、理论和实际等方面的教育，并且注意运用表扬先进，树立标兵等方法，鼓舞学生的学习热情。
    师资的培养、提高工作，是提高教学质量的另一个重要方面。解放初期，福建省中学教师不到三千人，现在已经扩大到一万余人。1958年前全省只有一所师范学院，培养的师资远不能满足教育事业迅速发展的需要，因而几年来扩大教师来源的主要办法是培养大批的小学教师、高中毕业生到初中任教，并从初中教师中选拔、培养一批人到高中任教。
    对教师的培养提高，有政治和业务等方面。这里着重谈一谈提高教师文化水平和业务能力的办法。在这方面主要的是：一、“以老带新”，由学校中有教学经验的、水平较高的教师帮助新教师，采取“先听后讲”、“边教边学”等办法。二、成立省、专、县各级教师进修机构，通过举办各种教学讲习会，召开教学座谈会，分批轮训等办法，提高教师。三、开展校际教学研究活动，以师资条件较好的学校带动和帮助条件较差的学校。四、组织教师参加函授学习。采取以上措施，对培养提高师资，保证教学质量起了很大的作用。诏安一中是一所从初中发展成为一千四百多人的完全中学，目前全校教师六十一人，大学毕业的只有六人，占10％，而高中毕业程度的却有二十五人，占41％，全校教师中校龄未满五年的计三十五人，占57.4％。但由于该校努力做好在职教师的培养提高工作，加强对教师工作的领导，从1957年开始，这个学校的毕业生，参加全国高等学校招生考试的成绩逐步提高，今年该校总平均成绩达72.45分，仅次于全省成绩最好的福州一中。
    我们在提高中学的教学质量方面虽然取得了一定的成就，但还存在不少缺点，需要继续研究解决。我们相信，在党的八届八中全会号召下，在全省教育工作者的共同努力下，一定能够克服工作中的任何困难和缺点，克服右倾思想和右倾情绪，把中等教育的教学质量再提高一步。
