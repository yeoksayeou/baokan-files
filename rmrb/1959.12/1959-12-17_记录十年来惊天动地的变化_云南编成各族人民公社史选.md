Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 16th December: Yunnan Province, inhabited by twenty-one ethnic groups, has compiled a "Selected History of People's Communes of Various Ethnic Groups."

    This "Selected History of People's Communes of Various Ethnic Groups" selects historical materials from thirteen people's communes of more than ten ethnic groups, including Han, Dai, Yi, Bai, Tibetan, Naxi, Hani, Jingpo, and Kawa. It truthfully records the earth-shaking changes that have taken place in the ethnic minority areas of Yunnan Province under the leadership of the Party in the past decade, especially the changes in production, life, and thought of the various ethnic groups after communization. From these histories of communes, people can see that with the people's communes, the infinite wisdom and strength of the various ethnic groups have been fully utilized, and the backwardness of thousands of years is rapidly changing.

    This "Selected History of Communes" was written by combining the efforts of leading worker-peasant masses and intellectuals under the leadership of Party committees at all levels in Yunnan Province. Because it comes directly from the working people and expresses the rich feelings of the working people, it reads as if one sees the people and hears their voices.

    据新华社昆明16日电　有二十一个民族居住的云南省，已编成一部各族人民公社史选。

    这部公社史选是云南省各级党委领导工农群众与知识分子结合写成的。由于它直接来自劳动人民，表达了劳动人民的丰富感情，因而读起来如见其人，如闻其声。
