    Zhang Fengge, Red Banner Pacesetter of the Forest
    By our reporter Bai Hao
    The vast, snowy forests of the Greater Khingan Range are adorned with glistening silver. Along the logging roads stretching into the deep mountains and dense forests, one "long dragon" after another speeds along. Despite the rugged and slippery mountain roads, they cannot stop the heroic truck drivers from hauling timber in trains. Zhang Fengge is one of the leaders in promoting the train-style timber transportation method in the Greater Khingan Range forest area, and now he is one of the most active on the icy and snowy roads.
    Last summer, when the tide of technical innovation and technical revolution swept over the forest, Zhang Fengge's heart was stirred. He thought, if others can implement train-style timber transportation on relatively flat roads, why can't we do train-style timber transportation on roads with nine ridges and eighteen slopes? At that time, people who emphasized the difficult conditions did not agree with his idea, saying that it would not work to pull trains on nine ridges and eighteen slopes. However, Zhang Fengge, a daring and capable hero and member of the Communist Youth League, was determined to make the high mountains and dangerous peaks bow their heads. Using his years of accumulated experience, combined with experience he had learned from others, he first pulled two trailers loaded with timber, passing through "Mount Motian" and "South Heaven Gate." Then he pulled four trailers and passed through these dangerous peaks again. Those who originally thought it "wouldn't work" had to admit defeat in the face of the facts. Soon, the Party Committee of the Greater Khingan Range Forestry Administration held an on-site meeting, and Zhang Fengge gave a wonderful performance, transporting more than 180 cubic meters of timber at once with ten trailers. The load capacity exceeded more than eight times the previous amount, setting a new national record for timber transportation. Subsequently, Yang Zhenqi and Jiang Zhiliang also drove "long dragons" to catch up, creating records of transporting 200 to 250 cubic meters of timber at a time. Drivers all learned from them, and so the forest's cars all became "long dragons." Previously, a car could only transport about ten cubic meters of timber at a time, and with one trailer, it could only transport about twenty cubic meters. Now, drivers routinely carry two to four trailers at a time, transporting thirty to forty cubic meters of timber.
    Zhang Fengge is not satisfied with his existing achievements. After realizing train-style timber transportation, he felt that one car and one contract team could not be well integrated with the loading process, which limited the development of train-style timber transportation. He suggested that several cars form a mixed contract team, and that the trailers be pre-dropped and pre-loaded to shorten the waiting time for loading and unloading. This suggestion was adopted. Since then, Zhang Fengge has led a mixed contract team (composed of four cars), and everyone has cooperated and helped each other, using collective strength to create many high-yield records. On a mountain road with steep slopes and uneven surfaces, he pulled three trailers, and each car averaged 317 cubic meters of timber per day, collectively creating a high-yield record that had never been seen on this mountain road. In this way, they continued to leap forward, finally stepping into 1960 half a year ahead of schedule.
    Like all advanced producers, Zhang Fengge not only dares to think and create, but also regards helping others as his bounden duty. Once, he was sent to support the first team in transporting timber. On the road, he encountered Zhao Jingguo's seven trailers from the first team running ahead at a slower speed. At this time, Zhang Fengge's assistant planned to overtake them. Everyone knew that to overtake, you had to ask the car in front to give way. However, it is easy to have an accident when a long train gives way. Zhang Fengge said to his assistant: "Zhao Jingguo wants to create a high record this time, which is related to the ideological liberation of the first team. Let's follow behind and help take care of them!" When several pieces of wood fell from Zhao Jingguo's third trailer and broke the triangle bracket, Zhang Fengge did not hesitate to unload the triangle bracket from his car and install it on Zhao Jingguo's car, helping Zhao Jingguo successfully create this high-yield record.
    Last fall, the workers of the motor vehicle repair plant of the Tulihe Forestry Bureau, built a large bus. Zhang Fengge passed by here and saw that Chen Falin's locomotive could not be started, so he immediately reached out to help. Zhang Fengge picked up the gasoline bowl and slowly poured oil into the carburetor. Suddenly, a few sparks flew from the carburetor, and the gasoline bowl immediately burned into a ball of fire. His hands, covered with gasoline, were also ignited. People standing beside him shouted urgently: Throw away the oil bowl quickly. However, Zhang Fengge's first thought was not for himself, but for the brand-new bus and the two gasoline barrels next to the bus. He gritted his teeth, endured the pain, and let the gasoline fire burn his hands until the gasoline in the bowl was almost burned out. Others used raincoats to extinguish the flames on his hands. His right hand was already covered with large blisters. This spirit of cherishing national wealth truly deserves to be called heroic. (Attached picture)

    林海红旗手张凤阁
    本报记者　白皓
    皑皑白雪，把大兴安岭林区装扮得银光闪闪。那些伸往深山密林的运材公路线上，一条接着一条的“长龙”驰骋着。尽管山路崎岖溜滑，也阻挡不了英雄的汽车司机们的列车运材。张凤阁是大兴安岭林区推行列车式运材法的带头人之一，现在，又是冰雪道上最活跃的一个。
    去年夏天，当技术革新和技术革命的浪潮涌到林海的时候，张凤阁的心沸腾起来了。他想，别人在较平坦的公路上能推行列车式运材法，难道在九岭十八坡的路上就不能搞列车化吗？当时，强调条件困难的人是不赞成他的想法的，他们说，九岭十八坡上拉列车是行不通的。但，敢想敢干的英雄——共青团员张凤阁一定要高山险岭低头。他运用自己多年积累的经验，结合从别人学来的经验，先拉着两个满载木材的拖车，走过了“摩天岭”和“南天门”，接着他又拉起四节拖车，又通过了这些险岭。原来那些认为“行不通”的人在事实面前服输了。不久，大兴安岭林业管理局党委召开了现场会议，张凤阁作了一次精采表演，用十节拖车一次运材一百八十多立方米。载运量超过往日的八倍多，创全国运材新纪录。接着，杨振起、姜志良也驾驶着“长龙”追了上来，分别创造了一次运材二百到二百五十多立方米的纪录。司机们都纷纷向他们学习，于是林海的汽车都变成了“长龙”。以前，一辆汽车一次运材不过十立方米，带一个拖车一次也只能运材二十立方米左右。现在，司机们一次带两个到四个拖车，运材三、四十立方米，这已经是平常的事了。
    张凤阁并不满足已有的成就。在运材汽车实现列车化以后，他感到一辆汽车一个包车组不能和装车工序很好衔接，限制了列车式运材法的发展。他又建议几辆汽车组成一个混合包车组，拖车实行预甩预装，缩短等装等卸的时间。这个建议被采纳了。从此，张凤阁带领了一个混合包车组（由四辆汽车组成），大家协作互助，用集体力量创造了多次高产纪录。在一条坡度大和凸凹不平的山路上，拉了三节拖车，而且每辆汽车平均每日运量达三百一十七立方米，集体创造了这条山路上从未有过的高产纪录。就这样不断跃进，终于提前半年跨进了1960年。
    像所有的先进生产者一样，张凤阁不仅自己敢想敢创造，还把帮助别人看做是自己应尽的责任。有一次，他被派去支援第一小队运材。路上，碰到第一小队赵经国的七节拖车在前面用较慢的速度跑着，这时，张凤阁的助手打算超到前面去，谁都知道，要超车就得叫前面的车躲开道。但是，长列车躲道，很容易出事故。张凤阁对助手说：“赵经国这次要创高纪录，关系到第一小队的思想解放，咱们就跟在后边，帮着照看吧！”当赵经国的第三节拖车上有几根木材掉下来砸断三角架的时候，张凤阁毫不犹豫地将自己车上的三角架卸下来，装到赵经国的车上，帮助赵经国成功地创造了这次高产纪录。
    去年秋天，图里河林业局汽车修配厂的工人们，配制了一辆大客车。张凤阁路过这里，碰上陈发林机车发动不起来，马上就伸手帮忙。张凤阁拿起汽油碗往汽化器里慢慢注油，忽然汽化器里几星电火飞起，汽油碗立刻烧成了火团。他沾满了汽油的双手也被燃烧起来。站在一旁的人急促地叫喊：快把油碗扔掉。可是，张凤阁首先想到的不是自己，而是崭新的大客车和客车旁边的两个汽油桶。他咬着牙，忍着痛，让汽油烈火烧着自己的手，直到碗里的汽油快要烧完，别人用雨衣扑灭了他手上的火焰，他的右手已烧得满手大泡了。这种爱护国家财富的精神，真不愧为英雄本色。（附图片）
