Several Major Wild Plant Raw Materials

    Cocklebur:
    A major wild plant oilseed, produced all over the country, especially in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China, where the yield is higher and the quality is better. Cocklebur contains about 20% oil. Cocklebur oil can be used as a raw material for paints, inks, soaps, etc., and can also be used as hardened oil. Cocklebur oil cake is similar in nature to soybean cake and is a good fertilizer.
    Dragon Beard Grass:
    Also known as goat beard grass, it is a perennial herb mainly produced in Southwest and South Central China. Dragon beard grass is tensile, and farmers used to use it to weave straw sandals, straw ropes, rain capes, etc. In recent years, after trial use by various local paper industry departments, it has been proven to be a good raw material for papermaking, which can be used to manufacture high-grade paper such as coated printing paper, typing paper, and carbon paper.
    Red Root:
    The root bark of the climbing rose, it is a very good tanning extract raw material, containing more than 20% tannin. According to the actual production results of the Yichang Limin Chemical Factory in Hubei, the tannin extract made from a mixture of 60% red root and 40% acorn cup is of good quality and quantity. Red root can also be used to replace cutch bark for dyeing fishing nets. Fishing nets dyed with it are resistant to corrosion, have good color, and are low in cost. It is currently widely used in coastal areas such as Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu.
    Cherokee Rose:
    Also known as wild pomegranate, dinglang, mountain chicken head, etc., it is a wild shrub, mostly produced in mountainous and hilly areas of southern China, maturing after the frost. Cherokee rose contains more than 20% sugars, as well as a small amount of citric acid and malic acid. In addition to medicinal use, it can also be used to make wine and sugar.
    Camphor Tree Seeds:
    The fruit of the camphor tree, produced in the Jiangnan region, with larger yields in Jiangxi and Hunan. The pericarp of the camphor tree seed contains about 24% oil, which has a fragrant odor and is a good raw material for soap. The kernel of the camphor tree contains more than 45% oil, but the quality of the oil is inferior to that of the pericarp oil. Therefore, the pericarp and kernel are generally mixed and pressed, and more than 40 catties of oil can be produced per 100 catties of camphor tree seeds. It is now used as a raw material for soaps, lubricants, and cosmetics. (Attached picture)

    几种大宗的野生植物原料
    苍耳子：
    是一种大宗的野生植物油料，全国各地都产，尤以华北、东北、西北等地产量较多，质量较好。苍耳子含油量在20％左右。苍耳子油可作油漆、油墨、肥皂等原料，还可作硬化油；苍耳子油饼和大豆饼的性质差不多，是一种很好的肥料。龙须草：
    也叫羊胡子草，是多年生草本植物，主要产于西南、中南地区。龙须草富有拉力，过去农民多用来编草鞋、草绳、蓑衣等。近几年经各地造纸工业部门试用，证明是一种很好的造纸原料，可制造胶版印刷纸、打字纸、复写纸等高级纸张。
    红根：
    是木香花的根皮，是一种很好的栲胶原料，含单宁20％以上。湖北宜昌利民化工厂实际生产结果，利用60％红根和40％橡碗混合制成的栲胶，量质很好。红根还可代替栲皮染渔网，用它染的渔网耐腐力强，色泽好，成本也低。目前在福建、浙江、江苏等沿海地区已普遍推广利用。
    金樱子：
    又叫山石榴、丁榔、山鸡头等，是一种野生小灌木，多产于江南山区和丘陵地带，霜降后成熟。金樱子含有20％以上的醣类，并有少量的柠檬酸、苹果酸，除作药用外，还可以酿酒和制糖。樟　树　子：
    樟树的子实，产于江南地区，以江西、湖南等地的产量较大。樟树子的果皮含油量在24％左右，气味芳香，是很好的肥皂原料。樟树果仁含油量在45％以上，但油的质量次于果皮油。因此一般都是采取果皮、果仁混合压榨，每百斤樟树子可产油四十多斤，现在已被用来作肥皂、滑润油和化妆品原料。（附图片）
