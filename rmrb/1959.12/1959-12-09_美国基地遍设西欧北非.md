Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: A recent issue of "U.S. News & World Report" published an article introducing the vast chain of bases the United States has established around socialist countries to promote its aggressive policies, control other countries, and create tension.

The article stated that in Spain, the United States has spent more than $400 million building three major bomber bases, which are now almost complete. There is also a large U.S. supply depot, a naval base, and fuel pipelines connecting these air bases. U.S. jet bombers refuel and resupply at these bases and are ready to deploy immediately.

In the United Kingdom, U.S. Air Force personnel are using fifteen Royal Air Force bases. This is the center of the Strategic Air Command's overseas bomber forces.

In France, (due to the discord between the United States and France over the control of nuclear warheads) most of the U.S. combat aircraft are being withdrawn, but U.S. Air Force personnel will still maintain six airfields, which after December, will mainly be used to supply transport aircraft, cargo, and tactical reconnaissance aircraft, and retain supply facilities for combat aircraft.

In West Germany, U.S. jet combat aircraft—mainly fighter-bombers and fighter-interceptors—are using five air bases. Several divisions of jet-propelled missiles—"Matador" and "Mas" missiles—are also stationed in West Germany, with a range that can reach Eastern Europe.

Libya: After the relocation of the Seventeenth Air Force Command, Wheelus will be used as a base for fighter-bombers and air-sea rescue training, and as a small station for the Military Air Transport Service.

In Saudi Arabia, the large airport built by the United States in Dhahran will be able to provide U.S. jet bombers with landing, refueling, and maintenance facilities in emergencies.

In Morocco, although the United States has been forced to agree to dismantle its bases, B-47 and B-52 jet bomber forces will continue to fly over here from the United States in the coming years. The large bombers withdrawn by the United States from Morocco will be transferred to Europe.

The magazine also discussed the U.S. establishment of missile bases, saying that the United States will set up bases in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Turkey for missiles with a range of 1,500 miles. Previously, it was planned to send ten U.S. intermediate-range missile squadrons to Europe—deploying them in France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Turkey, and possibly West Germany.

The magazine also published a chart illustrating the current situation of some U.S. bases in Europe and Africa.

    美国基地遍设西欧北非
    据新华社7日讯　不久前的一期“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志刊载一篇文章，介绍了美国为推行侵略政策、控制其它国家和制造紧张局势而围绕社会主义国家建立的庞大基地锁链。
    文章说，在西班牙，美国已经花了四亿多美元修建三个主要的轰炸机基地，目前差不多都完全建成了。另外还有一个大型的美国供应仓库、一个海军基地和一个同这些空军基地联结的燃料管。美国的喷气式轰炸机在这些基地加油、得到供应并且随时准备立刻出动。
    在英国，美国空军人员正在使用十五个皇家空军基地。这里是战略空军海外轰炸部队的中心。
    在法国，（由于美法两国在控制核弹头问题上的龌龊）大部分美国作战飞机都在撤走，但是美国空军人员仍将保持六个机场，在12月以后，这些机场将主要供应运输机、货运和战术侦察机使用，并保留了为作战飞机提供的供应设施。
    在西德，美国喷气作战式飞机——主要是战斗轰炸机和战斗截击机——正在使用五个空军基地。目前好几师喷气推进的导弹——“斗牛士式”和“马斯式”——也驻在西德，它们的射程可以射到东欧。
    利比亚：在十七航空队司令部移出以后，将计划利用惠勒斯作为战斗轰炸机和进行海空救援训练的一个基地并且作为军事空运处的一个小站。
    在沙特阿拉伯，美国在达兰修建大型机场将能够在紧急情况下供美国喷气轰炸机着陆、加油和维修。
    在摩洛哥，虽然美国已被迫同意将撤销它的基地，但是B—47和B—52喷气轰炸机部队在今后几年内将继续从美国飞过这里。美国从摩洛哥撤出的大型轰炸机将转移到欧洲。
    这家杂志还谈到美国建立导弹基地的情况，它说，美国将在英国、意大利和土耳其设立一千五百英里射程的导弹的基地。在此以前，曾计划派遣十个美国中程导弹中队到欧洲去——把它们设置在法国、英国、希腊、意大利、土耳其、以及可能是西德。
    这家杂志还刊载了一张图表，说明美国在欧洲和非洲的一些基地的目前情况。
