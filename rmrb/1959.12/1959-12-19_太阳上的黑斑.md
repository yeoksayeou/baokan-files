    Sunspots
    People often like to use "sunspots" to describe our shortcomings at work; indeed, this metaphor is most appropriate. Compared to the sun, sunspots are insignificant, at most accounting for only a few thousandths of the total area of the sun. These sunspots are not truly black, but merely appear somewhat dark because their temperature is slightly lower than the surrounding area. In reality, the temperature here is still around 4,500 degrees.
    The appearance of sunspots indicates that the sun has high activity. The intense thermonuclear reactions taking place in the sun are the source of the sun's enormous light and heat. It is impossible to imagine that the development of motion in such magnificent and drastic changes would be completely balanced. Therefore, "storms" occur on the sun, causing the hot gases to swirl into vortices. The temperature in the vortices is lower, which is what we see as sunspots. Sunspots are a product of solar activity and cannot exist for long, usually lasting less than a day. [Jin Ming]

### 太阳上的黑斑

     太阳上的黑斑人们常常喜欢用“太阳上的黑斑”来形容我们工作中的缺点；的确，这个比喻是最恰当不过了。和太阳比较起来，黑斑是微乎其微的，最多不过占太阳总面积千分之几，这些黑斑并非真正的黑，仅仅因为温度比周围略低，所以显得有些暗，实际上这里的温度仍有四千五百度左右。
    黑斑的出现表明太阳具有高度的活动性。在太阳中进行的强烈的热核反应，是太阳巨大的光和热的来源，不可能设想在如此宏伟剧烈的变化过程中，运动的发展竟会是完全平衡的，因此，在太阳上发生了“风暴”，使火热的气体卷起了漩涡，漩涡中的温度较低，正是我们看见的黑斑。黑斑是太阳活动的产物，不可能长久存在，通常寿命不到一天。　〔今明〕
