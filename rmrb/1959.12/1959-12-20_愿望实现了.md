    Wishes Fulfilled
    Halimu, Secretary of the Golmud Commune Party Committee
    Since the establishment of our Golmud Commune, we have earnestly implemented the policy of prioritizing animal husbandry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations. This year, the total income from various productions has more than doubled compared to last year. This has not only increased the income of commune members but also expanded reproduction. For example, after the establishment of the commune, we purchased a tractor, two rubber-wheeled carts, thirty breeding rams, and a large number of agricultural and animal husbandry production tools.
    As the income of commune members increased, the vast majority of poor herdsmen moved into new yurts, acquired new clothes and bedding, and every household had a sewing machine, with 50% of the families owning a gramophone. Commune members have all participated in savings, with average savings per household reaching around one hundred yuan.
    These tremendous changes among our Kazakh herdsmen are entirely the result of the Party's correct leadership. Recalling the days before liberation, our Kazakh people wandered everywhere, and the number of people who froze to death and starved to death was countless. My two younger sisters and one younger brother starved to death in a mountain cave to escape the massacre of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Hulmuian, who was in his fifties, worked as a slave for the herdboss for his entire life and never wore a new piece of clothing. This was the tragic life of the Kazakh working people before liberation. Now, the wishes of the herdsmen have been fulfilled.

    愿望实现了
    格尔木公社党委书记　哈力木
    我们格尔木公社一成立，由于认真执行了以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营的方针，今年各项生产总收入比去年增长了一倍多。不但增加了社员收入，还扩大了再生产。如公社成立后，我们就购置了一台拖拉机、两辆胶轮马车、三十只种公羊和大量的农牧业生产工具。
    随着社员收入增加，绝大部分贫苦牧民住上了新帐房，添置了新衣、新被，家家有了缝纫机，50％的人家有了留声机。社员都参加了储蓄，平均每户存款达到一百元左右。
    我们哈萨克族牧民的这些巨大变化，完全是党的正确领导的结果。回想解放前，我们哈萨克族人民到处流浪，冻死、饿死的人难以数计。我的两个妹妹、一个弟弟就是为了躲避蒋匪帮的残杀，饿死在山洞里的五十多岁的乎尔买安给牧主当了一辈子奴隶，从没有穿过一件新衣裳。这就是解放前哈萨克族劳动人民的悲惨生活。现在，牧民的愿望实现了。
