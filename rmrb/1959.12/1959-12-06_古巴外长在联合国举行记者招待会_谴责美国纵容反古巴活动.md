Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 5th: Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa held a press conference at the United Nations, condemning anti-Cuban activities originating from U.S. territory.

	Roa said that the arrest of five people in Miami, Florida, (USA) who attempted to transport incendiary bombs to Cuba, which was confirmed by the U.S. Customs authorities, is yet another proof of the aforementioned conspiracy.

	Roa said: "Faced with the anti-Cuban propaganda war in newspapers and the bombing of Cuba, the entire Cuban people have risen up against any attempt by the enemy to obstruct Cuba's firm determination to achieve national independence and accelerate economic development."

    罗亚说，在（美国）弗罗里达州迈阿密逮捕了五个企图往古巴运送燃烧弹的人，这件事是美国海关当局确认的，这就又一次证明了上述阴谋活动。
