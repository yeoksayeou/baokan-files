    The Sound of Xiamen
    Li Li
    For nearly ten years, I have lived in Xiamen. I am familiar with this gateway in the southeast of the motherland. The magnolia trees with their fragrance spreading for miles, the phoenix trees with their flowers as red as a sea of fire, Gulangyu like a colorful boat, the iridescent seashells... However, I am even more familiar with the sound of artillery fire and the sound of blasting rocks. This is the characteristic of Xiamen, and the interweaving of these two sounds reflects the changes in this frontline city of Xiamen.

    For the people in the rear, who have been engaged in peaceful construction for ten years, the sound of artillery fire is no longer so familiar. But here, it has been rumbling intermittently for thousands of days. In their spare time from labor, people always think: if Chiang Kai-shek did not still occupy Jinmen outside Xiamen Harbor, if the US imperialist troops did not still occupy Taiwan, wouldn't the sound of artillery fire here disappear? Wouldn't we be able to engage in peaceful construction with complete peace of mind...? Every time I hear the rumbling artillery fire in the pine waves and sea tides late at night, I also think about this question, and I think about it a lot...

    The changes in the sound of artillery fire are also thought-provoking. In the first few years after liberation, on the Xiamen front at Hecuo Township and Jinmen, which are only over four thousand meters apart on the sea, shells flew back and forth, and it was almost impossible to distinguish whose artillery fire was louder, the enemy's or ours. But punishing the Chiang troops on August 23rd last year was completely different. The enemy cried out that our artillery fire was like "heavy rain." I remember that it was precisely at the moment when we were creating "artificial rain of bullets" for the enemy that I watched an excellent artillery battle on the front line. It was a clear day, nearing dusk, with half the sky painted with red clouds and the sea sparkling with thousands of golden lights. In an instant, with a few artillery shots, then tens of thousands of shells fired in unison, whistling through the air, and a layer of smoke was blasted out on Jinmen Island, while the enemy on Jinmen Island, although also firing back at us, was immediately silenced by our artillery fire.

    However, as this artillery battle went deeper, the artillery fire heard in Xiamen became so regular, once every other day, stopping on even days, and sounding on odd days. Until now, the artillery fire is still sounding in such a regular manner. Of course, sometimes the regularity is also broken, and the artillery fire does not sound even on odd days. But the people on the front line of Xiamen have completely become accustomed to this kind of life.

    In the changes in the sound of artillery fire, the people of Xiamen have figured out the rules of frontline life, and like a piece of pure steel, they have become stronger and stronger in the flames of war. In the first few years after liberation, some people wanted to move to the rear as soon as they heard the sound of artillery fire, but gradually, as soon as people heard the sound of artillery fire, they ran to the front line to deliver boiled water, repair roads, transport shells, and even participate in the artillery battle. Who, young and old, male and female, did not strive to be the first! They are not only brave and resourceful, but everyone has become an "artillery fire expert." If you chat with them, they will tell you, this is the sound of a cannon, that is the sound of coastal artillery, this is what we fired, that is what the enemy fired, what time the enemy fires artillery most often, and how to take cover so as not to be injured by shrapnel...

    The people of Xiamen, together with the People's Liberation Army, do not forget their intense productive labor in the sustained battle. In places close to the forward positions, the accumulated shell craters have disappeared. The mountains are beautiful, the waters are clear, and the fields are filled with laughter and singing. The artillerymen and frontline people who fought side by side last year are now tilling the land together again. Behind the positions, several patches of cabbage are green and lush. Under the banyan tree, a pigsty is filled with pigs turning around in circles. The soldiers, in the intervals between artillery battles, beautified their homes, opened up vegetable gardens, and put forward the slogan of self-sufficiency in non-staple food production, striving for surplus, and supporting the frontline people.

    In this way, the frontline people, with the help of the coastal defense troops, have achieved a bumper harvest in the flames of war. Those rice fields full of shell craters have increased production by more than 20% compared to last year. The sound of artillery fire has not disrupted the songs of harvest.

    In the sound of war artillery fire that has been rumbling for ten years, there is another kind of artillery fire mixed in, that is the sound of blasting rocks, the sound of peaceful construction. If you have just arrived in Xiamen, you certainly cannot distinguish whether this is the sound of war artillery fire or the sound of blasting rocks. These two sounds are so similar, and so wonderfully intertwined. From the day there was the sound of war artillery fire on the Xiamen front, there was also the sound of blasting rocks. The sound of blasting rocks is increasing year by year, which reflects the prosperity of Xiamen's construction year by year.

    Walking into Xiamen, the mountains you see are all made of stone. This is not ordinary stone, but strong, white granite. It is said that Xiamen Island was formed by submarine igneous rocks. After so many ages of changes, the granite here has become so good and so white. Granite is the characteristic of Xiamen's construction. And the sound of explosions for quarrying granite has also become the most characteristic sound of Xiamen's construction. I clearly remember the scene of exploding granite once. It was a dusk, we squatted in a fort left over from the Kuomintang, looking out from the gun hole. A granite mountain a few hundred meters away stood majestic in the strong wind. At this time, no one was seen around. Only a whistle was heard, and a series of cannon shots sounded with a boom. Suddenly,碎石纷飞 flying rocks, thick smoke soared into the sky, and amazing fire shone in the thick smoke. This scene was not much inferior to the artillery bombardment of Jinmen. When the smoke cleared, and looking closer, the granite was scattered all over the mountain. Ah! It was this kind of artillery fire that made a ten-mile-long sea embankment float on the sea, and turned Xiamen from an island into a peninsula. When you take the train of the Yingxia Railway across the sea embankment, seeing the waves rolling on both sides of the train, you simply will not believe that you are sitting on the train, but think that you are sitting on a ship. At this time, you can't help but exclaim the greatness of this sea embankment. Some people say that the sea embankment is the manifestation of the wisdom and perseverance of the people of Xiamen. To understand the changes in Xiamen and the people of Xiamen, outsiders always see the sea embankment first. As for other aspects of change, of course, they are not as easily seen as the sea embankment.

    I am familiar with Xiamen's past, and I know this kind of change that cannot be seen through at a glance. Looking back at history, Xiamen was forcibly opened as a trading port for five countries by imperialism in 1842. From then on, this seaport became an undefended gateway, and imperialist warships and robber-like merchant ships freely docked in the port, thick smoke polluted the clean sky, and oil stains floated on the surging Lujiang River. Xiamen! How much pain have you borne! I saw you, under the invasion of imperialism, turn into a deformed monster! At that time, when I walked on the street, on the left were money houses, gold shops, restaurants, and dance halls, and on the right were still dance halls, restaurants, gold shops, and money houses. At that time, I couldn't see any factories. I saw rubber factory and cannery machines shipped back from Kuala Lumpur by overseas Chinese, abandoned on the side of Lujiang Road, exposed to wind and rain…

    The sound of construction artillery fire for ten years has changed the deformed Xiamen. The consumer city has become an industrial city with a preliminary scale. After crossing the sea embankment by train, you can see factories one after another along the way. Near the railway station, there is a steel factory. Last year, enemy shells exploded here. This area was stained with the blood of workers. However, in less than a year, the steel factory was built, and steel was smelted and rolled. In the dozens of miles around the steel factory, a new industrial area has been formed in recent years, with dozens of factories such as electrical machinery factories, machine factories, electrochemical factories, rubber factories, and canneries. In the distant suburbs, another new industrial area is under construction, with textile factories, glass factories, soda ash factories, and sugar factories. At present, there are more than 260 factories in the city, including steel, machinery, chemical, textile, and food industries. Now, when you walk on the street, look at the dazzling array of products in the shops: cod liver oil, canned food, towels, gauze shirts, radios, record players, bicycles, all labeled with the Xiamen trademark. More commodities are sold far and wide at home and abroad.

    Now, when the sound of artillery fire comes from the distant sea, and the sound of blasting rocks comes from the high mountains, I face the sea breeze, stroll along the coast, and on the opposite bank is the sea garden Gulangyu. The morning sun is dedicating its brilliance to Sunlight Rock, where the national hero Zheng Chenggong trained his sailors. At this time, a bell rings, that is the bell of the Customs Building. This bell has been ringing like this for decades, but the era is completely different. Look! Our gunboats are patrolling back, and merchant ships are setting off loaded with Xiamen's industrial products; the sky is bluer above the blue sea...

    厦门的声音
    李力
    近十年来，我一直住在厦门。我熟悉这个祖国东南的门户。那香飘十里的玉兰树，那花红似火海的凤凰木，那彩船一般的鼓浪屿，那五光十色的贝壳……。可是，我更熟悉那炮声和开山炸石声。这是厦门的特色，这两种声音的交织，正反映了厦门这个前线城市的变化。
    炮声，对已经进行了十年和平建设的后方人民来说，再也不是那么熟悉的了。可是这里，几千个日子里断断续续的轰鸣着。人们在劳动之余，心中总在想：要不是蒋介石还窃踞着厦门港外的金门，要不是美帝国主义的军队还侵占着台湾，这里的炮声不是没有了吗？我们不是可以完全安心地进行和平建设……。每当深夜，在那松涛海啸中传来隆隆炮声时，我也想着这个问题，并且想得很多很多……。
    炮声的变化，也真耐人寻味。解放初的几年，在厦门前线何厝乡和金门这个相隔只四千多米海面上，炮弹嘘嘘往还穿飞，几乎分不出敌我双方谁的炮声更响亮。但去年8月23日惩罚蒋军，却完全不同。敌人大叫我们的炮击像“下大雨”。我记得，正是我们给敌人制造“人工弹雨”的时刻，我在前沿看过一场出色的炮战。那是一个晴朗的日子，时近黄昏，蓝天上抹上半边红霞，海面上闪耀千道金光。一霎间，几声炮响，接着，万弹齐发，排空啸飞，在金门岛炸出一层烟雾，而金门岛的敌人虽然也向我们开炮还击，但一下子又被我们的炮声压哑了。
    但是，当这场炮战深入一步时，在厦门听到的炮声，就是那么有规律的了，隔一天一次，双日停，单日响。直到现在，炮声仍在这样有规律的响着，当然，有时规律也被打破，单日炮声也不响了。而厦门前沿的人民，却已完全习惯了这样的生活了。
    在炮声的变化中，厦门人民摸透了前线生活的规律，像一块纯钢一样，在战火中越炼越刚强。解放初几年，有人一听到炮声，就想往后方转移，可是渐渐地，人们一听到炮声，就往火线上跑，送开水，修公路，运炮弹，甚至开炮参战，男女老少谁不人人争先！他们不但勇敢机智，而且人人成为“炮声专家”。和他们一扯，他们就会告诉你，这是加农炮声，那是海岸炮声，这是我们打过去的，那是敌人打过来的，什么时间敌人最常打炮，怎样掩蔽才不会为弹片所伤……。
    厦门的人民同解放军一道，在持久的战斗中不忘紧张的生产劳动。在紧靠前沿阵地的地方，累累的弹坑不见了。山明水秀，田野一片笑声伴歌声，去年并肩作战的炮兵和前线人民，又在一起耕耘。阵地后面，几畦白菜，绿油油一片。榕树底下，一栏猪圈，猪儿团团地转。战士们在炮战空隙时，美化了家园，开辟了菜园，提出了副食品生产自给，争取有余，支援前线人民的口号。
    就是这样，前沿人民在海防部队帮助下，在战火中取得了丰收。那些满是弹坑的稻田，比去年增产二成多，炮声，并没有打乱丰收的歌声。
    在十年不断轰鸣的战争炮声中，夹杂着另一种炮声，那是开山炸石的炮声，和平建设的声音。要是你刚到厦门来，你当然分不出这是战争的炮声还是炸石的炮声，这两种声音是那么相似，又是那么奇妙地交织在一起。厦门前线从有战争炮声的那天起，也就有了炸石的炮声。开山炸石的炮声一年比一年多，正反映了厦门的建设一年比一年繁荣。
    走进厦门，望见的山，山山皆石，这不是普通的石，是质坚色白的花岗岩。据说，厦门岛是海底火成岩形成的，经过多少年代的变化，这里的花岗石就变得这么好，这么白。花岗石，是厦门建设的特色。而开采花岗石的爆炸声，也成为厦门建设中最有特色的声音。我清楚的记得一次爆炸花岗石的景色，那是一个黄昏，我们蹲在一个国民党遗留下来的堡垒里，从枪眼里望出去，几百米外的一座花岗石山，在狂风中巍然屹立着。这时，四周不见人影。只听得一声哨子叫，轰轰地一阵连珠炮响，顿时碎石纷飞，浓烟冲上天，浓烟里闪耀着惊人的火光。这情景，并不比那排炮轰金门逊色多少。等到烟消雾散，近前一看，花岗石崩得满山皆是。啊！就是这样的炮声，使海上浮起了一条十里长堤，使厦门由海岛变半岛。当你乘坐鹰厦铁路的火车经过海堤时，看到车两旁波涛滚滚，简直会使你不相信自己是坐在火车上，而以为是坐在轮船上，你这时不禁要惊呼这海堤的伟大。有人说，海堤是厦门人的智慧和毅力的表现。认识厦门的变化和厦门人民，外来的人总是从海堤入眼的。至于其他方面的变化，当然不是像海堤这样，一眼便可以望穿的。
    我熟知厦门的过去，我知道这种不是一眼可以望穿的变化。翻开历史一看，厦门在1842年被帝国主义强辟为五国通商口岸。从那时起，这个海港成为不设防的门户，帝国主义的军舰和强盗式的商船自由停泊在港口，浓烟染污洁静的天空，油污飘浮在激荡的鹭江。厦门啊！你的身上担负过多少痛苦！我看见你，在帝国主义的侵略下，变成了个畸形的怪物！那时，我走在街上，左边是钱庄、金铺、酒楼、舞厅，右边还是舞厅、酒楼、金铺、钱庄。那时，我看不到什么工厂。我看见华侨从吉隆坡运回来的橡胶厂、罐头厂的机器，弃置鹭江道边，风吹雨淋……。
    十年的建设的炮声，使畸形怪状的厦门改变了，消费的城市变成了初具规模的工业城市了。从火车跨过海堤以后，沿途你就可以看到一座座的厂房。就在火车站的附近，有一座钢厂。去年，敌人的炮弹在这里爆炸过。这片地方，流淌过工人的血。可是，不到一年的时间，钢厂建起来了，炼出钢也轧出了钢。就在钢厂周围几十里地方，几年来已形成了一个新工业区，有电机厂、机器厂、电化厂、橡胶厂、罐头厂等几十个工厂，在远郊区，另一个新工业区正在兴建，有纺织厂、玻璃厂、纯碱厂、糖厂等。目前，全市已有二百六十多个工厂。包括钢铁、机器、化学、纺织和食品等工业。现在，你走在街头，看看商店里那琳琅满目，万紫千红的产品：鱼肝油、罐头、毛巾、纱衫、收音机、唱机、脚踏车，都贴上厦门的商标。更多的商品，还远销国内国外。
    现在，当远海传来炮声，高山又传来炸石声时，我迎着海风，漫步海滨，对岸正是海上花园鼓浪屿，早晨的太阳正以它的光辉，献给民族英雄郑成功操练水兵的日光岩，这时，一阵钟声响起来，那是海关大楼的钟声。这钟声已经这样地敲了几十年，可是时代完全不同了。看！我们的炮艇正巡弋回来，商船满载厦门的工业品出发了；天空在蔚蓝的海面上更加蔚蓝了……。
