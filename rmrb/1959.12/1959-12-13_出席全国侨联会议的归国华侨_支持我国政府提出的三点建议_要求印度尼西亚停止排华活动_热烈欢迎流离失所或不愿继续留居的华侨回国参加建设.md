Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 12th. Returned Overseas Chinese attending the preparatory meeting for the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the First Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese warmly support Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio regarding the large-scale anti-Chinese and discriminatory activities in Indonesia, the serious protest lodged, and the three proposals for a comprehensive resolution of the Overseas Chinese issue. The Returned Overseas Chinese participating in the preparatory meeting unanimously stated that they warmly welcome Overseas Chinese who are displaced or unwilling to continue living in Indonesia to return to the prosperous, strong, and lovable motherland and join the people of the whole country in participating in the motherland's great socialist construction.

Yu Yangzu, Deputy to the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and a Returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that Foreign Minister Chen Yi's proposals are the best way to fairly and reasonably resolve the Indonesian Overseas Chinese issue in a comprehensive way. If the Indonesian government truly hopes to maintain friendly relations between the two countries and truly considers the principles of humanity and justice, rather than taking unilateral and crude actions on the Overseas Chinese issue, then it should not object to these very reasonable proposals from our government. Yu Yangzu said that some reactionary forces in Indonesia have taken the slander that Overseas Chinese are a "fifth column" out of the drawers of the Pentagon in Washington as an excuse to incite anti-Chinese discrimination. Foreign Minister Chen's proposal fully demonstrates that the Chinese people have never and will never intend to use Overseas Chinese to harm any country. Although our country has 650 million people, in order for our country to be built into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, our manpower is not excessive, but rather insufficient. The people of the motherland warmly welcome Overseas Chinese who are displaced or unwilling to continue living in Indonesia to return to the motherland to participate in the great construction cause.

Wang Yuanxing, Deputy to the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and a Returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that the Overseas Chinese economy has long been an integral part of the Indonesian economy. The vast majority of working people among the Overseas Chinese, like the Indonesian people, have suffered from the exploitation of colonialism. The business activities of Overseas Chinese small vendors play a beneficial role in connecting urban and rural exchanges in Indonesia. Countless facts prove that the Overseas Chinese economy is fundamentally different from the colonialist economy. People know that imperialism still maintains huge economic power in Indonesia. Foreign monopoly capital plunders 15 billion rupiahs of exorbitant profits from Indonesia every year. This figure is equivalent to the total revenue stipulated in Indonesia's national fiscal budget. If Indonesia wants to develop its national economy, it should fight against imperialist monopoly capital, not attack Overseas Chinese small vendors. Wang Yuanxing said that our motherland is moving towards the goal of building a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. We need more strength to participate in the motherland's magnificent construction cause. Since Indonesia is so disgusted with Overseas Chinese, persecutes Overseas Chinese, and does not want Overseas Chinese to live in Indonesia, then they have no reason to reject Foreign Minister Chen's proposal. The requirements put forward in Foreign Minister Chen's letter, such as requiring the Indonesian government to adhere to the principle of voluntariness when repatriating Overseas Chinese back to China, allowing them to sell their property and bring back funds, ensuring their safety en route, and implementing repatriation in batches, are completely reasonable, and the Indonesian government has no reason to refuse them.

Wu Yixiu, Deputy to the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Deputy Director of the Department of Internal Medicine at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, and a Returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that the broad masses of Overseas Chinese have always shared weal and woe with the Indonesian people. I remember that during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, a Chinese "warung" (grocery) store owner brought an Indonesian child suffering from smallpox to my clinic for treatment. The Overseas Chinese man held the child tightly, as if holding his own child. When I reminded him that smallpox was very contagious and not to hold the child so tightly, he replied, "It doesn't matter. He is the child of my sick friend, and you must save him no matter what." In the Indonesian people's struggle against Dutch colonialists, many young Overseas Chinese took up arms and fought alongside their Indonesian friends. Our Overseas Chinese in Bogor and Red Cross staff bravely rescued wounded Indonesian revolutionary soldiers, braving the invading army's artillery fire. Similar examples of Overseas Chinese and Indonesian people sharing weal and woe were truly commonplace during my residence in Indonesia. I have always believed that the broad masses of Indonesian people are sympathetic and friendly to our Overseas Chinese. Only a small handful of reactionary elements fostered by imperialism and serving imperialist interests have stirred up the anti-Chinese and discriminatory current. Their rejection of friends and collusion with bandits, their anti-Chinese and discriminatory activities, have increasingly aroused the unease and dissatisfaction of kind Indonesian people and fair-minded people. Wu Yixiu said that Foreign Minister Chen's proposal is completely in line with the interests of the Chinese and Indonesian people, and only detrimental to imperialism and a small group of reactionaries in Indonesia. We hope that the Indonesian government will cherish the friendship between the two peoples, immediately accept Foreign Minister Chen's proposal, stop anti-Chinese discrimination, and negotiate the handling of the Overseas Chinese issue.

Huang Jie, Deputy to the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and a Returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that the Chinese government and people have always been friendly to Indonesia. When Indonesia faced economic difficulties, the Chinese people extended a hand of friendship. In the struggle to quell the rebellion in Indonesia, the Chinese government and people provided firm support and material assistance. Overseas Chinese in Indonesia have an even longer friendship of thousands of years with the Indonesian people. They have worked together with the local people to develop the Indonesian economy. In the struggle against Dutch colonialism and Japanese imperialism, Overseas Chinese fought side by side with the Indonesian people, and many Overseas Chinese even shed their last drop of blood. Since May of this year, Indonesia has unexpectedly stirred up a large-scale and comprehensive anti-Chinese and discriminatory current. The property of Overseas Chinese has suffered huge losses, and their personal safety has been seriously violated. At the same time, some Indonesian newspapers, in order to incite anti-Chinese sentiment among the Indonesian people to cooperate with their discriminatory activities, have disseminated a large number of remarks attacking and slandering our country, and even openly insulted the Chinese people's beloved leaders. The Chinese people cannot but express their utmost indignation at this extremely vicious and extremely unfriendly act of repaying kindness with ingratitude. Huang Jie said that Overseas Chinese are different from the past. In the past, they were helpless orphans overseas, forced by their livelihoods to endure humiliation and live a life dependent on others. However, this tragic situation has long since disappeared after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The powerful socialist motherland has always been concerned about the fate of its compatriots. In the flourishing new era of the motherland, all compatriots residing abroad can return to the warm embrace of the motherland at any time.

    出席全国侨联会议的归国华侨
    支持我国政府提出的三点建议  要求印度尼西亚停止排华活动
    热烈欢迎流离失所或不愿继续留居的华侨回国参加建设
    新华社上海12日电　出席全国侨联一届四次全体委员（扩大）会议预备会议的归国华侨，热烈支持陈毅外长写给印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约的信中对印度尼西亚大规模的反华排华活动，所提出的严重抗议和全面解决华侨问题的三点建议。参加预备会议的归国华侨们一致表示，热烈欢迎流离失所或不愿在印度尼西亚继续留居的华侨，回到繁荣、富强、可爱的祖国，同全国人民一起参加祖国伟大的社会主义建设。
    全国人民代表大会代表、全国侨联副主席、印度尼西亚归侨尤扬祖说，陈毅外交部长的建议是公平合理地全面解决印度尼西亚华侨问题的最好办法，如果印度尼西亚政府真正希望维护两国的友好关系，真正考虑到人道和正义的原则，而不是在华侨问题上采取片面的和粗暴行动的话，那么，就不应该对我国政府这些非常合情合理的建议表示异议。尤扬祖说，印度尼西亚的一部分反动势力从华盛顿的五角大楼的抽屉里，搬出所谓华侨是“第五纵队”的谰言，作为他们煽动反华排华的借口。陈外长的建议充分表明了中国人民从来并且永远不打算利用华侨去损害任何国家。我国虽然有六亿五千万人口，但是为了把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，我国的人力不是多、而是少。祖国人民热烈欢迎流离失所或不愿意在印度尼西亚继续留居的华侨，回到祖国来参加伟大的建设事业。
    全国人民代表大会代表、全国侨联副主席、印度尼西亚归侨王源兴说，华侨经济事实上老早就是印度尼西亚经济的一个组成部分。华侨当中的绝大多数劳动人民，同印度尼西亚人民一样，遭受着殖民主义者的剥削。华侨小商贩的经营活动，对沟通印度尼西亚的城乡交流是起着有益的作用的，无数的事实证明：华侨经济和殖民主义经济是根本不同的。人们知道，帝国主义还在印度尼西亚保有巨大的经济力量。外国垄断资本每年从印度尼西亚掠夺了一百五十亿盾的暴利。这笔数字相当于印度尼西亚国家财政预算所规定的总收入额。如果印度尼西亚要发展民族经济，应该是向帝国主义垄断资本斗争，而不应当向华侨小商贩开刀。王源兴说，我们的祖国正在向着建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义国家的目标迈进，我们需要更多的力量来参加祖国宏伟的建设事业，印度尼西亚既然这样厌恶华侨，迫害华侨，不愿华侨居住在印度尼西亚，那么他们就没有理由拒绝陈外长的建议。陈外长信中提出的要求印度尼西亚政府在遣返华侨回国时要根据自愿原则，允许他们变卖财产并且带回资金、保证他们途中安全、实行分批遣送等，则是完全合情合理的，印度尼西亚政府没有丝毫理由拒绝。
    全国人民代表大会代表、北京市侨联副主席、北京天坛医院内科副主任、印度尼西亚归侨吴益修说，广大华侨一直和印度尼西亚人民共患难、同欢乐。我记得在日本占领印度尼西亚期间，有一个华侨亚弄（杂货）店店主，抱着一个患了天花的印度尼西亚小孩，到我的门诊所来诊治。这个华侨紧紧地偎抱着这个小孩，就像抱着自己的孩子一样。当我提醒他天花是很容易传染的，不要这样紧紧地抱住孩子时，他回答说：“不要紧。他是我的正在生病的朋友的孩子，无论如何你要给我挽救他。”在印度尼西亚人民抗击荷兰殖民主义者的斗争中，很多华侨青年拿起武器，和印度尼西亚朋友一起并肩作战。我们茂物的华侨和红十字会的工作人员，就曾冒着侵略军的炮火，英勇的抢救印度尼西亚革命军的伤兵。类似这样华侨和印度尼西亚人民患难与共的事例，在我侨居印度尼西亚期间，真是屡见不鲜。我始终这样认为，印度尼西亚广大人民对我们华侨是同情的、友好的。掀起排华、反华逆流的，仅是一小撮受帝国主义扶植、为帝国主义利益服务的反动分子。他们排斥朋友、勾结强盗，他们的排华、反华活动，日益引起了印度尼西亚善良人民和公正人士的不安和不满。吴益修说，陈外长的建议是完全符合中国人民和印度尼西亚人民的利益的，只是不利于帝国主义和印度尼西亚的一小撮反动派。我们希望印度尼西亚政府珍惜两国人民的友谊，立即接受陈外长的建议，停止排华，谈判处理华侨问题。
    全国人民代表大会代表、广东省侨联副主席、印度尼西亚归侨黄洁说，中国政府和人民对印度尼西亚一贯友好。当印度尼西亚经济困难时，中国人民伸出了友谊的手，在印度尼西亚平定叛乱的斗争中，中国政府和人民给予了坚决的支持和物质援助。印度尼西亚华侨与印度尼西亚人民更有着千百年的友谊，他们和当地人民共同努力，发展了印度尼西亚经济；在反对荷兰殖民主义和日本帝国主义的斗争中，华侨与印度尼西亚人民并肩作战，许多华侨甚至流尽了最后一滴鲜血。今年5月以来，印度尼西亚竟掀起了大规模的、全面的反华、排华逆流，华侨财产遭到了巨大损失，人身安全受到了严重侵害。与此同时，印度尼西亚某些报刊，为了在印度尼西亚人民中间煽动反华情绪，以配合其排华活动，大量散布攻击和诬蔑我国的言论，甚而公然侮辱中国人民敬爱的领袖。中国人民对这种以怨报德的极凶恶的极不友好的行为不能不表示万分的愤慨。黄洁说，华侨已不同于过去。过去他们是无依无靠的海外孤儿，他们为生计所迫，不得不忍屈受辱，过着寄人篱下的生活。但是，这种悲惨的情况，在中华人民共和国成立以后，早已一去不复返了。强大的社会主义祖国，一直在关怀着自己侨胞的命运。在祖国欣欣向荣的新时代，一切侨居国外的同胞，随时都可以回到祖国温暖的怀抱。
