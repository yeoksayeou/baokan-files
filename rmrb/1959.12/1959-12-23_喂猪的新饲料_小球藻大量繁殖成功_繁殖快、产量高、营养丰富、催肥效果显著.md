　　New Feed for Pigs
    Mass Propagation of Chlorella Achieved
    Fast Propagation, High Yield, Rich in Nutrients, and Remarkable Fattening Effect
    (Our Dispatch) A good feed for pigs—chlorella—has been successfully mass-propagated by the Wenzhou Prefecture Agricultural Science Research Institute in Zhejiang Province. In the past, the scientific community has conducted much research on the artificial cultivation of chlorella, but mass propagation is still a first attempt.
    Chlorella belongs to the single-celled green algae and is a lower plant. According to tests by the Wenzhou Prefecture Agricultural Science Research Institute, chlorella cells contain large amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrates, and various vitamins, and the nutritional content is better than barley, wheat bran, soybeans, white rice, and so on. This plant reproduces quickly, is easy to cultivate, and has a high yield. One mu of land can be harvested 27 to 30 times a year, and can produce about 10,000 jin of dry chlorella powder.
    Using chlorella as feed, the weight gain of pigs is very significant. Chlorella solution or dry powder mixed with green and coarse feed has a fragrant and slightly sweet taste, good palatability, and pigs like to eat it very much. According to tests, pigs weighing 100 jin, fed three jin of concentrated chlorella daily in green and coarse feed (70% water spinach, 30% vegetable leaves), gained an average of 0.95 jin per pig per day, almost double the daily weight gain of pigs fed only green feed. The results of a comparative test using chlorella with various refined feeds to feed pigs showed that each jin of concentrated chlorella has a fattening effect equivalent to two jin of fine bran or one and a half jin of wheat bran or two jin of soybean cake flour. The effect of feeding chlorella to dairy cows, rabbits, etc. is also good. Chlorella has a high nutritional value, so pigs do not need to eat a lot each time, and green and coarse feed is still needed to fill their stomachs in order to be full. At the same time, too much chlorella cannot be completely absorbed and utilized, and the effect is not good.
    Chlorella is widely distributed in nature and exists in large quantities in tropical and temperate fresh water, and grows even more luxuriantly in fresh water rich in organic matter, and also in soil. Its individual is spherical, only a few microns (one thousandth of a millimeter) in size, and three or four thousand chlorella connected together are less than one centimeter long. The internal structure of the individual can only be seen under a microscope of about 400 times. This type of single-celled green algae has no roots, stems, or leaves, and does not bloom or bear fruit, but contains chloroplasts, which can carry out photosynthesis, produce organic matter, and have high nutritional value. Because chlorella can fully absorb and utilize solar energy and has a fast reproduction rate, it can increase the number of individuals by 40 times in 24 hours in fresh water at 25 to 26 degrees Celsius; it can also grow in the range of 0 to 40 degrees Celsius, but the reproduction rate is a little weaker.
    The method of artificially cultivating chlorella is: select a clean large glass jar or pool, put in the culture solution, boil and filter the decomposed human manure and urine, take out 2%-3%, and mix it with an equal amount of chemical fertilizer made of ammonium sulfate, superphosphate of lime, magnesium sulfate, etc. to form a culture solution, then put the chlorella into the culture solution, add carbon dioxide twice a day, and stir with a stick to allow air to circulate. In the evening, you can also use electric lights to illuminate it to accelerate its growth. When the weather is warm, after three to four days, and when the weather is cold, ten to fifteen days, the culture solution will turn green; when the color turns dark green, let it precipitate, remove the clear water above, and the chlorella will be successfully cultivated.

### 喂猪的新饲料  小球藻大量繁殖成功  繁殖快、产量高、营养丰富、催肥效果显著

　　喂猪的新饲料
    小球藻大量繁殖成功
    繁殖快、产量高、营养丰富、催肥效果显著
    本报讯　喂猪的好饲料——小球藻，在浙江省温州专区农业科学研究所大量繁殖成功。过去，科学界在人工培养小球藻方面，曾经做过许多研究工作；而大量繁殖还是初次尝试。
    小球藻属于单细胞的绿藻类，是一种低等植物。据温州专区农业科学研究所化验结果，小球藻的细胞内含有大量蛋白质、脂肪、碳水化合物和多种维生素，营养成分比大麦、麸皮、大豆、白米等都好。这种植物繁殖很快，培养容易，产量很高，一亩田一年能收获二十七至三十次，可以生产小球藻干粉一万斤左右。
    用小球藻作饲料，猪的增重效果很显著。小球藻溶液或干粉同青粗饲料拌和在一起，味道香而带微甜，适口性好，猪很喜欢吃。根据试验证明，体重一百斤的猪，每天在青粗饲料（70％水苋菜、30％菜叶）中加喂三斤浓缩小球藻，每头猪平均日增重量零点九五斤，比光喂青饲料的猪，每日增重量几乎多一倍。用小球藻与各种精饲料喂猪对比试验结果：每一斤浓缩小球藻的催肥效果，相当于二斤细糠或一斤半麸皮或二斤豆饼粉的作用。用小球藻喂奶牛、兔子等，效果也好。小球藻营养价值很高，猪每次吃的量不要很多，还需用青粗饲料填充肠胃，才能吃饱。同时，小球藻喂得太多，不能完全被吸收利用，效果也不好。
    小球藻在自然界里分布很广，在热带和温带的淡水中都大量存在，在有机物质丰富的淡水中生长更是繁盛，土壤中也有。它的个体呈圆球形，只有几个微米（千分之一毫米）大小，三千或四千个小球藻连接起来还不到一厘米，在四百倍左右的显微镜下才能看到个体内部的结构。这类单细胞绿藻没有根和茎叶，也不开花结果，但含有叶绿素的色素体，能进行光合作用，能制造有机物，有很高的营养价值。小球藻由于能充分吸收和利用太阳能，繁殖速度快，在摄氏二十五至二十六度的淡水中，一昼夜可增加个体数四十倍；在摄氏零度至四十度范围内也能生长，只是繁殖力弱一点。
    人工培养小球藻的方法是：选一个干净的大玻璃缸或水池，放入培养液，把腐熟的人粪尿煮沸、过滤，取出2％—3％，同份量相等的、由硫酸铵、过磷酸石灰、硫酸镁等配制而成的化肥拌和在一起，即成培养液，然后把小球藻放入培养液内，每天加入二氧化碳两次，同时用棍棒搅拌，使空气流通，晚上还可用电灯照明促使它加速生长。天暖时经过三天到四天，天冷时十天到十五天，培养液即呈现绿色；待颜色变成深绿时，使其沉淀，除去上面的清水，小球藻就培养成功了。
