Prague, December 21st (By our reporter Yang Yi) – Winter snow covers the fields and streets of Czechoslovakia, and the festively decorated shop windows herald the approach of the New Year. Even further ahead of schedule are the avalanche of triumphant reports from various regions announcing the early completion of their annual production plans since mid-November.

Thanks to the further development of the socialist labor competition, especially the widespread campaign to win the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team," the labor enthusiasm of the Czechoslovak people has greatly increased this year, and many industrial and mining enterprises have completed their production tasks ahead of schedule and in excess of quotas.

The miners of Czechoslovakia, who enjoy high honor, are still at the forefront of their fellow workers. The famous Kladno mining area has fully completed its annual plan. The Stalin Mine in Ostrava, the center of coal and steel, completed its annual target on November 20th due to good production organization. So far, four large coal mines in the Ostrava-Karvina mining area have completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule.

The machine manufacturing industry, known as the industrial heart of Czechoslovakia, and other enterprises have closely followed suit. In the Prague region alone, more than sixty factories have already completed their annual plans.

The farmers of Czechoslovakia have also shown the same high political enthusiasm as the working class. As of December 17th, all villages in the three states of Prague, Pilsen, and České Budějovice had achieved electrification more than a year ahead of schedule. This year, the national procurement task for poultry and eggs has been completed ahead of schedule, with the Slovak region alone selling 20 million more eggs than planned. Slovakia has also completed its milk procurement plan, delivering 61.1 million liters of milk to the state than last year.

One of the reasons why the Czechoslovak people are actively completing this year's production plan is to better welcome next year—the final year of the Second Five-Year Plan. They are determined to successfully realize and further improve the targets of the 1960 plan to create prerequisites for the socialist construction of the Third Five-Year Plan.

Since the reorganization of the Czechoslovak national economic plan began this year, the working people have gained more opportunities to participate in the preparation and discussion of the 1960 plan. They not only guarantee the completion of the tasks stipulated by the state, but also try every means to tap potential, improve the original targets, and show unprecedented initiative and creativity. Since August this year, a climax of heated discussions on next year's plan has been set off in all factories, workshops, and teams in Czechoslovakia. Employees have put forward tens of thousands of innovative suggestions, especially rationalization proposals on utilizing advanced technology, improving production organization, reducing production costs, saving raw materials, and improving labor productivity. According to preliminary statistics, due to the proposal and adoption of these suggestions, the production plans of various factories in Czechoslovakia next year will exceed the original targets by about 2 billion crowns.

After discussion, the workers of the Kosice Iron Mine in eastern Slovakia proposed that the total output value for next year should be increased from the original 2.5% to 4%, and labor productivity should be increased from the original 2.6% to 7%.

The employees of the world-famous Pilsen Lenin Factory have also invested in the movement to improve next year's targets. On average, every hundred workers put forward seven rationalization proposals, saving a value of 44,000 crowns. The factory established sixty-five comprehensive technical teams to explore various possibilities for improving production methods, organization, and design. After research and discussion, the Lenin Factory is preparing to revise the original target of increasing labor productivity by 8.5% in 1960 to 9%, and save more than 8,000 tons of raw materials.

The preparations and discussions of the working people regarding next year's plan have been successfully concluded. More and more industrial and mining enterprises have passed the final step of 1959 and are welcoming the arrival of 1960 with full confidence, which is of great significance for the completion of Czechoslovakia's socialist construction.

Bucharest, December 21st (By our reporter Wei Lingbing) – Although 1960 has not yet arrived, Romanian workers have already produced tens of thousands of tons of steel, coal, and a large number of other products for next year, creating a good starting point for completing and overfulfilling next year's production plan. So far, more than half of the industrial and mining enterprises in Romania have completed this year's production plans ahead of schedule and have begun working for 1960.

The Central Plenary Session of the Romanian Workers' Party held in December this year decided to develop the national industry at a faster rate. This inspiring call has brought the production competition movement on the industrial front to a new climax. Now, triumphant reports of batches of industrial and mining enterprises issuing early completion of this year's production plans are coming in every day.

After more than eleven months of enthusiastic competition, the national steel workers have completed this year's task of producing 1.3 million tons of steel sixteen days ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota by 30,000 tons. The metallurgical workers of the Resita United Factory completed their annual production plan twenty-one days ahead of schedule. By December 12th, they had overproduced 62,000 tons of steel, iron, and steel products. In the machine manufacturing and transportation equipment industries, many units have completed this year's production plans ahead of schedule. The "Ernst Thälmann" Tractor Factory completed its annual task of producing 9,000 tractors more than a month ahead of schedule. This year, the factory will overproduce 1,000 tractors. The "May 1st" Shipyard has built fifty-nine ships of various types this year, completing this year's commodity production plan ahead of schedule. Thanks to the widespread adoption of advanced technology, the national oil drilling workers completed this year's drilling task in early December.

The national cotton textile industry has now also completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule. Textile workers will overproduce 1,000 tons of cotton yarn and 4.5 million square meters of cotton fabrics this year.

Many industrial and mining enterprises have also completed their savings plans while completing their production plans. The national enterprise savings plan of 1 billion lei this year has been completed two months ahead of schedule, and by the end of the year, it is estimated that a total of 1.5 billion lei can be saved.

Under the inspiration of the 1960 national plan, many factories and enterprises are discussing how to complete and overfulfill next year's production plan at the fastest speed. The Resita United Factory faces the huge task of increasing steel production by 60%, iron by 18%, and steel products by 26% next year compared to this year. In order to complete this task, a special committee including excellent engineers and advanced workers has been formed. The committee discussed specific measures to improve equipment utilization, improve labor organization, and improve technical level with the worker masses. The workers are full of confidence in completing next year's production plan.

　　提前完成今年计划　作好明年生产准备
    捷罗大批企业争取明年胜过今年
    本报布拉格21日电　记者杨翊报道，冬雪复盖着捷克斯洛伐克的原野和街道，节日盛装的商店橱窗预示着新年的临近，而走在时间更前面的，是从11月中旬起就雪片般飞来的各地提前完成全年生产计划的捷报。
    捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民今年由于进一步开展社会主义劳动竞赛，特别是广泛开展争取“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的运动，劳动热情大大高涨，许多工矿企业都提前超额实现了自己的生产任务。
    在捷克斯洛伐克享有崇高荣誉的矿工们这次仍然走在其他劳动伙伴们的前列。著名的克拉德诺矿区已全部完成年度计划。煤钢中心俄斯特拉发的斯大林煤矿由于生产组织得好，在11月20日就完成了全年指标。到目前为止，在俄斯特拉发—卡尔维那矿区已有四个大煤矿提前完成了年度生产任务。
    号称捷克斯洛伐克工业心脏的机器制造业和其他企业也紧紧相随，仅布拉格州就有六十多个工厂 已经完成了全年计划。
    捷克斯洛伐克的农民们也显示了与工人阶级同样高昂的政治热情，到12月17日止，布拉格、比尔森和布吉约维泽三州的所有村庄都提前一年多实现了电气化。今年全国家禽和鸡蛋的收购任务已提前完成，单是斯洛伐克地区就超额出售了二千万个鸡蛋。斯洛伐克还已完成牛奶的收购计划，比去年多交给国家六千一百万公升牛奶。
    捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民积极完成今年生产计划的原因之一，是为了更好地迎接明年——第二个五年计划最后一年的宏伟任务。他们决心胜利实现和进一步提高1960年计划的指标，来为建成社会主义的第三个五年计划创造前提。
    由于捷克斯洛伐克国民经济计划改组从今年开始付诸实行，劳动人民获得了更多参与1960年计划准备和讨论的机会。他们不仅保证完成国家规定的任务，而且千方百计挖潜力，提高原订指标，显示了前所未有的积极性和创造性。从今年8月以来，捷克斯洛伐克所有工厂、车间、小组都掀起了热烈讨论明年计划的高潮，职工们提出了成千上万条革新的建议，特别是关于利用先进技术，改善生产组织，降低生产成本，节约原材料和提高劳动生产率的合理化建议。据初步统计，由于这些建议的提出和采用，捷克斯洛伐克明年各个工厂的生产计划将超出原订指标约二十亿克朗。
    斯洛伐克东部科息斯铁矿在讨论后，工人们提出明年总产值应由原订的提高2.5％改为4％，劳动生产率由原订的提高2.6％增至7％。
    世界闻名的比尔森列宁工厂的职工们也都投入了提高明年指标的运动中，平均每一百个工人就提出了七件合理化建议，节约价值达四万四千克朗。全厂成立了六十五个综合技术小组，探寻改进生产方法，组织和设计等各种可能性。经过研究和讨论，列宁工厂准备把原订1960年提高劳动生产率8.5％的指标改订为9％，并节约原材料八千吨以上。
    劳动人民关于明年计划的准备和讨论已胜利结束，越来越多的工矿企业迈过了1959年的最后一步，正以充沛的信心迎接对完成捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设具有重大意义的1960年的来临。
    本报布加勒斯特21日电　记者魏凌冰报道：1960年虽然还没有来到，但是罗马尼亚工人已经为明年生产了成万吨的钢铁、煤炭和大量的其他产品，为完成和超额完成明年的生产计划创造了良好的起点。到目前为止，罗马尼亚全国半数以上的工矿企业已经提前完成了今年的生产计划，开始为1960年而工作。
    罗马尼亚工人党今年12月举行的中央全会决定以更快的速度发展国家工业，这个鼓舞人心的号召使工业战线上的生产竞赛运动达到了新的高潮。现在每天都传来成批的工矿企业发出提前完成今年生产计划的捷报。
    全国炼钢工人经过十一个多月的热烈竞赛，已经提前十六天，超额三万吨完成了今年生产一百三十万吨钢的任务。累希擦联合工厂的冶金工人提前二十一天完成了全年生产计划，他们到12月12日已经超计划生产了六万二千吨钢、铁和钢材。在机器制造和交通运输工具工业部门中，有许多单位提前完成了今年的生产计划。“恩斯特·台尔曼”拖拉机制造厂提前一个多月完成了全年生产九千台拖拉机的任务。今年内，这个工厂将超计划生产一千台拖拉机。“五一”造船厂今年已经建造了五十九只各型船只，提前完成了今年的商品生产计划。全国石油钻井工人由于普遍采用了先进技术，在12月初就完成了今年的钻井任务。
    全国棉纺工业现在也提前完成了今年的生产计划。纺织工人在今年将超计划生产一千吨棉纱和四百五十万平方米的棉织品。
    许多工矿企业在完成生产计划的同时也完成了节约计划。今年全国企业节约十亿列伊的计划已经提前两个月完成，到年底大约共计能节约十五亿列伊。
    在1960年国家计划的鼓舞下，许多工厂企业都在讨论怎样才能用最快的速度完成和超额完成明年的生产计划。累希擦联合工厂面临着在明年使钢产量比今年增长60％、铁增长18％、钢材增长26％的巨大任务。为了完成这个任务，组成了一个包括优秀工程师和先进工人的专门委员会。委员会同工人群众一起讨论了提高设备利用率、改进劳动组织和提高技术水平的具体措施。工人们对完成明年生产计划满怀信心。
