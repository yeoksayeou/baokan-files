    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 2nd: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag" said today that the eighth national unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," held by the Japanese people on November 27th, far surpassed the previous seven unified actions in scope and depth. It marks the starting point of a greater upsurge in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty."
    This is the evaluation made by "Red Flag" after a comprehensive survey based on reports from its local reporters on this nationwide movement.
    "Red Flag" said that one of the characteristics of the eighth unified action is the participation of farmers in the struggle. They held rallies against the "Security Treaty" in Tokyo and two other prefectures together with urban workers.
    Another characteristic is that people from other social strata also participated in this struggle in various ways. Two thousand five hundred women in Tokyo and one thousand five hundred women in Gunma Prefecture held demonstrations respectively. Leaders in cultural and intellectual circles held parades and lectures, calling on the public to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty." In many other regions, small and medium-sized merchants also participated in the unified action. While opposing the "Security Treaty," they also demanded tax cuts. Unemployed workers also went to local government agencies to demand that the government take more unemployment relief measures.
    "Red Flag" said that another characteristic of this struggle, compared with the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" last year, is that young people are playing an important role in the struggle in various places. Youth action teams of workers and peasants and joint struggle organizations of young students have been established in many prefectures.
    "Red Flag" said that the driving force behind the national unified action is the countless joint struggle organizations at the town, village, and factory levels. These grassroots activists hold lectures and study meetings every day, and their slogan is: Go deep into the masses to publicize and defeat the government's plan to revise the "Security Treaty."

    “赤旗报”评述第八次全国统一行动的特点
    反对“安全条约”斗争深入扩大
    据新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天说，日本人民在11月27日举行的反对修改日美“安全条约”第八次全国统一行动在范围和深度方面都远远超过了前七次统一行动。它标志着反对修改“安全条约”的斗争的更大高涨的起点。
    这是“赤旗报”根据它的地方记者的报道对这个全国性运动作了全面调查后所作的评价。
    “赤旗报”说，第八次统一行动的特点之一是农民参加了斗争。他们同城市工人一起在东京和其他两个县举行反对“安全条约”大会。
    另一特点是，其他各阶层人民也以各种方式参加了这次斗争。东京的二千五百名妇女和群马县的一千五百名妇女分别举行了示威，文化和知识界领袖们举行了游行、讲演会，呼吁公众反对修改“安全条约”。在另外许多地区，中小商人也参加了统一行动。他们在反对“安全条约”的同时，要求减税。失业工人们还到当地政府机关去，要求政府采取更多的失业救济措施。
    “赤旗报”说，同去年反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争比较，这次斗争的另一特点是，青年在各地的斗争中起着重要作用。许多县里成立了工农青年行动队和青年学生联合斗争组织。
    “赤旗报”说，给全国统一行动提供推动力量的是无数的镇、村和工厂一级的联合斗争组织。这些基层组织积极分子每天举行讲演和学习会议，他们的口号是：深入群众宣传，击败政府修改“安全条约”的计划。
