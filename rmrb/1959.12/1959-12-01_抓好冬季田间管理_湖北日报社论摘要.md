Grasp Winter Field Management Well
--Hubei Daily Editorial Abstract

Hubei Daily published an editorial entitled "Advance Triumphantly, Grasp Winter Management Well" on November 28. The abstract of the editorial is as follows:

Our province overcame the severe drought this year and won a great victory in autumn sowing. The sowing area of ​​the province exceeded the original plan and expanded compared to the actual sowing area last year.

At present, we must further strengthen field management. According to the production increase target, formulate strong management measures, and continuously carry out wheat seedling upgrading campaigns to ensure increased crop production and a bumper harvest.

However, not everyone is clear about this principle in their minds. Judging from the situation in various places, there are still some people who say, "This year is early, good, and successful, and a bumper harvest next year is no problem." Some say, "This year's good planting will yield half more, and the expanded area will yield half more, so management is not a big deal." These ideas are wrong. In order to achieve a continuous leap forward in agricultural production next year, in the cultivation of summer harvest crops, we must not only focus on staple foods, but also on miscellaneous grains; not only on grains, but also on rapeseed and other crops; not only on high-yield experimental fields, but also on large-scale balanced production increases. Only in this way can we achieve production increases everywhere and bumper harvests in everything. Only in this way can we start the first shot of a great agricultural harvest next year.

According to the above requirements, a special team should be established for the field management of autumn-sown crops, from leadership to labor arrangement, to ensure that 15% to 20% of the labor force is used for field management. In field management work, it is necessary to establish various professional teams based on the characteristics of this year's autumn sowing work, strengthen the responsibility system, and adopt a method that combines regular management by professional teams with concentrated efforts to grasp key links at certain periods to carry out field management work from beginning to end. In field management work, it is also necessary to use the leadership method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle. On the one hand, strengthen the leadership of high-yield experimental fields, set up examples, and carry out learning, comparing, catching up, and surpassing movements; on the other hand, continuously classify and rank crops, organize forces to eliminate third-class seedlings. Through visits, evaluations, and competitions, continuously improve first-class seedlings, eliminate third-class seedlings, and vigorously carry out wheat seedling upgrading campaigns to achieve backward catching up with advanced, and advanced becoming even more advanced.

In terms of field management measures, we must pay attention to grasping the key links. In a certain period, we must concentrate our main forces and focus on solving the main contradictions. From the current point of view, it is necessary to get through the winter safely. The requirements of this stage are mainly to ensure that the seedlings are complete and strong, and to promote the healthy development of wheat roots. To this end, we must solve four problems: first, continue to seize the opportunity to check seedlings and replant, to ensure complete seedlings; second, loosen the soil and topdress to promote seedling growth; third, apply fertilizer rationally to prevent excessive growth, frost damage, and lodging in the later stage; fourth, clear ditches and drain waterlogged areas, and pay attention to pest prevention. If these four tasks are done well, wheat can safely overwinter and grow well, which will be of great benefit to the next step of greening, rounding stalks, and jointing. The field management of other crops is roughly the same. In the field management of overwintering crops, topdressing is another key link. Too little fertilizer will make the seedlings yellow and thin, and their frost resistance will also be weak; too much fertilizer or improper application will also lead to excessive growth and greed for green, which will reduce yield. Therefore, we must conduct a comprehensive survey, classify and rank, apply fertilizer in stages according to the growth of crops, and apply fertilizer according to the seedlings. Apply fertilizer to weak seedlings first, strong seedlings later, distant land first, and nearby land later. Only in this way can we ensure the comprehensive and balanced development of crops and safely get through the winter. (Attached picture)

### 抓好冬季田间管理——湖北日报社论摘要

    抓好冬季田间管理
    ——湖北日报社论摘要
    11月28日，湖北日报以“乘胜前进，抓好冬管”为题发表社论。社论摘要如下：
  我省今年战胜了特大干旱，在秋种工作上又打了一个大胜仗。全省播种面积超过了原订计划，并比去年实播面积扩大了。
    目前，必须进一步加强田间管理工作。根据增产的指标，制定有力的管理措施，连续不断地开展麦苗升级运动，以确保作物增产丰收。
    可是并不是所有的人思想上都明确这个道理。从各地情况来看，还有这样一部分人，他们说：“今年是一早三好，明年丰收不成问题了。”有的说：“今年种的好要多收一半，面积扩大要多收一半，管不管问题不大。”这些想法是错误的。为了实现明年农业生产的持续跃进，在对夏收作物培育方面，不仅要抓主粮，还要抓杂粮；不仅要抓粮食，还要抓油菜和其他作物；不仅要抓高额丰产试验，还要抓大面积平衡增产。只有这样，才能达到块块增产，样样丰收。只有这样，才能打响明年农业大丰收的头一炮。
    根据以上要求，在秋种作物田间管理上，从领导力量到劳力的安排都应建立起一套专门班子，保证有15％到20％的劳动力用于田间管理。在田间管理工作中，要根据今年秋种工作的特点，建立各种专业队，加强责任制，并且采取专业队经常管理与一定时期抓住主要环节组织突击相结合的办法，把田间管理工作一贯到底。在田间管理工作中，还要运用抓两头带中间的领导方法，一方面加强对高产试验田的领导，树立榜样，开展学、比、赶、超运动；另一方面要不断地把作物进行分类排队，组织力量突击消灭三类苗。通过参观、评比，开展竞赛，不断地提高一类苗，消灭三类苗，大搞麦苗升级运动，达到落后赶先进，先进更先进。
    在田间管理的措施上，一定要注意抓环节。在一定时期要集中主要力量，突出解决主要的矛盾。从当前来说，就是要过好越冬关。这一阶段的要求，主要是苗全苗壮，促使小麦根系发育健全。为此就要解决好四个问题：第一是继续抓紧时机，查苗补苗，保证全苗；第二是松土、追肥，提苗壮苗；第三是合理追肥，防止陡长、冻害和后期倒伏；第四是清沟排渍，注意防虫。这四个工作，抓得好，小麦就可以安全过冬，生长良好，对下一步的返青、圆秆、拔节有很大的好处。其他作物的田间管理，也大致如此。在越冬作物的田间管理中，追肥又是一个主要的环节。肥过少，禾苗就会黄瘦，抗冻力也弱；肥过多或施用不当，也会出现陡长贪青现象，都会造成降低产量。因此一定要全面摸底，分类排队，根据作物生长情况，分期施肥，看苗追肥，瘦苗先追，壮苗后追，远地先追，近地后追。这样才能够保证作物全面平衡发展，安全度过冬天。（附图片）
