Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 3rd -- U.S. President Eisenhower, at a press conference on the 2nd before his departure for visits abroad, admitted that U.S. foreign policy is widely doubted abroad and that U.S. influence abroad is declining, when talking about his "mission" to visit some countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and Western Europe.

Eisenhower said, "From all the messages that come to us from abroad, we can conclude that many people, including our friends, allies, and other friends, still have many doubts in their minds about the true sincerity of the United States in seeking peace." He said that the United States "has tried in every possible way, through diplomatic contacts, through the speeches of the Secretary of State, myself, and others, to emphasize this point, but it seems that this has not been entirely successful."

Eisenhower indicated that one of the purposes of his foreign visits is to continue peddling the platitudes of false peace and to carry out the work that was "not entirely successful" before. He said that he "wants to prove (the U.S.) is not aggressive" and to convince people that "we (the U.S.) do not want anyone's territory or possessions."

A reporter also asked Eisenhower how the U.S. government would handle future military budgets, considering the development of missile weapons. In his answer, Eisenhower implicitly admitted that the U.S. would still be lagging behind in missile weapons in two, three, or four years. He emphasized that what the U.S. government "is doing" is "must maintain a huge strategic capability in manned aircraft, while spending more and more on missile development" to maintain the so-called "deterrent force." He said that the United States wants to "shift from one defense system to another." He also said that the U.S. is now "still conducting a larger and very definite research and development (new weapons) program."

Eisenhower, in talking about his visit to India, said that he would be "happy to discuss (the Sino-Indian border) issue" during his visit to India. He said, "In this regard, there is a question: As far as I know, I don't think this issue is exactly at the McMahon Line. I don't think anyone has ever known for sure." Eisenhower slandered China for adopting an approach of "joining in with force" on the Sino-Indian border issue.

When talking about the U.S. government's budget problems, Eisenhower admitted that the decrease in budget revenue has made the U.S. government's prospects for achieving a balanced budget this year very unstable. He pointed out that the huge U.S. national debt puts enormous pressure on the U.S. government. He said that the U.S. Treasury now pays more money annually in interest on the national debt alone than the entire budget expenditure of the U.S. government in 1940 (nine billion U.S. dollars). He admitted that this interest is a "burden" and a "threat" to the stability of the U.S. dollar.

Talking about the Panama Canal issue, Eisenhower tried to obliterate Panama's sovereignty over the Canal Zone and attempted to deal with Panama's sovereign demands for its own territory by using the deceptive method of giving Panama "nominal sovereignty" over the Canal Zone. Eisenhower's words fully illustrate how much value there is in his proclaimed statement that the U.S. "does not want anyone's territory or possessions."

    艾森豪威尔承认美国影响不断下降
    出国访问目的是继续兜售假和平货色
    并强调将付出更大费用发展导弹维持战略能力
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔2日在出国访问前夕举行的记者招待会上，谈到他将访问西亚、北非和西欧一些国家的“使命”时承认，美国的外交政策在国外受到普遍怀疑，美国在国外的影响不断下降。
    艾森豪威尔说，“从国外传到我们这里的所有消息中，我们可以得出这样的结论：许多人，其中包括我们的朋友、盟国和其他朋友的心里对美国在谋求和平方面的真正诚意仍然有许多怀疑”。他说，美国“已经试图以一切可能的方式，通过外交接触，通过国务卿、我本人以及其他人的演说来强调这一点，看来这似乎没有完全成功”。
    艾森豪威尔表示，他出国访问的目的之一就是要继续兜售假和平的滥调，进行以前“没有完全成功”的工作。他说，他“要证明（美国）不是侵略的”，让人们相信“我们（美国）不想得到任何人的领土或者所有物。”
    还有记者问艾森豪威尔，考虑到导弹武器的发展，美国政府将怎样处理今后的军事预算。艾森豪威尔在回答时默认美国在两年、三年或四年内在导弹武器方面仍将处在落后状态，他强调说，美国政府“正在做的”是“必须在有人驾驶的飞机方面维持巨大的战略能力，同时在发展导弹方面付出越来越大的费用”，以维持所谓“威慑力量”。他说，美国要“从一个防御体系转移到另一个防御体系”。他还说，美国现在“还在进行一个更大的非常肯定的研究和发展（新武器）计划”。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到他对印度的访问时表示他在访问印度期间将
  “乐于讨论（中印边界）这个问题”。他说，“在这方面，有这样一个问题：就我所知，我认为这个问题并不正好在麦克马洪线那个地方。我认为从来没有人知道得很确切。”艾森豪威尔诬蔑中国对中印边界问题采取“以武力参加进去”的方针。
    谈到美国政府的预算问题时，艾森豪威尔承认，预算收入的减少使美国政府在今年取得预算平衡的前景很不稳定。他指出，美国庞大的国债给美国政府造成巨大压力。他说，仅仅是国债利息一项，美国国库现在每年付出的钱就超过了1940年美国政府整个预算开支（九十亿美元）。他承认，这种利息对美元的稳定是一种“负担”和“威胁”。
    谈到巴拿马运河问题，艾森豪威尔力图抹杀巴拿马对运河地区的主权，并且企图用给巴拿马对运河区的“名义上的主权”这种欺骗办法来对付巴拿马对自己领土的主权要求。艾森豪威尔这些话充分地说明，他宣扬的所谓美国“不想得到任何人的领土或所有物”到底有多大价值。
