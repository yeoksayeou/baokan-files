Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd, Tokyo dispatch: Two thousand Japanese workers, students, and citizens held a rally in Tokyo on the evening of the 22nd to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty." This meeting was convened by the Central Committee and the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the Japanese Communist Party as part of the tenth national unified action against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　Japanese Communist Party Chairman Nosaka Sanzō said that the meeting was very successful. He pointed out that many similar gatherings were also being held simultaneously throughout the country.

　　Nosaka Sanzō exposed that the essence of the planned revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" is to strengthen the military alliance with the United States and to target China and the Soviet Union as imaginary enemies.

　　He emphasized that efforts must be made to isolate the American imperialists and Kishi Nobusuke among the broad masses of the people, to organize a national democratic united front, and to advance towards the goal of establishing a people's government.

　　Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji delivered a speech saying that the success of this meeting proved that the masses of the people are uniting around the Party. He pointed out that more than eight hundred local joint struggle conferences to prevent the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" have been established so far. He asked the participants in the meeting to help organize more joint struggle conferences at all levels, so that joint struggle organizations would be spread throughout Japan. Miyamoto Kenji said that the Japanese people will surely win in this just struggle. Miyamoto Kenji suggested that, before Kishi Nobusuke leaves for the United States to sign the new US-Japan "Security Treaty," demonstrations and rallies should be held on a scale exceeding the "May Day" parade. He also suggested that, in order to oppose the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," a signature campaign like the one conducted by the Japanese people to demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons should be organized. He said that this is a way to fully exert the infinite power of the masses.

　　Miyamoto Kenji also said that the people's struggle against the military and political system maintained by the "Security Treaty" should be promoted.

　　Yanagimoto Yoshio, the person in charge of the political department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sōhyō"), said that "Sōhyō" will launch large-scale mass rallies on the day Kishi Nobusuke leaves for the United States and before that, to express the people's opposition to the signing of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." He added that if the power of the people fails to prevent Kishi Nobusuke from visiting the United States, another mass rally will be held on the day the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" is signed to oppose the ratification of this treaty.

　　Miyano Hara Sadamitsu, Secretary-General of the Japan Teachers' Union, stated that his union is determined to participate in the movement to organize many joint struggle conferences throughout the country to oppose the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　Kazami Akira, Chairman of the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations with China, emphasized that even if Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty" succeeds, it will be like a scrap of paper because the treaty is opposed by the vast majority of the people.

　　Hirano Yoshitaro, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, said that compared with the strength shown in the struggle against the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," the strength of the people's struggle against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" has greatly increased.

　　Kushida Fuki, President of the All-Japan Federation of Women's Organizations, said that a women's rally against Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States will be held on January 12.

　　The conference passed three resolutions and two appeals. The three resolutions are: a resolution on opposing Kishi Nobusuke's planned visit to the United States, a resolution on opposing attempts to formulate laws prohibiting demonstrations near the Diet and protesting against government repression of the movement against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and a resolution protesting to the US government. One appeal is a call for the Japanese people to rise up against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and the other is an appeal to the peace-loving and democratic people of Asian countries.

　　After the meeting, the participants held a lantern parade, with Nosaka Sanzō and Miyamoto Kenji walking at the forefront. (Attached picture)

　　迫使美日反动派在群众中孤立起来
    日共召开反对修改日美“安全条约”群众大会
    野坂参三号召组织全国民族民主统一阵线
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：两千名日本工人、学生和市民22日晚上在东京举行大会，反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”。这次大会是日本共产党中央委员会和东京都委员会召开的，作为反对修改日美“安全条约”第十次全国统一行动的一部分。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三说，这次会议开得非常成功。他指出，在全国各地同时也在举行着许多类似的集会。
    野坂参三揭露，计划修改日美“安全条约”的实质是加强同美国的军事联盟和以中国和苏联为假想敌。
    他强调指出，必须努力使美帝国主义者和岸信介在广大人民群众中孤立起来，组织全国民族民主统一阵线和向成立人民政府的目标前进。
    日本共产党总书记宫本显治发表演说说，这次大会的成功证明，人民群众正在团结在党的周围。他指出，到目前为止已经成立了八百多个阻止修改日美“安全条约”的地方性的共同斗争会议。他要求参加大会的人帮助在各级组织更多的共同斗争会议，以使日本各地遍布共同斗争组织。宫本显治说，日本人民必将在这场正义的斗争中获得胜利。宫本显治建议，在岸信介动身前往美国去签署新的日美“安全条约”之前，举行规模超过“五一”节游行的游行示威和集会。他还建议，为了反对修改日美“安全条约”，应当组织像日本人民为要求禁止核武器而进行的那种征集签名运动。他说，这是充分发挥群众无穷尽的力量的办法。
    宫本显治还说，应当促进人民反对“安全条约”所保持的军事体制和政治体制的斗争。
    日本工会总评议会（“总评”）政治部负责人柳本美雄说，“总评”将在岸信介动身去美国的这一天以及在这以前发起大规模的群众大会，以表示人民反对签署新的日美“安全条约”。他又说，如果人民的力量没有能够阻止岸信介访美，那么将在新的日美“安全条约”签字之日举行另一次群众大会来反对批准这个条约。
    日本教职员工会书记长宫之原贞光表示，他的工会决心参加在全国各地组织许多共同斗争会议的运动，来反对修改日美“安全条约”。
    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章着重指出，即使岸信介修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋得逞，可是由于这个条约遭到绝大多数人民的反对，它将形同废纸。
    日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎说，同反对“警察官职务执行法”斗争中所显示的力量相比，人民反对修改日美“安全条约”斗争的力量已经有很大增长。
    全日本妇女团体联合会会长栉田蕗说，反对岸信介访美的妇女大会将在1月12日举行。
    大会通过了三个决议和两份呼吁书。这三个决议是：关于反对岸信介计划访问美国的决议，关于反对企图制订禁止在国会附近游行的法律和抗议政府对反对修改日美“安全条约”运动采取镇压措施的决议以及向美国政府抗议的决议。一份呼吁书是号召日本人民起来反对修改日美“安全条约”，另一份呼吁书是给爱好和平和民主的亚洲各国人民的。
    会后，大会的参加者举行了提灯游行，野坂参三和宫本显治走在最前列。（附图片）
