Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: The Beijing Illiteracy Elimination Association, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Municipal Women's Federation recently jointly held a conference of representatives of advanced units in illiteracy elimination and spare-time education in the suburbs of Beijing, awarded prizes to advanced units in illiteracy elimination and spare-time education, and exchanged experiences in persevering in spare-time education throughout the year at the meeting.

Forty-five units were awarded at the meeting. Their common experience in carrying out spare-time education is to strengthen the leadership of the Party and launch mass movements on a large scale. The Party branch secretary of the Qian Shimen Village Production Team of the Changgou People's Commune in Zhoukoudian District, who has persisted in spare-time education for five years, personally took charge, frequently grasped spare-time cultural learning, and mobilized various departments and production organizations to "be responsible at all levels and manage by special personnel." When dispatching labor organizations in production brigades and production teams, they paid attention to matching teachers and arranging study time to ensure that they managed production and also managed learning. They also obtained the close cooperation of relevant departments such as the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation to jointly do a good job in spare-time education. In this way, the leadership is concretely strong, and spare-time education work is regular and lasting. In order to strengthen leadership, the Beitunfa Production Brigade of the Panggezhuang People's Commune in Daxing District formed a general school department of the cultural and technical spare-time school under the unified leadership of the Party general branch, composed of administrative, Communist Youth League, Women's Federation and other relevant departments, and established branch schools with villages as units. The secretary of the Party general branch served as the principal of the general school, the secretary of the branch served as the principal of the branch school, and the deputy captain of production served as the learning captain, forming a leadership network from top to bottom. A full-time director of teaching affairs was set up in the general school, and a group of civil school teachers was established in each production team, forming a teacher network. This form of organization and leadership not only embodies the combination of leadership and the masses in the people's communes, but also effectively ensures that everyone is in charge of every aspect, and every block is managed by someone. The masses praised this measure, saying: "Two networks plus one school, the more it is run, the more reliable it becomes." In adhering to year-round spare-time learning, they also adopted the form of mass movements such as teaching (propagating the Party's guidelines and policies, improving understanding), debating (voicing opinions and debating, unifying thinking), watching (introducing advanced experiences, grasping typical examples, organizing visits), and leading (grasping the advanced to lead the backward, cadres taking the lead, carrying out inspections and evaluations), and always paid attention to overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking and continuously consolidating and improving the masses' enthusiasm for learning.

The Miyun County Detachment of the Miyun Reservoir introduced the experience of migrant workers in persisting in year-round learning. They used the favorable conditions of migrant workers' concentrated production to launch mass movements on a large scale. They took the basic-level production organization as the unit, with Party members and League members as the backbone, and with the action slogans of "no delay in production and learning, and double harvest of technology and culture" and "throw the illiteracy hat on the construction site," they set off a vigorous learning movement. Youth migrant worker Tong Zengnian, who was rated as an excellent advanced producer five times, only knew four hundred characters when he first arrived at the construction site. After working hard, he has now recognized one thousand five hundred characters, can write letters, read newspapers, and also serves as an illiteracy elimination teacher. Many people take him as a learning model, using soil as paper, sticks as pens, large stone slabs as blackboards, and seize every opportunity to learn anytime and anywhere. People who know more characters automatically "take apprentices." Now more than six hundred and seventy people have entered the spare-time primary school class for learning.

Learning more in slack time, learning less in busy time, learning flexibly in extremely busy time, delivering culture to the mountains, fields, and canal construction sites, and "contracting teaching and learning" are also the common experiences of various advanced units. The meeting also introduced experiences in combining production, adopting flexible and diverse teaching methods, and cultivating and improving spare-time teachers.

At the meeting, reports were also heard from Deng Tuo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Dong Chuncai, Vice Minister of Education, and Zhao Fan, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee. Finally, a letter of proposal on actively carrying out illiteracy elimination and spare-time education work this winter and next spring was adopted by the forty-five advanced units.

    领导具体有力　业余学习经常
    北京郊区扫盲和业余教育先进单位代表交流经验
    据新华社3日讯　北京市扫盲协会、市教育局、共青团北京市委、市妇女联合会在最近联合举行了郊区扫盲、业余教育先进单位代表会，奖励了扫除文盲和业余教育的先进单位，并在会上交流了常年坚持业余教育的经验。
    会上受奖的有四十五个单位，他们开展业余教育的共同经验是加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。已经坚持了五年业余教育的周口店区长沟人民公社前石门村生产队的党支部书记，亲自挂帅，经常抓业余文化学习，并发动各部门和各生产组织“层层负责，专人管理”，在生产大队和生产小队调派劳动组织时，都注意搭配教师，安排学习时间，作到管生产也管学习；还取得共青团、妇联等有关部门的密切配合，共同做好业余教育工作。这样就使领导具体有力，业余教育工作经常持久。大兴区庞各庄人民公社北顿垡生产大队，为了加强领导，在党总支统一领导下，由行政、共青团、妇联等有关部门，组成了文化技术业余学校总校部，以村为单位建立了分校，总校由党总支书记任校长、支部书记任分校长，生产副队长任学习队长，从上到下形成一套领导网；又在总校设专职教导主任，各生产小队建立民校教师小组，组成了教师网。这种组织领导形式，在人民公社中不仅体现了领导与群众相结合，而且切实作到条条有人抓，块块有人管，群众赞扬这种措施说：“两网加一校，越办越牢靠”。在坚持常年业余学习中，他们还采取教（宣传党的方针、政策、提高认识）、辩（鸣放辩论，统一思想）、看（介绍先进经验，抓典型、组织参观）、带（抓先进带落后，干部带头，开展检查评比）等群众运动的形式，随时注意克服右倾保守思想，不断巩固和提高群众的学习热情。
    密云水库密云县支队介绍了民工坚持常年学习的经验。他们利用民工集中生产的有利条件，大搞群众运动。他们以生产的基层组织为单位，以党员、团员为骨干，又以“生产、学习两不误，技术文化双丰收”和“把文盲帽子扔在工地上”为行动口号，掀起了轰轰烈烈的学习运动。五次被评为甲等先进生产者的青年民工佟增年，初到工地时只认识四百字，经过埋头苦学，现在已经识了一千五百字，能写信、会看报，还兼任了扫盲教师。许多人把他作为学习榜样，以土当纸、棍当笔、大石片当黑板、随时随地抓紧一切机会学习，识字多的人自动“带徒弟”，现在已有六百七十多人进入业余小学班学习。
    闲时多学、忙时少学、大忙机动学，把文化送上山、送到田、送到修渠工地间“包教包学”，也是各个先进单位的共同经验。会上对结合生产、采用灵活多样的教学方式，以及培养提高业余师资等问题的经验也作了介绍。
    会上，还听了中共北京市委书记处书记邓拓、教育部副部长董纯才和市委农村工作部部长赵凡的报告。最后并通过了四十五个先进单位关于今冬明春积极开展扫盲和业余教育工作的倡议书。（附图片）
