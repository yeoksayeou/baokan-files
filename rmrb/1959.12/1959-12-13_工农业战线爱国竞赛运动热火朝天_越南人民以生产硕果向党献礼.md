Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 12th: Our correspondent reports: The patriotic emulation drive launched by the people of North Vietnam to welcome the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Labor Party is currently advancing with irresistible force. From the mountains to the plains, from the Sino-Vietnamese border to the military demarcation line, the slogan "Present gifts to the Party" resounds everywhere. The broad masses of workers, cadres, and cooperative members are determined to race against time to fulfill and overfulfill the state production plan.

    On the industrial front, 81 enterprises and construction sites under the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Construction, and the Ministry of Transportation and Posts and Telecommunications in the entire North have already completed or overfulfilled their annual production plans for this year ahead of schedule. Some large enterprises, such as the Haiphong Cement Plant, the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, and the Hong Gai and Cam Pha coal mines, have made great progress in production since the start of the competition. The Haiphong Cement Plant produced more than 2,000 tons of cement in November than originally planned, and the Nam Dinh Textile Factory overproduced more than 655,000 meters of cloth in November. The Hanoi Machine Factory, Vietnam's largest machine manufacturing plant, completed its annual production plan one month and two days ahead of schedule.

    On the agricultural front, encouraged by this year's unprecedented bumper harvest, the broad masses of peasants are further developing the winter-spring production movement. At present, the movement to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, and vigorously reform agricultural implements is more enthusiastic than in previous years and has achieved remarkable results. So far, Phu Tho Province has excavated more than 120,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, which can guarantee irrigation water for 4,680 hectares of cultivated land. The Vinh Linh area, which has basically realized collectivization, now averages 10 to 15 tons of fertilizer accumulated per agricultural cooperative every day, which has never happened before. In order to plow deeper, agricultural cooperatives in many provinces have modified old plows into the "Type 58" walking plow.

    The "Patriotic Emulation Movement" is not only developing rapidly on the industrial and agricultural production fronts, but is also being carried out enthusiastically in the army, government agencies, schools, hospitals, and joint state-private enterprises. For example, some schools have put forward the demand of "teachers teach well, students learn well," and some post offices have put forward the slogan of "service to the people." Through the competition, the spirit of mutual assistance and love among comrades has been greatly promoted, and work efficiency has been significantly improved.

    In order to present gifts to the Party, regardless of whether they are old people, young people, women, or children, all are showing their talents and creating outstanding achievements with their practical actions. Young people are a strong shock force in the competition. The Communist Youth League members and young workers of the Cam Pha Coal Mine have formed various shock teams to undertake the most difficult tasks in various aspects. At present, 23 young workers of electric shovels and rock drills have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. More than 200 young people at the Third Construction Site in Hanoi collected more than 3,600 bricks, thousands of tons of scrap iron, and more than 30 cubic meters of wood in a recent day of voluntary labor. Children have also carried out various gift-giving activities. Children in the suburbs of Hanoi launched the "I Love Golden Rice" movement, using the money donated from gleaning rice ears in the fields to build a "Children's Plastics Factory."

    Leaders of the Vietnam Labor Party Central Committee, such as Le Duan, Truong Chinh, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Le Thanh Nghi, went deep into factories, mines, and rural areas to inspect, which greatly encouraged the broad masses of cadres, workers, and peasants, and played a huge role in promoting the competition movement.

    工农业战线爱国竞赛运动热火朝天
    越南人民以生产硕果向党献礼
    新华社河内12日电　本社记者报道：越南北方人民为迎接劳动党成立三十周年而开展的爱国竞赛运动目前正以雷霆万钧之势向前发展。从山区到平原，从中越边境到军事分界线，到处响彻着“向党献礼”的口号，广大职工、干部、合作社社员都表示坚决同时间赛跑，完成和超额完成国家生产计划。
    在工业战线上，目前全北方已有工业部、建筑部、交通和邮电部所属的八十一个企业和工地提前完成和超额完成今年全年的生产计划。一些大企业如海防水泥厂、南定纺织厂、鸿广、锦普煤矿，自从开展竞赛以来，生产都有飞跃的进展。海防水泥厂在11月份比原订计划增产二千多吨水泥，南定纺织厂11月份超额生产了六十五万五千多米布。越南最大的机器制造厂河内机器厂提前一个月零两天完成了全年生产计划。
    在农业战线上，广大农民在今年空前大丰收的鼓舞下，正在进一步开展冬春生产运动。目前兴修水利、积肥、大闹农具改革的运动比往年更加热烈，并且已经取得了显著的成绩。到目前为止，富寿省已经挖掘了十二万多土石方，可以保证四千六百八十公顷耕地的灌溉用水。基本上实现了合作化的永灵区，现在每个农业社平均每天积肥十吨到十五吨，这是过去从来没有的事。为了深耕，许多省的农业社把旧犁改制成五八式步犁。
    “爱国竞赛运动”不仅在工农业生产战线上迅速发展，而且也在军队、机关、学校、医院、公私合营企业中热烈地进行着。例如，有些学校提出“教师教好，学生学好”的要求，有些邮局提出“找人服务”的口号。通过竞赛，同志间的互助友爱精神大大得到发扬，工作效率有了显著提高。
    为了向党献礼，不论老人、青年、妇女和少年儿童，都大显身手，以自己的实际行动创造出优异的成绩。青年们是竞赛中一支坚强的突击力量。锦普煤矿的劳动青年团员和青年工人成立了各种突击队，担负各方面最困难的工作。目前，电铲和风钻机的青年工人中已有二十三人提前完成全年生产计划。河内市第三工地的二百多名青年，在最近的一天义务劳动中，就收集了三千六百多块砖、上千吨废铁和三十多立方米木料。少年儿童也进行了各种献礼活动。河内市郊少年开展了“我爱金谷”运动，用在田间拾来的谷穗捐款来建设“少年塑料厂”。
    越南劳动党中央领导人黎笋、长征、武元甲、黎清毅等同志深入厂、矿和农村视察，使广大干部、职工、农民受到很大鼓舞，对竞赛运动起了巨大的推动作用。
