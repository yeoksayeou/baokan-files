Tianjin, December 23 (report from our newspaper) — The office cadres of Tianjin Knitting Factory have launched a "Three Early" competition - early preparation of next year's plan, early preparation of next year's material supply, and early completion of next year's new product designs. This has had a positive effect on ensuring the fast and good preparation for next year's production work. Currently, the office cadres have already prepared next year's production plan. All six to seven thousand kinds of raw materials and materials needed for the first quarter have been secured, and key materials such as cotton yarn, caustic soda, and coal have been rationally stocked. The design work for the seven key new products that must be put into production in the first quarter of next year has been completed, and some have already begun trial production. Due to the early completion of these three tasks, all factory workers are now balancing production equipment, adjusting labor organization, and extensively discussing the production plan for the first quarter of next year.

In the past, Tianjin Knitting Factory's production preparation work was relatively late. In terms of plan preparation, it often dragged on until the new year. In terms of new product production, very few were produced in the first quarter of the year. The material supply was also very inadequate.

In order to change this situation and ensure a good start to the new year, the factory's Party committee launched the "Three Early" competition throughout the factory. At the beginning of the competition, the Party committee used small-scale debate meetings, seminars, individual talks, and other methods to clarify to the office cadres the situation of continued leap forward in production next year and the key issues of the factory. The Party organization also mobilized all employees to help the office cadres understand the factory's inventory of raw materials and the production status of each machine and worker. They also invited commercial workers with broad representation to discuss new product designs. Then the competition was launched vigorously. The sales personnel of the business section put forward the slogan of providing everything the workshop needs, and supplying whatever is lacking. The technical personnel of the technical section launched a product design movement that was comfortable, beautiful, and saved labor and materials. On the walls of the production planning section, labor and wages section, and other offices, the red flags of the competition were dazzling, and all kinds of slogans, challenge letters, and response letters were posted everywhere.

Through the enthusiastic "Three Early" competition, various preparatory tasks are proceeding at a rapid pace, and some difficulties have been resolved. For example, when starting to prepare the plan, the production planning section only had one planner left, but the factory had hundreds of major product categories, all of which had to be measured item by item. So the statisticians fully assisted and conducted a blitz, putting forward a draft plan. The designers also proposed a plan to design ninety new patterns and varieties in the first quarter of next year and put forty-nine into production. In order to put more new products into production in the first quarter, they also developed a very complex "nested cutting" method, cutting out women's jackets with a width of 100 cm from fabrics only 80 cm wide, breaking the limitations of equipment conditions. The sales personnel actively contacted major cotton textile factories, chemical companies, and other relevant units to place orders and purchase goods, ensuring that all material supplies were matched.

With the raw materials guaranteed, and the plans and products arranged in advance, the production workers in each workshop felt clear in their minds. They worked closely with the office cadres and took strong measures to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization and breakthrough key problems. In the recent short week, each workshop has implemented sixteen major innovation measures, saving fifteen large and small processes, laying a solid foundation for continued leap forward next year.

　　天津针织厂开展群众运动进行生产准备
    科室人员掀起“三提前”竞赛
    明年生产计划已经编制完毕  一季度所需物料有了合理储备  七种重要新产品完成设计
    本报天津23日电　天津市针织厂科室干部，开展提前编制明年计划、提前作好明年物资供应、提前作出明年新产品设计的“三提前”竞赛，对保证又快又好地作好明年生产准备工作，收到了良好的效果。目前，科室干部已经编制出明年的生产计划；第一季度所需的六、七千种原料和材料全部有了着落，棉纱、火碱、煤炭等各种关键性的物资，也有了合理储备。明年第一季度必须投入生产的关键性的七种新产品，设计工作已经完成，有的已开始了试制。由于三项工作的提前完成，全厂职工正在着手平衡生产设备，调整劳动组织，并广泛讨论明年一季度的生产计划。
    天津市针织厂历年来生产准备工作较晚。在计划编制方面往往要拖到来年去，在新产品的生产方面，历年来第一季度也很少生产；物资供应方面也很不凑手。
    工厂党委为了改变这种状况，保证明年开门红，即在全厂开展了“三提前”竞赛活动。竞赛一开始，就通过小型辩论会、座谈会、个别交谈等方法，向科室干部谈清明年生产继续跃进的形势及本厂的关键问题。党组织还发动了全体职工帮助科室干部摸清了原料材料的家底，以及各个机台、各个工人的生产状况。还邀请了具有广泛代表性的商业工作人员，座谈新产品设计。接着竞赛活动，就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。经营科的供销人员提出了车间要什么有什么，缺什么供应什么的竞赛口号。技术科的技术人员们搞起了舒适美观、省工料的产品设计运动。生产计划科、劳动工资科等等科室的墙壁上，竞赛的红旗鲜明夺目，各种各样的标语口号、挑战书、应战书贴得琳琅满目。
    经过热烈的“三提前”竞赛，各种准备工作以飞快的速度进行着，一些困难也解决了。比如开始编制计划的时候，生产计划科只留下一个计划员，可是工厂光大类产品就有好几百种，都要逐项测算。于是统计员们就全力协助，进行突击，提出了计划草案。设计人员也提出了明年第一季度就设计出九十种新花色品种，投入生产四十九种的计划。他们为了使第一季度内有更多的新产品投入生产，还研究出一种极为复杂的“套裁”方法，在只有八十公分宽的布料上，剪裁出一百公分宽的女式夹克外衣，打破了设备条件的限制。供销人员主动和各大棉纺织厂、化工公司等有关单位挂钩，进行定货、采购等活动，使物资供应全部对口。
    原料有了保证，计划和产品提前有了安排以后，各车间的生产工人也都心里亮堂了。他们和科室干部密切配合，采取了大搞机械化和半机械化、突破关键的有力措施。各车间在最近短短的一周里实现了十六项重大革新措施，省掉了大小十五个工序，为明年继续跃进打下了有力的基础。
