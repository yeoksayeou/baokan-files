Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 14th: The 20th session of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) opened here today.

Those attending the meeting included: WFTU President Giuseppe Di Vittorio, General Secretary Louis Saillant, WFTU Vice President and Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, V.V. Grishin, WFTU Vice President and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Changsheng, as well as members of the WFTU Executive Committee and trade union leaders from WFTU member countries.

The agenda of the meeting is: 1. A report by WFTU General Secretary Louis Saillant on "The Activities and Tasks of the Working Class, Trade Union Organizations and the WFTU in the Current Development of the International Situation"; 2. Discussion of the draft budget for 1960; 3. Determination of the agenda for the 11th session of the WFTU General Council; 4. Discussion of the issue of admitting the Iraqi Trade Union into the WFTU.

In his report, Saillant pointed out that the socialist camp, with its creative efforts and rich experience, has had a profound impact on the international situation. He said that the achievements of the socialist camp are a clear victory for the international workers' movement. World opinion is deeply impressed by the outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union.

Saillant emphasized that the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament has aroused widespread response in the international trade union movement. He said that the new task facing trade unions is to effectively mobilize millions of working people to fight for complete disarmament.

Next, Saillant spoke in detail about the WFTU's tasks in the struggle for peace, democratic rights and national independence.

A large part of Saillant's report addressed the WFTU's activities in the great movement for peace and social progress. Saillant said that some trade union leaders who are still hostile to establishing friendly relations with trade unions in socialist countries are uneasy about the achievements and development made by workers and trade unions in socialist countries in all aspects. Therefore, they tend to propose class cooperation programs from the industrial bourgeoisie, attempting to incorporate trade union life and activities into a system dominated by monopoly capital and pro-government forces. Obviously, their attitude does not offer effective solutions for workers. The strikes held by American steelworkers, Mexican railway workers, and Argentine workers in 1959 foreshadowed a period of more intense class struggle.

Saillant also elaborated on the WFTU's consistent policy of striving for unified action in the world workers' movement and condemned the leaders of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions for their boycott of this policy.

The meeting will conclude on the 17th.

    世界工联执委会第二十次会议开幕
    赛扬就工会组织当前的活动和任务作报告
    谴责自由工联领导集团抵制工人运动团结
    新华社布加勒斯特14日电　世界工会联合会执行委员会第二十次会议今天在这里开幕。
    出席会议的有：世界工联主席诺维拉，总书记赛扬，世界工联副主席、全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申，世界工联副主席、中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜，以及世界工联执委会的委员和世界工联各会员国的工会领导人等。
    会议议程是：一、世界工联总书记赛扬作关于“工人阶级、工会组织和世界工联在目前国际局势发展中的活动和任务”的报告；二、讨论1960年的预算草案；三、确定第十一届世界工联理事会会议的议程；四、讨论接纳伊拉克工会加入世界工联问题。
    赛扬在报告中指出，社会主义阵营以它的创造性努力，和丰富的经验，对国际形势产生深刻的影响。他说，社会主义阵营的成就，是国际工人运动的明显的胜利。世界舆论对苏联的卓越成就有深刻的印象。
    赛扬着重指出，苏联政府提出的全面彻底裁军的建议，在国际工会运动中引起了广泛反响。他说，工会面临的新任务就是有效地动员千百万劳动人民，为争取全面裁军而斗争。
    接着，赛扬详细地谈到了世界工联在争取和平、民主权利和民族独立的斗争中的任务。
    赛扬的报告有很大一部分谈到世界工联在争取和平和社会进步的伟大运动中的活动。赛扬说，某些仍敌视同社会主义国家工会建立友好关系的工会领袖，对社会主义国家工人和工会在各方面取得的成就和发展感到不安。因此，他们倾向于提出工业资产阶级纲领中的阶级合作方案，企图把工会生活和活动纳入垄断资本和亲政府的体制中去。显而易见，他们的态度，没有为工人提出有效的解决办法。美国钢铁工人、墨西哥铁路工人和阿根廷工人在1959年举行的罢工，预示了一个进行更激烈的阶级斗争的时期。
    赛扬还阐述了世界工联一向遵循的争取世界工人运动采取统一行动的政策，并谴责了自由工联领导集团对这一政策所采取的抵制态度。
    这次会议将在17日结束。
