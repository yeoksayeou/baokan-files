    Dams Completed, Canals Opened: A Coherent Whole
    Andong County Integrates New and Old Projects to Form a Complete Water Conservancy Irrigation Network
    Ningxiang Huitang Commune Makes Overall Plans to Realize Project Benefits as Soon as Possible
    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 8th) In water conservancy construction, Andong County, Liaoning, integrates new and old projects, combining newly built projects with the renovation and expansion of existing projects to form a water conservancy irrigation network, giving full play to irrigation benefits.
    In recent years, Andong County has vigorously implemented the water conservancy construction policy of "small-scale as the mainstay, water storage as the mainstay, and commune-run as the mainstay," achieving tremendous results. However, in the past, due to insufficient experience in water conservancy construction and time constraints, some water conservancy projects were incomplete, so many of the completed projects had not yet fully exerted their irrigation capabilities. For example, some reservoirs, after being built, had short dams, thin crests, and low water storage, resulting in a small irrigated area; some reservoirs lacked spillways and filtration equipment, resulting in water seepage through the dams. Others had reservoirs but no canals, so there was no way to irrigate the fields. The Shanchengzi Reservoir in Qianyang Commune can store enough water to irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land, but the existing canals can only irrigate 4,000 mu. The remaining water is released into the river and then pumped into the fields by machinery, which wastes both labor and water.
    In view of the above situation, the Andong County Party Committee proposed that this winter's water conservancy construction should focus on both new and old projects. On the one hand, vigorously develop new water conservancy projects to increase water sources and expand the irrigated area; on the other hand, actively renovate and expand existing water conservancy projects, supplementing whatever is lacking, so that existing water conservancy projects are complete and can give full play to their effectiveness. To this end, the County Party Committee decided that in addition to accelerating the completion of newly built projects, it is also necessary to raise and thicken the original thirteen reservoirs with a storage capacity of one million cubic meters, changing them from annual regulation of water use to multi-year regulation of water use, thereby increasing water storage. The county will also improve and increase the spillways of thirteen reservoirs, including Helong, Taiping, and Hejia, repair and reinforce the revetments, and add filtration equipment to ensure the safety of the dams, and renovate and strengthen 130 ponds and dams. In addition, it is also necessary to rectify and improve the canal systems and field projects in the original irrigation areas; increase drainage and irrigation equipment and water lifting tools; and extensively exchange experience in the organization and management of irrigation projects in order to improve the utilization rate of irrigation projects and give full play to irrigation benefits.
    Currently, more than 54,000 people throughout the county are participating in the winter water conservancy construction battle every day, and have completed 462 projects of various kinds, completing more than 540,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work.
    (Our newspaper, Changsha, 9th) When constructing the Dongting Reservoir, the Huitang Commune in Ningxiang County, Hunan, connected the main dam, auxiliary dam, spillway, and canals, making overall plans to ensure that the dam is completed and the canals are opened, so that it can store water, release overflows, and irrigate, in order to maximize the benefits of water storage, flood control, and irrigation as quickly as possible.
    The Dongting Reservoir can store 5.1 million cubic meters of water, irrigate about 20,000 mu of land, and also generate 130 kilowatts of electricity, and can also raise a large number of fish and ducks. Because the Huitang Commune paid attention to the overall arrangement of the main dam, auxiliary dam, spillway, and canals when it began to build the reservoir, the 21-meter-high main dam has been completed to ten meters so far, the auxiliary dam project has been fully completed, the spillway project has been completed by 40％, and twenty-seven of the sixty li long canals have been completed.
    At the beginning, some people felt that the project was too large and the labor force was strained, so they could only do the main dam first and then the auxiliary dam, build the dam first and then the spillway, and build the canals next year. Therefore, the canal project had not been surveyed and designed. When reviewing this plan, the Huitang Commune Party Committee believed that it would be impossible to store water if only the dam was built without a good spillway; if the canals were not well built, the stored water could not be used for irrigation. Therefore, it proposed the principle of simultaneous dam and canal construction, with benefits accruing as soon as construction was completed, and revised the design. In order to correct the ideological understanding of some people, the commune also organized cadres and the masses for a debate. During the debate, everyone cited the following two facts for comparison: One was the Wenchong Reservoir, built in 1957. This reservoir implemented the comprehensive construction of the dam, spillway, and diversion canal from the beginning. After a blitz by 1,800 people, it was completed simultaneously at the end of that year. Water storage began in the spring of 1958, and it quickly played its role in flood prevention and irrigation. The four hundred mu of paddy fields that had been washed away by floods in previous years were spared from floods, and the water from the reservoir irrigated the drought-stricken seedlings during the summer dry season. The other was the Shitang Reservoir, built in 1953. In that year, only the dam was built, without a spillway. When the water rose in the spring of the second year, the reservoir was not able to store water, and the seven hundred mu of land that had been washed away by mountain floods in the past still suffered losses. Later, the spillway was built, but the canals were not built, so it was impossible to irrigate when drought occurred in the summer. These facts deeply educated everyone, and everyone unanimously agreed that projects must be complete, accomplished in one go, and not left unfinished, in order to maximize irrigation benefits as quickly as possible.
    In order to ensure the completion of the projects, the Huitang Commune first made overall arrangements for leadership and labor. The headquarters for the construction of the reservoir has a total of five leaders, one of whom is responsible for the overall situation, and the other four are responsible for the main dam, auxiliary dam, spillway, and canal projects, respectively. In terms of labor arrangement, a total of 9,800 people participated in the construction of the reservoir. According to work needs, 800 people were first arranged to blitz the quarrying, foundation clearing, and culvert construction of the main dam. At the same time, 3,000 people were arranged to work on the auxiliary dam. When the auxiliary dam was completed, the foundation clearing and culvert projects of the main dam were also completed at the same time. At this time, 2,000 people were transferred from the auxiliary dam to blitz the earthwork of the main dam, and 1,000 people were transferred to blitz four more difficult sections of the canals. Among the original 800 people responsible for foundation clearing and quarrying of the main dam, 500 people were transferred to open the spillway, and 300 people were responsible for the stone work of the canals. At the same time as the main dam project started, the thirteen benefiting brigades in the entire commune mobilized 6,000 commune members to contract the construction of the canals in sections and divisions. In this way, all the projects started simultaneously.

    坝成渠通　一气呵成
    安东县新旧工程兼顾形成完整水利灌溉网
    宁乡灰汤公社通盘规划尽快发挥工程效益
    本报沈阳8日电　辽宁安东县在水利建设中，做到新旧工程兼顾，使新建工程和整修扩建原有工程相结合，形成水利灌溉网，充分发挥灌溉效益。
    几年来，安东县大力贯彻“小型为主、蓄水为主、社办为主”的水利建设方针，取得了巨大的成绩。但是，过去由于水利建设的经验不足，时间紧迫，使有些水利工程还不成套，因此许多已建的工程还没有全部发挥灌溉效能。如有的水库修起后，坝矮、冕薄、蓄水不多，灌溉面积少，有的水库没有溢洪道和滤水设备，结果“片坝”渗水；也有的修了水库没修渠道，有水没法灌田。前阳公社山城子水库，蓄的水能灌田一万多亩，但现有的渠道只能灌四千亩，其余的水放到河沟里，再用机械抽到田里，既浪费劳力，又浪费水。
    根据上述情况，中共安东县委提出今冬的水利建设，要新旧工程一齐抓，一方面大抓新的水利工程，增加水源，扩大灌溉面积；另方面要积极整修和扩建现有的水利工程，缺什么补什么，使现有的水利工程成套，充分发挥水利工程的效能。为此，县委确定除了要加速完成新建的各项工程外，还要把原有的十三座蓄水一百万立方米的水库，加高培厚，由一年调节用水变为多年调节用水，增加蓄水量。对合隆、太平、何家等十三座水库，要分别改善和增加溢洪道，修整护坡和增施滤水设备，确保大坝安全，整修加固塘坝一百三十座。另外还要整顿和改善原有灌区的渠道系统和田间工程；增加排灌设备和提水工具，广泛交流灌溉工程的组织管理经验，以提高灌溉工程利用率，充分发挥灌溉效益。
    现在全县每天出动五万四千多人投入冬季水利施工的战斗，已完成各种工程四百六十二项，完成土石方量五十四万多方。
    本报长沙9日电　湖南宁乡县灰汤公社在修建洞庭水库时，把主坝、副坝、溢洪道、渠道等工程联系起来，通盘规划，保证做到坝成渠通，能蓄、能溢、能灌，以便最快地发挥蓄水拦洪和灌溉效能。
    洞庭水库能蓄水五百一十万方，灌田二万亩左右，还能发电一百三十瓩，并且能大量养鱼养鸭。由于灰汤公社开始修建这座水库时，就注意了全面安排主坝、副坝、溢洪道、渠道等工程。到目前为止，二十一米高的主坝已完成十米，副坝工程已全部完成，溢洪道工程完成了40％，六十华里长的渠道完成了二十七华里。
    开始，有些人觉得工程太大，劳动力紧张，只能先主坝后副坝，先修坝后修溢洪道，到明年再修渠道。因此，在设计时，对于渠道工程没有进行勘测设计。中共灰汤公社党委在审查这个计划时，认为只修好大坝不修好溢洪道就不能蓄水；不修好渠道，蓄了水也发挥不了灌溉效能。于是提出坝渠并举，修好就能受益的原则，重新修改了设计。为了端正一些人的思想认识，公社还组织干部和群众进行了一次辩论。在辩论中，大家举出了这样两个事实进行对比：一个是1957年兴建的文冲水库。这个水库一开始就做到了大坝、溢洪道、引水渠全面施工，经过一千八百人突击，在当年年底同时竣工，1958年春天开始蓄水，很快发挥了防洪、灌溉的效能，往年受到洪水冲洗的四百亩水田，免除了洪水为患，夏季天干时，水库的水又灌溉了受旱的禾苗。另一个是1953年修建的石塘水库，这个水库当年只修好了主坝，没有修溢洪道，第二年春天水上涨时，不敢蓄水，过去受山洪冲洗的七百亩田还是遭受了损失；后来修好了溢洪道，但渠道又没有修成，到夏天遭旱时，无法灌溉。这些事实，深刻地教育了大家，一致同意工程必须成套，一气呵成，不留尾巴，才能最快地发挥灌溉效能。
    为了确保工程成套，灰汤公社首先全面安排了领导力量和劳动力。修建这个水库的指挥部共有五个负责人，除一个掌握全面外，其他四人分别负责主坝、副坝、溢洪道、渠道工程。在劳动力安排上，共有九千八百人参加这个水库的修建工程，根据工作需要，首先安排了八百人突击主坝的采石、清基、建涵洞。与此同时，安排三千人搞副坝，等到副坝完成时，主坝的清基、涵洞等工程也同时完成。这时，从副坝上抽调两千人突击主坝土方，抽一千人突击渠道的四处比较困难的工程。原来负担主坝清基、采石的八百人中，有五百人转入开溢洪道，有三百人负责渠道的石方工程。在主坝工程开工的同时，全公社十三个受益的大队动员了六千社员，分段分工包干修建渠道。就这样，全部工程同时开工了。
