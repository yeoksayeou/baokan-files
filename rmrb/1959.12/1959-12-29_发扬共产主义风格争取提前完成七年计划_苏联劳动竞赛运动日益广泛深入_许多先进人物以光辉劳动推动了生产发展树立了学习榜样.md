Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 28th: (By our correspondent) This year, the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet people's labor enthusiasm and political enthusiasm have greatly increased. In all parts of the country and on all fronts of production and construction, the broad masses of working people have enthusiastically launched various labor emulation movements, which have been carried out very extensively and deeply, and have achieved great results. In the movement, advanced figures and initiatives emerged one after another, and people's communist style has been further improved.

This year's socialist emulation of the Soviet working people was launched before the opening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the end of February this year, and after the congress, it developed more deeply in all aspects. The concentrated goal of the competition is to strive for early completion of the Seven-Year Plan. This competition was first initiated by individual regions and individual work teams. For example, at the beginning of this year, the famous miners Mamai and Belousov first proposed to ensure that the work teams they led would complete the Seven-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule. Oil workers in the Bashkir Autonomous Republic put forward the initiative to strive to complete the tasks of the first year of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In terms of agricultural production, the Ryazan region first launched a competition to drastically increase livestock production, and the agricultural laborers in this region guaranteed to complete the Seven-Year Plan tasks for meat and milk ahead of schedule.

The vigorous and surging situation created by the working people's initiative and labor enthusiasm made the completion of the Soviet production plan in the first quarter of this year very good. On this basis, the nationwide socialist labor emulation to strive for early completion of the Seven-Year Plan was rapidly launched in various states and union republics like a raging fire. The workers and staff in the republics of Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan; the states of Sverdlovsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, and Chelyabinsk; and the cities of Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev have successively expressed that they will strive to complete the industrial output value targets, production targets of a certain industrial sector, or targets for improving labor productivity set by the Seven-Year Plan one or two years ahead of schedule. Many factories and enterprises and more production teams have stated that they will complete the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan in three years. In agriculture, the vast majority of union republics, states, and territories have guaranteed that the output of agricultural and livestock products will reach the level of 1965 stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in four or five years or even less.

This year's socialist emulation upsurge of the Soviet working people has spread to every work post, and the content is very rich. In the competition, all departments and regions have put forward competition goals and content suitable for their own departments and regions. For example, young workers on the railway launched the "Communist Youth League Carriage" competition, young people across the country proposed to strengthen the competition for collecting scrap iron, housing construction workers proposed to save funds in construction in order to build more houses, automobile transportation workers proposed to explore the potential of automobile transportation, young people in the Tianshan area of ​​the Kyrgyz Republic proposed the initiative to develop the Tianshan area, rural youths in Armenia launched a competition to make every hectare of land achieve a bumper harvest, and rural tractor drivers proposed a competition to fully mechanize agricultural production. These initiatives and competitions are all aimed at the specific circumstances of various departments and regions, and propose specific measures and tasks.

After the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in June, the socialist emulation movement in various parts of the Soviet Union and in various departments has undergone new developments. The competition focuses on important aspects such as technological progress, mass invention and creation, exploration of production potential, rigorous increase in production and conservation, and acceleration of the speed of basic construction. Industrial enterprises in various regions have established "Technical Promotion Committees," "Technical Progress Supervision Committees," and "Comprehensive Work Teams." The Moscow First Ball Bearing Factory, the Likhachev Automobile Factory, and the "Red Proletarian" Factory mobilized forces within and outside the factory to organize comprehensive specialized work teams to solve key problems in technological innovation, which resulted in the very rapid promotion of production automation. At present, the number of people in the Soviet Union participating in invention and rationalization proposals has reached more than two million. In the first nine months of this year alone, 1.4 million inventions and rationalization proposals were adopted nationwide, saving 7 billion rubles.

An important feature of this year's socialist emulation is that tens of thousands of urban and rural workers are demanding to improve their communist spirit and style. Therefore, as soon as the movements such as "Communist Labor Team," "Communist Shock Worker," and the movement of advanced workers helping the backward first initiated by the advanced female worker Gaganova appeared, they quickly gained widespread support and response. At present, in industrial enterprises across the country, nearly 190,000 work teams are participating in the movement to win the honorary title of "Communist Labor Team" alone. This movement has brought about tremendous changes in the production of enterprises and the study and life of workers. For example, the workers at the Moscow-Ryazan Railway marshalling station, the initiators of the movement, have shortened the time for repairing locomotives by half in the past year, most of the workers have participated in study, and their communist moral character has also been greatly improved. Linked to the "Communist Labor Team" movement is the "Communist Shock Worker" movement first initiated by the workers of the Moscow "Red Presnya" factory. About 300,000 young people are now vying for this glorious title.

The movement initiated by Gaganova has now swept the country, and the content of the movement is constantly being supplemented and developed. For example, Yarovsky, a turner at the Simferopol Motor Factory in the Crimean Oblast, proposed that the production quota of each worker be increased to the level of advanced producers. Under his active leadership, the production quota of his workshop has increased by 40% in the past three months. For example, the workers of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory in Stalingrad are working hard to carry out technical innovation in their own factory, while driving the technically backward gas equipment factory to carry out technical improvements, making it possible for this factory to double its output in 1960.

In this year's surging labor emulation, many heroic figures have emerged on all fronts of production in the Soviet Union. The work team where the famous female textile worker Gaganova is now located has become an advanced work team and won the glorious title of "Communist Labor Team". Vechirova, a female textile worker from Ivanovo, reached the labor productivity level of 1965 stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan this year. The work team of Rustamov, a marine oil well driller in Azerbaijan, is famous throughout the country. They adopted new drilling methods to increase the drilling speed of marine oil wells by more than double. The initiative of Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory technician Pronkin to enthusiastically help young workers improve their technical and cultural level has won the praise and support of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The initiative of Manukovsky, the captain of a tractor team in Voronezh, to comprehensively mechanize agricultural labor has been enthusiastically responded to in various places.

Many production experts have also emerged in state farms and collective farms. Many collective farm members in the Ryazan region have become well-known figures across the country because they have increased meat production several times in one year this year. These advanced figures promoted the development of production and construction with their glorious labor and set an example for the broad masses of workers to learn from. (Attached picture)

　　发扬共产主义风格争取提前完成七年计划
    苏联劳动竞赛运动日益广泛深入
    许多先进人物以光辉劳动推动了生产发展树立了学习榜样
    新华社莫斯科28日电　本社记者报道：今年，七年计划第一年，苏联人民劳动热情和政治热情大大高涨。在全国各地和各个生产建设战线上，广大劳动人民热烈开展了各种劳动竞赛运动，这些运动的开展十分广泛和深入，并且获得了巨大的成绩。在运动中，先进人物和倡议层出不穷，人们的共产主义风格得到了进一步的提高。
    今年苏联劳动人民的社会主义竞赛，在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会在今年2月底开幕以前即已展开，而在代表大会以后，愈加向各方面纵深发展。竞赛集中的目标是争取提前完成七年计划。这个竞赛首先是由个别地区和个别工作队发起的。例如，在今年年初，著名矿工马马伊和别洛乌索夫首先提出保证，要使自己领导的工作队提前两年完成七年计划。巴什基尔自治共和国的石油工人提出了争取提前完成七年计划第一年的任务的倡议。在农业生产方面，梁赞州首先发起急剧增加畜产品生产的竞赛，这个州的农业劳动者保证提前完成肉类、奶品的七年计划任务。
    劳动人民的首创精神和劳动积极性所造成的蓬勃高涨的形势，使得今年第一季度苏联的生产计划完成情况非常良好。在这个基础上，争取提前完成七年计划的全民社会主义劳动竞赛，就如火如荼地在各个州和各个加盟共和国迅速展开。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、哈萨克、乌兹别克、阿塞拜疆、土库曼等共和国，斯维尔德洛夫斯克、卢干斯克、第聂伯罗彼德罗夫斯克、车里雅宾斯克等州，以及莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅等市的职工都先后表示，要争取提前一年或两年完成七年计划规定的工业总产值指标，某一工业部门的生产指标或提高劳动生产率的指标。许多工厂企业和更多的生产队表示要以三年的时间完成七年计划的任务。在农业方面，绝大多数加盟共和国、州和边疆区都保证，要在四、五年甚至更短的时间内，使农畜产品产量达到七年计划规定的1965年的水平。
    今年苏联劳动人民的社会主义竞赛热潮遍及各个工作岗位，内容非常丰富。在竞赛中，各部门和各地区都提出了适合本部门、本地区需要的竞赛目标和竞赛内容。例如，铁路上的青年工人发起了“共青团车厢”竞赛，全国青少年提出了加强收集废铁的竞赛，住宅建筑工人提出了在建设中节约资金，以便更多地建住宅的竞赛，汽车运输工人提出了发掘汽车运输潜力的竞赛，吉尔吉斯共和国天山地区的青年提出了开发天山地区的倡议，亚美尼亚的农村青年发起了使每公顷土地都获得丰收的竞赛，农村拖拉机手提出使农业生产全盘机械化的竞赛。这些倡议和竞赛都针对各部门和地区的具体情况，提出了具体措施和任务。
    在苏共中央六月全会以后，苏联各地和各部门的社会主义竞赛运动又有了新的发展，竞赛着重围绕技术进步，群众性发明创造、发掘生产潜力、厉行增产节约、加速基本建设速度等重要方面进行。各地工业企业成立了“技术促进委员会”、“技术进步监督委员会”和“综合工作队”。莫斯科第一滚珠轴承工厂、利哈乔夫汽车工厂、“红色无产者”工厂动员厂内和外界的力量，组织综合专门工作队来解决技术革新中的关键性的问题，结果使生产自动化工作推行得非常迅速。现在，全苏联参加发明创造与合理化建议的人数已达二百万以上。仅今年头九个月，全国就采用了一百四十万件发明和合理化建议，节约七十亿卢布。
    今年的社会主义竞赛的一个重要特点是，成千成万城乡劳动者都要求提高共产主义的精神和风格。因此，像“共产主义劳动队”、“共产主义突击手”运动以及由先进女工加干诺娃首倡的先进帮助落后的运动刚一出现，很快就获得了广泛的支持和响应。目前，在全国工业企业中，单是参加争取“共产主义劳动队”光荣称号的运动的就有将近十九万个工作队。这一运动使企业的生产和职工的学习与生活都发生了极大的变化。例如，运动的发起者莫斯科—梁赞铁路调车站的职工一年来已经把修理机车的时间缩短了一半，绝大部分职工都参加了学习，他们的共产主义道德品质也大大提高了。和“共产主义劳动队”运动联系在一起的是，莫斯科“红色普列斯尼亚”工厂的工人首倡的“共产主义突击手”运动。现在已约有三十万青年正在争取这个光荣的称号。
    由加干诺娃发起的运动现已席卷全国，而且运动的内容不断得到补充和发展。例如，克里米亚州的森佛罗波尔电机工厂车工雅罗夫斯基倡议，使每个工人的生产定额都提高到先进生产者的水平。在他的积极带动下，最近三个月来，他所在的车间的生产定额已提高了40％。又如，斯大林格勒的斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂的职工一边努力进行本厂的技术革新，一边带动技术上较落后的瓦斯设备工厂进行技术改进，使这个工厂有可能在1960年就把产量提高一倍半。
    在今年的汹涌澎湃的劳动竞赛中，苏联各个生产战线上都涌现了许多英雄人物，著名的纺织女工加干诺娃现在所在的工作队已变成了先进工作队，获得了“共产主义劳动队”的光荣称号。伊凡诺佛州纺织女工维契罗娃在今年就达到了七年计划所规定的1965年劳动生产率水平。阿塞拜疆海上石油井掘进工人鲁斯塔莫夫的工作队驰名全国，他们采用新的掘进方法使海上油井的掘进速度提高了一倍以上。莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂技师普隆金热情帮助青年工人提高技术文化水平的创举，获得了共青团中央的赞扬和支持。沃罗涅日的拖拉机队长马努科夫斯基发起的使农业劳动全面机械化的倡议，得到了各地的热烈响应。
    国营农场和集体农庄中也出现了许多生产能手。梁赞州的许多集体农庄庄员由于在今年一年内把肉类生产增加了好几倍，现在已经成为全国的知名人物。这些先进人物以自己的光辉劳动推动了生产和建设事业的发展，树立了广大劳动者学习的榜样。（附图片）
