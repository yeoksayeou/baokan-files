Heroes Battle Guan Jiao Mountain
　　*Qinghai Daily* Reporters Gu Hong, Wu Man

　　Guan Jiao Mountain, like a great roc spreading its wings, stretches its neck toward the azure sky, majestic and towering. The surrounding hills undulate, and the mountain ranges overlap. The Guan Jiao Pass tunnel project of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway, which is under intense construction, is located here.

　　Plateau Tunnel

　　The Guan Jiao Pass tunnel project is an important control project on the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway line and one of the three major railway tunnel projects in China. It is four thousand and five meters long, second only to the Shaburada Tunnel on the Chengdu-Kunming line and the Liangfeng Pass Tunnel on the Sichuan-Guizhou line, both of which are also under construction. It is located west of the famous inland lake Qinghai Lake, about three hundred and fifty kilometers east of Xining. This area is not only as high as 4,200 meters above sea level, but also has a very dangerous terrain. For a long time, people have hoped that one day a transportation artery could be opened up here. In a stone cave not far south of the construction site, we can still see the poems left by predecessors: "If you want to leave a trace for eternity, first cut off the top of this mountain with a knife." But in the past, this could only be an unattainable ideal.

　　Now, everything here has changed. The Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway, which is more than 1,400 kilometers long, will soon pass through here, reaching the oil-producing areas in the northern and western parts of the Qaidam Basin. On the construction site, which stretches for seven or eight *li*, white tents, sod-covered houses, and simple sheds are everywhere, and the sound of machines never stops day and night. Crowds of people shuttle back and forth on the construction site. A year ago, this place was still deserted; today, a year later, it is a bustling mountain town with more than 4,000 people.

　　Heroic Battle

　　Over the past year, the more than 4,000 employees of the Fourth Engineering Office of the Xining Railway Bureau, who are responsible for this project, have experienced so much hardship and fierce battle here! Last autumn, when they accepted the task and traveled thousands of miles from all over the country to come here, difficulties appeared one after another in front of them. Not only did the climate change drastically, with the coldest winter temperatures dropping to more than minus 40 degrees Celsius and a diurnal temperature range of about 30 degrees, but also because the altitude was high and the air was thin, people were panting for breath after working for a while. An air compressor that could power three air drills in other places could only power two here. But what were these difficulties to the workers who deeply believed in their own strength? When there were no materials to build houses, the workers cut down *Jing* vines from the mountains to make the roof; when there were no bricks and tiles, they cut the sod on the ground to replace them. In this way, the workers leveled the foundation and built more than 20,000 square meters of work sheds, dormitories, and canteens at the barren foot of Guan Jiao Mountain, and began a boiling battle life.

　　This is something that happened in June of this year.

　　At dawn, just as the excavation workers had set off the explosives and the slag removal workers were busy entering the tunnel to remove the slag, in the midst of the smoky mist, a deafening rushing sound suddenly rang out in the tunnel.

　　"Flood!" people said alertly.

　　Before the words were finished, the floodwater gushing out from the springs in the tunnel had pounced on the people like countless ferocious beasts. It flowed dozens of meters in an instant, with a maximum hourly flow of more than 700 tons. Seeing that the 300-meter-long tunnel was about to be swallowed by the flood and the entire project was about to be seriously affected, the workers felt as if their hearts were being cut by a knife.

　　"What to do?" Anxiety enveloped the entire construction site.

　　"What are you waiting for? Block the spring!" This shout rang out from the crowd. Then many people rushed into the tunnel against the water without even taking off their clothes. The water was very turbulent, and many people were knocked down, but they got up and rushed in regardless of everything. The icy spring water pierced their bones, and the workers were soaked all over and shivering from the cold. But the workers forgot the cold, forgot everything, and worked tirelessly. The water was deep, and people couldn't carry cement in, so the workers made rafts out of wooden boards to transport it in. After five days and five nights of continuous fighting, the ferocious flood was finally subdued, saving the project from loss. The workers said excitedly: "What is mountain water? Obey me obediently. If I tell it to flow east, it doesn't dare to flow west." In order to open up the tunnel as soon as possible and let the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway extend to the treasure basin of the motherland—the Qaidam Basin, the tunnel workers have experienced countless such tests and battles in the past year or so. Day and night, they are constantly going in and out of the water and mud, waging a tireless struggle against unpredictable floods, hard rocks, and cemented soil. When their clothes got wet during the day, they dried them at night and put them back on the next day, and the rubber boots wore through the bottoms. In this way, from September last year to now, the workers have dug more than 1,400 meters of tunnel, accounting for more than one-third of the main tunnel project.

　　The First Generation of Tibetan Tunnel Workers

　　Here, the more than 4,000 employees are not only a fighting collective but also a loving collective. Many workers from different regions and different ethnic groups, who had no technical knowledge in the past, have grown into various excellent technicians with the help of this collective. Tibetan excavation worker Zha Cairen is a clear example. He is from Hualong County, Qinghai Province, is only eighteen years old this year, a member of the Communist Youth League, and speaks both Tibetan and Chinese fluently. When he came to the construction site in July this year, his parents did not allow him to participate, saying that the road was far, the suffering was great, and they had never even seen a railway, so how could he build a railway?

　　Yes, for Zha Cairen, he had no idea what a railway was like. In the decades of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's rule in Qinghai, in addition to plundering the people, they had not even built a decent road, let alone a railway. But Zha Cairen still came to the railway construction site. He said to his parents: "Isn't Chairman Mao always thinking of us? Before liberation, I worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord and had no food to eat for half a year. Now our family is doing well. The country needs people for construction. Can we not listen to Chairman Mao?" In this way, Zha Cairen persuaded his parents and left home.

　　Under the cultivation of the Party and the help of his comrades, Zha Cairen has made rapid progress. Now he has become an air drill operator and works with his comrades in shifts. The workers call him the first generation of Tibetan tunnel workers and teach him technology like a blood brother. And he? He also studies very seriously. In addition to learning from the Han workers in his work, he also participates in cultural classes. When people ask him what profession he wants to pursue in the future, he always says with excitement and pride: "To be a tunnel worker!"

　　Red Flowers in Winter

　　Now it is already a severe winter here. In previous years, outdoor work would have been completed at this time, but this year, inspired by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the tunnel workers have broken this convention. As soon as the autumn offensive ended, the winter offensive began. The good news on production is like red flowers blooming in winter, emerging one after another. The new record that was just created today is replaced by a newer record tomorrow. When we first came here, the daily progress record was 8.7 meters, but after four or five days, it was refreshed to 12.5 meters. At this speed, their construction period can be greatly advanced.

　　英雄大战关角山
　　青海日报记者　古洪  吴缦
    关角山，像一只展翅欲飞的大鹏，引颈伸向碧蓝的天空，巍峨、挺拔。四周岗峦起伏，山岭重叠。正在紧张施工的兰青铁路关角垭口隧道工程就在这里。
    高原隧道
    关角垭口隧道工程，是兰青铁路线上的一个重要控制工程，也是我国三大铁道隧道工程之一。全长四千零五米，仅次于同时正在施工中的成（成都）昆（昆明）线的沙布拉达隧道，和川（四川）黔（贵州）线上的凉风垭隧道。它位于全国闻名的内陆湖青海湖以西，距离东面的西宁约三百五十公里。这里不仅海拔高达四千二百米，而且地势十分险要。很早以来，人们就希望有一天能在这里开辟出一条交通大道来。在南去工地不远的一个石洞中，至今还可以见到前人留下的诗句：“尘世欲留千古迹，挥刀先砍此山头。”可是在过去，这却始终只能是一个无法实现的理想。
    如今，这里的一切都变了。全长一千四百多公里的兰青铁路，很快地就将从这里穿过，直达柴达木盆地北部和西部的石油产区。在绵延七、八华里长的工地上，到处布满了白色的帐房、用草皮盖起来的房子和朴实的工棚，机器的响声昼夜不停。工地上的人群往来穿梭。一年前这里还是荒无人烟，一年后的今天，这里已是一个拥有四千多人的山间闹市了。
    英勇的战斗
    一年来，担负这一工程的西宁铁路局第四工程处的四千多名职工，在这里是经历过了多少的艰辛和激烈的战斗啊！去年秋天，当他们接受了任务，从祖国各地千里迢迢地来到这里的时候，困难就一个紧接一个地在他们面前出现了。这里不仅气候变化剧烈，冬季最冷的气温要下降到摄氏零下四十多度，昼夜温差达三十度左右，而且因为地势高，空气稀薄，没有工作一会，人就累得直喘气。一台空气压缩机，在别的地方能带三个风钻，在这里只能带两个。但是这些困难，对于深信自己力量的工人们来说，又算得了什么呢？盖房子没有材料，工人们就从山上割回了荆条作房子顶盖；没有砖瓦，就割地上的草皮来代替。就这样，工人们平整了地基，在荒凉的关角山麓盖起了两万多平方米的工棚、宿舍和食堂，开始了沸腾的战斗生活。
    这是今年6月里发生的一件事。
    黎明，当开挖工刚放过炮，出碴工忙着进峒出碴时，在硝烟弥漫中，突然峒里响起了震耳的哗哗声。
    “洪水！”人们警惕地说。
    话音未落，从峒内泉眼中涌出来的洪水已经像无数条凶恶的猛兽直向人们扑了过来。一下就淌了几十米远，最高时每小时的出水量达到七百多吨。眼看三百多米的成峒马上就要被洪水吞没，整个工程就要因此而受到严重的影响。工人们的心里像刀割一样的心痛。
    “怎么办？”焦急、不安笼罩了整个工地。
    “还等什么，堵泉眼去！”人群中响起了这一叫声。接着许多人连衣服都不脱，便迎着水头朝峒里冲去。水流很急，许多人都被冲倒了，但是爬起来，还是不顾一切地往里冲。冰冷的泉水砭人肌骨，工人们的周身都湿了，冻得直打哆嗦。但是工人们却忘了寒冷，忘了一切，毫不停息地干着。水深，人扛着水泥进不去，工人们就用木板作成筏子往里运。经过了五天五夜的持续战斗，凶恶的洪水终于被人们制服了，使工程避免了损失。工人们兴奋地说：“山水算什么，乖乖听我话，叫它朝东流，不敢往西下。”为了早日打通隧道，让兰青铁路伸向祖国的聚宝盆——柴达木盆地，隧道工人们在这一年多的时间中，不知经历了多少次这样的考验和战斗。他们日日夜夜总是不断地在水里来，泥里去，同捉摸不到的洪水、坚硬的岩石和胶结的泥土，展开了永不倦怠的斗争。白天衣服湿了，晚上烤干，第二天就又穿起来了，胶皮靴磨破了底子。就这样，从去年9月到现在，工人们共挖了一千四百多米的隧道成峒，占隧道主体工程的三分之一以上。
    藏族的第一代隧道工
    在这里，四千多名职工，不仅是个战斗的集体，而且还是个友爱的集体。许多来自不同地区、不同民族的工人，过去连一点技术知识都没有，但是在这个集体的帮助下，都已经成长为各种优秀的技术工人了。藏族开挖工扎才仁就是一个明显的例子。他是青海省化隆县人，今年刚十八岁，共青团员，藏汉话都说得很流利。今年7月间来工地时，他父母亲不让他参加，说路又远，苦又大，见都没见过铁路，还能修铁路？
    是的，对于扎才仁来说，铁路究竟是个什么样子，他是一点也不知道的。在蒋马匪帮统治青海的几十年中，除了掠夺人民外，甚至连个像样的公路都没有修成，铁路就更不用说了。但是扎才仁还是来到了铁路工地。他对父母亲说：“毛主席啥时不是为我们呢，解放前，给地主扛长工，半年没粮吃，现在我们家好了，国家建设需要人，我们能不听毛主席的话吗？”就这样，扎才仁说服了他的父母亲，离开了家。
    在党的培养和同志们的帮助下，扎才仁进步很快，现在他已经成了一个风钻手，和同志们一起顶班劳动，工人们称他为藏族第一代隧道工人，像亲兄弟一样，教给他技术。他呢？也很认真学习，除了在工作中跟汉族的工人同志们学习外，还参加文化班的学习。当人们问他今后要从事什么职业时，他总是充满激动骄傲的心情说：“当一个隧道工！”
    冬日里的红花
    现在这里已经是严寒的冬季了。往年，野外工作这时候都已经收工了，但是今年隧道工人在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，却打破了这个常规。秋季攻势刚结束，冬季攻势接着便开始了。生产上的捷报如同冬日里盛开的红花一样，层出不穷。今天刚创造的新纪录，明天就又被更新的纪录所代替了。当我们刚来这里时，日进成峒纪录是八点七米，但是过了四、五天，便刷新为十二点五米了。按照这一速度，他们的工期是可以大大提前的。
    英雄的工地英雄的人，你们就像关角山一样雄伟！（附图片）
