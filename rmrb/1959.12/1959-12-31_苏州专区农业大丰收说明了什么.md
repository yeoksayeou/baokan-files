What Does the Great Agricultural Harvest in Suzhou Prefecture Show?
Our Commentator

Today's news in this newspaper about the comprehensive bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, this year powerfully confirms to people that regions with consistently high yields can achieve high yields year after year and continuously leap forward.

However, some people once expressed doubts about the potential for increased production in high-yield areas, believing that the production level in high-yield areas was already quite high and could no longer leap forward; it could only progress gradually, not leap forward. The reason was that high-yield areas had a good foundation and a large base, making it impossible to increase production significantly.

Can high-yield areas continue to achieve high yields, and even higher yields? The experience of Suzhou Prefecture tells us that they can. The key lies in having the lofty aspirations of communists, having ambitious goals, and developing production at the fastest speed and with the greatest effort. The most fundamental experience of Suzhou Prefecture in achieving substantial increases in production for two consecutive years is that the Party committees at all levels have always held high the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the great leap forward, and the brilliant banner of the people's communes, arming people's minds with the idea of continuous leap forward, so that the vast number of cadres and masses have maintained vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm from beginning to end. The fact that agriculture in various regions of the country has continuously leaped forward in the past two years proves a truth: wherever a region's Party committee can unswervingly implement the General Line, the masses in that region will be full of enthusiasm, and production will continuously leap forward. We must always remember that only with the idea of continuous leap forward can we have the drive for continuous leap forward, and only then can we achieve higher and higher yields and leaps and bounds again and again.

People may say that Suzhou Prefecture can achieve continuous high yields because of its good natural conditions. It should be admitted that Suzhou Prefecture has fertile soil, a mild climate, abundant water resources, little land and a large population, and experience in intensive cultivation, etc. These conditions are indeed better than those in many parts of our country. However, all favorable conditions can only be an objective factor in promoting increased production. What plays a decisive role in continuous leap forward is first and foremost people, people with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. In order to change water conservancy conditions, Suzhou Prefecture organized a water management army of 400,000 people last winter and this spring, digging four large trunk rivers and building five large-scale sluice dams, completing more than 110 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. This year, thanks to these newly built rivers that introduced a large amount of tidal water and replenished water sources, a particularly large harvest was achieved even in a year of severe drought. It is particularly worth mentioning that Suzhou Prefecture resolutely implemented the policy of multiple cropping, high yield, and multiple harvests, making full use of land fertility and increasing the multiple cropping index, using one mu of land as two mu. Therefore, in the case of little land and a large population, the total grain output could still increase substantially on a limited area. From this, we can see how important the people's enthusiasm is for transforming and utilizing natural conditions. It can be affirmed that if we did not hold high the victorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and establish the lofty ambition of transforming nature, if we did not have the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, could we have withstood such a severe drought by relying solely on some original favorable natural conditions? Could we have achieved the results of high yields in every season and high yields in every item? It is definitely impossible.

While giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, resolutely implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture in accordance with local conditions is another important factor for the annual high yields in Suzhou Prefecture. The "Eight-Point Charter" is the fundamental law for increasing agricultural production and the eight important measures for agricultural leap forward. The content of the "Eight-Point Charter" is constantly enriched and continuously completed, which guarantees that the yield of various crops can continue to rise. Over the past two years, in the process of implementing the "Eight-Point Charter," almost every word in Suzhou Prefecture has undergone repeated debates by the masses, repeated practice, and a more systematic summary. Therefore, it has taken root deeply in the minds of cadres and the masses.

Precisely because people have repeatedly confirmed from their own practice that the "Eight-Point Charter" is indeed a fundamental measure for increasing production, they can more reasonably apply the "Eight-Point Charter" in a way that is more suitable to local conditions. In this year's production in Suzhou Prefecture, due to fully accepting the experience from last year's implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" and combining it with farmland capital construction, the content of each measure has been newly developed in accordance with local conditions. For example, in terms of close planting, a more reasonable density under the current conditions was summarized: generally around 30,000 plants for rice, and around 30 jin for wheat sowing; in terms of fertilizer, on the basis of extensive accumulation and application last year, this year, more accumulation and clever application were implemented, and the quality was generally improved; in terms of seeds, not only were high-yield fine varieties promoted, but also the purity of fine varieties was achieved; in terms of management, it also adapted to the requirements of large-area high yields, managed early, managed carefully, managed in a balanced manner, and managed to the end. They adapted to the agricultural season and reasonably arranged crop layout. This year, they changed the habits of the past and implemented early sowing, early planting, and early management. Therefore, one early leads to all early, winning time, and creating the miracle of one season surpassing another and the later season surpassing the previous season.

Like all parts of the country, Suzhou Prefecture, under the leadership of the Party, is fighting for a continued leap forward in agriculture next year. The task before them is to advance victoriously and seize even greater high yields. Is it possible? It is entirely possible. Now they continue to boost their energy, set lofty goals, rely on the people's communes, strive for higher yields in high-yield areas, transform low-yield areas into high-yield areas, and change the imbalance between counties and counties, communes and communes, and production teams and production teams throughout the prefecture. For example, the highest single-yield of rice on a large area in the entire prefecture this year is 1,500 jin, generally 900 jin, while the lowest single-yield is only 400 to 500 jin. This situation shows that high-yield areas still contain enormous potential for increased production. If the output of general areas can reach the advanced level, each mu can increase production by 500 to 600 jin of grain, which is a huge figure.

The fact of the great harvest in Suzhou Prefecture for two years tells us that on the road to advancement, although we will encounter various difficulties, in the face of the people's communes, an organization with strong vitality, and in the face of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, all difficulties will be overcome, and form a stronger force for transforming nature and achieving higher yields.

　　苏州专区农业大丰收说明了什么
　　本报评论员
    今天本报发表的江苏省苏州专区今年粮、棉、油以及林、牧、副、渔等业全面大丰收的消息，有力地向人们证实了：一向高产的地区能够年年高产，持续跃进。
    可是，曾经有少数人对高产地区的增产潜力表示怀疑，认为高产地区的生产水平已经相当高了，再也不能跃进了；只能渐进，不能跃进。理由是高产地区基础好，基数大，不可能大幅度的增产。
    高产地区能不能不断地高产，高产更高产？苏州地区的经验告诉我们，能够。关键在于有没有共产主义者的雄心大志，有没有远大的奋斗目标，以最快的速度，最大的努力来发展生产。苏州专区所以能够在两年中连续取得大幅度的增产，最基本的一条经验，就是各级党委始终把党的多快好省的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜高高举起，用持续跃进的思想武装了人们的头脑，使广大干部和群众自始至终地保持了旺盛的革命干劲。两年来，全国各地区农业连续跃进的事实证明了一条真理：凡是哪一个地区党委能够坚定不移地贯彻总路线、哪一个地区的群众干劲就十足，生产就能不断跃进。我们必须时时刻刻记住：只有有了持续跃进的思想，才能有持续跃进的干劲，也才能出现高产更高产，跃进再跃进的局面。
    人们也许会说，苏州专区所以能连续高产，是由于他们的自然条件好。应当承认，苏州专区土质肥沃，气候温和，水源充足，地少人多，有深耕细作的经验等等，这些条件比起我国不少地区来说，确实是好一些。可是，一切有利的条件，仅仅只能是促进增产的一个客观因素。对持续跃进起决定作用的首先是人，是有着冲天革命干劲的人民。为了改变水利条件，苏州专区去冬今春曾组织了四十万人的治水大军，开挖了四条大干河，修建了五座大型闸坝，先后做了一亿一千多万土石方的工程，今年，就由于这些新建河道大量引进了江潮，补足了水源，在大旱年间仍取得了特大丰收。特别值得提一提的是苏州专区坚决贯彻了多种、高产、多收的方针，充分利用了地力，提高了复种指数，一亩地当两亩地用，因此在地少人多的情况下，仍能够在有限的面积上，使粮食总产量大幅度的增长。由此可见，人民的干劲对于改造和利用自然条件起着多么重要的作用。可以肯定，如果不是高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利旗帜，树立了改造自然的雄心大志，如果没有广大群众冲天的革命干劲，仅仅依赖于原有的一些有利的自然条件，能够抗得住这样的严重的干旱吗？能够取得季季高产、项项高产的成绩吗？肯定是不可能的。
    在充分发挥人民公社优越性和群众的革命干劲的同时，坚决地因地制宜地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”是苏州地区年年高产的另一个重要的因素。“八字宪法”是农业增产的根本大法，是农业跃进的八项重要措施，“八字宪法”的内容不断地充实，不断地完整，就保证了各项农作物的产量可以持续不断地上升。两年来，苏州专区在贯彻“八字宪法”的过程中，几乎每一个字都经过群众多次的辩论，经过反复的实践，又经过了比较系统的总结，因而在干部和群众的思想里深深扎下了根子。
    正因为人们从自己的实践中一再证实了“八字宪法”确是增产的根本措施，也就能够更加因地制宜地比较合理地运用“八字宪法”。苏州专区在今年的生产中，由于完整地接受了去年在贯彻“八字宪法”中的经验，并且和农田基本建设工作相结合，项项措施的内容都因地制宜地有了新的发展。如在密植方面总结出了目前条件下比较合理的密度，水稻一般三万棵左右，小麦播种在三十斤左右；在肥料方面，在去年广积多施的基础上，今年又实行多积、巧施，普遍提高了质量；种子方面，不但推广了高产良种，而且达到良种纯度化；管理方面也适应了大面积高产的要求，管得早、管得细、管得平衡，一管到底。他们适应农时季节，合理地安排了作物布局，今年改变了往年的习惯，实行早播、早栽、早管理，因此一早百早，赢得了时间，出现了一季超一季，后季超前季的奇迹。
    苏州专区像全国各地一样，在党的领导下，正在为明年农业继续跃进而奋战。摆在他们面前的任务是乘胜前进，再夺更大的高产。有没有可能呢？完全可能。现在他们继续鼓干劲、立大志，依靠人民公社，力争高产区更高产，低产区变高产区，改变整个专区内县与县，公社与公社，生产队与生产队之间不平衡的现象。例如全专区今年大面积的水稻最高单产是一千五百斤，一般是九百斤，而最低的单产却只四、五百斤。这种情况说明高产地区仍然蕴藏着巨大的增产潜力。如果一般地区的产量都能达到先进的水平，每亩地就可以增产五、六百斤粮食，这是何等巨大的数字。
    苏州专区两年的大丰收事实告诉我们，在前进的道路上，尽管还会遇到这样那样的困难，但是在人民公社这个有着强大生命力的组织面前，在人民群众鼓足了革命干劲的面前，一切困难都将被克服，而形成为更大的改造自然、实现更高产的坚强力量。
