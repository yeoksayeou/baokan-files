When Xing'an County, Guangxi, began raising pigs on a large scale this spring, the first difficulty encountered was the shortage of piglets. At that time, based on the spirit of "must keep the sow when seen" and "self-breeding and self-raising," the county established seventy-five simple artificial insemination stations, promoted advanced measures such as drug-induced estrus, artificial insemination, and cross-breeding, eliminated the phenomenon of non-pregnancy, and increased the number of piglets born per sow from an average of five to seven or eight.

In order to further select and breed good breeds of pigs, the following methods of eliminating the inferior and preserving the superior were adopted: First, from the county and commune to the production brigade, good breed breeding farms were established to specialize in cultivating excellent pig breeds to improve the quality of pigs. According to the experiment of Rongjiang Pig Farm, mating a sow weighing forty jin will produce four to six piglets per litter, each piglet weighing four to eight jin (calculated at one month old, the same below); a sow weighing eighty jin will produce eight to twelve piglets, each piglet weighing about fifteen jin; a sow weighing one hundred jin will produce at least twelve piglets per litter, each piglet weighing about twenty-five jin. The larger the piglets, the higher the survival rate. Second, the method of distant mating was also adopted, so that the piglets born grew larger and stronger than those from close mating. Third, the best local breeds and introduced foreign breeds of pigs were selected for cultivation. After adopting these methods, the county now has 20,000 sows of better quality.

　　去劣存优　选育良种
    广西兴安县今春开始大量养猪时，首先遇到的困难就是仔猪不够。当时根据见母必留，自繁自养的精神，全县建立了七十五个简易人工授精站，推广药物催情、人工授精、复配等先进措施，消灭了空怀现象，母猪产仔由平均每胎五头提高到七、八头。
    为了进一步选育良种猪，采取以下去劣存优的办法：首先，从县、公社到生产大队都建立了良种繁殖场，专门培选优良猪种，以提高猪的质量。根据溶江猪场的试验，以四十斤重的母猪配种，每胎产仔四至六头，每头仔猪重四至八斤（以满月计算，下同）；母猪体重八十斤的，产仔猪八至十二头，每头仔猪十五斤左右；一百斤重的母猪，每胎至少产仔猪十二头，每头子猪二十五斤左右。仔猪越大，成活率越高。其次，还采取远交远配的办法，这样生下来的仔猪，比近交近配的长得大而壮。第三，选择本地最好良种和引进外地良种猪加以培育。采取这些方法之后，现在全县已有较好的母猪二万头。
