    A Construction Site Factory Serving Water Conservancy Construction
    Tian Yuhua
    In order to support water conservancy construction, the Shishan Agricultural Implement Factory of Shishan Commune in Echeng County, Hubei Province, established a construction site repair and manufacturing plant at the Shishan pumping station construction site. This factory has a total of seventeen people, including three workshops, divided into five types of work: carpentry, metalwork, bamboo weaving, machinery and钳工 (I believe this refers to mechanics or machinists), and earthwork. By adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and relying on the masses, they have achieved great success in their work. From November 2nd to 24th, in just over twenty days, the factory trial-produced and improved fifteen kinds of tools, so that all processes from excavation to compaction on this construction site basically used improved tools such as walking plows, soil-lifting machines, drilling machines, 滑丝 (likely refers to a pulley or similar device), ox-drawn soil transport vehicles, belt conveyors, pile drivers, jib cranes, soil crushing and leveling machines, and thousand-catty animal-powered soil compacting rollers. This achieved "three eliminations": eliminating digging hoes, eliminating carrying poles, and eliminating flying 硪 (a type of ramming tool). This greatly reduced the labor intensity of the workers and improved labor efficiency. Work efficiency increased by an average of 7.8 times, greatly reducing the labor force and time required for the project. The original plan was for the entire project to require 170,000 standard workdays, with an average of 2,000 people working each day, and would take three and a half months to complete. Now, an average of only 600 people work each day. From November 5th to 20th, in just half a month, 70% of the entire project has been completed, saving more than 21,000 workdays. Now, the Echeng County Committee is holding an on-site meeting at this construction site to promote the experience of this construction site factory.
    Who Says a Factory Can't Be Built at a Construction Site?
    At the beginning of establishing the construction site factory and carrying out the tool reform movement, conservative ideas existed in the minds of some cadres. They believed that running a construction site factory was "thankless," saying that construction sites were in the wilderness, lacking everything, and it was not easy to carry out tool reform; that construction sites were narrow and steep, and improved tools could not be used, and that the workers were "fated" to carry poles. In response to this situation, the commune party committee put forward the slogan of "sweep away conservative ideas, fiercely attack the theory of conditions, establish construction site factories, and vigorously engage in technical innovation," and carried out rectification at the construction site. A large-scale debate was held on the topic of whether or not to establish construction site factories and whether or not to carry out technical innovation. The fact that an electric pile driver had already been manufactured, increasing work efficiency by 25 to 30 times compared to manual labor, was presented, giving a severe blow to conservative ideas. At the same time, the commune party committee strengthened its leadership over the construction site factory. In addition to the commune party committee member stationed at the construction site concurrently managing this work, the secretary of the construction site party branch was specifically responsible for the work of this factory. In addition, cadres were mobilized to take the lead in experiments and set examples to motivate the masses. Huang Zhicheng, the director of the construction site factory, worked with the workers to research, trial-produce, and successfully imitate more than ten kinds of tools. In order to rush to manufacture electric pile drivers and belt conveyors, he worked day and night, and refused to rest even when others advised him to. His exemplary actions motivated the masses, and a high tide of everyone enthusiastically engaging in technical innovation quickly emerged.
    Adapting Tools to Needs Through Reform
    In the tool reform, the construction site factory closely followed the needs of the project, ensuring that tool reform went wherever the project progressed, and reforming whatever tools were needed according to the terrain characteristics. For example, when clearing the base and leveling the ground, they vigorously reformed leveling and compacting tools; when the project turned to building the inlet pool, they focused on reforming soil extraction and transportation tools; when building the reservoir, because the slopes were high and the roads were slippery, it was difficult to transport soil up and down, and work efficiency was very low. At a distance of less than 20 meters, one person could only transport 0.85 cubic meters of soil per day. Therefore, the construction site factory manufactured a sloping belt conveyor, which could transport 125 loads of soil per minute, increasing work efficiency by 39 times compared to manual soil transportation.
    While doing a good job in tool reform, the construction site factory also fixed three iron and woodworking workers to patrol the construction site with tools and parts to repair the tools, ensuring that they were repaired when broken and patched when torn. One day, the belt conveyor broke down, and it was repaired in less than five minutes. From the start of the project to now, the construction site factory has repaired a total of 892 various tools, extending the life of the tools, giving full play to the role of improved tools, and achieving a tool integrity rate of 98%, meeting the needs of the project.
        Making a Template for Comprehensive Promotion
    It is not enough for just a dozen people in the construction site factory to manufacture tools to meet the needs of the entire project. Therefore, the construction site factory made a template and launched the masses to imitate it through on-site meetings, promoting it comprehensively. In order to facilitate imitation by the masses, the tools manufactured by the construction site factory are relatively simple and easy to manufacture. For example, the various types of automatic unloading vehicles they manufacture, such as those with no wheels, two wheels, three wheels, and four wheels, are very simple in structure, use few materials, have low costs, and produce quick results. Taking the unwheeled automatic unloading vehicle as an example, it only requires making a hopper-shaped box and installing an arched wooden bracket, costing only 8.9 yuan, and can carry 500 to 600 catties, increasing work efficiency by five times compared to manual soil transportation. After the on-site meeting was held on November 22nd, it was promoted throughout the construction site.
        Combining Fixed Personnel and Raids
    In addition to fixing a certain number of workers to be stationed at the construction site factory, the commune agricultural implement factory sends people to reinforce and carry out raids when there are urgent tasks. For example, the installation of the belt conveyor involved a large workload and was time-sensitive, so the agricultural implement factory promptly extracted 18 ironworkers, carpenters, and machinists to support the construction site factory. The belt conveyor was fully installed in one night, saving time and speeding up the water conservancy project. On November 24th, the construction site headquarters arranged for the construction site factory to complete 40 handcarts in one day to ensure the needs of the project. It would be difficult for just the few carpenters at the construction site factory to complete this task. Therefore, the commune agricultural implement factory promptly sent people to support, and all the handcarts were completed on time, with quality, and in quantity in less than a day.

    为水利建设服务的一个工地工厂
    田玉华
    湖北鄂城县石山公社农具厂为了支援水利建设，在石山抽水机站工地设立了一个工地修配制造厂。这个厂共有十七个人，包括三个车间，分为木器、铁器、篾器、机钳、泥石五个工种，由于坚持了政治挂帅，依靠群众，在工作上取得了很大的成绩。在11月2日到24日二十多天中，这个工厂共试制和改良工具十五种，使这个工地从挖土到碾压全部工序基本上都使用了步犁、起土机、钻石机、滑丝、群牛运土车、皮带运输机、打硪机、吊杆起重机、碎土平土机和千斤畜力压土磙等改良工具，实现了“三丢”：丢挖锄、丢扁担、丢飞硪。这样就大大减轻了民工的劳动强度，提高了劳动效率，工效平均提高了七点八倍，使工程需要的劳动力和时间大大减少。原计划整个工程需要十七万个标准工，平均每天二千人出工，需要三个半月才能建成；现在平均每天只有六百人出工，从11月5日起到20日止，仅半个月时间全部工程已完成了70％，节省劳动日二万一千多个。现在鄂城县委在这个工地召开了现场会，推广这个工地工厂的经验。
    谁说工地不能建工厂
    在开始建立工地工厂、开展工具改革运动时，在某些干部的思想上存在着保守思想。他们认为办工地工厂是“吃力不讨好”，说什么工地荒野，要啥没啥，不好搞工具改革；工地窄小，坡度高，改良的工具也用不上，只有挑扁担的“命”。针对这种情况，公社党委提出了“横扫保守思想，猛攻唯条件论，建立工地工厂，大闹技术革新”的口号，开展了工地整风，以能不能建立工地工厂、要不要技术革新为题进行了大辩论，并摆出已经制成电动打硪机比人工提高工效二十五倍到三十倍的事实，给保守思想以严重打击。同时，公社党委加强了对工地工厂的领导，除驻工地公社党委委员兼管这项工作外，并由工地党支部书记专抓这个厂的工作。另外，还动员干部带头搞试验、树榜样，带动群众。工地工厂厂长黄志成和工人共同研究，试制和仿制成功十多种工具。他为了赶制电动打硪机和皮带运输机，日夜苦战，别人劝他休息他不休息。他的这种模范行动带动了群众，很快出现了一个人人热心搞技术革新的高潮。
    适应需要改革工具
    工地工厂在工具改革中，紧紧地根据工程需要，做到了工程进展到哪里，工具改革到哪里，并且按照地势特点需要什么工具，就改革什么工具。如清基平基时，就大搞平土和压土工具改革；当工程转入修建进水池时，就着重改革取土和运输工具；在修建蓄水池时，由于坡高路滑，运土上下困难，工效很低，在距离不到二十米的地方，一人一天只能运土零点八五立方，于是工地工厂就制成一部斜坡皮带运输机，一分钟可运土一百二十五担，比人工运土提高工效三十九倍。
    在作好工具改革的同时，工地工厂还固定了三个铁木工人带着工具、零件在工地巡逻，作工具的维修工作，做到坏了就修，破了就补。有一天，皮带运输机坏了，在不到五分钟的时间内就修好了。从工程开工到现在，工地工厂共修理了各种工具八百九十二件，延长了工具寿命，充分发挥了改良工具的作用，工具完好率达98％，满足了工程需要。
          作出样板全面推广
    仅仅工地工厂的十几个人制造工具，是不能满足整个工程需要的。于是工地工厂就作出样板，通过现场会发动民工仿制，全面推广。为了便于群众仿制，工地工厂制造的工具都比较简单易造。如他们制造的无轮、双轮、三轮、四轮等各式的自动卸土车，构造都很简单，用料少，成本低，收效快。以无轮自动卸土车为例，只要做一个戽形车箱，装上一个弓形木托架就成，造价只要八元九角，可载重五百到六百斤，比人工运土提高工效五倍。在11月22日开了现场会后，就在全工地推广开了。
        固定人员和突击结合
    公社农具厂除了固定一定数量的工人专驻工地工厂外，有紧急任务时，就派人增援，进行突击。如安装皮带运输机，工作量大，时间紧迫，农具厂就及时抽出十八名铁木工、车钳工支援工地工厂，一个晚上就把皮带运输机全部安装成功，争取了时间，加快了水利工程的速度。11月24日，工地指挥部安排工地工厂在一天时间内完成手推车四十部，保证工程的需要。这个任务仅靠工地工厂的几个木工很难完成，于是公社农具厂及时派人支援，不到一天时间，全部手推车按时、按质、按量完成。
