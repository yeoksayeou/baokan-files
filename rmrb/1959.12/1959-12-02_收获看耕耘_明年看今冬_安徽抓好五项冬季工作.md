    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 1st. Anhui Province is focusing on winter water conservancy construction, combined with field management, fertilizer accumulation and production, soil improvement, and deep plowing – the "Five Winters" campaign. It has started with great momentum, rapid action, and high efficiency.
    Zhang Youdao Youth Shock Brigade of Su County, a famous water management pacesetter in the province, has been using advanced tools for all its construction. For over half a month, each person has been moving over twenty-eight cubic meters of earthwork per day. In Fuyang County, 220,000 water conservancy workers on the river network transformation sites have been achieving an average daily efficiency of 14.5 cubic meters per person. Since late November, the average daily efficiency of water conservancy workers across the province has been about 40% higher than the average daily efficiency last year.
    This autumn, Anhui Province has sown a larger area of grain and oil crops than last year, and wheat and rapeseed are already green. In terms of winter field management, more than 110,000 specialized teams composed of more than 2.1 million people across the province have applied fertilizer to more than 11 million mu of summer harvest crops. 1.2 million mu have been combined with weeding and cultivation, covering with ash manure and weeds to keep them warm and prevent freezing. Replenishment has been completed for 4.1 million mu of wheat and rapeseed fields with missing seedlings.
    This winter's fertilizer accumulation campaign in Anhui Province also started early and on a large scale. All localities are especially focusing on accumulating other livestock and poultry manure while developing pig raising for fertilizer accumulation; using winter fallow fields to plant green manure; using gaps, barren slopes, and lake beaches to plant perennial green manure; accumulating various local miscellaneous fertilizers and building fertilizer cellars in the fields to compost manure; and producing local chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers. In less than twenty days, the province accumulated more than 3 billion dan of various fertilizers and produced more than 5 million dan of local chemical fertilizers.
    Under the slogan of "Don't leave a single hardened field for the winter," farmers in various parts of Anhui Province have also been carrying out winter plowing and deep plowing of land early this winter, combined with soil improvement and the prevention of underground pests. According to statistics from Fuyang, Bengbu, Lu'an, and Wuhu, more than 400,000 laborers are invested in winter plowing and deep plowing every day, and more than 6.7 million mu of hardened winter fields have been plowed. The Zhufuo'an People's Commune has widely carried out cooperation between production teams with fewer fields but more cattle and production teams with more fields but fewer cattle. More than 110,000 mu of winter hardened fields in the county have been deep plowed. The Zhufuo'an Commune organized cooperation between production teams on the mountain and at the foot of the mountain, and the whole commune completed the deep plowing of 36,600 mu of fields ten days ahead of schedule, and the depth was around eight inches. Chuxian County has grasped winter plowing work early, and more than 70% of the winter fallow fields have been plowed, and some have also been watered and overwintered to eliminate rice borers and improve the soil. Lu'an Prefecture combined winter plowing to improve more than 11,700 mu of soil. Pond mud was added to cold water fields with deep mud feet or short-term green manure was planted to promote soil improvement. In Xiao County, which has barren soil and a lot of saline-alkali land, a command headquarters for improving alkaline land has also been specially established, and more than 80,000 people have been drawn to carry out large-scale soil improvement work using methods such as alkali removal, alkali washing, deep plowing to exchange soil, and increasing the application of organic fertilizer.

    收获看耕耘　明年看今冬
    安徽抓好五项冬季工作
    以兴修水利为中心，作好积肥造
    肥田间管理深翻和改良土壤工作
    新华社合肥1日电　安徽省以冬修水利为中心的冬季田间管理、积肥造肥、改良土壤、深翻土地等“五冬”工作，一开头就劲头大，行动快，效率高。
    全省著名的治水标兵——宿县张友道青年突击队，由于全部使用先进工具施工，半个多月来，每人每天做土方二十八立方米以上。阜阳县战斗在河网化工地上的二十二万治水民工，平均每人每天工效达到十四点五立方米。进入11月下旬以来，全省冬修水利的民工平均日工效，比去年平均日工效高40％左右。
    安徽省今年秋种的粮食和油料作物面积比去年大，麦子、油菜已一片青绿。在冬季田间管理方面，全省由二百一十多万人组成的十一万多个专业队，已给一千一百多万亩夏收作物追了肥，有一百二十万亩结合中耕除草，加盖了灰粪杂草，保温防冻，四百一十万亩缺苗的麦田和油菜田，都已补齐。
    今冬安徽省的积肥运动也动手早、规模大。各地特别重视在发展养猪积肥的同时，大量积聚其他家畜家禽粪；利用冬闲田种绿肥；利用隙地、荒坡和湖滩，种植多年生绿肥；积攒各种土杂肥和田头建肥窖沤肥；就地取材大制土化肥和细菌肥料。全省不到二十天，就积攒了各种肥料三十多亿担，制造土化肥五百多万担。
    在“不留一块板田过冬”的口号下，今冬安徽省各地农民还结合改良土壤和防治地下虫害，提早进行了冬耕和深翻土地。据阜阳、蚌埠、六安、芜湖四个专区统计，每天投入冬耕深翻的劳动力有四十多万个，已翻犁过冬板田六百七十多万亩。霍山人民公社广泛开展田少牛多和田多牛少的生产队之间的协作，全县已有十一万多亩冬板田深翻过。诸佛庵公社组织山头上与山脚下的生产队互相协作，全社三万六千六百亩田提前十天完成了深翻任务，而且深度都在八寸上下。滁县冬耕工作抓得早，70％以上的冬闲田都已犁过，有的还通过灌水冬沤，消灭螟虫，改良土壤。六安专区结合冬耕改良土壤一万一千七百多亩。泥脚深的冷水田，都增施了塘泥或种了短期绿肥，以促进土性改良。土质瘠薄、盐碱地多的萧县，还专门成立了改良碱地指挥部，抽出八万多人用起碱、洗碱、深翻换土和增施有机肥料等办法，大规模进行土壤改良工作。
