    People's communes are the new foundation for water conservancy movements, bringing many new characteristics to these movements: they facilitate the undertaking of larger backbone projects, integrating large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects; they facilitate the connection of previously scattered and isolated projects, forming a relatively complete irrigation and drainage system; they facilitate the integration of major river management with the planning and comprehensive development of entire small and medium-sized river basins; they facilitate the unified allocation of labor, the organization of large-scale collaboration and large-scale battles, under the principles of mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and equivalent exchange; they facilitate the unified allocation of water sources, the implementation of planned water use, the strengthening of irrigation management, and the realization of garden-style farming, etc. Therefore, it is essential to fully utilize and leverage the superior conditions of the people's communes to carry out the water conservancy movement this winter and next spring, and to plan and organize future water conservancy construction based on the aforementioned new characteristics, taking a step forward on the existing foundation.

    人民公社是水利运动的新基础，给水利运动带来很多新的特点：它便于举办较大的骨干工程，使大中小型水利工程结合起来；它便于把过去分散的孤立的工程联结起来，形成一个比较完整的灌溉排水系统；它便于结合大江大河的治理，进行中小河流全流域的规划和综合开发；它便于在互助互利和等价交换的原则下，统一调配劳力，组织大协作和大兵团作战；它便于统一调配水源，推行计划用水，加强灌溉管理，实现园田化等等。因此，必须充分利用和发挥人民公社的优越条件，开展今冬明春的水利运动，并且根据上述新的特点，规划和组织今后的水利建设，在现有基础上提高一步。
