　　Tremendous Changes on the Grassland
　　Comprehensive Development of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry in the Heka People's Commune, Qinghai

　　The Heka People's Commune in the pastoral area of ​​Xinghai County, Qinghai, was established on September 7, 1958. The entire commune has 471 households, 2,113 people, and 1,173 laborers, including Han, Tibetan, and Hui nationalities, with Tibetans accounting for the majority, 89.5% of the total population. The grassland area is approximately 2.7 million mu, belonging to two pastoral brigades and one agricultural brigade. The commune has flat terrain, a mild climate, abundant forage grass, and rich resources, making it a good place for animal husbandry, agriculture, and diversified operations.

　　After liberation, production and living standards here have greatly improved; however, it was not until the people's commune was established that people could move more quickly towards a happy life on this rich and beautiful grassland. Let us look at the earth-shaking changes in the year since communization!

　　Animal Husbandry Gallops Ahead

　　After the establishment of the commune, the grassland was first more rationally planned and used, allowing animal husbandry to gallop ahead. During the cooperative period, although the grassland had been initially planned, due to the limitations of the cooperative boundaries, adjustments could only be made reasonably within the cooperative's scope, and the historically inherited irrational phenomena could not be completely resolved. The grassland occupied by each cooperative varied in size and quality. Cooperatives with poor and small grasslands could not provide sufficient forage for their livestock; cooperatives occupying good grass and water could not consume all of their forage. At the same time, each cooperative had only one winter pasture and one summer pasture. After the summer pasture was depleted in August each year, the livestock from each cooperative crowded onto the Heka beach with the best water and grass, trampling and wasting it while grazing, making winter forage a problem. After the establishment of the commune, the original cooperative boundaries were broken, the grassland was uniformly planned, the use of the grasslands was rationalized, autumn pastures were added, and two-season rotational grazing was changed to three-season rotational grazing (summer, autumn, and winter-spring), eliminating the phenomenon of抢牧 (qiang mu - "grabbing" grazing),乱牧 (luan mu - chaotic grazing), and avoiding the crowding of livestock from various cooperatives trampling and wasting forage. The commune also further improved the grassland. The entire commune mobilized its labor force to build 19 irrigation canals, totaling 70 li in length, dig 5 wells, excavate more than 100 springs, and build 5 ponds, which can irrigate 8,800 mu of grassland and 2,100 mu of farmland, solving the water shortage problem that had not been solved for thousands of years. After being irrigated, the grassland's forage grass grew even more luxuriantly. In 1959, the height of the forage grass was 85% to 93% higher than in 1957, and the grass yield increased by 1.7 times. On these irrigated grasslands, more than 30 kinds of high-quality forage grasses such as alfalfa, sweet clover, oats, timothy, clover, and couch grass were also tried and grew very well.

　　The feeding and management of livestock were also greatly improved after the commune. During the cooperative period, due to the small size of the cooperatives and the small number of livestock, it was not possible to rationally group them, and most were grazed in mixed groups, affecting the breeding and fattening of livestock. After the establishment of the commune, there were more livestock, and they were rationally grouped. Ewes were grouped in groups of 300, rams in groups of 500, cattle in groups of 80 to 100, horses in groups of 100 to 150, and crossbred improved sheep were also grouped separately. The commune selected herders with high awareness and grazing experience to graze livestock on a fixed basis, and implemented a system of contracting for work and production, and rewarding overproduction. In this way, the livestock herds were finely divided, feeding and management were meticulous, fattening was well-grasped, and the breeding survival rate was high.

　　While improving the feeding and management of livestock, the commune also vigorously carried out the work of building sheds and pens and cutting grass for supplementary feeding. Within a year, a total of 219 new sheds and pens were built. Together with the existing sheds and pens, every livestock now has a pen, and lambs and some young livestock have sheds, making it easier to protect against wind, cold, wolves, and loss. Over the past year, 3.88 million jin of forage grass has been cut and stored, exceeding the total amount of forage grass cut and stored in all previous years after liberation, and increasing by 22.3 times compared to the 1958 fiscal year (July 1, 1957 to June 30, 1958). Adding the 750,000 jin of crop straw from last year, each of the commune's 4,500 old, weak, and young livestock can receive an average of more than 1,000 jin of supplementary forage grass.

　　After communization, livestock breed improvement and veterinary epidemic prevention work were also rapidly promoted and developed. In the summer of 1959, Xinjiang sheep were used to breed 17,000 ewes, and "Altan" stallions were used to breed 57 mares. All livestock in the commune were given two preventive injections, and sheep were given medicinal baths, reducing the incidence of livestock diseases. Cow plague has now been eliminated, and infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and anthrax have been controlled.

　　Due to the commune's ample funds, a large number of new agricultural tools were purchased, changing the extremely backward state of agricultural tools in the past. The commune purchased three horse-drawn lawn mowers, ten disc harrows, ten tine harrows, two horse-drawn harvesters, four horse-drawn seeders, and 77 five-inch and swivel plows, and trained technicians to operate these tools. After these agricultural and pastoral machines were put into production, they played a huge role in reducing the labor intensity of commune members, saving labor, and improving production efficiency.

　　The rational planning, use, and improvement of grasslands, the improvement of livestock feeding and management, the strengthening of veterinary epidemic prevention work, and the use of new tools have promoted the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. According to statistics in September 1959, the total number of livestock in the commune had reached 85,709, a net increase of 46.9% compared to the 1958 fiscal year before communization, and a net increase of 1.9 times compared to 1949. Such a rate of development has never been seen in history.

　　Basic Self-Sufficiency in Grain

　　The grain eaten by herdsmen in the Heka area has always relied on supplies from other places. In 1957, the two pilot cooperatives began planting 105 mu of crops. Although agriculture developed greatly in 1958, the yield was low and it was still not self-sufficient. Failure to solve the grain problem is detrimental to the rapid development of animal husbandry production. In order to completely solve this problem, the commune put forward the bold slogan of "grain self-sufficiency" in 1959, which was enthusiastically supported by the commune members. 2,337 mu of wasteland was reclaimed, and together with the original cultivated land, there were a total of 6,207 mu. 5,412 mu were planted with various crops such as highland barley, wheat, and rapeseed, so that the total grain output reached 638,984 jin, an increase of 47.5% compared to 1957, with an average of 302 jin of grain per person, basically achieving grain self-sufficiency.

　　Having Its Own Industry

　　Building industry on the grasslands was unimaginable before liberation. Before the establishment of the commune, some cooperatives had considered setting up some small factories, but they could not spare labor, the technical forces could not be resolved, and there were difficulties with funds, so the wish was not realized. After the establishment of the commune, these problems were resolved, and eight small factories were set up for agricultural and pastoral machinery repair, fur processing, leather making, livestock product processing, mixed fertilizers, medicines, bricks and tiles, lime, and sewing. A new era of industry has begun on the Heka Grassland, and locally produced industrial products have begun to emerge. These eight factories have 56 long-term workers, including 24 ethnic minority workers (18 Tibetans), and have trained 9 Tibetan technicians.

　　Living Beyond Prosperous Herdsmen

　　With the great development of production, the income of commune members has continued to increase. It is estimated that the total income of the commune in 1959 will be 600,000 yuan (500,000 yuan has been received by mid-September). After deducting production costs and 270,000 yuan of commune accumulation, the average income per laborer is 281 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen, an increase of 70.8% compared to 1958.

　　Due to the increase in income, the lives of commune members have undergone great changes, exceeding the living standards of prosperous herdsmen in the local area. In the past, many herdsmen wore only one tattered old sheepskin coat all year round. Now, in addition to having a good old sheepskin coat, 70% of the commune members have also purchased lambskin coats. Most commune members have bought rubber shoes and raincoats, and commune members generally have flashlights, thermos bottles, boxes, and other daily necessities.

　　The commune built 273 new earthen houses within a year, and 75 commune member households have moved into new houses. They say: Earthen houses are much better than tents, sheltering from wind and snow and keeping warm. In order to allow everyone to live in earthen houses, construction is still continuing, and it is planned to achieve full settlement and grazing next year, ending the backward nomadic life of herdsmen chasing water and grass for thousands of years forever.

　　Before communization, there were only two primary schools here, and all tuition and food expenses were provided by the state, but there were only 17 students. Except for the lamas in the temples, almost all herdsmen were illiterate. Now there are four primary schools (including one complete primary school), and students pay all their own expenses, but the number of enrolled children has increased to 224, accounting for 90% of school-age children. The commune has also organized 28 literacy classes and 29 newspaper reading groups. The enthusiasm of young and middle-aged herdsmen to learn culture is very high. In terms of health care, the original people's hospital has been expanded and three health stations have been established. There are now 38 medical personnel (including 28 who are not detached from production), 37 midwives and health workers. In the past, herdsmen had no scientific knowledge and recited scriptures and divined when they were sick; now commune members ask doctors when they are sick. A folk song circulating among the masses says: "It's hard to fill your stomach without eating, and how can you get better without taking medicine." The mortality rate of adults and infants has been greatly reduced, and the appearance of environmental and personal hygiene has also been completely renewed. These are all groundbreaking events in pastoral areas.

　　New Type of Ethnic Relations

　　Everywhere in production, one can see the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and selfless labor attitude of commune members. For example, in early September this year, in order to achieve bumper harvests, the male and female commune members of the Heka Brigade, led by the commune secretary, were all mobilized and harvested 800 mu of crops within three days. The same is true for打圈 (da quan - building fences); the entire commune built 115 fences within a month. Herder Gengjia took very careful care of the flock of goats. The survival rate of the 172 lambs born to the flock she herded reached 98.3%.

　　Socialist ethnic relations have been further consolidated and developed, and the unity within ethnic groups and between ethnic groups has been unprecedentedly strengthened. In the past, due to the incitement of feudal rulers, the masses of the Shenwu tribe and the Aquhu tribe did not speak to each other, and even kinship was severed, and sometimes they even killed and fought each other. Now, in a commune, working and living together, people have established new relations of mutual assistance and friendship. For example, in the work of reclaiming wasteland and sowing seeds, Han and Hui commune members teach Tibetan commune members agricultural production techniques, and Tibetan commune members teach Han commune members the experience of livestock feeding and management, learning from each other, learning from each other's strengths, and respecting each other's customs and habits. Many commune members said: "Now we have truly achieved ethnic equality and unity."

    草原巨变
    青海河卡人民公社农牧业全面发展
    青海兴海县牧业区的河卡人民公社，成立于1958年9月7日。全社四百七十一户，二千一百一十三人，一千一百七十三个劳动力，包括汉、藏、回三个民族，藏族居多，占总人口的89.5％。草原面积约二百七十余万亩，分别属于两个牧业大队和一个农业大队。社内地势平坦，气候温和，牧草丰美，资源丰富，是一个宜牧、宜农、宜于发展多种经营的好地方。
    解放后，这里的生产生活有了很大的提高；但是直到人民公社化后，人们才有可能在这块富饶美丽的草原上，更快地走向幸福的生活。让我们看看公社化一年间翻天复地的变化吧！
    畜牧业跨上千里马
    公社成立以后，首先是草原得到了更加合理的规划和使用，使畜牧业跨上了千里马。合作社时期，草原虽然也进行了初步的规划，但是由于社界的限制，只能在本社范围内合理调整，对于历史上遗留下来的不合理现象，不能彻底解决。原来各个合作社占有的草原大小、好坏不一，草原不好和过小的合作社，牲畜吃不到足够的饲草；占有好草、好水的合作社，饲草却吃不完。同时，每个社只有一个冬季草场、一个夏季草场，每年8月夏季草场的草吃完以后，各社的牲畜都挤到水草最好的河卡滩上，连吃带踏糟蹋，冬季饲草就成了问题。公社成立以后，打破了原有的社界，统一规划了草原，合理使用了草山，增辟了秋季草场，改两季轮牧为夏、秋、冬春三季轮牧，根绝了抢牧、乱牧和避免了各社牲畜挤到一块儿糟蹋浪费饲草的现象。公社还进一步改良了草原，全社劳动力总动员，修起水渠十九条，全长七十华里，打井五眼，挖泉一百多个，修池五个，可以灌溉草原八千八百亩，农田二千一百亩，解决了千百年来没有解决的缺水问题。被灌溉后的草原，牧草长得更加丰美。1959年牧草株身比1957年高85％到93％，产草量增加一点七倍。在这些灌溉了的草原上，还试种了苜蓿、草木樨、燕麦、牛尾草、三叶草、莞根等三十多种优良牧草，生长得都很好。
    牲畜的饲养管理，在公社以后也得到大大改善。合作社时期，由于社小、牲畜少，不能合理编群，多是混群放牧，影响牲畜的繁殖、增膘。公社建立后，牲畜多了，合理编了群。母羊三百只一群，公羊五百只一群，牛八十至一百头一群，马一百至一百五十匹一群，杂交改良的绵羊也另外组群。公社选择了觉悟高、有放牧经验的牧民，固定放牧牲畜，并实行了包工包产和超产奖励的办法。这样就做到了畜群分得精，饲养管理细，膘抓得好，繁殖成活率高。
    在改善牲畜饲放管理的同时，公社还大力开展了修棚打圈和割草补饲的工作。一年内共新修圈棚二百十九个，连同原有的圈棚，已经实现了畜畜有圈，接羔和部分幼畜有棚，便于防风、防冻、防狼、防丢失。一年来，割贮饲草三百八十八万斤，超过了解放后历年来割贮饲草的总和，比1958年度（1957年7月1日至1958年6月30日）增加了二十二点三倍，加上去年庄稼草七十五万斤，全社四千五百头老弱母幼牲畜平均每头可得到补助饲草一千多斤。
    公社化后，畜种改良和兽疫防治工作也得到了迅速的推广和发展。1959年夏季就用新疆羊配了一万七千只母绵羊，用“阿尔登”种马配了母马五十七匹。全社牲畜进行了两次预防注射，绵羊进行了药浴，减少了牲畜疫病的发生，现在已消灭了牛瘟，控制了口蹄疫、炭疽等传染病。
    由于公社资金充足，购买了大批新式生产工具，改变了以往生产工具极端落后的状态。公社购置了马拉割草机三台、圆盘耙十台、丁字耙十台、马拉收割机两台、马拉播种机四台、五寸和转头步犁七十七部，并且培养了操作这些工具的技术人员。这些农牧机械投入生产以后，对减轻社员的劳动强度、节省劳动力、提高生产效率，起了巨大的作用。
    草原的合理规划、使用和改良，牲畜饲养管理的改善，兽疫防治工作的加强，以及新式工具的使用，促进了畜牧业生产的高速度发展。根据1959年9月的统计，全社各种牲畜已发展到八万五千七百零九头，比公社化前的1958年度净增46.9％，比1949年净增一点九倍。这样的发展速度是历史上没有过的。
    基本实现粮食自给
    河卡地区牧民吃的粮食，历来都靠外地供应。1957年试办的两个合作社开始种了一百零五亩庄稼，1958年农业虽有很大发展，但是产量少，仍不能自给。粮食问题得不到解决，对畜牧业生产的迅速发展是不利的。公社为了彻底解决这个问题，1959年提出“粮食自给”的豪迈口号，得到了社员的热烈拥护，开出荒地二千三百三十七亩，连原有耕地共六千二百零七亩，种植了青稞、小麦、油菜等各种农作物五千四百十二亩，使粮食总产量达到六十三万八千九百八十四斤，比1957年增长47.5％，每人平均占有粮食三百零二斤，基本上实现了粮食自给。
    有了自己的工业
    草原上办工业，解放前想都不敢想。公社成立前，有的合作社虽然曾经设想过办一些小型工厂，但抽不出劳动力，技术力量得不到解决，资金也有困难，愿望没有实现。公社成立后，这些问题得到了解决，办起了农牧机具修配、皮毛加工、制革、畜产品加工、混合肥料、药品、砖瓦、石灰、缝纫等小型工厂八个。河卡草原上开辟了工业的新纪元，开始有了当地生产的工业品。这八个厂有长期工人五十六人，其中有少数民族工人二十四名（藏民十八名），培养出藏族技工九人。
    超过富裕牧民的生活
    随着生产的大发展，社员的收入不断增加。1959年预计全社共收入六十万元（9月中旬已收入五十万元），扣除生产费用和公社积累二十七万元，每个劳动力平均收入二百八十一元三角三分，比1958年增长70.8％。
    由于收入的增加，社员们的生活起了很大的变化，已经超过当地富裕牧民的生活水平。过去许多牧民一年四季穿的就是一件破烂的老羊皮袄，现在除每人都有一件好的老羊皮袄外，70％的社员还添置了羔皮袄。大部分社员买了胶鞋和雨衣，社员们普遍有了手电筒和热水瓶、箱子等日用品。
    公社在一年内新建土房二百七十三间，已有七十五户社员搬进了新房。他们说：土房比帐房好的多，又避风雪又暖和。为了使大家都住上土房，现在还在继续修建，计划明年实现全部定居放牧，永远结束牧民千百年来追逐水草而居的落后的游牧生活。
    公社化以前，这里只有两所小学，学杂费和伙食费全由国家供给，但是只有学生十七人，除了寺院的喇嘛外，一般牧民几乎全是文盲。现在已经有了四所小学（内有完全小学一所），学生全部自费，而入学儿童却增加到二百二十四人，占到学龄儿童的90％。全社还组织了二十八个识字班，二十九个读报组，青壮年牧民学习文化的热情很高。在卫生保健事业上，扩大了原有的人民医院，建立了三个保健站。现在有医务人员三十八名（内不脱产的二十八名），接生员和保健员三十七名。过去牧民没有科学知识，有病就念经算卦；现在社员有病请医生，群众中流传着这样一句歌谣：“不吃饭肚难饱，不吃药病咋好。”成年人和婴儿的死亡率大大降低，环境卫生和个人卫生面貌也焕然一新。这些在牧业区来说，都是破天荒的大事情。
    新型的民族关系
    生产中到处可以看到社员们冲天的革命干劲和忘我的劳动态度。例如，在今年9月初，为了实现丰产丰收，在公社书记的率领下，河卡大队的男女社员全部出动，三天之内割完庄稼八百亩。打圈也是一样，全社在一个月的时间内就打圈一百十五个。放牧员根加非常细心地看管着羊群，她放牧的那群山羊所生的一百七十二只羊羔的成活率达到了98.3％。
    社会主义的民族关系，有了进一步的巩固和发展，民族内部和各民族之间的团结，得到了空前的加强。过去申吾部落和阿曲乎部落的群众由于封建统治者的挑拨离间，互不说话，连亲戚关系都断绝了，有时甚至互相仇杀、械斗。现在，在一个公社中，共同劳动，共同生活，人们之间建立了新的互助友好的关系。比如，在开荒播种工作中，汉族、回族社员给藏族社员教农业生产技术，藏族社员则教给汉族社员牲畜饲养管理的经验，互相学习，取长补短，互相尊重对方的风俗习惯。许多社员说：现在才真正做到了民族平等团结”。
