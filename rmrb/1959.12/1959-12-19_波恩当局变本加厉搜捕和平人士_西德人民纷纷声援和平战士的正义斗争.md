Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, December 12th: The West German ruling clique, from December 8th to 10th, under the pretext of printing "Communist propaganda," arrested 55 people in seven West German states and West Berlin, and confiscated equipment and vehicles from two printing houses.

According to a spokesman for the Bonn government's Interior Ministry yesterday, this was the largest suppression action since the establishment of West Germany. This action was prepared over several months. It is claimed that West German judicial authorities will prosecute some of those arrested.

The German "904 Free Radio" commented on the mass arrest, pointing out that the Bonn government's suppression action was due to the enormous wage increase struggles it faces domestically and the growing anger of the people against atomic armament. The commentary called for united action to demand the release of those arrested and the lifting of the ban on the German Communist Party.

Compiled report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, the shameful trial in Düsseldorf continues, while the Bonn judicial authorities' false accusation of "treasonous activities" against West German peace defenders has fallen flat. The state prosecutor cannot produce a single witness to confirm the "crimes" of these peace warriors.

To question witnesses, the Düsseldorf court sent people to Munich, Tübingen, and Mainz. On the 14th, the witnesses questioned in Munich included Mesch, former chairman of the Bavarian Peace Committee, Kühlmann, an active participant in the West German women's peace movement, and Paschwitz, a member of the "German Peace Movement" organization. Kühlmann said that there was no question of any anti-constitutional activities. She said that she had previously belonged to the Christian Democratic Union, but when she saw that it advocated rearmament of West Germany, she withdrew from the party. Kühlmann called on the West German government to stop atomic armament.

The court attempted to use Dr. Löwenstein, former chairman of the Bavarian Peace Committee, as a witness to prove that the West German peace movement's actions were "treasonous and communist." However, this attempt failed. Löwenstein stated that the Peace Committee was not a political platform for any party, but a gathering of all peace warriors regardless of their political views.

The prosecutor finally obtained the evidence he needed from the second plaintiff witness, a man named Grüner. However, this witness, who fabricated the so-called "connection" between the Peace Committee and the German Democratic Republic out of thin air, was revealed in court to have real connections with the West German secret police. The presiding judge hastily announced a suspension of the trial.

During the trial on the 17th, the female witness Egnolv said immediately after being summoned to court that since she worked in the state's peace defense committee, the trial was aimed at herself, so she refused to provide any testimony for the trial.

Former police officer and witness Kugler (now retired), who had previously searched the offices of the Peace Defense Committee in the state of Mez, was questioned by the court president, who attempted to guide him to give the answers the plaintiff wanted by reading out the search records, but Kugler repeatedly said that he knew nothing. The judge had to stop questioning this witness.

The judge and prosecutor also attempted to use the female witness Scherer to obtain testimony harmful to the defendants, but she refused.

For more than a month since the trial began, the defendants have received many letters every day, expressing their support and strongly demanding that this shameful trial be stopped. Local peace committees in Hamburg and Kiel, peace movement organizations in Saar, and the anti-West German atomic armament action committee in the Stollmann district have all protested against the trial. Many residents of West Germany have donated money to rescue these heroic peace warriors. A worker named Nitzschmann in Kiel wrote in a letter, "I am not a member of the Peace Committee, nor am I and never have been a member of that party... But I believe that the struggle to protect members of the Peace Committee is a struggle for national civil liberties." (Attached picture)

### 波恩当局变本加厉搜捕和平人士  西德人民纷纷声援和平战士的正义斗争

    波恩当局变本加厉搜捕和平人士
    西德人民纷纷声援和平战士的正义斗争
    据新华社波恩12日电　西德统治集团在8日到10日间以印发“共产党宣传品”为罪品，在西德七个州和西柏林逮捕了五十五人，并且没收了两个印刷所的设备和汽车等。
    据波恩政府内政部发言人昨天承认，这是西德成立以来最大的一次镇压行动。这个行动是经过几个月的准备的。据宣称，西德的司法当局将对其中一部分被捕者提出起诉。
    德国九○四自由广播电台”在评论这次大逮捕时指出，波恩政府这次镇压行动是因为它在国内面临规模巨大的要求增加工资的斗争和人民群众对原子武装的日益增长的愤怒。评论要求展开一致行动，要求释放被逮捕的人和要求取消对德国共产党的禁令。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：杜塞尔多夫的可耻审讯在继续进行，而波恩司法当局对西德保卫和平战士所谓“叛国活动”的诬告已经破产。国家检察官提不出一个证人来证实这些和平战士的“罪过”。
    为了质询证人，杜塞尔多夫法院曾派人到过慕尼黑、土宾根和美因兹。14日在慕尼黑被质询的被告证人有巴伐利亚和平委员会前主席梅施、西德妇女和平运动的积极参加者屈耳曼和“德国和平运动”组织的成员帕施维茨。屈耳曼说，根本就谈不到有什么敌视宪法的活动。她说，早先她曾经属于基督教民主联盟，但是当她看到它主张重新武装西德之后，她就退出了这个党。屈耳曼呼吁西德政府停止原子武装。
    法院企图利用前巴伐利亚和平委员会主席勒文施坦博士作证人，来证实西德和平运动的行动具有“叛国和共产主义的”性质。但是，这种企图破产了。勒文施坦声明说，和平委员会并不是任何政党政治的讲坛，而是集合所有的和平战士不问其政治观点如何。
    检察官从第二个原告证人——一个姓格吕涅尔的人那里总算得到了他所需要的证据。但是，这个无中生有地捏造和平委员会同德意志民主共和国有所谓“联系”的证人，在法庭上却被揭露同西德的秘密警察有着真正的联系。庭长于是匆忙宣布审讯暂停。
    在17日的审讯过程中，女证人埃格诺尔伏被传到法庭后马上就说，由于她在州的保卫和平委员会里工作，审讯就是针对她自己的，所以她拒绝为这次审讯提供任何证词。
    前警察局职员、证人库格勒（现已退休），他过去搜查过美兹因州的保卫和平委员会的委员，而法庭庭长企图通过宣读搜查记录的办法来开导他作出原告所需要的答复，但是库格勒一再说，他什么也不知道。于是法官不得不停止对这个证人的追问。
    法官和检察长还企图利用女证人舍雷尔来获得加害被告的证词，但是也遭到了她的拒绝。
    自从审讯开始后一个多月来，被告们每天都收到很多信件，向他们表示声援并坚决要求停止这一可耻的审判。汉堡和基尔的地方和平委员会会议、萨尔的和平运动组织、反对西德原子武装行动委员会施托尔曼区委员会都对这一审判表示抗议。西德很多居民捐款营救这些英勇的和平战士。基尔一个名叫尼奇曼的工人在信中写道，“我不是和平委员会的成员，我也不是而且从来不是那个党派的成员……但是，我认为保护和平委员会成员的斗争是争取国家公民自由的斗争”。（附图片）
