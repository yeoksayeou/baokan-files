　　This newspaper reports that the iron and steel industry departments of Hunan Province, while striving to better complete this year's production plan, are actively preparing for next year's production to ensure a continued leap forward from the very beginning of next year.

　　In early November, the 100,000-strong iron and steel army of Hunan Province, in accordance with the instructions of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, grasped both overproduction and preparations for next year's production, striking both sets of gongs at the same time. In mid-November, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial industrial production conference, further arranging comprehensive advance completion and overfulfillment of this year's industrial production plan, and concrete measures for preparing for next year's production, especially the first quarter of next year. Since then, various factories have intensified their preparations for next year's production. At present, more than 90% of the iron and steel enterprises in the province have mobilized the masses to discuss the production plan for the first quarter of next year, so that the plan is rooted and takes hold.

　　In order to achieve a "good start" and "complete success" next year, iron and steel enterprises and related departments in Hunan have taken ten specific measures.

　　First, all factories and mines, focusing on the goal of "increasing production without adding manpower or equipment, and reducing manpower," further launched a mass movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, tapping potential from within the enterprise and improving production levels. Many factories and mines in Hengyang Prefecture have realized winch loading, mechanical crushing, self-flowing roasting, and vehicle transportation within the factory, and have also reformed the hot blast stove, greatly improving production efficiency.

　　Second, the entire province is focusing on mining construction and technical transformation of mines to produce more and better ore to meet the needs of pig iron production next year. In early November, the metallurgical department decided to expand and transform twenty-six key mines and forty-one small mining points in batches; immediately organized five mine design teams and eight mine tunneling teams to go to the twenty-six key mines to carry out overall design and tunnel construction work. The forty-one small mining points are also solving problems such as drainage and ventilation in batches.

　　Third, the province is focusing on the storage of raw materials and fuels. All relevant areas in the province are strengthening the leadership of transportation work, focusing on short-distance transportation and transportation scheduling, and actively storing raw materials and fuels under the slogan of storing more than three months' worth of ore and striving to store about one month's worth of coke. Iron factories in Hengyang Prefecture have adopted the method of linking up with neighboring communes to sign contracts, with the people's communes organizing more than 21,000 laborers to contract for production, transportation, and quality, taking on the task of ore storage. As of early December, more than 10,000 tons of ore and more than 4,500 tons of fuel have been stored at the furnace side in the entire region; it is estimated that by the end of December, the entire region will have enough ore for three months and fuel for one to two months for next year.

　　Fourth, on the basis of ensuring the daily production level, equipment is overhauled in a planned and rotating manner, and the production of spare parts is strengthened. At present, the province has overhauled a 600-cubic-meter small blast furnace and properly arranged the overhaul of blast furnaces in the first quarter of next year to ensure that more than 2,300 cubic meters of small blast furnaces are in constant production in the first quarter. Hengyang Prefecture has specially organized a group of technicians to go deep into the iron factories for mobile maintenance, "treating" the machines in the factories. Several key iron factories also have mechanical factories contracted to guarantee maintenance and use, and all equipment that needs to be repaired has been repaired.

　　Fifth, the province is focusing on the construction of transportation both inside and outside the factories and mines. The province has started construction of 223 kilometers of light railways and 28 kilometers of highways in mining areas. After these roads are built, they will enable most mines to achieve a reasonable balance between mining and transportation, basically ensuring that as much is mined underground as can be transported to the furnace side.

　　Sixth, early preparations are being made for frost and rain protection to ensure normal production. All factories and mines in the province have added storage sheds to ensure that small blast furnaces use dry raw materials and fuels; water supply and drainage pipes are wrapped with straw to prevent freezing, and hot air systems are wrapped with asbestos powder or bricks and tiles to strengthen insulation. At the same time, all localities have also paid attention to arranging the winter life of workers.

　　Seventh, the testing system is being improved and the testing level is being raised so that testing work can play a timely role in guiding production. The province recently organized a conference to exchange experiences in testing work. Iron factories in various places have also strengthened the leadership of testing work.

　　Eighth, the province is focusing on various experimental work to prepare for a continued leap forward next year. Several experimental works being carried out in the province include the use of white coal for iron smelting, semi-smokeless briquettes and pulverized coal/coal balls for iron smelting, and six-ton lime rotary furnace external desulfurization. These experiments will pave the way for comprehensive utilization of fuel and expansion of fuel resources next year.

　　Ninth, the province is grasping the capital construction of iron and steel plants to ensure that key projects are put into production on schedule and strive to be put into production ahead of schedule. The rolling mill project of the Lianyuan Iron and Steel Plant and the wire workshop of the Changsha Dongfeng Iron and Steel Plant can be completed within the first few months of next year.

　　Tenth, advanced experiences are being disseminated through observation performances and other forms. All localities are holding irregular professional training classes based on different situations to improve the technical and operational skills of workers. The province has been systematically promoting more than ten successful advanced experiences, such as accelerating the speed of blowers, increasing the air volume, and continuous roasting operations.

　　抓技术革新　抓矿山工作　抓燃料储备　抓设备检修  抓交通运输　抓基本建设　保证明年继续跃进
    本报讯　湖南省钢铁工业部门在争取更好地完成今年生产计划的同时，积极进行明年生产的准备工作，保证明年一开始就出现继续跃进的局面。
    11月上旬，湖南省十万钢铁大军就根据中共湖南省委的指示，一手抓超产，一手抓明年的生产准备，做到两套锣鼓一齐敲。11月中旬中共湖南省委召开全省工业生产会议，进一步安排了全面提前和超额完成今年工业生产计划，和为明年特别是明年第一季度生产作准备的具体措施以后，各厂加紧进行了明年生产的准备工作。现在，全省90％以上的钢铁企业已经发动群众讨论了明年第一季度的生产计划，使计划落脚生根。
    为了实现明年“开门红”和“满堂红”，湖南各地钢铁企业和有关部门采取了十项具体措施。
    首先，各厂矿围绕“增产不加人、不加设备和减少人”的目标，进一步开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，从企业内部挖潜力，提高生产水平。衡阳专区许多厂矿实现了上料用绞车、碎料用机械、焙烧自流化、厂内运输车子化，并且改造了热风炉，大大提高了生产效率。
    其次，全省大抓矿山建设和矿山技术改造，增产更多、更好的矿石，满足明年生铁生产的需要。11月初，冶金部门决定分批扩建和改造二十六个重点矿山、四十一个小矿点；随即组织了五个矿山设计组、八个矿山掘进队分赴二十六个重点矿山，进行总体设计和窿道掘进建设工作。四十一个小矿点也在分批解决排水、通风等问题。
    第三，大抓原料、燃料的储备。全省各有关地区在矿石要储备三个月以上，焦炭力争储备一个月左右的口号下，加强对运输工作的领导，大抓短途运输和运输调度工作，积极储备原料和燃料。衡阳专区各铁厂采取与邻近公社挂钩订合同的办法，由人民公社组织了二万一千多个劳力包产、包运、包质量，担负矿石储备工作。截至12月上旬，全区炉边已存矿石一万多吨，燃料四千五百多吨；预计到12月底，全区即可为明年备足三个月的矿石，一至两个月的燃料。
    第四，在保证日产水平的基础上，有计划地轮流检修设备，并且加强备品备件的生产。现在，全省已经检修好六百立方米的小高炉，并妥善安排了明年第一季度高炉的检修工作，保证第一季度有两千三百多立方米的小高炉经常生产。衡阳专区专门组织了一批技术力量深入铁厂巡回维修，下厂给机器“治病”。几个重点铁厂还由机械厂对口包干，保修、保用，需要检修的设备已全部修好。
    第五，大抓厂矿内外的交通建设。全省已动工修建矿区轻便铁道二百二十三公里，公路二十八公里。这些道路修成后，就可使大部分矿山采矿和运输取得合理平衡，基本上做到井下采多少，就能向炉边运多少。
    第六，提早做好防冻、防雨工作，保证正常生产。全省各厂矿添建了储料棚，保证小高炉使用干的原料和燃料；把供水、排水管用稻草包扎，以防冰冻，热风系统用石棉粉或砖瓦包砌，以加强保温。同时，各地还注意安排了冬季工人的生活。
    第七，健全化验制度，提高化验水平，使化验工作及时起到指导生产的作用。全省最近组织了一次化验工作经验交流会议。各地铁厂也加强了化验工作的领导。
    第八，大抓各项试验工作，为明年继续跃进作长远准备。全省抓的几项试验工作，有白煤炼铁，半烟块煤和末煤、煤球炼铁，六吨石灰回转炉炉外脱硫等。这些试验将为明年综合利用燃料，扩大燃料资源开辟道路。
    第九，抓紧钢铁厂的基本建设工作，保证重点工程按期并争取提前投入生产。涟源钢铁厂的轧机工程、长沙市东风钢铁厂的线材车间，都可以在明年头几个月内完工。
    第十，通过观摩表演等形式传播先进经验。各地都根据不同情况举办不定期的专业训练班，提高工人的技术和操作水平。全省已在有计划地推广加快鼓风机转速、加大风量、焙烧流水作业等十多项成功的先进经验。
