Editor's note: Significant progress has been made in Anhui Province in reforming cooking tools. Here, we introduce two commonly used cooking utensils for reference.

　　　　Rice Washing Machine
    The rice washing machine consists of a rice hopper, a water tank, a rice scrubbing cylinder, and a sand settling tank. The rice hopper is a funnel six hundred millimeters square and four hundred millimeters high, with a water tank two hundred and fifty millimeters high installed on the side. There is a valve at the bottom of the rice hopper and water tank to control the flow of rice and water. Below the valve is a rice scrubbing cylinder, four hundred millimeters long and three hundred millimeters in diameter. A wooden shaft five hundred and fifty millimeters long and two hundred and sixty millimeters in diameter is installed horizontally in the center of the cylinder. The outside of the wooden shaft and the inner wall of the rice scrubbing cylinder are covered with a layer of rubber. By turning the handle of the wooden shaft, the wooden shaft rotates and rubs against the inner wall of the rice scrubbing cylinder to scrub the rice.
    Usage: First, close the pin on the valve, pour rice and water into the rice hopper and water tank respectively, then open the valve, rotate the wooden shaft to rub against the rice scrubbing cylinder, and the rice and water will flow through the sand settling tank into the basket below. The rice washing machine was created by the carpentry workshop of the Bengbu Special District Motor Factory. Operated by one person, this rice washing machine can wash eight hundred catties of rice per hour, increasing work efficiency by more than three times compared to manual rice washing.
　　　　Vegetable Washing Machine
    This tool is suitable for washing vegetables and radishes. The entire machine is divided into two parts: a frame and a vegetable washing cylinder. The frame is a rectangular wooden frame, one thousand two hundred and fifty millimeters long, seven hundred millimeters wide, and six hundred and fifty millimeters high. A wooden drive shaft, eight hundred and fifty millimeters long, is installed horizontally in the center of the frame. A handle is installed on the right end of the shaft, and a vegetable washing cylinder is installed in the middle. The cylinder is five hundred and forty millimeters long and five hundred and fifty millimeters in diameter. The cylinder is nailed with small wooden strips around it, with a spacing of twenty millimeters between the wooden strips. A vegetable loading door is made in the middle, connected by hinges, which can be opened and closed for loading and washing vegetables.
    The vegetable washing machine was created by Taomiao Township in Taihe County. When using it, place the rear legs of the frame in a large wooden basin (or in a pond), fill the basin with clean water, the water should submerge half of the vegetable washing cylinder, then open the vegetable loading door on the vegetable washing cylinder, load the vegetables, close the door, and shake the handle to make the vegetables turn up and down in the vegetable washing cylinder to wash them clean. Operated by one person, it can wash five hundred catties of vegetables per hour.

    巧做饭
    编者按：安徽省各地大抓炊事工具改革，已经取得很大成绩。这里我们介绍两种常用的炊具，供各地参考。
            淘米机
    淘米机由进米斗、进水箱、搓米筒、澄砂槽等部分组成。进米斗是一个六百毫米见方、四百毫米高的漏斗，边上安装一个高二百五十毫米的进水箱。米斗与水箱的下面有一个活门，用以控制米和水的流量。活门的下口，安有一个搓米筒，筒长四百毫米、直径三百毫米，筒的中心横安一根长五百五十毫米，直径二百六十毫米的木轴，木轴的外部和搓米筒的内壁都有一层橡皮，摇动木轴的手把，木轴即旋转和搓米筒内壁磨擦、搓米。
    使用方法：先将活门上插销关起来，把米和水分别倒入进米斗和进水箱，然后打开活门，旋转木轴与搓米筒磨擦搓洗，米和水即经过澄砂槽，流到下面的箩筐里。淘米机是蚌埠专区电机厂木工车间创造的。这淘米机由一人操作，每小时可淘米八百斤，比人工淘米提高工效三倍以上。
              洗菜机
    这种工具适用于洗蔬菜和萝卜。全机分机架和洗菜筒两个部分。机架是一个长方形的木框，长一千二百五十毫米、宽七百毫米、高六百五十毫米。在机架的正中，横安一根木制主动轴，轴长八百五十毫米。轴的右端安一手把，中部装置一个洗菜筒，筒长五百四十毫米，直径五百五十毫米。筒的周围用小木条钉起，木条间距二十毫米，中间做一放菜门，用绞链连接，可以开关，以便装菜和洗菜。
    洗菜机是太和县陶庙乡创制的。使用时，将机架的后腿放在大木盆中（也可以放在塘里），盆内装满清水，水要淹住洗菜筒的一半，然后打开洗菜筒上的放菜门，装入蔬菜，关好门，摇动手把，使蔬菜在洗菜筒中上下翻转洗净。一人操作，每小时可洗菜五百斤。
