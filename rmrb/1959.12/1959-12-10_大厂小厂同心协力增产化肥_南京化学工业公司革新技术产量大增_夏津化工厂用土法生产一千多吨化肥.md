    Large and Small Factories Cooperate to Increase Fertilizer Production
    Nanjing Chemical Industry Company Greatly Increases Production by Reforming Technology  Xiajin Chemical Plant Produces Over 1,000 Tons of Fertilizer Using Indigenous Methods
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 7th: The factories affiliated with the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company are actively increasing the production of chemical fertilizers to support agricultural production. The total output of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers produced from the beginning of this year to the end of November is 28.6% higher than the total output for the entire last year.
    The employees of this company have always regarded supporting agricultural production as the most glorious task. Recently, they have been even more actively engaged in a competition to save raw materials and increase fertilizer production. According to the company's production situation, the key to increasing fertilizer production lies in increasing the output of synthetic ammonia and sulfuric acid. In October, the Yongli Ning Plant and the Phosphate Fertilizer Plant studied measures to rapidly increase the production of sulfuric acid and synthetic ammonia. The company and factories established technical revolution committees, identified sixty-nine major production bottlenecks, and mobilized employees to reform technology. Now, the boiling furnace in the sulfuric acid workshop of the Yongli Ning Plant has created a new record of safe operation for sixty-three consecutive days, resulting in a steady increase in sulfuric acid production. The sulfuric acid production level of the Phosphate Fertilizer Plant has also greatly exceeded its designed capacity. After the synthetic ammonia workshop mobilized employees to tackle key problems, the production level in November increased by 22% compared to September. The increase in the production of sulfuric acid and synthetic ammonia has strongly guaranteed the increase in fertilizer production.
    The employees in the workshops directly producing fertilizers, as well as those in auxiliary workshops, have also worked hard to overcome various difficulties and achieve high yields. The employees of the ammonia processing workshop of the Yongli Ning Plant found ways to use more of the dilute sulfuric acid and "mother liquor" discharged from other workshops as raw materials, and vigorously eliminated leakage, reducing the acid consumption quota per ton of ammonium sulfate by 1%. This not only reduced the cost of ammonium sulfate but also used the saved sulfuric acid to increase the production of chemical fertilizers. To ensure the power supply, the employees in the power workshop technically transformed the No. 9 boiler, increasing the power generation capacity. In order to use some of the unused dilute sulfuric acid and waste acid in production as fertilizer, the repair workers built two sulfuric acid pipelines from the Yongli Ning Plant to the ordinary calcium phosphate workshop of the Phosphate Fertilizer Plant. In this way, more than 100 tons of sulfuric acid can be recovered every day, promoting the increase in superphosphate production.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 7th: This year, the Xiajin County Comprehensive Chemical Plant used indigenous methods to produce more than 140 tons of soda ash and caustic soda, and 1,524 tons of chemical fertilizers such as defluorinated phosphorus, phosphorus bacteria, and superphosphate, as well as more than 5 tons of sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid, supporting the industrial and agricultural production of the county.
    This factory was established last year during the Great Leap Forward in the spirit of moving from simple to complex and from indigenous to modern. After overcoming many technical and raw material difficulties, they successfully rebuilt the large furnace, manufactured a wooden pedal-operated blower to increase the air volume, and changed the original "carbonization tower" drying desulfurization to reverberatory furnace drying desulfurization. As a result, the daily output increased from 90 kilograms to more than 4,300 kilograms; the daily coal consumption decreased from more than 3 tons to about 1 ton; the raw material consumption quota also decreased by more than 40%; and the total cost decreased by more than 50%.

    大厂小厂同心协力增产化肥
    南京化学工业公司革新技术产量大增  夏津化工厂用土法生产一千多吨化肥
    据新华社南京7日电　南京化学工业公司所属各厂积极增产化学肥料，支援农业生产。今年到11月底为止生产的氮、磷、钾三种化学肥料的总产量，比去年全年还多28.6％。
    这个公司的职工一向把支援农业生产当作最光荣的任务，近来更积极地开展了节约原料、增产化肥的竞赛。根据这个公司的生产情况，增产化肥的关键在于提高合成氨和硫酸的产量。公司所属永利宁厂和磷肥厂，在10月份就研究了迅速增产硫酸合成氨的措施。公司和工厂分别成立了技术革命委员会，排出了六十九项重大生产关键，发动职工革新技术。现在永利宁厂硫酸车间的沸腾炉创造了连续六十三天安全运转的新纪录，使硫酸产量稳定上升。磷肥厂的硫酸生产水平也大大超过设计能力。合成氨车间发动职工攻打关键后，11月份的生产水平比9月份提高了22％。硫酸和合成氨产量的提高，有力地保证了化肥的增产。
    直接生产化肥的各车间以及辅助车间的职工，也努力克服各种困难，夺得高产。永利宁厂氨加工车间的职工，设法多用其他车间排出的稀硫酸和“母液”做原料，并且大力消灭滴漏现象，使每吨硫酸铵的用酸定额降低了1％，不但降低了硫酸铵的成本，还用节省下来的硫酸增产了化学肥料。为了保证电力供应，动力车间职工对九号锅炉进行技术改造，提高了发电能力。为了利用生产中用不完的一部分稀硫酸和废酸作肥料，机修工人建筑了两条由永利宁厂通往磷肥厂普钙车间的输酸管道，这样每天就可以回收硫酸一百多吨，促使过磷酸钙增产。
    据新华社济南7日电　夏津县综合化工厂今年用土法生产了纯碱、烧碱一百四十多吨，脱氟磷、磷细菌、过磷酸钙等化学肥料一千五百二十四吨，硫酸、硝酸、盐酸五吨多，支援了本县的工农业生产。
    这个厂是在去年大跃进中本着由简到繁、先土后洋的精神兴办起来的。他们在克服了许多技术上、原料上的困难以后，将大炉改建成功，又制造了一台木制脚踏式鼓风机，加大了风量，并将原来用“炭化塔”烘干脱硫改为反射炉烘干脱硫。结果，日产量由九十公斤跃增到四千三百多公斤；日耗煤量由三吨多降低到一吨左右；原料消耗定额也降低40％以上；总成本因此降低了50％以上。
