Preliminary Experiences in Implementing the Party's Education Policy
Liu Xianzhou, Vice President of Tsinghua University

Over the past year, Tsinghua University has resolutely implemented the Party's General Line and its education policy, achieving comprehensive leaps forward in teaching, scientific research, and production.

The political and ideological awareness of all teachers, students, and staff has been further enhanced, and the Party's leadership and the ideological position of Marxism-Leninism have been further strengthened and consolidated. Through our comprehensive arrangements for teaching, scientific research, and production, we have enabled the three to promote each other, thereby greatly improving the quality of teaching, unifying red and expert, and unifying theory and practice. During their studies, students directly serve socialist construction through productive labor and scientific research work, while receiving comprehensive training as engineers. In scientific research, we have steadfastly implemented the policy of linking theory with practice, orienting ourselves towards production, and paying attention to theoretical scientific research that is significant and has long-term implications, while vigorously launching mass movements. The recent scientific conference featured over 600 scientific papers and reports, four times the number from the old Tsinghua Engineering College over seventeen years. In terms of production, we have focused on scientific research to build on-campus production and scientific research bases, completing tasks with a total output value of over three million yuan, and initially exploring a set of experiences in managing school production and realizing teaching requirements in production.

Over the past year, our achievements have been enormous and our experiences have been rich. Chairman Mao instructed last year that universities should focus on three things: first, Party committee leadership; second, the mass line; and third, the integration of education with productive labor. Chairman Mao's instructions are the three magic weapons for running Tsinghua University well.

Adhere to Putting Politics in Command

Since 1949, our school has experienced three major leaps forward: the teaching reform of 1952, the establishment of a large number of new majors in 1955, and the education revolution of 1958. Each reform and leap forward has been the result of the Party's leadership and the implementation of proletarian politics in command. The vigorous ideological remolding movement in the first half of 1952 laid the political and ideological foundation for the school to carry out departmental adjustments and teaching reforms. From then on, the school broke away from the old capitalist path and embarked on a new socialist path. In 1955, with the smooth implementation of the country's first Five-Year Plan and the vigorous development of the agricultural cooperation movement, our school established a batch of new majors on the basis of successfully carrying out teaching reforms. These majors, which reflected the latest science and technology, had never existed in the history of Tsinghua. In order to meet the needs of the country, and to run these majors well in a short period of time, there were many difficulties. Only because of the Party's political foresight, overcoming right-leaning fear of difficulties, were we able to mobilize the forces to establish them. The education revolution carried out in 1958 was the most profound and thorough socialist revolution in the school. We have achieved comprehensive great leaps forward for two consecutive years. As everyone knows, this is the result of the decisive victory of the political and ideological socialist revolution carried out in 1957, and the result of implementing the Party's education policy. These facts eloquently demonstrate the extreme importance of strengthening the Party's leadership and implementing political command for running schools well.

Putting politics in command means using the Party's General Line and its education policy to guide our thoughts, actions, and work, and constantly breaking down the old traditions of the bourgeoisie. Educational reform, like other reforms, cannot be smooth sailing; in fact, every step forward is accompanied by a struggle between two political paths. Hasn't our experience since 1949 been a process of fighting against bourgeois ideology?

In the past, some people mistakenly advocated: "The Party leads in politics, and experts lead in professional matters." In reality, this meant separating professional matters from proletarian politics, and canceling the Party's leadership over the school. This view has been refuted by the facts of the past ten years, especially the facts of the comprehensive leap forward in the school in the past two years. It is not difficult for people to discover that in any unit where proletarian politics is in command, people's thinking is correct, the direction is right, enthusiasm and unity are strengthened, the relationship between theory and practice is handled correctly, and a leap forward situation appears in the work. Conversely, if bourgeois ideology once gained the upper hand in a unit, it would be lifeless and the work would be slow to progress.

The bourgeois worldview hidden in the fields of teaching and scientific research is one of the most stubborn positions of the bourgeoisie. For example, in teaching, especially in the teaching of basic courses, it is necessary to explain and summarize the history of scientific development, the role of individual scientists, and the regularity of natural phenomena. This involves the issue of worldview; if dialectical materialism is not used to explain and summarize, then idealism and metaphysics must be used, and one of the two must be chosen. If the bourgeois worldview is not criticized, it will inevitably be reflected in the teaching process. The view that political command is not necessary in the professional field is essentially an attempt to transform our school with the bourgeois worldview.

Thoroughly realizing the Party's leadership in the professional field is the fundamental guarantee for building a communist university. This not only requires old teachers to keep up with the situation, strive to transform themselves, and be determined to become intellectuals of the working class, but also requires young teachers to consciously engage in ideological remolding and become both red and expert intellectuals. Although young teachers grew up after liberation, it is not easy for an intellectual to completely eliminate the influence of the bourgeois worldview from the depths of their soul. As long as the struggle between the two roads still exists, the possibility of a few people becoming intellectuals with strong bourgeois ideas still exists if people do not resolve to thoroughly transform their thinking. Some people, after mastering some professional skills, regard them as capital to bargain with the Party and the people. They wear a red coat, are experts in their profession, and feel that they no longer need to listen to the Party. These people are intellectuals who have forgotten their roots, the "Liu Jie-meis" of intellectuals, who no longer want to make revolution, and thus consciously or unconsciously embark on the capitalist road.

Experience has shown that an intellectual, even if he has some skills in his profession, if he does not continue to consciously demand improvement in politics, it is difficult for his profession to progress, and even because he is often driven by the bourgeois ideas of selfishness and self-interest, he is prone to go down the wrong path. Here is a very meaningful example. Everyone knows that Qian Weichang was a mechanic who had won a science prize and once boasted that he was a person "good at cultivating young scientists." He relied on these two signs in politics and on the academic road, and had captured many people. After the anti-Rightist struggle, people have a clearer understanding of his political face. However, there are still a few people who think that "although he is politically不行 (no good), he can still lead academically." The great debate on the two roads of scientific work in our school at the end of 1957 also proved with facts that the direction of bourgeois scientific work represented by him was also wrong and could not be followed. But how should his academic work be evaluated? In order to analyze the influence of his bourgeois ideology on his own scientific research, some mechanics and mathematics teachers and teachers and students of the mechanics research class in our school spent nearly a year to conduct a realistic study of his main works one by one, checked a large number of documents, and checked many data. The results proved that only his early papers and works under the guidance of others were made more carefully. Due to his consistent bourgeois ideas of fame and profit, his work attitude became less serious after becoming a professor in 1946, and plagiarism and shoddy work became more common. The quality of his academic works became worse and worse, and there were often unacceptable errors. The analysis also proved that Qian Weichang's research methods were also very divorced from reality, and there were idealistic tendencies in his academic views. This incident further illustrates to us that red and expert must be combined, and leaving the politics of the proletariat must be the politics of the bourgeoisie, and the road of only expert and not red is not feasible. This principle applies not only to bourgeois intellectuals outside the Party, but also to intellectuals within the Party.

Adhere to the Mass Line

Relying on a few experts to run the school, or implementing the mass line under the leadership of the Party, is another fundamental issue in school work. Many people believe that the mass line is only applicable to political movements, military struggles, and the productive struggles of workers and peasants, while teaching and scientific research can only be the business of experts. They neither recognize that the Party can lead and must lead teaching and scientific research, nor do they recognize the collective wisdom and strength of the masses, and therefore they deny the truth of historical materialism. Therefore, the opposition between the expert line and the mass line is also a reflection of the opposition between two different worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Since 1958, the facts of the education revolution and the leap forward in our school have completely negated the arguments of the opponents of the mass line. In order to carry out various tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to mobilize people's enthusiasm to the fullest extent and give full play to the collective wisdom of the broad masses. Students are not only the objects of education, but also an important force in promoting the progress of all work in the school under the leadership of the Party. In the past two years, the students have participated in various productive labor inside and outside the school with great enthusiasm. They have also carried out scientific research work with a certain level under the guidance of teachers, and have written various useful materials, papers, and teaching materials; in teaching, they participated in the construction of laboratories, thus greatly promoting the improvement of teaching quality and the growth of new majors. Precisely because they are the objects of education, they can also put forward many pertinent opinions on the improvement of teaching. Senior students in some majors have even helped teachers summarize domestic production experience, enrich the content of teaching, and jointly discuss and revise teaching outlines and compile teaching materials with teachers. After introducing production into the education process, the role of staff comrades has also become increasingly important. They not only serve teaching, but also actively participate in some teaching work and production and scientific research work.

The mass line does not in the slightest mean negating or reducing the leading role of teachers. On the contrary, the leading role of teachers is not reduced but even higher. This is because they are not only teachers, but also have to organize and guide scientific research and production work well. That is to say, they not only have to impart knowledge in the classroom, but also are required to gradually become both red and expert intellectuals who can carry out political and ideological education and organize and participate in scientific research and productive labor. This requires them to strive to be in the front, not to fall behind. Of course, when the masses are mobilized, the collective wisdom and creation of the masses will often exceed that of experts. For example, there are more than 50 topics for a program-controlled machine tool to operate stably and improve accuracy; the design plan of the Miyun Reservoir was created by concentrating the advantages of more than 70 comparative plans, which is obviously something that a few teachers cannot do. This requires teachers to be both teachers of the masses and students of the masses. In the past, some people often shouted that the Party did not pay attention to scientific research. In fact, they were "dragons in the style of Lord Ye," but they were using it to attack the Party's leadership and attack teaching reform. Otherwise, why would they shrink back when the masses rose up to engage in scientific research? There are still some people who do not understand that experts can only play the greatest role when combined with the masses, so they are inevitably in danger of falling behind the masses.

In order to implement the mass line, it is necessary to launch a vigorous mass movement. This is the case for doing work, and it is also the case for correcting errors and shortcomings in work. This is because "more people mean more discussions, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive." Once a mass movement appears, evil spirits decline, righteousness rises, and the situation is renewed. It is normal for some partial and temporary shortcomings to occur in a mass movement, which are just problems that do not amount to even one finger in the work. But some people do not see the problem this way. They neither agree with engaging in mass movements in schools, nor do they agree with mobilizing the masses to engage in scientific research. In their view, it seems that mass movements and low quality have an inevitable relationship. But we are historical materialists. If we do not engage in mass movements, we cannot break down the expert line, we cannot break down the superstition of the masses, and the Party's policies cannot be smoothly implemented. As a result, we will still take the cold and lonely old road of the past, and the so-called "quality" will be out of the question. Those who point fingers at the mass movement, saying that it is "walking too fast" or "causing chaos," should compare the facts of today with those of two years ago. Who was right?

Of course, universities need to consider the characteristics of the school in implementing mass movements, and the teaching process needs to have a relatively stable (but not unchanged) teaching order. Therefore, it is necessary to combine regular work with surprise movements, and combine giving play to the initiative of the masses with necessary rules and regulations. But these characteristics must not become a reason to negate mass movements. The question is: should we take a positive attitude towards mass movements or a negative attitude? Should we constantly sum up experience from practice and correctly lead the mass movement? Or should we suppress the mass movement and pour cold water on the masses? There is no doubt that historical materialists are firmly with the masses and are resolute supporters of mass movements. The fact that our school has achieved comprehensive, continuous leaps forward in teaching quality, scientific research, and production in the past two years fully demonstrates that mass movements are orderly and healthy. Contrary to what some people say about "mass movements being chaotic," mass movements must become a routine in work in universities.

After implementing the mass line, the democratic atmosphere in the school has become greatly enriched. This is not only reflected in the mass self-education movement of great blooming, great contending, and great debate in political life, but also makes the democratic atmosphere in academia greatly active. Many of our scientific research and production design plans are summarized after several or even dozens of different plans are compared and debated, and the right to speak in academic matters is no longer "monopolized" by a few people. With the mass line, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" has been better implemented, thus promoting the improvement of the academic level of the masses.

Adhere to the "Three Combinations"

The three combinations of teaching, scientific research, and production are the basic problems in implementing the Party's education policy. If any aspect is relaxed, there will be no three combinations, which is equivalent to canceling the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. Regarding this issue, our approach is:

First, proceeding from the requirements of meeting the students' comprehensive training, make comprehensive arrangements for teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, and strive to closely integrate the three.

Second, proceeding from comprehensively improving the quality of teaching, we not only continue to attach importance to basic technical courses and professional courses, but also take special measures to grasp the two ends. Basic theoretical courses and graduation design are the beginning and end of the student's learning process. At the beginning, a solid foundation must be laid, and at the end, the requirements for comprehensive training must be completed.

Graduation design is the final process of training cadres. Experience over the past year has proved that it is the combination point of the "three combinations" of teaching, scientific research, and production. Last year, 70% of the graduation designs were combined with production. This year, the graduation designs of more than 1,400 graduates are all combined with specific production and scientific research tasks. In the work of collectively participating in graduation design, while individual students delve into key points, they appropriately organize job rotation so that each student can personally practice each of the main parts required by the training objectives, and then collectively discuss, so that each student not only delves into a part, but also learns comprehensively.

Third, establish a new teaching order on a new basis.

After the school launched scientific research and participated in productive labor, it broke the old order and old balance in some aspects, and it is necessary to establish a new order and a new balance on a new basis. If you are afraid of breaking the old order and dare not break through the old framework, you are essentially saying no to revolution. Conversely, if you do not establish a new order in time during the revolution, it will not work either. After our school started production last year, it broke the original order in some aspects. At that time, a few people had a tendency to neglect theoretical study. When the teaching plan was revised last September, some individuals once advocated canceling chemistry, disbanding physics, and replacing professional courses with productive labor. But this opinion was not supported by the majority of people, and the Party committee promptly corrected this kind of one-sided view, insisting on establishing a new order in time on the basis of carrying out productive labor and scientific research, that is, a new order of "three combinations." Teachers and students are required to realize the "three combinations" more consciously and comprehensively. This spring, when tidying up the teaching order, a few people mistakenly understood that it was going back to simply reading again. Some people said: "The production market is falling, and the teaching market is rising." We also corrected this bias, and still did not relax the "three combinations." Neither production nor scientific research relaxed, and a one-year plan was made, and a unified arrangement was made with teaching work, thus ensuring the continued leap forward in this year's work.

In short, we have learned that to implement the Party's education policy, we must establish a new order of "three combinations." This new order should be a unity of continuous revolution and relative stability, and this order must be based on actively carrying out productive labor and scientific research work, and improving the quality of teaching that unifies red and expert and integrates theory with practice, so that teaching, scientific research, and production are closely integrated, rather than passively cutting production, scientific research, or weakening teaching to establish a teaching order. Otherwise, the Party's education policy cannot be fully implemented.

After implementing the three combinations of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, the quality of teaching has rapidly improved, and scientific research and production have greatly developed. The school's three-linked base of teaching, scientific research, and production has also gradually grown, and people have also received good training in their work.

We have learned that the core issue of the Party's education policy is to carry out the transformation of people through the practice of combining education with productive labor, and to rapidly develop our country's socialist science and culture through the transformation of people. Therefore, the Party's education policy is an important part of our country's in-depth and thorough socialist revolution and the General Line.

Judging from the standard of unifying red and expert to measure the quality of cadre training, it should be said that intellectuals participating in productive labor first helps ideological remolding. Once the school's work is combined with the country's socialist construction cause and combined with the productive labor of the working people, it enables intellectuals to leave the "ivory tower" and plunge into the vast world of socialism and the working people. Many teachers and students in the Water Conservancy Department participated in the design work of the Miyun Reservoir, and many of them ate, lived, and worked with the migrant workers. They deeply realized the correctness of the General Line of Socialist Construction and the Great Leap Forward, and the superiority of the People's Commune, and they also initially understood what the urgent demands of the working people are, and thus established deep feelings with the working people. During the flood season, they bravely joined the migrant workers and military workers in rescue work. This sense of responsibility to the country and the people has become a huge driving force for them to be both red and expert. Many people are more passionate about water conservancy, and some people realize the harm that lack of knowledge may cause to production, so they are determined to strictly demand themselves. Many people have significantly improved their academic performance after returning to school.

Many teachers and students also pay attention to the requirements of the General Line of doing more, faster, better, and more economically in productive labor, and consider engineering and technical problems from reality rather than from abstract theory. This proves that once the General Line penetrates people's hearts, people can dare to think and dare to do, and be creative because politics is in command. Before many students do an engineering design, they often first do a "virtual" job and go deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research. The teachers and students of the Architecture Department designed a large opera house, visited workers, peasants, Mei Lanfang, and many actors, musicians, stage workers, and theater staff; in order to make the capacity of the theater toilet design appropriate, the students counted the number of people using the toilet in front of the toilet during the intermission of the current theater performance and observed the degree of crowding. It should be said that this working method was difficult to imagine before, and it was also something that a few bourgeois experts could not do and would not do. From this, it is not difficult to see how close the relationship between red and expert is.

From the expert point of view, productive labor and scientific research have also promoted the improvement of teaching level. The research on clay cement carried out by the Civil Engineering Department last year has later developed into the use of modern electronic instruments to study the microstructure and hardening theory of cement; the research and trial production of program-controlled machine tools carried out by the Mechanical Manufacturing Department has driven the scientific research of several majors in the Automatic Control, Electrical Engineering, and other departments to develop towards cutting-edge technology; a major project in collaboration with the Engineering Physics Department and seven or eight departments including Mechanical, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Automatic Control has driven the scientific research of relevant majors in various departments to develop towards new technologies. These many scientific research results are also reflected in the teaching materials at any time, prompting the teaching materials to be constantly enriched and the content to be constantly innovated and enriched. It can be imagined that on this basis, many original textbooks suitable for our country will be able to be compiled in the future.

In short, our school has implemented the Party's education policy and realized the "three combinations." The work has greatly progressed, not regressed. It is very good, not very bad.

Under the brilliant light of the General Line of Socialist Construction, under the guidance of the Party's education policy, and under the promotion of the national Great Leap Forward situation, our school has achieved great achievements in 1959 on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and some experiences have become more mature and complete. This has laid a good foundation for future work. These achievements fill us with infinite confidence in running our school well. However, we have only implemented the Party's new education policy for two years, and there are still shortcomings in our work. We believe that as long as we adhere to putting politics in command under the leadership of the Party, adhere to the mass line, adhere to the three combinations, in the spirit of combining soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis, set lofty goals, make up our minds, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and work hard, we will definitely be able to achieve greater results in 1960.

　　贯彻党的教育方针的初步经验
　　清华大学副校长　刘仙洲
    一年来，清华大学坚决贯彻执行了党的总路线和党的教育方针，在教学、科学研究和生产方面，获得了全面的跃进。
    全校师生员工的政治思想觉悟进一步提高了，党的领导和马克思列宁主义的思想阵地进一步加强和巩固了。由于我们对教学、科学研究和生产进行了全面的安排，使三者互相促进，因而大大地提高了红专统一、理论与实际统一的教学质量。学生在学习期间，就通过生产劳动和科学研究工作，直接为社会主义建设服务，同时受到了作为一个工程师的全面训练。在科学研究工作中，我们坚定地贯彻执行了联系实际，面向生产，同时又注意重大而有长远意义的理论性科学研究的方针，并且大搞群众运动。在最近举行的科学讨论会上提出的科学论文和报告共六百余篇，这个数目为旧清华工学院十七年的四倍。在生产方面，我们围绕着科学研究，建设校内生产和科学研究基地，完成了三百多万元总产值的任务，初步摸索出了一套管理学校生产和在生产中实现教学要求的经验。
    一年来，我们的成绩是巨大的，经验也是丰富的。毛主席在去年指示说，高等学校要抓住三个东西，一是党委领导，二是群众路线，三是教育与生产劳动相结合。主席的指示是我们办好清华大学的三件法宝。
    坚持政治挂帅
    从1949年到现在，我们学校经历了三次大的跃进。即1952年的教学改革，1955年创办大批新专业和1958年的教育革命。每一次改革和跃进都是党的领导和实行无产阶级政治挂帅的结果。1952年上半年的轰轰烈烈的思想改造运动，为学校进行院系调整和教学改革，在政治上和思想上打下了基础。学校从此摆脱了资本主义的旧道路，走上了社会主义的新道路。1955年随着国家第一个五年计划的顺利执行，在农业合作化运动的蓬勃发展的形势下，我校在胜利地进行了教学改革的基础上，创办了一批新专业。这些反映最新科学技术的专业，在清华历史上是从来没有过的。为了适应国家的需要，又必须在短期内办好这些专业，所以面临的困难是不少的。只是由于党的政治上的远见，克服了右倾畏难的情绪，才能调集力量创办起来。1958年进行的教育革命，是学校中最深刻最彻底的社会主义革命。我们连续两年取得了全面大跃进。大家知道这是在1957年进行的政治上和思想上的社会主义革命取得决定性胜利的结果，是贯彻执行党的教育方针的结果。这些事实雄辩地证明了加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，对办好学校的极端重要性。
    政治挂帅就是要以党的总路线和党的教育方针来指导我们的思想、行动和工作，不断地破除资产阶级的旧传统。教育改革也和其他改革一样，不可能是一帆风顺的，实际上每前进一步都伴随着政治上两条道路的斗争。1949年以来我们的经历，不都是和资产阶级的思想作斗争的过程吗？
    过去有些人错误地主张：“政治上由党领导，业务上由专家领导”。实际上，这就是要业务和无产阶级的政治分家，就是取消党对学校的领导。这种观点已经为十年以来的事实，特别是近两年来学校全面跃进的事实所驳倒。人们不难发现，哪个单位无产阶级政治挂了帅，人们的思想对头，方向正确了，积极性和团结加强了，理论与实践的关系处理对了，工作就出现跃进局面。反之，如果那个单位资产阶级思想一度占了上风，就死气沉沉，工作就迟迟不前。
    在教学与科学研究领域中隐藏的资产阶级的世界观，是资产阶级最顽强的一个阵地。例如在教学中特别是基础课的教学中，需要解释和概括科学发展的历史，个别科学家的作用和自然现象的规律性。这里就牵涉到世界观问题，要不用辩证唯物主义去解释和概括，就必然要用唯心主义和形而上学去解释和概括，二者必居其一。资产阶级世界观如果不得到批判，就必然要反映到教学过程中去。以为业务领域中可以不要政治挂帅的看法实质上就是企图用资产阶级世界观改造我们学校的反映。
    在业务领域中彻底实现党的领导，是我们建设共产主义大学的根本保证。这里不仅要求老教师要跟上形势，努力改造自己，下决心做一个工人阶级的知识分子。而且也要求年青教师自觉地进行思想改造，成为又红又专的知识分子。青年教师虽然是在解放以后成长起来的，但是一个知识分子要在灵魂深处彻底清除资产阶级世界观的影响是不容易的。只要两条道路的斗争还存在，人们如果不下决心彻底改造思想，少数人变成带有浓厚的资产阶级思想的知识分子的可能性就依然存在。有些人在掌握了一些业务本领以后，就把它当作向党和人民讨价还价的资本。他们披着红色外衣，业务上又是内行，觉得就可以不再听党的话了。这种人是知识分子中忘了本的“刘介梅”，他们不想再革命了。因而自觉或不完全自觉地走上了资本主义道路。
    经验证明，一个知识分子，即使在业务上有一些本领，如果不继续在政治上自觉地要求提高，他的业务就很难有进步，甚至因为经常受着资产阶级自私自利的思想所驱使，就容易走到错误的道路上去。这里可以举出一个很有意义的例子。大家都知道，钱伟长是一个得过科学奖金的力学家，并且曾经吹嘘是一个“善于培养青年科学家”的人。他靠这两块牌子在政治上和在学术道路上，曾经俘虏过不少的人。在反右斗争以后，人们对他的政治面貌是认识得比较清楚了。但是也还有少数人认为他“政治上虽然不行了，学术上还可以领导”。我校1957年底的科学工作两条道路大辩论，又用事实证明以他为代表的资产阶级的科学工作方向也是错误的，是走不通的。但是，对他的学术工作应该如何估计呢？为了分析他的资产阶级思想对他自己的科学研究的影响，我校一部分力学和数学教师和力学研究班的教师同学，花了将近一年的时间，实事求是地对他的主要著作逐一进行了研究，查对了大量的文献，校核了许多数据。结果证明，他只有在别人的指导下的早期论文和著作是作得比较认真的。由于他一贯的资产阶级的名利思想，从1946年当了教授以后，工作态度就不认真了，抄袭和粗制滥造就多起来。他的学术著作质量就愈来愈差，并且往往有不可允许的错误。分析的结果还证明，钱伟长的研究方法也是十分脱离实际的，学术观点中存在着唯心主义倾向。这件事向我们进一步说明了，红专必须结合，脱离无产阶级的政治，就一定是资产阶级的政治，只专不红的道路是走不通的。这一原则，不但对于党外的资产阶级知识分子适用，对于党内的知识分子也同样适用。
    坚持群众路线
    办学依靠少数专家，还是在党的领导下，贯彻执行群众路线，这是学校工作中的另一个根本性的问题。有不少人认为群众路线只适用于政治运动、军事斗争和工农群众的生产斗争中，教学、科学研究则只能是专家的事。他们既不承认党能够领导而且也必须领导教学和科学研究，也不承认群众的集体智慧和力量，因而也就否定了历史唯物主义的真理。因此，专家路线和群众路线的对立，同样是无产阶级和资产阶级两种不同的世界观对立的反映。1958年以来，我校教育革命和跃进的事实完全否定了群众路线的反对派的论断。为了多快好省地进行各项工作，就必须最充分地调动人的积极性，发挥广大群众的集体智慧。学生不仅是教育的对象，他们在党的领导下，同时又是推动学校一切工作前进的重要力量。两年来同学们以很大的干劲，参加了校内外各种生产劳动，他们还在教师的指导下，进行了具有一定水平的科学研究工作，写出了各种有用的资料、论文和教材；在教学中他们参加了实验室的建设，因而大大促进了教学质量的提高和新专业的成长。正因为他们是教育的对象，他们对教学的改进也能提出很多中肯的意见。有的专业的高年级同学更帮助教师总结国内的生产经验，充实了教学的内容，和教师共同讨论修改教学大纲，编写教材。将生产引进教育过程以后，职工同志们的作用也日益重要。他们不仅为教学服务，而且可以积极参与一部分教学工作和生产、科学研究工作。
    群众路线，丝毫不意味着抹杀或降低教师的主导作用。恰恰相反，教师的主导作用不是降低了而是更高了。这是因为，他们不仅仅是教师，而且要很好地组织和指导科学研究和生产工作。也就是说，他们不仅要在课堂上传授知识，而且要求逐步地成为又能进行政治思想教育，又能组织和参加科学研究和生产劳动的又红又专的知识分子。这就是要求他们努力走在前面，而不要落在后面。当然，群众发动起来了，群众的集体智慧和创造常常会超过专家。如一台程序控制机床要稳定运行和提高精度，就有五十多个课题；密云水库的设计方案是集中了七十多个比较方案的优点才作成的，这显然不是少数几位教师所能做到的。这就要求教师既当群众的先生，又要当群众的学生。过去有人常常叫喊党不重视科学研究，实际上他们是“叶公好龙”，不过是借以攻击党的领导，攻击教学改革而已。不然，为什么当群众起来大搞科学研究的时候，他们反而缩手缩脚呢？现在也还有些人，不懂得专家只有与群众结合才能发挥最大作用，因而他们就不免有落在群众后面的危险。
    为了贯彻执行群众路线，就要展开轰轰烈烈的群众运动。做工作是如此，纠正工作中的错误缺点也是如此。这是因为“人多议论多，热气高，干劲大”。群众运动一出现，邪气下降，正气抬头，局面就为之一新。在群众运动中，发生一些局部的暂时的缺点，本来是工作中不到一个手指头的问题。但是有的人并不是这样来看待问题，他们既不赞成在学校里搞群众运动，尤其不赞成发动群众搞科学研究。在他们看来，似乎群众运动和质量不高有必然的关系。但是我们是历史唯物主义者，如果不搞群众运动，就不能破除专家路线，不能破除群众的迷信，党的方针也就不能顺利地贯彻执行，结果我们将仍旧走过去的冷冷清清的老路，所谓“质量”也就无从谈起。那些对群众运动指手划脚，说“走的快了”，“搞乱了”的人，应该把今天和两年前的事实对比看看。究竟是谁对了呢？
    当然，高等学校贯彻群众运动需要考虑到学校的特点，教学过程需要有相对稳定的（但不是不变的）教学秩序，因此必须使经常工作与突击运动很好地结合起来，把发挥群众主动性与必要的规章制度结合起来。但是这些特点决不能成为否定群众运动的理由。问题在于：对群众运动采取积极态度还是否定态度，是不断地从实践中总结经验，正确地领导群众运动呢？还是压制群众运动，给群众泼冷水呢？毫无疑问，历史唯物主义者是坚定地同群众在一起，是群众运动的坚决支持者。我们学校两年来教学质量、科学研究和生产获得全面的连续的跃进事实，充分说明了群众运动是有秩序的和健康的。与某些人所说的“群众运动乱哄哄”相反，在高等学校中群众运动必须成为工作中的常规。
    在贯彻执行了群众路线以后，学校的民主空气大大地浓厚了。这不仅表现在政治生活中的大鸣大放大辩论、摆事实讲道理的群众性的自我教育运动中，也同样使学术中的民主空气大大地活跃起来。我们许多科学研究和生产设计方案，都是在几个甚至几十个不同的方案互相比较和辩论以后总结出来的，学术上的发言权不再为少数人所“垄断”。有了群众路线，也就更好地贯彻执行了“百家争鸣”的方针，因而促进了群众性学术水平的提高。
    坚持“三结合”
    教学、科学研究和生产三结合，是贯彻执行党的教育方针的基本问题，如果放松任何一个方面，就没有三结合，就等于取消了党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。关于这个问题，我们的作法是：
    第一，从满足学生的全面培养的要求出发，对教学、科学研究、生产劳动进行全面的安排，力求使教学、科学研究和生产劳动三者密切结合起来。
    第二，从全面提高教学质量出发，我们除依旧重视基础技术课和专业课以外，特别采取了抓紧两头的办法。基础理论课和毕业设计是学生学习过程中的一头一尾，开头必须打好坚实基础，结尾必须完成全面训练的要求。
    毕业设计是培养干部的最后一道工序。一年来的经验证明，它是教学、科学研究和生产“三结合”的结合点。去年的毕业设计有70％是结合生产进行的。今年一千四百多个毕业生的毕业设计全部是结合具体的生产和科学研究任务进行的。学生在集体参加毕业设计工作中，在个人重点深入的同时，适当地组织轮换工作，使培养目标所要求的各主要部分，每个学生都能亲自实践，然后集体讨论，这样就使每个学生既深入了一部分，又学到了全面。
    第三，在新的基础上建立新的教学秩序。
    学校开展科学研究、参加生产劳动以后，在某些方面打破了旧秩序和旧平衡，需要在新的基础上建立新秩序、新平衡。如果害怕打破旧秩序，不敢突破旧框子，实质上就是不要革命。反之，如果在革命中不及时建立新秩序，同样是不行的。我校去年从生产上马以后，在某些方面打破了原来的秩序，当时少数人曾一度出现过忽视理论学习的偏向。在去年9月修订教学计划时，一度有个别人主张取消化学，拆散物理，以生产劳动代替专业课。但这种意见不为多数人所支持，党委及时纠正了这一类片面的观点，坚持在开展生产劳动和科学研究的基础上，及时建立新秩序，也就是“三结合”的新秩序。要求师生更加自觉和全面地实现“三结合”。今年春天，在整顿教学秩序的时候，也有少数人错误地理解为又要回到单纯读书了。有的人说：“生产行市看落，教学行市看涨”。我们也纠正了这种偏向，仍然没有放松“三结合”，生产和科学研究两个方面都没有松劲，作了一年的规划，并且与教学工作进行了统一安排，因而保证了今年工作的继续跃进。
    总之，我们体会到，贯彻党的教育方针，必须建立“三结合”的新秩序。这种新秩序应当是不断革命与相对稳定的统一，这种秩序又必须是建立在以积极开展生产劳动和科学研究工作，和提高红专统一和理论联系实际的教学质量为前提，使教学、科学研究、生产紧密结合起来，而不是消极地砍掉生产、科学研究，或者削弱教学去建立教学秩序。否则就不能完满地贯彻执行党的教育方针。
    实行教学、科学研究和生产劳动三结合以后，教学质量有了迅速提高，科学研究和生产有了很大的发展。学校的教学、科学研究、生产的三联基地也逐渐成长起来，人们在工作中也受到了良好的锻炼。
    我们体会到，党的教育方针的核心问题，是通过教育与生产劳动相结合的实践，进行人的改造，通过人的改造迅速地发展我国的社会主义科学和文化事业。因此，党的教育方针是我国深入彻底地进行社会主义革命和总路线的一个重要组成部分。
    从红专统一的标准来衡量培养干部的质量，应该说，知识分子参加生产劳动首先有助于思想改造。学校的工作一旦同国家的社会主义建设事业结合起来，和劳动人民的生产劳动结合起来，就使知识分子走出了“象牙之塔”，投身到社会主义的、劳动人民的广阔天地。水利系的教师学生在参加密云水库的设计工作中，有许多人同民工同吃同住同劳动，他们比较深刻地体会到社会主义建设总路线、大跃进的正确性和人民公社的优越性，也初步懂得了什么是劳动人民的迫切要求，因而同劳动人民建立了深厚的感情。在汛期，他们奋不顾身地同民工军工一起抢险。这种对国家、对人民的责任感，成了他们又红又专的巨大动力，很多人更加热爱水利事业，有人认识到知识不足对生产可能造成的危害，就下定决心严格要求自己，不少的人回校后学习成绩有了显著提高。
    很多教师、学生在生产劳动中，还注意按照总路线多快好省的要求，从实际出发而不是从抽象的理论出发去考虑工程技术问题。这就证明，总路线一旦深入了人心，人们因政治挂了帅，就能敢想敢干，富于创造性。许多学生在一个工程设计之前，往往首先务虚，深入群众作调查研究。建筑系师生设计的某大歌剧院，访问了工人、农民、梅兰芳和很多演员、乐师、舞台工作者以及剧场的工作人员；为了使剧场厕所设计的容量适当，学生就在现有剧场演出中间休息的时候，在厕所门前统计使用厕所的人数，观察拥挤的程度。应该说，这种工作方法在以前是难于想像的，也是少数资产阶级专家所做不到和不肯做的。从这里不难看出，红和专有着如何密切的关系了。
    从专这方面来看，生产劳动和科学研究也促进了教学水平的提高。土木系从去年进行的粘土水泥的研究，到后来发展到用近代电子仪器研究水泥的微观结构和硬化理论；机械制造系进行的程序控制机床的研究和试制工作，带动了自动控制、电机等系若干个专业的科学研究向尖端技术发展；工程物理系和机械、土木、电机、自动控制等七八个系协作的一个重大项目，带动了各系有关专业的科学研究向着新技术方面发展。这许多科学研究成果，又随时反映到教材里去，促使教材不断地丰富，内容不断地革新和充实。可以设想，在这个基础上，以后将能够编写出很多适合我国需要的、有独创性的教科书。
    总之，我们学校贯彻执行党的教育方针，实现了“三结合”，工作是大大前进了，不是后退了。是好得很，不是糟得很。
    在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的教育方针的思想指导下，在全国大跃进形势的推动下，我们学校在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年又取得了巨大的成绩，有些经验也更成熟、更完备了。这就为今后的工作打下了很好的基础。这些成绩，使我们对办好我们的学校充满了无限信心。但是，我们贯彻执行党的新教育方针，还不过两年，在工作中还有缺点。我们相信只要我们在党的领导下坚持政治挂帅、坚持走群众路线、坚持三结合，本着冲天干劲和科学分析相结合的精神，立大志，下决心，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，努力工作，在1960年，我们一定可以取得更大的成绩。
