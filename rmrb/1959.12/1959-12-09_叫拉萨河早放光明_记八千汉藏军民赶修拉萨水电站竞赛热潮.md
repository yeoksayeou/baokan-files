    Calling on the Lhasa River to Release Light Early
    ——Recording the Competition Surge of Eight Thousand Han and Tibetan Soldiers and Civilians Rushing to Build the Lhasa Hydropower Station
    Zhao Jialie, Zhu Keqiang, Yu Mingzu
    The Lhasa River, which had been silent for hundreds of years, has been singing a tense song of peace for several months.
    This song is sung by the newly liberated Tibetan people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, together with the People's Liberation Army, building a 7,500-kilowatt hydropower station on the ancient Lhasa River.
    This power station is one of the key electricity construction projects of the country's Second Five-Year Plan, located in Najin, under Gaba Mountain, more than ten kilometers east of Lhasa. Construction began on October 1st last year, and it was originally planned to be completed and generate electricity this year. However, the reactionary upper-class group in Tibet attempted to permanently maintain the dark, barbaric, and cruel feudal serf system, obstruct Tibetan construction, and launch an armed rebellion betraying the motherland. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army and Tibetan laborers participating in the construction of the power station had to slow down the construction progress and free up their hands to first eliminate this small group of rebels and overthrow the mountain of the feudal serf system pressing down on the people. Now that both battles have been won, the broad masses of working people in Tibet have plunged into the peaceful battle of building Tibet with unprecedented enthusiasm.
    More than two thousand officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army came to the construction site, driving bulldozers, air compressors, trucks, and hundreds of other pieces of machinery, opening mountains and splitting rocks.
    More than five thousand Tibetan people, together with the People's Liberation Army and Han workers, have invested in this largest construction project in Tibet. They come from all over Tibet, including farmers from the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, herdsmen from the northern Tibetan grasslands, and citizens of Lhasa. They carry willow baskets and push wooden carts to build dams across the river.
    Hundreds of Han technical workers and engineering technicians rushed to the construction site from Beijing, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Anhui, Shaanxi, Hubei, and other places to help the Tibetan people build their own homes. Anshan, Shanghai, Chongqing, Harbin, Lanzhou, and many other cities and factories in the motherland also vigorously supported this construction with their own steel, machinery, and cement.
    All those participating in the construction of the Najin Power Station are engaged in heroic and selfless labor, warmly responding to the battle call issued by the Party Committee of the Power Station Construction Headquarters in early November: resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies and encourage hard work, and speed up the construction of the hydropower station. They split open Gaba Mountain, cut off the Lhasa River, and strive to let the light of the hydropower station shine on the city of Lhasa when the state announces the early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan.
    Entering the severe winter, Lhasa is attacked by sub-zero temperatures of more than ten degrees at night in the river valley, and ice floes float on the Lhasa River. At the power station construction site, no one distinguishes between day and night, warmth and cold. Here, five kilometers up and down the river, the sound of mechanical motors resounds day and night, the entire valley is boiling, and there are rolling crowds of people and leaping red flags everywhere. The sound of blasting cannons and the broadcast of the broadcasting station drive away the tranquility of the river valley, the flying dust covers the snow-covered mountains, and the biting night wind loses its sharpness in front of the bare-chested laborers.
    A heated competition unfolds throughout the power station construction site. Commanding the construction of this power station are two PLA senior colonels, Fu Tingxiu, commander of the power station construction headquarters, and Hong Liu, political commissar. They carry soil and stones, wield drills or swing hammers with the soldiers and civilian workers. Wherever it is difficult and tense, they appear there, from dawn until late at night. These two old comrades, who have known each other for twenty years, have devoted their strength to the liberation and construction of Tibet under the leadership of the Party. They spent the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War together. After advancing into Tibet, they accepted the task of building the Kangzang Highway. One built westward from Ya'an, conquering Que'er Mountain, Jiapila, and the Nu River, directly reaching the Tagong Forest Area; the other built eastward from Lhasa, flattening Minla Mountain and reaching the banks of the Niyang River to meet the eastern line. They and the soldiers they led spent many hard days and nights. Just as they began to build this hydropower station for the Tibetan people, the Tibetan reactionaries rebelled, forcing them to take up arms again to quell the rebellion in Lhasa. Now that the peaceful construction of Tibet has begun, these two old comrades have excitedly brought their troops back to the power station construction site to replace the military map used to fight the reactionaries with an engineering blueprint to fight against nature. The soldiers picked up iron picks again with the hands that held weapons, and they said with ecstasy: "Nine years in Tibet is for today!" Thus, a fierce battle with the Lhasa River was launched again.
    The battle to "speed up the construction of the power station and ask the Lhasa River to send out electricity" began, and the mobile red flag seemed to grow wings, yesterday it was planted on the construction site of this unit, today it was taken away by another unit, today on this locomotive, tomorrow it flies to another. Various work efficiencies are increasing exponentially: Tibetan laborers said, "We are breaking quotas while singing songs." The regulation stipulates that each person should excavate, transport, and fill three cubic meters of soil per day, but they said: "Four cubic meters, five cubic meters are easy to achieve!" There are two types of bulldozers, the daily soil pushing quota is stipulated to be twenty-five and fifty cubic meters, and the soldiers have doubled it, actually reaching seventy, eighty, one hundred, and one hundred and forty; according to requirements, the wind drill operator can grab time by drilling twenty-seven meters a day, but the soldiers complete more than forty meters every day; the drivers simply eat on the road, and the Tibetan and Han installation workers simply do not leave the construction site; mechanical repair workers, medical staff, material supply personnel, cooks, and officers' families are all swept into the surging tide of intense construction.
    The Seventh Company and the Eighth Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, which are responsible for manually drilling blasting holes, launched a fierce "tug-of-war." Since these two companies entered the construction site several months ago, the Eighth Company has been leading the way, and the Seventh Company has been chasing hard behind. In July, the headquarters stipulated that a pair of drill bits (two people) should drill two and a half meters per day, and they reached three meters; in September, the stipulation was three and a half meters, but they completed four meters; after the intensified construction began in November, the quota was raised to four and a half meters, and their achievement was to break through the ten-meter mark.
    The competition unfolded more intensely from November 18th. At the same construction site, with the same stone quality, the Seventh Company worked the night shift, and the Eighth Company worked the day shift. The Seventh Company proposed to surpass its opponent, and the Eighth Company insisted on maintaining its advanced position. On this day, the Eighth Company averaged seven and a half meters, and the Seventh Company only reached six meters, but by the 23rd, the Seventh Company jumped to nine and a half meters, pulling the Eighth Company down by two meters. The Eighth Company held a meeting overnight, and everyone in the team compared their enthusiasm, compared their measures, and seized quotas. After the meeting, people were so excited that they were unwilling to fall asleep, and they came up with ideas, threw down eight-pound hammers, and looked for twelve-pound hammers. On the 25th, they regained the red flag with an average of ten and a half meters per pair of drill bits, the highest reaching thirteen and a half meters. Drilling more than thirteen meters in rock with a hardness of ten requires more than 30,000 hammer blows, hitting forty or fifty blows per minute, which is something that many people dare not think of in the thin air of the plateau, where they are prone to shortness of breath, but they did it.
    Throughout the construction site, Tibetan and Han workers in more than a dozen trades, such as ordinary workers, stonemasons, carpenters, ironworkers, tinsmiths, steelworkers, bricklayers, and installers, are working intensely in this way, chasing each other and racing against time. November 26th was the final battle for the pouring of reinforced concrete for the base plate of the fifth and sixth turbine generator sets in the main powerhouse. At one o'clock in the middle of the night, the steelworkers, who had been fighting continuously for more than thirty hours, quickly tied the last rebar, and the blue electric welding sparks welded the last joint. Pouring began, and more than three hundred Tibetan workers, who were waiting in battle in the mixing shed, quickly operated. They transported sand, stone, and cement in an orderly manner, mixing and pouring, and the push carts for pushing slurry were like shuttles, and a dozen mixing trays were like blossoming flowers. This degree of proficiency makes it hard to imagine that just a month ago, these three hundred people did not even know what concrete was! At that time, when teaching on site and practicing on site, a total of more than six hundred of them watched with surprise as the Han master operators explained, mixing sand, stone, and cement like *tsampa* with water to make something as hard as stone. They practiced happily and learned greedily, saying: To build Tibet, you must learn your skills well. Now, a month has passed, and they have become skilled concrete workers, and they have also undertaken the main task, and this time the task required completion by the afternoon of the next day, but they greeted the dawn with the victory of early completion, and the quality exceeded the standard required by the original design. Hundreds of Tibetan technical workers in various trades throughout the construction site have grown up in this way. As early as the beginning of the construction of the power station, the CPC Tibet Working Committee instructed: In the construction of the power station, a construction team for the Tibetan Plateau must be cultivated. Now, with the progress of the power station project, more than five thousand Tibetan laborers are growing rapidly. They feel that being able to participate in the construction of the hydropower station in their hometown is a great honor, and everyone is actively striving to become an advanced worker in the competition.
    Among the new laborers in the first team of the second labor brigade, there was a young woman named Dazhu. Encouraged by the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, she was sick for three days but refused to tell anyone, insisting on carrying more than five cubic meters of soil every day like everyone else. Finally, she was discovered by the captain, who repeatedly persuaded her to rest. But when the captain went to find the doctor, she started working again. She thought that in the past, she was forced to work even when she was more seriously ill, but now she is working for the people, and if she feels a little uncomfortable, she has to rest. Isn't that shameful? So she went to load soil with the mother who was carrying a basket, and she and the people around her sang a newly composed song while working hard:
    Brothers and sisters!
    For happiness, we must work actively,
    Unite closely under the leadership of the Party,
    Take the bright road of socialism.
    The Najin Power Station construction site is boiling and fighting like this, and more than eight thousand laborers are singing praises to her: Najin, you have spent a miserable time with the Tibetan people, today, in the era when the Tibetan people are the masters of their own affairs, how happy you are! The light and heat you are about to emit will illuminate the Lhasa River Valley even more beautifully. (Attached pictures)

    叫拉萨河早放光明
    ——记八千汉藏军民赶修拉萨水电站竞赛热潮
    赵家烈　朱克强　俞铭祖
    沉静了千百年的拉萨河，几个月来，高唱着一首紧张的和平的赞歌。
    这首赞歌是获得自由新生的西藏人民，在共产党的领导下，同人民解放军一起，在古老的拉萨河上修建一座七千五百瓩的水电站而唱出来的。
    这座电站是国家第二个五年计划电力建设重点工程之一，座落在拉萨东郊十几公里的嘎巴山下的纳金。从去年10月1日开始兴建，原计划在今年建成发电。可是西藏上层反动集团企图永远维护黑暗、野蛮、残酷的封建农奴制度，阻挠西藏建设，而发动了背叛祖国的武装叛乱。于是参加电站施工的人民解放军和藏族民工，不得不放缓建设进度，腾出手来，先消灭这一小撮叛乱分子，推倒压在人民头上的封建农奴制度的大山。现在，这两个战斗都胜利了，西藏广大劳动人民又以从未有过的热情，投入到建设西藏的和平战斗中来。
    二千多人民解放军官兵开到工地来了，他们驾驶着推土机、空气压缩机、大卡车和其他数百件机械，在开山劈石。
    五千多藏族人民，和人民解放军、汉族工人一起投入了这项西藏的最大建设工程。他们来自西藏各地，有雅鲁藏布江畔的农民、藏北草原的牧民和拉萨的市民，他们背着柳条筐、推着木板车在拦河筑坝。
    几百个汉族技术工人和工程技术人员，从北京、四川、江苏、云南、安徽、陕西、湖北等地赶来工地帮助西藏人民建设自己的家乡。鞍山、上海、重庆、哈尔滨、兰州等祖国许多城市、工厂，也用自己生产的钢材、机器和水泥大力支援这项建设。
    所有参加修建纳金电站的人们，都在进行着英勇忘我的劳动，热烈地响应了电站修建指挥部党委在11月上旬发出的战斗号召：坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会的精神，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，加紧修建水电站。他们劈开嘎巴山，截断拉萨河，争取在国家宣布提前完成第二个五年计划的时候，让水电站的光芒照射到拉萨市区。
    进入严冬的拉萨，夜晚，零下十多度的严寒侵袭着河谷，拉萨河上飘着冰凌。在电站工地，谁也不去分别白天和夜晚、温暖和寒冷。这里，沿河上下五公里，白天黑夜，都响彻着机械的马达声，整个山谷在沸腾着，到处是滚滚的人流，跃进的红旗。开山炮声和广播站的广播驱走了河谷的宁静，飞扬的尘土遮盖了白雪的山岭，刺骨的夜风在袒胸露臂的劳动者面前也失去了凌厉。
    整个电站工地，展开热烈的竞赛。指挥这座电站工程施工的是人民解放军的两个大校，电站修建指挥部指挥长扶廷修、政治委员洪流，他们与军工、民工一起背土抬石，掌钎或抡锤，哪里艰苦紧张，就出现在哪里，从拂晓直到深夜。这两个相处二十年的老战友，在党的领导下，曾为解放西藏、建设西藏献出了自己的力量。他们在一起渡过了抗日战争、解放战争的艰苦岁月，进军西藏以后就接受了修筑康藏公路的任务。一个从雅安往西修，征服雀儿山、甲皮拉、怒江，直抵塔工林区；一个从拉萨往东修，踏平敏拉山，到达尼洋河畔与东线会师。他们和自己带领的战士，渡过了许多艰苦的日日夜夜，正当他们开始了为西藏人民建设这座水电站的时候，西藏反动分子叛乱了，迫使他们又拿起武器平息了拉萨的叛乱。现在，西藏的和平建设开始了，这两个老战友兴奋地又把部队拉到电站工地上来，指挥部队与反动派作战的军用地图，换成了与大自然作战的工程蓝图。战士们把持武器的手重新拿起了铁镐，他们欣喜若狂地说：“进藏九年，就是为了今天啊！”于是，一场与拉萨河的激烈战斗又掀起来了。
    “加紧电站建设，要拉萨河送出电力”的战斗开始了，流动红旗像长上了翅膀，昨天插在这个单位的工地上，今天又被另一个单位夺去了，今天在这辆车头，明天又飞到另一辆车上。各种工效在成倍地上涨：藏族民工说“我们是唱着歌儿破指标”，规定每人每天挖、运、填三立方土，他们却说：“四立方、五立方拿得出手哇”；有两种型号的推土机，规定日推土指标为二十五和五十立方，战士们都成倍地超过了，实际达到七十、八十、一百、一百四十；按要求风钻手每天打眼二十七米就可以抢到时间前面，可是战士们每天却完成了四十米以上；驾驶员干脆在公路上吃饭，藏汉族安装工更是不离开工地；机械修理工、医务人员、物资供应人员、炊事人员、以及军官家属都卷入到紧张施工的激流里。
    担负手工打炮眼的人民解放军某团的七中队和八中队，展开了一场激烈的“拉锯战”。这两个中队进入工地几个月来，八中队一路领先，七中队在后猛追。7月，指挥部规定一副炮钎（两人）日打眼二米五，他们达到三米，9月规定三米五，他们却完成了四米，11月加紧施工开始后，指标提高到四米五，而他们取得的战绩是突破十米关。
    竞赛是从11月18日更紧张地展开的。同一个工地，同一样石质，七中队干夜班，八中队干白班，七中队提出要超过对手，八中队坚持要保持先进。这天，八中队平均拿下七米六，七中队只达到六米，可是到23日，七中队跃到九米五，把八中队拉下了两米。八中队连夜开会，全队人人比干劲、比措施、夺指标。会散了，人们都激动得不愿入睡，纷纷酝酿办法，扔下八磅锤，寻找十二磅锤。25日，就以平均每副炮钎达到十米七的战绩，夺回了红旗，最高的达到十三米六。在硬度达到十级的岩石打眼十三米多，需要打三万多锤，每分钟都要打下四、五十锤，这在高原空气稀薄，动辄气喘的情况下，是许多人不敢想的事，可是他们却做出来了。
    整个工地，普通工、石工、木工、铁工、?工、钢筋工、泥水工、安装工等十几个工种的藏、汉族工人，都在这样地你追我赶，分秒必争地紧张劳动着。11月26日，是主厂房五、六台水轮机组底板钢筋混凝土灌浇的最后一战。深夜一时，连续战斗了三十多小时的钢筋工，飞快地绑扎好最后一根钢筋，蓝色的电焊火花，焊接了最后一个节头。浇灌开始了，在拌合棚内严阵以待的三百多藏族工人，飞快地操作起来。他们有条不紊地运来砂、石、水泥，拌合的拌合，浇灌的浇灌，推浆的斗车好似一条穿梭的长龙，十几个拌合盘像朵朵盛开的鲜花。这种熟练的程度，简直使人难以想到，在一个月以前，这三百多人连甚么叫混凝土都不知道呢？当时在现场教学、现场练兵的时候，他们共六百多人惊奇地看着汉族老师傅操作讲解，把砂、石和像?粑一样的水泥用水一拌合，就能做出硬如石头的东西。他们兴高采烈地练习，贪婪地学习，他们说：要建设西藏就要学好本领。现在，一个月过去了，他们都成了熟练的混凝土工人，还担负了主攻任务，并且这次任务要求第二天下午完成，他们却以提前完成的胜利来迎接了黎明，质量还超过原设计要求的标准。整个工地各个工种的数百藏族技术工人，就这样地成长起来。远在电站兴建之初，中共西藏工委就指示：在建设电站中，要培养出一批西藏高原的建筑队伍。现在，随着电站工程的进展，五千多藏族民工正在迅速地成长着。他们感到能够参加建设自己家乡的水电站，是很大的光荣，每一个人都在竞赛中积极地争取成为先进工作者。
    在民工二大队一中队新来的民工里，有一个青年妇女达珠，她受了大伙冲天干劲的鼓舞，病了三天仍不肯告诉别人，坚持和大家一样每天背五方多土，最后被队长发现了，再三劝说她才肯下去休息。可是当队长去找医生时，她又干了起来。她想过去病得比这厉害，贵族老爷还逼着干活，现在为人民劳动，有一点不舒服就要休息，不害羞吗？于是她便去和正背筐的阿妈装土，她和周围的人一面紧张地劳动，一面唱起来新编的歌：
    兄弟姊妹啊！
    为了幸福我们要积极干活，
    紧密团结在党的领导下，
    走社会主义的光明道路。
    纳金电站工地，就这样沸腾着，激战着，八千多劳动大军，为她唱出了赞歌：纳金，你与西藏人民一同度过了悲惨的岁月，今天，在西藏人民当家作主的时代，你是何等的幸福啊！你即将发出的光和热，你将要把拉萨河谷照耀得更加美丽。（附图片）
