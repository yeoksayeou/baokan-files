　　Guided by the General Line, Production Leaps Forward
    The Vivid Experience of the North China Radio Equipment Factory in Comprehensively and Exceedingly Fulfilling This Year's Plan

    (Reported by this newspaper) The North China Radio Equipment United Factory, after a tortuous struggle, won the victory of completing the national plan ahead of schedule this year: total output value and commodity output value completed the annual plan thirty-two days and fifty-one days ahead of schedule respectively. Product output exceeded the plan by 15%, the qualified rate of products exceeded the plan by 13.36%, the cost of comparable products was reduced by 50.96% compared with the plan, profits turned over to the state completed the plan two months ahead of schedule with an excess of 10%, and labor productivity increased by 46.85% compared with the same period last year.
    On the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, this factory, from the beginning of this year, held high the red flag of the General Line and continued to leap forward. The entire factory, from top to bottom, had great enthusiasm, and exceeded the monthly plan from January to May. However, in June and July, due to difficulties such as some raw materials being unqualified, which led to the quality of some products not being high, some cadres' right-leaning conservative thinking grew, and they neither made specific analyses of the difficulties nor mobilized the masses to actively overcome them, believing that the lower the targets, the better. Under the erosion of right-leaning thought, the factory's production was cold and deserted. In June, the factory only completed 95.05% of the national plan, and in July only completed 75.53% of the plan.
    After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the factory's Party committee actively opposed right-leaning tendencies and encouraged vigor, mobilizing the broad masses of workers to set fire to the leading cadres' right-leaning thoughts. Within two or three days, nearly 10,000 big-character posters exposing and criticizing the leading cadres' right-leaning conservative thoughts and fear of difficulties were posted throughout the factory. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the decline in production was mainly due to the failure to implement the Party's General Line, shrinking back when encountering difficulties instead of relying on the masses to solve them. After exposure, criticism, and discussion, the cadres with erroneous thinking began to realize their mistakes, and right-leaning thoughts and slackening were initially reversed.
    After the working direction of the leading cadres was corrected, each production unit then further resolved ideological problems and also solved practical problems through the analysis of many specific issues. "Unqualified materials" was one of the important "reasons" held by those with right-leaning thoughts. The Twenty-Second Workshop once requested the suspension of the production of metal-mold capacitors' insulation resistance because of "unqualified materials." They conducted a specific analysis of this event. After identifying the materials they used—cellulose acetate varnish—only one or two tons out of more than ten tons were rusty and unqualified, and the rest were qualified. The previous request to suspend production was an exaggeration of the difficulties. After this analysis and inspection of the materials, this workshop not only did not request to suspend production, but also proposed increased production targets.
    After a series of struggles, the entire factory was in high spirits, and a vigorous scene appeared in production. In August, more than 500 workers were transferred to support rural vegetable planting, but the total output value increased by 72.5% compared with July, and the quality was also improved. The huge change in production in such a short period of one month made the workers, especially the leading cadres, draw three conclusions: First, in terms of ideology, the General Line must always be the "marshal." Only in this way can we withstand the "cold wind," block evil spirits, have the confidence and methods to overcome difficulties, and be able to do a good job in production. Second, difficulties should be dissected and analyzed specifically, not just shouted vaguely. Third, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses, and any problem can be easily solved.
    The factory's Party committee closely grasped the distinct fact that production in July and August was obviously different, and carried out propaganda in the whole factory in a big way, further opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging vigor. The mass movement of technical innovation and promotion of advanced experience, as well as workers' participation in management, were carried out more effectively. The whole factory set off a comprehensive leap forward in production. According to the development of production, the factory's Party committee constantly put forward new mobilization slogans, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of all the workers, and production continued to leap upward. The total output value increased by 21.61% in September compared with August, 9.21% in October compared with September, and 17.9% in November compared with October, and finally completed the annual plan ahead of schedule.

### 总路线挂帅生产飞跃上升  华北无线电器材厂全面超额完成今年计划的生动经验

　　总路线挂帅生产飞跃上升
    华北无线电器材厂全面超额完成今年计划的生动经验
    本报讯　华北无线电器材联合厂经过一场曲折的斗争，夺得了提前全面超额完成今年国家计划的胜利：总产值和商品产值分别提前三十二天和五十一天完成了全年计划，产品产量超过计划15％，产品的合格率超过计划13.36％，可比产品成本比计划降低50.96％，上缴利润提前两个月超额10％完成了计划，劳动生产率比去年同期增长46.85％。
    这个工厂在去年大跃进的基础上，从年初开始就高举总路线的红旗，继续向前跃进。全厂从上到下干劲很大，1至5月份月月超额完成计划。但是在6、7月间，由于碰到了某些原材料不合格以致有些产品的质量不高等困难，有些干部的右倾保守思想滋长了起来，对困难既不作具体分析，也不发动群众积极克服困难，认为指标“越低越好”。在右倾思想的侵蚀下，工厂的生产冷冷清清，6月份全厂只完成国家计划95.05％，7月份仅完成计划75.53％。
    党的八届八中全会以后，工厂党委积极反右倾、鼓干劲，发动广大职工火烧领导干部的右倾思想，全厂两三天内就贴出了近万张揭发和批判领导干部右倾保守思想和畏难情绪的大字报。经过讨论，大家一致认为：生产下降，主要是因为没有贯彻执行党的总路线，碰到困难往后缩，而不依靠群众去解决。经过揭发、批判和讨论，有错误思想的干部开始认识到自己的错误，右倾思想和畏难松劲情绪初步得到扭转。
    在领导干部的工作方向端正以后，各个生产单位接着就通过对许多具体问题的分析，进一步地解决思想问题，同时也解决实际问题。“材料不合格”，是有右倾思想的人所持的重要“理由”之一。二十二车间曾经因为“材料不合格”要求停产金属模电容器绝缘电阻，他们就对这一事件进行了具体分析。经过对他们使用的材料——醋酸纤维漆进行鉴定，十多吨材料中只有一两吨生了锈，不合格，其他都是合格的。过去要求停产，是把困难过于夸大了。这个车间经过这次对材料的分析检查，不但不要求停产，还提出了增产的指标。
    经过一系列的斗争，全厂群情振奋，生产上出现了蓬蓬勃勃的局面。8月份抽调五百多工人去支援农村种菜，但是总产值比7月份增长了72.5％，质量也有了提高。短短一个多月的时间，生产上发生了如此巨大的变化，使全厂的职工特别是领导干部得出了三条结论：一、思想上必须时时刻刻让总路线成为“元帅”，只有如此才能顶住“冷风”，挡住邪气，有信心有办法克服困难，才能把生产搞得好。二、对困难要进行解剖，具体分析，不能笼统叫喊。三、相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众，什么问题都容易解决。
    这个工厂的党委紧紧抓住7、8两月生产显然不同的鲜明事实，在全厂大张旗鼓地进行了宣传，进一步深入地反右倾鼓干劲，技术革新和推广先进经验的群众运动以及工人参加管理的工作更有效地开展起来，全厂掀起了全面跃进的生产高潮。工厂党委根据生产的发展情况，不断地提出新的动员口号，大大激发了全厂职工的干劲，生产持续不断地飞跃上升。总产值9月又比8月增长21.61％，10月比9月增长9.21％，11月比10月增长17.9％，终于提前全面超额完成了全年计划。
