Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 5th: Hebei Province is widely mobilizing the masses to build roads, construct bridges, and dredge river channels in order to create conditions for completing this year's short-distance transportation plan ahead of schedule and to prepare for next year's transportation tasks.

Since September, the province has repaired more than 5,800 kilometers of highways and newly built or renovated more than 930 kilometers of highways. The harnessing and excavation projects of the Pu River in the Baoding area, the Shijin Canal in the Shijiazhuang area, the Dongfeng Canal in the Handan area, and the Beijing-Tianjin Canal connecting Beijing and Tianjin are also under intense construction in conjunction with water conservancy construction.

Under the unified leadership of the Party committees at the special district, city, and county levels, road construction and river dredging headquarters have been established. They have adopted a combination of long-term road construction and short-term crash programs, using all production gaps to mobilize the masses to build roads, ensuring that road construction and agricultural production are not delayed. Zhangbei County has made unified arrangements for the county's labor force, and by mid-November, it had completed the task of repairing and rebuilding 600 kilometers of highways ahead of schedule. The province has also organized a road maintenance team of more than 10,000 people, responsible for the daily maintenance and repair of roads and bridges.

The vigorous improvement of transportation conditions in various places has powerfully guaranteed the completion of transportation tasks. For many years, lumber in the Chengde area could not be transported out due to inconvenient transportation. Now that forest roads have been built, large quantities of lumber have been continuously transported to various places. After the road from Wu'an to Guoerzhuang Coal Mine was repaired, the coal transported increased by about 20% compared to the past.

    发动群众改善短途运输条件
    河北抓紧修路造桥疏河道
    据新华社天津5日电　河北省各地广泛发动群众修路、造桥、疏浚河道，为提前完成今年短途运输计划，迎接明年运输任务创造条件。
    从9月到现在，这个省已经整修公路五千八百多公里，新建、改建公路九百三十多公里。保定地区的瀑河、石家庄地区的石津运河、邯郸地区的东风渠和沟通京津两市的京津运河的整治和开挖工程，也都在结合水利建设紧张施工。
    各专区、市、县在党委统一领导下，都成立了修路和疏浚河道指挥部，采取长期修路与短期突击相结合的办法，利用一切生产空隙发动群众修筑公路，做到修路和农业生产两不误。张北县统一安排了全县劳力，到11月中旬提前完成了整修和改建公路六百公里的任务。全省并组织了一支有一万多人的养路队，负责日常公路、桥梁的养护和维修工作。
    各地大力改善交通条件，有力地保证了运输任务的完成。承德地区的木材，多年来苦于交通不便不能外运，现在修通了林区道路后，大批木材已能源源运往各地。武安至郭二庄煤矿的道路经过整修，运出的煤炭比过去增加了20％左右。
