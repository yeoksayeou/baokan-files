    Weifang New Spinning Mill
    The newly built Weifang Cotton Mill in Shandong Province has recently been officially put into production. The factory has a total of 50,000 spindles, and all the equipment is domestically produced.

    Weifang City, located in the center of the Changwei area, has a large number of small weaving factories, but lacks spinning mills. In the past, the cotton produced in the area had to be transported to other places for spinning and then transported back for weaving.

    潍坊新添纺纱厂
    山东省新建的潍坊棉纺厂，在最近正式投入生产。这个厂共有五万枚纱锭，设备全是国产的。
    位于昌潍专区中心的潍坊市，拥有大批小型织布厂，但是缺少纺纱厂，专区内盛产的棉花，过去都要运到外地纺纱以后再运回来织布。
