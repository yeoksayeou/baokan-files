Xinhua News Agency, December 1st. The National Coal Mine Basic Construction Advanced Experience Observation and Dissemination Team, jointly organized by the Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union, set off on November 30th to observe and disseminate advanced experience in Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces.

This observation and dissemination team will focus on the weak links and key issues in current coal mine basic construction. It will further promote thirty-one advanced experiences with universal significance in coal mine construction, and continuously enrich and develop new advanced experiences. They will focus on promoting advanced experiences in areas such as four-shift cross-operation, comprehensive work teams, parallel operation of processes, parallel three-dimensional cross-operation, regular multi-cycle operation, and the construction of mines with rough stone masonry, all related to rapid and high-quality construction, safe operation of electromechanical equipment, and versatile civil engineering workers.

The observation and dissemination team is composed of representatives from seven advanced collective units that attended the National "Heroes' Conference." Among these advanced collectives are: the Xu Zhou Wu Xiulun group, which has set eight national well-building records in the past five years; the Lin Mingxiang group from the Fengfeng Xuecun vertical shaft, which completed a pair of mines with an annual output of 900,000 tons in sixteen and a half months; the Shi Degang group from the Huainan Xinzhuangzi Red Flag Youth Shock Brigade, which completed the full-year tunneling task for 1959 in seven and a half months; the Yuan Shuge group from the Hegang Mining Construction Company Rocket Team No. 2, which set a new national record for monthly advance in inclined shafts of 315.2 meters and a new record for monthly advance in semi-coal and rock of 1,004.5 meters; the Hu Qinxiang group from the Nanpiao Development Office, which tried every possible means to adopt a combination of foreign and local methods and achieved a monthly well completion of more than 70 meters; the Jingxi Chang Youkuan group, whose air compressor has been operating safely for five years; and the Han Shunhe group from the Hebi Civil Engineering Office All-Purpose Rebar Worker Youth Shock Brigade.

The observation and dissemination team will adopt a method that combines observation and dissemination of experience with large-scale mass movements, both delivering treasure and learning from others. In addition to disseminating experience in the aforementioned provincial mine construction units, they will also exchange experiences and organize counterpart competitions and tie-in competitions in the form of on-site meetings.

Before the dissemination team set off, Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhong Ziyun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Coal Industry, and Li Chunming, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union, addressed them.

    煤炭工业系统派出先进经验观摩传播队
    全面交流煤矿建设经验
    新华社1日讯　煤炭工业部和中国煤矿工会全国委员会共同组织的全国煤矿基本建设先进经验观摩传播队，在11月30日动身赴陕西、湖南、江西、安徽等省观摩和传播先进经验。
    这次组织的观摩传播队，将主要针对当前煤矿基本建设上的薄弱环节和关键性的问题，进一步推广煤矿建设方面的三十一项具有普遍意义的先进经验，并且不断充实和发展新的先进经验。他们将着重推广四班交叉作业，综合工作队，工序平行作业，平行立体交叉作业，正规多循环，荒料石砌矿等有关快速优质施工、机电安全运转和土建多面手等方面的先进经验。
    观摩传播队是由出席全国“群英会”的七个先进集体单位的代表组成的。这些先进集体中，有五年来先后创八次建井全国新纪录的徐州吴修伦小组；有十六个半月建成一对年产九十万吨矿井的峰峰薛村竖井的吝明祥小组；有七个半月完成1959年全年掘进任务的淮南新庄孜红旗青年突击队中的石德刚小组；有创斜井月进三百一十五点二米全国新纪录和半煤岩月进一千零四点五米新纪录的鹤岗矿建公司火箭二队袁述阁小组；有千方百计采用洋土结合，创造月成井七十多米的南票开发处胡勤祥小组；有压风机五年安全运转的京西常有宽小组；有鹤壁土建处万能钢筋工青年突击队的韩顺和小组。
    观摩传播队将采用观摩传播经验与大搞群众运动相结合的方法，送宝又取经。他们除了在上述各省的矿井建设单位传播经验以外，还将通过现场会议的形式，交流经验，组织对口赛和挂钩赛。
    传播队出发以前，中华全国总工会副主席许之桢，煤炭工业部副部长钟子云，中国煤矿工会全国委员会副主席李春明，分别向他们讲了话。
