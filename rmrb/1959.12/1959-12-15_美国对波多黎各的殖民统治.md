    U.S. Colonial Rule Over Puerto Rico
    Zhang Ye
    In recent years, the struggle of the Puerto Rican people to break free from U.S. colonial rule and achieve independence has been developing. The Puerto Rican Independence Party, the Nationalist Party, the Communist Party, trade unions, youth organizations, and many members of the ruling People's Democratic Party all demand an end to the current colonial system and the attainment of independence. Anti-American demonstrations held by the Puerto Rican people to demand independence have been occurring one after another.
    Puerto Rico is located at the eastern end of the Greater Antilles in the West Indies, including the nearby small islands of Vieques, Culebra, and Mona. It has an area of 8,900 square kilometers and a population of about three million, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world.
    Puerto Rico became a Spanish colony in 1509. At that time, Spanish colonists immigrated to this rich island, using the most brutal methods to enslave, exploit, and massacre the indigenous Indians. By the time the Spanish king ordered the restoration of the Indians' freedom in 1544, the Indians had almost all died out.
    The Puerto Rican people waged an unyielding struggle to overthrow Spanish colonial rule. When the Spanish colonial system tended to collapse in 1825 and most Latin American countries had already gained independence, Puerto Rico was still not liberated. The hero of the independence movement, Bolivar, once led a Colombian army to support the Puerto Rican people's liberation movement, but unfortunately, it failed. It was not until the year before the Spanish-American War (1897) that the Spanish were forced to agree to grant Puerto Rico autonomy.
    When the Spanish-American War began, U.S. President McKinley, in order to win the support of the people of the West Indies, made a guarantee to the struggling Cubans and Puerto Ricans, saying that the United States did not want their land and that the United States would immediately recognize the independence of Cuba and Puerto Rico after the victory of the war. Thus, the U.S. army landed in Guanica in 1898 and subsequently occupied the entire Puerto Rico, and mobilized Puerto Rican manpower and material resources to carry out the Spanish-American War. However, after the victory in the war, McKinley completely betrayed his promise and forcibly incorporated Puerto Rico into the U.S. territory through open aggression, turning it into a U.S. colony.
    From 1898 to 1900, the United States established a military government in Puerto Rico and implemented a cruel colonial rule. In 1900, the U.S. President appointed a governor to rule Puerto Rico. In 1917, the U.S. Congress passed a colonial charter regarding Puerto Rico, stipulating that the U.S. President could appoint and remove the Governor of Puerto Rico at any time, and the political, economic, and educational rights of Puerto Rico were completely controlled by the United States.
    The Puerto Rican people have waged a long and arduous struggle to break free from U.S. colonial rule. In 1947, the United States was forced to allow the election of the Governor of Puerto Rico. However, a few months before the first election of the governor, on June 10, 1948, the Puerto Rican legislature, under pressure from the United States, passed three laws suppressing freedom of speech—Laws Fifty-two, Fifty-three, and Fifty-four—as the "basis" for suppressing and threatening the Puerto Rican people who demanded independence and autonomy. Subsequently, under the direct manipulation of the U.S. government, Luis Muñoz Marín, an agent of the U.S. sugar trust, was "elected" as governor. Marín was re-elected twice in 1952 and 1956.
    Under the resistance of the Puerto Rican people, the United States was forced to allow Puerto Rico to "govern itself" in 1952 and promulgated a constitution. According to the constitution, Puerto Rico is a "free federal state" within the U.S. federal regime. This is nothing more than the result of the U.S. imperialism playing various deceptive tricks in order to create confusion among the people who are fighting for national self-determination and sovereignty. Therefore, the U.S. ruling clique and its mouthpieces have greatly touted the "achievements" of Puerto Rico after its "autonomy." U.S. Vice President Nixon shamelessly called Puerto Rico a "showcase of American cooperation." The agent of U.S. imperialism ruling Puerto Rico, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Marín, also echoed his master, clamoring that Puerto Rico is a "showcase of American democracy," and he also boasted that Puerto Rico's economic development is "perhaps the fastest economic growth rate in all underdeveloped regions in the world." Some U.S. propaganda agencies, such as "The Nation" magazine, even described Puerto Rico as "a place in the Caribbean that exhibits progress" in recent years.
    The tragic thing about U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries is that their lies cannot stand the test of facts. In the more than sixty years of U.S. rule over Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico has not only not been a "showcase of American cooperation," a "showcase of American democracy," nor a "place in the Caribbean that exhibits progress," but on the contrary, it is a colonialist showcase of the United States, a police state full of terror and a veritable U.S. colony.
    Although the United States gave Puerto Rico so-called "autonomy" in the name of a "free federal state" in 1952, U.S. imperialism still fully controls Puerto Rico's internal affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, and economic lifeline. Puerto Rico has no representatives in the U.S. Congress, only a commissioner in Washington. The U.S. Congress, President, and Supreme Court have the power to veto the corresponding institutions in Puerto Rico. In addition to implementing the laws passed by its own parliament, Puerto Rico must also implement U.S. federal laws. The Puerto Rican legislature has no power to pass laws that conflict with U.S. laws. Obviously, the so-called "free federal state" does not touch the foundation of U.S. rule over Puerto Rico at all, and its autonomy in economic, political, and social aspects is extremely limited. As pointed out in a statement written by the Puerto Rican legislature to the U.S. Congress, the regime born in 1952 has not received popular support from the beginning. The masses on the island believe that the current system is a "ridiculous puppet."
    Under the barbaric rule of the U.S. colonial government, Puerto Rico has become a "police state." Police from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, special agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Intelligence Agency, as well as security police, juvenile police, and others engage in repressive activities. The people's democratic freedoms are attacked, and leaders of the independence movement are arrested. At the end of 1954, eleven Puerto Rican Communist leaders were arrested for allegedly violating the Smith Act. At the same time, Puerto Rican Nationalist Party leader Albizu Campos and many other Puerto Rican patriots were also arrested. At that time, Campos was already sixty-two years old, but he was sentenced to sixty years in prison and suffered the torture of the prison system. Fifty people were arrested and imprisoned at the same time as Campos and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is a true reflection of the "showcase of American democracy."
    Economically, Puerto Rico is tightly controlled and cruelly plundered by U.S. monopoly capital. U.S. national institutions and regulations restrict the development of Puerto Rico in all aspects and force the economic structure of Puerto Rico to meet the interests and needs of the United States.
    Puerto Rico has rich reserves of copper, tin, nickel, mercury, silver, platinum, manganese, and gold, but its industry is very poor, mainly some light industries, such as leather products, carpets, straw hats, furniture, buttons, etc. Most of these industries are controlled by U.S. monopoly capital. Due to the Puerto Rican government's preferential treatment of a ten-year tax exemption for industries and the supply of cheap labor in Puerto Rico, U.S. monopoly capital has come here to set up factories. These factories are not large enterprises and employ a total of less than 40,000 workers. However, U.S. imperialists have greatly touted Puerto Rico's "prosperity" and "economic miracle" for this, and even shamelessly called on Cuba to "learn." In fact, Puerto Rico's per capita income is only 470 U.S. dollars, which is less than half of the income of Mississippi, the state with the lowest income in the United States. At the same time, half of the 600,000 workers with labor power are fully unemployed and underemployed.
    In agriculture, U.S. monopoly capital controls 80% of Puerto Rico's land. More than 200,000 Puerto Ricans only have small plots of land of 0.4 to 1.7 hectares. The rest of the people have no land at all, and they have to work as coolies on farms opened by Americans. Since the Americans only develop a single economy in Puerto Rico—sugar cane cultivation—the sugarcane workers in Puerto Rico only have work for five months a year, and the rest of the days are spent in unemployment. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans have to flee to various parts of the United States to find work due to unemployment and poverty. Since 1945, one million Puerto Ricans have gone to the United States to find food. However, the United States is not a "paradise." What Puerto Ricans encounter there is nothing but discrimination, oppression, and exploitation. As the "New Yorker" confessed, their situation is "the same as that of the lowest class of blacks." These facts powerfully expose the U.S. lies about Puerto Rico's "prosperity" and "progress," which are actually nothing more than deceptive propaganda commonly used by U.S. imperialism.
    The United States also strictly controls Puerto Rico's foreign trade. The main industry in Puerto Rico—the sugar industry—is subject to production quotas set by the U.S. government. Aviation and shipping are monopolized by the United States, and Puerto Rico is restricted to using only U.S. ships for foreign trade, which forces Puerto Rico to use the most expensive ships and berths in the world. At the same time, the United States also includes Puerto Rico in the U.S. tariff system, forcing Puerto Rico to trade only with the United States. As a result, Puerto Rico has become one of the largest consumers of U.S. goods per capita, paying 700 million U.S. dollars to the United States every year and creating a trade deficit of 200 million U.S. dollars for Puerto Rico every year. This figure is quite high for Puerto Rico, because its total income is only 179 million U.S. dollars. This huge trade deficit causes Puerto Rico to have a fiscal deficit every year. According to official statistics for the past five years, Puerto Rico's deficit has reached 353 million U.S. dollars, an average of 70 million U.S. dollars per year, and the deficit in 1958 was 118 million U.S. dollars.
    The United States not only implements colonial rule over Puerto Rico in political and economic terms, but also turns Puerto Rico into the easternmost "defense station" of the United States and a base for launching atomic attacks on Central Europe. Currently, 13% of Puerto Rico's land has become a base for U.S. submarines, air forces, atomic bombs, and missiles. Among the twelve bases that have already been built, one missile base is located on the east coast of Puerto Rico near the deep-water port of Aesenada Honda, which is adjacent to the nuclear submarine base. In addition, the Lamer Airport, an air force base on the west coast, may also be equipped with nuclear weapons. In addition, the United States also implements the U.S. compulsory conscription law in Puerto Rico, and those who refuse to serve in the military are sentenced to long-term imprisonment or deportation.
    The Puerto Rican people under U.S. colonial rule do not want this kind of colonialist "cooperation," "democracy," and "progress" from the United States. They have never stopped the struggle against U.S. occupation and for independence. After World War II, the scale of the struggle has further expanded. Under the leadership of the nationalist Nationalists, a nationwide uprising for national independence broke out on October 30, 1950. Although this uprising was suppressed by the U.S. colonial authorities with tanks and artillery, the struggle of the Puerto Rican people did not stop, and anti-American demonstrations and strike movements rose one after another. In February 1952, a 25-day dockworkers' strike paralyzed all ports on the island. In 1954, the Puerto Rican Communist Party held its Fourth Congress, adopted a program, and called for the establishment of a national liberation united front to carry out the struggle for Puerto Rican independence. In January of the same year, a demonstration of 15,000 people demanding independence and opposing U.S. occupation broke out in the capital, San Juan, and from June to July, more than 8,000 dockworkers went on strike for 35 days. In September and October 1958, a large-scale movement demanding national independence was launched. In August and November of this year, two demonstrations against the U.S. occupation broke out one after another, strongly condemning and resisting the so-called "investigation" activities of the U.S. Congress Un-American Activities Committee.
    Faced with the increasingly high tide of the Puerto Rican people's struggle for independence, U.S. imperialism has strengthened repressive measures on the one hand, and played deceptive tricks on the other, plotting to merge Puerto Rico into the United States and become the 51st state of the United States. Puerto Rico's patriotic democratic forces strongly oppose this conspiracy. The movement of the Puerto Rican people for national independence is continuing to develop, and the Puerto Rican Communist Party is sparing no effort to promote the unity of all patriotic and independence-seeking forces and strive to form a strong national liberation front. As long as those who seek independence form an organized and united movement and persevere in the struggle, the Puerto Rican people will surely break free from U.S. colonial rule and turn Puerto Rico into a free, sovereign, and independent republic.

    Xinhua News Agency Draft: On November 20, the Puerto Rican people held a demonstration around the U.S. District Court building in San Juan, strongly protesting the U.S. Congress Un-American Activities Committee's unreasonable summons of Puerto Rican patriots in the name of investigating "Communist activities." The sign in the front reads: "Puerto Rican workers - we protest the U.S. Congress's persecution of our leaders."

    美国对波多黎各的殖民统治
    章叶
    近年以来，波多黎各人民要求摆脱美国殖民统治、争取独立的斗争日益发展。波多黎各独立党、国民党、共产党、工会、青年组织以及执政的人民民主党的许多党员，都要求结束目前的殖民制度，取得独立。波多黎各人民为要求独立而举行的反美示威运动，一波未平一波又起。
    波多黎各位于西印度群岛大安的列斯群岛的东端，包括附近的维埃圭斯、古利布拉、摩那等小岛。面积有八千九百平方公里，人口有三百万左右，是世界上人口密度最密的国家之一。
    波多黎各是在1509年沦为西班牙殖民地的。当时，西班牙殖民者向这个富饶的岛屿移民，用最残暴的方法来奴役、剥削和屠杀土著印第安人。当1544年西班牙国王下令恢复印第安人的自由时，印第安人差不多死亡殆尽了。
    波多黎各人民为推翻西班牙的殖民统治，进行了不屈不挠的斗争。当1825年，西班牙殖民体系趋于崩溃，拉丁美洲大多数国家已经获得独立的时候，波多黎各还未解放，独立运动中的英雄波利瓦曾率领一支哥伦比亚的军队，支援波多黎各人民的解放运动，但是不幸失败了。直到美国—西班牙战争发生的前一年（1897年），西班牙人才被迫答应给波多黎各以自治权。
    当美国—西班牙战争开始的时候，美国总统墨金莱为骗取西印度群岛人民的支持，便向斗争中的古巴人和波多黎各人提出保证，说美国不要他们的土地，战争胜利后美国就立刻承认古巴和波多黎各的独立。于是，美国军队于1898年在瓜尼卡登陆，随后占领了整个波多黎各，并且动员波多黎各的人力和物力来进行美西战争。但是，在战争取得胜利后，墨金莱完全背弃了他的诺言，并用公开侵略的办法，把波多黎各强行并入美国版图，成为美国殖民地。
    从1898年到1900年，美国在波多黎各设立军政府，施行残酷的殖民统治。1900年，美国总统委派总督统治波多黎各。1917年，美国国会通过关于波多黎各的殖民宪章，规定美国总统可以随时任免波多黎各总督，波多黎各的政治、经济、教育等权也完全由美国控制。
    波多黎各人民为摆脱美国的殖民统治，进行了长期而艰苦的斗争。1947年，美国被迫准许由选举产生波多黎各总督。但是，在第一次选举总督前几个月，1948年6月10日，波多黎各议会在美国的压力下通过了三项压制言论自由的法律——第五十二、五十三、五十四条法律，作为镇压和威胁要求独立与自治的波多黎各人民的“根据”。随后，在美国政府直接操纵下，美国糖业托辣斯的代理人路易斯·穆尼奥斯·马林“当选”为总督。1952年及1956年马林又两度连选连任。
    在波多黎各人民的反抗下，美国被迫在1952年允许波多黎各“自治”，并且颁布一部宪法。根据宪法，波多黎各是美国联邦政权以内的“自由联邦”。这不过是美帝国主义多方玩弄欺骗手法的结果，以便在为民族自决权和主权而斗争的人民中间引起混乱。因此，美国统治集团和它的喉舌大肆吹嘘波多黎各“自治”后的“成就”。美国副总统尼克松，曾厚颜无耻地把波多黎各称为“美洲合作的橱窗”。美帝国主义统治波多黎各的代理人、波多黎各总督马林也跟着他主人叫嚷什么波多黎各是一个“美国民主的橱窗”，他还吹嘘说波多黎各的经济发展“也许是世界上所有不发达地区的最快的经济增长速度”。而美国的一些宣传机关，例如“民族”杂志更把波多黎各说成是近年来“加勒比海展览进步的地方”。
    美帝国主义和一切反动派的可悲之处，就在于他们的谎言经不起事实的考验。在美国统治波多黎各的六十多年过程中，波多黎各不但不是“美洲合作的橱窗”，“美国民主的橱窗”，更不是“加勒比海展览进步的地方”，恰恰相反，它是美国一个殖民主义的橱窗，一个充满恐怖的警察国家和名副其实的美国殖民地。
    美国虽然在1952年给波多黎各所谓在“自由联邦”名义下的“自治”，但是，美帝国主义仍全面控制波多黎各的内政、外交、军事和经济命脉。波多黎各没有议员参加美国国会，只有一个驻华盛顿的专员。美国国会、总统和最高法院对波多黎各的相应机构有否决权力。波多黎各除实行本国议会通过的法律外，还须实行美国的联邦法律。波多黎各的立法机关无权通过与美国法律相抵触的法律。显然，所谓“自由联邦”丝毫没有触动美国统治波多黎各的基础，它在经济、政治和社会方面的自主权是极为有限的。正像波多黎各议员写给美国国会的一项声明中所指出的，1952年诞生的政权，从一开始就没有得到人民的支持。岛上群众认为现在的这种制度是“荒唐可笑的木偶”。
    在美国殖民政府的野蛮统治下，波多黎各已经变成一个“警察国家”，美国陆、海、空三军的警察，美国联邦调查局和情报局的特务人员以及保安警察、少年警察等从事镇压活动，人民的民主自由遭到进攻，独立运动的领袖遭到逮捕。1954年底，十一名波多黎各共产党领袖被控违反史密斯法而遭到逮捕。与此同时，波多黎各国民党领袖阿耳维苏·坎波斯和其他许多波多黎各爱国者也遭到逮捕。当时，坎波斯已经是六十二岁高龄了，竟被判处有期徒刑六十年，受着监狱制度的折磨。与坎波斯同时被捕下狱、被判无期徒刑的还有五十人。这就是“美国民主的橱窗”的真实写照。
    在经济上，波多黎各受到美国垄断资本的严密控制和残酷掠夺。美国的国家机构和法规条例，限制波多黎各各方面的发展，并且强使波多黎各的经济结构满足美国的利益和需要。
    波多黎各拥有丰富的铜、锡、镍、水银、银、铂、锰和金矿，但是，它的工业却是非常可怜，主要是一些轻工业，如皮革制品、地毯、草帽、家具、钮扣等。这些工业大都掌握在美国垄断资本的手中。由于波多黎各政府对工业有十年免税的优待，又由于波多黎各有廉价劳动力的供应，美国垄断资本纷纷到这里来开设工厂。这些工厂都不是大企业，雇用的工人总共不到四万人。但是，美帝国主义者却为此而大肆吹嘘波多黎各的“繁荣”和“经济上的奇迹”，甚至恬不知耻地叫古巴“学习”。实际上，波多黎各按人口平均计算的收入只不过是四百七十美元，还不到美国收入最低的州——密士失比州收入一半。同时，在六十万有劳动力的工人中，有一半是全失业和半失业的工人。
    在农业方面，美国垄断资本控制了波多黎各80％的土地。二十万以上的波多黎各人只有零点四到一点七公顷的小块土地。其余的人根本没有土地，他们不得不到美国人开设的农场去做苦工。由于美国人只在波多黎各发展单一经济——蔗糖种植业，波多黎各的甘蔗种植工人每年只有五个月有工可做，其余的日子都在失业中。于是，成千上万的波多黎各人，由于失业和贫困，不得不逃到美国各地去寻找工作。从1945年起，前往美国找饭吃的波多黎各人就有一百万人。然而，美国并不是“乐园”，波多黎各人在那里所遇到的仍然不外是歧视、压迫和剥削。正像“纽约人报”所供认的，他们的处境“和社会最低阶层的黑人的情况一样”。这些事实有力地揭穿了美国关于波多黎各“繁荣”、“进步”的谎言，实际上不过是美帝国主义所惯用的欺骗宣传罢了。
    美国还严格地控制了波多黎各的对外贸易。波多黎各的主要工业——制糖业——由美国政府规定产量限额。航空和海运交通都是美国垄断的，还限制波多黎各只准使用美国船只进行对外贸易，这使波多黎各不得不使用世界上费用最昂贵的船只和停泊地。同时，美国还把波多黎各包括在美国的关税体系之内，迫使波多黎各只能同美国进行贸易。于是，波多黎各成了美国商品按人口平均计算的最大消费者之一，每年要对美国支付七亿美元，并造成波多黎各每年二亿美元的贸易逆差。这个数字对波多黎各说来是相当高的，因为它的总收入只有一亿七千九百万美元。这种巨额贸易逆差使波多黎各年年出现财政赤字。据官方五年来的统计数字证明，波多黎各的赤字达三亿五千三百万美元，每年平均是七千万美元，而1958年的赤字是一亿一千八百万美元。
    美国不仅在政治和经济上对波多黎各实行殖民统治，而且还把波多黎各变成美国极东的“防御站”和对中欧发动原子攻击的基地。目前，波多黎各13％的土地成为美国的潜艇、空军、原子弹和导弹的基地。在已经建成的十二个基地中，有一个导弹基地设在波多黎各东海岸邻近原子潜艇基地深水港埃森纳达·宏达。此外，在西海岸的空军基地拉梅机场也有可能配备着核武器。此外，美国还在波多黎各实施美国的强迫征兵法，拒绝服兵役的要判处长期监禁或驱逐出境。
    在美国殖民统治下的波多黎各人民，并不要美国这种殖民主义的“合作”、“民主”和“进步”。他们从来没有停止过反对美国占领和争取独立的斗争。第二次大战后，斗争的规模更加扩大了。在民族主义的国民党人的领导下，1950年10月30日爆发了全国性的争取民族独立的起义。这次起义虽然被美国殖民当局用坦克和大炮镇压下去了。但是，波多黎各人民的斗争并没有停止，反美示威和罢工运动此伏彼起。1952年2月，历时二十五天的码头工人大罢工，使这个岛国的所有港口陷于瘫痪。1954年波多黎各共产党举行第四次代表大会，通过纲领，号召建立民族解放统一阵线，进行争取波多黎各独立的斗争。同年1月，在首都圣胡安爆发了一万五千人的要求独立、反对美国占领的示威游行，6月到7月又有八千多码头工人进行了三十五天的罢工。1958年9、10月间，掀起一次大规模的要求民族独立的运动。今年8月和11月先后爆发两次反对美国占领的示威游行，并强烈谴责和抵制美国国会非美活动委员会的所谓“调查”活动。
    面对着日益高涨的波多黎各人民争取独立的斗争，美帝国主义一方面加强镇压措施，另方面又玩弄欺骗手法，阴谋把波多黎各合并美国，成为美国的第五十一州。波多黎各的爱国民主力量强烈反对这个阴谋。波多黎各人民争取民族独立的运动正在继续发展，波多黎各共产党不遗余力地促进所有爱国和争取独立力量的团结，争取组成一个强大的民族解放阵线。只要争取独立的人士形成一个有组织和团结的运动，并且坚持斗争，波多黎各人民就一定会摆脱美国的殖民统治，并把波多黎各变成一个自由、主权和独立的共和国。（附图片）
    11月20日，波多黎各人民在圣胡安美国区法院的大厦周围举行了示威，强烈抗议美国国会非美活动委员会以调查“共产主义活动”为名对波多黎各爱国人士进行无理传讯。前面的标语牌上写着：“波多黎各工人们——我们抗议美国国会迫害我们的领袖”。　新华社稿
