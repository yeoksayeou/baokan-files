Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 14th: American Secretary of State Herter once again made remarks on the 13th promoting the "position of strength" policy.

    He made a statement at the Paris airport upon arriving by plane to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, vigorously advocating that the North Atlantic group of countries should step up arms expansion. He tried his best to cast doubt on the Soviet Union's efforts to seek a relaxation of international tensions, saying that it "remains to be proven" whether "the Soviet Union is prepared to hold serious negotiations." He also clamored that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries should make a "realistic assessment" of the international situation, otherwise they would invite "serious errors."

    Herter emphasized that "the defensive strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance and the further strengthening of this strength remain of fundamental importance...We (the United States) have always fully supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This will continue to be our policy."

    Prior to this, American Secretary of the Army Bruck also vigorously advocated arms expansion. On the evening of the 11th, at a gathering of officers at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, he clamored that the United States must not "appease" in international relations, but should continue to strengthen its "strength." He said, "The Army is prepared, but we must be more fully prepared. We must obtain more modern weapons. We must strengthen our existing forces."

    American Chief of Naval Operations Burke spoke at length about "deterrent power" in a speech on the evening of the 8th. He clamored that the United States must have "a navy that is rapid in action, heavy in strike, and equipped with nuclear weapons" as a "deterrent force."

    美国文武官员接连出场
    鼓吹不能放松扩充军备
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱13日又一次发表鼓吹“实力地位”政策的言论。
    他在这一天乘飞机抵达巴黎出席北大西洋公约组织理事会会议时在巴黎机场上发表谈话，大肆鼓吹北大西洋集团各国要加紧扩充军备。他竭力对苏联谋求缓和国际紧张局势的努力散布怀疑，说什么还“有待证明”“苏联是否准备举行认真的谈判”。他并且叫嚷说，北大西洋公约组织国家应对国际形势作出“实事求是的估价”，不然就会招致“严重的错误”。
    赫脱强调说，“北大西洋公约组织联盟的防御力量和进一步加强这种力量仍然具有根本的重要意义……我们（美国）始终全力支持北大西洋公约组织。这将继续是我们的政策。”
    在这以前，美国陆军部长布鲁克也大力鼓吹扩充军备。他11日晚上在美国密苏里州利昂拿得伍德堡一个军官集会上叫嚷美国在国际关系上决不能“姑息”，而要继续加强“实力”。他说，“陆军是准备着，但是我们要更充分的准备。我们要获得更多的现代化武器。我们要加强我们现有的力量。”
    美国海军作战参谋长伯克8日晚上在一篇演说中大谈“威慑力量”，他叫嚷美国要有“一支行动迅速、打击沉重、有核装备的海军”，以作为一支“威慑力量”。
