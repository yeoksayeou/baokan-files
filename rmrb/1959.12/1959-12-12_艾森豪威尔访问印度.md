Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 11th—U.S. President Eisenhower is currently visiting India. He arrived in New Delhi by plane from Kabul on the afternoon of December 9 and will be visiting India for five days. On the morning of the 10th, Eisenhower visited Indian President Prasad and began talks with Prime Minister Nehru. On the afternoon of the 10th, Eisenhower delivered a speech at a joint session of the People's House and the Federal House of the Indian Parliament.

In his speech, Eisenhower used many phrases to promote the United States' "desire for peace." He said that the United States "does not want an inch of anyone else's land, it does not want to control the governments of other countries' people, and it does not pursue any expansion plan that harms others in terms of commerce, politics, or power." He stated that "supervised disarmament is urgently needed in our time." However, in the same speech, Eisenhower vigorously promoted the aggressive and war policies that the U.S. government has implemented over the past decade. He described the war of aggression launched by the United States in Korea as being for the purpose of enabling "the United Nations and the rule of law to be maintained in the Republic of Korea." He used the Cold War language commonly used by the U.S. ruling clique, declaring that the root cause of a series of "severe and shocking events" that have occurred over the past decade is "the aggressive intent of a foreign philosophy supported by enormous military power." He said, "Because of this fact, we Americans believe it is necessary to show that we ourselves are determined to resist" what he called "aggression" by providing sufficient armed forces. He also said that he would provide such armed forces to "serve our friends and allies."

    艾森豪威尔访问印度
    新华社11日讯　新德里消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔目前正在印度访问。他是12月9日下午从喀布尔乘飞机到达新德里的，他将在印度访问五天。10日上午艾森豪威尔拜访了印度总统普拉沙德，并且开始同尼赫鲁总理会谈。10日下午，艾森豪威尔在印度议会人民院和联邦院的联席会议上发表了演说。
    艾森豪威尔在他的演说中用了很多词句来宣传美国的“和平愿望”。他说，美国“不要别人一寸土地，它不想控制其它国家的人民的政府，它不奉行任何一种商业、政治或力量方面损人的扩张计划”。他表示“有监督的裁军是我们时代所迫切需要的”。但是，艾森豪威尔又在同一篇演说中大事鼓吹美国政府过去十年来所执行的侵略政策和战争政策。他把美国在朝鲜发动的侵略战争说成是为了使“联合国和法治能够在大韩民国保持下去”。他使用了美国统治集团中惯用的冷战语言，宣称过去十年来发生一系列的“严酷的惊人事件”的根源是“得到巨大军事力量支持的一种异国哲学的侵略意图”。他说，“由于这种事实，我们美国人认为有必要表明，我们自己决心通过提供足够的武装部队来抵抗”他所谓的“侵略”。他并说将提供这种武装部队为“我们的朋友和盟国服务”。
