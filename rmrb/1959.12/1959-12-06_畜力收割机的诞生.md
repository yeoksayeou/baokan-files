　　The Birth of the Animal-Powered Harvester
　　Zhou Zhesheng

　　One morning in late October, Zhou Zhizhen, a member of the Huozhuang Production Team of the Zhanggang Commune in Jiangdu County, excitedly rushed home to tell her eighty-three-year-old mother, Sun, about the county committee's announcement that an animal-powered harvester demonstration would be held in Huozhuang that afternoon. Old lady Sun shook her head upon hearing this, saying, "From ancient times until now, rice has always been harvested with sickles. A machine doesn't have hands, how can it harvest?"

　　At three o'clock in the afternoon, the animal-powered harvester demonstration began, and the commune members crowded around the field like they were watching a temple fair. Old lady Sun was attracted by the noise outside and asked her granddaughter to help her to the edge of the field. People made way for her to get to the front. The old woman, with her eyes wide open, watched the machine quickly harvest the rice, bundles of rice falling down neatly, even neater than hand-harvested. "It's amazing! The ox drags the machine, and the rice falls down in bundles, even neater than people can cut it," Old lady Sun said to the people beside her. "If we had such a clever treasure earlier, I would have suffered dozens of years less. You are so lucky!"

　　This animal-powered harvester was trial-produced by the Jiangdu County Agricultural Tool Reform Experimental Factory.

　　The Jiangdu County Agricultural Tool Reform Experimental Factory only has eleven workers, all skilled blacksmiths and carpenters from the countryside. When the factory was first established last July, they only had two red furnaces and some simple tools. But skilled hands can do skillful work. Without new tools, they used old ones and made earthen ones to equip themselves. Drilling holes in iron parts required a drill press, but they didn't have one. So, they found a square-threaded screw in a pile of scrap iron, pieced it together, and assembled a hand-cranked drill. In this way, over the past year, they have created, imitated, and modified more than sixty kinds of new agricultural tools, two hundred pieces in total. Among them, the animal-powered harvester and the post-less winch are new types of agricultural tools that are highly efficient, inexpensive, simple, and practical. This year, more than ten of these new agricultural tools have been finalized and promoted nationwide or province-wide.

　　For a factory with such simple equipment and poor technical conditions to produce so many new agricultural tools, they encountered many difficulties. Just during the trial production of the animal-powered harvester, someone calculated that they had overcome a total of one hundred and six difficulties.

　　The trial production of the animal-powered harvester was led by veteran ironworker Yu Mingshun.

　　Yu Mingshun is a well-known tough guy in the factory, never backing down when faced with difficulties. This time, in manufacturing the animal-powered harvester, he overcame countless difficulties again. The last difficulty was how to make the rectangular back of the cutter guard expose the blade. This was a tricky task. Some people said, "This foreign stuff is not something a mechanical agricultural tool factory can do. We don't have casting equipment or lathes. Just relying on manual work, we'll wear out our hands and still not be able to do it!" Yu Mingshun himself was also very anxious. Like everyone else, he had never seen this thing before. But he didn't lose heart. He said to everyone, "We are all from farming backgrounds. In the past, whenever it was harvest time, we had a taste that was both sweet and bitter. Sweet because we had a harvest, bitter because we had to bend over to harvest all day long, with aching backs and sore legs, suffering for a month or two to finish the harvest. Now, if we put in more effort and can make a harvester, once the thousand-year sickle is discarded, farmers won't have to bend over to harvest. How great would that be! We have overcome one hundred and five difficulties, can't we really overcome this last one? We must make the harvester."

　　After he said this, everyone's enthusiasm rose again, and they carried out many more experiments. The one hundred and sixth difficulty was finally overcome, and the animal-powered harvester was born. This harvester is entirely made of iron and wood, with a simple structure. It only requires one ox to pull and two people to operate. It can harvest twenty-five to thirty mu of rice per day, greatly improving efficiency. At the recent Jiangsu Province Agricultural Tool Reform On-site Conference, it was praised by the masses and has become one of the advanced agricultural tools promoted nationwide.

    畜力收割机的诞生
    周哲生
    10月下旬的一个上午，江都县张纲公社霍庄生产队社员周志珍，兴致勃勃地赶回家里，把县委当天下午要在霍庄举行畜力收割机表演的消息，告诉了她的八十三岁母亲孙老太。孙老太听到摇了摇头说：“从古到今都是用镰刀割稻，机器又没有手，怎么割法？”
    下午三点钟，畜力收割机开始表演了，社员们像看庙会似地老早就在这块田的四周密密地围了起来。孙老太也被门外的热闹声吸引了，要孙女儿把她搀扶到田头。人们闪出路让孙老太到最前面去。老人家睁大着眼睛，一眨也不眨地看着机器飞快地收割稻子，咧着张瘪嘴直是笑。“真稀奇！老牛把机子拖过去，稻子就成把的倒下来，比人割的还整齐。”孙老太向身旁的人说：“这么灵巧的宝贝早有的话，我也少吃几十年的苦，你们真有福气啊！”
    这部畜力收割机，是江都县农具改革试验工厂试制的。
    江都县农具改革试验工厂只有十一个工人，都是来自农村的巧铁匠巧木匠。去年7月刚办厂的时候，他们只有两盘红炉和一些简单的工具，可是巧人手下出巧活，没有新工具，就利用旧的，制造土的，自己武装自己。铁器制件打眼需要钻床，没有，大家在废铁堆里找出个方牙罗丝，拼拼凑凑，装成一部摇眼扳钻。就这样，一年多来他们创造、仿制、改制了新农具六十多种，二百件，其中畜力收割机、无桩绞关都是工效高，花钱少，既简单，又实用的新式农具。这些新农具，今年已经有十多种在全国或全省定型推广。
    这样一个设备简陋技术条件差的工厂，要造这许多新农具，遇到的困难是不少的。光是试制畜力收割机时，就有人算过账，他们前后一共过了一百零六道难关。
    领导畜力收割机试制工作的是老铁工俞明顺。
    俞明顺是厂里有名的硬汉，碰到困难从来不回头。这次制造畜力收割机，又闯过了无数次难关。最后一关怎样才能使长方形背部的护刀器露出刀口来。这是一个棘手的活。有的人说：“这种洋货到底不是机械农具厂干的，我们没翻砂设备，也没有车床，单凭手工，磨烂了双手也搞不出来！”俞明顺自己也很着急，他也和大家一样，从出娘胎就没有看过这玩意。不过他没有灰心，他对大家说：“我们都是种田的出身，过去每逢庄稼收割时，心里有股又甜又苦的滋味，甜的是有了收成，苦的是成天弓着腰收割，腰酸腿痛，挨上个把月苦才把粮食收割清。现在我们多出力，能把收割机搞出来，千年镰刀一旦抛，农民收割不弯腰，这该多好啊！我们遇到的一百零五道难关都突破了，难道这最后一道关真过不去吗？我们一定要把收割机制成。”
    经他这么一说，大伙的劲头又上来了，又进行了许多试验，第一百零六道难关终于又闯过了，畜力收割机也就诞生了。这种收割机全部是铁木结构，构造简单，只需一条牛拉，两个人操作，每天割稻二十五亩到三十亩，工效大大提高。最近江苏省召开的农具改革现场会上，它受到了群众赞赏，成为全国推广的先进农具之一。
