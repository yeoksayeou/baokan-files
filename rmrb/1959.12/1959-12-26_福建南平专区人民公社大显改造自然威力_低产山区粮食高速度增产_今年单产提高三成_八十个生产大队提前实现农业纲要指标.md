Fuzhou, December 25th (reported by this newspaper) – Nanping Special Zone in Fujian is a well-known low-yielding mountainous area for grain production. However, under the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels, the people's communes are demonstrating the great power of transforming nature, rapidly changing the low-yield state of the mountainous areas, and achieving a bumper harvest in grain production this year. The total grain output of the entire special zone this year increased by 22% compared to the great leap forward of last year, and the average unit yield increased by more than 30%. In the mountainous areas of the Min River's upper and middle reaches, Wuyi Mountain, and Xianxia Ridge, large tracts of low-yielding mountain terraces have been transformed into high-yielding fields. In the entire special zone, there are more than 1.8 million mu of rice fields with a yield of over 600 jin per mu, accounting for more than 43.6% of the total rice area. There are more than 200,000 mu with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. Eighty brigades have reached an average yield of over 800 jin per mu, achieving the national agricultural development program's production targets eight years ahead of schedule. Twelve brigades have an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, becoming "thousand-jin brigades."

The Nanping Special Zone has many mountains, much land, and a shortage of labor. Historically, cultivation has been relatively extensive, and water conservancy facilities are poor. Mountain fields are often subjected to uncontrolled irrigation by cold mountain springs, causing nutrient loss and low ground temperatures, resulting in large areas of infertile land. Of the special zone's more than 5.27 million mu of cultivated land, sandy gravel fields, clay fields, muddy fields, and fields subject to uncontrolled and cold-water irrigation account for approximately 80%. The grain yield of these mountain fields is relatively low, previously generally only one to two hundred jin per mu.

Under the leadership of the Party, the people here have been continuously transforming low-yielding fields for several years, and grain production has steadily increased. However, planned and large-scale transformation of low-yielding fields began during the Great Leap Forward last year and after the realization of communization. Party committees at all levels in the special zone took effective measures to lead the masses in carrying out the "three reforms" movement, namely, changing uncontrolled irrigation to rotational irrigation, transforming muddy fields, and transforming cold-water fields. This year alone, more than 3 million mu (two-thirds of the special zone's cultivated land area) of land has undergone soil improvement, and irrigation conditions have been improved, resulting in a very significant increase in production. After the complete transformation of more than 43,000 mu of low-yielding fields in the Wutai Commune in the suburbs of Nanping City (formerly Nanping County), a bumper harvest of single-season late rice was achieved, with an average yield of 551 jin per mu, an increase of 69% compared to last year. Among them, more than 10,000 mu yielded over 700 jin per mu, and 1,086 mu of high-yielding fields with a yield of 1,000 jin appeared.

In order to ensure that the movement to transform low-yielding mountain fields is carried out in a planned and comprehensive manner, Party committees at all levels led all departments and communes in carrying out a soil survey movement throughout the special zone. In this movement, more than 6,000 farmer soil experts in the entire special zone played an active role. They have explored a complete set of rich experiences on the distribution of various types of soil, the laws of change, classification systems, and improvement measures.

In the movement to transform low-yielding fields, all localities, under the unified leadership of the communes, organized forces at the brigade and production team levels to carry out mass movements on a large scale, ensuring that the movement to transform low-yielding fields was carried out quickly and well. Last winter and this spring, seventeen people's communes in the entire special zone implemented the principle of equivalent exchange, uniformly allocated labor, and organized more than 7,000 professional teams to transform low-yielding fields, with more than 200,000 people going to the mountains to carry out soil improvement. Guangze, Shaowu, Jianyang and other counties also organized more than 1,000 expedition teams, making the mountains their home, to carry out the work of transforming low-yielding fields.

　　福建南平专区人民公社大显改造自然威力
    低产山区粮食高速度增产
    今年单产提高三成  八十个生产大队提前实现农业纲要指标
    本报福州25日电　福建南平专区是个著名的粮食低产山区，但是在各级党委的强有力的领导下，各人民公社大显改造自然的威力，迅速改变了山区低产面貌，获得今年粮食生产的大丰收。全区今年粮食总产量在去年大跃进的基础上，增加二成二，单位产量平均增加三成多。在闽江中上游，武夷山和仙霞岭的山区里，大量的低产山垅梯田，变成了高产田。全区各公社粮食亩产稻谷六百斤以上的有一百八十多万亩，占稻谷总面积的43.6％以上，亩产千斤以上的有二十多万亩。有八十个大队达到平均亩产八百斤以上，提前八年实现了全国农业发展纲要的产量指标：有十二个大队平均亩产千斤以上，成为千斤队。
    南平专区山多、地多、劳力少，历来耕作比较粗放，水利设施也较差，山田常年受山泉冷水串灌漫流，肥份流失，地温低，形成大片土地贫瘠，全区五百二十七万多亩耕地中，砂砾田、粘土田、烂泥田和串灌田、冷水田约占80％左右。这些山田的粮食产量都比较低，以往一般亩产只有一、两百斤。
    这里的人民在党的领导下，几年来不断进行改造低产田的工作，粮食产量不断有所提高。但是，有计划、大规模的改造低产田的工作，还是在去年大跃进中和实现公社化以后。专区各级党委采取有力措施，领导群众开展“三改”运动，即改串灌漫流为轮灌，改造烂泥田和改造冷水田。今年一年，就把三百多万亩（占全区耕地面积的三分之二）土地进行了土壤改良，改善了灌溉条件，增产非常显著。南平市郊区（原南平县）五台公社四万三千多亩低产田全部改造以后，单季晚稻获得大丰收，平均亩产五百五十一斤，比去年增产六成九。其中亩产七百斤以上的达一万多亩，并出现了一千零八十六亩千斤高额丰产田。
    为了使改造低产山田运动有计划地全面展开，各级党委领导各部门和各公社在全区范围内开展了土壤普查运动。在这一运动中，全专区六千多个农民土壤专家发挥了积极作用，他们对各类土壤的分布、改变的规律、分类系统、改良措施等等，已摸索到一整套的丰富经验。
    各地在改造低产田运动中，都在公社的统一领导下，以大队、生产队为单位组织力量，大搞群众运动，使改造低产田运动进行得又快又好。去冬今春，全区十七个人民公社，贯彻等价交换的原则，统一调配劳力，组织了七千多个改造低产田的专业队，有二十多万人上山突击改良土壤。光泽、邵武、建阳等县还组织了一千多个远征队，以山为家，进行改造低产田工作。
