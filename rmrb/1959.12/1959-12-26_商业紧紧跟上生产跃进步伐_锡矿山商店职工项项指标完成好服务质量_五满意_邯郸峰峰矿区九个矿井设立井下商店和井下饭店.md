Commerce Closely Follows the Pace of Production Leaps Forward

　　Xikuangshan Store Employees Complete All Targets Well, Service Quality Achieves "Five Satisfactions"
　　Fengfeng Mining District in Handan Sets Up Underground Stores and Underground Restaurants in Nine Mines

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Hunan Province's Xikuangshan Trading Store, in the movement to learn from the Tongjialiang Store in Kouquan District, Datong City, Shanxi Province, firmly implements the policy of serving industrial and mining production and the lives of employees, striving to expand sources of goods, improve supply methods, and enhance service attitude, powerfully supporting Xikuangshan in completing its 1959 production plan thirty-five days ahead of schedule. The store itself has also overfulfilled its commercial leap forward plan, becoming a bright red banner among commercial units in industrial and mining areas throughout the province, with excellent completion of all targets and "five satisfactions" in service quality.

　　The Xikuangshan Trading Store is responsible for the material supply of tens of thousands of people in nine factories and mines, including Xikuangshan, Lengshuijiang Iron and Steel Plant, and Jinzhushan Coal Mine. Thanks to the full effort of all store employees, overcoming all difficulties, they have achieved tremendous results in material supply.

　　In the past, the supply of vegetables and meat in the mining area relied on external sources. Since the beginning of this year, the store has vigorously developed production bases. Currently, the mining area has raised 3,700 pigs and 35,000 poultry. To develop vegetable production in the mining area, the store has also assigned one full-time cadre and two part-time cadres specifically responsible for vegetable work. The vegetable planting area in the entire mining area has been expanded to more than 2,700 mu, so the entire mining area is basically self-sufficient in vegetables. In addition, in the work of processing non-staple foods, they have vigorously carried out technical innovations to improve labor efficiency, increasing the daily output of pastries and candies from the original 700 jin to 10,000 jin. In increasing the variety of non-staple food supplies, they have made full use of substitutes, producing more than 80,000 jin of various non-staple foods such as pastries, candies, and alcoholic beverages in just three months, expanding the supply and meeting the needs of the miners, which the workers are very satisfied with. For example, electrical and mechanical workers at the Lengshuijiang Iron and Steel Plant praised them, saying: "Your store is really good, processing so many inexpensive and good-quality foods, which is a great encouragement to us."

　　To adapt to the needs of various periods and aspects, all employees of the Xikuangshan Trading Store have continuously improved supply methods and service quality. Since the beginning of this year, they have successively established 36 new supply points and four catering points. When there was not enough housing, they used dilapidated houses for reconstruction. At the same time, based on the characteristics of the factories and mines, they reorganized the original catering store into three comprehensive catering stores. In November this year, as soon as the rolling mill workshop of the Lengshuijiang Iron and Steel Plant started operation, the store immediately set up a supply point. To further facilitate the masses, since October this year, all employees of the store have organized peddlers, and put forward the slogan of action: "Men are responsible for distant areas, women are responsible for nearby areas, divide the area and contract, and deliver goods to the front line of production in a timely manner." A total of more than 3,400 person-times of delivery were organized. In July this year, a new coal mine was built in Tianzuiwan, and it was inconvenient to establish a supply point for a while, and the employees needed goods very urgently. Liu Zhengfang, the party branch secretary of the store, personally took the burden and led five peddlers to deliver goods to the construction site.

　　Since the National Industrial, Mining, and Forestry Area Supply and Service Work Tongjialiang Store On-site Conference, the Xikuangshan Trading Store immediately launched a competition upsurge of "learning from Tongjialiang, catching up with Tongjialiang, and competing with Tongjialiang." On the original basis, they newly established an underground store and four supply points, and established ten night-shift peddlers to support the front line of production, implementing all-night business and all-night delivery, which was warmly welcomed by the employees. In addition, the store strengthened the leadership and supply work of the original family consignment points, expanding from the original four points to twenty-eight points, which was also greatly welcomed by the families.

　　Thanks to in-depth learning of Tongjialiang's advanced experience, the Xikuangshan Trading Store has achieved a bumper harvest in all aspects of politics and economy. From November 7th to 26th, according to statistics, the entire store received more than 3,700 written commendation opinions and seven congratulatory letters; the sales volume also increased from the original 11,000 yuan per day to more than 18,000 yuan.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The mass movement of "learning from Tongjialiang and catching up with Tongjialiang" to improve supply and service work in industrial and mining areas has been widely carried out in the commercial departments of Fengfeng Mining District, Handan City, Hebei Province. As of now, the commercial departments of the Fengfeng Mining District have set up "underground stores" and "underground restaurants" in nine mines, delivering the food needed by underground workers to the forefront of production, which has been warmly welcomed by the miners, and has powerfully promoted coal production.

　　Ensuring that underground miners can eat food and drink hot soup after intense labor underground is a wish that commercial employees in the Fengfeng Mining District had thought about in the past but had not realized. In early November, Meng Jixiang, director of the Mining Area Service Bureau, returned from the Tongjialiang Store on-site conference held by the Ministry of Commerce and introduced Tongjialiang's experience to the commercial employees of the mining area, which was immediately praised by the majority of commercial employees. They expressed that they wanted to learn from and catch up with "Tongjialiang," and put forward the slogan of "working hard and practically for half a month, establishing underground stores, ensuring good food and drink, and promoting more coal production." In just ten days, "underground stores" or restaurants were established in nine mines, including Wangfeng, Qingnian, and Yangquhe No. 1 Mine. These underground stores or restaurants deliver snacks, fruits, pancakes, baked wheaten cakes, cooked meat, fruit candies, as well as hot tea and hot chicken soup to the "working face" (the front line working area of coal mining) according to the different needs of the miners, and the workers are very moved. Workers in Zhao Faliang's production team at Wangfeng Mine said to the commercial employees: "After drinking the soup, we feel warm in our bodies and warm in our hearts, and we will definitely work harder to produce coal."

　　To further develop the experience of the Tongjialiang Store, the employees of the Fengfeng Mining District, while vigorously developing underground stores, are also vigorously developing mobile stores and mobile service stations in the new urban area and Pengcheng area. At present, there are more than 70 mobile service projects in the district, and the number of service points has reached 589, an increase of 317 compared with the past. In addition, 233 service stations have been organized in conjunction with employees' families and residents. Now the entire mining area provides all kinds of services, from repairing radios to repairing shoes and mending socks.

　　商业紧紧跟上生产跃进步伐
    锡矿山商店职工项项指标完成好服务质量“五满意”
    邯郸峰峰矿区九个矿井设立井下商店和井下饭店
    本报讯　湖南省锡矿山贸易商店在学习山西省大同市口泉区同家梁商店运动中，坚定地执行为工矿生产和职工生活服务的方针，千方百计增辟货源、改善供应方法和服务态度，有力地支援了锡矿山提前三十五天完成1959年度生产计划。商店本身也超额完成了商业进跃计划，成为全省工矿区商业单位中的一面项项指标完成好、服务质量“五满意”的鲜艳红旗。
    锡矿山贸易商店担负着锡矿山、冷水江钢铁厂、金竹山煤矿等九个厂矿数万余人的物资供应工作。由于全店职工鼓足了干劲，战胜了一切困难，取得了物资供应的巨大成绩。
    矿区蔬菜、肉食供应，过去一直是依靠外地，今年以来，商店大搞生产基地，现在这个矿区已喂了三千七百头猪，饲养了三万五千只家禽。为了发展矿区的蔬菜生产，商店还配备了一个专职干部和两个兼职干部专门负责抓蔬菜工作，全矿区的蔬菜播种面积扩大到二千七百多亩，这样全矿区的蔬菜也做到了基本上自给。另外，在副食品加工工作中大闹技术革新，提高劳动效率，使糕点糖果日产由原来七百斤提高到一万斤。在增加副食品供应品种上，充分利用代用品，仅三个月的时间，就生产出糕点、糖果、酒类等各种副食品八万多斤，扩大了供应，满足了矿工需要，工人非常满意。如冷水江铁厂机电工人这样称赞他们：“你们商店真是好，加工出了这样多价廉物美的食品，真是给我们很大的鼓舞。”
    锡矿山贸易商店全体职工为了适应各个时期和各个方面的需要，不断改进供应方法和提高服务质量。今年以来，先后新建立了三十六个供应点和四个饮食点。房子不足，他们就利用破屋改建。同时，他们还根据工矿的特点，把原有的一家饮食商店改组为三个综合饮食店。今年11月，冷水江钢铁厂轧辊车间一开工，商店马上就设立了供应点。为了进一步方便群众，今年10月以来，商店全体职工组织货郎担，并提出了“男包远、女包近，分片包干，及时把商品送上生产第一线”的行动口号。前后共组织送货三千四百多人次。今年7月份，田最湾新建煤矿，一时又不便建立供应点，而职工需要商品又非常迫切，商店党支书刘正芳同志就亲自担起担子，带领五副货郎担送货到工地。
    锡矿山贸易商店自全国工矿林区供应和服务工作同家梁商店现场会议以后，立即掀起了一个“学同家梁，赶同家梁，赛同家梁”的竞赛高潮。他们在原有基础上，又新设了一个井下门市部和四个供应点，并成立了支援生产第一线的夜班货郎担十副，实行通宵营业、通宵送货，受到了职工的热烈欢迎。除此以外，商店还加强了原来家属代销点的领导和供应工作，由原来四个点扩大到二十八个点，家属对此也感到极大欢迎。
    锡矿山贸易商店由于深入地学习了同家梁的先进经验，在政治、经济等各方面都获得了丰收。从11月7日起到26日的统计，全店受到书面表扬意见有三千七百多件，贺信七封；销货额也由原来每天一万一千元上升到一万八千多元。
    本报讯　“学同家梁、赶同家梁”，改进工矿区供应和服务工作的群众性运动，已在河北省邯郸市峰峰矿区商业部门普遍开展。截至目前，峰峰矿区的商业部门，已在九个矿井设立了“井下商店”和“井下饭店”，把井下工人需要的食品送到了生产最前线，受到了矿工的热烈欢迎，有力地促进了煤炭生产。
    保证井下矿工在井下紧张劳动后吃到食物、喝到热汤，是峰峰矿区商业职工过去曾经想到过但没有实现的愿望。11月初，矿区服务局局长孟吉祥从商业部召开的同家梁商店现场会议回来，向本矿区商业职工介绍了同家梁的经验，立刻受到了广大商业职工的赞扬，他们纷纷表示要学、赶“同家梁”，并提出了“苦干实干半月，建立井下商店，保证吃好喝好，促进多产煤炭”的口号。在短短的十几天内，就分别在王凤、青年、羊渠河一矿等九个矿井设立了“井下商店”或饭店。这些井下商店或饭店，都根据矿工的不同需要，把点心、水果、烙饼、烧饼、熟肉、水果糖以及热茶、热鸡子汤等送到采煤“掌子面”（采煤前沿工作区），工人很受感动。王凤矿赵发亮生产班工人对商业职工们说：“喝了汤，暖在身上，热在心上，我们一定加劲出煤。”
    峰峰矿区职工为进一步发展同家梁商店的经验，在大搞井下商店的同时，还在新市区、彭城地区大力发展流动商店、流动服务站。目前全区的流动服务项目达到七十多项，服务点达到五百八十九个，较前增加了三百一十七个。还结合职工家属、居民组织起来了二百三十三个服务站。现在整个矿区从修理收音机到修鞋补袜等，样样服务。
