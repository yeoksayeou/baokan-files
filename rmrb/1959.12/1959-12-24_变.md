　　“Change”
　　Gong Tongwen
    “I used to have a very good impression of him, how could he have made a mistake?”
    “That’s right, he’s changed!”
    There's no need to continue writing this dialogue to see that these two comrades are discussing their "old comrade-in-arms."
    Indeed, back then, the "old comrade-in-arms" had his own "passing five checkpoints and slaying six generals" "heroic deeds." However, now his name is linked to right-leaning opportunist elements. A former "meritorious official" is now a "troublemaker," he's changed!
    What kind of person has he become? He racked his brains to squeeze thirty-two characters together, vividly depicting his spiritual world: "Higher position, smaller responsibility, more benefits, less management, greater power, smaller difficulties, comfortable life, better enjoyment!" As a Communist Party member, he said several "wants" to the Party in one breath, his face is thick to such an extent! "Why were you fragrant meadow grass in the past, and now you are artemisia and wormwood? Is it because of other reasons? It's because you don't like self-cultivation." (Qu Yuan: Li Sao)
    Look how thoughtfully he thinks for himself! Reaching out for position, but afraid of taking responsibility; reaching out for benefits, but too lazy to manage things; reaching out for power, but afraid of difficulties; his purpose is nothing more than "comfortable life, better enjoyment." Can we analyze even a little bit of Party spirit or revolutionary spirit from the minds of such "reaching out faction" members?
    He has changed! He has changed from a revolutionary into a hedonist, he has fallen from the proletarian revolutionary camp into the quagmire of bourgeois individualism.
    His change is not accidental, nor is it sudden.
    I don’t know from which second his revolutionary will began to decline... He doesn’t like to study very much anymore, he really doesn’t like to study anymore, he simply doesn’t study anymore. He doesn’t like criticism and self-criticism very much anymore, he really doesn’t like criticism and self-criticism anymore, he simply puts down the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. In the midst of the hot revolutionary struggle, he yearns for the "tranquility" of a pastoral poet, he is even too lazy to attend Party meetings outside of his eight-hour "work," he has forgotten what he once said when he swore to join the Party, he puts the Party and the people's demands on him "out of consideration," and puts his "demands" (the several "wants" mentioned above) on the Party and the people "into consideration." In this way, it gets worse day by day, until he becomes a right-leaning opportunist.
    It is said that our old comrade-in-arms is now beginning to regret it. We hope he "repents," and especially hope he "changes," hoping that his once-declined revolutionary will will become vigorous again. To turn this hope into reality, in addition to the comrades' "one look, two help," the main thing is to rely on our old comrade-in-arms to straighten his chest, stride forward, and return to the Party's position. Let us one day happily discuss "he has changed again," he has changed from a right-leaning opportunist into a true Marxist-Leninist. This is of great benefit to the Party and to himself.
    Gradual change leads to sudden change. The serious lesson lies in "preventing problems before they arise." We should put a clearly marked sign on the thirty-two-character road that our old comrade-in-arms has traveled, writing the four characters "This road is blocked," and adding three thick and strong exclamation marks!!!

### “变”

　　“变”
　　龚同文
    “我过去对他的印象很好，怎么他也犯了错误？”
    “可不是，他变啦！”
    不必把这种对话继续写下去，就可以看得出这两位同志在议论他们的“老战友”。
    的确，想当年，“老战友”是有过自己的“过五关，斩六将”的“英雄事迹”的。可是，现在他的名字却和右倾机会主义分子联系在一起了。昔日“功臣”，今为“祸首”，他变啦！
    他变成什么样的人了呢？他挖空心思把三十二个字捏在一起，神气活现地描绘了自己的精神世界：“地位要高，责任要小，待遇要多，管事要少，权力要大，困难要小，生活安逸，享受要好！”作为一个共产党员，一口气向党说了几个“要”，其脸之厚，一至如此！“何昔日之芳草兮，今直为此萧艾也？岂其有他故兮？莫好修之害也。”（屈原：离骚）
    看他为自己想的多么周到！伸手要地位，而又害怕负责任；伸手要待遇，而又懒得管事情；伸手要权力，而又害怕困难；其目的无非是为了“生活安逸，享受要好”。我们能在这样的“伸手派”的脑筋里，化验出一点点党性或是一点点革命性吗？
    他变啦！他从一个革命者变成享乐主义者，他从无产阶级革命阵营堕落到资产阶级个人主义的泥坑里去了。
    他的变，不是偶然的，也不是突然的。
    不知道从哪一秒钟起，他的革命意志开始衰退，……他不大喜欢学习了，他很不喜欢学习了，他干脆不学习了。他不大喜欢批评自我批评了，他很不喜欢批评自我批评了，他干脆放下批评自我批评的武器了。他在热火朝天的革命斗争当中，向往田园诗人式的“宁静”，他连八小时“上班”之外的党的会议也懒得参加了，他忘掉了自己在入党宣誓的时候曾经说过什么，他把党和人民对于他的要求“置之度外”，而把他对于党和人民的“要求”（就是上面说的几个“要”）“置之度内”了。就这样，一天不如一天，一直变成一个右倾机会主义分子。
    据说，我们的这位老战友，现在开始后悔了。我们希望他“悔”，尤其希望他“改”，希望他的曾经一度衰退了的革命意志重新旺盛起来。要把这种希望变成事实，除了同志们“一看二帮”之外，主要的还是要靠我们这位老战友自己挺起胸膛，迈开大步，回到党的立场上来。让我们有一天高高兴兴地议论着“他又变啦”，他从一个右倾机会主义分子变成真正的马克思列宁主义者了。这样，对党，对他本人，都是大有好处。
    积渐变而突变。严重的教训，在于“防微杜渐”。我们应当在这位老战友所走过的那种三十二个字的道路上插一块目标鲜明的牌子，写上“此路不通”四个大字，而且加上三个粗粗壮壮的惊叹号！！！
