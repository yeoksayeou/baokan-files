The United States Intensifies Its Use of Turkey to Create a "Cold War"
Zhou Xiuqing

While Eisenhower was visiting Turkey in the guise of a "peace envoy," the Turkish government was stepping up its preparations for war in accordance with the plans of the Central Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On November 17, at the "highest-level meeting" of the heads of government of the three Muslim member states of the Central Treaty Organization held in Tehran, Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, along with Iranian King Pahlavi and Pakistani President Ayub Khan, plotted a conspiracy against Iraq. At the same time, Turkish air and naval forces participated in the joint air and naval "exercises" conducted by the Central Treaty Organization in the Arabian Sea from November 16 to December 4. These facts all demonstrate that Turkey is actively implementing a war policy of following the United States and serving as an aggressive tool for American imperialists in the Middle East.

The predecessor of the Central Treaty Organization was the bankrupt Baghdad Pact Organization. Due to the victory of the Iraqi revolution, this aggressive bloc was on the verge of collapse, dealing a heavy blow to the imperialist policy of aggression against the Middle East. The imperialists, especially the American imperialists, attempted to make up for this failure in the Middle East region by further strengthening their support and control over Turkey, striving to drive Turkey to intensify its war activities in the Middle East region and serve their aggressive policy of undermining the national independence movements of Middle Eastern countries.

To achieve this goal, the United States forced Turkey to implement a larger-scale arms expansion and war preparation policy. The United States has thousands of "experts" and "advisors" in Turkey, who control various government departments and military institutions. While moving the headquarters of the Central Treaty Organization from Baghdad to Ankara, American military figures and fleets frequently visited Turkey, and the United States also held multiple military exercises in Turkey. The United States has a large number of naval, land, and air force bases in Turkey. In July of this year, the United States newly built the most powerful radar center in Turkey at the port of Trabzon in Turkey. At the same time, the United States is also building large-scale military projects in Turkey. In addition to expanding the Black Sea port of Trabzon near the Soviet border, it will also expand the Mediterranean port of Iskenderun near the Syrian region, and build a new Kizile-Hakkari-Siverek highway in southeastern Turkey near Iraq, and a railway from Mus in Turkey to Tabriz in Iran. Obviously, these strategic transportation lines built in Turkey are to facilitate the transportation of heavy military supplies. In addition, the United States has recently reached an agreement with Turkey on the details of establishing American medium-range missile bases on Turkish territory. Not long ago, two hundred Turkish officers who received training in the use of such weapons in the United States returned to Turkey. According to the US-Turkish bilateral military agreement concluded on March 5 this year, the United States can send its troops into Turkey at any time according to "needs". In this way, Turkey has completely become a military aggression base for the United States in the Middle East.

Under the control of the United States, Turkey has now completely embarked on a dangerous path of militarization. Turkey has only 25 million people, but it regularly maintains an army of 500,000, and a reserve army of 2.5 million. More than 60% of Turkey's national budget is allocated to military expenditures each year, and the military budget is increasing year by year. In the 1959-1960 fiscal year, Turkey's defense budget reached 1.146 billion lira, an increase of approximately 181 million lira compared to the 1958-1959 fiscal year. After being bound to the American chariot, Turkey has to rely on American handouts to survive and be led by the nose by the United States.

The dangerous trick played by the Turkish government is mainly aimed at those Middle Eastern countries that uphold national independence, first and foremost Iraq. After the victory of the Iraqi revolution in July last year, Turkish troops gathered on the Iraqi border, posing a military threat to the new Iraqi regime. Grantham, director of the Regional Mutual Assistance Office of the United States Department of Defense, revealed in April this year that the United States has been strengthening Turkey's military potential and providing Turkey with a large amount of military "aid" in order to threaten Iraq. Not long ago, as soon as the news of the assassination of the Iraqi Prime Minister was reported, a large number of American planes flew to Turkish air bases. The Turkish newspapers "Aksam" and "Ulus" both pointed out that this was related to the situation in Iraq. Western news agencies reported that the recent summit of the three Asian countries of the Central Treaty Organization in which Turkey participated, and the subsequent meeting between Turkish Prime Minister Menderes and Pakistani President Ayub, discussed the Iraqi issue and expressed "hope to improve the situation in Iraq." A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman revealed on the 3rd that when Eisenhower arrives in Turkey on the 6th, he will discuss with the Turkish President "the situation in the Middle East and the Central Treaty Organization issue" (Agence France-Presse). It is not difficult to see that the United States is eager to use Turkey to interfere in the situation in Iraq, and Turkey is willing to become a tool for the United States to threaten peace in the Middle East and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. In the eyes of the United States, Turkey is, as United Press International said, "this country is located between the Soviet Union and the Middle East and occupies an important strategic position."

The Turkish ruling clique not only uses Turkish territory as an American aggression base against the Middle East, but also uses its territory as a missile base aimed at the Soviet Union. Ignoring the Soviet Union's proposals for establishing good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey and for complete and thorough disarmament, the Menderes government has densely populated American air bases throughout the Anatolian region, especially in areas close to the Soviet Union. At the beginning of this year, the Soviet State Security Agency uncovered and arrested several batches of American and Turkish spies who had infiltrated the Soviet Union from Turkey. American newspapers also did not shy away from the fact that the missile bases established by the United States on Turkish territory are aimed at the Soviet Union. The "New York Times" clamored: "From the bases in Turkey, American medium-range ballistic missiles can reach any stronghold in the European part of the Soviet Union and most parts of Central Asia."

Turkey's war preparations under the instigation of the United States are a direct threat to peace in the Middle East and the world. Its practice of selling its life for the American policy of aggression has been solemnly condemned by peace-loving people and fair-minded public opinion in the Middle East. The Iraqi "Voice of Free Men" accused Turkey of being directly used to carry out conspiracies against Iraq, and the "Independent" newspaper denounced Turkey for "plotting conspiracies and carrying out provocations to undermine the security of the Iraqi Republic." The people of the Middle East are very clear that Turkey's war preparations are under the direct control and manipulation of the United States. Therefore, the Lebanese "Al-Hawadess" recently pointed out: "Imperialism remains the main enemy of the people of Arab countries, and remains the enemy of national causes and the peace and security of the Arab world." This newspaper believes that imperialism is still carrying out various conspiracies against the Arab people, and the Arab people's struggle against the imperialists is not only not over, but is also very sharp. This is absolutely true.

    美国加紧利用土耳其制造“冷战”
    周修庆
    当艾森豪威尔以“和平使者”的姿态访问土耳其的时候，土耳其政府正在根据中央条约组织和北大西洋公约组织的计划，加紧进行备战活动。11月17日，在德黑兰举行的中央条约组织三个穆斯林成员国政府首脑“最高级会议”上，土耳其总理曼德列斯同伊朗国王巴列维、巴基斯坦总统阿尤布汗策划了反对伊拉克的阴谋。在此同时，土耳其的海空军部队参加了中央条约组织于11月16日到12月4日在阿拉伯海举行的海空军联合“演习”。这些事实都说明，土耳其正积极执行着追随美国的战争政策，充当美帝国主义者在中东的侵略工具。
    中央条约组织的前身是破了产的巴格达条约组织。由于伊拉克革命的胜利，这个侵略集团已濒于垮台，使帝国主义对中东的侵略政策遭到沉重的打击。帝国主义者首先是美帝国主义者妄图弥补它们在中东地区的这个失败，便进一步加强对土耳其的扶植与控制，力图驱使土耳其在中东地区加紧战争活动，为它们破坏中东国家民族独立运动的侵略政策服务。
    为了达到这个目的，美国逼迫土耳其更大规模地执行扩军备战政策。美国在土耳其有着几千“专家”和“顾问”，他们控制着政府各部门和军事机构。在把中央条约组织总部从巴格达搬到安卡拉的同时，美国军事要人和舰队频繁地到土耳其活动，美国还在土耳其举行了多次军事演习。美国在土耳其境内拥有大量的海陆空军基地。今年7月，在土耳其的特拉布松港，美国又新建成了一个在土耳其最强大的雷达中心。同时，美国更在土耳其大规模地兴建军事工程，它除已扩建靠近苏联边境的黑海港口特拉布松外，还将扩建靠近叙利亚地区的地中海港口伊斯肯德伦，并在靠近伊拉克的土耳其东南部建造一条吉兹勒—哈卡里—西韦兰新公路，和一条从土耳其的谟斯到伊朗的大不里士的铁路。很明显，在土耳其修建的这些战略交通线，都是为了便于运输重型军事物资。此外，最近美国还与土耳其就在土耳其领土上建立美国中程导弹基地的细节问题达成了协议。不久前，已有二百名在美国接受使用这种武器训练的土耳其军官回到土耳其。根据今年3月5日缔结的美土双边军事协定，美国可以根据“需要”随时把它的军队开进土耳其。这样，土耳其就彻底变成了美国在中东的一个军事侵略基地。
    在美国的控制下，土耳其现在已经完全走上了军国主义化的危险道路。土耳其只有二千五百万人口，但它却经常保持着一支五十万人的军队，还有一支有二百五十万人的预备军。土耳其的国家预算中，每年有60％以上拨作军费，而且军事预算在逐年增加。1959—1960财政年度内，土耳其的国防预算达十一亿四千六百万里拉，比1958—1959年度约增加一亿八千一百万里拉。土耳其在被缚上了美国的战车之后，就不得不仰赖美国的施舍过活，被美国牵着鼻子走路。
    土耳其政府所玩弄的这种危险把戏，主要是针对中东那些维护民族独立的国家的，首先是针对着伊拉克。在去年7月伊拉克革命胜利后，土耳其的军队曾向伊拉克边境集结，对伊拉克的新政权进行军事威胁。美国国防部地区互助处处长格兰瑟姆今年4月曾透露，美国为威胁伊拉克，一直在加强土耳其的军事潜力，给予土耳其以大量的军事“援助”。不久前，当伊拉克总理被刺的消息刚一传出，大批美国飞机便飞到了土耳其的空军基地。土耳其的“晚报”和“乌卢族报”都曾指出，这同伊拉克的局势有关。而西方通讯社的报道则说，最近土耳其参加的中央条约组织亚洲三国首脑会议以及紧接着举行的土耳其总理曼德列斯和巴基斯坦总统阿尤布之间的会谈，都讨论了伊拉克问题，并表示“希望改善伊拉克的局势”。土耳其外交部发言人3日透露，艾森豪威尔6日到达土耳其访问时，将与土耳其总统讨论“中东的局势和中央条约组织问题”（法新社）。这就不难看出，美国已迫不及待地想利用土耳其来干涉伊拉克的局势，而土耳其则甘愿沦为美国威胁中东和平、进行干涉别国内政的工具了。土耳其在美国的心目中，正如合众国际社所说的：“这个国家位于苏联和中东之间，在战略上占有重要地位。”
    土耳其统治集团不仅把土耳其领土作为美国对中东的侵略基地，而且还把它的领土充作锋芒对着苏联的导弹基地。曼德列斯政府无视苏联为建立苏土两国的睦邻关系和关于全面彻底裁军而提出的建议，在整个安那托里亚地区，特别是靠近苏联地带密布着美国空军基地。今年初，苏联国家保安机关曾破获和逮捕了数批从土耳其潜入苏联的美国和土耳其间谍。美国的报纸也毫不讳言美国在土耳其领土上建立的导弹基地，是针对苏联的。“纽约时报”叫嚣说：“从土耳其的基地，美国的中程弹道导弹能够射到苏联欧洲部分和中亚大部分地区的任何据点。”
    土耳其在美国指使下的备战活动，是对中东和世界和平的直接威胁。它这种为美国侵略政策卖命的作法，受到了中东地区的爱好和平人民和公正舆论的严正谴责。伊拉克“自由人之声报”指责土耳其被直接用来执行反对伊拉克的阴谋，“独立报”则斥责土耳其“策划阴谋和进行挑衅来破坏伊拉克共和国的安全。”中东人民十分清楚，土耳其的备战活动，是处于美国的直接控制与操纵之下的。因此，黎巴嫩“消息周报”最近指出：“帝国主义仍然是阿拉伯各国人民的主要敌人，仍然是民族事业以及阿拉伯世界的和平和安全的敌人。”这家报纸认为，帝国主义仍在对阿拉伯人民进行各种阴谋，阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义者的斗争不仅没有结束，而且还非常尖锐。这是一点不错的。
