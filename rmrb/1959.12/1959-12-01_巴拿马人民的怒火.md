The Wrath of the Panamanian People
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

A fierce storm of opposition to U.S. imperialism is sweeping the Caribbean region. While the Cuban people continue to roar against U.S. interference in their internal affairs and to defend the achievements of the Cuban Revolution, the Panamanian people have also launched a new upsurge in their struggle against the U.S. aggressors. On November 28, despite the obstruction and suppression by U.S. armed personnel, Panamanian masses made a "march for sovereignty" into the Panama Canal Zone occupied by the United States. They shouted the slogan "Yankee Go Home" and demanded the abolition of the unequal U.S.-Panama treaty and the return of Panama's rights over the canal. At the same time, in the capital of Panama, angry masses attacked the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Information Service, and some U.S. enterprises. This is the second large-scale anti-U.S. demonstration that has erupted in Panama in less than a month. The Panamanian people's indomitable and persistent struggle demonstrates their firm determination to defend their national sovereignty.

The unequal U.S.-Panama treaty signed by the United States and Panama in 1903 is a chain imposed on the Panamanian people. This treaty allowed the United States to seize large tracts of Panamanian territory by trickery and coercion, to dig the Panama Canal, and to establish a "state within a state" on Panamanian soil. For more than fifty years, U.S. imperialism has not only used this canal to plunder a large amount of wealth from Panama, but has also used it as a tool to control Panama's national economy and interfere in Panama's internal affairs. The United States enjoys extraterritorial rights in the Panama Canal Zone and practices racial discrimination. The United States engages in political conspiracies and manipulates Panama's political situation. U.S. monopoly capital, like the tentacles of an octopus, controls many important sectors of Panama's national economy, sucking the blood and sweat of the Panamanian people. Although the income and profits of the Panama Canal Company have increased again and again, the rent paid by the United States to the Panamanian government is still less than one-twentieth of the canal's toll revenue. Not only that, but the United States has also turned the land in the Canal Zone into U.S. military bases and the Panamanian seaports into U.S. naval bases. Panama has a population of less than one million, while the United States has 25,000 troops stationed in Panama. All this has seriously infringed upon Panama's independence, undermined Panama's sovereignty, and constrained Panama's socio-economic development. The Panamanian people can no longer tolerate this situation of national humiliation and their struggle against the U.S. aggressors is entirely just. Their struggle will inevitably continue to receive the firm support of the people of Latin American countries and all honest people around the world.

In order to obstruct and undermine the Panamanian people's anti-U.S. struggle, the United States is currently adopting a two-pronged approach, combining both hard and soft tactics. On the one hand, it is constantly putting pressure on the Panamanian government, demanding that it suppress the people. On the other hand, it is hypocritically expressing its willingness to help Panama "develop its economy," attempting to ease anti-U.S. sentiment in Panama. The U.S. government recently sent Undersecretary of State Merchant to Panama to hold negotiations with the Panamanian government. However, judging from the results of the negotiations, the United States is at most prepared to use some small favors to deceive and win over Panama, as it has done in the past, and will never give up its aggressive interests in Panama. Although Merchant outwardly acknowledged the Panamanian government's nominal sovereignty over the Canal Zone, he unreasonably rejected the Panamanian government's legitimate demand to fly the Panamanian flag in the Canal Zone. This shows that the contradiction between the Panamanian people and the U.S. imperialist aggressors can never be resolved in these U.S.-Panama negotiations. As long as the United States does not give up its aggressive interests in Panama, and as long as the Panama Canal does not belong to its true owner, the Panamanian people will never cease their struggle to safeguard their sovereignty and independence. Even some bourgeois newspapers in the United States clearly see this. According to U.S. "Newsweek," in Panama, "the prospect is more intense unrest," and "the wrath of the Panamanians will continue to burn."

Yes, the wrath of the Panamanians will continue to burn, and the wrath of the people of all Latin American countries will continue to burn as well. This wrath will eventually bury the U.S. imperialist colonial enslavement of the Latin American people cleanly and thoroughly!

    巴拿马人民的怒火
    本报评论员
    猛烈的反对美帝国主义风暴正在席卷着加勒比海地区。当古巴人民继续发出反对美国干涉内政、保卫古巴革命成果的吼声时，巴拿马人民也掀起了反对美国侵略者斗争的新高潮。11月28日，巴拿马群众不顾美国武装人员的阻挠和镇压，向美国占领下的巴拿马运河区作了一次“争取主权的进军”。他们高呼“美国鬼滚回去”的口号，要求废除美巴不平等条约，收回巴拿马对运河的权益。同时，在巴拿马首都，愤怒的群众袭击了美国大使馆、美国新闻处和一些美国企业。这是巴拿马在最近不到一个月之内爆发的第二次反美大示威。巴拿马人民这种不屈不挠、再接再厉的斗争，显示了巴拿马人民保卫祖国主权的坚定决心。
    美国在1903年同巴拿马签订的美巴不平等条约，是强加在巴拿马人民身上的一根锁链。这个条约使美国以巧取豪夺的手段霸占了巴拿马的大片领土，开凿了巴拿马运河，在巴拿马的土地上建立了一个“国中之国”。五十多年来，美帝国主义不但利用这条运河从巴拿马掠夺了大量的财富，而且还以此作为控制巴拿马的国计民生、干涉巴拿马内政的一个工具。美国在巴拿马运河区内享有治外法权，实行种族歧视。美国玩弄政治阴谋，操纵巴拿马的政局。美国垄断资本像章鱼的触须一样控制了巴拿马国民经济的许多重要部门，吸吮着巴拿马人民的血汗。尽管巴拿马运河公司的收入和利润一增再增，而美国付给巴拿马政府的租金却仍然不到运河通行费收入的区区二十分之一，不但如此，美国还把运河区的陆地变为美国的军事基地，把巴拿马的海口变为美国的军港。巴拿马全国人口还不到一百万人，而美国驻扎在巴拿马的军队却有二万五千人。所有这一切，都严重地侵犯了巴拿马的独立，破坏了巴拿马的主权，并且束缚了巴拿马社会经济的发展。巴拿马人民对于这种丧权辱国的情况，已经是忍无可忍，他们的反对美国侵略者的斗争完全是正义的。他们的斗争必然会继续得到拉丁美洲各国人民以及全世界一切正直的人民的坚决支持。
    为了阻挠和破坏巴拿马人民的反美斗争，美国目前正在采取软硬兼施、双管齐下的办法。它一方面对巴拿马政府不断施加压力，要求巴拿马政府对人民进行镇压，同时又表示愿意帮助巴拿马“发展经济”的伪善姿态，企图以此来缓和巴拿马的反美情绪。美国政府最近还特地派了副国务卿麦钱特到巴拿马去同巴拿马政府进行谈判。但是从谈判的结果可以看出，美国最多只准备像过去那样再以一些小恩小惠来进行欺骗笼络，而决不会放弃它在巴拿马的侵略利益。虽然麦钱特表面上承认了巴拿马政府对运河区拥有名义上的主权，但是他竟又无理拒绝巴拿马政府提出的在运河区悬挂巴拿马国旗的正当要求。这就说明，巴拿马人民同美帝国主义侵略者之间的矛盾，是决不可能在这次美巴谈判中获得解决的。只要美国一天不放弃它在巴拿马的侵略利益，巴拿马运河一天不归于它的真正主人，巴拿马人民就一天也不会停止维护主权独立的斗争。对于这一点，甚至美国的某些资产阶级报刊也是看得很清楚的。美国“新闻周刊”说，在巴拿马，“前景是更激烈的骚动”，“巴拿马人的怒火还会燃烧”。
    是的，巴拿马人的怒火还要燃烧，整个拉丁美洲各国人民的怒火也将继续燃烧。这个怒火最后必然要把美帝国主义对拉丁美洲人民的殖民奴役干净、彻底地埋葬掉！
