Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, December 17th. The overseas Chinese newspaper "Workers' Road" published a commentary here today, demanding an immediate halt to anti-Chinese activities in Indonesia and a fair and reasonable solution to the overseas Chinese issue in Indonesia based on the suggestions made in the letter from Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio.

The commentary expressed regret and unease over the current anti-China trend in Indonesia and expressed deep concern for the tragic situation of overseas Chinese. The commentary believes that such unfriendly actions towards China in Indonesia are detrimental to the friendly relations between China and Indonesia and are also inconsistent with the ten principles of the Bandung Conference.

The commentary said that it is very strange that some people in Indonesia describe overseas Chinese small traders as "remnants of colonialism." They do not consider the enormous profits that imperialist monopoly capital extracts from Indonesia every year as colonialism, but instead attack overseas Chinese small traders. This is completely turning black and white upside down.

    乌兰巴托华侨报纸发表评论
    要求制止印度尼西亚排华活动
    新华社乌兰巴托17日电　此间华侨报纸“工人之路报”今天发表评论，要求立即制止在印度尼西亚的排华活动，并且根据中国外交部长陈毅写给印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约的信中所提出的建议来公平合理地解决在印度尼西亚的华侨问题。
    评论对目前在印度尼西亚的反华逆流表示遗憾和不安，并对华侨的悲惨处境表示深切的关怀。评论认为，在印度尼西亚发生的这种对中国不友好的行为，有损中国和印度尼西亚两国间的友好关系，同时也不符合万隆会议的十项原则。
    评论说，印度尼西亚的某些人士把华侨小商贩说成是“殖民主义残余”是非常奇怪的。对帝国主义垄断资本每年从印度尼西亚获取暴利，不认为是殖民主义，反而向华侨小商贩开刀，这完全是颠倒黑白。
