Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 2nd: It was announced here today that the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a meeting in mid-November, presided over by President Ho Chi Minh.

Nguyen Van Tran, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, delivered a report on the implementation of the national plan at the meeting. The Council of Ministers believes that thanks to the efforts of workers, peasants, and cadres in the cause of socialist transformation and production construction, especially since the second half of the year, the implementation of the national plan has made great progress. Agricultural production cooperatives have increased to 22,900, accounting for 38.2% of the total number of peasant households. By October 1959, more than 600 industrial, commercial, and mechanical transportation enterprises had implemented joint state-private ownership. Following the bumper harvests in the two crops of last winter and this spring, although many places suffered from drought during the late rice season this year, the average yield per hectare can reach 2,500 kilograms. In the past 9 months, the total output value of state-owned industries increased by 71.2% compared with the same period in 1958. In terms of basic construction, great progress and achievements have been made in transportation, commerce, finance, culture, education, and cadre training.

According to the report of the State Planning Commission, the Council of Ministers decided to adjust some indicators regarding basic construction and foreign trade to meet the requirements of increased production. In order to ensure the successful completion of the 1959 national plan and the three-year plan, the Council of Ministers called on all departments and localities to mobilize the entire people to strive for the successful completion of the plan through vigorous competition.

Ta Quang Buu, Deputy Director of the State Science Commission, delivered a report on the Science Commission. The Council of Ministers believes that since its establishment, the commission has made great efforts in carrying out its work despite encountering many difficulties. Vietnamese scientists are working actively in various institutions of the Science Commission with great enthusiasm. The Council of Ministers encouraged scientific workers to strive to serve the economy and the people's lives, especially the current tasks of the national plan.

The Council of Ministers listened to the report by Bui Quang Tao, Minister of Construction, and Tran Danh Tuyen, Vice Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, on the planning for the reconstruction and expansion of Hanoi. The Council of Ministers approved the resolution on reconstructing and expanding the capital into the political, economic, and cultural center of the country. The Council of Ministers has decided to establish a committee responsible for studying and guiding the construction of the capital Hanoi and other cities, as well as a committee responsible for building the "National Assembly Building."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd: Newspapers here reported today that the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a temporary meeting on November 30, presided over by Chairman Ton Duc Thang, to review the work in November and to formulate new work plans.

The meeting approved a plan for making comprehensive preparations for the upcoming eleventh session of the National Assembly.

At this meeting, the Deputy Minister of Construction reported on the decision of the Council of Ministers regarding the construction of the "National Assembly Building." This decision was warmly welcomed by the meeting.

The meeting listened to a report by a representative of the Central Committee for the Struggle for Reunification of Vietnam on the recent situation in South Vietnam. The report discussed the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's expansion of armaments and war preparations and intensified persecution of the people. The meeting expressed extreme indignation at the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's acts of persecution and retaliation and decided to issue a statement condemning the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's so-called "policy towards former resistance personnel" and the implementation of "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" against former resistance personnel and patriots in South Vietnam.

Finally, the meeting listened to and approved a report on the implementation of the national plan in the past nine months, an estimate of the results of the annual plan, and a report on adjusting some indicators to better suit the production situation and work requirements. The meeting believes that following the new revolutionary atmosphere that emerged in mid-1958, North Vietnam is steadily and rapidly advancing in the development and transformation of the economy and the development of cultural undertakings, following the direction of the resolutions of the 14th session of the Central Committee of the Labor Party and the 9th session of the National Assembly. In the past nine months, the Vietnamese people have overcome many difficulties and achieved many great successes in all aspects, while further gaining rich experience, thereby helping to strengthen the work of formulating and implementing plans in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 2nd: According to reports in newspapers here today, the agricultural cooperativization movement in North Vietnam is developing vigorously. According to incomplete statistics, so far, a total of 1,119,528 households in the entire North Vietnamese countryside have joined 26,270 agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for 41% of the total number of peasant households, with an average of 42 households per agricultural cooperative.

Among the 32 provinces and regions in North Vietnam, more than half of the peasant households have joined agricultural cooperatives in nine provinces and regions, including Vinh Linh, Quang Binh, Thanh Hoa, Phu Tho, Hai Duong, Hoa Binh, Ha Dong, Hung Yen, and Son Tay. Among them, 92% of the peasant households in the Vinh Linh region have participated in agricultural cooperatives. There are a total of 457 townships in North Vietnam that have basically achieved cooperativization. Hung Yen, Ha Dong, Kien An and other provinces have ensured that every township has agricultural cooperatives.

At the beginning of the cooperative construction movement in the spring of this year, there were a total of 16,638 agricultural cooperatives in North Vietnam, accounting for 22.4% of the total number of peasant households. Due to the victory of the rural rectification work and the great debate on the two roads, coupled with the bumper harvest of late rice, a large number of peasant households have joined the cooperatives one after another. For example, in Nam Dinh province, 10.8% of the peasant households used to be in cooperatives, but now it has increased to 35.7%. In Ha Dong province, 17.8% of the peasant households used to be in cooperatives, but now it has increased to 52.7%.
