Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 1st. Pyongyang newspapers today published commentaries to commemorate "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day."

"Rodong Sinmun's" commentary stated, "The imperialists, having been almost completely driven out of Asia, are now engaging in a stubborn struggle to use Africa as the last 'line of defense' for colonialism."

The commentary said that the barbarity, viciousness, and cruelty in methods of the colonialist plunder policy pursued by the imperialists in Africa are absolutely incompatible with human conscience.

The commentary stated that although the colonialists are using appeasement methods while carrying out bestial suppression, they cannot deceive the African people who have deeply experienced the sinister schemes of imperialism. The commentary condemned the U.S. imperialists for using two-faced tactics in Africa.

The commentary said, "All Asian people and peace-loving people around the world stand on the side of the African people. The Korean people warmly support and sympathize with the African people who have risen up to fight for liberation, freedom, and independence, and are convinced that the day is not far off when imperialism will be driven out of the fertile land of Africa."

"Minju Choson's" commentary today stated, "The era of the imperialists running amok in Africa is gone forever. Africa, having broken the chains of colonial enslavement and risen up to fight for freedom and independence, is like a roaring lion." The commentary said, "We believe that with the absolute sympathy and support of the world's peace-loving people, headed by the powerful socialist countries, the African people will certainly be able to drive any imperialism out of the African continent and finally smash the colonialist system."

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 1st. Romanian newspapers published articles supporting the African people's national liberation struggle.

"Free Romania" newspaper's article said that influenced by the victory of the national liberation movement in Asia, millions of Africans have risen up to fight for national independence. Some African countries have already shattered the shackles of colonial enslavement. Under the strong blows of the African national liberation struggle and the pressure of world public opinion, the colonialist countries have been forced to agree to the independence of some countries.

The article concluded by saying that international public supports the liberation struggle of the people of all African countries and demands that imperialism get out of Africa.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 1st. Bulgarian newspapers today published commentaries and articles on "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," warmly supporting the struggle of the people of all African countries for national independence and freedom.

"Rabotnichesko Delo" newspaper's article said that the world is now moving at a rapid pace towards the elimination of the colonialist system. The people of many countries have successively risen up to shatter the chains of colonial enslavement and embarked on the road of freedom and independence. The movement of the people of all African countries to fight for national independence and freedom is flourishing.

The article said that all attempts by imperialism to curb the development of this movement are futile. The people of all African countries have received the support of the people of the socialist camp and progressive world public opinion. They have the African countries that have already embarked on the road to independence as an example and are determined to spare no sacrifice to remove the obstacles set by the colonialists on their road to freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 1st. The Indonesian "People's Daily" today published editorials and articles commemorating "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day."

The article said that the African people have launched a struggle throughout Africa against French, British, American, and Belgian imperialists and colonialists, against racial discrimination in South Africa, and against French nuclear testing in the Sahara. Their struggle has always received the full support of the Asian people and socialist countries. The article pointed out that the national independence movement throughout Africa has accelerated the process of the collapse of imperialism and colonialism.

The article said that the African people who are struggling for national independence have been watching the victory of the Asian people, especially the victory of the socialist countries. Indeed, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have become a beacon guiding the African people to get rid of imperialist and colonialist rule.

The article concluded by saying that the African people's struggle will surely be victorious, and the African people will surely join the ranks of the people who have already become independent.

    美帝国主义在非洲玩弄两面手法骗不了非洲人民
    据新华社平壤1日电　平壤报纸今天为纪念“帝国主义滚出非洲日”发表评论。
    “劳动新闻”的评论说，“在亚洲几乎完全被赶走的帝国主义者为了把非洲当作殖民主义的最后‘防线’正进行着顽固的挣扎。”
    评论说，帝国主义者在非洲推行的殖民地掠夺政策的野蛮、恶毒和方法上的残忍，同人类良心是绝对不能相容的。
    评论说，殖民主义者虽然在进行兽性镇压的同时施用着怀柔方法，但它欺骗不了深深体验到帝国主义的恶毒阴谋的非洲人民。评论谴责美帝国主义者在非洲施用着两面手法。
    评论说，“一切亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民都站在非洲人民这一边。朝鲜人民热烈支持和声援为争取解放、自由和独立而站起来的非洲人民，并确信从富饶的非洲赶走帝国主义的日子不久就将到来。”
    “民主朝鲜报”今天的评论说，“帝国主义者在非洲横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了，挣断殖民奴役的锁链，为争取自由和独立的非洲像怒吼的狮子般地站起来了。”评论说，“我们相信，非洲人民在以强大的社会主义国家为首的世界爱好和平人民的绝对同情和支持下，一定能够从非洲大陆赶走任何帝国主义，并最后地粉碎殖民主义体系。”
    新华社布加勒斯特1日电　罗马尼亚报纸发表文章，支持非洲人民的民族解放斗争。
    “自由罗马尼亚报”的文章说，在亚洲民族解放运动获得胜利的影响下，千百万非洲人起来为民族独立而斗争。有些非洲国家已经打碎了殖民主义的奴役枷锁。在非洲民族解放斗争的强大打击和世界公众舆论的压力下，殖民主义国家被迫同意了一些国家的独立。

    文章说，帝国主义想阻遏这一运动的发展的一切企图都是徒劳的。非洲各国人民得到了社会主义阵营各国人民和世界进步公众的支持。他们有着已走上独立道路的非洲国家为榜样，决心不惜牺牲，破除殖民主义者在他们走向自由的道路上设下的障碍。
    新华社雅加达1日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天发表社论和文章，纪念“帝国主义滚出非洲日”。

    文章说，为民族独立而进行斗争的非洲人民一直注视着亚洲人民的胜利，特别是社会主义国家的胜利。的确，苏联和其他社会主义国家已经成为引导非洲人民摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义统治的灯塔。
    文章最后说，非洲人民的斗争一定会胜利，非洲人民一定会加入已经独立的人民的行列。
