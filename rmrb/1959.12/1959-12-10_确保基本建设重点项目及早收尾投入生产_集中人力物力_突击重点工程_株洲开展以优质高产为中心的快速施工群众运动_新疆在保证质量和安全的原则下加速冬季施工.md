According to the New Hunan Daily, the basic construction front in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, has launched a city-wide mass movement of rapid construction centered on high quality and output, and aimed at ensuring the completion of key projects as soon as possible, greatly accelerating the construction progress. Since August, a total of seventeen key projects, either newly built or expanded, have been fully or partially put into production, ensuring quality. These include the Zhuzhou Coal Preparation Plant, the large flat glass workshop of the Zhuzhou Glass Factory, the Zhuzhou Iron and Steel Plant, the second-phase project of the Zhuzhou Power Plant, the electrothermal station of the Chemical Plant, sixty electrolytic cells of the Zhuzhou Chemical Plant, the copper and lead systems of the Zhuzhou Smelter, the bridge workshop of the Concrete Products Factory, the second water plant with a daily output of 160,000 tons, and the Red Flag No. 2 and No. 3 coke ovens, etc.

Many of the new and expanded projects in Zhuzhou City are urgently needed large-scale enterprises. Ensuring that these key projects are put into production as soon as possible is of great significance for the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Since September, the Zhuzhou Municipal Party Committee has established a command for the completion of key projects, headed by Comrade Liu Zhiyi, the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, to uniformly rank and arrange the city's construction projects on a quarterly and monthly basis. At the construction sites of key projects, both Party A and Party B have jointly established completion project commands to unify thinking, unify strength, and unify command. The Municipal Party Committee has also resolutely criticized the right-leaning fear of difficulty and the erroneous view of neglecting completion work among a few cadres, greatly boosted morale, fully mobilized the masses, and concentrated manpower and material resources to organize a completion assault campaign.

Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, all seven construction enterprises in the city have generally promoted advanced experience in rapid construction since September. The workers of the Provincial Industrial Installation Company, fighting on the Glass Factory construction site, worked day and night in coordination with the civil engineering workers, carrying out staggered construction, promoting advanced experience such as prefabricated installation and overall installation, reducing high-altitude operations, and improving work efficiency by more than one time. In order to ensure that the Second Water Plant supplies water to the new plant as soon as possible, the Second Division of the Fifth Provincial Construction Company concentrated all concrete workers at the Water Plant construction site to carry out three-shift circular operations. In the competition, Chen Zhonglin's team created a new record of pouring 115 cubic meters of concrete per shift, exceeding the quota by 279%. Now, at the key project construction sites undertaken by the Fifth Provincial Construction Company, bricklaying methods such as ladle-type mortar spreaders and double-handed mortar squeezing have been generally promoted, and 80% of auxiliary work has realized horizontal transportation vehicle and vertical transportation mechanization.

In the mass movement of vigorously promoting rapid construction, the workers also fully utilized their creativity, solving difficulties in the completion of projects such as spare parts, non-standard equipment matching, etc. by themselves, greatly accelerating the progress. The workers of the processing plant of the Provincial Industrial Installation Company undertook the task of processing hundreds of tons of spare parts for the Chemical Plant, Coal Preparation Plant, Glass Factory, and Rail Sleeper Plant, as well as the manufacturing of some large-scale non-standard equipment. They had weak technical strength, so they used the method of masters leading apprentices, learning, working, and innovating at the same time. While completing the heavy manufacturing tasks, they also reformed and manufactured 62 machines to arm themselves. For example, riveter He Baoxiang and the workers in his group used a winch to transform it into a simple electric hammer, solving the difficulty of processing the large chute cover of the Chemical Plant, increasing work efficiency by 42 times compared to manual labor. When they accepted the task of processing more than 1,000 kinds of spare parts for the flat glass workshop of the Glass Factory, more than 190 items could not be processed. The workers then modified tools and innovated, not only completely solving the difficulties but also delivering the goods more than ten days ahead of schedule.

In order to ensure that key projects are completed on time or ahead of schedule, all units have comprehensively strengthened enterprise management and vigorously grasped the daily progress. The progress of key projects is uniformly arranged by the Municipal Party Committee, with deadlines for completion. Construction units at all levels delivered tasks, key points, and measures ahead of schedule, handing the bottom line over to the masses. The workers also put forward the slogan of "check on time, make up during the shift, and never owe a debt for the day," allowing only overfulfillment and never owing accounts. Comrade Ao Guohua and other workers from the Electromechanical Installation Company, fighting at the electrothermal station of the Chemical Plant, seized every day and hour when installing the main steam valve, completing the seven-day plan in five days, ensuring power generation at 10 pm on the 28th. Leaders at all levels also further went deep into production, "eating, living, and working together" with the workers, using the "three combinations" method to break through key points. 70% of the cadres and technicians of the Third Division of the Metallurgical Construction Company were stationed at the construction sites.

Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, all factories in the city also greatly promoted the noble style of communist collaboration, with one factory building and everyone supporting it. Through mutual linking, mutual accommodation, and mutual support, the accessories processed by various factories for key projects reached more than 46,000 pieces, and 613 tons of steel and 650 tons of cement were exchanged, adjusted, and supported. Some factories even left the difficulties to themselves and gave the convenience to others. For example, the Xiangjiang Machinery Factory suspended its own lathe manufacturing task to process bearing brackets for the Chemical Plant in order to support the construction of the Chemical Plant. Many construction units also closely cooperated with the construction units, vigorously supporting them. For example, the Smelter organized the factory director to lead the workers to collect pebbles and pick sand on the banks of the Xiangjiang River, meeting the construction needs in a timely manner.

While accelerating the construction and completion of key projects, the city's basic construction front also achieved a comprehensive leap forward with more, faster, better, and more economical results. Five of the seven basic construction enterprises have completed the annual planned workload 38 to 63 days ahead of schedule; the percentage of first-class quality projects delivered in the city is above 95%, costs have generally been reduced by 20%, and labor productivity has increased exponentially. The daily output of civil engineering workers in some units has reached more than 60 yuan, and the daily output of installation workers has reached 140 yuan. Accidents in October have been reduced by eight tenths. These achievements have powerfully broken the right-leaning thought of "grasping completion cannot guarantee workload." The city's annual basic construction workload can be completed one month ahead of schedule.

Urumqi, this newspaper, 9th Dispatch. Recently, construction engineering units in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have implemented the policy of "concentrating forces, ensuring key points, shortening the front, and starting in batches," vigorously grasping finishing projects to ensure the completion of planned targets above quota and putting key projects into production or delivery before the end of the year.

Various construction sites in Xinjiang are carrying out winter construction. There are many major projects under construction. In order to ensure that the key projects to be put into production and delivered this year can be put into production in batches and in stages by the end of the year, the Autonomous Region's Basic Construction Committee recently held a meeting to study this issue and made specific arrangements for the projects to be put into production this year. In addition to giving priority to ensuring finishing projects in terms of manpower, materials, and transportation, many construction units have also established special finishing teams to contract in sections and stages to ensure the thorough completion of finishing projects. The Party committees of various construction engineering units have also strengthened the leadership of finishing work, designating special personnel to be responsible for this work, and ideologically corrected the erroneous view that finishing projects are troublesome and do not have much benefit in conjunction with the anti-Rightist struggle, and launched a competition movement to deliver projects more and faster on the premise of ensuring quality and safety. In the assault on finishing projects, each construction unit first conducted a strict ranking of all construction projects. Some non-key projects and projects that could not be completed at once were temporarily put aside; for those key projects that could be delivered in a short time, delivery plans were formulated, delivery times were limited, and the main forces were concentrated to carry out assaults, adopting the method of fighting annihilation battles, sweeping one batch and then another. In a short period of time, many key engineering projects were put into production and delivered in batches, and the quality met national standards. For example, the construction units undertaking the expansion project of the Mianyi Iron and Steel Plant, the expansion project of the Weihuliang Power Plant, and the Xinjiang Cement Plant, etc., almost stopped all general projects when making a breakthrough in finishing projects, and 100% of the manpower was put into the finishing projects, ensuring that all key projects were put into production on time or ahead of schedule. In particular, after the third-phase expansion project of the Weihuliang Power Plant was put into production one month ahead of schedule, it saved the state an investment of 1.4 million yuan and added 12,000 kilowatts of new electricity to the Autonomous Region, greatly alleviating the tension in electricity use in the Urumqi area. Due to the bottoming out and ranking, the difficulties of material shortages were also resolved in a timely manner. For example, when the Second Regiment of the First Construction Division found that the production capacity of the unit's prefabrication plant could not meet the doors and windows required for all finishing projects, they immediately took measures. In addition to processing and utilizing all the more than 1,000 old doors and windows accumulated in the factory, they also specially organized a door and window finishing team to ensure the timely supply of doors and windows.

At present, the Autonomous Region has completed and put into production or partially put into production more than 100 major projects, of which there are 24 projects above the limit and key projects. Now, workers of all ethnic groups are seizing the last 20 days to make a breakthrough in finishing projects, ensuring that the remaining 10 key projects will be put into production by the end of the year.

    确保基本建设重点项目及早收尾投入生产
    集中人力物力　突击重点工程
    株洲开展以优质高产为中心的快速施工群众运动
    新疆在保证质量和安全的原则下加速冬季施工
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省株洲市基本建设战线通过反右倾鼓干劲，掀起了一个全市性的以优质高产为中心、确保重点抓紧收尾为目标的快速施工群众运动，大大加快了建设进度。8月份以来，兴建和扩建的重点项目全部或部分投入生产的共有十七个，并保证了质量。其中有株洲选煤厂、株洲玻璃厂大型平板车间、株洲钢铁厂、株洲发电厂二期工程和化工厂电热站、株洲化工厂六十个电解槽、株洲冶炼厂的铜、铅系统、混凝土制品厂的桥梁车间、日产十六万吨的第二自来水厂，以及红旗二号、三号焦炉等等。
    株洲市新建扩建的项目多是急需的大型企业，保证这些重点尽快投入生产，对工农业生产继续跃进有重大的意义。9月份以来，中共株洲市委成立了重点工程收尾指挥部，由市委书记刘质毅同志挂帅，按季按月地对全市施工项目统一进行排队和安排。各重点项目的工地，都由甲、乙双方统一成立收尾工程指挥部，统一思想，统一力量，统一指挥。市委还坚决批判了少数干部中的右倾畏难情绪和忽视收尾工作的错误观点，大鼓干劲，充分发动群众，集中人力、物力组织收尾突击战。
    在市委统一领导下，全市七个建筑企业从9月份起，普遍推行了快速施工的先进经验，战斗在玻璃厂工地上的省工业安装公司的职工们，与土建工人拧成一股绳，日夜奋战，交错施工，推行了预制安装和整体安装等先进经验，减少高空作业，提高工效一倍以上。省建五公司二处为了保证第二水厂早日向新厂供水，曾集中全部混凝土工人在水厂工地展开三班循环作业，在竞赛中陈忠林队创造了每班打混凝土一百一十五立方米的新纪录，突破定额279％。现在，省建五公司承建的重点工程工地上，已普遍推行了瓢式铺灰器、双手挤浆等砌砖法，副工有80％实现了水平运输车子化，垂直运输机械化。
    在大搞快速施工的群众运动中，职工们还充分发挥创造性，自己动手解决收尾工程中的配件、非标准设备配套等等困难，大大加快了进度。省工业安装公司加工厂的职工们，担负着化工厂、选煤厂、玻璃厂、轨枕厂等数百吨配件加工任务，和一些大型的非标准设备的制造。他们技术力量薄弱，就以师傅带徒弟，边学边干边革新，在完成繁重的制造任务的同时，还改革和制造了六十二台机具武装自己。如铆工何保祥和本组的工人利用卷扬机改装成一部简易电锤，解决了化工厂大型溜桶盖不能加工的困难，比手工作业提高工效四十二倍。他们在接受玻璃厂平板车间一千多种配件加工任务时，有一百九十多项不能加工，职工们便改工具、闹革新，不仅全部解决了困难，还提前十多天交了货。
    为了保证重点工程按时或提前收尾，各单位全面地加强了企业管理，大抓日进度。重点工程进度由市委统一安排，限期完成。各施工单位从上到下层层提前交任务、交关键、交措施，把底交给群众，工人们也提出了“时查、班补、日不欠”的口号，只许超额，决不欠账。战斗在化工厂电热站的机电安装公司工人敖国华等同志，在安装主蒸汽门时，日日时时抓紧，七天计划五天完成，保证了28日晚十时发电。各级领导也进一步深入生产，与工人“同吃同住同劳动”，用“三结合”办法突破关键，冶建公司三处就有70％的干部和技术人员驻守工地。
    在市委统一领导下，全市各工厂还大大发扬了共产主义大协作的高尚风格，一厂建设，大家支援，通过互相挂钩，互通有无，各工厂为重点工程加工的配件达四万六千多件，斢换、调剂、支援了钢材六百一十三吨、水泥六百五十吨。有的工厂还把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，如湘江机器厂为了支援化工厂建设，曾把本身的车床制造任务暂停为化工厂加工轴承支架。许多建设单位更是与施工单位亲密合作，大力支援，如冶炼厂即由厂长带领工人，到湘江河边捞卵石，挑砂子，及时满足施工需要。
    全市基本建设战线在加快重点工程建设和收尾的同时，还实现了多快好省地全面跃进，七个基建企业已有五个提前三十八到六十三天完成全年计划工作量；全市交工的工程一级品占95％以上，成本普遍降低20％，劳动生产率成倍提高，有的单位土建工人日产达六十多元，安装工人日产达一百四十元。10月份事故已降低十分之八。这些成就，有力地打破了“抓收尾就不能保工作量”的右倾思想。全市全年基建工作量可提前一月完成。
    本报乌鲁木齐9日电　最近以来，新疆维吾尔自治区建筑工程单位，贯彻执行“集中力量，保证重点，缩短战线，分批上马”的方针，大抓结尾工程，保证完成原订计划限额以上和重点项目年底以前投入生产或交付使用。
    新疆各建筑工地都在进行冬季施工，正在施工的主要项目不少，为了保证今年要投入生产和交付使用的重点项目，到年底能够分批、分期地投入生产，最近，自治区基本建设委员会开会研究了这个问题，对今年要投入生产的工程作了具体安排。许多施工单位除在人力、物力和运输方面优先保证结尾工程外，并成立了专门的结尾队，分片、分期包干，确保结尾工程完善彻底。各建筑工程单位党委也都加强了结尾工作的领导，指定专人负责这项工作，并结合反右倾斗争从思想上纠正了认为结尾工程很麻烦，油水也不大等错误的看法，并在保证质量和安全的前提下，掀起多交工、快交工的竞赛运动。在突击结尾工程中，各施工单位首先对所有施工项目进行了严格的排队，对一些非重点工程和一下不能完成的工程，就暂时放一下；对那些短时间可以交工的重点项目，就编制交工计划，限定交工时间，集中主要力量进行突击，采取打歼灭战的办法，扫完一批再来一批。在不长的时间内，就使许多重点工程项目分批投入生产和交付使用，而且质量合乎国家标准。例如，担任冕一钢铁厂扩建工程、苇湖梁发电厂扩建工程和新疆水泥厂等工程的建筑单位，在突击结尾工程时，几乎把所有一般工程都停了下来，百分之一百的人力都投入到了结尾工程上，保证各项重点项目都按时或提前投入生产。特别是苇湖梁发电厂三期扩建工程提前一个月投入生产以后，为国家节约投资一百四十万元，给自治区新增电力一万二千瓩，大大缓和了乌鲁木齐地区用电紧张的状况。由于经过摸底排队，对材料缺乏的困难，也及时进行了解决。如建工一师二团发现本单位预制厂的生产能力不能满足全部收尾工程所需要的门窗，他们就立即采取措施，除把厂里积存的一千多个旧门窗全部加工利用外，并且专门组织了门窗收尾队，保证门窗按时供应。
    目前自治区已建成投入生产或部分投入生产的主要工程已有一百多项，其中限额以上和重点工程项目就有二十四个。现在，各族职工正抓紧最后二十天的时间，突击结尾工程，保证下余的十个重点项目，到年底一定投入生产。（附图片）
