Over Half a Century Old, Still Struggling to Make a Living; Toiling a Lifetime, Unable to Enjoy Old Age
Fifteen Million American Elderly Impoverished

　　One-twelfth of the American population, fifteen million American citizens aged sixty-five and over, face severe material difficulties and live in hardship and poverty in the New Year.

　　A recent investigation by the Senate Subcommittee on Aging revealed that in the United States, three-fifths of the elderly aged sixty-five and over have an annual income of less than $1,000, a figure significantly lower than the officially published minimum cost of living. Approximately 500,000 elderly American widows have to rely on an average monthly pension of $45 to survive; according to official statistics, a single, non-working woman needs at least $1,596 per year, or $133 per month, to survive.

　　Committee members heard similar complaints in various cities: We cannot live on our pensions; if we get sick, we have nothing to eat, because we cannot afford both food and medical treatment with this little money.

　　The "Washington Post and Times Herald" recently wrote that the specter of insecurity for the elderly "is haunting all strata of our society."

　　Panontino, president of the American Association of Retired Professors, wrote in this newspaper that according to the association's precise statistics, 3,617 retired professors receiving pensions have an average monthly income of only $166. Some professors can only afford one meal a day. Some are even forced to work as doormen and night watchmen. He wrote: "We have a very distinguished English teacher who has nurtured many outstanding contemporary writers, and now he is selling illustrated postcards. We have a faculty member who has been nominated three times for the Nobel Prize for his outstanding achievements but now lives on $125 a month. I have a letter from him here—probably his last letter—in which he says he is worried about not being able to afford medical expenses." However, a report on the state of the elderly received by the U.S. government from the Federal Council stated that the problems faced by the elderly are their personal affairs. The report also stated that "the basic principle of a society composed of free and independent individuals is that each member of society should find their own way to solve their own problems."

### 年过半百要为糊口奔波  劳苦一世不能安度晚年  美国一千五百万老人穷困潦倒

　　年过半百要为糊口奔波  劳苦一世不能安度晚年
    美国一千五百万老人穷困潦倒
    占美国人口十二分之一的年龄在六十五岁和六十五岁以上的一千五百万美国公民，在新的一年中正面临着严重的物质困难，过着艰难穷困的生活。
    参议院老年问题小组委员会最近的调查表明，在美国，有五分之三的六十五岁和六十五岁以上的老年人，全年的收入不到一千美元，这个数字显著低于官方公布的最低生活费用。美国大约有五十万老年寡妇不得不依靠每月平均四十五美元的养老金来维持生活；而根据官方统计，一个没有劳动力的单身妇女，要维持生活，每年至少需要一千五百九十六美元，即每月一百三十三美元。
    委员会委员们在各城市听到了同样的一些控诉：我们靠领取养老金无法维持生活，如果我们一生病，就没有吃的了，因为靠这点钱不能够同时又顾上吃饭又顾上治病。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”不久前写道，老年人无保障的魔影“在跟踪着我们社会的所有阶层”。
    美国退休教授联合会会长帕农提诺在这家报纸上写道，根据联合会的精确统计，三千六百一十七个领养老金的大学教授每月平均收入只有一百六十六美元。有的教授每天只能吃一顿。有些还被迫去做看门人和夜间守卫者。他写道：“我们有一个很卓越的英语教师，培养出了许多当代的卓越作家，而现在他却在那里卖带画的明信片。我们有一个教员由于有杰出的功绩，曾经三次被提名为领取诺贝尔奖金的候选人，但现在却靠每个月领一百二十五元过活。我这里有他一封信——可能是他的最后一封信——信中说，他正在为付不起医疗费而担忧。”可是，美国政府收到的联邦委员会关于老年状况的报告竟说，老年人所遇到的问题是他们私人的事情。报告还说，“自由和独立自主的人组成的社会的基本原则是：社会的每个成员应当自己找到解决自己问题的办法。”　（新华社讯）
