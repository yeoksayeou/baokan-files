    Commentary by our correspondent:
    U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's visit to Pakistan after visiting Turkey, and his upcoming visit to Iran, is noteworthy as he tours all the Asian member states of the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) during this overseas trip.
    Recently, the United States has been intensifying its direct control over CENTO to strengthen its chain of aggression in the so-called "Northern Tier" region. After the Iraqi revolution disrupted the backbone of the "Northern Tier" group last year, the United States came forward to fully maintain this Western military aggression system that was on the verge of collapse. In March of this year, the United States signed bilateral military agreements with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, respectively. In October, the CENTO Council meeting was held in Washington for the first time. Although the United States is not formally a member state of this group on the surface, it has actually completely manipulated the organization, especially tightly controlling its military apparatus. The Military Committee of this organization will be chaired by an American next year. At the same time, the newly established permanent military representative group will begin operations in the Turkish capital from January 1st next year, and the post of chief of staff of the group will also be occupied by an American. This permanent group is in fact the prototype of a CENTO "Joint Command," and it will also further formulate the details for the formal establishment of a "Joint Command" under the auspices of the United States.
    The British newspaper "The Guardian" recently pointed out that "the United States' interest in CENTO's military plans has been growing." This "interest" of the United States is primarily manifested in the establishment of more U.S. military bases, especially medium-range missile bases, on the territories of CENTO's Asian member states. At the end of October, the United States formally announced that it had reached a detailed agreement with Turkey on establishing medium-range missile bases on Turkish territory. In fact, the work of constructing such bases in the territories of Turkey, Iran, and other countries has already been carried out secretly. The intention of the United States in attaching so much importance to this region bordering socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, and in intensifying the deployment of missile base networks around socialist countries, is self-evident. The U.S. "New York Times" openly stated that Turkey is one of the "most important bases" of the United States overseas, and that "from bases in Turkey, U.S. medium-range missiles can reach any stronghold in the European part and most of Central Asia of the Soviet Union." Pakistan's "Dawn" also clamored that "in the future, Russia may become" the target of attacks from the bases and missile launch sites being built in Pakistan.
    Under the command of the United States, CENTO has successively held air force exercises in Iran and Pakistan, and large-scale joint naval and air force exercises in the Arabian Sea since November. It has been announced that other military exercises will be held before the end of this year. This organization also wants to establish a "joint standing army" and wants these Asian member states to provide more cannon fodder in the new wars of aggression prepared by the United States. These facts have shown why the ruling group in the United States is so concerned about Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran, and what kind of peace they are peddling!
    From the Baghdad Pact to CENTO, the imperialist countries headed by the United States have consistently used this chain of aggression to suppress the Arab national independence movement. At present, they are still primarily concentrating on opposing Iraq. According to Western news agencies, the heads of government of Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan recently discussed the "Iraq issue" at a meeting in Tehran. As the Iraqi newspaper "Voice of Free Men" pointed out, these activities show that the imperialists are instigating the Muslim member states of CENTO to take greater "responsibility" in the conspiracy against Iraq.
    CENTO also continues to be used by the United States to exert pressure on some South Asian countries, attempting to make them change their neutral foreign policy and ultimately pull them into Western military blocs. Pakistani President Ayub Khan recently expressed his hope at the CENTO Tehran meeting that Afghanistan would join CENTO. In response, Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammed Naim Khan has once again stated that Afghanistan pursues a neutral policy and does not participate in military blocs. At the same time, in coordination with the frenzied propaganda in the American press calling for India to change its neutral policy, Pakistani government leaders have repeatedly touted that India should form a military alliance with Pakistan. When the U.S. "Newsweek" explained the nature of this alliance from the sidelines, it wrote, "If Pakistan continues to be protected by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, CENTO, and its bilateral agreements with the United States," then "India, as Pakistan's military ally, would also be protected." It is very clear that the United States' enthusiasm for intensifying the activities of the CENTO aggression chain contains a serious threat to the security of independent Asian countries.

### 严重威胁亚洲独立国家的安全  美国加强中东侵略锁链

    严重威胁亚洲独立国家的安全
    美国加强中东侵略锁链
    新华社8日讯　本社记者述评：
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在访问土耳其后，到达巴基斯坦，还将去伊朗。艾森豪威尔在这次出国访问的路程中，巡行中央条约组织所有的亚洲成员国，这是引人注意的。
    最近一个时期，美国在加紧直接地控制中央条约组织，以加强在美国所谓“北层”地区的侵略锁链。去年伊拉克革命打断了“北层”集团的脊骨以后，美国便出来全力维持这个濒于瓦解的西方军事侵略体系。今年3月，美国同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦分别签订了双边军事协定。10月，中央条约组织理事会会议第一次在华盛顿召开。美国虽然表面上还不是这个集团的正式成员国，但实际上它已经完全操纵了这个组织，特别是严密地控制了这个组织的军事机构。这个组织的军事委员会明年将由美国人担任主席。同时，新建立的常设军事代表小组将从明年1月1日起在土耳其首都开始活动，小组参谋长一职也由美国人占据。这个常设小组事实上已是中央条约组织“联合司令部”的雏形，它还将在美国主持下进一步拟订正式成立“联合司令部”的细节。
    英国人出版的“卫报”最近指出，“美国对中央条约组织的军事计划的兴趣已愈来愈大”。美国的这种“兴趣”首先表现于在中央条约组织各亚洲成员国的领土上建立更多的美国军事基地，特别是中程导弹基地。10月底，美国已正式宣布同土耳其达成在土耳其领土上建立中程导弹基地的细节协议。而实际的情况是，在土耳其、伊朗等国领土上建筑这种基地的工作，早已秘密进行。美国如此重视这个毗邻苏联等社会主义国家的地区，这样加紧在社会主义国家周围建立导弹基地网的部署，其用心所在是不问便知的。美国“纽约时报”公开说过，土耳其是美国海外“最重要的根据地之一”，“从土耳其的基地，美国的中程导弹能够射到苏联欧洲部分和中亚大部分地区的任何据点”。巴基斯坦“黎明报”也叫嚷，“将来俄国可能成为”正在巴基斯坦建筑中的基地和导弹发射场的攻击的靶子。
    中央条约组织在美国指挥下，11月来，已接连在伊朗和巴基斯坦举行过空军演习，在阿拉伯海举行过大规模海空军联合演习。据宣布，在今年年底以前还将举行另外的军事演习。这个组织还要建立“联合常备军”，要这些亚洲成员国在美国准备的新侵略战争中提供更多的炮灰。这些事实已说明美国统治集团目前为什么这样关切土、巴、伊三国，而他们兜售的又是一种什么和平！
    从巴格达条约到中央条约组织，以美国为首的帝国主义国家一贯利用这道侵略锁链来镇压阿拉伯民族独立运动。目前它们仍然在首先集中反对伊拉克。据西方通讯社透露，伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦三国政府首脑最近在德黑兰会议上讨论了“伊拉克问题”。正如伊拉克“自由人之声报”指出，这些活动表明，帝国主义者正在唆使中央条约组织的穆斯林成员国在反对伊拉克的阴谋中尽更大的“责任”。
    中央条约组织也继续被美国利用来对某些南亚国家施加压力，企图使它们改变中立外交政策，把它们最后拉入西方军事集团。巴基斯坦总统阿尤布汗不久前在中央条约组织德黑兰会议上又表示希望阿富汗参加中央条约组织。对此，阿富汗外交大臣穆罕默德·纳伊姆汗已再次声明阿富汗奉行中立政策，不参加军事集团。同时，配合着美国报刊要印度改变中立政策的狂热宣传，巴基斯坦政府领导人也一再大肆鼓吹印度应同巴基斯坦缔结军事联盟。美国“新闻周刊”从旁解释这种联盟的性质时写道，“如果巴基斯坦继续受到东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织以及它同美国的双边协定的保护的话”、“那么印度作为巴基斯坦的军事同盟国就也会受到保护”。事情很明白，美国热中于加紧中央条约组织侵略锁链的活动，包含着对亚洲独立国家的安全的严重威胁。
