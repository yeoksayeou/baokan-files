    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 2nd: Tibet is strengthening the work of preventing and controlling livestock diseases in order to create favorable conditions for the development of animal husbandry.
    In the past six months or so, the number of animal husbandry and veterinary technicians in the region has increased by nearly one and a half times compared to before. Veterinary prevention and control stations have been added in pastoral areas such as Ali and Damxung, and in Zêtang, Nyingchi, and Maizhokunggar. The Lhasa Serum Factory has produced a large number of bovine pleuropneumonia vaccines, and has also successfully tested a method of preserving this vaccine for a relatively long period by inoculating sheep, which has solved the problem of the vaccine's short shelf life in the past. In order to meet the needs of animal husbandry development, the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Department of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has decided to hold a number of primary veterinary personnel training courses in Tibet. Some training courses have already started, and some are about to begin.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 2nd: Tibet has begun to establish a number of state-owned farms and ranches. In addition to developing agriculture, animal husbandry, and diversified sideline production, these farms and ranches will become demonstration sites to help the vast number of Tibetan farmers who have been liberated improve their farming techniques.
    The Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Department of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region will soon begin construction of two farms and ranches in Qushui County and Dagzê County. The original agricultural experimental farm in the western suburbs of Lhasa has been decided to merge with the newly built Lhasa Ranch, and gradually build it into a comprehensive experimental farm for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. A farm is also being built in the Tagong area.

    西藏加强牲畜疫病防治工作
    筹建一批农牧场帮助藏民改进耕作技术
    据新华社拉萨2日电　西藏地区正在加强防治牲畜疫病的工作，为发展畜牧业生产创造有利条件。
    近半年多来，全区畜牧兽医技术人员，比以前增加近一倍半。在阿里、当雄等牧区和泽当、林芝、墨竹工卡等地，增设了兽医防治站。拉萨血清厂已大量制造牛胸膜肺炎疫苗，还试验成功了用绵羊接种而较长期地保存这种疫苗的方法，解决了过去这种疫苗保存期过短的问题。为了满足畜牧业发展的需要，西藏自治区筹委会农牧处决定在西藏举办一些初级兽医人员训练班，有的训练班已经开学，有的即将开始。
    据新华社拉萨2日电　西藏地区着手建立一批国营农牧场。这批农牧场除了发展农牧业和多种副业生产以外，将成为帮助翻身后的西藏广大农民改进耕作技术的示范场地。
    自治区筹备委员会农牧处即将着手在曲水县和达孜县兴建两个农牧场。拉萨西郊原有的农业试验场，已决定和新建的拉萨牧场合并，逐步建设成农林牧副渔综合试验场。塔工地区也在建设一座农场。
