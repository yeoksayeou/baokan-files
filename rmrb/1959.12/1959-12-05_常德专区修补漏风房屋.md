Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 3rd: While vigorously promoting winter production, the Changde Special Zone in Hunan Province has made careful arrangements for the winter lives of the masses.

Most counties in the Changde area are located on the shores of Dongting Lake, and firewood is very scarce. The masses mostly live in thatched houses, which are prone to leaks. Over the years, Party committees at all levels have made ensuring that the masses stay warm in winter a major task.

Not long ago, the region conducted a general inspection of residential housing. For houses needing repair, efforts were organized to repair them quickly. More than 140,000 rooms have now been repaired. The Sanyantang Commune in Yuanjiang County organized more than 250 carpenters and bamboo craftsmen to make rounds for repairs, and adopted the method of masters teaching apprentices to teach the masses how to repair houses. The problem of materials needed for housing repairs was solved by relying on the masses to use old materials and local methods. In this way, 75% of the 9,800 houses that needed repair in the entire commune have been repaired.

    常德专区修补漏风房屋
    据新华社长沙3日电　湖南省常德专区在大抓冬季生产的同时，周密地安排了群众冬季生活。
    常德地区各县大多位于洞庭湖滨，柴源很缺，群众多是住的茅房，容易漏风。历年来，各级党委都把抓好群众的御寒取暖当做一件大事来抓。
    不久以前全区对居民住房普遍进行了一次检查。对需要修建的房子，组织力量突击修建，现已修建好十四万多间。沅江县三眼堂公社组织了二百五十多个木工、篾工巡回修理，并且采取师傅带徒弟的办法教会群众修补房子。住房所需材料问题，依靠群众用旧料，用土办法来解决。这样，全社应修补的九千八百间房子已修好了75％。
