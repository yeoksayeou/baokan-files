The day the production team held its evening party, it happened to be a force five wind, and the weather was very cold, but the atmosphere on and off the stage was fiery. During the party, an old woman walked onto the stage. She was an ordinary rural old woman, wearing a headscarf and draped in a new cotton coat. The announcer said:
    “Now, please let old woman Li Yuming sing us a song!”
  I grew up in the countryside, and even after entering the city, I still had occasional contact with the countryside. Before liberation, such old women only revolved around the stove. In the early days of liberation, such old women only stepped onto the podium to denounce landlords. As for performing on stage, it was still new to me, so emotionally I had an uncontrollable excitement. Old woman Li Yuming stood on the stage, and before she even opened her mouth to sing, unexpectedly, she said with emotion:
    “The people’s commune is good! Production is good! Life is good! The canteen is good! The canteen is convenient, and the food is hot. I’m not feeling well today, and my voice isn’t very good, but I can’t hold back, I still have to come on stage and sing…!”
    The force five wind was blowing. The stage in front of me suddenly seemed to expand. This fifty-three-year-old, medium-height old woman Li Yuming stood there巍峨(wēi é - towering, majestic). She was proclaiming, she was proclaiming to the world. She was proclaiming her feelings, she was proclaiming her worldview, she was proclaiming her beliefs. She did not consciously refute the slanders of the imperialist elements against the people’s commune, but she heavily rebuffed our common enemy. Her song was not accompanied by an orchestra, but by the hearts of our 650 million people.
    Soon, I saw old woman Li Yuming a second time, by the Yongding River. By chance, it was another force five wind. On the riverbank, the shallow shoals were frozen, the ground was frozen half a foot deep, and the cold was biting. Old woman Li Yuming and the commune members were together, sifting gravel for a hydroelectric station project. People asked her if she was cold, and the old woman smiled and replied that she wasn't. Moreover, she sang a little tune while picking out stones.
    Old woman Li Yuming has three sons. One is an officer in the People's Liberation Army, one is a schoolteacher, and one is the captain of the production team. All three sons love her, but she is unwilling to enjoy the ready-made blessings of a mother, and has been working in the production team. She enthusiastically responds to the calls of the Party. Her heart is firmly connected with the Party's cause.
    The force five wind was blowing. Old woman Li Yuming bent over, selecting stones. When she straightened up, I saw her face full of sweat, shining brightly. It made people feel that this was not winter, but spring. This was not an old person, but a young person with vibrant life. This is not only a Chinese rural woman with a hardworking tradition, but also a powerful Chinese rural woman with socialist consciousness.
    For the Western world, they cannot understand such ordinary women, nor is it possible for them to understand. In their minds full of exploitation and the class nature of aggression, there is the view of “money is almighty.” Therefore, American imperialism uses "US dollars" or so-called "US aid" to enslave the people of colonial countries. They fear a strong China, so they can only raise their weapons like Don Quixote and curse our Great Leap Forward like witches.
    Old woman Li Yuming stands here, the Chinese working people stand here. Who forced them to come! The landlord class forced them. It was they who, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, eliminated this class. Chiang Kai-shek forced them. It was they who, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, drove Chiang Kai-shek out of the mainland. Whoever plunders them, whoever exploits them, whoever forces them, will be buried by them in history. Therefore, old woman Li Yuming knows, and tens of millions of Chinese working people know, that for a bright future, they are seizing time, chasing time, and contributing what they can.
    By the Yongding River, the mother of three good sons, an ordinary Chinese woman, together with her fellow villagers, like her fellow villagers, contributes her heat and light to socialism.

    用歌唱回击诬蔑
    巴波
    生产队举行晚会这天，碰上五级大风，天气很冷，台上台下，却一片火热。晚会进行中，一个老大娘走上舞台，这是一个平平常常的农村老大娘，包着头巾，披着一件新棉大衣。报幕人说：
    “现在，请李玉明老大娘给我们唱一个歌！”
  我是在农村长大的，进入城市后也不时跟农村有接触。解放前，这样的老大娘只有围着锅台转，解放初期，这样的老大娘控诉地主才登上了讲台，至于上舞台表演，对我还是新事，因此感情上有一种按捺不住的激动。李玉明老大娘站在台上，没有一张嘴就唱，出人意外的，她充满了感情地说：
    “人民公社就是好！生产好！生活好！食堂好！食堂方便，吃得热火。我今天人不大舒服，嗓子不大好，我憋不住，还是要上台来唱一唱……！”
    五级风刮着。我眼前的舞台，顿时仿佛扩大起来。这个五十三岁、中等身材的李玉明老大娘，巍峨的矗立在那儿。她在宣告，她在向世界宣告。她在宣告她的感情，她在宣告她的世界观，她在宣告她的信念。她没有意识地去回击那些帝国主义分子对人民公社的诬蔑，然而，她重重地回击了我们共同的敌人。她的歌，不是一个乐队在伴奏，而是我们六亿五千万人在心灵上为她伴奏。
    不久，我第二次见着李玉明老大娘，是在永定河边。无巧不巧，又是五级大风。河边上，冰封浅滩，地冻半尺，寒气刺骨。李玉明老大娘和社员们一起，在为一个水电站工程筛石子。人们问她老人家冷不冷，老大娘笑着回答说不冷。而且，她一边挑选石子，一边唱着小曲。
    李玉明老大娘有三个儿子。一个是解放军的军官，一个是学校教员，一个是生产队的队长。这三个儿子都爱她，她却不愿享作母亲的现成福，一直在生产队里劳动。党的号召，她都热烈响应。她的心和党的事业，牢牢地拧在一起。
    五级风刮着。李玉明老大娘弯着腰，选择着石子。当她直起腰来的时候，我看见她满脸汗光，在闪闪发亮。使人感到，这不是冬天，而是春天。这不是老年人，而是生命焕发的青年。这不仅是一个有着勤劳传统的中国农村妇女，而且是有着社会主义觉悟的强大的中国农村妇女。
    对于西方世界来说，这样平平常常的妇女，他们是无法理解的，也不可能理解。在他们满脑子剥削思想和侵略成性的阶级本质中，有的是“金钱万能”观。因此，美帝国主义用“美金”或叫“美援”，奴役着殖民地国家的人民。他们惧怕一个富强的中国，因此他们只好像唐·吉呵德式的举起武器，像巫婆一样咒骂我们的大跃进了。
    李玉明老大娘站在这里，中国劳动人民站在这里。谁强迫她们来着！地主阶级强迫过。就是她们，在中国共产党领导下，消灭了这个阶级。蒋介石强迫过。就是她们，在中国共产党领导下，把蒋介石从大陆上赶了出去。谁掠夺她们，谁剥削她们，谁强迫她们，谁就被她们从历史上葬送。因此，李玉明老大娘知道，千千万万的中国劳动人民知道，为了美好前途，抢着时间，追赶着时间，贡献出自己所能贡献的力量。
    永定河边，三个好儿子的母亲，一个普通的中国妇女，和她的乡亲们一起，和她的乡亲们一样，为社会主义贡献出她的热和光。
