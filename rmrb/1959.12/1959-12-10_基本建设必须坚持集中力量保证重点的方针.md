    This year, the national basic construction departments, in accordance with the Party's construction policy of concentrating forces and guaranteeing key projects, rationally ranked construction projects according to their importance and urgency at the beginning of the year. In design and construction, they universally adopted the method of focusing on key projects, launching phased and batch-by-batch assaults, and finishing one batch before starting another. As a result, very good results were achieved. Key projects were fully guaranteed in terms of manpower and materials, and a large number of important projects accelerated their construction speed and were completed and put into production on time or ahead of schedule. Industrial production thus timely received a large number of new forces, rapidly expanded production capacity, and played a major role in completing this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. For example, Beijing City, due to the implementation of the policy of concentrating superior forces to guarantee key projects and implementing the method of fighting battles of annihilation in phases and batches, dozens of important industrial projects such as the Coking Chemical Plant and the Synthetic Fiber Plant, as well as a batch of large-scale public buildings such as the Great Hall of the People and the Beijing Railway Station, were completed ahead of schedule. In the construction of a large enterprise, the method of concentrating forces to complete a batch of projects and then another batch of projects has also achieved great results. For example, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) adopted the method of phased assaults this year, first concentrating its main forces on the construction of the ironmaking system projects, and then concentrating its superior forces on the construction of steelmaking projects, so that thirteen major projects such as No. 2 blast furnace, No. 1 open hearth furnace, No. 2 open hearth furnace, as well as ore dressing, sintering, and coking, were completed and put into production ahead of schedule. Due to the on-time or early completion of key projects and their entry into production, more favorable conditions were provided for the construction of non-key projects. A large number of non-key necessary projects have also been rapidly constructed. Concentrating superior forces for phased construction also better ensured project quality. As construction speed increased, project costs also decreased. It can be seen that concentrating forces and guaranteeing key projects is a correct policy that can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    One of the main experiences of concentrating forces to guarantee key projects is to focus on projects put into production on a quarterly and monthly basis. After the date for putting into production (or delivery for use) is specified, specific measures must be taken to complete it on schedule, only ahead of time and not postponed. Because the purpose of basic construction is to rapidly increase production capacity, grasping projects put into production on a quarterly and monthly basis can guarantee the most important of the key projects.
    Next year, the basic construction front will be in a situation of continued great leap forward. In some departments, the proportion of newly built projects put into production in next year's total output value has increased, which shows that next year's basic construction tasks are more important. How to complete next year's basic construction tasks well? The fundamental link is still to implement the construction policy of concentrating forces and guaranteeing key projects.
    In order to accelerate the change of our country's "poor and blank" face, we need to construct a lot of projects. What policy should we adopt to accelerate construction? One policy is to go all out and advance simultaneously. Practice has proved that this is counterproductive. Because in a certain period of time, manpower and material resources are always limited, and technical forces, building materials, and equipment supply cannot meet the needs of all aspects at the same time. If this method is adopted, manpower, materials, and equipment will inevitably be used in a scattered manner, and as a result, all projects will have their construction periods dragged out for a long time, and the investment effect cannot be quickly realized. This is an invisible but significant waste, which is detrimental to the construction cause.
    There is also another policy, which is the policy of concentrating forces to guarantee key projects and implementing the method of phased construction in batches. This is a construction policy and method that is both more, faster, better, and more economical. By adopting such a policy and method, we can "win one battle and then attack the rest, defeating them one by one." When a batch of projects is completed and put into production on time or ahead of schedule, we can free up forces to assault another batch of projects, ensuring that this batch of projects is also completed on time or ahead of schedule. The matter does not stop there. Because the key projects that we prioritize in basic construction are crucial to ensuring the development of the entire national economy and are urgently needed for developing production and improving people's lives, the timely and early commissioning of these projects will provide more favorable conditions for the construction of the next batch of projects. If steel mills are completed ahead of schedule, they can provide more steel; if machinery factories are completed ahead of schedule, they can provide more equipment... In addition, the early completion of the previous batch of projects can free up more manpower, and as a result, the next batch of projects will be completed faster and better. Repeatedly in this way, our basic construction every month, every quarter, and every year will continue to complete plans ahead of schedule and exceed targets, forming a "step-by-step" and constantly rising great leap forward situation.
    Ensuring that our production and construction continue to rise steadily and continuously should become the guiding ideology for our planning. On the basis of opposing right-leaning ideas and boosting energy, we should first quickly complete those projects that can be completed with effort, and then continue to work hard to achieve greater results. Specifically, when arranging basic construction plans for the first quarter of next year, all departments and localities should concentrate their efforts to guarantee key projects. Do not stretch the battle line too long and use the forces in a dispersed and even manner, but should concentrate forces to ensure the construction projects that are of great importance to the development of production next year, quickly start a batch, and quickly complete a batch; in the following quarters, expand the scale of construction further according to the conditions. Arranging the plan in this way will not only quickly and steadily achieve practical results, but also continuously move forward and rise continuously. As a result, we can better achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Will the construction policy of concentrating forces to guarantee key projects hinder the construction of necessary non-key projects? At the beginning of this year, some people were worried that concentrating forces and guaranteeing key projects would squeeze out necessary non-key projects. At that time, we said: Delaying the construction of some secondary projects does not mean "not doing them at all," but only arranging them slightly later in terms of time, and once the conditions are in place, they will be launched immediately. The fact is indeed the case. The projects that were once delayed were basically launched again after the manpower and material resources of the key projects were fully guaranteed, and many of them have already been completed and put into production. This precisely shows that: Concentrating forces to guarantee the rapid completion of key projects will not only not hinder the construction of non-key necessary projects, but will also create reliable conditions for the construction of non-key projects.
    Of course, the guarantee of key projects cannot be understood narrowly. First of all, the so-called guarantee of key projects does not mean only guaranteeing large-scale enterprises. Modern large-scale enterprises are the backbone of China's industry, and all those included in the construction projects should be given priority guarantees; however, the construction of large-scale enterprises must be carried out simultaneously with the construction of medium-sized and small-sized enterprises. Since medium-sized and small-sized enterprises can achieve more, faster, and more economical results, we will build more necessary medium-sized and small-sized enterprises next year, especially medium-sized and small-sized projects in transportation, mining, power, petroleum, chemical, and non-ferrous metals. These projects are also the focus of construction and must be completed in batches and put into production as soon as possible. Secondly, guaranteeing key projects is not just guaranteeing the construction of heavy industry. Heavy industry must be given priority development, which is beyond doubt, and important heavy industrial construction projects should be guaranteed to be completed quickly; however, the construction of heavy industry and light industry must also be carried out simultaneously. Actively developing light industry can not only better meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and the growing needs of people's lives, but also provide more funds for heavy industry, further promoting the development of heavy industry. Again, when guaranteeing key projects, we should also take into account the urgently needed projects in urban construction, culture and education, and the construction of urgently needed workers' dormitories. In short, all projects that have been carefully investigated and proven to be necessary and possible to build after being included in the plan must be guaranteed to be completed, but in the specific arrangement, they cannot be launched all at once, but should distinguish between priority and urgency, in phases and batches, completing one batch before starting another. When arranging the phased construction plan in batches, we must follow the spirit of "the whole country is a chessboard," reasonably rank them according to their importance and urgency, and give priority to guaranteeing the national key projects and the annual key projects, while appropriately taking care of other projects. In this way, key projects can be completed on time or ahead of schedule, and the entire basic construction plan can also be completed ahead of schedule and exceed targets.
    In 1959, we adopted the policy of concentrating forces to guarantee key projects and achieved brilliant victories in basic construction. Next year, we must continue to implement this policy, continue to adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously promote technical innovation, and vigorously promote mass movements. This is the guarantee of continued great leap forward and victory on the basic construction front next year.

### 基本建设必须坚持集中力量保证重点的方针

    基本建设必须坚持集中力量保证重点的方针
    今年，全国基本建设部门根据党的集中力量、保证重点的建设方针，在年初将工程项目按轻重缓急进行了合理排队，在设计和施工中，普遍采取了以重点工程为中心，分期分批突击，干完一批再干一批的办法，结果收到了十分良好的效果。重点工程在人力、物力方面得到了充分保证，大批重要工程项目加快了建设速度，按时或提前建成投入了生产。工业生产因此及时得到了大批生力军，迅速扩大了生产能力，对提前和超额完成今年的国民经济计划，起了重大的作用。例如北京市由于执行了集中优势力量保证重点的方针，实行了分期分批打歼灭战的办法，炼焦化学厂、合成纤维厂等几十个重要工业项目和人民大会堂、北京车站等一批大型公共建筑，都提前建成了。在一个大型企业的建设中，集中力量干完一批项目，再干一批项目的方法，也收到很大效果。例如武钢，今年采取分批突击的办法，首先集中主要力量建设炼铁系统的工程，然后又集中优势力量建设炼钢工程，使二号高炉、一号平炉、二号平炉以及选矿、烧结、炼焦等十三项重大工程，都提前建成投入生产。由于重点工程按时或提前投入生产，为非重点工程的建设提供了更加有利的条件。大批非重点的必要的工程项目也迅速建设起来了。集中优势力量分期分批建设，还更好地保证了工程质量。建设速度快了，工程成本也跟着降低了。由此可见，集中力量、保证重点是一个既能多快又能好省的正确方针。
    集中力量保证重点的主要经验之一，是按季按月地抓投入生产的项目，在投入生产（或交付使用）日期规定以后，必须采取具体措施，按期完成，只能提前，不能推后。因为，基本建设的目的是为了迅速增加生产能力，按季按月抓投入生产项目，就可以保证重点中的重点。
    明年，基本建设战线上将是一个继续跃进的形势。在有些部门，明年的生产总值中依靠新建项目投入生产的比重增加了，这就是说明年基本建设的任务更重大了。怎样很好地完成明年的基本建设任务呢？根本的一环，仍然是要贯彻执行集中力量保证重点的建设方针。
    为了加速改变我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌，我们需要建设的工程确实很多，我们采取什么方针来加速建设呢？一种方针是一拥而上，齐头并进。实践证明这是欲速则不达。因为在一定的时间内，人力物力总有一定的限度，技术力量、建筑材料和设备供应，不可能在同一时间内满足一切方面的需要。如果采取这种办法，人力、材料、设备势必要分散使用，结果会使所有工程都把工期拖得很长，不能迅速发挥投资效果。这是一种无形的但是重大的浪费，对建设事业是不利的。
    还有另一种方针，这就是集中力量保证重点的方针，实行分期分批建设的方法。这是一个又多又快又好又省的建设的方针和方法。采取这样的方针和办法，就能“一战而胜，再及其余，各个击破”。一批工程及时或提前建成投入了生产，就可以腾出力量去突击另一批工程，保证这批工程也及时或提前建成。事情还不止于此。由于我们在基本建设中优先保证的重点，是对于保证整个国民经济的发展具有重大作用，而又是发展生产和改善人民生活所迫切需要的建设项目，这批工程及时和提前投入生产以后，就会为下一批工程的建设提供更为有利的条件。钢铁厂提前建成了，可以提供更多的钢材；机械厂提前建成了，可以提供更多的设备……再加上前一批工程提前建成，可以腾出更多的人力，结果下一批工程就会完成得更快更好。如此循环往复，我们每个月、每个季度、每个年度的基本建设，就会不断地提前和超额完成计划，而形成一个“步步高升”的不断上涨的跃进局面。
    保证我们的生产和建设持续地稳定地不断高涨，应该成为我们安排计划的指导思想。要在反右倾、鼓干劲的基础上，把那些经过努力可以完成的工程项目，先迅速完成，然后再继续努力，争取更大的成绩。具体说来，各部门、各地方在安排明年第一季度的基本建设计划时，要集中力量，保证重点。不要把战线拉得过长，把力量分散平均使用，而应该集中力量保证对于明年发展生产有重大关系的工程项目，迅速开工一批，迅速建成一批；在以后的季度，再根据条件，进一步扩大建设规模。这样来安排计划，既能迅速地稳收实效，又能不断前进，不断高涨，结果就能更好地实现多快好省的要求。
    集中力量保证重点的建设方针，会不会妨害必要的非重点项目的建设呢？今年年初，就有人曾经担心过：集中力量、保证重点，会挤掉必要的非重点项目。那时候我们就说：推迟一些次要工程的建设，并非根本“不为”，只是在时间上要安排得稍晚一些，条件一旦具备，便会立刻上马。事实果然如此，原来一度推迟的工程，后来在重点工程的人力物力得到充分保证以后，基本上都又上了马，其中有许多早已建成投入了生产。这恰恰说明了：集中力量保证重点工程迅速建成，不仅不会妨碍非重点的必要的项目的建设，而且会给非重点工程的建设创造可靠的条件。
    当然，对保证重点不能作狭隘的了解。首先，所谓保证重点工程，并不等于只保证大型企业。现代化的大型企业是我国工业的骨干，凡是列入建设项目的都应该优先保证；但是，大型企业必须和中小型企业的建设同时并举。由于中小型企业既能多快，又能好省，明年我们还要更多地建设必要的中小型企业，特别是交通运输、采掘、电力、石油、化工、有色金属等方面的中小型工程。这些工程同样是建设的重点，必需分批建成，及早投入生产。其次，保证重点，也不是仅仅保证重工业的建设。重工业必须优先发展，这是毫无疑问的，重要的重工业建设项目应该保证迅速建成；但是，重工业和轻工业的建设也必须同时并举。积极发展轻工业，既可以更好地供应工农业生产的需要和人民生活日益增长的需要，又可以为重工业提供更多的资金，进一步促进重工业的发展。再次，在保证重点的时候，也应当照顾到像城市建设、文化教育等方面急需的工程项目和急需的职工宿舍的建设。总之，凡是经过认真考察，证明确是必需而又有可能兴建的项目被列入计划以后，就都要保证完成，但在具体安排时，又不能一拥而上，而应当分清先后缓急，分期分批，干完一批，再干一批。在安排分期分批的建设计划时，必须根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，按照轻重缓急合理排队，尽先保证全国的重点、全年的重点，适当照顾其他。这样，重点工程就能及时或提前建成，整个的基本建设计划也就能提前和超额完成。
    1959年，我们采取集中力量保证重点的方针，取得了基本建设的辉煌胜利。明年要继续贯彻执行这一方针，继续坚持政治挂帅，大搞技术革新，大搞群众运动，这是明年基本建设战线继续跃进的胜利保证。
