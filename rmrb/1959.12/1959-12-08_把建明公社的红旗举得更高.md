Raise the Red Flag of the Jianming Commune Even Higher

In many people's communes, there exists a section of poor teams. Helping these poor teams catch up with the rich teams is essential for realizing the continued leap forward in agricultural production and promoting the consolidation and development of the commune. Local newspapers have done a lot of work to encourage poor teams to catch up with rich teams and to introduce experiences in this regard. Recently, the Hebei Daily's publicity on learning from the Jianming Commune has been a relatively planned and in-depth report.

The Jianming Commune is a red flag of the people's communes in Hebei Province. It grew and strengthened on the basis of what was previously known as the "poor stick" cooperative. After developing from an advanced cooperative to a commune last year, the commune's agricultural production achieved another significant leap forward. This year, the commune's grain yield per mu is expected to continue to increase by nearly 13% compared to last year. Diversified operations are also becoming increasingly prosperous. Over the past few years, the lives of commune members have gone from poverty to prosperity: from eating bran and vegetables to selling surplus grain, from being in debt to saving money. The three donkey legs of the past have now turned into herds of mules and horses, pens full of cattle and sheep, and even tractors and cars...

In its publicity on how to run the communes in the province better and encourage the poor teams to catch up with the rich teams, the Hebei Daily raised this red flag high, consciously setting up a benchmark throughout the province. In mid-October, the newspaper successively reported on the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee holding an on-site meeting to summarize the experience of carrying out the movement to learn from and catch up with the Jianming Commune, as well as the upsurge of learning further stirred up by the communes in Tangshan. The newspaper published an editorial praising Tangshan's approach, pointing out that it was also necessary for other regions to do so. The editorial fully estimated the significance of carrying out the movement to learn from the Jianming Commune, believing that it was actually a political movement against right-leaning tendencies and to encourage effort. Carrying out this movement is essential to achieving the provincial party committee's call to "work hard for three to five years to fundamentally change the face of agricultural production in our province."

After this, the newspaper published the Hebei Provincial Party Committee's "Decision on Carrying Out the Experience of Learning from the Jianming People's Commune and Running the People's Communes in the Province Better," reporting on the enthusiastic response of the vast number of commune and team cadres and commune members to the provincial party committee's call, establishing ambitious goals.

In the process of carrying out the movement to learn from the Jianming Commune, the newspaper paid close attention to solving ideological problems and learning methods. For example, some communes and teams with poor conditions felt that they were too far behind the Jianming Commune and could not catch up; some communes and teams with good conditions believed that their production level was already not low and there was nothing to learn. In an editorial entitled "What to Learn? How to Learn?" the newspaper, on the one hand, criticized various "pessimistic theories," and on the other hand, pointed out that learning from and catching up with the Jianming Commune was not simply learning from and catching up with the production level, but learning from the revolutionary spirit of the Jianming Commune, such as always listening to the Party, adhering to the socialist direction, relying on collective strength to quickly change the face of "poverty and blankness," the ambitious goal; the spirit of continuous revolution of never being complacent and forging ahead; the noble character of consistently adhering to the principle of diligence and thrift in running the commune... All of these should be learned not only by poor communes and poor teams, but also by rich communes and rich teams.

After establishing a benchmark and explaining some ideological issues of learning, the most important question is how to learn? The Hebei Daily continued to promote the learning movement by setting up benchmarks and explaining ideas. The newspaper reported that in the movement to learn from the Jianming Commune, Jiahe County, based on its own county's situation, firmly grasped the leadership of the poor teams, and in less than a year, two-thirds of the poor teams caught up with the rich teams. This fact not only shows that the face of the poor teams can be quickly changed, but also shows that the leadership must grasp the main links in the movement. The newspaper also reported that the Chengguan Commune in Xinle County, which has better production conditions, after overcoming complacency, formulated an advanced plan to catch up with the Jianming Commune and launched a "hand-in-hand competition" with another commune, the Handai Commune, to support each other and leap forward together. The newspaper gave high praise to this spirit of communist collaboration. This competition method has now been promoted.

The Hebei Daily's publicity on this learning movement is not only limited to the issue of poor teams catching up with rich teams. It is also good at combining with current work, as well as proposing that in all work, we should learn from the Jianming Commune's spirit of overcoming difficulties and the spirit of running the commune diligently and thriftily. For example, the newspaper reported that many communes in Shulu County encountered difficulties in the construction of water conservancy projects due to insufficient materials. Later, they learned from the Jianming Commune's spirit of relying on the masses for self-reliance and quickly found a solution, and the difficult problem was easily solved. This report closely linked learning from the Jianming Commune with promoting the current water conservancy construction. Recently, the newspaper published news about the Jianming Commune striving to achieve agricultural modernization as soon as possible. They are not waiting for machines, but actively creating conditions for mechanization, such as carrying out large-scale water conservancy projects and leveling land to prepare for the use of mechanized farming and irrigation; vigorously developing diversified operations to prepare funds for the purchase of machines. The newspaper pointed out that the Jianming Commune's proactive approach to creating conditions for the realization of agricultural modernization is worth learning by all communes and production teams.

In the movement to learn from the Jianming Commune, the Hebei Daily has so far published six editorials. These editorials elaborated on the significance of learning from the Jianming Commune, answered the questions of what to learn and how to learn, and, combined with typical reports, discussed issues such as helping poor teams catch up with rich teams, promoting the spirit of communist collaboration, and building water conservancy projects through self-reliance. Obviously, these many editorials have played a significant guiding role in the development of the movement.

### 把建明公社的红旗举得更高

    把建明公社的红旗举得更高
    很多人民公社中都存在着一部分穷队。帮助这些穷队赶上富队，这对于实现农业生产的继续跃进和促进公社的巩固和发展都是必需的。鼓舞穷队赶上富队，介绍这方面的经验，各地报纸都作了不少工作。最近河北日报关于学习建明公社的宣传，就是一次比较有计划和比较深入的报道。
    建明公社是河北省人民公社的一面红旗。它是在过去被人称为“穷棒子”社的基础上成长壮大起来的。去年由高级社发展为公社以后，这个社的农业生产又获得很大的跃进。今年这个社的粮食亩产量，预计将比去年继续增长近13％。多种经营也日益繁荣兴旺。几年来社员的生活由贫困走向富裕：他们从吃糠咽菜到出卖余粮，从欠债到储蓄。昔日的三条驴腿今天已变为骡马成群、牛羊满圈，还有拖拉机、汽车……。
    河北日报在宣传如何把全省公社办得更好，和鼓舞穷队赶富队的整个报道中，高高举起了这面红旗，有意识地在全省范围内树立起标兵。10月中旬，报纸先后报道了唐山市委召开现场会议总结开展学赶建明公社运动的经验，以及唐山市各公社鼓起干劲进一步掀起学习热潮。报纸发表社论赞扬了唐山市的作法，指出其他地区也有必要这样做。社论充分估计了开展学习建明公社运动的意义，认为这实际上是一次反右倾、鼓干劲的政治运动。开展这个运动，对于实现省委所号召的“苦战三、五年，根本改变我省农业生产面貌”是十分必要的。
    这以后，报纸发表了河北省委“关于开展学习建明人民公社的经验，把全省人民公社办得更好的决定”，报道了各地广大社、队干部和社员群众热烈响应省委号召，树立雄心大志的情况。
    报纸在开展学习建明公社运动的过程中，很注意解决思想问题和学习方法问题。如有些条件差的社、队，觉得被建明社丢得太远，没法赶上；有些条件好的社、队，认为自己的生产水平已经不低，没有什么可学的。报纸在题为“学什么？怎样学？”的社论中，一方面批判了各种“悲观论”，另一方面指出了学赶建明社不是单纯从生产水平上去学赶，而是要学赶建明社的革命精神，如永远听党的话，坚持社会主义方向；依靠集体力量迅速改变“一穷二白”面貌的雄心大志；永不自满、勇往直前的不断革命精神；始终一贯地坚持勤俭办社原则的高尚品德……所有这些，不仅穷社穷队应当学习，就是富社富队也应学习。
    树立了标兵，解释了学习的一些思想问题以后，最重要的问题就是怎样学习呢？河北日报继续以树标兵、解释思想的办法来推动学习运动。报纸报道了交河县在开展学习建明公社的运动中，根据本县情况，狠狠抓住了对穷队的领导，在不到一年的时间内就有三分之二的穷队赶上富队的情况。这个事实不仅说明了穷队的面貌是可以迅速改变的，而且说明了在运动中领导方面必须抓住主要环节。报纸还报道了生产条件较好的新乐县城关公社在克服自满情绪后，订出了追赶建明社的先进计划，并同另一个公社——邯邰社展开了互相支援、共同跃进的“携手赛”。报纸对这种共产主义协作精神给予了崇高的评价。现在这种竞赛方式已得到推广。
    河北日报宣传这次学习运动，不仅仅停留在穷队赶富队的问题上。它还善于结合当前工作，以及提出在各项工作中都应该学习建明社克服困难的精神和勤俭办社的精神。例如报纸报道束鹿县的许多公社在水利建设中发生物料不足的困难，后来学习了建明公社依靠群众自力更生的精神，很快找到了办法，困难问题迎刃而解。这个报道把学习建明社同推动当前的水利建设紧密地结合在一起。最近报纸发表了建明公社争取早日实现农业现代化的消息。他们不是等待机器，而是积极地为机械化创造条件，例如大搞水利、平整土地，为使用机械耕作和浇水作准备；大力发展多种经营，为购置机器准备资金。报纸指出，建明公社这种积极主动为实现农业现代化创造条件的做法，值得所有的公社和生产队学习。
    在学习建明公社的运动中，河北日报迄今已发表了六篇社论。这些社论阐述了学习建明社的意义，解答了学什么、怎样学的问题，并结合典型报道论述了帮助穷队赶上富队、发扬共产主义协作精神、自力更生办水利等问题。显然，这许多社论对于运动的开展起了很大的指导作用。
