　　On the brilliant road of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line, a powerful contingent is advancing vigorously. When I realized that I was a member of this contingent, I felt so happy and proud. Looking back on the path I have traveled over the years, I have many feelings and experiences. Since I practiced the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, going deep into the lives and struggles of the workers, my thoughts and feelings have indeed undergone great changes. I came from an intellectual background, and I was tainted with some bourgeois ideas. Going deep into the workers' struggle and the successive rectification studies have given me profound and unforgettable training.

　　Recalling the beginning of 1946, when I first combined with the liberated worker masses to help the workers with wall newspapers at the Longyan Iron Smelting Plant, I lacked a common language with the workers. Although I rationally wanted to integrate with them, my thoughts and feelings were somewhat incompatible. During that period, I couldn't write any works at all. However, after arriving in Harbin that summer, the situation gradually changed. The Northeast was a new area, and we had to mobilize the masses to make the Northeast a major rear area to support the national liberation war. The work was arduous and complex. At that time, every party member and every revolutionary cadre had to do the work of two or three people. I was sent to take over the post office and establish a postal trade union to carry out liquidation struggles and welfare undertakings. To be honest, I didn't know how to do these things. I had to rely on the Party and the worker masses. Under such circumstances, I naturally discussed with the worker masses, both leading them and asking for their advice, sharing weal and woe with them. After that, I not only had a common language with them, but also gained some understanding of their thoughts and feelings. Only then did I begin to understand the meaning of Chairman Mao's saying that writers should devote themselves to the fiery struggle to transform themselves. Later, the Party asked me to go to the Jingpo Lake Hydropower Station. On the third day of the liberation of Shenyang, the Party asked me to go to the Huanggu Tun Railway Factory to do mass work. Under the close guidance of the Party, I led the workers of this factory from registering reactionary party groups, speaking out bitterness, establishing trade unions to building the Party and the Communist Youth League, and launching production emulation campaigns... This stage really greatly trained me. In these three or four years, I not only learned to do mass work, but also learned the advanced qualities and collectivist spirit of the working class. Old Sun's selfless labor at the hydropower station and the quality of attributing credit and honor to everyone deeply educated me. Song Guangfu of the railway factory took the lead in doing voluntary labor and adding to the "Beiping" locomotive, but he did not allow reporters to praise his advanced behavior, which also enlightened me. I gradually changed the intellectual's faults of personal prominence and bragging about myself. Their heroic sense of being the masters of the country, their selfless labor, their creativity in technical innovation, their dedication to the industrialization of the motherland, and their optimistic spirit all excited and inspired me at all times. In those years, I felt that if I didn't write about them, I would simply be letting them down. So I successively wrote "Prime Mover" and "Locomotive." Although those two books were a bit rough, they were very different from what I had written before, both in content and form. They reflected the enthusiasm of the working class in building the motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party. This was because I listened to Chairman Mao's words, listened to the Party organization, combined with the masses, and my thinking was improved. However, after 1950, I developed some complacency. I forgot the long-term and arduous nature of ideological transformation that Chairman Mao said; coupled with my ignorance of the theory of continuous revolution, I thought that my ideological transformation was almost complete. From 1951 to 1953, I left the fiery struggle of the masses and settled down in a comfortable office. During this period, I couldn't write anything decent. In 1954, I once again devoted myself to the fiery struggle of the workers, working in Anshan, China's steel city, and I have continued to write some works to this day.

　　Judging from my own ideological transformation and creative achievements, they are exactly proportional. It is not inversely proportional as the bourgeois writers say. Bourgeois writers advocate the theory that world outlook has nothing to do with writers, as if the more contradictory the world outlook and creative methods are, the greater the work is. They love to cite Tolstoy and Balzac as examples. However, the times in which Tolstoy and Balzac lived were completely different from our modern writers. Socialist writers are armed with Marxism-Leninism and can clearly understand society and see the direction of history. In fact, those bourgeois writers may not be very interested in Tolstoy and Balzac, but they just use these two great writers as a guise to lure us away from the Marxist-Leninist world outlook. If we had a bourgeois world outlook, they would applaud and welcome us. Chinese writers, especially Communist Party writers, can only listen to Chairman Mao's words and honestly make a thorough transformation of their non-proletarian world outlook, otherwise, the "petty-bourgeois kingdom in the depths of the soul" may reveal its flaws at any time. We must use practical actions to shatter the arguments of bourgeois writers.

　　Speaking of going deep into life, I think it is best to participate in some practical work. This has the following advantages.

　　First, due to the needs of work, I need to study the Party's policies more, and the Party's guidelines and policies at each period make my mind clearer, avoid making mistakes, and also improve my ability to recognize the essence of things. I have realized that the Party always teaches us to follow the mass line, organize and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the worker masses - the subjective initiative of the masses. In fact, only the department that fully develops the enthusiasm of the masses can see its production flourish. We who do Party work can only implement the Party's line and rely on the masses to complete the production tasks. It is because of these years of training that I have developed a good habit of being happy to see the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses. Second, from work, I deeply realize that the Party's policies come from the masses and go to the masses. The Party always listens to the voices and wishes of the masses, concentrates and raises their wishes, and then formulates guidelines and plans. Therefore, the plan has a realistic basis and also has great inspiring and romantic spirit. Every year when I discuss the plan with the masses, the masses warmly welcome it. But there are always a few conservatives or bureaucrats who are not very welcome. However, their conservatism is always overcome under the education of the Party and the struggle of the masses. Every year I receive such training, I realize more deeply the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the masses, and realize that our working people are invincible under the wise leadership of the Communist Party. So I feel that I can't describe well enough or fully enough to use all my enthusiasm to praise this phenomenon. But some people can't see the light, but they are looking for "darkness" all day long. I think that if a writer really understands the past suffering of the workers and peasants, and sincerely realizes the joy and soaring energy of their being masters of the house after liberation, they will join the masses to praise and defend this society. What we see every day are people like Lao Mengtai, Chen Xiaofa, and Li Shaokui. Lao Mengtai is an old worker with more than 40 years of work experience. During the occupation period, he hated the Japanese devils. In the new society, he loved the factory as his home. During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, when American planes were overhead, he worked day and night with tools in his hand, preparing to coexist with the blast furnace; he picked up every scrap of iron wire and accumulated a "Mengtai warehouse"; he led everyone to use waste parts and substitutes to repair the blast furnace and equipment, saving countless funds for the country. Bourgeois writers believe that there are no heroes in the world without shortcomings. But in my many years of contact with Lao Mengtai, I really didn't find any shortcomings in him. If he has any shortcomings, it can only be said that he has not yet written an article scolding bourgeois writers. However, his low level of culture is not the ironclad proof that the old world protected by bourgeois writers cruelly treated Mengtai? Chen Xiaofa and Li Shaokui were both steel workers who fled from famine in Shandong and Hebei to Anshan before liberation. In the old society, they suffered all kinds of hardships. In the new society, they have been selected as models for many years. The certificates of merit are full on the wall. Now one is a local expert in furnace making and the other is a steelmaking expert. On June 23 this year, the two of them stepped forward to rescue the oxygen pipe explosion accident, so that the factory did not suffer any losses, and the workers were turned from danger to safety. Aren't they our heroes? If we talk about humanitarianism, these figures like Xiang Xiuli are the greatest humanitarians, the proletarian revolutionary humanitarians.

　　The third advantage of participating in practical work is that it can cultivate political sensitivity. Because of doing practical work and dealing with specific problems, we must better study the Party's policies. The Party's policies are the soul of the era in our society. Firmly implementing the Party's policies, we can be closely related to the pulse of the times, and we may be able to better serve the current politics when we create. Bourgeois writers believe that literature and art cannot cooperate with political movements. That is their lie. "The drunkard's intention is not in the wine," but to make our literature and art leave politics. But indeed some kind people think that works do not necessarily closely cooperate with political movements. I also had this mechanical idea, thinking that short stories, features, and poems can cooperate, but long works are difficult. But the fact is not entirely like this. If a writer is familiar with life, is good at exploring the regularity of life development, is good at discovering things in the budding state, especially studies the Party's policies at all times, and has these few points, then what he writes must conform to the spirit of the times and have a promoting effect on reality. For example, a writer who is familiar with rural areas and peasants, if he understands the peasants' urgent desire to change the poor and white appearance and the desire to move from small collectives to large collectives and to the system of ownership by the whole people before 1958; and the writer studies the Party's guidelines and policies that guide the peasants to move forward at all times; then, even if the organizational form of the commune has appeared when this book is published, and although there is no such name and details as the commune in that book, the ideological content still fits the spirit of the times and plays a role in educating and inspiring people. However, I am not advocating that writing things must cooperate with the current political movement. However, literary and artistic works should consider the important issue of serving the current politics. And closely cooperating with the current political movement is not mysterious or impossible. I have had attempts in this regard. I have lived in Anshan for several years, and I intentionally want to see the development process of this large enterprise. I spent three years there to simply find out some of the laws of iron and steel joint enterprises. It took so long, of course, because the production is complex, but the problem is not in the complexity, but in the fact that it is a very typical place. - This place is the best example of how our Party can excellently lead large enterprises by transforming and expanding an enterprise that was originally operated by Japanese invaders and was plundering and backward by seven or eight times, making it a completely socialist, world-leading advanced iron and steel joint enterprise. This place is a great melting pot for tempering people's socialist thinking. This place also prominently embodies the noble internationalist spirit of the Soviet Union in helping the Chinese people. I need to carefully observe it and study it.

　　In the spring of 1957, based on my own experience, I conceived a novel story. I wanted to write about the small leap forward in 1956, the workers' enthusiasm for production during that period, the struggle between workers and right-leaning conservatives, and the struggle between Party leading cadres, workers, and representatives of the bourgeois line. But as soon as I started writing, the anti-Rightist struggle unfolded across the country. This greatly inspired me, and I realized such a problem: To thoroughly mobilize the masses and oppose right-leaning conservatism, we must adhere to the Party's industrial construction line and launch a struggle against the bourgeois line. So, after supplementation, the theme of the novel became clearer. Soon, under the glorious illumination of the general line, a large-scale mass movement that made people happy and excited developed vigorously. The steel capital welcomed the spring. At that time, I was so excited that I couldn't completely write calmly according to the original story. Writing a small leap forward in the era of the Great Leap Forward is so discouraging! It took more than five years to write a small leap forward, so do I have to wait a few more years to observe this Great Leap Forward before writing it? No, I want to revise the plan and write about rectification and the Great Leap Forward. Anyway, I originally had a sub-line of opposing the bourgeois line. If I add and revise it, it will not only not harm the original main characters and themes, but only make them stronger, but I just need to add details and change some plots. At that time, a friend advised me not to force myself to cooperate, and of course he didn't understand my grasp of the observation and understanding of reality. But I recall that the Party's successive instructions in recent years have pointed out the direction of development here; the development of each historical stage here is clearly displayed. Is there anything I can't see clearly? What else is there to hesitate about? So I revised the plan while writing. Writing about the vigorous large-scale mass movement is so energetic, writing about how the Party's general line is warmly supported by the broad masses is so happy! That's how I wrote "Riding the Wind and Waves".

　　Twelve years ago, when I first saw the liberated industrial workers actively and selflessly repairing their factories on the ruins, I couldn't wait to shape the image of Lao Sun. This time, when I saw the magnificent battle picture of the steel workers enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to strive for the top, I couldn't help but immediately want to praise them. Yes, fast, it is inevitable that there will be rough or insufficiently mature shortcomings. But we can't always wait. New topics and new artistic images do not mature in waiting, but gradually become perfect in our hard work and repeated practice. So we don't have to worry, we don't have to wait. Since rectification and the Great Leap Forward have come, let our pens rush to meet them quickly. Seeing the victory of the Party's general line, seeing the complete victory of the Party's leadership of large enterprises, how can I not be eager to write it out? The Party organization's many years of education to me, the working people's many years of education to me, are deeply unforgettable, and my class sense of responsibility urges me to be eager to write these out!

　　The fourth advantage of going down to work is that the mass struggle life is rich and colorful, and the materials are endless. Chairman Mao said that the mass life is the source of creation. There are heroes and major themes, and they are presented to us in large quantities every day. What we see are the workers and cadres who are rescuing the machine in the rain, and what we think of are the peasants who repaired the dam overnight in winter and have now successfully blocked the flood. Xiang Xiuli, Chen Xiaofa, Dong Cunrui, Lao Mengtai, etc. are all heroes with deep class feelings. Bourgeois writers prefer to say that the permanent themes are "humanity" and "love." What they advocate is the bourgeois "humanity" and "love." And what we advocate is to write class struggle from the perspective of the proletariat; to write about the development process of the working people changing their own faces while transforming society; to write about the struggle between the advanced and the backward; to write about the working people's struggle with nature for the happiness of millions of people. Such a theme is not only of practical significance, but also of permanent significance.

　　Let us hold high the banner of Comrade Mao Zedong and continue to forge ahead courageously on the broad road!

　　深入群众生活的点滴体会
　　草明
    在毛泽东文艺路线这条光辉的大道上，一支强大的队伍浩浩荡荡地前进着。当我意识到自己是这支队伍中的一员的时候，心情是多么愉快和自豪。回想起自己这些年来所走过的路，有许多感想和体会。我自从实践了毛主席所指示的方向，深入工人的生活和斗争以后，思想感情的确起了很大的变化。我是个知识分子出身的人，身上沾染了一些资产阶级的思想。深入工人斗争和历次的整风学习，都给了我深刻难忘的锻炼。
    回想起1946年初，我第一次和解放了的工人群众结合，到龙烟炼铁厂去帮助工人搞墙报，那时我和工人们缺少共同的语言，虽然理性上很想和他们打成一片，但思想感情总有些格格不入。那个时期我根本写不出什么作品来。但是，同年夏天到了哈尔滨以后，情况逐渐改变了。东北是个新区，我们必须把群众发动起来，使东北成为支援全国解放战争的大后方。工作是艰巨而复杂的，那时不管哪一个党员，哪一个革命干部，都要一个顶俩，一个顶三。我被派去接收邮政局，建立邮政工会，要搞清算斗争，要搞福利事业。老实说，这些事情我都不会做，我只好一依靠党、二依靠工人群众。在这样的形势要求下，我就自然和工人群众在一起商量，既要领导他们，又要请教他们，和他们同甘共苦。这以后，我不仅和他们有了共同的语言，而且对他们的思想感情有了一些了解。我这才开始懂得毛主席说的作家应投身到火热的斗争中去改造自己的意义。后来党又叫我去镜泊湖水电站。沈阳解放第三天，党又叫我去皇姑屯铁路工厂做群众工作。在党的密切指导下，我就领着这个厂的工人们，从反动党团登记、诉苦运动、建立工会到建党、建团，开展生产竞赛运动……。这阶段真是大大地锻炼了我。这三、四年里头，我不仅学会做群众工作，而且也学习了工人阶级的先进品质和集体主义精神。水电站的老孙头的忘我劳动和把功劳、荣誉归功于大家的品质，深深地教育了我。铁路工厂宋广福带头作义务劳动，加修“北平号”机车，但不让记者表扬他的先进行为，也启发了我，我逐渐改掉了知识分子的个人突出、好夸耀自己的毛病，他们当了国家的主人翁的豪迈感，他们的忘我劳动，他们在技术革新方面的创造性，他们为祖国工业化献身的风格，他们的乐观的精神都时刻激动着我，鼓舞着我。在那些年月里，我觉得要是我不写他们，简直就是对不起他们，于是我相继写了“原动力”、“火车头”。那两本书虽然粗糙些，但不论在内容和形式上，比我以前写的东西都有很大的不同。它们反映了工人阶级在共产党领导下建设祖国的热情。这是由于我听了毛主席的话，听了党组织的话，和群众结合，思想有了改进的缘故。不过，1950年以后，我产生了一些自满情绪。忘了毛主席说的思想改造的长期性和艰苦性；加以我对不断革命论的无知，我以为自己思想改造的差不多了。1951—1953年间，我便离开了群众的火热的斗争，安于舒服的办公室，这时期也就写不出什么像样的东西。1954年我又重新投身到工人的火热斗争中去，在我国的钢铁城市鞍山工作，一直到现在，也继续写了些作品。
    从我自己的思想改造和创作成果来看，它们恰好成正比例。不是如资产阶级文艺家说的是反比例。资产阶级文艺家提倡世界观与作家无关论，好像世界观和创作方法越矛盾，作品就越伟大似的。他们爱引托尔斯泰、巴尔扎克为例。但是，托尔斯泰和巴尔扎克所处的时代与我们现代作家完全不同。社会主义的作家的头脑有马克思列宁主义的武装，可以很清楚地认识社会和看清历史的去向。其实，那些资产阶级文艺家未必对托尔斯泰和巴尔扎克有好多兴趣，只不过拿这两个大作家作幌子，诱骗我们离开马克思列宁主义的世界观罢了。要是我们是资产阶级的世界观，他们就会拍手欢迎。中国的作家，特别是共产党员作家，只有听毛主席的话，老老实实地使自己的非无产阶级的世界观来一番彻底改造，否则，“灵魂深处的小资产阶级的王国”说不定什么时候便露出马脚。我们要用实际行动来粉碎资产阶级文艺家的论调。
    讲到深入生活，我认为最好参加一些实际的工作，这样有下面几点好处。
    第一，由于工作需要，自己就更需要学习党的政策，每一时期党的方针政策的指示，使自己头脑比较清醒，不会犯错误，而且也提高了认识事物本质的能力。我体会到党无论什么时候都教导我们走群众路线，组织和发挥工人群众的积极性和创造性——群众的主观能动性。事实上，只有哪个部门充分发挥群众的积极性，哪个部门的生产才会蓬勃上升。我们做党的工作的人，也只有贯彻党的这一路线，依靠群众，才能完成生产任务。就是由于这多年的锻炼，我养成了一见群众的热劲和积极性就高兴的好习惯。第二，从工作中，深深体会党的政策是从群众中来，到群众中去的。党总是倾听群众的呼声和愿望，把他们的愿望集中和提高以后，制订了方针和计划。所以，计划既有现实的基础而又有很大的鼓舞性和浪漫主义精神。我每年和群众讨论计划时，群众都热烈欢迎。但是总有少数保守主义者或官僚主义者不太欢迎。然而他们的保守，总是在党的教育和群众的斗争下被克服的。我年年受这样的锻炼，更体会到党与群众的那种血肉的关系，体会到我们的劳动人民在英明的共产党的领导下，是无坚不克的。所以我觉得自己用所有的热情来讴歌这种现象都无法形容得好，形容得充分。但是有些人竟看不见光明，却成天在那儿找“黑暗”。我以为，一个作家要是真的了解工农群众过去的痛苦，又衷心体会了他们在解放后当家作主的那种喜悦和冲天的干劲的话，就会同群众一道来赞美这个社会，保卫这个社会的。我们成天看见的是老孟泰、陈效法、李绍奎这些人。老孟泰是个有四十多年工龄的老工人，在被占领时期仇恨日本鬼子。在新社会他爱厂如家，抗美援朝时美国飞机在头顶上，他不分日夜地手执工具，准备与高炉共存亡；他见一根废铁丝都拾起来，积存了一个“孟泰仓库”；他领着大家利用废件和代用品修好了高炉和设备，为国家节约了无数资金。资产阶级文艺家认为世界上不存在没有缺点的英雄。但在我与老孟泰的多年接触中，确实没有发现他有什么缺点。如果说他有缺点的话，只能说他还没有写文章骂过资产阶级文艺家。然而他的文化低，不正是资产阶级文艺家所保护的那个旧世界残酷地对待孟泰的铁证吗？陈效法、李绍奎都是解放前由山东、河北逃荒来到鞍山的炼钢工人。在旧社会里他们吃尽苦头，在新社会里他们连年被选为模范。奖状在墙上都挂满了。现在一个是炼炉的土专家，一个是炼钢的能手。今年6月23日，他俩挺身抢救了氧气管爆炸的事故，使工厂没有受任何损失，工人们得转危为安。难道他们不是我们的英雄？如果讲人道主义，这些向秀丽式的人物就是最伟大的人道主义者，无产阶级的革命人道主义者。
    参加实际工作的第三个好处，是可以培养政治敏感。由于做实际工作，要处理具体问题，就得更好地学习党的政策。党的政策就是我们社会里的时代的灵魂。坚决贯彻党的政策，自己就能和时代的脉搏息息相关，进行创作时就有可能更好地为当前政治服务。资产阶级文艺家是认为文艺不能配合政治运动的。那是他们的谎话。“醉翁之意不在酒”，而是想使我们的文艺离开政治。但也的确有些好心人认为作品不一定能紧密地配合政治运动。我也有过这种机械的想法，认为短篇、特写、诗可以配合，长大的作品就困难。但事实并不完全都这样，一个作家要是熟悉生活，善于探索生活发展的规律性，善于发现萌芽状态的事物，特别是时刻研究党的政策，具备这几条，则他写出来的东西，一定能符合时代的精神，对现实有推动的作用。例如一个熟悉农村和农民的作家，1958年前写个长的作品，要是他体会了农民那种迫切要求改变一穷二白的面貌，渴望早点从小集体走向大集体、到全民所有制的愿望；而作家又时刻研究党指引农民向前迈进的方针政策；那么，即使这本书出版时公社组织形式已出现，而那书里虽然没有公社这种名称和细节，但思想内容仍然配合得上时代的精神和起教育鼓舞人的作用的。不过，我倒并不是主张写东西非要配合当前政治运动。但是，文艺作品应该考虑到为当前政治服务这个重要的课题的。而且紧密地配合当前政治运动也不是神秘的或不可能的。我在这方面就有过尝试。我在鞍钢生活了好几年，有意要看看这个大企业的发展的过程。我在那儿花三年时间才简单地摸到钢铁联合企业的一些规律性。需要那么长的时间，固然因为生产复杂，但问题还不在于复杂，而在于那儿是个很有典型意义的地方。——这地方是我们党把原是日本侵略者经营的掠夺性的落后的企业，改建扩建成七、八倍大，成为完全是社会主义性质的、世界有数的先进的钢铁联合企业，这地方，是党能够卓越地领导大型企业的一个最好的范例。这地方，是锻炼人们的社会主义思想的大熔炉。这地方，也突出地体现了苏联帮助中国人民的高贵的国际主义精神。我须要仔细地观察它、研究它。
    1957年春天，我凭自己体验所得，构思了一个长篇小说故事。想写1956年的那个小跃进，写那时期工人的生产干劲，写工人与右倾保守作斗争，党领导干部、工人与资产阶级路线的代表人物作斗争。但刚一动手写，全国展开了反右斗争。这大大启发了我，我领悟到这样的一个问题：要彻底发动群众，反掉右倾保守，就必须坚持党的工业建设路线，与资产阶级的路线展开斗争。于是，经过补充，长篇的主题更明确了。不久，总路线光辉照耀下出现了大跃进，使人心花怒放的大规模的群众运动蓬勃展开了。钢都迎接了春天。那时我兴奋得不能完全按原来的故事平静地写下去。在大跃进的年代里写了个小跃进，多泄气！花了五年多工夫才写个小跃进，那么，这个大跃进难道又要等观察几年以后再写？不，我要修改计划，把整风、大跃进都写进去。反正我原来就有反对资产阶级路线这条副线的。我要是加以补充和修改，对原来的主要人物、主题不仅无损，而只有更强烈些，只是要补充细节、改动一些情节罢了。当时有朋友劝我不必勉强配合，他当然不明白我对现实观察认识的把握。但是我回想几年来党的历次指示已指明了这儿的发展的方向；这儿的各个历史阶段发展到这儿已是明明白白地摆着的了。我难道还有什么看不清的吗？还有什么好犹豫的呢？于是我一面修改计划，一面写下去。写轰轰烈烈的大规模的群众运动，多带劲啊，写党的总路线受到广大群众热烈拥护时，有多痛快啊！我就是这样写了“乘风破浪”。
    十二年前，我第一次看见解放了的产业工人在废墟上积极忘我地修复了自己的工厂的动人景象时，我迫不及待地塑造了老孙头的形象。这次，看见钢铁工人热烈地响应党中央和毛主席的多、快、好、省，力争上游的号召时那个宏伟的战斗图景，我禁不住立即要讴歌他们。是的，快，就难免有粗糙，或考虑不够成熟的缺点。但是我们不能老等待。新的课题、新的艺术形象，并不是在等待中就能成熟的，而是在我们辛勤的劳动与反复的实践中逐渐完美起来的。所以我们不必顾虑，不必等待。整风大跃进既然来到了，我们的笔就赶快迎上去吧。看见党的总路线的胜利，看见党领导大型企业的彻底胜利，我怎能不急于把它写出来？党组织对我的多年教育，劳动人民对我的多年教育，都使我深刻难忘，我的阶级责任心促使我不能不急于把这些写出来！
    下去做工作的第四个好处是群众斗争生活丰富多彩，材料是写不完的，毛主席说的群众生活是创作的源泉这话千真万确。英雄人物、重大题材有的是，每天大量呈现在我们眼前。我们看到的是在雨中抢救机器的工人和干部，想到的是冬天连夜修坝、如今已胜利地拦住了洪水的农民。向秀丽、陈效法、董存瑞、老孟泰等都是具有深厚阶级感情的英雄。资产阶级文艺家偏爱说什么永久性的主题是“人性”和“爱”。他们主张的是资产阶级的“人性”和“爱”。而我们主张的是用无产阶级的观点去写阶级斗争；写劳动人民在改造社会的同时改变自己的面貌这个发展的过程；写先进和落后的斗争；写劳动人民为千万人的幸福与自然所作的斗争。这样的主题，既具有现实意义，也有永久性的意义。
    让我们高举起毛泽东同志的旗帜，在康庄大道上继续奋勇前进吧！
