People's Communes Greatly Liberated Productive Forces
    --Investigation of Changjiang People's Commune Accelerating Agricultural Mechanization
    Dou Tianyu, Jiang Xian'gui, Jiang Weicai, Ren Ronghua, Shi Zhaoxiang

The Changjiang People's Commune in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, has demonstrated in its first year that the commune has a greater advantage than agricultural production cooperatives in accelerating agricultural mechanization. The commune members said: "The People's Commune has given us wings!"

    Sunset Glow and River Water Accompanied by Machine Hum

The Changjiang Commune has 8,904 households, 36,157 people, and 85,413 mu of land. It was formed by merging sixteen advanced cooperatives. Before liberation, this was a famous "big water tank" and "poor den." On average, there was a dike break and flooding once every three years and two instances of internal waterlogging. There was a lot of land and little labor, and there was no time to cultivate it. Thirty percent of the ten mu was barren and the wheat grew only "as tall as a toad raising its hand." From liberation to the establishment of elementary cooperatives, the production conditions and economic life here have changed a lot, but each laborer still had to bear more than nine mu of land, and internal waterlogging disasters were still quite serious. People demanded a rapid change in this situation and strongly yearned for the realization of agricultural mechanization. The commune members often said: "The day we can use 'iron dragons' to draw water and 'iron oxen' to plow the fields, we'd be happy drinking cold water for three days straight!" After the establishment of advanced cooperatives, the state handed over six tractors to the larger Changjiang Advanced Cooperative for use, and some advanced cooperatives also bought water pumps. However, due to the small scope of the agricultural cooperatives, weak strength, and other limitations, the pace of agricultural mechanization was relatively slow. The sixteen cooperatives had only 1,400 mu of machine-irrigated area, and the machine-cultivated area was only more than 3,900 mu. After the birth of the People's Commune, the members' requirements were realized. Over the past year, agricultural mechanization has been advancing like a roc spreading its giant wings into the sky, advancing a thousand miles a day. The total machine-irrigated area of the commune has expanded thirty-four times compared with the advanced cooperative era, and 80% of the farmland has achieved mechanical irrigation. In the autumn cultivation of 1959, more than half of the 38,500 mu of dry land was tilled using tractors. Now, the entire commune has twelve tractors, fifty-five water pumps, one large automatic thresher, two harvesters, ten seeders, fifteen various machine plows and machine harrows, as well as a motorized sailboat and six motorized trailers. As soon as people step into this commune, they can see a moving "mechanical farming map": when the bright morning glow has just dyed the river surface red, the roaring of motors is heard on this plain crisscrossed with waterways and fields. At more than twenty mechanical pumping stations, water pumps spew silver dragon-like columns of water, drawing the tamed river water into the fields. Tractors pull shiny five-铧 plows and nine-铧 plows, turning over large chunks of black oily fertile soil. On the threshing floor, the automatic threshing machine devours piles of rice bundles like small mountains at a rate of 2,500 jin per hour...

    Adding New Saddles, Buying Strong Horses

The People's Commune has accomplished in a short period of time what the advanced cooperatives could not accomplish in several years. This is primarily because the commune has expanded public accumulation, providing a large amount of funds for agricultural mechanization construction that the advanced cooperatives could not provide.

From the autumn of 1956 to the summer of 1958, the sixteen advanced cooperatives accumulated a total of 384,000 yuan, averaging 12,000 yuan per cooperative per year. More than ten thousand yuan is not a small amount, but it would be difficult to buy large agricultural machinery. The members of the Tianjie Advanced Cooperative had wanted to buy a water pump since 1955, but they never had the money to buy it. The Huayuan Advanced Cooperative bought a water pump, but never had the money to buy a water pump, "having money to buy a horse but no strength to buy a saddle". What can be done? Besides using this machine to process rice after the rice harvest, it could not be fully utilized for the rest of the time. The better situation was just the Changjiang Agricultural Cooperative. This cooperative was larger and had more accumulation. After the state handed over six tractors to them in 1956, the cooperative also added a thresher, two harvesters, and a water pump. The remaining fifteen advanced cooperatives only had eleven cooperatives which added nine water pumps.

After the establishment of the commune, the scale of the organization was expanded, the enthusiasm of the masses was fully mobilized, and production leaped onto the "Thousand-Li Horse." In the past year, the total income of the entire commune increased by 24.4% compared with the previous year, and the accumulated funds reached 637,622 yuan. With a solid material foundation, agricultural mechanization spread its wings. The teams that had machines added to their brilliance, and the teams that didn't have machines also went from scratch. The four brigades, which had been waiting for the "iron dragon" for several years but had not received it, happily carried back seven water pumps. The Tianjie Brigade accumulated more than 35,000 yuan in one year and immediately took out 9,000 yuan to buy a water pump and allocated 6,000 yuan to prepare to add another one. The Liuzhuang Production Team has high terrain. Before liberation, when there was a severe drought and water shortage, it cost five jiao to buy water to irrigate one mu of land. During the advanced cooperative era, the water conservancy conditions changed, but it was still necessary to set up three waterwheels to draw water day and night. This year, with the machine, more than 200 mu of rice were all mechanically irrigated.

The commune also took 149,500 yuan from the public accumulation extracted from the production brigades and the profits of commune-run enterprises to purchase six tractors, two water pumps, a motorized sailboat, four motorized trailers, and a portion of large-scale farming machinery, comprehensively enhancing mechanical power in all aspects such as cultivation, drainage and irrigation, transportation, and processing. The commune members deeply realized that collectivization is the main guarantee for accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization.

    Untying "Knots", "Iron Dragon" Displays Divine Power

The People's Commune overcame the limitations of the small collectives of advanced cooperatives and expanded the scope of activities, so that the potential of agricultural machinery was also greatly developed. Now, the utilization efficiency of one water pump is equal to that of five or six in the past; one tractor does the work in one year that it did in the past three or five years.

It's really a strange thing. During the advanced cooperative era, on the one hand, there were few machines and everyone wanted to buy them but couldn't afford them; on the other hand, many existing machines were "fishing for three days and drying the nets for two days." In the three years of establishing advanced cooperatives, each water pump was only used for 40 days a year on average. What was the reason for this?

One of the reasons is that the contradictions between the advanced cooperatives in water conservancy could not be resolved, the water system could not be planned uniformly, channels could not be dug in large quantities, water could not flow smoothly, and the water pump could not be used to its full potential. A concrete manifestation of this contradiction is the problem of interspersed fields between cooperatives. Like the Bai Zha and Sun Zhuang advanced cooperatives, which were merged into the current Binjiang Brigade, there were four or five hundred mu of fields interspersed together at that time. Both cooperatives had two water pumps and needed to dig channels. But who should dig it? If Sun Zhuang wants to dig, it has to dig into Bai Zha's fields. The people of Bai Zha said: "Digging our fields to irrigate your fields, there is no such cheap thing!" Sun Zhuang wanted to exchange fields, but there was another problem: their soil quality was worse, and Bai Zha's soil quality was better. Wouldn't it be a loss to exchange good for bad? No way! The matter of repairing the canal had to be abandoned. In three years, the two cooperatives only dug 1,500 meters of small canals in fragments, and one water pump could not get enough water, so the remaining three had to "sigh at the canal" and had nowhere to use it.

In addition to the contradiction of interspersed fields, there were also some "knots" between high and low fields. Dry grains are planted in the higher places and rice is planted in the lower places. When there is a drought, the cooperatives in the lower places must draw water through the cooperatives in the higher places, and the water overflows from the narrow and shallow ditches, affecting the normal growth of dry grains in the higher places. When there is a flood, the cooperatives in the lower places want to drain the water, but they have to go through the cooperatives in the higher places, flooding the dry grains in the higher places. One wants to draw water, and the other does not allow drawing; one wants to drain water, and the other does not allow drainage. Unable to draw or drain, some machines cannot be used. When there was internal flooding in 1957, Tianjie, Taiping and other cooperatives in the low-lying areas placed three water pumps to drain the water, but because they had to pass through the Changjiang Cooperative in the high-lying area, and the Changjiang Cooperative was afraid of flooding, they did not allow drainage, and as a result, none of them were used.

The People's Commune linked sixteen advanced cooperatives in high and low places, large and small, into a unified large collective, and these entangled contradictions were completely resolved like a sharp knife cutting through a mess. After the advanced cooperatives with the same natural conditions were merged into a brigade, the land was used uniformly, and the contradiction of interspersed fields naturally disappeared. For some production brigades that were established on the basis of the original advanced cooperatives, the commune helped them to reasonably exchange land according to the principle of equivalent exchange, adjusted the interspersed fields, and also made it possible to dig channels in large quantities. After the Bai Zha and Sun Zhuang advanced cooperatives merged into the Binjiang Brigade, more than 300 laborers were dispatched to construct channels on a large scale according to a unified plan. Last winter and this spring, they built 3,000 meters of main canals, 5,072 meters of main canals, and 5,200 meters of branch canals, exceeding the total length of canals built in the past three years by more than eight times, and all four water pumps were used. The commune members said: "The People's Commune has turned dead machines into living ones." This brigade has more than 3,000 mu of high fields, which the masses call "reed root land, colander fields, watering in the morning and drying at night." These fields used to have reduced yields in small droughts and no harvests in large droughts. Because of the contradiction of interspersed fields, the water pumps could not be used, and the commune members said angrily: "Isn't this like hugging a golden egg and starving!" In 1959, there was a severe drought that even the elderly in their seventies and eighties had never experienced before, but the four water pumps were turned on together, and the water was continuously poured into the fields day and night. As a result, not a single rice leaf was injured. After the contradiction of interspersed fields was resolved, the entire commune built 120,000 cubic meters of large and small canals in the past year, and a complete irrigation system was formed between the brigades, and the water pumps no longer worried about having no way to draw water.

While building a large number of canals, the commune concentrated more than 4,000 laborers last winter and this spring to build and dredge seven rivers and build and repair seven culverts according to a unified water conservancy plan, connecting the new and old ditches and rivers between the high and low fields into a unified water system. One of the Jing'an Rivers under construction is 44 meters wide and 6 meters deep, with a planned total length of 14 li, and 7 li have now been completed. When there was heavy rain and flooding in the summer of 1959, the accumulated water in the low fields was all discharged into the Jing'an River; during the severe drought in the autumn, the endless water flow of the Jing'an River supplied the needs of dozens of water pumps. The historical water conservancy contradictions were completely eliminated, and the water pumps in the high and low places exerted their power without hindrance.

After the contradictions were eliminated and the water system was unified, the commune uniformly established 28 machine pumping stations according to the needs of water sources, terrain, and drainage and irrigation. In the past, because the channels were small, most of the water pumps only drained water and did not irrigate or irrigated very little. Now, they irrigate when water is needed, and drain water when there is too much water, using both drainage and irrigation, day and night, so that the potential of the machines is fully utilized. Compared with advanced cooperatives, the annual irrigation area of each water pump increased from 1394 mu to 1964 mu, and the comprehensive utilization days increased from an average of 40 days a year to 288 days. In 1959, the rice irrigation area of the entire commune increased from 1400 mu to 49000 mu, and 39400 mu were also drained.

    Machines Became "All-Rounders"

During the advanced cooperative era, another reason that hindered the full exertion of mechanical power was that the agricultural machinery was mainly concentrated in a Changjiang Agricultural Cooperative. The scope of activities of one cooperative is ultimately smaller, which makes it impossible to comprehensively utilize the machinery. For example, the six tractors that the state handed over to this cooperative were all planted with dry grains, and the stubble time was roughly the same, and the harvesting and planting time was relatively concentrated. The tractors could only be used for plowing the land within twenty or thirty days. How to arrange the remaining time? During the drainage season, one-third of the 19 water pumps in this brigade could not be "hung up" to drain water, and the tractors were even less likely to participate in drainage. After 1957, although tractors were used for transportation, the total transportation volume was only 34 tons throughout the year, and each tractor was only used for about 70 days a year on average. However, the Binjiang and Huayuan cooperatives had more than 13,000 mu of dry land, and they eagerly hoped for tractor cultivation but could not get it.

After the establishment of the People's Commune, this situation was quickly changed. The commune established a machine station, transferred the six tractors from the Changjiang Brigade, and implemented unified management, so that the tractors were reasonably used in a larger area. According to the different stubble times and seasons of various crops in each brigade, the machine station arranged the use plan separately and successively in a unified manner. After harrowing the early stubble, harrow the late stubble, and after plowing the dry land, plow the paddy fields; after all the plowing work is completed, go to the embankment fields to draw water. During the summer plowing and planting in the summer of 1958, when the six tractors of the Changjiang Agricultural Cooperative had already plowed the land and put it into the warehouse, more than 3,000 mu of dry land in the neighboring Sun Zhuang and Bai Zha agricultural cooperatives had not yet been plowed. They did not have enough manpower and cattle power. They tried their best to plow the land and sow the seeds, but the season was delayed by more than half a month. The situation was very different during the summer plowing and planting in the summer of 1959. Five tractors drove onto this land, and 3,150 mu of land were plowed in less than a week, and the plowing was deep, uniform, and smooth. After the tractors were uniformly managed and reasonably used by the commune, the workload of other tasks such as processing grain, transporting, and pumping water also greatly increased in addition to expanding the amount of machine plowing. Now, the annual utilization days of each tractor have increased from 70 days to 300 days, and the average workload of each standard unit has increased from 33,720 mu to 46,965 mu. The masses said: "The commune can also change the machines! These 'iron oxen' have now become 'positive elements'!"

After the scope of activities expanded, the water pumps were also comprehensively utilized. In addition to irrigating and draining water, the 55 water pumps in the entire commune also processed grain, generated electricity, and threshed during their spare time. In the past year, they processed 10.8 million jin of rations for the commune members alone.

    Repairing with Factories, Operating with People

The lack of technical talents and the inability to carry out mechanical repairs were also problems that caused headaches in the development of agricultural mechanization during the advanced cooperative era. After the establishment of the commune, this difficulty was also easily solved.

During the advanced cooperative era, in addition to a Changjiang Agricultural Cooperative having its own lathe and drilling machine to repair machine parts on a small scale, the other dozen cooperatives had to go to Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi and other places to repair even a screw. Even the Changjiang Agricultural Cooperative had no way to perform tasks such as planing, welding, and casting due to the lack of equipment and incomplete types of work. After the commune was established in early 1959, the commune established a mechanical repair factory. In addition to renting the two machines of the Changjiang Brigade, it also took out more than 13,000 yuan to purchase four lathes, a cylinder boring machine, a motor and other equipment, and added electric welding, oxygen welding and sand casting and other types of work. Now, general parts can be repaired in the time it takes to eat a meal, and larger machine repairs only take three to five days. Because the equipment is constantly expanding and the technology is constantly improving, the number of repair items has also increased from more than 300 to more than 800, and most of the major repair items can be undertaken by themselves.

While the problem of mechanical repair was being solved, the team of technical personnel was also rapidly expanding. The commune has successively held three technical training classes, training more than 180 machine personnel, and trained a group of lathe, fitter, electrician, and welder workers in the mechanical repair factory by means of masters leading apprentices. During the advanced cooperative era, the Changjiang Agricultural Cooperative trained more than 90 technical personnel. Because the scope of machine use was small, only more than 60 people were used to operate the machines in one year, while the other 12 agricultural cooperatives with machines could not find formal machinists. Now, in addition to the commune training new recruits, technical cooperation has also been launched between the brigades, and more than 30 machine personnel have been transferred from the Changjiang Brigade to support the brigades lacking technical personnel. With new and old hands, there are now 244 machine personnel in the entire commune, with an average of 10 to 15 machine personnel in each of the 16 brigades.

    "Two Resolutions" and "One Promotion"

As a result of the rapid development of agricultural mechanization in the past year, the two major problems of being prone to waterlogging, drought, and labor shortage, which have not been resolved in history, have been basically resolved, greatly promoting the increase in agricultural and sideline production. The significant increase in mechanical irrigation power and the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects have completely overturned this famous "big water tank." Between the summer and autumn of 1959, this area successively experienced floods equivalent to those in 1956 and a major drought that had not occurred in a century, and still maintained the bumper harvest of autumn crops. In 1956, when there was a major flood, 8,000 mu of crops were completely lost, and 29,000 mu of crops were reduced by 40%; in the summer of 1958, when it did not rain for 20 days, 30,000 mu of rice were reduced by more than 20%. At the same time, after the amount of machine plowing and irrigation was expanded, a total of 947,500 labor days were saved in 1959, which were transferred to strengthen field management, increase fertilizer accumulation, and develop sideline production. In 1959, the weeding and hoeing of rice and dry grains generally increased from one or two times in the past to three or four times, and the labor force used for field management increased from an average of five workdays per mu in the past to eleven workdays. During the summer harvest and planting in the summer of 1957, because there was a shortage of labor and there was no time to thresh, the sixteen advanced cooperatives rotted about 1.6 million jin of grain, and the sowing season was delayed by more than ten days. In 1959, not only was the entire summer harvest threshing and sowing completed more than ten days earlier than in 1958, but also 4,000 people were drawn to engage in fertilizer accumulation, making the topdressing amount of more than 12,000 mu of late rice 80% more than last year. In addition, more than 700 people were drawn to invest in sideline production. All of these have directly promoted a greater leap forward in agricultural and sideline production. Following the extraordinary bumper harvest of "three wheat" in the summer of 1959, the autumn crops are also showing a gratifying good growth trend, and it is estimated that the yield will be 20% higher than in 1958. The total grain output for the year is expected to reach more than 57 million jin, with an average yield of more than 700 jin per mu, an increase of 14% compared to 1958. Sideline income will also increase by 18.6%. On this basis, the average annual income of each commune member in the entire commune will increase from 74 yuan in 1958 to 95 yuan.

The commune members, who have personally experienced the superiority of the People's Commune and the benefits of agricultural mechanization, are full of greater confidence and strength in further running the People's Commune and realizing agricultural mechanization. They have initially formulated a development plan for the next three years. In 1962, the total annual income will increase by 123.7% compared with 1959. On this basis, they will increase 20 tractors and 20 large threshers, so that 32,000 mu of intertidal land will be fully mechanized from cultivation to threshing. In the embankment area, in addition to developing mechanization, 18 electric pumping stations will also be built, so that 45,000 mu of paddy fields will be fully irrigated with electricity, ensuring a bumper harvest in the event of any drought or flood. At the same time, they will also vigorously develop mechanical transportation, so that the mechanical transportation volume will increase from the current 16,000 tons to 50,000 tons. They firmly believe that with the wise leadership of the Party and the superior system of the People's Commune, this plan will definitely become a reality in a shorter period of time.

    人民公社大大解放了生产力
    ——长江人民公社加快了农业机械化速度调查
    窦天语　姜显贵　姜韦才　任荣华　施兆祥
    江苏省江宁县长江人民公社建社一年，就显示出公社对加速实现农业机械化比农业生产合作社有更大的优越性。社员们说：“人民公社给我们添上翅膀啦！”
    霞光江水伴机鸣
    长江公社有八千九百零四户，三万六千一百五十七人，八万五千四百一十三亩土地，是由十六个高级社合并成立的。解放以前，这里是个有名的“大水缸”、“穷窝窝”。平均每三年便有一次破堤倒圩和两次内涝灾害。地多劳力少，耕种来不及，十亩倒有三亩荒，麦子长得“癞蛤蟆举手高”。从解放到建立初级社，这里的生产条件和经济生活有了不少改变，但是每个劳动力还要负担九亩多地，内涝灾害仍然相当严重。人们要求迅速改变这种情况，强烈地向往实现农业机械化。社员们常说：“那天能用上‘铁龙’打水、‘铁牛’耕田，光喝三天凉水也心甜！”高级社成立后，国家把六台拖拉机交给了规模较大的长江高级社使用，有一部分高级社也买了抽水机，可是，由于农业社范围小、力量薄等等条件的限制，农业机械化前进的步子比较缓慢，十六个社的机器灌溉面积只有一千四百亩，机耕面积也只有三千九百多亩。人民公社诞生后，社员们的这个要求实现了。一年来农业机械化事业正像一只凌空的大鹏展开了巨翅，一日千里地前进着。全公社机灌面积比高级社时扩大了三十四倍，80％的农田实现了机械灌溉，1959年秋耕三万八千五百亩旱田，有一半以上使用了拖拉机耕作。现在，全公社已有拖拉机十二台，抽水机五十五台，大型自动脱粒机一部，收割机两部，播种机十部，各种机犁、机耙十五部，另外还有一艘机帆船和六部机动拖车。人们一踏进这个公社，就可以看到一幅动人的“机械耕作图”：当灿烂的朝霞刚刚染红江面的时候，这片水网交织、阡陌纵横的平原上，就响起了轰隆隆的马达声。在二十多处机械排灌站里，抽水机喷吐着银龙般的水柱，把驯服的江水引到田里。拖拉机牵引着闪闪发光的五铧犁、九铧犁，把大块大块乌油油的肥土翻了上来。稻场上，自动脱谷机以每小时脱粒两千五百斤的速度，把堆得像小山样的稻捆吞噬下去……。
    添新鞍　买壮马
    人民公社在短短时间里办了高级社几年没有办到的事情，这首先是由于公社扩大了公共积累，为农业机械化建设提供了高级社所不能提供的大量资金。
    从1956年秋季到1958年夏季，十六个高级社一共积累了资金三十八万四千元，平均每个社一年积累一万二千元。一万多块钱不算少，但要买大型农业机械，那可就困难了。天界高级社的社员们从1955年就想买部抽水机，一直没钱买。花园高级社买了一部抽水机，却再也没钱买水泵，“有钱买马，无力置鞍”。有什么办法？除了稻子上场后，用这部机器给稻子加工，剩下的日子就不能充分利用。情况较好的只是一个长江农业社。这个社大些，积累也多些。1956年国家把六台拖拉机交给他们使用后，社里自己又添置了一部脱粒机、两部收割机和一部抽水机。其余十五个高级社只有十一个社添了九部抽水机。
    公社成立后，组织规模扩大了，群众的积极性充分地调动起来了，生产就跨上了“千里马”。一年来，全公社总收入比前一年增长了24.4％，积累资金达637，622元。有了雄厚的物质基础，农业机械化便伸开了翅膀。有机器的队锦上添花，没机器的队也从无到有。盼望“铁龙”盼了几年没到手的四个大队，欢天喜地抬回了七台抽水机。天界大队一年中积累了三万五千多块钱，一下子就拿出九千元买了一台抽水机，又拨出六千元准备再添置一台。刘庄生产队地势高，解放前大旱缺水时，需要花五角钱买水灌溉一亩地；高级社时，水利条件改变了，但仍要架上三道水车日夜车水。今年有了机器，二百多亩水稻全部得到机械灌溉。
    公社也从生产大队提取的公共积累和社办企业的利润中，拿出十四万九千五百元，购置了六台拖拉机，两部抽水机，一艘机帆船，四部机动拖车和一部分大型耕作机械，在耕作、排灌、运输和加工等各个方面，全面增强了机械力量。社员们深切体会到，公社化是加速实现农业机械化的主要保证。
    解“疙瘩”“铁龙”展神威
    人民公社克服了高级社小集体的局限性，扩大了活动范围，使农业机械的潜力也大大地得到了发挥。现在，一台抽水机的使用效率抵上了过去五、六台；一台拖拉机一年内干出了过去三年、五年干的活。
    说来也真是怪事情。高级社时，一方面是机器少，大家想买买不起；另一方面却是不少现有的机器在“三天打鱼，两天晒
  网”。建立高级社的三年中，平均每台抽水机每年只使用四十天。这是什么缘故呢？
    原因之一，是高级社之间在水利上的矛盾解决不了，水系无法统一规划，渠道不能大量开挖，水不能畅其流，抽水机也就不能尽其用。这个矛盾的一个具体表现，是各社之间插花田的问题。像合并为现在的滨江大队的柏闸、孙庄两个高级社，当时有四、五百亩田犬牙交错在一起。两社都有两部抽水机，都需要开挖渠道。但是，谁来开呢？孙庄要开，一挖就得挖到柏闸的田。柏闸人说：“挖我们的田灌你们的田，那有这等便宜事？”孙庄要拿田去换，又有了问题：他们的土质差些，柏闸的土质好些。以好换孬岂不吃亏？不行！修渠的事就只好不了了之。三年中，两个社只各自片片段段地挖了一千五百米的小渠，一部抽水机打水还吃不饱，剩下的三部就只好“望渠兴叹”，无用武之地。
    除了插花田的矛盾之外，高田、低田之间也存在着一些“疙瘩”。这里高处种旱谷，低处种水稻。天旱时，低处的社引水必须经过高处的社，水从狭浅的小沟里漫溢出来，影响高地旱谷的正常生长。天涝时，低处的社排涝，又要经过高处的社，淹没了高地的旱谷。一个要引水，一个不让引；一个要排水，一个不让排。引不成来排不成，一些机器也就不能利用。1957年内涝时，低处的天界、太平等社摆了三部抽水机排水，因为必须经过高处的长江社，而长江社怕淹，不让排水，结果一部也没有用得上。
    人民公社把高处和低处、大的和小的十六个高级社联成了一个统一的大集体，这些缠来缠去的矛盾，就像快刀斩乱麻，彻底地解决了。自然条件相同的高级社并为一个大队后，土地统一使用，插花田的矛盾自然也就没有了。对于有些以原来高级社为基础建立起来的生产大队，公社根据等价交换的原则，帮助他们合理地调换土地，调整了插花田，也使大量开挖渠道成为可能。柏闸、孙庄两个高级社合并为滨江大队后，出动了三百多个劳动力，按照统一的规划，大规模兴修渠道。去冬今春，他们便修好了3000米干渠，5072米主渠和5200多米支渠，超过了过去三年修渠总长度的八倍多，四部抽水机全部用上了。社员说：“人民公社把死机器变活了。”这个大队有三千多亩高田，群众说它是“芦根地，漏勺田，早上车水晚上干”。这些田过去是小旱减产，大旱无收。因为插花田的矛盾，抽水机用不上，社员们气愤地说：
  “这不是抱着金蛋子挨大饿嘛！”1959年，遇到了七、八十岁的老年人也是头一次经历的大干旱，可是，四部抽水机一齐开动，水日夜不停地灌到田里，结果，一片稻叶子也没有受伤。在插花田的矛盾解决之后，一年来，全公社共修建了十二万立方的大小渠道，各个大队之间形成了一个完整的灌溉系统，抽水机再不愁车水无路了。
    在大量兴修渠道的同时，公社根据统一的水利规划，又在去冬今春集中四千多个民工，兴修和疏浚了七条河道，新建和整修了七处涵闸，使高田、低田之间的新旧沟、河连接成了一个统一的水系。其中一条正在兴修的靖安河，宽有四十四米，深有六米，计划全长十四华里，现已完成七华里。1959年夏季大雨成涝时，低田的积水一古脑排到了靖安河里；秋季大旱时，靖安河源源不尽的水流又供应了几十部抽水机的需要。历史性的水利矛盾消除得一干二净，高处、低处的抽水机都一往无阻地发挥了它的威力。
    矛盾消除，水系统一之后，公社根据水源、地势和排灌的需要，统一建立了二十八个机器排灌站。过去因为渠道小，大部分抽水机只排不灌或灌得很少，现在，用水时就灌，水多了便排，排灌并用，日夜不停，使机器的潜力得到了充分的发挥。同高级社比较，每台抽水机的全年灌溉面积由1394亩提高到1964亩，综合利用天数由平均一年40天提高到288天。1959年全公社的水稻灌溉面积由1400亩扩大到49000亩，另外还排涝39400亩。
    机器成了“多面手”
    高级社时，阻碍机械力量充分发挥的还有另外一个原因，这就是：当时的农业机械主要集中在一个长江农业社。一个社的活动范围终究还是较小的，这就使机械没有办法综合利用。譬如说，国家交给这个社使用的六台拖拉机，因为他们种的都是旱谷，茬口时间大致一样，收种时间比较集中，拖拉机耕地只能限在二、三十天之内，其余的时间怎样安排？排涝的时候，这个大队的十九部抽水机还有三分之一“挂”不上排水的“号”，更轮不上拖拉机参加排涝。1957年以后，虽然使用拖拉机运输，全年运输量只有三十四吨，平均每台拖拉机每年只使用七十天左右。而滨江、花园等几个社，却有一万三千多亩旱地，眼巴巴地盼望拖拉机耕作盼不到手。
    人民公社建立之后，这种情况迅速地得到了改变。公社成立了一个机务站，把六台拖拉机调出长江大队，实行统一管理，使拖拉机在更大的范围内得到了合理使用。根据各个大队各种作物茬口不同、季节不一的情况，机务站分别先后统一安排了使用计划。耙完了早茬耙晚茬，耕完了旱地耕沤田；耕田的活全干完了，便到圩田去打水。1958年夏耕夏种中，当长江农业社六台拖拉机已经耕完了地并放进库里的时候，邻近的孙庄、柏闸农业社三千多亩旱地却还没有耕。他们人力、牛力都不够。千方百计耕完了地并把种子撒下去了，但季节已迟误了半个多月。1959年夏耕夏种时，情况大大不同了，五部拖拉机开到了这片土地上，三千一百五十亩地不到一个星期就耕完了，而且耕得又深、又匀、又平整。拖拉机由公社统一管理、合理使用以后，除扩大了机耕量外，其他如加工粮食、运输和抽水的工作量也都大为增加。现在，每部拖拉机的全年利用日数，已从七十天提高到三百天，每个标准台的平均工作量由33，720个折实亩提高到46，965个折实亩。群众说：“公社还能改变机器呢！这些‘铁牛’现在都变成‘积极分子’了！”
    活动范围扩大后，抽水机也得到了综合利用。全公社五十五部抽水机除了灌水、排水，还趁空闲时间加工粮食、发电和脱粒等。一年来，单为社员加工的口粮就有一千零八十万斤。
    修理有厂　操纵有人
    缺乏技术人材和无力进行机械修配，也是在高级社时发展农业机械化事业中伤透脑筋的事。公社成立之后，这个困难也就迎刃而解。
    高级社时，除了一个长江农业社自有一部车床和一台钻床可以小修机器零件之外，其他十几个社即使坏了一个螺丝钉，都得到南京、常州、无锡等地去修理。就是长江农业社，由于设备少，工种不全，遇到需要刨、焊、铸等活，也是没有办法。1959年初公社化后，公社建立了一个机械修配厂。除了租用了长江大队的两部机器外，又拿出一万三千多元添购了四台车床、一台搪缸机、一台电机等设备，增加了电焊、氧焊和翻砂等工种。现在，一般零件送去修理，一顿饭时间就能拿货，较大的机件修理，也只要三、五天工夫。因为设备不断扩充，技术不断提高，修理项目也从三百多种增加到八百多种，绝大部分大修项目，都能由自己担负了。
    与机械修理问题获得解决的同时，技术人员的队伍也迅速地扩大了。公社先后举办了三期技术训练班，培养了一百八十多名机务人员，并在机械修配厂中用师傅带徒弟的办法，训练了一批车、钳、电、焊工。高级社时，长江农业社曾经培养了九十多名技术人员，因为机器的使用范围小，一年中只有六十多人用于操纵机器，而其他十二个有机器的农业社，却找不到正式机工。现在，除了公社培训新手以外，各大队之间又展开了技术上的协作，由长江大队调出三十多名机务人员，支援缺乏技术人员的大队。新手加上老手，现在全公社已有二百四十四名机务人员，十六个大队平均每个队都有十名到十五名机务人员。
    “两解决”“一推进”
    一年来农业机械化迅速发展的结果，基本上解决了历史上没能解决的易涝、易旱和劳动力紧张这两个大问题，大大推进了农副业的增产速度。机械灌溉力量的显著增加和水利工程的大量兴修，把这个有名的“大水缸”彻底打翻了。1959年夏、秋之间，这里先后经历了相当于1956年的涝灾和百年未有的大旱灾，仍然保住了秋熟作物的丰收。而1956年大涝时，这里有八千亩庄稼颗粒无收，两万九千亩庄稼减产四成；1958年夏季有二十天没下雨，就有三万亩水稻减产二成以上。同时，在机耕、机灌量扩大之后，1959年共节省了九十四万七千五百多个劳动日，转用于加强田间管理、增积肥料和发展副业生产等方面。1959年水稻、旱谷的耘耥、除草，一般由过去一、二遍增加到三、四遍，用于田间管理的劳动力，平均每亩由过去五个工增加到十一个工。1957年夏收夏种时，因为缺工来不及脱粒，十六个高级社共霉烂了粮食约一百六十多万斤，播种季节还延迟了十多天。1959年不但整个夏收脱粒和播种比1958年提早了十天以上，还抽出四千人大搞积肥，使一万二千多亩晚稻的追肥量比去年增加了80％。另外又抽出七百多人投入了副业生产。所有这些，都直接促进了农副业生产的更大跃进。1959年继夏季“三麦”特大丰收之后，秋熟作物又是一片喜人的好长势，估计可比1958年增产二成。全年粮食总产量预计可达五千七百多万斤，平均亩产七百多斤，比1958年增加14％。副业收入也将增加18.6％。在这个基础上，全公社平均每个社员的全年收入将从1958年的七十四元增长到九十五元。
    亲身体验到人民公社优越性和农业机械化好处的社员们，对进一步办好人民公社和实现农业机械化充满了更大的信心和力量。他们已初步制订了今后三年的发展规划。1962年，全年总收入将比1959年增加123.7％，在这个基础上，要增加拖拉机二十台，大型脱粒机二十部，使三万二千亩洲地从耕种到脱粒全部实行机械化。在圩区，除了发展机械化，还要建立十八个电力排灌站，使四万五千亩水田全部利用电力灌溉，做到在任何旱涝灾害的情况下都确保丰收。同时，还要大力发展机械运输，使机械运输量由现在的一万六千吨增加到五万吨。他们坚信，有党的英明领导，有人民公社的优越制度，这个规划一定能在更短的时间内变成现实。
