　　The First Year of "Stormy" Advance
　　By Zhang Xinmin, our reporter

    1959 was an extraordinary year on the industrial front of the German Democratic Republic. From the Oder-Neisse River to the Elbe River, from the Baltic Sea to the Thuringian Mountains, every factory, every mine, every construction site, every enterprise was rushing towards socialist victory at a "stormy" pace.

    The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany pointed out at its recent Seventh Plenary Session that the total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic will exceed the plan by 102% this year. In the economic competition with West Germany, the total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic will increase by more than 12% this year compared to last year, while West Germany, which has created the so-called "economic miracle," is expected to grow by 6% this year. The industrial development speed of the German Democratic Republic is exactly double that of West Germany.

    1959 was the first year of the German Democratic Republic's Seven-Year Plan. Although this grand plan to win socialist victory in the German Democratic Republic in seven years was only officially announced in early October, the working class had been working diligently for its realization since the beginning of this year and regarded this year as a "decisive year."

    The chemical industry is the core of the Seven-Year Plan. This year, chemical workers and engineering technicians not only completed a production plan that increased by 10% compared to last year, but their pioneering spirit also set an example for the whole country. Young workers at the Bitterfeld Electrochemical Combine first proposed the slogan of working, living, and studying in a socialist way at the beginning of the year. This movement to win the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team" spread rapidly like "oil on water." Currently, more than 2.5 million employees are involved in this movement, of which 400,000 advanced employees form the backbone of this socialist labor competition. Employees participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" are not only pioneers in completing production tasks, but also show their enthusiastic activities in improving the political awareness of employees and learning a second professional skill. The "Socialist Work Collective" or "Socialist Research Collective" jointly organized by engineering technicians, master workers, and ordinary workers was also first initiated in the chemical industry. This kind of "Socialist Collective" can not only discover and solve key problems in production, but more importantly, it strengthens the unity of the working class and intellectuals, and helps scientific and technical personnel better integrate with reality and the masses of workers. The role played by the "Socialist Labor Team" and "Socialist Collective" movement in accelerating the development of industrial production this year is increasingly being given priority.

    In the socialist labor competition, the "Socialist Mutual Assistance" movement of advanced helping backward initiated in the textile industry fully reflects the high political awareness that the working class of the German Democratic Republic is developing. Lichtel, a female worker at the Zittau Textile United Factory, did not put personal income first. Disregarding the cold remarks of some people around her, she first proposed giving up her high salary and going to work in a production team that was unable to complete its tasks. She put it well: what does it matter how much personal income I have, as long as I can contribute to exceeding West German production as soon as possible, and add strength to the struggle to defend peace as soon as possible, I feel that I have fulfilled my responsibility! This middle-aged female worker's exemplary action is an example for all advanced workers. Thousands of advanced workers quickly took action and launched the "Socialist Mutual Assistance" movement. Currently, this movement is flourishing not only in the textile industry, but also in various departments; it is not only mutual assistance between production teams and workshops in the same unit, but also forms mutual assistance between factories; participants in this movement include not only workers, but also engineering and technical personnel. In the struggle to complete the annual production plan one week ahead of schedule at the end of this year, it is a powerful assault force.

    Completing the investment plan is the focus of the first few years of the Seven-Year Plan. This year, construction workers are undertaking heavy tasks, with the total national investment reaching 14.7 billion marks. The workload of construction workers has increased by 16.9% compared to last year. The construction industry was still a backward sector in the German Democratic Republic last year, but after the summer construction conference this year, it jumped to an advanced position. Before 1959 was over, employees on the construction front had already reported to the whole country that they had overfulfilled the annual plan with a score of 102.5%. The growth rate of the construction industry this year increased by 23% compared to last year. Among the thirty-odd large projects newly built, expanded, and continued to be built nationwide this year, four have been completed and seven have been partially put into production. Construction began this year on: one of Europe's largest paper mills, the German Democratic Republic's first television vacuum tube factory, two major backbone projects in the "Chemical Program" - the Schwedt Oil Refinery and the Chemical Fiber United Factory, and the Weichao Power Station with a power generation capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts.

    In the "stormy" development, the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party plays a decisive role.

    The Fifth Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held in May decided to use the socialist transformation of industry as a concrete policy for realizing the Seven-Year Plan. Due to the limitation of labor force, developing production through scientific and technological progress has special significance in the German Democratic Republic. Scientific and technological progress is not only the center of the labor competition, but also the main content of the socialist transformation of industry. The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party pointed out that the socialist transformation will be carried out in two ways: one is to update equipment and adopt the most modern technology in key departments. The other is to make production more rational and facilitate the use of modern technology on the basis of existing equipment in other more departments through standardization, typification, and specialization. Among the two ways, the latter is the focus. In just over half a year, the results of this policy have been clearly reflected in the improvement of labor productivity. This year, the increase in industrial labor productivity in the German Democratic Republic will not be the original 9.6%, but will exceed 10%. In various departments of the mechanical industry, the increase in labor productivity has exceeded 15% or 20%.

    The industrial standardization demonstration exhibition held not long ago was another mobilization meeting to further implement the policy of socialist transformation. Six hundred thousand people visited this exhibition in thirty-five days, and the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party also held an on-site meeting with thousands of participants. Now economic work cadres, technical circles, workers, and research and academic institutions related to industry across the country are acting in accordance with this policy, preparing to invest in the new battle next year.

    The party's grassroots organizations in industrial and mining enterprises have also played a greater role this year than in the past. Ensuring the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan has become the central task and the basis of all activities of the grassroots party organizations. Party supervision committees have also been organized in grassroots organizations, specifically responsible for supervising the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan in their departments. In this way, the realization of the plan is not only the business of the party's leading organs, but also the responsibility of every party member first and foremost.

    Making full preparations in terms of ideology, organization, and material in advance plays an important role in the development of industry this year. This experience is being used to greet next year's production battle. As early as June this year, the production targets for 1960 were issued to various factories and mines, and then fully discussed among the workers. The financial budget for 1960 was also decided for the first time ten years in advance. The long-term trade agreement signed with the Soviet Union further guarantees the supply of raw materials next year. The workers' morale is even more high-spirited. There is still some time before 1960, but the employees of the "Karl Marx" Measuring Tool Factory in Magdeburg have already sounded the challenge horn for the comprehensive and balanced completion of the production plan next year. In just a few days, employees from dozens of factories across the country have expressed their willingness to accept the challenge.

    In agriculture, the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production have both made further progress this year. The number of members of agricultural production cooperatives has increased by more than 82,000 in the past year. Together with state-owned farms, the area of land managed by the socialist agricultural sector has accounted for 52% of the total cultivated land area in the country. In one-tenth of the country's townships, the degree of cooperativization has reached more than 80%. Despite the most severe drought in a century this year, the commodity production of animal products, which is the most important part of agricultural production, has still increased slightly compared to the past. The Seventh Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party held in December specifically discussed agricultural issues. A mass movement to increase the production of animal products and strive to complete the main agricultural production indicators of the Seven-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule is being widely carried out in rural areas across the country.

    The first year determines the next seven years. People say that this year's "stormy" development is a good starting point. Next year, people confidently predict that the economy of the German Democratic Republic will advance at a higher speed.

### “暴风雨式”前进的第一年

　　“暴风雨式”前进的第一年
　　本报记者　张辛民
    1959年是德意志民主共和国工业战线上的不平凡的一年。从奥得—尼斯河到易北河，从波罗的海到图灵根山区，每个工厂，每个矿山，每个工地，每个企业，到处都以“暴风雨式”前进的速度奔向社会主义胜利。
    德国统一社会党中央政治局在最近举行的七中全会上指出，今年德意志民主共和国工业总产值将以102％超额完成计划。在和西德进行的经济竞赛中，德意志民主共和国工业总产值今年将比去年增加12％以上，而所谓创造了“经济奇迹”的西德，预计今年可能增长6％，德意志民主共和国的工业发展速度恰恰是它的一倍。
    1959年是德意志民主共和国七年计划的第一年。这个争取在七年内在德意志民主共和国赢得社会主义胜利的宏伟计划虽然在10月初才正式公布，但是早从今年一开始，工人阶级就为它的实现而勤奋工作了，并且把今年看作是“决定性的一年”。
    化学工业是七年计划的核心。今年，化学工人和工程技术人员不只完成了比去年增加10％的生产计划，他们的首创精神更给全国树立了榜样。比特菲尔德电气化学联合厂的青年工人，在年初首先提出了按社会主义方式进行工作、生活和学习的口号。这个争取“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号的运动像“水上之油”一样迅速地铺开了。目前投入这个运动的，已有二百五十多万名职工，其中有四十万名先进职工构成了这一社会主义劳动竞赛的中坚。参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的职工，不只是完成生产任务的先锋，而且在提高职工政治觉悟、学会第二种职业技能等各个方面，也都显示了他们的热情蓬勃的活动。由工程技术人员、老师傅和普通工人共同组织的“社会主义工作集体”或“社会主义研究集体”也是首先在化学工业中发起的。这种“社会主义集体”不只在生产中能够发现和解决关键问题，更重要的是它加强了工人阶级和知识分子的团结，帮助科学技术人员更好地同实际、同工人群众相结合。“社会主义劳动队”和“社会主义集体”的运动，在加速今年工业生产发展中所起的作用，日益被提到首要地位。
    在社会主义劳动竞赛中，纺织工业中发起的先进帮助落后的“社会主义互助”运动充分反映了德意志民主共和国工人阶级正在发展着的高度政治觉悟。齐涛纺织联合工厂女工丽希特尔不把个人收入问题放在首要地位，不顾及周围一些人的冷言冷语，首先提出放弃高工资而到完不成任务的生产队中去工作。她说得好，个人收入多少有什么关系呢，只要我能够在早日超过西德生产方面出一把力，早日在保卫和平的斗争中增加一份力量，我才觉得是尽了责任呢！这位中年女工的模范行动是所有先进工人的榜样，千百位先进工人迅速行动起来，掀起了“社会主义互助”运动。目前，这个运动不只是在纺织工业中，而且是在各个部门蓬勃展开着；不只是在同一单位中生产队之间和车间之间的互助，而且形成了厂与厂之间的互助；参加这个运动的不只是工人，还包括了工程技术人员。在今年年底为争取提前一周完成年度生产计划的斗争中，它正是一支强大的突击力量。
    完成投资计划是七年计划头几年的重点。今年建筑工人担负着繁重的任务，国家全年投资总额达一百四十七亿马克。建筑工人的工作量较去年增加16.9％，建筑业去年在德意志民主共和国还是落后的部门，今年夏季建筑会议以后，它一跃而居于先进地位。1959年还没结束，建筑战线上的职工已经以102.5％的成绩超额完成年度计划向全国报捷。今年建筑业的增长速度比去年提高了23％。今年全国新建、扩建和继续建设的三十几项大工程项目中，已先后有四项完工，七项部分投入生产。今年破土动工的有：一座欧洲最大的造纸厂、德意志民主共和国第一个电视机真空管厂、“化学纲领”中的两个大骨干工程——施韦特炼油厂和化学纤维联合厂以及发电能力达一百二十万瓩的韦乔发电站。
    在“暴风雨式”前进的发展中，统一社会党的领导起着决定性的作用。
    5月召开的德国统一社会党五中全会，决定用通过工业的社会主义改建作为实现七年计划的具体方针。由于劳动力的限制，通过科学技术进步发展生产在德意志民主共和国有特别重要的意义。科学技术进步不只是劳动竞赛的中心，而且也是工业社会主义改建的主要内容。统一社会党中央指出，社会主义改建将采取两条道路进行，一条是在重点部门中更新设备，采用最现代的技术。另一条是在其他更多的部门中，通过标准化、定型化、专业化，使生产更加合理，便于在现有设备基础上采用现代技术。在两条道路中又以后者为重点。时间不过半年多，这个方针的结果已经明显地表现在劳动生产率的提高上了。今年德意志民主共和国工业劳动生产率的提高将不是原定的9.6％，而将超过10％。在机械工业各部门，劳动生产率的增加有的超过15％或20％。
    不久前举行的工业标准化示范展览会，又是进一步贯彻社会主义改建方针的动员大会。在三十五天中已有六十万人参观了这个展览会，统一社会党中央还举行了上千人参加的现场会议。现在全国经济工作干部、技术界、工人以及同工业有关的研究和学术机关都在根据这条方针行动起来，准备投入明年的新战斗。
    工矿企业中党的基层组织今年也发挥了比过去更多的作用。保证七年计划的执行，已成为基层党组织的中心任务和全部活动的基础。在基层组织中还组织了党的监督委员会，专门负责监督本部门执行七年计划的情况。这样，计划的实现不只是党的领导机关的事，而且首先是每个党员自己的责任。
    提前充分做好思想、组织和物质三方面的准备，在今年工业的发展中起着重要作用。这个经验正在运用到迎接明年的生产战斗中。还在今年6月，1960年的生产指标就已下达到各个厂矿，以后并在工人群众中进行充分的讨论。1960年的财政预算也是十年来第一次在前一年就决定了。和苏联签订的长期贸易协定，更保证了明年原料的供应。工人们的情绪更是斗志昂扬，距离1960年还有一段时间，但是马格德堡“卡尔·马克思”量具厂的职工已经吹起了明年全面均衡完成生产计划的挑战号角。不过几天，全国已有几十个工厂的职工表示了应战。
    在农业方面，今年，农业合作化运动和农业生产都有了进一步的发展。农业生产合作社的社员一年来增加了八万二千多人。连同国营农场在内，社会主义农业部门所经营的土地面积，已占全国耕地总面积的52％。全国有十分之一的乡的合作化程度，达到了80％以上。尽管今年遭到百年来最严重的干旱，但作为农业生产中最重要部分的畜产品，它的商品生产仍比过去略有提高。统一社会党12月召开的七中全会，专门讨论了农业问题。一个提高畜产品生产、争取提前两年完成七年计划的农业生产主要指标的群众性运动，正在全国农村普遍开展。
    七年看头年。人们说，今年的“暴风雨式”发展是一个良好的起点。明年，人们满怀信心地预言，德意志民主共和国的经济将以更高速度前进。
