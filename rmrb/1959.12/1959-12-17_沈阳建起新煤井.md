A pair of inclined shafts at the Shenbei Coalfield, which is under construction, has recently been handed over for production, and the construction of two other large vertical shafts has started ahead of schedule. The newly delivered pair of inclined shafts can produce 300,000 tons of raw coal annually. The two large vertical shafts that are being built ahead of schedule will each produce 900,000 tons and 600,000 tons of coal annually after completion.
