　　Dazu County Establishes Subsidiary Food Base Network
　　Base Supplies Account for 30%-70% of the County's Commodity Volume
　　(Our Dispatch) How to establish commodity production bases within a county? Dazu County in Sichuan Province has provided a successful experience in this regard.
　　In order to meet the growing needs of the people in large cities and industrial and mining areas for subsidiary food, and to achieve planned production and supply of commodities, Dazu County established 23 state-owned subsidiary food commodity production bases and more than 80 people's commune commodity production bases last winter and this spring. Among them, the state-owned commodity production bases include 15 pig farms with 500 to 1,000 pigs each, raising a total of more than 13,000 pigs; three vegetable gardens with more than 300 mu each, which have produced more than 5 million jin of vegetables; and two fish ponds with more than 150 mu each, which have bred more than 80 million fish fry. In addition, the county's 39 people's communes have also established 39 pig farms and fish farms each, as well as a large number of orchards, vegetable gardens, etc. As of the end of November, the county's commodity bases had transferred more than 12,000 pigs to other areas, accounting for 30% of the county's total external transfer; transferred and supplied 240,000 chickens, ducks, and other poultry to local markets, 900,000 jin of fresh fish, and more than 30 million jin of vegetables, which accounted for 70% of the external transfer and market supply.
　　Dazu County has the following experiences in establishing commodity bases: (1) Establishing specialized institutions to strengthen leadership over the bases. The county, district, and commune party committees each have a deputy secretary or committee member responsible for specific leadership. The county's bases also have unified planning, and commodity production is arranged in a timely manner according to the needs of the state and the market. (2) Industry, agriculture, and commerce are united as one to support each other. Commercial and financial departments participate in the leadership of the bases, send cadres to help key bases arrange production and sales, and allocate advance purchase funds to support the establishment of commune bases. Industrial departments actively supply improved tools, pesticides, and fertilizers according to the needs of base production and development. (3) Selecting suitable locations for establishing bases. The 23 state-owned commodity bases established in the county were all built by expanding on the basis of the original farms, breeding farms, and other suitable areas of agricultural, commercial, and financial departments. These bases are the core of the county's commodity bases. The bases established by communes or management areas are mainly established in reservoirs, ponds, orchards, barren mountains, and areas with base development conditions. (4) In arranging base production, it is necessary to take into account the current market needs for commodities and do a good job in production in a timely manner, while also planning for long-term production and development. While doing a good job in pig fattening and vegetable production in a timely manner, Dazu County also makes full use of more than 60 reservoirs to raise a large number of fish; and uses barren mountains and slopes to develop orchards, vegetable gardens, and other bases, in order to lay a good foundation for the further development of commodity production. (5) Focus on the production of major subsidiary foods, while gradually developing diversified economic commodity production bases. On the basis of ensuring the supply of subsidiary foods to the market, the county has also successively developed silkworm, medicinal material, and other industrial raw material production bases. At present, a complete commodity production base network has been formed in the county.

　　大足县建成副食品基地网
    基地供应部分占全县商品量30％—70％
    本报讯　在一县范围内如何建立商品生产基地？四川省大足县在这个问题上提供了成功的经验。
    为了适应大城市和工矿区人民对副食品日益增长的需要，并作到有计划的生产和供应商品，大足县去冬今春建立国营副食商品生产基地二十三处和人民公社商品生产基地八十多处。其中国营商品生产基地包括五百至一千头的养猪场十五个，共养猪一万三千多头；三百亩以上的蔬菜园三个，已生产蔬菜五百多万斤；一百五十亩以上的鱼塘二个，已繁殖鱼苗八千多万尾。另外，全县三十九个人民公社还建立养猪场、养鱼场各三十九个，和大量的果园、蔬菜园等。截至11月底止，全县商品基地共外调猪一万二千多头，占全县外调总数的30％；外调和供应当地市场鸡鸭等家禽二十四万多只，鲜鱼九十多万斤，蔬菜三千多万斤，这些都占外调和上市量的70％。
    大足县建立商品基地有如下经验：（一）建立专门机构，加强对基地的领导。县、区、公社，各级党委都有一个副书记或委员分工负责，具体领导。全县基地并有统一规划，根据国家和市场需要，及时安排商品生产。（二）工农商拧成一股绳，互相支援。商业和财经部门参加基地领导工作，派干部帮助重点基地安排生产和销路，并拨出预购资金，支援公社基地的建立。工业部门根据基地生产发展的需要，积极供应改良工具、农药和化肥。（三）选好建立基地场所。全县建立的二十三个国营商品基地，都是以原有的农、商、财经部门的农场、饲养场及其他适宜的地区为基点，进一步扩大建成的。这些基地是全县商品基地的核心。公社或管理区建立的基地，以水库、水塘、果园、荒山和具备基地发展条件的地区为主建立的。（四）在安排基地生产中，既照顾目前市场商品的需要，及时作好生产工作，同时又要为长远生产发展作好规划。大足县在及时作好猪的育肥、蔬菜生产的同时，还充分利用六十多座水库，大量养鱼；利用荒山野坡，发展果园、菜园等基地，为商品生产的进一步发展打好基础。（五）以主要副食品生产为主，同时逐步发展多种经济商品生产基地。在保证市场副食品供应的基础上，全县还陆续发展了蚕桑、药材及其他工业原料生产基地。目前，在全县已经形成一个完整的商品生产基地网。
