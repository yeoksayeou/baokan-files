Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 11th—Zhejiang Province's winter water conservancy campaign has entered a high tide. Currently, the labor force participating in water conservancy construction in various regions has reached four times that of the same period last year, and the province has already completed 24,811 various water conservancy projects.

This winter, the scale of water conservancy construction in Zhejiang Province has exceeded any previous year, and the commencement time has also been more than a month earlier than in previous years. During the winter repairs, various regions, in conjunction with their local conditions, implemented a series of two-pronged approaches: combining storage and drainage, with emphasis on storage; combining mountain and water management, with emphasis on mountain management; combining large, medium, and small projects, with emphasis on small projects; combining irrigation, power generation, and navigation, with emphasis on irrigation; combining mass self-reliance and necessary state assistance, with emphasis on mass self-reliance; and combining new construction and maintenance, with emphasis on new construction. In mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, large-scale water storage and diversion projects are being carried out to gradually build complete irrigation networks and advance towards realizing self-flowing irrigation. In plain areas, vigorous efforts are being made to build dams and merge polders, organize and develop river networks, lower groundwater levels, develop mechanical drainage and irrigation, realize mechanized drainage and irrigation, and actively develop electric irrigation. Wuxing County, located in the Hangjiahu Plain, mobilized more than 80,000 people, and after ten days of hard work and ingenuity, completed the task of building dams and merging polders. Currently, channel alignment and measurement are underway; the excavation tasks for the three-level system of main, branch, and capillary channels, with a total length of 4,700 kilometers, have been assigned to production teams, and 110 kilometers of channels have already been excavated. In coastal areas such as Zhoushan and Wenzhou, seawalls and river embankments are being extensively repaired to improve typhoon and flood resistance capabilities. More than 30,000 workers in Ruian County are building a 60-kilometer-long, 30-meter-wide seawall on the coast of the East China Sea.

In order to speed up the construction progress, all water conservancy sites have mobilized the masses to carry out tool reforms and launch high-efficiency competitions. According to incomplete statistics, the province has promoted more than 282,000 pieces of various new-style water management tools, which have multiplied work efficiency. After the Jinhua Special District launched a tool reform campaign, 220 larger reservoir sites realized cart transportation, eliminating manual carrying. Lanxi County promoted 43 kinds of new-style tools, totaling more than 70,000 pieces. Thirty-three water conservancy sites realized mechanized transportation, mechanized soil compaction with rollers, and mechanized soil extraction with blasting, greatly accelerating the project progress. By the end of November, the county had completed 5.28 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, an increase of more than six times compared to the same period last year. As the earth dam of the Yankou Reservoir in Yiwu County became higher and higher, the difficulty of transporting soil to the dam also increased. After the workers came up with ideas and used their brains, they created "immortal" pulleys, rope winches, soil hoists, and other tools for going up the dam, and work efficiency rapidly improved.

In solving the materials needed for water conservancy construction, all localities have adhered to the principle of self-reliance, giving play to the role of commune-run factories, using local materials, manufacturing locally, and using locally. Jinhua Special District has established 232 factories, including tool factories, lime factories, tile pipe factories, explosive factories, and drill factories, producing a large number of water conservancy materials. Linhai County cleared out a large number of materials such as old steel plates, flat steel, angle steel, lead wire, and shovels from the warehouses of commercial and industrial departments throughout the county for use as water conservancy materials. Haiyou Commune solved more than 90% of the materials needed for water conservancy projects by clearing warehouses.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 11th—Heilongjiang Province's winter water conservancy projects have been fully launched. Local workers are braving the severe cold, expanding the canal systems of existing water conservancy projects and actively building new projects, so that water conservancy projects can be quickly completed to create good conditions for continued leaps forward in agricultural production next year.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Heilongjiang Province has built many water conservancy projects, including the canal that diverts water from the Nen River for irrigation, more than 70 medium-sized backbone projects such as medium-sized reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 500 million cubic meters, more than 6,000 small reservoirs, more than 10,000 canals, and many mechanical wells and water conservation projects, which can irrigate more than 15 million mu of paddy and dry land.

In order to further leverage the irrigation potential of these water conservancy projects, this winter, various localities have concentrated large numbers of people to expand canal systems and level land in areas where medium-sized backbone projects have already been established, so as to expand the irrigation area as much as possible. Yian County dispatched 7,000 workers to build field canals and level land around five medium-sized reservoirs, expanding the irrigation area by 150,000 mu in five days. This year, Wuchang County renovated the canals in the old irrigation area, increasing the irrigation area by more than 45,000 mu. This winter, Tangyuan County raised the dam of the Xiangzhi irrigation area by 0.5 meters, which increased the irrigation area by 20,000 mu.

The more than 70 new medium-sized backbone projects being built this winter are all located on the tributaries of the Songhua River, which are interconnected with small-scale projects, making it easier to control larger water and drought disasters. Boli County is building a reservoir on the Woken River, which will protect half of the farmland from major water and drought disasters next year. For newly built medium-sized water conservancy projects that cannot exert their full benefits next year, various localities have adopted the method of phased and phased construction, so that they can irrigate a part of the farmland and play a flood control role next year.

    规模超过往年　人力增加三倍　完工两万多处
    浙江高速度治山治水
    黑龙江积极兴建新工程扩大旧渠系
    新华社杭州11日电　浙江省水利冬修运动进入高潮。目前各地参加水利施工的劳力达到去年同期的四倍，全省已经完工的各种水利工程有二万四千八百一十一处。
    今冬浙江省水利建设的规模，超过了以往任何一年，动工的时间也比往年提早一个多月。在冬修中，各地结合当地具体情况，贯彻了蓄泄兼顾、以蓄为主，治山治水相结合、以治山为主，大中小型结合、以小型为主，灌溉发电航运相结合、以灌溉为主，群众自办和国家必要的扶助相结合、以群众自办为主，新建与维修相结合、以新建为主等一系列两条腿走路的方针。在山区、半山区大搞蓄水引水工程，向逐步建成完整的灌溉网，实现灌溉自流化进军；在平原地区，大力开展打坝并圩，整理、开辟河网，降低地下水位，发展机械排灌，实现排灌机械化，并积极发展电力灌溉。位于杭嘉湖大平原的吴兴县抽调八万多人，经过十天苦干巧干，已完成打坝并圩任务，目前正在进行渠道定线，测量放样；全长四千七百公里的干、支、毛三级渠道的开挖任务已经落实到生产小队，并已开挖渠道一百一十公里。在滨海沿江的舟山、温州等地区，正在大修海塘和江堤，提高防台抗洪能力。瑞安县三万多民工，正在东海之滨修建一条长六十公里、底宽三十米的海堤。
    为了加快施工进度，各水利工地都发动群众大搞工具改革，开展高工效竞赛。据不完全统计，全省已推广各种新式治水工具二十八万二千多件，使工效成倍地提高。金华专区开展了工具改革运动后，有二百二十处较大的水库工地实现了车子化，消灭了肩挑。兰溪县推广各种新式工具四十三种共七万多件，有三十三处水利工地实现了运输车子化、夯土滚筒化、取土爆破化，大大加快了工程进度。全县在11月底就完成土石方五百二十八万立方米，比去年同期增加六倍多。义乌县岩口水库随着土坝越做越高，运土上坝的困难也愈来愈大，经过民工们想办法动脑筋，创造了“神仙”滑轮、绳索绞盘、土卷扬机等上坝工具以后，工效迅速提高。
    各地在解决水利施工所需要的器材物料中，都根据自力更生为主的原则，发挥公社社办工厂的作用，就地取材，就地制造，就地使用。金华专区已办了工具工厂、石灰厂、瓦管厂、炸药厂、炮钎厂等工厂二百三十二个，生产了大批水利器材。临海县在全县商业、工业等部门仓库中清理出旧钢板、扁钢、角钢、铅丝、洋锹等大批物资用作水利器材。海游公社用清理仓库的办法解决了水利工程所需物资的90％以上。
    新华社哈尔滨11日电　黑龙江省水利冬修工程全面展开。各地民工正在冒着严寒，扩建现有水利工程的渠系和积极兴建新工程，使水利工程迅速成套为明年农业生产继续跃进创造良好条件。
    黑龙江省从1958年大跃进以来兴建了许多水利工程，其中包括引用嫩江水灌溉的运河，蓄水量达五亿立方米以上的中型水库等中型骨干工程七十多项，小型水库六千多个，渠道一万多条，以及许多机井、水上保持工程等，能灌溉水旱地一千五百多万亩。
    为了进一步发挥这些水利工程的灌溉潜力，今年冬季各地集中大批人马，在已经建立中型骨干工程的地区扩建渠系和平整土地，尽可能扩大灌溉面积。依安县出动七千民工在五个中型水库周围修建田间支渠和平整土地，五天就扩大了灌溉面积十五万亩。五常县今年改修老灌区渠道，增加了灌溉面积四万五千多亩。汤原县今冬将香芝灌区的拦河坝提高零点五米，就增加灌溉面积二万亩。
    今冬新建的七十多个中型骨干工程，都建在和小型工程脉搏相通的松花江的支流上，便于控制较大水旱灾害。勃利县正在倭肯河上兴建一个水库，明年可使一半农田免受较大的水旱灾害的影响。对明年不能发挥全部效益的新建中型水利工程，各地采取了分段、分期成套施工的办法，使它们在明年能灌溉一部分农田和起防洪作用。
