Open More Waterways, Build More Ships
    Guo Zhenqin, Secretary of the CPC Junxian County Committee, Henan Province

    Junxian County has mountains, rivers, and plains, abundant resources, and fertile soil. The Wei River runs diagonally through the county from southwest to northeast. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Wei River frequently breached its banks, causing floods and disasters.

    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the county basically achieved water conservancy, and industrial and agricultural production achieved tremendous development. However, the transportation industry could not adapt to the rapidly developing needs of industrial and agricultural production. In this situation, combined with the specific situation of the county's realization of water conservancy, we put forward the slogan of "the whole Party and the whole people vigorously engage in river network construction, open waterways, build wooden boats on a large scale, and vigorously develop water transport." Due to the realization of people's communes, it is easier to concentrate manpower and material resources, and water resources can be comprehensively utilized. Therefore, under the timely guidance of the higher-level Party committee, we quickly launched a mass movement of the whole Party and the whole people to open waterways and build wooden boats on a large scale throughout the county from point to area, from line to network. As of mid-October this year, the county has newly opened four major waterways, with a total length of 113 kilometers, plus the original waterways totaling 239 kilometers; developed 125 field navigable channels, with a total length of 1,350 kilometers, which are now open to traffic section by section; successively established nine shipyards, which have built 158 various types of ships, with a total carrying capacity of 2,678 tons; including tugboats, wooden boats, small river network boats for field transportation, and large sailboats carrying 300 tons of various materials. So far, all ten townships in the county have realized township-to-channel connectivity, and eight townships have access to waterways, with large and small waterways crisscrossing, thus creating a new situation of convenient water transportation in all directions.

    Due to the development of the shipping industry, the volume of material transportation has been greatly increased, and the pressure on land transportation has been reduced. According to preliminary calculations from January to October this year, the total shipping volume reached 184,334 tons, and the turnover volume reached 4.36 million ton-kilometers, ensuring the needs of Junxian County's industrial and agricultural production and the transportation of various materials such as coal for the masses and grain transportation, basically solving the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity in the county. If these materials were transported by horse-drawn carriages, it would require the full mobilization of all 5,000 horse-drawn carriages in the county, and it would take 49 days to transport them all. According to this calculation, 660,000 labor days and 926,000 animal labor days can be saved. At the same time, the people's communes received more than 20.06 million yuan in freight charges, increased public accumulation, and improved the people's lives.

    Over the past year, we have realized the benefits of developing water transport: First, the investment is small. For example, building a small boat with a load of ten tons only costs 700 yuan. After launching, the freight income for 42 days of transportation can recover the entire investment. Second, the transportation volume is large and the benefits are quick. Manufacturing a small boat with a load of ten tons only requires 180 man-days, and after launching, it is equivalent to the carrying capacity of four trucks or fourteen horse-drawn carriages. Third, the freight is low. Shipping goods costs only 3.4 cents per ton-kilometer, which is only one-twentieth of the cost of horse-drawn carriage transportation. Fourth, it can save a large number of labor, animal power, and fuel. For example, a small boat of ten tons can be pulled by two people. As the members of the Shantang Commune said after the Weidong Canal was opened to traffic:
    "The small wooden boat is really good, it doesn't burn oil or eat grass, one boat can顶十车用, saving people and animals running back and forth."

    The process of Junxian County's large-scale river network construction is a process of putting politics in command and constantly fighting against right-leaning conservative ideas that emphasize difficulties and exaggerate difficulties, as well as the mood of fear and relaxation. When the county party committee put forward the call to "open waterways, build bridges, build wooden boats on a large scale, and develop shipping and transportation," the majority of the masses actively supported it, but there were also some who doubted and opposed it. Some people with serious right-leaning sentiments believed that "this is nonsense, it is rare to sail boats in ditches," and poured cold water on it, saying: "Lack of wood, lack of iron, lack of technology, building ships on a large scale is a pipe dream." The county party committee paid special attention to strengthening ideological work, and adopted the method of "if you don't believe it, take a look, if you don't understand it, debate," and launched a large-scale airing of views and debate on shipping construction throughout the county, educating cadres and commune members, unifying ideological understanding, making the originally active people more active, dispelling the concerns of the doubters, and forcing the opponents to bow their heads and admit defeat in the face of facts.

    In order to make the mass movement of opening waterways and building ships develop smoothly, the county party committee included transportation work, especially the development of shipping, in the regular work agenda, led by the secretary, unified leadership, and carried out comprehensive planning and comprehensive utilization. In order to make shipping support industry, we planned to excavate the Changfeng and Weidong canals to connect the limestone factories on the six mountains, so that a large number of stones and lime could be promoted to various places through shipping. In the large-scale river network construction, we also planned to build 85 small hydropower stations, three of which are now generating electricity, and more than 100 water mills, producing more than 200,000 kilograms of flour per day. In terms of labor arrangement, our principle is: do a lot in slack seasons, do a little in busy seasons, prepare in summer and autumn, and launch a sudden attack in winter and spring. For example, this spring we mobilized one-third of the county's labor force, organized an army of more than 50,000 people to open waterways, and carried out a large-scale campaign for more than ten consecutive days, completing a total of 1.8 million cubic meters of earthwork, 36,000 cubic meters of stone, and building 56 bridges. The supply of raw materials is solved by using local materials and relying on our own efforts. The lack of technical personnel is solved by adopting the method of factory-led factory, teacher-led apprentice, learning while doing, and successively training 1,530 technical personnel.

    In order to adapt to the needs of the constantly leaping industrial and agricultural production, we have initially planned to open another 56 waterways and dredge 62 waterways this winter and next spring, extend the navigable channels to 1,500 kilometers, build 438 new bridge gates, build 24 docks, and build another 100 wooden boats, increasing the carrying capacity to 3,500 tons. At present, Junxian County's shipping industry is continuing to move forward. (Attached picture)

    多开航道多造船
    中共河南省浚县委员会书记　郭振勤
    浚县有山、有水、又有平原，物资丰富，土质肥沃，卫河由西南至东北斜贯全县。但是在国民党反动派统治之下，卫河经常决口，漫溢成灾。
    解放后，浚县人民在党的领导下，特别是经过1958年的大跃进，使全县基本实现了水利化，工农业生产得到了巨大的发展。可是，运输事业却不能适应工农业生产迅速发展的需要。在这种情况下，我们结合全县实现水利化的具体情况，提出了“全党全民大搞河网化，开辟航道，大造木船，大力发展水上运输”的口号。由于人民公社化的实现，使人力、物力便于集中使用，水利资源能够综合利用，因此，在上级党委的及时指导下，我们由点到面，由线到网在全县范围内迅速地掀起了全党全民大开航道、大造木船的群众运动。到今年10月中旬止，全县共新开较大航线四条，长达一百一十三公里，加上原有航道共达二百三十九公里；发展田间通航渠道一百二十五条，长达一千三百五十公里，现已节节通航；先后共建立造船厂九座，已造各种大小船只一百五十八只，载重总量达二千六百七十八吨；其中有拖轮，有木船，有田间运输的河网化小船，有运输各种物资载重三百吨的大帆船。至此，全县十个乡已实现了乡乡通渠，八乡通航，大小航线纵横交织，从而出现了水上运输四通八达的新局面。
    由于航运事业的发展，大大地提高了物资运输量，减轻了陆运压力。据今年1月至10月份的初步计算，共完成航运总量十八万四千三百三十四吨，周转量四百三十六万吨公里，保证了浚县工农业生产和群众烧煤运粮等各种物资运输的需要，基本上解决了全县运输力量不足的困难。这些物资如用马车运输，就需全县五千辆马车全部出动，运输四十九天才能运完。以此计算，可节省六十六万个劳动日，九十二万六千个畜工，同时给人民公社收入了运费二千万零六千余元，增加了公共积累，改善了人民生活。
    一年来，我们体会到发展水上运输的好处是：第一、投资小。如造一只载重十吨的小船，只需七百元的造价。下水后，搞运输四十二天的运费收入即可将全部投资收回。第二、运量大收效快。制造载重十吨的一只小船，只需一百八十个人工即可造成，下水后等于载重汽车四部，马车十四辆的载重效能。第三、运费低。船运货物一个吨公里，只需三分四厘钱的运费，只及马车运输费用的二十分之一。第四、能节省大批的劳力畜力和燃料。如一只十吨的小船二人即可拉动。正如卫东渠通航后，善堂公社社员所说的那样：
  “小小木船真正好，不烧油来不吃草，一船能顶十车用，省人省畜来回跑。”
    浚县大搞河网化的过程，是一个政治挂帅，不断同强调困难、夸大困难的右倾保守思想和畏难松劲情绪作斗争的过程。当县委提出“开挖航道，修建桥梁，大造木船，发展航运交通事业”的号召后，大多数群众是积极拥护和支持的，但也不是没人怀疑，没人反对的。一部分有严重右倾情绪的人认为“这样搞是胡闹，垅沟驶船，古今罕有”，并大泼冷水说：“缺木少铁没技术，大搞造船是空想”。县委特别注意加强思想工作，采取了不信就看，不通就辩的办法，在全县范围内展开大搞航运建设的鸣放辩论，教育了干部和社员，统一了思想认识，使原来积极的人更加积极了，怀疑的人解除了顾虑，反对的人也不得不在事实面前低头认输。
    为了使群众性的开航造船运动顺利的向前发展，县委把交通运输工作，特别是发展航运，列入了经常工作日程，由书记挂帅，统一领导，进行全面规划，综合利用。为使航运支持工业，我们有计划的开挖了长丰和卫东等渠道，沟通了六座山上的灰石厂，使大批的石头、石灰都能通过航运推销各地。在大搞河网化中，并规划建设小型发电站八十五座，现已发电的有三个，修水打磨一百多处，日产面粉二十余万斤。在劳动力的安排上，我们的原则是：农闲大干，农忙小干，夏秋准备，冬春突击。如今年春天我们动员了全县三分之一的劳力，组织了五万余人的开航大军，连续进行了十余天的大干，共完成土方一百八十万方，石方三万六千方，修桥五十六座。原材料的供应，是用就地取材自力更生的办法解决的。技术人才不足就采用了以厂带厂，以师带徒，边学边干的办法，先后培养出一千五百三十名技术人才。
    为了适应不断跃进的工农业生产的需要，我们初步计划，今冬明春再开航道五十六条，疏浚航道六十二条，把通航渠道延伸到一千五百公里，新建桥闸四百三十八座，修建码头二十四处，再造木船一百只，载重量提高到三千五百吨。目前，浚县的航运事业正在继续向前迈进。（附图片）
