    On Dreams
    Fu Lianzhang
    Everyone has dreams, but not everyone knows why they dream. Dreams are inherently illusory and absurd, with no real-world significance. However, in the past, due to the influence of religious superstition, people often regarded dreams as omens of life, and for far-fetched interpretations, there was the so-called "dream interpretation." Some rulers in the old society fantasized about having "good dreams," and some servants they kept would flatter them by "interpreting" their dreams. It is said that when An Lushan invaded Chang'an, he had a dream of having very long sleeves. He found a musician of the Tang imperial family to interpret the dream for him. This person, in order to cater to An Lushan's desire to become emperor, said that it symbolized "governing by doing nothing," and received An Lushan's reward. Later, the Tang rulers fought back into Chang'an and arrested this musician to be punished for treason. He then argued, "Interpreting the dream for An Lushan was telling a lie. In fact, dreaming of sleeves being too long meant 'unable to act freely,' destined for his failure." Emperor Xuanzong of Tang was also very happy to hear this. A dream could have such two completely opposite interpretations, showing the stupidity and ridiculousness of the feudal ruling class.
    The materialistic explanation of "dreams" has long been popular in China with the view that "one dreams at night of what one thinks about during the day." In ancient times, some people also said, "Those who sleep on thin ice dream of drowning; those who sleep on piles of firewood dream of being burned." This all illustrates that the occurrence of "dreams" is related to daily life. It is related to certain thinking activities that one usually likes or worries about, and related to the environmental conditions when falling asleep. This statement has a scientific basis, although it is not comprehensive enough.
    The development of modern physiological science has brought more understanding of dreams. Dreams are produced during sleep, but sound sleep does not produce dreams. Therefore, dreams are a product of when sleep is relatively shallow. According to Pavlov's theory, sleep is a comprehensive inhibition of the cerebral cortex and even some lower parts. If this inhibition process is very deep and thorough, human thinking activities stop, and external sound and color stimuli of general intensity cannot be perceived. This is sound sleep, and there will be no dreams at this time. If sleep is still shallow, and the inhibition process in the brain is not comprehensive and thorough, leaving some excitatory points continuing to be active, dreams will occur. The factors that cause these excitatory points to be active are mostly related to the residual effects of previously perceived stimuli, so dreams are related to daily life, not mysterious. Moreover, because most of the cerebral cortex is in an inhibited state, and these isolated excitatory points lack logical connections, this constitutes the absurdity of dreams. Pavlov said, "Dreams are the traces of various past stimuli, which are now combined in the most unexpected ways."
    Things experienced, heard, or seen in books in daily life can appear in fragments in dreams. For example, if a person has only been to Beijing and Wuhan and has never been to Shanghai, he may dream of going to Shanghai, because he has heard that Shanghai is a prosperous city, but the Shanghai in his dream is definitely not the true face of Shanghai, but only a simulation of certain scenes in Beijing and Wuhan. Certain stimuli from the internal and external environment of the body when falling asleep are also often related to dreams, such as thirst and dryness, which may cause one to dream of eating hot things, or if half of the body is exposed outside the bedding during sleep and is stimulated by the cold, one may dream of falling into a cold pool. Dreams may also be a revelation of true feelings. Individualists dream of their extravagant hopes being realized, and people who love their work dream of rising production. These can all be explained by the intricate combination of stimulus traces.
    Dreams are also related to the depth of sleep. When drowsy, the inhibition process in the cerebral cortex is also relatively shallow, and dreams are closer to real life. It is precisely "one dreams at night of what one thinks about during the day." If one thinks deeply about a math problem during the day, one may also be doing math in a dream. If one is engaged in technological innovation during the day, one may also be doing the same work in a dream. Sometimes, one may even be aware of dreaming, but cannot actively control it, and can only let it develop naturally. When sleep is slightly deeper, dreams have obvious illusiveness and absurdity, being in the east at one moment and in the west the next, or being with friends who have been dead for a long time, and one has no ability to judge or distinguish. This is because the inhibition process in the brain is deeper and more widespread.
    Sleep progresses from shallow to deep, and dreaming is a very common phenomenon. Generally speaking, it does not harm health, but if one dreams all night, and the dreams are mostly in a drowsy stage, it can affect rest, and one will feel tired during the day. In this case, one should pay attention to taking measures to deepen sleep.

    说梦
    傅连暲
    每个人都做过梦，但并不是每个人都知道为什么会做梦。梦境本来是虚幻荒诞的，没有什么现实意义。但从前由于受着宗教迷信渲染的影响，常常有人把梦境看成是生活中的一种预兆，为了牵强附会的解释，就有所谓“圆梦”。旧社会里的一些统治者，都幻想有“好梦”，也就有一些为他们豢养的奴仆们来极尽奉承的为他们“圆梦”。传说安禄山打进长安，做了一个梦，梦见袖子很长，找到唐宗室的一个乐工为他圆梦，这个人为了迎合安禄山想做皇帝的心理，就说这是象征着“垂衣而治”，获得了安禄山的封赏。后来唐代统治者又打回了长安，抓住这个乐工要治叛逆罪，他又辩解说：“为安禄山圆梦是说的假话，其实梦见袖子太长，是说明‘出手不得’，注定他要失败的。”唐玄宗听了也很高兴。一个梦竟有这样两种绝然相反的解释，足见封建统治阶级的愚蠢可笑了。
    对于“梦”的唯物主义解释，我国很早就流行有“日有所思，夜有所梦”的一种见解。古时还有人说过：“寝薄冰者，梦溺；寝积薪者，梦焚。”这都说明了“梦”的产生是与日常生活有联系的，它与自己平时喜爱的、忧虑的某些思维活动有关，与入睡时的环境条件有关，这种说法是有科学根据的，当然还不够全面。
    现代生理科学的发展，对于梦有了更多的了解。梦是在睡眠时产生的，熟睡却不会做梦，所以梦是睡眠还较浅时的产物。按照巴甫洛夫学说的理论，睡眠是大脑皮层甚至某些低位部分的一种全面性的抑制。这种抑制过程如果很深很透，人的思维活动就停止了，外在一般强度的声、色刺激也不能感知，这就是熟睡，这时也不会做梦。如果睡眠还较浅，大脑里的抑制过程还不全面彻底，剩下了某些兴奋点继续活动，梦境就要产生了。引起这些兴奋点活动的因素，大多与从前感知过的刺激的痕迹作用有关，因而梦境是与日常生活有关连的，不是神秘的。又由于大脑皮层大部分处于抑制状态，而这些孤立的兴奋点缺乏有逻辑性的联系，这就构成了梦境的荒诞性。巴甫洛夫说过：“梦就是过去各种刺激的痕迹，它们现在以最料想不到的方式组合起来。”
    日常生活中经历过的，听说过的，在书本上见到过的事，都可以片段的在梦里出现。如一个人只到过北京、武汉，没有到过上海，他做梦时也可能到了上海，因为他听说过上海是一个繁华的城市，但在他梦境里的上海绝不是真正上海市的面貌，而只是北京武汉某些情景的模拟。入睡时身体内外环境的某些刺激，与梦境也常有联系，如口渴干燥，可能梦见吃灼热的东西，又如睡眠时半身露在被褥外面，受到寒冷的刺激，可能梦见跌在冷水池里。梦境也可能是一种真情流露，个人主义者梦见了自己的奢望实现，热爱工作的人梦见生产高涨的境况。这些都可以用刺激痕迹的错综组合来解释。
    梦境与睡眠的深浅程度也有关，朦胧入睡时，大脑皮层里的抑制过程也比较浅，梦境就更加接近现实生活，正是“日有所思，夜有所梦。”日间深思一个数学题，梦里也可能在做数学，日间搞技术革新，梦里也可能搞同样的工作。甚至有时自己也觉察到在做梦，但不能主动的控制，只能听其自然发展。睡眠稍深一些，梦境则有明显的虚幻性和荒诞性，一时在东，一时在西，或者与死去已久的朋友在一起，而自己毫无判断辨别的能力。这就是因为大脑里抑制过程更深更普遍的缘故。
    睡眠是由浅入深的，做梦也是一种很普通的现象，一般说来对于健康没有什么妨害，但如果通宵做梦，而且梦境多处在一种朦胧入睡的阶段，也可以影响休息，日间也会感到疲倦，这就要注意采取加深睡眠的措施。
