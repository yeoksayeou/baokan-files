    American Capital Continues to Expand
    Dollars Flood into Malaya
    British Capital Ousted
    Kuala Lumpur Dispatch: According to newspaper reports, the First National City Bank of New York, jointly controlled by the Rockefeller and Morgan consortia, established a branch in Kuala Lumpur in early November. The manager of this branch, Schroeder, revealed on October 24 that a large amount of American capital would soon pour into Malaya.
    Locke, the Southeast Asia representative of the International Finance Corporation (affiliated with the World Bank) under American control, recently visited the Federation again. He said in Kuala Lumpur that the International Finance Corporation was prepared to invest 30 million Malayan dollars in Malaya through loans, which would be lent to private industrial and mining enterprises. One of the conditions for accepting the loan is that the International Finance Corporation will have the right to subscribe to the stocks of these enterprises in the future.
    In order to further compete for the gasoline market of the British in the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, the American Texaco Oil Company laid a 3,000-foot submarine oil pipeline on the west coast of Singapore in October, in order to directly transport gasoline from oil tankers to oil depots. Prior to this, the company had already spent 5 million Malayan dollars on building a new oil depot in Singapore to store more gasoline.
    Bimer, the general manager of Mobil Oil's Malaya branch, revealed to the press in Kuala Lumpur on the 23rd of last month that this American company was prepared to invest 92 million Malayan dollars in the Federation of Malaya. Part of this investment plan is to build an oil refinery and a chemical fertilizer plant. This is the largest single investment made by American private capital in the Federation of Malaya to date.

    美国资本不断扩张
    美元涌入马来亚
    英国资本受排斥
    吉隆坡消息：据报纸报道，由洛克菲勒和摩根两大财团共同控制的纽约第一花旗银行11月初在吉隆坡设立一家分行。这家分行的经理士柯罗德在10月24日透露，大量美国资本将于最近涌入马来亚。
    美国控制下的国际金融公司（属世界银行）东南亚区代表洛克最近又到联合邦活动。他在吉隆坡说，国际金融公司准备用贷款的方式在马来亚投资三千万元（马来亚币），这些款项将贷给私营的工矿企业。接受贷款的条件之一是国际金融公司将来有权认购这些企业的股票。
    为了进一步争夺英国在马来亚联合邦和新加坡的汽油市场，美国德士古石油公司10月间在新加坡西海岸铺设了一条三千英尺长的海底输油管，以便直接从油船上将汽油输送到油库。在这以前，这家公司已花了五百万元（马来亚币）在新加坡增建一座新的油库，以储存更多的汽油。
    美孚油公司马来亚分公司总经理比玛上月23日在吉隆坡向报界透露，这家美国公司已经准备在马来亚联合邦投资马来亚币九千二百万元。这个投资计划的一部分是用来建立一个炼油厂和一个化学肥料厂。这是到目前为止美国私人资本在马来亚联合邦投资最大的一宗。
