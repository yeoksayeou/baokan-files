    Awarding of Gold Medal to Li Siguang by Soviet Academy of Sciences for Contributions to Geology and Other Fields
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th - The Soviet Ambassador to China, Chervonenko, on behalf of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, presented the 1958 Karpinsky Gold Medal to the renowned geologist, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Vice President of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, and Foreign Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Li Siguang, in recognition of his contributions to geology, paleontology, petrology, and economic mineralogy.
    The outstanding senior Soviet geologist Karpinsky was known as the "Father of Russian Geology." He was one of the main founders of the great development of Soviet geological science and made significant contributions to the development of geological science worldwide. The Soviet Academy of Sciences specifically established the Karpinsky Gold Medal, awarded to scientists who have made important contributions to geological science.
    Ambassador Chervonenko delivered a speech at the award ceremony held at the Soviet Embassy in China tonight. On behalf of all Soviet scientific workers and the entire Soviet people, he warmly congratulated Comrade Li Siguang and all Chinese scientific workers for achieving new and greater successes under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.
    Vice President Li Siguang then delivered a speech, thanking the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for the honor bestowed upon him. He said that the awarding of this medal expresses the deep concern and great encouragement of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for Chinese scientific workers, especially Chinese geological workers. He also said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's geological undertaking, like other production and scientific undertakings, has formed a mighty Great Leap Forward situation, and has reaped an unprecedented harvest of mineral resources and extremely valuable scientific data. All these achievements are inseparable from the generous and selfless enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet government, Soviet scholars and experts, and the Chinese geological workers' learning of advanced Soviet experience and advanced technology.
    Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also spoke at the award ceremony. He said that the Soviet Academy of Sciences' awarding of the Gold Medal to Li Siguang is an encouragement to the entire Chinese scientific community. Guo Moruo expressed his hope that Chinese scientific workers would strive to learn from Soviet scientists and congratulated the further strengthening of cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientific and technological work and between scientists of the two countries.
    Also attending tonight's award ceremony were Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wu Heng, Deputy Director of the Science and Technology Commission, Zhuo Xiong, Vice Minister of Geology, as well as many experts and professors in the field of geological science in our country.

    表彰在地质学等方面的贡献
    苏科学院赠李四光金质奖章
    据新华社7日讯　苏联驻中国大使契尔沃年科今晚代表苏联科学院主席团，把1958年度的卡尔平斯基金质奖章授给著名的地质学家、中国科学院副院长、世界科学工作者协会副主席、苏联科学院国外院士李四光，表彰他在地质学、古生物学、岩石学和有用矿物学等方面作出的贡献。
    苏联杰出的前辈地质学家卡尔平斯基被誉为“俄罗斯地质之父”，他是苏联地质科学巨大发展的主要奠基人之一，并且对全世界地质科学的发展也有过重大贡献。苏联科学院专门以卡尔平斯基的名字设立金质奖章，颁发给对地质科学有重要贡献的科学家。
    契尔沃年科大使在今晚于苏联驻华大使馆举行的授奖仪式上致词，他代表苏联全体科学工作者和全体人民，热烈祝贺李四光同志和中国全体科学工作者在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，获得新的更大的成就。
    李四光副院长接着致词，感谢苏联科学院主席团给予他的荣誉。他说，这一奖章的授予，表达了苏联科学院主席团对中国科学工作者、特别是中国地质工作者的深切关怀和巨大的鼓励。他还说，自从中华人民共和国成立以后，中国的地质事业也和其他生产事业、科学事业一样，形成了声势浩大的大跃进形势，获得了空前的矿产资源和极其宝贵的科学资料的大丰收。所有这些成就，是和苏联政府、苏联学者和专家慷慨无私的热情帮助，以及中国地质工作者学习苏联先进经验和先进技术分不开的。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若也在授奖仪式上讲话。他说，苏联科学院授予李四光金质奖章，是对整个中国科学界的鼓舞。郭沫若希望中国科学工作者努力向苏联科学家学习，并且祝贺中苏两国科学技术工作和两国科学家之间的合作进一步加强。
    参加今晚授奖仪式的，还有中国科学院副院长吴有训，科学技术委员会副主任武衡，地质部副部长卓雄，以及我国地质科学方面的许多专家和教授。
