　　Vietnam's "People's Daily" Publishes Reader's Letter
　　Questioning Eisenhower's "Sincerity for Peace"
　　This newspaper reports that the December 6th international edition of Vietnam's "People's Daily" published a reader's letter signed T.L., titled "An Open Letter to U.S. President Eisenhower." The full text is translated as follows:

　　Mr. President:

　　On December 3, 1959, before you set off to visit Italy, France, India, and other countries, you announced: "The deepest wish of the United States is to build a world in which all nations can enjoy prosperity in freedom, justice, and peace without harm and without fear..." But you also lamented that in the hearts of many foreigners, "there are still many doubts about the true sincerity of the United States in seeking peace..."

　　Sir, people are truly surprised: When they hear you declare on December 2nd that "the United States needs a large number of bombers that fly faster, are more robust, and easier to operate than the current U.S. inventory of aircraft..." they cannot help but ask: Is the United States manufacturing these aircraft for peace?

　　On December 1, 1959, the U.S. Secretary of Defense announced: "By 1963, the United States will possess a large number of rockets, submarines, and other weapons capable of launching nuclear warheads to the Soviet Union. It is necessary for U.S. allies to strengthen their armaments." On the same day, one of your commanders-in-chief announced in Japan: "U.S. forces stationed in Japan already possess jet aircraft equipped with rockets." People cannot help but ask: Is all of this to prove the "true sincerity" of the United States for "peace"?

　　People also want to ask: Is the United States allocating 64% of its budget to armaments and establishing two hundred and fifty U.S. military bases abroad also for peace?

　　We, the Vietnamese people, want to ask: You provide weapons and military personnel to Ngo Dinh Diem, instigating him to sabotage the Geneva Accords and murder patriotic, peace-loving people in South Vietnam. Is this also for "freedom, justice, and peace"?

　　People also want to ask: To boost the prestige of your travels, you launched the sixth rocket to the moon before your departure. But the lunar palace did not want to receive it, and it turned its head and plunged into the sea like its five sisters. Alas, fifteen million dollars were reduced to ashes. Not only that, but it also forced U.S. scientist General Gavin to admit once again: "American rocket science is too backward. The entire United States must make a huge effort, and perhaps it will be fortunate enough to catch up with the Soviet Union within five years..."

　　Mr. President, if you want to convince people that America's "desire" is "justice" and "peace," then you should withdraw American military personnel from South Vietnam and stop instigating "Mr. Ngo" (Translator's note: referring to Ngo Dinh Diem) to sabotage the Geneva Accords and murder the people of South Vietnam. This is not a difficult thing for you to do.

　　We sincerely hope that your travels will have a better fate than your sixth rocket, and wish you "Bye-Bye!"

### 越南“人民报”刊载读者来信  质问艾森豪威尔的“和平诚意”何在

　　越南“人民报”刊载读者来信
    质问艾森豪威尔的“和平诚意”何在
    本报讯　越南“人民报”12月6日国际版刊载了一封署名T·L的读者来信，题目是“致美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封公开信”，现将全文译载如下：总统先生：
    1959年12月3日，您还未启程访问意、法、印等国之前，您曾宣布：“美国最深切的愿望就是建立一个一切国家都可以不受损害地、无所畏惧地在自由、正义和和平中享受繁荣的世界。……”但是您又叹息：在许多外国人的心里“对美国在谋求和平方面的真正诚意仍然有许多怀疑。……”
    先生，人们实在感到诧异：当人们听到您在12月2日宣称“美国需要大量的轰炸机，它们要比现在美国库存的飞机飞得更快、更结实和更易于操纵……”之后，他们不能不问：难道美国制造这些飞机是为了和平吗？
    1959年12月1日美国国防部长宣布：“到1963年，美国将拥有能够把核弹头发射到苏联去的大量火箭、潜水艇和其它武器，美国的同盟国有必要加强军备。”同一天，您的一名总司令在日本宣布：“驻日美军已经拥有用火箭装备的喷气式飞机。”人们不能不问：难道所有这一切就是为了证明美国对“和平”的“真正诚意”吗？
    人们还要问：难道美国把64％的预算用于军备方面和在国外建立二百五十个美国军事基地，这也是为了和平吗？
    我们越南人民要问：您把武器和军事人员供给吴庭艳，唆使他破坏日内瓦协议和杀害南越爱国、爱和平的人民，难道您这也是为了“自由、正义和和平”吗？
    人们还要问：为了给您的游历壮大声势，您在行前向月球发射了第六个火箭。但是月宫不想接待它，它便同它的五个姊姊一样地掉头钻到海底去了。哀哉，一千五百万美元又化为灰烬。不仅如此，它还迫使美国的科学家盖文上将再一次承认：“美国的火箭科学太落后了。整个美国要作巨大的努力，也许能够幸运地在五年内赶上苏联。……”
    总统先生，如果您要使人们相信美国的“愿望”是“正义”和“和平”的话，那么您就应该把美国的军事人员撤出南越，并停止唆使“吴志士”（译按：指吴庭艳）破坏日内瓦协议和杀害南越人民。这对您来说并不是一件困难的事情。
    我们真诚地希望您的游历将比您的第六个火箭的命运好一些，并祝您“Bye—Bye（再见）！”
