(Reported on December 30th from Taiyuan by our newspaper) The advanced experience of the Tongjialiang Store in serving industrial and mining production has blossomed and borne fruit in Shanxi Province. In the red banner emulation campaign of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing Tongjialiang by employees of the province's commercial system, the supply service work has been greatly advanced.

In less than a month since the comprehensive promotion of the Tongjialiang Store's experience, stores in industrial, mining, and forestry areas throughout the province have been doing everything possible to carry out supply work to serve production. Stores in key industrial and mining areas such as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, Taiyuan Baijiazhuang Coal Mine, Shanxi Ningwu Forestry Area, and Wenyuhe Reservoir have successively established many construction site stores, pithead restaurants, mobile supply vehicles, and supply teams, delivering goods to the front line of production in a timely manner. In order to facilitate employees, the Jiangquan District Store of Datong City established seven wellhead canteens, seventeen wellhead sewing departments, twenty-two wellhead supply teams, six underground stores, fifteen underground mobile supply teams, and sixteen after-work tuck shops. In residential areas, they have established mobile supply vehicles, mobile supply carriers, purchasing agents, sales agents, dismantling and washing groups, processing factories, and breeding farms. Recently, workers at the Taiyuan Baijiazhuang Coal Mine started mining on a mountain as high as 1,000 meters. Salespersons from the Baijiazhuang Store immediately organized a supply team of more than 100 people, delivering more than 70 kinds of goods such as fruits, cigarettes, and pastries to the mountain. In the store outlets in the residential area, in order to reassure the workers who went up the mountain to produce, they also organized a family care team to deliver tea, water, and pastries to the elderly and children day and night. In just over a month, the store received 9,049 commendations and rewards. Many stores also took the initiative to understand the commodities urgently needed by production units and actively organized supplies. After inspecting the high winds and cold conditions in the Ningwu Forestry Area, employees of the Ningwu County Store successively transported leather gloves, rubber shoes, and masks worth 50,000 yuan to the forestry area. The workers who received these wind and sand protection supplies said gratefully: "The salespersons have become our nursery workers!"

Stores in various industrial, mining, and forestry areas have also vigorously developed non-staple food bases to ensure supply. In addition to opening non-staple food processing factories for tofu, vermicelli, soy sauce, and vinegar, the Baijiazhuang Store and Qingciyao Store in Taiyuan City also grow vegetables and raise livestock together with nearby people's communes. The Yongdingzhuang Store, Fujiatan Store, and Tongjialiang Store in Datong City jointly purchased and raised 843 dairy goats, more than 1,000 piglets, more than 700 ducks, and more than 500 rabbits, striving for self-sufficiency in non-staple foods.

    同家梁商店之花
    盛开山西工矿区
    许多工矿林区水库工地
    建立各种商业供应据点
    本报太原30日电　同家梁商店为工矿生产服务的先进经验，已经在山西省开花结果。全省商业系统职工，在学同家梁、赶同家梁、超同家梁的红旗竞赛运动中，已把供应服务工作向前推进了一大步。
    在同家梁商店的经验全面推广不到一个月的时间里，全省工矿区林区的商店千方百计地开展了为生产服务的供应工作。太原钢铁公司、太原白家庄煤矿、山西宁武林区、文峪河水库等重点工矿区的商店，先后建立了许多工地商店、坑口饭店、流动供应车和供应组，及时把商品运送到生产第一线。大同市江泉区商店为了方便职工，建立了七个井口食堂、十七个井口缝纫部、二十二个井口供应组、六个井下商店、十五个井下流动供应组、十六个业余小卖部。在住宅区里，建立了流动供应车、流动供应担、代购店、代售店、拆洗小组和加工厂、饲养场等。太原白家庄煤矿职工最近在高达千米的山上开矿，白家庄商店的售货员们立即组织了一百多人的供应队伍，把水果、香烟、糕点等七十多种商品送上了山。在住宅区的商店门市部，为了让上山的工人安心生产，同时组织了家属照顾小组，日夜给老人、小孩送茶送水送糕点。一个多月里，这个商店受到表扬、奖励九千零四十九次。许多商店还主动了解生产单位急需的商品，积极组织供应。宁武县商店职工察看了宁武林区高风多冷的情况以后，先后向林区运送了价值五万元的皮手套、胶鞋、口罩。得到这些防风御沙的用品的工人，感激地说：售货员成了我们的保育员啦！
    各工矿林区商店还大力发展副食品基地，保证供应。太原市白家庄商店和青瓷窑商店除开办了豆腐、粉条、酱、醋等副食加工厂外，又和附近人民公社一起种菜、饲养牲畜。大同永定庄商店、富家滩商店、同家梁商店三家商店共购养奶羊八百四十三只、小猪一千多头、鸭七百多只、兔五百多只，争取副食品自给自足。（附图片）
