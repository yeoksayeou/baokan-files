    Kudzu has both cultivated and wild varieties. Cultivated varieties are called fen ge (粉葛) or mu ge (木葛); wild varieties are generally called wild kudzu. Wild kudzu grows rampant everywhere in the open fields.

    The growing period for kudzu is from March to November, with the best growth from March to August. Plants that have grown for two years can yield five to six catties each. Cultivated kudzu grows best in shady, moist, and fertile soil, and is not suitable for heavy clay soil with poor drainage. Cultivated kudzu yields five kilograms of root tubers per plant in the first year, and fifteen kilograms per plant in the second to third year.

    The root tubers of kudzu can be ground, the juice extracted, and kudzu powder extracted. The remaining residue can be cooked and used to feed pigs or dried for storage. The tender and withered yellow leaves of wild kudzu can both be used as fodder. (Attached picture)

    葛藤
    葛藤有栽培和野生两种。栽培的有叫粉葛，也有叫木葛；野生的一般都称野葛藤。野生葛藤在旷野上遍地乱生。
    3至11月为葛藤生长期，以3至8月生长最好。生长二年的，每株可收五至六斤。栽培葛藤，以阴湿肥沃的土地较好，排水不良的重粘土就不相宜。栽培的葛藤，一年收的，每株可收块根五公斤，二至三年收的，每株可收块根十五公斤。
    将葛藤的块根磨碎，榨出浆水，提取葛粉，剩下的渣可煮熟喂猪，或晒干贮存。野葛藤的嫩叶和枯黄的叶，都可作饲料。（附图片）
