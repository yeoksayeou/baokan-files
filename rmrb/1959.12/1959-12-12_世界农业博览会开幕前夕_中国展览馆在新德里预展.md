Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 11th: On the eve of the opening of the World Agriculture Fair in the Indian capital, the Chinese Exhibition Hall at the fair held a preview on the evening of the 10th.

More than 500 guests were invited to visit by Ji Zhaoding, head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation, including Indian members of parliament, leaders of various people's organizations, prominent social figures, government officials, experts, writers, journalists, people from all walks of life, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to India. Pan Zili, the Chinese Ambassador to India, also visited the preview.

The Chinese Exhibition Hall occupies an area of more than 70,000 square feet. The exhibits showcase the glorious achievements of China's agricultural production and construction, aquatic products, and people's commune industries during the Great Leap Forward. The first part of the exhibition hall introduces the development process of Chinese agriculture from land reform and agricultural production cooperatives to people's communes, as well as the superiority of the people's communes. It also introduces some typical people's communes, their bumper harvests, and the products they produce. The main feature of this section is the introduction of the technical measures adopted by these communes to increase production, such as deep plowing, fertilization, seed selection, and soil improvement. The guests gave these high praise, believing that they would be very beneficial in exchanging experiences with Indian farmers.

In the agricultural construction section, the guests saw various irrigation and water conservancy projects serving agriculture, as well as the processes of deep plowing and soil improvement.

In terms of agricultural tools, people saw forty kinds of giant and medium-sized agricultural machinery, including Chinese-made tractors and various types of plows. The rice transplanter was of particular interest to visitors. Many visitors said that this rice transplanter would be most attractive to Indian farmers.

Subsequently, the guests visited the industrial section of the people's commune, which displayed agricultural machinery, tools made of steel produced in small steel furnaces, radio and telephone equipment manufactured by the commune, metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, synthetic petroleum, textiles, handicrafts, and paper.

Visitors also watched with great interest forest products and models of afforestation plans, as well as animal husbandry and a large number of aquatic products.

The Hindi daily "Hindustan Daily" said in a news item today that the Chinese pavilion is very popular and that China's methods of developing agriculture and agricultural machinery are very useful to India.

Prior to this, the chairman of the World Agriculture Fair Committee, Indian Minister of Food and Agriculture Deshmukh, met with Ji Zhaoding, head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation, and Wu Zhen, deputy head of the delegation, on the 7th.

Deshmukh welcomed them. He said that the Chinese Exhibition Hall had made a contribution to the World Agriculture Fair. It was no small feat that China had built its exhibition hall in such a short period of time.
