Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21st: The Hudong Shipyard overfulfilled its state plans for total production value, total commodity value, total shipbuilding tonnage, profits delivered to the state, and costs ahead of schedule on December 18th, and the quality of its products reached the prescribed standards. Compared with last year, the total production value increased by 45.95%, the total commodity value increased by 69.47%, labor productivity increased by 32.43%, and comparable product costs decreased by 12.48%.

Constantly opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and adhering to high-speed shipbuilding are important reasons why this factory has achieved continued leaps forward this year. At the beginning of this year, the factory party committee launched mass airing of views and debates, criticizing the conservative ideas of a few cadres who advocated setting lower targets, and formulated a continued leap forward plan for this year, setting off a production upsurge. In the first half of the year, the factory's total output value increased by 1.37 times compared with the same period last year. After the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, all the factory workers were overjoyed and thoroughly criticized the right-leaning and slackening mood of a few cadres. At that time, the "Peace Sixty" ocean freighter was being built. Workers of all trades worked day and night tensely on the dock, shortening the dock cycle from the original plan of thirty days to nineteen days. Immediately afterwards, the workers shortened the dock cycle to sixteen days when building another "Peace Sixty-One" ocean freighter of the same tonnage, and the quality was better and the materials were saved even more.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21st: The Shanghai Ship Repair Yard has completed the national annual plan ahead of schedule in all aspects. The factory's state plans for total output value, product output, profits delivered to the state, and costs this year have been completed ahead of schedule recently. The product quality has improved significantly compared with last year, achieving successful sea trials for ships leaving the factory in one go, and labor productivity has increased by 21.8% compared with last year.

The reason why this shipyard was able to continue to leap forward comprehensively this year with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is that they adhered to carrying out mass movements on a large scale, adhered to the "three-way combination" of cadres, workers, and technicians, and carried out technical innovations in depth. This year, the factory party committee, based on the characteristics of the factory such as the complexity of the types of work and the large proportion of manual operation, strengthened the leadership of technical innovation, and established technical innovation core groups with workshops, work sections, and groups as units, organizing more than 300 production experts and technicians throughout the factory to carry out an increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical innovation. By December 15th, the factory had achieved a total of 2,000 major technical innovations, improved the degree of mechanization, greatly shortened the ship repair cycle, and almost all of the ships under repair were delivered ahead of schedule. Because the ship repair cycle was shortened, a cumulative total of 1.61 million operating ton-days were added to the maritime transport department this year, which is equivalent to the transport volume of a 5,000-ton ocean freighter for one year. The factory also saved 250 tons of steel and a large number of other materials. (Attached picture)

　　实现了高速度造船
    上海两个船舶厂船台、修船周期大大缩短
    新华社上海21日电　沪东造船厂在18日提前超额完成了今年的生产总值、商品总值、造船总吨位、上缴利润和成本国家计划，产品质量达到规定标准。与去年比较，生产总值增长45.95％，商品总值增长69.47％，劳动生产率提高32.43％，可比产品成本降低12.48％。
    不断反右倾、鼓干劲，坚持高速度造船，是这个厂今年实现继续跃进的重要原因。今年年初，工厂党委发动群众鸣放辩论，批判了少数干部主张把指标订得低一点等保守思想，订出了今年继续跃进计划，掀起了生产高潮，上半年全厂完成的产值比去年同期增长了一点三七倍。党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，全厂职工欢欣鼓舞，彻底批判了少数干部的右倾松劲情绪。当时正值建造“和平六十号”海轮，各工种的工人日日夜夜在船台上紧张地工作，使船台周期由原计划的三十天缩短到十九天。紧接着，职工们在建造另一艘同吨的“和平六十一号”海轮时，又将船台周期缩短到十六天，而且质量更好，用料更省。
    新华社上海21日电　上海船舶修造厂已经提前全面完成了国家年度计划。这个厂今年的总产值、产品产量、上缴利润和成本的国家计划，已经在最近提前完成，产品质量比去年有显著提高，做到出厂船只一次试航成功，劳动生产率比去年提高21.8％。
    这家船厂能够在今年多快好省地继续全面跃进，是他们坚持大搞群众运动，坚持干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”，深入开展技术革新的结果。厂党委今年根据厂里的工种复杂、手工操作比重大等特点，加强对技术革新的领导，分别以车间、工段、小组为单位，成立技术革新核心小组，把全厂的三百多个生产能手和技术人员组织起来，开展以技术革新为中心的增产节约运动。到12月15日为止，全厂共实现了二千项重大的技术革新，提高了机械化程度，使修船的周期大大缩短，承修的船舶几乎全部提前交付使用。因为缩短了修船周期，今年累计为海运部门增加了一百六十一万营运吨天，相当于一艘五千吨海轮一年的运输量。全厂还节约了二百五十吨钢材和大批其它材料。（附图片）
