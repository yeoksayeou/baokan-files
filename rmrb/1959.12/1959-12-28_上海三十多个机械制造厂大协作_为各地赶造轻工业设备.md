Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Telegram Shanghai's light industrial machinery manufacturing industry is manufacturing various mechanical equipment for the continued leap forward of light industry next year. More than thirty factories under the city's Light Industry Machinery Manufacturing Industrial Company will manufacture several thousand light industrial machines in the last half month of this year, including complete sets of papermaking machinery with a daily output of ten tons, oil pressing machinery with a daily output of one ton and three tons, and dozens of special equipment needed by the canning and other industries. Most of these products are used to equip county-run industries and commune industries.

Currently, various light industrial machinery manufacturing factories are launching a large-scale technological innovation collaboration aimed at problems in equipment, manpower, and casting supply. Some contribute manpower, some contribute machines, concentrating their efforts to rush the production of components and seizing the key to complete sets. Workers are directing the spearhead of technological innovation towards improving the processing capacity of old-fashioned small and medium-sized machine tools. On a one-ton-per-day oil press, there is a pulley with an outer diameter of 780 mm, which needs to be processed on a large lathe of more than 12 feet. The Jiangwan Machinery Factory did not have this equipment, so it used the advanced experience of "ants gnawing at bones" to process it simultaneously with two smaller lathes, solving the problem. This factory also installed two external cyclone cutting tools on a four-and-a-half-foot old-fashioned lathe, increasing efficiency by sixteen times compared to a gear lathe. This improvement alone is equivalent to adding fifteen eight-foot precision gear lathes. When the Xinghuo Machinery Factory was processing the "oil rib" components of the oil press, it added a turntable to the lathe, allowing it to function as a milling machine. The Municipal Light Industry Machinery Manufacturing Industrial Company regularly sends people to factories to check production progress, and immediately holds on-site meetings to promote any new innovations discovered. So far, the main components of these machines have been largely completed or are nearing completion. A batch of components that were only put into production in early December are also being rushed.

In April of this year, in order to meet the needs of various regions in developing small and medium-sized industries, the Shanghai industrial department established the Light Industry Machinery Manufacturing Industrial Company, in addition to some factories under the Mechanical Industry Bureau that manufacture large-scale light industrial equipment. It organized more than thirty smaller hardware handicraft production cooperatives to specialize in manufacturing various small and medium-sized equipment. In the second and third quarters, these factories had already produced more than 2,000 machines for oil and fat chemistry, food, and other factories, and also assisted the Shanghai Paper Mill in repairing many papermaking machines. The manufacturing technology of various factories has been greatly improved. For example, the Xinghuo Machinery Factory was originally a small factory that could only make simple tools and accessories, but now it can not only manufacture various food and optical glass machinery, but also manufacture precision gear lathes. The Paper Machinery Repair Factory, which used to only repair machines for more than 20 paper mills in Shanghai, has also begun to produce complete sets of papermaking machinery. Since the fourth quarter, according to the instructions of higher authorities, the company decided to change from mainly serving Shanghai locally to facing the whole country, and accepted a large number of light industrial equipment manufacturing tasks.

### 上海三十多个机械制造厂大协作  为各地赶造轻工业设备

　　上海三十多个机械制造厂大协作
    为各地赶造轻工业设备
    新华社上海电　上海轻工业机械制造业正在为明年轻工业继续跃进制造各种机械设备。市轻工业机械制造工业公司所属三十多个工厂，在今年最后半个月内，将制造出几千台轻工业机械，其中有日产十吨的全套造纸机械设备、日榨一吨和日榨三吨的榨油机械设备，以及罐头等行业所需要的几十种专用设备。这些产品大都是用来装备县办工业和公社工业的。
    目前，各轻工业机械制造厂正针对设备、人力、铸件供应等方面的问题，展开技术革新大协作，有人出人，有机器出机器，集中力量赶制部件，抓紧配套。职工们把技术革新的矛头首先指向提高老式中小机床的加工能力方面。在日榨一吨的榨油机上，有一种外径达七百八十毫米的皮带盘，需要在一丈二尺以上的大车床上加工。江湾机械厂没有这种设备，就运用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的先进经验，用两部较小的车床同时加工，解决了这个问题。这个厂还在四尺半老式车床上装上两把外旋风切削刀，效率比齿轮车床提高十六倍，这一项改进就等于增加了十五部八尺精密齿轮车床。星火机械厂在加工榨油机的“油排骨”部件时，在车床上加个转盘，使它发挥了铣床的作用。市轻工业机械制造工业公司经常派人下厂检查生产进度，一发现有新的革新，立即召开现场会议推广。到目前为止，这些机械的重要部件大致都已完成或接近完成。12月初才投料的一批部件，也正在加紧赶制。
    今年4月间，上海工业部门为了适应各地发展中小型工业的需要，在机械工业局所属的一些制造大型轻工业设备的工厂以外，又成立了轻工业机械制造工业公司，把三十多个规模较小的五金手工业生产合作社组织起来，专门制造各种中小型设备。在第二、第三季度内，这些工厂已经造出了两千多台油脂化学、食品等工厂用的机械，并且协助上海造纸厂修理了许多造纸机械。各厂的制造技术有很大提高。例如星火机械厂原来是一个只能做些简易工具和配件的小工厂，现在不但能够制造各种食品、光学玻璃机械，而且造出了精密的齿轮车床。过去只是为上海二十多家造纸厂修机器的造纸机械修配厂，也开始生产成套造纸机械。第四季度以来，这个公司根据上级的指示，决定由原来主要为上海本地服务改为面向全国，接受了大批轻工业设备的制造任务。（附图片）
