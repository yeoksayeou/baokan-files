    Turning Advanced Levels into Societal Levels
    ——Some Insights from the Hangzhou Organized Advanced Experience Promotion Group
    The Industrial Transportation Work Department of the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    With the deepening of the socialist labor competition, recently, the industrial transportation departments of Hangzhou City have adopted the form of advanced experience promotion groups to help the backward quickly catch up with the advanced, and to make the advanced even more advanced.
    The advanced experience promotion group is composed of advanced workers, leading cadres, technical personnel, and management personnel from various factories, enterprises, and trades. It adopts the method of going deep into the field, speaking from personal experience, and conducting group consultations, to exchange work experience in a planned and purposeful manner and stimulate people's desire to improve. Wherever the promotion group went, the enterprise's appearance was焕然一新 (煥然一新: completely renewed), and some key production issues were readily solved. The "learn, compare, catch up, help" labor competition flourished. As the workers praised: "The advanced experience promotion group has a noble style and new technology, achieving a double harvest of thought and production, and working together for a common leap forward."
    Achieving a "Large-Area Harvest" of the Backward Catching Up with the Advanced
    After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, like everywhere else in the country, the broad masses of cadres and workers in Hangzhou responded to the Party's call and launched a vigorous "learn, compare, catch up, help" labor competition. In the competition, more than two thousand advanced pacesetters with the characteristics of "red, diligent, and skillful" emerged in various industries in the city. Driven by the pacesetters, everyone chased after each other, striving to be the first. The advanced side went all out and strove to be even more advanced, while promoting the communist style of selflessly helping others catch up with them. The backward also worked hard, humbly learning from the advanced, and determined to catch up. Factories and factories, workshops and workshops, groups and groups, people and people, trades and trades were linked to each other, carrying out challenge matches and counterpart matches. Sending treasures and seeking experiences, coming and going. Some factories in the same industry even established mutual assistance groups by region, treating several factories as one family, discussing matters together, and supporting each other when one factory had difficulties. However, only a few units and a few workers could engage in such mutual learning and mutual assistance activities on a regular basis, and they were often limited to production technology. Therefore, it could not yet meet everyone's requirements and enable the backward to catch up with the advanced and achieve a "large-area harvest."
    In early October, the Municipal Party Committee convened a five-level cadre meeting of the industrial and transportation system. At the meeting, by opposing rightism and boosting morale, the "satisfied with being in the middle" thinking of some cadres was criticized. It was emphasized that in order to make the city's industrial production continue to leap forward, it is necessary to earnestly implement Chairman Mao's working method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, and while vigorously grasping the advanced, conscientiously carry out activities to help the advanced help the backward. The Municipal Party Committee believes that discovering the advanced and establishing advanced pacesetters is, of course, the most basic. But if the backward are not transformed and catch up with the advanced after the pacesetters are established, then the level of production cannot be further and comprehensively improved. Helping the backward catch up with the advanced not only enables the backward to quickly catch up with the advanced, but also promotes the middle-level people to catch up with the advanced and promotes the advanced people to become even more advanced.
    After the meeting, the Textile Industry Party Committee organized a working group and went deep into the most backward Tiancheng Silk Weaving Factory in the city's silk weaving industry to provide assistance. It was found that this factory had many problems in its leadership ideology and work style and production management, and many of these problems had been solved by advanced factories long ago. For example, the first-class product rate of the factory's Fuchun spinning was only about 50%. However, the Yunshang Silk Weaving Factory had a rate as high as 100%; the first-class product rate of the Happiness Silk Weaving Factory's Meili silk has always been maintained at more than 99%, but this factory had only about 60%. Therefore, taking advantage of the opportunity of the provincial model workers' conference, more than 70 advanced producers, Party committee secretaries, factory directors, and technical personnel from advanced factories such as Zhendan, Yunshang, and Dujinsheng were organized to conduct group consultations at the Tiancheng Silk Weaving Factory. As a result, 42 major key production issues were quickly identified, and medicines were immediately prescribed to the symptoms, the masses were mobilized, and three assault battles were organized to break through them one by one. In just over ten days, the long-term backwardness was quickly changed. The mixed first-class product rate of silk and satin increased from 90.81% in September to more than 99%, and the average daily output increased by 9%, becoming an advanced factory. This effective method of helping the backward catch up with the advanced caused a strong reaction in various factories, especially in backward factories. Everyone asked the representatives of the advanced factories to come and help. Through helping others, the comrades of the advanced factories also learned many useful experiences and further realized that "one person's advancement is just a single horse, and everyone's advancement can move mountains and overturn seas." Therefore, they all made guarantees and expressed that they must help everyone catch up with the advanced level. The Municipal Party Committee seized this trend in time, summarized and improved it, and believed that this practice of exchanging and promoting advanced ideas and advanced experiences in a planned, purposeful, and organized manner was a new development in the "learn, compare, catch up, help" labor competition and a concrete application of the working method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle. It can promote the overall leap in production. Therefore, this experience was immediately popularized throughout the city. Led by the responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee, the city organized three advanced experience promotion groups for industry and transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade, with a total of more than 1,500 people, and set up nine branch groups according to industries, including heavy industry, light industry, textile, transportation, construction, construction, commerce, grain, and finance. At the same time, promotion teams and promotion groups were also established within enterprises to launch mass promotion activities throughout the city.
    Comprehensive Promotion, Comprehensive Improvement
    The advanced experience promotion group is a promotion group to promote the overall leap in production. The reason why it is said this is because it implements comprehensive promotion of ideology, production, leadership style, and leadership methods, especially insisting on putting politics in command and carrying out ideological assistance first, so that it grasps the key and promotes various tasks of the enterprise. In the past, we also organized inspection groups and observation groups, but they generally focused on production technology and rarely carried out ideological struggles. Therefore, technical problems were often solved, but ideological problems were not solved, and as a result, production still could not leap forward. This time, the activities of the promotion group were completely opposite. For example, when they arrived at the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, they found that some cadres in the factory emphasized that the reason why their factory's production was backward was due to the "poor" objective conditions, the complexity of the fabrics, the frequent machine modifications, and the difficulty of making varieties. Therefore, they were at ease with being backward. At this time, the promotion group made criticisms both sincerely and seriously; at the same time, it also organized advanced workers in the factory to perform operations. The leadership style was changed, and advanced experience was spread, quickly increasing the first-class product rate of silk and satin from 95.49% in October to 99.75%.
    Finding Advanced Factors within the Enterprise
    Secondly, the working method of the advanced experience promotion group is mainly to rely on and mobilize the masses to carry out activities. They follow the principle that internal causes are the decisive factor and external causes can only play a certain promoting role. After going down, they first actively explore the positive factors within each enterprise, vigorously summarize and promote various advanced things in the enterprise itself, and, in response to the problems existing in the enterprise, mobilize the masses to speak out freely. In this way, the internal causes and external causes are closely combined, truly playing the role of the promotion group. The activities of the promotion group in a unit mainly adopt the method of "one listen, two check, three plan, and four help." Listen, that is, after the promotion group goes to the factory, first listen to the report of the enterprise's leading cadres on the current production situation, and hold various types of symposiums with workers and department cadres to listen to their opinions on production and management, and understand the basic situation of the enterprise, so as to find problems from it. Check, that is, together with the enterprise's leading cadres and employees, go deep into the field, and adopt various forms such as "three combinations" and "one dragon" to find out the key to production. Plan, that is, analyze and study the problems and reasons found, propose improvement methods, and reach a consensus. Help, that is, after everyone's understanding is unified, the promotion group helps the promoted unit formulate a plan and encircle the key points. In view of the fact that the production management of some backward units is quite chaotic and there are piles of problems, it is impossible to solve them all at once. Therefore, the promotion group also distinguishes between priorities and urgencies, grasps the key points, and helps enterprises break through key production issues in a planned and purposeful manner, so as to avoid complicated clues, scattered forces, and failure to achieve the due effect.
    The Promotion Group has both Production Experts and Leading Cadres
    Thirdly, the advanced experience promotion group has a complete set of people. There are not only production experts from various trades and a large number of technical personnel; but also experienced party and government leading cadres and management cadres. In this way, it is convenient to check and help counterpart, quickly and timely discover problems, and solve them. Especially for those products with relatively complex technology, and newly built factories with relatively poor management foundation and lack of leadership experience, the collaborative research of the promotion group and the cadres and employees of the factory can greatly shorten the groping process, greatly enhance the confidence in overcoming difficulties, and accelerate the solution of key production problems.
    The advanced experience promotion group is not only applicable to enterprises with the same industry, but also applicable to "exclusive factories." Because although an exclusive factory is "the only one" in a region, it is not exclusive from the large scope of the city, province, and country. At the same time, there are also advanced and backward differences within the "exclusive factory". How to make the backward quickly catch up with the advanced, and the advanced even more advanced, it is completely necessary to promote. Of course, "exclusive factories" have their different characteristics. Therefore, we also have some differences in specific practices. The first is to "send out" to "learn" from advanced factories in other places; the second is to "invite in" and invite advanced factories from other places to promote in the factory; the third is to organize promotion teams and groups within the factory, and various workshops and work sections promote each other, extensively organizing advanced help the backward, and the backward catch up with the advanced, which also achieves the purpose of promotion. Therefore, some people think that the production situation of "exclusive factories" is different from others, and the form of the promotion group is not applicable, which is not correct.
    Since the advanced experience promotion group launched activities in Hangzhou City, although it has only been more than ten days, it has achieved remarkable results. Of the eleven factories in the city with relatively backward production, seven have gotten rid of their backward appearance after being helped by the promotion group, and the remaining four have made varying degrees of progress in production. At the same time, it also prompted the advanced to be more advanced. For example, the first-class product rate of silk and satin was only 97% in October, and it has reached 99.76% in mid-November, with batches of factories with 100% quality appearing. Under the promotion of the promotion group, the quality of castings in the city's machinery industry rose sharply in mid-November, the scrap rate dropped from 6.64% in October to about 3.68%, and the finished product rate increased from 68.85% in October to 71.9%, creating the highest record since this year.
  Through the activities of the promotion group, cadres have also been further trained and the leadership level and management level of enterprises have been improved. Cadres at all levels have further learned a complete set of working methods such as grasping both ends, bringing along the middle, and conducting thorough and detailed investigations and researches. The promotion group also helped various units to summarize various advanced seedlings, study them, incorporate them into rules and regulations, and improve enterprise management.

    把先进水平变为社会的水平
    ——杭州组织先进经验促进团的几点体会
    中共杭州市委工业交通工作部
    随着社会主义劳动竞赛的深入开展，最近，杭州市工业交通运输部门曾采用先进经验促进团的形式，帮助落后迅速赶上先进，并使先进的更先进。
    先进经验促进团是由各工厂企业各工种的先进工人、领导干部和技术人员、管理人员等一整套人马组成，采取深入现场、现身说法、群医会诊的方法，有计划、有目的地交流工作经验，激发人们的上进心。凡是促进团到过的单位，几天之内，企业面貌焕然一新，一些生产关键迎刃而解，“学、比、赶、帮”劳动竞赛蓬勃开展。正如工人们所赞扬的：“先进经验促进团，风格高尚技术新，思想生产双丰收，齐心合力同跃进”。
    来个落后赶先进的“大面积丰收”
    党的八中全会以后，和全国各地一样，杭州市广大干部和职工群众，纷纷响应党的号召，掀起了轰轰烈烈的“学、比、赶、帮”的劳动竞赛。在竞赛中，全市各行各业涌现出二千多个具有“红、勤、巧”特点的先进标兵。在标兵的带动下，你追我赶，人人争先。先进的一面鼓足干劲，力争更加先进，一面发扬共产主义风格，无私地帮助别人赶上自己；落后的也奋发图强，虚心学习先进，立志赶上先进。工厂与工厂、车间与车间、组与组、人与人、工种与工种相互挂钩，开展对手赛、对口赛。送宝取经，你来我往。有些同行业的工厂，还按地区分片成立互助组，做到数厂如一家，有事共商量，一厂有困难，大家来支援。但是，这种互相学习、互相帮助的活动，能够做到经常的只有少数单位和少数工人，而且往往局限于生产技术方面。因此，还不能满足大家的要求，使落后赶先进的活动获得“大面积丰收”。
    10月初，市委召开了工业交通系统的五级干部会议。会上，通过反右倾，鼓干劲，批判了部分干部“安于中游”思想。强调指出，要使本市工业生产继续跃进，必须切实贯彻毛主席抓两头、带中间的工作方法，在大抓先进的同时，认真开展先进帮落后的活动。市委认为：发现先进，树立先进标兵，当然是最基本的。但在树立标兵以后，如果不使落后转变，赶上先进，那末，就不能进一步、全面提高生产水平。帮助落后赶先进，不但使落后迅速赶上先进，并且可以推动中间状态的人赶上先进，推动先进的人更加先进。
    会议以后，纺织工业党委组织了工作组，深入到全市丝织工业最落后的天成丝织厂去进行帮助。发现这个厂在领导思想作风和生产管理上存在着许多问题，而这些问题有许多是先进厂早就解决了的。如该厂的富春纺正品率只有50％左右。而云裳丝织厂却高达100％；幸福丝织厂的美丽绸正品率一直保持在99％以上，而该厂却只有60％左右。于是就趁全省召开群英大会的机会，组织了震旦、云裳、都锦生等先进厂的先进生产者和党委书记、厂长、技职人员七十多人，到天成丝织厂群医会诊，结果很快就找出了生产上的四十二个主要关键，马上对症下药，发动群众，组织了三次突击战，逐个突破，在短短的十多天时间内迅速改变了长期落后面貌。绸缎混合正品率从9月份的90.81％提高到99％以上，平均日产量增加了9％，一跃而为先进厂。这种帮助落后赶上先进的有效方法，在各厂特别是落后厂引起了强烈的反应。大家纷纷要求先进厂的代表去帮助。先进厂的同志通过帮助别人，也学到了许多有益的经验，进一步认识到“一人先进只是单枪匹马，众人先进才能移山倒海”。因此纷纷提保证，表示一定要帮助大家赶上先进水平。市委及时抓住了这个苗头，进行总结提高，认为这样有计划、有目的、有组织地交流推广先进思想和先进经验的做法，是“学、比、赶、帮”劳动竞赛的新发展，是抓两头、带中间工作方法的具体运用，它能促使整个生产飞跃发展。因此，立即在全市普遍推广了这个经验。由市委负责同志带领，全市组织了工业交通、基建、财贸三个先进经验促进团共一千五百多人，并按产业下设重工、轻工、纺织、交通、建筑、建设、商业、粮食、财政金融等九个分团。同时在企业内部也分别成立了促进队、促进组，在全市范围内展开群众性的促进活动。
    全面促进　全面提高
    先进经验促进团是推动生产全面跃进的促进团，所以这样说，是因为它实行思想、生产、领导作风、领导方法的全面促进，特别是首先坚持政治挂帅，进行思想帮助，这样就抓住了关键，推动了企业的各项工作。过去我们也组织过检查团、观摩团，但是一般偏重于生产技术方面，很少开展思想斗争。所以往往技术问题解决了，而思想问题未解决，结果生产仍然跃不上去。这次促进团的活动完全相反。例如他们到了美亚丝织厂，发现该厂部分干部强调自己厂生产所以落后，是由于客观条件“差”，织物复杂，改机多，品种难做，因此对落后心安理得，这时，促进团就既诚恳又严肃地提出批评；同时，还组织厂内先进工人进行操作表演。领导作风转变了，先进经验传播了，很快使绸缎正品率从10月份的95.49％提高到99.75％。
    找企业内部的先进因素
    其次，先进经验促进团的工作方法，主要是依靠和发动群众进行活动，他们遵循着内因是决定因素，外因只能起到一定的促进作用的原则，下去后，首先是积极发掘各个企业内部的积极因素，大力总结推广企业本身各种先进的东西，并针对企业中存在的问题，发动群众大鸣大放。这样，就把内因和外因密切结合起来，真正起到促进团的作用。促进团在一个单位中的活动，主要是采取“一听、二查、三谋、四帮”的方法。听，就是促进团下厂后，首先听取企业领导干部对当前生产情况的汇报，召开工人、课室干部等各种类型的座谈会，听取他们对生产和管理方面的意见，了解企业的基本情况，从中发现问题。查，就是会同企业领导干部和职工群众，深入现场，采取“三结合”、“一条龙”等多种形式，找出生产上的关键所在。谋，就是把查出来的问题和原因进行分析、研究，提出改进办法，取得一致意见。帮，就是当大家认识统一后，促进团就帮助被促进单位制订计划，围攻关键。鉴于有些落后单位生产管理相当混乱，问题成堆，不可能一下子全部解决。所以，促进团还分别轻重缓急，抓重点，帮助企业有计划、有目的地突破生产关键，以免头绪纷繁，力量分散，收不到应有的效果。
    促进团既有生产能手又有领导干部
    第三，先进经验促进团有一整套人马。既有各工种生产能手和大批技术人员；又有经验丰富的党政领导干部和管理干部。这样就便于对口查、对口帮，迅速、及时地发现问题，加以解决。特别是对那些技术比较复杂的产品，和管理基础比较差、领导经验缺少的新建工厂，通过促进团和本厂干部与职工的协作研究，就可以大大缩短摸索过程，大大增强克服困难的信心，加速生产关键问题的解决。
    先进经验促进团不仅适用于有同行业的企业，而且也适用于“独家厂”。因为独家厂虽然在一个地区来说是“只此一家”，可是从全市、全省、全国大范围说，就不是独家了。同时，“独家厂”内部也存在着先进和落后的差异，如何使落后迅速赶上先进，先进的更加先进，也完全有促进的必要。当然，“独家厂”有它不同的特点。因此，我们在具体的作法上也有所不同。一是“派出去”，到外地先进厂去“取经”；二是“请进来”，邀请外地先进厂来厂促进；三是厂内组织促进队、组，各车间、各工段相互促进，广泛组织先进帮落后，落后赶先进，这就同样达到了促进的目的。因此，有人认为“独家厂”生产情况和别人不同，促进团这种形式不适用，这是不对的。
    先进经验促进团在杭州市开展活动以来，虽然不过十多天的时间，已经取得了显著的成绩。全市原有十一家生产比较落后的工厂，经过促进团帮助，其中有七家摆脱了落后面貌，其余四家生产均有不同程度的进步。同时也促使先进更先进。如10月份绸缎正品率只有97％，11月中旬已达到99.76％，出现了成批质量100％的工厂。全市机械工业在促进团的推动下，11月中旬的铸件质量直线上升，废品率由10月份的6.64％下降到3.68％左右，成品率由10月份的68.85％提高到71.9％，创造了今年以来的最高纪录。
  通过促进团的活动，也进一步培养了干部，提高了企业领导水平和管理水平。各级干部进一步学会了抓两头、带中间，深入细致地进行调查研究等一整套工作方法。促进团还帮助各单位把各种先进苗头，加以汇总，经过研究，纳入规章制度，改进企业管理工作。
