	New Civil Aviation Route Added to the Grasslands
	A green, domestically-produced An-2 aircraft recently took off from Hohhot, passed through Baotou, and arrived at Dongsheng County, the seat of the People's Committee of the Ikzhao League on the Ordos Grassland. This is the third local civil aviation route newly opened by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region this year.
	The Ordos Grassland is one of the main animal husbandry bases in Inner Mongolia. However, in winter and spring, the Yellow River freezes, making transportation very inconvenient. The opening of this route will promote the development of production and economic prosperity.

    草原又添民航线
    一架绿色的国产安二型飞机，最近从呼和浩特市起飞，经过包头，到达鄂尔多斯草原上伊克昭盟人民委员会所在地东胜县。这是内蒙古自治区今年新辟的第三条地方民航线。
    鄂尔多斯草原是内蒙古的主要畜牧业基地之一。但是冬春季节黄河封冻，交通十分不便，这条航线的开辟，对发展生产和繁荣经济，将起促进作用。
