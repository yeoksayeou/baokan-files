A young man leads a steed, walking by the clear stream.
In the water reflects a ball of fire, upon the fire sits a mountain.
The fire is the steed's reflection, the mountain is the army's wounded soldier.
Sweet wine, precious sword, Flame Steed, the Tibetan people cherish it like life itself.
Bandits snatched the horse away, the army seized the horse back.
A soldier was wounded seizing the horse, the young man sent him hurrying to the team.
The grassland is like a sea, the wind stirs up waves,
The reins are the rudder, the Flame Steed is the boat,
The young man steers, carrying his benefactor,
Riding the wind and waves, the boat does not sway.
Da-da-da arrives at the horse station,
New horses are already prepared with saddles.
Army! I wish the horse station would not change horses,
To accompany you all the way to the camp.

A girl leads a steed, walking by the willow forest.
The steed is adorned with red and green, the steed is covered in wildflowers.
The wounded soldier is steady and secure in the saddle,
Just like sleeping on a warm bed.
The girl cracks her colorful whip, the silver bell jingles:
In the past I feared hearing the horse bell,
Each sound tugged at my heart,
My brother was driven from the village by the chieftain,
Five springs have passed without returning home.
Suddenly, the magpie called yesterday,
The wandering son has returned to the village!
A dappled horse, carries the bridegroom,
Liberated serfs become a couple.
My brother was saved by the army,
Flowers cannot bloom without rain!
The wedding flower horse is sent to the army,
The horse leader is the new bride.
Army! Even if I see you off for ten thousand miles,
It is not enough to repay your kindness.

An old man leads a steed, appearing at the snowy mountain peak.
It is like a white dragon descending from the heavens,
The dragon carries a golden-armored god.
The steed is originally a white dragon horse,
How can a god compare to our great army?
The old man gives the wounded soldier sweet milk tea,
The old man gives the wounded soldier a leather vest:
I have been herding horses for half my life,
I don't even own a single strand of horse mane,
On snowy nights, going to perform corvée labor,
My left leg was broken from walking!
The Bodhisattva has never opened his eyes,
But I, an old man, have had good fortune:
The army helped me gain liberation,
No longer forced to perform corvée labor and run for my life,
Giving me this white dragon horse,
Like a tiger with wings, able to soar into the clouds!
Army! Even if I give you the snowy mountain, it would become small,
I can walk three days' journey in one day!
After speaking, the steed neighed,
Recalling the past when it was trapped in the enemy's formation,
Its iron hooves still seem to trample the bandits,
As if it wants to, once again, perform meritorious service for the snowy mountain!

Station after station, thousands and ten thousands of villages,
Every village has someone leading a horse,
Every station already has a horse waiting.
Snowy mountains and icy rivers are not difficult,
The Party has taken root on the plateau!

    三匹骏马
  　张永枚一青年牵骏马，走过清溪畔。水里映出一团火，火上坐着一架山。火是骏马的影子，山是大军的伤员。甜酒宝刀火焰驹，藏胞爱它命一般。叛匪把马抢了去，大军把马夺回还。战士夺马受了伤，青年送他把队赶。草原似大海，风吹起波澜，马缰绳是舵，火焰驹是船，青年掌舵载恩人，乘风破浪船不颠。的的打打到马站，已有新马备了鞍。大军啊！我愿马站不换马，一直陪你到营盘。二姑娘牵骏马，走过柳林旁。骏马披红又挂绿，骏马一身野花香。伤员在鞍上平又稳，恰似睡在暖床上。姑娘扬彩鞭，银铃叮叮当：从前我怕听马铃声，声声牵动我的肠，阿哥被头人赶出村，五个春天不回乡。忽然前天喜鹊叫，流浪的人儿回村庄！五花马，驮新郎，翻身的农奴结成双。阿哥是大军给打救，花无雨水不开放！结婚的花马送大军，牵马人是新嫁娘。大军啊！纵然相送十万里，不及你的恩情长。三老汉牵骏马，出现雪山顶。好似白龙下天来，龙上驮的金甲神。骏马本是白龙马，神将怎比我大军？老汉给伤员甜奶茶，老汉给伤员皮背心：我牧马半辈子，马鬃没一根，风雪夜，去支差，左脚走的断了筋！菩萨从来不开眼，老汉倒是走了运：大军帮我得解放，不再支差去奔命，送我这匹白龙马，虎生翅膀能腾云！大军啊！送你雪山也变小，我一日能走三日程！说完骏马一声嘶，忆起往日陷敌阵，铁蹄犹似踏贼匪，好像要，再为雪山立功勋！一站一站，千村万村，村村都有人牵马，站站早有马在等。雪山冰河不算难，党在高原生了根！
