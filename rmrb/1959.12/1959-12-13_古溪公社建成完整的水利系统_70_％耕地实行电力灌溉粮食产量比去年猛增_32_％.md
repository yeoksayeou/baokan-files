Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 12th: The Guxi Commune in Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, has basically achieved high-standard river network development and irrigation electrification within one year of its establishment. Now, the newly opened river ports and channels in the entire commune crisscross, and the originally scattered land is now leveled into square fields. River water, after passing through electric irrigation stations, flows continuously into the fields along channels of all sizes. In the rivers, flocks of ducks swim around, and plump carp occasionally leap out of the water. The entire countryside is so vibrant and thriving.

This new water town was born after the people's commune was established. In just eight months, the 23 brigades in the entire commune opened two major trunk rivers, seven medium-sized ditches 40 meters wide, 6 meters deep, and over 2,000 meters long, and 63 production ditches 12 meters wide, 2 meters deep, and over 1,000 meters long. There is a production ditch every 200 meters and a medium-sized ditch every 1,000 meters. Production ditches connect to medium-sized ditches, medium-sized ditches connect to trunk rivers, and trunk rivers connect to the Yangtze River, forming a complete water system. If these ditches and rivers were connected, they would be 180 li long in total. While repairing the rivers, the entire commune also built four new electric irrigation stations, installed eight electric motors with a total of 440 kilowatts, and excavated 160 main, branch, and distribution canals for electric irrigation, enabling 70% of the commune's farmland to be irrigated by electricity. These projects involved a total of more than 2.7 million cubic meters of earthwork, which is more than three and a half times the total amount of earthwork done in the nine years before communization.

This summer, the commune encountered a severe drought, the worst in 30 years, with no rain for more than 50 days. However, the water in the rivers was still full, and every mu of paddy field was not short of water, and every plot of drought-resistant grain was not affected by drought. At the same time, the implementation of electric irrigation freed up a large number of laborers to strengthen fertilizer accumulation, application, and field management. The average yield per unit area of 17,800 mu of "three wheats" in the entire commune increased by 30% compared to 1958, and the yield per unit area of 10,300 mu of rice reached 550 jin, an increase of 36% compared to 1958. Other crops such as corn, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and carrots also achieved bumper harvests. The total grain output of the entire commune increased by 32% compared to 1958, transforming it from a grain-deficient commune to a grain-surplus commune. Last year, the commune relied on state supply of 1.14 million jin of food grain; this year, in addition to retaining sufficient food grain, seeds, and feed, it has already sold 2.3 million jin of surplus grain.

After communization, not only did grain production increase, but also animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries developed greatly. Before liberation, Guxi Commune was a drought-resistant grain area with poor water conservancy conditions, barren soil, and a very poor people's life. At that time, half of the cultivated land was subject to "heavy floods with heavy rain, minor floods with light rain, and drought without rain," and 40% of the cultivated land was sandy soil and saline-alkali soil. Cultivation was extensive, and the annual yield per mu was only over 100 jin. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, water conservancy was actively constructed and agricultural production was vigorously developed, and agricultural output increased year by year. In 1958, the average yield per mu of grain crops in the entire commune reached 470 jin, an increase of 25.6% compared to 1957 and 1.8 times that before liberation. In the construction of water conservancy, although the strength of the advanced cooperatives was much greater than that of individual households, mutual aid groups, and elementary cooperatives, due to the small number of households and limited scope of the advanced cooperatives, their strength was limited, and they still could not fundamentally eliminate drought and flood disasters.

In order to completely get rid of poverty, after the establishment of the commune, it made full use of the superiority of "large scale and high degree of public ownership," broke the various restrictions of decentralized management of agricultural cooperatives, and uniformly planned the land and arranged labor according to the principle of equal exchange, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit. It solved the land use problem of opening rivers and large channels that could not be solved in the past. At the same time, by running public welfare undertakings such as canteens and nurseries, it freed 95% of the female labor force in the entire commune from busy housework, making them a vital force in water conservancy construction and agricultural production.

In the construction of the river network project, all production brigades in the entire commune carried out large-scale labor cooperation, accelerating the progress of the project. For example, the nine brigades of Changqiao, Tongxin, Wangrui, and Guzhuang, which were responsible for building the first phase of the project, had to excavate two large rivers, four medium-sized ditches, 29 production ditches, and 54 electric irrigation canals, totaling 1.5 million cubic meters of earthwork. However, these nine brigades had only more than 3,000 laborers, and even if all of them went to the construction site, it would take a year to complete. In view of this situation, the commune Party committee mobilized 3,500 laborers from the 14 brigades that started work later to cooperate, so that these projects were completed from the start of construction in September 1958 to January 1959. Then, these brigades also transferred 1,800 laborers to support the 11 brigades of Duanzhuang, Yawan, and Hongqi in completing the construction of 106 irrigation canals on schedule, while ensuring the irrigation water for the conversion of dry land to paddy fields throughout the commune. During the water conservancy construction movement, the entire commune also transferred 164 carpenters and skilled farmers to organize tool reform commando teams to vigorously promote cartization and winchization, so that the work efficiency of the migrant workers on the entire construction site increased from the original two cubic meters of earthwork per person per day to four to five cubic meters.

The funds and equipment required for the entire commune to achieve electric irrigation were, in addition to state support, all solved by the commune and production teams themselves. The three brigades that did not benefit also provided support, thereby solving all the problems of funds, equipment, and raw materials.

The Guxi People's Commune was able to build a large-scale water conservancy project in eight months and achieved fruitful results in the Great Leap Forward. The commune members deeply experienced that without communization, there would be no river network development and electric irrigation; with the people's commune, they could jump higher and fly farther. They said with emotion: "The commune is a union of thousands of households, a union of all good things."

    古溪公社建成完整的水利系统
    70％耕地实行电力灌溉粮食产量比去年猛增32％
    据新华社南京12日电　江苏省泰兴县古溪公社在成立后一年的时间里，基本上实现了高标准的河网化和灌溉电力化。现在，全社新开的河港渠道纵横交错，原来分散的土地现在平整成一块块方正的园田。河水经过电力灌溉站，源源不断地沿着大大小小的渠道流进田间。河道里，成群的鸭子游来游去，肥嫩的鲤鱼不时跃出水面。整个农村是这么生气勃勃，欣欣向荣。
    这个新水乡，是在人民公社化以后诞生的。在短短八个月时间内，全公社二十三个大队一共新开了两条大干河，七条面宽四十米、底深六米、长达二千多米的中沟，以及六十三条面宽十二米、底深二米、长达一千米的生产沟。每隔二百米有一条生产沟，每隔一千米有一条中沟。生产沟接中沟，中沟连干河，干河通长江，构成了一个完整的水系。如果把这些沟河连接起来，共有一百八十华里长。在修河的同时，全社还新建了四个电力灌溉站，安装了八台电动机，共四百四十瓩，开挖电力灌溉的干、支、斗渠一百六十条，使全社70％的耕地实行了电力灌溉。这些工程，共做了二百七十多万立方米土方，比公社化前九年所做的土方总数还要多三倍半。
    今年夏季，公社遇到了三十年来未有的大旱，持续五十多天没有下雨，但河道里的水还是满满的，稻田亩亩不脱水，旱谷块块不受旱。同时，实行了电力灌溉以后，腾出了大批劳动力加强积肥施肥和田间管理工作，全社一万七千八百亩“三麦”的平均单位面积产量比1958年增产30％，一万零三百亩水稻的单位面积产量达到五百五十斤，比1958年增加36％。其他玉米、花生、山芋、胡萝卜等作物也得到丰收。全社粮食总产量比1958年增加32％，由缺粮社一跃而为余粮社。去年全社还依靠国家供应了一百十四万斤口粮，今年除了留足口粮、种子、饲料以外，已出卖余粮二百三十万斤。
    公社化后不仅粮食增产，牧业、副业和渔业也都得到了很大发展。古溪公社解放前是一个水利条件很坏、土瘠地薄、人民生活十分贫困的旱谷地区。那时候，有一半耕地是“大雨大涝，小雨小涝，无雨就旱”，40％的耕地是飞沙土和盐碱土，耕作粗放，每亩常年产量只有一百多斤。解放以后，在党的正确领导下积极兴修水利，大力发展农业生产，农业产量逐年提高。1958年全社每亩粮食作物的平均产量达到四百七十斤，比1957年增加25.6％，比解放前增加一点八倍。在兴修水利中，虽然高级社的力量比单干、互助组和初级社大得多了，但是，由于高级社户数少、范围小，力量有限，仍不能从根本上解除旱涝灾害。
    为了彻底摆脱穷困，公社成立以后，充分运用“一大二公”的优越性，打破了农业社分散经营时的种种限制，并根据等价交换互助互利的原则，统一规划了土地和安排了劳动力，解决了过去无法解决的开挖河流、大渠道的用地问题，同时又通过兴办食堂、托儿所等公共福利事业，使全社95％的妇女劳动力从繁忙的家务劳动中解放出来，成为水利建设和农业生产的一支生力军。
    在修建河网化工程中，全公社各个生产大队开展了劳力大协作，加快了工程进度。例如，负责兴建第一期工程的常桥、同心、王瑞、顾庄等九个大队要开挖两条大河，四条中沟，二十九条生产沟，以及五十四条电力灌溉渠，共要做一百五十万立方米土方。但是，这九个大队只有三千多个劳动力，就是全部上工地也需要一年才能完成。根据这种情况，公社党委就从晚开工的十四个大队动员了三千五百个劳动力来协作，使这些工程从1958年9月开工到1959年1月就完工了。接着，这几个大队也抽调了一千八百名劳力，支援段庄、鸭湾、红旗等十一个大队如期完成了一百零六条灌溉渠的修建任务，同时保证了全社旱地改种水稻的灌溉用水。在水利建设运动中，全公社还抽调了一百六十四个木匠和有技术的农民，组织工具改革突击队大搞车子化、绞关化，使整个工地民工的工效由原来的每人每天两立方米土方提高到四立方米到五立方米。
    全公社实现电力灌溉所需要的资金和器材，除了国家支持以外，其余都依靠公社和生产队自己解决。非受益的三个大队也进行了支援，从而解决了全部资金、器材、原料问题。
    古溪人民公社能在八个月的时间内，修成了规模巨大的水利工程，结出了大跃进的丰硕果实，社员们深刻体验到：没有公社化，就没有河网化和电力灌溉；有了人民公社，就跳得高，飞得远。他们感动地说：“公社是千家万家合一家，千好万好合一好。”
