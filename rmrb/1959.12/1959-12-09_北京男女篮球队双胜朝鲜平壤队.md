Xinhua News Agency, December 8th -- In friendly matches held tonight at the Beijing Gymnasium, the fast-moving Beijing men's and women's basketball teams both defeated the Pyongyang City men's and women's basketball teams from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The score for the women's team was 68 to 51; for the men's team, it was 100 to 50.

	The Pyongyang women's team again used a full-court press, man-to-man defense tonight. Based on this situation, the Beijing team passed the ball more to center Yang Jie, who is 1.76 meters tall, allowing her to score under the basket. On the other hand, the agile Ma Shenmei, Hu Yingxin, and Li Shaofen and others cut in for layups or shot from the outside, maintaining a lead in the score. At the end of the first half, the visiting team was 11 points behind at 21 to 32.

	In the second half, the visiting team also replaced their tallest player (1.72 meters) Zhao Renhua (No. 8) in the center position. She and forward Kim Ki-ok (No. 5) were very active under the basket. When the Beijing team paid attention to defending Zhao Renhua, Kim Ki-ok shot from the outside. In less than two minutes, they scored eight points together, narrowing the gap to 29 to 32. After the home team took a timeout, they also started using a tight man-to-man defense, reducing the opponent's shooting opportunities. At the same time, they launched fast breaks as soon as they intercepted the ball, which gradually widened the score. Yang Jie and Li Shaofen performed excellently tonight, scoring a total of 41 points together.

	At the beginning of the men's game, the Beijing team launched a rapid offensive. The quick runs, the skillful cooperation of Yang Boyong and Qian Chenghai, and the accurate shots repeatedly won the cheers of the audience. Of the 46 points scored by the Beijing team in the first half, 30 points were scored by these two players.

	Zhang Heyang (No. 6), the shortest player (1.70 meters) on the Pyongyang men's team, was exceptionally agile. He often used changing directions of layup techniques to break through the Beijing team's layers of defense to score. In the first half, he and Jiang Xiong (No. 9), the team's 1.87-meter center, scored a total of 18 points, accounting for two-thirds of the team's first-half score (27 points).

	In the second half, the Beijing team took advantage of their height advantage and played a "double center" offensive tactic and a man-to-man defense tactic for most of the time. Ju Fen Kang, who is 1.98 meters tall, and Wang Lifa, who is 1.90 meters tall, repeatedly scored under the basket, putting the opponent at a disadvantage.

	After the friendly matches, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi met with the athletes of both sides on the sports field and took photos with them. (Attached picture)

    北京男女篮球队双胜朝鲜平壤队
    新华社8日讯　动作快速的北京男、女篮球队今晚在北京体育馆比赛馆举行的友谊比赛中，双双战胜了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国平壤市男、女篮球队。女子队的比数是六十八比五十一；男子队是一百比五十。
    平壤女子队今晚仍然采用了全场紧逼人盯人的防守战术，北京队根据这种情况，一方面多传球给身高一米七六的中锋杨洁，由她在篮下投篮得分；另一方面由动作灵活的马申妹、胡英信和李少芬等人切入上篮或在外围投篮，得分一直领先。上半场结束时，客队以二十一比三十二落后了十一分。
    下半场客队也换上了身材最高（一米七二）的队员赵仁花（8号）打中锋的位置，她同前锋金基玉（5号）在篮下十分活跃，北京队注意防守赵仁花时，金基玉就在外围投篮，不到两分钟她们两人就得了八分，追成二十九比三十二。主队暂停后，也开始打紧逼盯人战术，减少了对方的投篮机会，同时一截到球就展开快攻，这样才使双方比分越拉越大。杨洁、李少芬今晚表演出色，两人全场共得了四十一分。
    男子队的比赛一开始，北京队就展开了快速的攻势，奔跑快速的杨伯镛、钱澄海的巧妙配合和准确的投篮，多次博得观众喝采。北京队在上半场得的四十六分中，有三十分是他们两个人得的。
    平壤男子队身材最矮（一米七十）的队员张河洋（6号）灵活异常，他经常用变换方向的切入上篮技巧，冲过北京队的层层防守投篮得分。上半场他和本队身高一米八七的中锋姜雄（9号）共得了十八分，占全队上半场得分（二十七分）的三分之二。
    下半场北京队利用身材高大的优势，大部分时间打“双中锋”的进攻战术和人盯人防守战术，身高一米九八的鞠汾康和身高一米九十的王利发屡屡在篮下投篮得分，使对方处于被动。
