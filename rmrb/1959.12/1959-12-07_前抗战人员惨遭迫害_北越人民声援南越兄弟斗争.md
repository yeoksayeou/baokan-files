Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi -- Various agencies and organizations in North Vietnam have successively held meetings and issued statements, strongly condemning the so-called "Policy on Former Resistance Personnel" promulgated by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, which intensifies the persecution and retaliation against former resistance personnel in South Vietnam.

According to newspaper reports, deputies of the National Assembly from the South in Hanoi held a meeting at the office of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. The deputies listened to a report by representatives of the Central Unification Committee on the U.S.-Ngo clique's conspiracy to expand its military, prepare for war, and intensify the persecution of the people. The deputies expressed deep sympathy for the plight of the South Vietnamese people, warmly praised the unwavering and heroic spirit of the South Vietnamese people in their struggle against the U.S.-Ngo clique, and expressed their active support for the struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor issued a statement pointing out that the U.S.-Ngo clique's vicious conspiracy of the so-called "Policy on Former Resistance Personnel" cannot deceive anyone and will inevitably meet with shameful failure.

The statement said that the people of South Vietnam and the people of the whole country have experienced a long and arduous revolutionary struggle, and they all know that Ngo Dinh Diem is a traitor and a running dog of imperialism. The statement called on the working people of North and South Vietnam to strengthen their unity and vigorously carry out the struggle to defeat the vicious conspiracy of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

The Vietnam Women's Union issued a statement pointing out that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's so-called "Policy on Former Resistance Personnel" is to further intensify the persecution of the South Vietnamese people. This policy seriously threatens the freedom and security of the South Vietnamese people and women, seriously violates the Geneva Accords, undermines the peaceful reunification of the country, and damages the fraternal feelings of the people of the whole country.

The statement, on behalf of the Vietnamese women, accused the Ngo Dinh Diem clique before domestic and foreign public opinion of this conspiracy to legalize the fascist regime in South Vietnam, and called on women across the country to strengthen their unity and further promote the struggle against the dictatorial policies of the U.S.-Ngo clique.
