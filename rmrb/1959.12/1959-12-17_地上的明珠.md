    Pearls on the Earth
    Shí Gōng
    Lakes, lying on the vast plains, among the continuous mountains, and in the arid grasslands, are crystal clear and smooth, like shining pearls. They make the scenery beautiful and lively, with "morning glow and evening shadows, myriad of appearances," making people feel open-minded and refreshed.
    In the past, only nature could create such masterpieces. Numerous lakes are the product of crustal movement. The earth's crust sometimes fractures, with fault blocks either rising or falling, and the sunken part happens to store water to form a lake.
    The famous Dead Sea in the depression is the product of crustal subsidence. The extent of the subsidence is so dramatic that the surface of the Dead Sea is about four hundred meters lower than sea level. The Dead Sea is one end of a large depression zone, extending southward through the Red Sea to East Africa. The crustal fracture and subsidence formed a giant trough about six thousand five hundred kilometers long with varying depths. Water accumulated in the trough formed more than thirty lakes of various sizes, such as Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Malawi, like a string of pearls.
    Although the water surface of Lake Baikal is more than eight hundred meters higher than that of the Dead Sea, its bottom is more than five hundred meters lower than that of the Dead Sea, with the lowest point about one thousand three hundred meters below sea level, making it the deepest lake in the world. Lake Baikal was also formed by crustal fracture and subsidence accumulating water, and it may still be subsiding. China's Qinghai Lake, Dianchi Lake, Erhai Lake, etc., were also formed in this way.
    However, many lakes are not caused by crustal movement. In the middle and lower reaches of rivers, the river water erodes both banks, making the river channel more and more curved. This phenomenon is very significant in the Yangtze River near Wuhan. When the river water opens up a relatively straight channel, the original channel is silted up to form a lake. On the plains formed by river siltation, the uneven accumulation of sediment in various places makes the ground uneven, and water can accumulate in the depressions to form lakes.
    Many lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China are mainly caused by the above reasons, while West Lake was formed when a bay separated from the sea. When the sandbars piled up by sediment on the seashore rise above the water surface, they isolate them into lakes. The formation process of the above several types of lakes is not completely free from the influence of crustal movement.
    There are also many lakes with various peculiar causes: the "Heavenly Lake" on the top of Changbai Mountain is a volcanic crater filled with rainwater, while Jingpo Lake to its north was formed about one million years ago when lava flowing out of a volcano blocked the Mudan River. Sediments such as sand and gravel carried by glaciers can also block and retain flowing water. Especially because glaciers can scrape many pits and depressions on the ground during sliding, which are convenient for water storage, the lakes formed in this way are often as dense as stars. Many lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are mainly formed in this way. Finland has tens of thousands of lakes, making it the country with the most lakes in the world, which is also the result of glacial action. The wind can also blow the ground into depressions, and lakes in desert areas are often formed in this way. The famous Juyan Lake is one of them. Groundwater dissolves soluble rocks underground to create cavities. If even the top of the cave is dissolved, it becomes a "dragon pool" with abundant water sources. The Black Dragon Pool near Kunming is this type of lake. The formation of some lakes is even more peculiar. In Ghana, there is a lake that was formed by a meteorite impacting the ground, creating a deep pit that accumulated water. In the Pamirs, an earthquake in 1911 caused a mountain cliff to collapse and block the river, creating a lake with an area of ​​fifty square kilometers.
    For these reasons, tens of thousands of lakes have formed on the earth. Although the total area of ​​lakes only accounts for 1.8% of the land area and the water storage capacity is only about one five-thousandth of that of the ocean, some of them can regulate river water flow and are good natural reservoirs; they can store floods, irrigate, generate electricity, raise fish, and breed many other useful aquatic organisms, and some lakes are also readily available salt repositories, alkali repositories, borax repositories... In addition, they can also improve the climate, so they have a great impact on mankind, and we are trying our best to create more lakes. In the history of the earth, the formation of a lake may take tens of thousands of years, but since the Great Leap Forward last year, we have built more than fifteen thousand artificial lakes. This is the power of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes! We must continue to conquer nature and scatter pearls all over the earth.

    地上的明珠
    石工
    湖泊，躺在那辽阔的原野上、绵亘的山丛间、干旱的草原里，晶莹滑润，好像颗颗明珠。她使景色变得秀丽而生动，“朝辉夕阴，气象万千”，令人胸怀开朗，心旷神怡。
    过去，只有大自然能有这样的杰作。为数众多的湖泊是地壳运动的产物。地壳有时会发生断裂，断块或隆起或陷落，陷落下去那部分正好蓄水成湖。
    著名的洼地死海，就是地壳陷落的产物。陷落的程度是如此剧烈，以致死海的水面比海平面约低四百米。死海是一个大的陷落带的一端，由此往南经红海入东非，地壳断裂陷落成长约六千五百公里深浅不一的巨槽，槽中蓄水处形成了维多利亚湖、坦噶尼喀湖、尼亚萨湖等大小三十多个湖泊，好似一串珍珠。
    贝加尔湖的水面虽然要比死海的水面高出八百多米，但是它的底比死海的底要低五百多米，最低处低于海平面约一千三百米，成为世界上最深的湖。贝加尔湖也是地壳断裂陷落蓄水而成的，目前可能还在继续陷落。我国的青海、滇池、洱海等也是这样形成的。
    但是，也有不少湖泊不是地壳运动造成的，在河流的中下游，由于河水向两岸侵蚀，使河道变得愈来愈弯曲，如武汉附近的长江，这种现象就很显著。当河水另行冲开了一条较为直捷的河道以后，原来的河道便淤塞成湖了。在河流淤积而成的平原上，因为各处堆积的泥沙多少不一，使地面凹凸不平，在下凹处也可以积水成湖。
    我国长江中下游许多湖泊主要是以上原因造成的，西湖则由于海湾脱离了大海而形成。泥沙在海边堆起的沙坝高出了水面时，使得它们隔离成湖。以上几种湖泊的形成过程中，并不是都摆脱了地壳运动的影响。
    还有许多湖泊有着种种奇特的成因：长白山顶的“天池”，那是蓄满了雨水的火山口，在它北面的镜泊湖则是约在一百万年前火山流出的熔岩堵塞了牡丹江而成。冰川挟带的砂砾泥土等堆积物也能堵塞拦蓄流水，特别因为冰川在滑动时能将地面刨刮出许多坑洼便于蓄水，因此造成的湖泊往往密如繁星。西藏高原上许多湖泊主要是这样形成的。芬兰能拥有湖泊数万个，成为世界上湖泊最多的国家，也是冰川作用的结果。风也能将地面吹成洼地，沙漠地区的湖泊常有这样造成的，著名的居延海就是其中之一。地下水在地下把易溶的岩石溶掉造成空洞，如果连洞顶也溶穿了，这时成了水源旺盛的“龙潭”，昆明附近的黑龙潭就是这种湖。有些湖泊的成因更为奇特，在加纳有一个湖是陨石冲击地面造成深坑后蓄水而成的。在帕米尔，1911年发生的地震使山崖崩塌堵塞了河流，造成了一个面积为五十平方公里的湖。
    由于这些原因，地球上形成了数以万计的湖泊。湖泊总面积虽仅占大陆面积的1.8％，蓄水量不过海洋的五千分之一左右，但是它们有的可以调节河流水量，是良好的天然水库；能够蓄洪、灌溉、发电、养鱼和繁殖其他许多有用的水生生物，有的湖泊更是取用方便的盐库、碱库、硼砂库……。此外，它们还可以改善气候，因此对人类的影响极大，我们正在尽力设法制造出更多的湖泊。在地球的历史上，一处湖泊的形成，也许要成千上万年，但是去年大跃进以来我们建成的人工湖就在一万五千个以上，这是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的威力！我们还要继续战胜自然，把明珠撒遍大地。
