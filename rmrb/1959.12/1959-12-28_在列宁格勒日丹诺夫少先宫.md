　　At the Zhdanov Palace of Pioneers in Leningrad

    We spent a meaningful and interesting evening at the Zhdanov Palace of Pioneers in Leningrad. We were surrounded by children, singing "Song of Friendship," dancing joyfully, and clapping enthusiastically and rhythmically to the beat of the dance. Some Pioneers came up and tied red scarves around our necks. At that moment, even the most mature comrades felt much younger and unconsciously began to sing and dance with them.
    This is a Palace of Pioneers with a long history and a very large scale. Its construction began on February 12, 1937. Now it has three hundred and sixty rooms, arranged with various fascinating activities. Children here can receive technical education, art education, physical education, and natural science education, and read all kinds of fresh and interesting books.
    In the International Club, we met the director of the club—a student from Leningrad's No. 239 School. This Young Pioneer very skillfully told us: "We hope to establish and maintain close contact with children from other countries, and this house helps us realize this wish. The club regularly exhibits some activities of Young Pioneer organizations from fraternal countries. From this house, we saw gifts sent by socialist brother countries—Young Pioneer flags, activity photos of Young Pioneers, books and magazines, records, etc. The Chinese section is placed in a very prominent position, where children can see the scenery of Beijing, the learning, labor, and life of Chinese Young Pioneers. If you like, you can also sit there and listen to Chinese music. Soviet children are very concerned about the socialist construction of New China and care about the Young Pioneers of New China, repeatedly expressing their desire for us to convey their respect to the Young Pioneers of New China. In this International Club, they see that the Young Pioneers of New China, like them, are future reserve forces for building socialism and communism in the motherland. The deep fraternal friendship established between these two strong reserve forces in their youth will take firm root in the common cause in the future.
    The Soviet people love labor, and this point also makes an unforgettable impression in the Zhdanov Palace of Pioneers. In the Technical Education Department, we saw some children in grades six to ten learning to operate small lathes for metal processing, woodworking, and machine tool processing. The room was filled with various models of machines and tractors, models of excavation machinery, and many handicrafts and children's toys made by their own hands. "Ice hockey" is a very good sport in winter, and the children are using their own made "ice hockey" models to conduct a contest, cultivating their interests and activity abilities from there.
    Soviet children have broad interests, and the knowledge they pursue is extremely rich and diverse. They try to use their spare time to enrich their practical knowledge here. Children who love literature and art can come to the Folk Art Room (also called the Story Room) to see all kinds of murals, depicting images from Gorky's "The Song of the Stormy Petrel," "The Song of the Falcon," "Old Izergil," and Pushkin's "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish." In another room, children are concentrating on playing chess. Some first-class chess players have already been trained here to participate in national competitions. In addition, we also saw photos taken by the children's photography group, as well as various models such as iron bridges, motorcycles, the Lenin nuclear icebreaker, and cranes.
    What is particularly interesting is the Palace of Pioneers' planetarium. The lights are off, and you seem to have entered the universe, with only various planets in front of you. We saw how the Earth revolves around the Sun, how space rockets are launched to the Moon, and how one revolution of the planet farthest from the Sun is equal to hundreds of years on Earth. After watching all this, one feels as happy as if we had just returned from a trip to outer space.
    Soviet children have great ideals for their future. A slogan we saw in the Palace of Pioneers boldly reads: "We will grow in study and labor, and open up the road to distant planets." This generation of Soviet people has already begun to explore such a path. It can be predicted that when the next generation grows up, they will definitely be able to realize this task.
    As we bid farewell to 1959 and welcome the new year of 1960, I congratulate them on greater happiness and progress in the new year! (Attached picture)

　　在列宁格勒日丹诺夫少先宫
　　周保昌
    我们在列宁格勒的日丹诺夫少先宫过了一个有意义而又有趣的晚上。我们被孩子们包围起来，他们唱着“友谊之歌”，跳着快乐的舞蹈，随着舞蹈的拍子，鼓起热烈的、有节奏的掌声。有一些队员上来给我们围上了红领巾。这一刹那，再老成的同志也会觉得顿时年轻许多，不知不觉地同他们一起载歌载舞起来。
    这是一座历史悠久、规模极大的少先宫。它开始建成在1937年2月12日。现在有三百六十个房间，布置着各种各样引人入胜的活动。孩子们在这里可以接受技术教育、艺术教育、体育教育、自然科学教育，读到各种新鲜有趣的书籍。
    在国际俱乐部我们遇见了俱乐部的主任——列宁格勒第二百三十九学校学生。这位少先队员，非常熟练地告诉我们：“我们希望同其他国家的儿童建立和密切保持联系，这所房子就是帮助我们实现这个心愿的。俱乐部定期展览兄弟国家少先队的一些活动。从这所房子里，我们看到了社会主义兄弟国家送来的礼品——少先队的队旗、少先队员的活动照片、书报杂志、唱片等。其中中国部分放在十分显著的地位，在那里儿童们可以看到北京的风光，中国少先队队员的学习、劳动、生活方面的情况，如果你喜欢，还可以在那里坐下来听听中国的音乐。苏联孩子们非常关心新中国的社会主义建设，关怀新中国的少先队员，一再的表示要我们转达他们对新中国少先队队员的敬意。在这个国际俱乐部里，他们看到新中国的少先队员同他们一样，是今后为祖国建设社会主义和共产主义的后备力量。这两支雄厚的后备力量在少年时代就建立起来的兄弟般的深厚友谊，会在今后的共同事业中扎下结结实实的根。
    苏联人民是热爱劳动的，这一点在日丹诺夫少先宫里也给人难忘的印象。我们在技术教育部里看到一些六年级到十年级的孩子正在学习操作金属加工、木器加工、机床加工的小型车床，屋里陈列着各种各样机器拖拉机的模型，挖土机构造的模型以及经过他们双手劳动而制成的许多工艺品、儿童玩具。“冰球”在冬天是一种很好的运动方式，孩子们用自己制造的“冰球”模型正在进行着双方的争夺战，从那里培养自己的兴趣与活动能力。
    苏联儿童的兴趣是广泛的，他们所追求的知识也是极其丰富而多样的，他们尽量利用课余来这里丰富自己的实践知识。爱好文艺的孩子，可以到民间文艺室（又叫故事室）里来看各种各样的壁画，上面画着高尔基的“海燕”、“鹰之歌”、“伊则吉尔老婆子”和普希金的“金鱼与渔夫的故事”中的形象。在另一间房子里，孩子们正在聚精会神地下着棋子。这里已经培养了一些一级棋手参加全国的比赛。此外，我们还看了儿童摄影小组拍的照片，以及如铁桥、摩托、列宁号原子破冰船、起重机等各种各样的模型。
    使人特别感到兴趣的是少先宫的天文馆。电灯熄了，你仿佛进入了宇宙上空，眼前只是各种各样的星球。我们看到地球如何围绕太阳而转动，宇宙火箭如何发射到了月球，离太阳最远的星球如果它围绕太阳转一周，就等于地球上的几百年。看完所有这一切，使人感到我们已在宇宙空间旅行刚回来一样地高兴。
    苏联儿童对自己的未来抱有远大的理想，在少先宫里我们所看到的一条标语上豪迈地写着：“我们要在学习劳动中生长，开拓走向辽远星球的道路”。这一代的苏联人民已经开始开拓着这样的道路，可以预料，在这下一代生长起来以后，一定可以实现这个任务。
    在欢送1959年迎接新的1960年到来的时候，我祝贺他们在新的一年里更加幸福与进步！（附图片）
