Xinhua News Agency reported: A national upsurge in raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer has taken shape. The number of pigs raised is skyrocketing, increasing by 11% in September compared to June, 5.4% in October compared to September, and 9% in November compared to October. The pig-raising industry is developing at an unprecedented rate in many regions. In November, the total number of pigs raised in the five provinces of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Jiangsu increased by 18% compared to October. According to incomplete statistics from some areas in twenty-one provinces (municipalities) and regions, four counties, eighty-two people's communes, and more than five thousand production teams have achieved one pig per mu of land nationwide.

This newspaper reported: Shandong, Hebei, Hunan, Sichuan and other nine provinces and regions have recently seen significant developments in pig production.

　　Launch a Pig Raising Assault Month Campaign

　　Shandong

All parts of Shandong responded to the call of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and launched a "Pig Raising as the Main Task, Six Domestic Animals Flourishing" assault month campaign from November 22nd. During the campaign, 65,000 new collective pig farms were built throughout the province. Together with the original collective pig farms in each commune, there are now an average of more than two pig farms per production team in the province.

Because the people's communes in various regions resolutely implemented the policy of collective raising as the main focus, combined with private raising, the proportion of collective pig raising continued to rise during the assault month, and the number of private raising by commune members also increased. At present, the proportion of publicly raised pigs in Yantai, Linyi, Liaocheng and other regions has reached about 60%.

Vigorously grasping breeding and reproduction work is one of the key tasks of the assault month. According to statistics from Jinan, Heze, Changwei, Zibo and other four regions as of December 15, more than 80% of the sows of breeding age have been mated and are pregnant.

　　The Experience of Kuixingzhuang in Raising Pigs is Blossoming Everywhere

　　Hebei

People's communes in various parts of Hebei Province have widely launched the "Learn from, Catch up with, and Surpass Kuixingzhuang Production Team" (see page 1 of this newspaper on December 17 for the experience of Kuixingzhuang Production Team in raising pigs) campaign to develop pig production, enabling the province's pig production to show a situation of greater, faster, better and more economical results. Party committees at all levels are led by the first secretary and have established leading bodies. Many counties, communes, and production teams have also organized strong pig-raising teams to develop the pig-raising industry. The Handan area, which is rich in cotton, has developed to more than 1.9 million pigs. In the Shijiazhuang area, in the first half of November alone, 500,000 pigs were added, equivalent to the total increase in pigs in September and October. Pig production in the cold regions north of the Great Wall has also made great progress. According to incomplete statistics as of December 10, one county, twelve communes, and four hundred and eighty-seven production teams in the province have achieved one pig per mu of land; more than 69,000 pig farms have been established in the high-yield wheat areas of the province, raising more than 4.82 million pigs.

　　Building Pig Farms While Planting Feed

　　Hunan

The proportion of collective pig raising in Hunan Province has increased from 30% before communization to the current 85% of the total number of pigs raised in the province. In order to meet the needs of the rapid development of collective pig raising, people's communes in various regions have renovated 30,000 pig farms of all sizes by using local materials, building new ones and repairing old ones. Together with the renovated and expanded pig sties, the total pigsty area has increased, which can raise more than 5 million pigs. In order to strengthen the leadership in farm construction, the secretaries of the party committees at all levels personally took action to comprehensively plan, so that the layout of the pig farms is not only conducive to planting feed, reforming tools, and scientific feeding, but also conducive to transporting manure to the fields, so that pig farm construction can be better integrated with the overall agricultural production development plan.

In the process of adding pig farms, Hunan Province has adopted the method of building farms, planting feed, and raising sows at the same time, which has accelerated the development of the pig raising industry. In more than a month, the Guoqing People's Commune in Yiyang County built more than 6,500 new pigsties and renovated 3,895 pigsties, which can raise more than 15,000 pigs. At the same time, the commune organized 63 mating personnel to mate all 513 sows in the commune, and newly bred 6,514 sows; and arranged more than 1,400 laborers to rush to plant 1,758 mu of feed, and ensiled 4,000 catties of feed per pig in stock for the winter.

　　Urban and Rural Masses Raise Pigs Together

　　Sichuan

In Sichuan Province, rural areas, urban areas, government agencies, troops, factories, mines, schools, etc. are all starting to raise pigs.

In order to conscientiously implement the policy of "public ownership and public raising as the main focus" and expand the proportion of collective pig raising, various special districts have recently launched the "Hundred, Thousand, Ten Thousand" pig raising campaign, requiring that county-level units have more than 10,000 pigs "owned and raised publicly", commune-level units have 500 to 1,000 pigs, and management district-level units have 50 to 100 pigs within the next year. At present, the masses in various regions have taken action to plant high-yield feed in large quantities, use dilapidated houses to rebuild pig farms, and solve the source of pigs through self-breeding and self-raising. According to incomplete statistics, the number of pigs raised by government agencies, schools, groups, etc. throughout the province has reached more than 800,000, and more than 590 units in Chongqing and Chengdu alone have achieved self-sufficiency in meat.

In order to further develop the pig raising industry, all communes have launched a "five full" campaign of full mating, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full strength. In terms of feed, as early as October, the entire province, taking counties as units, combined the sweet potato harvest to launch a "10,000 nests and 100 million catties" ensiling sweet potato vine campaign. According to incomplete statistics from seven special districts, more than 4 billion catties of sweet potato vines have been stored. The entire province strives to reach more than 1,000 catties of green and dry feed per pig recently.

　　Make Do with What is Available and Build Pig Farms Diligently and Frugally

　　Jiangsu

In accordance with the spirit of running pig farms diligently and frugally, party committees at all levels in Jiangsu fully mobilized the masses, adopted the method of building farms while raising pigs, relied on their own efforts, made do with what was available, used local materials, and built pigsties in a greater, faster, better and more economical way. When building pigsties on a large scale in many communes in the Yancheng Special District, if there was a shortage of wood, they used tree sticks instead; if there was a shortage of bricks and tiles, they used reeds and thatch instead; and if there was a shortage of bamboo, they used sunflower stalks and reed stalks instead. Many commune members also took the initiative to invest their temporarily unused old timber, bricks, tiles and other materials in the commune to solve the difficulty of insufficient materials for building pigsties on a large scale.

In order to meet the needs of running pig farms on a large scale and developing collective pig raising at a high speed, various regions have adopted the methods of keeping sows whenever they are found, selecting later after keeping them first, and self-breeding and self-raising to vigorously grasp breeding work. In the Yancheng Special District, more than 29,000 new sows were selected and retained in November; after a short period of concentrated effort in the Suzhou Special District, more than 30,000 sows were mated and more than 60,000 small sows were selected and retained. At present, the province raises more than 8 million pigs, and the proportion of collective breeding is increasing.

　　Party Committees at All Levels Strengthen Leadership

　　Guangxi

Over the past four months, the pig raising industry in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has made great progress. According to statistics as of the end of November, the number of pigs in stock in the entire region reached more than 5.17 million, an increase of 29.37% compared to July. The development of collective pig raising has been particularly rapid: collective pig raising in the entire region has reached more than 3 million pigs.

The rapid development of the pig raising industry is mainly due to the strengthening of leadership by party committees at all levels and the correct implementation of the policy of "walking on two legs" of giving priority to the development of collective breeding and combining public and private breeding. For example, the first secretary of the Yongfu County Party Committee took the lead, and the deputy secretaries and members of the party committees of nine communes "sat in" at the pig farms to personally take charge; the deputy secretaries of the party committees of all fifteen communes in the county and more than 300 deputy leaders in sideline production generally engaged in pig raising experimental farms and experimental pens to create experience to drive the overall situation. Therefore, the proportion of collective pig raising in the entire special district rapidly increased from 41% of the total number of pigs at the end of September to 60% of the total number of pigs at the end of October. Vigorously grasping the breeding work of pigs, so that the source of pigs continues to increase, is also an important reason for the rapid development of pigs.

　　Keep Sows Whenever They Are Found, Self-Breeding and Self-Raising

　　Anhui

In order to meet the needs of the development of the pig raising industry, various regions in Anhui Province are actively strengthening feeding management and sow selection work. By the end of November, the province had harvested and stored more than 7 billion catties of feed, an increase of 2.3 times compared to the end of October. Various regions have also strengthened feed processing work. According to incomplete statistics from Mengcheng, Fuyang, and Funan counties in the Fuyang Special District alone, more than 9,600 new pig feed processing plants (groups) have recently been built, so that every commune and team has a feed processing plant.

In order to prepare for the further development of pig raising, various regions are actively selecting and retaining sows. In the Liu'an Special District, special personnel are assigned to manage sows, and every sow is kept whenever she is found, and selected later after being kept. In November, the entire special district raised more than 240,000 sows, an increase of 37.1% compared to the end of September. The province newly retained a total of 357,000 sows in November.

　　Public Raising as the Main Focus, Combining Public and Private Raising

　　Guizhou

Mass pig raising campaigns have been launched in various regions of Guizhou. In areas that have taken action quickly, the party committee secretary has taken personal command, established pig raising leading bodies at all levels, mobilized the masses, built pig farms on a large scale, raised sows on a large scale, and implemented both public and private raising, which has achieved remarkable results. The Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has built and expanded more than 3,400 pig farms. The eight people's communes in Duyun City established 55 pig farms in the recent ten days. The Anshun Special District has reserved sufficient feed bases according to the standard of one pig per mu of land. The Bijie Special District has injected pig cholera vaccine into 810,000 pigs.

According to statistics as of the end of November, six communes and more than 160 production teams in the province have achieved one pig per mu of land. Of the pigs in stock in the province, the public raising part accounts for 56%.

　　Pastoral People Vigorously Raise Pigs

　　Inner Mongolia

The pig raising industry in the pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has developed rapidly. At present, about 100,000 Mongolian herdsmen have raised more than 80,000 pigs.

Mongolian herdsmen on the Abaga Banner pasture in the Xilingol League never raised pigs in the past. After the establishment of the Bayan Xile People's Commune, feed bases were actively opened up on the pasture. Now the entire commune has raised more than 500 pigs. The seven production teams of the Bayinhan Commune in the Bairin Right Banner of the Zhaowuda League have established feeding farms in every team, and collectively and commune members jointly raise 1,180 pigs, showing a prosperous scene of fat pigs filling the pens.

The pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia have many favorable conditions for developing the pig raising industry. On the vast pastures, a variety of wild feed grows, which can graze pig herds, and various dairy by-products can also be fully utilized to feed pigs.

　　全国养猪高潮形成
    养猪头数9月份比6月份增加11％，10月份比9月份增加5.4％，11月份比10月份增加9％。各地党委正进一步加强领导，贯彻以公养为主公私并举方针，继续大力发展养猪事业。
    据新华社讯　全国养猪积肥高潮已经形成，养猪头数扶摇直上，9月份比6月份增加11％，10月份又比9月份增加5.4％，11月份又比10月份增加9％。许多地区养猪事业发展之快前所未有。11月份河南、河北、山东、山西和江苏五省的养猪总头数，比10月份就增加了18％。据二十一个省（市）区部分地区的不完全统计，全国已有四个县、八十二个人民公社和五千多个生产队实现了一亩地一头猪。
    本报讯　山东、河北、湖南、四川等九个省区最近养猪生产有了很大的发展。
　　开展养猪突击月运动
　　山东
    山东各地响应中共山东省委号召，从11月22日开展了“以养猪为主，六畜兴旺”的突击月运动。在运动中，全省新建集体养猪场六万五千处，连同各公社原有的集体养猪场，现在全省每个生产队平均有二个多养猪场。
    由于各地人民公社坚决执行了以公养为主公私并举的方针，在突击月中，集体养猪比例不断上升，社员私养数量也有增加。目前，烟台、临沂、聊城等地区的公养猪比例已达到60％左右。
    大抓配种繁殖工作，是突击月的重点任务之一。济宁、菏泽、昌潍、淄博等四个地区到12月15日统计，适龄母猪已有80％以上配种满怀。
　　魁星庄养猪经验遍地开花
　　河北
    河北省各地人民公社广泛展开“学、赶、超魁星庄生产队”（魁星庄生产队养猪经验见12月17日本报一版）发展养猪生产运动，使全省养猪生产出现了多快好省的局面。各级党委都由第一书记挂帅，建立了领导机构。许多县、社和生产队还组织了坚强的养猪队伍，发展养猪事业。盛产棉花的邯郸地区，已发展到一百九十多万头猪。石家庄地区仅11月上半月，就增加了五十万头猪，相当9、10两月生猪增加的总和。长城以北高寒地区的养猪生产，也有了很大发展。据12月10日不完全统计，全省已有一个县、十二个公社和四百八十七个生产队实现了一亩地一头猪；全省已在小麦丰产方建立了六万九千多个养猪场，养猪四百八十二万二千多头。
　　边建猪场　边种饲料
　　湖南
    湖南省集体养猪占全省养猪总数的比重，已由公社化以前的30％上升到目前的85％。适应集体养猪迅速发展的需要，各地人民公社用就地取材、新建与整修并举的办法增修了三万个大小养猪场，加上整修扩建的猪栏，总共约增加了能养五百多万猪的猪舍面积。为加强建场领导，各级党委书记都亲自动手，全面规划，使养猪场的布局既便于种植饲料、改革工具、科学饲养，又便于运肥下田，使猪场建设与整个农业生产发展规划更好地结合起来。
    湖南省各地在增建养猪场中，都采取边建场、边种饲料、边育母猪的办法，加速了养猪业的发展。益阳县国庆人民公社在一个多月中，新建猪栏六千五百多间，整修猪栏三千八百九十五间，可以养猪一万五千多头。与此同时，公社组织了六十三名配种人员把全社五百一十三头母猪全部配上种，并新蓄母猪六千五百一十四头；安排一千四百多个劳力突击种饲料一千七百五十八亩，每头存栏猪青贮了四千斤饲料过冬。
　　城乡群众一齐养猪
　　四川
    四川省农村、城乡、机关部队、厂矿、学校等都一齐动手养猪。
    为了认真贯彻“公有公养为主”的方针，扩大集体养猪的比重，各个专区最近纷纷开展了“百、千、万”养猪运动，要求明年内县一级有“公有公养”猪万头以上，公社一级五百至一千头，管理区一级五十至一百头。目前，各地群众已经行动起来，大量种高产饲料，利用破旧房屋改建养猪场，自繁自养解决猪源。全省机关、学校、团体等的养猪数量，据不完全统计，目前已达八十万头以上，仅重庆、成都两市就有五百九十多个单位做到了肉食自给。
    为了进一步发展养猪业，各公社开展了全配、全怀、全生、全活、全壮的“五全”运动。在饲料方面，早在10月份全省即以县为单位结合红苕收获，开展了“万窝亿斤”青贮苕藤运动，据七个专区的不完全统计已贮苕藤四十多亿斤。全省力争最近达到每头猪有一千斤以上青、干饲料。
    因陋就简　勤俭建猪场
　　江苏
    江苏各级党委根据勤俭办猪场的精神，充分发动群众，采取边养猪边建场的办法，自力更生，因陋就简，就地取材，多快好省地大建猪舍。盐城专区许多公社在大建猪舍时，缺少木材就用树棍子代替，缺少砖瓦就用芦苇、茅草代替，缺少竹子就用向日葵秸和芦柴代替。许多社员还主动地把自己暂时不用的旧木料、砖瓦等材料投资给社里，解决大建猪舍材料不足的困难。
    为了适应大办养猪场，高速度发展集体养猪的需要，各地采取见母必留，先留后选，自繁自养的办法，大抓繁殖工作。盐城专区11月份新选留母猪二万九千多头；苏州专区经过短期突击，配种母猪三万多头，选留小母猪六万多头。现在，全省养猪达八百多万头，集体饲养的比重正在增加。
　　各级党委加强领导
　　广西
    四个月来，广西僮族自治区养猪事业有了很大发展。截至11月底统计，全区猪只存栏数达到五百一十七万多头，比7月份增长29.37％。集体养猪发展特别迅速：全区集体养猪达三百多万头。
    养猪事业迅速发展，主要由于各级党委加强了领导，正确贯彻执行了养猪以发展集体饲养为主，公养私养并举的“两条腿走路”的方针。如永福县委第一书记挂帅，九个公社党委副书记和委员“坐镇”猪场，亲自掌握；全县十五个公社党委副书记和三百多个副业领导干部普遍搞了养猪试验场、试验栏，做出经验带动全面。因此，全专区集体养猪由9月底占总头数的41％到10月底迅速上升到占总头数的60％。大抓猪的繁殖工作，使猪源不断增加，也是猪只迅速发展的一个重要原因。
　　见母必留　自繁自养
　　安徽
    安徽省各地适应养猪事业发展的需要，积极加强饲养管理和选留母猪工作。全省到11月底已采贮饲料七十多亿斤，比10月底增加了二点三倍。各地还加强了饲料加工工作。仅阜阳专区的蒙城、阜阳、阜南三个县的不完全统计，最近就新建了九千六百多个猪饲料加工厂（组），达到社社队队都有饲料加工厂。
    各地为进一步发展养猪作准备，正在积极选留母猪。六安专区实行专人专管母猪、做到见母猪就留，先留后选。11月份全专区饲养母猪二十四万多头，比9月底增长了37.1％。全省在11月份内共新留母猪三十五万七千头。
　　公养为主　公私并举
　　贵州
    贵州各地已开展了群众性养猪运动。动手快的地区，由于党委书记亲自挂帅，层层建立了各级养猪领导机构，发动群众，大建养猪场，大养母猪，公养私养双管齐下，已取得显著成绩。黔南布依族苗族自治州新建和扩建的养猪场达三千四百多个。都匀市的八个人民公社在最近十天就办起五十五个养猪场。安顺专区已按一头猪一分地的标准留足饲料基地。毕节专区已给八十一万头猪注射了猪瘟预防针。
    据11月底统计，全省已有六个公社、一百六十多个生产队达到一亩地一头猪。在全省存栏猪中，公养部分已占56％。
　　牧区人民大力养猪
　　内蒙古
    内蒙古自治区牧区的养猪业迅速发展，目前约十万户蒙古族牧民已经饲养了八万多口猪。
    锡林郭勒草原阿巴嘎旗牧场上的蒙古族牧民，过去从来不养猪。巴彦锡勒人民公社建立后，在牧场上积极开辟饲料基地，现在全社已经饲养了五百多口猪。昭乌达盟巴林右旗白音汉公社七个生产队，队队建立饲养场，集体和社员共养猪一千一百八十口，出现了肥猪满圈的繁荣景象。
    内蒙古牧区有许多发展养猪业的便利条件。在广阔的牧场上，生长有多种野生饲料，可以放牧猪群，同时还能充分利用各种奶副产品喂猪。
