The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session Passes Resolution on Developing Agriculture
Calls for Early Completion of the Agricultural Seven-Year Plan
The Plenary Session believes that grain and cash crop production should be increased by expanding cultivated land and increasing yields per unit area; meat production should be greatly increased; each district, agricultural cooperative, and state farm should formulate measures to complete the Seven-Year Plan and 1960 production tasks ahead of schedule; the Plenary Session approves the proposal to reduce production costs and purchase prices of some agricultural products; according to the level of public economic development, the proportion of reserve funds in the cash income of agricultural cooperatives should be increased; the Plenary Session entrusts the Presidium to study and discuss the opinions on the establishment of joint collective farm organizations while reorganizing agricultural institutions; fuller use should be made of scientific achievements; economically backward agricultural cooperatives should be brought up to the level of advanced ones; and measures should be determined to implement further comprehensive mechanization in agricultural production.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 26th (TASS): The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on the development of agriculture on the 25th.

The resolution stated that the Soviet Union now possesses all the necessary conditions to further vigorously develop all sectors of agricultural production. The large-scale national movement and domestic socialist competition to catch up with and surpass the United States in meat, milk, and oil production per capita in the next few years demonstrate that the tasks of the seven-year plan for agricultural development can be completed ahead of schedule.

The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session believes that the most important task is to increase grain production to at least 10 billion to 11 billion poods per year, in order to create a realistic possibility for forming stable commercial grain resources. To this end, it was decided to expand the sown area of ​​grain crops by reclaiming wasteland and improving cultivation levels.

The resolution recommends that local organizations take measures to expand cultivated land and increase the yield per unit area of ​​sugar beets, cotton, and other cash crops.

The resolution points out that, due to the socialist competition unfolding in the countryside, it can be confidently stated that the task of meat production (16 million tons) in the Seven-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule in 1963.

The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session believes that in order to fulfill the task of catching up with the United States in per capita meat production, it is necessary to achieve an annual output of 20 million to 21 million tons of meat. The Plenary Session calls on all agricultural workers to overfulfill the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan and produce an additional 4 million to 5 million tons of meat.

The resolution recommends that each district, collective farm, and state farm formulate measures to complete the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Special attention should be paid to ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the task of increasing agricultural production in 1960, the second year of the Seven-Year Plan.

The Central Committee Plenary Session approved the proposal to reduce the production costs of seed cotton, tea, melons, grapes, fruits, and wool in collective farms and to reduce the purchase prices of certain agricultural products sold by collective farms to the state. In this way, these prices will be close to the delivery prices of state farm products, which will make it possible to further reduce the national retail prices of consumer goods and further improve the material living standards of the Soviet people.

Based on the current level of development of the public economy, the Central Committee Plenary Session believes that it is appropriate to increase the proportion of reserve funds in cash income according to the resolutions of the congresses of collective farm members. This cash should first be used to purchase machinery and equipment, to build and carry out other facilities to ensure the rapid improvement of the collective farm economy, and to build residential houses for collective farmers on installments.

The Plenary Session entrusts the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee to study and discuss the opinions on the establishment of joint collective farm organizations while reorganizing agricultural institutions. The resolution pointed out that the task of further improving agriculture requires changing the organizational form of the leadership of collective farms, in order to further promote the democracy of collective farms.

The Central Committee Plenary Session believes that the most important task of agricultural science is to carry out theoretical research work on the basis of more fully utilizing the latest achievements of biology, physics, chemistry, and other related sciences that ensure increased productivity and continuous improvement of agricultural technology.

The resolution points out that it is of great significance to raise the economically backward collective farms to the level of advanced collective farms. The key condition to achieving this is to equip these units with experienced and technically skilled cadres.

The Central Committee Plenary Session determined the measures to implement further comprehensive mechanization in agricultural production.

The Central Committee Plenary Session noted with satisfaction that in the period since the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (January-February 1959), the Soviet Union has made tremendous new achievements in the development of industry and agriculture, in the improvement of the people's material welfare, and in the implementation of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.

The industrial production plan for the first eleven months of this year was overfulfilled, and 40 billion rubles of industrial products were produced above the plan. During this period, industrial production increased by 11.3% compared with the same period last year, while the plan stipulated an increase of 7.7%.

The Central Committee Plenary Session resolution believes that the summary of the work in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan shows that the Soviet Union's industry is developing at a higher speed than the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan.

The plan to accelerate technological progress in industry and construction is being successfully implemented.

The achievements made in 1959 make it possible to determine the level of industrial production in the national economic development plan for the second year of the Seven-Year Plan, which greatly exceeds the original control figures for 1960.

The resolution points out that collective farms and state farms have overfulfilled the sowing plan for spring crops in 1959. This year, the total sown area of ​​crops is 196 million hectares, which is nearly 40 million hectares more than in 1953.

Although there was a drought in many large grain-producing areas in the country, the state still purchased enough grain this year.

Meat production in collective farms and state farms increased by 32% in eleven months, milk increased by 15%, eggs increased by 25%, and wool increased by 11%.

The Central Committee Plenary Session resolution pointed out that in 1959, the Soviet Union will produce 62 million tons of milk, which will exceed the total milk production of the United States by more than 5 million tons.

This year, the production of oils and fats is 845,000 tons, which is 4 kg per capita. This exceeds the per capita production of oils and fats in the United States, which is estimated to be about 3.7 kg per capita this year.

The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session states that the experience of advanced units and advanced figures and their achievements in increasing agricultural production make people firmly believe that every collective farm and state farm, every state and republic can successfully complete the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan and realize the guarantee of completing this task ahead of schedule.

The Plenary Session calls on agricultural workers, all working people, party organizations at all levels, Soviet, trade union and Communist Youth League organizations to give full play to their creativity to realize the socialist guarantee of completing the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule and producing abundant agricultural products, and make due contributions to the cause of the people's struggle for building communism in the Soviet Union.

　　苏共中央全会通过关于发展农业的决议
　　号召提前完成农业七年计划
    全会认为，应通过扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量，提高谷类和技术作物的产量；大大提高肉类生产；每个区、农庄和国营农场都拟定提前完成七年计划和1960年生产任务的措施；全会赞同降低一些农产品生产成本和收购价格的建议；根据公有经济发展水平，应增加农庄现金收入中的公积金的提成；全会责成主席团在改组农业机构工作的同时，研究并讨论成立集体农庄联合机构的意见；更充分地利用科学成就；把经济上落后的农庄提高到先进水平；确定在农业生产中实行进一步全面机械化的措施。
    新华社莫斯科26日电　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议在25日通过了关于发展农业的决议。
    决议中说，目前苏联国内具备了一切必要条件来进一步大力发展农业生产的各个部门。争取在最近几年内在按人口平均计算的肉类、奶类和油脂生产方面赶上并超过美国的大规模的全民运动和国内开展的社会主义竞赛表明，发展农业的七年计划的任务能够提前完成。
    苏共中央全会认为，最重要的任务是把谷物的生产至少提高到年产一百亿到一百一十亿普特，以便为形成稳定的商品谷物资源创造现实的可能性。为此，决定通过开垦荒地和提高耕作水平来扩大谷类作物的播种面积。
    决议中建议地方组织采取措施扩大耕地面积和提高甜菜、棉花和其它技术作物的单位面积产量。
    决议指出，由于农村中展开了社会主义竞赛，可以确信，七年计划中肉类生产的任务（一千六百万吨）将于1963年提前完成。
    苏共中央全会认为，为了完成在按人口平均计算的肉类生产方面赶上美国的任务，必须达到年产两千万到两千一百万吨肉。全会号召全体农业工作人员超额完成七年计划的任务，多生产四百万吨到五百万吨肉。
    决议建议每个区、集体农庄和国营农场拟定出提前完成七年计划任务的措施。特别应该注意保证完成和超额完成七年计划第二年——1960年增加农产品生产的任务。
    中央全会决议赞同关于降低集体农庄的籽棉、茶叶、瓜类、葡萄、水果和羊毛的生产成本的建议和降低集体农庄出售给国家的某些农产品的收购价格的建议。这样一来，这些价格将接近国营农场产品的交售价格，这就有可能进一步降低消费品的国家零售价格和进一步提高苏联人民的物质生活水平。
    根据公有经济目前的发展水平，中央全会认为按照各集体农庄庄员大会的决议增加现金收入中的公积金提成是适宜的。这种现金首先应该用来购买机器和设备，用来建筑和进行其它保证迅速提高集体农庄经济的设施，并用来为集体农民建筑分期付款的住宅。
    全会责成苏共中央委员会主席团在改组农业机构工作的同时研究并讨论成立集体农庄联合机构的意见。决议指出，进一步提高农业的任务要求改变集体农庄领导的组织形式，以利于进一步发扬集体农庄的民主。
    中央全会认为，农业科学的最重要的任务是，在更充分地利用生物学、物理学、化学和其他保证提高生产力和不断改进农业技术的有关科学的最新成就的基础上，开展理论研究工作。
    决议指出，把经济上落后的集体农庄提高到先进的集体农庄的水平具有十分重大的意义。做到这一步的关键性条件是给这些单位配备有经验的、技术熟练的干部。
    中央全会确定了在农业生产中实行进一步全面机械化的措施。
    中央全会满意地指出，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会（1959年1月—2月）以后这一时期，苏联在工农业发展方面、在人民物质福利的提高方面和在实现苏维埃国家的和平外交政策方面都取得了巨大的新成就。
    今年头十一个月工业生产计划超额完成了，超计划生产了四百亿卢布的工业品。这一时期的工业生产比去年同期增长了11.3％，而计划规定是增长7.7％。
    中央全会决议认为，七年计划第一年的工作总结表明，苏联的工业正以比七年计划的控制数字更高的速度发展着。
    在工业和建筑业中加速技术进步的计划正在顺利实现。
    1959年取得的成就使得有可能在七年计划第二年的国民经济发展计划中确定大大超过原定的1960年控制数字的工业生产水平。
    决议指出，集体农庄和国营农场超额完成了1959年的春播作物的播种计划。今年农作物的总播种面积为一亿九千六百万公顷，即比1953年增加差不多四千万公顷。
    虽然国内许多大的谷物产区天旱，但是今年国家仍然收购了足够的粮食。
    集体农庄和国营农场的肉类生产在十一个月期间增长了32％，奶类增长了15％，蛋类增长了25％，羊毛增长了11％。
    中央全会决议指出，1959年，苏联将生产六千二百万吨奶类，即将超过美国奶类的总产量五百多万吨。
    今年，油脂的生产为八十四万五千吨，即按人口平均计算为四公斤。这超过了美国按人口平均计算的油脂生产，美国今年的油脂生产按人口平均计算约为三点七公斤。
    苏共中央全会的决议说，先进单位和先进人物的经验和他们在增加农产品生产方面的成就使人深信，每个集体农庄和国营农场，每个州和共和国都能顺利完成七年计划的任务，并实现提前完成这一任务的保证。
    全会号召农业工作者、全体劳动人民、各级党组织、苏维埃、工会和共青团组织发挥创造性来实现提前完成七年计划的任务并生产丰富的农产品的社会主义保证，为争取在苏联建成共产主义的全民斗争事业作出应有的贡献。
