I recently visited a *xika* (manor) near Lhasa belonging to Lhalu Tsewang Dorje, a rebel chieftain and big serf owner. This is just a small *xika* among Lhalu's twenty-odd *xika* and nearly ten pastures. The life of the serfs in this *xika* illustrates the deep suffering that the cannibalistic serf system in Tibet brought to the people and how urgently the serfs demanded democratic reform.

In this *xika*, there is a building where Lhalu Tsewang Dorje would escape the summer heat. The building has twenty rooms and a garage, with a large lawn and a stream outside. Although Lhalu only lived there for a few days after the house was built, the interior is filled with countless precious and luxurious utensils and food. This building was constructed by serfs drawn from this and other *xika* by Lhalu through unpaid labor. The serfs who came to build this building not only received no wages, but also had to bring their own food and tools. Only a few serfs who knew carpentry and stonemasonry received a little *tsampa* each day, barely enough to fill their stomachs.

This *xika* has fifteen *chaba* households and seventeen *duiqiong* households. Lhalu has a "xidui" (manor manager) and a "lieben" specifically to supervise the labor of the serfs in the *xika*. The fifteen *chaba* households have been Lhalu's serfs for generations. Although most of the seventeen *duiqiong* households do not belong to Lhalu, nor do they cultivate the land of this *xika*, they all have their own lords, some belonging to Drepung Monastery, some belonging to the former Tibetan local government, and some belonging to the traitor Yu Tu Tashi Dondrup. They must pay head tax and bear certain corvée labor to their respective lords every year.

Let's look at the situation of the serfs being exploited by corvée labor, rent, and usury from this small *xika*: Corvée labor is divided into internal and external corvée. Internal corvée is the corvée labor that serfs provide to their respective lords; external corvée is the corvée labor that is provided to the former Tibetan local government. The external corvée was originally supposed to be borne by the serf owners who owned the land, but the serf owners transferred the external corvée to the serfs by allocating a small amount of land to them for cultivation. The fifteen *chaba* households in Lhalu's *xika* were allocated a total of only 325 *ke* of land by the *xika*, but in terms of internal corvée, they had to provide as many as sixteen and a half regular *ula* (corvée), that is, sixteen and a half people (one person goes to serve in the *xika* every other day, called half an *ula*) to work on the *xika*'s own land all year round and serve all kinds of chores for the *xika*. Among the serfs who serve *ula* in this *xika*, there are 57-year-old elderly people and 15-year-old children. One of them, named Luo Bu, has been serving *ula* for Lhalu in the *xika* for twelve years. The serfs who come to the *xika* to serve *ula* for Lhalu are in many ways in the same position as *langsheng* (house slaves). They work on the lord's own land, but they need to bring their own food and farm tools from home, and they sleep in the serf owner's yard or cowshed and stable at night. The serf owner stipulates that they cannot go back to their own homes, and even going back to get some *tsampa* requires the permission of the "xidui." Although their homes are near the *xika*, the farthest is only four or five hundred meters away. Among these men and women serfs who serve *ula*, some are already married. If they go back home to sleep for one night, they will be punished and have to pay a fine of half a tael of Tibetan silver to the *xika*, and sometimes they are even arbitrarily extorted.

In addition to the regular *ula*, there are many other corvée labor services that the serfs provide to the *xika* and the lord. The serfs have to build and whitewash houses for the lord, transport goods, and in spring and autumn, they have to work for the *xika* for several days without compensation, transporting fertilizer, seeds, firewood, grain, and harvesting crops, etc.

The *xika* has priority in the use of manpower and animal power. Once the busy farming season arrives, it mobilizes the manpower and animal power of the entire *xika* to serve the *xika*. From plowing and sowing to harvesting and threshing, the *xika* is always ahead of the serfs. Therefore, the serfs often have to postpone the cultivation of their own allocated land. The *tsampa* eaten by Lhalu's family is made by the serfs picking out good highland barley grains one by one, roasting them, grinding them into *tsampa*, and sending them there. The tools for making *tsampa* and the pockets for packing *tsampa* are all provided by the serfs themselves. There is also a kind of corvée labor called "Shushi," which occurs almost every summer. At that time, the highland barley has spiked but is not yet ripe, but Lhalu wants to eat this kind of highland barley, so all the serfs of the *xika* have to go out and continuously select and pick the highland barley spikes, cook them, and send them to his home in Lhasa.

The external corvée of the *chaba* is also very heavy. The items of external corvée they mentioned are really too numerous to remember. The amount of corvée is so much that a *chaba* can only stay at home for a maximum of half a year in the whole year, and even two-thirds of the time they have to be outside serving corvée. Tashi Dondrup is a *chaba* who cultivates fifteen *ke* of allocated land. In addition to providing a regular *ula* to the *xika* and the above-mentioned countless chores, the external corvée labor that he provided to the former local government alone included as many as twenty or thirty kinds, such as transporting butter, tea, leather, highland barley, charcoal, beef, mutton, wool, forage, etc. Each item required one person to go every year, each time for two to three days. There is a kind of corvée called "Suiru," which is to go to the Ranbala pasture of the former Tibetan local government to graze cattle and sheep. More than ten *chaba* households take turns sending one person each year to graze for twenty-two days. If the grazing is not done well, they will be beaten and scolded. In addition, there are delivering letters, building dikes, repairing bridges, etc., especially the letter-delivering corvée, which is rotated many times every year. Tashi Dondrup said: "It is impossible to say how much corvée you have to serve in a year. You have to go as soon as the corvée comes, regardless of whether there is work in your fields or not. Even if you are eating *tsampa*, you have to put down the bowl of water and serve the corvée."

In addition to cultivating the allocated land, most of the *chaba* also rent some land from the *xika* in the form of paying rent, and some of the *duiqiong* also rent part of the land. There are two kinds of land rentals: one is called "Boxin," which pays a fixed rent every year. The rent is one *ke* of rent for every *ke* of seeds sown, or slightly more, but most of this land is bad land, and very few serfs rent this kind of land. The other is called "Xiexin," which is the so-called profit-sharing land. The harvest is generally divided equally between the *xika* and the serfs. Most of the rented land in Lhalu's *xika* is "Xiexin" land. Since the seeds are not deducted when dividing the land, the serfs actually get much less than the lord, and the rent often reaches 70% to 80%. For example, the *chaba* Ciren cultivates six *ke* of "Xiexin" land. Last year, he harvested thirty *ke*. After dividing the land, he actually only got nine *ke* after deducting the seeds. 70% of the harvest was exploited by Lhalu. Another example is the *chaba* Dengzhu who cultivates eight and a half *ke* of "Xiexin" land. Last year, he harvested thirty *ke*. He gave fourteen *ke* to the *xika*. After deducting the seeds from his own portion, he only had seven and a half *ke*, and the rent reached 75%. Many serfs cannot bear such heavy corvée labor and cannot repay the increasing debts, so they have to flee to other places. During the reporter's visit, it was found that more than half of the fifteen *chaba* households in this *xika* were moved from other territories by Lhalu. Some came here one or twenty years ago, and some only a few years ago. The local old *chaba* all fled.

The serfs could not live, so they had to borrow from the lord. None of the *chaba* in Lhalu's *xika* are not in debt. The fifteen *chaba* households in the entire *xika* owe a total of 2,944 *ke* of highland barley and 553 *cheng* of Tibetan silver (each *cheng* is equivalent to 3.33 yuan). Thirteen of the seventeen *duiqiong* households are also in debt. In this debt figure of the *chaba*, a considerable part is not the principal but the interest that must be paid to the creditor every year. How much they borrowed in the past, how much they paid back including principal and interest, has become impossible to figure out. About half (seven households) of the *chaba* in the entire *xika* owe the so-called "debt for repayment of interest." These debts were all transferred to the *chaba* who had not fled by the creditors after the debtors fled, and they were forced to repay them. Some serfs talked about the situation of creditors forcing debts in the past, saying: Every autumn, when the grain has not yet been harvested, the creditors send people to urge the debt. If the crops in that field are good, they put a mud brick on the ground, and the brick is covered with a big seal. The serfs cannot harvest until the creditors come. Some old serfs said that no matter day or night, as long as the bell (the horse ridden by the debt collector has a bell tied around its neck) rings, almost nine out of ten houses are empty, and everyone rushes to hide.

According to the survey, only two or three of the thirty-two serf households in Lhalu's *xika* have enough grain to eat every year. The vast majority of households lack grain. After paying land rent and repaying high-interest loans, ordinary serfs can only maintain their lives for two or three months. Several households paid off all their debts with the seeds after the grain was harvested. Ciren, a member of the suppression of the rebellion and production committee of this *xika*, told reporters that if the military control committee had not issued interest-free agricultural loans this spring, a large amount of land would have been abandoned. In the ten or so serf households that the reporter visited, he personally saw that seven or eight families were eating pea *tsampa* and drinking plain tea, without any butter at all. The life of the *duiqiong* is even more difficult. Most of them are scantily clad, suffering from hunger and cold, and cannot even afford pea *tsampa*. They spend most of the year begging. In contrast, the nine dairy cows and three dogs of the *xika* are specially fed by serfs who serve *ula*, and they eat the best highland barley *tsampa* every day.

After the suppression of the rebellion launched by the rebel leader Lhalu and other reactionary big serf owners, the serfs here urgently demanded democratic reform. They said: "Dark clouds can't cover the sun forever. After the rain, the sky will always clear. The Communist Party is the sun for the poor, shining on us forever!" Before the rebellion was suppressed, an old mother here was already dying of illness. She often said to her fourteen-year-old daughter Gesang Duojie: "We owe so much debt, how will you repay it after I die?" Just as the old mother and Gesang Duojie were infinitely worried, the rebellion was suppressed, and the work team of the military control committee came. When this fourteen-year-old girl learned that the serf system was about to be abolished, she quickly ran back and told her old mother: "Ama, you can't die now! The sun of happiness is rising." In the rural areas near Lhalu's *xika*, the serfs recently sang a song they composed themselves: "Dig out the roots of poverty, plant the roots of wealth, our sun of happiness rises high."

    在叛乱头子拉鲁的一个庄园里
    新华社记者　袁定乾
    记者最近访问了叛乱头子、大农奴主拉鲁·策旺多吉在拉萨附近的一个溪卡（庄园）。这里只是拉鲁二十多个溪卡和近十个牧场中的一个小溪卡。这个溪卡里农奴的生活说明，西藏吃人的农奴制度给人民带来了多么深重的苦难，以及农奴是怎样迫切地要求进行民主改革。
    这个溪卡里有一幢楼房，是拉鲁·策旺多吉避暑的地方。楼房有二十间房间和汽车房，室外有宽大的草坪和一条溪水。虽然拉鲁在房屋修成后总共不过住了几天，但室内却存放着无数珍贵豪华的用具和食品。这座楼房就是拉鲁从当地和其他溪卡中抽调农奴用无偿劳役建成的，来建筑这座楼房的农奴不仅没有工资，连食物和工具都要从家中带来，只有几个会木工和石工的农奴，每天才领到一点仅能充饥的糌粑。
    这个溪卡有十五户差巴和十七户堆穷，拉鲁在溪卡里设有一个“溪堆”（庄园管理人）和一个“列本”专门监督农奴劳动。十五户差巴世世代代都是拉鲁的农奴，十七户堆穷虽然多数不属于拉鲁，也没有耕种这个溪卡的土地，但是他们都有自己的领主，有的属于哲蚌寺，有的属于原西藏地方政府，有的属于叛国头子宇妥·扎西顿珠，他们每年要分别向自己的领主缴纳人头税和担负一定的差役。
    请从这个小溪卡来看农奴受到差役、租税、高利贷压榨的情况：差役分内差和外差两种，内差是农奴向各自领主支的差；外差则是向原西藏地方政府支的差。外差本来应由领有土地的农奴主支应的，而农奴主却以少数分地给农奴耕种，把外差也转嫁到农奴的身上。拉鲁这个溪卡的十五户差巴，溪卡给他们分地总共只有三百二十五克，但他们在内差方面，仅向溪卡支的常年乌拉（差役）就有十六个半，即要派出十六个半人（隔一天去一人为溪卡服役，叫做半个乌拉）终年在溪卡的自营地上劳动和为溪卡服一切杂役。在这个溪卡担任乌拉的农奴中，有五十七岁的老人，也有十五岁的孩子，其中一个叫罗布的农奴已经在溪卡里为拉鲁服了十二年乌拉。到溪卡里为拉鲁服乌拉的农奴，很多方面同朗生（家奴）处在同等的地位。他们在领主的自营地上劳动，但需从家中自带食物和农具，晚上就露宿在农奴主的院内或牛棚马棚里，农奴主规定他们不能回自己家里去住，连回去取点糌粑也要取得“溪堆”的允许，虽然他们的家就在溪卡附近，最远也不过相距四、五百公尺。在这些服乌拉的男女农奴中，有些已经结了婚，他们回到家里睡上一夜，就得受处罚，还要向溪卡缴纳半两藏银的罚金，有时甚至被任意敲诈。
    除了常年乌拉外，农奴向溪卡和领主支的差还有很多，农奴要为领主修建、粉刷房屋，运送物品，春季和秋季还要为溪卡无偿劳动若干天，运送肥料、种子、柴草、粮食和收割庄稼等等。
    溪卡在使用人力、畜力上都享有优先权，一到农忙，就把全溪卡的人力、畜力动用起来为溪卡服役，从耕作、播种至收割、打场，溪卡没有一样不在农奴之前，因此，农奴常常不得不推迟自己分地的耕作。拉鲁家里吃的糌粑，是由农奴一粒一粒选出好的青稞，炒好和磨成糌粑后送去的，做糌粑的工具，装糌粑的口袋，都由农奴自备。还有一种叫做“暑十”的差，几乎每年夏天都有，那时青稞抽穗后尚未成熟，而拉鲁却要吃这种青稞，于是全溪卡的农奴都要出动，连续几天选摘青稞穗，煮熟后送到他在拉萨的家里去。
    差巴的外差也是很繁重的，他们讲出的外差名目，实在记不胜记，出差之多，使一个差巴全年最多只有半年时间耽在家里，甚至有三分之二的时间要在外面支差。扎西顿珠是一户耕种十五克分地的差巴，他除了要向溪卡支一个常年乌拉和上述无数杂役，外差方面仅向原地方政府支的运输差一项，其名目就达二、三十种，如运酥油、茶叶、皮革、青稞、木炭、牛羊肉、羊毛、草料等等，每年每样要去一人，每次二至三天。有一种叫“绥茹”的差，是到原西藏地方政府然巴拉牧场去放牧牛羊，十多户差巴，每年轮流派一人去放牧二十二天，放牧得稍微不好就要挨打受骂。此外，还有送信、筑堤、修桥等等，尤其是送信差，每年要轮到很多次。扎西顿珠说：“一年究竟要出多少差，说也说不清，差一来就得去，根本不管你地里有活没活，那怕你正在吃糌粑，也得把水碗放下去支差。”
    这里的差巴除种分地外，多数还以缴纳地租的形式租种溪卡的一些土地，有些堆穷也租种部分土地。租地有两种：一种叫做“波辛”，每年缴纳定额租，租额是每一克种子的地交租一克或稍多一点，但这种土地多数是坏地，农奴租到这种土地的也很少；另一种叫做“协辛”，即所谓分益地，收获一般是溪卡和农奴对分。拉鲁溪卡的租地大部分是“协辛”地，由于对分时不扣除种子，农奴实际得到的比领主少得多，租额往往高达70％到80％。如差巴慈尼种“协辛”地六克，去年收获三十克，对分后自己除去种子实际只得到九克，收获量的70％被拉鲁剥削去。又如差巴登珠种“协辛”地八克半，去年收获三十克，给溪卡十四克，自得部分扣除种子只有七克半，租额达75％。许多农奴受不了这样繁重的差役、偿不清越来越多的债务，不得不逃亡他乡。记者在访问时发现，这个溪卡的十五户差巴中，一半以上是拉鲁从其他领地迁来的，有的来此一、二十年，有的只有几年，当地的老差巴都逃亡了。
    农奴们无法生活，不得不向领主告贷，拉鲁溪卡里的这些差巴没有一户不负债，全溪卡十五户差巴总共负债青稞二千九百四十四克，藏银五百五十三秤（每秤合三元三角三分）。十七户堆穷也有十三户负债。差巴的这个欠债数字中，有相当大一部分不是本而是每年固定要向债主交的利息，他们过去究竟借了多少，连本带息还了多少，已经无法弄清。全溪卡约有一半（七户）差巴负有所谓“代还息”的债务，这些债务都是债户逃亡后，债主强迫把债务转嫁到未逃亡的差巴身上，由他们来归还。一些农奴谈起过去债主逼债的情形说：每年秋天，当粮食还没收割时，债主就派人来催债了，那块地的庄稼好，就在地里放上一块土坯，土坯上盖上个大印，农奴不等到债主来时就不能收割，一些老农奴说，无论白天夜间，只要铃铛（收债人骑的马脖子上系有铃铛）一响，几乎十室九空，大家都争先躲藏起来。
    据调查，拉鲁这个溪卡的三十二户农奴，每年粮食够吃的只有两三户，缺粮户占到绝大多数，一般农奴在缴纳地租和偿还高利贷利息后，只能维持两三个月的生活，有几户人家粮食一收下连种子也全部还了债。这个溪卡的平叛生产委员会委员次仁对记者说，今年春耕时如果不是军管会发给了无息农贷，将要荒废大量的土地。在记者访问过的十多家农奴中，亲眼看到有七、八家吃的是豌豆糌粑，喝的是清茶，根本没有酥油。堆穷的生活更是困苦，他们多数衣不蔽体、忍饥挨饿，连豌豆糌粑也吃不上，一年大部分时间靠乞讨度日。与此相反，溪卡的九头奶牛和三条狗，却专门有出乌拉的农奴喂养，每天吃着上好的青稞糌粑。
    叛匪头子拉鲁和其他反动大农奴主发动的叛乱平息后，这里的农奴就迫切要求进行民主改革，他们说：“乌云终究遮不住太阳，雨过总是要天晴的，共产党是穷人的太阳，永远照耀着我们！”叛乱平息前这里有一个老妈妈已经病得快死了，她经常对十四岁的女儿格桑多杰说：“欠下这样多的债，我死后你们怎么还？”老妈妈和格桑多杰正无限忧虑的时候，叛乱平息了，军管会的工作队来了，当这个十四岁的姑娘知道农奴制度将要废除后，她赶快跑回去告诉老妈妈说：“阿妈啦，现在你可不能死呀！幸福的太阳出来了。”在拉鲁溪卡附近的农村里，最近农奴们唱着一首自己编的歌：“挖掉穷根，栽上富根，我们的幸福太阳高升。”（附图片）
