    Middle School Students Must Study Well
    Zhang Luo
    From the perspective of school education stages, middle school connects primary school and university. Many young people enter middle school after graduating from primary school. After graduating from middle school, many young people go on to university. This stage of education must be well-arranged.
    Teenagers are eager to receive a good middle school education. If the quality of primary school graduates is good, then middle schools can further improve their quality. If the quality of primary school graduates is not very good, middle schools should work harder to improve their quality. If middle schools are not run ideally, it is possible that the quality of high-quality primary school graduates may be relatively reduced, while those students with poor quality cannot get the improvement they deserve. Therefore, middle schools must organize students' study life well and, based on their ideological situation, guide them to work hard to master knowledge.
    The courses taught in middle school are all basic courses, which are a further deepening and expansion on the basis of primary school education. Most students study hard. However, there are also a very few students who think that since there are more admissions to universities now and it is easier to get in, they do not put in hard work in their studies. They should know that studying well is not just for getting into university. Going to college is not the ultimate goal of students; it is just to further train how to become useful talents for building the motherland. Middle school students must lay a good foundation today for further studies tomorrow. It should be understood that the improvement of the quality of university teaching is inseparable from the quality of middle school graduates. Universities undertake the task of improvement and demand improvement every day. If middle school students do not have a sufficient foundation, they will encounter great difficulties in their studies and may even fall behind. It will be of great benefit for middle school students to study basic courses well and then go to university (junior high school graduates go to high school or vocational school) for education.
    Of course, a large proportion of middle school graduates, especially junior high school graduates, will not be able to go on to higher education and will go to construction jobs relatively early in order to adapt to the needs of socialist construction. If they can truly master certain basic knowledge, they will also be able to improve in their work. If they "do not study hard when young," they will deeply feel "it is too late to regret not having studied when the time comes to use it!"
    In any case, middle school students must study well and must master basic knowledge well. Teachers must also guide students to learn basic knowledge well. Although middle school students have a certain degree of self-study ability and are beginning to be able to think independently, they still need teacher guidance. The teacher's guidance to middle school students is mainly to further deepen their basic knowledge and carry out creative learning. Some middle schools require middle school students to be creative in scientific research, and, like universities, propose to combine teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, which is clearly demanding too much.
    Middle school days are truly the golden age of life, truly "every inch of time is worth an inch of gold." Middle school students must cherish time, consciously strive for a triple harvest of reading, thinking, and labor, and truly study well.

    中学生要学习好
    张罗
    从学校教育的阶段来说，中学衔接着小学和大学。小学生毕业了，许多少年要进中学来。中学生在中学毕业了，不少青年又要进大学去。这一阶段的教育工作必须好好安排。
    青少年都热忱地希望受到良好的中学教育。如果小学毕业生的质量很好，那末，中学就可以更好地提高他们的质量。如果小学毕业生的质量不怎么好，中学就应当更加努力提高他们的质量。中学要是办得不够理想，那末，就有可能使质量高的小学毕业生相对地降低质量，而那些质量差的学生又不能获得应有的提高。所以，中学必须很好地组织学生的学习生活，并且根据他们的思想情况，诱导他们去努力掌握知识。
    中学所讲授的，都是基础课程，是在小学教育基础上的进一步深化和扩大。大部分学生是努力学习的。可是，也有极少数的学生认为，现在高等学校招生多了，考取容易了，于是在学习上就不大下艰苦的功夫了。他们应当知道，学习得好并不只是为了考上高等学校。升学并不是学生的最终目的，升学只是为了进一步锻炼怎样做建设祖国的有用人材。中学生为了明天的进一步深造，就必须在今天打好基础。要知道，高等学校教学质量的提高，是同中学毕业生的质量分不开的。高等学校担负着提高的任务，逐日要求提高。如果中学生没有足够的基础，就会在学习中碰到很大的困难，甚至赶不上队。中学生学好了基础课，到大学（初中毕业生到高中或专业学校）去受教育，将会有很大好处。
    当然，有很大一部分中学毕业生，特别是初中毕业生，为了适应社会主义建设的需要，不能升学，要比较早地走上建设岗位。如果他们能够真正掌握一定的基础知识，也就能够在工作中提高。如果“少小不努力”，到那时是会深切地感到“书到用时方恨少”的！
    无论从哪方面来讲，中学生必须学好，必须学好基础知识。教师也必须指导学生学好基础知识。中学生虽然具有一定程度的自学能力，开始能够独立思考，但还需要教师辅导。教师对中学生的辅导，主要是进一步加深他们的基础知识，进行创造性的学习。有的中学，要求中学生要在科学研究上有所创造，也同高等学校一样，提出把教学、生产劳动、科学研究结合起来，这显然是要求过高了。
    中学生时代，真是人生的黄金时代，真是“一寸光阴一寸金”。中学生可得要珍惜时间，自觉地争取读书、思想、劳动三丰收，真正学习好。
