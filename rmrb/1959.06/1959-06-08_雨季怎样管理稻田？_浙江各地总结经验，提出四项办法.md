How to Manage Rice Paddies in the Rainy Season?
Zhejiang Summarizes Experiences and Proposes Four Measures

    Hangzhou, 7th (Our Newspaper) – The early rice (including mid-season rice) in Zhejiang Province has basically been transplanted. Currently, more than 2.4 million laborers are投入committed to early rice field management, focusing on harrowing, weeding, topdressing, and pest and disease control.

    After Huangyan County mobilized the masses to vigorously conduct field inspections, a high tide of field management quickly formed. During field inspections, they focused on inspecting three types of seedlings, implemented field consultations, analyzed the causes, and prescribed the right remedies. While conducting field inspections, Huangyan County also vigorously engaged in a shock campaign to accumulate and create fertilizer, ensuring that every field had a fertilizer pit and every team had a soil fertilizer factory, vigorously producing soil fertilizer.

    In strengthening field management, Pujiang County established field management headquarters from top to bottom. The county party committee secretary and members in charge of agriculture went to the communes to lead production, and the cadres of the communes, brigades, and production teams also went to the masses to participate in production and lead production, ensuring that they grasped both harvesting and planting, as well as management; they grasped both production and life, so field management was done quickly and well.

    At farmers' forums held in many areas, the issue of how to weed and fertilize during the plum rain season was also widely studied. Various places have summarized four measures for weeding and fertilizing on rainy days: First, shallow and frequent irrigation: the more it rains, the shallower the irrigation should be; full water makes the rice cold and unable to grow. Second, seize the opportunity to apply topdressing on cloudy days, light rainy days, and during breaks in the rain. Weeding should be done while fertilizing to reduce fertilizer loss. Third, early weeding, tight weeding, and meticulous weeding. Weeding should not stop in light rain, should be carried out during cloudy days, and should be supplemented on sunny days, more than normal weather. Fourth, for fields with poor early rice growth, gypsum and alum should be applied quickly to promote the decomposition of base fertilizer or increase the application of human manure. These four experiences have a great guiding role for current field management work.

    While strengthening early rice field management, various places are also making early preparations for pest and disease prevention and control. Most counties have established special pest and disease prevention and control headquarters. (Wu Zhaoxiang)

    雨季怎样管理稻田？
    浙江各地总结经验，提出四项办法
    本报杭州7日电　浙江省的早稻（包括中稻）已基本上插种完毕，目前，每天有二百四十多万劳动大军投入了以耙田、耘田、追肥、防治病虫害为中心的早稻田间管理工作。
    黄岩县发动群众大抓田间检查后，很快就形成了田间管理的高潮。他们在田间检查中以查看三类苗为中心，实行田头会诊，分析原因，对症下药。在田间检查的同时，黄岩县又大搞突击积肥、造肥，做到丘丘田头有沤肥坑，队队有土化肥厂，大搞土化肥生产。
    浦江县在加强田间管理中，从上而下都建立了田间管理指挥部，县委管农业的书记和委员分头深入公社领导生产，各公社、大队、生产队的干部，也深入到群众中一起参加生产，领导生产，做到既抓收种，又抓管理；既抓生产，又抓生活，因此田间管理做得又快又好。
    在许多地区召开的农民座谈会上，还普遍研究了在黄霉多雨季节如何进行耘田施肥的问题。各地总结出阴雨天耘田施肥的四条措施：一、浅灌勤灌：越是雨天越要浅灌，水满发冷就不发棵。二、抢阴天、小雨天和雨停间歇抢施追肥。随施随耘田，减少肥料流失。三、早耘、紧耘、精耘。做到小雨不停耘，阴天突击耘，晴天补耘，要比正常天气多耘一次。四、早稻生长不良的田，要抢施石膏、明矾，促使底肥分解或增加施人粪。这四条经验，对当前田间管理工作指导作用很大。
    各地在加强早稻田间管理的同时，还及早做好防治病虫害工作，大部分县都已专门成立了防治病虫害指挥部。　（吴兆祥）
