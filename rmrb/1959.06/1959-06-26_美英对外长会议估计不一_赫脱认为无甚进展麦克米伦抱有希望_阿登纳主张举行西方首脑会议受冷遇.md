Differing Estimates of the US-British Foreign Ministers' Meeting
    Herter Believes Little Progress Was Made, Macmillan Remains Hopeful
    Adenauer's Proposal for a Western Summit Meeting Meets with a Cold Reception
    (Reported by this newspaper) US Secretary of State Herter delivered a radio and television address on June 23, reporting to the nation on the situation of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    Herter said that the Geneva conference "did not achieve significant progress" in resolving the issues of Germany and Berlin. Subsequently, he tried his best to distort the sincerity and efforts of the Soviet Union at the conference in seeking a solution to the German peace treaty issue and the Berlin issue, insisting that the Soviet Union "did not show that it was interested in conducting genuine negotiations," attempting to shift the responsibility for the conference's failure to achieve significant progress onto the Soviet Union. In his speech, Herter once again defended the so-called Western occupation rights in West Berlin and opposed the Soviet proposal to make West Berlin a free city. He stated that the "decisive" issue was the Soviet Union's agreement that West Berlin would be under "Western protection," otherwise, the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference would not reach an agreement. Regarding a summit meeting, Herter still said that if a summit meeting was to have any hope of success, "a certain degree of progress must be made at the Geneva conference." However, he also believed that "no such progress has yet appeared at the Geneva conference."

    On the same day, British Prime Minister Macmillan also spoke in the British House of Commons about his assessment and hopes for the Geneva conference. In response to a question from Labor MP Healey, he said: "It would be wrong to underestimate the extent of the achievements that have already been made at the Foreign Ministers' Conference." Macmillan believed that although the foreign ministers of the East and West did not reach an agreement, "there is no doubt that the attitudes of both sides have been further clarified, and in some respects, they are closer." He hoped that the Geneva conference would achieve further progress after the resumption of the session and "lead to a meeting of heads of government."

    On June 24, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd reported to the British House of Commons on the situation of the Geneva conference. He believed that the adjournment of the Foreign Ministers' Conference "is not a breakdown in negotiations, but merely an intermission." He also hoped that the resumption of the Geneva conference would "lead to the convening of a summit conference." At the same time, Lloyd defended the various Western proposals at the conference aimed at continuing the occupation of West Berlin.

    Western news agencies, in reporting the speeches of the US and British leaders, noted the differences in their estimates of the Geneva conference. Reuters believed that Herter's "hopes" for the Geneva conference were not as "great" as Macmillan's. His "estimate" of the possibility of the West reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union after the resumption of the Foreign Ministers' Conference "tended to be pessimistic."

    At the same time, the Associated Press also reported that, contrary to the British attitude, some West German and American authorities had expressed some doubts "as to whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference would actually resume" as scheduled "to continue seeking a solution to the Berlin issue." Due to differing views on the Geneva conference, the Associated Press said that consultations would be held between Western countries in order to "reunify Western policies on West Berlin, Germany, disarmament, and summit meetings."

    A few days ago, West German Chancellor Adenauer, in an interview with American journalist Taylor, advocated holding a summit conference of Western countries in Washington to remedy the "rift" between them. However, a British Foreign Office spokesman said on June 24: "British leaders have no intention of attending such a meeting in London or elsewhere between now and July 13, when the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference resumes." At the same time, according to Agence France-Presse, British "authoritative sources" also said that there was "no need to hold a Western summit conference or foreign ministers' conference" at present. In this situation, Adenauer has abandoned his proposal to convene a Western summit meeting. According to an Associated Press report on the 24th, West German Press Office Director Eckart said at a press conference that it now appeared "impossible" to hold a Western summit meeting before the resumption of the Geneva conference.

### 美英对外长会议估计不一  赫脱认为无甚进展麦克米伦抱有希望  阿登纳主张举行西方首脑会议受冷遇

    美英对外长会议估计不一
    赫脱认为无甚进展麦克米伦抱有希望
    阿登纳主张举行西方首脑会议受冷遇
    本报讯　美国国务卿赫脱在6月23日发表广播电视演说，向全国报告日内瓦外长会议的情况。
    赫脱说，日内瓦会议在解决德国和柏林问题上“没有取得重大的进展”，接着，他就竭力歪曲苏联在会上谋求解决对德和约问题和柏林问题的诚意和努力，硬说苏联“没有表明它有兴趣进行真正的谈判”，企图把会议没有取得重大进展的责任硬推到苏联身上。赫脱在演说中再一次为坚持西方在西柏林的所谓占领权进行辩护，并反对苏联为使西柏林成为自由城市的建议。他表示，“决定性”的问题是苏联同意西柏林处在“西方保护”之下，否则日内瓦外长会议就不会达成协议。在谈到最高级会议时，赫脱仍然说，如果要使最高级会议有获得成功的希望，“就必须在日内瓦会议上取得一定程度的进展。”但他又认为，“日内瓦会议上还没有出现这种进展。”
    同一天，英国首相麦克米伦也在英国下院中谈到了他对日内瓦会议的估计和希望。他在回答工党议员希利的问题时说：“如果低估在外长会议上已经取得的成就的程度，那是错误的。”麦克米伦认为，虽然东西方外长们并没有达成协议，“但是毫无疑问双方的态度进一步得到了澄清，在某些方面更靠近了一些。他希望日内瓦会议在复会以后，将能取得进一步的进展，并“将导致举行政府首脑会议”。
    6月24日，英国外交大臣劳埃德向英国下院报告日内瓦会议情况。他认为：外长会议的休会“并不是谈判的破裂，而仅仅是中间休息”。他也希望日内瓦会议复会后将能“导致政府首脑会议的召开。”同时，劳埃德又替西方在会议上提出的目的在于继续占领西柏林的各项建议进行辩护。
    西方通讯社在报道美、英两国领导人的讲话时，注意到了他们对于日内瓦会议的估计的差别。路透社认为，赫脱对日内瓦会议所抱的“希望”不像麦克米伦“那么大”。他对外长会议复会以后西方同苏联达成协议的可能性的“估计偏于悲观”。
    同时，美联社也报道说，同英国的态度相反，一些西德和美国的权威人士已经表示有些怀疑，“外长会议究竟是否会真正像安排的那样”复会“以继续谋求一个解决柏林问题的办法。”由于对日内瓦会议的看法不一，美联社说，西方国家之间将要进行磋商，以便“重新统一西方对西柏林、德国、裁军和最高级会议的政策”。
    前几天，西德总理阿登纳在接见美国记者泰勒时曾经主张在华盛顿举行西方国家首脑会议来弥补它们之间的“裂痕”。但是，英国外交部发言人在6月24日表示：“英国领袖无意在从现在到7月13日日内瓦外长会议复会期间在伦敦或其他地方参加这样一次会议。”同时根据法新社报道，英国“权威人士”也说，在目前“没有必要举行西方政府首脑会议或外长会议”。在这种情况下，阿登纳已放弃他的召开西方最高级会议的主张。据美联社24日报道，西德新闻局长埃卡特在记者招待会上说，现在看来在日内瓦会议复会以前举行西方最高级会议“是不可能的”。
