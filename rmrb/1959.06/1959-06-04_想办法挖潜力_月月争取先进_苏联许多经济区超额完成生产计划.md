Moscow, June 3rd (By Our Correspondent) The Seven-Year Plan, symbolizing a new stage in Soviet communist construction, has been implemented for five months. During these five months, the Soviet working class has engaged in intense, creative labor, finding ways, tapping potential, improving production equipment, striving for automation and mechanization, and making every effort to increase productivity. Completing the production targets for the first half of this year as stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan is a very important task. The working people of the fifteen Soviet republics, at the close of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, put forward the slogan of completing the production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. Now good news is frequently coming from all parts of the Soviet Union. Many factories have completed the five-month production plan ahead of schedule and have proposed guarantees to complete the production tasks for the first half of the year before the opening of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee on June 24.

The industrial sector of the Kazakh Republic was the first to send good news to the people of the whole Soviet Union. The industrial production units of this republic completed the five-month production plan ahead of schedule on May 25. The total industrial output of the entire republic increased by 14% compared with the same period last year. It is estimated that by the end of the month, the republic can produce tens of millions of rubles more products for the state.

Following the Kazakh Republic, the Uzbek Republic and the Estonian Republic also reported good news to the country, completing the five-month production plan six days ahead of schedule.

The Zaporozhye National Economic Zone of Ukraine also completed the three-month production plan ahead of schedule on May 24. It is estimated that by the end of the month, the total industrial output will increase by 18% compared with the same period last year. Now the workers in this national economic zone have launched a labor emulation campaign to strive for the early completion of the production plan for the first half of the year. Many "Communist Labor Teams" have put forward guarantees to greet the first plenary session of the Party Central Committee after the 21st Congress of the CPSU with outstanding labor achievements.

The Sakhalin National Economic Zone, far away on the Pacific coast, also completed the five-month production plan on May 23. Among them, the heroic labor of the lumberjacks has achieved particularly outstanding results. They have now completed the production tasks for the first half of the year. The logging volume in the first five months of this year was 10% more than the original plan. In addition, due to the adoption of advanced working methods, the country saved 13 million rubles in funds in the first quarter alone.

The Kiev, Kharkov, Samarkand, and Gorky National Economic Zones have also completed the five-month production plan ahead of schedule.

    想办法挖潜力　月月争取先进
    苏联许多经济区超额完成生产计划
    本报莫斯科3日电　象征着苏联共产主义建设新阶段的七年计划已经实行五个月了。这五个月里，苏联工人阶级进行了紧张的创造性的劳动，想办法，挖潜力，改进生产设备，力争实现自动化、机械化，千方百计提高生产率。完成七年计划中规定的今年上半年的生产指标是一件非常重要的任务。苏联十五个加盟共和国的劳动人民，还在苏共第二十一次代表大会闭幕的时候，便提出了提早完成上半年生产计划的口号。现在捷报从苏联各地频频传来，许多工厂提前完成了五个月的生产计划，并且提出在6月24日，苏共中央全会开幕以前，完成上半年生产任务的保证。
    哈萨克共和国的工业部门，首先向全苏人民发出了喜信，这个共和国的工业生产单位在5月25日提前完成了五个月的生产计划，全共和国工业生产总额比去年同一时期增加了14％，预计到月底时可以为国家多生产数千万卢布的产品。
    继哈萨克共和国之后，乌兹别克共和国和爱沙尼亚共和国也向全国报捷，这两个共和国提前六天完成五个月的生产计划。
    乌克兰札波罗什国民经济区也在5月24日提前完成了三个月的生产计划，预计到月底时工业生产总额将比去年同一时期增加18％。现在这个国民经济区的工人们已经展开了争取提前完成上半年生产计划的劳动竞赛，许多“共产主义劳动队”都纷纷提出保证，一定要用优秀的劳动成绩迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会后党中央的第一次全会。
    远在太平洋沿岸的库页岛国民经济区，也在5月23日完成了五个月的生产计划，其中，伐木工人的英勇劳动取得了特别突出的成绩，他们现在已经完成了上半年的生产任务，今年前五个月的伐木量比原计划多10％，另外由于采用先进工作法，仅在第一季度就为国家节省了一千三百万卢布资金。
    提前完成了五个月生产计划的还有基辅、哈尔科夫、萨马尔罕、高尔基等国民经济区。
