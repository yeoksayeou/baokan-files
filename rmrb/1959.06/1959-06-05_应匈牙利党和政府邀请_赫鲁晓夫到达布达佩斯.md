Marshal Malinovsky, the Soviet Minister of Defense, accompanied Khrushchev.

　　Hungarian party and government leaders Kadar, Münnich, Marosan, ministers of the government, and heads of social organizations went to the airport to greet them.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 4th: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and Soviet Minister of Defense, Marshal Malinovsky, left Tirana this morning by special plane for Budapest.

　　Albanian party and government leaders such as Hoxha, Shehu, and Leshi, as well as over ten thousand working people from Tirana, went to the airport to see them off.

　　In his speech at the airport, Khrushchev expressed his gratitude for the warm reception from the Albanian people.

　　Khrushchev said, "We are full of confidence in the bright future of the Albanian people. Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian people have established their free and independent country, and are now confidently advancing on the road of building socialism and communism. This is the only correct and most reliable road."

　　Khrushchev said, "In the fraternal family of socialist countries, we will help each other, advance side by side, develop our economies, and continuously increase the material welfare of the people."

　　Khrushchev said, "I often hear the saying that Albania is a small country and it does not border its allies in the socialist camp. I think this is not important now." Khrushchev pointed out, "Although Albania is not a large country, it has joined the big family of the socialist camp and the family of the Warsaw Treaty countries. Therefore, the Albanian people can be confident that the Soviet Union and other fraternal socialist countries will not let it suffer disaster. If aggressive forces attempt to infringe on Albania's independence, we will work together to prevent aggression, and if aggression occurs, we will severely punish the aggressors."

　　The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Hoxha, also spoke. He said that the days of the visit of the Soviet party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev to Albania have become a solemn and powerful expression of the fraternal friendship between our two peoples; these days have left a deep impression in the hearts of all Albanian people.

　　In his speech, Hoxha expressed his sincere gratitude for the selfless assistance of the Soviet people. He said that this assistance is of decisive significance for Albania's independent development and its prosperity as a socialist country.

    应匈牙利党和政府邀请
    赫鲁晓夫到达布达佩斯
    新华社布达佩斯4日电苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，应匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利政府的邀请，于今天从阿尔巴尼亚乘飞机抵达布达佩斯。随同赫鲁晓夫前来的还有苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅。
    匈牙利党政领导人卡达尔、明尼赫、马罗山以及政府各部部长、各社会团体的负责人等前往机场迎接。
    新华社地拉那4日电苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅今天上午乘专机离开地拉那，前往布达佩斯。
    到机场欢送的有霍查、谢胡、列希等阿尔巴尼亚党政领导人以及地拉那市劳动人民一万多人。
    赫鲁晓夫在机场讲话中对阿尔巴尼亚人民的热情接待表示感谢。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们对阿尔巴尼亚人民的美好未来满怀信心。阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下建立了自己的自由独立的国家，而现在则满怀信心地在建设社会主义和共产主义的道路上前进。这是唯一正确的、最可靠的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在社会主义国家的兄弟大家庭中，我们将互相帮助，并肩前进，发展自己的经济，使人民的物质福利不断增长。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我常听到这样一种说法：阿尔巴尼亚是一个小国，它同它的社会主义阵营的盟国不接壤。我想，这一点现在并不重要。赫鲁晓夫指出，虽然阿尔巴尼亚不是一个大国，但是它加入了社会主义阵营的大家庭，加入了华沙条约国家的大家庭。因此，阿尔巴尼亚人民可以相信，苏联和其他兄弟社会主义国家不会让它受到灾祸。如果侵略势力企图侵犯阿尔巴尼亚的独立，那么我们将齐心协力防止侵略，如果发生了侵略，那么就严惩侵略者。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查也讲了话。他说，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团在阿尔巴尼亚访问的日子成了我们两国人民之间的兄弟友谊的庄严有力的表现；这些日子在所有阿尔巴尼亚人民的心灵中留下了深刻的印象。
    霍查在讲话中对苏联人民的无私的帮助表示了真诚的感谢。他说，这种帮助阿尔巴尼亚独立自主的发展和作为一个社会主义国家的繁荣昌盛具有决定意义。
