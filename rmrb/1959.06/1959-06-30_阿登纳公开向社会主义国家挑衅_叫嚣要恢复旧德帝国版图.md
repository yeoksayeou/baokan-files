Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, June 28th. West German Chancellor Adenauer delivered a speech today at a large-scale rally organized in Cologne by the West German revanchist group "Silesian Compatriot Association," openly provoking Poland and other socialist countries in Eastern Europe.

Adenauer said: "I must emphatically point out to the world again that no part of the former German Reich can be taken from us without a treaty; the people (from these regions) have an indisputable right to their own homeland and are entitled to demand this right." His remarks referred to the Silesia region east of the Oder-Neisse River, which has been Polish territory since ancient times. He even arrogantly stated that he hoped to "one day" extend the so-called "European unification to the Eastern European countries." These words fully demonstrate Adenauer's imperialist ambitions to invade and subvert Poland and other Eastern European socialist countries.

    阿登纳公开向社会主义国家挑衅
    叫嚣要恢复旧德帝国版图
    新华社波恩28日电　西德总理阿登纳今天在西德复仇主义团体“西里西亚同乡会”在科隆组织的一次大规模集会上发表演说，公开向波兰和东欧其它社会主义国家挑衅。
    阿登纳说：“我必须向全世界再次着重指出，昔日德意志帝国的任何一部分，都不能不经过条约而从我们手里拿走；（来自这些地区的）人民对他们自己的家乡享有无可争辩的权利，而且有资格要求这种权利。”他这番话指的是奥得—尼斯河以东从古就是波兰领土的西里西亚地区。他甚至狂妄地表示，希望“有朝一日”能把所谓“欧洲统一也扩大到东欧国家去”。这些话充分表明了阿登纳妄想侵略和颠复波兰以及其他东欧社会主义国家的帝国主义野心。
