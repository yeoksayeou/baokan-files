Troops Stationed in Zhejiang Raise 30,000 Pigs

    (By our paper's dispatch) The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang's army, navy, and air force units are vigorously developing agricultural and sideline production by utilizing gaps between duty and training. This year, they have already raised 33,055 pigs and harvested more than 4.6 million jin of vegetables.

    The number of pigs raised by Zhejiang Military Region troops this year has more than doubled compared to the end of last year. The Second Detachment of Unit 3583 raises an average of five pigs per six people. They now have more than 60 fat pigs weighing over 150 jin, the largest weighing nearly 700 jin, and more than 10 others weighing over 300 jin. A certain unit responsible for coastal defense and border defense scattered duty raises an average of one pig per person. The pig farm of a certain unit stationed in Hangzhou extensively harvests various kinds of pigweed to solve the problem of green fodder, and utilizes by-products such as molasses from workshops as refined feed. They are also preparing to plant water hyacinth in large quantities recently.

    The broad masses of officers and soldiers actively participate in pig raising. Many comrades use their spare time to collect wild pigweed in the mountains. They say, "Raising more pigs is beneficial to the country and also beneficial to the troops. Let's all get to work and raise the pigs well!" Comrade Ying Guangde, a cook in Unit 0451, in addition to completing his own job, also serves as a feeder. The more than 80 pigs he has fed (cumulative number) are all fat and strong. According to recent four-month statistics, he alone has cut more than 40,000 jin of pigweed and planted more than 5,000 jin of vegetables.

    In addition to raising pigs, all units have extensively developed vegetable production. A certain air force unit stationed in Zhejiang has already harvested more than 800,000 jin of vegetables this year. Unit 0922 has harvested more than 1 million jin of vegetables and also planted 1,800 mu of oil crops and feed crops. In the past, the non-staple foods of the troops stationed on various coastal islands in Zhejiang were all supplied by the mainland. This year, due to the vigorous development of agricultural and sideline production, many units have achieved self-sufficiency in pork and vegetables.

    驻浙江部队养猪三万头
    本报讯　中国人民解放军驻浙江的陆、海、空军部队广大官兵利用执勤、训练的间隙，大力开展农副业生产，今年已养猪三万三千零五十五头，收获蔬菜四百六十多万斤。
    浙江军区部队今年养猪头数比去年年底增加一倍以上。三五八三部队二分队平均每六人养五头猪，现有一百五十斤以上的肥猪六十余头，最大的近七百斤，还有十余头在三百斤以上。担任海防、边防分散执勤任务的某部队平均每人养一头猪。驻杭州某部队的养猪场，广泛收割各种猪草，解决青饲料问题，并利用作坊糖渣等副产品作精饲料，最近还准备大量种植水浮莲。
    广大官兵积极参加养猪工作，许多同志利用业余时间到山地采集野生猪草。他们说：“多养猪对国家有利，对部队也有利，我们大家动起手来，把猪养好！”零四五一部队炊事员应光德同志除了完成本职工作以外，还兼任饲养员，经他喂养的八十多头猪（累计数），头头肥壮。据最近四个月统计，他一人就打了四万多斤猪草，种了五千多斤菜。
    除了养猪以外，各部队都广泛开展了蔬菜生产。驻浙空军某部今年已收获蔬菜八十余万斤。零九二二部队已收获蔬菜一百余万斤，还种植了一千八百亩油料和饲料作物。驻浙沿海各岛屿部队的副食品，过去都靠大陆供应，今年由于大力开展了农副业生产，许多部队达到了猪肉蔬菜自给。
