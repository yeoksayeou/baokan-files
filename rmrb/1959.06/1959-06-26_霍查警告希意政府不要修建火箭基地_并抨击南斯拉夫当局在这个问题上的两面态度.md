Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 23rd. Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, visited an agricultural cooperative in the Gjirokastër region on the 22nd and delivered a lengthy speech at a rally held by cooperative members and nearby farmers.

    Speaking about the issue of the United States establishing rocket bases in Greece and Italy, Hoxha said that we do not interfere in the internal affairs of the Greek people; on the contrary, we hope to live peacefully with the Greek people. The same goes for the Italian people. We say to the Greek and Italian governments, why do you want to set up rocket bases in your countries? For what purpose? Who will invade Greece or Italy? Certainly no one. Hoxha pointed out that establishing rocket bases in Italy and Greece only benefits U.S. imperialism and primarily endangers the Greek and Italian peoples. Hoxha reiterated that there are no rocket bases in Albania. He said that if our neighbors Italy and Greece allow rocket bases to be established in their countries, we will be forced to take some measures to defend our country and the socialist camp. Hoxha said that the Greek government should not embark on this path that endangers the Greek people and all the peoples of the Balkan countries.

    Hoxha also pointed out at the meeting that Western countries are trying every possible means to prevent the West Berlin issue from being resolved and to obstruct the signing of a peace treaty with Germany. He said that if Western countries do not sign a peace treaty with the two Germanys, then we and other countries will sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, and as Comrade Khrushchev said, later, when the ruling groups in the Federal Republic of Germany recognize the necessity of concluding a treaty, they will also sign the treaty.

    Speaking about relations with neighboring countries, Hoxha said that we hope to get along well with the people of all countries, especially with the people of our neighboring countries. We have been and are friends of the Yugoslav people. But the revisionist leaders who rule Yugoslavia today are enemies of Marxism-Leninism and of our Marxist-Leninist party. We have been and are vigilant against them. In order to defend the victorious achievements of our people, we will never relax this vigilance.

    Speaking at a mass meeting in Albania on the 23rd to celebrate the completion of the South Ochuqa Canal, Hoxha once again mentioned the issue of establishing missile bases in Greece and criticized Yugoslavia's attitude on this issue.

    Hoxha said that on the one hand, the Yugoslav government expressed its support for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-weapon-free zone of peace in the Balkans and the Mediterranean, but on the other hand, it did not condemn Greece's establishment of missile bases in the slightest. Hoxha pointed out that the Yugoslav government's position is a typical anti-Marxist revisionist position. Otherwise, Yugoslav government officials should openly oppose this decision by the Greek government, because this decision is harmful to the interests of the Balkan people and peace.

    霍查警告希意政府不要修建火箭基地
    并抨击南斯拉夫当局在这个问题上的两面态度
    新华社地拉那23日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查22日访问了吉诺卡斯特州的一个农业合作社，并在社员和附近农民举行的集会上发表了长篇演说。
    霍查在谈到美国在希腊和意大利建立火箭基地的问题时说，我们没有干涉希腊人民的内政，相反地，我们希望同希腊人民和平相处。对意大利人民也是一样。我们向希腊和意大利政府说，你们为什么要在你们的国家设立火箭基地？为了什么目的？谁将侵犯希腊或意大利呢？肯定没有任何人。霍查指出，在意大利和在希腊设立火箭基地只是对美帝国主义有利，并首先危害着希腊人民和意大利人民。霍查再次声明，在阿尔巴尼亚没有火箭基地。他说，在我们的邻国意大利和希腊允许在自己国内设立火箭基地的情况下，我们将被迫采取一些措施来保卫我们的国家和保卫社会主义阵营。霍查说，希腊政府不应该走上这条危害希腊人民和所有巴尔干国家人民的道路。
    霍查在会上还指出，西方国家千方百计地力图使西柏林问题得不到解决，并阻挠对德和约的签订。他说，如果西方国家不同两个德国签订和约，那末我们这些国家将同德意志民主共和国签订和约，并且如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，以后在德意志联邦共和国统治集团认识到缔结和约的必要性时，他们也会在和约上签字的。
    霍查在谈到同邻国的关系时说，我们希望同一切国家的人民友好相处，特别是同我们邻国的人民。我们过去和现在都是南斯拉夫人民的朋友。但是今天统治着南斯拉夫的修正主义领导者则是马克思列宁主义和我们这个马克思列宁主义党的敌人。我们过去和现在都对他们保持警惕。为了保卫我国人民的胜利果实，我们将永远不放松这种警惕。
    霍查23日在阿尔巴尼亚庆祝南鄂楚卡渠道落成的一次群众大会上发表讲话时又一次提到在希腊建立导弹基地问题，并抨击南斯拉夫在这个问题上的态度。
    霍查说，南斯拉夫政府一方面表示赞成建立巴尔干和地中海无核武器和火箭武器的和平区，但是，它又丝毫不谴责希腊建立导弹基地。霍查指出，南斯拉夫政府的这种立场是典型的反马克思主义的修正主义的立场。不然，南斯拉夫政府人士就应该公开地表示反对希腊政府的这项决定，因为这项决定是危害巴尔干人民及和平的利益的。
