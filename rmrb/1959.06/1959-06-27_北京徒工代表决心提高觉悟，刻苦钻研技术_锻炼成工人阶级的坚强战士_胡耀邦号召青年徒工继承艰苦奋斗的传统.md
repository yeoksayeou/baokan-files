Beijing Apprentice Representatives Determined to Raise Awareness, Diligently Study Technology
　　Train to Become Strong Warriors of the Working Class
　　Hu Yaobang Calls on Young Apprentices to Inherit the Tradition of Hard Struggle

　　(Our Dispatch) The Beijing Municipal Industrial and Transportation System Apprentice Representative Conference, which lasted five days, concluded on the 26th. The more than 2,500 apprentice representatives attending the conference unanimously stated that they would consciously transform their thinking, diligently study technology, cultivate the habit of enduring hardship and hard work, and develop a simple and unadorned style under the education and care of the Party and master workers, and train themselves to become strong warriors of the working class with high ideological awareness, a high degree of organization and discipline, and a mastery of modern technology.

　　Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. He called on young apprentices to establish a communist worldview, cultivate excellent qualities of hard work, diligence, and thrift, strictly train themselves, and become strong warriors of the working class.

　　Hu Yaobang said that to become a skilled technical worker, one must be able to skillfully operate a technology, produce no or few defective products, understand the structure and performance of the machinery and equipment related to oneself, be able to do the simplest repairs on ordinary machines and tools, and also be able to do one or two other processes or types of work. It is impossible to learn these skills in a short period of time. Our Party hopes that our apprentices will take two or three years to learn these skills. He asked the apprentices to cherish this learning time, work hard, and strive to improve their skills.

　　Hu Yaobang encouraged the apprentices to inherit the tradition of hard struggle from the revolutionary elders and the older generation of the working class; in arranging their lives, they should be careful in their calculations, diligent, and thrifty. Hu Yaobang said: Is it good for young people to endure some hardship? I think there are at least two benefits: cultivating the spirit of enduring hardship and cultivating the habit of thrift. What did our Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army rely on to start their careers? Why was our revolution able to achieve victory? A very important reason is because we have the two things mentioned above. Today, we must also use this spirit to spur ourselves on, make ourselves stronger, and build our country more prosperous and strong.

　　Hu Yaobang said: Our Party and Chairman Mao are very concerned about and care for young people, just like our mothers. But what exactly counts as loving children? There are two ways: one way is to raise children delicately, give them whatever they want, and ignore them when they do bad things. This is a wrong way. The other is a sincere way of raising children, which is the way the Party cares for and loves young people: First, create learning conditions for him and urge him to study hard and truly learn skills; second, within a certain period of time, let him endure some hardship appropriately, so that he can develop a spirit of enduring hardship and become stronger; third, criticize and educate him when he has shortcomings and mistakes, so that he can gain experience. We must stand higher, see further, consciously and happily accept this training, and become strong warriors of the great working class.

　　Yang Huijie, Deputy Minister of the Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, spoke at the meeting.

　　During the meeting, Hang Baohua, an old worker of the "February 7th" of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, Wang Shan, an old worker of the "February 7th" of the Fengtai Rolling Stock Depot, Liu Guangjin, an old stoker of the Shijingshan Power Plant, and Chen Wenzhong, an old worker of the Xinhua Printing Factory, also used their own personal experiences to respectively tell about the revolutionary traditions of the working class, the tragic life of apprentices in the old society, and the excellent qualities of workers loving the factory as their home, consciously working, and studying diligently after liberation. These speeches gave the apprentices great education and enlightenment.

　　Beijing's factories, mines, enterprises, and transportation departments recruited more than 100,000 new apprentices last year. In the past year since they entered the factory, under the cultivation of the Party organizations and master workers in various units, the ideological awareness and technical level of the vast majority of people have been improved to a certain extent. Under the guidance of their masters, many apprentices have begun to take over production shifts and become a new force in production. Among the vast number of apprentices, a trend of actively working, studying hard, respecting masters, and being simple and unadorned has begun to form. However, because they come from all strata of society and lack strict training in class struggle and production labor, and in addition to being put into intense production after entering the factory without undergoing more systematic political and technical training, after making some progress and playing some roles, some apprentices have developed tendencies of arrogance and complacency, focusing on personal gains and losses, and neglecting politics. This meeting, aimed at the above situation, adopted the method of holding meetings in a centralized manner and conducting group discussions to improve thinking in connection with reality. On the last day of the meeting, Li Jincai, a Beijing Red Banner pacesetter and female apprentice from the Beijing Enamel Factory, and Ge Wanqing, an apprentice from the Mentougou Coal Mine who risked his life to rescue oxygen cylinders that were about to explode, reported on their gains as apprentices over the past year at the conference, and many apprentices wrote big-character posters. They jointly expressed their determination to learn from the noble qualities of the working class who love the Party, the country, and the cause of the working class, to further boost their energy, strive to transform their thinking, diligently study technology, and train themselves to become a new force in building socialism.

　　This meeting was jointly convened by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and was presided over by Wang Zhaohua, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. Peng Siming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, made a summary.

    北京徒工代表决心提高觉悟，刻苦钻研技术
    锻炼成工人阶级的坚强战士
    胡耀邦号召青年徒工继承艰苦奋斗的传统
    本报讯　历时五天的北京市工业交通系统徒工代表会议，已在26日结束。参加会议的二千五百多名徒工代表一致表示，他们要在党和老师傅的教育和关怀下，自觉改造思想，刻苦钻研技术，养成吃苦耐劳的习惯和艰苦朴素的作风，把自己锻炼成有高度的思想觉悟、有高度组织性纪律性、熟练地掌握现代技术的工人阶级坚强战士。
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记胡耀邦参加了会议并讲了话。他号召青年徒工树立共产主义世界观，培养刻苦耐劳、勤俭节约的优秀品质，严格锻炼自己，做一个工人阶级的坚强战士。
    胡耀邦说，成为一个熟练的技术工人，要能够熟练地操作一门技术，不出或少出废品；懂得同自己有关的机器设备的构造和性能；对普通的机器和工具能作最简单的修理；同时还会干另外一两个工序或工种的活。要学到这几门本事，短时间是不行的。我们党正是希望我们徒工用两三年的时间，学到这几门本事。他要求徒工珍惜这段学习时间，刻苦用功，努力提高技术。
    胡耀邦勉励徒工们继承革命长辈和工人阶级老一代艰苦奋斗的传统；在安排自己的生活上，要精打细算，勤俭朴素。胡耀邦说：青年时期吃一点苦好不好？我认为至少有两条好处：培养吃苦耐劳的精神，养成勤俭持家的习惯。我们的共产党、解放军靠什么起家呢？我们的革命为什么能够取得胜利？很重要的一个原因，就是因为我们具有上面所说的两条。今天，我们也要靠这种精神来鞭策自己，把自己锻炼得更坚强，把我们的国家建设得更繁荣兴旺。
    胡耀邦说：我们的党和毛主席是非常关心和爱护青年的，真是像我们的妈妈一样。但是，究竟怎样才算爱儿女呢？有两种办法：一种办法是把儿女养得娇滴滴的，要什么给什么，作了坏事也不管，这是一种错误的办法。另一种是真心带儿女的办法，也就是党关心和爱护青年的方法：第一，给他创造学习的条件，督促他好好学习，真正学到本领；第二，在一定时期内，让他适当地吃一点苦，使他养成一种吃苦耐劳的精神，使他变得更坚强；第三，有了缺点和错误就批评教育他，使他取得经验。我们要站得高一些，要看得远一些，要自觉地、高高兴兴地接受这个锻炼，成为伟大工人阶级的坚强的战士。
    中共北京市委工业部副部长杨慧洁在会上讲了话。
    在会议期间，长辛店机车车辆工厂“二七”老工人杭宝华、丰台车辆段“二七”老工人王山、石景山发电厂老司炉刘光金和新华印刷厂老工人陈文忠，也都用自己的亲身经历分别讲述了工人阶级的革命传统、旧社会徒工的悲惨生活，以及解放后工人爱厂如家、自觉劳动、刻苦学习的优秀品质。这些讲话，给徒工们极大的教育和启发。
    北京市各厂矿企业和交通运输部门在去年先后招收十多万新徒工。他们入厂一年来，在各单位党组织和老师傅的培养下，绝大多数人的思想觉悟和技术水平都有一定的提高。不少徒工在师傅的指导下已经开始顶班生产，成为生产上一支新生力量。在广大徒工中，已开始形成积极劳动、努力学习、尊敬师傅和艰苦朴素的风气。但是，由于他们来自社会的各个阶层，又缺乏阶级斗争和生产劳动的严格锻炼，再加上入厂后就投入了紧张的生产中，没有经过比较系统的政治和技术训练，所以在有了一些进步，起了一些作用之后，有些徒工又滋长了骄傲自满、计较个人得失和忽视政治的倾向。这次会议，就是针对上述情况，采取集中开会，分组讨论的办法，联系实际，提高思想。在会议的最后一天，北京市红旗手、北京珐琅厂女徒工李金财和冒着生命危险抢救将要爆炸的氧气瓶的门头沟煤矿徒工葛万庆等在大会上汇报了自己当徒工一年来的收获，并有许多徒工写了大字报。他们共同表示决心向老工人学习工人阶级热爱党，热爱国家，热爱工人阶级事业的高贵品质，进一步鼓足干劲，努力改造思想，刻苦学习技术，把自己锻炼成为建设社会主义的一支新生力量。
    这次会议是北京市工会联合会和共青团北京市委员会联合召开的，由共青团北京市委第一书记王照华主持，北京市工会联合会副主席彭思明作了总结。
