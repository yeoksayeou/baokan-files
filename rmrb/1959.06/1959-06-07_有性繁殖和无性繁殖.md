Little Common Sense

    There are many methods for cultivating tree seedlings, but they can basically be classified into two categories: sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction.
    Sexual reproduction involves using mature tree seeds to cultivate new seedlings. Using sexual reproduction methods for seedling cultivation results in high yields per unit area, and abundant seed sources can be obtained.
    Asexual reproduction involves using the roots, stems, leaves, and buds of trees, and through methods such as cuttings, layering, grafting, and division, causing them to develop into new plants. Seedlings from asexual reproduction grow faster, bear fruit earlier, and can maintain the excellent characteristics of the parent tree.

    有性繁殖和无性繁殖
    各种树木育苗的方法很多，但基本上可归纳为两类：有性繁殖和无性繁殖。
    有性繁殖是利用成熟的树木种子培育出新的树苗。用有性繁殖方法育苗，单位面积产量高，可取得丰富的种源。
    无性繁殖是利用树木的根、茎、叶、芽，通过扦插、埋条、嫁接、分株等方法，使它发育成为新的植株。无性繁殖的苗木生长快、结实早，并能保持母树的优良特性。
