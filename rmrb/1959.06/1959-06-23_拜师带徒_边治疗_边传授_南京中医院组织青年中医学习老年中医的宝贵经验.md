    Apprenticeship and Mentoring: Teaching While Treating
    Nanjing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Organizes Young TCM Doctors to Learn Valuable Experience from Veteran TCM Doctors

    (Our report) Nanjing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine actively takes measures to organize young TCM doctors to study and inherit the academic experience of veteran TCM doctors.

    The hospital has many famous and experienced veteran TCM doctors. How to promptly acquire their valuable experience, passed down through generations and painstakingly researched over decades, and prevent it from being lost, is an extremely important task for inheriting and developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. The hospital organized twenty-one young and middle-aged TCM doctors in the hospital to apprentice to fourteen veteran TCM doctors respectively, forming a clinical research class dedicated to learning clinical experience from veteran TCM doctors. Young pharmaceutical workers also apprentice to veteran pharmaceutical workers to inherit experience in preparing Chinese medicine. In addition, veteran TCM doctors outside the hospital who have expertise or unique skills in a certain department are invited to the hospital to hold professional exchange meetings and seminars, and young TCM doctors are organized to record them, then systematically research, organize, and compile the information.

    Veteran TCM doctors have rich experience and each has their own strengths, but some have certain difficulties in systematic teaching. Therefore, the hospital adopted methods such as teaching whatever is available, explaining whatever is encountered, recording whatever is taught, and teaching while working, which relieved some veteran TCM doctors of their concerns about not being able to provide a complete set of theories.

    Because these young and middle-aged TCM doctor apprentices have a certain level of theoretical knowledge and clinical experience, they accept the experience of veteran TCM doctors relatively quickly. Through more than a year of study, they have not only improved their medical skills, but also helped veteran TCM doctors summarize key cases and write forty-two papers, classify and organize eighteen volumes of medical records, and twelve medical notes. In addition, they have systematically summarized the experience of veteran TCM doctors in nursing over the decades and compiled "Traditional Chinese Medicine Nursing" (which has been published). Currently, they are working on summarizing the clinical experience of TCM departments. With these young and middle-aged TCM doctor apprentices as assistants, veteran TCM doctors can free up some time for important research by assisting with general treatment work. At the same time, they feel that their own experience has been systematized through apprentices' recording and organization, which is also helpful to themselves.

    In the process of organizing young and middle-aged TCM doctors to learn from veteran TCM doctors, the hospital's Party organization attaches importance to strengthening ideological education for teachers and apprentices. Initially, some young TCM doctors felt that they already had five to ten years of clinical experience and had some complacency, feeling aggrieved by being assistants to veteran TCM doctors; veteran TCM doctors also had concerns when teaching because some young TCM doctors were arrogant. The hospital's Party organization promptly organized everyone to study, which improved the understanding of young and middle-aged TCM doctors and corrected their learning attitude, quickly forming a climax of apprenticeship. Veteran TCM doctors also dispelled their concerns and actively taught. For example, veteran TCM doctor Cao Minggao often used his spare time to teach his apprentices clinical experience, and the apprentices learned a lot of experience and improved their medical skills. Another example is Dr. Yao Lijuan, who, after learning from veteran physician Xu Xiyan, basically mastered the old physician's experience in treating kidney diseases.

### 拜师带徒　边治疗　边传授  南京中医院组织青年中医学习老年中医的宝贵经验

    拜师带徒　边治疗　边传授
    南京中医院组织青年中医学习老年中医的宝贵经验
    本报讯　南京中医学院附属医院积极采取措施，组织青年中医学习和继承老年中医的学术经验。
    该院有许多有名的、经验丰富的老年中医，如何及时把他们那些世代家传、又经过自己数十年苦心钻研的宝贵经验接受下来，不使失传，是继承和发扬祖国医学遗产的一项极为重要的工作。该院组织院内二十一名在职青壮年中医，分别拜十四位老年中医为师，组成临床研究班，专门跟随老中医学习临床经验。青年药工也拜老药工为师，继承中药泡制经验。此外，还邀请院外对某一科有专长或有一技之长的老年中医，来院举行专业交流会、座谈会，组织青年中医记录，然后系统研究整理汇编。
    老年中医有丰富的经验，还各有擅长，但有些人对系统讲授有一定困难；因此，该院采取了有什么就教什么，碰到什么就讲什么，讲什么就记什么，边工作边传授等办法，解除了部分老中医怕拿不出成套理论的顾虑。
    由于这些青壮年中医徒弟，具有一定的理论水平和临床经验，因此对老中医的经验接受较快。通过一年多的学习，不仅提高了医疗水平，而且帮助老中医总结重点病例，写出论文四十二篇，分类整理医案十八本，医话十二篇。另外，还系统地总结了老年中医数十年来在护理方面的经验，编写了“中医护病学”（已出版）。现在，正着手编写中医各科临床经验的总结。老中医有了这些青壮年中医徒弟当助手，协助进行一般的治疗工作，可以腾出一部分时间进行重要的研究。同时，自己的经验经过徒弟记录整理而系统化了，感到对自己也有帮助。
    在组织青壮年中医学习老中医的过程中，该院党组织重视加强对师徒的思想教育。起先，有些青年中医觉得自己已有五年到十年的临床经验，有些自满情绪，对做老中医助手感到委屈；老年中医也因某些青年中医有骄气，传授时有顾虑。该院党组织及时组织大家进行学习，提高了青壮年中医的认识，端正了学习态度，很快形成了拜师高潮。老中医也打破顾虑，积极传授。如曹鸣高老中医，常利用业余时间给徒弟讲授临床心得，徒弟学到不少经验，提高了医疗水平。又如姚丽娟医师向许锡彦老医师学习后，基本上掌握了老医师治疗肾脏病的经验。
