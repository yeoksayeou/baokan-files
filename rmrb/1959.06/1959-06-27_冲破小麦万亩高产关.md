Breaking Through the Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Barrier for Wheat

    An Exciting Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Area
    The ten thousand mu contiguous high-yield area in sixteen large teams of the Laocheng and Zhaizhen Communes in Yanshi County, Henan Province, has an average wheat yield of 603 jin per mu. This is exciting news!
    We have visited the ten thousand mu high-yield area three times, one after another. Each time, our hearts were stirred for a long time. I remember the first time we arrived at the ten thousand mu high-yield area, the boundless wheat fields were neatly divided by straight roads. It is no exaggeration to say that the land was as smooth as a mirror. The robust wheat seedlings looked like green carpets, and each square had countless identical small ridges, like patterns in the green carpets. There were neat fences along the fields, and newly planted poplars along the roads. Seeing this intoxicating scenery, we excitedly thought: This is truly the laboring people using their ingenious hands to embroider dragons and phoenixes on the earth. In mid-May, when we came here again, the fields were already rolling with waves of wheat, the stalks were so dense that "no soil could be seen"; the swaying layer of wheat ears was so uniform and neat that it was almost impossible to enter the wheat field. Recently, we went to the ten thousand mu high-yield area again, and it was already harvest season. The fertile land on both sides of the Luo River was a golden ocean. Every farmer beamed with joy, describing this year's wheat as: "A joy to look at, a hustle to cut, a struggle to transport, and a laugh to thresh." In the past, a strong laborer could easily cut an acre or eight fen of wheat a day with a sickle; this year, it takes all their strength to cut only four or five fen a day. The fallen wheat swaths lay one after another, almost completely covering the ground. The wheat stacks in the threshing ground were like artificial mountains and ridges of wheat.

    Communalization and High-Yield Areas
    The fact that the ten thousand mu high-yield area achieved an average yield of 603 jin per mu fully proves the superiority of the people's commune system.
    Before communalization, people dared not imagine being able to create a ten thousand mu high-yield area like today. At that time, each advanced cooperative was limited to its own small scope, and the liberation (mainly of women) and deployment of labor, as well as the promotion of agricultural technology, were limited to a certain extent. When we were interviewing in Yuetan, Li Jiayin, the deputy secretary of this large team, told us a law: the promotion of agricultural technology, the growth of production, and the development of agricultural cooperation and people's communes are complementary to each other, and agricultural production increases as production relations change. In 1953, when their village organized mutual aid teams, only fourteen mu of wheat were densely planted; in 1954, when two elementary cooperatives were established, they planted more than 280 mu of wheat in the autumn. At that time, some people specialized in planting sparsely planted wheat to compete with the agricultural cooperative, and the result was that the densely planted wheat yielded 373 jin per mu, while the sparsely planted wheat yielded 244 jin per mu. After the summer harvest of 1955, a high tide of cooperation appeared in Yuetan, and dense planting of wheat was universally promoted this year. He said that only after the people's communes are established can the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture be fully implemented like today.
    In 1958, the people's communes were realized, and the enthusiasm and desire for increased production among the masses became even higher. The Yanshi County Committee of the Communist Party of China grasped the demands of the masses, delineated 10,000 mu of land along the Luo River to create a 10,000 mu high-yield area for wheat, appointed a special person to establish a headquarters for the 10,000 mu high-yield area, and mobilized the entire population to debate the favorable conditions and measures for creating the 10,000 mu high-yield area.
    Once the ten thousand mu high-yield area was established, the first measure proposed was: deep plowing the land to about one chi. For many years, the cultivated land here had only been plowed to a depth of six or seven cun. Deep plowing to one chi in the high-yield area was an arduous combat task. At that time, at the height of the entire population's efforts to produce steel, more than half of the strong labor force had gone to make steel. The people's communes gave full play to their superiority, organized large-scale cooperation, used large-scale shock tactics, opened public canteens and nurseries, liberated a large number of female laborers, and became the main force in deep plowing the land. Now, when people are cheering for the large-scale high yield of the ten thousand mu high-yield area, they are unanimously praising the benefits of the people's communes. Communalization created the conditions for large-scale high yield, and large-scale high yield demonstrates the characteristics of the era.

    Comprehensively Implementing the "Eight-Character Charter"
    In the ten thousand mu high-yield area, we visited commune members and cadres, scientific and technical personnel and experienced farmers, and they all said in unison that the decisive factor for this year's large-scale high yield is the combination of a spirit of daring to think and act with a scientific analytical attitude, and the comprehensive and integrated implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.
    Creating high yields on ten thousand mu of land, this bold initiative shook the hearts of everyone. People understood the significance of a large-scale bumper harvest, and they discussed ways to achieve high yields. The most debated issue was the issue of dense planting. In the past, the seeding rate in this area had gradually increased from seven or eight jin per mu to fifteen jin and eighteen jin; each increase in the seeding rate resulted in an increase in yield. Many people inferred from this law that if the seeding rate remained at a little over ten jin, it would not be easy to increase production more than in 1958; and the density in 1958 had not reached its peak, so the seeding rate could still be increased. Therefore, some people advocated sowing 30 jin, some said 40 jin or 50 jin, and some thought the more the better, sowing 60 jin, 80 jin, or 100 jin per mu; others thought that maintaining the original seeding rate could also increase production.
    In order to better solve the problem of rational close planting, the Yanshi County Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the masses to discuss it widely. At the same time, they sent the director of the County Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry and a member of the County Party Committee to other counties to learn about the experience of close planting. During the discussion in the Yuetan Brigade, some people advocated planting 40 jin. The old farmer Ren Maodan raised a different opinion: "Our row spacing here is five cun. If we plant 40 jin, the wheat seeds will overlap in the ground, and the seedlings will not emerge well." The cadres studied his opinion and thought it made sense. They further studied it, changed the five-cun row spacing to three and a half cun (successfully tested in 1958), and changed the two-fen sowing width to five fen, so it was just right to sow a little over 30 jin. Based on the opinions widely discussed by the masses and referring to the experience of other places, the Yanshi County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a special study and believed that appropriately increasing the density on the basis of 1958 was an important key to increasing production, and determined that the seeding rate should be controlled below 40 jin.
    After the core of the "Eight-Character Charter"—the close planting problem—was settled, everyone discussed how to keep up with other measures such as soil, fertilizer, and water. The cadres and the masses combined, and after careful study, they believed that the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture was interconnected and must be comprehensively utilized. It was determined that the deep plowing of the land should be deepened from the past six cun to around one chi, that sufficient base fertilizer should be applied, that five irrigations should be done well, and that specific methods should also be studied for protection and management. These were all specifically implemented: of the ten thousand mu of land, 3,950 mu were deeply plowed from eight cun to one chi, 5,613 mu were deeply plowed from one chi to one chi and two cun, 267 mu were deeply plowed from one chi and five cun to three chi, and 170 mu were deeply plowed above three chi; base fertilizer and topdressing averaged 15,000 jin to 20,000 jin per mu, with some chemical fertilizer, and seed fertilizer was also applied; five irrigations were done, including soil compaction, freeze-up, and greening (the last two irrigations were only done on some areas because it rained); other measures were also well implemented.
    Although the Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Area Headquarters and the major brigades had done sufficient work, the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" was still a struggle. When we were interviewing in Yuetan Brigade, Li Jiayin, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, introduced the following fact to us: several drill operators in the fourth production team of this brigade had ideological problems with planting more than 30 jin of seeds. They did as required when the inspections were strict in the first few days of planting. Later, when the inspections were slightly looser, they secretly changed to 18 jin. After the wheat seedlings emerged, the brigade found that the 40 mu of wheat seedlings in the fourth team were sparser than others, and they lost the argument every time they were inspected and compared. After the wheat jointed, the wheat seedlings planted with more than 30 jin were vigorous, but some areas showed signs of lodging. They became smug, saying, "You criticized us at that time, who should be criticized this time? Just talking is not enough. You can see from the yields who did it right." They were discouraged again as soon as the wheat started to head, because the wheat ears in these 40 mu of land had tens of thousands fewer ears per mu than those planted with 30 jin.
    The Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Area implemented various production increase measures conscientiously and meticulously through inspection and comparison methods. Inspections and comparisons were carried out approximately every ten days. From the deep plowing of the land to the harvesting of wheat, a total of 18 inspections and comparisons were carried out. Each inspection was led by personnel from the headquarters, leading cadres from the brigades and production teams, going deep into the fields, observing and studying, and proposing practical measures based on the different conditions of the wheat seedlings. Inspection and comparison is a good working method and a good form of competition. It can pool the wisdom of the masses, exchange experiences, inspire each other, establish advanced examples, and promote those who are lagging behind; it can also enable cadres to grasp the growth of wheat at any time, be aware of the situation, and "prescribe the right medicine." Through inspection and comparison, some teams that were originally lagging behind in production caught up.

    Hard Work, Meticulous Work, Skillful Work
    The large-scale high yield of the Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Area was not achieved easily; it was permeated with the soaring enthusiasm and wisdom of the broad masses of commune members. With the entire population engaged in large-scale steel production and a shortage of labor, a large-scale battle to deep-plow the land was also launched simultaneously, deep-plowing 10,000 mu of land to about one chi. This had never happened in history. When delivering manure, large carts were pulled, small carts were pushed, children carried baskets, and girls used baskets, truly using all available strength. In the later stages of wheat growth, wheat stem maggot, yellow rust, and armyworms came one after another, and the commune members waged a resolute battle against pests and diseases. When controlling armyworms, we were interviewing here. In areas with a high density, there were more than 200 inch-long worms in a square chi of wheat field, eating wheat leaves and tender wheat ear necks. Commune members used DDT and 666 powder to spray them in a concentrated attack.
    The Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Area's early efforts to prevent lodging show their meticulous and skillful work. As soon as the wheat turned green, a dispute arose over field management. Some people thought that the wheat seedlings were dense this year and needed another irrigation to promote seedling growth; most people thought that irrigating twice during the greening period would not be beneficial, because the wheat was densely planted, heavily fertilized, and growing vigorously this year, and preventing lodging became a prominent problem. Everyone summarized the past experience of preventing lodging and decided that it was necessary to start early, and it would be too late to start when the wheat seedlings grew taller. In the past, pulling nets and building racks had a certain effect on preventing lodging, but this method could only be used for a few experimental fields, and it was fundamentally impossible to use it on a large scale, and pulling nets and building racks was not a fundamental solution. Early prevention of lodging, in addition to applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizer and wood ash, also involved suppressing the seedlings during the greening period to inhibit the growth of the wheat seedlings, which achieved good results. The height of plants that were suppressed twice was 74.8 cm, and the lodging rate was 5%; the height of plants that were not suppressed was 84.7 cm, and the lodging rate was 35%.
    A large-scale bumper harvest is the result of hard work, meticulous work, and skillful work.

    Encouragement and Strength
    The large-scale bumper harvest in the ten thousand mu high-yield area was achieved through semi-mechanization (water conservancy machinery plus some mechanized farming) combined with the labor and wisdom of the broad masses of commune members. At the same time, it brought ideological and technical harvests. This great achievement encourages the masses far and near, sets an example for implementing the policy of multiple crops and high-yield fields at the same time, and points out the direction for people.
    Now, the masses within the ten thousand mu high-yield area have had a firsthand experience in the summer and have more confidence and methods in striving for a large-scale high yield in the autumn. The masses around the high-yield area have been inspired and have requested to create large-scale high-yield areas for grain and cotton. The Laocheng People's Commune only had 6,000 mu of high-yield area in the summer. They summarized the experience of creating high-yield areas in the summer and created 18,000 mu of high-yield area for corn and millet and 3,700 mu of high-yield area for cotton in the autumn. Using summer to promote autumn, they are determined to strive for a "full year of bumper harvests."

    冲破小麦万亩高产关
    河南日报记者　惠明深　本报记者　张励中
    激动人心的万亩丰产区
    河南省偃师县老城、翟镇两个公社十六个大队一块连片的万亩丰产区，平均亩产小麦六百零三斤。这是激动人心的消息！
    万亩丰产区，我们前后访问过三次。每次访问，我们的心情都久久不能平静下来。记得我们第一次到万亩丰产区的时候，一望无垠的麦田，被笔直的道路切得方方正正。说土地平整的像面镜子，显然并不过分。一方方茁壮的麦苗，像是绿茵茵的地毯，而每个方中又有数不清的大小一样的畦子，像绿毯中的图案。田边有整齐的篱笆，路边又有新栽的白杨。看到这番令人心醉的风光，我们兴奋地想：这真是劳动人民用巧夺天工的双手，在大地上描龙绣凤。5月中旬，我们再度来到这里的时候，田野里已是麦浪滚滚，麦秆密密麻麻的真是“撒土不漏”；摇摇摆摆的一层麦穗，是那样的匀称而又整齐，麦地里人简直进不去了。最近，我们又到万亩丰产区，已是收获季节了。洛河两岸的肥沃土地上，一片金色的海洋。个个农民眉笑颜开，他们形容今年的麦子是：“看着喜人，割着躁，运着费劲，打着笑。”往年，一个壮劳力，拿起镰刀一天割个亩儿八分麦算不了什么；今年，费尽全力一天也不过割四五分麦。放倒的麦铺子，一个挨一个，几乎盖严了地皮。麦场里的麦垛，像人工筑成的麦山、麦岭。
    公社化和丰产区
    万亩丰产区，获得平均亩产六百零三斤的事实，充分证明了人民公社制度的优越性。
    公社化以前，能不能搞像今天这样的万亩丰产区，人们是不敢想像的。那时候各个高级社都局限在自己的小范围内，劳动力的解放（主要是妇女）和调度，以及推广农业技术，都有一定程度的限制。我们在岳滩采访的时候，这个大队的副支书李甲寅向我们说了这样一个规律：农业技术的推广、生产的增长和农业合作化、人民公社化的发展是相辅相成的，农业增产是随着生产关系的改变在前进着。1953年，他们村搞互助组的时候，密植小麦只十四亩；1954年建了两个初级社，秋天种麦时就种了二百八十多亩。当时有人专种稀植麦和农业社比赛，结果密植的亩产三百七十三斤，稀植的亩产二百四十四斤。1955年夏收以后，岳滩出现了合作化的高潮，这年小麦密植就普遍推行了。他说，只有人民公社化以后，才能像今天这样全面地贯彻农业“八字宪法”。
    1958年实现了人民公社化，群众的干劲和增产的要求更加高涨了。中共偃师县委掌握了群众的要求，在洛河两岸划出一万亩土地，搞万亩小麦丰产区，指派专人成立了万亩丰产区指挥部，发动全民辩论大搞万亩丰产区的有利条件和措施。
    万亩丰产区一搞起来，提出的第一项措施是：土地深翻一尺左右。多少年来，这里的耕地只是犁六、七寸深，丰产区要深耕一尺，是一项艰巨的战斗任务。当时正在全民大办钢铁的节骨眼上，一半以上的强壮劳力去搞钢铁了。人民公社发挥了它的优越性，组织了大协作，运用大兵团突击，开办公共食堂、托儿所，解放了大批妇女劳力，成了深翻土地的主力军。现在，人们在欢呼万亩丰产区大面积高产的时候，都一致称颂人民公社的好处，公社化为大面积高产创造了条件，大面积高产显示了时代的特征。
    全面贯彻“八字宪法”
    在万亩丰产区，我们访问了社员和干部、科学技术人员和老农，他们异口同声地说，今年大面积丰产的决定因素，就是以敢想敢干的精神和科学分析的态度相结合，全面综合地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。
    在一万亩土地上要创造高产，这个大胆的创议震动着每个人的心。人们懂得大面积丰收的意义，人们讨论着达到高产的办法。争论最多的就是密植问题。过去，这一带由每亩播种七、八斤，逐年增加到十五斤、十八斤；每增加一次播种量，产量就有增加。许多人根据这个规律推断，如果播种量仍然停留在十几斤上，想比1958年更高地增产是不容易的；而1958年的密度并没有到顶，播种量还可以增加。因此，有人主张播种三十斤，有人说播种四十斤、五十斤，有人则认为越多越好，一亩地种它六十斤、八十斤、一百斤；也有人认为保持原来播种量也能增产。
    为了更好地解决合理密植问题，中共偃师县委发动群众广泛讨论，同时，又派县农林局长和一个县委委员到外县学习密植的经验。岳滩大队讨论时，有人主张下种四十斤。老农任毛旦提出不同意见：“咱这里是五寸行距，如果下种四十斤，麦籽耩到地里就会叠起来，苗准出不好。”干部们研究了他的意见，认为有道理，他们又进一步研究，将五寸行距改为三寸半行距（1958年试验成功的），将二分播幅改为五分播幅，下种三十斤多一点正合适。中共偃师县委根据群众广泛讨论的意见，参考外地的经验，专门作了研究，认为在1958年的基础上，适当地增加密度是增产的重要关键，确定下种量控制在四十斤以下。
    作为“八字宪法”的中心——密植问题定下来以后，大家又讨论土、肥、水等其他措施怎么跟上去。干部和群众结合，经过认真研究，认为农业“八字宪法”互相关连，必须综合利用。确定土地深耕由过去六寸加深到一尺上下，施足底肥，浇好五水，保、管等措施也具体研究了办法。这些都具体地执行了：一万亩土地深耕八寸到一尺的三千九百五十亩，一尺到一尺二寸的五千六百一十三亩，一尺五寸到三尺的二百六十七亩，三尺以上的一百七十亩；底肥、追肥平均每亩一万五千斤到二万斤，并有一部分化肥，还施了种肥；浇了踏地、封冻、返青等五水（后两水只浇了一部分就下雨了）；其他措施也抓得好。
    尽管万亩丰产区指挥部和各大队进行了充分的工作，但“八字宪法”执行起来仍然是有斗争的。我们在岳滩大队采访的时候，党支部副书记李甲寅向我们介绍了这样一个事实：这个大队的第四生产队有几个耧把手，对下种三十多斤思想不通，播种的头几天检查的严，他们照样办了；后来检查的稍松一点了，他们偷偷地改成了十八斤。麦苗出土后，大队发现四队的这四十亩麦苗比别的稀，每一次检查评比，他们都输了理。到小麦拔节后，下种三十多斤的麦苗旺盛；但有的地发现有倒伏的迹象。他们神气起来了，说什么“那时光批评咱，这回该批评谁了？光说不中，到底种多少籽好，可见高低了吧！”等小麦一抽出穗来，他们又泄气啦，因为这四十亩地的麦穗每亩比下种三十斤的少十几万。
    万亩丰产区通过检查评比的方法，认真细致地贯彻各项增产措施，差不多每隔十天左右就要检查评比一次。从深翻土地开始到收割麦子，一共评比了十八次，每次评比都是指挥部的人员带领上大队和生产队的干部，深入田间，观察研究，根据麦苗的不同情况，提出切实的措施。检查评比是一种良好的工作方法，又是开展竞赛的好形式。它能够集思广益，互相交流经验，互相启发，树立先进，促进后进；又能够使干部们随时掌握小麦生长情况，心中有数，“对症下药”。通过检查评比，使一些原来生产落后的队迎头赶上了。
    苦干、细干、巧干
    万亩丰产区大面积高产，并不是轻而易举得来的，它渗透着广大社员们冲天的干劲和智慧。在全民大办钢铁，劳力不足的情况下，同时展开了深翻土地的大战，将一万亩土地，深翻一尺上下。这是历史上从来没有过的。送粪的时候，大车拉、小车推，小孩挽篮送，姑娘们用筐挑，真是有多少力量都使出来了。小麦生长后期，吸浆虫、黄锈病、行军虫接踵袭来，社员们向病虫害进行了坚决的战斗。治行军虫的时候，我们正在这里采访，寸把长的虫子，多的地方一平方尺大的麦田里就有二百多条，吃小麦叶、吃嫩麦穗脖，社员们用滴滴涕和六六六粉突击喷杀。
    万亩丰产区及早抓防倒伏，说明了他们的细干、巧干。小麦刚返青，田间管理上发生了争论。有人认为，今年麦苗稠密，需要再浇一水，以便催苗生长；多数人认为，浇二次返青水没有好处。因为今年小麦密植、肥多、生长旺盛，防止倒伏成了突出的问题。大家总结了过去防倒伏的经验，必须早下手，到麦苗长高了再抓，就嫌晚了。过去拉网搭架，对防止倒伏有一定作用。但是这种办法只能用于少数试验田，大面积根本不可能，而且拉网搭架并不是治本的办法。早抓防倒伏，除了施磷钾肥、草木灰外，返青期进行镇压蹲苗，抑制一下麦苗的生长，收到了良好的效果。镇压二次的株高七十四点八公分，倒伏的占5％，不镇压的株高八十四点七公分，倒伏35％。
    大面积丰收，就是苦干、细干、巧干争得的。
    鼓舞和力量
    万亩丰产区大面积丰收，是在半机械化（水利机械加部分机耕）加上广大社员的劳动和智慧取得的，它同时带来了思想和技术上的丰收。这一巨大的成就，鼓舞着远近群众，为贯彻多种多收和高额丰产田同时实行的方针树立了榜样，给人们指出了方向。
    现在，万亩丰产区以内的群众有了夏季的亲身体验，对争取秋季大面积高产更有了信心和办法。丰产区周围的群众，受到了启发，纷纷要求搞大面积粮食、棉花丰产区。老城人民公社夏季只有六千亩丰产区，他们总结了夏季搞丰产区的经验，秋季搞了一万八千亩玉米、谷子丰产区，三千七百亩棉花丰产区。以夏促秋，决心争取“丰产全年红”。
