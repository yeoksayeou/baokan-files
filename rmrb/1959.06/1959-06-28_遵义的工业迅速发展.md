Zunyi City is the largest city that the Red Army occupied during the Long March. However, today's Zunyi City is very different from the Zunyi City of that time. Even compared to the situation during the Anti-Japanese War, when industry had slightly developed, and the situation at the time of liberation, the whole city had only three factories: one was an alcohol factory with an annual output of no more than 1,000 tons; one was a private joint-venture power plant of 45 kilowatts; and the other was a relatively modern flour mill with two steel rollers.

Looking at the current industrial development of Zunyi City, it can be said that it has been completely transformed compared to those days. The original three factories: the equipment of the flour mill has been doubled; the alcohol factory has expanded from an annual output of less than 1,000 tons to an annual output of 3,500 tons; the 45-kilowatt power plant, where people used candles under the electric lights, has been replaced by a 2,300-kilowatt thermal power plant, and a 6,000-kilowatt power plant is under construction and will be completed and generate electricity within the year.

Before 1957, Zunyi's industrial construction paid great attention to developing industries that processed local agricultural and sideline products, as well as industries that directly served agricultural production and people's lives and could use local materials. Among the larger factories built during this period were: silk weaving factory, re-drying factory, farm tool factory, phosphate fertilizer factory, match factory, soap factory, leather shoe factory, canned food factory, etc. The silk weaving factory began construction in 1954 and went into production in 1956. The tens of thousands of acres of mountains and forests in the Zunyi area, suitable for developing mulberry and tussah silkworms, are the factory's strong raw material base. Last year, the factory produced 430,000 meters of various kinds of silk and satin, and this year it plans to produce 800,000 meters. With the help of the Hangzhou Silk Weaving Factory, the quality of the products has rapidly improved, and some products have been used as export commodities. The Zunyi Phosphate Fertilizer Factory not only serves agricultural production in this province, but also supplies phosphate fertilizer to Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Henan, Shanxi and other places. Since last year, this factory has paid attention to comprehensive utilization, and now it also produces industrial raw materials such as sulfuric acid, sulfur, and cement. Zunyi's matches are also supplied to Sichuan, Yunnan and other places.

The Great Leap Forward in 1958 broke through the situation in Zunyi City, which only had light industry and processing industry. It has become one of the iron and steel bases in Guizhou Province, and the infrastructure construction of the newly built 954-type iron and steel enterprises is nearing completion. The manganese mine, which only produced manganese ore powder, has been expanded into an alloy factory. The mechanical industry in Zunyi City was also a blank sheet before liberation. There was not a single lathe in the city, only a few monkey wrenches and a few files. After several years of development and growth, especially the leap forward last year, there are now 70 lathes with a production capacity of 10,000 tons, capable of producing small machine tools and some equipment for small modern blast furnaces. At present, Zunyi City is carrying out an unprecedented construction undertaking. The working people of Zunyi City will live up to the glorious achievements of Zunyi City in history, and will surely build their city to be more beautiful and more brilliant. After the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway opens to traffic next year, passengers from north and south will visit the "Zunyi Conference" Memorial Hall with reverence and excitement, and they will also see a new and beautiful city.

    遵义的工业迅速发展
    遵义市是长征途中，红军进驻过的城市中最大的城市。但是，今天的遵义市和那时的遵义城比较，已有了很大的变化。就以在抗战时期工业已稍有发展的情况和解放当时的情况来看，全城有三个工厂：一个是年产量不超过一千吨的酒精厂；一个是由私人联营的四十五个瓩的发电厂，另一个是有两盘钢磨的比较近代化的面粉厂。
    纵观一下目前遵义市的工业发展情况，与当年比较，可说已面目全非了。原有的三个厂：面粉厂的设备扩大了一倍；酒精厂从年产不到千吨，扩大到年产三千五百吨；电灯下边点腊烛的四十五个瓩的发电厂，已被二千三百个瓩的火力发电厂所代替，而且一个六千瓩的发电厂正在兴建，年内就将建成并发电。
    1957年以前，遵义的工业建设，很注意发展对当地农副产品的加工工业，以及直接为农业生产与人民生活服务的并能够就地取材的工业。在这个时期建设的工厂中比较大的有：丝织厂、复烤厂、农具厂、磷肥厂、火柴厂、肥皂厂、皮鞋厂、罐头厂等等。丝织厂是1954年开始筹建，1956年投入生产的。遵义地区适合于发展桑蚕柞蚕的万千山林，是这个厂的雄厚的原料基地。这个厂去年年产各种绸缎达四十三万公尺，今年计划生产八十万公尺。在杭州丝织厂帮助下，产品质量迅速提高，部分产品已作为出口商品。遵义磷肥厂，不仅为本省农业生产服务，而且曾供应湖南、湖北、四川、河南、山西等地磷肥。去年以来，这个厂注意了综合利用，现在并生产硫酸、硫磺、水泥等工业生产原料。遵义市的火柴也供应四川、云南等地。
    1958年的大跃进，冲破了遵义市只有轻工业和加工工业的局面。这里成为贵州省钢铁基地之一，新建的九、五、四型钢铁企业的基建工程已近尾声。原只生产锰矿粉的锰矿厂，已扩建成合金厂。遵义市的机械工业，解放前也是一张白纸，全市没有一台车床，只有几把虎头钳子和几把锉，经过几年的发展壮大，特别是去年的跃进，现在已有七十部车床，生产能力达一万吨，能够生产小型工作母机、小洋高炉的部分设备。目前遵义市正在进行着史无前例的建设事业。遵义市的劳动人民，将不辜负遵义市在历史上的光辉业绩，定把自己的城市建设得更美好、更光辉灿烂。川黔铁路明年通车以后，南来北往的旅客，在他们怀着崇敬和激动的心情参观“遵义会议”纪念馆的时候，还会同时看到一个新型的美丽的城市。
