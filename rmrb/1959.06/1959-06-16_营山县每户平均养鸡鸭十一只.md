Ying Shan County averages eleven chickens and ducks per household
The Chinese Communist Party, Ying Shan County Committee, Sichuan Province

While achieving a large increase in steel and grain production last year, Ying Shan County, Sichuan Province, also witnessed great development in poultry production. By the end of 1958, the county had 924,570 chickens and ducks, averaging 7.4 per household, an increase of 38.94% compared to the end of 1957. By the end of April this year, the number of chickens and ducks had increased to 1,424,024, averaging 11.5 per household, an increase of 103.6% compared to before the establishment of the people's communes. As a result of the large-scale development of poultry, the state, the communes, and the farmers have all benefited greatly. In 1958, the county produced approximately 5 million catties of chicken and duck eggs, supplying more than 600,000 catties to the Hechuan Egg Factory and cities such as Chongqing and Nanchong, more than 1.15 million catties to towns in the county, and also purchasing 19,300 catties of duck feathers. In 1958, the total output value of chickens and ducks in the county reached 2,809,500 yuan, accounting for 4.52% of the total agricultural output value, with an average income of 23.4 yuan per farmer from chickens and ducks. In the third team and first squad of the Guanyin People's Commune, income from selling chickens, ducks, and eggs alone amounted to 3,611 yuan, and 157 pieces of clothing were sewn; in addition, many problems such as buying salt, buying oil, buying fertilizer, office expenses, and tuition fees were solved. Because the income from developing poultry has increased a lot, the masses are satisfied, saying, "Raising a few chickens and ducks makes things easy"; "The benefits of chickens and ducks are endless, and there is always pocket money available," which further encourages their enthusiasm for developing poultry production.

In developing chickens and ducks, we mainly have the following experiences:

	Emphasis on both public and private raising

Of the existing chickens in the county, 95.9% are privately owned by commune members, and collectively raised chickens account for 4.1%; about 40% of ducks are collectively raised, and 60% are privately owned. At the beginning of communization, it was the peak season for autumn hatching of chickens and ducks. The county party committee analyzed the situation at the time and held several discussions on the issue of developing chickens and ducks, believing that it was necessary to continue to strengthen the leadership of this work. At the same time, it was decided to conscientiously implement the provincial party committee's instructions on giving equal importance to public and private raising, allowing commune members to raise poultry privately, and quickly informing the masses of this policy. Then, a soaring-forward rally on raising chickens and ducks was universally held, and rural cadres and the masses throughout the county were organized to seriously discuss the notification from the rural work department of the provincial party committee on developing poultry with equal emphasis on public and private sectors, and it was clearly announced that chickens and ducks would not be included in the commune, and all income from chickens and ducks raised by commune members would belong to them. In order to help commune members solve the difficulties of raising chickens and ducks privately, 3 catties of grain were allocated for each privately owned chicken and duck, and 3 catties of grain or broken rice were supplied for each brood of chicks hatched, and some bran was also distributed to commune members who raised more private chickens and ducks. At the same time, we actively planned to vigorously develop collective chicken raising, establishing "ten thousand chicken mountains" and "thousand chicken farms" according to different conditions, and vigorously promoted the universal raising of chickens in canteens. At present, the county has 25 "ten thousand chicken mountains," 34 "thousand chicken farms," 143 small collective chicken farms, and one Leghorn chicken and Beijing duck breeding farm each. Many canteens have started raising chickens. Because we adhered to the principle of walking on two legs, both public and private poultry have increased rapidly. In order to promote the development of poultry production at a higher speed, the county party committee timely proposed the slogan of "every commune raises chickens, every team raises chickens, every household raises chickens, and everyone in government agencies, schools, and factories raises chickens." According to this spirit, we adopted a combination of decentralized and small-scale centralized feeding, a combination of urban and rural feeding (the agencies and factories in the county seat alone raise more than 2,300 chickens and ducks), and a combination of professional and sideline feeding methods, and a high tide of raising chickens and ducks by the whole people has now been formed in the county.

	Wide Source of Fodder

Facts tell us that the saying "Chickens and ducks exchange eggs for grain, and it is difficult to do without grain" is incorrect; as long as we rely on the masses to find ways to tap potential, the source of feed is infinite. Over the past year or so, we have continuously summarized the masses' experience in solving the problem of feed, and promoted more than 30 kinds of substitute feed, using very little grain, and chickens and ducks have still developed greatly. We mainly grasped the five methods of "reserving, planting, collecting, creating, and grazing" to solve the feed problem. Reserve: that is, the commune allocates a certain amount of broken rice, leftovers, and other concentrated feed, and a certain amount of agricultural and sideline product bran feed. Plant: that is, the larger collective chicken farms demarcate some slopes and poor land to plant feed, and at the same time mobilize the masses to use the space in front of and behind their houses to plant feed. Collect: that is, widely collect wild feed, such as collecting green grass, wild prickly pears, picking snails, and catching pests. The Heimashan Chicken Farm in the Laolin People's Commune picked more than 700 catties of snails and more than 2,100 catties of wild prickly pears in January and February, solving most of the feed needed for 1,200 chickens. The Chenshou Commune Chicken Farm has 600 ducks. If they relied on feeding grain, they would need 50 catties a day, but because two elderly people pick more than 100 catties of snails every day, feeding only 4 catties of leftover grain is enough, and the ducks grow very well. Create: that is, artificially breed insects. Pile up compost, turf, or cow dung, grain chaff, and sewage for ten days, and a large number of insects will grow inside. Graze: that is, after the grain is harvested, plan to drive poultry to empty fields and empty land for grazing, and usually they can also be driven to barren slopes and lawns for grazing.

	Chickens and Ducks Can Not Damage Crops

The contradiction between chickens and ducks damaging crops can be resolved. According to the characteristics of "chickens land, ducks water," the masses created a three-pronged approach of "closing, blocking, and releasing." In the county's large-scale development of chickens and ducks, crops have not suffered major damage. Close: that is, in the three stages of newly planted crops, seedlings, and maturity, each household should keep their chickens and ducks in the courtyard and take good care of them; in places where residents are relatively concentrated and there are many chickens and ducks, several households can jointly concentrate their chickens and ducks together and have them taken care of by an elderly person or child, which is called centralized management of private feeding. Block: bamboo fences are woven on both sides of the roads between residential areas and fields to prevent chickens and ducks from eating grain in the fields. Release: ducks are driven to ponds and streams for grazing; chickens can also be trained from an early age to be driven to barren slopes and lawns for grazing. However, while closing, blocking, and releasing, it is necessary to ensure that chickens and ducks are well fed, and chickens and ducks cannot be starved; otherwise, the goal of developing more and laying more eggs will not be achieved. Therefore, it is necessary to closely combine closing, blocking, and releasing with solving the feed problem.

	Arrange for Breeding Chickens and Hatching Eggs

Last winter and this spring, the county launched a mass movement to vigorously incubate poultry. The county party committee held successive telephone conferences to deploy and inspect the work. Each commune held one or two on-site chicken hatching meetings. With the party committee's call, the cadres taking the lead, and the enthusiastic response of the masses, as of now, more than 860,000 chicks and ducklings have been hatched in the county. We have adopted the following methods: (1) widely called on the masses to "not kill chickens during the New Year, but keep them to hatch chicks," "temporarily eat fewer chicken and duck eggs, and develop four million," which laid a good ideological and material preparation for the incubation movement; (2) adopted the methods of "roosters walking into households" (note: that is, carrying roosters to people's doors for mating) and "adjusting hatching eggs" to solve the problem of insufficient breeding chickens and hatching eggs; (3) adopted a combination of natural incubation and artificial incubation to speed up the breeding rate and free up hens to lay more eggs. The county adopted five artificial incubation methods: stir-fried grain incubation, greenhouse incubation, hot water incubation, fire incubation, and electric incubation. The Xiaoqiao Commune also created a method that combines hen incubation and artificial incubation. In the past, a hen could only incubate more than 20 eggs at a time. Now, by using artificial bottom heating, it can incubate 50 to 120 eggs at a time. The county is vigorously promoting this method.

	Eliminate Pests and Diseases

In order to eliminate chicken and duck diseases, it is necessary to do a good job in "three preventions" and "three disinfections." The three preventions are: (1) using one ounce of realgar, one clove of garlic, and one qian of licorice, mixed with white wine to feed chickens, can prevent hydremia; (2) using one ounce of realgar and one clove of garlic, ground finely, diluted with boiling water to feed chickens, can prevent hard throat; (3) timely locking up the diseased chickens in water can prevent inflammation. The three disinfections are: (1) when hatching chicks, sprinkle one qian of 666 powder under the hen's wings to avoid lice; (2) using two cloves of garlic, two liang of rhubarb, one liang of realgar, and one liang of licorice, ground finely, add a little distiller's yeast, and mix it into the feed to feed chickens can prevent epidemics; (3) using two liang of bleaching powder, one liang of 666 powder, lime, or wood ash sprinkled in the chicken coop can reduce the spread of epidemics. At the same time, various places have also summarized more than a dozen effective local methods for preventing and treating chicken and duck diseases, and combined with the pest elimination and disease eradication movement to do a good job in cleaning and hygiene, greatly reducing the mortality rate of chickens and ducks due to epidemics.

Our current task is to consolidate the existing achievements and strive for greater development in poultry production, and to strive to overfulfill this year's plan to develop four million poultry. (Attached picture)

    营山县每户平均养鸡鸭十一只
    中共四川省营山县委员会
    四川营山县在去年钢铁、粮食大增产的同时，家禽生产也获得了大发展。1958年底，全县实有鸡鸭九十二万四千五百七十只，平均每户七点四只，比1957年底增加38.94％。到今年4月底止，鸡鸭已增加到一百四十二万四千零二十四只，平均每户十一点五只，比建公社前增加了103.6％。由于家禽大发展的结果，国家、公社、农民都得到了很大的好处。全县1958年约产鸡鸭蛋五百万斤，供应合川蛋厂及重庆、南充等城市六十余万斤，供应本县城镇一百一十五万余斤，还收购了鸭毛一万九千三百斤。1958年全县鸡鸭产值达二百八十万九千五百元，占农业总产值的4.52％，每一农户平均鸡鸭收入二十三元四角。观音人民公社三大队一小队去年仅卖鸡鸭和蛋收入即三千六百一十一元，缝衣一百五十七件；此外，还解决了买盐、买油、买肥料、办公用费、学费等很多问题。由于发展家禽收入增加很多，所以群众都满意地说：“鸡鸭喂几个，手头很松活”；
  “鸡鸭好处说不完，经常不缺零用钱”，这样就更进一步地鼓舞了他们发展家禽生产的积极性。
    在发展鸡鸭中，我们主要有以下几点体会：
                公养私养并重
    全县现有鸡只中95.9％是属于社员私人所有，集体饲养的鸡占4.1％；鸭子集体养的约占40％，私有的占60％。公社化之初，正是秋孵鸡鸭旺季，县委分析了当时情况，对发展鸡鸭问题作了多次讨论，认为必须继续加强这一工作的领导，同时决定认真贯彻执行省委关于公养私养并重的指示，允许社员私养家禽，并且迅速让群众了解这个政策。接着便普遍召开了养鸡养鸭跃进大会，组织全县农村干部和群众认真讨论了省委农村工作部关于公私并重发展家禽的通知，并明确宣布了鸡鸭不入社，社员饲养的鸡鸭收入全部归自己。为了帮助社员解决私人养鸡养鸭的困难，1958年分配时给社员私有鸡鸭每只留粮三斤，孵抱小鸡一窝供应粮食或碎米三斤，社员私养鸡鸭较多的还分给一定的统糠。与此同时，我们又积极规划了大力发展集体养鸡，根据条件不同分别建立万鸡山、千鸡场，大力提倡食堂普遍养鸡。目前全县已有万鸡山二十五处，千鸡场三十四处，小型集体养鸡场一百四十三处和莱亨鸡、北京鸭良种场各一个，不少食堂都养起了鸡。由于坚持了两条腿走路的方针，使公、私家禽都得到了迅速的增加。为了促进家禽生产更高速度地发展，县委适时地提出了“社社养鸡，队队养鸡，户户养鸡，机关、学校、工厂大家都养鸡”的号召。根据这一精神，采取了“分散与小集中饲养相结合；城镇与农村饲养相结合（仅县城各机关、工厂就养了鸡鸭二千三百余只）；专业与副业饲养相结合的办法，目前已在全县形成了一个全民养鸡养鸭的高潮。
                饲料来源宽广
    事实告诉我们：“鸡鸭蛋谷米换，没有粮食不好办”的说法是不正确的；只要依靠群众想办法挖潜力，饲料的来源是无穷的。一年多来，我们不断地总结了群众解决饲料的经验，推广了代用饲料三十多种，只用了很少的粮食，鸡鸭还是大大地发展起来了。我们主要抓住了“留、种、采、造、放”五种办法解决了饲料问题。留：就是公社分配给一定的碎米、脚粮等精料，和一定的农副产物糠麸饲料。种：就是比较大的集体养鸡场划一些边坡孬地种饲料，同时发动群众利用屋前屋后空隙地种饲料。采：就是广泛采集野生饲料，如采青草、野次果、拣螺蛳、捉害虫等。老林公社黑马山养鸡场在一、二月份拣了螺蛳七百多斤，采野次果二千一百多斤，解决了一千二百多只鸡所需的绝大部分饲料问题。城守公社养鸡场有六百只鸭子，如果靠喂粮食，每天即需五十斤，但由于两个老年人每天拣螺蛳一百余斤，只喂四斤脚粮就够了，而且鸭子长得很好。造：就是人工繁殖昆虫。用堆肥、草皮或牛粪、谷糠加污水沤十天，里边就能长出大批虫子。放：就是在粮食收获后，有计划地把家禽赶到空田、空土上放牧，平时还可以赶到荒坡草坪上去放牧。
            鸡鸭可以不损害庄稼
    鸡鸭损害庄稼的矛盾是可以解决的。根据“鸡着陆、鸭着水”的特点，群众创造了“关、拦、?”三结合的办法，在全县鸡鸭大发展的情况下，庄稼并没有遭到大的损害。关：就是在农作物刚下种、禾苗、成熟三个阶段，让各户把鸡鸭关在院坝中，看管好；在住户比较集中，鸡鸭较多的地方，几户可以联合把鸡鸭集中在一起，由一个老年或儿童看管，这叫做私人喂养集中管理。拦：在住户通田间的走道两旁编竹笆拦住，不让鸡鸭到地里吃粮食。?：把鸭子赶到池塘、溪河游放；鸡也可以从小训练养成习惯，赶到荒坡、草坪林地内去放牧。但是，在关、拦、?的同时，必须保证鸡鸭吃得饱，不能让鸡鸭挨着饿；不然，就达不到多发展多下蛋的目的。所以必须把关、拦、?和解决好饲料问题密切结合起来。
                安排种鸡种蛋
    去冬今春全县开展了群众性的大搞家禽孵化运动。县委连续召开电话会议进行布置和检查，各公社都开过一、两次孵鸡现场会，在党委号召、干部带头、群众热烈响应的情况下，截至目前全县已孵出小鸡小鸭八十六万余只。我们曾经采用了以下的办法：（1）广泛号召群众“过年不杀鸡，留着孵小鸡”、
  “暂时少吃鸡鸭蛋，发展四百万”，给孵化运动作好了思想上和物质上的准备；（2）采用“公鸡走人户”（按：即携带公鸡上门配种）和“调剂种蛋”办法解决了种鸡种蛋不足问题；（3）采用自然孵化与人工孵化并重的办法，加快繁殖速度，腾出母鸡多下蛋。全县采用了炒谷孵、温室孵、热水孵、火孵、电孵等五种人工孵化的办法。小桥公社还创造了母鸡孵和人工孵相结合的办法，过去一只母鸡一次只能孵二十多个蛋，现在采用人工底层加温的办法，一次可以孵五十至一百二十个蛋。全县正在大力推广这种办法。
                  除害灭病
    为了消除鸡鸭的病害，要做好“三防”和“三消毒”工作。三防是：（1）用雄黄一两、大蒜一瓣、甘草一钱，混合白酒喂鸡，可防清水症；（2）用雄黄一两、大蒜一瓣磨细，兑开水喂鸡，可防硬喉症；
  （3）适时把病鸡关在水里可防炎症。三消毒是：（1）孵小鸡时用六六六粉一钱撒在母鸡翅膀下，免生虱子；（2）用大蒜两瓣、大黄二两、雄黄一两、甘草一两磨细，兑少许酒曲，掺在饲料内喂鸡能预防疫病；
  （3）用漂白粉二两、六六六粉一两、石灰或草木灰撒在鸡舍内，可减少疫病传染。同时各地还总结了十余种土法防治鸡鸭病的有效办法，并结合除害灭病运动搞好清洁卫生，大大减少了鸡鸭疫病死亡现象。
    当前我们的任务是巩固现有成绩，力争家禽生产更大的发展，为超额完成今年发展四百万只家禽的计划而奋斗。（附图片）
