    Printmaking

    Printmaking is an independent art form in the visual arts, with tools, expressive methods, and production processes that differ from other forms of painting. At the same time, it can reproduce the original work many times, which can expand its circulation.

    Printmaking includes many varieties, such as woodcut prints, linocuts, lithographs, copperplate engravings, plaster prints, and other types. In the Soviet Union and many other countries, watercolors, ink paintings, propaganda posters, etc., are also included in the field of printmaking.

    Woodcut prints are the most familiar. Yangliuqing's prints are one type of woodcut print. Woodcut prints originated the earliest; woodcut prints appeared soon after woodblock printing technology was developed. The late Ming Dynasty was the golden age of Chinese woodcut art. Ancient woodcut prints were used to reproduce original paintings. The carvers and painters had separate roles, and the carved paintings could only be said to be reproductions of paintings. After the Ming Dynasty, carvers and painters began to cooperate closely. The painter's brushstrokes and the carver's knife techniques communicated and integrated with each other. What was carved out was not only lifelike in form, but also in spirit.

    In modern printmaking, both "painting" and "carving" are done by the artist alone. In this way, the drawing and carving of printmaking become a continuous creative process for the printmaking artist.

    Printmaking does not always involve carving with a knife. For example, some copperplate engravings are made using etching methods.

    版画
    版画是造型艺术中一个独立的画种，它应用的工具、表现方法、制作过程，都与其他绘画有所不同。同时它能够把原作复印许多份，可以扩大流传范围。
    版画包括好多种类：如木板画、麻胶版画、石版画、铜版画、石膏版画等品种。在苏联和其他许多国家，把水彩、水墨画、宣传画等，也都纳入版画的领域之内。
    木板画是大家最熟悉的。杨柳青的版画，就是木板画中的一种。木板画产生的最早，自从有了木板印刷术不久，就出现了木板画。明代后期是我国木刻艺术的黄金时代。古代的木刻版画是用来复制绘画原作，刻制者和画家是分工的，刻出来的画只能说是绘画的复制品。明代以后刻工和画家开始了密切的合作，画家的笔法和刻工的刀法画互相交流到互相贯通，刻出来的由不仅仅是形似，而且形神兼备了。
    现代的版画，“画”和“刻”都是出自画家一人之手，这样，版画的画、刻，就成了版画作者的一个连续创作过程。
    版画并不都是用刀刻，如有的铜版画竟是用腐蚀的办法制做出来的。
