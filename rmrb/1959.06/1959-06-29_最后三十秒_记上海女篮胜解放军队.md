    The Last Thirty Seconds
    ——Shanghai Women's Basketball Team Defeats the People's Liberation Army Team
    Fifty-five to fifty-three. In the last thirty seconds, the Shanghai Women's Basketball Team defeated the People's Liberation Army Women's Basketball Team by two points, winning the women's basketball championship in the Hangzhou competition zone of the National Games preliminary round. This heated battle, lasting thirty-six minutes, captivated nearly four thousand spectators from beginning to end.
    Since the beginning of the preliminary round, both teams had achieved five wins in five games, securing their place in the finals. To win the championship, both sides made full preparations ideologically and tactically. During the intense match, the players' enthusiasm and skills were basically brought into full play, resulting in a game that was both courageous and fast, skillful and steady.
    At the start of the game, both sides faced a strong opponent and sent their main players onto the court. The People's Liberation Army team used a fast-break double center lineup composed of four athletes—Xu Min, Wang Wenjing, Chen Changfeng, and Cao Ruoxian—and Shi Wenyuan; the Shanghai team, consisting of four athletes—Sheng Dani, Xu Jianhua, Wang Huizhu, and Xu Weili—and main player Chen Minying, countered with a reactive zone defense. The jump ball at center court was fiercely contested. After one minute, Wang Huizhu of the Shanghai team and Chen Changfeng of the People's Liberation Army team each made a free throw, tying the score at one to one. The People's Liberation Army team then launched several fast breaks, with centers Xu Min and Wang Wenjing repeatedly succeeding with pass-and-cut plays, taking a seven to four lead. The Shanghai team called a timeout, replacing a player with athlete Wang Peizhen. The five athletes on the court actively strengthened their defense, tightly man-marking; while also rebounding and launching fast breaks. The situation improved slightly. They once closed the gap to twelve to fourteen, trailing by only one point. Later, the People's Liberation Army team also brought in athlete Ge Li. At this point, the ten tigers on the court competed fiercely, with the lead changing hands several times. At the halftime buzzer, the People's Liberation Army team led by thirty to twenty-five.
    Both sides regrouped, switched sides, and fought again, with short-range engagements and successive climaxes. The result was thirty-one to thirty-one. At this moment, the People's Liberation Army team immediately launched a fierce attack. Forwards Xu Min and Chen Changfeng were unstoppable, creating exciting scenes of intercepting passes and launching fast breaks, once leading the Shanghai team by ten points at forty-three to thirty-three. The Shanghai team adopted its consistent rotation strategy, calmly responding to the challenge. Wang Peizhen repeatedly scored with several mid-range shots, closing the gap to forty-eight to forty-eight, drawing applause from the audience. Soon after, the two sides fought more fiercely. Xie Yunyi of the Shanghai team jumped under the basket, scoring two more points, and Wang Wenjing of the People's Liberation Army team made a free throw. At this point, the buzzer had already sounded, and there were only three minutes left in the game. The score on the court was fifty to forty-nine, with the Shanghai team leading by one point.
    The moment of decision had arrived. The Shanghai team, eager to win, committed a foul while trying to grab the ball. Ge Li of the People's Liberation Army team made a free throw, tying the score at fifty, the fourth time the score had been tied. The People's Liberation Army team called a timeout to plan their final battle. With only two minutes left in the game, the atmosphere was extremely tense. Both teams committed fouls and took free throws, successively tying the score again at fifty-one and fifty-three, making it difficult to determine the winner. With only thirty seconds left, Xu Min of the People's Liberation Army team carelessly committed a blocking foul, and Sheng Dani of the Shanghai team made a free throw, scoring one point. From the baseline, the People's Liberation Army team quickly passed the ball to launch a counterattack, trying to reverse the defeat. Unexpectedly, just as the ball was passed out, it was intercepted by the Shanghai team's forward. After a few quick passes, just as Wang Bixiu was about to cut in for a layup, Ge Li of the People's Liberation Army team committed a hand-checking foul, and the final buzzer sounded. Wang Bixiu made another free throw, and the Shanghai team finally defeated the strong People's Liberation Army team by two points in the tense final moments, winning the championship of the Hangzhou competition zone of the preliminary round.
