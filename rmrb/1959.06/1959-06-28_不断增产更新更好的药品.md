    Constantly Increase Production and Update Better Medicines
    (Our dispatch) Since liberation, China's pharmaceutical industry has made great progress.
    In 1952, China built its first medium-sized factory for producing antibiotics. It was gradually expanded afterward, and in five years the factory's penicillin production increased 750-fold. In 1958, the North China Pharmaceutical Factory, a joint antibiotic enterprise built with Soviet assistance, went into production, which further promoted the development of China's antibiotic industry. Currently, several of the most commonly used antibiotics in clinical practice, such as penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, and tetracycline, are all produced in large quantities in China. Last year, new products such as erythromycin, polymyxin, and nystatin were also successfully trial-produced. Through the collaboration of antibiotic workers across the country, the method of producing oxytetracycline feed through solid-state fermentation has created favorable conditions for the indigenous production of livestock antibiotics and their widespread application in rural areas.
    At present, the total output of sulfonamide drugs has reached a relatively high international level. In addition, anti-tuberculosis drugs such as isoniazid, and many drugs for preventing and treating diseases and endemic diseases that seriously endanger people's health, such as potassium antimony tartrate for schistosomiasis, sodium antimony gluconate for leishmaniasis, carbarsone for filariasis, and various anthelmintic and antimalarial drugs, have all begun production.
    After the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, hospitals, health stations, and other institutions have been universally established throughout the country, and the demand for medicines in society has suddenly increased. To meet the urgent needs of the people, the pharmaceutical industry put forward the fighting slogan of "hard work for three years, changing the face." On the one hand, it is stepping up the construction and expansion of large enterprises, including the Taiyuan Sulfonamide Joint Enterprise recently built with Soviet assistance, to form a national production base network. Each year, it will be able to increase production of hundreds of tons of various antibiotics and vitamins, thousands of tons of various sulfonamides, antipyretic drugs, and caffeine produced by total chemical synthesis. After these factories are put into production this year, the output of several major products can basically meet the needs of the Chinese people. On the other hand, it is vigorously strengthening the research and trial production of new products. Many products that were previously considered unattainable, such as vitamin C, B1, pantothenic acid, folic acid, and vitamin A, B2, B6, D2, and other synthesis production technologies, are now either being trial-produced or have been put into production. The output of vitamin B12 has already met domestic needs. As for steroidal hormones, due to the mobilization and adjustment of relevant research and technical forces throughout the country, rich steroidal plant raw material resources have been found in less than a year, and a new chemical synthesis route for corticosterone has been successfully researched, paving the way for further manufacturing newer and better products.
    Traditional Chinese medicine is a treasure trove of pharmacological experience in China for thousands of years. This treasure trove must be sorted out and explored using scientific analysis methods. At present, the work of studying traditional Chinese medicine has been universally carried out throughout the country. (Attached picture)

    不断增产更新更好的药品
    本报讯　解放几年来，我国医药工业有很大发展。
    1952年我国建成第一个生产抗菌素的中型工厂。以后逐步扩建，五年间这个厂的青霉素产量增加了七百五十倍。1958年，苏联帮助我国建设的抗菌素联合企业——华北药厂投入生产以后，就更有力地推动了我国抗菌素工业的发展。目前临床上最常应用的几种抗菌素如青霉素、链霉素、合霉素、金霉素、土霉素和四囨素等都已在我国大量生产。去年还试制成功了红霉素、多粘菌素、制霉菌素等新产品。通过全国抗菌素工作者的协作，用固体发酵生产出土霉素饲料的方法，更为畜用抗菌素的土法生产和在农村中广泛应用创造了有利条件。
    目前磺胺类药物的生产的总产量，已经达到了国际上较高的水平。而抗结核药，如异烟肼和许多防治严重危害人民健康的疾病和地方病的药物，如治疗血吸虫病的酒石酸锑钾、治疗黑热病的葡萄糖酸锑钠、治疗丝虫病的卡巴胂和多种驱虫药、抗疟药等，都已开始生产。
    工农业大跃进以后，医院、保健站等机构在各地普遍建立起来，社会上需要的药品突然增加。为了满足人民的迫切要求，医药工业提出“苦干三年、改变面貌”的战斗口号。一方面加紧新建和扩建大型企业，其中包括最近由苏联帮助我国建设的太原磺胺联合企业，组成全国生产基地网，每年将能增产数以百吨计的各种抗菌素、维生素，数以千吨计的各种磺胺、解热药以及用全化学合成方法生产的咖啡因等。这些工厂今年投入生产后，几种主要产品的产量就可以基本上满足我国人民的需要。另一方面，正在大力加强新产品的研究试制工作。许多从前认为高不可攀的产品，例如，维生素C、B1，泛酸和叶酸以及维生素A、B2、B6、D2等的合成生产技术，现在有的正在试制，有的已投入生产。而维生素B12产量已经满足了国内的需要。甾体激素，由于动员和调整了全国有关的研究技术力量，在不到一年的时间里，找到了丰富的含甾体植物原料资源，研究成功了皮质酮新的化学合成途径，为进一步制造更新更好的产品铺平了道路。
    中医中药是我国几千年来药物治疗学的经验宝藏，这个宝藏必须用科学分析方法来加以整理和发掘。目前研究中医中药的工作已经在全国普遍开展起来。（附图片）
