    Actively Lead the Discussion of Dense Planting Issues

    The season for sowing late rice and late autumn crops is approaching. Rural cadres and commune members, based on past experience in increasing production, are enthusiastically discussing the dense planting specifications for late rice and late autumn crops, and further implementing various measures to increase production. This is very necessary. Dense planting is the central link in agricultural production increase measures, and whether dense planting is reasonable or not is extremely important for agricultural production increase. Through discussion, it is possible to find dense planting specifications suitable for local conditions and to make a comprehensive plan for various production increase measures closely related to dense planting. This is of great significance for carrying out the late autumn and late rice production increase campaign and for ensuring a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

    The most debated issue in dense planting is how dense is considered reasonable. The Party Central Committee has already given clear instructions on this issue, and this newspaper also published an editorial on April 1 to discuss this issue. The general principle is "reasonable dense planting, adapting to local conditions." In specific implementation, it is necessary to make regulations suitable for local conditions according to different times and places.

    During this period, in extensive and in-depth discussions, various regions have researched some relatively reasonable opinions on dense planting of late rice. For example, in areas with fertile soil and sufficient water and fertilizer conditions, the degree of dense planting should be greater; in areas with barren soil and poor water and fertilizer conditions, the density should be smaller. Where the level of field management technology is high, the density can be greater; where the level of field management technology is low, the density can be smaller. For varieties with weak tillering and branching performance, the density should be greater; for varieties with strong tillering and branching performance, the density should be smaller. Of course, it is impossible to draw a completely scientific and detailed conclusion in such a short period of time. However, some noteworthy situations have also occurred in the discussions in various regions. That is, some people lack experience and demand density in one go, but often do not consider the closely related conditions such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and labor, or even if they do consider them, they make overly high estimates of these conditions, deviating from reality, thereby establishing dense planting specifications on the basis of subjective imagination. This may lead to the danger of reduced production due to excessive density. Another group of people have seen the phenomenon of reduced production due to excessive dense planting of late rice in some areas last year, and they are skeptical of dense planting, even wanting to cancel dense planting and return to the old road of sparse planting. When discussing the dense planting specifications for late rice in individual areas, some people advocated that the spacing between plants and rows should only be seven or eight inches, and no denser. Is this really the case? Of course not. The reason why they want sparse planting is also because they have not seen the changed conditions and blindly brought out the experience of sparse planting, which is also detached from reality. Obviously, the above two views have a common point, that is, they isolate dense planting and regard it as a simple problem of plant spacing and row spacing, without comprehensively studying the various production increase measures related to it, and without correctly estimating the favorable objective conditions and subjective efforts, so it is naturally difficult to draw correct conclusions. This incident once again teaches us that nothing can be done without Marxism. Dense planting is a technical problem, but it must also be linked with other production increase measures, linked with the local specific conditions, and when analyzing objective conditions, it is necessary to look at both the existing actual situation and the new changes that may occur. Only in this way can we avoid blindness and one-sidedness, and draw scientific conclusions on the issue of dense planting.

    When discussing the issue of dense planting, various regions organized experienced old farmers, young people who are willing to accept advanced technology, and middle-aged farmers to discuss together, so that they could express their opinions and develop the wisdom of the masses. This is very good. The Party Central Committee has pointed out: When discussing the issue of dense planting,

    Young, middle-aged, and old farmers should meet and discuss together,

    And jointly determine the appropriate density. Because the promotion of any

    New technical measure must first be agreed upon by the broad masses,

    And now old farmers are more skeptical about dense planting,

    Some middle-aged farmers are skeptical, and some are not.

    Only through discussion can a consensus be reached on dense planting. Speaking of this, we cannot but talk about the experience of older farmers and the enthusiasm of young farmers. Older farmers have had many successful experiences and failures in long-term production practice, and these experiences and lessons are worthy of our attention. However, it should also be estimated that some of them often underestimate the new conditions that have changed in the current agricultural field, underestimate the new experiences of improving soil, deep plowing, increasing fertilizer application, improving water conservancy, selecting improved varieties, and improving tools, and underestimate the enthusiasm of the masses. This makes their experience somewhat limited. If we do not analyze it and act according to the limited experience, it will inevitably make things that could have been done well not done well. Therefore, the experience of old farmers should be listened to, but it is by no means unconditionally accepted without analysis. The situation of young farmers is the opposite of the above-mentioned old farmers. They are brave in accepting new things and see the new conditions very clearly. However, they often underestimate how much the new conditions can play in actual production. In their work, they often act only on the basis of enthusiasm, resulting in detachment from reality. Therefore, to do things well, to combine experience and enthusiasm, it is necessary to give full play to the advantages of old farmers, young farmers, and middle-aged farmers in all aspects. The example of the Party branch of the Second Cultivation Zone of the Hongguang Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, organizing commune members to discuss reasonable dense planting is a good one. At the discussion meeting, old farmer Liu Haizhou said: "To grow crops, you have to look at the sky, the land, and the effort. Last year, each mu was densely planted with 30,000 seedlings, and the harvest was very good, but the same land planted with 100,000 seedlings per mu resulted in reduced production." He believes that this year's specifications should still be maintained at 30,000 seedlings per mu. Some young farmers also agreed with his opinion, saying that excessive density is not good, but they believe that this year's conditions such as fertilizer, pest control, and technology have improved, so it is possible to plant more densely than last year. As a result of the discussion, everyone agreed to combine the old experience with the new technology, and specifically planned the reasonable dense planting specifications for each field.

    Regarding the planting density of various crops, the Party Central Committee has clearly instructed that the leading organs cannot rigidly stipulate it, but must be decided by the masses through consultation. We must not waver in this principle. However, does this mean that the leading organs do not need to intervene in agricultural technology at all? No, leadership must be strengthened. Experience has proved that the more specific the leadership in a region (of course, not rigid and simplistic leadership, let alone subjectivist leadership that is divorced from the masses), the greater the increase in agricultural production; the lack of strong leadership in this area results in smaller production increases. Now, some comrades dare not even put forward an objectively based regulation for mass reference on such a major technical measure as dense planting. This is of course wrong. In order to strengthen leadership, the local Party committees should currently do such a thing, that is, after earnestly consulting with the masses, put forward a dense planting plan for the masses to refer to, and then let each contracting unit conduct extensive and full discussions, and then make their own decisions and take various effective measures, organize forces, and implement them. Only in this way can we make our late rice and late autumn crops achieve the maximum reasonable dense planting, so that we can both avoid the losses suffered by some places last year due to excessive density, and not return to the old path of excessive sparse planting in the past.

### 积极领导开展密植问题的讨论

    积极领导开展密植问题的讨论
    晚稻、晚秋的播种季节就要到来了。广大农村干部和社员群众根据过去的增产经验正在热烈讨论晚稻和晚秋作物的密植规格，进一步贯彻各项增产措施。这是非常必要的。密植是农业增产措施的中心环节，密植合理与否对农业增产关系极大。通过讨论，就可以找出适合当地情况的密植规格，并且作出与密植紧密相关的各项增产措施的全面规划。这样，对开展晚秋、晚稻的增产运动，对保证今年农业生产的丰收，都有很大的意义。
    在密植问题上争论得最多的是密到什么程度才算合理。关于这个问题，党中央已经有明确的指示，本报也曾在4月1日发表社论来论述这个问题。总的原则是“合理密植，因地制宜”。具体执行起来，就要因时因地不同，作出适合当地条件的规定。
    在此期间，各地在广泛深入的讨论中，对于晚稻密植研究出了一些比较合理的意见。例如，土壤肥沃，水肥条件充足的地区，密植程度要大些；土壤瘠薄，水肥条件较差的地区，密度就要小些。田间管理技术水平较高的，密度可大些；田间管理技术水平较低的，密度可小些。分蘖分枝性能弱的品种，密度要大些；分蘖分枝性能强的品种，密度要小些。当然，在这样短的时间内，要得出一个完全科学的详尽无遗的结论，是不可能的。但是，各地的讨论中，也发生了一些值得注意的情况，这就是一部分人缺少经验，一股劲儿要求密，可是对水、肥、土、种、劳力等等密切相关的条件，则往往不加考虑，或者虽然考虑了，但对这些条件作出了过高的估计，脱离了实际，从而把密植规格建立在主观想像的基础上。这样，就有可能造成过密减产的危险。另有一部分人看到了去年某些地区晚稻种植过密，以致减产的现象，对密植产生怀疑，甚至想取消密植，回到稀植的老路。个别地区讨论晚稻密植规格的时候，就有人主张株行距只能七寸或八寸，不能再密。事实真是这样么？当然不是。他们所以要稀植，同样也是没有看到已经变化了的条件，而盲目地搬出了稀植经验，这同样是脱离实际。很显然，以上两种看法有一个共同点，都是把密植孤立起来，看成是个单纯的株距和行距问题，没有把与此相关的各项增产措施综合起来研究，没有正确地估计到有利的客观条件和主观努力，这样自然很难得出正确的结论。从这件事情上又一次教育我们，任何事情离开马克思主义是不行的。密植是个技术性的问题，可是也必须把密植和其他各项增产措施联系起来，把密植和当地的具体条件联系起来，并且在分析客观条件时既要看现有的实际情况，又要看到可能发生的新的变化，只有这样，才能避免盲目性，片面性，才能在密植问题上作出合乎科学的结论。
    各地在讨论密植问题的时候，把有丰富经验的老农和勇于接受先进技术的青年，以及中年农民组织在一起讨论，让他们各抒己见，发扬群众的智慧。这是很好的。党中央已经指出：讨论密植问题，
    要青年、中年和老年农民一起开会商量，
    共同规定适当的密度。因为推广任何一
    种新的技术措施，都首先必须得到广大
    群众同意，而现在老农对密植怀疑的比
    较多，中年农民中有怀疑的，也有不怀
    疑的。只有经过讨论，对密植才能取得一致的看法。说到这里，不能不谈谈对老年农民的经验和青年农民的热情的看法问题。老年农民在长期的生产实践中，有过许许多多成功的经验和失败的教训，这些经验和教训是值得我们重视的。但是，也应当估计到，在他们当中有些人往往对于当前农业方面已经改变了的新的条件估计不足，对改良土壤、深耕、增施肥料、改善水利、选用良种、改良工具等新的经验估计不足，对群众的干劲也估计不足。这就使得他们的经验带有某些局限性。如果不加分析，按照带有局限性的经验办事，必然使得本来可以做好的事情也做不好。因此，老农经验要听取，但绝不是不加分析地无条件地接受。而青年农民的情况正和上面说的那种老农相反。他们勇于接受新事物，对于新的条件看得很清楚。但是对于新的条件在实际生产中究竟能够发挥多大作用，又往往估计不准。在工作中，他们往往光凭干劲、热情办事，结果脱离了实际。因此，要把事办好，要把经验和干劲结合起来，就要充分发挥老农和青年农民以及中年农民各方面的优点。四川郫县红光公社第二耕作区党支部组织社员讨论合理密植，就是一个好例子。在讨论会上老农刘海洲说：“种庄稼要看天看地看工夫。去年每亩密植三万窝，收成很好，可是同样的地按十万窝栽法就减了产。”他认为今年仍旧应该保持三万窝的规格。一些青年农民也同意他的意见，说过密不好，但是认为应该看到今年肥料、除虫、技术等条件有了改善，还是可以比去年种得更密一些。讨论的结果，大家都同意把老经验和新技术结合起来，并且具体规划出每块田的合理密植规格。
    关于各项作物的种植密度，党中央曾明确指示过，领导机关不能硬性规定，必须由群众商量，作出决定。对这个原则我们决不能有所动摇。但是，这是不是说在农业技术方面，领导机关就根本不用过问了呢？不是的，还必须加强领导。经验证明，哪个地区领导的具体（当然不是生硬的简单化的领导，更不是主观主义地脱离群众的领导），农业增产幅度就大；哪个地区在这方面缺乏强有力的领导，那里的增产成绩就小。现在，有的同志对密植这样一项重大技术措施，甚至连一个有客观根据的提供群众参考的规定也不敢提了。这当然是不对的。为了加强领导，各地党委目前应该做这样一件事情，就是在同群众认真地商量之后，提出一个供群众参考的密植规划，然后让各个承包单位进行广泛的充分的讨论，再由他们自己作出决定，并采取各项有效措施、组织力量，贯彻执行。只有这样，才能使我们的晚稻和晚秋作物作到最大限度的合理密植，才能既避免去年部分地方由于过密而受到的损失，也不至重新回到以往过于稀植的老路上去。
