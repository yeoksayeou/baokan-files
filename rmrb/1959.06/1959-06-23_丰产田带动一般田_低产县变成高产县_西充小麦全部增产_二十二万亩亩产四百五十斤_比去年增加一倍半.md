Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 22nd: The people of Xichong County, Sichuan Province, with its thin and barren soil, overcame numerous difficulties and achieved the first summer harvest since communization. The entire county's 227,421 mu of wheat, after actual harvesting, threshing, drying, and weighing, achieved an average yield of 452.9 jin per mu, an increase of over 168% compared to last year. The 70 mu of high-yield wheat fields cultivated by the Xichong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party averaged 1,056 jin per mu. A 103-mu high-yield field in the Shuangfeng Commune averaged over 911 jin per mu. The Dongfeng Commune had 16,000 mu of wheat averaging 615 jin per mu.

Xichong is located in northern Sichuan, with undulating hills, more mountains than land, and more dry land than paddy fields. Moreover, about 70% of the land is thin soil, resulting in consistently low wheat yields. After last autumn, over 100,000 farmers in the county, under the leadership of the Xichong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, launched a massive "land emancipation" campaign, borrowing soil to thicken the soil layer. This increased the soil layer of 40,000 mu of land with a soil layer less than six inches thick to over one foot. Simultaneously, they transformed over 2,000 mountain peaks and made good soil and water conservation work on most mountain land. The county also rushed to produce over 5,000 rope-drawn plows, gaining time to ensure that all wheat was sown in deep-plowed land at the appropriate time. To solve the problem of drought when sunny and flooding when rainy, the county's land drainage system was reorganized. They also repaired over 10,000 reservoirs and, based on the location of ponds and reservoirs, planned water usage for wheat fields, basically resolving the worries of drought and flood. Once sowing was completed, the communes fully shifted to field management, proposing the slogan "Manage early, manage well, and guarantee every plot has first-class seedlings," seizing the opportunity to apply fertilizer and cultivate the soil, ensuring sufficient fertilizer and water, and freedom from pests and diseases. Throughout the entire management process, they also adopted a series of measures to prevent wheat lodging, such as "eating" less and "dining" more frequently, applying fertilizer based on seedling growth, and adding soil and inserting branches. Therefore, despite suffering seven major wind and rainstorms, all the county's wheat stood upright and strong, without suffering damage.

Political command and establishing model examples were the decisive reasons for the county's unprecedented wheat harvest. From wheat sowing to harvesting, the first secretaries of the county, district, and commune Party committees personally participated in production and leadership in high-yield plots, using them to promote general field production. Members of the County Committee were also stationed throughout the county, dividing responsibilities to manage five high-yield routes and three high-yield plots. Cadres at the district, township, commune, and team levels also strengthened leadership by managing designated areas while cultivating command fields. The county also organized over 400 specialized wheat production teams, who managed high-yield spots and high-yield land, implemented technical excellence and high-quality workmanship requirements, and played a significant role in promoting large-scale wheat harvest throughout the county.

The county's great wheat harvest greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses and further strengthened their determination to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." Currently, the masses throughout the county are summarizing wheat high-yield experience to guide the production of autumn-harvested crops.

### 丰产田带动一般田  低产县变成高产县  西充小麦全部增产  二十二万亩亩产四百五十斤  比去年增加一倍半

    丰产田带动一般田  低产县变成高产县
    西充小麦全部增产
    二十二万亩亩产四百五十斤  比去年增加一倍半
    新华社成都22日电　土薄地瘦的四川省西充县人民，战胜重重难关，夺得了公社化后第一个夏季大丰收。全县二十二万七千四百二十一市亩小麦，经实收实打，晒干扬净，过秤核实，平均每亩产量达到四百五十二点九斤，比去年增长168％强。中共西充县委种植的七十亩小麦丰产片，平均亩产一千零五十六斤，双凤公社一块一百零三亩的丰产片平均亩产九百一十一斤多。东风公社有一万六千亩小麦平均亩产六百一十五斤。
    西充地处川北，境内丘陵起伏，山多地少，旱地比水田多，而且70％左右的地都是薄土，小麦产量一向较低。去年秋后，全县十多万农民在中共西充县委的领导下，大闹土地翻身，借用客土加厚土层，使四万亩土层不到六寸厚的土地加厚到一尺以上，同时改造了二千多个山头，作好了大部分山地的水土保持工作。全县还赶制了五千多部绳索牵引犁，争取了时间，使所有的小麦都适时地种在深耕的土地上。为了解决天晴就旱一雨便涝的问题，又将全县土地排水系统加以整理，同时还修补了一万多个蓄水池，并根据塘库位置，规划了麦田用水，基本解决了旱涝之忧。当播种一结束，各公社就全力转入田间管理，提出了“管得早、管得好，保证块块一类苗”的口号，抓紧进行追肥、中耕，做到肥饱水足，无虫无病。在整个管理过程中，还采取了少“吃”多“餐”、看苗追肥和培土、插枝等一系列防止小麦倒伏的措施，因此，虽然前后遭受了七次大风雨的袭击，但全县小麦都直立健壮，没有受到损害。
    政治挂帅，树立标兵，这是全县取得小麦空前丰收的决定性原因。从小麦播种到收割，县、区、公社党委第一书记都在用以推动一般大田的丰产片中，亲自参加生产领导生产。县委委员也分驻全县各地，分工管理五条丰产路、三个丰产片。各区、乡、社、队干部也在种植指挥田的同时，分片包干，加强领导。全县还组织了四百多个小麦专业生产队，他们管理丰产点、高产地，贯彻了技术好和活路质量高的要求，对全县小麦大面积丰收起了很大的推动作用。
    全县小麦大丰收，大大鼓舞了广大群众的干劲，更加坚定了人们贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的决心。目前，全县群众正在总结小麦丰产经验，用以指导秋收作物的生产。
