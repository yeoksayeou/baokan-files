Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 10th: The rainy season in Guangdong Province came early this year, and all rivers entered the flood season earlier than in previous years. Recently, the East, West, and North Rivers, as well as the Han River and Moyang River, have successively experienced flood peaks. Especially since May, due to continuous heavy rainfall in some areas, relatively large floods have occurred. In order to ensure a bumper early rice harvest, people throughout the province are actively engaged in flood prevention efforts.

Some time ago, Leibei, Dianbai, Liangyang and other counties in the Zhanjiang Special District, before and after the arrival of heavy rain and floods, regarded flood prevention and rescue as the central task, mobilizing the masses to go all out. When the flood threat was serious, Zhanjiang Special District dispatched more than 400,000 flood prevention and rescue troops to reinforce dangerous sections of dikes and embankments and patrol and protect them. Thanks to the heroic struggle of the broad masses of cadres and people, the safety of the dikes was ensured, and more than 600,000 mu of the 700,000 mu of flooded land was rescued after taking measures such as drainage, leaf washing, and topdressing. When the flood situation was tense in Gaoyao County, located in the lower reaches of the West River, the county party secretary and all 28 commune party secretaries personally went to the dikes to direct the masses in combat, and completed all the dike reinforcement projects within a few days. The North River embankment protects Guangzhou City and more than one million mu of farmland in the Pearl River Delta and is the focus of flood control in the province. The entire annual repair project of the embankment and more than 60 kilometers of breakwater walls have been completed recently by tens of thousands of laborers from Qingyuan, Nanhai, and Hua County working day and night. Patrol and rescue teams are stationed in dangerous sections of the embankment, such as Shijiao and Lubao, and a large number of fir wood, grass bags, boats and other flood control and rescue equipment are prepared. More than 20 key flood control counties located in the lower reaches of the North River, Han River, and East River, and along the West River and Moyang River, have generally inspected, reinforced, and protected dikes and embankments.

Strengthening the flood control work of newly built water conservancy projects is of great significance for overcoming this year's floods. Therefore, all localities have generally inspected and repaired newly built water conservancy projects and strengthened patrol and maintenance. Those under construction are being rushed to complete in order to stay ahead of the floods. After conducting a general survey of newly built ponds and reservoirs in late May, some counties in the Shantou Special District rushed to repair 655 dangerous ponds and reservoirs within two days. Recently, the province's water conservancy construction army has increased from more than 400,000 in the early stage to more than 600,000. They are working day and night to build dams and are taking measures to improve the storage and discharge capacity of reservoirs, such as excavating temporary flood diversion channels and drainage ditches, and first rushing to build the upstream slopes of earth dams.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 10th: The mass flood prevention struggle in Henan Province has begun. Special districts, counties, and townships have established and improved flood prevention organizations, organized more than 2 million flood prevention personnel, prepared a large amount of flood prevention materials, installed water condition telecommunications equipment to ensure that more than 250 flood reporting stations can report flood conditions normally, and rushed to complete 30 million cubic meters of earth and stone for repair projects and unfinished projects, creating conditions for overcoming floods. Henan Province's flood prevention preparations began in full swing in mid-May. All localities, with production teams as units, organized various flood prevention and rescue teams. After the rainfall on June 2, most areas held telephone conferences, put forward requirements, with secretaries taking the lead, cadres dividing the work, organizing labor to rush to repair projects, rushing to transport materials to the construction site, and actively engaging in the flood prevention and water storage struggle.

All localities have conducted a comprehensive inspection of dangerous sections of river channels and unfinished projects, prioritized them according to urgency, and taken active measures to rush repairs.

In accordance with the principles of relying on the masses, equal value exchange, using local materials, self-reliance, and returning equipment to the team, all localities have prepared a large amount of flood prevention materials.

    广东河南向洪水展开斗争
    据新华社广州10日电　今年广东地区雨季来得早，各江河都比往年提早进入汛期。最近东、西、北江和韩江、漠阳江都相继出现洪峰，特别是自5月份以来，局部地区因连续暴雨，发生了较大的洪水。为了确保早稻丰收，全省各地人民积极地展开了防洪斗争。
    前些日子，湛江专区的雷北、电白、两阳等县，在暴雨洪水到来前后，都把防洪抢险当做中心任务，动员群众全力以赴。洪水威胁严重时，湛江专区出动了四十多万防洪抢险大军，突击加固堤围险段和上堤巡逻防护，在广大干部和群众的英勇搏斗下，保证了堤围的安全，受浸的七十万亩田地经采取排涝、洗叶和追肥等措施后，已抢救出来六十多万亩。处于西江下游的高要县在汛情紧张时，县委书记和全县二十八个公社党委书记都亲自上堤，指挥群众作战，几天内就完成了全部需要加固的堤围工程。北江大堤保卫着广州市和珠江三角洲一百多万亩农田，是全省防汛的重点。大堤的全部岁修工程和六十多公里长的防浪石墙，经清远、南海和花县数万民工的日夜奋战，已在最近完工。在大堤的石角、芦包等险段，都驻扎有巡逻抢险队，并且准备了大批的杉木、草包、船只等防洪抢险器材。位于北江、韩江、东江下游和西江、漠阳江沿岸的二十多个防汛重点县，普遍对堤围进行了检查、加固和防护工作。
    加强新建水利工程的防洪工作，对战胜今年的洪水具有很大意义，因此各地对新建成的水利工程普遍进行检修，加强了巡逻维护。对正在施工的则进行抢工，以便跑在洪水的前面。汕头专区部分县在
  5月下旬对新建塘库进行普查后，两天内就抢修了有危险的塘库六百五十五宗。最近，全省的水利建设大军由前期的四十多万增加到六十多万，他们正在日夜不停地抢筑大坝，并且采取开挖临时溢洪道、排水渠和首先抢筑土坝迎水坡等办法，提高水库的蓄泄能力。
    据新华社郑州10日电　河南省群众性的防汛斗争已经开始。各专区、县、乡都已经建立与健全防汛机构，共组织了二百多万人的防汛队伍，准备了大量的防汛器材，安装了水情电汛联络设备，保证二百五十多个报汛站能够正常报汛，突击完成了修复工程和未完工程的尾工土石方三千万公方，为战胜洪水创造了条件。河南省的防汛准备工作，从5月中旬就全面开始。各地以生产队为单位，组织了各种防汛抢险队伍。6月2日降雨后，多数地区又召开电话会议，提出要求，由书记挂帅，干部分工，组织劳力抢修工程，往工地赶运物料，积极地投入了防汛蓄水斗争。
    各地对河道险工和未完工程尾工等进行了全面检查，已分别缓急，采取积极措施，突击整修。
    各地根据依靠群众，等价交换，就地取材，自力更生，器材归队的原则，已经准备了大批防汛物资。
