Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, June 29th: A mass rally of unprecedented scale was held in Nicosia yesterday by 120,000 Cypriots, demanding the revocation of the "decree" banning the activities of the Progressive Party of the Working People. This "decree," which outlawed the party that truly represents the interests of the Cypriot people, was originally promulgated by the British colonial authorities in 1955.

The blazing sun could not deter the people's enthusiasm, which was even hotter than the sun. They came to the rally from all over Cyprus in an endless stream, men holding Greek flags, women pushing baby carriages, as well as young men and women and children.

Ezekias Papaioannou, General Secretary of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus, spoke at the meeting, pointing out that continuing to implement the above-mentioned order of the British colonialists to persecute the Progressive Party of the Working People was a provocation to the people and out of step with the times. He was warmly cheered by the masses attending the meeting.

Kostas Partassides, the mayor of Limassol, also spoke at the meeting. He said, "Our freedom and independence have been adulterated, because Britain still retains bases after the declaration of the Republic (of Cyprus), and foreign troops are still stationed (on the island)." His words were warmly echoed by the masses.

He condemned the Zurich agreement on the Cyprus issue reached between Greece and Turkey under pressure from the United States, pointing out that this agreement violated the national aspirations of the Cypriot people. He said that the Cypriot people had always fought against "partition," but the Zurich agreement actually imposed "partition" on them.

The conference passed a resolution condemning the right-wing forces for monopolizing political life in Cyprus.

    要求撤销禁止劳动人民进步党活动的“法令”
    塞浦路斯十二万人集会
    新华社29日讯　尼科西亚消息：十二万塞浦路斯人民昨天在尼科西亚举行了规模空前的群众大会，要求撤消禁止劳动人民进步党活动的“法令”。关于取缔真正代表塞浦路斯人民利益的这个党的这个“法令”，原来是英国殖民当局在1955年颁布的。
    炎炎烈日阻挡不了人们比烈日还炽热的热情，他们从塞浦路斯各地络绎不绝地来到大会会场，有举着希腊国旗的男人，有推着婴儿车的妇女，还有男女青年和儿童。
    塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党总书记埃泽基阿斯·巴巴约安努在会上讲了话，指出继续执行英国殖民者迫害劳动人民进步党的上述命令是对人民的挑衅，并且是不合时宜的。参加大会的群众对他热烈地欢呼。
    利马索尔市的市长科斯塔斯·帕尔塔西迪斯也在会上讲了话。他说：“由于宣布（塞浦路斯）成立共和国之后英国仍然保有基地，而且（岛上）仍然驻有外国军队，我们的自由和独立已经变质。”他的话得到了群众的热烈响应。
    他谴责在美国压力下希腊和土耳其就塞浦路斯问题达成的苏黎世协议，指出这个协议违反了塞浦路斯人民的民族愿望。他说，塞浦路斯人民过去一直为反对“分治”而奋斗，而苏黎世协议实际上却把“分治”强加于他们。
    大会通过了一项决议，谴责右翼力量垄断塞浦路斯的政治生活。
