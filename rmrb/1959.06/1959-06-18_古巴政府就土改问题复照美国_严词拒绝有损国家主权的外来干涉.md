Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 16th: Foreign Minister Raúl Roa replied to the U.S. State Department on the 15th regarding Cuba's land reform issue, stating that the Cuban government refuses to accept any instructions or suggestions that would damage national sovereignty and dignity, and will take decisions that best suit the vital interests of the Cuban people.

In his reply, Raúl Roa pointed out that the Cuban government has the right to exercise national sovereignty and take the measures it deems most appropriate to promote and guarantee the economic development, social progress, and democratic stability of the Cuban people. This is a right that cannot be deprived from the Cuban government.

Regarding the issue of demanding "immediate and full compensation to American investors affected by the land reform," the reply stated that the Cuban government has exercised the constitutional rights granted by the noble will of the Cuban people, who heroically resisted oppressors, and has adopted compensation methods it believes are in line with the highest interests of the nation. The reply announced that the extremely unbalanced state of payment settlements between the United States and Cuba is unfavorable to Cuba and is one of the reasons for the chaotic state of the Cuban economy. Cuba's deficit in this regard has been approximately ten billion U.S. dollars in the last decade.

The U.S. government's note demanding that Cuba consider the consequences of land reform was formally presented to Cuba on the 11th. This rude note interfering in Cuba's internal affairs has aroused strong protests among workers, peasants, and students throughout Cuba. Farmers in Bayamo, Oriente Province, recently passed a resolution at a congress held in Bayamo City, protesting the U.S. note interfering in Cuba's internal affairs. The resolution considered the U.S. note to be a violation of Cuban sovereignty. The congress decided that farmers should raise their vigilance and mobilize to oppose all conspiracies against land reform and any attempts to undermine national independence and sovereignty.

    古巴政府就土改问题复照美国
    严词拒绝有损国家主权的外来干涉
    新华社哈瓦那16日电　外交部 部长劳尔·罗亚15日就古巴的土地改革问题复照美国国务院，表示古巴政府拒绝接受任何有损国家主权和尊严的指示或建议，而将采取最符合古巴人民切身利益的决定。
    劳尔·罗亚在复照中指出，古巴政府有权行使国家的主权，采取自己认为最恰当的措施来促进并保证古巴人民的经济发展、社会进步和民主稳定，这是古巴政府不容剥夺的权利。
    复照谈到关于要求“立刻给那些受到土地改革影响的美国投资家们充分的赔偿”问题时说，古巴政府运用了英勇地反对压迫者的古巴人民的崇高意志所授予的宪法权利，采取了它认为符合国家最高利益的赔偿办法。复照宣布说，美国和古巴之间的支付结算极不平衡的状况是对古巴不利的，是造成古巴经济情况混乱的原因之一，在最近十年当中，古巴在这方面的逆差约为十亿美元。
    美国政府要求古巴考虑土地改革将引起的后果的照会是在11日正式向古巴提出的。这个蛮横干涉古巴内政的照会在古巴全国各地的工人、农民和学生中引起了强烈的抗议浪潮。奥连特省巴亚莫的农民最近在巴亚莫城举行的代表大会上通过决议，抗议美国干涉古巴内政的照会。决议认为，美国的照会是对古巴主权的损害。大会决定要农民提高警惕和动员起来，反对种种反对土地改革的阴谋活动，反对任何损害国家独立和主权的企图。
