From Sovereignty and Suzerainty to China's Relationship with Tibet
Yu Fan

What is Sovereignty? What is Suzerainty?

Since the Tibetan rebellion, the fallacy of "China only has suzerainty over Tibet and not sovereignty" has reappeared among British imperialists and some foreigners. Therefore, it is necessary to explain the difference between sovereignty and suzerainty.

Simply put, national sovereignty is the supreme power of a country within its own territory to independently decide its internal and external affairs according to its own will.

According to the principle of sovereignty, a country has the right to determine its own national form, political system, and socio-economic system according to its own will, and no other country is allowed to interfere. What should be done in internal affairs and what should be reformed are matters for the country concerned, and no other country is allowed to intervene. Therefore, the principle of sovereignty leads to another important principle, called the principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs.

The principle of sovereignty is one of the basic principles of modern recognized international law, and the principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs derived from the principle of sovereignty is also one of the basic principles of modern recognized international law. As a sovereign and independent country, it must maintain its own sovereignty and also demand that its sovereignty be respected by other countries. This is the most basic principle and needs no further explanation.

What is suzerainty? Suzerainty is a special form of rule by large countries over small countries during the feudal period. The country that possesses suzerainty is called the suzerain state, and the country that is subject to the suzerain state is called the vassal state. The relationship of dependence of such a vassal state on the suzerain state is called vassalage. Under this relationship, the foreign affairs of the vassal state are usually managed by the suzerain state. The vassal state has a certain degree of autonomy or self-government internally, but the vassal state must fulfill certain obligations to the suzerain state, especially paying tribute. This unequal relationship between the suzerain state and the vassal state fully demonstrates a characteristic of international relations during the feudal period. Therefore, suzerainty can also be called feudal rule.

Before the independence of India and Pakistan, there were about five hundred vassal states of varying sizes in India. In order to facilitate divide and rule, the British preserved these vassal states and ruled them through the Governor-General of India appointed by the British King. The British King was both "King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Overseas Territories" and "Emperor of India," placing himself in the position of suzerain. It is evident that British imperialism used the feudal form of suzerainty to cover up its colonialist expansionist policies and the cruelty of its colonial rule. This feudal relationship of large countries dominating small countries was utilized by colonialists as one of the forms of colonial rule, and suzerainty became a tool for imperialism to cover up its aggression and expansion.

The suzerain relationship established by the Ottoman Empire and Egypt in history had another meaning.

Egypt was originally a province of the Ottoman Empire. In the nineteenth century, the struggle between Britain and France for leadership in Egypt was fierce. The Sultan of Turkey and the Pasha of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, engaged in civil war. France supported Egypt, and Britain supported Turkey. As a result, Turkey was defeated by Egypt. Turkey then sought help from Britain. Britain, together with Austria, Prussia, Tsarist Russia, and Turkey, concluded the so-called "Convention for the Pacification of the Near East" in London on July 15, 1840. In the annex to this convention, the terms of the agreement between the Turkish Sultan and Muhammad Ali were stipulated:

(1) The Sultan granted Muhammad Ali the hereditary rule of Egypt and the territory of southern Syria for his lifetime rule.

(2) Muhammad Ali should pay a certain amount of tribute to the Sultan each year.

(3) All treaties and laws of the Ottoman Empire should still apply to Egypt. Muhammad Ali could collect taxes in the name of the Sultan.

(4) The naval and land forces commanded by Muhammad Ali should be part of the Ottoman Empire's army.

In this way, Britain, for its own convenience in further invading Egypt, used the form of a treaty to guarantee Turkey's status as the suzerain state over Egypt, effectively denying Turkey's sovereignty over Egypt, until December 18, 1914, when Britain, citing Turkey's participation in World War I on the side of Germany, unilaterally declared the termination of Turkey's suzerainty over Egypt and announced the establishment of its protectorate over Egypt. In fact, Britain had long controlled Egypt since 1840, and Turkey only had an empty and nominal title of suzerain over Egypt. This is an example of imperialism recognizing another country's suzerainty over a part of its territory as a manipulative means to achieve its own conspiracy to plunder that part of the territory.

China's Rule over Tibet is a Form of Complete Sovereignty

But what is the relationship between China and Tibet?

History tells us that as early as the mid-thirteenth century, the Yuan Dynasty unified Tibet and incorporated it into the territory of China. By the Qing Dynasty, the relationship between Tibet and the central government became even closer. The Qing Dynasty's rule over Tibet was not in the form of suzerainty, but in the form of complete sovereignty. Not only was the title of "Dalai Lama" stipulated from the time of Emperor Shunzhi, but even the political system and laws and regulations of the Tibetan local government were prescribed by the Qing Dynasty. In 1728, the Qing government began sending two resident ministers to Tibet to jointly manage political affairs with the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. The "Twenty-Nine Articles of the Imperial Ordinance," promulgated in 1793 (the 58th year of the Qianlong reign), covered all aspects of Tibetan local administration, such as: the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and other Hutuktu; the relationship and powers between the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and the resident ministers; the organizational regulations and personnel rules of the Tibetan local government (Kasha); Tibetan tax, finance, and currency regulations; judicial organization and litigation procedures; the management of religious temples; the management of foreigners; foreign trade and border inspection systems, etc. The resident minister had great power, and even the official documents from the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama to the resident minister were called "official reports." This form of rule over Tibet was absolutely not a form of suzerainty, but a form of sovereignty.

This was acknowledged even by British imperialists themselves after British imperialism invaded Tibet. Colonel Younghusband (later Sir Francis Younghusband), who led the British army to invade Tibet in 1904 (the illegal so-called "Anglo-Tibetan Treaty" was signed by him on behalf of Britain with the Tibetan local government in Lhasa on September 7, 1904), pointed out in his book "India and Tibet" that three days after he signed the "Anglo-Tibetan Treaty," he personally saw a notice posted by the resident minister in Lhasa, which concluded:

"The Dalai Lama should be more responsible for matters of the Yellow Sect faith and monks, and less for consulting on public affairs, while the resident minister should lead Tibetan officials to preside over all Tibetan affairs, and only report to the emperor when important matters arise." (Translated from English sources)

Since the authority of the resident minister was so prominent, in the autumn of 1908, the 13th Dalai Lama requested Empress Dowager Cixi in Beijing to directly report matters to the emperor without going through the resident minister, but Cixi refused. Until the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the official system of resident minister in Tibet was never abolished. This shows that China's relationship with Tibet has always been a sovereign relationship, not a suzerain relationship, and that Tibet has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory.

The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty, changed the name of the country to the "Republic of China," and changed the national flag to the five-colored flag, with the five colors of red, yellow, blue, white, and black symbolizing the "Five Races United" of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan. This also shows that after the Xinhai Revolution, Tibet remained a part of Chinese territory, and Tibet was by no means a vassal state.

Britain's Conspiracy to Create "Chinese Suzerainty over Tibet" Ultimately Failed

In fact, the imperialists knew very well that Tibet was an inseparable part of Chinese territory. When Britain planned to invade Tibet, the British government seriously considered this point. How to undermine China's sovereignty over Tibet in order to achieve its own goals of invading Tibet was a major issue that British imperialism meticulously considered.

Lord Curzon of Kedleston advocated active aggression against Tibet, calling himself a vanguard of the "Forward Policy" of invading Tibet. In January 1903, while he was Governor-General of India, he offered a strategy to the British Secretary of State for India in London, saying in a report to the Secretary of State for India:

"Chinese suzerainty over Tibet, retained as a constitutional fiction—a political make-believe, is convenient to both sides." (Both sides refer to India and Tibet—Author's note)

But the instructions of the Secretary of State for India, Hamilton, expressed caution, saying:

"His Majesty's Government considers that this is not only a matter between India and Tibet, but the position of China in relation to the powers has undergone such changes in recent years that it is necessary to consider these changes when deciding on actions involving a province of China that must still be regarded as such."

On January 14, 1904, the British Foreign Secretary's instructions to the British Ambassador to Russia also pointed out "the advantages and necessity of maintaining the political status quo in a province of the Chinese Empire (referring to Tibet—Author's note)."

It can be seen from this that the British imperialists clearly knew that the relationship between China and Tibet was a relationship between the central government and the local government, acknowledging that Tibet was "a province of the Chinese Empire," that Tibet was an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and that China's relationship with Tibet was clearly a sovereign relationship, not a suzerain relationship. Despite their ambitious plans to invade Tibet, they could not but have some concerns given the complex international contradictions at the time. However, after two or three years of hesitation, they finally played the card of Curzon's strategy—manipulating the conspiracy to recognize China's suzerainty over Tibet.

In fact, Britain's manipulative tactics of suzerainty were not a new creation by Curzon. As mentioned earlier in this article, Britain had used the recognition of Turkey's suzerainty over Egypt through the London Convention of July 15, 1840, to obtain its own convenience in further invading Egypt. After 1904, Britain also attempted to imitate this method in invading Tibet, repeatedly fabricating Curzon's so-called "political make-believe"—"recognizing China's suzerainty over Tibet"—in an attempt to gradually separate Tibet from the motherland.

In the history of British aggression against Tibet, from 1904 to 1914, Britain repeatedly attempted to impose the name of "Chinese suzerainty over Tibet" through treaties in order to obliterate China's true sovereignty over Tibet, but none of these attempts were agreed to by China.

The first time was on April 27, 1906, during the negotiations in Beijing between Tang Shaoyi, Right Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Qing government, and Sir Ernest Satow, the British Minister to China, on the "Six Articles of the Supplementary Sino-British Convention Regarding Tibet and India." As mentioned above, British Colonel Younghusband led the British army to invade Tibet and, on September 7, 1904 (the 28th day of the seventh month of the 30th year of the Guangxu reign), signed the illegal "Anglo-Tibetan Treaty" with the Tibetan local government, which had absolutely no diplomatic power, in Lhasa, in the absence of the resident minister, thereby gaining a privileged position in Tibet. The Qing government protested to the British government about this, and then China and Britain reopened negotiations to conclude another treaty regarding Tibet. Britain demanded that the new treaty stipulate:

"The British government acknowledges China as the suzerain power of Tibet." At that time, the Chinese representative opposed the word "suzerain power." The details of the debate and negotiations are detailed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' memorial to the emperor requesting instructions on how to handle the negotiations on the Tibetan treaty between China and Britain.

The so-called "British government acknowledges China as the suzerain power of Tibet," the word "suzerain power" refers to the suzerain state. It can be seen from this that Britain did propose in this draft treaty that Britain recognize China as the suzerain state of Tibet, attempting to impose the virtual suzerainty on China's relationship with Tibet. Even if the Qing government was昏愦 无能 [muddle-headed and incompetent], it would not dare to risk the world's condemnation and accept such a humiliating trap. Therefore, although the Six Articles of the Supplementary Sino-British Convention Regarding Tibet and India of 1906 were extorted many privileges by Britain, there was no provision for the so-called "Chinese suzerainty over Tibet."

The second time was on August 31, 1907, when Britain and Russia explicitly put forward "Chinese suzerainty over Tibet" in the agreement on Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet signed in St. Petersburg. At that time, the contradictions between European imperialists were very intense. In order to deal with a common enemy—Germany—Britain and Russia had to reach an agreement on the division of their spheres of influence in Asia in order to temporarily ease the contradictions between the two countries. Section III of the agreement, namely the section on Tibet, Article 2 stipulates as follows:

"In accordance with the principle of recognizing Chinese suzerainty over Tibet, the British and Russian governments agree not to engage in direct negotiations with Tibet except through the Chinese government...."

However, this agreement was signed by Britain and Russia and was only valid between Britain and Russia. Since China was not a contracting party, according to the principle of treaty law that "an agreement between two contracting parties cannot bind a third country," this agreement naturally could not bind China. How could the virtual "suzerainty" be imposed on China's relationship with Tibet in an agreement without China's knowledge!

The third time was in the infamous so-called "Simla Convention" (draft) of July 3, 1914. After the Xinhai Revolution, pro-British elements in the upper echelons of Tibet seized the opportunity to launch a rebellion. The Yuan Shikai government was advancing into Tibet, but the British Minister to China, Sir John Jordan, strongly interfered, resulting in the so-called "Sino-British-Tibetan Tripartite Conference" being held in Simla, India. The conference began on October 13, 1913.

This so-called "Simla Convention" was an absurd document. The so-called Tibetan representative, Lönchen Shathra, brazenly put forward the absurd demand for "Tibetan independence" at the meeting, while the British representative, McMahon, appeared on the surface as a mediator between the Chinese government and Tibet, proposing a so-called mediation draft, consisting of eleven articles, Article 2 of which stipulates as follows:

"The governments of Great Britain and China recognizing Tibet as being under the suzerainty of China, and recognizing the autonomy of Outer Tibet, and in order to respect the complete autonomy of the country, all internal affairs of Outer Tibet (including the election of the Dalai Lama) shall be administered by the Lhasa government, and the governments of Great Britain and China shall not interfere therein. The Chinese government shall not convert Tibet into a province, and the British government shall not annex any part of Tibet."

It is worth noting that this clause not only describes China as the suzerain state of Tibet, but also describes Tibet as a country, such as "a country under the suzerainty of China," "the country," etc. However, the British representative, McMahon, was extremely cunning at the conference. At the meeting on April 27, 1914, he hypocritically said to the Chinese representative:

"Tibet has already separated from the Republic of China. By concluding this treaty, China can restore suzerainty over Tibet, and there can be a shield outside the Chinese border provinces."

After the discussion of the draft, the Chinese representative, Chen Yifan, refused to sign the treaty on the order of the then Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later, the Chinese government formally denied the treaty to the British government.

It can be seen from this that Britain had attempted three times to impose the name of "Chinese suzerainty over Tibet" on China through treaties in an attempt to obliterate China's complete sovereignty over Tibet by recognizing its fabricated so-called Chinese suzerainty over Tibet. But although Britain repeatedly proposed it, neither the Qing government nor the Beiyang government accepted it. This sinister and vicious conspiracy to manipulate suzerainty, initiated by Curzon, ultimately failed.

On April 29, 1954, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government

    从主权和宗主权说到中国对西藏地方的关系
    于蕃
    什么是主权？什么是宗主权
    自从西藏叛乱事件发生后，英帝国主义分子和某些外国人关于“中国对西藏只有宗主权而没有主权”的谬论又出现了。因之，有必要对主权和宗主权的区别加以说明。
    简单地说，国家主权是一个国家在它自己的领土范围内，按照自己的意志，独立地决定它的对内和对外事务的最高权力。
    根据主权原则，国家有权按照自己的意志确定自己的国家形式、政治制度和社会经济制度，绝不允许别国干涉。内政上何者应予进行，何者应予改革，都是有关国家自己的事，绝不允许别国插手。因此从主权原则出发，引伸出另一个重要原则，这叫做不干涉他国内政的原则。
    主权原则是现代公认的国际法基本原则之一，从主权原则引伸出来的不干涉他国内政的原则也是现代公认的国际法基本原则之一。作为一个主权独立的国家，必须维持自己的主权，同时也要求自己的主权受到别国的尊重。这是最基本的道理，无须多说的。
    宗主权是什么？宗主权是封建时期大国支配小国的一种特殊统治形式。拥有宗主权的国家称宗主国，而受宗主国支配的国家称附庸国。这种附庸国对宗主国的依赖关系称为附庸关系。在这种关系下，通常附庸国的对外事务，都由宗主国来代管。附庸国对内拥有一定程度的自主权，或称自治，但附庸国须对宗主国尽一定的义务，特别是纳贡。这种宗主国和附庸国间的不平等关系充分表现了封建时期国际关系的一个特点，因此，宗主权也可称为封建的统治权。
    在印度和巴基斯坦独立以前，印度就有大小不等的附庸国约五百个，英国为便于分而治之，把这些附庸国都保存下来，并由英王派印度总督来统治。英王既是“大不列颠和北爱尔兰联合王国以及海外领土国王”又兼为“印度皇帝”，自居宗主的地位。人们就可以明显地看出英帝国主义利用封建的宗主权形式，来掩盖它的殖民主义扩张政策和殖民主义的残酷统治。这种封建时期大国驾驭小国的统治关系，就被殖民主义者利用为殖民统治的形式之一，宗主权就此成为帝国主义掩护它进行侵略和扩张的一种工具。
    历史上奥托曼帝国和埃及所建立的宗主关系具有另一种意义。
    埃及原为奥托曼帝国的一省，十九世纪英法争夺埃及的领导权很激烈，土耳其的苏丹和埃及的帕夏穆罕默德·阿里发生内战，法国支持埃及，英国支持土耳其，结果土耳其反被埃及击败，于是土耳其求助于英国，英国联合了奥地利、普鲁士、帝俄和土耳其于1840年7月15日在伦敦缔结了所谓“关于绥靖近东的公约”，在这个公约的附件里，规定了土耳其苏丹和穆罕默德·阿里的协议条件：
    （1）苏丹给予穆罕默德·阿里以埃及为其世袭领地，以叙利亚南部领土为其终身领地，归其统治。
    （2）穆罕默德·阿里应每年向苏丹纳贡若干。
    （3）奥托曼帝国的一切条约和法律仍适用于埃及。穆罕默德·阿里可以苏丹名义征取捐税。
    （4）穆罕默德·阿里统率的海陆军队应作为奥托曼帝国军队的一部分。
    就是这样，英国为了自己进一步侵略埃及的便利，通过条约的形式来保证土耳其对埃及的宗主国地位，实际上否定了土耳其对埃及的主权，一直到1914年12月18日，英国借口土耳其参加欧战中德国一方，就以单方面宣言终止了土耳其对埃及的宗主权并宣布其对埃及成立保护关系。其实自1840年以后，英国早就控制了埃及，而土耳其仅对埃及拥有空洞的有名无实的宗主国名义罢了。这是帝国主义承认别国对其某一部分领土的宗主权，作为一种玩弄的手段来达到它自己掠夺这一部分领土的阴谋。
    中国统治西藏的形式是完全主权的形式
    可是中国同西藏的关系又是怎样的呢？
    历史告诉我们，远在十三世纪中叶，元朝就统一了西藏地方，把西藏地方归入中国的版图。到了清朝，西藏和中央的关系更加密切了。清朝统治西藏的形式不是宗主权的形式，而是完全主权的形式。不但“达赖喇嘛”的封号是从顺治皇帝就开始规定下来，连西藏地方政府的政治制度和法律规章也是清朝规定的。1728年，清政府就开始派驻藏大臣正副二人，与达赖、班禅共同管理政务。1793年 （清乾隆58年）所颁行的“钦定章程二十九条”，内容涉及西藏地方行政的各方面，例如：达赖、班禅和其他呼图克图的灵童转世问题，达赖、班禅和驻藏大臣间的相互关系和职权问题，西藏地方政府（噶厦）组织条例和人事章程，西藏税收、财政和货币条例，司法组织和诉讼程序，宗教寺庙的管理，外侨管理，对外贸易和边界检查制度等。驻藏大臣的权限很大，连达赖和班禅给驻藏大臣的公文也称公禀。这种对西藏的统治形式绝对不是宗主权的形式，而是主权的形式。
    这一点一直到英帝国主义进行侵略西藏以后，连英帝国主义分子自己也不得不予以承认。1904年率领英军入侵西藏的荣赫鹏上校（以后称弗朗西斯·荣赫鹏爵士，1904年9月7日非法的所谓“英藏条约”就是他代表英国在拉萨强迫西藏地方政府签订的），在他所著“印度和西藏”一书中指出在他签订“英藏条约”后三天，他还在拉萨街上亲眼看见驻藏大臣所贴的布告，布告的结束语说：
    “达赖喇嘛应多负责关于黄教信仰和僧侣事宜，而少顾问公事，至驻藏大臣则应率同西藏官员主持一切西藏事务，遇有要事才转奏皇帝。”（根据英文的资料译出）
    驻藏大臣的权威既然这样煊赫，于是1908年秋，十三世达赖在北京请求慈禧太后，希望遇事直接上奏皇帝，而不必通过驻藏大臣，但慈禧不准。一直到清朝复灭，驻藏大臣的官制没有被废弃过。这就说明中国对西藏的关系一向是主权关系，而不是什么宗主权关系，西藏一向是中国领土不可分割的一部分。
    辛亥革命推翻清朝，改国号为“中华民国”，改国旗为五色国旗，以红黄蓝白黑五色象征着汉、满、蒙、回、藏的“五族共和”。这也就说明辛亥革命后西藏地方依然为中国领土的一部分，西藏决不是什么附庸国。
    英国阴谋制造“中国对西藏的宗主权”始终未逞
    其实，西藏地方为中国领土不可分割的一部分，帝国主义者也知道得很清楚。英国蓄谋侵略西藏的时候，英国政府也曾郑重考虑到这一点。怎样来破坏中国对西藏的主权以期达到自己侵略西藏的目的，这是英帝国主义处心积虑的主要问题。
    英国的寇松勋爵主张积极侵略西藏，号称侵略西藏“前进政策”的急先锋。1903年1月当他在印度总督任内，他向伦敦英国主管印度事务大臣献了一条计策，他在给印度事务大臣的报告中说：
    “中国对西藏的宗主权，作为一种宪法上的虚拟——政治的假象而保留下来，对双方都感到方便。”（双方指印度和西藏——本文作者注）
    但是印度事务大臣汉密尔顿的训令却表示要郑重，训令说：
    “陛下政府认为这不仅是有关印度和西藏间的问题，中国在同列强关系中的地位近年来起了这样的变化，以致在决定行动涉及至今还须视为中国的一省的问题时，有必要考虑这些变动的情况。”
    1904年1月14日，英国外交大臣致英国驻俄大使的训令中，也指出“在中华帝国的一省（指西藏——本文作者注）中维持政治现状的好处和必要性”。
    由此可见，英帝国主义者明明知道中国和西藏地方的关系是中央和地方的关系，承认西藏是“中华帝国的一省”，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，中国对西藏地方的关系明明是主权关系，而不是什么宗主权关系，尽管侵略西藏的野心勃勃，鉴于当时国际间错综复杂的矛盾，还不能不有所顾虑，但经过二三年的犹豫以后，终于把寇松的计策——玩弄承认中国对西藏的宗主权的阴谋——这张牌打出来了。
    其实，英国玩弄宗主权的阴谋手段并不是什么寇松的新创造，正如本文前面所说，英国通过1840年7月15日的伦敦公约，曾利用承认土耳其对埃及的宗主权，而取得英国自己进一步侵略埃及的便利。1904年以后，英国侵略西藏，也妄想如法炮制，通过缔结条约的手段，好几次虚拟寇松所谓“政治的假象”——“承认中国对西藏的宗主权”，企图逐步把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去。
    在英国侵略西藏的历史中，从1904到1914年的十年中，英国几次企图通过条约的形式，虚拟“中国对西藏的宗主权”，以期抹煞中国对西藏的真正主权，但是都没有得到中国的同意。
    第一次是在1906年4月27日清政府外务部右侍郎唐绍仪和英国驻华公使萨道义在北京签订“中英续订藏印条约六款”的会商中提出的。上面曾经提到英国上校荣赫鹏率英军入侵西藏，擅于1904年9月7日（即光绪30年7月28日）在拉萨在驻藏大臣拒绝参加的情况下，同绝对没有外交权的西藏地方政府签订了非法的“英藏条约”，从而在西藏占得了特权地位。清政府为此向英政府提出抗议，随后中英间重开谈判另订藏约，而英国要求在新约中规定，
  “英国国家允认中国为西藏之上国”一款。当时中国代表反对“上国”二字，争辩交涉的经过，详述于当时外务部关于中英两国商议藏约请旨办理的奏折。
    所谓“英国国家允认中国为西藏之上国”一款，其“上国”二字就是宗主国。由此可见，英国确在这个条约草案中提出英国承认中国为西藏的宗主国，企图把虚拟的宗主权强加在中国对西藏地方的关系上。纵使清政府昏愦无能，也不敢冒天下之大不韪，来接受这样丧权辱国的圈套。因此1906年中英续订藏印条约六款虽被英国勒索去许多特权，却没有所谓“中国对西藏的宗主权”的规定。
    第二次是在1907年8月31日英俄在圣彼得堡签订的关于波斯、阿富汗和西藏的协定中把“中国对西藏的宗主权”明白提出来了。当时欧洲帝国主义之间矛盾很激烈，英俄为了对付共同的敌人——德国，不得不在划分两国在亚洲的势力范围问题上达成协议，以便暂时缓和英俄两国之间的矛盾。该协定第三部，即关于西藏部分，其第二条规定如下：
      “按照所认可的中国对西藏宗主权的原则，英俄两国约定除通过中国政府外，不与西藏直接交涉。……”
    但是这个协定是英俄两国签订的，只能在英俄之间有效。中国既然不是缔约国，根据“缔约双方间的协定不能拘束第三国”的条约法原则，这个协定当然不能拘束中国，怎能硬把虚拟的“宗主权”在中国不知情的协定中强加于中国对西藏地方的关系呢！
    第三次是在1914年7月3日臭名远扬的所谓“中英藏西姆拉条约”（草案）中提出的。辛亥革命后，西藏上层亲英分子乘机发动叛乱，袁世凯政府正向西藏进军，而英国驻华公使朱尔典竟然强硬干涉，于是有所谓“中英藏三方会议”在印度的西姆拉召开。会议是从1913年10月13日开始举行的。
    这个所谓“西姆拉条约”是荒唐透顶的文件。所谓西藏代表伦兴夏托拉在会议上悍然提出“西藏独立”的荒谬要求，而英国代表麦克马洪表面上以中国政府与西藏之间的仲裁者的姿态出现，提出所谓调停草案，全文十一条，其第二条规定如下：
      “中英两国同认西藏为属于中国宗主权之国，并认外藏有自治权，今为尊重该国自治之完全，所有外藏内政（选举达赖喇嘛事在内）应由拉萨政府管理，中英两国政府均不加以干涉。中国政府不改西藏为行省，英国政府不兼并西藏境内任何部分。”
    值得注意的是，这个条款不仅把中国说成是西藏的宗主国，还把西藏说成是一个国家，例如“属于中国宗主权之国”，“该国”等。然而英国代表麦克马洪在会议席上狡诘异常，在1914年4月27日的会议席上还向中国代表假惺惺地说：
    “西藏业已脱离中华民国，今订此约，中国可复有宗主权于西藏，而中国边省之外亦可有一屏蔽。”
    中国代表陈贻范在草案讨论结束以后，奉当时外交部电令拒绝签约。以后中国政府并正式向英政府否认该约。
    由此可见，英国曾经先后三次企图把“中国对西藏宗主权”的名义，通过条约的形式，强加在中国身上，企图以承认它所捏造的所谓中国对西藏的宗主权，来抹煞中国对西藏地方的完全主权。但是英国虽然一再提出，不论是清政府还是北洋政府，都没有接受。这一由寇松倡导的玩弄宗主权的阴险毒辣的阴谋，始终未能得逞。
    1954年4月29日中华人民共和国中央人民政府和印度共和国政府在北京签订了关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定，协定的序言规定如下：
    “中华人民共和国中央人民政府和印度共和国政府为了促进中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商贸易和文化交流并便利两国人民互相朝圣和往来起见，双方同意基于（一）互相尊重领土主权、（二）互不侵犯、（三）互不干涉内政、（四）平等互惠、（五）和平共处的原则，缔结本协定。”
    序言中“中国西藏地方”清楚地说明西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，“两国人民”也就清楚地指明西藏人民是中国人民的一部分，中国是多民族的国家，西藏人民是伟大中国各族人民大家庭的成员。这两点是非常重要的。印度政府庄严地签订和批准了这个协定，这就说明印度已经确认西藏是中国领土的一部分，确认中国对西藏地方有完全的主权。
    因之，所谓“西藏是一个国家”，“中国对西藏只有宗主权，没有主权”等谬论，完全是英帝国主义侵略政策的产物。中国人民从来坚决反对而今后也将继续坚决反对这种谬论。我们相信，一切与中国友好的国家的政府和人民，也将同中国人民一起来反对这种谬论。
