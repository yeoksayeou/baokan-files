Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 31st - The International Democratic Women's Federation issued a statement on the "June 1st" International Children's Day on the 30th, according to a TASS report from Berlin. The statement said, "We demand the recognition of the rights of all children: namely, the right to receive social assistance, to be brought up in peace and friendship, to have sufficient nutrition and good housing, to enjoy cultural achievements, and to have rest and safety."

The statement continued, "We raise these demands for children in colonial and underdeveloped countries. They are starving and suffering from oppression and the consequences of war. We demand these rights for those children who have no food, no clothing, and no housing."

The statement pointed out that the millions of funds now spent on armaments should be used to guarantee children's clothing, food, housing, and schools, and to ensure that they have the opportunity to enjoy the urgently needed cultural achievements and rest.

The statement said that at present, in the hopeful atmosphere of the upcoming summit meeting, it is possible to strive for this demand, and it is possible to end nuclear weapons testing and the "Cold War."

    争取被压迫儿童获得权利
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：国际民主妇女联合会，于30日就“六一”国际儿童节发表一项声明。声明说，我们要求承认所有儿童的权利：即获得社会援助、受到和平友爱的教养、有足够的营养和良好的住宅、享受文化成果、休息和安全的权利。
    声明接着说，我们为殖民地和不发达国家的儿童提出这些要求。他们正在挨饿和遭受压迫和战争的后果，我们为那些没有食物、没有衣服、没有住宅的儿童要求这些权利。
    声明指出，现在花费在军备上的数以百万的资金，应当用来保证儿童的衣、食、住和学校，保证他们有可能享受迫切需要的文化成果和休息。
    声明说，目前，在即将举行的高级会议的充满希望的气氛中，有可能争取到这种要求，有可能结束核武器试验和“冷战”。
