Xinhua News Agency report:

    Wuxi County's spring silkworm rearing this year has increased by 29% compared to last spring. Currently, the first batch of hatched young silkworms have already mounted the frames and are spinning cocoons. All batches of young silkworms are developing uniformly, and the silkworms are large and strong. The excellent growth of spring cocoons has greatly encouraged silkworm farmers, cadres, and technicians, who have adopted many measures to strive for a bumper harvest of cocoons, focusing on the key issues in the later stages of spring silkworm growth. Bashi Commune has adopted a method of mutual cooperation between agricultural teams and specialized sericulture teams, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor for mulberry leaf picking. Due to the promotion of methods such as picking cleanly from the trees, gathering cleanly from the ground, and eating cleanly within the baskets, Taihu Commune not only does not feel a shortage of mulberry leaves, but also has surplus leaves to support other communes. Many communes also use penicillin, anti-stiffening powder, and garlic juice to supplement the silkworms' diet and prevent silkworm diseases. (Attached picture)

    无锡加强春蚕管理
    据新华社讯　无锡县今年饲养的春蚕比去年春季增加29％。目前，首批孵化的幼蚕已经上簇结茧，各批幼蚕发育都很整齐，蚕儿又大又壮。春茧生长良好的景象，大大鼓舞了蚕农、干部和技术人员，他们针对春蚕生长后期中的关键问题，采取了许多措施争取蚕茧丰收。八士公社采取了农业队与蚕桑专业队劳力相互协作的办法，解决了采桑劳力不足的困难。太湖公社由于推广了树上采清、地上拾清、筐内吃清等节约桑叶的办法，不但本公社的桑叶不感缺乏了，还有余叶支援其他公社。许多公社还用青霉素、防僵粉和大蒜汁等给蚕添食，防治蚕病。（附图片）
