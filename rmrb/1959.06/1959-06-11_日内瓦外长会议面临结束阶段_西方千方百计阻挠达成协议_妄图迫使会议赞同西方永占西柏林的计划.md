Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 9th June (By our correspondent Peng Di) The Foreign Ministers’ Conference is now approaching its conclusion. In the next week or so, it will be known whether the conference will end with some agreements being reached.

For a month, Western countries, especially the United States, have used various disruptive and delaying tactics to obstruct the reaching of an agreement. The clumsy “package deal” put forward by the US representative at the meeting is an example of the Western strategy of making any agreement impossible.

Since the conference began on May 29, in addition to holding formal plenary sessions, informal secret meetings have also been held. Western countries have had to discuss the West Berlin issue separately, quietly setting aside their “highly valued” but untenable principle that any part of their plan must be treated as an "indivisible whole". However, this retreat on procedural matters under the pressure of public opinion does not mean a substantial change in the Western attitude. On the West Berlin issue, they stubbornly cling to another untenable and outdated principle: their occupation status in West Berlin must be maintained.

However, the close concern shown by Western countries in the past ten days on the Berlin issue proves that reality cannot be ignored in practice. Even the Western countries themselves now have to admit that the status quo in West Berlin is abnormal, and some measures should be taken to "improve" this situation. They admit that there is indeed too much subversion, espionage and other sabotage activities organized by the West targeting East Berlin and the German Democratic Republic.

According to various sources, Western countries have put forward a five-point proposal on the Berlin issue at the secret meetings. Today's "Daily Telegraph" reported that these five points are: (1) Recognition of the Western "rights" in West Berlin. (2) Stipulating a "maximum limit" on the strength of Western troops stationed in West Berlin. (3) Reducing subversive activities. (4) Guaranteeing the right of access to and from West Berlin. (5) All the above measures shall remain in effect until Germany is reunified.

The above plan proves that the strategy implemented by Western countries is to make some technical adjustments in exchange for a permanent occupation status in West Berlin.

The Soviet delegation has explained to Western countries that the foundation of the West Berlin occupation status has long collapsed, and this status must be abolished to conform to the current political reality. In the spirit of reaching an agreement through negotiations, the Soviet delegation has put forward some alternative proposals to Western countries, including (1) The complete withdrawal of Western occupation forces. (2) The four countries, including the Soviet Union, can station some symbolic troops in West Berlin. (3) Some symbolic number of troops can be sent by neutral countries to replace Western troops.

Western countries turned a deaf ear to these Soviet proposals. On the contrary, they exerted various pressures and blackmail inside and outside the meeting place. Eisenhower made a speech in an attempt to harden the Western attitude at the Geneva conference. Adenauer made the decision to remain Prime Minister in order to personally strengthen the confidence of the cold war warriors. The US representative attending the Geneva conference on the non-continuation of nuclear weapons testing adopted a stubborn attitude in an attempt to obstruct an agreement. Finally, Western countries threatened that if the Soviet Union did not agree to the Western proposals, there would be no summit meeting.

As the meeting goes on day by day, all these acts of pressure and blackmail seem to be in vain. The Soviet Union has made its attitude clear: it will never conclude an agreement that would perpetuate the occupation system in West Berlin. If Western countries do not express a desire for peace, then the summit will not take place, and the whole world will know who should be held responsible for obstructing the summit.

    日内瓦外长会议面临结束阶段
    西方千方百计阻挠达成协议
    妄图迫使会议赞同西方永占西柏林的计划
    新华社日内瓦9日电　本社记者彭迪报道：外长会议目前正临近结束阶段。下周前后可以知道，会议是否会以达成一些协议而告终。
    一个月以来，西方国家，特别是美国一直使用种种破坏和拖延的策略来阻挠达成协议。美国代表在会上提出的拙劣的“一揽子计划”是说明西方想使任何协议都成为不可能的策略的一个例子。
    自从5月29日会议开始在举行正式的全体会议外还同时举行非正式的秘密会议以来，西方国家不得不单独地讨论西柏林问题，悄悄地把它们“深受重视的”、但是站不住脚的原则撇在一边，这个原则就是：必须将它们的计划的任何一个部分作为“不可分割的整体”来处理。但是，这种在舆论压力下实行的程序问题上的后退，并不意味着西方的态度发生实质上的变化。在西柏林问题上，它们死抱住另一个站不住脚的、过时的原则不放：它们在西柏林的占领地位必须保持。
    但是，过去十天西方国家在柏林问题上表现的密切的关心证明，现实在实际上是不能不顾的。即使西方国家自己现在也不得不承认，西柏林的现状是不正常的，应当采取一些措施来“改善”这种状况。它们承认，西方组织的针对东柏林和德意志民主共和国的颠复、间谍等破坏活动的确太多了。
    据各方面的消息，西方国家在秘密会议上提出了一个关于柏林问题的五点建议。今天的“每日电讯报”报道这五点是：（一）承认西方在西柏林的“权利”。（二）规定西方驻西柏林军队的兵力“最高限额”。（三）减少颠复活动。（四）保证进出西柏林的权利。（五）在德国重新统一以前，所有上述措施继续有效。
    上述计划证明，西方国家执行的策略是作出某些技术上的调整，以换得在西柏林永久的占领地位。
    苏联代表团已经向西方国家说明，西柏林占领地位的基础早已垮台了，这种地位必须取消，以符合目前的政治现实。本着通过谈判以达成协议的精神，苏联代表团给西方国家提出了一些替代的建议，其中包括（一）西方的占领军完全撤出。（二）包括苏联在内的四国可以在西柏林驻扎一些象征性军队。
  （三）由中立国家派驻一些象征性数量的军队来代替西方军队。
    西方国家对苏联的这些建议充耳不闻。恰恰相反，它们在会场内外施用种种压力和讹诈。艾森豪威尔发表谈话，企图使西方在日内瓦会议上的态度强硬起来。阿登纳作出留任总理的决定，以便亲自加强冷战战士的信心。参加日内瓦不继续试验核武器会议的美国代表采取死硬态度，企图阻挠协议。最后，西方国家威胁说，如果苏联不同意西方建议，那就不举行最高级会议。
    会议在一天天开下去，这一切施加压力和讹诈的行为看来都是徒劳的。苏联已经明确表示它的态度：它决不会缔结使西柏林的占领制度永久化的协议。如果西方国家不表示想获得和平的愿望，那么，最高级会议就开不成，而全世界将会知道，谁应当对阻挠最高级会议负责。（附图片）
