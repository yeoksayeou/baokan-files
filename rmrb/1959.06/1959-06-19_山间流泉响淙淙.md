Behind Dujiawan in Changshou County, Sichuan, across winding mountain roads, there is a steep and precipitous rocky mountain. The rocky mountain is surrounded by weeds, thorns, and verdant bamboo forests. A cool spring seeps out from a rock crevice more than ten feet high.

That year, when the cuckoo bird had just started chirping on the branches, a group of children from the village drove their cattle to the rocks to graze. The children cupped the spring water in their hands and drank it, splashing water and playing with each other. When tired, they lay on the grass, watching the blue sky through the gaps in the leaves.

“What good water!” Du Chunmu, the slightly older boy, said to Du Xiantang, turning to his side, “But in our village, we drink water from the fields and ditches! It would be great if we could bring this spring water home and drink it every day!”

Du Xiantang nodded, “That's right. Aunt Huang almost fell in the field trying to fetch some water. …But how can we get the water home?”

“Get it home?” Everyone thought about this question with both excitement and doubt. “Even Dr. Du couldn't do it, even after spending twelve *shi* of grain! Can we do it? Besides, what can we use for pipes?”

Indeed, there was such a Dr. Du, whom almost all the children had heard the old folks talk about. The thirty or so families in Dujiawan had been drinking water from the corners of the fields and ditches for generations. In times of drought, they had to climb over a steep and narrow mountain road more than a *li* away to fetch spring water. The big landlord at the head of the village, Dr. Du, was really ruthless. He said that the spring water was his and he would not let the people drink a drop! So, he spent twelve *shi* of grain to buy earthenware pots and hired some "foreign experts" to draw some kind of "white lines," planning to monopolize the spring water to build a flour mill and distillery. However, repairing water pipes required not only money but also talent. Of course, the people were not willing to work for the landlord, so Dr. Du shouted about the water pipes for several months but never got them built. After that, no one mentioned the matter of repairing water pipes again.

Du Chunmu thought for a while and said, “It doesn't matter, let’s try it. Look, we can cut down bamboo and drill through the nodes to make pipes.”

Everyone nodded, “That’s right, Chunmu is right, let’s try it!”

However, the "trial" had just started when it vanished like smoke. Because the bamboo was private property. The adults all said that the children were fooling around and forbade them from cutting bamboo. In this way, the matter of bringing water down the mountain was not accomplished.

The cuckoo bird was chirping on the branches again, and the spring of 1959 arrived! Dujiawan established a People's Commune, and Du Chunmu was already the captain of the Young Pioneers in the sixth grade of Cuntuo Elementary School. One day, he came back from school and heard someone calling him. He looked up and saw that it was the production team leader, Du Wanlu.

"Chunmu!" the team leader said, "Now spring plowing is very tight. We originally wanted to take out two laborers from the canteen who were carrying water, but there is no one to carry water." The team leader paused for a moment and said, "The clear spring on the rocks is really good water. Why don't you children find a way to bring it to the canteen? This will not only save manpower, but also allow us to drink good water!"

Du Chunmu's heart was thumping. He never thought that the thing he had been hoping for for several years would be realized this year. Wasn't the school's Young Pioneers department calling on everyone to do good deeds for the People's Commune? Bringing water to the commune is such a good thing! "But we don't have anything!"

The team leader seemed to have guessed his thoughts and said, "As long as you are willing to work, the Party and the commune will definitely support you. Bamboo, tools, ... the commune will provide everything!"

Du Chunmu was extremely happy and quickly told his little companions in the village. Everyone clapped their hands and was so happy that they couldn't close their mouths.

They started working immediately. The next day, the Young Pioneers climbed the steep rocky mountain and cut down bamboo with rustling sounds. When the water pipes were ready, they began to open up the road for laying the pipes. Boulders and thorns hindered the passage of the water pipes, so they shoveled away the weeds and thorns and raised their axes to split the boulders. As they worked, their arms ached and blisters formed on their palms. Just then, Uncle Du Wanzhi and Uncle Wu, who had been sent by the commune to help, came carrying large iron hammers and thick steel chisels. The children jumped up happily: "As long as the commune supports us, the stones can't be harder than us!"

After all the preparatory work was done, they began to lay the water pipes. A thick bamboo pipe was chiseled into the rock crevice where the water flowed, and then a bamboo frame was erected under the low-lying rocks. Along the rocks and along the paths, bamboo pipes were connected one by one. There were many small slopes along the way, and some partners wanted to split them with knives and axes, which was indeed very troublesome. One little partner innocently said, "It would be great if the spring water could climb slopes!"

This interesting question immediately attracted everyone. Du Chunmu was lost in thought for a while, and suddenly shouted excitedly: "Students, water can climb slopes! In natural science class, the teacher once talked about the principle of siphon pipes. As long as the middle slope is not higher than the place where the water flows out, the pressure of the water flowing from the high place can make the water climb over the slope." So, they started working, connecting bamboo pipes from the low place to the high place. Sure enough, the water climbed over the slope, "哗哗" flowing over the small slope and then flowing to the foot of the slope.

The clear spring, leaping through the ancient mountain forest, sang "哗哗哗" as it rushed towards Dujiawan, entering the stone tank of the commune's canteen.

The people of Dujiawan were as happy as if it were a festival. Everyone surrounded the cool spring water, cheering. The team leader said endlessly, "The Young Pioneers have done a great thing for our Dujiawan. What the landlords couldn't do in the past, they have done!"

    山间流泉响淙淙
    赵世泉
    四川长寿县杜家湾背后，隔着一条条弯弯曲曲的山路，有一座陡峭险峻的山岩，山岩周围长满了野草、荆棘和青幽幽的竹林，一股清凉的泉水从丈多高的岩缝里渗出来。
    那年，布谷鸟刚刚在枝头跳叫的时候，湾里头一群小孩就赶着牛群到岩上来吃草了。孩子们捧着泉水喝着，浇着水互相嬉戏。累了，就躺在草地上，透过枝叶的缝隙望着蓝天。
      “多好的水哟！”年龄稍大点的杜春木侧着身对杜贤堂说，“可是我们湾里却喝的是田头和沟里头的水！把这股泉水引到家里来天天都喝得到，那才好哇！”
    杜贤堂点着头，“可不是吗，黄婶婶为了挑点水吃，险些摔在田里去了哩。……可是，我们怎样才能把水引到家里去呢？”
      “引到家里去？”大家又喜欢又惊疑地想着这个问题。“人家杜医官花了十二石黄谷都没搞成，我们还行？再说，拿什么做水管呢？”
    的确有那么一个杜医官，差不多所有的孩子都听老年人说过。杜家湾三十来户人家，祖祖代代都是喝的田角沟边的水，天旱了才爬过里多远又陡又窄的山路去挑泉水。湾头的大地主杜医官真狠啦。他说：泉水是他的，一滴也不让老百姓喝！于是，他花了十二石黄谷买瓦罐，请些“洋先生”来划什么“白线”，计划独吞泉水搞粉房、糟房。但是，修水管除了钱还有人才行，当然罗，老百姓再怎么说也不肯替地主卖力，结果，杜医官吼了几个月的水管始终没修起。以后，再也没人提修水管的事了。
    杜春木想了一会，说：“不要紧，我们来试试看。你们瞧：把竹子砍下来，钻通竹节就是水管。”
    大家都点着头，“行，春木讲的对，我们试试看！”
    可是，“试”的工作刚刚开了个头，就烟消云散了。因为竹子是私人的。大人们都说小孩在胡闹，不准他们砍竹子。就这样，引水下山的事情没干成。
    布谷鸟又在枝头上鸣叫，1959年的春天到了！杜家湾成立了人民公社，杜春木已经是寸沱小学六年级的少先队中队长。一天，他从学校回来，听见有人在喊他，抬头一看，原来是生产队长杜万禄。
    “春木！”队长说：“现在春耕紧得很，本想把食堂两个挑水的劳力抽出来，但又没人挑水。”队长停了一会，又说：“岩上那股清泉可真是好水，你们孩子们想法把它引到食堂里来吧，这样不但省了人力，还可以喝到好水！”
    杜春木心头突突突地跳着，真没想到：望了好几年的事今年望着了。学校少先队部不是正在号召大家为人民公社做好事吗？给公社引水，那够多好啊！“可是，我们什么东西都没有呀！”
    队长似乎猜出了他的心思，说：“只要你们肯干，党和公社一定支持，竹子啦，工具啦，……公社全都给！”
    杜春木高兴极了，连忙告诉给湾里的小同伴，大家都拍着手，欢喜得合不上嘴来。
    说干就干。第二天，少先队员们就攀上陡峭的山岩，必必剥剥地砍伐竹子。水管准备好了，他们动手开辟铺设水管的道路。乱石和荆棘阻碍水管通过，于是，他们铲掉野草和荆棘又高举起斧头劈打乱石。干着干着，他们的手臂震酸了，手掌打起了血泡。正在这时，社里派来帮忙的杜万智大叔和吴伯伯扛着大铁锤、粗钢钎来了。孩子们高兴得跳了起来：“只要公社支持，石头再硬也硬不过我们！”
    一切准备工作都作好了后，他们就动手铺设水管。一节粗大的竹管凿入流水的岩缝，然后在低凹的岩下搭起竹架。沿着山岩、沿着小径，竹管子一节节连接起来。路上有许多小坡，有的伙伴想用刀斧来劈，那的确很费事。一个小伙伴天真地说：“泉水能够爬坡就好了！”
    这个有趣的问题立刻吸引了大家。杜春木呆想了好一会，忽然兴奋地叫起来：“同学们，水能够爬坡！在自然课里，老师曾经讲过虹吸管的道理，只要中间的坡坡不高于水流出来的地方，高处流水的压力是能够使水爬过坡的。”于是，他们动起手来，用竹管连接着由低处延伸到高处。果然，水爬过坡了，“哗哗”地翻过小坡再流向坡脚。
    清泉，跳跃着穿过古老山林的清泉，“哗哗哗”地唱着歌，奔向杜家湾，进入公社食堂的石缸。
    杜家湾的人高兴得像过节一样，大家围住清凉的泉水，欢呼着。队长话不绝口地说：“红领巾为咱杜家湾做了桩大好事。过去地主干不成的事，他们干成了！”
