    People's Teachers are a Glorious Profession
    ——A Letter to This Year's High School Graduates
		By Liu Fonian, Vice President of East China Normal University

    Students, every year at this time—when high school students are about to graduate—I want to talk to young friends who are preparing to apply to universities about the normal school (teacher training) profession. You might say that every profession is needed by the country and is important, so there is no need to particularly emphasize the importance of teaching. I do not want to say that the work of teachers is more important than all other work. I also know that the work of teachers is only a component of the country's overall construction, although it is an indispensable part. However, I think people do not fully recognize its importance. I find that some people have a tendency to see things but not people. They believe that for our country to move towards communism, we must develop production, and to develop production, we must rely on raw materials, machines, and other material conditions. They often overlook another factor, the human factor. You know, the same raw materials and machines in the hands of different people often produce very different results. Therefore, our Party, the government, and the entire society attach so much importance to the education of the people.

    Everyone knows that adolescence is a period of education, a period of greatest plasticity. Our ideals, beliefs, viewpoints, hobbies, habits, etc., are often formed during this period. Although there will be changes and developments later, we can always see the influence of the education a person received during their youth. The knowledge and skills learned in adolescence are of great use both for a person's future work and for their further studies. Therefore, every effort should be made to educate and cultivate the younger generation into cultured laborers with socialist consciousness.

    At present, the country needs not only a large number of teachers, but also many very excellent teachers. Because our school education must not only develop, but also improve. Without excellent teachers, it is unimaginable to improve the quality of teaching. Therefore, I feel that I should explain the significance of the teaching profession in the country's construction to the vast number of young students, for their reference when choosing a major.

    Speaking of the teaching profession, you will definitely feel that this is a relatively familiar profession. Because from elementary school onwards, you have been in contact with teachers, you have lived with teachers for many years, and of course you know what kind of work teachers do. However, as everyone knows, people do not truly understand certain things simply because they are frequently in contact with them. Because we often only see the phenomena, but not the essence. Some young students have various misunderstandings about the nature of teaching work. For example, some young people think that teaching work is very ordinary. Young people like to do great and vigorous things; can you say that this is a bad thing? I think, on the contrary, this is a good thing. Young students should be energetic, strive for progress, and have lofty ambitions. However, they only see teachers giving classes, correcting homework, tutoring, and doing routine ideological work every day, and they feel that these tasks are very ordinary and very trivial; they do not see that it is through such concrete and meticulous work that the younger generation grows up day by day. After several years of education, young people grow up, they gradually mature in thought and knowledge, and they become activists, advanced figures, and model figures in various jobs, making great contributions to the country. During this period, the seedlings that teachers have diligently cultivated for many years bloom and bear fruit. The more meticulous and concrete the cultivation work is, the more luxuriant the flowers bloom, and the more abundant the fruits are. Think about it, isn't this an extremely vigorous work? We cultivate generations of people to transform nature and transform the world, isn't this a great undertaking that turns the universe around?

    Some young people also feel that the work of teachers is very monotonous and boring, and does not require any remarkable knowledge, skills, or qualities. Therefore, they think that going to normal university is meaningless. In my opinion, this is still only seeing some superficial phenomena. For a truly responsible teacher, teaching is the most attractive work. Excellent teachers always have great hopes for their students. They are excited by every small, even very small, progress of their students, and they are also worried about their still existing shortcomings. The growth and changes of students constantly stir their hearts. A class is taught very well, attracting the students' attention, the students' eyes radiate joy, and their faces show knowing smiles. After investigation, it is proved that the students have mastered the knowledge you have taught them. At this time, all the hard work the teacher has endured in preparing the lesson disappears, and only happiness fills his heart. Teachers are worried about their students with shortcomings, but they never lose faith in them, and they persevere in working with them. It is possible that no results are seen even after working for a considerable period of time, and they may feel distressed, but they do not waver. Due to their efforts, these students finally become good students, their shortcomings are overcome, and their excellent qualities are developed. At this time, the teacher is happy. Is there anyone in the world happier than him? Perhaps there is. But the teacher himself feels that he is the happiest person in the world.

    Students, some young people may still be influenced by the thoughts of the old society. In the old society, teachers were often looked down upon, and people thought that those who did this kind of work were people without a future. But, do young people today still want to let these old thoughts hold them back? Society has changed, everything has changed. The situation in which teachers are looked down upon will never return in our country. Here, teachers are fully respected and cared for. The work of teachers is glorious work.

    I must end my letter. Please allow me, as an educator, to express a warm welcome to the young friends among you who are determined to join the great ranks of people's teachers.

### 人民教师是光荣的岗位——写给本届高中毕业同学的一封信

    人民教师是光荣的岗位
    ——写给本届高中毕业同学的一封信	华东师范大学副校长  刘佛年
    同学们，每年到了这一个时候—高中学生快要毕业的时候—我就要向准备投考高等学校的青年朋友们谈谈师范专业。你们也许会说，每一项专业都是国家所需要的，都是重要的，因此就不必特别强调教师工作的重要性。我并不想把教师的工作说得比其他的一切工作都重要。我也知道教师工作只是国家全部建设工作的一个组成部分，虽然是一个必不可少的部分。但是，我认为人们对它的重要性是认识不足的。我发现有些人有一种见物不见人的倾向。他们认为，我们的国家要走向共产主义，就要发展生产，而要发展生产，就要靠原料、机器等物质条件。他们常常忽略了另一个因素，那就是人的因素。你们知道，同样的原料和机器掌握在不同的人的手里，往往会产生迥然不同的结果。因此我们的党、政府和整个的社会，才那么重视人民的教育问题。
    谁都知道，青少年时期是一个受教育的时期，是可塑性最大的一个时期。我们的理想、信仰、观点、爱好、习惯等等，往往都是在这个时期形成的。以后虽然还会有改变和发展，但我们总是可以从一个人身上，看到他在青少年时期所受的教育的影响的。在青少年时期所学到的知识和技能，无论对一个人以后的工作或是对他进一步的学习来说，都是有很大的作用的。所以，应该尽一切努力把年青的一代，教育培养成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    目前国家既需要数量很大的教师，还需要许多非常优秀的教师。因为我们的学校教育不仅要发展，而且要提高。没有优秀的教师，提高教学质量是不可想像的。所以，我觉得应该向广大的青年同学们，说明教师工作在国家建设中的意义，以供同学们在选择专业时参考。
    说起教师这个专业，你们一定会觉得这是比较熟悉的一种专业。因为从小学起，你们就接触了教师，你们和教师在一起生活了多年，当然知道教师做的是一些什么工作。但是，大家都知道，人们并不因为经常接触某些事物，就能真正理解这些事物。因为我们往往只看到现象，而看不到本质。有些青年学生对教师工作的性质就有种种的误解。例如，有些青年认为教师工作很平凡。青年们喜欢干轰轰烈烈的事业，你能说这是不好的事情吗？我看，恰恰相反，这是好事情。青年学生应该是朝气蓬勃，奋发有为，怀抱雄心大志。但是，他们只看见教师每天上课、改本子、辅导、做日常思想工作，就觉得这些工作很平凡、很琐碎；他们没有看到，正是通过这样一些具体的、细致的工作，年青一代才一天天地成长起来。经过若干年的教育，青年长大了，他们在思想上、知识上逐渐成熟了，他们成了各种工作岗位上的积极分子、先进人物和模范人物，对国家作出巨大的贡献。在这时期，教师多年来辛勤培育的幼苗开花了，结果了。培育工作做得越细致、具体，花儿开得越茂盛，果实结得越丰硕。你们想想看，这难道不是一种极其轰轰烈烈的工作吗？我们培养了一代代的人去改造自然，改造世界，这难道不是一种旋转乾坤的伟大事业吗？
    也有些青年觉得教师的工作很单调、枯燥，并不需要什么了不起的知识、本领和素养。因此他们认为上师范大学毫无意义。在我看来，这还是只看到了一些表面的现象。对一个真正认真负责的教师来说，教师工作是一种最吸引人的工作。优秀的教师，对他的学生总是抱着很大的希望。他为自己学生的每一点、那怕是很小的进步而感到兴奋，也为他们仍旧存在的缺点感到忧虑。学生的成长变化，经常激动着他们的心灵。一堂课上得很好，吸引了学生的注意，学生的眼睛里放出了喜悦的光芒，脸上发出会心的微笑。经过调查，证明学生已经掌握了你所授给他们的知识，这时候，教师在备课时所经受的辛劳，全都消失了，充满他的心胸的只有快乐。教师对他的那些有着缺点的学生感到忧虑，但是他对他们永远不失去信心，还坚韧地对他们进行工作。也可能往往工作了一个相当时期还看不到任何效果，他也许会苦恼，但是毫不动摇。由于他的努力，这些学生终于变成了好学生，缺点克服了，优秀的品质发扬了。这时候的教师是幸福的。世界上是否有人比他更幸福呢？也许有。但是教师自己感到他是世间最幸福的人。
    同学们，有些青年可能还受着旧社会的思想影响。在旧社会教师是常常被人看不起的，认为干这种工作的人是没有出息的人。但是，现在的青年难道还要让这些旧的思想把自己拖住吗？社会变了，一切都变了。教师被人看不起的情况，在我们这个国家中一去不复返了。在我们这里，教师是受到充分的尊重和关怀的。教师的工作是光荣的工作。
  我不能不结束我的信了。请让我以一个教育工作者的身份，向你们当中决心参加人民教师伟大行列的青年朋友们，表示热烈的欢迎。
