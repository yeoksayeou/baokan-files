　　Withered Before Blooming
　　Yuan Ying

　　Around the time of June 1st, I accompanied several Korean comrades to the Shanghai Children's Palace to celebrate the festival with the children. On the lawn, a performance was underway: "Korean Little Girl," depicting the friendship between the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers. The children sang and danced, their affection overflowing, leaving the entire audience of young spectators in complete silence, totally absorbed. Even though we were standing far away, unable to hear clearly, we felt as if we were in the green hills and clear waters of Korean soil.

　　My Korean friend, Lao Wu, said to me in a low voice:
　　"I, seeing them, think of the children of Korea. Children, are happiness."
　　Lao Wu has only been in China for three months, and his Chinese is not yet fluent, but his meaning, plus his gestures, I completely understand. I added:
　　"But, the children of South Korea..."
　　Lao Wu spread his hands, shook his head, and a shadow crossed his face.

　　Yes, the children of South Korea, at this time, in this place, in this scene, how can we not think of you, think of you living in that human hell!

　　War and poverty, how many orphans have they added to South Korea! You have lost your parents, wandering the streets. Syngman Rhee, in order to decorate the facade, had to set up a few orphanages to deal with social opinion. But, aren't those orphanages also prisons of hunger! Look at what the South Korean newspapers report: "They all live lives of not having enough to eat and not enough to wear... They usually eat barley rice and salty salt soup, and wear tattered clothes... The orphans all suffer from malnutrition." How can such days be lived? Late one night at the end of last year, in an orphanage in Daejeon, more than sixty orphans used escape to accuse the crimes of the American-Rhee gang.

　　However, in that human hell, where can you escape? Waiting for you are even more miserable days, perhaps even without salty salt soup to drink. Outside Busan Harbor, aren't American ships waiting for you? Syngman Rhee, with his hands stained with the blood of the Korean people, signed a new bloody contract, selling you as slaves to American farm owners. More than two thousand five hundred young, bud-like lives were silently erased by that traitor. Two thousand five hundred more Kim Cheol, Dong Hyung, Seong Ji, where are you now? Perhaps, you are in the Pacific Ocean, locked in the stuffy cabin like piglets, sailing east in raging waves, looking back at your motherland, but your motherland is getting farther and farther away, faintly disappearing where the sea meets the sky. Perhaps, the farm owner's whip is flying over your heads, you look at the bloody backs of your companions, swallowing your tears...

　　Dear children, can you hear the voice of your motherland? She is calling you across the ocean like an Amani calling her children!

　　Children who have not yet been sold, children who are still enduring torment in that great hell, do you know how your motherland, your elders, are concerned about you?

　　I think of you, Kim Kwang-hyung, a fifteen-year-old middle school student in Seoul, you had to end your life with a rope because you couldn't pay the school's pressing "public dues." I think of you, Lee Ki-jun, a rural child from Yangju County, Gyeonggi Province, more than two months ago, American soldiers robbed your money and strangled you to death with a belt. Under the shroud of gloomy clouds, under the swords and shadows of American soldiers, what kind of days are you living? Your father committed suicide with a kitchen knife due to hunger; your mother and sisters were kidnapped by American beast soldiers, without a trace; your brother wanders the streets with a sign hanging around his neck: "Please buy my eyes"; your younger siblings were crushed into a bloody mess by a jeep...

　　You were originally the buds of early spring, but before you could bloom, you were ravaged by storms, withered, and faded. And you have the right to survive, until the season of a tapestry of flowers.

　　For the flowers of humanity, to allow them to receive warm sunshine and rich nourishment, can we still allow jackals to run rampant? Can we still allow those man-eating savages to do whatever they want on the beautiful land of Korea?

　　No!

　　Haze will eventually be swept away by the east wind. The children of South Korea will eventually be able to sing and dance happily like the children of the northern part of the Republic. The Han River should be filled with children's laughter, like the Taedong River, and not filled with their tears. Free and happy flowers will eventually bloom in the mountains and fields of the southern half of Korea, like the endless Mugunghwa. This day will surely come. We must make this day come sooner!

    未开先萎
    袁鹰
    六一前夕，我陪几位朝鲜同志在上海少年宫同孩子们一起欢度佳节。在草坪上，正演出一个节目：“朝鲜小姑娘”，演的是朝鲜人民同中国人民志愿军战士的友谊，孩子们且歌且舞，一往情深，惹得全场小观众鸦雀无声，全神贯注。我们虽站在远处，听不真切，但是也仿佛置身于青山绿水的朝鲜国土上了。
    我的朝鲜朋友老吴，低声对我说：
    “我，看到他们，就想到朝鲜的小孩。小孩，是幸福的。”
    老吴来中国才三个多月，中国话还不是那么熟练，但是他的意思，加上他做的手势，我是完全明白的。我补充了一句：
    “可是，南朝鲜的孩子……”
    老吴把双手一摊，摇摇头，脸上掠过一层阴云。
    是的，南朝鲜的孩子们呀，在此时此地，此情此景，叫我们怎能不想起你们，想起生活在那个人间地狱里的你们啊！
    战争和贫穷，给南朝鲜增加了多少孤儿！你们失去了爹娘，流落街头，李承晚为了装点门面，不得不设立几个孤儿院，来对付社会舆论。可是，那样的孤儿院又何尝不是饥饿的牢狱！且看南朝鲜的报上登的吧：“他们都过着吃不饱、穿不暖的生活……他们平常吃的是大麦饭和咸盐汤，穿的是破烂不堪的衣服……。孤儿们都患营养不良症。”这种日子怎么能过得下？去年年底的一个深夜里，大田市的一个孤儿院里，六十多个孤儿，用逃走来控诉美李匪帮的罪恶。
    然而，在那个人间地狱里，你们又能往哪儿逃？等着你们的，是更加凄惨、也许连咸盐汤都喝不上的日子。釜山港外，美国船不是正等着你们吗？李承晚，用他那沾满了朝鲜人民鲜血的手，签下了新的血腥的合同，把你们当作奴隶卖给美国的农场老板了。二千五百多个年青的、花苞一般的生命，就这样无声无息地被那个卖国贼抹掉了。两千五百多个金喆、东亨、圣姬呀，你们如今正在哪儿呀？也许，你们正在太平洋上，像猪仔一样被关在闷郁的船舱里，在惊涛骇浪里往东驶，回头望祖国，祖国却一步步落远了，在海天相接处隐隐地不见了。也许，农场主的皮鞭正在你们头上飞舞，你们望着同伴的血淋淋的脊背，把眼泪往肚里咽……
    亲爱的孩子们呀，你们听到祖国的声音吗？她像阿妈妮叫孩子那样，隔着重洋在呼唤你们哩！
    还没有被卖掉的孩子们，还在那个大地狱里忍受着煎熬的孩子们呀，你们知道你们的祖国、你们的长辈们怎样在关怀着你们吗？
    我想起了你金光亨，汉城的一个十五岁的中学生，你为了缴不起学校催逼的一笔“公纳金”，不得不用一根绳子结束自己的生命。我想起了你李基俊，京畿道杨州郡的一个农村孩子，两个多月前，美国兵抢走了你的钱，还用皮带把你勒死。在愁云惨雾的笼罩下，在美国兵的刀光剑影下，你们过的是什么日子呀！你们的父亲，为了饥饿，用菜刀自杀；你们的妈妈和姐姐，被美国兽兵掳走，无影无踪；你们的哥哥，徘徊在街头，颈上挂着一个牌子：“请买我的眼睛”；你们的弟弟妹妹，被吉普车压得血肉模糊。……
    你们原是初春的蓓蕾，可是，还没等到开放，就受到狂风暴雨的摧残，枯萎了，雕谢了。而你们是有权利生存下去，直到万花如锦的时节的。
    为了人类的花朵，为了让它们得到和煦的阳光和丰富的滋养，我们还能允许豺狼横行吗？还能允许那些吃人的生番在朝鲜的锦绣的国土上为所欲为吗？
    不能！
    阴霾，总归要被东风扫净的。南朝鲜的孩子，总归能像共和国北部的孩子们那样幸福地歌舞的。汉江应该跟大同江一样，充满孩子们的笑声，而不应该充满他们的泪水。自由幸福的鲜花总归会盛开在朝鲜南半部的山野，就像无穷花那样绵绵不断。这日子一定会到来的。我们要让这日子早点来到！（附图片）
