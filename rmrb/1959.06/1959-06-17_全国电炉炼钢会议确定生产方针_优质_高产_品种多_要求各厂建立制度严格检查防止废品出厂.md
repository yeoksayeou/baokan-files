Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, June 16th. The first National Electric Furnace Steelmaking Experience Exchange Conference was held in Lushun-Dalian from June 6th to 13th. The conference called on steel mills equipped with electric furnaces to continue carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, strengthen enterprise management, improve the output and quality of electric furnace steel, increase varieties, and further meet the country's urgent need for high-quality steel grades.

The conference pointed out that since last year, electric furnace steel production has achieved great development, steel output has grown rapidly, and the average utilization coefficient of electric furnaces has increased from 18.62 in 1957 to 22.66; at the same time, a variety of new steel grades have been created. However, on the other hand, some factories and some products have shown a downward trend in quality. Although there has been some improvement recently, it still has not reached the proper level.

The conference believes that the quality problems, in addition to raw materials and technical factors, are in most cases due to insufficient ideological emphasis on improving quality while increasing output, and therefore technical management work has not been able to keep up in a timely manner. The conference believes that the practice of Dalian Steel Plant proves that there is no insurmountable contradiction between output and quality. The raw material conditions of this factory are not particularly good, but because they can recognize and master objective conditions and actively take measures, not only is the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces the highest in the country, but the quality of electric furnace steel is also the best. Since the beginning of this year, the qualified rate of steel ingots has been above 99%.

The conference pointed out that in the future, electric furnace steel production must implement the policy of "high yield, high quality, and wide variety," and the current focus should be on quality issues. The conference formulated measures to improve quality, requiring all factories to strengthen ideological education on the importance of quality for workers, strengthen technical management, quickly establish a technical supervision system, strictly inspect product quality, implement technical standards, prevent defective products from leaving the factory, and conscientiously implement the original record and quality analysis system, hold regular quality meetings, and promptly propose measures to improve quality. In the management of raw materials, implement a method of classification and ranking, and graded management, in order to make rational use.

Based on extensive exchanges of experience, the conference summarized several major advanced experiences in improving steel output and quality, and incorporated these experiences into the newly revised electric furnace steelmaking operating procedures for promotion in electric steel mills across the country. These experiences include the use of spare furnace bodies on electric furnaces with top charging, fully exploiting the potential of transformers, implementing preheating of raw materials outside the furnace, rational overloading, advanced oxygen blowing or adding ore in the late stage of melting, comprehensive deoxidation, and mixed steelmaking, etc.

The conference also put forward a preliminary plan to expand the production of new steel grades, requiring scientific research departments and the central laboratories of various factories to strengthen the research work of new steel grades, and the production, research, and use units should collaborate in trial production to rapidly develop the variety of alloy steel in China and improve the level of production technology.

Participating in this conference were representatives from seventeen steelmaking enterprises and relevant research institutions and universities.

    全国电炉炼钢会议确定生产方针
    优质　高产　品种多
    要求各厂建立制度严格检查防止废品出厂
    新华社旅大16日电　全国第一次电炉炼钢经验交流会议6日到13日在旅大举行。会议要求采用电炉设备的炼钢厂继续开展技术革新和技术革命运动，加强企业管理，提高电炉钢的产量、质量，增加品种，进一步满足国家对优质钢种的迫切需要。
    会议指出，去年以来电炉炼钢生产获得了很大发展，钢产量增长很快，电炉平均利用系数由1957年的十八点六二提高到二十二点六六；同时创造了多种新钢种。但是，另一方面，也有一些工厂和一些产品出现了质量下降的趋势，最近虽然有所改善，但仍然没有达到应有的水平。
    会议认为，质量问题的产生，除了原料和技术方面的因素以外，在多数情况下，是由于思想上对提高产量必须同时提高质量重视不够，因而技术管理工作没有能够及时跟上去。会议认为，大连钢厂的实践证明，产量和质量之间没有不可克服的矛盾。这个工厂的原料条件并不特别好，由于他们能够认识和掌握客观条件，积极采取措施，不仅电炉利用系数在全国居于首位，电炉钢的质量也是最好的，今年以来钢锭合格率一直在99％以上。
    会议指出，今后电炉炼钢生产必须贯彻“高产、优质、多品种”的方针，当前要着重抓质量问题。会议订出了改进质量的措施，要求各厂对职工群众加强重视质量的思想教育，加强技术管理，迅速建立技术监督制度，严格检查产品质量，执行技术标准，防止废品出厂，认真贯彻原始纪录和质量分析制度，定期举行质量会议，及时提出改进质量的措施。在原料材料管理上实行分类排队，分级管理的办法，以便合理使用。
    会议在广泛交流经验的基础上，总结出了几项提高钢的产量和质量的重大先进经验，并将这些经验纳入新修订的电炉炼钢操作规程，在全国各电炉钢厂推行。这些经验包括在炉顶装料的电炉上采用备用炉体，充分发挥变压器的潜力，实行原料炉外预热，合理超装，在熔化末期提前吹氧或加矿石，综合脱氧和混合炼钢等。
  会议还提出了扩大新钢种生产的初步方案，要求科学研究部门和各厂的中心试验室加强新钢种的研究工作，生产、研究、使用单位三者协同试制，以迅速发展我国合金钢的品种和提高生产技术水平。
    参加这次会议的有十七个炼钢企业和有关研究机关、大专学校的代表。
