The chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification, Han Xueye

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Council held in February this year and the 19th meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in Warsaw in April decided to designate June 25 this year as "Day of Struggle for the Withdrawal of US Troops from South Korea," calling on peace organizations and workers' organizations of all countries to launch an international movement to demand the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea. Recently, the special meeting of the World Peace Council once again emphasized in the "Recommendations on the Current Situation in Asia and Africa" that the troops of US imperialism should immediately withdraw from South Korea.

In this way, peace-loving people all over the world have once again expressed their unanimous support for the entire Korean people who are struggling for lasting world peace and the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Encouraged by this support, the entire Korean people are welcoming the arrival of "June 25" - the day US imperialism launched its war of aggression in Korea - in a vigorous struggle to win lasting world peace and the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Since liberation, the Korean people have been waging a strong struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

The statement issued by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5, 1958, regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea, is of great significance to this struggle. This statement puts forward the most just and reasonable plan for opening up a path for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue under the current situation. Therefore, this statement has received the full support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world.

The Chinese government was the first to express its approval of our government's proposal. The Chinese People's Volunteers were the first to take the initiative to withdraw completely from North Korea. Their actions opened up a new situation for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Under these circumstances, our government issued another statement on October 28 last year, advocating that the US aggressor troops should immediately withdraw from South Korea. However, the US imperialist aggressors still want to continue to linger in South Korea.

The US military blatantly violates the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement, frantically strengthens its armaments; and in order to intensify the tension in Korea, it shamelessly carries out arrogant military provocations. In order to turn South Korea into an atomic war base threatening peace in the Far East and Asia, the US imperialists moved the United Nations Command to Seoul as early as July 1957, and transferred the US First Armored Division, originally stationed in Japan, to South Korea to enhance the military strength of the US military. At the same time, they also expanded the Rhee Syngman puppet army from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions. They also unilaterally announced the abolition of Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement prohibiting the entry of military supplies, and since last year, they have been shipping various new weapons such as 280 cm atomic cannons, "Honest John" rockets, and "Matador" missiles into South Korea to reorganize the US military stationed in South Korea into atomic divisions. At the same time, they also held large-scale "US-ROK joint" "atomic mobile exercises" near the military demarcation line.

These actions of US imperialism prove that it opposes peace and prepares for war; opposes Korean reunification and wants to maintain its permanent division, and attempts to maintain its colonial rule in South Korea forever.

Since the day the US military occupied South Korea, the US imperialists have imposed brutal colonial rule on South Korea. Due to the US colonial plunder policy and militarization policy, as well as the tyranny of the Rhee Syngman gang, South Korean industry has plummeted. At present, the originally pitiful factories and mines left by the Japanese imperialists in South Korea are almost fragmented, and what remains are only some handicraft-style small and medium-sized enterprises, which are also suffering from severe raw material shortages, power shortages, and capital shortages under the oppression of US monopoly capitalists and a small number of comprador capitalists. More than 80% of them have been forced to suspend work or shorten production time.

The situation in the rural economy is also the same. The sown area has decreased by about 600,000 cho (町步) compared with the Japanese rule period, and the total grain output, even in the best year of last year, is only about 70% of the Japanese rule period.

The rural economy of South Korea has been exhausted, and the peasants have suffered unprecedented cruel plunder.

South Korea now has an army of 6.6 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people wandering the streets, and millions of farmers without food are starving. This shows that the South Korean economy has reached the brink of bankruptcy.

Under the instigation of the US imperialists, Rhee Syngman not only sold the entire resources of South Korea to the American masters, plunging South Korean compatriots into a living hell, but now even wants to sell compatriots who have no food or clothing to foreign countries as slaves.

Under the direction of its American masters, the Rhee Syngman gang is transporting large numbers of South Korean unemployed, poor farmers, residents of northern Korea kidnapped by the enemy during the last war, and young and middle-aged people discharged from the Rhee Syngman army to foreign countries under the pretext of so-called "immigration".

On May 11 this year, the Rhee Syngman gang promulgated the "Overseas Immigration Committee Law" in preparation for the large-scale implementation of its criminal "immigration" plan.

In view of this, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued another statement on May 22 this year, condemning the Rhee Syngman gang's criminal conspiracy and strongly demanding that all our compatriots who are to be forcibly deported abroad by the US-Rhee gang be transferred to the northern part of the Republic.

In stark contrast to the tragic situation in South Korea, the people of North Korea are making great achievements in the socialist construction of their motherland and living an increasingly improved and happy life.

Our country, which was economically very backward, has now become an industrial-agricultural country with a solid foundation of an independent national economy.

In 1958, our country's industrial output was four times that of the pre-war year of 1949. All the working people of our country have successfully completed the production plan for the first quarter of this year, and the total industrial output value has increased by 80% compared with the same period last year. In this way, our people have completed 87% of the targets of the first five-year plan.

Our country's working people, filled with patriotic enthusiasm, are determined to overfulfill the first five-year plan ahead of schedule within this year, two years ahead of schedule.

Our country's farmers have made great efforts in rural water conservancy, which has brought about tremendous changes in rural areas. Our country's work on the mechanization and electrification of agriculture has also achieved remarkable results. Since September last year, many reservoirs, pumping stations, and other agricultural projects have been established in our country's rural areas. The irrigated area added in this short period is almost three times the irrigated area added during the entire period of Japanese rule.

The people in the northern half of the Republic eagerly hope to share the fruits of their labor with the people in the southern half, and are making all preparations to welcome the South Korean unemployed, displaced farmers, and wartime orphans who are still struggling in disaster today, so that they can be guaranteed a stable life.

The people in the northern half of the Republic are also making all preparations to welcome our compatriots suffering pain and disaster in Japan, so that they can return home and live a happy new life.

However, the US-Rhee gang not only obstructs the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, but is also plotting to force domestic compatriots to be deported to foreign countries as well.

The root cause of all the disasters and sufferings suffered by the South Korean compatriots is the US imperialists' occupation of South Korea.

If the US aggressor troops had not occupied South Korea, the Korean people would have peacefully unified their motherland long ago, and the people of North and South Korea would have lived a happy and prosperous life together in harmony.

Korea belongs to the Korean people.

The Korean issue should be peacefully resolved by the Koreans themselves.

No matter what means the US aggressors use, they can never find a legitimate basis for their occupation of South Korea.

The troops of US imperialism must immediately withdraw from South Korea!

This is the unanimous demand and proposition of all peace-loving people in all countries who are concerned about peace in Korea and peace in the Far East.

The US aggressor troops must immediately get out of our country's territory with all the murderous weapons they have illegally transported into our country's territory!

The day when all the people of North and South Korea share a happy life on the land of a unified motherland will surely come!

### 美国军队必须立即撤出南朝鲜

    美国军队必须立即撤出南朝鲜
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长　韩雪野
    今年2月举行的亚非人民团结理事会和4月在华沙举行的世界工联执行委员会第十九次会议，分别决定今年6月25日为“使美军撤出南朝鲜斗争日”，号召各国和平团体和工人团体展开国际运动要求美军立即从南朝鲜撤走。最近，世界和平理事会特别会议，又在“关于亚非当前局势的建议”中再一次强调，美帝国主义军队应该立即从南朝鲜撤走。
    这样，全世界爱好和平的人民就再一次表示了对为世界持久和平和祖国和平统一而斗争的全体朝鲜人民的一致支持。
    被这种支持所鼓舞的全体朝鲜人民，在争取世界持久和平和祖国和平统一的强有力的斗争中迎接“6月25日”——美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争的那一天的到来。
    朝鲜人民自从解放以来，一直在为祖国的和平统一而进行坚强斗争。
    1958年2月5日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于使一切外国军队从朝鲜撤走而实现朝鲜和平统一的声明，对于这个斗争具有十分重大的意义。这个声明提出了在目前局势下为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟道路的最公正合理的方案。因此，这个声明得到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的全力支持。
    中华人民共和国政府对我国政府的建议首先表示赞同。中国人民志愿军首先主动地全部撤出了北朝鲜。他们的行动为和平解决朝鲜问题打开了新的局面。在这种情况下，我国政府在去年10月28日再一次发表声明，主张美国侵略军应立即从南朝鲜撤走。但是美帝国主义侵略者却仍然想继续赖在南朝鲜。
    美军粗暴地违反朝鲜停战协定条款，疯狂地增强军备；并且为了加剧朝鲜的紧张局势，而恬不知耻地肆行狂妄的军事挑衅行动。为了把南朝鲜转变为威胁远东和亚洲和平的原子战争基地，美帝国主义者早在1957年7月把联合国军司令部迁移到汉城，并把原驻日本的美军第一装甲师调进南朝鲜来增强美军的军事力量，同时他们还把李承晚傀儡军从停战时的十六个师扩充为三十一个师。他们又片面地宣布废除朝鲜停战协定中关于禁止运入军事物资的第十三款卯项，并由去年开始运进南朝鲜280厘米原子炮、“诚实的约翰”火箭炮、“斗牛士”式导弹等各种新式武器，来改编驻南朝鲜美军为原子师。同时，他们还在军事分界线一带举行所谓“韩美联合”的大规模“原子机动演习”。
    美帝国主义的这些行动证明它反对和平而准备战争；反对朝鲜统一而想保持其永久的分裂，并企图永远保持它在南朝鲜的殖民统治。
    自美军霸占南朝鲜的那一天起，美帝国主义者就对南朝鲜施行暴虐的殖民地统治。由于美国的殖民地掠夺政策和军事化政策以及李承晚匪帮的暴政，南朝鲜工业一落千丈。目前在南朝鲜原由日本帝国主义者留下的本来就少得可怜的厂矿，几乎都已支离破碎，剩下的只有一些手工业式的中小企业，连它们也在美国垄断资本家和为数不多的买办资本家的压迫下，遭受着严重的原料荒、动力荒和资金荒。其中有80％以上已被迫停工或缩短生产时间。
    农村经济的情况也是如此。播种面积比日本统治时期减少六十万町步左右，粮食总产量，即使在年景最好的去年，也只等于日本统治时期的70％左右。
    南朝鲜农村经济已经雕敝不堪，农民遭受闻所未闻的残酷掠夺。
    南朝鲜现在有六百六十万失业者和半失业者大军徬徨街头，有数百万断粮农民挨饿。这说明南朝鲜经济已走到了破产的边缘。
    在美帝国主义者的指使下，李承晚不但把南朝鲜的富源整个地出卖给美国主子，使南朝鲜同胞陷于水深火热的活地狱中，现在甚至还想把衣食无着的同胞当作奴隶卖给外国。
    在美国主子指使下，李承晚匪帮正在所谓“移民”的借口下，把南朝鲜的失业者、贫苦农民，以及在上次战争中被敌人劫走的朝鲜北部居民和从李承晚军队中复员了的青壮年大批地运到国外去。
    今年5月11日，李承晚匪帮公布了“海外移民委员会法令”，准备大肆实行其罪恶的“移民”计划。
    有鉴于此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在今年5月22日再一次发表声明，谴责李承晚匪帮的罪恶阴谋，并强硬要求把美李匪帮要强制押到外国去的我国同胞全部移交到共和国北部来。
    同南朝鲜的悲惨情况形成强烈对照的是，朝鲜北部的人民正在祖国的社会主义建设中取得巨大的成就，并过着日益改善的幸福生活。
    本来经济十分落后的我国，现在已经变成了具有独立的民族经济巩固基础的工业—农业国了。
    1958年，我国工业品产量等于战前1949年的四倍。我国全体劳动人民已出色地完成今年第一季度生产计划，工业总产值比去年同时期增加了80％。这样，我国人民已经完成了第一个五年计划指标的87％。
    充满着爱国热情的我国劳动人民，决心提前两年在今年内超额完成第一个五年计划。
    我国农民大搞农村水利化，而使农村有了巨大转变。我国农业的机械化、电气化工作也已取得了显著的成果。从去年9月以来，已在我国农村里建立了许多水库、抽水站和其它农业工程。在这个短短的期间内所增加的灌溉面积，几乎等于日本统治的整个时期内所增加的灌溉面积的三倍以上。
    共和国北半部的人民热烈地希望同南半部人民一起享受自己的劳动果实，并且作好一切准备来迎接今天还在灾难中苟延残喘的南朝鲜失业者，背井离乡的农民、战时孤儿，使他们得到安定生活的保障。
    共和国北半部人民同时也作好一切准备迎接在日本遭受痛苦和灾难的我国同胞，让他们回国来过幸福的新生活。
    但是，美李匪帮不但阻挠旅日侨胞的归国，而且还在策划着强迫国内同胞也押到外国去。
    南朝鲜同胞所遭受的这一切灾难和痛苦的根源，就是美帝国主义者强占南朝鲜。
    假如，美国侵略军没有霸占南朝鲜，朝鲜人民早就会把自己的祖国和平统一起来，南北朝鲜的人民也就会一起和睦地过幸福富裕的生活了。
    朝鲜是属于朝鲜人民的。
    朝鲜问题，应该由朝鲜人自己来和平解决。
    美国侵略者不管用什么手段，也决不能为他们侵占南朝鲜找到合法的根据。
    美帝国主义军队必须立即从南朝鲜撤出去！
    这是对于朝鲜和平和远东和平有所关心的一切国家爱好和平人民的一致要求和主张。
    美国侵略军必须立即带着他们非法运进我国疆土的所有杀人武器从我国疆土滚出去！
    南北朝鲜的全体人民，在统一了的祖国土地上共享幸福生活的日子，是一定会到来的！
