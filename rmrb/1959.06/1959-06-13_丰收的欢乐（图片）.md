　　Harvest Joy
　　On the evening of May 30th, the male and female members of the Dengta Management Area of the Shiyang Commune in Huayang County, Sichuan Plain, finished dinner before dark and changed into new clothes to happily participate in the "Small Spring Harvest Evening Party" held by the management area to celebrate the first summer bumper harvest after the communization.
　　This year, the 1,180 mu of wheat in this management area achieved a yield of 500 jin per mu, an increase of 30% compared to last year; the unit yield of 580 mu of rapeseed also nearly doubled compared to last year; a unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved in summer.
　　Today, the threshing floor was swept extra clean, with four large drying mats spread in the center, and the tallest rapeseed and long-eared wheat lined up on both sides. This is the stage with rural flavor. The wonderful program began to perform. The girls danced gracefully, performing the life of silkworm picking.
　　The 77-year-old man, Hong Xueqin, loves the commune as his home, and this year's small spring harvest makes him particularly happy. You see, he and several girls are attracted by the program on the stage.
　　Our reporters Chen Jie and You Yungu photographed this.

    丰收的欢乐
    5月30日的傍晚，川西平原华阳县石羊公社灯塔管理区的男女社员，当天还没黑尽，都吃罢晚饭，换上新装，欢欢喜喜地去参加管理区举办的“小春丰收晚会”，庆祝公社化后第一个夏季大丰收。
    今年这个管理区一千一百八十亩小麦亩产达到五百斤，比去年增产30％；五百八十亩油菜的单位产量也比去年将近翻一番；夏季获得了空前的大丰收。
    打麦场上今天打扫得分外干净，四床大晒席铺在正中，长得最高的油菜和长穗小麦分列在两旁。这就是乡村风味的舞台。精彩的节目开始表演了。姑娘婆娑起舞，表演采桑的生活。
    七十七岁的老大爷洪学勤爱社如家，今年小春大丰收更使他特别高兴。你看他和几个姑娘都被舞台上的节目给吸引住了。
