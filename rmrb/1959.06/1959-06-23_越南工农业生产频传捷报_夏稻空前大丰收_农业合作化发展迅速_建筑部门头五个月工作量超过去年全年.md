Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to reports in local newspapers, the Northern Vietnamese plains have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer rice this year. Preliminary statistics from the Central Bureau of Statistics of the Vietnam State Planning Commission indicate that the average yield of summer rice per hectare (one hectare equals fifteen *mu*) in the provinces, cities, and districts of North Vietnam reached 2,087 kilograms. This figure is 281 kilograms more than the average yield per unit area of 1,806 kilograms in 1956 (the highest unit area yield after the restoration of peace). Compared to the highest unit area yield during the French occupation in 1939 (an average of over 1,200 kilograms per hectare), this represents an increase of approximately 850 kilograms, or about 70%.

Apart from Haiphong City, which averaged 2,731 kilograms per hectare, Thai Binh Province, the largest summer rice planting area in North Vietnam, harvested an average of 2,613 kilograms of summer rice per hectare.

The provinces, districts, and cities that exceeded the original planned targets for summer rice production this year include: Hong Quang Zone (30.9% above target), Haiphong (12.8% above target), Bac Giang (10.8% above target), Thai Binh (8.8% above target), Son Tay (7% above target), Kien An (4.1% above target), Hanoi (1.2% above target), and Phu Tho (0.6% above target).

Currently, the summer rice harvest has been completed in seventeen provinces in the North Vietnamese plains, as well as in Hanoi, Haiphong, Hong Quang Zone, Vinh Linh Zone, and other areas. Harvesting is underway in mountainous provinces and districts.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 22nd: Newspaper reports: As of the end of May, there were 15,026 agricultural production cooperatives in North Vietnam, with member households accounting for 19.6% of the total number of farm households. This is an increase of over 1,600 agricultural production cooperatives compared to the end of April and the beginning of May this year.

Currently, the provinces of North Vietnam are combining autumn rice production work with the further development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. Many localities are guiding agricultural cooperatives to summarize summer rice production, learn from experiences and lessons, thereby enhancing the socialist consciousness of cooperative members and improving the level of agricultural cooperative management, and vigorously promoting autumn rice production. Many provinces have also established training classes to cultivate management and technical cadres for agricultural cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 20th: According to local newspaper reports today: A communiqué issued on June 16th by the Finance and Economics Office of the Vietnamese Prime Minister's Office, regarding the basic construction situation in Vietnam in the first five months of 1959, pointed out that North Vietnam's basic construction had made great progress in the first five months of this year. The workload of the construction sector in the first five months exceeded the workload of the entire year of 1958. In April and May, the workload completed by various construction sites and construction companies under the Ministry of Construction reached 68% of the planned targets for the second quarter.

The communiqué stated that, by the end of May, the construction engineering departments had completed or substantially completed the construction work of ten factories and twelve other buildings. These factories include the Hanoi Cigarette Factory, the Hanoi Rubber Factory, the Haiphong Enamel Factory, the Viet Tri Sawmill, and the Lao Cai Power Plant, among others. Mass buildings include workers' housing, construction schools, sports schools, medical cadre schools, the Nguyen Ai Quoc Party School, and hospitals.

The communiqué said that in the first two months of the second quarter, greater achievements were made in timber harvesting, sand and gravel mining, brick and tile production, and material transportation compared to the first quarter.

The communiqué said that the organization and management of construction sites have been further strengthened. People's Army soldiers and workers at many construction sites have been able to actively overcome difficulties and work selflessly to complete their tasks. Therefore, the construction progress of many sites has accelerated.

The communiqué concluded by pointing out that, in order to further accelerate the construction speed of various projects in the future, relevant parties must approve the construction plans for various cities as early as possible and continue to actively prepare for the implementation of the basic construction plan for 1960.

    越南工农业生产频传捷报
    夏稻空前大丰收　农业合作化发展迅速
    建筑部门头五个月工作量超过去年全年
    据新华社河内讯　据此间报纸报道，越南北方平原地区今年夏稻获得空前大丰收。根据越南国家计划委员会中央统计局的初步统计，北越平原各省、市、区今年夏稻每公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）的平均产量达到二千零八十七公斤，这个数字比1956年夏稻单位面积的平均产量一千八百零六公斤（和平恢复后的最高单位面积产量）还多二百八十一公斤；同法国占领时期夏稻产量最高的1939年的单位面积产量（平均每公顷一千二百多公斤）相比，增加了八百五十公斤左右，即增加70％左右。
    除了海防市平均每公顷收获二千七百三十一公斤之外，在北越夏稻播种面积最大的太平省，今年在每公顷土地上平均收获夏稻二千六百一十三公斤。
    今年夏稻产量超过原计划指标的省、区、市有：鸿广区（超额30.9％）、海防（超额12.8％）、北江（超额10.8％）、太平（超额8.8％）、山西（超额7％）、建安（超额4.1％）、河内（超额1.2％）和富寿（超额0.6％）。
    目前，北越平原的十七个省和河内、海防、鸿广区、永灵区等地的夏稻已经收割完毕。山区各省、区正在收割中。
    新华社河内22日电　报纸消息：截至5月底为止的统计，全越南北方已经有一万五千零二十六个农业生产合作社，入社农户占农户总数的19.6％。比今年4月底、5月初时增加了一千六百多个农业生产合作社。
    目前，北越各省正在把秋稻生产工作与进一步发展和巩固农业合作社的工作结合起来。许多地方正在指导农业社总结夏稻生产，吸取经验教训，借以提高社员们的社会主义觉悟和管理农业社的水平，大力促进秋稻生产。许多省还成立了一批培养农业社的管理干部和技术干部的训练班。
    新华社河内20日电　据此间报纸今天报道：越南总理府财经办公室16日发表的关于越南1959年头五个月基本建设情况的公报指出，今年头五个月北越的基本建设有了很大的进展。建筑部门头五个月的工作量，就超过了1958年全年的工作量。在4月和5月份，建筑部所属各个工地和建筑公司所完成的工作量，达到了第二季度计划指标的68％。
    公报说，到5月底为止，建筑工程部门已经完成或基本完成了十个工厂和十二个其他建筑物的建筑工作。这些工厂包括河内卷烟厂、河内橡胶厂、海防搪瓷厂、越池锯木厂、老街电力厂等。群众建筑物包括劳动人民住宅、建筑学校、体育学校、医务干部学校、阮爱国党校和医院等。
    公报说，在今年第二季度的头两个月中，采伐木材、开采砂石、生产砖瓦以及材料调运工作等方面，都比第一季度获得了更大的成绩。
    公报说，建筑工地上的组织和管理工作已经有了进一步的加强。许多工地上的人民军战士和职工们都能积极克服困难，为完成自己的任务而忘我劳动。因此，很多工地的建设进度日益加快。
    公报最后指出，今后为了进一步加快各项工程的建设速度，有关方面必须提早通过各个城市的建设规划，继续为实现1960年的基本建设计划进行积极准备。
