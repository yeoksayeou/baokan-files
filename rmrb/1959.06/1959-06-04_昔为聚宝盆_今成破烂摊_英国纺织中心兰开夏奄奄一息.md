　　Formerly a Treasure Trove, Now a Shambles
　　Lancashire, the British Textile Center, is Dying

　　(Our dispatch) London News: The British Lancashire cotton textile industry, which dominated the world as the "Cotton King" more than forty years ago, is currently struggling in an ever-deepening crisis.

　　There is a British proverb that says, "Britain's bread hangs on Lancashire's spinning threads." However, due to a long period of "recession," this important industrial sector, which "Britain's bread" hangs on, has now had to greatly reduce its production scale in order to survive.

　　Last Year was Terrible, This Year is Worse

　　1958 was a particularly difficult year for Lancashire. Some textile factory owners described the year as one in which they "never lost so much in such a short period of time." In that year, British cotton textile production fell by 14%, single yarn production was only 66% of that in 1951, and cotton cloth production was only 71% of the average annual production from 1950-53. Since the end of World War II, British cotton textile production has been shrinking, and production in 1958 reached its lowest point. In that year, cotton cloth production was only 1.429 billion square yards, just over one-sixth of Britain's annual cotton cloth production before 1914, when Lancashire produced 8 billion square yards of cotton cloth annually.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the decline in British cotton textile production has further increased. In the first quarter of this year, cotton textile production fell by 19% compared to the same period last year, with declines of about 18% in January and February, and 21% in March. Due to the shrinking production, 400 textile factories in Britain have closed down since 1955. In 1958, an average of two textile factories closed down every week. In 1959, the number of cotton spindles and looms in Britain shrank by more than 40% compared to 1939.

　　From 1951 to 1958, the number of textile workers decreased by 110,000, or one-third. In 1958 alone, the number of textile workers decreased by more than 33,000. At the end of 1958, there were only 200,800 textile workers in Britain, while in 1912, there were 750,000 textile workers in Britain.

　　Market Shrinks, Production Plummets

　　The decline in British cotton textile production is mainly due to the shrinking of traditional markets. Lancashire prospered by relying on monopolizing huge domestic and foreign markets. This monopoly has become a thing of the past due to the development of national industries in many countries and the fierce competition from other capitalist countries. For example, in 1913, Britain exported seven-eighths of its cotton cloth production - 7 billion square yards. However, in 1958, Britain only exported 384 million square yards of cotton cloth, lower than the amount of cotton cloth it imported in the same year, which was a first in Britain's 200-year history. In addition, due to the impact of the economic crisis, the domestic market for British cotton textiles has also greatly shrunk.

　　Government Plan to Cut Feet to Fit Shoes

　　In order to "rescue" the crisis in the cotton textile industry, the British House of Commons has decided to begin discussing a so-called "restructuring" "five-year plan" for the cotton textile industry on June 4. The core of this plan is to reduce the "excess" production capacity of the cotton textile industry, that is, to use government subsidies (30 million pounds over five years) to "subsidize" capitalists to close down a large number of factories and lay off a large number of workers, making the textile industry more "concentrated." Under these conditions, some equipment will be updated to give Lancashire "competitive ability."

　　According to a white paper published by the British government in mid-May, under this "restructuring" plan, within five years, the number of cotton spindles in Britain will be reduced by half, or 12 million; doubling spindles will be reduced by 60%, or 1.2 million; at least 70,000 looms will be reduced; the production capacity of the finishing department will be reduced by 25% to 40%; and the production capacity of the waste spinning department will be reduced by 10%, and so on. Wilson, the Labor Party's economic affairs spokesperson, called the "assistance" that the British government intends to give the British textile industry "burial fees for several important factories in the British textile industry." He said that the government intends to let the textile industry "die bankrupt and bleeding."

### 昔为聚宝盆　今成破烂摊  英国纺织中心兰开夏奄奄一息

    昔为聚宝盆　今成破烂摊
    英国纺织中心兰开夏奄奄一息
    本报讯　伦敦消息：四十多年以前以“棉布大王”称雄于世界的英国兰开夏棉纺织业，目前正在愈陷愈深的危机之中进行挣扎。
    英国有一句谚语说：“英国的面包挂在兰开夏的纺线上”。但是，由于长期的“不景气”，这个挂着
  “英国的面包”的重要的工业部门现在已经不得不大大缩小生产规模以苟延残喘。
    去年奇惨今年更糟
    1958年是兰开夏度过的一个特别困难的年头，一些纺织厂主形容这一年说，他们“从来没有在这样短的时间中亏损得这样多”。在这一年中，英国棉纺织品的产量下降了14％，单股纱的产量仅及1951年的66％，棉布的产量仅及1950—53年平均年产量的71％。第二次世界大战结束以来，英国棉纺织品的产量一直在萎缩，1958年的产量达到了最低点。这一年棉布的产量只有十四亿二千九百万平方码，仅及英国1914年以前棉布年产量的六分之一多一点，当时兰开夏每年生产八十亿平方码棉布。
    今年以来，英国棉纺织品产量下降的幅度更加增大。在今年第一季度中，棉纺织品的产量比去年同期下降了19％，其中，1、2月份下降约18％，3月份下降了21％。由于生产萎缩，自从1955年以来英国已经有四百家纺织工厂倒闭。1958年平均每星期有两家纺织工厂倒闭。1959年英国的棉纺锭和织机的数目比1939年萎缩了40％以上。
    从1951年到1958年，纺织工人减少了十一万人，即减少了三分之一，仅仅在1958年一年中，纺织工人就减少了三万三千人以上。1958年底，英国只有二十万零八千个纺织工人，而在1912年，英国有七十五万纺织工人。
    市场缩小产量剧降
    英国棉纺织品产量的下降，主要是由于传统市场的缩小。兰开夏是依靠垄断庞大的国内外市场而繁荣起来的，这种垄断的局面由于许多国家民族工业的发展和其他资本主义国家的激烈竞争已经成为过去了。例如：在1913年，英国输出了它生产的棉布的八分之七——七十亿平方码。但是，在1958年，英国只出口三亿八千四百万平方码棉布，低于它同年进口的棉布数量，这在英国二百年来的历史上还是第一次。此外，由于经济危机的影响，英国棉纺织品的国内市场也大大缩小了。
  政府计划削足就履
    为了“解救”棉纺织业的危机。英国下院已经决定在6月4日开始讨论一项政府提出的所谓“改组”棉纺织业的“五年计划”。这项计划的中心就是缩减棉纺织业的“过剩”的生产能力，即用政府贴钱的办法（五年中拿出三千万英镑）“津贴”资本家关闭大批工厂，解雇大批工人，使纺织工业变得更加“集中”，在这样条件下更新一部分设备，使兰开夏具有“竞争能力”。
    根据英国政府在5月中旬所发表的一份白皮书，按照这项“改组”计划，在五年内，英国的棉纺锭将比现在减少一半，即减少一千二百万枚；并线锭将减少60％，即减少一百二十万枚；织机至少将减少七万架；整理部门的生产能力将缩减25％至40％，废纺部门的生产能力将减少10％，等等。英国工党经济问题发言人威尔逊把英国政府打算给予英国纺织工业的这种“援助”叫做“给予英国纺织工业若干重要工厂的安葬费”。他说，政府打算让纺织工业“破产流血而死”。
