    This Trend Must Not Continue
    Recently, the People's Daily, Liberation Daily, Wenhui Daily, and Guangming Daily have been discussing Cao Cao extensively, which has enlivened the academic atmosphere. This should be considered a good thing. However, I have a view that when using historical materialism to evaluate historical figures, there must be a clear purpose. Generally speaking, there are two situations:
    Firstly, through the evaluation of historical figures, to further understand the situation of the productive forces and relations of production at that time. This is originally very meaningful, but this matter can be done by relevant researchers, who can argue on academic platforms and in professional journals. For discussions on individual historical figures with greater influence, newspapers can also make some comprehensive reports and evaluations in a timely manner.
    Secondly, to expand the influence of the evaluation to the masses. If a historical figure has merits worthy of everyone's learning, we have a responsibility to promote them. It is also possible that he is a negative example, and in certain situations, it is also worth drawing lessons from as a warning.
    Although Cao Cao has a relatively large influence among the masses, the comments on him should not exceed the first situation mentioned above. The fact that various newspapers publish relevant articles on full pages clearly treats the evaluation of Cao Cao as the second situation. Recently, some newspapers have also discussed King Zhou of Yin at great length. I believe that the trend of discussing historical figures at length in newspapers must not continue. When discussing historical figures at length, it must be for the purpose of serving the present.

    此风不可长
    最近，人民日报、解放日报、文汇报和光明日报大谈曹操，活跃了学术空气，这应该说是一件好事。但我有一种看法，就是用历史唯物主义的观点来评价历史人物时必须有一个明确的目的。一般说来，有如下两种情况：
    其一是通过对历史人物的评价，进一步了解当时生产力与生产关系的情况。这原是很有意义的，但这件事可由有关的研究人员来做，由他们在学术讲坛和专业刊物上争鸣。对个别影响较大的历史人物的讨论，报纸也可适时地作一些综合性的报道和评价。
    其二是把评价的影响扩大到群众中去。某一个历史人物有值得大家学习的优点，我们有责任为他发扬。也有可能他是反面教员，在一定情况下也值得大家引为警惕。
    曹操在群众中尽管有较大影响，但对他的评论不宜超过上述的第一种情况。各报以整版篇幅刊载有关文章，显然把对曹操的评价作为上述的第二种情况来处理了。有的报纸最近又以很大篇幅谈殷纣王。我以为在报纸上大谈历史人物之风不可长。大谈历史人物，必须古为今用。　　上海　沈隆文
