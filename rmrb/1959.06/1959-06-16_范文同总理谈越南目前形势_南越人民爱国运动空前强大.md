Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 15th: Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that the South Vietnamese people's struggle against the American intervention policy that violates the Geneva Accords, their demand for improved living standards, their demand for democracy, freedom, and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland is unprecedentedly strong.

Pham Van Dong made these remarks on May 29th in response to some questions posed to him by Iraqi writer and journalist Farman. Hanoi newspapers published Pham Van Dong's remarks today.

Premier Pham Van Dong said that facing this situation, the American interventionists and the South Vietnamese authorities have taken a series of extremely barbaric measures in an attempt to suppress the patriotic movement of the South Vietnamese people. He listed atrocities committed by the US-Ngo clique, such as the Phu Loi massacre and the launching of military "sweeps." He said that the US-Ngo clique has openly violated the Geneva Accords, seriously threatening the peaceful lives of South Vietnamese residents, and at the same time seriously endangering the peace of Vietnam, Indochina, and Southeast Asia.

Pham Van Dong emphasized that the US-Ngo clique's extremely brutal behavior has been met with strong opposition from the Vietnamese people and condemnation from world public opinion. With the firm support of the people of the world, the Vietnamese people will wage a difficult but inevitably victorious struggle against the US-Ngo clique in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

Premier Pham Van Dong told Farman, "We very much hope to enhance the friendly relations between (Vietnam and Iraq)." He said, "Vietnam and Iraq, through economic and cultural exchanges, will further consolidate and strengthen the relations between the two countries and contribute to the cause of defending world peace."

    南越人民爱国运动空前强大
    新华社河内15日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同指出，南越人民反对违反日内瓦协议的美国干涉政策、要求改善生活水平、要求民主自由和祖国和平统一的斗争运动，空前强大。
    范文同是在5月29日回答伊拉克作家和记者法尔曼向他提出的一些问题时说这番话的。河内各报今天登载了范文同的谈话。
    范文同总理说，面临着这种情况，美国干涉者和南越当局采取了一系列极端野蛮的措施，企图镇压南越人民的爱国运动。他列举了美吴集团制造富利惨案、发动军事扫荡等暴行。他说，美吴集团已经公开破坏日内瓦协议，严重威胁南越居民的和平生活，同时严重危害越南、印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    范文同强调说，美吴集团的极端残暴的行为遭到了越南人民的强烈反对和世界舆论的谴责。越南人民在世界人民的坚决支持下，将对美吴集团进行艰苦但必然会胜利的斗争，以取得祖国的和平统一。
    范文同总理对法尔曼说：“我们非常希望增强（越南和伊拉克）两国之间的友好关系”他说：“越南和伊拉克通过经济和文化交流，将会进一步巩固和加强两国之间的关系，对保卫世界和平事业作出贡献。”
