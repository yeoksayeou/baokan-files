	Walking into the workshop of Chongqing Air Compressor Factory, I couldn't help but feel a sense of freshness and pleasure. Rows of neat machine tools, all wiped clean and shiny, with not a trace of grease, spotless to the touch. Every corner of the workshop was as clean as a hospital, and all kinds of work materials were stacked neatly. During the commute, I saw a touching scene: each machine tool worker, as if doing a major cleaning, meticulously wiped and cleaned their machine tool, clearly completed the handover procedures, and then left the workshop...

	These snippets made me feel that this factory had achieved civilized production.

	In the third workshop, the chairman of the labor union accompanied me to a large machine tool several meters long. Several young men were gathered around, watching an old master, dressed in a snow-white shirt, focused on his work. Two red triangular flags, emblazoned with the words "Excellent Maintenance," fluttered on this brand-new, silver-gray machine tool. Next to the machine tool were colorful "Cleanest" markings, along with maintenance excellence announcements, congratulatory letters, and certificates. The labor union chairman quietly told me: This is Master Luo Xingyang, a model worker in equipment maintenance who has had no accidents for five years.

	After working for a while, Master Luo suddenly looked up, pointed to the shiny surface of the bed, and said to the young men, "Be especially careful in maintaining the bed surface. If iron filings or grit get stuck on it, dragging the workpiece across will cause grooves, affecting the machine tool's precision."

	"Master, where should this tool be placed?" an apprentice suddenly asked.

	"Hang it properly in the tool cabinet." Master Luo said, while watching the apprentice hang the tool. He suddenly noticed that the wire tying the tool was too thin, and he showed dissatisfaction, saying, "How can such a thin wire hold such a heavy thing! If it falls and damages the tool's teeth, it will cause problems when working!" Saying that, Master Luo personally added two strands of wire.

	Taking advantage of Master Luo's free time, the labor union chairman gave me an introduction.

	"I heard that you haven't had an accident for five years, which is not easy." I talked with Master Luo next to the machine tool.

	"Actually, there's no secret to it." Master Luo said cheerfully, "I just truly treat this property entrusted to me by the country as my own eyes, wiping it, oiling it, carefully inspecting it, and operating it every day. Over time, it becomes second nature. If I don't do these things for a day, I feel uncomfortable."

	"Look, how long has this machine tool been in use?" Master Luo suddenly asked me.

	"It's brand new, probably not long."

	"It's been in my hands for five or six years." Master Luo continued with a smile, "Machines are really a bit like people. If you take good care of them, they won't get sick or throw tantrums, and they'll obediently work for you. However, this is a very delicate maintenance job. ......"

	From the two small things I just saw Master Luo teaching the young workers, and from Master Luo's brief conversation, I felt that it was no accident that this old master had no accidents for five years. He must have put a lot of effort into the maintenance of the equipment.

	When I walked into the fourth workshop, I saw two doggerel verses posted on the wall. These two poems illustrate the different situations of equipment maintenance in this section in the past and now:

	The first poem is: Fifth section came, very bad, equipment accidents were really not few,
		Dust and oil mud filled the machine tool, iron filings filled the ground and were not swept.

	The second poem is: Fifth section came, really great, equipment accidents were eliminated early,
		The machine is dark and clean, a white cloth wipe can not blacken.

	Zhong Longxing, the Party group leader of the fifth section of the fourth workshop, told me that these two doggerel verses were written and sent to them by workers from other sections of the workshop.

	While leading me to visit their section, Zhong Longxing pointed to rows of machine tools and said, "You see, almost all of the more than thirty machine tools in our section are old machines that have been used for many years. Our section was also newly established last year, and the people were all gathered from various workshops, and most of them were new apprentices. In the past, we always emphasized these objective and difficult conditions. At that time, others said that we were the section with the worst equipment maintenance in the factory, and we were still a little unconvinced in our hearts!"

	"However, the comrades' criticisms and accusations have become an important driving force for us to do a good job in maintenance." Zhong Longxing continued, "From that time on, the Party group carried out in-depth ideological mobilization work among every worker. When everyone in the entire section's thoughts were valued, and they treated the machine as their most beloved treasure to maintain, and eliminated accidents as the most hateful enemy, miracles appeared. From December of last year to now, all thirty-odd machine tools and more than one hundred workers in our entire section have eliminated accidents. Our worst section has also become the earliest section in the factory to eliminate accidents and the best in maintenance."

	Zhong Longxing finally told me excitedly that the workers in this section recently proposed a goal: to maintain the machines more carefully and ensure no accidents for three years!

	When visiting the stamping section of the sixth workshop, I saw that each towering punch press had a red flag of "Excellent Maintenance" inserted at the top; next to each punch press, there was a small wooden sign with a name written on it. Mechanical and electrical personnel introduced the origin of these red flags and wooden signs to me.

	It turned out that next to this section was a sandblasting section. Ash and sand invaded the section's machine tools every day, and the workers were racking their brains. They said that our cleaning and maintenance here just can't be done well. To do it well, unless the sandblasting section is driven away. However, technical safety maintenance worker Master Jiang Chenghua did not think so. He silently washed and scrubbed the bed several times a day, and taught the apprentice on his machine to wash and scrub diligently. As a result, his machine tool was always clean and bright, and was always rated as excellent in maintenance. He also personally went to help his neighbors wash and scrub diligently, and those beds quickly became excellent in maintenance as well. The facts convinced people that now, the beds in the entire stamping section have won the red flag of excellent maintenance.

	Master Jiang thought of many ways to maintain the bed and eliminate accidents. Hanging nameplates on each bed was one of the methods. In the past, the users of the machine tools were not fixed, no one was responsible for the maintenance work, the machines often had problems, which affected production. Later, technical safety maintenance worker Master Jiang proposed a method of fixing the machine, fixing the person, and fixing the responsibility. Each bed was responsible for the technical safety maintenance work by a master, and his nameplate was hung out to carry out mutual competition. Since then, accidents in the entire section have been greatly reduced.

	It is understood that there are more than two hundred outstanding technical safety maintenance workers like Master Jiang in the factory. They have become the backbone force leading the masses to do a good job in the factory's equipment maintenance.

	In this factory, everyone participated in the competition for excellent standards of equipment maintenance, and everyone did their best to maintain their own machines. In this way, this large factory achieved excellent results in basically eliminating equipment accidents in May.

    精心维护设备的人们
    本报记者  胡明俊
    走进重庆空气压缩机厂的车间，我不禁产生了一种清爽愉快的感觉。一排排整齐的机床，全擦得油光水滑的，见不到一点油垢，用手摸摸，一尘不染。车间的每个角落，都打扫得像医院一样，各种各样的活计，都堆放得整整齐齐的。在上下班的时候，我看到一种动人的场面：每个机床的工人都像做大扫除一样，把自己的机床细致地擦洗了又擦洗，把交接手续弄得清清楚楚，然后才离开车间……
    这些片断的情景，使我感觉到：这个厂做到了文明生产。
    在第三车间，工会主席陪我走到一部几公尺长的大机床旁边，几个青年小伙子正围着看一个穿着雪白衬衣专心做活的老师傅。这部崭新的银灰色机床上，飘扬着两面嵌上“维护保养优等”字样的红色三角旗，车床旁边，贴着“最清洁”的彩色标记，和维护优等的喜报、贺信、奖状。工会主席悄悄告诉我：这位就是五年不出事故的设备维护标兵罗兴扬师傅。
    罗师傅做了一会，忽然抬起头来，指着光可鉴人的床面对小伙子们说：“要特别小心维护床面，要是上边有点铁屑、灰沙卡住，活拉过去，就会起槽子，影响机床精度。”
    “师傅，这工具放在哪儿？”一个学徒突然走来问道。
    “好好挂在工具柜里。”罗师傅边说，边去看学徒挂工具。他忽然发现拴着工具的铁丝太细，便显出不满意的神情说：“这么细的铁丝吊这么重的家伙，怎么行哪！要是掉下来，把工具的牙齿打落，做起活来不要出毛病！”说着，罗师傅亲自加上了两股铁丝。
    趁着罗师傅有空的时刻，工会主席便给我作了介绍。
    “听说你五年不出事故，可不容易。”我和罗师傅就在机床旁边谈起来。
    “其实，这里头没啥秘密。”罗师傅爽朗地笑道：“我不过是把国家交给的这份财产，着实当做自己的眼珠来保护，天天替它擦洗、加油、细心检查、操作，日子久了，习惯成自然，要是一天不做这些事，心里就不舒服。”
    “你看，这部床子用了多久？”罗师傅突然问我。
    “崭新的，大概才用不久吧。”
    “它在我手上，就用了五、六年啦。”罗师傅笑着继续说：“机器真有点像人，你把它调护好，它一不生病，二不发脾气，乖乖地给你干活，不过，这是一个很细致的调护工作。………”
    从刚才看到罗师傅教训青工的两桩细小事情，从罗师傅简短的谈话，使我觉得：这位老师傅五年不出事故是决非偶然的，他对设备的维护保养不知花了多少心血。
    当我走进第四车间，就看到墙上贴着两首打油诗。这两首诗说明了这个工段过去和现在的设备维护保养工作的不同情况：
    头一首是：五工段来很糟糕，设备事故真不少，
              灰尘油泥满机床，铁屑满地都不扫。
    第二首是：五工段来真了得，设备事故早消灭，
              机器乌亮地清洁，白布帕儿擦不黑。
    第四车间五工段的党小组长钟隆兴告诉我，这两首打油诗都是车间其他工段的工人写来送给他们的。
    钟隆兴一边领我参观他们的工段，一边指着一排排的机床说：“你瞧，我们工段的三十多部机床，差不多都是用了多年的老床子。我们工段又是去年刚成立，人都是从各个车间凑拢来的，大部分又是新学工。过去，我们总是强调这些客观困难条件。那时候，别人说我们是全厂设备维护最糟的工段，我们心里还有些不服气哩！”
    “不过，同志们的指责批评，却成了推动我们作好维护工作的重要动力。”钟隆兴继续说：“从那时起，党小组在每个工人中间做了深入的思想发动工作。当全工段的每个人的思想都重视起来，把机器当作自己最心爱的宝贝来维护，把事故当作最可恶的敌人来歼灭的时候，奇迹便出现了。从去年12月份到现在，我们全段三十多部机床、一百多名工人全都消灭了事故，我们这个最糟糕的工段，也就变成了全厂消灭事故最早、维护保养最好的工段。”
    钟隆兴最后兴奋地告诉我，这个段的工人最近又提出一个奋斗目标：要更加精心维护机器，保证三年不出事故！
    在访问第六车间冲压工段的时候，我看见每部巍然耸立的冲床顶端，都插着一面“维护优等”的红旗；每部冲床子旁边，都挂着一个写上名字的小木牌。机电人员向我介绍了这些红旗和木牌的来历。
    原来，这个工段隔壁就是一个濆沙工段。灰沙天天侵袭工段的机床，工人们伤透了脑筋。他们说，我们这儿的清洁维护就是搞不好，要搞好，除非把濆沙段撵走。技术安全维护员蒋成华老师傅却不以为然。他不声不响，自己天天都要擦洗几次床子，并且教导他机床上的学徒也勤洗勤擦，结果，他那部机床总是干净透亮，每次都被评为维护优等。他又亲自去帮助左邻右舍勤洗勤擦，那些床子也很快变成了维护优等。事实说服了人们，现在，整个冲压工段的床子都得上了维护优等的红旗。
    对维护床子，消灭事故，蒋师傅想了许多办法，在每个床子上挂名牌，就是办法中的一个。过去，车床的使用人不固定，维护工作无人负责，机器常常出毛病，影响生产。后来，技术安全维护员蒋师傅提出了定机、定人、定责任的办法，每个床子都由一位师傅负责技术安全维护工作，并把他的名牌挂出来，互相开展竞赛。从这以后，全段的事故便大大减少了。
    据了解，像蒋师傅这样的优秀技术安全维护员，全厂有二百多个，他们已经成为带领群众做好全厂设备维护保养工作的骨干力量。
    在这个工厂里，人人都参加了设备维护保养优秀标准的竞赛，人人都尽心竭力地维护保养自己的机器，这样，就使这个大型工厂，在5月份出现了基本消灭设备事故的优异成绩。
