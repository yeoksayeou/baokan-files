Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 24th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force units stationed in the Guangzhou area are bravely fighting floods and providing disaster relief alongside the people of Guangdong Province.

Since mid-June, naval units stationed in the Guangzhou area have dispatched large numbers of ships and rubber boats to bravely rescue disaster-stricken people and materials in Zengcheng, Dongguan, and other areas surrounded by floods. On the 16th and 17th alone, four ships and twenty rubber boats rescued 1,650 disaster-stricken people, water buffalo, and materials such as cement in the Zengcheng area.

The air force units in the Guangzhou area have not only dispatched over 3,000 officers and soldiers to directly participate in the emergency rescue efforts in recent days, but have also organized an air-drop team to air-drop large quantities of food, bedding, medicine, and communication equipment to the people in the disaster-stricken areas of eastern Guangdong.

Army units in various places have undertaken important tasks in the emergency rescue and disaster relief efforts. On the 13th, when Huiyang, Boluo, and other places were hit by floods, the garrison immediately dispatched troops and thirty-six electric boats and rubber boats to participate in the rescue. Hu Jicheng, the commander of the garrison, personally led office cadres to the most dangerous and difficult sections of the dike to direct the dike protection and rescue operations, working for three consecutive days and nights without rest. The sixth squad of the guard company of the unit, led by commander Liu Xingxiang, guarded and rescued the dike, staying on the water for two consecutive days and nights. The soldiers' feet were swollen, and their hands were worn, but no one was willing to rest. When the flood rushed into Boluo street, Lieutenant Colonel Yang Haishui, a combat hero, immediately led his troops to fight the flood, putting forward the slogan: "We will not leave the dangerous area until every single person has left the dangerous area!" The officers and soldiers of the river-crossing company of the unit worked for six days and six nights without rest, rescuing more than 1,400 disaster victims and more than 450 tons of grain. On the 17th, the troops rescuing disaster victims in the Huiyang area rescued 12,000 disaster victims in one day and resettled 4,000 disaster victims. PLA troops in the Chaoshan area and Zhanjiang, Hepu, and other areas also bravely participated in the flood fighting and rescue operations.

When the troops stationed in Guangzhou and the surrounding areas heard that the West River and North River would have exceptionally large floods, they immediately sent flood control troops to the North River Dam to defend the North River Dam together with the people. After receiving the notification of the dangerous situation on the North River Dam, a unit, led by Deputy Captain Yang Yuchun, rushed forty miles in the heavy rain overnight to the dam and immediately joined the battle after putting down their backpacks.

The People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers' active participation in flood fighting and rescue operations deeply moved the people in the disaster areas. A letter jointly written by the Party branch and all the disaster-stricken people of the Xiayuan Brigade of the Pingtan Commune in Huiyang said: "...We have experienced the largest flood in history this time. Crops were submerged, houses collapsed, and we were trapped on two small hills, with external assistance cut off. Fortunately, the Party sent the air force to air-drop food for days, allowing us to survive in desperate situations. We are extremely grateful for the greatness of the Party, the great kindness of Chairman Mao, and the strong support of party and government organs at all levels. All the disaster-stricken members of our Xiayuan Brigade will repay the Party and Chairman Mao with practical actions in the future, guarantee to overcome all natural disasters with tenacious spirit, and actively carry out the current production work."

    广东地区陆海空三军奋勇抗洪救灾
    据新华社广州24日电　中国人民解放军驻广州地区陆、海、空三军部队，同广东省人民一起奋勇抗洪救灾。
    6月中旬以来，驻在广州地区的海军部队，先后派出了大批的舰艇、橡皮船，在遭受洪水包围的增城、东莞等地奋勇抢救受灾人民和物资。16、17日两天，四艘舰艇和二十只橡皮船，仅在增城一带就抢救出一千六百五十名受灾人民、水牛和水泥等物资。
    广州地区的空军部队，连日来除出动了三千多名官兵直接投入抢险斗争外，并组织了空投大队，空投大批粮食、被服、药品和通讯器材给广东东江受灾地区的人民。
    各地陆军部队在抢险救灾中担负了重要任务。13日，惠阳、博罗等地受到洪水的侵袭，驻军立即派出部队和三十六只电船、橡皮船参加抢救。驻军部队首长胡继成少将亲率机关干部到最危险最困难的堤段指挥护堤抢险，一连三天三夜不眠不息。该部警卫连六班十多名战士在指挥员刘兴祥带领下护堤抢险，连续两天一夜未离开水面，战士们脚泡肿了，手磨破了，没有一个人愿意休息。当洪水冲进博罗街内的时候，战斗英雄杨海水中校，立即带领部队与洪水展开了搏斗，他们提出口号：“一个群众不离开险区，我们就不离开险区！”该部渡河连的官兵，六天六夜不眠不息，抢救出一千四百多名灾民，四百五十多吨粮食。在惠阳地区救灾的部队在17日一天中，就抢救出一万二千名灾民，并将四千名灾民进行了安置。解放军部队在潮汕地区和湛江、合浦等地区，也奋勇参加了抗洪抢险斗争。
    驻在广州市和广州附近地区的部队，听到西江、北江将有特大洪峰到来的时候，随即派出防洪部队到北江大堤与人民群众一道坚守北江大堤。某部接到北江大堤的险情通知后，在副队长杨玉春率领下，连夜冒着大雨，急行军四十里赶到堤上，放下背包立即投入战斗。
    人民解放军官兵积极参加抗洪抢险的行动，深深感动了灾区群众。惠阳平潭公社下源大队党支部和全体受灾群众联名写的一封信中说：“……我们这次发生有史以来没有过的大水灾，庄稼被淹没，房屋倒塌，我们被水困在两个不大的山岗上，外援断绝，幸得党派了空军连日空投粮食，使我们在绝境中得到生活，万分感激党的伟大，毛主席的大恩，和各级党政机关大力支援。我们下源大队全体受灾社员今后决以实际行动来报答党和毛主席，保证以顽强精神，战胜一切自然灾害，积极搞好目前生产工作。”
