Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: The wheat harvest has begun in the suburbs of Beijing. Starting from the 10th, 120,000 workers, cadres, students, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army from the capital supporting the suburban wheat harvest have been heading to the rural areas, and a wheat-grabbing battle is about to enter its climax.

This year, 1.4 million mu of wheat was planted in the suburbs of Beijing, an increase of 200,000 mu compared to last year. Most wheat fields implemented yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, heavy fertilization, and rational close planting during sowing last autumn. They also fought a severe battle against drought during the wheat growing season. Therefore, except for some sandy, sloping, dry, and alkaline lands, the wheat in most fields is growing well.

Before the wheat harvest, reporters visited many wheat-producing areas and saw that many wheat plants were chest-high and the ears were over three inches long. However, among these heavy-eared and well-growing wheat fields, there were also some wheat plants that were short, with small ears, and growing poorly. These two completely different growth situations formed a sharp contrast. Their growth conditions and the reasons for them have become one of the most popular topics of discussion among the commune members, and people have received an excellent education in the discussions.

This year's wheat harvest task in the suburbs of Beijing is heavier than in previous years. Summer planting and vegetable marketing must also be carried out simultaneously, and the rural labor force is relatively tight. In order to ensure that the wheat harvest is timely and thoroughly harvested, various agencies, factories, schools, and the People's Liberation Army units stationed in Beijing have been promoting the fine tradition of supporting rural production. They have arranged their time and adjusted shifts to extract as much manpower as possible to support the suburban wheat harvest. More than 300 cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, led by General Yang Yong and General Lai Chuanzhu, went to Xiji People's Commune in Tongzhou District, the district with the most wheat planting, on the 11th to participate in the wheat harvest. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory has sent a team composed of veteran workers and technicians to help the commune assemble harvesting machinery. The workers left in the factory have also organized technical teams to use their holidays to assist the commune in repairing machinery. In addition to sending more than 90 staff members to participate in the wheat harvest, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences will also cooperate with the Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences to help the commune summarize high-yield experiences and conduct scientific research.

People's communes in the suburbs have drawn strong laborers to form professional wheat harvesting armies through a comprehensive arrangement of the labor force. The 290,000 pieces of small summer harvest tools and 140,000 reed mats prepared by the commercial departments for the suburbs have been transported to the using units. Combine harvesters and threshers have been sent to the fields.

In order to seize grain from the approaching rainy season, the people's communes paid special attention to rain prevention preparations. During the rush harvest, they will organize cooperation between slopes and depressions, dry land and water land, and teams with more wheat planting and teams with less wheat planting based on the principle of equal value and mutual benefit, so that one piece is ripe, one piece is harvested and one piece is threshed, striving for a bumper harvest. At present, there is still a shortage of rain protection tools, and the people's communes are trying to solve the problem.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: In the past two months, the suburbs of Beijing have been dry and lacking rain, and various diseases and insect pests have occurred continuously in crops. The Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a telephone conference, requesting all districts (counties) to immediately eliminate and treat areas where diseases and insect pests have occurred. Where there are no occurrences, they should also be vigilant and strive to eliminate diseases and insect pests in the early stages.

According to surveys by communes in various districts (counties) and the Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences, cotton aphids are currently the most harmful to field crops and are reproducing rapidly. A survey of the fourth station of Heping Commune in Chaoyang District from May 11 to 12 showed that seedlings with cotton aphids accounted for only 0.1% of the total number of cotton seedlings. By May 28, 27.2% of the cotton plants had aphids. Overwintering corn borers have begun to turn into moths, and taller corn has already been damaged. More serious diseases and insect pests in the vegetable area include cabbage caterpillars, cutworms, flea beetles, cucumber powdery mildew, and downy mildew.

After discovering the harm of diseases and insect pests, districts (counties) and communes have taken measures to organize commune members to capture and eliminate them. Twelve production teams of the Shahe Station of Xiaotangshan Commune have organized professional teams, and 1,800 mu of cotton fields have been treated once. In order not to delay the elimination and treatment, the municipal and district commercial departments have allocated a large number of medicines and machinery. The Municipal Production Materials Management Office has continuously allocated 850,000 jin of pesticides and some spraying equipment to relevant communes in the past ten days. (Attached picture)

### 京郊展开夺麦大战  十二万工人干部学生和驻军下乡

    京郊展开夺麦大战
    十二万工人干部学生和驻军下乡
    新华社11日讯　北京郊区小麦开始收割。首都支援郊区麦收的十二万工人、干部、学生和解放军官兵，从10日起陆续开赴郊区农村，一场夺麦大战即将进入高潮。
    北京郊区今年种有小麦一百四十万亩，比去年扩大二十万亩。大多数麦田在去秋播种时都实行了深翻、多肥和合理密植等增产措施，在小麦生长期间又和干旱进行了严重的斗争，因此除了部分沙、坡、旱、碱地以外，多数麦田的小麦生长良好。
    在麦收前夕，记者曾在许多产麦区进行了访问，看到很多小麦株高及胸，穗过三寸。但是，在这些麦穗沉甸、生长良好的麦田中间，也有一些长得矮、穗头小、生长不良的小麦。这两种生长情况完全不同的小麦，形成了鲜明的对比。它们的生长情况及其原因成了社员们目前最爱评论的问题之一，人们在评论中受到了极好的教育。
    今年北京郊区麦收任务比往年繁重，夏种、蔬菜上市又要同时进行，农村劳动力状况比较紧张。为了保证麦收及时而且收净，首都各机关、工厂、学校和人民解放军驻京部队发扬历来支援农村生产的优良传统，纷纷安排时间，调整班次，尽量抽出人力支援郊区麦收。中国人民解放军三百多名干部，11日在杨勇上将、赖传珠上将率领下，到种麦最多的通州区参加了西集人民公社的麦收工作。北京农业机械厂已派出由老工人和技术人员组成的小组，帮助公社组装收割机械，留厂工人还组织技术队伍，利用休假日携带工具协助公社检修机器。中国农业科学院除了抽调九十多名工作人员参加麦收以外，还要与北京市农业科学院合作，帮助公社总结丰产经验，进行科学研究。
    郊区各人民公社经过劳动力的全面安排，都已抽调出强壮的劳动力组成专业的收麦大军。商业部门为郊区准备的二十九万件夏收小农具、十四万片苇席，已经运到使用单位。联合收割机和脱粒机已经开赴田头。
    为了同即将到来的雨季争夺粮食，各人民公社特别注意了防雨准备工作。在抢收中，将根据等价互利的原则，组织坡地与洼地，旱地与水地，种麦多的队与种麦少的队之间的协作，作到熟一块收一块打一块，力争丰产丰收。目前防雨工具还感不足，各人民公社正在设法解决。
    据新华社11日讯　近两个月来，北京郊区干旱缺雨，农作物上连续发生多种病虫害。中共北京市委最近召开了电话会议，要求各区（县）对已发生病虫害的地区立即除治，没有发生的地方也要提高警惕，力争把病虫害消灭在初生阶段。
    据各区（县）公社和北京市农业科学院的调查，当前大田作物棉蚜为害最大，繁殖很快。朝阳区和平公社第四站5月11日至12日调查有棉蚜的幼苗只占棉苗总数0.1％，到5月28日已经有27.2％的棉株发生蚜虫。越冬的玉米钻心虫开始变蛾，生长较高的玉米已经受害。菜区发生较严重的病虫害有菜青虫、地老虎、猿叶虫、黄瓜白粉病、霜霉病等。
    各区（县）、公社发现病虫为害后，已经采取措施组织社员捕打除治，小汤山公社沙河站十二个生产队都组织了专业队，一千八百亩棉田已经普治一遍。市、区商业部门为了不误除治，调拨了大批药械，市生产资料经营处，在最近十天中已经给有关公社连续拨下农药八十五万斤和一部分打药器械。（附图片）
