    Tea-Picking Girls Return to the Village
    Xu Suo
    The smiling sun sets on the hill,
    Tea-picking girls return to the village,
    Going down the mountain is like descending stairs,
    Chattering and singing all the way.
    The dark girl says the tea leaves are strong,
    The clever girl praises the tea's fragrance that travels ten miles;
    The verdant girl praises the tea that sells for much money,
    Everyone gets new clothes!
    The eldest sister doesn't usually like to talk,
    But can't help but open her mouth with joy:
    Don't forget our Party when the tea is good,
    And the soldiers guarding the frontier;
    Let's pick two baskets of tender leaves,
    And send them to Beijing and the frontier;
    High mountains and long rivers express our heart,
    What do you girls think?
    The girls all praise the good idea,
    Happy songs fly far away,
    The tea-picking girls have come down the mountain,
    The dining hall bell rings ding-dong...

    采茶姑娘回村庄
    徐锁
    含笑的太阳落山岗，
    采茶的姑娘回村庄，
    下山就像那下楼梯呵，
    一路说笑一路唱。
    黑姑娘说茶叶儿壮，
    巧姑娘夸茶十里香；
    翠姑娘赞茶卖钱多，
    人人都添花衣裳！
    大姐本不爱讲话，
    忍不住那喜悦也开腔：
    茶好别忘了咱的党，
    还有那战士守边疆；
    咱把嫩叶选两筐，
    送给北京送边疆；
    山高水长表心意，
    姑娘们意见怎么样？
    姑娘们都夸好主张，
    幸福的歌儿飞远方，
    采茶的姑娘下了山呵，
    食堂的钟声响叮当……
