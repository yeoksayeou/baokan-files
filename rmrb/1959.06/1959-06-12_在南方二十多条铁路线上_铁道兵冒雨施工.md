Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The People's Liberation Army Railway Corps, fighting bravely in the rain on more than twenty railway lines in southern China, has reported frequent successes in the enthusiastically launched "High Production, High Quality, Saving, and Safety" competition.

The Railway Corps troops fighting in the Wumeng Mountains of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to build the Weining-Rongfeng section of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, overcame the heavy rainstorms and extremely difficult transportation conditions on the plateau construction site, which is more than 2,000 meters above sea level and densely packed with tunnels and bridges. In May, they completed more than twice the engineering tasks compared to April. Forty of the seventy-two tunnels on this section of the line are now under intense construction. In the Wumeng Mountains, where it has been raining heavily for days, the officers and soldiers of the famous "Tiger Company" worked hard and cleverly, achieving continuous red flags for each shift and each day since May. They created three high-yield and high-quality records and completed 123 meters of tunnel construction in one month, reaching 195% of the state quota, and were commended by the superior leadership. One company, in the tunnel construction of the Dianqian Railway, in the Guiyang-Liuzhi section, attached importance to and adopted various safety measures in the tunnel construction of loose stone, and overcame more than 50 landslides to ensure the smooth progress of the project. On the Guiyang-Liuzhi section of the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway, the progress of the project is also very rapid, with 70% of the bridge and culvert projects completed. A large tunnel in Yanjiaozhai, with a total length of more than 2,700 meters, is being excavated at an accelerated pace. The railway soldiers have passed through several coal seams and underground rivers, fighting against collapses and gas at all times, and have so far penetrated more than 800 meters.

On the Xiangqian Line, there has been continuous rain recently, and the Railway Corps and civilian workers are building roads in the rain. They not only exceeded 86% of the May task in the technically complex bridge and culvert projects, but also built the Loudi-Shaoyang railway in central Hunan with a large amount of manpower and materials. On the Sanshui-Maoming Line in Guangdong, the large iron bridge across the Beijiang River in the upper reaches of the Pearl River has recently started construction ahead of schedule. The officers and soldiers of a Railway Corps unit fighting on this line broke the state quota in eleven of the thirteen projects during intense construction. In addition, many Railway Corps units are actively building more than ten railway branch lines leading to steel bases and important mining and forest areas in various southern provinces, and these road-building units have also created many new records.

During the intense construction, the Railway Corps units closely focused on the basic links of ensuring project quality, construction safety, and increasing production and saving, so that the project quality met the design standards, and saved a large amount of steel, cement, and funds for the country. The troops also carried forward the spirit of combining hard work and clever work, vigorously promoted technological innovation and advanced experience, and tapped potential in all aspects to further push the increase production and saving campaign to a new climax. In the recent half month, the officers and soldiers of a unit on the Neijiang-Kunming Railway line have newly manufactured and modified more than 1,200 various flip-board cars and large waterwheels, making the transportation efficiency five times higher than before.

    在南方二十多条铁路线上
    铁道兵冒雨施工
    新华社11日讯　冒雨奋战在祖国南方二十多条铁路线上的人民解放军铁道兵部队，在热烈展开的“高产、优质、节约、安全”竞赛运动中，捷报频传。
    战斗在云贵高原乌蒙山区修筑内（江）昆（明）铁路威（宁）榕（峰）段的铁道兵部队，在拔海两千多公尺、隧道桥梁密集的铁路工地上，战胜了高原上的暴风骤雨和极端困难的运输条件，凿开坚石顽岩，5月份完成工程任务比4月份翻了一番多。这段线路上的七十二座隧道，已有四十座进入紧张施工。乌蒙山区连日大雨，著名的某部“老虎连”的官兵们猛干巧干，从5月份以来，班班红、日日红，连创三次高产优质纪录，一个月筑好隧道成峒一百二十三公尺，达到国家定额的195％，获得了上级领导机关的表扬。某部一连在石质松碎的隧道施工中，重视和采取了各项安全措施，战胜五十多次塌方，保证工程的顺利进展。在滇黔铁路贵（阳）六（枝）段上，工程的进展也很迅速，全段桥涵工程已完成70％。一座全长两千七百多公尺的岩脚寨大隧道正在加紧掘进，铁道兵战士们穿过了数道煤层和暗河，时刻同坍方、瓦斯作斗争，到目前为止已打进八百多公尺。
    在湘黔线上，最近阴雨连绵，铁道兵部队和民工们冒雨筑路。他们不仅在技术复杂的桥涵工程上超过86％完成了5月份的任务，而且还以大批人力和物力兴筑湖南中部的娄底至邵阳的铁路。在广东三（水）茂（名）线上，横跨珠江上游北江的大铁桥已在最近提前动工建造。战斗在这条线路上的铁道兵某部官兵，在紧张施工中，十三个项目有十一个突破了国家定额。此外，还有许多铁道兵部队正在南方各省积极修建通往钢铁基地和重要矿区、林区的十多条铁路支线，这些筑路部队也创造了很多新纪录。
    在紧张施工中，铁道兵各部队紧紧抓住保障工程质量、施工安全和增产节约的基本环节，使工程质量合乎设计标准，并且为国家节省了大批钢材、水泥和资金。各部队还发扬了苦干与巧干相结合的精神，大兴技术革新和推广先进经验，从各方面挖掘潜力，进一步把增产节约运动推向新的高潮。内（江）昆（明）铁路线上的某部官兵在最近半个月中，新制和改制了各种翻板车、大水车一千二百多辆，使运输效率比原来又提高了五倍。
