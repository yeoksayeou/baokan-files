Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Paris: French newspapers report that the children of the French working people are in dire straits. In France, there is a severe shortage of schools, teachers, kindergartens, and summer camps. "Paris News" admits that 3.5 million French children will not be able to attend summer camps this year. If all children were to attend summer camps, the facilities would have to be tripled at the very least. Government subsidies for existing summer camps are extremely inadequate and are being cut back year after year. In 1945, government subsidies accounted for 50% of summer camp expenses, but now they only account for 7% to 8%.

   There is also a severe shortage of kindergartens in France. According to statistics from the French Women's Union, there are only a dozen kindergartens in the three departments of Bouches-du-Rhone, Rhone, and Gironde. Seventeen departments in France have no kindergartens at all.

    法国儿童处境困苦
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社巴黎30日消息：法国报纸报道，法国劳动人民的子女处境困苦。在法国，学校、教员、幼儿园和夏令营都极为缺乏。“巴黎新闻”承认，今年夏天将有三百五十万法国儿童不能够进夏令营。如果要使所有的儿童都能进夏令营，夏令营的设备至少要增加三倍。政府对现有的夏令营的补助是极为不够的，而且还在一年一年地削减。在1945年，政府给夏令营的补助占夏令营支出的50％，而现在只占到7％到8％。
    幼儿园在法国也极为缺乏。据法兰西妇女联盟统计，在罗纳河口省、罗纳省和纪龙德省三个省，只有十几个幼儿园。法国有十七个省完全没有幼儿园。
