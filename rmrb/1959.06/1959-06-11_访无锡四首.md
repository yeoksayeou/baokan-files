    Four Poems on Visiting Wuxi	Guo Moruo
    Rhyming Responses at Li Garden

    Li Garden is on the shore of Tai Lake in Wuxi, with many artificial hills in the garden. When I first visited, I disliked its excessive artificiality and wrote a five-character律诗 poem to criticize it. Later, thinking about how labor creates the world, which is truly a different realm, I wrote another 律诗 poem to rebuke myself. Thus, I created these rhyming responses.
              (First Poem)
    Why build artificial hills? Li Garden is too contrived!
    Pavilions and terraces lack elegance, colors chase after fleeting trends.
    Abandoning the inexhaustible treasures, seeking what the mundane world desires.
    The best part of Tai Lake, after all, is at Yuantouzhu!
              (Second Poem)
    Your words are quite incorrect; human power can conquer heaven.
    The universe is vast within a pot, flowers add beauty to brocade.
    The sound of the zither follows the winding path, singing enters the clouds in a circle.
    If you want to know the interest of Li Garden, ask the young people at the cliff's head.
      Touring Yuantouzhu
    Gazing from the high building, three mountains float on the water.
    Dark waves surge around, ten thousand acres ripple like golden bubbles.
    Fan Li's small boat is there, the goddess Nü Yi leaves behind her dancing sleeves.
    The supreme meaning of brightness, striving to reach the head of the upstream.
  (Note) Yuantouzhu belongs to Nandu Mountain, on which are the Fan Li Temple and the Nü Yi Shrine. At the top of the mountain is a pavilion called "Brightness," originally without a roof. Comrade Liu Bocheng said it was "Supreme Brightness." This is not only witty but also profoundly meaningful.
      Visiting the Huishan Clay Figurine Factory
    The characters have no past or present, emerging from the hands in an instant.
    Attire and customs change through the ages, loyalty and courage remain the same.
    Creation transforms beautifully before our eyes, spreading far and wide beyond the borders.
    Eight hundred people are gathered, both young and old dedicating their divine skills.
  (Note) Huishan clay figurines are famous throughout the world. They once declined before liberation. Recently, they have become a factory, with seven hundred and seventy-one people engaged in production, and the skills have greatly improved.

    访无锡四首	郭沫若	蠡园唱答
    蠡园在无锡太湖岸上，园中多假山。初游时，颇嫌过于矫揉造作，作五律一首致贬。继思劳动创造世界，实别有天地，乃复作一律以自斥。因成唱答。
              （其一）
    何用垒山丘？蠡园太矫揉！
    亭台亡雅趣，彩色逐时流。
    无尽藏抛却，人间世所求。
    太湖佳绝处，毕竟在鼋头！
              （其二）
    汝言殊不然，人力可戡天。
    宙合壶中大，花添锦上妍。
    琴声随径转，歌唱入云圆。
    欲识蠡园趣，崖头问少年。
      游　鼋　头　渚
    放目倚危楼，三山水面浮。
    四围腾黛浪，万顷泛金沤。
    范蠡扁舟在，女夷舞袖留。
    光明无上意，争赴上游头。
  （注）鼋头渚属于南独山，山上有范蠡庙、女夷祠等。山顶一亭，名曰“光明”，原无顶。刘伯承同志谓为“无上光明”。不仅谑而不虐，且有深意极焉。
      访惠山泥人厂
    人物无今古，须臾出手中。
    衣冠千代异，肝胆一般同。
    创化眼前妙，流传域外通。
    集中人八百，童叟献神工。
  （注）惠山泥人，有名于世。解放前曾一度衰落。近已成厂，集中七百七十一人从事生产，技艺亦大有改进。
