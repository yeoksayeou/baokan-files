Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 16th: The imperialist United States and the dictators it supports are at the brink of launching a military invasion of Cuba.

According to information received here, the main force of the counter-revolutionary elements has been deployed near the Cuban coast. Batista element Masferrer and his gang of war criminals, under the protection of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, are shipping a large amount of military supplies from Miami, USA, to supply the needs of this battle. Trujillo has assembled his planes, ships, and troops, ready to launch an attack on Cuba as soon as the signal is given. At the same time, the U.S. State Department has gathered a group of figures like Castillo Armas (who, in 1954, with U.S. support, armedly overthrew the democratic government of Guatemala - editor), ready to attack Cuba at any time.

Faced with the danger of a military adventure launched by the enemies of the revolution, the Cuban people, the rebel army, the revolutionary government, the working class, the peasants liberated by land reform, and various mass organizations are all on alert, preparing to resolutely repel the danger of armed invasion. Premier Castro has attended three mass rallies in a row last Saturday and Sunday, calling on the people to heighten their vigilance and mobilize to cope with any attempted military invasion.

The Cuban government and the land reform law have the support of the vast majority of the people, including religious figures. Today, the Joint Committee of Cuban Institutions, in the name of forty mass organizations, issued a statement saying that it is prepared to defend land reform and the revolution together with the government. Prominent Cuban religious figures Archbishop Pérez Serantes and Father Evelio Díaz have also issued statements supporting land reform and the revolutionary government.

    美国加紧调兵遣将阴谋武装干涉
    新华社哈瓦那16日电　美帝国主义者和他们所支持的独裁者对古巴发动军事侵略的阴谋已经到达一触即发的地步。
    据此间收到的消息说，反革命势力的主力已经布置在古巴海岸附近。巴蒂斯塔分子马斯费雷尔和他的一伙战犯在美国联邦调查局的保护下，从美国的迈阿密运出大批军火，供应这次战斗的需要。特鲁希略把他的飞机、舰只和部队都集结起来，一等信号发出，就派出去进攻古巴。同时，美国国务院已经收罗有一批卡斯蒂略·阿马斯（他在1954年在美国支持下武装推翻危地马拉民主政府——编者）之流的人物，随时准备进攻古巴。
    面对着革命敌人发动军事冒险的危险，古巴人民、起义军、革命政府、工人阶级、被土地改革解救了出来的农民和一些群众团体都在警惕着，准备坚决迎击武装侵略的危险。卡斯特罗总理上星期六、星期日接连参加了三个群众大会，号召人民提高警惕，动员起来应付任何军事侵略的企图。
    古巴政府和土地改革法得到绝大多数人民包括宗教界人士的支持。今天古巴各机构联合委员会以四十个群众团体的名义发表声明说，它准备同政府一起保卫土地改革和革命。古巴宗教著名人士佩雷兹·塞兰特斯大主教和埃维利奥·迪亚斯神父也曾发表声明，支持土地改革和革命政府。
