Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: According to TASS, the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek Republic and Academician of the Republic's Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Mukhamedzhanov, stated that, according to calculations, within the next ten to fifteen years, the Soviet Union will rank first in the world in terms of per capita production of lint and cotton fabrics.

Academician Mukhamedzhanov made the above remarks at the All-Union Cotton Breeding and Seed Selection Conference, which closed a few days ago. According to his report at the meeting and other materials published at the meeting, within the next ten to fifteen years, or even within twelve years, the Soviet Union's raw cotton production can be increased to 9 million to 10 million tons, that is, an increase of two and a half times last year's production. According to the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will produce more than 6 million tons of raw cotton in 1965.

Academician Mukhamedzhanov said that the main way for the Soviet Union to increase cotton production is to adopt advanced agricultural technology methods to increase the yield of cotton per unit area.

He pointed out that this year, in Uzbekistan, the main cotton production base of the Soviet Union, 90% of the cotton is sown using the advanced square-cluster planting method, which greatly improves the level of mechanization of cotton planting.

He emphasized that the Soviet Union is also carrying out tremendous work in cotton breeding and seed selection. Simply sowing high-yielding cotton varieties can increase cotton yield per hectare by 10% to 15%.

To achieve this goal, there are currently ninety scientific research institutions in the Soviet Union engaged in this work, and they have cultivated dozens of new cotton varieties. Due to improved varieties, the average weight of Soviet cotton bolls has recently increased by two to six point six grams. The length of cotton fiber has also greatly increased.

Academician Mukhamedzhanov spoke highly of the achievements made by various people's democratic countries, especially China, in developing cotton production.

He said that in people's democratic countries, the yield of cotton per unit area (converted to lint) is 6.28 quintals per hectare, but in capitalist countries, only 2.65 quintals of lint per hectare can be harvested.

### 培育良种推广良种　提高机械化的水平  苏联大力改进棉花培植技术  预计十年到十五年按人口平均原棉产量将居世界首位

    培育良种推广良种　提高机械化的水平
    苏联大力改进棉花培植技术
    预计十年到十五年按人口平均原棉产量将居世界首位
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社报道：乌兹别克共和国部长会议副主席、共和国农业科学院院士穆哈麦德扎诺夫说，据计算，最近十年到十五年以内，苏联在按人口平均计算的皮棉产量和棉织品产量方面将居世界第一位。
    穆哈麦德扎诺夫院士的上述谈话是他在日前闭幕的全苏棉花育种和选种会议上发表的。根据他在会议上作的报告和会议发表的其他材料，在今后十年到十五年内甚至十二年以内，苏联的原棉产量就可以增加到九百万吨到一千万吨，即增加为去年的二倍半。按照七年计划的规定，1965年苏联就可以生产六百多万吨原棉。
    穆哈麦德扎诺夫院士说，在苏联增加棉花生产的主要途径是通过采用先进的农业技术方法，提高棉花的单位面积产量。
    他指出，今年，在苏联主要棉花生产基地的乌兹别克，90％的棉花是用先进的正方穴播法播种的，这样，棉花种植工作的机械化水平有了很大提高。
    他强调指出，苏联在棉花育种和选种方面也在进行巨大的工作。单是播种高产量的棉花品种，就可以把每公顷的棉花产量提高10％到15％。
    为了达到这个目的，目前苏联有九十个科学研究机关正在进行这方面的工作，它们已经培育了几十种新的棉花品种。由于改良了品种，最近时期苏联棉铃的平均重量已经增加了两克到六点六克。棉花纤维的长度也大有增加。
    穆哈麦德扎诺夫院士对各人民民主国家特别是中国在发展棉花生产方面所取得的成就给予了很高的评价。
    他说，在人民民主国家，棉花的单位面积产量（折合成皮棉计算）每公顷为六点二八公担，可是在资本主义国家每公顷土地只能收到二点六五公担皮棉。
