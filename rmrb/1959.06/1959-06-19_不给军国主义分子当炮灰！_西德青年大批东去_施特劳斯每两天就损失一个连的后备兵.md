Xinhua News Agency, Berlin Dispatch: A large number of West German youths of conscription age (18 to 25) are fleeing to the German Democratic Republic seeking asylum in order to escape military service for the West German militarists. According to reports, in the twelve days from May 17 to 28 alone, the number of conscription-age youths fleeing from West Germany reached 678. This means that West German Defense Minister Strauss is losing approximately one company of reserve soldiers every two days.

According to statistics recently published by "Neues Deutschland," from the time the Bonn government began conscripting new soldiers in April 1957 until the beginning of May this year, more than 40,600 conscription-age young men have fled from West Germany to the German Democratic Republic to avoid military service, causing Strauss to lose nearly 400 companies of reserve soldiers.

While large numbers of conscription-age young men are fleeing, West German workers and technicians, who have fallen into unemployment due to the deepening West German economic crisis, are also breaking through the West German authorities' obstacles in droves and moving their families to the German Democratic Republic in order to obtain employment opportunities and live happy and stable lives. In the first four months of this year, the total number of West German residents who moved to the German Democratic Republic increased by approximately 84% compared to the same period last year. April increased by 15% compared to March. And around the time the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference opened, the number of immigrants from West Germany increased by 19% compared to April.

    不给军国主义分子当炮灰！
    西德青年大批东去
    施特劳斯每两天就损失一个连的后备兵
    新华社讯　柏林消息：西德大批适龄（十八岁到二十五岁）青年为了逃避为西德军国主义分子服兵役而纷纷逃到德意志民主共和国请求避难。据报道，仅在5月17日到28日的十二天当中，从西德逃来的适龄青年就达到六百七十八名；这就是说，每两天西德国防部长施特劳斯就要丧失大约一个连的后备兵员。
    根据“新德意志报”不久前发表的统计数字，从1957年4月波恩政府开始征召新兵入伍到今年5月初为止，已经有四万零六百多名适龄男青年由西德逃到德意志民主共和国躲避兵役，从而使施特劳斯丧失了差不多四百个连的后备兵员。
    在适龄男青年大批逃亡的同时，由于西德经济危机加深而陷入失业困境的西德工人和技术人员，也纷纷冲破西德当局的重重阻挠，举家迁居德意志民主共和国，以便获得就业机会过幸福安定的生活。今年头四个月里西德居民迁居德意志民主共和国的总户数比去年同期增加了大约84％。4月份比3月份增加了15％。而在日内瓦外长会议开幕前后，来自西德的移民人数更比4月份增加了19％。
