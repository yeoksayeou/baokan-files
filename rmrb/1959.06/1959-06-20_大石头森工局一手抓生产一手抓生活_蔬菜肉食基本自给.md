(Our dispatch from Changchun, June 19th) The Dashihtou Forestry Bureau in the Changbai Mountain forest area, while overfulfilling its timber production plan, has developed the production of subsidiary foods such as pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and vegetables, basically achieving self-sufficiency in subsidiary foods. This ensures that more than 15,000 employees and their families can eat fresh vegetables, meat, eggs, and other subsidiary foods throughout the year.

    The Dashihtou Forestry Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, adhering to the principle of "grasping production with one hand and daily life with the other," began in the spring of 1958 to mobilize employees' families and organize employees to use their spare time to grow vegetables, raise pigs, and raise chickens on a large scale. Currently, the total number of pigs in the bureau has reached more than 1,700, and the number of chickens and ducks has reached more than 21,000. They also raise more than 200 beef cattle, 40 dairy cows, more than 200 sheep, and 10 boxes of bees. This spring, the forestry bureau planted more than 300 hectares of spring and summer vegetables. They have also opened flour mills and tofu shops.

    Due to the development of subsidiary food production, the Dashihtou Forestry Bureau has not only greatly reduced the burden on the state, but more importantly, it has fundamentally improved the lives of forestry workers and their families. Last year, the bureau produced 4.76 million catties of vegetables, accounting for 50% of the required amount. A total of more than 700 pigs were slaughtered throughout the year, with each person eating an average of more than seven catties of self-produced pork. More than 65,000 catties of milk were produced, supplying more than 300 children under the age of one year with all-year-round consumption. More than 60,000 eggs were produced. In addition to supplying the needs of collective catering units such as nurseries, employee hospitals, and canteens, each lying-in woman in the forest area is supplied with 50 to 100 eggs.

    The Dashihtou Forestry Bureau's subsidiary food production is based on the characteristics of the forest area being scattered and the climate being cold. It relies on the masses, gives full play to the wisdom and strength of the masses, and develops diversified operations focusing on vegetable cultivation and pig raising. It has developed by adopting a combination of public and private raising, centralized and decentralized feeding, and centralized and decentralized vegetable cultivation. When they started growing vegetables, they had no land, so they mobilized employees to reclaim wasteland in the forest. When there was insufficient funding, in addition to using part of the bonus fund, they also launched a mass savings campaign among employees, who lent their temporarily unused money to the public to buy poultry and various vegetable seeds.

    Recently, the Party Committee of Dashihtou Forestry Bureau re-planned this year's subsidiary food production according to the increasing demand for subsidiary foods. The plan stipulates that the number of pigs will be bred to 4,000 by the end of the year, the number of chickens and ducks will be bred to more than 27,000, and there will be great development in beef cattle, sheep, rabbits, and bees.

    大石头森工局一手抓生产一手抓生活
    蔬菜肉食基本自给
    本报长春19日电　长白山林区的大石头森林工业局在超额完成木材生产计划的同时，发展猪、羊、鸡、鸭、蔬菜等副食品生产，基本上作到了副食品自给，使全局一万五千多名职工和他们的家属一年四季都能吃到新鲜的蔬菜和肉蛋等副食品。
    中共大石头森林工业局委员会本着“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的原则，从1958年春季开始，就发动职工家属并组织职工利用业余时间大量种菜、养猪、养鸡。到目前，全局生猪已发展到一千七百多头，鸡、鸭发展到二万一千多只，并饲养菜牛二百多头，奶牛四十头，羊二百多只，养蜂十箱。今年春天，这个森工局共种春夏两季蔬菜三百多公顷。还开设了粉房和豆腐房。
    大石头森林工业局由于发展副食品生产，不仅大大减轻了国家的负担，更重要的是从根本上改善了林区职工与职工家属的生活。去年这个局自产蔬菜达四百七十六万斤，占需要量的50％。全年共宰猪七百多头，每人平均吃到自产猪肉七斤多。产奶六万五千多斤，供给一周岁以下的三百多名儿童全年食用。产蛋六万多个，除供应托儿所、职工医院和食堂等集体伙食单位的部分需要外，还供应林区每个产妇五十到一百个鸡蛋。
    大石头森林工业局的副食品生产是根据林区分散，气候寒冷等特点，依靠群众，充分发挥群众智慧和力量，以种菜、养猪为主发展多种经营；采取公养与私养、集中饲养与分散饲养、集中种菜和分散种菜相结合的方法发展起来的。开始种菜时没有土地，他们就发动职工开垦林间荒地。资金不足，他们除用部分奖励基金外，并在职工群众中开展了群众性的存款运动，职工们把暂时不用的钱借给公家购买家禽和各种菜籽。
    最近，大石头森林工业局党委根据副食品需要量日益增长的情况，重新规划了今年的副食品生产。规划中规定，生猪到年底将繁殖到四千头，鸡鸭将繁殖到二万七千多只，菜牛、羊、兔、蜂都将有很大的发展。看，上海机床厂职工食堂养的猪多肥！　新华社记者　霍生联摄
