Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 17th: Anhui Province's spring tea procurement is progressing rapidly. Currently, over 235,900 dan of spring tea have been procured, a 14.32% increase compared to the same period last year.

Tea gardens in Anhui's tea-producing areas have been very well managed this year. Last winter, soil was universally added and fertilizer applied to tea gardens in various locations. This spring, weeding was combined with fertilizer application once to three times, with an average of 300 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer and 40 jin of chemical fertilizer applied per mu. As a result, tea plants are growing well, extending the tea picking time, and many large-scale high-yield tea gardens have emerged.

The quality of spring tea in various locations has also improved. More than 61% of the "Qihong" tea picked at the end of May was of special grade and grade one, an increase of 27% compared to the same period last year. The average price of the 25,000 dan of tea purchased in Anqing Prefecture was 19.2% higher than last year due to improved quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 17th: Yunnan has had a bumper spring tea harvest. Commercial departments have already procured more than 80,000 dan of green tea, black tea, and rough tea, an increase of 47% compared to the same period last year.

Yunnan Province is a famous tea-producing area, and tea production has greatly developed in recent years. Last year's tea procurement volume tripled compared to 1952. This year, thanks to the strength of the People's Communes, the management of tea gardens has been strengthened, and with good rainfall, the spring tea yield has greatly increased compared to last year.

As spring tea picking entered its final stage, Party committees in various places promptly put forward the slogan "Summer tea surpassing spring tea, autumn tea catching up with summer tea." As soon as spring tea picking ended, the communes in the tea areas immediately carried out shallow plowing and fertilization in the tea gardens. Currently, the tea mountains are once again a verdant green, and various localities are striving for a bumper summer tea harvest.

    春茶丰收及时收购
    安徽云南收购又多又快
    新华社合肥17日电  安徽省春茶收购工作进展很快，目前已收购春茶二十三万五千九百多担，比去年同期增长14.32％。
    安徽茶产区今年茶园管理得很好。去年冬天，各地茶园就普遍培土追肥，今年春天又结合锄草普遍追肥一次至三次，平均每亩施杂肥三百担，化肥四十斤，因而茶棵生长良好，延长了采茶时间，出现了许多大面积丰产茶园。
    各地春茶质量也有提高。5月底采摘的“祁红”，特级和一级的占61％多，比去年同期增长27％。安庆专区收购的二万五千担茶，由于质量提高，平均价格比去年高19.2％。
    新华社昆明17日电　云南春茶丰收，商业部门已经收购了青、红、毛茶八万多担，比去年同时期增加47％。
    云南省是著名的茶叶产地，几年来茶叶生产有很大发展，去年的茶叶收购量就比1952年增长三倍。今年由于人民公社力量大，茶园管理工作加强，加上雨水好，春茶的产量又比去年大大增加。
    在春茶采摘进入扫尾阶段时，各地党委及时提出了“夏茶超春茶，秋茶赶夏茶”的口号。春茶采摘一结束，茶区的公社就立即在茶园浅耕施肥。目前茶山又是一片嫩绿，各地正在争取夏茶丰收。
