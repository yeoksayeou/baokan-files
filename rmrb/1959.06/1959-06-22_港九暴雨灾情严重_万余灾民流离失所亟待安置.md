Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 21st - The torrential rains that lasted for four consecutive days, starting on the 12th, have caused significant damage in the urban and suburban areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

According to a communiqué issued by the Hong Kong British Information Services on the 18th, the number of disaster victims requesting relief from the Hong Kong Social Welfare Department has reached 15,004. Statistics indicate that 88 houses have been destroyed, 55 people have died, 62 have been injured, and 19 are missing. On the 14th alone, there were 50 casualties. The poor settlement of Chuan Long Village in Shau Kei Wan, Hong Kong, was almost completely destroyed by giant rocks collapsing from the mountain. In the Kowloon suburbs, more than 2,000 people have lost their homes. Many farmlands there have been flooded, with crop losses ranging from 50% to 90%. Although the floodwaters have receded from some cultivated land, it is still covered by a thick layer of mountain mud, resembling a mudflat.

According to Hong Kong newspapers, these more than ten thousand disaster victims are still displaced and have not received proper resettlement. Most of the disaster victims in the urban areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon are still living on the streets, without any means of support. Many have fallen ill due to the cold and lack of medical care.

Currently, several social organizations in Hong Kong, such as the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, and the neighborhood organizations in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon, are stepping up their efforts to raise donations to provide emergency relief to the disaster victims.

    港九暴雨灾情严重
    万余灾民流离失所亟待安置
    新华社香港21日电　从12日开始一连四天的暴雨，在港九市区和郊区造成了重大的损失。
    据香港英国新闻处18日发表的公报，向香港社会福利署要求登记救济的灾民已达一万五千零四人。据统计，有八十八所民房被毁，五十五人死亡，六十二人受伤，十九人失踪。仅14日一天就死伤了五十人。香港筲箕湾贫民集居的川龙村几乎全村都被山上崩下的巨石压毁，九龙郊区有二千多人丧失家园，那里不少农田被淹，农作物受到的损失达50％至90％，有些耕地虽然积水已退，但仍为一层厚厚的山泥所掩盖，有如一片泥滩。
    据香港报纸报道，这一万多名灾民现在仍然流离失所，没有获得妥善的安置，港九市区大部灾民至今仍然露宿街头，生活无着，由于受寒乏医，其中有不少人已经病倒。
    目前，香港的若干社会团体，如港九工会联合会、香港中华总商会、香港华人革新协会和港九各区街坊会组织等正在加紧募集捐款，对灾民进行紧急救济。
