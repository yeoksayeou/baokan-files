Never Let the "Teutonic Sword" Act Again
Wei Wei

　　The pages of history turn back to the turbulent years before World War II.

　　……October 9, 1934. In Marseilles, a major port in southern France. A luxurious convertible, carrying King Alexander of Yugoslavia, who had just arrived from the Adriatic coast for a state visit, and French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou, who came to greet him, was slowly proceeding through the crowd welcoming them. Suddenly, several fascist thugs, with a swiftness that caught everyone off guard, assassinated the two statesmen who were preparing to discuss countermeasures against Hitler's aggression. The limousine suddenly turned into a hearse, and the grand welcoming scene immediately evolved into a chaotic fight...

　　This is the historical footage of an international political assassination that shocked Europe twenty-five years ago, which we see in the film "The Teutonic Sword in Action." The film workers of the German Democratic Republic, using many precious historical materials and outstanding editing techniques, vividly and powerfully expose the crimes of the Hitler Nazi gang in preparing and launching World War II, and the fact that West Germany is reviving militarism today, through the planning, arrangement, and action of this political assassination plan called "The Teutonic Sword in Action." It is a powerful political commentary calling on people to take action against the revival of German militarism.

　　Starting with the assassination of Barthou and Alexander, Hitler took further steps to pave the way for his own aggressive expansion. Six years after the Marseilles assassination, the Nazi swastika flag was planted on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. At this time, Captain Hans Speidel, the assistant military attache of the German Embassy in France, who was ordered to carry out the sinister plan of "The Teutonic Sword in Action," also ascended to the throne of the French emperor by stepping on the blood and bones of the European people. Subsequently, Speidel also carried out activities on the Eastern Front as a Nazi general. Because of his faithful execution of Hitler's conspiracy, many cities were destroyed and millions of people were plunged into catastrophe. His "achievements" led Hitler to personally award him the Knight's Cross and promote him to lieutenant general.

　　The film emphasizes the exposure of Speidel's countless crimes in those years, because this very same Speidel, Hitler's loyal servant, has now transformed himself into a pillar of West German militarism and a favorite of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. In the Palace of Fontainebleau, where he drafted the French surrender agreement, he is now, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central European Ground Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, plotting an atomic war against the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp to destroy humanity. From the film, we can see that those Nazi war criminals and Hitler's arms tycoons are today occupying key positions in West Germany and carrying out activities on a large scale. They are trying to reassemble and start up Hitler's war machine, and once again impose the disaster of fascist enslavement on the people of Europe.

　　This film, which won an award at the 11th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, powerfully tells us that although the likes of Speidel and their American masters are still plotting Hitler's anti-Soviet and anti-communist war conspiracies of the past, today's Europe is not the Europe of the past. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become a powerful factor in maintaining peace in Europe and the world. In Berlin, in Germany, and throughout Europe, the people's struggle against the revival of West German militarism has converged into a torrent. They will never allow that "Teutonic Sword" to be unsheathed and put into action again. They will resolutely fight to crush the imperialist threat to humanity!

    决不让“条顿剑”再行动
    韦维
    历史的篇页翻回到第二次世界大战前的动荡的年代。
    ……1934年10月9日。在法国南部要港马赛。一辆豪华的敞篷汽车，载着刚从亚得里亚海畔前来作国事访问的南斯拉夫国王亚历山大和来迎接他的法国外长路易·巴图，在夹道欢迎的人群中徐徐行进。突然间，几个法西斯暴徒以令人措手不及的迅速行动，刺杀了这两位准备共商对付希特勒侵略对策的政治家。礼车忽然变成柩车，隆重的欢迎场面也顿时演为一场混乱的格斗……。
    这就是我们在电影“条顿剑在行动”中看到的二十五年前曾经轰动欧洲的国际性政治谋杀案的历史镜头。德意志民主共和国的电影工作者，运用许多珍贵的历史材料和杰出的剪辑手法，通过被称为“条顿剑在行动”这个政治暗杀计划的策划、布置和行动，生动有力地揭露了希特勒纳粹匪帮准备和发动第二次世界大战的罪行，和今天西德正在复活军国主义的事实。它是一篇号召人们行动起来反对德国军国主义复活的有力的政论。
    从暗杀巴图和亚历山大开始，希特勒得寸进尺地为自己的侵略扩张开辟道路。在马赛暗杀发生六年后，纳粹的卐字旗就插上了巴黎的爱弗尔铁塔。这时，奉命执行“条顿剑在行动”这个罪恶计划的德国驻法大使馆助理武官汉斯·斯派达尔上尉，也已踏着欧洲人民的鲜血与白骨而登上了法国太上皇的宝座。随着，斯派达尔又以纳粹将领的身份到东线战场进行活动。由于他忠实地执行着希特勒的阴谋，使许多城市被毁灭，使千百万人民陷于浩劫。他的“功绩”使希特勒亲自颁发给他骑士勋章，升他为中将。
    影片所以要着重揭露斯派达尔当年的累累罪行，因为就是这个希特勒的忠臣斯派达尔，今天又摇身一变而成为西德军国主义的一根支柱，成为北大西洋侵略集团的红人。就在当年他起草法国投降协定的枫丹白露宫里，今天他又以北大西洋公约组织中欧地面部队总司令的身份，在策划着反对苏联和社会主义阵营各国的毁灭人类的原子战争。从影片中我们可以看到，那些纳粹战犯和希特勒的军火大王们今天都在西德窃据要津，大肆活动了。他们正想把希特勒的战争机器重新装配和开动起来，把法西斯奴役的灾难再一次强加在欧洲人民的身上。
    这部在第十一届卡罗维·发利国际电影节获奖的影片有力地告诉我们，尽管斯派达尔之流和他们的美国主子今天仍然在策划着当年希特勒的反苏反共战争阴谋，但是，今天的欧洲已不是当年的欧洲。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营已成为维护欧洲与世界和平的强大因素。在柏林，在德国，在整个欧洲，人民反对复活西德军国主义的斗争，已经汇成了一股洪流。他们决不容许那把“条顿剑”重新出鞘行动。他们将坚决进行斗争，粉碎帝国主义对人类的威胁！
