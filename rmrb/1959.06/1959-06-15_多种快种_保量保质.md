    河北 [Hebei]
    Thirty Million Mu of Wheat Stubble Replanting
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin – According to the spirit of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee’s instruction to "strive to replant all arable land with another season of crops" and past experiences, Party organizations in various communes in Hebei Province used the method of intercropping in wheat fields to complete part of the replanting tasks ahead of schedule. According to incomplete statistics from the Handan, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang regions, over 1.7 million mu have been intercropped using this method.
    In order to increase total grain output, Hebei Province plans to expand the replanting area to 30.61 million mu this year, accounting for 88.5% of the total wheat field area, an increase of 5.03 million mu over last year. Seizing the time to carry out wheat stubble replanting is an important aspect of expanding the replanting area. Communes in various regions have made full preparations for fertilizers and seeds required for replanting in advance, arranged manpower and animal power, organized professional teams, and implemented a responsibility system of fixed tasks, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed bonuses for exceeding quotas. In the Handan area in the south, where wheat matures earlier, the summer planting is progressing simultaneously with the wheat harvest, achieving simultaneous harvesting, manure delivery, tilling, and sowing.
    In the work of expanding the replanting area and rushing to plant, many places, under the unified leadership of the commune, organized large-scale cooperation between management sections and production teams based on the principle of distribution according to work and equivalent exchange, which accelerated the progress of summer planting.

    Carry out the "No Idle Land" Movement to Actively Expand the Planting of Grain and Oil Crops
    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, June 14 – People's communes in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are seizing the time, competing for every inch of land, and actively expanding the planting area of crops such as grain and oil during the summer planting season.
    Recently, after discussing output targets and contract labor production, the enthusiasm of commune members has soared to unprecedented levels. According to the principle of planting more to harvest more and cultivating large-scale, high-yield demonstration fields simultaneously, every commune is striving to plant more this summer. Commune members say that planting all scattered vacant land and combining intercropping with summer planting will ensure "a green scene now" and "full granaries in autumn." Currently, from the Yinchuan Plain in the Yellow River irrigation area to the mountainous areas in the south, a mass "no idle land" movement has unfolded. Farmers in the Shizuishan area of the northern plain are taking measures such as expanding the replanting area of wheat stubble, fully utilizing mature wasteland, planting corn in vegetable fields, and sowing grain and feed crops along canals, field ridges, field edges, villages, and houses to expand planting. In the Guyuan area in the south, 70,000 people are advancing at a rate of 100,000 mu of autumn crops planted per day. Jingyuan County, where Hui people live in concentrated communities, rushed to plant for twenty days, sowing more than 21,000 mu of oil crops and hemp, exceeding the original plan by 6% and increasing by more than 2,300 mu compared to last year.
    四川 [Sichuan]
    Grasp Both Grain and Economic Crops
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 14 – Under the slogan of "Plant everything everywhere, plant more and harvest more," farmers in Sichuan Province, after more than a month of intense battle, have successfully completed the summer planting work and ensured quality. According to preliminary statistics, the planting area of several major grain and economic crops has expanded by nearly 4 million mu compared to last year's summer planting.
    At the beginning of this year's summer planting, Party committees at all levels carried out large-scale publicity and mobilization work, educating cadres and the masses to fully understand the agricultural production increase policy of combining planting more to harvest more with cultivating large-scale, high-yield demonstration fields. Expansion plans were drawn up at every level from the county to the commune to the team, and unsuitable planting plans were revised. The Neijiang area originally planned to plant 4.5 million mu of rice, sweet potatoes, and corn, which was increased to 6.4 million mu after revision. The Wenjiang area, with its dense population and high land replanting index, also expanded the grain planting area by 500,000 mu after careful calculation. Farmers in various regions also adopted various methods for intercropping, overcropping, and additional planting.
    Grasping both grain and economic crops, as well as both major and minor crops, is another feature of this year's summer planting work in Sichuan Province. The area of rice, mid-season rice, and cotton in the province has expanded compared to last year, and the area of peanuts, sesame, hemp, and other crops has also increased compared to last year, totaling nearly 2 million mu. During the rush planting, people's communes in various regions attached great importance to quality and adopted many effective measures to ensure that planting was fast and good in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture.

    多种快种　保量保质
    河北
    麦茬复种三千万亩
    据新华社天津电　河北省各地公社的党组织根据省委“力争把一切能够复种的土地再种一季作物”的指示精神和过去的经验，用在麦田套种的办法，提前完成了一部分复种任务。据邯郸、保定两个专区及石家庄专区的不完全统计，用这种办法已套种了一百七十多万亩。
    河北省为了提高粮食总产量，今年复种面积计划扩大到三千零六十一万亩，占麦田总面积的88.5％，比去年扩大五百零三万亩。抢时间进行麦茬复种，是扩大复种面积的一个重要方面。各地公社事先都对复种需要的肥料、种籽作了充分准备，对人力、畜力作了安排，组织了专业队，实行定任务、定时间、定质量、定超额奖励的责任制度。南部麦熟较早的邯郸地区，现在夏播正与收麦同时并进，作到了随收割、随送粪、随耕地、随播种。
    在扩大复种面积抢种工作中，许多地方在公社统一领导下，根据按劳取酬、等价交换的原则，组织管理区间、生产队间的大协作，使夏播工作加快了进度。

    开展“无闲地”运动积极扩种粮食油料
    新华社银川14日电　宁夏回族自治区各人民公社在夏种中，抢时间，争寸土、积极扩大粮食、油料等作物的播种面积。
    最近，自治区各地人民公社在讨论了产量落实和包工包产之后，社员生产积极性空前高涨。根据广种多收和培植大面积高额丰产田同时并行的方针，社社争取今夏多种。社员们说，零星空地都种上，间作夏种一齐来，现在作到“一片青”，秋后才能“粮满仓”。目前，从黄河灌区的银川平原到南部山区，一个群众性的“无闲地”运动已经展开。北部平原石咀山地区的农民，正在采取扩大麦茬地复种面积，充分利用熟荒地和在菜田中点种玉米，在渠边、地埂、田边、村旁、屋边播种粮食和饲料作物等办法，进行扩种。南部固原专区七万大军以日播大秋作物十万亩的速度，向前挺进。回民聚居的泾源县，抢种二十天，播种了油料和大麻二万一千多亩，超过原定计划6％，比去年增加二千三百多亩。

    既抓粮食
    又抓经济作物
    据新华社成都14日电　四川省农民在“全种全栽、多种多收”的口号下，经过一个多月的紧张战斗，胜利地完成了夏种工作，并且保证了质量。据初步统计，几种主要粮食和经济作物的播种面积比去年夏种扩大了近四百万亩。
    今年夏种一开始，各地中共党委都开展了大规模的宣传动员工作，教育干部和群众全面理解多种多收和培植大面积高额丰产田相结合的农业增产方针，从县到社到队，层层订出了扩种规划，对不合适的播种计划也进行修改。内江专区原计划种水稻、甘薯、玉米四百五十万亩，经过修改增加到六百四十万亩，人烟稠密、土地复种指数相当高的温江专区经过精打细算也扩大了粮食播种面积五十万亩。各地农民还采取多种多样的办法进行间种、套种和增种。
    既抓粮食又抓经济作物，既抓大宗作物又抓小宗作物，是四川省今年夏种工作的另一个特点。全省不仅水稻、中稻、棉花面积比去年扩大，而且花生、芝麻、麻类等面积也都比去年增加，共计近二百万亩。在抢种中，各地人民公社都很重视质量，采取许多有效措施保证按着农业“八字宪法”的要求种快、种好。
