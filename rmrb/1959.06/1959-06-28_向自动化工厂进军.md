    Marching Towards Automated Factories
    By our correspondent Li Nan
    This is the factory's tomorrow
    In the spacious and bright workshop of the First Ball Bearing Factory in Moscow, two rows of complex machines are working evenly and rhythmically. One by one, the raw parts are fed into one end of the machine group, and after passing through a series of processes, they emerge at the other end as sets of shiny bearings. Throughout the entire production process, there is no need for human hands to operate. People do not have to be attached to every lathe like in ordinary machine factories, and there are hardly any people moving around in the workshop.
    Lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, heat treatment, assembly, and even packaging... twenty or thirty processes are automatically completing their tasks. The parts are automatically transferred between the lathes by operating machines. Everything is perfectly timed, not a second off. What's even more remarkable are the automatic machines that handle the inspection tasks. They detect and reject products that are slightly below the strict standards, pushing them aside and counting the number. Next to the assembly machine, the ingenious automatic operation is particularly astonishing and admirable. The machinery, like the most skilled pair of hands, selects a set of balls and rollers that match the bearing from countless options and evenly places them inside the bearing. The final inspection is particularly strict, calculating one last time the number of qualified products and the number of unqualified products. Perhaps the automatic machine has finally completed its task here? No, there's still wrapping them in paper, placing them in wooden boxes, and packing them into boxes. These tasks also do not require human operation.
    Ingenious design and various scientific and technological achievements enable people to embody their will in metal. Standing next to these working machines, we feel that these machines are not cold, lifeless objects, but something that can calculate and think. The foreman, Lukanov, who guided our tour, gave us a brief introduction: This automated workshop is actually equivalent to an independent automated factory. Its production capacity is 1.5 million sets of ball and roller bearings, and only the Soviet Union currently has such a facility. Its labor productivity is twice that of a regular workshop of the same size, and the quality of the bearings produced is one to four times longer than those produced in ordinary workshops.
    The automated workshop reduces the amount of labor for workers and changes the nature of labor. After this workshop was built, all the workers in the factory not only wanted to be assigned to work here but also wanted to rebuild their workshops, all twenty-eight workshops in the factory, according to this model. Taking the path of automated workshops, taking the path of full automation, and transforming the factory into a fully automated factory is the direction the employees are striving for in the Seven-Year Plan. Workers who saw the work of the automated workshop said: This is the tomorrow of our workshop, the tomorrow of the entire factory.
    Origins and Prospects
    In the office of the factory's Party Secretary, Kvachev, a man in his forties, gave us a detailed talk, pointing out the origin, development, and prospects of the automated workshop.
    This automated workshop should be said to be the result of successive movements to improve labor productivity after the war. After the war, the factory's production tasks increased, and there was a shortage of skilled workers. Therefore, a movement was launched for each worker to oversee more lathes. First, each worker watched four machines, and later it developed to six machines. But physical strength is limited after all, and the more machines watched, the more stops there are. Among the workers watching multiple machines, a desire naturally arose: Can machines be used to supervise machines themselves, solving the problem of further improving labor productivity?
    Under this trend, the factory relied on all employees and proposed the requirement to innovate existing technology, changing machines that needed manual operation into semi-automated ones, and further into fully automated ones. The employees then connected these automatic lathes, designed ingenious conveyors, formed automatic machine groups, and created the first automated production line.
    The First Ball Bearing Factory is the largest bearing factory in the Soviet Union, and also the oldest. 42% of the factory's production equipment consists of lathes and machines that are more than twenty years old, and 25% are between ten and twenty years old. Although the machines have been working for a long time, the factory has grasped the important link of continuously modernizing and automating the machines. Therefore, they have not become obsolete, but have become the pioneers of the national machinery industry in advancing towards the peak of technological progress.
    In recent years, the factory's automation achievements have been satisfactory. Relying entirely on its own strength, while producing and improving, the factory has established seven automated production lines, twenty mechanized conveyor belts, and automated and modernized more than 1,500 lathes and thousands of machines for control, lifting, and transmission.
    On this basis, a factory-type automated workshop appeared. Based on the results of this workshop's three years of work, almost everyone in the factory has clarified the further task: to build a fully automated factory.
    During the Seven-Year Plan period, the factory will not build new factory buildings or add equipment, but it will double its output. If you consider that this largest bearing factory in the Soviet Union produces tens of millions of sets of 1,500 types of bearings every year, the magnitude of this task can be imagined. The factory calculated that as long as it takes the road of full automation and builds the factory into an automated factory, it can complete this task. The emergence of this automatic factory will probably be divided into three stages: the first stage, by 1960, to build an automated workshop with an annual production capacity of 30 million sets of universal joints; the second stage, by 1962, to build another automated workshop with an annual production capacity of 30 million sets of roller bearings; the third stage, by 1965, to build two new automated workshops with an annual production of 70 million ball bearings. After completing this road, a completely automated factory will grow up.
    A Collective Undertaking
    A vigorous movement towards automated factories has been launched in the First Ball Bearing Factory. Kvachev said it well: The factory has mobilized all employees to participate in the cause of full automation, creating the most solid and reliable foundation. Under a clear goal, the factory has combined the masses and leaders, technical personnel, and internal and external forces.
    We came to the factory's automation and mechanization design department. Although it was morning, it was empty. The designers had all gone down to the workshops. Design groups were organized in each workshop, and ordinary workers and technicians participated. In many workshops, we saw that while production was underway, designers and workers were focused on automating existing lathes. In a workshop room, we met designer Kvarkin, who was busy with an adjuster modifying the automatic conveyor on a lathe. Adjuster Kiselev said that after this conveyor is made, it will change the situation where workers of these lathes cannot leave the lathe for a step.
    In the movement of full automation, from factory director Gromov and Party Secretary Kvachev to ordinary workers, everyone praised the role played by the widespread organization of comprehensive work teams and the widespread holding of production technology conferences. There are many comprehensive work teams, and they undertake key automation projects. Production technology conferences are held frequently from the workshop to the entire factory, widely collecting initiatives on automation work.
    In a workshop that is scheduled to be fully automated next year, a comprehensive work team is busy working on establishing two automated production lines. Leading engineer and foreman Kozlov, lathe operator Kalinin, and adjuster Gubanov are installing automatic operation and conveyors on grinding machines. The leading engineers told us: They want to automate twenty-two lathes before the end of the year and then connect them to become an automated production line.
    The factory's Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations are all fully involved in leading the full automation work. The Communist Youth League has specially organized an automation and mechanization staff, and below it, many combat teams have been organized, absorbing young production innovators, and striving to quickly establish a huge automated factory.
    Far-reaching Significance
    Full automation not only increases the output of products, but more importantly, it changes the nature and content of labor. Workers are transformed from appendages of machines into masters of machines. Their task is no longer to operate next to the machine every minute but only to check and manage the machine's operation. Workers not only reduce their physical labor but also need to fully understand the entire production technology and many aspects of scientific knowledge. This has a profound impact on workers and labor.
    Kvachev, when talking to us about the significance of the automated factory as a direction, was not limited to economic and production aspects. He said: The issue of full automation has significant political significance. Full automation can narrow the boundary between physical labor and mental labor. According to the current situation of the automated workshop, the personnel working there must have the level of technicians and engineers, spending less energy to participate in the operation, and most of the time is used for management and thinking. Here, the boundary between intellectual labor and physical labor is greatly shortened.
    While establishing the automated factory, the First Ball Bearing Factory will implement a six-hour workday in the Seven-Year Plan and will also enable every worker to have the level of a technician. Currently, one-third of the workers in the factory are participating in learning, either studying in youth night schools or studying in secondary technical schools and higher vocational schools without leaving production; some are even pursuing advanced studies as graduate students in the branches of the Academy of Sciences organized in the factory.
    Improving the cultural and technical level of each worker, replacing heavy labor with automatic machines, and eliminating the boundary between physical labor and intellectual labor, the workers of the First Ball Bearing Factory are striving to climb the peak of the world's latest technology.

    向自动化工厂进军
    本报记者　李楠
    这就是全厂的明天
    在莫斯科第一滚珠轴承工厂宽大明亮的车间里，两排复杂的机器群正在均匀地有节奏地工作着。一个个的毛胚部件从机器群的一端运送进去，经过一道道的工序，在另一端出来的时候，变成了成套的发亮的轴承。在整个生产过程中，不需要人的手去操作，人不必附着在每一部车床上，像普通的机器工厂那样，而且几乎就看不到人在车间走动。
    车床、钻床、铣床、热处理、装配乃至包装……二、三十道工序都自动地在完成着自己的任务。部件在车床之间被自动的运转机器传来送去，一切都恰到好处，不差一分一秒。更难得的是那些负担检查任务的自动机器，它们把稍微一点不够严格标准的产品检举出来，推在一边，并且计算数目。在装配机器旁边，那奇妙灵巧的自动操作特别令人惊讶赞美。机械像一只最熟练的巧手一样，在无数滚珠和滚柱中挑选出和轴承相配合的一套，然后均匀地安放在轴承里面。最后一道检查是特别严格的，它最后一次计算合格产品的数目和不合格产品的多少。也许自动机器到这里总算完成任务了罢，不，还有用纸包起来，放在木箱里面，打成一箱箱的，这些劳动也不需要人来操作。
    无比巧妙的设计和各式各样的科学技术成就，使得人能够把自己的意志体现在金属上面。我们站在这些工作着的机器旁边，会感觉到这机器似乎并不是缺少生命的冰冷的事物，而是一种会计算思考的东西。引导我们参观的工长卢堪诺夫给我们作了简短的介绍：这个自动化车间实际上等于一个独立的自动化工厂，一半的生产能力是一百五十万套滚珠和滚柱轴承，世界上现在只有苏联有这么一个，它的劳动生产率比同样大小的普通车间提高一倍，生产的轴承质量比普通车间生产的耐用时间长一倍至四倍。
    自动化车间减少了工人的劳动量，改变了劳动的性质。这个车间建成之后，全厂的工人不仅都想能分派到这里来工作，并且都想根据这个榜样来改建自己的车间、全厂的二十八个车间。走自动化车间的道路，走全盘自动化的道路，把工厂改造成全部自动化的工厂，这就是职工们作为七年计划中奋斗的方向，工人们看了自动车间的工作都说：这就是我们车间的明天，全厂的明天。
    起源和远景
    在工厂党委书记克瓦契夫的办公室里，这个年纪约四十来岁的人和我们作了详尽的谈话，指明了自动化车间的来龙去脉，起源和远景。
    这个自动化车间应该说是战后历次提高劳动生产率运动的结果。在战后，工厂生产任务加重，熟练工人缺乏，因此发起每个工人多看车床的运动。先每个工人守四台机器，后来又发展到六台机器。但体力毕竟是有限的，看的台数多，停歇也就增多。从看多台机器的工人当中，首先就自然而然地产生出了一种愿望，能不能用机器自己看管机器，解决进一步提高劳动生产率的问题。
    在这种趋势下，工厂依靠了全体职工，提出了革新现有技术的要求，将需要人手操纵的机器改成半自动化的；进一步变成完全自动化的。职工们又将这些自动的车床联结起来，设计出精巧的传送器，构成自动机组，创造出了第一条自动化作业线。
    第一滚珠轴承工厂是苏联最大的一个轴承工厂，同时也是最老的一个。工厂生产设备42％是二十年以上的车床和机器，25％是在十年到二十年之间。机器工作的年龄虽久，但因工厂抓紧不断将机器近代化和自动化这个重要环节，至今不但没有陈旧，反而成为全国机械工业向技术进步高峰进军的先锋。
    几年来，工厂自动化的成绩是令人满意的。完全依靠自己的力量，一边生产，一边改进，工厂建立了七条自动化作业线，二十条机械化传送带，使一千五百多部车床，以及几千部属于控制、起落、传送的机器自动化和现代化了。
    在这个基础上出现了工厂型式的自动化车间。根据这个车间三年工作的结果，工厂几乎每一个人都明确了进一步的任务：建立全部的自动化工厂。
    在七年计划期中，工厂不增建厂房，不添加设备，但要增加一倍产量。如果考虑一下这个全苏最大的轴承工厂每年生产数以千万套计的一千五百种类型的轴承，那么这个任务的巨大就可以想像了。工厂计算了一下，只要走全面自动化的道路，把工厂建成自动化工厂，就可以完成这个任务。这个自动工厂的出现大概将分三个阶段：第一个阶段，到1960年建成年产能力三千万套万向轴承的自动化车间；第二个阶段，到1962年再建成年产能力也是三千万套滚柱轴承的又一个自动化车间；第三个阶段，到1965年更建成年产七千万滚珠轴承的两个新自动化车间。走完了这段道路，一个完全的自动化工厂就会成长起来了。
    集体的事业
    一个蓬蓬勃勃的向自动化工厂进军的运动在第一滚珠轴承工厂开展起来了。克瓦契夫说得好：工厂发动了全体职工参加全面自动化的事业，造成一个最坚实可靠的基础。在明确的目标下面，工厂把群众和领导，技术人员，内部和外部的力量都结合起来了。
    我们来到工厂的自动化机械化设计处，虽然正是上午，但这里却是空空的，设计师们都下到了车间里面。在各个车间里面都组织设计组，普通工人、技术人员都参加进去。在许多车间里，我们都看到一边进行生产，一边设计人员和工人都专心地把现有的车床自动化起来。在一个车间室里，我们碰到设计师克瓦尔金正在和一位调整工一道忙着改造车床上的自动传送器。调整工基塞略夫说，这个传送器制成之后，就改变了这几部车床工人离不开车床一步的情况。
    在全面自动化的运动中，从工厂厂长格罗莫夫、党委书记克瓦契夫到普通的工人都很称赞普遍组织综合工作队和广泛举行生产技术会议所起的作用。综合工作队有许多个，它们担任关键性的自动化工程。生产技术会议，从车间到全厂都经常举行，广泛搜集关于自动化工作的创议。
    在一个规定在明年就要全面自动化的车间里，一个综合工作队正在忙碌地为建立两条自动化作业线工作着。领导工程师和工长科兹洛夫、车工卡里宁、调整工古班诺夫，正在磨床上装设自动操作和传送器。领导工程师们对我们说：他们要在年底前自动化二十二部车床，然后联结起来变成自动化作业线。
    工厂党、团、工会组织都全力投入全面自动化工作的领导。共青团专门组织了自动化机械化参谋部，下面组织了许多战斗小组，吸收青年的生产革新者，为了迅速建立一个巨大的自动化工厂而奋斗。
    深远的意义
    全面自动化不仅提高产品的产量，而且更重要的是改变了劳动的性质和内容。工人从机器的附属品变成机器的主人。他的任务不再是在机器旁边一分钟也离不开的操作，而只是检查和管理机器的工作情况。工人不但体力上的劳动减轻了，而且需要充分了解整个的生产技术和许多方面的科学知识。这对工人和劳动的影响当然是深远的。
    克瓦契夫在和我们谈到自动化工厂作为一个方向的意义不仅限于经济上的和生产上的　他说：全面自动化的问题有重大的政治上的意义。全面自动化能缩小体力劳动和智力劳动的界限。根据现在自动化车间的状况，那里工作的人员都要具有技术人员和工程师的水平，只用较少的精力来参加操作，大部分时间用来管理和思考，在这里智力劳动和体力劳动的界限是大大缩短了。
    在建立自动化工厂同时，第一滚珠轴承工厂要在七年计划内实行每天六小时的工作制，并且还要使每个工人都具备技术人员的程度。现在工厂中三分之一的工人都在参加学习，或者在青年夜校里补习，或者不脱离生产地在中等技术学校、高等专门学校读书；有的还在科学院在工厂组织的分支机构里当研究生深造。
    提高每个工人的文化技术水平，用自动机器代替繁重的劳动，消除体力劳动和智力劳动的界限，第一滚珠轴承厂的工人正在努力攀登世界最新技术的高峰。苏联通讯
