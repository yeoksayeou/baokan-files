Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 31st: Since the dissolution of the former reactionary local government of Tibet, the vast number of Tibetan children have ended their tragic fate inherited for generations and begun to live a new life of freedom and joy.

In Lhasa, Shigatse, Qamdo, Shannan, Heihe and other places, the number of children entering school has generally increased in the past two months. Shortly after the suppression of the Lhasa rebellion, the number of children entering school increased by more than 1,500, most of whom were children of serfs and orphans who had been wandering around not long ago. The two primary schools in Lhasa, opened after liberation, had never been full in the past eight years, but now they cannot accommodate all the children. The third primary school newly opened by the Cultural and Educational Department of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region received more than 600 applications in the first two days of enrollment, and the Preparatory Committee had to start preparing to build the fourth primary school. In order to give all school-age children the opportunity to learn culture, the Lhasa Military Control Commission recently helped various neighborhood committees to run 19 cultural schools in a non-governmental manner. In the Shannan area, the number of children entering school at Zedang Primary School more than doubled after the rebellion was quelled compared to before the rebellion. Sangri Dzong on the Yarlung Zangbo River had never had a school in the past. With the help of the military control commission's working group, the local people recently established the first primary school, enabling 80% of the school-age children in the area to attend school.

In the past, the children of serfs were registered in the account books of the serf owners from the first day of their birth, and the children's parents were forced to pay "birth tax" and "head tax"; when they were a little older, they had to follow their parents to fetch water, chop firewood, pick up manure, herd livestock, and bear other heavy labor for the masters. At that time, going to school was only a dream for these poor children, and even if they could barely go to school, they would be persecuted by the reactionary regime and headmen. Wangdui, a student at Lhasa Middle School, was grabbed by several Tibetan soldiers and thrown into a mud pond for attending school despite the headman's obstruction. Fortunately, his classmates came to rescue him, but his ears were deafened by the sewage. Another child named Awang Jiacuo was stabbed in the arm by reactionary elements on his way to school and could not move for more than half a month. Many children were beaten by reactionaries for carrying school textbooks and wearing red scarves. Wuzhu Pengcuo, Nima Zeren, and Gesang Pengcuo, students at Lhasa No. 1 Primary School, dug a secret underground cave themselves to hide their textbooks and red scarves when school was over.

Since the basic suppression of the rebellion in Tibet, the People's Liberation Army military control commissions in various places have done a lot of work to improve the living conditions of children. Children who used to wander the streets have now moved into new homes with their parents, children living in poverty have received relief, and many children have been sent to school. Children in school can study without worries, can freely spend their holidays in the Linka (gardens), and no one will hinder them anymore. A nursery rhyme that has recently become popular among Tibetan children says: "The Kashag is completely rotten, it is best to eliminate it completely, no longer being beaten and scolded, no longer doing Ula service, the feudal mountain has been overthrown, and the happy sun has risen."

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 31st: The story of a Tibetan Young Pioneer bravely breaking through the blockade of rebel bandits' bullets and reporting the enemy situation to the People's Liberation Army and local authorities is being spread on the northern Tibetan grasslands. The name of this Young Pioneer is Renqing Zhaxi.

The incident occurred in January this year. At that time, in the Thirty-Nine Clan Grassland, reactionary elements in the Dingqing area, led by Gabenri, were gathering bandits and stepping up their plans to attack the People's Liberation Army stationed in Dingqing and local authorities. At 8:30 a.m. on January 24, half an hour before the rebels planned to openly besiege our authorities and troops, Renqing Zhaxi learned of this situation, and he hurriedly reported it to the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army outpost. However, at this time, the telephone line from the outpost to the authorities and troops' residence had been cut by the rebels, and contact could not be made, and the enemy's blockade was very tight. At this critical moment, Renqing Zhaxi volunteered to deliver a letter to the authorities. Taking advantage of a rebel bandit with a broadsword walking past, he ran cleverly and bravely to the residence of the authorities. As soon as he ran to the bridgehead, he heard continuous gunshots. At this time, the rebels in Dingqing City had already begun to besiege our troops guarding the city. The rebels saw this running child and brutally shot at him. But this brave Tibetan child was not afraid. He finally passed through the rebels' bullets and safely ran to the residence of the authorities and the barracks of the troops, reporting the situation of the rebels. Renqing Zhaxi's heroic behavior has been warmly praised by the people on the grassland.

Renqing Zhaxi is a student at Dingqing Primary School. He was born into a poor family, his parents died, and he used to make a living as a servant. After liberation, he got the opportunity to study and entered Dingqing Primary School. Under the education of the Party, Renqing Zhaxi has made rapid progress in all aspects. In 1956, he joined the Young Pioneers and served as the captain of the brigade. (Attached picture)

### 封建大山推倒了　幸福太阳升起了  西藏儿童跨进自由欢乐新天地  藏族少先队员仁青扎西英勇冲破封锁报告匪情

    封建大山推倒了　幸福太阳升起了
    西藏儿童跨进自由欢乐新天地
    藏族少先队员仁青扎西英勇冲破封锁报告匪情
    新华社拉萨31日电　原西藏地方反动政府被解散以后，西藏广大少年儿童结束了他们世代承袭的悲惨命运，开始过着自由欢乐的新生活。
    在拉萨、日喀则、昌都、山南、黑河等地，最近两月来入学的儿童普遍增加。拉萨叛乱平息不久，入学儿童就增加了一千五百多名，其中绝大部分是农奴的子弟和不久前还在到处流浪的孤儿。解放后开办的拉萨第一、第二两所小学，八年来学生从未满额，现在却容纳不了。自治区筹备委员会文教处新开办的第三小学在招生的头两天，报名的儿童就达六百名以上，筹委会不得不开始着手筹建第四小学。为了使广大适龄儿童都有机会学习文化，拉萨军管会最近又帮助各居民委员会，采用民办方式兴办了十九所文化学校。在山南地区，泽当小学在叛乱平息后入学儿童比叛乱前增加了两倍多。雅鲁藏布江边的桑日宗过去从来没有过学校，当地群众在军管会工作组帮助下，最近创办了第一所小学，使当地80％的学龄儿童都入了学。
    过去，农奴的子弟从出世第一天起就被记上农奴主的账簿，孩子的父母要被迫交纳“出生税”和“人头税”；年龄稍长，就得随父母一道去为主人背水、打柴、拾粪、放牧和负担其他繁重劳动，为主人支差。那时上学对这些穷孩子来说只不过是梦想，即使勉强能上学，又会遭到反动政权和头人的迫害。拉萨中学学生旺堆因为不顾头人的拦阻上了学，有一次被几个藏兵抓住扔进了泥塘，幸亏同学们赶来救出，才没有被淹死，但他的耳朵却被污水灌聋了。还有一个名叫阿旺嘉措的孩子，在上学途中被反动分子用刀刺伤了臂膀，半个多月不能动弹。许多孩子因为挟着学校的课本，佩带着红领巾，就遭到反动分子们的毒打。拉萨第一小学学生乌珠彭措、尼玛泽仁和格桑彭措，曾自己挖了一个秘密的地洞，放学时就把课本和红领巾藏进洞里。
    西藏叛乱基本平息以后，人民解放军各地军管会为改善儿童的生活条件做了许多工作。曾经流浪街头的儿童现在同自己的父母一道搬进了新居，生活贫困的孩子得到了救济，许多孩子被送进了学校。上学的孩子们可以无忧无虑地读书，可以自由地到林卡（林园）度过假日，再也不会有人来妨碍他们。西藏孩子们中间最近流行一首歌谣说：“噶厦坏透了，彻底消灭最好了，不再受打骂，不再支乌拉，封建大山推倒了，幸福的太阳升起了。”
    新华社拉萨31日电　在西藏北部草原上传颂着一个藏族少先队员英勇地冲过叛匪枪弹封锁，向人民解放军和当地机关报告匪情的事迹。这位少先队员名叫仁青扎西。
    事情发生在今年1月。那时在三十九族草原上，以呷日本为首的丁青地区的反动分子，正纠集匪众加紧策划向人民解放军驻丁青部队和地方机关进攻。1月24日早晨八时三十分，正当叛乱分子预定公开围攻我机关、部队之前半小时，仁青扎西得悉了这一情况，他急忙报告了人民解放军前哨部队的战士。但是，这时从前哨部队通到机关和部队住地的电话线已经被叛匪割断，无法取得联系，敌人封锁也很严密。在这重要关头，仁青扎西自报奋勇往机关去送信。他趁着一个手持大刀的叛匪走过去以后，机智而英勇地往机关住地跑去。他刚跑到桥头，就听枪声不断，这时丁青市区的叛匪已经开始围攻我守卫市区的部队了。叛匪看到了这个奔跑中的孩子，就残暴地对他射击。但这个英勇的藏族孩子并不畏惧，他终于在叛匪的枪弹中穿过去，安全跑到了机关住地和部队营房，报告了叛匪的情况。仁青扎西的英勇行为，受到了草原上人们热烈的称赞。
    仁青扎西是丁青小学的学生。他出生在一个贫苦家庭，父母双亡，过去靠当佣人为生。解放后，得到了学习机会，进入了丁青小学。在党的教育下，仁青扎西各方面进步很快，在1956年加入了少先队，并担任大队长的职务。（附图片）
