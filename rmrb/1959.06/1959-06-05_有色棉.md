Colored Cotton
By our reporter Cheng Hua

Cotton will soon be grown on balsam and hibiscus flowers.

Young ladies, would you believe that one day you will wear a pleated skirt that is not dyed but whose flowers will never fade?

This is neither anticipation nor fantasy.

In the agricultural experiment station of Yulin Prefecture, Guangxi, rows of pots containing new varieties of cultivated plants are neatly arranged. The place is lush green, with a few bright flowers dotting the landscape. Upon closer inspection, the pots planted with cotton have four vibrant balsam flowers blooming among the foot-high green branches and leaves. A spring rain has just passed, and a few drops of rainwater cling to the flowers, making them look even more beautiful and graceful. Jiang Shaofang, who is meticulously tending to the plants, squats beside the pots and tells the reporter: This new plant, grafted from cotton and balsam flowers, was grafted on April 1st.

The story is like this:

One day, the young breeder Jiang Shaofang was walking down the street when he suddenly noticed that the various colors of people's clothes, no matter how beautiful they were when new, would fade and look unsightly after being washed a few times. Jiang Shaofang wondered if there could be a kind of cloth that never faded and whose color would only improve with washing. He thought that cloth is woven from yarn, and yarn is spun from cotton. Wouldn't it be better if the cotton itself was colored? From then on, this young man, who was good at thinking and daring to create, decided to cultivate a kind of colored cotton. Jiang Shaofang pointed to the plant and said: Some people believe that grafting cotton and balsam flowers is a form of asexual distant hybridization and cannot produce hybrids. But I don't believe in this view, because colored cotton has been successfully grown in the Soviet Union. Why can they succeed, but we can't? Encouraged by the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, he conducted the experiment with full confidence. Because cotton has a woody stem and balsam flowers have a fleshy stem, he failed to graft them forty or fifty times in a row. At this time, he remembered the difficulties he had encountered when creating new varieties of rice, when he had felt like he was at "the end of the road with no hope in sight," but after studying it, he found a "new vista." Therefore, he did not lose heart and continued to explore new methods. Through trial and error, he selected young plants for grafting, and took extra care of them, observing them even in the middle of the night. If the water was not enough, he would water them immediately. If the wind was strong outside, he would immediately move them into a warm room. If he saw that there was not enough sunlight indoors, he would hurry to move them outdoors. Finally, he succeeded in grafting. Jiang Shaofang said: When harvest time comes, the cotton bolls on the branches will no longer be white, but colored cotton.

I and Jiang Shaofang walked through the newly built greenhouse of the experiment station. In a plot of land we passed, new cotton hybridized from hibiscus flowers and cotton grew luxuriantly. We walked side by side on the ridge of the field. When we talked about something exciting, he would grasp and shake my hand repeatedly. He said: Our people should not only eat well, but also dress well.

Jiang Shaofang, who is only twenty-two years old and has not graduated from junior high school, works hard day and night like this, constantly advancing on the road of scientific research. When he was a worker in the botanical garden of Yulin Normal School, he squeezed time from his busy schedule of miscellaneous tasks to study, learn, and experiment to cultivate fine varieties of rice. He overcame all kinds of difficulties in the experiment due to the lack of instruments and equipment. In the sixty-two failures and setbacks, the contempt and ridicule from the outside world also caused him distress and wavering from time to time. However, under the guidance and enthusiastic encouragement of the Party, the research work became more in-depth and meticulous, and he finally found the cause of the failures. In the sixty-third time, he successfully completed the grafting experiment of rice and corn, and cultivated the "corn rice" fine variety. He also used sexual hybridization of rice and sorghum to cultivate three fine varieties of rice, Yu Shi No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, negating the view in the agricultural science community that "distant hybridization" is difficult to succeed. At the same time, he also cultivated more than twenty new varieties such as "sorghum corn" and "multi-spike corn" using sexual hybridization and asexual hybridization. However, he is not satisfied with his existing achievements. Now, he has started new experiments. (Attached picture)

    有色棉
    本报记者　成华
    在凤仙花和芙蓉花上将要结出棉花来。
    你们将有一天穿上一种不经印染但是花儿永不褪色的折叠裙，年轻的姑娘们，你相信吗？
    这不是憧憬，也不是幻想。
    在广西玉林专区农业试验站里，排列着一行行众多的培育植物新品种的瓦盆，这些瓦盆里栽培着各种有趣的植物。这里一片翠绿，万绿丛中却有几朵鲜花。走近一看，栽棉花的盆里，尺把高的青枝绿叶之间，开着四朵鲜艳的凤仙花。刚刚下过一阵春雨，花朵上沾着几滴雨水，更显得美丽婀娜。正在精心护理的蒋少芳，蹲在瓦盆旁边，告诉记者：这株用棉花和凤仙花嫁接成的新植物，是在4月1日嫁接成的。
    事情原来是这样的：
    有一天，青年育种家蒋少芳走在街上，忽然发现人们穿的各种颜色的衣服，尽管新的时候它再漂亮，可是洗过几水以后颜色就褪的很难看。蒋少芳想，能不能有一种布，永不褪色，而且越洗颜色越好？他想，布是用纱织的，纱是棉花纺的，如果棉花本身就有颜色，那不更好吗？这个善于设想敢于创造的年青人，从此就打定主意要培育一种有色棉花。蒋少芳指着这株植物说：有些人认为棉花和凤仙花嫁接，是属于无性远缘杂交，不能得出杂种。可是我不相信这种见解，因为有色棉花已在苏联种植成功。为什么人家能试验成功，而我们不能呢？在苏联先进经验的鼓舞下，他信心百倍地进行试验。由于棉花是木质茎，凤仙花是肉质茎，一连嫁接了四、五十次都没有成功。这时，他想起在创造水稻新品种时，曾经遇到“山穷水尽疑无路”的困难，可是一经钻研，却又出现“柳暗花明又一村”的经验。因此他不灰心，继续在探索新的方法。在摸索中，他选出幼龄植株进行嫁接，同时倍加爱护，半夜三更也去观察，发现水不够了马上浇水，室外风大立即把它搬进暖室，看到室内阳光少了，赶忙把它搬到室外，终于嫁接成功。蒋少芳说：到收获时，枝上结的棉桃将不再是白色，而是有色的棉花了。
    我和蒋少芳穿过试验站新盖的暖房，在路过的一畦地里，又长满了芙蓉花和棉花杂交的新棉花。在田埂上，我们并排走着，谈到高兴之处，他就握紧并连连摇动着我的手。他说：我们的人民不仅应该吃得好，还要穿得好。
    初中没有毕业年方二十二岁的蒋少芳就是这样日日夜夜的奋发努力，在科学研究的道路上不断前进。他在玉林师范学校植物园当工人时，就从杂务缠身、终日繁忙之中挤时间钻研、学习、实验，培育水稻良种。他克服了实验中缺乏仪器用具的种种困难。在六十二次的失败和挫折中，来自客观的轻视和嘲笑，虽也使他时有苦恼和动摇。但在党的诱导和热情的鼓舞之下，研究工作愈做愈深入细致，终于找到了失败的原因。在第六十三次成功地完成了水稻和玉米的嫁接试验，培育出“玉米水稻”良种。并且用水稻和高粱进行有性杂交，培育出玉师一、二、三号三个水稻良种，否定了农业科学界认为“远缘杂交”难于成功的看法。同时，还用有性杂交和无性杂交培育成“高粱玉米”、“多穗玉米”等二十几种新品种。可是，他并不满足于已有的成就，现在，他又开始了新的试验。（附图片）
