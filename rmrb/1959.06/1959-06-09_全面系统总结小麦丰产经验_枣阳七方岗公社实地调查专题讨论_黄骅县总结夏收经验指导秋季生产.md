This newspaper reports from Wuhan on the 7th: The Qifanggang People's Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, before and after the wheat harvest, used a combination of field visits and investigations and thematic discussions, combined with cadres and the masses, to carefully summarize the high-yield wheat experience, creating conditions for a greater wheat harvest next year.

This year, the wheat in Qifanggang Commune grew better than in previous years. The Commune Party Committee attached great importance to this year's high-yield wheat experience. As early as mid-May, under the leadership of the Party Committee Secretary, it began to organize cadres and the masses to jointly summarize relevant experiences. In order to do this work well, the Party Committee decided to proceed in two stages: The first stage was to organize the main leading cadres of each management district and production team, as well as some high-yield models and experienced farmers, to visit the site. The task was, under the leadership of the Commune Party Committee, through visits, investigations, and thematic discussions of representative production teams and plots, to make preliminary summaries on key links in wheat production, such as sowing methods, sowing time, deep plowing, close planting, and fertilization. The second stage was to hand over this preliminary summary to each production team, organize cadres and the masses of each team to discuss it in light of their own team's circumstances, in order to absorb more opinions from cadres and the masses, make the summary more substantial and practical; and on this basis, study specific measures for sowing wheat this winter. The first stage began before the wheat harvest and ended in late May. The second stage is underway.

The actual results obtained have proved that this summary method is successful. It has educated both cadres and the masses, and strengthened their confidence in continuing to increase wheat production next year. For example, regarding the issue of deep plowing, some people in the past were ideologically unconvinced, believing that deep plowing would lead to reduced production. This time, after field visits, investigations, and special discussions on the issue of deep plowing, this understanding was changed. Facts show that those who deep-plowed and increased fertilizer application have greatly increased production. The Qifanggang Production Team has a fifteen-mu plot of hilly land that was only plowed three inches deep in previous years, with an average wheat yield of about one hundred catties per mu. Last winter, due to deep plowing to more than one foot and increased fertilizer application, the wheat grew very well this year. According to estimated yields, it can be increased by more than two times compared to last year. The Dengzhai Production Team has a seventeen-mu wheat field, of which eight mu were deep-plowed and nine mu were shallow-plowed. Other conditions being equal, the result was: the average yield of the eight mu was more than 40% higher than the nine mu. Everyone agreed that deep plowing has the benefits of preventing lodging, preventing waterlogging, reducing weeds, preserving moisture, and promoting large ears and full grains. Regarding the issues of sowing time and sowing density, after joint discussions by cadres and the masses, it was believed that attention should be paid to appropriateness and rationality. Too early, too late, too dense, or too sparse will all have adverse consequences. From a large amount of material obtained from field investigations, the ideal sowing period is from five days after the Cold Dew to the Frost's Descent period. However, everyone believes that in specific implementation, full attention should be paid to labor and climatic conditions: areas with insufficient labor should begin sowing around the Cold Dew; sometimes, in order to seize the soil moisture, sowing can also be appropriately advanced. As for sowing density, it is necessary to consider conditions such as geological conditions and varieties, generally about 30 catties per mu is better. In addition, relatively consistent understandings have also been reached through summaries on issues such as sowing methods, fertilizer application, and the use of improved varieties.

After this summary, cadres and the masses have a clearer understanding of the ways to increase wheat production, which is: to resolutely and correctly implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production. At present, cadres and the masses of each production team are full of confidence in continuing to increase wheat production next year. On the basis of the summary, they are further studying measures to increase wheat production next year and arranging relevant preparatory work.

This newspaper reports from Tianjin on the 8th: The CPC Huanghua County Committee summarized the experience of increasing wheat production, and strived to apply these experiences to summer planting and autumn field management in a timely manner, laying a good foundation for increasing grain production this autumn.

Since the beginning of summer, the Huanghua County Party Committee has adopted a working method that combines leadership and the masses. It has successively organized the Party Committee Secretaries, Management District Secretaries, Directors, Production Team Leaders, agricultural technicians, and experienced farmers of each commune to go deep into the fields of Yang'erzhuang, Chengguan, Nandagang, and Jiucheng Communes for visits, inspections, comparisons, and field meetings to summarize the experience of increasing wheat production. After inspection and comparison, it was affirmed that the main experiences of this year's wheat increase were "three goods and three ratiocinations," that is, the technique of deep plowing was well mastered, the quality of seeds should be well selected, and early sowing is better than late sowing; irrigation, fertilization, and dense planting must be reasonable. These experiences, especially the experiences of dense planting and early sowing, are of great guiding significance for the current summer planting, rice transplanting, and field management.

In order to better apply these experiences to summer planting and autumn field management, the county's leading departments held an on-site meeting in the Zhou Qingzhuang Management District of the Nandagang Commune. The meeting, in response to the paralysis of some masses and cadres in this management district regarding the early transplanting of rice this year, and the unclear bottom code of transplanting density, mobilized the masses to conduct discussions in conjunction with summarizing the high-yield wheat experience. First, everyone had a lively debate about whether this year's rice transplanting was better dense or sparse. For example, the Changguo Production Team of Jiucheng Commune had one hundred mu of wheat. The management measures were the same. Among them, seventy mu had a row spacing of four inches, each plant had four tillers, the ear length was 5.2 cm, and each ear had forty-four grains; the remaining thirty mu had a row spacing of six inches, the ear length was 2.8 cm, and each ear had twenty-seven grains. After laying out the facts, carefully calculating, and repeated comparison, the benefits of reasonable dense planting were affirmed. Everyone, with reference to the dense planting of wheat and the planting density of last year, determined that this year's rice fields should be transplanted with 20,000 to 25,000 plants per mu. Was it better to transplant rice early or late? The meeting also conducted a full airing and debate. Everyone cited the example of the eight mu of land in the Kou Village Production Brigade of Chengguan Commune. Four mu of wheat were planted in the White Dew and Autumn Equinox seasons, and the management conditions were the same, but the ears of the early planting were 5.1 cm long, and each ear had forty-three grains; the ears of the late planting were 4.3 cm long, and each ear had thirty-four grains. The discussion also compared the situations of more harvest for early rice transplanting and less harvest for late rice transplanting last year. The masses unanimously said that rice transplanting should begin now this year.

    全面系统总结小麦丰产经验
    枣阳七方岗公社实地调查专题讨论
    黄骅县总结夏收经验指导秋季生产
    本报武汉7日电　湖北省枣阳县七方岗人民公社在麦收前后，采
  用田间参观调查和专题讨论相结合、干部和群众相结合的方法，认真
  总结小麦丰产经验，为明年小麦的更大丰产创造条件。
    今年七方岗公社的小麦长得比往年好，公社党委对今年小麦丰产经验极为重视，早在5月中旬，就由党委书记挂帅，着手组织干部和群众共同来总结有关的经验。为了把这个工作抓好，党委决定分两个
  阶段来进行：第一阶段，组织各管理区、生产队的主要领导干部和一些丰产模范、老农去现场参观，任务是在公社党委的领导下，通过对有代表性的生产队和田块的参观、调查和专题讨论，就小麦生产
  的关键性的环节如播种方法、播种期、深耕、密植、施肥等，提出初步总结。第二阶段，把这个初步总结交各生产队，组织各队干部和群众结合本队情况展开讨论，以便吸取更多干部和群众的意见，使总结更加充实和切合实际；并在此基础上研究今冬播种小麦的具体措施。第一阶段在割麦前开始，已在5月下旬全部结束。第二阶段正在进行。
    已经获得的实际效果证明，这种总结方法是成功的，它使干部和群众都受到了很大的教育，增强了明年继续提高小麦产量的信心。如关于深耕问题，有的群众过去思想不通，认为深耕会造成减产，这次经过田间参观、调查并专门就深耕问题展开讨论后，把这种认识改变了。事实说明，凡是深耕并且增施了肥料的，都大大增产。七方岗生产队有块十五亩的岗地，历年只耕三寸深，平均亩产小麦一百斤左右；去冬由于深耕达一尺以上并增施了肥料后，今年小麦长得很好，据估算的产量，可比去年提高二倍以上。登寨生产队有块十七亩的麦田，其中八亩实行深耕，九亩实行浅耕，其它条件相同，结果是：八亩的平均单产比九亩高出四成以上。大家一致认为深耕有防倒伏、防涝、减少杂草、保墒和促使穗大粒饱的好处。关于播种期和播种密度问题，经干部和群众共同讨论后，认为应该注意适当和合理，过早、过晚和过密、过稀，都会造成不良的后果。从田间调查所获得的大量材料看，理想的播种期是寒露后五天到霜降这一段时期。但大家认为在具体执行时，要充分注意劳动力和气候条件：劳动力不足的地区，应在寒露左右就开始播种；有时为了抢住墒情，也可适当提早播种。至于播种密度，要考虑到地质和品种等条件，一般以每亩三十斤左右为好。此外，对播种方法、施肥量和良种使用等问题，也都通过总结得到了比较一致的认识。
    经过这次总结后，干部和群众对小麦增产的途径更加明确了，这就是：坚决地、正确地贯彻执行农业生产的“八字宪法”。目前，各生产队干部和群众对明年小麦继续增产满怀信心，他们正在总结的基础上，进一步研究明年小麦增产的措施和安排有关各项准备工作。

    本报天津8日电　中共河北省黄骅县委总结小麦增产经验，力求使这些经验及时运用到夏种和秋田管理方面，为今秋粮食增产打下了良好的基础。
    入夏以来，黄骅县委采用领导与群众相结合的工作方法，先后组织各公社党委书记、管理区书记、主任、生产队长、农业技术干部和老农，分别深入到羊二庄、城关、南大港、旧城公社田间地垅，参观检查评比，召开现场会议，总结小麦增产经验。经过检查评比，肯定了今年小麦增产的主要经验是“三好三合理”，即深翻土地技术掌握好，籽种质量要选好，早种比晚种好；浇水、施肥、密植一定要合理。这些经验，尤其是密植、早种的经验，对当前夏种、插秧、田间管理有着十分重要的指导意义。
    为了更好地将这些经验运用到夏种和秋田管理方面去，县的领导部门在南大港公社周青庄管理区召开了现场会议。会议针对这个管理区的部分群众和干部对今年稻田提前插秧存在着“时间尚早，不必着忙”的麻痹思想，以及对于插秧密度底码不清的情况，发动群众结合总结小麦丰产经验进行讨论。首先大家围绕着今年稻田插秧密了好还是稀了好的问题进行热烈的辩论。如旧城公社常郭生产队一百亩小麦，管理措施一样，其中七十亩行距四寸，每株分蘖四个，穗长五点二公分，每穗四十四个粒；其余三十亩行距六寸，穗长二点八公分，每穗二十七个粒。经过摆事实，算细账，反复对比，肯定了合理密植的益处。大家参照小麦密植的情况和去年插秧的密度，确定今年稻田每亩插秧两万墩至两万五千墩比较适宜。关于稻田插秧早了好，还是晚了好？会议也进行了充分的鸣放辩论。大家举出城关公社扣村生产大队的八亩地为例，白露和秋分季节各种了小麦四亩，经营管理条件一样，但早种的穗长五点一公分，每穗四十三个粒；晚种的穗长四点三公分，每穗三十四个粒。讨论中还对去年插秧早的多收、插秧晚的少收的情况作了对比。群众一致表示，今年插秧现在就应当开始。 　（杨复保）
