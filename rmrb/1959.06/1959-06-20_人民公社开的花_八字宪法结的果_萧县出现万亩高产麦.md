    Flowers Bloom in People's Communes, Fruit Ripens from the Eight-Character Constitution
    Bumper Wheat Harvest on Ten Thousand Mu in Xiao County
    Huangzang Commune achieves an average yield of over 820 Jin per mu on more than ten thousand mu of wheat.
    Xinhua News Agency reports that the provinces of Anhui, Henan, and Zhejiang have successively reported good harvests of wheat and barley over large areas.
    In Anhui Province, the Huangzang Commune in Xiao County achieved an average yield of 820 Jin and 5 Liang per mu on 10,141.7 mu of wheat, with 705 mu yielding between 1,000 Jin and 1,515 Jin per mu.
    In Henan Province, the Baihe Brigade of the Baihe Commune in Mengjin County achieved an average yield of 717 Jin per mu on 1,036 mu of wheat; the Kongzhongguo Brigade of the Kongzhongguo Commune in Yancheng County achieved an average yield of 1,043 Jin and 9 Liang per mu on 11.4 mu of wheat.
    In Zhejiang Province, the Lujiazhi Production Team of the Shenjiamen Commune in Zhoushan County achieved an average yield of 1,041 Jin and a half per mu on 10.118 mu of barley.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 19th: The Huangzang People's Commune in Xiao County, Anhui Province, has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest with an average yield of 820 Jin and 5 Liang per mu on 10,141.7 mu of wheat.
    The Huangzang People's Commune planted over 60,000 mu of wheat this year, with over 30,000 mu of better wheat already threshed. This 10,141.7 mu of high-yield land is part of it. Among this over 10,000 mu of wheat, 3,471.7 mu were planted with wheat alone, and 6,670 mu were intercropped with peas (peas accounting for 25%).
    In the wheat fields planted with wheat alone, 7.98 mu of wheat yielded an average of 2,448 Jin and a half per mu, 3.8 mu of wheat yielded an average of 2,242 Jin and a half per mu, and 705 mu of wheat yielded an average of 1,000 Jin to 1,515 Jin per mu.
    In the wheat fields intercropped with beans, 3.8 mu of wheat yielded over 2,000 Jin per mu, and 89.2 mu of wheat yielded between 1,000 Jin and 1,572 Jin per mu.
    In the Huangzang People's Commune area, the wheat yield per mu before liberation was only 50 or 60 Jin. In addition to political reasons, the area is surrounded by mountains, with a lot of silted fields, severe soil erosion, and frequent attacks by mountain floods and droughts, so it was basically a poor, low-yield area.
    In the years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, this place has carried out soil and water conservation, afforestation, and water conservancy construction, so that production has gradually increased year by year. In 1957, the wheat yield per mu was 147 Jin. In 1958, although it suffered severe wind and pest and disease disasters, the average wheat yield per mu was still 125 Jin, with better yields reaching 200 to 300 Jin. This exceeds four to five times that before liberation. This year, the first summer harvest after the establishment of the People's Commune, the yield per unit area on a large area of land has exceeded ten times that before liberation. The superiority of socialism and the superiority of the People's Commune have radiated brilliantly here.
    The bumper harvest of the Huangzang People's Commune is the result of implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. Before sowing wheat in the autumn of 1958, the entire commune, after more than a year of large-scale water conservancy construction, built contour lines and fish-scale pits on the mountains, and built reservoirs. At the foot of the mountains, canals and dams were built to renovate the Daoliu River, which runs through the commune from north to south, so that it can be irrigated by gravity flow, making the entire commune's land basically unafraid of drought and flood disasters.
    Last autumn, when sowing wheat and after sowing wheat, the People's Commune also carried out unprecedented major reforms in cultivation and field management. In the past, the wheat fields here were only ploughed to a depth of five or six inches, and only fourteen or fifteen Jin of seeds were sown per mu, with little base fertilizer and little top dressing, and there was no habit of irrigating wheat. From sowing to harvest, weeding was only done once or twice. However, last autumn, the entire commune used improved deep ploughs to plough to a depth of more than eight inches, and the high-yield fields were ploughed even deeper. The base fertilizer was increased a lot compared to the past; the amount of seeds sown was also increased to implement moderate close planting; all wheat seeds were selected from Bima No. 1 improved varieties. During the wheat growing period, the entire commune fixed professional cadres and organized professional teams to strengthen field management, and universally implemented winter irrigation and spring irrigation. When passing the regreening and jointing stages, the Party committees of the commune and the Party branches of the teams especially strengthened the manpower for field management, implemented a system of assigning quality and quantity to each person, assigning responsibilities, and accepting inspections every ten days. Because the Party Committee of the commune and the Party organizations of the teams grasped the ideological education work of the masses tightly and grasped the inspection of wheat fields tightly, the entire commune's enthusiasm for striving for a bumper wheat harvest this year has been very high, and the wheat field management work has not been relaxed.

    人民公社开的花　八字宪法结的果
    萧县出现万亩高产麦
    皇藏公社一万多亩小麦平均亩产八百二十斤多
    据新华社讯　安徽、河南和浙江各省相继传来小麦和大麦大面积丰收喜报。
    安徽省萧县皇藏公社一万零一百四十一亩七分小麦，平均亩产八百二十斤五两，其中七百零五亩亩产一千斤到一千五百一十五斤。
    河南省孟津县白合公社白合大队一千零三十六亩小麦，平均亩产七百一十七斤；郾城县空冢郭公社空冢郭大队十一亩四分小麦，平均亩产一千零四十三斤九两。
    浙江省舟山县沈家门公社鲁家峙生产队十亩一分八厘大麦，平均亩产一千零四十一斤半。
    据新华社合肥19日电　安徽省萧县皇藏人民公社一万零一百四十一亩七分小麦，平均亩产量达到八百二十斤五两，获得了大面积丰收。
    皇藏人民公社今年共种小麦六万多亩，有三万多亩较好的小麦已经脱粒，这一万零一百四十一亩七分高产地，就是其中的一部分。在这一万多亩小麦中，单种小麦的有三千四百七十一亩七分，同豌豆混种的有六千六百七十亩（豌豆占25％）。
    在单种小麦的麦田中，有七亩九分八厘小麦平均亩产二千四百四十八斤半，有三亩八分小麦平均亩产二千二百四十二斤半，有七百零五亩小麦平均亩产一千斤到一千五百一十五斤。
    豆麦混种的麦田中，有三亩八分小麦平均亩产二千斤以上，有八十九亩二分小麦平均亩产一千斤到一千五百七十二斤。
    皇藏人民公社地区，解放前小麦亩产量只有五、六十斤。除了政治的原因而外，还由于该地四面环山，淤田较多，水土流失严重，经常遭受山洪和旱灾的侵袭，因此基本上是贫瘠的低产之区。
    解放后几年来，在党和人民政府领导下，这个地方进行了水土保持，植树造林，兴修水利，使产量逐年有所提高。1957年小麦亩产一百四十七斤。1958年虽然遭受严重的风灾和病虫灾害，小麦平均每亩仍产一百二十五斤，较好的达到两三百斤。这就超过了解放前的四倍到五倍之多。今年，人民公社成立后的第一个夏收，在大面积的土地上，单位面积产量超过了解放前的十几倍。社会主义的优越性，人民公社的优越性，在这里放出了灿烂的光辉。
    皇藏人民公社的丰收，是贯彻执行“八字宪法”的结果。1958年秋季种麦以前，全社经过一年多来的大兴水利，山上普遍筑了等高线、鱼鳞坑，修了水库，山下开渠筑坝，把贯串全社南北的倒流河整修得能节节自流灌溉，做到了全社土地基本不怕旱涝灾害。
    去秋种麦和种麦以后，人民公社又在耕种和田间管理工作中进行了空前的重大改革。这里往年的麦田只耕五、六寸深，每亩只下种十四、五斤，施基肥少，追肥也少，没有浇灌小麦的习惯，从种到收只锄草一次到二次；可是去年秋天，全社用改良的深耕犁普遍耕到八寸以上，丰产田耕得更深。基肥比过去增加很多；并增加了下种量实行适度的密植；麦种全部选用碧蚂一号良种。小麦生长期间，全社固定有专业干部和组织有专业队来加强田间管理工作，普遍实行了冬灌和春灌。在过返青、拔节等关时，公社各生产队又特别加强了田间管理的人力，实行了按人定质定量，分工负责管理，十天一验收等制度。由于公社党委会和各队党组织对群众的思想教育工作抓得紧，对麦田的检查抓得紧，全社对争取今年小麦丰收的干劲一直很高，麦田管理工作一直没有放松。
