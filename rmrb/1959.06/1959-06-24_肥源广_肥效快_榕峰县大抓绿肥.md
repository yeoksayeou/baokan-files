Wide Source of Fertilizer, Quick Effect
    Rongfeng County Vigorously Develops Green Manure

(According to Yunnan Daily) After agricultural work in Rongfeng County, Yunnan Province, shifted to mid-season cultivation, the county quickly launched a campaign to accumulate green manure on a large scale. As of now, the county has accumulated more than 34.19 million loads of various green manures, averaging 50 loads per mu of land.

The mid-season cultivation and summer weeding campaign in Rongfeng County has been fully launched. The county plans to top-dress corn twice universally, and to top-dress more than 50% of the large-area high-yield land three times; to top-dress rice once or twice, and flue-cured tobacco two to four times, totaling 74 million loads of fertilizer needed. According to inspection, the county currently has only 14.1 million loads of fertilizer, accounting for only 19% of the required amount; only about 10% of the county's 92,000 large manure ponds are full; many livestock pens are also empty. Based on this situation, the Rongfeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan of fighting a decisive battle for fertilizer and seizing a bumper harvest, and quickly launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign centered on accumulating green manure throughout the county. Touzhai Commune summarized the advantages of green manure as having wide sources, large quantities, high quality, and quick effects. The entire commune immediately arranged for 1,700 people to rush up the mountains to accumulate green manure.

During the green manure accumulation campaign, various localities adopted methods such as cutting, soaking, steeping, piling, and padding to accumulate and create fertilizer, and widely accumulated fertilizer. Cuihua Commune opened 51 green manure accumulation sites and 21 lime sites, adopting the method of accumulating on the spot, soaking on the spot, piling on the spot, and applying on the spot, which greatly accelerated the speed of green manure accumulation.

    肥源广  肥效快
    榕峰县大抓绿肥
    据云南日报消息　云南榕峰县农活转入中耕后，迅速开展了大积绿肥的活动。到目前为止，全县已积得各种绿肥三千四百一十九万多背，平均每亩田地有五十背。
    榕峰县中耕夏锄运动已经全面展开。全县计划包谷普遍追肥两道，50％以上的大面积丰产地追肥三道，水稻追一至二道，烤烟追二至四道，总计共需肥七千四百万背。据检查，全县现有肥料只一千四百一十万背，仅占需肥数的19％；全县九万二千个大粪塘，满的只有10％左右；不少畜厩也是空的。中共榕峰县委根据这一情况，提出大战肥料关，夺取大丰收的口号，在全县范围内迅速掀起了以积绿肥为中心的积肥运动。头寨公社总结了绿肥肥源广、数量多、质量高、肥效快等好处，全社立即安排了一千七百多人，上山突击积绿肥。
    在积肥突击运动中，各地采取割、沤、泡、堆、垫等积肥造肥的办法，广积肥料。翠华公社开辟了五十一个积绿肥的工地和二十一个石灰工地，采取就地积、就地泡、就地堆、就地施的办法，积绿肥速度大大加快。
