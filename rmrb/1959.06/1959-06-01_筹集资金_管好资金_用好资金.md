Xinhua News Agency, May 31st. The National Branch Directors Conference of the People's Bank of China, recently held in Beijing, determined that this year's financial tasks are: to strive to raise funds, manage and use working capital well, and to struggle to complete this year's national economic plan.

The meeting believed that the following measures should be taken to accomplish this task:

First, strengthen the management of working capital of state-owned enterprises. With the development of the increase production and practice economy movement in various economic sectors, banks should actively support enterprises in completing their production plans and commodity circulation plans, and at the same time assist enterprises in strengthening economic accounting and rational use of funds. The use of enterprise working capital must adhere to three principles: working capital and capital construction investment should be managed separately, and working capital cannot be used for capital construction; working capital cannot be used for advance payments for goods or commodity sales on credit, but must be money out, goods back in, goods out, money back in, and working capital must be used according to plan, implementing the spirit of "the whole country as a single chessboard."

The meeting requested that banks at all levels, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, rely on the masses, and closely cooperate with finance departments and enterprise management departments to jointly manage working capital well.

Second, support the great leap forward in agricultural production and the consolidation and improvement of people's communes. The meeting requested that banks at all levels thoroughly understand the situation of rural funds and material supply, assist the Party committee in properly arranging rural funds, and make overall considerations and unified arrangements for the use of existing agricultural loans, state investment in communes, advance purchase deposits, and communes' own funds. More support should be given to communes and production teams with poorer economic foundations. While supporting communes in developing agricultural production, they should also assist communes in diversifying their operations and increasing cash income.

Third, vigorously carry out urban and rural people's savings work, accumulate funds, and regulate social purchasing power. After analyzing the favorable conditions for carrying out savings work this year, the meeting believed that as long as banks further strengthen publicity, continue to improve service quality, and conscientiously implement the principle of "voluntary deposit, free withdrawal," savings deposits can be increased this year.

Fourth, establish and improve rules and regulations so that the rules and regulations can both ensure the implementation of national policies and facilitate enterprises and the masses. If new rules and regulations cannot be established for the time being, appropriate modifications can be made on the basis of the old rules and regulations.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's financial tasks, the meeting requested all financial cadres to continue to exert their efforts and launch a thorough and lasting competition movement within the banking system.

The meeting also decided to confer the glorious title of "National Financial Model Worker" on Xu Xuehui, a female accountant of the Ruili County People's Bank of Yunnan Province, who bravely protected state property, and called on all financial cadres to learn from Xu Xuehui's excellent qualities.

This meeting was held from May 12th to 25th. During the meeting, Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the meeting and gave important instructions.

    筹集资金　管好资金　用好资金
    人民银行确定今年金融工作任务：加强对国营企业流动资金管理；支援农业大跃进；开展城乡储蓄业务；建立健全规章制度
    新华社31日讯　最近在北京举行的中国人民银行全国分行行长会议确定今年金融工作的任务是：努力筹集资金，管好用好流动资金，为完成今年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    会议认为应当采取以下几项措施来完成这一任务：
    第一、加强对国营企业流动资金的管理。随着各经济部门增产节约运动的开展，银行应当积极支持各个企业完成生产计划和商品流转计划，同时协助企业加强经济核算，合理使用资金。企业流动资金的使用要坚持三个原则，即：流动资金与基本建设投资分别管理，流动资金不能用于基本建设；流动资金不能用于预付货款和商品赊销，必须是钱出去货回来，货出去钱回来，流动资金必须按计划使用，贯彻“全国一盘棋”的精神。
    会议要求各级银行在当地党委统一领导下，依靠群众，和财政部门、企业主管部门密切协作，共同管好流动资金。
    第二、支持农业生产大跃进和人民公社的巩固和提高。会议要求各级银行深入了解农村资金和物资供应情况，协助党委妥善安排农村资金，对现有农贷、国家向公社的投资款和预购定金以及公社自有资金，通盘考虑，统一安排使用。对于经济基础较差的公社和生产队，应当给予较多的支援，在支援公社发展农业生产的同时，要协助公社进行多种经营，增加现金收入。
    第三、大力开展城乡人民储蓄工作，积聚资金，调节社会购买力。会议分析了今年开展储蓄工作的有利条件后，认为银行只要进一步加强宣传工作，继续改善服务质量，切实执行“存款自愿、取款自由”的原则，今年储蓄存款是可以增加的。
    第四、建立和健全规章制度，使规章制度既能保证国家政策的贯彻，又能便利企业和群众。新的规章制度一时建立不起来的，可以在旧的规章制度的基础上加以适当修改。
    为了保证今年金融工作任务的完成，会议要求全体金融工作干部继续鼓足干劲，在银行系统内开展一个深入的持久的竞赛运动。
    会议还决定授予奋不顾身保护国家财产的云南省瑞丽县人民银行女会计员徐学惠以“全国金融模范工作者”的光荣称号，并且号召全体金融工作干部学习徐学惠的优良品质。
    这次会议是从5月12日到25日举行的。会议期间，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念曾到会作了重要指示。
