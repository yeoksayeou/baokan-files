    The Lesson of Britain
    By Pan Fei, Staff Reporter
    The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has adjourned. Regarding the assessment of this conference and the next stage of East-West talks, the leaders of the US and British governments have expressed different opinions.

    British Prime Minister Macmillan said in the House of Commons on the 23rd that although the Foreign Ministers' Conference did not reach an agreement, "there is no doubt that the attitudes of both sides have been further clarified. In some respects, they are closer. It is for this reason that I hope that after a short adjournment, they will be able to make further progress." In Macmillan's view—regardless of his starting point—the convening of an East-West summit meeting is inevitable and unavoidable. He said: "It is hoped that the Foreign Ministers' Conference, scheduled to reconvene in Geneva on July 13, will lead to a meeting of heads of government."

    On the 24th, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd gave a report in the House of Commons. Although Lloyd euphemistically tried to shift the responsibility for the conference's failure to reach an agreement onto the Soviet Union, he could not help but admit that the Soviet government's proposals were realistic and that the Soviet delegation was in a spirit of consultation. He said: "Mr. Gromyko even said that some of the proposals in our proposals are acceptable. I am also willing to say that there are some factors in his draft treaty that we do not object to." Lloyd then said: "I don't think the conference has broken down in any sense."

    In Washington, both Eisenhower and Herter sang a different tune. At a press conference on the 17th, the US President described the Foreign Ministers' Conference as "unfortunate" and "not showing greater hope." Eisenhower concluded that if the Foreign Ministers' Conference had not done its "preparatory work" and had not achieved "necessary progress," the convening of a summit meeting was impossible.

    There is no doubt that the views of the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary are more realistic than those of the US President and Secretary of State. The impression one gets is that when Macmillan and Lloyd made speeches in the House of Commons, their assessment of the situation was more realistic, just as it was when they visited Moscow four months ago. At that time, the British Prime Minister, regardless of opposition from Washington and Bonn, held talks with the Soviet government leaders and put forward some proposals that aroused interest or attention in various quarters. In the Soviet-British joint communiqué, one can see that on some issues, the opinions of Britain and the Soviet Union have a certain degree of commonality. However, before long, Britain's attitude became blurred—or rather, constantly retreated. Especially during the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Britain had almost completely abandoned some of its original proposals.

    What were the results of Britain doing this? The result was that it weakened Britain's international position and influence. At the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the policy line guiding the Western countries was the United States and West Germany. The British representative played an extremely inconspicuous "extra" role.

    During the period before and after the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the vacillation of British foreign policy was most evident. Perhaps Britain believes that this is its "flexibility" in handling international affairs. In fact, this is precisely a reflection of Britain's weakness. This weakness is ultimately because British foreign policy is based on irreconcilable contradictions. On the issue of peace and war, Britain fears the outbreak of a new world war (because such a war would inevitably destroy the British Empire), but at the same time it fears a genuine and significant relaxation of the international situation. In its relations with the United States, Britain on the one hand hopes to rely on American "aid" to save the declining British Empire, but on the other hand it is unwilling to be eroded by the United States and often shows a little independence towards the United States. In its relations with West Germany, Britain on the one hand cooperates with the United States in implementing the policy of rearming West Germany, but on the other hand it fears West Germany's strength and cannot suppress West Germany. The result of implementing this policy is often that Britain itself suffers. For example, West Germany is now powerful and does not take Britain seriously at all. According to the "Times" report on the 23rd, Adenauer advocated convening a summit meeting of the four Western countries to force Britain to act according to the line formulated by Bonn. According to Adenauer, "When people belong to an alliance, they must give up some of their own主張 (zhǔzhāng - assertions/opinions)."

    "Where is Britain going?" This is an old question. Because Britain is often in a state of hesitation and bewilderment. If Britain really wants to maintain its international position as a major power, then it should first learn a lesson from this Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    英国的教训
    本报记者　潘非
    日内瓦外长会议已经休会。对于这次会议的估计，对于下一阶段的东西方会谈，美国和英国政府的领导人表示了不同的意见。
    英国首相麦克米伦23日在下院说，外长会议虽然没有达成协议，“但是毫无疑问双方的态度进一步得到了澄清。在某些方面更靠近了一些。正是由于这个原因，我希望在短期休会以后，他们将能取得进一步的进展。”在麦克米伦看来——不管他的出发点如何——东西方最高级会议的召开是必然的，不可避免的。他说：“希望定于7月13日在日内瓦复会的外长会议将导致举行政府首脑会议。”
    24日，英国外交大臣劳埃德在下院作了报告。劳埃德虽然婉转地想把会议没有达成协议的责任推到苏联身上，但是他又不能不承认：苏联政府的建议是现实的，苏联代表团是具有协商精神的。他说：“葛罗米柯先生甚至说，在我们的建议中有某些主张是可以接受的。我也愿意说，在他的和约草案中，有某些因素也是我们没有异议的。”劳埃德接着说：“我认为，不论从哪个意义上说，会议都没有破裂。”
    在华盛顿，不论是艾森豪威尔也好，赫脱也好，都唱着另外一种调子。在17日的记者招待会上，美国总统把外长会议描绘成“不幸的”，“没有出现更大希望的”。艾森豪威尔由此得出的结论是：如果外长会议没有作好“准备工作”，没有获得“必要的进展”，最高级会议的召开是不可能的。
    毫无疑问，英国首相和外交大臣的观点，要比美国总统和国务卿的观点现实得多。人们得到的印象是：麦克米伦和劳埃德在下院发表谈话时，他们对局势的估计是比较现实的，如同他们在四个月以前访问莫斯科的时候一样。当时，英国首相不顾来自华盛顿和波恩的反对，同苏联政府领导人进行了会谈并提出了一些引起各方面发生兴趣或注意的建议。在苏英会谈公报中，人们可以看到在若干问题上，英国和苏联的意见有着一定程度的共同点。但是，过不了多久，英国的态度便模糊起来，——确切地说，是不断向后退缩。特别是在外长会议期间，英国已几乎完全放下了原先的一些建议。
    英国这样做的结果是什么呢？结果是，削弱了英国的国际地位和影响。在外长会议上，指导西方国家的政策路线的，是美国和西德。英国代表充当了极不令人注意的“龙套”角色。
    在外长会议前后这段时期中，英国外交政策的摇摆不定，表现得最为明显不过了。也许，英国认为这是它在处理国际事务中的“灵活性”。事实上，这正是反映了英国的软弱。这种软弱，归根到底是因为英国的外交政策是建立在不可调和的矛盾的基础上面的。在和平和战争问题上，英国害怕新的世界战争的爆发（因为这样一次战争必然会使英帝国毁灭），但同时又害怕国际局势有真正的、重大的缓和。在同美国的关系上，英国一方面指望依靠美国的“援助”来挽救没落中的大英帝国，但同时又不甘心被美国侵蚀，而常常向美国闹一点独立性。在对西德的关系上，英国一方面协同美国执行着重新武装西德的政策，但同时又害怕西德强大，没法压抑西德。执行这种政策的结果，常常是英国自己吃亏。例如，西德现在已声势赫赫，根本不把英国看在眼里。根据23日的“泰晤士报”报道，阿登纳主张召开西方四国的首脑会议，迫使英国依照波恩制定的路线行事。按照阿登纳的说法就是：“当人们属于一个联盟的时候，他必须放弃某些自己的主张。”
    “英国向何处去？”这已是一个老问题。因为英国常常处于徘徊和徬徨的情况中。如果英国真的想保持自己作为一个大国的国际地位的话，那么，它应该首先从这次外长会议中吸取教训。
