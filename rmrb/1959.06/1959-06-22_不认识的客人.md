	An Unfamiliar Guest
	Hu Yixiao
	Around noon, I was resting when the communications officer, Xiao Wu, came to tell me that an old man was looking for me. I hurriedly ran to the office. The office was locked; a chair was placed in front of the door, probably for the old man to sit on, but now the chair was empty, and the person was nowhere to be found. I unlocked the office and sat inside waiting for a while, but no one came; so I went out of the office and strolled along the corridor. As I walked past a classroom, I heard voices talking: "Hold tight! Hold tight! Don't let go..." Followed by a series of clanging sounds. I walked into the classroom and found several students and a worker-like person surrounding the windowsill, repairing the window. The person was facing away from me, wearing a work uniform stained with oil, and holding a wrench in his hand, fastening an iron ring to the window panel that had come loose from the windowsill. It wasn't until the elementary school students said, "The principal is here," that he looked up. Only then did I see clearly that he was an elderly man, his hair and beard already white, but his face was rosy and full of energy. He quickly said, "Comrade Principal, I'm the one looking for you. But please wait a moment, I'll talk to you after I finish this iron ring."

	As we walked towards the office, he said to me: "These little fellows are really interesting. When they saw me holding a wrench and wearing a worker's uniform, they asked if I was here to fix the windows. Really interesting..." Once in the office, he said he wanted to talk to me about something, but couldn't find the right time, so he took advantage of the break before work to chat with me.

	The thing he talked about was truly unexpected! It turned out that three days ago, the old man's youngest son read him a passage from the newspaper, saying that a student at Hubin Elementary School wanted to be a steelworker when he grew up, so he didn't study hard. He felt that being a steelworker only required strength and not education. So he was always skipping classes, and mostly got two points on tests. The old man thought at the time that Hubin Elementary School was very close to the factory, and he could go to learn more about the situation; then he thought, the teachers are in charge of the children, and if the teachers couldn't do anything, what could he do? But then he thought, he was a worker, and since the child didn't study hard because he wanted to be a worker, he had a responsibility to take care of this matter. So he came to Hubin Elementary School - here to our school. When he said this, my face couldn't help but blush. The child he was talking about was Liu Ping from the fifth grade. Due to long-term family influence, this child mistakenly believed that as long as one did well in labor, it didn't matter whether one studied well or not. Teachers and classmates had tried many ways to help him, but with little effect. A Young Pioneer in their class wrote a letter to the newspaper about this matter, and the newspaper published it. I told him about the situation and thanked him for his concern, asking for his help. He said he wanted to meet Liu Ping.

	Liu Ping came and sat down across from me with great embarrassment. The old worker asked him a few questions and then started talking to him very warmly. The old man told Liu Ping that when he was eight years old, his father died, and his mother had no way to support him, so she had him work as a cowherd for someone. The cowherd could only eat a little leftover porridge and rice, and not even enough to fill his stomach. In the hot weather, he only wore a pair of torn pants, and in the cold weather, his jacket was made of broken hemp cloth wrapped with reed catkins. And that's not to mention that the landlord would whip him for herding cows at the slightest provocation, leaving him covered in blood. At that time, it was hard enough to save his life, let alone be able to study like the children today. As he spoke, I saw the old worker's eyes filled with tears. Children's hearts are easily moved, and as Liu Ping listened, he also began to cry. After the old worker finished telling his life story, he took two sips of tea, took out a piece of chalk, drew a lathe tool on the ground, and continued to speak. He said: "Child, don't think that being a worker doesn't require education, because being a worker does require education. Technology is a complicated thing. The year before last, our factory had a red flag competition. At that time, I was a lathe operator, and my opponent was an apprentice who had just come out from under my wing. Logically, the apprentice's skill should not be as good as the master's, right? But that kid was a junior high school graduate. He saw an advanced experience in a technical book and ground the angle of the lathe tool according to what it said in the book. He machined it quickly and well, and as a result, I was left behind. After that, I made up my mind to study culture and have been studying for three years now. I can understand most books now." As he said this, he grabbed the book "Malayev at School and at Home" from my desk and began to read it aloud. He read a passage and read it very well, without mispronouncing a single word. Then he said to me: "Principal! It's getting late, and I have to go to work. On Sunday, I will ask my youngest son to come. You let Liu Ping go to my house with him, and I will have a good talk with him again. ..."

	The old worker left. I opened the window, watched his figure gradually walking away in the spring sunshine, stroked Liu Ping's head, and felt many emotions in my heart, but for a moment, I didn't know what to say.

    不认识的客人
    胡忆肖
    中午时分，我正在休息，通讯员小吴来对我说，有一个老头找我。我急急忙忙地跑到办公室。办公室是锁着的；门口摆了一张椅子，大概是小吴给那位老头坐的；可是现在椅子空着，人不知上那儿去了。我开了锁，坐在办公室里等了一会，还不见有人来；于是就走出办公室，沿着走廊散步。当我走到一个教室旁边时，那里传来了谈话声：“扶紧！扶紧！别放松……”跟着，就听到一阵当当的敲击声。我走到教室里，发现几个学生和一个工人模样的人，正围在窗台上修理窗户。那个人背对着我，穿一身油渍斑斑的工作服，手里拿着一只搬手，正在把那和窗台脱离了的窗板，给安上一道铁环环扣住。直到小学生们说：“校长来了”，他才抬起头来。这时，我才看清他是个老年人，头发和胡子已经花白，不过脸上倒是红光闪闪，蛮有精神。他连忙说：“校长同志，是我找您。不过请您等等，这个铁环搞好了，我就跟您谈。”
    当我们走向办公室的时候，他对我说：“这些小家伙真有意思。他们看见我手里拿着搬手，又穿着工人服，便问我是不是来修窗户的。真有意思……”到了办公室，他说，有件事想找我谈谈，可是又找不到恰当的时间，所以就趁上班前的空隙，找我聊一聊。
    他谈出来的事情，真使人意想不到！原来三天前，老头的小儿子给他念了一段报纸，说是湖滨小学有个学生，长大了想要做个炼钢工人，因此他就不好好读书。他觉得，当炼钢工人只要有力气就行，不需要文化。所以他老是旷课，考起来也多是两分。老头当时就想，湖滨小学离工厂很近，可以去了解了解；他又想，人家老师是专管孩子的，老师都没有办法，他有什么办法呢？不过他又想，他是一个工人，既然那孩子为了想当个工人才不好好学习，那他就有责任管这件事。于是他就到湖滨小学——我们这儿来了。经他这一说，我的脸不禁红了。他所说的这个孩子，是五年级的刘平。由于家庭的长期影响，使这孩子错误地认为，只要劳动好就行，学习好不好没有关系。老师和同学们想了很多方法帮助他，但是效果不大。他们班有个少先队员，把这事写了封信给报社，报纸登出来了。我把情况向他谈了，并谢谢他的关心，要求他给予帮助。他说他想跟刘平见见面。
    刘平来了，很不好意思地在我对面坐下。老工人问了他一阵，便很亲热地和他谈开了。老头告诉刘平，自己八岁的时候，父亲就死了，母亲没办有法养活他，就让他给人放牛。放牛的孩子只能吃一点残粥剩饭，还吃不饱，穿的呢，热天只有一条破裤子，冷天的袄子是破麻布包一层芦花。这还不说，东家动不动就用放牛的鞭子抽他，抽得浑身都是血迹。那时候，性命都难保住，更别说能像现在的孩子这样读书。讲着，讲着，我看见老工人的眼里，充满了泪水。孩子的心是容易感动的，听着，听着，刘平也哭起来了。老工人讲完了他的身世，喝了两口茶，掏出一段粉笔，在地上画了一把车刀，继续讲他的。他说：“孩子，你别以为当工人不需要文化，其实当工人就是需要文化。技术这玩艺，是个复杂的东西。大前年，我们厂搞红旗竞赛，那时我是个车工，我的对手是刚从我手下出去的徒弟；论理，徒弟的技术总赶不上师傅吧？可是那孩子是个初中毕业生，他从技术书上看到一条先进经验，把车刀的角度照那上面说的磨了一下，车起来又快又好，结果我被抛在后面。打这以后，我就下决心学习文化，一直学了三年，现在一般的书都能看懂了。”说到这里，他就从我桌上抓起那本“马列耶夫在学校和家里”，大声地念起来。他念了一段，念得很好，一个字也没念错。接着他又对我说：“校长！时候不早了，我还要上班。星期天我就叫我的小儿子来，你让刘平和他一起到我家去，我再和他好好谈一谈。……”
    老工人走了。我推开窗户，望着他那在春天的阳光下渐渐走远了的背影，摸着刘平的头，心里有许多感触，可是一下子也不知道说什么好。
