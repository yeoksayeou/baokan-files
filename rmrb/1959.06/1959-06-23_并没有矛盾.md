　　There is No Contradiction
　　U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Satterthwaite, recently made a statement in the capital of the Congo. He said that Europeans often accuse the United States of "opposing" European colonialism, while Africans often accuse the United States of supporting its allies in suppressing African freedom. It seems that the U.S. policy towards Africa is contradictory. "However, I believe our attitude is clear, and there is no contradiction in our policy."
　　Satterthwaite announced that the U.S. policy is to "support" "all countries" "demanding independence," but with conditions. What conditions? First, these countries must be "able to assume the responsibility of independence"; second, these countries must be able to "evolve in an orderly and peaceful manner" when striving for independence; and third, these countries must "occupy their due position in the free world."
　　The beauty of this statement lies in the fact that it is originally a pie in the sky, used to deceive people, but as it is drawn, even the pie is cancelled out: the conditions for supporting "independence" negate "independence" itself! First of all, in the eyes of colonialists, the people of the colonies are "ignorant and ignorant," "lack political experience," and "cannot manage the country," and therefore they cannot "assume the responsibility of independence." Therefore, according to Satterthwaite's first condition, all African colonial people should not be independent. Secondly, in the eyes of the colonialists, their colonial rule and system are sacred and inviolable "order." Therefore, according to Satterthwaite's second condition, all African colonial people should not be independent either. Finally, even if they get rid of the colonial rule of the old European colonial countries, they cannot achieve independence, because according to Satterthwaite's third condition, these countries must also join the so-called "free world," in other words, they must be incorporated into the American colonial empire.
　　Indeed, the U.S. policy towards Africa is very "clear" and there is no contradiction. It helps European colonial countries suppress African national independence movements in order to expand its own power; it uses the banner of anti-colonialism to "oppose" the colonialism of European colonial countries, also in order to expand its own power. In a word, this is American neo-colonialism.

    并没有矛盾
    美国负责非洲事务助理国务卿萨脱斯威特最近在刚果首都发表了一个声明书。他说，欧洲人往往指责美国“反对”欧洲人的殖民主义，而非洲人又往往指责美国支持它的盟国压制非洲人的自由，看起来美国对非洲的政策是矛盾的。“然而，我认为我们的态度是明确的，在我们的政策中并没有矛盾”。
    萨脱斯威特宣布，美国的政策是“支持要求独立的”“一切国家”，不过是有条件的。什么条件呢？第一，要这些国家“能够担负起独立的责任”；第二，要这些国家在争取独立的时候能够“有秩序和和平地演进”；第三还要这些国家“在自由世界中据有它应有的地位”。
    这个声明书妙就妙在这里，它本来就是一张画饼，用来骗人的，可是画来画去竟连饼也勾消了：支持“独立”的条件正好否定了“独立”的本身！首先，在殖民主义者看来，殖民地人民是“愚昧无知”，“没有政治经验”，“不会管理国家”的，因而也就是不能“担负起独立的责任的”，于是按照萨脱斯威特的第一个条件，一切非洲殖民地人民就不应该独立。其次，在殖民主义者看来，他们的殖民统治和制度，就是神圣不可侵犯的“秩序”，于是按照萨脱斯威特的第二个条件，一切非洲殖民地人民也就不应该独立。最后，即使它们摆脱了欧洲老牌殖民国家的殖民统治，那也不能得到独立，因为按照萨脱斯威特的第三个条件，这些国家还必须加入所谓“自由世界”，换句话说，就是要纳入美利坚殖民帝国之中。
    的确，美国对非洲的政策非常“明确”，并没有什么矛盾。它帮助欧洲殖民国家压制非洲民族独立运动，是为了扩张自己的势力；它打起反殖民主义的招牌“反对”欧洲殖民国家的殖民主义，也是为了扩张自己的势力。一句话，这就是美国的新殖民主义。
