Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 26th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the number of factories and enterprises that have completed or exceeded their production plans for the first half of this year is steadily increasing.

　　In the mining area of North Hamgyong Province, three coal mines had already exceeded their production plans for the first half of the year by June 22nd.

　　During this period, a worker at the Onsong Coal Mine produced 4.2 tons more coal per month than in the first half of last year. At the same time, they drilled 4,200 meters more in mine exploration than in the first half of last year.

　　The Hamyon Coal Mine, which completed its production plan targets for the first half of the year on June 22nd, increased its production of high-quality coal by 35% compared to the first half of last year.

　　According to materials compiled by the Ministry of Light Industry, as of last week, 25 factories under this ministry had completed their plans for the first half of the year. These factories include: the Pyongyang Silk Textile Factory, the Sinuiju Wool Textile Mill, the Pakcheon Silk Textile Mill, and the Hamhung Meat Processing Factory.

　　Due to the early completion of production plans by ten food factories, the output of processed foods is increasing significantly, and the variety has doubled compared to last year.

　　Several metal factories, including the Puryong Metallurgical Factory in North Hamgyong Province, as well as the Yalu River Transportation Company and other transportation companies, have also completed their production plans for the first half of the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 27th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, in the first five and a half months of this year, the output of machinery and equipment in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has doubled compared to the same period last year.

　　The output of machine tools increased by 2.4 times, and the output of other machines increased by 2.2 times.

　　Large-scale production of over one hundred types of machines has already begun in the first half of this year. Products include: tractors, excavators, bulldozers, trucks, tower cranes, internal combustion engines, various new metal cutting machines, mining equipment, thermal power turbines, hydroelectric generators, ultra-shortwave radios, telephone equipment, and various bearings.

　　Due to the enormous development of the machine manufacturing industry, it is possible to produce various devices domestically for several steel plants, equipment for metal mines and coal mines, and equipment for light industry, agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.

　　The main reasons for the improvement and growth in both the quality and quantity of machine production are the carrying out of the movement to increase the production of machine tools, the mass technical innovation movement, and the significant basic construction. These measures were taken under the slogan "Iron and machines are the king of industry."

    朝鲜大批工厂超额完成上半年计划
    头五个月机器和设备产量比去年同期增加一倍
    新华社平壤26日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社平壤25日讯，已经完成或超额完成今年上半年生产计划的工厂和企业正在不断增加。
    在咸镜北部的矿区，有三个煤矿已经在6月22日超额完成了上半年的生产计划。
    在这个时期，温城煤矿一个工人每月的产煤量比去年上半年多四点二吨，同时，在钻探矿井方面比去年上半年多钻了四千二百公尺。
    已经于6月22日完成了上半年生产计划指标的咸渊煤矿比去年上半年增产了35％的优质煤。
    据轻工业部编的材料，到上周为止，这个部所属的二十五个工厂已经完成了它们上半年的计划。这些工厂当中有：平壤丝织品工厂、新义州毛织厂、博川丝织厂以及咸兴肉类加工工厂。
    由于十个食品工厂提前完成了生产计划，经过加工的食品的产量正在显著地增加，品种也比去年增加了一倍。
    包括咸镜北道的富宁冶金工厂在内的若干金属工厂，以及鸭绿江运输公司和其他交通运输公司也已经完成了它们的上半年生产计划。
    新华社平壤27日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，在今年头五个半月中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的机器和设备的产量比去年同期增加了一倍。
    工作母机的产量增加到二点四倍，其它机器的产量增加到二点二倍。
    一百多种机器的大规模生产已经在今年上半年开始。产品包括：拖拉机、挖土机、推土机、卡车、塔形起重机、内燃引擎、各种新式金属切削机、采矿设备、热电涡轮机、水力发电机、超短波无线电、电话设备和各种轴承。
    由于机器制造业的巨大发展，就有可能在国内为几家钢铁厂生产各种装置，为金属矿山和煤矿生产设备，为轻工业、农业、渔业和林业生产设备。
    使机器生产在质量和数量方面都能有所提高和增长的主要原因，是由于开展了增产工作母机的运动、群众技术革新运动和进行了巨大的基本建设。这些措施是在“铁和机器是工业之王”的口号下采取的。
