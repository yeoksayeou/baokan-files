　　Raising Pigs on Mountains, Using Pig Manure to Fertilize Fields
　　Hog Production Increases and Grain Output Rises in Many Areas of Fujian
　　Fuzhou, June 23 (This newspaper dispatch) – To increase fine fertilizer for late-season crops, various regions of Fujian are vigorously engaging in a pig-raising and manure-collecting campaign.
　　Many communes, production teams, and farms throughout the province have established and expanded pig farms, increased the raising of sows, and encouraged members to raise pigs privately. The Houtang Brigade of the Shipo Commune in Pucheng County formulated measures to reward members for privately raising sows, and the number of pigs raised by the entire brigade rapidly increased from 315 in January to 573.
　　Some communes and production teams have built pig farms in the fields or mountain areas, opened up feed bases and built fertilizer pools and sheds nearby. The Lianwu Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Qingning County has more than 4,000 mu of farmland, more than 40% of which are mountain fields and remote fields far from the village, making fertilization and fertilizer transportation quite difficult. After the production brigade established five concentrated fertilizer bases in places such as Fanluodeng and Wangjiashan, and implemented raising pigs on mountains and using pig manure to fertilize fields, large tracts of mountain fields increased grain production by nearly 100% due to the increased application of concentrated fertilizer. The Heqian Farm in Ningde County, due to its vigorous efforts in raising pigs and collecting manure, has become a “four-good farm” with "hogs increasing year by year, fertilizer increasing year by year, grain production increasing year by year, and production costs decreasing year by year.” (Liu Kuihua)

    以山养猪　猪粪肥田
    福建许多地区生猪增长粮食增产
    本报福州23日电　福建各地为晚季作物增加精肥，正在大搞养猪积肥运动。
    全省很多公社、生产队和农场都已建立和扩大了养猪场，增养了大量母猪，并鼓励社员私人喂养。浦城县石坡公社后塘大队订出了奖励社员私人饲养母猪的办法，全大队养猪数量从1月份的三百十五头迅速发展到五百七十三头。
    有些公社和生产队把养猪场建在田头或山场，就近开辟饲料基地和修建肥池肥棚。清宁县城关公社连屋大队四千多亩田，40％以上都是离村较远的山田和远田，施肥、运肥相当困难。生产大队在饭罗登、王家山等地方建立了五个精肥基地，实行以山养猪，以猪肥田以后，大片山田由于增施精肥，稻谷增产近一倍。宁德县河乾农场，由于大搞养猪积肥，成为“毛猪年年增加，肥料年年增多，粮食年年增产，生产成本年年降低”的四好农场。（刘葵华）
