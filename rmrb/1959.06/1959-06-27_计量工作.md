    Metrology Work

    Every object has length, weight, and volume. Measuring the length and weight of objects, and determining the volume of objects, is called metrology.

    Metrology can be roughly divided into several types: length, temperature, mechanics, electricity, radio, radioactivity, acoustics, optics, and physical chemistry metrology. At present, the metrology work that is heavily used in handicraft production is mainly length, heat, force, and electricity.

    I. Length Metrology: Length metrology is an important means of improving labor productivity and ensuring quality. For example, the manufacture of machine tools in the machinery industry, power, metallurgy, mining machinery, automobiles, airplanes, ships, and agricultural machinery, whether large or precision products, all need to accurately meet the requirements of the drawings in terms of length. The accuracy of parts' dimensions, angles, threads, gears, surface finish, flatness, and various geometric angles and shapes must also meet design requirements.

    II. Temperature Metrology: Steelmaking, ironmaking, coking, and steel rolling in the metallurgical industry, casting, die-casting, heat treatment in the machinery industry, as well as acid production, alkali production, combustion reagents in the defense and chemical industries, as well as oil refining, cement, glass, and refractory materials, all require the measurement of different temperatures.

    III. Mechanics Metrology: Balances, cylinders, and measuring tubes used for chemical analysis, high pressure, high vacuum, high speed measurement, force, hardness, and density measurement for material testing, all require mechanics metrology.

    IV. Electrical Metrology: Measurement of current, voltage, ammeters, mutual inductors, galvanometers, bridges, etc.

    The basic task of metrology work is to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and correct use of measuring tools and instruments. That is to say, the measuring tools and instruments used in production and scientific research must be accurate, and must be consistent throughout the country.

    计量工作
    任何一种物体都有长度、重量、体积。测量物体的长度和重量，确定物体的体积，就叫作计量。
    计量大致可分为长度、温度、力学、电学、无线电、放射性、声学、光学、物理化学计量等几种。目前大量用手工业生产的计量工作，主要是长、热、力、电。
    一、长度计量：长度计量是提高劳动生产率、保证质量的重要手段。如机械工业中的工作母机，动力、冶金、矿山机械，汽车，飞机，船舶，农业机械的制造，无论是大型的还是精密的产品，都需要在长度方面正确地达到图纸的要求。零件的尺寸、角度、螺纹、齿轮，表面光洁度，平面性及各种几何角度、形状等的精度，也必须达到设计要求。
    二、温度计量：冶金工业的炼钢、炼铁、炼焦、轧钢和机械工业的铸造、铸压、冷热处理，以及国防和化学工业中的制酸、碱、燃烧试剂以及炼油，制水泥、玻璃、耐火材料等，都需要不同温度的计量。
    三、力学计量：化学分析用的天秤、量筒、量管，高压、高真空、高速度测量，材料试验的测力、硬度和密度等，都需要力学计量。
    四、电学计量：电流、电压、电流表、互感器、电流计、电桥等的计量。
    计量工作的基本任务是保证量具和计器的准确一致和正确地使用。也就是说，在生产中、科学研究中使用的量具计器必须准确，全国必须一致。
