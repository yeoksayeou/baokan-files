Old Works Shine, New Poetry Adds Splendor: Yunnan's Ethnic Minority Literary Scene Blossoms

(Our Dispatch) Kunming, Reporter Huang Changlu reports: The literary scene of ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province is blossoming. Outstanding literary works long buried among the people of various ethnic groups have been extensively unearthed and compiled.

A team of ethnic folk literature investigators organized by the Propaganda Department of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has, in the past six months, gone in batches to six autonomous prefectures including Xishuangbanna, Dehong, Honghe, Dali, Chuxiong, and Wenshan, and the Lijiang Special District. They investigated among the Dai, Yi, Hani, Bai, Naxi, Zhuang, Miao and other ethnic groups, collecting more than 400,000 pieces of ethnic folk literature and literary materials. Preliminary drafts of literary histories (literary overviews) of these seven ethnic groups and anthologies of folk songs, stories, and operas of each ethnic group have been compiled. Among these works, many are pearls that have been buried for a long time. There are five excellent long poems that have been preliminarily compiled. The Dai ethnic group's long narrative poem "Ebing and Sangluo" is the first branch in the garden. This long poem successfully uses the simple form of Dai folk poetry to express an anti-feudal love story. It describes the story of Sangluo, a Dai youth, who travels far away to escape a marriage arranged by his feudal family, and finally finds his beloved girl Ebing. This long poem makes extensive use of techniques such as metaphor, hyperbole, contrast, and foil, inheriting the characteristics of Dai literature that blends lyricism and narration, and uses personalized language to depict vivid images of a group of characters such as Sangluo and Ebing. It is full of the strong local flavor of the Dai people in the border areas, so it is unique and fascinating. The Yi ethnic epic "Meige," which is as long as eight thousand lines, is another type of representative work. This is a collective creation of the Yi people. It has been circulating orally among the Yi people on the south bank of the Jinsha River for a long time, and has been finalized through the supplementation and refinement of several generations. It uses simple and fluent language and musical melodies to explain the Yi people's primitive view of the universe, and sings the praises of labor creating the world.

Just as the inherent folk literature of ethnic minorities is shining brightly, singers, poets, and writers of various ethnic groups are adding to it with their new works. The Dai singer Kang Langying's recently created long poem "Song of the Liusha River" is another fragrant and beautiful flower in the ethnic minority art and literature garden. This 52-year-old Dai singer, Kang Langying, was once silent for fifteen years before liberation. During the Great Leap Forward, in Kang Langying's hometown - the rich and beautiful Xishuangbanna, the Dai people, under the leadership of the Party, realized their ancestors' wishes and built a reservoir on the Liusha River, a tributary of the Lancang River, turning the Menghai Dam, which had suffered from drought and floods for thousands of years, into fertile fields. The heroic deeds of the Dai people moved the old singer's heart. He personally participated in the construction of the reservoir, and after the completion of the reservoir, he wrote "Song of the Liusha River." The artistic form of this long poem is brand new, and it is developed on the basis of the Dai literary tradition. With rich ethnic flavor and vivid and appropriate metaphors, it skillfully blends ancient legends, distant history, and the fiery reality of life into a poem, achieving a combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.

    旧作品大放异彩　新诗歌锦上添花
    云南少数民族文坛百花争妍
    本报讯　记者黄昌禄报道：云南省少数民族文坛百花争妍。长期埋藏在各族人民中的优秀文学作品已被大量发掘和整理出来。
    由中共云南省委宣传部组织的一支民族民间文学调查队，半年来分批深入到西双版纳、德宏、红河、大理、楚雄、文山等六个自治州和丽江专区，在傣、彝、哈尼、白、纳西、僮、苗等民族中调查，共搜集到各民族民间文学作品和文学资料四十多万件，已编出了这七个民族的文学史（文学概况）和各民族的民歌、故事、戏曲等选集的初稿。在这些作品中，有不少是长期被埋没的明珠，现已初步整理出来的优秀长诗就有五部。傣族的长篇叙事诗“娥并与桑洛”是百花园中第一枝。这部长诗成功地运用了傣族民间诗歌的朴素形式，表现了反封建的爱情故事。它描写傣族青年桑洛为了反抗封建家庭包办的婚姻，远走他乡，终于找到了自己心爱的姑娘娥并的故事。这部长诗大量地采用了比喻、夸张、对比、陪衬等手法，继承了傣族文学抒情与叙事交融的特点，用个性化的语言刻划出了桑洛、娥并等一群人物的鲜明形象。它充满了边疆傣族人民的浓厚乡土气息，因此别具一格，引人入胜。长达八千行的彝族史诗“梅葛”是另一类型的代表，这是彝族人民的集体创作。它长期在金沙江南岸的彝人中口头流传着，经过若干世代的补充和提炼而定型。它用朴实而流畅的语言，富于音乐性的旋律解释了彝族人民原始的宇宙观，歌颂了劳动创造世界。
    正当少数民族固有的民间文学大放异彩的时候，各民族的歌手、诗人和作家又纷纷用他们的新著来锦上添花。傣族歌手康朗英最近创作的长诗“流沙河之歌”是少数民族文艺园中的一朵又香又美的花。这个五十二岁的傣族老歌手康朗英在解放前曾经沉默了十五年，大跃进中，在康朗英的家乡——富饶美丽的西双版纳，傣族人民在党的领导下实现了祖祖辈辈的愿望，在澜沧江支流流沙河上修起了一座水库，把千百年来受尽旱涝灾害的孟海坝变成了肥沃的良田。傣族人民的英雄业迹激动了老歌手的心，他亲自参加了修建水库的劳动，水库完成，便写出了“流沙河之歌”。这首长诗的艺术形式是崭新的，它是在傣族文学传统的基础上发展起来的。它以浓郁的民族情调，生动恰切的比喻，把古老的传说，遥远的历史和火热的现实生活巧妙地融汇在一个诗篇之中，做到革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合。（附图片）
