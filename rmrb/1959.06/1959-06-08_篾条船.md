    Bamboo Splint Boat
    The Guangyuan Transportation Company of Sichuan Province has successfully trial-produced a type of bamboo splint boat. The boat body is light with great buoyancy. An empty boat has a draft of only two *shi cun* [about 6.6 inches], and even when loaded with five tons of cargo, the draft is only one *shi chi* [about 13 inches]. It is easy and flexible to maneuver, and its navigation efficiency is 40% higher than that of wooden boats.
    This type of boat has a low cost (each costs only eighty yuan to build) and a very light hull, which can be carried by one person. It is suitable for rural areas to develop small river transportation.

    篾条船
    四川广元运输公司试制成功一种篾条船，船体轻，浮力大，空船吃水二市寸，装上五吨货物吃水也只一市尺，行驶轻便灵活，航效比木船高40％。
    这种船成本低廉（每只造价仅八十元），船身很轻，一人即可背动，适于农村发展小河运输。
