It has been a year since Mr. Yazi passed away. Last June, I received the news of his death in Hangzhou. It caused me great sorrow to lose such a close and dear friend. Since participating in the activities of the Tongmenghui in his early years, Mr. Yazi has always firmly stood on the side of the people's revolution. Throughout his life, he was steadfast and unyielding, with clear lines of love and hatred, and he never yielded to imperialism or the Kuomintang counter-revolutionaries. Zhongkai and I met him in 1920, and he was very supportive of Sun Yat-sen's three major policies of alliance with Soviet Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. After the Zhongshan Warship Incident in 1926, Chiang Kai-shek exposed his conspiracy to betray the revolution. Mr. Yazi left Guangzhou before the meeting was even over. Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries even wanted to arrest him. From then on, Mr. Yazi, along with progressive individuals, began to stand at the forefront of the revolutionary struggle, adhering to Sun Yat-sen's three major policies and opposing Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. For more than twenty years, he remained unyielding and never bowed to reactionary forces. During the "January 28th" Shanghai Battle, I, along with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, launched efforts to慰问(comfort) the soldiers fighting the Japanese and rescue the wounded. Later, we organized a rescue team to the Northeast to rescue the soldiers fighting the Japanese. To raise funds to relieve disaster victims and refugees, we organized charity sales of calligraphy and paintings. To oppose the unreasonable persecution and killing of revolutionary youth by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government, I wrote many letters and articles appealing to all sectors of society. Mr. Yazi actively supported and assisted in all of the above activities. (When Cheng Zhi and Li Shaoshi were arrested, Mr. Yazi spared no effort to help them.) In 1937, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people launched a full-scale War of Resistance against Japan, and Mr. Yazi actively supported it. After the Southern Anhui Incident in 1941, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government persecuted the New Fourth Army. We jointly issued a declaration in Hong Kong protesting against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries. When I raised this issue, Mr. Yazi immediately agreed, and he drafted the declaration. He not only signed the declaration but also actively campaigned for it. For this reason, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries even "expelled" Mr. Yazi from the "Kuomintang Party membership." After the War of Resistance against Japan, Mr. Yazi participated in the founding and initiation of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Hong Kong and served as its Secretary-General, actively responding to the call of the Chinese Communist Party on May 1, 1948, to convene a new Political Consultative Conference. After Mr. Yazi came to Beijing in 1949, he was elected as a member of the Central People's Government and a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. In the past few years, Mr. Yazi's health had not been very good, and he had been less active, but he resolutely supported the policies of the Communist Party until his last breath.

Mr. Yazi was a patriotic poet, intelligent and talented. Before the War of Resistance, I cooperated with several painters to raise funds through charity sales of Chinese paintings. Mr. Yazi often improvised poems on the spot, many of which expressed his firm revolutionary stance and satirized the reactionaries. Later, he created many poems praising the Chinese Communist Party and the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Many of his poems were linked to his political activities. His poems also clearly reflected his support for the people's revolution, his clear lines of love and hatred, and his adherence to Sun Yat-sen's three major policies.

I had a deep friendship with Mr. Yazi for more than thirty years, and we can truly be said to have shared the same ideals. Mr. Yazi inscribed two lines of poetry on a huge painting of pine and chrysanthemum I had painted: "Good essays and deep friendship go hand in hand, Only you and I share the same true nature." It has been a year since Mr. Yazi passed away, and I am extremely saddened by the loss of a good friend. But recalling Mr. Yazi's lifelong opposition to imperialism, opposition to the Kuomintang reactionaries, his lifelong commitment to upholding the three major policies, his firm support for the Chinese Communist Party, and his support for the Chinese people's great revolution, these have been achieved after the founding of the People's Republic of China. But, unfortunately, Mr. Yazi did not see the brilliant achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, nor did he see the new situation of the East Wind further prevailing over the West Wind. I recently wrote a poem entitled "The East Wind Prevails over the West Wind": "The East Wind is warm and stronger than the West Wind, Spring flowers are blooming everywhere, The bleak West Wind blows leaves down, Sad autumn, haggard and sighs at times of need." Mr. Yazi, if you have knowledge under the springs, you would certainly be comforted to see these encouraging situations.

    纪念柳亚子先生
    何兵凝
    亚子先生逝世已经一年了。去年6月，我是在杭州接到他去世的消息的。失去这样一位知交挚友，使我十分悲痛。亚子先生自早年参加同盟会的活动以来，一直坚定的站在人民革命的立场，他一生坚贞不屈，爱憎分明，对帝国主义和国民党反革命派从来没有屈服过。仲恺和我自1920年与他认识，他当时就很积极支持孙中山先生的联苏、联共、扶助农工三大政策。1926年中山舰事件发生之后，蒋介石暴露了他背叛革命的阴谋，当时会议尚未闭幕，亚子先生就离开广州了。蒋介石反动派还想通缉他。从此，亚子先生就和进步人士一起，开始走上坚持孙中山先生的三大政策、反对蒋介石反动统治的革命斗争前列，二十多年来，一直不屈不挠，没有向反动势力低头。“一二八”淞沪战役，我在上海和各界人民展开了慰劳抗日将士和救护伤兵的工作；其后还组织了一支救伤队到东北救护抗日将士，为了筹款赈济灾民难民，我们组织了书画义卖会，义卖筹款；为了反对蒋介石反动政府无理迫害残杀革命青年，我多方写信写文章向社会各界呼吁。以上的一系列活动，亚子先生都积极支持和协助。（承志和李少石被捕，亚子先生为他们奔走，不遗余力。）1937年中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，发动全面的抗日战争，亚子先生积极拥护抗日。1941年皖南事变发生，蒋介石反动政府迫害新四军，我们在香港联合发表宣言，对蒋介石反动派提出抗议。当我一提出这个问题的时候，亚子先生立即赞同，宣言就是由他起草的。他不但在宣言上签字，并且积极为这件事四出奔走。为此，蒋介石反动派竟“开除”了亚子先生的“国民党党籍”。抗日战争以后，亚子先生在香港参加了中国国民党革命委员会创始发起组织的工作，并担任秘书长的职务，积极响应1948年5月1日中国共产党所提出召开新政治协商会议的号召。1949年亚子先生来到北京之后，被选为中央人民政府委员和全国人大常委委员。几年以来，亚子先生身体不大健康，活动少了，但他坚决拥护共产党的方针政策，一直到他最后一息。
    亚子先生是一位爱国诗人，他聪颖，有奇才。抗战以前，我和三数画家合作国画义卖筹款，亚子先生常常即席挥毫题诗，其中有很多是表白坚定的革命立场和讽刺反动派的。其后，他又创作了很多歌颂中国共产党、歌颂中国人民革命胜利的诗篇。他的诗词很多都结合到他的政治活动。他的诗词也明显地反映了他拥护人民革命，爱憎分明，坚守孙中山先生三大政策的性格。
    我和亚子先生深交三十多年，真可以说是志同道合。亚子先生题在我画的松菊巨幅上，有两句诗：“文章有道交有神，唯我与君同性真。”亚子先生去世已经一年了，我痛失良友，真是万分悲伤。但是回念亚子先生一生反对帝国主义、反对国民党反动派，一生致力于维护三大政策，坚决拥护中国共产党，拥护中国人民大革命，这些，在中华人民共和国成立之后，已经达到了。但是，可惜的是，1958年大跃进的辉煌成绩，亚子先生是看不到了；东风进一步压倒西风的新形势，亚子先生也看不到了。我最近以“东风压倒西风”为题，写了一首诗：“东风和暖胜西风，春日名花处处红，萧瑟西风吹叶落，悲秋憔悴叹时穷。”亚子先生，你若然泉下有知，看到这些令人欢欣鼓舞的形势，一定也是很安慰的。
