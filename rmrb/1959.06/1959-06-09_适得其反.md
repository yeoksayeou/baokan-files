　　Backfired
　　After the Japanese House of Councillors election, the Nobusuke Kishi group bragged that his Liberal Democratic Party had "achieved victory." Wall Street's mouthpiece in New York also chimed in. However, the Wall Street bosses couldn't help but reveal the truth when they opened their mouths. "The New York Times" believes that Kishi Nobusuke's "victory" was the result of his "very cunning," "steady and cautious" hostility to the Japanese people's demands for independence and neutrality. "The New York Times" also said: "We never said that we ever 'forced' unwilling Japanese people to support Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke. But we do think that the influence of our ideas is good, and the Japanese have made good use of it." That is to say, Kishi Nobusuke's "victory" relied on implementing a policy of dependence on the United States, hostility towards China and the Asian people, and reviving militarism. The lackey has "merit," all thanks to the master's cultivation. Therefore, naturally, praising Kishi Nobusuke is also cheering for American imperialism itself.
　　Indeed, Kishi Nobusuke originally intended to seize two-thirds of the seats in the House of Councillors through this election in order to pave the way for revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and further tie Japan to the American war chariot. However, Kishi Nobusuke failed to obtain two-thirds of the seats in the House of Councillors. Therefore, although American imperialism and its servant Kishi Nobusuke wanted to "make good use of" the "influence of American ideas," the reality was not so ideal.
　　The reason why Kishi Nobusuke and "The New York Times" wanted to boast about their premature "victory" is simply because Kishi Nobusuke will never relax his implementation of reactionary policies following the United States. In this way, their boasting helps to inspire the Japanese people to continue their more determined struggle.

    适得其反
    日本参议院选举后，岸信介集团大吹大擂，说他的自由民主党“取得了胜利”。纽约的华尔街喉舌也帮起腔来。但是，华尔街的老板一开口就不免道出了真相。“纽约时报”认为，岸信介的“胜利”是他“非常机伶”、
  “稳健和谨慎地”敌视日本人民要求的独立和中立的结果。“纽约时报”还说：“我们从来没有说我们曾经‘强要’不情愿的日本人支持岸信介首相。但我们的确认为，我们的想法的影响是好的，而且日本人已经好好加以利用。”这就是说，岸信介的“胜利”是靠执行依附美国、敌视中国和亚洲人民、复活军国主义的政策。奴才有“功”，全仗主子一手栽培。因此，自然罗，替岸信介吹捧，也就是替美帝国主义自己叫好。
    的确，岸信介原是打算通过这次选举，攫取参议院的三分之二议席，以便为修改日美“安全条约”铺平道路，进一步把日本绑在美国战车上去的。但是，岸信介未能取得参院的三分之二的议席，因此，尽管美帝国主义和它的仆从岸信介很想“好好地利用”“美国想法的影响”，可是，事实却并不那么理想。
    岸信介和“纽约时报”所以要替他们过早的“胜利”吹嘘，只不过是因为岸信介决不放松他执行追随美国的反动政策。这样一来，他们的吹嘘，倒是有助于激发日本人民再接再厉地进行更坚决的斗争。
