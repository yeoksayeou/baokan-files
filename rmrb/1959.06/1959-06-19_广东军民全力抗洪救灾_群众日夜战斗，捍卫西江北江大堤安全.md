Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: The Party, government, military, and civilians of Guangdong Province have been urgently mobilized to fight floods, provide disaster relief, and simultaneously rush to harvest and replant.

Since the 11th, torrential rains in the Dongjiang River basin have reached 500 to 800 millimeters. In recent days, the weather has cleared, and the upstream water level has eased, with the flood receding. However, due to the excessive rainfall, the flood situation in the middle and lower reaches is extremely precarious. The Dongjiang River's water level near Huiyang City remains as high as 17.44 meters, exceeding the highest recorded level in 1947 by 1.35 meters. Cities and towns along the river, such as Heyuan, Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, and Dongguan, and the vast majority of villages remain submerged in floodwaters. Some cadres and masses are trapped by the floods on the mountaintops and embankments around Huiyang and Boluo.

The West River and North River embankments, which safeguard Guangdong Province's granary – the Pearl River Delta – and Guangzhou City, have remained safe and sound. However, the floodwater level is still above the warning level. According to a report from the Guangzhou Central Meteorological Observatory, heavy rains may occur again in the West River and North River areas of Guangxi and Guangdong in the coming days. Thus, the West River and North River still have the potential to overflow, and the safety of the Pearl River Delta and Guangzhou remains threatened.

The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, government, military, and people have taken emergency measures and are fighting the floods on all fronts. In the Dongjiang River basin, which has suffered the most severe disaster, every effort is being made to rescue the masses and materials trapped by the floods to minimize losses. In addition to the local leading organs and stationed troops deploying all available large and small wooden boats and vessels to rescue trapped cadres and masses, a large number of cadres, workers, and soldiers have been dispatched day and night, carrying emergency supplies and traveling on more than sixty motorboats to the disaster areas to rescue and慰问 (comfort) the masses. In the past two days, ten aircraft have been dispatched, flying in shifts from morning to night to airdrop cooked food, biscuits, clothing, and medicine to the besieged areas. To transport living and production materials to the disaster areas, the main highway from Guangzhou to Zengcheng was reopened to traffic today. As of the evening of the 17th, the vast majority of the flood-trapped victims and cadres have been rescued. The rescue of the trapped victims is still underway day and night.

The most important task for Guangdong Province in fighting the flood is to ensure the safety of the West River and North River embankments. All the Communist Party Committee Secretaries along the river are leading thousands upon thousands of people, fighting day and night on the West River and North River embankments. On the 17th, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, inspected the disaster area of the Dongjiang River by plane and personally went to the North River embankment to check the flood control work.

In the vast areas where no flood disaster or waterlogging has occurred, efforts are now being made to rush the harvest on one hand and vigorously drain water on the other. Early crops, especially early rice, in these areas have been submerged and mostly flattened, making them prone to sprouting; late rice seedlings have suffered heavy losses. With the strong support of the Central Government and the province, various localities are making full use of irrigation and drainage machinery to drain water day and night. In order to prevent rice from sprouting in rainy weather, effective measures have been taken in various places.

At the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee meeting held on the afternoon of the 17th by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, in addition to a comprehensive deployment of the current flood control, disaster relief, and harvest preservation work, the meeting also focused on studying the problem of late rice production and decided to take measures to vigorously solve the problem of the loss of late rice seedlings and seeds caused by this flood, striving to ensure that all 35 million mu of late rice can be sown in time.

### 广东军民全力抗洪救灾  群众日夜战斗，捍卫西江北江大堤安全

    广东军民全力抗洪救灾
    群众日夜战斗，捍卫西江北江大堤安全
    新华社广州18日电　广东省党政军民已紧急动员起来，全力抗洪、救灾，同时抢收、抢种。
    从11日以来，在东江流域暴雨倾泻达五百公厘至八百公厘，近日天晴，上游水势稍缓，洪水后退，但因下雨太大，中、下游汛情十分险恶。惠阳城附近的东江水位仍高达十七点四四公尺，超过有历史记载的1947年最高水位一点三五公尺。沿江的河源、惠阳、博罗、增城、东莞等县城，和绝大部分村庄仍浸在洪水中。部分干部、群众被洪水围困在惠阳、博罗一带的山顶上和堤围上。
    捍卫着广东省的粮仓——珠江三角洲和广州市安全的西江、北江大堤，一直安全无恙。但是洪水水位仍在警戒水位以上。据广州中心气象台报告，近日广西和广东的西江、北江又可能出现暴雨。这样，西江、北江仍有泛滥的可能，珠江三角洲和广州的安全仍然受到威胁。
    广东省党、政、军、民已经采取紧急措施，在各条战线上同洪水展开斗争。灾害较严重的东江流域，正在千方百计地抢救被洪水围困的群众和物资，力争减轻损失。除当地领导机关、驻军出动一切能够运行的大小木船、舰艇抢救被围困的干部、群众出险外，并星夜派出大批干部、工人、官兵，携带救急物资，分乘六十几条机动船只，前往灾区抢救和慰问群众。这两天还派出十架飞机，从早到晚，轮番飞往被围困地区空投熟食、饼干、衣物及药品。为了向灾区运去生活资料和生产资料，从广州到增城的公路干线已于今日抢修通车。到17日晚止，绝大部分被水围困的灾民和干部已经解救出来。抢救被围困灾民的工作还在星夜进行。
    广东省目前抗洪最重要的是保证西江、北江大堤的安全，沿江所有中共党委书记都带领着千千万万的人民群众日夜战斗在西、北江大堤上。17日中共广东省委第一书记陶铸乘飞机视察东江灾区，并亲赴北江大堤检查防洪工作。
    在未发生洪水灾害、渍水为患的广大地区，现在正一面抢收，一面大力进行排水。这些地区的早造作物，特别是早稻受浸后，大批倒伏，容易出芽；晚稻秧苗损失很大。在中央和省的有力支持下，各地正在充分利用排灌机械日夜排出渍水；为了防止稻谷雨天出芽，各地已采取了有效的措施。
    中共广东省委17日下午召开的省委常委会议上，对当前的防洪、救灾、保收工作进行了全面的部署外，还着重研究了晚造生产问题，并决定采取措施大力解决由于这次洪水侵害而造成的晚造秧苗的种子的损失问题，力争三千五百万亩晚稻能及时全部下种。
