Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th: Shanghai's oil pressing factories have started using new rapeseed transported from rural areas to extract oil. The first batch of over 200 tons of rapeseed cakes produced after oil extraction is immediately transported back to rural areas to supply the communes as fertilizer for autumn crops.

Farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai, who have achieved a bumper rapeseed harvest, have launched a high tide of selling rapeseed in recent days, with an average daily intake of about seven million jin of rapeseed. Since the rapeseed harvest began, the state has purchased more than 40 million jin.

In front of the purchasing stations in the eleven counties under the jurisdiction of Shanghai, these days from early morning to night, one can only see vehicles and boats loaded with rapeseed coming and going in an endless stream. The rapeseed sold by the communes this year is generally dry, clean, and of good quality. The Jinjiaqiao purchasing station in Pudong County has issued more than 200 "Certificates of Honor" to communes and production teams to commend them.

The purchasing stations ensure that the rapeseed is collected and transported promptly to the factories for oil extraction. After the purchase is completed every night, the purchasing staff are still packing and loading the rapeseed at two or three o'clock in the morning. Some communes also send vehicles and boats to help the purchasing stations with crash transportation. Currently, the amount of rapeseed transferred from various counties to the oil pressing factories in the urban area is more than 15 million jin. The rapeseed cakes produced by the oil pressing factories are also immediately transported to rural areas to support agricultural production.

    上海开始用新菜籽榨油
    第一批菜籽饼运回农村支援生产
    新华社上海19日电　上海的榨油厂开始用从农村运来的新菜籽榨油；榨油后的第一批二百多吨菜籽饼，又马上运往农村，供给公社作为秋季作物的肥料。
    油菜大丰收的上海市郊农民，连日来掀起出售菜籽的高潮，平均每天入库的菜籽有七百万斤左右。自菜籽登场以来，国家已经收购四千万斤以上。
    上海市所属十一个县的收购站门前，这些日子从清早到夜晚，只见满载菜籽的车船络绎不绝。各公社今年出售的菜籽普遍干燥洁净，质量好。浦东县的金家桥收购站就已发出二百多张“光荣证”给公社和生产队，表扬他们。
    各收购站做到随收随送，及时地把油菜籽送到工厂榨油。每晚收购结束后，收购人员在深夜二、三点钟，还在进行油菜籽包扎和装车工作。有些公社也抽调车船帮助收购站突击运输。现在各县调运到市区各榨油厂的菜籽已有一千五百多万斤。各榨油厂榨出菜籽饼，也立即运去农村，支援农业生产。
