    Five years have passed. The cooks at East China Normal University have maintained good hygiene habits.
    The cultivation of these hygiene habits has been the result of a struggle. As early as 1953 and 1954, the school's cafeteria experienced two food poisoning incidents. As a result, some of the cafeteria staff became hesitant and overcautious. Considering that fish tends to spoil easily in hot weather, they simply stopped buying fish to eat in the summer of 1955. Later, students raised many opinions, and the leading comrades in the general affairs office helped them correct their self-defeating thinking, which enabled the staff in the cafeteria to become active again. For example, the purchaser guaranteed not to buy spoiled food, and the cooks, based on diligent sweeping and washing, and boiling and disinfecting utensils, formulated a more complete hygiene system. They were very serious about implementing the system. They worked in five shifts every day, and the shifts often challenged each other and inspected each other.
    In this way, from 1955 to the present, they have maintained the frequent cleanliness of the kitchen inside and out, the environment, utensils, and the cooks themselves, separating raw and cooked food, and not making raw and cold dishes, day after day for five years. Furthermore, they use drugs to test the food before each meal. In order to ensure that the students eat well, they also find ways to bake bread and make pastries to increase the variety of food.

    五年如一日
    已经五年了。华东师范大学的炊事员，一直保持着良好的卫生习惯。
    这种卫生习惯的养成，是经过一番斗争的。早在1953年和1954年的时候，这个学校的食堂曾连续发生过两次食物中毒的事件。因此，有些食堂工作人员就变得缩手缩脚起来。他们考虑到热天的鱼容易腐烂，1955年夏天就干脆不买鱼吃。后来学生提了好多意见，总务处的领导同志，也帮助他们纠正了因噎废食的思想，才使得食堂里的工作人员积极起来。如采购员保证不买腐坏食品，炊事员在勤扫勤洗、食具煮沸消毒的基础上，订出了更完整的卫生制度等等。他们执行制度十分认真。每天分五个班工作，班与班之间经常挑战，互相检查。
    就是这样，他们从1955年到现在，五年如一日地做到厨房内外、环境、用具以及炊事员个人的经常清洁，生熟食分开处理，不做生冷凉拌菜。并且，在每次开饭前，还用药物检验食品。为了使学生们吃得好，他们还想办法烤面包、做糕点，增加食物的花色品种。
