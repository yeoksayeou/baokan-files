Shanghai Units Raise 18,000 Pigs and 440,000 Poultry

According to the *Liberation Daily*, since the second half of last year, many government offices in Shanghai, in conjunction with the labor training of cadres sent to lower levels, have established their own farms in the suburbs and vigorously developed non-staple food production. To date, municipal and district-level government offices have established more than 40 farms, with over 25,000 mu of cultivated land and over 8,000 mu of aquaculture area. As of the end of May, the 40-plus farms raised a total of more than 18,000 pigs, more than 440,000 poultry, and approximately 20 million freshwater fish.

In just a few months, these 40-plus farms have generally developed rapidly. For example, Changxing Island, located outside Wusongkou, has lush aquatic plants and abundant natural feed, making it an excellent place for raising ducks. However, in the past, there was a lot of wasteland that was not well developed. Last year, cadres from the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Second Bureau of Commerce established the Jin Daisha and San Gao Farms here one after another; Shanghai Milk Company opened the Eighth Ranch here. The cadres overcame many difficulties and started from scratch. In a short period of time, the three units have raised more than 50,000 ducks and thousands of pigs.

In order to get the farms into production as soon as possible, many units have adopted the method of building and producing simultaneously. For example, the farm newly built in Qingpu by cadres from the Luwan District government has only been under construction for more than a month, but it has already raised more than 300 pigs and more than 6,000 poultry. Some units that were established earlier have gained some good experience through the hard work of their cadres. For example, the Ti Mian Friendship Farm, run by the Ti Lan District government in Nanhui County, has explored some experience in pig feeding management and duck grazing. The pig mortality rate is extremely low, and the duck egg production rate can reach about 85%.

Shenyang Establishes 97 Self-Sufficiency Small-Scale Vegetable and Livestock Farms

(Our Newspaper, Shenyang, June 19th) Factories, mines, government offices, schools, and military units in Shenyang are running self-sufficiency small-scale farms in conjunction with labor training. According to preliminary statistics, the city has established 97 self-sufficiency small-scale vegetable and livestock farms, with a land area of more than 34,000 mu.

Thanks to the active efforts of all units, small-scale farms are developing rapidly. At present, these farms have raised 4,745 pigs, 718 dairy cows and dairy goats, more than 22,600 chickens, and nearly 2,000 rabbits. About one-third of the non-staple food needed by Liaoning University is supplied by its own farm. The 700 mu of land at Shenyang Agricultural College has been planted with a variety of vegetables, which can supply the market with a portion in addition to self-sufficiency.

All units attach great importance to running small-scale farms, transferring full-time cadres to be responsible for the work of the farms, and assigning a group of personnel to participate in farm labor and other work year-round. Many units organize employees and cadres to participate in labor in rotation, using the farm as a base for labor training. In order to provide sufficient water sources for the vegetable fields, 24 units have drilled 12 electric wells, 8 animal-powered wells, and some small shallow wells on their own farms. Relevant municipal and district departments and suburban people's communes provide these farms with seeds, breeding livestock, breeding poultry, and small farm tools, and provide guidance on feeding and vegetable cultivation techniques, which has played a significant role in the rapid normalization of production on self-run farms.

Sichuan Provincial and Chengdu Municipal Government Offices Universally Raise Pigs and Grow Vegetables

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 18th. Sichuan Provincial and Chengdu Municipal government offices are carrying out pig-raising and vegetable-growing activities, and have currently raised more than 11,000 pigs and planted many vegetables and feed crops.

These government offices' pig-raising and vegetable-growing activities began as early as last year. So far, the units under the Provincial People's Committee have raised more than 1,500 pigs and planted more than 200 mu of vegetables and feed crops. Cadres of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee not only raised more than 100 pigs, but also raised more than 300 poultry and livestock such as chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits. In the case of very little open space in the city, these government offices have made full use of courtyards and spaces beside houses to grow vegetables, and some have also reclaimed wasteland in the suburbs. The pig feed mainly relies on self-cultivation of feed crops such as thick-skinned vegetables. Under the specific leadership of the Party organization and the personal participation of responsible cadres, the cadres of all units enthusiastically participated in the labor of raising pigs and growing vegetables. All units have adopted the method of rotating one month of labor per person, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on cadres participating in physical labor, while also utilizing some spare time. In this way, it not only does not affect the work of the organs, but also ensures the smooth progress of production activities.

The pig-raising and vegetable-growing activities of the government offices not only provide every cadre with the opportunity for labor training, but also improve the food in the canteens of the government offices. In addition to their own consumption, the pigs raised by the units are also sold to the state. (Attached picture)

    机关办农场　增产副食品
    上海各单位养猪一万八千头家禽四十四万只
    据解放日报消息　去年下半年以来，上海市很多机关结合下放干部劳动锻炼，在市郊自办农场，大搞副食品生产。到目前为止，市、区两级机关已经先后举办了四十多个农场，拥有耕地面积两万五千多亩、放养水面八千多亩；截至5月底，四十多个农场共养猪一万八千多头，家禽四十四万多只，淡水鱼约二千万尾。
    在短短的几个月中，这四十多个农场，一般都发展很快。如位于吴淞口外的长兴岛，水草茂盛，天然饲料丰富，是养鸭的良好场所。但是过去荒地多，没有很好地开发。去年，上海市人民委员会机关、上海市商业二局的下放干部，先后在这里建立了金带沙、三高农场；上海市牛奶公司在这里开辟了第八牧场。干部们克服了许多困难，平地起家，在短时期内，三个单位已养了五万多只鸭和数千头猪。
    为了使农场早日开始生产，很多单位采取边建场、边生产的方法。如卢湾区机关下放干部在青浦新建的农场，虽然建场为时仅有一个多月，现在已养猪三百多头，家禽六千多只。有些建场较早的单位，在干部们刻苦钻研下，已经取得了一些好的经验，如提篮区机关在南汇县办的提沔友谊农场，对猪的饲养管理、鸭的放牧方面，都摸索到一些经验，猪的死亡率极少，鸭的产蛋率可达85％左右。
    沈阳办起自给性小型蔬菜畜牧农场九十七处
    本报沈阳19日电　沈阳市厂矿、机关、学校、部队结合劳动锻炼，举办自给性小型农场。据初步统计，全市已办起自给性小型蔬菜畜牧农场九十七处，土地面积达三万四千多亩。
    由于各单位积极努力，小型农场发展很快。目前，这些农场已饲养生猪四千七百四十五头，奶牛、奶羊七百一十八头，鸡二万二千六百多只，兔近两千只。辽宁大学所需要的副食品，已有三分之一左右由自办农场供给。沈阳农学院七百亩地，种上了多种蔬菜，除了自给以外，还能供应市场一部分。
    各单位对举办小型农场，都很重视，抽调专职干部负责农场的工作，配备一批人员常年参加农场劳动等工作。不少单位组织职工、干部轮流参加劳动，以农场作为劳动锻炼的基地。为了使菜田有充足的水源，有二十四个单位在自办的农场里打了电井十二眼、畜力井八眼和一些小洋井。市、区有关部门和郊区人民公社，供给这些农场以种籽、种畜、种禽和小农具，在饲养和种菜技术上给予指导，这对自办农场的生产迅速走向正常起了很大的作用。
    四川省级机关和成都市级机关普遍养猪种菜
    新华社成都18日电　四川省级机关和成都市级机关开展养猪种菜活动，目前已饲养了一万一千多头猪，种植了许多蔬菜和饲料作物。
    这些机关的养猪种菜活动，早在去年就开始了。到现在，省人民委员会所属各单位共已养猪一千五百多头，种植蔬菜和饲料作物二百多亩。中共四川省委机关干部不仅养了一百多头猪，还养了鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等家禽家畜三百多只。在城市空地很少的情况下，这些机关大都充分利用庭院和屋旁隙地种菜，有的也到郊区垦殖荒地。猪的饲料，主要靠自己种植厚皮菜等饲料作物来解决。在党组织的具体领导和负责干部的亲自参与下，各单位干部都踊跃参加了养猪种菜的劳动。各单位按照中共中央和国务院关于干部参加体力劳动的规定，采取了每人轮流劳动一个月的办法，同时也利用一些业余时间。这样，既不影响机关工作，又保证了生产活动的顺利进行。
    机关的养猪种菜活动，不仅使每个干部都有劳动锻炼的机会，而且也使机关伙食有所改善。各单位养的猪除了自己食用以外，还卖给国家。（附图片）
