Grass Pulp Paper Making Has Great Potential
    Wei Ming
    Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Light Industry

    The Shanghai paper industry relies mostly on external supply for its paper pulp. Since the second half of last year, in order to solve the problem of raw material supply and increase the production of more paper, Shanghai has launched a mass movement to vigorously develop the production of local grass pulp. At present, forty-eight local grass pulp bases have been established in one hundred and three people's communes in the eleven suburban counties of Shanghai. In Jinshan County, ten of the eleven people's communes are already producing local grass pulp. In the first quarter, a total of 3,472 tons of local grass pulp was produced, and 2,000 tons were produced in April alone.

    There were some disputes at the beginning of the production of local grass pulp. First, the pulp-paper debate: should pulp be produced first and then paper, or should pulp and paper be developed simultaneously? Second, the indigenous-foreign debate: what method should be used for production? Should it be normal pressure cooking or pickling fermentation? Third, the price debate: is the provisional price reasonable? What if we lose money? Fourth, the use of local pulp debate: what kind of paper should be made from local grass pulp? Will it reduce vehicle speed? What about the impact on production? After debate and visits to factories, these issues were basically resolved, and everyone unanimously realized that pulp should be produced first to accumulate funds, and then developed into paper mills. Factories with the conditions should develop pulp and paper simultaneously, while factories without the conditions should produce pulp first and then paper. This approach requires less investment, is faster, and has a greater impact. Some people believe that grass pulp production is backward, with small quantities, poor quality, high prices, a lot of mud and sand, and slow dehydration, which affects vehicle speed. They are unwilling to produce it and prefer to use normal pressure cooking. The quality of grass pulp produced by normal pressure cooking is better than that of lime grass pulp, but it is not completely stable, especially since the supply of earthen pots used is limited, a certain amount of chemical raw materials are needed, and the cost is high and the quality is low. In order to find a more realistic, more economical, and immediately effective method, pickling fermentation with lime is still the main method. Factories with the conditions can use both normal pressure cooking and pickling fermentation methods at the same time. The price of grass pulp is related to the accumulation and distribution of funds in the communes, and also involves the relationship between ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. After research, the price of grass pulp has also been appropriately adjusted.

    Shanghai has very rich raw material resources. According to the investigations and understanding of the eleven counties in the suburbs of Shanghai by various factories, it is estimated that 1.27 million tons of rice straw, 200,000 tons of wheat straw, 290,000 tons of cotton stalks, 70,000 tons of reeds, and 60,000 tons of various wild weeds can be produced annually. In addition to the needs for fuel, feed, housing construction, and industrial needs such as making straw ropes and straw bags, about 360,000 tons can be used for papermaking, accounting for only 19% of the total resources. Calculating based on an annual production of 50,000 tons of local grass pulp, only 80,000 tons of rice straw are needed, which will not affect the supply of rice straw in other aspects.

    The fact that local grass pulp has a lot of mud and sand, poor quality, and the vehicle speed cannot be increased is indeed a difficult problem. Therefore, the technical barrier of local grass pulp is an urgent problem to be solved in production. However, the masses have a lot of wisdom, and as long as the masses get up and use their brains, any difficulty can be overcome. After two months, this problem was solved. Baoshan Paper Mill uses 55% local grass pulp to produce natural letterpress paper on a Fourdrinier paper machine, with a vehicle speed of 115 meters per minute. Lihua Paper Mill uses 100% local grass pulp to produce natural letterpress paper, with a vehicle speed of 100 meters per minute. These two events encouraged the workers of all paper mills in Shanghai, and everyone has more confidence in using local grass pulp.

    In short, as long as the raw materials are cleaned, and the paper machine is slightly improved, local grass pulp can be fully used, and the vehicle speed can also be increased. Now, local grass pulp has basically passed the technical barrier, and people no longer say it is "coarse grain." Local grass pulp can not only be used to produce packaging paper, but also various natural letterpress papers, which has a wide range of applications.

    草浆造纸大有可为
    上海市轻工业局副局长　韦明
    上海造纸工业用的纸浆，大部分依靠外地供应。从去年下半年起，为了解决原料供应问题，增产更多的纸张，上海掀起了大搞土草浆生产的群众运动。目前，上海郊区十一个县、一百零三个人民公社，已经建立起四十八个土草浆据点。金山县十一个人民公社，已有十个公社生产土草浆。第一季度共生产土草浆三千四百七十二吨，4月份一个月就生产了二千吨。
    开始生产土草浆，是有过一些争论的。一、浆纸之争：是先生产浆后生产纸呢？还是浆纸并举？二、土洋之争：用什么方法生产？是常压蒸煮，还是腌制发酵？三、价格之争：暂作价格是不是合理？万一亏了本怎么办？四、土浆使用之争：土草浆造什么纸？会不会降低车速？影响产量怎么办？经过争论和到工厂参观，这些问题基本上都得到了解决，大家一致认识到，应该先生产浆，以积累资金，然后再发展成纸厂。有条件的厂浆纸并举，没有条件的厂先浆后纸。这种做法投资少、时间快、效果大。有些人认为草浆生产落后，量少、质差、价格高、泥沙多、脱水慢，影响车速，不愿意生产，要生产就以常压蒸煮为主。常压蒸煮草浆，质量是比石灰草浆好些，但是也不完全稳定，特别是使用的土锅供应有限，又需要一定数量的化工原料，并且成本高，质量低。为了寻求更现实、更经济、立即见效的办法，还是以石灰腌制发酵为主。有条件的厂，可以同时采用常压蒸煮和腌制发酵两种方法。草浆的价格，关系到公社资金的积累和分配，也牵连到全民所有制和集体所有制的关系问题。经过研究，草浆的价格也作了适当的调整。
    上海的原料资源非常丰富。根据各厂调查了解上海郊区十一个县的情况，预计每年可以生产稻草一百二十七万吨，麦秆二十万吨，棉秆二十九万吨，芦苇七万吨，各种野生杂草六万吨。除掉作燃料、饲料、盖房，做草绳、草包等工业需要以外，可用于造纸的还有三十六万吨左右，仅占资源总数的19％。以年产土草浆五万吨计算，只需稻草八万吨，不致影响稻草的其他方面的供应。
    土草浆泥沙多，质量差，车速提不高，确实是一个难关。因此，土草浆过技术关是生产上急待解决的问题。但是，群众智慧多，只要群众起来动脑筋，任何困难都是可以克服的。经过两个月的时间，这个问题解决了。宝山造纸厂圆网机用55％的土草浆生产本色凸版纸，车速每分钟一百一十五公尺。利华造纸厂用百分之百的土草浆生产本色凸版纸，车速每分钟一百公尺。这两件事鼓舞了全上海造纸厂的职工，大家对使用土草浆的信心更高了。
    总之，只要料汰得干净，纸车上稍加改进，土草浆是完全可以使用的，车速也可以提高。现在，土草浆基本上过了技术关，人们不再说它是“粗粮”了。用土草浆不但可以生产包装纸，而且还可以生产各种本色凸版纸，应用范围很广。
