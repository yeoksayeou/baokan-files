Mountain Canal

The Tao River originates from the eastern foot of the West Qinling Mountains in the Die Mountains on the southwestern border of Gansu Province. It flows through Zhuoni County and Min County in southern Gansu, turns westward, circles a large arc, and then rushes northward, passing through Huichuan County and Lintao County before entering the Yellow River at Maolian Gorge, with a total length of 580 kilometers. The great "Divert Tao River" project involves building a dam on the Tao River in Gucheng, Min County, causing the river to turn eastward, following the towering mountains, passing through Huajialing in Tongwei County, to the Dongzhi Tableland in Qingyang County at an altitude of 1,400 meters. Because it runs on mountains with an average altitude of 1,700 meters, it is called the "Mountain Canal."

The "Divert Tao River" project was decided at the Second Session of the Second Gansu Provincial Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in February 1958. The total length of the main canal of this project is 1,400 kilometers, with a water surface width of 40 meters, a bottom width of 16 meters, a water depth of 6 meters, and a flow rate of 150 cubic meters per second. The entire project requires crossing more than 800 large and small river valleys and ravines, bypassing and splitting more than 200 towering mountains, excavating approximately 1.8 billion cubic meters of earth and stone, constructing hundreds of water gates, bridges, and energy dissipation structures, and building two large reservoirs: the Gucheng Reservoir with a dam height of 40 meters and the Yegu Reservoir with a dam height of 70 meters. The effective capacity of both is 500 million cubic meters. The scale of this "Mountain Canal" project, the difficulty of the task, and the complexity of the technology are unprecedented. The length of the "Mountain Canal" alone is equal to 8.4 times the world-famous Suez Canal and 18.5 times the Panama Canal. The construction of these two so-called modern canals took ten years, while our "Mountain Canal," which is being constructed with mechanized earthwork, can be completed in just two years.

The entire "Divert Tao River Uphill" water conservancy project is being carried out in two phases. The first phase of the project extends from Gucheng in Min County to Dayingliang in Longxi County, with a total length of 600 kilometers, and more than 42.5% has been completed. The second phase of the project extends from Dayingliang to Dongzhi Tableland in Qingyang County, with a length of approximately 800 kilometers, and is currently undergoing surveying and design. By 1960, this great project, comparable to the ancient Great Wall and the Grand Canal of our motherland, will be completed victoriously! At that time, the "Mountain Canal" will be navigable for ships of 20 to 100 tons, the mountainous areas it flows through will be fully irrigated, turning 1.5 to 2 million mu of dry land into paddy fields, increasing grain production by three to four times, increasing rapeseed production by one to two times, producing 50 million to 70 million jin of ginned cotton annually, and after tens of millions of mu of forests mature, producing 3.3 billion cubic meters of timber annually, promoting soil and water conservation over 50,000 square kilometers, and leading to herds of cattle and sheep. The more than 100 small and medium-sized hydroelectric power stations built in the mountainous areas will generate 500,000 kilowatts of electricity, which can be used as power for various undertakings.

    山上运河
    洮河，发源于甘肃省西南边界于迭山脉的西倾山东麓，流经甘肃南部的卓尼县和岷县，折转向西，绕过一个大圈后奔腾而北，经会川县、临洮县至毛帘峡入黄河，全长五百八十公里。伟大的引洮工程，要从岷县古城，在洮河里修筑大坝，使这条河扭头向东，沿着崇山峻岭，经过通渭县的华家岭，到海拔一千四百公尺的庆阳县董志塬。因为它走行在平均海拔一千七百公尺的山上，所以称为“山上运河”。
    引洮工程是在1958年2月中共甘肃省第二届代表大会第二次会议上的决定。这个工程的总干渠全长一千四百公里，水面宽四十公尺，底宽十六公尺，水深六公尺，流量一百五十秒公方。整个工程需要跨过大小河谷，沟涧八百余处，绕过和劈开崇山峻岭二百余座，需挖土石方约十八亿公方，建筑水闸、桥梁和消能建筑物数百座，兴修大型蓄水库两座：古城水库坝高四十公尺，野孤水库坝高七十公尺。两者有效容量为五亿公方。这条“山上运河”工程之浩大，任务之艰巨和技术之复杂是空前的。仅“山上运河”的长度就等于世界著名的苏伊士运河的八点四倍，等于巴拿马运河的十八点五倍。造成这两条所谓现代化工程的运河，整整花了十年的时间，而我们用土机械化进行施工的“山上运河”，却只要两年的时间就可以完成。
    引洮上山的整个水利工程分两期进行。第一期工程由岷县的古城到陇西县的大营梁，全长六百公里，目前已完成42.5％以上。第二期工程由大营梁到庆阳县的董志塬，长约八百公里，现在正进行勘测、设计。到1960年，这个可与祖国古长城和古运河媲美的伟大工程，就可以全部胜利地完成了！那时候，“山上运河”将通航二十吨到一百吨的船只，它流经的山区将饱饮甘泉，使一千五百至二千万亩的旱地变成水田，粮食将增产三、四倍，油菜籽将增产一、二倍，年产皮棉五千万至七千万斤，数千万亩森林成林后年产木材三十三亿立方公尺，促进水土保持五万平方公里，牛羊成群。山区建立起来的一百多个中小型水力发电站，发出的五十万瓩电力，可作兴办各种事业的动力。（附图片）
