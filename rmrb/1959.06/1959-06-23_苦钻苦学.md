　　Diligent Study and Hard Work

Comrade Cai Shijie has performed well in his work, labor, and studies, and has been commended by his superiors and supported by the masses. He created and used the methods of "diligence," "squeezing," and "utilizing" to resolve the contradiction between study and production, diligently studying and reading, learning revolutionary theory and knowledge of production struggles, and improving his work ability. He is a model for grassroots cadres.

At present, some grassroots cadres work very well and labor very well, but they do not study very seriously. Although they have made many achievements and won the support of the masses, due to their low political and cultural level, lack of knowledge, and narrow vision, their work ability is limited and cannot be further improved. Some have even formed some conservative ideas, resulting in losses in their work. We hope that the majority of grassroots cadres can learn from Comrade Cai Shijie's spirit of learning, improve their abilities, and do their work better.

    苦钻苦学
    蔡士杰同志工作好、劳动好、学习好，得到了上级的表扬，群众的拥护。他创造和运用了“苦”“挤”“用”的方法，解决了学习和生产的矛盾，苦钻苦学，认真读书，学到了革命理论和生产斗争的知识，提高了工作能力。这是基层干部的榜样。
    现在，有些基层干部，工作很好，劳动也很好，就是不大认真学习。他们虽则作出了不少成绩，也取得了群众的拥护，但是，由于政治文化水平不高，知识不多，眼界不广，在工作能力上受到了限制，不能进一步提高。有的就形成了某些保守思想，以致工作受到损失。我们希望广大基层干部，都能学习蔡士杰同志的学习精神，提高能力，把工作作得更好。
