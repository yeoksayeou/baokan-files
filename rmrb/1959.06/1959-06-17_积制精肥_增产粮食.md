Shanxi Adopts High-Temperature Rapid Composting Method
Shandong Utilizes Waste to Produce Large Quantities of Indigenous Chemical Fertilizer

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 16th dispatch) People's communes throughout Shanxi Province are seizing the excellent opportunity of abundant fertilizer sources and rapid decomposition to launch a summer fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, striving to solve the fertilizer needs for replanted crops and major autumn crops.

This year, the planting area of summer and autumn crops in the Jinbei area has expanded by 500,000 mu compared to last year. In order to ensure frequent fertilization and abundant fertilization, and to achieve more planting and more harvesting, all areas in the special district are vigorously carrying out high-temperature rapid composting, large-scale production of indigenous chemical fertilizers, and bacterial fertilizers. In Ningwu, Hequ, Yanggao, Shuoxian, Xinding, and other counties alone, the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers in half a month is equivalent to the production volume of the past four months. The entire district has universally applied topdressing fertilizer to 3.4 million mu of autumn crops in conjunction with weeding. In recent months, the Jin southeast area has used high-temperature composting methods to produce fertilizer and has collected nearly 10 billion jin of farm manure, stable manure, and miscellaneous manure. Autumn seedlings on 150,000 mu with insufficient base fertilizer or affected by wind and hail have received additional topdressing. Many people's communes in various places have also actively established composting pits in the fields, built toilets and livestock pens, and carried out year-round fertilizer accumulation, adapting to local conditions.

In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, people's communes in various places have properly arranged labor and time, established a responsibility system for fertilizer accumulation and production, implemented cadre responsibility for designated areas, and commune member contracts for designated plots, ensuring the completion of tasks on time, with quality, and in quantity. At the same time, methods such as payment according to labor were implemented, greatly promoting the development of the fertilizer accumulation campaign. While accumulating fertilizer, commune members in the Jinzhong area also implemented the method of carrying fertilizer to the fields while working in the fields, and have already delivered more than 10 million dan of fertilizer for replanted crops to the fields in advance.

(Our newspaper, Jinan, 16th dispatch) A high tide of summer fertilizer accumulation and production has initially formed in Shandong Province. Now the labor force participating in fertilizer accumulation and production in the province has increased to more than 2.7 million people, and more than 70 billion jin of topdressing fertilizer has been accumulated and produced within more than a month after the completion of spring sowing and fertilization.

This year, Shandong Province's 120 million mu of spring and summer crops need an additional 2,000 jin of standard compost fertilizer per mu. In order to accumulate and produce several hundred billion jin of compost fertilizer and a large amount of indigenous chemical fertilizer in the short period between summer and autumn, Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province have strengthened the leadership of fertilizer accumulation work and launched a mass fertilizer accumulation, production, seeding fertilizer, and fertilizer preservation campaign. Fertilizer accumulation professional teams in Liaocheng and Linyi special districts adopted methods such as vigorously developing indigenous miscellaneous fertilizer and various chemical fertilizers, raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and accumulating human manure and urine. In half a month, they accumulated 25.8 billion jin of indigenous miscellaneous fertilizer and manufactured a large amount of bacterial fertilizer and indigenous chemical fertilizer. People's communes in Qihe, Gaotang, Fanxian, Liaocheng, and other counties and cities also seized the gaps before wheat harvest and launched a concentrated week of everyone working and every household accumulating fertilizer.

In the large-scale fertilizer accumulation and production, Party committees in various places attach great importance to the production of indigenous chemical fertilizer. At present, the province's indigenous chemical fertilizer plants can produce a total of 500 million to 1 billion jin of high-quality indigenous chemical fertilizer per month. In the manufacture of indigenous chemical fertilizers, fertilizer plants in various counties also adopted methods adapted to local conditions, such as mining in the mountains, extracting brine along the coast, extracting nitrates from the plains, extracting nitrogen from smoke, and utilizing waste, taking materials locally, manufacturing locally, and utilizing locally, greatly increasing the output of indigenous chemical fertilizer.

In order to help people's communes improve fertilizer quality and improve fertilizer accumulation, preservation, and fertilization methods, Party committees at all levels actively organize agricultural and commercial departments, agricultural technology cadres from agricultural scientific research institutions and universities at the provincial, special, and county levels, and go deep into the people's communes to summarize and promote experience in improving fertilizer efficiency together with the masses. People's communes in Yantai, Liaocheng, and Linyi special districts have also promoted sealing manure piles and changing the method of drying human manure to the method of watering with diluted manure to prevent fertilizer from volatilizing and being lost. In the method of applying topdressing fertilizer, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are appropriately matched, organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer are appropriately matched, and fast-acting fertilizer and slow-acting fertilizer are appropriately matched. Different types of fertilizer are applied according to different types of soil, and methods such as ditch application, hole application, and concentrated application are adopted to fully exert fertilizer efficiency and prevent soil salinization.

Farmers of All Nationalities in Inner Mongolia Prepare Topdressing Fertilizer for 50 Million Mu of Crops

Since the Summer farming campaign in Inner Mongolia began, people's communes have been digging up various sources of fertilizer, readying to prepare top-dressing fertilizer for the 50 million mu of crops currently in cultivation.
Summer fertilizer campaigns are proceeding rapidly in such locales as Left Wing Central Banner of Horqin, Aohan Banner, and Zhuozi County, where the people have amassed 650 million catties of fertilizer including human manure, animal manure, kang soil, and grass ash, which will support the agricultural harvest this year.
In Wengniute Banner, where animal husbandry forms the majority of the economy, each commune has charged the herders with taking manure baskets and accumulating fertilizer in the pastures as they graze. They cleaned out cattle and sheep sheds and toilets, amassing 9 million catties of manure. Soil fertilizer plants in Arukorqin Banner and the suburbs of Chifeng City are quickly manufacturing a variety of chemical fertilizers using local materials, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, bone meal, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and antibiotics.
Inner Mongolia generally combines year-round fertilizer accumulation with seasonal blitzes, and collective accumulation with individual accumulation. As a result, the quantity is large and the quality is high.

Xin Di Commune Establishes Fertilizer Management System
Late Rice Fertilizer Can Be Supplied In Time

(Our newspaper, Nanning, 16th dispatch) Ti Pu Brigade of Xin Di Commune in Cangwu County, Guangxi, has established a complete set of detailed fertilizer management systems, basically achieving availability at any time of use, ensuring the needs of late rice.

This brigade has a lot of fertilizer after several blitzes. However, there is more coarse fertilizer and less refined fertilizer, and many soil fertilizers and miscellaneous fertilizers have not been composted. Ti Pu Brigade has recently focused on fertilizer management in improving operation and management, with very good results.

Cattle dung and cattle urine are important refined fertilizers. In the past, the team did not have a clear definition of responsibility, causing the keepers of the cattle to not gather cattle dung and urine, so the fertilizer flowed everywhere and the refined fertilizer was greatly lost. Thirty-seven dung pits were also unmanaged. Now, the brigade has adopted the method of "cattle-fixed fertilizer," appropriately stipulating how much fertilizer each cow produces per day; the excess part is bought by the production team for cash. The management of the dung pits adopts the method of "dung pit matching cattle," that is, all dung pits are assigned a quantity of fertilizer by matching the "cattle-fixed fertilizer" task, then matching cattle to each dung pit according to the size of the dung pit, and contracting it to the keepers for management. Fertilizer-accumulating work points are paid according to the distance of the dung pit and the amount of fertilizer accumulated. This can collect all the cattle dung, ensure that each dung pit is composted with fertilizer, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the keepers for fertilizer accumulation. The first day this method was implemented exceeded the original fertilizer accumulation task.

Household fertilizer is also one of the best fertilizers. In the past, many cadres felt that the quantity was small and insignificant, and they were unwilling to exchange at the same price, which dampened the enthusiasm of commune members to accumulate fertilizer. Now, this brigade resolutely implements the principle of "exchange at equal value, price purchase," and the production team sets up a full-time fertilizer worker to purchase commune members' farm manure according to quality and price. After doing so, the commune members are very satisfied, and their enthusiasm has greatly increased. The first production team received more than 1,300 dan of refined fertilizer in one day, many of which were refined fertilizers stored by the commune members; many commune members also automatically built sewage pits and bedpans to accumulate fertilizer.

The above methods only solve the supply of some refined fertilizers. The seedling root fertilizer (base fertilizer) for two crops a year must be further properly solved. Ti Pu Brigade decided to adopt the method of "task to household, contracted fertilizer production." The specific method is: "The production team orders the quantity of base fertilizer needed for two crops a year according to the plan, and then contracts the task, quality, and work points to the households according to the strength of the labor force, so that the commune members use the spare time in the morning and evening and the attached labor force at home to accumulate, compost, and sun the fertilizer.

In order to ensure the realization of the above methods, this production brigade has also established a "fertilizer file" managed by a special person. According to needs, each production team is assigned one to two fertilizer workers, each of whom is subsidized with 30 work points per month, and the specific tasks of the fertilizer workers are stipulated. At the same time, fertilizer ledgers are also established to publicize the completion of tasks and the work points to be issued, in order to promote commune members' fertilizer accumulation.

    积制精肥　增产粮食
    山西采用高温速成法沤肥
    山东利用废物大制土化肥
    本报太原16日电　山西省各地人民公社紧紧抓住当前肥源多，腐烂快的大好时机，开展了夏季积肥造肥运动，千方百计解决复播作物和大秋作物的肥料。
    晋北地区今年夏秋作物的种植面积，比去年扩大了五十万亩。为了保证做到勤追肥，多追肥，实现多种多收，全专区各地都大力开展了高温速成沤肥，大制土化肥和细菌肥料。仅宁武、河曲、阳高、朔县、忻定等县，在半个月内生产出的土化肥和细菌肥料，就相当于过去四个月的生产量。全区结合锄苗已给三百四十万亩秋田作物普遍施了一次追肥。晋东南地区近月来，采用高温堆肥法制肥，并大量搜集农家肥、厩肥和杂肥近一百亿斤。十五万亩底肥不足或受风雹侵袭的秋苗，都增施了追肥。许多地方的人民公社还因地制宜地积极建立了田头沤肥坑，修建厕所、牲畜圈，进行长年积肥。
    各地人民公社在积肥运动中，妥善地安排了劳动力和时间，建立了积肥造肥责任制度，实行干部包片，社员包干地块，保证按质按量、按时完成任务。同时贯彻了按劳付酬等办法，大大促进积肥运动的开展。晋中地区各人民公社社员们在积肥的同时，还实行了上地捎担肥的办法，已经把一千多万担复播作物的肥料提前送到地头。
    本报济南16日电　山东省夏季积肥、造肥初步形成高潮。现在全省参加积肥、造肥的劳力已增加到二百七十多万人，在完成春播施肥后的一个多月内，又积制了七百多亿斤追肥。
    今年山东省一万二千多万亩春夏作物，每亩需再追施标准圈肥二千斤。为了在夏秋之间的短时间内，积制出几千亿斤圈肥和大量土化肥，山东省各级党委都加强了积肥工作的领导，开展群众性的积肥、造肥、种肥、保肥运动。聊城、临沂两专区的积肥专业队，采取大搞土杂肥和各种化肥、养猪积肥、积人粪尿等办法，半个月内就沤积土杂肥二百五十八亿斤，制造大量菌肥和土化肥。齐河、高唐、范县、聊城等县市的人民公社，还抓紧麦收前的空隙，开展了一次人人动手，户户积肥的突击周。
    在大搞积肥、造肥中，各地党委都很重视土化肥的生产。现在全省的土化肥厂每月共可生产优质土化肥五到十亿斤。在制造土化肥中，各县的化肥厂还采取靠山取矿，沿海取卤，平原提硝、烟中取氮，废物利用等因地制宜的办法，就地取材，就地制造，就地利用，大大提高了土化肥的产量。
    为了帮助人民公社提高肥料质量，改进积肥、保肥和施肥的方法，各级党委积极组织农业、商业部门，省、专、县农业科学研究机关及高等院校的农业技术干部，深入到人民公社同群众一起总结和推广提高肥效的经验。烟台、聊城、临沂专区的人民公社，还推行了密封粪堆、改变人粪晒干的办法为浇稀办法，防止肥分挥发流失。在施追肥的方法上，氮磷钾适当配合，有机肥与无机肥适当配合，速效肥与迟效肥适当配合，根据不同性质的土壤施用不同性质的肥料，并采取沟施、穴施、集中施的办法，充分发挥了肥效，防止了土壤盐碱化。

    内蒙古各族农民为五千万亩农作物备追肥
    据新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古自治区各地人民公社结合夏季田间管理，普遍展开积肥造肥运动。目前，从西辽河流域到黄河后套平原，蒙古、汉、回、朝鲜等族社员，积极挖掘各种肥源，为刚种好的五千多万亩农作物准备追肥，保证今年农业大面积增产。
    夏季积肥运动进展较快的科尔沁左翼中旗、敖汉旗、卓资县等地，最近已积攒人粪、畜粪、炕土、草木灰等肥料六亿五千万斤。在畜牧业比重较大的翁牛特旗，各公社发动牛羊放牧员随身带上粪筐，一边放牧，一边就在牧场上积肥。清扫牲畜棚圈和厕所，积了九百万斤粪肥。阿鲁科尔沁旗、赤峰市郊区各公社的土化肥厂，利用当地多种多样的造肥原料，正在赶制大量氮磷钾、骨粉、固氮菌、抗菌素等化学肥料。
    内蒙古各地一般都注意采取常年积肥与季节突击积肥相结合，集体积肥与个人积肥相结合的方法。因此，积肥数量多，质量好。
    新地公社建立肥料管理制度
    晚造肥料能及时供应
    本报南宁16日电　广西苍梧县新地公社题铺大队，建立一整套细致的肥料管理制度，基本上做到随时用、随时有，保证了晚造的需要。
    这个大队经过几次突击，肥料是不少的。但是粗肥多精肥少，很多土肥杂肥也没有经过沤制，题铺大队最近在改进经营管理中，突出地抓肥料管理，效果很好。
    牛屎、牛尿，是重要的精肥，过去这个队由于责任不明确，造成饲养员不积牛屎，不接牛尿，粪坑没人管，精肥流失很大。三十七个粪坑，也无人管理。现在，大队采取“耕牛定肥”的办法，适当规定每头牛每天出多少肥；超额部分由生产队出现金收买。对粪坑的管理则采取“粪坑配牛”的办法，即所有粪坑按“耕牛定肥”任务，计算出各个粪坑该下多少肥，然后按粪坑大小搭配耕牛，包给饲养员管理。按粪坑远近、积肥多少，付给积肥工分。这样做一可全部收上牛粪；二可保证个个粪坑沤上肥料，三能发挥饲养员积肥积极性。这个办法实行的第一天超过了原定积肥任务。
    家肥，也是精肥之一。过去不少干部认为数量少，不足道，同时不愿等价交换，因此挫伤了社员积肥积极性。现在这个大队坚决贯彻了“等价交换，定价收买”的原则，由生产队设专职肥料员，按质作价，收买社员农家肥。这样做后社员很满意，积极性大大提高。第一生产队一天便收得精肥一千三百多担，其中有不少是社员存下的精肥；很多社员还自动建起污水坑和便桶来积肥。
    上述办法，只解决了部分精肥的供应。对一年两造的秧根粪（底肥），还必须进一步妥善解决。题铺大队决定采用“任务到户、包干制肥”的办法。具体做法是：“生产队按计划订出一年两造需要底肥的数量，然后按劳动力强弱包任务、包质量、包工分到户，使社员利用早晚空余时间和家里附带劳动力积、沤、晒肥。
    为了保证上述办法的实现，这个生产大队还建立了“肥料档案”由专人管理。根据需要，每个生产队设肥料员一至二人，每人每月补助工分三十分，并规定肥料员的具体任务。同时还建立肥料账簿，公布完成任务情况、应发工分，借以推动社员积肥。
