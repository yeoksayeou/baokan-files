Strengthen Production Labor and Improve Teaching Quality
Shi Ping, Vice President of Beijing Agricultural University

In late August of last year, our university decided that all faculty and students would go down to the countryside for a year. The university's 3,100 faculty and students were divided, with 400 remaining at the university to run factories and study "cutting-edge" agricultural science, 300 going to the university farm to improve farm production, and the remaining 2,400 divided into eight large teams and sent down to rural areas in eight provinces (regions, municipalities): Xushui in Hebei, Shouzhang and Fushan in Shandong, Xiping and Suiping in Henan, Qingxu and Hongzhao in Shanxi, Hainan, Haixi, and Xining in Qinghai, Yinchuan and Yanchi in Ningxia, Ba League and Xilin Gol League in Inner Mongolia, and suburban districts of Beijing. After arriving in the countryside, the faculty and students immediately threw themselves into the vigorous Great Leap Forward high tide, eating, living, and working alongside the peasants. For the first three months, the focus was on participating in production labor. After three months, teaching, scientific research, and production labor were closely integrated.

In our teaching and going-down process of more than a year, we have focused on exploring how to combine teaching with production labor and how to combine systematic theoretical teaching with on-site production teaching. We feel that it is essential to carry out a certain amount of production teaching in coordination with theoretical teaching. Now, we will talk about our gains and experiences in this regard.

Main Gains of Production Teaching

Since March of last year, our university moved to the new school buildings built on the university's large farm, implementing the practice of combining teaching with production labor. Faculty and students worked together in the school's classrooms, farms, and experimental fields, teaching and laboring simultaneously, focusing on systematic theoretical teaching in the classroom and closely integrating with the needs of professional teaching to carry out a certain amount of production labor. Through labor, we consolidated theory, learned production operations, and also tempered our thinking. After going down, we continued to explore the practice of production teaching. More than a year of practice has proven that the teaching effect is very good in the teaching of professional courses, especially when production teaching is closely integrated with production tasks.

Over the past year, our main gains in production teaching have been four points:

1.  Consolidated and strengthened theoretical knowledge, and learned production operation techniques in a down-to-earth manner. Faculty and students generally believe that learning is solid, in-depth, and flexible. It is not just knowing how to talk but not how to do, but knowing how to talk and how to do. For example, in the agricultural major's study of wheat cultivation, the teacher first gives a systematic lecture, followed by a series of production teaching activities. Students participated in labor such as land preparation, sowing, and field management at all stages, established a system of fixed-point observation and record-keeping archives; organized visits to veteran farmers, invited experienced farmers to give reports, and held symposiums with them; and conducted summaries and special discussions at each stage. Through these activities, students not only learned the complete set of cultivation methods but also had a very deep impression of the biological characteristics of wheat, its growth and development process, the adoption of various technical measures, and their effects. In the past, when students studied crop cultivation, they couldn't get into it and couldn't ask questions. Now they think that the content of cultivation is very rich and they are very interested. Li Qingfu, a junior in the Department of Agronomy, said: "In short, we learn comprehensively, truly, vividly, deeply, and thoroughly. I believe that learning in this way will be several times better than in the past." Under the guidance of teachers, students conducted a more in-depth study of the problem of wheat lodging. Students carefully observed and recorded the changes in wheat ecology, and analyzed the factors affecting lodging such as density, moisture, fertilization, varieties, and so on. Through these studies and explorations, they gained a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of wheat lodging, negated some simple and one-sided statements, and had a clearer view of controlling crop growth conditions and preventing lodging. Then, they studied rescue measures for the already lodged wheat and carried out rescue. During the rescue process, they observed, recorded, and analyzed again, and arranged various comparative experiments to further explore the problem.

Production teaching is thus through vivid production practice and scientific research practice, enriched and deepened understanding, and supplemented the shortcomings of pure systematic theoretical teaching. Students delve into production, face the various complex factors in production, sort out and analyze, propose solutions, and verify theories in practice to improve understanding. This is naturally much more solid, in-depth, and flexible than pure theoretical study.

2.  Summarized the rich harvest experience of farmers and enriched the teaching content. In many going-down points, teachers guided senior students to systematically summarize the rich harvest experience of farmers. For example, the sesame part of the past cultivation, lack of information, the content is not rich, teachers and students who went down in Suiping, summarized the local sesame cultivation experience, teaching content is much richer. In addition, the production experience of many other crops and livestock, and the experience of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine have been summarized.

3.  Learned the skills of organizing and leading production, and greatly improved the ability of independent thinking and independent work. Students majoring in plant protection who went down to Shouzhang served as assistants to production team leaders in order to carry out the work of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. In each production team, they set up plant protection groups to carry out the investigation and control of diseases and insect pests. Students take on actual work, they need to understand the situation, formulate plans, consult with the masses, ask for instructions from higher authorities, and organize the local plan into the overall work plan; to publicize, to mobilize the masses, to solve problems at any time, to summarize, to report, and so on. All this work is carried out in the production team, in the commune, in the collective, in the masses, is a very complex matter. Therefore, many students who participated in the work of organizing production learned a whole set of organizational and leadership skills, greatly strengthened the ability of independent thinking and independent work.

4.  Cultivated the feelings of loving farmers, loving agricultural production, and loving the profession. Students are constantly in contact with production in production teaching, working with farmers, rejoicing in the rich harvest, and worrying about the problems that occur in production. The results of production contain the labor of students. Therefore, some students who were indifferent to production gradually changed from indifference to love. Students deeply felt the urgent need to equip production with modern science and technology in production. Therefore, they increased their sense of responsibility and honor in learning agricultural science. Not only consolidated the professional thinking of studying agriculture, but also greatly strengthened the world outlook of serving the socialist cause wholeheartedly.

The above four aspects of harvest, is not available in classroom teaching. Students have the systematic theoretical equipment of classroom teaching, and through production teaching, consolidated theoretical knowledge, learned the production operation technology and the ability to organize and lead production; With the world outlook of serving the socialist construction wholeheartedly, such students after graduation, must be lively, can adapt to the needs of national construction talent. In addition, the implementation of production teaching, both trained students, but also improve the teachers, from overcoming the shortcomings of teaching away from production reality, the teacher's gains, is more important.

The Importance of Production Teaching to Agricultural Education

"Combining education with productive labor" in higher agricultural schools, the main practice is to combine the systematic theoretical teaching of the classroom with the on-site production teaching. On-site production teaching has limitations in teaching materials, in time, space, and environmental conditions, therefore, production teaching can not replace systematic theoretical teaching. The main significance of production teaching is practice. Practice is the touchstone of any theory, so the teaching of theory must be matched with the teaching of practice. This cooperation is of particular importance to higher agricultural education. Because agricultural education has three characteristics. These three characteristics are:

First, agricultural education is to equip students with agricultural science and technology. The object of agricultural science and technology research is the production of agricultural animals and plants. Animals and plants are the unified products of organic matter and external environmental conditions. Therefore, agricultural production has a large range of regionality. Within a small area, this piece of land and that piece of land, its soil, moisture, biological environment, etc., are different, and are constantly changing. Different regions cultivate different varieties of crops, and raise different varieties of livestock. Agricultural production is so varied, ever-changing, rich and colorful, and lively. Obviously, the systematic theory of classroom teaching is only a generalization of the general commonality of biology, therefore, to learn how to correctly apply production technology under varied conditions, you have to go to production practice.

Second, agricultural production is carried out in the vast countryside. For thousands of years, the vast laboring people of our country have accumulated a wealth of production experience, which is an important source of enriching and developing our country's agricultural science. The vast number of farmers are directly inheriting this experience and applying and continuously developing this experience. We must learn the good things of foreign countries, but also learn our own good things, therefore, we must go to the countryside, to production.

Third, agricultural production is a combination of natural reproduction and social reproduction. In our country is the socialist large-scale production, science and technology must be through the organization of the people's commune, farms, in order to actually play a role in production. Therefore, students in learning natural science, but also must go to the actual production to learn the knowledge of organizing production, leading production and management of production.

From the above three characteristics of agricultural education, it can be seen that: to cultivate "agronomists" who can speak and do, we must closely combine the teaching process with production practice. In addition to the systematic theoretical teaching in the classroom, it is also necessary to carry out a sufficient amount of production teaching.

Production Teaching Must Be Organized, Planned, and Systematically Conducted

In the composition of our past teaching plan, there is a part of production teaching, but if measured by the requirements of combining education with productive labor, then, it has three obvious shortcomings: One shortcoming is that teachers and students who carry out production teaching, participate in less actual productive labor, and do not go deeply into production; The second shortcoming is that the "production teaching" is mainly to verify the theory of classroom teaching, which is necessary. However, at that time, we did not seriously learn the rich experience of farmers. Therefore, often what should be learned cannot be learned, and what can be learned is not learned; The third shortcoming is that the time for production teaching is less, students did not participate in a complete production process in the whole learning process, so, the actual production knowledge, is not learned completely. Due to the existence of these three shortcomings, therefore, the production teaching we carried out in the past, did not meet the requirements of "combining teaching with productive labor". According to the new requirements, in the future, the organization of production teaching must be: First, teachers and students participate in productive labor in person; Second, production teaching is to test the reliability of theory through production practice, through learning farmers' experience, so the process of production teaching must coincide with the process of actual production; Third, the time for production teaching should be increased more than in the past, and there should be a complete production full process of production teaching. How to combine education with productive labor, how to concretize theoretical teaching and production teaching. We have had some preliminary experiences and practices:

1.  According to the learning needs of different majors and different grades, choose different occasions for production teaching. Generally speaking, low-grade students are more convenient in the school farm, high-grade students are better to go out, choose agricultural and animal husbandry production and people's commune organization is more advanced, local party and government leadership is stronger areas, as the site of production teaching, you can learn more, learn better. For example, Qingxu County, Shanxi Province, is famous for growing grapes, with a grape yield of 28,000 catties per mu, so we sent a part of senior students majoring in fruit trees to there; For example, two senior students from the Department of Animal Husbandry were sent to learn from Ning Huatang, a nationally famous sheep-raising expert, and so on.

2.  After selecting the site for on-site teaching, since any "point" cannot meet all the needs of teaching, it is necessary to create conditions that are indispensable for production teaching at the "point". In the fixed going-down point, it is necessary to plan to arrange it as a base for the three combinations of teaching, production, and research. The teaching work on this base should be closely combined with the local production tasks, if possible, it is best to combine them into one, which can both complete the local production tasks, but also complete the teaching tasks. An important advantage of doing so is that you can get the close leadership of the local Party and government. For example, in Xushui County, our teaching and research work is unified with the county party committee's task of studying "high-yield technical measures for winter wheat," focusing on the county party committee's focus, and teachers and students personally participate in labor and conduct in-depth comprehensive research in accordance with the "Eight-Character Constitution". In addition, people were sent to participate in the county party committee's science and technology office, to grasp the "surface" and assist the county party committee to comprehensively analyze the county's wheat production situation, and study the common law from the general. Doing so helps the local production and makes our production teaching serious and down-to-earth.

3.  Production teaching is not to teach whatever you encounter temporarily, but to formulate plans in advance according to the teaching content, procedures, and needs, and proceed step by step according to the plan. First, production teaching should include three contents: One is to meet the needs of classroom teaching, so that students can consolidate and master the theoretical knowledge of science and technology, and at the same time seriously summarize the rich harvest experience of farmers, in order to test and enrich theoretical knowledge; The second is to learn and master production operation technology and the ability to organize and lead production; The third is labor. For the whole production teaching, these three contents are indispensable. Second, production teaching can not replace the entire systematic theoretical teaching of the classroom, the teaching plan, the systematic classroom teaching is the main part. Production teaching can only account for a certain proportion according to the nature of different majors. Third, the process of production teaching should not only coincide with the actual production process, but also take into account the sequence of theoretical teaching, so that it is easy to learn while doing, and cooperate with each other.

4.  To do a good job in production teaching, it is necessary to do three main preparation work: First, on-site preparation. Teachers should first conduct an investigation of the site to see if it is suitable for teaching, if some additional comparative living materials are needed, then they should be moved from elsewhere in advance, or even need to be planted a few months ago; Second, in order to make the on-site knowledge more systematic, and learn more clearly, it is necessary to carry out the necessary preparation of teaching aids and wall charts, so that production teaching in addition to absorbing direct experience, as far as possible to deepen theoretical understanding; Third, the preparation of teaching content. This is the most difficult work, is the key to the success of on-site teaching. First of all, teachers should make full preparation for lessons in theory; Secondly, to be familiar with the on-site production process and the current situation; Again, to visit the old farmers to collect mass experience, and to rise these experiences to the theory to explain; Also, if teaching to invite local labor models to make a report, the teacher should first help the labor model to prepare the report content, so that the report can grasp the center according to the needs of students, clearly introduce his experience. In short, on-site teaching is very flexible, but teachers must avoid fighting unprepared battles.

In our experience in organizing production teaching, one issue must be given sufficient attention. That is, we must not only give full play to the spirit of "teaching and learning from each other," but also ensure that teachers play a leading role. In production teaching, we must give full play to the initiative of teachers, who are actively responsible, so that production teaching can be carried out with preparation and leadership, and ensure quality.

Continue to Strengthen Production Teaching

Continuously Improve Teaching Quality

Under the implementation of the Party's policy of "combining education with productive labor," we have achieved certain results in combining theoretical teaching with production teaching. However, production teaching is a new issue, and the little experience that has been explored in a year is only very preliminary and needs to be explored continuously, deeply, and meticulously, and continuously improved. The necessity of production teaching and its good results can be affirmed. How to strengthen it in the future, so that the quality of teaching can be continuously improved, so far, we believe that: In addition to adhering to this practice and continuing to improve the understanding of this practice among teachers and students, we must do work in four areas:

First, we must continue to insist that teachers must be closely connected with production reality. The going-down over the past year has brought teachers into close contact with actual production, making many farmer friends. Being familiar with the rural situation and obtaining rich practical materials are valuable results brought about by the "going-down" and the great revolution in education, and we must consolidate it and adhere to it. We must also prevent the recurrence of the problem of theory being divorced from reality. This is indispensable for continuously improving the quality of teaching.

Second, we will further build some of the going-down points into permanent bases for the three combinations of teaching, research, and production in the school. According to the needs of different majors, we will also plan to establish some new three-combination bases. Together, we will establish a three-combination "base network" of a necessary scale. This will not only be good for the school's teaching and scientific research, but also good for agricultural production.

Third, we will further run the school's more than 20,000 mu of farms well, so that it can greatly exert its due advanced and demonstrative role in agricultural production, and play a "central" role in the school's three-combination "base network".

Fourth, we will sort out the existing experience and formulate production teaching syllabuses for various majors, so that production teaching will be further systematized.

    加强生产劳动　提高教学质量
    北京农业大学副校长　施平
    去年8月下旬，我们学校决定全体师生下放农村一年。全校师生三千一百人，除四百人留校办工厂和钻研农业科学“尖端”，三百人下学校农场搞好农场生产外，其余二千四百人，分成八个大队，下放到八个省（区、市）的农村，即河北的徐水，山东的寿张、福山，河南的西平、遂平，山西的清徐、洪赵，青海的海南、海西、西宁，宁夏的银川、盐池，内蒙古的巴盟、锡盟，北京市郊各区。师生们到达农村后，立即投入了轰轰烈烈的大跃进高潮，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动。最初三个月，以参加生产劳动为主，三个月后，教学、科学研究、生产劳动三个工作密切结合进行。
    在我们一年多来的教学和下放过程中，我们着重地探索教学如何与生产劳动相结合，系统的理论教学如何与现场的生产教学相结合。我们觉得，配合理论教学，进行一定的生产教学是十分必要的。现在我们谈谈这方面的收获与体会。
    生产教学的主要收获
    从去年3月起，我们学校就搬到盖在学校大农场上的新校舍中，实行教学与生产劳动相结合的做法，师生一道，在学校的课堂、农场和试验地上，边教学边劳动，以课堂的系统理论教学为主，密切结合专业教学的需要，进行一定分量的生产劳动，通过劳动，巩固理论，学习生产操作，同时也锻炼了思想。下放以后，我们继续探索生产教学的做法，一年多来的实践证明，在专业课程的教学中，尤其是当把生产教学与生产任务密切地结合起来的时候，教学效果很好。
    一年多来，我们进行生产教学的主要收获有四点：
    1．巩固和加强了理论知识，踏实地学到了生产操作技术。师生普遍认为学习的牢固、深入和灵活。不是会说不会做，而是会说又会做。例如，农学专业学习小麦的栽培，首先由教师进行系统讲授，以后便是一系列的生产教学活动。学生参加了整地、播种和各阶段田间管理的劳动，建立了定点观察、记载档案的制度；组织了向老农的访问，请有经验的农民作报告，并与他们开座谈会；进行了各阶段的总结和专题讨论。通过了这些活动，学生不仅学会了全套栽培方法，而且对小麦的生物学特性，生长发育过程，各种技术措施的采用和它的效果，都有了很深刻的印象。过去，学生学习作物栽培学时，钻不进去，提不出问题，现在则认为栽培学内容非常丰富，兴趣很大。农学系三年级学生李庆付说：“总之是学得全、真、活、深、透，相信这样学下去，会比过去好几倍。”在教师的指导下，学生们对小麦倒伏问题进行了较深入的研究。学生们细致地观察和记载了小麦生态的变化，分析了影响倒伏的密度、水分、施肥、品种等等因素。通过这些研究探讨，对小麦倒伏的原因有了比较全面的认识，否定了某些简单片面的说法；对控制作物的生长条件，防止倒伏，有了比较明确的看法。接着，对已经倒伏的小麦研究抢救措施，进行抢救。抢救过程中再观察、记载、分析，并布置各种对比试验，来对问题作进一步的探讨。
    生产教学就是这样通过了生动的生产实践和科学研究的实践，丰富了和深化了认识，补充了单纯的系统理论教学的不足。学生深入生产、面对生产中的各种复杂因素，整理分析，提出办法，并在实践中验证理论，提高认识。这样自然比单纯的理论学习要牢固得多，深入得多和灵活得多。
    2．总结了农民的丰产经验，充实了教学内容。在许多下放点上，教师指导着高年级学生，系统地总结了农民的丰产经验。如过去栽培学中芝麻的部分，缺少资料，内容不充实，下放在遂平的师生，总结了当地芝麻栽培的经验，教学内容就丰富了许多。此外，对其他许多种作物、家畜的生产经验和中兽医的经验都作了总结。
    3．学到了组织领导生产的本领，大大提高了独立思考、独立工作能力。下放到寿张的植物保护专业学生，为了开展防治病虫害的工作，担任了生产队长助手，在各生产队里，成立了植物保护小组，开展了病虫的调查和防治工作。学生担任了实际工作，就要了解情况，拟订计划，向群众商量，向上级请示，把局部的计划组织到整个的工作计划中去；要宣传、要发动群众，要随时解决问题，要总结，要报告，等等。这一切工作都是在生产队，在公社，在集体、群众中进行的，是很复杂的事。因此，许多学生参加了组织生产的工作后，就学习了一整套组织领导的本领，大大地加强了独立思考和独立工作能力。
    4．培养了热爱农民，热爱农业生产和热爱专业的情感。学生在生产教学中时时刻刻接触生产，和农民一起劳动，一起为丰产而高兴，为生产中发生的问题而着急。生产的成果包含着学生的劳动。因此，有些对生产冷淡的学生，逐渐从冷淡变为热爱。学生们在生产中深深感到迫切需要用现代科学技术来装备生产。因此，增加了他们学习农业科学的责任感和光荣感。不但巩固了学农的专业思想，而且还大大地加强了全心全意为建设社会主义事业服务的人生观。
    以上四方面的收获，是课堂教学中得不到的。学生有了课堂教学的系统理论装备，又通过生产教学，巩固了理论知识，学到了生产操作技术和组织领导生产的本事；有了全心全意为社会主义建设服务的人生观，这样的学生毕业后，必定是生龙活虎的、能适应于国家建设需要的人材。此外，实行生产教学，既培养了学生，也提高了教师，从克服教学脱离生产实际的缺点来说，教师方面的收获，是更为重要的。
          生产教学对农业教育的重要性
      “教育与生产劳动相结合”，在高等农业学校中的主要做法，就是实行课堂的系统理论教学和现场的生产教学相结合。现场的生产教学，在教学材料上，在时间、空间以及环境条件上，都有局限性，因此，生产教学不能代替系统理论教学。生产教学的主要意义是实践。实践是任何理论的试金石，所以理论的教学、必须有实践的教学相配合。这种配合，对于高等农业教育有特别重要的意义。因为农业教育有三个特点。这三个特点是：
    第一，农业教育是用农业科学技术装备学生的。农业科学技术研究的对象，是农业动物和植物的生产。动、植物都是有机体和外界环境条件统一的产物。所以，农业生产有较大范围的地区性。就在一个小区内，这块地和那块地，它的土壤、水分、生物环境等等，都有所不同，而且在不断地变化着。不同地区栽培作物的品种不一样，饲养家畜的品种也不同，农业生产就是这样千差万别、变化多端、丰富多采和生动活泼。很显然，课堂教学的系统理论只是生物一般共性的概括，因此，要学习怎样在千差万别的条件下正确地运用生产技术，就非到生产实际中去不可。
    第二，农业生产是在广大农村中进行的。几千年来，我国广大劳动人民积累了十分丰富的生产经验，这些经验是丰富和发展我国农业科学的重要源泉。直接继承这些经验，应用和不断发展这些经验的是广大农民。我们要学外国的好东西，也要学自己的好东西，因此，就必须到农村中去，到生产中去。
    第三，农业生产是自然再生产和社会再生产的结合。在我国是社会主义的大生产，科学技术必须通过人民公社、农场的组织，才能实际在生产中起作用。因此，学生在学习自然科学外，还必须到实际生产中去学习组织生产、领导生产和经营管理生产的知识。
    从上述农业教育三个特点看出：要培养出能说能做的“农学家”，就必须使教学过程和生产实际密切结合起来。在课堂的系统理论教学外，还要进行足够分量的生产教学。
    生产教学必须有组织、有计划、有系统地进行
    在我们过去的教学计划组成中，有生产教学的部分，但是，如果用教育与生产劳动相结合的要求来衡量，那末，它存在着三个显明的缺点：一个缺点是，进行生产教学的师生，参加实际生产劳动较少，深入生产中去是作得不够的；第二个缺点是，那种“生产教学”主要是去验证课堂教学的理论，这是必要的。但是，那时对农民的丰富经验没有认真地去学习。因此，常常是要学的学不到，能学到的东西不学；第三个缺点是，生产教学的时间较少，学生在全部学习过程中，没有参加过一个完整的生产过程，这样，对实际的生产知识，就学的不完整。由于存在着这三个缺点，所以，从前我们进行的生产教学，达不到“教学与生产劳动相结合”的要求。按照新的要求，今后组织生产教学，必须是：第一，师生亲自参加生产劳动；第二，生产教学是通过生产实践，通过学习农民经验，去考验理论的可靠性，因而进行生产教学的过程，必须和实际生产的过程吻合起来；第三，生产教学的时间要比过去加多一些，要有完整的生产全过程的生产教学。如何使教育与生产劳动结合，如何使理论教学与生产教学具体化。我们有了下面的一些初步的经验和作法：
    1．根据不同专业、不同年级的学习需要，选择不同的生产教学场合。一般说，低年级学生以在学校农场比较方便，高年级学生以外出为好，选择农、牧业生产及人民公社组织比较先进、当地党政领导比较强的地区，作为生产教学的现场，可以学得多些、学得好些。例如，山西清徐县，种葡萄著名，亩产葡萄达二万八千斤，我们就把果树专业的高年级学生下放一部分到那里；又如，派遣了两名畜牧系高年级的学生，向全国著名的养羊专家宁华堂学习，等等。
    2、选定了现场教学的点以后，由于任何一个“点”，都不可能满足教学上的一切需要，所以，要在“点”上创设那些对生产教学必不可少的条件。在固定的下放点上，要有计划地把它布置成为教学、生产、研究三结合的基地。这个基地上的教学工作，要和当地的生产任务密切结合起来，有可能的话，最好把它们合而为一，这就能够既完成了当地的生产任务，也完成了教学任务。这样做的一个重要好处是，可以得到当地党、政的密切领导。例如，在徐水县，我们的教学和研究工作和县委研究“冬小麦丰产技术措施”的任务统一起来，以县委的重点为重点，师生亲自参加劳动，按“八字宪法”深入地进行综合研究。另外，还派人参加县委的科学技术办公室，抓“面”，协助县委综合分析全县有关小麦的生产情况，从一般中研究共同规律。这样做，对当地的生产有帮助，也使我们的生产教学进行得认真、踏实。
    3．生产教学并不是临时碰上什么教什么，而是要按照教学的内容、程序和需要，事先拟订计划，按计划有步骤地进行。第一，生产教学要包括三个内容：一是配合课堂教学的需要，使学生巩固掌握科学技术的理论知识，同时认真地总结农民的丰产经验，以检验和丰富理论知识；二是学习掌握生产操作技术和组织领导生产的能力；三是劳动。就整个的生产教学来说，这三个内容是缺一不可的。第二，生产教学不能代替整个的课堂的系统理论教学，教学计划上，系统的课堂教学是主要的部分。生产教学只能根据不同专业的性质占一定的比例。第三，进行生产教学的过程，既要和实际的生产过程相吻合，还要照顾到理论教学的顺序性，这样才便于边做边学，互相配合。
    4．要搞好生产教学，必须做好三个主要的准备工作：第一，现场准备。教师要先对现场进行调查，看看是否适宜于进行教学，如果是需要另外一些对比的活材料，那就要事先由别处搬来，甚至需要在几个月前就把它种上；第二，为了使现场的知识比较系统化，学习得更清楚，就需要进行必要的教具和挂图的准备，使生产教学除了吸取直接经验之外，还尽可能加深理论认识；第三，教学内容的准备。这是最繁重的工作，是现场教学成效大小的关键。首先，教师要在理论上作充分备课；其次，要熟悉地掌握现场上的生产过程和当前情况；再次，要访问老农搜集群众经验，并且把这些经验上升到理论上来说明；还有，假如教学时要请当地劳动模范作报告，教师就要事先帮助劳动模范准备报告内容，使报告能根据学生的需要抓住中心，明确地介绍出他的经验。总之，现场的教学虽然是很灵活的，但教师切忌打无准备的仗。
    在我们组织生产教学的经验中，有一个问题必须引起足够的注意。这就是，既要充分发挥“教学相长”的精神，又要教师确实起主导作用。在生产教学中，必须充分发挥教师的积极性，由教师积极负责，才能使生产教学有准备、有领导地进行，保证质量。
    继续加强生产教学
    不断提高教学质量
    在贯彻执行党的“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针下，我们结合理论教学进行了生产教学，已经取得一定的成绩。但是生产教学是一个新的问题，一年来，摸索到的一点经验，只是很初步的，需要继续深入细致地摸索，不断地提高。生产教学的必要性和它的良好效果，是可以肯定的了，今后如何加强它，使教学质量不断得到提高，截至目前为止，我们认为：除了坚持这个做法，继续提高师生中这个做法的认识以外，要做四个方面的工作：
    第一，要继续坚持教师必需与生产实际密切联系。一年来的下放，教师和实际生产发生了密切的联系，交了许多农民朋友。熟悉了农村情况，得到了丰富的实际材料，这是“下放”和教育大革命带来的宝贵成果，必须使它巩固起来，坚持下去。还要防止理论脱离实际的毛病复发。这是不断提高教学质量所不可缺少的。
    第二，我们要把一些下放点进一步建成学校永久性的教学、研究、生产三结合的基地。根据不同专业的需要，还要有计划地建立一些新的三结合基地。合起来建立一个有必要规模的三结合“基地网”。这样，不但对学校的教学、科学研究有好处，而且对农业生产也将有好处。
    第三，进一步办好学校的两万多亩农场，使它大大发挥在农业生产中应有的先进和示范作用，在学校三结合的“基地网”中起“中心”的作用。
    第四，整理现有的经验，制定出各专业的生产教学大纲，使生产教学进一步系统化。
