(By our Wuhan dispatch, June 28) Various regions in Hubei Province are taking measures to strengthen leadership over the handicraft industry, vigorously organizing handicraft industries to produce various daily necessities urgently needed by the people. Many counties, cities, towns, and people's communes are conducting investigations and research into handicraft production and market supply, and arranging handicraft production according to market needs.

After the merger of factories and transformation into communes in the Great Leap Forward last year, the handicraft industry in various parts of Hubei Province improved production efficiency and powerfully supported industrial and agricultural production. However, some industries were reduced after the merger; after some handicraft cooperatives were merged into large factories, they only paid attention to arranging the production of relatively large and high-end products, neglecting the production of small products needed for people's lives; some handicraft workers transferred to other industries. In addition, due to insufficient supply of raw materials, the supply of some daily necessities in the market is tight.

In order to meet the market's need for handicraft products, many regions are, under the principle of voluntary participation by handicraftsmen, planning to adjust some of the handicraft factories that were merged or transformed, separating out industries suitable for decentralized production, and adopting methods of personnel returning to their posts and masters taking their places to restore some of the original handicraft industries and products according to market needs. At the same time, many regions have also held handicraft symposiums and handicraft representative conferences, and by analyzing market conditions and people's needs, they have reversed the thinking of some people who were unwilling to produce scattered, small-value daily necessities. According to statistics from six counties including Echeng, Xishui, and Macheng in the Huanggang Special District, more than 120 industries have been restored, and more than 7,300 handicraftsmen have returned to their original posts; 1,139 kinds of handicraft products have been restored. Huangzhou Town, Huanggang County, adjusted three factories that were improperly merged and had too many people into ten factories and cooperatives. After the handicraft industries such as raw wood, bamboo ware, sheet metal, and bicycle repair, which were originally merged into the farm tool factory, were re-separated, many products that were originally squeezed out were restored, and the variety of products in the town increased from 662 to 863. More than 1,500 pieces of products such as pot shovels, fire tongs, kitchen knives, vegetable baskets, bathtubs, and buckets, which were lacking in the market, were produced in a concentrated effort. Yingcheng County also organized more than 200 coppersmiths, blacksmiths, bamboo craftsmen, and stonemasons to go to the countryside to repair old items. In a short period of time, they repaired more than 50,000 pieces of household utensils, which not only facilitated the masses but also made up for the shortage of market product supply.

In order to support the production of daily necessities, Hubei Province, special districts, counties, and cities have allocated various raw materials such as steel, copper, silicon steel sheets, Phoebe bamboo, wood, and cotton yarn, some of which have been distributed to factories and cooperatives. Various regions have also vigorously mobilized and relied on the masses, implemented industrial and commercial cooperation, and purchased local specialty products, waste products, and cleared warehouses to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. The Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Department, on the one hand, adopted the method of processing orders to arrange the production of small commodities, and on the other hand, together with the Municipal Waste Products Wholesale Department, transferred special personnel to form a commando team to find raw materials, adopting the method of searching every warehouse, combining accounts and goods, and implementing them item by item. In just three days, they found 69.3 tons of various raw materials. These materials can be used to produce 35,000 umbrellas, 70,000 umbrella handles, 4,000 catties of hairpins, 4.5 tons of packaging nails, and 70,000 dozen toys.

    湖北统筹兼顾全面安排  人员归队师傅就位
    大力恢复手工业  增产当令日用品
    本报武汉28日电　湖北省各地采取措施，加强对手工业的领导，大力组织手工业行业生产人民迫切需要的各种生活日用品。很多县、市、镇和人民公社，一面调查研究手工业生产和市场供应情况，一面根据市场需要安排手工业生产。
    湖北省各地手工业在去年大跃进中并厂转社以后，提高了生产效率，有力地支援了工农业生产。但是，合并后有些行业减少；有些手工业社合并为大厂以后，只注意安排比较大的、高级的产品，忽视了群众生活需要的小产品生产；有些手工业工人转入了别的行业。此外由于原材料供应不足，市场上部分生活日用品供应紧张。
    为了满足市场对手工业产品的需要，许多地区在手工业者自愿的原则下，正有计划地调整部分并社转厂的手工业工厂，将适宜分散生产的行业分出经营，根据市场需要，采取人员归队、师傅就位的办法，恢复一些原有的手工业行业和产品。与此同时，许多地区还召开了手工业座谈会和手工业代表大会，通过分析市场情况和人民需要，扭转了部分人不愿生产零零星星、产值微小的日用品的思想。据黄冈专区鄂城、浠水、麻城等六个县的统计，已恢复了一百二十多个行业，有七千三百多名手工业者回到原岗位；恢复了一千一百三十九种手工业产品。黄冈县黄州镇把原来并之不当、人数过多的三个工厂，调整为十个厂、社。原来并入农具厂的元木、竹器、白铁、脚踏车修理等手工业行业重新分出后，许多原来被挤掉的产品恢复了，全镇产品品种由原来六百六十二种增加到八百六十三种，突击生产了市场上缺乏的锅铲、火钳、菜刀、菜篮、澡盆、水桶等产品一千五百多件。应城县还组织了二百多个铜匠、铁匠、篾工、石工下乡修旧，在短短的时间里，即整修好生活用具五万多件，既便利了群众，又弥补了市场产品供应的不足。
    为支持生活日用品的生产，湖北省、专区、县、市已调拨了各种原料如钢材、铜、矽钢片、楠竹、木材、棉纱，有的已分配到厂、社。各地还大力发动和依靠群众，实行工商协作，收购当地土特产品，废品，清理仓库，来克服原材料不足的困难。武汉百货批发部一面采取加工订货的方式，安排小商品生产，一面和市废品批发部一起，抽调专人组成一个找寻原材料的突击队，采取库库跑遍、账货结合、件件落实的办法，仅三天时间，即找到了各种原材料六十九点三吨。用这些材料可以生产洋伞三万五千把、配伞胡芦七万个、发夹四千斤、包装钉子四吨半、玩具七万打。
