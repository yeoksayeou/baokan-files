Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, Electric Dispatch. The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic recently approved a plan for the socialist transformation of the construction industry. This plan is based on the outline for the development of the construction industry proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and the resolutions of the Third Construction Industry Conference.

When reporting at the meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Minister of Construction, Ernst Scholz, pointed out that the Third Construction Industry Conference marked the beginning of a new stage of development for the socialist construction industry. At present, it is important to achieve the highest possible level of science and technology through the work of socialist collectives. Special efforts must be made to ensure the satisfactory completion of large-scale projects, especially those in the chemical, coal mining, and power industries. At the same time, attention must also be paid to the implementation of the residential housing and school building plans, as well as the agricultural building plans.

He said that the Third Construction Industry Conference laid the foundation for construction workers to discuss the socialist transformation of the construction industry. This transformation is about to take place in order to complete the seven-year plan for the development of the construction industry and contribute to the completion of the country's main economic tasks.

The meeting emphasized the timely selection of sites for future projects, emphasized the use of new and repeatedly tested technical methods, the promotion of multi-shift systems in the construction industry, the establishment of absolutely correct standards for the use of raw materials, and the rational use of all machinery, in order to increase labor productivity and reduce production costs.

The Council of Ministers called on all possible measures to be taken to implement the resolutions adopted by the Third Construction Industry Conference and pointed out that the current urgent task is to complete the 1959 plan and prepare next year's plan.

    德意志民主共和国部长会议通过计划
    实现建筑业社会主义改建
    新华社柏林电　德意志民主共和国部长会议最近通过了建筑业社会主义改建计划。这个计划是以德国统一社会党中央政治局提出的关于建筑业发展的提纲和第三届建筑业会议的决议为基础的。
    建设部部长恩斯特·绍尔茨在部长会议的会议上作报告时指出，第三届建筑业会议是社会主义建筑工业新的发展阶段的开始。目前，重要的是，靠社会主义集体的工作，来达到可能达到的最高科学技术水平。必须特别努力保证大规模的工程，特别是化学、采煤和电力工业中的工程能令人满意地完成。同时也必须注意执行居民住宅和学校校舍建筑计划以及农业用房建筑计划。
    他说，第三届建筑业会议为建筑工作者讨论建筑工业社会主义改建的问题奠定了基础。这种改建即将进行，以便能完成建筑业发展的七年计划和为完成国家主要经济任务作出贡献。
    会议强调要按时选定未来工程的地点，强调利用新的和经过多次试验的技术方法，在建筑工业中推广多班制，规定原料使用的绝对正确的标准和合理地使用一切机器，以便提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本。
    部长会议号召采取一切可能的措施来实现第三届建筑业会议所通过的决议，并且指出，当前迫切的任务是完成1959年计划和准备下年度计划。
