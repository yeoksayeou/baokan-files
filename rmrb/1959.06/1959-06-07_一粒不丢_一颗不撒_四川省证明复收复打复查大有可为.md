This newspaper, Chengdu, 6th dispatch: The millions of people in Sichuan Province's summer harvest army, without removing their armor and without stopping their horses, after harvesting more than 40 million mu of minor spring crops, launched a concentrated campaign of re-harvesting, re-threshing, and re-inspection in one go.

This re-harvesting, re-threshing, and re-inspection movement has been very effective. After re-harvesting and re-threshing, each mu of wheat in Wenjiang Special District's communes generally yielded about fifteen more jin; each mu of rapeseed yielded more than twenty jin. Neijiang Special District has now recovered more than 5 million jin of minor spring grains such as wheat, peas, and broad beans. Neijiang, Zizhong, Lezhi, Weiyuan and other counties have also picked up more than 3 million jin of sweet potatoes left in the fields last year that were not completely harvested.

In order to cut cleanly, harvest cleanly, thresh cleanly, and pick up cleanly, Yan Xiufeng, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and the Pixian County Party Committee inspection team re-threshed and re-sieved a piece of already threshed and sieved rapeseed "empty panicles" and "empty pods" in Chongxing Commune. As a result, 34 jin of rapeseed were re-threshed from one mu of "empty panicles" and "empty pods," plus those swept and picked up from the fields and field edges, totaling 40 jin and 11 liang. According to typical surveys in various places, about 15 jin of wheat per mu are scattered; between 15 jin and 20 jin of rapeseed per mu are scattered. This is an alarming figure.

In late May, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee issued an urgent directive, demanding that all localities immediately take effective measures to recover the scattered grain. Party committee secretaries and rural cadres at all levels personally participated in re-threshing, setting an example. Neijiang, Rongxian, Zizhong and other counties held on-site meetings for re-threshing and re-harvesting of minor spring crops from top to bottom, level by level. By conducting three checks "checking the harvested land, checking empty panicles, and checking the threshing floor," they cleared up the situation of scattering and waste, and used vivid and specific examples to educate the masses, so that cadres and commune members realized that scattering and waste caused great damage to the country, the commune, and their own improved lives. Therefore, the re-harvesting and re-threshing movement became a conscious action of the masses.

In the re-threshing and re-harvesting movement, various localities made proper arrangements for labor, organized professional teams, and adopted a short-term concentrated approach. After comprehensively arranging the summer harvest and summer planting labor force, the communes in Lezhi County extracted more than 38,000 incidental laborers and children to form more than 2,000 re-harvesting and re-threshing shock teams, closely cooperating with the harvesting to ensure that one piece is harvested and one piece is picked up, one threshing is done and one cleaning is done, and each piece is passed successfully. The whole county picked up more than 250,000 jin of grain. The communes in Wanxian County transferred 52,000 people, using rest and gap time, seizing every opportunity, and carrying out a small movement week lasting three to five days, concentrating their efforts to attack the scattering problem, recovering 142,500 jin of scattered grain. In addition, various localities have also established inspection and acceptance and appraisal and reward systems, which have greatly promoted the movement.

### 一粒不丢  一颗不撒  四川省证明复收复打复查大有可为

    一粒不丢  一颗不撒
    四川省证明复收复打复查大有可为
    本报成都6日电　四川省千百万夏收大军人不卸甲、马不停蹄，在收完四千多万亩小春作物后，一鼓作气掀起了复收复打复查的突击运动。
    这次复收复打复查运动进行得很有成效。温江专区各公社经过复收复打，每亩小麦一般都多收十五斤左右；每亩油菜多收二十斤以上。内江专区现已收回小麦、豌豆、胡豆等小春粮食五百多万斤。内江、资中、乐至、威远等县还拣回去年没有收净留在田地里的红苕三百多万斤。
    为了割净、收净、打净、拣净，中共四川省委书记处书记阎秀峰和郫县县委检查组，在崇兴公社重打、重筛了一块已经打过、筛过的油菜“空秠”和“空荚”，结果在一亩地的“空秠”、“空荚”中，重新打下了三十四斤菜籽，加上从田里、地边扫来拣来的，总计共四十斤十一两。据各地典型调查，小麦每亩抛撒在十五斤左右；油菜每亩在十五斤至二十斤之间。这是一个惊人的数字。
    中共四川省委在5月下旬发出紧急指示，要求各地立即采取有效措施，把抛撒的粮食收回来。各级党委书记和农村干部亲自参加翻打，做出样子。内江、荣县、资中等县由上到下层层召开小春复打复收现场会，通过三查“查收地、查空秠、查打场”，清理抛撒情况，用生动具体的实例教育群众，使干部和社员认识抛撒浪费，对国家、公社和自己改善生活都有很大损害。于是，复收复打运动成了群众自觉的行动。
    在复打复收运动中，各地妥善安排了劳力，组织专业队伍，采取短期突击的方式进行。乐至县各公社在全面安排了夏收夏种劳力后，抽出了三万八千多个附带劳力和儿童，组成二千多个复收复打突击队，紧密配合收割，做到收一块、拣一块，打一道、清一道，一块一块过关，全县拣回二十五万多斤粮食。万县各公社抽调了五万二千多人，利用休息和空隙时间，见缝插针，开展为期三天到五天的小运动周，集中火力猛攻抛撒关，收回抛撒的粮食十四万二千五百多斤。此外，各地还建立了检查验收和评比奖励制度，对运动推动很大。
