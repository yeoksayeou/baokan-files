The Dominican Republic is one of the few remaining dictatorships in Latin America. Venezuela's Jiménez and Cuba's Batista, after their downfall, have both fled to the Dominican Republic.

    Located on the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean, bordering the Republic of Haiti, the Dominican Republic covers an area of over 48,000 square kilometers with a population of 2.7 million. The Dominican Republic is an agricultural country with strong colonial characteristics, producing sugar, cocoa, coffee, tobacco, and other products. Originally a Spanish colony, the Dominican Republic was later occupied by France and the previously independent Republic of Haiti. It only formally gained independence in the mid-19th century. In the early 20th century, the United States dispatched troops to the Dominican Republic several times and forcibly supported pro-American regimes.

    Since 1930, the Dominican Republic has been under the dictatorial rule of the Trujillo family, who were supported by the United States. During the US military occupation of the Dominican Republic in the early 20th century, the elder Trujillo served in the US Marine Corps, helping to suppress the Dominican people's anti-American guerrillas. After the US military withdrew, he became the head of the national police. In 1930, he came to power through a military coup and served as president for eighteen years. In 1952, he handed the presidency over to his brother; another brother served as Minister of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, while he proclaimed himself Grand Marshal, established the Marshal's Affairs Department, and effectively controlled military and political power.

    After coming to power, Trujillo inherited the American violent rule over the Dominican people, prohibiting the existence of any other political parties, with only his own Dominican Party being legal. By 1940, he simply renamed the Dominican Party as the Trujillo Party. The Dominican People's Socialist Party (Communist Party) has been driven underground since its establishment in 1946.

    In recent years, in view of the rising tide of national independence movements in Latin America and the increasing resistance of the domestic people, Trujillo has intensified his reign of terror, wantonly persecuting those who express dissatisfaction with his rule. In order to maintain his regime, Trujillo has also purchased a large number of aircraft from Britain, Canada, and other countries, and recruited 5,000 reservists and 1,000 "volunteers" into the army, and concluded a notorious "anti-communist treaty" with neighboring Haiti.

    In terms of foreign policy, the Trujillo government has always succumbed to the United States. Trujillo believes that if the United States builds more military bases in the Dominican Republic, it would be a support for his regime. Therefore, he desperately welcomes the stationing of US troops and guarantees his willingness to cooperate with the United States in any "defense" plan. In the period from January 16 to February 14 this year alone, more than 2,000 US Marine Corps infantrymen entered the ports of the Dominican Republic.

    In order to please his American masters, Trujillo does not hesitate to make the Dominican Republic a sugar-producing country under American plunder. Sugar factories are almost entirely owned by American capital. Two American companies control 80% of sugar production. The United States not only owns vast sugarcane fields, but also has its own seaports, railways, electricity, and telephone companies, etc. In 1943, out of the total industrial investment of US$77.94 million in the Dominican Republic, US capital accounted for US$61 million, or about 80%. In 1955, US direct investment in the Dominican Republic reached US$134 million. And half of the Dominican Republic's foreign trade relies on the United States.

    Trujillo is not only a tyrant, but also a major landlord and capitalist in the Dominican Republic. He personally owns a large amount of land. Through his brothers, sisters, and relatives, he controls all industries in the country except sugar, such as salt, matches, livestock, cattle, goat milk, butter, tobacco, and grain, etc. His wife monopolizes the hardware and laundry industries, etc.; in addition, they also own an insurance company and a shoe factory. Now the Trujillo family has developed into the largest monopoly capital group in the Dominican Republic. He himself has become one of the richest men in the Americas, with deposits of US$65 million in a New York bank alone, and his assets are estimated to be as high as US$1 billion.

    However, the people of the Dominican Republic under this dictatorship live in dire straits and unbearable hardship. Among the Dominican people, the struggle against dictatorship has developed rapidly in recent years. After the overthrow of the Jiménez regime in Venezuela and the Batista regime in Cuba, Trujillo's rule is even more precarious. At the beginning of this year, patriotic people in exile in Venezuela, Cuba, and other countries established anti-dictatorial political organizations. These political organizations jointly formed the "Dominican Liberation Union" in May, and issued a declaration on a minimum revolutionary program, calling on all democratic organizations to unite and struggle to overthrow the Trujillo dictatorship. The recent outbreak of armed struggle is clearly a further development of the Dominican people's anti-dictatorial struggle.

### 在独裁统治下的多米尼加

    在独裁统治下的多米尼加
    多米尼加是拉丁美洲现在仅存的几个独裁国家之一。委内瑞拉的希门尼斯和古巴的巴蒂斯塔垮台后，现在都逃亡在多米尼加。
    多米尼加位于加勒比海海地岛上，与海地共和国毗邻，面积四万八千多平方公里，人口二百七十万。多米尼加是一个带有浓厚殖民地性质的农业国，盛产糖、可可、咖啡、烟草等。多米尼加原为西班牙殖民地，以后曾一度被法国和先独立的海地共和国占领。十九世纪中叶才正式独立。二十世纪初美国几次出兵多米尼加，并强行扶植亲美政权。
    从1930年起，多米尼加一直处在美国一手扶植起来的特鲁希略家族的独裁统治下。二十世纪初美军占领多米尼加时，老特鲁希略在美海军陆战队中任职，帮助镇压多米尼加人民反美游击队。美军撤退后，他当了国家警察的头子。1930年通过军事政变上台，前后当了十八年总统。1952年，他把总统让给了他的弟弟；他的另一弟弟任海陆空军部长，他自封大元帅，设元帅事务部，实际操纵军政大权。
    特鲁希略上台后，继承了美国对多米尼加人民的暴力统治，禁止其他任何政党存在，只有他自己的多米尼加党是合法的。到1940年，他干脆将多米尼加党命名为特鲁希略党。多米尼加人民社会党（共产党）自1946年成立以来一直被打入地下。
    近年来，特鲁希略鉴于拉丁美洲民族独立运动高涨和国内人民反抗力量日益增强，加紧进行恐怖统治，肆意迫害对他的统治表示不满的人。为了保持他的政权，特鲁希略还从英、加等国购买了大批飞机，并征召五千名后备军和一千名“志愿军”入伍，同邻国海地订立了一个声名狼借的“反共条约”。
    在外交政策方面，特鲁希略政府一向屈从美国。特鲁希略认为，如果美国在多米尼加多建几个军事基地，那就是对他的政权的支持，因此他竭力欢迎美军驻扎，并保证愿为任何“防御”计划而和美国合作。仅在今年1月16日到2月14日这一段期间，就曾有二千多名美国海军陆战队步兵开进了多米尼加港口。
    为了讨好美国主子，特鲁希略不惜使多米尼加成为美国掠夺下的产糖国家。制糖厂几乎全为美资所有。两家美国公司控制了糖产量的80％。美国不仅拥有广大的蔗田，并有它自己的海港、铁路、电灯、电话公司等。在1943年，多米尼加的全部工业投资七千七百九十四万美元中，美国资本就占了六千一百万美元，约为80％。1955年，美国在多米尼加的直接投资达一亿三千四百万美元。而多米尼加的对外贸易也有一半是靠美国的。
    特鲁希略不但是一个暴君，而且是多米尼加的一个大地主和资本家。他个人占有大量土地。他并通过他的兄弟姊妹和亲戚掌握了除糖以外的全国各行业，如食盐、火柴、牲畜、牛、羊奶、牛油、烟草、粮食等，他的老婆垄断了五金业和洗衣业等；此外他们还拥有一家保险公司和一家鞋厂。现在特鲁希略家族已发展成为多米尼加最大的垄断资本集团。他本人已成为美洲最大的富翁之一，他在纽约一家银行里的存款就达六千五百万美元，据估计他的财产有十亿美元之多。
    然而在这独裁统治下的多米尼加人民，却生活在水深火热之中，困苦不堪。在多米尼加人民中，反独裁的斗争近年有迅速的发展。在委内瑞拉的希门尼斯和古巴的巴蒂斯塔政权被推翻后，特鲁希略的统治就更处于风雨飘摇之中。今年年初，流亡在委内瑞拉和古巴等国的爱国人士纷纷成立了反独裁的政治组织。这些政治组织5月间联合组成了“多米尼加解放联盟”，发表了一项关于最低革命纲领的声明，号召一切民主组织团结斗争，推翻特鲁希略独裁统治。最近爆发的武装斗争，显然是多米尼加人民反独裁斗争的进一步发展。　（美）
