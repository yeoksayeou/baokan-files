Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 27th - Grain departments in Hubei Province have put forward the slogan "Receive Grain Well, Manage Grain Well." While receiving and storing requisitioned grain, they have universally strengthened grain storage work.

Even before the summer harvest, grain departments in Hubei Province actively cleaned and repaired warehouses, exterminated rats and insects, disinfected with chemicals, and leveled grain drying yards. The Provincial Grain Bureau held a warehousing and inspection meeting to specifically study and arrange the storage work after this year's summer grain is put into storage.

After the summer harvest began, grain departments sent cadres to communes and production teams to help members harvest, thresh, and dry grain, and to inspect the quality of grain about to be put into storage. Xiangyang Special District, which is rich in wheat, currently has more than 330 grain keepers, carrying instruments and medicines for inspecting grain quality and preventing insect pests, inspecting storage work and the quality of grain in storage throughout the district. The Xiaogan Special District Grain Bureau recently also organized many groups to inspect grain storage work in various counties of the special district. Acquisition stations and warehouses in various parts of this special district have generally assigned a group of people to be specifically responsible for grain storage.

In organizing the storage of summer grain, grain departments in various places have found that some grain has a high moisture content and is not very clean, and they have dried and winnowed it in a timely manner. For miscellaneous grains such as broad beans and peas that are prone to insect pests, they have also taken measures such as sun-drying, fumigation, and airtight sealing to kill larvae. At the same time, all localities have strengthened fire prevention and other security work for grain in storage.

    修整仓库　检查质量
    湖北加强粮食保管工作
    新华社武汉27日电　湖北省各地粮食部门提出“收好粮、管好粮”的口号，在接收征购粮入库的同时，普遍加强了粮食保管工作。
    还在夏收以前，湖北省各地粮食部门就积极打扫修整仓库，灭鼠除虫，用药剂消毒，平整晒粮场地。省粮食厅召开了仓储检验会议，专门研究和安排了今年夏粮入库后的保管工作。
    在夏收开始以后，粮食部门派出干部到公社和生产队，一面帮助社员收打、翻晒粮食，一面检查即将入库的粮食质量。盛产小麦的襄阳专区，目前共有三百三十多个粮食保管员，带着检验粮质和防治虫害的仪器药械，在全区各地检查保管工作和入库粮食的质量。孝感专区粮食局最近也组织许多小组，到专区各县巡回检查粮食保管工作。这个专区各地的收购站和仓库，普遍分出一批人力专门负责保管粮食。
    各地粮食部门在组织夏粮入库中，发现一些含水量较多和不大干净的粮食，都及时地翻晒，扬净。对蚕豆豌豆等容易发生虫害的杂粮，还分别采取曝晒、熏蒸和密闭等办法杀灭幼虫。同时，各地都加强了入库粮食的防火等保卫工作。
