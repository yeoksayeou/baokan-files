Shenyang, June 5th (this newspaper) – Under the unified leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the commercial departments and urban people's communes of Shenyang City have been actively organizing the people's economic life since the beginning of this year.

To date, the service projects launched in various districts of Shenyang include laundry and mending clothes and socks, washing and dismantling bedding, dyeing, hairdressing, bathhouses, shoe repair, radio repair, repairing tables, chairs and benches, metal furniture, replacing glass, repairing kangs (heated platforms), repairing stoves, home beautification, short-distance transportation, and more than twenty other items. Incomplete statistics from the three districts of Shenhe, Tiexi, and Heping alone show that 983 various service points have been developed, with each street having at least one comprehensive service station specifically serving the economic life of residents. More than 5,830 people are participating.

In order to better meet the needs of the people's economic life, commercial departments have overcome numerous difficulties and tried every possible means to expand the source of goods from all aspects. In addition to helping the suburbs arrange production and signing sales contracts to ensure vegetable production, they have also vigorously organized the production of light industrial products and small commodities in conjunction with the consolidation of the people-run industry. The production of daily miscellaneous goods organized in Dadong District alone has 182 varieties. After rectification, the people-run factories in Shenhe District serving the people's life have increased by 9.3% compared to the past, and 121 kinds of small commodity production have been arranged. In addition, the people-run factories serving industrial production also produce some daily necessities or engage in repair services where possible.

Shenyang City is organizing people's economic life from two aspects. On the one hand, state-owned and joint state-private commercial, catering, and service industries are reasonably adjusting and expanding their commercial networks and increasing service projects according to the needs of the people. On the other hand, street residents are organizing a large number of mass-based people's economic life service stations. In Shenhe District, 312 various life service stations organized by the residents' masses have 2,200 service personnel, using the power of the masses to solve their own life problems.

This service team is organized under the leadership of state-owned commerce, starting from the convenience of the masses and adhering to the principle of combining centralization and decentralization. Some industries suitable for centralization, such as radio and bicycle repair, have adopted the form of fixed business outlets, scattered throughout the streets and alleys. The majority of the remaining industries have adopted the form of mobile life service teams, going from street to street and serving door-to-door. A number of family handicraft-style family service points have also been organized, such as family laundries and family knitting, extensively tapping the potential of social labor.

The widespread development of life service businesses has brought many conveniences to the people's economic life. The Central Road Service Station has developed a method of appointment service. If someone's appliance breaks down and needs repair, they can register with the residents' group leader, and someone will come to repair it. Dadong, Shenhe, and other districts have also established special household labor service teams. The masses not only do not have to worry about washing clothes, mending socks, and repairing furniture, but also have someone to take care of them when there is no one at home to take care of pregnant women, patients, chop firewood, and make coal briquettes. Dadong District also has voluntary guides. If a foreigner comes to Shenyang City and is unfamiliar with the road, they can go to the service station and someone will take you to where you want to go.

Currently, commercial departments are organizing employees and cadres to learn from the experience of Chongqing City, and various districts are also formulating comprehensive plans, preparing to further launch a mass movement to continue to study and solve some urgent problems, so as to make the work of organizing people's economic life better and more comprehensive.

    沈阳积极组织人民经济生活
    营业网撒开
    服务队上门
    本报沈阳5日电沈阳市商业部门和市区人民公社，在中共沈阳市委统一领导下，从今年年初起，积极组织人民经济生活。
    到目前为止，沈阳市各区已经举办的服务项目，有浆洗和修补衣服袜子、拆洗被褥、洗染、理发、浴池、修鞋、修理无线电、修理桌椅板凳、金属家具、上玻璃、修炕、修理炉灶、美化家庭、短途运输等二十多项。仅据沈河、铁西、和平三个区的不完全统计，已经发展起来的各种服务点达九百八十三个，每一条街最少有一个专门为居民经济生活服务的综合服务站。参加的人员达五千八百三十多人。
    为了更好地满足人民经济生活的需要，商业部门克服了重重困难，千方百计从各方面扩大了商品来源。除了帮助郊区安排生产，签订产销合同，使蔬菜生产落实外，并结合整顿民办工业，大力组织了轻工业品和小商品的生产。大东区组织起来的日用杂品生产即有一百八十二种。沈河区的民办工业经过整顿后，为人民生活服务的工厂比过去增加9.3％，已安排的小商品生产达一百二十一种。此外，为工业生产服务的民办工厂，在可能的条件下，也生产一部分日用品或兼营修理业务。
    沈阳市从两方面着手组织人民经济生活。一方面是国营和公私合营商业、饮食业、服务业，根据人民需要，合理地调整和扩大了商业网，增加了服务项目。另一方面则由街道居民组织起大量的群众性的人民经济生活服务站。沈河区由居民群众组织起来的各种生活服务站三百十二个，有二千二百多名服务人员，用群众的力量解决群众自己的生活问题。
    这批服务队伍，是在国营商业的领导下，从方便居民群众出发，本着集中与分散相结合的原则组织起来的。一部分适于集中的行业如无线电、自行车修理等，则采取了固定营业点的形式，星罗棋布在各个街道里巷中。其余大部分行业是采取了生活服务队的形式游街串巷，服务上门。还组织了一批家庭手工业式的家庭服务点。如家庭洗衣房，家庭织毛衣等，广泛挖掘了社会劳动力的潜力。
    广泛开展生活服务业务，给人民经济生活带来了许多方便。中央路服务站开展了一种预约服务的方法，谁家的某种用具坏了需要修理时，到居民组长那里挂个号，就有人去修理了。大东、沈河等区还专门建立了家务劳动服务队，群众不仅对洗衣服，补袜子，修理家具等事不用发愁，就是连照顾产妇、病人、劈烧柴、打煤坯等，如果家里确实无人的，也有人代为操劳。大东区还有义务响导，外地人到沈阳市路不熟，到服务站一说，就有人送你到你所要去的地方去。
    目前，商业部门正组织职工和干部学习重庆市的经验，各区也在制订全面规划，准备进一步发起一个群众运动，继续研究解决一些急待解决的问题，从而使组织人民经济生活的工作作得更好更全面。（附图片）
