The central government has repeatedly instructed that we should strengthen leadership and launch a mass movement to improve the production and supply of non-staple foods. Practice has proven that the central government's instructions are correct. As long as we vigorously mobilize the masses, tap the potential of all aspects, make comprehensive arrangements for agricultural production, take all factors into consideration, and provide serious leadership, the production of non-staple foods can achieve even greater leaps forward.

Production and life are two legs; good living arrangements are conducive to the development of production, and living arrangements must be based on the development of production. Life, from the aspect of eating, has two parts: staple and non-staple foods. In recent years, due to the continuous development of production and the increasing improvement of people's living standards, the position of non-staple foods in people's lives has also increased, and it can be affirmed that it will continue to increase in the future. This is an inevitable trend of development. Vegetables, live pigs, and small poultry are the main non-staple foods. After making efforts, the people of Chongqing have now achieved complete self-sufficiency in vegetables. Live pigs will be self-sufficient by October, and the production of small poultry can basically meet market demands by next year. This is a great leap forward. An important experience gained from practical work in achieving this achievement is: under the unified leadership of the Party, vigorously promoting agricultural-commercial collaboration, implementing the "walking on two legs" policy, and launching a mass movement. Now, I will describe the situation in this regard.

Suburban areas prioritize vegetable production.

Chongqing (including three counties) now has a population of 4.4 million, with a ratio of urban to rural population of one to one. The city has a total cultivated area of 3.74 million mu, with good natural conditions, a long frost-free period, and abundant rainfall, suitable for the growth and reproduction of crops and poultry and livestock.

Based on the principle of suburban agricultural production serving the city, we have actively developed the production of non-staple foods, especially vegetable production, since 1953. In 1956, we also proposed the establishment of vegetable bases. However, at that time, the agricultural population was only more than 300,000, and the cultivated area was not large. The production of non-staple foods mainly relied on the support of surrounding special counties, and only partial self-sufficiency could be achieved. Vegetables supplied from other places accounted for about 70% of the supply, live pigs accounted for 80%, and small poultry accounted for 90%. After 1957, due to new changes in the relationship between urban and rural areas, the amount of non-staple foods supported by neighboring areas to the city decreased, which increased the pressure on market supply, making us feel that the city's supply must take the road of relying mainly on suburban production for self-sufficiency and supplemented by support from other places. Especially since the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, the number of urban workers has greatly increased, and the people's consumption level has also greatly improved, which has made us deeply realize the importance of implementing this policy.

Can the city's non-staple food production rely on suburban production to achieve self-sufficiency? Our answer is affirmative.

This is because: suburban areas have always had the habit and foundation of diversified operations, and also have sufficient cultivated land and manpower. Since Chongqing expanded three counties last year, the conditions have become more favorable; suburban areas can also easily get support from the city; after the communization last year, the masses' enthusiasm for production is also higher. Therefore, under these conditions, as long as we seriously grasp it, the development speed of non-staple food production will be very fast. In March 1958, the Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting on vegetable production and sales, determined to grasp it hard, and sure enough, in less than half a year, the vegetable supply situation fundamentally changed, from mainly relying on foreign aid to basically self-sufficiency. After a serious organization and mobilization of the masses, the vegetable planting area doubled, and thousands of people actively invested in building water conservancy projects, improving soil, and transporting and accumulating fertilizer, resulting in forty advanced units and high-yield banners. The total vegetable output of the city not only greatly increased, but the average yield per mu throughout the year also increased by 1.1 times compared with 1957. By the end of last year, the average person could eat more than one catty of fresh vegetables per day. At the same time, live pigs and small poultry also developed rapidly. In order to strive for a multiple increase in production, the masses developed a large number of pig farms and chicken farms. They would rather not eat meat or eggs, and left seeds everywhere; in order to solve the feed problem, the old and young cut grass and stored green feed together, and many high-yield red flags appeared. Outstanding examples include the Wulidian Pig Farm of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Commune in Jiangbei, which raised 1,250 pigs, with the average weight of fattened pigs being over 200 catties, and created a record of no pig deaths in three years; the Naxigou Brigade of Tushan Commune in Nanan District, with each household raising an average of more than 75 chickens. As of now, the city has developed 1.2 million live pigs (200,000 have been slaughtered, and 1 million are in stock), an increase of 18% compared with last year; the number of small poultry has developed to 4 million, an increase of 300% compared with last year.

The above is an overview of the development of vegetables, live pigs, and small poultry.

Don't worry about too many vegetables

Vigorously promoting agricultural-commercial collaboration can improve the production and supply of non-staple foods from both the production and sales links. The development process of vegetable production in Chongqing is a good illustration. Here, I will focus on the issue of implementing "multiple purchase and sales" in vegetable production and sales in Chongqing, which is an important aspect of reflecting agricultural-commercial collaboration.

The importance of vegetables in people's economic life is second only to grain. The primary link in ensuring the normal supply of non-staple foods is to ensure the supply of vegetables. Generally speaking, in people's lives, eating accounts for more than 50% of the cost, and vegetables account for 20% of the total eating expenditure. The masses not only require sufficient vegetables, but also require timely supply, which requires us to not only vigorously grasp production, but also correspondingly improve supply work and grasp both production and sales links.

In organizing vegetable production and supply, we have adopted the method of implementing "multiple purchase and sales" on the basis of planned production. Now it seems that this method is an effective way to expand vegetable production and ensure supply. Because vegetable production is highly technical, has many diseases and pests, and has large natural losses, there is a solution when there is too much, but there is a problem when there is too little. In the past, determining production based on sales and emphasizing the balance between production and sales could not achieve more production and could not dispel farmers' concerns about excessive vegetable prices; implementing the "multiple production and purchase" method can twist production and sales into one rope, fully guarantee supply on the basis of multiple production, and dispel farmers' concerns about multiple production on the basis of achieving purchase and sales. Promote agricultural and commercial departments to be jointly responsible for the market and better promote production development. However, the implementation of the "multiple purchase and sales" method went through a period of ideological struggle. The production department was worried that there would be too much planting, resulting in rotten vegetables and low prices, while the commercial department was afraid of losing money and that the quality and variety could not be guaranteed. This is a contradiction and a crux in the development of vegetable production in Chongqing. At the vegetable meeting held in March 1958, we organized a forum to discuss and debate this issue, calculated the economic accounts and political accounts, small accounts and big accounts. It was generally believed that the commercial department may lose some money by implementing the purchase and sales method, but in return it guaranteed the market supply and stabilized prices, which is beneficial politically. Therefore, this meeting not only solved ideological problems, but also organized agricultural-commercial collaboration on the basis of solving ideological problems, and solved some key problems in the vegetable sales link, becoming a joint leap forward meeting for agricultural and commercial departments.

1. Expanded vegetable bases and built new state-owned vegetable farms: In the establishment of bases, according to the situation of the seven districts at that time (the three counties had not yet been incorporated), the vegetable bases were expanded according to the average level of one catty of vegetables per person per day, and the professional team for planting vegetables was fixed, and land was reserved for planting. At the same time, social forces were also organized to grow vegetables. Now, some troops and schools have achieved self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency in vegetable growing.

2. Stipulated reasonable prices: The price of vegetables is related to the interests of the production department, sales department, and consumers. Reasonable prices can promote the implementation of multiple purchase and sales methods and are an important policy issue for promoting the development of vegetable production. The formulation of prices is based on the interests of production, supply, and consumption, but the interests of producers are considered first. In terms of price, the average purchase price of 16 major varieties was determined to be three cents per catty, and the retail price should not exceed five cents. In this way, production was developed and the market was stabilized. Although vegetable production was poor last year due to drought and flood, and the supply was once tight, the average retail price was always stable within five cents, and both producers and consumers were satisfied.

3. Strengthen market management and abolish the free vegetable market: Organize small vendors engaged in decentralized operations into collectively accounted cooperative stores, gradually ban unlicensed households, and reduce intermediate operating links.

4. Organize face-to-face production and consumption: Sign transaction contracts directly with collective catering units with conditions with people's communes in the suburbs to organize supply nearby. This is a feasible method to adapt to the planned nature of production and the large amount of centralized consumption in cities. At present, we have promoted this method in larger catering units, and both production and consumption parties have responded well.

In addition to solving the above specific problems, the fundamental problem in implementing the "multiple purchase and sales" method lies in strengthening leadership. And the main aspect of strengthening leadership is to strengthen the unified leadership of the Party Committee and strengthen agricultural-commercial collaboration. In the development of vegetable production, we have always encountered many difficulties, such as seeds, fertilizers, and water lifting equipment, which are very complicated. After the vegetable meeting, cadres from the agricultural and commercial departments formed a vegetable office to specifically organize production and organize supply work, and vigorously promoted agricultural-commercial collaboration. The agricultural department arranged production according to the supply plan proposed by the commercial department, and the commercial department sent resident staff to help production units solve fertilizer, seeds, and water lifting equipment, help introduce new varieties, and assist communes in building greenhouses. In this way, the problem was solved smoothly.

Due to the vigorous promotion of agricultural-commercial collaboration, production was promoted and market supply was guaranteed. In the off-season of vegetable production from April to May this year, we still ensured that the average person ate fifteen taels of fresh vegetables per day. There are currently twelve major varieties and ten small varieties on the market. Therefore, this is an important experience and must be adhered to in the future. At present, on the basis of vegetable self-sufficiency, the central requirement of agricultural-commercial collaboration is to strengthen the basic construction of vegetable bases and make suburban vegetable bases as soon as possible hydraulic, electrified, and mechanized. At the same time, we must strengthen transportation and storage, improve transportation tools; appropriately expand small varieties, and implement both coarse and fine varieties. In terms of management, we must implement the "six determinations," namely, determining leadership, determining land, determining labor, determining output, determining measures, and determining time to market. This work has been arranged at the city's multi-economic meeting held not long ago. The focus of the "six determinations" is to further arrange the labor force in the vegetable base.

Everyone raises pigs, everyone raises chickens

The policy of "walking on two legs" and vigorously launching mass movements have also powerfully proved that this is a correct policy in Chongqing's organization of non-staple food production. Here, I will mainly describe the development of live pig and small poultry production.

Live pigs and small poultry occupy a very important position in people's life consumption and have a large demand. In development, we resolutely implemented the central government's policy of "walking on two legs." On the one hand, we rely on people's communes to adopt various methods for breeding, and on the other hand, we mobilize urban people to do it together, raise them together, and vigorously launch mass movements in places with conditions.

For the development of live pigs, we have adopted a method of combining public ownership and public raising, public ownership and private raising, and private ownership and private raising. In terms of public ownership and public raising, one method is to rely on the canteens of people's commune production teams to run pig farms, and the other method is to rely on people's communes and management areas to run pig farms. In the division of labor between communes, management areas, and production teams, the main tasks of communes and management areas are to be responsible for raising sows and boars, and production teams are responsible for raising fattened pigs. In terms of public ownership and private raising, the main thing is to distribute piglets to commune members for private feeding. The feed relies on pig farmers to use open spaces in front of and behind their houses and barren slopes to grow feed crops to solve the problem. The insufficient part is supplemented by the production team. This is beneficial to solving pig raising equipment and tapping labor potential. In implementing public ownership and private raising, we implemented the principle of reasonable public and private income distribution and the reward system; private ownership and private raising are mainly implemented in remote mountainous areas where feed and fuel are relatively abundant.

Institutions, troops, schools, factories, mines, and enterprises located in the suburbs also raise pigs. Now they have developed to more than 30,000 heads. Some troops and a small number of institutions and factories have achieved self-sufficiency. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses to raise pigs, agricultural and commercial departments have provided assistance in feed, feeding technology, pig sources, and epidemic prevention. This year, they plan to help them raise 70,000 pigs. In addition, the catering, food and other units of the commercial sector currently raise nearly 10,000 live pigs (excluding 20,000 fattened pigs in transit), and plan to develop to 40,000 by the end of the year (excluding fattened pigs in transit). We believe that the institutions and commercial units in the suburbs are a supplementary force for the pig raising industry.

The development of small poultry implements the policy of private raising as the main factor and public raising as the auxiliary factor. In addition to mobilizing the masses to vigorously raise them in rural areas, some have also been raised in other aspects (collective units, residents, and commercial departments, etc.). For the development of small poultry, we have adopted the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, and vigorously carry out artificial incubation. Rural people's communes now have 92 hatcheries with an incubation capacity of 1.4 million chicks and ducks at a time. The birth rate is over 90%, and they have passed the "incubation barrier." Some experience has also been gained in chick rearing, and the "barrier" has basically been passed. Now the survival rate of chicks is over 60%.

The main problem currently existing in live pigs and small poultry is no longer the issue of reproduction speed, but rather the issue of feed. To solve the feed problem, we must also vigorously launch mass movements. In addition to allocating a portion of agricultural land for feed cultivation, the main thing is to adopt the method of green feed to widely open up feed sources. In this regard, the masses have created many methods:

(1) Use open spaces in front of and behind houses, barren hills, grave slopes, and forest land to grow feed, and adopt the method of combining feed planting with green manure and combining with canteen vegetable management to solve the problem of green feed.

(2) Vigorously restore and develop rural oil mills, sugar mills, distilleries, flour mills, and tofu workshops where grain is permitted. Use the by-products of the five workshops to solve the problem of refined feed.

(3) Make full use of agricultural and sideline products and run rural soil-based feed processing plants with water and animal power to process bran hulls, broad bean pods, and corn cobs into feed.

(4) In the peak season of green output, process and store large quantities for the needs of the off-season, especially autumn sweet potato vines (the sweet potato vines in the city this autumn can be enough for one-third of the green feed required by live pigs in the city throughout the year).

(5) In places with conditions, promote the simple pen combined with grazing feeding method, and adopt the method of feed going up the mountain and the pig herd going up the mountain to save feed, pig houses, and labor.

(6) Set out reward measures and carry out a movement for commune members to pull a handful of pigweed each during work, after work, and during work breaks, and organize students to pull wild pigweed during their spare time.

Due to the implementation of the policy of "walking on two legs" and vigorously launching mass movements, Chongqing has a reliable guarantee for completing the development plan of 1.7 million live pigs and 7.5 million small poultry this year. With the implementation of this plan, the existing supply can be further improved. However, this is still a relatively low supply level. It is by no means our goal. We are determined to continue to retain sufficient breeding livestock and poultry on the basis of this year's production, and lay a greater foundation for the development of live pigs and poultry next year.

Leadership must be strengthened

The central government has repeatedly instructed that we should strengthen leadership and launch a mass movement to improve the production and supply of non-staple foods. Practice has proven that the central government's instructions are correct. According to Chongqing's specific conditions, as long as we vigorously mobilize the masses, tap the potential of all aspects, and conduct comprehensive arrangements according to the guideline of taking grain, cotton, oil, vegetables, and meat as the key in agricultural production, take all factors into consideration, and earnestly strengthen leadership, the production of non-staple foods can achieve even greater leaps forward. This can not only achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables, live pigs, and small poultry, but also gradually achieve basic or partial self-sufficiency in non-staple foods such as fish, oil, and sugar. In order to continue to do a good job in the production and supply of non-staple foods, we must also strengthen agricultural-commercial collaboration and vigorously launch mass movements.

(1) Put politics in command and resolutely implement the central government's proposal that "suburban agricultural production should 'take vegetables as the key,' followed by doing a good job in the production of pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and feed." We must implement this policy among cadres and the masses, and make cadres and the masses understand the necessity and possibility of relying on suburban production of non-staple foods for self-sufficiency after the current economic situation changes, especially to make cadres realize the huge potential of suburban production, boost their energy, rely on the masses, and try every means to find tricks and add measures to make the production of non-staple foods have greater development.

(2) Strengthen leadership, grasp early, grasp hard, grasp tightly, and grasp comprehensively. In addition to the multiple economic office and the vegetable office grasping daily work, the municipal party committee plans to grasp four times this year. It has already grasped twice in the first half of the year, and will grasp once again recently, mainly to solve the vegetable production and supply problems that may occur during the autumn drought in August and September, as well as the feed and epidemic prevention problems that occur after the mass breeding of live pigs and small poultry.

(3) Take all factors into consideration, make comprehensive arrangements, conduct investigations on the economic situation in the suburbs, and propose development plans for various non-staple foods and cash crops. Set out a guideline for the development of suburban non-staple foods and cash crop production.

(4) Establish red flags, set up pacesetters, vigorously launch mass movements, and promote advanced experiences. In February this year, we convened a meeting of representatives of advanced agricultural production collectives and individuals in the city, conditionally promoted the feeding method of simple pens combined with grazing in live pig breeding, promoted the experience of mobilizing the masses to solve the pig feed problem with green feed as the mainstay, and promoted the experience of large-scale pig raising and rapid fattening. In vegetable production, we promoted the experience of arranging sowing, harvesting in stages, and evenly marketing, as well as the experience of large-scale high yields, all of which played a great role. At the same time, we learned from the advanced experience of other places. Last year, we sent several batches of people to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an, Wuhan, Chengdu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangzhou, Shandong, Henan, Zhejiang and other provinces (regions) and cities to learn from experience, and introduced 11 types and 172 varieties of new vegetables, increasing the city's vegetable varieties from 68 major categories to 79 types, and from 178 varieties to 350 varieties, which promoted the development of non-staple food production. In the future, we must adhere to learning from the experience of other places and promote it in combination with the specific conditions of Chongqing.

While continuing to develop grain, we must correspondingly develop non-staple food production. This is the requirement of the people, and it is also a guideline for the Party to guide agricultural production. Experience has proven that the development of non-staple foods is a matter of determination and a matter of method. Of course, it is not without difficulties to develop non-staple foods at a high speed from a relatively poor foundation, and some new problems will also appear with the development of production. However, as long as we have great determination, earnestly implement the Party's policies, the methods are correct, and fully rely on the masses, all difficulties can be overcome. Under the new historical conditions, the broad masses of the people are not only the builders of socialism, but also the masters of the country, and have a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity for socialist construction and development of production. Chongqing is an industrial city in Sichuan Province. After the Party's education, the farmers in the suburbs clearly know that developing production and ensuring the supply of non-staple foods is a glorious responsibility to support industrial production. Although the current non-staple food production has developed more than in the past, the people's demands are also constantly increasing, and this responsibility will continue to increase day by day. We must continue to boost our energy under the shining light of the Party's general line, and in the spirit of comprehensive arrangement and comprehensive planning for suburban production, and do a better job in the production, supply and sales of non-staple foods, so that it is possible to fully meet the needs of the people and make people live more happily.

    农商协作把副食品的产销搞得更好
    中共重庆市委书记处书记　辛易之
    中央历次指示，对副食品的生产和供应，要加强领导和大搞群众运动。实践证明中央的指示是正确的。只要我们大力发动群众，挖掘各方面的潜力，在农业生产上全面安排，统筹兼顾，认真领导，副食品的生产就可以更大地跃进。
    生产和生活是两条腿，生活安排好了就有利于生产的发展，而生活又必须在生产发展的基础上进行安排。生活，从吃的方面讲，有主、副食品两个部分。几年来，由于生产的不断发展，人民生活水平的日益提高，副食品在人们生活中所占的地位也提高了，可以肯定，今后还会继续提高。这是一个发展的必然趋势。蔬菜、生猪、小家禽是主要的副食品，重庆市的人民群众经过一番努力，现在蔬菜已做到了全部自给了，生猪到十月即可自给，小家禽生产到明年也可以基本上满足市场要求。这是一个大跃进。这一成绩的取得，从实际工作中体会到的一条重要经验就是：在党的统一领导下，大搞农商协作，贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，大搞群众运动。现就这方面的情况作一述叙。
    郊区生产蔬菜第一
    重庆市（包括三个县）现有人口四百四十万，城市同农村人口的比例为一比一。全市共有耕地面积三百七十四万亩，自然条件较好，无霜期长，雨量充沛，宜于农作物和家禽家畜的生长繁殖。
    根据郊区农业生产为城市服务的方针，我们从1953年开始，积极发展了副食品生产，特别是蔬菜生产。1956年并提出了建立蔬菜基地。但是，当时农业人口仅有三十多万，耕地面积不多，副食品生产主要是依靠周围各专县支援，只能做到部分自给，外地供应的蔬菜要占到供应量的百分之七十左右，生猪为百分之八十，小家禽为百分之九十。1957年以后，由于城乡关系发生了新的变化，邻区支援城市的副食品数量减少，加重了市场供应的压力，使我们感到城市供应必须走依靠郊区生产自给为主，外地支援为辅的道路。特别是1958年工农业生产大跃进以来，城市职工人数大大增加，人民消费水平也大大提高了，更使我们深刻地体会到贯彻执行这一方针的重要性。
    城市副食品生产，能否依靠郊区生产做到自给呢？我们的答复是肯定的。
    这是因为：郊区一向有多种经营的习惯和基础，也有足够的耕地和人力，重庆市自去年扩大三个县以后，条件就更为有利；郊区也容易得到城市的支援；去年公社化后，群众的生产积极性也更高了。因此，在这种条件下，只要认真地抓起来，副食品生产的发展速度会是很快的。1958年三月份，市委召开了蔬菜产销工作会议，下决心狠狠地抓一下，果然不到半年，蔬菜就根本改变了供应情况，从主要依靠外援，改变成为基本自给。经认真组织发动群众后，蔬菜播种面积便成倍增加，成千上万的人都积极投入了大办水利、改良土壤、运肥积肥中去，出现了四十个先进单位和高产旗帜，全市蔬菜总产量不仅大大增加，而且全年平均亩产也较1957年增加一点一倍，到去年年底平均每人每日已能吃到鲜菜一斤以上。与此同时，生猪同小家禽也有了较快的发展。群众为了争取生产成倍增长，发展了大量的养猪场、养鸡场，他们宁肯不吃肉、不吃蛋，到处留种；为了解决饲料问题，老幼一齐割草贮青，出现了不少的高产红旗。突出的如江北中苏友好公社五里店养猪场曾养猪一千二百五十头，出槽肥猪均在二百斤以上，并创造了三年不死猪的记录；南岸区涂山公社纳溪沟大队，每户平均养鸡在七十五只以上。截至目前为止，全市生猪已发展到了一百二十万头（已出栏二十万头，在栏猪为一百万头），较去年增加了百分之十八；小家禽已发展到四百万只，较去年增加了百分之三百。
    以上是蔬菜、生猪和小家禽发展的概况。
    蔬菜不怕多
    大搞农商协作，能够从产销两个环节上作好副食品生产和供应工作，重庆市蔬菜生产的发展过程就是一个很好的说明。在这里，着重谈谈重庆在蔬菜生产、销售上实行“多种包销”的问题，这是体现农商协作的一个重要方面。
    蔬菜在人民经济生活中的重要性仅次于粮食，保证副食品的正常供应，首要的环节是保证蔬菜的供应。一般说来，在人民生活中，吃的一项要占费用开支的50％以上，菜又占了吃的支出总数的20％。群众不仅要求菜的数量够吃，而且还要求供应及时，这就要求我们除了大抓生产以外，还要相应地搞好供应工作，把生产和销售环节都抓起来。
    我们在组织蔬菜的生产和供应上，是采取了在计划生产的基础上实行“多种包销”的办法。现在看来，这个办法是扩大蔬菜生产和保证供应的有效办法。因为蔬菜生产技术性强，病虫害多，自然损耗大，多了才有办法，少了就成问题。以往以销定产和强调产销平衡是不可能实现多产，不可能解除农民菜多滥价的顾虑的；实行“多产包销”的办法就能够把生产和销售拧成一股绳，在多种多产的基础上充分地保证供应，在实现包销的基础上解除农民多产的顾虑。促使农业部门和商业部门共同为市场负责，更好地促进生产发展。但是，实现“多种包销”的办法是经过一番思想斗争的。生产部门的顾虑是怕多种了，滥菜滥价，商业部门则怕赔钱，品种质量不能保证。这是一个矛盾，是重庆市蔬菜生产发展上的一个症结所在。在1958年3月召开的蔬菜会议上，我们曾就这一问题组织了鸣放，争辩，算了经济账，也算了政治账，算了小账，也算了大账。一致认为实行包销办法，商业部门有时可能赔些钱，但换来的却是保证了市场供应和稳定了物价，在政治上是有利的。因此，这次会议不仅解决了思想问题，并且在解决思想问题的基础上，也组织了农商协作，解决了蔬菜销售环节上的一些关键问题，而成为农商部门的共同跃进会。
    一、扩大了蔬菜基地，新建了国营蔬菜农场：在基地建立上，根据当时七个区的情况（当时三个县尚未划入），按照每人每天平均吃一斤菜的水平扩大了蔬菜基地并固定了种植蔬菜的专业队伍和留出种地。与此同时，还组织了社会力量种菜。现在，已有一部分驻军和学校种菜达到自给或部分自给。
    二、规定了合理的价格：蔬菜的价格是关系着生产部门、销售部门和消费者三方面的利益问题，价格合理才能促进多种包销办法的实现，是促进蔬菜生产发展的重要政策问题。对价格的制订，我们是根据产、供、消三方面的利益考虑的，但首先考虑的是生产者的利益。在价格上，确定了十六个大品种的平均每斤收购价为三分，零售价不超过五分，这样做，发展了生产，稳定了市场。去年虽然因旱涝关系蔬菜歉收，供应一度紧张，但平均零售的价格始终稳定在五分以内，生产者、消费者都是满意的。
    三、加强市场管理，取消蔬菜自由市场：把分散经营的小商贩组织成为统一核算的合作商店，逐步取缔无照户，减少中间经营环节。
    四、组织产消见面：把有条件的集体伙食单位直接与市郊人民公社签订交易合同，就近组织供应。这是适应生产计划性和城市集中消费量大的特点的一种可行的办法，目前我们在较大的伙食单位推广了这种办法，产、消双方反映都好。
    实现“多种包销”的办法除解决以上具体问题外，根本问题还在于加强领导。而加强领导的主要方面，则是加强党委的统一领导和加强农商协作。在发展蔬菜生产上，我们遇到的困难一直是很多的，例如种子、肥料、提水设备等，都很复杂。蔬菜会议以后，由农业和商业部门派出干部组成了蔬菜办公室，具体组织生产和组织供应工作，大搞农商协作。农业部门根据商业部门提出的供应计划安排生产，商业部门则派出驻社人员，帮助生产单位解决肥料、种子、提水设备，帮助引进新品种和协助公社建立温室。这样，才顺利地解决了问题。
    由于大搞了农商协作，也就促进了生产，保证了市场供应。在今年4至5月蔬菜生产的淡季里，我们仍然保证了每人每日平均吃到鲜菜十五两。目前上市的大宗品种有十二个，小品种有十个。因此，这是一项重要经验，今后还必须继续坚持。当前，在蔬菜已经自给的基础上，农商协作的中心要求，是要加强蔬菜基地的基本建设，使郊区蔬菜基地尽快的水利化、电气化、机械化。同时，要加强运输保管工作，改良交通运输工具；适当扩大小品种，实行粗细品种并举。在管理方面，要推行“六定”，即定领导，定地块，定劳动力，定产量，定措施，定上市时间。这一工作在不久以前召开的市的多种经济会议上已作了布置。“六定”的重点是要进一步安排好蔬菜基地的劳动力。
    大家养猪大家养鸡
    “两条腿走路”的方针，大搞群众运动，在重庆市组织副食品生产上，也有力地证明了这是一条正确的方针。这里，我主要叙述生猪、小家禽生产的发展情况。
    生猪、小家禽在人们生活消费中，占有很重要的位置，需要量大，我们在发展上是坚决贯彻了中央关于“两条腿走路”的方针，一方面依靠人民公社采取多种多样的方式饲养，另一方面则发动城市人民，在有条件的地方大家干，大家养，大搞群众运动。
    对发展生猪，我们采取了公有公养，公有私养，私有私养三种形式相结合的办法。在公有公养方面，一种方式是依靠人民公社生产队的食堂办养猪场，一种方式是依靠人民公社和管理区办养猪场。在公社、管理区和生产队的分工上，公社和管理区的主要任务是负责饲养母猪同种猪，生产队育养肥猪。在公有私养方面，主要是把小猪分散给社员私人喂养，饲料依靠养猪户利用屋前屋后空地，荒坡种植饲料作物解决，不足部分由生产队补给。这对于解决养猪设备和挖掘劳动潜力都有好处。实行公有私养，我们贯彻了合理的公私收益分配原则和奖励制度；私有私养，主要是在边远山区，饲料、燃料比较充裕的地方实行。
    住在郊区的机关、驻军、学校、厂矿、企业等单位也养了猪，现在已发展到三万余头，部分驻军和少数机关、工厂已达到了自给。为了鼓励群众养猪的积极性，农商部门在饲料、饲养技术、猪源、防疫等问题上进行了帮助，今年准备帮助他们养猪七万头。此外，商业部门的饮食、食品等单位目前也养了生猪近一万头（养的过路肥猪二万头未计算在内），年底准备发展到四万头（不包括过路肥猪）。我们认为，郊区的机关团体和商业单位是养猪事业的一支补充力量。
    小家禽的发展贯彻执行了以私养为主，公养为辅的方针，除了在农村发动群众大力饲养外，在其他方面（集体单位、居民和商业部门等）也养了一部分。对于小家禽的发展，我们采取了土洋并举，以土为主的办法，大搞人工孵化。农村人民公社现已有九十二个孵化房，孵化能力一次可达到一百四十万只小鸡、鸭，出生率在90％以上，均已过了“孵化关”。育雏工作也取得了一些经验，基本上过了“关”，现在鸡雏成活率在60％以上。
    生猪同小家禽当前存在的主要问题，已不是繁殖的速度问题，而是集中到饲料问题上来了。解决饲料问题，也必须大搞群众运动，除了在农业耕地中划出一部分种植饲料外，更主要是采取以青料为主的办法来广泛开辟饲料来源。对此，群众已经创造了许多办法：
    （1）利用屋前屋后、荒山、坟坡、林地种植饲料，并采取饲料种植与绿肥相结合，与食堂蔬菜经营相结合的办法解决青饲料问题。
    （2）在粮食许可情况下大力恢复和发展农村的油坊、糖坊、槽坊、粉坊和豆腐坊。用五坊生产的副产品解决精饲料问题。
    （3）充分利用农副产品，大办水力、畜力的饲料土法加工场，加工糠壳、胡豆荚、包谷心等作饲料。
    （4）在出青旺季，大量加工窖贮，以供淡季需要，特别是秋季红苕藤（今秋全市红苕藤可够全市生猪全年所需青饲料的三分之一）。
    （5）有条件的地方，推行简易通栏结合放牧的饲养方法，采取饲料地上山，猪群上山，以节约饲料、猪舍和劳动力。
    （6）定出奖励办法，开展社员利用上工、下坡、工间休息时间每人扯一把猪草的运动，并组织学生在课余时间扯野生猪草。
    由于贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，大搞群众运动，重庆今年完成一百七十万头生猪和七百五十万只小家禽的发展计划已经有了可靠保证了。实现了这个计划，就可以在现有的供应基础上再提高一步。但是，这仍是较低的供应水平。绝不是我们的奋斗目标。我们决心在今年的生产基础上，继续留足种畜、种禽，为明年生猪家禽的发展打下更大的基础。
    必须加强领导
    中央历次指示，对副食品的生产和供应，要加强领导和大搞群众运动。实践证明中央的指示是正确的。根据重庆的具体条件，只要我们大力发动群众，挖掘各方面的潜力，在农业生产上根据粮、棉、油、菜、肉为纲，进行全面安排，统筹兼顾的方针，认真加强领导，副食品的生产还可以更大地跃进。这不仅可以作到蔬菜、生猪、小家禽自给，而且还可以逐步作到鱼、油、糖等副食品基本自给或部分自给。为了继续搞好副食品生产和供应工作，我们还必须加强农商协作，大搞群众运动。
    （一）政治挂帅，坚决贯彻中央提出的“近郊区农业生产‘以菜为纲’，其次是搞好猪、鸡、鸭、鹅和饲料的生产”。要把这个方针贯彻到干部和群众中去，要使干部同群众，都要明了当前经济形势变化以后，依靠郊区生产副食品自给的必要性和可能性，特别要使干部认识郊区生产的巨大潜力，鼓足干劲，依靠群众，千方百计地找窍门，添措施，使副食品生产有更大地发展。
    （二）加强领导，抓早，抓狠，抓紧，抓全面。除多种经济办公室和蔬菜办公室要抓紧日常工作外，市委计划今年要大抓四次，上半年已经抓了两次，最近还要抓一次，主要是解决8、9月份可能发生秋旱时的蔬菜生产和供应问题，以及生猪、小家禽在大量繁殖后而发生的饲料问题同防疫问题。
    （三）统筹兼顾，全面安排，对郊区的经济情况进行调查，提出各项副食品和经济作物的发展规划。订出发展郊区副食品和经济作物生产的纲要。
    （四）树红旗，立标兵，大搞群众运动，推广先进经验。今年2月间我们召开了全市农业先进生产集体和个人的代表会议，在生猪饲养上有条件地推广了简易通栏和放牧相结合的饲养方法，推广了发动群众以青饲料为主解决猪饲料问题的经验和大群养猪、快速催肥的经验。在蔬菜生产上推广了排开播种，分期收获，均衡上市的经验和大面积高产的经验，都起了很大的作用。同时，学习了外地的先进经验。去年我们曾分批派出若干人，到北京、上海、天津、西安、武汉、成都、广西、贵州、广州、山东、河南、浙江等省（区）、市学习经验，并引进了蔬菜新品种十一个种类、一百七十二个品种，使全市菜的品种由六十八个大类增到七十九个种类，由一百七十八个品种增到三百五十个品种，促进了副食品生产的发展。今后要坚持学习外地的经验，结合重庆的具体情况加以推广。
    在继续发展粮食的同时，必须相应地发展副食品生产，这是人民群众的要求，也是党指导农业生产的一条方针。经验证明，副食品的发展，一是决心问题，一是方法问题。当然，副食品从生产较差的基础上要高速度的发展，并不是没有困难的，随着生产的发展也还会出现若干新的问题。但是，只要我们决心大，认真贯彻党的政策，方法对头，充分依靠群众，所有困难都是能够克服的。在新的历史条件下，广大人民群众不仅是社会主义的建设者，也是国家的主人，对社会主义建设和发展生产有着高度的积极性和创造性。重庆市是四川省的一个工业城市，郊区农民经过党的教育，清楚地知道发展生产，保证副食品供应是支援工业生产的一项光荣职责。当前副食品生产虽然比过去有了较大的发展，但人民的要求也是在不断提高的，这种责任仍然会日益加重，我们必须在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，本着郊区生产统筹兼顾，全面安排的精神，继续鼓足干劲，把副食品的产供销工作搞得更好，才有可能充分满足人民群众的要求，使人民生活得更加愉快。
