    The Universally Praised Peace Hotel

    Xinhua News Agency Reporter

    Travelers who have stayed at the Peace Hotel in Laifeng County, western Hubei Province, will enthusiastically talk about the many touching deeds of the hotel's staff in caring for and providing attentive service to the guests whenever the Peace Hotel is mentioned.

    As soon as the bus enters the bus station in Laifeng County, travelers will notice the smiling staff of the Peace Hotel's service desk welcoming them. They have already prepared hot water, washing water, and toiletries for the travelers, allowing them to wash their faces, rinse their mouths, and brush off the dust from their bodies as soon as they get off the bus. If they see that some travelers are feeling unwell due to the bumpy journey, the staff will prepare cots and medicines such as Rendan and cooling balm, allowing the travelers to rest and recuperate. If travelers need accommodation, the staff will compete to carry luggage, hold children, and help the elderly, enthusiastically guiding them to the hotel.

    The Peace Hotel may seem like just a few simple tile-roofed houses, but thanks to the diligent decoration and cleaning by the staff, the interior and exterior appear exceptionally clean and bright. There are particularly comfortable rooms dedicated to elderly travelers, as well as mother-and-child rooms for mothers with children. As soon as a traveler enters, the staff will meticulously inquire about their comfort and help them with the trivialities of life during their journey. For example, if clothes or trousers are torn, the female staff will quickly mend them. If travelers need to remit money, send letters, or buy bus or theater tickets, the staff will promptly take care of it. The staff have also set up an entertainment room in the hotel, equipped with books, chess, ping-pong, and record players, allowing travelers to read, play, and eliminate the leisure and fatigue of their journey.

    What is even more unforgettable for travelers is that when they encounter unexpected difficulties, the staff will show meticulous care and help them overcome them. Zhong Daode, a purchasing agent from the Shashi Thermos Factory, once fell ill in Laifeng County on a business trip. Female staff members Li Xiangyun and Zhang Maozhi took turns day and night to invite doctors, buy medicine, decoct medicine, serve tea, and specially cook meals for him. After more than twenty days, Zhong Daode recovered his health. Before leaving, he said to the two staff members with tears in his eyes, "Your care is truly like that of my own family."

    Some staff members at the Peace Hotel initially thought that this work was "demeaning" "serving people," and did not contribute to the country as much as participating in industrial and agricultural production. In August of last year, the employees of Chengguan Town in Laifeng County launched a socialist labor competition. After several rounds of airing views and debates, the staff of the Peace Hotel clarified their thinking. They realized that many travelers were traveling north and south, working from dawn to dusk, for the socialist construction of the motherland; serving travelers was serving the people and contributing to socialist construction. From then on, the staff's enthusiasm for labor soared, and everyone regarded doing a good job in service as the greatest glory.

    人人称赞的和平旅社
    新华社记者
    凡是在鄂西山区来凤县和平旅社住过的旅客们，只要一提起和平旅社，就会兴致勃勃地谈论该社服务员们关心旅客、服务周到的许多感人事迹。
    当客车一开进来凤县城汽车站，旅客们就会发现：在车站的一边，和平旅社服务台的服务员们，满脸笑容地迎上前来。他们早就为旅客们准备好热开水，洗脸水和洗刷用品，使旅客们一下车就能洗脸漱口，刷掉身上的灰尘。要是看到有的旅客因旅途颠簸，身心不大舒服，服务员准备了卧榻和人丹、清凉油等药品，让旅客在这里休息养神。旅客们需要在这儿住宿，服务员就争着替旅客背行李、抱小孩、扶老人，热情地把他们引导到旅社去。
    和平旅社看来只是几间简陋的瓦屋，但是经过服务员们辛勤的修饰、打扫，内外显得分外干净明亮。这里有老年旅客专用的特别舒适的房间，也有专供带孩子的母亲用的妇幼间。旅客一进门，服务员就会无微不至地向你问冷问热，帮助你料理旅途中的生活琐事：比如衣服、裤子破了，女服务员会很快给你缝好；旅客们需要汇钱、寄信、买车票和戏票，服务员也准能及时办到。服务员们还在旅社里辟了一间文娱室，备有书刊、象棋、乒乓球和留声机等文娱用品，让旅客们阅读玩乐，消除旅途中的清闲和疲劳。
    更使旅客们难忘的是，当旅客遇到意外的困难时，服务员们就会细心关怀，帮助克服。沙市热水瓶厂采购员钟道德，一次出差到来凤县，不幸一到这地方就病倒了。女服务员李香云、张卯之两人就白天黑夜轮流给他请医生、买药、煎药、端茶、专门给他做饭菜。经过二十多天，钟道德恢复了健康。临别时，他感动得含着眼泪对这两位服务员说：“你们这样的照顾，真像我家里的亲人一样。”
    和平旅社有的服务员在开始做这项工作的时候，认为这是“低三下四”的“侍候人”的工作，没有参加工农业生产对国家贡献大。去年8月，来凤县城关镇职工们掀起社会主义劳动竞赛，和平旅社的服务员们经过几次鸣放辩论。思想亮堂了。他们认识到：许多旅客为了祖国的社会主义建设，起早摸黑，南北奔波；为旅客服务，就是为人民服务，就是为社会主义建设贡献力量。从这以后，旅社的服务员们劳动热情高涨，大家都把做好服务工作当作最大的光荣。
