This newspaper赣州, June 29th: The Pangu Mountain Tungsten Mine in Jiangxi Province has adopted a method of cooperation among "mines, stores, and communes," which has led to the rapid development of non-staple food production. Currently, the entire mining area has planted 3,000 mu of vegetables, raised 2,000 pigs and more than 5,000 chickens and ducks, and established two non-staple food processing plants. On average, each worker in the mine can eat one jin of vegetables per day and two to three jin of pork per month. There is a sufficient supply of non-staple foods such as tofu, soy sauce, fresh eggs, wine, and pastries. In recent months, this mining area has also supported fraternal mining areas with more than 20,000 jin of vegetables each month.

The Pangu Mountain Tungsten Mine is one of the major mines in Jiangxi. In the past, all the non-staple foods needed by the mine were transported from other places. Last year, the number of employees increased rapidly, and the supply of non-staple foods became even more prominent. In the second half of last year, the Party Committee of Pangu Mountain Tungsten Mine, together with the local commercial departments and the commune Party Committee, after joint consultation, adopted the method of cooperation among the mine, the store, and the commune under the unified leadership of the mine Party Committee. Based on the needs of the employees and the characteristics of each entity, they jointly developed non-staple food production. The three parties formed a non-staple food production committee to unify the production tasks of each entity, organize the supply of the entire mining area, and solve problems in production and supply.

In the development of non-staple food production, the tasks of the mine are: First, to mobilize employees to use their spare time to reclaim idle land and wasteland to grow melons and vegetables; second, to help employees' families set up sideline production groups, use small plots of land in front of and behind their houses to grow vegetables, and raise poultry and livestock; third, to organize various employee canteens to use existing equipment conditions to raise a large number of livestock and poultry. Currently, all employees and their families in the mine have planted more than 500 mu of melons and vegetables, raised more than 1,000 pigs and thousands of poultry, achieving everyone growing vegetables, every household raising poultry, and every canteen raising pigs.

The task of the commune is to organize professional teams to open up non-staple food production bases and vigorously plant melons and vegetables and develop livestock and poultry. The mining area commune has currently established two non-staple food production bases with a total area of more than 2,000 mu, planted with more than 30 kinds of vegetables such as green vegetables, eggplants, peppers, pumpkins, cowpeas, and tomatoes, and raised more than 1,000 pigs, more than 3,000 chickens and ducks, and several dairy cows.

The commercial department is the link in the three-party cooperation, so its tasks are: First, to submit the non-staple food production requirements for each period to the non-staple food production committee according to the needs of the employees and the production season; second, to organize the supply of production materials such as vegetable seeds, breeding poultry, breeding livestock, and tools, and help solve the difficulties in non-staple food production; third, to establish supply and sales points according to the distribution of mine employees to ensure timely supply and convenience for employees; fourth, to adopt the method of "taking materials locally, processing locally, and selling locally" to set up non-staple food processing plants. Since the start of cooperation at the end of last year, the commercial department has transported more than 5,000 piglets, chicks, and ducklings and more than 2,000 jin of vegetable seeds from other places to supply the mine and commune to develop non-staple food production, and adopted classroom lectures and on-site teaching methods to help employees' families improve their production techniques. In addition, the commercial department has established two comprehensive non-staple food processing plants, which have used more than 20 kinds of substitutes such as wild plants, taro, and bean dregs to process 40 kinds of non-staple foods such as white wine, soy sauce, and pastries, with an output of 50,000 jin. Among them, the use of acorns to make wine alone not only brewed more than 10,000 jin of wine for employees but also saved the country more than 20,000 jin of grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 29th: Medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas in Sichuan Province are successively establishing non-staple food production bases, vigorously increasing the production of vegetables, live pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits to meet the growing needs of the people in cities and industrial and mining areas.

Zigong City, a famous salt industry center, has increased its vegetable area from 10,000 mu to more than 30,000 mu. Wanxian City has designated land in the suburbs for vegetable cultivation, and the city's vegetable market supply has increased by two times compared with last year. In addition to self-sufficiency, it also supports cities such as Chongqing.

Many government agencies, factories, schools, and residents are also growing vegetables and raising chickens. Wangcang County, a new industrial and mining base in northern Sichuan, has planted more than 17,000 mu of vegetables, which is twice as large as last year, and has used open spaces to plant more than 20 million melon seedlings and more than 200 million nests of beans. Around many industrial and mining bases, scenes of green vegetables in the fields, flocks of chickens and ducks, and pens full of fat pigs have appeared. Each drilling team in the central Sichuan oil area has successively planted vegetables near the construction site, and some teams have achieved self-sufficiency. The No. 2 test oil team of the Nanchong Brigade has planted 270 mu of vegetables, raises an average of one pig for every four people, and also raises more than 1,400 chickens and ducks, releases more than 500 jin of fish fry, and grows its own bean sprouts and grinds tofu.

Many areas, while striving to meet the people's needs for the quantity of non-staple foods, also pay attention to increasing the variety of vegetables and the proportion of fine vegetables. The vegetable professional teams in various communes in Wanxian City have increased the varieties from the original 100 to 250. Nanchong and other places have also established vegetable seed bases, adopting methods such as self-selection, self-retention, self-use, and mutual adjustment to increase varieties and colors. Local commercial and agricultural departments have run technical training classes or sent technical cadres to tour and teach, training technical forces in vegetable planting, chicken and duck hatching and raising, and epidemic prevention for communes, government agencies, industrial and mining enterprises, and schools.

Many government agencies and industrial and mining enterprises, due to their own production of some non-staple foods, have not only improved their food but also reduced costs. After the Guang'an drilling team in the central Sichuan oil area greatly developed non-staple food production, the employees' food expenses were reduced from the original 9 yuan per month to 7 yuan, and they could eat fresh vegetables, fish, and meat every day. The difficulty of purchasing non-staple foods in some remote mining areas has now also been solved as a result. (Sun Yuedong)

    在矿区党委领导下矿山、商店、公社通力合作
    盘古山矿区副食品自给有余
    四川工矿区和中等城市积极建立副食品生产基地
    本报赣州29日电　江西省盘古山钨矿采取“矿山、商店、公社”三家合作的办法，使副食品生产得到了迅速的发展。现在，全矿区已播种三千亩蔬菜，饲养了二千头猪和五千多只鸡鸭，建立了两个副食品加工厂。全矿职工平均每人每天可吃到一斤蔬菜，每月能吃到两斤至三斤猪肉，豆腐、酱油、鲜蛋、酒、糕点等副食品都有较充分的供应。最近几个月，这个矿区每月还有两万多斤蔬菜支援兄弟矿区。
    盘古山钨矿是江西大矿山之一。过去矿山需要的副食品，全靠外地运来。去年职工人数迅速增加，副食品的供应问题就显得更加突出了。去年下半年，盘古山钨矿党委和当地的商业部门、公社党委共同协商，采取在矿区党委统一领导下，矿山、商店、公社三家合作的办法，根据职工需要和各家的特点，共同发展副食品生产。三家组成一个副食品生产委员会，统一安排各家的生产任务，组织全矿区的供应，解决生产和供应中的问题。
    在发展副食品生产中，矿山的任务是：一，发动职工利用工余时间，开垦闲地荒地，种瓜种菜；二、帮助职工家属成立副业生产小组，利用屋前屋后零星小块土地种菜，和饲养家禽家畜；三、组织各个职工食堂运用已有的设备条件，大量饲养家畜家禽。现在全矿职工和家属已播种了五百多亩瓜菜，饲养了一千多头猪和数千只家禽，达到了人人种菜，户户养禽，个个食堂养猪。
    公社的任务是组织专业队，开辟副食品生产基地，大力种植瓜菜和发展家畜家禽。矿区公社目前已建立了两个总面积达二千多亩的副食品生产基地，种有青菜、茄子、辣椒、南瓜、豆角、西红柿等三十多种蔬菜，并饲养了一千多只猪、三千多只鸡、鸭和几头乳牛。
    商业部门是三家合作中的纽带，因此它的任务是：一、根据职工需要和生产季节，向副食品生产委员会提出每个时期的副食品生产要求；二、组织菜籽、种禽、种畜、工具等生产资料的供应，帮助解决副食品生产中的困难；三、按照矿区职工分布情况，建立供销点，保证供应及时，职工方便；四、采取“就地取材、就地加工、就地销售”的办法，开办副食品加工厂。自去年年底开展合作之后，商业部门已从外地运来了五千多只小猪、小鸡、小鸭和两千多斤菜籽供应矿山、公社发展副食品生产，并采取课堂讲解、现场传授的方法，帮助职工家属提高了生产技术。另外，商业部门建立了两个副食品综合加工厂，已利用野生植物、芋头、豆渣等二十多种代用品，加工成了白酒、酱油、糕点等四十种副食品，产量达五万斤。其中利用橡子酿酒一项，不但酿造了一万多斤酒供应职工，还为国家节约了两万多斤粮食。

    本报成都29日电　四川省的中等城市和工矿区，陆续建立副食品生产基地，大力增加蔬菜、生猪和鸡、鸭、鹅、兔生产，以满足城市和工矿区人民日益增长的需要。
    著名的制盐工业中心自贡市，蔬菜面积已由一万亩增加到三万多亩。万县市在郊区划出土地种菜，全市蔬菜上市量已比去年增加两倍，除自给外，还支援重庆等城市。
    许多机关、工厂、学校和居民，也动手种菜养鸡。川北新工矿基地旺苍县，种植蔬菜一万七千多亩，比去年扩大了二倍，并利用空场地种瓜两千多万棵，种豆二亿多窝。不少工矿基地周围，已出现青菜满畦、鸡鸭成群、毛猪满圈的景象。川中油区各个钻探大队，都陆续在工地附近种菜，有的队已做到自给。南充大队试油二队种菜二百七十亩，平均每四人养猪一头，还养鸡鸭一千四百多只，放养鱼苗五百多斤，自己生豆芽、磨豆腐。
    许多地区在尽量满足人民对副食品数量需要的基础上，还注意增加蔬菜的品种和细菜的比重。万县市各公社蔬菜专业队已将品种由原来一百种增加到二百五十种。南充等地还建立了蔬菜种籽基地，采用自选、自留、自用、互相调剂等办法，增加品种花色。各地商业、农业部门开办了技术训练班或派出技术干部巡回传授，为公社、机关、工矿、学校培训了蔬菜种植和鸡鸭的孵抱饲养、防疫方面的技术力量。
    不少机关、工矿单位，由于自己动手生产一部分副食品，不仅伙食改善，而且费用降低。川中油区广安钻探区队，大量发展副食品生产以后，职工伙食费由原来每月九元降为七元，而且每天都能吃上新鲜蔬菜和鱼、肉。一些偏僻矿区购买副食品的困难，现在也因此找到了解决的门径。　（孙跃冬）
