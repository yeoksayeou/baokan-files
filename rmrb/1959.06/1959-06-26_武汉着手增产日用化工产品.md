    新华社武汉25日电　武汉市安排增产四十多种日用化工产品。这些产品包括肥皂、牙膏、盐汽水片、清凉油、合霉素、人造革、玻璃仪器等，其中不少是当前夏令市场上急需的。
    接受增产任务的工厂，都正在积极准备原料、设备和技术力量。中联制药厂已决定抽出一半的设备来生产日常生活必需的一些产品。担负成批塑料制品生产的汉昌化工厂，已确定用六部压机生产纽扣、瓶盖、清凉油盒，以及用聚氯乙烯加工各种表带、腰带、背带和凉鞋鞋面等，同时恢复皂盒、筷子、梳子等塑料制品的生产。现在，新的产品正在赶制模型，原来有模型的产品已经投入生产。
    最近，武汉市化工局成立了专门机构领导日用化工产品的生产，并召集各厂负责人开会，对这四十多种产品逐项地作了安排，分别制定了增产的具体措施。
