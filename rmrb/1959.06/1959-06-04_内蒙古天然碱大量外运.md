Inner Mongolia ships large quantities of natural soda
    The natural soda produced in the Ordos and Xilin Gol grasslands of Inner Mongolia has recently been shipped in large quantities to support industrial production and the needs of the people throughout the country.
    The main soda lakes in the central and western grasslands of Inner Mongolia have produced a total of 260,000 tons of natural soda in the past five months. The trucks sent by fraternal provinces, cities, and the People's Liberation Army are now running day and night, transporting the soda between the soda lakes and the railway in a tense manner.

    内蒙古天然碱大量外运
    内蒙古鄂尔多斯草原和锡林郭勒草原出产的天然碱，最近大量外运，支援全国各地工业生产和人民生活需要。
    内蒙古中部和西部草原上的主要碱湖，在最近五个月里共出产了天然碱二十六万吨。各兄弟省、市和解放军部队派来支援的汽车，现在正不分昼夜，奔驰在碱湖与铁路之间紧张地运输。（附图片）
