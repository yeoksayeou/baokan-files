Plant Mulberry, Grow Tea, Cultivate Woody Oil Materials
Actively Develop Special Economic Forests

    This newspaper reports that the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Guizhou, since this spring, while creating timber forests in the high mountains, have also been planting oil tea, tung trees, and fruit trees in the near mountains, gentle slopes, and shallow mountainous and hilly areas near towns and villages, cultivating mulberry gardens and tea gardens, and actively developing various special economic forests.
    In the Wujiang River banks and Miao mountain areas, which are rich in tung oil, oil tea, and Chinese tallow trees, more woody oil crops have been newly planted this year than in any previous year. Yanhe County, famous for producing tung oil and Chinese tallow oil, has adopted the method of mixed forestry and grain cultivation this year, creating 185,000 mu of tung oil forests and Chinese tallow forests, exceeding the original plan by 85%. The people of Zunyi City have planted hundreds of thousands of fruit trees in the past four months, turning this famous revolutionary historical city into a beautiful city of flowers and fruits. Nationally renowned fruit trees such as the Guoguang apple, Feicheng honey peach, Turpan grape, Shaanxi ginkgo, and Sichuan citrus have taken root and blossomed in the city. Wu Yu Zi is a precious stomachic medicinal material unique to Guizhou Province and has been sold at home and abroad for many years. This year, Tongren, Sinan, Yinjiang and other counties, the main producing areas of Wu Yu Zi, planted 1.5 million Wu Yu trees. According to the latest statistics from the Guizhou Provincial Forestry Department, among the 15.52 million mu of new forests created this year, various special economic forests account for 7.88 million mu, and fruit trees account for 740,000 mu, totaling 56% of the total afforestation area.
    This year, in the development of forestry production, the people in the mountainous areas of Guizhou, in light of the characteristics of the Guizhou Plateau, have vigorously developed diversified operations in accordance with local conditions, giving equal importance to economic forests and timber forests, and focusing on woody oil materials in economic forests. After the Spring Festival, the afforestation army across the province planted various trees like planting crops. From late February, 270,000 people in Zunyi Prefecture went to the mountains every day to plant pine and fir trees, and cultivate mulberry trees, tea trees, fruit trees, and Qinggang trees, implementing the policy of guaranteeing planting, survival, and forest formation. Dafang County, which is rich in raw lacquer, planted 100,000 mu of lacquer trees this year, which is equal to the total lacquer forest created in the first nine years after liberation. After a month of shock work, Changshi People's Commune in the county cultivated 10,000 mu each of raw lacquer mountain, tea mountain, and tung oil mountain, and also opened up 2,750 mu of fruit tree forests and medicinal material forests. The communes in the suburbs of Anshun City, which have a long history of tea production, have also launched a campaign for each person to cultivate 1,000 tea seedlings. The Lin farmers of all ethnic groups in Jinping County, Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, who once created high-yield and abundant production of Chinese fir, requested that tung trees bear fruit in three years and yield abundantly in five years; Eucommia ulmoides trees, which can be used to refine special hard glue and treat hypertension, should also grow to maturity in four years.

    栽桑种茶培植木本油料
    积极发展特用经济林
    本报讯　贵州山区各族人民，今春以来，在高山营造用材林的同时，在近山、缓坡和城镇、村庄附近的浅山丘陵地带，栽种油茶、油桐和果树，培植桑园、茶园，积极发展各种特用经济林。
    在盛产油桐、油茶、乌桕的乌江两岸、苗岭山区，今年新种的木本油料作物比任何一年要多，以产桐油、乌桕油著名的沿河县，今年采取林粮混作的办法，营造油桐林、乌桕林十八万五千亩，超过原计划85％。遵义市人民在过去四个月中，又新栽种几十万株果树，把这座革命历史名城，打扮成一个美丽的花果城。全国著名的国光苹果、肥城蜜桃、吐鲁番葡萄、陕西银杏和四川柑桔等果树，已在市内生根开花。吴芋子是贵州省特产的一种珍贵健胃药材，历年都远销国内外，今年，吴芋子的主要产地铜仁、思南、印江等县，种植吴芋树一百五十万株。据贵州省林业厅最近统计，在今年新营造的一千五百五十二万亩林木中，各种特用经济林有七百八十八万亩，果树有七十四万亩，这两项共占总造林面积56％。
    今年贵州山区人民在发展林业生产中，针对贵州高原特点，因地制宜大搞多种经营，经济林和用材林并重，在经济林中又以木本油料为主。春节过后，全省各地造林大军就像种庄稼一样营造各种林木，遵义专区2月下旬每天有二十七万人上山种植松杉，和栽培桑树、茶树、果树和青杠树，实行包栽包活包成林。盛产生漆的大方县，今年种漆树十万亩，等于解放后头九年所造漆林的总和。这个县的长石人民公社经过一个月的突击，培植了万亩生漆山、茶叶山、油桐山各一个，还开辟了果树林、药材林二千七百五十亩。生产茶叶有悠久历史的安顺市郊各公社，还开展了一个每人培育千株茶苗的运动。曾经创造杉木快速高额丰产的黔东南苗族侗族自治州锦屏县的各族林农，要求油桐三年结果，五年丰产；可提炼特种硬胶和治疗高血压的杜仲树，也要提前在四年内长成。
