    A Model Example
    The example of the Qingdao Medical College Affiliated Hospital, where traditional Chinese and Western medicine unite and cooperate to improve medical standards, once again illustrates that if traditional Chinese and Western medicine in any medical unit can do this in clinical practice, it is possible to make significant achievements in exploring the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine.
    The crucial issue of unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine in clinical practice, which is the key to implementing the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, has not been resolved in a few medical units. Some people believe that traditional Chinese and Western medicine do not have a common language in the diagnosis and treatment process and cannot be brought together, so they have little confidence in unity and cooperation. These situations cannot be said to be normal.
    Traditional Chinese and Western medicine are two different systems, and in the process of unity and cooperation, many ideological and practical problems will inevitably arise. However, they have a common scientific basis. Only through unity and cooperation in clinical practice, continuous exchange of experience, development of scientific research, mutual learning, and concerted efforts to create a new medicine for the motherland, will the languages of traditional Chinese and Western medicine gradually converge.
    Under the current circumstances, the Party committees of all medical units need to strengthen their leadership, make specific and meticulous arrangements for this work, and promote the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. In the previous period, many medical units, like Qingdao Medical College, have provided valuable experience in this regard. May the bright flowers of unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine bloom in hospitals across the country!

### 一个范例

    一个范例
    青岛医学院附属医院中西医团结合作，提高了医疗水平的事例，又一次说明，任何一个医疗单位的中西医能在临床实践中这样做，都有可能在发掘祖国医学宝库方面做出显著成绩。
    中西医临床实践中团结合作这一贯彻党的中医政策的关键性问题，在少数医疗单位中还没有解决。有的人认为：中西医在诊断和医疗过程中还没有共同语言，拧不到一起，因而对团结合作的信心不大。这些情况不能说是正常的。
    中西医学是两个不同的体系，在团结合作的过程中，难免产生许多思想问题和实际问题。但是，它们有着共同的科学基础。只有通过在临床实践中的团结合作，不断地交流经验，发展科学研究，互相学习，协力创造祖国的新医学，中西医的语言就会逐渐走向一致。
    在当前的情况下，需要各医疗单位的党委加强领导，对这一工作进行具体而周密的安排，以促进中西医的团结合作。在前一段时期中，已有很多医疗单位像青岛医学院一样，在这方面提供了宝贵经验。愿全国各医院都将盛开中西医团结合作的鲜艳花朵！
