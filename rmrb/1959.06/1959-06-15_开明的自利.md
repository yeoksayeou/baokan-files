    "Enlightened Self-Interest"
    As the contradictions between the United States and the Philippines continue to develop, the United States Ambassador to the Philippines, Bohlen, attempted to defend the United States' imperialist policy in the Philippines by saying that this policy is "enlightened self-interest."
    Self-interest is, of course, self-interest, but it is "enlightened." This is indeed a unique and wonderful argument. Bohlen certainly would not dare to cite a single fact to illustrate how dirty the self-interest of the United States is, but when it came to the "enlightened" aspect, he was also extremely nervous. He could only boast about the "aid" and loans that the United States gave to the Philippines. Therefore, Bohlen's efforts to make the enslaved Filipinos appreciate its "great kindness and virtue" like "a falling head praising a quick knife" did not succeed, but instead provoked a strong counterattack from the Filipinos.
    Columnist Nakpil of the Philippine "Manila Chronicle" refuted Bohlen's boast of US "aid" and said, "Most colonialists and imperialists like this argument. They explain that their imperialist adventures suffered huge losses and paid huge sums of money for it, trying to convince their victims how evangelical and selfless their activities are." Philippine Senator Recto also listed the facts that the United States forcibly occupied bases, plundered resources, and refused to pay compensation in the Philippines, and criticized Bohlen's hypocritical face, saying: "If this is the example of enlightened self-interest in the ambassador's mind, then I dare not imagine what unenlightened self-interest will mean."
    It can be seen how Bohlen and his like want to cover up the naked bandit face of the United States in the name of "enlightenment" is self-defeating. Admitting "self-interest" means admitting ugliness, just as admitting a murder weapon means admitting the blood on the knife.

### “开明的自利”

    “开明的自利”
    在美菲矛盾继续发展中，美国驻菲律宾大使波伦企图替美国在菲律宾的帝国主义政策作辩解，说什么这个政策是“开明的自利”。
    自利固然是自利，却是“开明”的，此诚别出心裁的妙论也。波伦当然不敢举一件事实来说明一下美国的自利究竟有多么脏，但说到“开明”之处，也极为心虚，他只能对美国给菲律宾的“援助”和贷款吹嘘一番。因此，波伦想使被奴役的菲律宾人像“落地人头称好快刀”那样地感激它的“大恩大德”的努力，并没有得逞，反而招来了菲律宾人的有力的反击。
    菲律宾“马尼拉纪事报”专栏作家纳克皮耳反驳波伦对美“援”的吹嘘说：“大多数殖民主义者和帝国主义分子喜欢这种论据。他们解释说，他们的帝国主义冒险遭到了巨大的损失，并且为之付出了巨额款项，企图以此来使他们的受难者相信，他们的活动是多么合乎福音和多么无私。”菲律宾参议员雷克托也列举美国在菲律宾强占基地、掠夺富源、拒绝支付赔偿等事实，抨击波伦的伪善面孔说：“如果这就是这位大使心目中开明的自利的事例的话，那么我就不敢设想不开明的自利将意味着什么了。”
    可见，波伦之流想假“开明”之名来掩盖美国赤裸裸的强盗面目，是如何弄巧成拙。承认“自利”就得承认丑恶，正如承认杀人的刀就得承认刀上的血一样。
