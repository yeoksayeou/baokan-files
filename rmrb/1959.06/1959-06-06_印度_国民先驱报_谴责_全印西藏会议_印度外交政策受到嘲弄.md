Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 4th. The "National Herald" published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "Tibet and Tears," condemning the absurd decisions of the so-called "All India Tibet Conference" recently held in Calcutta.

The newspaper, referring to the "All India Tibet Conference's" proposal to establish a "Tibet Situation Investigation Committee," said, "The entire effect of this committee's movement will be to mock the entire foundation of Indian foreign policy and its main purpose, and to exert pressure on the Indian government to force it to abandon this policy."

The newspaper condemned the demand for "Tibetan independence." It said, "An independent Tibet is just another base for the West to carry out subversion and conspiracy against China and possibly against India."

The newspaper said, "For India, demanding Tibetan independence would invite open conflict with China, which would mean bidding farewell to the non-aligned policy."

The newspaper said that the most significant result of the development of the Tibetan situation is that the Indian "People's Socialist Party and the Indian People's Union have become closer to each other." Their holding of the so-called "All-Party Tibet Conference" in Jullundur and the "All India Tibet Conference" in Calcutta prove this point. The newspaper pointed out that the participation of some sectarian factions such as the Akali Party of Punjab in the Calcutta conference "did not make the conference more representative."

The newspaper believes that "conditions must be created to enable Tibetans to live peacefully and with dignity in their own land, and to enable the Dalai Lama to return to his capital, but if China believes that the resolutions passed at the meetings in Jullundur and Calcutta represent Indian opinion—which they do not—the result will be counterproductive."

### 印度“国民先驱报”谴责“全印西藏会议”  印度外交政策受到嘲弄

    印度“国民先驱报”谴责“全印西藏会议”
    印度外交政策受到嘲弄
    新华社新德里4日电　“国民先驱报”在3日以“西藏和眼泪”为题发表社论，谴责最近在加尔各答举行的所谓“全印西藏会议”的荒谬决定。
    这家报纸谈到“全印西藏会议”提出的成立“西藏情况调查委员会”的建议时说，“这个委员会运动的全部效果，将是嘲弄印度外交政策的整个基础及其主要目的，对印度政府施加压力，迫使它放弃这个政策。”
    这家报纸谴责要求“西藏独立”的主张。它说，“独立的西藏只是西方对中国而且还可能对印度进行颠覆和阴谋活动的另一个基地。”
    这家报纸说，“对印度说来，要求西藏独立，那就会招致对中国的公开冲突，这就意味着同不结盟政策告别。”
    这家报纸说，西藏事态的发展最显著的结果是，印度“人民社会党和印度人民同盟彼此更加接近了”，他们在朱龙多城举行所谓“各党派西藏会议”和在加尔各答召开的“全印西藏会议”证明了这一点。这家报纸指出，像旁遮普邦阿卡利党这样一些教族小派别参加加尔各答会议，“并没有使这次会议更具有代表性”。
    这家报纸认为，“必须创造条件使西藏人有可能在自己的土地上和平而体面地生活，并使达赖喇嘛有可能返回他的首府，但是如果中国认为，像在朱龙多城和在加尔各答举行的会议上所通过的决议代表印度的意见——它们并不代表印度的意见——结果将是适得其反。”
