“Eating doesn't make you poor, dressing doesn't make you poor, but failing to plan leads to lifelong poverty.” Song Xinzhi, a storekeeper and Communist Party member at a military school of the People's Liberation Army, often thinks of this folk saying in his work; he always keeps the big picture in mind, starts with small things, practices careful calculation, and saves state assets bit by bit.

Song Xinzhi's school has more than three thousand people, and his work is quite complicated and trivial, from pots, bowls, ladles, basins, ink, paper to bedding and equipment, all of which he manages, including procurement, storage, and distribution. Originally, this work was done by two people, but after streamlining, he now does it alone. He constantly considers how to manage this "big household" to the satisfaction of everyone and be frugal everywhere.

He often tells people that it is not easy to waste goods in batches, but a piece of paper, an ink bottle, or a mop handle are often wasted because people consider them insignificant. Last year, he did the math: the whole school uses more than 1,200 bottles of ink a year, and buying them from the street costs 2 jiao 3 fen per bottle. If he collects the empty bottles from each unit, buys large bottles of ink and refills them himself, each bottle only costs 1 jiao. So he collected ink bottles everywhere, washed them himself, and refilled them himself. In the past two years, he has saved nearly 300 yuan in ink expenses for the public. The whole school uses four to five hundred mops a year. Buying new ones costs 1 yuan 2 jiao each. He picks up broken mop handles, uses old cloth and asks workers to tie them, which only costs 4 jiao each. By doing this, he saves more than 200 yuan for the public every year. Even a small worn-out broom, Song Xinzhi picks it up and sends it to the driving squad to brush the cars, which saves money and is easy to use. In this item alone, he has saved more than 240 yuan for the public.

Once, an assistant came to collect office supplies and received a dip pen holder that he had used in the past. The assistant was surprised and asked how this pen holder got to the warehouse. Song Xinzhi said: it was picked up from the trash can, washed, and then saved. The assistant was very touched and quickly spread the word about this. Song Xinzhi took this opportunity to publicize the benefits of waste utilization to everyone, and with the approval of the leaders, he implemented a system of exchanging old items for new ones. From then on, broken bottles and jars were sent in. Song Xinzhi sorted them out by category. Those that could be repaired were repaired, and those that could continue to be used were used. Those that could not be used were sold to the supply and marketing cooperative to collect scraps. In the past two years, he has saved more than 4,300 yuan for the country from renovating old items and selling scraps.

Last year, the school demolished several old thatched sheds, and the small bamboo poles that were dismantled were discarded all over the ground. Song Xinzhi, as usual, cleaned them up. The cooks wanted to take them to burn as firewood, but he said it was a pity to burn them, and it was good to keep them for future use. Soon, the school needed a batch of spittoon brushes, but the local processing plant could not supply them because they lacked brush handles. He thought of the small bamboo poles he had collected and sawed them into more than six hundred brush handles overnight and sent them to the processing plant. The school had spittoon brushes, and the processing plant was also very satisfied.

The several large warehouses managed by Song Xinzhi are all cleaned up and arranged in an orderly manner. In the past few years, the materials he managed have never suffered from mold, insect infestation, or loss of a single thread. A batch of leather shoes had been stored in the warehouse for a long time, and the uppers were a bit stiff. He used shoe polish to polish them whenever he had time, so that the uppers of the batch of leather shoes were as soft as new. Another time, the training team borrowed a batch of helmets, and when they were returned, there was some mud on them. Others said that it was normal for helmets to have mud on them and it was okay to store them. He said no, in order to extend the life of the materials, they must be clean, so he washed them one by one, applied oil, and packaged them.

Song Xinzhi is also known for his initiative, enthusiasm, and ability to understand the difficulties of others. Before the "May Day" holiday this year, the school had a general cleaning. That day was a Sunday. He got up early and loaded brooms, rags, buckets, etc. onto a tricycle, and pedaled from door to door to deliver them. After the cleaning, he pedaled the tricycle to collect the brooms, etc., so that the comrades could rest earlier. Once, the Third Battalion was conducting field exercises and encountered heavy rain, and the tents were leaking. After he found out, he pedaled a tricycle and delivered a batch of new tents. Others saw that he was soaked like a drowned chicken and advised him to rest for a while. He said that he was afraid that the tents of other battalions were also leaking, so he had to hurry up and take a look. So he pedaled the tricycle again. He said: it is a small matter for individuals to get a little wet and catch a cold, but if everyone does not rest well and does not have the energy to exercise the next day, that is a big matter.

Perhaps some people think that Song Xinzhi is a gentle old man, but he is actually only thirty-one years old this year. Since joining the army in 1948, he has served as a soldier, clerk, receptionist, and squad leader. In his work, he has always been diligent and hardworking, and willing to bear hardships and stand hard work. He had never attended school before joining the army. After joining the army, he studied whenever he had time, and now he has a junior high school education. In his childhood, he herded cattle, farmed the land, suffered from cold, and went hungry in his hometown in Henan. He often says: The Party educated me and raised me into adulthood. Whenever I think of the Party, I am determined to do my best to do the work entrusted to me by the organization.

This comrade, who happily and excellently carries out the "ordinary" work of a storekeeper, is often rewarded and commended in the school. Last year, he was twice named a "Five-Good" pacesetter and won the honorary title of "Advanced Individual in Army Building". In May this year, he also attended the Second Congress of Advanced Units and Activists in Logistics Work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The generals and officers and soldiers in the school affectionately call Song Xinzhi "the young good housekeeper" whenever they mention him. (Attached picture)

    好管家人
    新华社记者　成一
    “吃不穷，穿不穷，打算不到一世穷。”人民解放军某军事学校保管员、共产党员宋心芝，在工作中经常想起这句民间谚语；处处从大处着眼，小处着手，精打细算，一点一滴地为国家节省资财。
    宋心芝所在的学校有三千多人，他的工作相当繁杂、琐碎，从锅、碗、瓢、盆、墨水、纸张到被服装具都要管，而且包括采购、保管和发放。本来这些工作是两个人干的，经过整编，现在由他一个人干。他的脑子里时刻盘算着，怎样把这个“大家务”管理得人人满意，处处节俭。
    他常常对人说，整批的物资有时倒不容易浪费，一张纸、一个墨水瓶，一根拖把柄往往被人们认为无足轻重的东西而造成浪费。前年，他算了一笔账，全校每年要用墨水一千二百多瓶，到街上买，每瓶要二角三，如果把各单位的空瓶收回来，买大瓶墨水自己灌，每瓶只要一角多。于是他到处收墨水瓶，自己洗，自己灌，两年来为公家节约墨水经费近三百元。全校每年要用拖把四、五百把，买新的每把一元二，把坏拖把柄拾回来，用旧布请工人扎，每把只有四角钱，他这样做每年又为公家省下二百多元。一把小扫帚用秃了，宋心芝也要拾回来，送给驾驶排刷汽车，既省钱又好用。就这一项他曾为公家节约了二百四十多元。
    有一次，一位助理员来领办公用品，拿到一支他过去用过的蘸水钢笔杆，这位助理员惊讶地问这支笔杆是怎样到仓库的？宋心芝说：是从垃圾箱里拾来洗过后保存起来的。这位助理员很感动，并且很快把这件事传开了。宋心芝就利用这个机会向大家宣传废物利用的好处，并取得领导同意，实行了缴旧换新的制度。从此以后，破瓶烂罐都送来了。宋心芝把它们分门别类地整理好，能修的修，能继续用的就用，实在不能用的他卖给供销合作社收破烂的。近两年，他从旧物翻新、卖破烂中为国家节下了四千三百多元。
    去年，学校里拆了几座旧茅草棚，拆下的小毛竹丢弃满地，宋心芝和往常一样，把它收拾起来。炊事员要拿去烧火，他说烧了可惜，保存着有备无患。不久，学校需要一批痰盂刷，当地的加工厂因为缺少刷柄不能供应。他想起了自己收存的小毛竹，连夜把它锯成六百多条刷柄，送往加工厂。学校里有了痰盂刷，加工厂也很满意。宋心芝管理的几个大仓库，都打扫得干干净净，整理得有条不紊。几年来，他管理的物资，从来没有发生过霉烂、虫蚀和丢失一针一线的事故。有一批皮鞋在仓库存放很久，鞋面有些发硬。他有空就用鞋油擦，使这批皮鞋的鞋面又柔软如新。还有一次，集训队借去一批钢盔，送还时上面有点泥。别人说钢盔有泥是常事，存起来没关系。他说不行，要使物资延长寿命，非整洁不可，就一顶顶地把它洗好，擦上油包装起来。
    宋心芝还以主动、热忱，善于体贴别人困难而闻名。今年“五一”节前夕，学校里大扫除。那天正是星期日。他一早起来把扫帚、擦布、水桶等装上了三轮车，自己蹬着挨门逐户地送去，扫除结束后，他又蹬着三轮车把扫帚等收拾起来，让同志们早点休息。有一次，三营在野外演习，遇到大雨，帐篷漏水，他知道了以后，蹬着三轮车送去一批新帐篷。别人看他淋得像个落汤鸡，劝他休息一下，他说恐怕别的营帐篷也漏水，要赶快去看看。于是又蹬着三轮车走了。他说：个人挨点淋，受点冻是小事，大家休息不好，第二天没有精神演习，那是大事。
    或许有人认为宋心芝是个性情温厚的老头，实际上他今年才三十一岁。他从1948年入伍以来，当过战士、公务员、招待员、公务班长。他在工作中，一贯勤勤恳恳，任劳任怨。他入伍以前没有读过书，入伍后一有空就学习，现在已经具有初中的文化程度了。童年时代，他在河南老家放过牛，种过田，挨过冻，受过饿。他常常说：党把我教养成人，我一想到党，就决心把组织交付给我的工作尽力做好。
    这位愉快地、出色地干着“平凡”的保管员工作的同志，在学校里经常受到奖励和表扬。去年两次被评为“五好”标兵，获得“建军先进分子”的光荣称号。今年5月间，他又出席了中国人民解放军第二次后勤工作先进单位和积极分子代表会议。学校里的将军们和官兵们一提起宋心芝就亲昵地称他为“年轻的好管家”。（附图片）
