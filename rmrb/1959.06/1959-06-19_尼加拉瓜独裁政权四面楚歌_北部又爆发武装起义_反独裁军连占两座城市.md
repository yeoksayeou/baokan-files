Xinhua News Agency, June 18th, Managua dispatch: The anti-dictatorial armed struggle in Nicaragua continues to develop and has achieved new victories in combat.

It is reported that a new, large-scale armed uprising broke out in the Las Segovias mountains of northern Nicaragua on the 16th, receiving widespread support from residents.

According to a statement issued on the 15th by the Nicaraguan anti-government side, Nicaraguan anti-dictatorial armed forces recently occupied the cities of Santo Tomás and León, northwest of Managua, and seized a large amount of military equipment. Prior to this, anti-dictatorial armed forces engaged government troops in a battle on the 9th in the city of Boaco, sixty miles northeast of Managua, killing eighty-six National Guardsmen.

The radio station also stated that many guerrillas and farmers have joined the anti-dictatorial army and have armed themselves with weapons seized from the Boaco battle.

Because a portion of the anti-dictatorial armed personnel led by Nicaraguan conservatives surrendered to government troops in early June, the dictator Somoza took advantage of this to publicize that the anti-government forces had been "eliminated."

Armando Amador, a member of the Nicaraguan Revolutionary Committee and a member of the National Committee of the Socialist Party, recently commented on this matter. He said that the surrender of the armed conservative youth is not a disaster. The five resistance parties operating within the country are still persisting in the main armed struggle under the command of Hernán Agüello of the Independent Liberal Party. It is reported that among Agüello's troops are veterans who fought against the United States Marine Corps thirty-two years ago under the national hero Sandino. This force is operating in the northwestern region of Managua and has achieved important victories.

    尼加拉瓜独裁政权四面楚歌
    北部又爆发武装起义　反独裁军连占两座城市
    新华社18日讯　马那瓜消息：尼加拉瓜反独裁武装斗争仍在发展，并在战斗中取得新的胜利。
    据悉，尼加拉瓜北部拉斯塞哥维亚斯山区16日爆发了一次新的规模巨大的武装起义，这次起义得到居民的广泛支持。
    据尼加拉瓜反政府方面15日宣布，尼加拉瓜反独裁武装部队最近占领了马那瓜西北部的圣托马斯城和雷翁城，并且掳获了大量军事装备。在这以前，反独裁武装部队曾在9日离马那瓜东北六十英里的博阿科城和政府军发生战斗，击毙了八十六名国民警卫军。
    电台还说，有许多游击队和农民参加了反独裁的军队，并且用从博阿科战役中掳获的武器武装了自己。
  由于尼加拉瓜保守党人领导的一部分反独裁武装人员6月上旬向政府军投了降，索摩查独裁者曾利用这件事大肆进行宣传，说什么反政府的部队已经被“消灭”。
    尼加拉瓜革命委员会委员、社会主义党全国委员会委员阿曼多·阿马多尔最近就这件事发表了谈话。他说，保守党武装青年的投降并不是一个灾难。在国内进行活动的五个抵抗党派仍在独立自由党埃尔南·阿格略指挥下坚持主要的武装斗争。据报道，在阿格略的队伍中有三十二年前在民族英雄桑迪诺手下同美国海军陆战队交过手的老兵。这支部队在马那瓜西北部地区进行活动，并且取得了重要的胜利。
