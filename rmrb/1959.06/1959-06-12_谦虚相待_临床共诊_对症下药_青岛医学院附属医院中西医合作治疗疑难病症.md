Treating Each Other with Humility, Joint Clinical Diagnosis, Prescribing the Right Medicine:
Qingdao Medical College Affiliated Hospital Uses Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine to Treat Difficult and Complex Diseases

(Reported by this newspaper) Under the leadership of the Party, the doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western medicine at Qingdao Medical College Affiliated Hospital unite and cooperate, learning from each other, resulting in a significant improvement in medical standards, overcoming many difficult and complex diseases that were previously considered "incurable."

In addition to the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Traditional Chinese Medicine ward with more than 40 beds specifically for patient treatment, other departments in this hospital also frequently adopt the method of integrated Traditional Chinese and Western medicine to diagnose and treat various diseases, especially difficult and complex diseases. Sometimes doctors of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine hold simultaneous outpatient clinics, inspect wards together, and for certain special diseases, they adopt the form of consultation to jointly study the condition and agree on treatment plans, coordinating the use of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Doctors of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine also often use both diagnostic and treatment methods. During treatment, based on different conditions, some patients mainly take Chinese medicine with Western medicine injections as a supplement; some use both Chinese and Western medicine; and some only take Chinese medicine while receiving care using modern medical methods. When the condition is critical, Western medicine is used for emergency treatment; if a patient is unable to take Chinese medicine due to certain circumstances, it is administered through a nasal feeding tube.

Due to the close integration of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine, concentrating the strengths of both, the therapeutic effect has gradually improved. Not long ago, this hospital received a patient suffering from acute, infectious, polyneuritis and concurrent ascending paralysis. At that time, the condition was extremely critical, the patient's pharyngeal reflex disappeared, and food and water could not be ingested, with breathing also very difficult. In the past, Western medicine was almost helpless against this disease, and Traditional Chinese medicine also considered it incurable. However, under the leadership of the Party General Branch, doctors of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine cooperated closely, actively adopting various effective medical measures. Western medicine used methods such as continuous blood transfusions, injections of cardiac stimulants, and glucose to try to maintain the patient's life; Traditional Chinese medicine used Chinese medicine combined with scraping therapy for treatment; if the patient could not swallow the medicine, Western doctors used a nasal catheter to administer it. After six days of emergency treatment, the patient was out of danger; the patient was discharged from the hospital after twenty days and had resumed studies. For patients with thromboangiitis obliterans, the combination of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine is used, with accurate therapeutic effects. For purulent appendicitis, biliary ascariasis, biliary calculi and other diseases, without surgery, only by taking Chinese medicine combined with injections of antibiotics and other methods, several cases have also been cured, and some experience in integrated Traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment has been gained.

In the cooperative treatment of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine, proceeding from the idea of everything for the patient, both sides treat each other with humility, frankly discuss treatment methods, and learn from each other. The Western doctors in each department have great respect for Traditional Chinese medicine. When encountering difficult and complex diseases, they ask Traditional Chinese medicine doctors for consultation or adopt Traditional Chinese medicine methods for treatment, and humbly learn from Traditional Chinese medicine. Now, all Western medical staff in this hospital have learned acupuncture, massage therapy, and plum-blossom needle therapy. Doctors can prescribe some Chinese medicine formulas and appropriately add or subtract drugs according to the symptoms. For pre- and post-operative sedation and pain relief, they have learned to use acupuncture instead of drugs, which saves financial resources and reduces the patient's pain. Some Traditional Chinese medicine doctors have also learned a lot of modern medical knowledge and, with the help of Western doctors, have mastered diagnostic methods such as auscultation and routine testing of feces, urine, blood, and sputum. The directors of the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, one a Traditional Chinese medicine doctor and the other a Western medicine doctor, signed a contract, teaching and learning from each other, resulting in improvements for both sides.

In the process of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine coexisting, cooperating in treatment, and Western doctors seriously learning from Traditional Chinese medicine, this hospital is also using a new therapy based on the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine: injecting Western medicine drugs according to acupuncture points of Traditional Chinese medicine. It started to be applied in the Department of Neuropsychiatry and has now been developed into internal medicine, surgery and other departments. Clinical practice has proved that, according to different conditions, different acupuncture points are selected, and different drugs are injected, the therapeutic effect is better than using acupuncture or drug treatment alone. Other hospitals in Qingdao have also achieved satisfactory results in promoting and applying this therapy.

While cooperating in treatment, Traditional Chinese and Western medicine are also carrying out scientific research activities. At present, the Department of Internal Medicine is conducting research on the treatment of cirrhosis, and has written a report on two cases of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment of cirrhosis; the Department of Neuropsychiatry is also engaged in research on rapid comprehensive therapy for neurasthenia (integrated use of Traditional Chinese and Western medical methods).

The Party organization of this hospital attaches great importance to the political and ideological work in the united cooperative medical treatment of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine. The Party General Branch has adopted various methods to deeply publicize the Party's Traditional Chinese medicine policy, and continuously educates all personnel based on their thinking, and promptly corrects the various forms of individualism revealed by Traditional Chinese and Western medical personnel in the process of cooperative medical treatment. Therefore, the ideological awareness of Traditional Chinese and Western medical personnel has been greatly improved, laying a solid ideological foundation for the earnest implementation of the Party's Traditional Chinese medicine policy and the cooperative medical treatment of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine.

    谦虚相待　临床共诊　对症下药
    青岛医学院附属医院中西医合作治疗疑难病症
    本报讯  青岛医学院附属医院在党的领导下，中、西医生团结合作，互相学习，使医疗水平显著提高，战胜了很多过去被认为是“不治之症”的疑难病症。
    这所医院除设有中医科和四十多张床位的中医病房，专门对病人进行治疗外，其它各科也经常采取中、西医合作治疗的方法，对各种疾病尤其是疑难病症进行诊治。中、西医有时同时门诊，一起查病房，对某些特殊病症则采取会诊形式，共同研究病情，商定医疗方案，中、西医配合用药。中、西医生也常常兼用两种诊断和治疗方法。在治疗时，根据不同病情，有的以服中药为主，注射西药为辅；有的中、西药并用；也有的只服中药，用现代医学方法进行护理，遇到病情危急时，由西医进行急救；有的病人因某种情况不能服用中药时，即采取鼻饲方法注入。
    由于中、西医密切结合，集中、西医之长，因此疗效逐步提高。这所医院在不久以前，曾接收了一个患急性、传染性、多发性神经炎和并发上升性麻痹的病人，当时病情十分危急，病人咽反射消失，食水不能入，呼吸也很困难。过去西医对这种病几乎束手无策，中医也认为无可挽救。但在党总支领导下，中、西医通力合作，积极采取了各种有效的医疗措施。西医用不断输血、注射强心剂、葡萄糖等药物的办法，尽力维持病人生命；中医用中药并配合以刮痧疗法进行治疗；病人不能吞服药液，西医便用鼻导管射入。经六天急救，病人转危为安；二十天后病人出院，并已复学。对血栓闭塞性脉管炎病人，中、西药配合使用，疗效准确。对脓性的阑尾炎，胆道蛔虫，胆道结石等病，不用开刀、只服中药并结合注射抗生素等办法，也治愈若干病例，并且从中获得了一些中、西医综合治疗的经验。
    中、西医在合作治疗中，从一切为了病人的思想出发，双方谦虚相待，坦率商量治疗办法，互相学习。各科的西医对中医都十分尊重，遇有疑难病症，就请中医会诊或采取中医方法治疗，并且虚心向中医学习。现在，这个医院的所有西医医护人员，都学会了针灸疗法、推拿疗法和梅花针，医生都能开一部分中药成方，并适当随症加减药物。对手术前后的镇静和止痛学会了用针灸代替药物，既节约财物，又减轻了病人的痛苦。有些中医也学会了很多现代医学知识，在西医帮助下掌握了听诊以及检验粪、尿、血、痰的常规等诊断方法。中医科的主任，一位是中医，一位是西医，两人订了合同，互教互学，结果双方都有提高。
    在中、西医共同相处、合作治疗、西医认真向中医学习的过程中，这所医院还在祖国医学与现代医学相结合的基础上，运用一种新的疗法，按中医针灸穴位，注射西医药物。开始在神经精神病科发现应用，现在已发展到内、外等科。临床实践证明，按照不同病情，采取不同针灸穴道，注射不同药物，疗效比单用针灸或药物治疗都好。青岛市其他医院在推广应用这种疗法中，也获得了令人满意的效果。
    中、西医在合作治疗的同时，还开展了科学研究活动。目前，内科正在进行肝硬化治疗的研究，并已写出了中、西医治疗肝硬化二例的报告论文；神经精神病科也正在从事神经衰弱快速综合疗法（中、西医疗法综合并用）的研究。
    这个医院的党组织十分重视中、西医团结合作医疗中的政治思想工作，党总支曾经采取各种方式，深入宣传党的中医政策，针对各种人员的思想，不断进行教育，及时纠正了中、西医务人员在合作医疗过程中暴露出来的形形色色的个人主义思想。因而，大大提高了中、西医务人员的思想觉悟，为切实贯彻党的中医政策，中、西医合作医疗打下了牢固的思想基础。　（王建林）
