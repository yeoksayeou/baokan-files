The spring has returned to the earth. The Labrang People's Commune in the De'ulu City of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is showing a prosperous scene. The Ganxia and Sangke grasslands are lush with pasture, and herds of cattle and sheep resemble fluttering colorful clouds. In the fields of the Daxia River Valley, commune members in various ethnic costumes are busy weeding and topdressing the spring wheat. An endless stream of yaks transports loads of sheep manure for them. People are working hard, singing happily:

	The grassland gives forth the sun; ten thousand miles gleam with gold;
	The grassland will from now on become paradise, slaves trade frowns for smiles,
	The Communist Party's kindness is everlasting.
	Every stream flowing ten thousand miles has a source; where does happiness come from?
	Present a Hada, present a heart,
	Devote our hearts to Chairman Mao, devote our hearts to the Communist Party.

Clearing Away the Dark Clouds to See the Blue Sky

While basking in their happy lives, the members of the Labrang People's Commune never forget the recently vanished yesterday. In those dark days, people had no joy and almost no right to survive. On the Ganxia Grassland, young herdsman Renke recounted such an innocent and brutal murder to the reporter. Bajiao Village is the poorest village on the Ganxia Grassland. The forty-some households here were all forced here by other tribal headmen. In order to live, they had to work and beg in far-off places after sowing in the spring. Even so, the reactionary headmen never let them go, forcing them to graze on a small patch of designated bad pasture, forbidding them to cross the boundary by even a step. When Renke was thirteen years old, a few animals from Bajiao Village crossed the boundary and ate a little green grass on the headman's occupied pasture, and disaster suddenly struck. The terrifying gunfire immediately suffocated the vast grassland. With the gunfire, more than a dozen people immediately fell in pools of blood, and Renke's nine-year-old sister was brutally murdered. When Renke's mother learned of this, she was heartbroken and lived and died with grief, not knowing how many sleepless nights she endured! When the anti-feudal flames of anger swept across the entire Gannan Grassland, Renke and everyone else accused the wolf-hearted headman of his monstrous crimes. Soon after, people's communes were built on the grassland. Now, Renke has become a cadre of the Ganxia Production Brigade.

Moving From Happiness to Happiness

The establishment of the People's Commune has brought a happier life to people of all ethnic groups. At present, settlement centers have been built on the grassland. Each production team has set up public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly in the slave owners' houses, changing the nomadic life that has drifted and wandered for thousands of years. On the Sangke Grassland, the old herdsman Dang Zhibu successfully completed the experiment of changing lambing from winter to spring in his herd in order to improve the survival rate of lambs, making the survival rate of lambs as high as 98% or more. After collectivization, Tibetan women were further liberated. They broke through thousands of years of superstitious thinking and happily went to the fields, becoming a vital force in agricultural production. With the close help of Han and Hui commune members, many of them learned farming techniques such as plowing, sowing, and selecting seeds.

At noon, I walked past the village of the Mankel Production Team. Tents, medicinal materials, and firewood that had not yet been unloaded were piled up in the square. Cheerful laughter came from the public canteen. Curious, the reporter walked over and saw more than twenty male and female commune members sitting cross-legged on felt blankets, eating rich buttered tea, white flour buns, and milk tea while chatting and telling the production brigade leader, Cheke, interesting stories they had heard in the mountains. Captain Cheke noticed me standing at the door and quickly pulled me in, smiling and said, "They are all commune members who went into the mountains to engage in sideline production and have just returned!" Every young and dark face was radiant, looking at the guests with proud eyes, as if to say: Look, the grassy mountains and forests have become our treasure trove, and they are serving us for the first time ever!

Going into the mountains to dig medicinal herbs and chop firewood is the main sideline production of the whole commune. This time into the mountains was the second time. The previous time was before the Spring Festival. The sideline income from these two times can be divided into an average of 20 yuan per person. Captain Cheke gave the reporter an account: Since the establishment of the commune, the sideline income of the Mankel Production Team from digging medicinal herbs, chopping firewood, running transportation, and selling sheep manure and milk, in addition to buying five mules and horses, seven large carts, ten walking plows, and all the refunds of commune members' investments, and the issuance of the commune members' wages for five months this year, there is still a surplus of more than 4,000 yuan. The sideline income from this time into the mountains has not yet been included in the calculation.

A Poem of Unity

The Labrang People's Commune is a multi-ethnic family. In this big family, there are more than 14,000 people of all ethnic groups. They are: Tibetan, Han, Hui, Mongolian, Salar, and Bao'an. Here,械斗(armed fights) and feuds have been completely buried by history. Socialist national friendship is blossoming with colorful flowers.

Listen! An old man on the Mankel Beach by the Daxia River is eloquently talking about a poem of unity:

Mankel Beach is where the Tibetan people have planted highland barley for generations. The clear Daxia River flows quietly from the beach, but the crops suffer from drought every year. The Tibetan people had also wanted to build a canal from the upper reaches of the Daxia River to bring water to the beach to irrigate the highland barley, but the water had to flow through the Zhuangyuan of the Han and Hui people, and they did not agree, so it was never built. There was no way, so they dug two wells on the beach and installed waterwheels. But before people could smile, they were interfered with by the headman Jiwa Sangji. He claimed that digging wells hurt his immortal Qi, smashed the waterwheels, and filled in the wells. However, after the democratic reforms and collectivization, it became a completely different matter. In October of last year, after hearing the news that the Tibetan village was going to build a canal, the Han and Hui ethnic commune members all agreed. They helped their Tibetan brothers fight hard for six days, and finally led a Daxia River water symbolizing unity and friendship onto Mankel Beach. The 78-year-old Tibetan commune member Dang Muzeng, who was ill in bed, heard that the water was on the beach and asked his daughter to help him watch it. Looking at the gurgling water, he said with tears in his eyes: For hundreds of years, our Tibetan people have not only not seen river water on the beach, but we have never even heard of it! Summer floods do not flood the beach, but winter river water has reached the ground. This is all thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!

    草原出太阳　万里闪金光
    本报记者　翟其寅
    春天重回大地。甘南藏族自治州德乌鲁市的拉卜楞人民公社，呈现着一片繁荣的景象。甘甲和桑科两大草原，牧草青葱，成群的牛羊好似彩云飘拂。在大夏河谷的田野上，穿着不同民族服装的社员，正在忙着为春麦锄草，追肥。络绎不绝的牦牛，为她们运送着成驮的羊粪。人们紧张地劳动着，愉快地歌唱着：
    草原出太阳，万里闪金光；
    草原从此变天堂，奴隶愁眉换笑颜，
    共产党的恩情长。
    水流万里总有源，幸福是哪里来？
    献上哈达，献上心，
    将心献给毛主席，将心献给共产党。
    拨开乌云见青天
    当人们沐浴在幸福的生活中的时候，拉卜楞人民公社的社员，从没有忘记刚刚消逝的昨天。在那些黑暗的日子里，人们没有欢笑，几乎没有生存的权利。在甘甲草原上，青年牧民仁科向记者诉说过这样一件无辜、残暴的凶杀事件。八角村，是甘甲草原上一个最穷的村子。这里的四十几户人家，都是被其他部落头人逼来的。为了生活，他们在春天撒种以后，不得不到很远的地方去帮工，乞讨。就是如此，反动头人也从来没有放过他们，强制他们在一小块划定的烂草地上放牧，不准越界一步。仁科十三岁的那年，八角村有几头牲口越出地界，在头人霸占的草地上吃了一点青，大祸便突然从天而降。恐怖的枪声，顿时窒息了辽阔的草原。随着枪声，十几个人立即倒在血泊里，仁科一个九岁的妹妹，也被活活残杀了。仁科的母亲知道了这件事，悲愤得死去活来，不知熬过了多少个不眠的黑夜！当反封建的怒火燃遍整个甘南草原的时候，仁科和大家一道，控诉了狼心狗肺的头人的滔天罪行。不久以后，草原上又建起了人民公社。现在，仁科已经成为甘甲生产大队的一个干部。
    从幸福走向幸福
    人民公社的建立，给各族人民带来了更幸福的生活。目前，草原上已经建起了定居中心，每个生产队都在奴隶主的住房内，办起了公共食堂、托儿所和敬老院，改变了漂泊流浪了千百年的游牧生涯。桑科草原上的老牧人当智布，为了提高羔羊的成活率，在他牧放的羊群里，成功地完成了改冬天产羔为春天产羔的试验，使羔羊的成活率高达98％以上。公社化后，藏族妇女也进一步获得了解放。她们冲破了千百年来的迷信思想，愉快地走上田间，成为农业生产上的一支生力军。在汉族和回族社员的亲密帮助下，她们中的许多人学会了扶犁、摆耧、选种等耕作技术。
    中午，我走过曼克尔生产队的村前。广场上堆着尚未卸包的帐篷、药材和柴枝。公共食堂里，传出愉快的笑声。记者好奇地走过去，看到二十多个男女社员盘膝坐在毡毯上，一边吃着丰美的酥油、白面花卷和奶茶，一边谈笑风生，向生产大队长切柯讲述着在山林中有趣的见闻。切柯队长发现我站在门口，连忙把我拉进去，笑着说道：“他们都是进山搞副业的社员，方才回来！”年轻黝黑的脸上个个容光焕发，用骄傲的目光瞧着客人，好像在说：你瞧，草山，森林已经变成了我们的聚宝盆，它破天荒地为我们服务了！
    进山挖药材、砍柴，是全社主要副业生产。这一次进山，已是第二次了。上一次，是在春节以前。这两次的副业收入，每人平均可以摊到二十元。切柯队长给记者算了一笔账：公社成立以后，曼克尔生产队挖药材、砍柴、跑运输、卖羊粪和牛奶的副业收入，除买骡马五匹，大车七辆，步犁十副和全部退还社员投资、发放今年五个月的社员工资以外，还结余四千多元。这次进山搞的副业收入，尚未计算在内。
    团结的诗篇
    拉卜楞人民公社，是一个多民族的大家庭。在这个大家庭里，有着一万四千多各族人民。他们是：藏、汉、回、蒙古、撒拉和保安。在这里，械斗和仇杀，已被历史彻底埋葬。社会主义的民族友谊，开放着鲜花异彩。
    听！大夏河畔的曼克尔滩上的一位老者，又在娓娓动听地谈论着团结的诗篇：
    曼克尔滩，是藏族人民世世代代种青稞的地方。清清的大夏河水，平静地从滩下流过；但是，庄稼却年年遭旱。藏族人民也曾想从大夏河上游修一道渠，把水引上滩灌溉青稞，水要流过汉、回民的庄院，他们不同意，终未修成。没有办法，他们便在滩上打了两眼水井，并装上了水车。但人们还未笑出声来，便遭到了头人吉哇桑吉的干涉。他借口打井伤了他的仙气，砸坏了水车，填平了水井。民主改革和公社化后，却成了另外一回事情。去年10月，汉、回民族社员，听说藏民村要修渠的消息后，个个赞成。他们帮助藏族兄弟苦战了六天，终于把一股象征着团结、友谊的大夏河水，引上了曼克尔滩。七十八岁病在床上的藏族社员当木增，听说水上了滩，就叫他的女儿扶着自己去观看。他看着淙淙的流水，含着热泪说：几百年来，我们藏民不但没有看见过河水上滩，连听都没有听过！夏天洪水漫不上滩，冬天河水却上了地，这都是共产党、毛主席领导的好！
