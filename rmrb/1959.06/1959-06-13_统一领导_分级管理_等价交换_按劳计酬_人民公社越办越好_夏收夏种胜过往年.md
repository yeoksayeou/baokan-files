Unified Leadership　Tiered Management　Equivalent Exchange　Payment Based on Labor
People's Communes Are Getting Better and Better　Summer Harvest and Planting Surpass Previous Years

The wheat harvesting and transportation of Cheng Guan Commune in Pucheng is twice as fast as before communization.
The summer harvest and planting of Kongzhaoguo Commune in Yancheng is more than ten days ahead of previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 12th: In the first busy summer after communization, the Cheng Guan People's Commune in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, arranged the summer harvest work in an orderly manner and the summer harvest progressed quickly and well, once again demonstrating the superiority of the people's commune, in accordance with the principles of unified leadership, tiered management, equivalent exchange, and mutual support.

This year, the wheat of this commune, after processing and management last winter and this spring, grew densely and tall, better than any previous year. In the past, a laborer could cut four or five mu of wheat per day, but this year, a laborer can only cut about two mu. Similarly, in the past, a large cart could pull five or six mu per day, but this year, it can only pull a little more than one mu per day. Therefore, this year's summer harvest workload has greatly increased. If the summer harvest was carried out by the agricultural cooperatives last year, the harvesting and transportation alone would take more than half a month to complete. However, this year, the Cheng Guan Commune gave full play to the power of having a large population, unified and rationally arranged the summer harvest work, organized labor and animal power cooperation, and completed twice as much harvesting and transportation tasks as last year in the same amount of time.

In April this year, the commune unified the summer harvest work to make comprehensive plans and specific arrangements. Before the wheat harvest, it completed all the farm work that could be done before the summer harvest, reducing the pressure on labor and animal power during the wheat harvest, so that the whole commune could go all out when the wheat harvest began.

Before the summer harvest, the commune also gave full play to the enthusiasm of the commune's industrial transportation, finance and trade and credit, culture, education and health departments, concentrating on preparing for the summer harvest. The industrial transportation department led and helped the teams to manufacture and repair a large number of harvesting, transportation and other tools. The commune's credit department issued loans of 90,000 yuan to purchase summer harvest tools according to the needs of each production team. The commune's central store purchased and exchanged a large number of wooden forks, brooms, reed mats, hemp ropes and other utensils from other places in accordance with the contracts signed with each management area. The commune's warehouse department also held a warehouse on-site meeting in the Zhanfeng Production Team, which had the best warehouse work, to train warehouse staff and prepare the warehouse. Welfare and health departments assisted each team in rectifying more than 500 canteens, nurseries and kindergartens throughout the commune, and trained more than 1,250 cooks, nursery staff, educators and breeders respectively. In addition, the commune also uniformly solved the problems of grain, fodder and feed for some teams during the summer harvest.

After the summer harvest began, the commune, on the basis of the production team arranging labor and animal power, uniformly deployed forces according to the maturity of wheat, and mobilized each production team to support each other in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange, so as to ensure that the summer harvest work was fast and good. In addition to organizing mutual support between production teams, from May 31st to June 5th, the commune uniformly organized mutual support of 3,243 people and 120 carts, harvesting and transporting 22,230 mu of wheat, which played a significant role in ensuring the comprehensive and timely harvesting of wheat. Under the unified leadership of the commune, each team implemented a five-quota system for harvesting and transportation (fixed personnel, fixed plots, fixed time, fixed quantity, fixed quality), and stipulated that in addition to processing and distribution, a part of cash rewards would be paid for exceeding the quota. In this way, the enthusiasm of all the commune members was fully mobilized, and the red flag competition was launched between teams, groups, and individuals, and the efficiency of wheat harvesting was generally improved.

The Cheng Guan Commune also implemented a five-level continuous contracting system (ie, the commune contracted the management area, the management area contracted the production team, the production team contracted the squad, the squad contracted the professional group, and the party members and the Youth League members contracted the households), and implemented the "five-to-the-field" policy for cadres (ie, office work to the field, labor to the field, inspection to the field, meeting to the field, and eating to the field), strengthened the leadership of the summer harvest, and boosted the enthusiasm of the masses. In the rush to harvest and transport, timely measures such as improving the variety of meals were also taken to ensure that the commune members always maintained sufficient energy and high labor enthusiasm, ensuring the successful completion of this year's summer harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Luohe, June 12th: The farmers of the Kongzhaoguo Commune in Yancheng County, Henan Province, made full use of the favorable conditions of the commune in the summer harvest and planting, harvesting and planting quickly, harvesting well, and planting well, further demonstrating the great superiority of the commune. Now, the summer harvest and planting tasks of this commune have been basically completed more than ten days ahead of previous years.

Due to supporting industry and rushing to repair water conservancy projects, the number of young and middle-aged people participating in agricultural production in this commune is more than 3,000 fewer than in the same period last year; however, the labor force投入 into the summer harvest and planting in the entire commune has greatly increased compared with last year. More than 5,000 women who were in charge of household chores during the summer harvest season last year have become the main force in the summer harvest and planting this year because their children have entered nurseries and the complicated cooking labor has been replaced by canteens. Factories, schools, and shops in the commune have launched large-scale cooperation, and have also drawn more than 3,000 people to support the rush to harvest and plant. In particular, the continuous improvement of the commune's labor organization has given full play to labor potential and continuously improved work efficiency, greatly alleviating the tense situation of insufficient labor force. Before the summer harvest, each production team in the commune generally organized seven professional teams for harvesting, transportation, threshing, and sowing according to the strength of the labor force and technical expertise, and implemented a production responsibility system. Each professional team and work group also produced in accordance with small-scale operation plans. According to the commune's statistics: this year, the per capita daily wheat harvesting efficiency has generally increased from 1.5 mu last year to 2 mu, and the wheat transportation efficiency of many teams has doubled. The production efficiency of other tasks such as plowing, sowing, and field management has also increased to varying degrees.

This year, the animal power and tools投入 into the summer harvest and planting in this commune have also greatly increased compared with last year. Among the more than 3,200 draught animals, about 900 were added after communization, of which more than 700 large draught animals were purchased before the summer harvest. The commune's iron and wood factory also produced more than 300 scythes that can harvest more than 10 mu of wheat a day. On the eve of the summer harvest, the commune also spent more than 30,000 yuan to buy back two large-scale power threshers, which can thresh 40,000 jin of grain a day. This situation shows that the economic strength of the commune is much stronger than in the past. Now, the commune has a lot of production funds and public accumulation funds deposited in the bank, and the public accumulation funds alone are more than 10,000 yuan.

After the rectification of the Kongzhaoguo Commune, the principle of unified leadership and tiered management was implemented, and the summer harvest and planting work was arranged reasonably and rationally. The enthusiasm of the masses for rushing to harvest and plant is higher than at any time in the past. The competition movement to compare quality, compare progress, compare multiple crops, and compare work efficiency is developing like a spring breeze and a raging fire. The commune has a large population and strong labor force, and the arrangements for the lives of the masses are more considerate. All 87 canteens in the commune have generally increased the variety of food during the busy summer harvest and planting season to ensure that the commune members eat their fill, eat well, and save money. The commune's commercial staff brought goods to the fields, and medical staff went to the fields to treat diseases. Due to the good service in the canteens and the good disease prevention and control, the attendance rate of the entire commune during the summer harvest and planting period reached 100%, which was significantly higher than in the same period last year.

Now, all of the commune's more than 30,000 mu of wheat have been harvested and transported to the threshing ground, and most of them have been threshed. The sowing task of late autumn crops, which was originally planned to be completed on June 11, was also completed ahead of schedule on the 9th. The quality of the summer harvest and planting has also improved compared with last year. (Attached pictures)

    统一领导　分级管理　等价交换　按劳计酬
    人民公社越办越好　夏收夏种胜过往年
    蒲城城关公社小麦收割运输比公社化前快两倍
    郾城空冢郭公社夏收和夏种比往年提前十多天
    本报西安12日电　在公社化后第一个繁忙的夏季里，陕西省蒲城县城关人民公社按照统一领导、分级管理、等价交换、相互支援的原则，把夏收农活安排得有条有理，夏收进展又快又好，再一次显示了人民公社的优越性。
    今年，这个公社的小麦，经过去冬今春的加工管理，长得又密又高，比以往任何一年都好。过去，一个劳动力每天可以割四、五亩小麦，今年，一个劳动力只能割二亩左右。同样，过去一辆大车每天能拉五、六亩，今年每天只能拉一亩多。因此，今年的夏收工作量大大增加。如果按去年农业合作社各自夏收，仅收割运输两项工作，半个多月也完不成。但是，今年城关公社充分发挥了人多势众的威力，统一而且合理安排了夏收工作，组织了劳力畜力协作，在去年同样的时间内，就完成了比去年多两倍以上的收割、运输任务。
    今年4月间，这个公社就统一对夏收工作作了全面规划和具体安排。在小麦收割前，就提前完成了所有能在夏收前做完的农活，减少了麦收劳力畜力紧张的压力，使全社在小麦收割开始时就能全力以赴。
    夏收前，这个公社还充分发挥了社内工业交通、财政贸易和信用、文教卫生等部门的积极性，集中力量为夏收作准备。工业交通部门领导和帮助各队制造和修理了大批收割、运输等工具。社的信用部门依照各生产队的需要，发放了购买夏收工具的贷款九万元。社的中心商店按照与各管理区签订的合同，向外地购买、调换了大量的木杈、扫帚、苇席、麻绳等用具。社的仓库部门还在仓库工作做得最好的战烽生产队举办了仓库现场会议，训练了保管人员，准备了仓库。福利卫生等部门协助各队整顿了全社五百多个食堂和托儿所、幼儿园，并分别训练了一千二百五十多个炊事员、保育员、教养员、饲养员。此外，公社还统一解决了一些队在夏收期间的粮食、饲草和饲料问题。
    夏收开始后，这个公社在由生产队安排劳力畜力的基础上，根据小麦成熟迟早，统一调配力量，并按等价交换原则，发动各生产队互相支援，从而保证了夏收工作又快又好。除组织各生产队之间互相支援外，从5月31日到6月5日由公社统一组织互相支援的就有三千二百四十三人，大车一百二十辆，共收、运小麦二万二千二百三十亩，对于保证小麦全面适时收割，起了重大作用。在公社的统一领导下，各队实行了收割运输等工作的五项定额制（定人员、定地段、定时间、定数量、定质量），并规定超过定额的除加工分外，还付一部分现金奖励。这样，就充分地调动了全体社员的积极性，队与队、组与组、个人与个人展开了红旗竞赛，割麦效率普遍提高。
    城关公社还实行了五级连环包干（即公社包管理区、管理区包生产队、生产队包小队、小队包专业组、党团员包户），执行了干部五到田（即办公到田、劳动到田、检查到田、开会到田、吃饭到田），加强了对夏收的领导，鼓舞了群众的干劲。在突击割运中，还及时采取改进伙食花样等措施，使社员始终保持了充沛的精力和高度的劳动热情，保证了今年夏收的胜利完成。
    本报漯河12日电　河南郾城县空冢郭公社的农民，在夏收夏种中，充分利用公社的有利条件，快收快种，收得好，种得好，进一步显示了公社的巨大优越性。现在，这个公社的夏收夏种任务已经比往年提前十多天基本完成。
    由于支援工业和抢修水利，目前，这个公社参加农业生产的青壮年，比去年同期少了三千多人；但是，全公社投入夏收夏种的劳力却比去年大大增加。去年夏收时节操持家务的五千多个妇女，由于孩子进了托儿所和繁杂的炊事劳动被食堂代替了，今年就成了夏收夏种的生力军。公社中的工厂、学校、商店开展了大协作，也抽了三千多人支援抢收抢种。特别是公社劳动组织的不断改善，充分发挥了劳动潜力，工效不断提高，大大缓和了劳动力不足的紧张局面。全社各生产队夏收前普遍根据劳力强弱、技术专长，组织了收割、运输、打场、播种等七个专业队，实行了生产责任制。各个专业队和作业组还按照小段作业计划生产。据公社的统计：今年每人每日的割麦工效普遍由去年的一亩半提高到两亩，有不少队的运麦工效都提高了一倍，其他像犁地、播种和田间管理的生产效率，也都有不同程度的提高。
    今年，这个公社投入夏收夏种的畜力和工具也比去年大大增加，在三千二百多头耕畜中，公社化后增加的就有九百头左右，其中七百多头大耕畜是夏收以前买来的。公社的铁木工厂还生产了一天能割麦十多亩的鐥刀三百多张。夏收前夕，公社还拿出三万多元买回了两部大型动力脱粒机，这种脱粒机一天能脱粒四万斤。这种情况显示了公社的经济力量比过去大为雄厚。现在，这个公社存入银行的生产资金和公积金还有很多，仅公积金就有一万多元。
    空冢郭公社经过整社后，贯彻了统一领导分级管理的原则，夏收夏种工作安排得合情合理，群众抢收抢种的干劲，比过去任何一个时候都高。比质量、比进度、比多种、比工效的竞赛运动，开展得像春风烈火一般。公社人多力大，对群众的生活安排也更加周到。全社八十七个食堂在夏收夏种大忙中，普遍增加了饭菜花样，保证社员吃饱、吃好、吃省。公社的商业工作人员带货下田，医务工作人员到田头治病。由于食堂服务得好，疾病防治得好，今年全公社夏收夏种期间的出勤率达到百分之一百，比去年同期显著提高。
    现在，这个公社的三万多亩小麦已全部收割上场，大部已经脱粒。原计划在6月11日完成的晚秋作物的播种任务也提前在9日完成。夏收夏种的质量也比去年提高了。（附图片）
