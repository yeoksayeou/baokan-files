Xinhua News Agency, 31st - According to TASS reports, Bulgaria celebrates International Children's Day every year with new achievements in caring for mothers and educating the new generation.

In Bulgaria, mothers have a full four months of maternity leave: two months before birth and two months after birth. When the baby is under eight months old, the mother's workday is reduced by two hours, with full wages paid.

Previously, there were only three maternity hospitals in the whole country, and not all large city hospitals had obstetrics and gynecology departments. Now, there are about eight hundred maternity hospitals in rural areas alone.

During the years of the people's regime, the number of year-round and seasonal kindergartens, nurseries, and children's playgrounds increased from two hundred and fifty-four to six thousand five hundred; the number of pediatric departments in hospitals increased from four to one hundred and twenty-five; the number of children's sanatoriums increased from three to eleven; and six children's hospitals were also established.

Before liberation, more than 100,000 children could not attend school. The people's regime implemented a universal compulsory education system, providing free education for children, and hundreds of new schools were established. Bulgaria now ranks among the world's leading countries in terms of the number of people with secondary education per thousand inhabitants.

The people's regime attaches great importance to children's summer vacations and allocates large sums of money. The number of Young Pioneer camps is increasing year by year. This year, 200,000 primary school students will spend their holidays in Young Pioneer camps.

    保加利亚儿童深受关怀
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社报道，保加利亚每年都以对母亲的关怀和教育新的一代的新成就来庆祝国际儿童节。
    在保加利亚，母亲们有足足的四个月的产假：产前两个月，产后两个月。在婴孩不满八个月时，母亲的工作日缩减两小时，工资如数照发。
    以前，全国只有三个产妇院，城市的大医院也不是全都设有妇产科的。而现在，单在农村就约有八百个产妇院。
    在人民政权年代里，全年和季节性的幼儿园、托儿所和儿童游嬉场由二百五十四个增加到六千五百个，医院里的儿科从四个增加到一百二十五个，儿童疗养院从三个增加到十一个，并且还开办了六个儿童医院。
    解放前，有十多万儿童不能入学。人民政权实行了普及义务教育制，儿童免费受教育，并且新设了几百所学校。在按每一千人计算受过中等教育的人数方面，保加利亚现在居于世界前列地位。
    人民政权对儿童的夏季休养非常重视，并且拨出大笔资金。少先队营的数目逐年增加。今年将有二十万小学生去少先队营度假。
