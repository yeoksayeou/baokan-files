Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 20th, TASS dispatch: The foreign ministers attending the Geneva Conference decided today to adjourn the conference until July 13th.

The suggestion to adjourn was made by U.S. Secretary of State Herter on behalf of the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France at the second closed-door meeting of foreign ministers yesterday. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko said at that meeting that the Soviet delegation advocated continuing negotiations so that the conference could achieve positive results without interruption. However, it had to consider the wishes of Herter, Lloyd, and de Murville, who insisted on adjourning the conference. Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet delegation believed the adjournment period should be as short as possible.

Today, the foreign ministers held a brief plenary session. Gromyko, who was chairing the meeting, said that after an exchange of views among the participants, an agreement was reached on adjourning the conference until July 13th. The next meeting will be held at 3:30 PM on July 13th.

The conference then adopted a communiqué on the adjournment. The communiqué stated, "The participants in the Foreign Ministers' Conference have extensively exchanged views on the issues under discussion in Geneva since May 11th. The ministers believe that further discussions and negotiations are necessary. They have decided to suspend the work of the conference and resume it in Geneva on July 13th, 1959."

Finally, Gromyko, on behalf of the conference participants, expressed gratitude to the Swiss government and the Geneva authorities for their assistance to the conference to the best of their ability. Gromyko also praised the work of the technical staff and then announced the adjournment of the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, June 20th, TASS dispatch from Geneva: The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held two informal meetings on the 19th. A communiqué was issued after the second informal meeting. The communiqué stated that the foreign ministers agreed to hold a plenary session at 11:00 AM local time on June 20th.

    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：出席日内瓦会议的外长们今天决定会议休会，休会期限到7月13日为止。
    休会的建议是美国国务卿赫脱代表美、英、法三国代表团在昨天的外交部长第二次秘密会议上提出的。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在那个会议上说，苏联代表团主张继续进行谈判，使会议在不中断的情况下取得积极结果，但它不能不考虑赫脱、劳埃德和德姆维尔的愿望，他们坚持会议休会。葛罗米柯强调说，苏联代表团认为，休会的期限应当尽可能地短。
    今天外长们举行了简短的全体会议，担任主席的葛罗米柯说，在会议参加者交换意见后达成了关于会议休会的协议，休会期限将到7月13日为止。下次会议在7月13日十五时三十分举行。
    会议接着通过了关于会议休会的公报。公报说，“外长会议参加者从5月11日起在日内瓦就所讨论的问题广泛交换了意见。部长们认为进行新的讨论和谈判是必要的。他们决定中断会议的工作，到1959年7月13日再在日内瓦恢复工作。”
    葛罗米柯最后代表会议参加者对瑞士政府和日内瓦当局表示感谢，感谢它们在能力所及的范围内给予会议的帮助。葛罗米柯还赞扬了技术人员的工作，并接着宣布会议休会。
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联、美国、英国和法国四国外长19日举行了两次非正式会议。第二次非正式会议后发表了公报。公报说，外长们商定，6月20日当地时间十一时将举行全体会议。
