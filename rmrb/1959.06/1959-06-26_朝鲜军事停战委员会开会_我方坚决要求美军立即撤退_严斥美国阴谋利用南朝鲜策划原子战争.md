Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th: A meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission was held today at Panmunjom at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side.

    At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun, chief commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, strongly demanded that the U.S. military immediately withdraw from South Korea.

    Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that nine years ago today, the American aggressors launched a barbaric war of aggression against Korea,妄想 hoping to conquer Korea, but ultimately ended in a shameful and disastrous defeat.

    Major General Zhu Changjun said that the Korean armistice has been in effect for nearly six years, but no progress has been made on what the Korean Armistice Agreement requires. Peace in Korea is still threatened, and South and North Korea are still separated by the military demarcation line. Parents, wives, relatives, and friends in South and North Korea cannot visit each other, and cannot even exchange messages. This national suffering of the Korean people is entirely caused by the U.S. imperialists who forcibly occupy South Korea.

    After describing the tragic situation of the South Korean people, Major General Zhu Changjun said: "The only way to eliminate this national misfortune and suffering of the Korean people is to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea at an early date in accordance with the explicit provisions of the Armistice Agreement." He said: "The Korean-Chinese side has consistently made every possible effort to realize the requirements and purposes of the Armistice Agreement."

    Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out: "The U.S. aggressive clique does not care at all about the mission entrusted to them by the Armistice Agreement. Not only are they not prepared to withdraw troops from South Korea, but they continue to plot a long-term occupation of South Korea. They respond to the proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of the motherland with actions that systematically undermine the Armistice Agreement and blatantly carry out war preparations."

    Major General Zhu Changjun then pointed out the U.S.'s behavior of expanding the Li pseudo-army and transporting atomic weapons into South Korea, which has exacerbated the tension in Korea. He pointed out that today South Korea is becoming an outpost for U.S. imperialism's atomic warfare. "All these actions of the U.S. aggressors seriously violate the Armistice Agreement and seriously threaten the peace and security of Korea, the Far East, and the world."

    Major General Zhu Changjun emphasized: "For the peace of Korea and the Far East, for the early reunification of Korea, and for relieving the suffering of the South Korean people, the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression against South Korea must be stopped, the U.S. imperialists' occupation system in South Korea must be abolished, and the U.S. military must immediately withdraw from South Korea."

    The U.S. representative dared not directly answer the stern condemnation and just demands of the Korean-Chinese side, but slandered the Korean-Chinese side as engaging in "propaganda" and falsely accused the Korean-Chinese side of launching the Korean War.

    Major General Zhu Changjun immediately presented at the meeting the documents and evidence of the U.S.-Li agreement to jointly launch the Korean War, which were seized by the Korean People's Army when it liberated Seoul on June 28, 1950, and sternly refuted the U.S.'s absurd arguments that reversed black and white.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会开会
    我方坚决要求美军立即撤退
    严斥美国阴谋利用南朝鲜策划原子战争
    新华社平壤25日电　板门店消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会今天在朝中方面建议下举行会议。
    朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在会上强硬要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜。
    朱昌骏少将指出，九年前的今天，美国侵略者发动了野蛮的侵朝战争，妄想征服朝鲜，但最后以遭到可耻的惨败而告终。
    朱昌骏少将说，朝鲜停战已经将近六年了，但朝鲜停战协定要求作的事情还没有取得任何进展。朝鲜的和平仍然受到威胁，南、北朝鲜仍被军事分界线隔绝，南北朝鲜的父母妻子和亲戚朋友互相不能来往，甚至不能互通音信。朝鲜人民的这种民族痛苦，完全是用武力侵占南朝鲜的美帝国主义者所造成的。
    朱昌骏少将在叙述了南朝鲜人民的悲惨处境后说：“要消除朝鲜人民的这种民族不幸和痛苦的唯一途径，就是按照停战协定的明文规定，早日实现朝鲜的和平统一。”他说：“朝中方面为了实现停战协定的要求和目的，一贯作着一切可能的努力。”
    朱昌骏少将指出：“美国侵略集团丝毫不关心停战协定赋予他们的使命，他们不仅不准备从南朝鲜撤走军队，反而继续策划长期占领南朝鲜。对于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出的关于和平统一祖国的建议，他们以系统地破坏停战协定、露骨地进行战争准备的行动来回答。”
    朱昌骏少将接着指出了美国扩充李伪军，把原子武器运进南朝鲜等加剧朝鲜紧张局势的行为。他指出，今天南朝鲜正在变为美帝国主义的原子战争的前哨基地。“美国侵略者的这一切行为严重地破坏了停战协定，同时严重地威胁着朝鲜、远东和世界的和平和安全。”
    朱昌骏少将强调说：“为了朝鲜和远东的和平，为了朝鲜的早日统一，为了解除南朝鲜人民遭受的痛苦，美帝国主义者对南朝鲜的侵略政策必须停止，美帝国主义者对南朝鲜的占领制度必须废除，美军必须立即撤出南朝鲜。”
    美方代表不敢正面回答朝中方面的严正谴责和正义主张，却诬蔑朝中方面是进行“宣传”，并诬蔑朝鲜战争是朝中方面发动的。
    朱昌骏少将在会上当场拿出了朝鲜人民军在1950年6月28日解放汉城时所缴获的美李协议共同发动朝鲜战争的文件和证据，并严词驳斥了美方的颠倒黑白的谬论。
