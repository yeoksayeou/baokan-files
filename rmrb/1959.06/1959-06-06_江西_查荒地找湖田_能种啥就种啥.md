Jiangxi: Investigate Wasteland, Seek Lakeside Fields, Plant Whatever Can Be Planted

(Our newspaper Nanchang dispatch, 5th) Jiangxi Province is making every effort to expand the summer planting area and increase total grain output. As of now, Jiangxi Province has harvested more than 3 million mu of rapeseed fields and more than 1 million mu of wheat and barley fields, and has already planted more than 3.4 million mu of single-season late rice and 500,000 mu of sweet potatoes. Now, various places are reclaiming lakeside fields and wasteland, fighting in the fields to further expand the summer planting area.

Because the summer harvesting work has basically ended in various places, the leadership's efforts have shifted to summer grain purchase and summer planting. In particular, for the wheat and rapeseed fields that have been vacated, the method of "planting after harvesting, regardless of the size of the plot" is adopted to rush the cultivation and planting, so that field operations such as harvesting, plowing and harrowing, fertilizing, irrigating, transplanting seedlings, and sowing are carried out in a synchronized manner. Therefore, all rapeseed fields and a part of the wheat fields have quickly "shed their yellow robes and put on green jackets," turning morning wheat into evening rice.

In the summer planting, various places, in conjunction with the early rice production appraisal and major inspection, conducted a comprehensive inspection of abandoned fields and lakeside fields and mountainside fields that could be cultivated. According to incomplete statistics from Ganzhou, Yichun, Shangrao, Ji'an and other administrative regions and special districts alone, more than 2.4 million mu of wasteland and fields that could be planted but were not planted have been found. Now, these fields are planted with single-season late rice and sweet potatoes, beans, oil crops, vegetables, and miscellaneous grains according to the principle of planting whatever can be planted. In Yichun, Jiujiang, Shangrao and other places around Poyang Lake, in addition to cultivating abandoned land, nearly 2 million mu of sesame, sorghum and rice have been sown by using the gaps of lake water rising and falling, based on local experience in planting lakeside fields. In the expansion movement, various places emphasized putting the public first and the private second. Under the premise of managing the crops planted by the collective well, commune members used their spare time to manage small plots and scattered plots well. This has solved some cadres' and masses' ideological concerns about expanding planting.

### 江西  查荒地找湖田  能种啥就种啥

    江西  查荒地找湖田  能种啥就种啥
    本报南昌5日电  江西省千方百计扩大夏种面积，增加粮食总产量。截至目前止，江西全省已收割完的三百多万亩油菜田和一百多万亩大小麦田里，已种下了三百四十多万亩一季晚稻和五十万亩红薯。现在各地正开垦湖田、荒地，为进一步扩大夏季播种面积奋战田间。
    各地由于夏收工作基本结束，领导力量已转入夏粮征购和夏种等工作。特别对已腾出的麦田和油菜田，都采取了“块大块小收完种了”的抢耕抢种方法，使收割、耕耙、施肥、灌水、插秧、播种等田间操作穿花进行。因而全部油菜田和一部分小麦田都迅速地“脱黄袍穿绿袄”，变朝麦为夕稻。
    各地在夏种中，结合早稻生产评比大检查，对撩荒田和可以耕种的湖滨田、山边田，进行了全面检查。现仅赣南、宜春、上饶、吉安等行政区和专区的不完全统计，即已查出有二百四十多万亩荒田和能种而未种的田。现在这些田都根据能种什么就种什么的原则，种上了一季晚稻和红薯、豆类、油料作物、蔬菜和杂粮。在鄱阳湖四周的宜春、九江、上饶各地，除耕种了抛荒地以外，还根据当地种湖田的经验，利用湖水涨落的空隙，播种了近二百万亩芝麻、高粱和水稻。在扩种运动中，各地强调了先公后私，在管理好集体种的农作物前提下，社员利用空余时间经营好小块田、零星田。这样就解决了部分干群对扩种的思想顾虑。
