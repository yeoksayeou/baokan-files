Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th: The wheat harvesting work in Hebei Province, after more than 5.9 million commune members' over twenty days of intense labor, and overcoming wind, rain, and hail, is now basically completed.

The province's wheat harvest was carried out in continuous overcast and rainy weather. On June 7th, some areas were also hit by gale-force winds and hail. Under the slogan of "Seizing grain from the dragon's mouth, racing against time, preventing rot in the rain, and ensuring every grain goes into the granary," people everywhere carried and drove animals, braving the rain to rush to harvest and thresh. Kitchen stoves, beds, and windmills served as the sun, and corridors, dining rooms, and classrooms became threshing grounds. Regardless of wind or rain, threshing, rubbing, winnowing, and sieving continued without stopping. In Shexian County, communes set up more than 2,600 indoor threshing sites and 9,700 warehouses for drying wheat, preventing sprouting and mold. The 280,000+ mu of wheat damaged by hail in counties such as Jixian, Baodi, and Tangshan were mostly recovered by commune members who swept up the grains in the fields.

While forming professional teams for harvesting and threshing wheat, various localities also organized specialized teams to pick up dropped wheat, mainly composed of elderly commune members, children, and other auxiliary labor, to pick up as they went. According to preliminary statistics from the three special districts of Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding, as well as Jixian and Baodi counties, a total of 45.38 million catties of wheat have been picked up and swept back.

During the intense wheat harvest, the superiority of the people's communes, combining workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, was greatly demonstrated. Workers and staff of factories and enterprises and teachers and students of schools under the leadership of the communes made prior arrangements for their work and plunged into the battle of wheat harvest. Some service industries, such as hairdressing and supply and marketing departments, also participated in wheat harvesting while serving the commune members. Some communes also helped each production team sign support contracts based on the principles of voluntariness and equal exchange to support each other, greatly speeding up the progress of wheat harvesting. Many local Party and government leaders from the county to the production team went deep into the fields to work alongside the commune members, ensuring timely detection and resolution of problems.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th: The vast majority of Shandong Province's 16 million-strong wheat harvesting army has switched to threshing in the fields and launching a concentrated summer planting effort. With the exception of the eastern coastal areas, which are still rushing to harvest late-maturing wheat, the wheat in other parts of the province has been basically reaped.

In order to prevent wind and rain attacks, people's communes in various parts of Shandong Province have expanded their threshing grounds and adopted various methods to accelerate threshing. Guanxian, Licheng, Laiwu, and other counties with faster wheat harvesting progress have built more than 2,700 threshing grounds on the spot in concentrated wheat areas and wheat fields far from villages, reducing transportation volume and speeding up threshing. After the Chengguan People's Commune in Guanxian built threshing grounds on the spot, the commune's daily threshing progress increased from about 4,000 mu to more than 12,000 mu. Farmers in Liaocheng and Zibo special districts and suburban counties of Jinan City have adopted methods such as threshing in the fields on sunny days and threshing indoors on overcast and rainy days; many communes have also changed the method of threshing the entire wheat stalk in previous years to threshing only the wheat ears, increasing the threshing efficiency by one to two times.

Under the slogan of "Every grain goes into the granary," various localities have paid attention to organizing the elderly and children to follow behind the reapers to pick up dropped ears of wheat from the very beginning of the wheat harvest. The four counties (cities) of Licheng, Changqing, Tai'an, and Laiwu in the suburbs of Jinan City have organized a total of more than 100,000 people to pick up wheat, ensuring that they pick up as they harvest, averaging more than 200,000 catties of wheat picked up every day.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The wheat in the suburbs of Beijing has been basically harvested. While threshing, weighing, purchasing, and transporting at the same time, the communes are actively organizing re-harvesting and re-threshing to achieve a bumper harvest.

Due to the recent intermittent rain and sunshine, and the rush to harvest, some places in the suburbs did not strictly ensure that the harvest was clean, the picking was clean, and the threshing was clean. There were still dropped ears in the fields, and there were still wheat grains in the threshed wheat straw. Therefore, after careful arrangements, each commune and production team has drawn a group of commune members and students on wheat vacation to re-thresh and re-harvest, and has achieved great results.

### 河北山东麦收基本结束  北京郊区组织力量复收复打

    河北山东麦收基本结束
    北京郊区组织力量复收复打
    据新华社天津20日电　河北省的小麦收割工作，经过五百九十多万社员二十多天的紧张劳动，战胜了风雨冰雹，现在已经基本结束。
    全省麦收工作是在连绵阴雨中进行的。6月7日，部分地区还受到了七级大风和冰雹的袭击。在“龙口夺粮，争时争晌，阴雨不烂，颗粒归仓”的口号下，各地都是人背畜驮，冒雨抢收抢打。锅台、炕头、风车当太阳，走廊、饭厅、课堂变成打麦场，不管刮风下雨，摔、搓、搧、簸，打麦不停。涉县各公社雨天在室内打场的有二千六百多处，晾麦的仓库有九千七百多间，防止了小麦的发芽、霉烂。蓟县、宝坻、唐山市等地被雹打坏的二十八万多亩小麦，经社员们到麦田里扫麦粒，也大部分已经收回。
    各地在组成收打小麦专业队的同时，也组织以老年社员、儿童等辅助劳力为主的拾麦专业队，随割随拾。据邯郸、石家庄、保定三个专区及蓟县、宝坻两个县的初步统计，共已拾回、扫回小麦四千五百三十八万多斤。
    在紧张的麦收中，工农兵学商相结合的人民公社大大显示了优越性。公社领导下的工厂企业职工、学校师生都把自己的业务事先作好安排，投入了麦收战斗。有些服务性行业，如理发业、供销部门等人员，也是一面参加收麦，一面为社员服务。有些公社还帮助各生产队之间按自愿和等价交换原则，签订支援合同，互相支援，大大加快了麦收进度。许多地方从县到生产队的党政领导干部都深入田间，同社员一起劳动，做到及时发现问题，及时解决。
    据新华社济南20日电　山东省一千六百万麦收大军绝大部分已转到场间脱粒和突击夏种。现在除东部沿海地区正在抢收晚熟小麦以外，全省其他地区的小麦已经基本割完。
    为了防止风雨袭击，山东各地人民公社纷纷扩大场基，采取各种办法突击打场。麦收进度较快的冠县、历城、莱芜等县，在麦田集中区和离村较远的麦田里就地建场二千七百多处，减少了运输量，加快了脱粒速度。冠县城关人民公社就地建场以后，全社每天的脱粒进度由原来的四千亩左右增加到一万二千多亩。聊城、淄博等专区和济南市郊各县的农民，采取晴天场间打轧，阴雨天屋内摔搓等办法突击脱粒；许多公社还将往年打轧整个麦棵的办法改变为铡穗打轧，使脱粒效率提高一倍到两倍。
    在“颗粒归仓”的口号下，各地从收麦一开始，就注意组织老年人和少年儿童等专门跟镰拾麦。济南市郊的历城、长清、泰安、莱芜四个县（市），共组织十万多人拾麦，做到随收随拾，平均每天拾麦二十多万斤。
    据新华社20日讯　北京郊区小麦已经基本收割完毕，各公社在边打边秤边购边运的同时，正在积极组织复收复打，做到丰产丰收。
    由于近日时雨时晴，突击抢收，郊区有些地方没有严格做到收净、拣净、打净，地里仍有丢穗，打过的麦秸里还有麦粒，因此各公社、生产队经过细致安排，都抽出一批社员和放麦假的学生复打复收，获得很大的成绩。
