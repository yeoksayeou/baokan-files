    Cuban Landlords in Pinar del Río Province Resist Land Reform
    Castro to Go to the Land Reform Frontlines to Supervise the Battle
    HAVANA (Pinar del Río) - The Cuban government announced here on the evening of the 8th that Prime Minister Castro would go to Pinar del Río Province to implement the land reform plan. He is scheduled to stay there for ten days.

    It is reported that the large estate owners in Pinar del Río Province, and the small landlords incited by them, have launched a large-scale movement against the land reform law. They have held conferences and sent delegations to the capital, Havana, to demand that the government revise the land reform law. These landlords have openly threatened to go to the mountains to launch a rebellion, if necessary, to defend their private property.

    The conspiracy of the landlords in Pinar del Río Province to oppose land reform has been met with a strong counterattack by the Cuban people. Workers, peasants, soldiers, and students from all over the country have held activities and parades to support the government and land reform, and have widely launched a campaign to donate agricultural machinery to support land reform. Ateaga, a senior civilian official of the army in Pinar del Río Province, directly responded to the landlords' provocations in a radio broadcast, saying, "If the landlords go to the mountains, it will not be the revolutionary court that shoots them to death, but the peasants themselves."

    It is reported that Castro visited Pinar del Río on June 1 and assured the farm workers at a meeting that the government would implement its land reform plan. The day before the government announced that he would go to Pinar del Río Province to personally lead the land reform in the province, Castro reiterated his government's determination to carry out the land reform plan to the end in a speech at a press luncheon commemorating Freedom of the Press Day. He said, "Even if railroad spikes fall from the sky," he would carry out his plan, and he also said that Cuba's land reform plan "may be the most important battle in the revolution."

    古巴比那尔德里奥省地主抗拒土改
    卡斯特罗将赴土改前线督战
    本报讯　比那尔德里奥消息：古巴政府8日晚在这里宣布，卡斯特罗总理将前往比那尔德里奥省，贯彻土地改革计划的实施。他预定在那里逗留十天。
    据报道，比那尔德里奥省的大庄园主和在他们煽动下的小地主，发动了一个规模庞大的反对土地改革法的运动。他们曾经举行大会，派代表团到首都哈瓦那要求政府修改土地改革法。这些地主们公开威胁说，在必要时他们将到山上发动叛乱，以保卫他们的私有财产。
    比那尔德里奥省地主们反对土地改革的阴谋活动，遭到古巴人民的有力反击。全国各地的工人、农民、战士和学生纷纷举行支持政府和土地改革的活动和游行，并且广泛开展捐献农业机器支持土地改革的运动。比那尔德里奥省的高级陆军文官阿特亚加在电台广播中直接答复了地主们的挑衅，他说，“如果地主到山上去的话，开枪打死他们的将不是革命法庭，而是农民们自己。”
    据报道，卡斯特罗曾在6月1日前往比那尔德里奥视察，他在农场工人的会议上保证说，政府将贯彻它的土地改革计划。在政府宣布他将赴比那尔德里奥省亲自领导这个省的土地改革的前一天，卡斯特罗在纪念新闻自由日的一次记者午宴会上发表的讲话，再度表示了他的政府要把土地改革计划贯彻到底的决心。他说，“即使天上落下铁道钉来”，他也要执行他的计划，他并且说，古巴的土地改革计划，“可能是革命中最重要的一场战役”。
