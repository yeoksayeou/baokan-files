Beautiful City Has Many Heroes
By our correspondent Zhang Jianhong

Luoyang, this ancient capital, beautiful and weathered, has now, thanks to the construction efforts of the working people, shed its former haggard appearance and become a blossoming peony flower on the motherland's soil, radiant and full of youthful vigor. At dawn, when the graceful peaks of the Longmen Mountains appear in the distance as light ink silhouettes, the entire city bursts into life, and in the industrial zone, spanning over ten kilometers, crowds surge and songs resonate. The three major factories, emblazoned with the golden characters "First Tractor Manufacturing Plant," "Luoyang Bearing Factory," and "Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant," sound their cheerful whistles in unison, welcoming each of their workers arriving for the early shift. Trains speeding along the factory's dedicated lines delivered steel here last night, and today they are transporting machinery for mining, coal washing and coking, steel rolling, and farmland irrigation to all corners of the country. The Luoyang Power Plant, towering in the central area north of the factory district, boasting powerful electrical and heating capabilities, emits wisps of light smoke that slowly dissipate into the clear sky... The scenery here becomes even more charming in the evening. The people who have been working hard in the workshops and construction sites all day are now strolling in twos and threes along every tree-lined avenue adorned with lush greenery, breathing in the refreshing fragrance of locust flowers. The lights that rise with the twilight, like stars scattered throughout the night, form a dazzling screen of pearls along the streets. Looking southeast from Jianxi, the Zhongzhou Bridge and Luoyang Bridge, spanning the Jian and Luo rivers, appear like rainbows suspended in the vast night. Luoyang, this sleepless city, hears its frequent pulse at all times—the rumble of vehicles on the transportation arteries, the roar of machines from various factories—they bid farewell to the night and welcome the dawn. As the pages of the calendar are turned day by day with such rapid changes, Luoyang has completely and forever shed its poverty and backwardness from the era of reactionary rule.

The ancient Luoyang is young again. The myriad changes that have taken place in just four years are the crystallization of the construction army's dedication, selfless labor, and wisdom. From the day construction of this city began, the construction heroes began to undergo glorious and severe trials. The cold wind carrying snow particles pierced their hands and faces, the scorching sun baked them dizzy and cracked their skin, raindrops of sweat seeped into every inch of soil here, their shoulders were rubbed raw in the heavy earthwork projects, and blisters the size of beans rose on their palms... However, their project indicators are constantly soaring, and they are completing each of the country's grand construction projects ahead of schedule, year after year. They build this factory and then that factory, moving from one victory to a new one. They have built the motherland, and the motherland nurtures them. They have grown rapidly with the birth of the new city.

Growing with the Industrial City

Today, Wang Dalong, a mason with a reputation as an advanced producer on the construction site of the non-ferrous metal processing plant, is one of millions of heroes. Almost every factory above and below ground here bears the imprint of his footsteps. He climbed dozens of meters high to build chimneys that pierce the sky, and he also built retaining walls for various power pipelines several meters underground. When people's breath turned to ice and their hands were too frozen to move, he created amazing miracles on the ice-covered wilderness, completing the urgent national engineering tasks with over seven or eight times the quota. Recently, he won again at the basic construction site of Luoyang City with a brilliant achievement four times greater than before. People call him a red flag. Whenever this honor is mentioned, a very gentle smile always crosses his weathered face with middle-aged wrinkles, and then he says seriously: "What's so great about me? All the achievements are everyone's! A craftsman learns until old age, and I still need to work harder." Isn't this extraordinary spirit hidden within his approachable exterior the most beautiful source of his often ingenious success in construction? He has been a glorious Communist Party member for three years now. Any grand bricklaying project here is a step for him to improve his skills. He and his assistants and apprentices have become very proficient in using mortar spreaders, bricklaying machines, etc., to replace manual operations. In the days when he led his partners in every construction battle, he always took the lead in enduring hardship. Once, after a snowy night, the bricklaying project encountered great difficulties. The bricks soaked in water became ice blocks as soon as they were picked up, and the mortar froze as soon as it was exposed to the wind. The young men's fingers were red, swollen, and numb from the cold wind, and they could not control them. However, the engineering task of the tractor factory was urgent and imminent. What should be done? At this time, Wang Dalong suddenly had an idea, shouted, and everyone followed him from the open-air exterior wall to the top with the roof to build the interior wall. At the same time, he found some waste straw and wood chips and lit a big fire on the ground to let his partners warm up while working. He himself was like being glued to the scaffolding, working all night, and finally enabled the entire team to overfulfill the task while ensuring quality. The young men all said that they could learn a complete set of skills from him. He not only taught them how to use mechanical bricklaying, but also personally demonstrated to them how to pick up a brick and what posture to use to pass it most appropriately. In recent years, his journey from a mid-level technician to a senior technician, from a leader of a twelve-person masonry team to a leader of a one-hundred-thirty-person mixed engineering team, is a testament to his continuous leap forward on the road of life. His lovely apprentices are now also experts and mainstays on the construction front. The clever young man Jin Meixing is still an advanced producer in the same work area as him. In fact, there are not a few people like Wang Dalong in Luoyang.

To Make Beautiful Luoyang Even More Beautiful

Like many visitors to Luoyang, while visiting the magnificent construction projects, we also love to extend our vision to the front of the production line. Heroes are also emerging here, and miracles are like pearls on an endless string. Gu Rongfu, a young lathe operator who manufactures mining machinery, has innovated seventeen technologies from May of last year to now, completed 13,500 working hours in eleven months, and began working on the 1964 tasks in April. After Yao Changyou, the founder of the national new record of one thousand units per shift, appeared among the workers of the tractor manufacturing plant, Zhang Bohu, Cui Shilong, and Yuan Ziming, the creators of the monthly output of six thousand four hundred working hours, appeared. Twenty-three-year-old Fu Guangyao, when he first entered the factory, saw those gray-green and shiny machines in the workshop, and his heart beat so fast that he felt that these big guys would hit his nose or press down on his head at any time. He was flustered and felt that his small body was even smaller and more insignificant. But this spring, half a year later, his deeds of cutting off the "appendix" of the tractor to simplify the product structure won applause and applause from everyone at the city's congress of activists in socialist construction! People praised him for boldly "dismissing" the refueling pipe on the fifty-four horsepower "Dongfanghong" tractor and replacing the complicated processing part with a very simple white iron spout funnel, saving man-hours and cast iron. He also advocated standardizing the two wheel covers on the drag chain wheel and the drive wheel, saving labor and improving processing efficiency several times. Hearing the bursts of applause at the meeting, his face turned red, not only because of the shyness of the young man, but also because of the excitement in his heart! He thought that although he was born and raised in Luoyang, he had not loved Luoyang very much for a long time in the past. When he was eleven or twelve years old, he learned to weave socks in the old city for two years, but in fact, he stood next to the master and did odd jobs for two years. The boss would not let him touch the machine even with one finger. But now, as soon as he entered the tractor factory, Master Maliyao assigned him a brand-new drilling machine, and in a very short time, taught him the skills of turning, planing, scribing, etc. without reservation. When he accidentally broke the drill bit while driving, he was jumping up and down in his heart, but Master Ma did not scold him, but comforted him softly and explained the reason for the accident. He clearly realized that his achievements came from his master and were also given to him by the new Luoyang! He has an incomparably deep love for this glorious hometown, which was the first to send a large number of tractors to farmers across the country.

Production and construction are two lines, and heroes emerge on every line, which is a true reflection of today's Luoyang.

Luoyang, this ancient city, once nurtured ancient national culture and nurtured millions of heroes of the era today. May the achievements of the heroes shine with the ever-young and beautiful appearance of the city at the same time. (Attached picture)

    美丽的城市英雄多
    本报记者　张健虹
    洛阳，这个历尽沧桑的美丽的古都，如今在劳动人民的建设中，已一改往昔的憔悴容颜，成为祖国大地上一朵盛开的牡丹，它绚烂多彩，处处闪射着青春的光芒。清晨，当挺秀的龙门山峰，在天边映现出淡墨色的身影时，整个城市便欢腾了起来，在方圆十数公里的工业区里，人潮汹涌，歌声回荡。那嵌有“第一拖拉机制造厂”、“洛阳轴承厂”、“洛阳矿山机器厂”等金色字样的三大工厂，一齐响着愉快的汽笛，接待它们每一个来上早班的生产者。疾驰在工厂专用线上的列车，昨夜把钢铁运到这里，今朝又从这里把采矿、洗煤炼焦、轧钢和农田排灌用的机器运往四面八方。雄踞在厂区北面中央地带的、拥有强大电、热功能的洛阳电厂，轻烟袅袅，慢慢在晴空中散开……。每到傍晚，这里的景色就更加显得妩媚动人。在车间和工地紧张忙碌了一天的人们，此刻都三三两两地漫步在绿树盛装的每一条林荫道上，呼吸着沁人肺腑的槐花的清香，而与那暮色同时升起的满城灯火，就像黑夜里撒落在四处的星辰，组成了面临大街的一道道镶满明珠的屏障。从涧西向东南方眺望，屹立在涧、洛两河上面的中州桥、洛阳桥，如同高悬空际的彩虹，出现在茫茫的夜色之中。洛阳，这个不眠的城市，人们时刻都在听到它频频的脉搏，那滚动在交通要道上的??车声，那来自各个工厂里的机器的轰鸣，它们送走了黑夜，又迎接了黎明。就在这样日新月异地掀开一页页日历的时候，洛阳，彻底地永远地摆脱了它在反动统治年代里的贫穷落后的命运。
    古老的洛阳年轻了。它在仅仅四年中发生了如此万花缭乱的巨变，这是建设大军克服困难、忘我的劳动和智慧的结晶。从开始兴建这个城市那一天起，建设英雄们就开始经历着光荣而严重的考验。夹带着雪粒的寒风，扎破了他们的手脸，毒热的骄阳烘烤得他们头晕皮裂，雨滴般的汗珠渗进了这里的每一方泥土，在沉重的土方工程中，他们的肩头磨肿了，手掌上隆起了豆大的血泡……，但是，他们的样样工程指标都在不断地飞升，并且成年成季地提前完成着国家每一项宏伟的工程建设。他们建完了这厂又建那厂，从一个胜利又走向一个新的胜利，他们建设了祖国，祖国抚育了他们，他们随着新城市的诞生而迅速地成长了起来。
    同工业城市一起成长
    今天在有色金属加工厂建筑工地上享有先进生产者盛名的泥工王大龙，就是千百万英雄中间的一个。几乎这儿的每一座工厂的地上地下都刻印着他的足迹。他爬在数十公尺的高空，用砖砌过插入云霄的烟囱，也在好几公尺的地底下，砌过各种动力管道的护壁，而当人们“哈气成冰”、冻得伸不出手的时候，他却在复盖着冰层的旷野上创造着惊人的奇迹，以超额七、八倍的数字，完成了国家的紧急工程任务，最近他又以四倍于以往成就的辉煌战果，取胜于洛阳市的基本建设工地。人们管他叫一面红旗。一提起这种荣誉，他那张饱经风霜的有着中年人绉纹的脸上，总要掠过一个非常温和的微笑，然后严肃地说：“我有什么了不起呢，所有的成绩都是大家的！手艺行是做到老学到老，我还要加把劲才行哩。”这深藏在他平易近人的外表里面的非凡的心灵，不正是他在施工中往往能够出奇制胜的最美好的泉源吗？他已经在三年前从一个群众变成了一个光荣的共产党员。这里任何一项砖砌的浩大工程，都是他提高技术的阶梯，他和他的助手们、徒弟们已经非常熟练地运用铺灰机、砌墙机等等，来代替当年的手工操作。他在带领伙伴们进行每一个施工战役的日子里，自己总是吃苦在先。有一回，在一夜风雪之后，砌墙工程发生了很大的困难，浸了水的砖拈上手就成了冰块，砂浆见风就冻了起来，小伙子们的手指头都被冷风吹得又红又肿，木梆梆地不受自己使唤，而拖拉机厂的工程任务却又紧急得刻不容缓。怎么办呢？这时王大龙一时计上心来，吆喝了一声，大伙都由露天砌外墙的地方跟他跑到支起了房顶的顶下去砌里墙，同时找了些废草木片，在地上燃起一大堆火来，让伙伴们一边取暖，一边工作，他自己却像粘在脚手架上一样，一直干了个通宵，终于使整个小组在保证质量的前提下，超额完成了任务。小伙子们都说跟他学技术，可以落落实实地学到全套本领。他教他们如何使用机械砌墙还不算，连一块砖怎么拿上手、用什么姿势去传递最适宜，他都要亲自做给他们看。这几年他由一个中级技工到高级技工，一个领导十二人的泥工小组长到领导一百三十人混合工程队长的里程，正是他在生活的道路上不断飞跃的见证。他的可爱的徒弟们呢，现在也都是施工战线上的能手和主力军。那个机灵的小伙子金梅星还是和他同在一个工区的先进生产者哩。其实，在洛阳像王大龙这样的人，是不在少数的。
    要让美丽的洛阳更美
    我们也同许多过往洛阳的参观者一样，在观光访问了规模宏伟的建设工程的同时，爱把视线伸向生产战线的前方。这儿也是英雄辈出，奇迹也像永不断线的珍珠。制造矿山机器的青年车工顾荣福，从去年5月到现在，革新技术十七项，在十一个月中完成一万三千五百个工时，4月里就开始干1964年的活儿。在拖拉机制造厂工人中出现了全国千台时新纪录的创始者姚长有之后，又出现了台月产量达到六千四百工时的创造者张伯虎、崔士龙、袁子明。二十三岁的符光尧，在刚刚走进工厂的时候，他看到车间里那些灰绿色的、乌亮亮的机器，心跳得不行，老觉得这些大家伙不知什么时候就要撞到自己的鼻子上，或是要从自己的头上压了下来，他心慌意乱，感到自己矮小的身子更加渺小和微不足道了。但是半年以后的这个春天，他割掉拖拉机“盲肠”简化产品结构的事迹，却在全市社会主义建设积极分子代表会上博得了众人的喝采和鼓掌！人们赞许他的是：他大胆地“开除”了五十四马力“东方红”拖拉机上的加油管，而用一个非常简易的白铁皮歪咀漏斗来代替这个加工程序复杂的零件的用途，省工时也省了铸铁。他还主张把拖链轮和驱动轮上的两个轮盖标准化，节约人工又提高加工效率好几倍。他听到会上的阵阵掌声，满脸发红，这不仅是由于青年人的害臊，而且是由于心头的激动！他想到自己虽在洛阳土生土长，但过去很长时期内并不很爱洛阳，十一、二岁的时候到老城里学织袜子学了两年，实际上是站在师傅旁边一边干杂活，一边看了两年，老板对于他，连一个手指头也不让他碰一下机器。但是现在他一进拖拉机厂，马里耀师傅就分配他一部崭新的钻床，在很短的时间内，把车、钳、划线等等技能毫不保留地教会了他，当他开车时不小心打断了钻头，心里乱蹦乱跳的当儿，马师傅没有叱责，反而轻言细语安慰他，给他讲清了出事故的道理。他清楚地意识到自己的成绩是从师傅那里得来的，也是新的洛阳给他的！他对这个第一批给全国农民送去大批拖拉机的光荣的故乡有着无比深切的热爱。
    生产、建设两条线，条条线上出英雄，恰是今日洛阳的真实写照。
    洛阳，这个古代的名城，它曾经孕育了古国文化，又抚育了今天的千百万个时代的英雄。愿英雄们的业绩与城市的永远年轻美丽的容貌，同时增辉。（附图片）
