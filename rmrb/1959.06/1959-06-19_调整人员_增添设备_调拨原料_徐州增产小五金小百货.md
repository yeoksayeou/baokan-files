Adjusting Personnel, Adding Equipment, Allocating Raw Materials
Xuzhou Increases Production of Small Hardware and Sundries

    (Our dispatch) Xuzhou City has taken active measures to solve the problems of personnel, equipment, and raw materials for the production of small hardware and sundries. This has increased and expanded the production of more than sixty products, including the famous Chen Family kitchen knives, pipe wrenches sold far to the Northeast, and copper whistles popular in the railway system.

    Since late May, the Xuzhou Municipal Party Committee has conducted special investigations and studies on the production and sales of small hardware and sundries. Based on the high demand for many products, it was decided to adopt effective measures such as returning production personnel to their posts and adding equipment to increase and expand the production of these products, in order to meet the needs of people's lives and production. To this end, the Municipal Party Committee established a leading group for the production of small hardware and sundries to strengthen leadership in this work. The Bureau of Light Industry and Chemical Industry, according to market needs, adjusted and expanded the existing factories and production groups in Gulou and Yunlong districts to rationally organize the production of a variety of products. For example, Yunlong District decided to double the size of the Pengcheng Hardware Factory and increase the production of various products such as iron locks.

    Relevant departments jointly conducted a survey and inventory of production personnel, equipment, and raw material supply, and unified allocation under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee. Various machinery industry factories actively transferred experienced technicians to support small hardware production. More than 100 technicians transferred from the Heavy Machinery Factory and the Lifting and Transport Machinery Factory are all skilled in manufacturing various small hardware products. The light industry and chemical industry departments also transferred a group of people skilled in bamboo, rattan, and wicker production to support the production of small commodities in the districts. The Bearing Factory transferred six automatic screw machines to the small hardware production factories, and the city also allocated eight simple lathes to the two districts. With the collaborative support of various large factories and relevant parties, the problems of personnel and equipment needed to expand the production of small hardware and sundries have been basically solved.

    In terms of raw material supply, it was decided to adopt methods such as fully utilizing factory scrap materials and recycling waste products to open up sources of materials. At present, the Ministry of Industry has transferred more than 80 tons of scrap materials suitable for making small hardware. In addition to vigorously carrying out product purchase and sales, commercial departments have also strengthened waste product acquisition throughout the city to support the production of small hardware and sundries in many ways.

    Jiamusi Exceeds May Procurement Plan for Non-Staple Foods and Other Goods
    (Our dispatch) In order to further improve the supply of urban non-staple foods, daily-use industrial products, and raw materials needed for industry, the Jiamusi Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee decided that leading cadres should personally take charge of procurement work, implement the return of procurement personnel to their posts, and strengthen the procurement team. This has achieved significant results in procurement work.

    Last year, the commercial departments in Jiamusi City had 105 procurement personnel. Since the Great Leap Forward, 63 people were transferred to support the iron and steel industry and other business departments. With the growth of the urban population and the continuous increase in purchasing power, the existing manpower engaged in procurement work could no longer meet the needs. Based on this, in addition to deciding that the Minister of Finance and Trade of the Municipal Party Committee, the Deputy Mayor, and the Director of the Commercial Bureau should be responsible for procurement work, the Jiamusi Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee also strengthened procurement resources as needed. In early May, more than 50 people who had previously done procurement work were transferred back to their posts from various work positions to engage in procurement work.

    Currently, the city's procurement staff is divided into two parts: the agricultural and sideline product procurement team led by Deputy Mayor Wang Jiayou goes deep into the people's communes in the suburbs, conducts propaganda, reviews contracts, purchases, and supplies simultaneously, conducts on-site quality inspection, weighing, payment, and shipment. The masses feel it is convenient and actively sell local sideline products. For example, the Sanhe People's Commune purchased 110 pigs in three days. Procurement personnel went to the Songjiang Management District of the Dongfeng People's Commune and learned that the production team lacked wood for repairing pigsties, and the fishery production team lacked pig blood and raincoats for boiling nets. After the procurement personnel contacted the supply departments, supplies were made, which encouraged the commune members to actively engage in non-staple food production.

    Another procurement team consisting of more than 120 people is responsible for the procurement of daily-use industrial products and small hardware raw materials for factories and enterprises. Adhering to the principles of industrial and commercial cooperation, facilitating production, and promoting production development, they went deep into factories and enterprises to understand needs, production capacity, equipment potential, and sources of raw materials, and implemented measures such as on-site acceptance, on-site payment, and direct factory allocation, which helped some factories to promptly solve difficulties such as the shortage of raw materials and small hardware. The Guoguang Tool Factory lacked sodium nitrate for producing knives. The procurement personnel immediately organized efforts to find sources of goods everywhere. As a result, more than 140 kilograms were found from a paper mill, which solved the factory's urgent production needs.

    In this city, due to the strengthening of procurement resources and the efforts to find sources of goods and organize supplies, the city's procurement volume of non-staple foods and daily-use industrial products in May exceeded the monthly plan by 34.9%. Among them, live pigs completed the second-quarter procurement plan 45 days ahead of schedule; more than 2,600 boxes of soap were completed, more than doubling last year; and the procurement of towels, vests, undershirts, etc. was also two to four times more than the same period last year.

    徐州增产小五金小百货
    本报讯　徐州市采取积极措施，解决小五金和小百货生产的人员、设备和原料、材料问题，增加和扩大六十多种产品的生产，其中有名牌产品陈家菜刀、远销东北各地的管子钳及在铁路系统受到欢迎的铜哨子等。
    5月下旬以来，徐州市委对小五金和小百货产品的产销情况，进行了专门的调查研究，根据许多产品供不应求的情况，决定采取生产人员归队和增添设备等有效措施，增加和扩大这些产品的生产，以满足人民生活和生产的需要。为此，市委成立了小五金、小百货生产领导小组，来加强对这项工作的领导。轻化工业局根据市场需要，把鼓楼、云龙两个区现有生产厂和生产小组，加以调整和扩展，合理组织多品种生产。如云龙区决定把彭城五金厂扩大一倍，增加铁皮锁等多种产品的生产。
    各有关部门共同对生产人员、设备和原材料供应进行摸底排队，在市委的直接领导下统一调配。机械工业各厂积极抽调有经验的技术工人支援小五金生产，重型机械厂和起重运输机械厂调出的一百余名技术工人，他们都是制造各种小五金产品的能手。轻化工业部门也把一批擅长条、竹、藤器生产的人员调出来，支援区里的小百货生产。轴承厂把六部罗丝机调给了小五金生产工厂，市里还分配给两个区八台简易车床。在各个大厂和有关方面的协作支援下，小五金和小百货扩大生产所需的人员和设备问题，已经基本解决。
    在原材料供应方面，决定采取充分利用工厂的下脚料和废品回收回用等办法，开辟材料来源。现在工业部已调出了八十多吨适宜做小五金的下脚料。商业部门除了大力开展产品购销工作以外，并在全市加强了废品收购等工作，从多方面支持小五金和小百货生产。
    佳木斯五月份超额完成副食品等采购计划
    本报讯　中共佳木斯市委和市人民委员会为了进一步做好城市副食品、日用工业品和工业需要的原料材料的供应工作，决定由领导干部亲自抓采购工作，并且实行了采购员归队，壮大了采购队伍，收购工作收到了显著效果。
    佳木斯市各商业部门，去年有采购员一百零五人，大跃进以来，先后抽出了六十三名支援钢铁工业和其他业务部门，随着城市人口的增长，购买力的不断上升，现有的从事采购工作的人力已不能适应需要。据此，中共佳木斯市委和市人民委员会除决定由市委财贸部长、副市长和商业局长负责采购工作以外，根据需要还加强了采购力量，在5月初，把过去做采购工作的五十多人从各工作岗位调回归队，从事采购工作。
    目前，这个市的采购工作人员共分为两部分：由副市长汪家有领导的农副产品采购队伍，深入郊区各人民公社，边宣传、边复查合同、边收购、边供应，就地检质、就地检斤、就地付款和起运。群众感到方便，积极出售土副产品，如在三合人民公社三天就收购了一百一十头猪。收购人员到东风人民公社松江管理区，了解到生产队修猪舍缺木材，渔业生产队煮网缺猪血和缺雨衣，采购员同供应部门联系以后作了供应，鼓舞了社员们进行副食品生产的积极性。
    另一部分由一百二十多人组成的采购队，负责日用工业品和工厂企业小五金原料材料的采购工作。他们本着工商协作，便利生产，促进生产发展的原则，深入工厂企业，摸需要、摸生产能力、摸设备潜力、摸原料材料来源，实行就厂验收，就厂付款和就厂直拨等措施，帮助某些工厂及时解决了原料材料和小五金不足等困难。国光工具厂生产刀具缺少硝酸钠，采购人员立即组织力量四出寻找货源，结果从造纸厂找到一百四十多公斤，解决了这个厂生产的迫切需要。
    这个城市，由于加强了采购力量，千方百计地寻找货源组织供应，5月份全市的副食品和日用工业品的采购额，超过月份计划34.9％。其中生猪提前四十五天完成了二季度采购计划；肥皂完成了二千六百多箱，比去年提高一倍以上；毛巾、背心、汗衫等也较去年同时期多采购了二倍到四倍不等。
