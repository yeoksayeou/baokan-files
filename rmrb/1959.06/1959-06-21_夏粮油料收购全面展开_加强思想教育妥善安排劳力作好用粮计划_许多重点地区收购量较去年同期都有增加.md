Summer grain and oil procurement work has fully commenced from south to north. Currently, summer grain harvesting has been completed in southern provinces, and about 80% has been harvested in northern provinces. Various regions are seizing this opportunity to free up more resources to do a good job in grain and oil procurement. As of June 15th, the national procurement of rapeseed has already exceeded the procurement volume for the same period last year. Anhui Province, which has made faster progress in procurement, has completed 61% of its annual procurement plan, and the amount of rapeseed stored in Zhejiang Province has increased by more than 80% compared to the same period last year. In the earlier period, the summer grain procurement work was somewhat slow due to the rainy season in southern provinces and the busy summer harvesting and planting, but since mid-June, it has accelerated significantly. Procurement volumes in key wheat-producing areas such as Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Hebei have all increased compared to the same period last year. On the 15th, the amount of grain stored in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, increased by one-fold compared to the procurement volume in the first half of the month.

Many regions have paid attention to strengthening policy propaganda and patriotic education for the vast number of commune members during the summer grain procurement work. People's communes in Yunmeng County, Hubei Province, held meetings at the production team level, using methods such as recollection and comparison to calculate savings accounts, extensively conducting patriotic education among cadres and commune members. Commune members of Jin Dian Commune recalled the situation in 1954 when the area was hit by floods, and the state transported grain from all over the country to provide relief. Huang Shuiqing, the captain of the Xianfeng Production Team, said, "Our wheat-producing area relies on supply from others for three seasons a year. Now that we have a good harvest, we should also support others." Under this call, commune members enthusiastically sold grain. Now, the county's summer grain procurement task has been overfulfilled. Commune members in Linyi, Cangshan, Tancheng and other counties and cities in Shandong Province generally believe during discussions that "if the big river has water, the small river will not be dry; if the country has grain, we will not worry." Therefore, they have actively formulated plans to deliver grain quickly, sell more grain, and deliver good grain. After conducting propaganda and education work, Gao Xuefu, a commune member of Chengguan People's Commune in Guan County, Shandong Province, said: "If it were not for the Party's leadership in our reasonable close planting and the state's supply of fertilizers and seeds, how could this year's wheat grow so well? We cannot only care about ourselves and disregard the country." Jiang Chunling, a 72-year-old commune member, also said that this spring, the country transferred grain to support us, and we must sell more grain to support the country now that we have a good harvest. Therefore, the entire commune decided to sell more grain, sell it quickly, and sell good grain, and by June 12th, they had overfulfilled the task of delivering grain to the state.

Properly arranging labor and grain usage plans is another key issue to ensure the rapid completion of the procurement task. Many regions have put forward the slogan of "grasping production with one hand and grasping procurement with the other," so as to ensure that production and procurement do not interfere with each other. On June 6th, Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, mobilized 300,000 people and implemented methods such as "producing during the day and delivering grain in the evening" or "producing for half a day and delivering grain for half a day," completing 42% of the procurement task in one day. In Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, the Heping Commune used one team to handle procurement and another team to handle production, putting more than 600,000 jin of grain into storage in one day on the 14th. Qujing County, Yunnan Province, after arranging the commune's grain usage plan, adopted the method of threshing, drying, and storing grain simultaneously, completing the county's procurement task in four days.

As the summer grain and oil procurement work has just fully commenced, it is still far from completing the state's procurement plan, and the procurement progress in some scattered wheat-producing areas is relatively slow. Various regions are working hard to strive for the full completion of the state's procurement plan.

### 夏粮油料收购全面展开  加强思想教育妥善安排劳力作好用粮计划  许多重点地区收购量较去年同期都有增加

    夏粮油料收购全面展开
    加强思想教育妥善安排劳力作好用粮计划
    许多重点地区收购量较去年同期都有增加
    新华社20日讯　夏季粮食和油料的收购工作已经从南到北全面展开。目前南方各省夏粮已经收割完毕，北方各省也已收割80％左右，各地正抓紧这一时机腾出更多的力量做好粮油收购工作。截至6月15日止，全国收购的油菜籽已经超过去年同期的收购量，收购进度较快的安徽省已完成全年收购计划的61％，浙江省入库的油菜籽比去年同期增加80％多。夏粮的收购工作前一时期由于南方各省多雨和忙于夏收夏种，收购进度一度比较迟缓，但自6月中旬以来已经显著加快，河南、湖北、四川、河北等重点产麦区的收购量都比去年同期增加。河北省邯郸专区15日一天的入库数就比前半个月的收购量增加一倍。
    许多地区在夏粮征购工作中注意加强对广大社员进行政策宣传和爱国主义教育。湖北省云梦县各人民公社以生产队为单位召开了会议，用回忆对比算节约账的办法，广泛向干部和社员进行爱国主义教育。金店公社社员回忆到1954年当地遭到水灾时，国家从全国各地运粮救济他们的情况。先锋生产队队长黄水清说：“我们这个产麦区一年有三季靠人供应，现在我们丰收了，也应该支援别人”。社员们在这一号召下踊跃售粮。现在全县的夏粮征购任务已经超额完成。山东省临沂、苍山、郯城等县市的社员在讨论时，普遍认为：“大河有水小河流，国家有粮咱不愁。”因此，都积极地制订了快交粮、多卖粮、交好粮的计划。山东冠县城关人民公社在进行了宣传教育工作以后，社员高学福说：“今年的小麦要不是党领导我们合理密植，国家供应肥料、种子，怎么能长得这么好？我们不能只顾自己不顾国家。”七十二岁的老社员江春岭也说，今年春天国家调粮食支援了我们，我们丰收了也要多卖粮支援国家。因此全社决定要多卖粮、快卖粮，卖好粮，到6月12日就超额完成了向国家交售粮食的任务。
    妥善安排劳动力和用粮计划，是保证收购任务迅速完成的另一关键问题。许多地区提出“一手抓生产，一手抓收购”的口号，做到生产收购两不误。四川省南充县本月6日出动三十万人，实行“白天生产，傍晚送粮”或“半天生产半天送粮”等办法，一天就完成征购任务的42％。陕西省咸阳市和平公社一套人马搞征购，一套人马搞生产，14日一天就入库六十多万斤。云南省曲靖县在安排好公社的用粮计划后，采取边打、边晒、边入库的办法，全县的征购任务在四天之内全部完成。
    由于目前夏季粮油征购工作刚刚全面展开，距离完成国家收购计划还比较远，有些小麦分散产区的收购进度较慢，各地正在积极努力，争取全面完成国家收购计划。
