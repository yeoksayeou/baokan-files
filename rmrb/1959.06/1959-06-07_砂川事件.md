    "The Sunagawa Incident"

    The "Sunagawa Incident" occurred in July 1957. On that day, the people of Sunagawa Town, Japan, rose up to oppose the United States' expansion of the Tachikawa US Air Force Base near Sunagawa Town. The Nobusuke Kishi government, using the "Special Criminal Law" enacted under Article 3 of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" as a pretext, arrested seven union cadres and university students, including Shigeru Sakata, and attempted to sentence them to six months in prison each. This traitorous act by the Kishi Nobusuke government aroused the righteous indignation of the broad masses of the Japanese people and some judges.
    On March 30, 1959, the Tokyo District Court, presided over by Judge Akio Date, justly declared the seven defendants in the "Sunagawa Incident" not guilty. This judgment also solemnly declared that the US military's stationing in Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty" were violations of the post-war Japanese Constitution's prohibition of war and prohibition of possessing war potential, and that the so-called "Special Criminal Law" itself was a humiliating and power-ceding decree.
    The US-Japanese reactionaries were greatly shocked by this and instigated the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office to appeal to the Supreme Court on the 2nd of this month, attempting to overturn the just verdict of the Tokyo District Court through the Supreme Court.

    “砂川事件”
    “砂川事件”发生在1957年7月。那天，日本砂川町人民起来反对美国扩大砂川町附近的立川美空军基地，岸信介政府竟以违反根据日美“安全条约”第三条制定的“刑事特别法”为借口，逮捕了坂田茂等七名工会干部和大学生，并企图判他们每人半年徒刑。岸信介政府这一卖国行为，激起了广大日本人民和一些法官的义愤。
    1959年3月30日，东京地方裁判所在伊达秋雄裁判长的主持下，公正地宣布“砂川事件”七名被告无罪。这一判决并根据战后日本宪法禁止战争和禁止保有战力的条款，严正宣布美军驻在日本和日美
  “安全条约”都是违背宪法的，而所谓“刑事特别法”本身更是丧权辱国的法令。
    美日反动派对此大为震惊，主使东京地方检察厅于本月2日越级向最高裁判所提出上诉，企图通过最高裁判所推翻东京地方裁判所的正义判决。
