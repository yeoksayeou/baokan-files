Xinhua News Agency, June 4th, Tokyo News: Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto today issued a statement on the results of the House of Councillors election, saying that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party increased their seats by seven and one respectively in this election. The total number of seats won by the two parties exceeded one-third of the total number of seats in the House of Councillors, shattering the Liberal Democratic Party's conspiracy to amend the Constitution. This is an important achievement for the democratic forces in this election.
    He pointed out that this achievement was obtained under the circumstances of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party's rampant vote-buying, illegal suppression of democratic forces, and anti-communist propaganda.
    Miyamoto said that the fact that the unified candidates of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party defeated the Liberal Democratic Party candidates and were elected as members in Yamanashi Prefecture shows that the unity of the democratic forces is the most reliable basis for winning victory.
    He said that the Japanese Communist Party, in this election struggle, focused on exposing the essence of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and launched a fierce struggle against the reactionary forces, which was completely correct. The struggle of the Japanese Communist Party played an encouraging role in the progress of the Socialist Party and all democratic forces in the election campaign.
    Miyamoto stated that the Japanese Communist Party will strive to strengthen the Party's power in the future, and will stand at the forefront of the Japanese people to fight for peace and independence. He finally expressed the hope that the Socialist Party will penetrate deeper into the people in the future and launch an uncompromising struggle against the reactionary forces.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 4th, Tokyo News: The Japan Socialist Party today issued a statement on the results of the House of Councillors election, saying that the Socialist Party has occupied 85 seats through the House of Councillors election, possessing for the first time the power needed to prevent the amendment of the Constitution.
    In its statement, the Socialist Party stated that it will launch a national movement against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the future, and will fight against the money and power politics of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

    日共总书记宫本显治指出
    选举结果表明民主力量获得重要成就
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治今天就参议院选举结果发表谈话说，社会党和共产党在这次选举中分别增加七个议席和一个议席，两党获得的议席总数超过参议院议席总数的三分之一，粉碎了自由民主党企图修改宪法的阴谋。这是民主力量在这次选举中获得的重要成就。
    他指出，这个成就是在岸信介内阁和自由民主党大肆收买选票、非法镇压民主力量和进行反共宣传的情况下获得的。
    宫本说，社会党和共产党的统一候选人在山梨县击败自由民主党候选人而当选为议员这件事表明，民主力量的统一是争取胜利的最可靠的基础。
    他说，日本共产党在这次选举斗争中着重揭露岸信介内阁和自由民主党修改日美“安全条约”的本质，同反动势力展开了一场激烈的斗争，这完全是正确的。日本共产党的斗争在竞选斗争中对社会党和全体民主力量的进展起了鼓舞作用。
    宫本表示，日本共产党今后要努力加强建设党的力量，并且将站在日本人民的前列为争取和平和独立而斗争。他最后表示希望社会党今后更加深入人民，并对反动势力展开不妥协的斗争。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天就参议院选举结果发表声明说，社会党通过参议院选举占有了八十五个议席，第一次拥有能够阻止修改宪法所需要的力量。
    社会党在声明中表示，今后它要展开反对修改日美“安全条约”的国民运动，并且同岸信介政府的金钱和权力政治进行斗争。
