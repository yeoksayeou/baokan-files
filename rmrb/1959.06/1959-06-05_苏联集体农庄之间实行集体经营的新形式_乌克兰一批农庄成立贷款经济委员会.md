Xinhua News Agency, June 4th. According to a TASS report on June 3rd: Twenty-five collective farms in the Aleksandrovsky District of the Kirovograd Oblast in the Ukrainian Republic recently established a unified planned economic institution - the Loan Economic Committee. This is a new form of collective management among collective farms.

    The purpose of establishing this committee is to make all twenty-five collective farms economic units that achieve equally significant growth in production and income, in order to accelerate the further development of the collective economy.

    The functions of the committee include: providing short-term interest-free loans to collective farms lacking working capital for the construction of roads, houses, cultural and livelihood facilities, and productive buildings, to further mechanize and electrify agricultural production.

    Each collective farm joining the committee is obligated to make a certain amount of investment to the committee for its disposal, as the material basis for the committee's activities. These investments include open-pit mines, mills, oil presses, electric production equipment, and a brick factory with an annual output of 13 million bricks.

    The annual income of the enterprises under the committee is more than 15 million rubles. According to the decision of the majority of the members of the Management Committee, this amount can be used to grant loans to collective farms for a period of six to ten months, and for allocations for construction carried out using standardized designs and industrialized methods.

    Currently, the committee has begun to establish a large-scale fresh and dried fruit processing factory. The committee plans to complete more than 150 houses, two cultural palaces, three schools, a hospital, and some productive buildings in the collective farms under its jurisdiction in 1959.

    In the next two years, the committee intends to establish public bakeries, kitchens, and service enterprises in the collective farm villages, and install tap water pipes.

    苏联集体农庄之间实行集体经营的新形式
    乌克兰一批农庄成立贷款经济委员会
    新华社4日讯  据塔斯社3日报道：乌克兰共和国基洛夫格勒州亚历山大区的二十五个集体农庄，不久以前成立了一个统一领导的计划经济机构——贷款经济委员会。这是集体农庄之间实行集体经营的一种新形式。
    成立这个委员会的目的在于：使所有二十五个集体农庄都成为在生产和收入上同样取得很大增长的经济单位，以加速集体经济的进一步发展。
    委员会的职能包括：对缺少周转资金的集体农庄发放修建道路、住宅、文化生活和生产性建筑物的短期无利息贷款，使农业生产进一步机械化和电气化。
    加入委员会的各集体农庄有义务向委员会作一定数量的投资，交给委员会支配，作为委员会活动的物质基础。在这些投资中，有露天采矿场、磨坊、制油厂、电动生产设备和年产一千三百万块砖的制砖厂。
    委员会所属企业的年度收入在一千五百万卢布以上。按照管理委员会多数委员的决定，这笔款项可以用作对集体农庄发放为期六个月至十个月的贷款，用作按标准设计、以工业化方法进行建筑的拨款。
    现在，委员会已着手建立大型干鲜果品加工工厂。委员会计划于1959年在所属的集体农庄中建成一百五十多所住宅、两所文化宫、三所学校、一所医院和一些生产性建筑物。
    在最近两年，委员会打算在集体农庄的村落中建立公用的面包房、厨房及服务性企业，并安装自来水管。
