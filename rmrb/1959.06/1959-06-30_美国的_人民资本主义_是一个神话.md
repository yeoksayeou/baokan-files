    America's "People's Capitalism" is a Myth
    Canada  Peter Whitehouse
    Editor's Note: The American "National Guardian" weekly published an article on June 29th exposing the myth of America's "People's Capitalism," pointing out that it is used to cover up the severe inequality in wealth distribution in that country. This article is Peter Whitehouse's radio script from Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on March 30th. Whitehouse lost his job as an employee of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for publishing this talk criticizing capitalism.
    This claim of people's capitalism can be seen in the large number of advertisements recently published in magazines by companies such as General Electric, and in the beautiful brochures published at great cost by the public relations departments of New Jersey's Mobil Oil, DuPont, and similar large industrial enterprises.
  In brief, the content of this theory is: Because nearly nine million people in the United States own some stock, this universality of ownership allows these fortunate nine million people to effectively control the nation's economy, and thus the country as well.
    Nine million people account for only 5% of the population, which means that 95% of the people have no stock at all.
    However, an author named Ernst Havermann in "Life" magazine some time ago must have discovered this obvious error, because he cunningly expanded this number of nine million shareholders to one hundred and six million—by what means? By a simple method: that is, including those who have a few dollars in insurance and pension plans.
    Do we really have nine or ten million people's capitalists? The answer can only be obtained by looking at how these stocks are distributed.
    Take the wage earners in the United States… what do they own? According to official figures, only one in a hundred wage earners has a little stock… The total value of all stocks owned by wage earners is no more than 750 million U.S. dollars, which is such a small amount that it is completely insignificant. In contrast, the Rockefeller and Mellon families own more than three billion U.S. dollars in stocks, and the DuPont family owns four hundred million U.S. dollars. In fact, the Rockefeller family's assets in New Jersey's Mobil Oil alone are twice the value of stocks owned by all wage earners in the United States.
    Therefore, wage earners are not people's capitalists at all.
    Last June, a prominent American economist, Victor Perlo, said that the one hundred largest shareholders of New Jersey Mobil Oil owned nearly half of the stock. On the other hand, more than one hundred thousand shareholders, accounting for three-quarters of the total, owned less than 8% of the oil company's stock. This distribution ratio of stocks applies to all large American companies.
    Therefore, this people's capitalism is a myth… In my opinion, the real purpose of this myth is to cover up the fact that… the distribution of wealth in the United States—said to be the most democratic country in the world—is extremely unequal. The economic control of the United States is not in the hands of ten million people's capitalists, but in the hands of a very small number of economic giants. According to Ebweiot, former chairman of the Canadian Political Science Association, these economic giants may consist of about two thousand people, that is, one in eighty thousand of the American population. By the way, the situation in Canada is exactly the same. Canada's population is one-tenth of the United States' population, and the number of economic giants there is one-tenth of that of the United States… about two hundred people.
    Even in the prosperous year of 1956, the average annual income of 35 million out of the 45 million families in the United States—about three-quarters of American households—was less than 2,500 U.S. dollars. At the same time, one-thousandth of the families (the families with the highest income in the United States) had the same income as more than half of the American families—the families with the lower income. About 6% of the people own 80% of the savings in banks.
    Very few Americans can save a lot of money to engage in large-scale investment.

### 美国的“人民资本主义”是一个神话

    美国的“人民资本主义”是一个神话
    加拿大  彼得·怀特豪斯
    编者按　6月29日出版的一期美国“国民前卫”周刊登载了一篇文章，揭露美国的“人民资本主义”的神话，指出它是用来掩盖这个国家在财富分配方面的严重的不平等状况的。这篇文章是彼得·怀特豪斯3月30日在加拿大广播公司的广播稿。由于发表了这篇批评资本主义的谈话，怀特豪斯失掉了作为加拿大广播公司职员的工作。
    在像通用电气公司这样一些公司最近在杂志上所刊登的大量广告中和由新泽西美孚油公司、杜邦公司以及类似的巨大工业企业的公共关系部门花很大成本出版的漂亮的小册子中，都可以看到这种人民资本主义的主张。
  扼要地说，这种理论的内容是：由于在美国，将近九百万人都拥有一些股票，这种所有权的普遍性使这幸运的九百万人有效地控制着国家的经济，从而也控制着这个国家。
    九百万人只占人口的5％，这就是说有95％的人根本没有什么股票。
    但是，不久前“生活”杂志上的一个名叫恩斯特·哈佛曼的作者想必是发现了这个明显的错误，因为他狡猾地把这个九百万股东的数字扩大到一亿零六百万——用什么办法呢？用一种简单的办法：那就是把在保险和养老金计划方面有几块美元的人都包括在内。
    我们确实有九百万或一千万的人民资本家吗？只有看一看这些股票是如何分配的就可以得到答复了。
    拿美国的靠工资生活者来说……他们占有什么呢？根据官方数字，在一百个靠工资生活的人中，只有一人有一点儿股票……靠工资生活者所拥有的全部股票加在一起，总共也不过七亿五千万美元，这个数目是这样小，因此它是完全不足道的。相反地，洛克菲勒和梅隆两个家族拥有三十多亿美元的股票，杜邦家族拥有四亿美元。事实上，洛克菲勒家族仅仅在新泽西美孚油公司的财产就等于美国一切靠工资生活的人所拥有的股票的两倍。
    因此工资生活者根本不是人民资本家。
    去年6月，一位著名的美国经济学家维克托·佩洛说新泽西美孚油公司的一百户最大的股东拥有将近一半股票。另一方面，占总数四分之三的十万多户股东却只拥有这家石油公司不到8％的股票。股票的这种分配比例适用于所有美国大公司。
    因此这种人民资本主义是一个神话……，依我看，这个神话的真正目的是想掩盖这一个事实……财富的分配在美国——据说它是世界上最民主的国家——是极其不平等的。美国的经济控制权不掌握在一千万人民资本家的手中，而是掌握在极少数的经济巨头手中。据前加拿大政治科学协会主席埃布维奥特说，这些经济巨头可能由大约两千人组成，亦就是占美国人口的八万分之一。顺便说一下，加拿大的情况也完全一样。加拿大的人口为美国人口的十分之一，那里经济巨头占美国经济巨头的十分之一……大约二百人。
    甚至在1956年经济繁荣的年代里，美国四千五百万家庭中三千五百万户——约占美国住户的四分之三——一年的平均收入不到两千五百美元。同时，千分之一的家庭（美国收入最多的家庭）的收入等于二分之一以上的美国家庭——收入比较少的家庭的收入一样多。银行中80％的储蓄为大约6％的人所有。
    能够省下很多钱来从事大量投资的美国人是非常少的。
