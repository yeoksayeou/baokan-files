    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 1st: Polish People's Republic Foreign Minister Rapacki said on May 31st, when he met with a German Democratic Republic radio reporter stationed in Warsaw, that concluding a peace treaty with Germany based on the Soviet Union's proposal is the simplest and best way of all possible ways to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. He also said that resolving the West Berlin issue on the basis of the Soviet proposal is in the vital interests of the Polish people.

    Rapacki emphasized that the most important issue for European peace and security is to eliminate the sources of danger in this part of the world. I am referring here to the status of West Berlin and the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany. To normalize the situation in Europe, it is necessary to start here. Concluding a peace treaty will also help to take measures for disarmament in Central Europe, the whole of Europe, and even the world.

    Rapacki believes that the most important factors in concluding a peace treaty with Germany are: the treaty countries must recognize that the situation in Europe cannot be changed by force; the root of the danger must be eliminated through joint efforts; recognition that the existing borders of Germany with its neighbors are final and inviolable; and recognition of the fact that the independent and equal German Democratic Republic exists. By concluding a treaty, favorable conditions will be created for restoring German unity through agreements and approaches between the two Germanys. Establishing a confederation of the two Germanys will be the best way to achieve reunification.

    Speaking of the Oder-Neisse Peace Border, he said that all sober-minded politicians in the world recognize that the Oder-Neisse border is unchangeable. He denounced the danger of the revanchist remarks of some West German elements, saying that therefore, a clear and unambiguous recognition of the Oder-Neisse border is of great significance for European peace and security.

    腊帕茨基谈建立中欧无原子武器区
    应从缔结对德和约着手
    新华社柏林1日电　波兰人民共和国外交部长腊帕茨基5月31日接见德意志民主共和国广播电台驻华沙记者时说，根据苏联的建议缔结对德和约，是在中欧建立无原子武器区的一切可能的办法中最简单、最好的办法。他还说，在苏联建议基础上解决西柏林问题是符合波兰人民的切身利益的。
    腊帕茨基强调说，对欧洲和平和安全的最重要问题是消除世界这部分地区的危险策源地。我这里指的是西柏林的地位和缔结对德和约的问题。要使欧洲的局势正常化，必须从这里着手。缔结对德和约也会有助于采取在中欧、整个欧洲，甚至全世界裁军的措施。
    腊帕茨基认为，缔结对德和约的最重要因素是：缔约各国必须承认，欧洲的局势不可能用强力的手段来改变；危险的根源要用共同的努力来消除；承认德国与其邻国现有的疆界是最后的和不可侵犯的；承认自主的、平等的德意志民主共和国存在的事实。通过缔结和约，将会创造良好的条件，以便通过两个德国达成协议和接近的方法恢复德国的统一。建立两个德国的邦联将是导向恢复统一的最好途径。
    他谈到奥得—尼斯和平分界线时说，世界各国所有冷静的政治家都认识到，奥得—尼斯分界线是不可改变的。他斥责了西德一些复仇主义分子言论的危险性，他说，因此，明确地、毫不含糊地承认奥得—尼斯分界线对于欧洲的和平和安全具有重大意义。
