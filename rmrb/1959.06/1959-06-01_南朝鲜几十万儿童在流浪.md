Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 31st: Seoul dispatch: Under the rule of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, children in South Korea are living a very miserable life.

The fate of the more than 200,000 South Korean war orphans who lost their parents during the war is the most tragic. In the years after the war, some of these war orphans have starved to death or died of illness, and some have become hooligans; most of the orphans who have survived death are wandering the streets, living by scavenging and begging.

The ranks of homeless children in South Korea are expanding every day. Most of the hundreds of thousands of children of the 500,000 South Korean widows who lost their husbands during the war are also wandering the streets.

In South Korea, many urban residents are forced to abandon their biological children due to the hardships of life. According to South Korea's "Dong-A Ilbo" newspaper, in Seoul alone, 1,127 babies were abandoned by their parents last year; from January to early February this year, another 71 babies were abandoned.

The Syngman Rhee clique not only does not try to relieve the tens of thousands of homeless children in South Korea, but instead sells them to foreign capitalists and farmers as slaves. According to South Korea's "New Sun" magazine, from 1954 to 1957, 1,228 children under the age of 14 were sold to the United States, and since then, another 1,312 children have been sold under the guise of being "adopted" by foreigners.

Currently, more than one million school-age children in South Korea are out of school. The physical condition of children in school is generally poor. According to "Kyunghyang Shinmun," 40% of students at Wangsan National School in Myeongju County, Gangwon Province, are "skinny and malnourished." Under circumstances in which the South Korean authorities are using schools as a means of making profits, the working people have to worry about raising their children's tuition fees every semester, and some students even commit suicide because they cannot afford the exorbitant tuition fees.

South Korean children are also often injured by the American occupation forces or killed and injured during US military exercises. On May 25th this year, in an American anti-tank mine explosion that occurred in Haman County, Gyeongsangnam-do, a Korean child was killed and four children were seriously injured.

### 南朝鲜几十万儿童在流浪

    南朝鲜几十万儿童在流浪
    新华社平壤31日电　汉城消息：在美帝国主义和李承晚集团统治下的南朝鲜，儿童们正过着十分悲惨的生活。
    战争时期丧失父母的二十多万南朝鲜战争孤儿的命运最为悲惨。经过战后几年，这些战争孤儿中，有的已经饿死或病死，有的沦为流氓；幸免死亡的孤儿中的大部分都流浪街头，靠捡破烂、求乞过活。
    南朝鲜流浪儿童的队伍每天都在扩大。战争时期丧失丈夫的五十万南朝鲜寡妇的数十万孩子中，大部分也都在街头流浪。
    在南朝鲜，很多城市居民由于生活所迫，不得不舍弃他们的亲生子女。据南朝鲜“东亚日报”报道，仅在汉城市，去年一年中就有一千一百二十七名婴儿被他们的父母遗弃；从今年1月到2月初，又有七十一名婴儿被遗弃。
    李承晚集团不仅不设法救济南朝鲜的几十万流浪儿童，反而把他们卖给外国资本家和农场主当奴隶。据南朝鲜“新太阳”杂志报道，从1954年到1957年，有一千二百二十八名十四岁以下的儿童被卖往美国，这以后，又有一千三百十二名儿童在由外国人“收养”的名义下被出卖。
    目前，南朝鲜有一百多万学龄儿童失学。上学的儿童的体质普遍很差。据“京乡新闻”报道，江原道溟州郡旺山国民学校有40％的学生“骨瘦如柴，营养失调”。在南朝鲜当局把学校当做谋利手段的情况下，劳动人民每学期都要为筹划子女的学费而发愁，有的学生甚至因为交不起巨额的学费而自杀。
    南朝鲜儿童还常常遭到美国占领军的伤害或在美军举行军事演习时被打死和打伤。今年5月25日，在庆尚南道咸安城发生的美国反坦克地雷爆炸事件中，一个朝鲜儿童被炸死，四名儿童受了重伤。
