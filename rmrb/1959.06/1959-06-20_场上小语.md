    Fieldside Vignettes
    Li Yingqing
    Let the sky be three times three feet higher
    Wheat stacks are as high and large as golden mountains
    The tops of the golden mountains bump against the sky
    After threshing for half a day
    Only moved a mountain peak
    "Wheat stacks are higher, making the sky seem lower
    Need to send a radio message to the heavens
    Next year's wheat stacks must be higher than this year
    Let them be three times three feet higher"
    Laughter and song fill the threshing ground
    You with a shovel, me with a fork
    Wheat kernels fall with a whoosh
    Like gold kernels falling from the sky
    Soon accumulated a golden lump
    There are golden lumps every year
    But none as big as this year's
    Just because the commune has been realized
    The old man's heart blossomed
    Spirits high, threshing joyfully
    Happily said:
    "Young people, keep threshing harder
    Look at these moves of this old man
    Tomorrow we'll deliver the public grain
    And then listen to Uncle's whip crack, crack, crack"
    Laughter scattered across the field
    Loading, hauling
    The accountant's abacus clicks
    Two ones become five
    Five fours become eight
    "Per-mu yield has exceeded 580 jin!"
    Songs, laughter, scattered across the field

    场上小语

    让天再高三丈三
    麦堆高大像金山
    金山顶顶撞着了天
    摊了半天场
    只搬了个山尖尖
    “麦堆高了显天低
    要给老天打个无线电
    明年麦堆要比今年高
    让它再高三丈三”
    笑歌声里扬场忙
    你一锨，我一杈
    麦颗落个哗哗哗
    好像天上把金颗下
    一会积了个金圪答
    年年都有金圪答
    往年那有今年大
    只因实现公社化
    老汉心里开了花
    精神抖擞扬的欢
    高兴愉快说了话：
    “小伙子们加油扬
    看看老汉这几下
    明天去把公粮送
    再听大叔的鞭子叭、叭、叭”
    满场笑声撒
    装的装、拉的拉
    会计的算盘吧啦啦
    二一添作五
    五四倍作八
    “亩产上了五百八！”
    歌声、笑声，满场撒
