Growing sesame has many benefits.
Ministry of Agriculture Oil Crops Division

We have many favorable conditions for growing sesame: First, sesame is highly adaptable and can be grown in general soils as long as the terrain is high and dry and the drainage is good. Sesame can also grow in slightly silty soil, alluvial soil, and unstructured carbonate chernozem. Second, sesame has a short growing period; general sesame varieties mature in about 110 days. In areas with long frost-free periods in the south, sesame can be rotated with other crops, allowing for two or three harvests a year. In the Huanghuai region, sesame sown in June can generally mature. In particular, due to sesame's drought resistance, in the drought-prone areas of the Yangtze River Basin in autumn, after the harvest of early soybeans, early corn, early rice, and other crops, a season of autumn sesame can be planted during the autumn fallow period. Third, the amount of sesame seeds required for sowing is small, with only half a catty to one catty of seeds needed per mu of sesame.

In addition to large-scale sowing, sesame can also be intercropped with crops such as sweet potatoes and beans to expand the area sown. Sesame can also be replanted in peanut fields with missing seedlings. In addition, the masses can be mobilized to widely plant sesame in all available idle plots to increase total oil production.

To grow sesame well and actively increase yield per unit area, according to local experience, the following key aspects should be focused on:

	(1) Deep plowing and fine harrowing, timely early sowing. The land for planting sesame needs to be deeply plowed and finely harrowed to achieve loose soil, fine topsoil, and ensure full and strong seedlings. In summer and autumn sesame planting areas, the past habits of not paying attention to soil preparation, or even sowing in stubble fields, should be changed. Regarding the sowing time of sesame, for summer and autumn sesame, it is necessary to seize the time for early sowing, and as soon as the previous crop matures, it should be harvested, cultivated, harrowed, and sown, which can significantly increase sesame yield.

	(2) Apply plenty of base fertilizer and top dressing. Sesame blooms and bears fruit successively, with a long flowering period, so it is necessary to apply plenty of base fertilizer and increase top dressing to supplement the needs of crop growth in the middle and late stages. Base fertilizer should be applied in conjunction with soil preparation; top dressing can be applied in two stages. When the seedlings are five or six inches high, top dressing can be applied once according to the condition of the seedlings; after sesame blooms, more fast-acting fertilizer should be applied to promote sesame flowering, pod setting, and full grains. The experience summarized in some places is: "Sufficient base fertilizer, stable seedling fertilizer, and fierce flowering fertilizer." This is in line with the growth characteristics of crops.

	(3) Early weeding, frequent weeding, and grasping thinning and setting seedlings. Sesame grows slowly during the seedling stage, and this period is also a season of high temperature and rain, so weeds grow quickly. Therefore, weeding and thinning should be stepped up to ensure normal seedling growth. As the saying goes, "Sesame weeded tender, top dressing of manure," this is the reason. When sesame grows two pairs of true leaves, the first weeding should be started, and generally three or four shallow weedings should be done from emergence to the early flowering stage; when the seedlings are two to three inches high, seedlings can be set. The density of retained seedlings should be determined according to soil fertility, variety characteristics, and other conditions. Generally, varieties with relatively barren soil and non-branching single stalks can be retained more densely; varieties with fertile soil and branching types should be retained more sparsely. The situation varies from place to place, and the masses should have good discussions and research to formulate reasonable density specifications.

	(4) Pay attention to crop rotation. Farmers in many areas have the experience that sesame must be rotated. If sesame is continuously planted on the same piece of land, diseases will occur in large numbers. Therefore, in areas with severe diseases, sesame is best rotated with cereal crops; in areas with mild or no diseases, bean stubble can also be selected for planting. Early-maturing silkworm broad beans and peas from summer harvest crops have good soil fertility, and planting sesame will significantly increase yield.

Now is the sesame sowing season, and it is hoped that all localities will seize the opportunity and actively expand the sown area.

    种芝麻好处多
    农业部油料处
    我们种植芝麻有许多有利的条件：第一、芝麻的适应性强，只要地势高燥、排水良好的一般土壤，都可种植。轻微的淤泥土、冲积土、以及无结构的碳酸盐黑钙土，芝麻也可以生长。第二、芝麻的生长期短，一般的芝麻品种，一百一十天左右就可成熟。南方无霜期长的地区，芝麻可和其他作物轮作，实行一年两熟或三熟。黄淮流域6月份播种芝麻，一般也能成熟。特别由于芝麻耐旱，在长江流域秋旱地区，早黄豆、早玉米、早稻等作物收获后，还可利用秋闲时间增种一季秋芝麻。第三、播种芝麻用种量少，种一亩芝麻需种子半斤至一斤。
    扩种芝麻的途径，除大面积播种外，还可以与甘薯、豆类等作物间作。花生地里缺苗，亦可补种芝麻；另外，还可发动群众利用一切空闲隙地广泛种植，增加油料总产量。
    要把芝麻种好，积极提高单位面积产量，根据各地经验，应着重抓好以下几个环节：
      （一）深耕细耙，适期早播。种芝麻的地，需要深耕细耙，达到土层疏松，表土细碎，使苗全苗壮。在夏播和秋播芝麻地区，应当改变过去不注意整地，甚至闯茬播种（在茬子地播种）的习惯。关于芝麻的播种时间，就夏秋芝麻来说，要抢时早播，前种作物一成熟，就应随收随耕随耙随种，这样可以显著地提高芝麻的产量。
      （二）多施基肥，加施追肥。芝麻是陆续开花，陆续结果，花期较长，因而要多施基肥，并增加追肥，补充作物中后期生长的需要。基肥应结合整地时施；追肥可分二次施。在苗高五、六寸时，可看苗追一次肥；芝麻开花后，要多追速效肥料，促进芝麻开花结荚，籽粒饱满。有的地方总结的经验是：“底肥要足，苗肥要稳，花肥要狠。”这是符合作物生长的习性的。
    （三）早锄、勤锄，抓紧间苗定苗。芝麻在幼苗时期生长缓慢，此时又是高温多雨季节，杂草生长很快，所以要加紧锄草、匀苗，以保证幼苗正常生长。农谚说：“芝麻薅的嫩，顶上一道粪”，正是这个道理。当芝麻生长两对真叶时，就应开始第一次锄草，一般由出苗到开花初期，要浅锄三、四次；当苗高二到三寸，即可定苗。留苗的密度，应根据土壤肥瘦、品种特性等条件决定。一般是土壤比较瘠薄和不分枝的单秆型品种，可留密些；土壤肥沃和分枝型品种，要留稀些。各地的情况不同，要由群众很好讨论研究，制定出合理的密度规格。
    （四）注意茬口。许多地区的农民都有经验，种芝麻必须实行轮作。如在同一块地上连续重茬种植，病害就会大量发生。因此，在发病较重地区，芝麻最好与禾谷类作物轮作；发病轻微或无病害地区，也可选种豆茬。夏收作物的蚕豌豆成熟早、地力好，种芝麻会显著增产。
    现在正是芝麻播种季节，希望各地抓紧时机，积极扩大播种面积。
