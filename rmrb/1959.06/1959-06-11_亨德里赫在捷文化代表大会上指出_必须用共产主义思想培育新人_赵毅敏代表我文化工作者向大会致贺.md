Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 9th. The Czechoslovak Socialist Cultural Congress continued its sessions on the 9th, proceeding with discussions. A delegation from the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak National Front, consisting of Fierlinger, Hendrych, Kopecký, Kautský, Nieredli, and others, attended the day's meeting.

	Speaking at the morning session, Hendrych said that the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party regards the convocation of this congress as a manifestation of cultural workers' determination to fight shoulder to shoulder with workers and peasants to realize the tasks put forward by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

	He said that realizing the socialist revolution in the ideological sphere of the people is the main content of the socialist cultural revolution. The entire cultural front of Czechoslovakia should actively help the Party to complete this extremely important task of educating, transforming, and cultivating new people with communist ideas. He pointed out that the socialist cultural revolution can only be successfully completed with the active participation of the broad masses of working people.

	In his speech, Hendrych pointed out that scientists should absorb the experience created by the people and summarize and promote their experience. Literary and art workers must live among the masses and become a member of the millions of working people. Only in this way can socialist literature and art be created, and can great, authentic, and militant works be created.

	Hendrych pointed out that today, class struggle still exists in Czechoslovakia, and international capitalism is still launching attacks against us. We must conduct an irreconcilable struggle against various bourgeois ideas and revisionist ideas, and maintain high vigilance in the ideological struggle.

	At the afternoon session, Zhao Yimin, the Chinese representative, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and director of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, spoke. He first expressed warm congratulations to the congress on behalf of Chinese cultural workers. He said that under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Czechoslovak people are advancing towards the grand goal of completing socialist construction. This congress is a major step in rapidly developing socialist construction and cultural undertakings. There is no doubt that through this congress, Czechoslovak cultural workers will achieve even greater achievements in serving the socialist cause, in strengthening unity based on the Marxist-Leninist worldview, and in strengthening ties with the working people.

    必须用共产主义思想培育新人
    赵毅敏代表我文化工作者向大会致贺
    新华社布拉格9日电　捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文化代表大会9日继续开会，进行讨论。由费林格、亨德里赫、柯别茨基、考茨基、尼耶德利等人组成的捷共中央和捷民族阵线中央代表团出席了这一天的会议。
    亨德里赫在上午的会议上讲话时说，捷共中央把这次大会的召开看作是文化工作者决心同工农群众并肩为实现捷共第十一次代表大会所提出的任务而战斗的表现。
    他说，实现人们思想领域中的社会主义革命是社会主义文化革命的主要内容。捷克斯洛伐克整个文化战线应该积极帮助党完成用共产主义思想教育、改造和培养新人的这个极端重要的任务。他指出，只有在广大劳动人民群众积极参加之下社会主义文化革命才能胜利完成。
    亨德里赫在发言中指出，科学家们应吸取人民群众所创造的经验，总结和推广他们的经验。文学艺术家们必须生活在群众中，成为千百万劳动人民中的一员。只有这样才能创造出社会主义的文学和艺术，才能创作出伟大的真实的富有战斗性的作品。
    亨德里赫指出，今天，在捷克斯洛伐克阶级斗争仍然存在，国际资本主义也还在发动着对我们的进攻，我们应对各种资产阶级思想、修正主义思想进行不调和的斗争，保持在思想斗争中的高度警惕。
    在下午会议上，中国代表、中共中央候补委员、中国人民对外文化协会理事赵毅敏讲了话。他首先代表中国文化工作者向大会表示热烈的祝贺，他说，捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下正向着完成社会主义建设的宏伟目标前进。这次大会正是迅速发展社会主义建设和文化事业的重大步骤，毫无疑问，通过这次大会，捷克斯洛伐克文化工作者将在为社会主义事业服务方面，在加强以马克思列宁主义的世界观为基础的团结方面，以及在加强和劳动人民的联系方面获得更加重大的成就。
