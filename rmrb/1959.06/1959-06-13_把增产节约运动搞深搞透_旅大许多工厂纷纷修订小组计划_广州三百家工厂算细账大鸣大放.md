    Deepen and Thoroughly Implement the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
    Many Factories in Lüda Are Revising Group Plans
    300 Factories in Guangzhou Are Calculating Accounts Carefully and Engaging in Full Airing of Views
    (Our report) The many production groups of factories and mining enterprises in Lüda are formulating and revising their comprehensive increase production and practice economy targets and measures, so that the increase production and practice economy movement is further deepened.
    After recently discussing the increase production and practice economy plan, the workers of the Youth No. 2 Red Flag Furnace of the Dalian Steel Plant put forward new steel production targets. They want to increase the utilization coefficient of cold-charged electric furnaces from the current 39.222 tons to 43.636 tons, and produce 2,167 tons more steel than the national plan for the whole year; the qualification rate will be increased from 99.1% to 99.5%. They will also increase the steel convergence rate, reducing the iron material used per ton of steel from the current 1,099 kg to 1,095 kg, which can save the country 94,564 kg of iron material by the end of the year. In terms of life, they will carry forward the spirit of hard work and simplicity, save an average of 20 yuan per person per month, save 1.5 feet of cloth per year, and save 2 jin of grain per month.
    The riveters and welders of the Dalian General Machinery Plant, who have always paid attention to saving, checked the group's increase production and practice economy plan. Although they saved more than 50 tons of materials from January to May this year, they felt that it was still far from enough and decided that each person would save 10 tons of materials for the whole year.
    The increase production and practice economy target proposed by the workers of the Xu Richang group of the Beishan Pit of Huatonggou Copper Mine is: to increase production by 875 tons of ore per person by the end of the year, and to achieve no material requisition by adopting methods such as digging, searching, and repairing by themselves. Their group organized their families to plant three acres of vegetable fields and raised twenty-six chicks, achieving half self-sufficiency in vegetables.
    The Sun Siyong group of the Western Automobile Repair Plant of Lüda Transportation Company, the Red Glow Shock Brigade of the Second Construction Engineering Company of Lüda, and the Gu Lilu group of the Jinzhou Textile Factory have also revised new increase production and practice economy targets and measures, expressing their willingness to take active actions to deepen and thoroughly implement the increase production and practice economy movement.
    Now, many group workers have turned the increase production and practice economy plan into practical actions, and a new atmosphere has emerged in production and life.
    (Our report) A mass-based high tide of airing of views in the increase production and practice economy movement, centered on strengthening enterprise management, improving product quality, and ensuring production safety, is currently forming in 319 factories in Guangzhou. According to the deployment of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the first stage of carrying out the movement, the leading cadres of each factory are required to start by summarizing production work, explain the purpose and significance of the movement to the masses, and take the lead in exposing problems existing in production. Many factories have conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Municipal Party Committee's instructions, going deep to explain the situation to the masses and eliminating their concerns. Many factories have also used methods such as calculating detailed accounts of waste and holding increase production and practice economy exhibitions and quality exhibitions to conduct in-depth ideological mobilization work and guide the masses to deeply air their views. For example, the Donghua Machinery Factory in the East District held a small exhibition with physical objects as the main content and pictures as auxiliary, put out accumulated materials and defective products for analysis, so that everyone further realized the importance of strengthening enterprise management for carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement.
    In order to make the airing of views deep and thorough, many factories have also adopted various airing methods combined with their own actual conditions, such as thematic airing, joint airing, and consultation airing, all of which have achieved great results. For example, the quality of the dyeing and finishing department of the Lianhua Cloth Factory was not good, so the leadership organized the workers in the related processes of spinning and weaving to conduct a consultation on the problems existing in the production of the dyeing and finishing department; everyone pointed out problems such as the unsound operating system of the dyeing and finishing department, uneven dyeing, and poor yarn boiling, which made the workers in the department realize the shortcomings of their own work and formulate operating procedures based on the existing problems to overcome the phenomenon of declining quality.

    把增产节约运动搞深搞透
    旅大许多工厂纷纷修订小组计划
    广州三百家工厂算细账大鸣大放
    本报讯　旅大市各厂矿企业许多生产小组纷纷制订和修改小组全面增产节约指标和措施，使增产节约运动更加深入。
    大连钢厂青年二号红旗炉工人在最近讨论了增产节约计划以后，提出了新的夺钢指标。他们要把冷装电炉利用系数由现在的三十九点二二二吨提高到四十三点六三六吨，全年要比国家计划多产两千一百六十七吨钢；合格率由99.1％提高到99.5％。他们还要提高钢的收合率，从现在每吨钢用铁料一千零九十九公斤，减少到一千零九十五公斤，到年末可为国家节约铁料九万四千五百六十四公斤。在生活上，他们要发扬艰苦朴素的风气，每人每月平均储蓄二十元，全年节约布一点五尺，每月节约粮食二斤。
    一贯注意节约的大连通用机器厂铆焊车间现图工人检查了小组增产节约计划。他们从今年1月到5月虽然节约了五十多吨材料，但是他们觉得还很不够，决定今年每人全年节约十吨材料。
    华铜沟铜矿北山坑徐日昌小组工人提出的增产节约指标是：到年底每人要增产八百七十五吨矿石，采取挖找代和自己修理等办法，做到不领料。他们小组把家属组织起来种了三亩菜地，养了二十六只小鸡，蔬菜达到半自给。
    旅大运输公司西部汽车修配厂孙思永小组，旅大第二建筑工程公司红霞突击队、金州纺织厂顾立禄小组等也都修订出新的增产节约指标和措施，表示要用积极行动把增产节约运动搞深搞透。
    现在，许多小组工人已把增产节约计划变成实际行动，在生产和生活上已出现了一片新气象。
    本报讯　一个群众性的以加强企业管理、提高产品质量、保证生产安全为中心的增产节约运动鸣放高潮，目前正在广州市三百一十九家工厂中形成。根据中共广州市委的部署，在开展运动的第一阶段中，要求各个工厂领导干部首先要从总结生产工作入手，向群众讲清运动的目的、意义，带头揭露生产上存在的问题。许多工厂都认真贯彻市委指示的精神，深入向群众交底，消除群众的顾虑。许多工厂还运用算浪费细账，举办增产节约展览会、质量展览会等形式，深入地进行思想发动工作，引导群众鸣深放透。如东区东华机器厂以实物为主、图片为辅，举行小型展览会，把积压物资和废次品都摆出来，进行分析，使大家进一步认识到加强企业管理，对开展增产节约运动的重要性。
    不少工厂为了使鸣放进行得深透，还结合本厂实际情况，采用了多种多样的鸣放方式，如专题鸣放、联合鸣放、会诊鸣放等，都收到了很大的效果。如联华布厂漂染部的质量不好，领导上就组织了打纱、织布等有关工序的职工，对漂染部门生产上存在的问题进行会诊；大家摆出漂染部操作制度不健全，染色有深有浅，煮纱不好等问题，使该部门职工认识本身工作的缺点，并根据存在的问题制定了操作规程，克服质量下降的现象。（附图片）
