Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th. The ten thousand mu of continuous dryland wheat in the Dengzhuang People's Commune in Linfen County, Shanxi, achieved a large-scale, high-yield bumper harvest. The entire 10,030 mu of high-yield fields yielded an average of 403 jin and two liang per mu after actual harvesting and threshing, of which 100 mu yielded 703 jin per mu.

The Dengzhuang Commune has always been considered a low-yielding area with drought in nine out of ten years. This year's ability to achieve a bumper wheat harvest is the result of comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and vigorously promoting past small-area high-yield experiences. Before planting wheat last autumn, the commune's Party committee organized a mass discussion throughout the commune to study whether dryland wheat could further increase production and how to increase production. During the discussion, many advanced yield-increasing experiences suitable to local characteristics were discovered. For example, in 1956, Beiliang Village had ten mu of wheat with a yield of 600 jin per mu, and the entire village's 750 mu of wheat yielded 300 jin per mu. The main yield-increasing experiences of this village were: using floodwater for irrigation, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and implementing rational close planting, etc. Based on these high-yield experiences, the commune Party committee formulated technical measures to strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year, and designated 10,000 mu of contiguous land as high-yield fields, striving for large-area high yields. From the beginning of wheat planting, the production teams responsible for planting this high-yield area launched enthusiastic competitions, so the wheat fields in the high-yield area all met the requirements of deep plowing, applying more fertilizer, and sowing all "Bima No. 1" improved varieties and implementing rational close planting. In the management of wheat fields, all production teams, in view of the lack of water sources in dryland, adopted the method of applying chemical fertilizer and human manure mixed with water, which not only fertilized the fields but also helped to preserve moisture.

    小面积增产经验结出大面积丰收硕果
    万亩连片旱地喜报小麦高产
    临汾邓庄公社一万零三十亩亩产四百零三斤
    新华社太原28日电　山西临汾县邓庄人民公社万亩连片旱地小麦丰产方获得了大面积高额丰产。全丰产方一万零三十亩小麦，经实收实打，平均亩产四百零三斤二两，其中有一百亩亩产七百零三斤。
    邓庄公社一向被人们认为是十年九旱的低产地区，今年能够获得小麦大丰收，是全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，大力推广以往小面积丰产经验的结果。去秋种麦前，公社党委在全社范围内，组织了一个全民性的大讨论，研究旱地小麦能不能进一步增产和如何增产的问题。在讨论中，许多适合当地特点的先进增产经验被发掘出来了。例如北凉村在1956年有十亩小麦亩产六百斤，全村七百五十亩小麦亩产三百斤。这个村的主要增产经验是：利用洪水浇地，施足底肥和实行合理密植等。公社党委根据这些丰产经验，订出了争取今年小麦丰产的技术措施，并且划出一万亩连片土地作为丰产方，力争大面积高产。从种麦开始，负责种植这块丰产方的各生产队，就展开了热烈的竞赛，因而丰产方中的麦田都达到了深耕、多施肥和全部播种“碧蚂一号”良种以及实行合理密植的要求。在麦田管理中，各生产队都针对旱地水源缺乏的情况，采取化肥、人粪掺水追施的办法，既肥了田，又有利于保墒。
