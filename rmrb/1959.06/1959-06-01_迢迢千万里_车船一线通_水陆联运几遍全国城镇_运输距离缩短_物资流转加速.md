    Thousands of Miles, Connected by a Single Line of Vehicles and Ships
    Water-Land Intermodal Transport Covers Towns and Cities Nationwide, Shortening Transport Distances and Accelerating Material Circulation

    (Our dispatch) Currently, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways are jointly operating water-land intermodal transport, with eighteen ports along the coast and the Yangtze River engaged in this business. This has played a certain role in promoting the rational transport of materials, shortening transport distances, and accelerating material circulation.

    After the implementation of water-land intermodal transport, long-distance land transportation has been avoided, alleviating the railways' heavy transportation burden to some extent. After grain from Sichuan supplied to the northeastern provinces, and steel from the northeast supplied to Chongqing, were included in the scope of water-land intermodal transport, according to statistics from April this year, the average transport distance was shortened by ten kilometers due to the rational arrangement of transport routes. Moreover, the transportation procedures are simple, saving transportation costs. Once the goods are shipped, only one freight bill is used to the end, and preferential treatment can be given in terms of freight, reducing the charging standard by 15%. Rice transported from Chongqing to Shenyang using water-land intermodal transport saves six yuan per ton in freight compared to direct railway transport. Steel billets transported from Lingshan in the Northeast to Chongqing save eight yuan per ton, and cotton yarn transported from Shanghai to Chengdu using water-land intermodal transport saves as much as twenty-two yuan per ton. Due to the opening of water-land intermodal transport, the river-sea-river intermodal transport that water transport enterprises had already organized has played a role on a larger scale. The water-land intermodal transport and river-sea-river intermodal transport business, and the port agency's cargo transit business operated by seven ports along the northern coast, such as Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Yantai, and Shanghai, account for a large proportion. At present, this kind of intermodal transport material passing through the northern coastal route accounts for more than 80% of the total cargo transportation volume.

    The opening of intermodal transport has greatly improved the service quality of the transportation department for consignment work and expanded the service scope. Because the railway department stipulates that all stations that handle full-car and less-than-carload cargo transportation become stations for handling water-land intermodal transport; also, because the ports on the Yangtze River route that handle water-land intermodal transport, such as Chongqing, Wanxian, Yichang, Hankou, Huangshi, Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Tianshenggang, are connected to local inland rivers, and have organized water-land and river-sea-river intermodal transport, therefore, water-land intermodal transport business has almost spread to cities and towns on transportation lines across the country. The current problems are that the port's loading and unloading capacity for continuing to ship goods by changing transportation tools is insufficient, the cargo transfer is not timely enough, and the capacity of the Yangtze River trunk line is insufficient, which affects the continued expansion of intermodal transport business. At the same time, it is also necessary to further strengthen cooperation between the consigning and carrier departments. Therefore, the transportation department is continuing to study and actively improve its work, so that the national water-land intermodal transport business can be better developed.

    迢迢千万里　车船一线通
    水陆联运几遍全国城镇　运输距离缩短　物资流转加速
    本报讯　交通部同铁道部共同举办的水陆联运，目前沿海及长江航线已有十八个港口经营了这种业务。这对于促进物资合理运输，缩短物资运输距离，加速物资流转，都起了一定的作用。
    推行了水陆联运业务以后，避免了长距离的陆上运输，在一定程度上减轻了铁路过重的运输任务。从四川供应东北各省的粮食，以及从东北地区供应重庆的钢材，纳入水陆联运范围以后，根据今年4月份的统计，由于合理安排运输线路，使它的平均运输距离缩短了十公里。而且运输手续简便，节省运输费用，货物一经起运，只用一张货票凭用到底，在运费上可按规定优待，减低收费标准15％。由重庆运到沈阳的大米，利用水陆联运，比铁路直达运输每吨节省运费六元，从东北灵山运往重庆的钢坯，每吨节约运费八元，从上海运往成都去的棉纱利用水陆联运，每吨也节省运费达二十二元之多。由于水陆联运业务的开办，使水运企业原来早已举办的江海河联运，在更大的范围内发挥了作用。北洋沿海如大连、秦皇岛、天津、青岛、连云港、烟台、上海等七个港口所经营的水陆联运业务以及江海河联运业务和港口代办货物中途转运业务，已占很大的比重。目前在北洋沿海航线上所通过的这种联运物资，约占全部货物运输量的80％以上。
    开办联运业务，大大改进了运输部门对托运工作的服务质量，扩大了服务范围。由于铁路方面规定，凡是办理整车和零担货物运输的车站，都成为举办水陆联运的车站；还由于长江航线举办水陆联运的港口如重庆、万县、宜昌、汉口、黄石、安庆、九江、芜湖、南京、镇江、天生港等十一个港都同地方内河相联接，举办了水陆和江海河联运，因此，目前水陆联运业务，几乎已遍布全国各交通线城市和城镇。目前的问题是，港口对于货物改换运输工具继续发运的装卸能力不足，货物换装不够及时，江海干线运力不足等，影响了联运业务的继续扩大。同时，托运与承运部门之间，也还需要进一步加强协作。因此，交通部门正在继续研究并积极改进工作，以便使全国水陆联运业务更好地开展起来。（附图片）
