Singing the Praises of Democratic Reform's Victory: A Bumper Harvest of Wheat and Soybeans Spreads Fragrance for Miles; The Yi People of Xiaoliang Mountains Soar Towards Socialism

(Report from our correspondent Tian Lianggeng) Having cast off the shackles of slavery, the Yi people of Xiaoliang Mountains in Yunnan are leaping forward towards a happy and prosperous socialist transition.

Crossing the Jinsha River and climbing the Xiaoliang Mountains, one sees the fragrance of ripe wheat and soybeans spreading for miles. This year's spring crops, planted on a large scale for the first time by the Yi people, are about to yield an unprecedented harvest. During the Great Leap Forward last year, tens of thousands of Yi people braved the bitter cold to dig ditches and canals on the steep cliffs where even monkeys struggle to climb, transforming the land into paddy fields. Now, over 30,000 mu of paddy fields have appeared in the mountainous areas over 2,000 meters above sea level, once haunted by jackals and wolves. With the help of Han cadres and the instruction of other experienced minority farmers, the Yi farmers, who previously did not know how to cultivate paddy fields, are now working side by side with Han farmers, transplanting rice seedlings. Last year, they achieved an average of 800 to 1,000 jin of grain per person. The Yi people, who traditionally subsisted on potatoes year-round, can now eat rice and wheat flour.

Just over a year ago, the silent valleys and high mountains now rumble with machinery, molten iron flows, and electric lights shine. More than fifty farms in the Xiaoliang Mountains region have established dozens of factories and workshops for iron smelting, machinery, copper, asbestos, and non-staple food processing. More than a thousand liberated slaves have become workers and junior technicians.

Every evening, when the bright moon hangs in the sky, the liberated Yi people, some playing with their beloved chubby babies, others opening their hearts, sing in the characteristic high-pitched tones of the mountain people: "The flowers of spring have bloomed, the democratic reform has been victorious; the working people stand up like high mountains, the people's communes are established like stars."

The Xiaoliang Mountains of Yunnan and the Daliang Mountains of Sichuan are the main areas where the Yi people of our country live. The area north of the Jinsha River in Yunnan is the Xiaoliang Mountains, with more than 56,000 Yi people. Only two years ago, the Xiaoliang Mountains region was still a slave society, and the current farm members were living the lives of slaves, treated like cattle and horses. The Yi people here are divided into two classes: the Black Yi and the White Yi. The Black Yi were the ruling class, mostly slave owners, while the vast majority of the White Yi were reduced to slaves. With the exception of a few slave owners and some free people, more than 26,000 people were slaves and 15,000 were serfs. Slaves not only belonged to the slave owners themselves, but their children were also slaves. Slave owners enjoyed absolute control over slaves, and could drive them at will, sell them at will, and slaughter them at will. At night, slave owners chained the slaves with iron chains or wooden shackles. They lay in rows on the ground, unable to even turn over. At dawn, the slave owners whipped the slaves and drove them to the fields to engage in the most primitive and arduous labor with the most primitive tools. The slave owners used whips to order the slaves to exert their last ounce of strength to work, but they could only eat potatoes, buckwheat husks, and the leftovers from the slave owners' meals. The "feuds" and vendettas instigated by the slave owners between various tribes led to the deaths or disabilities of many slaves. Xiaoliang Mountains was filled with blood, tears, hatred, and desolation. A Yi folk song says, "Slaves are not human beings, the Liang Mountains do not produce grain."

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the Yi people overthrew the barbaric slave society. Peaceful land reform began in October 1956 and was successfully completed in March 1958.

According to the wishes of the Yi people, nearly 2,400 people who had been abducted from neighboring counties and Sichuan Province by slave owners and forced into slavery were helped by the government to return to their hometowns and reunite with their families. Those who had relationships as husband and wife, father and son, or sisters were helped to rebuild their homes, and more than 6,600 homeless people were also settled with the help of the government.

In order to organize the liberated slaves for production and life, and thus rapidly transition to socialism, the local Party committee conducted investigations and research among the first batch of liberated slaves. Based on the fact that they had only single labor skills and lacked the ability to engage in production and life independently due to being driven by slave owners for many years, they adopted the method of collective ownership of the means of production, which was a type of farm that was different from state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives. In the first year of running the farms, universal harvests were achieved. For example, the Xibu River Farm was composed of 256 liberated slaves. Last year, led by the district Party secretary, they came to the river valley, "where only monkeys can be seen, not people," drove away jackals and leopards, built new villages with their hands and hoes, and reclaimed more than 400 mu of rice fields and nearly 300 mu of corn and potato fields along the banks. They also dug ditches, cleared roads, and built bridges. The quiet river valley suddenly became thriving and bustling. Last year, the average income per person was more than 1,000 jin of grain, as well as more than 40 jin of rapeseed and peanuts, as well as pigs and chickens. Sixty-six single men got married. The joy and excitement of the liberated slaves cannot be described in words. They sang, "The yellow grain of the Xibu River shines brightly, the grain of Wangjiang Valley is sweet in our hearts; labor creates a paradise on earth, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are our parents."

The children of the slaves have the opportunity to go to school, and currently more than 800 people are studying in primary and secondary schools in various places. Many health clinics have also been established in the Xiaoliang Mountains, and medical personnel sent by the Party often travel around regardless of mountain barriers to provide free treatment for the Yi people. Now, the Yi people are striding forward towards socialism, and have issued the bold statement: "We are two thousand years behind the interior, and we will also work hard to catch up in a few years!"

    高歌民主改革获胜利　但见麦黄豆熟十里香
    小凉山彝族飞向社会主义
    本报讯　记者田良耕报道：挣脱奴隶锁链的云南小凉山彝族人民正飞跃地向幸福美好的社会主义过渡。
    越过金沙江，攀上小凉山，但见麦黄豆熟十里香。今年彝族人民第一次大面积种植的小春作物就要空前丰收。在去年大跃进中，数万彝族人民冒着严寒，在猿猴难上的悬崖绝壁开沟挖渠，引水改田。现在，原是豺狼出没的、海拔两千多公尺的山区出现了三万多亩水田。经汉族干部的帮助和其他有经验的少数民族农民的传授，彝族原来不懂种水田技术的农民，现在也和汉族农民一起并肩插秧。他们去年实现了每人有粮八百到一千斤，素来终年以洋芋为主食的彝族人民，现在也能吃上大米和麦面了。
    就在一年多以前，还是沉寂的峡谷和高山上，现已机声隆隆、铁水奔流，电灯闪烁着光芒，小凉山地区五十多个农场已兴办了炼铁、机械、铜、石棉、副食品加工等几十座工厂和作坊；一千多名解放了的奴隶已当了工人和初级技术员。
    每当傍晚，皓月当空的时候，解放了的彝族人民，有的逗着心爱的胖娃，有的放开胸怀，以山民特有的高亢声调歌唱：“春天的花开了，民主改革胜利了；劳动人民像高山一样站起来了，人民公社像星星一样成立起来了。”
    云南小凉山和四川大凉山是我国彝族人民的主要聚居区。江以北云南境内是小凉山，有五万六千多彝族人民。仅在两年以前，小凉山地区还是奴隶社会，现在的农场场员们还是过着牛马生活的奴隶。这里的彝族分黑彝白彝两系，黑彝是统治阶级，多为奴隶主；白彝绝大多数沦为奴隶。除少数奴隶主和一部分自由民以外，有二万六千多人是奴隶，有一万五千人是农奴。奴隶不仅自身属于奴隶，他们的子女也是奴隶。奴隶主对待奴隶享有一切绝对的支配权，可以任意驱使，任意出卖，任意屠杀。夜晚，奴隶主将奴隶用铁链条或木制的枷锁拴住。他们成排地躺在地下，连翻个身都不可能。黎明奴隶主用皮鞭把奴隶赶起，驱使他们到田间用最原始的工具从事最笨重的劳动。奴隶主用鞭子喝令奴隶拿出最后的一点一滴力气干活，却只能吃些洋芋、苦荞皮和奴隶主吃喝剩下的残汤。奴隶主策动的各部落之间的“打冤家”的仇杀械斗，使许多奴隶丧命或造成残废小凉山充满了血泪、仇恨和荒凉。一首彝族的歌谣说，“奴隶不是人，凉山不生谷”。
    解放以后，彝族人民在党的领导下，推翻了野蛮的奴隶社会。从1956年10月开始和平土改，到1958年3月胜利完成。
    根据彝族人民的要求，被奴隶主从邻县和四川等地抢来强迫当奴隶的近二千四百人，由政府帮助他们还乡和亲人团聚。有夫妻、父子姐妹等关系的则帮助他们重建家园，无家可归的六千六百多人也在政府帮助下安家。
    为了组织解放了的奴隶进行生产和生活，从而迅速地向社会主义过渡，当地党委在第一批解放出来的奴隶中进行了调查研究，根据他们长年在奴隶主驱使下，只有单一的劳动技能，缺乏独立从事生产、生活的能力等情况，采取了生产资料完全归集体所有的办法，即不同于国营农场又不同于农业合作社的一种农场　在办农场的第一年中，就获得了普遍丰收。如西布河畔农场，是由二百五十六个解放了的奴隶组成的。他们去年由区委书记率领，来到“只见猴子不见人”的河谷地区，赶走豺豹，用双手和锄头建起新村，在沿岸开垦出四百多亩稻田和近三百亩包谷、洋芋地，并开沟、劈路和筑桥，寂静的河谷顿时欣欣向荣，人声鼎沸。去年，每人平均收入粮食一千多斤，还有油菜和花生四十多斤，以及猪、鸡等。六十六个单身汉结了婚。解放了的奴隶们，其欢欣鼓舞之情，是无法用言语形容的。他们歌唱道：“西布河黄谷放光芒，望江谷子心里甜；劳动创造人间天堂，毛主席共产党是爹娘。”
    奴隶的子女们有了上学的机会，目前八百多人正在各地小学和中学里读书。小凉山上还建立起许多卫生所，党派来的医务人员经常不顾山川阻隔，各处巡回，为彝族人民免费治疗。现在彝族人民正昂首阔步向社会主义迈进，并发出豪言壮语说：“我们比内地落后两千年，也要鼓足干劲在几年内赶上！”（附图片）
