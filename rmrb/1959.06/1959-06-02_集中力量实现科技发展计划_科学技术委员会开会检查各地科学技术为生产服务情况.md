Xinhua News Agency, 31st: The State Science and Technology Commission convened a meeting of local science and technology commission leaders from May 18th to 23rd to inspect the situation of science and technology work serving production and construction in various regions over the past few months, and to deploy the main tasks of current science and technology work, that is, how to better organize the implementation of the already compiled science and technology development plan.

From the reports of the heads of the science and technology commissions of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions attending the meeting, it can be seen that: Generally, all regions have placed projects serving production and construction in the primary position of the science and technology development plan. Many Party and government leading cadres of scientific research units have personally visited relevant factories and mines, and jointly compiled research topics with enterprise personnel to meet the needs of production development. The Shanghai Materials Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, through visits, put forward more than 100 research topics that factories and enterprises urgently need to solve. Many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have put forward research topics based on the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, such as researching and summarizing comprehensive cultivation techniques for high-yield and large-area high-yield agriculture, and have proposed research on improving the smelting technology of newly built small blast furnaces, desulfurizing pig iron, improving steel quality, technically transforming small steel industrial bases, and using other types of coal to refine high-quality metallurgical coke in areas lacking coking coal in the metallurgical industry. All of these and other similar issues are closely related to current production and construction. Further solutions and improvements to these problems through scientific research can promote the further development of industrial and agricultural production and the further improvement of the scientific and technological level of industry and agriculture.

From the reports, it can be seen that when implementing the policy of science and technology serving production and construction, all regions generally attach great importance to combining local characteristics and local natural resource conditions to formulate science and technology development plans. Inner Mongolia has a large proportion of animal husbandry production, so they regard scientific research in animal husbandry as one of the key points of scientific research in the region, and put forward research on grassland improvement, livestock being full of fat, full of pregnancy, and multi-birth, increasing livestock products, local livestock breeds and the effect of hybrid improvement, and improving current livestock diagnosis and treatment methods, and research on their technical measures and theories. Guangdong Province, based on its natural resources, attaches great importance to the research of rubber and other tropical and subtropical crops. Sichuan and Xinjiang attach importance to the distribution laws of oil fields, new petroleum exploration and exploitation methods, and the research of new varieties and technologies for petroleum refining. This approach has won the support of the masses.

How to quickly implement the research projects in the plan, especially many research projects that urgently need to be solved in production, and organize the supply of research equipment and materials, is very important. All regions paid attention to emphasizing this issue when compiling plans. Shanghai has listed the types, specifications, and quantities of the main materials required for important scientific research projects. In the process of organizing the implementation of the plan, they listed all the materials needed for key projects and took the initiative to negotiate with relevant departments to solve the problems. Generally, scientific research equipment and materials have been included in the national economic plan. Many places have established scientific product supply service offices, which have played a good role in supplying equipment and materials. Practice has proved that this is a feasible organizational form for providing scientific research equipment in a more planned way, which is worth referring to and applying in various regions according to their own needs and possible conditions.

The meeting studied the existing problems in current science and technology work, and believed that the use of research power was not concentrated enough, there were some unnecessary duplications in research projects in various regions, the indicators of some projects in the plan were too high, too broad, and too urgent, basic theoretical research work lacked specific arrangements, and there was also a phenomenon of omissions of individual important projects.

In view of the work situation in various regions in recent months, the meeting proposed that the main task at present is to concentrate efforts to organize the implementation of the plan. In particular, projects related to the four major indicators this year and those urgently needed for current production and construction should be given top priority. The meeting pointed out that local science and technology commissions must do the following work in the next few months: First, grasp the inspection of the plan and the coordination of tasks. In terms of inspection, many provinces and cities such as Hunan, Sichuan, and Tianjin have good experience. Tianjin City once formed a key project inspection team composed of the Science and Technology Commission, the Scientific Products Service Office, and the Science Association to inspect 224 industrial and transportation projects, and found problems such as the inability to queue up for equipment processing. Therefore, it is possible to re-queue and solve the problems according to their size. In terms of coordination, many provinces and cities such as the three northeastern provinces, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Gansu, Sichuan, and Hunan also have good experience. The three northeastern provinces once held a meeting to discuss the division of labor and cooperation in the research projects, scientific and technological information, the training of scientific and technological cadres, and the materials needed for scientific research institutes in the implementation of the 1959 science and technology development plan, and drafted detailed lists of collaborative opinions and division of labor collaboration projects for the scientific and technological research projects of the three provinces. In order to make our scientific and technological power truly become a collective force and play a greater role, it is necessary to implement extensive cooperation based on existing collaborative experience and actual needs. We must participate in this cooperation with a high degree of communist spirit.

Second, grasp the appraisal and promotion of scientific research results. The purpose of scientific research is to apply the results to production and turn research results into production results. The number of scientific research results last year was very large, and more research results will be produced this year. These results need to be promoted and applied to production in a timely manner. For example, among the 2,628 research and trial production projects completed by the scientific research units of the central industrial ministries stationed in Shanghai in 1958, 1,091 have been used in production, accounting for 41.5% of the completed projects. In Tianjin, 45% of the projects completed last year have been promoted. This means that the promotion work has generally attracted attention. However, turning research results into production results requires a lot of solid work. The Ministry of Chemical Industry recently summarized this issue. They believe that a series of scientific and technological work from research results to production results is complete and has a certain proportional relationship. We should take a certain task as the center, and conduct comprehensive research and appropriate arrangements from resources and raw materials to finished products, from experimental research and intermediate experiments to promotion and use, from technological processes to equipment manufacturing, and from technical possibilities to economic rationality. Among them, appraisal is one of the important links. It is dangerous to promote research results on a large scale without appraisal. In this regard, Tianjin, Sichuan, Heilongjiang and other places have some good experience. For example, Tianjin once appraised 35 important new products last year. As a result, it was fully confident to confirm that 23 items could be put into production or promoted, and clarified the problems and future efforts for the rest that still need further research. The significance of appraising research results is not only limited to promotion, but also greatly promotes the development of scientific and technological work itself. In Tianjin, some technical direction problems that have not been resolved for a long time have been resolved through appraisal, and different views and opinions have been debated. Therefore, the meeting believed that in the next few months, it is of great practical significance for all regions to focus on a batch of research results for serious appraisal and actively promote them.

At the beginning and end of the meeting, Han Guang, Vice Chairman of the State Science and Technology Commission, spoke successively on the science and technology development plan this year, concentrating efforts, appropriately shortening the front line of local science and technology work, and the ideology and study of scientific and technological workers. On the issue of ideology and study of scientific and technological workers, Comrade Han Guang said that attention should be paid to uniting scientific and technological personnel, uniting all new and old experts in scientific and technological work positions, and better giving play to their roles, so that they can boldly carry out creative work under the leadership of the Party. At the same time, we must advocate a pragmatic attitude. Scientific and technological workers should strive to study and delve into professional knowledge and scientific knowledge, better shoulder the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state, and strive to complete the science and technology development plan.

    集中力量实现科技发展计划
    科学技术委员会开会检查各地科学技术为生产服务情况
    新华社31日讯　国家科学技术委员会在5月18日到23日召开地方科委负责人会议，检查过去几个月来各地科学技术工作为生产建设服务的情况，并就当前科学技术工作的主要任务，即如何更好地组织已经编制的科学技术发展计划的实现，作了部署。
    从参加会议的各省、市、自治区科委负责人的汇报中可以看出：各地一般都已把为生产建设服务的项目，列在科学技术发展计划的首要地位。许多科学研究单位的党、政领导干部，曾亲自到有关厂矿进行访问，和企业人员共同编定研究课题，以适应生产发展的需要。第一机械工业部上海材料研究所通过访问，就提出了各工厂企业急待解决的一百多个研究课题。许多省、市、自治区提出了根据农业生产八字宪法，研究总结农业高产、大面积丰产的综合栽培技术等等农业方面的研究课题，提出了研究提高新建小高炉的冶炼技术、生铁脱硫，提高钢铁质量，从技术上改造小型钢铁工业基地，在缺炼焦煤地区以其他煤种炼优质冶金焦等等冶金工业方面的课题，所有这些和其它更多的类似的问题，都是结合当前生产建设最为密切的问题。这些问题通过科学研究获得进一步解决和提高，就可以促进工农业生产的进一步发展，工农业科学技术水平的进一步提高。
    从汇报可以看出，各地在执行科学技术为生产建设服务的方针时，一般都十分重视结合地方特点和地方自然资源条件，来编制科学技术发展计划。内蒙古畜牧业生产的比重很大，他们就把畜牧业方面的科学研究工作作为该区科学研究的重点之一，提出了研究草原改良，家畜满膘、满怀和多胎多产，增加畜产品，家畜地方品种及杂交改良效果，改进现行家畜诊断治疗方法等课题，研究它们的技术措施和理论。广东省根据本省自然资源，十分重视橡胶和其他热带、亚热带作物的研究，四川、新疆重视油田分布规律、新的石油勘探和开采方法、石油炼制的新品种新技术的研究。这种做法获得了广大群众的拥护和支持。
    如何使计划中的研究项目，特别是许多生产上急待解决的研究项目能够迅速落实，组织好研究用的器材和设备的供应，是很重要的。各地在编制计划时注意强调了这个问题。上海市重要科学研究项目都列上所需主要材料的品种、规格和数量。在组织计划实现过程中，他们又把所有重点项目所需的材料列出清单，主动和有关部门协商解决。一般都把科学研究用的器材、设备列入了国民经济计划。许多地方建立了科学用品供应服务处，对供应器材和设备起了良好的作用。实践证明，这是一个比较有计划地提供科学研究器材的可行的组织形式，值得各地根据本身的需要和可能条件，参考运用。
    会议研究了目前科学技术工作方面还存在的问题，认为研究力量的使用还不够集中，各地研究项目有某些不必要的重复，计划中某些项目的指标偏高、偏宽、偏急，基础理论研究工作还缺乏具体的安排，也还有遗漏个别重要项目的现象。
    针对数月来各地工作情况，会议提出当前的主要任务是集中力量组织计划的实现。特别是与今年四大指标有关的和当前生产建设迫切需要的项目，应该放在首要地位。会议指出，各地科委在今后几个月内，必需做好下列工作：一、抓计划的检查和任务的协调。在检查方面，湖南、四川、天津等很多省市已有较好的经验。天津市曾由科委、科学用品服务处和科协三方面组成重点项目检查组，对二百二十四项工业交通项目进行了检查，发现存在着设备加工排不上队等问题，因而有可能根据问题大小，重新排队解决。在协调工作方面，东北三省、上海、江苏、山东、甘肃、四川、湖南等很多省市，也已有较好的经验。东北三省曾经集会讨论三省在实现1959年科学技术发展计划中有关的研究项目、科学技术资料、科学技术干部的培养和科学研究所需物资等方面的分工协作问题，并拟定了三省科学技术研究项目协作意见及分工协作项目明细表，分工执行。为了使我们的科学技术力量真正成为集体力量，发挥更大作用，有必要根据已有的协作的经验，根据实际的需要，实行广泛的协作。必须以高度共产主义的精神参加这种协作。
    二、抓科学研究成果的鉴定和推广工作。科学研究的目的在于把成果用于生产，把研究成果变为生产成果。去年科学研究成果的数量很多，今年将会产生更多研究成果。这些成果都需要及时推广运用到生产中去，如中央各工业部驻上海的科学研究单位在1958年完成的二千六百二十八个研究试制课题中，已用于生产的有一千零九十一个，占完成数的41.5％。天津市去年完成的课题已推广的占45％。这就是说，推广工作一般已引起注意。但推广研究成果变为生产成果，需要进行许多踏实的工作。化工部最近对这问题进行了总结，他们认为从研究成果到生产成果之间的一系列科学技术工作，有成套性，其中有一定的比例关系。应该以某一任务为中心，从资源、原材料到成品，从试验研究、中间试验到推广使用，从工艺流程到设备制造，从技术上的可能性到经济上的合理性，都要作全面的研究和恰当的安排。其中鉴定工作是重要环节之一。研究成果不进行鉴定就大量推广是危险的。这方面，天津、四川、黑龙江等地都有一些很好的经验。如天津曾经对去年三十五项重要新产品进行了鉴定，结果就有充分把握肯定二十三项可以投入生产或推广，对其余还需作进一步研究的，也明确了问题所在和今后努力方向。鉴定研究成果的意义还不仅限于推广，也大大地促进了科学技术工作本身的发展，天津市有些长期没有得到解决的技术方向问题，通过鉴定，不同的看法和意见展开争辩，得到了解决。因此，会议认为，在今后几个月内，各地重点地抓一批研究成果进行认真的鉴定，并积极予以推广，有重大现实意义。
    在会议开始和结束时，国家科委韩光副主任曾先后就今年科学技术发展计划，集中力量、适当缩短地方科学技术工作战线，以及科学技术工作者的思想和学习等问题讲了话。在科学技术工作者的思想和学习问题上，韩光同志说，要注意团结科学技术人员，团结科学技术工作岗位上的一切新老专家，更好地发挥他们的作用，使他们在党的领导下，大胆地进行创造性工作。同时，必须提倡实事求是的工作态度。科学技术工作人员，要努力学习和钻研业务知识和科学知识，更好地担负起党和国家交给我们的光荣任务，为完成科学技术发展计划而奋斗。
