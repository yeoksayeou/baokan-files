Intercropping in forests has many benefits
Good combination of forestry and agriculture, both nurturing the mountains and producing treasures.
The mountains are green, and the crops are thriving, cultivating forests and harvesting grain.

    林农间作好处多
    林农结合好，养山又出宝。
    山绿庄稼旺，育林又收粮。
              （湖南民歌）
