    The knife sharpener created by workers at the Second Logging Area of the Yuan'an Forestry Area in Hubei Province can sharpen 24 axes or 44 sickles per day, increasing efficiency by eleven times compared to manual sharpening. This knife sharpener has a simple structure, requiring only a few pieces of wood and a round grindstone. A rectangular model is made, with a water tank installed on the front. The axe or sickle can be placed in the tank for sharpening.

    磨刀器
    湖北省远安林区第二伐木场工人创制的磨刀器，每天可磨二十四把斧头或四十四把镰刀，比人工磨刀提高效率十一倍。这种磨刀器构造简单，只需几根木材和一块圆形磨石，做一长方形的模型，正面安一水槽，把斧或镰放在槽中就可以磨了。
