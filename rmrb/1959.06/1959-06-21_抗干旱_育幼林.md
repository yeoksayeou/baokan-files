Drought Resistance: Cultivating Young Forests
    Gansu Provincial Forestry Bureau Afforestation Section

    Xujia Mountain in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, and Chankou in Dingxi are both arid mountainous areas. Xujia Mountain is more than 1,700 meters above sea level, with an annual rainfall of 200 to 300 millimeters; Chankou is 2,100 meters above sea level, with an annual rainfall of 280 to 300 millimeters. The climate is dry, and the soil is loess, making afforestation conditions poor. However, the Xujia Mountain Forest Farm and the Chankou Forest Farm have achieved good results in improving afforestation survival rates and accelerating tree growth by adopting correct technical measures, especially strengthening post-planting management. The poplar trees planted by the Chankou Forest Farm in the autumn of 1957 on Chapai Mountain using the dry planting method, after two hoeings and weeding last year, and combined with land preparation in the autumn, converted the horizontal ditches into terraces with a high outer and low inner slope, and loosened the soil thoroughly once. This spring, the tree height has reached 1.4 meters, and the thickness is 1.5 centimeters. Lanzhou Xujia Mountain started afforestation in 1944, but the saplings did not grow for many years because no management was carried out in the past. After the establishment of the Xujia Mountain Forest Farm in 1955, management was strengthened, and the saplings are growing very well. Their measures are:

    I. Timely Soil Loosening and Weeding. The purpose of soil loosening and weeding is to prevent soil compaction, reduce water evaporation, and prevent weeds from competing with saplings for water and nutrients. The Xujia Mountain Forest Farm loosens the soil and weeds three times a year for saplings. The first time is after rain in April and May, in order to preserve moisture and promote rooting and germination; the second time is in July when weeds are abundant, in order to remove weeds and prevent them from hindering the growth of saplings; the third time is in September and October, in order to preserve autumn moisture and create conditions for growth in the coming year. The Chankou Forest Farm also carries out three times, once in May and June, once after heavy rain during the rainy season, and once after autumn. This soil loosening and weeding expands the nutritional area of ​​the saplings and creates good conditions for growth and development. The two-year-old elm seedlings planted by the Chankou Forest Farm in the autumn of 1957, after two weedings and soil loosening, now have a survival rate of over 80% and are generally up to 60 centimeters high.

    II. Spreading Sand on Forest Land to Conserve Moisture and Resist Drought. This is a method adopted by the Xujia Mountain Forest Farm based on the experience of farmers in the suburbs of Lanzhou in planting sandy fields. According to observations, the ability to conserve moisture and resist drought is greatly enhanced after spreading sand on forest land. Even during the spring drought, the sand and gravel below are still moist. The facts here prove that full sand spreading has the best effect. At the same time, after spreading sand, the soil loosening process can be reduced, and there are fewer weeds, which is a long-term method of conserving moisture and resisting drought in arid areas.

    III. Building Soil Mounds to Protect Seedlings from Frost. The terrain here is high, and wind and frost damage are serious. Newly planted seedlings often grow poorly or even die due to wind and frost damage. In the winter of 1958, the Xujia Mountain Forest Farm adopted the method of building soil mounds to prevent wind and frost, and protected 300,000 seedlings to safely overwinter, with good results. According to observations, the moisture in the buried soil is good, and after digging up the soil mounds, the topsoil is moist, while the topsoil of the unburied soil is dry. According to the practice of the Xujia Mountain Forest Farm, one person can bury 1,000 to 1,500 seedlings per day, and can dig up 1,500 to 2,000 seedlings.

    IV. Pruning Should Be Age-Appropriate and Moderate. In order to facilitate the upward growth of trees and improve the quality of the wood, necessary artificial pruning should also be carried out. However, the factors that determine the growth of trees are not pruning, but soil moisture and nutrients. Therefore, pruning must be age-appropriate and moderate.

    V. Planting Green Manure Crops or Applying Fertilizer to Improve Soil Fertility. Forest land in arid areas is not only dry, but also barren. Therefore, while doing a good job of water storage and moisture conservation, it is also necessary to improve soil fertility. In 1959, the Chankou Forest Farm planned to interplant peas, broad beans and other crops in the rows of saplings, and turn them into the forest land as green manure after flowering to improve soil fertility.

    The experiences of Lanzhou Xujia Mountain and Dingxi Chankou Forest Farms tell us that sapling management is the main measure to create conditions conducive to the growth of saplings, and it is also the main link to consolidate afforestation achievements. Without management, there will be no new forests. Although the sapling management methods they have adopted are not complete enough, and some practices are limited to the specific conditions of the local climate, soil, terrain, and topography and may not be applicable to other regions, and some practices still need to be tested by practice, they undoubtedly have certain reference value for various regions.

    抗干旱　育幼林
    甘肃省林业局造林科
    甘肃兰州徐家山、定西巉口，都是干旱山区。徐家山拔海一千七百多公尺，年降雨量二百至三百公厘；巉口拔海二千一百公尺，年降雨量二百八至三百公厘。气候干燥，土壤都是黄土，造林条件不好。但是，徐家山林场和巉口林场由于采取了正确的技术措施，特别是加强了造林后的抚育工作，在提高造林的成活率、加快林木生长方面，都获得了良好的成果。巉口林场1957年秋在插牌山埋干栽植的杨树，经过去年两次松土除草，秋季又结合整地，将水平沟改成外高内低的平坡梯田，全面松土一次，今春树高已达一点四公尺，粗一公分半。兰州徐家山从1944年开始造林，但因以往没有进行抚育，幼林多年没有生长起来。1955年徐家山林场成立后，加强了抚育工作，幼林生长的很好。他们的措施是：
    一、适时松土除草。松土除草的目的是不让土壤板结，减少水分蒸发，不让杂草和幼林争夺水分、养分。徐家山林场对幼林一年松土除草三次，第一次是在4、5月雨后进行，为的是保墒，促进生根发芽；第二次是在杂草繁生的7月进行，为的是除草，以免妨碍幼树生长；第三次是在9、10月间进行，为的是保秋墒，给来年生长创造条件。巉口林场也进行三次，5、6月间一次，雨季大雨后一次，秋后一次。这样松土除草，扩大了幼树的营养面积，创造了良好的生长发育条件。巉口林场1957年秋栽植的二年生榆树苗，经过两次除草松土，现在成活率在80％以上，一般高达六十公分。
    二、林地铺沙，保墒抗旱。这是徐家山林场根据兰州郊区农民种沙田的经验而采用的办法。据观察，林地铺沙后，保墒抗旱能力大大增强，即使在春旱时期，沙石下面仍是湿润的。这里的事实证明全面铺沙效果最好。同时经过铺沙，还可以减少松土工序，杂草也少，是干旱地区一种最长远的保墒抗旱办法。
    三、壅埋土丘，防冻保苗。这里地势高，风害冻害严重，新生幼苗常因受风害冻害而生长不良，甚至枯死。1958年冬，徐家山林场采用壅埋土丘的办法，防风防冻，保护三十万株幼苗安全过冬，效果很好。据观察，埋土的墒好，刨去土丘后，表土湿润，未埋土的表土干燥。据徐家山林场的实践，一人一天可以埋一千到一千五百株，可以刨开一千五百到二千株。
    四、修枝要适龄适度。为有利于树木往高生长和提高材质，还应进行必要的人工修枝。但决定树木生长好坏的因素，不是修枝，而是土壤水分和养分，因此，修枝一定要适龄适度。
    五、种植绿肥作物或施肥，以提高土壤肥力。干旱地区林地不仅干燥，而且瘠薄，因此，在做好蓄水保墒的同时，还要提高土壤肥力。巉口林场1959年计划在幼林行间间种豌豆、蚕豆等作物，开花后翻到林地里作绿肥，以提高土壤肥力。
    兰州徐家山、定西巉口林场的经验告诉我们，幼林抚育是创造有利于幼林生长条件的主要措施，也是巩固造林成果的主要环节，没有抚育就没有新林。尽管他们所采取的幼林抚育方法还不够完整，有些作法限于当地的气候、土壤、地形、地势等具体情况不一定适用于其它地区，有些作法还有待于实践来继续考验，但无疑对各地都有一定的参考价值。
