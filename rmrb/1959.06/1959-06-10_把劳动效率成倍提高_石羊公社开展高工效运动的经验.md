    Multiply Labor Efficiency
    —Experiences of Shiyang Commune in Carrying Out High-Efficiency Movement
    By our reporters Liu Zongtang and Xu Weigang
    With rural labor efficiency repeatedly increasing, is there still potential? Can the problem of insufficient labor during the summer harvest and planting be solved?
    The experiences of Shiyang People's Commune in Huayang County, Sichuan Province, in carrying out the high-efficiency movement demonstrate that there is potential, and it is significant, and the difficulty of insufficient labor during the summer harvest and planting can be solved. The commune's high-efficiency movement began in late April. By the end of May, the labor efficiency of the commune members had increased by more than double on average. The improvement in several major agricultural tasks was as follows: (Calculated per medium labor unit per day)
    		April Late	May Late
    Transplanting Rice Seedlings 	3/10 Acre	1 Acre
    Harvesting Wheat 		5/100 Acre	8/100 Acre
    Plowing Fields 		2.5 Acres	4 Acres
    Due to the doubled efficiency, the commune's summer harvest and planting work this year was among the fastest and best in the county.
    Demanding Labor from High Efficiency
    The Shiyang Commune has more than 15,000 members and more than 19,000 mu of land, mainly producing rice, wheat, and rapeseed throughout the year. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, labor has consistently been tight. After the start of this year's summer harvest and planting, the tight situation became even more serious, mainly because the area of mid-season rice was expanded, and the harvesting of spring crops and the transplanting of rice seedlings were squeezed together. In addition, the technical specifications for deep plowing, fertilization, and close planting were raised, increasing the amount of work required. Furthermore, the seasonality of these agricultural tasks is very strong.
    According to several calculations: within 45 days after Grain Rain, it is necessary to complete the harvesting of 10,000 mu of rapeseed and wheat, and the deep plowing, fertilization, and transplanting of more than 17,000 mu of early rice and mid-season rice. This requires more than 710,000 labor days. With more than 7,500 laborers in the commune, each person must do an average of 2.1 labor days per day.
    In order to solve this difficulty, they have repeatedly adopted methods such as squeezing, compressing, exchanging, and extracting to transfer 82% of the labor force to agricultural production. However, after all the calculations, there was still a large shortfall of labor.
    When early rice transplanting began, members of the youth team of the second production team in the Dengta Management Area found that although their team's work efficiency had improved significantly compared to the past, there were still many loopholes. For example, some team members were not focused enough when transplanting seedlings; they held the seedlings too high; the round trip time during transplanting increased; and the people pulling seedlings and transplanting seedlings were not separated, resulting in too many people at one time and too few at another, often causing work stoppages and waiting for materials. They immediately made improvements to address these shortcomings. As a result, the work efficiency of the entire team averaged more than the quota of transplanting 3/10 of an acre per person per day, reaching 0.59 acre.
    The commune Party committee was greatly inspired by this incident: the same people, the same working conditions, as long as they are full of energy and improve operating methods and labor organization, they can greatly improve efficiency. They immediately held an on-site meeting in the youth team, commended the team members' enthusiasm and creativity, introduced their experiences in improving efficiency, and clearly put forward the call to "demand labor from high efficiency." Many cadres and the masses were deeply educated, and those who previously thought there was no potential to be tapped changed their views; those who did not know how to further improve labor efficiency found a way. On the third day after the on-site meeting, the twelfth production team created a new record of transplanting an average of 7/10 of an acre per person per day. In this way, a high-efficiency movement centered on improving technology, with everyone chasing each other, quickly unfolded throughout the commune.
    Establishing Models, Motivating the Backward
    When the movement was launched, how to make it develop comprehensively and deeply, the Shiyang Commune explored an important experience: establishing models to drive the backward.
    The characteristics of the commune's establishment of models are that cadres take the lead in participating, and some cadres themselves are models of high efficiency. The models established are diverse: there are those who harvest wheat, those who transplant seedlings, those who transport, those who use cattle; there are men, women, old, and young; there are individuals and collectives; there are team-level, management area-level, and commune-level, etc. After the models are established, with clear goals and concrete examples to learn from, it is most effective in mobilizing the masses and removing various ideological obstacles. For example, when the movement was just launched, some commune members believed that high efficiency could be achieved in single tasks, but not in multiple tasks; a few people could do it, but not collectively; it could be done in the short term, but not in the long term; men could do it, but not women. These erroneous ideas were quickly resolved with the establishment of models.
    The practice of Shiyang Commune in establishing models is based on conducting political and ideological education for commune members, and selecting them through grassroots professional skill competitions (such as wheat harvesting skill competitions). During the summer harvest and planting, the commune-level skill competitions were held three times, with 180 participants; the management area's inter-team skill competitions were held 55 times, with more than 1,500 participants; and there were even more at the production team level. New records appeared at each skill competition, one wave higher than another, which was very lively. For example, in terms of rice seedling transplanting, after several skill competitions, the initial highest record of being able to transplant 60 seedlings per minute jumped to 128.
    Combined with the selection from bottom to top is the summarization of the new experiences created by the models from top to bottom, and the promotion of their experiences. In this way, the high-efficiency movement gradually moved from partial to comprehensive, from early rice transplanting to all aspects of agricultural production.
    Their method of motivating the backward is to combine top-down and left-right, working together to help the backward teams improve their work. For example, the Yumin Management Area was very slow to start transplanting seedlings, so the commune Party committee secretary took two capable cadres to the area to assist in the work, and organized technical experts from other districts and teams to teach techniques in the area. The area also organized commune members to observe and learn in advanced districts and teams. In this way, the high-efficiency movement flourished in every region.
    Improving Organization, Establishing Systems
    Improving production organization, strengthening coordination between work stages, careful planning and flexible command are also important links to ensure the effective development of the high-efficiency movement. In order to facilitate evaluation and competition, and to break through quotas, each production team adopted the method of assigning techniques to the teams, and organizing production according to each person's expertise. For example, those who know how to transplant seedlings form a transplanting professional group, and those who know how to plow fields form a plowing professional group, so that everyone can fully utilize their expertise.
    In terms of labor allocation and work arrangement, each production team formulates specific arrangements for each ten-day period and each day based on the tasks assigned at each level, emphasizing that tasks are assigned to individuals and notifying them the day before, so that they can prepare early. The teams generally arrange two sets of work - one for sunny days and one for rainy days, to avoid idleness in case of changes in the situation. In terms of command, they always clarify the main direction of attack and successfully apply the "small corps" operation. This "small corps" is generally composed of two or three production teams, which are mobile and flexible, easy to dispatch, and easy to implement the principle of equal exchange.
    With the development of the high-efficiency movement, they paid special attention to the adjustment between work stages. Each team is equipped with a commando force dedicated to remedying weak links. For example, in the transplanting of mid-season rice, because the efficiency of transplanting has improved rapidly and the plowing cattle power is insufficient, each team immediately sent a commando force to dig fields by manpower to ensure the progress of transplanting.
    Reasonable Quotas, Timely Rewards
    Shiyang Commune paid special attention to the following points when setting quotas: First, the quota should not be too high or too low, generally "it can be completed with effort, and it can be exceeded with extra effort." Second, different quotas should be set according to different objects such as women, adults, young people, and teenagers. Third, constantly break through and constantly revise. Revisions are discussed by the masses. Fourth, strictly implement the acceptance system to ensure quality requirements. Each production brigade organizes an acceptance team, and each production team has an acceptance officer. The day's work is accepted on the same day, and work points and awards are evaluated based on the acceptance ticket.
    When awarding prizes, equal emphasis is placed on honor rewards and material rewards. The biggest feature of their reward method is timeliness. The production teams evaluate and reward prizes on the same day. Conscientiously implementing this incentive method has a great effect on promoting the development of the high-efficiency movement. After several consecutive awards, a upsurge of "everyone striving to be upstream, everyone on the red list" was set off, and 580 production models at the commune level, more than 2,400 "top students" at the district and team level, and 18 production teams with "full production" emerged throughout the commune.
                        *　*　*
    Carrying out the high-efficiency movement is not to solve the temporary difficulty of insufficient labor, but a direction for long-term efforts. This is the conclusion drawn by Shiyang Commune after recently summarizing the previous stage of the movement. After the summer harvest and planting, most of the labor force has been transferred to the field management of early rice and mid-season rice, sending public grain and selling surplus grain, and developing diversified economy. They continued to carry out the high-efficiency movement in these agricultural tasks and achieved the same results.
    According to their preliminary summary, the inadequacy of the high-efficiency movement in the previous stage was that it was not closely integrated with tool reform. In the future, they will focus on strengthening this aspect of work and creating higher labor efficiency.

    把劳动效率成倍提高
    ——石羊公社开展高工效运动的经验
    本报记者　刘宗棠　徐维纲
    农村劳动效率一再提高，还有没有潜力？夏收夏种劳力不足的问题能不能解决？
    四川华阳县石羊人民公社开展高工效运动的经验说明：潜力有，而且很大，夏收夏种劳力不足的困难可以解决。这个公社的高工效运动是4月下旬开始的，到5月底止，全社社员劳动效率平均提高一倍多，其中几项主要农活提高的情况是：（以中等劳力每人每天计算）
         4月下旬　 5月下旬
    栽秧　三分　     一亩
    割麦　五分　     八分
    犁田　二亩五分　 四亩
    由于工效成倍的提高，该社今年夏收夏种工作是全县做得又快又好的一个。
    向高工效要劳力
    石羊公社共有社员一万五千多人，田土一万九千多亩，全年以生产水稻、小麦、油菜为主。自从去年大跃进以来，劳力一向紧张。今年夏收夏种开始后，紧张情况更加严重，主要是因为中稻面积扩大，小春作物收割和水稻栽插挤在一起，再加深耕、施肥和密植等技术规格要求提高，需工量增大，而这些农活的季节性非常强烈。
    根据几次算账：从谷雨以后四十五天内要完成一万亩油菜和小麦的收割、一万七千多亩的早稻和中稻深耕、施肥和栽插任务，需要七十一万多个劳动日，全社七千五百多个劳动力，平均每人每天要做两点一个劳动日。
    为了解决这个困难，他们曾一次又一次地采取挤、压、换、抽等办法，把82％的劳力都调到农业生产上来。但是，算来算去，劳力仍然相差大半截。
    早稻开始栽插时，灯塔管理区第二生产队青年小队成员发现，他们小队的工作效率虽比过去提高很多，但还有不少漏洞。如有些队员栽秧时精神不够集中；手里的秧拿得过高；栽插时往返时间增加；扯秧和栽秧的人没有分开，扯秧的人一时多了，一时少了，时常造成停工待料等现象。他们立即针对这些缺点作了改进，结果，全队的工作效率平均都超过了每人每天栽插三分的定额，达到五分九厘。
    公社党委从这件事得到很大启示：同样的人，同样的工作条件，只要鼓足干劲，改进操作方法和劳动组合，就能大大提高工效。他们随即在青年小队召开现场会议，表扬队员的积极性和创造性，介绍他们提高工效的经验，明确提出“向高工效要劳力”的号召。许多干部和群众从中都受到深刻的教育，过去认为没有什么潜力可挖的人改变了看法；不知道怎样进一步提高劳动效率的人找到了门路。第十二生产队在现场会议开过的第三天，又创造了平均每天每人栽秧七分的新纪录。这样，一个你追我赶，以改进技术为中心的高工效运动，很快就在全社展开。
    树立标兵　带动落后
    当运动开展起来后，如何使它全面深入地向前发展，石羊公社摸索出的一项重要经验是，树立标兵，带动落后。
    该社树立标兵的特点是，干部带头参加，有些干部本身就是高工效的标兵。树立的标兵多种多样：有割麦的、有栽秧的，有运输的、有使牛的；有男的、女的、老的、少的；有个人的、有集体的；有队一级的、管理区一级的、公社一级的等。标兵树立后，有了明确的奋斗目标，具体学习的榜样，对发动群众，解除各种思想障碍最为有效。如运动刚展开时，有些社员认为实现高工效，单项活路可以，多项不行；少数人可以，集体不行；短期可以、长期不行；男的可以，女的不行。这些错误思想，随着标兵的建立都很快得到解决。
    石羊公社树立标兵的作法，是在对社员进行政治思想教育的基础上，通过由下而上召开的各级专业比武会（如割麦比武会）选拔的。在夏收夏种中，公社性的比武会举行过三次，参加的有一百八十人；管理区各队之间的比武会举行了五十五次，参加的一千五百多人；生产队一级的更多。每一次比武会上都有新纪录出现，一浪高过一浪，热闹非常。如在栽秧方面，经过几次比武，由最初每分钟能栽六十窝的最高纪录，跃升到一百二十八窝。
    与从下而上选拔相结合的，是由上而下地总结标兵创造的新经验，推广他们的经验。这样，高工效运动也逐渐由局部到全面，由早稻栽插普及到农业生产的各个方面。
    他们带动落后的办法，是上下左右结合，共同动手，帮助落后队改善工作。如裕民管理区栽秧动手很迟缓，公社党委书记便带着两个得力干部到该区协助工作，并组织其它区队技术能手到该区传授技术，该区也组织社员到先进区队观摩。这样，高工效运动便蓬蓬勃勃地在每一个地区开展起来。
    改进组织　建立制度
    改进生产组织，加强工序与工序间的配合，计划周密和指挥灵活，也是保证高工效运动有效开展的重要环节。为了便于评比竞赛，突破定额，各生产队采取了技术归队的办法，按照每人的专长组织生产。如会栽秧的组成栽秧专业组，会犁田的组成犁田专业组，使每个人都充分发挥专长。
    在劳力调配和活路安排上，各生产队都根据层层下达的任务，作出每旬每天有具体安排，强调任务落实到人，并在前一天通知本人，以便早作准备。各队在安排活路上一般都是两套——晴天一套，雨天一套，避免一旦情况变化出现窝工。在指挥上，他们时时明确主攻方向，并成功地运用了“小兵团”作战。这种“小兵团”一般都是由两、三个生产队组成，机动灵活，好调度，又容易贯彻等价交换政策。
    随着高工效运动的发展，他们特别注意工序之间的调整。各队都配备了一支突击力量，专用来补救薄弱环节。如在中稻栽插中，因栽插工效提高很快，犁田牛力不足，各队立即派出突击力量，用人力挖田，保证栽插进度。
    定额合理　及时奖励
    石羊公社在制定定额时特别注意以下几点：一、定额不要过高或过低，一般是“努力可以完成，再加劲可以超额。”二、根据妇女、壮年、青年、少年等不同的对象，制定不同的定额。三、不断的突破，不断的修订。修订时都经过群众讨论。四、严格验收制度，保证质量要求。每个生产大队组织有验收小组，每个生产队有验收员，当天活路当天验收，凭验收票评工记分和评奖。
    评奖时，荣誉奖励与物质奖励并重。他们奖励办法的最大特点是及时。各生产队评奖，都是当天评奖，当天兑现。认真执行这种鼓励办法，对推动高工效运动发展很有作用。在连续几次评奖之后，跟着就掀起了一个“人人争上游，个个上红榜”的热潮，全社涌现了五百八十个社一级的生产模范，二千四百多个区队一级的“状元”，另外还有十八个“生产满堂红”的生产队。
                        ＊　＊　＊
    开展高工效运动，不是为了解决临时性的劳力不足的困难，而是一个长久努力的方向。这是石羊公社最近总结了前一段运动后得出的结论。在夏收夏种结束后，大部劳力已转入早稻中稻田间管理、送公粮卖余粮和发展多种经济。他们在这些农活上继续开展了高工效运动，也收到了同样的效果。
    根据他们初步总结，前一阶段高工效运动开展不足的地方是，与工具改革结合不密切。今后将着重加强这方面的工作，创造出更高的劳动效率。
