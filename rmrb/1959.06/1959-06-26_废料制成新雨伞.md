Waste Materials Made into New Umbrellas

The paper umbrella factory in Qingliushi Commune, Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province, recently produced more than 10,000 paper umbrellas. These new umbrellas were originally made from waste materials. For example, workers in the papermaking workshop used discarded yellow birch bark, crushed by machine, to make leather paper; and purchased the residue of willow and pine roots to replace the willow and pine roots used to make glue.

    废料制成新雨伞
    浙江乐清县清柳市公社纸伞厂最近生产了一万多把纸伞。这些新雨伞原来是用废物制成的。例如造纸车间的职工利用废弃的黄拆木皮用机器打烂，做皮纸；购买柳松根的残末代替制胶水的柳松根。
