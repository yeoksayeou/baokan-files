Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 3rd: Shucheng County in Anhui Province has adopted various measures to mobilize veteran schools to lead newly established schools and to promote cooperation between schools, resulting in rapid progress in the teaching work of the county's newly established schools.

Last year, Shucheng County established six new middle schools, increasing the total number of students in the county from 2,131 to 3,655. These newly established schools had a weak foundation and faced many difficulties in terms of teaching equipment, teacher allocation, and teaching organization. In response to this situation, the Shucheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first strengthened the Party's leadership in these six schools, and then determined that four veteran schools would be responsible for assisting the six new schools. The veteran schools were very concerned about the new schools they were leading. In addition to providing material support, they also selected eight experienced teachers to serve as directors of studies, heads of teaching and research groups, and class teachers in the new schools, specifically helping new teachers improve their professional skills. Leaders from the veteran schools also regularly visited the new schools to help solve specific problems.

Based on the characteristics of school work, in the cooperation between veteran and new schools, the veteran schools focused on the three stages of school commencement, mid-term inspection, and end-of-term work, providing phased guidance to the new schools. At the beginning of the semester, each veteran school helped the new schools solve problems related to teaching equipment, textbooks, and reference books, based on the needs of the new schools. For example, Xiaotian Junior High School lacked textbooks. In addition to lending some textbooks, the veteran school also printed Chinese and arithmetic textbooks for the students of this school, solving the difficulty of starting classes. In the middle of the semester, the veteran schools adopted a method of demonstration at different points to help teachers in the new schools master classroom teaching methods. According to the instructions of the County Committee, the principals of the four veteran schools organized inspection teams for five subjects, including Chinese, arithmetic, biology, chemistry, and production knowledge, to comprehensively understand the situation in each new school and provide timely and specific help, so that teachers in the new schools generally improved from lesson preparation, classroom teaching, after-class tutoring, to handling and correcting homework and unit reviews. The new schools also actively organized teachers to learn classroom teaching experience from the veteran schools. At the end of the term, the veteran schools helped the new schools conduct end-of-term summary work, so that the new schools could receive help from the veteran schools from the beginning to the end of the semester.

In promoting inter-school cooperation, Shucheng County also used vacations to organize teachers from new and veteran schools to collectively prepare lessons, with some teachers from veteran schools as the backbone, in order to improve the level of teachers. Last winter vacation, a lesson preparation group for politics, natural sciences, history, and geography was organized, mainly composed of teachers from Shucheng Middle School. Thirty-five new teachers participated in the lesson preparation. In the lesson preparation, they focused on solving the most needed problems, tried to give full play to the role of veteran school teachers, to lead the new, arranged the teaching progress, carried out class hour division, and wrote lesson preparation notes. Through collective lesson preparation, the teaching level of teachers in new schools has been further improved.

After Shucheng County's schools implemented inter-school cooperation and the method of veteran schools leading new schools, the relationship between new and veteran schools became very harmonious, and the teaching work in the newly established schools progressed rapidly. At present, the teaching progress of all six newly established middle schools in the county is very normal, students' academic performance has significantly improved, and the quality of teaching has been steadily increasing.

    老校带新校并肩前进
    舒城新办六所中学步步提高
    新华社合肥3日电　安徽省舒城县采取各种措施，发动老校带新校，开展学校与学校之间的协作，使全县新办学校的教学工作进步很快。
    舒城县去年新建了六所中学，全县学生人数由原来的二千一百三十一人增加到三千六百五十五人。这些新办的学校基础薄弱，教具设置、师资配备、教学组织等方面都有不少困难。针对这一情况，中共舒城县委首先加强了这六所学校的党的领导；然后确定四所老校分工负责帮助六所新校。各个老学校对所带的新校非常关心，除了在物质上支援新校外，还选拔了八位有经验的教师，分别担任各新校的教务主任、教研组长、班主任等工作，具体帮助新教师提高业务水平。老学校的领导同志也定期到新校，帮助解决具体问题。
    根据学校工作的特点，在新老学校协作中，老学校抓紧开学工作、期中检查、结束工作三个阶段，对新学校分段辅导。在开学之初，各个老校都根据新校的需要，帮助他们解决教具、教材和参考书。如晓天初中没有教材，老学校除借给一部分课本外，还为这个学校学生代印语文、算术教材，解决了上课的困难。在学期中间，各个老学校又采取分点示范的办法，帮助新校教师掌握课堂教学方法。根据县委指示，四所老学校的校长组织了语文、算术、生物、化学、生产知识等五科的检查组，分别深入各个新学校了解全面情况，及时给予具体帮助，使新校教师从备课、课堂教学、堂下辅导到处理、订正作业和单元复习都得到了普遍的提高。新学校也主动组织教师到老校学习课堂教学经验。在期末结束时，各个老学校又帮助各新学校进行期终总结工作，使新学校从学期开始到学期结束都能得到老校的帮助。
    舒城县在开展校际协作中还利用假期以一部分老校教师为骨干，组织新、老学校的教师集体备课，以提高师资水平。去年寒假便组织了以舒城中学教师为主的政治、自然、史地备课组。参加备课的有三十五个新教师。他们在备课中，以解决最需要的问题为主，尽量发挥老校教师的作用，以老带新，安排了教学进度，进行课时划分，并写成备课笔记。通过集体备课，进一步提高了新学校教师的教学水平。
    舒城县各学校实行校际协作、以老校带新校的办法后，新、老学校的关系非常融洽，新办学校的教学工作进步很快。目前，全县新办的六所中学的教学进度很正常，学生的学习成绩有显著提高，教学质量一直稳步上升。
