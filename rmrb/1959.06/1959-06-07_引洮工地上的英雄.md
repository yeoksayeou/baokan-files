Heroes on the Yintai Construction Site
By our reporter Wang Tiqiang

On the Yintai construction site, heroes are everywhere. Some are vanguards who cleverly conquer cliffs and precipices, some are warriors who fight against raging waves, some are selfless and dedicated fighters, and some are pioneers of creation and invention. They are all ordinary people, simple people, but they have a common great ideal and ambition: to build the Yintai water diversion project as soon as possible with the fastest speed and the least manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and fundamentally change the arid face of eastern Gansu.

Wisely Taking Lama Cliff
On November 17, 1958, civilian worker Zhou Zhanlong arrived at Lama Cliff, one of the thousands of cliffs and precipices on the Yintai construction site. When Zhou Zhanlong saw Lama Cliff, he thought of the description of Lama Cliff in poetry:

"Hearing of Lama Cliff, gods and ghosts dare not come,
Looking up, the cliff is dangerous,
Looking down, the waves roll,
To the left, the Gate of Hell, to the right, the Star of Longevity."

Indeed, Lama Cliff is dangerous enough. It is a high mountain standing between Sazha Ridge and Longevity Station, 2,400 meters above sea level. The top of the cliff soars into the sky, and birds and beasts do not reach it. To cut a 40-meter-wide canal in the middle of the cliff, water must be able to pass through. To open a canal, someone must first climb up and open a road to provide a foothold for the civilian workers to construct. Zhou Zhanlong was the one tasked with this mission of opening the road.

Zhou Zhanlong, as fierce as a dragon and as strong as a tiger, without saying a word, tied a hemp rope around his waist and climbed from the left side of the cliff to the upper right side. At first, he climbed up holding onto the small knots of the horizontal rock, and although he could only step on his toes, he could still climb slowly. But when he reached more than two zhang high, it was all vertical rock, smooth and unscalable. He tried several times, but always failed to pass. The first attempt failed.

At noon the next day, Zhou Zhanlong expressed to the Party that he would climb Lama Cliff again. He followed the original route and climbed to where he had reached the first time, and then turned upwards again. As he climbed, he found two dead branches in front of him and wanted to grab them to rest, but when he reached out to grab one, it broke with a "crack." Fortunately, he was held by the other branch that had not broken, and he did not fall from the cliff. He wanted to go down, but he couldn't find a foothold, and he couldn't even turn his body around. This time, under the guidance of his comrades below the cliff, he returned to the bottom of the cliff. Another failure.

But Zhou Zhanlong is a member of the Communist Youth League! A member of the Communist Youth League should be someone who is not afraid of difficulties. A sense of honor motivated him, and the determination to change the drought supported him. He couldn't eat or sleep, and he kept shouting "Lama Cliff, Lama Cliff" day and night. Some people saw him like this and asked him, "What's wrong with you?" He ignored them. He thought that he couldn't succeed by force, maybe he could succeed by wisdom.

On the third day, he told his two close comrades, Li Haomou and Wei Qiwang, about the method he had thought of, and asked them to be his assistants. After breakfast, they set off with small crowbars. They still climbed along the old route. But when they climbed to the place where they had turned around yesterday, Li Haomou and Wei Qiwang could no longer climb. He had to climb up alone. He used a small crowbar to chisel out a small stone nest where he could step on a toe, move a step, and then chisel out another one and move another step. He didn't know how many nests he had chiseled, how many steps he had moved, or how much strength he had used, but he finally climbed step by step to his destination—a rock jutting out from the cliff wall into mid-air. Standing on the rock, Zhou Zhanlong saw white clouds rolling overhead and heard the roaring sound of the Tao River water below his feet, and he was extremely happy. He quickly put down the rope around his waist and pulled his two comrades up. The three of them swung sledgehammers and drilled three blasting holes. With a loud bang, a construction foothold—a platform—appeared on the cliff. Lama Cliff was conquered.

Flying Across the Tao River
In order for the Party committee to command the project in a timely manner and quickly transmit instructions about the project and the progress of the construction, there were many brave and skilled linesmen on the Yintai construction site who spent years traversing mountains and ridges, dense forests, and canyons along the Yintai route.

One day, Chen Xuelei, a Hui linesman, accepted the task of stringing lines in the Jiuxun Gorge. The Jiuxun Gorge has a treacherous terrain, with the peaks soaring into the clouds and the Tao River below. To string lines here, it was necessary to erect poles on the cloud-capped peaks and to string the wires several times across the wide and treacherous Tao River. When stringing the lines over the Tao River, he could only rely on a few sheepskin rafts floating and swaying on the spray-splashed river surface to work. On the day of stringing the lines, it was raining non-stop, and raindrops and splashes of water kept pouring on them. When he was about to reach the middle of the river, a big wave swept him into the river. The raft workers saw that he had been washed away by the flood and that the telephone line in his hand was gone, and they feared that he had sacrificed himself. However, he was still struggling in the river. When his head emerged from the water, he saw the raft chasing him, and he used all his strength to fight against the raging waves, and finally got close to the raft. He got on the raft and continued his work, and the next day he strung the lines to the other side of the river.

When they reached Xiadawo, they had to string the lines across the Tao River again. Here, the river surface was wide, the water was rapid, and there were many hidden reefs, and the difficulty was even greater because the line poles on both sides of the river were low. The first attempt failed, and the line fell into the water. The second time, the line was caught on a hidden reef, and it also failed. He was very anxious because the task was not completed. The third time, his comrades left him on the shore because he was exhausted, but this time it was the same as the second time, and the line was still caught on the hidden reef. What to do? Would he fail forever? No! At this tense moment, he took off his clothes, hugged a sheepskin bag, and jumped into the rapids. He swam near the hidden reef, pulled the line open, and quickly strung the wire up. However, although the task had been completed, he did not have the strength to swim back. He disregarded the danger to his life and let the water carry him downstream. When he had some strength, he swam back to the shore.

    引洮工地上的英雄
    本报记者　王体强
    在引洮工地上，到处都是英雄人物，有的是智取悬崖绝壁的尖兵，有的是和惊涛骇浪搏斗的勇士，有的是舍己为人的战士，有的是创造发明的先锋。他们都是平凡的人，朴实的人，但是他们有一个共同的伟大的理想和抱负：用最快的速度和最少的人力、财力和物力，尽早地把引洮上山工程修筑出来，根本改变甘肃东部的干旱面貌。
    智取拉马崖
    1958年11月17日，民工周占龙来到引洮工地上千百个悬崖绝壁之一的拉马崖。周占龙一看到拉马崖，就想到诗歌中对拉马崖的描写：
    “听着拉马崖，神鬼不敢来，
    向上望，悬崖险，
    向下看，浪花翻，
    左面鬼门关，右面寿星站。”
    的确，拉马崖是够凶险的了。它是矗立在萨札岭和寿星站中间的一座高山，拔海二千四百公尺。崖顶攀天，鸟兽不到。要在崖腰上开出一条四十公尺宽的渠道，才能使水通过。想开渠，要有人先攀上去，开出一条路，让民工有施工的立足点。周占龙就是担负着这个开路使命的人。
    周占龙，如龙似虎，二话没说，腰栓麻绳，从左边山崖往右上侧爬。起初，攀着横纹岩石的小节疤往上爬，虽然只能踩住脚尖，还可以缓缓爬行。可是到了两丈多高的地方时，都是纵纹岩石，光不可贴，他试了几次，始终过不去。第一次失败了。
    第二天中午，周占龙向党表示，要二登拉马崖。他顺着原路，爬到了第一次到达的地方，然后又转向上爬，爬着爬着，他发现前面有两根枯树枝，想抓住休息一下，可是用手去一抓，其中一根“咔喳”一声断了，幸好被另一根没断的拖住了，他才没有从绝壁上掉下来。他想下来，找不到立足点，连身子也转不过来。这一次，他在崖下战友的指点下回到了崖下。又失败了。
    可是，周占龙是共青团员呀！共青团员，就应该是不怕困难的人。荣誉感激动着他，改变干旱的决心支持着他。他吃不下饭，睡不着觉，白天晚上嘴里直喊着“拉马崖、拉马崖”。有的人见他这样，问他“你怎么了？”他没有理睬。他想到拉马崖力夺不行了，或许智取可以成功。
    第三天，他把想到的办法告诉了两个亲密的战友李浩谋和魏其旺，并请他们当助手。吃过早饭，他们带上小撬杆出发了。还是沿着老路子爬。但是，当爬到昨天转身的地方，李浩谋和魏其旺就爬不动了。他只好一个人往上爬。他用小撬杆凿出一个能踩住一个脚尖的小石窝，挪一步脚，再凿出一个又挪一步脚。也不知凿了多少窝，挪了多少步脚，用了多少力气，才一步一步地攀到了目的地——一块从崖壁扑向半空的石头上。站在石头上，周占龙看到头顶上白云翻滚，听到脚底下洮河水浪声震天，高兴极了。他赶快放下腰里绳子把两个战友拉上来，三个人抡动大锤，打了三个炮眼，轰隆一声，绝壁上出现了一个施工立足点——平台。拉马崖被征服了。
    飞渡洮河
    为了使党委及时指挥工程的进行，迅速把关于工程的指示和修筑的情况下传上达，引洮工地上有不少勇敢善战的架线员，他们成年累月地在引洮沿线翻山越岭，穿密林，跨峡谷。
    一天，回族青年架线员陈学礼接受了九旬峡架线任务。九旬峡地形险峻，峰顶高入云霄，下面是洮河。在这里架线，既要把线杆插到峰顶云端上，又要把电线几次飞过宽阔险恶的洮河。当在洮河上架飞线时，他只能靠几只羊皮筏子漂浮动荡在浪花飞溅的河面上进行工作。架线那天，雨不停地下着，雨点和水花不停地往他们身上泼。快到河中间时，一个大浪头把他掀到了河里。皮筏工人见他被洪水冲没了，他手里的电话线也不见了，担心他牺牲了。但是，他还在河水里挣扎着。当他的头一露出了水面，看见皮筏直追他，他用尽气力和惊涛骇浪搏斗，终于靠近了皮筏。他上了皮筏，又继续进行工作，第二天把线架到了河对岸。
    到了下大窝，又要把线架过洮河。这里河面宽，河水急，暗礁多，架线时两岸线杆低，困难就更多了。第一次没成功，线落到水里去了。第二次线被暗礁挂住，也失败了。任务完不成，他心里很着急。第三次，同志们因为他疲累不堪了，把他留在岸上，但这次又和第二次一样，线仍然被挂在暗礁上。怎么办呢？难道将永远失败下去？不！当这紧张的当儿，他把衣服一脱，抱住一个羊皮袋就跳进了激流里，游到暗礁附近把线拉开，把电线迅速架了起来。可是，任务虽已完成，却没有力量游回来了，他顾不上生命危险，让水冲着顺水而下，当他有了点力气时，才游回岸边。（附图片）
