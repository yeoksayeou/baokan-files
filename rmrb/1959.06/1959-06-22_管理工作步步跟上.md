    Management Work Keeps Pace Step by Step
    This year, Jinxiang County in Jiangxi Province achieved unprecedented wheat harvests (the county's average yield was twice as high as last year, with over 15,000 mu yielding 400 jin per mu). A crucial factor was the intensive management of wheat fields from planting to harvesting. In terms of management, a system of assigning measures to each plot and responsibility to each individual was implemented.

    In terms of technical measures, the focus was on topdressing, loosening soil, and draining waterlogging, with emphasis on key stages such as tillering, jointing, and booting. During the wheat growth period, the county organized four major management campaigns. Between "Heavy Snow" and "Winter Solstice," wheat generally emerged, but a winter drought and lack of fertilizer affected the reviving and stooling of wheat seedlings. At this time, a "Apply Winter Fertilizer" campaign was launched throughout the county, applying 10 to 15 dan of liquid manure per mu. Between "Major Cold" and "Start of Spring," winter rains fell, and the water problem was basically solved. Seizing this favorable opportunity, a second topdressing was launched. During topdressing, wheat seedlings were classified and ranked, with third-class seedlings fertilized first, followed by second-class seedlings, and then first-class seedlings. Around "Awakening of Insects," continuous spring rains caused the wheat fields to become hardened, affecting the normal growth (jointing) of wheat seedlings. At this time, a third wheat field assault was launched: a rush to topdress, a rush to loosen soil, and a rush to dredge drainage ditches. Around "Vernal Equinox," during the booting stage of wheat, occasional strong winds and rain appeared, causing some high-yielding fields to lodge due to excessive planting density and excessive fertilization; in remote areas, a small number of third-class wheat plants were thin and yellow. Based on the opinions of the masses during discussions, the county committee launched a fourth management campaign—to eliminate third-class seedlings and prevent lodging.

    Through these four major management campaigns, a total of 1.05 million dan of fertilizer was applied to the county's 220,000 mu of wheat, and the soil was loosened one to two times, ensuring the normal growth of wheat seedlings.　Xing Haichuan

    管理工作步步跟上
    今年江西进贤县小麦获得空前丰收（全县平均单产比去年高两倍，有一万五千多亩，亩产量达到四百斤），其中很重要的一条经验，是从种到收抓紧了麦田管理。在管理上推行了措施到丘，责任到人的档案制度。
    在技术措施方面，着重以追肥、松土、排渍为中心，抓住分蘖、拔节和孕穗等主要环节。在小麦生长期间，全县先后组织了四大管理高潮。在“大雪”到“冬至”间，小麦普遍出苗，当时遇到冬旱缺肥，影响了麦苗返青发蔸。这时便在全县开展了“施腊肥”运动，每亩施水粪十到十五担。在“大寒”到“立春”间：下了冬雨，水的问题基本解决，抓住这一有利时机，展开了第二次追肥。追肥过程中把麦苗分类排队，先追三类苗，后追二类苗，再追一类苗。在“惊蛰”前后春雨连绵，麦田板结，影响麦苗正常生长（拔节），这时又开展了麦田三突击：突击追肥、突击松土、突击开沟排水。在“春分”前后正当麦苗孕穗阶段，时有狂风暴雨出现，部分高额丰产田小麦因播种过密，施肥过多，成片倒伏了；边远地区少数三类麦长得又瘦又黄。县委根据群众座谈的意见，展开了第四次管理高潮——消灭三类苗和防止倒伏。
    通过这四大管理高潮，全县二十二万亩小麦，共施肥一百零五万担，松土一至两次，保证了麦苗的正常生长。　邢海川
