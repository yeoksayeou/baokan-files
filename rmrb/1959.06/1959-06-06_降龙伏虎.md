    "Taming the Dragon, Subduing the Tiger"
    The China Youth Art Theatre is currently rushing to stage a large-scale drama, "Taming the Dragon, Subduing the Tiger."
    On the stage of the rehearsal hall, a "Recruitment Notice" with gold characters on a red background hangs on a large pine tree. Amidst a burst of gongs and drums, someone sings a rhythmic clapper verse: "Who are the heroes and brave men? Take down the red notice and compete! Build bridge piers in the Dragon Extension River, so that the Hundred Treasures can come down the mountain..." Old men and young men argue noisily, but no one dares to take down the red notice. Suddenly, Jin Delong, the battalion commander of the Longmen Commune, played by the actor An Ran, arrives with commune members; his father was a famous "Undersea Dragon" in his day. Just as he is arguing with members of the Tielongshan Commune to take down the notice, Zhao Dakang (played by Wang Jianxin), the tiger-fighting hero, appears. Neither is willing to be outdone, and as a result, two bridge pier shock brigades named "Taming the Dragon" and "Subduing the Tiger" are formed.
    "Taming the Dragon, Subduing the Tiger" is set against the background of the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production, and depicts the story of people overcoming natural difficulties. The director is Wu Xue. (Attached picture)

    “降龙伏虎”
    中国青年艺术剧院正赶排大型话剧“降龙伏虎”。
    排演场的舞台上，红底金字的“招贤榜”挂在大松树上。一片锣鼓声中，有人唱起快板：“谁是英雄好汉，揭下红榜比比看，龙延河里架桥墩，好让百宝齐下山……”老人和小伙子们吵吵嚷嚷，但谁也不敢揭红榜。突然，由演员安冉饰演的龙门公社营长金德隆带着社员过来了，他的父亲当年是有名的“海底蛟龙”。当他为了揭榜正同铁龙山公社社员争吵时，打虎英雄赵大康（王简信饰）出现了，两人谁也不肯示弱，结果组成了以“降龙”、“伏虎”命名的两个架桥墩突击队。
    “降龙伏虎”以大炼钢铁为背景，描写了人们战胜自然困难的故事。导演是吴雪。（附图片）
