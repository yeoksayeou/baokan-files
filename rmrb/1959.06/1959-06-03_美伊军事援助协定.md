US-Iraq Military Assistance Agreement

The US-Iraq Military Assistance Agreement was secretly signed on April 21, 1954, and announced on the 25th of the same month. Prior to this, in March 1953, the reactionary Iraqi government had already requested US military assistance, and after more than a year of negotiations, an agreement was finally reached. According to this agreement, the United States would supply the Iraqi army with enough tanks, heavy artillery, cannons, and aircraft to equip four divisions. Over a three-year period, the United States would provide Iraq with $100 million in aid. Under this agreement, the United States sent a military survey team to Iraq in mid-May of the same year, and a military advisory group to Iraq on September 15 to inspect and prepare the equipment to be supplied to Iraq under the US-Iraq Military Assistance Agreement, and to train Iraqi personnel in the use of this equipment. The agreement also included a secret clause stipulating that Iraq would join the Turkish-Pakistani agreement, which later became the starting point for the Baghdad Pact.

The signing of the US-Iraq Military Assistance Agreement was not only a step by the United States to pull Iraq into the Baghdad Pact, but also a step to squeeze out British influence in the Middle East. Therefore, the signing of the agreement was met with fierce resistance from Britain. Later, the United States agreed to purchase some of the weapons "aid" to Iraq from Britain, and the United States and Britain reached a compromise.

After the signing of the US-Iraq Military Assistance Agreement, it was consistently opposed by the broad masses of the Iraqi people. In the same month that the agreement was announced, Iraqi peace advocates issued an appeal against dragging Iraq into the Turkish-Pakistani agreement and accepting US "aid." In May, Iraqi peace advocates announced their election platform in the parliamentary elections, once again opposing the Iraqi government's pursuit of the war policies of the United States and Britain. In July, Iraqi peace advocates held a national peace conference to oppose the establishment of aggressive blocs in the Near and Middle East. Now that the Iraqi Republic government has announced its withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact and renounced the Eisenhower Doctrine, it has also abolished the military agreement signed with the United States.

    美伊军事援助协定
    美伊军事援助协定是在1954年4月21日秘密签订的，并在25日公布了这件事。在这之前即1953年3月，伊拉克反动政府已经要求美国军事援助，经过一年多的谈判终于达成协议。根据这一协定，美国将供给伊拉克军队以足够装备四个师的坦克、重炮、大炮、飞机等。在为期三年的时间中，美国援助伊拉克一亿美元，根据这一协定，美国在同年5月中派遣了一个军事调查团到伊拉克；在9月15日又派了一个军事顾问团到伊拉克。以便检查和准备根据美伊军事援助协定供给伊拉克的装备，并将训练伊拉克人员使用这些装备。在这一协定中还附有一项秘密条款，规定伊拉克加入后来成为巴格达条约起点的土耳其和巴基斯坦协定。
    美伊军事援助协定的签订不仅是美国为了把伊拉克拉进巴格达条约，而且是为了排挤英国在中东的势力的一个步骤，因此协定的签订曾经受到英国的激烈抗拒。后来美国答应了“援助”伊拉克的一部分武器将向英国购买，美英才取得了妥协。
    美伊军事援助协定签订后，一直遭到伊拉克广大人民的反对，在协定公布的同年同一个月，伊拉克和平拥护者就发出呼吁，反对把伊拉克拖入土巴协定和接受美国“援助”。5月，伊拉克和平拥护者在参加议会竞选中公布竞选纲领，再次反对伊拉克政府追随美英的战争政策；7月，伊拉克和平拥护者又举行全国和平大会，反对在中近东建立侵略集团。现在伊拉克共和国政府在宣布退出巴格达集团、摈弃艾森豪威尔主义之后，又废除了同美国签订的军事协定。
