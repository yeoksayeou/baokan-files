    Spring in Germany
    Zhao Ruihong
    When the train first arrived in Berlin, it sped past birch forests, followed by red-tiled buildings on both sides; the potted flowers in the morning light bloomed so brightly, and the black, red, and yellow national flag fluttered in the windows. Approaching Berlin, I was so excited that the pleasant twelve-day long march was about to be completed. In books, newspapers, music, and poetry, I had already become intimate with you, ah, Berlin! Now I am about to throw myself into your embrace—the magnificent capital of the German people! You have been resurrected from the flames of liberation, a phoenix reborn! You are full of new life! At the East Station, I met German friends for the first time, representatives of a new country and a new generation; we seemed like old acquaintances, shaking hands warmly, and I was surrounded by smiling faces like flowers. Bright sunshine shone on East Berlin, and red banners with white characters decorated the tall buildings; crowds moved to the music on the long streets—Berlin is singing! Berlin is fighting! Fighting for the democratic unification of Germany! Fighting for the peaceful construction of socialism! Phoenix reborn! The hometown of Marx, people walk in this red world. Cars sped past Stalin Avenue, past the long bridge where seagulls were flying… Ah, Berlin! You attract me with your magnificent new appearance, and my heartstrings are already vibrating gently. How happy and excited my heart is! Poetic verses can't help but gush from the bottom of my heart! At this moment, prose must lose its luster, only the wings of lyrical poetry can fly into the sky! Raise a glass to President Pieck's health! Celebrate the everlasting friendship between China and Germany! Here, in Thälmann Square, dedicate the first song to the German people!

    Song of the Baltic Sea
    Vast and blue Baltic Sea!
    The rose-colored splendor emerging from the morning sun!
    The earth revolves towards the sun,
    My heart opens to the sea!
    I stand on the island of Goethe and Beethoven,
    Pushkin's homeland is to my east;
    To the west is the land of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales,
    Across from me is the hometown of Strindberg.
    Waves splash on the shores of these countries,
    Friendship connects the hearts of all peoples,
    Sunshine, poetry, and the sound of waves, a peaceful harmony!
    The light of October shines in all directions!
    Today the sea is calm and tranquil,
    Fishing boats near and far sail in the morning light—
    Those on the boats and on the shore are all my brothers,
    All who love peaceful life are my relatives!
    German cargo ships are sailing to Tianjin,
    Soviet warships have visited London,
    May the sea forever carry friendship and colorful flags,
    Carry seagulls, carry the music of salutes!
    Whoever dares to stir up a storm in the Baltic Sea again,
    Whether it is West German fascists or American robbers,
    I will use the steel tip of my pen dipped in the ink of accusation,
    To nail them forever on my manuscript!
    Vast and blue Baltic Sea!
    The rose-colored splendor emerging from the morning sun!
    The earth revolves towards the sun,
    My heart opens to the sea!

    德国的春天
    赵瑞蕻
    初到柏林列车在白桦林中飞奔过去，随后两旁出现红瓦的楼房；晨光中的盆花开得那么?烂，黑、红、黄三色的国旗飘在窗口上。快到柏林了，我是多么的激动，十二天愉快的长征将要完成。我在书本、报纸上，音乐和诗中，早已和你相亲，啊，柏林！如今我将要投入你的怀抱——德国人民的雄伟的京城！你从解放的烈焰中复活过来，凤凰?槃呀！你浑身是新的生命！在东车站我初次遇见德国朋友，一个新国家和新的一代的代表；我们似曾相识，热烈地握手，我周围闪着花朵的微笑。亮堂堂的阳光照耀着东柏林，红布白字的标语装饰着高楼；长街上人群在乐声中活动——柏林在歌唱！柏林在战斗！为德国民主的统一而战斗！为社会主义和平建设而战斗！凤凰?槃呀！马克思的家乡，人们在这个红色的世界里行走。汽车驰过斯大林大街，驰过群鸥飞翔着的长桥……啊，柏林！你以壮丽的新姿，吸引着我，我的琴弦已在轻跳。我的心多么快乐，多么激动！诗句不禁从心窝中喷涌！这时候，散文一定要失去光泽，只有抒情诗的翅膀才能飞上天空！举杯祝贺皮克总统健康！祝贺中德友谊万年长青！在这里，在台尔曼广场上，把第一支歌献给德国人民！
    波罗的海之歌浩瀚碧蓝的波罗的海呀！从朝阳中涌出的玫瑰的光彩呀！地球冲着太阳旋转过去，我的心冲着大海敞开！我站在歌德，贝多芬的岛屿上，普希金的家园就在我的东方；西边是安徒生童话的国土，我的对面是史特林堡的家乡。浪花溅落在这些国家的堤岸上，友谊连结着各族人民的心肠，阳光，诗和涛声，和平的合奏呀！十月的光芒照耀着上下四方！今天海上是风平浪静，远近的渔船迎着晨曦在航行——船上岸上的都是我的兄弟，热爱和平生活的都是我的亲人！德国的货轮在开向天津，苏联的军舰已访问了伦敦，大海要永远载着友谊和彩旗，载着群鸥，载着礼炮的乐音！谁敢再掀起波罗的海风暴，无论是西德法西斯或美国的强盗，我就用笔的钢尖蘸着控诉的墨水，把他们在我的诗稿上永远钉牢！浩瀚碧蓝的波罗的海呀！从朝阳中涌出的玫瑰的光彩呀！地球冲着太阳旋转过去，我的心冲着大海敞开！
