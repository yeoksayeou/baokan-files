Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 26th: According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, Bulgaria announced on the 24th a decision passed by a joint session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers. The decision stipulates that by 1965, the national irrigated area should be increased to at least 20 million decares (one decare equals 1.5 mu), which means an increase of 14 million decares of irrigated area in the next seven years. By 1965, 40% of Bulgaria's total arable land will be transformed into irrigated land, and in the near future, the irrigated area will increase to over 25 million to 30 million decares.

The resolution pointed out that now, due to the completion of the socialist transformation of the countryside, Bulgaria's agriculture has reached a new and higher stage of development, capable of rapidly limiting the harmful effects of frequent droughts and increasing agricultural production by increasing irrigated land in a very short period.

The resolution pointed out that during the sixty-six years of bourgeois rule, the country only had a total of 357,000 decares of irrigated land, while in the fifteen years of the people's regime, the irrigated area increased to 6 million decares.

The resolution stated that since the plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party in October, November of last year, and January of this year, the Bulgarian people have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and launched a large-scale struggle to increase irrigated land in order to achieve a great leap forward in national economic development. In the seven months from November 1958 to early June 1959 alone, newly built water conservancy projects can irrigate 1,531,100 decares of land, which is 3.3 times more than the total irrigated area of Bulgaria before September 9, 1944. Currently, the characteristic of water conservancy construction and soil improvement work is that agricultural production cooperatives are concentrating almost all manpower and material resources on carrying out this work. The residents of the Bulgarian countryside are working selflessly and heroically, which once again proves the high socialist consciousness of the Bulgarian working people in completing the tasks of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The resolution pointed out that in future water conservancy construction, in the initial stage, the main effort should be focused on building those projects that require the least manpower and material resources and can produce economic results immediately in 1960 and 1961.

The resolution stated that the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers believe that the most important aspect of water conservancy and soil improvement projects should be undertaken by cooperatives or jointly by cooperatives and the state.

The resolution stated that in order to increase irrigated area by at least 2 million decares in 1960, it is stipulated that a nationwide water conservancy construction campaign should be launched extensively in the autumn and winter of 1959 and the spring of 1960, in which the labor of agricultural production cooperative members and the voluntary labor of employees and other strata of residents should be utilized to the fullest extent.

The resolution stated that great attention should be paid to using the water of the Danube River for irrigation. Before 1965, an irrigation project should be built on the Danube River that can irrigate 3.27 million decares of fertile land on the Danube Plain. The large-scale construction of this irrigation project will begin in 1959.

### 保共中央和部长会议通过决定  七年内灌溉面积扩大两倍多

    保共中央和部长会议通过决定
    七年内灌溉面积扩大两倍多
    新华社索非亚26日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚24日公布了保加利亚共产党中央委员会和部长会议联席会议通过的一项决定，这项决定规定到1965年，把全国灌溉面积至少增加到二千万狄卡尔（一狄卡尔等于一点五亩），即在今后七年内增加灌溉面积一千四百万狄卡尔。到1965年，保加利亚的耕地总面积的40％将变为水浇地，而在不远的将来，灌溉面积将增加到二千五百万至三千万狄卡尔以上。
    决议指出，现在，由于完成了农村的社会主义改造，保加利亚的农业获得了新的、更高阶段的发展，能够通过在很短的时期内，增加水浇地的办法，迅速地限制经常性旱灾的有害影响，增加农业生产。
    决议指出，在资产阶级统治的六十六年间，全国总共只有三十五万七千狄卡尔水浇地，而在人民政权的十五年期间，灌溉面积就增加到了六百万狄卡尔。
    决议说，自从去年保加利亚共产党中央委员会10月、11月和今年1月的全会之后，保加利亚人民热烈地响应了党的号召，为实现国家经济发展的大跃进，展开了大规模的增加灌溉土地的斗争，仅仅在1958年11月至1959年6月初的七个月中，新建的水利工程就可灌溉一百五十三万一千狄卡尔的土地，比1944年9月9日以前保加利亚的灌溉总面积多三点三倍。目前水利建设和土壤改良工作的特点是，农业生产合作社差不多集中全部人力和物力在进行这项工作，保加利亚农村的居民忘我地、英勇地劳动着，这再次证明保加利亚劳动人民对提前完成五年计划的任务具有高度的社会主义觉悟。
    决议指出，在今后兴修水利当中，在初期，应当把主要力量放在兴建人力物力耗费最少，并且在1960和1961年马上就能产生经济效果的那些工程项目上。
    决议说，保共中央和部长会议认为，兴修水利、土壤改良的工程最主要的应当是由合作社兴办和由合作社和国家合办。
    决议说，为了在1960年最少增加二百万狄卡尔灌溉面积，规定要在1959年秋、冬和1960年春天广泛地开展一个全民兴修水利的运动，在运动中要最充分地利用农业生产合作社社员的劳动以及职工和其他阶层居民的义务劳动。
    决议说，对利用多瑙河水进行灌溉要给予极大的注意。在1965年以前，在多瑙河上要建成可以灌溉三百二十七万狄卡尔的多瑙河平原肥沃土地的灌溉工程，这一灌溉工程将于1959年开始大规模兴建。
