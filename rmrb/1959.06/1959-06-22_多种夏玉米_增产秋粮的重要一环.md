    Planting More Summer Corn
    ——An Important Link in Increasing Autumn Grain Production
    Corn has high yields and a wide range of uses, and has developed rapidly in recent years. In 1958, the national planting area reached 240 million mu, an expansion of 46% compared to 1950. The proportion of corn yield in the total grain yield increased from 9.5% in 1950 to 12.2%. About one-third of the national corn planting area is summer corn. After the winter wheat harvest, planting as much summer corn as possible in the wheat fields is of great significance for a bumper grain harvest throughout the year.
    Facts have proven that areas with more summer corn generally have higher yields of late autumn crops. For example, in the two-crop-a-year areas of Henan, the counties with the highest autumn grain yield per unit area also have the largest summer corn acreage. In 1957, Bo'ai County planted 190,000 mu of autumn grain with an average yield of 232 jin per mu, of which summer corn accounted for 140,000 mu. There are many similar examples in other regions.
    Planting summer corn also has another benefit: the corn harvest period is relatively early, leaving a good stubble, which is very suitable for replanting wheat in the autumn. In the northern one-year-two-crop areas, wheat and summer corn are often grown in rotation, and that's the reason why.
    Corn is a crop that requires relatively high cultivation conditions. During its growth and development, it needs to absorb more fertilizer and water. In order to plant more summer corn and plant it well, and truly achieve increased production per mu, it is necessary to create favorable conditions for the growth and development of summer corn. During the current planting season, the most important thing is to do three things well:
    The first thing is to apply sufficient fertilizer. Corn can only fully realize its yield-increasing potential under conditions of sufficient fertilizer. Most of the fertilizer accumulated in many regions during the winter and spring seasons has already been applied to wheat fields and spring fields. Now, the fertilizer available for summer corn fields is not much. What should we do? In addition to continuing to accumulate fertilizer, in order to save fertilizer and give full play to its effectiveness, we can adopt the fertilizer application method of "digging nests and grabbing a handful of manure," that is, digging nests, spreading manure, and then sowing seeds. If there is not enough well-rotted fertilizer, the fertilizer can be used first in the relatively lean wheat stubble fields. Those originally more fertile fields can be left without basal fertilizer, and top dressing can be applied after emergence.
    The second thing is to seize the time to prepare the land and strive for early sowing. The earlier summer corn is planted, the longer the growing season, and the higher the yield, so it must be planted early. Corn does not grow well on hard stubble land, so the land for planting summer corn should be plowed as much as possible. If, due to the large summer planting area, it is not possible to plow all the land within a few days, and it is not possible to delay timely sowing, what should we do? We can adopt the method of plowing along the rows or digging deep holes according to the location of the seeds; although this will not loosen the entire piece of land, the corn can still be planted in the loose rows or holes. However, after emergence, it is necessary to cultivate deeply between the rows to promote root extension.
    The third thing is to use improved varieties and carefully select seeds. Last year, the first-generation hybrid corn seeds cultivated in various regions increased by one to several times; other improved varieties were propagated even more. These hybrid seeds and improved varieties have a significant yield-increasing effect, generally increasing yield by 15% to 30%, or even doubling, compared to local farmers' varieties. When sowing this summer, all of these seeds must be planted. In some areas, due to insufficient seeds, a portion of the commodity grain in the grain depots was transferred for use as seeds. These commodity grains are relatively mixed, and some are even mixed with late-maturing spring corn seeds, so they must be carefully selected before sowing. Carefully selecting seeds not only ensures strong seedling emergence and increases yield, but also saves a portion of grain, which is a double benefit.

    多种夏玉米
    ——增产秋粮的重要一环
    玉米的产量高，用途广，近几年发展很快。1958年全国种植面积达到二亿四千万亩，比1950年扩大46％；玉米产量在粮食总产量中的比重，由1950年的9.5％提高到12.2％。全国玉米种植面积中，约有三分之一是夏玉米。冬小麦收获以后，在麦地里尽可能多种夏玉米，对全年的粮食丰收有重大的意义。
    事实证明，凡夏玉米种得多的地区，晚秋作物产量一般都比较高。例如河南一年两熟地区，秋粮单位面积产量最高的几个县中，夏玉米的面积也都最大。博爱县1957年种了十九万亩秋粮，平均亩产二百三十二斤，其中夏玉米就占十四万亩。在其他地区，这种例子还很多。
    种夏玉米还有一个好处：玉米收获期比较早，茬口好，对秋季复种小麦十分适宜。北方一年两熟地区，多实行小麦和夏玉米连作，道理就在这里。
    玉米是一种对栽培条件要求较高的作物，在生长发育期间，需要摄取较多的肥料和水分。为了多种夏玉米并且种好，确实做到亩亩增产，必须为夏玉米的生长发育创造良好的条件。在当前播种时期，最重要的是做好三件事：
    第一件事是施足肥料。玉米在肥料充足的条件下才能充分发挥增产潜力。今年许多地区冬春两季所积的肥料，大部分已经施到麦地和春地里，现在可以用到夏玉米地里的肥料是不很多的。怎么办？除了继续积肥以外，为了节约用肥、充分发挥肥效，可以采取“刨窝抓把粪”的施肥方法，即刨窝撒粪以后再点籽。如果腐熟的肥料不够用，可以把肥料先用到比较瘦些的麦茬地里，那些原来比较肥的地可以不施底肥，出苗以后，再补施追肥。
    第二件事是抓紧时间把地整好，争取尽早播种。夏玉米种得越早，生长期越长，产量就越高，因此一定要早种。玉米种在硬茬地上是长不好的，要把种夏玉米的地尽可能耕翻一遍。如果由于夏播面积大，几天内不能全部耕翻，又不可延悞适时播种，怎么办？可以采取顺行串犁或按穴深挖的办法；这样虽然不能把整块土地都耕松，但是玉米仍然可以种在土壤疏松的行子或窝子里。不过，这样做，出苗后一定要在行间深中耕，以促进根系伸展。
    第三件事是要采用优良品种，并精选种子。去年各地培育的玉米杂交第一代种子，增加了一倍到几倍；其他优良品种繁育得更多。这些杂交种和优良品种增产效果显著，一般都比当地农家种增产15％到30％，甚至一倍。今年夏播的时候，要把这些种子全部种上。有些地区由于种子不够用，调用了一部分粮库中的商品粮作种子。这些商品粮比较混杂，有的还夹杂有晚熟的春玉米种子，在播种前一定要精选。精选种子，除能保证出苗茁壮、提高产量外，还能节约一部分粮食，是一举两得的好事。
