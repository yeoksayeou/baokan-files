    Methods, Drive, and Results
    Reading the comparative report on the Yifeng Enamel Factory and the Zhonghua Enamel Factory leaves a vivid impression and profound enlightenment.

    This strong contrast makes us deeply realize that objective conditions are important factors, but even more important is the issue of people's subjective efforts. Under the same conditions, due to people's different attitudes toward things, different levels of drive, and different working methods, the results produced will be completely different.

    The facts of these two factories are like two different mirrors for our vast number of cadres. Everyone can use them to examine themselves and gain inspiration from them. This year is a year of continued Great Leap Forward, and the overall situation is good. However, to achieve a high-speed leap forward in our country, which is so vast and originally had a weak economic foundation, we cannot avoid encountering some difficulties in the road ahead. The quantity, quality, variety, and timing of the supply of certain raw materials cannot keep up with the needs of the production leap forward for the time being. This is a relatively major difficulty at present. Faced with these difficulties, there are two attitudes among the cadres of factories and enterprises. One is like the comrades of the Yifeng Enamel Factory, who, under the leadership of the Party, mustered their energy and fought persistently against the difficulties, achieving great results. The other is like the leading cadres of the Zhonghua Enamel Factory, who lack confidence in overcoming difficulties and therefore lack effective measures, so that problems that could obviously be solved are not solved, and things that could obviously be done are not done successfully, causing undue losses to production. The former attitude is the correct one and should be greatly promoted. The latter attitude is the wrong one and is an obstacle to the continued leap forward in current production. We should help them correct it. Difficulties do have different situations. Some can be completely overcome with effort; some can only be partially overcome even with effort, or even cannot be overcome temporarily. We should have a scientific analytical attitude towards difficulties. As a revolutionary, it is even more important to have a tenacious fighting spirit. Although objective difficulties play a restrictive and hindering role in the development of things, the development of things is to overcome contradictions continuously, that is, to move forward by continuously overcoming difficulties. Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction": "In certain periods of revolutionary struggle, difficult conditions outweigh favorable conditions, and at this time, difficulties are the main aspect of the contradiction, and favorable conditions are the secondary aspect. However, due to the efforts of the revolutionaries, they can gradually overcome the difficulties and develop a new situation of smooth progress, and the difficult situation gives way to the smooth situation." It can be seen that to make the difficult situation give way to the smooth situation and realize this transformation of contradiction, the key lies in the efforts of the revolutionaries. So the problem is not whether there are difficulties and the size of the difficulties, but in the attitude towards difficulties. Is the greater the difficulty, the greater the drive? Or is the greater the difficulty, the smaller the drive? A person with a high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause will of course hold the former attitude and abandon the latter.

    Of course, to overcome difficulties, in addition to a positive attitude, full of energy, and establishing a heroic spirit of despising difficulties strategically, we must also have correct methods. This requires us to seriously go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and work with the masses to overcome difficulties in every possible way. The correct attitude and the correct method complement each other. Without the correct attitude, there cannot be a correct method. But if the attitude is positive and the drive is great, but the method is not correct, the expected results cannot be achieved. Only when there is a correct method at the same time, and we can rely on the masses, can our drive be built on a solid and reliable foundation, and make the subjective desire to overcome difficulties and do a good job in production quickly become a reality. Therefore, when encountering difficulties, the leading cadres of enterprises should stand among the masses like the comrades of the Yifeng Enamel Factory, conscientiously follow the mass line, and ask the masses for advice. Only by truly being with the masses, looking and looking again, thinking and thinking again, analyzing and analyzing again, and then doing it yourself, can you better understand the crux of the difficulties, find ways to overcome the difficulties, and fully mobilize and organize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses to fight against the difficulties in every possible way. With both revolutionary drive and the mass line method, most of the difficulties in front of us can certainly be solved.

### 方法、干劲和结果

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    方法、干劲和结果
    读了益丰搪瓷厂和中华搪瓷厂的对比报道，给人以鲜明的印象和深刻的启发。
    这个强烈的对比使我们深深地认识到：客观条件是重要因素，但更重要的还有一个人们主观努力的问题。在相同的条件下，由于人们对待事物的态度不同，干劲大小不同，工作方法不同，产生的效果也会完全不同。
    这两个工厂的事实，对于我们广大干部来说，是两面不同的镜子，大家都可以拿它来照照自己，从中得到启发。今年是继续大跃进的一年，整个形势是好的。但是，要在我们这样一个幅员辽阔、原来经济基础薄弱的大国，实现高速度的跃进，在前进的道路上，不能不碰到一些困难；某些原料材料供应的数量、质量、品种以及时间上，一时还不能跟上生产跃进的需要，这是目前比较主要的困难。在这些困难面前，工厂企业的干部中，却存在两种态度。一种，就像益丰搪瓷厂的同志那样，在党的领导下，鼓足干劲，与困难作了坚持不懈的斗争，取得了很大的成绩；另一种，就像中华搪瓷厂的领导干部那样，对克服困难缺乏信心，因此缺乏有力的措施，使明明可以解决的问题，得不到解决，明明可以办到的事情，也办不成功，给生产造成不应有的损失。前一种态度，是正确的态度，应该大大加以发扬。后一种态度，是错误的态度，是当前生产继续跃进中的障碍，应当帮助他们改正。所谓困难，确有不同的情况，有的经过努力，完全可以克服；有的虽然经过努力，只能克服一部分，甚至暂时还不能克服，对待困难应该有科学分析的态度。作为一个革命者来说，更重要的是要有顽强的斗志。客观困难对于事物的发展虽然起着限制和阻碍的作用，但是，事物的发展就是在不断克服矛盾，也就是在不断克服困难中前进的。毛主席在“矛盾论”中说：“革命斗争中的某些时候，困难条件超过顺利条件，在这种时候，困难是矛盾的主要方面，顺利是其次要方面。然而由于革命党人的努力，能够逐步地克服困难，开展顺利的新局面，困难的局面让位于顺利的局面。”由此可见，要困难局面让位于顺利的局面，实现这种矛盾的转化，关键在于革命党人的努力。所以问题不在于有无困难和困难的大小，而在于对待困难的态度。是困难愈大干劲愈足呢？还是困难愈大干劲愈小呢？对革命事业具有高度责任感的人，当然持前一种态度而抛弃后一种态度。
    当然，要战胜困难，除了态度积极，干劲鼓足，在战略上树立藐视困难的英雄气概以外，还必须有正确的方法，这就必须认真深入实际，深入群众，和群众一起，千方百计，克服困难。正确的态度和正确的方法是相辅相成的。没有正确的态度，自然不可能有正确的方法，但如果态度积极，干劲很大，而方法不对头，也不能达到预期的效果。只有同时有了正确的方法，能够依靠群众，我们的干劲才能建立在坚实可靠的基础上，使克服困难搞好生产的主观愿望，迅速变为现实。因此，在碰到困难的时候，企业的领导干部应该像益丰搪瓷厂的同志一样，站在群众之中，认真走群众路线，向群众请教。只有真正和群众在一起，看了又看，想了又想，分析了又分析，再亲自动手干一干，才能更好地弄清困难的症结所在，找出克服困难的办法，并且能够把广大群众的积极性创造性充分调动起来，组织起来，千方百计，和困难作斗争。既有革命的干劲，又有群众路线的方法，摆在面前的大部分困难就一定可以得到解决的。
