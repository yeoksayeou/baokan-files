Xinhua News Agency, 5th June, Managua dispatch: The anti-dictatorial armed struggle in Nicaragua is still ongoing, despite the fact that the dictator Somoza previously announced that he would quell the anti-government armed forces within two days. According to a radio broadcast by the Nicaraguan anti-government side, the anti-dictatorial armed forces of political exiles who entered Nicaragua on May 31st and June 1st recently occupied the village of Vivili in northern Nicaragua. At the same time, many residents of the mountainous areas joined their ranks.

According to earlier reports, anti-government forces also occupied strongholds near Santo Tomás, Muimui, and Matagalpa, east and north of the capital.

Somoza admitted on the evening of the 2nd that "the fighting is not going well because the anti-government forces are difficult to pin down." At the same time, although he has consistently called the domestic anti-dictatorial armed struggle "foreign aggression," he had to admit that the vast majority of the armed forces are Nicaraguans.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 4th June dispatch: Havana newspapers today published a statement by the leader of the Nicaraguan anti-dictatorial movement calling on the Nicaraguan people to take up arms against Somoza's tyranny.

The statement said that the anti-dictatorial struggle must be carried through to the end, and the fight will not stop until freedom is won. The statement also said that the anti-dictatorial fighters are the uprising army of the Nicaraguan people, because it sincerely unites all patriotic strata of Nicaragua and expresses the wishes of the whole people. The statement pointed out that this wish is to "restore democratic life in Nicaragua and establish a republic in which all citizens live peacefully, respecting the rights and opinions of others." The statement expressed the firm determination to overthrow Somoza's tyranny. The statement said that every one of us who sacrifices in battle will cause ten Nicaraguans to join our revolution.

The statement was signed by Commander-in-Chief Enrique Lacayo Farfán, other military commanders, and members of the Nicaraguan Revolutionary Advisory Steering Committee.

The organ of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, "Hoy," published an editorial today paying tribute to the anti-dictatorial fighters of Nicaragua. The editorial pointed out that Nicaragua, with the support of Latin America and the sympathy of the world, will once again become a free country. The editorial said that the struggle may be protracted. But it is not difficult to predict that the Nicaraguan people will eventually win. The cause of tyrants will be dealt another blow, and imperialism will suffer another bankruptcy.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th June dispatch, TASS, New York, 5th June dispatch: The movement against Somoza's dictatorial regime in Nicaragua is intensifying. The domestic situation is tense, and martial law has been declared. The Somoza dictator has dispatched a large number of military police to suppress strikes and anti-government demonstrations. Armed police teams and special forces from the police stations patrol the streets of Managua day and night, and they are making large-scale arrests of people who oppose the dictatorial regime. Domestic newspapers have not been published for several days, and radio stations have stopped broadcasting for several days.

The Somoza regime has issued a general mobilization order and instructed the army to add another two thousand men. Ten thousand reservists have begun special training to prepare for operations against the anti-dictatorial armed forces operating in the central mountainous areas of the country.

Those who have risen up against the Somoza dictatorship are not only the broad masses of people who have suffered inhuman exploitation by American monopoly groups for thirty years, but also a considerable part of the domestic industrial bourgeoisie who correctly believe that the Somoza regime is an obstacle to national economic development. This part of the bourgeoisie is increasingly actively advocating revitalizing the national economy and restoring national sovereignty.

According to American newspapers, the Nicaraguan uprising forces are led by a Revolutionary Advisory Steering Committee established by political exiles. Representatives of intellectual circles, political activists, and industrialists participate in this committee. Not long ago, this committee called on workers, peasants, intellectuals, and all residents to support the movement against the Somoza dictatorship.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 4th June dispatch, the Cuban "July 26th Movement" organ "Revolución" today fiercely criticized the editorial of the US imperialist mouthpiece "The New York Times," which aimed to maintain Somoza's tyranny and oppose the Nicaraguan people's anti-dictatorial struggle.

"Revolución" believes that it is unrealistic for the US State Department to hope that the rule of large landowners and monopoly capitalists in Central America will escape the surging and irresistible revolutionary storm. The newspaper emphasized that Somoza's National Guard has five thousand men trained and armed by Americans; while Batista had sixty-five thousand men, but these people did not play much of a role.

    反独裁的斗争风暴席卷尼加拉瓜
    反政府军坚持武装斗争又占领北部一据点
    反独裁者领袖号召人民拿起武器反对暴政
    新华社5日讯　马那瓜消息：尼加拉瓜反独裁的武装斗争仍然在坚持中，尽管索摩查独裁者早先宣布，他将在两天内平息反政府的武装队伍。据尼加拉瓜反政府方面的电台宣布，5月31日和6月1日进入尼加拉瓜的政治流亡者的反独裁武装队伍最近占领了尼加拉瓜北部的维维利村。同时，山区的许多居民参加了他们的队伍。
    据前些时的消息说，反政府的部队还占领了首都东部和北部的桑托托马、穆伊穆伊和马塔加耳帕附近的据点。
    索摩查在2日晚承认，“战斗进行得很不顺利，因为反政府军很难捉摸”。同时，尽管他一贯把国内的反独裁武装斗争称为“外来侵略”，但他不得不承认，武装部队的绝大多数是尼加拉瓜人。
    新华社哈瓦那4日电哈瓦那的报纸今天刊登了尼加拉瓜反独裁者领袖号召尼加拉瓜人民拿起武器反对索摩查暴政的声明。
    声明表示，反独裁的斗争一定要进行到底，不获得自由，战斗就决不停止。声明又说，反独裁的战士是尼加拉瓜人的起义军，因为它真诚地团结了尼加拉瓜的一切爱国阶层和表达了全民的愿望。声明指出，这个愿望是“恢复尼加拉瓜的民主生活和建立一个共和国，在这个共和国里，全体公民都和平地生活，尊重别人的权利和意见。”声明表示了推翻索摩查暴政的坚定决心。声明说，我们在战斗中牺牲的每一个人将使十个尼加拉瓜人参加我们的革命。
    在声明上签名的有总司令恩里克·拉卡约·法尔方、其他军事指挥官和尼加拉瓜革命咨询指导委员会的委员。
    古巴人民社会党机关报“今日报”今天发表了一篇社论，向尼加拉瓜反独裁的战士致敬。社论指出，得到拉丁美洲支持和世界同情的尼加拉瓜将重新成为自由的国家。社论说，斗争可能是持久的。但是不难预料，尼加拉瓜人民终将获得胜利。暴君们的事业将再一次受到打击，帝国主义将遭到另一次破产。
    新华社5日讯据塔斯社纽约5日讯：尼加拉瓜反对索摩查独裁政权的运动日益强烈。国内呈现紧张局面，已经宣布戒严。索摩查独裁者调遣了大批军警来镇压罢工和反政府游行。马那瓜的各条街道整天整夜都有警察局的武装队伍和特种部队巡逻，并且大肆逮捕反对独裁政权的人。国内各报纸已经几天没有出刊，广播电台停止播音已经数天。
    索摩查政权发布了总动员令，并且指示军队再补充二千人。有一万名后备军人开始受专门训练，准备对活动在国内中部山区的反独裁武装队伍采取作战行动。
    起来反对索摩查独裁的不仅仅是三十年来受尽美国垄断集团奴役的非人剥削的广大人民群众，而且还有国内相当大一部分正确地认为索摩查政权是国家经济发展的阻碍的工业资产阶级。这部分资产阶级愈来愈积极地主张振兴民族经济和恢复民族主权。
    据美国报纸报道，领导尼加拉瓜起义队伍的，是一个由政治流亡者建立的革命咨询指导委员会，参加这个委员会的有知识界代表、政治活动家和工业家。不久以前，这个委员会曾经号召工人、农民和知识分子、全体居民都来支持反对索摩查独裁的运动。
    新华社哈瓦那4日电古巴
  “7月26日运动”机关报“革命报”，今天猛烈地抨击美帝国主义的喉舌“纽约时报”目的在维护索摩查暴政和反对尼加拉瓜人民反独裁斗争的社论。
    “革命报”认为美国国务院希望中美洲的大庄园主和垄断资本家的统治摆脱那种气势澎湃和不可抗拒的革命风暴是不现实的。这家报纸强调指出，索摩查的国民警卫队有五千个由美国人训练和武装起来的人；而巴蒂斯塔有六万五千人，但这些人却没有起多大作用。（附图片）
