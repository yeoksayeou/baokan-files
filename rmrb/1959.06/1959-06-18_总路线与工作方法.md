    General Line and Working Methods
    Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    I. Without Good Working Methods, Work Cannot Be Done Well

    With a correct general line, correct working methods are also necessary. Without correct working methods, the general line cannot be well implemented, and the correct general line will lose its meaning. Therefore, after the general line for socialist construction was correctly put forward, the question of how to concretely implement it, that is, the question of working methods, is seriously placed before us.

    The general line put forward by the Central Committee last year of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" is a Marxist summary and generalization of our country's socialist construction experience, and it is undoubtedly very correct. These dozen or so words put forward by the Central Committee were formulated based on the wishes of the people of the whole country—the strong desire to rapidly and fundamentally change our country's "poor and blank" face and the possibility of objective reality.

    To illustrate the correctness of the general line, we might as well look at it from two aspects. First, from the characteristics of socialist society. Due to the elimination of class exploitation and oppression, the working people have become the masters of society, and people engage in labor to build a happy society and to continuously improve their living standards; due to the elimination of the anarchy of production, the elimination of competition and crisis, replaced by the planned development of social production, the rational utilization of means of production and labor; because the productive forces and the relations of production are basically adapted to each other, and there are no antagonistic social forces, the contradictions that arise in the development can be continuously resolved through internal adjustments; therefore, the development of socialist construction must be at a high speed. This is an objective law. The Party's general line for socialist construction was put forward in accordance with this objective law. Second, from the great achievements made last year. The result of implementing the general line last year was the great leap forward on all fronts. The whole country is like this, and Guangdong is also like this. People are already very familiar with the numbers and examples of these achievements, and there is no need to repeat them. But one point should be pointed out, that is, last year's great leap forward has laid a good foundation for the greater development of all future work, and has given people a great ideological liberation in understanding the objective world, thus further grasping the objective laws of social development and various tasks in our country at the present stage. All these achievements could not have been achieved without the guidance of the general line.

    However, the correctness of the general line does not mean that all problems have been solved. There is still the issue of how to implement it, that is, the issue of whether the work is done well or not. It is true that the general line has a decisive significance for us to accelerate socialist construction, but having it does not mean that socialist construction has already been accelerated. Therefore, the key to the problem lies in whether there are good working methods to realize this general line. How to go all out, how to aim high, to what extent to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, all must be specified according to different times, places, and conditions. For example, greater, faster, better, and more economical results are also relative. It is to try to do more, faster, better, and more economically under the same conditions, rather than unconditionally greater, faster, better, and more economical regardless of the specific circumstances. From the perspective of industry, Guangdong and the northeastern provinces should be different. My province has a very poor industrial base, while the northeast is our country's heavy industrial zone. Therefore, on the issue of heavy industrial development, we cannot demand the same from our province as from the northeastern provinces. Each province has its own specific circumstances, and the central government's general line should be implemented through different specific forms and different specific methods. If we do not proceed from the specific conditions of the local area and do not improve our working methods well, then we cannot implement the general line well.

    From a general point of view, Guangdong has resolutely implemented the central government's general line. Therefore, like other provinces, we have achieved tremendous achievements last year without exception. The current problem is how to improve our working methods to better implement the general line and make our achievements greater.

    II. How to Correctly Understand Objective Reality

    The question of working methods is the question of how to correctly understand objective reality and transform objective reality on this basis.

    Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" pointed out a fundamental method for us to understand the objective world. The now proposed methods such as "deliberating carefully and deciding wisely," "being good at observing the situation," and "making decisive decisions" are all issues of the theory of knowledge of dialectical materialism. For example, what is "deliberating carefully and deciding wisely"? The main thing is to be able to discover the contradictions of things, and to find the main contradiction and the main aspect of this contradiction, and then make judgments to solve them. To deliberate carefully, it is necessary to study the actual situation and discover problems; to decide wisely, it is necessary to analyze the situation, judge the situation, and find the main contradiction from a pile of problems and solve it. Therefore, although "deliberating carefully and deciding wisely" cannot be completely separated, it actually contains two meanings.

    It is easy to say, but it is not easy to truly discover contradictions from complex things, grasp the main contradiction and its main aspects, and make correct judgments. For example, needs and possibilities, the immediate interests of the masses and the long-term interests of the country, soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis, tension and relaxation, balance and imbalance are all opposing (contradictory) and unified. But it is not easy to emphasize which aspect to emphasize according to different periods and different situations, that is, to grasp the main contradictory aspect at that time and place. Because objective things are ever-changing, situations are complex and diverse, and there are also many illusions. Contradictions are sometimes covered up and cannot be seen through at a glance, and sometimes they are even seen wrong. In fact, this is not surprising, because the objective is infinite, and our subjective understanding is limited (restricted by certain historical conditions and scientific knowledge). The understanding of the objective is relative and incomplete. Therefore, after we have decided on a policy, we must not think that everything is going well, but also test it through practice, to supplement or change it. We cannot think that seeing a problem is suddenly true and cannot be changed. If you think this way, it violates the theory of knowledge of dialectical materialism and will make mistakes. Failing to emphasize supplementing or changing the established measures in the process of practice according to the needs of the objective situation is ideological rigidity, and doing things this way is bound to fail.

    Therefore, the method of practice is the fundamental method for us to correctly understand objective reality.

    The practice mentioned here does not refer to the practice of a few people, but mainly refers to the practice of the masses. So in essence, the question of working methods is still a question of the mass line. All the work of our Party can only be successful through the method of the mass line, raising the awareness of the masses, organizing the masses, and giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses. It can be said that if what we do is truly beneficial to the masses, and truly mobilizes the masses, and the majority of the masses tell us what they think, then it is probably a relatively correct practice. On the contrary, some things have not mobilized the broad masses, but have only gained the support of a small number of people, and the masses may sometimes say a few words of "support" verbally, but this is definitely not a correct practice.

    III. The Question of Subjective Initiative

    Knowing the objective is a matter of subjective reflection of the objective; subjective initiative refers to the role of people in knowing the objective and transforming the objective.

    Subjective initiative is needed at all times. One of the greatest characteristics of communists is the strong subjective desire to transform the world. On the basis of respecting objective reality, they try to give full play to subjective initiative and never show powerlessness in the face of objective reality. Dialectical materialism differs from mechanical materialism in that it does not believe that objective conditions are static and immutable, but believes that subjective initiative can change objective conditions and create objective conditions. It is difficult to imagine that a person who does not have a strong desire to change our country's "poor and blank" face and does not fully exert subjective initiative in his work can do a good job. However, subjective initiative can only be the best (not second best, let alone bad) efforts made to achieve a goal within the scope of objective possibility. Exceeding this limit, ignoring the possibility of objective reality, and excessively emphasizing subjective initiative will develop into a tendency of idealism. For example, in this year's late rice production in Guangdong, everyone gave play to their subjective initiative, and the province strived for an average yield of 700 or 800 jin per mu, and 1,000 jin per mu in high-yield fields, which is possible. It is wrong to relax efforts in this regard; but if, like many counties last year, it is proposed to achieve an average yield of 3,000 jin, 5,000 jin, or even 10,000 jin per mu, then it is impossible under the existing conditions, and it will not be possible to give play to subjective initiative. It is not okay to fail to do what can be done with the greatest effort; conversely, it is not okay to insist on doing what cannot be done. Therefore, both aspects must be talked about. Emphasizing subjective initiative can prevent right-leaning conservatism; often respecting objective possibilities and paying attention to "leaving room for maneuver" can prevent "left-leaning" adventurism. Saying that both aspects should be talked about, of course, does not mean advocating "reciting" the "scriptures" of both aspects at all times, but emphasizing a certain aspect according to the actual needs of a certain period, which requires mastering the "degree," that is, the need to make a Marxist concrete analysis of things. For example, before September last year, emphasizing subjective initiative was very necessary, otherwise there would be no such great achievements; but after September, everyone's subjective initiative has already been greatly developed, and emphasizing "leaving room for maneuver" has become very necessary again. In the process of understanding things, "excess" and "deficiency" are common phenomena. Therefore, when difficulties block people's progress and show timidity, emphasizing subjective initiative is very necessary; but when difficulties have begun to be overcome and work can be carried out smoothly, proposing "leaving room for maneuver" becomes very necessary. The same is true for treating a person. For those who are blindly optimistic, we should mention "leaving room for maneuver" more often; for those who are listless, we should mention subjective initiative more often.

    Comrades with right-leaning conservative ideas often emphasize objective conditions and make objective conditions absolute. We recognize the important significance of objective conditions. Objective conditions are generally indispensable, and sometimes even play a decisive role. For example, the farming conditions in the Chaoshan area and the Hainan area are different. These conditions will play a role in grain production for a certain period of time. Naturally, these conditions will slowly transform, but before the transformation, it will still play a role. Ignoring it and ignoring it will make a mistake of subjectivism. When deciding on policies, we must fully consider the conditions in all aspects, consider the aspects that promote each other, and also consider the aspects that restrict each other. In this way, our decisions will be more in line with reality. However, we must never make objective conditions absolute, thinking that conditions are unchangeable and that the subjective is powerless to the objective. This is an isolated and mechanical attitude towards objective conditions; people who hold this attitude only emphasize difficulties when doing work, and frown and are at a loss in the face of difficulties. Of course, there is no question of subjective initiative, and it is even more difficult to find a way to overcome all difficulties and forge ahead bravely. Therefore, in these comrades, we must first eliminate their "theory of conditions" and then ask him to proceed from reality. Of course, to do any work well, we must treat objective conditions from two aspects. On the one hand, we must respect objective conditions and emphasize proceeding from reality and from specific conditions; but on the other hand, we must also see people's subjective initiative and not regard objective conditions as fixed and immutable things. After subjective efforts, objective conditions can be changed. This is the viewpoint of dialectical materialism.

    To give full play to subjective initiative, we must emphasize the great role of people in transforming the world. Our emphasis on subjective initiative today also has a basis in objective conditions. This basis is the 600 million people who have been liberated. They understand that although our country's current production level is very low, the potential is extremely great and there is much to be done; they also understand that today everyone is the master of society, and the faster socialist construction is, the sooner everyone's life can be improved. Therefore, everyone dares to despise difficulties and is full of energy. As long as objective conditions allow, we will definitely do 100% of the effort if possible, and not 99.9%. This desire and spirit of the people is a high degree of exertion of people's subjective initiative and is the source of the power to overcome all difficulties. Therefore, we oppose the views of those who "see things but not people" and do not believe in the great significance of launching mass movements in socialist construction at any time. However, our emphasis on people's subjective initiative is put forward on a certain material basis. If, because of opposing "seeing things but not people," we go to the other extreme of "seeing people but not things," that is also wrong.

    To correctly understand subjective initiative and see both things and people, we must also make a concrete analysis of some of the slogans put forward by the masses during the great leap forward last year. Last year, in a situation of ideological liberation and soaring enthusiasm, in order to strive for a large increase in agricultural production, everyone put forward inspiring slogans such as "How daring people are, how high the land yields," "Only afraid of not thinking, not afraid of not being able to do it," and "Man will conquer nature." It should be said that these inspiring slogans, although not complete and prone to problems if interpreted improperly, still played a good role in last year's great leap forward. For example, in the past, in our minds, grain production could only increase by a few percent each year. However, last year, everyone dared to think and dared to do, and the result was that the increase was not a few percent, nor more than a dozen percent, but dozens of percent. Imagine, without such "courage," could the land increase so much "yield"? If you don't think about it at all, can you do it? Of course it is impossible. Therefore, such slogans must also be understood comprehensively. Naturally, if they are not explained or it is not understood under what circumstances and for what problems they were put forward, it will produce one-sidedness and develop into idealism. Because what is thought of ideologically may not necessarily be realized, and what plays a decisive role is the material basis and objective laws. If we do not consider the specific conditions objectively and do not act in accordance with objective laws, and want to produce 10,000 jin of rice per mu with today's agricultural production level, then it is naturally impossible, and if we insist on doing it, we will only hit a wall. However, we must not simply think that these slogans are all idealistic and therefore write them off. The question is how we understand these slogans. For example, the "courage" that people should have should refer to the meaning of achieving the greatest results under the objective conditions allowed when a person has a full understanding of objective laws and when he analyzes the subjective and objective conditions. If it is such "courage," then why not want it? And with such "courage," the land may indeed produce the yield he wants to achieve, because his "courage" is in line with objective reality. "Only afraid of not thinking, not afraid of not being able to do it" should also be understood in this way. The Soviets made planets go into space and fly close to the moon, which was also "thought" of first and then "done." If we think that going to the moon is just a myth, then we will never fly to the moon. The question is to have a scientific basis when thinking. "Man will conquer nature" is also the same. It expresses people's high morale and spirit of not being afraid of difficulties; it expresses people's determination to conquer nature. Of course, if you only look at it literally and interpret it as we are now fully capable of conquering nature, and as long as we dare to think and dare to do, we can no longer be restricted by the laws of nature, then that is certainly wrong.

    Related to giving play to subjective initiative are the relationship between needs and possibilities, and the relationship between desires and reality. We have always emphasized needs and valued the needs of the masses. Without a need as a driving force, it is difficult to imagine how we can move forward. Building a communist society in China and even in the world is our greatest and strongest need. For this need, how many martyrs shed their blood one after another. In a certain period of time, we must also put forward our specific needs as a driving force for progress and as a prospect for struggle. However, we must also be soberly aware that needs are not equal to possibilities. Therefore, we must gradually meet our needs according to the possibilities that can be achieved objectively. Sometimes some comrades mix needs and possibilities together, do not consider subjective and objective conditions, and blindly do it, which can easily lead to problems.

    Moreover, possibility is only a possibility. Possibility is not equal to realization. To transform possibility into reality, it is necessary to have a certain basis and conditions, and to go through subjective efforts. There can be several possibilities at the same time (so our decisions have upper, middle, and lower strategies, and there are one, two, and three books of accounts). Whether the best possibility, that is, the possibility that is most beneficial to us, can be realized depends on our subjective efforts and the formation of objective conditions.

    The relationship between desire and reality is also the same. The 600 million people of the whole country have a strong desire, that is, to rapidly change our country's "poor and blank" face. This is a very important driving force. We must understand and cherish this desire, and try every means to realize everyone's desire as soon as possible, otherwise we cannot be called revolutionaries. But this is only a desire, and desire cannot replace reality. We should proceed from the actual situation and, through hard work, realize this desire step by step.

    IV. The Issue of Speed and Proportion in Socialist Construction

    The issue of speed and proportion is an issue of objective law and a major issue that we must correctly resolve in socialist construction. Because if this issue is resolved well, there will be no major problems in socialist construction; if it is not resolved well, there will be major problems.

    Both speed and proportion have their objective laws. We can only truthfully acknowledge it and realize it, and cannot arbitrarily change it or violate it. The so-called problem is because of violating objective laws.

    Regarding the speed issue. The speed of socialist construction is the speed of leap forward. It is different from the development speed of any society in the past. However, leap forward is also relative, and there is no meaning of accelerating indefinitely. If we only see the soaring enthusiasm of the 600 million people of the whole country, but do not see the limitations in these aspects, and try to "reach the sky in one step," then not only will it not be realized, but it will only be frustrated. Last year, we engaged in a few so-called "satellite fields" and wanted a yield of 50,000 jin of rice per mu, which belongs to this nature.

    In short, the speed of socialist construction is the speed of leap forward, and this speed is still a certain speed under the conditions allowed. If this problem is not resolved well, mistakes of either right or "left" will be made sooner or later. Guangdong was slower in 1957 due to the influence of "anti-rash advance," and in the second half of 1958, it went too far in some aspects. The reason is that it did not master the objective law of speed well. Some construction speeds will be slowed down this year, but they must not be as slow as in 1957, otherwise, mistakes will also be made.

    Regarding the proportion issue. The development of socialist construction is proportional. Planned and proportional development is an important aspect of socialist system superiority and one of the most superior manifestations of the capitalist system.

    The problem of proportion should be considered from two aspects. On the one hand, it is the direct need of people in society; on the other hand, it is the need for the development of social production. For example, in terms of steel production and cotton cloth production, from the perspective of our country's century-old plan and from the perspective of rapidly changing our country's "poor and blank" face, producing more steel is undoubtedly very beneficial to us, but this must also be proportional. We cannot emphasize steel production to an unlimited extent. Taking Guangdong as an example, steel production can leap from a situation of no foundation in the past to 40,000 tons (referring to foreign steel), and cotton cloth can be enough for everyone to wear, but we must never leap steel production to one million tons and make it impossible for people to make a set of clothes. This is the proportion problem.

    In the proportion issue of socialist construction, the proportion between industry and agriculture and between heavy industry and light industry is a major issue that needs to be resolved first.

    Industry and agriculture are interdependent. Without the growth of grain and without a sufficient supply of industrial raw materials, it is impossible to develop industry quickly. The significant increase in industrial production in our country in the past few years is closely related to the agricultural harvest of the previous year. But, conversely, if agriculture wants to have great development, it cannot do without the support of industry. Mechanization, electrification, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, etc., are impossible without industry. However, the development between them is contradictory. Not to mention anything else, the investment of manpower, material resources, and financial resources is contradictory. This is essentially a proportion issue. Guangdong has a weak industrial base, and we must use every possibility to do more industry. We should invest more manpower, material resources, and financial resources as much as possible; but we must also see that without the corresponding development of agriculture, it is impossible to build a very solid industrial foundation all at once. Specifically, in terms of agriculture, we must thoroughly solve the grain problem, and it is impossible for Guangdong to thoroughly solve the grain problem without 60 billion jin per year; and we must generally stabilize it to ensure that there is indeed so much grain every year, instead of being loose one year and tight one year. To achieve this, we must vigorously grasp agriculture in the next two or three years. We must still resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the main focus. As long as agriculture (mainly grain) is truly and thoroughly solved, we can let go to develop industry. This seems to be not active enough in the development of industry on the surface, but from the actual situation, it is very active, because it is difficult to imagine that a province can give priority to developing industry (especially heavy industry) well in a weak foundation before thoroughly solving the grain problem.

    Giving priority to the development of heavy industry, ensuring the priority growth of means of production, and continuously expanding reproduction is an objective economic law. Because without the development of heavy industry, agricultural electrification and mechanization cannot be realized, and light industry will not be able to develop fully because it cannot increase machines. Especially in our country, where the foundation of heavy industry was very weak in the past, it is even more necessary to give priority to the development of heavy industry. But this also has a proportion to the development of light industry. Because they both promote and restrict each other. If any sector produces too much and too fast, it will squeeze out another sector, which will inevitably cause imbalance. It was originally intended to advance rapidly, but the result will be slower or even regressive. That is of course not what we want, and we must try our best to avoid it. It is from this meaning that we must often adjust the relationship between the two. But this relationship can only be adjusted in development. Some people are too afraid of imbalance and tension, and think that they can achieve a new balance without any tension. That is an unrealistic idea. It is the idea of people who do not understand the law of the development of things. If we do it according to their ideas, the cause of socialist construction will stop or proceed very slowly.

    Naturally, proportional development does not mean that each department is developing equally. This is impossible. It is impossible to maintain a fixed ratio and static balance between the various departments. Especially in a country like ours with a backward economy to build socialism, it is even less strange that imbalances occur frequently. From balance to imbalance, and from imbalance to balance, is a normal form in economic development. This is opposing and unified. Without the dialectical relationship between balance and imbalance, work cannot progress. But this does not mean that the more unbalanced the development, the better. If a certain department develops to exceed the maximum limit allowed by the objective proportion, what is achieved will not be a new balance, but an imbalance. Of course, we do not need that, and we must try our best to avoid it. It is from this meaning that we must often adjust the relationship between the two. But this relationship can only be adjusted in development. Some people are too afraid of imbalance and afraid of tension, thinking that they can achieve a new balance without any tension. That is an unrealistic idea. It is the idea of people who do not understand the law of the development of things. If we do it according to their ideas, the cause of socialist construction will stop or proceed very slowly.

    V. Investigation and Research and Everything Through Experiment

    Investigation and research and everything through experiment are important methods in our working methods. For materialists, this is a fundamental method in work. The questions mentioned earlier about how to understand objective existence, how to give play to subjective initiative, and how to correctly solve the speed and proportion of socialist construction cannot be done well without investigation and research and everything through experiment. The saying that there is no right to speak without investigation and research is to criticize those who only rely on subjective work. However, we should also see that investigation and research always carry more or less subjective opinions. Therefore, the results may not be completely in line with the objective reality. If a decision is made on the overall work all at once based on the situation from investigation and research, there will often be many places that are not practical. On the one hand, this is because we have subjective opinions when doing investigation and research, which are not completely in line with the objective reality; on the other hand, it is also because different regions have different conditions and different situations, and it is impossible for the decision made based on the results of investigation and research in one point to be in line with the actual situation in all regions. Of course, in general, from the basic aspects, many problems have universality. This point cannot be denied, otherwise no decisions can be made. However, when various regions implement this decision, they must combine it with the local situation. To combine well, everything must be through experiment. Therefore, from this meaning, investigation and research and everything through experiment complement each other. They are all necessary stages and important processes in work. They are the fundamental method in our work and the fundamental method for subjective understanding of the objective.

    Investigation and research must truly discover problems. Should there be subjective opinions when investigating? Yes, there should be. Because we cannot be like red-headed flies, bumping around to find problems. However, when the discovered problem is inconsistent with our own subjective opinions, we must be good at giving up our subjective opinions. Only in this way can we be materialists. There are two situations that easily occur during investigation and research. One situation is that when he discovers that the actual situation is different from the subjective opinions he held at the beginning, he is still unwilling to give up his prejudices, but tries his best to find materials that are beneficial to his subjective opinions (regardless of whether these materials are universal or individual) to prove that his subjective opinions are "correct." It should be said that this has lost the meaning of investigation and research from the most fundamental point. Another situation is that after he discovers the problem, he "stops at the surface" and is satisfied with the superficial fragments he has discovered, and does not delve deeper, so he cannot discover the essence of the problem, thereby making better decisions and promoting our work. This is related to our working style being insufficiently arduous and in-depth.

    Chairman Mao has always emphasized the working method of everything through experiment, from experiment to promotion, from point to surface. Facts have proved that wherever this method is implemented, its work must be both active and prudent; on the contrary, wherever this method is forgotten, its work is either "overdone" or "not enough." During the early rice planting this year, when we promoted direct seeding or planting japonica rice, we did not go through experiments, but spread it all at once, resulting in some losses, which was because we did not implement everything through experiment.

    In terms of work, why do we emphasize "everything through experiment" so much? Because it is difficult for us to understand a new thing (such as a new variety, a new measure) very clearly at once, and sometimes we even understand it wrong. This situation is unavoidable in work. But if we adopt the method of everything through experiment and promote it only after the experiment is successful, not only can we avoid the losses suffered in the agricultural technology reform pointed out earlier, but also because we have experiments and constantly summarize successful experiences, we can constantly improve. The process of continuous experimentation, continuous summarization, and continuous promotion is also the process of continuously deepening the understanding of the laws of nature, the relationship between man and nature, and the relationship between people through practice. And this is exactly the Marxist-Leninist ideology and working method that Chairman Mao told us in "On Practice."

    In terms of agriculture, emphasizing everything through experiment can implement the requirements of adapting to local conditions, adapting to the time, and adapting to people. For example, for advanced measures such as deep plowing and close planting, in general, everyone will not have any different opinions, but specifically, to what extent a certain soil should be deeply ploughed and to what extent it should be closely planted, there can only be a general requirement, and it is impossible to set a common standard. To achieve a bumper harvest, we must take these advanced measures, but we must also proceed cautiously. Therefore, we must emphasize going through experiments and promoting it after success. For example, whether japonica rice should be planted, how should it be planted, and when should it be planted, it is different in northern Guangdong and Hainan, not to mention the northeast and Guangdong. Therefore, how to proceed from the specific situation and adopt the method of everything through experiment to guide agricultural production is a method that is both active and prudent, and it is also a concrete manifestation of a cautious leadership style.

    Does our emphasis on "everything through experiment," "adapting to local conditions," and "proceeding from specific conditions" mean that we do not value the advanced experiences of other regions? Of course not. This principle has been explained earlier. If other regions have advanced experiences, they can help us grasp the laws of objective things and save our energy. Of course, we cannot fail to value and learn from them. However, when learning, we must first go through experiments. Based on the results of the experiments, we will then decide how to promote it. We must not blindly accept it and promote it rashly. Part of our direct-seeded rice and japonica rice suffered losses, which was the result of this.

    When promoting experience, of course, we are promoting advanced experience. But when we summarize experience, we need to value both good typical examples (which are the main ones) and bad typical examples. Because things always have two sides. If we only summarize advanced experience and only see the advanced side, our understanding will be incomplete. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to the backward aspects, and we should pay more attention to them in the future.

    总路线与工作方法
    中共广东省委第一书记　陶铸
    一、没有好的工作方法，不能做好工作
    有了正确的总路线，还要有正确的工作方法。没有正确的工作方法，便不能很好地贯彻执行总路线，正确的总路线就会失去意义。因此，在社会主义建设的总路线被正确地提出来以后，如何加以具体执行的工作方法问题，便严重地摆在我们面前。
    中央去年提出的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，是我国社会主义建设经验的马克思主义的总结和概括，无疑地是非常正确的。中央提出来的这十几个字，是根据全国人民的愿望——迅速地根本改变我国“一穷二白”面貌的强烈愿望和客观实际的可能制定的。
    为了说明总路线的正确性，我们不妨从两个方面来看。首先从社会主义社会的特点来看。由于消灭了阶级的剥削与压迫，劳动人民成了社会的主人，人们从事劳动是为了建成幸福的社会，是为了不断提高自己的生活水平；由于消灭了生产的无政府状态，消灭了竞争和危机，代替它们的是社会生产的有计划发展，生产资料和劳动力的合理利用；由于生产力与生产关系基本上是相适应的，并且不存在对抗性的社会力量，因而在发展中出现的矛盾可以通过内部调整不断地得到解决；所以，社会主义建设的发展必然是高速度的。这是客观法则。党的社会主义建设总路线就是遵循着这一客观法则提出来的。其次，从去年所取得的伟大成就来看。去年贯彻执行总路线的结果，就是各个战线上的大跃进。全国如此，广东也是如此。这些成就的数字和事例人们已很熟悉，用不着再来重复。但有一点应该指出来，就是去年的大跃进，已为今后各项工作的更大发展奠定了良好的基础，使人们在认识客观世界方面，也得到了一个思想大解放，因而更进一步地掌握了我国现阶段社会发展和各项工作的客观规律。所有这一切成就，没有总路线的指导，是不可能取得的。
    但是，总路线正确，并不等于一切问题都解决了。这里还有一个如何贯彻执行的问题，也就是工作做得好坏的问题。不错，总路线对我们加速建设社会主义具有决定性的意义，但有了它决不等于已经加速了社会主义建设，因此，问题的关键就在于有没有好的工作方法来实现这一总路线。鼓足干劲怎样鼓法，力争上游怎样争法，多快好省做到什么程度，都要根据不同的时间、地点、条件把它们具体化起来。譬如多快好省，也是比较而言的，是要在同一的条件下尽量做得更多更快更好更省，而不是不问具体情况无限制地多快好省。从工业来说，广东和东北各省就应有所不同。我省工业基础很差，东北则是我国的重工业区，因之在重工业发展的问题上，我们就不能拿要求于东北各省的来要求于本省。每个省有每个省的具体情况，应该通过不同的具体形式和不同的具体方法来贯彻执行中央的总路线。如果不根据当地的具体情况，不很好地改进自己的工作方法，那就不能很好地把总路线实现。
    从总的方面看来，广东执行中央的总路线是很坚决的，因此我们和别的省一样，去年一年，无例外地取得了巨大的成绩。现在的问题，是如何改进我们的工作方法，使总路线执行得更好，使我们的成就更大。
    二、怎样正确认识客观存在
    工作方法问题，就是怎样正确认识客观存在并在这个基础上改造客观存在的问题。
    毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”，给我们指出了认识客观世界的一个根本方法。现在提出的“多谋善断”、“善于观察形势”、“当机立断”等方法，也都是辩证唯物论的认识论问题。比如，什么叫“多谋善断”呢？主要就是要能发现事物的矛盾，并能找出其中的主要矛盾和这个矛盾的主要方面，然后作出判断来加以解决。要多谋就要研究实际，发现问题；要善断就要分析情况，判断情况，从一大堆问题中找出主要矛盾，并加以解决。所以“多谋善断”虽然不能截然分开，但它实际上是包含了两个意思的。
    这样说起来容易，但真正能从繁杂的事物中发现矛盾、抓住主要矛盾及其主要方面并做出正确的判断，是不容易的。譬如需要与可能、群众的眼前利益与国家的长远利益、冲天干劲与科学分析、紧张与松弛、平衡与不平衡，都是对立（矛盾）而又统一的，但要根据不同的时期，不同的情况，来强调其中的哪一方面，也就是抓住当时当地的主要的矛盾方面，是不容易的。因为客观的事物是千变万化的，情况是复杂多端的，而且还存在着许许多多的假象，矛盾有时候被掩盖着，往往不能一眼望穿，有时候甚至会看错。其实，这也并不奇怪，因为客观是无限的，而我们的主观认识是有限的（受一定的历史条件和科学知识的限制），对客观的认识是相对的，是不完全的。因此，我们决定了一个方针政策之后，决不可认为万事大吉，而还要通过实践来考验它，来加以补充或改变。我们不能认为看到一个问题，一下子就是千真万确的了，认为不能再改变的了。如果这样想，是违反辩证唯物论的认识论的，是会犯错误的。不强调在实践过程中，随着客观形势的需要来补充或改变既定的措施，就是思想僵化，这样做事情是没有不失败的。
    因此，实践的方法，是我们正确地认识客观存在的根本方法。
    这里所说的实践，不是指少数人的实践，而主要地是指群众的实践。所以本质地说，工作方法问题还是一个群众路线的问题。我们党的一切工作，只有通过群众路线的方法，提高群众觉悟，把群众组织起来，发挥群众的积极性，才有可能做得成功。可以这样说，如果我们做的事情真正能对群众有利，真正把群众调动起来，大多数群众和我们讲心坎里的话，那大概就是比较正确的实践。相反，有些事情广大群众没有调动起来，只是得到小部分人的拥护，群众有时也可能在口头上讲一两句“拥护”的话，但这肯定地不能算是正确的实践。
    三、主观能动性问题
    认识客观是主观反映客观的问题；主观能动性就是指的人认识客观和改造客观的作用。
    主观能动性是什么时候都需要的。共产党人最大的特点之一就是对改造世界有强烈的主观愿望，在尊重客观实际的基础上，尽量发挥主观能动性，在客观实际面前从不表现无能为力。辩证唯物论与机械唯物论不同，就在于它不认为客观条件是静止的，一成不变的，而是认为主观能动性是可以改变客观条件并创造客观条件的。很难设想，一个人对改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌没有强烈的愿望，在工作中不充分发挥主观能动性就能做好工作。但是，主观能动性只能是在客观可能的范围内，为达到一种目的所做的最好的（不是次好的，更不是不好的）努力。超过这个界限，不顾客观实际的可能，过分强调了主观能动性，就会发展为唯心主义的倾向。譬如广东今年晚造水稻生产，大家发挥主观能动性，全省争取平均亩产七、八百斤，丰产田千把斤，是可能的，放松了这方面的努力是错误的；但是如果像去年有不少县那样，提出要平均亩产达到三千斤、五千斤，甚至一万斤，那在现有的条件来看就是不可能的，再发挥主观能动性也办不到。尽最大努力能办到的，而不去办不行；相反，不能办到的硬要去办也不行。因此这两方面都要讲。强调主观能动性，可以防止右倾保守；经常尊重客观可能，注意“留有余地”，可以防止
  “左”倾冒险。说两方面都讲，当然不是主张什么时候都“念”这两方面的“经”，而是要根据一定的时期的实际需要，强调某一个方面，这就要掌握“火候”，也就是需要对事物做马克思主义的具体分析。譬如去年9月以前，强调主观能动性非常必要，不然就不可能有那么大的成绩；但在9月后，大家主观能动性都已经有了很大发挥，强调“留有余地”又成为非常必要的了。在认识事物的过程中，“过”与“不及”是经常有的现象，所以当困难挡住人们前进，表现畏缩的时候，强调主观能动性十分必要；但当困难已开始被克服，工作能顺利开展的时候，提出“留有余地”就变得十分必要。对待一个人也是如此。对盲目乐观的人要多提“留有余地”；对萎靡不振的人要多提主观能动性。
    具有右倾保守思想的同志，常常是强调客观条件，并且把客观条件绝对化起来。我们是承认客观条件的重要意义的，客观条件一般地说是不可缺少的，有时甚至起决定性的作用。譬如潮汕地区和海南地区的耕作条件就有所不同，这些条件在一定时期内，对粮食生产将起作用。自然，这些条件慢慢会转化，但在未转化之前它还是要起作用的，忽视它，不管它，就会犯主观主义的错误。当决定方针政策时，要充分地考虑到各方面的条件，考虑它们相互促进的方面，也考虑它们相互制约的方面，这样，就会使我们的决策能够比较切合实际。但是，绝不能把客观条件绝对化起来，认为条件是不可改变的，主观对客观是无能为力的，这是孤立地、机械地对待客观条件的态度；抱有这种态度的人，他们在做工作时，只有强调困难，在困难面前愁眉苦脸，一筹莫展，当然谈不到什么主观能动性，更难找到排除万难，奋勇直前的方法了。所以，在这些同志的身上，首先要破除他的“唯条件论”，然后再叫他从实际出发。当然，要做好任何工作，对待客观条件都要从两方面着手，一方面是尊重客观条件，强调从实际出发，从具体条件出发；但另方面，也要看到人的主观能动性，不把客观条件看成固定不变的东西，经过主观努力，客观条件是可以改变的。这才是辩证唯物论的观点。
    要发挥主观能动性，就必须强调人在改造世界中的伟大作用。我们今天强调主观能动性，也是有客观条件的基础的，这基础就是获得了解放的六亿人民。他们懂得，我国目前生产水平尽管很低，但潜力极大，大有可为；他们也懂得，今天大家已是社会的主人，社会主义建设快一天，大家的生活就能快一点得到改善。因此大家敢于藐视困难，干劲冲天，只要客观允许办到十分，决不办到九分九。人民群众这种愿望，这种气概，就是人的主观能动性的高度发挥，是克服一切困难的力量的源泉。所以对那些“见物不见人”，不相信在社会主义建设中大搞群众运动的伟大意义的人们，我们什么时候都反对他们这种观点。但是，我们这样强调人的主观能动性是在一定的物质基础上提出来的，如果因为反对“见物不见人”而走到“见人不见物”的另一个反面去，那也是不对的。
    要正确地理解主观能动性和既见物又见人，对去年大跃进时群众提出来的一些口号，也要加以具体分析。去年，在思想解放，干劲冲天的情况下，大家为了争取农业上的大增产，曾提出：“人有多大胆，地有多高产”、“只怕想不到，不怕办不到”，以及“人定胜天”等鼓舞人心、鼓舞人奋勇直前的口号。应该说，这些鼓舞人心的口号，虽然不够完整，在解释不当的情况下会出毛病，但它对去年的大跃进仍然起了不少良好作用。譬如说，过去在我们心目中，粮食增产只能是每年递增百分之几，但是，在去年，大家敢想敢干，结果增产不是百分之几，也不是百分之十几；而是百分之几十。试设想，如果没有这样的“胆”，土地能增出这么多“产”来吗？如果根本想不到，能够办得到吗？当然是不可能的。所以，对这样一些口号也要全面地来理解。自然，如果不加解说也不去了解它们是在什么情况下针对什么问题提出的，就会产生片面性，发展为唯心主义。因为思想上想到的事，并不一定能实现，而起决定作用的还是物质基础，还是客观规律。如果我们不顾客观上的具体条件，不按照客观规律办事，以今天农业生产水平，想每亩稻谷产一万斤，那自然是不可能的，硬是要做下去，就只有碰钉子。但是，我们决不能因此就简单地认为这些口号都是唯心主义的，因而一律抹煞。问题是我们对这些口号做怎样的理解。譬如人要有胆的“胆”，应该是指的当一个人对客观规律已经有了充分的认识，当他分析了主客观条件之后，要在客观条件允许下取得最大成绩的意思，如果是这样的“胆”，那为什么不要呢？而且有了这样的“胆”，土地的确也有可能产生他所想达到的产量的，因为他的“胆”是符合客观实际的。“只怕想不到，不怕办不到”也应该做如是理解。苏联人造行星上天，飞近月亮，也是先“想”到，然后才“办”到的，假如我们认为到月亮上去只是神话，那就永远不会飞到月亮上去，问题是在想的时候要有科学根据。“人定胜天”也是如此，它表现了人们的意气昂扬、不怕困难的精神面貌；它表现了人们对征服自然的决心。当然，如果只从字面上看，把它解释为我们现在已经完全可以征服自然了，只要我们敢想敢干，就可以再不受自然规律的限制了，那当然也是不对的。
    与发挥主观能动性相联系着的，还有需要与可能，愿望与实际的关系问题。我们一向是非常强调需要并重视群众的需要的。如果没有一种需要做为动力，很难设想我们怎样前进。在中国甚至在全世界建设共产主义社会，这是我们最大的最强烈的需要，为了这个需要，前仆后继，流了多少烈士们的鲜血。在一定时期内，我们还一定要提出我们的具体的需要来，作为前进的动力，作为奋斗的前景。但是，我们也要清醒地看到，需要并不等于可能，所以就要根据客观实际所能达到的可能去逐步满足我们的需要。有时候有的同志把需要与可能混在一起，不考虑主客观条件，盲目干去，就容易出问题。
    而且可能也仅仅是一种可能而已，可能还不等于已经实现，要使可能性转化成为现实性，还要具备一定的根据和条件，并且经过主观的努力。可能性同时可以有几个的（所以我们的决策有上策、中策、下策，账有一、二、三本），是否能够实现最好的即对我们最有利的可能性，还要看我们主观的努力和客观条件的形成。
    愿望与实际的关系也是如此。全国六亿人民都有一个强烈的愿望，那就是迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌。这是一个非常重要的动力，我们必须懂得并珍视这一愿望，要想尽一切办法尽快地实现大家这一愿望，不然就称不上是革命者。但这仅只是一个愿望，愿望不能代替实际，我们应该从实际情况出发，经过艰苦努力，有步骤地去实现这一愿望。
    四、建设社会主义的速度与比例问题
    速度与比例问题是客观法则问题，是我们建设社会主义必须正确解决的重大问题。因为这个问题解决得好，在建设社会主义当中，大体上就不会出大毛病；解决不好，就会出大毛病。
    速度与比例都有它的客观法则。只能如实地承认它、实现它，不能任意改变它，违背它。所谓出毛病，就是违背客观法则的原故。
    关于速度问题。社会主义建设的速度是跃进的速度。它不同于过去任何社会的发展速度。但是，跃进也是比较而言的，决没有无限度加速的意思。如果我们只看到全国六亿人民的冲天干劲，而看不到这些方面的限制，企图“一步登天”，那不但不能实现，而且只会受到挫折。去年我们搞了少数所谓“卫星田”，要稻谷亩产五万斤，就是属于这一性质的。
    总之，社会主义建设的速度是跃进的速度，而这个速度仍然是在条件允许之下的一定的速度。这个问题解决不好，迟早会犯或右或“左”的错误。广东1957年因受“反冒进”影响，慢了一些，1958年下半年在某些方面又过了一些，原因都是没有很好地掌握速度的客观法则。今年有些建设的速度要放慢一些，但决不能像1957年那样慢，否则，那也是要犯错误的。
    关于比例问题。社会主义建设的发展是按比例的。有计划、按比例地发展，是社会主义制度优越性的一个重要方面，是比资本主义制度无比优越的集中表现之一。
    考虑比例问题要从两个方面出发。一方面是社会上人的直接需要；另一方面是社会生产发展的需要。譬如，钢铁的生产和棉布的生产，从我国百年大计来说，从迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌来说，多生产一些钢铁，无疑是对我们非常有利的，但这也要有比例，不能把钢铁生产强调到无限制的程度。以广东来说，钢铁生产可以由过去毫无基础的情况下跃进到四万吨（指洋钢），棉布可以够每人穿衣之用就行，但决不能把钢铁生产跃进到一百万吨，而使人民一套衣服也不能做。这就是比例问题。
    在社会主义建设的比例问题中，工业和农业之间，重工业和轻工业之间的比例是需要首先解决的重大问题。
    工业和农业是互相依赖的，如果没有粮食的增长，没有工业原料的充分供应，要想很快地发展工业是不可能的。我国几年来的工业生产的显著提高，都是和前一年的农业丰收有着密切的联系。但是，反过来，农业要想有大的发展，没有工业的支援也不行，机械化、电气化、化学肥料、农药等等，没有工业是不行的。但是，它们之间的发展又是有矛盾的，别的不用说，人力、物力、财力的投放，就有矛盾。这实质上是个比例问题。广东工业基础薄弱，我们必须利用一切可能来多搞一点工业，应该在尽可能的情况下多投一些人力、物力、财力进去；但是，我们也要看到，农业没有相适应的发展，要想把工业基础一下子就打得很雄厚也是不可能的。具体来说，在农业方面，我们要做到粮食彻底过关，而广东粮食过关，每年没有六百亿斤是不行的；并且要在一般情况下，大体上稳定下来，保证每年确实有这么多粮食，而不是一年松，一年紧。要做到这点，我们就要在最近两三年时间内，大力抓一抓农业。仍要坚决贯彻执行农业为主的方针。只要农业（主要是粮食）真正彻底过了关，我们就可以放手来发展工业了。这从表面上看，好像对工业方面的发展不够积极，但从实际情况来看，却是很积极的，因为很难设想，一个省份在没有彻底解决好粮食问题以前，竟然能够在基础薄弱的情况下，优先发展好工业（尤其是重工业）。
    优先发展重工业，保证生产资料的优先增长，不断地扩大再生产，这是一条客观经济法则。因为没有重工业的发展，农业电气化、机械化便不能实现，轻工业也会因为不能增加机器而得不到充分的发展。尤其是我国，过去重工业基础非常薄弱，所以就更需要优先发展重工业。但是这与发展轻工业也要有一个比例。因为它们相互之间既是相互促进又是相互制约的，任何一个部类生产过多过快了，就会挤掉了别的一个部类，而势必引起失调，本来是想迅速前进的，但结果反而会慢，甚至倒退。
    从去年一年的实践来看，根据广东目前情况，重工业和基本建设搞得过多是有问题的。广东工业没有基础，万事仰求于人的情况应当改变，但不可能要求一下子改变。具体说来，就是重工业和基本建设必须加快发展，但其发展速度，必须在确保人民的生活资料能得到基本满足的前提下进行。不积极进行工业建设，就不可能有国家的工业化，这无疑是错误的；但完全不照顾群众的基本的生活需要，就不会有群众的积极性，这也是错误的。
    自然，按比例的发展并不等于每个部门都是半斤八两的发展。这不可能。各个部门之间保持固定的比例和静止的平衡是做不到的。尤其是在像我们这样经济落后的国家来建设社会主义，不平衡的现象经常出现就更没有什么奇怪。从平衡到不平衡，又从不平衡到平衡，是经济发展中的一个正常形式，这是对立而又统一的，没有平衡与不平衡的辩证关系，工作就无法进展。但这并不是说发展的越不平衡越好。如果某一部门发展到超出客观比例所允许的最大限度，那达到的将不是新的平衡，而是失调，那我们当然不需要，而且要竭力避免。也就是从这一意义出发，我们要经常调整两者之间的关系。但这种关系只有在发展中才能调整。有些人过于害怕不平衡，害怕紧张，认为可以毫不紧张地就达到新的平衡，那是不切实际的想法，是不懂得事物发展法则的人的想法，如果按照他们的想法做去，社会主义建设事业就将停步不前或进行得很慢了。
    五、调查研究与一切经过试验
    调查研究与一切经过试验是我们工作方法中的重要方法，对于唯物论者来说，这是工作中带根本性的方法。前面讲到的怎样认识客观存在问题，怎样发挥主观能动性的问题，怎样正确的解决社会主义建设的速度与比例等问题，要想做好，离开了调查研究与一切经过试验是办不到的。没有调查研究就没有发言权这句话，就是批评专凭主观办事的人的。但是，我们还应该看到，调查研究总是或多或少地带有主见的，因此，它的结果不一定是完全符合客观实际情况的，如果根据调查研究来的情况，一下子就对全盘工作做出决定，往往也会有不少地方不切实际。这一方面是由于我们在做调查研究时有主见，不完全符合客观实际；另方面也由于各个地区有各个地区的不同条件不同情况，根据一个点的调查研究的结果做出的决定对全部地区都符合实际情况是不可能的。当然，从总的方面，从基本的方面来说，很多问题是有普遍性的，这一点不能否定，不然就什么决定也做不出来了。但各个地区在贯彻执行这一决定时，一定要结合当地情况。要结合的好就要一切经过试验。所以，从这一意义出发，调查研究与一切经过试验，是相辅相成的，它们都是工作中所必经的阶段和重要过程，是我们工作中的根本方法，也是主观认识客观的根本方法。
    调查研究要真正发现问题。调查时要不要有主见呢？要有。因为我们不能像红头苍蝇一样，乱碰乱撞地去找问题。但是，当发现问题与自己主见不符时，又要善于放弃主见。只有这样，才是唯物主义者的态度。调查研究时容易出现两种情况，一种情况就是当他发现了实际情况和他开始时所抱的主见不同时，他还不肯放弃自己的成见，而是尽量找对于自己的主见有利的材料（不管这些材料是带普遍性的还是个别的），以证明自己的主见是“正确”的。应该说，这已经从最根本的一点上失掉调查研究的意义了。还有一种情况，是当他发现了问题以后“浅尝辄止”，满足于表面上所发现的一鳞半爪，不再深入一步钻进去，因而不能发现问题的本质所在，从而更好地做出决定，推动我们的工作。这和我们的工作作风不够艰苦深入是有关系的。
    一切经过试验，由试验到推广，由点到面的工作方法，毛主席是经常强调的。事实证明了，凡是实行这个方法的地方，它的工作一定是又积极又稳妥的；相反地，凡是忘记了这个方法的地方，它的工作不是“过头”就是“不及”。今年早造，我们在推广直播或种粳稻时，没有经过试验，就一下子铺开，以致受到一些损失，就是没有实行一切经过试验的原故。
    从工作来讲，我们为什么这样强调“一切经过试验”呢？因为对一件新的事物（比如一个新的品种，一件新的措施），我们很难一下子把它认识得很清楚，甚至有时认识错了。在工作中，这种情况本来是难免的。但如果我们采取了一切经过试验，试验成功才加以推广的办法，不但可以避免像前面所指出的农业技术改革上所受到的损失，同时，由于我们有试验，不断总结成功经验，就可以不断地提高。不断地试验，不断地总结，不断地推广，这样一个过程，也正是不断地通过实践，不断地使对自然规律、人与自然的关系、以及人与人的关系的认识深刻化的过程。而这正是毛主席在“实践论”中所告诉我们的马克思列宁主义的思想方法和工作方法。
    从农业上来讲，强调一切经过试验，就能贯彻实现因地制宜、因时制宜、因人制宜的要求，譬如深翻和密植等先进措施，一般来讲，大家都不会有什么不同意见，但具体到那一种土壤应该深翻到什么程度，密植到什么程度，只能有一个大致的要求，而不可能定出一个共同的标准。我们要取得丰收，既要采取这些先进措施，但又要谨慎从事，因此，就要强调经过试验，成功了再加以推广。又譬如，粳稻应不应种，应该怎样种，什么时候种，在粤北和海南就有所不同，更不用说东北和广东了。因此，怎样从具体情况出发，采取一切经过试验的方法来指导农业生产，这是一个既积极又稳妥的办法，也是领导作风谨慎的一种具体表现。
    我们这样强调“一切经过试验”，“因地制宜”，“从具体条件出发”，是不是对于别的地区的先进经验就不重视了呢？当然不是。这个道理在前面已经讲过了。别的地区有了先进经验，帮助我们掌握客观事物的法则，节省我们的精力，我们当然不能不重视不学习。但是，在学习时也一定要先经过试验，根据试验的结果，再决定怎样推广，断不能盲目接受，贸然推广。我们有一部分直播稻、粳稻受到损失，就是吃了这个亏。
    推广经验时，当然是推广先进的经验。但在我们总结经验时，却需要既重视好的典型（这是主要的），又要重视坏的典型。因为事物总是有两个方面的，单纯总结先进经验，只看到先进的一面，我们的认识就会不完全。过去我们对落后的方面注意不够，今后应多加注意。
