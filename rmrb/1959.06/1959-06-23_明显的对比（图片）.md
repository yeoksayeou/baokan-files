	Obvious Contrast
	Look, why is there such a stark difference in the growth of these two bundles of wheat in the picture on the right? Because the degree of implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" is different, the effects are completely different.
	That bundle with the tall stalks and large ears is grown by the Xiacun Production Team of the Huangzang Commune in Xiaoxian County, Anhui. That wheat field was sown with forty-eight catties of seeds, and because it was plowed to a depth of one foot and five inches, had sufficient fertilizer, and the field management was well done, the average yield was more than two thousand catties per mu. That bundle with the short stalks and small ears is grown by the Baitu Brigade of the same commune. That wheat field was sown with fifty catties of seeds per mu, but because it was plowed to a depth of six inches, no fertilizer was applied, and there was no management in the later stages of wheat growth, the result was only one hundred and seventy-nine catties and thirteen taels per mu.

    明显的对比
    请看，右图这两束麦子为什么长得如此悬殊？因为对“八字宪法”贯彻的程度不同，效果截然两样。
    那一束秆高穗大的，是安徽萧县皇藏公社夏村生产队种的。那块麦田下种四十八斤，因为耕深一尺五寸，肥料充足，田间管理作得好，每亩平均收了二千多斤。那束秆矮穗小的，是该社白土大队种的。那块麦田每亩下种五十斤，由于耕深六寸，没有上肥料，小麦生长后期也没有管理，结果每亩只收到一百七十九斤十三两。
