Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 27th. Anhui Province recently held another provincial materials exchange meeting. The total value of organized goods reached 79.89 million yuan, of which daily necessities, small local and special products and internally adjusted industrial products traded within the province accounted for more than 25%; goods that can be supplied upward and exchanged with other provinces accounted for more than 74%.

Anhui Province uses two methods for adjusting materials. For daily necessities and local and special products with a wide variety of items, contracts and agreements are signed between production and sales areas from the county to the province. The total value of goods traded by the province's commercial system in this form reached 15.42 million yuan. Most of these commodities, such as brooms, mops, pot lids, washboards, slippers, etc., are things that people need frequently in their lives. After adjustment, they can better serve the people's economic life. For commodities directly included in the national plan, the internal adjustment method of commercial departments is adopted according to the supply and sales situation in various places. The adjustment work is first carried out within the scope of the county and special zone, and finally within the scope of the entire province. The total value of commodities adjusted in this way reached 5.32 million yuan. Most of the adjusted industrial products are high-end goods, such as radios, Parker pens, cameras, wool fabrics, woolen cloth, etc. These commodities do not sell well in rural areas. Now, appropriately adjusting them to supply cities will increase the supply of high-end goods in cities.

In the materials adjustment work, commercial departments in various parts of Anhui fully promoted the overall situation ideology and actively adjusted the local potential materials as much as possible to supply brother regions. Hefei and Huainan cities needed mosquito net cloth, and Wuhu Special Zone actively transferred 300,000 meters to supply Huainan and Hefei cities. Bengbu Special Zone needed strips of baskets as packaging supplies, and Liu'an Special Zone took the initiative to give the source of goods to Bengbu Special Zone. In order to support industrial cities, Fuyang Special Zone repeatedly explored sources of goods, and the strips of baskets provided increased from more than 200,000 to more than 300,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th. Fuzhou Cultural Goods Wholesale Station cooperates with transportation departments to vigorously carry out direct transportation of goods. Now, 63.11% of the goods transferred by this station have adopted direct transportation, saving the country a large amount of transportation costs.

This station listed direct transportation work as one of the central contents of increasing production and practicing economy this year, and took many measures to reduce commodity backflow and detour transportation. They changed transportation routes and formulated direct transportation flow charts, and then cooperated with transportation departments to organize transportation. Now, they have changed a total of forty-four commodity transportation routes outside the province. For example, the goods originally transported from Fuzhou to Yongchun and Datian had to pass through Quanzhou, which was a long route and high freight. Now, the goods transported to Yongchun are transported directly by car via Xianyou, and the goods transported to Datian are transferred by train via Yong'an. These two changes alone can save more than 2,900 yuan in freight throughout the year. Secondly, they changed transportation tools, changing road transportation to railway transportation and land transportation to water transportation according to the different characteristics of the goods and transportation conditions. For example, after the goods transported from Wenzhou to Fuzhou were changed from land transportation to sea transportation, each ton of goods could save more than 84 yuan in transportation miscellaneous fees. At the same time, for those who can directly transfer at stations and docks, they are quickly transferred without staying in the warehouse, saving a lot of handling labor and handling fees.

    根据市场需要　调剂城乡物资
    安徽召开物资交流会议组织城乡货源
    福州文化用品批发站同交通部门协作开展直线运输
    新华社合肥27日电　安徽省最近又召开全省物资调剂会议。组织的货源总值达到七千九百八十九万元，其中省内各地交流的日用杂品、小宗土特产品等商品和内部调剂的工业品占25％以上；可以提供上调和向省外交流的物资占74％以上。
    安徽省调剂物资用两种方式进行。对于品种繁多的日用杂品和土特产品，采取从县到省，由产区、销区签订合同和协议的形式成交。全省商业系统用这种形式成交的商品总值达一千五百四十二万元。这类商品，如扫帚、拖把、锅盖、洗衣板、拖鞋等等，大多数是人民生活中经常需要的东西，经过调剂以后，就能更好地为人民经济生活服务。对于直接纳入国家计划的商品，根据各地的供销情况，采取商业部门内部调剂的办法。调剂工作首先在县、专区范围内进行，最后在全省范围内进行。这样调剂的商品总值达五百三十二万元。调剂的工业品绝大部分是高档商品，如收音机、派克钢笔、照相机、毛料、呢绒等等。这些商品在农村不行销，现在适当地调剂到城市来供应，就增加了城市高档商品的供应量。
    安徽各地商业部门在物资调剂工作中，充分发扬了全局思想，积极把当地的潜在物资尽可能调剂出来，供应兄弟地区。合肥、淮南两市需要蚊帐布，芜湖专区就积极调剂出三十万公尺，供给淮南、合肥两市。蚌埠专区需要条筐做包装用品，六安专区就主动地把货源让给蚌埠专区。阜阳专区为了支援工业城市，一再挖掘货源，提供的条筐由原来的二十多万个增加到三十多万个。
    新华社福州27日电　福州文化用品批发站与交通部门协作，大力开展商品直线运输。由这个站调拨的商品，现在有63.11％采取了直线调运，为国家节约了大批运输费用。
    这个站今年把直线运输工作列为增产节约的中心内容之一，采取了许多措施来减少商品倒流和迂回运输现象。他们改变运输路线，制订直线运输流向图，然后与交通部门协作组织运输。现在，他们已在省外共改变了商品运输路线四十四条。如原来从福州运至永春、大田的商品都要经过泉州，路线长，运费高；现在运到永春的商品，改用汽车经仙游直接运去，运大田的商品则用火车经永安转运。仅这两项改变，全年就可以节约运费二千九百多元。其次，他们改变运输工具，根据商品的不同特性和交通条件，改公路运输为铁路运输，改陆运为水运。如从温州运到福州的商品，由陆运改为海运后，每吨货可以节约运杂费八十四元多。同时，对于能就车站、码头直接转运的就迅速转运，不再到仓库停留，节省了大量搬运劳力和搬运费。
