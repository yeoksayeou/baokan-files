    Firmly Establish the Idea of Economic Accounting

    Economic accounting is an important method of socialist enterprise management and an important means of implementing the conservation system. With its help, it can serve as a mirror, correctly reflecting whether production and business management are reasonable and economical. From accounting, analysis, and comparison, we can find ways to achieve the greatest economic results with the least labor consumption.
  At present, it is even more necessary to pay attention to strengthening economic accounting work. This is because, after last year's Great Leap Forward, the production of many enterprises has greatly developed, the variety of products has expanded, equipment has been added, and the number of employees has increased, requiring enterprise management to quickly keep up with the rapidly developing production situation. At the same time, in last year's Great Leap Forward, the masses were mobilized to reform the rules and regulations that restricted the development of productive forces. This was very necessary, but there were also situations where some necessary systems should have been established but were not, or were not strictly implemented. Some enterprise leaders had a weak understanding of economic accounting, and did not fully implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, in some links, there appeared management chaos, lax systems, and wasteful phenomena of extravagance. This also requires us to continuously improve the level of business management on the basis of continuing to carry out mass movements on a large scale.
    If economic accounting is not valued, wasteful phenomena will grow. Some enterprises have uneven workloads in the use of labor, the proportion of non-production personnel is too large, they do not know how much the output of a laborer is, and they do not pay attention to rationally adjusting labor organization to improve labor efficiency. Some enterprises lack reasonable consumption quotas for many materials, using large materials for small purposes, using whole materials for parts, using high-quality materials for inferior purposes, and even stockpiling useful materials, making it impossible for the state to uniformly allocate raw materials and ensure the needs of all aspects.
    True, we won the great achievement of the Great Leap Forward in production last year, but our country has not yet fundamentally changed its poor and blank state. If we do not pay attention to careful calculation and think that a little waste does not matter, then precisely because the family is large and the business is large, a little bit of waste adds up to a large amount. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We must make all cadres and all the people constantly think that our country is a large socialist country, but also a poor country with a backward economy. This is a great contradiction. It will take decades of hard struggle to make our country rich and strong, including implementing the policy of practicing strict economy and opposing waste in building the country through diligence and thrift." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") Every one of our comrades should think about whether we have often thought about such a great contradiction? Have we put such a thrifty policy into practice? In order to continue the leap forward, we must strengthen economic accounting. Only by strengthening economic accounting can we promote the comprehensive leap forward of production with more, faster, better, and more economical results. Relaxing economic accounting, not paying attention to plugging the loopholes of waste, and not improving the enterprise management system will inevitably cause great losses in production and reduce the speed of production development.

### 牢固地树立经济核算思想

    牢固地树立经济核算思想
    经济核算是社会主义企业经营管理的一个重要方法，是贯彻节约制度的重要手段。借助它可以作为一面镜子，能够正确地反映出生产和经营管理是否合理，是否经济，从核算、分析、比较中，找出用最小的劳动消耗，取得最大的经济效果的途径。
  当前，更需要注意加强经济核算工作。这是由于经过去年的大跃进，许多企业的生产大大发展了，产品品种扩大，设备增添，职工人数增加，要求企业经营管理工作迅速跟上生产飞跃发展的形势。同时，在去年大跃进中，通过发动群众，对那些束缚生产力发展的规章制度作了改革，这是十分必要的，但也出现了有些必要的制度应该立而未立或未能严格执行的情况，有些企业的领导人员经济核算思想淡薄，对多快好省的方针执行不全面，因而在某些环节上，出现了管理混乱、制度松弛、大手大脚的浪费现象，也要求在继续大搞群众运动的基础上，把经营管理水平不断提高。
    不重视经济核算，浪费现象便会滋长起来。有些企业在劳动力使用上忙闲不均，非生产人员比例过大，不知道一个劳动力的生产量是多少，不注意合理调整劳动组织，来提高劳动效率；有些企业有许多材料缺乏合理的消耗定额，大材小用，整材零用，优材劣用，甚至积压了有用的物资，使国家无法统一调拨原材料，保证各方面的需要。
    不错，我们去年赢得了生产大跃进的伟大成就，但是我们的国家还没有基本改变一穷二白的面貌，如果我们不注意精打细算，以为浪费一点无所谓，那末恰恰由于家大业大，一点一滴的浪费，加起来就是个大数目。毛泽东同志说：“要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）我们每个同志都应该想一想：对待这样一个很大的矛盾，是不是经常想到了？对待这样一个勤俭方针，是不是身体力行了？为了继续跃进，就必须加强经济核算，只有加强了经济核算，才能促使生产多快好省地全面跃进。放松经济核算，不注意堵塞浪费的漏洞，不健全企业管理制度，就必然会造成生产上很大的损失，降低生产发展的速度。
