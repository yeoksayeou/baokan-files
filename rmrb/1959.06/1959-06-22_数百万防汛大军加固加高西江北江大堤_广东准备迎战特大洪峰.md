Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st. The people of Guangdong Province, preparing for a decisive battle against the extraordinary flood peaks of the West River and North River, are continuing to reinforce and heighten the large and small dikes, determined to subdue the extraordinary floods.

The dikes of the West and North Rivers in Guangdong will face their most severe test in two or three days. The person in charge of the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters said that due to changes in rainfall and wind conditions in the upper and middle reaches of the West and North Rivers on the 19th and 20th, the date of the extraordinary flood peaks appearing downstream of the West and North Rivers has been postponed to the 23rd and 24th, later than expected.

According to the rainfall forecast by the Meteorological Observatory, after the West and North Rivers converge on the 23rd and 24th, the flow rate at the confluence will reach 53,000 cubic meters per second. At the same time, the 23rd is one of the two largest high tides of the year. With such a large flood from the upper reaches and the downstream being blocked by the extraordinary high tide, the situation is extremely dangerous, and the safety of the Pearl River Delta and Guangzhou City will be seriously threatened.

The North River dike, which plays a decisive role in protecting Guangzhou and the eastern part of the Pearl River Delta, has been renovated for years after liberation, and its strength is sufficient to cope with extraordinary floods. However, it was renovated on the basis of the old dike, and the foundation is not good. At present, a thorough search has been carried out on the 120-li dike, and the seven dangerous sections and more than 200 places with water seepage that were discovered have been urgently and properly handled. Telephones, electric lights, and radios have been set up in important sections. The entire dike section is stationed with a well-organized flood control army, and is filled with sacks, lime, and sand to deal with unexpected events.

The dozens of large and small dikes protecting the Pearl River Delta and the farmland and rural areas on both sides of the West River and North River were all decided on the evening of the 18th to be raised by 0.5 meters to 1.5 meters. According to calculations by the provincial and special district flood control headquarters, after the dikes are raised by this amount, they will be able to cope with this extraordinary flood peak. As of tonight, the work of raising the 1,200-li dikes in the Pearl River Delta has been completed in full accordance with the requirements. The project of raising and reinforcing the dikes on both sides of the West River is being rushed day and night. There are millions of People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, workers, farmers, and cadres who are rushing to repair and guard the dikes in the West River, North River, and Pearl River Delta. The newly formed flood control teams in the rear, and the trucks, trains, and ships carrying flood control materials, are still continuously heading towards the dikes. Thousands of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Navy, Army, and Air Force stationed in Guangzhou, and some cadres of the provincial, municipal, and central government agencies in Guangzhou, have also been organized to be ready to be dispatched at any time and fight the floods.

The Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee held another emergency meeting this afternoon, deciding that all members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, and all responsible cadres of the provincial, municipal, party, government, military, and civilian departments, will go to the dikes tomorrow, to the forefront, to live and fight with the flood control army, to lead the masses, and to defeat the flood peak. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, Chen Yu, Secretary of the Secretariat and Governor of Guangdong Province, Qu Mengjue and Wen Minsheng, Secretaries of the Secretariat, Yin Linping, Alternate Secretary, Wang De, First Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee, Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou, and Lieutenant General Liu Xingyuan, Deputy Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Army Guangzhou Garrison, will all go to the dikes where the flood control struggle is tight tomorrow. The Provincial Party Committee also decided that during the flood control struggle in the West River and North River, all work should serve flood control! All work should give way to flood control! Do everything possible to meet all the needs of the flood control struggle, giving people when people are needed at the dikes, and giving materials when materials are needed!

The person in charge of the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters said that according to the current flood control preparations and the rainfall and water conditions, if there are no more heavy rains or rainstorms in the next two or three days, and with the extraordinary efforts of the flood control army, it is possible to defeat the extraordinary flood peaks of the West River and North River.

    数百万防汛大军加固加高西江北江大堤
    广东准备迎战特大洪峰
    新华社广州21日电　准备同西江、北江特大洪峰决战的广东省人民，正在继续加固加高大小堤围。决心制服特大洪水。
    广东的西、北江大堤在两三天后，将经受一次最严重的考验。省防汛指挥部负责人说，由于19日、20日西江、北江上、中游地区雨情、风情的变化，西江、北江下游出现的特大洪峰日期，较预计向后推迟到23日至24日。
    另据气象台预报的降雨量计算，23到24日，西、北两江洪水汇合后，在汇合点将达到五万三千个流量；同时23日又为一年最大的两次海潮中的一次，上游这么大的洪水下袭，下游又被特大的海潮抵住，情况极为危险，珠江三角洲和广州市的安全将受到严重的威胁。
    对保卫广州和珠江三角洲东部地区具有决定作用的北江大堤，经过解放后连年整修，其强度足以应付特大洪水；但它是在旧的基础上整修的，基础不好。目前已对一百二十华里大堤进行了严密的搜索，发现的七处险段和两百多处渗水的地方，都进行了紧急的妥善处理。并在重要工段架设了电话、电灯、报话机。整个堤段驻上了组织严密的防汛大军，和摆满了应付意外事件的麻袋、石灰、砂子。
    保护珠江三角洲和西江、北江两岸农田和农村安全的数十个大小堤围，在18日晚上就已决定一律加高半公尺到一点五公尺。据省、专区防汛指挥部计算，堤围加高这么多以后，便能应付此次特大洪峰。到今日晚上止，珠江三角洲一千二百里堤围的加高工作，已按要求全部完成。西江两岸的堤围加高加固工程正在星夜抢修中。在西江、北江、珠江三角洲抢修、守卫堤围的人民解放军官兵、职工、农民、干部共有数百万人。在后方新组成的防汛队伍，装载防汛器材的汽车、火车、船只，仍在源源不断地向堤围开去。驻在广州的人民解放军海、陆、空军数千官兵和在广州的省、市、中央机关部分干部也组织起来，准备随时听候调遣，和洪水搏斗。
    中共广东省委常委会今日下午又举行紧急会议，决定省委所有常委、省、市党、政、军、民所有负责干部，明日一律到堤围上去，到最前方去，和防汛大军在一起生活、战斗，率领群众，战胜洪峰。中共广东省委第一书记陶铸，书记处书记、广东省省长陈郁，书记处书记区梦觉、文敏生，候补书记尹林平，中共广州市委第一书记王德，广州市长朱光，人民解放军广州驻军副政委刘兴元中将都将于明日分别到防洪斗争吃紧的堤围上去。省委还决定，西江、北江防洪斗争期间一切工作为防洪服务！一切工作为防洪让路！做到堤围要人给人，要器材给器材，竭尽力量满足防洪斗争的一切需要。
    省防汛指挥部负责人说，按照现在的抗洪准备工作和雨情、水情，以后两三天如再无大雨、暴雨，经过防汛大军的非常努力，西江、北江特大洪峰是有可能战胜的。
