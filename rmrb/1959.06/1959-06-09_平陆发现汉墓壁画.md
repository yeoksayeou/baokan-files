    Pinglu Discovers Han Tomb Murals
    Recently, villagers in Zaoyuan Village, Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, discovered an ancient Han Dynasty tomb. After an inspection by the Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee, it was determined to be a tomb from the late Western Han Dynasty, dating back approximately 1,900 years.
    The tomb chamber is a single room constructed with interlocking bricks, with an ear chamber on the south side. The tomb door was sealed with wooden planks, and the tomb passage was filled with rammed earth. The walls inside the tomb were decorated with colorful paintings, including scenes of the sky (such as floating clouds, birds, the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, and the Black Tortoise); and underground landscapes with figures (such as working farmers plowing fields, driving carts, and feeding cattle), realistically reflecting the appearance of agricultural production during the Han Dynasty, providing valuable data for our research on ancient agricultural production and culture and art.
    Among the unearthed artifacts, there are fifteen burial objects, including an iron sword, a green glazed pottery pot (with figures and tiger images), a pottery granary, a gray pottery jar, and "Da Quan Wu Shi" coins. In addition, a sheep skeleton was also discovered.

    平陆发现汉墓壁画
    最近，山西省平陆县枣园村群众，发现了汉代古墓一座。经省文物管理委员会勘察，认定是西汉末期的墓葬，距今约有一千九百多年。
    这个墓室是子母砖砌单室，南侧有耳室。墓门用木板封堵，墓道是夯土填平。墓内墙壁粉饰彩画，有天空景象（如浮云、鸟、青龙、白虎、玄武等）；有地下山水人物（如劳动农民种田、赶车、喂牛等形象），真实地反映了汉代农业生产的面貌，对我们研究古代农业生产和文化艺术，提供了宝贵的资料。
    在出土器物中，有铁质宝剑、绿釉陶壶（上有人物及老虎形象）、陶仓、灰陶罐、大泉五十钱等十五件随葬品。另外，还发现羊骨架。
