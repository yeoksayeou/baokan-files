Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 26th: A million steelworkers in Italy began a forty-eight-hour general strike from zero hours today.

This is the third major strike by Italian steelworkers in the past three months. The striking workers are demanding higher wages and shorter working hours. Members of unions with various political leanings are participating in the strike.

The struggle of the Italian working people for their rights is developing daily under their united strength. The strike of 100,000 bank clerks has been going on for twelve days. The sailors' strike, which began on the 9th, is still ongoing. Currently, more than 60,000 sailors are participating in the strike. The Italian authorities attempted to requisition civilian ships under the pretext of maintaining maritime traffic between mainland Italy and Sicily in order to undermine the strike. However, this attempt has failed due to the resolute resistance of the striking workers. On the 23rd, workers in the tobacco and salt industries also held a twenty-four-hour strike. The strike by marble processing workers, which began on the 24th, is still continuing.

    银行职员、海员和大理石工人坚持罢工
    新华社26日讯　罗马消息：意大利一百万钢铁工人从今天零时起开始四十八小时的总罢工。
    这是意大利钢铁工人最近三个月来的第三次大罢工，罢工工人要求提高工资和缩短工作时间。参加罢工的包括有各种政治倾向的工会的会员。
    意大利劳动人民争取权利的斗争在他们团结一致下正日益发展。十万名银行职员的罢工已经进行了十二天。从9日开始的海员大罢工仍在坚持中。目前，参加罢工的海员已经超过六万人。意大利当局曾企图以保持意大利本土同西西里岛之间的海上交通为借口，来征用民船以破坏罢工，但是，在罢工工人的坚决反击下，这种企图已经破产。在23日，烟草业和盐业部门的工作人员也举行了二十四小时的罢工。从24日开始的大理石加工工人的罢工还在继续进行。
