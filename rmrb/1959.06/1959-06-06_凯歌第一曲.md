The tapping of the iron furnace opened, and the fiery, red-hot molten iron flowed out, sparks flying and golden stars dancing. Immediately, applause rang out, and along with the applause, someone shouted loudly: "Iron has been tapped from Blast Furnace No. 3! Iron has been tapped from Blast Furnace No. 3!"

Surrounding the No. 3 Blast Furnace with its freely flowing iron, everyone looked radiant and full of energy. My heart was filled with excitement, and I couldn't help but blurt out: "The three major projects of Shijingshan Iron & Steel Works have been built so quickly!"

People still clearly remember the scene when the design personnel started drawing the design blueprints in August of the year before last, and also remember the joyful scene when Comrade Zhu De cut the ribbon for the groundbreaking ceremony on this barren land on May 28 last year, and also remember the scene a year ago when workers started working next to two dilapidated concrete mixers; but in the blink of an eye, people's hopes have been transformed into a blast furnace more than twenty stories high, as well as many large and small factory buildings and chimneys. It really is like "a spring breeze blowing overnight, and a garden full of flowers blooming." Especially when you think that molten iron and molten steel pour out here like red waterfalls, and countless shining steel products are continuously transported from here to factories all over the country, and the factories use these steel products to quickly make machine tools, trains, automobiles, ships, tractors, textile machines... Thinking of this, who can not be excited? Who can not cheer from the bottom of their hearts!

Just as I was thinking this, I suddenly saw the company's Party Committee Secretary and Manager. They were talking to the workers, what were they talking about? Look at how they are smiling from ear to ear!

More than a year ago, their mood was not entirely like this! I heard them say that at that time, their mood was both happy and worried. Happy that the factory was going to be expanded; worried that the relationship between the three parties, A, B, and C, involved in the expansion was complex, and things would be difficult to handle.

Just then, news suddenly came: "Investment package." The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry approved the transfer of all the money to the company, asking the company to find its own way to build it. Immediately following this came another message: The three parties, A, B, and C, participating in the construction were merged into one entity, under the unified leadership of the company's Party Committee.

The Party Committee called on everyone: "Under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party, contract at all levels, and everyone is the master of their own affairs."

What good news! Everyone immediately beamed with joy.

And the happiest were probably the comrades in charge of finance.

Before that, people were constantly looking for them, asking for money and materials, and refusing to leave if they didn't get it. The comrades in the finance section were very good at calculating, and they refused to give it. Who doesn't want to build the factory bigger? Better? But there was only so much money! As a result, everyone had a lot of opinions about the finance section, and the finance section? They felt very wronged.

After the "investment package," the finance section's "business" suddenly cooled down.

The comrades in the finance section went around the factory and saw that everywhere they went, people were holding meetings to speak out and debate, and the walls were covered with rationalization proposals. This person said that implementing my suggestion can save so much money; that person said that realizing my suggestion can save so much material.

Then, good news came one after another. Today, the staff of the Transportation Department proposed that they didn't need to recruit new workers, they could draw out two hundred people to organize a railway team to build forty-five kilometers of railway. Tomorrow, the staff of the Mechanical Power Workshop said that they had decided not to build a new factory building. They had their eye on a dilapidated house, and after tidying it up, it could be used as the factory building for the repair factory. A few days later, the staff of the machine repair department said that they could take on the thousands of tons of non-standard equipment that couldn't be processed by outside factories. Not long after, the construction personnel said that they had dug up a large amount of sand and gravel from the ground, and a mixing plant could be built on the spot, saving 1.5 million yuan. The comrades in the finance section were so happy that they told everyone: "Now it's so easy to do capital construction, all parties come to support, and there's no more worry or complaint."

The workers were even more enthusiastic. They said: "The more you contract, the more advanced you become, the more you contract, the more responsible you become, and the more you contract, the brighter your heart becomes." Comrade Dang Jinming, a worker, explained it well: "The country trusts us, gives us the money to manage, and asks us to be the masters of our own affairs, so how can we not be responsible and active? Otherwise, what kind of masters are we! We put forward such a slogan: 'Equipment and main factory buildings should be good, and living welfare facilities should be simple.' If there are not enough dormitories and offices, everyone will take the initiative to repair and patch up the hundreds of unused dilapidated dining halls, air-raid shelters, and sheds in the factory, and build some simple sheds, which are also very comfortable to live in! As the saying goes: 'If there is something in the pot, you don't have to worry about not having something in the bowl?' When our factory is built, and there is a lot of iron and a lot of steel in the factory, will we still be afraid of not having tall buildings to live in then?"

Everyone was so enthusiastic, but strangely, the plan was not completed in June and July. Why?

At this time, someone suggested that the construction front was stretched too long. Of the twenty-one projects, sixteen were under construction. There were only so many construction machines, people, and materials. If you wanted it, he also wanted it, and it couldn't be divided up. If we continued to open up on all fronts like this and garrison our forces, fighting a "war of attrition," we would never be able to complete the plan. It would be best to make a ruthless decision to temporarily put aside the other construction units and concentrate superior forces to attack the No. 3 Blast Furnace, No. 3 Coke Oven, and Sintering Plant. This way, we can fight a quick battle and make a quick decision! But some people couldn't figure it out. They were reluctant to put down the projects that had already started. After arguing back and forth, the Party Committee finally spoke: "According to the opinions of the majority and past experience, we have decided to concentrate our forces and fight a war of annihilation!"

The forces were concentrated, and a look at the construction site revealed a magnificent scene! The workers were working in an orderly manner on the three key construction sites. The workers said: "Fighting on the construction site is like fighting on the battlefield. As long as the main enemy is eliminated, the entire war situation can be won." The workers understood the importance of attacking the three major projects. Their enthusiasm rose, and each and every one of them was as brave as a divine dragon stirring the sea, like a fierce tiger leaving the mountain.

Like the painters, they hung a rope in the high altitude and sat on it to paint. From a distance, it looked like a circus troupe swinging on a trapeze in the high altitude, which was really breathtaking, but they themselves didn't care at all. They wrote poems to describe their lives and moods, and the poems wrote: "Feet on the clouds and head on the sky, waist tied with treasure belt hanging in the clouds, building thousands of tall buildings, we are the living immortals."

And the most enthusiastic were probably the crane operators, who hoisted the gantry frame, which was six or seven stories high and weighed thirty-four tons, into the high altitude of fifty or sixty meters on windy nights. They only spent more than thirty hours hoisting the main hoist, which weighed more than seventy tons. The same thing, in Anshan Iron and Steel in the past, they hoisted it for more than ten days, and there were twice as many people as there are now. Workers wrote poems to praise them: "What is it difficult to pull up Mount Tai, to fill the East Sea in the blink of an eye; holding the pole and shaking the shoulders towering into the clouds, thousands of tons of blast furnace shaking in the air."

The first furnace of iron was finished, and I walked down from the blast furnace. On the road, I met several comrades from the Design Department and Equipment Department. They walked and enthusiastically discussed the moving scene of the iron tapping just now. How could they not talk about it? There was a lot of their hard work in it!

I visited the Design Department. I know that the organizational form of this design by Shijingshan Iron & Steel is different from that of other units. They organized a joint design team, put together the designers from the three design institutes to draw the sketches, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee of Shijingshan Iron & Steel. They only used three months to draw the expanded preliminary design. As soon as the drawings came out, they immediately started buying materials and equipment. In the past, several design institutes would send official documents back and forth to fight lawsuits, and it would take another six months or a year to make the expanded preliminary design.

As soon as the design personnel started drawing, the comrades in the Equipment Department got busy. They thought, without equipment, the furnace cannot be installed, how can the project be completed! We must get the equipment as soon as possible. How to get it? The equipment is made by more than 300 factories across the country, so we had to go separately to "urge" it.

I have heard many stories of them urging goods.

Such a thing once happened at the Harbin Electric Motor Factory:

The workers in the factory liked the three "guests" from Shijingshan Iron & Steel very much. They worked in the workshop all day long, handing tools to the old workers for a while, and carrying things with the workers for a while. When the workers were sick, they went to deliver food and water. When they got familiar, everyone called them Lao Ji, Lao Huo, and Lao Wang. One day, the workers asked these three "guests": "What did you do in Shijingshan Iron & Steel before?" The one named Lao Wang said: "Lao Ji is the Party Committee Secretary of a factory in our Shijingshan Iron & Steel, and Lao Huo is the Director of the Equipment Department." The workers were all stunned when they heard this. They said: "After all, they are people from the capital, they are different from others, we also have to speed up our work for the brothers in the capital."

Such stories are not one or two. The company's Party Committee Secretary, Manager, and Trade Union Chairman have gone out twelve times to urge goods. Resident staff lived in other people's factories all year round. They took photos of the company's on-site construction situation to introduce to others the urgent need for equipment at Shijingshan Iron & Steel. They also took letters written by advanced producers of Shijingshan Iron & Steel introducing the progress of the project and sent them to the advanced producers of that factory. They not only acted as propagandists, but also spent more time working as workers, material staff, planners, dispatchers, and technicians in other people's factories. When people in other factories couldn't make the forms and reports, they helped them with crash efforts. When people were too busy to inspect the products, they went to help. When people ran out of materials, they went all over the world to find them. For example, the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory produced a large number of high-voltage oil switches, but because there were no wooden boxes, the goods could not be sent out. What to do? The cadres of Shijingshan Iron & Steel ran to the Municipal Party Committee to find a way. The Municipal Party Committee introduced them to a timber processing factory. The processing factory had plenty of timber, but there was not enough electricity and it could not be processed. The cadres of Shijingshan Iron & Steel went to the Municipal Party Committee again to find a way to ask the Electricity Bureau to supply extra electricity to the processing factory. They ran around and finally solved the problem.

They enthusiastically solved problems for others, so others were also very willing to rush to make equipment for them.

It was dark, but the fire from the blast furnace baked the sky of Shijingshan Iron & Steel into a brocade glow. Today, there was no drumming, gongs, or firecrackers in the company, but the whole factory was boiling with an indescribable joy. My heart could not calm down, and I thought of what Comrade Diao Xiang, "the local expert," said. Since he was just sensible, he had known the No. 1 Blast Furnace of Shijingshan Iron & Steel. At that time, every year on April 15, he followed his mother to the temple fair on Shijingshan, and every year he saw the No. 1 Blast Furnace standing lonely in the weeds. However, he never saw smoke coming out of that furnace. Later, the Japanese came, and he was forced to enter Shijingshan Iron & Steel. At that time, he was only thirteen years old. The Japanese were "actively" building several small blast furnaces and a No. 2 Blast Furnace. The number of workers "increased" to 30,000 to 40,000, but the workers were all pale and thin, and they couldn't even wear clothes in the cold winter, so they had to cut a piece of cement paper bag to make a piece of clothing to wear. During the Kuomintang rule, the factory only opened a No. 1 Blast Furnace and a small blast furnace. The number of workers was cut to only 4,000 to 5,000 people. Diao Xiang was laid off and went home to farm for two years. After liberation, the factory got better year by year. Not only did it clean up the damaged furnaces, but it also built a new steelmaking furnace last year. Now the company can both make iron and make steel.

Diao Xiang stopped here and his eyes sparkled. He couldn't restrain the joy in his heart. Then he said that some time ago, he worked in the general drawing group of the Design Department for a while. There were many comrades there who were drawing the long-term planning map of Shijingshan Iron & Steel. The three major projects that have been completed now are just the first song of triumph. In a few years, Shijingshan Iron & Steel will not only have many large blast furnaces, but also its own steelmaking plant, steel rolling plant...

Thinking of this, a strong fighting emotion suddenly surged in my heart. By then, how many new factories will be built one after another in our capital, and by then, how many new workers will grow up! Let us continue to work hard, let us move forward to that youthful and beautiful day! (Attached photo)

    凯歌第一曲
    本报记者  傅冬
    出铁口打开了，通红炽热的铁水奔流出来，火花四溅，金星飞舞。顿时，掌声齐鸣，和着掌声，有人在高声喊叫：“三高炉出铁了！三高炉出铁了！”
    人们围着铁水畅流的三高炉，一个个容光焕发，神采奕奕。我心里一阵激动，不自禁地脱口而出：“石钢的三大工程建的真快呀！”
    人们还清清楚楚地记得前年8月设计人员才开始画设计图纸的情景，也记得去年5月28日朱德同志在这块荒地上为开工典礼剪彩的欢腾景象，还记得一年前工人在两个破旧的混凝土搅拌机旁开始工作的场面；但是，曾几何时，转眼功夫，人们的希望，变成了一座二十多层楼高的高炉，好些个大大小小的厂房和烟囱。真是“一夜春风吹，满园百花开”。特别是当你想到，铁水和钢水像红色的瀑布一样在这儿倾泻，无数亮光闪闪的钢铁从这儿源源不断地运到各地工厂，而工厂用这些钢铁，没多久就制成了机床、火车、汽车、轮船、拖拉机、纺织机……想到这，谁能不激动？谁能不从心底里喝采！
           ×××
    我正这样想着，忽然看见了公司的党委书记和经理。他们正在和工人谈话，他们谈些什么？你看他们笑得嘴都合不拢来！
    一年多以前，他们的心情可不完全是现在这样呵！听他们谈过，那时候，他们的心情是又喜又担心。喜的是：工厂要扩建了；担心的是：扩建中甲、乙、丙三方关系复杂，事情不好办。
    正在这时候，忽然间传来个消息：“投资包干”。冶金部批准把钱全部交给公司，叫公司自己想法盖。紧接着又传来了个消息：参加建设的甲、乙、丙三方合成一个整体，由公司党委统一领导。
    党委号召大家：“在党的集中统一领导下，层层包干，大家当家”。
    多么好的消息呵！大伙顿时喜笑颜开。
    而最高兴的，恐怕要数管财务的同志了。
    在那以前，成天有人找他们，要钱要材料，不答应不走。财务科的同志很会打算盘，他们算来算去，不肯给。谁不想把工厂盖得大一点？好一点？可是钱就那么多呀！结果大伙对财务科一大堆意见，财务科呢？觉得自己很委屈。
      “投资包干”以后，财务科的“生意”突然冷下来了。
    财务科的同志到厂里各处绕了一圈，只见到处都在开会鸣放辩论，满墙贴的都是合理化建议。这个人说，实行了我的建议可以省多少多少钱；那个人说，实现了我的建议，可以省多少多少材料。
    接着，好消息一个接一个传来。今天，运输部的职工提出，不要招新工人，他们可以抽出二百人，组织个铁道队，修四十五公里的铁路。明天，机械动力车间的职工说，他们决定不盖新厂房了，他们看中了一座破房子，收拾收拾就可做检修工厂的厂房。过几天，机修部门的职工说，外厂加工不过来的几千吨非标准设备，他们可以担当起来。又过了没多久，施工人员说，他们从地下挖出了大批的沙石，这样就地就可搞一个搅拌厂，可省一百五十万元。财务科的同志高兴得到处对人说：“如今搞基建，事情真好办，各方来支援，再不愁和怨。”
    工人们的情绪更高，他们说：“越包越先进，越包越负责，越包心越亮”。工人党金明同志解释得好：“国家信任我们，把钱交给我们管，叫我们当家作主，这样，我们怎么能不负责不积极呢？不然，我们算什么主人翁！我们提出这样一个口号：‘设备、主要厂房要好，生活福利设施因陋就简。’宿舍、办公室不够，大伙就动手把厂子里原有的几百间不用的破烂食堂、防空洞、车棚修了修补了补，又盖了些工棚，住起来也很惬意！俗话说：‘锅里有，还怕碗里没有？’等我们的工厂盖好了，工厂里有了很多的铁，很多的钢，那时候还怕没有高楼住吗？”
               ×××
    大伙的劲头那么高，可是奇怪，6、7月却没有完成计划。这是为什么？
    这时有人提出，施工的战线拉得太长了，二十一项工程中，有十六项在施工。施工机械、人、材料就那么多，你想要，他也想要，分也分不过来。要是老这样全面开花，分兵把守，打成“消耗战”决不能完成计划。最好是下个狠心，把其他建设单位暂时放一放，集中优势力量，突击三高炉、三焦炉和烧结厂。这样可以速战速决！可是有些人却想不通，他们舍不得把已经开工的工程放下，这样辩来辩去，最后党委说话了：“根据大多数人的意见和过去的经验，决定集中兵力，打歼灭战！”
    兵力集中起来了，到工地上看一看，真是气象万千！工人在三个重点工程工地上，有秩序地工作着。工人说：“在工地上作战，也像在战场上一样，只要把主要敌人消灭了，整个战局就能得胜。”工人们懂得了突击三大工程的重要性，他们的劲儿上来了，一个个勇猛得像神龙搅海，猛虎离山似的。
    像油漆工，他们在高空挂根绳子，坐在上面刷油，远远看去，活像马戏团在高空里荡秋千一样，看着真叫人心惊胆跳，可是他们自己却满不在乎。他们写诗描写自己的生活和心情，诗中写道：“脚踏云彩头顶天，腰系宝带挂云间，盖起高楼千万座，我们就是活神仙。”
    还有那些电焊工，他们背着电线，在十几二十层楼高的高炉上爬上爬下。他们二十五个技工干着以前一百多个技工的活。他们高兴地说：“焊罩下面蓝光闪，我用电焊缝青天，百尺高空日夜焊，蓝海之中显英雄。”
    但干劲最最高的恐怕要数那起重工了，他们在刮大风的夜里，把六、七层楼高、三十四吨重的龙门框吊到五、六十公尺高的高空。他们只用了三十多个钟头，就把七十多吨重的主卷扬机吊上去。同样的东西，过去在鞍钢，他们吊了十多天，人还比现在多一倍。工人写诗歌颂他们：“拔起泰山有何难，填平东海眨眼间；抱杆晃膀矗云霄，千吨高炉空中摇。”
           ×××
    头一炉铁出完了，我从高炉走下来。在路上，我遇到设计处和设备处的几位同志。他们一面走一面热烈地谈论刚才出铁的动人景象。他们怎么能不谈论呢？这里面有他们很多心血呵！
    我访问过设计处。知道石钢这一次设计的组织形式和其他单位的不一样。他们组织了一个联合设计小组，把三个设计院的设计人员合在一起画草图，由石钢党委统一领导。他们只用了三个月的功夫，就把扩大初步设计画出来了。图一出来，马上就动手买材料和设备。要是在过去，几个设计院公文来公文去打官司，光扩大初步设计就得再拖半年一年才能作出来。
  设计人员一开始画图，设备处的同志就忙上了。他们想，没设备，炉子装不上，工程怎么能完呀！一定得把设备早早拿到手。怎么拿呢？设备是全国三百多个工厂做的，只好分头去“催”了。
    我听过不少他们催货的故事。
    在哈尔滨电机厂曾经发生过这样一件事：
    工厂的工人很喜欢从石钢来的三位“客人”，他们成天在车间干活，一会儿给老工人递工具，一会儿和工人一块抬东西，工人病了，他们去送饭送水。处熟了，大家老冀、老霍、老王的喊起来。有一天，工人问这三位“客人”：“你们原先在石钢作什么工作？”那位叫老王的说：“老冀是我们石钢一个厂里的党委书记，老霍是设备处的处长。”工人听了都楞了。他们说：“到底是从首都来的人，就是与众不同，咱们也得给首都的兄弟加紧干活。”
    这样的故事，不是一个、两个。公司的党委书记、经理、工会主席先后十二次出去去催货。驻在员成年累月住在人家工厂里。他们拿着公司现场施工情况的照片，给人家介绍石钢迫切需要设备的情况。又拿着石钢先进生产者写的介绍工程进展情况的信件，送给那边工厂的先进生产者。他们不但当宣传员，更多的时间是在人家工厂当工人，当材料员、计划员、调度员和技术员。人家厂里的表报作不出来了，他们帮人家突击。人家检查产品忙不过来的时候，他们去帮忙。人家没材料了，他们满世界去找。例如沈阳高压开关厂造出一大批高压油开关，因为没有木箱，货发不出去。怎么办呢？石钢的干部跑去找市委想办法。市委给介绍到木材加工厂，加工厂木材倒有的是，可是电力不足，没法加工。石钢的干部又去找市委，设法请电业局额外给加工厂供电。他们东跑西跑，终于把问题解决了。
    他们热心给人家解决问题，所以人家也非常乐意给他们赶制设备。
        ×××
    天黑了，但高炉里喷出的火光，把石钢的天空烘成锦霞一片。今天公司里没有敲锣打鼓、放鞭炮，可是全厂却沸腾着一种难以描述的欢乐情绪。我的心平静不下来，我想起“地里通”刁祥同志的话。刁祥从刚懂事的时候起，他就认识了石钢的一高炉。那时，他年年4月15日随着母亲到石景山上赶庙会，年年都看见那孤零零地立在荒草里的一高炉。可是，他始终没见那炉子里冒过烟。后来日本人来了，他被迫进了石钢，那时他才十三岁，日本人倒是“积极”修了好几个小高炉和一个二高炉。工人“增”到三、四万人，可是工人一个个面黄饥瘦，大冬天连衣服都穿不上，只好用块洋灰纸袋剪件衣服披着。国民党统治的时候，厂里只开一高炉和一个小高炉。工人裁得只剩四、五千人了。刁祥被裁，回家种了两年地。解放后，厂里一年比一年好，不但收拾好被毁坏的炉子，去年还新修了炼钢炉。现在公司又可以炼铁，又可以炼钢。
    刁祥说到这里停了停，他的眼睛闪闪发光，他抑制不住心头的喜悦，接着他又说，前些时，他在设计处总图组工作了一个时间，那里有很多同志正在画石钢远景规划图。现在完工的三大工程不过是凯歌第一曲，几年以后，石钢不但有很多大高炉，还有自己的炼钢厂、轧钢厂……
    想到这，我心里顿时涌起一种强烈的战斗情感。到那时，我们首都将有多少新的工厂相随着盖起来，到那时，将有多少新工人成长起来！让我们再接再厉，让我们向那青春美好的日子前进吧！（附图片）
