Lovely Hometown
	Da Kan (Kazak)
	Who doesn't love the boundless grasslands, having grown up there? Last August, after graduating from the Central Institute for Nationalities, I joined the social and historical survey of minority nationalities and returned to my hometown – the grasslands of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, from which I had been separated for many years.
	I am familiar with the grasslands, the green pastures where cattle and sheep can never graze to the end, the black soil that yields oil with every step. I am familiar with the people on the grasslands and their past impoverished lives. Before liberation, they moved around the grasslands all year round, not knowing how to farm, and possessing very few livestock. Young people only knew how to herd cattle and sheep; women only knew how to fetch water and make tea. Many herdsmen had little to eat and wear, relying on one or two dairy cows to squeeze milk in the summer, eating sour milk curds, and slaughtering calves to eat in the winter; for clothing, they wore old sheepskin coats in the winter, and in the summer, they wore bare sheepskin jackets as single garments; it was even rarer for people to go to school and study.
	This time when I returned to my hometown, I almost couldn't believe my eyes. The once desolate wilderness of Karamay has become a famous petroleum industrial base in our country, with countless derricks lining both sides of the asphalt roads. Cars drive for a long time before leaving the oil area with its array of derricks. People in the interior may rarely know about the small towns of Tacheng and Tuoli, but electric lights already flicker in these small towns like shining lead stones on the grasslands, and water mills have been transformed into flour mills. On the streets of Tacheng, I saw many exquisite leather boots, leather shoes, and leather clothing, and could hardly believe that these were new products from the local leather factory. The changes in the countryside seem even greater. Herdsmen are organized everywhere, and Kazakh women in bright red and green dresses laugh and chat while shelling corn in the threshing grounds. Children wearing red scarves go to school.
	Due to work, I have been back on the grasslands for several months and haven't found time to go home. My mother traveled a long distance to Tacheng to see me, bringing hundreds of joyful news from the grasslands. She said that there is no one on the grasslands without livestock anymore. She joked that Zhuma Bai, the poorest person in the village in the past, has become a "Bai" (rich person). Zhuma Bai was my neighbor, so poor in the old society that he didn't even have a felt tent, and his family huddled in a dilapidated cave. "What about Boboer?" Boboer (garbage, named because when she was born, the family was dilapidated, and her parents were moved by the scene) is Zhuma Bai's eldest daughter, a thin and dirty shepherdess. My mother smiled and said, "She is already a beautiful middle school student." My mother also told me that the family eats in the commune canteen every day, my father goes up the mountain to make iron, and has even become a technician, receiving praise twice. My eleven-year-old younger brother, Daliyahan, has been in school for three years. I miss my father and brother, and I also think of myself. When I was eleven years old, I didn't know a single letter and only helped my father herd livestock.
	Returning to my hometown, many friends from my childhood are gone. Upon inquiring, some have gone to the interior to learn technology, and some have gone to Karamay to become workers. One day, I was walking on the streets of Tacheng when a person riding a tall, strong blue horse galloped towards me. The person on the horse was short, with a dark red face and yellow eyes. Ah, isn't this Mohammadalakhmu, the son of Bolik Buli, who grew up with me? Isn't this Mohammadalakhmu, who had to come home to herd sheep after not even finishing three months of school because his family was poor! Now, he is wearing corduroy riding pants, leather boots, and looks radiant. As soon as he saw me, he jumped off his horse. In our conversation, I learned that he is a brigade leader in the commune and is about to rush up the mountain to make iron. When we parted in a hurry, he told me that if I needed anything, just call him, as telephones are now available in every district and commune on the grasslands. Not long ago, I received a letter from my father from the iron-making site, saying, "In the past, I thought stones were useless, but now they are flowing with molten iron. With iron and steel, we can have any machines, sickles, and horseshoes we want." His letter is so exciting. I find that my hometown is now truly lovely.

    可爱的故乡
    达坎（哈萨克族）
    草原长大的孩子，谁不喜爱那漫无边际的草原。去年8月，我从中央民族学院毕业，参加了少数民族社会历史调查工作，回到了离别多年的故乡——伊犁哈萨克族自治州的草原。
    我熟悉草原，那牛羊永远也吃不到尽头的绿草地，那一脚能踩出油来的黑壤土。我熟悉草原上的人们和他们过去的贫困生活。解放以前，他们一年四季在草原上搬来搬去，不会种地，牲畜也很少。青年人只知道赶赶牛羊；妇女只知道提水烧茶。很多牧民少吃没穿，夏天只靠着一两头奶牛挤奶，吃酸奶疙瘩，冬天就把牛犊宰杀吃掉；穿的，冬天是老羊皮袄，夏天又把没皮的光板皮衣当单衣穿；上学念书的人更是罕见。
    这次我回到了家乡，几乎不相信自己的眼睛，早先一片旷野的克拉玛依成了我国著名的石油工业基地，沥青马路两旁是数不清的井架，汽车走了半天，才走出井架成阵的油区。内地人也许很少知道塔城、托里这些很小的城镇，可是电灯已经像草原上发光的铅石在这些小城镇闪灼，水磨变成了面粉厂。我在塔城街上看到了许多精美的皮靴、皮鞋和皮衣，几乎不相信这就是当地皮革厂的新产品。乡村的变化看起来更大，牧民到处都组织起来了，穿着红红绿绿裙衫的哈萨克妇女嘻嘻哈哈地在打禾场上剥玉米，儿童带上了红领巾到学校去上学。
    因为工作原因，我回到草原上几个月了，也没有抽身回家一趟，母亲远道跑到塔城来看我，带来了草原上成百喜讯，草原上已经找不到没有牲畜的人了。她开玩笑说：村里早先最穷的主玛拜已经成了“巴依”（有钱人）。主玛拜是我的邻居，旧社会穷得没有一片毡子，一家人挤在一个破窑洞里。“波波儿呢？”波波儿（垃圾，这是因为她生下来时，家里破破烂烂，父母触景生情给她取的名字）是主玛拜的大女儿，一个又瘦又脏的牧羊女。母亲微笑着说：“人家已经是一个漂亮的中学生了。”母亲还告诉我，家里人天天在公社食堂吃饭，父亲上山去炼铁，还当了技术员，受过两次表扬。十一岁的弟弟达里亚汉已经上学念了三年书。我想念着父亲、弟弟，也想起我自己，十一岁的时候，我还一个字母也不识，只会帮着父亲赶牲畜哩。
    回到故乡，许多少年时代的朋友都不见了，一打听，有的到内地学技术，有的到克拉玛依当工人了。有一天，我在塔城街上行走，一个人骑着一匹高头大青马急驰过来，马上的人矮矮的身材，黑红脸，黄眼睛。啊，这不是当年和我一起长大的伯力克堡里的儿子莫合买提拉合木吗？这不是因为家穷，连三个月的学也没有上完就回家给人放羊的莫合买提拉合木吗！现在，他穿着条绒马裤，皮靴子，神彩焕发。一见我，他就跳下马来。谈话中我才知道他是公社的一个大队长，正要赶着上山去炼铁。匆匆分手时，他又叮咛我，有事只管打电话，如今草原上区区社社都通电话了。不久以前，我接到父亲从炼铁工地上寄来的一封信，信上说：“过去我以为没有啥用处的石头，现在却流出了铁水。有了钢铁，什么机器啊，镰刀啊，马掌啊，要什么就会有什么。”他的信多么令人兴奋。我发现故乡现在是真正地可爱了。
