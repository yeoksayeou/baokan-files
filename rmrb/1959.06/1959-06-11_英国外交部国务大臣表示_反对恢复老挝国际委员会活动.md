Xinhua News Agency, London, June 10th: British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Profumo, reiterated in the House of Commons on the 8th that Britain opposes the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Laos.

Profumo admitted that over the past four months, the British government had received several letters from the Soviet government accusing the Lao government of violating the Geneva Accords and requesting the resumption of activities of the International Commission for Laos. However, he defended the Lao government's actions in undermining the Geneva Accords.

Profumo also stated that the British government had sent a note to the Soviet Union on April 7 regarding the situation in Laos, saying that in this note, Britain rejected the Soviet proposal to resume the activities of the International Commission for Laos.

Profumo also revealed that attached to this note was a draft letter from the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference to the Chinese Foreign Minister. In this "draft," the British government also asserted that "the Royal Lao Government has not abandoned the Geneva Accords," and defended the United States, saying: "The accusations that the US government has sent a large number of military personnel and weapons into Laos are inaccurate and without basis." Yet everyone knows that even the United States itself has openly admitted that its "aid" to Laos is "most successful."

    英国外交部国务大臣表示
    反对恢复老挝国际委员会活动
    新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部国务大臣普罗富莫8日在下院回答问题的时候再次表示，英国反对恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。
    普罗富莫承认，在过去四个月内英国曾经收到苏联政府的指责老挝政府违反日内瓦协议和要求恢复老挝国际委员会活动的若干信件，但是他却为老挝政府破坏日内瓦协议的行为辩护。
    普罗富莫还说，英国政府曾在4月7日就老挝局势给苏联一份照会，他说英国在这份照会中拒绝了苏联要求恢复老挝国际委员会活动的建议。
    普罗富莫还透露，随着这份照会还附了一封以日内瓦会议共同主席名义给中国外交部长的函件的草稿。英国政府在这份“草稿”中也认为“老挝王国政府并未废弃日内瓦协议”，并且为美国辩护说：“所谓美国政府已经向老挝派进大批军事人员和运进大量武器的指责是不准确的，没有根据的”。可是谁都知道，连美国自己都公开承认它对老挝的“援助”是“最成功”的。
