    When we think about complex and difficult-to-solve problems, we often use "pondering" to describe our thought activities. On closer inspection, using "pondering" to express the state of our thought activities during deep thinking is accurate and can summarize some important laws in the process of thought activity.
    Since it involves both "left thinking" and "right thinking," it indicates that the brain is in motion, even intense motion, thinking about one side of the matter and then the other, using thought to study the situation, analyze the problem, and try to find the laws of movement from complex and diverse phenomena, and come up with solutions. When we encounter difficult problems, if we do not seriously use our brains and honestly "ponder," it is impossible to correctly understand and solve the problem. When encountering difficult problems, we must not only be willing to think, but also need to boldly and audaciously imagine in order to effectively understand and solve the problem. Intellectual sluggards generally do not like to "ponder." If thinking is not bold and vigorous, thought activity is not easy to unfold, and therefore, in the face of difficult problems, thought often appears weak and powerless.
      "Pondering" indicates that during deep thinking, thought movement does not proceed in a single direction, but moves in one direction first, and under certain circumstances, develops to a certain degree, and then turns back to proceed in the opposite direction. Thus, from "left thinking" to "right thinking," from "right thinking" to "left thinking," a repeated process of thought movement is formed. This process of thought movement may be repeated once, or it may be repeated many times. Due to the research and analysis of objective things, each repetition adds some new components to ideological understanding, and the understanding of the problem may be deepened. When "pondering," the more daring and audacious the imagination, the stronger the thought movement, and the greater the amplitude of the thought movement. Often, thinking moves from one extreme of the matter to the other, and the ability of thought activity is relatively strong. Therefore, the progress of studying the situation and analyzing the problem may be relatively fast. The more thoughtful and far-sighted a person is, the more frequent, meticulous, and profound the repeated thought movements when studying problems. They always "think thrice before acting," and after thorough investigation and research, after careful consideration, they make up their minds only after seeing accurately.
    When "pondering," thought movement is not a simple straight line forward, but a tortuous process. If there is only "left thinking" without "right thinking," or only "right thinking" without "left thinking," and one always considers the problem in one direction, thought tends to go straight and cannot move forward in a tortuous manner. Anyone whose thought goes straight cannot avoid making mistakes. One situation is that the initial ideological understanding is wrong, and thought proceeds in one direction, always unable to turn around, and continues to make mistakes again and again after hitting a wall. These stubborn or old-fashioned people who persist in errors are always obstinate and unwilling to "ponder." Another situation is that the initial ideological understanding was originally correct. Because of being intoxicated with a single insight, thought always develops in one direction and is unwilling to consider different aspects. Once it develops too far, it is possible to exaggerate the correct things to an inappropriate degree, and thus truth will become absurd. Or, the objective situation has undergone fundamental changes, but it still adheres to outdated correct views, and thus the subjective understanding is divorced from the objective reality, and one cannot avoid making subjectivist errors. Another situation is that one is simple-minded and self-righteous, and just after a brief encounter with the matter, before having time to see it clearly, in order to be the first, without waiting to "ponder," one hastily draws a conclusion or recklessly acts rashly.
    When we "ponder," if thought only moves back and forth on a line, forming a simple reciprocating reduction process, and thought circles around on the old path, there cannot be much progress in the understanding of objective things. In this case, it often manifests as bewilderment, hesitation, and indecision. Therefore, when studying problems, we must investigate and study objective things, analyze and synthesize them, and constantly summarize experiences and lessons. In this way, thought can constantly add new content, and the understanding of the problem can be gradually deepened. In this case, thought movement will not simply reciprocate on a line like a pendulum, but will advance in a "zigzag" manner or ascend in a spiral, and the understanding of things will gradually progress from superficial to deep, and dig into the essence from the phenomena.
    When we "ponder," thought movement is a contradictory and unified development process. For the problem under study, thinking of "yes," and also thinking of "no"; thinking of "good," and also thinking of "bad"; thinking of "advantageous," and also thinking of "disadvantageous"; .... The opposites of thought repel each other, promote each other, complement each other, and permeate each other. The development process of contradictions in thought is also the deepening process of understanding objective things. After investigation and research, analysis and synthesis, and then making an affirmative conclusion, the contradiction in thought is resolved. Some people think that it is ridiculous for ideological understanding to be contradictory before and after in the process of studying problems. In fact, before the problem is studied clearly and a definite conclusion is drawn, it is completely in line with the laws of thought movement to have self-contradictory aspects in ideological understanding.
    "Pondering" does not mean constantly wavering from left to right in looking at problems. Those who behave left or right, swaying from side to side in their work, are precisely those who are unwilling to "ponder" and whose thoughts go straight. Because when they study problems, they do not clarify the subjective and objective situation, do not go through in-depth research and analysis, and do not go through repeated deep thinking, and then hastily draw conclusions. The problem is not studied deeply and thoroughly, the basis is not sufficient, the grasp is not great, and the confidence is not strong. Once they encounter some obstacles and difficulties, they shake, manifesting as wavering from left to right. If, after truly repeated research and consideration, one makes up one's mind after the understanding is clear and the thought is mature, it is not easy to waver from left to right.
    When studying problems, discussing and consulting with others is extremely helpful for the development of ideological understanding. In consultation and discussion, some of other people's opinions are consistent with one's own opinions, and some are exactly the opposite of one's own opinions. Both types of opinions are helpful for studying problems, especially the opposite opinions. Opinions that are consistent with one's own can supplement and strengthen one's own ideological understanding, while the opposite opinions have a greater effect. With opposite opinions, one can establish an opposite in discussing the problem and carry out ideological struggle. In the ideological struggle, one's own thoughts are promoted and stimulated, one's own views are exercised and tested, forcing oneself to "ponder," strengthening one's own thought activities, conducting in-depth investigation and research, and preventing one's own thoughts from only considering the problem from one aspect, making the mistake of thought going straight. In the process of ideological struggle, one can extract rational elements from opposing thoughts to supplement the deficiencies in one's own ideological understanding. If one's original ideological understanding is incorrect, one should abandon one's original ideas and turn around to further consider the problem from the opposite side. Therefore, when studying problems, it is a welcome good thing to have opposites in ideological understanding, and even if the other party's views are completely wrong, it is still very beneficial for studying problems.

    左思右想
    程今吾
    当我们思考比较复杂而不易解决的问题的时候，常常用“左思右想”来说明自己的思想活动。仔细想来，用“左思右想”来表述我们在深思时的思想活动状况是确切的，很能概括思想活动过程中的一些重要的规律。
    既然“左思”和“右想”，说明脑子正在运动着，甚至是在剧烈地运动着，从事情这一面想到事情的那一面，运用思想去研究情况，分析问题，试图从复杂纷纭的现象中找出事物运动的规律，想出解决问题的办法。当我们遇到困难问题的时候，如果不认真地开动脑筋，实事求是地“左思右想”一番，要想正确地认识问题、解决问题是不可能的。遇到困难问题，不但要肯想，而且需要勇敢地、大胆地设想，才能有效地认识问题和解决问题。思想上的懒汉，总是不大喜欢“左思右想”的。想问题时不大胆泼辣，思想活动就不易展开，因而在困难问题的面前，思想往往显得软弱无力。
      “左思右想”说明我们在深思的时候，思想运动不是向着单一的方向进行，而是先向着一个方向运动，在一定的情况下，发展到一定的程度，然后又折转回来向着相反的方向进行。于是从“左思”到“右想”，从
  “右想”到“左思”，形成思想运动的反复过程。这种思想运动的过程，可能是反复一次，也可能是多次反复。由于对客观事物进行研究分析，因而，每一次反复，思想认识上就会增加若干新的成分，对问题的认识也就可能加深一层。在“左思右想”的时候，愈是敢于大胆设想，思想运动愈强烈，思想运动的幅度也愈大，往往从事情的一个极端想到另一个极端，思想活动的能力就比较强，因而，研究情况、分析问题的进度也可能比较快。愈是有深谋远虑的人，研究问题时，思想运动的反复次数也愈多、愈细致、愈深沉，遇事总是“三思而行”，经过周密的调查研究，经过深思熟虑，看准确了，才拿定主意。
    在“左思右想”的时候，思想运动不是简单的直线前进，而是曲折前进的过程。如果只有“左思”而没有“右想”，或者只有“右想”而没有“左思”，老是朝着一个方面考虑问题，思想往往走直线，而不可能曲折前进。凡是思想走直线的人，没有不犯错误的。一种情况是，一开始思想认识就是错误的，思想沿着一个方向进行，老是扭不转来，碰了壁还不转弯，一错再错地错下去。这种坚持错误的
  “死脑筋”或“老顽固”，总是固执己见，不大肯
  “左思右想”。另一种情况是，开始时思想认识原是正确的。由于陶醉于一得之见，思想老是朝着一个方面发展，不肯向不同的方面考虑，一旦发展过了头，就有可能把正确的东西夸大到不适当的程度，于是真理也会变成荒谬。或者，客观情况已经起了根本的变化，它还在坚持过了时的正确观点，于是主观认识和客观实际脱了节，就不免要犯主观主义的错误。还有一种情况是，头脑简单而又自以为是，事情刚打个照面，还没有来得及看清楚，为了抢先，等不到“左思右想”，就轻率地下了结论，或鲁莽地蛮干起来。
    当我们“左思右想”的时候，如果思想只是在一条线上来回运动，构成简单的往返还原过程，思想在老路上打圈子，对客观事物的认识，就不可能有多少进展。在这种情况下，往往表现为迷惘、犹豫、徬徨。所以在研究问题的时候，必须对客观事物进行调查研究、分析综合，不断地总结经验教训，这样，思想上才能不断增加新的内容，对问题的认识才能逐步深入，在这种情况下，思想运动就不会像钟摆似的在一条线上简单的来回反复，而是“之”字形的蜿蜒前进，或螺旋形的盘旋上升，对事物的认识，逐步由浅入深，由现象向本质掘进。
    当我们“左思右想”的时候，思想运动是矛盾统一的发展过程。对于所研究的问题，想到“是”，又想到“非”；想到“好”，又想到“坏”；想到“有利”，又想到“不利”；……。思想的对立面，互相排斥，互相推动，互相补充，互相渗透。思想上的矛盾发展过程，也就是对客观事物认识的深入过程。经过调查研究，分析综合，然后作出肯定的结论，思想上的矛盾也就得到解决。有些人以为在研究问题的过程中，思想认识前后矛盾是可笑的。实际上，在问题研究清楚，得出肯定的结论以前，思想认识上有自相矛盾的地方，是完全合乎思想运动规律的。
    “左思右想”并不等于看问题经常左右摇摆。在工作中表现或左或右、东倒西歪的人，正是那些不肯“左思右想”、思想走直线的人。因为他们在研究问题的时候，没有把主客观情况弄清楚，没有经过深入的研究分析，没有经过反复地深思熟虑，就轻下结论。问题研究得不深不透，根据不充分，把握不大，信心也不强，一旦遇到些阻碍和困难，就动摇起来，表现为左右摇摆。如果真正经过反复研究考虑，等到认识清楚，思想成熟之后再拿定主意，反而不容易左右摇摆。
    在研究问题的时候，多和别人商量、讨论，对于思想认识的开展帮助极大。在商量和讨论当中，别人的意见有的和自己的意见一致，有的和自己的意见恰恰相反。这两类意见，对于研究问题都有帮助，特别是相反的意见。和自己相一致的意见，可以使自己的思想认识得到补充和加强，而相反的意见的作用更大。有了相反的意见，才能够在讨论问题中树立起对立面，开展思想斗争。在思想斗争中，使自己的思想得到推动和激发，使自己的见解得到锻炼和考验，迫使自己不得不“左思右想”，加强自己的思想活动，深入调查研究，并且可以防止自己的思想只从一个方面考虑问题，犯思想走直线的错误。在思想斗争的过程中，可以从反对思想中摄取合理的成分来补充自己思想认识的不足，如果自己原来的思想认识是不正确的，就应当放弃自己的原来的想法，折转过来从相反方面进一步地考虑问题。所以在研究问题的时候，思想认识上有对立面存在，是值得欢迎的好事，即使对方的观点十分错误，对于研究问题也是非常有益的。
