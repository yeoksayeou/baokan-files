    The Late Daughter
    Xue Ye
    One Saturday night, a torrential downpour lashed against the steps in front of the train station waiting room entrance.

    The last passenger entered the station! Only a couple remained at the entrance – a military officer and his wife. They gazed anxiously ahead, as if waiting for someone. The officer took a deep drag on his cigarette, checked his watch, and said,
    “The train leaves in ten minutes. She probably isn’t coming!”
    “That child, already in middle school, still so inconsiderate! You must write her a letter and give her a good scolding,” the woman said, frowning.

    Suddenly, a pedicab sped up and stopped in front of them. As the canopy opened, a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl jumped out of the cab and threw herself into the officer's arms: "Papa, Papa!"
    "Ah! You've finally arrived; I thought I wouldn't see you this time," the officer said, stroking his daughter's head. His tightly furrowed brow relaxed.
    "So busy talking, you even forgot to pay the fare. Comrade, how much?" the middle-aged woman said apologetically to the pedicab driver.
    "No! Comrade, I don't want any money. I should be thanking you," the pedicab driver said.
    "Thanking?"
    "Yes! All thanks to your good daughter here," the pedicab driver said gratefully.
    The officer looked at the pedicab driver, baffled, then turned to his daughter and asked, "What's going on?"
    Yes, what exactly happened?

    Over an hour earlier, night had fallen. A little girl skipped along towards the Experimental Middle School.
    “Oh! Wang Lili, I’ve been looking all over for you! I searched the whole school and couldn’t find you. Where have you been playing?” Old Wang, from the reception room, grumbled.
    “Who was playing? I went to help a classmate with his lessons – he’s sick. What do you want, Uncle Wang?”
    “What’s up?” Uncle Wang said to her: “Your father’s here.”
    “Papa?” She clapped her hands with joy and jumped high. “Where is he?”
    “Waiting for you at the station! Your mother came by earlier; she said your father was passing through. He has important business and can’t go home. He has to catch the nine-thirty train, and he wants you to go to the station to see him.”
    “Where’s Mama?”
    “She couldn’t wait for you and left first, telling you to hurry.”
    “I’m going!” She dropped her schoolbag and ran off, her pigtails, like a pellet drum, quickly disappearing into the night.

    She ran and ran, the contents of her pocket jingling. Reaching in, she touched her beloved seashells and colored stones—gifts her father had brought her on his last visit.
    Years ago, when her father returned, he stroked Lili’s head and asked, “Lili, guess what gift I brought you?”
    “A toy pistol,” she replied immediately.
    “A pistol? What do you want a pistol for?” her father asked, smiling.
    “To fight Chiang Kai-shek, to fight imperialism!” Lili replied innocently, her bright eyes wide.
    “Good, we’ll fight the enemy together and defend world peace,” her father said with a smile, pulling out a rubber dove for her. "Little soldier, here's a peace dove for you!" Then he took out a delicate little cloth bag and said, "There's nothing much to play with at the coastal defense front, so I brought you a few—" He poured the bag onto the table. Ah! It was filled with colorful seashells and oddly shaped colored stones. Lili was so happy she didn't sleep a wink all night. She gave some of her beloved treasures to her classmates, put some in the "Children's Palace," and kept a few for herself. From then on, those shells and stones never left her. When she ran, they jingled in her pocket. They were polished until they shone, as if coated with colored glaze….
    “Thump!” A sudden collision interrupted her happy memories—she had bumped into a woman holding an umbrella.
    “I’m sorry, Auntie,” she said apologetically and ran on.
    “Wait, girl! Do you know where the People’s Hospital is?” the young woman stopped her.
    “The hospital?!” Wang Lili, seeing her anxious look, was startled: “Did I hurt you, Auntie?”
    “No. My child is sick and has a high fever. His father hasn’t returned from pulling his cart yet. I came to get a doctor, but I found out the hospital has moved.”
    Lili was relieved that she hadn’t hurt the aunt, but she immediately became worried: “She’s gone to get a doctor; who’s looking after the sick child at home? If I go get the doctor for her, I won’t be able to see my father… Can a Young Pioneer run away when others are in trouble? No, I can’t! Papa will forgive me.” Thinking this, she said:
    “Auntie, you go back and take care of my little brother, I’ll go get the doctor for you.”
    “You? …Wait, girl, it’s raining, take this umbrella.” The young woman was so moved that her voice trembled.
    She took the umbrella and ran off.

    The rain fell harder and harder. Lili and the doctor were walking hurriedly along the street.
    “Little friend, did you forget to ask her for her address?” the tall doctor asked.
    “How awful! I panicked and forgot to ask. People are very sick, what should we do, Uncle Doctor?” Lili said.
    “Let’s go back to where you met her and see if we can find her.”
    When they arrived at the original spot, they saw a pedicab parked there.
    “Comrades, are you here to see a doctor?” the pedicab driver asked.
    “Yes, you? …”
    “I’m the patient’s father. Please get in the cab quickly, Comrades!”
    Wang Lili looked at the clock; it was already 9:10. She said, "Uncle, since you're here, I won't go. My father is waiting for me at the station. He has to catch the 9:30 train."
    “Ah? Nine-thirty!” The pedicab driver looked up. “Why didn’t you say so sooner! Doctor Comrade, go to my house yourself—61 Boai Hutong. I’ll take this comrade to the station.” With that, he lifted Lili onto the cart and pedaled away.
    “Stop, stop, Uncle, seeing a doctor is important, seeing a doctor is important!”
    But her shouts, along with the cart, quickly disappeared into the vast rainy night.

    After learning the reason for Lili's lateness, her father hugged her tightly and said to her mother with a smile, "We wronged her!"

    迟到的女儿
    雪夜
    一个星期六的夜晚，倾盆的大雨直泼在车站候车室门口的台阶上。
    最后一个旅客进站了！入口处只剩下一对夫妇——一个军官和他的爱人。他们用焦急的眼光望着前方，好像在等什么。军官使劲地抽口烟，看看表说：
    “再过十分钟，车就开了，她可能不来了！”
    “这孩子，已经上中学了，还这么不懂事！你得写封信来好好批评她。”女的皱着眉头生气地说。
    突然一辆三轮车飞快驰来，在他们面前停下了。车篷一打开，一个十二、三岁的小姑娘跳下车，一下子就扑到了军官的怀里：“爸爸，爸爸！”
    “啊！你可来了，我还以为这次见不到你了呢。”军官抚摸着女儿的头，他紧锁着的眉头展开了。
    “只顾说话，连车钱也忘记付了。同志，多少钱？”中年妇女抱歉地对三轮车工人说。
    “不！同志，我不要钱。我还得感谢你们呢。”三轮车工人说。
    “感谢？”
    “是呀！多亏你们这好姑娘啊。”三轮车工人非常感激地说。
    军官莫名其妙的看看三轮车工人，又望望女儿，问道：“这是怎么回事？”
    是啊，这究竟是怎么回事呢？
    一个多小时前，夜降临了。一个小姑娘一蹦一跳地朝实验中学走来。
    “哎呀！王丽丽，你叫我好找呀！我跑遍学校都不见你。你到哪儿玩去了？”传达室的老王埋怨她说。
    “谁玩了，我去帮同学补课去了——他病了。您找我有啥事，王伯伯？”
    “啥事？”王伯伯对她说：“你爸爸来了。”
    “爸爸？”她乐得拍着手一跳多高，“他在哪儿？”
    “在车站等你哩！刚才你妈妈来了，她说你爸爸路过这儿。他有要紧事儿，不能回家，九点半还要搭车走，要你到车站去见他。”
    “妈妈呢？”
    “她等不及你，先走了，叫你快去。”
    “我就去！”她放下书包就跑，拨浪鼓似的两个小辫子迅速地消失在夜色中。
    她跑啊，跑，跑得衣袋里哗哗直响，顺手一摸，啊，是她心爱的贝壳和彩石——这是前年爸爸回来时给她带来的礼物。
    前年爸爸回来时，摸着丽丽的头问：“丽丽，你猜我给你捎回什么礼物？”
    “小手枪。”她马上回答说。
    “手枪？你要手枪干啥呀？”爸爸笑着问她。
    “打蒋介石，打帝国主义呀！”丽丽瞪起明亮的大眼天真地回答。
    “好，我们一起打敌人，保卫世界和平。”爸爸笑着，掏出一只橡皮鸽给她，“小战士，送你一只和平鸽吧！”然后他又掏出个精致的小布袋说：“海防前线也没啥好玩的，给你带回几块——”他将布袋往桌上一倒。呵！尽是些五颜六色的贝壳和奇形怪状的彩石。丽丽乐得一夜没合眼。她把那心爱的宝贝送一些给同学，放一些在“少年之家”，自己留了几块。从那以后，那些贝壳、彩石一直没离开过她。跑起来，衣袋里就哗哗直响。它们被磨得亮光亮光的，好像涂了层彩釉……。
    “咚”，突然的一撞，打断了她幸福的回忆——她和一个打伞的女人撞了个满怀。
    “对不起，婶婶。”她道歉后又跑了。
    “等等，姑娘！你知道人民医院在哪儿吗？”那个青年妇女拉住了她。
    “医院？！”王丽丽看她那焦急的样子，吓了一大跳：“我刚才碰伤了你吗，婶婶？”
    “不是。我孩子病了，正发高烧。孩子他爹拉车还没回来。我来请医生，谁知医院又搬了家。”
    丽丽知道不是把婶婶闯伤了，心里轻松了，但马上又着急起来：“她去请医生，谁在家照看小病人呢？要是替她去请医生，那就见不到爸爸了……一个少先队员见了别人有困难能跑开吗？不，不能！爸爸会原谅我的。”想到这里，她说：
    “婶婶，你回去照看小弟弟吧，我去替你请医生。”
    “你？……等等，姑娘，下雨了，给你伞。”青年妇女激动得声音发抖。
    她接着雨伞就跑了。
    雨愈下愈大。丽丽和医生正在街上匆匆忙忙地走着。
    “小朋友，你忘了问她地址吗？”高个子医生问。
    “真该死！我一慌，忘了问。人家病很急啊，咋办呢，医生叔叔？”丽丽说。
    “还到你碰见她的地方看看吧，或许能碰到她。”
    当他们走到原来那个地方时，只见一辆三轮车停在那里。
    “同志，你们是去看病的吗？”拉车工人问。
    “是啊，你？……”
    “我就是病人的爸爸。请快上车吧，同志！”
    王丽丽看看钟已九点十分了，说：“叔叔，既然你来了，我就不去了。我爸爸还在车站等着我。他九点半就要搭车走了。”
    “啊？九点半！”三轮车工人抬了抬头，“你怎不早说呢！医生同志，你自己到我家去吧——博爱胡同六十一号。我把这位同学送到车站去。”说罢一下子把丽丽抱上了车，蹬车就跑。
    “停停，停停，叔叔，看病要紧，看病要紧啊！”
    但是她的喊声同车子一起迅速地消失在茫茫的雨夜中了。
    知道丽丽迟到的原因以后，爸爸紧紧地搂着丽丽，笑着对妈妈说，“我们错怪她了！”
