    Mobilize the Masses to Accumulate More Natural Fertilizer
    (Our newspaper, Hankou, 9th) The Changfeng Production Team of the Pengxing Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, implemented the working method of relying on and mobilizing the masses in the summer fertilizer accumulation campaign, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient fertilizer sources.
    From early April to the end of May, the team accumulated approximately 100,000 dan of various natural fertilizers, an increase of more than two times compared to the same period last year. Currently, 70% of the team's early rice has been top-dressed once or twice, and more than 60% of the base fertilizer for the single-crop late rice has been prepared. Now, they have put forward the slogan "Fight hard for a month and accumulate another 50,000 dan of fertilizer."
    The Changfeng Production Team is located in an area known locally as the "three no's": not close to mountains, not close to lakes, and not close to towns. Therefore, in previous years, little attention was paid to the accumulation of natural fertilizer, and the team mainly relied on purchasing commercial fertilizer. Last year, the team's investment in commercial fertilizer reached more than 40,000 yuan, accounting for about one-quarter of the team's total income. After the implementation of the "three guarantees" this year, each small team requested to accumulate more natural fertilizer and buy less commercial fertilizer to reduce costs. However, the most prominent difficulty in increasing natural fertilizer accumulation was the limited source of fertilizer. In order to solve this problem, the production team decided to strengthen leadership over the fertilizer accumulation work and mobilize everyone to find solutions. Guan Musheng, Deputy Director of the Commune and Party Branch Secretary of the Changfeng Production Team, found a way to use barnyard grass to ferment fertilizer during a discussion with the masses in the Second Small Team, that is, to pull out the barnyard grass from the rice fields and ferment it in the manure pits at the edge of the fields, which both removes the barnyard grass and accumulates fertilizer, killing two birds with one stone. The entire production team pulled out more than 10,000 jin of barnyard grass for fertilizer fermentation within a few days. The Sixth Small Team found seven sources of fertilizer in two days.
    In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses for accumulating fertilizer, the Changfeng Production Team adjusted the labor quota for fertilizer accumulation and increased remuneration; at the same time, it also clearly stipulated reasonable purchase prices for the cooperative to purchase household fertilizer from the members.

    发动群众多积自然肥
    本报汉口9日电湖北孝感县朋兴公社长风生产队，在夏季积肥运动中，贯彻依靠和发动群众的工作方法，克服了肥源不足的困难。
    这个队从4月上旬到5月底共积各种自然肥约十万担，比去年同期增加两倍多。目前，全队70％的早稻已追肥一次或两次，一季晚稻的底肥已准备了60％以上。现在又提出了“奋战一月，再积肥五万担”的口号。
    长风生产队位于被当地群众称为“三不靠”的地区：不靠近山，不靠近湖，不靠近城镇。因此，历年就不大注意积自然肥，主要靠购用商品肥料。去年这个队商品肥料投资达四万多元，占全队总收入的四分之一左右。今年“三包”落实后，各小队都要求多积自然肥，少买商品肥，以降低成本。但要增积自然肥，最突出的困难是肥源不多。为了解决这个问题，生产队决定加强对积肥工作的领导，发动大家想办法。公社副主任兼长风生产队支部书记官木生在第二小队同群众座谈时，找出了除稗草沤肥的办法，即把稻田稗子扯出来沤在田头粪窖里，又除稗，又积肥，一举两得。全生产队在几天内就扯了一万多斤稗草来沤肥料。第六小队，在两天中找出七种肥源。
    为了调动群众积肥的积极性，长风生产队把积肥的劳动定额作了调整，提高了报酬；同时，对收购社员家庭肥料，也明确规定了合理的收购牌价。
