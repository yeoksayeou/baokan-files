Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch: The "Neues Deutschland" recently published an article by Professor Kahn, director of the German Institute for Economic Research, entitled "Achievements in the Economic Competition with West Germany." The article uses concrete figures to make a sharp comparison of the industrial production and foreign trade of the two Germanys in the recent period, powerfully demonstrating that the socialist German Democratic Republic is rapidly catching up with and surpassing monopoly capitalist West Germany economically.

Comparing Industrial Growth Rates

Professor Kahn wrote: Compared with 1957, West Germany's industrial production growth rate decreased from 5.7% to 3.1% in 1958, while the German Democratic Republic's industrial production growth rate increased from 7.4% to 10.9% during the same period. If calculated by the absolute value of the increased output, West Germany's total industrial output value in 1958 only increased by 3.9 billion marks compared to 1957, with an average of only 80 marks per West German resident; while during the same period, the German Democratic Republic's total industrial output value increased by 5.6 billion marks, with each resident averaging 320 marks.

Professor Kahn continued that, contrary to the claims of the West German Minister of Economics, the situation of West German industrial production in the first quarter of 1959 did not improve in the slightest. In this quarter, the growth rate of West German industrial production further decreased to 2.5%. During the same period, the industrial production growth rate of the German Democratic Republic was 9.8%; in the first four months of this year, it even increased to 12.4%.

Comparing Coal Production

Professor Kahn pointed out that West Germany's coal industry is still in a crisis. As early as the end of April, unsold hard coal had already reached 16 million tons. In the first quarter of this year, West Germany's coke production decreased by approximately 11.7% compared to the same period last year, lignite production decreased by 6.3%, and briquette production decreased by 9.3%; while during the same period, the German Democratic Republic's production of coke, lignite, and briquettes increased by 3.6%, 4.4%, and 4% respectively. Over the past year, West German coal mines have not only laid off 30,000 miners, but the remaining miners have been forced to "take days off" 4 million times, resulting in wage losses of over 100 million marks. Currently, the Ruhr Coal Mine Owners Association is closing "unprofitable" mines and dismissing all miners who mine less than 1,000 kilograms of coal per shift.

Comparing Steel and Machine Manufacturing

Professor Kahn then discussed the steel production of the two Germanys, writing that in the first quarter of this year, West Germany's pig iron production decreased by 14.6% compared to the same period last year, crude steel production decreased by 13.7%, and steel production decreased by 17.3%; while during the same period, the German Democratic Republic's pig iron production increased by 11.6%, crude steel production increased by 7.3%, and steel production increased by 6.8%.

Professor Kahn wrote that West Germany's machine manufacturing industry is one of the industrial sectors that only entered the crisis stage at the beginning of this year. Its output in the first quarter of this year decreased by 4% compared to the same period last year, while during the same period, the German Democratic Republic's machine manufacturing industry's output increased by 15.3%. He emphasized that the production figures of the machine manufacturing industry precisely reveal the vastly different development speeds between West Germany's capitalist system and the German Democratic Republic's socialist economy. This is because the production of many other industrial sectors, especially the mechanization and automation of industrial production in the next few years, will primarily depend on the development of machine manufacturing production today.

Professor Kahn continued that even compared to those industrial sectors in West Germany that are currently still in a state of "prosperity," the socialist system shows obvious superiority. For example, although West Germany's chemical industry production increased by 7.5%, it is still lower than the German Democratic Republic's growth rate of 9.3%; West Germany's electrical equipment industry's production growth rate of 10.7% is also lower than the German Democratic Republic's same industrial sector's production growth rate of 16%.

Comparing Consumer Goods Production

Professor Kahn said that the situation in consumer goods production is even more obvious. For example, in the first quarter of this year, West Germany's watch industry production decreased by 11.7% compared to the same period last year, while the German Democratic Republic increased by 19.7%; during the same period, West Germany's leather shoe manufacturing industry decreased by 9.4%, while the German Democratic Republic conversely increased by 11%.

Comparing Foreign Trade

Professor Kahn emphasized that the situation in foreign trade is similar to that in industrial production. In the first quarter of this year, West Germany's total import and export trade volume only increased by a negligible 0.8% compared to the same period last year, while during the same period, the German Democratic Republic increased by 16%. It is worth noting that the German Democratic Republic's trade volume with other socialist countries increased by no less than 25% during this period. Although the detailed situation of West Germany's foreign trade in the first quarter of this year has not yet been announced, judging from the situation in 1958, West Germany's total trade volume with capitalist countries throughout the year decreased by approximately 0.7%, while its trade volume with socialist countries increased by 36% (of which: imports increased by 17%, and exports even increased by 55%). This in turn fully demonstrates the strong strength of the socialist system.

Professor Kahn finally pointed out that the above comparison shows that the German Democratic Republic has made important progress in the economic competition with West Germany. It is confident that it will win the final victory in this competition. (Attached charts)

    两个德国　两种制度　两样结果
    新华社讯　柏林消息：“新德意志报”最近刊载了德国经济研究所所长康恩教授写的一篇文章，题目是“在同西德进行的经济竞赛中取得的成就”。文章通过具体数字把两个德国在最近时期中工业生产和对外贸易的情况作了鲜明对比，有力地表明社会主义的德意志民主共和国正在经济上迅速赶上和超过垄断资本主义的西德。
    对比工业增长率
    康恩教授写道：1958年同1957年相比，西德工业生产增长率由5.7％降低到3.1％，而同期内德意志民主共和国的工业生产增长率却由7.4％上升为10.9％。如果按增长的绝对产值来计算，1958年西德工业生产总值只比1957年增加了三十九亿马克，平均每个西德居民只摊到八十马克；而同期内德意志民主共和国的工业生产总值却增长了五十六亿马克，每个居民可均摊到三百二十马克。
    康恩教授接着说，同西德经济部长的说法相反，西德工业生产在1959年第一季度的情况丝毫没有改善。在这个季度内，西德工业生产的增长率更进一步降低到2.5％。同期内德意志民主共和国的工业生产增长率却是9.8％；在今年头四个月内甚至提高到了12.4％。
    对比煤炭生产
    康恩教授指出，西德煤业仍然处在危机中。销不出去的硬煤早在4月底就已经达到了一千六百万吨。今年第一季度内西德焦炭产量比去年同期减少了大约11.7％，褐煤减产6.3％，煤砖减产9.3％；而同期内德意志民主共和国的焦炭、褐煤和煤砖产量分别提高了3.6％、4.4％和4％。一年来，西德煤矿不仅裁减了三万矿工，而且留下的矿工被迫“歇班”四百万人次，损失工资在一亿马克以上。目前鲁尔煤矿主协会正在关闭“不赚钱的”矿井和解雇所有那些每班采煤不足一千公斤的矿工。
    对比钢铁和机器制造
    康恩教授接着谈到两个德国的钢铁生产情况，他写道，今年第一季度西德生铁比去年同期减产14.6％，原钢减产13.7％，钢材减产17.3％；而同期内德意志民主共和国的生铁增产11.6％，原钢增产7.3％，钢材增产6.8％。
    康恩教授写道，西德的机器制造业是那些到今年初才进入危机阶段的工业部门之一。它在今年第一季度的产量较去年同期减少了4％，而同时期内德意志民主共和国机器制造业的产量却增加了15.3％。他强调说，机器制造业的生产数字恰恰揭示了西德的资本主义制度同德意志民主共和国的社会主义经济之间迥然不同的发展速度。因为许多其他工业部门的生产，特别是今后几年内工业生产中的机械化和自动化，首先要取决于今天机器制造业生产的发展。
    康恩教授接着说，甚至就同西德那些目前还处在“景气”状态的工业部门相比，社会主义制度也显出了明显的优越性。例如，西德化学工业的生产虽然还增加了7.5％，但是仍低于德意志民主共和国的增长率9.3％；西德电气器材工业生产的增长率10.7％也低于德意志民主共和国同一工业部门的生产增长率16％。
    对比消费品生产
    康恩教授说，在消费品生产方面的情况更是明显　例如，今年第一季度西德手表业比去年同期减产11.7％，而德意志民主共和国增产19.7％；同期内西德皮鞋制造业减产9.4％，而德意志民主共和国相反增产11％。
    对比对外贸易
    康恩教授强调说，对外贸易的情况也同工业生产的情况相类似。今年第一季度内西德进出口贸易总额只比去年同期增加了微不足道的0.8％，而同期内德意志民主共和国却增长了16％。值得指出的是，德意志民主共和国在这一时期内对其他社会主义国家的贸易额增长了不下25％。西德今年第一季度对外贸易的详细情况虽然尚未公布，但从1958年的情况来看，西德对资本主义各国的全年贸易额缩减了大约0.7％，而它对社会主义各国的贸易额却增长了36％（其中：进口额增加了17％，出口额甚至增加了55％）。这反过来也充分显示了社会主义制度的雄厚力量。
    康恩教授最后指出，以上的对比表明，德意志民主共和国在同西德的经济竞赛中已经取得了重要的进展。它确信自己将在这场竞赛中赢得最后胜利。（附图表）
