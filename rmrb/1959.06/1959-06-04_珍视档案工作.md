    Cherish Archive Work
    In the eyes of the average person, archive work is "ordinary" work. However, "ordinary" can also produce "extraordinary." Liang Tiancai, the archivist of the CPC Xichuan County Committee, has made outstanding achievements in this position and has become an indispensable assistant to the Party in the cause of socialist construction.
    Archive materials are the country's valuable wealth. Economy, culture, construction, and scientific research are inseparable from it, and politics, military affairs, diplomacy, and the daily work of agencies also need it. Fully utilizing archive materials can provide us with reliable reference materials in construction and daily work, making decisions and plans in line with actual conditions, reducing or avoiding errors, and completing work tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way. The Xichuan County Flood Control Office, for example, used the "unstable mountain condition" information compiled by Liang Tiancai, which saved fourteen households of working people living on the hillside from the danger of house destruction and personal injury.
    Our country is advancing rapidly, and the importance of archive work is becoming increasingly obvious. However, this work is still very young in our country, having only started in recent years, and there is not much accumulated experience. How can we fully utilize archive materials to serve socialist construction? We are grateful for the many good methods and experiences created by many archive workers in last year's Great Leap Forward. At this national archive work advanced experience exchange meeting attended by more than 1,000 representatives, advanced experiences will be summarized and exchanged, and will bear even more fruitful results across the country, enabling our country's young archive work to keep up with the pace of the motherland's advancement and better serve the cause of socialist construction.

    珍视档案工作
    在一般人眼里，档案资料工作是“平凡”的工作。但是，“平凡”中也能出“非凡”，中共淅川县委会档案员梁天才等在这个岗位上就作出了很出色的成绩，成了党在社会主义建设事业中不可缺少的助手。
    档案资料是国家的宝贵的财富。经济、文化、建设、科学研究都离不开它，政治、军事、外交，以及机关日常工作也都需要它。充分利用档案资料，可以使我们在建设事业、日常工作得到可靠的参考材料，使决定和计划符合实际情况，减少或避免错误，多快好省地完成工作任务。淅川县防汛办公室就因为用了梁天才整理的
  “山势不稳”的资料，使十四户住在山坡上的劳动人民免于遭受毁房伤人的危险。
    我们国家在一日千里地前进，档案资料工作的重要性也越来越明显。但是，这项工作在我国还很年轻，只是最近几年才开展起来，积累的经验还不多。怎样才能充分利用档案资料为社会主义建设服务呢？我们感谢许多档案资料工作人员在去年大跃进中创造的许多好办法好经验。在这次有一千多代表参加的全国档案资料工作先进经验交流会上，先进的经验将经过总结、交流，在全国结出更丰硕的果实，使我国年轻的档案工作跟上祖国前进的步伐，更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。
