The Translation of "Complete Works of Pavlov" is Nearing Completion

    The translation of the "Complete Works of Pavlov," organized by the People's Medical Publishing House, is nearing completion.

    Ivan Petrovich Pavlov was a great Soviet physiologist. His early outstanding research on the physiology of circulation and digestion had already made him the most prominent master of physiology in the world at that time. The doctrines he founded, including the theory of nerves, the principle of the unity and integrity of the organism, the unity of the organism and the environment, and the theory of higher nervous activity, opened a new era in physiology. This theory not only caused a profound revolution in biological sciences and medicine, but also had a huge impact on psychology and pedagogy. It laid a solid foundation in natural science for the Marxist-Leninist theory of knowledge with countless accurate experiments.

    The "Complete Works of Pavlov" is divided into six volumes, totaling eight books. The first volume contains papers on the circulatory system, among which the research on the trophic nerve domination and blood pressure regulation mechanisms is the most prominent. The second volume consists entirely of papers on the digestive system, of which the author's exquisite research on the activity of digestive glands and original research methods are particularly worthy of attention. The third and fourth volumes both relate to higher nervous activity and are important parts of the complete works. The fourth volume, "Lectures on the Work of the Two Hemispheres of the Brain," is a systematic exposition of the theory of higher nervous activity. The third volume contains sixty-three lectures by the author on higher nervous activity. The fifth volume is Pavlov's physiology lecture notes at the medical school, which clearly reflects the characteristics of Pavlov's lectures: first demonstrating the experiment, drawing conclusions, and then beginning to explain. The sixth volume mainly contains Pavlov's speeches on various occasions, from which one can get a glimpse of Pavlov's thoughts, life, and social activities.

    The Chinese translation of "Complete Works of Pavlov" is based on the original Russian version. The fourth volume was published in 1957. The first half of the second volume has been published, and the second half is about to be published. The first and fifth volumes are in printing and will be published soon. The third and sixth volumes will also be printed soon.

Discussion on "Meridians and Acupuncture"

    According to the "Science News," the Institute of Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Shanghai First Medical College recently jointly held an academic symposium on meridians and acupuncture with the participation of other units. The meeting launched a discussion on the methods and approaches to studying meridians and acupuncture.

    Regarding the study of meridians, opinions were very divided. Some comrades believe that meridians are a reflection of the complex functional connections in the body, and that this connection is also related to morphological structure. Other comrades believe that this connection is mainly realized through the action of the nervous system. Still other comrades believe that meridians cannot be an unknown morphological structure, and it is futile to focus on morphology. Some comrades attempted to find the basis for meridians from embryonic development. One comrade believes that the efficacy of acupuncture is a fact and should be studied, but the theory of meridians is unfounded, it can only be called a hypothesis, and it is very difficult to study it.

    Regarding how to study acupuncture, there are also some different views. Many comrades attempt to find ways to solve the mechanism of acupuncture from the functional state of the central nervous system and the relationship between the interior and exterior of the body. Other comrades believe that the mechanism of acupuncture is very complex and must be explored from all aspects. Some comrades advocate starting research from the analysis of specific cases.

Discussion on the Object of Statistical Study

    In late May, Renmin University of China convened a discussion on the issue of "How to Strengthen the Theoretical Nature of Statistics Lectures." Teachers from the statistics department of the university, teachers from relevant schools in Beijing, teachers from financial and economic colleges and universities in various provinces and cities, and comrades from relevant business departments attended the meeting. At the meeting, a debate arose regarding the object of statistics.

    Some comrades expressed their disagreement with the following definition of the object of statistics: "Statistics is an independent social science. It closely links the qualitative aspects of a large number of social phenomena to study the quantitative aspects of a large number of social phenomena. It studies the quantitative manifestations of social development laws under specific locations and time conditions. Statistics studies the quantitative aspects of social production in the unity of productive forces and production relations, and studies the quantitative aspects of social cultural life and political life phenomena." They believe that the object of statistical study should mainly be the internal connections and regularities of economic phenomena.

    Some comrades disagreed with this view, believing that the above definition is correct. They also said that we cannot deny that the object of statistics is to study the quantitative aspects of social and economic phenomena because of the past tendency to engage in statistics for the sake of statistics; we cannot deny the study of quantity in order to emphasize the study of quality.

    In addition, other definitions were also proposed at the meeting. For example, some comrades said that statistics is a social science that reveals and studies the contradictions in social life from a quantitative perspective and proposes solutions to the contradictions. Some comrades believe that the object of statistical study is the statistical method itself.

    “巴甫洛夫全集”中译工作接近完成
    “巴甫洛夫全集”中译本的翻译工作，由人民卫生出版社组织力量进行，现已接近完成。
    伊·彼·巴甫洛夫是苏联伟大的生理学家。他早年关于循环和消化生理学的卓越研究，就已使他成为当时世界上最杰出的生理学大师。他所创立的学说，包括神经论，机体统一整体性、机体环境统一性的原理，以及高级神经活动学说，在生理学中开辟了一个新纪元。这个学说不仅在生物科学和医学中引起了深刻的革命，而且对心理学和教育学等也产生了巨大的影响。它以无数准确的实验，给马克思列宁主义的认识论进一步奠定了坚强的自然科学基础。
    “巴甫洛夫全集”分为六卷，计有八册。第一卷收载循环系统方面的论文，其中有关营养神经支配和血压调节机制的研究是最突出的。第二卷都是消化系统方面的论文，特别值得重视的是作者对于消化腺活动所作精湛的研究和独创的研究方法。第三卷和第四卷都涉及高级神经活动，是全集的重要部分。其中第四卷为“大脑两半球工作讲义”，是高级神经活动学说的有系统的阐述。第三卷包含作者有关高级神经活动的六十三篇讲演。第五卷为巴甫洛夫在医学院所作的生理学讲义，清楚地体现出巴甫洛夫讲课的特点：先作示教实验，得出概念，而后开始讲解。第六卷主要收载巴甫洛夫在各种场合所作的讲话，从此可以窥见巴甫洛夫的思想、生活和社会活动的一斑。
    “巴甫洛夫全集”中译本是根据俄文原本翻译的。第四卷已于1957年出版。第二卷已出上册，下册即将出版。第一卷和第五卷在印刷中，将在最近出版。第三卷和第六卷不久也将付印。
    关于“经络和针灸”问题的讨论
    根据“科学报”报道，中国科学院生理研究所和上海第一医学院，不久前曾联合召开了有其他单位参加的，关于经络和针灸问题的学术座谈会。会议就研究经络、针灸的方法和途径，展开了讨论。
    关于研究经络的问题，意见很分歧。有的同志认为经络是机体中复杂机能联系的反映，这种联系和形态结构也有关。另一些同志认为，这种联系主要是通过神经系统的作用来实现的。又有同志认为，经络不可能是一条未知的形态结构，在形态上下功夫是徒劳的。有的同志企图从胚胎发育中来寻找经络的依据。有位同志则认为，针灸有疗效是事实，也应该研究，但经络学说则是没有根据的，它只能称为假说，要研究它是十分困难的。
    关于如何研究针灸的问题，也有些不同的看法。不少同志企图从中枢神经系统的机能状态、机体的表里关系来寻找解决针灸作用机制的途径。另一些同志则认为针灸的作用机制是很复杂的，必须从各个方面来进行探索。有的同志则主张从分析具体病例出发来进行研究。
    关于统计学研究对象的讨论
    5月下旬中国人民大学召开了“如何加强统计学讲义的理论性”问题的讨论会。参加会议的有该校统计系教师，北京有关学校教师，各省市财经院校的教师，和有关业务部门的同志。在会上关于统计学的对象问题，发生了争论。
    有的同志表示不能同意关于统计学对象的这样的定义，即：“统计学是独立的社会科学。它密切联系着大量社会现象的质的方面来研究大量社会现象的量的方面，它研究社会发展规律在具体的地点和时间条件下的量的表现。统计学在生产力和生产关系的统一当中去研究社会生产的量的方面，并研究社会的文化生活和政治生活现象的量的方面”。他们认为，统计学的研究对象主要应该是经济现象的内在联系和规律性。
    有些同志不同意这种看法，他们认为上述定义是正确的。并且说，不能因为过去工作中发生了为统计而统计等的偏向，现在就否认统计学的对象是研究社会经济现象的量的方面；不能为了强调对质的研究而否定对量的研究。
    此外，在会上也提出了别的定义，如有的同志说，统计学是一门社会科学，它是从数量方面揭露和研究社会生活中的矛盾，并提出解决矛盾的办法。有的同志认为统计学研究的对象就是统计方法本身。
