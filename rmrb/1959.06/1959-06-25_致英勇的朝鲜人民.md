To the Brave Korean People!
Huang Tianpei
　　Brave Korean people!
　　I have admired you for a long time. The South Gate bomb was shocking, (Note 1)
　　The Myongwolgwan telephone registration (Note 2) competed to sacrifice for the country.
　　I visited Seoul three times,
　　Listening to these stories, I am sure that Korea's future is bright.
　　Brave! Brave!
　　Supporting each other, the Chinese and Korean people,
　　Will always be good brothers. Brave Korean people!
　　I have admired you even more in the past ten years. After driving away one wolf, another tiger came,
　　Under the joint combat of the Chinese and Korean people, the Battle of Triangle Hill ended in utter defeat,
　　Panmunjom was forced to sign,
　　Seeing another imperialism,
　　Finally ended in shameful failure.
　　Striving for North-South unification,
　　Is justice, is reason,
　　Especially the consistent demand of the Chinese and Korean people.
　　Brave! Brave!
　　　　　Supporting each other,
　　The Chinese and Korean people,
　　　　Will always be good brothers.
　　Note 1: On September 2, 1918, Japanese Governor-General Saito got off the train at Seoul's South Gate Railway Station, and a bomb exploded, injuring countless people. The bomber was an old man in his sixties, Jiang Yu-kui.
　　Note 2: In 1919, Korean patriots Son Byong-hee and others gathered at Myongwolgwan to issue a declaration of independence. Scouts went everywhere, and the patriots each reported their names to the police station by telephone from Myongwolgwan, and were all arrested.

    致英勇的朝鲜人民
    黄天培英勇的朝鲜人民！
  我很早敬爱你们。南大门炸弹惊人，（注一）
  明月楼电话报名，（注二）争先为国牺牲。
  我三次游汉城，
    听讲这些故事，肯定朝鲜前途光明。
  英勇！英勇！
    相扶相助，中朝两国人民，
  永远是好弟兄。英勇的朝鲜人民！
  十年来更敬爱你们。去一头狼，来一头虎，
  在中朝人民并肩作战下，上甘岭一败涂地，
      板门店被迫签字，
    看又一个帝国主义，
      终于失败可耻。
    争取南北统一，
      是正义、是公理，
    特别是中朝人民要求一致。
      英勇！英勇！
          相扶相助，
    中朝两国人民，
      永远是好兄弟。
    注一：1918年9月2日日本总督斋藤从汉城南大门火车站下车，炸弹一声，受伤无数。投弹者为六十多岁老翁姜宇奎。
    注二：1919年朝鲜志士孙秉熙等集明月楼发表独立宣言，侦查四出，志士们各从明月楼以电话自报姓名于警署，一律被捕。
