    Enthusiastically Save

    Saving may seem like a small matter in personal life; each deposit may seem like a very small amount. In fact, when everyone's savings are pooled together, it becomes a considerable economic force that the country can use to do many important things. In recent years, thanks to the continuous increase in the income of our people and the increasingly deep-rooted principles of diligent housekeeping and building the country through thrift, the total amount of savings in urban areas across the country had reached four billion yuan by the end of last year. It can be seen that it is no exaggeration to say that saving can powerfully support national construction.

    Developing the social savings business can cultivate a social atmosphere of thrift and hard work among the people. This social atmosphere needs to be greatly promoted at present and for a considerable period in the future. We know that to develop production, we must rely on the people of the whole country to be diligent and thrifty, practice strict economy, continuously increase accumulation for the country, so that every penny of funds can play as large a role as possible, and every bit of material can be used in the most necessary places. This year, China's national economy will be further developed on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. In order to achieve greater achievements in production and construction, the people of the whole country must continue to implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift and vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy. Premier Zhou pointed out in his "Government Work Report" at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress: "We should mobilize the enthusiasm of every worker, farmer, intellectual, and every patriotic citizen in every corner of the country ideologically and politically, and immediately launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy." In addition to all enterprises striving to improve labor productivity, improve product quality, increase production, and practice strict economy; every person with the ability to save, based on the principle of diligence and thrift, should enthusiastically participate in savings on the basis of arranging their lives well, and do their best to accumulate construction funds for the country. This is also an important part of the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    This year, the development of the social savings business has better conditions than ever before. First of all, since the Great Leap Forward last year, the employed population in cities and industrial and mining areas has increased, and the wages paid by the state have also increased accordingly. Many employee families have changed from one person earning wages to two or more people having wage income. The savings ability of these employees has obviously increased. Secondly, the vast majority of our people have shown great enthusiasm for purchasing national construction bonds issued by the state over the years, and this year the state has stopped issuing nationwide bonds, and most areas have not issued local bonds; by carrying out savings business, concentrating the money that the masses are prepared to buy bonds with to support construction is not only beneficial to the country, but also because deposits are more flexible than buying bonds, it will certainly be more readily accepted by the masses.

    However, not everyone currently understands the significance of saving correctly. For example, some people think that now that production has greatly developed and life is guaranteed, there is no need to continue saving. This view is not appropriate. We know that in order to improve people's lives, we must first continuously develop production. In recent years, although our country's production has greatly increased, and the volume of commodity circulation has also expanded year by year; the consumer needs of the masses are also constantly growing, and the growth of consumer needs is always faster than the growth of production. We are now working hard to develop production precisely to better meet the growing consumer needs of the broad masses of the people. Our proposition is to improve life on the basis of doing a good job in production, rather than separating from the production base and unilaterally emphasizing the improvement of life. Under the current circumstances where our country's social products are not yet abundant, it is particularly important to arrange life according to the spirit of diligence and thrift. Extravagance and waste in life must be opposed. In fact, not paying attention to saving is the beginning of waste. We often see that some people's wage income is quite ample, and they can live a good life. However, they usually do not pay attention to saving, and naturally develop the habit of spending money casually. They never consider what to do tomorrow after today has passed.
  "Rich for three days after payday, worried and anxious at the end of the month" is a true reflection of such people. We believe that every family and every individual should arrange their lives in the spirit of thrift: do not buy things that are not needed temporarily, and buy less or not buy things that can be bought or not; consume more of commodities that are in relatively sufficient supply; and consume less of commodities that are temporarily in short supply. In short, think of tomorrow today, think of the end of the month at the beginning of the month, and think of times of large expenses when expenses are small. Accumulate surplus money and money that is not temporarily used, and deposit it in the bank. This not only supports national construction and makes personal or family life more planned; but also with savings, you can cope with unexpected needs that may arise temporarily, without affecting normal life because of unexpected needs.

    Some people think that only people with wealthy economic income can save. In fact, this is not the case. People with high incomes can participate in fixed deposits, which can indeed increase the funds available to the state; but even if the income is not high, depositing and withdrawing successively can also increase the funds available to the state. The savings business involves depositing and withdrawing, with deposits and withdrawals taking place alternately. This is like a passenger car, although people get off at every station, people also get on at every station, so the number of people on the car always remains at a certain level.

    Of course, our advocacy of saving and opposing waste does not mean that even the normal cultural and recreational life of the masses should be opposed as waste. People's lives are diverse. Not only do they need to eat and wear clothes, but they also need cultural and recreational activities. Consumption for cultural and recreational purposes cannot be said to be waste. Not only that, but relevant departments should also strengthen their work in this area. For example, expanding the performance of various operas and movies, holding various sports competitions, and strengthening service businesses in other aspects of cultural and recreational life, etc. We want to make the cultural life of the broad masses of the people increasingly rich and colorful.

    The institutions of the People's Bank of China at all levels that handle savings business should adapt to the requirements of the broad masses of the people and further strengthen the savings business. In carrying out savings business, we must resolutely implement the savings principles of "voluntary deposit, free withdrawal, and confidentiality for depositors." However, adhering to the principle of voluntariness should never be understood as passively waiting. On the contrary, savings institutions must continuously improve service conditions and improve working methods to make it convenient for depositors to deposit and withdraw money, and be happy to save. To oppose saving and developing production and improving life, and to oppose voluntary saving and in-depth publicity and specific organization of work, such ideas and practices are not conducive to the rapid development of the savings business.

    The savings business is a social activity with broad mass participation, and requires strong support from relevant departments. People's committees at all levels, people's organizations at all levels, and propaganda departments should, according to specific conditions and in conjunction with the movement to increase production and practice economy, conduct in-depth propaganda and education on building the country through diligence and thrift, diligent housekeeping, and saving in their respective regions and units to employees and residents, so that more people understand the important significance of participating in savings and encourage more people to enthusiastically participate in savings.

### 踊跃储蓄

    踊跃储蓄
    储蓄，看来只是个人生活范围的小事；每一笔存款，看来也是很微小的数目。其实，把大家所存的钱汇集在一起，就成了一支不小的经济力量，国家可以用来做很多重要的事情。几年来，由于我国人民的收入不断增加，和勤俭持家、勤俭建国的方针越来越深入人心，到去年年底，全国城镇的储蓄总额已达到四十亿元。可见，说储蓄可以有力地支援国家建设，是一点也不夸大的。
    发展社会储蓄事业，可以培养人民勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的社会风气。这种社会风气，在目前，在今后相当长的时期内，都需要大大提倡。我们知道，要发展生产，必须依靠全国人民克勤克俭，厉行节约，不断地为国家增加积累，使每一文资金都发挥尽可能大的作用，使每一点物资都使用到最必要的地方。今年我国国民经济将要在去年大跃进的基础上进一步发展。为了在生产建设上取得更大的成就，全国人民必须继续贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，大力开展增产节约运动。周总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所做的“政府工作报告”中指出：“我们应当在全国的每一个角落，从思想上政治上动员每一个工人、农民、知识分子和每一个爱国的公民的积极性，立即开展一个增产节约的全民运动。”除了一切企业单位都要努力提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，增加生产，厉行节约以外；每一个有储蓄能力的人，本着勤俭持家的原则，在安排好生活的基础上，踊跃地参加储蓄，尽己所能地为国家积累建设资金，这也是增产节约运动的一个重要内容。
    今年，发展社会储蓄事业，比过去任何时候都具有更好的条件。首先，去年大跃进以来，城市和工矿区的就业人口增加了，国家支付的工资也相应地增加了。不少职工家庭由一个人挣工资，变成了两个人或者更多的人都有工资收入。这些职工的储蓄能力显然是提高了。其次，我国广大人民历年来对购买国家发行的建设公债都表现了极大的热情，而今年国家停止发行全国性的公债，绝大部分地区也并没有发行地方公债；通过开展储蓄业务，把广大群众准备购买公债的钱集中起来，支援建设，这不仅有利于国家，而且由于存款比购买公债更灵活，一定更为群众所乐于接受。
    可是，对于节约储蓄的意义，目前并不是每一个人都认识得很正确。例如有些人就认为，现在生产有了很大发展，生活有了保障，再继续储蓄已经没有必要了。这种看法是不够妥当的。我们知道，为要提高人民的生活，首先需要不断地发展生产。几年来，我们国家生产虽然有了巨大的增长，商品流通额也一年年地扩大；但是群众的消费需要也是不断增长的，而且消费需要的增长总是比生产增长得更快。我们现在努力发展生产，正是为了更好地满足广大人民日益增长的消费需要。我们的主张是，在搞好生产的基础上改善生活，而不是脱离生产基础，片面地强调改善生活。在目前我国社会产品还不丰富的情况下，特别要根据勤俭节约的精神安排生活。生活上的铺张浪费现象，是必须反对的。事实上，不注意节约，就是浪费的开始。我们常常看到，有些人工资收入相当宽裕，日子满可以过得很好。但是他们平常不注意节约储蓄，很自然地养成了随便花钱的习惯。他们从来不考虑过了今天，明天该怎么办。
  “发薪三天富，月末空着急”正是这种人的写照。我们认为，每个家庭每个人，都应当本着节约的精神来安排生活：暂时不需用的东西不买，可买可不买的东西少买或不买；供应比较充分的商品可以多消费一点；一时供应不充分的商品就少消费一点。总之，要在今天想到明天，月初想到月底，开支小的时候想到开支大的时候。把余钱和暂时不用的钱积蓄起来，存入银行。这样不但支援了国家建设，使个人或家庭生活过得更有计划；而且有了储蓄，还可以应付临时发生的意外需要，而不至于因为意外需要，使得正常生活受到影响。
    有些人认为，只有经济收入富裕的人才能储蓄。其实不然。收入多的人参加定期储蓄，固然能够增加国家手中可以运用的资金；但即使收入不多，陆续存入，陆续支取，也同样能够增加国家手中可以运用的资金。储蓄业务是有存有取，存取交替进行的，这就像一列客车，虽然每站都有人下车，但每站也都有人上车，因而车上总是保持着一定的人数的道理一样。
    当然，我们提倡节约储蓄，反对浪费，并不是连群众的正常的文化娱乐生活也当作浪费一起反掉。人民的生活是多种多样的。不仅要穿衣吃饭，而且需要文化娱乐。对于用于文化娱乐的消费，不能说是浪费。不仅如此，有关部门还应当加强这方面的工作。例如扩大各种戏曲和电影的演出，举办各种体育运动比赛，以及加强其它文化娱乐生活方面的服务业务等。我们要让广大群众的文化生活日益变得丰富多采。
    各地人民银行办理储蓄业务的机构，都应当适应广大群众的要求，进一步加强储蓄业务工作。在开展储蓄业务中，必须坚决执行“存款自愿，取款自由，为存户保密”的储蓄原则。但是，坚持自愿原则，绝不应当理解为消极等待。恰恰相反，储蓄机构必须不断地改进服务状况，改进工作方法，做到让存户存款取款方便，乐于节约储蓄。把节约储蓄和发展生产、改善生活对立起来，把自愿储蓄和深入宣传具体组织的工作对立起来，这种想法和做法都是不利于储蓄事业的迅速发展的。
    储蓄事业是带有广泛群众性的社会活动，需要有关部门的大力支持。各级人民委员会，各级人民团体和宣传部门，应当根据具体条件，结合增产节约运动，在本地区、本单位向职工和居民进行一次深入的关于勤俭建国，勤俭持家，节约储蓄的宣传教育，让更多的人都懂得参加储蓄的重要意义，鼓动更多的人来踊跃参加储蓄。
