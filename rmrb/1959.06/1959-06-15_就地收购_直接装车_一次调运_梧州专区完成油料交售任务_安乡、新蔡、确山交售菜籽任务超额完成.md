Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 14th: The Wuzhou Special District in Guangxi has exceeded its semi-annual oil and fat unified purchase task by 2%. The total amount of fats and oils (calculated as oil) stored in the entire district is more than 14,000 dan.

The Party committees at all levels in Wuzhou Special District attach great importance to the unified purchase of oils and fats. In April, the CPC Wuzhou District Committee held a meeting, requiring all counties to seize the oil procurement work and ensure the completion of the unified purchase task. After the meeting, the county party secretaries took the lead, investigated oil sources, and vigorously publicized the unified purchase policy. The Mengshan County Party Committee uniformly arranged labor to collect tea seeds and process oil. The grain departments of the special district adopted the method of on-site purchase, direct loading, and one-time transportation to towns for areas close to traffic lines and near national warehouses, reducing the labor force for transporting to the warehouse by the masses; for areas with insufficient oil processing capacity, more oilseeds were purchased and less oil was purchased so that the masses could sell in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 14th: As of June 9, Anxiang County, Hunan Province, had stored 667,000 catties of rapeseed, exceeding the unified purchase task for this year by 1.1%.

The party organizations of various communes and production brigades in Anxiang County, according to the instructions of the CPC Anxiang County Committee, implemented the spirit of quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick transportation and storage, and organized the labor force to quickly send the rapeseed to be sold to the national warehouse. Zhu Shoukun, the party general branch secretary of the Hu'an Brigade of the Anwen Commune, led 38 members and completed the task of selling rapeseed in one day. The Yucai Commune organized 24 cadres to assist in the work of the production teams, quickly completed the task of selling rapeseed, and immediately concentrated it at the transshipment station. The Anli Commune sent out 57 peddlers to transport industrial products to the countryside and purchase rapeseed for storage.

The grain department of Anxiang County reasonably increased the number of purchasing points to facilitate the masses' sales. During this period, the rapeseed concentration areas opened all oil presses, collecting seeds and squeezing oil at the same time, leaving rapeseed cakes as fertilizer. Communes arranged manpower to squeeze oil in shifts, and the daily pressing volume of each press was increased from the original 800-1,000 catties to 1,400-1,600 catties. A large amount of dried cake was transported to various production teams and work groups, and the members were very happy. Li Jinbang of the Hu'an Brigade of the Anwen Commune said: Now some third-class seedlings need dried cake fertilizer. Selling rapeseed to the state in time not only supports national construction but also solves the current fertilizer shortage problem for third-class seedlings. It is truly a win-win situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th: In the past week, on both sides of the Huai River in Henan Province, groups of large and small vehicles loaded with rapeseed can be seen heading towards the national purchasing stations every day. The amount of rapeseed purchased by the eighteen counties and cities in the Xinyang Special District along the Huai River has exceeded the total amount purchased last year, and the market supply is still increasing. Counties such as Xincai and Queshan have completed this year's rapeseed purchase plan.

    就地收购　直接装车　一次调运
    梧州专区完成油料交售任务
    安乡、新蔡、确山交售菜籽任务超额完成
    新华社南宁14日电　广西梧州专区已超额2％完成了上半年的油料和油脂统购任务，全专区入库油脂及油料（折油计算）共一万四千多担。
    梧州专区各级党委十分重视油脂油料的统购工作。4月间，中共梧州地委曾经召开会议，要求各县抓紧油料统购工作，保证完成统购任务。会后，各县党委书记挂帅，调查油源，大力宣传统购政策。蒙山县党委统一安排劳动力上山收摘茶子和加工油料。专区的粮食部门，对靠近交通沿线和离国家仓库近的地区，采取就地收购、直接装车、一次调运到城镇的办法，减少群众运送入库的劳动力；对油脂加工力量不足的地区，就多收油料，少收油脂，使群众能及时出售。
    新华社长沙14日电　湖南省安乡县到6月9日止，已入库油菜籽六十六万七千斤，超额1.1％完成了今年的菜籽统购任务。
    安乡县各公社和生产大队的党组织，根据中共安乡县委的指示，贯彻快收快打快运送入库的精神，组织劳动力，把应交售的菜籽迅速送入国家仓库。安文公社护安大队党总支书记朱守坤，带领三十八个社员，一天就完成了交售菜籽的任务。育才公社组织二十四个干部到生产队协助工作，很快就完成了菜籽交售任务，并且随即集运到转运站。安澧公社派出五十七副货郎担，运送工业品下乡，收购菜籽入库。
    安乡县粮食部门合理增设了收购点，便利群众送售。在这期间，菜籽集中产区把油榨全部开放，边收籽、边榨油，剩下菜饼作肥料。各公社都安排人力轮班榨油，每座榨的每日压榨量，由原来八百至一千斤，提高到一千四百斤至一千六百斤。大量枯饼源源运到各生产队、作业组，社员们非常高兴。安文公社护安大队李金榜说：现在有一部分三类禾苗，正需要枯饼肥料，及时把菜籽卖给国家，不仅支援了国家建设，同时解决了当前三类禾的缺肥问题，真是一举两得。
    据新华社郑州14日电　最近一个星期来，在河南省淮河两岸，每天都可以看到满载油菜籽的大车小车成群结队拥向国家收购站。淮河沿岸信阳专区十八个县、市目前收购的油菜籽，已经超过去年全年的收购量，而上市量还在增加。新蔡、确山等县已经完成了今年的油菜籽收购计划。山东郯城县红茹人民公社大院子生产队的送粮车队。原一萍摄
