Difficulties and Drive

Why is it that under the same conditions of tight schedules and heavy tasks, the Nanchang Foundry, with its good equipment and strong technology, has low product quality? Why is it that the Nanchang Power Accessories Factory, with its poor equipment and weak technology, has high product quality? The answer to the question is that the leadership of the Power Accessories Factory resolutely did what could be done through subjective effort, and did it very well. The leadership of the Foundry did not do it, or did it, but due to insufficient drive, emphasizing difficulties, the result was not good.

In doing any work, one may encounter difficulties. The key lies in how to treat difficulties. "Difficulties are like springs, the stronger you are, the softer they become, the weaker you are, the stronger they become." Therefore, to overcome difficulties, it is necessary to have great drive, many methods, resolutely rely on the masses, and be good at using wisdom and strategy to make decisive decisions.

The leadership of the Nanchang Foundry has already learned its lesson, letting go and mobilizing the masses, carrying out a major quality inspection, and resolving to correct shortcomings and reverse the situation of low product quality, which is very good. We hope that factories and mines with similar situations can continue to boost their drive, actively find ways to reduce the scrap rate as much as possible, and strive towards the goal of high quality and high yield!

    困难和干劲
    为什么在同是时间紧、任务重的情况下，南昌翻砂厂设备好，技术强，产品质量反而低？为什么南昌动力配件厂，设备差，技术弱，产品质量反而高呢？问题的答案是，经过主观努力能够做到的事情，动力配件厂的领导上坚决去做了，而且做得很好；而翻砂厂领导上却没有去做，或者做了，但由于干劲不足，强调困难，结果没有做好。
    做任何工作，都可能遇到困难。关键在于怎样对待困难。“困难是弹簧，你强它就软，你软它就强”。因此，要战胜困难，一定要干劲大，办法多，坚决依靠群众，善于用智用谋当机立断。
    南昌翻砂厂领导上已经接受教训，放手发动群众，开展质量大检查，下决心改正缺点，扭转产品质量低的状况，这很好。我们希望有同样情况的工厂矿山，都能不断鼓足干劲，积极找办法，尽力降低废品率，向优质高产的目标奋进！
