    Implement the System of School Affairs Committee Responsibility Under the Leadership of the Party Committee
    Liu Yangqiao, First Secretary of the Wuhan University Party Committee
    "In all institutions of higher education, the system of School Affairs Committee responsibility under the leadership of the school Party committee should be implemented. The system of one-person leadership is prone to detachment from the leadership of the Party committee and is therefore inappropriate."
               ——Instructions on Educational Work from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council
    The "Instructions on Educational Work" from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council state: "In all institutions of higher education, the system of School Affairs Committee responsibility under the leadership of the school Party committee should be implemented. The system of one-person leadership is prone to detachment from the leadership of the Party committee and is therefore inappropriate." This leadership system was formulated after summarizing the experiences and lessons learned from the Party's work in all aspects of higher education since liberation, and is implemented on the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle. Therefore, this system is of decisive significance for improving the leadership status of institutions of higher education and raising the level of leadership. All institutions of higher education must correctly implement this new leadership system.
    The Principal Responsibility System is Prone to Detachment from the Leadership of the Party Committee
    After liberation, the principal responsibility system was widely implemented in institutions of higher education. The central idea of this system was that the principal was fully responsible for the school, the principal was the school's leader with full powers, and the school Party organization only had the responsibility to guarantee and supervise the work of the school in all aspects. It had no right to make decisions about school work. If the principal disagreed with some opinions, he could act according to his own opinions. The School Affairs Committee was only a consultative body. The result of implementing this system played a positive role in establishing a system of responsibility and overcoming the phenomenon of no one being responsible. However, the problem, as the "Instructions on Educational Work" pointed out, was that it was "prone to detachment from the leadership of the Party committee." Facts show that the leadership of the Party must never be weakened to strengthen the principal responsibility system in institutions of higher education. The core of leadership in institutions of higher education should never be a single administrative leader, but the school Party committee established in accordance with the Party's democratic centralism. After summarizing the experience of Party building, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly stipulated in the Party Constitution: "The Party's primary organizations in enterprises, rural areas, schools, and troops shall lead and supervise the administrative organs and mass organizations of their units to actively implement the resolutions of the higher Party organizations and the higher state organs, and to continuously improve the work of their units." The leading position of the Party committee in institutions of higher education was affirmed. From then on, institutions of higher education began to act in accordance with the new Party Constitution, implementing "a leadership system that combines collective leadership with individual responsibility with the Party as the core." In practice, it was the system of principal responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee. The work of all aspects of the school also began to be carried out under the leadership and supervision of the Party committee. The Party's leading position in institutions of higher education began to be established.
    Establish the Party's Leading Position in Institutions of Higher Education
    The establishment of the Party's leading position in institutions of higher education is a matter of joy for Party members and intellectuals who are willing to accept the Party's leadership and are willing to serve the cause of proletarian education under the Party's leadership. However, for anti-Party and anti-socialist Rightists, it is completely unacceptable. They want to implement "professors governing the school" and compete with the Party for the leadership of institutions of higher education. Some people with serious bourgeois educational ideas are also not convinced. These all need to be resolved through serious struggles. The school Party organization led the entire Party in the struggle. The rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the educational revolution launched last year on the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle were all victorious under the condition of strengthening the Party organization's comprehensive leadership over the school's work. It was also in the victorious struggle that the Party organization was tested, the entire Party was tempered, and the Party's comprehensive leadership over the school's work was truly established. The Rightists' attempt to seize leadership was completely crushed. Some people who in the past only admitted that the Party could lead politically, but doubted whether the Party could lead professionally, also realized that the Party is a collective that concentrates outstanding advanced fighters and uses Marxism-Leninism as a guide. Facts educated them that this strong collective can lead everything. Facts also educated them that if they leave the Party's leadership, they will not only go astray politically, but also make directional mistakes professionally because they are divorced from politics. Therefore, "listening to the Party" has begun to become the common language of the majority of people in institutions of higher education. This is the result of the struggle. This result also centrally illustrates the role of the Party in the socialist revolution on the political front, the ideological front, and the educational front, and illustrates the serious significance of establishing the leading position of the school Party organization in the school.
    Through the huge and profound revolution in education, the contradictions in all aspects of institutions of higher education have been fully exposed. We have a more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of institutions of higher education, and we have a deeper understanding of why "in all institutions of higher education, the system of School Affairs Committee responsibility under the leadership of the school Party committee should be implemented." The characteristics of institutions of higher education are prominently manifested in the following aspects: (1) The main members of institutions of higher education are intellectuals. If the struggle of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" in the entire transition period is very complex, then the complex struggle of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" in the ideological field in institutions of higher education is even more obvious; (2) The task of institutions of higher education is to cultivate new people for building socialism and communism, not to create material wealth. Although a certain amount of material wealth will be created after productive labor is incorporated into the education plan, this is a byproduct of completing the training of specialized personnel; (3) College students are specialized personnel for national construction and must have strict requirements in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education. Whether they meet these requirements can only be fully explained after they complete their studies and take up construction posts. Due to these characteristics, it is not only necessary to establish the Party's absolute leading position in institutions of higher education and implement the Party committee's collective leadership in the leadership system, but it is also necessary to establish a collective leadership system in the administrative organization. Today's central issue is how to further implement this leadership system so that it plays an active role, which is conducive to the cause of proletarian education.
    Three Aspects to Implement the System of School Affairs Committee Responsibility Under the Leadership of the Party Committee
    How to further implement the system of School Affairs Committee responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee? I believe that we must start by solving the following aspects of the problem: First, the issue of the Party committee's leadership; second, the issue of the School Affairs Committee's responsibility system; third, the issue of the responsibilities and interrelationships of the Party committee and the School Affairs Committee, as well as the responsibilities and interrelationships of the principal and the School Affairs Committee.
    Regarding the issue of the Party's leadership, it is always the most fundamental issue. The task of the school Party committee is to realize the leadership over the entire school work under the leadership of the local Party committee, to ensure the implementation of the Party's educational policy, to ensure the correct implementation of the Party and the state's policies and laws and the instructions and orders of the higher Party and government organs, and to ensure the continuous improvement of teaching quality and the completion of the state's training plan. In this way, the Party committee must be good at leading labor and also be good at leading teaching; it must be good at leading political theory teaching and also be good at leading professional teaching; it must be good at solving the problem of laborization and also be good at solving the problem of knowledge; it must be good at solving the problem of being red and also be good at solving the problem of being expert. And these problems boil down to the issue of teaching and learning, the issue of teachers and students, and the general topic is how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, and how to correctly treat educational science. Therefore, how to rapidly improve the Party's leadership level is the primary key.
    First, we must further improve the collective leadership of the Party committee, implement the principle of "walking on two legs" in our work, and fully promote the democratic style of work and the work methods of the mass line.
    Second, we must strengthen political leadership; we must clarify that professional work must be combined with political work, and teaching and administrative work must be carried out under the leadership of the Party. Major events in teaching and administrative work must be decided by the Party, but the Party committee should avoid a comprehensive leadership method and should not take everything into its own hands. Therefore, the Party committee must actively support the work of the School Affairs Committee and the principal, educate all Party members, League members, and all teachers and students to recognize that the School Affairs Committee is the school's administrative authority, obey the decisions of the School Affairs Committee and the instructions of the principal, improve the prestige of the School Affairs Committee and administrative leaders among teachers, students, and staff, and fully exploit the active role of administrative organizations and administrative leaders. The same should be done for organizations such as the trade union and the Communist Youth League.
    Third, we must adhere to the principle of combining teachers and students and promoting teaching and learning under the leadership of the Party committee, and pay attention to adjusting the relationship between teachers and students at any time, so that the leading role of teachers in teaching and the spirit of students in studying can be fully utilized. In order to maintain the continuous improvement of teachers and students, the work in all aspects must be uniformly arranged in a realistic and truth-seeking manner according to the actual situation, so as to ensure teaching time, unify thinking, unify steps, and make all work revolve around the central task of teaching, gradually overcome various contradictions in teaching work, and continuously improve teaching quality.
    Fourth, we must strengthen the education of Marxism-Leninism, improve the ideological level of Marxism-Leninism, so that those who teach teach people, and those who teach people also teach books, and integrate the ideas of Marxism-Leninism into the profession, and everyone carry out political work. To achieve this, the leading comrades of the Party committee must conscientiously study Marxist-Leninist theory, study the Party's educational theory and policies, study the issues of educational science, and solve the working methods of leading teaching. We must go deep into all aspects of teaching to lead teaching.
    Regarding the issue of the School Affairs Committee's responsibility system. The system of School Affairs Committee responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee starts from the need to strengthen both the Party's leadership and the school's administrative leadership. The functions of the two are the same and different. They should neither replace each other, nor stand in opposition to each other, nor should they take the approach of weakening one party to strengthen the other. The correct approach is that the School Affairs Committee must rely closely on the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, and take full responsibility for the school's administrative work under the leadership of the Party committee. The Party committee's leadership over the School Affairs Committee mainly means that after the Party committee decides on major issues, the Party members in the School Affairs Committee contact, discuss, and study with non-Party masses, and can revise inappropriate parts, and then discuss and pass it through the School Affairs Committee before handling it.
    The reason why institutions of higher education adopt the system of School Affairs Committee responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee, rather than the system of principal responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee, is that my understanding is that this system is more conducive to fully promoting democracy. Institutions of higher education are in contact with ideological issues all day long. The solution to these problems can only be achieved through democratic methods and persuasive methods. Without a high degree of democracy, there can be no high degree of centralism. At the same time, many problems in the school need to be discussed for a long time, and some problems are indeed difficult to draw conclusions for a while. Therefore, the School Affairs Committee includes not only the main administrative leaders at the school and department levels, but also representative figures from all aspects of the school. Only in this way can a real authority be formed. It is essentially different from the School Affairs Committee of a consultative nature in the past. It is to fully manage and guide the school's administrative work under the leadership of the higher-level administrative organs and the Party committee at the same level, correctly implement the Party's educational policy and the Party and state's policies and laws, and complete the tasks assigned by the state. In order for the School Affairs Committee to truly assume its important responsibilities, in addition to the same need to improve the system of collective leadership, and the major affairs of the school are brought to the School Affairs Committee for discussion, attention must be paid to the following aspects:
    First, establish a system of responsibility in all aspects of the school, establish teaching order and work order, overcome any phenomenon of no one being responsible and all disorganized and undisciplined chaotic phenomena, and correctly exert the role of administrative organs. If these problems are not fundamentally resolved, the system of the School Affairs Committee cannot be consolidated. The Party's political work is also difficult to carry out normally according to the characteristics of the school.
    Second, be bold in taking responsibility and independently solve the problems that the School Affairs Committee should solve, and fully exert the role of the School Affairs Committee. The School Affairs Committee is an authority that is fully responsible for the school's work, so for all work that has clear instructions from the higher-level education administrative organs, or has clear rules and regulations to follow, or problems in daily administrative work and teaching affairs, the School Affairs Committee should discuss and decide in conjunction with the school's situation, and should not submit everything to the Party committee; the Party committee does not need to discuss these problems. If it is considered that some relatively major problems need to be discussed by the Party committee, the views on the problems and the solutions can be proposed together.
    Third, regularly check work, summarize the experience in teaching and administrative work, and continuously enrich leadership experience and improve leadership level.
    The above issues concerning the Party committee's leadership and the School Affairs Committee's responsibility system are only raised from some of the more important aspects of the issues that individuals have come into contact with, rather than a comprehensive discussion of these two aspects of the issue. In order to better implement this new leadership system of the School Affairs Committee responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee, it is necessary to distinguish the scope of responsibilities and interrelationships between the two as follows.
    The School Affairs Committee is an authority organization and has direct leadership responsibility for all aspects of administrative work. The central task of the School Affairs Committee should be: leading administrative organizations at all levels, implementing the Party and state's policies and guidelines, as well as educational guidelines and other policies and laws; it should be directly responsible for the quality of the school's administrative work. Therefore, reviewing and deciding on teaching, scientific research, production labor plans, and administrative work plans, supervising and inspecting the implementation of plans by administrative organs at all levels, summarizing and exchanging experiences, deciding on the establishment and changes of internal organs within the school's jurisdiction, as well as the appointment and removal of main cadres, the work of cultivating and improving teachers, reviewing and deciding on the school's budget and final accounts, formulating the school's rules and regulations, and discussing and deciding on other major issues of the school are all responsibilities that the School Affairs Committee must undertake.
    The school Party committee has leadership responsibility for all aspects of the school's work. It must provide political leadership for the various tasks directly led by the School Affairs Committee; it must review the various plans for administrative work from a political perspective, using the Party's policy viewpoints: whether it conforms to the actual situation of the school, whether it conforms to the Party's policies and guidelines, and whether it conforms to the instructions of higher-level leading organs. The Party committee must seriously discuss and decide on major issues in the school; however, it is impossible to make rigid provisions on what constitutes a major issue, but it must be realistic and truth-seeking, and proceed from reality. The Party committee must discuss and decide on all key issues in advance, and then do them separately; as for general issues, the School Affairs Committee should discuss and decide on them in advance, and then submit them to the Party committee for review. That is to say, the leadership responsibility of the Party committee is political leadership. The main method it uses to conduct leadership is to adopt the method of strengthening political work, that is, to use in-depth and meticulous political work to achieve the goal of realizing political leadership. Therefore, in addition to politically leading the work of administration, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, student unions, etc., its most frequent task is to strengthen the Party's ideological and organizational construction, so that the Party's ranks continue to consolidate and expand.
    The responsibilities of the two are different, and the methods adopted cannot be the same. However, political work and professional work are inseparable, and the Party committee and the School Affairs Committee should both attach importance to consulting each other and strive to achieve consistency in understanding and consistency in action on all major issues.
    Regarding the relationship between the principal and the School Affairs Committee: The principal is the chairman of the School Affairs Committee, is one of the collective members of the School Affairs Committee, and is responsible for implementing the decisions of the School Affairs Committee. He should report to the School Affairs Committee on important issues that occur during the execution. This is the unity of collective leadership and individual role.
      If the above aspects of the problem can be further resolved, I think it will greatly facilitate the system of School Affairs Committee responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee to truly play a role, and it will also make the Party's leadership level continuously improve, and the Party's leading position will be increasingly consolidated.

    贯彻执行党委领导下的校务委员会负责制
    中共武汉大学党委第一书记　刘仰峤
    在一切高等学校中，应当实行学校党委领导下的校务委员会负责制。
               ——中共中央、国务院“关于教育工作的指示”
    中共中央、国务院“关于教育工作的指示”中指出：“在一切高等学校中，应当实行学校党委领导下的校务委员会负责制；一长制容易脱离党委领导，所以是不妥当的。”这个领导制度，是总结了解放以来党在高等学校各方面工作中的经验教训以后规定出来的，并且是在整风和反右派斗争胜利的基础上实行。所以，这个制度对改进高等学校的领导状况，提高高等学校的领导水平，具有决定意义。各高等学校必须正确地贯彻执行这一新的领导制度。
    校长负责制容易脱离党委领导
    解放以后，在高等学校中，普遍推行了校长负责制。这个制度的最中心思想，就是校长对学校负完全责任，校长就是学校的全权领导者，学校党组织对学校中各方面的工作，只有保证监督的责任，无权对学校工作作出决定，一些意见，校长如果不同意，即可以按照他自己的意见办事；校务委员会也只是一个咨询机构。推行这种制度的结果，对于确立责任制度，克服无人负责现象等方面，是起了积极作用的。但问题正如“教育工作指示”所指出的，是“容易脱离党委领导”。事实说明，高等学校中绝不能采取削弱党的领导来加强校长负责制的办法。高等学校中的领导核心决不应该是学校行政领导者一个人，而应该是按照党的民主集中制建立起来的学校党委会。中共八届首次代表大会在总结了党的建设经验以后，在党章中明确地规定：“在企业、农村、学校和部队中党的基层组织，应当领导和监督本单位的行政机构和群众组织积极地实现上级党组织和上级国家机关的决议，不断地改进本单位的工作。”高等学校中党委的领导地位肯定了。从此，高等学校中开始根据新的党章办事，实行了“以党为核心的集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度”。实际上，也就是党委领导下的校长负责制。学校中各方面的工作也开始在党委的领导和监督下进行。党的领导地位在高等学校中开始确立了。
    确立党在高等学校中的领导地位
    党在高等学校中领导地位的确立，对党员和愿意接受党的领导并愿意在党的领导下为无产阶级教育事业服务的知识分子来说，是一件值得高兴的大事。但是对于反党反社会主义的右派分子来说，则完全不能甘心，他们要实行“教授治校”，要和党较量，争夺对高等学校的领导权；有些资产阶级教育思想严重的人，也并不心服。这都是要通过严重的斗争解决的。学校党组织领导全党进行了斗争。整风运动、反右派斗争以及去年在整风、反右派斗争取得胜利的基础上展开的教育革命，都是在加强党组织对学校工作全面领导的条件下取得胜利的。也正是在胜利的斗争中，考验了党组织，使全党受到了锻炼，真正确立了党对学校工作的全面领导。右派分子夺取领导权的企图是彻底打垮了，有些过去只承认党委在政治上可以领导，在业务上怀疑党委能否领导的人，也认识到党是一个集中了优秀的先进战士以马克思列宁主义为指南的集体。事实教育了他们，这个坚强的集体是可以领导一切的。事实也教育了他们，如果离开了党的领导，不仅会在政治上走入歧途，在业务上也会因为脱离政治而犯方向性的错误。因此，“听党的话”在高等学校中，已开始成为多数人的共同语言。这是斗争的结果。这个结果，也集中地说明了党在政治战线、思想战线以及教育战线上社会主义革命中的作用，说明了确立学校党组织在学校中领导地位的严重意义。
    高等学校经过教育事业的巨大的深刻的革命，各方面的矛盾就充分地揭露出来了。我们对于高等学校的特点，也就有了比较全面的认识，也就更深刻地认识了为什么“在一切高等学校中，应当实行学校党委领导下的校务委员负责制”。高等学校的特点，突出地表现在以下几个方面：（一）高等学校的主要成员都是知识分子，如果说，整个过渡时期“兴无灭资”的斗争都非常复杂的话，那末在高等学校中思想领域内“兴无灭资”的复杂斗争更是格外明显；（二）高等学校的任务，是培养建设社会主义和共产主义的新人，不是创造物质财富，虽然在生产劳动纳入教育计划后，也会创造出一定物质财富，但这是为完成培养建设专门人材而带来的副产物；（三）大学生是国家建设的专门人材，在德育、智育、体育方面都必须有严格的要求，是否符合这种要求，只有到学习终了走上建设岗位后，才能完全说明问题。由于这些特点，在领导制度上就不仅有必要确立党在高等学校中的绝对领导地位，实行党委的集体领导，而且也有必要在行政组织中确立集体领导制度。今天的中心问题是，如何进一步贯彻执行这个领导制度，使它发挥积极作用，以利于无产阶级的教育事业。
    要从三方面贯彻执行党委领导下的校务委员会负责制
    如何进一步地贯彻执行党委领导下的校务委员会负责制呢？我认为必须从解决以下几个方面的问题着手：一是党委的领导问题；二是校务委员会负责制问题；三是党委和校务委员会的职责与相互关系以及校长和校务委员会的职责与相互关系问题。
    关于党的领导问题，始终是最根本的问题。学校党委的任务，是在地方党委的领导下实现对整个学校工作的领导，保证党的教育方针的贯彻执行，保证党和国家的政策法令以及上级党、政机关指示命令的正确执行，保证不断地提高教学质量，完成国家的培养计划。这样，党委就既要善于领导劳动，还要善于领导教学；既要善于领导政治理论教学，还要善于领导业务教学；既要善于解决劳动化的问题，还要善于解决知识化的问题；既要善于解决红的问题，还要善于解决专的问题。而这些问题归结起来，就是教与学的问题，教师和学生的问题，总题目也就是如何正确处理人民内部矛盾，如何正确地对待教育科学的问题。所以，如何迅速提高党的领导水平，则是首要的关键。
    第一，要进一步健全党委的集体领导，在工作中贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，充分发扬民主作风和发展群众路线的工作方法。
    第二，要加强政治领导；要明确业务工作必须与政治工作结合起来，教学行政工作必须在党的领导下进行，教学行政工作中的大事要由党来决定，但党委要避免一揽子的领导方法，不要把大小事情都揽在自己身上。因此，党委必须积极支持校务委员会和校长的工作，教育全体党、团员和全体师生认识校务委员会是学校行政的权力机关，服从校务委员会的决定和校长的指示，提高校务委员会和行政领导者在师生员工中的威信，充分发挥行政组织和行政领导者的积极作用。对于工会和共青团等组织，也应当如此。
    第三，要坚持党委领导下师生结合、教学相长的原则，随时注意调整师生的关系，使教师在教学中的主导作用和学生在学习中钻研精神都能得到充分的发挥。为保持教师学生都能不断提高，对于各方面的工作要根据实际情况，实事求是地加以统一安排，以便保证教学时间，统一思想，统一步调，使各项工作都围绕教学中心任务前进，逐渐克服教学工作中的各种矛盾，不断提高教学质量。
    第四，要加强马克思列宁主义的教育，提高马克思列宁主义的思想水平，使教书的教人，教人的也教书，将马克思列宁主义的思想贯串到业务中去，人人进行政治工作。为做到这点，党委的领导同志就必须认真学习马克思列宁主义理论，学习党的教育理论和方针政策，研究教育科学的问题，解决领导教学的工作方法。要深入到教学各个环节中去领导教学。
    关于校务委员会负责制问题。党委领导下的校务委员会负责制，是从既要加强党的领导又要加强学校行政领导出发的。两者的职能有同有异。既不应彼此代替，也不能互相对立，更不能采取削弱一方加强另一方的办法。正确的办法是校务委员会必须紧紧依靠党的领导，依靠群众的支持，在党委的领导下对学校行政工作全面地负起责任。党委对校务委员会的领导，也主要是说大事由党委决定后，再经过校务委员会中的党员，同非党群众接触、商量、研究，对不妥当的部分还可以修正，然后经校务委员会讨论通过，再去办理。
    高等学校中所以采取党委领导下的校务委员会负责制，而不采取党委领导下的校长负责制，我的理解也就是这种制度更有利于充分地发扬民主。高等学校成天所接触的大都是意识形态方面的问题，这些问题的解决，是只能采用民主的办法，说服的办法。没有高度的民主，是不可能有高度的集中的。同时学校中许多问题又都是需要从长商讨，而有些问题也确实是一时难于做出结论的。因此，校务委员会中就不仅包括了校部和系一级的主要行政领导者，也包括了学校各方面有代表性的人物。只有这样，才能真正形成一个权力机关。它和过去咨询性质的校务委员会是有本质上的不同。它要在上级行政机关和同级党委领导下全权管理和指导学校的行政工作，正确贯彻执行党的教育方针和党与国家的政策法令，完成国家所交给的任务。校务委员会要真正地负起自己的重大责任，除同样必须健全集体领导的制度，学校中的重大事情都提到校务委员会上讨论外，必须在以下几个方面引起注意：
    第一、确立学校各方面的责任制，确立教学秩序和工作秩序，克服任何无人负责现象和一切无组织、无纪律的混乱现象，正确发挥行政机构的作用。不从根本上解决这些问题，校务委员会的制度是不能巩固的。党的政治工作也很难根据学校的特点，正常地进行。
    第二、要大胆负责，独立解决校务委员会应当解决的问题，充分发挥校务委员会的作用。校务委员会是对学校工作负有全责的权力机关，所以凡是上级教育行政机关有明确指示，或者有明确规章制度可以遵循的工作，或者日常行政工作与教学事务中的问题，校务委员会都应结合学校情况讨论决定，不应事事都提交党委会；党委会也不必讨论这些问题。如果认为有些比较重大的问题需要经过党委会讨论，可以将对问题的看法和解决的方案一并提出。
    第三、要定期检查工作，总结教学行政工作中的经验，不断丰富领导经验，提高领导水平。
    以上关于党委的领导问题和校务委员会负责制问题，只是就个人接触到的问题中一些比较主要的方面提出的，而不是全面论述这两方面的问题。为了更好地贯彻执行党委领导下的校务委员会负责制这一新的领导制度，两者的职责范围和相互关系有必要作如下的区分。
    校务委员会是一个权力组织，对于行政各方面的工作，都负有直接的领导责任。校务委员会的中心任务，应当是：领导行政各级组织，贯彻执行党和国家的方针政策，以及教育方针和其他政策法令；学校行政工作的好坏，它应负直接的责任。所以审查和决定教学、科学研究、生产劳动计划和行政工作计划，监督检查各级行政机构对计划的执行情况，总结交流经验，决定在学校职权范围内的校内机构设置、变动，以及主要干部的任免，培养与提高师资的工作，审查决定全校的预算决算，制定全校的规章制度，讨论并决定学校其他重大问题等，都是校务委员会所必须担负起来的责任。
    学校党委对学校各方面的工作，都负有领导责任。对校务委员会所直接领导的各项工作，要从政治上加以领导；对于行政工作各方面的计划要从政治角度，以党的政策观点来进行审查：是否符合学校的实际情况，是否符合党的方针政策，是否符合上级领导机关的指示。对于学校中的重大问题，党委要认真讨论决定；但对于什么是重大问题，则不可能作硬性的规定，而要实事求是，从实际出发。凡是关键性的问题，党委事先要讨论决定，然后分头去办；至于一般的问题，则应由校务委员会事先讨论决定，然后提交党委审查。这就是说，党委的领导职责是政治领导。它进行领导的主要办法，是采取加强政治工作的办法，即是用深入细致的政治工作去达到实现政治领导的目的。所以，它除从政治上领导行政、工会、共青团、学生会等的工作外，最经常的任务是加强党的思想建设和组织建设，使党的队伍不断地巩固扩大。
    两者的职责不同，所采取的方法也不能一样。但是，政治工作与业务工作是不可分的，党委和校务委员会彼此都应重视互相商量，力求在一切重大问题上做到认识一致，行动一致。
    关于校长和校务委员会的关系：校长是校务委员会的主席，是校务委员会的集体成员之一，对校务委员会的决定要负责贯彻执行。对于执行中发生的重要问题，应向校务委员会做报告。这是集体领导和个人作用的统一。
      如果上述各方面的问题，能求得进一步解决，我想就会大大有利于党委领导下的校务委员会负责制真正发挥作用，也就会使党的领导水平不断提高，使党的领导地位日益巩固。
