    Ancient Artifacts Reborn

    This reporter recently visited the Shanghai cultural relics preservation department and heard many stories about the rebirth of ancient artifacts and their preservation. It's surprising how these precious historical relics have such winding histories in their transmission!

    Preventing Imperialist Theft
    The Shanghai Museum has dozens of ancient painted pottery vessels, which were stolen by the imperialist element Andersson (a Swede) before the liberation. They were about to be shipped abroad when the People's Liberation Army swiftly liberated Shanghai and rescued them from the hands of the imperialists. These painted pottery pieces include world-renowned products of the Yangshao culture from Gansu, precious objects for studying the history of the Neolithic Age. But before liberation, Andersson of Sweden, Stein of Britain, Pelliot of France, and many other imperialist elements, colluded with the Kuomintang reactionaries and stole countless precious cultural relics from our country. They cut down the famous Dunhuang murals piece by piece and smuggled them out. They chiseled the exquisite Tang Dynasty "Six Steeds of Zhao Mausoleum" from the stone wall and robbed two of them. They even dismantled the main hall of a princely residence in Beijing and the caisson ceiling of the Zhihua Temple's Wanfo Pavilion and installed them in American museums. The Museum of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (i.e., the British "Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland"), which was stationed in Shanghai for a long time, even investigated the distribution of various cultural relics in our country under the name of a museum, plundering important cultural relics and specimens from our country. As early as 1928 and 1931, they went to Sichuan, Tibet, and other places in our country to search for resources, made the world's most precious animal, the panda, into a specimen, and shipped it abroad along with other cultural relics.

    After 1949, these imperialist elements were driven out by the Chinese people. But they were not reconciled. After liberation, they colluded with a small group of unscrupulous smugglers and wanted to continue stealing our treasures. Although they used suitcases with false bottoms for secret packing and disguised the cultural relics by smearing them with colored flour to deceive people, they could not escape the customs' identification in the end. The Shanghai antique dealers known as the "Four Golden Swords," who specialized in selling cultural relics, were successively investigated and dealt with after liberation. A large number of long-missing historical relics such as bronzes, porcelains, books, and paintings were also found in their secret rooms. One of them was a huge bronze mirror made in the Tang Dynasty using the "gold and silver inlaying technique," with a diameter of 36.2 centimeters. The flying people, flying phoenixes, and flying butterflies inlaid with gold and silver on the mirror are vivid and lively, making it an extremely exquisite work of art and craft.

    Changing from One Person's Viewing to Ten Thousand People's Appreciation
    Many of the precious cultural relics now displayed in museums were still privately collected a few years ago. Since liberation, inspired by the Party's policy of protecting cultural relics, many people have successively donated a large number of collected treasures to the state. The Ministry of Culture has issued nine certificates of merit to reward Shanghai collectors for their donations. The two famous artifacts of the Zhou Dynasty donated by Pan Dayu, the "Da Yu Ding" and the "Da Ke Ding," are not only magnificent in shape and exquisite in workmanship, but also the best fine products in shape and pattern of the early Western Zhou bronze craftsmanship. In particular, the "Da Yu Ding" is engraved with an inscription of 291 characters, which records King Kang of Zhou's speech to the nobleman "Yu" and the reasons for casting the tripod, which provides extremely important information for studying the social economy and political system of the Western Zhou Dynasty. During the Anti-Japanese War, Pan Dayu buried them underground in Suzhou to prevent them from being plundered by the Japanese imperialists. After liberation, inspired by the Party's policy of protecting cultural relics, he resolutely and unconditionally dedicated these two beloved ancient objects to the state.

    The owner of "Guoyunlou," who had treasured calligraphy, paintings, and rubbings for generations, always preferred to endure difficult living conditions from the Anti-Japanese War to before liberation, rather than let a single piece of calligraphy, painting, or rubbing be transmitted to the imperialist elements. In March of this year, the 64-year-old Mrs. Shen Tongyue donated all the treasures collected in "Shuyunlou" to the state. This old lady said well when she donated: "Donating to the state so that everyone can appreciate them is more meaningful than one person locking themselves up to look at them."

    I also heard many stories here about picking up valuable ancient objects from scrap copper and rotten iron and from piles of old paper. The Shanghai cultural relics preservation department has found many historical relics and revolutionary cultural relics at Shanghai smelting plants, waste product company collection stations, and other places. The Gui vessel made by the ingenious craftsman "Xian" of the Wei State of the Western Zhou Dynasty, the Liang Qi Zhong, the Xi Zhong Zhong, and the bird-pattern sacrificial zun of the Shang Dynasty, which are vivid in shape and exquisite in pattern, were all found in waste piles. There is also a "Sanxia Tongzhi" that has never been recorded in past books, a water conservancy work from the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. This unique book, which is very valuable for reference in water conservancy projects, was picked up from a waste product processing station organized by deaf-mutes. Other famous items, such as the "Lin Gui Lid," were found by a 17-year-old boy, Shi Guoqing.

    Careful Repair
    It is a very interesting artistic labor to find ways to repair ancient cultural relics that have been damaged, and some can even be restored so vividly that they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The Shanghai Museum has several lacquerware pieces from the Warring States period. Because of their age, the wooden cores of the lacquerware have shrunk and cracked, and the raw lacquer applied to them has been wrinkled and unbearable. In order to prevent further erosion, they can only be preserved by immersing them in water and cannot be displayed in the hall. The staff of the Shanghai Museum found a way to peel off the thin layer of lacquer and re-stick it on a plastic core, which not only maintained the original shape but also did not damage any of the patterns. Two pieces, a lacquer box and a lacquer plate, have now been successfully restored and are on public display in the hall. Another piece is a bronze vessel from the Shang Dynasty, the sacrificial head with hundreds of nipples and thunder pattern Lei. This is one of the rare and precious cultural relics in the country, but when it was picked up from the scrap copper pile of the Shanghai Smelting Plant, there were only 22 fragments, and piecing them together only amounted to slightly more than half of the original. The old worker who restored the ancient object glued and repaired it to its original shape. Now it is placed in the exhibition, and without someone pointing it out, it is almost impossible to see that it was repaired from fragments.

    After liberation, museums across the country supported each other and transferred cultural relics according to needs. In recent years, Shanghai has transported various historical relics to provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. Recently, another batch of fine products has been selected and transported to Beijing, ready to be exhibited in the National Museum of Chinese History. In addition to the Da Yu Ding of the Western Zhou Dynasty and the gold and silver inlaid feather-man flying phoenix flower-and-bird mirror of the Tang Dynasty, there are also the Bu gui lid of the Western Zhou Dynasty with long inscriptions engraved on it, and the existing earliest and most famous silverware, the Gan You silver cup of the Warring States period, and more than 70 other pieces.

    古物新生
    陆左华文　张萍摄影
    记者最近访问了上海文物保管部门，听到了许多古物新生和文物保管的故事。想不到那些历史的珍贵文物，在流传中都有一段曲折的历史呢！
    不让帝国主义偷盗
    上海博物馆保存的好几十种古老的彩陶器皿，在解放前夕已被帝国主义分子安特生（瑞典人）盗去，即将运往国外，亏得我人民解放军迅速解放了上海，才把它们从帝国主义分子手里拯救出来。这些彩陶中包括有世界闻名的甘肃仰韶文化的产品，这是研究新石器时代历史的珍物。可是在解放前，瑞典的安特生、英国的斯坦因、法国的伯希以及许多帝国主义分子，勾结国民党反动派，从我国盗走了无数的珍贵文物。他们把著名的敦煌壁画一块一块地挖下来，盗运出去，他们把精美绝伦的唐代“昭陵六骏”从石壁上凿下二骏劫走，甚至把北京一座王府的大殿和智化寺万佛阁的藻井也拆走，安装在美国的博物馆里。长期驻留在上海的亚洲文会（即英国伦敦“大英亚洲文会”华北支会）博物馆，还以博物馆的名义调查我国各种文物分布情况，掠夺我国重要文物和标本。早在1928年、1931年，他们就到我国四川、西藏等地找寻资源，把世界上最珍贵的动物熊猫制成标本，连同其他文物一起运往国外。
    1949年后，这些帝国主义分子给中国人民赶跑了。可是他们并不甘心，解放以后，他们勾结一小撮丧尽天良的走私犯，还想继续盗窃我国的瑰宝。尽管他们用夹底皮箱偷装，在文物上涂抹颜色面粉伪装蒙混，但是终于逃避不了海关的鉴别。专门盗卖文物的上海古玩商“四大金剑”，在解放以后相继被查获，在他们的密室里还搜查出大批失踪已久的铜器、瓷器、书、画等历史文物。其中有一件是唐代用“金银平脱法”制造的巨大铜镜，直径长有三十六点二公分，镜上用金银镶嵌的飞人、飞凤、飞蝶，生动活泼，是一件极为精美的工艺美术品。
    变一人看为万人赏
    现在陈列在博物馆里的许多珍贵的文物，几年前还是由私人所收藏的。解放以来，在党的保护文物政策感召下，陆续有人把大批收藏的珍品献给了国家。文化部为奖励上海的收藏家的捐献，已颁发了九张奖状。潘达于所捐献的周代“大盂鼎”、“大克鼎”两件名器，不仅形制宏伟，制作精美，是西周初期青铜工艺中形制和花纹最好的精品，尤其是“大盂鼎”上刻有铭文二百九十一字，记载了周康王对贵族“盂”的讲话以及铸鼎的原因，对研究西周社会经济和政治制度提供了极重要的资料。抗日战争时期，潘达于为了防止日本帝国主义者掠夺，在苏州掘地埋藏，到解放后他在党的保护文物政策感召下，毅然把这两件心爱的古物无偿地献给了国家。
    世代珍藏书画碑帖的“过云楼”主人，从抗日战争到解放以前，总是宁愿熬着生活困难，没有让一张书画碑帖流传给帝国主义分子。今年3月，这位六十四岁的老太太沈同樾把“述云楼”全部所藏的珍品献给了国家。这位老太太在捐献时说得好：捐献给国家人人可以欣赏，比一个人关起门来看有意义得多了”。
    从废铜烂铁中，从旧纸堆中捡出名贵古物的故事，我也在这里听到了很多。上海文物保管部门在上海冶炼、废品公司的收购站等处找出了许多历史文物和革命文物。西周魏国巧匠“贤”所制的簋和梁其钟、兮仲钟以及造型生动、花纹精细的商代鸟纹牺尊等珍品，都是在废品堆中找出来的。还有一部过去著录中从来没有记载过的“三峡通志”，是明代万历年间的水利著作。这本对水利工程很有参考价值的绝本，却是从一个聋哑人组织的废品加工站中捡到的。其他如有名的“蔺簋盖”是由一个十七岁的孩子施国庆捡获的。
    精心修补
    古代文物遭到毁坏，能够设法修补，有的还能修复得维妙维肖，几可乱真，这是一项很有趣的艺术劳动。上海博物馆收藏的有几件战国时代的漆器，因为年代已久，漆器的木胎已干缩而迸裂，上面所敷的生漆已经折皱不堪；为了防免继续剥蚀，只能浸在水中加以保存，无法放在大厅里展出。上海博物馆的工作人员设法把薄薄的敷漆剥落下来，重贴在塑料胎上，既保持了原来的形制，而且不损一点花纹，现在已有两件——漆奁，和漆盘修复成功，陈列在大厅里公开展出了。另外一件是铜器——商代的牺首百乳雷纹罍，这是国内很少见的珍贵文物之一，可是从上海冶炼厂的废铜堆中拣到时，只有二十二张碎片了，拚凑起来只及原物的大半。修复古物的老工人却把它胶合和修补成了原样，现在放在展览会里，没人指点，简直看不出是用碎片修补起来的。
    解放以后全国的博物馆都相互支援，根据需要调拨文物。几年来，上海已为全国各省、市和自治区运出了各种各样的历史文物。最近又选出了一批精品运往北京，准备在中国历史博物馆内展出，其中除有西周的大盂鼎、唐代的金银平脱羽人飞凤花鸟镜以外，还有刻着长篇铭文的西周不?簋盖、现存最早而最著名的银器战国甘游银杯等七十多件。
