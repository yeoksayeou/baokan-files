Glossary of Terms

    Orogenic Movement: Due to the internal forces of the earth's crust, the earth's crust is constantly in motion. The movement of the earth's crust is diverse, but basically can be divided into two types: epeirogenic movement and orogenic movement. Epeirogenic movement is slower, it is the rising or falling movement of the stable parts of the earth's crust, and sometimes it also fractures the strata, but not violently. Orogenic movement is more intense, it is the left-right movement of the stable parts of the earth's crust, generally very intense, causing various changes in the strata, and can even be reversed. The two are also interconnected. There have been many orogenic movements in earth's history. Previous orogenic movements have mostly been leveled or turned into low hills due to the passage of time. New orogenic movements have made mountains such as the Himalayas become high mountains. Most of China's major mountains are related to new orogenic movements or have been affected by new orogenic movements.

    Proterozoic Eon: The entire history of the Earth has been very long. For the convenience of research, it is divided into several eras, each era is divided into several periods, each period is divided into several epochs, and each epoch is divided into several stages. Before the Proterozoic Eon, there was the Archean Eon, and after it, there were the Paleozoic Era, the Mesozoic Era, and the Cenozoic Era.

    Cambrian Period: In the history of the Earth, the Paleozoic Era is divided into six periods, and the Cambrian Period is the first of these. After the Cambrian Period, there are also the Ordovician Period, the Silurian Period, the Devonian Period, the Carboniferous Period, and the Permian Period. The Cambrian Period lasted for about 80 million years.

    Triassic Period: The Mesozoic Era is divided into three periods, and the Triassic Period is the first of these. After the Triassic Period, there are also the Jurassic Period and the Cretaceous Period. The Triassic Period lasted for about 35 million years.

    Shiqianfeng Formation: In regional geology, a place name is often used to represent the strata formed during a certain period of an era. The Shiqianfeng Formation is named after a mountain in the western mountains of Taiyuan, Shanxi. Its geological age is often debated, and it is generally regarded as a deposit from the end of the Paleozoic Era to the beginning of the Mesozoic Era.

    名词解释
    造山运动：由于地壳的内力作用，地壳时时在运动中。地壳的运动是多种多样的，但基本上可以分为造陆运动和造山运动两种。造陆运动较缓慢，是地壳的稳定部分的上升或下降运动，对地层也有时起断折作用，但不剧烈。造山运动较剧烈，是地壳稳定部分的左右运动，一般的很剧烈，使地层起各种变动，甚至可以倒转过来。两者又是互相连系的。地史上有多次的造山运动，以前的造山运动，多因时间悠久夷为平地或低的山丘。新的造山运动，使如喜马拉雅山等成为高山。我国的主要高山，大多数和新的造山运动有关，或受了新的造山运动的影响。
    元古代：地球的全部历史，经过的时间很长，为了便于研究，把它分为若干代，每代分为若干纪，每纪分为若干世，每世分为若干期。在元古代之前有太古代，之后有古生代、中生代、新生代。
    寒武纪：在地球的历史中，古生代共分六个纪，寒武纪是其中的第一个纪。寒武纪之后还有奥陶纪、志留纪、泥盆纪、石炭纪、二叠纪。寒武纪延长约八千万年。
    三叠纪：中生代共分三个纪，三叠纪是其中的第一个纪。三叠纪之后，还有侏罗纪和白垩纪。三叠纪延续约三千五百万年。
    石千峰统：在区域地质上，经常用一地名代表一个纪的某一时期所造成的地层。石千峰统就是根据山西太原西山的一个山头命名的。它的地质年代，经常有争论，一般当作古生代末到中生代初的堆积。
