To Determine Management Methods Based on Seedling Conditions
Fengxi Commune Cadres Go Deep into the Fields to Study Problems Such as Rice Lodging Prevention

Our newspaper Guangzhou, 7th. The Fengxi People's Commune in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, recently held an on-site meeting in the Yunying Production Brigade. Cadres went deep into the fields and, together with the masses, "dissected the sparrow," effectively solving various ideological and practical problems in the late-stage field management of early rice. Now, all twenty-nine production brigades in the commune are continuing to exert their efforts, concentrating their strength to do a good job in preventing lodging and controlling pests and diseases, and carrying out early rice field management to the end, striving for a bumper harvest of early rice.

Of the Fengxi Commune's more than 21,000 mu of early rice, 80% is currently heading and flowering, of which about 40% has already emerged and is filling. Except for a portion of japonica rice and direct-seeding fields, the seedlings are growing better than last year, and a good harvest is in sight. However, 1,945 mu of rice leaves are too dark green, posing a risk of lodging. In addition, 820 mu have been infected with rice blast, of which 109 mu are more severely affected, with the bacteria having spread from the rice leaves to the panicle neck. In order to solve these problems, the commune organized the branch secretaries, brigade leaders, and experienced farmers of seventy-three production brigades to go to the fields of the Yunying Brigade to jointly "dissect the sparrow," to see what the actual condition of the seedlings was, in order to find countermeasures.

The seedlings of the Yunying Brigade are representative of the entire commune. Of the brigade's 242 mu of paddy fields, 121 mu have already developed rice blast. After checking the fields one by one, the representatives at the meeting believed that the current disease was still relatively mild. Apart from 31 mu with panicle neck infections, only some rice leaves had developed lesions in the remaining 90 mu. Judging from past experience, the current disease can be completely prevented and controlled. The method is to spray Cereasan mixed with 1% 666 powder on the fields with panicle neck infections to kill the bacteria; then spray lime sulfur solution three or four times a week to prevent the recurrence of old diseases. For fields where panicle neck disease has not been found, lime sulfur solution should be sprayed comprehensively to prevent the bacteria from spreading from the rice leaves to the panicle neck.

From the "dissection" of the Yunying Brigade's seedlings, the representatives at the meeting agreed that preventing lodging is a complex and arduous task in the late-stage field management of rice. The current seedlings are roughly in three situations, and three management methods can be adopted: (1) For fields in higher terrain, where drainage has been carried out more thoroughly in the early stage, and the rice is now heading and flowering, water can be boldly irrigated to fully supply the nutrients needed by the seedlings during heading and grain filling, and promote full grain setting. (2) Low-lying fields should be drained and the fields dried to prevent lodging and rotting; but also take into account the water needed for rice heading and flowering, and continue to irrigate after the soil in the field has hardened. (3) For fields with excessively dark green leaves and a risk of lodging, drainage and sun drying must be resolutely carried out to make the soil in the center of the field dry and hard; if the soil in the center of the field is not dry, but the surrounding area is suffering from drought, then the center of the field can be sun-dried while the surrounding area is watered.

After the on-site meeting, each production brigade also followed this practice to conduct inspections in the team and take specific measures, acting immediately. In the past three days, the 820 mu of fields with rice blast in all 29 brigades in the commune have been sprayed with pesticides once, and another 290 mu of fields that may develop rice blast have also been sprayed with lime sulfur solution once.

    看禾苗情况　定管理办法
    枫溪公社干部深入田间，研究水稻防倒伏等问题
    本报广州7日电　广东省潮安县枫溪人民公社最近在云英生产大队召开现场会议，干部深入田间，同群众一起“解剖麻雀”，切实而有力地解决了早稻后期田间管理当中的各种思想问题和实际问题。现在，全社二十九个生产大队，正在继续鼓足干劲，集中力量做好预防倒伏和防治病虫害工作，把早稻田间管理抓到底，力争早稻大丰收。
    枫溪公社的二万一千多亩早稻，目前80％正在抽穗扬花，其中有40％左右已经出穗灌浆。除掉一部分粳稻和直播田以外，其它的禾苗生势都比去年好，丰收在望。但是，有一千九百四十五亩稻叶过于浓绿，有倒伏的危险。另外，有八百二十亩已经染上了稻热病，其中比较严重的一百零九亩，病菌已从禾叶侵袭到穗颈。为了解决这些问题，公社组织了七十三个生产大队的支部书记、大队长和有经验的农民，到云英大队的田头，共同“解剖麻雀”，看看禾苗的实在情况怎么样，以寻找对策。
    云英大队的禾苗，在全社是有代表性的。这个大队的二百四十二亩稻田中，有一百二十一亩已经发生稻热病。到会代表逐丘检查后，认为目前病情还比较轻微，除了三十一亩穗颈部分发病以外，其余九十亩只有部分稻叶发生了病斑。从历年经验来看，目前病情完全可以防治。办法是：对穗颈发病的田喷射赛力生加1％的六六六粉，扑灭病菌；以后每星期再喷射三、四次硫磺石灰水，防止旧病复发。对于未发现穗颈病的田，要全面喷射硫磺石灰水，预防病菌从禾叶蔓延到穗颈。
    从对云英大队禾苗的“解剖”中，到会代表都认为防止倒伏是水稻后期田间管理中一个复杂而艰巨的工作。目前的禾苗大致有三种情况，可以采取三种管理办法：（1）地势较高的田，前段排水工作做得比较彻底，目前水稻又在抽穗扬花，可以大胆灌水，以便充分供应禾苗抽穗灌浆时所需要的养分，促进结粒饱满。（2）低洼田，要放手排水晒田，防倒防烂；但也要照顾到水稻抽穗扬花所需的水分，在田土晒硬后，还要继续灌水。（3）禾叶过度浓绿、有倒伏危险的田，要坚决排水晒田，使田中央土块干硬；如果田中央土块未干，而田四周却受旱，就可以一边让田中央晒田，一边在田的四周浇水。
    现场会议结束后，各个生产大队也仿照这种做法在队里进行检查，采取具体措施，马上行动。三天来，全社二十九个大队八百二十亩发生稻热病的田已全面喷射了一次药剂，另外二百九十亩可能发生稻热病的田也喷了一次硫磺石灰水。　（丁岗）
