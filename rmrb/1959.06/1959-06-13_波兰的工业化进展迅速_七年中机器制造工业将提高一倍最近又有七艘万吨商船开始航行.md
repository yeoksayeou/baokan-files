Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, Electric Dispatch: Poland is rapidly developing its machine manufacturing industry. By 1965, machine production will double compared to 1958, equivalent to forty times the pre-war level.

The development speed of Poland's machine manufacturing industry is faster than any other industrial sector. Before the war, the output value of machine manufacturing accounted for only 7% of the total national economic output. Currently, it accounts for 20% of the entire national economy, an increase of more than sixteen times compared to pre-war levels. By 1965, this proportion will reach 24%.

While vigorously developing the machine manufacturing industry, the state has also established a series of new machine manufacturing sectors and produced many new products that Poland has never had before. Currently, Poland can produce more than 300 types of lathes, including large metal-cutting lathes and universal automatic lathes. In 1959 alone, Poland will undertake the design of fifty-five new types of lathes and the production of fifty prototypes.

In order to meet the needs of vigorously developing the power industry and chemical industry, Poland is mass-producing electric motors, turbo-generators, and chemical industry machinery, and has begun producing 120,000-kilowatt combined units, transformers, and expanding the production of machinery for manufacturing synthetic fibers and artificial fertilizers. It is estimated that by 1965, the output of turbo-generators alone will be ten times the current level.

Poland currently exports machinery and equipment to sixty countries. Machine exports account for 28% of Poland's export volume, and by 1965, this proportion will increase to 38%, ranking first in Poland's total export volume.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 12th: Poland's maritime transport industry is developing extremely rapidly. Recently, seven more merchant ships, each with a deadweight of 10,000 tons, have begun sailing. This year, three more merchant ships of the same deadweight and an oil tanker will be launched. Currently, Polish seagoing vessels travel to ports in forty countries.

Poland's marine transportation provides the country with a large amount of foreign exchange. In 1958 alone, the country earned 619 million zlotys. In that year, Poland's maritime transport volume reached 1.6 million tons, of which 70% was Polish cargo, 15% came from the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Hungary, and 15% came from capitalist countries.

Polish shipyards are building larger ships. Currently, the Gdansk Shipyard is manufacturing oil tankers with a capacity of 18,500 tons for the Polish marine fleet, and this shipyard will soon launch the first 40,000-ton ship. This is a new crane with a lifting capacity of 40 tons newly installed at the Gdansk Shipyard in Poland. The Polish 10,000-ton ship "Nowotko" is docked in the port of Gdansk.

    波兰的工业化进展迅速
    七年中机器制造工业将提高一倍最近又有七艘万吨商船开始航行
    新华社华沙电　波兰正在迅速发展机器制造工业，到1965年，机器生产将比1958年提高一倍，相当于战前的四十倍。
    波兰机器制造工业的发展速度比其他任何工业部门都要快。在战前，机器制造业产值只占国民经济总产值的7％。目前，占全部国民经济的20％，比战前增长了十六倍以上，到1965年，比重将达到24％。
    在大力发展机器制造工业的同时，国家还建立了一系列的新的机器制造业部门，而且生产出许多种波兰从未有过的新产品。目前，波兰能够生产三百种以上的车床，其中包括大型金属切削车床和万能自动车床等。仅在1959年，波兰将进行五十五种新型车床的设计工作和生产五十种样机。
    为了适应大力发展电力工业和化学工业的需要，波兰正在大量生产电动机、涡轮发电机和化学工业机器，并且开始生产十二万瓩的联合机组、变压器和扩大生产制造合成纤维和人造肥料的机器。据估计到1965年，仅涡轮发电机的产量就将为目前的十倍。
    波兰目前向六十个国家出口机器和设备。机器出口占波兰出口额的28％，到1965年，这一比例将提高到38％，而占波兰总出口额的首位。
    新华社华沙12日电　波兰的海运事业发展极为迅速。最近，又有七艘各载重一万吨的商船开始航行。今年，还将有三艘同样载重量的商船和一艘油船下水。目前，波兰的海船往来于四十个国家的港口。
    波兰的海洋运输给国家提供了大量的外汇。仅1958年国家就收入了六亿一千九百万兹罗提。这一年，波兰的海运量达到了一百六十万吨，其中70％是波兰货物，15％来自德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、苏联和匈牙利，15％来自资本主义国家。
    波兰的造船厂正在制造更大的轮船。目前，革但斯克造船厂正为波兰海洋船队制造容量为一万八千五百吨的油船，这家造船厂不久就要把第一艘四万吨的轮船下水。这是波兰革但斯克造船厂新设置的起重能力为40吨的起重机波兰的万吨轮船“诺沃特科号”停泊在革但斯克港内
