    Green peaches redden their mouths, crowding the trees,
    Ripe apricots fall in piles,
    Who cares?
    Threshing wheat keeps us feverishly busy.
    The people on the threshing ground line up,
    Like a dragon wagging its tail,
    Flails fall, scattering pearls,
    Flails rise, like orioles in flight.
    Threshing field after field,
    Each field a treasure of jewels bumping against our legs,
    Threshing fields like these, ah,
    How delightful:
    Looking at the gold and silver piles before our eyes,
    Everyone's mouth is split in a grin,
    The heat on our bodies, ah,
    What need for a gentle breeze to blow it away!

    打麦歌
    严阵满树青桃红了嘴，
    熟透了的杏子落成堆，
    谁去理会？
    打麦忙得火烧眉。
    场上的人儿排成了队，
    好似龙摆尾，
    ?耞落地珍珠滚，
    ?耞起似莺乱飞。
    打了一场一场又一场，
    场场珠宝乱碰腿，
    打这样的场呵，
    多有滋味：
    看着眼前的金堆银堆，
    人人都笑歪了嘴，
    身上的暑热呵，
    何用轻风来吹！
