    Chicken Raising Expert Chen Xiaocai
    By Our Correspondent Lu Liang
    In mid-May of this year, I happened to hear about this: in Dongchen Production Team of Changan Commune, Haining County, Zhejiang Province, there is a woman named Chen Xiaocai. She raises 128 chickens, 17 rabbits, and 3 sheep, all the feed for which she provides herself. At the same time, she also participates in the team's labor and takes care of the life of her family of seven.
    This made me very excited. One warm and sunny afternoon, we made a special trip to visit Chen Xiaocai. In front of her house was the farm, with a fence surrounding the area planted with fruit trees. The chickens were foraging under the trees.
    Chen Xiaocai started raising chickens in 1951. Once, she bought a pair of four-tael European breed chickens from the Qinghua Farm in Shanghai. After nine months, they grew to ten and a half jin. Later, she successively bought "Luhua Leke," "Laikeheng" ... In this way, slowly breeding them, it became the situation it is now.
    She raises so many chickens, how does she solve the feed problem?
    "As long as you think of a way, are diligent, there is plenty of feed." As Chen Xiaocai spoke, she stared at us with her two round eyes, appearing very opinionated and full of ideas. Then, we suggested that she take us to see the farm.
    We stopped next to the fruit trees on the farm. Chen Xiaocai pointed to the fruit trees and said: "Planting these peach trees, plum trees, and orange trees is of great benefit to raising chickens. The fruit trees provide shade, giving the chickens a place to cool off; the trees inevitably produce insects, which fall on the ground. The chickens peck at the grass and eat the insects, and their droppings become good fertilizer for the fruit trees. This is called chicken fertilizes fruit, and fruit fertilizes chicken, killing two birds with one stone."
    Then, she took us to an open space. "This is barren land that doesn't grow crops, but it can grow insects. The method is to dig a ditch, put some garbage at the bottom, put some lime on top, and then cover it with soil. In a few days, there will be many insects."
    As she said this, she quickly took a small hoe from the edge of the wall and turned the soil in the ditch. With just a few strokes, a large number of insects were dug out.
    "Comrade, you see how many insects there are!" As she said this, before she could call them, all the big and small chickens rushed to the edge of the ditch, snatching and grabbing, creating quite a lively scene.
    Over the years, Chen Xiaocai has accumulated a set of feeding methods based on her own practice. Taking feeding the chickens as an example, she insisted on the method of fixed time, fixed amount, and feeding small amounts frequently. Large chickens are fed three times a day, and small chickens are fed eight times a day, paying attention to the nutritional balance of the chicken feed, especially valuing the feed for small chickens. Small chickens are generally fed green grass or green vegetables mixed with bran, or fried rice flour mixed with shallots. She said that this is not only nutritious but also makes the small chickens able to digest and also strengthens the stomach, preventing the small chickens from getting dysentery. She also pays attention to the water the chickens drink. She never gives small chickens and laying hens raw water or dirty (alkaline) water used for washing clothes.
    Chen Xiaocai was still talking when a seven or eight jin hen swayed over, jumped onto the threshold, and squatted there motionless. It seemed that it was full and needed to rest. We continued to ask Chen Xiaocai: What if the chickens get sick? She smiled and said:
    "I haven't encountered that for a long time. Speaking of it, it was something that happened before: Last spring, a "Laikeheng" got a plague. At that time, the chicken's comb turned purple, the feathers on its wings fell off, it passed clear urine, and it clucked non-stop. Sometimes it would just stand there blankly, shrinking its neck. I gave it a green mold tablet in three doses along with a soda tablet. By the next day, the chicken was better.
    "Generally, if small chickens get sick, feeding them a Xiaozhilong tablet can also cure them."
    She told many examples of treating chickens. In her experience, what is especially important is that when a sick chicken is first discovered, it must be immediately isolated, and the chicken coop must be disinfected.
    In our imagination, it is really amazing that an uneducated woman can be familiar with and master poultry-raising knowledge and also be able to treat chickens. So, we asked her how she obtained this knowledge. She told us that there was such a story:
    Three years ago, once the chickens she raised got "white dysentery," which spread quickly. The sick chickens all became dull and thin, making Chen Xiaocai anxious. She was determined to find a way to save them. She remembered that people took Xiaozhilong tablets plus soda tablets when they had a fever. From this, she concluded that Xiaozhilong could also cure chicken diseases. So she asked someone to buy books about raising chickens in Shanghai, and also bought Xiaozhilong, green mold tablets, and other medicines. Her fourteen-year-old daughter, Zhu Sibao, read the chicken-raising books to her. In this way, she slowly understood: how to treat sick chickens, how to raise chickens well, how to get them to lay more eggs, how to manage the chicks well, what can be used as feed ... and so on, a whole set of knowledge.
    Chen Xiaocai's home also raises fifteen pigs, seventeen rabbits, three sheep, and ducks...
    At first, we all doubted this. I said to Chen Xiaocai: "You raise chickens, and also raise pigs, sheep, ducks, and rabbits, and also participate in production and take care of the children, do you have time?"
    She said confidently: "As long as it is arranged well, there is still plenty of time." According to her experience, the feed must be prepared in advance. Her daily work is very orderly. In the morning, she gets up before dawn to cook pig food, first feeds the pigs. When the sun comes out, she opens the cage to release the chickens and ducks. After feeding them, she checks the sheepfold and rabbit hutch along the way, and feeds the sheep and rabbits. After everything is busy, she eats breakfast herself, and then goes to the production team to participate in agricultural labor. After lunch, she checks and adds feed again, and then goes out to work, bringing back cut grass or caught insects when she returns.
    In this way, she earned more than 1,500 work points in the production team last year. After the autumn harvest, she was named an advanced worker in the commune.
    Our conversation turned to the issue of income from raising chickens and pigs.
    Chen Xiaocai said: "Developing sideline production is a big income. I just take a little sporadic time to busy myself, cut some grass, catch some insects, and there is feed. And the annual income is more than three thousand yuan. You see: what a big income this is!"
    As we were about to end the conversation, Chen Xiaocai said with a smile: "This year we have already hatched twenty-four nests of chicks, a total of seven hundred and four. By the end of the year, these chicks will also lay eggs. My plan for next year is to raise ten thousand chickens!"
    On the way back, the local cadres also told us that in early April of this year, in order to make the development of livestock and poultry in the production team faster, Chen Xiaocai automatically took out 775 chickens and 45 ducks, both large and small, and distributed them to 172 commune members to raise. Therefore, under the influence and promotion of Chen Xiaocai, this twenty-eight-household production team raised an average of nineteen chickens per household this year. Now, they have also made a plan: to raise seventy-four chickens and ducks per household before the National Day in October. The commune members all praised Chen Xiaocai as a "chicken-raising expert" and the "top scholar among breeders."

### 养鸡能手陈小采

    养鸡能手陈小采
    本报记者  卢良
    今年5月中旬，偶然听到这样一件事：浙江海宁县长安公社东陈生产队，有一位妇女陈小采，她养了一百二十八只鸡、十七只兔、三只羊，全部饲料由自己解决，同时还参加了队里的劳动和照料全家七口人的生活。
    这件事使我很兴奋，在一个风和日暖的下午，我们特地去访问了陈小采。她家门前就是饲养场，围着篱笆的场地种了果树，鸡群就在树下觅食。
    陈小采是1951年开始养鸡的。一次，她在上海清华农场买了一对四两重的欧洲种洋鸡，九个多月，就长到十斤半重。以后又陆续买来了“芦花力克”、“来克亨”……这样，慢慢地繁殖起来，就成了现在这个局面。
    她养了这么多鸡，饲料问题是怎样解决的呢？
    “只要想办法，手脚勤快，饲料有的是。”陈小采一面说话，一面用两只溜圆的眼睛盯着我们，显得很有主见，满有办法的样子。接着，我们就提议，请她带我们去看看饲养场。
    我们在饲养场的果树旁边停下来，陈小采指着果树说：“种了这些桃树、李树、桔树，对养鸡有很大的好处。果树成荫，鸡有了纳凉的地方；树上免不了生虫子，虫掉在地上，鸡啄了草又吃了虫，拉下的粪又成了果树的好肥料，这叫做鸡肥果肥，一举两得。”
    接着，她又把我们带到一块空地上。“这是不长庄稼的荒地，可是，它能够长虫子，方法是挖条沟、放些垃圾打底，上面放些石灰，然后将泥土盖住，隔几天虫子就很多了。”
    说到这里，只见她很快地从围墙边拿出一把小锄头，在沟里翻土，锄不几下，大量的虫子就被挖出来了。
    “同志，你看这虫够多吧！”说着，不等她招呼，所有的大鸡小鸡都一起涌到沟边来，抢的抢，夺的夺，好一番热闹。
    几年来陈小采根据自己的实践，积累了一套饲养办法。拿喂鸡食来说，她是坚持了定时定量和少量多喂的办法，大鸡一天喂三次，小鸡喂八次，注意鸡食的营养调配，特别重视小鸡的饲料，给小鸡吃的一般是青草或青菜拌糠，或者是炒米面拌葱。她说，这样不仅营养好，而且使小鸡能消化，还能健胃，防止小鸡得痢疾。鸡吃的水也很注意，她给小鸡和生蛋的母鸡从来不吃生水和洗衣服的污（碱）水。
    陈小采正说着，一只七八斤重的母鸡摇摆着走了过来，跳上门槛，蹲在那里一动不动。看来，它已吃饱了，需要休息。我们又继续问陈小采：如果鸡生了病怎么办？她笑笑说：
    “这件事，长久没有遇到过了。说起来，还是以前的事：去年春天，一只“来克亨”生了瘟病，当时，鸡的冠发紫，翅膀上的羽毛脱落，拉的是清尿，咯咯地叫个不停，有时又呆呆地缩颈不动。我用一粒绿霉素分三次跟苏打片一起塞给它吃，到第二天，鸡的病就好了。
    “一般的小鸡得病，喂一片消治龙也能治好。”
    给鸡医病的事例，她讲了很多，在她的经验里，特别重要的是当开始发现病鸡的时候，要立即隔离开来，鸡舍都要消毒。
    在我们的想像中，一个没有文化的妇女，能熟悉掌握家禽饲养知识，又能给鸡治病，实在是了不起的事。于是，就问起她是怎样获得这些知识的。她告诉我们，有过这样一段故事：
    三年前，一次她养的鸡得了“白痢”，蔓延很快，得病的鸡都呆鼓鼓地瘦削下去，弄得陈小采心焦如焚。她一心要设法救活它们。她想起人发热时吃消治龙药片、外加苏打片。由此，她断定消治龙也能治鸡的病。于是她就托人去上海买了有关养鸡的书，还买了消治龙、绿霉素之类的药回来。养鸡的书由她的十四岁女儿朱四宝读给她听。就这样，她慢慢地懂得了：鸡病了怎么治疗，当时，鸡的“白痢”病也治好了。以后又知道了：怎样养好鸡、怎样多生蛋、小鸡怎样管理好，可以利用那些作饲料……等等整套的知识。
    陈小采的家里，还养了十五只猪、十七只兔、三只羊、还有鸭……
    开始，我们都怀疑过这件事，我对陈小采说：“你养了鸡，又养猪、羊、鸭、兔，还参加生产、照顾孩子，时间允许么？”
    她满有把握地说：“只要安排好，时间还是宽裕的”。按她的经验来说，饲料都要事先准备充足。她每天的工作很有次序，早晨，天不亮就起床烧猪食，先喂猪，太阳出来了，开笼放鸡鸭，喂过以后，顺路检查一下羊圈、兔窝，随手就喂羊、喂兔。一切忙停当以后，自己吃早饭，然后去生产大队参加农业劳动。午饭后，又检查添喂食料一次，然后又出去劳动，回来时割草或捉虫带回来。
    就是这样，她去年全年在生产队里做了一千五百多工分。秋收后，被评上了公社的先进工作者。
    我们的谈话又转到养鸡养猪的收入问题上来了。
    陈小采说：“发展副业生产是一项很大的收入。我只是抽出一点零星时间忙忙搞搞，割点草，捉些虫，饲料就有了。而一年的收入就有三千元以上。你们看：这是多么大的一笔收入啊！”
    当我们将要结束谈话的时候，陈小采笑着说：“今年我们已经孵了二十四窝小鸡，一共七百零四只，到年底这些小鸡也会孵蛋了，我明年的规划要养它一万只鸡哩！”
    在回来的路上，当地的干部，还告诉我们，今年4月初，为了使生产队的家畜家禽发展更快，陈小采自动拿出大小鸡七百七十五只、鸭四十五只分给一百七十二户社员饲养。因此，这个二十八户的生产小队在陈小采的影响和带动下，今年每户平均养了十九只鸡。现在，他们还订出计划：要在十月国庆节以前，每户要养七十四只鸡鸭。社员们都夸奖陈小采是“养鸡能手”，是“饲养员中的状元”。
