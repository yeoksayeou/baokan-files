    From Downstream to Upstream
    One Sunday afternoon, I passed by the student dormitory building 32 of Tianjin University. A chemical engineering student who was standing on the windowsill cleaning the glass invited me to come in and see their achievements in the general cleaning. I entered room 123, and it was truly: bright windows, clean surfaces, and a refreshing atmosphere.
    Not long ago, during the school's evaluation of cleanliness and hygiene, the Department of Chemical Engineering received the "First Place in Hygiene Work" award banner.
    The acquisition of this award banner also has an interesting little episode. Last autumn, when the school's Patriotic Health Campaign Committee inspected cleanliness and hygiene, the results for Building 33 of the Chemical Engineering Department were very poor. This "shocked" everyone in the department. The department's Party and Communist Youth League general branches and administrative leaders immediately convened a meeting of cadres, and the students also launched a debate. Through the debate, everyone realized that eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene was a patriotic action to change customs, so the entire department's hygiene work was carried out enthusiastically. They formed a Department Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and the department director and Party branch secretary also participated in the cleanliness and hygiene work. Teachers and students also formulated a set of practical and feasible hygiene work systems. Each class also established inspection teams, taking a variety of inspection and evaluation methods to ensure the regularity of cleaning and hygiene work. Due to months of persistent patriotic health work, everyone has now developed good habits of paying attention to hygiene and loving cleanliness. All of the more than 300 rooms in the student dormitory have received the small red flags awarded by the department for being clean and tidy. (Hong Minsheng)

    从下游到上游
    一个星期天的下午，我路过天津大学的学生宿舍三十二楼。站在窗台上擦玻璃的一位化工系学生，邀请我进去看看她们大扫除的成绩。我走进了一百二十三室，真个是：窗明几净，气息清新。
    不久前，全校清洁卫生工作评比时，化工系得到了“卫生工作第一名”的奖旗。
    这面奖旗的获得，还有一段有趣的小插曲。去年秋季，学校爱国卫生运动委员会检查清洁卫生的时候，化工系学生宿舍三十三楼成绩很不好。这一下，可把全系的人“震动”了。系党、团总支和行政领导立即召开了干部会议，学生们也纷纷展开辩论。经过辩论，大家认识到除四害讲卫生是移风易俗的爱国行动，于是全系的卫生工作，就热火地搞开了。他们组成了系的爱国卫生运动委员会，系主任和党支部书记也都参加了清洁卫生工作。师生们还制订了一套切实可行的卫生工作制度。各班级也成立了检查组，采取多种多样的检查评比方法，来保证清洁卫生工作的经常化。由于几个月来坚持爱国卫生工作，现在大家已养成了讲卫生爱清洁的好习惯，学生宿舍三百多个房间，曾经全部获得系会奖给的整洁小红旗。（洪敏生）
