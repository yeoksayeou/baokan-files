(Reported by this newspaper) Under the active cultivation and education of Party organizations at all levels in Qinghai Province, batches of minority cadres with both communist consciousness and competence have grown up.

There are currently more than 6,000 minority cadres in the province, accounting for approximately 11% of all cadres in the province, an increase of twelve times compared to the 480 in the early days of liberation in 1950. These minority cadres include more than a dozen ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Hui, Tu, Salar, Mongolian, Manchu, Kazakh, Dongxiang, Yugu, Korean, Zhuang, and Miao. In various autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties, in addition to the vast majority of cadres at the grassroots level being from minority ethnic groups, there are more than 4,750 minority cadres at the prefectural and county levels, including more than 300 women cadres. Among these minority cadres, more than 600 have served as secretaries of the CPC prefectural and county committees, as well as prefects, county heads, and chiefs of departments and bureaus, among other leading positions.

In the multi-ethnic province of Qinghai, Party and government leading organs at all levels plan to organize two to three groups of minority representatives to visit the capital and other parts of the country each year. At the same time, minority cadres are selected and sent to the Central, Northwest, and provincial ethnic colleges and various professional schools for study.

With the development of various tasks, batches of minority cadres have been successively promoted to leadership positions and assumed more important responsibilities. In 1950, there were only more than 20 minority leading cadres in Qinghai Province, but today this has grown to more than 640. Sangre Gyatso (Tibetan) and Xi Yuanshou (Tu), who were school teachers before liberation, now serve as Director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Education and Deputy Director of the Cultural Bureau, respectively. Daxi Renqing, the current Mongolian Deputy County Head of Dulan County in the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, was just an ordinary herdsman in the early days of liberation.

Because the Party and government leaders at all levels in Qinghai Province have correctly implemented the Party's ethnic policies, many minority leading cadres and Han cadres have cooperated and worked together harmoniously, dedicating themselves to their own ethnic groups conscientiously. Sangre Gyatso (Tibetan), Director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Education, has done a lot of work in ethnic education and ethnic cultural translation in recent years, compiling elementary school textbooks, literacy textbooks, and Tibetan grammar, and also translated six Tibetan-language films such as "Golden Silver Beach" and "Dong Cunrui," and has therefore successively received awards from the Northwest Cultural and Educational Committee and the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China.

### 既有共产主义觉悟　又有办事能力  青海少数民族干部迅速成长

    既有共产主义觉悟　又有办事能力
    青海少数民族干部迅速成长
    本报讯　在青海省各级党组织的积极培养教育下，一批批具有共产主义觉悟和办事能力的少数民族干部已成长起来。
    全省目前已有少数民族干部六千多人，这个数字约占全省各族干部的11％，比解放初期1950年时的四百八十人增加了十二倍。在这些少数民族干部中，包括有藏、回、土、撒拉、蒙、满、哈萨克、东乡、裕固、朝鲜、僮、苗等十几种少数民族。几年来，已有近二千名少数民族干部分别参加了共产党和共青团。在各自治州和自治县，除基层绝大部分是少数民族干部外，州、县级共有少数民族干部四千七百五十多人，其中妇女干部三百多人。在这些少数民族干部中有六百多人分别担任了中共州、县委书记和州、县长以及科、部长等领导工作。
    在多民族的青海省，各级党政领导机关每年都有计划地组织两批到三批少数民族代表到首都和全国各地参观和访问，同时，抽调少数民族干部到中央、西北和本省的民族学院以及各种专业学校去学习。
    随着各项工作的发展，少数民族干部一批批地陆续被提拔到领导岗位上来，担负起更重要的责任。1950年青海省仅有二十多个少数民族领导干部，到今天已发展到六百四十多人。解放前担任学校教员的桑热嘉措（藏族）和席元寿（土族），现分别担任了青海省教育厅厅长和文化局副局长。现任海西蒙藏、哈萨克族自治州都兰县蒙古族副县长达希仁庆，在解放初期还是一个普通牧民。
    由于青海省各级党政领导正确地贯彻了党的民族政策，许多少数民族领导干部和汉族干部合作共事，融洽无间，兢兢业业地为本民族作出了贡献。青海省教育厅厅长桑热嘉措（藏族），几年来在民族教育和民族文化翻译工作上作了不少工作，编译小学、扫盲课本和藏文文法，还翻译了“金银滩”、“董存瑞”等六部藏语电影片，因此先后获得了西北文教委员会和中华人民共和国文化部的奖励。
