(From our reporter in Ganzhou, June 28th) The Gannan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized commerce, agriculture, industry, forestry, transportation, banking, and other departments to actively serve the market in conjunction with their respective business operations, making urban and rural markets more active.

The Gannan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a joint meeting of various departments. Based on the production and business characteristics of each department, they discussed and formulated specific measures to further cooperate with each other and closely coordinate to revitalize the market. During the current summer harvest and summer planting period, the specific arrangements of each department for revitalizing the market are: the commercial department should focus on organizing means of production and livelihood materials to support the summer harvest and summer planting, and do a good job in urban and rural market supply and procurement; the industrial department should actively produce various tools and daily necessities to support the summer harvest and summer planting on the premise of completing its own production tasks; the transportation department should combine the completion of the national key material transportation tasks, and transport various commodities needed for the summer harvest and summer planting to the sales locations in a timely manner; the grain department should focus on doing a good job in grain and oil purchase work, and properly arrange the supply of grain and oil to urban industrial and mining areas.

Under the leadership of the district party committee, various departments in the Gannan district have begun to give play to their enthusiasm for serving the market. For example, when the transportation department was recently unable to allocate boats for a while to transport the firewood stored by the commercial department in the mountainous areas to Ganzhou City, the forestry department took the initiative to propose "wood rafts and bamboo rafts should not be released empty," and transported 70,000 jin of firewood out of the mountains every day to supply the needs of the Ganzhou market. The handicraft industry department in Yudu County found that the supply of some small handicraft daily necessities was temporarily insufficient, and adopted the method of "collecting materials locally, learning and doing at the same time" to organize production. Within a month, they produced 100,000 pieces of handicrafts such as bamboo hats, raincoats, iron pots, and baskets.

    赣南各部门协作配合活跃市场
    本报赣州28日电　中共江西省赣南区委组织商业及农业、工业、林业、运输、银行等部门结合本部门业务积极为市场服务，城乡市场更加活跃。
    中共赣南区委召开各部门联合会议，根据各部门的生产和业务特点，讨论制订了进一步互相协作，紧密配合活跃市场的具体办法。当前夏收夏种期间，各个部门对活跃市场的具体安排是：商业部门以组织生产资料、生活资料支援夏收夏种为中心，做好城乡市场供应和收购工作；工业部门以完成本部门生产任务为前提，积极生产各种工具和生活日用品支援夏收夏种；运输部门结合完成国家重点物资的调运任务，把夏收夏种所需要的各种商品及时运到销售地点；粮食部门以做好粮油征购工作为中心，妥善安排城市工矿区的粮油供应。
    赣南区各个部门开始在区党委的领导下，发挥了为市场服务的积极性。如运输部门最近一时拨不出船只，把商业部门存放在山区的木柴运到赣州市，林业部门便主动提出“木排竹筏不空放”，每天运七万斤木柴出山，供应赣州市场的需要。于都县手工业部门发现一些小手工业日用品一时供应不足，采取“就地取材、边学边做”的办法组织生产。一个月内，他们就生产斗笠、蓑衣、铁锅、箩筐等手工业品十万件。
