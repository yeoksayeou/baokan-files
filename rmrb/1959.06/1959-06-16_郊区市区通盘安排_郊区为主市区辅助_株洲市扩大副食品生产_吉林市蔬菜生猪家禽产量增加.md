    Overall Planning for Suburbs and Urban Areas, with Suburbs as the Main Focus and Urban Areas as a Supplement
    Zhuzhou City Expands Non-Staple Food Production
    Jilin City Increases Vegetable, Hog, and Poultry Output
    (Our Report) Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, has adopted a method of combining urban and rural areas to develop non-staple food production, and has achieved remarkable results.
    Zhuzhou City is one of China's emerging industrial cities. In the early days of liberation, it had only 7,000 people, but now the urban area alone has increased to 220,000. With the construction of factories and enterprises in batches and the continuous increase in the urban population, this has brought considerable pressure on the supply of non-staple foods. In order to solve this problem, the Zhuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China began to mobilize and rely on the masses to vigorously develop non-staple food production in the second half of last year. The Municipal Party Committee also adopted a series of effective measures, first establishing vegetable bases in the suburbs, and drawing a certain amount of labor from the ten people's communes in the suburbs to engage in vegetable production. The planting area of vegetables in the suburbs has now expanded from more than 1,700 mu in the past to more than 16,500 mu, and the variety has increased from more than 60 in the past to more than 100 now. In March of this year, the Municipal Party Committee adopted the measures of "relying on the masses, self-reliance, zoning and planning, and meeting between production and sales" to connect vegetable production with consumption. The content of this measure is that under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the commercial departments organize 30 large factories and nearby communes to sign supply and marketing contracts. The people's communes do not need to go through the commercial departments, but directly supply vegetables according to the needs of factories and mines; other collective catering units are organized by the non-staple food stores in the five districts of the commercial departments to meet production and sales.
    As a result of these measures, Zhuzhou City has achieved self-sufficiency in vegetable production, and in addition to pickling and storing a part, it also transfers a part to support other industrial and mining areas.
    In order to further improve the lives of workers and urban residents and better meet the consumption needs of urban people, the Zhuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has called on factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and other collective units throughout the city to give full play to the potential of urban non-staple food production this year, and to raise pigs and grow vegetables in large quantities, making use of the scattered land in front of and behind houses. At present, 241 collective units in the city have raised more than 8,500 pigs, an average of one pig per 11 people, and planted about 1,000 mu of vegetables, as well as raising poultry and aquatic products. At present, some factories and schools have achieved half self-sufficiency or self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat.
    (Our Report) After implementing the policy of focusing on suburban vegetable production, Jilin City has significantly increased the output of vegetables, hogs, and poultry.
    This year, Jilin City planted more than 5,000 hectares of vegetables in the suburbs, an increase of 30% over last year. Among them, the planting area of ​​spring vegetables was 1,700 hectares, more than double that of last year. Because the planting of spring vegetables was grasped early and tightly, spring vegetables went on the market in late April, about half a month earlier than last year. At present, 300,000 catties of fresh vegetables are on the market every day. In addition to basically ensuring the supply of the city, it also supports Changchun City. In terms of hog raising, it has increased from 27,500 at the end of last year to more than 35,200, an increase of 28%. The number of chickens has increased from 160,000 at the end of last year to 650,000, an increase of more than three times. At present, a large number of hatching eggs are being incubated.
    Adapting to local conditions and mobilizing the whole people is the fundamental measure for Jilin City to develop non-staple food production. In December last year and January this year, the communes in the suburbs of the city newly built 28,000 square meters of greenhouses. At the same time, agencies, enterprises, schools, troops, urban residents, and commune members were mobilized to plant various vegetables in the room for more than 21,000 square meters.

    郊区市区通盘安排　郊区为主市区辅助
    株洲市扩大副食品生产
    吉林市蔬菜生猪家禽产量增加
    本报讯　湖南省株洲市采取城乡结合的办法发展副食品生产，目前已经收到了显著的成效。
    株洲市是我国新兴工业城市之一，解放初期只有七千人口，现在仅市区就增加到二十二万人。随着工厂企业成批的兴建，城市人口的不断上升，这给副食品的供应带来了相当大的压力。中共株洲市委为了解决这个问题，从去年下半年开始，就注意发动群众，依靠群众，大搞副食品生产。市委还采取了一系列的有效措施，首先在郊区建立了蔬菜基地，由郊区十个人民公社抽出一定的劳动力从事蔬菜生产。现在郊区的蔬菜播种面积已由过去的一千七百多亩扩大到一万六千五百多亩，品种也由过去的六十多种，增加到现在的一百多种。今年3月，市委又采取“依靠群众、自力更生、分区划片、产销见面”的措施，使蔬菜生产与消费衔接了起来。这一措施的内容就是在市委统一领导下，由商业部门组织三十个大型工厂和附近公社签订供销合同。人民公社不必通过商业部门，直接按厂矿的需要，供应蔬菜；其他集体伙食单位，则由商业部门分布在五个区的副食品商店组织产销见面。
    由于采取了这些措施，株洲市的蔬菜生产做到了自给有余，除腌制储存一部分以外，还外调一部分支援其他工矿区。
    中共株洲市委为了更进一步改善职工和城市居民生活，更好地满足城市人民的消费需要，今年又号召全市工厂、企业、机关、学校以及其他集体单位充分发挥城市生产副食品的潜力，利用屋前屋后零散地皮，大量养猪种菜。目前，全市二百四十一个集体单位已养猪八千五百多头，平均十一个人养一头猪，种菜一千亩左右，还养了家禽和水产。现在有部分工厂、学校的蔬食和肉食已达到半自给或自给。
    本报讯　吉林市在贯彻了郊区生产蔬菜为主的方针以后，目前蔬菜、生猪、家禽等产量显著提高。
    今年吉林市郊区播种蔬菜五千多公顷，比去年增加30％。其中春菜播种面积一千七百公顷，比去年增加了一倍多。由于春菜播种抓得早、抓得紧，4月下旬，春菜就源源上市，比去年提前半月左右。目前每天有三十万斤鲜菜上市，除基本上保证了本市的供应以外，并支援了长春市。在生猪的饲养方面，已经由去年年底的二万七千五百头增加到三万五千二百多头，增长了28％。鸡由去年年底的十六万只增加到六十五万只，增加了三倍多。目前还有大批种蛋正在孵化。
    因地制宜，全民动手，是吉林市发展副食品生产的根本措施。去年12月和今年1月，市郊各公社新建温室二万八千平方公尺。与此同时，发动机关、企业、学校、部队和城市居民、公社社员在室内种植了各种蔬菜二万一千多平方公尺。（附图片）
