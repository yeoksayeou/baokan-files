	"Cat Island"
	Yu Wen, translator

	Not long ago, a British surveyor and traveler came to a small coral island in the Indian Ocean called "Fregate." There are no plants on this island, and even birds do not land here. On the ground, only countless caves were found, looking like rabbit holes.
	This traveler spent the night on his small boat near the shore. However, during the night, a piercing screeching sound from the island woke him up.
	It turned out that several cats had crawled out of the holes, coming out to catch fish in the shallow water at low tide.
	According to a rough estimate, there are probably no fewer than ten thousand cats on this isolated island. It seems very likely that the ancestors of these cats were washed ashore here from nearby sunken ships.

    “猫岛”
    宇文  译
    不久前，一个英国的大地测量学家——旅行家来到印度洋的一个小小珊瑚岛上，这岛的名字叫“弗列加特”。在这个岛上没有植物，甚至连鸟类也不在这里落脚。在地上只发现有数不清的洞穴，看来好像是兔子洞。
    这位旅行家就在岸边自己的小船上过夜了。可是，夜里，岛上响起了一片刺耳的尖叫声，把他惊醒。
    原来，从洞里爬出来了几只猫，它们是当退潮的时候出来在浅水中捞鱼吃的。
    据大体的估计，在这个孤岛上大概不少于一万只猫。看来，很可能这些猫的祖先是从附近沉没的船上流落到这里来的。
