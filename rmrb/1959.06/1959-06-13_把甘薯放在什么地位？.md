What Position Should Sweet Potatoes Hold?
By a staff commentator

What position should root crop production hold? This is a question that has been debated repeatedly for a long time. Ultimately, the importance of something is determined by the extent of the benefits it brings to the people. Root crops have always been an important staple food for the Chinese people. Numerous facts can illustrate that the quantity and quality of root crop cultivation in a region often determine whether that region has a surplus or shortage of grain. Take Shandong and Hebei provinces as examples. These two provinces have similar conditions in terms of per capita grain crop planting area and crop types. 1955 was a normal year. Shandong Province was self-sufficient in grain and had a slight surplus, while Hebei Province was short by more than 2 billion jin. One important reason for the grain shortage was that Hebei Province had 0.017 mu less of root crops per person than Shandong. In the Jiaodong area of Shandong, where there is a large population and little land, and where peanuts and other cash crops are concentrated, the main way to solve the grain problem is to plant more sweet potatoes. In 1955, Guangxi Province experienced a sweet potato crop reduction due to drought, which led to an increase of more than 300 million jin of state-marketed grain. In Fuqing County, Fujian Province, due to continuous increases in sweet potato production, sweet potatoes accounted for about one-quarter of the grain area, but their output accounted for more than half of the total grain output, transforming the county from a grain-deficient area to a grain-surplus area. This is something that the broad masses of farmers understand most deeply. They say: "One season of sweet potatoes feeds us for half a year." They welcome appropriately planting more root crops and have opinions about planting fewer.

Since liberation, the planting area and yield of root crops have steadily increased, with an average annual expansion of about 8 million mu before 1957; in 1958, the area was expanded by more than 80 million mu. Except for a few areas where sweet potato planting was too concentrated, causing some difficulties due to inconvenient harvesting, storage, and allocation, it was appropriate to plant more root crops in most areas. This was a great thing. Last year, due to the expansion of the root crop area by more than 80 million mu, the increased root crop production, when converted to grain, accounted for about 40% of the total grain increase in 1958. The root crop area accounted for only 13.5% of the grain planting area, but the yield accounted for more than 25% of the total grain output. These facts illustrate that the position of root crops in grain is pivotal. We must not underestimate root crops; instead, we must make the greatest effort to strive for an even greater harvest of root crops this year.

Root crops are not only high-yielding crops, but they also have a wide range of uses. There are hundreds of ways to eat them, which is well known. Even when fine grains can fully meet the consumption needs of the people in the future, root crops will still be indispensable for diversifying varieties. Root crops are also very important livestock feed. Their vines and tubers, whether fed fresh, ensiled, or dried, are excellent feed. The nutritional value of their stems and leaves can be compared to clover, and the tubers are the most ideal feed for pigs. A yield of 4,000 jin of fresh sweet potatoes per mu is not difficult; the tubers produced per mu are enough to fatten five large pigs. This is unmatched by any grain crop. With the improvement of people's lives, to fully meet people's needs for meat and dairy products, developing root crops will be an important guarantee for increasing feed. In addition, root crops have broad industrial uses. They are the crops with the most starch and the most alcohol production, and they are important raw materials for starch wine making. At the same time, they are also good raw materials for plastics and synthetic rubber. As a rural sideline, they also have many uses, such as making vermicelli, boiling sugar, making vinegar, and making soy sauce. In recent years, various places have advocated the comprehensive utilization of root crops, making them even more valuable. In any case, root crops are by no means as unpopular as some people imagine, and the problem of "what to do if there are too many" does not exist. If they are well utilized, root crop production is still considered to be too little, not too much.

Of course, this does not mean that root crops have no shortcomings. Their high water content and thin skin make them less resistant to storage and transportation and prone to spoilage, which does bring a lot of trouble to people. There have been lessons learned from losses due to improper storage, resulting in abundant production but not abundant harvest. However, these difficulties are not insurmountable. By carefully absorbing past experiences and lessons, these difficulties can certainly be overcome.

At present, spring sweet potato cutting and planting are basically over, and planting more and better summer sweet potatoes is a crucial key to ensuring the planting area of root crops. Summer sweet potatoes have always accounted for about 80% of the total sweet potato planting area. Farmers have the planting habits and rich experience. As long as they are planted well and managed well, the yield can be no less than that of spring sweet potatoes. The amount of sweet potato planting area should be determined according to local specific conditions. If too much was planted in the past and there is relatively abundant grain, the planting area can be appropriately reduced to reduce the difficulty of harvesting and storage. If less was planted in the past, more can be planted. In areas where spring sweet potatoes were not planted enough, special attention should be paid to summer sweet potatoes.

To achieve a bumper harvest of summer sweet potatoes, in addition to doing a good job in soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, and other measures, the important key is early planting. Tubers only start to form after the stems and leaves have grown to a certain extent, and the peak of tuber enlargement is even later. If planting is too late, even if other conditions are very good, it will be difficult to give full play to its high-yield performance due to the shortened growth time. According to materials from the Sweet Potato Cultivation Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the yield of sweet potatoes planted in late July is only half of that of sweet potatoes planted in late June. The later the planting, the greater the yield reduction. In the past, the yield of many summer sweet potatoes was low, which was often due to this.

This year, summer sweet potatoes must both expand the area and ensure early planting and appropriate dense planting, which greatly increases the task of seedling cultivation. The basic measures to increase sweet potato seedlings are abundant water and sufficient fertilizer. However, among the masses in various places, due to the high and low levels of cultivation techniques, potato seedlings of greatly different quality and quantity can be obtained with the same water and fertilizer. Various places should promptly discover and summarize the people's experience in rapid seedling cultivation and promote it locally.

Organizing mutual support and allocation of sweet potato seedlings between communes, teams, or regions can also solve the problem of a shortage of sweet potato seedlings. Generally, the sweet potato seedlings in various places, communes, and teams are always surplus or deficient, and they will not be completely balanced. However, this method can only be short-distance and small-scale and can only be used as an auxiliary method. Long-distance transportation of sweet potato seedlings not only results in large losses and waste but also easily transmits diseases and insect pests, which is not a good method.

The summer sweet potato cutting and planting season is already pressing. It is hoped that party and government departments at all levels in various places will pay enough attention to this work, seize the opportunity, strengthen leadership, and strive to plant more, plant early, and plant well, to lay a good foundation for a bumper harvest of summer sweet potatoes this year. This is a very important part of the overall task of struggling to complete the grain production task for 1959 and must be placed in its proper position.

    把甘薯放在什么地位？
    本报评论员
    薯类生产应该放在什么样的地位？这是一个长期以来曾经不断争论的问题。归根到底，事物的重要程度决定于它给人民带来好处的大小。薯类从来是我国人民的一种重要口粮；有不少事实可以说明：一个地区薯类种植的多少、好坏，常常是决定这个地区粮食余缺的一个重要因素。以山东、河北两省来说，这两个省在按人口平均的粮食作物种植面积、作物种类等各方面条件都类似；1955年是一个一般年景，山东省粮食自给而稍有余，而河北则缺粮二十多亿斤。分析一下，缺粮的重要原因之一，就是河北按人口平均每个人比山东少一分七厘地的薯类。山东胶东地区人多地少，又是花生等经济作物的集中产区，解决粮食问题主要的办法就是多种甘薯。1955年广西省曾因天旱甘薯减收，致使统销粮增加三亿多斤。福建省福清县由于甘薯连年增产，占粮食面积四分之一左右的甘薯，产量折合起来占粮食总产量的一半以上，使全县由缺粮变为余粮。这一点，广大农民体会得最为深刻。他们说：
  “一季红薯半年粮。”对于适当多种薯类是欢迎的，对于少种薯类是有意见的。
    解放以来，薯类种植面积和产量一直稳步上升，1957年以前平均每年扩大面积在八百万亩左右；1958年扩大了八千多万亩。除了个别地区因为种植甘薯过于集中，因收获、保存、调剂不便而发生了一些困难以外，大部地区多种薯类是适当的。这是一件大好事。去年由于薯类面积扩大了八千多万亩，增产的薯类折合粮食，占1958年粮食增产总数的40％左右。薯类面积仅占粮食播种面积13.5％，产量却占粮食总产量的25％以上。这些事实正说明了：薯类在粮食中的地位是举足轻重的，决不可轻视薯类，而要尽极大努力争取今年薯类更大的丰收。
    薯类不仅是高产作物，它的用途也很广。它的吃法不下几百种，是为人所共知的；即使将来到了细粮能充分满足人民生活消费的时候，薯类也是为调剂品种所不可缺少的。薯类同时也是很重要的牲畜饲料，它的蔓叶和块根，不论鲜喂、青贮、晒干，都是极好的饲料。它的茎叶的营养价值可以媲美三叶草，薯块更是喂猪最理想的饲料。亩产四千斤鲜薯，并不是难事；一亩地所产的块根，足可以肥育五头大猪。这是任何粮食作物难以比拟的。随着人民生活的提高，要充分满足人们对肉类、乳品的需要；发展薯类将是增加饲料的重要保证。此外，薯类还有广阔的工业用途。它是淀粉最多、出酒最多的作物，是重要的淀粉制酒原料。同时，它还是塑料、合成橡胶等的好原料。作为农村副业，它也有多种用途，如作粉丝、熬糖、作醋、作酱油等等。近年来，各地提倡综合利用薯类，更使它身价百倍。无论如何，薯类决不像有些人所想像的是不受欢迎的作物，“多了怎末办”的问题并不存在。如果很好地把它利用起来，薯类生产现在还是嫌少，而不是多了。
    当然，这并不是说薯类就没有缺点。水分大、皮薄，不耐贮运，容易腐烂，的确给人们带来不少麻烦，曾经有过由于收贮不当遭到损失，丰产而不能丰收的教训。但是，这些困难并不是不能克服的。好好吸收过去的经验和教训，一定能克服这些困难。
    目前春薯扦插基本结束，多种和种好夏薯是保证薯类种植面积的重要关键。夏甘薯历来就占甘薯种植总面积的80％左右，农民有种植习惯，经验也丰富，只要种得好，管得好，产量可以不低于春薯。甘薯种植面积的多少，要根据当地具体条件来决定。如过去种的过多，粮食又比较富裕的地方，可以适当少种，以减少收贮的困难；过去种植较少的地方，就可以多种一些。春薯种得不足的地区，对夏薯就更要特别重视。
    要夏甘薯丰产，除了作好土、肥、水、种、密等项措施以外，重要的关键是早插。薯块要在茎叶生长到一定程度以后才开始形成，薯块膨大的盛期又要晚些；如果插植过晚，即使其他条件很好，由于生长时间缩短了，也难以发挥它的高产性能。据中国农业科学院甘薯栽培研究所材料，7月下旬扦插的甘薯，产量只有6月下旬扦插的甘薯的一半。扦插越晚，减产幅度越大。过去不少夏甘薯产量较低，往往是失之于此。
    夏甘薯今年既要扩大面积，又要保证早插，适当密植，这就大大增加了育苗工作的任务。增产薯苗的基本措施在于水多肥足；但是，在各地群众中间，由于培育技术的高低，用同样的水肥可以得出质和量大不相同的薯苗。各地应当及时发现和总结群众的快速育苗经验，就地推广。
    在社、队、或地区之间组织薯苗的相互支援和调剂，也可以解决不少缺少薯苗的问题。各地各社各队的薯苗一般总是有盈有缺，不会完全平衡。但这种作法，只能是近程的、较少量的，只能作为一种辅助的办法。长途调运薯苗，不但损失大、浪费多，而且易传染病虫害，不是个好办法。
    夏薯扦插时期已经紧迫，望各地各级党政部门，对这个工作应当予以足够的重视，抓紧时机，加强领导，力争多种、早种、种好，为今年夏薯大丰收打好基础。这是为完成1959年的粮食生产任务而斗争的总任务中很重要的一部分，必须把它放在应占的地位上。
