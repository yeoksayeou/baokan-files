    Visiting a Lathe Operator's Home
    By Our Correspondent Lin Hai
    "The living standards of the working people are getting better day by day," this is a true reflection of the people's lives in socialist countries. Not long ago, the decision of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government on the seventh reduction of prices, increase in subsidies for families with many children, increase in pensions, and preferential treatment for the elderly, widowed, and disabled due to work injuries, once again proved this point.
    These measures to further improve the people's living standards have brought great encouragement to the working people, and this matter has become the focus of people's conversations. At the dining table in the cafeteria, during family reunions in the evening, and at moments when friends meet, this is such a pleasant topic.
        ××××
    Living in our fraternal country of Czechoslovakia, their happiness deeply infects us. A few days ago, we visited a worker's family with many children, spent a pleasant evening with them, and shared their joy.
    One evening, we arrived at the ČKD Dukla factory, where the lathe operator Haling was already waiting for us, and he led us to his home.
    This is a four-story building, and he lives in a suite with two bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, and a bathroom. In the bright and clean living room, there is a set of coffee-colored furniture, the glass cabinet is full of books, the floor is covered with carpets, and the walls are hung with oil paintings. The dining room has a white sideboard and dining table, and a medium-sized radio is placed on the sideboard.
    The host welcomed us to the dining room, and a seven- or eight-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl shyly reached out to say good evening to us, looking at us strangers with childlike smiles. The host has five children, the oldest is thirteen years old, and the youngest is only about one year old. Speaking of children, Haling said: "With five children, the burden is naturally heavier, but we do not feel that life is difficult. The Party and the government have always cared about the lives of the working people, especially families with many children. Like this price reduction, families with many children benefit the most, and from April, the children's subsidies will also increase. Even without the increase, we can receive a subsidy of 700 crowns (Czech currency) per month for our five children." He told us that his monthly salary is 1,750 crowns, and the children's subsidies are about two-fifths of his salary. He said that this is a considerable income, which makes them not worry about life because of having many children.
    Speaking of this, the topic naturally turned to the issue of price reductions. Haling said excitedly: "Price reductions were expected, but what surprised everyone was that they were implemented so early. People always said in ordinary discussions that they would not be implemented until the summer at the earliest. But the Party and the government chose 'March 8th,' this very meaningful day, to start the seventh price reduction, which is the best gift for women." Haling then told us how he felt when he saw this decision. He said: "That morning, when I returned home from my night shift, I saw this news in the newspaper. When I got home, I couldn't sleep, so I calculated a detailed account of the family's expenses with my wife. According to our preliminary calculations, after the price reduction, we will save 100 crowns per month on food alone. In addition, the children's subsidies increased by 170 crowns per month, which is equivalent to receiving two months' salary more a year." They have not yet calculated the money saved due to the price reduction of daily necessities and children's clothing, and among the items in this price reduction, children's clothing has the largest price reduction, some even reduced by one-third.
    The Haling family spends very little on rent and utilities each month. Rent expenses account for only about 4% of the total income, while we know that in the United States, rent accounts for more than 17% of the expenses of a worker's family. Their biggest monthly expense is food. The characteristic of this price reduction in Czechoslovakia is that in addition to the large price reduction of children's clothing, the food aspect also has the largest reduction, and it includes the most important foods, such as flour, rice, meat, sugar, butter, etc.
    The host is a very talkative person. He said, how can we not be moved when we see that the Party and the government are so concerned about the interests of the working people? After the newspaper announced this decision, the workers held discussions, set out guarantees for completing tasks ahead of schedule, and once again formulated plans for saving raw materials and caring for machines. Haling said, we are definitely not making guarantees casually, we must realize them if we propose them.

    Although Haling is only thirty-nine years old, he is already a veteran worker with twenty years of service. In the past, he was an ordinary worker making bottle stoppers. After liberation, he participated in the factory's labor night school and gained the opportunity to learn technology. Now he has become an excellent lathe operator, has received the title of model worker, and has honorably joined the Communist Party. He is also a cadre of the factory's grassroots Party organization.
    He explained his experience to us. He said: "I experienced the entire war years and also worked under capitalist rule. At that time, the life of workers could be summarized by the words 'pain and poverty.' But now look at the lives of our workers! In 1951, only a few people in our factory had motorcycles, but now the factory has to build a parking garage for workers to store their motorcycles, and buying cars is no longer an isolated case in our factory. Because there are too many people who want to buy cars, they have to register in advance, and even queue up to register. In the past, workers only queued up to register when looking for a job! In the past, when people were poorly clothed and fed, the threat of unemployment was often a heavy burden on the minds of workers, and there was no interest or enthusiasm for labor at all. But now, 'unemployment' no longer exists in our country. Our country's construction is advancing rapidly, and now we are worried about having too few people. Our factory will recruit a large number of workers this year, and the workers are now working with completely different feelings. They see that their hard work not only makes the country rich and strong, but also brings an increasingly better life. The workers deeply realize that today the interests of the country are completely consistent with the interests of the working people. For example, recently the government has been vigorously solving the housing problem and calling on the working people to help the country solve this problem together. In our factory, more than seventy workers are willing to take out more than 250,000 crowns to build houses."
    Unknowingly, we had been talking for more than two hours, and it was already delaying the children's dinner time. When we embarked on our way home in the evening breeze, the shadow of the Haling family was always in my mind. I couldn't help but think that when the father returns from work, the children return from school, the housewife sets a rich dinner on the table, and the whole family happily talks about the price reduction, the factory's production upsurge, and the children's happy school life under the bright lights, what a happy moment this must be!

    在一个旋工家里作客
    本报记者  林海
      “劳动人民的生活日益美好”，这是社会主义国家人民生活的真实的写照。不久前，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央和政府关于第七次减低物价、增加多子女家庭补助金、提高养老金和对孤寡及因公残废的人们的优抚金的决定，又一次证明了这一点。
    这些进一步提高人民生活水平的措施给劳动人民带来了巨大的鼓舞，这件事已成为人们谈话的中心。在食堂的餐桌上，家人团聚的夜晚，朋友们见面的时刻，这是一个多么愉快的话题。
        ××××
    生活在我们兄弟之邦的捷克斯洛伐克，他们的快乐也深深地感染了我们。几天前，我们访问了一个多子女的工人家庭，和他们一道度过了一个愉快的夜晚，分享了他们的欢乐。
    一天傍晚，我们来到了捷卡德—杜克拉工厂，旋工哈林早在等候我们了，他把我们领到了他的家里。
    这是一幢四层楼的房子，他住的一套有两间卧室，一个客厅，一间餐室，还有洗澡间等。在窗明几净的客厅里，摆着一套咖啡色的家具，玻璃橱里摆满了书籍，地上铺着地毯，墙上挂着油画。餐室里是白色的餐橱和餐桌，餐橱上摆着一架中等大小的收音机。
    主人把我们迎到餐室里，一个七八岁的男孩和一个五岁的小女孩羞涩地向我们伸出手来道晚安，他们带着稚气的微笑看着我们这些陌生的来客。主人有五个孩子，最大的十三岁，最小的才一岁左右。谈起孩子，哈林说：“五个孩子，自然负担重一些，可是我们并没有感到生活困难。党和政府从来就是关心劳动人民的生活的，特别是多子女的家庭。像这次减低物价，多子女的家庭得到的好处最多，而且从4月份起，孩子的补助金还要增加，就是不增加，我们五个孩子每月也可领到七百克朗（捷币）的补助费。”他告诉我们，他每月有一千七百五十克朗的工资，孩子们的补助费约等于他的工资的五分之二，他说，这是一笔不小的收入，这使得他们完全不致因为孩子多而为生活发愁。
    谈到这里，话题自然转向降低物价的问题。哈林兴奋地说：“减低物价本是在意料中的，可是出乎大家意外的是实行得这样早，大家在平常谈论中总是说最早也要到夏天才会实行。但党和政府选择了‘三八节’这个顶有意义的日子开始了第七次的减低物价，这是对妇女们再好也不过的礼物了。”哈林接着告诉我们他看到这个决定时的心情。他说：“那天清晨我值完夜班回家时，在报纸上看到了这个消息。我回到家里，觉也睡不着了，就和妻子一道对全家的开支算了一笔细账，根据我们初步的计算，减低物价后，每月单是食物就要节约一百克朗，再加上每月增加了孩子的补助费一百七十克朗，这样一年就等于多领两个月的工资。”由于日用品和儿童衣物的减价而节约的钱，他们还没有计算在内，而这一次减低物价的项目中，孩子们的衣物是减价最多的，有的甚至减少了三分之一。
    哈林一家每月花在房租水电等方面的费用是很少的，房租的开支只占整个收入的4％左右，而我们知道在美国房租要占到工人家庭开支的17％以上。他们每月的开支最大的项目是食物。而这次捷克斯洛伐克降低物价的特点除了孩子们的衣物减价很多外，食品方面也是降低最多的，而且包括了最主要的食品，如面粉、大米、肉类、糖、黄油等。
    男主人是一个十分健谈的人。他说，我们看到党和政府对劳动人民的利益这样关心，心里能不感动么？在报纸公布这个决定后，工人们就进行了讨论，订出了提前完成任务的保证，还再一次订出节约原料、爱护机器等计划。哈林说，我们决不是随便提出保证的，提出了我们就一定要实现它。
                ×　×　×　×
    哈林虽然还只三十九岁，但是已经是有二十年工龄的老工人了。过去他是一个做瓶塞的普通工人，解放后，他参加了工厂的劳动夜校学习，获得了学习技术的机会，现在他已经成为一个优秀的旋工，曾经得到过模范工人的称号，并光荣地加入了共产党，现在他还是工厂基层党组织的干部。
    他向我们阐述了他的经历。他说：“我经历了整个的战争年代，也在资本主义统治下做过工，那时候工人的生活只要用‘痛苦和贫困’这几个字就可概括无遗了。但是现在你看看我们工人的生活！1951年时我们工厂只有几个人有摩托车，而现在工厂不得不盖一座存车房让工人存放摩托车，而买汽车的在我们工厂也已经不是个别的人，因为要买汽车的人太多了，总得预先登记，甚至还得排着队去登记。过去工人只有在找工作的时候才去排队登记呢！在过去那种衣不暖、食不饱的日子里，失业的威胁经常是工人们心头沉重的负担，根本谈不上对劳动的兴趣和热情。而现在，‘失业’这件事在我们国家里早就不存在了。我们国家的建设事业一日千里，现在发愁的是人手太少，像我们工厂里今年就将要招收大批的工人，而工人们今天也完全带着不同的心情在进行劳动，他们看到自己的辛勤劳动不仅使国家富强了，而且也带来了日益美好的生活。工人们深切地体会到今天国家的利益是和劳动人民的利益完全一致的。例如，最近政府大力解决住房问题，并号召劳动人民帮助国家来共同解决这一问题，在我们的工厂就有七十多个工人愿意拿出二十五万多克朗来建筑住宅。”
    不知不觉已谈了两个多小时，已经耽误了孩子们的晚餐时间了。当我们迎着晚风踏上归途时，哈林一家人的影子总在我的脑海里转，我不禁想到，这一家当父亲劳动归来，孩子们放学回家，主妇在桌上摆满了丰盛的晚餐，在明亮的灯光下，全家愉快地谈起物价的减低，工厂的生产高潮以及孩子们快乐的学校生活的时刻，这该是多么幸福的时刻！（附图片）
