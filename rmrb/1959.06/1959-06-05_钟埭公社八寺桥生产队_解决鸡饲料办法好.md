Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou News, The Basiqiao Production Team of Zhongdai Commune in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, has a large number of poultry raised by its members because the feed problem is well solved. At present, the team has a total of 2,788 chickens, ducks, and geese, with an average of 25 raised per household.

The main methods of this production team to solve the feed problem are: 1. Cultivating a large number of green fodder. In addition to regularly cutting wild grass and撈 water plants as feed, they also use the front and back of houses and the edges of fields to plant pumpkins, vegetables, and radishes. In this way, chickens and ducks can eat green grass in the spring, sweet potato vines, revolutionary grass, and pumpkin leaves in the summer and autumn, and vegetables and radishes in the winter. 2. Capture live food. Mobilize children and elderly members to pick up 田螺,摸螺蛳, catch loach and grasshoppers as feed. These feeds can better promote the growth of poultry, enhance resistance, and increase egg production. 3. Implement artificial insect breeding. Dig ditches about two feet deep by the river, bamboo garden, and mulberry land. Lay a layer of rice straw and a layer of cow dung garbage in the ditch, and pour warm water on it every day. After a week, a large number of small insects can be cultivated to feed chickens and ducks. 4. Use rice straw,瘪谷, rapeseed husks, etc. to make powdered feed. 5. Carry out mobile grazing in the harvested fields and idle land.

After the implementation of these methods, the source of feed for poultry has been greatly increased, and the enthusiasm of members to raise poultry has been generally improved. (Attached picture)

    解决鸡饲料办法好
    新华社杭州讯　浙江平湖县钟埭公社八寺桥生产队因为饲料问题解决得好，社员饲养家禽的数量多。目前，全队共有鸡、鸭、鹅二千七百八十八只，平均每户饲养二十五只。
    这个生产队解决饲料的主要办法是：一、大量培植青饲料。除经常割野草、捞水草做饲料外，还利用屋前屋后、田头地边种植南瓜、青菜、萝卜等。这样，鸡鸭在春天可以吃青草，夏秋吃蕃薯藤、革命草、南瓜叶，冬天吃青菜、萝卜等。二、捕捉活食。发动儿童和老年社员拾田螺、摸螺蛳、捉泥鳅和蚱蜢等作饲料。这些饲料，可以更好地促进家禽生长，增强抵抗力，还能提高产蛋率。三、实行人工育虫。在河边、竹园、桑地里挖二尺来深的沟，沟里铺一层稻草、一层牛粪垃圾，每天用温水泼浇，一星期后，可以培育出大量小虫，用来喂鸡鸭。四、利用稻草、瘪谷、油菜籽壳等制成粉末饲料。五、在收割后的田里和闲地上进行流动放牧。
    这些方法实行后，大大增加了家禽的饲料来源，社员饲养家禽的积极性普遍提高。（附图片）
