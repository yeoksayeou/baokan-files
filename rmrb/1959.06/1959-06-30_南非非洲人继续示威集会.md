    Xinhua News Agency, June 29th, Johannesburg dispatch: The South African African National Congress held a demonstration rally in Johannesburg on the 28th, attended by many Africans, to protest the South African government's policy of racial discrimination.
    Amidst shouts of "Freedom," participants at the meeting burned some cigarettes produced by a tobacco company that supports the ruling Nationalist Party government. They also burned some potatoes produced by white farms to protest the slave labor system imposed on African workers by these farms. The authorities deployed police near the venue.
    On the same day, in Cape Town in the south, approximately five hundred Africans held a similar protest rally. A tear gas canister, pre-positioned in the ceiling of the venue, suddenly exploded, forcing those attending the meeting to leave. Raguma, the person in charge of organizing the rally, accused the police of being responsible for planting the tear gas canister in the hall.

    南非非洲人继续示威集会
    新华社29日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非非洲人国民大会28日在约翰内斯堡举行了一次有许多非洲人参加的示威集会，抗议南非政府的种族歧视政策。
    参加会议的人在高呼“自由”声中，当场焚毁了由一家支持执政的国民党政府的烟草公司出产的一些香烟。他们还焚毁了一些由白人农场生产出来的马铃薯，表示抗议这些农场对非洲工人施行奴隶劳动制度。当局在会场附近布置了警察。
    同一天，在南部的开普敦，约有五百名非洲人举行同类的抗议集会。事先设置在会场天花板上的一枚催泪弹突然爆炸，使参加会议的人不得不离开会场。组织这次集会的负责人拉古马指责说，警察应对在大厅上设置催泪弹一事负责。
