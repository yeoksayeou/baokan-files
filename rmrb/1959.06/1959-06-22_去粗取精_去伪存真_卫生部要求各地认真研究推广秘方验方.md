The Ministry of Health Requires All Regions to Seriously Study and Promote Secret and Effective Prescriptions

    This newspaper reports: In order to enable secret and effective prescriptions to play a greater role in eliminating diseases and protecting the people's health, the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China recently issued a notice to the health departments and bureaus of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions regarding the sorting out, studying, and promoting of secret and effective prescriptions.

    The notice pointed out: Since the conference on traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals last year, a widespread campaign to collect secret and effective prescriptions has been carried out across the country, and great achievements have been made. At present, in addition to continuing to actively discover secret and effective prescriptions with outstanding curative effects hidden among the people, all regions must especially organize traditional Chinese medicine research institutions to effectively sort out the collected secret and effective prescriptions, so that truly effective secret prescriptions can play a greater role in eliminating diseases and protecting people's health. This is a very important task for health departments.

    The notice pointed out: At present, tens of millions of secret and effective prescriptions have been collected nationwide, many of which are repetitive and not entirely reasonable. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the crude, select the refined, eliminate the false, and preserve the true, and to sort them out selectively and with focus. Adopt the working method of the mass line, conduct in-depth interviews to ascertain the sources of the prescriptions and the cases treated. Clarify the situation regarding drug names, varieties, preparation methods, dosages, contraindications, and reactions. When necessary, conduct key clinical observations to confirm efficacy, clarify the scope of indications, and study treatment patterns, so as to promote application with a responsible attitude. Generally, secret and effective prescriptions that have been reviewed and identified as effective and harmless should be sorted into categories and compiled into volumes for use and promotion in mass medical practice.

    去粗取精  去伪存真
    卫生部要求各地认真研究推广秘方验方
    本报讯　为使秘方验方在消灭疾病保护人民身体健康中发挥更大的作用，中华人民共和国卫生部最近向各省、市、自治区卫生厅、局发出关于整理研究推广秘方验方的通知。
    通知指出：自去年中医中药工作会议以后，全国各地广泛开展了收集秘方验方的采风运动，已取得很大成绩。目前各地除仍需继续积极发掘蕴藏民间具有卓越疗效的秘方验方外，特别对已收集的秘方验方，必须组织中医药研究机构切实进行整理，使确有疗效的秘方验方在消灭疾病、保护人民健康上发挥更大的作用，这是卫生部门一项很重要的工作。
    通知指出：现在全国收集的秘方验方多至千万，其中重复以及不尽合理的不少，因此必须去粗取精、去伪存真，有选择有重点地进行整理，采取群众路线的工作方法，深入访问验方的来源和治验病例；对药物名称、品种、配制方法、服用剂量、以及禁忌、反应等，都要摸清情况，必要时进行重点的临床观察，肯定疗效，明确适应症的范围和研究治疗规律，以认真负责的态度推广应用。一般经过审查鉴定有效无害的秘方验方，应分门别类的整理成册，以便在群众医疗实践中使用推广。
