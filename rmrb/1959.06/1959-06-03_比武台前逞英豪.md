It is said that there were two heroic figures in the Daye Steel Plant, one was Wu Jinfu, the red banner No. 1 electric furnace team leader named by the municipal party committee; the other was Yu Mingfu, the runner-up of the National Youth Electric Furnace Competition and leader of the No. 2 youth electric furnace team. These two team leaders led more than 20 warriors from the Red Banner Furnace and Youth Furnace, producing more than 6,000 tons of extra steel for the country from January last year to April this year. Who wouldn't praise them?

Speaking of April 3rd this year, the factory issued a call for all employees to fight hard for a month to welcome the "May Day" festival. As soon as the news spread, Yu Mingfu took the lead and immediately approached Wu Jinfu, the Red Banner Furnace team leader, on behalf of the Youth Furnace workers, and said, "Quickly set up a challenge arena and start a battle!" Wu Jinfu raised his voice and said, "Okay! What are the conditions?" Yu Mingfu took out his notebook and read:

"Fight hard for a month to show your skills, ensure both quantity and quality, strive to finish half a day early, and be hailed as heroes at the 'May Day' meeting." Wu Jinfu said, "Not bad, listen to me: Fight hard for a month to create miracles, strive for high yield and high quality, the Red Banner team will definitely surpass the Youth Furnace, and we'll see who's better at the 'May Day' meeting." The two shook hands on the spot as proof and signed the "battle agreement."

The next day, Yu Mingfu and Wu Jinfu arrived at the furnace with their teams more than an hour before their shift. The Red Banner Furnace adopted the method of "early slag making, multiple slag skimming," not letting go of a second; the Youth Furnace adopted the method of "high-temperature thin patching, one-time charging," competing for every half-ounce. Wu Jinfu, the Red Banner team leader, invigorated his spirits and led two assistants, opened the furnace door, and, braving the high-temperature radiation, spent four minutes skimming a furnace of slag, shortening the planned time by two minutes. But he also said to his assistants: "For the next furnace of steel, let's three divide the work of slag skimming, each responsible for one side, and we must grab another thirty seconds." At this moment, someone suddenly said from behind: "Hey, Lao Wu, you really want to beat the Youth Furnace!" Wu Jinfu turned around and saw that it was Workshop Director Pang Dejin, and hurriedly said with a smile: "Director, our opponent is too strong, we can't do it without doing this. Besides, grabbing back thirty seconds means a dozen kilograms of high-quality steel, which is a contribution to the country!" Pang Dejin looked at the situation inside the furnace with his blue glasses and said: "Lao Wu, you are right, but I'll be honest with you, the Youth Furnace has already taken a step ahead of you." Wu Jinfu said in surprise: "How so?" Pang Dejin smiled and said something that Wu Jinfu immediately understood: It turned out that although Yu Mingfu's team was vigorous and energetic, they were also resourceful. Before starting work today, they had calculated a detailed account of expanding the furnace body: if the inside of the furnace is kept flat and free of residual steel and slag, then the three-ton electric furnace can produce four and a half tons of steel, and at least three and a half tons more per day. Therefore, after taking over the shift, Yu Mingfu, disregarding the high-temperature baking and hot steam, led a team of brothers to clean the inside of the furnace so that it was large and flat. The first furnace of steel produced a full five tons, creating the first high-yield record. Wu Jinfu immediately said: "Good! We'll do the same tomorrow!"

On the third day, at the workshop meeting, the results were announced first: the Red Banner Furnace exceeded the two-day plan by 2.5%, and the Youth Furnace exceeded the two-day plan by 2.5%. Then, experiences were introduced. Wu Jinfu of the Red Banner Furnace said: "We mainly learned from the Youth Furnace's experience in expanding the furnace body." Yu Mingfu of the Youth Furnace said: "We mainly learned from the Red Banner Furnace's experience in fast slag skimming." The team leaders present were surprised: "You two, one from the east of the river, one from the west, how could the experience be spread so quickly?" Yu Mingfu said: "Director Pang introduced it to us." Everyone laughed loudly when they heard this: "Ha! So there's a matchmaker!" Team leader Mou Lin of the No. 6 furnace said: "No wonder you two are always so closely matched in every competition!"

Time flies, no need to elaborate. In the blink of an eye, it was April 30th. The hard work in April had already made a lot of improvements to these two furnaces. The average daily output had increased by about 3% compared to the first quarter, and the qualification rate had reached or exceeded the national requirements. At 11:35 a.m. on this day, it happened to be the last furnace of steel to complete the April task. Yu Mingfu, the Youth Furnace team leader, watched the white molten steel boiling in the furnace about to be tapped. He was very excited. He thought, I must refine this furnace of steel before twelve o'clock to fulfill my promise to welcome "May Day." As he was thinking, he suddenly heard a burst of gongs and drums, and Wu Jinfu came over. He immediately understood: the Red Banner Furnace had completed the plan! He immediately jumped onto a scrap steel ingot mold and waved a thick and powerful hand in the air: "Tap the steel!" Then there was a loud crash, and the silver steel flowed into the molten steel bucket, flashing with metal-like steel flowers, filling the entire workshop. Then there was a chorus of congratulations. Workshop Director Pang Dejin straightened his collar and solemnly announced: "In order to welcome the great holiday of the working people, the Red Banner No. 1 electric furnace and the Youth No. 2 electric furnace have simultaneously completed the April plan half a day ahead of schedule."

Wu Jinfu and Yu Mingfu walked into the workshop office side by side. Representing the heroes of the two furnaces, they began to brew for a greater battle in May. This is exactly:

The waves of the Yangtze River push the waves ahead,
Each wave is stronger than the last,
Shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, leaping forward together,
To produce more steel for the motherland!

    比武台前逞英豪
    袁锦屏
    话说大冶钢厂有两位英雄人物，一个是市委命名的红旗一号电炉班长，名叫吴金福；一个叫余明富，是荣获过全国青年电炉竞赛亚军的二号青年电炉班长。这两个班长领导着红旗炉、青年炉二十多名战将，从去年1月到今年4月，为国家多生产了六千多吨钢，谁不夸奖。
    单讲今年4月3日这天，厂里发下一道号召，要全厂职工大战一月，迎接“五一”节。消息传开，余明富捷道登先，马上代表青年炉工人，找上红旗炉班长吴金福，说道：“快快摆开擂台战一场！”吴金福提高嗓子说：“好哇！你说，多高的条件？”余明富拿出笔记本，念道：
  “大战一月显本领，产量质量定保证，力争提前半天整，‘五一’会上称英雄。”吴金福说道：“不错，听我的：大战一月创奇迹，高产优质争第一，红旗定超青年炉，
  ‘五一’会上见高低。”两人当场握手为凭，立下了“战表”。
    第二天，余明富、吴金福早在接班前的一个多小时，就带着人马到炉子来了。那红旗炉采用的是“提前造渣，多次扒渣”，一分半秒不让；这青年炉采用的是“高温薄补，一次装料”，半斤八两也要争。那红旗班长吴金福，抖擞精神，带领两个助手，拉开炉门，在高温逼射下，激战四分钟扒完了一炉渣，比计划时间缩短了两分钟。但他还对助手们说道：“下一炉钢的扒渣时间，咱三人来个分工，各管一方，定要再抓回三十秒钟不可。”正在这时候，突然背后一人说道：“好老吴，你硬要把青年炉比下不可呀！”吴金福回头一看，原来是车间主任庞德金，忙笑着说道：“主任，咱们的对手太硬啦，不这样不行，再说，抓回三十秒钟，就是十几公斤优质钢，是国家的一份力量！”庞德金用蓝镜片看了下炉里的情况，说道：“老吴，你说得对，不过我老实告诉你，青年炉已经走在你们前面一步了。”吴金福吃惊地说：“何以见得？”庞德金笑了笑，一席话说得吴金福顿时明白过来：原来那余明富班虽然血气方刚，却是智多谋广。今日上班之前，他们就算了一个扩大炉体的细账：如果经常使炉内保持平整，不留残钢残渣，那么容积的三吨电炉，便可以出钢四吨半，一天至少也能多产三点五吨。因此，在接班之后，这余明富不顾高温烘烤、热气蒸人，带领一班弟兄，将那炉子内部清洗得又大又平，第一炉钢就出了整整五吨，创造了第一个高产纪录。吴金福马上说道“好呀！咱明天也这样干！”
    第三天，在车间碰头会上，首先公布战果：红旗炉超过两日计划百分之二点五，青年炉两日超过计划百分之二点五。接着介绍经验。红旗炉吴金福说：“我们主要是学习了青年炉扩大炉体的经验。”青年炉余明富说：“我们主要是学习了红旗炉快速扒渣的经验。”到会的各炉长听了大哗：“你们两家，一家河东，一家河西，经验何以传布得这样快？”余明富说：“是庞主任给我们介绍的。”大家一听，才哄然大笑道：“嗬！原来有一个牵线人！”六号炉长牟琳说：“难怪你们两家每次竞赛难分高低嘛！”
    时光冉冉，不必细赘。转眼间到了4月30日。4月份的大战，已经使这两座炉子有了不少的提高，平均日产量都比第一季度提高了3％左右，合格率也达到和超过了国家要求。这天正午十一点三十五分，恰巧又都是完成4月份任务的最后一炉钢。这青年炉班长余明富看着那炉里沸腾着的白色钢水马上就能出钢，心情十分激动，他想，誓要在十二点钟以前炼好这炉钢，实现迎接
  “五一”的诺言。想着想着，猛听得一阵锣鼓响，走来了吴金福，他顿时明白过来：红旗炉完成计划了！他马上跳上一块废钢锭模上，把一只粗而有力的手往空中一挥：“出钢！”接着是哗啦的一声巨响，银色的钢水流进了盛钢桶，闪耀着金石般的钢花，充满了整个车间。接着是一片庆贺之声，车间主任庞德金拉了拉上衣领子，郑重的宣布说：“为了迎接伟大的劳动人民的节日，红旗一号电炉和青年二号电炉，同时提前半天完成4月份计划。”
    吴金福、余明富并肩走进了车间办公室。他俩代表着两座炉子的英雄，又开始酝酿着5月份的更大战斗。这正是：
    长江后浪推前浪，
    一浪更比一浪强，
    并肩携手同跃进，
    要为祖国多出钢！
