Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 2nd—The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has decided to establish a new reclamation area in the Altay region to develop diversified operations of industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery. The Agricultural Tenth Division, responsible for the construction of the new reclamation area, has recently been formally established. Thousands of cadres for reclamation area construction, technicians, and young male and female workers have successively arrived at the new reclamation area. This is the eighth military reclamation area opened up by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in Xinjiang. In recent years, the military region's production forces have established seven large-scale military reclamation areas in Aksu, Yanqi, Yili, Hami, Urumqi, Shihezi, Usu, and other places, reclaiming 7.8 million mu of land.

The Altay region has rich mineral resources; nearly 10 million mu of wasteland and virgin forests; and grassland with more than ten rivers and lakes, including the Ertix River, Ulungur River, and Bukseir River, and other water resources. Based on these conditions, the Agricultural Tenth Division of the Production and Construction Corps will adopt the principles of suiting measures to local conditions, comprehensive utilization, and simultaneous development of industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery. In addition to large-scale mining and fishing, the preliminary plan is to reclaim 2 to 3 million mu of wasteland within five years and develop various livestock to about 300,000 to 400,000 head.

    新疆建设兵团开发阿勒泰地区
    新华社乌鲁木齐2日电　新疆军区生产建设兵团决定在阿勒泰地区建立一个工农林牧渔多种经营的新垦区，担任新垦区建设工作的农业第十师最近已正式成立。数千名垦区建设干部、技术人员和男女青年职工，已经陆续到达新垦区。这是新疆生产建设部队在新疆开辟的第八个军垦区。最近几年来，军区生产部队在阿克苏、焉耆、伊犁、哈密、乌鲁木齐、石河子、乌苏等地已建立了七个大型军垦区，开荒种地达七百八十万亩。
    阿勒泰地区有丰富的矿藏；近一千万亩的荒地和原始森林；草原境内有额尔齐斯河、乌伦古河和布克赛尔河等大小十余条河流及湖泊等水利资源。生产建设兵团农十师根据这些条件，将采取因地制宜、综合利用、工农林牧渔同时并举的方针，除了大搞采矿、捕鱼外，初步计划五年内开荒二百到三百万亩，发展各种家畜三、四十万只左右。
