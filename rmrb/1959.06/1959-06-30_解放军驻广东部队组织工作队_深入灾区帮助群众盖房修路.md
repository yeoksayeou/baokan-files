Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 29th. After helping the local people overcome the flood, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the Guangdong area immediately devoted themselves to assisting the people in the disaster areas to restore production and rebuild their homes.

When the flood had not completely receded, the troops stationed in the Dongjiang area organized fourteen work teams with more than 480 people to go to disaster areas such as Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, and Dongguan to organize people to help themselves through production, help the masses build houses, build bridges, repair roads, and replant seedlings in the fields. Medical personnel in the work team also carried out disease prevention and treatment work among the people in the disaster areas. The work team members shared weal and woe with the people in the disaster areas, working and laboring together. The people in the disaster areas said with emotion: "When the flood surrounded us, the PLA came to save us. When the flood receded, they came to help us again. They are really our own soldiers."

After helping the local people repel the extraordinary flood peak, the officers and soldiers stationed in the Chaozhou area immediately wielded their sickles and went into battle to help the masses harvest rice. The Second Platoon of the Engineering Company of a certain battalion went out to perform its duties for four days and nights. Before they had rested well, they participated in the rush harvest. Colonel Yang Shaoliang is a third-class disabled soldier with limited movement in his right arm. While busy directing, he also participated in the rush harvest. There were also a group of officers' family members in the rush harvest ranks. They harvested carefully and meticulously, ensuring quality and quantity. In a rice field of more than 80 mu that was submerged by water, the rice was harvested slowly and gropingly in the water. After harvesting once, they checked again to make sure they didn't miss a single rice plant. After two days of hard work, they harvested more than 1,000 mu of rice and dispatched vehicles to help the commune transport 50,000 jin of grain.

    解放军驻广东部队组织工作队
    深入灾区帮助群众盖房修路
    新华社广州29日电　中国人民解放军驻广东地区部队，在帮助当地人民战胜洪水侵袭之后，随即投入协助灾区群众恢复生产，重建家园的工作。
    驻东江地区部队，当洪水还没有完全退落的时候，就组织了有四百八十多人参加的十四个工作队，分别到惠阳、博罗、增城、东莞等灾区，组织人民生产自救，帮助群众盖房、架桥修路和在田间补苗。工作队中的医务人员还在灾区群众中进行防治疾病的工作。工作队人员与灾区群众同甘共苦，一边工作，一边劳动。灾区人民感动地说：“洪水包围时，解放军来救我们，洪水退了，又来帮助我们，真是我们的子弟兵。”
    驻潮州地区部队官兵在帮助当地群众击退特大洪峰以后，立即挥镰上阵，帮助群众抢收水稻。某营架设连二排外出执勤四昼夜，回来还没有休息好，就参加了抢收。杨绍良上校是三等残废，右臂活动不灵，他一面忙着指挥，一面也参加抢收。在抢收行列里还有一批军官家属。他们在收割中都是细打细收，保质保量。有一块八十多亩被水淹没的稻田，收割时都是在水中慢慢地摸索着割，割一遍回头检查一遍，不漏掉一棵稻子。经过两天的努力，他们共抢收了稻子一千多亩，还出动车辆帮助公社运粮五万斤。
