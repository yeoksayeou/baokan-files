Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 19th: Gromyko spoke at the first informal meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the 19th. Gromyko pointed out that during the Foreign Ministers' Conference, there had been a beneficial exchange of views on the issues of West Berlin and the establishment of an All-German Committee. He said that despite the differences and difficulties that had arisen, the work completed at the meeting still had some positive significance. The exchange of views made it possible to better clarify the positions of all parties, determine the extent of the differences, and attempt to bring the views of all parties on these issues closer to each other to some extent.

Gromyko said that the Soviet delegation, taking into account the attitude and actual situation of Western countries, put forward new proposals to the conference on June 9th and 10th regarding the Berlin issue and the All-German Committee. We believe that this proposal provides a good basis for resolving these issues.

We regret that Western countries have taken a negative attitude towards our proposals, but we believe that the main opposition of the West to our proposals, regarding the validity period of the temporary agreement on West Berlin and the issue of the All-German Committee, is due to misunderstandings or incorrect understandings of the essence of our proposals.

Gromyko emphasized that the essence of the new Soviet proposal is that, since Western countries are currently unwilling to immediately and completely abolish the occupation regime in West Berlin, the Soviet government agrees not to object to maintaining certain occupation rights of the three Western powers in West Berlin for a certain period. We have proposed drafting an agreement on a temporary arrangement on the issue of West Berlin that is valid for a certain period. At the same time, the All-German Committee should formulate concrete measures in drafting and concluding a peace treaty with Germany and unifying Germany.

It can be seen from this that the essence of the Soviet government's proposal is to gradually eliminate the abnormal state of West Berlin and take measures to draft a peace treaty and unify Germany.

Based on the exchange of views at the meeting, and taking into account the views put forward by Western countries, the Soviet government believes that it is entirely possible to find a mutually acceptable basis for reaching an agreement on the Berlin issue and the All-German Committee.

Gromyko said that the Soviet government believes that the agreement on temporary regulations for West Berlin should include reaching agreement on the following points:

	The reduction of Western countries' occupation forces in West Berlin to a symbolic number;
	The cessation of subversive activities from West Berlin against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries;
	No deployment of atomic weapons and rocket weapons in West Berlin.

Gromyko said that we should first reach agreement on these measures related to West Berlin.

Regarding the validity period of this agreement, it is not a major issue for us, nor is it a matter of principle. The Soviet government's starting point is that the conclusion of peace with Germany and the maintenance of the occupation regime in West Berlin should not be delayed indefinitely. If the one-year period proposed by the Soviet government cannot satisfy Western countries, then an agreement can be reached on other periods acceptable to all parties concerned.

Gromyko said that Western countries proposed a working period of two and a half years for the All-German Committee during the meeting. We proposed one year. Now we must try to find some compromise solution and reach a unanimously agreed solution. We believe that it can be agreed upon for a period of one and a half years. We are convinced that as long as we reach agreement on the main issues of principle, then we will not encounter difficulties in agreeing on the necessary time limit. Within the time limit agreed upon by the participants in the agreement, the two Germanies will implement the relevant measures of the All-German Committee composed of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on an equal basis.

The committee should promote the expansion and development of contacts between the two Germanies, discuss and formulate concrete measures for the unification of Germany, and discuss issues related to the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

The Soviet Foreign Minister said that if within the agreed period, the issues of peace with Germany and the unification of Germany have not been resolved within the scope of the All-German Committee, or in other ways, then the participants in the 1959 Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference can meet again to discuss the West Berlin issue.

During the effective period of the agreement, the existing connections between West Berlin and the outside world will be maintained.

Gromyko said that the Soviet government has pointed out in the proposals put forward on June 9th and 10th that, in order to supervise the implementation of the above-mentioned agreement on temporary regulations for West Berlin by all parties, it is recommended to establish a supervisory committee composed of the four countries of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France.

This proposal of the Soviet government accommodates the wishes expressed by Western countries and is a good basis for reaching a mutually acceptable agreement on the Berlin issue and the All-German Committee issue.

The Soviet delegation also took into account that the positions of Western countries and the Soviet Union have become closer in the discussion process of the conference on many issues involved in this proposal. Here we are referring to these issues, concerning the reduction of armed forces and the non-deployment of atomic weapons and rocket weapons in West Berlin, concerning the cessation of subversive activities, and the need to establish an All-German Committee in order to promote the rapprochement of the two Germanies, help them reunite, and draft a peace treaty with Germany.

Gromyko concluded by saying that the Soviet government hopes that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France will seriously consider the above-mentioned proposals of the Soviet Union and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 19th: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko spoke at the second informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 19th on the statement made by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France read out by Herter. Gromyko said that when talking about the part of the statement of the three Western countries concerning the validity period of the temporary regulations agreement on West Berlin, it insisted that the new Soviet proposal did not change the essence of the matter. However, when we proposed that the validity period of the agreement be one and a half years, we said that on the issue of the time limit, we did not see any difficulties hindering the reaching of an agreement. The period proposed by Western countries is two and a half years, and another period we proposed is one year. We believe that a certain compromise period can be agreed upon, so we proposed a period of one and a half years. We emphasized in this regard that we do not think the issue of the time limit is a major, principled issue. We are convinced that if an agreement is reached on the main issues, then no difficulties will arise on the issue of the validity period of the agreement.

Gromyko said that the statements of the three Western foreign ministers referred to some unilateral actions by the Soviet side. It can be seen from their statements that the three foreign ministers understand the talks of Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev on June 19th and the propositions put forward by the Soviet delegation at the meeting here in this way: it seems that once the validity period of the agreement proposed in the Soviet proposal expires, the Soviet Union will have the freedom to take separate actions. However, our counterparts clearly understand our proposal, and I also talked about this at the first meeting today, that if the All-German Committee fails to reach an agreement on the issues it should discuss within the above-mentioned period, then we propose that the participants of the 1959 Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference can meet again to discuss the issue of Berlin. In other words, we propose to re-discuss the whole issue at a meeting with the participation of the current members of the meeting, that is, to take this issue as the object of discussion like the negotiations being conducted now.

That is our attitude.

It is incomprehensible why, in this case, the issue of the Soviet Union taking certain unilateral actions would be raised.

The three Western foreign ministers also insisted that after the one-and-a-half-year period, when they will have no rights in West Berlin, they will be called to negotiate. Needless to say, they are free to draw this or that conclusion from our proposal, but we have nothing to do with their one-sided interpretation of our proposal. In this proposal, we did not touch upon the rights of Western countries in West Berlin at all. Therefore, the conclusions made in their statements are rash.

We would like to point out that when we put forward our proposal today after consulting with the government of the German Democratic Republic, we expected the proposal to be treated well by the three Western foreign ministers. We believe that their statements just now are only the result of a preliminary understanding of our proposal. We hope that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France will carefully study and consider the proposal of the Soviet government put forward today. We would like to emphasize that the proposal was put forward not to complicate the situation, but to help reach an agreement. We express the hope that this step of the Soviet government will be correctly understood by the governments of the three Western countries.

    葛罗米柯在19日两次外长非正式会议上发言
    西方应该认真对待苏联新建议
    苏联再次努力为谋求协议提供良好基础
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社日内瓦19日讯：葛罗米柯19日在苏、美、英、法四国外长第一次非正式会议上作了发言。葛罗米柯指出，在外长会议的过程中，已经就有关西柏林和建立全德委员会的问题有益地交换了意见。他说，尽管出现了分歧和困难，会议所完成的工作还是有一定的积极意义。各方交换了意见，这就使得有可能更好地阐明各方的立场，确定分歧存在的程度，并且尝试在一定程度上使各方在这些问题上的观点接近起来。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联代表团估计到西方国家的态度和实际情况，在6月9日和10日就柏林问题和有关全德委员会的问题向会议提出了新的建议。我们认为，这个建议为这些问题的解决提供了良好的基础。
    我们感到遗憾的是，西方国家以否定态度对待我们的建议，但是我们认为，西方主要是在关于西柏林临时协定的有效期限和关于全德委员会的问题上反对我们的建议，这种情况是由于误会或者不正确地理解我们建议的实质所造成的。
    葛罗米柯着重指出，苏联新建议的实质在于：由于西方国家目前不愿意立即和完全废除西柏林的占领制度，苏联政府同意不反对在一定期限内保持西方三国在西柏林的某些占领权利。我们曾建议拟定一项在一定期间内有效的关于西柏林问题的临时性安排的协定。同时，全德委员会应当在起草和缔结对德和约以及统一德国方面制定具体的措施。
    由此可见，苏联政府建议的实质在于：逐渐消除西柏林的不正常状态，起草和约和统一德国的措施。
    根据在会议上所交换的意见，并且考虑到西方国家提出的看法，苏联政府认为，完全有可能找到彼此能够接受的基础，来就柏林问题和全德委员会的问题达成协议。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联政府认为，关于西柏林临时法规的协定应当包括就下列几点达成协议：
    西方国家在西柏林的占领军裁减到象征性的数量；
    停止从西柏林对德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家进行颠覆活动；
    不在西柏林设置原子武器和火箭武器。
    葛罗米柯说，我们应当首先就有关西柏林的这些措施达成协议。
    关于这一协定的有效期限问题，对我们来说，不是主要问题，也不是原则性的问题。苏联政府的出发点是，不能无限期地拖延同德国的媾和和保持西柏林的占领制度。如果苏联政府提出的一年期限不能使西方国家满意，那么，可以就有关各方都能接受的其他期限达成协议。
    葛罗米柯说，西方国家在会议过程中提出全德委员会工作期限为二年半。我们提出为一年。现在必须设法寻求某种折衷的方案，并且达成一致同意的解决办法。我们认为，可以商定为期一年半。我们深信，只要我们就主要原则性问题达成协议，那末，在商定必要期限方面将不会遇到困难。在协议参加者商就的期限内，两个德国将执行由德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国在对等基础上组成的全德委员会有关的措施。
    委员会应当促使扩大和发展两个德国之间的接触，讨论和拟定统一德国的具体措施，讨论有关准备和缔结对德和约的问题。
    苏联外长说，如果在商就的期限内，在全德委员会的范围内，或者以另外的方式，没有能够解决关于同德国的媾和与统一德国的问题，那末，1959年日内瓦外长会议的参加国可以再一次聚会讨论西柏林问题。
    在协议的有效期间，将保持西柏林现存的同外界的联系。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联政府在6月9日和10日提出的建议中已经指出，为了监督各方对上述关于西柏林临时法规协议的执行情况，建议成立一个由美、苏、英、法四国组成的监督委员会。
    苏联政府这个建议迁就了西方国家所表示的愿望，并且是对柏林问题和全德委员会问题达成互相可以接受的协议的一个良好的基础。
    苏联代表团同时考虑到，在这个建议所涉及的很多问题上，西方国家和苏联的立场在会议讨论过程中有所接近。这里所指的是这些问题，关于裁减武装部队和不在西柏林设置原子武器和火箭武器问题，关于停止颠覆活动以及必须建立全德委员会以便促进两个德国的接近，帮助它们重新统一和起草对德和约的问题。
    葛罗米柯最后说，苏联政府希望，美、英、法三国政府将会认真对待苏联的上述建议并且达成相互都能接受的协议。
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社日内瓦19日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在外长会议19日第二次非正式会议上就由赫脱宣读的美、英、法三国外长的声明发了言。葛罗米柯说，西方三国这一声明在谈到有关西柏林临时法规协议有效期限的那一部分时硬说，苏联的新建议没有改变事情的实质。然而，当我们提出协议的有效期限为一年半时，我们说过在期限的问题上，我们看不出有什么阻挠达成协议的困难。西方国家提出的期限是两年半，我们提出的另一个期限是一年。我们认为，可以商定某种折衷期限，因此我们提出一年半的期限。我们在这方面强调指出，我们不认为期限问题是主要的、原则性的问题。我们深信，如果就主要问题达成了协议，那么，在协议的有效期限问题上不会产生任何困难。
    葛罗米柯说，西方三国外长的发言说到苏联方面的某种单方面行动。从他们的发言中可以看出，三国的外长是这样来理解苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在6月19日的谈话和苏联代表团在这里的会议上提出的主张的：似乎在苏联建议中提出的协议有效期限一过，苏联就有采取单独行动的自由。但是，我们的对方清楚地了解我们的建议，关于这一点我在今天的第一次会议上也谈过，如果在上述期限内，全德委员会没有就它所应当讨论的问题达成协议，那么，我们建议，1959年日内瓦外长会议的参加国可以重新聚会讨论关于柏林的问题。换句话说，我们建议在有目前会议成员参加的会议上重新讨论整个这个问题，也就是把这个问题作为像现在进行的谈判的讨论对象。
    我们的态度就是这样。
    令人不能理解的是，为什么在这种情况下，竟会提出苏联采取某些单方面行动的问题。
    西方三国外长还硬说，一年半期限过后，当它们将没有权利在西柏林的时候，就会叫它们来谈判。不用说，他们有自由从我们的建议中作出这种或者那种结论，但是我们同他们对我们的建议的片面解释毫无关系。在这个建议中，我们根本没有涉及到西方国家在西柏林的权利。因此，在他们的发言中所作出的结论是轻率的。
    我们想指出，我们今天在提出自己的同德意志民主共和国政府协商过的建议时，预料建议会得到西方三国外长良好的对待。我们认为，他们刚才的发言只是初步地了解了我们建议的结果。我们希望，美国、英国和法国政府将会仔细地研究和考虑我们今天所提出的苏联政府的建议。我们想着重指出，这个建议的提出不是为了使局势复杂化，而是为了有助于达成协议。我们表示希望，苏联政府的这个步骤将会得到西方三国政府正确的理解。
