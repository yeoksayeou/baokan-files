Carrying Medicine Kits to the Countryside
Beijing Medical Personnel Vigorously Support Wheat Harvesting

(Our newspaper dispatch) Reporter Liu Peiheng reports: Just as the labor army in the suburbs of the capital is wielding sickles day and night in the wheat fields, throwing themselves into the battle to seize the wheat, Beijing's medical personnel are also organizing themselves, carrying medicine kits and going deep into the fields to carry out prevention and treatment work, supporting the summer harvest and planting. Their slogan is: Let the labor army be healthy and happily and victoriously complete the task of summer harvest and planting.

Recently, in the golden wheat fields, medical personnel carrying red "cross" medicine boxes can be seen running around. While everyone is working, some of them patrol the wheat fields; others sometimes work alongside them. Fengtai, Changping, and Daxing districts have organized nearly six hundred mobile medical teams, going deep into the fields for prevention, treatment, and education. Tongzhou district has also established health rescue offices, the communes have established health rescue stations, and the production management areas have established health rescue groups, all preparing sufficient medicines.

Many medical personnel in Daxing district, when the labor army rests, carry out health education activities on the edges of the fields or near the drinking water stations. Caiyu People's Commune in this district uses forms such as radio broadcasts, blackboard newspapers, and songs to publicize health knowledge on preventing heatstroke and disease to the masses. They also wrote a skit and performed it in the fields.

The health departments in each district also paid special attention to food hygiene, and they first focused on the hygiene of the canteens. The health departments of Haidian and Changping districts trained more than two thousand cooks, enabling them to understand some preventive knowledge of summer intestinal infectious diseases. During the summer harvest, in order to do a good job in food hygiene, the cooks cleaned the canteens spotlessly, scrubbed the tables, chairs, and cutting boards, and the kitchen knives, chopping blocks, and cutting boards were used for specific purposes, with raw and cooked food strictly separated. Public bowls, chopsticks, and other tableware were also boiled and disinfected. Medical workers also assisted the communes in setting up drinking water stations in the fields. The communes in Changping district also delivered heatstroke medicine and cooked mung bean soup to the fields. According to the Changping District Health Bureau, no cases of heatstroke or dysentery have been found in the three people's communes in this district so far.

    背起药包下农村
    北京医务人员大力支援麦收
    本报讯　记者刘佩珩报道：正当首都郊区的劳动大军，日夜挥动镰刀在麦田里投入夺麦大战的时候，北京的医务人员也纷纷组织起来，背起药包深入田间进行防治工作，支援夏收夏种。他们的口号是：让劳动大军在麦收中身体健康，愉快地胜利地完成夏收夏种的任务。
    近日来，在一片金黄色的麦田里，到处可以发现背着红“十”字药箱的医务人员奔走田间。在大家劳动时，他们有的在麦田里巡回；有的有时还跟班劳动。丰台、昌平、大兴等三个区组织了近六百人的巡回医疗队，深入田间进行防治和宣传。通州区还分别成立了卫生救护办公室，公社成立了卫生救护站，生产管理区成立了卫生救护组，都准备了足够的药品。
    大兴区的许多医务人员，当劳动大军休息的时候，他们在地头上或饮水站旁，开展了卫生宣传活动。这个区的采育人民公社，通过广播、黑板报、歌曲等形式，向群众宣传防暑、防病等卫生知识。他们还编成活报剧，在地头演出。
    各区卫生部门还特别注意饮食卫生，他们首先抓紧了食堂的卫生工作。海淀区、昌平区卫生部门训练二千多名炊事员，使他们了解了一些夏季肠道传染病的预防知识。在夏收期间，炊事员为了作好饮食卫生，把食堂打扫得干干净净，桌椅案板都进行了刷洗，厨房里的菜刀、菜墩、案板，都是专活专用、生熟严格分开。公用碗筷等食具，也煮烫消毒。医务工作者，还协助公社在地头设饮水站。昌平区的各公社还把中暑药和煮好的绿豆汤送到地头。据昌平区卫生局了解，目前这个区的三个人民公社，都没有发现中暑和痢疾。
