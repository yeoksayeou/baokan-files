　　Harbin, June 5th (Report from this newspaper) The Harbin Bearing Factory's four-level cadre (factory-level, workshop, section, and team) meeting, which began in December last year, has been maintained until now, forming a system.

　　The factory's four-level cadre meeting is held twice a month, sometimes three to four times. Each meeting revolves around the production center for a certain period. Leaders "reveal the bottom line" to the cadres regarding the tasks to be completed, the reasons, and the methods. The cadres also reflect to the leaders the difficulties and problems encountered in completing the production tasks. The result of such mutual communication has greatly promoted the completion of production tasks. For example, in the second half of March, the state required the bearing factory to complete the task of producing fifty types of "key" product matching bearings, totaling 236,000 sets, by the end of the month. According to normal production, it would take more than a month to complete this task. After discussion at the four-level cadre meeting and the adoption of the method of shortening the front and fighting annihilation battles, the task was completed as scheduled.

　　At the four-level cadre meeting, because leaders and subordinates meet directly, problems are reflected quickly and resolved promptly. The tool workshop, due to a long-term shortage of high-quality coke for brazing alloy tool heads, had poor quality, and the tool heads often fell off, seriously affecting production. A workshop team leader raised this issue at a four-level cadre meeting. After understanding the situation, the factory leaders allocated two tons of good coke, and the problem of alloy tool head detachment was immediately resolved.

　　At the four-level cadre meeting, various experiences and creations from the masses are also frequently exchanged, including experiences in enterprise management, leadership methods, work methods, and experiences in technological innovation and launching mass movements. These experiences have promptly guided the work of cadres at all levels and promoted the factory's production. For example, the machine tool responsibility system, strengthening night shift scheduling, strengthening apprentice education, and implementing the old workers' responsibility for apprentices' ideology, technology, and safety, have all achieved good results after being promoted throughout the factory.

　　The four-level cadre meeting is also an appraisal meeting. Not only can one introduce one's own experience at the meeting, but also report the outstanding achievements and inventions of workshops, sections, and teams to the conference, which encourages the advanced and urges the backward units and departments. All members attending the meeting, regardless of who they are, can criticize any level of leadership and conduct self-criticism. For example, a cleaner criticized the factory-level and workshop cadres at the meeting for not paying attention to conservation after he picked out 800 sets of races (bearing parts) and some grinding wheels in the factory. This aroused the attention of leaders at all levels, and they mobilized workers in the workshops to strictly implement the management of recycled products and pay attention to the storage of edge materials and leftover materials, and formulated practical and feasible conservation plans.

    哈尔滨轴承厂四级干部会形成制度
    领导与被领导直接见面反映问题快解决也及时
    本报哈尔滨5日电  哈尔滨轴承厂从去年12月开始的四级干部（厂级、车间、工段、小组）会议，一直坚持到现在，形成了一种制度。
    这个厂的四级干部会议，每个月开两次，有时召开三次到四次。每次会议都围绕一个时期的生产中心，领导把所要完成的任务、原因、方法向干部“交底”，干部也把完成生产任务中所遇到的困难和问题反映给领导，这样互相通气的结果，大大推动了生产任务的完成。如在3月下半月，国家要求轴承厂在月底务必完成“重点”产品配套的轴承五十种二十三万六千多套的任务，按正常生产，完成这项任务需要一个多月。经过四级干部会的讨论，并采用缩短战线打歼灭战的方法，结果都如期完成了任务。
    在四级干部会上，由于领导与被领导直接见面，问题反映得快，也解决得及时。工具车间因为长期缺乏优质焦炭烧接合金刀头，质量很差，刀头经常脱落，严重影响生产。车间小组长在一次四级干部会上提出了这个问题，厂领导了解后，调拨了两吨好焦炭，合金刀头脱落问题立刻解决了。
    在四级干部会上，还经常交流来自群众中的各种经验和创造，其中有企业管理的经验，也有领导方法、工作方法的经验，还有技术革新和大搞群众运动的经验。这些经验都及时地指导了各级干部的工作，推动了全厂的生产。如机台责任制、加强夜班调度、加强徒工教育、实行老工人对徒工包思想、包技术、包安全的经验等，在全厂推广以后，都收到很好的效果。
    四级干部会又是评比的会议，会上不仅可以介绍自己的经验，还可以把车间、工段、小组的优异成绩，发明创造向大会报捷，既鼓励了先进，又督促了落后单位和部门。凡参加会议的成员，不管任何人都可以对任何一级领导展开批评和进行自我批评，如清扫工曾就他在厂内拣出八百套套圈（轴承零件）和一些砂轮这件事在会上批评了厂级和各车间干部不重视节约问题，引起各级领导重视，并且发动工人在车间严格执行再制品的管理工作，和重视了对边料、余料的保管，并订出切实可行的节约方案。
