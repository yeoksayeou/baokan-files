Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th - The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement here on the 8th, calling on workers around the world to commemorate June 25th - the ninth anniversary of the Korean War launched by the US imperialists - as an international day of working-class solidarity with the struggle of Korean workers and people for the withdrawal of US armed forces from South Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The World Federation of Trade Unions expressed its firm belief that the growing solidarity of workers and trade unions around the world with the just aspirations of the Korean people will help ease international tensions and establish a zone of peace in the Far East.

The statement also pointed out that under US occupation, the economy of South Korea is in a miserable state, and workers are subjected to shameless exploitation and inhuman persecution.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 8th - The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council today called on national Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees to hold "Korea Day" on June 25th to express support for the just struggle of the Korean people.

In a statement issued today, the Secretariat said that on this day, mass rallies should be widely held to support the Korean people, demand the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, and immediately cease all actions of forcibly "relocating" the Korean people.
