Hebei's Millions of Acres of Cotton Have Strong Plants and Lush Leaves
Taojiang, Hunan, Expands Cotton Fields and Vigorously Grabs Technical Management to Strive for a Bumper Harvest

(Our newspaper Tianjin, 15th dispatch) The more than 14 million mu of cotton in Hebei Province have strong plants and lush leaves. People's Commune members in various regions are carefully managing them in conjunction with the summer harvest and planting to strive for a bumper cotton harvest.

This year, Hebei Province's cotton was sown under conditions of extreme drought. However, after checking seedlings, replanting, and watering to preserve seedlings, they generally grow very well. Currently, the cotton has grown six or seven true leaves and is four or five inches high. Most cotton fields have undergone cultivation and seedling setting. Continuous prevention and treatment of cotton aphids are currently underway, and the system of fixed quotas for work contracted to commune members' production responsibilities and inspection and acceptance is also universally implemented.

According to the *New Hunan Daily* news, Taojiang County, Hunan Province, in accordance with the plan of "trial planting for one year, promotion for two years, and cotton self-sufficiency in three years," has planted 12,456 mu of cotton this year, equivalent to 20 times the sown area in 1957. This county has tightly linked every aspect of cotton planting, from sowing to cultivation and management, and has vigorously grasped cotton planting technology. The cotton fields have basically achieved "three absences": no missing seedlings, no diseases and pests, and no weeds. The cotton is generally growing well, with more than 3,900 mu having seedlings over five or six inches deep, and some high-yield fields are already budding. Currently, more than 90% of the county's professional personnel can prepare land, fertilize, thin seedlings, set seedlings, prevent and control diseases and pests, and cultivate and topdress, greatly increasing their confidence in striving for a bumper cotton harvest.

(Our newspaper Tianjin dispatch) Communes throughout Hebei are meticulously managing cotton seedlings. Before cultivating and setting seedlings, communes in various regions adopted the method of combining leaders, technicians, and commune members to discuss and determine reasonable close planting specifications. Before starting work, production teams consulted with elderly, middle-aged, and young commune members, and discussed the seedling density based on soil fertility, water and fertilizer conditions, and management levels, achieving reasonable close planting adapted to local conditions. During cultivation, seedlings were first thinned and then set, fully selecting and retaining good and strong seedlings. Many places also adopted the advanced experience of staggered seedling retention in three rows (ridges). Some places have experimented with high-ridge cultivation of cotton. Cotton cultivated in this way is thick and strong. In the Wanmu high-yield cotton field in the Daodongbao Management Area of the Chengan Commune in Ci County, 4,000 mu of cotton cultivated on high ridges are taller and have more leaves than cotton in ordinary cotton fields, growing particularly vigorously. According to actual inspection results, the soil temperature of high ridges is one degree higher than that of flat ridges, and the main root of cotton is also about one centimeter longer than that of cotton in ordinary cotton fields, with six or seven more lateral roots.

After the success of large-scale high-yield fields last year, communes have established cotton high-yield fields this year. Many places have done a good job with the cotton in the high-yield fields as a model for ordinary cotton fields, mobilizing commune members to visit and promote careful management of cotton fields. In order to promote commune members to do a good job in cotton field management, the Ningjin County Party Committee organized more than 500 cadres and experienced farmers to visit the Qianmu high-yield cotton field in Xinzaidian in batches. The visitors absorbed the experience of cotton cultivation and seedling setting here, and strengthened the management of cotton fields.

Controlling cotton aphids is an important task in cotton field management. This year, before and after sowing, various places vigorously removed weeds, prevented aphids, and eliminated woody hosts, delaying the occurrence time of cotton aphids. By early June, cotton aphids began to occur one after another. In the control of cotton aphids, many places implemented the "treat one plant, treat a patch; treat a patch, treat a surface" method, striving for thorough treatment. In early June, cotton aphids were discovered in the 44,000 mu of cotton fields in Changguan Commune, Ningjin County. The commune party committee immediately held a meeting to mobilize commune members to eliminate them. With the determination to "treat the severe ones first, then the light ones, treat continuously when there are insects, prevent continuously when there are no insects, not missing a single plant, not letting go of a single insect, and resolutely eliminating aphids," more than 1,800 commune members eliminated aphids from more than 8,200 mu of cotton fields in just two days, ensuring the normal growth of cotton.

In cotton field management, communes universally implemented the production responsibility system of fixed quotas for work contracted to commune members and the inspection and acceptance system to ensure the quality of cotton field management. The 1,100 mu of cotton fields in the Dongbuluoying Production Team of the Heye Commune in Gaocheng County were contracted to 480 commune members by dividing them into groups and plots, and setting measures, quality, time, and work points for each commune member, averaging 2 to 2.8 mu per labor force, and contracting until the cotton stalks were pulled out. To facilitate inspection, the production team also placed wooden signs in the fields. This not only strengthened the management of cotton fields, increased work efficiency, and increased commune members' attendance, but also changed the waste of time when the production team leader used to look for people and commune members used to wait before going to the fields. After the Heye Commune promoted the production team's method, more than 38,900 mu of cotton fields were well managed.

According to the *New Hunan Daily* news, Taojiang County, Hunan Province, absorbed the experience of old farmers and local experts from other places and locally, widely disseminated cotton planting technology, and actively strengthened cotton field management.

Taojiang County is a new cotton area, and most cotton fields are converted from rice paddies. In some places, the soil is clayey. After the cotton seedlings emerged, they encountered continuous rain, and the masses lacked technology and experience, so field management did not keep up, and some cotton seedlings died. In order to quickly reverse this situation, in addition to strengthening specific leadership over cotton production from the beginning, the Taojiang County Party Committee established a cotton production headquarters and each commune organized cotton planting professional teams, and also took various measures to improve the cotton planting technology of cadres and the masses. First, two technical training courses were held, training 392 backbones. Communes also successively trained 940 people, expanding the cotton technology team. Second, 100 local experts with cotton planting experience were hired from old cotton areas such as Shimen, Linli, and Changde to go deep into the cotton area to guide technology, adopting the method of using the field as a classroom, teaching and learning at the same time, and imparting cotton planting technology. Then, on-site visits were organized. Four on-site meetings were held successively from land preparation and fertilization to cultivation, and communes and brigades held five to ten times each, summarizing and exchanging experiences in a timely manner. The cadres of the county planted 103 mu of high-yield experimental fields, taking the lead in everything, creating experience, and promoting it in all aspects. Technicians divided the land into contracted areas, made rounds of inspections to guide technology, and implemented mutual teaching and mutual learning to improve the technical level of cadres and commune members.

While improving cotton planting technology, cotton field management was strengthened to overcome all natural disasters. For example, after cotton aphids and other pests occurred during the continuous rain, the county party committee immediately mobilized from top to bottom, summarized the experience of old farmers and local experts, and mobilized the masses to quickly dig ditches to filter water, ensuring that each plot has a main ditch and each compartment has a branch ditch, so that rainwater is smooth and unobstructed, and the soil dries after the rain stops, so that cotton seedlings do not wither due to waterlogging; at the same time, seize sunny days, cloudy days, and gaps in the rain to carry out surprise cultivation, hoeing weeds and loosening the soil, increasing sunlight and air circulation, and applying hot and fast-acting fertilizers such as burned soil ash and chemical fertilizers to make the soil refreshing, improve the soil temperature; in terms of pest control, adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, manual capture and drug killing, to eliminate cotton field diseases and insect pests in a concentrated manner. Due to the timely adoption of various measures, the moldy rain was overcome, ensuring the smooth progress of field management and promoting the normal growth of cotton seedlings. (Attached picture)

    从上到下钻研技术　田间管理细致踏实
    河北千万亩棉花株壮叶茂
    湖南桃江扩大棉田面积，大抓技术管理力争丰收
    本报天津15日电　河北省一千四百多万亩棉花株壮叶茂，各地人民公社社员正在结合夏收夏种，细心管理，争取棉花大丰收。
    今年河北省的棉花是在土地异常干旱的条件下播种的，但是经过查苗、补苗和浇水保苗后，一般都生长得很好。目前，棉花已生出六、七个真叶，高四、五寸。大部棉田都经过了中耕和定苗。目前正在连续防治棉蚜，还普遍实行定额包工到社员的生产责任和检查验收制度。
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省桃江县按照“一年试种，两年推广，三年棉花自给”的规划，今年种植了棉花一万二千四百五十六亩，相当于1957年播种面积的二十倍。这个县从棉花播种到培育管理，环环扣紧，大抓植棉技术，棉田基本上实现了“三无”：无缺蔸、无病虫害、无杂草，棉花一般生长良好，其中三千九百多亩苗深五、六寸以上，个别丰产田已经现蕾。目前，全县已有90％以上的专业人员会整地、施肥、间苗、定苗、防治病虫害、中耕追肥，争取棉花丰收的信心大增。
    本报天津电　河北各地公社对棉苗管理都很细致。中耕定苗前，各地公社采取领导、技术、社员三结合的办法，商定了合理密植的规格。开锄前，各生产队又与老年、壮年、青年社员座谈，根据土地肥瘦、水肥条件和管理水平等，具体商量了留苗密度，作到了因地制宜的合理密植。中耕时，先疏苗，再定苗，充分选留了好苗、壮苗。许多地方还采用了三行（垅）交错留苗的先进经验。有些地方试行了棉花高垅栽培法。这样培植出的棉花，又粗又壮。磁县城安公社道东堡管理区的万亩棉田丰产方里，有四千亩高垅培植的棉花，比一般棉田的棉花株高叶多，生长得格外茂盛。据实际检验的结果，高垅比平垅地温高一度，棉花的主根也比一般棉田的棉花长一公分左右，旁根多生出六、七根。
    在去年大搞丰产方成功后，今年各公社都搞了棉田丰产方。许多地方把丰产方里的棉花搞好，作为一般棉田的样板，发动社员参观，推动社员们对棉田进行细心的管理。中共宁晋县委为了推动社员做好棉田管理工作，组织干部、老农五百多人，分批参观了新寨店的棉花千亩丰产方。参观的人吸取了这里棉花中耕、定苗的经验，加强了对棉田的管理。
    除治棉蚜，是棉田管理工作中的一项重要工作。今年在播种前后，各地大力除草防蚜消灭木本寄主，推迟了棉蚜的发生时间，到6月初旬，棉蚜才先后发生。在除治棉蚜中，许多地方实行了“有一棵，治一片，有一片，治一面”的除治方法，力求治得彻底。宁津县长官公社的四万四千多亩棉田里，在6月初旬发现了棉蚜，公社党委立即召开会议，发动社员除治。一千八百多名社员本着“先治重、后治轻，有虫连续治，无虫连续防，一棵不漏，一虫不放，坚决把蚜虫消灭光”的决心，只两天时间即除了八千二百多亩棉田的蚜虫，保证了棉花的正常生长。
    各地公社在棉田管理工作中，普遍实行了定额包工到社员的生产责任制和检查验收制度，以保证棉田管理的质量。藁城县河冶公社东不落营生产队的一千一百亩棉田，用按组包块、社员定垅和定措施、定质量、定时间、定工分的办法，分包给四百八十名社员，平均一个劳力负责二至二点八亩，一直包到拔棉柴为止。为了便于检查，这个生产队还在地里插上木牌。这样，既加强了对棉田的管理，工效高，社员出勤多，也改变了以前下地时生产队长找人和社员等人的浪费时间的现象。河冶公社推行了这个生产队的办法后，三万八千九百多亩棉田都管理得很好。
    据新湖南报消息　湖南桃江县吸收外地和本地老农与土专家的经验，广泛传授植棉技术，积极加强棉田管理。
    桃江县是新棉区，棉田多是稻田改种，个别地方土壤又属粘性，棉苗出土后，又连续碰上阴雨，加之群众缺乏技术和经验，田间管理没有赶上来，部分棉苗死亡。为了迅速扭转这种情况，桃江县委除了一开始就加强对棉花生产的具体领导，县委和公社党委分别成立了棉花生产指挥部和各公社组织了植棉专业队，还采取各种办法提高干部和群众的植棉技术。首先办了两期技术训练班，训练出三百九十二个骨干，各公社也相继训练了九百四十人，扩大了棉花技术队伍。其次，从石门、临澧、常德等老棉区，聘请了有种棉经验的土专家一百人，深入棉区指导技术，采取田间当课堂，边教边学，传授植棉技术。然后组织现场参观，从整地施肥到培育，先后召开了四次现场会，公社大队都开了五到十次，及时总结交流了经验。全县干部种了丰产试验田一百零三亩，样样先行一步，创造经验，全面推广。技术人员分地包干，巡回检查指导技术，实行互教互学，提高干部和社员的技术水平。
    在提高植棉技术的同时，加强了棉田管理，战胜一切自然灾害。例如，阴雨连绵中发生棉蚜等虫害后，县委立即从上而下进行动员，总结老农和土专家的经验，发动群众迅速开沟滤水，做到块块有主沟、厢厢有支沟，天雨水流畅通，雨停土干，不使棉苗因渍水而枯萎；同时抓晴天、阴天和钻下雨空隙，突击中耕，锄草松土，增阳光，通空气，追施火土灰、化肥等热性速效肥料，使土爽水，提高泥温；在治虫方面，采取土洋结合、人工捕捉和药杀相结合的办法，突击消灭棉田病虫害。由于各项措施采取得及时，战胜了霉雨，保证了田间管理工作顺利进行，促进了棉苗正常生长。（附图片）
