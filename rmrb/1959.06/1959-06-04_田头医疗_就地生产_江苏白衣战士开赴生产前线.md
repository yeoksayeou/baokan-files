Fieldside Medical Care, On-Site Production
Jiangsu's White-Clad Warriors Head to the Production Frontline

    (Our report) Jiangsu Province's medical personnel are going deep into the countryside, actively supporting the summer harvest and planting.

    Hospitals, epidemic prevention stations, and commune hospitals in various counties are all taking action. The Gaoyou County People's Hospital and Schistosomiasis Prevention Station have transferred twenty medical personnel to organize four technical guidance stations, responsible for providing medical technical guidance during the busy farming season. More than 160 medical personnel from the communes throughout the county have formed mobile teams, dividing areas of responsibility to provide medical care to commune members in the fields. In order to better serve the summer harvest and planting, the Jiangxin Commune Hospital in Zhenjiang recently helped various production teams train a group of acupuncture healthcare workers, helping them learn to use acupuncture to treat common ailments during the busy farming season such as heatstroke, headaches, stomachaches, and back pain. Employees of many pharmacies are also cooperating with doctors to go to the countryside, delivering medicines to patients in a timely manner.

    Medical personnel in various areas are not only doing a good job of labor protection in the fields, but they are also actively helping canteens carry out summer hygiene work. The Yangzhou Gongdao People's Hospital recently sent fifteen doctors to train more than one hundred cooks and accountants for the commune in two days, guiding them on how to conduct canteen management and general heatstroke prevention work. The Jiangpu Shangyou Commune Hospital held an on-site meeting to provide hygiene education to canteen cooks, helping them do a good job of food hygiene and prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal system, so as to ensure the attendance rate of commune members.

    These medical personnel are carrying out medical work on one hand and participating in labor on the other, and are warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commune members. (Attached picture)

    田头医疗　就地生产
    江苏白衣战士开赴生产前线
    本报讯　江苏省广大医务人员深入农村，积极支援夏收夏种。
    各地县医院、卫生防疫站、公社医院等都纷纷行动起来。高邮县人民医院和血吸虫病防治站抽调了二十名医务人员，组织四个技术辅导站，负责农忙期间的医疗技术指导工作。全县公社的一百六十多个医务人员，分别组成巡回组，划区包干，深入田间负责社员的医疗工作。镇江江心公社医院为了更好地为夏收夏种服务，最近还帮助各生产队训练了一批针灸保健人员，帮助他们学会使用针灸治疗农忙中常见的中暑、头痛、胃痛、腰背痛等疾病。许多药店的职工，也都配合医生一起下乡，把药品及时送给病人。
    各地医务人员不仅在田头做好劳动保护工作，他们还积极帮助食堂开展夏季卫生工作。扬州公道人民医院最近派十五名医生，在两天内为公社训练了一百多名炊事员和会计，指导他们如何进行食堂管理和一般防暑工作。江浦上游公社医院召开现场会议，对食堂的炊事员进行卫生教育，帮助他们做好饮食卫生，防止肠胃系统传染病的发生，以保证社员的出勤率。
    这些医务人员在农村一面开展医疗工作，一面劳动，受到了广大社员的热烈欢迎。（附图片）
