    Facial Makeover
      Painting by Danish artist Piet Struys, poem by Yi Heyuan
    Just relying on a knife and scissors,
    Changing faces is not difficult.
    Tell it to change and it changes,
    A skill so powerful, like a deity.
    Only hear the scissors whizzing,
    Hair instantly becomes short;
    A flash of the knife, quick as the wind,
    A tuft of black beard disappears.
    Soap lather covers the head,
    Disguise potion sprayed a few times,
    Take a look in the mirror,
    A new face appears in the mirror.
    The devil incarnate, Hitler,
    Returns to the world through reincarnation,
    His transformed body is called Adenauer,
    Foolishly attempting a resurgence from the ashes! (Attached picture)

    全凭一副刀和剪，
    改头换面不费难，
    叫声变来它就变，
    本领高强赛神仙。
    只听剪子呼呼响，
    头发一下都变短；
    刀子一挥快如风，
    一撮黑胡就不见。
    肥皂沫儿涂满头，
    易容药水喷几遍，
    对着镜子瞧一瞧，
    镜里现出新嘴脸。
    混世魔王希特勒，
    借尸还魂在人间，
    化身叫做阿登纳，
    死灰妄想要复燃！（附图片）
