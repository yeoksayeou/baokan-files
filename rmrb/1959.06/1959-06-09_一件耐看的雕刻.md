    A Durable Sculpture
    Liu Xiaocen
    In the "Exhibition of Modern Bulgarian Sculpture," there is a stone sculpture called "Cleaning Woman" by Lazarov Ivan. It seems like a very ordinary work, but it has a great attraction and becomes more and more intriguing as you look at it. The author portrays the face of an ordinary worker through the daily labor movement of mopping the floor. This person is bending over, her right hand stretched forward with force to mop the floor. She is so focused, serious, and not at all careless. Moreover, the overall composition gives a sense of forward movement. In the artistic treatment, her right sole and heel are firmly planted on the ground, which is the starting point of the power, supporting the body to move forward. The left foot in the middle constitutes the stability of the statue, while breaking the monotonous form of the right hand in front and the right foot in the back, enriching the sense of rhythm in the forward movement. The figure's body is obviously exaggerated, with disproportionate arms, hands, and feet, but the beauty lies in the fact that you feel it is very necessary. Her body is very strong and powerful, but her overall movements are very flexible. The left shoulder of the statue is high, and the right shoulder is low; the left arm is bent, and the right arm is extended. The folds of the clothing are sometimes substantial, sometimes ethereal, sometimes drooping, and sometimes wrapped, all creating subtle contrasts in this movement, making it appear that there is stillness within the movement, making the movement even more pronounced. The knife work of this piece is rough, and the stone under the legs is just left there unfinished and connected to the left heel. The headscarf, face, and other details are a seamless whole, without realistic carving. It looks like it's not finished, but it highlights the effect of the big movement even more, which is very special and unique. It looks particularly simple, but the more you look at it, the richer it becomes. It seems that you can't find the facial expression of the character, but the artist has captured a greater expression in the large dynamics. Because of this, it can immediately attract people's attention. The artist does not shout loudly here, but loudly says very powerful words. Brilliant, truly great skill appears simple.
    A touching sculpture, the most important thing is to see how deeply it reveals the theme, and to see if its artistic attainments have unique features. The reason why this work attracts me is also because it fully utilizes the language of sculpture. The most basic language of sculpture is image and dynamics. If you can't find a typical image or typical dynamics, it's like a dumb person who has language but cannot speak, so it cannot resonate with others. Some comrades can explain their works in a way that is touching and tearful, but when you look at the works, you are not moved. This means that they have not yet found the language of sculpture, have not yet found a touching artistic image, and have not yet found subtle dynamics. Today, being able to see more than thirty original sculptures of different content and styles from the modern Bulgarian art works is truly a valuable learning opportunity. I would like to go and carefully appreciate those works again.

    一件耐看的雕刻
    刘小岑
    在“保加利亚现代造型艺术展览会”中，有一件石雕“女清洁工”，作者是拉札罗夫·伊万。看来这是一件很普通的作品，但却具有很大的吸引力，越看越耐人寻味。作者通过擦地板这一日常的劳动动作，而刻划出一个普通劳动者的面貌，这个人弯着腰右手用力的伸向前方去擦地，她是那样地专注、认真、丝毫也不马虎。而且由于整个的构图结构，能给人一种前进式的感觉。在艺术的处理上，她的右脚掌和脚根都有力地踏在地上，这是动力的起点，它支撑着身体向前运动，而左脚在中间又构成了雕像的稳定性，同时又打破了右手在前右脚在后的单调的形式，而丰富了前进中的节奏感。这个人物的身体很显然是被夸张了，胳膊、手、脚等都显出了不匀称的比例，但是妙在你反而感到非常的必要。她的身体很粗壮有力，但全身的动作又很灵活。雕像的左肩高，右肩低；左臂屈，右臂伸，衣纹也是有虚有实有垂有裹，都给这一运动造成了微妙的对比，显得动中有静，动愈显动。这件作品刀法粗犷，腿底下的石头就那样的塞着没有打完和左脚根连在一起。头巾和脸以及其他细部都是一个浑然的整体，而没有如实的雕琢。看起来好像没有雕完，但是它更突出了大的动作的效果，真是别有味道而独具一格。看起来它特别的简略，但是却越看越丰富。看起来你找不到人物脸部的表情，但是艺术家却抓到了大动态上的更大的表情。正因为如此，所以才能一下子就把人紧紧地吸引住。艺术家在这里没有高声的叫喊，却响亮地说出了非常有力量的话语。高明，真是大巧若拙。
    一件感人的雕刻，首要的是看他对主题思想的深度揭示的如何，是看它的艺术造诣是不是有独到之处。这件作品之所以能吸引我，还因为它充分的利用了雕塑的语言。雕塑最基本的语言是形象与动态。找不到典型的形象，找不到典型的动态，就如同哑吧一样有语难言，因此也无法引起别人的共鸣。有的同志把自己的作品讲解得能够感人落泪，但是看作品时却并不感动人，这就是还没有找到雕塑的语言，还没有找到感人的艺术形象，还没有找到微妙的动态。今天能够看到保加利亚现代造型艺术作品中，三十多件不同内容不同风格的雕塑原作，真是一个可贵的学习机会，我还想再去仔细欣赏那些作品。
