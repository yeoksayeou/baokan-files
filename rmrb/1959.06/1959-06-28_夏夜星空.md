    Summer Night Starry Sky
    Qin Xiao
    On midsummer nights in June and July, when you are cooling off outdoors and gazing at the stars in the sky, do you know what these stars are called? Do you know some of their stories?
    Look! The magnificent Big Dipper hangs high in the northwest sky, its handle pointing due south. "When the handle points south, the world is in summer." The Big Dipper is the seven brightest stars in the constellation Ursa Major. Since ancient times, it has guided travelers and nomads.
    On the northwest horizon, the majestic Leo is gradually setting, but its heroic posture still shines. Regulus is the brightest star in Leo, still shining brightly in the northwest sky. Navigators use it as one of the nine navigational stars.
    In the center of the zenith, slightly west, a bright pearl hangs high: Arcturus in the constellation Boötes is dazzling. The light emitted from this star needs to travel thirty-six years through the distant space to reach Earth.
    To the east of Boötes is the semicircular Corona Borealis, which has a story: In Greek mythology, when the god of wine, Bacchus, held a wedding with a beautiful girl, Ariadne, Bacchus used seven glittering gems to form a brilliant crown for the bride to wear. Unexpectedly, the bride died on her wedding night. In his grief, Bacchus threw the crown into the sky as an eternal memorial. The crown became the glorious constellation Corona Borealis in the starry sky.
    The gauze-like Milky Way rises higher and higher, running from the northeast of the sky to the south. The constellations Aquila and Lyra are located on the east and west banks of the Milky Way, respectively. Altair and Vega look at each other across the banks. Thanks to the constellation Cygnus in the northeast, a magpie bridge is formed, allowing the Cowherd to fly across on the seventh night of the seventh month to pour out his longing to the Weaver Girl. Look, Cygnus is flying above the Milky Way, and Altair, with the two flanking stars, looks like it is rushing to leap forward!
    In recent months, the dazzling Venus has appeared in the northwest sky, west of Leo. At dusk, in the southern sky, another bright star is vying with Venus for beauty: this is Jupiter. It is now in the constellation Scorpio (Shangsu). The constellation Scorpio has a magnificent shape, like a scorpion. In Scorpio, there is a red star, which our ancestors called Antares, also known as Dà Huǒ.
    When the night is quiet and late, Saturn emerges from the southeastern horizon. Saturn has a beautiful ring, which makes it famous all over the world. It is now in Sagittarius. Sagittarius is the Dǒusu of the Twenty-Eight Mansions. Niúsu, also known as Capricorn, is also east of Sagittarius. The six stars of Nandou are the main bright stars of Sagittarius. Look: the north and south stars are both in the south and in the north, facing each other from afar, how can one not feel how cleverly nature has arranged it?
    Each year the scenery is better than the last. This year's summer night sky features Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn appearing simultaneously, which is a rare opportunity. The ancients regarded this celestial phenomenon as an auspicious year. In early July, Mercury will appear in the northwest sky in the glow of the sunset, and Mars will appear west of Venus, emitting red light. This star, which is of great interest to people, and may still have advanced life, along with the other four major planets, is offered as "Five Stars Present Auspiciousness" to herald a bountiful year!

    夏夜星空
    秦晓
    6、7月仲夏之夜，当你在户外纳凉，凝望天空中点点繁星的时候，你可知道这些星星都叫什么名字？你可知道她们的一些故事？
    看吧！那雄伟的北斗七星高挂西北天空，斗柄正指南方。“斗柄指南，天下皆夏”了。北斗星是大熊星座中的七颗最亮的星，自古以来，它为旅行家，游牧人作了响导。
    西北地平线上雄壮的狮子座正在逐渐西沉，然而英姿依然焕发。轩辕十四是狮子座最亮的星，仍在西北天空大放光彩，航海家把它作为航海九星之一。
    天顶正中偏西，一颗明珠高悬，牧夫座的大角星晶光夺目。从这颗星发出来的光需要在遥遥太空中旅行三十六年才能到达地球。
    在那牧夫座东边半圆形的北冕座，有着那么一段故事：希腊神话中的酒神巴卡斯，和一位美丽的姑娘亚利特尼举行婚礼的时候，巴卡斯用七颗晶莹的宝石，结成一顶灿烂的华冠给新娘戴上，不料新婚之夜，新娘就死了。巴卡斯悲痛之余，把华冠抛向空中作为永恒的纪念。华冠在星空中就变成了光辉的北冕星座。
    轻纱般的银河越升越高，从天空东北奔向南方。天鹰星座和天琴星座分别在银河的东岸和西边。牛郎星和织女星在两岸遥遥相望，多亏东北方向的天鹅星座作成鹊桥，才能使牛郎在七夕飞渡而过，去到织女那里倾叙阔别相思之情。你看，那天鹅座飞翔在银河上面，牛郎星和两旁的扁担星，正显出一副急追飞跃之状哩！
    近几个月里，天空西北出现了光彩夺目的金星，它在狮子座西边。黄昏时候，正南方天空，另一颗亮星却要与金星争妍斗艳，这就是木星。它现在在天蝎星座（商宿）。天蝎星座有一个壮丽的形状，像一只蝎子。在天蝎座中有一颗红色星星，我们祖先叫它做心宿二，也名大火。
    当夜静更阑的时候，土星从东南方地平上出来了。土星有着一个漂亮的光环，这就使它名扬四海。它，现在在人马星座。人马座就是二十八星宿中的斗宿。牛宿即摩羯星座也在人马座东边。南斗六星就是人马星座主要亮星。请看：南北两星斗，一在南来一在北，遥遥相对，怎么不使人感到大自然安排得多么巧妙呢？
    一年佳景胜一年，今年的夏夜星空，金，木，水，火，土五颗星同时出现了，这是很难得的机会。古人把这种天象当成是祥瑞的年头。在7月上旬，水星将出现在西北天空晚霞光辉里面，火星出现在金星西面，放出红光。这一颗使人们极感兴趣，可能至今还有高级生命存在的火星，也和其他四颗大行星一起，作为五星献瑞，以兆丰年！（附图片）
