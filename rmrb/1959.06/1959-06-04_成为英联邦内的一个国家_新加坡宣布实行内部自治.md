Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd dispatch from Singapore: Singapore became a state within the Commonwealth with internal self-government starting from 00:00 this morning.

    The first British High Commissioner to Singapore, Goode, was sworn in today and will exercise the functions of head of state for six months after Singapore achieves internal self-government. Goode, as the British Governor of Singapore, announced the proclamation regarding Singapore's internal self-government at 20:15 local time on the evening of the 2nd.

    According to the new Singapore Constitution, promulgated in the name of the Queen by the British government in November last year, which came into effect today, Singapore was originally scheduled to implement internal self-government on the first Monday after the legislative assembly elections on May 30—i.e., June 1. The reason for this postponement is that the People's Action Party of Singapore, which won the ruling party status in this election, demanded that the British authorities release the arrested leaders of the party as a condition for accepting the invitation to form a new government. British Governor Goode agreed yesterday to release the eight leaders of the party.

    It is announced that the People's Action Party government will take office on June 5.

    According to the new constitution, after Singapore achieves internal self-government, Britain will continue to control Singapore's foreign affairs and defense, continue to retain its military bases in Singapore, and control Singapore's "internal security" affairs through an "Internal Security Council." The British government also retained the power to dissolve the Singapore Legislative Assembly and suspend the implementation of the Singapore Constitution in the name of the Queen. The first British High Commissioner to Singapore retained the power to intervene in Singapore's internal affairs, including the circumstances of cabinet meetings.

    成为英联邦内的一个国家
    新加坡宣布实行内部自治
    新华社3日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡从今天上午零时开始成为英联邦内的一个实行内部自治的国家。
    第一任英国驻新加坡高级专员古德已经在今天宣誓就职，他将在新加坡实现内部自治后的六个月内行使国家元首的职权。古德在2日晚上当地时间二十时十五分，曾经以新加坡的英国总督的身份宣布了关于新加坡实行内部自治的公告。
    根据今天生效的、英国政府于去年11月以女王名义颁布的新加坡新宪法，新加坡原定在5月30日立法议会举行选举后的第一个星期一——即6月1日实行内部自治。这个日期被推迟的原因是：在这次选举中取得执政党地位的新加坡人民行动党要求英国当局释放这个党的被捕的领袖，以此作为接受组织新政府的邀请的条件。英国总督古德在昨天同意释放这个党的八位领袖。
    据宣布，人民行动党政府将于6月5日就职。
    据新宪法规定，在新加坡实现内部自治以后，英国将继续控制新加坡的外交和国防，继续保留它在新加坡的军事基地，并且通过一个“内部治安委员会”来控制新加坡的“内部治安”事务。英国政府还保留了以女王名义宣布解散新加坡立法议会和停止实施新加坡宪法的权力。第一任英国驻新加坡的高级专员则保持了过问包括内阁会议情况在内的新加坡内部事务的权力。
