Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 2nd June: Anshan Iron and Steel's steel army achieved a complete victory across the board in Red May. The entire company's output of major products such as steel, pig iron, steel products, coke, sintered ore, and iron ore all exceeded the state plan for May.

Since the beginning of the year, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee have focused on increasing the production of raw materials, which has led to a steady increase in pig iron production, with a more significant increase in Red May. Pig iron production in May increased by 9% compared to April, creating the highest monthly pig iron production record in history. Steel production also increased steadily, with May increasing by 5.3% compared to April. Compared with the state plan, the actual output in May exceeded the plan by more than 12,200 tons of steel, more than 4,100 tons of pig iron, more than 26,400 tons of steel products, more than 29,200 tons of sintered ore, and more than 6,300 tons of coke. The quality of various products has also generally improved compared with April. Among them, the pig iron qualification rate increased by 0.26%, reaching 97.12%; the steel qualification rate increased by 0.7%, reaching 97.44%; and the first-class steel product rate increased by 2.45%, reaching 92.29%. Steel production in May increased by 50.5% compared with the same period last year, and pig iron production increased by 36.1% compared with the same period last year.

In May, workers on all fronts of Anshan Iron and Steel, including steelmaking, ironmaking, steel rolling, coking, and mining, launched a vigorous competition to learn from and catch up with advanced units to achieve high quality and high yield. After unifying the technical guiding ideology of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers, the ironmaking plant quickly launched a mass competition, with ten large blast furnaces resembling ten brothers, chasing each other and refusing to give way. In early May, the average utilization coefficient of the No. 3 blast furnace reached 2.17, defeating its strong opponent, the No. 9 blast furnace, and winning the championship. Not willing to be outdone, the No. 9 blast furnace held a meeting overnight to analyze and study the situation, and worked hard to catch up. In mid-May, the average utilization coefficient jumped to 2.201, regaining the honorary title of the factory's red flag furnace. Both blast furnaces completed the May pig iron production plan ahead of schedule. In May, the average utilization coefficient of all blast furnaces in the ironmaking plant reached 1.64, an increase of 0.142 compared with April. After the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee and the Party Committees of various steelmaking plants vigorously promoted the advanced experience of No. 6 open hearth furnace in maintaining the furnace body in mid-May, a mass movement to learn from and catch up with advanced units in furnace protection was immediately launched among more than 20 large open hearth furnaces, which gradually increased the operating rate of open hearth furnaces and steadily improved the production level. Workers in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant strengthened furnace maintenance work, improved furnace repair quality, and shortened the furnace repair period. In mid-May, the effective operating rate of open hearth furnaces increased by 6.6% compared with the first ten days of the month. The No. 2 Steelmaking Plant strengthened the maintenance of the furnace body. From the 16th to the 20th, the effective operating rate of all ten open hearth furnaces in the plant increased by 1.56% compared with the first half of May, and the average daily steel production exceeded the state plan by 268 tons.

Now, the workers of various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel, based on the complete victory in Red May, have confidently投入了(tou ru le) themselves into the battle of June. They expressed that they must continue to work hard, advance victoriously, and overfulfill the steel production plan for the second quarter and the whole year.

Shanghai Iron and Steel

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd June: The high-quality and high-yield competition launched by the workers on the Shanghai steel front in Red May has achieved brilliant results. The city's steel production in May increased by 17.29% compared with April, and the steel qualification rate remained above 96.7%.

Entering May, various provinces and cities transported a large amount of good pig iron to Shanghai, which greatly encouraged the workers of Shanghai's steel enterprises. The workers in each factory closely focused on the weak and key points in production, and successively broke through key problems such as raw material management, cupola furnace age, and converter furnace age, and the daily steel production increased steadily. Especially in extending the life of the converter, each factory promoted the operating method of "steelmaking and furnace refining" created by Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, so that the average furnace life of the city's converters increased from more than 20 furnaces in April to about 40 furnaces.

New production records continued to appear in various steel plants in May. From the 23rd to the 31st, the average daily output of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant was 1,066 tons, an increase of 28.1% compared with the average daily output in the first half of the month. The newly built Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant last year, in the second half of May, due to learning from the experience of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant in extending the life of the furnace, the daily steel output rose rapidly from about 300 to 400 tons to more than 570 tons, and the highest daily output reached 1,053 tons. Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant (fixed furnace seat), whose converter utilization coefficient has been leading the country for several months, further improved its production level this month, with a utilization coefficient of 16.13.

Wuhan Iron and Steel

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd June: In May, the output and quality of pig iron, coke, and ore of Wuhan Iron and Steel created the highest records since it was put into production. The pig iron output of No. 1 blast furnace exceeded the state plan by 2,466.3 tons, and the average pig iron qualification rate reached 96.1%; the coking plant completed the monthly plan of producing 90,000 tons of coke ahead of schedule on the 30th, and the drum index of coke strength averaged above 320 kilograms, and the ash content of coke was also reduced to the required index; Daye Iron Mine increased ore production by more than 10,000 tons compared with the original plan, and the amount of powder ore was greatly reduced compared with the past.

Among them, pig iron was 100.3%, steel was 104.4%, steel products were 102%, and metallurgical coke and refractory materials also exceeded the planned targets. The quality of various major products has been significantly improved.

The successful situation of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in May was obtained on the basis of extensively carrying out the increase production and conservation campaign with improving quality as the center. While carrying out a major quality inspection, the workers of each factory took measures to improve product quality in every possible way. The workers of the open hearth furnace section of the No. 2 Steel Plant took a series of measures in response to the opinions of users on the quality of steel ingots, and the workers of the mold making and gas sections also established a mass supervision network. Therefore, the qualified rate of steel ingots in the plant in May reached 98.35%, an increase of 5.72% compared with April.

Chongqing Iron and Steel

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd June: In May, although the major overhaul of large open hearth furnaces and converters of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company took up more than 400 hours of production time, the average daily steel output of the entire company still increased by 16.4% compared with April; the average daily output of steel products increased by 3.13% compared with April. While the output increased, the quality of steel in the entire company also greatly improved. Compared with April, the steel qualification rate increased by 3.85%, and the steel product qualification rate increased by 5.67%. Since May, in addition to taking measures to further solve the problem of high sulfur and shorten the smelting time, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has also strengthened the maintenance of the furnaces, effectively ensuring the increase of furnace output and furnace utilization coefficient.

Shijingshan Iron and Steel

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd June: In May, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled the national plan for steel, iron, coking, and cast pipe in all aspects; the output and quality of steel and iron were improved compared with the previous month.
