Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 1st: As of May 28th, Anhui Province had already purchased 38.84 million jin of rapeseed. The rapeseed purchase volume is still increasing daily, with the province's daily intake into warehouses nearing 10 million jin.

This year, Anhui Province achieved a general bumper harvest of rapeseed. Inspired by the bumper harvest, commune members in various places are enthusiastically selling their rapeseed to the state. Many people's communes, after completing the state's rapeseed purchase tasks, are also selling their surplus rapeseed to the state.

The Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province attach great importance to the rapeseed purchase work, and each level of the Party committee has a secretary specifically responsible for it. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the former Guangde County comprehensively deployed the work of harvesting, threshing, purchasing, and transporting rapeseed, organizing labor to rush to thresh and dry rapeseed during the day, and organizing labor to rush to deliver rapeseed at night. When rapeseed was being brought to the market in the suburbs of Anqing City, it coincided with continuous rainy days. The Anqing Municipal Party Committee and the Suburban District Party Committee mobilized commune members to rush to harvest day and night, and also drew more than 300 people from government offices and schools to help the communes with rapeseed threshing work. While harvesting and threshing rapeseed, they also mobilized the communes to sell it in a timely manner. As a result, the city's 1.4 million jin rapeseed purchase task was overfulfilled on May 23rd.

    安徽大收大购油菜籽
    社员欢庆丰收踊跃出售　每天入库量近一千万斤
    新华社合肥1日电　安徽省到5月28日止，已经收购油菜籽三千八百八十四万斤。油菜籽收购量现在仍在逐日增加，全省每天的入库量近一千万斤。
    今年，安徽省油菜籽普获丰收，各地人民公社社员在大丰收的鼓舞下，都踊跃地把油菜籽卖给国家。不少人民公社在完成国家的菜籽收购任务以后，还把多余的菜籽卖给国家。
    安徽省各级党委对油菜籽的收购工作非常重视，各级党委都有一个书记专门负责。原广德县在党委统一领导下，全面部署了油菜籽的收、打、购、运工作，白天组织劳力突击脱粒、翻晒，晚上组织劳力突击送菜籽。安庆市郊在菜籽登场时，适逢连日阴雨，中共安庆市委和郊区区委发动公社社员日夜抢收，并从机关、学校中抽出三百多人帮助公社搞菜籽脱粒工作，在收打菜籽的同时，又动员公社及时出售，结果全市一百四十万斤菜籽收购任务，在5月23日就超额完成。
