    The Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Food Jointly Propose Measures to Increase Oil Production
    Increase Oil Yield, Find More Oil Sources
    (Our newspaper dispatch) In order to process all oilseed crops in a timely manner during the rapeseed season, the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Food recently convened a national rapeseed oil processing and production conference in Xindu County, Sichuan Province, to study and formulate a series of measures to process existing oil materials in a short period of time.
    The conference analyzed the current situation of oil production and raw material supply. It was believed that this year's abundant rapeseed harvest has created favorable conditions for increased oil production. Currently, new rapeseed has been put on the market in large quantities, so doing a good job in purchasing and processing will play a decisive role in completing the edible oil production task for the third quarter.
    The conference pointed out that in order to ensure the completion of oil production tasks, all rapeseed, except for a portion reserved for seeds, must be purchased. The fourteen provinces and cities that mainly produce rapeseed must complete a production plan of more than 310,000 tons of vegetable oil in the third quarter, so as to ensure that all oil materials controlled by the communes and the state are fully squeezed.
    The conference believes that in order to ensure higher oil yields, it is first necessary to strengthen cooperation between industry and commerce. Local light industry departments and oil factories should, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, allocate a certain amount of manpower to cooperate with the food and commercial departments in doing a good job in purchasing, so as to achieve simultaneous purchasing, allocation, and processing. At the same time, attention should also be paid to cooperation with agriculture, and the oil cakes from urban oil factories should be transported back to the countryside in a timely manner to solve the needs of agricultural fertilizer.
    The conference believes that launching a mass movement to increase production and conserve resources with "double high, double low" (high oil yield, high output, low cost, low residual oil rate in dry cake) in oil production is an important key to increasing oil production. It is required that all localities complete the technical transformation of indigenous pressing, semi-mechanization, and mechanization before the end of the year. The oil yield of rapeseed is required to increase by 1% to 5% on the existing basis, and the residual oil rate in the dry cake of rapeseed should be reduced to below 5% to 6.5% for machine pressing and below 6.5% to 8% for indigenous pressing. Compared with the same period last year, costs are required to be reduced by 10% this year. The conference believes that many advanced experiences have now been created in this regard in various localities, and certain results have been achieved. In machine pressing, Kunshan Oil Factory in Jiangsu Province achieved a high moisture content steaming embryo, with an oil yield of 34.87% (rapeseed oil content 35.98%), exceeding the target. In terms of technological innovation in indigenous pressing, hydraulic, animal-powered, and other semi-mechanized pressing tools created in Sichuan, Guizhou, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces have also been successful. Among them, the No. 1 Oil Pressing Factory in Xindu County, Sichuan Province, increased its output by 50% and produced one to two more jin of oil per hundred jin of rapeseed due to changing manual pressing to hydraulic pressing. These experiences should be seriously promoted.
    The conference attached great importance to the work of opening up oil sources, pointing out that the fourteen provinces that currently produce rapeseed, in addition to grasping the production of new rapeseed oil this year, should also pay attention to cold-pressed soybeans and wild oil materials. Other potential sources, such as aquatic animal oil, corn germ, and silkworm pupa oil, can also be tapped. There are still a considerable number of early-maturing peanuts and autumn rapeseed in various localities. Rice bran is also an important new oil source. In addition, some provinces still have rapeseed that has not been squeezed from last year, and there is also a surplus of peanuts used for seeds, and there is still a certain amount of cotton seeds and sesame in stock. Therefore, the conference believes that as long as oil sources are fully organized, there is a material basis for overfulfilling the production task for the third quarter.
    Representatives attending the conference included 197 representatives from the light industry, food, commerce, and some oil factories in fourteen provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Hubei, Sichuan, Henan, and Guangdong.

    轻工业部粮食部联合提出增产油脂措施
    提高出油率多多找油源
    本报讯　为了在油菜籽上市季节把所有的油料作物都及时加工出来，轻工业部和粮食部最近在四川省新都县召开了全国菜籽油加工生产会议，研究和制定了在短时期内加工完现有油料的一系列措施。
    会议对今年油脂生产与原料供应情况作了分析。认为今年油菜籽丰收，为油脂增产创造了有利条件。目前，新菜籽已大量上市，因此，作好收购和加工工作，对完成第三季度食油生产任务，将起决定性的作用。
    会议指出，为了保证油脂生产任务的完成，当前菜籽除留种的一部分以外，必须全部收购上来。全国主产油菜的十四个省、市，三季度必须完成三十一万多吨的植物油生产计划，做到把公社和国家掌握的油料全数榨完。
    会议认为，为了保证多出油，首先必须加强工商协作，要求各地轻工业部门和油厂，在当地党委统一领导下，抽调一定的力量，配合粮食和商业部门做好收购工作，做到边收购、边调拨、边加工。同时，还应注意和农业的协作，把城镇油厂的油饼及时运回农村，以解决农业用肥需要。
    会议认为，展开油脂生产中的“双高双低”（提高出油率、提高产量，降低成本、降低干饼残油率）的群众性增产节约运动，是油脂增产的重要关键。要求各地应在年底以前全部完成土榨半机械化、机械化技术改造。菜籽出油率要求在现有基础上提高1％至5％，菜籽干饼残油率机榨分别降到5％至6.5％以下，土榨达到6.5％至8％以下。与去年同期相比，要求今年成本降低10％。会议认为，现在各地已在这方面创造了许多先进经验，收到一定的效果。机榨中江苏昆山油厂高水分蒸胚，出油率达到34.87％（菜籽含油率35.98％）超额完成了指标。在土榨技术革新方面，四川、贵州、江苏、浙江等省创造的水力、畜力以及其他半机械化压榨工具，也都获得成功。其中四川新都县第一榨油厂由于改人力打榨为水力打榨，产量提高50％，每百斤菜籽多出油一至二斤。这些经验应该认真推广。
    会议对开辟油源的工作十分重视，指出目前生产菜籽的十四个省份，除抓紧今年新菜籽油的生产以外，对冷榨大豆和野生油料也要重视起来。其他如水产动物油、玉米胚芽、蚕蛹油也有潜力可挖。各地早熟花生和秋菜籽数量还不少。米糠也是重要的新油源。此外，去年有的省菜籽还没有榨完，同时留种用的花生还有多余，棉籽和芝麻还有一定的存量。因此，会议认为，只要充分组织油源，超额完成三季度生产任务是有物质基础的。
    参加这次会议的代表有江苏、上海、浙江、湖北、四川、河南、广东等十四个省、市的轻工业、粮食、商业和部分油厂的代表共一百九十七人。
