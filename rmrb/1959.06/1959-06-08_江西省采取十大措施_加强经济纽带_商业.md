Nanchang, This Daily — June 7th: In implementing the policy of giving equal importance to industry, agriculture, and commerce, the commercial departments of Jiangxi Province have taken measures to invigorate commodity circulation and vigorously promote the development of industrial and agricultural production. In the first five months of this year, the province's total commodity purchases increased by 23.4% compared with the same period last year, and the total sales increased by 50.8% compared with the same period last year, thereby ensuring the supply of industrial raw materials and agricultural production materials and meeting the needs of the people's lives.

Since the beginning of this year, industrial and agricultural production has placed more arduous tasks on commercial work than last year. In order to adapt to this new situation, Party committees at all levels in Jiangxi have taken timely measures to strengthen leadership over commercial work ideologically and organizationally, so that commerce and industry and agriculture are given equal importance, and the enormous role of socialist commercial work is fully utilized. On the one hand, all localities have universally strengthened specific leadership over commercial work, designated party and government leading members to specifically lead the commercial front, and established and improved commercial institutions; on the other hand, ideological education has been strengthened for commercial workers, so that the broad masses of workers further recognize that the development of production and commercial circulation are an inseparable whole, and neither is dispensable. On this basis, commercial departments throughout Jiangxi Province have extensively carried out the "Six Goods" red flag movement (good at promoting production, good at implementing policies, good at completing plans, good at financial management, good at service quality, and good at advancing towards redness and expertise) centered on increasing production and practicing economy, vigorously promoted industrial and commercial cooperation, agricultural and commercial cooperation, and actively promoted industrial and agricultural production and organized the people's economic life. At the end of March and the beginning of April, on the basis of reviewing and summarizing the industrial and commercial cooperation in the first quarter, the provincial commercial departments and light industrial departments, through industrial and commercial discussions, made unified arrangements for the amount of raw materials needed and the supply plan of light industrial factories in the second quarter. Of the 224 kinds of materials required by the light industrial sector, the supply problems of 141 kinds of materials have been solved; the remaining 83 kinds of materials are also being organized by the commercial sector from all aspects to find sources of goods and substitutes. In supporting agricultural production, national commercial departments and people's communes have universally signed purchase and sales contracts, and held material exchange fairs, which not only supplied the people's communes with the means of production they needed, but also stimulated the development of diversified economies in the people's communes. In the current season of summer harvest and summer planting, commercial departments throughout the province have sold 40,000 sickles, 25,000 dan of grain baskets, 40,000 carrying poles, 12,000 dan of earth baskets, and more than 37,000 hoes, plows, and harrows, and timely supplied the people's communes with the tools they needed for summer harvest and summer planting.

In order to further improve commercial work and earnestly implement the policy of giving equal importance to industry, agriculture, and commerce, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Commerce recently convened a provincial meeting of commercial directors and bureau chiefs to summarize past experiences and put forward ten measures to improve commercial work: First, do everything possible to do a good job in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, local and special products, and waste products, to achieve more purchases, quick purchases, good purchases, and sufficient purchases, to collect all usable materials, and actively organize transfer and transportation, and transport them to industrial and mining enterprises in a timely manner to ensure the supply of industrial raw materials and promote the development of industrial production. Second, promote the contract system, hold material exchange fairs, further invigorate urban and rural trade, and promote the development of diversified economies in the communes. Third, carry out production and sales cooperation with reclamation farms and farms, actively assist reclamation farms and farms to overcome difficulties in production, do a good job in the supply of seeds and means of production, and promptly do a good job in the purchase of forest by-products and local and special products. Fourth, make overall arrangements for rational distribution, so that agricultural production materials are given priority to ensure rural needs, and industrial production materials are given priority to ensure the needs of key construction projects. Fifth, restore the Market Management Committee and establish a new set of market management systems to strengthen the management of the market and invigorate the rural market. Sixth, improve the commercial institutions of the communes, strengthen the political and ideological leadership and business and technical guidance of the commercial departments of the communes, and give full play to the positive role of the commercial departments of the communes. Seventh, comprehensively carry out a movement to clear inventory commodities and working capital, tap the potential of commodities, overcome extravagance and waste, and accelerate capital turnover. Eighth, in terms of export materials, ensure that arrangements are made first, production is first, raw materials are supplied first, purchases are made first, and transportation is first, to ensure the completion of tasks on time, with good quality, and in sufficient quantity. Ninth, strengthen the leadership of storage and transportation work, organize professional transportation teams in the communes, strengthen short-distance transportation forces, and do a good job in dedicated line transportation. Tenth, further carry out the "Six Goods" red flag movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy, mobilize all positive factors, and promote the entire commercial work.

    江西省采取十大措施
    加强经济纽带——商业
    本报南昌7日电 江西省商业部门贯彻工农商并举的方针，采取措施活跃商品流通，大力促进工农业生产的发展。今年头五个月中，全省商品购进总额比去年同期增长23.4％，销售总额比去年同期增长50.8％，从而保证了工业原料与农业生产资料的供应和人民生活的需要。
    今年以来，工农业生产对商业工作提出了比去年更加繁重的任务。为了适应这种新形势，江西各级党委及时采取措施，从思想上组织上加强对商业工作的领导，使商业与工农业并举，充分发挥社会主义商业工作的巨大作用。一方面，各地普遍加强了对商业工作的具体领导，指定党政领导成员专门领导商业战线，并建立和健全了商业机构；另一方面，加强了对商业职工的思想教育，使广大职工进一步认识发展生产与商业流通是不可分割的整体，两者缺一不可。在这个基础上，江西全省商业部门广泛开展了以增产节约为中心的“六好”红旗运动（促进生产好、执行政策好、完成计划好、金融管理好、服务质量好、向红专进军好），大搞工商协作，农商协作，积极推进工农业生产和组织人民经济生活。3月底4月初，全省商业部门与轻工业部门在检查总结了第一季度工商协作工作的基础上，又通过工商两家座谈，对于轻工业工厂第二季度原材料的需用量和供应计划作了统一安排。轻工业部门提出的二百二十四种物资要货计划中，有一百四十一种物资的供应问题得到了解决；其余八十三种物资也正由商业部门从各方面组织货源和寻找代用品。在支持农业生产方面，国家商业部门与人民公社之间普遍签订了购销合同，并且举办了物资交流会，既供应了人民公社所需的生产资料，又刺激了人民公社多种经济的发展。在目前夏收夏种季节中，全省商业部门已经销售了镰刀四万把、谷箩二万五千担、扁担四万根、土箕一万二千担、锄头犁耙三万七千多件，及时供应了人民公社对夏收夏种工具的需要。
    为了进一步做好商业工作，认真贯彻工农商并举的方针，江西省商业厅最近召开了全省商业处长局长会议，总结了过去的经验，提出了做好商业工作的十大措施：一、千方百计做好农副产品、土特产品和废品的收购工作，做到多收快收收好收足，把一切可以利用的物资全部收起来，并积极组织调运，及时运到工矿企业，以保证工业原料的供应，促进工业生产的发展。二、推广合同制度，开好物资交流会，进一步活跃城乡贸易，促进公社多种经济的发展。三、开展与垦殖场、农场的产销协作，积极协助垦殖场、农场克服生产上的困难，做好种籽和生产资料的供应，并及时做好林副土特产品的收购工作。四、全面安排合理分配，做到农业生产资料优先保证农村需要，工业生产资料优先保证重点建设需要。五、恢复市场管理委员会，建立一套新的市场管理制度，以加强对市场的管理，活跃农村市场。六、健全公社的商业机构，加强对公社商业部门的政治思想领导和业务技术指导，充分发挥公社商业部门的积极作用。七、全面开展一个清理库存商品和流动资金运动，挖掘商品潜力，克服铺张浪费，加速资金周转。八、在出口物资方面，做到安排在先、生产在先、供应原材料在先、收购在先、运输在先，保证按时按质按量完成任务。九、加强对储运工作的领导，在公社中组织专业运输队，壮大短途运输力量，搞好专线运输工作。十、进一步开展以增产节约为中心的“六好”红旗运动，把一切积极因素都调动起来，推动整个商业工作。
