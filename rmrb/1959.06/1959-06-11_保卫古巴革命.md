Defend the Cuban Revolution
Cuban People's Socialist Party Chairman Juan Marinello

I am very happy to be able to talk about the situation in Cuba in Beijing. Our people will not forget the continuous support given to us by the People's Republic of China during the difficult days of opposing the Batista tyranny, nor will they forget the moving gatherings held in some major cities of the People's Republic of China to celebrate the victory of our people. We have an unavoidable responsibility to express our gratitude to the Chinese government and people for the fraternal support they gave us during our days of struggle and victory.

We should try to briefly explain the characteristics of the Cuban situation, the dangers it faces, and its future prospects.

On the first day of 1959, democratic and progressive people around the world warmly and excitedly congratulated the victory of the Cuban people. This victory overcame the bloody tyranny of Batista, who consistently relied on the support of US imperialism. The insurgent forces led by Fidel Castro were composed of the people, with a considerable proportion of farmers and working people with various ideas, so the island of Cuba had all the conditions to achieve revolutionary change. The development of the Cuban situation proves this point.

In the days following the victory of the Cuban Revolution, the People's Socialist Party assessed this victory and its characteristics. Our party believes that the failure of Batista and imperialism means a shift in the class in power. The most reactionary pro-imperialist group in the Cuban bourgeoisie (i.e., Batista's supporters and accomplices) has been defeated, and now in power are representatives of the radical petty bourgeoisie and progressive elements in the Cuban bourgeoisie. Our party also pointed out the unusual situation that, for the first time in its history, the Republic of Cuba has a government that was produced by the will of the people, not imposed by imperialism. The People's Socialist Party fulfilled its responsibility by pointing out that this government can and should fulfill its tasks.

The five months of the insurgent forces ruling Cuba undoubtedly mark a profound revolutionary change and the most important change in Latin America in recent years. This can be illustrated by citing the most important measures of the Fidel Castro government. Due to the existence of large US sugar planters, the Cuban economy has developed abnormally and is in an extremely difficult state. Therefore, land reform is the most important issue for such a country. Currently, land reform is being implemented on a large scale, and it has become a major key to the development of the Cuban Revolution. On this issue, there is a fierce conflict between the interests of the people and the interests of imperialism. Urban rents have been greatly reduced. The current Cuban government has bravely faced the issue of racial discrimination in Cuba and reduced the prices of telephones, electricity, and medicine, which are controlled by US monopolies. A people's army, based on the insurgent forces that overthrew Batista in the past, has been organized. Democratic principles have been maintained, and people have the freedom to express all ideas. Cuban communists conduct open activities, set up many offices, and the party's newspaper "Hoy" is published in its own newspaper office.

In this positive situation, some contradictions and rifts have also occurred, which are of concern to world democratic public opinion today. Many people ask us: Will the unusual hope that the Cuban Revolution foreshadows for Latin America today be dashed? We should answer this question specifically.

It cannot be denied that those groups keen on splitting the Cuban Revolution have not given up. They are carrying out splitting activities from within and outside the leadership organs of the political organization led by Fidel Castro, namely the "July 26th Movement." Comrade Roca answered sharply at the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the People's Socialist Party to Castro's own speech, which was influenced by the evil spirit of division, which should be eradicated quickly. As Comrade Roca pointed out in his speech, now is the time for the people to unite against the fierce attacks of imperialism and its Cuban agents, not to split the forces opposing Batista. Indeed, now is the time to move the land reform forward and to deploy the people's armed forces to counter the widespread conspiracies planned by the US government to undermine the Cuban Revolution.

Since the victory of the struggle against Batista, imperialism has spared no effort in trying to destroy the Cuban Revolution. Imperialists know that it is very difficult to attack the Castro government domestically in Cuba now, and whoever attacks it will be immediately sanctioned by public opinion. Therefore, they are trying their best to prepare a huge provocation. There is a lot of evidence in this regard, and the People's Socialist Party has told the people. The US government still maintains notorious agents like Colonel Knight in Cuba, as well as despicable reporters like Dubois (who was driven out of Venezuela by Venezuelan democrats), who are secretly carrying out sabotage and splitting activities. But the main activity of the US government is to instigate the reactionaries and oppressors of other Latin American countries to oppose Cuba. For example, it used the so-called "aggression" of Panama to agree with Trujillo, the bloody dictator of the Dominican Republic, to spread lies that Castro was interfering in the internal affairs of countries in the Caribbean region and carrying out subversive activities in these countries. Now, Somoza, the heinous dictator of Nicaragua, is asking the "Organization of American States" to intervene in Nicaragua and save him from the impact of the revolution. As I expected, Somoza is doing his best to spread rumors that the forces opposing his tyranny are communists and were incited by Fidel Castro. All this is in harmony with the requirements of US Senator Mathers and his most reactionary partners to organize a gendarmerie commanded by the "Organization of American States" (that is, by the United States) to "maintain order in the Caribbean region."

The Cuban government's unwavering implementation of land reform has greatly annoyed imperialism. They will not sit idly by as Cuba defeats the tyranny they supported, will not sit idly by as Cuba restores democratic rights, national sovereignty, and takes important measures to develop the national economy to improve the living standards of the masses.

In the face of this situation, there is only one course of action: domestically, all people's forces need to unite closely and bravely to realize the basic slogan of the People's Socialist Party, namely "defend the revolution and move it forward"; internationally, we hope that all democratic and progressive people will clearly understand the significance of the events taking place in Cuba and give effective support to the Cuban people.

Cuba only asks to solve its own problems in accordance with its own interests and the will of the nation, that is, to control its own economy, distribute land to farmers, develop its own industry, improve education, reduce living expenses, consolidate the democratic system, and ensure progress. Internationally, Cuba hopes to establish effective and reasonable relations with the people of all countries in the world in accordance with its excellent revolutionary tradition. Cuba demands to smash the chains that bind it to the US market and demands to promote the growth of the national economy through universal trade with countries around the world. The Cuban people welcome with excitement and gratitude the recent statement by Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China (Note: refers to the "Government Work Report"). This statement expresses the policy pursued by the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union to support and cooperate with the people of all countries striving for national independence. While cheering for this statement, we once again state that we believe that Mao Zedong's great country will continue to give the Cuban people the support they need and deserve for their revolutionary struggle.

On January 1, 1959, imperialism was defeated in Cuba; but it is still trying to stage a comeback from its defeat. Now, the awakening of the Cuban people and the new upsurge of the Latin American liberation struggle are building a strong barrier to block the current offensive of imperialism. Imperialism is being surrounded by the victorious ranks of the socialist world and the struggles of the colonial people. It continues to suffer serious defeats in the Americas. It is at this time that it should be attacked from all sides so that it cannot continue its plunder and oppression. The Cuban people know that they are fulfilling their responsibilities in this common cause and know that they will surely receive the support of the people of all countries.

    保卫古巴革命
    古巴人民社会党主席  胡安·马里内略
    我能在北京谈谈古巴局势，感到非常高兴。我国人民不会忘记在反对巴蒂斯塔暴政的艰难的日子里，中华人民共和国不断给我们的支持，也不会忘记中华人民共和国的一些主要城市为了庆祝我国人民的胜利而举行的动人的集会。我们有不能推诿的责任来对中国政府和人民在我们战斗和胜利的日子里所给予我们兄弟般的支持表示感谢。
    我们应该尽量简要地说明古巴局势的特点、它面临的危险以及它的前途。
    1959年的头一天，全世界的民主和进步人士都热情而兴奋地祝贺古巴人民的胜利。这个胜利战胜了一贯依靠美帝国主义支持的巴蒂斯塔血腥暴政。菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导的起义部队是由人民组成的，其中农民和有各种思想的劳动人民占相当大的比重，因此，古巴岛有着实现革命变革的一切条件。古巴局势的发展，正是证明这一点。
    在古巴革命胜利后的几天内，人民社会党就对这个胜利和它的特点作了评价。我们党认为，巴蒂斯塔和帝国主义的失败，意味着政权中的阶级的转移。古巴资产阶级中最反动的亲帝国主义集团（即巴蒂斯塔的支持者和同谋者）已经被打败了，现在掌握政权的是激进的小资产阶级的代表和古巴资产阶级中的进步分子。我们党也指出了这样一种不平常的情况，即古巴共和国在自己的历史中第一次有了一个由人民意志产生的、而不是由帝国主义强加的政府。人民社会党尽自己的责任，指出了这个政府能够而且应该实现自己的任务。
    起义部队统治古巴的五个月，无疑地标志着一次深刻的革命变革，也是近年来拉丁美洲所发生的最重要的变革。只要举出菲德尔·卡斯特罗政府最重要的措施，就可以说明这一点。由于存在着美国大糖业庄园主，使古巴经济畸形发展，并陷于极困难状态。因此，对于这样一个国家说来，土地改革是最重要的问题。目前，土地改革正在大规模地实施，它已经成为古巴革命发展的重大关键问题。在这个问题上，人民利益同帝国主义利益发生了剧烈的冲突。城市房租大大地降低了。古巴现政府人员勇敢地正视了古巴的种族歧视问题，减低了掌握在美国垄断组织手中的电话、电力和医药的价格。一支以过去推翻巴蒂斯塔的起义部队为基础的人民军队已经组织起来。民主原则已经保持下来，人们也有了表达一切思想的自由。古巴共产党人进行公开的活动，设有许多办公处，党的机关报“今日报”在自己的报馆中出版。
    在这个具有积极意义的形势中，也发生了一些为今天世界民主舆论所关心的矛盾和裂痕。许多人都问我们：古巴革命今天对拉丁美洲预示的那种不平常的希望会落空吗？我们应该具体回答这个问题。
    不能否认，那些热中于分裂古巴革命的集团，并没有甘休。他们正在从菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导的政治组织——即“7月26日运动”派——的领导机关内部和外部进行分裂活动。罗加同志在人民社会党最近一次中央全会上，一针见血地回答了卡斯特罗本人由于受分裂的邪气的影响而发表的讲话，这种邪气应该迅速根除。正如罗加同志在他的发言中所指出的，现在是人民团结起来反对帝国主义及其古巴代理人的猛烈进攻的时候，而不是分裂反对巴蒂斯塔的力量的时候。的确，现在正是使土地改革向前发展的时候，是部署人民武装来反对美国政府为破坏古巴革命而策划的广泛阴谋的时候。
    自反对巴蒂斯塔的斗争获得胜利之日起，帝国主义就不遗余力地企图摧毁古巴革命。帝国主义分子知道，目前要在古巴国内攻击卡斯特罗政府是很困难的，谁去攻击它，谁就会立刻遭到公众舆论的制裁，因此他们竭力在准备一次巨大的挑衅活动。在这方面有很多证据，人民社会党都告诉了人民。美国政府在古巴还保持着像奈特上校那样臭名远扬的特务，以及像杜布阿（他曾被委内瑞拉民主人士赶出委内瑞拉）那样卑鄙的记者，这些人正在暗中进行捣乱和分裂活动。但是美国政府的主要活动，是策动拉丁美洲其他国家的反动派和压迫者来反对古巴。例如，它利用所谓“侵略”巴拿马的事件，同多米尼加共和国血腥独裁者特鲁希略商定，散布卡斯特罗干涉加勒比海地区国家内政和在这些国家进行颠复活动的谎言。现在，尼加拉瓜的可恶的独裁者索摩查，要求“美洲国家组织”干涉尼加拉瓜，把他从革命的冲击下拯救出来。正如我所意料到的，索摩查竭力散布谰言，说反对他的暴政的力量是共产党人，是菲德尔·卡斯特罗煽动起来的。这一切同美国参议员马瑟斯和他的最反动的伙伴提出关于组织一支由“美洲国家组织”（也就是说由美国）指挥的宪兵队来“维持加勒比海地区的秩序”的要求，正是一唱一和。
    古巴政府坚定不移地实行土地改革，使得帝国主义大为恼火。他们不会坐视古巴打败了它们所支持的暴政，不会坐视古巴恢复民主权利、国家主权和采取发展国民经济以改善群众生活水平的重要措施。
    面对这种情况，只有一条行动路线：在国内，需要一切人民力量紧密而勇敢地团结起来，实现人民社会党的基本口号，即“保卫革命并使它向前发展”；在国际上，希望一切民主、进步人士明确了解在古巴正在发生的事件的意义，并给古巴人民以有效的支援。
    古巴只要求按照自己的利益和民族的意志来解决自己的问题，即掌握自己的经济，把土地分配给农民，发展本国的工业，改进教育事业，降低生活费用，巩固民主制度和保证进步。在国际上，古巴希望能按照自己的优秀的革命传统，同世界各国人民建立有效而合理的关系。古巴要求粉碎把它束缚于美国市场的锁链，要求通过普遍地同世界各国贸易，来促进民族经济的成长。古巴人民以激动而感激的心情，欢迎中华人民共和国总理周恩来最近的声明（按：指“政府工作报告”）。这一声明表达了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国所执行的支援争取民族独立的各国人民并同他们合作的政策。在为这一声明而欢呼时，我们再一次的表明：我们相信毛泽东的伟大国家将继续给古巴人民以他们革命斗争所需要和应得的支持。
    1959年1月1日，帝国主义在古巴被打败了；但是它还企图从它的失败中卷土重来。现在，古巴人民的觉醒和拉丁美洲解放斗争的新的高涨，正筑起一道强大的壁障，来阻挡帝国主义当前的进攻。帝国主义正在被社会主义世界的胜利行列和殖民地人民的斗争所包围。它在美洲不断遭到严重的失败。正是在这个时候，应该从四面八方打击它，使它不能继续它的掠夺和压迫。古巴人民知道，在这个共同事业中他们正在尽自己的责任，也知道他们一定会得到各国人民的支援。
