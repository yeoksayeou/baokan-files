Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 15th. A large-scale mass meeting to "Defend the Policies of the Kerala Government" was held in Old Delhi on the evening of the 14th. This marked the end of the "Kerala Week" held in the Indian capital. According to the "Times of India," Dange, leader of the Communist Party parliamentary group in the People's Chamber, said at the meeting that the Kerala government's only "fault" was that it was fulfilling its promises to the voters and enacting laws to improve the lives of ordinary people. Dange said that if all opposition forces "want to use violence to overthrow the constitutionally elected Kerala government, then we will retaliate."

During "Kerala Week," several street rallies in support of the Kerala government were held in Delhi, especially in the working-class districts.

In Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, a mass meeting was also held on the 13th to support the Kerala government. Ahmed, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of India, spoke at the meeting. The resolution passed by the meeting condemned the "lawless and communal agitation launched in Kerala."

In West Bengal, more than 300 educators signed a statement supporting the Kerala Education Act and condemning the opposition's forced closure of private schools. The "Hindu" reported that Kalappan, former leader of the Congress Party and the Common Prosperity Movement, also opposed the use of violence to close schools and launch agitations. He believed that overthrowing the ruling party was unconstitutional and that such issues should be decided by the people.

    德里举行群众大会
    支持喀拉拉邦政府
    新华社新德里15日电　14日晚间在旧德里举行了一次“保卫喀拉拉邦政府的政策”的大规模群众大会。在印度首都举行的“喀拉拉邦周”至此宣告结束。据“印度时报”报道，人民院共产党议会党团领袖丹吉在大会上说，喀拉拉邦政府唯一的“过错”就是，它正在履行它向选民作出的保证，并且制订法律来改善普通人的生活。丹吉说，如果一切反对势力“要用暴力来推翻根据宪法选出来的喀拉拉邦政府的话，那么，我们将进行报复”。
    在“喀拉拉邦周”内，在德里市特别是工人区里，曾经举行多次关于支持喀拉拉邦政府的街头集会。
    在北方邦的首府勒克瑙，13日也举行了群众大会来支持喀拉拉邦政府，印度共产党书记处书记艾哈迈德在会上发表了讲话。大会通过的决议谴责“在喀拉拉邦发动的目无法纪的、教族的煽动运动”。
    在西孟加拉邦，有三百多位教育工作者在一项关于支持喀拉拉邦教育法和谴责反对派强使私立学校关门的声明上签名。“印度教徒报”报道，国大党和共同繁荣运动的前领袖卡拉潘也反对使用暴力来关闭学校和发动煽动运动。他认为，推翻执政党是违反宪法的，这种问题应当由人民来决定。
