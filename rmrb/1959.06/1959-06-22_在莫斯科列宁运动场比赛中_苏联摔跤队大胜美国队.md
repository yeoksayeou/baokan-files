Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 21st: The Soviet freestyle wrestling team decisively defeated the American national team by a score of seven to one last night at the Lenin Stadium here.

This competition was held under the Soviet-American cultural agreement. Last year, the Soviet team visited the United States and won all four matches with a score of twenty-six to six. According to the agreement, the American team is returning to the Soviet Union this year.

Many wrestlers on the Soviet team have been replaced this year, and they all achieved outstanding results, winning all weight classes except for the lightest weight class, for a total of eight classes.

Most of the members of the American team are this year's American champions. They underwent two months of special training before coming to the Soviet Union to compete, but once the competition started, it was clear that the American side was at a disadvantage. In a featherweight match, Soviet athlete Musheyev lifted American champion Hock into the air and flipped him over within fifty seconds, resulting in Hock's defeat with his back on the ground. In the lightweight competition, twenty-three-year-old Soviet athlete and 1957 world champion Bestayev flipped this year's American champion, Koepel, who has fifteen years of wrestling experience, onto his back on the ground near the last minute (eleventh minute) of the match. At this time, the audience applauded to congratulate Bestayev on his victory.

American three-time champion and lightest weight class wrestler McCann competed against Soviet athlete Zamyatin for twelve minutes, and the referee judged McCann as the winner. The American team will also compete against the Russian Federation team, the Ukrainian team, and the Georgian team in Leningrad, Kiev, and Tbilisi.

    在莫斯科列宁运动场比赛中
    苏联摔跤队大胜美国队
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联自由式摔跤队20日晚上在这里的列宁运动场以七比一绝对优势击败美国国家队。
    这次比赛是根据苏美文化协定而举行的。去年苏联队访问美国，四次比赛都取得胜利，比分是二十六比六。根据协定，美国队今年回访苏联。
    今年苏联队中更换了很多选手，他们都作出了出色的成绩，在一共八个等级的比赛中，取得除最轻量级以外所有等级比赛的胜利。
    美国队的队员多数是美国今年冠军，来苏联比赛之前，曾进行过两个月的专门训练，但一上场比赛，显然看出美方处于劣势。在次轻量级一场比赛中，苏联运动员穆谢江在五十秒钟之内就把对手美国冠军赛获奖者霍克腾空抱起翻倒，霍克背部着地失败。在轻量级比赛中，二十三岁的苏联选手、1957年世界冠军别斯塔耶夫在比赛接近最后一分钟（第十一分钟）时把有十五年摔跤历史的今年美国冠军柯普耳背部着地翻倒在地上，这时全场响起掌声，向别斯塔耶夫表示祝贺胜利。
    美国三次冠军获得者、最轻量级选手麦坎同苏联选手扎米亚廷比赛了十二分钟，由裁判员评为胜利者。美国队还将在列宁格勒、基辅和第比利斯三地同俄罗斯联邦队，乌克兰和格鲁吉亚队进行比赛。
