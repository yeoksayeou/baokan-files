To rapidly restore and increase the production of daily necessities to meet the needs of the people is a pressing task for the industrial sector at present. To achieve a significant increase in the production of daily necessities in a short period, it is currently essential to effectively address the difficulties faced by the daily necessities industry due to a shortage of raw materials. The daily necessities industry requires a wide variety of raw materials, including not only pig iron, steel, non-ferrous metals, and chemical raw materials, but also various resources from agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. To ensure increased production of daily industrial products, materials supply departments in various regions are doing their utmost to supply raw materials. However, in addition to this, it is necessary to mobilize the masses of workers to explore potential in every possible way and to fully and rationally utilize existing raw materials. Since the beginning of this year, the daily necessities industry in Shanghai has also encountered serious difficulties due to a shortage of raw materials. However, with the assistance of commercial departments, scientific research institutions, and the people of the city, they have tapped into the enormous potential of raw materials from five aspects: comprehensive utilization, rational use, economical substitution, recycling and reuse, and waste utilization. As a result, they have increased the production of a large number of daily necessities. Shanghai's practice provides useful experience for industries producing daily necessities to explore and maximize the use of raw materials.

After the construction of the first Five-Year Plan and the achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year, our country's material strength has greatly increased. However, compared to the enormous needs of our 600 million people, our material resources are still weak. Therefore, when undertaking various endeavors, we should consider the most effective utilization of existing material resources. It should be recognized that our material utilization rate is still very low, the existing material strength has not played its due role, and the potential is still very large. Many resources that can and should be utilized have not yet been utilized. Therefore, it is not only necessary but also highly promising to cherish every bit of raw material with careful calculations and maximize its effectiveness. Our country's coal production has caught up with that of the United Kingdom, but compared to advanced industrial countries, the effective utilization rate of coal is still very low because most of our coal is used as fuel without comprehensive utilization. Taking Shanghai as an example, if all residents of the city could use gas instead of coal briquettes, the annual civilian coal consumption could be reduced by about one-third compared to the present, saving tens of thousands of train carriages and a large number of loading and unloading equipment as well as transportation manpower. At the same time, the comprehensive utilization of coal can also yield a large number of raw materials for manufacturing nitrogen fertilizer, plastics, fragrances, and Western medicine, increasing the value of coal many times over. Another example is the national annual circulation of newspapers, weighing more than 500,000 tons, while the actual recovered waste newspapers are less than 10%. This shows that the methods of comprehensive utilization, rational use, economical substitution, recycling and reuse, and waste utilization of raw materials, as practiced in Shanghai according to different conditions, are worth greatly promoting throughout the country.

Perhaps some people feel that collecting waste paper, wood shavings, rags, coal ash, wastewater, scraps, etc., is "picking up trash." This understanding is obviously incorrect. On the contrary, this is an important work that is beneficial to society and advantageous to the people. Even if social productivity is further developed, such work will still be indispensable. In the process of socialist construction, thrift must be practiced at all times. Waste utilization should not be regarded merely as an expedient measure to solve the current shortage of raw materials. When science and technology were underdeveloped, some things were indeed waste, but today, after solving the technical problems of comprehensive utilization, the "waste" of the past often becomes treasure. Fully utilizing these "wastes" can not only greatly increase social wealth but also greatly advance our country's production technology level. In the past, coal ash was only regarded as garbage, but today's science and technology can not only use it to extract aluminum but also to extract other valuable raw materials. Therefore, factories that have not yet fully utilized raw materials must first change their views on waste materials, scraps, etc., regard them as the wealth of the entire society, and regard the "making the most of everything" of raw materials as an important topic in the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, and as an important direction for improving industrial production levels and technical levels.

Comprehensive utilization, waste utilization, and other methods of fully utilizing raw materials require a certain level of science and technology and production equipment. Some of these projects, such as replacing coal briquettes with gas and implementing comprehensive coal utilization, require large-scale capital construction and can only be realized in individual areas with suitable conditions at present. However, according to Shanghai's experience, the vast majority of materials can be effectively utilized by combining indigenous and foreign methods. For example, in the comprehensive utilization of petroleum, the Shanghai Refinery has only installed some simple equipment and has already increased more than sixty new products. In this regard, scientific research departments should actively implement the policy of serving production, going down to factories and workshops, and working with the workers to solve production technology problems and production equipment problems. In order to fully utilize various raw materials, it is also necessary to organize extensive cooperation between industries and factories. Various regions and related industries need to establish leading organizations for material utilization, regulate and allocate waste scraps, and organize division of labor, cooperation, and technical exchanges among factories. Factories and enterprises should also promote the spirit of cooperation, and any raw materials that they do not need but are urgently needed by other factories should be extracted as much as possible. Scraps and waste materials that are not needed by the factory but are urgently needed by other fraternal factories should be actively collected and supplied. Commercial departments should extensively carry out publicity and organizational work for waste recycling, and recover all usable materials as much as possible for industrial production. Local government offices, schools, people's organizations, and neighborhood organizations should also carry out mass movements for waste recycling like Shanghai, assisting factories and commercial departments in recovering waste materials.

To achieve "making the most of everything," it is also necessary to rectify and improve local industries nationwide. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, various regions have developed a large number of local industries and people's commune industries based on the principles of using local materials and adapting to local conditions. Some local industries and people's commune industries have begun to get on track in terms of production management and production technology, but there are also many local industries and people's commune industries whose production management is very unsound and whose production technology is very poor. Some use raw materials irrationally, and some have very poor product quality. Of course, these are shortcomings that are difficult to completely avoid in development. However, if this situation is not rapidly changed, it will undoubtedly cause a great waste of raw materials. In particular, some county-run and commune-run local industries and commune industries, such as small-scale indigenous soap factories, use a large amount of oil that can be used to produce high-quality soap, but instead produce low-quality soap that is of very poor quality, and cannot extract important by-products such as glycerin. Similar county-run and commune-run enterprises that have conflicts with modern large-scale enterprises in terms of raw materials should, from the overall perspective, stop production, reduce the waste of raw materials, and supply raw materials to modern factories, so that the use of raw materials is more rational and can play a more effective role.

The current difficulty of insufficient raw materials in the daily necessities industry is a difficulty in progress. Difficulties are contradictions, and contradictions are always there. Without contradictions, there would be no development and no progress. Therefore, whether a cause can advance and whether production can develop does not depend on whether there are difficulties and the size of the difficulties, but on whether people can understand the law of the development of contradictions, conduct specific analysis of specific contradictions, and thus take appropriate countermeasures to resolve contradictions and overcome difficulties. To do this, there should be correct methods, but more important is the mental state of people towards difficulties. If one is not energetic and retreats at the sight of difficulties, it is impossible to correctly understand contradictions, let alone overcome difficulties. Shanghai's daily necessities industry is the largest in the country, and the number of raw materials required is very large, so the difficulties they encounter are also very large. However, the workers in Shanghai put forward the slogans of "making the most of everything," "not leaking a drop," "not wasting a bit," "no waste gas in the sky, no waste water on the ground, no waste materials on the ground," went all out, and tried every means to overcome the difficulties of raw materials, and increased the production of a large number of daily necessities, showing the revolutionary's spirit of not fearing difficulties. It is precisely because of this revolutionary spirit that they not only saw the unfavorable side of the work, but also saw the favorable side. They found enormous material potential in a fish scale, a handful of wood shavings, a corner of iron sheet, and a wisp of smoke. If the cadres and workers engaged in the daily necessities industry in all parts of the country have such aspirations, are full of energy, and are full of drive, they will surely be able to rapidly restore and greatly increase the production of daily industrial products in a short period of time, and meet the growing needs of the people's lives.

    物尽其用
    迅速恢复和增加日用品生产以满足人民需要，是工业部门当前的一项迫切任务。要使日用品生产在短时间内有较大的增长，目前必须很好地解决日用品行业原料、材料不足的困难。日用品行业需要的原材料的品种很多，除了生铁、钢材、有色金属、化工原料之外，还包括农、林、牧、副、渔等各种资源。为了保证日用工业品的增产，各地物资供应部门正在尽可能地供应原料、材料，但是，除此而外，还必须动员职工群众千方百计地挖掘潜力，充分合理地利用现有的原料、材料。上海市日用品行业今年以来也遇到了原料、材料不足的严重困难，但他们在商业部门、科学研究机关和全市人民群众的协助下，从综合利用、合理使用、节约代用、回收重用、废物利用五个方面挖掘原材料的巨大潜力，因而增产了大量的日用品。上海市的做法，为生产日用品的行业挖掘和最大限度地利用原料、材料，提供了有用的经验。
    我们国家经过第一个五年计划的建设，又加上去年大跃进的成就，物资力量虽然大大增加了，但同我国六亿人口巨大的需要相比较，物力还是薄弱的。因此，我们在举办各种事业的时候，应该考虑到最有效地利用现有的物力。应该看到，我们的物资利用率还很低，现有的物资力量还没有发挥应有的作用，潜力还是大得很。许多可以利用应该利用的资源，我们还没有利用起来。因此，精打细算地珍惜一点一滴的原料、材料，发挥它们的最大效用，不仅非常必要，而且大有可为。我国煤炭产量已经赶上英国，但同先进的工业国家相比，煤的有效利用率还很低，因为我国煤炭大多作为燃煤，并未综合利用。以上海为例，如果全市居民都能用煤气而不用煤球，全年民用煤就可以比现在少用约三分之一，就可节约上万个火车车皮和大批装卸设备以及搬运人力。同时，煤炭的综合利用，还可收到大量的制造氮肥、塑料、香精、西药的原料，使煤的价值提高许多倍。又如全国每年发行的报纸，重量在五十万吨以上，而实际收回的废报纸还不到10％。由此可见，像上海那样，根据不同条件进行原料、材料的综合利用、合理使用、节约代用、回收重用、废物利用的办法，值得在全国大大推广。
    也许有人觉得收集废纸、木屑、破布、煤灰、废水、下脚等等，是“拣破烂”。这种认识显然是不正确的。相反，这是一种对社会有益对人民有利的重要工作。即便是社会生产力再发展，也少不了这样一种工作。社会主义建设的过程中，任何时候都必须节约。不应该把废物利用只当做解决当前原料、材料困难而采取的一种权宜的措施。在科学技术不发达的时候，有些东西确是废物，但在今天，在解决了综合利用的技术问题之后，过去的“废物”往往变成了宝物。把这些“废物”充分利用起来，不但可以大大增加社会的财富，还能使我国的生产技术水平大大前进一步。煤灰过去只是当作垃圾，但现在的科学技术不仅能用它提炼铝，还可提炼出其它贵重原料。因此，凡是还没有对原料、材料充分利用起来的工厂，必须首先改变对废料、下脚等等的看法，把它们当做整个社会的财富，把原料、材料的“物尽其用”当做增产节约运动中的重要课题，当做提高工业生产水平和技术水平的一个重要方向。
    综合利用、废物利用等等充分利用原料、材料的方法，需要有一定的科学技术水平和生产设备。其中某些项目，例如不用煤球改用煤气，实行煤的综合利用等等，需要有较大规模的基本建设，当前还只有在个别有条件的地区才能实现。但根据上海市的经验，极大多数的物资都可以用土洋结合的办法来加以有效的利用。如在石油的综合利用方面，上海炼油厂只是装置了一些简易设备，就增加了六十多种新产品。在这方面，科学研究部门应该积极贯彻为生产服务的方针，下工厂，下车间，同工人群众一道解决生产技术问题和生产设备问题。为了充分利用各种原料、材料，还必须在行业之间、工厂之间组织广泛的协作。各地区和各有关行业有必要成立物资利用的领导机构，调剂和分配废料下脚，组织各厂分工协作和技术交流。各工厂企业也应发扬协作精神，凡是自己不需要而其他工厂迫切需要的原料，应该尽可能地加以提取。凡是本厂不需要而其他兄弟厂迫切需要的角料、废料，应该积极地收集供应。商业部门要广泛地开展废物回收的宣传工作和组织工作，尽可能把一切可以利用的物资回收起来，供应工业部门生产之用。各地机关、学校、人民团体、里弄组织，也要像上海市一样，开展废物回收的群众运动，协助工厂和商业部门回收废料。
    要做到“物尽其用”，还必须在全国范围内整顿、提高地方工业。去年大跃进以来，各地根据就地取材、因地制宜的原则发展了大量的地方工业和人民公社工业。有些地方工业和人民公社工业，在生产管理和生产技术上有些已经开始走上轨道，但是也还有不少地方工业和人民公社工业的生产管理很不健全，生产技术很差，有的使用原料、材料不合理，有的产品质量很差。当然，这些是发展中难于完全避免的缺点。但是，这种情况如果不迅速加以改变，无疑将造成原料、材料的很大浪费。特别是有些县和人民公社办的地方工业和公社工业，如小型的土法肥皂厂，大量使用可制质量很好的高级肥皂的油料，但制成的却是质量很坏的低级肥皂，而且还不能提炼甘油等重要的副产品，类似这样的县办和社办的企业，在原材料方面与现代化大型企业有矛盾的，应该从全局观点出发，停止生产，减少原料、材料的浪费，并把原料供应现代化的工厂，使原料的使用更加合理，更能有效地发挥作用。
    当前日用品行业原材料不足的困难，是前进中的困难。困难，也就是矛盾，而矛盾是永远有的，没有矛盾，就没有发展，没有进步。因此，事业能不能前进，生产能不能发展，并不决定于有没有困难和困难的大小，而是取决于人们是否能够认识矛盾发展的规律，对具体的矛盾进行具体分析，从而采取适当的对策来解决矛盾，克服困难。要做到这一点，应该有正确的方法，但更重要的还是人们对待困难的精神状态。精神不振，一见困难就退避三舍，是不可能正确认识矛盾，更不能克服困难的。上海市日用品行业是全国规模最大的，需要原材料为数很大，因而他们所遇到的困难也是很大的。但上海的职工们提出“物尽其用”、“一滴不漏”、“一点不废”、“天上无废气、地下无废水、地上无废料”的口号，鼓足干劲，千方百计地克服原料、材料的困难，增产大量的日用品，表现了革命者的不怕困难的志气。正由于这种革命者的志气，他们不仅看到了工作中不利的一面，也看到了有利的一面。他们在一片鱼鳞、一撮木屑、一角铁皮、一缕炊烟之中，找到了巨大的物资潜力。如果全国各地的从事日用品工业的干部和职工群众都具有这样的志气，精神饱满，干劲十足，一定能够在短期内迅速恢复和大量增产日用工业品，满足日益增长的人民生活的需要。
