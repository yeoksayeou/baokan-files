Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 13th: According to today's "People's Daily" report, news from South Vietnam recently stated that nearly one hundred people held a rally in Saigon on April 20th to protest the crimes of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group in killing South Vietnamese patriots. People held up banners reading "Families of prisoners in Phu Loi concentration camp and other prisons appeal to the National Assembly." These people, who came to Saigon from other places, first gathered at the intersection of Le Loi Avenue and Nguyen Hue Avenue to hold a rally. Residents of nearby streets also joined the rally.

　　When the participants marched to the "National Assembly" meeting hall, the South Vietnamese "National Assembly" was in session. People demanded to meet with the "National Assembly representative" of Thu Dau Mot province, where the Phu Loi concentration camp is located. However, they were blocked by the police, and their resolutions and petitions were confiscated. They were then taken to the police station for imprisonment. Authorities released some people at 3 p.m., while others remained in custody. People launched a struggle to demand the police release those detained. News from South Vietnam also stated that on March 23rd, thousands of working people held a rally on the Saigon-Hoc Mon highway, seven kilometers from Saigon, to protest the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group.

　　Participants in the rally angrily condemned the heinous crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group in poisoning more than 1,000 patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp and carrying out large-scale "sweeps" in many places. They expressed their determination to further strengthen unity, oppose all conspiracies of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group, demand peaceful reunification of the motherland, and avenge the victims of the Phu Loi concentration camp. At the end of the rally, people shouted slogans such as "Down with the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group!" and "U.S. imperialism, get out of South Vietnam!"

    反对美吴集团杀害爱国者
    南越人民举行集会
    新华社河内13日电　据“人民报”今天报道，最近来自南越的消息说，有近一百人曾经在4月20日在西贡举行集会，反对美国和吴庭艳集团杀害南越爱国者的罪行。人们高举着“富利集中营与其他监狱犯人的家属向国会申冤”的标语。这些从外地来到西贡的人们首先汇集在黎利大路和阮惠大路的十字路口，举行集会。附近各街道的居民也参加了这个集会。
    当参加集会的人游行到“国会”会议厅时，南越“国会”正在开会，人们要求同富利集中营所在地的土龙木省“国会代表”见面。但是却遭到警察的阻拦，并且被没收了决议书和请愿书，然后被抓到警察局去监禁，直到下午三时当局才把一部分人释放，另一部分人仍被拘留。人们展开了斗争，要求警察释放这些被拘留的人。来自南越的消息还说，3月23日，曾有成千名劳动人民在离西贡七公里的西贡—旭门公路上举行集会，反对美吴集团的罪行。
    参加集会的人们愤怒谴责美吴集团毒死富利集中营一千多名爱国者和在许多地方大举“扫荡”的万恶罪行。他们表示要进一步加强团结，反对美吴集团的一切阴谋，要求和平统一祖国和为富利集中营的受难者报仇。这次集会的人们最后还高呼“打倒美吴集团！”“美帝国主义滚出南越！”等口号。
