Grasp Summer with One Hand, Autumn with the Other
　　Fujian's Summer Production Upsurge Taking Shape
　　Henan's Million-Strong Army Seizes Moisture to Rush Plant Autumn Fields

　　(Our dispatch from Fuzhou, June 11) Fujian Province is mobilizing the entire Party and all the people to launch a magnificent and large-scale new upsurge in summer agricultural production across the province. On the one hand, it continues to strengthen the late-stage management of early rice, striving for a bumper harvest of summer grain crops. On the other hand, it seizes the opportunity for late-season production, vigorously promoting a large-scale movement for high yields of "thousand-catty rice, ten-thousand-catty sweet potatoes." At the same time, it mobilizes the masses to seize the summer planting season, actively expanding the autumn grain planting area, and striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

　　To organize this production upsurge, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, Prefectural Party Committees, and County Party Committees have recently held enlarged meetings successively to make arrangements. Currently, all parts of the province are vigorously implementing, publicizing, and mobilizing from top to bottom, launching mass movements, and from bottom to top, boosting morale, setting plans, finding measures, and tapping potential. Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Jiang Yizhen, Governor of the Province, and secretaries and members of the Provincial Party Committee, heads of various departments, and responsible cadres of prefectural and county party committees, are all going deep into the countryside and grassroots units to strengthen specific leadership. Various localities have organized large numbers of cadres to go to the countryside and fields, living, eating, and working with the masses.

　　At present, a new upsurge in summer agricultural production is gradually taking shape in all aspects across the province. Party committees leading communes and production teams in the vast mountainous areas of northern, western, and eastern Fujian are having some use 10%-20% of their paddy fields and sweet potato fields to participate in the "thousand-catty rice, ten-thousand-catty sweet potato" high-yield movement. Some are organizing high-yield competitions for "thousand-catty rice, ten-thousand-catty sweet potato" among communes, teams, and plots in areas where conditions permit. In areas with poorer conditions, they are also organizing eight-hundred-catty high-yield competitions. The competition movement mostly starts between teams and gradually develops to communes and counties.

　　While focusing on large-scale, high-yield production, all localities are paying attention to mobilizing the masses to expand planting and intercropping by all possible means to expand the planting area of autumn grains. The communes in Nanping Prefecture are actively planting main grain crops such as rice and increasing the land multiple cropping index, while vigorously expanding and intercropping miscellaneous grain crops in forest land and vacant land. Coastal areas with limited land and large populations, such as Longxi and Jinjiang, are making full use of gaps between economic crops, field ridges, and other spaces to intercrop and expand the planting of miscellaneous grains, launching a mass movement of "planting wherever there is a gap, planting every inch of land," striving for extensive planting and high yields. In order to achieve large-scale, high-yield production and extensive planting and high yields, all localities are regarding the accumulation of large amounts of refined fertilizer, fine fertilizer, and pig manure as one of the key measures to strive for a bumper late-season harvest.

　　(Our dispatch) The massive summer grain harvesting and threshing work is coming to an end, and the summer harvest army in Henan Province is seizing the opportunity to rush plant autumn fields while the soil is still moist. More than 14.45 million people and more than 2.6 million head of livestock have been invested in the summer harvest and summer planting in Henan Province. As of the 6th, the province had harvested more than 55 million mu of summer grain and planted nearly 40 million mu in summer.

　　At the beginning of this year's summer harvest, various parts of Henan Province made preparations for the summer planting work. Yan Jin County's six communes and one hundred and forty brigades prepared more than 24,000 drills for summer planting, and put forward the battle cry of "The whole Party and the whole people are mobilized, seizing the moisture and rushing to plant is not to be delayed, grasping the planting tightly with both hands, and striving for a big increase in autumn production." Before the rain on the 3rd, many places showed signs of drought. Bo’ai County opened the gates of irrigation canals and diverted water from the Qin River to irrigate, implementing harvesting wheat after watering, so that autumn crops could be planted in time after the wheat was harvested. Before the harvest of summer crops, the Kaifeng Prefecture implemented intercropping, spot planting and other methods, and planted 645,000 mu in advance.

　　Various localities had already prepared the summer sowing seeds. They had previously held special meetings to find out the situation, adjust surpluses and deficiencies, and carry out seed selection, drying, and germination tests. In terms of seed adjustment, various localities have given play to the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. The counties in Xuchang Prefecture have widely carried out adjustments between counties. In the rush planting, the land was deeply ploughed as much as possible, deeply cultivated and stubble was eliminated. The area where plowing was done before planting accounted for more than 60% of the area that has already been sown.

　　Before the large-scale development of summer harvest and summer planting, the province launched a large-scale fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production movement, accumulating more than 480 billion jin of fertilizer, including more than 200 billion jin of manure, of which nearly 200 billion jin have been delivered to the fields. After the summer harvest and summer planting were launched in a big way, various localities organized specialized labor and animal power to make concentrated efforts to deliver manure. Some counties in Xinxiang Prefecture also implemented the "carrying one hundred jin of fertilizer per day" movement by each laborer using the opportunity to go to the fields. (Attached picture)

    一手抓夏　一手抓秋
    福建夏季生产高潮正在形成
    河南百万大军趁墒抢种秋田
    本报福州11日电　福建省正在动员全党、全民的力量，在全省掀起一个声势壮阔、规模浩大的夏季农业生产新高潮，一面继续加强早稻后期管理，力争夏季粮食作物丰产丰收；一面抓紧晚季生产，大搞千斤稻、万斤薯的大面积丰产运动，同时，发动群众紧紧抓住夏种时机，积极扩大秋粮种植面积，力争秋季农业生产大丰收。
    为了组织这一生产高潮，福建省委、地委和县委，最近先后召开了扩大会议，作了部署。目前，全省各地正在从上而下地大贯彻、大宣传、大发动、大搞群众运动和从下而上地鼓干劲，订计划，找措施，挖潜力。省委第一书记叶飞、省长江一真和省委书记、委员、各部门负责人以及地、县委负责干部等，都分头深入农村和基层，加强具体领导；各地组织了大批干部下乡、下田，与群众同吃同住同劳动。
    现在，全省夏季农业生产新高潮正从各个方面逐步形成。福建北部、西部和东部广大山区的党委领导各公社生产队，有的以10％—20％的水稻田和甘薯田参加千斤稻、万斤薯丰产运动；有的在有条件的地区组织“千斤稻、万斤薯”社、队、片的丰产竞赛；在条件较差的地区也组织八百斤丰产竞赛。竞赛运动大都是先在队与队之间展开，再逐步发展到社与社、县与县。
    各地在大抓大面积高额丰产同时，都注意发动群众千方百计地进行扩种、套种，扩大秋粮种植面积。南平专区各公社在积极种好稻谷等主要粮食作物和增加土地复种指数同时，大搞林地、空地扩种套种杂粮作物。龙溪、晋江等地少人多的沿海地区，都充分利用各种经济作物行间、田埂等空隙，进行套种、扩种杂粮，开展群众性的“见缝就插、寸土必种”，力争广种多收运动。为了实现大面积高额丰产和广种多收，各地都把大积精肥、细肥和圈猪肥，作为力争晚季丰收的关键性措施之一。
    本报讯　声势浩大的夏粮抢收抢打工作即将结束，河南省夏收大军正抓紧时机，转向趁墒抢种秋田。河南省投入夏收夏种达一千四百五十多万人，牲畜二百六十多万头。到6日止，全省已收割夏粮五千五百万亩以上，夏种面积已接近四千万亩。
    今年夏收一开始，河南各地对夏种工作就作好了准备。延津县六个公社一百四十个大队准备妥夏种的耧二万四千多个，提出：“全党全民总动员，趁墒抢种不容缓，双手大抓播种关，力争秋季大增产”的战斗口号。3日下雨前，好多地方呈旱象，博爱县就开放灌渠闸门，引沁河水灌溉，实行先浇后割小麦，以便收割了小麦及时播种秋季作物。开封专区在夏收作物收割前，实行套种、点种等办法，提前播种六十四万五千亩。
    各地对夏播种籽早就做了准备。都事先召开了专门会议，摸清情况，进行余缺调剂，做到了选种、翻晒、发芽试验等工作。在种籽调剂方面，各地发挥了互助协作精神。许昌专区各县之间广泛开展了县与县之间的调剂。在抢种中，尽量进行了深翻土地，深耕灭茬，先犁后种的面积，占已经播种面积的60％以上。
    在夏收夏种大规模开展以前，全省掀起了一次规模宏大的积肥和造肥运动，积肥四千八百多亿斤，其中粪肥二千多亿斤，已经送到田边近二千亿斤。夏收夏种大举展开后，各地多组织专业劳、畜力突击送粪。新乡专区有的县还实行每个劳动力利用往田里的机会，开展“日捎百斤肥”运动。（附图片）
