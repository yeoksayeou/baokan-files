Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 4th: The Cuban government officially announced the land reform law today and began its formal implementation.

The land reform law stipulates the distribution of 252,000 caballerías of land, benefiting more than two million Cuban farmers. Due to the implementation of this land reform law, 4,423 existing large estates and land worth 100 million pesos will be affected.

Currently, American monopoly organizations and large estate owners have launched a large-scale movement against the land reform law. A public debate on land reform was held on television on the 2nd. During the debate, representatives of the landowners openly demanded amendments to the land reform law, demanding that large estate owners be allowed to "participate in the land reform committee," and opposed the quota stipulated in the land reform law regarding livestock owners only being allowed to own one hundred caballerías of land. The representatives of the large estate owners also tried to prevent the land reform law from being implemented within three years. However, these demands of the landowners were refuted by Núñez Jiménez, director of the Land Reform Committee. He cited facts to show that land reform is an inevitable trend and expressed his determination to implement land reform.

Some American newspapers and large estate owners, attempting to undermine Cuba's land reform, have recently intentionally distorted Prime Minister Castro's remarks. Castro said in his talk that land reform would only be implemented on land used for sugarcane cultivation after the next sugarcane harvest. However, Castro's remarks were deliberately distorted, giving the impression that Cuba's land reform would be put on hold. The actual situation is that the law stipulates the steps for implementing land reform, first distributing state-owned land, distributing land confiscated from corrupt officials, and privately leased land, and then finally land owned by sugar companies exceeding the legal limits.

As soon as the land reform law took effect, people across the country expressed their support for the government's measures. The Cuban people are mobilizing to oppose the destructive activities of American monopoly organizations and Cuban large estate owners.

    古巴政府颁布土改法令
    二百多万农户将得到好处
    新华社哈瓦那4日电古巴官方今天公布了土地改革法，并且开始正式实施。
    土地改革法规定分配二十五万二千卡瓦耶里亚土地，受益的古巴农民有二百多万。由于这项土地改革法的实行，四千四百二十三个现存的大庄园和价值一亿比索的土地将受影响。
    目前，美国垄断组织和大庄园主发动了规模庞大的反对土地改革法的运动。2日在电视中曾就土地改革进行了一公开辩论。在辩论中，地主的代表们公开要求修改土地改革法，要求允许大庄园主“参加土地改革委员会”，并且反对土地改革法中规定的关于畜牧业主只能拥有一百卡瓦耶里亚土地的限额。大庄园主的代表们还力图使土地改革法在三年之内不执行。但是，地主们的这些要求遭到土地改革委员会主任努涅斯·希门尼斯的驳斥。他列举事实说明土地改革是一个不可避免的趋势，并表示决心要贯彻土地改革。
    企图破坏古巴土地改革的一些美国报刊和大庄园主最近还有意歪曲卡斯特罗总理的谈话。卡斯特罗在谈话中曾说，只有在下一次甘蔗收成后才在种植甘蔗的土地上实行土地改革。但是，卡斯特罗的谈话被故意地歪曲，使人产生一种印象似乎古巴的土地改革要搁置起来。实际情况是，法律规定了实行土地改革的步骤，首先是分配国有土地、分配被没收的贪污者的土地和租佃出去的私人土地，然后才轮到占有的土地超过法律规定的糖业企业的土地。
    土地改革法一生效，全国人民都表示支持政府的措施。古巴人民正在动员起来反对美国垄断组织和古巴大庄园主的破坏活动。
