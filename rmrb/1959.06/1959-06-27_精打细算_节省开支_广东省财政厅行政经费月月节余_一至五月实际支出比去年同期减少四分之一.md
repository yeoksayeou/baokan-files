    Guangzhou, June 26th (report from this newspaper) - The Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance has consistently adhered to the spirit of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings and has carefully calculated its administrative expenses. From 1956 to May of this year, there has been a surplus in administrative expenses every year and every month. The actual administrative expenses from January to May this year decreased by 25.6% compared to the same period last year.
    Starting in 1957, the department comprehensively formulated a management method for saving administrative expenses, and designated relevant staff to be responsible for inspection and supervision. The director of the department also frequently participated in the inspection. If overspending was discovered, the reasons were immediately analyzed and measures were taken to correct it.
    This department held eight provincial-level meetings of various sizes this year, and the actual expenses were much lower than the original budget. Their methods are: no serving cigarettes or fruit, no gift-giving, and no banquets, etc.
    Because the leadership emphasizes the importance of diligence and thrift at all times, the cadres pay attention to saving administrative expenses bit by bit. Cadres process and reuse many waste materials themselves. For example, some outdated tax invoices, reports, account books, etc., were originally prepared to be sent to paper mills as raw materials. After processing by the staff, these waste papers were printed into official documents, new reports, envelopes, etc. From January to May of this year, they saved nearly one hundred reams of paper. Refurbishing old envelopes and grinding down nibs of pens that have been hooked has become a habit of the staff in various departments of this department.
    The concept of saving administrative expenses bit by bit is relatively strong among the cadres of the Department of Finance. They not only do not spend a single penny of the state casually, but also do not let go of even the scraps of paper from sweeping the floor. Now, the scraps of paper swept up from the floor in this department every day are screened by cleaners with bamboo sieves to remove dust and then collected and sold to paper mills as raw materials. According to estimates, more than 20,000 jin have been sold since the rectification campaign last year.
    In order to enable the cadres to better cultivate the work style of diligence and thrift, the department recently revised the administrative expense management methods and added new savings measures in light of the new situation.

    精打细算　节省开支
    广东省财政厅行政经费月月节余
    一至五月实际支出比去年同期减少四分之一
    本报广州26日电　广东省财政厅几年来一贯本着勤俭办一切事业的精神，对本厅行政经费的开支精打细算。从1956年到今年5月为止，行政经费年年有节余，月月有节余，今年1月至5月实际支出的行政经费又比去年同期减少25.6％。
    从1957年开始，这个厅就全面制定了一个节约行政经费开支的管理办法，并且指定有关工作人员负责检查督促，厅长也经常参加检查。发现有超支现象，立即分析原因，采取措施予以纠正。
    这个厅今年召开过八次全省性的大小会议，实际支出费用比原计划数节省很多。他们的办法是：不招待香烟、水果，不送礼，不会餐等。
    由于领导上时时刻刻强调勤俭节约的重要，干部们都注意一点一滴地节约行政经费，干部们把很多废物经过自己加工处理又利用起来。比如一些过了时的税票、报表、账本等，本来准备送到纸厂作原料的，经过工作人员的加工，这些废纸便被印刷成公文纸、新的报表、信封等使用。今年1月至5月，他们共节省纸张近一百令。把旧信封翻新，钢笔嘴钓了就磨，已成了这个厅各处室工作人员的习惯了。
    一点一滴节约行政经费开支，这种观念在财政厅的干部中是比较强烈的。他们不仅不随便花国家一个钱，而且连扫地的碎纸也不肯放过。现在，这个厅每天扫地扫起来的碎纸，都是由清洁员用竹筛筛去尘土，集中起来卖给造纸厂作原料。据估算，从去年整风到现在已经卖出了二万多斤。
    为了使干部们更好地培养克勤克俭的作风，这个厅最近又修订了行政经费管理办法，并针对新的情况增加了新的节约措施。
