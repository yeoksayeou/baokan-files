Talking to High School Graduates About University Aspirations
Du Ping

In another month, approximately 300,000 graduating high school students nationwide will be finishing their secondary education and embarking on a new phase of their lives. This is a significant event both for our country and for each high school graduate. Currently, every graduate is contemplating their future path. The primary questions they are considering are: whether to pursue higher education, and how to choose their university aspirations, etc.

Should one pursue higher education? From the perspective of both national needs and individual aspirations, the answer is affirmative. Therefore, in past years, as graduation approaches, many students begin to prepare themselves diligently: reviewing their lessons, and inquiring about the various departments and programs of universities and relevant application matters.

Since last year, our socialist construction has achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward, and the backwardness of industry and agriculture is being rapidly transformed. This situation requires our country to quickly and substantially cultivate advanced construction talent with socialist consciousness. Universities are the main places for cultivating national construction talent who have socialist consciousness, a relatively high level of scientific and cultural knowledge, and mastery of a specific professional field. High school graduates are the primary source of university admissions. With the great development of the entire construction endeavor, the scale of educational development is also growing, and therefore, the task of university admissions this year is also very large; this requires a sufficient source of qualified candidates. Therefore, this year's high school graduates should actively prepare themselves and enthusiastically apply to universities to meet the nation's need for cultivating construction talent.

Regarding the choice of university aspirations, some students still hold views such as: since one must obey the state's allocation anyway, there is no need to choose personal aspirations; or they are unwilling to openly discuss their personal ideals and aspirations, fearing being labeled as individualistic. Naturally, every high school graduate should resolutely obey the state's allocation, but they should also carefully choose their personal university aspirations and combine the two well.

Building socialism and communism on the land of our motherland is the common ideal and goal of struggle for the entire nation and its youth, and everyone is contributing their strength to achieving this goal. However, the talent needed for socialist construction is diverse, and individual talents, interests, physical conditions, etc., also vary. Thus, the question of each individual's aspiration to realize this common ideal arises. High school graduates, under the premise of obeying the needs of the state, should determine their aspirations based on their specific conditions, giving their studies and life a concrete goal, so that they can better exert their enthusiasm for learning and their spirit of diligent research, and learn their lessons even better; this will be conducive to better "making the best use of talent" when participating in the construction of the motherland in the future. We know that the more fully individual talents and interests, which do not hinder collective interests, are developed, the more benefits they bring to the collective. Such legitimate aspirations and interests will not only not be criticized, but will also receive the necessary encouragement and consideration they deserve. In the past, university admissions have always considered the aspirations of applicants as much as possible under the premise of national needs. Personal ideals and aspirations cannot be equated with individualism. Whether or not one is an individualist depends not on whether one has personal ideals and aspirations, but on whether one proceeds from the thought of serving the people.

In the application process, if a situation arises where personal aspirations do not align with national needs, there is no doubt that one should consciously and happily obey the needs of the state and re-select one's aspirations. A person's interests and hobbies are not fixed, but can be cultivated. Under possible conditions, personal interests and hobbies can be taken care of; but this is not absolute, and should be realized under the principle of obeying the interests of the state. In our revolutionary ranks, many comrades, in the past, left their original occupations to participate in armed struggle for the needs of the revolution, and trained themselves into outstanding commanders and fighters. Today, likewise for the needs of the revolution, they have turned to engage in various jobs they are unfamiliar with, such as industry, finance and economics, culture and education, and foreign affairs. Because they constantly study diligently at work, they gradually become proficient in their business, and their interest is cultivated in this process. These veteran comrades are models for young students and should be taken as examples when choosing their university aspirations.

We hope that graduating high school students, based on the needs of the motherland and their own aspirations, will carefully choose the subjects to apply for, carefully review their lessons, and prepare to achieve excellent results in the examination, so that various universities can admit qualified new students.

    和高中毕业生谈谈升学志愿
    杜平
    再过一个月，全国有大约三十万应届高中毕业生就要结束中学的学业，开始一个新的生活阶段了。这对于我们的国家，对于每一个高中毕业生来说，都是一件大事。现在，每一个毕业生都在考虑着自己未来的生活道路。他们所考虑的主要问题是：要不要升学，如何选择自己的升学志愿等。
    要不要升学？从国家的需要和个人的愿望说，都是可以肯定的。因此，历年来，每当临近毕业的时候，许多同学就开始紧张地准备起来：复习功课，到处探问高等学校各种系科的情况和有关报考的事情。
    去年以来，我国社会主义建设事业取得了空前的大跃进，工业、农业的落后面貌，正在迅速改变。这种形势要求我们国家必须迅速地大量地培养有社会主义觉悟的高级建设人才。高等学校是培养具有社会主义觉悟、有较高的科学文化水平、掌握某一门专业知识的国家建设人才的主要场所，而高中毕业生又是高等学校招生的主要来源。随着整个建设事业的大发展，学校教育的发展规模也愈来愈大，因此，今年高等学校招生的任务也很大；这就要有足够的合乎质量要求的考生来源。所以，今年高中毕业生，应该积极准备条件，踊跃报考高等学校，以满足国家培养建设人才的需要。
    选择升学志愿，这在部分同学中至今还有一些这样的看法，认为反正要服从祖国分配，就不必选择什么个人志愿了；或者不愿公开谈个人理想志愿，怕被别人说成个人主义。对每个高中毕业生来说，自然应该坚决服从祖国分配，但也要认真选择个人升学志愿，并把两者很好地结合起来。
    在祖国的土地上建设社会主义和共产主义，这是全国人民和青年的共同理想和奋斗目标，大家都在为实现这个目标而贡献自己的力量。但是，社会主义建设所需要的人才是多种多样的，而各个人的特长、爱好、身体条件等也存在着差别。因此就产生了每个人实现这个共同理想的个人志愿问题。高中毕业生在服从国家需要的前提下，根据个人的具体条件，确定志愿，使学习和生活有了具体的目标，这样就可以更好地发挥学习上的积极性和钻研精神，把功课学得更好；这就有利于在将来参加祖国建设时，能够更好地“人尽其才”。我们知道，不妨碍集体利益的个人的特长和爱好越是得到充分的发挥，就越能给集体带来好处。这样一种正当的志愿、爱好，不仅不会受到批判，而且会得到应有的必要的鼓励和照顾。历年来高等学校的招生工作，也都是在国家需要的前提下尽可能地照顾了报考同学的志愿的。个人的理想、志愿是不能够和个人主义等同起来的。是不是个人主义，问题不在于是否有个人的理想志愿，而在于是否从为人民服务的思想出发。
    在报考过程中，如果发生了个人志愿同国家需要不相符合的情况，毫无疑问，应当自觉地愉快地服从国家的需要，重新选填志愿。一个人的兴趣爱好并不是固定不变的，而是可以培养起来的。在可能条件下，个人的兴趣爱好，是可以得到照顾的；但也不是绝对的，应当是在服从国家利益的原则下实现的。在我们的革命队伍中，有许多同志，过去为了革命的需要，曾经脱离了原来的职业，参加武装斗争，把自己锻炼成杰出的指挥员和战斗员。今天，同样地为了革命的需要，他们又转而从事各种他们所不熟悉的工作，如工业、财经、文教、外交等工作。由于他们在工作中不断地刻苦钻研，逐渐精通了业务，从外行变成了内行，而兴趣也就在这个过程中培养起来了。这些老同志是青年学生的典范，应当作为自己选择升学志愿的榜样。
    我们希望应届高中毕业生，根据祖国的需要，各自的志愿，认真选择投考的学科，认真温习功课，准备在考试中获得优良的成绩，让各类高等学校能够录取符合要求的新生吧。
