    The principle of socialist scientific research is to integrate theory with practice. It shouldn't be a problem for technical sciences to realize this principle. Practice has repeatedly proven this. However, practice will also prove that such advocacy is only a general principle, and each discipline must, according to its own characteristics and current situation, gradually determine its direction more completely and meticulously, striving to obtain better work results. The research work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the fields of machinery, power, and electrical engineering is proving such a conclusion.

    During the Great Leap Forward last year, the research work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the fields of machinery, power, and electrical engineering revolved around production and construction. As a result, they made achievements and gained experience. Now, after discussion, they have affirmed last year's achievements and clarified that in the future, the focus should be on studying major problems in local production and construction, combined with the development of new technologies and basic scientific research. This is necessary and timely.

    在实践中明确方向
    社会主义科学研究的原则是理论联系实际。技术科学要实现这一原则是不会成为问题的。实践已经一再作出了证明。但是，实践也会证明，这样提倡只是一个总的原则，各学科还必须根据各自的特点和现状，逐渐把方向确定得更完整、更细致，力求获得更好的工作成果。中国科学院机械、动力、电工方面的研究工作正证明了这样的论断。
    去年大跃进中，中国科学院机械、动力、电工方面的研究工作，是围绕了生产建设进行的。因此，他们就作出了成绩，获得了经验。现在，他们经过讨论，肯定了去年的成就，明确了今后要以研究当地生产建设中的重大问题为主，结合开展新技术和基础科学的研究。这是必要而适时的。
