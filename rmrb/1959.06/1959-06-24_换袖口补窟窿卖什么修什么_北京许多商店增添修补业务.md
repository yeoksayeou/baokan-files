    Replacing Cuffs and Mending Holes: Sell What You Repair, Repair What You Sell
    Many Beijing Stores Add Repair Services

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Recently, many stores in Beijing have put up new signs: "We undertake repairs of daily necessities."

    A special clothing repair counter has been set up at the entrance of the Da Shi Lan (大栅栏) Clothing Store outside Qianmen. The staff here specialize in repairing various types of clothing for customers. According to the customer's requirements, they shorten clothes that are too long to fit properly, and turn worn-out collars into complete ones. They also replace cuffs and mend holes in clothes. One noon, a customer brought a white poplin shirt with a torn collar to be turned over. After waiting for half an hour, the collar was turned over and repaired for only 20 cents. The Wangfujing Children's Store has added a toy repair service, and now many customers come here every day to request repairs of various toys.

    The Dongsi People's Market has added a sock mending service, which is particularly popular. In addition to setting up special counters for repairing goods, many store salespeople also serve as repairers, repairing what they sell. Of the 600 employees at the Dongsi People's Market, more than 40 can now repair goods, and the number of repair service items in the entire market has increased from more than 40 in the past to more than 60.

    The stores' addition of repair services has been warmly welcomed by the citizens. However, this is still in its initial stage, and it will take some time to meet the needs of the vast number of customers. The relevant departments in Beijing are now continuing to plan this matter.

    换袖口补窟窿卖什么修什么
    北京许多商店增添修补业务
    据新华社讯　北京许多商店的门前，最近挂出了新牌子——承修人民生活用品。
    前门外大栅栏服装商店的门口设了一个专修服装的柜台。这里的业务员，专门为顾客修理各种服装。他们按照顾客的要求，把过长的衣服改短适体，把磨破了的领子翻改成完整的；他还给衣服换袖口、缝补窟窿。一天中午，一位顾客拿着一件领子破了的白府绸衬衣到这里来翻改，等了半个多小时，领子就翻改好了，只花了两毛钱的修补费。王府井儿童商店里新增了修理玩具的业务，现在每天都有许多顾客到这里来请求修理各种玩具。
    东四人民市场增加了修补袜子的业务，生意特别好。除了设立承修商品的专柜以外，不少商店的售货员兼作修理，卖什么就修理什么。东四人民市场的六百名业务员，现在已有四十多人会修理商品，全场的修理业务项目由过去的四十多种增加到六十多种。
    商店兼修理业务，受到了市民们的热烈欢迎。但现在还是初创时期，要满足广大顾客的需要，还需要一个过程。北京市的有关部门，现在正在继续筹划这件事。
