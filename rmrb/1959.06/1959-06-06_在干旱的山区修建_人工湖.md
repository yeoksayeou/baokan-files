　　Building "Artificial Lakes" in Arid Mountainous Areas
　　The car travels south not far from Tongxin County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Looking out from the car window, the Qingshui River is bisected by a long dragon-like dam, and the river water is like a mirror embedded in the riverbed, rippling with blue waves. The passengers in the car excitedly shouted, "Zhangjiawan Reservoir! Zhangjiawan Reservoir!"
　　The "Artificial Lake" Initially Shows its Grand Design
　　This reservoir is not yet completed, but it has already begun to show its grand design. The dam has already been built as high as a two-story building, and has already stored seven or eight million cubic meters of water. When the dam is completed, it will be two *li* long, and can store 100 million cubic meters of water, irrigating more than 220,000 *mu* of land. If you want to walk around the reservoir for a week, you have to walk dozens of *li*. At that time, in this famous arid mountainous area, there will be a large-scale "artificial lake."
　　Building such a large reservoir project in an arid mountainous area is as arduous as transforming the Gobi Desert. Thousands of Hui and Han farmers from Tongxin County, after hard work last winter and this spring, have already seen the main dam of the reservoir rise rumblingly, horizontally locking the riverbed. Now people are competing with the flood, rushing to overcome the flood gate, and striving for the victory of the decisive stage of the reservoir construction. Obviously, people regard the construction of such a large reservoir project as a symbol of fundamentally changing the natural appearance of the mountainous area and building a beautiful and happy life in the mountainous area. They are not afraid of any difficulties and are determined to basically complete the reservoir within a year, so that the Qingshui River will forever benefit the people, and the county, which has been arid for generations, will fundamentally change its appearance.
　　The reporter interviewed many reservoir builders, all of whom were full of energy and confidence in building the reservoir. When talking about building such a large reservoir, people were all smiles, and they kept talking about its benefits: after the reservoir is completed, it can turn thousands of years of dry land into paddy fields, and grain production will increase several times; it can be combined with soil and water conservation to control floods and develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, etc.; it can provide clear water sources for many arid villages, so they will no longer worry about not having water to drink; it can generate electricity, making the nearby rural areas electrified; it can change the climate, turning this arid mountainous area that looks like it has been burned into a beautiful mountainous area...
　　Must Build the Reservoir Well
　　What an inspiring construction project this is! Yang Baocang, an 81-year-old Hui man who has suffered from drought, came to the reservoir construction site from 80 *li* away and repeatedly told his son Yang Zhanbao: "We must work hard to build the reservoir well. This is what our ancestors have been looking forward to!"
　　Old Man Yang's words expressed the wishes of the Hui and Han people. For many years, water has been so precious to the people of Tongxin County! In winter, people sweep snow into cellars, and in summer, they accumulate rainwater to solve the problem of drinking water for people and livestock. Once there is no rain for dozens of days, a bucket of water will sell for more than one *kuai*, and people watch helplessly as crops wither in the fields. Droughts occur year after year, and sometimes there is no harvest at all. At that time, people abandon their children and sell their daughters to "flee the famine." Before liberation, Tongxin County was in a tragic situation due to years of famine, with nine out of ten houses empty and wasteland in patches. The original county had 60,000 to 70,000 people, but by the time of liberation, there were only more than 20,000 people left.
　　The Qingshui River flows through the east of Tongxin County. The Hui and Han people of Tongxin County have long called the Qingshui River the "Bitter Water River." This is because, on the one hand, the water of the Qingshui River is highly alkaline and cannot be used for irrigation or drinking; on the other hand, people use the water of the Qingshui River to compare the bitterness of their lives, as if there is no end. But everyone still has a little fantasy, hoping that one day the water of the "Bitter Water River" can become sweet water for them to drink and irrigate. However, year after year passed, the water of the Qingshui River was still bitter, and droughts continued. The farmers had to hang their heads and look at the water of the Qingshui River, and some simply fled to other places. The Wangjiatuan Village, where the Hui people lived, originally had more than 100 households, but by the time of liberation, only seven households were left. After liberation, the Party led the prevention of drought and the construction of water conservancy projects, and people turned their hopes to the Qingshui River again, carrying ice blocks from the river to the fields piece by piece in winter to prevent and fight drought. However, irrigating with ice blocks is still very alkaline and cannot solve the big problem.
　　Last year, before the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Party proposed to comprehensively manage the Qingshui River, build reservoirs in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the river, block and store floodwater, and change the Bitter Water River. People's wishes began to be realized, and the name "Bitter Water River" was officially changed to "Qingshui River."
　　They are the "Special Model Company"
　　The Zhangjiawan Reservoir is the largest reservoir built on this "Qingshui River." When the county party committee announced the start of the reservoir construction, the Hui and Han people of the county rushed to the construction site like a tide. Many old people were so excited that they could not sleep when they heard about the construction of such a reservoir, and the young people were even more motivated and made vows at the reservoir: "We will not go home until the reservoir project is completed." At the construction site, I met Ma Baoying, a Hui woman. She is an ordinary rural woman in her thirties, the company commander of the sixth regiment on the construction site, and her face is tanned by the sun. Although she is small in stature, she is so energetic. When I saw her, she was leading hundreds of women to attack the earth dam. She came to the reservoir construction site in October last year and has not returned home since. In the cold winter months of last year, the main dam project of the reservoir had just started. In order to prevent the slightest flow of floodwater and ensure the smooth construction of the main dam project, the construction site decided to build a temporary earth dam 200 meters upstream of the main dam to block the river water. At that time, due to the rising water level, the dam was washed away several times. At this time, the more than 500 Hui and Han women led by Ma Baoying automatically took on the task of closing the temporary earth dam. At night, she and other female migrant workers stayed on the construction site, and during the day she led women to block the river water. At that time, the cold wind was biting, and the ground was frozen three feet deep, as hard as iron. They proposed: "We will not withdraw until the ground is frozen three feet deep, and we are not afraid of the cold when it snows three feet deep," "The cold weather does not freeze our determination, and the wind does not blow down our enthusiasm," and transported pieces of frozen soil to the breach. At the most critical moment of closure, she did not sleep for three days and three nights, and personally took the lead in jumping into the water to block the water. In this way, the river water was finally blocked, ensuring the smooth construction of the main dam, and creating a new record of 3.2 cubic meters of work efficiency per person per day. Originally, the construction site headquarters planned to control the river water for 15 days, but due to their heroic struggle, they controlled it for two months. Later, the construction site headquarters specially awarded the title of "Special Model Company" to commend their achievements.
　　Learning Technology to Improve Work Efficiency
　　There are many young tractor drivers on the construction site. Judging from their attire, they are mostly rural youths, the youngest being only seventeen years old. Everyone skillfully operates the tractor on the construction site. Among them, there is a Hui young woman named Su Kelian, who is eighteen years old. She came to the construction site as soon as the reservoir project started last year. At that time, she participated in the Communist Youth League congress in the county. She was so excited that she could not sleep when she heard the news that the Zhangjiawan Reservoir project had started. She did not go home and directly signed up to come to the reservoir construction site. After arriving at the construction site, she began to carry soil with a back bucket and tamp the foundation, which was very inefficient. Later, tractors came to the construction site. She thought: "It would be great to be a tractor driver! After the reservoir project is completed, I can go back to the commune to cultivate the land with a tractor." Therefore, she repeatedly requested to learn how to drive a tractor. With the approval of the construction site headquarters, she moved her luggage to the tractor station to learn how to drive a tractor. At the beginning, she could not even remember the names of many parts of the tractor, so she learned technology while learning culture, and asked others for advice if she did not understand. In the winter weather, she got up before dawn to light a fire to heat the machine. After more than ten days of study, she quickly mastered the driving skills. When people asked her why she was so active, she flicked her head and said, "For the construction of the reservoir, for the construction of socialism!"
　　From this tense and enthusiastic labor scene, it is not difficult to see that everyone who comes to the reservoir construction site wants to do their best, give full play to their wisdom, work hard and skillfully, and contribute their strength to this magnificent project. The young ironworker Liu Jianhua is like this. When the reservoir construction entered the tense stage of fighting the flood, the construction site needed a lot of iron rings for the newly arrived rubber-tired carts. Without them, the carts could not move, which affected the progress of the construction. Originally, it took a lot of time to make iron rings by burning them with fire, and not many could be made in a day. Liu Jianhua became more and more anxious. If he did not improve work efficiency, he would not be able to meet the needs of reservoir construction. What should he do? He and the young worker Wan Mao boldly conceived and experimented during rest time, sometimes they did not sleep at night. After many experiments, they finally increased the efficiency of making iron rings by 66 times compared to the original. He also painstakingly researched and trial-produced tiger-head pliers, bead bowls, and other things that could not be bought locally for the construction site, which greatly solved the difficulties in construction.
　　I interviewed many people like Ma Baoying, Su Kelian, and Liu Jianhua on the construction site. They are all ordinary farmers, ordinary young people, and ordinary women, but they are all inspired by a beautiful ideal, that is, to build the arid mountainous area into a beautiful and happy mountainous area.

### 在干旱的山区修建“人工湖”

    在干旱的山区修建“人工湖”
    汽车驶过宁夏回族自治区同心县城向南不远，从车窗向外眺望，清水河被一条长龙似的大坝拦腰斩断，河水像一面镜子镶在河床上，碧波荡漾。同车的旅客兴奋地喊起来：“张家弯水库！张家弯水库！”
    “人工湖”初展鸿图
    这座水库还没有建成，但已初展鸿图，拦河大坝已经筑得有两层楼房那么高，已经蓄水七、八百万方。大坝完工后有两华里路那么长，可以蓄水一亿公方，灌地二十二万多亩。如果要绕水库走上一周，得走几十里路。那时，在这个著名的干旱山区，就会出现一个规模很大的“人工湖”。
    在干旱山区修建这样大的水库工程，正像改造戈壁沙漠一样艰巨。来自同心县成千上万的回汉族农民，经过去冬今春的苦战，水库的主坝已经隆隆突起，横锁住河床。现在人们又在和洪水竞赛，抢渡洪水关，争取建设水库决定性阶段的胜利。很显然，人们都把建设这样大的水库工程看成是根本改变山区自然面貌，建设山区美丽幸福生活的标志。他们不畏任何困难，决心要在一年内把水库基本建成，使清水河永远为人民造福，使这个世世代代干旱的县，从根本上改变它的面貌。
    记者访问了许多水库建设者，他们人人神情振奋，精力充沛，对建设水库充满着信心。一谈起建设这样大的水库，人们都眉开眼笑，对它的好处说个不停：水库建成以后，可以使千百年旱地变水田，粮食要增产几倍；可以结合水土保持，控制洪水，发展林业、牧业、副业等；可以使许多干旱的村庄，都有清清的水源，而不再愁没有水吃；可以发电，使附近农村电气化；可以改变气候，使这个干旱得像火烧了的山区变成美丽的山区……。
    一定要修好水库
    这是多么鼓舞人心的建设啊！一位饱经干旱苦楚的八十一岁的回族老大爷杨保仓，从八十里路以外来到水库工地，再三地嘱咐他的儿子杨占保说：“一定要努力把水库修好，这是我们祖祖辈辈盼望的啊！”
    杨老大爷的话，说出了回汉族人民的心意。多少年来，水对同心县人民是多么宝贵！冬天人们把雪扫进窖里，夏天又把雨水蓄积起来，用以解决人畜饮水。一旦遇到几十天不下雨，一桶水就卖上一块多钱，人们眼巴巴地看着庄稼枯死在地里。旱灾一年连一年，有时颗粒不收，那时人们就弃儿卖女去“逃荒”。解放前同心县由于连年灾荒，形成十室九空，荒地连片的凄惨景象，原来全县有六、七万人，到解放时只剩下二万多人了。
    清水河流经同心县城东，同心县的回汉族人民长久以来，把清水河叫“苦水河”。这是因为一方面清水河的水碱性大，不能灌地，不能饮用；另一方面，人们又以清水河的流水比喻他们生活的苦楚，好像没个尽头。但是大家仍然还有一点幻想，希望有一天“苦水河”的水能变成甜水，供他们饮用、浇地。然而希望年复一年的过去了，清水河的水仍然是苦水，旱灾仍然不断，农民们只得看着清水河的水垂下头去，有的干脆逃往异乡。回族人民聚居的王家团庄原来有一百多户人家，到解放时只剩下七户。解放以后，党领导防旱抗旱，兴修水利，人们又把希望转到清水河上，冬天把河里的冰块一块一块搬到地里，防旱抗旱。但是用冰块浇地，碱性仍然很大，而且不能解决大问题。
    去年宁夏回族自治区成立前，党提出综合治理清水河，在河的上、中、下游兴修水库，把洪水拦蓄起来，改变苦水河。人们的愿望开始实现了，“苦水河”的名字，也被正式改为“清水河”了。
    她们是“特等模范连”
    张家弯水库就是在这个“清水河”上兴修的一个最大的蓄水库。当县委宣布水库建设开工的时候，全县回汉族人民像潮水一样奔向工地。多少个老年人听到兴修这样的水库，兴奋得睡不着觉，青年人更是干劲冲天，在水库上立下了誓言：“不完成水库工程不回家”。在工地上，我遇见了回族妇女马保英。她是一个三十多岁的普通农村妇女，是工地六团的一个连长，面部被太阳晒得黝黑。她身材虽然瘦小，但干劲却是那么大。我见她的时候，她正在带领几百个妇女抢攻土坝。她从去年10月来到水库工地，一直没有回家。去年十冬腊月，水库的主坝工程刚刚开工，为了不让洪水点滴空流和使主坝工程顺利施工，工地上决定在距主坝二百多公尺远的主坝上游，修一个临时土坝，拦蓄河水，当时由于水位上涨，几次将坝冲开。这时马保英率领的五百多回汉族妇女就自动担任合龙临时土坝的任务。晚上，她和其他女民工坚守在工地，白天带领妇女拦堵河水。当时寒风刺骨，地冻三尺，坚如铁石。她们提出：“地冻三尺不收兵，雪下三尺不怕冷”、“天冻不掉决心，风吹不倒干劲”，把一块块冻土运到龙口。在合龙最紧张的时刻，她三天三夜没有入睡，亲自带头跳下水去堵水。就这样，终于堵住了河水，保证了主坝顺利施工，并且创造了每人每日工效三点二方的新纪录。原先工地指挥部计划控制河水十五天，但由于她们英勇奋战，控制了两个月。后来工地指挥部为表扬她们的战功，特地奖给“特等模范连”的称号。
    学习技术提高工效
    在工地上有很多年轻的拖拉机手，从她们的装束看来，大都是农村青年，最小的只有十七岁，个个熟练地操纵拖拉机在工地上奔驰。其中有个名叫苏克莲的十八岁的回族青年妇女，从去年水库工程一开工就来到了工地。当时，她在县上参加团代会，听到张家弯水库工程开工的消息，兴奋得睡不着，没有回家就径直报名来到水库工地。到工地以后，开始用背斗背土，用夯打基，效率很低。后来工地上来了拖拉机。她想：“当一个拖拉机手多好啊！干完水库工程，再回到公社用拖拉机耕地。”因此，她就再三要求学开拖拉机。经过工地指挥部批准，她就搬着行李跑到拖拉机站，学习开拖拉机。开始连拖拉机的许多名称也记不住，就一面学技术，一面学文化，不懂就请教别人。冬天天气，天不明就爬起来点火烤机器，她经过十多天学习，就很快掌握了驾驶技术。人们问她为什么这样积极，她头一甩说：“为了建设水库，为了建设社会主义呗！”
    从这里紧张热烈的劳动景象不难看出，来到水库工地的每一个人，都想尽最大努力，发挥自己的智慧，苦干、巧干，为这座宏伟的工程贡献自己的力量。青年铁工刘建华就是这样。当水库施工进入和洪水决战的紧张阶段时，工地上新到胶轮架子车需用的铁圈很多，没有它车子就不能动，影响施工进展。原来打铁圈要用火烧，很费时间，一天打不了多少个。刘建华越想越着急，如果不提高工效，就不能适应水库建设的需要。怎么办呢？他和青年工人万茂两人，就大胆设想，在休息的时间试验，有时他们晚上不睡觉。经过多次试验，最后终于使制铁圈的效率比原来提高了六十六倍。他还苦心钻研给工地试制成了虎头钳、珠碗子等当地买不到的东西，大大解决了施工中的困难。
    我在工地上访问了不少像马保英、苏克莲、刘建华这样的人。他们都是普通的农民，普通的青年人，普通的妇女，但他们都被一种美好的理想鼓舞着，那就是把干旱的山区建设成美丽、幸福的山区。
