Saving Labor to Support Agricultural Production
Wugang County's Indigenous Mechanization of Grain and Oil Processing

(Reported by this newspaper) Wugang County, Hunan Province, has achieved indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain and oil processing. From September of last year to the end of May this year, the county built and put into production 179 hydraulic and animal-powered rice processing plants, and newly built and renovated 26 water-powered mills for processing rice and flour. Currently, farmers are transporting their newly harvested wheat and rapeseed to nearby factories for timely processing. Along the banks of the Zi River, which runs through the entire county, the roar of grain and oil processing machinery can be heard everywhere.

After Wugang County basically achieved indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain and oil processing, work efficiency was greatly improved, and a large number of laborers were saved and put into agricultural production. At present, the number of commune members participating in grain and oil processing throughout the county has decreased from about 10,000 in the past to about 1,000. The annual labor days for grain and oil processing will also be reduced from about 3 million in the past to about 300,000, which strongly supports the ongoing movement to achieve a thousand catties per mu in grain production.

Wugang County is a mountainous area. In the past, grain and oil crops were processed with backward tools such as earthen mortars, stone mortars, and small stone mills, resulting in low work efficiency and low output. In order to save labor and meet the needs of the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the county launched indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain and oil processing from the end of September last year in conjunction with water conservancy construction.

In realizing the indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization of grain and oil processing, all localities resolutely implemented the principle of "mainly indigenous, combining indigenous and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials," deeply mobilized the masses, carried out technical innovation movements, and overcame difficulties such as the lack of power, equipment, labor, technicians, raw materials, and funds. The county has made a total of eighteen technical innovations in processing tools and operations. With the assistance and technical guidance of the water conservancy department, wooden propeller-type water turbines were first manufactured, breaking through the power bottleneck. Later, through mobilizing the masses, the original animal-powered universal gear disc was improved. Currently, the use of water turbines as power to drive rice mills has been widely promoted. With only two people to supervise, 5,000 catties of rice can be produced per day, increasing work efficiency by 22 times compared to manual operation in the past (in the past, two people processed 220 catties of rice per day). Animal-powered automated rice processing plants, with two people and one cow, can process 1,200 catties of rice per day, which is also nearly five times more efficient than manual operation.

Recently, the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau and the Tool Reform Committee held an on-the-spot meeting on grain and oil processing tool reform in Wugang County with more than 300 participants. The meeting summarized the experience of Wugang County and required all parts of the province to earnestly study this experience and further carry out grain and oil processing tool reform work in combination with current production.

### 节省劳力支援农业生产  武冈县粮油加工土机械化

    节省劳力支援农业生产
    武冈县粮油加工土机械化
    本报讯　湖南武冈县实现粮油加工土机械化和半机械化。从去年9月到今年5月底止，全县建成投入生产的水力和畜力大米加工厂有一百七十九座，新建和改建的水碾加工米面厂二十六座。目前，农民们正把自己新收的麦子和油菜运到就近的工厂里去及时加工。在横贯全县的资江两岸，到处都可以听到粮油加工机械转动的轰鸣声。
    武冈县基本实现粮油加工土机械化、半机械化以后，大大提高了工效，节省了大批劳力投入了农业生产。目前，全县每天参加粮油加工的社员已由过去一万名左右减少到了一千名左右。全年的粮油加工劳动日也将由原来的三百万个左右减少到三十万个左右，有力地支援了正在开展的粮食千斤丰产运动。
    武冈县是一个山区，过去粮食和油料都是用土砻子、石臼、小石磨等落后工具加工的，工效很低，产量不高。为了节省劳动力，满足工农业生产大发展的需要，全县从去年9月底起就结合兴修水利，开展了粮油加工土机械化和半机械化的工作。
    在实现粮油加工的土机械化和半机械化中，各地坚决贯彻了“以土为主、土洋结合、因地制宜、就地取材”的方针，深入发动群众，开展技术革新运动，克服了缺少动力、设备、劳力、技术人员、原材料和资金等困难。全县在加工工具和操作方面的技术革新共有十八种。在水利部门的协助和技术指导下，首先制成了木制旋桨式水轮机，突破了动力关。后来，又通过发动群众，改良了原有的畜力万能齿盘。目前已普遍推行用水轮机作动力，带动碾米机，只要两个人看管，每天可出大米五千斤，比过去用人工操作时提高工效二十二倍（过去两个人每天加工大米二百二十斤）。畜力自动化加工米厂两个人、一头牛，每天可加工大米一千二百斤，与手工操作比较也提高工效近五倍。
    最近，湖南省粮食厅和工具改革委员会在武冈县召开了一个有三百多人参加的粮油加工工具改革现场会，总结了武冈县的经验，要求全省各地认真学习这个经验，结合当前生产，进一步开展粮油加工工具改革工作。
