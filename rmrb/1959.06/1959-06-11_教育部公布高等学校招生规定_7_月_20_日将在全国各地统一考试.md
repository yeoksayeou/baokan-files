Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China issued regulations regarding the enrollment of new students into universities in 1959.

In 1959, the university enrollment work should, on the basis of the work in 1958, continue to implement the principle of Party committee leadership, continue to implement the class line, conscientiously implement the principle of ensuring enrollment quality according to the school's situation, and complete the enrollment plan of various types of universities.

Based on the above requirements, the following regulations are made for this year's university enrollment:

I. University enrollment will adopt a combination of unified leadership and decentralized implementation. Each province, city, and autonomous region will handle enrollment work according to these regulations and the unified deployment of relevant enrollment work, adapting to local conditions. Under the leadership of the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region Party committees and People's Committees, the education departments (bureaus) and higher education bureaus (departments) of each province, city, and autonomous region will, in conjunction with relevant departments, organize universities in the province, city, and autonomous region to establish enrollment agencies to uniformly handle various enrollment tasks in the province, city, and autonomous region.

Schools with special requirements for enrollment examinations may enroll students independently.

All universities that enroll students should carry out enrollment work under the unified leadership of the local Party committee and enrollment agency.

II. The number of students enrolled by schools under the leadership of various central departments in each province, city, and autonomous region, and the number of students adjusted from provinces and cities with a large number of candidates to support provinces, cities, and autonomous regions with insufficient candidates, will be determined by the Ministry of Education in consultation with relevant provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and relevant schools to formulate adjustment plans. A small number of adjustments for mutual enrollment between provinces, cities, and autonomous regions will be decided by the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions themselves.

The universities and departments (specialties) that enroll students in each province, city, and autonomous region will be announced to the candidates by the enrollment agencies of each province, city, and autonomous region before registration.

III. Any citizen of the People's Republic of China who has a high school graduation or equivalent cultural level, and is under the age of thirty (the age of workers, peasants, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and on-the-job cadres can be appropriately relaxed in various places), and meets one of the following conditions, can apply to take the university entrance examination:

　　(1) This year's graduates of senior high schools who hold a letter of introduction from the middle school;

　　(2) This year's graduates of secondary specialized schools who have been approved by the competent business department or local education administrative department to pursue further education, and hold a letter of introduction from the school;

　　(3) On-the-job personnel of Party and government organs, institutions, enterprises, mass organizations, etc., who have been approved by their work units and hold a letter of introduction from their work units;

　　(4) Transferred soldiers, demobilized soldiers, and veterans who hold a certificate from the civil affairs department above the county level (or district in large and medium-sized cities) of their place of origin or from a unit above the regimental level of the troops;

　　(5) Returned overseas Chinese students and students from Hong Kong and Macau who hold a certificate from a domestic overseas Chinese affairs agency or the "Hong Kong and Macau High School Graduates Returning to Guangzhou for Further Education Guidance Committee";

　　(6) Other educated youth who hold a certificate from a people's commune or a People's Committee above the district level.

IV. This year's university enrollment is divided into three categories of examinations according to different types of majors, and the following subjects will be tested separately:

　　(1) Various science and engineering majors (including geography departments of normal colleges and universities, natural geography majors of comprehensive universities), agricultural production mechanization, agricultural meteorology, land planning, farmland water conservancy, agricultural physics, agricultural chemistry, agricultural electrification, agricultural machinery design and manufacturing, forest harvesting and transportation, waterway transportation, forest harvesting and transportation machinery, forestry machinery manufacturing, forest product chemical technology, wood mechanical processing, industrial fishing, aquatic product processing and other majors of agricultural and forestry colleges, and pharmacy majors of medical colleges, are tested in the following subjects: Chinese Language, Politics, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Foreign Language.

　　(2) Various medical, agricultural, and forestry majors (excluding the majors listed in (1)), biology departments, physical education departments, and psychology majors are tested in the following subjects: Chinese Language, Politics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Foreign Language.

　　(3) Various arts, history, political science and law, finance and economics, and art majors, and economic geography majors of comprehensive universities, are tested in the following subjects: Chinese Language, Politics, History, Geography, and Foreign Language.

For candidates applying for various finance and economics majors, economic geography majors, and philosophy majors, an additional mathematics test will be given (professional cadres engaged in financial and economic work who are applying for various finance and economics majors can apply for exemption from the mathematics test). The additional test subjects for candidates applying for art, sports, and other majors (departments) with special requirements will be determined by the relevant schools themselves.

The foreign language examination is divided into Russian and English, and candidates can choose one according to their studies. Those who have not studied a foreign language can apply for exemption from the examination. However, candidates applying for foreign language majors cannot apply for exemption.

V. The unified university entrance examination is scheduled to be held on July 20th. The date of the examination for universities that enroll students independently will be determined by the schools themselves.

VI. The establishment of examination areas and examination halls will be determined by the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions themselves and announced to the candidates.

VII. The principle for universities to enroll new students is: under the premise of ensuring political quality, combining the candidate's academic performance and health conditions, select the best for admission.

For workers, peasants, worker-peasant cadres, and veteran cadres, a method of selection and recommendation for application is implemented. Selected and recommended students do not participate in the national unified examination, and the schools accepting the selected and recommended students conduct separate examinations. The selection and recommendation method is the responsibility of the educational administrative departments of each province, city, and autonomous region.

For workers, peasants, worker-peasant cadres, as well as demobilized and transferred soldiers, on-the-job cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for a long time, ethnic minorities, children of martyrs, overseas Chinese students, Hong Kong and Macau students, etc., who participate in the unified examination without being selected and recommended, a preferential admission method is adopted.

VIII. All expenses of various candidates during the application period shall be borne by themselves. The travel expenses to the school after admission will be issued by the work unit (school) for on-the-job personnel, transferred soldiers, and this year's graduates of secondary specialized schools; the travel expenses to the school for other new students should in principle be borne by themselves, and individual students who are indeed unable to raise the travel expenses due to long distances and family financial difficulties can apply for subsidies from the enrollment agencies or local education administrative departments of their province, city, and autonomous region.

IX. After new students enter the university, the university should immediately conduct political and health re-examinations; those who fail the re-examination will have their admission qualifications revoked.

X. The enrollment agencies of each province, city, and autonomous region and schools that enroll students independently, based on these regulations and in combination with the specific requirements of the province, city, and autonomous region and the school, will formulate separate enrollment brochures and announce them to the candidates.
