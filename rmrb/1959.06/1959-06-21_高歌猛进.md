Leaping Forward with Songs
Zhang Shigong, First Secretary of the CPC Yili District Committee, Secretary Zhao Huaibi

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and illuminated by the Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, the 800,000 people of all ethnic groups in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture have undergone profound changes and achieved brilliant victories in political, economic, cultural, and other construction endeavors over the past few years.

The Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture is vast and rich in resources, covering an area of more than 350,000 square kilometers. In the Yili River and Ertix River basins, the climate is warm, and there are boundless fertile lands suitable for planting various crops, of which only one-sixth is currently cultivated. In the mountainous areas, there are vast grasslands and natural seasonal pastures with abundant water and grass, making them ideal for developing animal husbandry. The deep mountains are covered with dense forests and wild fruit forests spreading all over the mountains and plains. These forests are also home to many economically valuable and precious wild animals and plants, producing velvet antlers, musk, antelope horns, bezoar, safflower, fritillary bulbs, and various precious animal skins. Various fresh fish are abundant in some rivers, the most famous being the Altai sturgeon, which can weigh up to 60 or 70 kilograms. As for mineral deposits, the reserves of coal, iron, gold, silver, tungsten, other non-ferrous metals, and rare metals are very rich. The famous Karamay oilfield is located within the autonomous prefecture. These superior natural conditions and abundant resources are favorable for the working people of all ethnic groups in the Yili area to develop economic construction.

However, before liberation, under the bloody rule, national oppression, and cruel exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, this rich land presented a scene of desolation and misery. The level of agricultural production was extremely low. The main production tool for farmers was a "soil cutting trowel," and many people used wooden plows to cultivate the land and sowed seeds on horseback. Herders lived a nomadic life, traversing mountains and rivers all year round. Industrial production was even more out of the question.

With the implementation of the Party's various policies in ethnic minority areas and the development of various social reform movements, the face of the Yili area has been constantly changing. In 1953, on the basis of completing the reform of the land system in agricultural areas, mutual aid and cooperation organizations gradually developed, enabling agricultural and pastoral production to improve year by year on a new economic basis of mutual support and mutual promotion. The establishment of the autonomous prefecture in November 1954 realized the long-cherished aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups, fully exercised their right to be masters of their own affairs, and brought the political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings of the autonomous prefecture into a new historical stage of development. Fundamental changes have taken place in the vast rural and pastoral areas. In particular, in 1958, like other parts of the country, the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture also achieved rapid development in various socialist construction endeavors. Over the past few years, our agricultural production increase policy has been to continuously improve the yield per unit area by taking various measures, while also expanding the planting area by utilizing all favorable conditions. Now, the prefecture's cultivated land area has reached 6.43 million mu, an increase of 2.92 million mu compared to 1949. Cultivation methods have also been continuously improved. The prefecture has basically achieved animal-drawn agricultural mechanization. The extensive farming methods of sowing seeds on horseback without fertilization or weeding have been fundamentally eliminated. Row planting and inter-tillage have been accepted by the masses, and as a result, the output of grain and other crops has increased year by year. In 1958, the total output of various grains exceeded one billion jin, an increase of 270% compared to 1949. The average grain yield per mu was 192 jin, an increase of 85% compared to 1949. In addition, many high-yield fields with yields of over 1,000 jin have emerged in various places.

In areas that were originally dominated by animal husbandry, with the progress of social reform and the change of production relations, animal husbandry has shifted from individual management to collective management. This has created conditions for unified planning and use of grasslands and saving a large number of laborers to invest in agricultural production, ensuring that herders have a more adequate supply of grain and livestock feed, thereby ensuring that animal husbandry can develop better. In this way, the historical contradictions between agriculture and animal husbandry have been transformed into mutual support and joint advancement. Now, the total number of livestock in the prefecture has reached nearly seven million head, an increase of 110% compared to 1949. At the same time, in developing animal husbandry production, leaders at all levels and the masses in the autonomous prefecture have not only paid attention to the increase in quantity, but also emphasized the improvement of quality. The Yili horse, which is both suitable for riding and draft, and the Xinjiang sheep, which are both wool and meat producing, which are being promoted throughout the country, originate from the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture.

In the past, herders followed their livestock in search of water and grass, not only suffering from poor economic conditions but also a lack of political and cultural life. Adults could not escape the pain of illiteracy, and children of school age could not attend school. With the common development of agricultural and pastoral production, especially the development of agricultural production, the settlement of herders has been promoted. At present, all pastoral areas have settlements, and most of them have been built according to plans. There are not only houses, but also schools, clinics, and clubs. This not only ensures the continuous improvement of the economic life of the people of all ethnic groups, but also provides conditions for improving the political and cultural life of the masses in pastoral areas. Now, the number of secondary schools in the prefecture has increased from 13 in 1949 to 47, and the total number of students in primary and secondary schools is more than 114,600, an increase of 93% compared to 1949. The development of private primary schools has been even faster. In 1958, the number of students enrolled increased sevenfold compared to 1957, and eight counties have already universalized primary school education. At the same time, the living and sanitary conditions of the masses have been greatly improved, and the incidence of various infectious diseases has decreased significantly. Malaria, which used to be the most serious epidemic in the Yili area, has been greatly reduced. This plays a significant role in protecting the health of the people of all ethnic groups and improving labor efficiency.

Driven by agricultural and pastoral production, the industry of the autonomous prefecture is also flourishing. In particular, the large-scale steelmaking campaign last winter laid a strong ideological, organizational, and material foundation for the future development of industrial production. In the past, the Yili area did not produce a single jin of iron or an inch of steel, and all the steel used was supported by other regions. Now, there are not only processing factories for flour, oil extraction, and fur, but also coking, copper smelting, iron smelting, and steelmaking plants. It can not only repair and assemble general machinery, but also manufacture relatively sophisticated machine tools. What is particularly exciting is the small steel plant newly built on the grassland—the Xinyuan Steel Plant, which, shortly after its establishment, entered the ranks of advanced small blast furnaces in the country. This has a very practical educational significance for eliminating mystical views in people's minds and establishing a communist style of daring to think and daring to do.

The Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture is a multi-ethnic region, so it is necessary to strengthen ethnic unity. Adhering to the struggle between the two lines, opposing bourgeois nationalism, and developing socialist ethnic relations are important guarantees for the successful construction of socialism. In the past few years, farmers and herders of all ethnic groups have become more closely and firmly united politically, economically, and emotionally due to their organized joint labor, mutual learning, and mutual assistance. From their own personal experience, the people of all ethnic groups deeply understand that the leadership of the Communist Party and the assistance of all fraternal ethnic groups, especially the Han people, are the lifeline of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture, and that consolidating national unity and strengthening ethnic unity are the sources of their happiness. In particular, after thoroughly crushing the rampant attacks of local nationalist elements in the autonomous prefecture last year, the ability of the vast number of cadres and the masses to distinguish between right and wrong has been greatly enhanced, their socialist and communist consciousness has been further improved, their understanding has been unified, obstacles to advancement have been removed, and the unity of the people of all ethnic groups has been established on a new and unbreakable foundation. The beautiful scenery of the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture today is only a part of our great socialist and communist construction cause. We are determined to build the autonomous prefecture into one of the country's industrial bases for non-ferrous metals, textiles, and sugar refining, to build the autonomous prefecture into a base for fine breeding livestock and animal husbandry, and to build the autonomous prefecture into a "land of fruits and flowers" full of fragrance and birdsong everywhere.

    高歌猛进
    中共伊犁区委员会第一书记  张世功  书记  赵怀璧
    伊犁哈萨克族自治州八十万各族人民，几年来在中国共产党的领导下，在党和毛主席的民族政策光辉照耀下，无论在政治、经济、文化和其他各项生产建设事业上，都经历了极为深刻的变化，赢得了辉煌的胜利。
    伊犁哈萨克族自治州幅员广阔，资源丰富。它的面积有三十五万多平方公里。在伊犁河和额尔齐斯河流域，气候温暖，有着适宜于种植各种农作物的一望无际的肥沃土地，现在已耕种的土地只不过是可耕地的六分之一；在山区，有着广阔的草原和水草丰美的天然四季牧场，是发展畜牧业最理想的地方；在深山里则布满绿荫遮天的大森林和漫山遍野的野生果林。在这些森林里，还有许多富有经济价值的名贵野生动物植物，生产鹿茸、麝香、羚羊角、牛黄、红花、贝母以及各种珍贵的兽皮；在一些河里，盛产各种鲜鱼，最著名的阿尔泰青黄鱼，有重达六、七十公斤的。至于矿藏，煤、铁、金、银、钨等有色金属和稀有金属的蕴藏量都很丰富。驰名中外的克拉玛依油田就在自治州境内。这些优越的自然条件和富饶的资源，是伊犁地区各族劳动人民发展经济建设事业的有利条件。
    但是，解放以前，在国民党反动派的血腥统治，民族压迫和残酷压榨剥削下，这块富饶的土地上却是一派凄惨、荒凉的景象，农业生产水平十分低下，农民的主要生产工具是一把砍土镘，而且有很多人是用木犁耕地，骑马撒种；牧民们终年过着跋山涉水的游牧生活。至于工业生产就更谈不到了。
    随着党在民族地区各项政策的贯彻执行，各项社会改革运动的开展，伊犁地区的面貌就不断地在变化。1953年在完成农业区改革土地制度的基础上，互助合作组织逐步发展起来，使农牧业生产在互相支援、互相促进的新的经济基础上，逐年得到提高。1954年11月自治州成立，实现了各族人民多年来的愿望，充分发挥了他们当家作主的权利，使自治州的政治、经济、文化等项事业，又步入一个新的历史发展阶段，广大农村、牧区的面貌发生了根本的变化。特别是1958年，伊犁哈萨克族自治州也和全国其他各地一样，各项社会主义建设都得到突飞猛进的发展。几年来我们在农业上的增产方针是：既设法采取种种措施不断提高单位面积产量，同时也利用一切有利条件扩大种植面积。现在全州耕地面积已经达到六百四十三万亩，比1949年扩大了二百九十二万亩。在耕作措施上也不断得到改进，全州已经基本实现马拉农具化，以往那种骑马撒种、不施肥、不除草的粗放作法，已经根本消除，条播、中耕已经为广大群众所接受，因而粮食和其他农作物的产量都逐年上升。1958年各种粮食总产量十亿多斤，比1949年增加了270％。粮食每亩平均产量为一百九十二斤，比1949年提高了85％。此外，各地还出现了不少千斤以上的高额丰产田。
    在原来以牧业为主的地区，随着社会改革的进行和生产关系的改变，畜牧业由过去的个体经营转变为集体经营，这就为统一规划和使用草场、节省大批劳动力投入农业生产创造了条件，使牧民的粮食和牲畜的饲草、饲料都得到了比较充分的供应，从而也保证了畜牧业能够更好地向前发展。这样，也使历史上所遗留下来的农牧业的相互矛盾改变为相互支援，并肩跃进。现在，全州各种牲畜已经达到近七百万头，比1949年增加了110％。同时在发展牧业生产上，自治州各级领导和广大群众不仅注意了数量的增加，而且重视了质量的提高。现在，全国各地正在推广的乘挽兼用的伊犁马和毛肉兼用的新疆羊，就出自伊犁哈萨克族自治州。
    过去，牧民们都是跟着畜群逐水草而居，不仅经济生活穷困，政治、文化生活更为贫乏，成年人摆脱不了文盲的痛苦，适龄儿童不得入学。随着农牧业生产的共同发展，特别是农业生产的发展，促进了牧民的定居。目前，各个牧业区都有了定居点，而且大部分是按照规划建设起来的。不仅有住房，还设立了学校、卫生所、俱乐部。这样，既保证了各族人民的经济生活不断改善，也有条件提高牧区群众的政治、文化生活。现在，全州的中等学校已经由1949年的十三所增加到四十七所，中、小学在校学生共有十一万四千六百多人，比1949年增加了93％。民办小学发展更快，1958年在校学生就比1957年增加了七倍，有八个县已经普及了小学教育。同时，群众的居住卫生条件也大大改善，各种传染病的发病率显著下降，以往在伊犁地区流行最严重的疟疾，已经大为减少。这对保护各族人民身体健康、提高劳动效率，起着很大的作用。
    在农牧业生产的推动下，自治州的工业也蒸蒸日上。特别是去冬的大炼钢铁，更为今后发展工业生产打下了强有力的思想、组织和物质基础。伊犁地区过去是斤铁不产，寸钢不出，所用钢铁全靠外地支援。现在，既有面粉、榨油、皮毛等加工厂，还有炼焦、炼铜、炼铁、炼钢厂；既能修配一般的机械，还能制造出比较精细的机床。特别令人兴奋的，是在草原上新建的一座小型钢铁厂——新源钢铁厂，在建立以后不久，就跨进了全国先进小高炉的行列。这对消除人民思想上的神秘观点，树立敢想敢做的共产主义风格，有十分现实的教育意义。
    伊犁哈萨克族自治州是个多民族地区，所以必须加强民族团结。坚持开展两条路线的斗争，反对资产阶级民族主义，发展社会主义的民族关系，是胜利建设社会主义的重要保证。几年来，各族农牧民由于组织起来共同劳动、互相学习、互相帮助，所以，他们在政治上、经济上、思想感情上都进一步亲密和巩固地团结起来了。各族人民从自己的亲身体验中深深懂得，共产党的领导和各兄弟民族首先是汉族人民的帮助，是自治州各族人民的命根子，巩固祖国统一和加强民族团结是自己幸福的源泉。特别是经过去年彻底粉碎了自治州内地方民族主义分子的猖狂进攻以后，使广大干部和群众分辨大是大非的能力大大增强，社会主义和共产主义觉悟更加提高，统一了认识，扫除了前进中的障碍，各族人民的团结就建立在新的牢不可破的基础上。伊犁哈萨克族自治州今天的美好景象只不过是我们伟大的社会主义和共产主义建设事业的一部分，我们决心把自治州建设成为祖国的有色金属、纺织和制糖的工业基地之一，把自治州建设成为优良种畜基地和畜牧业的基地，把自治州建设成为处处芬芳灿烂、鸟语花香的“花果之乡”。
