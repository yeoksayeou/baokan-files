    This newspaper reports that the project to bring the Tao River uphill for irrigation purposes is progressing actively. On this construction site, a mass technical innovation movement has been launched, focusing on solving major technical problems and establishing factories to ensure the supply of materials.

    When the project started in mid-June last year, the civilian laborers (min gong) used tools such as iron shovels, hoes, carrying poles, and dirt baskets, relying on human backs and shoulders for construction. By the end of July, single-wheel carts, three-wheeled automatic dumping carts, and trackless automatic vehicles appeared on the construction site, realizing vehicle transportation. By the end of September, earthwork mechanization was achieved, using soil mechanical tools such as combined harrows, land hovercraft, trackless automatic loading and unloading earth-rock machines, hinged plate soil transport machines, and skid rail transport machines for construction. As of now, the civilian laborers of the Tao River diversion project have manufactured more than 140,000 simple, easy-to-make, and easy-to-operate soil mechanical tools, and invented more than 200 kinds of advanced construction tools and advanced operation methods. "Flying in the sky," "floating on water," and "running underground" are the characteristics of the three-dimensional construction employing all kinds of soil mechanical tools, greatly improving work efficiency. On some construction sites, each person's daily earthwork output reached as high as 76 cubic meters of earth or 78 cubic meters of rock. The entire project has excavated 340 million cubic meters of earth and rock, accounting for about 42.5% of the first phase of the project, completing the originally planned tasks, and the project quality is good.

    This mountain canal, stretching across arid areas with a total main canal length of 1,400 kilometers, is being built on the Loess Plateau. Most of the loess belongs to collapsible loess layers, with low bulk density, low moisture content, high porosity, large permeability coefficient, and strong water permeability. In order to solve the problem of seepage prevention and subsidence prevention of the loess layer throughout the canal, the Tao River Diversion Project Bureau, after research and experimentation, adopted the method of compacting the loess with water to change the original characteristics of the loess, and found that seepage prevention is the main measure and theoretical basis for preventing loess collapsibility.

    On the 600-kilometer canal line of the first phase of the project (from Gucheng to Dayingliang), the original plan was to excavate 53 tunnels, with a total length of 26.5 kilometers. Due to the shortage of tunneling machinery and lining materials, and the huge cost, the Engineering Bureau mobilized all employees to discuss and create a method combining bypass, deep splitting, and bypass splitting to convert the tunnels into open channels. Although this extends the canal line by 180 kilometers and increases the rock excavation by more than one and a half times, it can shorten the construction period, reduce the supply of building materials and mechanical equipment by 73%-90% compared with the original plan, and save about 50% of the state's original investment of 200 million yuan. It can also increase power generation capacity by 35,000 kilowatts, realizing the ideal of "ships traveling on mountains."

    This construction site has established many factories to ensure the high-speed progress of the entire project. As of now, a total of 769 factories of various types, including iron and wood processing, sand casting, iron smelting, building materials, saltpeter, and gunpowder factories, have been built.

    In the process of establishing factories, the workers broke through the "five barriers" (namely: ideological barrier, material barrier, technical barrier, equipment barrier, and funding barrier), overcame countless difficulties, and continuously expanded equipment and technical strength, so that a group of large-scale tool manufacturing and distribution plants and material plants appeared on the entire construction site. In addition to producing complex tools such as soil-carrying dry boats, universal crawler soil-carrying machines, and ball bearings, they also produced high-grade cement and valuable medicines. The Yuzhong work area's iron and wood joint factory originally had only three sand casting workers, a few carpenters, a blower, and a few simple production tools among its 128 workers. Through several months of production while adding equipment, and the method of contracting teaching and learning to bring apprentices, it has trained 89 all-around technicians and 39 general technicians, built 36 factory buildings without spending a penny, and manufactured more than 80 kinds of medium and small iron, wood, and sand casting tools, totaling more than 20,000 pieces.

    Now, in order to achieve water diversion to Dayingliang ahead of schedule, ten types of thirty-five material factories are being actively established and expanded.

    革新技术  自制材料  引洮上山
    本报讯　引洮上山水利工程正积极进行。在这个工地上，开展了群众性的技术改革运动，注意了解决重大的技术问题和开办工厂，保证材料供应。
    去年6月中旬工程开工时，民工用的工具是铁铣、镢头、扁担、土筐，靠人背肩挑进行施工；7月底工地上就出现了单轮车、三轮自动倒土车和无轨自动车等半土机械工具，实现了车辆化；9月底出现了土机械化，用联合耙、陆地滑船、无轮自动装卸土石方两用机、活板运土机、滑杠运输机等等土机械工具施工。截至目前，引洮工程民工们制造的结构简单，制作方便和操作容易的土机械工具十四万余件，发明创造了二百多种先进的施工工具和先进的操作方法，出现了“高空飞”、“水上漂”、“地下跑”全面应用各种土机械工具的立体施工，工效直升，有些工地上每人每天所作土石方竟高达七十六土方或七十八石方。整个工程已挖土石方三亿四千万公方，约占第一期工程的42.5％，完成了原来预定的任务，并且工程质量良好。
    这一条横亘干旱地带，总干渠全长一千四百公里的山上运河，修建在黄土高原上。大部分黄土属于湿陷性黄土层，容重小，含水量低，孔隙率很高，渗透系数大，透水性强。引洮工程局为了解决整个渠道黄土层的防渗漏防沉陷问题，经过研究和试验，采取加水夯实黄土、改变黄土原有特性的办法，找出了防渗漏是防止黄土湿陷的主要措施和理论根据。
    在第一期工程（古城至大营梁）的六百公里渠线上，原计划要开凿五十三座隧洞，总长二十六点五公里，由于凿洞机械、衬砌材料不足，且费用巨大，工程局发动全体职工讨论，创造了绕线、深劈和绕劈相结合的方法，将隧洞改为明渠。这样渠线虽然延长一百八十公里，石方增加一倍半以上，却可缩短工期，使建筑材料和机械设备的供应比原计划减少了73％—90％，国家原计划投资二亿元，也可节约50％左右。并能增加发电能力三万五千瓩，实现“山上行舟”的理想。
    这个工地自办不少工厂，保证了全部工程高速度前进。截至目前，已经兴建起铁木加工、翻砂、炼铁、建筑材料、火硝、火药等各类工厂计七百六十九个。
    在办厂过程中，曾大破“五关”（即：思想关、材料关、技术关、设备关、资金关），克服无数困难，不断扩大了设备和技术力量，使整个工地出现了一批大型工具制配厂、材料厂，除能生产运土旱船、万能履带运土机、滚珠轴承等复杂的工具外，还生产出高标号水泥，贵重药品。榆中工区的铁木联合工厂，原来一百二十八个工人中，只有三个翻砂工，几个木匠，一只鼓风机和几样简单的生产工具，通过几个月的边生产边增添设备，和包教包学带徒弟的办法，已经培养出多面手技工八十九人，一般技工三十九人，不花一文钱修建厂房三十六间，制造了中、小型铁木翻砂工具八十多种，计两万多件。
    现在，为了提前通水大营梁，又在积极兴办和扩建十种三十五个材料工厂。
