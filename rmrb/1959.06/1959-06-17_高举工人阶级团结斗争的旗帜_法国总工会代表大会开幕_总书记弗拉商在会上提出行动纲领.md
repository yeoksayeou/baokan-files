Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 15th. The 32nd Congress of the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) opened on the 14th at the sports hall in Ivry, near Paris. This congress, convened against the backdrop of intensified social contradictions and an unprecedented surge in workers' struggles for their rights in France, is a major event in French political and social life.

　　The congress was opened by Édouard Hénocque, General Secretary of the French National Railway Workers' Federation. The General Secretary of the French CGT, Benoît Frachon, delivered a report at the meeting, analyzing the current situation in France. He said that large capitalist trusts and monopolies have used the most reactionary forces to establish an anti-democratic regime in France, and the division of the working class and the cowardice and betrayal of those parliamentarians and politicians who call themselves democrats have helped the reactionary forces achieve their goals. Frachon pointed out that the role and responsibility of the largest trade union organization in France—the French CGT—is now more important than ever before.

　　Frachon, citing CGT data, said that since the government promulgated measures attacking the living standards of the masses last December, the cost of living has risen by 6.5%; while since mid-1957, real wages have fallen by 12%. Frachon pointed out that the government's anti-democratic measures that strike at the living standards of the masses have aroused opposition not only from the working class, but also from broad strata of working people.

　　Frachon then spoke about the widespread strike movement, saying that in the past few months, the struggle waged by the working class to win their economic and social rights has developed, and they have made significant efforts to overcome obstacles and prejudices that are detrimental to their unity. Strikes have erupted in various sectors, with strikers demanding higher wages, allowances, and relief payments, protesting against layoffs and factory closures, and defending the social insurance system.

　　Frachon presented the outline of the French CGT's action program to the congress.

　　Finally, Frachon spoke about the importance of trade union organization work, saying that the number of trade union members in France is small. The French CGT has 1.6 million members, and other national trade unions have far fewer members than the CGT. The decrease in the number of organized workers is one of the results of the division of the working class. Frachon said that despite the persecution of trade union activists by employers and the government, and despite the slander against the CGT by the bourgeois press and radio, the French CGT remains the largest trade union in France and enjoys great trust from the working class.

    高举工人阶级团结斗争的旗帜
    法国总工会代表大会开幕
    总书记弗拉商在会上提出行动纲领
    据新华社巴黎15日电　法国总工会三十二次代表大会14日在巴黎附近伊符里市的体育馆开幕。在法国社会矛盾激化和工人争取权利的斗争空前高涨的情况下召开的这次代表大会，是法国政治和社会生活中的重大事件。
    大会由法国全国铁路员工联合会总书记埃尼主持开幕。法国总工会总书记弗拉商在会上作了报告，他分析了法国目前的情况，他说，大资本托拉斯和大垄断资本已经利用最反动的力量在法国建立了反民主的政权，工人阶级的分裂和那些号称民主分子的议员和政治家的懦弱和叛卖，帮助反动势力达到了目的。弗拉商指出，法国最大的工会组织——法国总工会的作用和责任现在比过去任何时期更重要了。
    弗拉商引用总工会的材料说，自从去年12月政府颁布了进攻群众的生活水平的措施以来，生活费用已经上涨6.5％；而从1957年年中以来，实际工资已经降低了12％。弗拉商指出，政府的打击群众的生活水准的反民主措施，不仅引起工人阶级，而且也引起广泛阶层的劳动人民的反对。
    弗拉商接着谈到了广泛的罢工运动，他说，在过去几个月中，工人阶级进行的争取他们的经济和社会权利的斗争已经有了发展，他们作了重大努力以克服有害于他们的团结的阻碍和成见。在各部门中都爆发了罢工，罢工者要求提高工资、津贴和救济金，抗议停工和关闭工厂、保卫社会保险制度。
    弗拉商向大会提出了法国总工会的行动纲领的大纲。
    弗拉商最后谈到工会组织工作的重要性，他说，法国工会会员的数目是不多的，法国总工会有一百六十万会员，别的全国性工会会员比总工会要少得多，有组织的工人的人数的减少，是工人阶级分裂所造成的结果之一。弗拉商说，尽管企业主和政府对工会积极分子横加迫害，尽管资产阶级报纸和广播对总工会进行诽谤，法国总工会仍然是法国最大的工会，并且受到工人阶级的巨大的信任。
