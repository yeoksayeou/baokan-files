Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: The Ministry of Agriculture today issued an emergency notice on launching a summer fertilizer accumulation and production campaign.

The notice said that the crops are emerging well now, and there is an urgent need for topdressing. The summer sowing area has been expanded in various places, and a large amount of base fertilizer and topdressing are also needed. Therefore, doing everything possible to solve the fertilizer problem has become the most prominent measure to strive for an overall increase in agricultural production.

The notice pointed out: Now is a great time to accumulate and produce fertilizer in large quantities. The fields are green everywhere, and the sources of fertilizer are much richer than in winter and spring, and the fertilizer rots faster. We should seize this favorable opportunity and launch a summer fertilizer accumulation and production campaign with the mobilization of every household and the participation of everyone.

The notice requires: (1) In the South, the masses should be mobilized to collect large quantities of mountain green manure, cut lake grass, kill green manure and compost it, or step on the green manure in combination with the mid-tillage. Coastal areas can also collect a lot of sea fertilizer. Where conditions permit in the North, green grass composting can also be carried out. In general areas, high-temperature composting should be vigorously promoted. All localities should combine with the summer sanitation campaign to mobilize community members to collect a large amount of household fertilizer, stable manure, and accumulate and utilize various miscellaneous fertilizers. The human excrement, garbage, and sewage of cities and industrial and mining areas must be actively sought to be fully utilized as fertilizer.

Vigorously developing pig raising and fertilizer accumulation is still the main way to solve the fertilizer shortage and improve the quality of fertilizer. Feed plots must be allocated to community members to facilitate the large-scale development of private pig and poultry raising. If the feed plots have not been allocated, they should be quickly allocated to households and planted with feed crops immediately. And give practical consideration to the supply of piglets, feed relief, and labor time arrangements to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses in raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer.

In order to prepare base fertilizer for autumn and winter sowing crops, green manure should be planted on barren mountains and wastelands. In areas where there is a habit of intercropping short-term summer green manure, efforts should be made to plant more green manure crops, which should be turned over as base fertilizer during autumn plowing.

Fertilization should focus on balanced yield increase and comprehensive harvest, pay attention to economic benefits, and carry out multiple, batch-by-batch, seedling-based, and field-based topdressing, and do not concentrate on one point and ignore the overall situation.

The use of chemical fertilizers should focus on cotton and other important cash crops. It is hoped that provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions will appropriately control them.

(2) Summer farming is busy and labor is tight. In order to ensure the success of fertilizer accumulation, labor time must be planned and properly arranged, and the combination of universal mobilization of the masses to accumulate and produce fertilizer and the establishment of professional organizations to regularly accumulate and produce fertilizer must be combined. Seize every slack in farming to carry out short-term concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaigns to solve the fertilizer problem in stages. In order to ensure the implementation of the task, it is also necessary to establish a fertilizer accumulation and production responsibility system, implement cadre-in-charge areas, community member-in-charge plots, and accumulate and produce the fertilizer required for each plot of land according to quality, quantity, and time.

Regardless of collective fertilizer accumulation or community member family fertilizer accumulation, the principle of paying according to labor and more pay for more work must be resolutely implemented. The best way for collective fertilizer accumulation is to implement a quota plus bonus payment method. Purchasing fertilizers accumulated and produced by community member families should record work points according to quality and quantity, or reasonably price them, and it is best to pay a certain amount of cash to encourage the enthusiasm of community members in accumulating fertilizer.

(3) In the summer fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, we must also seize the opportunity to do a good job in several basic construction projects for fertilizer accumulation and production, and prepare conditions for year-round fertilizer accumulation and production. Universally establish field composting pits, build toilets (including public and family toilets), and livestock pens. According to the fertilizer resource situation and technical equipment conditions, increase the production of native chemical fertilizers. The existing native chemical fertilizer plants should be rectified according to their respective situations. Those with high fertilizer efficiency and low cost should be vigorously developed; those with high fertilizer efficiency and high cost can be produced less or not produced; those that use fertilizer to produce fertilizer, waste labor, and do not pay off should be stopped. In order to expand the planting area of winter green manure crops, seed preparation should be done early.

### 抓住时机大积大造夏肥  农业部号召人人动手户户动员给夏秋作物吃饱吃好

    抓住时机大积大造夏肥
    农业部号召人人动手户户动员给夏秋作物吃饱吃好
    新华社10日讯　农业部今日发出了关于开展夏季积肥造肥运动的紧急通知。
    通知说，现在农作物出苗良好，迫切需要追肥。各地夏播面积扩大，也要大量底肥和追肥。因此，当前千方百计解决肥料问题，已成为争取农业全面增产的最突出的一项措施。
    通知指出：目前正是大量积肥造肥的大好时机，遍野皆青，肥源比冬季和春季要丰富得多，肥料腐熟的也快。应该抓住这个有利时机，开展一个户户动员，人人动手的夏季积肥造肥运动。
    通知要求：（一）南方应该发动群众大量打山青、割湖草、刹青沤肥，或结合中耕进行踩青。沿海地区还可以大量搜集海肥。北方有条件的地方也可以搞青草沤肥，一般地方应当大力推行高温堆肥。各地都应该结合夏季卫生运动，发动社员大量收集家肥、厩肥，积攒利用各种杂肥等。城市和工矿区的人粪尿、垃圾、污水等，一定要积极设法充分利用起来，作为肥料。
    大量发展养猪积肥，还是解决肥料不足而且也是提高肥料质量的主要途径。必须拨给社员饲料地，以利于大量发展私人养猪和家禽，饲料地还没有拨下去的，要赶快拨到户，马上种上饲料作物。并且在仔猪供应、饲料接济以及劳动时间安排上切实给以照顾，把群众养猪积肥的积极性充分调动起来。
    为了给秋冬播作物准备底肥，要利用荒山、荒地种植绿肥，在有套种夏季短期绿肥习惯的地区，要争取多种一些绿肥作物，秋耕时翻作底肥。
    施肥应该从平衡增产、全面丰收着眼，注意经济效果，进行多次、分批、看苗、看田追肥，不要集中一点，忽视全面。
    化肥的使用应该重点放在棉花和其他重要的经济作物方面，希望各省、市、自治区适当加以掌握。
      （二）夏季农活忙、劳力紧张，为了保证搞好积肥工作，必须有计划地妥善安排劳动时间，普遍发动群众积肥造肥与成立专业组织经常进行积肥造肥相结合。抓住每一个农闲空隙开展短期的突击积肥运动，分段解决肥料问题。为了保证任务落实，还要建立积肥、造肥责任制度，实行干部包片，社员包丘，按质、按量、按时积造每丘田所需的肥料。
    不论集体积肥或社员家庭积肥，都必须坚决贯彻按劳计酬，多劳多得的原则。集体积肥最好是实行定额加奖励计酬的办法。收购社员家庭积造的肥料，要按质按量记工，或者合理作价，最好能付给一定数量的现款，以鼓励社员积肥的积极性。
      （三）在夏季积肥造肥运动中，也要抓紧搞好几项积肥造肥的基本建设，为常年积肥造肥准备条件。普遍建立田头沤肥坑、修建厕所（包括公共的和家庭的）、牲畜圈栏。根据肥料资源的情况和技术设备条件，增加土化肥的生产。对现有的土化肥厂，应当分别情况加以整顿，肥效高成本低的要大力发展；肥效高成本也高的可以少搞或不搞，以肥制肥、白花劳力、得不偿失的应该停止。为了扩大冬季绿肥作物的种植面积，应该早作好种子的准备工作。
