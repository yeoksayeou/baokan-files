County Party Secretary Shi Xiuhua
By our correspondents Huang Shengpu and Zhou Rong

    Under the light drizzle in the rice paddies of Yueyan Commune, Daoxian County, Hunan Province, a person wearing gray cloth clothing was carefully observing the growth of rice seedlings. The commune members, who were applying fast-acting, temperature-retaining fertilizer to the seedlings, recognized him from afar as Shi Xiuhua, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee. As he approached, commune member He Kangchen warmly greeted him: "Secretary Shi, you're here again!" "Yes, I'm here again to see your seedlings," Secretary Shi replied cordially, while touching the seedlings and examining them carefully. He noticed that the stems were not yet strong enough and picked up a handful of soil to examine it closely. Clearly, the base fertilizer was almost completely decomposed, no wonder the commune members were applying fertilizer in the rain! That evening, Secretary Shi invited these commune members to discuss new measures for further improving production, and the meeting did not break up until late at night.

    Knowing the People, Familiar with the Land

    Comrade Shi Xiuhua came south from Hebei Province and has been working in Daoxian County for nearly ten years. Each year, he spends three-quarters of his time with the masses, learning about production and providing on-the-spot guidance. Whether it is the scorching summer or the snowy and icy winter, he goes to the countryside as usual. Over the past ten years, he has visited dozens of villages and courtyards throughout the county, familiarizing himself with the soil quality and irrigation conditions of tens of thousands of fields. Many white-haired elders and young children among the masses know him and greet him warmly as "Secretary Shi" when they meet. More than a hundred li from the county seat, there is a large cave where more than a dozen households live. In the past, they only grew coarse grains on the mountains, and few outsiders had ever been there. But Secretary Shi went there, helped them develop a production plan, and organized a team of young people to go down the mountain to grow rice, increasing grain production. Comrade Shi Xiuhua has traveled all over the county in this way, mastering a great deal of information.

    Knowing the people and being familiar with the land is so important for guiding and rationally arranging the county's production! During the spring plowing season last year, Comrade Shi Xiuhua saw that the yield of rice grown on a piece of land in Qingxi Commune was very low, so he discussed with the commune members about trying to grow peanuts. They planted 400 mu of peanuts, which surprisingly increased production, with an average yield of 800 jin per mu, increasing income by two to three times compared to growing rice. This year, the area planted with peanuts has been expanded to 650 mu. Commune member Li Zude said, "Secretary Shi does more good things for the masses every year."

    Searching for "Thoroughbred Horses"

    In every production link, Comrade Shi Xiuhua pays attention to going deep among the masses, discovering advanced experiences, and finding advanced individuals. People call this activity of his searching for "thoroughbred horses."

    This year, while participating in rice transplanting in the countryside, he saw that each person could only transplant a little more than one fen of land per day on average, and the work efficiency was very low. However, this year, the close planting specifications of 3x5 inches and 3x6 inches have been widely promoted. According to the current transplanting progress, the entire county would be delayed by at least one season before the rice could be transplanted completely and with the required quality. He was very worried, and the masses were also very anxious.

    "Go find 'thoroughbred horses'!" So he went among the masses to seek out talented and capable people. When he discovered that Shen Xilian, an eighteen-year-old female Communist Party member from Chetou Commune, could transplant 52,000 seedlings a day, he was overjoyed and immediately led the Party Committee Secretaries of eleven communes and relevant agricultural technicians to Chetou Commune to ask Shen Xilian to introduce her experience and give a live demonstration. He and the Commune Party Committee Secretaries carefully observed Shen Xilian's left hand, which held the bunch of seedlings close to the water surface, with her thumb, index finger, and middle finger flexibly separating the seedlings, while her right hand only needed to transplant them into the field, as quickly as a chicken pecking rice. She transplanted from right to left, and from left to right again, without shaking her head, saving round-trip time. At the same time, Xilian's feet stepped diagonally into the mud, so she didn't need to use her hands to smooth the footprint when retreating. In this way, the experience of high-efficiency rice transplanting was summarized. Shen Xilian's experience was widely taught, and 50,800 skilled rice transplanters were trained. As a result, the transplanting progress per person per day in the county increased from just over one fen of land to more than five fen of land, and there were 4,000 people who could transplant one mu of land per day. As a result, early rice was transplanted more than twenty days earlier than last year, and medium rice was also completed ahead of schedule. Daoxian County was therefore rated as the fastest rice transplanting county among the twelve counties in Hengyang Prefecture.

    Going Deep into Backward Areas

    The development of things is always uneven, with both advanced and backward areas. Xianzijiao Commune had been rated last in the county's production inspection and evaluation twice. Comrade Shi Xiuhua thought, "Why can't they catch up, there must be a reason?" So he decided to go there himself.

    Xianzijiao Commune is a large mountainous area, more than seventy li from the county seat. He traveled over mountains and ridges to reach the commune, and first came to Yanzhuping Brigade, the most backward brigade in the commune. He analyzed the reasons for the poor production with brigade leader He Yanzhong, and held discussions with commune members to understand the situation. Through various aspects of understanding, he found the reasons for the backward production, mainly that the Commune Party Committee had not properly arranged production based on the situation of more land and fewer laborers in the mountainous area, and according to local conditions. At that time, it was necessary to concentrate on agricultural production, but this commune still had 1,600 laborers digging coal for money; some production teams mainly grew coarse grains, but they were required to mainly grow rice, so the enthusiasm of the masses was not high.

    In the face of this situation, Secretary Shi personally helped the Commune Party Committee make arrangements: the coal mine was temporarily closed, and all the labor force was withdrawn; the agricultural labor force and the planting area of crops were re-arranged rationally, and specific plans were made for how to plant and manage each piece of land. These matters were all discussed with the masses. Under the encouragement of Secretary Shi and all the cadres taking the lead in participating in labor, a high tide of production was set off, and a competition was launched between teams and people. In less than a month, the production outlook of the commune was completely renewed, and spring sowing, summer harvesting, fertilizer accumulation, and crop cultivation and management were all carried out in a solid manner. When the county conducted the third large-scale production inspection and evaluation, Xianzijiao Commune rose from twelfth (last) place to fourth place.

    After Xianzijiao Commune jumped up, the previously advanced communes were encouraged to run forward with greater enthusiasm, and a lively competition movement was launched throughout the county.

    Vigorously Grasp Field Management

    The wind is still blowing, the rain is still falling, and the continuous rain has lasted for a month. The tips of some wild plants on the mountains have turned yellow due to the continuous rain. The rice seedlings, which are in the stage of growing strong stems, need sunny days so much, but the sky just doesn't clear up and the northeast wind is still blowing!

    The County Party Committee has held several meetings and believes that if we want to achieve a bumper harvest in the autumn, the key to current field management is to overcome the continuous rain. At this critical moment, Comrade Shi Xiuhua and other leaders of the County Party Committee mostly came to the fields to discuss with the masses the measures and methods to overcome the continuous rain.

    Under the guidance of Comrade Shi Xiuhua, the masses of Chetou Commune fired the first shot in overcoming the continuous rain and created a set of effective methods. They adopted multiple cultivation, heavy cultivation, and fine cultivation for the yellowed rice seedlings affected by the continuous rain to loosen the soil that had been compacted by the rain. At the same time, they supplemented pig and cow manure fertilizer in the fields with insufficient base fertilizer, and generally implemented ditch irrigation, frequent irrigation and drainage, so that cold raw water would not rush into the fields, preventing the loss of decomposed fertilizer. In response to the situation that rice pests were prone to occur on rainy days, a large amount of local pesticides were made and used for multiple encirclement and spraying. In this way, most of the yellowed rice seedlings in the commune quickly turned green. With this set of experiences, Comrade Shi Xiuhua and other comrades of the County Party Committee led the Party Committee Secretaries of all the communes in the county to visit and promote the experience of Chetou Commune in combination with the specific conditions of the local area. The confidence and enthusiasm of the cadres and the masses in overcoming the continuous rain and doing a good job in field management were even greater. Of the 400,000 mu of early and medium rice fields in the county, the original 28% were yellowed, but now it has dropped to about 10%. The masses are determined to eliminate all the remaining yellowed third-class seedlings within a few days in order to strive for a high yield in the autumn.

    县委书记石秀华
    本报记者　黄生谱　周荣
    天下着蒙蒙细雨，湖南道县月岩公社田垅中一个穿着灰布衣服的人，正细致地在察看禾苗生长情况。在给禾苗追施保温速效肥的社员们，老远就认出那是县委第一书记石秀华。走近时，社员何康臣亲热地呼唤：“石书记，你又来了！”“是的，又来参观你们的禾苗了。”石书记一边亲切地回答，一边用手拨弄着禾苗，细心地看。他发现苗秆还不够粗壮，又用手抓起一团泥来细看，显然基肥也快分解完了，难怪社员们在抗雨追肥！这天晚上，石书记邀请了这些社员一同研究进一步搞好生产的新措施，直到深夜才散会。
    知人情，熟地性
    石秀华同志从河北南下，来到道县工作将近十年了。每年他有四分之三的时间和群众在一起学习生产，实地指导工作。无论是炎热的暑天，还是风雪交加的寒冬腊月，他照样下乡。十年来他走遍了全县几十个村庄院落，熟悉了成千上万块田垅的土质、水利条件。群众中许多白发苍苍的老人和少年儿童都认识他，一见面就亲热地呼着“石书记”。离县城一百多里路外有个大山洞，里面住着十多户人，过去只是在山上种杂粮，外面的人很少进去过。可是石书记却走到了那里，帮他们订出了生产计划，并组织一队青年到山下去种稻子，增产了粮食。石秀华同志就是这样足迹踏遍了全县各地，掌握了许多情况。
    知人情，熟地性，对于指导和合理安排全县生产是多么重要啊！去年春耕中间，石秀华同志看到清溪公社有一片地种稻谷产量很低，便和社员研究试种花生。他们种花生四百亩，居然增产了，平均亩产八百斤，比种稻子增加两三倍收入。今年，这里就把花生扩大为六百五十亩。社员李祖德说：“石书记替群众办的好事，一年比一年多。”
    寻找“千里马”
    在每个生产环节中，石秀华同志都注意深入群众，发掘先进经验，寻找先进人物。人们称他这种活动为寻找“千里马”。
    今年，他在乡下参加插秧，看到每人每天平均只能插一分多田，工效很低。但是，今年普遍推行了3×5寸和3×6寸的密植规格，按现在这个插秧进度一算，全县起码要延误一个季节才能如数如质插完秧。他心里很急，群众心里也很急。
    “找‘千里马’去”！于是他到群众中去访贤问能。当他发现车头公社十八岁的女共产党员沈喜莲一天能插五万二千兜秧时，高兴极了，连忙带领十一个公社党委书记和有关农业技术干部，来到车头公社，请沈喜莲介绍经验，作现场表演。他和公社党委书记们用心地观看出沈喜莲拿秧束的左手靠近水面，拇指、食指和中指灵活地分着秧，右手只管往田里插，像鸡啄米般地快。由右插到左，从左又插到右，不甩头，省往返时间。同时，喜莲的脚斜踩入泥，退插时就不需再用手去扶平脚眼。插秧高工效经验就这样，被总结出来。广泛传授了沈喜莲的经验，训练了五万零八百名插秧能手。因此全县每人每天插秧进度由原来的一分多田提到五分田以上，其中每天能插一亩田的有四千人。结果早稻比去年提前二十多天插完了，中稻也提前完成。道县还因此被评为衡阳地区十二个县插秧最快的。
    深入落后地区
    事物发展总是不平衡的，有先进，有后进。仙子脚公社在全县生产大检查大评比中，曾经两次被评为末名。石秀华同志想，“为什么总赶不上去，其中定有原因”？便决定亲自到那里去。
    仙子脚公社是个大山区，从县城去有七十多华里，他翻山越岭赶到公社，首先就来到了这个公社最落后的烟竹坪大队。他和大队长何衍忠分析生产没搞好的原因，又同社员座谈摸情况。通过多方面了解，找出了生产落后的原因，主要是公社党委没有根据山区地多劳少的情况，因人因地制宜地妥善安排生产。当时正需要全力搞农业生产，但这个社却还有一千六百个劳力在挖煤赚钱用；有些生产队是以种杂粮为主的，却要他们以种稻谷为主，因此群众积极性不够高。
    面对这一情况，石书记亲自帮助公社党委作好安排：煤矿暂时停开，抽回了全部劳力；从新合理地安排了农业上的劳力和作物播种面积，并具体规划到每一块田地如何种植，如何管理。这些事都一一同群众商讨好。在石书记和全体干部带头参加劳动的鼓舞下，掀起了生产高潮，队与队、人与人之间展开了评比竞赛。不到一个月，公社的生产面貌焕然一新，春播、夏收、积肥、作物培育管理，项项工夫都搞得扎扎实实。第三次全县进行生产大检查大评比的时候，仙子脚公社就由原来的十二（最末）名升到第四名了。
    当仙子脚公社跃升上来后，原来生产先进的公社鼓起了更大的干劲向前跑，你追我赶的竞赛运动，轰轰烈烈在全县展开了。
    狠抓田间管理
    眼前风还在吹，雨还在下，阴雨连绵已经持续了一个月，山上有些野生植物的叶尖，都被这阴雨沤得发黄了。正处在长苗壮秆的禾苗，是多么需要晴天，而天却偏偏不放晴，还刮着东北风！
    县委几次召开会议，认为要想获得秋后丰产，当前田间管理的关键是战胜阴雨。在这紧要关头，石秀华同志和县委其他领导人，大都来到了田垅，和群众研究战胜阴雨的措施和办法。
    在石秀华同志的指导下，车头公社的群众，打响了战胜阴雨的第一炮，创造了一套有效办法。他们在受阴雨影响发黄的禾苗里，分别情况，采取多中耕、重中耕、细中耕，以疏松被雨打紧了的泥土。同时在底肥不足的田里，追补猪、牛粪肥，普遍实行沟圳排灌，勤灌勤排，使冷生水不致冲入田里，防止分解了的肥料流失。针对阴雨天稻害虫容易发生的情况，自制了大量土农药，进行了多次围剿喷杀。这样，全社大部分发黄的禾苗迅速转青。有了这套经验，石秀华同志和县委其他同志便带领全县各公社党委书记前去参观，把车头公社的经验结合本地的具体情况进行推广，干部和群众战胜阴雨、搞好田间管理的信心更大了，干劲更足了。全县四十万亩早、中稻田，原有28％发黄，现在下降到10％左右了。群众决心要在几天内，把这余下发黄的三类苗全部消灭，以争取秋后高产。
