　　Accumulating little makes a mink coat; many grains of sand make a pagoda. Our predecessors understood this principle long ago. Now, many places are advocating the use of spare time and scattered plots of land, making the most of space along roadsides, at the corners of fields, in front of and behind houses, striving to plant as much as possible. This is very beneficial: planting more coarse grains, melons, vegetables, and oil crops allows people to eat them and also use them to raise livestock and poultry. It can increase the income of both the commune and its members, and also help improve the lives of the members. The directly-managed production team of the Maqiao Commune in Shanghai County planted scattered plots of land totaling 153 mu, increasing the average income per household by 32.3 yuan, which is a considerable income for farming families.

　　Some people think that scattered plots of land are insignificant. Seen in isolation, some of these plots are so small that "you can't turn a hoe," and it's easy not to notice them. But little things add up, and added together, they become quite substantial. The crops planted by the Dawei People's Commune in Dangtu County, Anhui Province, on scattered plots of land in front of and behind villages last autumn have now joyfully yielded a bumper harvest, with an expected total harvest of 2.2 million jin of grain. The people of Anhui Province, responding to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, have already utilized more than 4 million mu of vacant and wasteland while concentrating their main efforts on the summer harvest and planting. Can this be considered a small number? If all parts of the country do this, how much grain, melons, vegetables, and oil crops can be increased! The number of pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, etc., that can be raised is also unimaginable.

　　There are two ways to plant scattered plots of land: one is collective planting by production teams and production brigades, and the other is private planting by commune members. Both should be promoted simultaneously. Some people have concerns about encouraging commune members to plant some scattered plots of land in front of and behind their houses: first, they fear it will affect collective work attendance; second, they fear it will scatter the limited fertilizer, and so on. These concerns are unnecessary.

　　Here, there is indeed a contradiction between the collective and the individual. However, this contradiction cannot be "eliminated" in a simple way at any time. Proper arrangements, allowing commune members to plant some scattered plots of land, are conducive to production development and also help to resolve the contradiction between the collective and the individual. In situations where the collective management of production cannot yet fully meet the various needs of commune members' lives, allowing commune members to use spare time to plant some scattered plots of land is very beneficial to adjusting the relationship between the collective and the individual. Commune members only use their spare time and auxiliary labor to manage some scattered plots of land in front of and behind their houses, so the amount is naturally not very large. As long as ideological education is done well, and the principle of distribution according to work is earnestly implemented in collective production, and the system of production responsibility and basic workdays is established and improved, commune members will not disregard collective interests because they have planted some scattered plots of land. If some of the living needs of commune members are met by planting some scattered plots of land themselves, the commune and the team can also reduce some of the burden. Commune members naturally have to use some fertilizer to plant scattered plots of land; on the surface, it seems that less fertilizer is used for the large fields. In fact, if the crops on the scattered plots of land grow well, there will be more feed for raising pigs, and the source of fertilizer for the entire commune will be broader. In short, the accounts must be calculated from a broad perspective, not just from a narrow one. Commune members always have spare time, and it is impossible to put all the spare time into collective production. In particular, some auxiliary labor cannot be frequently put into collective production. Giving commune members some flexibility in time, allowing them to manage some scattered plots of land (if they are not managed, these lands will be wasted) and household sideline occupations, not only makes it convenient for commune members, but more importantly, it is conducive to the development of production and the increase of wealth for the entire society. Commune members receive more income due to the care of the commune, feel more comfortable, and work harder, which is even more conducive to the consolidation of the commune. The contradiction between the individual and the collective is an objective reality. A good head of the household does not ignore these contradictions, but actively grasps and appropriately resolves them.

　　It is currently the summer planting season. On the premise of ensuring the completion of the prescribed summer planting plan, each production team and production brigade should mobilize commune members to make full use of scattered plots of land. Organs, schools, and factories with conditions can also use vacant land. Plant grain and oil crops if you can plant grain and oil crops, and plant melons, fruits, and vegetables if you can plant melons, fruits, and vegetables. You reap what you sow. As long as you manage carefully, you will surely get a great harvest!

    零和整、个人和集体
    苏宜
    集腋成裘，聚沙成塔，前人早懂得这个道理。现在，许多地方都在提倡用零零星星的时间，种零零星星的土地，路边、地角、家前、屋后，见缝插针，力争多种。这样做大有好处：多种了杂粮、瓜菜、油料作物等，人既可以吃，又可以饲养家畜、家禽；既可以增加公社和社员的收入，也有助于改善社员的生活。上海县马桥公社直属生产队种零星土地，共计一百五十三亩，平均每户可增加收入三十二元三角，这对农家来说是一笔很可观的收入。
    有人以为零零星星土地没有什么了不起。孤立起来看，这些地有的小得“转不开锄头”，很容易看不到眼里。但是积少成多，加起来就很可观。安徽省当涂县大圩人民公社去秋在村前屋后零星土地上种的作物，现在已喜庆丰收，预计共可收粮食二百二十万斤。安徽全省人民响应省委号召，在集中主要力量突击夏收夏种的同时，已利用了空隙荒地四百多万亩。这能算是很小的数目吗？如果全国各地都这样做，能增产多少粮食、瓜菜、油料！可以多喂的猪、鸡、鸭、鹅等，更可想而知了。
    种零星土地有两种办法，一是由生产队、生产小队集体种，一是由社员私人种。二者应该同时并举。有人对于提倡社员在家前屋后种一些零星土地有些顾虑：一怕影响集体出工，二怕分散有限的肥料，等等。这些顾虑都是不必要的。
    在这里，确实有集体和个人的矛盾。但是，任何时候都不能用一种简单的方式“取消”这种矛盾。安排得当，让社员种些零星地，才有利于生产发展，也有助于解决集体和个人的矛盾。在集体经营的生产还不能多方面地满足社员生活上的各种需要的情况下，让社员利用零星时间种些零星地，对于调整集体和个人的关系大有好处。社员只是利用工余时间和辅助劳力来经营一些家前屋后的零星土地，这数目自然不会很大。只要做好思想教育工作，在集体生产中切实执行按劳分配的原则，建立和健全生产责任制和基本劳动日制，社员是不会因为种了一些零星地就不看重集体利益的。社员的部分生活需要由自己种一部分零星地来解决了，社、队也可以减少一部分负担。社员种零星地自然要用一些肥料；表面上看来，似乎大田少用了这一部分肥料。其实，零星地的作物生长好了，养猪有了更多的饲料，整个公社的肥源也就会更加宽广。总之，账要从大处算，不能光从小处算。社员零零星星的时间总是有的，要把零星时间全部都投入集体生产是不可能的。特别是有些辅助劳动力，不能经常投入集体生产。在时间上给社员一些机动余地，让他经营一些零星土地（如果不经营，这些土地也是白白荒废）和家庭副业，不仅方便了社员，更重要的是有利于整个社会的生产的发展和财富的增加。社员由于公社的照顾而得到更多收入，心情更加舒畅，干活更加有劲，这也更加有利于公社的巩固。个人和集体的矛盾是客观存在，好的当家人不是抹煞这些矛盾，而是主动地掌握和适当解决这些矛盾。
    目前正是夏种季节。各个生产队，生产小队在保证完成规定的夏种计划的前提下，要发动社员尽量利用零星土地。有条件的机关、学校、工厂也可以利用空闲地。能种粮食和油料作物就种粮食和油料作物，能种瓜果蔬菜就种瓜果蔬菜。种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。只要精心管理，一定会得到很大的收获！
