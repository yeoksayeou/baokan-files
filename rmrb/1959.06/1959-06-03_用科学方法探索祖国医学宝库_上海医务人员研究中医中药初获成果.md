Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 2nd: Medical personnel in Shanghai, from municipal-level medical research institutions and large hospitals to grassroots medical units, are actively studying and researching traditional Chinese medicine.

Acupuncture is the most widely used traditional Chinese medicine therapy in clinical practice in Shanghai's medical circles. Medical units are constantly developing it in application and simultaneously carrying out research on the physiological and pathological mechanisms of acupuncture. Shanghai First People's Hospital has focused on studying ear acupuncture, a simpler and faster-acting acupuncture method, which is a pain-relieving therapy passed down from ancient times in China. So far, from more than a thousand cases treated with ear acupuncture, it has been found that in addition to producing analgesic effects, it has anti-inflammatory effects on mastitis, tonsillitis, etc., and also has a hypotensive effect on those with neurasthenia and high intracranial pressure. At the same time, they found that ear acupuncture treatment increased gastric motility and gastric juice secretion in patients. Based on clinical experience, the Shanghai First People's Hospital has preliminarily confirmed the effective areas of acupuncture for treating diseases of various organs throughout the body.

Medical units are actively seeking the rationale behind acupuncture treatment from clinical observation, animal experiments, and instrumental observation. The College of Traditional Chinese Medicine used electrocardiograms to observe that acupuncture at different acupoints can slow down or speed up the heartbeat in more than eighty cases of hypertension, deafness, and muteness treated with acupuncture. In ninety normal human trials, the First Medical College observed that the number of eosinophils and hemoglobin in the blood increased after acupuncture at certain acupoints.

The exploration of meridian theory has deeply attracted medical professionals in Shanghai. The Municipal Health Bureau and some hospitals have held discussions separately. Many people have affirmed that meridians objectively exist, and at the same time believe that meridian theory is a major part of the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and is a principle that all traditional Chinese medicine therapies and pharmacology must follow.

In order to accelerate the research on meridian theory, the Municipal Health Bureau strengthened the organizational leadership of inter-hospital cooperation throughout the city, and established research groups such as the acupuncture treatment of appendicitis physiological mechanism research group, the meridian instrument group, and the meridian and internal organ relationship research group, starting from the physiological mechanism of acupuncture, Qigong, and traditional Chinese medicine. At present, the study of the physiological mechanism of acupuncture treatment of appendicitis has made some new discoveries: in animal experiments, it was observed in rabbits that intestinal peristalsis increased after acupuncture; in biochemical research, it was found that after acupuncture, the endocrine and immune factors such as adrenocortical function and white blood cell phagocytosis ability were enhanced. In animal experiments, it is planned to cut off the animal's nerves, muscles, etc., and then puncture acupoints to observe the relationship between meridians and the nervous system. In other aspects, several topics have also been initially summarized. The First Medical College found that the meridians and nerve distribution are inconsistent from the determination of the range of acupuncture analgesia, and initially negated the statement that meridians are nerves. Regarding the relationship between meridians and nerves, they found from experiments on general anesthesia and observation of meridian phenomenon changes that the changes in meridian phenomena are not only related to the autonomic nervous system, but also to the central nervous system.

Many hospitals are constantly improving the structure of meridian measuring instruments. The Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with the First Medical College has successively manufactured six types of eighteen resistance measuring instruments in order to improve the shortcomings of large instrument errors, and has used this instrument to measure the resistance of acupoints under different physiological states, and found that the resistance of acupoints is closely related to the physiological state of the human body. Now they have also trial-produced a potential-type meridian measuring instrument, which is conducive to studying the physiological changes in various parts of the body and has very small errors.

At present, many medical units are summarizing the experience and laws of traditional Chinese medicine in treating difficult diseases such as hypertension, tumors, and chronic nephritis. Many hospitals have studied the efficacy of Clerodendrum trichotomum and Erxian Decoction in treating hypertension. The pharmacology group of the Municipal Hypertension Research Institute has extracted several kinds of effective components of traditional Chinese medicine to lower blood pressure and used them extensively in clinical practice. According to clinical experience, the Hypertension Research Institute has affirmed the special antihypertensive effect of Qigong. At the same time, combining Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity, they studied the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and believed that the so-called "intention" and "Qi" of Qigong can be explained by the theory of the correlation between the cerebral cortex and the internal organs in Pavlov's theory. They also combined the theories of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, adopted the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine syndrome differentiation and treatment combined with the scientific examination methods of Western medicine, and carried out the classification of hypertension by traditional Chinese and Western medicine.

    用科学方法探索祖国医学宝库
    上海医务人员研究中医中药初获成果
    据新华社上海2日电　上海市从市级医学研究机构、大型医院到基层医疗单位的医务人员们，都在积极地学习、研究中医中药。
    针灸是上海市医务界在临床上运用最广的中医疗法，各医疗单位在运用中不断地有所发展，同时展开了针灸的生理、病理机制作用的研究。上海第一人民医院着重研究了针灸中较简易而且收效较快的耳针，这是我国民间从古代流传下来的止痛疗法。到目前为止，从一千多受到耳针治疗的病例中，发现除产生止痛效果外，对乳腺炎、扁桃腺炎等有消炎作用，对神经衰弱而脑压较高者，还有降压作用。同时，他们发现病人受到耳针治疗后胃蠕动增加、胃液增多。上海第一人民医院根据临床经验，已将治疗全身各脏器病症的针灸有效区域初步肯定下来。
    各医疗单位从临床观察、动物试验、仪器观察等方面，积极寻找针灸治病的道理。中医学院从针刺治疗高血压、聋哑等八十多病例中，利用心电图观察出针刺不同的穴位可以使心跳变慢或加快。第一医学院在九十例正常人体试验中，观察发现针刺某些穴位后，血液中嗜伊红细胞和血红蛋白增加。
    对经络学说的探讨，深深地吸引了上海的医务界人士。市卫生局和一些医院都分别召集讨论会，不少人都肯定经络是客观存在的，同时认为经络学说是祖国医学理论中的一个主要部分，是一切中医疗法和药理都要遵循的原理。
    为加速对经络学说的研究，市卫生局加强了全市各医院互相协作的组织领导工作，成立了针灸治阑尾炎生理机制研究小组、经络仪小组以及经络与内脏关系研究小组等，从针灸、气功及中医中药的生理机制作用方面着手研究。目前，针灸治疗阑尾炎生理机制研究已有一些新发现：在动物实验中，从兔子身上观察到，针刺后肠子蠕动增加；在生物化学的研究中，发现针刺后，肾上腺皮质功能和白血球吞噬能力等内分泌与免疫因素增强。动物实验中，拟在割断动物神经、肌肉等后，针刺穴位，观察经络与神经系统的关系。在其他方面，有若干题目也已经作出初步总结。第一医学院从针刺止痛范围的测定中，发现经络与神经分布不一致，初步否定了经络即是神经的说法，在经络与神经的关系上，他们从全身麻醉、观察经络现象变化的试验中，发现经络现象的变化不仅和植物性神经系统有一定关系，而且和中枢神经系统也有一定的关系。
    不少医院不断改进经络测定仪器的构造。第一医学院附属中山医院，为改进仪器误差大的缺点，曾先后制造了六种十八型电阻式测定仪器，并且用这种仪器测定了不同生理状态下的穴道电阻，发现穴道电阻与人体生理状态有密切关系。现在他们又试制成电位式的经络测定仪，有利于研究全身各部生理的变化，并且差误很小。
    目前，不少医疗单位正在总结中医中药治疗高血压、肿瘤、慢性肾炎等难治疾病的经验和规律。不少医院研究了臭梧桐、二仙汤等治高血压的疗效。市高血压研究所药理组已提炼出若干种中药降低血压的有效成分，并大量用于临床。高血压研究所根据临床经验，肯定了气功的降压特效，同时结合巴甫洛夫高级神经活动理论研究了中医理论，认为气功所谓的“意”和“气”，可以用巴甫洛夫学说中的大脑皮层与内脏相关的理论来阐明。他们还结合中西医的理论，采取了中医辨证论治的优点结合西医科学检查的方法，进行了高血压病的中西医的分类工作。
