Talking about "Trouble"
Zong Chuan

    In the midst of the enthusiastic upsurge of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the saying "trouble" is often heard. Some say that comprehensive utilization of raw materials is a good thing, but it is too "troublesome"; some say that using waste materials and substitutes is indeed a way to save raw materials, but it is too "troublesome," and if not done properly, it will produce defective products. Such things need not be detailed.

    To say "trouble" is everywhere, arising at any time. It will never leave because you hate it, retreat because you fear it, or forgive you because you avoid it. There are no absolutely identical things in the world. Since things are different, you should never use only one old method to deal with them. Even though both are revolutionary wars, guerrilla warfare is different from mobile warfare and positional warfare; even though both are economic construction, industry is different from agriculture and transportation... Since there are differences, different methods must be used to solve them. How can we solve problems if we are afraid of "trouble"? Even for the same job, due to the passage of time and changes in the environment, it will bring many new characteristics at any time and anywhere, and these many new characteristics will inevitably bring many new "troubles" to people. For example, if comrades who live in the evergreen south go to cultivate the Great Northern Wilderness, where there are months of ice and snow in a year, they must understand the climate characteristics, soil conditions, and plant habits there, find a suitable planting season, study scientific cultivation methods, and explore a set of reasonable management methods. Otherwise, don't even think about getting a good harvest.

    Hearing this, those comrades who dislike "trouble" may not be able to stand it. They say, "Isn't this too 'troublesome'? I'd better go back to my hometown to farm. Anyway, it's all farming, why come here to find this kind of 'trouble'?" Fine, if you think that's easier, then go back. However, although there is no such "trouble" in your hometown, there are quite a few new problems. For example, in the past, after you put the seeds in the ground, you just waited for God to send rain. Of course, this method is much simpler, but today we are different. We want to implement a network of rivers and canals to divert water to irrigate fields... And this cannot but trouble you to think of some new methods—you have to measure the terrain to see where it is appropriate to let the water flow from. And in the future, you will have to study how to use agricultural machinery under such conditions. All kinds of problems come one after another, see how you can escape! The problem is very clear: every step forward will inevitably encounter many "troubles." If you don't want "trouble," you have to stop moving forward.

    Perhaps some people will say: I don't believe it. For example, when we make coke, can't we still do the same as in the past, only producing coke and nothing else, without extracting this oil or that oil, wouldn't that save several layers of "trouble"? Doing so does save a lot of "trouble," but it also throws away "this oil and that oil" for nothing. And when you use "this oil and that oil" but don't have it, you save a small "trouble" in the front, and a big "trouble" follows in the back. Do you think it's "trouble" or not at this time!

### 谈“麻烦”

    谈“麻烦”
    宗川
    正在增产节约运动热烈展开的时候，“麻烦”之说不时传来耳边。有的说，原材料综合利用是件好事，就是太“麻烦”了；有的说，利用废料、代用品确实是节约原材料的门道，可是太“麻烦”了，而且，一弄不好，就出废品。如此种种，不必细说。
    要说“麻烦”，真可算是遍地皆是，随时而生，绝不会因为你讨厌而远离，因为你害怕而自退，因为你逃避而宽赦。世界上没有绝对相同的事物，既然事物各不相同，因而你就绝不应该只用一种老办法去对待它。同样都是革命战争，游击战不同于运动战和阵地战；同样都是经济建设，工业又不同于农业、交通运输业……。既有不同，就得采用不同办法去解决。要怕“麻烦”，怎能解决？即使是同一件工作吧，由于时间的推移，环境的变化，随时随地都会给它带来许多新的特点，而这许多新特点就必然给人们带来许多新的“麻烦”。比方，同样是种地，住在四季常青的南方的同志，如果远到一年之中就有数月是冰天雪地的北大荒去开垦，那你就必得摸清那里的气候特点，土壤情况，植物习性，找出适宜种植的季节；研究出科学的栽培方法；摸索出一套合理的管理办法。否则，你就别想获得丰收。
    这样一说，那些嫌“麻烦”的同志恐怕又受不了。说：“这不太
  ‘麻烦’吗，我还是回到我们老家去种吧，反正都是种地，何必上这来找这种‘麻烦’呢？”也罢，如果你认为那样省事的话，那你就回去吧，不过，在你的老家虽然没有了这样的“麻烦”，可是新问题也相当多。比方说，过去，你把种子下到地里以后，光等着老天爷下雨就行了，当然，这种办法简单的多，可是我们今天不同了，我们要实行河网化，开河引水浇田，……而这就不能不麻烦你想些新的办法——你得测量一下地形，看看让水从哪里向哪里流合适。而在将来，你还得研究在这样的条件下怎样使用农业机械。种种问题，接踵而来，看你如何逃避法！问题很清楚：每要前进一步，必然遇到许多“麻烦”，要想不“麻烦”，除非止步不前。
    也许有人会这样说：我就不相信，比方炼焦炭吧，我们不会仍和过去一样，只炼出焦炭来就完事，不再另外炼取什么这种油那种油的，不就省却了几层“麻烦”吗？这样办，“麻烦”确是省去了不少，但也把“这种油那种油”白白丢掉了。而当你用着“这种油那种油”的时候却又没有，前边省了个小“麻烦”，后边跟来个大“麻烦”，你看这时候“麻烦”不“麻烦”呢！
