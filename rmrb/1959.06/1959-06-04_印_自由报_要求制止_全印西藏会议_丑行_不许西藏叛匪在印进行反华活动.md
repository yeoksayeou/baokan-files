Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 3rd: The Indian Bengali-language newspaper "Liberty" published an editorial on June 1st, demanding that strong action be taken to stop things like what happened at the recent so-called "All-India Tibet Conference" in Calcutta, namely the distribution of anti-China leaflets and the participation of a Tibetan, said to be an aide of the Dalai Lama, in that conference.

The editorial, entitled "Where Did They Get Such Audacity?", stated that India had pledged and guaranteed that the Dalai Lama or his entourage would not engage in any anti-China activities on Indian soil. The editorial said, "But how could a member of the Dalai Lama's entourage, Sonam Gyatso, participate in the so-called 'Tibetan Conference' and speak at it? Not only that, but it has been seen that the fleeing Tibetan reactionaries have already organized an army on Indian soil and are even openly distributing illegal leaflets."

On May 30th, a "communique" from the Tibetan rebel organization "National Volunteer Defense Army" was distributed at the so-called "All-India Tibet Conference." According to a report in "Liberty" on May 31st, this organization has a branch in Kalimpong.

    印“自由报”要求制止“全印西藏会议”丑行
    不许西藏叛匪在印进行反华活动
    新华社新德里3日电　印度孟加拉文“自由报”1日发表社论，要求采取有力的行动来制止最近在加尔各答举行的所谓“全印西藏会议”上发生的那样的事情，即：散发反华传单和一个据说是达赖喇嘛随员的西藏人参加那次会议。
    这篇题为“那里来的这样大的胆子？”的社论说，印度曾经担保和保证，达赖喇嘛或他的随员不会在印度的土地上进行任何反对中国的活动。社论说，“可是，达赖喇嘛的一个随员索南嘉措怎么会参加所谓‘西藏会议’，并且在会上发了言呢？不仅如此，人们还看到，逃亡的西藏反动派已经在印度的土地上组织了军队，而且还在公开散发非法的传单。”
    5月30日，在所谓“全印西藏会议”上散发了一份西藏叛乱分子的组织“民族志愿保卫军”的“公报”。据“自由报”31日报道，这个组织在噶伦堡设有分支机构。
