From Waterlogged Depression to Wheat Wave
    --A Record of the Wheat Harvest Scene in Yongcheng County, Henan
    Jing Can, Ting Xiu, Xu Liang, Jun Qing

    Yongcheng, a region with low-lying terrain and perennial disasters, under the brilliant leadership of the Party, has achieved a major victory in the socialist construction of the motherland and in the struggle to overcome natural disasters by giving full play to the revolutionary traditions of its 750,000 people. This year, the entire county has achieved a bumper wheat harvest.

    Everywhere in the county are crowds of people rushing to harvest and plant. The unharvested wheat is golden, and the cut wheat covers the ground. Big carts are constantly pulling towards the villages and threshing grounds.

    Water Wave Transforms into Wheat Wave

    "Millennial water wave transforms into wheat wave, lakes and depressions become flour jars, eating in our mouths, thinking in our hearts, happiness all depends on the Communist Party." This is the song of the members of the Houling Commune about this year's bumper wheat harvest.

    Houling Commune is a well-known "Five Lakes, Four Depressions, Six Great Wastelands" in the county. 84% of the total cultivated land in the commune is lake and depression land. When there is a suitable rain in other places, it is a vast ocean here; if it does not rain for a few days, the land cracks open and drought is everywhere. The masses say: heavy rain brings big disaster, light rain brings small disaster, no rain brings drought disaster, and nine out of ten years are disastrous. In the years since liberation, the state has supplied large quantities of grain every year, and has also provided loans for relief; the road of organizing has guided people to get rid of many difficulties, but the ability to overcome natural disasters is insufficient, and the living standards of the commune members are still relatively low. The 50,000 farmers living here are looking forward to moving the big disaster mountain pressing on their heads day and night. In the past few years, the Party and the government have led the masses to dig some ditches, pits, and ponds, which have reduced certain floods, but have not eradicated drought and flood disasters.

    In the spring of 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, after learning from the experience of river network systems in other places, the county party committee decided to vigorously develop river network systems in these Five Lakes, Four Depressions, and Six Great Wastelands. The county mobilized 20,000 water conservancy troops, led by the first secretary of the county party committee, and fought for two months, digging and renovating fourteen ditches and rivers, building new ponds and repairing old ponds two hundred and ninety-six, and enclosing fields and terrace fields more than 70,000 mu, basically realizing the river network system. From then on, general rainwater is intercepted and stored by ditches and ponds, and can be irrigated during droughts; special rain and floods are discharged down the ditches, avoiding flood disasters. Last autumn, there were several days of heavy rain, with rainfall reaching more than 500 millimeters, but the autumn harvest in the lakes and depressions was still preserved. The lakes and depressions were free of water accumulation, and even 21,000 mu of lake bottom land, which could not be planted with wheat in previous years, was planted in time; the wheat planting area expanded from 81,000 mu (accounting for 50% of the total cultivated land area) to 100,8963 mu, accounting for 68% of the total cultivated land area. In the management of wheat, water was irrigated twice, an unprecedented event, management was strengthened, and fertilizer was applied, making the wheat grow unprecedentedly well. In previous years, a yield of 50 or 60 jin per mu was good, and the yield per mu was only 80 jin in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, while this year, each team increased production by tens of percent or even more than doubled.

    Idle Land is Not Idle

    Using idle land, especially under the trees in villages, people always thought that they could only grow vegetables such as pumpkins and peppers with extremely strong growth ability, and did not believe that food crops could also be grown. But in every village of the Shuangqiao Commune, you can see that in the peach tree forest on the edge of the village, the wheat beards are supporting the branches; in the empty garden in the village, the wheat is neatly standing, reaching up to the chest; on the banks of the pits and ponds, along the winding ditches, the wheat is golden. Vegetables and melon seedlings are planted in front of and behind the houses. In this way, the whole commune expanded the planting area by about 19,100 mu, of which wheat accounted for 6,890 mu.

    When planting wheat last year, the commune party committee accepted the Yanshi experience and launched a mass movement to march into abandoned land. When the wheat turned green this year, another mass discussion on cherishing the fruits of labor was launched throughout the commune, calling on everyone to manage the wheat seedlings in the large fields, and also to manage the wheat seedlings in the abandoned land. Each village also organized children to protect the green, preventing pigs, sheep, chickens and ducks from trampling on it. Since then, in every link of wheat field management, when comparing visits and holding battlefield meetings, the growth of crops in abandoned land has also been included as a content. Aiming at the characteristics of abandoned land being scattered, nearby, and belonging to individual commune members, slogans such as "grab cloudy days, grab morning and evening, grab before and after meals" were put forward to allow commune members to use these gaps to manage the crops in abandoned land. Zhang Yuncai, an old man in Guanzhuang Village, said with emotion: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are really thinking about everyone everywhere!"

    Actively Accumulating Fertilizer from Spring to Winter

    In the villages in the Maqiao, Peiqiao, and Xiaqiao areas, there are clean toilets and pig pens next to the courtyards and roads; black and smelly silt is also accumulated next to the pits and ponds. It is common for rural areas to have toilets, pig pens, and manure piles, but here it is a major reform. This is also one of the important reasons for this year's bumper wheat harvest.

    Originally, in this area, the land was vast and the population was sparse, with an average of more than ten mu of land per person. The soil was poor, and after a heavy rain today, the sky cleared tomorrow, and the land would become hardened and difficult to cultivate. Over the years, people could only plant extensively and harvest little. Most of the land was not fertilized, and even if a small part of the land was fertilized, it was very little. People here did not have the habit of accumulating fertilizer. Until last year, some households still had "no toilets for people and no pens for pigs."

    During the Great Leap Forward last year, party committees at all levels in the county regarded the construction of toilets, the construction of pig pens, and the accumulation and application of fertilizer as the fundamental measures to increase agricultural production and as a social reform to change customs and habits. Therefore, party members, league members, and activists led the masses, from the spring when peach blossoms were red and willows were green to the severe winter when grass was withered and water was cold. In nearly a year, 7,820 new toilets and 915 pig pens were built, and the pit and pond mud that had not been dug for generations was also dug out. After communization, people had greater strength and sent all the fertilizer to the fields, basically eliminating the "斋公田" [land not given fertilizer]. Once the silt land saw manure, the crops grew exceptionally well. The more than 40 mu of wheat that Li Zhai production team has already harvested has increased by 60% compared with last year. Commune member Li Baoyan said happily to the cadres, holding the fat wheat: "The land that has not been fertilized for generations grows really fiercely when fertilized. This year's production is a Great Leap Forward because last year's fertilizer accumulation was a Great Leap Forward!"

    Eating the State's Grain in the Past, Handing Over Grain First This Year

    "We don't want the state to supply grain anymore. We guarantee to save grain and overfulfill the summer grain purchase task." When talking about the bumper wheat harvest, from commune members to cadres, they all said this in unison. These words have profound meaning. Only those who eat the state's grain understand how much pleasure there is here, and how much glory and pride there is.

    In the wheat field of the Dongguan Production Team of the Chengguan Commune, the old man Zhuang Yongzhi was driving the livestock and singing a allegro that he composed: "Bean-sized wheat smells fragrant for thousands of miles, high wheat stacks are piled up beside the field, take advantage of the weather and the wind to quickly thresh and dry, dry and winnow cleanly and hand over public grain and sell surplus grain. ..." The old man Zhang Guitian said: "In the past, we ate the state's grain. This year, we have a bumper harvest. We must first hand over public grain, sell surplus grain, and also hand over the best."

    The wheat of the Chengcun Brigade of the Chengcun Commune has been harvested, and the commune members threshed, dried, and put it into the warehouse as they went. On June 8, 35,000 jin had already been put into the warehouse, and they planned to overfulfill the purchase task within three days. After a rough calculation based on the current estimate of production of this team's wheat, after completing the purchase task and deducting seeds, rations, and feed, there is still reserve grain. In addition to paying wages and appropriately improving the lives of commune members, the money from selling grain is also planned to be used to buy livestock, carts, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, and to strive for a greater autumn harvest.

    洼地水浪变麦浪
    ——记河南永城县小麦丰收景象
    敬参　庭秀　须良　俊卿
    永城，这个地势低洼连年遭灾的地区，在祖国社会主义建设中，在党的英明领导下，七十五万人民发扬革命传统，在战胜自然灾害的斗争中，又取得了重大胜利，今年小麦获得了全县范围的大丰收。
    全县到处是抢收抢种的人群，未割的麦子一片金黄，已割的麦铺满地，大车不住地拉向村里、场上。
    水浪变麦浪
    “千年水浪变麦浪，湖洼变成白面缸，嘴里吃着心中想，幸福全靠共产党。”这是侯岭公社社员们对今年小麦大丰收的歌唱。
    侯岭公社是全县有名的“五湖四洼六大荒”。全社总耕地的84％是湖洼地。外地下一场适墒雨，这里便是一片汪洋；几天不下雨，就土地张嘴、旱象满目。群众说：大雨大灾，小雨小灾，无雨旱灾，十年就有九年灾。解放几年来，年年国家供应大批粮食，还要贷款救济；组织起来的道路，引导人们摆脱了许多困难，但对战胜自然灾害的能力不足，社员生活水平还是比较低。住在这里的五万农民日夜盼望着能搬倒压在头上的这座大灾山。几年来党和政府领导群众也开挖了一些沟渠、坑塘，减少了一定的水灾，但还没有根除旱涝灾害。
    在大跃进的1958年春，学习了外地河网化的经验，县委决定在这五湖四洼六大荒里，大搞河网化。全县出动二万名水利大军，由县委第一书记挂帅，奋战了两个月，开挖和整修沟河十四条，打新塘和修旧塘二百九十六个，以及围田、台田七万多亩，基本上实现了河网化。从此，一般雨水沟塘拦蓄，旱了能浇；特大雨水、洪水顺沟泄下，免除了涝灾。去年秋季，一连几天大雨，下雨量达五百多公厘，仍然保住了湖洼里秋季大丰收。湖洼没有了积水，连往年不能种麦的二万一千亩湖底地也及时种上了；麦播面积由八万一千亩（占总耕地面积的50％），扩大到十万零八千九百六十三亩，占总耕地面积的68％。在小麦管理中，前所未有地浇了二次水，加强了管理，上了肥，使小麦长的空前好。在往年，亩产五十斤、六十斤就不错了，大跃进的1958年亩产才八十斤，而今年队队增产百分之几十甚至一倍以上。
    空闲地不空闲
    利用空闲地，尤其是村庄内树林下，人们总认为只能种些生长力极强的南瓜、辣椒之类的蔬菜，不相信也能种粮食作物。但在双乔公社的每个村庄里，你可以看到村边桃树林里，小麦的胡子顶住了树杈；村里那个空园里，齐呼呼的麦子，高达胸上；坑塘岸上，曲曲弯弯的沟边，麦子一片金黄。宅前、宅后全种上了蔬菜瓜苗。就这样，全公社扩大种植面积约一万九千一百亩，其中麦子占六千八百九十亩。
    去年种麦时，公社党委接受偃师经验，开展了一个向废弃地进军的群众运动。今年麦子返青时，又在全社范围内开展了一次珍惜劳动果实的群众性大讨论，号召大家管好大田麦苗，也要管好废弃地的麦苗。各村还组织少年儿童护青，防止猪羊鸡鸭糟踏。此后，在麦田管理的各个环节，在评比参观、召开战地会议时，也都把废弃地庄稼生长情况作为一项内容。针对废弃地零星、就近，属于社员个人的特点，提出了“抓阴天，抓早晚，抓饭前饭后”等口号，让社员们利用这些空隙，管理好废弃地作物。关庄村张云才老汉感动地说：“共产党毛主席真是处处都在为着大家着想呀！”
    自春到冬积极积肥
    在马桥、裴桥、夏桥一带的村子里，院旁、路旁，有一座座整洁的厕所、猪圈；在坑边、塘岸旁还积有又黑又臭的污泥。农村里有厕所、猪圈、粪堆本是平常的事情，可是在这里却是一项重大的改革。这也是今年小麦丰收的重要原因之一。
    原来在这一带，地广人稀，每人平均十多亩地，土质不好，今天一场大雨，明天放晴，地就板结难耕。历年来人们只能广种薄收，大部土地不上粪，少部土地上粪也很少。这里人没有积肥习惯，直到去年以前，还有一些户“人无厕所猪无圈”。
    在去年大跃进的日子里，全县各级党委把修厕所、建猪圈、积肥施肥当作农业增产的根本措施，当作一项移风易俗的社会改革去完成。于是党、团员和积极分子带动群众，从桃红柳绿的春天到草枯水冷的严冬，将近一年里新建厕所七千八百二十个，猪圈九百一十五处，几辈子没有挖过的坑塘泥也挖出来了。公社化以后，人们力量更大，把肥料都送到田里，基本上消灭了“斋公田”。淤地一见粪土，庄稼长的格外好。李寨生产队已打的四十多亩麦子，比去年增长60％。社员李保言拿着肥大的麦子高兴的对干部说：“几辈人没上粪的地，上了粪长的真凶。今年的产量大跃进，是因为去年积肥大跃进呀！”
    往年吃国家　今年先交粮
    “再不要国家供应粮食了，保证节约粮食，超额完成夏粮征购任务。”提起小麦大丰收，从社员到干部，都异口同声地这样说。这话含义深长，只有吃国家供应粮食的人们懂得，这里有多少愉快，又有多少光荣和自豪感。
    在城关公社东关生产队的麦场里，庄永志老汉赶着牲口，唱着自己编的快板：“豆大的麦子千里香，高高麦垛堆场旁，趁天趁风快打晒，晒干扬净交公粮来卖余粮。……”张桂田老汉说：“往年俺吃国家的，今年大丰收啦，要先交公粮、卖余粮，还要交卖最好的。”
    酂城公社酂城大队的麦子已经割完，社员们便随打随晒随入库。6月8日已入库三万五千斤，他们计划在三天内超额完成征购任务。这个队的麦子按现在的估产粗略算了一下，完成征购任务，再扣除种籽、口粮、饲料，还有贮备粮。售粮款除发工资和适当改善社员生活外，还计划买牲口、马车、化肥、农药，力争秋季更大丰收。　（原载河南日报，有删节）
