Mending and Repairing, Renovating the Old

    New Shoe "Doctor"
    One day, a female customer came to the Qimei Leather Shoe Store on Huaihai Middle Road. She came to repair shoes. It turned out that a shoe buckle on her foot had broken halfway. The salesperson, Ding Rongquan, greeted her warmly, quickly repaired the shoe buckle, and also polished her shoes.
    This shoe store recently added a shoe repair workshop. In addition to a technician, the repair work is done by the store's salespersons. If the customer's leather shoe surface has a crack, they can sew it up immediately; if the sole is worn out, they can replace it with a new one; if the leather shoes are too big, they will take them apart and make them smaller; if they are too tight, they can use a special shoe stretcher to enlarge them. Suede shoes worn in winter can be dusted when they get dirty, and light-colored leather shoes worn in summer can also be dyed darker. Here, not only can adults' broken leather shoes be turned into beautiful children's shoes.

    Skillful Repair of Straw Mats
    If a mat has a hole, it is very uncomfortable to sleep on, and the small hole will soon loosen and turn into a big hole, until it becomes irreparable. The Shanghai Yichang Cotton Mat Shop can solve this problem for customers.
    The technicians' method of dealing with holes is very clever. For general holes, no matter where they are broken, as long as the straw at both ends of the hole is pulled out, and the straw on the left and right sides is pushed to the middle, the hole will disappear immediately. If the hemp thread connecting the straw is broken, they will use a special bamboo needle threaded with new hemp thread to connect it firmly, leaving no trace on the surface. If the mat is uneven, pulling out a few strands of straw can make it smooth and flat; if the edge of the mat is broken, they can also re-wrap it with a layer. Weaving and mending Taiwan mats is like a girl embroidering. The worker uses a thin needle, guiding the straw, weaving back and forth on the mat, and soon it is mended as good as new. Some mats for two people, if the holes are too big to repair, they can be made into small mats for one person, or they can be carefully calculated and made into one or several pillow mats.
    Every year in the summer, this business of Yichang Cotton Mat Shop becomes busy.

    New Business in Small Vegetable Market
    Early in the morning, the Danshui Road Vegetable Market is bustling with activity.
    In a corner of the vegetable market, someone is energetically sharpening knives. This is a knife sharpening place set up by the stallholders. If the kitchen knives used by housewives every day are blunt, making it inconvenient to chop meat and cut vegetables, they can bring them to the knife sharpening place when they go to the vegetable market in the morning, and pick them up the next day.
    The stallholders who operate the pork business in the vegetable market are responsible for sharpening knives. They generally have this skill, and take turns sharpening knives for customers every day, without affecting their business, but bringing great convenience to housewives.
    Next to the knife sharpening place, there is a basket repair place, which is a service project of the vegetable stallholders. They take bamboo strips from old vegetable baskets and repair the bottom of the baskets and replace the handles for the housewives. For small problems, they can be fixed immediately. In the past three months, they have repaired more than 500 vegetable baskets.

    New and Old Indistinguishable
    In the Friendship Camphorwood Chest Store, there are many renovated old camphorwood chests. These chests are almost identical to the newly manufactured ones. If it weren't for the salesperson's explanation, it would be difficult to tell that they were used for many years or even decades.
    The technicians here have unique skills. Some old camphorwood chests have cracks. They nail a camphorwood board on the back, fill the cracks with putty, and embed wood boards in the large cracks. The surface is then coated with a layer of reddish-brown paint powder. After such repair, almost no trace can be seen. If the damaged part of the lid is too large, the store can replace it with a new one.
    The most easily damaged parts of ordinary chests are the corners, locks, and handles. This store prepares all kinds of parts. If any part is broken, it can be repaired and replaced here.

    缝缝补补修旧翻
    新鞋“医生”
    一天，淮海中路上的奇美皮鞋店来了一位女顾客。她是来修鞋的。原来在半途她脚上的一只皮鞋鞋扣坏了。营业员丁荣全热情地接待了她，很快地把鞋扣修好，还给她的鞋子擦了油。
    这家皮鞋店不久以前增设了一个修鞋工场，担任修理的除了一名技工以外，都是店里的营业员。如果顾客的皮鞋面子裂了缝，可以立即给他缝好；鞋底磨穿了，可以给你配新底；皮鞋大了，他们会拆线改小；太紧了，又能用一种特殊的楦头把它放大。冬季穿的麂皮鞋，穿脏了可以擦粉，夏天穿的浅色皮鞋也可以染深。在这里，不但大人的破皮鞋可以改成漂亮的童鞋。
    巧修草席
    席子破了个洞，睡在上面很不舒适，而且小洞很快就会松散开来，变成大洞，以至不可收拾。上海义昌棉花席行可以为顾客解决这个问题。
    技工们对付破洞的办法十分巧妙。一般的洞眼，不论破在哪里，只要把破洞两头的席草抽掉，再把左右两边的席草往中间推拢，破洞马上失踪。遇到连接席草的麻线断裂，他们会用一种特殊的竹针穿上新麻线把它接牢，表面留不下丝毫的痕迹。席子不平，抽出几根席草，就可以抹得平平整整；席边破了，也能重包一层。织补台湾席真像姑娘绣花。只见工人?着一枚细针，引着席草，在席子上穿过来挑过去，不一会就补得完好如新。有些双人睡的席子，破洞过大无法修理，他们可以改成单人睡的小席，再不然也能给你精打细算地改成一张或几张枕头席。
    每年一到夏季，义昌棉花席行的这项业务就忙起来了。
    小菜场的新业务
    清晨，淡水路菜场上熙熙攘攘，十分热闹。
    菜场的一角，一个人正在起劲地磨刀。这是摊贩们设立的磨刀处。家庭主妇日常使用的菜刀钝了，斩肉切菜不方便，早晨上菜场的时候顺便带出来交给磨刀处，隔天就能取货。
    担任磨刀的是菜场经营猪肉的摊贩，他们一般都有这一手本领，每天轮流代客磨刀，不影响营业，却给主妇们带来了很大的便利。
    在磨刀处的旁边，有个修篮处，这是蔬菜摊贩的服务项目。他们从破旧的菜箩上取出竹篾，给主妇们补篮底、配拎攀。小毛病，立等可取。三个多月来，他们已经修好了五百多只菜篮。新　旧　难　辨
    在友谊樟木箱商店里，有不少翻新过的旧樟木箱。这些箱子同新制造的几乎一模一样，要不是营业员的说明，很难看出这是用过多年甚至几十年的旧货。
    这里的技工有着独到的手艺。有些旧樟木箱裂了缝，他们在背面钉上一块樟木板，裂缝处放进油灰，缝大的还嵌入木板，表面再涂一层红棕色的颜料粉，经过这样修补以后，几乎一点痕迹也看不出来。要是箱盖的破损地方太大，商店可以代配一个新的。
    一般箱子最容易坏的是箱角、箱锁和拎环。这家商店准备着各种各样的零件，任何一种零件坏了，都能在这里修配齐全。
