The radiance of the sun
Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Everyone knows that seriously addressing shortcomings and errors in our work, and earnestly carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the Party, is an important hallmark of a Marxist-Leninist party. But why do we do this? In my view, the reason is simple: because we are a Marxist-Leninist party, and we view problems from a dialectical materialist perspective.

The dialectical materialist perspective holds that the contradiction between the subjective and the objective is eternal, and that subjective understanding of the objective also requires a process. Therefore, wanting to do everything perfectly and flawlessly all at once, while a good aspiration, is unrealistic and impossible to achieve. Consequently, we never believe that our work will be 100% correct. Another reason is that our Party is one that serves the broad masses of the people and strives for their interests to the end. Therefore, seriously addressing shortcomings and errors in our work, and earnestly carrying out criticism and self-criticism, will lose us nothing except the shortcomings and errors themselves. What we will gain, however, is smoother progress in our work and more enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the people. This is a very old principle for Marxists-Leninists. However, in our actual work, we often do not understand it, or do not understand it deeply enough.

Some people are afraid to talk about shortcomings and errors, perhaps out of a desire to safeguard our cause. They believe that mentioning them will affect the greatness of the cause we are engaged in, and the correctness of the work we are doing. They should know that, for a Marxist-Leninist party like ours, under the guidance of the correct line, achievements are always primary, and shortcomings and errors are secondary, and always to be overcome and corrected. The situation since the founding of the country ten years ago is proof enough. In just ten years, judging from the growth of industrial and agricultural production, and the rapid improvement of people's living standards, we have made unprecedented and enormous achievements. Ten years have far surpassed the achievements of the past decades and centuries. Nevertheless, this does not mean that our work in the past ten years has been without any shortcomings and errors. I think that seriously addressing the shortcomings and errors in our work will not detract from the greatness of our cause or the achievements of our work. On the contrary, only in this way can we more deeply recognize the greatness of past achievements, and better achieve even greater achievements in future work.

When I think of this issue, I often think of the radiance of the sun. I think it is most appropriate to use the radiance of the sun to describe the great cause of building socialism led by our Party and undertaken by 600 million people. Just think, the mountains and rivers are magnificent and varied, but without the illumination of the sun, they would suddenly lose their luster. All living things are thriving and full of life, but without the nurturing of the sun, they would gradually wither and die. Not to mention, the light and heat of the sun provide us with the necessities for our survival.

I think the broad masses of the people understand this very deeply. They use "darkness" to describe the rule of the exploiting classes in the past. They longed for liberation and strived for liberation with the feeling of "when will the long night end?" They use "The East is Red, the sun rises" to describe the vigorous vitality of our great cause. They use "as constant as the sun" to bless the increasing development and consolidation of our great cause. They use the sun to praise our cause, to praise our Party and our leaders. These are all obvious examples.

But who has ever said that the sun has no shortcomings? Although the sun is indispensable for human survival, there are always people who criticize some of the sun's shortcomings. For example, when the scorching sun burns like fire during the hottest days of summer, causing people to sweat, people will complain, saying that the sun's light and heat are emitted excessively. And everyone knows and points out that there are sunspots on the sun itself. Although these are facts, who has ever doubted that humanity can do without the sun? Who has ever denied its brilliant radiance because the sun itself has sunspots? No one. I think that our Party, and the great cause led by our Party, is exactly like this. We don't need to be afraid of mentioning shortcomings and errors. On the contrary, when we realize the greatness of the cause we are engaged in, and the enormous victories and achievements we have made in our work, we should even more modestly listen to everyone's discussion of the shortcomings and errors in our work. This will help us move forward in great strides. This has always been the fine tradition and style of our Party, but we often forget this style when our work is going smoothly.

Some comrades are unwilling to listen to shortcomings and errors because they lack the broad-mindedness that a revolutionary must possess. Let's look at the sun that shines on the earth. See how it shines its light and heat on every corner from morning to night, never stinting, never being partial, never calculating rewards. It is so selfless, so wholeheartedly emitting light and heat for the people. What broad-mindedness this is! If we have such broad-mindedness, what else can we not tolerate? Why can't we listen to and correct our own shortcomings and errors? Especially when we understand that correcting and overcoming shortcomings and errors will be even more beneficial to the interests of the people. Shouldn't every Party member, every revolutionary worker, have a bright and open-mindedness like the sun?

In fact, we have been doing this. We work day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep. Together with the 600 million people, we hold a strong desire to change our country's backward state of "poverty and blankness," and we work selflessly. Isn't this the selfless spirit of the sun? Since we have such a lofty and strong desire, and since we have such a selfless working spirit, then why are we afraid to mention shortcomings and errors? Why are we afraid to carry out criticism and self-criticism?

We must know that, due to the limitations of our subjective understanding of objective laws, it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings and errors in our work. Therefore, I always believe that for a good revolutionary, as long as he serves the people wholeheartedly, the question is not whether there are shortcomings and errors in his work (of course, we must try our best to avoid them), but whether he seriously addresses the shortcomings and errors. There is no one who does not have shortcomings and errors in his work, unless he does not work. The same is true for a political party.

There is also the question of nine fingers and one finger. It is undoubtedly very appropriate to use nine fingers and one finger to describe that achievements are primary and shortcomings and errors are secondary in our work. However, this does not mean that we only talk about the nine fingers and not the one finger, nor does it mean that the one finger no longer exists. Some comrades cannot stand other people's criticisms, cannot stand other people's critical articles. As soon as they hear or see them, they jump up and say, why don't people see the nine fingers, why do people deny our achievements. This is a one-sided view, and it is harmful to our cause.

I believe that as long as it is in the spirit of doing a good job in socialist construction, we should allow everyone to freely discuss. We can discuss the nine fingers, we can discuss the nine fingers and the one finger at the same time, and we can also discuss the one finger. Our cause itself has long proven that the one finger, just like the sunspot in the sun is just a sunspot, it should be welcomed when it is pointed out. Why should we oppose it? Mencius said: "The mistakes of ancient gentlemen were like eclipses of the sun and moon, which the people all saw; and when they corrected them, the people all looked up to them." If an ancient gentleman could do this, then a Party member, a revolutionary, can certainly do this even better, because our dedication to serving the masses and the Party's position in the hearts of the masses is many times higher than that of an ancient gentleman.

Some comrades are also afraid that talking about shortcomings will be used by reactionaries. I don't think there is anything to fear about this. Because even if we don't talk about shortcomings, they will spread rumors and slanders. They just fear that we will not be in "great chaos." Therefore, from the bottom of their hearts, reactionaries are afraid of us talking about shortcomings, because this will be more beneficial to our cause, and more unfavorable to them.

For the sake of our cause having greater development, and for the sake of our work achieving greater successes, I hope that we will not only discuss our great achievements, but also discuss our shortcomings and errors. I also hope that some comrades will not only be good at listening to others discuss achievements, but also be good at listening to others discuss shortcomings and errors.

    太阳的光辉
    中共广东省委第一书记　陶铸
    谁都知道，认真地对待工作中的缺点和错误，认真地在党内开展批评与自我批评，是马克思列宁主义政党的重要的标志。但是，为什么要这样做呢？我看，原因很简单，因为我们是马克思列宁主义的党，是用辩证唯物论的观点看待问题的。
    辩证唯物论的观点认为：主观和客观上的矛盾是永远存在的，主观认识客观也是需要一个过程的，因而想一下子就把工作做得十全十美，完整无缺，愿望虽然是一个好愿望，但是它不合乎实际，是个没法实现的好愿望。因此，我们从来就不认为我们的工作会百分之百的正确。另外一个原因，就是因为我们的党是一个为广大人民群众服务，为广大人民群众利益奋斗到底的政党，因此，认真地对待工作中的缺点和错误，认真地进行批评与自我批评，除了失掉缺点和错误外，任什么都不会失掉。而得到的却将是使工作更顺利的进行，是广大人民群众更热烈的拥护。本来，对于马克思列宁主义者说来，这是很老的道理了。但是我们在实际工作中却往往不懂得或是懂得不够深刻。
    有的人怕谈缺点和错误，也许是从维护我们的事业出发吧，他们认为一谈就会影响我们所从事的事业的伟大，影响我们所做的工作的正确。要知道，像我们这样一个马克思列宁主义的党，在正确的路线引领下，成绩总是主要的，缺点和错误总是次要的，而且总是要被克服和改正的。远的不说，从开国十年来的情况完全可以得到证明。仅仅是十年时间，从工农业生产增长的情况来看，从人民生活水平迅速的提高来看，我们都取得了史无前例的巨大成就。十年的时间远远地超过了过去几十年、几百年的成就。尽管如此，但它并不意味着我们十年来的工作丝毫没有缺点和错误。我想，认真地对待我们工作中的缺点和错误，并无损于我们事业的伟大与工作的成绩。相反地，只有如此，我们才能更深刻地认识过去成绩的巨大，才能更好地在今后工作中取得更大成绩。
    一想到这个问题，就常想到太阳的光辉。我看用太阳的光辉来比喻我们党所领导着的、六亿人民所从事的建设社会主义的伟大事业，是再恰当不过的了。我们试想想看，山川大地壮丽奇瑰，可谓多采多姿了，但如果没有太阳的照耀，它将顿然失去光采；万物生灵蓬蓬勃勃，可谓生机万类了，但如果没有太阳的浴泽，它们将逐渐枯萎以至死亡。更不要说，太阳的光与热给我们的生存所带来的所必须的东西了。
    我看广大人民群众对这一点理解得是很深刻的。他们用“黑夜”来形容过去剥削阶级的统治；他们以“漫漫长夜何时旦”的心情来渴望解放，争取解放；他们以“东方红，太阳升”来形容我们伟大事业的朝气勃勃；他们以“如日之恒”来祝福我们伟大事业的日益发展和巩固；他们以太阳来歌颂我们的事业，歌颂我们的党和领袖。这都是很明显的例证。
    但是，又有谁说过太阳毫无缺点呢？尽管太阳是人类生存不可缺少的，但总还是有人批评太阳的某些过失。譬如当大暑天骄阳似火，晒得人们流汗的时候，人们就会埋怨，说太阳的光和热发射得过分了。而且大家都知道并且也都指出过，太阳本身上还有黑点。虽然这些都是事实，但谁个曾怀疑人类可以不需要太阳呢？谁个曾因为太阳本身有黑点就否认了它的灿烂光辉呢？没有。我想，我们的党，我们的党所领导下的伟大事业，也正是如此。我们用不着怕提缺点和错误，相反地，当我们意识到我们所从事的事业的伟大性，以及工作中所取得的胜利和成绩的巨大性以后，我们更应该虚怀若谷地倾听大家议论我们工作中的缺点和错误。它将会帮助我们大踏步地前进。这本来是我们党的优良传统作风，但我们往往在工作顺利的情况下，把这种作风忘掉了。
    有些同志不愿听缺点和错误，还由于缺少一种革命者所必须具有的宽阔胸襟。还是看看那普照大地的太阳吧，你看它从朝到晚，把它的光和热照在每一个角落，从不吝惜，从不偏袒，从不计较报酬，它那样大公无私，那样一心一意地为人民发射光和热；这是何等宽阔的胸怀！如果有了这样的胸怀，还有什么容不下的东西呢？还为什么不能听取并改正自己的缺点和错误呢？尤其是当他理解到缺点和错误的改正和克服，对人民利益将更大的时候。我们每一个党员，每一个革命工作者，不都是应该具有太阳一样的光明磊落的胸怀吗？
    实际上，我们也是这样做了。我们废寝忘食，夜以继日地工作着，我们同六亿人民一起，对改变我国“一穷二白”落后面貌抱着强烈的愿望，奋不顾身地工作着，难道这不是太阳那种大公无私的精神么？我们既然有这样一种崇高的强烈的愿望，既然有这样一种奋不顾身的工作精神，那我们为什么怕提缺点和错误，为什么怕进行批评和自我批评呢？
    要知道，由于我们主观上对客观规律认识的局限性，在工作中有缺点和错误是难免的；所以，我总认为，一个好的革命者，只要他是全心全意为人民服务的，问题不在于工作中有没有缺点和错误（当然我们要尽量避免），而是要认真地对待缺点和错误。在工作中没有缺点和错误的人是没有的。除非他不做工作。一个政党也是如此。
    同样的问题，还有九个指头与一个指头的问题。用九个指头与一个指头来形容我们工作中成绩是主要的，缺点和错误是次要的，无疑是非常恰当的。但是，这决不等于只谈九个指头，不谈一个指头；更不等于那一个指头已经不存在。有些同志听不得人家的批评，看不得人家的批评文章，一听到看到就跳了起来，说人家为什么不看到九个指头，说人家为什么否定我们的成绩。这是片面的看法，对我们的事业是有害的。
    我认为，只要是本着搞好社会主义建设的精神，我们应该允许大家自由地议论，九个指头可以议论，九个指头与一个指头可以同时议论，一个指头也可以议论。我们的事业本身早已证明，一个指头，正如同太阳中的黑点也仅只是黑点一样，指出来正应该欢迎，为什么要反对呢？孟子说：“古之君子，其过也，如日月之食，民皆见之；及其更也，民皆仰之。”如果说一个古君子能做到这样，一个党员，一个革命者，就更能做到这样了，因为我们为群众工作之心，党在群众心目中的地位，不知比古君子要高多少倍。
    有些同志还怕谈缺点会被反动派利用。我看这一点不用怕。因为我们不谈缺点他们也会造谣中伤。他们就是唯恐我们不“天下大乱”。所以，从骨子里来看，反动派是怕我们谈缺点的，因为这将对我们的事业更加有利，而对他们却更加不妙。
    为了我们的事业有着更大的发展，为了我们的工作取得更大的成绩，我希望我们不但议论我们的伟大成就，并且也议论我们的缺点和错误。也希望有些同志不但善于听取别人议论成就，也善于听取别人议论缺点和错误。
