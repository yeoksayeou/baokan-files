Adding Population and Increasing Longevity
Rapid Population Growth Among Ethnic Minorities in Inner Mongolia and Guizhou

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: Since the liberation in 1945, the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities such as the Oroqen and Ewenki in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have completely changed the tragic situation of population decline in the past and have seen a prosperous population growth. Currently, the Mongolian population has increased from more than 840,000 in 1950 to more than 1,130,000. The Oroqen population has increased from more than 910 to more than 1,100, and the Ewenki population has increased from more than 5,200 to more than 6,800. The Daur, Hui, Manchu, and Korean ethnic minorities in the autonomous region have also prospered year by year.

In the nearly hundred years before liberation, the ethnic minorities in Inner Mongolia suffered cruel oppression and exploitation from imperialism, domestic reactionaries, and reactionary forces within the ethnic groups. The economy was declining, culture was backward, and medical and health facilities were extremely poor. Various malignant infectious diseases and endemic diseases spread year after year, causing a sharp decline in population and seriously threatening the continuation of the ethnic groups. The Ikh Chao League, which had a Mongolian population of 400,000 in the early Qing Dynasty, was reduced to more than 100,000 before liberation. In the Xilin Gol grasslands, at the end of the Qing Dynasty, there were more than 84,000 Mongolians engaged in nomadic life, but by 1936, only more than 36,000 remained. In the dark days of the past, it was difficult to see healthy children on the vast grasslands and in the primitive forests.

After liberation, Inner Mongolia realized regional autonomy with the Mongolian ethnic group as the main body. The Communist Party and the People's Government were very concerned about the health and prosperity of all ethnic groups, and organized a large number of medical personnel to go deep into the vast pastoral areas to carry out free prevention and treatment of venereal diseases. Later, with the development of maternal and child health, prevention and treatment of brucellosis, and the patriotic health movement, medical and health institutions at all levels were gradually established. Now, venereal diseases, which seriously hindered the development of the Mongolian ethnic group, have been basically eliminated in major pastoral areas. Mongolian herdsmen who have escaped the pain of illness are quickly having healthy babies. The Oroqen ethnic group, which generally enjoys free medical care, has also turned from a downward trend to an upward trend in population with the improvement of living standards and the establishment of medical institutions.

The rapid improvement of the health level of all ethnic minorities in the autonomous region and the increasing prosperity of the population have powerfully promoted the development of various production and construction undertakings.

(By our newspaper) Guizhou Province has seen a rapid increase in the population of ethnic minorities. According to the latest national statistics, the population of more than ten ethnic groups, including the Miao, Buyi, Dong, Yi, Shui, and Gelao, in the province reached 4.36 million by the end of 1958, a net increase of more than 420,000 compared with 1953, the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan.

The Guizhou Plateau is the main distribution area of the Miao ethnic group in China. In the past five years, the number of Miao people in the province has increased from 1.42 million to 1.53 million. The population growth of some ethnic groups with smaller populations is even more significant. For example, the Shui ethnic group along the Du’liu River had more than 160,000 people in 1958, an increase of nearly a quarter compared with 1953. Whether in an ethnic minority village or an autonomous prefecture or county, "adding population and increasing longevity" has become a new atmosphere.

Before liberation, the ethnic minority working people of Guizhou suffered discrimination and oppression, and the population continued to decline. According to statistics, there were only 1.23 million people in 1939. After the liberation in 1949, the ethnic minority people of Guizhou, like the vast number of Han brothers, carried out land reform and socialist transformation, production developed, living standards improved, and people were in a happy mood. In addition, with the gradual establishment of medical networks in ethnic minority areas, malaria, which was the most harmful to ethnic minorities, has been basically eliminated in most areas, and the health level of ethnic minority people has improved. The widespread promotion of modern midwifery has put an end to the tragic scene of "only seeing mothers pregnant but not seeing children walking" in the history of ethnic minority areas, and directly promoted the increase in the birth rate. In the past five years, the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture has seen a net increase of more than 30,000 people every year. The Daqiao Production Team of the Daqiao Commune in Huangping County has a total of 655 people, and there are more than 100 children under the age of five. The production team leader said with a smile, "Since the Miao people have had the leadership of Chairman Mao, our team has added twenty or thirty babies every year. It is truly a family of sons and grandsons, and the population is prosperous!"

    添丁增口  人寿年丰
    内蒙古贵州少数民族人口迅速增长
    新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古自治区的蒙古和鄂伦春、鄂温克等少数民族，自1945年解放以来，完全改变了昔日人口下降的悲惨局面，出现了人丁兴旺的景象。目前，蒙古族人口已由1950年的八十四万多人，增加到一百一十三万多人，鄂伦春族由九百一十多人增加到一千一百多人，鄂温克族由五千二百多人增加到六千八百多人。自治区境内的达斡尔、回、满和朝鲜等少数民族，也逐年繁荣起来。
    解放前的近百年来，内蒙古各少数民族长期遭受着帝国主义、国内反动派和民族内部反动势力的残酷压迫和剥削，经济衰敝，文化落后，医药卫生设施十分恶劣，各种恶性传染病、地方病，常年蔓延不息，造成人口急剧下降，民族的延续受到严重威胁。在清朝初年拥有四十万蒙古族人口的伊克昭盟，到解放以前减少到十万多人。锡林郭勒草原在清朝末年，有八万四千多蒙古人从事游牧生活，到1936年只剩下三万六千多人。在过去黑暗的日子里，广阔的草原上和原始密林里，人们很难看到健康的孩子。
    解放后，内蒙古实现了以蒙古民族为主体的区域自治。共产党和人民政府对各族人民的健康和繁荣十分关怀，组织大批医疗人员，深入广大牧区进行性病的免费防治工作，以后又随着妇幼卫生、布氏杆菌病的防治等工作和爱国卫生运动的开展，逐步建立了各级医疗卫生机构。现在，严重妨碍蒙古民族发展的性病，已在各大牧区基本消灭。摆脱了病痛的蒙古族牧民们，很快抱上了健康的娃娃。普遍享受公费医疗的鄂伦春民族，随着生活改善和医疗机构的建立，人口也由下降局势转为上升。
    自治区各少数民族健康水平的迅速提高和人口日趋兴旺，有力地促进了各项生产建设事业的发展。
    本报讯　贵州省少数民族人口迅速增加。根据最近的国家统计资料，全省苗、布依、侗、彝、水、仡佬等十多个民族人口，到1958年年底止，已达到四百三十六万，比第一个五年计划开始的1953年净增四十二万多人。
    贵州高原，是我国苗族主要分布的地区。五年中，全省苗族已从一百四十二万增加到一百五十三万。一些人数较少的民族，人口增长程度更为显著。像都柳江边的水族，1958年已有十六万多人，比1953年增加近四分之一。不论在一个少数民族村寨，或一个自治州、县，“添丁进口、人寿年丰”已成为一种新气象。
    解放前，贵州的少数民族劳动人民，受尽歧视、压迫，人口不断减少。据统计，1939年只有一百二十三万人。1949年解放以后，贵州少数民族人民和广大汉族兄弟一样，进行了土地改革和社会主义改造，生产发展，生活改善，人们心情舒畅。加上少数民族地区医疗网的逐渐建立，危害少数民族最厉害的疟疾，已在大部地区基本消灭，少数民族人民健康水平，有了提高。而新法接生的普遍推广，使少数民族地区历史上“只见娘怀胎、不见儿走路”的悲惨景象，一去永不复返，直接促进了出生率上升。黔东南苗族侗族自治州五年来，每年净增三万多人。黄平县大桥公社大桥生产队共六百五十五人，五岁以下的小孩就有一百多个，生产队长笑哈哈地对人说：“自从苗家有了毛主席领导，我们队哪年不添二、三十个娃娃，真是家家户户儿孙满堂，人口兴旺！”（附图片）
