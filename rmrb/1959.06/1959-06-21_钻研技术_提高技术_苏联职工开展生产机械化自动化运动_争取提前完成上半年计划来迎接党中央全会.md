Study Technology, Improve Skills
Soviet Workers Launch Mechanization and Automation Movement
Strive to Complete First Half-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule to Greet Party Central Committee Plenum

(TASS Moscow News) To welcome the CPSU Central Committee Plenum scheduled to be held on June 24th, a mass competition to complete the first half-year production plan before the opening of the plenum has been launched, first in Moscow and Leningrad, and then in various republics and states.

The Soviet economic zones basically completed the plan on schedule in the first five months of this year. A preliminary summary of the work of the Soviet industrial sector shows that such a task is entirely realistic.

This movement, which has been carried out in all industrial centers, not only shows people's hope to complete the planned tasks on schedule, but also an unprecedentedly widespread movement in the industrial and scientific and technological circles to strive for automation and mechanization of technological processes.

Almost no large enterprise has not discussed mechanization and automation issues in these days and taken some practical steps in the production of technical improvement teams. Newspapers and radio stations report many facts about the opening of new automatic lines and the automation of various combined units every day.

The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions supports the experience of the Moscow First Ball Bearing Factory and the Kharkov Transport Machinery Manufacturing Factory in Ukraine in the mechanization and automation of production. Their experience has been recommended for widespread promotion.

What are the characteristics of these enterprises?

The Moscow factory is the world's largest in terms of ball bearing production, with the same number of workers on the same area. The factory has doubled its production in the past seven years.

The workers of the First Ball Bearing Factory have used the enterprise's capabilities to the limit. However, after thousands of staff members carefully studied the potential for future mechanization and automation, they realized that with the same number of people and on the same area, they could increase the production of ball bearings by another 75% by the end of 1965. This is equivalent to establishing a new large ball bearing factory. This surge in production is mainly achieved by tapping the potential within the enterprise.

During the period of 1959-1965, the Moscow factory will also add five such automated workshops. Here, there will be no need for human labor to produce. Due to the improvement of the factory's technical level, new types of worker intellectuals will emerge. For example, in the automated workshop, one out of every four workers is a graduate of a university or technical school or a graduate of this year. In the factory, one out of every three workers is studying. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, this enterprise will become a factory like a higher technical school.

The Kharkov Transport Machinery Manufacturing Factory, which produces internal combustion locomotives, is also famous for its production innovation.

These two factories are not special compared to other factories, but their achievements in technological progress are more or less typical for the entire Soviet industry. Soviet workers often say: "Production automation and mechanization are the two wings of the Seven-Year Plan." On the eve of the Party Central Committee Plenum, they are doing everything they can to spread their wings and fly high.

### 钻研技术　提高技术  苏联职工开展生产机械化自动化运动  争取提前完成上半年计划来迎接党中央全会

    钻研技术　提高技术
    苏联职工开展生产机械化自动化运动
    争取提前完成上半年计划来迎接党中央全会
    本报讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：为了迎接定于6月24日召开的苏共中央全会，首先在莫斯科和列宁格勒，后来在各共和国和各个州，纷纷展开了争取在全会开会之前完成上半年产品计划的群众性竞赛。
    今年头五个月苏联各经济区基本上按期完成了计划。对苏联工业部门工作的初步总结表明，这样的任务是完全现实的。
    在所有工业中心开展起来的这种运动不仅仅说明人们希望按期完成计划任务，而在工业和科学技术界也空前广泛地开始了争取工艺过程自动化和机械化的运动。
    差不多没有一个大企业在这些日子里没有讨论机械化、自动化问题和在提高技术小组的生产方面采取某种实际步骤。报刊和电台每天都报道很多关于开辟新的自动线路和关于各种联合机组自动化等事实。
    全苏工会中央理事会支持莫斯科第一滚珠轴承工厂和乌克兰哈尔科夫运输机械制造工厂在生产机械化和自动化中的经验。它们的经验已被推荐用来广泛推广。
    这些企业到底有什么特点呢？
    莫斯科这个工厂就滚珠轴承生产来说，在同样的面积上，用同样多的工人，是世界上最大的。这个工厂最近七年来产品增加了一倍。
    第一滚珠轴承工厂工人利用企业的能力已到了极限。但是，当成千上万的全体工作人员精密地研究过今后机械化和自动化的潜力之后，才知道以同样多的人员和在同样的面积上，他们到1965年年底可以再使滚珠轴承产量提高75％。这就等于建立一个新的大型滚珠轴承工厂。这种生产高涨，基本上是靠企业内部的潜力来实现的。
    1959—1965年期间，莫斯科的这家工厂还要增加五个这样自动化的车间。这里将不须人来动手生产。由于工厂技术水平的提高，将出现新型的工人知识分子。比如，在自动化车间，每四个工人当中就有一个高等学校或技术学校的毕业生或今年毕业的毕业生。在工厂中，每三个工人中有一个工人在学习。到七年计划末，这个企业将成为一所高等技术学校式的工厂。
    生产内燃机车的哈尔科夫运输机械制造工厂也以生产革新而著名。
    这两个工厂和其他工厂比较起来没有任何特殊的地方，但是它们在技术进步方面所作出的成绩，对整个苏联工业来说或多或少具有典型意义。苏联工人常说：“生产自动化和机械化是七年计划的两个翅膀”。在党中央全会的前夕，他们正在竭尽一切努力展翅高飞。
