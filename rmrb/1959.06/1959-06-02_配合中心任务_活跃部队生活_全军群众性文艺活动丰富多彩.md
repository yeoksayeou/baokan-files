Xinhua News Agency, 31st - The Chinese People's Liberation Army's magnificent mass cultural and artistic activities have made rapid progress in recent years, playing a significant role in coordinating with the troops to complete central tasks in various periods, enlivening troop life, and cultivating the excellent qualities of soldiers.

Now, some troops have evening parties every week and performances every month. Some troops have also held poetry contests, poetry recitals, and poetry and painting exhibitions. Various units have established soldiers' amateur performance teams. According to statistics from the Beijing Military Region, there are more than 1,000 such teams. Members of the performance teams include gunners, sailors, pilots, signalmen, cooks, nurses, clerks, and even staff members and officers' family members serving in the army. The Fujian Front troops held a cultural review conference this spring, with 735 staff members from various units participating in the performances. Division Commander Xu Guangyou not only personally arranged a "Red Army Song Medley" for the soldiers' performance team but also served as the lead singer in the medley. In a certain company stationed on Hainan Island, from officers to soldiers, everyone can perform on stage. Last winter, the company's amateur performance team toured 16 performances in various units of the regiment, which were widely welcomed.

With the popularization and in-depth development of mass cultural and artistic activities in the troops, the amateur creative activities of the vast number of officers and soldiers have also achieved great success in recent years. The quantity and quality of the works have greatly improved compared with the past. According to incomplete statistics from a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region, from September 1957 to March 1959, the leading organs of this unit received more than 12,500 literary and artistic works of various forms written by officers and soldiers. Since 1953, 501 various literary and artistic works of this unit have won awards in literary and artistic performances and literary creation competitions, and 589 various works such as novels, poems, ballads, and fine arts have been published in military and provincial-level literary and artistic publications. Since 1955, they have also published ten collections of essays such as "Soldiers in Their Hometowns" and "Waves." The Fourth Detachment of a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region created 1,200 high-quality literary and artistic works such as songs, dances, and storytelling in three and a half months. Among the 271 programs performed in the Guangzhou Military Region's New Year's Day literary and artistic performance this year, 248 programs were created by the officers and soldiers themselves. Self-created programs accounted for 91.5% of all performances. In the Air Force literary and artistic performance held in March this year alone, 97 of the Air Force's own literary and artistic works won excellent work awards and work awards.

In extensive artistic activities, various troops have cultivated and produced a large number of artistic backbones. In recent years, a certain army has trained more than 15,800 artistic backbones in creation, singing, dancing, fine arts, and accordion. The Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region has cultivated 39 artistic backbones of various types in recent years' artistic activities. The broad masses of commanders and fighters have demonstrated their talents in various artistic creations. Since 1953, 234 performers from the soldiers' amateur performance team of a certain unit have been rated as excellent actors in the performances. In order to better express the fighting life and ideological feelings of the troops, many amateur performance teams boldly promoted the spirit of artistic innovation and adopted many novel artistic expressions. A modern dance drama expressing modern life, self-compiled by a certain unit of the Navy, absorbed the essence of folk dances, local music, and fishermen's songs. The songs and dances praising the victory of air combat, self-compiled by some troops, cleverly used the stage steps and music of Peking Opera martial arts.

The main characteristics of mass cultural and artistic activities in the troops are that they are short, concise, and militant. It is closely integrated with the current central tasks of the troops, quickly reflects the new face of the troops' continuous growth, and effectively mobilizes, educates, and inspires the broad masses of officers and soldiers. For example, the programs performed by the Fujian Front troops are full of a fiery fighting atmosphere and revolutionary heroism, praising the advanced deeds and heroic figures in the front line's struggle against the enemy. This has played a significant role in promoting the communist spirit and inspiring the fighting spirit of the troops. Many troops performing training tasks stationed in Shenyang, Wuhan and other places are also very active in gun-杆诗 (gun-pole poetry) activities. In addition, amateur performance teams from the Navy, Air Force, and Shenyang Military Region often organize propaganda teams to go deep into the countryside to carry out propaganda. In order to cooperate with the propaganda of the general line, a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region compiled more than 10,000 literary and artistic works and organized more than 100 propaganda teams to carry out extensive propaganda to the broad masses of the people in the streets and alleys.

In carrying out mass cultural and artistic work, various troops have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought and the General Political Department's instruction of "facing the company and serving the soldiers." Party committees and leading cadres at all levels attach great importance to literary and artistic work, fully utilize the mass line method, combine leadership, expertise, and the masses, and combine popularization and improvement, thus continuously improving the literary and artistic work of the troops. In recent years, especially after the rectification campaign, professional literary and artistic workers in the troops have gone down to the company to train, which has also done a lot of counseling work for the mass cultural and artistic activities of the troops and promoted the development of literary and artistic work in the troops.

    配合中心任务　活跃部队生活
    全军群众性文艺活动丰富多彩
    新华社31日讯　中国人民解放军规模壮阔的群众性文化艺术活动，几年来有了突飞猛进的发展，在配合部队完成各个时期的中心任务，活跃部队生活和培养战士优良品质等方面，发挥了巨大的作用。
    现在，有些部队周周有晚会、月月有演出。有些部队还举行了赛诗会、诗歌朗诵会和诗画展览会。各部队纷纷建立了战士业余演出队，据北京部队统计，就有战士业余演出队一千多个。参加演出队的成员有炮手、水兵、飞行员、通讯兵、炊事兵、护士、文书，还有在部队服务的职工和军官家属等。福建前线部队今春举行了文艺检阅大会，参加会演的各单位的各种工作人员即达七百三十五人。师长徐光友，不但为战士演出队亲自整理了“红军歌曲联唱”，并且在联唱节目中担任领唱。驻海南岛部队某连，从军官到士兵，人人都能登台表演。去年冬天，这个连的业余演出队，在本部队各单位巡回演出了十六场，受到普遍的欢迎。
    随着部队群众性文艺活动的普及和深入发展，几年来，部队广大官兵的业余创作活动也获得很大的成绩。作品的数量和质量都比过去有很大提高。据济南部队某部不完全统计，从1957年9月到1959年3月，这个部队的领导机关共收到官兵们写的各种文艺形式的作品一万二千五百多件。从1953年以来，这个部队在文艺会演和文艺创作评奖中得奖的各种文艺作品有五百零一件，在军队和省以上的文艺刊物上发表的小说、诗歌、曲艺、美术等各种作品也有五百八十九件。从1955年以来，他们还出版了“战士在故乡”、
  “浪花”等十个文集。南京部队某部四分队，在三个半月中创作了质量较高的歌曲、舞蹈、说唱等文艺作品一千二百件。广州部队在今年元旦举行文艺会演演出的二百七十一个节目中，有二百四十八个节目是官兵们自己创作的。自己创作的节目占全部演出节目的91.5％。空军部队自己创作的文艺作品，仅在今年3月举行的空军文艺会演中，得到优秀作品奖和作品奖的就有九十七个。
    在广泛的文艺活动中，各部队培养和涌现出大批文艺骨干。某军几年来，共训练了创作、歌咏、舞蹈、美术、手风琴等各种文艺骨干一万五千八百多名。广州部队某部九连，在近年来的文艺活动中培养出各种文艺骨干三十九人。广大指战员在各种艺术创作上，表现了自己的才能。某部战士业余演出队从1953年以来，在会演中有二百三十四名表演者被评为优秀演员。为了更好地表现部队的斗争生活和思想感情，不少业余演出队大胆地发扬了艺术上的革新精神，采用了许多新颖的艺术表现手法。海军某部自编的表现现代生活的舞剧，吸取了民间舞蹈、地方音乐和渔歌等民间艺术的精华。有的部队自编的歌颂空战胜利的歌舞，巧妙地运用了京剧武戏的台步和音乐。
    部队群众性文艺活动的主要特点，是短小精悍，富有战斗性。它紧密地结合了当前部队的中心任务，迅速地反映了部队不断成长的新面貌，有力地动员、教育、鼓舞了广大官兵。如福建前线部队，在演出的节目中充满了火热的战斗气氛和革命英雄主义气概，歌颂了前线对敌斗争中的先进事迹和英雄人物。这对发扬共产主义精神，鼓舞部队的斗志起了重大的作用。驻沈阳、武汉等地许多执行训练任务的部队，枪杆诗活动也很活跃。此外，海军空军和沈阳部队等的业余演出队还常常组织宣传队，深入农村进行宣传。南京部队某部为了配合宣传总路线，编了各种文艺作品一万多件，组织了宣传队一百多个，到街头巷尾向广大人民群众进行了广泛的宣传。
    各部队在开展群众性文艺工作中，坚决贯彻了毛主席文艺思想和总政治部“面向连队，为兵服务”的指示。各级党委和领导干部对文艺工作十分重视，充分运用群众路线的方法，使领导、专业与群众三结合，使普及和提高相结合，因而使部队的文艺工作不断得到提高。几年来，特别是整风以后，部队专业文艺工作者下放连队锻炼，也为部队群众性的文艺活动做了很多辅导工作，推动了部队文艺工作的开展。
