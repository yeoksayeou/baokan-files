    On Enrollment in Institutions of Higher Education
    People's Letters and Visits Office of the Ministry of Education

    Recently, some young people preparing to apply to institutions of higher education have written to inquire about specific issues related to this year's enrollment. We now provide a comprehensive response as follows.

    Question: Can candidates who have already applied to schools with separate admissions also apply to schools with unified admissions?

    Answer: Candidates who have already applied to schools with separate admissions can also apply to schools with unified admissions, provided that the examination times do not conflict. If a candidate travels to another province, city, or autonomous region to apply to a school with separate admissions and cannot return to their original examination area in time to apply to a school with unified admissions, they can apply to the local enrollment institution with proof of application from the school with separate admissions. However, this is limited to applying to schools and departments (majors) that have enrollment quotas in the candidate's original province, city, or autonomous region.

    To avoid duplicate admissions and ensure the smooth completion of enrollment plans for all types of schools, freshmen admitted by schools with separate admissions will not be allowed to apply to schools with unified admissions, and those who have already applied will not be admitted. Similarly, if some schools with separate admissions conduct enrollment after the unified admissions examinations, freshmen admitted by schools with unified admissions will not be allowed to apply to schools with separate admissions, and those who have already applied will not be admitted.

    Question: Can candidates with specific professional foundations or special skills, as well as other special reasons, apply to schools in other provinces, cities, or autonomous regions?

    Answer: Enrollment in institutions of higher education should implement the principle of recruiting locally. However, due to the current imbalance between the distribution of candidates and the enrollment tasks of institutions of higher education, unified arrangements have been made for the geographical scope of enrollment for each school to adjust the quantity and quality of new students and ensure the completion of the enrollment plans for all types of institutions of higher education. Therefore, candidates should still apply to schools that are enrolling locally. If a candidate does have a specific professional foundation or special skill, and there are no such schools or departments (majors) enrolling locally, or if there are other special reasons that necessitate applying to a school in another province, city, or autonomous region, they must obtain the consent of the local enrollment institution and be issued a letter of introduction allowing them to apply to the other province, city, or autonomous region before applying.

    Question: Why are candidates applying to medical, agricultural, forestry, and physical education disciplines in this year's college entrance examination not tested on the fundamentals of Darwinism, but instead tested on biology?

    Answer: According to the teaching plan of ordinary middle schools, this year's high school graduates have not studied the fundamentals of Darwinism during their high school studies, but only studied human anatomy and physiology. If only human anatomy and physiology were tested, it would not meet the requirements of higher agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and veterinary colleges. Therefore, the content of this year's biology examination syllabus includes human anatomy and physiology from high school and zoology and botany from junior high school. Candidates are required to focus on reviewing the content listed in the biology examination syllabus.

    Question: This year's college entrance examination is still divided into three categories. Why is the method of cross-category application no longer implemented?

    Answer: College entrance examinations are still divided into three categories this year, according to the different nature of each department (major) and the different requirements of teaching. In 1958, various regions implemented a method that allowed candidates to apply across categories, but according to feedback from various regions, the number of people participating in cross-category applications was very small last year, and the actual significance was not great; moreover, candidates participating in cross-category applications had to take examinations in different subjects between the two categories, which also increased the burden of studying and preparing for the examination for these candidates. Therefore, the method of cross-category application will no longer be implemented this year. Candidates can concentrate on preparing for any type of school and department (major) with the same examination subjects according to their wishes.

    Question: Do on-the-job personnel applying for college have to go through the procedures for resignation or leaving their job in advance?

    Answer: On-the-job personnel who wish to apply for college do not need to go through the procedures for resignation or leaving their job in advance. As long as they have the approval of their work unit and a letter of introduction from their work unit, they can apply. After passing the examination and being admitted, they can then go through the procedures for leaving their job to study.

    关于高等学校招生问题
    教育部人民来信来访办公室
    最近，有一些准备报考高等学校的青年来信，询问有关今年高等学校招生的一些具体问题。现在综合答复如下。
    问：已经报考单独招生学校的考生，能否再报考统一招生的学校？
    答：已经报考单独招生的学校的考生，只要是考试时间不冲突，也可以报考统一招生的学校，考生如因到外省、市、自治区报考单独招生的学校，来不及赶回原属考区报考统一招生的学校时，凭单独招生学校的报考证明，可以向当时所在地的招生机构申请报考，但只限于报考在原属省、市、自治区有招生任务的学校和系科（专业）。
    为避免重复录取，保证各类学校的招生计划顺利完成，已被单独招生的学校录取的新生，不能再报考统一招生的学校，已经报考了的也不再录取；如果有的单独招生的学校，在统一招生的学校考试以后进行招生，同样，已被统一招生的学校录取的新生，也不能再报考单独招生的学校，报考了的也不再录取。
    问：考生因具有某种专业基础或特长以及有其他特殊原因的，能否到外省、市、自治区报考？
    答：高等学校招生应当贯彻就地取材的原则。但是，由于目前考生的地区分布和高等学校招生任务之间还不平衡，为了调剂新生的数量和质量，保证完成各类高等学校的招生计划，对各学校招生的地区范围，已经作了统一安排。因此，考生还是应当就地报考在当地招生的学校。如果考生确因具有某种专业基础或特长，在当地没有这种学校或系科（专业）招生，以及有其他特殊原因而必须到外省、市、自治区报考时，须经当地招生机构同意，并发给允许到外省、市、自治区报考介绍信件，才能到外省、市、自治区申请报考。
    问：今年高等学校招生报考医、农、林、体育学科的考生，为什么不考试达尔文主义基础，而改考生物？
    答：根据普通中学的教学计划规定，今年的高中毕业生在高中学习阶段，没有学过达尔文主义基础，只学过人体解剖生理学。如果只考人体解剖生理学，则又不能适应高等农、林、畜牧、兽医院校的要求。因此，今年编订的生物考试大纲的内容，包括了高中的人体解剖生理学和初中的动物学、植物学三部分。要求考生参照生物考试大纲所列的内容抓紧复习。
    问：今年高等学校招生仍分三类考试，为什么不再实行跨类报考的办法？
    答：高等学校招生按照各系科（专业）的不同性质和教学上的不同要求，今年仍分三类考试。1958年，各地曾实行过允许考生跨类报考的办法，但根据各地的反映，去年参加跨类报考的人数很少，实际意义不大；而且参加跨类报考的考生，还必须参加所跨两类之间不同科目的考试，因而也增加了这部分考生温课备考的负担。因此，今年不再实行跨类报考的办法。考生可以根据自己的志愿，专心准备报考任何一类考试科目相同的学校和系科（专业）。
    问：在职人员报考高等学校，是否要先行办理退职或离职？
    答：志愿报考高等学校的在职人员，不必事先办理退职或离职。只要经过所在工作单位批准，持有所在工作单位的介绍信件，就可以申请报考。考试录取后，再办理离职学习的手续。
