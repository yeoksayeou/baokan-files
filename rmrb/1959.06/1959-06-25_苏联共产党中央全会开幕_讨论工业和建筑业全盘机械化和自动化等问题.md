Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 24th: According to TASS, Moscow, June 24th, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, presided over by the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Khrushchev, opened in Moscow today.

This plenary session will discuss the work of Party organizations, Soviet organizations, and national economic committees in implementing the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on accelerating technological innovation in industry and construction, namely, implementing the overall mechanization and automation of production in industry and construction, and using new technologies to further expand industrial production and construction, improve product quality, and reduce costs.

The plenary session will hear reports from the national economic committees of the Moscow City, Leningrad, Stalino, Sverdlovsk (Ural), and Dnepropetrovsk national economic administrative regions.

The plenary session will hear a report from the State Chemistry Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on the implementation of the resolution of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee on May 7, 1958, on accelerating the development of the chemical industry, especially the accelerated development of synthetic materials production, and will also discuss a report on measures for the further development of the Soviet textile industry.

The Moscow City National Economic Committee Chairman Petukhov, Leningrad National Economic Committee Chairman Afanasyev, Stalino National Economic Committee Chairman Dyadyk, and Sverdlovsk National Economic Committee Chairman Stepanov made reports at the first meeting of this Central Committee plenary session.

Leaders of Party organizations of various republics, border regions, states, and large industrial cities, chairmen of the Council of Ministers of various republics, leaders of enterprises, construction sites, and various national economic committees, heads of central ministries and departments, scientists, designers, production innovators, etc., were invited to participate in the work of the plenary session.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 24th: Newspapers here today all published editorials on the convening of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. The editorials unanimously pointed out that the convening of this plenary session is of great significance for completing the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule and further rapidly developing the Soviet national economy.

The "Pravda" pointed out in its editorial that this plenary session will discuss specific measures to complete the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, that is, how to further develop the overall mechanization and automation of production in industry and construction, expand the production equipment of existing industrial enterprises, replace outdated machines, improve product quality, and reduce production costs.

The editorial pointed out that the significance of the Soviet Union's implementation of the overall mechanization and automation of production processes is fundamentally different from that of capitalist countries. The Soviet Union's adoption of new machines and the realization of overall mechanization and automation in production is to reduce workers' labor, increase productivity, and give workers more time to study, rest, and engage in cultural activities, while the adoption of new technologies in production in capitalist countries means the intensification of exploitation of workers and the increase in unemployed workers.

The editorial then said: The Soviet people are welcoming the Central Plenary Session with great enthusiasm. In these days, from border to border, there is a vigorous creative production enthusiasm of the working masses. This once again proves that all the Soviet people actively support the policies of the CPSU Central Committee.

The editorial called on mobilizing all forces to realize technological reform in all national economic sectors and strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The "Izvestia" published an editorial saying: The June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee will play a huge role in the concrete realization of the resolutions of the 21st Congress. This plenary session will open a new page in the Soviet Union's technological reform.

The editorial also said: Realizing the overall mechanization and automation of the production process and modernizing the production of existing enterprises is the primary task in the Soviet Union's current industrial production. Achieving this task will enable us to obtain more new industrial and agricultural machinery and equipment, thereby improving product quality, reducing the labor of workers and collective farmers, and greatly increasing labor productivity.

The "Labor News" editorial said: The Soviet trade union organization also actively participated in leading the movement of technological reform of production. At present, the trade union organization has widely organized the workers to discuss technological innovation in production, mobilize the masses to put forward creative suggestions, and, together with the workers, study more rational and specific methods of overall mechanization and automation of the production process.

The editorial of "Soviet Russia News" pointed out: The task of realizing the overall mechanization and automation stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan is not only of economic significance, but also of great social significance. Automation fundamentally changes human labor, improves workers' cultural and technical level, and creates conditions for eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor.

    苏联共产党中央全会开幕
    讨论工业和建筑业全盘机械化和自动化等问题
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议在苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫主持下于今天在莫斯科开幕。
    这次全会将讨论党组织、苏维埃组织和国民经济委员会在执行苏共第二十一次代表大会关于加速工业和建筑业中的技术革新的决议方面的工作问题，即在工业和建筑业中实行全盘机械化和生产自动化，运用新技术以进一步扩大工业生产和工业建设，提高产品质量和降低成本等问题。
    全会将听取莫斯科市、列宁格勒、斯大林诺、斯维德洛夫斯克（乌拉尔）和第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克等国民经济行政区的国民经济委员会的报告。
    全会将听取苏联部长会议国家化学委员会就1958年5月7日苏共中央全会关于加速发展化学工业、特别是加速发展合成材料生产的决议的执行情况所作的报告，同时还将讨论关于进一步发展苏联纺织工业的措施的报告。
    在这次中央全会第一次会议上作报告的有莫斯科市国民经济委员会主席佩图霍夫、列宁格勒国民经济委员会主席阿法纳西耶夫、斯大林诺国民经济委员会主席佳迪克和斯维德洛夫斯克国民经济委员会主席斯捷潘诺夫。
    各共和国、边疆区、州及大工业城市党组织的领导人，各共和国部长会议主席，企业、建筑工地和各国民经济委员会的领导人，中央各部和主管部门的负责人、科学家、设计师、生产革新者等都应邀参加全会的工作。
    新华社莫斯科24日电　此间各报今天都就苏共中央六月全会的召开发表社论。社论一致指出，这次全会的召开对提前完成七年计划，进一步迅速发展苏联国民经济具有重大意义。
    “真理报”在社论中指出，这次全会将讨论完成苏共第二十一次代表大会决议的具体措施问题，即讨论如何进一步发展工业、建筑业中的生产全盘机械化和自动化，扩充现有工业企业的生产设备，更换陈旧的机器，提高产品质量，降低生产成本等问题。
    社论指出，苏联实行生产过程全盘机械化、自动化的意义与资本主义国家有原则上的不同。苏联在生产中采用新机器，实现全盘机械化和自动化为了减轻工人劳动，提高生产率，使工人有更多的时间来学习、休息和进行文化活动，而资本主义国家在生产中采用新技术则意味着对工人剥削的加剧和失业工人的增加。
    社论接着说：苏联人民正以巨大热情迎接中央全会。在这些日子里，从边疆到边疆，到处呈现着劳动群众蓬勃的创造性的生产热情。这又一次证明苏联全体人民积极拥护苏共中央的政策。
    社论号召动员全部力量，在一切国民经济部门中实现技术改革，争取提前完成七年计划。
    “消息报”发表社论说：苏共中央6月全会将在具体实现第二十一次代表大会的决议方面起巨大的作用。这次全会将打开苏联技术改革的新的一页。
    社论还说：实现生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，使现有企业的生产现代化，这是苏联目前工业生产中的首要任务。实现这个任务就能使我们获得更多的新的工业和农业机器设备，从而改善产品质量，减轻工人、集体农民们的劳动，并大大地提高劳动生产率。
    “劳动报”的社论说：苏联工会组织也积极参加了领导生产技术改革运动。目前工会组织广泛地组织了工人群众进行生产技术革新讨论，发动群众提出创造性的建议，并和工人们一起，研究生产过程全盘机械化和自动化的更合理的具体方法。
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”的社论指出：实现七年计划所规定的全盘机械化和自动化的任务不仅有经济意义，而且有巨大的社会意义。自动化从根本上改变了人的劳动，提高工人文化技术水平，为消除脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别创造条件。
