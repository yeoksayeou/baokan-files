    Garlic Oil Emulsion
    The Yaoxin Management Area Tongxing Pesticide Factory of the Tanqiao People's Commune in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, created "Garlic Oil Emulsion," which is very effective in controlling cotton aphids and spider mites, with a kill rate of 95% to 100%.
    Raw materials and formula: Three catties of whole garlic plants, five liang of kerosene, ten liang of 6% wettable BHC powder, and four and a half catties of clear water.
    Production method: ① Chop and crush the garlic, add three catties of clear water to every three catties of garlic, and soak for at least two hours. You can extract four catties of garlic juice. Then, use the residue and add one and a half catties of clear water, continue to soak and squeeze, and you can obtain another one and a half catties of garlic juice. ② According to the formula ratio, add the kerosene to the 6% BHC powder, stir thoroughly to form a paste, then pour it into the garlic juice, stirring while pouring, to form a milky suspension.
    How to use: Spray by diluting each catty of "Garlic Oil Emulsion" with 200 times the amount of water.
    Tea-Arsenic Mixture
    The pesticide factory of the Matian People's Commune in Yongxing County, Hunan Province, recently successfully trial-produced tea-arsenic mixture pesticide, which is very effective, especially against rice planthoppers, killing them on contact. Tea-arsenic mixture is made by mixing 100 catties of tea seed cake water with six liang of arsenic and one catty of camphor oil. When using, dilute one catty of the mixture with 60 to 70 catties of clear water (using less water will harm crops), and spray directly on the roots of the seedlings. The kill rate is over 80%.
