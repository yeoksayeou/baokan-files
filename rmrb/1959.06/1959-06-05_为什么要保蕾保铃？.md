Why Protect Cotton Buds and Bolls?

In China's major cotton-producing areas, cotton plants begin to bud in June and enter the boll-forming period in July. This is a crucial time for protecting the buds and bolls.

Although China's cotton production has seen bumper harvests in recent years, the phenomenon of bud and boll shedding remains serious. In 1958, the shedding rate of buds and bolls in general cotton fields decreased by about 10% compared to previous years, but shedding still exceeded 60%. In some cotton fields, the shedding rate was even higher. If we can reduce the shedding of cotton buds and bolls, we can increase cotton production even more. Some people have calculated that the most widely planted variety, Dai Zi Cotton No. 15, has 5,000 plants per mu, with each plant producing 50 buds. If the bud and boll shedding rate is 80%, then each plant will only develop ten bolls. Assuming that one jin of seed cotton contains an average of 125 bolls, then each mu can produce 400 jin of seed cotton. If the shedding rate can be reduced to 40%, and the number of bolls per plant increases to 30, then each mu can produce 1,200 jin of seed cotton, increasing the yield by two times. If the shedding rate is further reduced to 10%, then each plant will develop 45 bolls, and the yield of seed cotton per mu can reach 1,800 jin, an increase of three and a half times compared to a shedding rate of 80%. From this, it can be seen that protecting buds and bolls and reducing shedding is the most critical issue for achieving high and abundant cotton yields.

### 为什么要保蕾保铃？

    为什么要保蕾保铃？
    我国主要棉产区到了6月，棉花就开始现蕾，七月进入花铃期，这是保蕾保铃的重要时期。
    我国棉花生产虽然连年获得丰收，但蕾铃脱落现象仍然严重。1958年一般棉田的蕾铃脱落率比往年约降低10％，但脱落仍在60％以上，有些棉田，脱落率还要高。如果我们能使棉蕾棉铃少脱落，就可以更多的增产棉花。有人计算过，目前种植最多的岱字棉十五号品种，每亩种植五千株，每株现蕾五十个，如蕾铃脱落率为80％，则每株成铃数只有十个。每斤籽棉平均以一百二十五个铃计，则每亩可产籽棉四百斤。如脱落率能降低到40％，每株成铃数提到三十个，则每亩可产籽棉一千二百斤，产量可以提高二倍。如再将脱落率压低到10％，则每株成铃四十五个，每亩籽棉产量可达一千八百斤，产量较脱落80％的提高三倍半。由此可见，保蕾铃减少脱落是棉花获得高额丰产最关键性问题。
