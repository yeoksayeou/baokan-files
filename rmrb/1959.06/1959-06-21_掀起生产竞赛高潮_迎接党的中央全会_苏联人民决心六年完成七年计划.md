    Launch a Production Emulation Upsurge to Welcome the Party Central Committee Plenum
    Soviet People Determined to Complete the Seven-Year Plan in Six Years
    (Our Dispatch) The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will convene a plenary session on the 24th to summarize the implementation of the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on industry and construction, and to discuss the overall mechanization and automation of industry, the further expansion of industrial and construction production, and the further development of the chemical industry. On the eve of the plenary session, the Soviet working people launched a broad mass emulation movement to fulfill production plans ahead of schedule. This is a new production upsurge inspired by the Seven-Year Plan and launched by the Soviet people to welcome the plenary session of their Party Central Committee.
    The Sverdlovsk Economic Region, one of the strongholds of Soviet heavy industry, took the lead in proposing to complete the Seven-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule in terms of production levels. They had completed the May plan five days ahead of schedule and ensured the completion of the first half-year plan before the opening of the Central Committee Plenum. The main measures they are taking to complete the Seven-Year Plan in six years are: under the leadership of the Party organization, to mobilize enthusiasm and creativity to use funds more effectively, to make fuller use of existing production capacity and production sites, to adopt new technologies, to renew equipment, and to tap all the potential for completing the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. That is to say, the working people of the Sverdlovsk Economic Region proudly guarantee to complete the Seven-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule without expanding the original investment plan, which is worthy of special attention. For example, the "Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant" in this economic region decided not to add a new steel casting workshop, but to expand production capacity three to four years ahead of schedule by modifying existing workshops and adopting advanced welding and casting structures. In addition, by renewing equipment and making better use of equipment, the designed capacity of the entire plant to produce machinery will be increased by 40%.
    The initiative of the working people of the Sverdlovsk Economic Region was praised by the Central Committee of the CPSU. On June 10, the Central Committee of the CPSU made a special decision on this, calling on Party committees at all levels and National Economic Councils in various economic regions to widely organize workers to discuss this initiative in order to formulate measures to better complete the Seven-Year Plan based on their own capabilities.
    Subsequently, workers in many enterprises throughout the Soviet Union responded enthusiastically, tapping potential and making arrangements to complete the Seven-Year Plan one or even two years ahead of schedule. The employees of seven lathe manufacturing plants such as the "Red Proletarian" and three tool manufacturing plants such as "Caliber" in the Moscow (City) Economic Region guarantee that by 1965 they will produce 56% more products than the tasks predetermined by the Seven-Year Plan. The employees of the Moscow Tire Factory guarantee to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years according to production levels. The activist conference of the Leningrad Economic Region, representing the workers of the entire region, challenged the Sverdlovsk Economic Region and the Moscow (City) Economic Region to complete the Seven-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule in terms of labor productivity. The employees of the Novogorky Oil Refinery in Gorky City are determined to increase oil refining volume to the end-of-1965 target by 1963. The employees of the Petrovsky Steel Plant in Dnepropetrovsk used their brains and devised some concrete measures to reach the 1965 level in the production of iron, steel, and steel products two years ahead of schedule. The workers of the South Caucasus Iron and Steel Plant and the Karaganda Coal Mine have all formulated measures to complete the Seven-Year Plan in six years. (Attached picture)

    掀起生产竞赛高潮　迎接党的中央全会
    苏联人民决心六年完成七年计划
    本报讯　苏联共产党中央委员会即将于24日召开全体会议，总结苏共第二十一次代表大会关于工业和建筑业决议的执行情况，讨论工业全盘机械化、自动化，工业和建筑业生产的进一步扩大，化学工业的进一步发展等问题。在全会开幕前夕，苏联劳动人民展开了一个规模广阔的提前完成生产计划的群众性竞赛。这是为执行七年计划所鼓舞的苏联人民，为迎接自己党中央全会所掀起的新的生产高潮。
    作为苏联重工业堡垒之一的斯维德洛夫经济区，它的工业和建筑业劳动者首先倡议按生产水平提前一年完成七年计划。他们曾经提前五天完成了5月份计划，并且保证在中央全会开幕之前完成上半年计划。他们争取六年完成七年计划的主要措施是：在党组织的领导下，鼓起干劲和创造精神来更有效地使用资金，更充分地利用现有的生产能力和生产场所，采用新技术，更新设备，和挖掘提前完成七年计划的一切潜力。这就是说，斯维德洛夫经济区劳动者自豪地保证，在不扩大原计划的投资的情况下，提前一年完成七年计划，这是值得特别重视的。例如，这个经济区的“乌拉尔重型机器制造厂”，决定不添建新的铸钢车间，而用改修现有车间和采用先进的熔接和铸造结构的办法，提前三、四年扩大生产能力，再加上更新设备和更好地使用设备的办法，将把原设计的全厂出产机器的能力提高40％。
    斯维德洛夫经济区劳动者的倡议，受到苏共中央的赞许。苏共中央6月10日为此作出了专门的决定，号召各级党委和各经济区国民经济委员会广泛地组织劳动者讨论这个倡议，以便根据自己的可能订出更好地完成七年计划的措施。
    接着，苏联各地许多企业的劳动者群起响应，纷纷挖掘潜力，作出了提前一年甚至两年完成七年计划的部署。莫斯科（市）经济区的“红色无产者”等七个车床制造厂和“卡里伯”等三个工具制造厂的职工，保证到1965年将比七年计划预定的任务多生产56％的产品。莫斯科轮胎制造厂的职工保证按生产水平在五年内完成七年计划。列宁格勒经济区的积极分子会议，代表全区劳动者，向斯维德洛夫经济区和莫斯科（市）经济区提出按劳动生产率水平提前一年完成七年计划的挑战。高尔基城的诺沃高尔基炼油厂职工决心使石油提炼量在1963年就达到1965年底的指标。第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克的彼得罗夫斯基钢铁厂职工，动脑筋，想办法，订出了一些具体措施，使得在生产铁、钢和钢材方面能够提前两年达到1965年的水平。南高加索钢铁厂以及卡拉甘达煤矿的劳动者，都订出了在六年内完成七年计划的措施。（附图片）
