Hangzhou, June 5th (Reported by our newspaper) – In the past month, various regions of Zhejiang Province have held industrial five-level cadre meetings. Through these meetings, democracy has been fully promoted, problems existing in industrial production and enterprise management have been exposed, the relationship between upper and lower levels has become closer, and the production enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly enhanced.

One-sided pursuit of output value was a common problem in Zhejiang Province during the first quarter of the year. At the recent five-level cadre meetings held in various places, workers raised sharp criticisms. Subsequently, many enterprises examined this issue and proposed concrete measures to fully implement the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results," which led to improvements in production.

At the five-level cadre meetings, grassroots cadres and worker representatives criticized the lack of implementation in planning management during the previous period. After the meetings, many factories and mines adopted a "two-up, two-down" method when formulating plans, based on the actual conditions of the enterprise. This involves leaders conducting preliminary investigations and proposing plans, disclosing the plans to the masses, and mobilizing the masses for discussion; then, the leaders concentrate on revising the plans before issuing them for implementation. Facts have proven that factories and mines that have adopted this method have created plans that are both reliable and implementable, with workers reflecting, "We have a clear understanding, and we know what we're doing." For example, in early May, the Shaoxing Xianheng Food Factory, based on a summary and evaluation, adopted this method to discuss and formulate the May production plan. The workers were in high spirits, saying, "We participated in making the plan ourselves, and we must guarantee its completion." Each team consciously formulated guarantee conditions.

After the five-level cadre meetings, various regions generally paid attention to combining hard work, practical work, and skillful work in the production increase and economy campaign. They adopted a "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians, focusing on key production issues to launch technical innovation and technical revolution, improve tools and equipment, improve operating methods, improve product design, and improve labor organization. This significantly increased labor productivity, output, and quality, while greatly reducing raw material consumption and costs. To expand and consolidate the achievements of the technical revolution and technical innovation, many enterprises not only mobilized the masses to innovate technically but also summarized and promoted effective advanced experiences from home and abroad. In order to quickly reverse the situation where synthetic caffeine production consistently failed to meet the plan each month, the Zhejiang Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory's Party committee held worker forums to mobilize everyone to come up with solutions, while also promoting the advanced experience of the Hunan Pharmaceutical Factory, changing the disconnection between upper and lower processes, which greatly increased the output of synthetic caffeine.

Through this meeting, the leadership style of industrial leading cadres at all levels has also greatly improved. The Hangzhou Automobile Manufacturing Factory's engine workshop was tasked with producing 150 diesel engines in May. Initially, some workshop cadres, seeing that this task was 47% higher than in April, feared they couldn't handle it. After discovering this situation, the factory Party committee immediately helped the workshop cadres mobilize the masses to find the key and come up with solutions. After worker discussions, experienced workers Zhu Songquan, Gu Miaofu, and others proposed improving the process, improving operating methods, and appropriately adjusting labor organization. After implementing these suggestions, efficiency generally improved. The task of producing 150 diesel engines in May has already been completed. The transformation of leadership style is also reflected in the fact that many leading cadres are participating in production and leading production as ordinary laborers, which has greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of the masses. Leading cadres of the Wenzhou Xishan Ceramics Factory worked with workers to develop experimental kilns, solving key production problems, and the qualified rate of green bricks rose from 42.6% in April to 75.97%.

Many factory and mine leaders, through the five-level cadre meetings, further clarified the importance of grasping both production and livelihood, and generally conducted inspections and arrangements for the masses' lives and welfare. Many enterprises have also properly arranged workers' spare-time cultural learning and recreational activities time, which workers are very satisfied with. (Zheng Zhibiao)

    五级干部会好处无穷
    浙江省工矿企业上下通气管理加强生产提高
    本报杭州5日电浙江省各地于最近一个月来，举行了工业方面的五级干部会议。通过五级干部会，充分发扬了民主，揭露了工业生产和企业管理方面存在的问题，使上下之间的关系更为密切，群众的生产热情更加高涨。
    片面追求产值，曾经是浙江省一季度内普遍存在的问题。这次，在各地召开的五级干部会上，职工们提出了尖锐的批评。接着，许多企业检查了这个问题，并提出了全面贯彻多快好省这一方针的具体措施，因而生产有了起色。
    在五级干部会上，基层干部和职工代表对前一时期计划管理方面存在的不落实现象提出了批评。会后，许多厂矿企业在制订计划时，都根据企业实际情况，采取了“二上二下”的方法，即领导摸底，提出方案，向群众交底，发动群众讨论；再由领导集中修改，然后下达执行。事实证明：凡是这样做的厂矿，计划都做到了既可靠又落实，工人反映：“心中有数，干活有底了。”例如绍兴咸亨食品厂，5月初在进行总结评比的基础上，采取这个方法讨论和制订了5月份的生产计划，工人们情绪很高，他们说：“我们自己参加订的计划，一定要保证完成。”各小组都自觉地制订了保证条件。
    五级干部会以后，各地在增产节约运动中一般都注意把苦干、实干和巧干结合了起来，采取领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的方法，针对生产关键大闹技术革新和技术革命，改进工具设备，改进操作方法，改进产品设计，改善劳动组织，从而使劳动生产率、产量质量有了显著提高，原料材料消耗量和成本大大下降。为了扩大和巩固技术革命和技术革新的成果，许多企业一边发动群众革新技术，一边总结和推广国内外行之有效的先进经验。浙江民生药厂为了迅速扭转合成咖啡因月月完不成计划的局面，厂党委一边召开工人座谈会，发动大家想办法，一边推广了湖南制药厂的先进经验，改变了上下工序脱节的情况，使合成咖啡因的产量大大提高。
    通过这次会议，各级工业领导干部的领导作风也有了很大的改进。杭州汽车制造厂发动机车间5月份生产一百五十台柴油机。开始，部分车间干部看到这个任务比4月份增加47％，怕吃不消。厂党委发现这一情况后，立即帮助车间干部发动群众找关键，想办法。经过工人讨论，老师傅朱松泉、顾妙福等提出了改进工艺、改进操作方法和适当调整劳动组织等建议，实现后，效率普遍提高。5月份一百五十台柴油机的任务已经完成。领导作风的转变，还表现在许多领导干部以普通劳动者的身份参加生产领导生产，大大鼓舞了群众的生产积极性。温州西山陶瓷厂领导干部与工人一起搞试验炉，解决了生产关键问题，青砖正品率由4月份的42.6％上升为75.97％。
    许多厂矿企业的领导人，通过五级干部会议进一步明确了一手抓生产，一手抓生活的重要性，普遍对群众生活福利问题进行了检查和安排。不少企业还妥善安排了职工业余文化学习和文娱活动时间，工人们很满意。  （郑志标）
