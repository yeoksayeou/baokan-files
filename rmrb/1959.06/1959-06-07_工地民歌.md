    Construction Site Folk Song
    Shouldering our hoes, we sing a song,
    Over mountains and ridges, we divert the Tao River;
    The Tao River leads to the Dongzhi Plateau,
    Rowing boats, we ascend to the Milky Way.
    What was Yu the Great's flood control?
    Three times he passed his home without entering;
    Today's laborers have great perseverance,
    Determined to bring water back home.
    Water has a source, trees have roots,
    All ethnic groups are of one heart;
    Joining forces to split the mountain and divert the Tao River,
    Hand in hand, we leap forward.

    工地民歌
    扛起镢头唱起歌，
    翻山越岭引洮河；
    洮河引上董志塬，
    摇上船儿上银河。
    大禹治水算个啥，
    三次过门没回家；
    民工今天毅力大，
    坚决带水回到家。
    水有源头树有根，
    各族人民一条心；
    合力劈山引洮河，
    手拉手儿大跃进。
