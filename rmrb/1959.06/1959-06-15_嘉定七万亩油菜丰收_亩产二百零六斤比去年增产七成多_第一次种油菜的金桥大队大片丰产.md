Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 14th: Jiading County, Shanghai, has achieved a bumper harvest of rapeseed. The 78,685 mu of rapeseed that has already been harvested and threshed throughout the county has an average yield of 206 jin and 9 liang of dry rapeseed per mu, an increase of 72.3% compared to last year.

During the entire process of rapeseed production, the people's communes in Jiading County conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and changed some backward farming systems. Originally, the habit of planting rapeseed here was shallow plowing and no application of base fertilizer. Before sowing last autumn, all rapeseed fields were deeply plowed to more than eight cun; generally, about 30 dan of base fertilizer (pig and sheep manure) was applied per mu. When sowing, all high-yielding, cold-resistant, and disease-resistant fine variety "Victory" rapeseed seeds were selected; the transplanting time was also advanced by about 15 days compared to previous years. In the past, rapeseed was sparsely planted, generally about 4,000 plants per mu. Last autumn, reasonable close planting was implemented, and the number of plants per mu was increased by about 100%. After transplanting, field management was also effectively carried out. For example, topdressing was generally only done twice in previous years, and in the later stage, the fertilizer was insufficient, which affected bolting and pod formation. Last winter and this spring, rapeseed was generally topdressed three times, and in some cases four or five times, to meet the needs of rapeseed for fertilizer at various stages such as germination, bolting, and pod formation. The work of ditching, weeding, and pest control in rapeseed fields was also closely monitored, and basically, there was no water accumulation, no weeds, and no pests and diseases in the fields.

When the good news of the rapeseed harvest spread, people were overjoyed and jubilant. Commune members sang, "The east is red, the people's commune is infinitely powerful; the yield of rapeseed per mu is hundreds of jin, and the good news of the rapeseed harvest is spreading; the leadership of the Party is really good, the 'Eight-Character Charter' is a treasure; go all out and work hard, and have a good harvest every year."

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 14th: Jinqiao Brigade of Yangjing Commune in Pudong County, Shanghai, has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of rapeseed. Of the 5,800 mu of rapeseed, 2,003 mu, 4 fen, 2 li, and 8 hao that have already been threshed have yielded a total of 508,956 jin and 14 liang of dry rapeseed, with an average yield of over 254 jin per mu. Among them, 52 mu and 3 fen have an average yield of 371 jin and 2 liang per mu.

The rapeseed harvest of this brigade is the result of commune members overcoming various natural disasters from sowing to harvesting. When the seedlings had just emerged, they encountered more than a month without rain, and the rapeseed seedlings turned yellow. The entire team mobilized waterwheels, ox carts, hand-operated water wheels, dippers, and water pumps to fight the drought. In January of this year, the temperature in Shanghai dropped to minus eight degrees Celsius. Commune members made preparations for frost prevention before the cold wave arrived, covering the rapeseed fields with grass or building windbreaks to avoid losses.

This year is the first time that Pudong County has planted rapeseed, and the harvest also relied on learning cultivation experience from neighboring counties. When sowing, the county party committee invited old farmers from Shanghai County to conduct demonstrative sowing in six mu of rapeseed fields and organized everyone to learn. At harvest time, old farmers from Nanhui County were invited to identify the maturity of the rapeseed, and on-site meetings were held to promote it. They used the method of inviting farmers from neighboring counties to guide or sending personnel to neighboring counties to learn, and in every link of sowing, seedling cultivation, transplanting, survival, bolting, flowering, and harvesting, they learned advanced experience from other places.

After achieving a bumper harvest, the commune members happily busied themselves harvesting rapeseed and selling good rapeseed to the state. As of June 11, the purchasing station had purchased 461,500 jin of rapeseed.

### 嘉定七万亩油菜丰收  亩产二百零六斤比去年增产七成多  第一次种油菜的金桥大队大片丰产

    嘉定七万亩油菜丰收
    亩产二百零六斤比去年增产七成多
    第一次种油菜的金桥大队大片丰产
    新华社上海14日电　上海市嘉定县油菜大丰收。全县已经收割脱粒的七万八千六百八十五亩油菜，平均亩产干菜籽二百零六斤九两，比去年增产72.3％。
    嘉定县各人民公社在油菜生产的整个过程中，认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，改变了某些落后的耕作制度。这里原来种油菜习惯是浅耕和不施基肥。去年秋天播种前，油菜地全部深耕八寸以上；一般每亩施基肥（猪羊圈肥）三十担左右。播种时，全部选用了高产、耐寒、抗病力较强的良种“胜利”油菜种籽；移栽时间也比往年提早约十五天。过去油菜是稀植的，一般每亩约四千棵，去秋实行了合理密植，每亩株数比过去增加了一倍左右。移栽后，又切实作好了田间管理。如追肥，历年一般只追二次，到后期就因肥力不足，影响抽苔结荚。去冬今春，油菜普遍追肥三次，多的四、五次，满足了油菜在发棵、抽苔、结荚等各个阶段对肥料的需要。对油菜田的开沟、除草、治虫等工作也抓得较紧，基本上做到了田间无积水、无杂草、无病虫害。
    当油菜丰收的喜讯传出以后，人们欢欣鼓舞，喜气洋洋。社员们歌唱说：“东方日出满天红，人民公社力无穷；亩产菜籽双百斤，油菜丰收传捷报；党的领导实在好，‘八字宪法’是个宝；鼓足干劲加油干，年年丰收熟熟好”。
    新华社上海14日电　上海市浦东县洋泾公社金桥大队获得油菜大面积丰收。五千八百亩油菜中已经脱粒的二千零三亩四分二厘八，共收干菜籽五十万八千九百五十六斤十四两，平均亩产二百五十四斤强。其中五十二亩三分，平均亩产三百七十一斤二两。
    这个大队油菜丰收，是社员们从下种到收割战胜了各种自然灾害的结果。当小苗出土不久，就遇到一个多月没有下透雨，油菜苗发生枯黄现象，全队动员水车、牛车、摇车、戽斗、抽水机进行抗旱。今年1月份，上海气温曾降到零下八度，社员早在寒流来临之前作了防冻准备，油菜田用草复盖或搭防风障等，避免损失。
    浦东县今年是第一次种植油菜，取得丰收，也依靠了向邻县学习栽培经验。下种时，县委请来上海县老农在六亩油菜田进行示范性播种，组织大家学习。收割时，又请南汇县老农鉴定油菜成熟程度，召开现场会议加以推广。他们用请邻县农民前来指导或派出人员向邻县学习的办法，在播种、育秧、移栽、活棵、抽苔、开花、收割等每一个环节上，都学习了外地的先进经验。
    获得大丰收以后，社员们满怀喜悦地一面忙着收割油菜，一面把好菜籽卖给国家。到6月11日止，收购站已收购了菜籽四十六万一千五百斤。
