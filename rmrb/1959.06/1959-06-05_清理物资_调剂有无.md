    Unearthing the potential of material resources, making the most reasonable use of limited materials, and ensuring the needs of production and construction is an important task in the current increase production and practice economy movement. According to the experience of some provinces and cities, it is an effective measure to give full play to the potential of materials to clear stockpiled and stagnant materials in a planned way under leadership, communicate supply and demand, and adjust surpluses and shortages. This practice needs to be universally promoted in various places.
    At present, the work of clearing materials in Gansu, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shanghai, Chongqing and other provinces and cities has come to a preliminary conclusion, and other places are actively carrying out this work. The industrial, transportation, financial and trade, and cultural and educational departments at the provincial level in Gansu cleared various types of steel from warehouses, equivalent to more than half of the steel allocated to Gansu by the state in 1958; more than 20 kinds of machinery such as blowers and generators are almost equal to one time the amount transferred from other places by Gansu local enterprises in 1958. In the process of clearing materials, Harbin Boiler Factory cleared more than 1,300 tons of steel unsuitable for the factory and supported more than 200 brother factories. All workshops and groups in this factory cleared materials. One group cleared a large number of valve bodies and valve covers from the work site in two days, which can be reassembled into 1,500 sets of good valves. (It should be noted here that the above-mentioned workshops and groups need to and should always maintain a certain amount of spare parts and components according to the needs of the production cycle. The "cleared out" here only means that they should make more reasonable use of them.) In the process of clearing materials, the Yixian Commercial Bureau of Hebei Province found that the commodities that could not be sold locally from two management departments and a people's commune supply and marketing cooperative included: 11,500 pieces of high-grade cold storage equipment lightweight glass, two-color rotary printing presses, electric furnaces, etc.; materials with excessive inventory included: more than 20,000 kilograms of asbestos board purchased last year, 1,156 radios, 130,000 light bulbs, and more than 6,300 fluorescent tubes. Eighty water pumps purchased last year were stockpiled and could not be sold due to lack of bottom belt screws. In addition, some people's communes also cleared materials. The Pingle People's Commune in Mengjin County, Henan Province, found a lot of tires, tungsten powder that was not needed, and other electrical materials.
    It can be seen from some of the materials quoted above: First, on the one hand, certain materials are relatively scarce in production and on the market, but on the other hand, a considerable amount of materials exist in many units and cannot play a role. Not only factories have them, commercial departments have them, but also institutions, organizations, schools, and even rural areas have them; not only provincial-level units have them, but also county-level and even commune-level units have them; not only large units have them, but also small units have them; not only raw materials, but also finished products that can be directly put into production or supplied to the market, semi-finished products, and mainframes, which can play a role as long as they are slightly processed or assembled into complete sets of parts. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a lot to be done in clearing materials.
    Second, the arrangement of many materials is unreasonable. A commercial unit in a county buys 130,000 light bulbs a year, stores more than 10,000 pieces of lightweight glass, etc. When will there be buyers? When will it be sold out? It is not reasonable for a factory producing product A to store raw materials for producing product B! It is absolutely necessary for various units, especially factories and commercial units, to reserve a certain amount of materials, otherwise normal production and normal material exchange cannot be carried out. However, reserves should have limits. One limit is that the quantity should be appropriate; the other limit is that in terms of variety and specifications, materials that are not currently needed for production by the unit and commodities that are difficult to sell locally should not be reserved. Without such limits, it is easy to cause unreasonable material arrangement, make material circulation unsmooth, and create an artificial imbalance between supply and demand. For enterprises, it causes capital backlog, which is even more inconsistent with the principle of economic accounting.
    Third, the clearing of materials and the adjustment of supply and demand must be carried out under leadership, in an organized manner, and in a planned manner. In places where materials have been cleared or are being cleared, organizations for adjusting materials have been established under the leadership of party committees or relevant departments. This is absolutely necessary. Without such an organization, it is difficult to do this work well, not only because it is difficult for various units to understand the varieties and specifications of existing materials and needed materials; at the same time, the cleared materials need to be used in the most urgently needed areas with the fastest and greatest results, and not necessarily in the unit, department, or system. Therefore, when carrying out this work, there must be strong leadership to unify the allocation and use of materials. Of course, to do a good job in this series of work of inventorying and allocating, it is also necessary to fully rely on the enthusiasm of various units and promote a high degree of collaborative spirit and communist style from the perspective of the overall situation.
    It should be pointed out that the reason for the increase in stagnant materials and unqualified products in the above-mentioned warehouses cannot be blamed on the grassroots enterprises and users first. This responsibility should first be borne by the material distribution units. We suggest that in the future, material distribution units must pay attention to allocating and dispatching materials in terms of quantity, quality, variety, and time. It should also be pointed out that clearing warehouses is a good way to solve the problem of mutual communication, learning from each other's strengths, and making up for each other's weaknesses. However, when clearing warehouses, it is necessary to distinguish between clearing stockpiled, stagnant, and surplus materials and equipment and maintaining a reasonable and necessary fixed quota of reserves. The current situation is that there are too many materials that should be cleared, and there is oil and water to be cleared; the reasonable reserves are too small and should be replenished. Therefore, the current urgent task is: clear the former and replenish the latter. Don't grab everything indiscriminately.
    Clearing materials and adjusting the surplus and shortage between units, systems, or regions is undoubtedly a good method. However, in order to fundamentally achieve the rational arrangement and use of materials, it is also necessary to strengthen work in all links of material production and circulation. From the perspective of production units, it is necessary to strictly produce in accordance with the varieties and specifications proposed by the ordering units, ensure quality, and not simply pursue output value and quantity, so as to avoid difficulties in allocation and material backlog. In terms of allocation, it is necessary to compress intermediate links as much as possible, organize long-distance and short-distance transportation forces in a timely manner, and transport them to the ordering units and the market on time, in quantity, in quality, and in variety to meet the needs of production and consumption. The material management personnel of each unit must organize the inventory materials in an orderly manner, prevent damage and deterioration, and report the inventory situation to the leaders regularly so as to arrange production and supply to the market. As for the leaders of enterprise units, they must not only understand and care about the production situation, but also need to care about and master the inventory situation of materials. Some unit leaders lack understanding of inventory materials. They clearly have them in their warehouses, but blindly send people out to purchase or request allocation of materials, which not only wastes manpower, material resources, and financial resources, but also exacerbates inventory backlog. Therefore, leaders must have a clear idea of the inventory of materials in their units. Even if they cannot be familiar with every item, they must at least have a clear understanding of important materials.
    Our country's production and construction are continuing to leap forward. From a general point of view, the raw materials, fuels, and materials that we can produce often cannot meet the actual needs. Of course, the fundamental problem is to increase production. However, at the same time, it is absolutely necessary to make the most reasonable use of limited materials, which is the bounden duty of our socialist builders. Those places and units that have not yet cleared materials need to start clearing them immediately so that stagnant materials can be quickly put into the first line of production.

### 清理物资　调剂有无

    清理物资　调剂有无
    挖掘物质资源的潜力，使有限的物资得到最合理的使用，保证生产建设的需要，这是当前增产节约运动中一项重要的工作。根据部分省市的经验，有领导有计划地清查积压和呆滞物资、沟通有无、调剂余缺，是发挥物资潜力的一项有效措施。这种做法，有必要在各地普遍推行。
    目前，在甘肃、黑龙江、辽宁、上海、重庆等省市，清理物资的工作已初步告一段落，另一些地方正在积极进行。甘肃省一级的工业、交通、财贸以及文教部门，从仓库中清理出的各种钢材，等于1958年国家拨给甘肃的钢材一半还多；鼓风机、发电机等二十多种机械，几乎等于1958年甘肃地方企业从外地调入量的一倍。哈尔滨锅炉厂在清理物资中，清出一千三百多吨本厂不适用的钢材，支援了二百多个兄弟工厂。这个工厂的各个车间、各个小组，都对物资进行了清理。有一个小组在两天内从作业现场清理出大批阀体、阀盖，可以重新装配成好阀门一千五百套。（这里应当说明，上述车间、小组，他们有必要而且应当按生产周期的需要经常保有一定数量的备品、备件的，这里所说“清理出来”只是要他们做更合理的使用而已。）河北省易县商业局在清理物资中，从两个经理部和一个人民公社供销部，查出本地不能销售的商品有：一万一千五百块高级冷仓设备轻质玻璃，双色旋转印刷机，电炉子，等等；库存量过多的物资有：去年购进的二万多斤石棉板，一千一百五十六台收音机，十三万个电灯泡，六千三百多个日光灯管。去年购进的八十台水泵，因为缺少底带螺丝，积存下来，不能销售。另外，有些人民公社也对物资进行了清理。河南省孟津县平乐人民公社就查出不少轮胎和用不着的钨粉以及其他电器材料。
    从上面引述的一些材料中可以看出：第一，一方面在生产上和市场上，某些物资比较缺少，但是另一方面，在许多单位里却有相当数量的物资存在那里不能发挥作用。不仅工厂里有，商业部门有，机关、团体、学校乃至农村，也都有；不仅省一级单位有，县一级以至公社一级也有；不仅大单位有，小单位也有；不仅有原材料，而且有成品，可以直接投入生产或供应市场，有半成品、有主机，只要稍微加工或配件成套，就能发挥作用。因此，可以得出结论说，清理物资，大有可为。
    第二，许多物资的摆布是不合理的。一个县的商业单位，一年买进十三万个电灯泡、储存一万多块轻质玻璃等等，何年才有买主？何月才能卖完？生产甲种产品的工厂，储存生产乙种产品的原材料，这总不能算作合理吧！各个单位，特别是工厂和商业单位，储备一定数量的物资，是完全必要的，否则就不能进行正常生产和正常的物资交流。但是，储备要有限度。一个限度是数量要适当；另一个限度是在品种规格上，不应该储备本单位目前生产不需要的物资和在本地难以销售的商品。没有这样的限度，就容易造成物资摆布不合理，使物资流转不畅，在供应和需要之间出现人为的不平衡。对企业来说，造成资金积压，更是不合经济核算的原则。
    第三，清理物资，调剂有无，必须有领导、有组织、有计划地进行。在已经对物资进行过清理或正在进行清理的地方，都在党委或有关的部门领导下，成立了调剂物资的机构。这是完全必要的。没有这样的组织机构，要做好这一工作是困难的，这不仅因为各个单位难于了解彼此间实存物资和需用物资的品种规格情况；同时，清理出来的物资，需要用到最迫切需要、收效最快最大的方面去，而不一定用在本单位、本部门、本系统，因此，在进行这项工作的时候，必须有强有力的领导，统一调拨使用物资。当然，要做好清点、调拨这一系列的工作，还必须充分依靠各单位的积极性，必须提倡从全局观点出发，发扬高度的协作精神和共产主义风格。
    应当指明：造成上述仓库呆滞物资增多、不合规格品增多的原因，首先不能怪基层企业使用单位，这个责任首先应当由物资分配单位负责。我们建议：今后物资分配单位，必须注意到如量如质如品种如期地分配和调度物资。还应当指明：清理仓库是解决互通有无、取长补短的一个好办法。但在清理仓库的时候，必须把清理积压、呆滞、多余材料设备和保持合理的必要的一定定额的储备区别开来。目前的情况是，该清理的物资是多了，有油水可清；合理的储备是少了，应当补足。所以目前的迫切任务是：清前者，补后者。千万不要眉毛胡子一把抓。
    清理物资，调整各单位、各系统或地区之间的有余和不足，无疑地是一种好方法。但是，为了从根本上作到物资的合理摆布和使用，还需要从物资生产和流转的各个环节加强工作。就生产单位说，需要严格按照订货单位提出的品种规格进行生产，保证质量，不要单纯追求产值和数量，以免造成调拨困难，物资积压。就调拨方面说，要尽量压缩中间环节，及时组织长途和短途运输力量，按时按量按质按品种运到订货单位和市场，以满足生产和消费的需要。各个单位的物资管理人员，必须把库存物资整理得井井有序，防止残损变质，并要经常向领导人员报告库存情况，以便安排生产和供应市场。至于企业单位的领导人员，不仅要了解和关心生产情况，同时也需要关心和掌握物资的库存情况。有的单位的领导人员，对库存物资缺乏了解，明明自己仓库里有，又盲目派人外出采购或请求调拨物资，不仅浪费了人力、物力、财力，反过来又加重了库存积压。因此，领导人员对于本单位物资库存情况必须心中有数，即便不能做到件件如数家珍，至少对重要物资要了解得清清楚楚。
    我国的生产建设正在继续大跃进中，我们能够生产的原料、燃料、材料，从总的方面来看，经常是满足不了实际需要的。当然，根本的问题是增加生产。但是，与此同时，完全有必要使有限的物资得到最合理的使用，这是我们社会主义建设者的天职。那些至今还没有进行清理物资的地方和单位，需要立即着手进行清理，好让呆滞的物资迅速投入生产第一线。
