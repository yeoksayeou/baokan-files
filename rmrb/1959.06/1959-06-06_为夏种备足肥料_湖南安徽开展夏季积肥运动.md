　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 5th — More than 3.6 million farmers in Hunan Province have joined the summer manure collection campaign. In the past 25 days, the province has collected more than 1.9 billion dan of fertilizer, including more than 100 million dan of fine fertilizer such as human and animal waste. Various places have adopted the "four simultaneous" method of collecting manure, composting it, transporting it, and applying top dressing to the rice paddies, to ensure that the early rice is well-fed during the tillering and panicle initiation stages, and to strive for large panicles, many grains, and full grains. At present, 85% of the province's 17 million mu of early rice fields have been top-dressed with one or two applications of fast-acting fertilizer in conjunction with mid-season cultivation and weeding, generally more than 40 dan of fertilizer per mu. Now, the early rice in the province has generally entered the peak tillering stage and is growing luxuriantly, with a better growth trend than in previous years.

　　The planned output of early rice in Hunan Province accounts for about one-third of the province's total planned grain output this year. Striving for a bumper harvest of early rice is of great significance for ensuring the completion of the province's grain production increase plan this year. This year's early rice was generally sown early and transplanted well, and the seedlings grew well. However, due to the sowing and transplanting season being advanced by about ten days compared with previous years, the time for spring manure collection was short, and some early rice fields had insufficient base fertilizer. At present, the early rice is generally tillering, and the earlier planted rice has entered the panicle initiation stage, which is the turning point from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, and is also an important juncture that determines the length of the panicles and the number of grains in the future. However, about 20% of the early rice fields in the province are severely deficient in fertilizer, and need timely and rational mid-season cultivation and top-dressing.

　　In the manure collection, the people's communes in various places have adopted the method of division of labor and specialized operations, and assembly line operations, which has greatly improved the efficiency of manure collection and fully demonstrated the great superiority of the people's communes. More than 50,000 manure collection troops in Guiyang County are divided into four fronts: manure collection, composting, manure transportation, and fertilization, advancing simultaneously. They collected more than 16.8 million dan of manure in ten days, and about 80% of the fertilizer was fermented and applied to the fields according to the condition of the crops and the land. In top-dressing, various places generally adopt the method of "three-way consultation" by leading cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to conduct on-site inspections and identify the seedlings plot by plot. What kind of fertilizer is lacking, and what kind of fertilizer is added. After the seedlings were lined up for inspection, the Wengjiang People's Commune in Pingjiang County adopted five or six different methods of top-dressing and field management, implementing division of labor and responsibility.

　　In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient fine fertilizer in early rice top-dressing, various places are vigorously creating local chemical fertilizers while carrying out large-scale collection of farmyard manure. By mid-May, the province had produced more than 220,000 tons of various local chemical fertilizers, including more than 90,000 tons of phosphate and potash fertilizers, which can solve the difficulty of insufficient phosphate and potash fertilizers in more than 1 million mu of rice fields.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 3rd — Various places in Anhui Province are using the gap before the summer harvest to carry out a summer manure collection and fertilizer production campaign, preparing relatively sufficient fertilizer for summer crops. Wuhu Prefecture has collected 1.21 billion dan of various fertilizers in May, and Anqing Prefecture has collected more than 500 million dan of various natural fertilizers from mid-May to the end of May.

　　In the summer manure collection campaign, various places in Anhui Province have adopted the method of detailed accounting to find out the favorable conditions for summer manure collection, so that cadres and the masses can recognize the importance of carrying out a concentrated manure collection campaign to ensure a bumper harvest throughout the year, and generally improve the enthusiasm of the masses for collecting and producing manure.

　　In the manure collection campaign, some people vigorously carried out high-temperature composting in the fields, shoveling grass from the wheat stubble, rice field ridges or nearby, mixing it with lime, grass ash, and dry soil, pouring sewage on it, and piling it up for fermentation before applying it to the fields; some composted green manure, putting all the ponds, ditches, field cellars, and large fertilizer depots near the wheat stubble and rice fields into green grass, and sprinkled lime to speed up the composting speed; some burned soil buns in the fields to smoke fertilizer (generally eleven to fifteen per mu, each about 300 dan) and vigorously collected miscellaneous fertilizer. The former Nanping People's Commune in Quanjiao County adopted these methods and prepared enough fertilizer for 19,800 mu of wheat stubble fields in four days. Zhangdian Commune in Luan County adopted these methods and harvested 2.17 million jin of green fertilizer and collected 610,000 dan of various miscellaneous fertilizers in three days. After the mountain people of Hehan County devoted all their efforts to cutting green grass, the hilly areas mainly cut green grass, dredged pond mud, shoveled grass, and the polder area dredged pond mud and river mud, collected aquatic plants, and combined with cutting green grass and other methods, the county accumulated and produced a total of 17.39 million dan of fertilizer in three days.

　　Some places also used ditches, ponds, and reservoirs to raise a large number of aquatic animals such as clams, snails, and grass shrimp as fertilizer, adapting to local conditions. According to statistics, some people's communes in Huaiyuan, Jiashan and other counties have raised these aquatic organisms on more than 340 mu.

　　In the concentrated manure collection, various places have established professional teams, and set quantity and quality standards according to the strength of the labor force, the distance of the road, and the difficulty of manure collection, and implemented the method of rewarding over-fulfillment. The fertilizer collected by the members during their spare time is purchased at a price based on quality.

    为夏种备足肥料
    湖南安徽开展夏季积肥运动
    本报长沙5日电　湖南省三百六十多万农民投入夏季积肥运动。最近二十五天中，全省积肥十九亿多担，其中人畜粪等精肥有一亿多担。各地采取边积肥、边沤制、边运肥、边看禾追肥的
  “四边”办法，保证早稻在分蘖孕穗期吃饱吃好，为争取早稻穗大、粒多、子粒饱满而斗争。目前，全省一千七百多万亩早稻中，已有85％的早稻田结合中耕除草追施了一、两次速效性肥料，一般每亩追肥四十多担。现在全省早稻普遍进入分蘖盛期，正青葱茁壮地成长，禾苗来势较往年好。
    湖南省早稻计划产量约占今年全省粮食计划总产量的三分之一。争取早稻丰收，对保证今年全省粮食增产计划的完成有很大意义。今年早稻一般播得早，插得好，苗期生长良好。但是由于播种插秧季节较往年提早十来天，春季积肥时间短，部分早稻田基肥不足。目前早稻普遍分蘖，栽插较早的已进入孕穗期，正是早稻由营养生长到生殖生长的转折时期，也是决定将来穗子长短、谷粒多少的重要关头。但是，全省约有20％左右的早稻田缺肥情况比较严重，需要适时合理地中耕追肥。
    各地人民公社在积肥中，采取分工分业，流水作业的办法，大大提高积肥工效，充分显示了人民公社的巨大优越性。桂阳县五万多名积肥大军，分为积肥、沤肥、运肥、施肥四条战线齐头并进，十天中积肥一千六百八十多万担，约有80％的肥料经过发酵后，看禾看田分别施下了田。在追肥中，各地一般采取领导干部、老农和技术员“三头会诊”的办法，进行临田察看，逐丘逐块地鉴定禾苗，缺什么肥，补什么肥。平江县瓮江人民公社经过禾苗排队后，采取了五、六种不同的追肥和田间管理方法，实行分片包干、专人负责。
    为了解决早稻追肥中的精肥不足的困难，各地在开展大积农家肥的同时，大造土化肥。到5月中旬止，全省已制造各种土化肥二十二万多吨，其中磷钾肥占九万多吨，可以解决一百多万亩稻田的磷钾肥料不足的困难。（胡坚）
    据新华社合肥3日电安徽省各地利用夏收前的空隙开展夏季积肥造肥运动，为夏种作物准备了比较充分的肥料。芜湖专区5月份已积各种肥料十二亿一千万担，安庆专区从5月中旬到5月底积各种自然肥料五亿多担。
    安徽省各地在夏季积肥运动中采取算细账的办法，找出夏季积肥的有利条件，使干部和群众认识到开展突击积肥对保证全年丰收的重要意义，普遍提高了群众的积肥、造肥积极性。
    各地人民在积肥运动中有的大搞田头高温堆肥，在麦茬稻田埂或附近就地铲草皮，用石灰、草木灰和干土拌和后，浇上污水，堆起来发酵后下田；有的沤绿肥，把麦茬、稻田附近所有水塘、水沟、田头窖和大肥库，全部沤上青草，并撒上石灰，加快沤肥速度；有的在田头烧土包子熏肥（一般每亩烧十一个到十五个，每个三百担左右）和大搞杂肥。原全椒县南屏人民公社采取这些办法，四天时间就为一万九千八百亩麦茬田准备了足够的肥料。六安县张店公社采用这些办法，三天时间就打青肥二百一十七万斤，积各种杂肥六十一万担。和含县山区人民全力割青草；丘陵地区主要割青草，打捞塘泥、铲草皮；圩区捞塘泥河泥，捞水草，结合割青草等办法后，全县三天共积肥、造肥一千七百三十九万担。
    有些地方还因地制宜地利用沟、塘、水库，大量养殖蛤蚌、螺丝、草虾等水生动物作肥料。据统计，怀远、嘉山等县部分人民公社已养殖这些水生物三百四十多亩。
    在突击积肥中，各地都建立了专业队，并根据劳力强弱，路途远近，积肥难易规定数量和质量标准，实行超额奖励的办法。对社员利用空隙时间积的肥料，按质论价收购。
