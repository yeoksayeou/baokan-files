    Turning Waste into Raw Materials
    Xi'an Purchases Large Quantities of Waste Products to Supply Factories
    Taiyuan Increases Purchasing Personnel for a Waste Product Collection Blitz
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 13th. The commercial system in Xi'an is mobilizing all stores and all personnel to collect waste and scrap materials.

    From January to early June this year, the city collected over 1,200 types of waste products, including scrap steel, mixed copper, waste lead-tin, waste zinc, and waste paper, with a total value of 3,396,600 yuan, equivalent to 70% of the total waste product recovery last year. The majority of these waste products are supplied to local factories producing steel, machinery, enamelware, and paper, where they are processed and used as raw materials for production.

    Units and residents in Xi'an are enthusiastically participating in the waste product collection effort. The Xincheng District held an exhibition called "Turning Waste into Treasure, Turning Useless into Useful." After displaying many daily necessities processed and replicated from waste products, the general public realized that waste products had many uses, and within a few days, they actively sold over 100,000 yuan worth of waste products. To meet the public's demand for regularly selling waste products, the Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Commerce is increasing the number of collection points and developing volunteer collectors in government agencies, factories, hospitals, and schools to ensure that the waste product collection network covers the entire city.
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 13th. Recently, from government agencies to factories, from streets to rural areas, commercial personnel pushing vehicles to collect waste products can be seen everywhere in Taiyuan.

    To meet the demands of various units and the public, the municipal commercial departments launched a blitz to recover waste products from late May. In addition to the original twelve waste product collection points and over five hundred professional collectors, the commercial system mobilized over 1,300 employees with 385 small carts to collect waste products door-to-door. Over 2,000 retail outlets, which previously only sold goods, have also posted advertisements to collect waste products on behalf of the state. In just seven days, the city recovered 1,500 tons of waste materials, worth over 580,000 yuan.

    According to plan, this waste product collection blitz will continue until the end of June. The recovered waste products will be utilized by local factories and handicraft cooperatives as raw materials. (Attached Picture)

    把废品变成原料
    西安收购大批废品供应工厂使用
    太原增加收购人员突击回收废品
    新华社西安13日电　西安市商业系统店店收购、人人动手，回收废旧物资。
    今年1月到6月初，全市共回收废钢铁、杂铜、废铅锡、废锌、废纸等一千二百多种废品，总值三百三十九万六千多元，相当于去年废品回收额的70％。这些废品，大部分供给本市钢铁、机械、搪瓷、造纸等工厂，加工整理后作为生产原料。
    西安市各单位和居民群众踊跃参加废品回收工作。新城区举办“废物变活宝、无用变有用”的展览会，展览出许多用废品加工复制的日用品以后，广大群众知道废品用处不少，几天之内就踊跃出售废品十多万元。西安市商业局为了满足群众经常出售废品的要求，正在增设收购点，在机关、工厂、医院、学校发展义务收购员，使废品收购网遍布全市。
    新华社太原13日电　近日来，太原市从机关到工厂，从街巷到农村，到处可以看到商业人员推着车辆在收购废品。
    市商业部门适应各单位和群众的要求，从5月下旬起开展了突击回收废品的运动。全市除了原有的十二个废品收购点和五百多名专业收购人员以外，商业系统抽出了一千三百多名职工带着三百八十五辆小平车，串街串巷收购。过去只是出售商品的零售门市部，也有两千多家贴出广告，代收废品。在短短七天内，全市就回收废旧物资一千五百吨，价值五十八万多元。
    按照计划，这次突击回收工作将进行到6月底。所回收的废品，将由本市一些工厂和手工业社利用起来作为原料。（附图片）
