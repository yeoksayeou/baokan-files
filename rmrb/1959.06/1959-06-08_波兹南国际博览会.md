    Poznań International Fair
    The Poznań International Fair is a member of the International Fairs Union, with a long history and modern architectural facilities. Poznań was designated as a place for exhibitions and markets as early as the thirteenth century, and achieved significant development by the sixteenth century. However, years of war caused great losses to Poznań, and it was not reorganized until the twentieth century. In 1924, it reappeared as an international event and became one of the larger and more commercially renowned fairs in Europe. After World War II, the fair resumed its activities. However, due to the serious damage to the Polish economy during the war, which had not yet fully recovered, the fair had to be suspended from 1950 to 1954. It continued its exhibitions in 1955.
    This year's Poznań Fair is unprecedented in scale, with forty-seven countries participating in the exhibition.
    This year's fair demonstrates the increasingly developing economy and technological progress of socialist countries. The Soviet Pavilion has become the center of attention. The new-style machines on display have aroused great interest.
    The Polish side will exhibit more than 35,000 exhibits produced by more than 1,000 state-owned factories, cooperative enterprises, and handicrafts, including traditional export commodities and new industrial products.
    Since my country first participated in the Poznań Fair in 1955, this year is the fourth time. This time, my country exhibited 3,300 exhibits. In previous exhibitions, the Chinese Pavilion left a deep impression on people. (Shen Zheming)

    波兹南国际博览会
    波兹南国际博览会是国际博览会联盟成员之一，具有悠久的历史和现代化的建筑设备。波兹南早在十三世纪便被指定为展览和市集的场所，到十六世纪获得了显著的发展。但连年的战争使波兹南蒙受了很大的损失，直到二十世纪才重新组织起来。1924年重新以国际性的面貌出现，成为欧洲规模较大和贸易著名的博览会之一。第二次世界大战后，博览会又恢复了活动。但由于波兰经济在战争中受到严重破坏，一时尚未完全恢复，博览会自1950—1954年不得不停止举行。直到1955年才继续展览。
    本届波兹南博览会规模空前盛大，参加展出的国家有四十七个。
    今年的博览会显示了社会主义国家经济日益发展和技术进步的景象。苏联展览馆成为人们注意的中心。它展出的新式机器引起人们很大的兴趣。
    波兰方面将展出一千余个国营工厂、合作企业和手工业所生产的三万五千余种展品，包括传统的出口商品和新的工业产品。
    我国自1955年第一次参加波兹南博览会展出以来，今年已是第四次了。这次我国展出了三千三百种展品。在历次展出中，中国馆给人们留下了深刻的印象。　（沈哲明）
