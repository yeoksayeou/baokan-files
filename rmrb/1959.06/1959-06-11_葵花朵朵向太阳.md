    Sunflowers Face the Sun

    The sunflower is a follower of the sun. In the morning, when the sun appears in the east, it greets the rising sun with a smile. When the sun sets in the west, it turns to the west again to bid farewell to the setting sun. Therefore, it is called "sunflower" or "turning-sun lotus," "morning sun flower."

    In fact, most higher plants have this heliotropic property and like to grow towards the direction with sufficient sunlight. There is a substance in plants that can stimulate cell growth, called auxin. The total flower axis at the base of the sunflower's stem-top disc contains a lot of such growth stimulants, so it grows rapidly. However, this growth stimulant is easily destroyed by sunlight. When the morning sun rises in the east, the auxin in the sunflower flower axis is destroyed on the east side, so the east side grows slower than the west side. Because of the difference in growth speed between the two sides, the flower disc will bend to the slower-growing east side, where more auxin has been destroyed. When the evening sun sets in the west, there is more auxin on the east side than on the west side, so the flower disc bends westward again.

    The sunflower's heliotropism is caused by uneven growth. Therefore, when it begins to bear fruit and is nearly mature, there is very little auxin in the total flower axis. In addition, the weight increases due to bearing fruit, making it inconvenient to turn, so it no longer turns. It greedily stares at the south, where the sunlight is most abundant, all day long.

    葵花朵朵向太阳
    向日葵是太阳的追随者。早晨当太阳从东方出现时，她就满面笑容地迎接着上升的旭日，当日落西山时，它又转向西方，欢送那西下的夕阳。因此，它被人们称作“向日葵”或“转日莲”、“朝阳花”。
    其实，一般高等植物都具有这种向日性，都喜欢朝向阳光充足的方向生长。在植物体内有一种能刺激细胞生长的物质，叫生长素。向日葵的茎顶花盘基部的总花轴内，含有很多这样的生长刺激素，所以生长迅速。但是这种生长刺激素易被阳光所破坏。早晨旭日东升，向日葵花轴里的生长素向东的一面遭到破坏，所以朝东一面长得比朝西一面慢，由于两面的生长速度有了不同，就会使花盘弯向长得较慢，生长素被破坏得较多的东面来。傍晚夕阳西斜，朝东一面的生长素又比朝西的多，所以花盘又向西弯。
    向日葵的向日现象既是由于不均匀的生长所引起的，所以当它开始结实，将近成熟时，总花轴内的生长素已经很少，再加上因结实而增加了重量，不便转动，也就不再转了。她就一天到晚贪婪地望着阳光最充分的南方。
