    The Soviet Union Comprehensively Carries Out Communist Education
    Fang Xuan
    The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sounded the bugle call for a great march toward communism to all the people of the Soviet Union. In the comprehensive communist construction, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regards the communist education of the entire people as one of the important tasks. In the speeches of the Soviet Party leaders and in the Soviet newspapers and periodicals, it has been repeatedly emphasized that the transition to communism requires not only a strong material and technical foundation but also a high level of awareness of all the people; the higher the awareness of the millions of people, the smoother the completion of the communist construction plan. In addition, it is specifically pointed out that the issue of ideological work is of great significance under the current conditions because it is also necessary to struggle against the destructive effects of imperialism's ideology and the remnants of capitalism in people's minds.
    After the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the CPSU Central Committee made a series of important resolutions and took many concrete measures in carrying out communist education for the entire people. The party organizations of various Soviet republics and regions, under the leadership of the first secretaries, held meetings one after another to specifically study ideological education work. The common thread running through these meetings was to actively carry out communist education, raise the ideological awareness of the entire people, and strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. During this period, the Soviet newspapers and periodicals devoted a large amount of space to reflecting and elaborating on various issues of ideological education and vigorously promoted the excellent experiences of some party organizations in mass political work and grassroots work. The Soviet people, inspired by the magnificent program of building communism—the Seven-Year Plan—raised the clear banner of "working, studying, and living in a communist way." A vast, magnificent, diverse, and rich communist education movement has been launched throughout the Soviet Union.
    Improving the Level of Party Work
    The grand plan of comprehensively carrying out communist construction requires raising the level of party work to meet the requirements of the new tasks. Because the new task of educating the entire people to have a high level of awareness is a very arduous one. As Iliyichev, head of the Propaganda Department of the CPSU Central Committee, pointed out in a recent article published in the "Kommunist" magazine, "Without the great organizational and educational work of the Communist Party, this task cannot be solved."
    After the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the CPSU Central Committee immediately issued an instruction to study and publicize the documents of the Party Congress, calling on the entire Party and the entire people to study the documents in depth, link them with reality, and launch a wave of labor enthusiasm. The instruction stipulates that the Party's education network should take the study of the documents of the Party Congress as the central task and requires every Party member to actively participate in propaganda work.
    Subsequently, the CPSU Central Committee adopted a resolution on "The Situation of the Political Work of the Working People of Stalin Oblast and Measures for Its Improvement." The resolution specifically noted the need to overcome the shortcomings of formalism and detachment from reality that existed in this work in the past, and to strengthen the connection between ideological work and life, and improve the effectiveness of the work. The resolution emphasized that the responsible cadres of the Party must go deep into the lives of the masses, requiring all the heads of the Party, government, and people's organizations to regularly give political reports to the broad masses, and instructed the first secretaries of the Oblast Committees, Municipal Committees, and District Committees to regularly report to the propagandists.
    In the short period of a few months after the 21st Congress of the CPSU, a very active situation appeared in the mass political work of the Soviet Party. Party organizations at all levels sent a large number of propagandists to work among the broad masses. For example, the Party organization of the Azerbaijan Republic sent more than 60,000 propagandists to work in grassroots Party organizations. In the Sverdlovsk Oblast alone, more than 10,000 people explained the basic spirit of the Party Congress to the broad masses. In Moscow, 200,000 people were engaged in mass political work.
    The large-scale mass political work carried out throughout the Soviet Union during this period had distinct characteristics: diverse forms, specific content, and close ties to reality.
    The forms of mass political work include report meetings, lectures, symposiums, question-and-answer evenings, cultural universities, cultural propaganda teams, comprehensive report meetings, television, movies, exhibitions, satirical critical tabloids, wall newspapers, and so on. Many republics and states have established a unified "Political Reporting Day". Many factory workshops used lunch breaks as "Question and Answer Time", with workshop directors or party secretaries personally answering questions from employees on all aspects of international and domestic affairs, production, and life. In the fields of the vast countryside, fixed propaganda stations have been established everywhere to organize reading newspapers, discussions, and film screenings during the farmers' rest time.
    Here, it is worth mentioning in particular the Cultural University. It is a new and mass political and aesthetic education organization form that emerged after the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The curriculum of the Cultural University generally includes three parts: socio-politics, the basic theory of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics, and specialized courses such as literature, drama, and music. Due to the people's high political enthusiasm and learning enthusiasm, the Cultural University has sprung up like mushrooms after rain. At present, there are more than 1,000 Cultural Universities in the Soviet Union, including hundreds of thousands of students, including workers, farmers, and staff.
    In terms of the content of mass political work, it has also been specific and closely integrated with practice. Through document study, report meetings, and discussions, the broad masses of working people not only clarified the tasks put forward by the Party Congress, but also linked them to the tasks of their own factories and collective farms, and put forward collective and individual guarantee conditions. In this way, through the Party's ideological work, a creative labor atmosphere has been created in every factory, collective farm, and institution.
    The editorial in the fourth issue of "Kommunist" magazine gave a very high evaluation of the mass political work during this period. The editorial wrote: "It can be said with certainty that the current mass political work is so creative and the forms and methods are so diverse that our party has never had it in practice."
    Establishing a New Communist Ethos
    In the vigorous communist education carried out in the Soviet Union, a clear banner against capitalist ideology and remnants of the old society has been erected. Comrade Khrushchev clearly pointed out at the 21st Congress of the CPSU that communist views and codes of conduct are established in the struggle against the remnants of capitalism, and we must not sit idly by and wait for the remnants of capitalism to eliminate themselves; we must resolutely struggle against them.
    In recent months, with the start of the great march towards communism, the Soviet people have launched an offensive against the remnants of capitalism from a theoretical, practical, and life perspective. The Soviet theoretical circles have discussed the reasons for the existence of capitalist remnants, and believe that the main reason for the existence of capitalist remnants in people's consciousness is that social consciousness lags behind social existence. Some theorists believe that the problem of capitalist remnants does not exist in people who were born and grew up under the socialist system, thus belittling the importance of ideological education work. Iliyichev, head of the Propaganda Department of the CPSU Central Committee, criticized this view in an article published in "Kommunist" magazine. He emphasized that the existence of capitalist remnants is greatly influenced by bourgeois ideology. Socialist countries are not isolated from the capitalist world, and their cultural, travel, and other ties are expanding. Therefore, we must fully strengthen ideological work and resolutely struggle against the influence of bourgeois ideology.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union called on the entire people to actively oppose the remnants of private ownership: such as individualistic tendencies, idleness, contempt for labor, alcoholism, hooliganism, speculation, etc. In terms of measures, the policy of mobilizing broad public opinion and utilizing mass supervision has been adopted. Taking the fight against alcoholism as an example, in addition to the government's measures such as prohibiting private brewing of alcohol, a large number of comments, articles, and critical cartoons on the issue of alcoholism have been published in newspapers and periodicals; the Communist Youth League has organized patrols on the streets, and comrades have strengthened criticism and self-criticism. As a result, a social atmosphere of resisting alcoholism has formed.
    Recently, mass organizations such as voluntary inspection teams, comrade trial meetings, youth sentry posts, and street women's committees, which have been voluntarily established by people in various parts of the Soviet Union, have played a great role in opposing acts that undermine communist morality. The CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers recently issued a resolution on the participation of working people in maintaining social order. The resolution strongly supports the establishment of people's voluntary inspection teams in various enterprises, collective farms, institutions, schools, and other units, and stipulates that these organizations are led by the headquarters composed of Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League representatives in each district and city, and the members of the inspection teams must be advanced elements.
    Recently, in factories and collective farms, the form of staff and worker congresses and peasant member congresses has also been used more frequently to launch criticism and self-criticism of non-communist labor and lifestyle attitudes. For example, the steelmaking workshop of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory recently held a unique Communist Youth League congress. The congress not only invited Party members and foremen from the workshop to participate, but also invited the spouses, parents, and neighbors of the League members to participate. In addition to assessing the League members' achievements in production, the meeting also discussed whether they treated comrades, spouses, and relatives with a communist attitude. Sharp criticisms were launched at the old ideological remnants of individuals.
    While opposing the remnants of capitalism, in the labor process of realizing the great program of building communism—the Seven-Year Plan—a large number of collectives and heroic figures with noble communist style have continuously emerged throughout the Soviet Union. The "Communist Labor Brigade" and "Shock Worker" movement, with the slogan of "working, studying, and living in a communist way", is sweeping the country with a turbulent momentum. Collectives and individuals participating in the movement generally made guarantee conditions for completing the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule in terms of production; in terms of study, they made measures for each person to improve their professional and cultural level, and actively participated in amateur studies; in terms of life, they put forward slogans such as "promote communist moral qualities" and "resolutely fight against all capitalist remnants". Wherever the movement reached, the atmosphere was completely new, and advanced deeds emerged one after another. For example, Gaganova, the captain of the work team and a Communist Party member of the Vishny Volochyok Cotton Textile Factory in Kalinin Oblast, left the advanced team to help the backward team, and in a very short period of time, she changed the backward state of the team and entered the ranks of the advanced. Her communist work style has been taken as an example throughout the Soviet Union. The Mamai work team of Donbass miners produced two tons more coal per person per shift; the Korchik work team of miners saved two rubles for every ton of coal mined, and their initiative has been promoted throughout the Soviet Union. For example, the Communist Youth League members of the Kazakh Republic decided that the first year of the Seven-Year Plan would be a shock year and strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years; the Communist Youth League members of Leningrad also proposed the initiative to complete the task of increasing labor productivity stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in five years. A large number of young people responded to the Party's call, not afraid of difficulties and hardships, and rushed to construction sites in barren land and remote areas.
    Cultivating Future Communist Newcomers
    Cultivating future newcomers and strengthening communist education for the younger generation is an important part of the current Soviet ideological work.
    Regarding this issue, the Soviet newspapers and periodicals specifically emphasized that newcomers are not produced out of thin air, but grow up in labor. This is evidenced by the emergence of a large number of advanced figures in the production labor to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. And recently, the issue of cultivating young students' communist labor outlook has become the focus of attention of the Soviet Party and the entire society.
    On the eve of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers put forward the "Outline on Strengthening the Connection between Schools and Life and Further Developing the Soviet National Education System". Subsequently, the Supreme Soviet passed the education reform law. For the past six months, the entire Soviet people have launched a heated discussion on this issue. In the Russian Federation alone, more than 200,000 meetings have been held. Recently, the Supreme Soviets of the various Soviet republics convened meetings and passed laws to reform national education, deciding to complete the reform in three to five years starting this year. With the realization of educational reform, young students will participate in social public welfare labor from the age of fifteen or sixteen, without exception; primary and secondary schools will face production and establish close ties with factories and collective farms; and university students will generally go to production posts to study in the first two years or the last year.
    At present, the Soviet Union has basically realized the method of recruiting university students from working posts. The proportion of young people with more than two years of work experience or who have served in the army among new university students is: 64% in 1957, 75% in 1958, and 80% in 1959.
    The entire Soviet society is very concerned about the education of the younger generation. Recently, the Soviet Communist Youth League made a decision on the work of the League organization in education reform. The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions also made a resolution on the work of trade union organizations in implementing the education reform law. The resolution stipulates that it will assist various factories in establishing close ties with schools, regularly study the labor education of students together with the school's teachers' committee, and stipulate that the trade union's cultural institutions should widely establish youth technology palaces. The Ministry of Education and the Academy of Education of the Russian Federation have formulated a draft of principles on eight-year middle schools and various types of middle schools. According to this draft, each eight-year middle school will be helped by a fixed factory or collective farm.
    With the implementation of educational reform, due to the relationship between the Party, the League, the trade union, student parents, factories, collective farms... the entire society and the labor education of young people, a new atmosphere has appeared among the students. For example, after the 21st Congress of the CPSU, a heated "self-service" movement was launched in colleges and universities throughout the Soviet Union, that is, all service work in classrooms, dormitories, etc.: such as cleaning, tidying up the campus, guarding the door, managing books, etc., are all done by the students themselves. The students said well: We are not little babies, and we still need nannies to follow us all day long! Many schools have organized students to build construction teams to build school buildings and repair furniture for their schools. Recently, the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers passed a resolution deciding to expand the self-service work of students, believing that this is of great significance for successfully solving the problem of strengthening the connection between schools and life and improving the labor education of young people.
    The noble communist qualities of respecting labor and loving labor are rapidly growing among Soviet youth. In recent years, there have been countless examples of entire classes of students from colleges and universities rushing to construction sites in barren land and remote areas of the motherland. Since the 21st Congress of the CPSU issued a call to young people to continue to support the barren land, a "go to the barren land" movement has first launched among young women. Because nurseries, schools, canteens, tailor shops, etc. in the barren land urgently need them. At present, thousands of girls have bid farewell to their relatives, abandoned their comfortable living environment, and happily rushed to the front line of the motherland's communist construction.
    In the vigorous "Communist Labor Brigade" and "Shock Worker" movement launched throughout the Soviet Union, students also established close ties with the "Communist Labor Brigade". They proposed to better strengthen labor and train themselves to become excellent reserve teams for the "Communist Labor Brigade".
    At present, the Soviet communist education movement is developing in depth. The slogan "work, study, and live in a communist way" is vigorously encouraging the Soviet people to realize the magnificent program of building communism—completing the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    苏联全面开展共产主义教育
    方萱
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，向全苏人民吹起了向共产主义大进军的号角。在全面开展的共产主义建设中，苏联共产党把对全民的共产主义教育列为重要的任务之一。在苏联党的负责人的讲话中，在苏联报刊上，都反复强调指出，过渡到共产主义不仅需要有强大的物质技术基础，而且需要有全体人民的高度觉悟水平；千百万群众的觉悟愈高，完成共产主义建设计划就愈顺利。此外，并且特别指明，思想工作问题之所以在目前条件下具有重要的意义，还因为要同帝国主义思想的破坏作用和人们意识中的资本主义残余进行斗争。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，苏共中央在开展全民的共产主义教育方面，作出了一系列的重要决议，并且采取了很多的具体措施。苏联各加盟共和国和各地党组织在第一书记的主持下，纷纷召开会议，专门研究了思想教育工作。贯穿在这些会议上的一根红线就是，积极开展共产主义教育，提高全民的思想觉悟，为提前完成七年计划而奋斗。在这一时期，苏联报刊以大量篇幅反映和阐述了目前思想教育方面的各种问题，并且大力推广了一些党组织在群众政治工作和基层工作中的优良经验。为建设共产主义的宏伟纲领——七年计划所鼓舞的苏联人民，高举起“按照共产主义的方式工作、学习和生活”的鲜明旗帜。在整个苏维埃大地上，掀起了一个声势浩大、规模宏伟、形式多种多样、内容丰富多彩的共产主义教育运动。
    提高党的工作的水平
    全面开展共产主义建设的宏伟计划，要求提高党的工作的水平，以便能够适应新任务的要求。因为教育全民使之具有高度的觉悟水平这项新的任务是一项十分艰巨的任务。正如苏共中央宣传鼓动部部长伊里乔夫最近在“共产党人”杂志发表的一篇文章中所指出的，“如果没有共产党的巨大的组织工作和教育工作，这项任务是不可能解决的。”
    苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，苏共中央立即发出了一个研究和宣传党代表大会文件的指示，号召全党全民深入学习文件，联系实际，掀起劳动的热潮。指示中规定党的教育网要把学习党代表大会的文件作为中心任务，并且要求每个党员积极参加宣传鼓动工作。
    接着，苏共中央又通过了一项“关于斯大林州劳动人民群众政治工作的状况及其改进措施”的决议。决议中特别注意到克服过去这项工作中存在的形式主义、脱离实际的缺点，要求加强思想工作同生活的联系，提高工作的效果。决议强调指出，党的负责干部必须深入群众生活，要求所有的党、政、人民团体的负责人定期向广大群众作政治报告，并责成州委、市委、区委的第一书记定期为宣传鼓动员作报告。
    在苏共第二十一次代表大会后短短几个月期间，苏联党的群众政治工作出现了十分活跃的局面。各级党组织派出了大批的宣传鼓动员，深入广大群众进行工作。例如，阿塞拜疆共和国党组织派了六万多名宣传员到基层党组织去工作。仅在斯维德洛夫一个州，就有一万多人向广大群众解释了党代表大会的基本精神。在莫斯科，有二十万人从事群众政治工作。
    这个期间在全苏联开展的规模庞大的群众政治工作，具有鲜明的特点：形式多种多样，内容具体，联系实际。
    群众政治工作的形式有报告会、讲座、座谈、问题解答晚会、文化大学、文化宣传队、综合性报告会、电视、电影、展览会、讽刺批评小报、墙报，等等。许多加盟共和国和州都确定了统一的“政治报告日”。许多工厂的车间把午休时间作为“问题解答时间”，由车间主任或党组织书记亲自解答职工们提出的有关国际和国内、生产和生活各方面的问题。在广大农村的田野上，到处建立了固定的宣传鼓动站，利用农民休息的时间，组织读报、讨论、放映电影等活动。
    这里，值得特别提出的是文化大学。它是苏共第二十一次代表大会后出现的一种崭新的、群众性的政治和美学教育的组织形式。文化大学的课程一般包括社会政治、马克思列宁主义美学基础和文学、戏剧、音乐等专修课等三个部分。由于劳动人民具有高度的政治热情和学习热情，文化大学有如雨后春笋般涌现出来。目前，全苏联已有一千多所文化大学，包括工人、农民、职员等学员几十万人。
    在群众政治工作的内容上，也作到了具体和紧密结合实际。广大劳动群众通过文件学习、报告会、讨论会，不仅明确了党代表大会提出的各项任务，而且联系到自己的工厂、农庄的任务，提出了集体和个人的保证条件。这样，通过党的各项思想工作，就在每个工厂、农庄和机关造成了一种创造性的劳动气氛。
    对于这个期间的群众政治工作，“共产党人”杂志第四期的社论给予很高的评价。社论写道：“可以肯定的说，目前的群众政治工作如此富有创造性，形式、方法如此多样，这是我党在实践中从来未有过的。”
    树立共产主义新风气
    在全苏蓬勃开展的共产主义教育中，树立起一面反对资本主义思想和旧社会残余的鲜明旗帜。赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上明确地指出，共产主义的观点和行为准则是在同资本主义残余的斗争中确立的，不能坐待资本主义残余自行消灭，必须对它进行坚决的斗争。
    最近几个月，随着向共产主义大进军的开始，苏联人民从理论上、实际工作和生活中，向资本主义残余展开了攻势。苏联理论界探讨了资本主义残余存在的原因问题，认为人们意识中资本主义残余存在的主要原因是社会意识落后于社会存在。有些理论家认为，在社会主义制度下诞生和成长的人的身上，不存在资本主义残余的问题，因而贬低了思想教育工作的重要性。苏共中央宣传鼓动部部长伊里乔夫在“共产党人”杂志发表的文章中批判了这个观点。他强调指出，资本主义残余的存在，受资产阶级思想的影响很大，社会主义国家同资本主义世界并不是隔绝的，而且它们之间的文化、旅行等方面的联系日益扩大。因此，必须全力加强思想工作，同资产阶级思想的影响作坚决的斗争。
    苏联共产党号召全民积极反对私有制残余：如个人主义倾向、游手好闲、轻视劳动、酗酒、流氓行为、投机等。在措施上，采取了动员广大群众舆论，利用群众监督的方针。拿反对酗酒来说，除掉政府采取了禁止私自酿酒等措施外，并在报刊上就酗酒问题发表了大量的评论、文章和批评的漫画；共青团组织了纠察队在大街上巡逻，同志之间加强了批评与自我批评。这样一来，就在社会上形成了一种抵制酗酒行为的风气。
    近来，苏联各地人民自愿地建立的纠察队、同志审判会、青年岗哨、街道妇女委员会等群众组织，在反对破坏共产主义道德的行为上起了很大的作用。苏共中央和部长会议最近发布了一项关于劳动人民参加维持社会秩序的决议，决议中大力支持在各企业、农庄、机关、学校等单位建立人民自愿纠察队，并规定这些组织归各区、市的由党、政、工、团代表组成的司令部领导，纠察队的成员必须是先进分子。
    最近，在工厂和农庄，也更多的采用职工大会和庄员大会的形式，对非共产主义的劳动和生活态度展开批评与自我批评。例如，斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂炼钢车间，不久前召开了一次别开生面的共青团员大会。大会不但邀请了车间的党员、工长等人参加，而且还邀请了团员们的爱人、父母和邻居来参加。会上除了评定团员们在生产上的成绩外，还讨论了他们是否以共产主义的态度对待同志、爱人和亲人。会上对个别的人的旧思想残余展开了尖锐的批评。
    在反对资本主义残余的同时，在为实现伟大的建设共产主义的纲领——七年计划的劳动过程中，苏联全国不断涌现出大批具有共产主义崇高风格的集体和英雄人物。以“按照共产主义方式工作、学习和生活”为口号的“共产主义劳动队”和“突击手”运动，以奔腾澎湃之势席卷全国。参加运动的集体和个人，一般地都在生产方面订出了提前完成七年计划的保证条件；在学习方面订出了每个人提高业务和文化水平的措施，纷纷参加业余学习；生活方面，则提出“发扬共产主义道德品质”、“坚决与一切资本主义残余现象作斗争”等口号。运动所及的地方，气象焕然一新，先进事迹层出不穷。例如，加里宁州维什涅沃洛茨棉纺厂的工作队长、共产党员加干诺娃，她离开先进的队去帮助落后的队，在很短期间就使这个队改变了落后的状态，进入先进的行列。她的这种共产主义劳动作风，在全苏各地引为范例。顿巴斯矿工马马伊工作队作到了每人每班多生产两吨煤；矿工科尔奇克工作队作到了每采一吨煤节约两个卢布，他们的创举已在全苏各地推广。又如，哈萨克共和国的共青团员决定七年计划的第一年为突击年，争取五年完成七年计划；列宁格勒的共青团员也提出了五年完成七年计划规定的提高劳动生产率的任务的倡议。大批青年响应党的号召，不畏艰难困苦，奔赴荒地和边远地区的建设工地。
    培养未来的共产主义新人
    培养未来的新人，加强对青年一代的共产主义教育，是当前苏联整个思想工作中的重要环节。
    关于这个问题，苏联报刊上特别强调指出，新人不是凭空产生的，而是在劳动中成长起来的。在为提前完成七年计划的生产劳动中涌现出大批先进人物就证明了这一点。而最近一个时期，培养青年学生的共产主义劳动观点的问题，已成为苏联党和整个社会注目的中心。
    在苏共第二十一次代表大会前夕，苏共中央和部长会议就提出了“关于加强学校同生活的联系和进一步发展苏联国民教育制度”的提纲。接着，最高苏维埃通过了教育改革的法律。半年以来，全苏人民就这个问题展开了热烈的讨论，仅以俄罗斯联邦共和国来说，就举行了二十多万次会议。最近，苏联各加盟共和国最高苏维埃都召开了会议，通过了改革国民教育的法令，决定从今年起，三、五年内完成改革。随着教育改革的实现，青年学生自十五、六岁起，都要参加社会公益劳动，无一例外；中小学校面向生产，同工厂、农庄取得密切联系；大学生一般头两年或最后一年都要到生产岗位上学习。
    目前，苏联已经实现了基本由工作岗位上招收大学生的办法。具有两年以上工龄或在军队中服过役的青年占大学新生的比例：1957年为64％，1958年为75％，1959年规定为80％。
    苏联整个社会对青年一代的教育十分关怀。最近，苏联共青团作出了关于团组织在教育改革中的工作的决定。全苏工会中央理事会也作出了关于工会组织在实现教育改革法律中的工作的决议，决议中规定，协助各工厂同学校建立密切联系，同学校的教师委员会一起定期研究学生的劳动教育问题，并规定工会的文化机构要广泛建立青年技术宫。俄罗斯联邦共和国教育部和教育科学院制定了一项关于八年制中学和各类中学的原则草案，根据这个草案，每个八年制中学都由一个固定的工厂或农庄进行帮助。
    随着教育改革的进行，由于党、团、工会，学生家长、工厂、农庄……整个社会对青年劳动教育的关系，在学生中间出现了一片新气象。例如，苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，全苏大中学校里掀起了一个热火朝天的“自我服务”运动，即课堂、宿舍等处的一切服务性工作：像清洁卫生、整理校园、看门、管理图书等，全由学生自己来干。学生们说得好：我们也不是小娃娃，还要保姆成天跟在后面！很多学校组织了学生修建工程队，为自己的学校建筑校舍，修理家具。最近苏共中央和部长会议通过一项决议，决定扩大学生的自我服务工作，认为这对于顺利解决加强学校同生活的联系以及改进青年的劳动教育问题具有重大的意义。
    尊重劳动、热爱劳动的共产主义崇高品质，正在苏联青年身上迅速成长。近年来，大中学校中整班整班的学生奔赴荒地和祖国边远地区建设工地的例子不胜枚举。自从苏共第二十一次代表大会向青年们发出继续支援荒地的号召以来，首先在青年妇女中间展开了一个“到荒地去”的运动。因为荒地上的托儿所、学校、食堂、裁缝店等处都迫切需要她们。目前，成千上万的姑娘们，辞别了亲人，放弃了舒适的生活环境，兴高采烈地奔赴祖国共产主义建设的前线。
    在全苏展开的轰轰烈烈的“共产主义劳动队”和“突击手”运动中，学生们也同“共产主义劳动队”建立了密切联系，他们提出，要更好地加强劳动，把自己锻炼成优秀的“共产主义劳动队”的后备队。
    目前，苏联的共产主义教育运动正在深入开展中。“按照共产主义的方式工作、学习和生活”的口号正在有力地鼓舞着苏联人民实现建设共产主义的宏伟纲领——提前完成七年计划。
