Nanjing, June 5th. To ensure safe production during the deep-going campaign of increasing production and practicing economy, the Yongli Ning Factory in Nanjing has adopted measures to strengthen technical management and equipment maintenance.

The Yongli Ning Factory is a chemical plant that carries out production under high temperatures and high pressure, with a high degree of automation and mechanization of production equipment. Compared to last year, although the capacity of production equipment has slightly expanded and daily output has also increased, the total output has declined due to low equipment utilization. Recently, the factory held a five-level personnel meeting. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, a mass safety production inspection was carried out, identifying 184 hidden potential accidents, equipment defects, and other unsafe conditions. The identified equipment defects were then prioritized according to their severity and urgency, assigned to specific personnel for responsibility, and organized forces for a concentrated overhaul. The synthetic ammonia workshop, led by the mechanical engineer, organized a "medical team" of more than 30 people, including fitters, riveters, welders, painters, pipe fitters, and bricklayers, to carry out a concentrated overhaul of the workshop's pipelines and high-pressure equipment. The high-pressure machines, which had always been critical, were all completely rotated for repairs, ensuring the safe operation of each high-pressure machine. While carrying out a concentrated overhaul of the equipment, factory leaders also formulated measures to strengthen spare parts manufacturing, improve maintenance quality, and improve equipment maintenance management based on the opinions of the employees. It was also decided to establish an external pipeline work section and a corrosion prevention work section to strengthen the maintenance of external pipelines.

    加强设备维修保证安全生产
    永利宁厂发动群众性大检查
    本报南京5日电南京永利宁厂在深入开展增产节约运动中，为了保证安全生产，采取了加强技术管理，加强设备维护检修等措施。
    永利宁厂是一个以高温高压进行生产的化学工厂，生产设备的自动化、机械化程度较高。今年与去年相比，虽然生产设备能力稍有扩大，日产量也有所提高，但由于设备利用率低，总产量反而下降了。最近，这个厂召开了五级人员会议。在党委的领导下，开展了群众性的安全生产大检查，共找出生产上存在的隐形事故、设备缺陷和其他不安全现象一百八十四项。接着便将检查出来的设备缺陷，分别轻重缓急，指定专人负责，组织力量进行突击检修。合成氨车间由机械师负责组织了一支包括钳工、铆焊、油漆、配管、瓦工等三十多人的“医疗队”，对车间的管线和高压设备进行了突击检修。一直成为关键的高压机，这次也全部进行了轮修，使高压机部部安全运转。在突击检修设备的同时，厂级领导还根据职工们的意见，制订了加强备件制造、提高检修质量、健全设备维护管理的措施，并决定成立外管道工段和防腐蚀工段，加强外管道的维护。
