Grasping the selection and retention of seeds for summer harvest crops is an important task in the summer harvest. Judging from the situation in areas where seed selection and retention have already taken place, generally speaking, this year's seed retention has been sufficient in quantity and of good quality. Some areas have even retained additional reserve seeds, laying a good foundation for this year's autumn and winter planting. However, in some areas, seed selection and retention work has only remained at the level of general appeals and has not been implemented in communes and teams. Or, although it has been arranged for communes and teams, no specific arrangements have been made. Or, although some communes and teams have paid attention to seed selection and retention, there is a phenomenon of emphasizing quantity over quality. These are all detrimental to this year's autumn and winter planting and next year's harvest.
What is the reason for this? Is it that there are no good varieties to choose from? No. According to agricultural science institutions' investigations, the nation is extremely rich in farmer varieties, with 180,000 copies already collected, including more than 10,000 copies of wheat alone. These varieties each have their own characteristics and strengths. As long as they are carefully observed and evaluated, some good varieties suitable for local production needs can be selected from them. Is it that communes and teams are unwilling to do this work? No, farmers all know, "A good seed yields a thousand grains," and they are willing to select and retain good seeds. So why is this happening? The main reason is that some people believe that good varieties have already been popularized and there is no need to select seeds every year. Or they believe that many people's communes have already established specialized organizations for seed work, and the leadership does not need to worry about seed selection and retention. Or they believe that labor is very tight during the summer harvest season, and seed selection and retention work cannot be carried out at the same time as the summer harvest and planting. In the final analysis, this is still an ideological problem, especially the ideological problem of cadres.
Yes, seed selection work has greatly developed in recent years and has played a significant role in striving for agricultural harvests. However, seed selection and retention work is a long-term task and needs to be continuously developed. On the one hand, agricultural production is constantly developing, and the requirements for seeds are constantly increasing. The requirements for seeds are different before and after close planting. Therefore, seed selection and retention work can only become more and more detailed, not more and more crude. On the other hand, the seeds themselves are also changing. Under careful cultivation, they can become better and better. Under general management, they will deteriorate. According to a four-year investigation by Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, on the cultivation of the "Nanda 2419" wheat improved variety: the field purity in 1956 was 92%-93%, in 1957 it decreased to 89%, in 1958 it decreased to 84%, and in 1959 it was only about 80%. This example shows that even in areas where good varieties have already been popularized, seed selection is still a measure that cannot be ignored in order to maintain and continuously improve the yield-increasing effect of good varieties. Although many people's communes have specialized organizations for seed work, they still need leadership. If the leadership does not keep up, the specialized organizations cannot play their due role. The reason why some communes and teams only pay attention to quantity and not quality when selecting seeds is that they lack strong leadership. The summer harvest and planting require a lot of labor, which is a practical problem. However, as long as the arrangements are reasonable, the labor shortage problem can be solved. Taking the Zhongnan Brigade of the Nanping Commune in Hechuan County, Sichuan Province, as an example, some members of this brigade originally believed that labor was tight and seed selection could not be carried out. After calculating the labor account, this team, in addition to completing the summer harvest and planting, transferred eight to ten people from each production team to be specifically responsible for seed selection, drying, harvesting, threshing, and storage.
"A big mother makes for a fat son," is a proverb that every farmer knows. Therefore, when selecting seeds, we must first pay attention to the quality of the seeds. The quality of the seeds is closely related to whether a harvest can be obtained next year. Good quality seeds will result in full, vigorous, and strong seedlings after sowing. On this basis, coupled with thorough and meticulous field management, the summer harvest crops next year can achieve a bumper harvest. Secondly, attention should be paid to ear selection. Those who have established seed fields should conduct field inspections to remove impurities and inferior plants. Those who have not established seed fields can combine yield comparison and yield investigation to select plots with higher purity, uniform growth, and fewer pests and diseases for impurity removal and inferior plant removal for seed retention.
As for how much seed to retain, it is closely related to the planting area and close planting specifications of next year's summer harvest crops. The planting area of next year's summer harvest crops can now be definitely said to only expand, not decrease. Although it is not possible to have a uniform specification for planting density, there is a basic experience that can be affirmed, that is, it should not be too sparse or too dense. Communes and production teams in various places should determine the degree of reasonable close planting based on the specific conditions in different regions and retain sufficient seeds. From seed retention to sowing, some new problems will also occur. It may be necessary to change the sowing time or change the originally planned sowing varieties due to climate reasons. It may also be necessary to replant or re-sow due to poor soil moisture and weak or uneven wheat seedlings after sowing. In short, in order to prevent natural disasters or changes in production plans, some reserve seeds should also be retained.
Storing seeds is also a very important task. Every commune must separate varieties during the summer harvest, harvest and thresh them separately, store them in special warehouses, designate special personnel to manage them, and inspect and turn them over regularly to ensure quality.
Attention must be paid to the selection and cultivation of new varieties. In order to develop agricultural production, it is necessary to cultivate more new varieties with large ears, many grains, heavy grains, more fertilizer tolerance, and strong stress resistance. During the summer harvest, various places should widely mobilize experienced members and agricultural scientific researchers to select excellent single ears and single plants, and then cultivate new varieties from them. Selecting and breeding new varieties is a relatively meticulous and scientific and technical work, and there must be clear goals and specific arrangements. During the selection and breeding process, repeated observation and comparison should be made. The "Selection of 100 Ears and Selection of 100 Grains" movement launched in some places last year also collected many excellent single ears, but because they were not well classified, mastered, and organized by variety, the expected results were not achieved. This year, this should be improved.
To do a good job in this year's summer harvest crop seed selection and retention work and seed storage work, it is first required that leaders at all levels pay sufficient attention to it, especially strengthening the leadership in areas with weak seed selection foundations, so that every commune selects seeds and every team retains seeds. In terms of labor arrangements, communes that have established specialized seed organizations should rely on these organizations to carry out seed selection and retention work. This clarifies responsibilities and can guarantee quantity and quality. Communes that do not have specialized seed organizations can form temporary seed selection teams (groups) according to the situation, and try to use semi-laborers to participate in this work. Since seed selection work is highly technical, there should be one or two backbones with seed selection experience in each seed selection team (group) to be responsible for technical guidance to ensure seed selection quality.
The summer harvest has already begun. In order to strive for a greater harvest of summer crops in 1960, it is hoped that all localities will quickly grasp seed selection and retention work!

### 抓紧选种和留种工作

    抓紧选种和留种工作
    夏收作物的选种、留种，是夏收中的一项重要工作。从已经选种、留种地区的情况来看，今年一般地都作到了留种数量充足，选种质量较好，有的还多留了一部分后备种子，为今年秋冬播种工作打下了良好基础。但是也有一些地方的选种、留种工作，只停留在一般号召上，没有落实到社、队；或者虽然已经布置到社、队，但是没有作出具体安排；或者有些社、队虽然已经注意选种、留种，但是有重数量轻质量的现象。这些，对今年秋冬播种和明年丰收，都是不利的。
    这是什么原因呢？是没有好的品种可选吗？不是。据农业科学机关调查，全国农家品种极为丰富，已经搜集到的就有十八万份，其中小麦就有一万多份。这些品种各有自己的特点、长处，只要认真地观察、评比，就可以从中选出一部分适合当地生产需要的良种。是社、队不愿意做这一工作吗？也不是，农民们都知道：“一颗良种，千粒好粮”，他们是愿意选留好种的。那么为什么呢？主要是有一部分人认为良种已经普及，用不着再年年选种；或者认为许多人民公社已经建立了种子工作的专业组织，领导上不必再去操心选种、留种的工作了；或者认为夏收季节劳力十分紧张，选种留种工作不能同夏收夏种同时进行。追根到底，这仍然是个思想问题，特别是干部的思想问题。
    是的，近几年来的选种工作有很大发展，在争取农业丰收中起了不小作用。但是选种、留种工作是一个长期的工作而且也需要不断发展的。一方面农业生产不断地发展，对种子的要求也不断地提高，密植前后对种子的要求就不同。因此，选种、留种工作，只能愈做愈细致，不能愈做愈粗糙。另一方面，种子本身也是在变化着，在精心培育之下，可以愈变愈好，在一般管理的情况下，就要变坏。据四川省南部县四年来对“南大2419”小麦良种培育情况调查：1956年田间纯度是92％—93％，1957年降低到89％，1958年又降低到84％，1959年只有80％左右。这个例子说明即使在良种已经普及的地区，为了保持和不断提高良种的增产效果，选种仍然是一个不容忽视的措施。许多人民公社虽然都有了种子工作的专业组织，但是仍然需要领导，领导跟不上去，专业组织也不能起到应有的作用。现在有些社、队选种时只注意数量，不注意质量，就因为缺乏强有力的领导。夏收夏种需要付出大量的劳动，这是一个现实问题，但是只要安排合理，劳力紧张问题是可以解决的。以四川省合川县南屏公社中南大队为例，这个队本来也有些社员认为劳力紧张，选种没法进行。经过算劳力账以后，这个队除了完成夏收夏种以外，每个生产队抽调了八人到十人专门负责种子的选、晒、收、打、藏工作。
      “母大儿肥”，这是每个农民都知道的谚语，所以选种时，首先要注意种子的质量。种子质量的好坏，同明年是否能够获得丰收有着密切的关系。质量好的种子，播种后苗全、苗旺、苗壮。在这个基础上，再加上周到的细致的田间管理工作，明年的夏收作物就可以获得丰收。其次，要注意穗选，已建立种子地的，应进行田间检验，去杂去劣；没有建立种子地的，可以结合丰产评比，产量调查，选择纯度较高、生长整齐、病虫害少的地块进行去杂去劣留作种用。
    至于种子留多留少，是同明年夏收作物的播种面积和密植规格有着密切的关系。明年夏收作物播种面积，现在可以肯定地说，只会扩大，不会减少。而播种密度，现在虽然不可能有一个统一的规格，但是有一条基本经验是可以肯定的，就是不可太稀，不可太密。各地公社和生产队应当根据不同地区的具体条件确定合理密植的程度，留足必需的种子。从留种到播种，还会发生一些新的问题。可能因为气候关系，不得不改变播种时间，或者改变原来计划播种的品种；又可能因为墒情不好，播种以后麦苗不壮、不齐，需要补种或重种。总之，为了预防自然灾害或生产计划变更，也应该多留一部分后备种子。
    保管种子也是一项很重要的工作。每一个公社在夏收中一定要分别品种、单收单打、专仓贮存，指定专人保管、定期检查、翻晒，以保证质量。
    对于挑选和培育新的品种的工作，必须注意。为了发展农业生产，就需要培育更多的穗大、粒多、粒重、更耐肥、抗逆力强的新品种。在夏收工作中各地应广泛发动有经验的社员和农业科学研究人员选拔优良的单穗、单株，然后从中培育出新的品种。选育新品种是一件比较细致和带有科学技术性的工作，必须有明确的目的，具体的安排，在选育过程中，应当反复地观察比较。去年有些地方发动的“选百穗选百粒”运动，也搜集了不少的优良单穗，但是由于没有很好的分别品种掌握、整理，以致没有收到预期的效果，今年应该改进。
    要作好今年的夏收作物选种留种工作和种子保管工作，首先要求各级领导予以足够的重视，特别要加强选种基础薄弱的地区的领导，做到社社选种、队队留种。在劳动力的安排上，已成立种子专业组织的公社，应该依靠专业组织来进行选种留种工作。这样责任明确，可以保证数量、质量。没有种子专业组织的公社，可以根据情况组成临时选种专业队（组），并尽量利用半劳动力，参加这项工作。由于选种工作技术性较高，在每一个选种队（组）中，都应当有一两个有选种经验的骨干，负责技术指导，以保证选种质量。
    夏收已经开始了，为了争取1960年夏季作物更大的丰收，希望各地把选种、留种工作迅速地抓起来！
