Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st: The hundred-mu wheat high-yield plot of the Pingle Production Brigade of the Pingle People's Commune in Mengjin County, Henan Province, has broken through the 1,000 jin per mu mark. After threshing and drying the 102 mu of wheat, the actual harvest was 100,423.5 jin, averaging 1,021 jin and 15 liang per mu.

Reasonable close planting, corresponding fertilization, and good coordination of various measures are the main experiences for obtaining high yields in this high-yield plot. The land was deep-plowed by tractor to a depth of 1.2 chi, which is 4 to 5 cun deeper than in previous years. Based on the close planting experience of 1958, except for the six mu of experimental fields, 28 to 30 jin were sown per mu. Fertilization was also increased compared to previous years, with 18,000 jin of coarse manure, 200 jin of cottonseed oil cake, and six nitrogen-fixing bacteria bricks applied per mu, and six top dressings. In terms of top dressing methods, they adopted methods such as early accumulation and early application, accumulation and application simultaneously, careful application of coarse fertilizer, skillful application of chemical fertilizer, and strip and hole application of chemical fertilizer and human manure. They also decided whether to irrigate based on the soil moisture content, generally maintaining the soil moisture content at around 25%.

The field management of the hundred-mu high-yield plot was very meticulous. They established specialized teams, implemented dedicated management by specific personnel, and successively conducted eight investigations and comparisons of various wheat fields, and promptly strengthened the management of wheat fields with poorer growth conditions.

After the wheat in the hundred-mu high-yield plot was harvested, it was placed separately in a field. After threshing and drying, it was inspected and accepted by Wei Nairu, First Secretary of the Mengjin County Party Committee, and more than 30 other people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st: The Guozhuang Production Team of the Guozhuang People's Commune in Gaocheng County, which achieved a high wheat yield last year, has again achieved a high yield on a wheat high-yield plot cultivated this year. This high-yield plot, totaling 16 mu, 9 fen, 4 li, and 7 hao, harvested 18,943.8 jin of wheat, averaging 1,117 jin and 12 liang per mu. The Gaocheng County Party Committee conducted a meticulous inspection and acceptance of this wheat from harvesting to weighing.

The Guozhuang Production Team carefully managed this wheat plot starting last autumn. The land was deep-plowed before sowing, and the seeds were soaked in warm water and treated with pesticides. They also achieved reasonable close planting, with an average sowing rate of about 40 jin per mu.

The Guozhuang Production Team paid special attention to preventing wheat lodging. Before the wheat jointing stage, they reduced watering, properly suppressed seedling growth, controlled excessive growth of wheat seedlings, and applied lime to increase stem hardness and strengthen wind resistance. These measures played a significant role in preventing wheat lodging.

    孟津平乐公社一百零二亩亩产超过一千
    ?城郭庄公社十六亩丰产方亩产一千一
    据新华社郑州21日电　河南省孟津县平乐人民公社平乐生产大队的百亩小麦丰产方，突破了亩产千斤关。一百零二亩小麦打场以后，晒干扬净，实收麦子十万零四千二百三十九斤半，平均亩产一千零二十一斤十五两。
    合理密植、相应地施肥、各项措施配合好，是这块丰产方获得高产的主要经验。这块地是用拖拉机深耕一尺二寸，比往年深耕四寸到五寸。并根据1958年的密植经验，除六亩试验田外，每亩播种二十八斤到三十斤。施肥也比往年增加，每亩施一万八千斤粗肥、二百斤棉油饼和六个固氮菌砖，追肥六次。在追肥方法上，他们采取了早积早施、边积边施、粗肥细施、化肥巧施、化肥和人粪尿条施穴施等办法，还根据土壤含水量多少来决定是否浇水，一般地保持土壤含水量在25％左右。
    百亩丰产方的田间管理工作非常细致。他们成立了专业组，实行专人专管，并先后八次调查评比了各类麦田，及时加强了生长情况较差的麦田的管理。
    百亩丰产方的小麦收割后，单独放在一个场。打场晒干以后，经过中共孟津县委第一书记卫乃如等三十多人验收。
    据新华社天津21日电　去年获得小麦丰产的藁城县郭庄人民公社郭庄生产队，今年培植的一块小麦丰产方，又获得高额丰产。这块丰产方共十六亩九分四厘七，收获小麦一万八千九百四十三斤八两，平均亩产一千一百一十七斤十二两。中共藁城县委对这块小麦从收割到过秤，做了细致的验收工作。
    郭庄生产队从去年秋天起，精心管理这块小麦。下种前土地进行了深耕，用温水浸种和药剂拌种。并且做到合理密植，每亩平均播种四十斤左右。
    郭庄生产队特别注意预防小麦倒伏，在小麦拔节前少浇水、适当蹲苗，控制麦苗陡长，并且追施石灰，增加麦茎硬度，加强抗风能力。这些措施对预防小麦倒伏起了很大作用。
