This newspaper, Hangzhou, June 25th: The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held an industrial symposium to deploy the industrial production tasks for June, July, and August. It was decided to continue to deepen the increase production and practice economy movement, focusing on improving quality, throughout the province, and to actively consolidate industrial and mining enterprises during this movement.

After affirming the tremendous achievements in industrial production and construction during the first five months of this year, the meeting, based on the nature and tasks of local industry in the province, studied how to further correctly realize the tasks of local industry. The meeting made it clear that local industry should serve agriculture, serve national large-scale industry, serve the lives of urban and rural people, and serve exports. The primary task at present is to serve agricultural production and the lives of urban and rural people, and it should also be conducive to the development of national industry. According to Zhejiang's industrial base and resource conditions, the basic requirements for Zhejiang's development of local industry in the future are to "lay the foundation and train the troops" for several new industries. In terms of industrial layout and enterprise consolidation, it is necessary to implement "unified division of labor, coordinated fixed-point production." "Laying the foundation and training the troops" mainly refers to laying the foundation and passing the technical hurdles in heavy industries such as metallurgy, mining, machinery, electricity, and chemical industry, as well as newly built industries. "Unified division of labor, coordinated fixed-point production" refers to reasonable layout, appropriate division of labor, and close cooperation under the unified leadership of the central government, in accordance with the national plan and the development of work in various regions.

The meeting believes that the central link of the increase production and practice economy movement is to improve the quality of products and projects. To improve quality, it is first necessary to improve the ideological understanding of cadres and workers. Educate cadres and workers to overcome one-sided ideas such as "high quality cannot achieve high output" and "output value first, quality second," and establish a comprehensive view of more, faster, better, and more economical. The basic measure to improve product quality is to actively improve enterprise management.

The meeting pointed out that strengthening the leadership of handicrafts and small commodity production, and conscientiously organizing the production of small commodities and handicrafts, is a major task in the current increase production and practice economy movement. Leaders at all levels must immediately pay high attention to this, make careful arrangements, and strive for rapid results. To this end, it is first necessary to earnestly solve the problems of production, supply, and sales. Planning departments at all levels should arrange production tasks for small commodities and handicrafts, and the required raw materials should be included in the plan and guaranteed supply. Handicraft management departments at all levels should establish supply and marketing management departments to assist planning and commercial departments in arranging the supply of raw materials and sales of products for small commodity and handicraft production. All enterprises should make full use of local resources, and link up with large factories and construction departments, utilizing their offcuts and waste materials, vigorously recycle waste products, and make every effort to solve the supply of raw materials. Commercial departments at all levels should strengthen the management of raw material and product prices, and actively organize purchases to promote the increase in production of small commodities and handicrafts. Second, adjust the industrial production layout appropriately in accordance with the principle of giving equal importance to heavy industry and light industry. Further strengthen and expand small commodity production; technical workers and craftsmen who originally engaged in small commodity and handicraft production but have now switched careers should be quickly returned to their posts if they are able to. All traditional products that have been discontinued must be restored within a specified time. At the same time, the wage issue of handicraft workers must be properly handled to mobilize their enthusiasm. Third, quickly establish and replenish handicraft management agencies at all levels and their affiliated supply and marketing management departments, and establish and replenish urban organizations to strengthen the leadership of handicraft production.

The meeting believes that June, July, and August are extremely critical periods for completing the annual industrial production and construction plan. Party organizations at all levels throughout the province must concentrate their efforts and vigorously grasp the increase production and practice economy movement with improving quality as the central link. In the movement, it is necessary to implement the principle of combining centralized leadership with vigorously launching mass movements, both mobilizing the masses to expose the problems existing in enterprises and relying on the masses to correctly solve these problems, vigorously establish the leadership style of the mass line, vigorously establish the idea of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and vigorously establish the necessary rules and regulations. In specific practices, we must be good at grasping the key concrete links in each period, having a center in each period, breaking and establishing in each problem, and making thorough and in-depth efforts.

    更好地发挥地方工业的作用
    中共浙江省委讨论地方工业的方针和任务
    要求目前尽快地扩大小商品和手工业品的生产
    本报杭州25日电　中共浙江省委最近召开工业座谈会，部署了6、7、8月份的工业生产任务，决定在全省继续深入开展以提高质量为中心环节的增产节约运动，并在这一运动中，积极整顿工矿企业。
    会议在肯定了今年头五个月来工业生产建设的巨大成就以后，根据本省地方工业的性质和任务，研究了怎样进一步正确实现地方工业的任务问题。会议明确指出：地方工业应当为农业服务，为国家大工业服务，为城乡人民生活服务，为出口服务。当前首要任务是为农业生产和城乡人民生活服务，并且要有利于国家工业的发展。根据浙江的工业基础和资源条件，今后一定时期内浙江发展地方工业的基本要求，是对若干新工业“打下基础练好兵”。在工业布局和整顿企业方面，必须实行“统一分工，协作定点”。“打下基础练好兵”主要是在冶金、采掘、机械、电力、化工等重工业和新建工业方面，打下基础，过好技术关。“统一分工，协作定点”，是指在中央的统一领导下，按照国家计划和各地区工作的发展，合理布局，适当分工，密切协作。
    会议认为：增产节约运动的中心环节是提高产品和工程的质量。要提高质量，首先要提高干部、工人的思想认识。教育干部和工人克服“优质不能高产”、“产值第一、质量第二”等片面思想，树立多、快、好、省的全面观点。提高产品质量的基本措施，是积极改进企业管理。
    会议指出，加强对手工业和小商品生产的领导，认真组织小商品和手工业品的生产，是当前增产节约运动中的一项重大任务。各级领导必须立即引起高度重视，认真安排，力求尽快见效。为此，首先要认真解决产、供、销的问题。各级计划部门都要安排小商品和手工业品的生产任务，所需原材料应当列入计划，保证供应。各级手工业管理部门应建立供销经理部，协助计划和商业部门安排小商品和手工业品生产的原材料供应和产品销售。各个企业应当充分利用地方资源，并且和大厂、建筑部门挂钩，利用它们的边料、废料，大力回收废品，千方百计解决原材料的供应问题。各级商业部门应当加强对原料和产品价格的管理，并且积极组织采购，促进小商品和手工业品的增产。第二，根据重工业和轻工业并举的方针，适当地调整工业生产布局。进一步加强和扩大小商品生产；原来从事小商品和手工业生产而现在转业的技术工人和手工业者，凡是能够归队的，要迅速归队。停产的一切传统产品必须限期恢复。同时，要妥善处理手工业工人的工资问题，以调动他们的积极性。第三，迅速建立和充实各级手工业管理机构及其所属的供销经理部门，建立和充实城镇组织，以加强手工业生产的领导。
    会议认为，6、7、8月份是完成全年工业生产建设计划的极关重要的时期。全省各级党组织，必须集中力量，大抓以提高质量为中心环节的增产节约运动。在运动中，必须贯彻集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，既要发动群众揭露企业中存在的问题，又要依靠群众正确地解决这些问题，大立群众路线的领导作风，大立勤俭办企业的思想和大立必要的规章制度。在具体做法上，要善于抓住每个时期关键性的具体环节，一个时期有一个中心，每个问题都有破有立，搞深搞透。
