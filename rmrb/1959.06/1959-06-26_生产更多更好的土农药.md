Producing More and Better Indigenous Pesticides
Commentator of this newspaper

The work of collecting and manufacturing indigenous pesticides has been widely carried out. Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Yunnan and other provinces have used a large number of indigenous pesticides in the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests of small spring crops such as wheat and rapeseed, and have achieved great benefits. In many areas, collecting indigenous pesticides has become a mass activity, and good methods have been created. For example, Santai County in Sichuan Province launched the "One Handful of Grass Movement Per Person Per Day", with commune members collecting indigenous pesticides on their way to and from work, and students collecting them on their way to and from school. They also combined it with manure accumulation, collecting a large number of weeds and leaves, selecting various indigenous pesticides, Chinese medicinal materials, and fodder, and using the rest for composting, making the most of everything without any waste. As early as mid-April this year, the county had produced and used more than 38 million catties of indigenous pesticides. These situations show that the work of collecting indigenous pesticides this year started earlier and has been done more meticulously than last year.

Does this mean that the current indigenous pesticide work has been done very well? No. Except for a few areas that have done a better job, the quantity of indigenous pesticides collected and manufactured in general areas is not large enough, and the quality is not good enough. Some people do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of vigorously developing indigenous pesticides, and in some places, technical guidance is not keeping up.

Some people say: The collection and manufacturing of indigenous pesticides is labor-intensive and time-consuming, the dosage is large, the duration of effectiveness is short, and the effect is not high. Although they also engage in some indigenous pesticides, they do not have much confidence and enthusiasm. It should be admitted that, compared with chemical pesticides, some indigenous pesticides are indeed inferior. However, the current problem is that chemical pesticides are insufficient. Then, should we watch insects eat crops? Or should we use every possible means to snatch crops from the mouths of insects? The correct approach should be to strive to improve the effectiveness of indigenous pesticides; before better indigenous pesticides are found, even if they only have 80%, 60%, or even 40% of the effect, they should be used. Prevention is always better than no prevention. Several more treatments can also solve the problem. Last year, Santai County treated 3 million mu of crops for pests, of which 2.3 million mu were treated with indigenous pesticides. Compared with those that were not treated, the yield was obviously different. It is estimated that more than 50 million catties of grain and 800,000 catties of cotton were harvested due to pest control. This is an obvious fact. Moreover, plant-based indigenous pesticides generally do not cause phytotoxicity to crops and also have a fertilizing effect, which is also a major advantage.

Some areas are truly blessed with relatively more indigenous pesticides that can be collected, and it is relatively easy to collect them; some places are indeed more difficult. However, by relying on the masses and finding more tricks, many indigenous pesticides that have not been discovered or widely used in the past can often be found. Indigenous pesticides in various parts of our country are rich and colorful, in addition to plant-based ones, there are also animal-based and mineral-based indigenous pesticides, as well as antibiotic fertilizers. This year, when many areas were preventing and controlling wheat crop diseases and insect pests, cow urine, human urine, lime, plant ash, and fishy fish water were all used together, and good results were achieved. Tangqiao People's Commune in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, is a plain with no wasteland at all; can indigenous pesticides be found? This spring, after widely mobilizing the masses, they found 25 kinds of indigenous pesticides for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests and collected and manufactured more than 90,000 catties in just half a month. Changshu County, located on the southern Jiangsu Plain, can do this, and many other regions should also be able to do it.

For the reasons why indigenous pesticides are not effective, we should analyze them carefully to see whether the indigenous pesticides themselves are not good or whether they are not used properly. Only certain medicines are effective against certain diseases and insect pests. Therefore, when collecting and manufacturing indigenous pesticides, it is necessary to collect and manufacture them in a planned way according to local medicinal sources and the types of diseases and insect pests that occur, and use them in a planned way to ensure that the right medicine is used for the right disease. Doing so can give us a clear understanding and avoid some unnecessary "eight-in-one" and "ten-in-one" mixtures, and save manpower. It is also necessary to know that the content of toxic components in plant-based indigenous pesticides varies depending on the growth and development period and different parts. Some stems, leaves, and roots are toxic, while others are toxic in flowers and fruits; some have high toxic content when they are young, while others are more toxic when they are older. This requires a good investigation and research. There are also tricks in the method of manufacturing indigenous pesticides. Some indigenous pesticides can only be squeezed and soaked, some can be boiled, some can be stored for a longer period of time, and some will lose their effectiveness if stored for a long time. For example, garlic can only be squeezed, and some places boil it into mature water to prevent diseases, and the effect is of course not good. After tobacco water is made, if it is not used for a few days, its effective component, nicotine, will all volatilize. In terms of application time, it is also necessary to grasp the pest situation, treat early, and treat small; otherwise, the insect body will grow larger, the drug resistance will be enhanced, and the prevention and control effect will of course be worse. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to improve the quality of indigenous pesticides, and on the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance, and full attention must be paid to both aspects at the same time. We must adhere to the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and experimenting with everything. Indigenous pesticides that have not been tested in the field should not be blindly promoted in large quantities, so as to avoid waste and shake the confidence of the masses in using indigenous pesticides.

Finally, let's talk about the issue of indigenous implements. In 1958, the masses invented many economical, durable, and highly efficient insect control implements. Localities should organize evaluations and determine models. Good and effective ones should be vigorously promoted; those that have been damaged should be repaired as soon as possible. The relationship between implements and medicines is like that between guns and bullets, and the two cannot be neglected.

Now is the season when wild plants are lush and the sources of indigenous pesticides are most abundant, and it is also a critical period for the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests. At present, the field management of various crops such as rice, miscellaneous grains, and cotton is of paramount importance to this year's agricultural production. And getting through the pest and disease barrier is a prominent issue among them. It is hoped that localities, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, will properly arrange labor and vigorously develop indigenous pesticides and indigenous implements in order to overcome diseases and insect pests and ensure a great agricultural harvest.

    生产更多更好的土农药

    采集和制造土农药的工作已经广泛地开展起来了。湖南、湖北、安徽、江苏、四川、云南等省在小麦、油菜等小春作物的病虫防治上，大量使用了土农药，收到很大的效益。在不少地区，采集土农药已经成为群众性的活动，并且创造了很好的方法。如四川省三台县开展了“每人每天一把草运动”，社员上工、下工，学生上学、放学，随路采集土农药。他们还结合积肥，大量收集野草、树叶，分别选出各种土农药、中药材、饲草，其余的全部沤肥，使物尽其用，一点也不浪费。早在今年4月中旬，这个县就已经生产和使用了土农药三千八百多万斤。这些情况说明，今年采集土农药的工作比去年动手早，做得也比较细致。
    这是不是说，目前土农药工作已经做得很好了呢？不是的。除少数地区做的较好以外，一般地区采集和制造土农药的数量不够多，质量也不够好。有些人对大搞土农药的意义认识不足，有些地方技术指导跟不上。
    有些人说：土农药采集制造费工、费时，用量大，药效维持时间短，效果不高。他们虽然也多少搞一些土农药，但是信心和劲头都不大。应当承认，同化学农药比起来，对于某些土农药来说，确是差些。但是，目前的问题是化学农药不足。那末，是看着虫子吃庄稼呢？还是用尽一切办法从虫子口内夺庄稼？正确的做法应该是力求提高土农药的药效；在更好的土农药没有找到以前，即使只有80％、60％甚至40％的效果，也要使用。防治总比不防治好。多治几遍，也可以解决问题。三台县去年治虫面积三百万亩次，其中有二百三十万亩次是用土农药防治的。经过防治的同未经防治的相比，产量显然不同。计算起来，因治虫而多收粮食五千余万斤，棉花八十万斤。这就是明摆着的事实。再说，植物性土农药一般对庄稼没有药害，还有肥田作用，这也是它的一大好处。
    有些地区真是得天独厚，可采集的土农药比较多，采集起来比较省事；有些地方确实是困难些。但是，依靠群众，多找窍门，往往能发现许多过去没有发现或者没有广泛利用的土农药。我国各地的土农药是丰富多采的，除了植物性的以外，还有动物性、矿物性的土农药，还有抗生菌肥料。今年许多地区在防治小麦作物病虫的时候，牛尿、人尿、石灰、草木灰、腥鱼水一齐上了阵，取得很好的效果。江苏常熟县的塘桥人民公社是一片平原，根本没有荒地；能不能找到土农药呢？今年春天，他们广泛发动群众以后，仅仅半个月时间，就找到防治病虫害的土农药二十五种，采集制造了九万多斤。位于苏南平原上的常熟县能够做到这样，别的许多地区也应当是可以做到的。
    对于土农药效果不好的原因，要好好分析一下，看看究竟是土农药本身不好，还是用之不得其法。对付某些病虫，只有某几味药有效。因此，在采集制造土农药时，要根据当地药源、发生病虫的种类，有计划地采集制造，有计划地使用，做到对症下药。这样做，可以心中有数，避免一些不必要的“八合剂”“十合剂”，可以节省人力。还要知道，植物性土农药，其生长发育时期，不同部位的含毒成分是不同的。有的茎、叶、根上有毒，有的花、果上有毒；有的幼嫩时含毒量大，有的越老越有毒。这就需要好好调查研究一番。在制造土农药的方法上也有讲究。有些土农药只能压榨浸泡，有些可以熬煮，有些可以较长期的储存，有些久放就会失效。例如：大蒜是只能压榨的，有些地方把它熬成熟水来防病，效果当然不好。烟草水做成后，如果放几天不用，其有效成分尼古丁就全部挥发了。在施用时间上，也要掌握虫情，治早、治小；否则，虫体长大，抗药能力增强，防治效果当然要差些。因此，一方面要提高土农药质量，另方面要加强技术指导，对两方面必须同时充分重视。要坚持放手发动群众，一切经过试验的方针，凡是没有经过实地考验的土农药，不要盲目地大量推广，以免造成浪费，动摇群众使用土农药的信心。
    最后，再来谈一谈土器械问题。1958年群众发明创造的经济、耐用、效率较高的治虫器械很多。各地应当组织评比，确定型号。好的、有效的，要大力推广；已经损坏的，要及早修理，械和药的关系等于枪和弹，二者是不能偏废的。
    现在正是野生植物丛生、土农药药源最丰富的季节，也是防治农作物病虫害的关键时期。目前水稻、杂粮、棉花等多种作物的田间管理工作，对今年的农业生产具有头等重要的意义。而过好病虫关是其中的突出问题。希望各地在党委统一领导下，妥善安排劳力，大搞土农药、土器械，以便战胜病虫害，确保农业大丰收。
