Xinhua News Agency, Durban, June 25th: A group of African women in the Glebe Lands (an African residential area) on the outskirts of Durban, South Africa, were suppressed by police this morning for taking demonstration action to resist three municipal buses.

According to a police officer in charge, the police arrested twenty-three demonstrators in this crackdown.

The situation is also tense in other cities of the Federation of South Africa. The police are prepared to suppress any possible demonstrations by Africans against the system of racial discrimination at any time. The South African African National Congress has called on South African Africans to boycott enterprises and companies that support the white government from the 26th, and to hold mass rallies on the 28th to protest the authorities' racial discrimination policies.

    德班非洲人再示威
    新华社25日讯　德班消息：南非德班市郊格累布兰兹（非洲人居住区），今天早晨有一群非洲妇女因为采取示威行动抵制三辆市府的公共汽车而遭到警察的镇压。
    据一名负责警官宣布，警察在这次镇压中逮捕了二十三名示威者。
    南非联邦其他城市，局势也很紧张。警察准备随时镇压可能发生的非洲人反抗种族歧视制度的示威。南非非洲人国民大会曾号召南非非洲人从26日起开始对支持白人政府的企业和公司实行抵制，并在28日举行群众集会抗议当局的种族歧视政策。
