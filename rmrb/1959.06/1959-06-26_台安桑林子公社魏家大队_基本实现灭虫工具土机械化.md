    According to the Liaoning Daily, in the summer hoeing and seedling protection campaign, the Weijia Brigade of the Sanglinzi People's Commune in Tai'an County, Liaoning Province, mobilized the masses to vigorously reform tools, basically realizing the indigenous mechanization of pest control tools.

    In order to save manpower and improve the effect of pest control, the Weijia Brigade Party Branch convened production team leaders, carpenters, and experienced farmers to discuss ways to improve the efficiency of pest control.  After discussion, they modified two axle-driven automatic spraying carts, and also sent carpenter Li Chengzhi to learn the technology of manufacturing axle-driven spraying carts, returning to create axle-driven spraying carts and oil-pressing spraying carts. These types of spraying carts were all modified from existing foot-operated sprayers.  Each spraying cart is operated by three people, spraying four rows at a time, and can spray 2.5 to 3 *xiang* of cotton per day, with a labor efficiency eight to ten times higher than that of manual spraying.

    Currently, this brigade has manufactured six spraying carts of four types.  In addition to the original three horse-drawn spraying carts and more than twenty compression sprayers, they have basically realized the indigenous mechanization of pest control tools. The brigade plans to rush to produce sixteen more oil-pressing sprayers in the near future to ensure the full realization of indigenous mechanization.

    台安桑林子公社魏家大队
    基本实现灭虫工具土机械化
    据辽宁日报报道　在夏锄保苗运动中，辽宁台安县桑林子公社魏家大队发动群众，大搞工具改革，基本实现了灭虫工具土机械化。
    为节省人力和提高治虫效果，魏家大队党支部召集各生产队长、木匠、老农座谈，研究提高治虫的工效。经过大家研究，改装了两台轮轴传导自动式打药车，又派木工李成志，出外学习制造轴转带动打药车的技术，回来制成了轴转带动式打药车和轧油式打药车。这几种打药车，都是用旧有的足立式喷雾器改装的，每台打药车用三人操纵，每次打四垅，每天可喷棉花二垧半至三垧地，劳动效率比原来用人工喷药提高八倍到十倍。
    目前，这个大队已经制成了四种喷雾车六台，加上原有三台马拉喷雾车、二十几台压缩式喷雾器，已基本实现了灭虫工具土机械化。这个大队计划最近再赶制十六台轧油式喷雾车，保证全面实现土机械化。
