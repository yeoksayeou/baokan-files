Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 15th: The Wuhan City Zhongshan Park Animal Taming Troupe is performing in Shanghai.

	The performance began with a majestic tiger pacing proudly around a young man within a spacious wire enclosure, its eyes gleaming like copper bells. The young man brandished a short, gleaming silver iron rod a few times, and the tiger immediately stopped and lay down. The young man raised his right leg, straddling the tiger's back, and inserted both his left and right hands along the sides of the tiger's mouth. After a while, he calmly withdrew his hands and kissed the tiger's mouth several times without panic. The entire audience erupted in applause and praise. The tiger tamer is named Jiang Kaifa. A year ago, he, like all the other performers in the circus, was a zookeeper who spent all day living with animals such as lions, tigers, leopards, and bears. Now he is a tiger tamer.

	All the performers in this circus were originally zookeepers at the zoo. Over the past year, they have gradually learned a lot of valuable animal training experience. They have a saying: "Audacious and careful." While raising these animals, the performers cared for and loved them like nannies, establishing a deep emotional connection with them. When the training work began, the performers slept with the animals in the cages, spending five or sixty days together, observing and studying their temperaments and psychological states. They used tools to touch the whiskers of the tigers and leopards, and put fake hands in the animals' mouths to test their reactions. Later, they used chairs to drive the tigers and leopards in circles, using the chairs to fend off any attacks. Once, Jiang Kaifa did not fully grasp the psychological changes of a female tiger during mating season. He had just climbed onto the tiger's back as it lay on the ground, when the tiger suddenly rolled over, grabbing his feet with its front paws. Jiang Kaifa shouted, and the tiger released its paws, allowing him to escape.

	Since the circus was founded, no one has been hurt except for the occasional tearing of clothes by the animals.

    胆大包天　细察秋毫
    武汉马戏团驯虎有方
    在上海演出受到观众称赞
    据新华社上海15日电　武汉市中山公园驯化动物巡回表演团在上海演出。
    表演开始了，一条威风凛凛的猛虎正围绕着一个青年在空阔的铁丝圈内傲然地踱着步子，闪着铜铃似的眼睛。那青年把手里那根银光闪闪的短铁棍比划了几下，老虎立即停住脚步，随即卧了下来。青年右腿一举，跨上虎背，左右手顺着虎的嘴角两边插了进去。待了一会，他安详地缩回双手，不慌不忙地把嘴对准虎口亲了几个吻。全场掌声雷动，赞声不绝。那位驯虎青年叫江开发，一年前他同这个马戏团的全体演员一样，都是整天和狮、虎、豹、熊等动物生活在一起的饲养员，现在是驯虎演员。
    这个马戏团的全部演员原是动物园的饲养员，一年来它们已一点一滴地摸索出不少难能可贵的驯兽经验。他们有一句话是：胆大包天，细察秋毫。在饲养这些动物期间，演员像保姆一样关切和疼爱它们，同它们建立了深厚的感情；开始驯化工作时，演员和动物隔着铁笼睡在一起，相处了五、六十天，观察和揣摸它们的脾性和心理状态。他们用工具触弄虎、豹的胡须，把假手塞在动物口里，试探它们的反应；以后手持靠背椅赶着虎豹兜圈，万一受到攻击，就用椅子顶住。有一次，江开发没有透彻掌握住动情期间雌虎的心理变化，他刚骑上卧在地上的虎背，冷不防老虎一个翻身，两只前爪抱住了他的双脚，江开发一声吆喝，虎爪一松，他才乘机逃开了。
    从这个马戏团成立以来，除了演员的衣服偶尔被动物抓破外，没有任何人受到过伤害。
