Grasp Production with One Hand, Grasp Life with the Other
Hunan Strengthens Leadership in Summer Production and Living
Hot food, fragrant dishes, convenient water usage, comfortable housing; commune members are happy and full of energy

Our newspaper Changsha, 20th – Party committees across Hunan Province are grasping production with one hand and life with the other, enabling the broad masses of peasants to be happy and full of energy in the battle to seize a bumper summer harvest and ensure overall abundance. In many places, they have already achieved hot food and fragrant dishes in the canteens, convenient access to boiled water and water for bathing and washing clothes, comfortable housing, and hats and straw hats to shield from the sun when working in the fields. At the same time, because all regions have universally emphasized epidemic prevention work, there have been very few summer infectious diseases in the province this year.

As early as mid-May, the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee issued a "Notice on Several Issues Concerning the Summer Life of the Masses," requiring all localities to grasp life well while grasping production. Specific arrangements were also made at various meetings recently held by the Provincial Committee. According to the Provincial Committee's instructions, Party committees in all localities promptly convened meetings for study and specific implementation. Generally, all localities designated a Party Secretary or committee member to specifically be responsible for arranging the summer life of the masses, and established and improved organizational structures at all levels to strengthen leadership. At the same time, responsible cadres from all localities also went deep into work groups and canteens, visiting door-to-door, chatting intimately with the masses, discovering problems, and solving them promptly. In this way, problems were solved quickly and well, and were very popular with commune members.

In arranging summer life, all localities relied on the masses and self-reliance to solve some specific difficulties in life. Shiwang Commune, Huilan Brigade, in Hengshan County, lacked vegetables. Huang Qiusheng, the Brigade General Branch Secretary, discovered this and immediately went to the production team to help organize a specialized team, raise seeds, accumulate fertilizer, and open up approximately one hundred mu of scattered land to grow vegetables. When there was a lack of materials for building melon sheds, the brigade immediately provided sixty yuan to buy more than two thousand melon shed poles from Mount Heng, and promptly built the melon sheds. Now the vegetables are growing very well, and all fourteen canteens in the brigade have enough vegetables to eat. The Third Canteen of Chengyi Brigade, Zhushi Commune, Lan Jia County, was far from a water source. In order to save labor and provide more hot water, commune members directly piped water into the pot for boiling, ensuring an adequate supply of hot water. At the same time, two earthen self-service water bathhouses were built, making it convenient for commune members to bathe and wash their faces. The canteen also specially built two water tank stoves for boiling water, which were fired twice a day, morning and evening, so that commune members could have boiled tea to drink whenever they went to work or returned home. All localities adopted methods such as using old houses, repairing and renovating them to properly arrange housing for the masses. In the seven counties of Hengyang Prefecture, these methods provided clean, airy, convenient, and comfortable houses for more than nine thousand households.

In order to help the masses improve their summer lives, industrial, commercial, and health departments vigorously provided support. The Dongting Lake area of Changde and Xiangtan Prefectures lacked firewood for fuel, so the Provincial Coal Industry Bureau promptly supplied more than 40,000 tons of coal for domestic use. As soon as summer arrived, the Changde Prefectural Department of Goods and Materials sent cadres to distant places to organize the supply of straw hats, and has now transported back more than 12,000 hats. Health departments in all localities, in conjunction with current production, trained cooks and health workers in disease prevention and treatment. Shao Yang Prefecture alone trained more than 230,000 people, and they carried out epidemic prevention and health work. Hanshou County selected 510 medical and health personnel to form 129 groups, which went deep into the fields and canteens to carry out mobile prevention and treatment.

The Party's meticulous concern for the lives of the masses greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the broad masses. The peasants are energetic and their enthusiasm has soared. They are expanding the area under cultivation, strengthening field management, resisting natural disasters, and striving for bumper harvests every season and overall abundance. Wang Jiyun, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Changsha County Committee and County Head, went to the Yangongbang canteen of the Fengjia Production Team in Fulin Commune. Finding that the commune members' houses were crowded, he discussed the matter with the commune members and decided to vacate a house near the canteen, originally used by the commune to store things, for the commune members to live in. The commune members then wrote a big-character poster: "The County Head personally goes to the canteen, and arranges life with ideas. Everyone is full of energy and will surely produce a thousand catties of grain per mu." The Huaxianglun Brigade of Changshou Commune in Yiyang appropriately reduced the size of overly large canteens to make it easier for the masses to eat. At the same time, the problem of overcrowded housing for commune members was solved. As a result, the attendance rate increased from a previous high of 70% to 73%, and the amount of grass pulled per person per day increased from 2.8 mu to 3 mu. Two hundred and fifty mu of rice paddies that were far from the canteen, making it inconvenient to accumulate and transport fertilizer, were all category three seedlings. Now, after a concentrated application of fertilizer, they have quickly caught up with category one and two seedlings.

    一手抓生产　一手抓生活
    湖南各地加强夏季生产生活领导 
    饭热菜香、用水方便、住房舒适，社员心情舒畅，干劲倍增
    本报长沙20日电　湖南省各地党委一手抓生产，一手抓生活，使广大农民在夺取夏季丰产，五谷丰登战斗中，心情舒畅，干劲更足。现在，已有许多地方做到了食堂里饭热菜香，喝开水和洗澡洗衣用水方便，住房舒适，出工在田间有斗笠、草帽遮太阳。同时，由于各地都普遍地重视了防疫工作，全省今年夏季传染病也很少发生。
    早在5月中旬，中共湖南省委就发出了“关于夏季群众生活几个问题的通知”，要求各地在抓生产的同时把生活抓好。在最近省委召开的各种会议上也都作了具体布置。根据省委的指示各地党委都及时地召开了会议进行研究，具体贯彻。各地一般都确定一个党委书记或委员具体负责安排群众的夏季生活，并且层层健全和建立组织机构，加强领导。同时各地负责干部还纷纷深入作业组和食堂，登门访问，和群众促膝谈心，发现问题，及时解决。这样，问题解决得就又快又好，很受社员欢迎。
    在安排夏季生活中，各地都是依靠群众，自力更生，解决生活上的一些具体困难。衡山石湾公社回拦大队缺少蔬菜，大队总支书记黄秋生发现以后，立即深入生产队帮助组织专业队，筹集种子，增积肥料，开辟了大约一百亩零星地种菜，搭瓜棚没有材料，大队马上支了六十元，从南岳买回了两千多根瓜棚叉秆，及时搭好了瓜棚。现在蔬菜长得很好，全大队十四个食堂都有足够的菜吃。蓝嘉县竹市公社成沂大队第三食堂离水源较远，为了节省劳力，有更多的热水供应，社员们便把水直接引到锅里烧，保证有足够的热水供应。同时建立了两个土自来水浴室，社员洗澡、洗脸都很方便。食堂里还专门打了两个烧水用的水缸灶，每天早晚各烧一次，使社员去工地和回家以后随时都能喝上烧开的茶水。各地采取利用旧房，修整改新的办法，对群众住房作了妥善安排，衡阳专区七个县通过这些办法就安排了九千多户住上了干干净净、空气流通，方便舒适的房子。
    为了帮助群众搞好夏季生活，工业、商业、卫生等部门大力进行了支援。常德、湘潭专区洞庭湖滨地区缺少柴草做燃料，省煤炭工业局便及时供应了四万多吨生活用煤。常德专署百货经理部暑天刚到就派出干部到远地组织草帽供应，现在已运回一万二千多顶。各地卫生部门结合当前生产，对炊事员和保健员进行了防治疾病的训练，单只邵阳专区就训练了二十三万多人，通过他们开展防疫卫生工作。汉寿县抽出五百一十名医药卫生人员，组成一百二十九个组，深入田间、食堂，开展了巡回预防和治疗。
    党对群众生活无微不至的关怀大大鼓舞了广大群众的生产积极性。农民们精力充沛，干劲激增，正在扩大耕地面积，加强田间管理，抗御自然灾害，力争季季丰收，五谷丰登。中共长沙县委常委、县长汪季云深入到福临公社冯家生产队的雁公塝食堂，发现社员房子住得较挤，就和社员一起研究，将食堂附近一间原来公社放东西的房子腾出来给社员住，社员便写了一张大字报：“县长亲自下食堂，安排生活出主张，人人个个鼓干劲，一定亩产千斤粮。”益阳长寿公社划香仑大队把过大的食堂适当划小，便利群众吃饭。同时解决社员住得过挤的问题，这样出勤率由原先最高70％提高到73％，每人每天扯草由原先的二亩八提高到三亩。原有二百五十亩稻田离食堂较远，积肥、运肥不方便，全部是三类禾，现在经过突击追肥，迅速赶上了一、二类禾。
