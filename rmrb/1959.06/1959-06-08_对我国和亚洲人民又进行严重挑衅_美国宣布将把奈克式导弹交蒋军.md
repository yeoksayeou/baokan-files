Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. According to a United Press International dispatch from Taipei on June 2nd, the head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, Daugherty, told the UPI reporter that all "Nike-Hercules" missile bases in Taiwan would be handed over to the Chiang Kai-shek clique by mid-August. Daugherty said that after August, Chiang's troops would be able to "fully use and control" these surface-to-air missiles handed over by the United States. He said that before Chiang's troops used these missiles for "any launch," the United States would receive "full explanation and notification."

This U.S. invading military commander said that more than half of the U.S. military "Nike-Hercules" missile battalion personnel stationed in Taiwan have already been transferred back to the United States. Their work has been taken over by Chiang's officers and soldiers and specialized personnel who have received training in Taiwan and the United States to operate these missiles. In addition, approximately 250 Chiang's officers and specialized personnel will return to Taiwan from the United States on July 1st to complete the entire task of taking over these missile bases from the United States.

The U.S. aggressors stepped up their armed provocations and created tension in the Taiwan area in August and September of last year, when they transported the Second Missile Battalion of the U.S. 71st Artillery Regiment, along with "Nike-Hercules" missiles, from Seattle, USA, to Taiwan. Now, while the United States is provoking a dangerous situation in Laos and intensifying the atmosphere of war in Southeast Asia, it has announced that it will hand over all the "Nike-Hercules" missiles transported by the U.S. military to Taiwan to Chiang's troops, and Chiang's troops "can completely use these missiles themselves." This is clearly another serious provocation by U.S. imperialism against the people of China and the people of Asia.

    对我国和亚洲人民又进行严重挑衅
    美国宣布将把奈克式导弹交蒋军
    新华社6日讯　据合众国际社台北2日消息，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长窦恩告诉该社记者说，美国在台湾的所有各个“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹基地将在8月中旬移交给蒋介石集团。窦恩说，蒋军在8月以后将可以“充分的使用和控制”这些美国交给他们的地对空导弹。他说，在蒋军使用这种导弹作“任何发射”之前，美国方面会获得“充分的说明和通知”。
    这个侵台美军将领说，原来驻台湾的美军“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹营的人员已经有一半以上调返美国。他们的工作已由在台湾和美国接受操纵这种导弹的训练的蒋军官兵和专门人员接替。另外，还有大约二百五十名蒋军军官和专门人员将在7月1日由美国回台湾完成从美方接管这些导弹基地的全部工作。
    美国侵略者是在去年8、9月间加紧武装挑衅制造台湾地区紧张局势的时候，从美国西雅图把美军七十一炮兵团第二导弹营携同“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹运往台湾去的。现在，美国在挑起老挝危险局势并且在东南亚加剧战争空气的同时，又宣布把美军运进台湾的“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹全部交给蒋军，蒋军“可以完全自行使用这些导弹”，这显然是美帝国主义对我国人民和亚洲人民又一次严重的挑衅。
