    Criticism of Writing Style

    Recently, we have received letters from readers criticizing the writing style of the newspaper. We are now publishing a few of them below. We believe the readers' criticisms are correct. We are willing to work with authors to improve the writing style in the newspaper.

                                        Editor

    Difficult Titles

    The People's Daily's front-page lead story on May 23rd had a three-line banner headline: "Millions of Farmers in Hunan Fight Continuous Rain to Rush Harvest and Replanting, South and North of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu, the Aroma of Wheat Intoxicates People, a Widespread Opening of Sickles to Harvest 'March Yellow,' on the Yunnan Plateau, Waves of Wheat Shine Golden, People of All Ethnic Groups Greet the New Wheat Harvest with Joy." These headlines are very long, difficult to read, and not easy to break down. Some parts are also perplexing. For example, what does "Fight Continuous Rain" mean? We hope to improve the writing of news headlines to make them concise and briefly highlight the content.

    Additionally, if the headline has too many characters, we suggest printing it with a space between sections or adding punctuation.

    Half Classical, Half Vernacular, Awkward to Read

    Newspapers are popular reading material for the masses. Articles should be easy to understand, concise, and focused on the central point. The same goes for headlines, which should not only be easy to understand but also highlight the theme of the article in a few words, so that people can immediately understand the main idea. Some headlines in the People's Daily are very well done. However, a headline on the fourth page on May 22nd for an international news item is perplexing. This headline has three lines: "What is the Background of France's Stubborn Attitude at the Foreign Ministers' Conference? Using France's Mouth to Speak West Germany's Proposals is to Seize Hegemony in Western Europe by Borrowing West Germany's Hand." This headline is difficult to understand; the use of some half-classical, half-vernacular words makes it awkward to read.

    Articles Should be Written Fluently

    The article "Judges and Human Traffickers" on the fifth page of the People's Daily on May 18th is only a few hundred words long, but there are several grammatical errors. For example:

    "Now Wagner painfully requested Skopas's automatic resignation on May 2nd and ordered his arrest and imprisonment, which was due to unavoidable difficulties." The passive form "arrested" was used where "to arrest" was needed, reversing the meaning.

    "Since Skopas took office, he has obtained huge income due to participating in the black market trading group activities that trafficked Greek babies." A superfluous "that" makes the meaning unclear.

    Although this is an occasional phenomenon, it is not good for such occasional phenomena to appear in the People's Daily.

    Making Simple Things Complicated

    After reading Wang Yanan's article "Fully Utilizing the Positive Role of the Law of Value in China's Socialist Economy" on May 15th, we feel that this article may have its unique aspects as a treatise. However, we found some parts of the article a bit incomprehensible and difficult to read. For example, "The role that the law of value may play in specific different economic conditions and in different situations does have differences in size, depth, and scope, but it does not seem to be 'a priori' strictly distinguished in advance in a way that is strong in one aspect and justified in another." We pondered the second half of this sentence for a long time but still could not guess the author's meaning. Also, "Of course, economic work is closely related to political and ideological work. For the convenience of explanation, we have abstracted political and ideological work away." Abstraction is the opposite of concrete. We guess that "abstracted away" means that this part of political and ideological work will not be discussed in detail. The meaning is not complicated originally, but the author has made it complicated. Everyone is responsible for paying attention to writing style. We hope that writers will pay attention to grammar and rhetoric, so that words can express meaning, sentences are fluent, and the meaning is accurate. At the same time, we ask the editors to pay close attention to this aspect.

    "Wheat Has Become a Foregone Conclusion"

    The People's Daily published a front-page headline on May 12th about Shanxi launching a late-stage wheat field management campaign. The first sentence of the news is: "The wheat-producing areas of Shanxi Province are vigorously dispelling the so-called 'wheat has become a foregone conclusion...' argument." The phrase "wheat has become a foregone conclusion" is grammatically incorrect. What kind of conclusion can wheat have? It is probably a mistake for "a bumper wheat harvest has become a foregone conclusion." Unfortunately, this kind of statement is not uncommon in the newspaper.

### 对文风的批评

    对文风的批评
    近来收到一些读者来信，对报纸的文风提出了批评。现在发表几封如后。我们认为读者的批评是对的。我们愿意同作者共同努力，改进报纸上的文风。
                                        编者
    难读的标题
    人民日报5月23日第一版头条新闻有三行通栏标题：“湖南百万农民奋战连阴雨抢收又抢种，江苏长江南北麦香醉倒人普遍开镰收割‘三月黄’，云南高原上麦浪金光闪闪各族人民喜笑颜开割新麦迎丰收”。这几行标题都很长，念起来很吃力，不易读断。有些地方也很费解。比如“奋战连阴雨”是什么意思？希望改进新闻标题的编写工作，要使标题概括简要地标出内容。
    另外，如果标题字数过多，建议隔开一格排印，或者加上标点。

    半文半白　读来别扭
    报纸是人民大众的通俗读物，文章要求通俗易懂，简明扼要，抓住中心。标题也一样，不但要通俗易懂，而且要用几个字就能突出文章的主题，使人一看就知道里面的主要意思。人民日报有些标题做得很好。但在5月22日第四版上有一条国际消息的标题，使人费解。这条标题共有三行：“法国在外长会议上的顽固态度是何背景，所以用法国的嘴讲西德的主张，乃假借西德的手夺西欧的霸权”。这标题很难懂；用的一些半文半白的词儿，读起来也很别扭。

    应当把文章写通顺
    人民日报5月18日第五版“法官与人口贩子”一文，只有几百字，可是语法毛病就有好几处。如：
    “现在瓦格纳忍痛于5月2日要求斯柯帕斯自动辞职，并且下令被捕入狱，是有不得已的苦衷的。”需要用“逮捕”的地方却用了被动式的“被捕”，把意思弄反了。
    “自从斯柯帕斯上任以来，由于参加了贩运希腊婴儿的黑市交易集团活动下他获得了巨大的收入。”一个多余的“下”字，把意思弄得不明不白。
    这虽然是偶见的现象，但是，让这种偶见的现象出现在人民日报上也是不好的。
          华东师范大学　王玉
    把话说复杂了
    我们读了5月15日王亚南写的“充分发挥价值规律在我国社会主义经济中的积极作用”一文，感到这篇文章作为专论可能有它独到的地方。但是我们对文章的某些地方，感到有点看不懂、读不通。例如，“价值规律在具体的不同经济条件下和在不同的场合可能发生的作用，确有大小，深浅和范围广狭的不同，但似乎并不是彼强此理地在事前就‘先验地’严格区分开来的。”这一句的下半句，我们捉摸了很久，还猜不透作者的意思。又如，“当然，经济工作是和政治思想工作密切联系着的。为了说明的便利，我们把政治思想工作抽象去了。”抽象是具体的对照。我们猜测，“抽象去了”是对政治思想工作这一部分不作具体的论述。本来意思并不复杂，不过作者把话说复杂了。注意文风，人人有责。希望作家们讲究语法词章，作到词能达意，语句通顺，含意确切。同时要求编辑同志对这方面要很好注意。

    “小麦已成定局”
    人民日报5月12日第一版头条刊载了山西开展麦田后期管理运动的消息。消息的头一句是：“山西省产麦区正在大力破除所谓‘小麦已成定局……’的论调”。这里的“小麦已成定局”是文理不通。小麦有什么定局、不定局呢？恐怕是小麦丰收已成定局之误。很遗憾，这类说法在报纸上并不是少见的。
