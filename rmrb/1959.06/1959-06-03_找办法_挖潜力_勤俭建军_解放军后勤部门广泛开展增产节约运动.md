Xinhua News Agency, 2nd June: The logistics front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is widely carrying out a movement to increase production and practice economy. All military factories, warehouses, hospitals, supply departments, and transportation units are finding ways to save money and tap the potential for increased production based on their respective business characteristics, implementing the policy of building the army through diligence and thrift.

Currently, all military factories in the army have launched a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy, with the aim of improving labor productivity and product quality. A certain military supplies factory stationed in Beijing, on the basis of overfulfilling its production tasks for the first four months of this year, has launched a new upsurge of technical innovation in which everyone participates and contributes ideas, promoting and adopting more than 40 innovation projects. This has led to new records of high output and high quality in various workshops during "Red May." A certain military factory in Wuhan, in its march towards mechanization and automation, put forward more than 2,170 rationalization proposals and inventions. After review by the factory, 88 of them were quickly adopted, greatly improving the quantity and quality of products, and saving the state more than 200,000 yuan in funds. All the employees of a certain auto repair factory in the Chengdu area were determined to "arm themselves." They used old materials to transform, newly manufacture, and assemble 690 pieces of machine tools, drilling machines, gantry planers, electric motors, and other mechanical equipment, initially changing the equipment and production outlook of the entire factory.

　　A Factory in Nanjing Clears Warehouses to Contribute Treasures,
　　Unearths Materials Worth More Than 100,000 Yuan

While vigorously engaging in technical innovation, various factories have also found ways to increase production and practice economy from all aspects by identifying problems, proposing measures, and carefully calculating accounts. After carefully calculating accounts, a workshop of a certain military supplies factory decided to reduce material consumption by 15%, which could save 21,500 yuan per month and free up seven workers to support fraternal workshops. After the second workshop studied ways to improve the utilization rate of raw materials, it saved the state 100,000 yuan. A certain factory stationed in Nanjing launched a "make the best use of everything, clear warehouses to contribute treasures" movement, clearing out materials worth more than 100,000 yuan. Many of these were urgently needed materials for production. In the past, some factories felt that there was a shortage of manpower, equipment, and materials for a long time. After tapping potential and carefully calculating accounts, these difficulties were initially solved, and production targets continued to rise.

All non-production departments in the army are also trying their best to make every piece of money and every item play its maximum effect, saving materials for the country. After the Logistics Department of the Navy put forward the target of saving 13,500 tons of fuel oil this year, all troops responded enthusiastically. Because the electromechanical department of a certain warship adjusted and refitted the machinery, achieving "four diligences" (diligent listening, touching, looking, and checking) and "three no leaks" (no leaks of water, steam, or oil), the amount of oil consumed per nautical mile was reduced by 46.1% compared with the standard amount. Various motor transport troops have recently summarized many experiences in saving fuel. Some have reduced fuel consumption by 20% to 30% compared with the supply standard through technical innovation, and some have widely opened up ways to save fuel, reducing fuel consumption by more than 10%. Driver Liu Haizun drove 203 kilometers with gasoline (25 liters) that was only enough to drive 100 kilometers according to the standard.

　　In 1958, the whole army saved grain
　　More than 16 million jin

Last year, the whole army saved more than 16 million jin of grain. In this movement, all troops are determined to save more grain. Many troops achieve "calculation, saving, technology, adjustment," not only being able to allocate rice according to the number of people and cook according to the number of mouths, but also cooking according to different tasks and different physical exertion of the troops, carefully calculating everywhere. They don't waste a single grain in details such as transportation, storage, rice washing, and even handling leftovers. The cooks of a certain artillery battalion of the Wuhan area troops also saved more than 800 jin of grain in the first four months of this year by adjusting and matching staple and non-staple foods, coarse and fine grains. In order to save coal, the logistics and cooking staff of all troops are vigorously transforming stoves and improving burning techniques. In the past, a certain regiment of the Shenyang area troops used an average of more than one jin of coal per person per day for cooking. After creating a "two-connected stove" and a water heater, more than four taels of coal per person per day was enough. After the "multi-eye return air stove" created by cook squad leader Meng Zhaolun was promoted in the army, many troops reduced the amount of coal used per person per day from one jin to three or two taels.

In the movement to increase production and practice economy, many warehouse keepers have proposed the initiative of "refreshing and repairing without hiring workers, not sending errands during the issuing season, and doing loading and unloading vehicles by ourselves." Jiang Sanhu, a keeper of a certain unit, led several shoemakers to repair horse harnesses, saving the country more than 500 yuan in a few days. While strengthening the management of medicines and equipment, various hospitals also widely launched activities to cherish and save every needle and thread. After implementing the measures of "repairing when clothing and equipment are broken, repairing small breaks in small ways, repairing large breaks in large ways, and turning waste products into usable products," the hospitals and sanatoriums directly under the logistics of the Beijing area troops received 89% less clothing than prescribed.

At present, the movement to increase production and practice economy on the logistics front of the entire army is being carried out in depth. The General Logistics Department of the PLA calls on all logistics personnel to carry forward the fine qualities of diligently serving the troops, to be brave in creation, to study tenaciously, to vigorously engage in technical innovation and inventions, to be not afraid of trouble, to not be afraid of hardship, to be thrifty and diligent, to carefully calculate, and to cherish every penny, every grain, every inch of cloth, and every piece of material of the people.

    找办法　挖潜力　勤俭建军
    解放军后勤部门广泛开展增产节约运动
    新华社2日讯　中国人民解放军后勤工作战线上广泛开展增产节约运动。各军工厂、仓库、医院、供给部门和运输部队都根据各自的业务特点，从各方面找节约办法，挖掘增产潜力，贯彻勤俭建军的方针。
    目前，全军各军工厂已经展开了轰轰烈烈的以提高劳动生产率和产品质量为目的的增产节约运动。驻北京的某军需工厂，在超额完成今年头四个月生产任务的基础上，掀起了人人动手、个个献策的技术革新新高潮，推广和采用了革新项目四十多个。使各个车间在“红五月”中不断出现高产优质的新纪录。武汉某军工厂，在向机械化、自动化进军中，提出合理化建议和发明创造两千一百七十多件。厂方经过审定，迅速采用了其中的八十八项后，大大提高了产品的数量和质量，为国家节约了二十多万元资金。成都地区部队汽车修理厂全体职工决心“自己武装自己”，他们利用旧料改制、新制和拼制成车床、钻床、龙门刨床、电动机等机械设备六百九十件，初步改变了整个工厂的装备和生产面貌。
  驻南京一工厂清仓献宝，
  清出价值十多万元的物资
    在大闹技术革新的同时，各个工厂还通过找问题、提措施、算细账等办法，从各方面挖掘增产节约的办法。某军需工厂一车间经算细账以后，决心降低材料消耗15％，每月能节约资金两万一千五百元，并且可以抽出七个劳动力支援兄弟车间。第二车间研究出提高原料利用率的办法后，为国家节约资金十万元。驻南京的某工厂，在运动中开展了“物尽其用，清仓献宝”运动，清理出价值达十余万元的物资。其中有不少是生产中急需的材料。过去，有些工厂长期感到人力、设备和材料不足，通过挖潜力、算细账后，初步解决了这些困难，生产指标不断上升。
    全军各个非生产部门也千方百计地使一财一物都能发挥最大的效能，为国家节约物资。海军后勤部提出今年节约油料一万三千五百吨的指标以后，各部队奋起响应。某军舰由于机电部门调整和改装了机械，作到“四勤”（勤听、勤摸、勤看、勤检查）、“三不漏”（不漏水、汽、油），每浬消耗油量比标准量降低了46.1％。各汽车运输部队，最近总结了许多节约油料的经验，他们有的通过技术革新，用油量比供给标准减少了20％到30％，有的广开省油门路，减少用油10％以上，司机刘海尊用按标准只够行驶一百公里用的汽油（二十五公升），行驶了二百零三公里，
    1958年全军节约粮食
      一千六百多万斤
    去年，全军节约粮食一千六百多万斤，这次运动中，各部队决心节约更多的粮食。许多部队作到
  “算、省、技、调”，不仅能按人下米、计口做饭，还根据部队执行不同的任务，不同的体力消耗做饭，处处精打细算。在调运、储藏、淘米，以至处理剩饭等细节上都作到颗粒不丢。武汉地区部队某炮兵营的炊事员还通过主副食品、粗细粮互相调剂、搭配等方法，在今年头四个月里，节约粮食八百多斤。为了节约煤炭，各部队给养、炊事人员都在大力改造炉灶，提高烧火技术。沈阳地区部队某团过去炊事用煤每人每天平均一斤多，创制了
  “二连灶”和烧水器以后，每人每天用煤四两多就够了。炊事班长孟照伦创造的“多眼回风灶”在部队推广后，使许多部队每人每天的用煤量由一斤减少到三两或二两。
    在增产节约运动中，许多仓库保管人员提出了“刷新修补不雇工，发放季节不派差，装卸车辆自己动手”的倡议。某部保管员姜三虎领导几个鞋工修理马挽具，十几天为国家省了五百多元。各个医院在加强医药、器械等管理的同时，也广泛展开了爱护、节约一针一线的活动。北京地区部队后勤直属医院、疗养院在贯彻被服装具“有破即补，小破小补，大破大补，变废品为有用品”的措施后，按规定少领了89％的被服。
    目前，全军后勤战线上的增产节约运动正在深入开展。解放军总后勤部号召全体后勤人员发扬勤勤恳恳为部队服务的优良品质，勇于创造、顽强钻研，大闹技术革新和发明创造，作到不怕麻烦，不辞劳苦，克勤克俭，精打细算，珍惜人民一分钱、一粒粮、一寸布、一件物资。（附图片）
