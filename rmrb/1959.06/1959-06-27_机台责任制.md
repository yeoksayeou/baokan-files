Machine Responsibility System
By our reporter Kang Weizhong and Wang Baoxin

Recently, the statistician of Harbin Bearing Factory reported encouraging news to the whole factory: by the end of May, the output of 270 machines in the factory had doubled (accounting for 23% of the total number of machines), and the output of other machines had increased by 10% to 50%; the qualified rate of these machines' products had also greatly improved compared with April, and the percentage of qualified products of many machines had increased by 50% compared with April, reaching the standards stipulated by the state.

The machines were still the same machines, and the workers were still the same workers. What was the reason for them to achieve such excellent results? With excitement, the reporters visited some leading cadres and workers of the factory, and they all said in unison: The machine responsibility system played a decisive role in the increase of machine output and the continuous improvement of quality.

In March, when the factory accepted a batch of urgent tasks assigned by the state, each workshop, section, and team formulated specific measures with full confidence to ensure the completion of the plan ahead of schedule. However, the workers of Li Cunxin's team in the third section of the tool workshop showed a lack of confidence in completing this task. The reason was that this team had failed to complete the production plan for three consecutive months. However, a sense of responsibility as masters of the working class drove them to find a way to turn things around. So, the team used their spare time to hold three consecutive "Zhuge Liang" meetings, where everyone looked for reasons, thought of solutions, put forward ideas, and solved problems. Old worker Yu Yongsheng said: "In the past, the team's production tasks were not completed well, mainly because the responsibility system was not clear, and everyone's enthusiasm was not consistent. Most workers were active, and a few were lazy, just like one or two bald heads mixed in among ten monks, making it difficult to distinguish the real from the fake, and making it difficult to chant the scriptures well. In order to clarify responsibilities, I think the best way is to implement the machine responsibility system, select a machine leader for each machine, who will be in charge of the entire machine's production work, and the entire machine will be responsible for the completion of the task."

Everyone felt that this opinion was very reasonable, and some workers added that competitions should be carried out with the machine as a unit. When Xu Wanli's team in this section heard that a machine responsibility system was going to be implemented and machine competitions were going to be carried out, they immediately sent them a challenge letter to compete with them. In the first week, the two sides had ups and downs and were evenly matched; but in the second week, the situation was completely different. Li Cunxin's team, which implemented the machine responsibility system, exceeded Xu Wanli's team by 30%. The news that Li Cunxin's team defeated Xu Wanli's team quickly spread throughout the workshop, and the machine responsibility system was quickly promoted throughout the workshop. The factory's Party committee summarized their experience and promoted it throughout the factory in April.

After the establishment of the machine responsibility system, each machine has a machine leader, with the machine leader as the core, uniting other members of the machine to do a good job in production. The machine leader not only ensures the completion of their own production tasks, but also motivates other workers to actively do a good job in production, becoming a strong assistant to the production team leader. In order to do a good job in machine production and strive for the collective honor of the machine, the unity and mutual assistance between workers has been strengthened. Now, before each machine worker gets off work, they must prepare the drawings, raw materials, tools, etc. needed for the next shift's production. When the next shift's workers take over, they must also clearly explain the machine's operating conditions, the use of tools and dies, the operation methods, and even what to do first, what to do later, and how to work to achieve higher output and better quality. The previous shift's workers will not leave the workshop until the handover workers have started the machine smoothly. This shortens the auxiliary time of the machine and greatly increases the output per unit area of the machine. At the same time, due to the implementation of mutual inspection of products by workers and spot checks by machine leaders on the machine, the quality of products has also been greatly improved. For example, Liu Dongsheng's machine in the trial manufacturing workshop, after research by all the machine personnel, adopted the method of focusing on the first piece inspection, which reduced the scrap rate by 20% in April, and in early May, it continued to decrease by 70%. At present, the percentage of qualified products has reached 99.98%. In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the various indicators of the entire machine, each machine tries every means to improve the technical level of the apprentices. Du Yinghui, an apprentice in the ball pressing section of the steel ball workshop, had not completed the production plan for the past few months. After the implementation of the machine responsibility system, the old workers taught him the technology by hand, and his technical level quickly improved. In April, he overfulfilled the monthly production plan by 27%. After the implementation of the machine responsibility system, a trend of thrift prevails among the workers, and production costs have been greatly reduced. In the past, in the ball pressing section of the steel ball workshop, when using knife plates, as soon as there was a little wear, they would immediately be thrown into the waste box. What about now? The workers try their best to repair and grind the damaged knife plates and reuse them. In the past, the machine used an average of 14 knife plates per day, but now it has been reduced to four to seven, and sometimes two are enough. There is even more savings in raw materials and materials. In the past, the ball pressing section of the steel ball workshop once calculated such an account: 3,100 kilograms of steel bars should be able to press 1.08 million steel balls, but in fact, only 800,000 steel balls were pressed. The reason was that the molds used to press the steel balls expanded after a period of time, but they continued to press the steel balls, resulting in a waste of steel. Now, with the material indicators assigned to the machine, the workers calculate carefully and frequently check the molds and specifications. In this way, not only is there no waste, but 286 kilograms of steel are saved, which can produce 238,000 more steel balls (15/64 mm in diameter).

The implementation of the machine responsibility system also embodies the principle of making economic work more and more detailed in enterprises. As the most basic production unit in an enterprise, the production team faces various problems in production, management, and the ideology and life of the masses every day. How to deal with these problems? Should we rely solely on the team leader to handle them? Or should we rely on the majority of employees to solve them themselves? The implementation of the machine responsibility system has found a good way to rely on the masses to solve problems themselves. Since each machine has a machine leader, who can organize everyone to solve problems as a whole; at the same time, there are not many people on each machine, and they have more contact with each other in production. Everyone is familiar with each other's production technology, enthusiasm for production, ideological problems, and life difficulties, so mutual assistance is also more timely and can be done in a targeted manner. In order to consolidate and develop the machine responsibility system, the bearing factory has also specifically stipulated the scope of authority of the machine responsibility system: to ensure the completion of the various tasks and indicators of the machine, the management of reprocessed products, and the maintenance of equipment; and to be responsible for checking the technical operation of the machine. These practices are conducive to giving play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the machine leader and conducive to doing a good job in production.

    机台责任制
    本报记者　康伟中　王宝馨
    最近，哈尔滨轴承厂的统计员向全厂报告了一项鼓舞人心的消息：到5月末，全厂有二百七十个机台的产量翻了一番（占总机台23％），其他机台也都增产10％到50％；这些机台的产品合格率比4月份又有了很大的提高，不少机台正品率比4月份提高了50％，达到了国家规定的标准。
    机台还是那些机台，工人还是那些工人，究竟是什么原因使他们获得如此优异的成绩的呢？记者怀着兴奋的心情，访问了这个厂的一些领导干部和工人，他们都异口同声地说：机台责任制对机台产量增加、质量不断提高起了决定性的作用。
    3月，当全厂接受了国家交给的一批紧急任务时，每个车间、工段和小组，都满怀信心地制定具体措施，保证提前完成计划。可是，工具车间第三工段李存信小组的工人们，对完成这项任务却表现信心不足。原因是这个小组已经连续三个月没有完成生产计划了。但是，一种工人阶级主人翁的责任感驱使他们一定要想个办法翻过身来。于是小组就利用业余时间连续开了三天“诸葛亮”会，大家找原因，想办法，出主意，解决问题。老工人于永生说：“过去小组生产任务完成得不好，主要是责任制度不明，大家干劲不一致，多数工人积极，少数人偷懒，就好像十个和尚当中夹了一、两个秃子一样，真假难分，经也不好念了。为了分清责任，我看最好的办法是实行机台责任制，每个机台选个机台长，统管整个机台生产工作，任务完成好坏，由全机台负责。”
    大家都觉得这个意见很有道理，有的工人还补充说要以机台为单位开展竞赛。这个工段的徐万礼小组听说要搞机台责任制和开展机台竞赛，立刻向他们递上挑战书，要和他们比高低。第一个星期，两方面互有上下，不分胜负；但是第二个星期情况就完全不同了，实行机台责任制的李存信小组超过了徐万礼小组30％。李存信小组战胜徐万礼小组的消息马上传遍了整个车间，很快机台责任制就在全车间推广了。这个厂的党委总结了他们的经验，4月份就在全厂推广开了。
    机台责任制建立以后，每个机台都有一个机台长，以机台长为核心，团结机台其他成员搞好生产。机台长不仅保证自己完成生产任务，同时还带动其他工人积极搞好生产，成为生产小组长的有力助手。为了把机台生产搞好，争取机台集体荣誉，工人之间的团结互助加强了。现在每个机台工人在下班以前都要把下一班生产需用的图纸、原材料、工具等准备好，当下一班工人接班时，还要把机器的运行情况、工具、胎具的使用情况、操作方法，甚至先干什么、后干什么，怎么工作产量更高、质量更好等等，都交代得清清楚楚；一直到接班工人把机器开动得很顺利了，上一班工人才离开车间。这就缩短了机器的辅助时间，大大提高了机台单位面积的产量；同时，由于在机台上执行了对产品的互相检查和机台长抽查的制度，产品质量也有了很大提高。如试造车间刘东升机台，经过全机台人员的研究，采取了抓首件检查的办法，使4月份废品率降低20％，5月上旬，又继续降低了70％，目前正品率已达到99.98％。为了保证完成和超额完成整个机台的各项指标，每个机台都想尽各种办法提高徒工的技术水平。钢球车间的压球工段有个徒工杜瑛辉，过去几个月都没有完成生产计划，实行机台责任制后，由于老工人把着手教他技术，技术水平很快提高了，4月份超额27％完成了全月生产计划。实行机台责任制以后，工人中节约之风盛行，生产成本大大降低了。过去在钢球车间的压球工段，使用刀板时，只要有一点磨损马上就扔到废物箱里。现在呢？工人尽力把损坏的刀板修一修，磨一磨，重新使用。机台过去每天平均要用刀板十四块，现在减少到四至七块，有时两块就够了。至于原材料和物料的节约就更多了。过去钢球车间压球工段曾经算过这样一笔账：用三千一百公斤的钢棍，应该压制出一百零八万个钢球，可是实际上却只压制八十万个，原因是压制钢球使用的胎模经过一段一段时间冲压后，模型撑大了，但是他们还继续压制钢球，结果就浪费了钢材。现在，材料指标下达机台，工人精打细算，经常检查胎具和规格，这样不仅没有浪费，还节约了钢材二百八十六公斤，可以多制造钢球二十三万八千个（直径15／64公厘的）。
    实行机台责任制也体现了在企业中经济工作愈作愈细的原则。作为企业最基层的生产小组，每天都面临着生产、管理，以及群众思想和生活上的各种问题。怎样对待这些问题呢？是仅仅依靠小组长处理呢？还是依靠大多数职工自己解决？实行机台责任制就找到了依靠群众自己解决问题的好方法。由于每个机台都有机台长，能够组织大家统盘解决问题；同时每个机台人数不多，在生产上互相接触比较多，谁的生产技术如何，生产劲头足不足，思想上有什么问题，生活上有什么困难，彼此都比较熟悉和了解，所以相互帮助也比较及时，并能够作到有的放矢。轴承厂为巩固和发展机台责任制，还具体规定了机台责任制的职权范围是：保证本机台各项任务和指标的完成、再制品的管理、设备的维护保养；负责检查本机台的技术操作。这些做法都有利于发挥机台长的主动性和积极性，有利于把生产搞好。
