Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 11th (By our correspondent Chen Quanbi): Since the end of last year, various types of People's Cultural Universities have been established in factories, collective farms, and government offices throughout the Soviet Union. To date, the number of these cultural universities has increased to over a thousand across the Soviet Union, with a student body of over 500,000. In Moscow Oblast alone, there are more than fifty People's Cultural Universities, and Moscow city has thirty.

The People's Cultural Universities established throughout the Soviet Union have been widely welcomed and supported by the working people. Alferyev, Director of the Cultural and Educational Institutions Administration of the Soviet Ministry of Culture, recently told reporters that People's Cultural Universities are an extremely important way to comprehensively educate the people in communism during the period of comprehensive communist construction. They are also a concrete manifestation of the masses' increasingly urgent demand to raise their cultural and technical levels and enrich their cultural lives as the economy soars. Because these schools are created by the masses themselves, their names are not uniform. Currently, there are various names such as "Communist University," "People's University," "Art University," and "Music University." The length of study also varies, from one year to two or three years. The work carried out by the People's Cultural Universities differs from that of factory and office clubs and cultural palaces. The latter only engage in daily recreational activities and organize temporary topical reports, while the People's Cultural Universities conduct systematic and formal lectures. They also differ from the night universities and correspondence universities attached to various universities, factories, enterprises, and government offices. Night universities and correspondence universities are a type of professional education and ideological and theoretical education of the Party, which cultivate professional cadres and conduct strict examinations of students according to the teaching schedule. Students receive certain certificates upon completion of their studies; however, People's Cultural Universities only aim to raise the cultural level and artistic appreciation ability of the working people, and do not conduct examinations or issue any graduation certificates.

Alferyev said that the People's Cultural Universities throughout the Soviet Union are led by the Party, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge. The daily teaching work is led by the management committee composed of the cultural university. The committee's task is to hire teachers and formulate and supervise the implementation of the teaching plan. The teaching method of the cultural university adopts lectures and demonstrations. The teachers are all well-known actors, artists, and writers from various places.

In order to further develop and consolidate the existing People's Cultural Universities and exchange the initial experiences gained in running schools in various places, the Soviet Ministry of Culture, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, and the Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge jointly convened a conference of principals of People's Cultural Universities from various places. At the meeting, the understanding of the nature and tasks of the People's Cultural Universities was unified and deepened, and many suggestions were made for further expanding the cultural university network.

The People's Cultural Universities in the Soviet Union were initially initiated by the Gomel Railway Workers' Club in the Ukrainian Republic. The first People's Cultural University in the Soviet Union, the "Gomel Socialist Cultural University," has now opened three departments: drama, music, and plastic arts, with a student body of more than 900. At present, People's Cultural Universities are continuing to be established in cities such as Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, Riga, Tallinn, Kharkov, Tomsk, and Stalingrad, as well as in the vast countryside. It is expected that after the start of the new academic year this year, the People's Cultural Universities will enter a period of large-scale development.

In a People's Cultural University in Moscow, students are discussing a play to be performed. Among them are students, workers, and residents.

    提高文化技术水平　提高艺术欣赏能力
    苏联办起一千多所人民文化大学
    新华社莫斯科11日电　本社记者陈泉璧报道：去年年底以来，在苏联一些工厂、集体农庄和机关中纷纷成立了各种类型的人民文化大学。到目前为止，这种文化大学在全苏联已经增加到一千多所，学生人数已达五十多万。单在莫斯科州就有五十多个人民文化大学，莫斯科市有三十个这种大学。
    苏联各地举办的人民文化大学受到了劳动人民的普遍欢迎和支持。苏联文化部文教事业管理局局长阿尔费耶夫不久前对记者说，人民文化大学是全面展开共产主义建设时期对人民进行全面共产主义教育的一种极重要的方式，也是随着经济的高涨群众更加迫切要求提高文化技术水平和丰富文化生活的具体表现。由于这种学校是由群众自己创造的，所以它的名称并不统一。现在，各地有“共产主义大学”、
  “人民大学”、“艺术大学”和“音乐大学”等各种名称。学习期限也不一致，一年、两年、三年不等。人民文化大学与工厂、机关的俱乐部，文化宫所进行的工作不同，后者只是进行日常的文娱活动和组织临时性的专题报告，而人民文化大学则要进行系统的和正规的讲授。它与附设在各大学、工厂企业、机关的夜大学和函授大学也不同。夜大学和函授大学是一种专业教育和党的思想理论教育，是培养专业的干部，按照教学的进度要对学生进行严格的考试，学习期满后发给一定的证件；而人民文化大学只是提高劳动人民的文化水平和对艺术的欣赏能力，而且不进行考试和不发给任何结业证件。
    阿尔费耶夫说，苏联各地的人民文化大学由党、工会、共青团和苏联政治和科学知识普及协会进行领导，日常的教学工作则由文化大学所组成的管理委员会来领导。委员会的任务是聘请教员、制订和监督教学计划的实行。文化大学的教学方式采取讲授和示范教学的方式进行。担任教学工作的都是各地著名的演员、艺术工作者、作家。
    为了进一步发展和巩固现有的人民文化大学，交流各地在办学方面初步获得的经验，不久以前苏联文化部、全苏工会中央理事会、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会、苏联政治和科学知识普及协会曾联合召开了各地人民文化大学的校长会议。会上，统一和加深了对人民文化大学的性质和任务的认识，并对进一步扩大文化大学网提出了许多建议。
    苏联的人民文化大学最初是由乌克兰共和国戈米尔铁路工人俱乐部发起创办的。苏联第一所人民文化大学——“戈米尔社会主义文化大学”现在已开设了戏剧、音乐和造型艺术三个系，学生人数已达九百多人。目前，人民文化大学还继续在莫斯科、基辅、列宁格勒、里加、塔林、哈尔科夫、托木斯克、斯大林格勒等城市和广大农村成立。预计在今年新学年开始后，人民文化大学将进入大规模发展的时期。
    在莫斯科的一所人民文化大学里，学员们正在讨论一个上演的剧本，他们当中有学生，也有工人和居民。
