    Must Ensure Safe Production
    Currently, workers on the production, capital construction, and transportation fronts are launching a high-spirited campaign to increase production and practice economy. At this time, it is essential for all enterprises to conduct a mass safety inspection and further strengthen various safety measures. This is an extremely important task to avoid and reduce casualties and ensure the smooth progress of the increase production and practice economy campaign.
    Safe production is an important principle of socialist enterprise management. Since the founding of New China, our Party and government have consistently cared for the safety and health of workers and attached great importance to safe production. The State Council has successively promulgated the "Factory Safety and Hygiene Regulations," the "Safety Technical Regulations for Building and Installation Projects," and the "Regulations on Reporting Work-Related Injury and Death Accidents of Workers and Staff"; all enterprises have generally formulated safety operation rules and regulations and a safety responsibility system; there are safety officers at production posts, etc. Due to the implementation of these regulations, many factories and mines across the country have achieved great results in safe production. However, recently some enterprises have neglected safe production, causing some unnecessary losses. This situation should be given serious attention and earnestly improved.
    The reasoning is very clear: unsafe production is extremely harmful to the health of workers and the normal production of enterprises. In our society, the most valuable wealth is people, the thousands upon thousands of workers who are engaged in selfless labor. Ensuring their safe production and protecting their health from accidents is the most important task in enterprise management. At the same time, in enterprises, especially in modern enterprises with continuous production, an accident in any link will cause losses to the entire enterprise. Some accidents not only affect the production of their own enterprises but also directly affect the production of other enterprises. For example, an accident at a power plant will force many production enterprises and construction projects to shut down. If 10,000 workers use the power from this power plant for production, then every hour of power outage will result in a loss of 10,000 labor hours of products for the state. Therefore, safe production must be regarded as an important condition for ensuring the Great Leap Forward in production. We must always pay attention to safety in production and never place safety in opposition to production, thinking that "if we care about production and the Great Leap Forward, we cannot care about safety." Nor can we regard safety work as an "additional" task outside of production: paying attention to it when there are many accidents or when production is not so busy, and ignoring it when there are fewer accidents or when production is more tense. On the contrary, the more we are in the Great Leap Forward, the more we need to pay attention to safe production; the more tense production is, the more we need to prevent accidents. Equipment that needs to be repaired must be repaired according to plan; safety measures must be strengthened where they are needed. The rules and regulations to guarantee safe production must be strictly observed. Of course, sometimes individual accidents are inevitable due to a lack of safety knowledge. However, "a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit," after an accident, we must seriously summarize the experiences and lessons learned, strengthen production safety measures, and strive to prevent or reduce accidents in the future.
    Now, the rainy season and hot season, which are prone to accidents, have arrived. In order to prevent problems before they occur, many factories and mines, capital construction units, and transportation enterprises, under the leadership of local Party committees, are carrying out a mass safety production inspection. In units where the movement was launched earlier and better, accidents have been significantly reduced, and the enthusiasm of the workers has been further enhanced. However, this movement has not yet been universally and deeply carried out in all enterprises; some are still only at the level of general calls, lacking specific requirements and detailed organizational work. We suggest that all enterprises seize the opportunity and be sure to do a good job in this safety production inspection. Each enterprise should put forward specific requirements for the inspection according to its own production and equipment characteristics. For example, coal mines should prevent roof falls, gas explosions, and water inrush accidents; capital construction projects should prevent worker shed fires, object strikes, etc. And the more to the grassroots, the more specific and practical the requirements of the inspection should be. Only in this way can we effectively prevent and eliminate accidents through inspection. During the inspection, we can adopt methods such as big airing of views, big contending, big debates, and posting big-character posters to fully mobilize the masses of workers, thoroughly expose all problems related to hindering safe production, deeply educate enterprise management cadres and workers, and mobilize the masses to use their brains and find ways to solve various problems exposed in the inspection together with the enterprise administrative departments. The experience of many past safety production inspections has proved that the vast majority of the problems found in the inspection can be solved by relying on the masses to find their own solutions. This kind of safety production inspection combining top-down and bottom-up is an important experience in implementing the policy of safe production and preventing casualties in our country since liberation, and should be continued and promoted.
    In order to ensure safe production, we must combine regular safety production inspections with regular labor protection work. Without regular labor protection work, the results achieved by the inspection movement cannot be consolidated, and the result will be like some workers criticizing, "Shout for a while at the meeting, no one asks about the specifics, and when an accident occurs, shout again." This is not permissible.
    In order to make safety work routine, first of all, it is necessary to establish and improve the rules and regulations necessary to ensure safe operation, and strictly follow the procedures in production. The reason for accidents in some enterprises is that there are no necessary rules and regulations, or because the original system is abandoned, and no new system has been established, or there is a system but it is not firmly implemented. Workers and management cadres should understand that the enterprise management system is indispensable to ensure the normal operation of the enterprise. Last year, it was entirely necessary and achieved results to promote the elimination of unreasonable rules and regulations in the Great Leap Forward; however, some enterprises have also eliminated some reasonable rules and regulations, or although they have not been eliminated, they are not actually implemented, which is wrong. Especially the system related to safe production, must be taken a very serious attitude. Those systems that are necessary to ensure safe production should be immediately restored and resolutely implemented; those that have shortcomings but have not been replaced by more reasonable systems should also continue to be implemented until there is a new system to replace them. As for those that are indeed unreasonable, unfavorable to production, and unfavorable to giving play to the enthusiasm of workers, they can be abolished with the approval of higher authorities after testing and proving that they can indeed be abolished, and replaced with new and reasonable systems.
    In order to ensure safe production, it is also necessary to especially educate new workers on safe production. Last year, many enterprises recruited a large number of new workers, most of whom
    come from the countryside, generally have no safety production knowledge, and are prone to accidents in production. We must conduct systematic education for them through new worker induction education, on-site guidance, short-term training, special trade training, safety activity days, and pre-shift and post-shift meetings. Many enterprises have already established a mass safety officer system. This is a good form of implementing worker participation in management and the mass line in safety work, and the experience in this regard should be summarized and promoted. However, the mass safety officer system must also be combined with the administrative safety functional agencies to give full play to its role. The safety work agencies of some enterprises and enterprise management departments have been abolished or weakened, and have not yet been restored. This is wrong. Of course, it is necessary to streamline safety work agencies that are too bloated and have more full-time personnel than actually needed, but they must not be abolished. Each enterprise should set up full-time safety workers according to the size of the enterprise and the nature of production and the principle of simplification, and small enterprises should also have part-time workers to manage safety work. It is not acceptable for no one to be specifically responsible for safety work. For leaders at all levels of enterprises, in addition to relying on safety work functional agencies and mass safety officers and giving them support, an important point is to establish a safety production responsibility system, so that responsibilities are assigned at different levels, to different areas, and someone is responsible for everything at all times. When planning, arranging, and inspecting production, we must also plan, arrange, and inspect safety work at the same time; when adopting new technologies, changing process processes, and putting new products into production, we must take corresponding safety measures. In this way, we can implement the policy of safe production in all aspects of daily production and truly unify safety and production. In particular, workshop directors, section chiefs, construction site directors and other grassroots leading comrades and direct commanders of production should regard safety management as their due responsibility. At the same time, the labor departments of various places should also strengthen the supervision and inspection of the safety production of factories and mines and actively help them do this work well.
    At present, the hot season has arrived, and it is necessary to quickly carry out heatstroke prevention and cooling work. Recently, some provinces and cities have decided to take back the heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment that was transferred to other uses in the national steelmaking movement last year and give it to the original enterprises as much as possible. This is necessary. Because many new enterprises have been added very quickly, and a large number of new workers have not yet been trained to work in high-temperature heat, and the supply of heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment (such as fans, motors, etc.) is still not sufficient this year; therefore, factories and mines should find ways as soon as possible, implement a "foreign-local combination" in technical equipment, try to use various substitutes as much as possible, and vigorously strengthen organizational work. Time is pressing, and we must start immediately and should not wait.
    Since the founding of the country, we have done a lot of work in safety production and accumulated a lot of experience. As long as we unify safety and production at all times, rely on the masses of workers to do a good job in safety production, and improve the institutions and systems for safety work, we will surely be able to make greater achievements, thereby more powerfully promoting the continued upsurge of the increase production and practice economy campaign.

    必须安全生产
    现在，生产、基本建设和交通运输战线上的职工群众，正以高涨的热情展开增产节约运动。在这个时候，各个企业认真进行一次群众性的安全生产大检查，进一步加强各种安全生产措施，是十分必要的。这是避免和减少伤亡事故，保证增产节约运动顺利进行的极为重要的工作。
    安全生产是社会主义企业管理的一条重要原则。新中国成立以来，我们党和政府一贯关怀职工的安全和健康，十分重视安全生产。国务院先后颁布了“工厂安全卫生规程”、“建筑安装工程安全技术规程”和“工人职员伤亡事故报告规程”；各个企业普遍制定了安全操作规章制度和安全责任制；生产岗位上设有安全员等。由于实行这些规定，全国许多厂矿企业在安全生产方面取得了巨大的成绩。但是近来也有一些企业对于安全生产有所忽视，造成了一些不应有的损失。这种情况应当引起严重注意并切实予以改进。
  道理是很明显的，生产不安全，对于职工的健康和企业的正常生产都是十分有害的。在我们的社会里，最宝贵的财富是人，是千千万万的进行着忘我劳动的职工。保证他们安全生产，使他们的健康不受事故的损害，是企业管理工作中头等重要的任务。同时，在企业里，尤其在连续生产的现代企业里，任何一个环节出了事故，都会给整个企业造成损失。有些事故，不仅影响自己企业的生产，还直接影响到其它企业的生产。例如一个电厂出了事故，就会使许多生产企业和建设工程被迫停工。如果有一万工人使用这个电厂的电力进行生产，那么每停电一个小时，国家就要损失一万个劳动小时的产品。因此，必须把安全生产看作是保证生产大跃进的一个重要条件。要在生产中经常注意安全，决不能把安全和生产对立起来，以为“顾生产，顾跃进，就顾不了安全”。也不能把安全工作当做生产以外的“附加”任务：事故多或者生产不那么繁忙的时候抓一下，事故少或者生产较为紧张的时候便不管了。恰恰相反，越是大跃进，越需要注意安全生产；生产越是紧张，就越需要注意防止事故。该检修的设备，一定按计划检修；该采取安全措施的地方，一定加强安全措施。保证安全生产的规章制度，一定要严格遵守。当然，有时候由于缺乏安全生产知识，出了个别事故也是难免的。但是，“吃一堑，长一智”，出了事故，一定要认真地总结经验教训，加强生产安全的措施，争取以后不出或是少出事故。
    现在，容易发生事故的雨季和暑季来到了。为了防患于未然，许多厂矿企业、基本建设单位和交通运输企业，在各地党委的领导下，正在开展一次群众性的安全生产大检查。运动开展得较早较好的单位，事故已显著减少，职工群众的生产热情更加高涨。但是，这个运动目前还没有在所有企业中普遍地深入地开展起来，有的还只是停留在一般号召上，缺乏具体的要求和细致的组织工作。我们建议各个企业抓紧时机，务必把这一次的安全生产大检查切实搞好。每个企业都应该根据自己生产和设备的特点，提出大检查的具体要求。如煤矿要防止片帮冒顶、瓦斯爆炸和透水事故；基本建设工程要防止工棚失火、物体打击，等等。而且越往基层，检查的要求应该越具体、越落实。只有这样，才能通过检查，有效地防止和消除事故。在检查的时候，可以采取大鸣、大放、大辩论、贴大字报等方式，把职工群众充分发动起来，全面地彻底地揭发一切有关妨碍安全生产的问题，使企业管理干部和职工群众受到深刻的教育，并且动员群众开动脑筋、想办法，同企业行政部门一道来解决检查中暴露出来的各种问题。过去多次安全生产大检查的经验证明，检查中发现的问题，绝大多数都可以依靠群众自己想办法解决。这种自上而下和自下而上相结合的安全生产大检查，是我国解放以来贯彻安全生产方针、防止伤亡事故的一条重要的经验，应该继续坚持和推广。
    为了保证安全生产，必须把定期的安全生产大检查和经常性的劳动保护工作结合起来。只有定期的检查，没有经常的劳动保护工作，就不能巩固检查运动所取得的成果，其结果也就像某些工人所批评的那样，“会上喊一阵，具体无人问，事故发生了，再来喊一阵”。这是不能容许的。
    为了做到安全工作经常化，首先必须建立和健全那些为保证安全操作所必需的规章制度，在生产中要严格按照规程办事。现在有的企业发生事故，就是因为没有必要的规章制度，或者因为原有的制度废弛，新制度又没有建立起来，或者有制度没有坚决执行。应当使职工群众和管理干部了解，企业管理制度是保证企业生产正常进行所必不可少的。去年大跃进中提倡破除不合理的规章制度，是完全必要的，也取得了成绩；但是，有些企业对一些合理的规章制度也破除了，或者虽然没有破除但实际上也不执行了，这是不对的。特别是有关安全生产的制度，必须采取十分严肃的态度。对于那些保证安全生产所必须的制度，应当立即恢复并坚决实行起来；对于那些虽然有缺点但还没有较合理的制度代替的，也应当继续执行，直至有新的制度来代替为止。至于那些确实不合理，不利于生产，不利于发挥职工的积极性的，经过试验，证明确实可以废除的，经上级机关批准，才能废除，并代以新的合理的制度。
    为了保证安全生产，还必须特别对新工人进行安全生产的教育。去年，许多企业都招收了大批新工人，他们大都
    来自农村，一般都没有安全生产知识，在生产中容易发生事故。我们要通过新工人入厂教育、现场指导、短期轮训、特殊工种训练、安全活动日、班前班后会议等形式，对他们进行系统的教育。现在不少企业中已经建立了群众性的安全员制度。这是在安全工作上贯彻执行工人参加管理和群众路线的一种很好的形式，这方面的经验应该总结和推广。但是，群众性的安全员制度还必须与行政上的安全职能机构结合起来，才能充分发挥它的作用。有的企业以及企业主管部门的安全工作机构被撤销了，或者削弱了，现在还没有恢复起来。这是不对的。当然，安全工作机构太臃肿，专职人员超过实际需要，是应当精简的，但是决不能取消。每个企业都应该根据企业的规模和生产的性质以及精简的原则来设置专职安全工作人员，小型企业也应当有兼职工作人员来管安全工作，无人具体负责安全工作是不行的。对于企业各级领导人员来说，除了必须依靠安全工作职能机构和群众性的安全员，并给他们以支持外，很重要的一条是必须建立安全生产责任制，做到分级负责，分片负责，事事有人负责，时时有人负责。在计划、布置、检查生产的时候，必须同时计划、布置、检查安全工作；在采用新技术、改变工艺过程、新产品投入生产的时候，必须采取相应的安全措施。这样，才能够把安全生产方针贯彻到日常生产的各个环节中去，把安全和生产真正统一起来。特别是车间主任、工段长、工地主任等基层领导同志和生产的直接指挥者，更应该把管安全看做是自己的应有的职责。同时，各地的劳动部门也应该加强对于厂矿企业安全生产的监督检查工作，积极地帮助他们把这件工作做好。
    目前，暑季已经到来，必须迅速进行防暑降温工作。最近有的省、市已经决定，把去年全民办钢铁运动中移作他用的防暑降温设备，尽可能地拿回给原来的企业使用。这是必要的。由于新企业增加得很多很快，大批新工人还没有受过在高温盛暑下劳动的锻炼，而且，今年防暑降温器材（例如风扇、马达等）的供应还不够充裕；因此，厂矿企业应该及早设法，在技术设备上实行“洋土结合”，尽量使用各种代用品，大力加强组织工作。时机紧迫，必须立即动手，不宜等待。
    建国以来，我们在安全生产方面已经做了很多工作，积累了许多的经验。只要我们时时刻刻把安全和生产统一起来，依靠职工群众搞好安全生产，健全安全工作的机构和制度，我们就一定能够做出更大的成绩，从而更加有力地促进增产节约运动的继续高涨。
