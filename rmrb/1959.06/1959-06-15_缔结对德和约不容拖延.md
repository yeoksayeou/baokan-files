Concluding a German Peace Treaty Cannot Be Delayed
Wei Liang

It has been fourteen years since the end of the war against Germany. The Allied countries that participated in the war against Germany have already signed peace treaties with other European countries that sided with Hitler's Germany, but a peace treaty with Germany has not been signed. This is obviously an extremely abnormal phenomenon. Now, concluding a German peace treaty has become an urgent and ripe international issue to be resolved.

    I

The Crimean Conference Communiqué of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in February 1945 stated that the purpose of the Allied occupation and control of Germany was to "eliminate German militarism and Nazism and ensure that Germany can never again disturb the peace of the world." The subsequent Potsdam Agreement further stipulated specifically that "German political life should be re-established on a democratic basis, and that Germany should participate in peaceful cooperation in international life in the future." The agreement also stipulated that the conference should be "responsible for preparing a peace treaty with Germany." It can be seen from the above provisions that the Allied countries at that time believed that the occupation of Germany was only a temporary measure, the purpose of which was to eliminate German militarism and Nazism and re-establish a peaceful and democratic Germany.

The Soviet Union has consistently advocated for the prompt preparation and conclusion of a German peace treaty in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. At the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference in July 1946, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in March 1947, the London Foreign Ministers Conference in December, and the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference in May 1949, the Soviet Union repeatedly proposed the establishment of a unified all-German government and the conclusion of a German peace treaty. However, these proposals were rejected by Western countries. While delaying the establishment of a German central administrative organ, Western countries used the fact that this central organ had not yet been established as an excuse to refuse to conclude a German peace treaty; on the other hand, they desperately implemented a policy of splitting Germany. In 1949, the unilateral establishment of the West German government headed by Adenauer created a situation of German division. The representatives of the German people also established the German Democratic Republic in East Germany. In this way, two Germanys appeared on the territory of the original Germany.

Since then, Western countries have made every effort to promote a policy of arming West Germany. They accelerated the revival of West German militarism and successively signed the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Agreement with West Germany, dragging West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. All this completely undermined the Potsdam Agreement and deepened the division of Germany.

However, despite this, the Soviet government still strived to conclude a German peace treaty as soon as possible and promote the reunification of Germany. Considering the reality of the existence of two Germanys and the situation where West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its accelerated atomic armament within the North Atlantic Group have created obstacles to the rapprochement of the two Germanys, the Soviet government, while proposing a draft German peace treaty, also proposed many constructive suggestions and measures that would help promote the rapprochement of the two Germanys and eliminate obstacles to the conclusion of a peace treaty. In recent years, the Soviet Union has announced the end of the state of war against Germany, the cancellation of military occupation of the German Democratic Republic, the restoration of normal diplomatic relations with West Germany. It has also suggested the withdrawal of foreign troops in East and West Germany and Europe, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and the signing of a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Group and the Warsaw Treaty member states. In 1957, the German Democratic Republic also proposed the establishment of a confederation between the two Germanys, which was supported by the Soviet government. All these suggestions and measures are conducive to signing a German peace treaty and creating good conditions for a peaceful resolution of the German question. However, Western countries have unreasonably refused them, insisting on using so-called "free elections" to annex the German Democratic Republic to establish an "all-German government," and then sign a peace treaty with this "all-German government." This is clearly to obstruct the conclusion of a German peace treaty.

Since the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in 1955, Western countries have been obstructing further negotiations and have been committed to the rearmament of West Germany. However, changes in the international situation and the strong development of the German Democratic Republic are increasingly unfavorable to the West. In January of this year, after suggesting that West Berlin become a demilitarized free city, the Soviet government once again proposed a draft German peace treaty and suggested holding negotiations. At the same time, the Soviet government stated that if Western countries reject the Soviet proposal, the Soviet government will sign a separate peace treaty with the government of the German Democratic Republic. Thanks to the initiative of the Soviet government and the efforts of the people of all countries, the Four Foreign Ministers finally held a meeting in Geneva with the participation of the two Germanys. This is another victory for the forces of peace.

    II

At the Geneva conference, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic worked together to strive for the conclusion of a German peace treaty. However, Western countries continued to obstruct and sabotage, proposing a "package plan," insisting on first "unifying Germany" and then concluding a peace treaty; wanting to use West Germany to annex the German Democratic Republic to "unify Germany," attempting to use this to delay the signing of a German peace treaty.

In order to deceive world public opinion, Western countries put forward some so-called "legal arguments" to defend their claim of refusing to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys.

The first reason presented by Herter in his speech at the Foreign Ministers' Conference on May 18 was: the "international entity called Germany" was once at war with the United States and has unresolved issues with the United States. Therefore, the United States believes that "any 'final arrangements' must wait until a government is established that can represent and bind the entire Germany."

Herter's "reason" is fundamentally untenable. As everyone knows, the United States itself has signed many military treaties with West Germany. Just on May 7th of this year, the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the United States also signed an agreement with West Germany on the use of nuclear weapons. This West German government is obviously not the "international entity" that Herter said "can represent and bind the entire Germany." If the United States believes that a peace treaty can only be concluded with a unified Germany, then why didn't it wait until Germany was unified before signing those military treaties? Since West Germany can be the object of the United States concluding military treaties, then why can't it be the object of signing a peace treaty? Herter himself knew that others might raise these questions to him, so in his speech he also tried to convince people that the United States' practice of signing the Bonn Treaty with West Germany "is not contradictory" to its current attitude towards concluding a peace treaty, on the grounds that the Bonn Treaty is only a "temporary arrangement." However, according to the provisions of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Agreement, the occupying forces of the United States, Britain, and France will remain in West Germany until 1998. This is the "temporary arrangement" that Herter is talking about! If the United States believes that it is necessary to make such a long-term "temporary arrangement" with West Germany, then what else can it explain other than that the United States does not intend to conclude a peace treaty with Germany before 1998?

Another "reason" Herter gave for not being able to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys is that since "the United States has never been at war with the Federal Republic of Germany or the so-called German Democratic Republic," any peace treaty concluded with the two Germanys cannot be a final peace treaty, because neither of the two Germanys, whether separate or together, can be called the all-German government. This "reason" is also very ridiculous. According to this statement, since the United States "has not been at war with the Federal Republic of Germany," there is no reason to occupy West Germany. That is to say, the United States should admit that the West German "Occupation Statute" formulated by the United States, Britain, and France in 1949 is completely illegal and is an act of armed aggression against the Federal Republic of Germany. As for the claim that a peace treaty cannot be concluded with the two Germanys, it is also completely untenable. There have been facts in history where a country was destroyed in a war, and then some new countries that emerged on its territory concluded a peace treaty. The Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I is an example. The Allied Powers signed the Treaty of Saint-Germain with Austria on September 10, 1919, and the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary on June 4, 1920, and the United States was also a signatory to these two treaties. Since the United States believes that Austria and Hungary together can represent the Austro-Hungarian Empire before World War I, then why can't the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany together represent Germany before World War II? Does the United States still want to pull Hitler out of the grave, ask him to restore pre-war Hitler's Germany, and have him conclude a peace treaty with the United States?

Herter's third reason for believing that a peace treaty cannot be concluded with the two Germanys is that doing so will "in effect recognize the long-term division of Germany." The West acts as if it is resolutely "opposed" to the division of Germany. However, it is the West itself that has caused the current state of division of Germany. As early as the Tehran Conference and the Crimean Conference, the United States had proposed dividing Germany into five countries. Britain also proposed dividing Germany into three parts at the Crimean Conference. It was only because of the Soviet Union's opposition that the conference decided to establish a unified Germany after the war. But later the West broke the wartime agreement, unilaterally decided to establish the West German state in the three occupation zones, and established the West German government headed by Adenauer. Although the West is currently shouting about "unifying Germany," in fact, they are not really interested in the unification of Germany, but want to use this as an excuse to delay the conclusion of a German peace treaty. American columnist Lippmann pointed out in the "New York Herald Tribune" that "in London and Paris, and even in Bonn," there is a "fear of a reunified Germany." He also said that Macmillan, Adenauer, and de Gaulle "all agree that the two Germanys will not be reunified."

Currently, there are indeed two Germanys, and the unification of Germany is far away. In this case, concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys has become the only realistic and feasible way. Therefore, Western countries have no reason to oppose the Soviet proposal. At the same time, the second part of the Soviet draft peace treaty is about the restoration of German unity. Article 22 clearly stipulates that the Allied countries recognize the right of the German people to restore German unity, and are prepared to provide all assistance to the two Germanys in order to achieve this goal on the basis of the rapprochement and consultation between the two Germanys. Article 24 also stipulates that the peace treaty will remain valid after Germany is restored to unity, and the terms of the peace treaty will apply to the unified Germany. Therefore, it is also completely unfounded for the West to insist that signing such a peace treaty is "recognizing the permanent division of Germany."

    III

At present, the conditions for concluding a German peace treaty are not only fully ripe, but also very necessary for promoting the unification of the two Germanys and consolidating peace in Europe.

When Western countries oppose the Soviet proposal to conclude a peace treaty, the loudest cry is that the Soviet Union's claim to sign a peace treaty with the two Germanys will contain "the seeds of discord and conflict" in the future. However, the US government's foreign policy is not formulated according to Herter's beautiful words. Can it be said that the United States, while delaying the signing of a German peace treaty and signing an agreement with West Germany on the use of nuclear weapons to accelerate the armament of West Germany with nuclear weapons, can reduce "the seeds of discord and conflict"? Everyone knows that the long-term failure to sign a German peace treaty is precisely the talisman for Western countries to support the forces of West German militarism. Therefore, in accordance with the Soviet proposal, signing a peace treaty with the two Germanys will not increase "the seeds of discord and conflict." On the contrary, because the treaty stipulates the elimination of the threat of German militarism and helps the two Germanys develop on a peaceful path, this will help the two Germanys approach each other, help reduce "the seeds of discord and conflict," create conditions for the reunification of Germany, and thus ease the European and international situation. Isn't this obvious?

Western countries cannot overthrow the Soviet draft peace treaty, so they slander the Soviet Union's current proposal as making Germany "discriminated against" and making Germany "unable to become an equal member of the international community." They also say that the Soviet draft peace treaty is "imposed" on Germany like the "Treaty of Versailles."

This is a clumsy trick to confuse black and white. Anyone who understands a little history knows that the Treaty of Versailles was a product of imperialist war. It was a robber treaty used by the Allied countries such as the United States, Britain, and France to enslave Germany, carve up German colonies, and spheres of influence. It was a treaty of this nature that had to be imposed on Germany. The Soviet government at that time opposed the Treaty of Versailles. Now, the German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union is fundamentally different in nature from the Treaty of Versailles. The preamble to the Soviet draft peace treaty clearly stipulates that the purpose of the treaty is "to hope to ensure that Germany has the possibility of peaceful and democratic development, and to carry out effective cooperation with other countries as an equal member of the big family of the people of all countries"; Article 26 of the draft stipulates that Germany can "have its own national armed forces necessary to ensure national defense"; Article 32 stipulates that "no restrictions shall be imposed on the peaceful economic development of Germany," and "no restrictions shall be imposed on Germany's trade, navigation, and participation in the world market with other countries." At this Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet Union also supplemented this article, stipulating that Germany "has the right to establish enterprises in the peaceful use of atomic energy." From here, people can see the Soviet Union's respect for the interests of the German people. However, the result of the Treaty of Versailles was the support of German fascism, which bred the root of World War II; while the draft proposed by the Soviet Union is to eradicate German militarism and help Germany become a peaceful and democratic country. At the same time, the Soviet Union's proposal is to convene a peace conference with the participation of the two Germanys to discuss this draft, and does not intend to impose this draft on Germany. Therefore, the Soviet draft is in line with the fundamental interests of the German people and has been widely supported by the German Democratic Republic and the West German public.

In short, Western countries' attempt to distort the Soviet draft peace treaty to cover up their long-term plan to split Germany and arm West Germany will not achieve its goal. Their conspiracy to delay the conclusion of a German peace treaty for a long time, so that they can legally turn West Germany into a source of new war, will also go bankrupt. The struggle to strive for the conclusion of a German peace treaty is a major struggle to stop the revival of West German militarism and safeguard peace in Europe and the world.

    缔结对德和约不容拖延
    苇良
    对德战争结束已经十四年了，参加对德战争的盟国已经同站在希特勒德国方面的其他欧洲国家都签订了和约，就是没有签订对德和约，这显然是极不正常的一种现象。现在，缔结对德和约已成为目前国际上急待解决而又成熟了的国际问题。	一
    1945年2月，苏、美、英三国克里米亚会议公报曾声明，盟国占领和管制德国的宗旨是
  “消灭德国的军国主义和纳粹主义，确保德国决不能再扰乱世界的和平”。以后的波茨坦协定又进一步作了具体规定，要“使德国政治生活在民主基础上获得重新建立，并使德国将来在国际生活上参与和平合作”。协定还规定，会议应该“负责准备对德和约”。从上述规定可以看出，当时盟国认为占领德国只是一种临时性的措施，其目的是为了消灭德国军国主义和纳粹主义，重新建立一个和平民主的德国。
    苏联一贯主张按照波茨坦协定的规定，尽速准备和缔结对德和约。在1946年7月的巴黎外长会议、1947年3月的莫斯科外长会议和12月的伦敦外长会议及1949年5月的巴黎外长会议上，苏联曾一再提出建立统一的全德政府并缔结对德和约的建议。但这些建议都遭到西方国家的拒绝。西方国家一面拖延建立一个德国中央行政机关、同时又以这个中央机关尚未成立为借口拒绝缔结对德和约；另一方面却又拚命执行分裂德国的政策。1949年片面地建立了以阿登纳为首的西德政府造成了德国分裂的形势。德国人民的代表也在东德成立了德意志民主共和国。这样，在原来德国的领土上就出现了两个德国。
    从此以后，西方国家就竭力推行武装西德的政策。它们一面加紧复活西德军国主义，一面先后同西德签订了波恩条约和巴黎协定，把西德拉进了北大西洋侵略集团。这一切彻底破坏了波茨坦协定，使德国的分裂更加加深了。
    但是尽管如此，苏联政府仍然力求尽早缔结对德和约，促进德国重新统一。由于考虑到存在两个德国的现实情况，以及西德参加北大西洋公约组织并在北大西洋集团内加紧原子武装而造成了阻碍两个德国接近的形势，苏联政府在提出对德和约草案的同时，又提出许多有助于促进两个德国接近、消除缔结和约障碍的各种建设性建议和措施。近年来苏联宣布了结束对德战争状态，取消对德意志民主共和国的军事占领，恢复和西德的正常外交关系，并建议撤退在东西德和欧洲的外国军队、建立中欧无原子武器区、北大西洋集团和华沙条约缔约国签订互不侵犯条约等等。1957年德意志民主共和国也提出了两个德国建立邦联的建议，这个建议得到了苏联政府的支持。所有这一切建议和措施都有助于签订对德和约和为和平解决德国问题创造良好条件。但是，西方国家一味加以无理拒绝，坚持以吞并德意志民主共和国的所谓“自由选举”来建立一个“全德政府”，然后和这个“全德政府”签订一项和约。这显然是为了阻碍对德和约的缔结。
    自1955年四国外长会议以来，西方国家一直阻挠继续谈判，而致力于西德的重新武装。但是，国际形势的变化和德意志民主共和国的强大发展，日益不利于西方。今年1月苏联政府在建议使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市之后，再一次提出了对德和约草案，并建议举行谈判。同时，苏联政府声明，如果西方国家拒绝苏联的建议，苏联政府将同德意志民主共和国政府单独签订和约。由于苏联政府的倡议和各国人民的努力，四国外长终于在两个德国参加下在日内瓦举行会议。这是和平力量取得的又一个胜利。	二
    在日内瓦会议上，苏联和德意志民主共和国一起力求争取缔结对德和约。但西方国家继续进行阻挠和破坏，提出“一揽子计划”，坚持要先“统一德国”，再缔结和约；要用西德吞并德意志民主共和国的办法来“统一德国”，企图借此拖延对德和约的签订。
    为了欺骗世界舆论，西方国家提出了一些所谓“法律论点”，为他们拒绝同两个德国缔结和约的主张进行辩护。
    赫脱在5月18日外长会议上的发言中所提出的第一个理由是：曾经同美国处于战争状态并且同美国有悬而未决的问题的是“被称为德国的国际实体”，因此，美国认为“必须等到建立能够代表并约束整个德国的政府以后才能作出任何‘最后安排’”。
    赫脱的这个“理由”是根本不能自圆其说的。大家知道，美国自己曾同西德签订了不少军事条约。就在今年5月7日，也就是日内瓦外长会议开会的前夕，美国还同西德签订了关于使用核武器的协定。这个西德政府显然也不是赫脱所说的“能代表并约束整个德国”的
  “国际实体”。如果美国认为和约只能同统一的德国缔结的话，那末它为什么不等到德国统一以后再来签订那些军事条约呢？既然西德可以成为美国缔结军事条约的对象，那又为什么不能作为签订和约的对象呢？赫脱自己也知道别人可能会向他提出这些问题，因此他在发言中还企图使人相信，美国同西德签订波恩条约的做法同它现在对缔结和约的态度“并不矛盾”，理由是波恩条约只是一种“临时性安排”。可是，根据波恩条约和巴黎协定的规定，美英法三国在西德的占领军将一直留到1998年。这就是赫脱所说的“临时性安排”！如果美国认为有必要同西德作一个这样长期的“临时性安排”，那除了说明美国并不打算在1998年以前同德国缔结和约以外，还能说明什么呢？
    赫脱说不能同两个德国缔结和约的另一个“理由”是，由于“美国从来没有同德意志联邦共和国或所谓德意志民主共和国处于战争状态”，同两个德国缔结的任何和约不能成为最后的和约，因为两个德国不论是分开还是合在一起都不能被称为全德政府。这个“理由”也是非常可笑的。按照这种说法，美国既然“没有同德意志联邦共和国处于战争状态”，就没有理由占领西德。这就是说，美国应该承认，美英法三国在1949年所制订的西德“占领法规”完全是非法的，是对德意志联邦共和国的一种武装侵略行为。至于不能同两个德国缔结和约的说法，也是完全站不住脚的。在历史上曾经有过这样的事实，一个国家在战争中消灭了，这时就由在它领土上出现的一些新国家来缔结和约。第一次大战中奥匈帝国就是一个例子。协约国曾在1919年9月10日和1920年6月4日先后同奥地利和匈牙利签订了圣日耳曼和约和特里阿农和约，美国也是这两个和约的签字国。美国既然认为奥地利和匈牙利合在一起可以代表第一次大战前的奥匈帝国，那末，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国合在一起为什么就不能代表第二次大战前的德国呢？难道美国还想把希特勒从坟墓里拉出来，要他恢复战前的希特勒德国，并由他来同美国缔结和约吗？
    赫脱认为不能同两个德国缔结和约的第三个理由是：这样做将在“实际上承认德国的长期分裂”。西方俨然像是坚决“反对”分裂德国似的。可是，造成德国目前分裂状态的不是别人，正是西方自己。早在德黑兰会议和克里米亚会议上，美国就曾提出建议，主张把德国分为五个国家。英国也曾在克里米亚会议上提出把德国分为三部分的建议。只是由于苏联的反对，会议才决定在战后要建立一个统一的德国。但以后西方又破坏了战时的协议，片面决定在三国占领区成立西德国家，并建立了以阿登纳为首的西德政府。目前尽管西方口口声声叫喊要“统一德国”，但实际上它们并不是真正对德国的统一感到兴趣，不过是想用这来作为拖延缔结对德和约的一个借口。美国专栏作家李普曼就曾在“纽约先驱论坛报”上指出，“在伦敦和巴黎，甚至在波恩”，都存在着“害怕一个重新统一的德国的心理”。他还说，麦克米伦、阿登纳和戴高乐“都一致认识到，两个德国将不会重新统一。”
    目前事实上存在着两个德国，而德国的统一又遥遥无期，在这种情况下，同两个德国缔结和约就成为唯一现实可行的办法。因此，西方国家没有任何理由可以反对苏联的这个建议。同时，苏联的和约草案第二部分是有关恢复德国统一的条款，其中第二十二条明确规定，盟国承认德国人民恢复德国统一的权利，并准备给予两个德国一切协助，以便在两个德国接近和协商的基础上来达到这个目的。第二十四条还规定，和约在德国恢复统一后仍然有效，和约的条款将适用于统一的德国。因此，西方硬说签订这样的和约是“承认德国的永久分裂”，也是完全没有根据的。	三
    目前缔结对德和约，不仅条件已经完全成熟，而且对促进两个德国的统一和巩固欧洲的和平，也是非常必要的。
    西方国家在反对苏联的缔结和约的建议时，叫得最凶的是所谓苏联主张同两个德国签订和约将包含着将来发生“不和和冲突的种子”。但是，美国政府的对外政策，却并不是按照赫脱的这个漂亮言词制订的。难道说，像美国那样一方面拖延对德和约的签订，另一方面又同西德签订使用核武器的协定，加紧用核武器来武装西德，能减少“不和和冲突的种子”吗？谁都知道，对德和约长期没有签订正是西方国家扶植西德军国主义势力的护身符。因此，按照苏联的建议，同两个德国签订和约，决不会增加“不和和冲突的种子”，恰巧相反，由于和约规定取消德国军国主义的威胁，帮助两个德国向和平道路上发展，这将有助于两个德国的接近，有助于减少“不和和冲突的种子”，为德国重新统一创造了条件，从而使欧洲和国际局势趋向缓和。这不是很明显吗？
    西方国家无法推翻苏联的和约草案，于是它们污蔑苏联目前的建议是使德国“受到歧视”，使德国“不能成为国际大家庭中平等的一员”。还说什么苏联的和约草案是“像凡尔赛和约”那样“强加”于德国的。
    这是混淆黑白的拙劣手法。懂得一点历史的人都知道，凡尔赛和约是帝国主义战争的产物，是美英法等协约国用来奴役德国、瓜分德国殖民地和势力范围的强盗和约，正是这样性质的和约才要强加于德国。而苏联政府当时是反对凡尔赛和约的。现在，苏联提出的对德和约在根本性质上是不同于凡尔赛和约的。苏联的和约草案序言中明确规定，和约的目的是“希望保证德国有可能和平地和民主地发展，并以各国人民大家庭的一个平等成员身份同其他国家进行有成效的合作”；草案第二十六条规定德国可以“拥有自己为保障国防所必需的国家武装力量”；第三十二条规定“对德国和平经济的发展不加以任何限制”，“在德国同其他国家的贸易、航海、参加世界市场方面亦不加以任何限制”，在这次外长会议上，苏联还将这一条加以补充，规定德国“有权利在和平利用原子能方面兴办企业。”从这里人们可以看出苏联对德国人民利益的尊重。然而，凡尔赛和约的结果，扶植了德国法西斯主义，孕育了第二次世界大战的祸根；而苏联提出的草案则是要根除德国军国主义，帮助德国变成一个和平民主的国家。同时，苏联的主张是召开有两个德国参加的和会来讨论这一草案，并不打算把这个草案强加于德国。因此，苏联的草案是符合德国人民的根本利益的，得到了德意志民主共和国和西德公众广泛的支持的。
    总之，西方国家想对苏联的和约草案进行歪曲，来掩盖它们长期分裂德国、武装西德的计划，是达不到目的的。它们想长期拖延缔结对德和约，使它们可以合法地把西德变为新战争策源地，这个阴谋也是要破产的。争取缔结对德和约的斗争，是制止西德军国主义复活、维护欧洲和世界和平的重大斗争。
