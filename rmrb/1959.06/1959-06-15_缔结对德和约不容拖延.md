Concluding a German Peace Treaty Cannot Be Delayed
Wei Liang

It has been fourteen years since the end of the war against Germany. The Allied countries that participated in the war against Germany have already signed peace treaties with other European countries that sided with Hitler's Germany, but a peace treaty with Germany has not been signed. This is obviously an extremely abnormal phenomenon. Now, concluding a German peace treaty has become an urgent and ripe international issue to be resolved.

    I

The Crimean Conference Communiqu√© of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in February 1945 stated that the purpose of the Allied occupation and control of Germany was to "eliminate German militarism and Nazism and ensure that Germany can never again disturb the peace of the world." The subsequent Potsdam Agreement further stipulated specifically that "German political life should be re-established on a democratic basis, and that Germany should participate in peaceful cooperation in international life in the future." The agreement also stipulated that the conference should be "responsible for preparing a peace treaty with Germany." It can be seen from the above provisions that the Allied countries at that time believed that the occupation of Germany was only a temporary measure, the purpose of which was to eliminate German militarism and Nazism and re-establish a peaceful and democratic Germany.

The Soviet Union has consistently advocated for the prompt preparation and conclusion of a German peace treaty in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. At the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference in July 1946, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in March 1947, the London Foreign Ministers Conference in December, and the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference in May 1949, the Soviet Union repeatedly proposed the establishment of a unified all-German government and the conclusion of a German peace treaty. However, these proposals were rejected by Western countries. While delaying the establishment of a German central administrative organ, Western countries used the fact that this central organ had not yet been established as an excuse to refuse to conclude a German peace treaty; on the other hand, they desperately implemented a policy of splitting Germany. In 1949, the unilateral establishment of the West German government headed by Adenauer created a situation of German division. The representatives of the German people also established the German Democratic Republic in East Germany. In this way, two Germanys appeared on the territory of the original Germany.

Since then, Western countries have made every effort to promote a policy of arming West Germany. They accelerated the revival of West German militarism and successively signed the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Agreement with West Germany, dragging West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. All this completely undermined the Potsdam Agreement and deepened the division of Germany.

However, despite this, the Soviet government still strived to conclude a German peace treaty as soon as possible and promote the reunification of Germany. Considering the reality of the existence of two Germanys and the situation where West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its accelerated atomic armament within the North Atlantic Group have created obstacles to the rapprochement of the two Germanys, the Soviet government, while proposing a draft German peace treaty, also proposed many constructive suggestions and measures that would help promote the rapprochement of the two Germanys and eliminate obstacles to the conclusion of a peace treaty. In recent years, the Soviet Union has announced the end of the state of war against Germany, the cancellation of military occupation of the German Democratic Republic, the restoration of normal diplomatic relations with West Germany. It has also suggested the withdrawal of foreign troops in East and West Germany and Europe, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and the signing of a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Group and the Warsaw Treaty member states. In 1957, the German Democratic Republic also proposed the establishment of a confederation between the two Germanys, which was supported by the Soviet government. All these suggestions and measures are conducive to signing a German peace treaty and creating good conditions for a peaceful resolution of the German question. However, Western countries have unreasonably refused them, insisting on using so-called "free elections" to annex the German Democratic Republic to establish an "all-German government," and then sign a peace treaty with this "all-German government." This is clearly to obstruct the conclusion of a German peace treaty.

Since the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in 1955, Western countries have been obstructing further negotiations and have been committed to the rearmament of West Germany. However, changes in the international situation and the strong development of the German Democratic Republic are increasingly unfavorable to the West. In January of this year, after suggesting that West Berlin become a demilitarized free city, the Soviet government once again proposed a draft German peace treaty and suggested holding negotiations. At the same time, the Soviet government stated that if Western countries reject the Soviet proposal, the Soviet government will sign a separate peace treaty with the government of the German Democratic Republic. Thanks to the initiative of the Soviet government and the efforts of the people of all countries, the Four Foreign Ministers finally held a meeting in Geneva with the participation of the two Germanys. This is another victory for the forces of peace.

    II

At the Geneva conference, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic worked together to strive for the conclusion of a German peace treaty. However, Western countries continued to obstruct and sabotage, proposing a "package plan," insisting on first "unifying Germany" and then concluding a peace treaty; wanting to use West Germany to annex the German Democratic Republic to "unify Germany," attempting to use this to delay the signing of a German peace treaty.

In order to deceive world public opinion, Western countries put forward some so-called "legal arguments" to defend their claim of refusing to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys.

The first reason presented by Herter in his speech at the Foreign Ministers' Conference on May 18 was: the "international entity called Germany" was once at war with the United States and has unresolved issues with the United States. Therefore, the United States believes that "any 'final arrangements' must wait until a government is established that can represent and bind the entire Germany."

Herter's "reason" is fundamentally untenable. As everyone knows, the United States itself has signed many military treaties with West Germany. Just on May 7th of this year, the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the United States also signed an agreement with West Germany on the use of nuclear weapons. This West German government is obviously not the "international entity" that Herter said "can represent and bind the entire Germany." If the United States believes that a peace treaty can only be concluded with a unified Germany, then why didn't it wait until Germany was unified before signing those military treaties? Since West Germany can be the object of the United States concluding military treaties, then why can't it be the object of signing a peace treaty? Herter himself knew that others might raise these questions to him, so in his speech he also tried to convince people that the United States' practice of signing the Bonn Treaty with West Germany "is not contradictory" to its current attitude towards concluding a peace treaty, on the grounds that the Bonn Treaty is only a "temporary arrangement." However, according to the provisions of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Agreement, the occupying forces of the United States, Britain, and France will remain in West Germany until 1998. This is the "temporary arrangement" that Herter is talking about! If the United States believes that it is necessary to make such a long-term "temporary arrangement" with West Germany, then what else can it explain other than that the United States does not intend to conclude a peace treaty with Germany before 1998?

Another "reason" Herter gave for not being able to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys is that since "the United States has never been at war with the Federal Republic of Germany or the so-called German Democratic Republic," any peace treaty concluded with the two Germanys cannot be a final peace treaty, because neither of the two Germanys, whether separate or together, can be called the all-German government. This "reason" is also very ridiculous. According to this statement, since the United States "has not been at war with the Federal Republic of Germany," there is no reason to occupy West Germany. That is to say, the United States should admit that the West German "Occupation Statute" formulated by the United States, Britain, and France in 1949 is completely illegal and is an act of armed aggression against the Federal Republic of Germany. As for the claim that a peace treaty cannot be concluded with the two Germanys, it is also completely untenable. There have been facts in history where a country was destroyed in a war, and then some new countries that emerged on its territory concluded a peace treaty. The Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I is an example. The Allied Powers signed the Treaty of Saint-Germain with Austria on September 10, 1919, and the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary on June 4, 1920, and the United States was also a signatory to these two treaties. Since the United States believes that Austria and Hungary together can represent the Austro-Hungarian Empire before World War I, then why can't the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany together represent Germany before World War II? Does the United States still want to pull Hitler out of the grave, ask him to restore pre-war Hitler's Germany, and have him conclude a peace treaty with the United States?

Herter's third reason for believing that a peace treaty cannot be concluded with the two Germanys is that doing so will "in effect recognize the long-term division of Germany." The West acts as if it is resolutely "opposed" to the division of Germany. However, it is the West itself that has caused the current state of division of Germany. As early as the Tehran Conference and the Crimean Conference, the United States had proposed dividing Germany into five countries. Britain also proposed dividing Germany into three parts at the Crimean Conference. It was only because of the Soviet Union's opposition that the conference decided to establish a unified Germany after the war. But later the West broke the wartime agreement, unilaterally decided to establish the West German state in the three occupation zones, and established the West German government headed by Adenauer. Although the West is currently shouting about "unifying Germany," in fact, they are not really interested in the unification of Germany, but want to use this as an excuse to delay the conclusion of a German peace treaty. American columnist Lippmann pointed out in the "New York Herald Tribune" that "in London and Paris, and even in Bonn," there is a "fear of a reunified Germany." He also said that Macmillan, Adenauer, and de Gaulle "all agree that the two Germanys will not be reunified."

Currently, there are indeed two Germanys, and the unification of Germany is far away. In this case, concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys has become the only realistic and feasible way. Therefore, Western countries have no reason to oppose the Soviet proposal. At the same time, the second part of the Soviet draft peace treaty is about the restoration of German unity. Article 22 clearly stipulates that the Allied countries recognize the right of the German people to restore German unity, and are prepared to provide all assistance to the two Germanys in order to achieve this goal on the basis of the rapprochement and consultation between the two Germanys. Article 24 also stipulates that the peace treaty will remain valid after Germany is restored to unity, and the terms of the peace treaty will apply to the unified Germany. Therefore, it is also completely unfounded for the West to insist that signing such a peace treaty is "recognizing the permanent division of Germany."

    III

At present, the conditions for concluding a German peace treaty are not only fully ripe, but also very necessary for promoting the unification of the two Germanys and consolidating peace in Europe.

When Western countries oppose the Soviet proposal to conclude a peace treaty, the loudest cry is that the Soviet Union's claim to sign a peace treaty with the two Germanys will contain "the seeds of discord and conflict" in the future. However, the US government's foreign policy is not formulated according to Herter's beautiful words. Can it be said that the United States, while delaying the signing of a German peace treaty and signing an agreement with West Germany on the use of nuclear weapons to accelerate the armament of West Germany with nuclear weapons, can reduce "the seeds of discord and conflict"? Everyone knows that the long-term failure to sign a German peace treaty is precisely the talisman for Western countries to support the forces of West German militarism. Therefore, in accordance with the Soviet proposal, signing a peace treaty with the two Germanys will not increase "the seeds of discord and conflict." On the contrary, because the treaty stipulates the elimination of the threat of German militarism and helps the two Germanys develop on a peaceful path, this will help the two Germanys approach each other, help reduce "the seeds of discord and conflict," create conditions for the reunification of Germany, and thus ease the European and international situation. Isn't this obvious?

Western countries cannot overthrow the Soviet draft peace treaty, so they slander the Soviet Union's current proposal as making Germany "discriminated against" and making Germany "unable to become an equal member of the international community." They also say that the Soviet draft peace treaty is "imposed" on Germany like the "Treaty of Versailles."

This is a clumsy trick to confuse black and white. Anyone who understands a little history knows that the Treaty of Versailles was a product of imperialist war. It was a robber treaty used by the Allied countries such as the United States, Britain, and France to enslave Germany, carve up German colonies, and spheres of influence. It was a treaty of this nature that had to be imposed on Germany. The Soviet government at that time opposed the Treaty of Versailles. Now, the German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union is fundamentally different in nature from the Treaty of Versailles. The preamble to the Soviet draft peace treaty clearly stipulates that the purpose of the treaty is "to hope to ensure that Germany has the possibility of peaceful and democratic development, and to carry out effective cooperation with other countries as an equal member of the big family of the people of all countries"; Article 26 of the draft stipulates that Germany can "have its own national armed forces necessary to ensure national defense"; Article 32 stipulates that "no restrictions shall be imposed on the peaceful economic development of Germany," and "no restrictions shall be imposed on Germany's trade, navigation, and participation in the world market with other countries." At this Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet Union also supplemented this article, stipulating that Germany "has the right to establish enterprises in the peaceful use of atomic energy." From here, people can see the Soviet Union's respect for the interests of the German people. However, the result of the Treaty of Versailles was the support of German fascism, which bred the root of World War II; while the draft proposed by the Soviet Union is to eradicate German militarism and help Germany become a peaceful and democratic country. At the same time, the Soviet Union's proposal is to convene a peace conference with the participation of the two Germanys to discuss this draft, and does not intend to impose this draft on Germany. Therefore, the Soviet draft is in line with the fundamental interests of the German people and has been widely supported by the German Democratic Republic and the West German public.

In short, Western countries' attempt to distort the Soviet draft peace treaty to cover up their long-term plan to split Germany and arm West Germany will not achieve its goal. Their conspiracy to delay the conclusion of a German peace treaty for a long time, so that they can legally turn West Germany into a source of new war, will also go bankrupt. The struggle to strive for the conclusion of a German peace treaty is a major struggle to stop the revival of West German militarism and safeguard peace in Europe and the world.
