    Bryansk No. 2 Station is a huge hub on the Moscow-Kiev line. Several thousand young workers are employed at this station. These people are very studious and eager to learn. However, many of them have not received sufficient education and cannot fully understand scientific, aesthetic, and literary issues. They deeply feel this and therefore hope to receive more education.
    At an evening party organized by the railway workers' cultural center at Bryansk No. 2 Station for young people, before the games and dances began, a report was given on the cultural cultivation of young Soviet people.
    "What other reports would you like to hear?" Club director Shemyakin asked after the report: "Please give us more suggestions."
    "Hold more popular science lectures for us about new scientific discoveries," many young workers said excitedly, "Help us learn to analyze music and art, and tell us about the creative history of human culture."
    "According to you, we need to start a university!" Shemyakin said in a humorous tone of surprise.
    "Why can't we start one?" everyone asked in return.
    "Why can't our club organize report meetings on various topics and hold concerts, plays, and film screenings in conjunction with these reports?"
    The idea of establishing a cultural university was born. Young workers supported this idea, and the Party organizations also strongly supported it.
    The students of the Communist Cultural University are primarily young workers and students. However, as the largest club in the Bryansk area, the railway workers' cultural center could not refuse admission to other residents of this working-class town. Therefore, the Cultural University decided that everyone could enroll and that no fees would be charged to anyone.
    The duration of study at the university was set at two years. Classes are held twice a month. The syllabus is divided into nine parts, the main ones being Marxism-Leninism, aesthetics, music, drama, painting, literature, and science and technology news.
    The first lecture was held in mid-March this year. Its success exceeded people's expectations. The club's hall was filled with "university students." Giving reports to so many listeners were Fedorov, a candidate doctor of science and technology, and artist Liebermann. The former spoke about the present and future of chemistry, and the latter spoke about the development of dramatic art.
    These two reports aroused deep interest. Many listeners took notes like real university students. After the reports, actors from the Bryansk State Theater performed excerpts from certain plays by Soviet playwrights. These plays were concrete and vivid examples of Liebermann's report.
    Now, there have never been as many people coming to the club to see plays and attend concerts as there are listeners to the Cultural University. The hall is becoming more and more crowded.
    "There are not enough armchairs," the club director said, "It looks like we have to open branches."

    一个文化大学的诞生
    布良斯克二号车站是莫斯科—基辅线上一座巨大的枢纽站。在这个车站工作的有好几千青年工人。这些人非常好学，求知欲很强。但是其中很多人都没有受过足够的教育，对科学、美学和文学问题不能很好地了解。他们深深地感到这点，所以都希望自己得到更多的教育。
    在布良斯克二号车站铁路员工文化馆为青年们组织的一次晚会上，开始游戏和跳舞以前，有人作了关于青年苏维埃人文化修养问题的报告。
    “你们还想听些什么报告呢？”报告结束后，俱乐部主任谢米金问道：“请大家多提意见。”
    “多为我们举办些科学新发现的通俗讲座吧，”许多青年工人激动地说：“帮我们学会分析音乐和美术，给我们讲人类文化的创造史吧。”
    “照你们这么说，需要开办一所大学罗！”谢米金以诙谐的口吻惊奇地说。
    “为什么不能开办呢？”大家这样反问。
    “为什么我们俱乐部不组织各种题目的报告会，并配合这些报告会举行音乐会、话剧和电影演出呢？”
    建立文化大学的想法产生了。青年工人们支持这个想法，党团组织也都大力支持。
    共产主义文化大学的学生对象首先是青年工人和在学青年。但是，作为布良斯克这一带最大的俱乐部——铁路员工文化馆也不能拒绝这个工人小镇的其他居民入学。因此，文化大学决定，所有的人都可以入学，并且对任何人都不收费用。
    大学的学习期限订为两年。每月上课两次。教学大纲分为九个部分，其中主要的是马列主义、美学、音乐、戏剧、绘画、文学和科技新闻。
    第一次讲座是在今年3月中旬举办的。它的成功出乎人们的意料之外。俱乐部的大厅坐满了“大学生”。为这么多听众做报告的是科学技术后补博士费多罗夫和艺术家李别尔曼，前者讲了化学的今天和明天，后者讲了戏剧艺术的发展。
    这两个报告引起了人们深厚的兴趣。很多听众和真正的大学生一样记了笔记。报告后，布良斯克州剧院的演员演出了苏联话剧家某些剧的片断。这些剧是李别尔曼报告的具体而生动的例证。
    现在，来到俱乐部看戏和参加音乐会的人，没有一次有像文化大学听众这么多。大厅越来越显得拥挤了。
    “靠椅已经不够用了，”俱乐部主任说：“看样子得开设分院了。”
