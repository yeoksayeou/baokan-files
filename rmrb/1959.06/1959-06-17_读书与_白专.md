    Reading and "White Expertise"
    Cheng Yusi
    The trend of reading is becoming increasingly popular, a new phenomenon in 1959. Some people worry: will emphasizing reading, like before the rectification and anti-rightist movement, cause many people to bury themselves in books, ignore politics, and embark on the "white expertise" road?
    It is very necessary to be vigilant; excessive worries are unnecessary. This matter can be analyzed specifically.
    Before the rectification and anti-rightist movement, some people took advantage of the Party's call for intellectuals to march towards science to pursue their personal selfish goals; they advocated "one room, two books," ignoring politics, and indulging in the fog of fame and fortune, and as a result, embarked on the bourgeois road, and some even degenerated into bourgeois right-wing elements. This lesson is very profound and should not be forgotten by anyone.
    The problem is that the reason those people embarked on the bourgeois "white expertise" road, and even degenerated into right-wing elements, was not due to the result of reading, but because of their decadent bourgeois worldview, their rejection of the Party's leadership, and their aversion to politics.
    Will the phenomenon that occurred before the rectification and anti-rightist movement be repeated in 1959? No one can guarantee that the above-mentioned people will absolutely not appear again in the future; but there is no basis to say that emphasizing reading will surely return to the old road of "white expertise." Today's situation is very different from that before the rectification and anti-rightist movement. At that time, had the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts been victorious? No; but today, this revolution has achieved a decisive victory. At that time, had the Party's leadership in scientific and cultural work been established? In some places it was established, in some places it was established but not consolidated, and in some places it was actually not yet established; but today, the Party's leadership has been universally established in science, culture, and education. At that time, what was the ideological outlook of the intellectuals? Most were willing to serve the people, but many still firmly believed that "expertise first, then redness" was the only shortcut to personal development due to their class prejudices and outdated views; but today, the vast majority of intellectuals have acknowledged that politics is the soul, politics is the commander, and redness and expertise must be unified. At that time, intellectuals naturally had many prejudices in their understanding of participating in physical labor, and more importantly, many people lacked personal experience; but today, many people, after a period of practical participation in physical labor, have begun to taste the "sweetness after bitterness" of physical labor, and have recognized that this is indeed an important way for intellectuals to transform and improve themselves… Under these new conditions, what basis is there to say that advocating reading will surely return to the old road of "white expertise"? I think: if a person's purpose in reading is not to pursue some ulterior personal gain, and can read seriously without ignoring politics, then he can read with confidence and read with a happy mood. Don't have ghosts in your heart, and don't be afraid of ghosts at all.
    Of course, the above-mentioned worries are not entirely unfounded. As long as the influence of bourgeois ideology exists for one day, the struggle between the "red expertise road" and the "white expertise road" will not end for one day. Aren't some people saying: "If I had known this, why did I do it in the first place?" What about "in the first place"? Was it wrong for the Party to call for a march towards science? Was it wrong to build a socialist society, counterattack the rightists, and carry out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts? Is it possible to not greatly develop science and culture? When the right-wing elements launched a large-scale offensive against socialism, could we close our doors and read? Was it wrong to criticize the "white expertise road"? Would the working class want to cultivate bourgeois intellectuals? Was it wrong to vigorously carry out the educational revolution? Can education not serve the politics of the working class and can it not be combined with productive labor? So it's not "why did I do it in the first place" at all, but there would be no today without the beginning.
    If I had known this, what does "this" mean? "This" advocates reading, advocating serious reading with politics in command, not closed-door reading that ignores politics. If someone thinks that "this" advocating serious reading proves that their past ideas were correct, then there is no common language.
    I would like to add one point: some people are now proposing "redness inevitably leads to deep expertise," and this statement has problems. It is even more inappropriate as a slogan. You must know that science will never come to the proletariat's door by itself. The higher a person's political consciousness, the greater the motivation to learn, and the more achievements he will have in science, there is no doubt about this. But it would be a big mistake to think that everyone with a firm proletarian stand will naturally become an expert. The great Russian democrat Herzen said it well: "Science is at home everywhere—but it will never be fruitful in any place where it is not sown." He also said, "Science can never be obtained without labor; there is no other way to obtain it except by sweating. Enthusiasm, fantasy, and yearning with all one's heart and soul cannot replace labor. There is no such thing as 'easy science' in the world."

### 读书与“白专”

    读书与“白专”
    成于思
    读书的风气，已日益盛行，这是1959年的新气象。有人耽心：强调读书，会不会像整风反右以前那样，使许多人埋头书本，不问政治，走上“白专道路”？
    提高警惕，十分必要；无穷忧虑，大可不必。此事不妨具体分析一下。
    整风反右以前，有一部分人利用了党号召知识分子向科学进军的口号去追求个人自私的目的；他们提倡“一间屋、两本书”，不问政治，沉醉在名利地位的迷雾之中，结果走上了资产阶级道路，其中有些人甚至堕落成了资产阶级右派分子。这个教训，非常深刻，谁都不应当忘记。
    问题在于那些人之所以走上资产阶级的“白专道路”，甚至堕落成为右派分子，并不是由于读书的结果，而是由于他们腐朽的资产阶级人生观，由于他们拒绝党的领导，厌恶政治。
    整风反右以前出现过的现象，1959年会不会重演？说上述那种人今后绝对不会再有，谁也不能打这个包票；但说强调读书就准会回到“白专”的老路，也并无根据。今天的形势和整风反右以前有很大的不同。那时政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命胜利了没有？没有；而今天，这个革命已取得了决定性的胜利。那时党在科学、文化工作中的领导权树立了没有？有的地方树立了，有的地方则是树立了但并不巩固，有的地方实际上还没有树立；而今天，党的领导权已经在科学、文化、教育事业中普遍树立起来了。那时知识分子的思想面貌是什么呢？大多数是愿意为人民服务的，但不少人还由于自己的阶级偏见和陈腐观点，坚信“先专后红”是发展个人的唯一捷径；而今天，绝大多数的知识分子已经承认：政治是灵魂，政治是统帅，红与专必须统一。那时，知识分子对于参加体力劳动，在认识上固然有许多偏见，更重要的是许多人还缺少亲身体会；而今天，许多人经过一段时间参加体力劳动的实践，已经开始尝到了体力劳动的那种“苦后甘来”的滋味，承认了这的确是知识分子改造和提高的重要途径……。在这些新的条件之下，有什么根据说提倡读书就一定会回到“白专”的老路上去呢？我觉得：如果一个人的读书目的并不是为了追求某种不可告人的私利，能够认真读书而又不忽视政治，就尽可理直气壮地读，心情舒畅地读。自己心中不要有鬼，也根本不必怕鬼。
    当然，上述那种耽心，也并非毫无根据。资产阶级思想影响一天存在，“红专道路”与“白专道路”的斗争，就一天不会结束。有人不是在说吗：“早知如此，何必当初”。“当初”怎么呢？党号召向科学进军不对么？建设社会主义社会、反击右派、进行政治战线思想战线上的社会主义革命难道不对么？难道可以不要大大发展科学文化？难道右派分子向社会主义大举进攻的时候，我们可以关门读书？批判走“白专道路”不对么？难道工人阶级会要培养资产阶级知识分子？大闹教育革命不对么？难道教育可以不为工人阶级的政治服务，可以不与生产劳动相结合？所以根本不是什么“何必当初”，而是没有当初就不会有今天。
    早知如此，“如此”又是什么意思呢？“如此”提倡读书，提倡的是政治挂帅的认真读书，而不是不问政治的关门读书。如果有人认为“如此”提倡认真读书，是证明他们过去的想法正确，那就没有共同的语言了。
    有一点还想补充一下：现在有人提出“红透必然专深”，这种说法有毛病。作为一种口号更不妥当。要知道科学决不会自己走上无产阶级的门来。一个人的政治觉悟越高，学习的动力会更大，在科学上更能有成就，这是毋庸置疑的。但是如果认为一切具有坚定的无产阶级立场的人，就会自然地成为专家，那就大错而特错了。俄国伟大的民主主义者赫尔岑说得好：“科学是到处为家的——不过在任何不播种的地方，决不会得到丰收”。又说，“科学决不能不劳而获，除了汗流满面而外，没有其他获致的方法。热情、幻想、以整个身心去渴望，都不能代替劳动。世界上没有一种‘轻易的科学’”。
