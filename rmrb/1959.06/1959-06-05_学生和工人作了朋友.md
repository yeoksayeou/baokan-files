Students from the first and second grades of the Chinese Department of Peking University lived in Mentougou Coal Mine and Chengzi Coal Mine of Jingxi Mining Bureau for three and a half months. They participated in various underground labor alongside coal miners, including hewing coal, pushing carts, blasting, and drilling, while also studying professional courses. They also visited workers and labor models, compiled biographies of coal mine heroes, mine history, and selections of coal miners' folk songs. They also carried out mine propaganda and performances in conjunction with the central task, helped workers eliminate illiteracy, held amateur art lectures for workers, and engaged in artistic creation with workers. The students often talked about this period of life with excitement. They not only learned a lot of practical production knowledge, but more importantly, received a political and ideological baptism.

Once, a female student named Lu Jia did not observe safety regulations in the mine. Seeing the blasting, she curiously squeezed in to watch. Suddenly, a stone fell from the roof towards her head. A worker saw this and immediately rushed up to push her away, but he himself did not have time to dodge and was injured by the stone. In the critical moment, the noble quality of the worker comrades who sacrificed themselves to save others deeply moved all the students, making them even more disgusted with and determined to break away from the individualism in themselves.

"A pair of glasses, a few books, walking with square steps. Talking about the world under the shade of trees, going to the Summer Palace to tour the lake," this was originally a poem by Cheng Yuzhen, a freshman in the Chinese Department, describing the student life he yearned for. The great debate on educational policy did not completely solve his ideological problems. After going down to the coal mine for labor practice and living with the workers, Cheng Yuzhen transformed in the process of participating in the compilation of the novel "Long Night," which reflected the life of coal miners before and after liberation and the underground struggle of coal miners led by the Party. He humbly learned from the workers, strictly demanded himself, and strived to go to where the work was heavy. No matter what tasks were assigned, he actively and diligently completed them.

Common labor and common life have forged a deep friendship between these college students and coal miners. The students call the coal mine their "second hometown." After returning to school, they often corresponded with their worker mentors. During festivals and holidays, some students would happily go to the mine to visit their old mentors and old friends. When the workers had free time, they also liked to come to Peking University to play. When the mine had any urgent tasks that needed help, they naturally thought of their college student friends. Before "May Day," the Chengzi Coal Mine did not have enough people to draw propaganda posters, so they made a long-distance call, and the second-year students immediately sent the student who was most skilled in painting to help. Li Wen, the secretary of the Chengzi Coal Mine Party Committee, said humorously: Peking University and the coal mine are married!

    学生和工人作了朋友
    北京大学中文系一、二年级全体学生，曾在京西矿务局的门头沟煤矿和城子煤矿生活过三个半月。他们和煤矿工人一道参加和煤、推罐、放炮、打眼等各种井下劳动，一面学习业务课程。他们还访问工人和劳动模范，编写煤矿英雄谱、矿史、煤矿工人歌谣选，结合中心任务开展矿口宣传和演出，帮助工人扫盲，为工人举办业余文艺讲座，和工人一道进行文艺创作。学生们常常怀着激动的心情谈到这一段的生活。他们不仅学到了许多生产实践知识，更重要的是受到一场政治思想上的洗礼。
    有一次，一个叫吕佳的女学生在井下没有遵守安全规程，看到放炮，好奇地挤进去看。突然，顶板上一块石头朝她的头上落下来。一个工人看到，立刻冲上去把她推开，而他自己却来不及躲开被石头打伤了。在紧急关头，工人同志这种舍身为人的高贵品质深深地感动了所有的学生，使他们更加深了对自己身上个人主义思想的鄙弃和决裂。
    “一副眼镜几卷书，走路迈着四方步。树荫底下谈天地，颐和园里去游湖”，这原是中文系一年级学生程裕桢描叙自己所向往的学生生活的一首诗。教育方针的大辩论也没有完全解决他的思想问题。下煤矿经过劳动实践，和工人生活在一起，在他参加编写反映煤矿工人解放前后的生活，和党领导煤矿工人进行地下斗争的小说“长夜”的过程中，程裕桢转变了，他虚心地向工人学习，严格地要求自己，哪儿活重就争取到那儿去劳动，不论分配什么任务，都积极努力地去完成。
    共同的劳动，共同的生活，使这些大学生和煤矿工人结成了深厚的友谊。学生们把煤矿称作他们的
  “第二故乡”。回校以后还和自己的工人师傅经常通信往来。在节日和例假日，总有一些学生欢欢喜喜地去矿上访问老师傅、老朋友，工人们有空时也爱上北大来玩。矿上有什么紧急任务需要帮助，自然就想到他们的大学生朋友。“五一”前夕，城子煤矿绘宣传画的人手不够，打了长途电话来，二年级学生立刻派出了他们当中最擅长绘画的学生，赶去帮忙。城子煤矿党委书记李文风趣地说：北大和煤矿结了亲啦！
