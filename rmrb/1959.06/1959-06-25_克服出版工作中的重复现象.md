    Overcoming Redundancy in Publishing Work

    I have noticed a repetitive phenomenon in the arrangement of newly published books on literary theory and film in recent years.

    In March 1958, I bought a book called "On Problems of Film Scriptwriting" and saw Pavlenko's article, "Life is the Writer's School." The more I read it, the more familiar it seemed, as if I had read it somewhere before. After checking, I found that the same article appeared in the book "On Writing," published by People's Literature Publishing House in May 1955. There was also such an article in the sixth collection of "A Small Collection of Literary and Artistic Theory Translations" published by New Literature and Art Publishing House in 1954. This is not all; I once encountered the following situation: In May 1957, China Film Publishing House published Shi Dongshan's posthumous work: "On the Juxtaposition of Film Shots." I bought this book. However, in September 1958, China Film Publishing House published another book by Shi Dongshan, "Several Characteristics of Film Art in its Expressive Forms," which included "On the Juxtaposition of Film Shots." This put me in a dilemma: If I buy it, the book "On the Juxtaposition of Film Shots" becomes redundant; if I don't buy it, I don't have the article "Several Characteristics of Film Art in its Expressive Forms." I was hesitant and in a difficult position. Because I am a student and my finances are not abundant, I finally had to grit my teeth and buy it. I have encountered similar situations more than once. Repetition in the arrangement of published books is not limited to these examples.

    I believe this situation reflects a lack of planning and coordination in publishing, causing losses and waste to both the state and individuals.

    I hope that the relevant departments pay attention to this issue, strengthen the planning of publishing work, maintain frequent communication, and avoid repetition.

    克服出版工作中的重复现象
    我发现近年来新出版的文学理论和电影方面的书籍，编排上有重复的现象。
    1958年3月我买了一本“论电影剧作问题，”看到了巴甫连科的一篇文章：“生活是作家的学校”，越看越熟，好像在哪儿看过。继而一查，原来是1955年5月人民文学出版社出版的“论写作”一书中，就有同样的一篇文章，1954年新文艺出版社出版的“文艺理论小译丛”第六辑中也有过这样一篇文章。这还不算什么，我曾经遇过这么一件事：1957年5月中国电影出版社出版了史东山的遗著：“论电影镜头的组接”。这本书我买了。但在1958年9月中国电影出版社又出版了一本史东山的“电影艺术在表现形式上的几个特点”，其中包括了“论电影镜头的组接”，于是就把我苦了，买吧，那本“论电影镜头的组接”就多余了；不买吧，那篇“电影艺术在表现形式上的几个特点”我又没有，踌躇不定，左右为难。因为我是个学生，经济还不宽裕，最后只好狠心买下。类似这种情况，我遇到不止一次。在出版书籍中编排上的重复，也不仅仅这些。
    我认为这种情况反映了出版方面的无计划无联系的现象，给国家给个人都造成损失和浪费。
    希望有关方面重视这个问题，加强出版工作的计划性，经常相互联系，避免重复现象。
