Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: The academic year for Soviet higher education institutions has now ended. According to Soviet Minister of Higher Education Yelyutin, speaking to a TASS reporter, a total of more than 340,000 young experts have graduated from higher education institutions across the Soviet Union this year, including 100,000 who graduated from higher evening schools and correspondence schools without leaving production.

Yelyutin said that in the past academic year, many Soviet higher education institutions, in accordance with the decisions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government on strengthening the connection between schools and life and further developing the national education system, began to reorganize their teaching work. Experience has shown that organizing college students to participate in production labor and strengthening the connection between education and production practice can help students better master knowledge.

According to reports in the local newspapers, the work of assigning this year's graduates from Soviet higher education institutions has been completed. Among these young experts, this fall, 90,000 young engineers, more than 30,000 agronomists and other agricultural experts, and approximately 30,000 medical workers will take up their posts according to the needs of the country, their own wishes, and their specialties. During the assignment process, these young experts demonstrated a lofty enthusiasm for building communism, and they all applied to work in the places where the country needs them most and where conditions are the most difficult. This year's graduates from the Moscow Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering unanimously applied to go to the construction sites of the Seven-Year Plan in the eastern and northern regions, saying that they wanted to go to these regions to participate in the "battle" to build communism. Many graduates from other schools in Moscow could have stayed in Moscow, but they all asked to go to Siberia or even the Far North. Their applications expressed their love for creative labor and for the great motherland.

According to newspaper reports, the number of young experts trained by Soviet higher education institutions is increasing every year. In the new academic year beginning on September 1st this year, universities and colleges across the country will enroll 485,000 new students, an increase of 40,000 over the previous academic year. During the entire Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), higher education institutions across the country will train a total of 2.3 million experts. In training young experts, priority will be given to developing higher education networks of evening schools and correspondence schools. This year alone, the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education system plans to open more than 50 permanent higher evening schools and correspondence schools.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: According to Soviet newspaper reports, the Central Asian republics of the Soviet Union, which were culturally very backward before the October Revolution, have now become countries with highly developed culture and education. Currently, on average, one in every four people in these republics is studying in various types of schools, and in terms of the level of higher education development, they have also surpassed many Western countries.

Before 1917, in the Central Asian region of Tsarist Russia, literate people accounted for less than 2% of the total population. After the establishment of Soviet power, the Party and the government consistently implemented correct national policies and vigorously led and helped the various ethnic regions to develop their local economy and culture. Now, there are no longer any illiterate people in the four Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. These four republics have a total population of 13 million people, with a total of 2.3 million people studying in more than 11,900 ordinary schools.

The higher education cause in these republics is also very developed, and the number of students in higher education institutions has exceeded that of many Western countries. Calculated on the average per 10,000 people, the number of experts currently being trained by higher education institutions in the Republic of Uzbekistan is seven times that of Turkey and 1.6 times more than France. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the number of experts being trained is six times and nearly twice that of the above two countries, respectively. Currently, in every 10,000 residents, the Republic of Uzbekistan has 103 college students, the Republic of Turkmenistan has 99 college students, and the Kyrgyz Republic has 64 college students. However, this number is 36 college students in France, 32 college students in Italy, and 21 college students in Switzerland.

The Central Asian republics of the Soviet Union have now established their own Academies of Sciences and many other scientific research institutions. In these scientific institutions, there are currently more than 300 Doctors of Science and more than 4,460 associate professors and associate doctors of science engaged in various scientific research work.

The publishing industry in these republics is also quite developed now, and a network of cultural institutions such as libraries, cinemas, theaters, cultural palaces, and clubs has spread throughout cities, industrial centers, and the vast countryside. (Attached picture)

    苏联今年有三十四万青年专家结束学业基
    服从国家需要走上工作岗位
    中亚各加盟共和国高等教育达到很高水平
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联高等学校的这一学年现在已经结束。据苏联高等教育部部长叶留金对塔斯社记者说，今年全苏联各高等学校总共有三十四万以上的青年专家毕业，其中有十万人是没有脱离生产而从高等夜校和函授学校学习毕业的。
    叶留金说，在过去一学年里，苏联许多高等学校根据苏联共产党和政府关于加强学校同生活的联系以及进一步发展国民教育制度的决定，开始改组了教学工作。经验证明，组织大学生参加生产劳动，加强教育和生产实践的联系，可以帮助学生更好地掌握知识。
    据此间报纸报道，苏联各高等学校这一届毕业生的分配工作的工作已经结束。在这些青年专家中，今年秋季，将有九万名青年工程师、三万多名农艺师和其他农业专家和约三万名医务工作者根据国家的需要以及自己的志愿和专长走上工作岗位。在分配工作时，这些青年专家表现了崇高的建设共产主义的热情，他们都申请到国家最需要和最艰苦的地方去工作。莫斯科古比雪夫建筑工程学院这一届毕业生在分配工作时，都一致申请去东部和北部地区的七年计划建设工地，他们说，他们要到这些地区去参加建设共产主义的“战斗”。莫斯科其他一些学校的毕业生中，有许多人本来可以留在莫斯科市工作，但是，他们都要求到西伯利亚甚至极北地区去工作。在他们的申请书中，表现了对创造性劳动、对伟大祖国的热爱。
    据报纸报道，苏联高等学校培养的青年专家每年都在增加。在从今年9月1日开始的新学年里，全国各大学和学院将招收四十八万五千名新生，比上一学年招收的名额又增加了四万人。而在整个七年计划（1959—1965年）期间，全国高等学校总共将培养出二百三十万名专家。在培养青年专家时，将首先注意发展高等夜校和函授学校教育网。单是今年，苏联高等教育部系统就计划再开办五十多个常设的高等夜校和函授学校。
    新华社莫斯科19日电　据苏联报纸报道：十月革命以前文化十分落后的苏联中亚细亚各加盟共和国，现在已变成文化教育高度发达的国家。目前，这些共和国里平均每四个人中就有一个人在各种类型的学校中学习，从高等教育发展的水平来看，它们也已超过了许多西方国家。
    1917年以前，在沙皇俄国的中亚细亚地区，识字的人还占不到居民人口总数的2％。在苏维埃政权建立以后，党和政府一贯实行了正确的民族政策，大力领导和帮助各民族地区发展当地的经济和文化，现在，在中亚细亚的乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯、塔吉克和土库曼四个共和国里早已没有了文盲。这四个共和国总共有一千三百万人口，共有二百三十万人在一万一千九百多个普通学校里学习。
    这些共和国的高等教育事业也非常发达，高等学校的学生人数已经超过了许多西方国家。按每一万人口平均计算，乌兹别克共和国各高等学校目前正在培养的专家人数等于土耳其的七倍，比法国还多一点六倍。在吉尔吉斯共和国，正在培养的专家人数则分别相当于上述两个国家的六倍和将近二倍。现在，在每一万个居民中，乌兹别克共和国有一百零三个大学生，土库曼共和国有九十九个大学生，吉尔吉斯共和国有六十四个大学生。然而，这个数字在法国是三十六个大学生，在意大利是三十二个大学生，在瑞士是二十一个大学生。
    苏联中亚细亚各加盟共和国现在都设立了本共和国的科学院以及其他许多科学研究机构。在这些科学机构中，目前有三百多名科学博士、四千四百六十多名大学副教授和科学副博士在进行各种科学研究工作。
    这些共和国的出版事业现在也相当发达，图书馆、电影院、剧院、文化宫、俱乐部等文化机构网已经遍布各地城市、工业中心和广大农村。（附图片）
