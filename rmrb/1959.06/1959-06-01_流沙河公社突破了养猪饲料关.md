    Liusha River Commune Breaks Through the Pig Feed Barrier
    By our reporter Hu Jian
    The Liusha River People's Commune in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, ensures that pig feed is not lacking in the off-season, is stored in the peak season, and is connected month by month, which promotes the development of both public and private pig raising. As of May 20th, the commune had more than 20,000 pigs (an average of more than two per household), an increase of 11% compared to the end of April. The private pig-raising business of commune members has developed rapidly recently. As of May 20th, 3,460 households in the commune had raised 3,564 pigs. Private pig-raising households account for 38.4% of the total number of households currently able to raise pigs. More than 5,000 sows in the commune are pregnant, and one to two hundred piglets are born every day since May. People are full of confidence in striving to achieve the plan of developing 90,000 pigs in the whole commune this year.
    The Liusha River People's Commune has more than 12,000 households and more than 40,000 people. It is a region with a large population and little land. The masses have always had the habit of raising pigs, and the high-quality pigs here are famous throughout the country. Every year, three to four thousand high-quality piglets are supplied to other places. Historically, income from pig raising has accounted for about 30% to 40% of farmers' total income. With the great development of pig raising, the contradiction between the increasing demand for feed and the seasonality of feed production has become increasingly acute. Last winter, some pig farms experienced a tense situation where feed supply could not be maintained. The Party Committee of the Commune seriously studied this issue and determined that a Party Committee Secretary should be specifically responsible for pig and feed production, established a system of dedicated personnel at all levels, conducted regular evaluations and inspections, summarized and exchanged the experiences of the masses in comprehensive utilization of feed land over the years, and comprehensively planned according to the needs of pig development and the growing seasons of different feeds, with specific arrangements made month by month, finally breaking through the feed barrier.
    Dedicated personnel and dedicated land, crop rotation and intercropping are an important experience in solving the feed problem. After communization last year, the collective pig-raising business developed greatly. The entire commune allocated more than 2,200 mu of dry land as a feed base, generally with more than one fen of land per pig. At the same time, more than 360 experienced farmers in feed planting were organized to form 119 feed professional teams. A method of dedicated personnel and dedicated land, contracting land to households, calculating work points based on output, and rewarding overproduction was implemented to mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members. Generally, land and fertilizer are fixed. For every 100 jin of green feed delivered, one and a half work points are recorded. The higher the yield of feed land, the more work points are recorded, and the more labor remuneration the commune members receive. As a result, commune members have used their brains to rotate and intercrop crops to increase feed production. For example, radish greens are intercropped in cattle hide vegetable fields, and amaranth is intercropped in sweet potato fields. The previous feed has just been harvested, and the next feed has grown. Batch after batch, link after link, ensuring that every inch of land is utilized and that it is green all year round. According to the experience of this commune, a piece of feed land can be rotated and intercropped six or seven times a year. One pig per fen of land, if managed well, will have enough to eat and even have a surplus.
    Recently, in order to support commune members' private pig raising, the entire commune, without affecting the grain production increase plan, has adopted methods such as fully utilizing open spaces and adjusting surpluses and deficits, allocating more than 780 mu of feed land to commune members, and at the same time issuing one jin of seeds such as amaranth and buckwheat to each pig-raising commune member, and mobilizing commune members to plant melons and vegetables in front of and behind their houses. Thirty-six "pumpkin mountains" have appeared throughout the commune, with a total of more than 310,000 pumpkin seedlings planted. The ponds are also full of green pig feed.
    According to the experience here, silage feed, a small but steady stream, is a good way to solve the contradiction between the perennial need for feed and the seasonality of feed production. During the peak season of green feed production, they mobilized everyone to carry out a silage feed campaign. Last year, during the sweet potato harvesting season, they mobilized commune members to ensile more than 2.14 million jin of sweet potato vines, and most pig farms ensured the winter feed for pigs. In early spring this year, when green manure was in full bloom, the entire commune ensiled more than 890,000 jin, enough for more than 10,000 pigs to eat for a month. At the same time, according to the growing seasons of different feeds, they sow in batches, linking ring after ring, so that pigs always have feed to eat.
    The experience of this commune proves that combining agricultural activities with the collection of wild feed is a good thing that achieves multiple goals. Recently, the Gaoshan Brigade, in conjunction with rice field mid-tillage weeding, the professional pig farm purchased wild feed from commune members in cash, and purchased more than 180,000 jin in one month. This can not only supplement the shortage of green feed, but also mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members for mid-tillage and weeding of crops. By utilizing wild green feed, some feed land can be vacated to plant miscellaneous grain crops to supplement the shortage of concentrated feed.
    Crushing and processing, and using coarse materials finely, is also a good way to solve the difficulty of concentrated feed. Feed processing plants have been established in the commune, using water mills, ox mills, and eighteen kinds of agricultural and sideline products such as sweet potato husks, bean pods, sorghum stalks, corn cobs, concave valleys, and rapeseed pods, dried and roasted, mixed with four jin of rice per hundred jin, crushed and processed, turning waste materials into concentrated feed. The pigs love to eat this kind of processed concentrated feed, and they grow fast. According to a typical survey at the end of April, the rate of weight gain of pigs increased by about half compared to January.

    流沙河公社突破了养猪饲料关
    本报记者　胡坚
    湖南省宁乡县流沙河人民公社生猪饲料淡季不缺、旺季有贮、月月衔接，促进了公私养猪事业的发展。到5月20日止，全公社存栏猪两万多头（平均每户两头多），较4月底存栏数增加11％。社员私人养猪事业，最近发展很快。到5月20日止，全公社已有三千四百六十户社员养了三千五百六十四头猪。私人养猪户占目前有条件养猪的总户数的38.4％。全公社有五千多头母猪配种怀孕，5月以来每天有一两百头小猪出世。人们满怀信心地争取实现今年全社发展生猪九万头的计划。
    流沙河人民公社有一万二千多户、四万多人口，是一个人多田少的地区，群众历来有养猪习惯，而且这里的良种猪驰名全国，每年供应外地的良种小猪有三、四万头。历来养猪收入约占农民总收入的30％到40％。随着生猪大发展，饲料需要量日益增加与饲料生产有季节性之间的矛盾，越来越尖锐。去年冬天，有些养猪场一度发生饲料供应不上的紧张局面。公社党委会认真研究了这个问题，并确定了一个党委书记专门抓生猪和饲料生产，层层建立专人负责制度，定期开展评比检查，总结和交流群众中历年来综合利用饲料地的经验，根据生猪发展的需要和不同饲料的生长季节，全面规划，逐段逐月地具体安排后，终于突破了饲料关。
    专人专地，轮种套种，是解决饲料问题的一条重要经验。去年公社化后，集体养猪事业大发展，全公社拨出二千二百多亩旱地作为饲料基地，一般每头猪有一分多地。同时，组织了三百六十多名有种饲料经验的老农，成立一百一十九个饲料专业队。实行专人专地、划地包干、按产计工、超产奖励的办法，以调动社员的积极性。一般定地定肥料，每交一百斤青饲料，记一分半工。饲料地产量越高，记的工分多，社员的劳动报酬也越多。于是，社员们都开动脑筋，轮种套种，提高饲料产量。比如，牛皮菜地里套种萝卜菜，红薯地里套种苋菜。前面的饲料刚收割，后面的饲料又长起来了。一批接一批，一环扣一环，做到寸土不闲，四季常青。根据这个公社的经验，一块饲料地轮种套作，一年可收六、七次。一头猪一分地，经营得好，有吃有余。
    最近，为了扶植社员私人养猪，全公社在不影响粮食增产计划的前提下，采取充分利用空坪隙地、余缺调剂等办法，划给社员七百八十多亩饲料地，同时每头猪发给社员一斤苋菜、荞麦等种子，并发动社员在屋前屋后种瓜菜。全社已出现三十六个“南瓜山”，共种南瓜三十一万多兜。池塘里也到处是一片葱绿的猪饲料。
    根据这里的经验，青贮饲料，细水长流，是解决生猪常年需要饲料与饲料生产季节性矛盾的好办法。他们在青饲料生产的旺季，发动大家开展青贮饲料运动。去年收割红薯的季节，发动社员青贮红薯藤二百十四万多斤，大部分养猪场保证了生猪的过冬饲料。今年初春，当绿肥盛长的时候，全社又青贮八十九万多斤，够一万多头猪搭配着吃一个月。同时，根据不同饲料的生长季节，分批播种，环环相套，做到生猪经常有饲料吃。
    这个公社的经验证明：结合农事活动，采集野生饲料，是一件一举数得的好事情。最近高山大队结合稻田中耕除草，专业养猪场以现金向社员收购野生饲料，一个月中就收购了十八万多斤。这样既能够补青饲料之不足，又能调动广大社员对农作物中耕除草的积极性。利用了野生青饲料，就腾出一部分饲料地播种杂粮作物，以补精饲料之不足。
    粉碎加工，粗料细用，也是解决精饲料困难的一条好办法。公社里建立了饲料加工厂，利用水碓、牛碾、把红薯兜、豆壳、高粱秆、玉米心、凹谷、油菜荚等十八种农副产品，晒干炒枯，每一百斤掺四斤大米，加工粉碎，把废料变成了精饲料。经过加工的这种精饲料，猪爱吃，也长得快。根据4月底的典型调查，生猪长肉率比1月份提高一半左右。
