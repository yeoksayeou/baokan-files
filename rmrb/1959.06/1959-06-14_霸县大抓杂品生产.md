Ba County Vigorously Promotes Production of Sundry Goods

(Our report) Ba County, Hebei Province, is taking various measures to vigorously promote the production of daily-use sundry goods.

Ba County has a relatively good foundation for the production of daily-use woven goods, with a wide variety of products and abundant raw materials. It has always had the techniques and habits of production. Since last winter, in order to comprehensively develop the rural economy, the county, following the principle of promoting agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery simultaneously, and combining self-sufficiency production with commodity production, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, has carried out comprehensive planning and unified arrangements, launched diverse economic operations, and adopted the methods of "two-pronged approach" (arranging and acting simultaneously), "three grasps" (grasping domestic and wild raw materials simultaneously, grasping large and small industries simultaneously, grasping both production with own raw materials and processing for other places simultaneously), and "four combinations" (combining agriculture and sideline occupations, combining specialized and part-time work, combining crash production and normal production, combining collective and individual efforts), which quickly set off a massive upsurge of diversified operations. Statistics from November 26 last year to May 25 this year show that the total value of various reed mats, reed screens, willow woven products, grass sacks, grass ropes, etc., reached more than 26 million yuan, with a profit of more than 21 million yuan, an average income of about 35 yuan per agricultural person in the county.

The great development of daily-use sundry goods production not only met the needs of the local people's lives, but also strongly supported the needs of cities and other places. According to statistics as of May 25, the materials supplied to Beijing, Tianjin, and other places through the commercial departments alone included 490,000 reed mats, 140,000 willow woven products, 40,000 wooden articles, 400,000 jin of thread rope, 40,000 grass sacks, and many other daily-use sundry goods and industrial raw materials.

The reason why Ba County's daily-use sundry goods production has been so successful, in addition to the leadership of the Party committee, comprehensive planning, and unified arrangements, is mainly due to the full play given to the production enthusiasm of the communes, management districts, production teams, and commune members. The division of labor is roughly as follows: those that are technically strong, require a lot of capital, and are highly marketable are managed by the communes, and all income belongs to the communes; those that are small-scale, seasonal, technically undemanding, and require little capital are managed by the management districts or production teams, and after completing the task of handing over to the higher levels, all or 80% of the excess income belongs to the management districts and production teams; sporadic ones that are not convenient for collective production are managed by individual commune members, and all income belongs to the commune members. They also, based on the principle that it is both conducive to the consolidation and improvement of the communes and can mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, decentralized some of the specialized teams (factories) originally operated by the people's communes and management districts throughout the county to the production teams. In order to help production teams with weak economic strength and poor sideline production foundation develop production, the county commercial bureau specially sent cadres to go deep into these production teams to specifically help arrange labor and solve technical and raw material problems.

    霸县大抓杂品生产
    本报讯　河北省霸县采取各种措施，大抓日用杂品生产。
    霸县是日用编制品生产基础较好的一个地区，品种繁多，原料充足，历来就有生产的技术和习惯。去冬以来，为了全面地发展农村经济，这个县本着农、林、牧、副、渔五业并举，自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针，在各级党委的领导下，进行了全面规划，统一安排，开展了多种经济经营，并采取了“两边”（边安排、边行动）、“三抓”（家生野生原料一齐抓、大小行业一齐抓、自有原料生产和给外地加工一齐抓）和“四结合”（农副业结合、专业与兼业结合、突击生产与正常生产结合、集体与分散结合）的办法，迅速地掀起了一个声势浩大的多种经营高潮。从去年11月26日到今年5月25日的统计，生产的各种苇席、苇箔、柳编制品、草袋、草绳等，总值达二千六百多万元，获利二千一百多万元，全县平均每个农业人口收入三十五元左右。
    日用杂品生产大发展，不但满足了当地人民生活的需要，而且还有力地支援了城市和外地的需要。截至5月25日的统计，仅通过商业部门供应北京、天津等地的物资，就有苇席四十九万片，柳编品十四万件，木器四万件，线绳四十万斤，草袋四万条及很多其他的日用杂品和工业原料。
    霸县日用杂品的生产所以搞得这样好，除了党委领导，全面规划、统一安排外，主要是充分地发挥了公社、管理区、生产队和社员的生产积极性。其分工大体是：技术性强，占用资金多，商品性大的归公社经营，收入全部归公社所有；小型的、季节性的、技术不高的、占用资金不多的归管理区或生产队经营，其收入在完成上缴任务后，超额部分全部或80％归管理区和生产队；零星的不便于集体生产的归社员个人经营，收入全部归社员所有。他们还根据既有利于公社巩固和提高，又能调度各方面的积极性的原则，将全县人民公社和管理区原来经营的专业队（厂），下放一部分给生产队。为了帮助原来经济力量薄弱和副业生产基础较差的生产队发展生产，县商业局专门派出干部深入这些生产队里具体帮助安排劳动力，解决生产技术和原料问题。
