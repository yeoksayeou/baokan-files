    Laziness and Rust
    Wang Chong
    Someone once said, "Laziness, like rust, consumes the body more easily than hard work." I think the meaning of this sentence is very profound. Because it illustrates a truth: everything can only survive and develop in motion. If things are in a static, conservative state, from the surface it seems that there is no loss, but in fact, they have lost the most important vitality for survival and development. "Running water does not stagnate, and a door hinge does not rot." Why? In fact, there is no mystery. It is precisely because they are all in motion.
    People cannot violate this objective law either. Therefore, a love of labor is human nature. This is not only to obtain the means of livelihood, but also a need for one's own physiological development. Labor, on the surface, seems to consume one's energy, but in reality, it is exchanged for vigor and longevity.
    The same is true for physical labor, and the situation for mental labor is exactly the same. The brain is a wonderful organ. The less you use it, the more sluggish and clumsy it becomes; the more you use your brain, the more abundant the source of water, just like digging a well. This is the reason for "diligence can make up for clumsiness." Many young friends fantasize about "genius" falling from the sky: wishing to wake up one day and become smarter and more agile; "in the blink of an eye, an old hen turns into a duck"; they look forward to the early arrival of "inspiration," and as long as "inspiration" comes, they can write tens of thousands of words in no time. However, I seem to remember Tchaikovsky saying that inspiration does not like to visit lazy people. If you do not spend a certain price, do not pay a certain amount of labor, "inspiration" will naturally not be willing to visit you. Beethoven is a world-renowned genius and artistic master. However, Beethoven started with the simplest fingering. It is said that when he practiced fingering as a child, his small fingers became hot on the keyboard, and he had to put a basin of cold water next to him, playing while soaking his fingers in the cold water, resulting in the floor and the piano getting wet. It can be seen that genius is not something mysterious. Genius is actually the son of diligence. A person who works diligently has already secretly watered and fertilized the seeds of his "genius."

    懒惰和生锈
    王重
    有人说过，“懒惰，像生锈一样，比操劳更易消耗体质。”我觉得这句话的含义是很深邃的。因为它说明了一个真理：一切事物只有在运动中才能得到生存、才能得到发展。如果事物处于静止的、保守的状态，从表面上看来并没有什么损耗，但是，实际上却失去了借以生存和发展的最为重要的生命力。“流水不腐，户枢不蠹。”为什么？其实，并无奥妙之处，正是因为它们都在运动着的缘故。
    人，也不能违反这一条客观规律。所以，爱劳动是人们的天性。这不仅是为了要得到生活资料，而且也是自身生理发展上的需要。劳动，表面上看去是使人消耗了精力，而实际上是换得了精力充沛、延年益寿。
    体力劳动如此，脑力劳动的情况也完全一样。头脑，真是一个奇妙的器官，你越不用它，它就变得越迟钝、越笨拙；你经常开动脑筋，它就像挖井一样，挖得越深，水源越足。这便是“勤能补拙”的道理。有许多青年朋友幻想“天才”从天而降：但愿一觉醒来，变得更聪明伶俐起来；“眼睛一霎，老母鸡变鸭”；他们期待着“灵感”早日到来，只要“灵感”一来，就可以洋洋万言，倚马可待。但是，记得好像是柴可夫斯基说过：灵感是不喜欢拜访懒惰人的。如果你不花出一定的代价，不付出一定的劳动，“灵感”自然也就不肯来拜访你。贝多芬是举世公认的天才和艺术大师。但是，贝多芬却是从最简单的指法学起的。据说，当他从小练习指法的时候，小小的手指在键盘上弹得发烫，最后不得不用一盆冷水放在旁边，一边弹，一边浸冷水，结果地上、琴上都弄得湿漉漉的。由此可见，天才并不是什么神秘莫测的东西。天才，其实是勤劳的儿子。一个人在勤劳地工作，便已经暗暗地给自己的“天才”的种子浇水、施肥了。
