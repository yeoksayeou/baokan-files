	The Epistemological Roots of Religion

	Only under certain social conditions and under the influence of certain social factors can human consciousness produce religion.

	Religion is not created "out of thin air." Religion originates from sensory material, which humans obtain from reality and which is distorted in the further activities of human consciousness.

	The dynamism of human thinking is expressed in imagination and fantasy. Imagination helps people foresee the future, anticipate the results of their practical activities, and delve into the unknown areas of the real world in thought. However, under certain conditions, imagination can detach people from reality and lead to fantasies. Reality can be distorted by thinking in a fantastic way.

	The distortion of reality by fantasy (which ultimately produces religion) is closely related to human feelings of fear. Fear is one of the important prerequisites for the emergence and existence of religion. The famous saying quoted by Lenin, "Fear created God," means just that.

	In antagonistic class societies, fear is not only caused by the oppression of natural forces on people, but also by social forces that are opposed to people. The fear of losing one's job and becoming a beggar is a factor in the existence of religion in modern capitalist society. Various theological theories attempt to portray love for God as the foundation of religion. Contrary to these theories, the facts irrefutably prove that among all emotions, only fear is the factor that preserves people's religious views.

	The emergence and existence of religion are closely related to metaphysical ways of thinking. Metaphysical views of real objects and phenomena can become the epistemological roots of religion under certain conditions.

	Metaphysical ways of thinking can lead people to misunderstand the relationship between the absolute and the relative. The metaphysical method exaggerates the role of relative things, separating them completely from absolute things. This path leads to relativism, and through relativism to subjective idealism. But the metaphysical method can also exaggerate the role of absolute things, which under certain historical conditions will ultimately lead to objective idealism and religion. Religion absolutizes individual principles, turning them into doctrines. Contrary to scientific principles, religious doctrines do not have the nature of objective truth because they are incorrect reflections of reality, distorted by fantasy. Therefore, the history of the development of human knowledge and the history of science are also the history of the struggle between science and religion.

	Religion is a form of objective idealism. Religion is the crudest and most primitive form of idealism, while idealist philosophy is a sophisticated form of religion. Marxist classics have repeatedly pointed out the fundamental similarities between idealist philosophy and religion.

	However, idealist philosophy and religion also have certain differences. Unlike philosophical idealism, religion, after extracting individual characteristics of reality, not only turns them into independent essences but also gives them the images of concrete beings, which naturally exist only in imagination. Therefore, it can be said that religion is idealism in image form. Religious thought is largely embodied in image form. Therefore, religion is more easily accepted by the masses than idealist philosophy, which uses vague and abstract concepts that are little understood by the masses. Because religion has an image form, which makes many religious works artistically meaningful, religion can act as an opiate of the people.

	It cannot be assumed that religion is completely isolated from practice. To believe that religion is isolated from practice and formed and developed outside of and independently of practice is an idealist view, because idealism believes that the formation and development of religion is due either to the internal abilities of thinking or to the internal abilities of religion itself. Of course, religion can only make a summary of practice distorted by fantasy.

	Religion arises because of the low level of development of practice. The masses of people cannot yet believe in the unfounded nature of the religious worldview in practice. On the contrary, the practice of the masses themselves—production practice and class struggle practice—has for thousands of years promoted the preservation and spread of religion among the people. However, under the capitalist system, the situation is fundamentally changed. With the development of capitalism, its gravedigger—the proletariat—is also growing stronger.

	From then on, practice has increasingly convinced the broad masses of people that they can defeat the exploiters.

	Therefore, within the scope of capitalist society, atheism has already been spreading widely among the most advanced and conscious workers. Atheism has changed from the worldview of a few individuals to the worldview of the masses. Atheism is an integral part of the proletarian worldview.

	In order for practice to become the standard by which the masses of people correctly evaluate religion, there must be a fairly high level of all practical activities of the masses themselves. Only the practice of socialism and communism can expose the unfounded nature of religion and expose its reactionary essence to all the people. (Excerpted from the Soviet magazine "Philosophical Sciences," No. 4, 1958, by A. Sukhov)

	Eliminating the Essential Differences Between Mental and Manual Labor

	The division of labor between mental and manual labor, which arose at a certain stage of social development, once had positive significance: this division of labor accelerated the development of productive forces and promoted social progress. However, within the scope of exploitative society, the division of these two forms of human activity not only has the nature of opposition between the two, but also the nature of antagonism between manual laborers and mental laborers.

	The differences between mental and manual labor, and between mental laborers and manual laborers, that exist under the socialist system have essential and non-essential differences. Essential differences are primarily those differences that reflect the remnants of cultural inequality between manual laborers and mental laborers. These differences are essentially temporary and will be overcome in communist society. Non-essential differences are inherent in the nature of manual and mental labor. These differences reflect the difference between labor that produces goods and labor that produces ideas, and all the characteristics of the means, functions, and conditions of each labor that arise from this. Non-essential differences will also be preserved under the communist system.

	Of course, in making such a distinction, it would be unreasonable to ignore the intersection of essential and non-essential differences, their commonalities, and their dependence on the conditions of social production. For example, in the communist system there will be a new division of labor, a relative independence of spiritual life, and the function of managing social production, etc., but there will be no social differences between manual laborers and mental laborers. The process of overcoming the essential differences between mental and manual labor will also change the non-essential differences to a large extent, because these differences are also affected by the modes of production of material and spiritual life.

	Raising the cultural and technical level of workers and peasants to the level of intellectuals is an extremely important and major aspect of the cause of eliminating the essential differences between mental laborers and manual laborers.

	However, we must not ignore the fact that the progress of science and technology also forces intellectuals to constantly improve their knowledge. Due to the special conditions and complexity of mental labor under the socialist system, it is still necessary for these workers to have a higher cultural and technical level. Socialist society trains a certain number of mental laborers to meet the needs of material production and spiritual production. Due to economic reasons, society at the current stage of development cannot give all its members the same training as intellectuals. In the process of building communism, the nature of mental and manual labor will further change, and society will be able to complete this task.

	At the same time, this complex problem cannot be reduced to one of its aspects (although it is an extremely important aspect), that is, reducing it to the participation of manual laborers in mental activities. Undoubtedly, this is a two-way process, which also requires intellectuals, especially the growing generation, to harmoniously combine mental labor with manual labor. The practice of communist construction will tell us what form mental laborers will take to participate in manual labor that is beneficial to society. However, the practice of communist construction has now proved that people who alternate between manual labor and mental labor are more efficient and more creative. This is true of production innovators, rationalization proposers, inventors, and worker-peasant activists who carry out major socio-political work.

	Defending the Theory of the Proletarian Dictatorship

	Marxists deny the existence of a special "middle class," but admit the existence of intermediate strata, and acknowledge the significance and certain role of these strata in political struggles. These intermediate strata cannot constitute a special class, first of all because they are economically and politically different. These strata include representatives of all classes, social groups, and social strata. In modern conditions, it is extremely important to be good at determining what position each group of these middle strata will take in the political struggle. Therefore, the issue of the middle strata is essentially the issue of the allies of the working class in the struggle against reactionary forces, against the fascist threat, and in defense of peace.

	However, opportunist theorists believe that it is important to prove something else: they want to prove that the "middle class" is becoming an independent economic and political force, that the middle class is annexing the proletariat; in this way, the issue of the proletarian dictatorship can also be removed from the agenda! To this end, they have also come up with a whole set of arguments to prove that the status of the proletariat is "improving," and that this "improvement" is turning the proletariat into the "middle class."

	Reformists use the fact that the wages of some workers in individual countries have increased to insist that there is no longer a process of proletarian impoverishment in modern capitalist society. At the same time, they insist that Marx had a very absurd view of impoverishment, that is, that impoverishment is the continuous and day-by-day deterioration of the material conditions of the working class, without any counteracting factors. As everyone knows, Marxists have long refuted this vulgarized view of Marx's theory of impoverishment. Lenin pointed out that, in addition to the trend of impoverishment, Marx also put forward another trend that is contrary to this—the actual struggle of the working masses to improve their living standards. Only in the absence of this struggle is the trend of impoverishment a truly continuous deterioration of the conditions of the proletariat.

	Modern opportunists like to say that the phenomenon of class struggle can still be seen in backward countries, but it has long been eliminated in developed countries.

	This is a complete fabrication. The scale of the working class's strike movement is an important sign of the intensification of class struggle in major capitalist countries. Statistics show that the number of strikes has increased, not decreased, precisely in those countries that opportunists tout as examples of "class harmony." Moreover, the problem is not only the number of strikes. The problem also lies in the nature of the demands put forward by the workers and the extent to which other resident strata participate in the strike struggle.

	The revolutionary class struggle of the proletariat has forced the bourgeois state to make various concessions: the proletariat has won certain improvements in its material conditions in the course of class struggle, and sometimes even has a certain influence on the political line of this or that bourgeois government. The struggle to defend peace led by the proletariat is the most important factor in curbing the forces of imperialist aggression.

	However, it is wrong and harmful to think that the working class has achieved such a position in capitalist society that it can have a decisive influence on the entire policy of the state. This view would distort the actual relations within capitalist society and would create an illusion of detachment from the actual tasks of class struggle. When explaining the argument that the influence of the proletariat is constantly growing, Yugoslav revisionists believe that the proletariat has become a factor in determining the policy of the bourgeois state, and therefore there is no need to fight for the proletarian dictatorship.

    国外学术论文摘要
    “学术译丛”第六期今日出版，下面是其中三篇译文的摘要
    宗教的认识论根源
    只有在一定的社会条件下，在一定社会因素的影响下，人的意识才能产生宗教。
    宗教不是“凭空”创立的。宗教产生于感性材料，这种感性材料是人从现实中获得的，并且在人类意识的进一步活动过程中遭到歪曲。
    人类思维的能动性表现在想像、幻想中。想像帮助人预见未来，预料自己实践活动的结果，在思想上深入现实世界的未知领域。但是，在一定的条件下，想像可能使人脱离现实，使人产生空想。现实可能被思维以幻想的方式所歪曲。
    幻想对现实的歪曲（这种歪曲终究会产生宗教）同人对现实的恐惧感有密切联系。恐惧是宗教产生和存在的重要前提之一。列宁所引用的一句名言：“恐惧创造了神”，就是这个意思。
    在对抗性阶级社会中，恐惧不仅是
  由自然力对人的压抑所造成，而且是由与人对立的社会力量所造成。害怕失去工作，变成乞丐，这是现代资本主义社会中存在宗教的一个因素。各种神学理论企图把对神的爱说成是宗教的基础。和这些理论相反，事实无可辩驳地证明，在所有情绪中，只有恐惧才是保存人们宗教观点的因素。
    宗教的产生和存在同形而上学的思维方法有密切联系。对现实的对象和现象的形而上学观点，在一定条件下可能成为宗教的认识论根源。
    形而上学的思维方法会使人不正确地理解绝对和相对的相互关系。形而上学的方法使人夸大相对东西的作用，把相对的东西和绝对的东西截然分开。这条道路通向相对主义，并经过相对主义通向主观唯心主义。但是形而上学的方法也可能夸大绝对东西的作用，而这在一定的历史条件下终究会导致客观唯心主义和宗教。宗教把个别原理绝对化，把它们变成教义。与科学原理相反，宗教的教义没有客观真理的性质，因为它们是现实的不正确的、被幻想所歪曲的反映。因此，人类知识发展史、科学史同时也是科学与宗教斗争的历史。
    宗教是客观唯心主义的一种形式。宗教是最粗糙的、原始的唯心主义形式。而唯心主义哲学是精致的宗教形式。马克思主义经典作家不止一次地指出了唯心主义哲学和宗教之间带有原则性的相似之处。
    但是，唯心主义哲学和宗教也有一定的差别。和哲学唯心主义不同，宗教抽出现实的个别特性之后，不仅把它们变成独立的本质，而且使它们具有具体生物的形象，而这些形象自然只存在于想像中。因此可以说，宗教是具有形象形式的唯心主义。宗教思想大部分体现在形象形式中。所以，比起那个运用含糊的、为群众很少了解的抽象概念的唯心主义哲学来，宗教就更容易为人民群众所接受。由于宗教具有形象形式，而形象形式又使许多宗教著作富有艺术意味，所以宗教才能起到麻醉人民的鸦片烟的作用。
    不能认为宗教是和实践完全隔绝的。要知道，断定宗教是和实践隔绝的，是在实践之外和不依赖于实践而形成和发展的，这是一种唯心主义观点，因为唯心主义认为，宗教的形成和发展或者是由于思维的内在能力，或者是由于宗教本身的内在能力。当然，宗教只能对实践作出被幻想所歪曲的概括。
    宗教是由于实践发展水平很低而产生的。人民群众在实践中还不能相信宗教世界观的毫无根据。相反地，人民群众的实践本身——生产实践和阶级斗争实践，几千年来促使了宗教的保存和在人民当中的传播。但是，在资本主义制度下，情况就根本改变了。随着资本主义的发展，它的掘墓人——无产阶级也在成长壮大。
    从此实践就日益使广大人民群众相信自己能够战胜剥削者。
    因此，在资本主义社会范围内，无神论就已经在最先进的和有觉悟的工人当中日益广泛地传播起来。无神论由个别人的世界观变成群众的世界观。无神论是无产阶级世界观的组成部分。
    为了使实践成为人民群众正确评价宗教的标准，就必须有人民群众本身全部实践活动的相当高的水平。只有社会主义和共产主义的实践才能揭露宗教的毫无根据和揭穿它对全体人民的反动本质。（摘自苏联“哲学科学”杂志1958年第4期，作者是阿·苏霍夫）
    消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的本质差别
    在社会发展一定阶段上产生的脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工，曾经有过积极的意义：这种分工加速了生产力的发展，促进了社会进步。但是，在剥削社会范围内，人类活动的这两种形式的分工，不仅带有两者对立的性质，而且带有体力劳动者和脑力劳动者对抗的性质。
    社会主义制度下存在着的体力劳动和脑力劳动之间以及体力劳动者和脑力劳动者之间的差别，有本质和非本质之分。本质差别首先是那些反映体力劳动者和脑力劳动者之间文化不平等残余的差别。这些差别实质上是暂时的，在共产主义社会会得到克服的。而非本质差别是体力劳动和脑力劳动的性质所固有的。这些差别反映生产物品的劳动和生产思想的劳动的差别，以及由此而产生的每一种劳动的手段、职能和条件的一切特点。非本质差别在共产主义制度下也会保存下来。
    当然，在作这样的区分的时候，如果忽视本质差别和非本质差别的交错情形、它们的共同点，它们对社会生产条件的依赖性，那是不合理的。例如，在共产主义制度下有新的分工，有精神生活的相对独立性，有管理社会生产的职能等等，但不会有体力劳动者和脑力劳动者之间的社会差别。克服脑力劳动和体力劳动之间本质差别的过程，在很大的程度上也会改变非本质差别，因为这些差别也受到物质生活和精神生活的生产方式的影响。
    把工农文化技术水平提高到知识分子的水平，这是消灭脑力劳动者和体力劳动者之间本质差别的这个事业的一个极重要的、主要的方面。
    但是，也不能忽略这样一点，即科学技术的进步也迫使知识分子不断提高自己的知识。由于社会主义制度下脑力劳动的特殊条件及复杂性，这类工作者有更高的文化技术水平仍然是必要的。社会主义社会培养一定数量的脑力劳动者，以满足物质生产和精神生产的需要。由于经济的原因，社会在目前发展阶段还不能给自己的所有成员以像知识分子那样的培养。在建成共产主义的过程中，脑力劳动和体力劳动的性质会进一步发生变化，而社会也就可以完成这个任务。
    同时也不能把这个复杂的问题归结为它的一个方面（虽然是极重要的方面），即归结为体力劳动者参加脑力活动。毋庸置疑，这是两方面的过程，它同样也要求知识分子特别是正在成长的一代把脑力劳动同体力劳动和谐地结合起来。共产主义建设实践会提示我们，脑力劳动者将采取什么形式参加有益于社会的体力劳动。但是，共产主义建设实践现在已经证明，把体力劳动和脑力劳动轮换进行的人，工作效率就更高，更有创造性。生产革新者、合理化建议者、发明家以及进行重大社会政治工作的工农积极分子都是如此。
    （摘自苏联“共产党人”杂志1959年第五期阿·库雷列夫：“共产主义建设与消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的本质差别”）
    保卫无产阶级专政的理论
    马克思主义者否认有某种特殊的“中等阶级”存在，但是承认有中间阶层存在，承认这些阶层在政治斗争中的意义和一定作用。这些中间阶层所以不能构成特殊的阶级，首先因为它们在经济上和政治上都各不相同。这些阶层包括各阶级、各社会集团和各社会阶层的代表。在现代条件下，极端重要的是善于确定这些中等阶层各集团将在政治斗争中采取什么立场，因此中间阶层问题实质上就是工人阶级在反对反动势力，反对法西斯威胁和保卫和平斗争中的同盟者的问题。
    但是机会主义理论家们认为重要的是证明另外一件事：他们要证明“中等阶级”正在变成独立的经济力量和政治力量，中等阶级正在吞并无产阶级；这样也就可以从议事日程上取消无产阶级专政问题！为此他们还搬出了整套的论据，证明无产阶级的地位正在“改善”，证明这种“改善”正在使无产阶级变成“中等阶级”。
    改良主义者利用个别国家某一部分工人工资增加的事实，硬说现代资本主义社会里再没有无产阶级贫困化的过程了。同时他们硬说马克思对贫困化有一种非常荒谬的看法，即认为贫困化就是工人阶级物质状况不断地、日甚一日地恶化，而没有任何相反因素的作用。大家知道，马克思主义者早已驳斥了这种庸俗化的对马克思主义贫困化理论的观点。列宁指出，除了贫困化的趋势以外，马克思还提出另一个和这相反的趋势——劳动群众为了提高生活水平而进行的实际斗争。只有在不存在这种斗争的情况下，贫困化的趋势才是无产阶级状况真正不断的恶化。
    现代机会主义者喜欢说，阶级斗争的现象在落后国家里还能看得到，而在发达国家里早就消灭了。
    这完全是捏造事实。工人阶级罢工运动的规模是资本主义大国中阶级斗争尖锐化的重要标志。统计数字表明，恰恰是在那些被机会主义者捧为“阶级调和”的典范的国家里，罢工人数是增加了，而不是减少了。而且问题不仅在于罢工的数量。问题还在于工人所提出的要求的性质，在于其他居民阶层参加罢工斗争的程度。
    无产阶级的革命阶级斗争迫使资产阶级国家作了种种让步：无产阶级在阶级斗争过程中争得了自己的物质状况的某些改善，有时甚至对这个或那个资产阶级政府的政治路线发生一定的影响。无产阶级所领导的保卫和平的斗争是制止帝国主义侵略势力的最重要的因素。
    但是，如果以为工人阶级在资本主义社会里已经取得这样一种地位，以致能够对国家全部政策发生决定性影响，那么这种想法是错误的和有害的。这种观点会歪曲资本主义社会内部的实际关系，会使人产生一种脱离阶级斗争实际任务的幻想。南斯拉夫修正主义者在说明无产阶级影响不断增长这一论点的时候，就认为无产阶级已经变成决定资产阶级国家政策的因素，因而就不需要为无产阶级专政进行斗争了。
