Visiting a Special Store
By our reporters Ye Shitao and Zhou Yongkang

One morning, a middle-aged customer carrying a large abacus hurried into the Shanghai Yimiao District Department Store Repair Service Station. He told repairman Xu Yuyu that the abacus was used for teaching in a primary school, and it had been broken for a long time. He had recently heard about the establishment of this service station, so he specifically brought it in for repair. Xu Yuyu took the abacus and saw that many beads were missing, and the frame and wooden rods were loose. He immediately promised to find a way to fix it. Subsequently, Xu Yuyu went out to find replacement beads. Unfortunately, the abacus factory no longer made this kind of large abacus. If he commissioned a woodworking shop to make them, each bead would cost 15 cents, which was not cost-effective. He ran around to many places and finally found twenty beads in the inventory of a cultural supplies wholesale store. In this way, it only cost 1.20 yuan to repair, and the customer thanked him repeatedly.

Similar things happen frequently at the service station. This special store, the first of its kind in Shanghai, has become well-known since it opened nearly two months ago, and people call it the "Commodity Hospital."

Walking into the service station, you can see the walls are covered with pairs of worn-out rubber shoes marked with numbers in chalk, and in the corners are piles of broken umbrellas, leaky kettles, and shattered thermos bottles... Some repairmen are enthusiastically receiving customers at the counter, while others are burying their heads in dismantling, assembling, hammering, and knocking away intently. Now, this station handles one to two hundred broken items awaiting repair every day. For some simple repairs, such as zippers that have come undone or thermos bottles missing a gasket, customers can have them fixed and take them back on the spot in just a few minutes.

These repairmen were originally salespersons in the Yimiao District department stores and thermos bottle stores. In the past, none of them had learned the repair trade. Now, they have all become experts in repairing general merchandise. If you talk to them about this work, everyone will tell you vividly that repairing and patching, mending and fixing, may seem like small things, but they are closely related to people's lives. Obviously, they have fallen in love with this job.

Repairman Gu Rurong, who used to work as a salesperson at the Xiongdi Thermos Bottle Store, often replaced thermos bottle bamboo shells for customers. In fact, many of the old bamboo shells that were replaced were not seriously damaged. If they could be repaired, they would still be usable. However, since there was no place to repair them, customers had to spend more money to buy new shells. Gu Rurong always thought: If only there were a place to repair bamboo shells! Despite this thought, he was still a little reluctant when the leadership transferred him to work at the service station, thinking that doing repairs and patching would not amount to much. Later, every time a customer happily took back a repaired thermos bottle after spending only ten or twenty cents, Gu Rurong felt a sense of joy and honor in his heart.

The sense of honor in the work has also strengthened the sense of responsibility for the work. They have a common aspiration: anything that customers bring in that is broken, if they can fix it, they must fix it; if they can't fix it, they must try to learn how to fix it slowly. Although the service station's door indicates that the repair scope is only more than twenty kinds of general merchandise such as rubber shoes, zippers, and umbrellas, customers often send in items that are beyond their expectations. When encountering this situation, the repairmen still take it on and try every means to repair it.

One evening, a customer brought in a surveying instrument used in construction engineering. Because a small spring was broken, the instrument could no longer be used. The repairmen heard that the customer had been running around all afternoon to repair this instrument, and it was needed early the next morning. So, they "consulted" together overnight, studying and repairing it at the same time, and finally fixed it.

The busiest service at the service station is repairing broken rubber shoes. The three repairmen can only repair a maximum of forty pairs a day, while the rubber shoes sent in are often sixty or seventy pairs, and sometimes more than one hundred pairs. How to repair quickly and well? This is a question that customers are concerned about. They first focused on this and designed a simple automatic sole grinding machine. To patch rubber shoes, you must first file the area around the hole and the split edge clean before applying glue. In the past, to replace the front sole and heel, you had to file it one stroke at a time with a file. Now, as long as you press the rubber shoe against the roller of the machine, it can be ground flat in just a few minutes.

The repairmen wholeheartedly and diligently serve the consumers, and have received universal praise. The suggestion book hanging at the entrance of the service station is densely filled with words of praise. These compliments are both encouragement and impetus for them. Now, the repairmen are preparing to adopt methods such as going deep into the neighborhoods and collecting items door-to-door, to bring more convenience to the masses.

The employees of the Shanghai Yimiao District Department Store Repair Service Station try every means to facilitate customers, and try to repair items with minor "problems" as soon as they arrive. If the bamboo shell of a thermos bottle is broken, they will replace it with a new one. If a toothbrush is broken, you can bring the toothbrush handle and have a new brush head replaced. After waiting for a while, it can be replaced.

When sent in, it was tattered and worn, when taken away, it was repaired and renewed. When the customer took back this umbrella, it was almost impossible to find the original flaws. (Attached picture)

    访特殊商店
    本报记者　叶世涛　周永康
    一天清晨，一位中年顾客挟着一个大算盘，匆匆地走进了上海邑庙区百货修配服务站。他告诉修配员徐玉瑜：这个算盘是一所小学校教课用的，已经坏了很久，最近听说这里设了服务站，特地找来修理。徐玉瑜接过算盘一看，只见上面掉了好多颗珠子，盘架和木档也都松开了。当时他答应一定设法修好。随后，徐玉瑜就出门去配珠子。真不凑巧，算盘工场早就不做这种大算盘了，要是委托车木作场定做，一颗珠子要一角五分，很不合算。他又跑了很多地方，最后才在一个文化用品批发店的存货中找到了二十颗。这样只花了一元二角钱就修好了，顾客高兴得连连道谢。
    类似这样的事情，在服务站经常会碰到。这家上海首创的特殊商店，开设近两个月来，声名远扬，人们都把它称作“商品医院”。
    走进服务站，可以看到墙上挂满了一双双用粉笔标着号码的破胶鞋，墙角里堆着断骨的雨伞、漏底的水壶、破壳的热水瓶……修理员们有的正在柜台边热情地接待顾客，有的埋着头专心地在拆拆装装、敲敲打打。现在，这个站每天承接破旧待修的物件有一、二百件之多。一些简易的小修，像拉链豁开了，热水瓶缺块垫板，顾客们拿到这里，只要等上几分钟，就可以当场修好带回去。
    这些修配员原来都是邑庙区百货、热水瓶商店的售货员，过去谁也没有学过修配这一行。现在，都变成了修理百货的能手。如果你同他们谈起这项工作的时候，每个人都会有声有色地告诉你，修修配配、缝缝补补，看来是件小事情，但是和人们的生活有着密切的关系。显然，他们已经爱上了这门工作。
    修配员顾儒荣以前在兄弟热水瓶商店当营业员的时候，经常给顾客配换热水瓶竹壳。其实很多换下来的旧竹壳，毛病不是顶大的，如果修理一下仍然可用，由于找不到地方修理，顾客不得不花费更多的钱去配新壳。顾儒荣一直这样想：要是能有个修竹壳的地方该多好呀！尽管这样想，当领导上调他到服务站来工作的时候，他仍然有点勉强，认为搞修修配配终究出息不大。后来，每到顾客花了一两角钱，高高兴兴地拿回修好的热水瓶的时候，顾儒荣内心就产生一种喜悦和光荣感。
    工作的光荣感也加强了对工作的责任感。他们怀着一个共同的心愿：顾客拿来的破东西，会修的一定要修好它；不会修也要揣摸着慢慢地学着修。服务站的门口，虽然标明修配范围不过是胶鞋、拉链、雨伞等二十多种百货用品，其实，常常有些顾客送来出乎他们意料的物件。碰到这种情况，修配员照样接下来，千方百计设法修理。
    一天傍晚，有个顾客送来了一架建筑工程上用的测量仪器，因为坏了一个小弹簧，仪器不能再用。修配员听说顾客为了修理这个仪器，已经跑了整整一个下午，而明天一早又等着要用。于是，他们就连夜“会诊”，几个人一边研究、一边修理，终于把它修好了。
    服务站业务最忙的是修理破胶鞋，三个修配员每天最多只能修四十双，而送来的胶鞋却经常有六、七十双，多的时候超过一百双。怎样修得又快又好？这是顾客关心的问题。他们首先在这上面打主意，设计了一架简易的自动磨底机。补胶鞋一定要先把洞眼裂边四周锉干净才能上胶。过去换副前底后跟，用锉刀一刀刀地锉，现在只要把胶鞋朝机器的滚筒上一按，不消几分钟就磨得平平整整。
    修配员们一心一意、勤勤恳恳为消费者服务，得到了普遍的赞扬。服务站门口挂着的意见簿上，密密麻麻地写满了表扬的语句。这些称赞，对他们来说，是鼓励又是鞭策。现在，修配员们正准备采取深入里弄、上门收件等办法，把更多的方便带给群众。
    上海邑庙区百货修配服务站的职工想一切办法便利顾客，遇到“毛病”不大的东西尽可能做到随到随修。热水瓶竹壳坏了，就给换个新的。牙刷坏了，可以把牙刷把拿来换上新毛，稍等一会，就可以换好。
    送来的时候破旧不堪，拿去的时候修整一新。顾客在取回这顶雨伞的时候，简直找不到原先的破绽在那里。（附图片）
