Chengdu, June 3rd (report from our newspaper) – After a period of intense labor, seventeen million farmers in Sichuan Province have completed the emergency harvest of over twenty million mu of wheat.

The harvested wheat is being threshed across the province, and reports of abundant harvests are pouring in. In Xichang Prefecture, where the season starts earlier, the average yield of over 50,000 mu of the 420,000 mu of wheat after threshing is 426 jin per mu, an increase of one and a half times compared to last year. The Chengdu Plain, known as the granary, has seen widespread yield increases. The CPC Wenjiang Prefectural Committee inspection team harvested and threshed 1,069 mu of wheat of upper, middle and lower grades in sixteen counties throughout the region, and the average yield per mu far exceeded that of last year. The Fifth Team of the Xinong People's Commune in Xinfan County harvested 5.4 mu of wheat, and after drying and winnowing, the average yield per mu was 627 jin, an increase of 80%. The five mu of wheat harvested by the nearby Liji Commune yielded an average of 757 jin per mu, doubling the yield of last year. The 21 mu of wheat in the Shanwangmiao Farming Area of the Guihu Commune in Xindu County yielded an average of 608.5 jin of dry wheat per mu. In the hilly and mountainous areas of northern and central Sichuan, although wheat encountered drought this year, the yield still exceeded any previous year. The 51,692 mu already threshed in Lezhi County yielded an average of 488 jin per mu. In Xichong County, which is famous for its high sweet potato production, wheat is also better than in previous years, which lays the foundation for increasing the proportion of fine grains this year. Mabian County, with its rolling hills, achieved large-scale high yields, with an average yield of 451.2 jin per mu on 16,200 mu of wheat.

In view of the heavy workload and tight schedule of this year's wheat harvest, Party committees at all levels strengthened labor organization and arrangements from the outset. From the provincial Party secretary to grassroots cadres, all personally participated in the emergency harvest and threshing at the forefront of the summer harvest, directing the overall effort. In order to ensure sufficient forces on the main offensive line, various localities repeatedly reduced the labor force in other aspects of the countryside to ensure that 85% of the strength was used on the production front. A large number of government cadres, university and middle school students, troops, and urban residents went to the countryside to support the harvest. People's communes in various places generally established emergency harvesting and threshing combat teams, adopting methods of assigning people, quantity, quality, time, and land plots to implement the tasks of harvesting, transporting, threshing, storing, and managing to specific individuals, which greatly improved work efficiency and accelerated the progress of harvesting and threshing. Jiang'an County encountered continuous rainy weather during the emergency harvest, which brought many difficulties to the harvest, but because the county fully mobilized the masses and the organizational work was meticulous, the county's harvesting work was completed in a five-day blitz. The county also flexibly arranged labor according to different weather conditions, achieving both sunny and rainy harvesting, day and night harvesting, and sunny drying and rainy kang-threshing, so that harvesting and threshing work did not stop due to rainy weather.

In order to achieve a full harvest and ensure that all grains are collected and stored, the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee issued an "Emergency Notice on Avoiding Scattering and Mold During the Spring Harvest" based on the harvest situation, emphasizing that Party secretaries at all levels and all rural work cadres should participate in harvesting, threshing, and turning over to set an example, convene on-site meetings, and use the method of detailed accounting to educate commune and team cadres and members, so that they cherish the fruits of their labor and ensure that every ear is harvested and every grain is stored in the granary.

    穗穗收净　粒粒归仓
    四川小麦收割完毕
    本报成都3日电　四川省一千七百万农民经过一段紧张的劳动，二千多万亩小麦，已全部抢收完毕。
    各地割倒的小麦正在脱粒，丰收的捷报陆续传出。季节较早的西昌专区四十二万亩小麦，其中经过脱粒的五万多亩平均亩产四百二十六斤，比去年增产一倍半。号称粮仓的川西平原，普遍增产。中共温江地委检查团在全区十六个县收打了一千零六十九亩上中下三种类型的小麦，每亩平均产量都远远超过去年。新繁县新农公社第五队收了五亩四分小麦，晒干风净后，平均亩产六百二十七斤，增产80％。附近的利济公社收打的五亩小麦，平均亩产达到七百五十七斤，比去年翻了一番。新都县桂湖公社山王庙耕作区的二十一亩小麦，平均每亩实收干麦六百零八斤半。在川北和川中丘陵、山地，虽然今年小麦遇到干旱，但产量仍超过以往任何一年。乐至县已经脱粒的五万一千六百九十二亩，平均亩产四百八十八斤。在以甘薯高产闻名的西充县，小麦也比往年都好，这为今年增加细粮比重奠定了基础。山蛮起伏的马边县得到大面积高产，一万六千二百亩小麦平均亩产四百五十一点二斤。
    根据今年麦收工作量大，时间紧迫的特点，各级党委一开始就加强了劳动组织安排。从省委书记到基层干部，都亲自到夏收最前线参加抢收抢打，指挥全面。为了保证主攻战线有足够兵力，各地一再压缩了农村中其他方面的劳动力，保证85％的力量用在生产战线上。大批机关干部，大中学校学生、部队和城镇居民等，都纷纷下乡支援。各地人民公社普遍建立了抢收抢打战斗小组，采取定人、定量、定质、定时、定地块办法，把收割、运输、脱粒、入仓、保管等任务，具体落实到人，大大提高了工效，加快了收打进度。江安县在抢收中遇到连绵阴雨，给收割带来许多困难，但由于全县发动群众充分、组织工作细致，全县收割工作在五天内突击完成。这个县还按照不同的天气，机动灵活安排劳动力，作到晴雨兼收、日收夜打、晴晒雨炕、收打工作不因阴雨而停顿。
    为了作到丰产全收，脱粒归仓，中共四川省委曾根据收割情况发出“关于小春收获中避免抛撒霉烂的紧急通知”，强调各级党委书记和所有农村工作干部，都应参加收割、脱粒和翻打，做出样子，召开现场会议，用算细账的办法，对社队干部和社员等进行教育，使他们珍惜劳动成果，保证穗穗收净，粒粒归仓。
