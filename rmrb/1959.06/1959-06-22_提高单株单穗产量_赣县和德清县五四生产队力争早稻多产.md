Increasing per-plant and per-panicle yield
    Ganxian and Deqing County's Fifth Fourth Production Team Strive for Higher Early Rice Yields

    (Our newspaper, Ganzhou, 21st) Most of the 400,000 mu of early rice in Ganxian, Jiangxi, has already headed and flowered. The people of the entire county are seizing the late-stage field management to increase the yield per plant and per panicle, striving to increase the yield of each mu by 40 jin of rice on the basis of the original plan.

    Each commune in the county has generally conducted an inspection of the rice seedlings, and formulated different management measures according to the classification of fields. For example, those lacking fertilizer mainly focus on topdressing, those with pests mainly focus on pest control, and those prone to lodging focus on preventing lodging.

    This year, due to sufficient base fertilizer and dense planting in the early rice fields of Ganxian County, the rice seedlings are growing vigorously. Some rice seedlings have thin and weak stems and are prone to excessive growth, with a tendency to lodge. Therefore, preventing lodging is the most prominent task in late-stage field management. Various measures have been taken in various places to prevent lodging.

    Party committees at all levels throughout the county have strengthened their leadership over late-stage field management, and the main cadres from the county to the production team have gone deep into the fields to participate in management work together with the masses. (Liu Guanghui)

    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 21st) The Fifth Fourth Production Team of Sanqiao Commune in Deqing County, Zhejiang, has strengthened early rice field management and launched a campaign to strive for an additional hundred jin of grain.

    The Fifth Fourth Production Team planted 692 mu of early rice this year, and the rice seedlings have begun to round their stems and joint, and are generally growing very well.

    Although the rice is growing well, the members of the Fifth Fourth Production Team are not satisfied. Many farmers have actively put forward the content and requirements for strengthening management. Local farmers say, "Stirring muddy water can increase the yield by five dou of grain"; "If the dung ladle moves to the rice bucket, there are still three dou of rice to grow." This means that as long as weeding and topdressing are strengthened, the early rice yield can be increased. Therefore, they put forward the slogan of "strengthening early rice field management and increasing the yield by one hundred jin of grain per mu."

    Due to the good ideological mobilization work, sufficient preparations, and proper labor arrangements, from June 6th to 9th, in four days, all the early rice fields were weeded and grassed again on the basis of having been weeded and tilled three times. At the same time, they applied human and animal manure or ash fertilizer to all the rice fields, averaging more than 14 dan per mu. Then, they generally carried out drying the fields to allow the rice roots to take root deeply, the rice stalks to be strong, and the grains to be full. (Chen Lian)

    提高单株单穗产量
    赣县和德清县五四生产队力争早稻多产
    本报赣州21日电 江西赣县四十万亩早稻大部分已经抽穗扬花，全县人民正在抓紧后期田间管理，提高单株单穗产量，争取每亩田在原计划基础上增收四十斤稻谷。
    全县各公社普遍对禾苗进行了一次检查，分类分田制定了不同的管理措施。例如缺肥的以追肥为主，有虫害的以防虫为主，要倒伏的着重防止倒伏。
    今年赣县早稻田由于底肥足和插得密，禾苗生长旺盛，部分禾苗茎秆细弱发生徒长现象，有倒伏的趋势。因此，防止倒伏是后期田间管理中最突出的一项工作。各地采取了各种防止倒伏的措施。
    全县各级党委都加强了对后期田间管理工作的领导，从县到生产队的主要干部都深入到田间，和群众一起参加管理工作。　（刘光辉）
    本报杭州21日电　浙江德清县三乔公社五四生产队，加强早稻田间管理，开展了争取多收百斤谷运动。
    五四生产队今年种了六百九十二亩早稻，稻苗已开始圆秆拔节，生长普遍很好。
    稻谷虽然长得好，但五四生产队的社员并不满足，许多农民积极地提出了加强管理的内容和要求。当地的农谚说：“浑水摸一摸，便可多收五斗谷”；“粪杓动到稻桶响，还有三斗米好长”。这就是说只要加强耘耥和追肥，就可以使早稻增产。于是他们提出了“加强早稻田间管理，每亩多收一百斤谷”的口号。
    由于思想动员工作做得好，准备充分，劳力安排得宜，从6月6日到9日的四天中，全部早稻田在已经耘耥了三次的基础上，又进行了一次耘耥和拔草。与此同时，他们又将全部稻田多施了一遍人畜粪肥或灰肥，每亩平均施了十四担以上。接着又普遍进行了搁田，以便稻根深扎，稻秆粗壮，谷粒饱满。　（陈廉）
