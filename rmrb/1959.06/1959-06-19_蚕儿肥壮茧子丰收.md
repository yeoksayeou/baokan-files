Zhejiang New Cocoons Hit the Market, Hubei Begins Purchasing

(Report) Zhejiang Province's spring cocoon season is in full swing, with a promising harvest. New cocoons have already entered the market, and purchasing departments have begun buying.

This year, many high-yield records have emerged in Zhejiang. In the Lianmeng Production Team of Xucun Commune in Haining County, over 24 silkworm sheets averaged 84.63 jin of cocoons per sheet. In the Shuibei Production Team of the Shilin Brigade in Xinshi Commune, Deqing County, the collective rearing room of the Lu family had one silkworm sheet that produced as much as 164 jin of cocoons. These newly harvested cocoons are generally of good quality, with a clean white color, normal luster, and uniform size and shape. One jin generally contains about 220 cocoons, with the fewest being 153 cocoons per jin.

Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, Zhejiang Province's silkworm production began preparations last winter and spring, centered on increasing mulberry leaf production and silkworm rearing. Mulberry trees throughout the province underwent soil turning and fertilization, pruning and layering, frost prevention and bud protection, and pest and disease control measures. As a result, mulberry trees had a high germination rate this year. Various localities also repaired and renovated silkworm rooms and tools, and prepared sufficient disinfectant medicines. Linghu Commune in Wuxing built more than 200 silkworm rooms and over 30,000 silkworm trays. Originally, they planned to raise 36,000 silkworm sheets in the spring, but they ended up raising 42,000 sheets, exceeding the plan.

To ensure a bountiful cocoon harvest, a technical innovation movement was launched throughout the province. Since the beginning of this year, various localities have created and promoted more than 50 advanced experiences. During silkworm rearing, in addition to generally implementing advanced methods such as multiple small feedings, feeding with high-quality mulberry leaves to satiation, and spacious silkworm beds, they also used penicillin, baking soda, soybean milk, and various sugars for nutritional supplements. At the same time, the policy of "prevention first" and "combining prevention and treatment" for silkworm diseases was strictly implemented. On the one hand, the work of disinfecting silkworm rooms and tools was emphasized; on the other hand, bleaching powder and Xilisheng were often used to disinfect silkworms, thus greatly reducing the incidence of silkworm diseases.

More than 2,000 employees were transferred from silk reeling factories throughout the province to directly participate in silkworm production in rural communal rearing rooms, playing a role in ensuring this year's spring cocoon harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 17th: Commercial departments in various parts of Hubei have begun purchasing spring cocoons and have acquired nearly 8,000 dan (a unit of weight).

Spring silkworms in Hubei Province grew well this year, with the cocoons being white in color and uniform in shape. Generally, there are more than 250 cocoons per jin, and the cocoon shell ratio (the percentage of the cocoon shell layer to the entire cocoon layer) reached 18%. A batch of spring cocoons harvested in Dongchongfan, Luotian County, had a cocoon shell ratio as high as 23.69%, which is unprecedented in Hubei Province.

Hubei Province has a mild climate and is very suitable for silkworm rearing. The number of improved silkworm sheets distributed by government departments this spring increased by 12% compared to the same period last year. More than 90% of the counties in the province are generally raising silkworms. (Attached pictures)

    蚕儿肥壮茧子丰收
    浙江新茧上市  湖北开秤收购
    本报讯　浙江省春茧进入旺收季节，丰收有望。现在新茧已经上市，采购部门正在开秤收购。
    今年，浙江各地出现了不少高产纪录，海宁县许村公社联盟生产队的二十四张多蚕种，平均每张产茧八十四点六三斤；德清县新市公社士林大队水北生产队陆家里共育室有一张蚕种，产茧高达一百六十四斤多。这些新收的茧子，茧质普遍良好，茧色洁白，光泽正常，茧形大小齐一，一市斤一般在二百二十粒左右，最少的每斤茧子只有一百五十三粒。
    浙江省蚕桑生产，在各级党组织的领导下，早在去冬今春就开展了以增产桑叶为中心的桑园管理和养蚕准备工作。全省桑树普遍进行了翻土施肥、整枝伏条、防冻保芽、防治病虫害等措施，因此，今年桑树发芽率高。各地对蚕室、蚕具也进行了修建整理，消毒的蚕药也准备充足。吴兴菱湖公社造蚕室二百多间，蚕匾三万多只，原计划养春蚕三万六千张，结果养了四万二千张，超过了计划。
    为了确保蚕茧丰收，全省开展了技术革新运动，今年以来，各地创造与推广了先进经验五十多项。在养蚕过程中，各地除普遍贯彻多回薄饲、良桑饱食、宽舒蚕座等先进办法以外，还用青霉素、小苏打、豆浆以及各种糖类大搞营养添食。同时严格贯彻“以防为主”和“防治兼施”的防治蚕病方针，一面抓住蚕室、蚕具消毒工作；一面经常用漂白粉、西力生等进行蚕体消毒，因此，蚕儿发病现象大大减少。
    全省缫丝厂抽调了两千多名职工，到农村共育室直接参与蚕桑生产，在保证今年春茧丰收工作中发挥了作用。

    据新华社武汉17日电　湖北各地商业部门开秤收购春茧，已收购近八千担。
    湖北省今年春蚕生长良好，茧粒色泽洁白，颗形均匀，一般每斤茧有二百五十多颗，茧层率（茧壳层量占整个茧子层量的百分比）达到18％。罗田县东冲畈收获的一批春茧，茧层率高达23.69％，这是湖北省过去从来没有过的。
    湖北省气候温和，很适宜于养蚕，政府部门今年春季发放的改良蚕种张数比去年同期增加12％。全省有90％以上的县份普遍喂养桑蚕。（附图片）
