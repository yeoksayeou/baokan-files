Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 4th. (By our correspondent Zhou Zuyou) After democratic reform, Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province has fundamentally eliminated the class roots that caused national oppression and national division, and socialist ethnic relations are developing day by day. The Tibetan, Qiang, Hui, Han and other ethnic groups living here are now united and cooperating with each other to jointly build a better hometown.

The new ethnic relations are primarily manifested in the boundless love and trust of the people of all ethnic minorities for the Communist Party and the People's Government. They actively responded to the call, and the entire prefecture achieved advanced collectivization within two years after the democratic reform. Many Tibetan people even voluntarily consulted with Han work cadres on personal life matters and had heart-to-heart talks. When an old Tibetan woman from the Suochengmei tribe in the grassland saw off a Han cadre, she shed tears and was reluctant to part, saying: "The feudal lords used to say that the People's Government is the government of the Han people, but I say that the People's Government is the savior of the Tibetan people. I will follow the Communist Party to the death!"

Mutual assistance and cooperation, and learning from each other, are the characteristics of the current friendly relations between the people of all ethnic groups. They jointly destroyed the feudal system in the democratic reform, and jointly formed agricultural cooperatives and people's communes. Now, along the Minjiang River, the Heishui River, and the Zagu Nao River, there are joint cooperatives composed of multiple ethnic groups everywhere. Many villages and tribes that never interacted with each other in the past have also formed close ties. Juan'er Township in Daikin County is inhabited by Tibetan, Hui, and Han farmers. Before liberation, due to the instigation of the feudal lords of the three ethnic groups, conflicts often occurred between the ethnic groups. Once, the Hui and Han landlords fought for women, and forced the farmers of the three ethnic groups to fight for them, resulting in many casualties. In the democratic reform, the Tibetan, Hui, and Han farmers jointly overthrew the feudal rule. They said: The roots of disunity between ethnic groups have now been dug up! Last year, farmers from the three ethnic groups jointly established a people's commune, and production teams and groups often provided mutual support in terms of labor, seeds, and fertilizer. Nongjiale Agricultural Cooperative in Maowen Qiang Autonomous County is composed of members of the Tibetan, Han, Qiang, and Hui ethnic groups. In the past, farmers of all ethnic groups did not even exchange labor with each other. After the establishment of the cooperative, they worked together and learned production techniques from each other. Everyone's enthusiasm for production was very high. In just one year, the income of this cooperative exceeded the level of local wealthy middle peasants, with a per-mu grain yield of more than 730 jin. In addition, farmers of all ethnic groups in the entire prefecture have also extensively carried out large-scale cooperation in various production campaigns, borrowing fertilizer and seeds from each other, jointly building water conservancy projects, and exchanging production experience. Songs praising ethnic unity are widely circulated throughout the autonomous prefecture. People sing: There are many high mountain peaks, but the mountain roots are connected as one; there are many large and small rivers, but they flow into the sea as one; there are many fraternal ethnic groups, but the hearts that love the motherland are one.

After the democratic reform, not only has the relationship between the various ethnic groups undergone fundamental changes, but the unity within the ethnic groups has also been strengthened. For example, the Regezhai and Lilazhai Tibetan villages in Ruoergai County often had armed fights in the past due to feudal lords fighting for power and profit. After the democratic reform, the Tibetan people of the two villages raised their awareness. Jia Wang, a cadre from Regezhai, proactively said to a cadre from Lilazhai: Our armed fights were caused by the feudal lords. Now the Communist Party has led us to remove the big stones on our heads, and we should no longer hate each other. The cadres of the two villages presented hadas to each other, and the masses cheered long live the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now, these two villages have formed a cooperative and are united together to develop production.

### 民主改革后共同建设美好的家乡  阿坝各族人民团结互助

    民主改革后共同建设美好的家乡
    阿坝各族人民团结互助
    新华社成都4日电  本社记者周祖佑报道：四川省阿坝藏族自治州经过民主改革，从根本上消灭了造成民族压迫和民族隔阂的阶级根源，社会主义的民族关系日益发展。居住在这里的藏、羌、回、汉等各族人民目前正团结无间，互助协作，共同建设着美好的家乡。
    新的民族关系，首先表现为各少数民族人民对共产党和人民政府的无限热爱和信赖。他们积极响应号召，全州在民主改革后两年多的时间内，就实现了高级合作化。许多藏族人民连个人的生活私事，也主动地去找汉族工作干部商量，谈知心话。草地索称美部落一位藏族老大娘送别汉族干部时，流着眼泪依依不舍，她说：“封建主过去说人民政府是汉人政府，我说人民政府是藏民的救命恩人。我至死也要跟着共产党走！”
    互助协作、彼此学习，是当前各族人民友好关系的特点。他们在民主改革中共同摧毁了封建制度，又共同组成了农业合作社和人民公社。现在，在岷江、黑水和杂谷脑河沿岸，到处都是多民族组成的联合社。许多老死不相往来的村寨和部落，也结成了亲密的联系。大金县涓尔乡居住着藏、回、汉三族农民，解放前由于三族封建主挑拨，民族之间经常发生冲突。有一次，回、汉两族大地主争夺女人，还强迫三族农民为他们打仗，死伤了许多人。民主改革中，藏、回、汉族农民共同推翻了封建统治。他们说：民族间不团结的根根这下挖掉了！去年，三族农民共同建立了人民公社，生产队、组之间经常在劳力、种籽、肥料等方面互相支援。茂汶羌族自治县农家乐农业社是由藏、汉、羌、回四族社员组成的。过去，各族农民连换工也不在一起。建社后，他们一起劳动，互相学习生产技术，大家生产积极性很高，只有一年功夫，这个社的收入就超过了当地富裕中农的水平，亩产粮食七百三十多斤。此外，全州各族农民在各项生产运动中，还广泛开展了大协作，互相借肥借种，共同兴修水利，交流生产经验。自治州到处流传着歌颂民族团结的歌曲。人们唱道：高高的山顶有许多，山根相连是一个；大小江河有许多，流入大海是一个；兄弟民族有许多，热爱祖国的心是一个。
    民主改革以后，不仅各民族之间的关系起了根本变化，民族内部的团结也加强了。如若尔盖县热哥寨和里拉寨两个藏族寨子，过去由于封建主争权夺利，经常发生械斗。民主改革后，两寨藏民提高了觉悟。热哥寨干部呷望主动地向里拉寨干部说：我们的械斗是封建主造成的，现在共产党领导我们掀掉了压在我们头上的大石头，我们再不应该彼此仇杀了。两寨的干部互献哈达，群众欢呼共产党和毛主席万岁。现在，这两个寨子已经组成了一个合作社，团结在一起发展生产。
