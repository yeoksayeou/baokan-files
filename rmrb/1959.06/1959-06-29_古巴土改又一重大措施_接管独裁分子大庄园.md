　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 27th. Following the requisition of large estates in Camagüey Province belonging to American monopoly capital, the Cuban government recently took over ninety estates in Havana Province belonging to senior officials of the Batista regime.

　　These ninety estates were seized over many years by Batista and his loyal henchmen, General Miranda, the head of the "Tiger Squad," former Senator Masferrer, former police Colonel Ventura, and labor traitor Mujal, through bloody means. Mujal's estate was worth millions of pesos. Another estate owner, Cajigas, owned several estates covering a total of two thousand caballerias, with more than a thousand head of cattle.

    古巴土改又一重大措施
    接管独裁分子大庄园
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　继征收了卡马圭省内属于美国垄断资本的大庄园土地后，古巴政府最近又接管了巴蒂斯塔政权高级官员在哈瓦那省的九十个庄园。
    这九十个庄园是巴蒂斯塔和他的忠实走狗米兰达将军、“老虎队”头子前参议员马斯费雷尔、前警察上校本图拉、工贼头目穆哈尔等多年来用血腥的手段掠夺得来的。穆哈尔的庄园价值达数百万比索，另一庄园主卡希加斯拥有的几个庄园占地共达两千卡瓦耶里亚，有牛一千余头。
