    Constantly Strengthen the Combat Effectiveness of Party Organizations
    The Jiangshan Production Team Party Branch Enriches Organizational Life and Improves Party Members' Awareness
    (Our newspaper reports) The Jiangshan Production Team Party Branch of Yonglin Commune in Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province, continuously enriches its organizational life, effectively improving the communist awareness of Party members and giving play to the role of the grassroots Party organization as a fighting fortress and the exemplary role of Party members.
    Since the Party rectification in 1953, this branch has held organizational life meetings every month on the 2nd and 16th, without interruption. At the organizational life meetings, many Party members truly achieve that there is nothing that cannot be said to the organization. They regard participating in organizational life as an indispensable part of their daily life, as some Party members said: "We are so used to having organizational life twice a month that we start thinking about it early before the 2nd and 16th arrive." Some Party members describe participating in organizational life meetings as feeling "more intimate and joyful than a child lying in the arms of a loving mother."
    Organizational life meetings are not only deeply rooted in the minds of Party members, but the masses also know that the 2nd and 16th are "Organization Days." They actively reflect their opinions to Party members and request that they be brought to the organizational meetings for resolution.
    After the Party branch strictly enforced the Party's organizational life, the ideological awareness of Party members has been significantly improved. Many Party members in their daily work and life, constantly pay attention to measuring themselves with the standards of a Party member, and exemplarily lead the masses to implement the Party's various guidelines and policies. Therefore, for the past seven years, the Jiangshan Production Team has not only completed its various production tasks very well, but also whenever the state needs materials, they always adhere to the principle of small collectives submitting to large collectives, and lead the masses to voluntarily sell them to the state. In recent years, they have voluntarily sold native and special products worth more than 3,000 yuan to the state. Because their tasks are completed well, they have been praised by higher authorities many times. Since the Great Leap Forward last year alone, they have successively won nine large red flags from the county, commune, and management district, and the provincial agricultural inspection team awarded them the glorious title of "Ten-Good Production Team."
    The Jiangshan Party Branch's adherence to the Party's organizational life has not been smooth sailing. Before 1953, organizational life was often "three days of fishing, two days of drying nets." After the establishment of the organizational life system in 1953, many Party members felt unaccustomed to it. At this time, the branch first strengthened the education of Party members on organization and discipline, enhanced organizational awareness, and improved consciousness. It called on every Party member to earnestly study the basic knowledge of the Party and learn "How to Be a Good Communist." At that time, the fourteen Party members of this branch each bought a copy of "How to Be a Good Communist." After studying, each Party member realized ideologically that participating in the Party's organizational life is one of the basic conditions for a Party member. At the same time, the branch promptly criticized Party members who did not participate in organizational life without reason, and even conducted necessary ideological struggle. For example, Party member Ye Xiulong often did not participate in organizational life at the beginning. After criticism and education, he came to participate every time. After these methods, the Party's organizational life became the urgent requirement and conscious action of every Party member. Party member Chen Shisheng said that not coming to the organizational meeting on the 2nd and 16th is like not having eaten.
    In addition to strengthening education on organization and discipline, organizational life must have a strong ideological and combat nature, which is one of the most important keys for this branch to adhere to and consolidate organizational life. The content of their organizational life, in addition to studying documents, studying work, discussing the admission of new Party members and handling problems among Party members, also has a very important content, that is, inner-Party heart-to-heart talks and conducting criticism and self-criticism. In heart-to-heart talks and conducting criticism and self-criticism, emphasis is placed on promoting democracy, so that different opinions within the Party can be fully exposed, and organizational life is regarded as a platform for Party members to speak. Therefore, in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, they truly achieved ideological exchanges and mutual assistance, thereby eliminating estrangement among Party members and strengthening unity.
    "Does work in mountainous areas have a future after all?" This question was not well resolved in the minds of some Party members. The Party branch raised the questions in the organizational life meeting: "Does the mountainous area have a future after all?" "Is it right not to want to work in mountainous areas?" "How should Communist Party members do a good job in production?" etc., and asked everyone to use the "standard ruler" (they call the Party member standard the "standard ruler") to compare themselves. Through discussion, the education of Party members was greatly enhanced. They consciously criticized the erroneous idea of ​​despising work in mountainous areas and established confidence in work in mountainous areas.
    In addition to regularly conducting criticism and self-criticism to strengthen the ideological and combat nature of organizational life, they pay special attention to unifying their thinking within the Party on many major issues or in the face of difficulties, so as to ensure better completion of tasks. In the situation where labor was tight and production tasks urgently required labor, the branch repeatedly discussed through organizational life, calling on every Party member to show the courage to overcome difficulties and complete tasks. The enthusiasm of Party members was greatly improved, and they took the lead in driving the masses to work hard and skillfully, not only completing the tasks on time, but also drawing twenty-eight laborers to support neighboring villages in sowing wheat for three days.

    不断加强党组织的战斗力
    将山生产队党支部充实组织生活提高党员觉悟
    本报讯　浙江省永嘉县永临公社将山生产队党支部，不断充实组织生活，有效地提高了党员的共产主义觉悟，发挥了基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的带头作用。
    这个支部从1953年整党以来，每月逢到初二和十六过组织生活，一次也没有间断过。在组织生活会议上，许多党员真正做到无事不可对组织言。他们把过组织生活看成日常生活中不可缺少的一部分，正如有的党员说：一个月两次组织生活过惯了，还没有到初二，十六，早早就想起来了。有些党员形容参加组织生活会议“比孩子躺在慈母怀抱里还感到亲切、愉快。”
    组织生活会议不仅在党员思想上扎了根，而且在群众中也知道初二、十六是“组织日”。他们主动地向党员反映意见，要求带到组织会议上去解决。
    这个支部严格了党的组织生活后，党员的思想觉悟已经有了显著提高。许多党员在日常工作上、生活上，时时刻刻注意用党员标准衡量自己，并模范地带领群众贯彻党的各项方针、政策。正因如此，将山生产队七年来，不仅各项生产任务完成得很好，而且只要是国家需要的物资，他们总是以小集体服从大集体的原则，带领群众，自动出售给国家。几年来，他们自动出售给国家的土产特产品价值达三千元以上。因为他们的任务完成得好，历次受到上级表扬。仅去年大跃进以来，就连续获得县、公社、管理区九面大红旗，省农业检查团赠给
  “十好生产队”的光荣称号。
    将山党支部坚持党的组织生活，并不是一帆风顺的。1953年以前，组织生活往往是“三天打鱼，两天晒网”，1953年开始建立组织生活制度以后，曾经有不少党员感到不习惯。这时，支部首先加强对党员组织性和纪律性的教育，增强组织观念，提高自觉性。号召每个党员认真学习党的基本知识，学习“怎样做一个共产党员”。当时，这个支部的十四个党员，每人买了一本“怎样做一个共产党员”，经过学习，每个党员从思想上认识到参加党的组织生活是党员起码条件之一。同时，支部对于无故不过组织生活的党员及时开展了批评，以至必要的思想斗争。如党员叶秀龙开始时，经常不参加组织生活，予以批评教育后，每次都来参加了。通过以上一些办法以后，党的组织生活就变成每个党员的迫切要求和自觉行动。党员陈士生说，初二、十六不来参加组织会议，就像没有吃饭一样。
    除加强组织性、纪律性教育以外，组织生活必须具有强烈的思想性和战斗性，这是这个支部坚持巩固组织生活极其重要的关键之一。他们组织生活的内容，除了学习文件，研究工作，讨论吸收新党员入党和处理党员中的问题以外，还有很重要的一个内容，就是党内互相谈心，开展批评与自我批评。在互相谈心、开展批评与自我批评中，强调发扬民主，使党内不同意见得到充分暴露，把组织生活当作党员讲话的讲台。因此，在开展批评与自我批评当中，真正做到了思想交锋，互相帮助，从而在党员中消除了隔阂，加强了团结。
    “山区工作到底有没有前途”？这个问题在部分党员思想上没有得到很好解决。党支部在组织生活会议上，即提出了：“山区到底有没有前途”？“不愿在山区工作对不对”？“共产党员应如何搞好生产工作”等等问题进行讨论，并要大家用“标准尺”（他们称党员标准为“标准尺”）对照自己，通过讨论，对党员教育很大，自觉批判了轻视山区工作的错误思想，树立了对山区工作的信心。
    加强组织生活的思想性和战斗性，除了经常开展批评和自我批评外，在许多重大问题或困难面前，他们特别注意先在党内统一思想，从而保证更好地完成任务。他们在劳动力紧张，生产任务迫切需要劳力的情况下，支部就通过组织生活反复讨论，号召每个党员拿出百折不挠的勇气来克服困难，完成任务。党员的积极性大大提高，纷纷带动群众苦干巧干，不但按时完成了任务，还抽出了二十八个劳动力支援了邻村播种小麦三天。（中共温州地委组织部工作组王钦雷、李大和）
