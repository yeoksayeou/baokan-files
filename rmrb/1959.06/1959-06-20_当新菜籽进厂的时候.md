    When New Rapeseeds Arrive at the Factory
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xu Shoujian, Wang Hongxian
    At midnight on June 12th, the surroundings were quiet. However, the Dasheng Oil Mill, located on the bank of the Huangpu River, was unusually bustling. This was the eve of the factory starting to press new rapeseeds. Before dawn, the oil pressing workers had to overhaul each machine. They were working hard to welcome the rapeseed oil pressing season.
    Workers Deng Lingen and Qian Qinglin, who should have been off work long ago, were now climbing on the tall steaming cylinders that were still radiating heat, installing the direct shafts of the steaming cylinders. The young man Qian Qinglin simply took off his shirt and worked bare-armed. Looking around from here, on the crisscrossing horizontal bars of the conveying rollers close to the ceiling, people were operating intensely at intervals. Every hammer strike made a deafening sound. Looking down, beside the oil presses, groups of workers were squatting down, refitting the press bars of the oil presses. Beside them were bowls full of rice and dishes, because they were too busy, they postponed their dinner.
    That night, the factory director and the workers fought together until dawn.
    On the afternoon of the 13th, the long-awaited time for the workers to start pressing new rapeseeds arrived. As people watched with bated breath, the technician turned on the power switch, and the worker turned on the switch of the screening machine, pouring the rapeseeds into the "hopper." In an instant, the clean rapeseeds ejected by the screening machine were transported to the rolling mill workshop by the conveying rollers, flattened by the rolling mill, ground by the grinding mill, and then automatically transported to the steaming cylinder for steaming and heating, entering the oil press. Worker Xie Fulin, waiting beside the oil press, flipped the switch, and a strong fragrance of rapeseed oil emanated from the oil outlet. The golden rapeseed oil flowed through the oil trough to the oil refining workshop for refining.
    On the 14th, on the Huangpu River shrouded in the misty dawn, sail boats, one after another, sailed away from the wharf near the Dasheng Oil Mill, heading towards the rural suburbs. The boats were loaded with warm, shiny, black rapeseed cakes. (Attached picture)

    当新菜籽进厂的时候
    新华社记者　徐寿鉴　王洪仙
    6月12日午夜，周围一片寂静。座落在黄浦江边的大生榨油厂，这时却出乎寻常地喧闹。这是工厂开榨新菜籽的前夕。在黎明到来前，榨油工人要把机器逐台检修一遍。他们为了迎接榨菜油季节的到来，正在紧张地工作着。
    早该下班的工人邓林根和钱庆林，这时正爬在高大的、还散发着热气的蒸缸上，装置蒸缸的直轴。小伙子钱庆林索性脱掉上衣，赤着臂膊干。从这里向四周望去，贴近天花板的、纵横交错的输送滚筒的横柱上，每隔不远，就有人在紧张地操作，鎯锤每一敲打，发出震人的声响。向下望，榨油机旁，一组组工人蹲着在改装榨油机的榨条。他们身旁摆着满碗的饭、菜，因为太忙，他们把夜饭推迟了。
    这天晚上，厂长和工人们一起战斗到黎明。
    13日下午，工人们盼望已久的新菜籽开榨时间到来了。在人们屏息凝视中，技术员打开电门，工人打开筛选机的开关，把菜籽倒入“料斗”。刹那间，筛选机吐出的干干净净的菜籽，被运输滚筒运到轧床车间，经过轧扁机轧扁，磨碎机磨研，又自动运到蒸缸烘蒸加热，进入榨油机。等待在榨油机旁的工人谢富林扳动开关，油口里顿时发出一阵浓郁的菜油香，黄澄澄的菜油经过油槽，流向炼油车间去精炼。
    14日，晨曦迷蒙的黄浦江上，帆船一艘接一艘，驶离了大生榨油厂附近的码头，航向市郊农村。船上装着带有热气的、亮晶晶乌油油的菜籽饼。（附图片）
