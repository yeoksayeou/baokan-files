Xinhua News Agency, June 6th dispatch from Managua: Nicaraguan dictator Somoza is adopting high-pressure and deceptive means to deal with the anti-dictatorial armed struggle within the country and the people's growing dissatisfaction.

Reports say that in the past few days alone, the dictatorial government has arrested 125 people on charges of opposing the government, while also conducting strict inspections of telegrams and telephones in the capital. On the 5th, the Nicaraguan government also dispatched planes and ships to patrol the coast all day long, guarding against foreign exiles opposing the dictatorial regime from re-entering the country.

In order to win people's hearts, dictator Somoza also stated on the evening of the 4th that Nicaragua's next presidential election will be completely "free." Somoza said ridiculously, "Nothing can change my firm determination that the next election will be a free election held with ballots and not bullets." However, he also said that he has absolutely no intention of leaving office before the expiration of his presidential term in 1963.

    尼加拉瓜暴君色厉内荏
    疯狂镇压人民反抗斗争
    新华社6日讯  马那瓜消息：尼加拉瓜独裁者索摩查正采取高压和欺骗的手段来对付国内反独裁的武装斗争和人民的日益增长的不满。
    消息说，仅仅在最近几天内，独裁政府就以反对政府的罪名逮捕了一百二十五人，同时对首都的电报和电话进行了严密的检查。5日那一天，尼加拉瓜政府还派出飞机和舰只整天地在海岸进行巡逻，提防反对独裁政权的国外流亡者再次进入国内。
    为了笼络人心，独裁者索摩查还在4日晚上表示：尼加拉瓜下次的总统选举将完全是“自由”的选举。索摩查很滑稽地说，“任何东西都不能改变我这样的一个坚定决心：下次选举将是用选票而不是用子弹举行的自由选举”。但是，他同时又说，在1963年总统的任期届满以前他绝对无意离职。
