    The Harvest of Friendship
    ——A Visit to the “Vietnam-Korea Friendship” Agricultural Cooperative
    People's Daily reporter Chen Jiabao

    In the Hanoi suburbs in May, the rice paddies stretched endlessly like a golden carpet. A gentle breeze stirred the rice, creating waves. In the villages, every household was busy drying rice, repairing threshing machines, and preparing for the harvest.
    On a sunny day, the sky was clear and blue. I rode my motorcycle along the lakeside road in the suburbs for about twenty kilometers and arrived at the “Vietnam-Korea Friendship” Agricultural Production Cooperative.
    The “Vietnam-Korea Friendship” Agricultural Cooperative was formerly called the “Chun Luo” Agricultural Cooperative, and it was only recently renamed.
    I first visited this agricultural cooperative a month ago. That day, the cooperative was holding a grand ceremony to accept an electric water pump and a thresher presented by Park Chung-ae, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and honorary member of the "Vietnam-Korea Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative. It was at this ceremony that the cooperative members unanimously decided to rename the cooperative the "Vietnam-Korea Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative as an eternal commemoration of the noble friendship between the two peoples.
    Zhu Wenxiang, the director of the agricultural cooperative, recalled the joyous scenes of Premier Kim Il-sung and Vice-Chairman Park Chung-ae visiting the agricultural cooperative last November in his speech at the meeting. He said excitedly: "Since then, we have received great honor. At the request of Park Chung-ae, we accepted her as a member of the 'Vietnam-Korea Friendship' Agricultural Cooperative."
    The reception was very successful. Thousands of cooperative members and farmers from other places who attended were deeply moved by the sincere international friendship. A female cooperative member said at the meeting:
    "We have only just started cooperating, and our Korean brothers thousands of miles away are already concerned about us. We must run the cooperative well and repay their concern with the best production results." From that day on, many cooperative members began to hang photos of the leaders of Vietnam and Korea and the national flags of the two countries in their homes. Also from that day on, the "Vietnam-Korea Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative and the Korean "Sangyang" Agricultural Cooperative began to establish a long-term relationship of exchanging experiences and helping each other. People call this relationship a "brotherly contract."
    A month later, I visited this familiar agricultural cooperative again. Although only a month had passed, new changes had taken place here. Walking into the village, I first discovered that the people's enthusiasm for work was higher than a month ago. The rice paddies were filled with groups of people digging ditches and drawing water. In the fish ponds, girls and boys sang folk songs while digging pond mud. They were engaged in a mud-digging competition. At the end of the village, the "manure accumulation team" was setting off with loads on their shoulders. In the fields, the rice ears were already turning yellow, growing stronger and more full than any previous crop. Zhu Wenxiang, the director of the agricultural cooperative, told me: "This year, we expect to harvest more than three tons per hectare, which is 50% more than when we worked individually."
    Construction pictures from Korea sent from thousands of miles away and photos of Korean labor heroes were hung in the village club, attracting a large group of primary school students. The club's blackboard newspaper published many poems by farmer poets, praising the deep friendship between the people of Vietnam and Korea. One poem read: "Seas may run dry, rocks may crumble, but our friendship will last as long as the sun and moon."
    Zhu Wenxiang, the director of the agricultural cooperative, and Nguyen Van Bi, the chairman of Chun Luo Village, led me to Zhu Wenxiang's thatched cottage, and then opened their hearts: "After the name change, everyone was both happy and worried. They were worried about how to run the cooperative well and live up to the glorious title of 'Vietnam-Korea Friendship.'" Zhu Wenxiang took a hard puff on a water pipe made of a section of thick bamboo, comfortably exhaled a wisp of thick smoke, and then added: "But everyone is very confident in this year's harvest. With confidence, there is a way."
    We sat cross-legged on the smooth and shiny wooden kang. Zhu Wenxiang began to talk about the establishment of the "Vietnam-Korea Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative and its recent work achievements.
    Counting from last November, the "Vietnam-Korea Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative will be half a year old. It is the first cooperative in the suburbs of Hanoi where all farmers in the village have joined, and it is also one of the largest agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs. All but three rich peasants and landlords in the village, the remaining eighty-seven laboring farmers have joined the cooperative.
    The Chun Luo Village branch of the Labor Party sent Nguyen Van Bi, the deputy secretary of the branch, to the city to study the policy of agricultural cooperation and the experience of building other agricultural cooperatives, and then returned to the village to lead the construction of Chun Luo Village.
    Before the establishment of the cooperative, eighty-seven farmers participated in the study of "Agricultural Cooperation Policy" and "Comparison of Two Social Systems." At the end of the twenty-day study, the first batch of forty poor peasants and more than ten lower-middle peasants excitedly submitted their applications to join the cooperative. Then, more than twenty other households also submitted their applications. Thus, on a clear morning in November, the Chun Luo Agricultural Cooperative was announced in the village amidst deafening gongs and drums.
    The news that the first village farmers joined the cooperative together reached the Presidential Palace of the Republic. A few days later, President Ho Chi Minh suddenly appeared in the fields of the Chun Luo Agricultural Cooperative, which made all the cooperative members very happy. People surrounded "Uncle Ho" layer by layer. President Ho encouraged the cooperative members to further raise their awareness, strengthen unity, and do a good job in production. Before leaving, he said to the cooperative members: "If you have a bumper rice harvest this summer, I will definitely come back to visit."
    Soon after, the cooperative also welcomed Premier Kim Il-sung and Comrade Park Chung-ae to visit, warmly welcoming the Korean people's deep friendship.
    The leaders' kind concern struck the hearts of more than four hundred cooperative members like a warm spring current. The happy meeting moved some people so much that they stayed awake all night, and went to work in the fields before dawn the next day.
    Under the leadership of the cooperative's management committee, all cooperative members plunged into the hot "For Friendship" spring plowing and production competition. In more than ten days, four production teams rushed to plant more than fifty hectares of summer rice and nearly thirty hectares of potatoes, sweet potatoes and other miscellaneous grains. This summer, the cooperative's cultivated area and fertilizer application have greatly exceeded the plan.
    At the end of April this year, five hectares of early-maturing potatoes achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a total harvest of more than twenty tons, more than doubling the highest yield in the village in previous years.
    The good news of the bumper harvest spread throughout the village, inspiring the hearts of the cooperative members. Collective labor and new farming techniques finally opened the first flower. The young cooperative fired the first shot of its first battle.
    Our conversation came to an end here. Nguyen Van Bi took me to visit the cooperative's warehouse. It was full of potatoes, and some of the potatoes were stored in the homes of cooperative members. Poor peasant Nguyen Van Tao pointed to the pile of potatoes in his home and said to me: "This year, we can't finish eating the potatoes. We have already picked the best potatoes to send to Uncle Ho and Honorary Member Comrade Park Chung-ae. If they hadn't encouraged us, our potatoes wouldn't have grown so well." He then said happily: "Now we are taking care of those dozens of hectares of summer rice day and night like taking care of our first child. We must make it a bumper harvest and prepare to welcome Uncle Ho to visit again."
    I visited the agricultural cooperative's newly built pigsty, and the fifty or so piglets were all growing quite fat. Fish fry were raised in the newly dug fish pond. Many newly planted banana trees had already sprouted long shoots. In the sweet potato fields, the vines grew a lush green, and the breeze brought bursts of mountain songs. Everywhere was filled with a lively atmosphere.
    While walking, Nguyen Van Bi talked about the agricultural cooperative's new plans: "This year, we will raise one hundred pigs, accumulate one thousand tons of fertilizer, raise several hundred kilograms of fish, five thousand ducks, plant eight hundred fruit trees, build a brick and tile factory and a granular fertilizer factory. After harvesting the autumn rice at the end of the year, the income of the cooperative members is estimated to increase by one to two times compared to when they worked individually. At that time, the thatched roofs of some cooperative members will be replaced with tiled roofs, and the dirt road in front of the cooperative will be repaired and widened so that guests from Korea can drive directly into the village... Of course, these are just the first steps."
    Nguyen Van Bi became more and more excited as he talked. His words are also the determination of more than four hundred cooperative members. Based on what I have seen and heard here, I fully believe that the people of Chun Luo Village, who have a tradition of heroic struggle, will surely be able to turn that planned picture into a beautiful reality in the near future.

    友谊的丰收
    ——“越朝友谊”农业合作社访问记
    本报记者　陈家保
    5月的河内郊区，稻田像金黄色的地毯漫无边际。清风过处，稻浪滚滚。村落里，家家户户忙着晒谷围、修打谷机，准备收割稻子。
    在一个阳光灿烂的日子，万里碧空，洁净如洗，我骑着摩托车顺着郊区湖堤路走了约莫二十公里，来到“越朝友谊”农业生产合作社。
    “越朝友谊”农业社过去叫做“春罗”农业社，最近才改为现在的名字。
    一个月前，我第一次访问了这个农业社。那天，社里正在举行着隆重的仪式，接受朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长、“越朝友谊”农业社的名誉社员朴正爱赠送的电动抽水机和打谷机。就在这个仪式上，社员们一致决定把社名改为“越朝友谊”农业社，作为两国人民崇高的友谊的永恒纪念。
    农业社主任朱文祥在会上讲话时，追述到去年11月金日成首相和朴正爱副委员长访问农业社时的欢乐情景。他激动地说：“从那时起，我们获得巨大的荣誉，根据朴正爱的要求，我们接受她为‘越朝友谊’农业社的社员。”
    那天的受礼大会开得很成功。到会的成千名社员和从外地来的农民都被真挚的国际友谊所深深感动。一位女社员在大会上说：
  “我们大伙才合作，几千里外的朝鲜兄弟就这样地为我们操心。我们一定要搞好合作社，用最好的生产成绩来报答他们的关怀。”从那天起，许多社员的家里，开始并挂着越朝两国领袖的照片和两国国旗。也从那天起，“越朝友谊”农业社同朝鲜“上阳”农业社开始建立了长期交流经验和互助的关系。人们把这种关系叫做“兄弟合同”。
    一个月后的今天，我又一次到这个熟悉的农业社里作客。虽只隔别一个月，但这里已经起了新的变化。走进村子，我首先发现，人们的劳动热情比一个月前更加高涨了。稻田里到处是一队队正在挖渠戽水的人群。鱼塘里，姑娘和小伙子们边唱着山歌，边挖掘塘泥。他们正在进行挖泥竞赛。村那头，“积肥大队”正在挑着担子出发。地里，稻穗已经透黄，长得比过去任何一造都要结实多穗。农业社主任朱文祥对我说：“今年每公顷可望收获三吨多，比单干时要多五成。”
    从千里以外寄来的朝鲜建设图片、朝鲜劳动英雄的照片张挂在村前的俱乐部里，正在吸引着一大群小学生。俱乐部的墙报上发表许多农民诗人的诗篇，歌颂着越朝两国人民的深情厚谊。一首诗这样写道：“海可枯，石可烂，我们的友谊将同日月长存。”
    农业社主任朱文祥和春罗村主席阮文卑把我领到朱文祥的茅屋里，然后打开他们的话匣：“改了社名，大伙又是乐又是担心，担心的是怎样办好社，好够得上‘越朝友谊’这个光荣的称号。”朱文祥在一节粗竹筒做的水烟管上狠狠地吸了一口，舒畅地吐出了一缕浓烟，然后添上一句：“可是大伙对今年的庄稼都挺有信心。有信心就有办法。”
    我们盘膝坐在光滑发亮的木头炕上。朱文祥开始畅谈“越朝友谊”农业社成立的经过和它最近的工作成绩。
    从去年11月算起，“越朝友谊”农业社成立迄今将满半年。它是河内市郊第一个全村农户一起入社的合作社，也是目前郊区最大的农业社之一。全村除了三家富农和地主以外，其余八十七户劳动农民都加入了合作社。
    劳动党春罗村支部派了支部副书记阮文卑到城里学习关于农业合作化的政策和别的农业社的建社经验，然后回到村里领导春罗村的建社工作。
    建社前，八十七个农户都参加了“农业合作化政策”和“两个社会制度对比”的学习。二十多天的学习结束了，第一批四十户贫农和十多户下中农兴高采烈地递交了入社申请书。接着，其他二十多户也交了申请书。于是在11月一个清早，春罗农业社在全村震天的锣鼓声中宣告成立了。
    第一个全村农民一起入社的消息传到了共和国主席府。几天之后，胡志明主席忽然出现在春罗农业社的田野上，这下子可乐坏了全社社员。人们把“胡伯伯”层层围住。胡主席勉励社员们要进一步提高觉悟，加强团结和搞好生产。他老人家临走前对社员们说：“要是今年夏天你们的稻子丰收，我回头一定再来作客。”
    过了不久，合作社又迎接了金日成首相和朴正爱同志前来访问，热烈欢迎贵宾们带来了朝鲜人民的深厚友谊。
    领袖们的亲切关怀像一股春天的暖流冲激着四百多名社员的心，幸福的会见使好些人感动得彻夜不眠，第二天天还没亮就到地里去干活了。
    在社的管理委员会的领导下，全体社员投入了热火朝天的“为了友谊”的春耕生产竞赛。在十多天之内，四个生产组突击种了五十多公顷夏稻和将近三十公顷的土豆、红薯等杂粮。今夏，这个社的耕作面积和施肥量都大大超额完成计划。
    今年4月底，五公顷早熟的土豆获得了空前丰收，总收获量达到二十多吨，比历年村里最高产量增加了一倍。
    丰收的喜讯传遍了整个村庄，振奋着社员们的心。集体的劳动和新的耕作技术终于开放了第一朵鲜花。年轻的合作社初战的第一炮打响了。
    我们的谈话到此告一段落。阮文卑带我去参观合作社的仓库。那里土豆积满仓，还有一部分土豆寄放在社员家里。贫农阮文陶指着他家那堆土豆对我说：“今年土豆吃也吃不完。我们已经拣了最好的土豆送给胡伯伯和名誉社员朴正爱同志。要不是他们给我们打气，我们的土豆不会长得那么好”。他接着高兴地说：“现在我们像照顾头胎子那样日夜照料着那几十公顷夏稻，一定要叫它丰收，准备迎接胡伯伯再来作客。”
    我参观了农业社新建的养猪棚，五十多头乳猪都长得挺胖。新挖的鱼塘里养着鱼秧。新栽的许多香蕉树已经冒出长长的嫩芽。红薯地里，薯藤长得一片翠绿，微风带来一阵阵山歌声。到处充满了生气勃勃的生活气息。
    阮文卑一边走一边谈着农业社的新规划：“今年，我们要养一百头猪，积造一千吨肥，养几百公斤鱼、五千只鸭，种八百棵果树，盖一座砖瓦工厂和一座颗粒肥料厂。到年底割了秋稻以后，社员的收入估计要比单干时增加一倍到两倍。那时，一部分社员的茅屋顶就要换成瓦顶，合作社前面的泥路也要修整和加宽，让从朝鲜来的客人可以坐着汽车一直进到村里来……当然，这些只是第一步。”
    阮文卑越谈越起劲。他的话也就是四百多名社员的决心。以我在这里的所见所闻，我完全相信，具有英勇战斗传统的春罗村人民，在不久的将来一定能够把那幅规划的图景变为美丽的现实。
