Xinhua News Agency, June 17th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has received a statement from the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) regarding the Tibetan issue. The statement says: "We Japanese workers believe that the Tibetan rebellion was stirred up by a small group in Tibet and foreign interventionists, and is an infringement upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This has been clearly pointed out in the resolution of the National People's Congress of China, and we friendly support this resolution."

The statement continues, "We are sincerely pleased that the bloody conflict caused by the rebel group has been quelled."

This statement was adopted by the Sohyo Standing Committee at its 12th meeting held on June 8th.

The statement points out that, at the time of the rebellion, despite the propaganda by imperialist elements and some people in Japan who followed imperialism, who slandered the People's Republic of China, the Japanese working class believed that this was a shameful act by imperialist elements to interfere in China's internal affairs, and therefore it was bound to fail. The statement says that we believe that the Tibetan rebellion and the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" are merely part of the policies of imperialist elements and their followers who are attempting to intensify the tense situation in the Far East.

The statement emphasizes, "In order to defend Japan's peace, prosperity and the vital interests of the nation, we adhere to the principles of the Bandung spirit and strongly oppose imperialist elements' interference in internal affairs. We believe that this will help promote mutual understanding between the people of China and Japan, and will make a great contribution to the friendship and unity of the people of China and Japan. We will certainly wage a courageous struggle against the imperialist elements in Japan who are currently using the Tibet issue to carry out anti-China and anti-socialist propaganda, and we will launch a powerful struggle to crush this force."

    日本“总评”就西藏叛乱事件发表声明
    干涉中国内政的行为必定失败
    新华社17日讯　中华全国总工会收到了日本工会总评议会关于西藏问题的声明，声明说：“我们日本工人认为，西藏叛乱是西藏的少数集团和外国干涉者掀起来的，是对中国的主权和领土完整的侵犯。这在中国全国人民代表大会的决议中已经清楚地指出，我们友好地支持这个决议。”
    声明又说，“叛乱集团所引起的流血冲突已被平息，我们由衷地感到高兴。”
    这个声明是总评议会干事会在6月8日举行的第十二次会议上通过的。
    声明指出，在叛乱当时，尽管帝国主义分子及追随帝国主义分子的日本国内一部分人进行非难中华人民共和国的宣传，日本工人阶级就认为这是帝国主义分子干涉中国内政的可耻行为，因而必定失败。声明说，我们认为，西藏叛乱，改订日美“安全条约”，都只不过是企图加剧远东紧张局势的帝国主义分子及其追随者的政策的一部分。
    声明强调说，“我们为了保卫日本的和平、繁荣和民族的切身利益，坚持万隆精神的原则，强烈地反对帝国主义分子干涉内政。我们认为，这将有助于中日两国人民的相互了解，并且对中日两国人民的友好和团结将作出很大贡献。我们必将与当前日本国内利用西藏问题进行反对中国、反对社会主义宣传的帝国主义分子进行勇敢的斗争，并且为粉碎这种势力而展开强有力的斗争。”
