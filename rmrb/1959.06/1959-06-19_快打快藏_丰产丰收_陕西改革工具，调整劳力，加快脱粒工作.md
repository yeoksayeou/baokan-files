This newspaper reports from Xi'an on the 18th of June: Shaanxi Province is mobilizing the masses to improve threshing tools and methods, accelerate the threshing process, and ensure that summer grain is stored in warehouses ahead of schedule.

Currently, the summer grain in the southern region of Shaanxi Province has all been brought to the threshing ground, the eastern part of Guanzhong is nearing the end of harvesting, and the western part of Guanzhong is harvesting intensely. However, the threshing work is generally slow. In some places, less than one-tenth has been threshed, and in some places, no threshing has been done yet.

The main reasons for the slow threshing are that some cadres and commune members believe that once the wheat is brought to the threshing ground, it is not afraid of wind and rain and can be threshed slowly. Some places spread the wheat in the morning, thresh it at noon and in the evening, threshing only once a day. Some places have backward threshing tools and few threshing grounds. For example, in the southern Shaanxi area, people use flails to thresh wheat, and one person can thresh only 60 to 70 jin a day, with the highest being no more than 90 jin. In addition, during this period, it is necessary to seize the time to plant late autumn crops, strengthen field management of cotton fields and early autumn crops. The workload is very large, and the timeliness is strong. The original labor organization and labor quotas are not fully adapted, which also affects threshing.

In order to speed up the threshing work, some places used meal times and field breaks to organize commune members to debate issues such as "Is wheat considered received once it is brought to the threshing ground?" to raise ideological awareness. Some places have taken many specific measures to improve threshing efficiency. For example, southern and northern Shaanxi have changed the habit of using flails to thresh wheat and switched to using stone rollers to thresh. After the Chengguan, Gaochuan, and Guanshan communes in Xixiang County adopted stone rollers for threshing, one person and one animal can thresh more than 1,200 jin a day, increasing work efficiency by 17 to 18 times compared to using flails. The communes in Hanzhong City used various tools and methods such as mixing barrels and threshing machines to thresh according to local conditions, and completed threshing of 60% of the wheat in six days.

In order to speed up the threshing work, most areas have adjusted their labor organizations. After the wheat was harvested in the Xinfeng Commune of Lintong County, 50% of the labor force was assigned to thresh wheat, 30% to rush to plant autumn fields and deliver manure, and 20% to be responsible for cotton field management, according to their physical strength, technical level, personal expertise, and the amount of summer planting tasks. The Guandao People's Commune in Weinan County launched a movement of "women replacing men, the weak replacing the strong" in canteens and breeding farms, and drew more than 300 strong laborers to participate in threshing work. Most areas have expanded and increased threshing grounds, increased the number of threshing sessions, and changed the threshing methods. Qian County, Xianyang, Xingping, Zhouzhi and other counties and cities took advantage of the moisture to expand the threshing grounds. Qian County alone expanded the threshing grounds by more than 3,500 plots. Many places have increased the number of threshing sessions from one to three per day, fighting hard day and night. Some places adopted a continuous flow threshing method of rolling head threshing ground, drying the second threshing ground, rolling the second threshing ground, and drying the third threshing ground. Alternatively, they would thresh dry wheat in the morning, thresh wet wheat at noon, thresh wheat straw in the afternoon, and winnow in the evening to speed up threshing. After the Longmen Production Team of the Longmen Management Area of the Hancheng Xiya Commune adopted the above methods, the daily threshing amount increased from more than 30,000 jin to more than 70,000 jin.

### 快打快藏　丰产丰收  陕西改革工具，调整劳力，加快脱粒工作

    快打快藏　丰产丰收
    陕西改革工具，调整劳力，加快脱粒工作
    本报西安18日电　陕西省各地发动群众改进脱粒工具和方法，加快脱粒进度，保证夏粮提前入仓。
    目前，陕西省南部地区的夏粮已全部登场，关中东部已近收割尾声，关中西部地区正在紧张收割。但是脱粒工作一般都比较迟缓。有些地方脱粒的不到十分之一，有些地方还没有脱粒。
    脱粒迟缓的主要原因是，有些地区的干部和社员认为，麦子割到场啦，不怕风吹雨打，可以慢慢脱粒；有些地方是上午摊场，中午和晚上碾场，一天只碾一场麦；有些地方的脱粒工具落后，麦场少。例如陕南地区群众用“槤枷”打麦，一人一天脱粒六、七十斤，最高的也不过九十斤。除此以外，这个时期既要抓紧种晚秋，还要加强棉田和早秋作物的田间管理，工作量很大，时间性很强，原来的劳动组织、劳动定额就不完全适应了，这也影响了脱粒。
    为了加快脱粒工作，有些地方利用吃饭和田头休息时间，组织社员辩论“麦子上场是否就算收到手里”等问题，提高思想认识。有些地方采取了许多具体措施，提高脱粒效率。例如陕南和陕北改变了用“槤枷”打麦的习惯，改用碌碡（石滚）碾场。西乡县城关、高川、贯山等公社采用碌碡碾场后，一人一畜一天能脱粒一千二百多斤；比用“槤枷”打麦提高工效十七、八倍。汉中市各公社根据各地具体条件，用拌桶、打谷机等多种工具多种办法脱粒，六天中即把60％的小麦脱粒完毕。
    为了加快脱粒工作，多数地区都调整了劳动组织。临潼县新丰公社在麦子割完以后，按照体力强弱、技术高低和个人专长，以及夏播任务的多少，抽出50％劳力脱粒小麦，30％的劳力抢种秋田和送粪，20％劳力负责棉田管理。渭南县官道人民公社在食堂和饲养厂中开展了以女代男、以弱代强运动，抽出了三百多名强劳力投入脱粒工作。大部分地区都扩大和增设场地，增加碾打场次，改变碾打的办法。乾县、咸阳、兴平、盩厔等县市趁墒扩大了场面，仅乾县就扩大场面三千五百多块。很多地方把原来一天一场提高到三场，日夜苦战。有些地方采用碾头场、晒二场；碾二场，晒三场的流水碾场法，或者是早晨碾干麦，中午碾湿麦，下午碾麦秸，晚上扬场的方法，加快脱粒。韩城西压公社龙门管理区龙门生产队采用上述方法后，每日脱粒由三万多斤增加到七万多斤。
