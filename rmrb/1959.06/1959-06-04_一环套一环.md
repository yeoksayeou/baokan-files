    With the rapid development of workers' spare-time education, training teachers has become an urgent task.

    Popularizing education among workers is a very important task. Since last year, thanks to the strengthening of leadership by the Party and the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers for learning, spare-time education for workers in industrial and mining enterprises across the country has developed rapidly. The majority of young and middle-aged workers have already emerged from illiteracy, and workers' education has entered the stage of popularizing primary education. Moreover, more than 50% of the workers participating in learning will soon be transferred to junior high school in batches. This situation shows that, in addition to continuing to actively eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged workers and popularizing primary education, massively developing secondary schools, especially junior high schools, will be an important link in the development of workers' education in our country in the next few years.

    In order to adapt to this new situation, in terms of training teachers, it is also necessary to proceed link by link. It is necessary to seize the opportunity to train teachers for literacy and primary education, and also to seize the opportunity to train teachers for secondary education.

    The training of teachers for workers' education should also implement the policy of walking on two legs. One is to take local materials and select talented people as teachers, mobilizing cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers with higher technical and cultural levels in the local area and unit to concurrently serve as teachers. The other is to take measures as early as possible to develop normal schools, teacher training classes, and spare-time normal schools to further expand the ranks of teachers and improve their political and cultural levels and teaching skills. All regions, industrial systems, and industrial and mining enterprises with the necessary conditions must seize the opportunity to train teachers.

    When training teachers, attention should also be paid to two aspects: it is necessary to train and improve part-time teachers, and also to train and improve full-time teachers; this is also a link by link in the training of teachers. If the improvement of part-time teachers is not grasped, it will be difficult to complete the tasks on the workers' education front; if the improvement of full-time teachers is neglected, it will be difficult for full-time teachers to play a backbone role in workers' education. Now, the Beijing Railway Bureau focuses on training full-time teachers, organizing them to participate in productive labor, transform their thinking, learn production knowledge, and improve teaching methods; at the same time, it mobilizes and encourages them to pursue further studies in their spare time to improve their political and ideological level, cultural level, and teaching skills to adapt to the development of workers' education. This method of training full-time teachers can be used as a reference by various regions.

    一环套一环
    任志樵
    随着职工业余教育的迅速发展，培训师资已经成为一项刻不容缓的任务。
    在职工中普及教育是个十分重要的工作。去年以来，由于党加强了领导和广大职工学习热情的空前高涨，全国工矿企业的职工业余教育迅速发展起来。大多数青壮年职工已经脱离了文盲状态，职工教育已经进入普及初等教育的阶段，而且参加学习的50％以上的职工，即将成批地转入初级中学学习。这个情况说明，除了继续积极扫除青壮年职工中的文盲和普及初等教育外，大量发展中等学校、首先是初级中学，将是我国几年内发展职工教育的一个重要环节。
    为了适应这个新形势，在培养师资方面，也要一环套一环。既要抓紧培养扫除文盲和小学教育的教师，还要抓紧培养中等教育的教师。
    培养职工教育的师资，也要贯彻两条腿走路的方针。一是能者为师，就地取材，在本地区、本单位中，发动在职干部、工程技术人员和技术、文化水平较高的工人，兼任教学工作。一是及早地采取措施，发展师范学校、师资训练班和业余师范学校，进一步扩大教师的队伍，提高教师的政治、文化水平和教学水平。凡是有条件的地区、产业系统和工矿企业，都要抓紧师资培训工作。
    在培训师资的时候，也要注意两个方面：既要培养和提高兼职教师，还要培养和提高专职教师；这也是在培养师资上的一环套一环。如果不抓兼职教师的提高，就很难完成职工教育战线上的任务；如果忽视了抓专职教师的提高，专职教师将很难在职工教育工作中起骨干作用。现在，北京铁路局集中培训专职教师，组织他们参加生产劳动，改造思想，学习生产知识，改进教学方法；同时发动和鼓励他们在业余进修，提高他们的政治思想水平、文化水平和教学水平，以适应职工教育的发展。这种培训专职教师的办法，各地可作参考。
