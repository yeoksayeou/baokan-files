Ledu Seedling Cultivation Presents a New Situation
Comprehensive labor arrangements, the establishment of professional seedling teams, integration of seedling cultivation with diversified operations, and combining current and long-term interests.
Ma Renchen, Miao Zhiguo

In the past, mass seedling cultivation work in Ledu County, Qinghai, was relatively poor. Most of the seedlings needed for mass afforestation were supplied by state-owned nurseries. Some people believed that cultivating seedlings on arable land would definitely reduce income, so the land used for seedling cultivation was mostly very poor or unsuitable for agricultural production. In addition, without dedicated management, the quantity and quality of the seedlings cultivated were low. This led some people to mistakenly believe that: "One year of cultivation, two years of wasteland, three years transformed into pasture."

In 1958, under the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the masses liberated their thinking, and their understanding of forestry production gradually became correct. As a result, forestry production, like other socialist construction undertakings, achieved unprecedented success. Seedling cultivation work in Ledu County also saw a new situation. Currently, all communes in the county have allocated some arable land for nurseries and have established permanent professional seedling teams. At present, the county has six mass nurseries that have been expanded or newly built, each exceeding 100 mu, five with 50 to 100 mu, and four with 30 to 50 mu.

How did Ledu achieve these results?

In order to ensure the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other industries in the face of insufficient rural labor, the County Party Committee made comprehensive and reasonable arrangements for the county's labor force at the Party Congress. In terms of forestry, in addition to the mass afforestation campaigns, 0.3% of the labor force was extracted to form professional teams to manage forestry year-round. Experience has proven that the smooth development of seedling cultivation work is guaranteed only with the establishment of seedling cultivation professional teams in each commune.

Integrating seedling cultivation with diversified operations has a promotional effect on seedling cultivation. In 1958, Gangou Brigade of Qutan Commune intercropped garlic, scallions, and other vegetables in a 24-mu nursery, earning more than 2,000 yuan. Due to the increased application of fertilizer and strengthened management during the intercropping of vegetables, not only was the growth of seedlings not affected, but the quality and quantity of seedlings were also improved. Vegetables mature in summer, which can also provide shade for some coniferous tree species. This method of increasing land utilization and increasing income combines current and long-term interests. Under the impetus of this nursery, the entire Qutan Commune extracted more than 300 mu of arable land and more than 90 people to specialize in seedling cultivation.

The active assistance of agricultural and forestry departments in solving technical problems is also indispensable. In the context of the large-scale development of mass seedling cultivation with insufficient technical force, Ledu County has opened training classes, training a total of 427 forestry workers. At the same time, county forestry cadres provided concrete assistance to various nurseries. With the help of the County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and various agricultural and forestry work stations, most nurseries have formulated a 1959 nursery production plan. The County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has also provided appropriate support to some nurseries lacking tree species and vegetable seeds.

    乐都育苗出现新局面
    全面安排劳力，成立育苗专业队，结合育苗开展多种经营，把当前利益和长远利益结合起来了。
    马壬辰　缪志国
    青海乐都县以往的群众育苗工作是较差的。群众造林所需要的苗木，大部分都由国营苗圃供应。有些人认为耕地育苗一定要减少收入，所以育苗所用的土地，绝大部分都是很不好的或不能用于农业生产的。再加无专人管理，育出来的苗木数量少质量差。这样就使一些人产生一种错觉，认为：一年育，二年荒，三年变牧场。
    1958年在党的正确领导及总路线的光辉照耀下，群众解放了思想，对林业生产的认识逐渐端正了，因而林业生产和其他各项社会主义建设事业一样，取得了空前未有的成绩。乐都县的育苗工作也出现一个新的局面。目前，全县各公社都抽出了部分耕地作苗圃，而且固定了育苗专业队。目前全县扩建或新建的群众苗圃一百亩以上者六处，五十到一百亩者五处，三十到五十亩者四处。
    乐都是怎样取得这些成绩的呢？
    为了在农村劳动力的不足的情况下使农林牧等业全面发展，县委在党代会上对全县劳力进行了全面的合理的安排。林业方面除去全民性的突击造林外，并抽出0.3％的劳力组成专业队，常年经营林业。经验证明，各公社成立了育苗专业队，育苗工作的顺利发展才有保证。
    结合育苗开展多种经营，对育苗有促进作用。瞿昙公社岗沟大队，1958年在二十四亩的苗圃地中，间作蒜葱等蔬菜，收入二千多元。在间作蔬菜中由于增施了肥料，加强了管理，不但没有影响苗木生长，而且苗木质量和数量都有所提高。蔬菜在夏季成熟，对一些针叶树种，还可以起遮阴作用。这种既提高了土地利用率又增加收入的办法，正是把当前利益与长远利益结合起来。在这个苗圃的带动下，整个瞿昙公社抽出了三百多亩耕地和九十多个人专门育苗。
    农林部门主动帮助解决技术方面的问题，也是不可缺少的。在群众育苗大发展技术力量不足的情况下，乐都县开办了训练班，先后共训练了四百二十七个林业员。同时县林业干部到各苗圃进行具体帮助。绝大部分苗圃，在县农林局及各农林工作站的帮助下，制定了1959年苗圃生产计划。对一些缺少树种和菜种的苗圃，县农林局也给了适当支援。
