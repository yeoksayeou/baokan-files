Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 1st: As of early May, Jiangxi Province had completed the harvesting of over three million mu of rapeseed, achieving a large-scale bumper harvest.

Through actual harvesting and threshing, many large-scale rapeseed high-yield areas have emerged across the province. There are 7,400 mu with an average yield of 200 to 300 jin per mu; 8,000 mu with an average yield of 120 to 150 jin; and 4,400 mu with an average yield of over 100 jin.

Areas that historically had low rapeseed yields have also increased production this year. In Meizhuang People's Commune, Jinxian County, rapeseed planted on hilly terrain and red soil achieved an average yield of over 300 jin per mu on 410 mu due to mastering key steps such as early sowing, early seedling establishment, early fertilization, and early soil loosening, increasing the unit area yield by more than tenfold compared to last year. Guangchang County, which previously planted very little rapeseed, expanded its planting area to 17,000 mu this year, focusing on yield-increasing measures such as seed selection, field selection, deep plowing, and close planting, and consistently strengthening field management, resulting in an average yield of over 200 jin per mu on more than 7,000 mu of rapeseed, an increase of more than fivefold compared to last year. Tonggu County, located in the midst of towering mountains, also saw an average yield of 150 jin per mu on over 1,000 mu of rapeseed this year, an increase of nearly twofold compared to last year.

During rapeseed harvesting and threshing, all localities paid great attention to selecting high-yield, superior varieties with early maturity, tall seedlings, numerous branches, and full grains, ensuring good selection, good drying, and good storage. To learn from this year's large-scale rapeseed bumper harvest experience and ensure an even greater harvest next year, many regions have also organized visiting groups to visit and hold discussions in large-scale high-yield rapeseed areas, summarizing and exchanging large-scale high-yield experiences.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 1st: Anhui Province has completed rapeseed harvesting, with many communes achieving large-scale bumper harvests.

Currently, key rapeseed producing areas are concentrating their efforts on drying and threshing. Some threshing has essentially been completed, and based on the threshing situation in various places, the unit area yield of rapeseed this year far exceeds last year. TunGuang People's Commune in Xiuning County has threshed 3,150 mu of its 4,000 mu of rapeseed, yielding 640,050 jin of rapeseed, an average yield of more than 203 jin per mu, an increase of more than twofold compared to last year. After several days of intense and meticulous harvesting, Yuan Wangjiang County's Koudong People's Commune's 4,100 mu of rapeseed yielded a total of 533,300 jin, an average yield of more than 130 jin per mu, an increase of more than twofold compared to last year. Xinmin Commune's Yixin Brigade in Wuwei County harvested 131,560 jin of clean rapeseed from its 577 mu of rapeseed from May 13th to 18th, an average yield of 228 jin per mu, an increase of more than twofold compared to last year. Huayang River Farm harvested 3.15 million jin of rapeseed from its 15,000 mu of rapeseed, an average yield of 210 jin per mu.

In order to ensure that the fruits of the harvest return home, all localities have put forward the slogans of "Four Lights" (light harvesting, light placing, light bundling, light carrying) and "Three Quicks" (quick harvesting, quick transporting, quick threshing), achieving harvesting, transportation, and threshing simultaneously. XuanCheng County mobilized over 21,000 people during the harvest to rush transportation and threshing. Some places adopted various effective methods to overcome the difficulties of threshing on rainy days. For example, NingGuo County proposed the method of "threshing outdoors on sunny days, indoors on cloudy days, and using rice buckets throughout," and ensured turning, drying, and threshing simultaneously. In order to prevent rapeseed from mildewing due to rain, Xinlin People's Commune in Fanchang County rushed to transport and thresh rapeseed with lights on in the light rain, threshing 1,965 mu of rapeseed in one day and one night, accounting for 74% of the commune's rapeseed planting area.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 1st: Henan Province's 450,000 mu of rapeseed has been completely harvested, and bumper harvest reports are continuously pouring in.

Guangshan County has already threshed 14,537 mu of rapeseed, yielding a total of 1,500,821.75 jin of rapeseed, with an average yield per mu increasing by 67.7% compared to last year, reaching 103.75 jin, including 1,214 mu with a yield of 150 to 200 jin per mu, and 85 mu with 300 jin per mu. Huangchuan County has already threshed 30,340 mu, with an average yield of 86.6 jin per mu, an increase of 46% compared to last year. The Shangyougang People's Commune's Sitai Brigade in this county has 3.7 mu of rapeseed, with an average yield of 547.5 jin per mu. The Huangfanqu Farm in Xihua County, which planted rapeseed for the first time, has already finished threshing 1,200 mu of rapeseed, with an average yield of 80 jin per mu.

The vegetable oil consumed by the people of Henan Province is mainly peanut oil and sesame oil, and they rarely eat rapeseed oil, so there are not many rapeseed plantings. In the past, when rapeseed was planted, the cultivation was relatively extensive, so the harvest was not high. This year's bumper harvest of rapeseed is mainly due to the attention of the Party and government leaders at all levels, who led the masses to further implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and changed the extensive cultivation situation. Generally, the rapeseed fields in the province have adopted measures such as deep plowing, heavy fertilization, rational close planting, and timely irrigation.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 1st: The first production team of the first farming district of the Guihu People's Commune in Xindu County, Sichuan Province, planted 190.038 mu of rapeseed, with a total output of 95,372 jin, an average yield of 501 jin and 15 liang per mu. The more than 190 mu of rapeseed generally grew with large branches and numerous pods, with each plant bearing more than 1,000 pods, the pods tightly packed together. The highest yielding 1.95 mu had a unit yield of 645 jin; the lowest yielding 1.57 mu had a yield of 408.4 jin per mu. The total yield increased nearly fourfold compared to the local average yield of 113 jin per mu last year.

The harvesting of these more than 190 mu of rapeseed began on May 15th. Those who participated in the harvesting, threshing, winnowing, and weighing included the inspection team of the Wenjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the deputy county heads and deputy directors of the CPPCC from 17 counties in the Wenjiang Prefecture, Huang Haixiang, the first secretary of the Xindu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and some responsible comrades from the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Sichuan Provincial-level organs. In order to further verify the output, the Xindu County Committee of the Communist Party of China also specially formed a working group to conduct a review and measure the fields. (Image attached)

    油菜香千里　丰产连成片
    江西安徽河南三省油菜收割完菜籽堆满仓
    四川桂湖公社一九○亩油菜亩产五○一斤，比去年增产近四倍
    本报南昌1日电　江西省截至5月上旬，全省三百多万亩油菜已全部收割完毕，获得了大面积丰收。
    经过实收实打，全省出现了许多大面积油菜丰产区。成片的、产量每亩平均达到二百斤至三百斤以上的有七千四百亩；平均产量达到一百二十斤至一百五十斤的有八千亩；平均产量超过一百斤的有四千四百亩。
    历年油菜产量相当低的地区，今年也增产了。进贤县梅庄人民公社在丘陵地和红土壤上种植的油菜，由于掌握了早播种、早定苗、早施肥、早松土等几个重要环节，有四百一十亩油菜平均亩产三百斤以上，比去年单位面积产量提高十倍多。广昌县过去种油菜很少，今年种植面积扩大到一万七千亩，抓住了选种、选田、深耕、密植等增产措施，并始终不懈地加强了田间管理，因而其中七千多亩油菜产量平均每亩达二百斤以上，比去年每亩增产五倍多。位于崇山峻岭间的铜鼓县，今年也有一千多亩油菜平均每亩产量达一百五十斤，比去年增产近两倍。
    各地在油菜收割与脱粒当中，十分重视选择成熟期早、苗高、枝多、粒满等高产的优良品种，并做到选好、晒好、藏好。为吸取今年油菜大面积丰产经验，保证明年油菜获得更大丰收，许多地区还组织了参观团到大面积油菜丰产区进行访问、座谈，总结与交流大面积丰产经验。
    据新华社合肥1日电　安徽省油菜收割结束，很多公社获得了大面积丰产。
    目前油菜籽重点产区正集中力量进行翻晒脱粒工作，有的脱粒已基本结束，从各地已脱粒情况看，今年油菜籽的单位面积产量大大超过去年。休宁县屯光人民公社种植的四千亩油菜，已脱粒三千一百五十亩，实收菜籽六十四万零五十斤，平均亩产二百零三斤多，比去年增加二倍以上。原望江县?口人民公社经过几天紧张、细致的收打，全社四千一百亩油菜，总产五十三万三千三百斤，平均亩产一百三十斤多，比去年增加一倍多。无为县新民公社一心大队五百七十七亩油菜，从5月13日开镰收割、到18日收打结束，实收净菜籽十三万一千五百六十斤，平均亩产二百二十八斤，比去年增加一倍多。华阳河农场一万五千亩油菜，已净收三百一十五万斤菜籽，平均亩产二百一十斤。
    为了保证丰收的果实颗粒还家，各地在收割中都提出了“四轻”（轻割、轻放、轻捆、轻挑）、“三快”（快收、快运、快打）的口号，做到边收割、边运输、边脱粒。宣城县在收割时抽出二万一千多人，突击运输和脱粒。有些地方为了克服雨天无法脱粒的困难，采取了各种有效办法，如宁国县提出“晴天室外打、阴天室内打、全用稻桶打”的办法，并做到边翻、边晾、边打。繁昌县新林人民公社为防止油菜籽因雨发生霉烂，曾点灯冒细雨突击抢运、脱粒，一天一夜脱粒油菜一千九百六十五亩，占这个公社油菜种植面积的74％。
    据新华社郑州1日电　河南省四十五万亩油菜已经全部割完，不断传出丰收捷报。
    光山县已经脱粒的一万四千五百三十七亩油菜，共收菜籽一百五十万零八千二百一十三点七五斤，平均每亩产量比去年提高67.7％，达到一百零三点七五斤，其中亩产一百五十斤到二百斤的有一千二百一十四亩，三百斤的有八十五亩。潢川县已经脱粒的三万零三百四十亩，平均亩产八十六点六斤，比去年提高46％。这个县上油岗人民公社四台大队有三点七亩油菜，平均亩产五百四十七点五斤。第一次种植油菜的西华县黄泛区农场，一千二百亩油菜已经全部打完，平均亩产八十斤。
    河南人民食用的植物油主要是花生油、芝麻油，很少吃菜籽油，所以种油菜的不多。过去种油菜时，耕作也比较粗放，因此收获量不高。今年油菜籽获得大丰收，主要是由于各地党、政领导重视，领导群众进一步贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，改变了耕作粗放的情况。全省油菜田一般都采取了深翻、多施肥、合理密植、及时灌溉等措施。
    据新华社成都1日电　四川省新都县桂湖人民公社第一耕作区第一生产队种植的一百九十亩零三厘八油菜，总产达九万五千三百七十二斤，平均亩产五百零一斤十五两。这一百九十亩多油菜普遍长得枝大荚多，每株结荚都在一千个以上，子荚挤得密不透风。其中产量最高的一点九五亩，单位产量为六百四十五斤；最低的一点五七亩，亩产四百零八点四斤。全部产量比去年当地平均亩产一百一十三斤，增产将近四倍。
    这一百九十多亩油菜是5月15日开始收获的。参加这次收割、翻打、风筛，过秤的有中共温江地委验收团、温江专区十七个县的副县长、政协副主任，中共新都县委第一书记黄海香，中央农业部及四川省省级机关的一些负责同志，为了进一步核实产量，中共新都县委还专门组成工作组进行复查、丈量田块。（附图片）
