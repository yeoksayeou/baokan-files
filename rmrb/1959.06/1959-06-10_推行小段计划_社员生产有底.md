Implementing Small-Scale Plans: Ensuring Production Certainty for Commune Members

The First Team of the Fourth Production Brigade of the Central Brigade in Zhoupu Commune, Nanhui County, Shanghai, has been implementing bi-monthly small-scale plans. After assigning specific agricultural tasks to specific individuals in specific fields, setting quality standards, deadlines, and work points, they have been ahead of all other teams in the commune in terms of early rice transplanting, cotton sowing, and barley and wheat harvesting during the one and a half months from mid-April to the end of May.

The specific practices of the First Production Team in formulating small-scale plans and implementing the above-mentioned “five fixed targets” responsibility system are as follows: Based on the season, they schedule various agricultural tasks to be done within half a month; set the quality standards to be achieved for these tasks; determine the work points; set the completion time; and divide the commune members into several specialized groups according to their labor strength and technical skills, contracting out various agricultural tasks; work points are also contracted out to the specialized groups. Through careful planning, some tasks are scheduled for sunny days, and some for rainy days, avoiding work stoppages or disrupting the plan due to rain. The masses also consciously implement the "five fixed targets" system. For example, when transplanting rice, everyone brings a ruler to the field to check whether the spacing between plants and rows meets the specified requirements. In the process of formulating and implementing the "five fixed targets" plan, they have consistently implemented the mass line. First, they hold forums with experienced farmers to discuss, and then convene a commune member meeting to discuss, supplement, and revise. The discussion mainly covers three aspects: discussing the season and clarifying the tasks; discussing measures and clarifying the quality; and discussing labor surpluses and shortages, tapping potential, and solving difficulties. Because the commune members know half a month in advance how much work they should do, how many work points they can get, and that more work means more rewards, everyone is highly motivated, quotas are repeatedly exceeded, and the plan is completed two or three days ahead of schedule each time.

    推行小段计划　社员生产有底
    上海市南汇县周浦公社中心大队第四生产队第一小队，实行每半月安排一次小段计划，和农活定人、定田、定质、定完成时间和定工分以后，从4月中旬到5月底的一个半月内，早稻插秧、棉花播种、元麦大麦收割都走在全公社各小队的前面。
    第一生产小队制定小段计划，实行上述“五定”责任制的具体做法，是根据季节排出半月内需做的各种农活；订出这些农活应达到的质量标准；确定工分数；确定完成时间；根据社员劳力强弱、技术高低，分成若干专业组，包干各种农活；工分也包给专业组。专业组经过周密的安排，有些活放在晴天做，有些活放在雨天做，不因天雨窝工或打乱计划。群众也自觉执行“五定”制度，如插秧时每人都带尺下田，检查株距、行距是否符合规格要求。他们在制订和执行“五定”方案的过程中，自始至终都贯彻了群众路线。先开老农座谈会商讨，其后召开社员大会讨论、补充、修正。大致讨论这样三个内容：讨论季节，明确任务；讨论措施，明确质量；讨论劳力余缺，挖掘潜力，解决困难。社员们由于早在半月前，就知道自己该干多少活、可得多少工分、多干还可多得，人人干劲高，定额一再突破，计划每次都提前两三天完成。（宋章名）
