    Visiting the Past and Discussing the Present
    ——Bulgaria Miscellany II
    Ling He
    On June 3rd, we went to visit Plovdiv, the second largest city in Bulgaria.
    After a light rain, the scenery was clear and beautiful. The car sped along the asphalt road. Cherry trees lined the road, laden with fruit. The wide fields were covered with tender yellow wheat and alfalfa dotted with yellow flowers. Wild poppies by the roadside, gracefully nodding in the wind, seemed to be welcoming the distant travelers. Extensive apple and pear orchards were bearing fruit on their branches, and fields of sugar beets and grapes stretched into the distance. There were also broad beans and mint, dense and continuous. What fertile land; this year promises a good harvest.
    We visited a historical museum. The unearthed cultural relics on display were not numerous, but very exquisite. Especially the stone carvings left by the old Roman Empire, which were very delicate. The curator, Zabo Fu, had just returned from a visit to China and accidentally met us at the Moscow airport, traveling on the same plane to Bulgaria. He said that China's historical relics, such as the Longmen Grottoes in Henan, gave him a deep impression. He cherished the box of ancient coins that our country sent to the museum and showed his sincere friendship.
    In the afternoon, we visited the monument to the Russian liberation of Bulgaria on the mountain, and the tall stone statue of the Soviet Red Army liberating the city. Climbing high and looking far, the scenery was pleasant. We also visited a street of old houses more than a hundred years old, and also saw a section of the city wall that was said to be two thousand years old. In front of an ancient castle, a group of middle school students were practicing still life sketching. Their female teacher, Glaza Visujieva, talked to me about having made a portrait for an actor of our country's acrobatic troupe and was very kind to Chinese people. She invited us to her home as guests, but we politely declined. When we were visiting the former residence of a French writer on a high slope, the cold wind was quite chilling. This female painter in her forties or fifties came to talk about her friendship with Chinese people in those years and asked me to write an inscription in her souvenir book. In her actions, I once again saw the Bulgarian people's love for the Chinese people. Especially when she rushed to the car for the third time at another place and gave me two small pieces of pottery, I was even more moved. To her, I was just a very ordinary, unfamiliar foreigner, yet she showed me deep friendship. Why? Because we are socialist brothers and sisters. At night, my mood could not calm down for a long time, and I got a quatrain:
    We meet suddenly at the ancient castle on three mountains, (Note)
    Bathed in the breeze, our hearts connect,
    Holding and giving pottery with a sense of cherishment,
    How profound is our friendship even from a distance.
      [Note: Plovdiv was originally called Trimontium in Roman times, meaning three mountains.]

    访古谈今
    ——保加利亚散记之二
    凌鹤
    6月3日，我们去访问保加利亚的第二大城市普罗夫迪夫。
    微雨初晴，清明绮丽。汽车在柏油路上奔驰。夹道樱桃，累累满树。宽阔的原野，铺满了嫩黄的小麦和点缀着黄花的苜蓿。路旁野生的虞美人，嬝娜多姿地因风点头，似乎在迎迓远来的旅客。成片的苹果林和梨树林结实枝头，甜菜或葡萄的园田向远处伸展。还有蚕豆、薄荷，也是稠密连绵。多么富饶的土地啊，今年定卜丰收。
    我们参观了一个历史博物馆。出土文物陈列不多，但很精彩。尤其是旧罗马帝国遗留的石刻，十分精致。馆长扎博夫刚从中国参观回来，在莫斯科机场偶然相遇，同机来保。他说我国的历史文物如河南龙门石刻，给予他深刻的印象。他对我国送给该馆的一盒古代钱币十分珍重，显示出真诚的友谊。
    下午，在山上参观了俄国解放保加利亚的纪念碑，和苏联红军解放该城的高大的纪念石像。登高远眺，风景宜人。又参观了一条百余年前的旧房屋的街道，还看了一段据说是两千年前的城墙。在一古城堡的前面，一群中学生在习作实物素描，他们的女老师格拉扎·薇苏婕娃，和我谈及曾为我国杂技团的一位演员作过画像，对中国人非常亲切。她邀请我们到她家作客，我们婉谢了。当我们在一高坡上参观法国某作家故居的时候，寒风袭人颇冷，这位四五十岁的女画家又赶来谈着当年与中国人交往的友情，并要我在她的纪念册上题字。我在她的举动中又一次看到保加利亚人对中国人的挚爱。尤其是她第三次在另一处赶到汽车旁，送给我两件小巧的陶器，更使我感动。我对于她不过是一个极平凡的陌生的外国人，然而她对我表示了深切的友谊，为什么呢？因为我们同是社会主义的兄弟姐妹。夜间，心情长久不能平静，得绝句一首：
    三山古堡乍相逢，（注）
    沐浴清风曲意通，
    持赠缶瓶道珍重，
    何如远别谊还浓。
      〔注：普罗夫迪夫在罗马时代原名德里蒙集，三山之义。〕
