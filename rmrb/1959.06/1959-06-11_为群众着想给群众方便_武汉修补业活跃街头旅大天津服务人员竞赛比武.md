To consider the masses and provide convenience

Wuhan's Repair Industry Active in the Streets; Dalian and Tianjin Service Personnel Compete and Demonstrate Skills

This newspaper reports Wuhan's municipal street industries are launching ten major repair services to meet the daily needs of the people. These ten repair services are: water and electricity installation, hardware accessories, sheet metal repair, palm fiber product repair, bicycle repair, bamboo and rattan ware repair, as well as the repair of clothes and socks, old shoes, houses and stoves, and various wooden furniture.

In April of this year, according to the instructions of the municipal and district Party committees, Wuhan's street factories, while producing large quantities of daily necessities, reallocated labor and drew out a portion of workers to specialize in repair services. According to incomplete statistics from the Jianghan District, the district has established 137 various repair service points for daily necessities, with 660 people participating in repair services. Their scope of repair is very broad, basically achieving the goal of repairing whatever the masses need repaired.

The development of street repair services has brought great convenience to the people. Since its establishment in Renhe Street, the water and electricity installation and repair group has made more than 280 house calls to repair electrical wires, switches, light bulbs, and faucets in just a few months. In May, the repair stations on Hualou Street repaired more than 2,000 items of various kinds.

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 10th: Service personnel in various fields in Dalian are enthusiastically launching a socialist competition focused on improving service quality, resulting in a significant improvement in the quality of work in the service industry.

Not long ago, the trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation of Dalian, according to the instructions of the CCP Dalian Municipal Committee, convened a city-wide congress of service personnel from sectors such as cooks, health care workers, childcare workers, hotels, bathhouses, service staff and administrators (such as dormitory managers), cleaning staff, barbers, train attendants, sales clerks, and bank tellers. The congress summarized and exchanged past service experiences, put forward methods for serving production and people's lives more deeply, and established competition conditions, launching competitions between individuals and between collectives by industry.

Since the launch of the competition, the work of the service industry across the city has improved even more. Some restaurants and repair stations that had been merged in the past have now been restored or are in the process of being re-established. Cooks in factories, mines, enterprises, government offices, and schools are actively opening up gardens and engaging in animal husbandry. According to statistics from 60 factories, mines, and enterprises, they are currently raising 6,880 pigs and 10,000 chickens, and the numbers of fish and rabbits are also constantly increasing. With the arrival of summer, health care workers in various factories, mines, and enterprises are actively cooperating with relevant departments to take measures to prevent heatstroke and lower temperatures, and to prevent summer diseases.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th: The more than 2,400 service personnel from the service and repair companies in the Heping District of Tianjin are carrying out a "five goods" competition—good service attitude, good service quality, good cleanliness and hygiene, good business management, and good policy implementation—and are taking many measures to facilitate residents, which have been well received by residents. These service personnel are distributed among 30 trades, including the repair of leather shoes, bicycles, water pipes, electrical appliances, and bamboo and wooden furniture.

In the competition, various industries have taken some measures to facilitate residents. The electrical appliance installation industry has selected some service personnel to take the initiative to go to residents' homes to inspect and repair electrical wires. In just over ten days, they inspected and repaired the electrical wires of more than 15,000 households.

    为群众着想给群众方便
    武汉修补业活跃街头旅大天津服务人员竞赛比武
    本报讯　武汉市街道工业为了满足人民群众日常生活的需要，正开展十大修补业务。这十项修补业务是：水电安装、五金配件、白铁修理、棕品修理、自行车修理、竹篾藤器修理以及衣服袜子、破旧鞋子、房屋炉灶和各种木器家俱的修补。
    今年4月，武汉市各街道工厂根据市、区党委的指示，在大量生产生活日用品的同时，重新安排劳动力，抽出一部分职工专门负责修补业务。据江汉区的不完全统计，全区共设了各种生活用品修补服务点一百三十七处，参加修补业务的达六百六十人。他们修补的范围很广，基本上做到了群众需要修补什么就给修补什么。
    街道修补业务的开展，给人民群众带来了很大的方便。人和街的水电安装修配组成立以后，几个月内就上门修理电线、开关、灯头和水龙头等二百八十多次。花楼街各修补点5月份一个月就修补各种物件二千多件。
    据新华社旅大10日电　旅大市各方面的服务人员热烈展开以提高服务质量为主要内容的社会主义竞赛，使服务行业的工作质量获得显著提高。
    不久前，旅大市的工会、共青团和妇联根据中共旅大市委的指示，召开了全市炊事员、卫生保健员、保育人员、旅馆、浴池等部门的服务员、管理员（宿舍管理员等）、清洁勤杂员、理发员、车务员、营业员和储蓄员等服务人员的竞赛比武大会，总结和交流了过去的服务经验，提出了今后深入群众为生产和人民生活服务的办法，订出了竞赛条件，按行业展开了个人与个人、集体与集体之间的竞赛。
    竞赛开展以来，全市服务行业的工作做得更好了。过去裁并的一些饭馆和修理站，目前已经恢复或者在着手重设。厂矿企业、机关、学校的炊事人员积极开辟园地，兼做饲养工作，据六十个厂矿企业统计，目前已养猪六千八百八十头，养鸡一万只，鱼、兔的数量也都在不断增加。夏季到了，各厂矿企业的保健员正积极配合有关部门采取措施防暑降温，预防夏季病疾。
    据新华社天津10日电　天津市和平区服务修理公司所属各修配服务站的两千四百多名服务人员，开展服务态度好、服务质量好、清洁卫生好、经营管理好、执行政策好的“五好”竞赛，采取许多措施便利居民，受到居民的欢迎。这些服务人员分布在修理皮鞋便鞋、自行车、自来水管、电器、竹木家具等三十个行业中。
    在竞赛中，各行业都采取了一些便利居民的措施。电器安装行业抽出部分服务人员，主动到居民家里去检查修理电线。他们在十几天里就检修了一万五千多户的电线。
