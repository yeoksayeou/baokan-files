Xinhua News Agency, 8th.  Nakajima Kenzo, Director-General of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and famous Japanese commentator, delivered a speech in Beijing today, severely condemning the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of hostility towards China, and once again expressed the strong desire of the Japanese people to strengthen friendship with the Chinese people.

The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries held a lecture this morning, inviting Nakajima Kenzo, who is about to conclude his friendly visit to China, to deliver a speech. In his speech, Nakajima Kenzo condemned the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of hostility towards China. He said that most Japanese people believe that Nobusuke Kishi's approach is wrong. Nobusuke Kishi's hostility towards China is not only unfair to China, but also dangerous to Japan. Nakajima Kenzo emphasized that Japan is in a very dangerous situation. The Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a treaty that provides military bases to the United States. This treaty and the U.S. military bases set up in Japan according to the treaty are aimed at the Soviet Union and China, and it is only natural for the Japanese people to oppose it.

In his speech, Nakajima Kenzo discussed the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy. He cited examples such as the massive struggles waged by the Japanese people to acquit the innocent defendants in the "Mitaka Incident" and the "Matsukawa Incident" and to oppose the Japanese authorities' despicable conspiracy, and to oppose the revision of the "Police Duties Law." In these struggles, many Japanese intellectuals actively participated in rallies and marched and demonstrated shoulder to shoulder with workers for the first time. These struggles in the Japanese cultural circles have opened a new page for the Japanese democratization movement.

Speaking about the issue of Japan-China relations, Nakajima Kenzo said that Nobusuke Kishi's blatant policy of hostility towards China is clear to everyone. To improve Japan-China relations, the Kishi government must be opposed. Some people in Japan believe that the Kishi government will change its policy to improve Japan-China relations. I don't think the Kishi government will change its policy to improve Japan-China relations. In this unfavorable situation, the question is not how to ask the Kishi government to change its policy, but the question now is that the Kishi government should be overthrown. He said that we are not politicians, but we should gather people's opinions and make such appeals.

Nakajima Kenzo said that the movement against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has now flourished, and I believe that after we return to Japan, this movement will flourish even more.

Nakajima Kenzo said that Japan-China relations are not just a matter of Japan-China relations. It is related to Asian and world countries, and it is also about the issue of "East Wind" and "West Wind." In Japan, the struggle between peace-loving forces and adventurous imperialist forces is becoming increasingly fierce. Japan's "East Wind" and "West Wind" are both blowing strongly. The current situation requires the Japanese people to state whether they are on the side of the "East Wind" or the "West Wind." Our answer is that we are on the side of the "East Wind." The center of Japan's "West Wind" is Nobusuke Kishi, and the center of Japan's "East Wind" is the unity of Japanese democratic forces. The most important issue in Japan is the unity of democratic forces. If we unite, the "East Wind" can overwhelm the "West Wind." He pointed out that the Japanese people are working hard, and greater unity of democratic forces has begun to appear.

Nakajima Kenzo finally said that he believes that in the near future, Japan will emerge as a new "East Wind" country, and Japan and China will get along better in friendship. Nakajima Kenzo's remarks received warm applause from the audience.

Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, delivered a speech at the beginning of the lecture, expressing a warm welcome to Nakajima Kenzo and other Japanese friends attending the lecture. He said that the Chinese people, like the Japanese people, are willing to promote the friendship between the people of China and Japan, and are willing to restore normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible.

Yang Hansheng condemned the Nobusuke Kishi government for disregarding the wishes of the people of China and Japan, further following the United States, and adopting an increasingly hostile policy towards China. Yang Hansheng said that the Chinese cultural circles solemnly warn the Nobusuke Kishi government that no rhetoric can deceive the people of China and Japan. The Nobusuke Kishi government must stop implementing its policy of hostility towards China, stop participating in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and stop obstructing the restoration of normal relations between the two countries, otherwise the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations cannot be broken. Yang Hansheng finally said that under the unyielding efforts of the people of China and Japan, the clouds temporarily shrouding Sino-Japanese relations will eventually be dispelled, and the flower of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people will eventually bear fruitful results.

Li Dequan, Ouyang Yuqian, Ma Sicong and other well-known social figures in China and people who have visited Japan attended the lecture. Also present at the lecture were Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji in Beijing and representatives of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and the Japan-China Friendship Association.

    中岛健藏在我对外文协讲演会上说
    要改善日中关系必须反对岸政府
    日本人民正加强团结争取独立、和平和民主
    新华社8日讯　日中文化交流协会理事长、日本著名评论家中岛健藏今天在北京发表讲演，严厉谴责岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，再次表达了日本人民同中国人民加强友好的强烈愿望。
    中国人民对外文化协会今天上午举行讲演会，邀请即将结束在我国友好访问的中岛健藏发表讲演。中岛健藏在讲演中谴责岸信介政府敌视中国的政策。他说，大多数日本人民认为岸信介的做法是错误的，岸信介敌视中国，不仅对不起中国，对日本说来也是危险的。中岛健藏强调指出，日本处于非常危险的境地，日美“安全条约”是向美国提供军事基地的条约。这个条约和按照条约设在日本的美国军事基地是针对着苏联和中国的，日本人民反对它是理所当然的。
    中岛健藏在讲演中论述了日本人民争取独立、和平、民主的斗争。他举例说，为了争取释放“三鹰事件”和“松川事件”的无辜被告以及反对日本当局的卑鄙阴谋手段，为了反对修改“警职法”，日本人民始终进行了规模巨大的斗争。在这些斗争中，日本不少知识分子积极参加集会，并且第一次同工人并肩挺胸地游行示威。日本文化界的这些斗争为日本民主化运动开辟了新的一页。
    讲到日中关系问题时，中岛健藏说，岸信介露骨敌视中国的政策，大家都看得很清楚。要改善日中关系，就必须反对岸信介政府。日本有一部分人认为岸信介政府会改变政策来改善日中关系，我认为，岸信介政府不会改变政策来改善日中关系的。在这种恶劣情况下，问题不是要求岸信介政府如何改变政策，现在的问题是应该打倒岸信介政府。他说，我们不是政治家，但是我们应该把人们的意见集中起来，作这样的呼吁。
    中岛健藏说，现在反对日美
  “安全条约”的运动已经蓬勃发展起来，我相信在我们回到日本之后，这个运动会更加蓬勃发展。
    中岛健藏说，日中关系不仅只是日中关系的问题，它和亚洲和世界各国有关，它也有关于“东风”和“西风”的问题。在日本，爱好和平的力量和冒险的帝国主义势力之间的斗争，是越来越激烈了。日本的“东风”和“西风”都在强烈地刮着。现在的情况要求日本人民说明自己处于“东风”还是“西风”，我们的回答是，我们是站在“东风”一边的。日本的“西风”的中心就是岸信介，日本的“东风”的中心就是日本民主力量的团结。在日本最重要的问题是民主力量的团结，团结起来，“东风”就能压倒“西风”。他指出，日本人民正在努力，民主力量的更大的团结已经开始出现了。
    中岛健藏最后说，相信在不久的将来，日本将作为一个新的“东风”国家而出现，日中两国将会更好地友好相处。中岛健藏的这些讲话获得全场热烈的掌声。
    中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙在讲演会开始时致词，对中岛健藏和出席讲演会的其他日本朋友表示热烈欢迎。他说，中国人民和日本人民一样，是愿意促进中日两国人民的友好，并愿意早日恢复两国的正常关系的。
    阳翰笙谴责岸信介政府不顾中日两国人民的愿望，进一步追随美国，对中国采取变本加厉的敌视政策。阳翰笙说，中国文化界人士正告岸信介政府，任何花言巧语，都不能欺骗中日两国人民，岸信介政府必须停止执行敌视中国的政策，停止参加制造“两个中国”的阴谋，不再阻挠两国正常关系的恢复，否则中日关系的僵局就无法打开。阳翰笙最后说，在中日两国人民不屈不挠的努力下，暂时笼罩在中日关系上的乌云终究要被驱散，中日人民友谊之花，最后必将结出丰硕的果实。
    我国著名社会人士和曾经访问过日本的人士李德全、欧阳予倩、马思聪等出席了讲演会。出席讲演会的还有在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一和日中文化交流协会和日中友好协会的代表。
