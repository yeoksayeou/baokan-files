Rapidly accumulating more and better fertilizer to fully meet the needs of topdressing for rice, cotton, and oil crops, as well as the needs for base fertilizer for summer planting, has become the key to striving for a universal bumper harvest of major autumn crops this year. This is because the sown area of major autumn crops has been universally expanded this year, and the implementation of techniques such as rational close planting has further increased the need for fertilizer, while the existing fertilizer in many places cannot meet the actual needs.

Chemical fertilizers are highly effective and save labor during application. However, according to the current production capacity of the national chemical industry, it is impossible to produce a lot of chemical fertilizer. Imports of chemical fertilizer from abroad will also not be substantial. The most realistic and effective way to solve the fertilizer shortage is still to accumulate farm manure and manufacture local chemical fertilizers.

The sources of farm manure are very broad. Whether in mountainous areas, plains, hills, or coastal and lakeside areas, there are abundant fertilizer sources. Summer is an especially good time to accumulate fertilizer, because vegetation is lush, the temperature is high, rainfall is abundant, and microbial activity is frequent and rapid, which is conducive to the accelerated decomposition of weeds, leaves, and other materials. At the same time, combining this with the summer sanitation campaign, collecting garbage, pit mud, and dirty soil can also produce very good fertilizer. Before the supply of chemical fertilizer in our country can be sufficient, farm manure is the main fertilizer. Some farm manures are even concentrated fertilizers. Green manure, for example, is an organic fertilizer containing relatively rich nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. According to analysis by agricultural science departments: 10,000 catties of better quality green manure compost contains approximately 10 to 30 catties of nitrogen, 6 to 27 catties of phosphorus, and 80 to 100 catties of potassium, which is equivalent to the fertilizer effect of 100 catties of ammonium sulfate, 80 catties of superphosphate, and 160 catties of potassium chloride. Farm manure also has a lasting and stable effect, and can be applied to any crop. Moreover, the application of green manure compost and pen manure and other organic fertilizers can also improve the soil, increase the organic matter in the soil, and enhance water and fertilizer retention capacity. Therefore, even after the supply of chemical fertilizer increases, chemical fertilizer should also be mixed with organically fertilizers collected from farms. The broad masses of Chinese farmers have always had the habit of collecting and using farm manure, and have accumulated diverse methods of accumulating and producing fertilizer. The potential of farm manure is great. Now, we must seize the favorable opportunity of summer fertilizer accumulation and launch a crash campaign to accumulate and produce fertilizer in every possible way.

Since we mainly rely on farm manure at present, accumulating, producing, transporting, and applying fertilizer is very labor-intensive. According to general estimates, fertilizer labor accounts for about 40% of the total agricultural production labor. Now, labor in rural areas is very tight. Therefore, in accumulating and producing fertilizer, we should pay more attention to quality, and not simply pursue quantity. If we only pursue quantity and ignore quality, the quantity may seem large, but the quality is very poor. A lot of labor is used in accumulation and production, and a lot of labor is also used in transporting it to the fields, but the fertilizer effect is not high, resulting in doing twice the work for half the result, and wasting labor. Similarly, when manufacturing local chemical fertilizer, we should also pay attention to quality and effectiveness. We should actively promote anything that has been processed and manufactured, turning substances that cannot be directly used as fertilizer into fertilizer, and improving the effectiveness of things with low effectiveness. Conversely, we should not process or manufacture anything that has not improved the effectiveness or has even caused the original effectiveness to be lost. This is a problem that should be paid special attention to in carrying out the fertilizer accumulation and production campaign under the current situation of tight rural labor. We must pay attention to the quality of fertilizer and strive for effectiveness.

To accumulate and produce more fertilizer, we must mobilize the masses. To mobilize the masses, while strengthening political and ideological work, we must implement more rewards for more fertilizer accumulation in accordance with the principle of distribution according to labor. For collective fertilizer accumulation, work points should be assessed according to quality and quantity, and over-quota rewards should be given for exceeding the quota. For the fertilizer accumulated by individual commune members, prices should be set according to quality grading and paid in cash or assessed as work points. Experience in many places has proven that doing so can further stimulate commune members to actively look for fertilizer sources, improve fertilizer quality, and can also promote commune members to raise more livestock and poultry, accumulate more fertilizer, and develop good habits of persisting in regular fertilizer accumulation. After adopting the above methods, the Qu Yang Brigade of the Bao Feng Commune in Huinong County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, recently accumulated fertilizer that not only met the needs of the team's autumn harvest crops for base fertilizer and spring wheat for topdressing, but also stored more than 5,000 carts, which can be used for two topdressings of more than 500 mu of corn. Before adopting this method, the family fertilizer loss phenomenon in the Hongwen Brigade of the Lintang Commune in You County, Hunan, was relatively serious. After implementing over-quota rewards and fixed-price purchases, the entire brigade built 134 toilets within four days, and pig and cattle pens were also assigned to special personnel, so the fertilizer greatly increased. These are obvious examples.

Summer is a very busy season for agricultural production. To vigorously launch a crash fertilizer accumulation campaign, we must comprehensively arrange labor rationally according to agricultural work. First, it can be combined with summer harvesting and planting, transporting while accumulating fertilizer, and weeding while accumulating fertilizer. Second, it can be carried out by using the gaps between summer harvesting and planting, seizing any opportunity, taking advantage of any available time, accumulating a little during busy periods and a lot during slack periods.

Comrades on the agricultural front must quickly grasp the work of fertilizer accumulation, work enthusiastically and vigorously, meet the needs of base fertilizer for summer planting, prepare more and better topdressing for major autumn crops, and also prepare sufficient base fertilizer for winter planting after the autumn harvest.

    争取秋季丰收的关键
    迅速积聚又多又好的肥料，充分满足水稻、棉花和油料等作物追肥的需要和夏种基肥的需要，这已成为争取今年大秋作物普遍丰产的关键。这是因为今年大秋作物普遍扩大播种面积和进一步贯彻合理密植等技术措施，肥料需要量大大增加，而不少地方现有的肥料不能满足实际需要。
    化学肥料肥效高，施用时也节省劳力。但是，按照国家化学工业现有生产能力，不可能生产很多化学肥料。从国外进口化学肥料，也不会很多。解决肥料不足的最现实最有效的方法还是积制农家肥料和制造土化肥。
    农家肥料的肥源是非常广阔的，不论山区、平原、丘陵地带或者海岸湖滨地区，都有丰富的肥源。夏季积肥尤其有更好的条件，因为夏季草木繁茂，气温较高，雨水较多，微生物活动频繁，繁殖迅速，有利于杂草、树叶等加快腐熟。同时结合夏季清洁卫生运动，搜集一些垃圾、坑泥、脏土等，也能沤出很好的肥料。在我国化学肥料还不能充分供应以前，农家肥料就是主要的肥料。农家肥料中有些肥料还是精肥，像青肥就是含有比较丰富的氮、磷、钾三种肥素的有机肥料。据农业科学部门分析：一万斤较好的青草沤肥中，大约含氮十斤到三十斤，含磷六斤到二十七斤，含钾八十斤到一百斤，也就是相当于一百斤硫酸铵、八十斤过磷酸钙、一百六十斤氯化钾的肥效。农家肥料肥效也持久，肥性也稳定，无论哪种作物都能施用。而且施用青草沤肥和圈肥等有机肥料还能改良土壤，增加土壤中的有机质，增强保水保肥能力。所以，就是在化学肥料的供应增多以后，化学肥料也要与农家收集的有机肥料混合使用。我国广大农民从来就有收集和使用农家肥料的习惯，积累了多种多样的积肥造肥方法。农家肥料的潜力是很大的。现在必须抓住夏季积肥的有利时机，掀起一个千方百计积肥、造肥的突击运动。
    由于目前主要是靠农家肥料，积肥、造肥、送肥和施肥是很费劳动力的。据一般估计，肥料用工占农业生产用工总量的40％左右。现在，农村里劳动力是很紧张的。因此，在积肥、造肥中更应该讲究质量，不能单纯追求数量。单纯追求数量，不注意质量，数量看起来很多，质量很差，积造的时候用工很多，送到地里用工也很多，而肥效不高，事倍功半，浪费了劳动力。同样地，在制造土化肥的时候，也要注意质量，讲究肥效。凡是经过加工制造，把不能直接当做肥料的物质制成肥料的，把肥效低的东西提高了肥效的，都应该积极推广；反之，凡是经过加工制造，并没有提高肥效，甚至使原有的肥效反而受了损失的，就不要去加工制造。这是在当前农村劳动力十分紧张的情况下，在开展积肥造肥运动中尤其要注意的问题。一定要注意肥料的质量，讲求肥效。
    要多积制肥料，必须发动群众。要发动群众，必须在加强政治思想工作的同时，根据按劳分配的原则，实行多积肥多奖励。对集体积肥应该按质按量，评定工分，超过定额的给予超额奖励；对社员个人所积的肥料，实行按质分等论价，现款收购或评工记分。很多地方经验证明，这样做以后，可以进一步激发社员积极寻找肥源，提高肥料质量；还可以推动社员多养家畜家禽，多积肥料，养成坚持经常积肥的良好习惯。宁夏回族自治区惠农县宝丰公社渠羊大队采用上述办法后，最近一个时期所积的肥料不但满足了全队秋收作物所需的基肥和春小麦的追肥，而且还存了五千多车，可供五百多亩玉米施两次追肥。湖南攸县莲塘公社宏文大队在没有采用这种方法之前，家肥流失现象比较严重，实行超额奖励和定价收购以后，全大队四天之内修起了一百三十四个厕所，猪牛栏也有了专人负责，肥料也就大大增加。这些都是明显的例证。
    夏季是农业生产非常紧张的季节，大搞突击积肥运动，必须全面地根据农活，合理安排劳动力。第一，可以结合夏收夏种进行，一面运输一面积肥，一面除草一面积肥；第二，可以利用夏收夏种之间的空隙进行，有空就抓、见缝插针，小忙大积，大忙小积。
    农业战线上的同志们一定要把积肥工作迅速抓起来，热火朝天地大干一番，满足夏种基肥的需要，为大秋作物准备更多更好的追肥，也为秋收以后的冬种准备充足的基肥。
