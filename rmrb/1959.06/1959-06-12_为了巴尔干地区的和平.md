For Peace in the Balkans
    Commentator of this newspaper

    The situation in the Balkans is once again receiving attention from world public opinion today. The Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries are making unremitting efforts to ease tensions in the Balkan region and make the Balkans a peninsula of peace. During his recent visit to Albania at the head of the Soviet party and government delegation, Comrade Khrushchev proposed the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. This proposal was first supported by Albania and warmly welcomed by the people of the Balkan countries and fair-minded public opinion in all countries of the world. The Romanian government’s statement on June 6 and the Bulgarian government’s note to the Greek government on June 9 not only expressed unanimous support for Comrade Khrushchev’s proposal, but also further proposed convening a summit conference of the governments of the Balkan countries and discussing the conclusion of a treaty of mutual non-aggression among the Balkan countries. On June 10, the Soviet government reiterated Comrade Khrushchev’s proposal in its reply to the Italian government. The reply also pointed out that if the countries of the Balkans and the Adriatic Sea region refused to establish missile and nuclear bases on their territories, it would be a great contribution to turning this region into a region of peace.

    Because the imperialist bloc headed by the United States has recently stepped up its preparations for war in the Balkans and the Mediterranean, the situation in this region is deteriorating and causing serious anxiety among the people of all countries. Some time ago, the Italian government, disregarding repeated warnings from the Soviet Union, disregarding the condemnation of fair-minded public opinion in all countries and the firm opposition of its own people, actually agreed to establish American missile and nuclear weapons bases on its territory. Recently, the United States has been negotiating with Greece to establish similar bases on Greek territory. Although the Greek government has stated that it "will not refuse to do anything aimed at promoting the conditions for peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the Balkan countries," it has also openly rejected the proposal to establish a Balkan zone of peace. These actions by the Italian and Greek governments not only fundamentally violate the interests of their own people, but also seriously threaten the peace and security of the Balkans and the Mediterranean, and hinder the normal development of international relations in this region. The purpose of the United States is to turn Italy and Greece into military springboards for its future aggressive wars. Therefore, agreeing to the demands of the United States and willingly acting as a tool of American aggression is tantamount to placing themselves in a position of hostility to the socialist camp countries. And this will not bring any benefit to Italy and Greece themselves, except for a devastating counterattack in the future. Because the Soviet Union and other European socialist countries have stated that the socialist countries threatened by the establishment of American missile and nuclear weapons bases on the territory of neighboring countries cannot ignore this and must take corresponding countermeasures.

    The common interests of the people of the Balkan and Adriatic Sea regions, like the common interests of the people of all countries in the world, are to practice peaceful coexistence and to resolve international issues of common concern through consultation.

    The peace proposals of the Soviet, Romanian, Bulgarian and Albanian governments to make the Balkans a nuclear-weapon-free zone are obviously completely reasonable and feasible. If the Italian and Greek governments can give priority to peace and the interests of their own people, there is no reason or excuse to reject the reasonable proposals of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries of the Balkan Peninsula.

    为了巴尔干地区的和平
    本报评论员
    巴尔干地区的局势今天再一次受到了世界各国舆论的注意。苏联和东欧社会主义国家为了缓和巴尔干地区紧张局势和使巴尔干成为和平半岛，正在进行不懈的努力。赫鲁晓夫同志最近在率领苏联党政代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚的时候，提出了关于在巴尔干和地中海地区建立无原子武器区的建议。这个建议首先得到了阿尔巴尼亚的支持，并受到了巴尔干各国人民和世界各国公正舆论的热烈欢迎。罗马尼亚政府6月6日发表的声明，保加利亚政府6月9日给希腊政府的照会，不但对赫鲁晓夫同志的建议表示一致的支持，并且还进一步提出了召开巴尔干各国政府首脑会议和讨论缔结巴尔干各国互不侵犯条约的主张。6月10日，苏联政府在给意大利政府的复照中，又重申了赫鲁晓夫同志的建议。复照并且指出，如果巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区的国家拒绝在自己领土上建立火箭和原子基地，对于把这一地区变为和平地区将是一个巨大的贡献。
    由于以美国为首的帝国主义集团最近在巴尔干和地中海地区加紧进行备战活动，这一地区的局势正在趋于恶化，并引起了各国人民的严重不安。前些日子，意大利政府不顾苏联的一再警告，不顾各国公正舆论的谴责和本国人民的坚决反对，竟然同意在它的领土上建立美国的火箭和原子武器基地。最近，美国又同希腊进行谈判，要在希腊领土上建立同样的基地。希腊政府虽然表示它“将不拒绝去作旨在促进巴尔干各国人民和平共处的条件的一切事情”，但同时它竟又公然拒绝关于建立巴尔干和平地区的建议。意大利和希腊政府的这种作为，不但根本违反了它们本国人民的利益，而且也严重地威胁了巴尔干和地中海地区的和平与安全，妨碍着这一地区国际关系的正常发展。美国的目的是要把意大利和希腊变成它将来发动侵略战争的军事跳板，因此，同意美国的要求而甘心充当美国的侵略工具，就等于把它们自己也置于同社会主义阵营国家相敌对的地位。而这除了在将来遭到毁灭性的回击以外，决不会给意大利和希腊自己带来任何好处。因为苏联和欧洲其他社会主义国家已经声明，受到在邻近国家领土上建立的美国火箭和原子武器基地威胁的社会主义国家，不能对此置之不理，而要采取相应的对策。
    巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区各国人民的共同利益，同世界各国人民的共同利益一样，是实行和平共处，并且应该用协商的方式来解决共同关心的国际问题。
    苏联、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚政府关于使巴尔干成为无原子武器区的和平建议，显然是完全合理和切实可行的。如果意大利和希腊政府能以和平和它们本国人民的利益为重，就没有任何理由与借口拒绝苏联和罗马尼亚等巴尔干半岛社会主义国家的合理建议。
