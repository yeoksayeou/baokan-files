Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: The finals of the second stage of the 1959 National Deaf Men's Basketball Tournament kicked off today at Beihai Stadium in Beijing. After three intense matches between the six teams participating in the finals, Shanghai, Beijing, and Hubei all emerged victorious. Shanghai defeated Liaoning with a score of 42-32, Beijing defeated Jiangsu with a score of 51-35, and Hubei defeated Guangxi with a score of 70-50.

Six referees officiated each game today. Two referees blew whistles, while four assistant referees used flag signals with eight small flags. During the games, teams used gestures to call "timeouts" and arrange tactics. Each game proceeded very smoothly.

Although the teams participating in the finals were only recently formed, their performance in today's games showed that the players all have good basketball skills. Chen Shengshu, the 20-year-old student captain of the Hubei team, and Li Dehua, a worker player from the Guangxi team, were particularly skilled, with each scoring more than half of their team's points. Chen Shengshu scored a total of 36 points, and Li Dehua scored a total of 26 points.

Today's game between Shanghai and Liaoning was quite tense. Shanghai was the champion of the Nanjing competition zone in the first stage of the preliminary round, and Liaoning was the runner-up of the Shenyang competition zone. After the start of the game, both sides played cautiously, resulting in few points scored. At the end of the first half, Shanghai only led by 16-13. In the second half, the well-coordinated Shanghai team launched frequent fast breaks, widening the score gap and ultimately winning by ten points.

The Beijing team was the champion of the Shenyang competition zone in the first stage of the preliminary round and also the tallest team among the six finalists. The average height of the twelve players on the team is 1.78 meters, with five players ranging in height from 1.80 meters to 1.88 meters. They had an advantage in rebounding under the basket today. In defense, they alternated between "zone defense" and "man-to-man" defense, putting Jiangsu, the runner-up of the Nanjing competition zone, in a passive position.

The Hubei and Guangxi teams were the champion and runner-up of the Wuhan competition zone in the first stage of the preliminary round, and today was their second encounter. In the preliminary round, the Hubei team, known for its fast breaks, defeated Guangxi by a score of 55-45. Today, they played even better and won by twenty points. The Hubei team has the youngest average age of only twenty years old (ten players), while the Guangxi team has the oldest average age of twenty-eight and a half years old (ten players), including two players who are already forty-five years old. However, they still played very bravely, earning praise from the audience.

The finals will continue on the evening of June 15th.

    聋人男子篮球赛揭开战幕
    上海、北京、湖北三个队获胜
    新华社14日讯　1959年全国聋人男子篮球赛第二阶段的比赛——决赛，今天在北京北海体育场揭开战幕，六个参加决赛的聋人男子篮球队进行了三场激战以后，上海、北京和湖北三个队都取得了优胜。上海队以四十二比三十二胜辽宁队，北京队以五十一比三十五胜江苏队；湖北队以七十比五十胜广西队。
    今天的每场比赛，都有六名裁判出场。其中有两名裁判吹哨子，另外四名辅助裁判，拿着八面小旗用旗语示意。比赛过程中，各队“暂停”布置战术，都是用打手势进行的。每场比赛都进行得非常顺利。
    参加决赛的各队虽然都刚组成不久，但从他们今天在比赛中的表现看来，各队队员大都有着良好的篮球技术素养。湖北队队长、二十岁的学生陈圣述和广西队工人选手李德华技术尤为熟练，今天的得分都超过了本队得分的一半。陈圣述共得了三十六分，李德华共得了二十六分。
    今天，上海队同辽宁队的比赛比较紧张。上海队是第一阶段预赛南京竞赛区的冠军，辽宁队是沈阳竞赛区的亚军。比赛开始以后，双方都打得小心翼翼，因此得分都很少，上半场结束时，上海队只以十六比十三领先。下半场，合作密切的上海队屡屡展开快速进攻，这样才使双方比分的距离拉大，最后以十分的优势获胜。
    北京队是第一阶段预赛沈阳竞赛区的冠军，也是参加决赛六个队中队员个子最高的一队，全队十二名队员平均身高是一公尺七十八公分，其中有五名队员身高在一公尺八十公分到一公尺八十八公分之间，他们今天在篮下争球时占了优势，防守时一会儿是“区域联防”，一会儿又是“人盯人”防守，使得南京竞赛区的亚军江苏队经常处于被动地位。
    湖北队和广西队是第一阶段预赛武汉竞赛区的冠、亚军队，今天已是第二次交锋。在预赛时，擅长快攻的湖北队就曾以五十五比四十五赢了广西队十分，今天他们打得更为出色，又赢了广西队二十分。湖北队队员平均年龄最小，只有二十岁（十名队员），而广西队队员平均年龄最大，已达二十八岁半（十名队员），其中有两名队员都已四十五岁，但他们比赛时仍然打得很勇猛，受到观众的称赞。
    这次的决赛将在6月15日晚继续进行。
