Dramas, operas, and song-and-dance programs reflecting the real-world struggles of the Sichuan people and possessing a strong local flavor are continuously increasing in number in the performances of the Chongqing City Drama Troupe and Song and Dance Troupe. Since the beginning of this year, these two troupes have created over twenty new programs.

The drama "Red Flowers Blooming Everywhere" has recently been performed more than thirty times, with every performance sold out. This play is currently undergoing its fifth revision. Through the changes in a store during the Great Leap Forward, it praises the new outlook of commercial work in Chongqing and the noble qualities of commercial workers in serving the people with "bringing convenience to customers and keeping difficulties for themselves." This play is a collective creation by Zhang Ying (deputy head) and Ji Muxian and other actors of the Chongqing City Drama Troupe. The structure of the script is fresh and lively. Before the creation, Zhang Ying, Ji Muxian and more than ten other actors went to the store and worked as shop assistants for more than half a month.

"Red Cloud Cliff," performed by the Chongqing City Song and Dance Troupe, is a story praising the people of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Old Revolutionary Base for their tenacious struggle against reactionary forces. The melody absorbs the style of Sichuan folk music. The new dance program "People's Commune is Good" is based on the rich and beautiful Xiushan Flower Lantern, popular in Xiushan area in eastern Sichuan. This program is performed with singing and dancing, which is very touching.

In order to continuously enrich the cultural and artistic life of the mountain city people, these two troupes are rehearsing dramas and operas such as "Tremendous Changes in the Mountain City," "Steel City War Drums," "Daba Mountain Guerrilla Team," and "Eternal Spring." In order to create the opera "Daba Mountain Guerrilla Team" and song and dance programs with a strong local flavor, the creators of the Chongqing City Song and Dance Troupe went deep into the Daba Mountain area and Xiushan and other places to collect information and materials. The Chongqing City Drama Troupe will soon co-produce its first feature film "This is the Battle" with the Sichuan Emei Film Studio. The author is Sha Ting. This work depicts the story of an old worker growing up in struggle.

    结合现实斗争　地方色彩浓厚
    话剧歌剧并翼双飞
    反映四川人民的现实斗争和具有浓厚地方色彩的话剧、歌剧和歌舞节目，在重庆市话剧团和歌舞团的演出中占的数量不断增多。今年以来，这两个剧团已经创作新节目二十来个。
    话剧“红花朵朵开”最近演出三十多场，场场客满。这出戏现正在作第五次修改。它是通过一个商店在大跃进中的变化，歌颂了重庆市商业工作的新面貌，和商业工作者的“把方便带给顾客，把困难留给自己”的为人民服务的高尚品质。这出戏是重庆市话剧团演员张莺（副团长）和纪慕弦等集体创作的。剧本的结构新鲜活泼。创作之前，张莺、纪慕弦等十多个演员还到商店去做了半个多月的售货员。
    重庆市歌舞团演出的“红云崖”是歌颂川陕老革命根据地人民与反动势力进行顽强斗争的故事。曲调吸收了四川民间音乐的风格。新的舞蹈节目“人民公社好”是根据四川东部秀山一带流行的丰富优美的秀山花灯创编的。这个节目表演起来载歌载舞，十分感人。
    为了不断丰富山城人民的文化艺术生活，这两个剧团正在排演“山城巨变”、“钢城战鼓”、“大巴山游击队”及“万年春”等话剧、歌剧。重庆市歌舞团的创作者们，为了创作好歌剧“大巴山游击队”和具有浓厚地方色彩的歌舞节目，曾经分别深入大巴山地区及秀山等地收集资料和素材。重庆市话剧团即将和四川峨嵋电影制片厂合拍第一部故事片“这就是战斗”。作者沙汀。这部作品是描写一个老工人在斗争里成长的故事。
