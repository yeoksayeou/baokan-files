    Baiyangdian, the "Live Fish Warehouse"
    Baiyangdian is located between Tianjin and Baoding, with a total area of over 500,000 mu, of which more than 270,000 mu are pure water surface. It includes 92 large and small depressions, with abundant aquatic resources and an annual output of more than 10 million jin of fish and shrimp. It is a very good "live fish warehouse."
    This year, in order to strengthen the leadership of aquatic production, Xushui County has appointed one or two secretaries from the county to the commune, management area, and production team to be in charge of aquatic products. At the same time, more than 100 specialized fish farming and fishing teams with 10,000 people participating have been organized for year-round production. In order to rapidly develop aquatic products, the leading departments of this county mobilized the masses to revise unreasonable production quotas and formulate reward methods. The reward method for fishing is daily rewards for daily overproduction, with 70%-80% of the overproduction awarded to the individual, 10%-20% to the production team, and 10% as technical allowance. Additional rewards are also given for catching parent fish and fish fry. Due to the implementation of the principle of distribution according to work and the daily overproduction reward method, the production enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly improved. For example, after the implementation of this method in the Datianzhuang Management Area of Baiyangdian Commune, the daily output increased from more than 2,800 jin to more than 10,000 jin. Before the implementation of the reward method, Ma De, a member of the Datianzhuang commune, only caught 15 jin of fish per day. After the implementation of the reward method, the daily output was 96 jin. In order to further increase production and improve labor productivity, this county has also prominently focused on tool reform and cultivating all-round fishing experts this year, creating more favorable conditions for year-round production. In terms of tool reform, the method of "raising questions and writing articles" is adopted to mobilize the masses to offer suggestions and carry out reforms. At the same time, more than 20 experienced commune members were sent to other places to visit and learn. The fishing tools that have been successfully reformed this year include "large seine nets with pockets," "dam nets with drift nets," as well as "multi-door sealing," "multi-door baskets," and "multi-door cages," etc. According to experiments, the output can be increased by more than double when using these tools for fishing. In terms of cultivating all-rounders, the main methods are to hold spare-time technical training classes in production teams or management areas and to adopt methods such as masters teaching apprentices to impart various advanced fishing techniques.
    Due to the effective strengthening of the leadership of aquatic production, Xushui County caught a total of 5,059,000 jin of fish and shrimp from January to May this year, an increase of nearly double compared with the same period last year. The commodity volume of these fish products accounted for 83%. During this period, more than 4 million jin of commercial fish have been supplied to Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Taiyuan and other places. (Liang Peixi)

    “活鱼仓库”白洋淀
    白洋淀位于天津、保定之间，总面积有五十多万亩，纯水面约二十七万多亩，包括大小九十二个淀，水产资源很多，年产鱼、虾一千多万斤，是一个很好的“活鱼仓库”
    今年徐水县为了加强水区生产的领导，从县到公社，管理区和生产队都确定了一到二名书记专管水产。同时还组织了有一万人参加的一百多个养鱼捕鱼专业队，常年进行生产。为了迅速发展水产，这个县的领导部门发动群众修订了不合理的生产定额和制订了奖励办法。捕鱼的奖励办法是日超产日奖励，以超产部分的70％—80％奖给本人，10％—20％归生产队，10％作技术津贴。捕获亲鱼、鱼种还另给奖励。由于贯彻了按劳分配原则和实行了日超日奖的办法，群众的生产积极性大大提高。如白洋淀公社大田庄管理区在实行这个办法以后，日产量从二千八百多斤增加到一万多斤。大田庄社员马德在没有实行奖励办法以前，每天仅捕鱼十五斤，实行奖励办法以后，每天产鱼九十六斤。为了进一步增加生产，提高劳动生产率，这个县今年还突出地抓住了工具改革和培养捕鱼多面手的工作，为常年生产创造更为有利的条件。在工具改革方面，是采取“出题目、作文章”的办法，发动群众献策献计，进行改革。同时还派出有经验的社员二十多人去外地参观学习。今年已改革成功的捕鱼工具有“大绠带网兜”、“坝网带漂网”，以及“多门密封”、“多门篓”、“多门篮”等等。据试验，用这些工具捕鱼，产量都能提高一倍以上。在培养多面手方面，主要是以生产队或管理区为单位举办业余技术训练班和采取师傅带徒弟等办法，传授各种先进的捕鱼技术。
    由于切实加强了对水产生产的领导，徐水县今年1—5月份共捕捞五百零五万九千斤鱼虾，比去年同期产量增长将近一倍。这些鱼产品的商品量占83％。在这个期间，已有四百多万斤商品鱼，供应北京、天津、保定、太原等地。　（梁培晰）
