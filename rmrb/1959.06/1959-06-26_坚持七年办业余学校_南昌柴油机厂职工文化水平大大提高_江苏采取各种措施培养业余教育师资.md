    Continuing to Run Spare-Time Schools for Seven Years
    Cultural Level of Nanchang Diesel Engine Plant Workers Greatly Improved
    Jiangsu Adopts Various Measures to Train Teachers for Spare-Time Education
    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to raise the cultural level of workers and promote production, the Nanchang Diesel Engine Plant Workers' Spare-Time School has been run very well for seven years.
    During the seven years of teaching, the workers' spare-time school of this factory has adhered to the principle of combining politics, culture, and technology. As a result, the number of students has been increasing, from 200 at the beginning to 2,000, and the number of teachers has increased from 3 to more than 30.
    The Nanchang Diesel Engine Plant has more than 3,000 workers, of whom 35% are illiterate, 40% have elementary school education, and only 25% have junior high school education or above. However, after seven years of hard study at the workers' spare-time school, all illiterate workers in the factory have now been eliminated, more than 200 have reached the level of elementary school and junior high school graduates, and workers with junior high school education or above account for more than 80%, fundamentally changing the situation of low cultural levels. Many workers have improved their culture, and more and more people can read drawings and technical books, which creates favorable conditions for reforming tools, improving operating methods, and absorbing advanced experience. In 1958 alone, workers put forward 200,000 suggestions for technological innovation and wrote many literary works. More than 140 veteran workers have become scientific researchers in the factory.
    The reason why the workers' spare-time education in this factory has been able to persist for seven years is mainly due to four experiences: First, the mass line has been implemented in running the school. During the seven years, the biggest problem encountered was the contradiction between the production time of each workshop and the unified study time. The solution was the workshop-run school proposed by the masses. Workshop-run schools can arrange their own time according to the workshop's operation and production conditions, thus solving the time contradiction between large classes and each workshop; Second, the learning forms are diverse and students are taught according to their aptitude. Veteran workers are mainly taught technical theory and cultural education, with key tutoring; apprentices who have just entered the factory and cannot participate in workshop production are trained centrally; quality inspectors who need a variety of knowledge are taught basic knowledge of various production processes; off-the-job training classes are opened for young technicians and apprentices with certain operating skills; administrative leaders are taught general principles of business management and diesel engine production; Third, adhere to the principle that education serves production. After years of exploration, according to the production characteristics of the factory, the original old courses of junior high school and university were boldly "excavated, supplemented, and touched," and many contents related to diesel engine production were added. This makes the spare-time school a production advisory department. Worker Wan Shenbao, due to learning and applying the principles of physics and mathematics and calculation methods, changed the gantry planer into a gantry milling machine; Xing Guozhen also applied the electrical principles he learned in the trial production of a 20-horsepower automatically controlled high-speed diesel engine, and changed the alarm clock into a time relay; Sun Fuping improved precision measuring instruments and increased work efficiency by 20 times due to his mathematical foundation.

    Xinhua News Agency: Nanjing, Changzhou, Suzhou, Yangzhou and other places in Jiangsu Province are vigorously taking measures to train teachers for workers' spare-time education.
    Since last year, the workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises in Jiangsu Province has made great progress, and the number of students enrolled in many areas has doubled. At the same time, the ranks of full-time and part-time teachers for workers' spare-time education have also been expanded, but the quantity and quality of teachers cannot meet the objective needs. Party organizations in various places have taken many specific measures to solve this difficulty. The main methods are: running spare-time normal schools and worker-teacher refresher courses, etc., to absorb teachers from workers' spare-time schools to participate in learning using a certain amount of time; opening worker-spare-time education teacher rotation training classes, and organizing workers' spare-time school teachers for short-term off-the-job rotation training in a planned way; establishing guidance stations according to regions and professional systems, establishing teaching and research groups, conducting regular business learning, and exchanging teaching experience; adopting the method of master leading apprentice, and full-time teachers guiding part-time teachers in business.
    In the work of training teachers for workers' spare-time schools, many regions are training according to the different characteristics of part-time and full-time teachers, based on the principle of combining current needs with systematic improvement. Since March of this year, Suzhou City has organized 283 full-time teachers with high school degrees or below to participate in the workers' teacher refresher school, divided into five classes: kindergarten teacher, middle school teacher, Chinese language, and mathematics, to systematically improve their cultural knowledge, and also pay attention to explaining the textbooks and teaching methods currently needed. The workers' spare-time normal school run by Yangzhou City has opened two subjects, Chinese and Mathematics, according to the principle of "teach what you learn, learn what you need, and supplement what you lack"; it also uses regular lesson plans, special lectures, and organized teaching observation methods to help part-time teachers improve their business.

### 坚持七年办业余学校  南昌柴油机厂职工文化水平大大提高  江苏采取各种措施培养业余教育师资

    坚持七年办业余学校
    南昌柴油机厂职工文化水平大大提高
    江苏采取各种措施培养业余教育师资
    本报讯　为了提高职工文化水平，推动生产，七年来南昌柴油机厂职工业余学校，办得很出色。
    这个工厂的职工业余学校，在七年的教学过程中，坚持了政治、文化、技术相结合的原则，因而学员的人数一直上升，由开始的二百人发展到两千人，教师由三人增加到三十多人。
    南昌柴油机厂有三千多名职工，其中文盲占35％，高小40％，初中以上仅有25％。但经过职工业余学校七年的苦学，现在全厂职工文盲已全部扫除，达到高小和初中毕业程度的有二百多人，具有初中或初中以上文化程度的职工已占80％以上，根本改变了文化低的面貌。许多工人由于提高了文化，能看图纸、阅读技术书籍的人越来越多，这样就为改革工具，改进操作方法，吸取先进经验等创造了有利条件。仅1958年一年，职工们就提出了二十万条革新技术的建议，写出了许多文艺作品。还有一百四十多名老工人，成为工厂的科学研究员。
    这个工厂的职工业余教育，所以能够坚持七年，主要经验有四条：一、办学贯彻了群众路线。在七年当中，遇到的最大问题，是各个车间的生产时间与统一学习时间的矛盾，解决的办法是群众提出的车间办学。车间办学，可以根据车间作业情况和生产情况自行安排时间，因而解决了上大课与各车间的时间矛盾；二、学习形式多种多样，因人施教。对老工人采取以技术理论和文化教育为主，并重点辅导；对一些刚进厂而不能参加车间生产的徒工，就集中训练；对于需要多种知识的质量检查人员，专授有关各项生产的基本知识；对青年技工和有一定操作能力的徒工，开办了脱产训练班；对于一些行政领导干部，则教以经营管理和柴油机生产的一般原理；三、坚持教育为生产服务的原则。经过多年摸索，根据工厂的生产特点，对原有初中、大学的老课程大胆地进行了“挖、补、摸”，增加了许多与柴油机生产有关的内容。这就使业余学校成了生产参谋部。工人万申宝由于学习并应用了物理和数学原理和计算方法，就把龙门刨床改为龙门铣床；邢国桢在试制二十马力自动控制高速柴油机中，也应用了学到的电学原理，将闹钟改为时间继电器；孙富平由于有了数学基础，改进了精密测量仪器，提高工效二十倍。

    新华社讯　江苏省南京、常州、苏州、扬州等地大力采取措施，培养职工业余教育的师资。
    江苏省各工矿企业的职工教育，去年以来有了很大的发展，许多地区的职工入学人数都成倍地增长。同时，职工业余教育的专职、兼职师资队伍也有所扩大，但是师资的数量和质量都不能满足客观的需要。各地的党组织采取了许多具体的办法解决这个困难。主要的办法是：举办业余师范学校、职工教师进修班等，吸收职工业余学校的教师利用一定时间参加学习；开办职工业余教育师资轮训班，有计划地组织职工业余学校教师短期脱产轮训；按地区、专业系统建立辅导站，成立教研组，定期进行业务学习，交流教学经验等；采取师傅带徒弟的办法，在业务上由专职教师对兼职教师进行辅导。
    在培养职工业余学校教师的工作中，很多地区都按照兼职和专职教师的不同特点，根据目前需要和系统提高相结合的方针进行培训。苏州市今年3月份以来组织了二百八十三名高中程度以下的专职教师参加职工教师进修学校学习，分为幼师、中师、语文、数学等五个班级，系统地提高他们的文化知识，并且也注意讲解当前需要的教材教法。扬州市举办的职工业余师范学校根据“教什么，学什么，缺什么，补什么”的原则，开设了语文、数学两科；对兼职教师还运用定期送教案、举行专题讲座、组织观摩教学等办法，帮助他们提高业务。
