Anshan, June 29th (By our correspondent) - The Anshan Iron and Steel No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace’s entire staff meticulously maintains the furnace body, setting up a red flag for healthy and high production, ensuring a steady increase in steelmaking production. From January to May, this open hearth furnace overfulfilled its production tasks every month. By the 17th of this month, it had completed the first half of the year's national production plan thirteen days ahead of schedule.

The reason this furnace achieved long-term health is that it transformed itself after learning from past lessons. In the fourth quarter of last year, in order to produce more high-quality steel for the country, they adopted measures to increase the charging volume of the open hearth furnace, raising the output per furnace from 150 tons to 191 tons. Although the actual steel output increased by more than 4,000 tons compared to the first quarter, the maintenance work on the furnace body did not keep up in time, the repair time increased, and the steelmaking time decreased. As a result, the effective operation rate of the open hearth furnace decreased by about 7%. Without this unfavorable factor, they could have produced several thousand more tons of high-quality steel.

At the beginning of this year, the entire furnace's staff summed up past experiences, starting with criticizing the idea of neglecting furnace body maintenance and correcting some people's attitudes. For example, Li Tianxi, the furnace chief of shift B, in order to shorten the steelmaking time, disregarded the "thermal engineering" operating procedures and gave too much gas and air, which burned out the back wall, requiring five or six hours of repair. The Party group seized this incident and organized the entire furnace's workers to discuss it. Through the discussion, all the furnace workers received profound ideological education, and they came up with a series of technical measures to maintain the furnace body. In addition, they established a set of furnace body maintenance system, with specific personnel responsible for each part, making furnace body maintenance a regular task. Now, at this open hearth furnace, regardless of the shift or individual, they have developed the habit of regularly blowing the water jacket, blowing the furnace head and furnace roof, and maintaining the furnace body. By mid-March, the furnace roof had been used more than 250 times, and according to the plan, it should have been replaced with a new furnace roof long ago. Because they usually maintained it well, they were supposed to blow it once per shift, but now some shifts blew it twice, and some even blew it three times. It was postponed until early April before they replaced the new furnace roof. Their furnace roof life is twice as long as other furnaces.

Because all the furnace workers worked together to strengthen furnace body maintenance, this furnace not only eliminated unplanned repairs but also reduced one planned repair, increasing effective operating time and producing a large amount of high-quality steel for the country. The effective operation rate of the No. 6 open hearth furnace in the first quarter of this year increased by 8.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, which is equivalent to adding seven working days. At the same time, it also created favorable conditions for further "more charging, faster smelting." The average steel output per furnace in the first quarter also increased by more than eleven tons compared to the fourth quarter of last year, a total of more than 3,700 tons of steel more than the fourth quarter of last year. This Red May, this open hearth furnace went to a higher level, and the operating rate increased by more than 4%. From January to May, it overfulfilled the planned steel output by 4,000 tons in five months, and completed the state-assigned production task for the first half of the year on June 17, ahead of schedule.

People commented: The greater achievement of this furnace lies in proving with facts that only by maintaining the furnace body well can the effective operating rate of the open hearth furnace be improved, ensuring "more charging, faster smelting," and promoting the steady improvement of steelmaking production levels. The leadership of Anshan Iron and Steel is vigorously promoting the experience of the No. 6 open hearth furnace to ensure the steady rise of steelmaking production levels.

Anshan, June 29th (By our correspondent) - Anshan Iron and Steel is vigorously promoting the advanced experience of No. 6 open hearth furnace in maintaining the furnace body, organizing all steelmaking workers to carry out a competition for maintaining the furnace body, planting red flags and setting up pacesetters in the twenty-odd large open hearth furnaces. The operation rate of open hearth furnaces has therefore risen steadily. In the most recent month or so, the repair time of large open hearth furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel has been greatly reduced, and the production time has been significantly increased. The operation rate of open hearth furnaces in May increased by an average of 4.02% compared to April, which is equivalent to adding a new large open hearth furnace. In the first and middle ten days of June, the operating rate of open hearth furnaces increased by another 1.3% compared to May.

Whether the furnace body of the open hearth furnace is well maintained is the key to whether the current steelmaking production of Anshan Iron and Steel can be steadily improved. In April, although the output of steel in Anshan Iron and Steel increased day by day in the battle to seize steel, some cadres and workers only paid attention to "more charging, faster smelting," and relaxed the daily maintenance of the furnace body. The furnace body of the open hearth furnace often had problems, the repair time gradually increased, and the production time gradually decreased, and the operating rate showed a downward trend. In response to this problem, the Party Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel deeply excavated and summarized the experience of the No. 6 open hearth furnace, and in mid-May, organized more than 400 steelmaking workers to learn the advanced experience of the No. 6 open hearth furnace and launched a red flag competition for maintaining the furnace body well.

The operation rate of the five famous large fixed open hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel generally increased by 13.61% in May compared to April, which is equivalent to each open hearth furnace producing four more days. The No. 13 open hearth furnace adopted the method of "smelting wherever it is thin" of the No. 6 furnace. The charging amount increased from 280 tons to 330 tons, and the output of each furnace of steel can increase by about 50 tons. In the past, the steelmaking time of the No. 16 open hearth furnace was as long as thirteen hours. Now they insist on blowing the water jacket, burning the furnace head, and repairing the furnace head, so that the gas and air are unobstructed. The steelmaking time is shortened to about nine hours, and one furnace of steel can be produced for every three or four furnaces of steel.

The leaders of each steelmaking plant, while launching a mass movement to maintain the furnace body, have taken effective measures to regularize the maintenance of the furnace body. The first and second steelmaking plants and five large fixed open hearth furnaces have established more than 20 important systems such as repair furnace quality inspection and regular repair furnace. The first steelmaking plant has incorporated furnace body maintenance as a main content of the red flag competition, and promoted this work step by step through regular organization of inspections and evaluations. The second steelmaking plant has formulated a set of systems, specifying dedicated personnel for maintaining each part of each open hearth furnace, conducting a major inspection and evaluation every week, and immediately organizing relevant personnel to deal with problems found, and announcing the evaluation results to all employees, which promotes the regular maintenance of the furnace body.

While Anshan Iron and Steel is promoting the experience of No. 6 open hearth furnace and mobilizing steelmaking workers to maintain the furnace body well, it is also organizing the workers of the refractory materials factory to improve the quality of refractory bricks, providing strong support for prolonging the life of the furnace body and improving the operating rate.

### 设备维护好　产量步步高  鞍钢推广六号平炉经验开展维护炉体竞赛  五月份平炉作业率比四月份提高4.02％，等于新增一座大型平炉

    设备维护好　产量步步高
    鞍钢推广六号平炉经验开展维护炉体竞赛
    五月份平炉作业率比四月份提高4.02％，等于新增一座大型平炉
    本报鞍山29日电　鞍钢六号平炉全体职工精心维护炉体，竖起了一面健康高产红旗，保证了炼钢生产稳步提高。这座平炉从1月到5月，平均月月超额完成生产任务，到本月17日，已经提前十三天完成了上半年国家生产计划。
    这座炉子所以获得长期健康是接受了过去的教训以后转变过来的。去年第四季度，为了给国家多生产优质钢，他们曾经采取扩大平炉装入量的措施，把每炉产钢量从一百五十吨提高到一百九十一吨后，虽然实际产钢量比第一季度增加了四千多吨，可是由于炉体维护工作没有及时地跟上去，检修时间增加了，炼钢时间减少了，因而平炉的有效作业率却下降了7％左右，如果没有这一不利因素，还能多生产几千吨优质钢。
    今年年初全炉职工通过总结过去的经验，从批判忽视维护炉体的思想入手，端正了一些人的态度。比如乙班炉长李田锡，为了缩短炼钢时间，不顾“热工”操作制度，多给煤气和空气，结果把后墙给烧坏，修理五、六个小时。党小组抓住这件事，组织全炉工人展开讨论，通过讨论全炉工人都受到了深刻的思想教育，从而想各种办法找出了一系列维护炉体的技术措施。另外，他们还建立了一套炉体维护制度，各个部位都有专人负责，使炉体维护工作经常化。现在这座平炉上，不管那个班或那个人，已经养成按时吹扫水套，吹扫炉头和炉顶等，维护好炉体的习惯。到3月中旬，炉顶已经使用了二百五十多次，按计划早就应该换新炉顶了。由于他们平时维护得好，照规定每班要吹扫一次，可是，现在有的班吹扫两次，有的班甚至已吹扫三次，一直推迟到4月上旬，才换了新炉顶，他们的炉顶寿命，比别的炉要长一倍。
    由于全炉职工一齐动手，加强炉体维护，这座炉子不仅消灭了计划以外的检修，还减去了一次计划中的检修，增加了有效作业时间，为国家增产大量优质钢。六号平炉今年第一季度的有效作业率，比去年第四季度提高了8.2％，相当于增加了七个工作日，同时它也为进一步“多装、快炼”创造了有利条件，第一季度平均每炉产钢量，又比去年第四季度增加了十一吨多，共比去年第四季度多炼三千七百多吨钢。今年红5月，这座平炉更上一层楼，作业率又提高了4％多，从1月到5月，五个月超过计划增产钢四千吨，已经在6月17日，提前完成了上半年国家给予的生产任务。
    人们议论：这座炉子更大的成就还在于用事实证明：只有维护好炉体，才能提高平炉的有效作业率，保证“多装、快炼”，促进炼钢生产水平稳步提高。鞍钢领导方面正在大力推广六号平炉的经验，保证炼钢生产水平稳步上升。

    本报鞍山29日电　鞍钢大力推广六号平炉维护炉体的先进经验，组织所有炼钢职工开展维护炉体的竞赛，在二十几座大型平炉中插红旗树标兵，平炉作业率因此节节上升。最近一个多月来，鞍钢的大型平炉，检修时间大大减少，生产时间显著增加。5月份的平炉作业率，平均比4月份提高4.02％。相当于新增加了一座大型平炉。6月上、中两旬，平炉作业率又比5月份提高了1.3％。
    平炉炉体维护得好坏，是当前鞍钢炼钢生产能否稳步提高的关键。4月份，鞍钢在夺钢大战中，钢的产量虽然逐日增加，但是有些干部和工人，只注意“多装、快炼”，放松对炉体的日常维护，平炉的炉体时常出毛病，修炉的时间渐渐增加，生产的时间逐渐减少，作业率出现下降的趋势。鞍钢党委针对这个问题，深入挖掘并总结出六号平炉的经验，在5月中旬组织四百多名炼钢工人，学习六号平炉的先进经验，开展了维护好炉体的红旗竞赛。
    鞍钢著名的五座大型固定式平炉在5月份，作业率普遍比4月份提高13.61％，相当于每座平炉多生产四天。十三号平炉采用了六号炉“那里薄炼那里”的办法，装入量由二百八十吨增加到三百三十吨，每炼一炉钢产量可以增加五十吨左右。十六号平炉过去炼钢时间长达十三个小时，现在他们坚持吹扫水套、烧炉头和补炉头以后，使煤气和空气畅通无阻，炼钢时间缩短到九个小时左右，每炼三四炉钢就能增产一炉钢。
    各炼钢厂的领导上，在开展群众性维护炉体运动的同时，采取有效措施使炉体维护工作经常化。第一、第二炼钢厂和五座大型固定式平炉，已经建立起修炉质量检查、定期修炉等二十多项重要制度。第一炼钢厂把炉体维护工作，作为红旗竞赛的一项主要内容，通过定期组织检查评比，推动了这项工作步步深入。第二炼钢厂更制订了一套制度，每座平炉的各个部位，都规定有专人负责维护，每周大检查、大评比一次，发现问题立即组织有关人员处理，并向全体职工公布评比结果，这就促使炉体维护工作能经常坚持下去。
    鞍钢在推广六号平炉经验，发动炼钢工人维护好炉体的同时，还组织耐火材料厂职工提高耐火砖质量，给延长炉体寿命提高作业率以有力支援。　（王殿学）
