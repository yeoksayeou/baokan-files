Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 24th: The extraordinary flood peaks of the West River and North River converged this morning at Sixianzhou, Sanshui County, fiercely attacking the Pearl River Delta. The flood prevention armies on the West River, North River embankments, and various dikes in the delta are valiantly defending the dikes and engaging in a decisive battle with the flood. As of 7:00 PM, no accidents had occurred on the dikes along the West River and the North River; many dikes in the river network area of the Pearl River Delta have experienced seepage, slope collapse, and other dangerous situations, and some small dikes have breached. The flood-fighting army is currently engaged in rescue efforts.

Due to the confluence of the West River and North River flood peaks, the water level at Sixianzhou, Sanshui County, reached 8.67 meters at 8:00 AM today, exceeding the warning level by 2.7 meters, and 0.57 meters higher than the highest flood level of 8.1 meters in 1956 since liberation. The total flood discharge reached approximately 44,500 cubic meters per second.

The West River flood peak reached Gaoyao at 0:00 today, with a flood peak water level as high as 11.35 meters, exceeding the warning level by 2.35 meters, and 0.38 meters higher than the highest water level of 10.97 meters in 1956 since liberation. The flood discharge was approximately 36,300 cubic meters per second.

The North River flood peak, intensified by heavy rains on the 23rd, reached Qingyuan at 1:00 PM today, with the water level reaching 13.06 meters. It reached Shijiao at 6:00 AM, with the water level reaching 11.11 meters (compared to 11.02 meters yesterday morning). The flood discharge reached approximately 8,200 cubic meters per second, an increase of 560 cubic meters per second compared to 7,640 cubic meters per second yesterday morning.

After the confluence of the West River and North River flood peaks at Sixianzhou, they pressed towards the river network area of the Pearl River Delta from Makou in the southwest and Hekou in the southeast. Coupled with the backing of the South China Sea tide, the largest flood since liberation appeared in the delta area. The flood water levels in downstream counties such as Xinhui, Shunde, and Zhongshan have all exceeded the highest water levels on record. For example, the water level at Sangyuanwei in Fanshun County reached 5.59 meters, 0.05 meters higher than the highest water level of 5.54 meters in 1949 on record; the water level at Chaolianwei in Xinhui County reached 4.10 meters, 0.02 meters higher than the highest water level of 4.08 meters in 1949. The water level at Shakou section within Zhongshan County of the Zhongshun Joint Embankment on the border between Zhongshan and Fanshun counties reached 3.65 meters, 0.08 meters higher than the highest water level of 3.57 meters in 1949.

During this flood peak, the water levels in the upper reaches of the West River and North River were higher than the highest water levels recorded in previous years, while the water levels in Gaoyao in the lower reaches of the West River and Qingyuan in the lower reaches of the North River were lower than the highest water levels recorded in previous years (1949). This is because most of the dikes in and around the Pearl River Delta collapsed that year, creating an invisible flood diversion situation, which relatively lowered the water levels in the downstream of the Pearl River Delta.

After the arrival of the flood peak, the West River and North River dikes underwent severe testing. This morning, when the West River extraordinary flood peak reached Gaoyao City, a section of the Nanmen dike on the west side of the city was only one centimeter away from being submerged; a section of the Baisha dike was washed away; and water leakage occurred at Jingfuwei on the east side of the city, a very critical situation. Under the personal command of Fan Jinbao, Secretary of the Jiangmen Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the party, government, army, and people were united as one, and after arduous struggle, all the dangerous sections have been rescued. Currently, all the dikes on both sides of the West River are safe and sound. To be prepared for any eventuality, the Gaoyao city dike continues to store large quantities of sand and stones, so that a second flood prevention dike can be built immediately if necessary.

As of 7:00 PM, no accidents have occurred on the North River dike, which protects Guangzhou and the eastern part of the Pearl River Delta. Currently, the patrol teams and dike protection teams along the dike are stepping up patrols to protect the dike. In dangerous dike sections such as Hekou, there are 60 to 80 dike protection team members and 20 to 30 patrol team members per kilometer of dike, strengthening vigilance. According to the person in charge of the North River Dike Headquarters, the flood prevention preparations for the North River Dike are sufficient. As long as we continue to be vigilant and closely guarded in these two or three days, the safety of the North River Dike can be ensured.

The large and small dikes in the river network area of the Pearl River Delta have been subjected to the greatest pressure from this flood peak. The flood prevention armies on each dike are now firmly guarding the dikes and fighting the flood, and backup teams have been successively deployed. Most of the dikes were safe and sound as of 5:00 PM, but many dikes also showed signs of leakage and other dangerous situations, and some small dikes breached. The flood-fighting army is currently engaged in rescue efforts. There was a six-zhang slope collapse in the Guzhen section within Zhongshan County of the Zhongshun Great Embankment, and 15,000 people are working overnight to rescue it. A 150-meter section of the Zhabei section of the Sangyuanwei in Fanshun County was only five centimeters away from being submerged by the flood, and more than 300 people are currently rushing to repair and raise it. Muxizhouwei in Xinhui County has been flooded. Chengnanwei, a smaller dike in Gaohe County, breached five meters, and 30,000 people are currently engaged in rescue efforts. After another smaller dike, the Lianhewei, breached, the water was actively released into the enclosure because the rescue was ineffective and the rice had already been harvested, in order to avoid expanding the breach. However, the main dikes in Gaohe County are all holding firm.

Hundreds of thousands of flood-fighting troops in the river network area of the Pearl River Delta are engaged in fierce battles. They are determined to overcome the floods and protect Guangdong's granary.

    广东西江北江大堤正在经历严重考验
    防汛大军同特大洪峰决战
    新华社广州24日电　西江、北江特大洪峰，今天早上在三水县思贤?汇合，猛袭珠江三角洲。在西江、北江堤上和三角洲各个堤围迎击洪水的各路防洪大军，正在英勇地据守着堤围和洪水进行决战。到十九时止，西江两岸堤围和北江大堤没有发生事故；珠江三角洲的河网地区有不少堤围出现渗漏、塌坡等险情，个别小堤围发生决口，抗洪大军正在抢救。
    由于西江和北江洪峰的汇合，三水思贤?今天早上八时水位已涨达八点六七公尺，超过警戒水位二点七公尺，比解放以来1956年的最高洪水位八点一公尺高零点五七公尺、洪水的总流量达四万四千五百秒公方左右。
    西江洪峰在今日零时到达高要，洪峰水位高达一一点三五公尺，超过警戒水位二点三五公尺，比解放以来1956年的最高水位一○点九七公尺高零点三八公尺。洪水流量约为三万六千三百秒公方。
    23日因大雨加强了的北江洪峰，今日一时到达清远，水位达到十三点○六公尺，六时到达石角，水位达到十一点一一公尺（昨晨为十一点○二公尺），洪水流量达八千二百秒公方左右，比昨天早晨的七千六百四十秒公方增大了五百六十秒公方。
    西江和北江的洪峰在思贤?汇合后，即从西南的马口和东南的河口两路压向珠江三角洲水网地区。加上南海大潮的顶托，三角洲一带出现了解放以来的最大洪水，下游的新会、顺德、中山等县，洪水水位都超过了有纪录以来的最高水位。如番顺县桑园围水位高达五点五九公尺，比有纪录以来的1949年的最高水位五点五四公尺高五公分；新会县潮连围水位高达四点一零公尺，比1949年最高水位四点零八公尺高二公分。中山、番顺两县边界的中顺联围中山县境内沙口段水位高达三点六五公尺，比1949年最高水位三点五七公尺高八公分。
    这次洪峰压来时，西江、北江上游的水位比有纪录的历年最高水位为高，而西江下游的高要和北江下游的清远的水位，比有纪录的历年最高水位（1949年）为低。这是因为那年珠江三角洲及其附近的堤围大多崩溃，出现了一种无形中分洪的状况，因而使珠江三角洲下游的水位相对降低。
    洪峰到来以后，西江、北江堤围经历了严重的考验。今日早晨，西江特大洪峰到高要城时，城西面的南门堤，有一段仅差一公分便将漫顶；白沙堤有一段被冲垮；城东面的景福围也发生漏水现象，情况非常危急。在中共江门地委书记樊金保的亲自指挥下，党政军民万众一心，经过艰苦奋战，已把全部险段抢救出来。现在，西江两岸堤围全部安然无恙，为了有备无患，高要城堤围继续储备大批沙石，必要时立刻可筑起第二道防洪堤坝。
    保卫广州和珠江三角洲东部地区的北江大堤到十九时止，没有发生事故。现在，沿堤的巡逻队和护堤队正抓紧巡逻，保卫大堤。在险要的河口等堤段，每一公里的堤围，就有护堤队六十到八十人，巡逻队二十到三十人，加强戒备。据北江大堤总指挥部负责人对记者说，北江大堤的防洪准备充分，只要在这三两天内继续提高警惕，严密戒备，北江大堤将可确保安全。
    珠江三角洲河网地区的大小堤围受到了这次洪峰的最大压力。现在各堤围的防汛大军正坚守堤围，和洪水决战，后备队已陆续开上。大多数堤围到十七时止安然无恙，但是也有不少堤围出现漏水等险象，个别小堤围发生决口，抗洪大军正在抢救。中顺大围中山县境内古镇段有六丈塌坡，一万五千人正在通宵抢救。番顺县桑园围闸北段有一百五十公尺只差五公寸就被洪水漫顶，现有三百多人正在抢修加高。新会县睦洲圩已被洪水侵入。高鹤县较小的城南围决口五公尺，现有三万人正在抢救中：另一较小围堤联合围决口后，因抢救无效，而且稻子已经收完，已主动放水入围，以免扩大决口。但是，高鹤县的主要干堤都在固守中。
    珠江三角洲河网地区数十万抗洪大军，正在进行激烈的战斗，他们决心战胜洪水，保卫广东的粮仓。
