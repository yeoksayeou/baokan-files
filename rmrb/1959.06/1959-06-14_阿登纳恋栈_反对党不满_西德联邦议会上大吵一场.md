Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, June 11th: A fierce argument erupted in the West German Federal Parliament's plenary session today regarding Adenauer's decision to continue serving as Chancellor. It is clear from the speeches of Adenauer and some of his party leaders that Adenauer's about-face is clearly linked to the conspiracy of Western countries, led by the United States, to obstruct and undermine the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference from reaching an agreement.

At the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group meeting on June 5th, Adenauer had already used the "deterioration of the international situation" and the "development" of the Geneva Conference as excuses for his current actions. Today, he further explained that he felt "a great figure was lost on the battlefield against the communist enemy" upon seeing Dulles seriously ill and dying, causing "an irreparable loss." He said: "With Dulles' death and the Geneva Conference approaching a critical juncture, I decided that I must come forward myself to help ensure the continuation of Western policy." Adenauer also read a letter from Dulles to him dated April 8th of this year. In the letter, Dulles expressed "respect" for Adenauer's decision to run as a presidential candidate, but hoped that he would continue to fight for the "cause of freedom."

Krone, Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group, also emphasized that the "decisive reason" for Adenauer's determination to remain Chancellor lay in diplomatic considerations when defending Adenauer's decision.

Another leader of Adenauer's party, the Vice-President of the West German Federal Parliament, Jäger, also openly stated that Adenauer decided to remain Chancellor in order to allow his own policies to continue. He also said very arrogantly: "Adenauer's era has not ended. On the contrary, it has just begun."

Today, the theme of the Federal Parliament's meeting was originally to pass the budget on its third reading, but the debate surrounding Adenauer's decision took up most of the time. Opposition party members launched fierce attacks on Adenauer and his party; some members of Adenauer's party constantly retorted. Speeches were often interrupted by shouting and yelling. The Speaker on the podium had to repeatedly ring the bell to ask everyone to be quiet.

Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer accused Adenauer of wanting to be De Gaulle and wanting to find a prime minister like Debré to act as a machine to carry out his orders. He said that since this could not be done, Adenauer simply decided to remain Prime Minister himself. He criticized Adenauer's attitude as saying "I am the state," "only I am right, I am omnipotent." Ollenhauer also drew attention to the fact that "the White House and the State Department in Washington were not surprised by Adenauer's decision."

### 阿登纳恋栈  反对党不满  西德联邦议会上大吵一场

    阿登纳恋栈  反对党不满
    西德联邦议会上大吵一场
    据新华社波恩11日电　西德联邦议院在今天举行的全体会议上，围绕着阿登纳决定继续担任总理的问题进行了激烈的争吵。从阿登纳和他的党内一些负责人的发言中可以清楚地看出来，阿登纳这次的出尔反尔，同以美国为首的西方国家力图阻挠和破坏日内瓦外长会议达成协议的阴谋活动有明显的联系。
    在基督教民主联盟议会党团6月5日的会议上，阿登纳就曾经把“国际局势恶化”和日内瓦会议的“发展”情况作为他采取目前这一行动的口实。今天，他更进一步解释说，他看到杜勒斯病重而死，感到“在反对共产主义敌人的战场上丧失了一个伟大的人物”，造成了“不可补偿的损失”。他说：“随着杜勒斯的去世和日内瓦会议的临近严重关头，我决定必须自己出面来帮助保证西方政策的继续。”阿登纳在讲话中还朗读了杜勒斯在今年4月8日给他的一封信。信里，杜勒斯表示“尊重”阿登纳关于充当总统候选人的决定，但是希望他仍然能继续为“自由事业”奋斗下去。
    基督教民主联盟议会党团主席克罗内在替阿登纳的决定进行辩解时，也强调说，促使阿登纳决心继续留任总理的“决定性原因”在于外交上的考虑。
    阿登纳党的另一个领导人、西德联邦议院副议长耶格尔也公开说，阿登纳决定留任总理是为了让他自己的政策得以持续下去。他还十分嚣张地说：“阿登纳的时期没有结束。相反正是刚刚开始”。
    今天，联邦议院开会辩论的主题本来是三读通过预算，但是，围绕阿登纳决定进行的争吵占了绝大部分时间。反对党议员们对阿登纳和他的党进行了猛烈抨击；阿登纳党的一些议员也不断反唇相讥。发言时常被鼓嗓和叫骂声打断。主席台上的议长不得不屡次摇铃要求大家安静。
    社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在发言中指责阿登纳想当戴高乐，并且想物色一个像德勃雷那样的总理来充当执行他的命令的机器。他说，由于这一点没有能够作到，阿登纳就索性决定自己留任总理了。他抨击阿登纳的这种态度等于向人说“朕即国家”、“只有我才是正确的，我才是万能的”。奥伦豪尔还提请注意这个事实，即：“在华盛顿的白宫和国务院对阿登纳的决定并不感到意外”。
