Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 27th. Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, spoke on the 26th at a symposium in Dresden of intellectuals and representatives of socialist labor teams.

    Ulbricht said that the communiqué signed by the Soviet and German party and government delegations in the Soviet Union has great national significance for the German people because it clearly points out the path to a peaceful resolution of the German question. At the same time, this document also has international significance because it is conducive to easing international tensions and enhancing friendship among the people of all countries.

    Ulbricht said that the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has achieved some successes. The four countries have recognized that it is no longer possible to discuss the German question without the participation of representatives from both Germanies. The participation of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic in the conference has given German peace-loving people a direct opportunity to speak.

    Ulbricht emphasized that the Bonn government's plan to break up the Geneva Conference had failed. However, he said, it must be determined that Western countries have not yet realistically assessed the situation, and they proposed a recess because of differences among them. The behavior of the West German representatives at the Geneva Conference showed that the monopoly capitalist groups and the Bonn government have no intention of easing international tensions.

    Ulbricht said that although the peace forces in West Germany are still dispersed, they all realize that Adenauer's atomic armaments and revenge policies have entered a dead end and are doomed to failure.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th. According to TASS, Moscow: The Soviet "Pravda" published a commentary on the 27th on the recess of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, saying that the Soviet public believes that the recess of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference must not be used to distort the work done by the foreign ministers, and should not place new obstacles in the path of achieving positive results at the Geneva Conference.

    "Pravda" wrote that West German reactionary newspapers, reflecting the views of the Bonn ruling group, try to use words such as "failure," "threat," and "ultimatum" as much as possible in articles about the Geneva Conference. It seems that the West German ruling group wants to use the recess of the conference to put pressure on Western countries, attempting to make the conference revert to its original state. "Pravda" said that some French newspapers are echoing the old tune of the Bonn newspapers, saying that there is no need to hold negotiations on a peaceful resolution of the German question and the resolution of the West Berlin issue. "Pravda" pointed out that the Soviet delegation has made many efforts to seek solutions acceptable to all parties to resolve the most acute problems in Europe and ensure peace. However, U.S. Secretary of State Herter's speech on June 3 was surprising; this speech was extremely unobjective, and many arguments had the air of the "Cold War." This naturally raises the question: Did the crazy remarks of the Bonn rulers have an effect on Mr. Herter? Of course, it is Mr. Herter's own business to evaluate the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city in his own way. However, the actual situation is that the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a free city is not for the so-called "annexation" of West Berlin, but to eliminate the dangerous situation in West Berlin and protect the interests of the Germans living in West Berlin.

    苏德会谈有助于和平解决德国问题
    “真理报”指责西方利用外长会议休会进行歪曲宣传
    新华社柏林27日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希，26日在德累斯顿举行的知识分子和社会主义劳动队代表的座谈会上发表了讲话。
    乌布利希说，德苏两国党政代表团在苏联签署的公报对德国人民具有巨大的民族意义，因为它明确地指出了和平解决德国问题的道路。同时，这个文件也具有国际意义，因为它有利于缓和国际紧张局势和增进各国人民的友谊。
    乌布利希说，日内瓦外长会议已经取得了某些成就。四国已经承认没有两个德国代表的参加就不可能再对德国问题进行讨论。由于德意志民主共和国代表团的参加会议，使得德国和平人士有了直接发言的机会。
    乌布利希强调指出，波恩政府企图使日内瓦会议破裂的计划遭到了失败。但是，他说，必须断定，西方国家还没能现实地估计形势，他们建议休会，是因为在他们之间有着分歧。西德代表在日内瓦会议上的行为表明，垄断资本集团和波恩政府无意缓和国际紧张局势。
    乌布利希说，虽然西德的和平力量还是分散的，可是他们都认识到阿登纳的原子武装和复仇政策已经进入了死胡同，并且注定要失败的。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”27日就日内瓦外长会议休会发表评论说，苏联公众认为，日内瓦外长会议的休会决不能被用来歪曲外长们所完成的工作，更不应当在使日内瓦会议达成积极结果的道路上布下新的障碍。
    “真理报”写道，反映波恩统治集团观点的西德反动报纸在关于日内瓦会议的文章中，尽量用“失败”、“威胁”、“最后通牒”这样一些字眼。看来，西德统治集团想利用会议的休会来向西方国家施加压力，企图使会议回复到最初的状况。“真理报”说，法国某些报纸在重弹波恩报纸的老调，说什么没有必要就和平解决德国问题和解决西柏林问题举行谈判。“真理报”指出，苏联代表团作了不少努力，来寻求能够为各方接受的解决欧洲最尖锐的问题的办法和保障和平。然而，美国国务卿赫脱在6月3日的发言却令人感到奇怪，这个发言是极不客观的，许多论调具有“冷战”气味。这就自然而然地会产生这样的问题：波恩统治者疯狂的言论是否对赫脱先生起了作用？固然，按照自己的方式来评价苏联关于把西柏林变成非军事化自由城市的建议，是赫脱自己的事情。但是，实际情况却是，苏联关于把西柏林变成自由城市的建议并不是为了所谓“吞并”西柏林，而是为了消除西柏林的危险局势，并且保障生活在西柏林的德国人的利益。
