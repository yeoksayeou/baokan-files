	Busy Wheat Harvest in May
	Sha Yin

	Wheat is yellow and wheat is fragrant,
	Wheat waves roll like the ocean.
	From south to north, hundreds of miles,
	Southern Shanxi is busy with the summer harvest.
	June days, the sickle sings,
	Ten thousand stones of new wheat enter the granary…

The girls sing a joyful wheat harvest song in the Shanxi flower drum tune. The intoxicating south wind rolls in the boundless golden wheat fields. The first summer harvest season after the communization in the Jinan Plain has arrived!

May in southern Shanxi is hot. People say that in May, the sun makes people sweat oil! However, May is the season of particularly busy farming in southern Shanxi. The wheat, watered abundantly, turns yellow in large patches overnight. Whenever this season arrives, the Jinan Plain boils over. People wear the scorching sun, step on the burning ground, wipe away handfuls of sweat, and harvest the fruits of a year's hard work.

This year, the wheat in southern Shanxi grows particularly well. The narrow Jinan Plain, stretching from the Lüliang Mountains in the west to the Zhongtiao Mountains in the east, has become a golden ocean, with rolling wheat waves and fragrant wheat aroma. When the train I was riding on sped through the wheat sea in southern Shanxi, looking down from the window, I saw many black dots floating in the yellow wheat sea, like a flock of black waterbirds swimming on the sun-drenched water. Fellow passengers told me that they were people harvesting.

As the saying goes, "A moment lost in the wheat harvest is a great loss to the silkworm." If the agricultural activities of the four seasons can be compared to battles, then the wheat harvest is the most intense battle experienced by the rural areas of southern Shanxi throughout the year. A village with a thousand acres of wheat, once the wheat turns yellow and the sickle rings, must be completely harvested in three to five days, or seven to eight days at most, and all the wheat must be brought to the threshing ground. The day after arriving in Linfen, I heard comrades from the Rural Work Department of the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China say that the Changwang Management Area of the Fenglingdu People's Commune, which faces Tongguan across the river, had started the wheat harvest. When I rushed there the next day, only a few scattered small patches of wheat fields remained around Changwang Village. People were threshing wheat in the village and on the surrounding threshing grounds. The wilderness became quiet, and the buzzing of the winnowing fans replaced the sound of the harvesters.

I turned back to the Jiaolu Management Area in the north of the Fenglingdu Commune. This area includes ten villages and twenty-one production teams, with more than ten thousand acres of wheat fields. I happened to arrive when the wheat harvest had just started the day before.

The scene was exciting: the wheat harvesters formed a winding line, moving towards the wheat sea, the small sickles and "puzi" (spreading chains) flashing, the sound of rubbing so loud that people had to raise their voices to talk to each other. Occasionally encouraging each other:

	"Those in the back, speed up!"
	"Don't worry, you'll see how powerful we are in a moment!"

An old man with white hair acted as our temporary guide. He was very talkative, and told me, both angrily and happily, that when the wheat harvest team was organized, he had also signed up, but the captain said that he was too old to handle this work and did not let him participate. He said: "I can't sit still, I've lived for seventy-five years, and I've never seen such good wheat, you can't drop a handful of soil, but the captain says I'm too old!" Tan Zhongxian, the director of the management area, who was using the "puzi" to spread the wheat, is a labor model. He dropped the spreading chain to greet me. He told me that today was the first day, and not everyone had come out yet. Tomorrow they would all gather. Although I didn't ask him, he automatically told me: "This wheat is good! In previous years, one person could barely spread fifteen or sixteen acres a day! This year, even with all the effort in the world, it's no more than seven or eight acres. Take the harvester for example," he pointed to the machine rushing in the south, "that's a rocker harvester. This year, even four horses are sweating all over and can't even pull it for one round. It's not that the machine is heavy, it's that the wheat is thick. Later, we decided to use a tractor to pull it, and it's not bad, right?"

Two or three sets of large horse-drawn carts were continuously transporting the newly harvested wheat back. As soon as the carts left, groups of children went there to collect the scattered wheat ears. Later, I learned that these kids were all students in the first and second grades of elementary school and kindergarten children, and they were responsible for the task of "cleaning up the battlefield" during the wheat harvest. The production team gave them a name, called the "Grain Returns Home Group." However, a woman in charge of picking up wheat said to us: "I'm afraid there's nothing to pick up this year. Several dozen people picked up less than ten catties in half a day. This year, we prepared early for the summer harvest, the tools are good, the people are united, we harvest cleanly, load cleanly, and lose very little!"

### 五月麦收忙

    五月麦收忙
    莎荫
    麦子黄来麦子香，
    麦浪滚滚似海洋。
    从南到北几百里呀，
    晋南遍地夏收忙。
    六月天呀镰刀响，
    万石新麦又入仓。……
    姑娘们用晋南的花鼓调唱起了欢乐的麦收歌。醉人的南风在无边的金黄的麦田里打滚。晋南平原上公社化后的第一个夏收季节到了！
    晋南的5月是炎热的。人说，5月天晒得人流油啦！可是，5月却正是晋南农事特别繁忙的季节。齐水水的麦子，一夜工夫就黄下一大片。每当这个季节到来的时候，晋南平原上就沸腾起来了。人们身披着炽烈的阳光，脚踏着烫脚的土地，抹着一把一把的汗水，把辛勤地经营了一年的果实收割回来。
    今年晋南的小麦长得特别好。西起吕梁山，东迄中条山的狭长的晋南平原，已经变成了一片金黄色的海洋，麦浪滚滚，麦香阵阵。当我乘坐的列车在晋南麦海中飞驰前进的时候，从窗口俯视两侧，只见黄色的麦海中，浮动着许多黑点，就像一群黑色的水鸟遨游在阳光普照的水面上。同车的旅客告诉我，那是人们在收割。
    俗话说：“麦收一晌，蚕老一时”。如果可以把一年四季的农事活动比作战斗的话，那麦收就是晋南农村一年四季所经历的战斗中最紧张的一场。一个村千把亩麦，一旦麦黄镰刀响，短则三五天、长则七八天，就要完全收割完，小麦全部登场。到临汾的第二天，就听中共晋南地委农村工作部的同志说，和潼关隔河相望的风陵渡人民公社长旺管理区开镰收麦了。当第二天我匆匆赶到那里的时候，长旺村周围就已经只剩下一些零星的小块麦田了。人们正在村里和村周围的打麦场上碾麦。旷野安静下去了，嗡嗡的扇车响代替了收割机的声音。
    我回头赶往风陵渡公社靠北的焦卢管理区。这里包括十个村二十一个生产队，有一万多亩麦田。我去的时候凑巧碰上头一天开镰收割。
    这个场面是激动人心的：割麦的人们形成了一条曲折的线，在向着麦海蠕动，小镰刀和“扑子”（即撒链）在闪动着，擦擦的响声竟是这样大，使得人们互相说话都不得不提高嗓门。间或互相鼓励着：
    “后边的，加油啦！”
      “别急，等会你就知道我们的厉害啦！”
    一位白发苍苍的老大爷作了我们的临时向导，他很健谈，又像生气又像高兴的给我讲，原来组织麦收队时，他也报了名，队长说他年纪大了，扛不了这活儿，没让他参加。他说：“坐不住啊，活了七十五岁啦，还没见过这么好的麦，撒把土也落不下，可是队长说我老了！”正在用“扑子”撒麦的管理区主任谭忠贤，是个劳动模范。他丢下撒链接待了我。他告诉我，今天是第一天，人还没全出动。明天就集中来了。虽然我没有问他，他却自动地告诉我说：“这麦子好啊！往年，一个人一天怕撒不倒十五、六亩！今年用上吃奶的劲也不过七、八亩，就说收割机吧，”他指着靠南边正在奔腾着的机器说：“那是摇臂收割机，今年哪，四匹马拉得满身披水啦，还拉不到一个来回，不是机器沉，是麦子厚啊，后来我们就决定用拖拉机拖了，还不错吧？”
    二套、三套的大马车正在把刚刚割倒的新麦川流不息的拉回去。大车一走，小孩子们就成群结队地到那里收拾遗留下的零星麦穗。后来才知道，这些小鬼们都是初小一、二年级的学生和幼儿园的孩子，他们担负着麦收中“打扫战场”的任务。生产队给他们起了个名，叫“颗粒还家团”。不过，一位专管拾麦的妇女向我们说：“今年怕拾不下东西，好几十个人半天拾了不到十斤。今年夏收准备早，工具好，人心齐，割得净，装得净，丢失很少了！”
