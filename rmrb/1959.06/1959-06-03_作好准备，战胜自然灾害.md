Prepare Well and Conquer Natural Disasters

Taking effective measures to prevent natural disasters before they occur, and being able to take timely and effective measures to overcome disasters once they occur, is a very important condition for ensuring the continued Great Leap Forward in agriculture and striving for a bumper harvest.

Whether agricultural production can achieve a bumper harvest mainly depends on two conditions: one is to fully utilize the factors in nature that are conducive to crop growth, and the other is to prevent and overcome the factors in nature that are unfavorable to crop growth. The better these two aspects are done, the more guaranteed the bumper harvest will be. In actual work, these two aspects are often combined. This unity is best manifested in the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production, in which any measure includes the meaning of both further developing the favorable factors of nature and preventing the unfavorable factors of nature. For example, the "Water" character has the meaning of fully utilizing water conservancy, as well as preventing drought and flood, and turning water disasters into water benefits. However, promoting positive factors such as large-scale farmland capital construction and overcoming negative factors such as fighting drought and flood are, after all, different struggles and require different measures. Here, we want to focus on the question of how to prevent and overcome natural disasters on the agricultural production front.

China is a vast agricultural country with a large area. In the ten years since the founding of the country, under the correct leadership of the Party, although we have carried out tremendous work and the ability to prevent natural disasters has been greatly enhanced, we still cannot completely prevent the occurrence of natural disasters and eradicate the threat of natural disasters. Therefore, disasters occur every year. According to statistics from relevant departments, the area of crops affected by disasters nationwide each year is at least 30 to 40 million mu, and as much as 100 to 200 million mu. 1958 was a year of unprecedented bumper harvest in China. However, the area of farmland nationwide that was attacked by various natural disasters reached more than 400 million mu, of which more than 100 million mu were affected by disasters, and the disaster situation was also serious. Because it was the Great Leap Forward, a bumper harvest; and also because these disaster-stricken areas did not suffer large-scale disasters due to the nationwide large-scale water conservancy and other farmland capital construction, the disaster-stricken areas were scattered throughout the country and were ignored by people.

Since natural disasters occur every year, in order to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture, we must prevent them every year and prepare to fight against natural disasters every year. We must not relax our vigilance and be careless. On the issue of fighting natural disasters, some people have a fluke mentality, thinking that since the country is so big, disasters may not necessarily happen in their area; or thinking that since they have overcome disasters in the past and have experience, there will definitely be no problems this year, and so on. This kind of thinking is of course extremely harmful. Indeed, disasters may not necessarily happen in your area, but as the saying goes, "Better safe than sorry," what if a disaster does happen in your area? Isn't it better to be prepared? As for having overcome disasters in the past, it does not mean that we can or have already overcome disasters this year. For a true revolutionary, victory is often a stepping stone to striving for new and greater victories, while for another kind of person, victory will be a cup of "intoxicating wine," making him proud and complacent, and finally leading to great failure. The important thing is to have a high degree of vigilance and to have sufficient and complete preparations to overcome possible disasters and difficulties. According to forecasts from meteorological departments and relevant scientific research institutions, relatively serious natural disasters may occur in China this year. In fact, many places across the country have already experienced varying degrees of natural disasters. In the Northeast, North China, and a considerable part of the Southwest, tens of millions of mu of arable land have already shown serious drought conditions. Hebei Province, which was once severely threatened by drought in 1958, has experienced severe drought again this spring, and drought has also occurred in Sichuan Province. In some areas south of the Yangtze River and coastal provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, floods have also occurred. The occurrence of various insect pests is also more frequent than in previous years. According to past experience, excessive drought in spring may be followed by more rain in summer and autumn. All these facts show that the task of the Chinese people to fight against natural disasters this year has not been reduced. We must do our best to prevent the occurrence of all preventable natural disasters and overcome all conquerable natural disasters.

    What effective measures should we take to achieve
  greater victories in the fight against natural disasters?
  The most important and main thing is to make preparations for
  disaster prevention and resistance. Preparation includes both
  ideological and spiritual preparation, as well as
  organizational and material preparation. Premier Zhou pointed out in
  the government work report at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress:
  Serious natural disasters may occur in agriculture, but
  "as long as we are prepared and work hard to overcome them, then
  no difficulties can stop us from achieving victory." The fact is that
  as long as we raise our vigilance, are not complacent, and everyone establishes the
  confidence and determination to overcome disasters, and tenaciously fight against all possible natural disasters,
  under normal circumstances, we can prevent the occurrence of natural disasters and overcome natural disasters;
  in special circumstances, such as encountering particularly large floods or other disasters,
  as long as people actively work hard and fight tenaciously, the disaster situation can definitely be mitigated.
  Not only can many vivid examples be found across the country,
  but also every region and even every county has specific facts and successful experiences in overcoming disasters.
  When mobilizing the masses to organize the masses to prevent and resist disasters,
  cadres at all levels should vividly and deeply publicize to the masses the deeds of overcoming disasters in the local area, outside the area, now and in the past,
  further strengthen people's confidence, and firmly establish the idea that "man will conquer nature."
  And on the basis of further mobilizing the masses,
  restore and improve the disaster prevention and resistance organization,
  and at the same time, according to the characteristics after communization, make arrangements for labor.
  In this way, in normal times, we can do a good job in prevention, so that disasters do not occur or occur less;
  when a disaster occurs, we can quickly and orderly put ourselves into the disaster relief struggle,
  and eliminate the disaster in its initial stage. Doing a good job in material preparation
  is a decisive key to ensuring the victory over natural disasters.
  The biggest natural disasters in agricultural production in our country are floods, droughts and insect pests.
  The current characteristics are that drought has not been alleviated in some places, while floods have occurred in other places.
  From a national perspective, with the arrival of summer, the rainy season has arrived again,
  and the flood season is about to enter. Due to climate reasons, various insect pests have also entered a vigorous breeding season.
  All localities must make material preparations according to the characteristics of the region.
  Flood control projects and flood control materials, water conservancy projects and drainage and irrigation equipment,
  and medicine and machinery for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests must be carefully subjected to a comprehensive and in-depth inspection and repair and replenishment work.
  It should be admitted that due to the busy schedule of other work last winter,
  many flood control projects that should have been repaired annually have not been repaired,
  or although annual repairs have been carried out, they have not yet been completed,
  although great achievements have been made in water conservancy construction through the efforts of last year,
  The designed irrigation area of national water conservancy projects has reached 1 billion mu,
  but some of them cannot function or cannot fully function due to reasons such as "there is a reservoir but no water has been stored" or "there is water in the reservoir but the channels have not been repaired and the land has not been leveled."
  Localities should seize the time and solve these problems as soon as possible.
  For annual repair projects that have not been completed and can be completed, efforts must be organized to complete them;
  if the auxiliary projects (such as channel construction, land leveling, etc.) are completed,
  the auxiliary projects must be completed as soon as possible.
  Flood control materials, drainage and irrigation equipment, and insecticidal medicines and machinery are important materials for preventing drought, fighting floods and eliminating insects,
  and preparations must be made early.

    With the above preparations, with full spiritual preparation,
  organizational preparation and material preparation,
  we will definitely be able to effectively prevent the occurrence of natural disasters,
  effectively overcome possible natural disasters,
  reduce the harm of natural disasters to agricultural production in our country,
  and ensure the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and strive for a greater harvest this year.
  Now that summer has arrived, it is a season when various natural disasters are prone to occur.
  Let us take action immediately to prevent natural disasters and overcome natural disasters.
  Our action slogan is: Raise vigilance, make preparations, and strive to prevent and overcome all natural disasters,
  and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture.

### 作好准备，战胜自然灾害

    作好准备，战胜自然灾害
    自然灾害没有发生的时候，采取有效措施防止灾害，一旦发生，又能及时地采取有效措施战胜灾害，这是保证农业继续大跃进，争取农业大丰收的一个很重要的条件。
    农业生产能不能获得丰收，主要决定于两个条件：一个是充分利用自然界有利于作物生长的因素，一个是防止和战胜自然界不利于作物生长的因素。这两方面的工作做得愈好，丰收就愈有保证。在实际工作中，这两方面的工作常常是结合在一起的。这种统一已经最好地表现在农业生产“八字宪法”中，其中的任何一项措施，都包括既进一步发挥自然界的有利因素，又防止自然界的不利因素两方面的意义。譬如其中的“水”字，既有充分利用水利的意义，又有防旱抗涝、变水害为水利的意义。但是，发扬积极因素如大搞农田基本建设和克服消极因素如抗治旱涝，毕竟是不同的斗争，需要采取不同的措施。在这里，我们想着重谈谈农业生产战线上如何防止并战胜自然灾害问题。
    我国是一个幅员辽阔的农业大国。建国十年来在党的正确领导下，虽然我们已经进行了巨大的工作，防御自然灾害的能力已经大大增强，但是仍不能完全防止自然灾害的发生和根除自然灾害的威胁。所以，年年总是有灾害发生。据有关部门统计，全国范围内每年成灾的作物面积，少时三、四千万亩，多时达一、两亿亩。1958年是我国史无前例的大丰收的一年。但是全国受到各种自然灾害侵袭的农田面积竟达四亿多亩，其中成灾的一亿多亩，灾情也是严重的。因为是大跃进，大丰收；也因为这些受灾区由于全国大搞水利等等农田基本建设，未能大片成灾，成灾地区分散在全国各地，被人们忽视了。
    自然灾害既然年年有，我们为了保证农业大丰收，也就必须年年防，年年准备同自然灾害作斗争。千万不能放松警惕，麻痹大意。在同自然灾害斗争的问题上，有人存在着一种侥幸心理，认为既然国家这样大，灾害不一定发生在自己的地方；或者认为既然过去已经战胜过灾害，有了经验，今年也一定不会有什么问题，如此等等。这种思想当然是极端有害的。的确，灾害不一定发生在你那个地方，但是正如谚语所说：“不怕一万，就怕万一”，如果灾害万一发生在你那个地方怎么办呢？有备无患，岂不更好么？至于过去曾经战胜过灾害，更不等于今年就能够或已经战胜灾害。对于一个真正的革命者，胜利常常是争取新的更大胜利的阶梯，而对于另一种人，胜利反会是一杯“陶醉的美酒”，使得他骄傲自满起来，终于引来大的失败。重要的问题是要有高度的警惕，要有足够的完善的准备，去克服可能发生的灾害和困难。据气象部门和有关的科学研究机关预测，今年我国可能发生比较严重的各种自然灾害。事实上全国已经有不少地方发生了这样那样的程度不同的自然灾害了。东北、华北以及西南相当大片的地区，数以千万亩的耕地已经呈现了严重的旱象。1958年曾经遭受严重旱灾威胁的河北省，今春又出现了严重的旱象，四川省也发生旱象。长江以南和沿海的江苏、浙江等省的部分地区又出现了涝灾。各种虫害的发生又较往年为多。根据历年来的情况，春季过旱夏秋可能多雨。这许多事实都说明，今年我国人民同自然灾害斗争的任务并没有减轻，必须尽力防止一切可能防止的自然灾害的发生，战胜一切可能战
  胜的自然灾害。
      要在同自然灾害作斗争中取得
  更大的胜利，我们应当采取一些什
  么有效的措施呢？最重要最主要的是作好防灾抗害的准备工作。准备工作既包括思想和精神的准备，也包括组织和物资的准备。周总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的政府工作报告中指出：农业上可能发生严重的自然灾害，但是，“只要我们有准备，并且努力去克服，那末，任何困难都不能阻挡我们取得胜利。”事实正是这样，只要我们提高警惕，不麻痹不自满，人人树立起战胜灾害的信心和决心，顽强地同一切可能发生的自然灾害作斗争，在正常情况下，能够预防自然灾害的发生并战胜自然灾害；在特殊情况下，譬如遇到了特大的洪水或其他灾害，只要人们积极努力，顽强斗争，灾情也一定能够减轻。不仅全国可以找出许许多多生动的事例，而且每个地区甚至每个县都有战胜灾害的具体事实和成功经验。各级干部在动员群众组织群众防灾抗害的时候，要生动地和深刻地把本地、外地、现在和过去战胜灾害的事迹向群众作宣传，进一步坚定人们的信心，牢固地树立“人定胜天”的思想。并且在群众进一步发动的基础上，把防灾抗害的组织恢复和健全起来，同时根据公社化以后的特点，作好劳动力的安排。这样，在平时我们就可以作好预防工作，使灾害不发生或少发生；在灾害一旦发生了的时候，又能迅速地有条不紊地投入抗灾斗争，把灾害消灭在发生的初期。作好物资准备工作，是保证战胜自然灾害的一个决定性的关键。我国农业生产上最大的自然灾害是水灾、旱灾和虫灾。当前的特点是一些地方旱象并未解除，而另一些地方水灾又已发生，从全国来说，随着夏季的来临，雨季又已到来，就要进入汛期，各种虫害由于气候的关系也已进入繁殖旺盛季节，各地一定要根据地区的特点作好物资准备工作。要对防汛工程和防汛器材，要对水利工程和排灌设备，要对防治病虫的药械认真进行一次全面深入的检查和修理、补充工作。应该承认，由于去冬其他工作繁忙，很多应该进行岁修的防汛工程没有岁修，或者虽然进行了岁修但至今尚未完工，水利建设经过去年的努力虽然获得了很大成绩，全国水利工程的设计灌溉面积已达十亿亩，但其中有一部分“有库没有蓄上水”或“有库有水而渠道未修好，土地未平整好”等等原因不能发挥作用，或者不能充分发挥作用。这些问题，各地应该抓紧时间，赶快解决。没有完工而又能够完工的岁修工程，一定要组织力量使其完工；已经完工只要把附属工程（如渠道修建、土地平整等）修好就能发挥作用的，一定要尽可能抓紧时机把附属工程做好。防汛器材、排灌设备和灭虫药械是防旱抗涝灭虫的重要物资，一定要早作准备。
    有了以上这些准备工作，有了充分的精神准备、组织准备和物资准备，我们就一定能够有效地防止自然灾害发生，有效的战胜可能发生的自然灾害，把自然灾害给予我国农业生产的危害缩小，保证农业生产的继续大跃进，争取今年的更大丰收。现在已进入夏季，正是各种自然灾害容易发生的季节，让我们立即行动起来，防止自然灾害，战胜自然灾害。我们的行动口号是：提高警惕，作好准备，力争防止和战胜一切自然灾害，确保农业大丰收。
