Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 16th: A dispatch from Khuang: The "Khuang Lao Patriotic News" (formerly translated as "Khuang Lao Patriotic Information") published an article on June 12th, calling on the Lao people to heighten their vigilance and continue their struggle to prevent the Phoui Sananikone government and the American lackeys among Lao officers from launching new conspiracies.

The article exposed the deceptive nature of the Lao authorities' announcement of the so-called cancellation of the "control" order over the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Party and the Committee for the Policy of Peace and Neutrality. The article stated that while announcing the so-called cancellation of the "control" order, the Phoui Sananikone government still dispatched secret agents to surround the residences of the Lao Patriotic Party leaders. Patriots arrested in the past remain in prison and are subjected to cruel abuse. New arrests are still being carried out, especially in the Khuang area, where the Phoui Sananikone government is intensifying its arrest and suppression of the people.

The article refuted the Lao authorities' claim that the "restoration" of the Patriotic Party leaders' freedom was due to its adoption of a "lenient policy." The article pointed out that according to the Geneva Accords and the agreement signed between the Lao government and the Lao Fighting Units, the Lao Patriotic Party has the legal right to conduct political activities. The Lao authorities' "control" of the Patriotic Party leaders, headed by Prince Souphanouvong, is just one of a series of illegal acts by the Lao authorities. The article said that this behavior of the Phoui Sananikone government has aroused immense indignation among the Lao people, and international public opinion has also protested against it. It is under these circumstances that the Phoui Sananikone government had no choice but to announce the so-called cancellation of the order "controlling" the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Party and the Committee for the Policy of Peace and Neutrality. The "Khuang Lao Patriotic News" demanded that the Phoui Sananikone government release all arrested patriots, immediately stop the civil war, stop arresting and suppressing the people, and guarantee the genuine freedom of the members of the Patriotic Party, the Committee for the Policy of Peace and Neutrality, and all patriotic and peace-loving organizations.

    “川圹老挝爱国报”向人民发出号召
    提高警惕　继续斗争
    新华社河内16日电　老挝川圹消息：“川圹老挝爱国报”（前译“川圹老挝爱国者消息报”）6月12日发表文章，号召老挝人民提高警惕，继续斗争，防止培·萨纳尼空政府和老挝军官中的美国走狗发动新的阴谋。
    文章揭露老挝当局宣布所谓取消对老挝爱国党以及拥护和平中立政策委员会的领袖们的“管制”命令的欺骗性质。文章说，培·萨纳尼空政府在宣布所谓取消“管制”命令的同时，却仍然派遣特务包围着老挝爱国党领袖们的住宅，过去被逮捕的爱国者仍然在监禁中，并且遭受残酷的虐待。而新的逮捕还在继续进行，特别是在川圹地区，培·萨纳尼空政府正在变本加厉地逮捕和镇压人民。
    文章驳斥了老挝当局散布的所谓“恢复”爱国党领袖们的自由是由于它采取了“宽大政策”的说法。文章指出，根据日内瓦协议和老挝政府同寮国战斗部队签订的协议，老挝爱国党在法律上有权进行政治活动。老挝当局“管制”以苏发努冯亲王为首的爱国党领袖，只是老挝当局的一系列违法行为之一。文章说，培·萨纳尼空政府的这种行为引起了老挝人民无比的愤慨，国际舆论也纷纷就此提出抗议。正是在这种情况下，培·萨纳尼空政府才不得不宣布所谓取消“管制”老挝爱国党和拥护和平中立政策委员会的领袖们的命令。“川圹老挝爱国报”要求培·萨纳尼空政府释放所有被捕的爱国者，立即停止内战，停止逮捕镇压人民，并且保证爱国党、拥护和平中立政策委员会以及一切爱国和拥护和平的组织的成员的真正自由。
