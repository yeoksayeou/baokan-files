Hometown of Pig Farming
By Our Correspondent Hu Jian

The pigs of the Liusha River People's Commune in Ningxiang County are famous in Hunan. People call Liusha River the "Hometown of Pig Farming."

This commune has more than 12,000 households, all living on both banks of the Liusha River, a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters.

As soon as you enter the village, you see pigsties of pig farms on the hillside, a row connected to a row climbing up the hill. On the grassland, groups of piglets chase each other in play. Water hyacinths, a good pig feed, are greening the pond, blooming with pink flowers. When work ends in the evening, the village is even more lively. Girls carry baskets of green fodder home, commune members take advantage of the remaining sunset to weed and water the feed fields, and some commune members are at home tinkering and repairing pigsties, preparing for pig farming.

I walked towards the tinkling sound and came to the fifth work group of the Liusha River Production Team. Here, 22 of the 30-plus households were repairing pigsties, and the piglets raised by 12 commune members had already been put into the newly built pigsties. The pigsties were readily available, and the commune members found some scrap wood and renovated them in two or three nights, painting them anew to make them look very tidy. While I was visiting, an old woman in her fifties, Grandma Yu, pulled me to see a young sow she was raising. She stroked the plump pig and introduced to me, "Look at this young sow, it can still give birth to a litter of piglets this year, and it will sell for at least a hundred yuan. By autumn, the commune will be making money, the pens will be making money, and it will be more convenient to have money in hand. I'm also planning to get a wife for my youngest son after autumn!" As she spoke, her son happened to come back from the feed field carrying a hoe, and laughter rang from the pigsty.

After saying goodbye to Grandma Yu, Li Changyun, the director of the commune's Animal Husbandry and Aquatic Products Department, who was leading me on the tour, said, "The method of developing pig farming by walking on two legs has given everyone great enthusiasm!" He cited some figures: Only twenty days have passed this month, and the number of pigs in the entire commune has increased by more than 2,000 compared with the end of April, reaching more than 20,000 in total, with an average of more than two pigs per household, and the pigs raised by commune members account for 17.8% of the total number of pigs in the commune. He said, "Now the two legs are just starting to walk! The masses here love to raise sows. In a few months, come and see, sows giving birth to piglets, and piglets giving birth to piglets, everywhere are red, tender, plump piglet groups, so lovable!"

"Was your development of pig farming smooth from the beginning?" I asked.

"No, it couldn't be like that." Director Li recalled that when the policy of developing pig production by walking on two legs was implemented at the beginning of May, some people had concerns, and some cadres did not understand it. The commune Party committee combined the promotion of the policy of developing public and private raising simultaneously, and adopted methods such as accounting, comparison, and recollection to carry out ideological mobilization at all levels. In particular, combined with field visits and comparisons, they focused on studying the interrelationship between pig farming, manure accumulation, and grain production increase, which gave the greatest education to the commune and team cadres. Last year, the Liusha River Production Team raised 24 pigs per household, and the yield of rice per mu was 850 jin; the adjacent Shiba Production Team, with similar farming conditions, raised only a little more than one pig per household. With fewer pigs and less fertilizer, each mu yielded only more than 600 jin. This year, the rice seedlings of these two teams also differed significantly due to different fertilization conditions. Everyone went to the field to see and calculate, and the enthusiasm for pig farming came, and the broad masses saw that the cadres were taking the lead in raising pigs, and their ideological concerns gradually disappeared.

We walked and talked, and soon arrived at the home of Wen Jiankang, the deputy captain of the Lotus Leaf Production Team. Coincidentally, Wen Jiankang had just returned from weeding in the field, and also brought back a basket full of wild feed, which he had picked up while weeding to feed the pigs. He put down the basket and led us to the pigsty. A sow weighing more than 80 jin was already two months pregnant and was sleeping peacefully in the pen.

"Can you complete your work quota by raising pigs?" I asked.

"Yes!" Wen Jiankang replied. In the half-month since his family raised pigs, he has been doing an average of twelve work points a day, but the commune only requires him to do 280 labor work points a month. He said, "It takes work to raise pigs and grow feed. But as long as you plan well and squeeze in time in the morning and evening, raising a pig or two per household won't delay much work." At a cadre meeting held in the commune not long ago, he used the fact that he did not miss work last year by raising pigs to dispel the ideological concerns of many cadres that raising pigs by commune members would affect collective production. Last year, his family raised a sow, gave birth to two litters of piglets, and earned 225 yuan; the couple completed more than 4,100 work points throughout the year, exceeding the work plan. The conclusion of the meeting was: As long as we grasp the commune members' work plan and use more than 80% of the fertilizer from private pig farming for collective production, as long as we strengthen leadership and make proper arrangements, and develop private pig farming in a planned way, it will not only not affect collective production, but will also increase fertilizer and promote collective production. That night, Wen Jiankang went home, repaired the pigsty, and took the lead in raising pigs. Under the leadership of the cadres, within a few days, more than half of the commune members who had the conditions to raise pigs in the entire production team raised pigs.

While carrying out ideological mobilization, the commune adopted the method of developing public and private pig farming undertakings in batches, in stages, and in a planned and proportional manner, and earnestly helped commune members solve some specific difficulties. For example, recently, the entire commune organized 188 carpenters to help commune members repair more than 2,600 pigsties. They allocated more than 780 mu of feed land to the commune members, issued one jin of feed seeds and a portion of concentrated feed for each pig, and also helped the commune members solve the difficulty of insufficient cooking utensils for pigs. When we visited here, we also saw some commune members who did not have all the conditions for raising pigs voluntarily raising pigs together. They called them "joint raising" households. Old man Wen Maoqian and old woman Li Xuemei are both over sixty years old and are both widowed elderly people. In the past, they were "five guarantees" households in the commune. Last year, they jointly raised a pig. Old man Wen was healthy and strong, and was responsible for growing feed and fetching firewood. Old woman Li had cooking tools at home and was a well-known pig raising expert in the township, responsible for cooking swill and feeding the pigs. Last year, they jointly raised a sow and earned more than 260 yuan, dividing more than 100 yuan each, and lived a good life. Recently, they jointly raised another sow. When old man Wen led us to visit, he repeatedly praised his sow: "Lion head, loach tail, gong belly, peach ears, coarse hair, short mouth, this is the good breed of pig in Liusha River! This year's income from pig farming will be no less than last year!"

"The enthusiasm for private pig farming is indeed not small, how about collective pig farming?" I hoped Director Li could introduce it. He said, "The enthusiasm for collective pig farming is also very great." Then he introduced the two forms of collective pig farming currently here: one is a specialized farm, and the other is a canteen pig farm. There are 188 specialized pig farms in the entire commune, and specialized pig farming accounts for about 20% of the total number of pigs raised in the commune. All of the 840-plus canteens in the commune raise pigs. Generally, each canteen has only ten or so households, raising ten or twenty pigs, and canteen pig farming accounts for about 60% of the total number of pigs raised in the commune. Commune members are very interested in canteen pig farming. In April, the pig farming income of the 361 canteens in the entire commune, in addition to solving the oil and salt money for the canteens, also drew a portion of the money to distribute bonuses according to the number of labor work points the commune members did this month. Each 100 work points can be divided into six or seven jiao, and the average commune member can do more than 300 work points a month, and the labor bonus from canteen pig farming alone is more than two yuan; plus the labor wage part, in addition to not having to pay for food, they can also earn five or six yuan.

We came to the second work group canteen of the Liusha River Production Team. This canteen is larger, feeding 99 people in 22 households, raising 31 pigs. In April, they sold 11 piglets and earned nearly 200 yuan. They took out 88 yuan to distribute bonuses according to labor work points, with each 100 work points getting eight jiao. Group leader Wang Weijia said: "Canteen pig farming has many benefits." He said that more than 90 people eat in the canteen, and there are a lot of leftover food scraps and rice soup swill every day. Not raising pigs is a big waste. Moreover, pig farming accumulates fertilizer, which is good for the fields. They have sent more than 60,000 jin of pig manure to the fields this year, solving the difficulty of lacking fertilizer for more than 30 mu of rice fields.

When we visited the first pig farm in the commune, they were installing a cow-drawn feed cutting machine. The farm manager Yu Guozheng told us that now cutting feed manually costs nearly half of the pig farming labor. Once the cow-drawn feed cutting machine is installed, as long as one person stands next to the machine to send feed, three or four hours can cut the feed for all 200-plus pigs in the farm for one day, freeing up at least ten laborers. Their slogan is: "Vigorously carry out tool reform, increase pigs without increasing people." Currently, the number of pigs in the entire farm has increased from 136 in April to 214; and there are more than 50 sows pregnant, continuously giving birth to piglets, which will multiply several times by the end of the year.

The pig purchasing station located opposite the commune's office recently purchased more than 300 pigs in the past three days and is preparing to transfer them out. These pigs are all plump, with the large ones weighing more than 400 jin each. Liu Hankai, the first secretary of the commune party committee, repeatedly urged when saying goodbye: "Come and see again after autumn, we will not be raising two pigs per household here, but seven or eight pigs per household." Here, I saw how great material power the pig raising policy of public and private co-operation has generated among the broad masses!

### 养猪之乡

    养猪之乡
    本报记者　胡坚
    宁乡县流沙河人民公社的猪在湖南是有名的。人们称流沙河是“养猪之乡”。
    这个公社有一万二千多户人家，都住在流沙河两岸，是一个山清水秀的地方。
    一走进村庄，就看到山坡上养猪场的猪舍，一排紧接一排的爬上了山岗。在青草地上，成群的小猪互相追逐游戏。一种养猪好的饲料——水仙花绿满池塘，正盛开着粉红色的花朵。傍晚收工的时候，村庄里更加热闹了，姑娘们提着一篮篮的青饲料回家，社员们趁着落日的余辉在饲料地上锄草浇水，还有社员在家里叮叮当当地修理猪舍，准备养猪。
    我朝着叮叮当当的响声走去，来到流沙河生产队第五作业组。这里三十多户人家有二十二户在修猪舍，有十二户社员养的小猪已经关进了新修好的猪舍，猪舍是现成的，社员们找些废木材，两三个晚上就把它装修好，粉刷一新，显得很整洁。当我正在参观的时候，一位五十多岁的喻家老妈妈拉着我去看她养的一头小母猪。她一边抚摸着滚壮的小猪，一边向我介绍，“你看这只母猪小，今年还能下一窝小猪，少不了要卖百把块钱。到秋后，社里进钱，栏里出钱，手头就更方便了。我还准备秋后给细崽娶个媳妇啦！”说着，正好他的儿子扛着锄头从饲料地回来，笑声就从猪栏边响起来了。
    和喻家老妈妈告别后，领着我参观的公社畜牧水产部部长李昌云说：“用两条腿走路的办法发展生猪，大家劲头可大啦！”他举了一些数字：这个月才过去二十天，全公社存栏猪较4月底增加二千多头，总数达到两万多头，平均每户养猪两头多，社员养猪占全社存栏总数的17.8％。他说：“现在两条腿才开步走啦！我们这里群众都爱养母猪，再过几个月，你来看看，母猪下小猪，小猪又下小猪，到处都是红嫩嫩的滚壮壮的小猪群，真爱煞人啦！”
    “你们发展养猪一开始就很顺利吗？”我问。
    “不，不可能是这样。”李部长回忆5月初开始贯彻生猪生产两条腿走路的方针时，有的群众有顾虑，有些干部思想不通。公社党委会结合宣传公养私养同时发展的政策，采取算账、对比、回忆等办法，层层进行了思想发动。特别是结合田间参观、对比，着重研究了养猪、积肥、增产粮食之间的相互关系，给社、队干部的教育最大。去年流沙河生产队每户养猪二十四头，稻谷亩产八百五十斤；相邻的石坝生产队，耕作条件差不多，每户只养一头多猪，猪少肥少，每亩只收六百多斤。今年这两个队的禾苗，由于施肥情况不同，差别也很显著。大家到田间一看一算，养猪的劲头就来了，广大群众看到干部都带头养猪了，思想顾虑也逐渐消除了。
    我们边走边谈，很快到了荷叶生产队副队长文建康家里。碰巧，文建康刚从田间耘禾回来，还带了一满篮野生饲料，这是他在耘禾除草时顺便捡回来喂猪的。他放下篮子，就领我们到猪栏边。一头八十多斤重的母猪已经怀孕两个月了，安详地睡在栏里。
    “你养猪能完成出工计划么？”我问。
    “能！”文建康回答说。他家里养猪半个月来，平均每天做十二个工分，可是社里只要求他一个月做二百八十个劳动工分。他说：“养猪种饲料是要花工的。但是只要盘算好，早晚挤时间搞一下，一家一户养头把猪，耽误不了多少工夫。”他在不久前社里召开的干部会上，用他去年养猪不误出工的事实，解除了许多干部怕社员养猪影响集体生产的思想顾虑。去年他家养一头母猪，下两窝小猪，收入二百二十五元；俩夫妇全年做四千一百多个工分，超额完成了出工计划。会上的结论是：只要抓紧社员的出工计划和私人养猪80％以上的肥料用到集体生产上去，只要加强领导和妥善安排，有计划地发展私人养猪，不仅不会影响集体生产，反而能增加肥料，推动集体生产。当晚文建康回家就修好猪栏，带头养猪。在干部带动下，几天工夫，全生产队有条件养猪的社员半数以上都养了猪。
    在进行思想发动的同时，这个公社采取分批分期，有计划按比例地发展公私养猪事业，并认真帮助社员解决一些具体困难。比如，最近全公社就组织一百八十八个木工，帮助社员整修好二千六百多间猪舍。划给社员七百八十多亩饲料地，每头猪发给一斤饲料种子和一部分精饲料，还帮助社员解决了煮猪食用具不足的困难。我们在这里参观时，还看到有些养猪条件不完全具备的社员，自愿合伙养猪，他们叫“伙养”户。贫农文茂乾老汉和李雪梅老妈妈都是六十多岁的人，都是孤老人，过去是社里的“五保”户。去年他们合养一头猪，文老汉身体健旺，负责种饲料、弄柴火，李妈妈家里有煮潲工具，又是全乡有名的养猪能手，负责煮潲喂猪。去年他们伙养一头母猪收入二百六十多元，每人分了一百多块钱，生活得很好。最近他们又伙养了一头母猪。文老汉领着我们参观时，连连赞赏自己的母猪好：“狮子头、泥鳅尾、铜锣肚、桃子耳、毛粗嘴短，这就是流沙河的良种猪啦！今年养猪的收入比去年又少不了啦！”
    “私人养猪劲头的确不小，集体养猪怎么样？”我希望李部长介绍一下。他说：“集体养猪劲头也很大。”接着他介绍了目前这里集体养猪的两种形式；一种是专业场，一种是食堂养猪。全社专业养猪场有一百八十八个，专业养猪约占全社养猪总数20％。全社八百四十多个食堂都养了猪，一般每个食堂只有十来户，养猪一二十头，食堂养猪约占全社养猪总数60％。社员对食堂养猪兴趣很大。4月份全社三百六十一个食堂的养猪收入，除了解决食堂的油盐钱外，还抽出一部分钱按社员这个月做的劳动工分多少进行分红。每一百个工分可分六、七角钱，一般社员一个月能做三百多工分，单是食堂养猪劳动分红就有两块多钱；再加上劳动工资部分，除了吃饭不要钱，还能收入五、六元。
    我们来到了流沙河生产队第二作业组食堂。这个食堂较大，二十二户九十九人吃饭，养猪三十一头，4月份出售小猪十一头，收入近两百元。拿出八十八块钱按劳动工分分红，每一百个工分得八角钱。组长王维佳说：“食堂养猪，一举数得，好处很多。”他说，食堂里有九十多个人吃饭，每天有大量的残菜残饭和米汤潲水，不养猪是个很大的浪费。而且养猪积肥，对田里好处大。他们今年已送了六万多斤猪粪下田，解决了三十多亩稻田缺少肥料的困难。
    我们参观公社第一养猪场时，他们正在安装牛拉切料机。场长喻国正告诉我们，现在用人工切饲料，将近要花费养猪用工的一半。牛拉切料机安好了，只要一个人站在机子旁边送饲料，三、四个钟点就可以把全场二百多头猪一天的饲料切好，至少可以腾出十来个劳动力。他们的口号是：“大搞工具改革，增猪不增人。”目前全场生猪已由4月份一百三十六头发展到二百十四头；还有五十多头母猪怀了孕，接连不断地生小猪，到年底能翻好几番。
    设在公社办公处对面的生猪收购站，最近三天中收购了三百多头生猪，正准备外调。这些猪都滚壮，大的有四百多斤一头。公社党委第一书记刘汉凯在送别时再三叮嘱：“秋后你再来看看，我们这里将不是每户养两头猪，而是养七、八头猪了。”在这里，我看到了公私并举的养猪方针，在广大群众中产生了多么伟大的物质力量啊！
