	"Laolaiqing" and Others
	Shi Gao
	According to statistics, "Laolaiqing," the famous high-quality rice variety created by Chen Yongkang, a national rice production model worker, has now been推广(tuī guǎng extended and promoted) to nineteen provinces and cities across the country, and introduced for planting in fifteen countries.
	The origin of this high-quality variety is traced back to an autumn twenty years ago. Chen Yongkang was on his way home from Yangqiao in Songjiang to Chang'an Village when he saw a particularly outstanding rice穗(suì tassel) in someone else's paddy field. The following year, he planted it and compared it with the local widely planted late粳(jīng) Huang variety. After two years of cultivation, in the third year, all his twenty-plus mu of rice were replaced with this variety. Relatives and friends in the neighborhood also came to change their seeds, and "Laolaiqing" spread in this way.
	I made a rough calculation: among the fifty-five "peasant seed selectors (breeders)" introduced in publications from Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, and other three provinces alone, twenty-seven of them, accounting for about 50%, like Chen Yongkang, created new varieties from "seeing a particularly outstanding rice穗(suì tassel)," or a "unique cotton株(zhū stalk)," or even a "large"豆粒(dòu lì soybean).
	This matter gives us a very profound inspiration. Newton's groundbreaking discovery of universal gravitation is said to have come from seeing an apple fall from a tree and thinking, "Why doesn't it fall upwards?" -- Of course, this is just a legend and there is no factual basis. But in the words of literary theorists, isn't this a "reflection of objective reality"? Facts prove that many innovations and creations, unique insights in science and technology, voluminous artistic masterpieces, and explorations of various laws about society and nature, often begin with countless unnoticed and very ordinary phenomena, followed by further deep thinking and continuous research. Those who achieve success in various works are always those who are good at discovering new things (which are always small at first) and who can also work hard to study them.

    “老来青”及其他
    史羔
    据统计，全国水稻丰产模范陈永康同志创造的著名水稻良种“老来青”，现在已推广全国十九个省市，十五个国家引种了。
    这个良种的来历，是在二十年前的一个秋天，陈永康从松江阳桥到长岸村回家的路上，在别人的稻田里看到一个长得特别优异的稻穗，第二年他就进行种植，跟当地普遍栽种的晚粳黄种进行比较，又经过两年培育，到第三年，他自己的二十多亩水稻，全部换用了这个品种。附近亲友也都来换种，“老来青”就这样传开了。
    我做了个粗略的小计：仅江苏、山东、广东等三个省出版介绍的五十五位“农民选（育）种家”里，像陈永康一样，由“看到一个长得特别优异的稻穗”，或一株“特异的棉株”，以至一颗“个儿大”的豆粒，而创造成新品种的，有二十七位，即占50％左右。
    这件事对我们有很深刻的启发。牛顿万有引力这样科学上划时代的发现，传说是他看见苹果从树上落地，想：“为什么不朝天上掉呢？”——当然，传说而已，并无实据。但这用文艺理论家的话来说，不就是“客观真实的反映”吗？事实证明，不少革新创造，科学技术上独树一帜的创见，卷帖浩繁的艺术巨著，以及关于社会，关于大自然的各种规律的探索，往往是这样由无数不为人们注意的十分平凡的现象开始加以进一步深思，和不断钻研出来的。在各种工作中获得成就的，也总是那些善于发现新鲜事物（开初这总是细小的），而又能刻苦钻研的人。
