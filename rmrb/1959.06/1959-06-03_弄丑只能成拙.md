Notes: Jottings

    The reactionary forces in Japan, led by the Liberal Democratic Party, are obviously seeing that their prospects in the House of Councillors election are not good, and are trying every means to deceive the voters. It is already despicable enough that Nobusuke Kishi himself has come forward to use the pretext of solving the problem of Sino-Japanese relations to swindle votes. Even more absurd is the arrangement of an unsightly anti-communist farce in an attempt to attack the prestige of the Japanese Communist Party.
    According to the Japan News Agency, the Japanese reactionaries have instructed the notorious three right-wing clowns, Higo Kyo and others, to run in the Tokyo area election under the fabricated banners of captain and deputy captain of the so-called "International Communist Organization Tokyo 101 Special Agent Agency." In addition to posting deceptive leaflets on the streets, whenever candidates from the Japanese Communist Party and democratic forces came to a place to deliver campaign speeches, they came out to spread absurd propaganda, shamelessly talking nonsense about how the task of their "Special Agent Agency" was to carry out conspiracies in Japan to "establish communist politics," "lead the international communist forces into Japan," and "exile the US Ambassador to Japan," etc. It can be described as extremely vile.
    These clowns and their director think that this will damage the Japanese Communist Party's reputation in the hearts of the Japanese people. But the Japanese people are not idiots, and from this farce they can only see more clearly the ugly face of the Japanese reactionary forces. The efforts of the three clowns can only cause the Kishi Nobusuke group to lose more votes.

    弄丑只能成拙
    以自由民主党为首的日本反动势力显然是看到自己在参议院选举中的前景不妙，想尽办法对选民进行欺骗。岸信介亲自出面到处拿解决日中关系问题的幌子来骗取选票已经是够卑鄙的了，更荒唐的是安排了一出不堪入目的反共丑剧，企图打击日本共产党的威信。
    据日本通讯社报道，日本反动派竟指使臭名远扬的三名右翼小丑肥后享等，打着捏造的什么“国际共产机构东京第一○一特务机关”队长和副队长的招牌，参加东京地区的竞选。他们除了在街头张贴骗人的传单外，每当日共和民主力量的候选人到一个地方发表竞选演讲时，他们就出来散布荒谬的宣传，居然不要脸地胡说什么他们的“特务机关”的任务是为了在日本“确立共产政治”进行阴谋活动，“把国际共产主义势力导进日本”，“放逐驻日美国大使”云云。可谓下流到家了。
    这几名丑角和他们的导演以为这样就能破坏日共在日本人民心中的信誉。但是日本人民并不是白痴，他们从这出滑稽剧中适足以更加看到日本反动势力的丑恶面目。三名小丑所卖的力气只能使岸信介集团丢掉更多选票。
