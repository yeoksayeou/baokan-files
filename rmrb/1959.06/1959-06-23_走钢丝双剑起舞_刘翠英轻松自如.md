Wire-Walking Sword Dance
　　Liu Cuiying is Relaxed and at Ease
After watching the new acrobatics programs "Magician's Wedding," "Toy Store," "Rocker Board Shaping," "Double Person Shaping," and "Ice Skating," the audience praised them, saying that these programs have a novel style.

The most eye-catching of these programs are the "Sword Dance" and "Red Silk Dance" performed on a soft wire. The famous female acrobat Liu Cuiying performs so skillfully and naturally on a wire, as if she were dancing on flat ground. When dancing with swords, she has just defended against the enemy in front, and in just a split second, she turns around and deflects the spears and knives coming from behind. It is very difficult to perform a turning and defending action on a swaying soft wire in the blink of an eye, but Liu Cuiying is so relaxed and at ease. During rehearsals, Liu Cuiying specifically went to the Chengdu Institute of Physical Education to learn sword dance, studying on the ground for more than half a month. As soon as she returned to the rehearsal hall, she fell off when she first practiced the turning and defending action on a wire that was closer to the ground. No one knows how many times she fell, but every time she fell, she started again, and finally mastered the center of balance and the rules. Liu Cuiying is a main performer in the Chongqing Acrobatic Troupe. She has performed wire-walking abroad twice and was very popular with audiences.

"Rocker Board Shaping" and "Double Person Shaping" are performed by children under the age of eighteen or nineteen, and their movements are soft and beautiful. "Magician's Wedding" and "Toy Store" are acrobatic programs with rich storylines and unique humor, making the magic and juggling performances more dramatic.

### 走钢丝双剑起舞  刘翠英轻松自如

    走钢丝双剑起舞
    刘翠英轻松自如
    看了杂技“魔术师的婚礼”、“玩具商店”、“晃板造型”、“双人造型”及“蹓冰”等新节目以后，观众们都纷纷赞扬说：这些节目的风格新颖。
    这些节目中最引人注意的是：在软钢丝上表演“剑舞”和“红绸舞”。著名杂技女演员刘翠英，在一根钢丝上，表演得那样熟练自然，好像她就是在平地上舞蹈一样。舞剑时，她刚刚防御了前面的敌人，又在短短的一秒钟之内，回转身来拨开从后面刺来的枪刀。在这一眨眼的功夫内，要在晃荡不定的软钢丝上表演回身抵御的动作是很困难的，但刘翠英却是那样轻松自如。刘翠英在排练时，曾经专门跑到成都体育学院去学习剑舞，在平地学了半个多月。等她一回到排练场，刚走上离地面较低的钢丝上练习回身抵御这个动作时，就摔下来了。也不知道她摔掉过多少次，但是她每次都是掉下去了，又重新再来，最后终于掌握了平衡的重心与规律。刘翠英是重庆市杂技团的一个主要演员。她曾经两次出国表演钢丝都深受观众们的欢迎。
    “晃板造型”和“双人造型”都是十八、九岁以下的孩子们演出的，动作柔软、美观。“魔术师的婚礼”和“玩具商店”是带有丰富故事情节而别有风趣的杂技节目，它使得魔术和杂耍的杂技演出富于戏剧性了。
