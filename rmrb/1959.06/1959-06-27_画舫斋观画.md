Viewing Paintings at the Painted Boat Studio
    Lao She

    The "Fifth Capital National Painting Exhibition," sponsored by the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association, has opened at Beihai Park's Painted Boat Studio.

    This exhibition has some distinctive features:

    First, although the exhibition is sponsored by the National Painting Research Association, the works on display are not limited to those of the association's members. This is different from the methods of previous exhibitions and deserves praise. This proves that after the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification campaign, the members are not only well-united but also pay attention to contacting painters and painting learners outside the association; since they share the same interests, they should all be one family. If this continues, the Research Association will gradually strengthen its role in promoting the development of national painting. Opening the door to run the association is definitely better than closing the door!

    Second, because the exhibition method is different from before, this time we can see the works of master painters as well as amateur works by workers, farmers, and students, and works by young painters in their teens and old masters in their eighties are displayed together. We have seen new forces emerge. In addition, we can also see the works of painters who have not painted for a long time. The strength of the painting world is indeed stronger.

    Third, we also see that experts such as Wu Zuoren, who are good at Western painting, also exhibited national paintings. Obviously, the old habit of painters disdaining each other is disappearing. How gratifying this is! Looking closely at the exhibited national paintings, we can see that many of them are also influenced by "Western methods" and no longer stick to one style. Yes, learning from each other will produce new painting methods. In my opinion, this is not only a matter of mutual learning in skills, but also a manifestation of painters wanting to better serve the people through painting. Originally, both Chinese and Western methods have their limitations. Only by mastering multiple techniques can one be skillful and fully express the ever-changing atmosphere of the new society. Those who are not satisfied with their own skills will demand to enrich themselves as much as possible, "accepting everything," and bringing forth new ideas. This exhibition demonstrates the painters' demands.

    Fourth, the exhibited works include "Spring in the Capital," a collaboration by six painters including Hui Xiaotong, which is fourteen yards long. This large painting has attracted attention and sparked debate. Some people say: the quality of a painting does not depend on its size but on its essence. If it is a masterpiece, even if it is only a foot in size, it is enough to be immortal, and there is no need for it to be many yards long. This is reasonable, and I am not prepared to argue on behalf of the six painters. I only want to discuss the matter as it stands and talk about the advantages of this giant painting. Without the Great Leap Forward of the whole people, there would be no such a large painting. It was not produced by chance. There is nothing wrong with striving to leap forward, although the leap forward in painting is not entirely determined by the size of the painting. The enthusiasm and boldness of these six painters are admirable. Without the experience of landscape painting innovation in recent years, this large painting would not have been possible. Long scrolls of city life are rare. With the experience of recent years, they dared to paint mountains, rivers, people, new buildings, new means of transportation, factories and villages, parks and reservoirs in one picture. It can be said that this painting is a preliminary summary of the innovative attempts of landscape painters in the capital in recent years. – Preliminary, because there are still many problems that have not been satisfactorily resolved. Of course, painting a painting that is not so large can also express the experimental experience of the past few years and also discover problems, but the leaping ambition of the painters made them decide to paint a panorama of the capital, and the panorama of the capital does not seem to be accommodated by a painting of one or two feet. The six painters love the capital, and it took them seven months to complete this huge painting. As a citizen of Beijing, I would like to sincerely pay my respects and thanks to the six painters! This large painting is quite troublesome to exhibit and takes up too much space. Some people worry: if every work is several yards long, how can exhibitions be held in the future? This is an overreaction, because these painters did not advocate that paintings must be fourteen yards long to meet the standards in the future. I know that rather than being satisfied with their own achievements, they are more satisfied with the many problems of landscape painting innovation that can be discovered in this painting. In this way, it doesn’t matter if it takes up too much space and is a little troublesome this time, right?

    Let's just talk about the four points listed above, because it's always better for outsiders to say less. There are many good paintings, please go and see for yourselves.

    画舫斋观画
    老舍
    北京中国国画研究会主办的“首都第五届国画展览”已在北海画舫斋开幕。
    这次展览有些特点：
    一，展览虽由国画研究会主办，但展出的并不限于该会会员的作品。这与前几届展览的办法不同，值得称赞。这证明在反右、整风之后，会员们不但团结得好，而且注意到联系会外的画家与绘画学习者；既有同好，便都该是一家人嘛。这么办下去，研究会便能逐渐加强发展国画事业的推动力量。开开大门办会一定比关上大门办会强的多！
    二，因为展览的办法与前不同，所以这次我们能够看见画师的作品与工、农、学生们的业余习作、十来岁的小画家与八十多岁的老手的作品，共列齐陈。我们看到了新生力量。此外，我们还能看到久已不作画的画家的作品。画界的力量的确更强了。
    三，我们还看到，吴作人等擅长西画的专家也展出了国画。显然，画家们彼此相轻的旧习正在消逝。这多么可喜！再细看看展出的国画中，可以看出有不少幅也受了“西法”的影响，不再专守一格。是的，彼此学习，就会产生新的画法。据我看，这还不仅是在技巧上互相学习的问题，而也是画家们想要在绘画上更好地为人民服务的一种表现。本来嘛，中法也好，西法也好，各有局限。只有掌握了多面的技法，才能得心应手，充分表达新社会日新月异的气象。不以一技之长而自满的必会要求尽量充实自己，“昆乱不挡”，推陈出新。这次展览表现了画家们的这种要求。
    四，展出的作品有惠孝同等六位画家合作的“首都之春”，长十四丈。这幅大画引起了注意，也引起了争论。有人说：画不在大而在精。若是精品，虽一尺大小，亦足不朽，无须长达多少丈。这话说的有理，我不预备代六位画家出来驳辩。我只愿就事论事，说说这幅巨画的好处。没有全民大跃进，也不会有这张大画。它不是偶然产生的。争相跃进，并无过错，虽然绘画的跃进不尽决定于画幅的大小。这六位画家的热情与气魄是可钦佩的。没有近几年来山水画革新的经验，也无从产生这张大画。画城市生活的长卷并不多见。有了几年来的经验，他们才会放胆把山水、人物、新建筑物、新交通工具、工厂与农村、公园与水库都画入一幅图中。可以说：这幅画是近几年来首都的山水画家革新尝试的初步总结。——初步，因为里面还有许多未能满意解决了的问题。当然，画一幅不这么大的画也能表现过去几年的尝试经验，也能发现问题，可是几位画家的跃进雄心使他们决定要画首都全景，而首都全景似乎还不是一尺或二尺的画幅所能容纳的。六位画家是热爱首都的，他们费了七个月的时间才画成这幅巨图。以一个北京市民来说，我愿衷心地向六位画家致敬致谢！这张大画展览起来相当麻烦，占地方太大。有人耽心思：假若每幅作品都长达若干丈，以后可怎么举办展览呢？这是多虑，因为这几位画家并没倡议：以后作画非十四丈长即不合规格。我知道，与其说他们满意于自己的成绩，倒不如说他们满意于这张画里可以发现许多山水画革新的问题。这样，这回它占地方太多，麻烦一些，也无所不可吧？
    只说上列的四点吧，因为外行话总以少说为是。好画甚多，请大家自己去看吧。
