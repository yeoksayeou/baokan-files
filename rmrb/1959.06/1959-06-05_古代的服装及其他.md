Ancient Clothing and Other Things
Liu Mianzhi

In feudal society, just like today, everyone had to wear clothes. However, there was one difference: the material, color, and ornamentation of clothing were extremely important and could not be worn casually. Violating the rules could lead to beheading, even the death of the entire family. It turned out that in those days, clothing also indicated class status.

In terms of material, silk, satin, brocade, embroidery, gauze, and damask were exclusively used by the ruling class, while common people could only wear cloth. Thus, "cloth clothing" became a synonym for common people. Some dynasties even specifically prohibited wealthy merchants from using these materials, even if they could afford them.

In terms of color, dyes such as bright red, goose yellow, purple, and green were produced in small quantities domestically and had to be imported from Southeast Asia, making them very expensive. Because of the limited quantity, high price, and attractive colors, these colors were also monopolized by the ruling class. The emperor wore yellow robes, the highest-ranking officials wore bright red and purple, lower-ranking officials wore green, and servants wore black. As for the common people, they could only wear white. Thus, "white clothing" also became a synonym for common people.

As for ornamentation, the embroidery or weaving of dragons, phoenixes, lions, unicorns, pythons, cranes, and various other birds on robes was also specifically stipulated according to the status and rank of nobles and officials. Common people were not allowed to embroider even a small insect or fish, let alone draw dragons and paint phoenixes. Not only that, but there were also extremely strict rules within the ruling class. For example, dragon robes could only be worn by the emperor, and clothing embroidered with phoenixes could only be worn by the empress. Even the highest-ranking officials would be committing the crime of "usurpation" and "high treason" if they wore such clothing, which was punishable by death.

During the Northern Song Dynasty, there was a high-ranking official who was very capable and trusted by the emperor. Once, after drinking a little too much, he carelessly wore a yellow garment and was reported, almost causing a catastrophe.

The Ming Emperor Taizu killed many meritorious officials, and one of the charges against some who had achieved great military feats was the usurpation of dragon and phoenix patterns on their clothing.

Originally, nobles, officials, and common people all had eyes and noses, and yellow skin and black hair. How could one distinguish between the noble and the lowly at a glance? The only way to differentiate was to use the material, color, and ornamentation of clothing to create symbols of rank and status. In particular, officials generally had animal patterns embroidered on the front of their official robes, with birds for civil officials and beasts for military officials. Furthermore, the specific bird or beast used for each rank was strictly regulated, without any ambiguity. In this way, without looking at their faces, one could tell the status of a noble or the rank of an official simply by looking at the color and ornamentation of their clothing. Of course, in addition to clothing, there were also hats and boots, such as the emperor's flat-topped crown, the empress's and noblewomen's phoenix coronets, officials' gauze hats and court boots, as well as the purple-gold fish pouches worn on the body or the feathers on the hat, the decorations on carriages, the decorations on sedan chairs, the number of people carrying the sedan chair, and the height of the houses, the number of rooms, and the type of tiles used, and so on.

In Beijing, many old buildings, mainly the Forbidden City, are covered with yellow glazed tiles, aren't they? Only the emperor could live in such houses, or the deceased emperors, such as in the Temple of Emperors. Gods and Buddhas were also given preferential treatment, such as the Hall of the Heavenly Kings in Beihai Park, which also used glazed tiles, but in mixed colors.

To ensure exclusive rights, historical records of each dynasty had specialized records like the "Treatise on Carriages and Clothing," and there were also specialized provisions in the law.

People of different classes were required to wear different clothing, live in different houses, and use different means of transportation, with absolutely no misuse allowed. Following the regulations was called being in accordance with the rites, while violating them was a crime. Being in accordance with the rites meant maintaining feudal order. However, there were exceptions, such as when the ruling class's control weakened, wealthy merchants would break the rules, wear fancy clothes, imitate the attire of the court and official families, or simply buy official titles with money, wearing the clothing of officials and parading through the streets. As for after peasant uprisings broke out, the rebels simply didn't care about any of this, wearing whatever they wanted, which went without saying.

Today, these have all become historical relics. Palaces, mansions, and the residences of high-ranking officials can still be seen, but their nature has changed. For example, the Forbidden City and the Hall of Heavenly Kings have become museums, and the Temple of Emperors has been turned into a middle school, becoming places for the general public to visit and learn. As for clothing, in addition to seeing some in museums, people can also see them on the stage.

    古代的服装及其他
    刘勉之
    在封建社会里，也和今天一样，人人都要穿衣裳。但是，有一点不同，衣裳的质料、颜色、花饰有极大讲究，不能随便穿，违反了制度，就会杀头，甚至一家子都得陪着死。原来那时候，衣裳也是表示阶级身份的。
    以质料而论，绸、缎、锦、绣、绡、绮等等都是统治阶级专用的，平民百姓只能穿布衣。以此，布衣就成为平民百姓的代名词了，有些朝代还特地规定，做买卖的有钱人，即使买得起，也禁止着用这些材料。
    以颜色而论，大红、鹅黄、紫、绿等染料国内产量少，得从南洋等地进口，价格很贵。数量少，价钱贵，色彩好看，这样，连色彩也被统治阶级专利了。皇帝穿黄袍，最高级的官员穿大红，大紫，以下的官员穿绿，皂隶穿黑。至于平民百姓，就只好穿白了，以此，“白衣”也成为平民百姓的代名词。
    至于花饰，在袍子上刺绣或者织成龙、凤、狮子、麒麟、蟒、仙鹤、各种各样的鸟等等，也是按贵族、官僚的地位和等级分别规定的。平民百姓连绣一条小虫儿小鱼儿也不行，更不用说描龙画凤了。不但如此，在统治阶级内部，也有极大讲究，例如龙袍，只有皇帝才能穿，绣着凤的服装，只有皇后才配穿，即便是最大的官僚如穿这样的服装，就犯“僣用”、“大逆不道”的罪恶，非死不可。
    北宋时有一个大官僚，很能办事，也得到皇帝信任。有一次多喝了一点酒，不检点穿件黄衣服，被人看见告发，几乎闯了大祸。
    明太祖杀了很多功臣，其中有几个战功很大的，被处死的罪状之一是僭用龙凤服饰。
    本来，贵族、官僚和平民都一样长着眼睛鼻子，一样黄脸皮，黑头发，一眼看去，如何能分出贵贱来？唯一区别的办法是用衣裳的质料，色彩，花饰，构成等级地位的标识，特别是花饰，官员一般在官服的前胸绣上动物图案，文官用鸟，武官用兽，其中又按品级分别规定那一级用什么鸟什么兽，是一点也不能含糊的。这样，不用看面貌，一看衣裳的颜色和花饰就知道是什么地位的贵族，什么等级的官员了。当然，衬配着衣裳的还有帽子，靴子，例如皇帝的平天冠，皇后和贵族妇女的凤冠，官员的纱帽、朝靴，以及身上佩带的紫金鱼袋或者帽上的翎毛，坐的车饰，轿子的装饰和抬轿的人数，和住的房子的高度，间数多少，用什么瓦之类等等。
    在北京，许多旧建筑，主要是故宫，不是都盖的是黄琉璃瓦吗？这种房子只有皇帝才能住，再不，就是死去的皇帝，例如帝王庙。神佛也被优待，像北海的天王殿也用琉璃瓦，不过是杂色的。
    为了确保专用的权利，历代史书上都有舆服志这一类的专门纪录，在法律上也有专门的条款。
    各个阶级的人们规定穿用不同的服装，住不同的房子，使用不同的交通工具，绝对不许乱用。遵守规定的叫合于礼制，反之就是犯法。合于礼制的意思，就是维护封建秩序。但是，也有例外，例如在统治阶级控制力量削弱的时候，富商大贾突破规定，乱穿衣裳，模仿宫廷和官僚家庭打扮，或者索性拿钱买官爵，穿着品官服装，招摇过市。至于农民起义战争暴发后，起义的人们根本不管这一套，爱穿什么就穿什么，那就更不用说了。
    今天这些都已经成为历史上的陈迹了。宫殿、王府、大官僚的邸第还可以看到，只是已经变了性质，例如故宫和天王殿都成为博物馆，帝王庙办了中学，成为人民大众游览和学习的场所了。至于服装，除了在博物馆可以看到一些以外，人们还可在舞台上看到。
