The Guolin People's Commune in Huailai County lies along the south bank of the Sanggan River, in the "Field of Zhuolu" where the Yellow Emperor fought Chiyou. Since ancient times, the area beyond the Great Wall has been described as a desolate place. According to the Baoan Cenzhi and Huailai County Chronicles, this area suffered constant droughts, plagues, locust plagues, and famines throughout the dynasties. But who would have imagined that the scenery beyond the Great Wall is so beautiful today! The desolate ancient battlefield is now covered with flowers and fruits, and grapes cover the mountains. The Hunshui rice grown here is even tastier than the rice from Lingnan. In winter, the mountains north and south of the Sanggan River are covered in frost and snow, and the vast plains are magnificent. In spring, weeping willows sway, clear springs flow, and flowers are like clouds and grass is like carpets, as beautiful as southern China. During breaks from labor, looking at the magnificent landscape, reflecting on the past and present, I feel that every grape and every flower embodies the Party's dedication and the sweat of our farmer brothers. I can't help but make a few small sketches of the spring scenery beyond the Great Wall, recording my personal experiences. I also hope this will serve as an invitation to comrades who love scenery.

    Today on the ancient battlefield:
    Great winds shake mountains and uproot trees,
    Sand and dust obscure the sun and sky.
    The Sanggan and Yang Rivers are nowhere to be seen,
    But there are figures moving on the southern slope.
    Who is over there?
    Green willows dance wildly in the wind,
    Apricot flowers flutter their skirts.
    The ancient battlefield has become a land of rice and grain,
    Qin Shi Huang wouldn't believe it!

    Picking Fruit in the Orchard
    The orchard is shady green in the evening,
    The well water is clear under the pear blossoms.
    Part the petals and draw a bucket of water,
    Frogs croak two or three times.

    Washing Clothes
    Washing clothes in the clear spring water,
    Sparse willows reflect the setting sun.
    Raise your head and listen to the birds sing,
    The trees are full of flowers, like southern China.

  Listening to Evening Study at the People's School
    During the day, wild winds and sandstorms rage,
    In the evening, stars and moon shine together.
    Beyond the Great Wall, the sky is high and the sunset is low,
    The sound of reading in the people's school is soft.

  Walking the Mountain Gully
    Peach blossoms and willows fill the mountain gully,
    Winding and turning without end.
    Ten thousand years of small stream flows,
    Jumping off cliffs and穿石, following me.
    White clouds float overhead,
    Little eagles learn to fly,
    The small stream transforms into a small pond,
    Reflecting the colorful jacket of the willows,
    It turns out to be—
    The girl from the cafeteria coming down the mountain to fetch water,
    And the peach and apricot trees together,
    Have changed into spring clothes.

    Peach Blossoms
    In March, peach blossoms smile in the spring breeze,
    Sixteen-year-old daughters are delicate and red.
    Old Grandpa Heaven pampers her, who can compete?
    The most beautiful spring scenery belongs to her!

    In the garden, there is a small peach tree, right next to the path, leaning against an old pear tree, truly like a spoiled and adorable little granddaughter.

    Returning Late
    The setting sun and the ancient castle set off the distant mountains,
    Returning from work, crossing the small river beach,
    Sheep bleat and go to drink water,
    Another day of diligent cultivation.

    塞上景色如画
    闻山
    在黄帝与蚩尤作战的“涿鹿之野”，沿桑干河南岸，是怀来县果林公社。自古以来，人们把塞上说得一片荒凉，保安册志和怀来县志中，这里历朝历代，大旱、瘟疫、蝗灾、饥荒，连年不断。但谁想得到，今日的塞上，竟是如此美丽！过去荒凉的古战场，如今花果遍野，葡萄漫山，浑水稻种得比岭南大米还好吃。冬季，桑干河南北，群山披霜拥雪，茫茫平野，壮伟非常；春天，却又绿柳婆娑，清泉流水，花如云雾草如茵，似江南一般秀丽。劳动歇息时，看大好山河，怀古思今，觉得一串葡萄一朵花，都是党的心血和农民兄弟的汗珠，情不自禁，便为塞上春景作几幅小素描，记下亲身经历；也算做一次邀请，致爱风景的同志。
    古战场今日大风摇山拔树，沙尘蔽日封天，桑干、洋河都不见，南山坡上人影动，谁在那边？绿柳迎风怒舞，杏花裙袖翩?，古战场变米粮川，怕秦始皇不信！
    挑水果园傍晚绿荫荫，梨花底下井水清，拨开花瓣打桶水，蛙儿叫唤两三声。
    洗衣清清泉水洗衣裳，疏疏杨柳映夕阳，抬头细听鸟儿唱，满树繁花似江南。
  听民校夜读白日风狂沙暴，傍晚星月交辉，塞上天高晚霞低，民校读书声细。
  走山沟桃花杨柳满山沟，弯弯曲曲不到头，万年小溪水长流，跳崖穿石跟我走。头顶白云飘，小鹰学飞翔，小溪摇身变个小池塘，照见杨柳倒影花花袄，原来是——食堂的姑娘下山来打水，和桃杏一起，换了春装。
    桃花三月桃花笑春风，十六岁女儿娇又红，天老爷爷宠她谁争得过？满园春色数她浓！
    园里有一株小桃花，就靠着小路旁，依着老梨树，真像一个撒娇的可爱的小孙女儿。
    晚归夕阳古堡衬远山，收工回过小河滩，羊儿咩咩喝水去，辛勤耕作又一天。
