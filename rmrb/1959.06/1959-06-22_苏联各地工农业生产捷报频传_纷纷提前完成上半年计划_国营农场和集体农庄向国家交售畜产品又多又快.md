Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st - Good news continues to pour in from all over the Soviet Union recently about industry and agriculture completing their production plans and product sales plans for the first half of this year ahead of schedule.

    The Ukrainian Republic has now completely fulfilled its plan for selling livestock products such as meat, milk, and eggs to the state for the first half of this year. Compared with the same period last year, state farms and collective farms throughout the republic sold more than 130,000 tons more meat, more than 500,000 tons more milk, and 300 million more eggs to the state in the first half of this year.

    The Lithuanian Republic also completed its meat sales plan for the first half of this year ahead of schedule. The republic sold 24,000 tons more meat to the state than last year. In addition, the Komi Autonomous Republic in the Russian Federation, as well as the Sverdlovsk and Kostroma regions, have also completed their livestock product sales plans for the first half of this year.

    Analyzing the completion of livestock product sales plans shows that the time it took for various parts of the Soviet Union to complete their livestock product sales tasks ahead of schedule in the first half of this year was earlier than last year, and the sales volume also increased significantly compared to last year. For example, Ukraine, Sverdlovsk, and Kostroma completed their livestock product sales tasks for the first half of this year half a month ahead of schedule. The Komi Autonomous Republic even completed its sales plan on June 10.

    In terms of sales volume, Kostroma region sold 1.2 times more meat in the first half of this year than in the first half of last year, milk and wool increased by 50%, and eggs increased by 30%. In the Sverdlovsk region, meat sales increased by 25%, milk increased by 22%, and eggs increased by 43%. This situation is closely related to the accelerated development of animal husbandry in the Soviet Union this year. Taking the Ukrainian Republic as an example, the republic's meat production in the first five months of this year increased by 44% compared to the same period last year, and milk increased by 24%.

    In the industrial field, many industrial enterprises in Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Kirovograd and other places have recently completed their production tasks for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. The Kirovograd Pumping Machine Factory completed its production plan on June 11 ahead of schedule and saved the state more than one million rubles by reducing production costs.

    Based on this victory, the wave of competition to complete this year's plan and the Seven-Year Plan even earlier, which has been launched by Soviet enterprises, is developing vigorously.

In the past, processing motor equipment required two shifts with a total of twenty-two people to operate twelve machines, but now only four people are needed to operate the automated production line, and the efficiency of the work has also doubled.

    苏联各地工农业生产捷报频传
    纷纷提前完成上半年计划
    国营农场和集体农庄向国家交售畜产品又多又快
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联各地最近不断传来工农业提前完成今年前半年的生产计划和产品交售计划的捷报。
    乌克兰共和国现在已经全部完成了今年前半年向国家交售肉类、牛奶、鸡蛋等畜产品的计划。今年头半年和去年同期比较，全共和国的国营农场和集体农庄交售给国家的肉类增加了十三万多吨，牛奶增加了五十多万吨，鸡蛋增加了三亿枚。
    立陶宛共和国今年头半年的肉类交售计划也提前完成了。共和国交售给国家的肉类比去年增加了二万四千吨。此外，完成今年头半年畜产品交售计划的还有俄罗斯联邦的科米自治共和国以及斯维德洛夫斯克、科斯特罗马等州。
    把完成畜产品交售计划的情况加以分析，可以看出，今年头半年苏联各地提前完成畜产品交售任务的时间都比去年更加提早了，交售量也比去年增加很多。例如，乌克兰、斯维德洛夫斯克、科斯特罗马等地都是提前半个月完成今年头半年的畜产品交售任务的。科米自治共和国的交售计划甚至在6月10日就完成了。
    在交售量方面，今年头半年科斯特罗马州交售的肉类就比去年前半年多一点二倍，牛奶和羊毛增加了50％，鸡蛋增加了30％。在斯维德洛夫斯克州，肉类交售量增加了25％，牛奶增加了22％，鸡蛋增加了43％。这种情况与今年苏联畜牧业的发展速度更加加快有着密切的关系。以乌克兰共和国为例，今年头五个月共和国的肉类生产量就比去年同期增加了44％，牛奶增加了24％。
    在工业方面，莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、基洛夫格勒等地的许多工业企业最近已纷纷提前完成头半年的生产任务。基洛夫格勒的联动机工厂的生产计划在6月11日就提前完成了，而且从降低生产成本中为国家节约了一百多万卢布。
    在这个胜利基础上，苏联各企业展开的更早提前完成今年计划和个七年计划的竞赛浪潮正在发展整中。
