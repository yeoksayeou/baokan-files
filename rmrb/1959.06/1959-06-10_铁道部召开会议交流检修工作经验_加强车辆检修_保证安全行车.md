Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 9th. The Ministry of Railways convened a national railway vehicle department meeting in Jilin City from May 25th to June 4th, requiring railway vehicle departments to mobilize employees to strengthen vehicle maintenance and overhaul work, prevent accidents, and ensure transportation safety.

The meeting pointed out that at present, due to the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the utilization rate of railway vehicles is constantly increasing. The average daily number of loaded cars on the national railways in December last year increased from more than 21,000 at the beginning of the year to more than 31,000, and in May of this year, it increased to more than 36,000. Under these circumstances, vehicle maintenance and overhaul work must be strengthened accordingly to effectively improve transportation efficiency and ensure safe transportation. The one-sided view of only pursuing improved transportation efficiency and neglecting vehicle overhaul and maintenance should be overcome.

The meeting believes that in order to fundamentally prevent locomotive damage accidents, it is necessary to implement the policy of prevention first, rely on the masses, grasp the laws of accident occurrence, and take measures in advance to prevent accidents. According to past experience, the main reasons for vehicle accidents are missed inspections, missed repairs, or only inspections without repairs. Therefore, in the future, overhaul work must be strengthened at all levels. In addition to carrying out vehicle overhauls, medium repairs, and annual repairs on schedule, special attention should be paid to strengthening daily maintenance and overhaul work on the lines. The primary key to doing this work well is to improve various overhaul organizations and strengthen the work of train inspection stations on the lines, braking inspection stations in high-slope areas, and loading and unloading inspection stations at loading and unloading stations. These inspection stations are the basic forces for daily maintenance and overhaul of vehicles and are the vanguards in preventing accidents. They must not be arbitrarily revoked or weakened. In these inspection organizations, the responsibility system should be strictly implemented, and the responsibility for maintenance should be earnestly undertaken to ensure the safe operation of trains.

Strictly implementing various overhaul systems and overhaul operation procedures is an important link in preventing accidents. Following these systems and procedures will eliminate the phenomenon of missed inspections, missed repairs, and simplified overhaul procedures. To this end, this meeting, in the spirit of "breaking what should be broken and establishing what should be established," discussed various rules and regulations for overhaul work and overhaul operation procedures, revised a number of systems and procedures, and required all vehicle departments to mobilize employees to seriously discuss them, finalize them, and then implement them conscientiously.

This meeting exchanged and summarized 148 advanced experiences in overhaul work, held an exhibition of overhaul tools, an analysis exhibition of damaged parts, and a performance of the operation process of advanced overhaul methods.

The meeting commended advanced units and advanced vehicle inspectors who prevented vehicle accidents, including: the vehicle department of the Jilin Railway Bureau, which had no major accidents for seven years; the Tumen Vehicle Depot, which had never had a major accident in thirteen years and nine months since liberation; the Beijing Passenger Vehicle Depot, which had no major accidents for ten years; and Yin Chengliang, a vehicle inspector at the Qiqihar Vehicle Depot, who had no accidents of any kind for three thousand three hundred and ninety days; and the axle group of the Jilin Vehicle Depot, which had inspected more than 1,900 wheel damages since 1950 without any accidents.

    铁道部召开会议交流检修工作经验
    加强车辆检修　保证安全行车
    据新华社吉林9日电　铁道部于5月25日至6月4日在吉林市召开全国铁路车辆部门的会议，要求铁路车辆部门动员职工加强车辆的维护检修工作，防止事故，保证运输安全。
    会议指出，目前，由于工农业生产不断跃进，铁路车辆的利用率不断提高。去年12月份全国铁路的每天平均装车数目，由年初的两万一千余车增加到三万一千余车，今年5月份又增加到三万六千余车。在这种情况下，车辆的维护检修工作必须相应加强，才能有效地提高运输效率和保证安全运输。只追求提高运输效率、忽视车辆检修维护的片面观点应当克服。
    会议认为，为了从根本上防止机车损坏事故发生，必须贯彻预防为主的方针，依靠群众，掌握事故发生的规律，预先采取措施，防止事故发生。根据过去的情况，造成车辆事故的主要原因是漏检、漏修或只检不修。因此，今后必须逐级加强检修工作，除了按期进行车辆的大修、中修和年修以外，要特别加强线路上的日常维护检修工作。做好这些工作的首要关键是健全各种检修机构，加强线路上的列车检修所、高坡地区的制动检修所和装卸站的装卸检修所的工作。这些检修所都是日常维护检修车辆的基本力量，是防止事故的尖兵，不得随意撤销或削弱它们的工作。在这些检修机构中，应该严格贯彻责任制，切实承担维修保养责任，保证列车安全行驶。
    严格执行各种检修制度和检修作业规程，是防止事故的重要一环。按照这些制度和规程办事，就会消灭漏检、漏修和简化检修程序的现象。为此，这次会议本着“该破的破，该立的立”的精神，讨论了检修工作的各种规章制度和检修作业规程，修订了一批制度和规程，要求各车辆部门发动职工认真讨论，定案后就切实执行。
    这次会议交流和总结了一百四十八项检修工作的先进经验，举行了检修工具展览、破损零件的分析展览和先进检修方法的作业过程表演。
    会议表扬了防止车辆事故的先进单位和先进检车员，其中有：七年无重大和大事故的吉林铁路局车辆部门；解放以来十三年九个月从未发生重大和大事故的图们车辆段；十年无重大和大事故的北京客车段；三千三百九十天无任何责任事故的齐齐哈尔车辆段检车员尹成良；从1950年以来检查出一千九百余处轮伤，无任何责任事故的吉林车辆段轮轴组。
