Chicks Fill the Village, Ducks Fill the Ponds

Since Qu County, Zhejiang, vigorously promoted spring hatching in February, poultry production has greatly developed, and a thriving scene of "chicks filling the villages, ducks and geese filling the ponds" has appeared everywhere. By the end of May, the county had 1,028,252 poultry, an increase of 295% compared with the end of 1958. The county has 115,705 households, with an average of 8.8 poultry per household. Yan Jiawei Production Team of the Huayuan Commune, which has developed the fastest, now has an average of 25.2 poultry per household.

In order to rapidly develop poultry production, the county carried out extensive publicity and education, vigorously publicized the Party's policies, and repeatedly explained to the masses that the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulated that commune members could engage in some household side occupations and raise small livestock and poultry, provided that it did not hinder their participation in collective labor. They also calculated detailed accounts with the masses and educated them with typical examples of increasing income by raising chickens and ducks. Through publicity and education, the enthusiasm of the masses in raising poultry has been greatly encouraged.

In order to rapidly develop poultry production, the county Party committee resolutely implemented the policy of walking on two legs. While vigorously calling for the development of private breeding by commune members, it also continued to develop collective breeding. Specific regulations stipulated that all canteens should raise chickens, with chicks supplied by the hatching workshops, and the eggs laid could belong to the canteen for improving the lives of commune members. Duck flocks were directly raised by production teams.

During the spring hatching period, in order to exchange spring hatching experience and promote the great development of poultry production, the county Party committee held an on-site meeting on actively developing poultry production in Yan Jiawei Production Team of the Huayuan Commune. Communes also held on-site meetings one after another, quickly spreading advanced experience, and adopting the policy of "mainly hatching by old hens, supplemented by hatching workshops" to vigorously carry out poultry spring hatching work.

In solving the feed problem, the following measures are mainly adopted: using agricultural and sideline products, feeding chicks and hens with rice bran; feeding more animal feed, such as small insects, earthworms, and maggots in ponds; also using cow dung, garbage, and rice husks to make insect breeding piles for raising insects to feed chickens, with each household having preferably three or four piles for rotation; grazing: when crops are harvested, using chicken cages to carry chickens to the harvested fields, allowing them to peck freely, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, generally without the need for other feed.

    小鸡满村鸭满塘
    浙江衢县自2月间大抓春孵工作以来，家禽生产有了很大的发展，到处出现“毛鸡满村坊，鸭鹅满池塘”的兴旺景象。5月底，全县已有家禽一百零二万八千二百五十二只，比1958年底增加295％，全县十一万五千七百零五户，平均每户饲养家禽八点八只。发展最快的花园公社严家圩生产队，现在每户平均饲养家禽二十五点二只。
    为了迅速发展家禽生产，这个县开展了广泛的宣传教育工作，大力宣传党的方针政策，反复向群众说明中共中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中已规定社员可以在不妨碍参加集体劳动的条件下，经营一些家庭小副业，饲养小家畜和家禽等。并且还和群众算了细账，以养鸡鸭增加收入的典型事例来教育群众。通过宣传教育，大大鼓舞了群众的养家禽的积极性。
    为了迅速发展家禽生产，县委坚决贯彻执行了两条腿走路的方针，在大力号召发展社员私人饲养的同时，也继续发展集体饲养。具体规定了食堂都要养鸡，小鸡由孵坊供给，生下的鸡蛋可以归食堂所有，用于改善社员生活。群鸭则由生产队直接设场饲养。
    在春孵期间，县委为了交流春孵经验，促进家禽生产大发展，曾在花园公社严家圩生产队召开了积极发展家禽生产的现场会议，各公社也纷纷召开了现场会议，速迅传播先进经验，采取“以老母鸡孵化为主，孵坊孵化为辅”的方针，大力开展家禽春孵工作。
    在解决饲料问题上，主要采取如下几个办法：利用农副产品，用糠头喂小鸡和母鸡；多喂动物性饲料，如水塘里的小虫、蚯蚓、粪蛆等；也可用牛粪、垃圾、砻糠堆积起来，制成育虫堆，育虫喂鸡，一家最好有三、四堆，轮流使用；放牧：在庄稼收获时用鸡笼把鸡挑到已收割过的田里，让它自由啄食，早晨下午各一次，一般就不再需要其他饲料。
