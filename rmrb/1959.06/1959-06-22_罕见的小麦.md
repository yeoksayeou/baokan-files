　　Three rare types of wheat have been discovered in the Liujiagou People's Commune, Penglai County, Shandong Province.

　　Double-Eared Wheat
　　The Double-Eared Wheat has two ears hanging side by side on one stalk. According to measurements by technicians, the plant is 48 cm tall, with the stalk splitting into a fork at the slightly flattened top. Each ear is about 6 cm long, containing a total of 80 plump grains.

　　Wheat King
　　Ordinary wheat typically produces 5 or 6 tillers per plant, but this "Bima No. 4" wheat plant produced 65 tillers, with 63 of them growing plump ears of grain at the top. Measurements show its tallest stalk is 116.5 cm, the longest ear is 8.3 cm, and there are a total of 342 grains. On average, each ear has more than 48 grains, and the total weight of the grains is three liang, two qian and four fen.

　　Multi-Grain Ear
　　Common wheat ears usually have around 30 grains, but the commune has selected seven large ears with more than 100 grains each. One ear even has as many as 140 grains.

　　Scientific research personnel have made specimens of these wheat varieties.

    罕见的小麦
　　山东蓬莱县刘家沟人民公社发现三种少见的小麦。
    双穗麦
　　双穗麦的两个麦穗并挂在一根麦秆上。据技术人员测量，株高四十八公分，在略显扁状形的麦秆顶部开叉，两个麦穗各长约六公分，共有八十个饱满的麦粒。
    小麦王
    一般小麦每株分蘖五、六个株秆，而这一株“碧蚂四号”小麦，却分蘖出六十五根株秆，其中六十三根株秆的顶端都生长了籽粒饱满的麦穗。经测量，它的最高株秆是一百一十六点五公分，最长的麦穗为八点三公分，麦粒共有三百四十二个，平均每个麦穗有四十八个多麦粒，麦粒的总重量有三两二钱四分。
    多粒穗
    人们常见的麦穗都是三十个麦粒左右，这个公社却选出了七个百粒以上的大麦穗，其中有一穗麦粒竟高达一百四十个。
    科学研究人员已把这些小麦制成标本。
