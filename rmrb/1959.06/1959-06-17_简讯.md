    Ningxia's Transportation Network Initially Formed
    The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has preliminarily formed a transportation network of highways, railways, and inland river shipping.
    There are now 410 kilometers of railways within the Autonomous Region. More than 3,900 kilometers of highways, directly or indirectly connected to the railways, can reach all the county seats in the region. In the southern mountainous area with rolling hills and crisscrossing gullies, not only are counties connected by automobiles, but most of the communes and mining areas also have automobile traffic. The navigable mileage of the Yellow River has reached 395 kilometers. After the establishment of the Autonomous Region, an air route from Yinchuan, the capital of the Autonomous Region, to Beijing was also opened.
    
    The Longest Tunnel on the Neikun Railway Line
    The longest tunnel on the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, the Qiewu Tunnel, is under rapid construction. In mid-May, a certain unit of the railway soldiers at the north entrance site created the highest record in the entire railway soldiers, advancing 9.323 meters into the tunnel in a single day. The tunnel is 2,565 meters long and is located at the southern foot of the Wumeng Mountains on the northeastern border of Yunnan, straddling Guizhou and Yunnan provinces. It is a key project to control the overall construction period of the entire Neikun Railway line.

    Guangzhou Paper Mill Produces Sulfuric Acid
    The sulfuric acid plant attached to the Guangzhou Paper Mill has recently been completed and has begun trial production.
    After the plant is fully put into production, it will have an annual output of 7,200 tons of sulfuric acid according to its design capacity, which can basically meet the current needs of Guangzhou's light industry for sulfuric acid.

    Fuzhou Builds Antibiotic Factory
    The Fuzhou Antibiotic Factory is under intense construction.
    This factory is one of the larger antibiotic factories currently under construction in our country. Its main products include chlortetracycline, vitamin B-2, etc., as well as by-products such as dried mycelia that can be used as feed.

    Shanxi Transforms a Batch of Small Coal Mines
    Shanxi Province has launched a technical transformation movement for small coal mines in the local coal mine system. Currently, twenty-six small kilns have implemented indigenous mechanization, renovated roadways, and are using small flatcars for transportation and horse-drawn winches for lifting. Sixteen have achieved semi-indigenous, semi-foreign mechanization, using steam winches (or electric winches) for lifting, indigenous track coal cars, and pumps for drainage. As a result, the production capacity of small coal mines throughout the province has increased from the original annual output of 580,000 tons to 1.92 million tons.
    The vast majority of the coal produced by these small coal mines is supplied to local iron and steel bases and other industrial needs.

    宁夏交通网初步形成
    宁夏回族自治区初步形成公路、铁路、内河航运的交通运输网。
    自治区境内现在已经有四百一十公里铁路。同铁路直接或间接衔接起来的三千九百多公里公路，可以通达区内所有的县城。岗峦起伏沟壑交错的南部山区，不仅县与县之间都通了汽车，县与大多数的公社、矿区也有汽车往来。黄河通航里程达到三百九十五公里。自治区成立后，还开辟了自治区首府银川市到北京的航空线。
    内昆线上最长的隧道
    内江昆明铁路最长隧道——且乌大隧道，正在快速施工。北口工地的铁道兵某部在5月中旬曾经创造了日进成洞九点三二三公尺的铁道兵全军最高纪录。这条隧道全长二千五百六十五公尺，位于滇东北边境的乌蒙山南麓，横锁黔滇，是控制内昆路全线工期的关键工程。
    广州造纸厂生产硫酸
    广州造纸厂附设的硫酸厂最近建成，并开始试车生产。
    这个厂全部投入生产后，按照设计能力将年产硫酸七千二百吨，可以基本上满足目前广州市轻工业对硫酸的需要。
    福州兴建抗菌素工厂
    福州抗菌素厂正在紧张建设。
    这个厂是目前我国正在兴建的规模较大的抗菌素厂之一。它的主要产品有金霉素、维生素B—2等，还有可以作饲料的副产品干菌丝等。
    山西改造一批小煤井
    山西省在地方煤矿系统中掀起了一个小煤窑技术改造运动。现在，有二十六个小窑实行了土机械化、改建了巷道，利用小平车搬运，马拉绞车提升。有十六个实现了半土半洋机械化，利用了汽绞车（或电绞车）提升、土道轨煤车和水泵排水等。全省小煤窑的生产能力因此由原年产五十八万吨，提高到一百九十二万吨。
    这些小煤窑生产的煤绝大部分是供应当地钢铁基地和其它工业需用的。
