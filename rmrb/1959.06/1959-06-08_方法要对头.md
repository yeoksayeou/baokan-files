Post-Editing Notes:

    Methods Must Be Correct

    When handling matters, one must pay attention to methods. If the methods are correct, one can achieve twice the result with half the effort; if the methods are incorrect, one will achieve half the result with twice the effort, or even fail. Comrade Zhang Xiangli, the county party secretary in the "Two Sisters Competition," is an example of someone who pays attention to methods. When Guo Aimei and Jiao Lianying were competing and unwilling to concede to each other, he adopted methods of enlightenment and guidance. Guo and Jiao are young people, and it is not strange for them to make mistakes. The problem lies in how the leading comrades treat it. Comrade Zhang Xiangli opposed simplistic methods. Adopting methods of enlightenment and guidance yielded positive results.

    At present, the flowers of socialist labor emulation have bloomed all over the country. However, the road of this competition will not be a straight line without twists and turns. The responsibility of the leadership lies in seizing the opportunity, adopting different methods according to different situations, and leading this competition to even greater heights.

    方法要对头
    办事情，要讲究方法。方法对头，事半功倍；方法不对头，事倍功半，甚至失败。“两姐妹竞赛”中的县委书记张相礼同志是讲究方法的一个范例。他在郭爱美，焦莲英为了竞赛而互不服气的时候，采取了启发和诱导的方法，郭、焦两人是年轻人，犯了毛病，并不奇怪，问题在于领导同志怎么对待它。张相礼同志反对简单化的方法。采取了启发和诱导的方法，收到了成效。
    目前，社会主义劳动竞赛的鲜花，已开遍全国。但这一竞赛的道路，却不会是一条直线毫无曲折的。领导的责任，就在于抓住时机，根据不同情况，采取不同方法，把这一竞赛引向更高峰。
