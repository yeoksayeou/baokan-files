American Troops Commit All Kinds of Evil in South Korea

    The Korean armistice has been in effect for six years, but the American aggressor troops are still clinging to South Korea, committing all kinds of evil and bringing endless disasters to the South Korean people.
    Before the ink on the Korean armistice agreement was dry, the United States openly violated the agreement, illegally transporting large quantities of military equipment, vigorously reorganizing the American troops invading Korea, and strengthening its military control over South Korea. In the second half of 1957, the United States moved the headquarters of the American troops invading Korea from Japan to South Korea, and frantically deployed for atomic warfare. In that year, the first American "atomic division" was established. In January 1958, 280mm atomic cannons were shipped in. Then, "Honest John" rockets capable of carrying nuclear warheads were shipped in from Japan, and the so-called "Fourth Missile Command" was formally established, missile bases were built, and "Matador" missiles were shipped in at the end of last year. Recently, Major General Seaman, the head of the U.S. Army's equipment, requested Congress to allocate $7 million for construction projects for the U.S. military in South Korea. According to military sources quoted by UPI, this is to deploy "Nike" missiles to South Korea.
    At the same time, American imperialism is also vigorously expanding and strengthening the Li pseudo-army in order to realize its conspiracy of using "Asians to fight Asians." To date, the Li pseudo-army has been expanded to 21 active divisions and 10 reserve divisions (720,000 men). Now the United States is preparing to further reorganize the Li pseudo-army to make them cannon fodder for atomic warfare. On the one hand, it provides the Li pseudo-army with various new weapons, including F86 Sabre jet fighters and new naval vessels; on the other hand, it trains the Li pseudo-army to prepare for "atomic warfare" and constantly conducts "atomic attack exercises." On January 15 this year, the U.S. military and the Li pseudo-army conducted a "joint atomic attack exercise" near the military demarcation line.
    The American aggressor troops entrenched in South Korea kill, set fires, rape, plunder, and commit all kinds of crimes. Judging from some of the known materials, the atrocities of the American military are appalling.
    On April 16, 1957, Captain Smith, the commander of the 24th Division Military Police Company, led 80 military police to surround Longzhou Cave in Yeonpung-ri, Gyeonggi-do, searched 150 South Korean farm households, and robbed property worth 3.5 million South Korean won.
    In August last year, an American corporal from the U.S. military advisory group stationed in Daejeon raped a 50-year-old Korean woman! Then he killed her and set fire to her house.
    In the first four months of this year, there were more than 100 cases of atrocities committed by the U.S. military.
    The American occupation authorities always try to exonerate the murderers by slandering the victims as "robbers" or "prostitutes," or by mitigating the murderers' crimes with the so-called "ordinary assault incidents," so that the criminal American soldiers can escape justice.
    The American troops invading Korea also massively destroy and plunder Korea's precious cultural relics and national treasures. They set fire to Chang'an Temple in Mount Kumgang, a world-famous scenic spot, blew up the world-renowned Anak Goguryeo mural tombs with grenades, and robbed the Silla gold crowns, of which there were only two in Korea, from the Central Museum of Gyeongbok Palace in Seoul, as well as the precious metal burial objects of the Silla era unearthed in Gyeongju, the sculptures of the Three Kingdoms period of Korea, and the ancient porcelain of the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties from the Deoksu Palace Art Museum... By the end of 1951, the cultural relics plundered by the U.S. military, according to incomplete statistics, had reached more than 70% of all cultural relics. But the U.S. military is still continuing to plunder. According to a report by the South Korean Dongyang News Agency, in October 1957, the U.S. Navy shipped away 186 ancient cultural relics in one batch.
    The South Korean people hate the American occupation troops who commit all kinds of evil to the bone and are carrying out struggles. Together with the people of North Korea, they demand that the American occupation troops get out of South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of Korea.

### 美国军队在南朝鲜无恶不作

    美国军队在南朝鲜无恶不作
    朝鲜停战已经六年，可是美国侵略军仍然死赖在南朝鲜，无恶不作，给南朝鲜人民带来了无穷的灾难。
    朝鲜停战协定的墨迹还未干，美国便公然违犯协定，非法运进大批军事装备，大力整编侵朝美军，加强对南朝鲜的军事控制。1957年下半年，美国把在日本的侵朝美军司令部迁进南朝鲜，狂热地部署原子战争。在这一年里建立了第一个美军“原子师”。1958年1月，进运了二百八十公厘的原子炮。接着又从日本运入了能装载核弹头的“诚实的约翰”火箭，正式成立所谓“第四导弹司令部”，建立了导弹基地，去年年底，又运进了“斗牛士”式导弹。最近，美国陆军装备负责人西曼少将向国会要求拨款七百万美元，作为美军在南朝鲜进行建筑工程之用。据合众国际社引军方人士的话透露，这是为了把“奈克”式导弹部署到南朝鲜。
    与此同时，美帝国主义还大力扩充和加强李伪军，以实现其用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。到目前止，李伪军已扩大到二十一个现役师和十个后备师（七十二万人）。现在美国又准备进一步整编李伪军，使之充当原子战争的炮灰。它一方面向李伪军提供各种新式武器，包括F86式佩刀式喷气战斗机，新式海军舰艇；另一方面训练李伪军从事“原子战争”的准备，不断举行“原子攻击演习”。今年1月15日，美军便曾会同李伪军在军事分界线附近举行“联合原子攻击演习”。
    盘踞在南朝鲜的美国侵略军杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，无所不为。仅就已经知道的一些材料看来，美军暴行令人发指。
    1957年4月16日，美军二十四师宪兵连连长史密斯上尉，带领八十名宪兵，包围了京畿道延丰里龙州洞，搜查了一百五十家南朝鲜农户，抢去价值南朝鲜币三百五十万圆的财物。
    去年8月里，驻大田的美军顾问团的一个美军下士，强奸了一个年已五十的朝鲜老太婆！随后把她杀死，还放火烧了她的房子。
    今年头四个月，美军暴行案就达一百多起。
    美国占领军当局总是用诬蔑被害者是“强盗”、“妓女”等等来开脱凶手，或是用所谓“普通的殴打事件”的说法减轻凶手的罪行，使犯罪的美国士兵得以逍遥法外。
    侵朝美军还大量破坏和搜劫朝鲜的珍贵文物和国宝。他们放火烧毁了世界名胜金刚山的长安寺，用手榴弹炸毁举世闻名的安岳高句丽壁画古坆，劫走了汉城景福宫中央博物馆内所藏的、在朝鲜只有两个的新罗金冠，在德庆宫美术馆中所藏的庆州出土新罗时代的贵金属殉葬物、朝鲜三国时代的雕刻、高丽朝、李朝的古磁……到1951年底为止，被美军所掠走的文物，据不完全的统计，已达全部文物的百分之七十以上。但美军还在继续搜劫。据南朝鲜东洋通讯社报道，在1957年的10月里，美国海军曾一批运走了一百八十六件古代文物。
    南朝鲜人民对于无恶不作的美国占领军恨之入骨，进行着斗争。他们同朝鲜北部人民一起要求美国占领军滚出南朝鲜，实现朝鲜的和平统一。
