Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 31st. The Indian newspaper "The Free Press" reported on May 31st that "volunteers" of the so-called "All-India Tibet Convention" were distributing a "communique" for the so-called "National Volunteer Defense Army" organized by Tibetan bandit rebels.

	The "communique" demanded "sympathy and support for the unfortunate Tibetan people in their struggle against oppression and tyranny." The communique slandered the Chinese government as "imperialist" and "aggressor."

	According to reports, this "communique" was distributed at the request of Sonam Gyatso, a Tibetan bandit rebel who spoke at the "All-India Tibet Convention" on the 30th. The English translation of his pre-printed speech was read by K.K. Sinha, a leader of the so-called "Asian Association for Cultural Freedom," which is supported by Americans.

	"The Free Press" stated that the communique did not have the name of the printer. This means that the communique is illegal. The newspaper wrote that it is understood that the "National Volunteer Defense Army" is an organization of Tibetan insurgents. It has a branch in Kalimpong, and its leader is Alo Chonze.

	The newspaper said that the organization's headquarters in Kalimpong sent a congratulatory telegram to the "All-India Tibet Convention." The newspaper wrote that journalists were shocked that Tibetan reactionary rebels could openly distribute illegal communiques. The newspaper added that the communique reveals how deep the connection between this "All-India Tibet Convention" and the Tibetan reactionary group is.

	According to a Calcutta dispatch, Dalai Lama's two brothers—the traitors Gyalo Thondup and Norbu—as well as five bandits from Mussoorie (including some members of the dissolved Tibetan Kashag), were secretly met by Jayaprakash Narayan and Dr. Majumdar in Calcutta on the morning of the 30th. Some of these bandits will participate in the "All-India Tibet Convention" as "observers."

	Narayan went to Calcutta to preside over the "All-India Tibet Convention." Majumdar is the chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the "All-India Tibet Convention."

    “全印西藏会议”丑上加丑
    公然为西藏叛匪散发“公报”
    新华社新德里31日电　印度“自由报”31日报道，所谓“全印西藏会议”的“志愿工作者”为西藏叛匪组织的所谓“民族志愿保卫军”散发了一份“公报”。
      “公报”要求“同情和支持不幸的西藏人民为反对压迫和暴政的斗争”。公报诬蔑中国政府是“帝国主义”和“侵略者”。
    据报道，这个“公报”是应30日曾在“全印西藏会议”上讲话的西藏叛匪索南嘉措的要求散发的。他的事先印好的讲话英文译稿，是由美国人支持的所谓“亚洲文化自由协会”的一名领导人克·克·辛哈宣读的。
      “自由报”说，公报上没有印刷所的名字。这意味着这项公报是非法的。这家报纸写道，据悉，“民族志愿保卫军”是西藏叛乱分子的组织。它在噶伦堡设有分支机构，它的领袖是阿乐群则。
    这家报纸说，这个组织设在噶伦堡的总部给“全印西藏会议”拍去了贺电。这家报纸写道，新闻界人士感到很惊骇，西藏反动叛乱分子怎么能够公开散发非法公报。这家报纸又说，公报透露出这次“全印西藏会议”同西藏反动集团的联系有多么深。
    据加尔各答消息说，达赖喇嘛的两个哥哥——叛国分子嘉乐登珠和诺布——以及从穆索里前去的五名叛匪（其中包括已被解散的西藏噶厦的某些成员），30日上午在加尔各答受到贾雅普拉卡希·纳拉扬和马朱达博士的秘密接见。其中有些叛匪将以“观察员”身份参加“全印西藏会议”。
    纳拉扬是前往加尔各答主持“全印西藏会议”的。马朱达是“全印西藏会议”筹备委员会的主席。
