Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric Dispatch: Yan Junli, an old lathe operator at the Shijiazhuang Vehicle Factory, who has not produced a single defective product for nine consecutive years, has been rated as a quality pacesetter in the factory's production increase and economy campaign.

Yan Junli entered the factory as an apprentice at the age of fourteen and has been working with machine tools for more than thirty years. Since liberation, under the party's cultivation and education, he has continuously improved his ideological awareness and technical level. In production, he has always attached importance to product quality and strictly abided by the process and operating procedures. As early as three years ago, he was rated by the factory as a "red flag" for "six years of no defective products" because of the good quality of his products. He was not satisfied with these achievements and continued to study diligently to improve his technical level.

Over the years, Yan Junli has processed various large, medium, and small parts on locomotives and freight cars. For processing workpieces of different shapes and complex techniques, he carefully considers the processing operation process in advance—rough when it should be rough, precise when it should be precise. This is Yan Junli's magic weapon for improving quality without affecting production efficiency. Once the lathe is running, he always pays attention to checking the caliper dimensions, thus preventing accidents affecting quality due to changes in caliper dimensions.

Yan Junli deeply understands that to continuously improve product quality, it is not enough to just pay attention to operating procedures and prepare well for production. More importantly, it is necessary to pay attention to machine maintenance and continuously improve technical level. Therefore, he often studies the performance of the machine, and when he finds that the machine has problems, he repairs it in time. The machine tool he uses has exceeded two major overhaul periods and has not been damaged at all. There has never been a quality accident caused by machine problems. He often pays attention to studying technical theory and is good at grasping the precision of products according to the nature of the material to ensure product quality. Once, when processing the copper sleeve on the "shaping machine," the specified precision could not differ by more than three-tenths of a millimeter. After clamping the workpiece on the machine tool, Yan Junli looked at the dimensions written on the job ticket and suddenly remembered the principle of cold contraction and thermal expansion taught by the teacher in the spare-time school. He considered: If he screwed it down according to the dimensions on the job ticket, it would be suitable when it was first screwed down, but wouldn't it "shrink" when it cooled down? Therefore, according to the relevant operating experience in the "Mechanical Worker" manual, he increased the original required coefficient by one-tenth of a millimeter, and the result was quite suitable. Over the past few years, he has always been so careful in his production, never letting go of any suspicious details.

Yan Junli always remembers what the Party told him: learn from each other and improve together, not only to be good yourself, but also to make everyone good. Therefore, he often enthusiastically helps workers in the next shift to sharpen their tools and find the right position, and leaves precise work for himself, giving easy work to the next shift.

    勤学苦练提高技术
    阎俊礼九年没出废品
    新华社天津电　连续九年没有出过一件废品的石家庄车辆工厂老车工阎俊礼，在增产节约运动中已被厂里评为优质标兵。
    阎俊礼从十四岁进厂学徒，到现在已经和机床打了三十多年的交道。解放后，他在党的培养教育下，不断地提高思想觉悟和技术水平。在生产上一贯重视产品质量，一丝不苟地遵守着工艺、操作规程。早在三年以前，他就因为产品质量好而被厂里评为“六年不出废品”的红旗。他没有满足这些成就，仍然继续苦心钻研，提高技术水平。
  这些年来，阎俊礼曾经加工过机车和货车上的各种大、中、小型的部件。他对加工形状不一和技术复杂的工作物，都事先周密地考虑好加工的作业过程，该粗的粗，该精的精，这是阎俊礼既提高质量又不影响生产效率的一条法宝。车床一开动起来，他总是经常注意核对卡钳尺寸，因而防止了因卡钳尺寸变动而影响质量的事故。
    阎俊礼深深体会到，要不断提高产品质量，光靠注意操作规程，作好生产准备还不够。更重要的是注意机器保养和不断提高技术水平。因此，他经常研究机器的性能，一发现机器有毛病就及时进行维修。他用的机床已经超过两个大修期了，还没有一点损伤。从来也没有因为机器有毛病造成质量事故。他经常注意学习技术理论，善于按照材料的性质来掌握产品的精密度，保证产品质量。有一次，加工“插床”上的铜套，规定精密度不能差过一公厘的十分之三。把工作物卡在机床上，阎俊礼又看了看派工单上写着的尺寸，突然想起在业余学校里老师讲的冷缩热涨的原理，他考虑：如果按派工单上的尺寸旋下去，刚旋好是合适的，一冷下来不就要“缩”了吗？于是他按照“机械工人”手册上的有关操作经验，比原来的要求系数加大了一公厘的十分之一，结果做出来的活挺合适。几年来，他在生产上总是这样细心钻研琢磨，从没有放过一点可疑的细节。
    阎俊礼经常记住党告诉他的一句话：互相学习，共同提高，不仅自己好，还要大家好。所以他常热心地帮助下班工人磨刀、找正，并把精密活留下自己作，好作的活让给下一班。
