   Intensify Publicity, Strengthen Leadership, Collect Whenever Available
   Wuwéi Completes Rapeseed Procurement Task
   Hefei Dispatch of this Newspaper, 19th – Wuwéi County in Anhui Province has exceeded its target of procuring ten million catties of rapeseed. Currently, the county is continuing to mobilize the masses to sell rapeseed, striving for an even greater overfulfillment of the procurement task.

   The reason why Wuwéi County's rapeseed procurement work has progressed rapidly is, first and foremost, that the procurement policies and methods have been repeatedly explained to cadres and the masses, clarifying the significance of completing the national rapeseed procurement task. In this way, the masses and cadres have established confidence in completing the national procurement task, recognizing that selling oilseeds benefits the country, the communes, and the commune members, thus laying the ideological foundation for completing the procurement task. Second, in order to strengthen leadership over the procurement work, the county committee adopted the method of assigning responsibility by area, going deep into each people's commune throughout the county, grasping agricultural production on the one hand and procurement work on the other, helping the communes solve many specific problems. Third, agricultural work and labor were reasonably arranged, so that summer harvesting, summer planting, field management, and the sale of oilseeds were taken into account in a coordinated manner. In addition, the county mobilized more than 14,000 people from organs, groups, troops, factories, mines, schools, and urban residents to help the communes harvest, thresh, dry, and transport rapeseed. Fourth, the procurement business was fully handled. The grain departments organized sufficient manpower and material resources to ensure that oilseeds were collected and paid for as soon as they arrived, without delaying the masses' time. In order to facilitate sales for the masses, the grain departments also increased the number of procurement points from forty-four to fifty-three, and dispatched one hundred and ten evaluators, custodians, etc. to the countryside to inspect the quality of rapeseed in the communes.

    深入宣传　加强领导　随到随收
    无为完成菜籽收购任务
    本报合肥19日电　安徽省无为县已超额完成一千万斤油菜籽的收购任务。现在，这个县正在继续动员群众出售油菜籽，争取收购任务有更大的超额。
    无为县油菜籽收购工作所以进展迅速，首先是向干部和群众反复交代了收购政策和办法，说明了完成国家油菜籽收购任务的意义。这样，群众和干部都树立了完成国家收购任务的信心，认识到出卖油料对国家、对公社、对社员都有好处，从而奠定了完成收购任务的思想基础。第二，县委为了加强对收购工作的领导，采取了分片负责的办法，深入到全县各个人民公社，一边抓农业生产，一边抓收购工作，帮助公社解决了许多具体问题。第三，合理的安排农活和劳力，使夏收、夏种、田间管理和出售油料统筹兼顾。另外，全县还从机关、团体、部队、厂矿、学校和城镇居民中动员一万四千多人，帮助公社收割、打晒和运送油菜籽。第四，充分地做好收购业务工作。粮食部门组织了足够的人力和物力，做到油料随到随收、随付款，不耽误群众的时间。粮食部门为了便利群众出售，还把收购点由四十四个增加到五十三个，并派出了一百一十个评价员、保管员等下乡，在公社检查油菜籽质量。
