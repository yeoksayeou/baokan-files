(Dispatch from our newspaper in Guangzhou, 8th) Guangdong Province, while successively holding materials exchange meetings and promoting the contract system of production and sales, has recently extensively established commune trade markets that are held regularly under unified national leadership. This type of market has become a suitable form for distributing and exchanging thousands upon thousands of scattered small commodities, promoting the development of production and enlivening the urban and rural economy.

Starting in late April, under the direct leadership of Party and government departments at all levels, commune markets were quickly established in various places. By early May, the Shantou Special District had established 318, equivalent to 90% of the original rural market towns in the special district.

The commune trade markets established in various places have greatly increased the variety and quantity of commodities on the market, and transactions are very active. On April 26, the Liusha Commune in Puning County held its first market day, with 965 kinds of commodities on the market, including eggs, milk tablets, fruits, vegetables, fish products, fuel, seeds, seedlings, small farm tools, small furniture, and general merchandise, a 60-fold increase compared to before the market was established. Some repair stalls were also set up. In half a day, the market turnover reached more than 7,500 yuan. According to statistics from the Puning County commune markets in early May, there were 4,300 kinds of commodities on the market, with total sales of more than 180,000 yuan. The masses were able to buy some daily necessities from the market, and many factories also bought some raw materials. On May 13, the first market day in Paitan Commune, Zengcheng County, was full of chickens, ducks, geese, eggs, Chinese mustard, and vegetables. In Chaoyang County's Gu Rao commune market, the number of commodities on the market increased from more than 70 on the first market day to more than 400 by the seventh.

The establishment of commune trade markets has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of communes, production teams, and individual members for sideline production. Many members are using their spare time to hunt, gather various wild animals and plants, or make various scattered commodities, accumulating some production funds for the commune and production team, and increasing their own income. In the four days before the first market day, the Xinhua Brigade of the Mianhu Commune in Jieyang County mobilized members to engage in sideline production, with a production value of 3,490 yuan. Within ten days of the establishment of the commune market in the Donglong Brigade of the Huicheng Commune in Puning County, members raised 9,000 chickens, an average of 1.8 per person. The First Production Team of the Heshan Commune once mobilized members to go up the mountain to pick wild plants, which were processed and sold in the market, earning more than 800 yuan in cash.

The purchasing and sales business of state-owned commercial departments has also expanded. In the first ten days (late April) after the establishment of the commune market, the total value of commodities purchased by the commercial system of Jieyang County in the market was 2.06 million yuan, an increase of 62.4% compared with mid-April; the total sales volume was 2.74 million yuan, an increase of 228% compared with mid-April. Because the market concentrates transactions and is convenient to manage, transactions between production and sales parties are orderly and prices are reasonable, the masses generally express satisfaction.

    在国家统一领导下定期交流大量小商品
    广东涌现公社贸易市场
    本报广州8日电　广东省各地最近在逐级召开物资交流会和推广产销合同制的同时，广泛建立了国家统一领导下的定期举行的公社贸易市场。这种市场已经成为分配和交换千千万万零星小商品的适当形式，促进了生产的发展和活跃了城乡经济。
    从4月下旬起，在各级党政部门的直接领导下，各地公社市场很快就建立起来了。汕头专区到5月上旬为止，就建立了三百一十八个，相当于这个专区过去原有的农村墟镇（市集）90％。
    各地建立起来的公社贸易市场，大大增加了上市的商品品种和数量，交易十分活跃。普宁县流沙公社在4月26日举行第一次墟期，上市的商品包括蛋品、牛乳片、水果、蔬菜、鱼产品、燃料和种籽、种苗、小农具、小家具以及百货日用品等九百六十五种，比建立市场前品种增加六十倍。一些修补摊子也摆出来了。半天当中，市场成交额就达七千五百多元。据普宁县各公社市场5月上旬统计，上市商品达四千三百种，销售总额达十八万多元。群众从市场上买到了一些生活需用品，许多工厂也买到了一部分原料。在增城县派谭公社5月13日的第一个墟期上，鸡、鸭、鹅、鸡蛋、大头菜、蔬菜等满街都是。潮阳县的谷饶公社市场，第一个墟期上市商品七十多种，到第七个墟期就增加到四百多种。
    公社贸易市场的建立大大激发了公社、生产队和社员个人的副业生产积极性。许多社员利用业余时间捕猎、采捞各种野生动物、植物或制作各种零星商品，为公社、生产队积累了一部分生产资金，本人也增加了收入。揭阳县棉湖公社新湖大队在第一个墟期的前四天，发动社员搞副业生产，生产产值达三千四百九十元。普宁县惠城公社东陇大队在建立公社市场后的十天内，社员就养鸡九千只，平均每人养一点八只。合山公社第一生产队一次发动社员上山采摘野生植物，加工后在市场出售，收入现金八百多元。
    国营商业部门的购销业务也扩大了。揭阳县商业系统在建立公社市场的第一旬（4月下旬）在市场收购到的商品总值二百零六万元，比中旬增加62.4％；销售总额二百七十四万元，比中旬增加228％。由于市场集中交易，管理便利，产销双方在市场上交易时有条不紊，价格也合理，群众普遍表示满意。
