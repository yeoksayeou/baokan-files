(Our dispatch from Guangzhou, June 1st) Shantou Prefecture, Guangdong Province, has mobilized the masses to summarize and promote high-yield experiences centered on rational close planting and launched a large-scale bumper harvest campaign for a late-season yield of one thousand jin of rice and ten thousand jin of sweet potatoes per mu. Over the past month, cadres at all levels and the broad masses have jointly summarized close planting experiences, formulated production increase targets and measures for a yield of one thousand jin of rice or ten thousand jin of sweet potatoes per mu, and carried out early preparations for cultivation. Recently, the first secretaries of the county Party committees, the first secretaries of the commune Party committees, and responsible cadres from key production brigades in all communes of the entire prefecture gathered in Shantou City to organize a bumper harvest competition for the late season between counties and between communes.

Over the past few years, Shantou Prefecture has carried out agricultural technology reforms, and high-yield fields with yields of over one thousand jin of rice or over ten thousand jin of sweet potatoes per mu have emerged one after another. Especially last year, such high-yield fields were everywhere, whether in plains, coastal areas, hills, or mountains, and some were even tens or hundreds of mu of contiguous land. In order to strive for a large-scale bumper harvest in the late season this year, since late April, the entire prefecture, from production teams, communes, counties, to the prefecture, has repeatedly summarized and exchanged and promoted high-yield experiences from previous years, especially last year's late season, from bottom to top and from top to bottom. Subsequently, the CPC Shantou Prefectural Committee convened a cultivation technology conference for late-season food crops in Shantou Prefecture, attended by agricultural responsible cadres, technicians, and peasant representatives at all levels. Based on the high-yield experiences initially provided by various regions and with reference to current conditions, a technical regulation for late-season rice and sweet potatoes was drafted. Subsequently, at all levels, from counties and communes to production teams, throughout the region, forums, representative meetings, or mass meetings involving veteran farmers and middle-aged and young commune members were held to comprehensively and specifically discuss measures to strive for a bumper harvest in the local late season, especially the specifications for close planting, with reference to this technical regulation. For example, the Chihu Production Brigade of the Fengxi Commune in Chao'an County first reported various types of high-yield fields under different conditions as "pace-setter" fields. Cadres and the masses jointly analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the production measures of these "pace-setter" fields, what could be learned, and what should be improved. Then, the general fields were lined up with the "pace-setter" fields, and a competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the "pace-setter" was launched, resulting in the formulation of large-area bumper harvest targets and measures. The masses praised such targets and measures as both advanced and practical and achievable.

Through extensive and in-depth summary, Shantou Prefecture has basically reached a common conclusion on the experience of rational close planting. That is: each mu of rice should be controlled on the basis of a certain number of panicles, striving for large and full panicles; each mu of sweet potatoes should also be controlled on the basis of a certain number of plants, striving for multiple and large tubers. Experience has shown that, according to the current seed varieties and technical level in Shantou Prefecture, the number of late-season rice panicles should be controlled at around 300,000 per mu, and the number of late-season sweet potato plants should be controlled between 3,000 and 4,000 per mu. In this way, as long as other technical measures are well coordinated, a large-area bumper harvest of over 1,000 jin of rice or over 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu can be achieved. Even fields with relatively poor soil and sunshine conditions can strive for a yield of 500 to 600 jin of rice or 4,000 to 5,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. However, if the planting is too dense or too sparse, such high yields cannot be achieved due to insufficient nutrition and failure to fully utilize the available space and land fertility. According to the principle of "fully mobilizing the masses and testing everything through experiments," various localities throughout the region are actively learning and promoting the summarized close planting experience and determining the planting specifications for local late-season rice and sweet potatoes according to the principle of adapting to local conditions.

According to the deployment of the CPC Shantou Prefectural Committee, the large-area bumper harvest movement for 1,000-jin rice and 10,000-jin sweet potatoes in the late season in Shantou Prefecture requires, in addition to a small amount of cadre experimental fields, grasping both the large-area bumper harvest fields and eliminating low-yield fields, in order to achieve comprehensive and balanced production increase. According to the plan, half of the 5.2 million mu of late rice and 2 million mu of sweet potatoes that should be sown throughout the prefecture are designated as high-yield fields for 1,000-jin rice and 10,000-jin sweet potatoes, while the remaining rice fields are required to yield between 500 jin and 1,000 jin per mu, and the remaining sweet potato fields are also required to yield between 2,000 jin and 10,000 jin per mu. Achieving these late-season targets, plus the grain from the early season that is about to be harvested, will increase this year's grain output by 40% to 50% compared to last year.

In terms of late-season preparation for cultivation, all communes and production brigades have focused on three aspects: First, universally organizing professional teams specifically responsible for sowing, selecting seedlings, and cultivating strong rice and sweet potato seedlings; second, ensuring a longer growing period for late rice and sweet potatoes, starting sowing and seedling cultivation one season earlier than last year, and preparing to plant as soon as the summer harvest is completed; and third, focusing especially on fertilizer to ensure sufficient nutrition for the entire growth and development process of late rice and sweet potatoes. The CPC Shantou Prefectural Committee has promptly put forward the slogan of "fertilizer in command" and quickly organized nearly 800,000 laborers to carry out a fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer production, and fertilizer planting campaign.

### 干部群众会商合理密植大计  汕头专区总结经验制定措施展开千斤稻万斤薯竞赛

    干部群众会商合理密植大计
    汕头专区总结经验制定措施展开千斤稻万斤薯竞赛
    本报广州1日电　广东省汕头专区发动群众总结和推广以合理密植为中心的高产经验，开展一个晚造亩产千斤水稻、万斤甘薯的大面积丰产运动。一个多月来各级干部和广大群众共同总结出密植经验，制定了亩产千斤水稻或万斤甘薯的增产指标和措施，并提早进行了备耕工作。最近，全专区的县委第一书记、公社党委第一书记以及各公社重点生产大队负责干部在汕头市集会，组织了县与县、公社与公社之间的晚造丰产大竞赛。
    汕头专区几年来进行农业技术改革，先后出现了许多亩产水稻一千斤以上或甘薯一万斤以上的高产田。特别是去年，这样的高产田，不论在平原、滨海、丘陵或山区到处都是，甚至有些是几十亩、上百亩成片成片的。为了争取今年晚造大面积丰产，4月下旬以来，全专区从生产大队、公社、县到专区，由下而上又由上而下，反复地逐层总结和交流推广历年来特别是去年晚造的高产经验，接着中共汕头地委召开了由各级农业负责干部、技术人员、农民代表参加的汕头专区晚造粮食作物栽培技术会议，根据各地初步提供的高产经验，和参照目前的条件，草拟出晚造水稻、甘薯的技术规程。接着，全区各县各公社以至生产大队，层层召开包括老农和中年、青年社员参加的座谈会、代表会或群众大会，参考这个技术规程，全面而具体地商定了争取本地晚造丰产的措施，特别是密植的规格。例如潮安县枫溪公社池湖生产大队，先报出各种不同条件不同类型的高产田作为“标兵”田，由干部、群众共同分析这些
  “标兵”田的生产措施有什么优点、缺点，哪些可以学习，哪些应该改进；然后，把一般田跟“标兵”田排起队来，提出向“标兵”看齐，掀起赶“标兵”、超“标兵”的竞赛，结果制订出大面积的丰产指标和措施。群众称赞这样的指标和措施既先进又落实，是能够做到的。
    汕头专区经过广泛深入的总结，目前对合理密植的经验，已经从基本上得到一条共同的结论。这就是：每亩水稻应控制在一定穗数的基础上，力求穗大粒饱；每亩甘薯也应控制在一定株数的基础上，力求薯块多而大。经验证明，根据汕头专区现有的种子品种和技术水平，晚稻每亩控制在三十万穗左右，晚甘薯每亩控制在三千株到四千株之间。这样，只要其它各项技术措施很好地配合上去，就能够夺取亩产水稻一千斤以上或甘薯一万斤以上的大面积丰产。即使土壤、阳光等条件比较差的田地，也可争取亩产水稻五、六百斤，甘薯四、五千斤。但是，如果种植过密或过疏，就会因为得不到适当的营养和充分利用空闲、地力，而不能达到那样的高产。根据“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的原则，目前全区各地正在积极学习和推广总结出的密植经验，并且根据因地制宜的原则，确定当地晚造水稻和甘薯的插植规格。
    按照中共汕头地委的部署，汕头专区晚造千斤水稻、万斤甘薯大面积丰产运动，要求除了搞小量的干部试验田以外，一手抓好大面积丰产片，一手抓紧消灭低产田，以求得全面平衡增产。据规划，全专区应播种的五百二十万亩晚稻和二百万亩甘薯，各有一半被划为千斤水稻、万斤甘薯丰产片，其余的水稻田要求分别亩产五百斤以上到一千斤以下；其余的甘薯田也要求分别亩产二千斤以上到一万斤以下。实现晚造这些指标，加上早造即将收获的粮食，今年的粮食产量比去年可增长40％到50％。
    在晚造备耕工作方面，各公社各生产大队都抓了三条：一是普遍组织专业队伍专门负责播种、选苗，育壮秧苗和薯苗；二是保证晚稻和晚甘薯有较长的生长期，普遍比去年提早一个节令开始播种、育苗，并准备夏收时随收随种；三是特别大抓肥料，以保证晚稻和晚甘薯整个生长发育过程中有足够的营养。中共汕头地委已经及时提出了“肥料挂帅”的口号，迅速组织了近八十万劳力，开展积肥、制肥、种肥运动。（附图片）
