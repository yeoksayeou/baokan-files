    Industrial Common Sense
    There are several methods of steelmaking, including crucible, open hearth, electric furnace, and converter. Among them, converter steelmaking is a method of steelmaking that does not require external fuel, and therefore, it is also the most economical steelmaking method.
    There are two types of converter steelmaking, one is called basic converter, and the other is called acid converter. The difference is: the basic converter uses basic refractory materials for the furnace lining; the acid converter uses acidic refractory materials for the furnace lining. Basic refractory materials include several types such as magnesite and dolomite; acidic refractory materials include silica bricks and silica sand.
    There are some differences in the operation of basic converters and acid converters. In basic converter blowing, a certain amount of lime, fluorite, and iron oxide scale are added. The purpose is to remove phosphorus and sulfur contained in the molten iron. Phosphorus and sulfur are neutralized with lime and become calcium phosphate and calcium sulfide, which enter the steel slag. In this way, the phosphorus and sulfur in the steel are greatly reduced, and the mechanical strength of the steel is greatly increased, making it easier to produce good steel. If the molten iron does not contain much sulfur and phosphorus, a basic converter may not be used, and acid converter steelmaking can be used. It is also necessary to add slag-forming materials such as lime and fluorite. The operation is relatively convenient, and very good steel can also be produced.
    Whether to use acid converter or basic converter steelmaking mainly depends on the amount of sulfur and phosphorus contained in the pig iron.

    碱性转炉和酸性转炉
    炼钢的方法有坩锅、平炉、电炉和转炉多种。其中转炉炼钢是一种不需外来燃料的炼钢方法，因此，也是一种最经济的炼钢方法。
    转炉炼钢有两种，一种叫碱性转炉，一种叫酸性转炉。它的区别是：碱性转炉用碱性的耐火材料做炉衬；酸性转炉用酸性耐火材料做炉衬。碱性耐火材料有镁砂、白云石等数种；酸性耐火材料有矽石砖、泡沙石等。
    碱性转炉和酸性转炉在操作上有一些区别。碱性转炉在吹炼中要加入一定数量的石灰、萤石和氧化铁皮等。目的是去除铁水中所含的磷硫，磷硫与石灰中和，变成磷酸钙和硫化钙并进入钢渣中，这样，钢中磷硫大为降低，钢的机械强度大为增高，便于炼出好钢。如果铁水含硫磷不多，就可以不采用碱性转炉，而用酸性转炉炼钢，也需要加入石灰、萤石等造渣材料，操作比较方便，亦可炼出很好的钢。
    采用酸性转炉还是碱性转炉炼钢，主要根据生铁含硫磷的多少决定。
