Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 25th: After the confluence of the West River and North River flood peaks, the water has passed through the Pearl River Delta river network area and flowed into the sea this morning. The flood threat to Guangzhou City has been basically lifted. However, due to the backing effect of the South China Sea tide on the flood peak, the water levels of the West River below Gaoyao, the North River below Qingyuan, including the Pearl River Delta, all the way to the coast, both in the main streams and tributaries, are falling very slowly. The people on all the dikes in the Pearl River Delta river network area and along the West River and North River are continuing to hold the dikes firmly and fighting fiercely against the flood. As of 5:00 PM today, no accidents have occurred on the West River and North River dikes. The dikes in the Pearl River Delta river network area are being held firmly. Only one medium-sized dike and one small-sized dike have collapsed and been submerged. Efforts are being made to rescue the victims.

After the West River and North River flood peaks converged at Sixian? in Sanshui yesterday morning, they pressed towards the Pearl River Delta at a flow rate of 43,500 cubic meters per second. After the flood peak entered the sea this morning, the water levels of the rivers in the Pearl River Delta river network area and the West River and North River near the delta have slightly decreased. The water level in Gaoyao City on the West River was 11.09 meters at 8:00 AM this morning, a decrease of 0.26 meters from yesterday morning. The water level in Qingyuan City on the North River was 12.49 meters at 8:00 AM this morning, a decrease of 0.57 meters from yesterday morning. Therefore, the flood threat to all the dikes in the Pearl River Delta river network area, especially the dikes along the West River and North River near the delta, has been slightly reduced, and the flood threat to Guangzhou City has been basically lifted. However, because it has rained continuously in the upper and middle reaches of the West River and North River for four days since the 21st, the tail of the flood peak is very long, and the flood is backed by the South China Sea tide, the flood level is falling very slowly. Near Gaoyao City, about 200 kilometers from the coast, the West River flood level is still 0.28 meters higher than on the 22nd (10.81 meters) before the flood peak arrived, and 2.09 meters higher than the warning level. On the North River, Qingyuan City, about 200 kilometers from the coast, still had a water level this morning that was 1.86 meters higher than before the flood peak arrived on the 22nd (10.63 meters), and 0.49 meters higher than the warning level. In the Pearl River Delta river network area, the Sangyuan Dike in Fanshun County, which is representative of water level changes, rose to 5.53 meters when the flood peak passed at 0:00 today. After twelve hours, by 12:00 today, the water level had only dropped by 0.1 meters. That is to say, the river channels within a range of several hundred kilometers from the South China Sea coast to Gaoyao City on the West River and Qingyuan City on the North River are filled with raging floods.

When the flood peak pressed towards the Pearl River Delta river network area, many dikes there experienced dangerous situations such as seepage and slope collapse. The flood-fighting army immediately launched a tense rescue operation. Important dangerous sections that occurred yesterday afternoon, such as the Guzhen section of the Zhongshun Dike at the junction of Zhongshan and Fanshun counties, had a slope collapse of six zhang. It has been rescued from danger after 15,000 people worked overnight. At the Zhabei section of the Sangyuan Dike in Fanshun County, 150 meters of the dike were only 5 centimeters away from being submerged yesterday afternoon. It has been rescued after more than 300 people worked overnight to reinforce it. The Chengnan Dike in Gaohe County was rescued by 30,000 people after a 5-meter breach yesterday afternoon. From last night to this morning, many dikes in the Pearl River Delta continued to show dangerous signs. Among them, slope collapse was the most serious. There were more than 100 slope collapses in Gaohe County. There was a 160-meter slope collapse on the dikes of Sanzhou Dike, and the situation was critical. Emergency measures have now been taken to rescue it. There were seven slope collapses in Fanshun County. Five of them have been repaired, and the other two are being rescued.

As of 5:00 PM today, among the 187 large and medium-sized dikes with more than 10,000 mu in the Pearl River Delta river network area, only the Nantieding Dike in Nanhai County collapsed and was submerged at 11:00 PM last night. This dike contained more than 20,000 mu of farmland and a population of 40,000. Before the dike collapsed at 11:00 PM last night, more than 29,000 people had been evacuated. The population of the seven production teams (a total of 11,000 people) trapped by the flood after the dike collapsed, the population of five production teams has been rescued. Currently, the victims of the remaining two production teams are being rescued. Except for the Lianhe Dike in Gaohe County, which collapsed and was abandoned, the remaining dikes below 10,000 mu in the Pearl River Delta are being firmly defended.

As of 5:00 PM today, the flood outside the large and small dikes in the Pearl River Delta river network area was three to four meters higher than the ground inside the dikes. In addition, the flood resistance of the dikes has been relatively weakened after being submerged for a long time. Therefore, there is still a danger of breaches and collapses. Faced with this situation, the people of all dikes have responded to the call of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Foshan Prefectural Party Committee issued last night to strengthen the flood control struggle, and are determined to fight the flood to the end.

    西江北江洪峰汇合后下泄入海
    广州基本解除洪水威胁
    珠江三角洲河网地带人民继续同洪水激战
    据新华社广州25日电　西江、北江洪峰汇合以后，已经通过珠江三角洲河网地带，在今晨入海。洪水对广州市的威胁已经基本解除。但是，由于洪峰受南海大潮顶托，西江高要以下，北江清远以下，包括珠江三角洲，直到海岸、干流和支流的水位下降都很慢。珠江三角洲河网地带各堤围和西江、北江两岸人民，正在继续坚守堤防，和洪水进行激烈搏斗。到今天十七时止，西江、北江大堤没有发生事故，珠江三角洲河网地带的各堤围正在坚守，只有一个中型堤围和一个小型堤围堤崩被淹，正在大力抢救灾民。
    西江、北江的洪峰，昨日早晨在三水思贤?汇合以后，即以四三五○○秒公方的流量压向珠江三角洲。今天早晨洪峰入海后，珠江三角洲河网地带的各江河水位和靠近三角洲的西江、北江水位，已经微微下降。西江高要城今晨八时水位已落到一一·○九公尺，比昨晨下降○·二六公尺，北江清远城今晨八时水位已落到一二·四九公尺，比昨晨下降了○·五七公尺。因此，珠江三角洲河网地区所有堤围，特别是靠近三角洲的西江、北江两岸的堤围，洪水威胁已稍稍减轻，广州市受到的洪水威胁已经基本解除。但是，由于从21日以来的四天内，西江、北江上中游又陆续下雨，洪峰的尾巴拖得很长，又加上洪水受到南海大潮顶托，所以洪水水位下降很慢，距海岸约二百公里的高要城附近，西江洪水水位比洪峰到来以前的22日（一○·八一公尺）还高○·二八公尺，比警戒水位高二·○九公尺。北江方面离海岸约二百公里的清远城，今晨水位仍比22日洪峰来到以前（十·六三公尺）高一·八六公尺，比警戒水位高零·四九公尺。珠江三角洲河网地带水位变化有代表性的番顺县桑园围，今天零时洪峰经过时水位升到五·五三公尺，过了十二小时，到今天十二时，水位只下降了零·一公尺。这就是说，从南海海岸到西江的高要城和北江的清远城，几百公里范围内的江河河道内，都灌满了横冲直撞的滚滚洪水。
    洪峰压向珠江三角洲河网地带时，那里有不少堤围发生了渗漏、塌坡等险情，抗洪大军立即展开了紧张的抢救。昨天下午发生的重要险段，如中山、番顺县交界的中顺大围的古镇段，有六丈塌坡，经一万五千人通宵抢救已经脱险。番顺县的桑园大围闸北段，昨天下午有一百五十公尺堤围，只差五公寸就被漫顶，经三百多人通宵抢修加高后已脱险。高鹤县的城南围昨日下午缺口五公尺后，经三万人抢救，也已脱险。昨天夜间到今日上午，珠江三角洲不少堤围，继续出现险象，其中塌坡最为严重，高鹤县塌坡一百余处，三洲围的堤围有一百六十公尺塌坡，情况危急，现已采取紧急措施进行抢救。番顺县塌坡七处，有五处修好，另二处正在抢救。
    到十七时止，珠江三角洲河网地带一百八十七条一万亩以上的大、中堤围中，只有南海县南铁鼎围在昨晚二十三时堤崩被淹。这个堤围中，有二万多亩农田，四万多人口。昨晚二十三时堤崩以前，已有二万九千多人撤走。堤崩后被洪水围困的七个生产大队（共一万一千人）已有五个大队的人口被救出。现在，正在抢救其余二个大队的灾民。珠江三角洲上万亩以下的小堤围，除高鹤县的联合围崩堤放弃外，其余的堤围都在固守中。
    到今天十七时止，珠江三角洲河网地带的大小堤围外面的洪水，都比堤围内的地面高三到四公尺。再加堤围受浸久了，抗洪能力相对减弱，因此，还继续存在着决口崩堤的危险。面对这种情况，各堤围的人民，都响应广东省委和佛山地委昨晚发出的加强防洪斗争的号召，决心和洪水搏斗到底。（附图片）
