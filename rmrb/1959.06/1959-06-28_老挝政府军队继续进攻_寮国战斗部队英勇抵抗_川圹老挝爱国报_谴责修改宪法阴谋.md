Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 27th: A Khuang report from Laos states: According to the "Khuang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" on the 21st, the Lao Royal Army continues to attack the Laotian Fighting Units. From June 14th to 20th, the Lao Royal Army launched attacks on the Second Battalion of the Laotian Fighting Units in Than Lang, Ba Bian, and Ben So.

The "Khuang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" stated that although the Laotian Fighting Units called on Laotians not to fight Laotians, the commanders of the Royal Army still forced their soldiers to open fire. The Laotian Fighting Units were forced to resist and repelled the attack.

The newspaper also reported that from June 15th to 20th, the Lao Royal Army conducted sweeps in Sang Zhi, Cha Men, Hui Shan, and other places. Local people's self-defense forces fought bravely and eliminated a portion of the Lao Royal Army's active forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 27th: A Khuang report from Laos states: According to the "Khuang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" on June 17th, the Khuang Provincial Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, representing party cadres and people of the entire province, wrote a letter to the Second Battalion of the Laotian Fighting Units, warmly congratulating them on resolutely and bravely repelling multiple attacks by the Royal Army, preserving their strength, and continuing to carry out anti-sweep struggles.

The letter stated: "Your actions are completely correct and in line with justice. You have held high the banner of peace, neutrality, independence, and democracy advocated by the Central Committee of the Patriotic Party and Prince Souphanouvong long ago."

The letter stated: "The people of Khuang are very grateful to the Second Battalion for its battles to defend the people and to counter the Royal Army's sweeps and suppression. The people of Khuang wholeheartedly unite with the Second Battalion, regarding the Second Battalion as their most beloved sons and daughters."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 27th: The "Khuang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" published an editorial on the 21st entitled "Resolutely Oppose the Phoui Sananikone-Kou Voravong Group's Conspiracy to Amend the Constitution." The editorial stated that the Phoui Sananikone-Kou Voravong group's purpose in amending the constitution is to conspire to replace the current constitution with a reactionary constitution, to conspire to abolish all democratic freedoms that the Lao people have won with much bloodshed, and to hold fraudulent elections to exclude representatives of the Lao Patriotic Party, peaceful neutral forces, and other patriotic members of parliament from the National Assembly, in order to form a National Assembly according to their own wishes and establish a dictatorial system in Laos.

The editorial called on the people of the entire country to unite, cut off the tentacles of American imperialist intervention, and stop the Phoui Sananikone-Kou Voravong group's traitorous conspiracy. The editorial also demanded that the Lao government solemnly fulfill the Geneva Accords and all agreements it has previously signed with the Lao Patriotic Party, and establish a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, and prosperous Laos.

    “川圹老挝爱国报”说，虽然寮国战斗部队呼吁老挝人不要打老挝人，但是王国军队的指挥官仍然迫使他们的士兵开枪。寮国战斗部队被迫抵抗，并且打退了这次进攻。
    这家报纸还报道，从6月15日到20日老挝王国军队在桑椥、茶门、会山等地进行了扫荡。当地人民的自卫队进行了英勇的战斗，并且消灭了老挝王国军队的一部分有生力量。
    新华社河内27日电　老挝川圹消息：据“川圹老挝爱国报”6月17日报道，老挝爱国党川圹省省委会代表全省党的干部和人民写信给寮国战斗部队第二营，热烈祝贺他们以坚决和英勇的战斗打退了王国军队的多次进攻，保全了力量，并且正在继续进行反扫荡斗争。
    信中说：“你们的行动是完全正确和符合正义的，你们高举了爱国党中央委员会和苏发努冯亲王很久以前就提倡的和平中立、独立、民主的旗帜。”
    信中说：“川圹同胞们非常感谢第二营为保卫人民、为对付王国军队的扫荡和镇压而进行的战斗。川圹人民全心全意地同第二营团结在一起，把第二营当作是自己最敬爱的儿女。”

    社论号召全国人民团结起来，砍断美帝国主义干涉的魔爪，制止培·萨纳尼空—卡代集团的卖国阴谋。社论还要求老挝政府严正地履行日内瓦协议和它同老挝爱国党之间过去所签订的一切协议，建立一个和平、中立、独立、民主和繁荣的老挝。
