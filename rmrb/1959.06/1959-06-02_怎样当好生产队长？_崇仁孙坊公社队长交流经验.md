How to Be a Good Production Team Leader?
Sunfang Commune, Chongren, Exchanges Experience
Nanchang, June 1st (Report from our newspaper) To lead this year's great leap forward in production, the production team leader, who directly organizes the labor of commune members, bears a major responsibility. To this end, the Sunfang People's Commune in Chongren County, Jiangxi Province, recently convened a forum of production team leaders to summarize the experience of being a good production team leader.

Twelve production team leaders participated in the forum. They first affirmed that the most important thing to be a good production team leader is to adhere to collective leadership and follow the mass line. Zeng Biao Sun, of the Cuijia Production Team, used his personal experience to confirm this point. He said: "The production of our team has now improved, increasing from more than 300 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu more than ten days ago to more than 600 dan. The spring-ripening crops are also growing very well. The cadres and commune members are very enthusiastic. The reason is that we have brought into play collective leadership and relied on everyone's wisdom. Our team has more than 40 households and more than 130 people. In the previous stage, I was in charge alone. The commune members' eating, living, production, leave, and all the small things had to come to me. I took care of the east, but I couldn't take care of the west. Once, I went to the commune for two days of meetings, and no one at home made arrangements. More than 20 mu of safflower grass fields were not properly ditched, and as a result, the rain rotted the safflower grass seeds. After this lesson, I started to engage the team's cadres, discuss everything with them, and promote democracy to make production arrangements. In arranging production, I mobilized the commune members to come up with ideas. In this way, what I couldn't think of, they thought of. If I left, they would arrange things themselves, and production would continue in an orderly manner."

How to arrange production? Everyone unanimously affirmed that the production team leader should grasp long-term plans and short-term arrangements. Zhou Jinjing, the production team leader of Miaoshang, cited the situation before and after his team grasped long-term plans and short-term arrangements. In the previous stage, there was no production plan, and there was a phenomenon of low labor efficiency, and no one was responsible for some things. The party branch secretary of the brigade helped them formulate a production plan and implement "four fixings" (land, labor, cattle, and farm tools) to the group. On this basis, they also did a good job of "five to the piece" for crops, targets, fertilizers, measures, and responsibilities. Operate according to the "five to the piece" plan and assign special personnel for management. Through these measures, the team leaders and commune members all had a bottom line in their minds about production. The production team leader of Yuejiazhou introduced their experience in short-term arrangements. After studying the long-term plan with the commune members recently, this team also made short-term work arrangements. First, find out the bottom line of the team's farm work, distinguish between the importance and urgency, and calculate the farm work projects, locations, completion time, work points, and who will do it, arranging it to the group and to the individual for five or ten days. Then, according to the specialties of each commune member, divide the work. After the arrangements are made, also implement "three guarantees" (task, quality, time) and promote simple work quotas, recording work points by piece. After doing this, everyone does things according to plan, in an organized manner, and production efficiency is greatly improved.

In the summary, everyone also unanimously felt that if the team leader wants to lead a team well, he must participate in production no matter what, take the lead in everything, and set an example. Production team leader Ouyang Linxiang said: "In the previous stage, I was held back by some big and small things, and I participated less in production. Problems could not be discovered, and the work was not done well. I was rated as a third-class team. Later, according to the instructions of the commune, I engaged in experimental fields and became one with the commune members. I took the lead in production, and the work immediately improved. At the end of February, the Party committee proposed that fertilizer should take the lead. Some commune members said that there was no fertilizer to accumulate. The next day, the party branch secretary of the brigade and several cadres of the team took the lead, and more than 40 commune members accumulated 40,000 dan of turf fertilizer in five days. This time, we were rated as a red flag team. Facts have proved that to do a good job, we must personally participate in production and lead production."

In addition, everyone believed that the team leader should care about the lives of the commune members; everyone also believed that to be a good production team leader, one must listen to the Party and resolutely implement the Party's policies.

Now, the production team leaders of Sunfang Commune are promoting and applying these experiences.

    怎样当好生产队长？
    崇仁孙坊公社队长交流经验
    本报南昌1日电　领导好今年的生产大跃进，直接组织社员劳动的生产队长负有重大责任。为此，江西崇仁县孙坊人民公社最近召集生产队长开座谈会，总结当好生产队长的经验。
    参加座谈的是十二个生产队长。他们首先肯定：当好生产队长最重要的一条是坚持集体领导和走群众路线。崔家生产队曾标孙用他的亲身体会证实这一点。他说：“我们这个队的生产，如今搞得有了起色，由十多天前每亩积肥三百多担增加到六百多担，春熟作物也长得很好，干部、社员干劲都很大，原因就是发挥了集体领导、依靠了大家的智慧。我这个队有四十多户，一百三十多口人。前段由我一个人抓，社员吃、住、生产、请假等，所有零碎事都要找我，顾了东，又顾不了西。有一次我到公社开了两天会，家里就没有人安排，二十多亩红花草田没有开好沟，结果落了雨红花草子被浸坏了。得了这次教训，以后我就把队里干部抓起来，事事和他们商量，发扬民主，做出生产安排。在安排生产中，发动社员出主意。这样，我想不到的，他们想到了。我离开了，他们自己也会安排，生产照常有秩序地进行。”
    如何安排生产？大家一致肯定，生产队长要抓好长计划、短安排。庙上生产队长周金经举出了他队里抓长计划、短安排前后的情况。在前一段没有订出生产计划，出现劳动效率低的现象，有的事情无人负责。大队党支书帮助他们制订了生产规划，实行“四固定”（土地、劳力、耕牛、农具）到组。在这个基础上，又搞好作物、指标、肥料、措施、责任“五到片”。根据“五到片”计划进行操作，并确定专人管理。通过这些措施，队长、社员对生产心中都有了底。岳家州生产队长介绍了他们短安排的经验。这个队最近与社员一同研究长计划之后，又搞了短期排工。首先将一队的农活摸清底子，分别轻重缓急，计算出农活项目、地点、完成时间、工分、谁去做，五天或十天安排到组到人。然后按照每个社员的特长分工。安排好以后，还实行“三包”（任务、质量、时间）和推行简单的工作定额，按件记工分。这样做以后，大家都按计划办事，有头有绪，生产效率大大提高。
    在总结中，大家还一致感到，队长要领导好一个队，无论如何要参加生产，事事带头，作出榜样。生产队长欧阳林祥说：“前一段我被一些大小事情牵住了，生产参加少，问题不能发现，工作搞得不好，被评为第三类队。后来我按照公社的指示，搞了试验田，与社员打成一片，生产带头，工作立即有了起色。2月底，党委提出肥料挂帅，有些社员说无肥可积。第二天，由大队党支部书记和队内几个干部带头，四十多个社员，五天中积了四万担草皮肥。这次被评为红旗队。事实证明，要搞好工作，必须亲自参加生产，领导生产。”
    此外，大家认为当队长要关心社员生活；大家还认为，当好生产队长要听党的话，要坚决执行党的政策。
    现在，孙坊公社各个生产队长都在推广运用这些经验。
