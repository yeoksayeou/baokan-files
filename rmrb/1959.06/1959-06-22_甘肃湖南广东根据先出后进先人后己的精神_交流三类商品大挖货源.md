Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 21st: Gansu Province held a provincial third category commodity exchange meeting from the 14th to the 19th.

    At the meeting, after understanding the production and sales situation of more than 3,000 kinds of third category commodities in the province, representatives from various regions, in the spirit of mutual cooperation and support, compressed their own requisition plans and increased the quantity and variety of supplies, and arranged for the production of third category commodities. The total value of requisition plans from various regions was reduced by 11% compared to the original, and the total value of supply plans increased by 3.8 times. Representatives from commercial departments and 254 communes in various regions signed production and sales contracts at the meeting, arranging for the production of more than 470 kinds of third category commodities, including wild animals and plants, mineral products, various local and special products, non-staple foods, and daily necessities, with a total value of more than 110 million yuan. More than 50 kinds of commodities that had been suspended will also resume production. On the basis of arranging production, the conference carried out exchange activities. The total transaction volume of third category commodity purchase and sale agreements signed between various special districts, counties, and cities in the province alone reached more than 130 million yuan, including more than 3.2 million yuan in spot goods.
    In order to ensure the successful completion of the production and purchase and sale plans for third category commodities, the conference required all communes and commercial departments in the province to further implement the policy of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production, and to develop diversified operations. The third category commodities produced by the communes should first complete the task of transferring goods according to the contracts, and the rest should be distributed and used by the communes themselves. The purchase of rural sideline products must implement the principle of grading and pricing according to quality, and of paying higher prices for better quality.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 21st: Hunan Province held its first provincial third category commodity exchange conference from the 8th to the 17th of this month. The third category commodity (i.e., commodity materials not included in the state plan, mainly local and special products) transactions carried out by the thirteen delegations composed of commercial, light industry, and health systems from various special districts at the meeting were very active. During the conference, a total of 6,395 contracts and 105 agreements were signed, with a total transaction volume of nearly 100 million yuan.

    One of the important gains of this material exchange conference was the discovery of a large number of goods through exchange. All delegations, based on the communist spirit of cooperation of "prioritizing output, allowing imports later," "prioritizing others, benefiting self later," and starting from the overall situation, explored the potential of local commodity production to meet the needs of fraternal units. For example, as the early rice harvesting season is approaching, all regions need a large number of sickles. The Xiangtan Special District delegation brought out 500,000 sickles at one time and handed them over to the conference for balanced distribution. The Tianlun Paper Mill needs 700,000 dan of rice straw, and the Xiangtan Special District delegation guaranteed to supply the full amount. The Hunan Daily Chemical Factory needs wild oil to produce soap, and the delegations from various special districts signed supply contracts separately. The delegations also signed contracts and agreements with each other for various utensils and miscellaneous items such as round wood utensils, as well as small commodities needed in the market such as sewing machine parts, leather box locks, zippers, and grass paper, and appropriately arranged for production according to needs.
    In addition to the exchange of third category commodities, this conference also further adjusted the inventories of various regions and rationally distributed commodities. For example, representatives from Lingling, Daoxian and other places located in mountainous areas voluntarily transferred more than ten kinds of high-end commodities, such as cameras and textured leather gloves, which were not selling well locally, to the three cities of Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Hengyang.

    During the exchange conference, the transaction of non-staple foods for urban supply and special commodities for foreign trade departments was also very active. The Xiangtan Special District delegation brought out 5,000 dan of soy sauce, spicy bean paste, and ginger at one time to support the needs of other cities. The Hengyang Special District also signed contracts with foreign trade departments for a large number of export commodities such as poisonous snakes, mandarin ducks, golden geese, and thrushes.

    Through this material exchange, the original reasonable supply and sales relationships were restored, and new cooperative relationships were established. In the past, the famous Xiangtan soy sauce, Yongfeng chili sauce, and round wood utensils produced in Changde area all had certain production, sales, and supply relationships; they had been interrupted at one point, but now they have restored their original supply relationships.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st: The representatives from various regions participating in the Guangdong Province Production and Sales Cooperation Material Exchange Conference, after 26 days of exchange activities, signed a large number of purchase and sale contracts for spot and futures third category commodities, with a total transaction volume of more than 156.6 million yuan. This exchange conference ended on the 18th.

    At the exchange conference, the representatives of various regions, through their efforts, restored many of the original reasonable supply and sales relationships and established new cooperative relationships. The Shantou Special District alone restored 132 original supply and sales relationships and established 186 new cooperative relationships, including the supply of canned food, seafood, roasted gelatin, wild fiber, drawn spinning, rice milling machines, bricks, tiles, and so on.

    This exchange conference also discovered some new sources of goods. For example, the lemongrass residue from Hainan Island was not utilized in the past. At this meeting, the representatives from Hainan Island provided 300,000 tons of lemongrass residue for Guangzhou's paper industry as raw material. In the past, a large number of wild plant earth miscellaneous vines in various places had not found a market. At this meeting, more than 8,000 tons were traded, worth nearly one million yuan. After exploring the potential of goods sources, the Shantou Special District discovered 411 new varieties, including wild fiber, oil, starch, and medicinal materials.

    甘肃湖南广东根据先出后进先人后己的精神
    交流三类商品大挖货源
    据新华社兰州21日电　甘肃省在14日到19日召开了全省第三类商品交流会。
    会上，各地区的代表，在了解了全省三千多种三类商品的产销情况以后，本着互相协作支援的精神，压缩了自己的要货计划，增加了供货的数量和品种，安排了三类商品的生产。各地要货计划总值比原来压缩了11％，供货计划总值增加了三点八倍。各地商业部门代表和二百五十四个公社的代表，在会上签订了产销合同，安排了四百七十多种三类商品的生产，其中包括野生动物植物、矿产品、各种土特产品、副食品和日用品，价值共一亿一千多万元；过去一度停产的五十多种商品，也将恢复生产。大会在安排生产的基础上，开展了交流活动。仅省内各专区、县、市之间签订的三类商品购销协议，成交总额达一亿三千多万元，其中有三百二十多万元的现货。
    大会为了保证三类商品的生产计划和购销计划完满实现，要求全省各公社和商业部门进一步贯彻自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针开展多种经营。各公社生产的三类商品应首先按合同完成上调任务，其余的由公社自行分配使用。对农村副业产品的收购，必须实行分等论价和优质优价。
    据新华社长沙21日电　湖南省在本月8日到17日召开了全省第一次三类商品交流大会。由各专区商业、轻工业、卫生系统组成的十三个代表团，在会上进行的第三类商品（即列入国家计划以外的商品物资，主要是土特产品）交易十分活跃。大会期间共签订了六千三百九十五份合同，一百零五份协议书，成交总额近一亿元。
    这次物资交流大会的重要收获之一，是通过交流挖掘出了大批货源。各代表团都根据先出后进，先人后己，从全局出发的共产主义协作精神，发掘本地商品生产潜力，适应兄弟单位的需要。如目前快到早稻收割季节，各地都需要大批镰刀，湘潭专区代表团一次就拿出了五十万把，交大会平衡分配；天伦造纸厂需要七十万担稻草，湘潭专区代表团保证如数供应；湖南日用化工厂需要野生油料生产肥皂，各专区代表团都分别签订了供应合同。人民日常生活需要的圆木器等各种用具和杂品，以及像缝纫机零件、皮箱锁、拉链、草纸等市场需要的小商品，各代表团都互相签订了合同和协议，根据需要，适当地安排了生产。
    这次大会除了进行第三类商品的交流以外，同时也进一步调剂了各地的库存，合理地分配了商品。如地处山区的零陵、道县等地的代表、主动将本地销路不大的照相机、纹皮手套等十多种高级商品，调剂给长沙、株洲、衡阳三个市。
    交流大会期间，供应城市副食品、供应对外贸易部门的特种商品的交易，也很活跃。湘潭专区代表团一次拿出酱油、辣豆酱、生姜共五千担，支援其他城市的需要；衡阳专区也以大批毒蛇、鸳鸯、金雁、画眉鸟等出口商品，同外贸部门签订了合同。
    通过这次物资交流，还恢复了原有合理的供销关系，并且建立了新的协作关系。过去，全省著名的湘潭酱油，永丰辣椒酱，常德地区生产的圆木器，都有一定的产销供应关系；后来曾经一度中断过，现在都恢复了原来的供应关系。
    据新华社广州21日电　参加广东省产销协作物资交流会的各地代表，经过二十六天的交流活动，签订了大批现货、期货的三类商品购销合同，成交总额共一亿五千六百多万元。这次交流会已在18日结束。
    在交流会上，各地代表经过努力，恢复了不少原有的合理供销关系，建立了新的协作关系。仅汕头专区就恢复原有的供销关系一百三十二宗，建立新协作关系一百八十六宗，其中包括供应罐头、海产品、烤胶、野生纤维、抽纺、碾米机、砖瓦等等。
    这次交流会还发掘了一些新的货源。例如海南岛的香茅草渣过去没有利用，在这次会上海南岛的代表提供了三十万吨香茅草渣，给广州造纸工业作原料。过去各地有大批野生植物土杂藤没有找到市场，在这次会上成交了八千多吨，价值近一百万元。汕头专区经过挖掘货源潜力后，发掘了包括野生纤维、油料、淀粉、药材等新品种四百一十一种。
