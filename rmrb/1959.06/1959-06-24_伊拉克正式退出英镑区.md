Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 23rd. Ayub, Director of the Iraqi Information and National Guidance Department, announced at midnight on the 22nd that Iraq had formally withdrawn from the Sterling Area.

Ayub stated in a statement that the results of the talks held in Baghdad with Britain affirmed Iraq's right to monetary independence and ended its membership in the Sterling Area.

A joint communiqué issued by the British and Iraqi governments stated: "The representatives of the Iraqi government informed the representatives of the government of the United Kingdom that the Iraqi government had decided to no longer be a member of the Sterling Area and to diversify Iraq's monetary reserves and foreign trade balances. The Government of the United Kingdom agrees to amend the exchange control regulations accordingly, including changing Iraq's sterling accounts to external accounts from this day forward, in accordance with the aforementioned decision." A statement issued by the Iraqi Ministry of Finance stated that, as a result of withdrawing from the Sterling Area, "Iraq is now free to use its foreign exchange reserves in any way it deems to be in its own interests, whether it be new revenue in sterling and other currencies earned through oil extraction or other exports. This accumulated sum now accounts for a large part of Iraq's monetary margin and constitutes the largest part of Iraq's foreign exchange reserves."

The statement also announced: As of May 31, the sterling assets of the Central Bank of Iraq were 98,253,000 pounds, and as of the same date, the sterling assets of some commercial banks were 14,436,000 pounds, while oil revenue from 1959 to 1960 is estimated at 100 million pounds.

    伊拉克正式退出英镑区
    新华社巴格达23日电　伊拉克宣传与国家指导处处长阿尤布22日午夜宣布，伊拉克正式退出英镑区。
    阿尤布发表声明说，在巴格达同英国举行会谈的结果，肯定了伊拉克有权在货币方面独立，并结束它在英镑区的成员国资格。
    英国和伊拉克两国政府发表的联合公报说：“伊拉克政府代表通知联合王国政府的代表：伊拉克政府决定不再当英镑区的成员，并且要使伊拉克的货币储备和对外贸易余额多样化。联合王国政府同意根据上述决定相应地修改汇兑管制条例，包括从这一天起把伊拉克的英镑账户改为对外账户。”伊拉克财政部发表的一个说明称：由于退出了英镑区，“伊拉克已可以自由地按照它认为符合自己利益的任何方式来使用外汇储备，不论它是通过开采石油或是通过其他出口所获得的英镑和其他货币的新收入。这笔积累的数目现在占伊拉克货币保证金中很大一部分，它构成伊拉克外汇储备中的最大部分。”
    这个说明还宣布：到5月31日为止，伊拉克中央银行的英镑资产为九千八百二十五万三千英镑，到同一个日期，一些商业银行的英镑资产为一千四百四十三万六千英镑，而从1959年到1960年的石油收入估计为一亿英镑。
