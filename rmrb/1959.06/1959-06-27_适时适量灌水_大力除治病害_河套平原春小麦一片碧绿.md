Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 26th: The Hetao Irrigation Area in Inner Mongolia is vigorously promoting the advanced irrigation method of "shallow watering, quick rotation, and economical water use" this year, and the quality of irrigation work has significantly improved. More than 1.2 million mu of spring wheat, which has been watered appropriately and on time twice, is currently growing verdant green, and the wheat seedlings are better than in previous years.

The Yellow River Houtao Irrigation Area has had abundant harvests for many years. Since the beginning of spring this year, farmers of all ethnic groups have launched even larger-scale water conservancy projects, carrying out spring water conservancy movements with canal maintenance and land leveling as the main content. After this movement, the five major irrigation areas of the irrigation district successively released water for irrigation in mid-May. At the same time, since the people's communes, before sowing spring wheat, separately cultivated various wheat fields into ridge fields of one mu or less to three mu or more, and excavated more than 51,000 agricultural canals and small canals, the wheat fields received rational irrigation with "shallow watering and quick rotation." In the past, due to uneven ground, backward methods of "deep watering and flooding" were often adopted here.

The widespread implementation of the quota-based contract watering method this year is also an important measure to realize "shallow watering, quick rotation, and economical water use." At present, many people's communes have selected strong laborers with experience in water conservancy and irrigation to form contract watering groups or water conservancy professional teams to carry out contract watering work according to quality, quantity, and time. Based on the fact that wheat fields were densely planted, heavily fertilized, and deeply plowed this year, they generally watered once more than in previous years and appropriately increased the amount of irrigation water, achieving timely and appropriate irrigation. In the first three days after the second watering this year, spring wheat grew an average of about four centimeters per day. The number of first-class wheat seedlings in many areas increased by about 20% compared with previous years, and the number of third-class wheat seedlings decreased by 15%. Currently, most wheat fields are being watered for the third time, and a few wheat fields will be watered for the fourth time, which is an unprecedented scene in the history of Hetao irrigation.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 26th: People of all ethnic groups on the Hetao Plain in Inner Mongolia have achieved success in preventing and controlling wheat rust. More than 1.2 million mu of spring wheat are currently growing rapidly under the protection of an army of more than 80,000 rust-killing and pest-controlling personnel.

This year, the spring wheat on the Hetao Plain in Bayannur League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is growing very luxuriantly due to the good deep plowing, dense planting, and irrigation work. Recently, due to the gradual increase in temperature and humidity, wheat rust and other diseases and insect pests have occurred in various banners and counties. Under the slogan of "Do not let rust disease pass June, and vow to win a bumper wheat harvest," the Party and government leading organs and people's communes at all levels in Bayannur League launched a mass prevention and control and encirclement and suppression movement against wheat rust and other diseases from mid-June. More than 80,000 rust-killing and pest-controlling personnel are spraying various native pesticides on wheat fields infected with rust day and night. At present, more than 121,000 mu of wheat fields have been sprayed with pesticides, accounting for 46% of the wheat fields infected with rust. Many wheat fields are being sprayed for the second time after being sprayed for the first time. In many wheat fields that have been sprayed with pesticides, the spread of rust has stopped.

    适时适量灌水　大力除治病害
    河套平原春小麦一片碧绿
    据新华社呼和浩特26日电　内蒙古河套灌区今年大力推行“浅浇快轮，经济用水”的先进灌溉方法，灌溉工作质量显著提高。已经适时适量灌溉过两次水的一百二十多万亩春小麦，目前长得一片碧绿，麦苗比历年都好。
    黄河后套灌区历年丰收。今年入春以来，各族农民更大兴水利工程，开展了以渠道岁修和平地打堰为主要内容的春修水利运动。经过这次运动以后，灌区的五大灌域都先后在5月中旬放水浇青。同时，由于各人民公社在春小麦播种前，分别把各类麦田培修成一亩以下到三亩以上的畦田，开挖出农渠、毛渠五万一千多道，因此麦田得到了“浅浇快轮”的合理灌溉。而过去这里因为地不平整，往往采取“深浇漫灌”的落后方法。
    今年广泛推行定额包浇办法，也是实现“浅浇快轮、经济用水”的一个重要措施。目前，许多人民公社都选出对水利和灌溉有经验的强劳动力，组成包浇小组或水利专业队，按质按量按时地进行包浇工作。他们根据今年麦田播种密、施肥多、翻地深等情况，比往年普遍增浇一次水，并且适当地增加灌水量，作到了适时适量的灌溉。今年浇过二水的头三天中，春小麦几乎每天都平均生长四公分左右。许多地区的一类麦苗约比往年增加了20％，三类麦苗减少了15％。现在大部分麦田正浇灌三水，少数麦田将浇灌四水，这是河套灌溉史上未有的景象。
    据新华社呼和浩特26日电　内蒙古河套平原上的各族人民，防治春小麦锈病获得成效。一百二十多万亩春小麦，目前正在八万多名灭锈治虫大军的保护下迅速成长。
    今年，内蒙古自治区巴彦淖尔盟河套平原上的春小麦，由于深翻密植和灌溉工作做得好，生长十分茂盛。最近因为温度和湿度渐高，小麦锈病和其他病虫害在各旗县都有发生。巴彦淖尔盟的各级党政领导机关和人民公社，在“不让锈病过6月，誓夺小麦大丰收”的口号下，从6月中旬开始，向小麦锈病等发起了群众性的防治和围歼运动，八万多名灭锈治虫大军，日夜地向感染锈病的麦田喷洒各种土农药。现在喷洒过农药的麦田已有十二万一千多亩，占感染锈病麦田的46％。许多麦田喷过头遍后，正喷二遍。受过药剂喷洒的不少麦田，锈病已停止蔓延。
