Xinhua News Agency, 2nd June: During the current busy summer harvest season, all localities are paying great attention to the selection and retention of seeds for summer harvested crops. At present, the work of selecting and retaining seeds is gradually unfolding from south to north.

This year, the selection and retention of seeds for summer harvested crops is being personally overseen by Party committees in many regions. They started early, acted quickly, and the scope of work is relatively broad. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, by mid to late May, the summer seed selection and retention work had been fully launched in most areas of Anhui, Henan, Guizhou, and other provinces, and had also begun in some areas of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, and other provinces. Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan and other provinces, which acted early, made deployments ten to fifteen days earlier than in previous years, at the end of March and the beginning of April. Other provinces also made specific arrangements before mid-May. At present, most of this work has been implemented at the county level, and some at the commune and production team level. Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, gave instructions on seed selection and retention work at a telephone conference. Special districts and counties successively convened seed selection telephone conferences or on-site meetings to make arrangements. Many communes and production teams have organized professional seed selection teams, drafted seed selection tasks, determined seed plots, reasonably stipulated seed selection remuneration, and some have also formulated storage and management systems. By mid-May, the Lu'an Special District had organized more than 10,000 professional teams and prepared more than 7,000 seed warehouses. Lu'an and other seven counties had selected and retained more than 1.65 million catties of improved varieties of barley and rapeseed. The Anqing Special District had also trained more than 10,000 seed selection experts and determined seed plots. In Hebei Province, many communes have fixed full-time personnel to establish seed selection teams and groups, and determine seed selection plots. In order to select and retain sufficient good wheat seeds, the Wenmiao Commune in Jiaocheng County, the commune Party committee, management area, cadres of the production teams, and experienced commune members jointly formed a seed selection team to conduct field inspections, comparisons, and analyses of various wheat seeds introduced locally and from other places. They have selected varieties such as Bima No. 1, which are suitable for local cultivation, as seed retention targets, and have determined more than 5,000 mu of seed fields, which are managed by special personnel to promptly remove diseased and miscellaneous plants, thereby improving the quality and purity of the seeds. The county Party secretary and commune Party secretaries of Renqiu County also conducted field inspections in different areas to determine seed plots. The New Town Township Youth Seed Selection Team in this county also selected 400 single wheat plants with large ears, many grains, and hard stalks for processing and cultivation, preparing for single harvest and single planting for propagation. In Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, the seed selection tasks of more than 20 communes have been assigned to production teams and work groups. A total of more than 7,500 commune and team cadres and commune members have been organized to conduct variety identification in the fields, and determine more than 90,000 mu of seed fields for wheat and rapeseed. Using a combination of individual ear selection and plot selection methods, they plan to select and retain 13 million catties of seeds, and are now harvesting, drying, and storing them. The Communist Youth League organizations at all levels in Yanshi County, Henan Province, are also actively organizing young people to participate in seed selection. At present, 20,000 young people and other commune members have been organized to carry out seed selection work. The ten youth seed selection groups of the Yuetan Brigade of Zhai Town Commune in this county have cultivated 30 seed selection experts through technical training and on-site practice, and have selected 2,000 catties of good seeds from more than 80 mu of seed land.

In order to select, retain, and manage this year's summer harvested crop seeds, the Ministry of Agriculture recently sent four working groups to Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces to assist in the work. The seed selection and retention work in various localities will be further expanded with the progress of the summer harvest.

    南北农民深入田头精挑细选留够留足
    新华社2日讯　在当前繁忙的夏收季节中，各地对夏收作物的选种、留种工作都很重视，目前，选种留种工作正由南向北逐渐展开。
    今年夏收作物的选种、留种工作，很多地区都由党委亲自抓，抓的早，行动的较快，开展的面也比较宽。据农业部了解，到5月中、下旬，夏季选种、留种工作在安徽、河南、贵州等省的大部地区已经全面展开，在浙江、江苏、湖北、河北、山东、陕西等省的部分地区也已经开始了。行动早的云南、四川、湖南等省比往年提早十天到半个月在3月底、4月初就做了部署，其他各省在5月中旬以前也都做了具体安排。目前这一工作多数已落实到县，部分已落实到公社、生产队。中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣曾在电话会议上对选种、留种工作做了指示，各专区、县都相继召开了选种电话会或现场会等进行了安排。许多公社、生产队组织了选种专业队伍，拟定了选种任务，确定了种子地，合理规定了选种报酬，有的还制定了贮藏保管制度。到5月中旬六安专区已组织好专业队一万多个，准备种子仓库七千多间，六安等七个县已选留大麦、油菜良种一百六十五万多斤，安庆专区还培养训练了选种能手一万多人，并选定了种子地。河北省很多公社都已固定专人，建立选种队、组，确定选种地块。交河县文庙公社为选足留够优良麦种，公社党委和管理区、生产队的干部和有经验的社员共同组成了一支选种队伍，对本地和外地引进的各种麦种进行了田间视察、比较、分析，已选出适合本地培植的碧蚂一号等品种作为留种对象，并确定了五千多亩种子田，由专人管理，及时地拔除了病杂株，提高了种子的质量和纯度。任丘县县委书记和公社党委书记等也分片进行田间检查，确定种子地。这个县的新镇乡青年选种队还选出穗大、粒多、秆硬的麦穗四百个单株，加工培育，准备单收、单种，进行繁殖。湖南省湘阴县的二十多个公社选种任务已分配到生产队、作业组，共组织了七千五百多名社、队干部和社员逐田进行分品种鉴定，确定大、小麦、油菜种子田九万多亩，采用个别穗选结合片选的办法，计划选留种子一千三百万斤，现正在边收、边晒、边进仓。河南省偃师县的各级共青团组织也积极组织青年参加选种，目前已组织二万名青年和其他社员一道开展了选种工作，这个县翟镇公社岳滩大队的十个青年选种小组，通过技术传授，现场实习，培养出选种能手三十名，并且在八十多亩种子地上穗选出良种二千斤。
    为了选好、留足、保管好今年夏收作物的种子，不久前农业部派出了四个工作小组到江苏、江西、安徽、湖南、四川、陕西、河南七省帮助工作。各地的选种、留种工作，随着夏收的进展还将进一步展开。（附图片）
