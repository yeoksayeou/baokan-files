Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd -- U.S. Secretary of State Herter, who attended the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference, made a statement at the airport upon returning to the United States on the 21st, attempting to shift the responsibility for the failure to reach an agreement so far at the conference to the Soviet Union.

Herter admitted that in the discussions in Geneva, the West's first consideration was not anything else, but how to make their occupation of West Berlin permanent. Under the guise of safeguarding the "freedom of the people of West Berlin," he clamored: "We are determined, and will remain determined in the future, not to make any arrangements with the Soviet Union that would be detrimental to this freedom."

Herter said that when the Geneva conference reconvenes, the Western foreign ministers will be prepared to continue negotiations. However, he emphasized that, as before, the West "will insist on its rights and principles."

    赫脱回国后表示
    坚持永远占领西柏林
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：出席日内瓦外长会议的美国国务卿赫脱21日在回到美国时在机场上发表声明，力图把会议迄今没有达成协议的责任推给苏联。
    赫脱承认，在日内瓦的讨论中，西方首先考虑的不是别的，而是如何使它们对西柏林的占领永久化。他在维护“西柏林人民的自由”的幌子下叫嚷说：“我们坚决，而且今后仍将坚决不同苏联作出任何有损于这种自由的安排。”
    赫脱说，在日内瓦会议复会时，西方外长将准备继续谈判。但他强调，像以前一样，西方“将要坚持它们的权利和原则”。
