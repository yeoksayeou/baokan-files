TASS Geneva dispatch—TASS Geneva correspondent reports: The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has entered its sixth week, marked by informal meetings. Prior to this, there was a recess over the weekend and Sunday. During the recess, both Lloyd and Couve de Murville returned to their respective capitals. It should be said that the June 15th meeting attracted considerable attention, as the Western countries were expected to comment on the substance of the new Soviet proposals put forward by Gromyko at the formal meeting on June 10th. Everyone remembers that on June 12th, Lloyd, before leaving for London, said at the formal meeting that the Western countries "have not yet spoken their last word." But did the three Western foreign ministers say these words on June 15th? Did the Western countries put forward any constructive proposals, and did they take even one step towards reaching a mutually acceptable agreement? Obviously not.

Many newspapers, drawing inspiration and their own assessments from figures in the Western delegations, especially from the Federal Republic of Germany delegation, have gleefully and gloatingly predicted that even if the conference does not come to a complete halt, a prolonged interruption is "inevitable" in any case.

Throughout the negotiations, the Soviet Union has been seeking a negotiated solution to the West Berlin issue, a solution that would not harm any of the parties involved while ensuring the normalization of the international situation.

The Soviet government has strived to formulate mutually acceptable agreements, taking into account the importance that the three Western powers attach to the stationing of foreign troops in West Berlin, and agreed to the stationing of symbolic, strictly limited numbers of troops from the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in West Berlin, but of course, without any occupation rights; agreed to replace the troops of the three countries with limited forces from neutral countries.

Despite the Soviet side's concessions to the Western countries at many important moments, the Western countries have evaded the Soviet proposals, thereby exposing their dislike of any measures aimed at eliminating the occupation status of West Berlin.

However, in order to make the negotiations successful, the Soviet government showed patience and strong will, and on June 10th put forward new proposals on the issue of West Berlin and the All-German Committee. These proposals were welcomed by all peace-loving public opinion. The essence of these proposals is that the Soviet Union does not insist on the immediate and complete abolition of the West Berlin occupation system and agrees to temporarily preserve some occupation rights of the Western countries in West Berlin, but this situation will only exist for a strictly defined period of time, namely one year.

The Soviet delegation stated when putting forward its new proposals that if the Western countries do not take the above-mentioned minimum measures in West Berlin during the one-year transition period, then the Soviet Union will also not agree to the continued existence of the West Berlin occupation system. If the Western countries or the West German government obstruct a mutually agreed solution on the issue of concluding a peace treaty within the above-mentioned period, then the Soviet Union will have no choice but to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, together with other countries concerned in the war against Germany.

The new Soviet proposals once again show that the Soviet government is making every effort to seek a basis for converging the positions of the countries concerned.

But how have the three Western countries responded to the wishes of the Soviet government in the past and present? Their attitude, all their proposals, whether "old" or "new," can be summarized as seeking to make the occupation system of West Berlin permanent. The so-called constructive proposals on individual and partial issues, which they tirelessly talk about, cannot change the essence of their position, which is based on an unacceptable demand, namely, requiring the Soviet Union to tacitly or in writing agree to extend the occupation status of Berlin indefinitely.

One may ask, what is the purpose of the Western countries participating in the Geneva conference? Do they not know that the Soviet government raised the Berlin issue precisely because it believes that it is urgent to abolish the West Berlin occupation system? The position of the Western countries shows that the purpose of the Western countries' representatives in Geneva is simply to obstruct any agreement aimed at eliminating the dangerous root causes of tension in West Berlin.

The supporters of the "Cold War" policy, especially the Bonn diplomats and politicians, gloat because they have already foreseen the tendency of the Geneva negotiations to fail. However, the people of all countries oppose this prospect. Peace-loving people see that the possibility of reaching an agreement at the Geneva conference has not disappeared. As long as the three Western countries change their attitude and express their willingness to reach an agreement on a realistic and mutually acceptable basis, then the possibility of reaching an agreement has not been ruled out. The next few days will show which path they will choose.

    塔斯社日内瓦特派记者报道
    苏联力求协商解决西柏林问题
    西方仍然裹足不前妄图使占领制度永久化
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：塔斯社日内瓦特派记者报道，日内瓦外长会议已经进入以非正式会议为标志的第六周。在这以前，经过了周末和星期日的休会。在休会期间，劳埃德和德姆维尔都回到自己的首都。应当说，15日的会议引起了很大的注意，因为西方国家应当在会上对葛罗米柯在6月10日的正式会议上提出的苏联新建议的实质发表意见。大家都记得，6月12日，劳埃德在动身前往伦敦之前，在正式会议上曾说，西方国家“还没有说出自己最后的话”。但是，西方三国外长15日是否说出了这些话呢？西方国家是否提出了某种建设性的建议，它们在达成相互能够接受的协议方面是否迈出了即便是一步呢？显然没有。
    许多从西方代表团，特别是从德意志联邦共和国代表团人士中获取启示和自己的估价的报纸已经得意地、幸灾乐祸地预言，即使会议不致完全停止，长时间的中断无论如何是“不可避免的”。
    在谈判的整个过程中，苏联一直寻求关于西柏林问题的协商解决办法，寻求一种不致使任何一个有关方面受到损失，同时又能保证国际局势正常化的解决办法。
    苏联政府尽力制订相互能够接受的协议，考虑到西方三国重视在西柏林驻扎外国军队一事，同意在西柏林驻扎象征性的、在数量上受到严格规定的美、英、法、苏四国的军队，但是当然，它们没有任何占领的权利；同意或是用中立国家有限的部队来代替三国的部队。
    尽管在很多重要的时刻苏联方面迁就了西方国家，而西方国家却回避苏联的建议，从而暴露它们不喜欢任何旨在取消西柏林占领地位的措施。
    但是，苏联政府为了使谈判取得成就，表现了忍耐和坚强的意志，于6月10日提出了关于西柏林和全德委员会问题的新建议。这些建议受到所有爱好和平的社会舆论的欢迎。这些建议的实质在于苏联不坚持立即完全取消西柏林占领制度并同意暂时保存西方国家在西柏林的某些占领权利，但是，这种情况将只能存在于严格规定的时期之内，即为期一年。
    苏联代表团在提出自己的新建议时曾声明，如果西方国家在一年的过渡时期内，对西柏林不采取上述起码措施，那么，苏联也将不会同意西柏林占领制度的继续存在。如果西方国家或者西德政府阻挠在上述期限内就缔结和约问题取得一致同意的解决办法，那么，苏联将不得不同对德作战的其他有关国家一起，同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。
    苏联的新建议再一次表明，苏联政府在不遗余力地谋求有关国家立场接近的基础。
    可是西方三国过去和现在是怎样回答苏联政府的愿望呢？它们的态度，它们的所有建议，无论是“旧的”还是“新的”，归纳起来就是要使西柏林的占领制度永久化。它们不厌其烦地大谈特谈的关于个别、局部问题的所谓建设性建议，丝毫也不能改变它们的立场的实质，这种立场的基础是一种不能接受的要求，即要求苏联默默地或者用书面同意把柏林的占领状态无限期地延长下去。
    试问，西方国家究竟为了什么目的而参加日内瓦会议？难道它们不知道苏联政府提出柏林问题，正是因为它认为，迫切需要取消西柏林占领制度？西方国家的立场说明，西方国家代表到日内瓦的目的只不过是想阻碍达成旨在消除西柏林紧张局势危险根源的任何协议。
    “冷战”政策的拥护者，首先是波恩的外交家和政治家们幸灾乐祸，因为他们已经预感到日内瓦谈判有失败的趋向。但是，各国人民反对这种前景。爱好和平的人们看到了日内瓦会议达成协议的可能性并没有消失。只要三个西方国家改变它们的态度，并表示愿意在现实的和互相可以接受的基础上达成协议，那末达成协议的可能性并没有被排除。最近几天会表明它们将选择那条道路。
