Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 11th: The Kerala Legislative Assembly of India passed the Land Relations Bill proposed by the Communist Party amidst cheers on the 10th.

According to the Indian News Service, after the passage of this bill, members of opposition parties such as the Congress Party, the People's Socialist Party, and the Muslim League immediately left the venue to study their plans to launch a movement to overthrow the state government. A resolution recently passed by the Kerala State Committee of the Communist Party of India pointed out that the opposition parties are mainly attempting to prevent the passage of this Land Relations Bill and, in turn, overthrow the state government. Their efforts to oppose the impending implementation of the Education Act are merely being used as the beginning of this movement.

The Land Relations Bill stipulates: The maximum land holding for a family of five is fifteen acres (approximately ninety mu) of land that can be cultivated for two seasons a year; if the family has more than five members, then for each additional member, the family can hold one additional acre of such or equivalent land, with the total land for the entire family not exceeding twenty-five acres. Land exceeding the limit will be handed over to the government, which will pay landowners compensation at 50% of the market price of the land and distribute this land to landless or land-poor peasants. The bill stipulates the highest and lowest fair rent rates for various types of land. It stipulates the protection of the interests of small land owners who own less than five acres (approximately thirty mu) of land, who constitute the majority of peasants in the state. It also stipulates that tenants have fixed tenancy rights, and landlords must not arbitrarily reclaim the land leased to them.

The Indian Constitution stipulates that after land reform, landlords must be paid compensation. The maximum land holding limit and the compensation rate stipulated in this bill of Kerala are, so far, the lowest among the states. The State Assembly first proposed this bill in December 1957, and it was later submitted to the public for discussion and was welcomed. In the State Assembly, opposition party members opposed the distribution of land exceeding the limit to peasants, demanding that it be handed over to the village councils actually controlled by landlords and rich peasants; they demanded that landlords be paid compensation at 100% of the land price; and they also demanded that tenants' tenancy rights not be protected. These amendments were all rejected. The Land Relations Bill passed by the State Assembly will be submitted to the President of India for approval.

### 印度喀拉拉邦立法会议  通过土地关系法案

    印度喀拉拉邦立法会议
    通过土地关系法案
    新华社新德里11日电　印度喀拉拉邦立法会议10日在欢呼声中通过了共产党提出的土地关系法案。
    据印度新闻社报道，在这项法案通过以后，属于国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟等反对党的议员立即离开了会场，研究他们关于发动推翻邦政府的运动的计划。印度共产党喀拉拉邦委员会不久以前通过的决议指出，目前反对党主要是企图阻止这项土地关系法案的通过，进而推翻邦政府。他们竭力反对即将实施的教育法的行动，只是用来作为这个运动的开头。
    土地关系法案规定：五口之家占有土地的最高限额是十五英亩（约合九十市亩）一年可种两季的土地；如果家庭成员超过五人，那么每超过一人，可以多占有一英亩这样的或相当于这样的土地，全家土地总数不得超过二十五英亩。超过限额的土地交给政府，政府按土地市价50％付给地主以补偿费，并把这些土地分配给无地或少地的农民。法案规定了各类土地最高和最低的公平地租率。它规定保护占邦内农民大多数的、占地不到五英亩（约合三十市亩）的小土地所有者的利益。它还规定佃户有固定的租地权，地主不得无故收回租给他们的土地。
    印度宪法规定，实行土地改革后，要付给地主补偿费。喀拉拉邦的这项法案规定的占有土地最高限额和补偿费的比率，到目前为止在各邦中是最低的。邦议会在1957年12月第一次提出这项法案，后来曾经提交群众讨论并且受到欢迎。在邦议会中，反对党议员反对把超过限额的土地分给农民，而要求交给实际上由地主、富农把持的乡评议会；他们要求按地价的百分之百付给地主补偿费；还要求不要保护佃户的租地权。这些修正案都被否决了。邦议会通过的土地关系法案将提交印度总统批准。
