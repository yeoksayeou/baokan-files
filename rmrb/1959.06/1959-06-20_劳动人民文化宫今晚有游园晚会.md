    劳动人民文化宫今晚有游园晚会
    本报讯　为了丰富首都人民的夏季文化生活，北京市艺术公司和劳动人民文化宫，将于今天晚上在文化宫举行周末游园晚会，揭开今年文化盛季第一个游园晚会的序幕。
    在这一游园晚会上，京剧观众将能得到尽情欣赏。叶盛章，李慧芳，李宗义，王泉奎等人在劳动剧场演出“打花鼓”，“巴骆和”，“除三害”；张云溪等在前树林演“卖艺访友”、“秋江”等。
    中央广播民族乐团在西树林举行一场民族音乐会；实验歌剧院在后河有轻松的音乐、舞蹈。文化园还有军乐团伴奏的舞会。
    听相声，可以说是有共同兴趣的。北京曲艺团在西树林举行“相声大会”。一周辛勤劳动以后，在这儿开怀大笑几声，那将是“笑一笑，十年少”。
    电影爱好者，将会在东树林看到“女篮五号”，或在儿童体育场观看“春”、“秋”两部电影。体育场将有精彩的男女篮球赛。
