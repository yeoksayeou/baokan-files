    Big Trusts Conspire to Obstruct Cuban Land Reform
    Editor's Note: The American "Worker's Weekly" published an article by Joseph North on June 7, titled "Big Trusts Conspire to Obstruct Land Reform in New Cuba." This article exposes the conspiracy of Cuban big landowners and American companies owning land in Cuba to sabotage Cuban land reform. Excerpts are translated as follows:
    Two million Cuban farmers are eagerly awaiting the free land guaranteed to them by the Land Reform Law—sixty-seven acres (one acre equals 6.07 Chinese mu) for every five-person family.
    In Cuba, 6.6 million acres of land will be distributed, and approximately 4,432 large plantations will be dissolved, while the United Fruit Company (of the United States) and the Cuban-American Sugar Company are the primary owners of more than 2,125,000 acres of the world's richest sugarcane plantations. Therefore, the land reform phase of the Cuban Revolution is facing increasingly fierce attacks, mainly from some large American companies and the forces they can influence within Cuba.
    Last week, many American newspapers fiercely criticized Premier Castro's government's land reform law. "Time" magazine threatened another Guatemala incident, while the "New York Herald Tribune," "Wall Street Journal," and "New York Times" clamored about the "threat of Bolshevism."
    Various threats are flowing in continuously. The U.S. government has threatened to greatly reduce the U.S. quota for purchasing Cuban sugar. Investments in the Cuban sugar industry are estimated at around one billion U.S. dollars, most of which are American investments.
    The Cuban government is expropriating land according to law. The government will compensate landowners according to the prices stipulated for taxation purposes before October 10, 1958. Batista's tax officials "generously" valued the land of large landowners very low, and today the large land monopolists are bound to "eat their own bitter fruit."
    Besides the sugar industry, foreign companies also own plantations of tobacco, coffee, pineapples, bananas, and oranges. The Land Reform Law also applies to these lands. The law prohibits foreigners from inheriting Cuban real estate. Other aspects of the Land Reform Law include the abolition of in-kind rent, which is the main source of exploitation by foreign companies.
    The vast majority of people across the country applaud the Land Reform Law. Most people not only understand that the Land Reform Law satisfies their wishes, but also understand that the Land Reform Law is the first major step in getting rid of semi-colonial status. They also know that this is the main way to solve the country's unemployment situation. Seven hundred thousand out of Cuba's 6.25 million people are unemployed.
    However, not everything is going smoothly. Last week, news came that hundreds of tobacco farmers in Pinar del Río province in the west held demonstrations against the Land Reform Law. This news immediately reached the other side of the Florida Straits (i.e., reached the United States) and spread throughout the newspapers of North America. "Hoy" revealed that the gatherings in Pinar del Río were basically instigated by large landowners and their accomplices, fake "small owners (small farmers)." "Hoy" called for official measures to be taken to protect small and medium farmers from the influence of large landowners.

### 大托拉斯阴谋阻挠古巴土改

    大托拉斯阴谋阻挠古巴土改
    编者按：6月7日一期的美国“工人周报”刊登了约瑟夫·诺思写的一篇文章，题为“大托拉斯阴谋阻挠新古巴的土地改革”。这篇文章揭露了古巴大庄园主和在古巴拥有土地的美国公司破坏古巴土地改革的阴谋活动。现摘译如下：
    二百万古巴农民已在急切地等待着土地改革法保证分给他们的自由土地——每五口之家可分得六十七英亩（每英亩等于六点零七市亩）。
    在古巴，六百六十万英亩的土地将进行分配，大约有四千四百三十二个大种植园将瓦解，而（美国的）联合果品公司和古美糖公司是世界上最富庶的甘蔗种植园的二百一十二万五千多英亩土地的主要拥有者。因此，古巴革命的土地改革阶段正在遭到日益猛烈的攻击，这些攻击主要来自美国的一些大公司和它们在古巴国内所能影响的那些力量。
    上周，美国许多报纸大骂卡斯特罗总理政府的土地改革法，“时代”杂志扬言将发生另一次危地马拉事件，“纽约先驱论坛报”、“华尔街日报”和“纽约时报”则叫嚷“布尔什维克主义的威胁”。
    各种威胁正在源源而来，美国政府扬言将大大减少美国购买古巴蔗糖的定额。古巴糖工业的投资估计在十亿美元左右，大部分是美国的投资。
    古巴政府正根据法律征用土地。政府将按照1958年10月10日以前为征税而规定的价格来偿还地主。巴蒂斯塔的税吏们“豪爽”地把大地主的土地的价格估得很低，今天大土地垄断者势必“自食其果”。
    除了糖业以外，外国公司还拥有烟草、咖啡、菠萝、香蕉和桔子的种植园。土地改革法也同样适用于这些土地。法律禁止外国人继承古巴的地产。土地改革法的其他方面包括废除实物地租，这是外国公司进行剥削的主要根源。
    全国绝大多数人民都欢呼土地改革法。大部分人不仅了解土地改革法满足了他们的愿望，而且了解土地改革法是在摆脱半殖民地地位方面的第一个巨大进展。他们还知道，这是解决全国失业情况的主要办法。古巴六百二十五万人口中有七十万人失业。
    但是，并不是一切都很顺利。上周有消息说，西部比那尔德里奥省的几百个烟农举行示威反对土地改革法。这个消息立即传到了佛罗里达海峡的彼岸（按：即传到了美国），并传遍了北美的报纸。“今日报”透露，比那尔德里奥的集会，基本上是大地主和他们的同谋者、冒名的“小所有者（小农）”所煽动起来的。“今日报”要求官方采取进一步措施，使小农和中农不受大地主的影响。
