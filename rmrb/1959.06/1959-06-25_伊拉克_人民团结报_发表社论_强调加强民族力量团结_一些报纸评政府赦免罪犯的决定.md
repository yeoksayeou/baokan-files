Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 23rd: The "People's Unity" newspaper published an editorial on the 22nd, emphasizing that in the current decisive situation, the unity of national forces is more important than at any other time in Iraq's history.

The editorial stated that imperialists and their running dogs are stepping up their efforts to divide the ranks of the people and national forces. It pointed out that the Iraqi people have expressed their firm adherence to the slogan of uniting national ranks, as demonstrated by the recent large-scale mass demonstrations, parades, and rallies in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq.

The newspaper emphasized that the National United Front is an effective and practical means of mobilizing the Iraqi people's forces and organizing them around the banner of their heroic republic, as proven by past and present facts in Iraq and elsewhere. It called on all national and democratic forces to form a broad national front to stop the threat of imperialism and fully realize the goals of the revolution.

The newspaper said, "The intensification of imperialist and reactionary activities to divide the revolutionary ranks and undermine the achievements of the revolution will only cause our people and loyal national forces to strengthen their unity, unite closely on a more solid and stable foundation, and consolidate the unity between the people, its army, and the government under the leadership of leader Qasim."

The "People's Unity" newspaper's editorial on the 23rd reviewed the imperialist attempts to deprive the Iraqi people of the fruits of the July 14th Revolution. It said that the imperialists realized that "such attempts would not succeed unless national unity was divided." It said, "Therefore, they attempted to undermine national unity and create artificial disputes among national forces in order to prepare a suitable atmosphere for instigating conspiracies of aggression and undermining revolutionary achievements."

The newspaper called attention to the danger of preventing any class or its political representatives from actively participating in consolidating the republic and strengthening democracy. The newspaper said that this practice "lays the first wedge for dividing national unity."

The newspaper called for increased vigilance to thwart all attempts by imperialism to weaken national unity.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 24th: The "Voice of Free Men" newspaper commented on the 23rd on the Iraqi government's decision to pardon certain reactionaries, saying that humanitarianism cannot and should not include the enemies of mankind. The newspaper said, "To talk about humanitarianism and leniency towards the enemies of the republic is to be cruel to the people and their sacrifices."

The Iraqi government recently announced an amnesty for criminals during Eid al-Adha. Some people who had been exiled to various parts of Iraq have been allowed to return home. These people were exiled for participating in imperialist conspiracies to undermine the security of the Iraqi Republic or for attacking citizens and creating provocations. According to a report in the "News" newspaper on the 24th, one hundred and twenty-eight prisoners in Baghdad Central Prison and another sixty prisoners in Mosul Prison have been released.

The newspaper pointed out that just as Iraqis are being killed by feudal lords every day, the government formally announced the decision to pardon reactionaries. This means that more people will be killed and a good atmosphere will be created for the enemies of the republic and the people. This is exactly what the imperialists want us to do, to keep us busy with internal problems. That way, they have plenty of time and opportunity to plot conspiracies.

The newspaper called for increased vigilance against the imperialists and other reactionaries who are constantly plotting against the Iraqi Republic.

Representatives of people's organizations in Khanaqin submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Qasim, drawing his attention to the fact that feudal elements in that area are continuously attacking farmers, and demanding that the government use an iron fist to resolutely suppress reactionaries and feudal elements who are undermining the people's peace and the security of the republic.

Another memorandum submitted to Qasim by approximately 50,000 people in Nasiriyah Province pointed out that the failure of some local authorities to take resolute measures against the enemies of the republic has fueled reactionary provocations.

The "National Newspaper" published an editorial on the 24th calling for the protection of farmers and the defense of their fruits. It said that external and local enemies are unhappy with the fruits gained by the farmers, who constitute the majority of the Iraqi people. They have taken a hostile attitude towards the land reform law, which can be said to be a revolutionary step towards the liberation of farmers.

The newspaper called for the strict punishment of those who killed farmers "before the feudalists launch another attack." The newspaper emphasized that ignoring this demand will lead to more sacrifices for the farmers.

    伊拉克“人民团结报”发表社论
    强调加强民族力量团结
    一些报纸评政府赦免罪犯的决定
    新华社巴格达23日电　“人民团结报”22日发表社论强调指出，在目前决定性的情况下，民族力量的团结比伊拉克经历的任何其它时候都格外重要。
    社论说，帝国主义者和他们的走狗正在加紧分裂人民和民族力量的队伍。它指出，伊拉克人民群众表示他们坚决遵从团结民族队伍的口号，正如巴格达和伊拉克其它地方最近举行的大规模群众示威、游行和集会上所表明的那样。
    这家报纸强调指出，民族统一阵线是动员伊拉克人民力量并把他们组织在他们的英雄的共和国旗帜周围的行之有效的实际手段，这已为伊拉克和其他各地过去和目前的事实所证明。它要求所有的民族和民主力量组成广泛的民族阵线，以便制止帝国主义的威胁和充分实现革命的目的。
    这家报纸说，“帝国主义和反动派分裂革命队伍和破坏革命成果的活动的加紧，只会使我们的人民和忠实的民族力量加强他们的团结，在更加巩固和稳定的基础上紧密团结起来，并且在领袖卡塞姆的领导下巩固人民和它的军队及政府之间的团结。”
    “人民团结报”23日的社论回顾了帝国主义想要剥夺伊拉克人民7月14日革命的成果的企图。它说，帝国主义者认识到“除非分裂民族团结，否则这种企图是不会成功的。”它说，“因此他们就企图破坏民族团结，制造民族力量之间的人为的争端，以便为策动侵略阴谋和破坏革命成就准备适当的气氛。”
    这家报纸提请大家注意阻止任何阶级或它的政治代表积极参加巩固共和国和加强民主的做法的危险。这家报纸说，这种做法是“为分裂民族团结打下第一个楔子”。
    这家报纸要求提高警惕以粉碎帝国主义企图削弱民族团结的一切尝试。
    新华社巴格达24日电　“自由人之声报”23日就伊拉克政府关于赦免某些反动分子的决定发表评论说，人道主义决不能而且决不应当包括人类的敌人。报纸说，“对共和国的敌人讲人道主义和宽大就是对人民的残忍和牺牲。”
    伊拉克政府最近宣布在古尔邦节大赦罪犯。一些被流放到伊拉克各地的人已被允许回家。这些人是因为参加帝国主义破坏伊拉克共和国安全的阴谋或者攻击公民制造挑衅事件而被流放的。据“消息报”24日报道，巴格达中央监狱里的一百二十八名犯人和摩苏尔监狱里的其它六十名犯人已被释放。
    这家报纸指出，正当伊拉克人民每天都有人被封建主杀害的时候，政府正式宣布了赦免反动分子的决定。这意味着将有更多的人被杀害，并且为共和国和人民的敌人创造良好的气氛。这正是帝国主义者希望我们做的事，使我们忙于内部的问题。这样，他们便有充分的时间和机会来策划阴谋。
    这家报纸要求提高对时刻在阴谋反对伊拉克共和国的帝国主义者和其它反动分子的警惕。
    哈纳金的人民团体代表向卡塞姆总理提交了一份备忘录提请他注意封建分子在那个地区连续攻击农民的事实，并要求政府用铁腕来坚决镇压反动派和封建分子，这些破坏人民的和平和共和国安全的人。
    纳西里亚省约五万人向卡塞姆提交的另一份备忘录指出，由于一些地方当局没有对共和国的敌人采取坚决的措施，这就助长了反动的挑衅活动。
    “国家报”24日发表社论要求保护农民和保卫他们的果实。它说，外部和当地的敌人对构成伊拉克人民大多数的农民所获得的果实是不高兴的。他们对可以说是使农民走向解放的一个革命步骤，即土地改革法，采取了敌对的态度。
    这家报纸要求“在封建主义者再次发动进攻以前”严惩杀害农民的凶手。报纸强调说，无视这种要求将使农民遭到更多的牺牲。
