Oasis Song of Triumph

    The first color feature film reflecting the life and struggle of the Uygur people of our country, "Oasis Song of Triumph" (tentative title), began filming on the morning of June 5th at the Haiyan Film Studio's Stage 2.

    "Oasis Song of Triumph" was created by Wang Yuhu and four others. It depicts the struggle between two roads in the agricultural cooperativization movement of the Uygur people. The protagonists Slajidin (played by Balati, the director of the cooperative) and Ayisham Kerim (played by Ayimuhan, the production team leader), as well as all the actors, are actors from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Song and Dance Drama Troupe.

    Director Zhao Ming and others recently went to Xinjiang to immerse themselves in life, inspecting locations and collecting materials in the areas of Turpan and Kashgar. Next month, the "Oasis Song of Triumph" film crew will go to these places to shoot on location.

    "Oasis Song of Triumph" is a joint production of the Haiyan Film Studio and the Xinjiang Film Studio. It embodies the fraternal unity between the Han and Uygur nationalities and the spirit of comprehensive cooperation in literary and artistic undertakings.
