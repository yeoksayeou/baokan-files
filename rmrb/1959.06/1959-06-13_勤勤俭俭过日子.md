Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 12th: Residents of Jingwei Tongjiang Street in Harbin have recently achieved new successes in managing their households thriftily, having been repeatedly recognized as an advanced unit in social economy for three consecutive years.

Jingwei Tongjiang Street has over 9,000 households, mostly working people. Under the constant education of the street's Party organization, every family plans their life carefully, paying attention to economizing on food, cloth, coal, electricity, and other necessities. Thrifty household management and hard work have become virtues in their lives. The twenty households in the 86th Resident Group of this street are all headed by housewives in their fifties. They conduct economy competitions, comparing who can cook more food from the same amount of rice and who can save more coal. Whoever does the best is respected by everyone, and everyone comes to learn from her. She also teaches her economy methods to others without reservation. Residents also pay attention to plugging loopholes that waste food at any time. February has 28 days, and the residents voluntarily proposed not to eat the "big month" grain in small months, and the whole street bought more than 44,000 catties less grain this month. The grain supply department supplies some soybeans to residents for making soy sauce, and households that do not make soy sauce automatically do not buy soybeans. From January to May, the street has saved more than 580,000 catties of grain calculated according to the grain ration. In terms of saving cotton cloth, the residents of the whole street generally use methods such as measuring clothes to fit, cutting large clothes with small clothes, renewing old clothes, and altering large clothes to small clothes. They said: dismantling and washing, helping and mending, saving money for ourselves, and saving cloth for the country is good for both the country and ourselves. Li Guiyun, a resident of the 7th Residents' Committee, has experience in saving cloth when cutting clothes, so she actively helps her east and west neighbors to cut clothes. She has now taught many people. From January to May this year, the whole street has saved more than 81,000 feet of cotton cloth.

Because of their thrifty household management and planned life arrangements, the residents of this street live relatively well. Among the 9,726 households in the street, except for 11 households who need government relief due to lack of labor and other special difficulties, the rest of the households are living well and have developed good saving habits. Zhang Bofang's family of seven in the 70th Resident Group has a monthly income of 82 yuan. Because they plan their spending and arrange their lives well, they save an average of 10 yuan per month.

    Bi Chunhua Leads Residents to Save Grain

In Guanghe Street, Xigang District, Dalian, there is an old lady named Bi Chunhua, who is a Communist Party member and has attended the National Congress of Active Women.

Comrade Bi Chunhua is very good at managing her life. Her family has a total of nine people, including four students. In her family life plan, which she has implemented for more than four years, she specifically stipulates the targets and measures for saving. For example, she saves cloth by using four methods: joining (small pieces to make large pieces), mending, turning over, and altering, saving 36 feet of cloth coupons for the country every year. In addition, the whole family saves 27.5 catties of grain every month. She spends according to plan every month and saves 8 yuan.

She not only saves grain for her family, but also leads the majority of residents to save. There are 77 households in the building where she lives. After women participated in productive labor last year, the ration was increased, and some women wasted some grain. She found two typical examples to educate everyone. She said that building the country is not just the responsibility of one person, everyone has a responsibility, and everyone must have a spirit of hard work and a spirit of economy, which cannot be ignored for a moment, and if it is ignored, it will cause waste. After her education, households who used to shout that there was not enough food are now surplus grain households, and they can always save 14 or 15 catties every month. In this way, the grain ration for this building of more than 300 people has dropped from an average of more than 27 catties per person per month to 25.7 catties, making it a relatively outstanding building in the street for saving grain.

    Educating Children to be Thrifty

Yu Guizhen, a resident of Tianjin Street, Zhongshan District, Dalian, has a family of nine, with seven children, and relies on her husband's monthly income of more than 80 yuan to maintain her life. Yu Guizhen manages her household frugally and arranges her family life very well. She is also good at setting an example and educating her children to love labor and pay attention to frugality.

Yu Guizhen heard that the school teacher was educating students to cherish food, so she seized this opportunity and told her children about the importance of saving food when the seven children were sitting around eating together. The children's self-esteem is relatively strong. Sometimes, when they eat pancakes and spill some pancake crumbs, their mother says, "See who has no pancake crumbs in front of them." The children quickly picked up the spilled pancake crumbs and ate them. When the mother eats pancakes, she breaks off as much as she eats, and the children have also learned to do this. Even the youngest seventh child, who is over three years old and loves to ask for large pieces, knows to take small pieces first, and then take more if it is not enough. Miao Di Illustration

    Aunt Han Persists in Saving for Thirteen Years

Aunt Han Yuqing of Minquan Street, Shahekou District, Dalian, has persisted in saving for thirteen years. As early as when Dalian was just liberated, the country called on the masses to save expenses, and she actively responded. At that time, only the eldest old man in Aunt Han's family was working, earning 50 or 60 yuan a month, supporting a family of nine and providing for several children to go to school, so life was not wealthy. However, the sense of responsibility of the master prompted the old lady to live more carefully. She made careful calculations for various expenses such as coal, grain, cloth, water, electricity, and transportation costs, saving even a few cents that could be avoided, and saving a few yuan to more than ten yuan every month to support national construction.

In recent years, Aunt Han has personally seen that the country is becoming more prosperous year by year, and people's lives are improving year by year, which has given her even more enthusiasm. Although the eldest old man has passed away, her children are now able to shoulder the burden of family economic life. Aunt Han saves all of her monthly income of more than 50 yuan, except for planned savings. If it is not enough, she takes a few yuan from the current deposit to make up for it. She said: Regular savings take a long time, so the country can use it for a longer time; if I really don't have enough, taking two current deposits will have less impact on the country.

    勤勤俭俭过日子
    家家有计划  处处都节约
    哈尔滨经纬通江街居民勤俭成风
    新华社哈尔滨12日电　曾经连续三年被评为社会节约先进单位的哈尔滨市道里区经纬通江街的居民们，最近在勤俭持家方面又取得了新的成绩。
    经纬通江街共有九千多户居民，大部分是劳动人民。他们在街道党组织的经常教育下，家家生活有计划，用粮、用布、用煤、用电等处处注意节约，勤俭持家、艰苦朴素成为他们生活的美德。这条街第八十六居民组的二十户居民，家庭主妇都是五十多岁的老年人，她们开展节约竞赛，做饭比谁出饭多，用煤比谁用得省。谁作得最好，就受到大家的尊敬，都来向她学习，她也毫不保留地把自己节约的方法教给别人。居民们还随时注意堵塞浪费粮食的漏洞。2月份是二十八天，居民们自动提出小月不吃大月粮，全街在这个月就少买了四万四千多斤粮食。粮食供应部门供给一些大豆给居民做酱，不做酱的户都自动不买大豆。从1月到5月，这条街按粮食定量计算已节约粮食五十八万多斤。在节约棉布方面，全街居民普遍做到量体裁衣、大衣小衣套着裁、用旧翻新、以大改小等办法。她们说：拆拆洗洗，帮帮补补，自己省了钱，国家省了布，对国家对自己都有好处。第七居民委员会居民李桂云有一套裁衣服省布的经验，就主动帮助东邻西舍裁衣服，现在她已经教会了很多人。从今年1月到5月，全街已节约棉布八万一千多尺。
    这条街道的居民由于勤俭持家，有计划地安排生活，生活过得都比较好。全街九千七百二十六户中，除了十一户因为没有劳动力和有其它特殊困难需要政府救济以外，其余各户日子都过得很好，并且养成了良好的储蓄习惯。第七十居民组居民张伯芳一家七口人，每月收入八十二元，由于花钱有计划，生活安排得好，平均每月都储蓄十元。
    毕春花带动居民节约粮食
    旅大市西岗区广和街，有个老大娘，她的名字叫毕春花，是共产党员，曾出席过全国妇女积极分子代表大会。
    毕春花同志很会过日子。她家共九口人，四个学生。在她已执行了四年多的家庭生活计划上，具体地规定了节约的指标和措施。如，她以接（小接大的）、补、翻、改四种办法节约用布，每年节约布票三十六尺交给国家。另外，每月全家还节约二十七斤半粮食。她每月按计划开支，储蓄八元。
    她不仅一家人节约粮食，还带动广大居民节约。她住的大楼共有七十七户，从去年妇女参加生产劳动后，定量提高了，有些妇女对粮食有些浪费。她就找了两个典型人物，来教育大家。她说，建设国家不是哪一个人的事，人人都有责任，每个人都要有个艰苦的思想、节约的思想，一时一刻也不能忽视，一忽视就会造成浪费。经过她的教育，过去喊着粮食不够吃的户，现在变成了余粮户，每月总能节约十四、五斤。这样，这三百多个人的大楼，粮食定量由过去每人每月平均二十七斤多，下降到二十五斤七两，成为该街道节约粮食比较突出的大楼。
    教育孩子勤俭
    旅大市中山区天津街居民于桂珍，九口之家，有七个孩子，靠她丈夫每月收入八十多元维持生活。于桂珍持家勤俭，把家庭生活安排得很好。她还善于以身作则，教育孩子爱劳动，注意俭朴。
    于桂珍听说学校老师正在教育学生爱惜粮食，就抓紧这个机会，在七个孩子围坐在一起吃饭的时候，向孩子们讲了节约粮食的意义。孩子们的自尊心都比较强，有时，吃饼子撒下点饼渣子，妈妈说：“看谁眼前没有饼渣子。”孩子们连忙把撒下的饼渣子捡起来吃了。妈妈吃饼子时，吃多少掰多少，孩子也都学会了，连过去最爱要大块的三周岁多的老七，也知道先拿小块的吃，吃了不够再拿。苗地插图
    韩大娘坚持储蓄十三年
    旅大市沙河口区民权街韩玉卿大娘，已坚持储蓄十三年了。还在旅大刚解放的时候，国家号召群众节约开支，她就积极响应。当时，老大娘家只有老大爷一个人干活，每月收入五、六十元，养活九口之家，还供几个孩子上学念书，生活不算富裕。但是，主人翁的责任感，促使老大娘更精细地过日子。煤、粮、布、水、电、车费等各项开支，她都做到了精打细算，把可以不用的哪怕是几分钱，也都积攒下来，每月储蓄几元到十几元，支援国家建设。
    这几年来，韩老大娘亲眼看到国家一年比一年兴旺，人民生活一年比一年提高，更有了劲头。虽然老大爷去世了，但她的儿女都已能担起家庭经济生活的担子。老大娘把每月五十多元的收入，除有计划地节约开支外，全部都储蓄起来。万一不够用，就在活期存款里取出几元钱来弥补。她说：定期储蓄时间长，可以让国家多用些时候；自己实在不够用，拿两个活期钱对国家影响小些。（附图片）
