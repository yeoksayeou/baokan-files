Two Questions Concerning Lao Tzu's Philosophy
Feng Youlan

Editor's Note: There was a relatively heated debate about Lao Tzu's philosophical thought at the academic discussion held in Beijing in early May. Some people believed that Lao Tzu's philosophical thought was basically materialistic, while others believed that Lao Tzu's philosophical thought was basically idealistic. This newspaper plans to publish two articles on these two different viewpoints for reference. Mr. Feng Youlan advocates the former viewpoint, and at the same time, he also puts forward his own views on the era in which the book "Lao Tzu" was produced and its relationship with Lao Tzu. Because his article is relatively long, we will publish it in two days.

The book "Lao Tzu" is "concise in wording but rich in meaning." Although it only has about five thousand words, it includes a complete philosophical system. Most of its sentences are in rhyme, making it truly a philosophical poem. As a philosophical paper, five thousand words are too short; but as a philosophical poem, five thousand words are quite long.

I say it is a philosophical poem not only because it has a rhyming form. In terms of content, it also has the characteristics of Chinese poetry, that is, after reading each chapter, one always feels that there is some "remaining meaning that is not fully expressed." This "unexpressed meaning" is not exactly the same for each reader. As a philosophical "poem," it is a very successful poem. But as a "philosophical" poem, it has a great shortcoming, because the feelings of each reader are different, and their understanding of Lao Tzu's philosophy will not be exactly the same.

The current discussions in the philosophical community about Lao Tzu's philosophy probably focus on two questions. The first question is about the era in which the book "Lao Tzu" was produced and what kind of relationship it has with Lao Tzu as a person. The second question is whether the philosophical thought system expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" is materialistic or idealistic. The first question has been entangled since the "May Fourth" Movement. The second question has gradually become the center of discussion after 1949.

Regarding the first question, most of the current researchers of the history of philosophy admit that there was a person named Lao Tzu, i.e., Lao Dan, who lived at the same time as or slightly before Confucius. They also admit that the book "Lao Tzu" was not written by Lao Dan himself, but was produced later. They also admit that the philosophical thought expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" may include some ideas belonging to Lao Dan himself, and some belonging to Lao Dan's later followers. But which part belongs to Lao Dan himself? This is the question that is currently being debated. Among the researchers of Chinese philosophy, some people believe that although the book "Lao Tzu" was produced later, the main and basic ideas in it belong to Lao Tzu himself. This group of people will be referred to as Party A below. Another group of people believes that since the book "Lao Tzu" was produced later, the basic and main philosophical ideas in it are also relatively late. This book may also include some of Lao Dan's own ideas, but those are relatively unimportant. This group of people will be referred to as Party B below. I belong to Party B.

In essence, this question boils down to whether the philosophical thought expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" is a thought of the late Spring and Autumn period, or a thought of the mid or late Warring States period? For the study of Chinese philosophy, this is certainly not a small question, because the philosophical thought system expounded in the book "Lao Tzu," whether it is materialistic or idealistic, occupies an important position in the pre-Qin period and has had a great influence on later generations. Without clarifying the era in which it appeared, we cannot have a correct understanding of the development of pre-Qin philosophical thought.

Regarding this question, both Parties A and B have put forward a lot of evidence, which all seem to be "well-founded and reasonable." It is impossible for me to list all the arguments of both sides here, but I can only briefly mention a few points to illustrate the complexity of this question.

One of the main methods for verifying the era of a work is to see which era the problems it reflects belong to. For example, the book "Lao Tzu" says: "Do not value the worthy, so that the people do not contend." "Valuing the worthy" was a political slogan put forward by Mozi. Lao Tzu's saying "Do not value the worthy" is to oppose the political slogan of the Mohists and establish an opposite side to the Mohists. Lao Tzu advocates "abandoning benevolence and discarding righteousness." Mozi and Mencius emphasized benevolence and righteousness, putting "benevolence" and "righteousness" on an equal footing. Lao Tzu's advocacy of "abandoning benevolence and discarding righteousness" is also to establish an opposite side to them. These points all prove that the era in which the book "Lao Tzu" appeared was the mid-Warring States period or slightly later.

This is one of Party B's arguments. Most of Party A also admit that the situations mentioned above exist, but they believe that these parts in the book "Lao Tzu" were supplemented and added by people of the Warring States period.

On the surface, Party A's explanation puts Party B in a difficult position, because this approach renders useless one of the main methods for verifying the era of a work. Party B spent a lot of effort proving that certain parts of the book "Lao Tzu" reflected problems of the Warring States period, not the late Spring and Autumn period. Party A only needs to say: Your verification may be correct, but these parts of the book "Lao Tzu" were supplemented and added by people of the Warring States period. With such a casual sentence or two, Party B is blocked.

Party B also uses similar methods for Party A. For example, Party A says: The "Bu Er" chapter of "LÃ¼shi Chunqiu" clearly says "Lao Dan valued gentleness, and Confucius valued benevolence," Lao Dan was before Confucius. Party B says: We do not deny that there was a Lao Dan who "valued gentleness" before Confucius, we only believe that the basic and main philosophical ideas expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" are late. With such a casual sentence or two, Party A is also blocked. The debates on both sides are like toffee, with great elasticity.

Although both are toffee, I think Party B's reasons are more sufficient. Because a book produced later can include previous ideas, while a book produced earlier cannot include later ideas, it must be said that the later ideas were added and supplemented by later generations. Strictly speaking, if Party A says that certain parts of the book "Lao Tzu" were supplemented and added by people of the Warring States period, then it needs to provide some other evidence besides the inconsistency of ideas. It cannot be said that certain parts were supplemented and added in the Warring States period simply because the problems they reflect are from the Warring States period. Party A must prove from other aspects (style, textual research, etc.) that these parts were added later in order to break Party B's arguments. Otherwise, it will commit the logical fallacy of "begging the question."

Party A may say that although we cannot prove from other aspects that certain parts of the book "Lao Tzu" were supplemented and added by people of the Warring States period, we do have definite evidence to prove that the main and basic ideas expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" belong to Lao Dan himself. The main evidence is found in the "Tianxia" chapter of "Zhuangzi."

The "Tianxia" chapter of "Zhuangzi" gave an account of Lao Dan's philosophical thought. This account is indeed basically consistent with the philosophical thought expounded in the book "Lao Tzu." Although the "Tianxia" chapter was not necessarily written by Zhuangzi himself, it is a relatively serious philosophical history paper, which is something that everyone has recently admitted. Based on the philosophical thought of Lao Dan described in the "Tianxia" chapter, Party A concludes that the philosophical thought expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" is basically Lao Dan's philosophical thought. This evidence is relatively strong.

But things are not that simple. The "Tianxia" chapter is a relatively serious philosophical history paper. Its order of narrating the various schools is obviously based on a standard, and it does not simply talk about whichever school comes to mind first. Party B believes that this standard is the chronological order. The "Tianxia" chapter first introduces the Confucian school, then the Mohist school, and then the Taoist school. The Taoist school is further divided into four factions. Among these four factions, it first introduces Song Xing and Yin Wen, then Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao, then Guan Yin and Lao Dan, and then Zhuang Zhou. Party B believes that according to this order in the "Tianxia" chapter, the philosophical thought system expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" occurred before Zhuangzi, but not long before.

Mr. Guo Moruo believes that the book "Lao Tzu" was written by Huan Yuan during the Warring States period; Huan Yuan was also Guan Yin. According to this textual research, the era of the book "Lao Tzu" is roughly consistent with the order arranged in the "Tianxia" chapter. However, Guo Lao also believes based on the "Tianxia" chapter that although Huan Yuan wrote the book "Lao Tzu," the basic ideas of this book still belong to Lao Dan of the Spring and Autumn period. This raises a question. If the basic ideas of the book "Lao Tzu" still belong to Lao Dan of the Spring and Autumn period, then Lao Dan is the founder of Taoism, and Guan Yin is just a later follower. However, the "Tianxia" chapter puts Guan Yin before Lao Dan when narrating Guan Yin and Lao Dan. There must be a reason for this. At least we can believe that although the "Tianxia" chapter does not necessarily believe that Lao Dan himself was a person of the Warring States period, the philosophical system of the book "Lao Tzu" was established during the Warring States period.

Regarding this question, Party A also has its own explanation. They believe that the standard for narrating the order of the various schools in the "Tianxia" chapter is not the chronological order, but the logical order. The author of the "Tianxia" chapter believes that Zhuangzi's philosophical thought is the best and most complete, so it is placed last. The next most complete is the philosophical thought of Guan Yin and Lao Dan, and the next is the philosophical thought of Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao. According to this reasoning, the philosophical thought of the Confucian school is the least complete. Therefore, the "Tianxia" chapter puts it first.

This statement also has some truth. From Song Xing and Yin Wen to Zhuang Zhou, let's temporarily put aside the distinction between their materialistic and idealistic thoughts and focus solely on the completeness of the system and the meticulousness of the debate. There is indeed a step-by-step progression. Zhuangzi's philosophical thought has indeed reached the peak of pre-Qin Taoist idealism. From the development of Taoist idealism, there is indeed a logical order.

However, the logical order and the chronological order should be unified. I will talk about this point below. Therefore, although Party A's views are different from Party B's views, from Party B's point of view, Party A's views have not overturned Party B's views, but have actually strengthened Party B's views.

There is a lot of debate between Party A and Party B about the era of the book "Lao Tzu." I have only given one example above to illustrate the complexity of this question. The evidence presented by either side cannot convince the other. The two sides are fighting back and forth, making it difficult to distinguish the winner.

I believe that focusing solely on arguing about a specific piece of evidence cannot solve the problem. We must first look at it from a broader perspective. From a broader perspective, there are three points worth noting.

The first point is to look at the general academic development situation in the pre-Qin period. Starting from Zhang Xuecheng of the Qing Dynasty, the historical community has gradually recognized a law regarding the academic development of the pre-Qin period. That is, before Confucius, "there was no such thing as private writing." Private writing came with private teaching. In the era of slave-owner aristocracy rule, culture and academics were controlled by the aristocracy. The many knowledgeable slaves they raised actually controlled academics and culture. They did not control it in a private capacity, but in the name of the rulers or the state. This is what is called "learning in the government." After the rule of the slave-owner aristocracy began to collapse, there was private teaching. However, in the early stages of private teaching, there were still no formal private writings. They only discussed matters and expressed some opinions, without leaving specific issues to make general treatises. For example, "Analects" is not a formal work of Confucius, but only a record of some of his speeches on certain issues by his students. Mozi also did not have formal writings. The works belonging to the early Mohist school were also records of Mozi's speeches by his students, so each chapter begins with "Zi Mozi said." Of course, Mozi's speeches are much more detailed than Confucius's speeches. This is the progress of the times.

The book "Lao Tzu" is a formal private work. It is inconsistent with the above-mentioned law to say that it came out before Confucius. We cannot conversely say that because the book "Lao Tzu" came out before or at the same time as Confucius, it can be said that the above-mentioned law cannot be established. We cannot say this, because the era of the book "Lao Tzu" is precisely the object of this debate. If some formal private works that are definitely from the Spring and Autumn period can be cited in addition to the book "Lao Tzu," that would be great, but unfortunately this is very difficult.

The second point is to look at it from the perspective of ideological struggle. Ideological struggle is a reflection of class struggle. A class must struggle against alien classes, especially hostile classes. A thought must struggle against alien thoughts, especially hostile thoughts. These are absolutely incompatible. However, Confucius, Mozi, and even Mencius did not struggle against Lao Tzu's thought, and did not even mention Lao Dan's name. The struggle between Mozi and Confucius was very fierce, and the struggle between Mencius and Mozi was even more fierce. Confucius praised famous people of his time, such as Zichan and Yan Pingzhong, but the Analects did not mention Lao Dan. Some people say that "Lao Peng" mentioned in the Analects is Lao Dan, but this is just a guess. Some people also say that "repaying resentment with virtue" mentioned in the Analects is Lao Tzu's theory, which is also a guess. Let's assume that these guesses are correct. We can still say that Confucius did not wage a struggle against the basic ideas in the book "Lao Tzu." Confucius advocated "fearing Heaven's Mandate" and "knowing Heaven's Mandate," but the book "Lao Tzu" added an old ancestor to "Heaven." Confucius emphasized "rites," but the book "Lao Tzu" said, "Rites are the thinness of loyalty and sincerity and the beginning of chaos." Confucius advocated establishing a "cultured and substantial," prosperous, and educated society, but Lao Tzu praised a "small country with few people" and a primitive and simple society. These are fundamentally contradictory ideas. Can they coexist peacefully?

Party A cannot say that Confucius did not know these ideas. Because they believe in traditional legends. According to legend, Confucius deliberately traveled hundreds of miles to consult Lao Dan. In their conversation, did Lao Dan only talk about rites without talking about opinions against rites? According to what is said in Zhuangzi's book, there was a debate between Confucius and Lao Dan, but in the debate, Confucius admitted defeat after Lao Dan's few words. Is that really the case? If Confucius really admitted defeat, and Confucius advocated "correcting mistakes without hesitation," how could he still insist on his erroneous views in the "Analects"? If Confucius did not admit defeat, why is there no reflection of these struggles in the "Analects"? If Confucius knew Lao Dan's thoughts as described in the book "Lao Tzu," Mencius, who learned from Confucius, must have also known. Why did Mencius in the book "Mencius" scold Yang Zhu and Mo Di and deeply hate them, but not even mention Lao Dan's name? Mencius called himself fond of debate, so why did he coexist peacefully with Lao Dan's thought? These are all difficult to understand.

The third point is to look at it from the development of pre-Qin philosophical thought. The development of all things is from low to high, from simple to complex. In terms of the human cognitive process, it is always from the specific to the general, from the particular to the abstract. Engels said in the preface to the development of Greek philosophy: "...in its first stage it quite naturally takes the unity of the infinitely diverse natural phenomena as something self-evident and seeks it in some definite corporeal thing, in some particular thing, as Thales does in water" ("Dialectics of Nature," p. 151). Thales was the earliest Greek philosopher, who believed that water was the origin of all things. Later, someone believed that "infinity" was the origin of all things, and water was a particular corporeal thing. "Infinity" is more general. Before the Spring and Autumn period, some people talked about "five elements," "yin and yang," and "eight trigrams" (each trigram represents a particular thing), which were relatively early ideas. Some of the main categories in the book "Lao Tzu," such as Dao, Constant, Non-being, Being, etc., whether we give them materialistic or idealistic interpretations, are all very abstract. These categories should have been gradually reached in the dialectical process of the Hundred Schools of Thought contending, criticizing each other, and improving each other over a fairly long period in the pre-Qin period. It is difficult to understand that there were categories and systems like those described in the book "Lao Tzu" before the beginning of the Hundred Schools of Thought contending.

The second and third points mentioned above are general laws that can be applied to the philosophical history of any nation. The first point can only be applied to the general academic development situation in pre-Qin China. Of course, some laws cannot be constructed into a framework and forcibly imposed on facts, creating a situation of "cutting the feet to fit the shoes." If we have solid and irrefutable evidence to prove that the basic philosophical ideas expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" are works of the Spring and Autumn period, we cannot simply pull it from the Spring and Autumn period to the Warring States period just because it does not conform to certain laws. But even in that case, we have to find out the reasons why it does not conform to certain laws. But now we do not have such evidence, nor do we have a way to explain the reasons why it does not conform to certain laws. In this case, we can only believe that the book "Lao Tzu," including the basic philosophical ideas it expounds, is a product of the Warring States period.

I believe that the origin of pre-Qin Taoist thought may be quite early, but becoming a system may be relatively late. According to what is recorded in the "Analects," Confucius met some so-called hermits when he traveled around the states. They all expressed some negative remarks about escaping reality. These people were the predecessors of the Taoist school. Their thoughts were also the predecessors of Taoist thought. These people were probably some fallen nobles or frustrated intellectuals. Taoist thought is the crystallization of the wishes of this class of people.

Lao Dan, who lived at the same time as Confucius, was also one of these people. He may also have had the idea of "valuing gentleness" and "non-action," but he did not yet have a philosophical system like that expounded in the book "Lao Tzu." He may not have had great prestige and influence at that time.

By the time of Mencius, Yang Zhu's influence was very great. He actually became a representative of Taoist thought. Mencius regarded him as a representative of Taoist thought and engaged in ideological struggle against him. Some people have raised this question: Mencius and Zhuangzi were contemporaries, so why did Mencius not engage in ideological struggle against Zhuangzi? Some people therefore say that Yang Zhu, whom Mencius criticized, was actually Zhuang Zhou. The name "Yang Zhu" is a transliteration of "Zhuang Zhou," and there was actually no one called Yang Zhu. This statement is certainly wrong. Mencius took Yang Zhu as the representative of Taoist thought and criticized him. If Mencius were to say what we say now, he would say that the philosophical thought of the school headed by Yang Zhu advocated "for myself" and "is without a ruler." This school includes Zhuangzi. This also explains why there is no ideological struggle against Mencius in Zhuangzi's book. Non-Confucian works in the pre-Qin period did not mention Mencius either, because they all took Confucius as the representative of Confucian thought. They criticized Confucius, which was to criticize the Confucian school headed by Confucius. Only Xunzi, because he was engaged in ideological struggle within the Confucian school, specifically mentioned Zisi and Meng Ke. After Mencius, the book "Lao Tzu" came out, and Zhuangzi's influence also expanded. The ideas of the book "Lao Tzu" and Zhuangzi are the development and expansion of Yang Zhu's ideas of self-interest. Therefore, they replaced Yang Zhu in terms of prestige and influence. Therefore, only the book "Lao Tzu" and Zhuangzi are criticized in Xunzi's book, and Yang Zhu is not mentioned. This also answers another question: According to what Mencius said, Yang Zhu's influence was very great and should have been a large school, so why did it suddenly become extinct after Mencius? In fact, it did not become extinct. The influence of this school became more and more extensive, but after Mencius, the representative of this school was no longer Yang Zhu, but the book "Lao Tzu" and Zhuangzi.

The above-mentioned view is also consistent with the "Tianxia" chapter. According to what we know now, Yang Zhu's thought is relatively simple. He put forward the slogan of "for myself" and "not doing it even if plucking out one hair would benefit the world," but he did not have a complete worldview system as the theoretical basis for these slogans. Therefore, the "Tianxia" chapter does not believe that he "has gained from the ancient Dao arts," and therefore did not put him forward. From Song Xing and Yin Wen onwards, they all have a complete cosmic system. From Zhuangzi's point of view, these systems are most complete in Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi arranged them according to chronological order and also according to logical order.

The author of the "Tianxia" chapter does not necessarily believe that the era of Lao Dan himself was closely before Zhuangzi, but he may believe that the establishment of this system was closely before Zhuangzi.

Some people believe that the book "Lao Tzu" was produced even after Zhuangzi. I think this is a bit too late. I think the book "Lao Tzu" was produced after the establishment of Mencius's thought system and before the establishment of Zhuangzi's system. Please note: The "after" and "before" mentioned here do not refer to the birth and death dates of Mencius and Zhuangzi, but to the order in which their thought systems were established. According to the birth and death dates, Mencius and Zhuangzi were almost contemporaries. The Warring States period was an era of rapid social transformation. In this process of rapid transformation, many thought systems may appear one after another in one person's lifetime. There is an order in which they appear, but the time intervals may not be very long. We have personally experienced this situation. Just from the "May Fourth" Movement to now, only forty years have passed, all within our lifetime. During this period, various thought systems have appeared. There is an order in which they appear, there is a struggle between them, but the time is only forty years. The situation in the Warring States period was similar.

This is all I have to say about the first question of the discussion on Lao Tzu for now. (To be continued tomorrow)
