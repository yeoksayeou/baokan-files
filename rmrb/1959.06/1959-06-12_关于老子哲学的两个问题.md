Two Questions Concerning Lao Tzu's Philosophy
Feng Youlan

Editor's Note: There was a relatively heated debate about Lao Tzu's philosophical thought at the academic discussion held in Beijing in early May. Some people believed that Lao Tzu's philosophical thought was basically materialistic, while others believed that Lao Tzu's philosophical thought was basically idealistic. This newspaper plans to publish two articles on these two different viewpoints for reference. Mr. Feng Youlan advocates the former viewpoint, and at the same time, he also puts forward his own views on the era in which the book "Lao Tzu" was produced and its relationship with Lao Tzu. Because his article is relatively long, we will publish it in two days.

The book "Lao Tzu" is "concise in wording but rich in meaning." Although it only has about five thousand words, it includes a complete philosophical system. Most of its sentences are in rhyme, making it truly a philosophical poem. As a philosophical paper, five thousand words are too short; but as a philosophical poem, five thousand words are quite long.

I say it is a philosophical poem not only because it has a rhyming form. In terms of content, it also has the characteristics of Chinese poetry, that is, after reading each chapter, one always feels that there is some "remaining meaning that is not fully expressed." This "unexpressed meaning" is not exactly the same for each reader. As a philosophical "poem," it is a very successful poem. But as a "philosophical" poem, it has a great shortcoming, because the feelings of each reader are different, and their understanding of Lao Tzu's philosophy will not be exactly the same.

The current discussions in the philosophical community about Lao Tzu's philosophy probably focus on two questions. The first question is about the era in which the book "Lao Tzu" was produced and what kind of relationship it has with Lao Tzu as a person. The second question is whether the philosophical thought system expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" is materialistic or idealistic. The first question has been entangled since the "May Fourth" Movement. The second question has gradually become the center of discussion after 1949.

Regarding the first question, most of the current researchers of the history of philosophy admit that there was a person named Lao Tzu, i.e., Lao Dan, who lived at the same time as or slightly before Confucius. They also admit that the book "Lao Tzu" was not written by Lao Dan himself, but was produced later. They also admit that the philosophical thought expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" may include some ideas belonging to Lao Dan himself, and some belonging to Lao Dan's later followers. But which part belongs to Lao Dan himself? This is the question that is currently being debated. Among the researchers of Chinese philosophy, some people believe that although the book "Lao Tzu" was produced later, the main and basic ideas in it belong to Lao Tzu himself. This group of people will be referred to as Party A below. Another group of people believes that since the book "Lao Tzu" was produced later, the basic and main philosophical ideas in it are also relatively late. This book may also include some of Lao Dan's own ideas, but those are relatively unimportant. This group of people will be referred to as Party B below. I belong to Party B.

In essence, this question boils down to whether the philosophical thought expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" is a thought of the late Spring and Autumn period, or a thought of the mid or late Warring States period? For the study of Chinese philosophy, this is certainly not a small question, because the philosophical thought system expounded in the book "Lao Tzu," whether it is materialistic or idealistic, occupies an important position in the pre-Qin period and has had a great influence on later generations. Without clarifying the era in which it appeared, we cannot have a correct understanding of the development of pre-Qin philosophical thought.

Regarding this question, both Parties A and B have put forward a lot of evidence, which all seem to be "well-founded and reasonable." It is impossible for me to list all the arguments of both sides here, but I can only briefly mention a few points to illustrate the complexity of this question.

One of the main methods for verifying the era of a work is to see which era the problems it reflects belong to. For example, the book "Lao Tzu" says: "Do not value the worthy, so that the people do not contend." "Valuing the worthy" was a political slogan put forward by Mozi. Lao Tzu's saying "Do not value the worthy" is to oppose the political slogan of the Mohists and establish an opposite side to the Mohists. Lao Tzu advocates "abandoning benevolence and discarding righteousness." Mozi and Mencius emphasized benevolence and righteousness, putting "benevolence" and "righteousness" on an equal footing. Lao Tzu's advocacy of "abandoning benevolence and discarding righteousness" is also to establish an opposite side to them. These points all prove that the era in which the book "Lao Tzu" appeared was the mid-Warring States period or slightly later.

This is one of Party B's arguments. Most of Party A also admit that the situations mentioned above exist, but they believe that these parts in the book "Lao Tzu" were supplemented and added by people of the Warring States period.

On the surface, Party A's explanation puts Party B in a difficult position, because this approach renders useless one of the main methods for verifying the era of a work. Party B spent a lot of effort proving that certain parts of the book "Lao Tzu" reflected problems of the Warring States period, not the late Spring and Autumn period. Party A only needs to say: Your verification may be correct, but these parts of the book "Lao Tzu" were supplemented and added by people of the Warring States period. With such a casual sentence or two, Party B is blocked.

Party B also uses similar methods for Party A. For example, Party A says: The "Bu Er" chapter of "Lüshi Chunqiu" clearly says "Lao Dan valued gentleness, and Confucius valued benevolence," Lao Dan was before Confucius. Party B says: We do not deny that there was a Lao Dan who "valued gentleness" before Confucius, we only believe that the basic and main philosophical ideas expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" are late. With such a casual sentence or two, Party A is also blocked. The debates on both sides are like toffee, with great elasticity.

Although both are toffee, I think Party B's reasons are more sufficient. Because a book produced later can include previous ideas, while a book produced earlier cannot include later ideas, it must be said that the later ideas were added and supplemented by later generations. Strictly speaking, if Party A says that certain parts of the book "Lao Tzu" were supplemented and added by people of the Warring States period, then it needs to provide some other evidence besides the inconsistency of ideas. It cannot be said that certain parts were supplemented and added in the Warring States period simply because the problems they reflect are from the Warring States period. Party A must prove from other aspects (style, textual research, etc.) that these parts were added later in order to break Party B's arguments. Otherwise, it will commit the logical fallacy of "begging the question."

Party A may say that although we cannot prove from other aspects that certain parts of the book "Lao Tzu" were supplemented and added by people of the Warring States period, we do have definite evidence to prove that the main and basic ideas expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" belong to Lao Dan himself. The main evidence is found in the "Tianxia" chapter of "Zhuangzi."

The "Tianxia" chapter of "Zhuangzi" gave an account of Lao Dan's philosophical thought. This account is indeed basically consistent with the philosophical thought expounded in the book "Lao Tzu." Although the "Tianxia" chapter was not necessarily written by Zhuangzi himself, it is a relatively serious philosophical history paper, which is something that everyone has recently admitted. Based on the philosophical thought of Lao Dan described in the "Tianxia" chapter, Party A concludes that the philosophical thought expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" is basically Lao Dan's philosophical thought. This evidence is relatively strong.

But things are not that simple. The "Tianxia" chapter is a relatively serious philosophical history paper. Its order of narrating the various schools is obviously based on a standard, and it does not simply talk about whichever school comes to mind first. Party B believes that this standard is the chronological order. The "Tianxia" chapter first introduces the Confucian school, then the Mohist school, and then the Taoist school. The Taoist school is further divided into four factions. Among these four factions, it first introduces Song Xing and Yin Wen, then Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao, then Guan Yin and Lao Dan, and then Zhuang Zhou. Party B believes that according to this order in the "Tianxia" chapter, the philosophical thought system expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" occurred before Zhuangzi, but not long before.

Mr. Guo Moruo believes that the book "Lao Tzu" was written by Huan Yuan during the Warring States period; Huan Yuan was also Guan Yin. According to this textual research, the era of the book "Lao Tzu" is roughly consistent with the order arranged in the "Tianxia" chapter. However, Guo Lao also believes based on the "Tianxia" chapter that although Huan Yuan wrote the book "Lao Tzu," the basic ideas of this book still belong to Lao Dan of the Spring and Autumn period. This raises a question. If the basic ideas of the book "Lao Tzu" still belong to Lao Dan of the Spring and Autumn period, then Lao Dan is the founder of Taoism, and Guan Yin is just a later follower. However, the "Tianxia" chapter puts Guan Yin before Lao Dan when narrating Guan Yin and Lao Dan. There must be a reason for this. At least we can believe that although the "Tianxia" chapter does not necessarily believe that Lao Dan himself was a person of the Warring States period, the philosophical system of the book "Lao Tzu" was established during the Warring States period.

Regarding this question, Party A also has its own explanation. They believe that the standard for narrating the order of the various schools in the "Tianxia" chapter is not the chronological order, but the logical order. The author of the "Tianxia" chapter believes that Zhuangzi's philosophical thought is the best and most complete, so it is placed last. The next most complete is the philosophical thought of Guan Yin and Lao Dan, and the next is the philosophical thought of Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao. According to this reasoning, the philosophical thought of the Confucian school is the least complete. Therefore, the "Tianxia" chapter puts it first.

This statement also has some truth. From Song Xing and Yin Wen to Zhuang Zhou, let's temporarily put aside the distinction between their materialistic and idealistic thoughts and focus solely on the completeness of the system and the meticulousness of the debate. There is indeed a step-by-step progression. Zhuangzi's philosophical thought has indeed reached the peak of pre-Qin Taoist idealism. From the development of Taoist idealism, there is indeed a logical order.

However, the logical order and the chronological order should be unified. I will talk about this point below. Therefore, although Party A's views are different from Party B's views, from Party B's point of view, Party A's views have not overturned Party B's views, but have actually strengthened Party B's views.

There is a lot of debate between Party A and Party B about the era of the book "Lao Tzu." I have only given one example above to illustrate the complexity of this question. The evidence presented by either side cannot convince the other. The two sides are fighting back and forth, making it difficult to distinguish the winner.

I believe that focusing solely on arguing about a specific piece of evidence cannot solve the problem. We must first look at it from a broader perspective. From a broader perspective, there are three points worth noting.

The first point is to look at the general academic development situation in the pre-Qin period. Starting from Zhang Xuecheng of the Qing Dynasty, the historical community has gradually recognized a law regarding the academic development of the pre-Qin period. That is, before Confucius, "there was no such thing as private writing." Private writing came with private teaching. In the era of slave-owner aristocracy rule, culture and academics were controlled by the aristocracy. The many knowledgeable slaves they raised actually controlled academics and culture. They did not control it in a private capacity, but in the name of the rulers or the state. This is what is called "learning in the government." After the rule of the slave-owner aristocracy began to collapse, there was private teaching. However, in the early stages of private teaching, there were still no formal private writings. They only discussed matters and expressed some opinions, without leaving specific issues to make general treatises. For example, "Analects" is not a formal work of Confucius, but only a record of some of his speeches on certain issues by his students. Mozi also did not have formal writings. The works belonging to the early Mohist school were also records of Mozi's speeches by his students, so each chapter begins with "Zi Mozi said." Of course, Mozi's speeches are much more detailed than Confucius's speeches. This is the progress of the times.

The book "Lao Tzu" is a formal private work. It is inconsistent with the above-mentioned law to say that it came out before Confucius. We cannot conversely say that because the book "Lao Tzu" came out before or at the same time as Confucius, it can be said that the above-mentioned law cannot be established. We cannot say this, because the era of the book "Lao Tzu" is precisely the object of this debate. If some formal private works that are definitely from the Spring and Autumn period can be cited in addition to the book "Lao Tzu," that would be great, but unfortunately this is very difficult.

The second point is to look at it from the perspective of ideological struggle. Ideological struggle is a reflection of class struggle. A class must struggle against alien classes, especially hostile classes. A thought must struggle against alien thoughts, especially hostile thoughts. These are absolutely incompatible. However, Confucius, Mozi, and even Mencius did not struggle against Lao Tzu's thought, and did not even mention Lao Dan's name. The struggle between Mozi and Confucius was very fierce, and the struggle between Mencius and Mozi was even more fierce. Confucius praised famous people of his time, such as Zichan and Yan Pingzhong, but the Analects did not mention Lao Dan. Some people say that "Lao Peng" mentioned in the Analects is Lao Dan, but this is just a guess. Some people also say that "repaying resentment with virtue" mentioned in the Analects is Lao Tzu's theory, which is also a guess. Let's assume that these guesses are correct. We can still say that Confucius did not wage a struggle against the basic ideas in the book "Lao Tzu." Confucius advocated "fearing Heaven's Mandate" and "knowing Heaven's Mandate," but the book "Lao Tzu" added an old ancestor to "Heaven." Confucius emphasized "rites," but the book "Lao Tzu" said, "Rites are the thinness of loyalty and sincerity and the beginning of chaos." Confucius advocated establishing a "cultured and substantial," prosperous, and educated society, but Lao Tzu praised a "small country with few people" and a primitive and simple society. These are fundamentally contradictory ideas. Can they coexist peacefully?

Party A cannot say that Confucius did not know these ideas. Because they believe in traditional legends. According to legend, Confucius deliberately traveled hundreds of miles to consult Lao Dan. In their conversation, did Lao Dan only talk about rites without talking about opinions against rites? According to what is said in Zhuangzi's book, there was a debate between Confucius and Lao Dan, but in the debate, Confucius admitted defeat after Lao Dan's few words. Is that really the case? If Confucius really admitted defeat, and Confucius advocated "correcting mistakes without hesitation," how could he still insist on his erroneous views in the "Analects"? If Confucius did not admit defeat, why is there no reflection of these struggles in the "Analects"? If Confucius knew Lao Dan's thoughts as described in the book "Lao Tzu," Mencius, who learned from Confucius, must have also known. Why did Mencius in the book "Mencius" scold Yang Zhu and Mo Di and deeply hate them, but not even mention Lao Dan's name? Mencius called himself fond of debate, so why did he coexist peacefully with Lao Dan's thought? These are all difficult to understand.

The third point is to look at it from the development of pre-Qin philosophical thought. The development of all things is from low to high, from simple to complex. In terms of the human cognitive process, it is always from the specific to the general, from the particular to the abstract. Engels said in the preface to the development of Greek philosophy: "...in its first stage it quite naturally takes the unity of the infinitely diverse natural phenomena as something self-evident and seeks it in some definite corporeal thing, in some particular thing, as Thales does in water" ("Dialectics of Nature," p. 151). Thales was the earliest Greek philosopher, who believed that water was the origin of all things. Later, someone believed that "infinity" was the origin of all things, and water was a particular corporeal thing. "Infinity" is more general. Before the Spring and Autumn period, some people talked about "five elements," "yin and yang," and "eight trigrams" (each trigram represents a particular thing), which were relatively early ideas. Some of the main categories in the book "Lao Tzu," such as Dao, Constant, Non-being, Being, etc., whether we give them materialistic or idealistic interpretations, are all very abstract. These categories should have been gradually reached in the dialectical process of the Hundred Schools of Thought contending, criticizing each other, and improving each other over a fairly long period in the pre-Qin period. It is difficult to understand that there were categories and systems like those described in the book "Lao Tzu" before the beginning of the Hundred Schools of Thought contending.

The second and third points mentioned above are general laws that can be applied to the philosophical history of any nation. The first point can only be applied to the general academic development situation in pre-Qin China. Of course, some laws cannot be constructed into a framework and forcibly imposed on facts, creating a situation of "cutting the feet to fit the shoes." If we have solid and irrefutable evidence to prove that the basic philosophical ideas expounded in the book "Lao Tzu" are works of the Spring and Autumn period, we cannot simply pull it from the Spring and Autumn period to the Warring States period just because it does not conform to certain laws. But even in that case, we have to find out the reasons why it does not conform to certain laws. But now we do not have such evidence, nor do we have a way to explain the reasons why it does not conform to certain laws. In this case, we can only believe that the book "Lao Tzu," including the basic philosophical ideas it expounds, is a product of the Warring States period.

I believe that the origin of pre-Qin Taoist thought may be quite early, but becoming a system may be relatively late. According to what is recorded in the "Analects," Confucius met some so-called hermits when he traveled around the states. They all expressed some negative remarks about escaping reality. These people were the predecessors of the Taoist school. Their thoughts were also the predecessors of Taoist thought. These people were probably some fallen nobles or frustrated intellectuals. Taoist thought is the crystallization of the wishes of this class of people.

Lao Dan, who lived at the same time as Confucius, was also one of these people. He may also have had the idea of "valuing gentleness" and "non-action," but he did not yet have a philosophical system like that expounded in the book "Lao Tzu." He may not have had great prestige and influence at that time.

By the time of Mencius, Yang Zhu's influence was very great. He actually became a representative of Taoist thought. Mencius regarded him as a representative of Taoist thought and engaged in ideological struggle against him. Some people have raised this question: Mencius and Zhuangzi were contemporaries, so why did Mencius not engage in ideological struggle against Zhuangzi? Some people therefore say that Yang Zhu, whom Mencius criticized, was actually Zhuang Zhou. The name "Yang Zhu" is a transliteration of "Zhuang Zhou," and there was actually no one called Yang Zhu. This statement is certainly wrong. Mencius took Yang Zhu as the representative of Taoist thought and criticized him. If Mencius were to say what we say now, he would say that the philosophical thought of the school headed by Yang Zhu advocated "for myself" and "is without a ruler." This school includes Zhuangzi. This also explains why there is no ideological struggle against Mencius in Zhuangzi's book. Non-Confucian works in the pre-Qin period did not mention Mencius either, because they all took Confucius as the representative of Confucian thought. They criticized Confucius, which was to criticize the Confucian school headed by Confucius. Only Xunzi, because he was engaged in ideological struggle within the Confucian school, specifically mentioned Zisi and Meng Ke. After Mencius, the book "Lao Tzu" came out, and Zhuangzi's influence also expanded. The ideas of the book "Lao Tzu" and Zhuangzi are the development and expansion of Yang Zhu's ideas of self-interest. Therefore, they replaced Yang Zhu in terms of prestige and influence. Therefore, only the book "Lao Tzu" and Zhuangzi are criticized in Xunzi's book, and Yang Zhu is not mentioned. This also answers another question: According to what Mencius said, Yang Zhu's influence was very great and should have been a large school, so why did it suddenly become extinct after Mencius? In fact, it did not become extinct. The influence of this school became more and more extensive, but after Mencius, the representative of this school was no longer Yang Zhu, but the book "Lao Tzu" and Zhuangzi.

The above-mentioned view is also consistent with the "Tianxia" chapter. According to what we know now, Yang Zhu's thought is relatively simple. He put forward the slogan of "for myself" and "not doing it even if plucking out one hair would benefit the world," but he did not have a complete worldview system as the theoretical basis for these slogans. Therefore, the "Tianxia" chapter does not believe that he "has gained from the ancient Dao arts," and therefore did not put him forward. From Song Xing and Yin Wen onwards, they all have a complete cosmic system. From Zhuangzi's point of view, these systems are most complete in Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi arranged them according to chronological order and also according to logical order.

The author of the "Tianxia" chapter does not necessarily believe that the era of Lao Dan himself was closely before Zhuangzi, but he may believe that the establishment of this system was closely before Zhuangzi.

Some people believe that the book "Lao Tzu" was produced even after Zhuangzi. I think this is a bit too late. I think the book "Lao Tzu" was produced after the establishment of Mencius's thought system and before the establishment of Zhuangzi's system. Please note: The "after" and "before" mentioned here do not refer to the birth and death dates of Mencius and Zhuangzi, but to the order in which their thought systems were established. According to the birth and death dates, Mencius and Zhuangzi were almost contemporaries. The Warring States period was an era of rapid social transformation. In this process of rapid transformation, many thought systems may appear one after another in one person's lifetime. There is an order in which they appear, but the time intervals may not be very long. We have personally experienced this situation. Just from the "May Fourth" Movement to now, only forty years have passed, all within our lifetime. During this period, various thought systems have appeared. There is an order in which they appear, there is a struggle between them, but the time is only forty years. The situation in the Warring States period was similar.

This is all I have to say about the first question of the discussion on Lao Tzu for now. (To be continued tomorrow)

### 关于老子哲学的两个问题

    关于老子哲学的两个问题
    冯友兰
    编者按：关于老子的哲学思想，在5月初北京举行的学术讨论会上有过比较热烈的争论，一部分人认为，老子的哲学思想基本上是唯物主义的，还有一部分人认为，老子的哲学思想基本上是唯心主义的。本报准备就这两种不同的观点，发表两篇文章，以供参考。冯友兰先生是主张前一种观点的，同时他对“老子”这部书产生的时代以及它同老子的关系，也提出了自己的看法。他的这篇文章，因为篇幅较长，我们将分两天发表。
    老子这部书“文约义丰”。虽然只有五千来字，但包括了一个完整的哲学体系。它的字句大部分用韵，实在是一首哲学诗。作为一篇哲学论文看，五千来字是太短了；但是作为一首哲学诗看，五千来字也就是很长的了。
    我说它是一首哲学诗，还不仅在于它有用韵的形式。在内容上它也有中国诗所具有的特点，那就是，每一章在读过以后，总觉得还有些“有余不尽之意”。这个“不尽之意”各个读者所感受的并不完全相同。作为哲学“诗”说，这是很成功的一首诗。但是作为“哲学”诗说，它却是有很大的缺点，因为各个读者的感受不同，他们所了解的老子哲学，也就不会完全一样。
    现在哲学界关于老子哲学的讨论，大概集中在两个问题上。第一个问题是关于老子这部书是什么时代的产品，它与老子这个人有什么样的关系。第二个问题是，老子这部书所讲的哲学思想体系，究竟是唯物主义的或是唯心主义的。第一个问题从“五四”以来，就纠缠不清。第二个问题是1949年后，才日益成为讨论的中心。
    关于第一个问题，现在的哲学史工作者们，多数都承认在孔子同时或稍前有老子这个人，即老聃，也都承认老子这部书不是老聃亲手写的，这部书比较晚出，也都承认老子这部书所讲的哲学思想，可能有一部分属于老聃本人，有一部分是属于老聃的后学。可是其中哪一部分是属于老聃本人的呢？这是现在争论的问题。在中国哲学史工作者们中间，有一部分人认为，老子这部书虽然晚出，但是其中主要的和基本的思想，却是属于老子本人的，这一部分人下边称为甲方。还有一部分人认为老子这部书既然晚出，其中的基本的和主要的哲学思想，也就是比较晚出的了；这部书也可能包括一些老聃本人思想，但是那是比较不重要的。这一部分人以下称为乙方。我是属于乙方的。
    这个问题，归宗起来说，就是老子这部书所讲的哲学思想，究竟是春秋末期的思想呢，或是战国中期或末期的思想？就中国哲学史的研究说，这当然不是一个小问题，因为老子这部书所讲的哲学思想体系，无论它是唯物主义的或者是唯心主义的，在先秦都占重要的地位，对于后来也有很大的影响。不把它出现的时代搞清楚，对于先秦哲学思想的发展，就不能有正确的认识。
    关于这个问题，甲乙两方都举出了不少的证据，看起来都是
  “持之有故言之成理”。我在这里不可能把两方的论据都一一列举出来，只能够略举几点，说明这个问题的复杂性。
    我们考订一个著作的时代的一个主要方法，就是看它所反映的问题是哪个时代的问题。譬如老子书里说：“不尚贤，使民不争”。“尚贤”是墨子所提出的政治斗争的口号。老子说“不尚贤”，是反对墨家的政治口号，同墨家树立一个对立面。老子主张
  “绝仁弃义”。墨子和孟子注重仁义，把“仁”、“义”平列地提出来。老子主张“绝仁弃义”，这也是同他们树立一个对立面。像这些地方都证明老子书出现的时代，是战国中期或者稍后。
    这是乙方的论据之一。甲方，多数的人也承认上面所说的这些情况是有的，但是他们认为老子书中的这些部分是战国时候的人所补充追加的。
    在表面上看起来，甲方的这种解释很使乙方陷于困难，因为这种作法，使一般考订一个著作的时代的一个主要方法，归于无用。乙方费了很大的气力，证明老子书中的某些部分所反映的问题是战国时代的，不是春秋末期的。甲方只须说：你的考证也许不错，可是老子书的这些部分是战国时候的人补充追加上去的。这样轻描淡写地一两句话，就把乙方挡回去了。
    乙方对于甲方，也用类似的方法。譬如甲方说：“吕氏春秋”“不二”篇明明说“老聃贵柔，孔子贵仁”，老聃是在孔子前面的。乙方说：我们本来不否认在孔子以前，有个“贵柔”的老聃，我们只是认为老子书中所讲的基本的和主要的哲学思想是晚出。这样轻描淡写的一两句话，也把甲方挡回去了。双方的辩论都和牛皮糖一样，有很大的伸缩性。
    虽然都是牛皮糖，可是我觉得乙方的理由比较充足一些。因为晚出的书可以包括以前的思想，而早出的书不能包括以后的思想，必需说，晚出的思想是后人的追加补充。严格地说，如果甲方说老子书的某些部分是战国时人补充追加上去的，那就需要于思想不合之外，另举一些别的证据。不能说某些部分是战国时代补充追加上去的，因为它所反映的问题是战国时的。甲方必须从别的方面（文体、文字考订等）证明这些部分是后加的，才可以破乙方的论据。不然的话，就犯了逻辑上所谓“丐辞”的错误。
    甲方可以说，我们虽然不能从别的方面证明老子书中某些部分是战国时候的人补充追加上去的，但是我们确切有证据证明老子书所讲的主要的和基本的思想，是属于老聃本人的，主要的证据见于“庄子”“天下篇”。
    “庄子天下篇”对于老聃的哲学思想作了一个叙述。这个叙述也确是跟老子书所讲的哲学思想，基本上是相合的。“天下篇”虽不一定是庄子本人作的，但是一篇比较严肃的哲学史论文，这一点是近来大家都承认的。甲方根据庄子“天下篇”所叙述的老聃的哲学思想，断定老子书所讲的哲学思想，基本上就是老聃的哲学思想。这个证据是比较强有力的。
    但是事情并不这样简单。“天下篇”是一篇比较严肃的哲学史论文，它叙述各家的先后次序，显然是有一个标准，并不是随便先想到哪一家就先讲哪一家。乙方认为这个标准就是时代的先后。“天下篇”先序儒家，其次序墨家，再其次序道家。道家中又分四派，在这四派里边，它先序宋鈃尹文，其次序彭蒙田骈慎到，再其次序关尹老聃，再其次序庄周。乙方认为照“天下篇”的这个次序，老子书所讲的哲学思想体系发生在庄子以前，但不是很久。
    郭沫若先生认为老子书是战国时候环渊作的；环渊也就是关尹。照这个考证，老子书的时代，也就是跟“天下篇”所排的次序大致相合。可是郭老又根据“天下篇”认为环渊虽然作了老子书，但是这本书的基本思想，还是属于春秋时代的老聃。这就有个问题。如果老子书的基本思想，还是属于春秋时代的老聃，那么老聃就是道家的创始者，关尹不过是个后学。可是“天下篇”在叙述关尹老聃的时候，把关尹放在前面，老聃放在后面。这必定有个原因。至少我们可以认为“天下篇”虽然不一定认为老聃其人是战国时的人，但是老子书的哲学体系是在战国时才成立的。
    关于这个问题，甲方也有自己的说法，他们认为“天下篇”叙述各家先后的标准，不是时代的先后，而是逻辑的先后。“天下篇”的作者认为庄子的哲学思想是最好的，最完整的，所以放在最后。其次完整的是关尹老聃的哲学思想，再其次是彭蒙田骈慎到的哲学思想。照这样的推上去，儒家的哲学思想最不行。所以“天下篇”把它放在最先。
    这个说法也有一定道理。从宋鈃尹文到庄周，我们暂且不论他们思想的唯物主义和唯心主义的分别，专就体系的完整和辩论的细致说，确是一步进一步。庄子的哲学思想确是达到了先秦道家唯心主义的顶峰。从道家的唯心主义的发展看，确是有一个逻辑的次序。
    但是逻辑的先后和时代的先后应该是统一的。这一点我在下面还要谈到。所以甲方的看法跟乙方的看法虽有不同，但是从乙方的观点看，甲方的看法并没有推翻乙方的看法，而实际上是加强了乙方的看法。
    关于老子书的时代问题，甲乙两方辩论很多，我上边只是举一个例，说明这问题的复杂性。无论哪一方所举的证据，都不能使对方心服。两方面都是一个回合一个回合地杀来杀去，杀得难解难分。
    我认为这样专就某一个证据杀来杀去，是不能解决问题的。我们要先从大处看一看。从大处看，有三点值得注意。
    第一点，从先秦的一般的学术发展的情况看。从清朝的章学诚开始，历史学界都逐渐承认了一个关于先秦的学术发展的规律。那就是，在孔子以前“无私人著作之事”，私人著作是跟着私人讲学来的。在奴隶主贵族统治的时代，文化和学术都掌握在贵族手里。他们所养的许多有知识的奴隶，实际上掌握了学术文化，他们不是以私人资格，而是以统治者或国家的名义掌握的。这就是所谓“学在官府”。到了奴隶主贵族的统治开始崩溃以后，这才有私人讲学的事情。但是在私人讲学的初期，也还没有私人的正式著述。他们只是就事论，发表些意见，不离开具体问题作一般的论著。例如“论语”并不是孔子的正式著述，不过是学生们记述了他的一部分关于某些问题的讲话。墨子也没有正式的著述，属于早期墨家的著作，也都是墨子的学生们记录墨子的讲话，所以每篇开始都说是“子墨子言曰”。当然，墨子的讲话，跟孔子的讲话，比较起来是细致得多了。这就是时代的进步。
    老子书是一部正式的私人著作。我们说它出在孔子以前，是不合于上面所说的规律的。我们不能反过来说，因为老子书出在孔子以前，或其同时，这就可以说，上面所说的规律是不能成立的。我们不能这样说，因为老子书的时代，正是这个争论的对象。如果于老子书以外能举出一些确切是春秋时代的私人正式著作，那就好了，可惜这是很困难的。
    第二点，从思想斗争的观点看。思想斗争是阶级斗争的反映。一个阶级对于异己的阶级，特别是敌对的阶级，一定要斗争。一种思想遇见异己的思想，特别是敌对的思想，一定要斗争。这都是绝对不能和平共处的。可是孔子墨子一直到孟子，都没有跟老子的思想作斗争，甚至都没有提到老聃的名字。墨子和孔子的斗争是很激烈的，孟子和墨子的斗争，就更激烈了。孔子对于他同时的有名的人，如子产、晏平仲等，都有所称道，但是论语中对于老聃就没提过。有人说，论语中所说的“老彭”就是老聃，这不过是一种猜想。也有人说，论语中所说的“以德报怨”就是老子的学说，这也是一种猜想。就假定这猜想都不错吧。我们还是可以说，孔子对于老子书中的基本思想，没有进行斗争。孔子主张“畏天命”“知天命”，老子书却给“天”加上一个老祖宗。孔子注重“礼”，老子书说，“礼者，忠信之薄而乱之首”。孔子主张建立“文质彬彬”又庶又富，又有教化的社会，老子却赞美“小国寡民”原始素朴的社会。这都是从根本上相矛盾的思想。它们能够和平共处吗？
    甲方不能说孔子不知道这些思想。因为他们是相信传统的传说的。照传说，孔子特意走了几百里路去向老聃请教。在他们的谈话中间，老聃就只谈礼，而不谈反对礼的意见么？照庄子书里边所说的，孔子与老聃之间是有过辩论，但是在辩论之中，在老聃的三言两语以后，孔子就认输败阵下来。事情果真是这样吗？如果孔子真是认了输，孔子是主张“过则无惮改”的，他怎么还在
  “论语”中坚持他的错误见解？如果孔子没有认输，这些斗争的情况怎么在“论语”中没有一点反映？如果孔子知道老聃的像老子书中所说的那些思想，孟子是学孔子的，也一定知道。为什么在孟子书里，孟子对杨朱墨翟都是破口大骂，深恶痛绝，而对于老聃就连名字也不提？孟子自称为好辩，为什么对于老聃的思想却和平共处呢？这些都是难以理解的。
    第三点，从先秦哲学思想的发展看，一切事物的发展都是从低级到高级，从简单到复杂。就人的认识过程说，总是从具体到一般，从特殊到概括。恩格斯在序希腊哲学发展的时候说：……它在它自己发展的最初阶段便十分自然地把自然现象无限多样性的统一，看作自明的东西，并且就在某个一定的有形体的东西中，在一个特殊的东西中去寻找这个统一，如塔利斯在水里去寻找一样。”（“自然辩论法”页151）塔利斯是希腊最早的哲学家，认为水是万物的根源，后来有人认为“无限”是万物的根源，水是特殊有形体的东西。“无限”就比较一般的了。在春秋以前，就有人讲“五行”“阴阳”“八卦”（每卦都代表一种特殊的东西），这都是比较早期的思想。老子书中一些主要的范畴例如道、常、无、有等等，无论我们给它们唯物主义的或唯心主义的解释，都是很概括的。这些范畴，应该是在先秦相当长期的百家争鸣，互相批判，互相提高的辩证的过程中，才能逐渐达到的。要说是在百家争鸣开始以前就有像老子书里所讲的那样的范畴和体系，这是很难理解的。
    上面所说的第二点，第三点，是一般的规律，对于任何民族的哲学史都可以适用的，第一点只对于中国先秦一般学术发展的情况可以适用。当然，不可以把一些规律构成一个框子，硬加在事实的上面，造成一个“削足适履”的情况。如果我们有确实不可以反驳的证据证明老子书中所讲的基本哲学思想是春秋时期的作品，我们也不能仅仅因为它不合于某些规律，硬把它由春秋时代拉到战国时代。但即是有那样情况，我们也得找出来它所以不合于某些规律的原因。可是现在我们没有这样的证据，也没有方法说出它所以不合某些规律的理由。在这种情况下，我们只能相信老子书包括所讲的基本哲学思想，是战国时代的产物。
    我认为先秦道家思想的起源，可能是相当早的，但是成为一个体系可能比较晚。照“论语”中所记载的，孔子周游列国时，遇见了一些所谓隐者。他们都发表了一些逃避现实的消极言论。这些人就是道家的前身。他们的思想也就是道家思想的前身。他们这些人大概都是一些没落的贵族或不得志的知识分子。道家的思想就是这一个阶层的人愿望的结晶。
    跟孔子同时的老聃，也是这些人中之一。他可能也有“贵柔”和“无为”的思想，但是他还没有像老子书中所讲的那样的哲学体系。他在当时也未必有很大的声望和影响。
    到了孟子的时候，杨朱的影响很大。他实际上成为道家思想的代表人物。孟子就把他作为道家思想的代表人物，向他进行思想斗争。有人提出这个问题：孟子和庄子是同时，为什么孟子没有向庄子进行思想斗争。有人因此就说，孟子所批评的杨朱，实在就是庄周。“杨朱”这个名字，就是“庄周”一音之转，实际上并没有一个人叫做杨朱。这种说法当然是错误的。孟子是以杨朱为道家思想的代表，而向他进行批判。孟子如果说我们现在的话，他会说，以杨朱为首的那一派哲学思想，主张“为我”“是无君也”。这一派就包括庄子在内。这也说明，庄子书里边为什么也没有对于孟子进行思想斗争。先秦非儒家的著作里也都没有提到孟子，因为他们都是以孔子为儒家思想的代表。他们批评孔子就是批评以孔子为首的儒家。只有荀子因为在儒家内进行思想斗争，所以就特别提出了子思和孟轲。到了孟子以后，老子书出来了，庄子的影响也扩大了，老子书和庄子的思想是杨朱为我思想的发展和扩大，因此他们在声望和影响上就替代了杨朱。因此在荀子书里边就只批判老子和庄子，而不提杨朱了。这也回答了另外一个问题：照孟子所说的，杨朱的影响是很大的，应该是很大的一个学派，为什么在孟子以后就忽然绝灭了呢？其实并没有绝灭，这个学派的影响是越来越扩大，不过从孟子以后，这个学派的代表人物，已竟不是杨朱，而是老子书和庄子了。
    上面所说的这样的看法，跟“天下篇”也是相合的。照我们现在所知道的，杨朱的思想比较简单，他提出了“为我”和“拔一毛而利天下不为”的口号，但是他没有一个整个的世界观体系，作为这些口号的理论的基础。所以“天下篇”就不认为“有得于古之道术”，因而也没有把它提出来。宋鈃尹文以下，都有一个整个的宇宙观体系，这些体系，从庄子的观点看，以庄子为最完整。庄子就按时代的先后，同时也按逻辑的次序，把它排列起来。
  “天下篇”的作者，并不一定认为老聃本人的时代就紧紧在庄子以前，但可能认为这个体系的成立，是紧紧地在庄子以前。
    有些人认为老子书还出在庄子以后。我觉得这就太晚一些，我认为老子书是出在孟子的思想体系成立以后，庄子的体系成立以前。请注意：这里所说的以后和以前，并不是就孟子和庄子两个人生卒年代说，而是就他们的思想体系成立的先后说。若按生卒年代说，孟子和庄子差不多是同时的。战国是个社会急剧转变的时代。在这个急剧转变的过程中，在一人的一生之间，就可能有很多思想体系先后出现。出现有先后，但是间隔时间可能并不很长。这种情况，我们是亲自经过的。就从“五四”到现在说吧，仅仅四十年的时间，都在我们一生之中。其间出现了各种各样的思想体系。他们的出现是有先后的，他们中间是有斗争的，可是时间也就只有四十年。战国时候的情况，也仿佛是这个样子。
    关于老子讨论的第一个问题，暂且谈至此。（明天续完）
