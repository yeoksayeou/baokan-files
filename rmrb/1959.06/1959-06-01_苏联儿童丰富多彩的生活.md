Soviet Children's Rich and Colorful Life

    At the Young Pioneer Palace

    At the head of Stopenihu Lane in the center of Moscow, there is a large courtyard with lush trees and a quiet scenery. Through the gaps in the trees, you can see two very beautiful two-story buildings built of red and white tiles. This is the Moscow City Young Pioneer Palace. Every afternoon, countless children wearing red scarves come here.

    The Moscow Young Pioneer Palace receives an average of more than 1,500 children every day. Children who like airplanes, rockets, and radios can participate in various technical learning groups, and children who like singing and drawing can participate in various art learning groups. There are more than 200 such learning groups. Each group has a full-time teacher to guide them. At first, children can only learn general technical knowledge and artistic appreciation here; many children, under careful and meticulous cultivation, develop a genuine interest in a certain field and gain opportunities for further study. More than 250 art enthusiasts who have come from this Young Pioneer Palace have won the title of various artists.

    The Moscow City Young Pioneer Palace Song and Dance Troupe is famous throughout the Soviet Union. Under the guidance of famous musicians, they can sing dozens of beautiful songs. They often hold formal performances, and have performed 48 times in the first half of this year, winning unanimous praise.

    The Moscow City Young Pioneer Palace has close ties with the Beijing Young Pioneer Palace. Gifts from Beijing have always been the children's favorite. In recent years, the friendship between children in the two countries has grown stronger through correspondence. When Soviet children receive letters from Chinese children, they happily run around looking for someone to translate. These letters are always passed around and read by many.

    At the sports field

    Across from the famous Dynamo Stadium in Moscow is the city's largest children's stadium, which is affiliated with the Moscow Young Pioneers' sports school. Every day, you can see groups of children going in and out of the gate, all of whom come here after school for regular physical exercise. Currently, 2,000 children receive after-school training here. Children can participate in classes such as track and field, fencing, gymnastics, cycling, checkers, soccer, and figure skating, according to their interests. First-class coaches and many master-level athletes guide the children. When we arrived at the fencing class, two pairs of children, aged about thirteen or fourteen, were practicing fencing, and sports master Rikoyanov was correcting their postures. He said that the fencing class is quite famous in Moscow.

    Many famous athletes often come here to perform for the children. The children's sports skills improve very quickly. Master athletes have emerged from figure skating, checkers and other classes. For example, checkers master Seyedolev was trained here. He started learning here at the age of nine, and recently won the National International Checkers Competition held in Kiev.

    At the Children's Theater

    There are indeed many places for children to relax in Moscow. There are five or six theaters alone, including two children's theaters, two puppet theaters, and the recently established shadow theater, etc. In addition, the circus, concert hall, and acrobatic theater often organize special performances for children.

    On a street to the right of Gorky Street, several beautiful buses stopped. As soon as the doors opened, a group of seven- and eight-year-old children ran out and crowded at the entrance of the Young Spectator Theater. A young female teacher lined them up and then led them into the theater in an orderly manner. This was the entire student body from the first to third grades of a collective farm school in the suburbs of Moscow who came to see a play. Today, the theater is staging the fairy tale "Two Maple Trees" written by Soviet playwright Schwartz. As soon as the curtain opened, hundreds of children's eyes focused on the stage, and their little hearts were completely attracted by the performance.

    Walking backstage, we saw the actors who serve the children. Some of them are only in their twenties and are actors trained by drama schools. But there are also older-generation artists here, such as Kolesnikov, a Honored Artist of the Russian Federation. He is over sixty years old and has been performing for children in the theater for more than thirty years. The roles he plays are the children's favorite. The theater director Golubovsky told us that their theater maintains close ties with various schools, and after the children watch their plays, they often organize discussion sessions. In the theater, we also saw many letters from students to the theater. One third-grade student wrote in a letter after watching "Two Maple Trees": "I like this play very much. How much Vasilyisa's mother, who loves labor, loves her children! After watching this play, I love my mother even more. My mother loves me just like Vasilyisa." Comrade Golubovsky told us that on "June 1" Children's Day, they send their greetings to the Chinese children and hope that the Chinese children's theater will achieve greater success.

    苏联儿童丰富多彩的生活
    在少先宫
    在莫斯科市中心斯托别尼胡同的一头，有一个碧树成荫、景色幽静的大院子。透过树林间隙可以见到两幢用红白瓷砖砌起的非常美丽的两层楼房。这就是莫斯科市少先宫。每天下午无数结着红领巾的孩子来到这里。
    莫斯科少先宫每天平均接待一千五百多个孩子。喜欢飞机、火箭、无线电的孩子可以参加各种技术学习小组，喜欢唱歌、绘图的孩子可以参加各种艺术学习小组。这样的学习小组一共有二百多个。每个小组都有专任老师指导。开头，孩子们在这儿只能学到一般性技术知识和文艺欣赏能力；也有许多孩子在认真、仔细的培养下，对某一部门具有了真正的爱好，获得了深造的机会。从这个少先宫出去的艺术爱好者，已有二百五十多人获得了各种艺术家的称号。
    莫斯科市少先宫歌舞团是全苏有名的。他们在有名的音乐家指导下，能唱数十只优美的歌曲。他们经常举行正式演出，今年上半年已经演出了四十八场，博得了一致的好评。
    莫斯科市少先宫同北京少先宫有着密切的联系。来自北京的礼品一直是孩子们最热爱的。近年来，两国孩子通信友谊增强了。中国孩子来信使接到信的苏联孩子高兴地到处奔走找人翻译。这些来信，总是一传十、十传百地被传读着。
    在运动场
    莫斯科著名的狄纳莫运动场斜对面，有一个全市最大的儿童体育场，这里有莫斯科少先队员运动场附设的儿童体育学校。每天可以看到成群的孩子在大门口进进出出，他们都是课后来到这里进行正规的体育锻炼的。目前有二千名孩子在这里受课余的锻炼。孩子们根据自己的兴趣，可以参加田径、击剑、体操、自行车、跳棋、足球、花样溜冰等班学习。指导孩子学习的有第一流的教练和许多健将级运动员。当我们来到击剑班时，两对年约十三四岁的孩子正在进行击剑练习，运动健将里科雅诺夫给他们纠正姿势。他说击剑班在莫斯科是相当有名望的。
    许多著名运动员经常到这里来为孩子们表演。孩子们的运动技巧提高得非常快，花样溜冰、跳棋等班都出过运动健将，如跳棋运动健将谢道列夫就是这里培养出来的，他从九岁起就在这里学习，不久前他在基辅举行的全国国际跳棋比赛中获得了胜利。
    在儿童剧院
    在莫斯科儿童休息的地方的确很多，仅只戏院就有五、六个，这里有两个儿童剧院，有两家木偶剧院，还有不久前成立的影子戏剧院等等。此外马戏院、音乐厅和杂技剧院还经常给儿童们组织特别的演出。
    在高尔基大街右侧的一条街上，几辆漂亮的公共汽车停了下来，门一打开，一群七、八岁的小孩子马上跑了出来，拥在少年剧院门口，一位年青的女教师把他们排成队，然后有秩序地走进剧院。这是莫斯科市郊一个集体农庄学校一年级到三年级的全体学生来看戏的。今天这里上演的是苏联剧作家施瓦尔兹编写的童话剧“两棵枫树”。幕一打开，几百个儿童的眼睛集中在台上，他们小小的心灵全被台上的表演吸引住了。
    走到后台时，我们看到了这些为儿童服务的演员，他们有的才二十几岁，是戏剧学校培养出来的演员。但是这里也有老一辈的艺术家，例如俄罗斯联邦功勋演员柯列斯尼可夫就是其中之一。他已经六十多岁了，在剧院里为儿童们演了三十多年戏，他扮演的角色是孩子们最喜欢看的。剧院导演戈鲁波夫斯基告诉我们说，他们剧院同各个学校保持着密切的联系，孩子看完他们的戏以后，经常还组织讨论会。在戏院里，我们还看到了许多学生给戏院的来信，有一个三年级的学生看完“两棵枫树”以后在信里写道：“这个戏我非常喜欢，爱好劳动的瓦西利夏母亲是多么喜爱自己的孩子呀！我看完这个戏以后，我更爱我的母亲了，我的母亲和瓦西利夏一样爱我。”戈鲁波夫斯基同志向我们说，在“六一”儿童节，他们向中国的小朋友问好，并且希望中国的儿童剧院取得更大的成绩。
