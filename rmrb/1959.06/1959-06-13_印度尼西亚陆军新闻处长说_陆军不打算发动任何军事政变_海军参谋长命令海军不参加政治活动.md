    据新华社雅加达12日电　印度尼西亚陆军新闻处处长哈索诺少校重申，印度尼西亚陆军既不打算发动任何军事政变，也无意成立军事革命委员会。他是在谈到争取解放西伊里安民族阵线副主席穆斯托波准将10日在向印度尼西亚民族通讯社记者发表的讲话时说这番话的。哈索诺说，穆斯托波所说的话反映了陆军的思想和情绪。穆斯托波说，印度尼西亚陆军不必采取类似邻国武装部队所采取的那些措施。据印度尼西亚民族通讯社说，穆斯托波还说，实际上陆军目前能够采取如发动军事政变的行动。但是这种事情是不会发生的，因为陆军仍然服从它的最高领导。
    据新华社雅加达11日电　目前正在欧洲访问的印度尼西亚海军参谋长苏比雅克托海军中将已经向海军全体官兵发出命令，号召他们遵守陆军当局发布的关于禁止政治活动的命令，并且宣布，这项命令也适用于海军的辖区。
