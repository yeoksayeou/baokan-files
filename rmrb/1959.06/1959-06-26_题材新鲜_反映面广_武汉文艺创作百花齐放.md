    Fresh Themes, Broad Coverage:
    Wuhan's Literary and Artistic Creation Blossoms

    (Our reporter Zhang Wei reports) Since the beginning of this year, Wuhan's literary and artistic creation has been flourishing, showing remarkable activity and prosperity.

    The number of full-length novels being completed one after another is more than in any previous year. "Gunshots on the Plain," which was finalized at the beginning of the year and has already been published in the second and third issues of "Harvest," tells the story of the people of the Hebei-Jizhong Plain fighting against the "mopping-up" operations under the leadership of the Party during the Anti-Japanese War. This novel was co-written by Li Xiaoming, the current Secretary of the Wuchang District Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, who participated in and led the struggle against the enemy at that time, and amateur author Han Anqing. The creation "Eternal Evergreen," with the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge as its theme, has also been finalized. The full-length novels currently being written or revised include "Man Will Conquer Nature" by Li Erzhong, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, reflecting Wuhan's flood control struggle, and "Yangtze Giant Wave" by Yu Jintang, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Committee, depicting Wuhan's underground struggle.

    Fresh themes and broad coverage are another feature of Wuhan's literary creation this year. The recently published novella "Studying in Yan'an" describes how the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an cultivated a large number of revolutionary youths with communist ideological awareness through the combination of education and labor during the Anti-Japanese War. This novel has received good reviews from readers for its theme and artistic expression.

    Professional writers also delve into life and help workers write factory histories. At present, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant has compiled more than 20,000 articles of various kinds for its factory history; workers from the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, the Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant, and the Wuchang Shipyard have written hundreds or thousands of articles for their factory histories. Currently, the writers working in the factories are assisting them in editing and processing.

    Dramatic creation is also thriving. At present, on the basis of delving into life, each troupe has created some plays reflecting real life. For example, the Han opera "Unquenchable Revolutionary Flame," the Chu opera "Willow Forest River," and the Ping opera "Green Sea and White Clouds" all have relatively exciting content. Various troupes are taking various measures to improve the quality of scripts and the effect of performances. One of the key repertoires of the Wuhan Han Opera Troupe, the newly compiled large-scale opera "Mu Guiying's Clever Strategy to Break the Tianmen Formation," was preliminarily finalized after repeated discussions and multiple revisions under the specific leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, the Municipal Bureau of Culture, and the Dramatists Association. In order to improve the artistic level of the performance, the relevant leadership drew outstanding directors and famous actors from the Han Opera, Peking Opera, and People's Art Theater to form a directing team to help the Han Opera Troupe rehearse.

    题材新鲜　反映面广
    武汉文艺创作百花齐放
    本报讯　记者张碨报道：今年以来，武汉市的文艺创作百花齐放，显得特别活跃和繁荣。
    正陆续脱稿的长篇小说，比以往任何一年都多。年初定稿，已在“收获”二、三期连续发表的“平原的枪声”，是描写抗日战争时期，冀中平原人民在党领导下反“扫荡”斗争的故事。这部小说，是由曾经参加和领导当时对敌斗争、现任中共武汉市武昌区委书记李晓明和业余作者韩安庆合写的。以长江大桥建设为主题的创作“万古长青”，也已定稿。正在创作或修改的长篇小说，还有中共武汉市委书记李尔重的反映武汉防汛斗争的“人定胜天”，市委统战部部长余金堂的描写武汉地下斗争的“长江巨浪”等。
    题材新鲜，反映的面广，是今年武汉文学创作的另一特点。刚出版的中篇小说“延安求学记”，是描写抗日战争期间延安抗大通过教育和劳动相结合，培养了大批具有共产主义思想觉悟的革命青年的作品。这部小说的题材和艺术表现方面，都获得了读者好评。
    专业作家，也深入生活，帮助职工编写工厂史。现在，武汉钢铁厂的工厂史，已编写各类稿件二万多篇；武汉重型机床厂、江岸车辆厂和武昌造船厂的职工，都写了成百上千篇工厂史的稿件。目前，下厂的作家们，正在协助他们编选加工。
    戏剧创作，也欣欣向荣。目前，各剧团在深入生活的基础上，都创作了一些反映现实生活的剧本。如汉剧“扑不灭的革命火焰”，楚剧“柳林河”，评剧“绿海白云”等内容都比较精彩。各剧团正采取各种措施，提高剧本质量和演出效果。武汉市汉剧团的重点剧目之一——新编的大型剧“穆桂英智破天门阵”，曾在武汉市委、市文化局、剧协具体领导下，经过反复讨论多次修改后，才初步定稿。为了提高演出的艺术水平，有关领导方面抽调了汉剧、京剧、人民艺术剧院的优秀导演和著名演员组成导演团，帮助汉剧团排演。
