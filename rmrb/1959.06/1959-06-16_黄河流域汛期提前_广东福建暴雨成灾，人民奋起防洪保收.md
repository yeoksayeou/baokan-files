    Yellow River Flood Season Arrives Early
    Heavy Rains in Guangdong and Fujian Cause Disaster, People Fight Floods and Protect Harvests
    Xinhua News Agency: The Yellow River has entered flood season half a month earlier this year. On the 8th, the Yellow River basin experienced widespread rainfall, causing water levels to rise sharply. On the 10th, the flow rate at Huayuankou Station reached 2,000 cubic meters per second. According to weather forecasts, the Yellow River basin will continue to experience rainfall in the coming days, and flood peaks will appear repeatedly. Currently, people along the river are stepping up flood prevention preparations.
    Another report: Continuous heavy rains in various parts of Guangdong and the coastal areas of Fujian have caused disasters. The county towns of Heyuan, Boluo, and Zengcheng, the centers of the heavy rainfall in Guangdong, were flooded, and Huiyang county town is still surrounded by floodwaters. More than 3.5 million mu of cultivated land in the province has been flooded to varying degrees. The flood prevention and rescue forces of the two provinces are fighting the floods.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 15: In recent days, continuous rainfall in the Yellow River basin has caused the Yellow River water level to rise, entering the flood season more than half a month early. Various regions along the river are actively organizing flood prevention teams and preparing flood prevention materials.
    This year, flood prevention preparations for the Yellow River started particularly early. From May 11th to 13th, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the provinces of Henan and Shandong convened flood prevention meetings, made flood prevention plans, and made deployments. The entire river's flood reporting network also started reporting floods half a month to a month earlier than in previous years, starting on June 1st. Currently, there are 327 hydrological stations and meteorological stations involved in flood reporting, and more will be added in the future.
    Flood prevention organizations have been established in various special districts, counties, communes, and brigades along the river in Henan and Shandong provinces; most of the flood prevention backbone teams, water situation forecasting teams, rescue teams, flood prevention material transportation teams, and gate protection teams have also been organized. The flood prevention agencies in various counties and communes in the flood detention areas have been restored, and migration plans for flood diversion have been made.
    Materials needed for flood prevention are also being actively transferred and gathered. Most of the stone materials planned to be transferred by the state have been transported to areas along the river.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 15: Continuous heavy rains in various parts of Guangdong have caused disasters, and the entire province's Party, government, army, and people are mobilizing to overcome the floods. The heavy rains in the province started on the 11th, and in the Dongjiang River basin and the Liuxi River basin, the centers of the heavy rainfall, the amount of rainfall reached more than 300 to 500 millimeters within a few days. The northern part of Guangzhou experienced the largest flood since liberation. Due to the already high water levels in various rivers, mountain ponds, and reservoirs in the previous period due to abundant rainfall, coupled with this extraordinary heavy rain, mountain floods broke out and rivers overflowed in most areas of the Foshan Special District and in some areas of Shantou, Jiangmen, and Shaoguan. As of the evening of the 14th, the county towns of Heyuan, Boluo, and Zengcheng along the Dongjiang River, the centers of the heavy rainfall, were flooded; Huiyang county town is still surrounded by floodwaters. The Dongjiang and Liuxi River basins have the most flooded cultivated land and have suffered the most severe damage. Adding in some of the affected areas of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers, according to incomplete statistics, more than 3.5 million mu of cultivated land in the province has been flooded to varying degrees. As of the evening of the 15th, the heavy rain was still continuing, and the disaster situation was still developing. The flood situation is very urgent.
    Under the command of Party committees and governments at all levels, the people of Guangdong are engaged in fierce battles with the floods. In the Foshan Special District, more than 1.2 million cadres and people have been put into the struggle for flood prevention, rescue, and drainage and harvest. In the Shantou area, a flood prevention and harvest force of more than one million people has repelled the invasion of the first flood peak as of the 14th. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a series of emergency meetings on the 14th and 15th, calling on the Party, government, army, and people of the entire province to mobilize and resolutely overcome the floods, protect production, and protect the harvest.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 15: In recent days, major rivers and streams such as the Tingjiang River, Jiulong River, Jinjiang River, and Mulan Creek in Fujian have been continuously hit by heavy rains and mountain floods. The Party, government, army, and people have formed a flood prevention and rescue force of more than 500,000 people, and after five days and nights of hard work, have achieved initial victory in flood prevention, protecting the safety of river embankments and a large number of water conservancy projects, and protecting and rescuing large areas of crops. Since the 9th, the Tingjiang, Jiulongjiang, Jinjiang, and Mulan Creek basins in western and southern Fujian have experienced continuous heavy rains, resulting in flood peaks rarely seen in many years.
    Due to the relatively good flood prevention preparations made in various places and the sound organization, the handling of water conditions, the organization of protection, and rescue efforts were all rapid and proactive. Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in various places also took the initiative to join local people and cadres in the flood prevention battle and sent cars, boats, and other equipment to help the people prevent and rescue floods. In the flood prevention and rescue efforts in various places, teams and regions supported each other. During the heavy rains and flood fighting, the people in various places tried every possible means to protect farmland and rescue various crops.

    黄河流域汛期提前
    广东福建暴雨成灾，人民奋起防洪保收
    据新华社讯　今年黄河提前半月进入汛期。8日，黄河流域普遍降雨，水位骤然上升。10日花园口站流量已达二千秒公方。据气象预报：最近几天，黄河流域还要降雨，黄河洪峰将要迭次出现。目前沿岸人民正在加紧防汛准备。
    又讯　广东各地和福建沿江地区连日暴雨成灾。广东暴雨中心的河源、博罗、增城等三个县城被洪水侵入，惠阳县城仍在洪水包围中。全省不同程度被淹的耕地达三百五十万亩以上。两省抗洪、抢险大军正同洪水展开搏斗。
    据新华社郑州15日电　近日来，黄河流域连续降雨，黄河水位上涨，提前半个多月进入汛期。沿河各地正积极组织防汛队伍，准备防汛物资。
    今年，黄河防汛准备的特别早。在5月11日到13日，黄河水利委员会和河南、山东两省就召开了防汛会议，做了防汛计划和部署。全河报汛站网也比往年提前半月到一个月，在6月1日开始报汛。现在投入报汛的水文站、气象测站有三百二十七个，今后还要增加。
    河南和山东两省沿河各专、县、公社、大队的防汛组织都已建立；防汛基干队、水情预报队、救护队、防汛器材运输队、护闸队绝大部分也已组织起来。滞黄区各县、公社的防汛机构都已恢复，并做了分滞洪水的迁移规划。
      防汛需要的物资也正在积极调运、聚集中。国家计划调运的石料，大部分已运到沿河地区。
    据新华社广州15日电　广东各地连日大雨成灾，全省党政军民正动员起来，战胜洪水。全省大雨从11日开始，暴雨中心的东江流域和流溪河流域，几天之内降雨量即达三百至五百公厘以上。广州市北部地区暴发了解放以来最大的洪水。全省由于前一时期雨水已经很多，各江河和山塘水库的水位已经很高，加上此次特大暴雨，因而佛山专区大部分地区和汕头、江门、韶关的少部分地区山洪暴发，江河泛滥。到14日晚止，暴雨中心的东江沿岸河源、博罗、增城等三个县城被洪水侵入；惠阳县城仍在洪水包围中。东江、流溪河流域被淹耕地最多，受灾较重，加上西江和北江的部分受害地区，据不完全统计，全省不同程度被淹耕地达三百五十万亩以上。到15日晚上止，大雨还在继续，灾情还在发展。汛情十分紧急。
    广东省各地人民在各级党委和政府的指挥下，同洪水展开激烈搏斗。佛山专区投入防洪抢险和排涝抢收斗争的干部群众达一百二十多万人，汕头地区一百多万防洪、抢收大军，到14日止已击退了第一次洪峰的侵袭。中共广东省委在14日、15日召开了一系列紧急会议，号召全省党政军民动员起来，全力战胜洪水，保卫生产，保卫丰收。
    据新华社福州15日电　连日来福建汀江、九龙江、晋江和木兰溪等主要江河溪流连续受到暴雨和山洪的袭击。党、政、军、民组成五十多万抗洪、抢险大军，经过五天的日夜奋战，获得抗洪初步胜利，保护了江海河堤和大量水利工程的安全，保护和抢救了大片农作物。9日起，闽西和闽南的汀江、九龙江、晋江和木兰溪流域一带地区，连续暴雨，出现多年少见的洪峰。
    各地由于防汛防洪准备工作作的较好，组织健全，在掌握水情、组织防护和抢救等方面都很迅速主动。驻各地人民解放军官兵也都主动和当地群众、干部一起投入防洪战斗，并派出汽车、船只等帮助群众防洪抢险。各地在防洪抢险中，队与队、地区之间都互相支援。各地群众在暴雨和抗洪斗争中，千方百计保护农田，抢救各种农作物。
