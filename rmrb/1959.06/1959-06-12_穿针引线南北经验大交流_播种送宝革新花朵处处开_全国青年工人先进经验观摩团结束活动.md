Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 11th: The National Youth Worker Advanced Experience Observation Group concluded its activities in Wuhan on the 9th. The advanced youth workers participating in the observation group have successively returned to their production posts.

Since the observation group began its activities in Beijing on April 1st, it has visited forty-one large and medium-sized cities in the north and south in seventy days. The members went deep into 477 factories and construction sites and exchanged advanced experiences in metallurgy, machinery, electric power, construction, textile, and other industries with more than 239,300 young workers, and were warmly welcomed. The young workers praised the observation group as a "treasure-delivering team," a "promotion team," and a "seed-sowing team."

The activities of the observation group received attention and care from the local Party committees, administrations, and trade union organizations. Whenever they arrived in a province or city, the local Party committee gave instructions for their activities. In factories and construction sites, the Party secretary and factory director personally presided over the performance and discussion activities.

The activities of the observation group were closely centered on the campaign to increase production and practice economy, combining the promotion of advanced experiences with the activities of the broad masses of workers to overcome key production problems, effectively promoting current production. According to statistics from the three cities of Lanzhou, Changchun, and Harbin, the members of the observation group, together with the local workers, solved a total of 174 key production problems. Of the 5,729 rationalization proposals put forward by the observation group members in various places, 26% have already been realized by local workers. After the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's open-hearth furnace workshop promoted the experience taught by Hao Jinfang, the furnace chief of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Youth Friendship Furnace, the sulfur content of steel generally decreased, and the smelting time was greatly shortened. Steel rolling worker Pu Yaozu helped various places install and adjust ten forward and reverse retaining discs and finished product retaining discs, which not only improved the output and quality of steel, but also greatly reduced the labor intensity of workers. Young mechanical workers, who are currently attacking the quality of castings, especially welcomed the experience of high-quality and high-yield cast iron and cast steel introduced by Wang Dewen and Wang Fengming. After the Hangzhou Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Hangzhou Machine Tool Plant promoted the experience spread by Wang Dewen, the scrap rate of castings decreased by 7% and 10% respectively. Observation group members Liao Shigang, Li Yumin, Peng Dasheng, Wang Ziwu, Tang Yuankang, Lu Shenghe, and Lü Shucheng, etc., according to the specific conditions of each machine factory, helped workers improve the vulnerable parts of the tools and speed up the machine tool, which generally improved the processing efficiency of the machine tool. The spread of other experiences, such as the improvement of tools in the construction industry, the multi-delivery and safe power supply in the power industry, and the advanced spinning and weaving methods in the textile industry, has also played a significant role in production in various places.

The process of the observation group spreading advanced technology is also a process of spreading advanced thinking. Wherever they went, they held large meetings, talked about the situation, talked about the Party's requirements for young people, and talked about the advanced deeds of advanced people. A total of 185,800 young people in forty-one cities participated in such conferences and broadcast conferences. When the members of the observation group arrived in workshops and construction sites, they actively thought of ways to make suggestions and help solve problems, no matter how big or small, which deeply moved the young people. Young workers at the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory said: "The members of the observation group put forward big and small suggestions, and did not let go of any way to increase production and practice economy. This spirit is worth learning from us." Some young workers in Beijing originally thought that their technical level was low and they could not innovate technology. After seeing Liao Shigang come to the factory to innovate technology and knowing that he was also a fourth-grade worker, they criticized the idea that "low-level workers cannot innovate" and greatly increased their enthusiasm for innovating technology. Young workers in the batch, heavy, and forging workshops of the First Machine Tool Plant put forward 481 innovation suggestions in twelve days.

In the process of spreading experience, the members of the observation group also learned from the young workers in various places. In two months, they learned a total of 988 advanced experiences from various places and promptly spread these experiences to other regions.

At present, although the activities of the observation group have ended, young workers in various places, under the organization of the Communist Youth League, continue to carry out local advanced experience exchange activities, spread the experiences of the observation group members, and make these advanced experiences more widely promoted.

    穿针引线南北经验大交流  播种送宝革新花朵处处开
    全国青年工人先进经验观摩团结束活动
    新华社武汉11日电　全国青年工人先进经验观摩团9日已在武汉结束活动。参加观摩团的先进青年工人已经陆续返回生产岗位。
    观摩团从4月1日在北京开始活动以来，七十天内共访问了南北四十一个大中城市。团员们先后深入到四百七十七个工厂和工地，同二十三万九千三百多名青年工人交流了冶金、机械、电力、建筑、纺织等行业的先进经验，受到热烈欢迎。青年工人们赞扬观摩团是“送宝队”“促进队”“播种队”。
    观摩团的活动受到各地党委、行政和工会组织的重视和关怀。他们每到一个省市，当地党委都对他们的活动给以指示。在工厂工地，都由党委书记、厂长亲自主持表演和座谈活动。
    观摩团的活动紧密围绕着增产节约运动进行，使推广的先进经验和广大职工攻打生产关键的活动结合起来，有力地促进了当前生产。据兰州、长春、哈尔滨三个城市统计，观摩团团员同当地职工一起，先后共解决了一百七十四个生产中带关键性的问题。观摩团团员在各地提出的五千七百二十九条合理化建议，有26％已经由当地工人实现。太原钢铁公司和重庆钢铁公司大平炉车间推广鞍钢青年友谊炉炉长郝金芳传授的经验以后，钢的含硫量普遍降低，冶炼时间大大缩短。轧钢工人浦耀祖帮助各地安装和调整了十个正反围盘和成品围盘，不仅使钢材的产量质量提高，而且使工人的劳动强度大大减轻。正在猛攻铸件质量关的青年机械工人，特别欢迎王德文、王凤鸣介绍的铸铁铸钢优质高产经验。杭州汽车制造厂、杭州机床厂推广王德文传播的经验后，铸件废品率分别下降7％和10％。观摩团团员廖世刚、李裕民、彭大生、王子文、唐远康、卢盛和、吕书城等，根据各机械厂的具体情况，帮助工人改进薄弱环节的刀具，加快机床转速，使机床加工效率普遍提高。其他像建筑业改进工具、电力工业的多送电和安全供电、纺织工业的先进纺纱织布方法等经验的传播，也都对各地的生产起了很大作用。
    观摩团传播先进技术的过程也是传播先进思想的过程。他们每到一地，都开大会，讲形势，讲党对青年的要求，讲先进人物先进事迹。四十一个城市参加这种大会和广播大会的青年共有十八万五千八百多人。观摩团团员到了车间、工地，对生产中的问题，不问大小，都积极想办法提建议，帮助解决，这种主人翁态度使青年们深为感动。上海柴油机厂青年工人说：“观摩团团员提出大大小小建议，不放过点点滴滴增产节约门路，这种精神值得我们学习。”北京有些青年工人原来认为自己技术水平低，没法革新技术，看到了廖世刚来厂革新技术并且知道他也是四级工以后，批判了“低级工不能革新”的思想，大大提高了革新技术的劲头。第一机床厂成批、重型、锻工三个车间的青年工人，就在十二天里提出了四百八十一项革新建议。
    观摩团团员在传播经验中也向各地青年工人学习。两个月内，他们共学习各地先进经验九百八十八项，并且穿针引线，及时将这些经验传播到其他地区。
    目前，观摩团活动虽已结束，但各地青年工人在共青团的组织下，继续开展当地的先进经验交流活动，传播观摩团团员的经验，使这些先进经验更加广泛地推广开来。
