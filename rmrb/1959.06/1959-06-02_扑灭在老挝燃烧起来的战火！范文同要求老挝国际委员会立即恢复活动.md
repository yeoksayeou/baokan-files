Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st: Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a telegram today to Tarasingh Bal, Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, regarding the situation in Laos, requesting the International Commission for Laos to resume its activities immediately.

Pham Van Dong pointed out in the telegram that in order to weaken and quickly extinguish the flames of war that are burning in Laos and threatening peace in Indochina, it is extremely urgent and necessary for the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos to resume its activities immediately.

The telegram said that since May 1st, the situation in Laos has become increasingly serious. The Royal Lao Army, under the command of Phoui Sananikone, has begun a large-scale offensive against the Second Battalion of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units. Fierce battles are taking place in Xieng Khouang, near the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Especially on May 28th, 29th, and at the time I am writing this letter, the aforementioned flames of war have developed even more intensely.

Pham Van Dong pointed out in the telegram that the Phoui Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the dangerous situation they have created under the instigation of foreign countries.

Pham Van Dong requested the Chairman of the International Commission for Laos to make a swift decision on the issue of the International Commission for Laos resuming its activities. He pointed out: "Delayed measures will make the situation even more serious."

    扑灭在老挝燃烧起来的战火！
    范文同要求老挝国际委员会立即恢复活动
    新华社河内1日电　越南民主共和国外交部部长范文同今天就老挝局势打电报给老挝国际监察和监督委员会主席塔拉辛格·巴尔，要求老挝国际委员会立即恢复活动。
    范文同在电报里指出，为了削弱并迅速扑灭正在老挝燃烧起来、威胁印度支那和平的战火，老挝国际监察和监督委员会的立即恢复活动，是极其迫切和必要的。
    电报说，从5月1日以来，老挝的局势日益严重。老挝王国军队奉培·萨纳尼空的命令，已经开始大规模地进攻前寮国战斗部队的第二营。激烈的交战正在川圹的靠近越南民主共和国边界的地方进行着。尤其是在5月28、29日和在我写这封信的时候，上述战火发展得更加激烈。
    范文同在电报里指出，培·萨纳尼空政府对他们在外国嗾使下所造成的危险局势必须负全部责任。
    范文同要求老挝国际委员会主席就老挝国际委员会恢复活动的问题迅速作出决定。他指出：“迟缓的措施将使局势变得更为严重。”
