Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 25th: A Bulgarian Party and Government delegation, headed by Todor Zhivkov, the First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and member of the Presidium of the National Assembly of Bulgaria, arrived in Warsaw at 12:00 noon today for a friendly visit at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government.

Leaders of the Polish Party and government, including Władysław Gomułka, Józef Cyrankiewicz, Aleksander Zawadzki, and others, were at the airport to welcome the delegation. Also present to welcome them were Polish social activists, generals, diplomatic envoys, and thousands of citizens of Warsaw.

Gomułka delivered a welcoming speech at the airport, extending a warm welcome to the guests. He said that the visit of the Bulgarian delegation to Poland would make a new contribution to the rapprochement between the peoples of Poland and Bulgaria.

In his reply, Zhivkov said that the purpose of the visit was to show the friendship and solidarity between the two peoples, to demonstrate their common desire to defend the interests of peace, and to demonstrate the unity of the socialist camp.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 25th: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Władysław Gomułka, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, Józef Cyrankiewicz, hosted a grand banquet tonight in honor of the Bulgarian Party and Government delegation headed by Todor Zhivkov.

Gomułka said at the banquet that Poland values the contribution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to consolidating peace in the Balkans and supports the plan for the Balkans to become a zone free of atomic weapons and rocket bases, and supports the efforts of the Bulgarian government and other governments in this regard.

Gomułka said that the Polish people, along with all peace-loving people, are extremely concerned about eliminating the roots of threats to peace, especially the German question, which is currently extremely important for European security. Our firm policy of peace is: to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, to eliminate the occupation regime in West Berlin, and to solve the West Berlin problem.

Zhivkov said at the banquet that today peace is not only the cause of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist camp, but also the cause of all peace-loving people. Therefore, the people of the world welcomed the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference with great interest and hope, but the progress of the conference was not smooth. The blame and responsibility for this lies first with the United States, Britain, and France, and the aggressive forces of these countries, and with the West German revanchist group headed by Adenauer, who want to follow Hitler's path. If the Geneva Conference resumes and fails to reach a consensus on eliminating the occupation regime in West Berlin and fails to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, then they will bear the responsibility. Zhivkov concluded by saying that the noble cause of world peace will ultimately be victorious.

    保加利亚党政代表团抵华沙
    波兰党政领导人设宴招待保加利亚贵宾
    新华社华沙25日电　以保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记、保加利亚国民议会主席团委员日夫科夫为首的保加利亚党政代表团应波兰统一工人党中央委员会和波兰政府的邀请，在今天十二时抵达华沙作友好访问。
    到机场欢迎代表团的有波兰党和政府的领导人哥穆尔卡、西伦凯维兹、萨瓦茨基等，前往欢迎的还有波兰的社会活动家、将军、外交使节和华沙的数千市民。
    哥穆尔卡在机场上致欢迎词，对客人表示热烈欢迎。他说，保加利亚代表团到波兰访问将为波兰和保加利亚两国人民的接近作出新的贡献。
    日夫科夫在致答词中说，这次访问的目的是显示两国人民的友谊和团结，展示两国人民渴望保卫和平利益的共同愿望，展示社会主义阵营的团结一致。
    新华社华沙25日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡、波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹今晚举行盛大宴会，招待以日夫科夫为首的保加利亚党政代表团。
    哥穆尔卡在宴会上讲话说，波兰重视保加利亚人民共和国对巩固巴尔干的和平所作的贡献，支持巴尔干成为无原子武器和无火箭基地的计划，支持保加利亚政府和其他政府在这一方面的努力。
    哥穆尔卡说，波兰人民和一切爱好和平的人民一道，极其关心消除威胁和平的根源，特别是关心目前对欧洲安全极其重要的德国问题。我们坚定的和平政策是：与德国缔结和约，消除西柏林占领制度，解决西柏林问题。
    日夫科夫在宴会上讲话说，今天和平不仅是社会主义阵营共产党和工人党的事业，而且也是一切爱好和平的人民的事业，因此全世界人民曾以很大的兴趣和希望迎接了日内瓦外长会议，但会议的进展并不顺利，其罪过和责任首先由美英法和这些国家的侵略力量来承担，由以阿登纳为首的想走希特勒道路的西德复仇主义集团来承担。如果日内瓦会议复会以后，在消除西柏林占领制度问题上不能获得一致的意见，不能缔结对德和约，那么责任还将由他们承担。日夫科夫最后说，世界和平的高尚事业最终定会得到胜利。
