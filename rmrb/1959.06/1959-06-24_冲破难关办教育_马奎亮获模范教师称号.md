Overcoming Difficulties to Run Education
Ma Kuiliang Awarded Model Teacher Title

(Our dispatch) Ma Kuiliang, a teacher at Xinzhuangji People's Commune Elementary School in Tongxin County, Ningxia, has been awarded the honorary title of "Model Teacher" by the County People's Committee for his achievements in running the school.

Ma Kuiliang, a Hui youth and member of the Communist Youth League, graduated from Beijing No. 14 Middle School and, following the organization's assignment, came to Ningxia to support its construction. In September of last year, he arrived at Nanguankou Junior Elementary School in Xinzhuangji Commune, Tongxin County, to serve as a teacher. When he first arrived, there were no classrooms or offices. Relying on the leadership of the local Party organization and the strength of the masses, he finally got the school up and running.

Due to the impression left by the Ma bandits' rule in Ningxia in the past, where people "hired others to study," the masses were unwilling to let their children, especially girls, attend school, despite his vigorous propaganda and mobilization. At the beginning of the semester, there were only eight students. In order to dispel the masses' ideological concerns and encourage children to go to school, he often climbed mountains and crossed gullies, visiting villages and even individual households. After repeated propaganda, the number of students has now increased from the original eight to fifty-six, with seventeen being female students.

With more students, classrooms became a problem again. Ma Kuiliang led the students in cleaning up a dirty donkey cave and opened a beautiful classroom. The students happily attended classes here. Thanks to Ma Kuiliang's patient education, the students achieved excellent results, with a total average score of over four points in last year's term exams.

In order to solve the students' difficulties with textbooks, paper, pens, and ink, as well as teaching and office expenses, Ma Kuiliang also came up with many ways to engage in work-study programs. He used his spare time before and after class every day to take students to the mountains to pick hair-like seaweed. By the time school started on March 1st, they had picked three jin and four liang, selling it for seven yuan, three jiao, and four fen. This not only solved part of the office expenses but also bought each person a pencil and a notebook.

To encourage him to continue to do a good job in the Party's education work, the Tongxin County People's Committee recently awarded Ma Kuiliang the honorary title of Model Teacher and granted him a material reward. The Tongxin County Committee of the Communist Youth League also officially approved his participation in the Communist Youth League.

### 冲破难关办教育  马奎亮获模范教师称号

    冲破难关办教育
    马奎亮获模范教师称号
    本报讯　宁夏同心县新庄集人民公社小学教员马奎亮，因办学有成绩，受到了县人民委员会给予的“模范教师”光荣称号。
    共青团员马奎亮是回族青年，从北京第十四中学毕业后，服从组织分配到宁夏支援建设。去年9月间，来到同心县新庄集公社南关口初小担任教师。他刚到这里的时候，教室、办公室都没有，依靠当地党组织的领导和群众的力量，终于把学校办起来了。
    由于过去马匪统治宁夏时，给这里的人们留下了“雇人念书”的印象，虽然他大力宣传动员，群众还是不愿让自己的孩子特别是女孩子到学校念书。开学的时候，只有八个学生。为了解除群众的思想顾虑，让孩子上学念书，他经常翻山越沟，深入各庄子以至各家各户进行访问。经过反复宣传，目前学生已由原来的八人跃增到五十六人，有十七人是女学生。
    学生多了教室又成了问题。马奎亮又带上学生收拾了一孔肮脏的驴窑，开辟了一间漂亮的教室。同学们愉快地在这里听课。由于马奎亮耐心教育，学生成绩很好，去年学期期考成绩总平均分数都在四分以上。
    为了解决学生的书本、纸张、笔墨和教学办公费用的困难问题，马奎亮在勤工俭学方面也想了不少办法。他每天利用上课前和放学后的课余时间，带学生上山拾发菜。到3月1日开学的时候，拾了三斤四两，卖了七元三角四分。这样，不但解决了部分办公费用，还给每人买了一根铅笔，一个笔记本。
    为了鼓励他继续作好党的教育工作，最近同心县人民委员会给予马奎亮以模范教师的光荣称号，并授予物质奖励。共青团同心县委也正式批准他参加了共产主义青年团。
