    The resolution passed by the Delhi meeting said, "The United States and its troops should immediately cease all actions that violate the Korean Armistice Agreement, dismantle their military facilities and bases in South Korea, and end their aggressive military adventure policy and interference in South Korean affairs." It said, "The Korean issue should be resolved according to the free will of the entire Korean people."

    Chandra, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, who presided over the meeting, said in his speech that the resolution represented the opinion of the entire Indian people.

    Dehkin Lun, Chairman of the Burmese Trade Union Congress, said at the meeting that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has consistently adhered to the Armistice Agreement and has put forward many important proposals for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. Conversely, the South Korean puppet government has continuously violated the Armistice Agreement, endangering not only peace in Korea but also peace in Asia.
