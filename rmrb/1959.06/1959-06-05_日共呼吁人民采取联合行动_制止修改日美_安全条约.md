Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 3rd: The Japanese Communist Party today distributed millions of leaflets calling on people from all walks of life to take immediate action to stop the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and abolish this treaty.

The Communist Party said in the leaflet that the situation has reached a critical stage, and delaying the launch of a large-scale movement against the "Security Treaty" will bring serious consequences to the Japanese people. The leaflet mentioned Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama's remarks a few days ago that the Japanese government believes that "an attack on U.S. forces stationed in Japan is an attack on Japan" and that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will not include provisions prohibiting the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan. The Communist Party also asked people to pay attention to the fact that the Japanese "Defense Agency" has already stated its intention to arm the Japanese army with nuclear weapons.

The appeal stated that as the first step in defending world peace and striving for Japan's independence and neutrality, it is very necessary for the Japanese people to force the Nobusuke Kishi government to abandon its plan to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The Japanese Communist Party demanded that the Socialist Party, trade unions, farmers' associations, and other groups from all walks of life, as well as peace-loving people, immediately launch a joint movement against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and strive to enlighten the public on this issue.

The Communist Party also called on them to hold mass meetings in villages and workshops, demand that local councils pass resolutions opposing the government's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and begin to establish joint struggle organizations at all levels.

    日共呼吁人民采取联合行动
    制止修改日美“安全条约”
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本共产党今天散发了千千万万的传单，呼吁各界人民立即采取行动来制止修改日美“安全条约”和取消这个条约。
    共产党在传单中说，情况已经达到严重的阶段，拖延发动大规模的运动来反对“安全条约”将给日本人民带来严重的后果。传单谈到外务相藤山爱一郎前几天发表的关于日本政府认为“对驻日美军的进攻就是对日本的进攻”以及新的日美“安全条约”将不包括禁止把核武器运入日本的条款的谈话。共产党还要求人们注意这个事实：日本
  “防卫厅”已经表明了它打算用核武器武装日本军队的意图。
    呼吁书说，作为保卫世界和平和争取日本的独立和中立的第一个步骤，日本人民非常有必要迫使岸信介政府放弃修改日美“安全条约”的计划。
    日本共产党要求社会党、工会、农民协会和其他各界团体以及爱好和平的人士立即发动联合的运动来反对日美“安全条约”，并且努力在这个问题上启发公众。
    共产党还呼吁他们在乡村和车间举行群众大会，要求地方议会通过反对政府改修日美“安全条约”的决议，并且着手建立各级联合斗争组织。
