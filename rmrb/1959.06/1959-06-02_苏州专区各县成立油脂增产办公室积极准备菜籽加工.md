Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 1st: The 600,000 mu of rapeseed in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are being harvested. As of May 25th, the grain departments throughout the prefecture had purchased more than 420,000 jin of rapeseed.

This year, Suzhou Prefecture's rapeseed has had a bumper harvest. The rapeseed that has already been harvested is mostly full-grained and of good quality. After threshing the rapeseed, the communes are immediately selling it to the state, using the income from sales for the current summer harvest and planting.

In order to achieve rapid harvesting, threshing, purchasing, and transportation, and to strive to complete the rapeseed unified purchase task smoothly within June, the grain departments at all levels in Suzhou Prefecture, in addition to actively setting up purchasing points, cleaning warehouses, preparing equipment, and allocating personnel, have also taken the following measures: First, they are organizing personnel to go to the communes and production teams to understand and verify production, publicize purchasing policies, help production teams arrange labor and tools, and organize transportation to warehouses. Second, according to the sales tasks assigned by the county and commune, they are signing "five fix" (fixed time, fixed point, fixed quantity, fixed quality, and fixed tools) contracts with production teams in order to organize rapeseed into warehouses in a planned manner. Third, they are establishing democratic price negotiation organizations and promoting democratic price negotiation methods. Currently, most of the purchasing points in Kunshan and Wujiang counties have established democratic price negotiation organizations. Fourth, they are arranging for rapeseed processing. At present, all counties have established oil crop increase offices. Changshu, Wujiang and other counties have held meetings of oil factory directors to make specific arrangements, requiring that after the rapeseed is stored, it should be pressed and transferred immediately to supply other areas.

    苏州专区各县成立油脂增产办公室积极准备菜籽加工
    据新华社南京1日电　江苏省苏州专区六十万亩油菜正在收割。到5月25日止，全区粮食部门已收购到菜籽四十二万多斤。
    今年苏州专区的油菜获得大丰收，已收的菜籽大都子粒饱满，质量很好。各公社在油菜脱粒后，都立即将菜籽卖给国家，把收入的现金用于当前夏收夏种。
    苏州专区各级粮食部门为了做到快收、快打、快收购、快调运，争取在6月份内顺利完成菜籽统购任务，除了积极地设置收购点、清理仓库、准备用具、调配人员以外，又采取了以下措施：一、组织人员到公社和生产队了解和核实产量，宣传收购政策，帮助生产队安排劳力和工具，组织运送入库。二、根据县、社分配的交售任务，同生产队签订“五定”（定时、定点、定量、定质、定工具）合同，以便有计划地组织菜籽入库。三、建立民主议价组织，推广民主议价办法。现在昆山、吴江两县的大部分收购点已成立民主议价组织。四、安排菜籽加工。目前各县都已成立了油脂增产办公室，常熟、吴江等县召开了油厂厂长会议，具体作了布置，要求在入库以后，作到随榨、随调拨，供应外地。
