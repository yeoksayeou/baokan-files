    The "Hua Wei Du" (Flower Tail Ferry) "Shuguang" (Dawn) No. 203, departing from Guangzhou, was heading straight for Zhaoqing, Gaoyao County, towed by a steamboat at full speed, braving the floodwaters.
    As the ferry entered the dangerous waterway "White Snake Turn," the duty officer, with his sharp eyes, spotted a dangerous situation far ahead—the water was swirling extremely rapidly, and the waves were churning violently. He immediately judged: "Not good! A breach!" This was the Xilong levee, and it had been breached by the ferocious flood, creating a gap about seven zhang (approximately 23 meters) wide. The peasant brothers were fighting tenaciously against the flood.
    The captain of the Shuguang, Deng Niu, and the vice-captains, Zhang Huodai and Ye Nuan, after a brief discussion, decided that in order to protect the peasant brothers' fields and to ensure the safety of navigation, and to prevent the ship from being swept into the breach by the flood, they immediately ordered the ship to stop and mobilized the crew to support the peasant brothers in plugging the breach.
    As soon as this decision was announced, the passengers unexpectedly became excited. Everyone shouted, "We'll go too!" "We want to sign up for the rescue!" Zhen Zhi, the deputy political commissar of the Guangsi County Conscription Bureau, representing the will of all the passengers on board, requested the captain to assign them tasks.
    Zhen Zhi and others quickly organized the passengers on the ship. Just an hour earlier, the passengers here each had their own concerns, but at this moment, under the leadership of the Communist Party members, they immediately became an excellent fighting force. Among them were People's Liberation Army soldiers, workers, old men, women, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau. An old man over half a century old also wanted to join the rescue effort. Zhen Zhi and others politely dissuaded him, but the old man said, "Rescuing the dyke! How can I not do my part! I'm familiar with the water, I'm not afraid!"
    The team, composed of more than seventy passengers and more than ten crew members, rushed to the dangerous section. Zhen Zhi became the political commissar of this team. Their arrival gave the peasant brothers on the levee tremendous encouragement. "The reinforcements are here!" Cheers rang out on the dangerous section.
    Wu Jin, the chairman of the ship's trade union, was the leader of the temporary rescue team. After looking at the breach, he felt that it was not a good idea for people to throw sandbags randomly. It was necessary to place the sandbags around the fir pilings in a planned way to build a "Great Wall" that was exposed above the water. He held a sandbag weighing hundreds of pounds, said "Come on!" and jumped into the water. After several attempts, he managed to place the sandbag. Following him, the others who were rescuing the dyke also jumped down like warriors descending from the sky, "plop, plop." Some were washed far away by the flood, and some encountered large chunks of silt underwater, but they didn't care. The underwater "Great Wall" was built inch by inch.
    The vice-captains Ye Nuan and Zhang Huodai were responsible for the transportation team. They sailed upstream from hundreds of meters away to transport large quantities of sandbags. The upstream current was so fierce that it sometimes forced the ship to not move an inch, so they jumped into the water to push the ship. As soon as the sandbags were transported to the shore, everyone, not knowing where the strength came from, picked up large sandbags and ran.
    This team, composed of crew members and passengers, fought hard from 4 p.m. on the 17th until about 11 p.m. As the breach was about to be closed, the chief person in charge of repairing the dangerous section of the levee repeatedly advised them to return to the ship to rest. Only then did they reluctantly return to the ship.
    The ship continued to sail. That night, the lights on the ship seemed particularly bright. The crew members and passengers held a celebration party on the way, celebrating their common victory against the flood.

    旅途抢险
    从广州开出的“花尾渡”曙光二零三号，在汽轮开足马力的拖带下，正冒着洪水，直奔高要县肇庆。
    当渡船驶入危险水道“白蛇转”的时候，值班员以他的锐利眼睛，老远就望见前面出现险象——水势回旋特急，波浪翻滚得厉害。他立刻判断出：“不好！决堤啦！”这是西龙围，它已被凶恶的洪水冲开一个宽达七丈左右的决口。农民兄弟们正在顽强地同洪水搏斗。
    曙光号船长邓牛，副船长张伙带、叶暖，经过短促的研究，为了保护农民兄弟的田园，为了航行的安全，不让船只给洪水卷进决口，立刻下令停航，动员船员支援农民兄弟抢堵决口去。
    这个决定一宣布，意想不到旅客们也都沸腾起来了。大家嚷着：“我们也去！”“我们要报名抢险！”广四县兵役局副政治委员震志等，代表了全船乘客的意志，向船长请求派给任务。
    震志等很快就将船上的旅客组织起来。一个小时以前，这里的旅客们还是各有各的心事，但此刻他们在共产党员们的领导下，立刻成为一支出色的战斗队伍。在他们当中，有解放军战士、工人、老大爷、妇女和港澳同胞。一位年过半百的老大爷也要投入抢险斗争，震志等婉词劝阻，他老人家却说：“抢险！怎能没有我一分！我熟水，不怕！”
    七十多位旅客和十多位船员组成的队伍，火速开到险段上来了。震志无形中成为这支队伍的政治委员了。他们的到来，给堤上农民兄弟莫大的鼓舞。“生力军来啦！”险段上响起了一片欢呼声。
    船上工会主席吴金，是临时抢险组的组长。他到决口看了一下之后，觉得人们乱抛沙袋不是办法，必须有计划地把沙袋放在杉桩周围，砌出一道露出水面的“长城”才行。他抱着成百斤的沙袋，说声“来呀！”便纵身跳进水里，几经努力，才把沙袋摆好，跟着，其他抢险的人们也都像从天而降的勇士，“扑通”“扑通”的跳下去。他们有的被洪水冲到老远，有的在水下碰到大块淤泥，可是都毫不在乎。水下“长城”一寸一寸地砌起来了。
    担任运送组长的是副船长叶暖、张伙带。他们乘船从几百公尺以外的地方逆流而上，运来大批沙袋。逆流是那么凶恶，有时迫使船只寸步难移，于是他们便跳下水中推船。沙袋一运到岸边，不知哪里来的力气，每个人背起大大的沙袋就飞跑。
    这支由船员和旅客共同组成的队伍，17日从下午四时一直苦战到夜晚十一时许。眼看决口快合龙了，抢修堤围险段的总负责人一再劝他们回船休息，这时他们才勉强回到船上。
    船继续开行了。这天晚上，船上灯火似乎特别明亮，船员们和旅客们在途中开了一个祝捷晚会，庆祝他们共同抗洪的胜利。
