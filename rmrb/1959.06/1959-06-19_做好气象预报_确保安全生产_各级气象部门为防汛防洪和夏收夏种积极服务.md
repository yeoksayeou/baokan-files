Since the summer, weather disasters have occurred one after another. Following the spring drought, the drought situation in southern Northeast China, northern North China, and most of Northwest China has not been alleviated. Meanwhile, the flood season has already begun in the Jiangnan region and coastal provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the typhoon season is approaching. These weather disasters are threatening the safe production of water conservancy construction, as well as the fishing, salt, and transportation industries, especially this year's bumper harvest of summer agriculture.

In order to guarantee a bumper harvest in summer agriculture and the safe operation of various productions, meteorological departments at all levels have made a series of preparations to improve the quality and timeliness of weather forecasts, especially to provide good disaster weather forecast services.

As early as late April, the Central Meteorological Bureau issued a notice to meteorological departments in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, requiring all localities to strengthen this year's flood prevention meteorological forecasting work. Meteorological departments in various places, such as the Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hebei, and Henan Provincial Meteorological Bureaus, have also quickly arranged their work in accordance with the instructions of the provincial party committees, provincial people's committees, and the Central Meteorological Bureau. The Central Meteorological Science Research Institute convened a discussion meeting in Beijing on long-term precipitation forecasting for the second half of the year for eight provinces and one municipality, studied the long-term precipitation forecast for the country from May to September this year, and began broadcasting daily national precipitation forecasts from mid-May to guide the precipitation forecasting work of meteorological units in various places. The Zhejiang Provincial Meteorological Bureau held a typhoon and rainstorm forecasting research meeting. Meteorological units at all levels have also arranged to do a good job in weather forecasting services for summer harvesting and planting. Now, meteorological departments at all levels across the country are focusing on coordinating flood control, flood prevention, summer harvesting, and planting, setting off a wave of doing a good job in meteorological forecasting services, and some areas have already begun to make some achievements.

On May 4, the Shanghai area experienced thunderstorms and heavy rain, with a total rainfall of 53.6 mm. The Shanghai Municipal Meteorological Observatory accurately predicted this thunderstorm and heavy rain. The Municipal Flood Control Headquarters convened an emergency telephone conference in advance, made mobilizations and deployments, and the counties and people's communes in the suburbs, as well as factories, institutions, and enterprises in the urban area, convened telephone conferences or broadcast conferences to make emergency mobilizations to commune members and cadres. The city organized an army of 200,000 people, took emergency preventive measures, and engaged in battle, winning a victory with relatively full preparation. On May 2, the Luoyan People's Commune in Luodian County, Guizhou Province, received a forecast from the county meteorological station that there would be thunderstorms and hail within 4 to 7 days. In order to ensure that the summer harvest crops returned to the barn, the commune party committee immediately made an emergency mobilization to all commune members and cadres, organized a rush harvesting army of more than 6,300 people, worked hard early and late, fought fiercely for three days, and rushed to harvest 2,801 mu of already ripe wheat. On the evening of May 4, when a strong wind arrived, followed by thunderstorms and hail, the commune members were joyfully holding a meeting to summarize the experience of this battle and study the next production plan. Since April, varying degrees of drought have appeared in various parts of Sichuan Province. On May 3, the Chengdu Central Meteorological Observatory and the district meteorological observatory consulted on the weather and predicted that there would be rainstorms. The meteorological observatories of each prefecture issued warnings of strong winds, heavy rain, and rainstorms on the 4th and 5th, and proposed important measures to rush water storage and harvest mature spring crops. The meteorological (observation) stations in various places made more specific forecasts and measures according to local conditions, and immediately reported to party committees at all levels. The party committees at all levels attached great importance to this and immediately convened emergency telephone conferences, requiring leaders at all levels to take the lead and mobilize the broad masses to participate in rushing water storage and water conservation, as well as rushing to plant.

Now, meteorological departments at all levels are stepping up precautions, intensifying the study and technical summary of relevant preparations for making summer disaster weather forecasts; inspecting the meteorological service organization work of meteorological units at all levels for flood prevention and summer harvesting and planting, strengthening the information contact and collaboration between stations, stations, and outposts; understanding the new requirements of various production departments in terms of meteorology; and calling on all meteorological stations, stations, and outpost groups to extensively carry out supplementary forecasting and agricultural meteorological forecasting, and give play to the active role of meteorological units at all levels in doing a good job in meteorological services for flood prevention, summer harvesting, and planting.

    做好气象预报　确保安全生产
    各级气象部门为防汛防洪和夏收夏种积极服务
    本报讯　夏季天气灾害已经相继出现。继春旱以后，东北南部、华北北部、西北大部分地区，旱象还没有解除，而江南地区和沿海江苏、浙江等省汛期已经开始，台风季节就要到来。这些天气灾害正威胁着水利建设以及渔业、盐业、交通运输业等的安全生产，特别是今年夏季农业的丰产丰收。
    为了保证夏季农业的大丰收和各项生产的安全进行，各级气象部门对于提高天气预报质量和时效，特别是做好灾害性天气预报服务，已经进行了一系列的准备工作。
    中央气象局早在4月下旬已经向各省、市、自治区气象部门发出了通知，要求各地加强今年的防汛气象预报工作。各地气象部门如广东、浙江、江苏、湖南、河北、河南等省气象局，也都根据省委、省人民委员会和中央气象局的指示，迅速布置了工作。中央气象科学研究所曾经在北京召开了八省一市下半年降水长期预报讨论会，研究了今年5到9月全国降水长期预报，并从5月中旬开始每日增发全国降水量预报广播，以指导各地气象单位的降水预报工作。浙江省气象局召开了台风暴雨预报研究会。各级气象单位也都安排了做好夏收夏种的天气预报服务工作。现在全国各级气象部门正以配合防汛防洪和夏收夏种为中心，掀起一个做好气象预报服务的热潮，而且有些地区已经开始作出一些成绩。
    上海地区5月4日出现了雷暴雨，总降雨量达五十三点六毫米，上海市的气象台对这次雷暴雨的预报很准确。市防汛总指挥部事先召开了紧急电话会议，做了动员和部署，郊区各县、各人民公社和市区各工厂、机关、企业都召开了电话会议或者广播会议，向社员和干部作了紧急动员，全市组织了二十万大军，采取了紧急的预防措施，投入战斗，打了一个有比较充分准备的胜仗。贵州省罗甸县罗烟人民公社5月2日接县气象站预报4到7日内将有暴风骤雨和冰雹。为了确保夏收作物颗粒还家，公社党委立即向全体社员和干部做了紧急动员，组织了六千三百多人的抢收大军，早起晚睡，连日激战，苦干三天，抢收了二千八百零一亩已经黄熟的小麦。到5月4日晚上，一阵大风到来，紧接着雷雨冰雹交加的时候，社员们已在兴高彩烈地开会总结这次战斗的经验，并研究下一步的生产计划。四川省从4月份起各地都出现了不同程度的干旱现象，5月3日成都中心气象台和区气象台会商天气，预计将有暴风雨出现，就由各专区气象台分别发出4、5两日的大风大雨和暴雨天气警报，并提出了抢水蓄水和抢收已经成熟的小春作物的重要措施，经各地气象（候）站又根据当地情况分别做出了更具体的预报和措施，立即向各级党委汇报，各级党委都很重视，立即召开紧急电话会议，要求各级领导带头，发动广大群众参加抢水蓄水保水和抢种工作。
    现在各级气象部门正在加紧戒备，抓紧进行有关做好夏季灾害性天气预报的学习和技术总结；检查各级气象单位对防汛和夏收夏种的气象服务组织工作，加强各台、站、哨间的情报联系和协作；了解各生产部门对气象方面的新要求；并号召所有气象台、站、哨组，广泛开展补充预报和农业气象预报，发挥各级气象单位对于做好防汛、夏收夏种的气象服务的积极作用。（附图片）
