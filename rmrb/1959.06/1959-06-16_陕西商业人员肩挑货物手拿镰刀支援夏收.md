Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 14th: In Shaanxi Province, many commercial workers are shouldering goods and holding sickles, heading to the fields to support the summer harvest.

In the wheat fields of the 800-li Qin Chuan plain, commercial workers can be seen everywhere. According to incomplete statistics from only four counties and cities, Xi'an, Weinan, Dali, and Yu County, more than 7,300 commercial workers have gone to the countryside to support the summer harvest. They proposed that wherever the summer harvest goes, supplies should follow. Under the unified leadership of the local summer harvest headquarters, they are assigned to specific areas to deliver goods to the fields, and after selling the goods, they wield sickles to help with the harvest. In addition to organizing a large number of peddlers for mobile supply, the commercial departments have also added distribution stations in the people's commune management areas for timely supply. Stores in Lianhu, Yanta and other districts of Xi'an City also proactively deliver cigarettes, towels, and straw hats to the teams, and oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar to rural canteens or commune members' homes.

    陕西商业人员肩挑货物手拿镰刀支援夏收
    据新华社西安14日电　陕西省许多商业人员肩挑货物、手持镰刀，分赴田间支援夏收。
    在八百里秦川的麦海里，处处能看到商业人员在活动。仅据西安、渭南、大荔、雩县四个县、市不完全统计，就有七千三百多名商业人员下乡支援夏收。他们提出夏收到那里，供应就到那里。他们在当地夏收指挥部统一领导下，划片包干送货下田，卖货完毕，便挥镰助收。商业部门除了组织大批货郎担流动供应以外，还在人民公社管理区增设分销站，随时供应。西安市莲湖、雁塔等区的商店，还主动把纸烟、毛巾、草帽送到队，把油盐酱醋送到农村食堂或社员家里。
