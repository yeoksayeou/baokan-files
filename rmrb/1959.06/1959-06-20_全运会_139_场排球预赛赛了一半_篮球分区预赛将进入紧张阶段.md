From June 14th to 18th, the teams held a total of eighty-eight matches in various competition zones, and it is now generally clear which teams will qualify for the finals.

In the Harbin competition zone, the matches have been very intense in recent days. The women's competition, in particular, has been highly competitive. The Guangdong, Shanxi, and Jilin women's teams have all won four matches in four games since the competition began on the 14th, but many of these matches were decided by a few points difference near the end. In the men's category, the Jilin and Liaoning teams still have the best results among the seven teams. The Jilin team, which has a center, Chen Xuewen, who is 2.02 meters tall, has won all four of its matches. The technically proficient Liaoning team has won all three of its matches.

In the men's category, the Beijing team and the Jiangsu team have both won four matches in four games. Although the Guangdong team lost one of the three matches they have already participated in (losing to the Beijing team by a score of 82-87), this team, which has a center, Zhang Guanglu, who is 2.02 meters tall, remains a strong opponent for the other teams.
