    Synthetic Detergent
    Synthetic detergent is a new type of cleaning product. The biggest difference between it and ordinary soap and soap powder is that it uses mineral oil as its main raw material. In industrialized countries, synthetic detergents have been widely used to replace soap made from edible oil.
    Synthetic detergents are superior to soap in some properties. They have the same cleaning power in river water, well water, and seawater. They are labor-saving and do not damage clothing when used. Soaking dirty clothes in a solution of synthetic detergent for half an hour to an hour will dissolve the dirt on its own, making it particularly suitable for units that wash large quantities of clothes.

    合成洗涤剂
    合成洗涤剂是一种新的洗涤用品，它与一般肥皂、皂粉最大的不同点是采用矿物油为主要原料。在工业发达的国家，已大量采用合成洗涤剂来代替用食用油制造的肥皂。
    合成洗涤剂在某些性能上比肥皂优越，它在河水、井水、海水中都具有同样的去污能力，使用时省力而不伤衣料，将污衣浸于合成洗涤剂的溶液中半小时到一小时污垢即自行溶解，特别适于洗涤大量衣服的单位使用。
