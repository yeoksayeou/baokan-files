Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 25th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru flew back to Delhi today after a three-day visit to Kerala. Nehru visited Kerala at the invitation of the Chief Minister of Kerala, Communist Party of India leader Namboodiripad, to inspect the activities of opposition parties in the state attempting to overthrow the state government.

Speaking at Delhi Airport after leaving Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala, Nehru mentioned twice that he believed the solution to the state's problems was to hold new elections.

Nehru also said that the opposition's instigation activities in the state were "essentially a people's uprising." He believed that such activities would continue "because there is a strong sentiment behind it." However, he expressed disapproval of the practice of setting up "pickets" and stopping transportation.

Namboodiripad stated in a statement on the evening of the 24th that Prime Minister Nehru had put forward some suggestions. He hoped that the Kerala state government would discuss these suggestions with people from all walks of life when implementing them, in order to first ease the situation and finally resolve the outstanding issues.

According to "The Statesman," these suggestions included holding a round table conference to discuss the opposition's grievances; suspending the controversial parts of the education law; and jointly investigating the recent police shooting incident.

Earlier, Namboodiripad said that he was willing to discuss any issue with the opposition, but not the issue of the government's resignation.

According to today's newspapers, the Kerala State Congress Committee passed a resolution approving the movement launched by the Congress Party in the state to overthrow the current government, and demanded that all necessary steps be taken to make the movement a success.

According to the Indian News Service, schools in six of the nine districts of Kerala have started classes.

The Press Trust of India reported from Trivandrum on the 24th: "The Congress Party has been criticized by a section of the public opinion with considerable influence in the country, who expressed dissatisfaction with the role it played in this opposition-launched movement. People raised a question to it: Is it justified for the Congress Party to indulge in unconstitutional means to overthrow a government established in accordance with the constitution?"

The Press Trust of India also reported that the leading bodies of some political parties in India are holding and will hold meetings to discuss the situation in Kerala. After Nehru returns to Delhi, the Congress Parliamentary Party will hold a meeting on the 26th; the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of India will hold a meeting on the 25th, and the leading bodies of the People's Socialist Party and the Indian People's League have also or will hold meetings.

This newspaper reported that according to Indian newspapers, opposition parties and sectarian forces in Kerala continue to plot to expand the movement to overthrow the state government, and are preparing to use "direct action" on June 26 to put the state government into a state of "paralysis."

The movement against the state government led by the Communist Party of India in Kerala began on June 1 this year. June 1 was the day when the Kerala state government was scheduled to implement the education law it recently formulated and approved by the President of India. This education law aims to improve education management, improve teacher quality, and improve teacher treatment. However, the opposition parties in Kerala used the excuse of opposing the education law to launch a movement to overthrow the state government. As early as April and May this year, they began to plan this movement around the education bill. On May 13, the leader of the Kerala Congress Party discussed with the highest authorities of the Congress Party the plan to oppose the state government throughout the state. The People's Socialist Party, the Muslim League, and the Catholic Church and other sectarian forces in Kerala participated in the movement against the state government. Soon, the Congress Party, the People's Socialist Party, and the Muslim League in the state issued a joint statement, demanding that the people in the state hold a so-called "Liberation Day" on June 12 to demand the resignation of the state government. The Congress Party also established an "Action Committee" to carry out agitation work. The Kerala Committee of the Indian National Trade Union Congress of the Congress Party also called on workers to strike on the 12th on June 7. The Catholic Church not only used the closure of schools and threats to other schools that continue to operate as a means to undermine the implementation of the state government's education law, but even recruited "suicide squads" and "volunteers," and issued them weapons, and trained them by the Catholic National Military Training Corps to fight against the government.

Since the so-called "Liberation Day" was held on June 12, opposition parties and sectarian forces have taken various violent actions. Leaders of the Kerala Congress Party and the People's Socialist Party announced that they had decided to take "direct action" to deal with the state government. The opposition set up "pickets" at the entrances of the state government agencies, and members participating in the anti-state government movement raised black flags in several places in Trivandrum, the capital of the state. Some people wore black badges and carried black flags, forcing shops to close everywhere. A group of "demonstrators" stabbed three people with knives while trying to forcibly close a barbershop. Groups of three to five thugs lay down at the school gate and injured students going to school with stones. The Catholic Church, the Nair Service Society (an influential Hindu clan), and other sects also instigated thugs to set fire to schools. When the police intervened, the thugs surrounded the police station and attacked the police with sticks, foreign knives and murder weapons, so that the police were forced to shoot to stop them. In order to maintain social order, the state government arrested a group of troublemakers engaged in sabotage activities.

In the course of the incident, the state government warned the initiators of the anti-government movement that the government would not tolerate unconstitutional activities, and called on the masses to stop violent actions and oppose the illegal sending of "pickets" to monitor government agencies and schools. The state government also ordered on June 12 to prohibit any private organization from conducting military exercises, activities or drills in the former Trivandrum-Cochin area of the state. On June 15, the state government ordered a ban on torch parades in Trivandrum within fifteen days. The state government, with the support of the people, has complete control of the situation. The Chief Minister of the state and one of the leaders of the Communist Party of India, Namboodiripad, invited Indian Prime Minister Nehru to visit Kerala, and Nehru arrived in Trivandrum, the capital of the state, on the 22nd.

According to the Indian News Agency, Indian Prime Minister Nehru told the press on June 6: "It seems very clear that a dangerous situation full of the possibility of fierce conflict is rapidly forming in that state." He believes that those who oppose the state government "have the right to peacefully agitate and convince the people that their views and policies are correct. They can expect to change the government, as long as this is always achieved by democratic and peaceful means." Earlier, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, Chairman of the Indian National Congress, stated that the Kerala Congress Party might launch its own political movement against the Kerala state government in the short term. Shortly after she made this statement, Chacko, the leader of the Congress Party in the Kerala Legislative Assembly, said: "It is impossible to get rid of the Communist government through elections or in the Legislative Assembly. Only through the armed forces of the youth can the Communists be forced to step down."

When talking about the recent attempts of anti-government movements in the state, Kerala State Government Chief Minister Namboodiripad pointed out that the forces opposing the state government, jointly formed by the Congress Party, the People's Socialist Party, and the Muslim League, are afraid of the huge changes that will occur before the next election, when the state government will implement various reforms. Therefore, they linked the school closure movement and a series of other movements in an attempt to force the state government to resign. Communist Party of India General Secretary Ghosh recently pointed out in an article that the current agitation movement in Kerala aims to provoke "the central government to interfere and dissolve the Kerala state government."

The vast public opinion across India, including the people of Kerala, has expressed serious concern about the situation in Kerala. People across India actively responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India and held "Kerala State Week" from June 7. People and many educators in Delhi, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bombay State, and Madras State expressed their support for the Kerala state government and opposed the movement launched by the opposition parties in the state to overthrow the state government through rallies and demonstrations. Mass rallies have recently been held in various central regions of Kerala to support the Communist Party-led state government and condemn the movement against the education law and the overthrow of the Kerala state government.

According to the Press Trust of India, Madras, June 18, Indian political elder Rajagopalachari, when talking about the participation of Congressmen in the movement against the Kerala state government, said that this is a wrong and short-sighted adventure by the Kerala Congressmen, which will have far-reaching and bad consequences for the future of Indian representative government.

The Kerala state government led by the Communist Party of India was established after the general election in 1957. In the State Legislative Assembly, the Communist Party of India and independent persons supporting the Communist Party of India occupy a total of sixty-five seats, while the opposition parties such as the Congress Party, the People's Socialist Party, and the Muslim League occupy a total of sixty-one seats. For more than two years, the state government has taken various reform measures within the scope stipulated by the Indian Constitution and many central laws of India, such as passing laws on improving farmers' lives and land issues, reforming the education system, and developing industrial and agricultural production, and has achieved achievements in developing the state's economy and culture. State Chief Minister Namboodiripad once pointed out: "It is these economic and political reform measures that the whole country expects and I have implemented that have enabled us to continue to be in power for two years with a slight majority of two votes in the State Legislative Assembly."

    尼赫鲁离喀拉拉邦回德里
    国大党邦委员会批准开展推翻邦政府的运动
    新华社新德里25日电　印度总理尼赫鲁在喀拉拉邦进行了三天的访问后，今天坐飞机回到德里。尼赫鲁是应喀拉拉邦首席部长、印度共产党领袖南布迪里巴德的邀请，前往视察邦内的反对党企图推翻邦政府的活动的。
    尼赫鲁在离开喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅到达德里机场发表谈话时，两次都提到他认为解决这个邦的问题的出路是重新举行选举。
    尼赫鲁还说邦内反对党的煽动活动“本质上是人民的奋起”。他认为这种活动将要继续进行，“因为在它后面有着强烈的情绪”。但是他表示不赞成采取设置“纠察人员”和阻止交通工具运转的做法。
    南布迪里巴德在24日晚间发表声明说，尼赫鲁总理提出了一些建议。他希望喀拉拉邦政府在实行这些建议时，能够同各阶层人民进行讨论，以便首先缓和局势，最后解决悬而未决的问题。
    据“政治家报”报道，这些建议包括：举行圆桌会议来讨论反对党的不满意见；停止执行教育法中有争论的部分以及共同调查最近发生的警察开枪事件。
    早些时候，南布迪里巴德说，他愿意同反对党讨论任何问题，但是不讨论关于政府辞职的问题。
    据今天的报纸报道，喀拉拉邦国大党委员会通过了一项决议，批准了这个邦内国大党开展的推翻现政府的运动，并且要求采取一切必要的步骤来使这个运动获得成功。
    据印度新闻社报道，喀拉拉邦内九个县中已经有六个县的学校开始上课。
    印度报业托辣斯24日发自特里凡得琅的消息说：“国大党遭到国内舆论很有影响的一部分人的批评，他们对它在这次反对派发动的运动中所起的作用表示不满。人们向它提出一个问题：国大党沉迷于采取违反宪法的手段去推翻一个根据宪法建立的政府，这种作法是否正当？”
    印度报业托辣斯还报道，印度一些政党的领导机构正在和将要开会讨论喀拉拉邦局势的问题。在尼赫鲁回到德里以后，国大党议会党团将在26日举行会议；印度共产党中央执行委员会在25日举行会议，人民社会党和印度人民同盟的领导机构也已经或将要开会。
    本报讯　据印度报刊报道，喀拉拉邦内的反对党和教派势力继续策划扩大推翻邦政府的运动，准备在6月26日以“直接行动”使邦政府陷于“瘫痪状态”。
    喀拉拉邦内反对印度共产党领导的邦政府的运动，是从今年6月1日开始的。6月1日是喀拉拉邦政府预定实施它最近制定并经印度总统批准的教育法的日子。这个教育法旨在改进教育管理，提高教师质量，改善教师待遇。但喀拉拉邦的反对党派却借口反对教育法而开展推翻邦政府的运动。他们早在今年4、5月间就开始围绕教育法案问题，策划这一运动。5月13日，喀拉拉邦国大党领袖同国大党最高当局讨论了在全邦范围内反对邦政府的计划。喀拉拉邦的人民社会党、穆斯林联盟和天主教会等教派势力一起参加了反对邦政府的运动。不久，邦内的国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟发表联合声明，要求邦内人民在6月12日举行所谓“解放日”来要求邦政府辞职。国大党还成立了一个“行动委员会”进行鼓动工作。国大党的印度全国工会大会喀拉拉邦委员会在6月7日也号召工人在12日实行罢工。天主教会不仅以封闭学校和威胁继续开课的其它学校为手段，来破坏邦政府教育法的实施，甚至征募“敢死队”和“志愿军”，并且发给他们武器，由天主教全国军训队训练他们同政府作斗争。
    从6月12日举行所谓“解放日”起，反对党派和教派势力采取了各种暴力行动。喀拉拉邦国大党和人民社会党领袖宣布，决定采取“直接行动”来对付邦政府。反对党在邦政府机构的办公处门口设置“纠察人员”，参加反邦政府运动的分子在邦首府特里凡得琅市内的几个地方升起了黑旗。有一些人佩戴黑色徽章、手拿黑旗，到处强迫商店关门。有一批“示威者”在企图强行关闭一家理发馆时用刀刺伤了三个人。三五成群的暴徒躺在学校门口，并用石块打伤上学的学生。天主教会、奈尔服务社（一个有势力的印度教族）等教派，还主使暴徒纵火焚烧学校。暴徒们在警察进行干预时，竟包围警察局，拿着棍棒、洋刀和凶器袭击警察，以致警察被迫开枪，予以制止。邦政府为了维持社会秩序，逮捕了一批从事破坏活动的捣乱分子。
    在事件过程中，邦政府警告反对政府运动的发起者说，政府不会容忍违反宪法的活动，呼吁群众制止暴力行动，反对非法派“纠察员”监视政府机关和学校。邦政府并于6月12日下令禁止任何私人组织在这个邦的前特里凡得琅—柯钦地区进行军事性质的演习、活动或操练。6月15日邦政府下令在十五天内禁止在特里凡得琅举行火炬游行。邦政府在人民的支持下完全控制着局势。邦首席部长、印度共产党领袖之一南布迪里巴德邀请印度总理尼赫鲁访问喀拉拉邦，尼赫鲁已于22日到达邦首府特里凡得琅。
    据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁曾在6月6日对报界发表谈话说：“看来似乎很明显，一种充满着发生激烈冲突的可能性的危险局势正在那个邦迅速形成。”他认为，反对邦政府的那些人“有权和平地进行鼓动，使人民相信他们的观点和政策是正确的。他们可以期望改变政府，只要这总是用民主和和平的方法来实现就行”。早些时候，印度国大党主席英迪拉·甘地夫人表示，喀拉拉邦的国大党，在短期内可能发动一个它自己的反对喀拉拉邦政府的政治运动。在她发表这次谈话后不久，喀拉拉邦立法会议中的国大党领袖查科说：“通过选举或者在立法会议中搞掉共产党政府是不可能的。只有通过青年人的武器力量，才能使共产党人下台。”
    喀拉拉邦政府首席部长南布迪里巴德在谈到最近邦内反政府运动的企图时指出，由国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟联合组成的反对邦政府的力量，害怕在下次选举之前将发生巨大的变化，那时候邦政府将实行各种改革。因此，它们把关闭学校运动和其他一系列运动联系在一起，企图迫使邦政府辞职。印度共产党总书记高士最近在一篇文章中指出，目前喀拉拉邦内的煽动运动的目的是想招致“中央政府进行干涉并解散喀拉拉邦政府”。
    包括喀拉拉邦人民在内的印度全国广大公众舆论，对喀拉拉邦的局势表示了严重的关心。印度全国各地人民群众积极响应印共中央的号召，从6月7日起举行了“喀拉拉邦周”。德里、西孟加拉邦、北方邦、旁遮普邦、孟买邦和马德拉斯邦等地人民和许多教育工作者，通过集会和示威游行表示支持喀拉拉邦政府，并反对这个邦内的反对党发动的推翻邦政府的运动。喀拉拉邦的各个中心地区最近都举行了群众大会，支持共产党领导的邦政府，谴责反对教育法和推翻喀拉拉邦政府的运动。
    据印度报业托辣斯马德拉斯6月18日电，印度政界元老拉贾戈帕拉查里，在谈到国大党人参加反对喀拉拉邦政府的运动时说，这是喀拉拉邦国大党人的错误的和短视的冒险，它会对于印度代议政府的前途产生影响远大的坏的后果。
    印度共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府是在1957年经大选后成立的。在邦立法会议中，印共和支持印共的独立人士共占六十五席，国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟等反对派共占六十一席。两年多来，邦政府在印度宪法和印度许多中央法令规定的范围内采取了各种改革措施，如通过了有关改善农民生活和土地问题的法令、改革教育制度，以及发展工农业生产等，在发展邦内的经济、文化方面取得了成就。邦首席部长南布迪里巴德曾指出：“正是这些全国所期望、我所执行的经济和政治改革措施，才使得我们能够在邦立法会议中以微弱的两票多数而继续当政两年之久。”
