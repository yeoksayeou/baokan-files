Visiting Southern Shanxi During the Wheat Harvest Season
Shanxi Daily reporter collective writing

Southern Shanxi has always been known as the cotton and wheat region of Shanxi. Of the region's 17 million mu of cultivated land, 8.35 million mu are planted with wheat, accounting for more than half of the province's total wheat fields. The victory of this year's continued great leap forward in agriculture largely depends on the wheat harvest in Southern Shanxi. In this season of golden wheat ripening, who doesn't care about the news from Southern Shanxi? Who wouldn't want to see the wheat sea of the Southern Shanxi plains?

On May 27th, we arrived in Linfen. We heard that the wheat in the southernmost areas along the Yellow River was already turning yellow and the harvest had begun, so we hurried to Pinglu. Then, from Pinglu to Ruicheng, we looked north along Fengling渡, passing through Ruicheng, Yuncheng, Wenxi, and Houma before turning west to Jishan. From Jishan, we returned to Linfen. On June 11th, we arrived in Hongtong, just as the wheat harvest was entering its climax. In about half a month, we traveled about two thousand li, covering most of the major wheat-producing areas of Southern Shanxi. Although it was a whirlwind tour, we not only looked at the areas along the railway and highway, but also specifically visited some more remote and backward places. We interviewed the responsible comrades of the CPC Jinan Prefectural Committee and the Pinglu, Wenxi, Jishan, and Hongtong County Committees, as well as many cadres from communes and management districts, and some model workers and veteran farmers. During the wheat harvest season in Southern Shanxi, everywhere was filled with tension, busyness, joy, and happiness. It's truly: "The fields are the battlefield, the moon is the sun, men and women are mobilized together, abundant harvest brings joy." Every day before dawn, energetic people set out with their sickles; villages and towns were quiet and empty, with many shops displaying signs saying "Closed for summer harvest"; in the evening, the villages were lively, with commune members shouting at livestock pulling carts loaded with heavy wheat back to the village, and the broadcasting constantly reporting the day's victories, and songs and laughter floating in the dining halls and threshing grounds. If we summarize what we saw and heard, we have one strong impression: after communization, Southern Shanxi's wheat has had another bumper harvest, and this year's first battle of the continued great leap forward in agriculture has been a great victory.

A Moving Scene of Harvest
This scene and atmosphere of great harvest and great leap forward cannot but greatly encourage anyone who goes to Southern Shanxi. A conductor on the Nantongpu Railway said that the passengers passing through also praised this year's wheat in Southern Shanxi. Some people just arrived in Hongtong and exclaimed, "This is the best wheat!" Soon the train arrived in Wenxi, and they denied their views, thinking that Wenxi wheat could not be better. Several hours later, when the train arrived in Jieyu and Yongji area, he was surprised to say that it was even better here, truly there is a heaven beyond heaven. In fact, looking from the train, you can only see a rough idea. Running into the sea of wheat, look, the vast field is boundless, the ripe golden wheat is taller than the chest, the ears are strong, the stalks are thick, dense and uniform, a gust of wind comes, the wheat waves rolling, the wheat fragrance is blowing, it is really exciting!

Is all the wheat so good? Of course, ten fingers cannot be the same length. Each county still has a certain number of third-class wheat, accounting for about 20%. However, this year's third-class wheat is also different from the previous third-class wheat, and the sparse wheat that was previously called "ghost incense" has almost disappeared. In some places, the third-class wheat has caught up after later processing, and can also hit more than two hundred pounds. We lived in Xiyan Village in Pinglu for a day. Of the 892 mu of wheat here, half is paddy field and half is dry land, and the third-class wheat has been completely eliminated. Some people may think that this is an advanced village and cannot represent the general. Zhaitou, ten miles away from it, used to be a famous backward village, and only turned over in the great leap forward last year, and continued the great leap forward this year, and the wheat yield per mu increased from 150 jin to 270 jin. In Jishan, we visited the seven communes of Hejin, Fancun, Senglou, Liwang, Xiedian, Zhaidian, and Chengguan, and the wheat was better than the other, and there was no place that was not a great harvest and a great leap forward. Management areas with an average yield of more than 400 jin per mu include Sanqian Village, Xiguan, Weijiayuan, Xiwei, Sanjiezhuang, Fancun, etc. The "Hejin Five Wheat Kings" that were famous in the province last year are now thriving and have become a large-scale high-yield. We also visited the Qingjian Management Area, which was called the "bottom of the pot" in the former Hejin County. This village is close to the Yellow River, and most of it is white sandy land, and the land is particularly barren, and it has been a grain-deficient village for many years. When we went, the wheat had all been harvested, and the results of some trial threshing could reach more than 220 jin. They are preparing to sell 180,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, and each commune member can also eat 100 jin more wheat than last year. Similar examples can be cited a lot. In short, despite the imbalance, the whole is a great harvest and a great leap forward.

How big is the leap forward? What is the average yield per mu in Southern Shanxi? This is still an unsolved mystery. According to our on-the-spot observation and understanding, the estimated yield is generally 10% to 15% lower than the actual yield. Of course, there are also estimates that are high, but it is rare. The reason for the low estimation is, on the one hand, that the grassroots cadres are afraid that the estimation will be too high, causing passivity in the work, and they have the idea of preferring low to high; on the other hand, this year's wheat has been deeply plowed, densely planted, timely topdressed, the rain is evenly distributed, and the processing is thorough, and the grains are particularly full. Indeed, even the most experienced old farmers are not easy to "estimate accurately." However, they have a bottom line in their hearts about the great harvest, because in the past, one person could harvest two or three mu of wheat a day, but this year it is difficult to harvest one mu; in the past, a large cart could pull two mu of wheat, but this year it is good to pull seven or eight minutes. Before half of the wheat in many villages was harvested, all the threshing grounds were full, and new grounds had to be temporarily milled. Old men of age said with a smile, this is really a fresh thing that the ancestors have never seen.

Attributed to the "Eight-Character Constitution"
Why is the wheat so good this year? The masses attribute it to the communization under the leadership of the party, and to the agricultural eight-character constitution. There was an interesting debate at a symposium in the Fancun Management Area of the Fancun Commune in Jishan County. The old man Ren Yinkui said: "The wheat grows well this year, first, our land here is good, it is willing to grasp the seeds, and it is drought-resistant and water-resistant; second, the God helped, and the three rains fell at the right time. The land is good, and the rain is timely, so it can't be bad?" Everyone disagreed, some said thanks to dense planting, some said thanks to more fertilizer, and some said thanks to careful processing. Finally, Ren Yuezi, 75 years old, said: "I am the oldest of those present, to be honest, I have never seen such good wheat this year, nor have I seen such dense sowing, so much fertilizer, and such careful processing. I have seen the favorable weather, not just this year. Why is the yield only the highest this year? I think it is still the credit of the party's leadership. People account for seven points of merit, and it is fair to give God three points of merit." The "eight-character constitution" is a magic weapon for high yield, which has been recognized by the masses. Model worker Zhou Quande said: "Chairman Mao has proposed the method for us, it depends on whether you can do it or not. As long as you do it word by word according to the eight-character constitution, the high yield will not run away!" Everyone felt that the biggest advantage was dense planting. This year, the wheat in the paddy fields in various counties in Southern Shanxi generally seeded 30 to 35 jin per mu, and the dry land seeded 20 to 25 jin. Facts have proved that this is a relatively reasonable number. As the saying goes, sparse fields cannot beat dense fields, and dense fields cannot beat uniform fields. This year, the wheat is dense and uniform, there is goods in the rows, and the more you harvest, the more it shows that it is different from previous years. Of course, dense planting cannot be without limits. We also saw that some experimental fields were not good because they seeded too much. The experimental fields were deeply plowed and fertilized enough. Generally, those with about 100 jin of seeds grew normally, but there were fewer tillers and the ears were small, and the yield was similar to that of 40 jin of seeds. Those with more than 150 jin of seeds often had severe lodging. Some could still receive about 1,000 jin after rescue, but it took a lot of work and investment, and it was not cost-effective. This is a lesson that should be learned.

Grows Well and Harvests Well
The wheat is growing well, and a great harvest is a foregone conclusion. How is the harvesting work going? The characteristics of this year's summer harvest in Southern Shanxi are: strong leadership, strict organization, full preparation, and rapid and meticulous work. Before the summer harvest, various counties universally carried out ideological mobilization and set off a climax of the "red diligent and skillful" labor competition. Many places have signed summer harvest covenants in every household. At the same time, the cafeteria work was improved, and the members' lives were properly arranged. The preparation of tools is also very sufficient, and the region has as many as 1.79 million sickles. The labor force participating in the summer harvest has an average of one and a half sickles per person. The party committees at all levels are fully committed to leading the summer harvest. All counties have organized summer harvest headquarters and implemented the secretary's command. Pinglu extracted more than 620 cadres from various agencies in the county and assigned them to various communes, management districts, and production teams according to the original system. They worked as members for short-term labor exercises and were responsible for the summer harvest work. The benefits of doing this are that, first, it can ensure that each commune has a county party committee member to lead, each management area has a district-level or above cadre to command, and each production team has a full-time cadre to lead; second, the cadres sent down do not act alone, but go in an organized manner according to the system, which is convenient for mutual competition; third, closely combine labor exercises with helping work, and the entire summer harvest, from harvesting, yield verification, warehousing, unified purchase, etc., are all the responsibility of the cadres sent down. All of the region's 1.2 million agricultural labor forces have been organized and put into the intense battle. Cadres, troops, workers, and students participating in the summer harvest reached 300,000. According to the strength of the labor force, various places have organized specialized teams for harvesting, transportation, and threshing, and implemented fixed plots, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed remuneration. Some places contract tasks according to people and set work according to tasks, and the members are more enthusiastic. Harvesting wheat is "seizing food from the mouth of the dragon", and it must be harvested and threshed quickly. Many places have organized wheat field observation teams to ensure that one piece is harvested as it ripens. Strive to achieve "clean in seven days, light in ten days, and grain in the barn in half a month." Whenever the radio station forecasts that wind and rain are coming, it is even more tense. The entire mobilization, went to the battlefield together, acted bravely, rushed to harvest, and did not let the wheat suffer a little loss. Quick harvest and quick threshing are not counted, but also careful harvest and careful threshing. No matter which village you go to, you can meet the wheat-picking teams of the Young Pioneers. Their slogan is "Do not lose a spike." We asked the children who picked wheat in several places, and they could pick up about 10 to 15 jin of wheat per mu. The region can count a total of more than 100 million jin. What a considerable number this is!

The four million people in Southern Shanxi are immersed in the joy of the great harvest. Their enthusiasm is even greater, their confidence is even higher, and they are preparing to sell more wheat to the state.

    麦收季节访晋南
    山西日报记者集体采写
    晋南素来被称为山西的棉麦之乡。全区一千七百万亩耕地，就有八百三十五万亩种的是小麦，占全省麦田总数一半以上。今年农业继续大跃进第一仗的胜利，在很大程度上要取决于晋南的麦收。当这杏黄麦熟的季节，谁不关心晋南的消息？谁不想看看晋南平川的麦海？
      5月27日，我们到了临汾。听说最南端黄河沿岸地区麦已蜡黄，开镰收割，便赶紧赶到平陆。然后由平陆到芮城，从风陵渡一路往北看，经过芮城、运城、闻喜、侯马折向西，到了稷山。再由稷山返回临汾。6月11日到洪洞，正是麦收进入高潮的时候。前后半个多月，行程约二千里，晋南主要产麦区大部都跑到了，虽然是走马观花，但是我们除了在铁路、公路沿线看，也专门去看了一些比较偏僻和比较落后的地方；我们访问了中共晋南地委及平陆、闻喜、稷山、洪洞县委的负责同志，还访问了许多公社、管理区的干部和一些劳动模范及老农。麦收季节的晋南，到处是紧张、繁忙，到处是喜悦、欢乐。真是：“田间是战场，月亮当太阳，男男女女齐发动，丰产丰收喜洋洋。”每天天不亮，生龙活虎似的人们就拿着镰刀出发了；村庄和城镇都是静悄悄、空荡荡的，许多商店挂着“全体参加夏收暂停营业”的牌子；到了晚上，村子里可就热闹了，社员们吆喝着牲口拉着满车重甸甸的麦子回村，广播筒不断传出当天的捷报，食堂、打麦场上飘荡着歌声和笑语。如果把所见所闻概括起来，我们一个强烈的印象是：公社化以后晋南小麦又大丰收了，今年农业继续大跃进的第一仗又大胜利了。
      动人的丰收情景
    这种大丰收、大跃进的景象和气氛，使任何一个到晋南去的人都不能不受到巨大的鼓舞。南同蒲路一位列车长说，过路的旅客对今
  年晋南的麦子也赞不绝口。有些人刚到洪洞就叫起来，“这是最好的小麦！”不久车到闻喜，又否定了
  自己的看法，认为闻喜小麦再好不过了。几个钟头之后，车到解虞、永济一带，他又惊讶地说，原来这里更好，真是天外有天。其实，临车眺望，还只能看个大概。跑到麦海之中，你看吧，辽阔的原野一望无际，成熟了的金黄的麦子高过胸脯，穗子壮，秸秆粗，又稠又匀，一阵风来，麦浪滚滚，麦香扑鼻，才真是叫人兴奋哩！
    是不是所有麦子都这样好呢？当然十个指头总不能一般齐。各个县都还有一定数量的三类麦，约占20％左右。但是，今年的三类麦也不同于往年的三类麦，过去被称为“鬼烧香”那种稀稀拉拉的麦子几乎绝迹了。有些地方三类麦经过后期加工，迎头赶上，也可以打到二百斤以上。我们在平陆的西延村住了一天，这里八百九十二亩小麦，一半水地，一半旱地，彻底消灭了三类麦。也许有人认为这是先进村，不能代表一般。离它十里的寨头，是过去出名的落后村，去年大跃进才翻身，今年又继续大跃进，小麦亩产由一百五十斤提高到二百七十斤。在稷山，我们访问了河津、樊村、僧楼、里望、解店、翟店、城关七个公社，麦子一处胜一处，没有一处不是大丰收、大跃进。平均亩产四百斤以上的管理区有三迁庄、西关、魏家院、西磑、三界庄、樊村等七个。去年闻名全省的
  “河津五麦王”，如今子孙兴旺，变成大面积的丰产了。我们还访问了被称为原河津县“锅底”的清间管理区，这个村临近黄河，大部是白沙地，土地特别瘠薄，历年是缺粮村。我们去的时候，麦已全部割完，部分试打的结果可以达到二百二十斤以上。他们准备卖给国家十八万斤余粮，每个社员还可以比去年多吃一百斤小麦。类似的例子可以举出很多。总之，尽管不平衡，整个看来却是大丰收、大跃进。
    跃进的幅度到底有多大？全晋南平均亩产可以达到多少？这还是个没有揭晓的谜。据我们实地观察和了解，估产一般要低于实产10％到15％。当然也有估得高的，但是百难找一。估产低的原因，一方面是基层干部怕估得高了，造成工作上的被动，有宁低勿高的思想；另一方面今年小麦经过深翻，密植，追肥及时，雨水调匀，加工周到，颗粒特别饱满，确实连最有经验的老农也不容易“估透”。不过他们心里对大丰收却有个底，因为往年一人一天可以割二、三亩麦，今年一亩也难割完；往年一大车可以拉二亩麦，今年拉七、八分也就满不错了。不少村子的麦没割倒一半，所有的麦场便都满场了，不得不临时另碾新场。上年纪的老汉们笑嘻嘻地说，这真是祖辈至今没见过的新鲜事。
    归功于“八字宪法”
    为什么今年小麦这么好呢？群众把它归功于党领导下的公社化，归功于农业八字宪法。稷山县樊村公社樊村管理区一次座谈会上有过有趣的争论。任银奎老汉说：“今年小麦长得好，一则是咱这里地板好，肯抓籽，耐旱又耐涝；二则老天爷助了兴，三场雨下得挺适时。土头既好，雨又适时，那能不好？”大家都不同意，有的说多亏种得密，有的说多亏上肥多，有的说多亏加工细。最后七十五岁的任悦子说；“在场的数我年岁大，老实说，我没见过今年这么好的小麦，也没见过下籽这么稠，上肥这么多，加工这么细。风调雨顺，我见的不是一年啦，为什么只有今年产量最高呢？我看还是党的领导功劳大，人占七分功，给老天爷分上三分功也就公道了。”“八字宪法”是丰产的法宝，这已经是广大群众公认的了。劳动模范周全德说：“办法毛主席都给咱提出来啦，就看你做到做不到。只要按八字宪法一个字一个字去做，丰产就没跑！”大家觉得沾光最大的是密植。今年晋南各县水地小麦一般每亩下籽三十到三十五斤，旱地二十到二十五斤，事实证明这是比较合理的数字。俗话说，稀田打不过稠田、稠田打不过匀田，今年小麦又稠又匀，垅里有货，越割越显出与往年不同。当然密植不能没有限度，我们也看到有些试验田因为下籽过多，反而不好了。试验田翻得深、肥也足，一般下籽百斤左右的，生长还正常，但是分蘖少，穗子小，产量与下籽四十斤的仿佛。下籽一百五十斤以上的，往往发生严重的倒伏现象，有些经过抢救，还可以收到千斤左右，但是费工多，投资大，很不合算。这是应该记取的教训。
          长得好收得也好
    麦子长得好，大丰收已成定局，收割工作做得怎样呢？今年晋南夏收工作的特点是：领导坚强，组织严密，准备充分，迅速细致。夏收前各县普遍进行了思想发动，掀起了“红勤巧”劳动竞赛的高潮。许多地方家家户户都订立了夏收公约。同时，改进食堂工作，对社员生活作了妥善的安排。工具的准备也很充分，仅镰刀一项全区就有一百七十九万把。参加夏收的劳力平均每人一把半。各级党委对夏收领导是全力以赴，各县都组织了夏收指挥部，实行书记挂帅。平陆从全县各机关中抽出六百二十多名干部，按原系统分别分配到各公社、管理区和生产队，一面当社员进行短期劳动锻炼，一面负责夏收工作。这样做的好处是，第一，可以保证每个公社有一个县委委员领导，每个管理区有一个区级以上干部指挥，每个生产队有个脱产干部带领；第二，派下去的干部不是单独行动，而是按系统有组织去的，便于相互开展竞赛；第三，把劳动锻炼和帮助工作紧密结合，整个夏收从收割、产量核实、入库、统购等工作，都有派下去的干部负责到底。全区一百二十余万农业劳力，已全部组织起来投入紧张的战斗。干部、军队、职工、学生参加夏收的达三十万人。按劳力强弱，各地分别组织了收割、运输、打场等专业队，实行定地块、定时间、定质量、定报酬。有些地方按人包任务，按任务定工，社员干劲更大。收麦是“龙口夺食”，要快收快打，许多地方组织了麦田观察小组，确保熟一块割一块。力争做到“七天地净，十天场光，半月颗粒归仓。”每当广播站预报风雨袭来的时候，那更是紧张。全体总动员，一齐上战场，动作勇猛，抢收突击，不让麦子受到一点损失。快收快打不算，还要细收细打。无论到那一个村，都能遇到红领巾们的拾麦队。他们的口号是“不丢一株穗”。我们在好几个地方问过拾麦的小朋友，每亩大概可以拾回十到十五斤小麦，全区总算一笔账，就是一亿多斤。这是个多么可观的数字啊！
    晋南四百万人民沉浸在大丰收的喜悦中，他们的干劲更足了，信心更高了，纷纷准备向国家出售更多的小麦。
