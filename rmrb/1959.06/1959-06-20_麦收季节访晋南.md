Visiting Southern Shanxi During the Wheat Harvest Season
Shanxi Daily reporter collective writing

Southern Shanxi has always been known as the cotton and wheat region of Shanxi. Of the region's 17 million mu of cultivated land, 8.35 million mu are planted with wheat, accounting for more than half of the province's total wheat fields. The victory of this year's continued great leap forward in agriculture largely depends on the wheat harvest in Southern Shanxi. In this season of golden wheat ripening, who doesn't care about the news from Southern Shanxi? Who wouldn't want to see the wheat sea of the Southern Shanxi plains?

On May 27th, we arrived in Linfen. We heard that the wheat in the southernmost areas along the Yellow River was already turning yellow and the harvest had begun, so we hurried to Pinglu. Then, from Pinglu to Ruicheng, we looked north along Fenglingæ¸¡, passing through Ruicheng, Yuncheng, Wenxi, and Houma before turning west to Jishan. From Jishan, we returned to Linfen. On June 11th, we arrived in Hongtong, just as the wheat harvest was entering its climax. In about half a month, we traveled about two thousand li, covering most of the major wheat-producing areas of Southern Shanxi. Although it was a whirlwind tour, we not only looked at the areas along the railway and highway, but also specifically visited some more remote and backward places. We interviewed the responsible comrades of the CPC Jinan Prefectural Committee and the Pinglu, Wenxi, Jishan, and Hongtong County Committees, as well as many cadres from communes and management districts, and some model workers and veteran farmers. During the wheat harvest season in Southern Shanxi, everywhere was filled with tension, busyness, joy, and happiness. It's truly: "The fields are the battlefield, the moon is the sun, men and women are mobilized together, abundant harvest brings joy." Every day before dawn, energetic people set out with their sickles; villages and towns were quiet and empty, with many shops displaying signs saying "Closed for summer harvest"; in the evening, the villages were lively, with commune members shouting at livestock pulling carts loaded with heavy wheat back to the village, and the broadcasting constantly reporting the day's victories, and songs and laughter floating in the dining halls and threshing grounds. If we summarize what we saw and heard, we have one strong impression: after communization, Southern Shanxi's wheat has had another bumper harvest, and this year's first battle of the continued great leap forward in agriculture has been a great victory.

A Moving Scene of Harvest
This scene and atmosphere of great harvest and great leap forward cannot but greatly encourage anyone who goes to Southern Shanxi. A conductor on the Nantongpu Railway said that the passengers passing through also praised this year's wheat in Southern Shanxi. Some people just arrived in Hongtong and exclaimed, "This is the best wheat!" Soon the train arrived in Wenxi, and they denied their views, thinking that Wenxi wheat could not be better. Several hours later, when the train arrived in Jieyu and Yongji area, he was surprised to say that it was even better here, truly there is a heaven beyond heaven. In fact, looking from the train, you can only see a rough idea. Running into the sea of wheat, look, the vast field is boundless, the ripe golden wheat is taller than the chest, the ears are strong, the stalks are thick, dense and uniform, a gust of wind comes, the wheat waves rolling, the wheat fragrance is blowing, it is really exciting!

Is all the wheat so good? Of course, ten fingers cannot be the same length. Each county still has a certain number of third-class wheat, accounting for about 20%. However, this year's third-class wheat is also different from the previous third-class wheat, and the sparse wheat that was previously called "ghost incense" has almost disappeared. In some places, the third-class wheat has caught up after later processing, and can also hit more than two hundred pounds. We lived in Xiyan Village in Pinglu for a day. Of the 892 mu of wheat here, half is paddy field and half is dry land, and the third-class wheat has been completely eliminated. Some people may think that this is an advanced village and cannot represent the general. Zhaitou, ten miles away from it, used to be a famous backward village, and only turned over in the great leap forward last year, and continued the great leap forward this year, and the wheat yield per mu increased from 150 jin to 270 jin. In Jishan, we visited the seven communes of Hejin, Fancun, Senglou, Liwang, Xiedian, Zhaidian, and Chengguan, and the wheat was better than the other, and there was no place that was not a great harvest and a great leap forward. Management areas with an average yield of more than 400 jin per mu include Sanqian Village, Xiguan, Weijiayuan, Xiwei, Sanjiezhuang, Fancun, etc. The "Hejin Five Wheat Kings" that were famous in the province last year are now thriving and have become a large-scale high-yield. We also visited the Qingjian Management Area, which was called the "bottom of the pot" in the former Hejin County. This village is close to the Yellow River, and most of it is white sandy land, and the land is particularly barren, and it has been a grain-deficient village for many years. When we went, the wheat had all been harvested, and the results of some trial threshing could reach more than 220 jin. They are preparing to sell 180,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, and each commune member can also eat 100 jin more wheat than last year. Similar examples can be cited a lot. In short, despite the imbalance, the whole is a great harvest and a great leap forward.

How big is the leap forward? What is the average yield per mu in Southern Shanxi? This is still an unsolved mystery. According to our on-the-spot observation and understanding, the estimated yield is generally 10% to 15% lower than the actual yield. Of course, there are also estimates that are high, but it is rare. The reason for the low estimation is, on the one hand, that the grassroots cadres are afraid that the estimation will be too high, causing passivity in the work, and they have the idea of preferring low to high; on the other hand, this year's wheat has been deeply plowed, densely planted, timely topdressed, the rain is evenly distributed, and the processing is thorough, and the grains are particularly full. Indeed, even the most experienced old farmers are not easy to "estimate accurately." However, they have a bottom line in their hearts about the great harvest, because in the past, one person could harvest two or three mu of wheat a day, but this year it is difficult to harvest one mu; in the past, a large cart could pull two mu of wheat, but this year it is good to pull seven or eight minutes. Before half of the wheat in many villages was harvested, all the threshing grounds were full, and new grounds had to be temporarily milled. Old men of age said with a smile, this is really a fresh thing that the ancestors have never seen.

Attributed to the "Eight-Character Constitution"
Why is the wheat so good this year? The masses attribute it to the communization under the leadership of the party, and to the agricultural eight-character constitution. There was an interesting debate at a symposium in the Fancun Management Area of the Fancun Commune in Jishan County. The old man Ren Yinkui said: "The wheat grows well this year, first, our land here is good, it is willing to grasp the seeds, and it is drought-resistant and water-resistant; second, the God helped, and the three rains fell at the right time. The land is good, and the rain is timely, so it can't be bad?" Everyone disagreed, some said thanks to dense planting, some said thanks to more fertilizer, and some said thanks to careful processing. Finally, Ren Yuezi, 75 years old, said: "I am the oldest of those present, to be honest, I have never seen such good wheat this year, nor have I seen such dense sowing, so much fertilizer, and such careful processing. I have seen the favorable weather, not just this year. Why is the yield only the highest this year? I think it is still the credit of the party's leadership. People account for seven points of merit, and it is fair to give God three points of merit." The "eight-character constitution" is a magic weapon for high yield, which has been recognized by the masses. Model worker Zhou Quande said: "Chairman Mao has proposed the method for us, it depends on whether you can do it or not. As long as you do it word by word according to the eight-character constitution, the high yield will not run away!" Everyone felt that the biggest advantage was dense planting. This year, the wheat in the paddy fields in various counties in Southern Shanxi generally seeded 30 to 35 jin per mu, and the dry land seeded 20 to 25 jin. Facts have proved that this is a relatively reasonable number. As the saying goes, sparse fields cannot beat dense fields, and dense fields cannot beat uniform fields. This year, the wheat is dense and uniform, there is goods in the rows, and the more you harvest, the more it shows that it is different from previous years. Of course, dense planting cannot be without limits. We also saw that some experimental fields were not good because they seeded too much. The experimental fields were deeply plowed and fertilized enough. Generally, those with about 100 jin of seeds grew normally, but there were fewer tillers and the ears were small, and the yield was similar to that of 40 jin of seeds. Those with more than 150 jin of seeds often had severe lodging. Some could still receive about 1,000 jin after rescue, but it took a lot of work and investment, and it was not cost-effective. This is a lesson that should be learned.

Grows Well and Harvests Well
The wheat is growing well, and a great harvest is a foregone conclusion. How is the harvesting work going? The characteristics of this year's summer harvest in Southern Shanxi are: strong leadership, strict organization, full preparation, and rapid and meticulous work. Before the summer harvest, various counties universally carried out ideological mobilization and set off a climax of the "red diligent and skillful" labor competition. Many places have signed summer harvest covenants in every household. At the same time, the cafeteria work was improved, and the members' lives were properly arranged. The preparation of tools is also very sufficient, and the region has as many as 1.79 million sickles. The labor force participating in the summer harvest has an average of one and a half sickles per person. The party committees at all levels are fully committed to leading the summer harvest. All counties have organized summer harvest headquarters and implemented the secretary's command. Pinglu extracted more than 620 cadres from various agencies in the county and assigned them to various communes, management districts, and production teams according to the original system. They worked as members for short-term labor exercises and were responsible for the summer harvest work. The benefits of doing this are that, first, it can ensure that each commune has a county party committee member to lead, each management area has a district-level or above cadre to command, and each production team has a full-time cadre to lead; second, the cadres sent down do not act alone, but go in an organized manner according to the system, which is convenient for mutual competition; third, closely combine labor exercises with helping work, and the entire summer harvest, from harvesting, yield verification, warehousing, unified purchase, etc., are all the responsibility of the cadres sent down. All of the region's 1.2 million agricultural labor forces have been organized and put into the intense battle. Cadres, troops, workers, and students participating in the summer harvest reached 300,000. According to the strength of the labor force, various places have organized specialized teams for harvesting, transportation, and threshing, and implemented fixed plots, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed remuneration. Some places contract tasks according to people and set work according to tasks, and the members are more enthusiastic. Harvesting wheat is "seizing food from the mouth of the dragon", and it must be harvested and threshed quickly. Many places have organized wheat field observation teams to ensure that one piece is harvested as it ripens. Strive to achieve "clean in seven days, light in ten days, and grain in the barn in half a month." Whenever the radio station forecasts that wind and rain are coming, it is even more tense. The entire mobilization, went to the battlefield together, acted bravely, rushed to harvest, and did not let the wheat suffer a little loss. Quick harvest and quick threshing are not counted, but also careful harvest and careful threshing. No matter which village you go to, you can meet the wheat-picking teams of the Young Pioneers. Their slogan is "Do not lose a spike." We asked the children who picked wheat in several places, and they could pick up about 10 to 15 jin of wheat per mu. The region can count a total of more than 100 million jin. What a considerable number this is!

The four million people in Southern Shanxi are immersed in the joy of the great harvest. Their enthusiasm is even greater, their confidence is even higher, and they are preparing to sell more wheat to the state.
