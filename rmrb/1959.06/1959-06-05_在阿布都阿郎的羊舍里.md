    In Abudu Alang's Sheepfold
    Yang Kexian
    The snow-covered peaks of the Tianshan Mountains, adorned in silver, are intermittently reflected in the turquoise blue Kongnais River. The snow on the mountains has begun to melt, and the tender green shoots of pasture grass have emerged at the foot of the mountains. Spring has arrived!

    Spring is the busiest and most rewarding season for herdsmen on the grasslands. To witness the herders' harvest scene, I planned to visit Abudu Alang.

    Abudu Alang is the son of a diligent and simple Kazakh poor herdsman. He has been herding sheep for over thirty years. He is familiar with the sheep's temperament and can distinguish whether they are sick, hungry, or missing their lambs based on their gaze, bleating, and movements. The sheep are also familiar with him, understanding his gestures, whistles, and the signals from his pole. At his whistle, they will either line up to graze, scatter like stars across the sky to graze, or stand motionless, awaiting their master's command. He has consistently set high production records for Xinjiang fine-wool sheep for many years and has received multiple awards from the Ministry of Agriculture.

    I was heading towards Abudu Alang's sheepfold when I saw a middle-aged woman in a floral dress, carrying two buckets of water, walking briskly ahead of us. "Jianggan (Sister-in-law)!" Hearing my call, she turned around. A white square headscarf covered her hair, and a smile adorned her rosy face. It turned out to be Abudu Alang's wife, Bubuka. I took the water buckets from her shoulders and placed them on my own, walking and talking with her. As soon as we entered the house, she busied herself brewing milk tea for me.

    Soon, Abudu Alang came in. He was still wearing the winter fur hat with ear flaps. After Bubuka told him the purpose of my visit, he warmly led me into the sheepfold.

    This was a very large sheepfold, divided into sections for ewes with twins, single lambs, month-old lambs, half-month-old lambs, and newborn lambs. Hearing the calls of their mothers from outside, they all stirred and cried out. Some climbed onto the fences, affectionately licking the clothes of Abudu Alang, who stood by the fence.

      "How is the harvest?"

    "Good!" He happily opened his blue notebook, looking at the recorded birth dates of each lamb, mother's number, lamb's weight, etc., and then looked at the lambing tally sheet, saying, "Out of the entire flock of two hundred ewes, one hundred and ninety-three have lambed, with eighty-one single lambs, two hundred and twenty twins, and six lambs are triplets." This is truly a high number!

    However, Abudu Alang was obviously not satisfied with the fact that ewes only give birth once a year. He said that he plans to find a way to have the ewes give birth again within the year, bringing the lambing rate to 300% per year. As he spoke, he opened the twin lamb pens, and the flock of lambs, like children released from school, cried out and joyfully ran towards their mothers, then, wagging their tails, knelt on the grass to nurse.

    Abudu Alang inspected each lamb, carefully observing the emotional changes of each ewe and lamb. I was wholeheartedly looking for the ewe with triplets, wanting to see how one sheep would nurture three lambs. But after searching high and low, I couldn't find a single ewe with triplets. Knowing what I was looking for, Abudu Alang smiled and told me, "It is very difficult for one ewe to raise three lambs well. Therefore, as soon as triplets are born, one of them is taken to a single-lamb ewe with the strongest maternal instinct who gave birth on the same day."

    "The strongest maternal instinct?!" I was surprised.

    "Yes." He calmly explained to me: "Like people, some young ewes are first-time mothers and don't know how to love their children; some favor one of their two children. This requires us to help cultivate the affection between mother and child. However, there are also ewes who, during the pre-birth labor pains, will run over and kiss other lambs. These are the ewes with the strongest maternal instinct, and our triplets are mostly nursed by this type of sheep."

      "However," he said, fearing I wouldn't understand, he continued, "Every ten days, we also have to check the changes in the ewe's milk production. A very few ewes, a few days after giving birth, have milk that is not as rich and the quantity is reduced. At this time, they will dislike the lambs nursing and will shake them off and run away. When this happens, we have to use other methods." After he mentioned this, I realized why Abudu Alang always followed the flock, carefully observing the lambs nursing.

    After the lambs finished nursing, Abudu Alang drove the ewes out to graze. Bubuka immediately came to clean the sheepfold. After she left, an elderly woman with many wrinkles on her face came in. Later, I learned that this was Abudu Alang's widowed sister-in-law, Navati.

    Navati poured warm milk into the baby bottle she held in her hand and began feeding the lambs one by one.

    These six lambs, some because the ewe's milk was too thin to satisfy them, some because the ewe had mastitis, and a pair of lambs whose mother, ewe number 9356, died of an incurable ruptured peritoneum. Before she died, Abudu Alang performed surgery and rescued the lambs from the womb. These lambs can now only be fed artificially.

    Raising a pair of orphaned lambs is the most difficult task for a herdsman. But I discovered that Navati had a special affection for this pair of orphaned lambs. She took them in like a pair of motherless infants, pitying them, caring for them, and holding them in her arms to kiss them. Under Navati's care, these two lambs, only half a month old, have increased their weight to more than ten kilograms and are no different from other lambs born on the same day.

    Navati then turned to another lambing pen and picked up a pair of lambs born last night. These lambs were very small and did not yet know how to nurse. So Navati pried open their mouths with her hands, like administering medicine, and poured it into their bellies. Then she touched their bellies, saying to herself, "Full!" And turned to another pen...

    Leaving Abudu Alang's sheepfold, I felt an indescribable excitement in my heart: how many diligent and good herdsmen like Abudu Alang's family are there on our grasslands! Our sheep will become more and more numerous, as numerous as the white clouds in the sky.

    在阿布都阿郎的羊舍里
    杨克现
    银装素裹的天山雪峰，若断若续地倒映在碧蓝的巩乃斯河里。山上积雪已经开始融化了，山下牧草已经出了嫩绿的芽儿。春天来了！
    春天，对于草原上的牧民来说，是最繁忙的收获的季节。为了去看看牧人的收获景象，我打算去拜访阿布都阿郎。
    阿布都阿郎是一位勤劳朴素的哈萨克贫苦牧民的儿子。自己放羊也有三十多年了。他熟悉羊的性情，能根据羊的目光、叫声和动作，分辨出它们是病了饿了，还是在想念自己的羊羔了；羊也熟悉他懂得他的手势、呼哨和杆子的示意。他一呼哨，它们就会或是排成一字形吃草，或是散成满天星式的吃草，或是站在原地一动也不动，等待主人的命令。他曾经连年创造过新疆细毛羊高产纪录，多次受过农业部的奖励。
    我正朝阿布都阿郎的羊舍走去，只见一个穿着花连衣裙的中年妇女，挑着两桶水，轻快地在我们的前面走着。“江干（嫂子）！”她听见了我的叫声，转过头来。洁白的方布头巾裹着头发，红润的面庞上带着微笑，原来她正是阿布都阿郎的妻子布布卡。我把她的水担抢过来放在自己的肩上，跟她一边谈说着向前走去，一进家门，她就忙着煎奶茶给我喝去了。
    不一会，阿布都阿郎进来了。他仍然戴着冬季用的带有护耳的皮帽。布布卡把我的来意告诉他以后，他便热情地把我引进了羊舍。
    这是一幢很大的羊舍，里面分栏装着双羔、单羔、满月的羊羔、半个月的羊羔和初生的羊羔。它们听见外面母羊的呼唤，全都骚动起来，叫嚷着。有的爬上栏杆，亲切地舐着依栏站立的阿布都阿郎的衣裳。
      “收成怎么样？”
    “不错！”他高兴地打开了蓝色的笔记本，看着上面记载的每一只羔羊出生日期，母亲号码、羔羊体重等，再看了一下产羔累计表说：“全群二百只母羊，有一百九十三只产了羔，单羔八十一只，双羔二百二十只，还有六只羔羊是三羔”。这真是一个很高的数字啊！
    不过阿布都阿郎显然对母羊一年只产一次这点还不满意。他说今年年内准备想法让母羊再产一胎，使羔羊繁殖率一年达到300％。他一边说着，一边打开了那些双羔栏，那成群的羔羊，像放了学的儿童一般，叫嚷着欢腾地奔向自己母亲身边，然后，摇摆着尾巴，跪在草地上吃起奶来。
    阿布都阿郎巡视着每一只羔羊，仔细地观察每只母羊和羔羊的情绪变化。我却一心一意地寻找三羔的母羊，想看一只羊如何哺育三只羔。可是东找西找，一个三羔母羊也找不到。阿布都阿郎知道我的意思后，笑着告诉我：“要一只母羊喂好三只羔是非常困难的。因此，当三羔一生下来，就要把其中一只抱到同天产羔的母性最强的单羔母羊那里去。”
    “母性最强的？！”我感到诧异。
    “是的。”他不慌不忙地向我解释：像人一样，有的年轻的大羊初次作母亲，还不懂得疼孩子；有的对两个孩子偏爱其中的一个。这就需要我们帮助去培养它们母子的感情。但是，也有这样的母羊，在产前阵痛时，它就跑去亲亲别的羔羊。这就是母性最强的大羊，我们的三羔，大都是由这类羊代乳的。”
      “不过，”他深怕我不明白，继续说：“每隔十天还要检查一次母羊产奶量的变化。有极少的母羊，产后不几天，奶汁就不浓了，量也少了。这时它们会厌恶羔羊吃奶，会把羔羊甩掉跑开，遇到这种情况，就得采用别的办法了。”经他这一提，我才明白，为什么阿布都阿郎老跟着羊群，仔细观察羔羊吃奶的原因来。
    给羔羊喂完了奶，阿布都阿郎赶着大羊出外放牧去了。布布卡立刻就来把羊舍打扫得干干净净。她走了以后，又进来了一位面上已有很多皱纹的老年妇女。后来，才知道这是阿布都阿郎的寡嫂娜娃提。
    娜娃提把热温的牛奶装进她手里拿着的奶瓶中，抱着一只一只羔羊喂起奶来。
    这六只羔羊，有的因为大羊奶汁稀吃不饱，有的因为大羊得了乳腺炎，还有一对羔羊，她们的母亲9356号大羊得了不治之症腹膜破裂而死。临死前，阿布都阿郎施行了手术，才把羔羊从胎内救了出来。这些羊羔，现在只能靠人工喂养。
    养活一对孤羔，是牧羊人最困难的事情。但我发现娜娃提对这对孤羔有特殊的感情。她像收下了一对失去母亲的婴儿，可怜它，爱护它，把它搂在怀里亲它。在娜娃提的爱护下这两个出生只有半个月的羔羊，体重已增加到十多公斤，并不比同天生下来的其他羔羊差。
    娜娃提又转向另一个育羔栏栅，抱起了昨夜新生的一对羔羊来。这对羔羊很小，还不懂吃奶哩。于是娜娃提便用手搿开它们的嘴，像灌药一样，灌进它们的肚子。而后摸摸肚皮，自言自语地说：“饱了！”又转向另一个栏栅……
    离开阿布都阿郎的羊舍时，我心里说不出的兴奋：我们的草原上，有多少像阿布都阿郎一家人这样勤恳的好牧人啊！我们的羊会愈来愈多，多得就像天边的白云团似的。
