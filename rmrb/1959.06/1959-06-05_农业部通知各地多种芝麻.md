Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice yesterday, requesting all regions, in addition to firmly grasping the sowing of peanuts, to immediately grasp the sesame sowing work and strive to expand the sesame planting area.

The notice said that because sesame, as a crop, requires a small amount of seeds, has strong adaptability, a short growing period, and high oil content, striving to plant more sesame is of great importance for increasing the production of more oil crops.

    农业部通知各地多种芝麻
    新华社4日讯　农业部昨天发出通知，要求各地除了抓紧花生的播种以外，必须立即抓芝麻的播种工作，力争扩大芝麻的种植面积。
    通知说，由于芝麻这种作物用种量少、适应性强、生长期短、含油量又高，争取多种芝麻，对增产更多的油料有着重要的作用。
