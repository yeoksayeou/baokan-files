Complete the Oilseed Planting Plan

    The winter rapeseed in the southern regions has been harvested, and the spring sowing of oilseed crops such as peanuts, sesame, and sunflowers has basically concluded. Farmers in various regions have already done a lot of work in striving for a bumper oilseed harvest this year. To better complete this year's oilseed production increase plan, people's communes in various regions should advance on this victory and do a faster and better job in the summer sowing of oilseeds.
    Oilseed crops such as peanuts, sesame, and soybeans are suitable for both spring and summer sowing. In many areas of the Yellow River and Huai River basins, they are often cultivated as crops following winter wheat; therefore, the summer sowing area is often larger than the spring sowing area. This situation illustrates that seizing the summer sowing of oilseeds is of great significance for ensuring the realization of the annual oilseed planting plan. This spring, many areas experienced poor spring sowing due to a lack of oilseed seeds and drought. In such areas, the summer sowing period is an excellent opportunity to make up for the insufficient spring sowing area.
    During the summer harvest and summer sowing period, it is necessary not only to make a concentrated effort to harvest a large amount of winter wheat, but also to sow a large amount of coarse grains. The production tasks in terms of food are very large and naturally cannot be relaxed. While grasping grain production, all regions must also tightly grasp the summer sowing of oilseed crops, and this aspect cannot be relaxed either. Whether it is grain crops or oilseed crops, failure to complete the sowing plan for either will similarly bring difficulties to the realization of the annual production increase plan. Although the per-unit yield of peanuts, sesame, and soybeans has been continuously increasing in recent years, the rate of increase has not been large. Given the slow increase in the per-unit yield of these crops, ensuring their planting area is even more important.
    The total area of summer-sown oilseeds has been over tens of millions of mu in past years. This year, due to poor spring sowing of oilseeds in some areas, the summer sowing area will be even larger than in previous years. In the short summer sowing season, and with other agricultural activities being very busy, completing such a large oilseed sowing task requires tapping into various potentials and taking various measures. It is necessary to do a good job in sowing on large areas of land, and also to make full use of scattered land, advancing on both fronts and cooperating with each other, so that the victory will be more assured.
    Mobilizing the masses to plant oilseeds on scattered land is conducive to making full use of commune members' scattered time and semi-labor force, auxiliary labor force, and to fully utilizing the scattered seeds in the hands of commune members. This is a good way to expand the planting area of oilseed crops and increase the total oilseed production at present. Do not look down on it, thinking that it will not expand the area by much. Planting oilseed crops by utilizing gaps appears as scattered spots on a small scale; but on a large scale, gathering many scattered spots together, the area is quite considerable. This year, Kaifeng Prefecture, Henan Province, mobilized the masses to plant oilseed crops on about 70,000 mu of scattered vacant land. From this, it can be seen that there is great potential in planting oilseed crops using scattered land. Can oilseeds produced in a scattered manner be collected? Oilseeds planted by utilizing vacant land are partly intercropped in fields with other crops, or planted on the edges of fields with other crops; oilseed crops planted in this way are generally collectively managed, and there is not much problem in concentrating them. Oilseeds produced individually by commune members are not completely impossible to collect. Not long ago, the Matou Grain Management Station in Jiaocheng County, Hebei Province, adopted the method of visiting villages and purchasing from door to door, and purchased more than 12,900 jin of various oilseeds in six days. As long as the purchasing methods are flexible and the prices are reasonable, a considerable portion of the scattered oilseeds can be concentrated. Even if some of them cannot be concentrated and are eaten by the commune members themselves, what is wrong with that?
    Seed shortage and improper labor allocation were relatively common problems in the spring sowing stage of oilseed crops this year. As a result, many areas were unable to complete the oilseed sowing task according to plan. During the summer sowing stage, the suitable period for sowing is short, there are many agricultural tasks, and the task of summer sowing oilseeds is quite large, so problems such as seeds and labor will still arise. Taking effective measures to solve these problems is an urgent task in leading the summer sowing of oilseed crops. As long as it is regarded as a major matter, the leadership attaches importance to it, and the masses are mobilized to think of ways, these problems can be properly solved. Some of the oilseed crop sowing tasks that were missed during the spring sowing stage can be made up for during the summer sowing period; the sowing tasks that cannot be completed during the summer sowing stage can never be made up for. The suitable time for summer sowing of oilseeds in the Yellow River basin is only about ten days from now; in general, the provinces in the Yangtze River basin should not exceed "Minor Heat" (July 8). A slight delay is a whole year! Hurry up and seize the time, do not delay! (Attached picture)

### 完成油料播种计划

    完成油料播种计划
    南方地区的冬油菜已经收获完了，花生、芝麻、向日葵等油料作物的春播工作已经基本结束。各地农民在争取今年油料大丰收方面已作了不少事情。为了更好地完成今年的油料增产计划，各地各个人民公社应该乘胜前进，把油料夏播工作做得更快更好。
    花生、芝麻、大豆等油料作物，既适宜春种也适宜夏播。在黄河淮河流域的不少地区，它们多是作为冬麦的后作栽培的；因此夏播的面积，往往大于春种的面积。这个情况说明，抓紧油料夏播工作，对于保证全年油料种植计划的实现，是具有重要意义的。今春不少地区由于缺乏油料种子和气候干旱，春播工作进行的不好，在这样的地区，夏种期间更是弥补春播面积不足的大好时机。
    夏收夏种时期，不但要突击收获大量的冬麦，而且要播种大量的杂粮，粮食方面的生产任务是很大的，自然不可放松。各地在抓粮食生产的同时，还必须紧紧抓住油料作物的夏播工作，对这个方面也不可放松。不论粮食作物或者油料作物，哪一种完不成播种计划，都同样会给实现全年的增产计划带来困难。花生、芝麻、大豆的单位产量近几年来虽然不断提高，但是提高的幅度不大。在这些作物单位产量提高较慢的情况下，保证它们的种植面积就显得更加重要了。
    夏播油料的总面积历年都在几千万亩以上。今年由于部分地区春播油料种得不好，夏播面积还会多于往年。在短促的夏种季节里，在别的农事活动都很繁忙的情况下，完成这样大的油料播种任务，必须挖掘多方面的潜力，采取多方面的措施。既要做好大面积土地上的播种工作，也要充分利用零星土地，两路进兵，互相配合，胜利的取得才更有把握。
    发动群众在零星土地上种植油料，便于充分利用社员的零星时间和半劳动力、辅助劳动力，便于充分利用分散在社员手中的零星的种子，是当前扩大油料作物播种面积和增加油料总产量的一个好办法。决不要看不起它，认为这样作扩大不了多大面积。利用隙地种植油料作物，从一个小范围看是星星点点；在大范围内把许许多多的星星点点汇集在一起，面积是颇为不小的。河南开封专区今年发动群众利用零星空地种植的油料作物就有七万亩左右。由此可见，利用零星土地种植油料作物大有可为。零星生产的油料能不能收集起来呢？利用空地种植的油料，一部分是间作在别的作物田里，或者栽种在别的作物田的地边田埂；这样种植的油料作物一般是集体经营的，集中起来不成多大问题。社员个人零星生产的油料，也不是完全收拢不起来的。河北省交河县码头粮管所不久以前采用村村访问、登门收购的办法，在六天里就收购了各种油料一万二千九百多斤。只要收购方法灵活、价格合理，分散的油料也是有不小一部分是可以集中起来的。即使有一部分集中不起来，社员自己吃了，又有什么不好？
    种子不足，劳力调配不当，是今年油料作物春播阶段比较普遍的问题。不少地区因此不能按计划完成油料播种任务。夏种阶段，适宜播种的时期短、农活多，夏播油料的任务又相当大，种子、劳力等问题还会出现。采取有效措施，解决这些问题，是领导油料作物夏播工作中的当务之急。只要把它当成大事，领导方面重视它，发动群众想办法，这些问题是可以得到适当解决的。春播阶段欠下的今年的油料作物播种任务，有些可以在夏种期间弥补；夏种阶段完不成的播种任务，就再也无法弥补了。适宜油料夏种的时间，黄河流域地区，从现在起只有十天左右；长江流域各省一般也不宜越过“小暑”（7月8日）。稍一耽误，就是一年！快快抓紧，切莫迟延！（附图片）
