Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 29th. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which opened here on June 24th, closed today.
　　The plenary session concluded the general discussion today, passed a resolution on the issues discussed, and also adopted the Letter from the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee to all working people of the Soviet Union.
　　The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Khrushchev, spoke at the plenary session today.
　　Since the opening of the plenary session on June 24th, a total of fifty-two people have spoken in the general discussion.
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 29th. Today, "Pravda" said in an editorial entitled "The Great Unity of the Party and the People" that in these days, all Soviet people have been watching the work of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In enterprises, construction sites, collective farms and state farms, and scientific institutions across the country, people are enthusiastically studying the materials of the plenary session.
　　Members of the CPSU Central Committee, Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League workers, scientists, leaders of national economic committees, leaders of enterprises and construction sites, innovative workers, and advanced producers spoke at the plenary session. All speakers unanimously emphasized that the Leninist Central Committee of the Party has carried out tremendous organizational work in implementing the historic resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, and the issues discussed at this plenary session prove this. The plenary session raised some fundamental issues on technological progress, overall mechanization and automation, and further development of the chemical and textile industries, and comprehensively and profoundly discussed the specific tasks of paramount importance for fully展开communist construction and establishing the material and technical foundation of communism.
　　The editorial said that the plenary session sharply criticized such staff: for many years, they have delayed the adoption of new and improved machinery and equipment in production, failed to take into account the achievements of science and technology when designing and constructing enterprises, and sometimes simply ignored the tasks of overall mechanization and automation of production.
　　The editorial continued, the biggest feature of the speeches of all participants in the plenary session is that everyone recognized that the huge and complex tasks put forward by the Party in technological progress, accelerating the development of the chemical industry, and further developing the textile industry can only be realized through the selfless labor of all Soviet people.
　　The editorial pointed out that the Soviet people unanimously support the major measures formulated by the Central Committee of the Party.
　　The editorial concluded that in these memorable days, when the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Party is discussing the major issues of establishing the material and technical foundation of communism, the Soviet people have once again shown that they are united around the Party like a rock, that they are determined to unswervingly implement the historic resolutions of the 21st Party Congress, and that they will faithfully give full play to their strength and work well in order to reach the sacred goal of building communism as soon as possible.

    苏共中央全会胜利闭幕
    就讨论问题通过决议并通过告人民书　赫鲁晓夫在会上发言
    “真理报”指出会议显示党和人民的一致
    本报莫斯科29日专电 6月24日开幕的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议今天在这里闭幕。
    全会今天结束了大会讨论后，就所讨论的问题通过了决议，另外还通过了苏共中央全会告苏联全体劳动人民书。
    苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫在今天的全会上发了言。
    自6月24日全会开幕以来，在大会讨论中发言的共有五十二人。
    新华社莫斯科29日电 今天“真理报”在一篇题为“党和人民的伟大团结一致”的社论中说，在这些日子里，全体苏联人民都瞩望着苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的工作。在全国各地的企业、建筑工地、集体农庄和国营农场以及科学机关中，人们都在热情高涨地研究着全会的材料。
    苏共中央委员、党、苏维埃、工会、共青团的工作人员，科学家，国民经济委员会的领导人，企业和建筑工地的领导人，革新工人，先进生产者都在全会的讲坛上讲了话。所有发言的人都一致强调指出，列宁主义的党中央委员会在贯彻苏共第二十一次代表大会的历史性决议方面进行了巨大的组织工作，这次全会所讨论的问题就证明了这一点。全会就技术进步、全盘机械化和自动化以及进一步发展化学工业和纺织工业提出了一些根本问题，全面地深刻地讨论了对全面展开共产主义建设、对建立共产主义物质技术基础有头等重要意义的具体任务。
    社论说，全会尖锐地批评了这样的工作人员：他们多年来推延在生产中采用新的完善的机器设备，在设计和兴建企业时没有考虑到科学技术的成就，有时干脆无视生产的全盘机械化和自动化的任务。
    社论继续说，所有全会参加者的发言的最大特点就是，大家都认识到了：党在技术进步、加速发展化学工业和进一步发展纺织工业方面所提出的巨大的复杂的任务，只有通过全体苏联人的忘我的劳动才能实现。
    社论指出，苏联人民一致支持党中央委员会拟定的重大措施。
    社论最后说，在这些值得纪念的日子里，当党中央委员会全体会议讨论建立共产主义物质技术基础的重大问题时，苏联人民再一次显示了：他们坚如磐石地团结在党的周围，他们决心不屈不挠地贯彻第二十一次党代表大会的历史性决议，他们要忠心耿耿地充分发挥力量，很好地劳动，以尽速到达建成共产主义这一神圣目标。
