    Kazakh Wedding
    Shen Shi
    On the day when herdsman Hasimu got married, the Party branch secretary of the pastoral cooperative invited me to attend his wedding.
    We rode horses to the pasture deep in the Tianshan Mountains, passing through Mohegou in Gongliu County. The banks of the gully were full of wild apple forests. The horses walked through the forest, and after more than two hours, we still hadn't left the woods.
    Apple blossoms covered the branches, and white and light red petals carpeted the ground. The horses' hooves trampled the fallen flowers, like stepping on a velvet carpet. The rich fragrance of flowers, with gusts of fresh wind, constantly attacked, making people feel drunk. The sounds of birds and bees filled the forest, and in the distance came the call of cuckoos. Hearing cuckoos in the deep mountains felt particularly cordial, and I almost felt like I had returned to my hometown in Jiangnan.
    The Party branch secretary told me that every autumn, a thick layer of apples falls in the forest. There is a farm nearby that drives pigs into the apple forest when the apples are almost ripe. After a few months, the pigs grow fat and fleshy. The Russians living in this area all keep bees. Every time the apple blossoms bloom, they move the beehives around the forest, and they can harvest abundant honey every year. When I was in Mohe, I visited a Manchu farmer who had rich experience in beekeeping. His income from beekeeping supported his entire family. After the establishment of the pastoral cooperative, he continued his old business. The Kirgiz people in the cooperative also followed him to learn beekeeping.
    Wild fruit forests like this are not limited to Mohegou in the Ili River Valley. They naturally form forests, and the fruits grow and die on their own, which is such a pity. I remember that Comrade Wang Enmao of the Autonomous Region Party Committee repeatedly instructed local comrades to gradually improve the wild fruit trees and make full use of wild plants when he inspected Ili. Comrade Enmao's instructions have aroused the attention of local comrades. The rich Xinjiang has inexhaustible wild plants that can be utilized north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, such as the Apocynum venetum growing everywhere in the Tarim River basin, and the Tianshan snow lotus, Lithospermum erythrorhizon, fritillary bulbs, and mushrooms... If they are fully utilized, how much wealth will be added to the country!
    When we reached the mountainside, we caught sight of a large group of horses, hobbled and pacing back and forth in the forest. Not far away, more than a dozen yurts were propped up on the open grassland. These herdsmen living in the flowers can be said to have a special flavor. Many saddles were piled next to the yurts, and several ferocious hunting dogs were chained. Children wearing riding boots chased each other on the grass. Old people sat under the trees, chatting and smoking rough tobacco. Young Kazakh girls, wearing leather hats with eagle feathers inserted in them and dressed in gorgeous dresses, gathered in twos and threes, talking and laughing.
    As we approached the yurts, a group of people hurried to meet us. After being introduced one by one by the Party branch secretary, we were invited into the yurt. The host was very happy to see guests from afar attending the wedding. He poured milk tea while saying to us: "You should have come here a day earlier." It turned out that on the day before the wedding, they took apart the felt around the yurts, and the young men and women attending the wedding sat in the yurts separately and sang to each other, which lasted until late at night. It was a pity that we came late and missed this moving scene.
    When the wedding feast began, we followed the custom of the Kazakh people, first washed our hands, wiped them dry with the towels prepared by the host, and then sat around the carpet according to age. Pastries fried in ghee and fragrant mutton covered with greasy rice were brought in one basin after another. The enthusiastic host smiled and said: "When you come here as a guest, you don't need to be polite!" The Kazakh people are hospitable, and the more enjoyable the guests eat, the happier the host is. After eating the hand-grabbed mutton, a large basin of mare's milk appeared in front of the guests. Speaking of drinking mare's milk, all the Kazakhs present were beaming. They drank one bowl after another. People who drink mare's milk for the first time feel hot all over after drinking it, and it is easy to get drunk if you drink too much.
    After the banquet, "Tegin" was held. "Tegin" is to dig a pit in the ground and put the silver coins or knitted goods sent by the bride in the pit, and pick them up on horseback. One horse followed another, and when approaching the pit, the horses could not stop. Whoever could pick up the gift depended on his skills on horseback.
    After "Tegin", young people rode their horses around the yurt where the bride and groom lived. They shouted: "Young bride! Please take out a sheep and let us snatch the sheep!"
    The bride replied: "Although snatching the sheep is good, we still have to pay attention to saving!"
    The two sides persisted for more than ten minutes, and the guests were unwilling to leave. Finally, the bride's girlfriends came out to relieve the siege. They suggested holding "girl chase" to replace snatching the sheep, and the young men left contentedly.
    We followed this group of young people to the grassland on the high mountain, and "girl chase" began immediately. We saw pairs of young men and women walking side by side slowly. At this time, the young men could talk and joke with the accompanying girls as much as they wanted, and the girls could not refuse. On the way back, the men and women galloped on horseback. If the girl caught up with the boy, she could whip him with a horse whip, and the boy could not resist. When they returned, I saw several young men with horse whip marks on their heads!
    At dusk, we left the pasture. Along the way, the branch secretary talked to us about the newly married couple. I learned that they were both poor herdsmen in the past and are now activists in the cooperative. Before liberation, when Kazakhs got married, the man had to send a very heavy betrothal gift, as many as one hundred and several dozen cattle and sheep, and poor herdsmen could not afford to get married. After the new marriage law was spread to the pastoral areas, the excessive betrothal gifts were abolished, and the lives of the herdsmen have also been greatly improved. People like Hasimu, who could not afford to get married in the past, can now start a family and build a career. I sincerely congratulated him.

    哈萨克人的婚礼
    沈石
    牧民哈斯木结婚的那一天，牧业社的党支部书记约我去参加他的婚礼。
    我们骑马前往天山深处的牧场，途经巩留县的莫合沟，沟的两岸，尽是野生的苹果林。马在林中穿行，过了两个多钟头，还没有走出这片树林。
    苹果花缀满枝头，白色、浅红色的花瓣铺满地面，马蹄践踏着落花，像踩在天鹅绒毡毯上。浓郁的花香，随着阵阵清风，不时地袭来，令人熏熏欲醉。鸟声、蜜蜂声，充满林间，远处还传来杜鹃的啼声。深山闻杜鹃，感到格外亲切，我几疑回到了江南的家乡。
    党支部书记告诉我，每到秋天，树林里落了很厚一层苹果，附近有座农场，当苹果快成熟时，把猪赶进苹果林，几个月后，猪长得膘肥肉厚。住在这一带的俄罗斯人，家家养蜂，每到苹果花开时，他们把蜂箱移到树林周围，每年可割取丰盛的蜂蜜。我在莫合时，曾访问过一位满族农民，他有丰富的养蜂经验，养蜂的收入，维持他全家人的生活。牧业社成立后，他仍操旧业。社里的柯尔克孜人也跟着他学养蜂。
    像这样野生的果林，在伊犁河谷还不止莫合沟一处。它自然地成林，果实自生自灭，说起来多么可惜。记得自治区党委王恩茂同志视察伊犁时，曾再三叮嘱当地的同志要逐步改良野生的果树，要充分利用野生植物。恩茂同志的指示，已经引起当地同志的重视。富饶的新疆，在天山南北可资利用的野生植物真是取之不尽，像塔里木河流域四处丛生的罗布麻，像天山的雪莲、紫草、贝母、蘑菇……，如果充分地加以利用，当为国家增添多少财富！
    我们到了山腰，瞥见一大群马，拴着前蹄，蹒跚地在林中踱来踱去，隔不多远，有十多顶蒙古包撑在空旷的草地上。这些牧民住在花丛中，可说别有一番风味。蒙古包旁边堆着许多马鞍，几只凶猛的猎狗用铁链拴住。孩子们蹬着马靴，在草地上互相追逐。老年人坐在树底下，边谈天，边抽着马合烟。年青的哈萨克姑娘，头戴插有鹰毛的皮帽，身穿华丽的衣裙，三三两两的，聚在一起，有说有笑。
    我们快到蒙古包跟前，一群人赶忙迎上来，经过党支部书记一一介绍后，被邀入蒙古包。主人见有远方的客人来参加婚礼，非常高兴，他一面倒奶茶一面对我们说：“你们要早一天来这里就好了。”原来，在新婚前一天，他们把蒙古包四周的羊毛毡拆去，参加婚礼的青年男女分别坐在蒙古包里，互相唱和，这样要一直唱到深夜。可惜我们来的迟了，没有赶上这个动人的场面。
    新婚喜宴开始的时候，我们遵照哈萨克人的风俗，先洗手，用主人准备的毛巾揩干，然后按照年龄的长幼围坐在地毯上，用酥油炸好的点心，香喷喷的羊肉盖着油腻的米饭，一盆接着一盆递进来。殷勤的主人笑着说：“到这里来作客，就不用客气啦！”哈萨克人是好客的，客人吃得越痛快，主人越高兴。吃罢手抓羊肉，一大盆马奶又出现在客人面前。说起喝马奶，在座的哈萨克人莫不眉飞色舞。他们喝完一碗，又添一碗。初喝马奶的人，喝过后，全身发热，喝的过多，也容易醉人。
    宴会结束，紧接着举行“特银”。“特银”，是在地上挖一个坑，将新娘送的银币或针织品放在坑内，要在马上把它拾起来。马一匹跟着一匹，接近坑时，马不得停留，谁能拾得礼物，就要看他在马上的本领。
    “特银”过后，青年人骑着马把新郎、新娘住的蒙古包团团围住，他们喊着：“年青的新娘呵！请你拿出一只羊来，让我们刁羊吧！”
    新娘答话了：“刁羊虽然好，可是还得注意节约哩！”
    双方坚持了十多分钟，客人不愿散去，最后，新娘的女友出来解围了，她们建议举行“姑娘追”来代替刁羊，小伙子们才满意地离开了。
    我们随着这伙年青人来到了高山上的草原，“姑娘追”紧接着开始了。只见一对对青年男女并辔徐行，这时，小伙子可以尽情地向同行的姑娘谈情逗笑，姑娘不得拒绝。在回来的路上，男女纵马奔驰，假若姑娘追上了小伙子，可以用马鞭抽打，小伙子不得反抗。他们返回时，我见到有几个小伙子的头上挨了马鞭哩！
    黄昏时分，我们才离开牧场。一路上，支部书记向我们谈起了这对新婚夫妇，我才知道他们过去都是穷苦的牧民，现在是社里的积极分子。解放前，哈萨克人结婚，男方要送很厚的聘礼，多的达百几十头牛羊，穷苦的牧民结不起婚。新婚姻法传到牧区，过重的聘礼取消了，牧民的生活也有很大的改善，像哈斯木这些过去结不起婚的人，现在都能成家立业了。我衷心地为他祝贺。
