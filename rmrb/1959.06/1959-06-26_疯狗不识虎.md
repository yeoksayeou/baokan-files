    According to reports from Geneva, after more than a month of negotiations, representatives from the Red Cross Societies of Japan and North Korea reached a preliminary agreement on June 10 regarding the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Upon hearing this news, the hundreds of thousands of Korean residents in Japan who yearn to return to their homeland to participate in socialist construction, as well as the Korean people and progressive world public opinion who are concerned about their fate, were all delighted. This is a preliminary victory in the just struggle of the Korean people. However, the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique, upon hearing this news, went mad. It attacked Japan for "barbaric behavior" and "inhumanity," while clamoring to sever economic and even all other relations with Japan, attempting to "exert pressure" on Japan. It even struck a thug-like pose, shouting that it would "use all means, including force, to prevent Korean residents in Japan from returning to North Korea!"
    For more than a decade, the Syngman Rhee clique, which has sold itself to American imperialism, has turned the beautiful mountains and rivers of southern Korea into a living hell. The economy is bankrupt, and there are cries of woe everywhere. The seven to eight hundred thousand widows and orphans created by the American war of aggression against Korea are destitute, suffering humiliation and harm. Millions of people are struggling on the brink of starvation... The greatest title, "human," has been thoroughly trampled upon in South Korea. An American Lutheran pastor who witnessed the tyranny of the American and Rhee regimes in South Korea could not help but sigh that they had "disgraced all of humanity." However, the Syngman Rhee clique is not satisfied with harming the people within South Korea; it even wants to prevent the hundreds of thousands of Korean residents in Japan from embarking on the path to happiness. The Syngman Rhee clique's attempt to intimidate the just struggle of Korean residents in Japan to return to their homeland is, as a Korean folk saying goes, "A mad dog doesn't recognize a tiger."
    People also see very clearly that the Syngman Rhee clique dares to act so madly and shout wildly because it has the backing of its American masters. After the news of the agreement reached in the Geneva talks was announced, the United States put pressure on Japan, using the beautiful phrase "hoping" that Japan would "respect its promise to support voluntary repatriation" to hint that Japan should make an issue of "voluntary repatriation" to obstruct and postpone the plan to repatriate Korean residents in Japan. At the same time, the American "Ambassador" to South Korea, Dowling, with "greater understanding than ever before," supported the Syngman Rhee clique's approach of threatening Japan with severing trade relations in order to force Japan to abandon the plan to repatriate Korean residents. Precisely because of this, the Syngman Rhee clique's madness is so extreme that it doesn't even put the tiger's might of the Korean people's just struggle in its eyes. However, the "tiger" of the people's struggle is not to be trifled with! Now, hundreds of thousands of Korean residents in Japan are launching a new high tide of struggle, fighting tirelessly to eliminate all obstacles and strive to return to their socialist homeland. Just as the Korean people's desire for peace and national reunification is unshakable, the just struggle of hundreds of thousands of Korean residents in Japan to return to their socialist homeland will never be intimidated by the Syngman Rhee clique's few mad cries.

    “疯狗不识虎”
    丛山
    据来自日内瓦的报道称，朝日两国红十字会代表经过一个多月的谈判，已经在6月10日就遣送旅日朝侨回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的问题达成了初步协议。消息传来，渴望返回祖国参加社会主义建设的几十万旅日朝侨，以及关心他们命运的朝鲜人民和世界进步舆论，都莫不感到快慰。这是朝鲜人民正义斗争的一个初步胜利。但是，朝鲜民族的败类李承晚集团，听到这个消息后却发了疯，它一面攻击日本“野蛮行为”“不人道”，一面叫嚷要同日本断绝经济甚至其他一切关系，想对日本“施加压力”。它甚至还摆出一副打手的架势，大喊大叫说“要用一切手段阻止旅日朝侨返回北朝鲜，包括使用武力在内”（！）
    十几年来，卖身投靠美帝国主义的李承晚集团，已经把朝鲜南部的大好山河变成人间地狱，经济破产，哀鸿遍野，美国侵朝战争造成的七、八十万寡妇和孤儿，无依无靠，备受侮辱和损害，千百万人民辗转在饥饿线上……。“人”，这个最伟大的称号，在南朝鲜已经被糟蹋得够了。在美国的一个路德教派的牧师目睹美李暴政下的南朝鲜，都不禁感喟地说它们“丢尽了全人类的脸”。但是，李承晚集团还不以残害南朝鲜境内的人民为满足，竟然想阻止走向幸福之路的几十万旅日朝侨。李承晚集团妄想，恐吓旅日朝侨返回祖国的正义斗争，正如朝鲜民间的一句俗语所说：“疯狗不识虎”。
    人们也看得很清楚：李承晚集团所以敢于如此地发疯，敢于狂叫，背后有美国主子在撑腰。在日内瓦会谈达成协议的消息发表后，美国便向日本施加压力，以“希望”日本“尊重它表示支持自愿遣返的诺言”这句漂亮词句，暗示要日本在“自愿遣返”上作文章，阻挠和搁置遣送旅日朝侨的计划。与此同时，美国驻南朝鲜“大使”陶林又以“比过去任何时候都大的了解”，支持李承晚集团以断绝同日本的贸易关系来威胁日本放弃遣返朝侨计划的作法。正是因为这样，李承晚集团这股疯狂劲儿，简直连朝鲜人民的正义斗争的虎威都不放在眼内了。但是，人民斗争之“虎”岂是好惹的！现在，几十万旅日朝侨，正在掀起新的斗争高潮，为排除一切阻力、争取返回社会主义祖国而战斗不懈。正如朝鲜人民渴望和平和祖国统一的意志不可动摇一样，几十万旅日朝侨争取返回社会主义祖国的正义斗争，决不是李承晚集团的几声狂叫就可以吓倒的。
