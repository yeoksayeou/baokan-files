	"The Peacock That Flew From Afar"
	By Our Correspondents Su Hua and Huang Changlu

	The home of the peacock is on the banks of the Ruili River, close to Burma. In the hearts of the local Dai people, the peacock symbolizes beauty, light, and auspiciousness. Lieutenant Yang Qingsuo, however, is praised as "the peacock that flew from afar."

	Yang Qingsuo is the leader of the ethnic work team sent by the border troops to Hesai Township, Ruili County. In the spring of 1955, the work team came to Hesai Township, where democratic reforms had not yet been carried out. The Tusi and landlords forced the peasants to bear more than eighty kinds of taxes and corvée labor. Although the Ruili Dam is a pearl on the frontier, the lives of the Dai people were very poor. Yang Qingsuo felt sad when he saw this situation, which gave him a strong desire: "I want to dedicate my strength to this nation and help them achieve happiness!"

	During the rainy season of that year, there was a flash flood, and the water in the Nanbo River surged, with the flood carrying mud and sand, breaching the river embankment. Nearly three hundred mu of rice fields about to be harvested were about to be flooded. Under the leadership of the work team, the masses braved the rain to rush to the embankment. Yang Qingsuo was the first to jump into the water to plug the gap. The raging flood swept him two hundred meters away. He stubbornly climbed ashore and jumped in again to plug the gap. This courageous action inspired and motivated the masses to go into the water one after another. After fighting for more than five hours, they finally blocked the river embankment and saved the rice. However, Yang Qingsuo's body was covered with countless wounds from thorn bushes, bamboo tips, and Asia cyperus. He fell ill in bed, and the masses from all the villages in the township brought eggs and other things to visit him. Several old women even moved their quilts and lived by Yang Qingsuo's side, guarding him day and night like taking care of their son.

	In this way, the work team gained the trust of the Dai people. They then led and helped the Dai people of the entire township to complete the land reform, overturned the feudal lord system that had been oppressing the Dai people for hundreds of years, and established the first agricultural production cooperative in the county. According to the instructions of the county party committee, the work team mobilized cooperative members to accumulate fertilizer in order to ensure increased agricultural production. However, the Dai people had never had the habit of accumulating fertilizer for generations. When the elderly heard that they had to accumulate fertilizer, they spat and walked away. When the young men and women heard that they had to pick up manure, they were too ashamed to lower their heads. Some people said: "If manure is applied to the fields, the rice will stink."

	The situation was difficult, but Yang Qingsuo did not lose heart. He and the secretary of the township party branch first carried manure baskets to the village to pick up cow dung and cow bones. One day, two days, three days passed. The Dai people saw that the two people they loved most were not afraid of getting dirty, and they were ashamed and moved, and one by one they joined the ranks of accumulating fertilizer.

	The face of Hesai Township is changing rapidly. Batch after batch of Dai people joined the cooperative. The cooperative has increased production year after year. Every family has built toilets, livestock are kept in barns, every township has primary schools, and every village has night schools. Just as the Dai people were beginning to get rid of poverty and embark on a happy life, the border troops decided to demobilize Yang Qingsuo. When the masses heard about it, they rushed to the township government to surround him, kept his luggage, and cried incessantly. The villagers sent representatives to the district party committee, the county party committee, and the leading organs of the border troops to request: "Don't transfer Lao Yang away, we want him!" The enthusiastic Dai people not only desperately kept Yang Qingsuo, but also helped him settle down on the border.

    “远方飞来的孔雀”
    本报记者　苏华　黄昌禄
    在紧靠缅甸的瑞丽江边，是孔雀的家乡。孔雀，在当地傣族的心目中象征着美丽、光明和吉祥，少尉杨庆锁，却被人誉为“远方飞来的孔雀”。
    杨庆锁是边防部队派驻瑞丽县贺赛乡的民族工作组组长。1955年春，工作组来到贺赛乡，这里还没有进行民主改革，土司和地主强迫农民负担的赋税、徭役还有八十多种。虽然瑞丽坝是边地一颗珍珠，但傣族人民的生活却很贫困。杨庆锁看到这种情形，心里就难受，使他产生了强烈的愿望：“要把自己的力量献给这个民族，帮助他们获得幸福！”
    这年雨季里，有一次山洪暴发，南波河的水猛涨了，洪水挟着泥沙，冲破了河堤，眼看近三百亩收获在望的谷子就要被洪水淹没。群众在工作组带领下冒雨赶到堤岸，杨庆锁第一个跳下水去堵缺口，汹涌的洪水把他冲了二百多公尺远，他顽强地爬上岸来，又跳下去堵。这种勇敢行动鼓舞和带动了群众纷纷下水，一直搏斗了五个多小时，终于把河堤堵好，挽救了稻谷。可是杨庆锁浑身已被刺丛、竹尖和亚赛草划了无数条伤口。他病倒在床上，全乡各寨的群众纷纷带着鸡蛋等来探望他，有几个老大妈还搬了被子住在杨庆锁身边，像照顾儿子一样白天黑夜都守护着他。
    就这样，工作组取得了傣族群众的信任。他们接着领导和帮助全乡傣族人民完成了土地改革，掀倒了压在傣族人民头上几百年的封建领主制度，并建立了全县第一个农业生产合作社。工作组根据县委指示，发动社员积肥，以保证农业增产。可是傣族人民祖祖辈辈从来没有积肥的习惯，老年人听说要积肥，吐着唾沫走开了，小伙子和姑娘们听说要捡大粪，羞得低下了头。有些人说：“田里上了粪，谷子都会臭。”
    事情很困难，但杨庆锁并不灰心。他和乡的党支部书记首先提着粪筐到寨子里去拾牛粪和牛骨头，一天、两天、三天过去了，傣族人看见他们最爱戴的两个人都不怕脏，又惭愧，又感动，一个个地都加入了积肥的行列。
    贺赛乡的面貌在迅速地改变着。一批又一批的傣族人加入了合作社，社里连年增产，家家盖起厕所，牲畜关进了厩，乡乡有小学，寨寨有夜校。正当傣族人民开始摆脱贫困踏上幸福生活的时候，边防部队决定让杨庆锁复员，群众听说了，赶快跑到乡政府来把他围住，留住他的行李，大哭不止。乡亲们派代表向区委、县委和边防部队领导机关请求：“不要把老杨调走，我们要他！”热心的傣族人不但苦苦留住了杨庆锁，还帮助他在边疆安了家。
