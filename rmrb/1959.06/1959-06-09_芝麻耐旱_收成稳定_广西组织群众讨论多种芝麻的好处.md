Sesame is Drought-Resistant and Yields Stable Harvests
Guangxi Organizes Masses to Discuss the Benefits of Planting More Sesame

According to the Guangxi Daily, Guangxi is currently sowing sesame seeds in various locations. As of May 23, over 121,000 mu have been sown throughout the region. The Nanning Prefecture has made faster progress, having sown more than 67,000 mu, accounting for 38.3% of the prefecture's planting plan. In the process of planting sesame, various places have paid attention to publicizing the significance of increasing oilseed production to the masses, the favorable conditions and benefits of planting sesame. Before sowing, many counties and communes also carried out a series of ideological work, reversing the reluctance of cadres and the masses to plant sesame through detailed calculations, so that the planting tasks were quickly implemented. For example, in the Fucheng Commune of Wuming, after debate, everyone unanimously agreed that expanding sesame planting could make up for the insufficient peanut planting tasks. They also recognized that planting sesame had five major benefits: it requires less labor and investment, but generates large income, requiring only 10 to 12 liang of seeds and six workdays per mu, and generally yielding 70 to 100 jin, worth 17 to 24 yuan; intercropping sesame in corn fields does not affect corn production; sesame is drought-resistant and yields a stable harvest; sesame produces a lot of oil, with 100 jin of seeds yielding more than 45 jin of oil, and the taste is good; sesame leaves can fertilize the land. This strengthened everyone's confidence in completing the planting tasks, expanding the commune's planting area from the original plan of 5,000 mu to 6,500 mu. In the process of expansion, when encountering difficulties due to insufficient land, everyone explored the potential of the land, reclaiming virgin and fallow land, and implementing intercropping.

In the process of planting sesame, various places also paid attention to improving farming techniques, implementing intensive cultivation and fine farming, striving for higher yields.

    芝麻耐旱　收成稳定
    广西组织群众讨论多种芝麻的好处
    据广西日报报道　广西各地正在播种芝麻。到5月23日统计，全区已播下十二万一千多亩。南宁专区进度较快，已播下六万七千多亩，占专区种植计划38.3％。在种植芝麻中，各地都注意了对群众宣传增产油料的意义，种植芝麻的有利条件和好处，不少县和公社还在播种之前，进行了一系列的思想工作，通过算细账扭转干部、群众不愿种芝麻的思想，使种植任务很快落实。如武鸣府城公社各大队，通过辩论，大家一致认为扩种芝麻可以弥补花生种植任务的不足，并且认识到种芝麻有五大好处：费工少，投资也少，收入大，每亩只需十至十二两种子和六个工，一般可收七十至一百斤，价值十七至二十四元；在玉米地间种芝麻不影响玉米增产；芝麻耐旱，收成稳当；芝麻出油多，一百斤籽能榨出油四十五斤以上，味道又好；芝麻叶子能肥沃土地。这就坚定了大家完成种植任务的信心，使全公社由原计划种五千亩扩大到六千五百亩。各地在扩种当中，遇到土地不足的困难，大家便挖土地潜力，开垦生、熟荒地，实行间种。
    在种植芝麻中，各地还注意了改进耕作技术，实行精耕细作，争取多收。
