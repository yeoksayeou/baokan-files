This dispatch from Hangzhou, June 22nd: The production of poultry and livestock in Zhejiang Province has rapidly recovered and increased the number of livestock and poultry.

By the end of May, the province had developed more than 21 million chickens, ducks, and geese, more than double the number at the end of 1958. The province's five million farm households averaged nearly four poultry each. Xianju County, which developed rapidly, averaged more than ten each. Qu County raised approximately three times more poultry than at the end of 1958, averaging 8.8 each. In many communes and production teams, chickens filled the villages, ducks and geese filled the ponds, and each household raised dozens. One team in the Yongxing Brigade of the Zhongdai Commune in Pinghu County averaged 76 each.

The number of pigs, cattle, and sheep raised throughout the province is also rapidly increasing. At the end of May, the number of live pigs in the province increased by 282,700 compared to the end of February, and by 127,500 compared to the end of April. In more than fifty counties and cities in the province, thirty-six saw a significant increase in pig breeding compared to the end of April. Shaoxing, Tonglu, Qu County, and Hangzhou and other counties and cities increased by more than 20,000 in one month. Rapidly developing areas, such as the Xihu Production Team of the Xihu Commune in Hangzhou, averaged 8.1 pigs per household and 2.2 pigs per mu of cultivated land. The number of sheep and goats raised throughout the province also increased by more than 130,000 compared to the end of 1958, and the number of domestic rabbits raised increased from more than 1,060,000 at the end of 1958 to more than 2,760,000, an increase of more than one and a half times.

The rapid development of poultry and livestock production in Zhejiang Province is mainly due to the strengthening of leadership by Party committees at all levels throughout the province, the widespread publicity of the significance of developing poultry and livestock production, and the clarification of policies. At the same time, the Party committees of prefectures, counties, and communes throughout the province have established leading groups and offices for poultry and livestock production, with a secretary or standing committee member specifically in charge of this work, which has played a decisive role in timely solving various specific problems.

    人人动手　户户饲养　猪羊满栏　鸡鸭成群
    浙江大量增养家畜家禽
    全省五百万农户平均每户养家禽四只
    生猪比二月份增加二十八万二千多头
    本报杭州22电　浙江省家禽家畜的生产，迅速恢复了和增加了家畜家禽的数量。
    到5月底，全省鸡鸭鹅已发展到二千一百多万只，比1958年底增加了一倍以上，全省五百多万农户，平均每户饲养家禽近四只；发展较快的仙居县平均每户饲养十多只；衢县饲养家禽比1958年底增长三倍左右，平均每户八点八只。许多公社、生产队毛鸡满村庄，鸭鹅满池塘，平均每户养了几十只。平湖县钟埭公社永兴大队一小队，平均每户养了七十六只。
    全省猪牛羊饲养数量也在迅速增加。5月底全省生猪存栏数比2月底增加了二十八万二千七百头，比4月底增加了十二万七千五百头，全省五十多个县市有三十六个县市生猪饲养数量比4月底有了显著增加。绍兴、桐庐、衢县和杭州等县市，一个月内都增养两万头以上。发展快的如杭州市西湖公社西湖生产队，每户平均养猪八点一头，每亩耕地平均有猪二点二头。全省绵羊、山羊饲养量也比1958年底增加十三万多头，家兔饲养量也由1958年底的一百零六万多只增加到二百七十六万多只，增长一倍半以上。
    浙江省家禽家畜生产所以发展迅速，主要原因是全省各级党委加强了领导，广泛地宣传了发展家禽家畜生产的意义，并交代了政策。同时，全省各地委、县委和公社党委都建立了家畜家禽生产领导小组和办公机构，由一个书记或常委专管这一工作，对及时解决各项具体问题起了决定性的作用。
