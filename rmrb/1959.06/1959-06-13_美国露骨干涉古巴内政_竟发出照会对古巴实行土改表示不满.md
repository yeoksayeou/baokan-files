Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 12th: The United States government formally presented a note to the Cuban government on the 11th, openly interfering in Cuba's internal affairs and expressing "serious concern" about Cuba's land reform law. The note was released in Washington on the 11th. On the same day, the United States Ambassador to Cuba, Bonsal, handed the aforementioned note to the Cuban Foreign Minister, Agromonte, in Havana.

The note had to admit that, according to international law, the Cuban government has the right to confiscate or expropriate foreign property, but at the same time expressed "regret" that the Cuban government "did not seek to hear the opinions of American investors in Cuba" when formulating the land reform law. The note also unreasonably demanded that the Cuban government "further exchange views" with the United States on the consequences that the land reform law would cause. At the same time, the note completely disregarded the fact that the Cuban government has the right to determine the compensation period for confiscated land, and demanded that the Cuban government give American landowners in Cuba "prompt, appropriate, and effective compensation." The note also disregarded the fact that American monopoly capitalists plunder huge profits from Cuba every year, nonsensically claiming that American investment "has contributed to Cuba's economy and has always complied with Cuban laws."

Although this note used some deceptive phrases, saying that the United States government "understands and sympathizes" with the goals that the Cuban government wants to achieve through land reform, etc., it cannot hide the fact that the United States is nakedly interfering in Cuba's internal affairs. In fact, from the first day Cuba announced the land reform law, the American bosses were furious, threatening to reduce the quota of Cuban sugar imports, and the American reactionary newspapers openly promoted armed intervention in Cuba and advocated for another "Guatemalan incident" like in 1954. At that time, the United States provided a large amount of military aid to Guatemalan reactionary officers who had fled abroad, launched an armed attack, and overthrew the democratic government of Guatemala.

    美国露骨干涉古巴内政
    竟发出照会对古巴实行土改表示不满
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府11日向古巴政府正式提出照会，公开干涉古巴内政，对古巴的土地改革法表示“严重关切”。这份照会是11日在华盛顿公布的。同一天，美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔在哈瓦那把上述照会交给了古巴外交部长阿格拉蒙特。
    这份照会不得不承认，根据国际法，古巴政府有权没收或征用外国的财产，但同时却对古巴政府在制定土地改革法时“没有设法听取美国在古巴的投资人的意见”一点表示“遗憾”。照会并且无理地要求古巴政府就土地改革法将引起的后果同美国“进一步交换意见”。同时，照会完全无视古巴政府有权确定对被没收土地的补偿年限这样一个事实，竟要求古巴政府给美国在古巴的土地所有者以“及时的、恰如其分的和有效的补偿”。这份照会还不顾美国垄断资本家每年从古巴掠走巨额利润的事实，胡说什么美国的投资“对古巴的经济有过贡献，并且一向遵守古巴的法律”。
    尽管这份照会使用了一些骗人的辞句，说什么美国政府“了解并同情”古巴政府通过土地改革所要达到的目标等等，但是它并不能掩盖美国赤裸裸地干涉古巴内政这个事实。实际上从古巴公布土地改革法的第一天起，美国大老板们就暴跳如雷，威胁要降低古巴蔗糖进口的定额，美国反动报纸公然宣传要武装干涉古巴，并鼓吹再来一次1954年的“危地马拉事件”。当时美国以大量军火援助逃亡在外的危地马拉反动军官，发动武装进攻，推翻了危地马拉的民主政府。
