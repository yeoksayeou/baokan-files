    重视适合民族习惯的药品生产
    内蒙古积极发展医药工业
    新华社呼和浩特11日电　内蒙古自治区积极发展医药工业。最近建成并投入生产的有呼和浩特制药厂、乌兰浩特中蒙药加工厂、大兴安岭中西医制药厂等。原来不能生产针剂的哲里木盟，现在正在加紧建设一座规模较大的制药厂，准备在今年内生产针剂一千万支，中医成药品种也将由三百四十种增加到一千种。呼伦贝尔盟医药药材公司也在积极兴办医药工业，年内将生产西药一百二十种。
    各地对适合民族生活习惯的中蒙医药品的生产非常重视。昭乌达盟巴林右旗民族制药厂除了制造一般西药、丸药以外，还特别为蒙古族牧民生产二十种蒙药。这个厂所有药品的说明书，都用蒙汉两种文字，很受牧民欢迎。
    内蒙古各地农村人民公社在当地医药部门的协助下，正在种植各种药材和上山采集野生药材。今年全自治区除了种植小茴香、甘草、红花等药材五万亩以外，还要收购野生药材两亿斤。
