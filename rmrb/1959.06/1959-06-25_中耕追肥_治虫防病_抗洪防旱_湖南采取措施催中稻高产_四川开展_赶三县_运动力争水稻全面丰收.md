　　Hunan Takes Measures to Promote High Yields of Mid-Season Rice
　　Sichuan Launches "Catch Up with the Three Counties" Campaign to Strive for Overall Bumper Harvest of Rice

　　This newspaper Changsha, June 24th. Hunan's rice seedlings are growing very well. Early rice has begun to head, and mid-season rice has entered the peak period of tillering. While strengthening the late-stage management of early rice, various regions are also cultivating and topdressing mid-season rice, vigorously attacking the tillering stage of mid-season rice. Currently, about 80% of the province's mid-season rice has been cultivated and topdressed once or more.

　　Hunan Province will plant nearly 20 million mu of mid-season rice this year, an increase of more than 2 million mu over the original plan. The area of mid-season rice accounts for more than half of the province's total rice planting area. Historically, its yield has been higher than that of early rice and even higher than that of late rice. A good harvest of mid-season rice can surpass the harvests of both early and late rice combined. Therefore, striving for a bumper harvest of mid-season rice is of great significance for ensuring that Hunan Province fulfills its grain production increase plan. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all regions to seize the opportunity, increase efforts and measures, vigorously attack the tillering stage of mid-season rice, leaving no stone unturned and no field neglected, and launch a comprehensive upgrading campaign for mid-season rice seedlings.

　　In the vigorous attack on the tillering stage of mid-season rice, various regions, by summarizing last year's high-yield experience and according to the growth characteristics of this year's mid-season rice, are firmly grasping the three key links of cultivation and topdressing, pest and disease control, and flood and drought resistance. In cultivation and topdressing, Hunan has generally adopted the method of grasping the laggards, catching up with the advanced, and driving the middle, organizing professional teams to focus on the third-class seedlings in remote areas, so that the seedlings can be fully upgraded. In Fenghuang County, a mountainous area in western Hunan, the first secretary of the county party committee took the lead in organizing professional groups of more than 30,000 people to topdress the third-class seedlings in scattered fields and mountain drylands. After a week, more than 40,000 mu of the county's 60,000 mu of third-class seedlings were upgraded.

　　Currently, pests such as rice planthoppers and rice stem borers have begun to appear, and various regions have also promptly launched a struggle to prevent and control diseases and insect pests. In early June, the Chen County Special District mobilized more than 820,000 people, used 300,000 pieces of insecticide equipment, and adopted the methods of striking first, comprehensively encircling and suppressing, attacking fiercely and decisively, and fighting a quick battle to basically eliminate the initial diseases and insect pests of early and mid-season rice in nine days.

　　Since the water conservancy conditions of some mid-season rice fields are not as good as those of early rice fields, various regions, while fighting against mountain flood attacks, have paid special attention to storing and managing water, implementing dedicated personnel to watch over the water, irrigating shallowly and frequently, and ensuring a steady flow of water to ensure a bumper harvest of mid-season rice.

　　This newspaper Chengdu, June 24th. Sichuan's rural areas have widely launched the "Catch Up with the Three Counties" campaign, their slogan being: "In high-yield rice production, learn from Pixian County in the Chengdu Plain; in double-cropping rice yield increase, learn from Fushun County in the hilly areas; in high-yield mid-season rice, learn from Mabian County in the mountainous areas."

　　These three counties, due to their comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, created excellent achievements in large-area high yields of mid-season rice and double-cropping rice last year, and became the banners of rice production in the province's plains, hills, and mountains respectively. After the experiences of the three counties were recently published in the newspapers, a "Catch Up with the Three Counties" upsurge, centered on strengthening field management, has been launched by the broad masses of rural cadres and peasants, striving for large-area high yields of rice throughout the province.

　　At present, the transplanting of more than 40 million mu of rice in Sichuan Province has basically ended, of which more than 4 million mu of early rice have already rooted and closed rows. In the earlier season areas of southern Sichuan, early rice is budding and heading. This is a critical period for achieving high rice yields. Local party committees have all compared themselves with the three counties based on local conditions and formulated specific measures for "Catching Up with the Three Counties." Lushan County and Mabian County have roughly the same natural conditions. After learning from Mabian County's experience, they have broken down the theory of determinism of conditions, established a high-yield ideology, and decided to fully establish a "Three-to-the-Field" field management responsibility system, that is, managers go to the field, technical measures go to the field, and targets go to the field, striving for an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu of mid-season rice in the county. After completing the sowing plan for expanding late rice by 180,000 mu, Yibin County immediately established a dedicated responsibility management system for seedling fields, stepping up the cultivation of strong seedlings to ensure that transplanting begins in early July.

　　In the "Catch Up with the Three Counties" campaign, all regions have paid special attention to the three counties' experience in applying sufficient base fertilizer and rationally topdressing in stages according to the different growth stages of rice, such as greening, jointing, and heading. People's communes in Nanchong Special District are supplementing base fertilizer to some mid-season rice fields that lack sufficient base fertilizer. A million-strong labor force in Yibin Special District is vigorously attacking the heading and topdressing of early rice and striving to complete the second cultivation and topdressing ahead of schedule.

　　In addition to stepping up the replanting of seedlings and weeding, all regions have paid special attention to learning from the three counties' experience in preventing rice lodging. Wenjiang Special District is comprehensively promoting shallow water irrigation and drainage for sun-drying the fields to control the rampant growth of rice leaves and promote the robustness of the basal tillers. Pengshui County has also adopted methods such as applying grass ash fertilizer and earthing up the roots of seedlings to prevent rice lodging.

　　With the development of the "Catch Up with the Three Counties" campaign, Sichuan has listed field management work as the front line of agricultural production, and more than half of the labor force has been transferred to this area. Many county party committee secretaries and people's commune party committee secretaries have taken the lead and gone to the fields to work, personally leading the management work. (Li Shaozhong)

    中耕追肥　治虫防病　抗洪防旱
    湖南采取措施催中稻高产
    四川开展“赶三县”运动力争水稻全面丰收
    本报长沙24日电　湖南的禾苗生长很好，早稻开始抽穗，中稻进入分蘖盛期。各地正在加强早稻后期管理的同时，给中稻中耕追肥，猛攻中稻分蘖关。目前，全省约有80％的中稻已中耕追肥一次以上。
    湖南省今年种植中稻将近二千万亩，比原计划扩大了二百来万亩。中稻面积约占全省水稻种植面积一半以上，历来产量比早稻高、比晚稻更高；较好的中稻，一季收成可以赛过早、晚稻两季收成。因此，争取中稻丰收，对保证湖南省完成粮食增产计划有很大的意义。中共湖南省委要求各地抓住时机，加干劲、加措施，猛攻中稻分蘖关，一着不让，一丘不放，开展中稻禾苗全面升级运动。
    在猛攻中稻分蘖关中，各地通过总结去年丰产经验和根据今年中稻生长的特点，狠狠地抓住中耕追肥，治虫防病，抗洪防旱等三个环节。在中耕追肥中，湖南各地一般采取抓落后、赶先进、带动中间的办法，组织专业队，突击边远地区的三类禾苗，使禾苗全面升级。湘西山区的凤凰县，县委第一书记挂帅，组织了三万多人参加的专业小组，给零散田、山旱田里的三类禾苗追肥。一周之后，全县六万多亩三类苗有四万多亩便升了级。
    现在，稻飞虱、稻螟虫等虫害已经露头，各地也及时开展了防治病虫害的斗争。郴县专区在6月初出动八十二万多人，使用三十万件杀虫药械，采取先发制敌，全面围剿，猛攻猛打，速战速决的办法，九天基本上扑灭了早、中稻初生病虫害。
    由于有些中稻田的水利条件不如早稻田好，各地在战胜山洪袭击的同时，特别注意了蓄水管水，实行专人看水、浅灌勤灌，细水长流，确保中稻丰收。　（胡坚）
    本报成都24日电　四川农村广泛开展了“赶三县”运动，他们的口号是：“水稻高额丰产向川西平原郫县看齐，双季稻增产向丘陵地区富顺县看齐，中稻高产向山区马边县看齐”。
    这三个县由于全面贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，去年创造了中稻和双季稻大面积高产的优异成绩，分别成为全省平原、丘陵和山区水稻生产的旗帜。三县的经验最近在报纸上公布以后，广大农村干部和农民群众即掀起了以加强田间管理为中心的“赶三县”热潮，力争全省水稻大面积高产。
    目前，四川省四千多万亩水稻栽插基本结束，其中四百多万亩早稻已发蔸封行，季节较早的川南地区，早稻正在含苞孕穗。这正是夺取水稻高产的关键时期。各地党委都分别根据当地的具体条件，同三县作了比较，制订出各自“赶三县”的具体措施。芦山县和马边县自然条件大体相同，他们在学习了马边县的经验之后，破除唯条件论，树立了高产思想，决定全面建立“三到田”的田间管理责任制，即管理人到田，技术措施到田，指标到田，力争全县中稻平均亩产达到一千斤。宜宾县在完成扩大十八万亩晚稻的播种计划之后，立即建立了秧田专人责任管理制，加紧培育壮秧，保证7月初开始栽插。
    在“赶三县”运动中，各地都特别注意三县在重施底肥和按水稻转青、拔节、孕穗等不同生长阶段，分期合理追肥的经验。南充专区各地人民公社正给部分底肥不足的中稻田补施底肥。宜宾专区百万劳动大军，正大力猛攻早稻的孕穗追肥，并争取提早完成二次中耕追肥。
    各地除了加紧补苗、薅秧外，特别注意学习三县防止水稻倒伏的经验。温江专区正在全面推广浅水灌溉、排水晒田的方法，控制稻叶疯长，促使基秠健壮。彭水县还采用了追施草木灰肥料和给秧根培土等办法，防止水稻倒伏。
    随着“赶三县”运动的开展，四川各地已把田间管理工作列为农业生产上的第一线，有半数以上的劳动力已经转移到这方面来。许多县委和人民公社党委的书记都挂帅上阵，到田间办公，亲自领导管理工作。
