From Chengdu, June 3rd: Xin Fan County on the West Sichuan Plain has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of its 73,000 mu of rapeseed, which has all been harvested and threshed. According to the level-by-level reporting statistics after actual measurement and collection, a total of more than 10,970,000 jin of rapeseed were harvested, with an average yield of 150 jin and 3 liang per mu, an increase of 63% compared to last year's 92 jin per mu. Among them, 20,000 mu of Victory Rapeseed had an average yield of 180 jin and 7 liang per mu, an increase of 96% compared to last year. The first production team of the fourth management district of Qingbai Commune harvested 326 and a half jin per mu on average from its 260 mu of rapeseed, more than double the average yield of the county. The first management district of this commune had a 1.21 mu cadre-commanded field, which harvested a total of 660 jin and 5 liang of rapeseed, an average yield of 546 jin per mu.

The main reason for the high yield of rapeseed in Xin Fan County is the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase. All rapeseed fields were deeply ploughed, generally more than one chi deep, and some high-yield fields and commanded fields were ploughed about two chi deep. Base fertilizer was applied in layers during deep ploughing, with more than 50,000 jin of water manure equivalent applied per mu. Improved varieties of Victory Rapeseed and local Big Horn Yellow Rapeseed were used. Reasonable close planting was further promoted, field management was strengthened, and pests and diseases were prevented and controlled in a timely manner.

This year, the Xin Fan County Party Committee and the commune's leadership at all levels launched a mass high-yield campaign throughout the county. From the county party committee, the commune, the management district to the production team, from cadres to the masses, all planted high-yield rapeseed fields, driving a large-scale high-yield movement. The commanding fields of leaders at all levels have become a driving force for promoting a bumper harvest of summer crops. All communes universally established field management professional teams, strengthened responsibilities, and implemented contracted responsibility by area. Communes, management districts, and production teams regularly conducted inspections, appraisals, and competitions to compete for the red banner of excellence. The crops were inspected and appraised, ranked separately, and problems were identified, and measures were increased in a timely manner to continuously eliminate backward seedlings.

The bumper harvest of rapeseed has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. Before the summer harvest has ended, a tense high tide of spring production has rapidly formed throughout the county, and a comprehensive high-efficiency, over-quota movement has quickly been launched. At present, more than 80% of the 200,000 mu of rice has been planted, and the early rice has generally been cultivated and top-dressed once or twice.

    新繁县初传大面积丰收喜讯
    七万亩油菜亩产一百五十斤
    本报成都3日电　川西平原上的新繁县，今年播种的七万三千亩油菜，已经全部收割脱粒完毕，获得大面积丰收。根据实打实收后的逐级上报统计，共收菜籽一千零九十七万多斤，平均亩产一百五十斤三两，比去年亩产九十二斤增加63％。其中两万亩胜利油菜，平均亩产一百八十斤七两，比去年增加96％。青白公社第四管理区第一生产队的二百六十亩油菜，平均亩产三百二十六斤半，比全县平均产量多一倍多。这个公社第一管理区有一亩二分一厘干部指挥田，共收菜籽六百六十斤五两，平均亩产五百四十六斤。
    新繁县油菜高产的主要原因是认真贯彻了农业增产的“八字宪法”。所有的油菜田都进行了深耕，一般都深耕一尺以上，部分丰产田和指挥田深耕二尺左右。深耕时分层施了底肥，每亩施底肥折合水粪在五万斤以上。采用了胜利油菜和本地大角角黄油菜良种。进一步推行了合理密植，加强了田间经营管理，及时防治了病虫害。
    今年，新繁县委和公社的各级领导机构，在全县范围内开展了群众性的高产运动，从县委、公社、管理区到生产队，从干部到群众，都种了油菜丰产田，带动了大面积丰产运动。各级领导的指挥田更成为推动夏季作物获得大丰收的动力。各公社普遍建立了田间管理专业队，加强了责任，进行了划片包干。公社与公社之间、管理区与管理区之间、生产队与生产队之间，定期开展检查评比竞赛，争夺优胜红旗。对庄稼检查评比，分别排队，发现问题，及时增加措施，不断消灭落后苗。
    油菜丰产更加鼓舞了群众的干劲，夏收还未结束，紧张的大春生产高潮已迅速在全县范围内形成，一个全面的高工效超定额运动迅速开展。现在，二十万亩水稻已栽了80％以上，早稻已普遍中耕追肥一次至二次。
