Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sohyo") held a meeting of its executive committee today and adopted the summer-autumn struggle policy, and also adopted a preliminary draft of the "1959 Action Policy Draft."

The meeting unanimously adopted the unified demands of "Sohyo" members: oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and strive to abolish the treaty; oppose "industrial rationalization" and strive to shorten working hours; oppose the "performance appraisal" system; demand higher wages; strive to establish a uniform national minimum wage of 8,000 yen; oppose the suppression of the labor movement and establish workers' rights; expand the social security system.

The meeting decided that the unions affiliated with "Sohyo" would simultaneously hold one-hour workplace rallies and strikes nationwide on June 25th—the third national unified action day to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"—and would continuously launch joint actions thereafter until autumn in order to break the Japan-U.S. "security system"; strive to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations and achieve Japan's neutralization.

The meeting decided that "Sohyo" would launch a unified action on July 21st, the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords on Indochina, against the Japanese government and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem group signing a war reparations agreement.

The meeting also decided that "Sohyo" would fully participate in the Peace March ending in Hiroshima, and would launch a larger-scale show of force on August 6th, the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, than on June 25th.

The meeting decided to establish a joint struggle committee against "industrial rationalization" and for shortening working hours, in order to support the struggle against "industrial rationalization" and for shortening working hours, with the coal miners' union at its center.

The meeting believes that the struggle against the "performance appraisal" system is an important link in the current struggle to safeguard peace, and therefore it should be coordinated with the struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and the struggle to prevent the implementation of the "performance appraisal" system and to demand the abolition of this system should be continued on a national scale.

The conference also decided to invite trade union representatives from the Soviet Union and China to participate in the 12th "Sohyo" Congress. (Attached picture)

    日本“总评”决定夏秋季斗争方针
    打破日美“安全体系”争取实现日本中立化
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天举行干事会会议通过了夏季—秋季的斗争方针，并且通过了“1959年度运动方针草案”的初步草案。
    会议一致通过“总评”会员的统一要求：反对修改日美“安全条约”，争取废除这项条约；反对“产业合理化”，争取缩短工作时间；反对“勤务评定”制度；要求提高工资；争取确立全国一律八千日元的最低工资制度；反对镇压工人运动，确立工人的权利；扩充社会保障制度。
    会议决定，“总评”所属工会在6月25日——阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”第三次全国统一行动日，在全国同时举行一小时的工作场所大会和罢工，并在此后到秋季的期间要连续展开联合行动，以便打破日美“安全体系”；争取恢复日中邦交和实现日本中立化。
    会议决定，“总评”将在7月21日关于印度支那停战的日内瓦协议缔结五周年纪念日展开反对日本政府和南越吴庭艳集团签订战争赔偿协定的统一行动。
    会议还决定，“总评”将全面参加以广岛为终点的和平旅行，并将在8月6日广岛遭受原子弹轰炸纪念日展开比6月25日规模更大的实力行动。
    会议决定将设立反对“产业合理化”、缩短工作时间共同斗争委员会，以便支援以煤矿工会为中心的反对“产业合理化”和争取缩短工作时间的斗争。
    会议认为，反对“勤务评定”制度斗争是目前维护和平的斗争的重要环节，因此要和阻止修改日美“安全条约”斗争互相配合，在全国规模继续展开阻止实施“勤务评定”制度和要求取消这种制度的斗争。
    大会还决定邀请苏联和中国等工会代表参加“总评”第十二次大会。（附图片）
