    A Play with a Special Flavor
    The distinguished play "Aesop," a work with a special flavor, will be performed by the Beijing People's Art Theater in the capital starting July 1st. This is the first Latin American play to be staged in our country. The author, Guilherme Figueiredo, is a contemporary playwright and novelist beloved by the Brazilian people.
    Aesop was a slave fabulist in ancient Greece who was respected and loved by the people. "Aesop's Fables" has become a popular reading material all over the world for people who pursue freedom and happiness. However, very little is recorded about Aesop's life. In the play "Aesop," we will see a talented playwright shape an unforgettable image of an ancient hero who would rather die for freedom than live as a slave. Although the author depicts the life of ancient slave society, it has profound significance for the current struggle of the Latin American people.
    Moraes, the First Secretary of the Brazilian Writers Association and a female writer who recently visited China, watched the dress rehearsal of the play at the theater and introduced the situation when the play was staged in Brazil. She believes that the performance of the Beijing People's Art Theater better embodies the spirit of the play. At the same time, she also praised the performance of the actors. (Nan)

    一出别有风味的话剧
    一出别有风味的名剧“伊索”，7月1日起将由北京人民艺术剧院在首都演出。这是在我国上演的第一个拉丁美洲戏。这个戏的作者吉里耶尔美·菲格莱德是巴西人民喜爱的当代剧作家和小说家。
    伊索是古代希腊一位受人民尊敬和热爱的奴隶寓言家。“伊索寓言”已广泛成为全世界追求自由和幸福的人们普遍爱好的读物，但是，伊索的生平却很少记载。在话剧“伊索”中，我们将看到有才能的剧作家塑造了一个令人难忘的宁为自由而死不作奴隶而生的古代英雄人物的形象。作者描写的虽是古代奴隶社会的生活，它却对当前拉丁美洲人民的现实斗争有着深刻的意义。
    最近来我国访问的巴西作家协会第一书记、女作家莫拉伊斯曾到剧院观看了这出戏的连排，并介绍了巴西上演该剧时的情况。她认为北京人艺的演出较好地体现了剧作的精神，同时，还称赞了演员的表演。　（楠）
