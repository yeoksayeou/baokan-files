Fragments of Anshan Iron and Steel
By our correspondents stationed in Anshan
Early summer, a huge electric locomotive pulls a long string of carriages, speeding along the Anshan city railway. We sit in one of the carriages, talking with the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company who have just finished their early shift. Their work posts are located in the iron mines surrounded by green hills, in the mineral-water-filled ore dressing troughs, under the towering large blast furnace clusters, in front of the flame-scorching open-hearth furnaces, and beside the rolling mill that swallows huge deep-red steel ingots. In the struggle to seize steel, their infinite wisdom, selfless labor, and heroic deeds, should be able to paint many magnificent pictures? Write many magnificent poems?

"Ever-Victorious General"
Hearing people mention "Ever-Victorious General," we thought he was a senior master, at least an older worker. Who would have thought that he was only in his twenties, and spoke shyly, like a young woman. Don't look at his young age, he has repaired almost all of the twenty-odd large open-hearth furnaces in Anshan Iron and Steel, and with his eyes closed, he can accurately tell the characteristics of that furnace. His name is Jin Shixin, he used to work in the metallurgical furnace repair shop of Anshan Iron and Steel, and now he is the leader of the furnace repair team in the furnace repair section of the Second Steelmaking Plant. Because of his young age, people call him Little Jin.
It was not long ago. One night, he had not been asleep for long when he vaguely heard that the No. 10 open-hearth furnace in the Second Steelmaking Plant needed to be repaired. He rubbed his eyes and jumped out of bed, calling up the young men in the group, and immediately rushed to the Second Steelmaking Plant.
When they arrived at the furnace, wow! Even a few feet away from the furnace door, they felt a strange heat scorching their faces. It turned out that the steel workers, in order to produce more steel, hoped to repair it while it was still hot after the steel was tapped. Little Jin thought that one hour is thirty tons of steel, enough to fill a whole train car. Thinking of this, Little Jin's heart was warmed, and he immediately made up his mind: "Repair it while it's hot."
He and the young men put on heat-resistant suits, and then wrapped their heads and bodies with grass bags sprinkled with water, and started to work. In the blink of an eye, a black shadow was seen, swooping into the furnace. He agilely placed the two fire-resistant bricks in his hand, and then rolled out. At this moment, another worker, Sun Mingchun, also went in to replace him, in this way, one came out and one went in, like a shuttle, and quickly built a high false wall. With the false wall blocking the heat radiating from the furnace, the furnace repair was easier to carry out. Then, Little Jin and many workers went in again, and with everyone pitching in, the furnace was repaired. It only took one hour and fifteen minutes. This made the steel workers very happy, according to their original idea, it would take at least seven or eight hours!
The fatigue of the night seemed to have disappeared, Little Jin and his companions walked out of the workshop in the cheers of the people, and the stars in the sky also blinked their eyes, smiling at them.

Climbing New Peaks
When people were celebrating the fact that the utilization coefficient of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 blast furnace had broken the "two" mark, the mood of the young furnace chief, Pei Wei, seemed particularly heavy.
He was very clear in his heart that the air volume of the No. 9 blast furnace was seriously insufficient. The breakthrough of the "two" mark was the result of everyone cleverly increasing the air temperature, allowing the blast furnace to eat less coke, eat more iron ore, and produce more iron. But now, to further increase the air temperature, it has been restricted by equipment conditions, and serious difficulties have been encountered on the road of continued leap forward.
Among the blast furnace chiefs of Anshan Iron and Steel's iron smelting plant, Pei Wei is a brave and resourceful one. He is known for his calm mind and hard work, being able to foresee difficulties when production is smooth, and being good at identifying directions when production is difficult. He often relies on the Party and the masses to find ways to overcome difficulties and continuously push the output of blast furnaces forward.
Now, from a subjective operational point of view, there are only two ways to increase the output of the blast furnace: one is to increase the air volume, so that the coke burns faster, melts the iron ore quickly, and produces more iron; the other is to increase the air temperature to replace part of the fuel, so that the blast furnace eats more raw materials and produces more iron. The situation of the No. 9 furnace is that the blower capacity is insufficient, there is no way to increase the air volume, and to increase the air temperature, it is limited by the capacity of the hot blast stove.
Difficulties are tormenting Pei Wei. As soon as he lies in bed, he hears the roar of the blast furnace in his ears. As soon as he closes his eyes, the production scene during the day comes into his mind. Yesterday, the air temperature did not drop, and the air volume did not decrease. Why did each shift have five or six fewer batches of raw materials? After thinking hard for two consecutive nights, he vaguely thought, is it because one hot blast stove is broken, and in order to prevent the hot air of the blast furnace from lowering the temperature, all the steam valves were closed? He seemed to immediately come to the blast furnace control room and opened all the steam valves, sending much more steam than usual, and as a result, this shift added seven more batches of materials. He was so happy that he shouted, and when he woke up in shock, it turned out to be a dream before dawn.
As soon as he went to work, he told the third shift foreman about his ideas in detail, asking them to analyze and discuss them and put forward more opinions. Everyone felt that sending more steam was equivalent to sending more air, and it was better than sending air alone. The steam contained more oxygen, which could help the coke burn better and increase the air volume.
Starting the next day, they tested sending more steam, gradually increasing the steam to the highest limit.
As a result, in this ten-day period, the air volume from the blower did not increase, but the smelting intensity of the blast furnace increased a lot, adding six batches of materials a day, and producing fifty more tons of pig iron per day.

Constantly Creating New Records
"The workers of the C shift of the No. 16 open-hearth furnace, in only five minutes and thirty seconds, smelted a heat of high-quality steel, breaking the record created by Hou Yingwu in the past, and reaching the highest record for rapid steelmaking in large open-hearth furnaces!" In all the broadcast loudspeakers in Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Steelmaking Plant, the same loud voice was heard.
Outside the plant, the night was hazy. In Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Steelmaking Plant, a long row of large open-hearth furnaces spewed flames, illuminating the front of the furnace. Liu Zhike, the furnace chief of the No. 16 open-hearth furnace, was full of energy before taking over the shift. Yesterday, he led all the workers of the shift, smelting a heat of steel in five minutes and forty-five seconds, shortening the plan by four minutes and five seconds, creating the highest record for rapid steelmaking in large open-hearth furnaces since this year. However, Hou Yingwu also created the highest record on this open-hearth furnace last year, exceeding the current record by five minutes. Thinking of this, Liu Zhike felt a burst of tension, muttering to himself: "Where to dig out these five minutes?" He and all the steel workers in the shift discussed it in this gap: Grasping the time for each process such as furnace patching, charging, and melting, it is possible to be faster than yesterday.
Liu Zhike's shift came to the furnace early, wandering around the open-hearth furnace. They carefully observed the furnace walls, furnace roof, and the flames in the furnace, checked the tools, and prepared to patch the furnace. Now, the conditions for creating a new record are all available. Liu Zhike, on behalf of all the steel workers in the shift, found the Party branch secretary and said: "We guarantee that this heat of steel will create a new record, please support us by the Party branch!" The factory's broadcast loudspeakers immediately sounded everywhere: "The No. 16 open-hearth furnace will create and break its own record tonight, breaking yesterday's highest record, and we hope that all sections will pay attention to coordination!"
Before the last can of molten steel from the previous shift was finished, they were patching the furnace in front of the furnace. As soon as the furnace was patched, the charging machine stretched its neck and used the rapid charging method to quickly push the troughs of ore into the furnace. Liu Zhike ran to adjust the gas valve for a while, and observed the molten steel wearing blue glasses, checking the furnace door and furnace roof, and whatever he did, he was fast and neat. After a while, Liu Zhike observed the white-hot molten steel in the furnace through the blue glasses. It was like a pot of boiling porridge, with the molten steel rolling up and down, indicating that it had not been refined yet. The wall clock in the control room seemed to be running particularly fast, and the long hand had turned five circles. Liu Zhike was a little anxious, muttering to himself: "It's already five hours, is it not going to work tonight?" When he turned around, the molten steel had calmed down and changed color. Taking out a spoonful of steel sample, the steel flowers splashed everywhere, and without testing, it could be seen that it was a heat of good steel. The testers confirmed the results of the workers' visual observation. He grabbed a towel wrapped around his neck and wiped his sweat, and excitedly raised his right hand and shouted: "Tap the steel"...
              ×　　×　　×
Anshan Iron and Steel, the first steel base in the motherland, has no less than thousands of heroes here. We have met countless advanced producers and labor models here. In this year's steel production task, they will gloriously contribute greater strength to the motherland.

    鞍钢片断
    本报驻鞍山记者集体采写
    初夏，巨大的电机车拉着长串的车厢，在鞍山环市铁路上驰骋，我们坐在其中一个车厢里，和鞍山钢铁公司刚下早班的工人们谈论着。他们的劳动岗位，有的在青山环抱的铁矿山里，有的在矿水滚滚的选矿槽间，还有在巍峨的大型高炉群下、在火焰炙人的平炉前、在吞食巨大深红色钢锭的轧钢机旁。在夺取钢铁的斗争中，他们表现的无穷的智慧，忘我的劳动，英勇的事迹，该能绘出多少幅绚烂的画面？写下多少首壮丽的诗篇？
    “常胜将军”
    听人提到“常胜将军”，我们以为他是一个老师傅，起码也是个年岁较大的工人。那想到他还只有二十几岁，说起话来羞羞答答，倒像个大姑娘。别看他年纪轻，鞍钢的二十几座炼钢大平炉，他差不多个个都修过，闭起眼来，能够一点不错地说出那座炉有什么特点。他叫靳世新，过去在鞍钢冶金炉修理厂工作，现在是第二炼钢厂修炉工段修炉小组组长。因为年纪轻，人家都叫他小靳。
    还是不久以前的事。那一天夜里，他睡下不久，恍恍惚惚听说第二炼钢厂十号平炉要修理。他揉揉眼睛，就一骨碌跳下床来，叫起全组小伙子们，马上奔到第二炼钢厂。
    到了炉前，吓！离炉门还有好几尺，就觉得热古冬冬的怪烤脸。原来刚出完钢，炼钢工人为了多出钢，希望能趁热修理。小靳想，一小时就是三十吨钢，整整装一火车皮呢。想到这些，小靳心里热呼呼的，一下子就下了决心：“趁热修”。
    他和小伙子们身上穿起防热服，然后头上和身上又包扎上洒过水的草袋子，就动起手来。眨眨眼的工夫，只见一个黑影，嗖的一下钻进了炉内。他敏捷地放好手里两块耐火砖，就翻身钻了出来。就在这时，另一个工人孙明春也钻了进去，替换他，这样，一个出来一个进去，像穿梭似的，很快就砌好高高的一层假墙。有了假墙挡住炉膛里射过来的热气，修炉也就好进行了。接着，小靳同许多工人又钻了进去，七手八脚，就把炉子修好了。前后只用一小时零十五分钟。这可把炼钢工人乐坏了，按照他们的想法，至少得用七、八个小时呢！
    一夜的疲劳好像已经消失，小靳和他的同伴在人们的喝采声中走出了车间，满天的星星也眨着眼睛，向他们微笑。
    攀登新高峰
    当人们在欢庆鞍钢第九号高炉利用系数突破“二”的大关的时候，年轻炉长裴伟的心情，却显得特别沉重。
    他内心里很清楚，九高炉风量严重不足，突破“二”的难关是大家巧妙地提高了风温，让高炉少吃焦炭，多吃铁矿石，多出铁的结果。可是现在，要进一步再提高风温，已经受到设备条件的限制，在继续跃进的道路上，碰到了严重的困难。
    在鞍钢炼铁厂高炉炉长中，裴伟是勇敢机智的一个。他以头脑冷静、刻苦钻研闻名，能在生产顺利时预见到困难，在生产困难时又善于识别方向。他经常依靠党和群众找出战胜困难的办法，不断把高炉产量向前推进。
    现在，从主观操作上来讲，让高炉增产只有两条办法：一条是加大风量，使焦炭加速燃烧，快熔化铁矿石，多出铁；另一条是提高风温，来代替部分燃料，使高炉多吃原料，多出铁。九号炉所处的情况，鼓风机能力不足，没有办法再加大风量，要提高风温，又受到热风炉能力的限制。
    困难在折磨着裴伟，他一躺在床上，耳边就响起了高炉的呼啸声，一闭上眼睛，白天生产情景就钻到他脑子里来。昨天，风温没有下降，风量也没有减少，为什么每班都少上五、六批原料呢？连续苦思了两夜，他恍惚想到，是不是因为坏了一个热风炉，为了使高炉的热风不降低温度，把所有蒸汽阀门都关死了的原因呢？他好像立刻来到高炉操纵室，把蒸汽阀门都打开了，比平时多送好多蒸汽，结果这一班多上了七批料。他高兴得喊了起来，一惊醒来，原来是黎明前的一个梦。
    一上班，他就把自己的想法，详细地告诉了三班工长，要他们分析讨论，多提出一些意见来。大家都觉得多送蒸汽，就等于多送风，而且比单送风好，蒸汽里含氧的成份多，更能帮助焦炭的燃烧，又能增加风量。
    第二天开始，他们就试验多送蒸汽，逐渐把蒸汽增加到最高的限度。
    结果，在这一旬里，从鼓风机来的风量并没有增加，高炉冶炼强度提高了很多，一天增加六批料，每天多出生铁五十多吨。
    不断创造新纪录
    “十六号平炉丙班工人，只用五点三十分钟的时间，炼出一炉优质钢，打破了过去侯英武创造的纪录，达到大型平炉快速炼钢最高纪录啦！”在鞍钢第二炼钢厂中所有的广播大喇叭里，都同样发出这个宏亮的声音。
    厂外夜色朦胧，鞍钢第二炼钢厂里长长一排大型平炉，喷吐着火焰，照得炉前透亮。十六号平炉炉长刘智科，接班前就浑身是劲。昨天，他率领全班工人，用五点四十五分钟炼了一炉钢，比计划缩短了四点零五分钟，创造了今年以来大型平炉快速炼钢的最高纪录。可是，侯英武去年也在这个平炉上创造过最高纪录，比现在的纪录还超过五分钟呢。想到这些，刘智科一阵紧张，自语着：“从那里挖掘这五分钟呢？”他和全班炼钢工人，利用这个空隙商量了一下：抓紧补炉、装料、熔化等每道工序的时间，是有可能比昨天更快一些的。
    刘智科班提前来到炉前，在平炉四处晃来晃去，他们仔细观察炉墙、炉顶、炉膛里的火焰，检查工具，准备补炉。现在，创造更新纪录的条件已样样俱全。刘智科代表全班炼钢工人，找到了党支部书记说：“我们保证这炉钢要创更新的纪录，请党支部支持我们！”全厂的广播喇叭立刻到处响起来：“十六号平炉今晚要自创自破，打破昨天的最高纪录，希望各工段注意配合！”
    上一班工人最后一罐钢水还没有出完，他们就在炉前补炉。炉刚刚补完，装料机伸长脖子运用快速装料法，把一槽槽矿石迅速地顶进了炉膛。刘智科一会儿跑去调整煤气阀，一会儿戴着蓝色眼镜片观察钢水，检查炉门、炉顶，无论干那一件事都快速利落。过了一阵，刘智科又透过蓝色的眼镜片，观察炉里白热的钢水，真像一锅煮沸了的稀粥，钢水上下直翻滚，说明还没有炼好。操纵室墙上的挂钟，似乎走得特别快，长针已经转了五个圈。刘智科有点焦急，暗暗自语：“已经五个钟头啦，难道今晚不成了吗？”当他转过身来，钢水已经平静、变了色。掏出一勺钢样，钢花四溅，不用化验已看出是一炉好钢，化验员把工人们肉眼观察的结果证实了。他捞着一条围在脖子上的毛巾擦擦汗水，兴奋地把右手一举，喊出了：“出钢”……
              ×　　×　　×
    鞍钢，祖国第一个钢铁基地，这里的英雄何止万千，我们在这里不知碰到过多少先进生产者和劳动模范。在今年的钢产任务中，他们将光荣地为祖国贡献出更大的力量。
