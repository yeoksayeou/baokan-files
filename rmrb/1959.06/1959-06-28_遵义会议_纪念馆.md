At the foot of Honghuagang, on the banks of the Xiangjiang River, stands a two-story gray brick building. The historically famous "Zunyi Conference" was held in a room on the upper floor of this building. The only furnishings in this room are a long table, a dozen chairs and stools of different sizes and styles, and a large wall clock. This simple room, less than twenty square meters in size, wrote a very important and glorious page in the history of the Party. The large wall clock has been ticking for more than twenty-four years. Under the leadership of the outstanding great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese revolution, starting from here, embarked on a broad road, advanced bravely, and went from victory to victory.

In the rooms connected to this room, the slogans written by Red Army soldiers on the walls, such as "Welcome White Army brothers to join the Red Army," "Redden all of Guizhou," and "Strike the local tyrants and divide the land," are still clearly visible. After the Red Army left, the warlords who lived in this building covered these slogans with grout countless times, but today the grout has fallen off, and the slogans promoting the revolution written by the Red Army soldiers still emit their former glory.

Thousands of revolutionary historical relics are displayed and collected in this building. There are the "Ten Major Programs," "Public Notice of the Political Department," and "Letter to Poor Peasants" distributed by the Red Army in those years, as well as banknotes printed by the Chinese Soviet Republic, weapons used by the Red Army in combat, and the clothes, shoes, socks, food bags, and rice bowls of Red Army soldiers. At the end of 1934, the Red Army entered eastern Guizhou along the Miao Mountains, crossed the Wujiang River twice, occupied Zunyi twice, crossed the Chishui River four times, and went west to Yunnan. On this journey of more than six thousand miles passing through forty-seven counties and cities, the Red Army established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the broad masses, sowed the seeds of revolution among all ethnic groups, and left a profound impact.

Among the exhibits is a public notice from the General Political Department of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, preserved by Yang Dengfeng, an elderly Buyi man from Banfu Village, Guanling County. This large-character public notice and the lithographic press that printed it are particularly eye-catching. The public notice clearly stated the Party's policies on resisting Japan, land, and industry and commerce. After the Red Army left, Yang Dengfeng collected this public notice, which reflected his own wishes. Wang Yunpo, a landlord in the same village, threatened the old man's entire family with death to hand over the public notice. The old man was not intimidated. For more than ten years, he endured fear and hid it countless times, from wall cracks to roof tiles. After liberation, his wish was realized. During the land reform, Yang Dengfeng presented this precious revolutionary historical relic to the People's Government.

Among the exhibits is an old-fashioned notebook, worn yellow by the years, containing seven poems written by Yang Hejun, a Dong peasant. These simple poems record an epic of tragic revolution. When the Red Army left Podong Village, Jinping County, they left a wounded Red Army soldier at Yang Hejun's house. Yang Hejun referred to this wounded soldier as Company Commander Wang in his poems. He personally took care of and served Company Commander Wang, and learned revolutionary principles from Company Commander Wang. This was learned by reactionaries in the village. When they went to capture Company Commander Wang, Company Commander Wang dragged his wounded body and broke free from the ropes several times. Yang Hejun tried his best to rescue him, but was ineffective due to his limited strength. Two days later, Company Commander Wang was killed amidst heroic slogans. After Company Commander Wang was killed, Yang Hejun seemed lost and dejected, crying all day while holding Company Commander Wang's old cotton coat, loudly cursing the reactionaries. Not long after, Yang Hejun was also killed by the reactionaries. After liberation, Yang Hejun's second son donated this notebook to the memorial hall. The first three of the seven poems describe the excitement and joy he felt from learning revolutionary principles and seeing a bright future from Red Army Company Commander Wang, while the last four poems are all mourning Company Commander Wang. In the last poem, Yang Hejun clearly expressed his desire to find the Red Army, "I want to find that bright and splendid red sun." However, before his wish could be realized, he was killed by the reactionaries.

### “遵义会议”纪念馆

    “遵义会议”纪念馆
    红花岗下，湘江河畔，伫立着一座灰砖砌成的两层楼房，历史上有名的“遵义会议”就是在这座楼房的楼上一间房子里召开的。这间房子里仅有的布置，是一条长桌、十多个大小不同、式样不同的椅子、凳子，和墙上的一座大挂钟。这间朴素的不到二十平方公尺大的房间，给党的历史写下了极重要而光辉的一页。墙上的大挂钟已经不息的行走了二十四年多。中国共产党和中国革命，在杰出的伟大领袖毛主席领导下，以这里为起点，奔上康庄大道，勇往直前，从胜利走向胜利。
    与这间房子相连的几间房子墙壁上，红军战士们写的标语“欢迎白军兄弟过来当红军”、“赤化全贵州”、“打土豪分田地”等，还清晰可见。红军走后，住在这座房子里的军阀，无数次用灰浆遮盖了这些标语，而今天那些灰浆都已脱落了，红军战士们写下的宣传革命的标语，却还发出昔日的光辉。
    在这座楼房里陈列和收藏着成千件革命历史文物。有当年红军散发的“十大政纲”、“政治部布告”、“告贫农书”，还有中华苏维埃共和国印发的钞票，红军作战的武器，红军战士的衣服鞋袜、粮袋、饭碗等等。1934年底，红军沿苗岭进入贵州东部，两渡乌江，两占遵义，四渡赤水，西出云南，在这途经四十七个县市的六千多里征途上，红军和广大群众建立了血肉联系，在各族人民中播下了革命种子，留下了深远影响。
    陈列品中有一张工农红军总政治部的布告，是关岭县板枹村布依族老人杨登峰保存下来的。这份大张大字布告和印它的石印机摆在一起，特别引人注目。这布告上写明了党的抗日、土地、工商等政策。杨登峰在红军走后，把这份反映着自己心愿的布告收藏起来。同村地主王云坡，曾以杀全家威胁老人交出布告。老人没有被吓住，十多年中，他历尽惊恐，由墙缝到瓦缝，作了无数次搬藏。解放了，他的心愿实现了，土地改革时杨登峰把这份珍贵的革命历史文物献给人民政府。
    陈列品中，有一个被岁月磨损成灰黄色的旧式本子，本子里是侗族农民杨和钧写的七首诗。这几首朴素的诗篇里，记载了一首悲壮的革命史诗。当红军离开锦屏县婆洞村时，在杨和钧家寄放了一名红军伤员，杨和钧在诗里称这位伤员为王连长。他亲自照看服侍王连长，并从王连长那里懂得了革命道理。这事被本村反动分子得知，他们去捉拿王连长的时候，王连长拖着带伤的身子几次挣脱绳索，杨和钧拼命抢救，终因力单势孤而无效。两天以后，王连长在壮烈口号声中被杀害。王连长被害后，杨和钧似失魂落魄，整天抱着王连长的一件旧棉衣哭泣，大声咒骂反动分子，不久以后杨和钧也被反动分子杀害。解放后，杨和钧第二个儿子把这本子献给纪念馆。七首诗中的前三首，都是描述他从红军王连长那里懂得了革命道理，看到了光明未来而感到的兴奋和欣喜，后四首都是悼念王连长的，在最后一首诗中，杨和钧明显表示了自己想去寻找红军的愿望，“我要去找寻那光辉灿烂的红日”。可是，在愿望没有实现以前，即被反动分子杀害。
