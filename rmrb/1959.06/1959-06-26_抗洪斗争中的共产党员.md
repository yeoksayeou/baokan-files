Communist Party Members in the Fight Against Floods

    The Communist Party members of Huiyang and Boluo counties in Guangdong Province demonstrated the excellent quality of serving the people wholeheartedly in the fight against flood relief.

    Didn't Eat for Two Days and Nights, Rescuing People Door to Door

    Liu Tinghe, the Party branch secretary of the Gu Xian Brigade of the Ru Hu People's Commune in Boluo County, mobilized the masses to evacuate to a safe area. He didn't eat or sleep for two consecutive days and nights. Wherever he went, people heard him urging the masses to evacuate safely. Only when all the brigade members were safely out of danger did Liu Tinghe faint from exhaustion. Huiyang County's Huihuan People's Commune was the most severely affected by the disaster, but none of the more than 9,000 commune members were sacrificed. Li Xi, the Party branch secretary of the Dongping Brigade of this commune, personally led the cadres to rescue people door to door. When they arrived at the home of Zhang Yan, an old man in his seventies, they asked him to move, but the old man didn't believe there would be such a big flood and was unwilling to leave his home. At this time, the flood had already surrounded Zhang Yan's dilapidated building, and Li Xi could no longer wait. He carried the old man out, and only five minutes later, the house collapsed. Zhang Yan said with emotion at this time, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's good cadres to rescue me, I would have lost my life."

    Breaking Through at Midnight to Get in Touch, More Than 10,000 People Were All Rescued

    Zhong Bing, a member of the Boluo County Party Committee, was trapped by the flood in Yangcun Commune, and contact was lost. More than 10,000 people in the entire commune had no food. In order to get in touch with the higher authorities and rescue the masses, Zhong Bing found an old boatman, and the two of them took a small boat to break through the waves. They drifted in the flood for more than ten hours and finally arrived in Huiyang in the middle of the night, making contact with the Dongjiang Flood Control Headquarters of the Foshan Prefectural Committee. The next day, a large amount of grain was continuously transported to Yangcun by water, and all the people trapped by the flood were rescued.

    Ensuring the Machines Are Not Flooded, Huiyang City Regains Light

    On June 14, when the flood rushed into the urban area of Huiyang, Su Fen, the Communist Party member and deputy director of the Huiyang County Huizhou Power Plant, immediately mobilized and organized all the factory workers to quickly block all the water inlets in the factory. After the flood came, he and the workers worked continuously for several days and nights to pump out the water that seeped into the factory with pumps. His home was flooded on this day, and the workers in the factory urged him to leave the factory quickly to rescue his wife and children, but he firmly said, "Ensuring that the machines are not flooded is my task, I cannot go back." Later, the workers rescued his wife and children for him. Thanks to the active and persistent efforts of Su Fen and the workers in protecting the machines, Huiyang City regained its light on the fourth night after the flood receded, and many factories also resumed production.

    抗洪斗争中的共产党员
    广东省惠阳、博罗两县的共产党员在抗洪救灾斗争中，表现了全心全意为人民服务的优秀品质。
    两天两夜没吃饭　逐家逐户去救人
    博罗县汝湖人民公社古先大队党支部书记刘庭和动员群众撤到安全地带，连续两天两夜没吃饭没睡觉，他到那里，那里就听到他动员群众安全转移的喊声。直到全大队的社员安全脱险时，刘庭和因疲劳过度，昏迷过去了。惠阳县惠环人民公社这次受灾最严重，但是全公社九千多社员，没有一个牺牲。这个公社东平大队党支部书记李喜，亲自带领干部逐家逐户去救人。他们到了七十多岁的老人张燕的家里，叫他搬家，但是这个老人还不相信有那么大的洪水，不愿意离开家里。这时候洪水已经把张燕住的危楼包围，李喜再也不能等待了，把老人抱了出来，仅仅经过五分钟时间，这所房屋便倒塌了。这时候张燕感动地说：“要不是共产党和毛主席的好干部来抢救，我一定没命了。”
    深夜突围取联系　一万多人全得救
    中共博罗县委委员钟丙被洪水围困在杨村公社，联络中断，全公社一万多群众粮米无着，钟丙为了要和上级取得联系，抢救群众。他找了一个老梢公，两个人乘了一艘小艇破浪而下，在洪水中漂流了十多个小时，终于在深夜到达惠阳，与佛山地委东江抗洪指挥部取得了联系，第二天大批米粮从水路源源运到杨村，被洪水围困的群众全部得救。
    保证机器不受淹　惠阳城重放光明
    6月14日，当洪水冲进惠州市区的时候，惠阳县惠州电力厂副厂长共产党员苏芬，立即动员组织全厂职工迅速把全厂能进水的口都堵起来。洪水到来以后，他又和工人们连续几个昼夜不停地用抽水机把渗进厂里来的水抽出去。他的家在这一天被洪水淹了，厂里工人劝他赶快离厂抢救妻儿，他坚决地说：“保证机器不受浸，就是我的任务，我不能回去。”后来，工人们替他把妻儿抢救了出来。由于苏芬和工人们积极坚持奋战，保护好机器，在洪水退后的第四天晚上，惠阳城又重放光明，许多工厂也恢复生产了。（据新华社讯）
