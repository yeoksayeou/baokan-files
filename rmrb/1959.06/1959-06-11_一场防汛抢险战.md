On the afternoon of the 3rd, it was raining heavily. The Miluo People's Commune, which is close to the east Dongting Lake, was holding meetings in various areas to enthusiastically discuss the movement for increased grain production when the alarm gongs of the flood prevention reconnaissance team on the dam rang loudly. People came from all directions carrying baskets and hoes, rushing to the dam. A tense battle to fight against the water to protect grain began.

The rain fell heavier and heavier, with more than 140 millimeters of rainfall in a day and night, and more than a foot of water accumulated on the ground. This is the tail-end area of the Miluo River, with a small outlet and a large inlet, shaped like a bag. The downstream entrance to the lake, about ten miles away, only has a flow of more than 2,200, but the upstream flow, about fifteen miles away, has more than 3,500. The "belly" grew bigger and bigger, and the water level rose higher and higher. Many high embankments were then topped by the floodwaters. The battle for flood prevention and rescue entered the most intense stage.

At night, gas lamps and torches were lit everywhere on the embankment, and the firelight reddened half the sky. In the turbulent rapids, water divers were plugging loopholes in the bottom of the water several meters deep; a continuous stream of people on the dam were filling soil, driving piles, and reinforcing the embankment. Wherever a warning green light was lit, people rushed to that location.

Just as night fell, the six-meter-high embankment of the Liao Mawei began to be topped. Yang Donglin, deputy secretary of the commune party committee, led more than 1,500 members to fight for rescue. Their slogan was: "When water comes, cover it with earth; when the water rises an inch, raise the earth a foot." They fought hard for nine hours and generally raised the embankment by more than a foot. In the windy and rainy night, Yang Dequan, secretary of the commune party committee, was making a phone call in a thatched shed on the embankment when he suddenly heard someone shouting outside: "Eight holes have been pierced in the Gou Tou Di, and the Huxiwei can't be held!"

"What? The Huxiwei..." Secretary Yang immediately thought that there were not only eight thousand acres of good rice seedlings here, but also the north-south artery of the motherland—the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway line—passing through here. It was absolutely necessary not to let the flood rush in. He forgot that he had been sick for three or four days and ran towards the Gou Tou Di. He ran there, inspected the water situation, and without catching his breath, immediately joined the battle. He waved a sledgehammer to drive piles, and drove more than twenty piles with the masses without stopping. Seeing that the party committee secretary was so selfless, some went into the water, some carried soil, blocking from the outside and filling from the inside, and finally plugged the eight loopholes. At this time, Secretary Yang was also exhausted and fainted on the embankment. Everyone immediately helped him home. But after walking a short distance, when he woke up, he broke away from those who were supporting him and plunged into another rescue battle.

It was late at night, and the north wind howled. Waves several feet high violently pounded the embankment on the north bank one after another. Large chunks of soil on the north embankment were swallowed by the flood peak, and the reeds used to block the waves were also used up. The situation was very serious. At this critical juncture, Communist Party member Yu Jianhe and Communist Youth League member Yang Yixing took the lead in jumping into the water to block the waves with their bodies. Then, twelve young people jumped into the water, hand in hand, forming a long dike to block the waves and protect the embankment. The masses were deeply moved, and everyone brought wheat straw, mats, and cotton wool from their homes to the embankment to block the waves and plug the loopholes.

At more than two o'clock in the morning, Secretary Yang Dequan received a notice from the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in the telephone room on the embankment, saying that 20,000 cubic meters of timber had been scattered by the flood upstream and were flowing downstream. Even if it did not destroy the Miluo Railway Bridge, it would block the water flow and raise the water level, which was a serious problem. After research by the commune party committee, it was decided to send people upstream to intercept the timber. But at that time, more than 2,000 laborers from five production brigades were on the embankment, where could they spare people? So that night, the commune held a telephone conference on the embankment, calling on the seven production brigades without flood prevention tasks to send people to support them. That night, these seven production brigades sent more than 1,100 people from one or twenty miles away to support them. The teachers and students of the Third Middle School in the county, workers, office cadres and residents in nearby towns, most of them also joined the flood prevention battle.

Fighting from late at night to dawn, and from dawn to late at night again, after two days and two nights of intense rescue, people finally subdued the flood and defended more than 20,000 acres of lush rice fields in the whole commune.

    一场防汛抢险战
    新华社记者  胡坚
    3日下午，倾盆大雨。紧挨着洞庭湖东?的汨罗人民公社正在分片召开会议热烈讨论粮食丰产运动的时候，大堤上防汛侦察队的告警锣当当地响起来了。人们从四面八方挑着箢箕，扛着锄头，奔向大堤。一场紧张的与水争粮的战斗开始了。
    雨越下越大，一昼夜降雨一百四十多公厘，平地积水一尺多深。这里是汨罗江的尾闾地区，出口小，进口大，是个布袋形。距这里十来里的下游入湖处只有二千二百多个流量，可是隔这里十五里的上游流量却有三千五百多个。肚子越鼓越大，水位越涨越高。许多高大的堤防跟着被洪水漫顶了。防汛抢险的战斗进入了最紧张的阶段。
    入夜。堤防上到处燃起了煤气灯和火炬，火光照红了半边天。在波涛汹涌的激流里，汆水手们在几丈深的水底堵塞漏洞；大堤上川流不息的人群在填土打桩，加固堤防。哪里告警的绿灯亮了，人们便奔向哪里。
    当夜幕刚临时，廖马垸六公尺多高的堤防开始漫顶了。公社党委副书记杨冬林带领一千五百多社员奋力抢救。他们的口号是：“水来土掩，水涨一寸，土高一尺。”他们奋战九小时，把堤身普遍加高了一尺多。在风雨交加的深夜，公社党委书记杨德泉正在大堤上的茅棚子里打电话，猛然他听到外面有人在喊：“狗头堤穿了八个洞，湖溪垸保不住啦！”
    “怎么？湖溪垸……”杨书记马上想到这里不单是有八千亩好禾苗，还有祖国的南北大动脉——京广铁路线过这里，万万不能让洪水冲进来。他忘记了自己已经病了三、四天，拔步向狗头堤跑去。他跑到那里视察了水势，气还没有喘匀，就立即投入了战斗。他挥舞着大锤打桩木，一连和群众一道打了二十多个桩没有歇气。大家看到党委书记这样奋不顾身，就下水的下水，挑土的挑土，外面堵，内面塞，终于把八个漏洞堵住了。这时，杨书记也累得精疲力竭，晕倒在堤上。大家当即扶着他回家。但是走一段路，当他清醒过来时，他摆脱了扶他的人，又投入了另一次抢险战斗。
    夜深了，北风呼呼地叫。几尺高的大浪，一个接一个地猛烈冲击着北岸的堤防。北堤上一大块一大块的泥土给洪峰吞噬了，挡浪的芦苇也用完了，情况十分严重。在这个千钧一发的紧要关头，共产党员喻建和和共青团员杨怡兴就带头跳下水去，用自己的身体挡住大浪。接着，十二个青年人都跳下水去，手拉手地结成一条长堤，挡浪护堤。群众深受感动，大家从家里把麦秆、晒簟、棉絮，都搬来堤上挡浪、塞漏洞。
    深夜两点多钟，杨德泉书记在堤上电话室里接到中共湘潭地委一个通知说：上游有两万立方公尺的木材被洪水冲散了，正顺流而下，不冲毁汨罗大铁桥，也会阻塞水流，抬高水位，是一个严重的问题。公社党委会研究后，决定派人到上游去截住木材。可是当时五个生产大队两千多劳动力都上堤了，哪里还抽得出人呢？于是当晚公社在大堤上召开电话会议，号召没有防汛任务的七个生产大队派人来支援。当晚这七个生产大队就派出一千一百多人从一、二十里路外赶来支援。县立第三中学的师生、附近小镇上的工人、机关干部和居民，绝大部分也都投入了防汛战斗。
    从深夜战斗到天明，从天明又战斗到深夜，经过两天两晚的紧张抢险，人们终于制伏了洪水，保卫住了全社两万多亩满垅青葱的稻禾。
