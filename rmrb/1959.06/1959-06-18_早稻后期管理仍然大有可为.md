Late-stage Management of Early Rice Still Offers Great Potential

Early rice in the Yangtze River basin is developing vigorously, with most of it entering the heading stage. Some are in the early heading stage, some in the mid-heading stage, and a small portion has entered the flowering and grain-filling stage. This is the crucial period for strengthening late-stage field management.

At this time of year, some people are often misled by the lush growth of the rice seedlings and become complacent, believing that further management will not have much impact. This understanding does not align with the actual growth of the seedlings and the growth patterns of early rice. Past experience has shown that the changes in early rice seedlings are still significant at this stage; they can improve or deteriorate. Field management continues to play a significant role.

According to the growth and development patterns of early rice, the heading stage is crucial for determining panicle size and grain quantity. Scientific research has proven that early rice absorbs the most nutrients from the start of young panicle differentiation to the heading stage, accounting for more than 50% of the total absorption during the entire growth period, with the proportion of potassium fertilizer absorption being slightly higher than that of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. Furthermore, looking at the development process of early rice panicles, the shape and number of spikelets are generally determined within about eight to ten days after the start of young panicle differentiation. Therefore, applying a panicle fertilizer before or at the early stage of young panicle differentiation can not only increase the number of spikelets but also turn some ineffective tillers into effective tillers. By the mid-heading stage, the spikelets gradually grow; at this time, some spikelets degenerate, and if nutrients are insufficient, the number of degenerated spikelets will increase. Therefore, for nutrient-deficient seedlings, applying a panicle fertilizer at this time can significantly reduce the number of degenerated spikelets, thereby relatively increasing the number of effective grains after heading.

The period from heading and flowering to grain-filling and maturity is crucial for achieving plump and heavy grains. Is it necessary to supplement with some nutrients during this period? This depends on the growth of the seedlings at that time and the previous fertilization. According to scientific research results, the nutrient absorption of seedlings during this stage accounts for about 20% of the total absorption, with a higher proportion of phosphorus fertilizer and similar proportions of nitrogen and potassium fertilizers. From the perspective of the grain-filling and maturation process of early rice, it generally takes about twelve days from flowering and pollination to the end of the grain-filling period, which is the period when the grains gain weight most rapidly. If there is a lack of water and nutrients during this period, it will affect grain filling. Therefore, at the beginning of heading, supplementing nitrogen and potassium fertilizers appropriately for nutrient-deficient seedlings will have a certain effect on promoting grain filling. As for phosphorus fertilizer, it can be applied by spraying, and the amount of phosphorus fertilizer to be sprayed should be determined based on the phosphorus content of the soil.

During the late stage of early rice growth, the external climate has a significant impact on the number of panicles, the number of grains, and the grain weight. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen cultivation management to enhance the disaster resistance of the seedlings; on the other hand, it is necessary to increase vigilance against adverse weather conditions such as drought, flooding, and wind, and make preparations for disaster prevention. In recent years, various regions have accumulated rich experience in drought and flood prevention, and the coastal areas of the southeast have also achieved some successful experience in wind prevention. To ensure a bumper harvest of early rice, these experiences should be well utilized to prevent problems before they occur.

In late-stage management, pest and disease prevention is also an important task. Judging from the occurrence of diseases and pests in various parts of the south, although early rice diseases and pests have been initially suppressed, the damage period has not yet passed. Effective measures must be taken to prevent stem borers from causing whiteheads, to prevent rice planthoppers and leafhoppers from affecting the enlargement of early rice panicle embryos and flowering and grain setting, and to prevent rice blast from appearing on the panicle neck.

To do a good job in the late-stage management of early rice, it is necessary to enable the broad masses to master the growth patterns of early rice and, in conjunction with the specific conditions of each region, identify the key measures for each plot of land. Recently, in many areas, leading cadres have gone deep down, grasped typical examples, set examples, and made breakthroughs at one point to promote the overall situation. This effectively shattered the "fixed outcome" mentality of some people. Cadres and the masses all recognized that there is great potential in the late-stage management of early rice, truly achieving communication in words, thoughts, and actions, with full confidence and increased enthusiasm. For example, the First Secretaries of the Prefectural and County Party Committees of the Wuzhou Prefecture in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region spent most of their time in the previous period going deep into the grassroots and into the fields to discover problems and take measures, thus launching the late-stage field management of early rice throughout the region in a vigorous manner; soon, more than 150,000 mu of third-class seedlings were eliminated. The Cangwu County Party Committee went to the Xindi Commune for three days and organized cadres and technicians to inspect the seedlings in the fields four times. For the problems found in the inspection, they held discussions with farmers to find solutions and promptly guided the field management work throughout the county. These practices have had very good results.

Most rice-growing areas are still about a month away from the large-scale maturity of early rice. Everyone must seize the time and compete with heaven and earth for grain, seize the opportunity, grasp the key, and carry out the late-stage field management of early rice to the end, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of early rice.

### 早稻后期管理仍然大有可为

    早稻后期管理仍然大有可为
    长江流域早稻发育茁壮，大部分进入孕穗期，有的处在孕穗初期，有的处在孕穗中期，一小部分进入扬花灌浆阶段。这正是加强后期田间管理的关键时期。
    在这个季节，有些人往往为生长繁茂的禾苗所迷惑，产生松劲情绪，认为再加工管理作用不大了，这种认识与禾苗实际生长情况和早稻生长规律是不相符合的。过去的事实证明，在这个阶段，早稻禾苗的变化仍然很大，可以变得更好，也可以变坏。田间管理仍然起很大的作用。
    根据早稻生长发育的规律，孕穗期是决定穗大粒多的重要阶段。科学研究证明：早稻从幼穗开始分化到出穗期吸收养分最多，约占早稻整个生长时期总吸收量的50％以上，其中钾肥吸收比例比氮、磷肥略高。再从早稻稻穗发育过程来看，一般在幼穗开始分期后的八天到十天左右，小穗的雏形和数目的多少已基本上确定下来。因此，在幼穗开始分化前或分化初期，施用一次穗肥，不仅可以增加小穗数目，而且可使部分无效分蘖变为有效分蘖。到了孕穗中期，小穗逐渐成长；这时，有部分小穗退化，如果养分不足，退化数量就会增多。因此，对于缺肥的禾苗，在这时施用一次穗肥，可以显著减少小穗退化的数目，因而也就可以相对地增加抽穗后的有效粒数。
    早稻从抽穗扬花到灌浆成熟，是争取粒饱粒重的关键时期。到了这个时期，是否还需要补充一部分养分呢？这要看当时禾苗生长情况和前期施肥的情况来决定。据科学研究结果，在这个阶段，禾苗对养分吸收量约占总吸收量的20％左右，吸收比例以磷肥为较高，氮肥和钾肥的比例近似。从早稻结实成熟过程来看，一般从开花授粉到灌浆期结束，约需十二天左右的时间，这是谷粒增重最快的时期。在这个期间如果缺少水分和养分，都会影响谷粒充实。因此，在开始抽穗的时候，对于缺肥的禾苗酌量补充氮肥和钾肥，对促进谷粒充实还会起一定的作用。至于磷肥，可采用喷施的办法，并要根据土壤含磷情况来决定喷磷肥多少。
    早稻在生长后期，外界气候对穗数、粒数和粒重都会发生重要的影响。为此，一方面要加强培养管理，以增强禾苗的抗灾能力；另方面要提高对旱、涝、风等不利气候的警惕，做好防灾的准备。几年来，各地对防旱、防涝积累了丰富的经验，东南沿海地区在防风方面也取得了一些成功经验。为保证早稻丰收，应该很好地运用这些经验，做到防患于未然。
    在后期管理中，防虫防病还是一项重要任务。从南方各地病虫发生情况来看，早稻病虫虽然已被初步压制下去，但为害期还没有过去。必须采取有效措施，不让螟虫造成白穗，不使稻飞虱、浮尘子影响早稻穗胎增大和开花结实，不让穗颈稻瘟露头。
    要把早稻后期管理工作做好，必须让广大群众掌握早稻的生长规律，并且结合各地具体情况找出每一块地当前的关键措施是什么。最近在很多地区领导干部深入下去，抓典型，做样子，突破一点，推动全面。这样做，有效地打破了某些人的“定局”思想，干部群众都认清了早稻后期管理大有可为，真正做到口通、心通、手通，信心十足，干劲猛增。如广西僮族自治区梧州专区的地委、县委第一书记，在前一时期都以大部时间深入下层，深入田间，发现问题，采取措施，因而把全区早稻后期田间管理工作热火朝天地开展起来；不久就消灭三类禾十五万多亩。苍梧县委到新地公社三天，就组织干部、技术员到田间检查禾苗四次，对检查中发现的问题，一面和农民座谈找出解决办法，一面及时指导全县的田间管理工作。这些做法效果很好。
    现在大部分水稻地区距离早稻大熟还有一个来月的时间。大家要与天争时，与地争粮，抓紧时机，抓住关键，把早稻后期田间管理进行到底，力争早稻全面大丰收。
