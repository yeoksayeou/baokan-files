    Improving the Publication and Distribution of Books and Periodicals
    Lu Jialin, Shanghai Normal College

    With the continuous improvement of the cultural level of the broad masses of people and the increasing enrichment of cultural life, the requirements for books and periodicals, in terms of both quality and quantity, are correspondingly increasing. Publishing houses, newspaper and magazine editorial departments, bookstores, post offices, etc. have made great efforts to meet this requirement, which must be affirmed. However, there are still some shortcomings objectively, of course, these shortcomings are produced in the great leap forward of work, and many are inevitable. In order to improve the work and better serve the masses, I think it is necessary for the relevant units to study and consider these shortcomings.
    First, regarding the publication of books and periodicals. Since the launch of the reading movement in many places, the demand for some excellent red books has greatly increased. However, there is a more widespread situation of supply falling short of demand. Readers often rush to the bookstore, but have to return disappointed because they cannot buy the books they need, but newspapers and leaders are still constantly recommending and introducing them. If you wait for a reprint, it will take at least one or two months. Therefore, I think that publishing houses should increase the number of copies printed for "popular books" at the time of the first edition. In addition, there is also a problem of disconnection between publicity and supply. When a central-level publishing house publishes a book (sometimes even before it is published), it generally advertises in newspapers and periodicals in various places, but the book has not been shipped and distributed, which makes readers travel back and forth in vain, and bookstore salespersons are also very embarrassed. In fact, it often takes more than a month for books published in Beijing to be shipped to bookstores in various places for supply. I suggest: For books that are estimated to have a large sales volume, can paper matrices be transported to central cities for separate printing in order to change this situation of "accessible but unattainable"? And it can also reduce the burden on the transportation department. As for the publication of periodicals, I have the following suggestion: Some editorial departments of periodicals delay printing due to their inability to complete the editing work according to plan, thus often delaying the publication time, causing the broad masses of readers to wait all the time. For example, the "Yuhua" semi-monthly magazine published in Nanjing generally takes eight or nine days to be seen in Shanghai, but in fact, it only takes half a day's postal journey to reach here. If it is in a remote area, it will probably be seen even later. This phenomenon of delay must be paid attention to by the editorial department. In this regard, large periodicals such as "People's Literature" have done a better job, and sometimes they can be seen earlier.
    Secondly, regarding the distribution of periodicals. The reason that periodicals cannot be delivered to readers on time is not only due to delayed publication, but also due to certain shortcomings in the post office's transportation, distribution, and delivery work. Generally, the delivery of periodicals is about two or three days slower than ordinary letters, which seems to be too slow. According to post office staff, sometimes the goods arrive at the station, but they are not unloaded and disassembled in time. In addition, subscribers always see the periodicals half a day or a day later than retail buyers, so some subscribers are willing to buy retail rather than subscribe, which will affect planned distribution, so this situation must also be appropriately improved.
    To completely change the above situation, perhaps each unit and department will have certain specific difficulties. However, I think that each must also do its own efforts to try to meet the eager demands of the broad masses of the people.

    改进书刊的出版发行工作
    上海师范学院　陆稼林
    随着广大人民文化水平的不断提高和文化生活的日益丰富，对于书刊方面的要求，就质和量而论，都相应地在日益提高着。出版社、报刊编辑部、书店、邮局等为满足这种要求已经尽了很大的努力，这是必须肯定的。但是，目前客观上也还存在着一些缺点，当然这些缺点是在工作跃进中产生的，而且许多都是不可避免的。为了改进工作，更好地为群众服务，我认为，各有关单位有必要对这些缺点加以研究考虑。
    首先，是关于书刊的出版工作方面。许多地方自从展开读书运动以来，一些优秀的红色书籍的需要量就大为激增。但是目前却有较为普遍的供不应求的状况存在，往往读者兼程赶往书店，结果因为买不到所需要的书只得败兴而归，然而报刊和领导上仍在不断地推荐、介绍。如果等待再版，则最少又需一、二个月之久。所以，我以为出版社对于“热门书”应该在初版时就放大印行数字。另外，还有一个宣传和供应脱节的问题，中央一级出版社一出书（有时甚至还没有出），大抵都在各地报刊登广告，但是书并未运发，致使读者徒劳往返，书店营业员也很为难。而事实上，北京出书后往往要一个多月才能运到各地书店供应。我建议：对于估计有大量销路的书，能否运纸型到各中心城市分别印造，以求改变这种“可望而不可即”的状况。而且也可以使运输部门减轻些负担。至于刊物的出版，我有这样一个意见：有些刊物的编辑部由于不能按计划完成编辑工作而致延迟付印，因此往往拖后出版时间，使广大读者时刻等待。如南京出版的“雨花”半月刊，在上海一般都要过八、九天后才能看到，而事实上只有半天的邮程就能到达这里。如果在偏僻地区，那大概看得更要迟了。这种脱期的现象必须引起编辑部的重视。而这一方面，像“人民文学”等大型期刊就做得比较好，有时还能提早看到。
    其次，关于刊物的发行工作。刊物不能如期送到读者手里，除有的是因为延迟出版以外，邮局在运发、投递工作上也有一定的缺点。大抵期刊的投送要比一般信件慢二、三天左右，这似乎慢得多了些。据邮局营业员称：有时货是到站了，但没有及时地卸拆。此外，订户总要比零售晚半天或一天看到，以致有的订户愿意零购而不愿意订阅，这就要影响到计划发行，所以这种局面也必须予以适当的改进。
    要完全改变上述状况，也许各单位、部门是会有一定具体困难的。但是，我以为也必须各尽自己的努力，以求尽量满足广大人民群众的热切要求。
