South Korean Tour Guide
Tianma Poem, Fang Cheng Drawing

    An American soldier arrives in South Korea.
    An old soldier acts as a guide, leading him everywhere.

    American "ization"
    Look at this Seoul, completely Americanized,
    Eating, drinking, and having fun, no different from home.
    Even better is the freedom, doing whatever you want,
    Grabbing girls on the street, not breaking any laws!

    Robbery
    Why worry about not having money to spend?
    There are plenty of ways,
    With a weapon in hand, who dares disobey!
    Just do it without worry, no need to be afraid,
    The superiors have ordered: everything belongs to us!

    "Go Back"!
    "American troops, go back"! Shouts rise in waves!
    Taking a step and shivering, scared out of their wits!
    It's hard to offend the public's anger, the future looks bleak.
    Hiding in caves at night, don't dare run around!

    Base
    The former granary, where rice and other grains grew everywhere.
    Today it is a base, no one dares trespass.
    The American defense line, stretched so long!
    I'm really worried, I don't know how it will end! (Attached picture)

    南朝鲜导游
    天马诗　方成画一个美国兵，来到南朝鲜。老兵作向导，领着到处转。
    美国“化”你看这汉城，全盘美国化，吃喝与玩乐，不比家乡差。更喜无拘束，想啥就干啥，街上拉姑娘，不犯什么法！
    抢劫何愁没钱花，有的是办法，手中有家伙，谁敢不听话！只管放心干，不用担惊怕，上级有命令：一切都属咱！
    “滚回去”！“美军滚回去”！吼声阵阵高！一步一哆嗦，三魂都吓掉！众怒实难犯，前途很不妙。夜晚洞里藏，千万莫乱跑！
    基地从前是谷仓，遍地种稻粱。今天是基地，没人敢乱闯。美国国防线，拉得这么长！我可真担心，不知咋收场！（附图片）
