Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki wrote a letter on the 8th to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference—Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd—regarding the situation in Laos caused by the Lao government's violation of the Geneva Accords. The letter requested the two chairmen to take measures to promote the resumption of activities by the International Commission in Laos.

The letter stated that, as everyone knows, Poland, as a member of the International Commission for Indochina, opposed the cessation of activities by the International Commission in Laos because it believed that the continued existence of this commission was beneficial to peace in that region.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th dispatch: A delayed dispatch from Vientiane: "Pathet Lao Daily" published on May 9th a letter written by Prince Souphanouvong to Sananikone on April 25th. In the letter, he protested against the Lao government's continuous persecution of former Lao Fighting Force personnel.

In the letter, Prince Souphanouvong stated:

"After my numerous letters to you regarding the incidents of retaliation and discrimination against former Lao Fighting Force personnel that have occurred in various places, such incidents continue to occur in many areas. This makes me very dissatisfied. I cannot remain silent in the face of such brutal actions."

The letter pointed out that at the end of March this year, the authorities of Attapeu province arrested former Lao Fighting Force personnel Nai Tham, Nai Chuan, Nai Lien, Nai Soulima, Nai Kham, Nai Lin, Nai Deng, and Nai Chanlu. They are still being imprisoned in Attapeu province. Also in March, former Lao Fighting Force personnel Nai Thida and Nai Chuan Tet were murdered in Bai Township, Lao Ngam District, Saravane Province.

In the letter, Prince Souphanouvong requested the Sananikone government to investigate the above incidents and give the perpetrators due punishment, while also investigating and handling the arrests, and immediately releasing those who are innocent.

According to a report by "Pathet Lao Daily" on May 16th, the Sananikone government, using "defense" as an excuse, ordered the military police on May 13th to surround the residences of Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, Phoumi Vongvichit, Member of the Luang Prabang Provincial Council, Nouhak Phoumsavan, Member of the Sam Neua Provincial Council, Sithon Kommadam, Member of the Saravane Provincial Council, and the central office of the Lao Patriotic Party in Vientiane.

"Pathet Lao Daily" pointed out that the Sananikone government insists that this "defense" action is for the purpose of "maintaining security." In reality, this is a surveillance and control action taken by the government against the leaders of the Patriotic Party. What will follow will be even more blatant discrimination and retaliation against personnel from the former Lao Fighting Forces.

"Pathet Lao Daily" condemned the Sananikone government's behavior as detrimental to the country and the nation, and pointed out that it would cause huge losses and make the situation in Laos even more serious. The newspaper finally requested the Sananikone government to hold talks with the Lao Patriotic Party to resolve mutual disputes.

    波兰外长写信给日内瓦会议两位主席
    要求促使老挝国际委员会恢复活动
    苏发努冯抗议老挝当局不断迫害前寮国战斗部队人员
    新华社9日讯　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰外交部长腊帕茨基8日就老挝政府违反日内瓦协议而在老挝造成的局势写信给日内瓦会议的两位主席——苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德。信中要求两位主席采取措施，促使老挝国际委员会恢复活动。
    这封信说，大家知道，波兰作为印度支那国际委员会的一个成员国是反对老挝国际委员会停止活动的。因为，它认为，这个委员会的继续存在是有利于那个地区的和平的。
    新华社河内8日电　万象迟到消息：“老挝爱国报”5月9日发表了苏发努冯亲王在4月25日写给萨纳尼空的一封信。信中抗议老挝政府不断迫害前寮国战斗部队人员。
    苏发努冯亲王在这封信中说：
  “在我多次就各地所发生的对前寮国战斗部队人员的报复、歧视事件写信给你之后，许多地方仍然在继续发生这类事件。这使我非常不满。在这种残暴的行动面前，我不能忍气吞声。”
    信中指出，今年3月底，阿速坡省当局逮捕了前寮国战斗部队人员乃探、乃川、乃连、乃苏里马、乃堪、乃林、乃登和乃占禄，直到现在，他们仍然被监禁在阿速坡省。也是在3月间，在沙拉湾省老银县白乡的前寮国战斗部队人员乃梯达和乃川特被杀害。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中要求萨纳尼空政府调查上述事件，并给凶犯以应有的惩治，同时调查和处理逮捕事件，立即释放那些无辜的人。
  据“老挝爱国报”5月16日报道，萨纳尼空政府5月13日以“保卫”作借口，命令军警包围老挝爱国党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王、琅勃拉邦省议员富米·冯维西、桑怒省议员努哈·丰沙旺、沙拉湾省议员西吞等的住宅以及设立在万象的老挝爱国党中央办公厅。
    “老挝爱国报”指出，萨纳尼空政府硬说这种“保卫”行动是为了“维护安全”，实际上，这是政府采取的对爱国党领导人的监视和管制行动，随着而来的必将是对前寮国战斗部部的人员更明目张胆地进行歧视和报复。
    “老挝爱国报”指责萨纳尼空政府这种不利于国家和民族的行为，并指出，它将造成巨大的损失，使老挝的局势更加严重。报纸最后要求萨纳尼空政府同老挝爱国党举行会谈，以解决互相间的纠纷。
