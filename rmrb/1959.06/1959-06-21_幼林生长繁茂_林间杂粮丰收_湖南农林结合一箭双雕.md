Young Forests Grow Luxuriantly, Intercropped Grains Yield Abundantly
Hunan Combines Agriculture and Forestry for a Double Harvest

(Reported by this newspaper) Hunan Province is adopting methods that combine forestry and agricultural production to comprehensively expand the nurturing and protection of young forests, striving for even greater harvests in both forestry and grain production. Currently, 150,000 people throughout the province are going up the mountains daily to engage in intercropping and nurturing young forests. According to statistics reported on June 15th, the province has already nurtured 3.27 million mu of young forests, of which over 2.3 million mu are intercropped with agricultural crops.

In mountainous and hilly areas of Hunan, the practice of intercropping grains within forests is common. Last year, the province's intercropping area expanded from over one million mu to over five million mu, yielding over 600 million jin of various grains. At the same time, through cultivation, weeding, and fertilization, the young forests were also nurtured, promoting rapid tree growth. In Huitong County, the 8,000+ mu of forest land intercropped with grains on Jinlong Mountain not only produced abundant grains, but also saw particularly lush growth of young forests, with an average survival rate of 95%. The young trees are generally over one chi tall, with the tallest reaching two chi. This year, many areas here continued to focus on intercropping after spring planting and afforestation. As soon as rice transplanting ended in Anhua County, 4,500 laborers were mobilized, forming 387 specialized teams to vigorously engage in intercropping and young forest nurturing. Currently, the county has completed intercropping and nurturing on 125,000 mu of land. Yuanling County also allocated the tasks of intercropping and young forest nurturing to the communes after rice transplanting, and through discussions at cadre meetings and mass meetings at all levels, developed plans. In this production effort, the county mobilized over 26,900 people, organized over 1,500 specialized teams, and by May 20th, had already completed nurturing young forests and intercropping on over 183,000 mu. In addition, Ningxiang, Cili, Linxiang, Zhijiang and other counties are also vigorously carrying out this work.

To ensure that intercropping and young forest nurturing are carried out meticulously and practically, many communes here have adopted corresponding measures. The Zhangjiaping branch commune in Yuanling universally adopted the "five ups to the mountain" (dining hall, labor force, draught cattle, office, and cadres go up the mountain) and the "five guarantees" (guarantee grain sowing, guarantee young tree replanting, guarantee young tree growth into forests, guarantee sowing specifications, guarantee grain harvesting) and the "six determinations" (determine leaders, determine labor, determine tasks, determine location, determine specifications, determine time) methods, ensuring the quantity and quality of forest-grain intercropping. Guanshi Commune in Hengyang County used the past experience of only planting trees without nurturing, resulting in low survival rates, to educate cadres and the masses. Everyone cared about forest cultivation and protection, and everyone took action, forming a high tide of young forest nurturing. Tree cultivation groups were established in both the brigade and production team, and specific people were assigned to manage each mountain, establishing a cultivation and nurturing system, implementing three guarantees (guarantee nurturing time, cultivation frequency, pest and disease forecasting), and five determinations (determine personnel, determine area, determine work point remuneration, determine survival rate targets, determine reward and punishment conditions). Now, most economic forests have been cultivated twice, and timber forests have been cultivated once, with seedlings growing well and foliage lush. According to inspection, the survival rate of pine and fir here reached 95.6%, oil tea and tung oil reached 80%, and citrus and walnuts reached 92.3%. In the process of intercropping and nurturing young forests in Anhua County, communes and brigades launched a five-comparison competition: comparing progress, comparing quality, comparing quantity, comparing work efficiency, and comparing cadre experimental mountains. The Yuanshuiping Brigade of Guangming Commune in Yuanling County adopted methods such as nurturing and intercropping on the mountains, improving tools, and appropriately allocating labor, enabling a smaller number of people to do more work, equivalent to adding 3,890 workdays.

    幼林生长繁茂　林间杂粮丰收
    湖南农林结合一箭双雕
    本报讯　湖南省各地采取林业和农业生产相结合的办法，全面展开了幼林抚育保护工作，争取林业生产和粮食生产同时获得更大丰收。目前全省每天有十五万人上山，进行农林间作、抚育幼林。据6月15日的汇报统计，全省已经抚育幼林面积达到三百二十七万亩，其中施行农林间作的有二百三十多万亩。
    湖南各地山区和丘陵地区都有林粮间作习惯。去年全省林粮间作面积由一百多万亩扩大到五百多万亩，收获各种杂粮六亿多斤；同时通过中耕除草和追肥，也抚育了幼林，促进林木快速生长。会同县金龙山林粮间作的八千多亩林地，不仅杂粮丰收了，而且幼林也生长得特别茂盛，平均成活率达到95％，幼林一般高达一尺多，最高的达到二尺。今年这里的许多地区继续在春种和春季造林之后，抓紧进行林粮间作。安化县插秧刚一结束，就抽调了四千五百个劳动力，组成三百八十七个专业队，大搞林粮间作和幼林抚育。目前全县已完成林粮间作和抚育的面积有十二万五千亩。沅陵县也在插秧完毕后，将林粮间作和抚育幼林任务分配到社，并通过干部会、群众会层层讨论，制订计划，这个县在这项生产中，出动了二万六千九百多人，组织一千五百多个专业队，到5月20日就已经完成抚育幼林并间作粮食作物十八万三千多亩。另外，宁乡、慈利、临湘、芷江等县也都在大力开展这一工作。
    为了使林粮间作和幼林抚育工作做得细致踏实，这里的许多公社都采取了相应的措施。沅陵张家坪分社各大队普遍采取“五上山”（食堂、劳力、耕牛、办公、干部上山）和包杂粮播种、包幼林补蔸、包幼树成林、包播种规格、包杂粮收割以及定领导、定劳力、定任务、定地点、定规格、定时间的“五包”、“六定”办法，保证了林、粮间作的数量和质量。衡阳县关市公社用往年只造林、不抚育、成活率低的事实，教育了干部和群众后，人人关心育林、护林，大家动手，形成抚育幼林的高潮。大队、生产队都成立了育林小组，每个山头确定了专人看管，建立了中耕、培育制度，实行三包（包培育时间、中耕次数、病虫害预报）、五定（定人、定面积、定工分报酬、定成活率指标、定奖罚条件）。现在，大部分经济林已中耕两次，用材林中耕了一次，幼苗生长良好，枝叶茂密。据检查，这里的松杉成活率达到95.6％，油茶、油桐达到80％，柑桔、核桃达到92.3％。安化县在进行林粮间作和抚育幼林中，社和社、队和队开展了比进度、比质量、比数量、比工效、比干部试验山的五比竞赛。沅陵县光明公社远水坪大队，采取坐山抚育、间作，改良工具，适当搭配劳动力等办法，用较少的人多做了许多工作，相当于增加了三千八百九十个工。
