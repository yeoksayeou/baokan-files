On the Division of Labor Between Manual and Mental Labor
Li Wen

I. The Emergence and Elimination of the Division of Labor Between Manual and Mental Labor

From the viewpoint of historical materialism, the difference and division of labor between manual and mental labor are not eternal. This difference and division emerged in the process of social development, and it will also disappear in the future development of society. The emergence of the division of labor between manual and mental labor has its historical reasons and necessary conditions, and the elimination of this division in the future is also reasonable and inevitable.

Labor in primitive society was simple. The production tools at that time were still very primitive, mainly just some crude stone tools, bows and arrows, clubs, etc. Primitive people engaged in hunting, fishing, animal husbandry, and gathering fruits. At that time, the level of productivity was very low, and everyone had to work from morning to night to barely maintain their most basic needs. Labor products were distributed equally, and there was no surplus.

The development of productive forces led to the division of labor, and the division of labor led to exchange. The differentiation of nomadic tribes was the first large-scale social division of labor, and nomadic and agricultural tribes established economic ties through exchange. Later, production tools were further improved, and handicrafts such as weaving, blacksmithing, and pottery gradually developed, and then the second large-scale social division of labor occurred - the separation of handicrafts and agriculture. In the primitive commune, there were initially certain common interests, and some public affairs were handled to protect these interests, such as resolving disputes, preventing individual overreach, and certain religious functions. This type of work was undertaken by individual members. The development of the division of labor and the expansion of exchange gradually disintegrated the clan commune and destroyed the system of public ownership. Different interests arose within the commune. Chiefs and patriarchs gradually used their positions to make fortunes and enrich themselves, turning communal property into their private property. These people holding public office gradually broke away from the collective and lorded over the collective. This is one aspect of the process of class formation. On the other hand, due to the development of production, one person's labor could produce a little surplus beyond what was needed to feed himself, thus exploitation became possible. Relatively wealthy and powerful families kept captives obtained in wars as slaves. With the development of the slave system, the first class-exploitative society appeared.

At this time, the separation of manual and mental labor also appeared. The cultural knowledge of primitive society was very immature. Although primitive labor also required some thought and some mental activity, the main form of labor at that time was manual labor. Although there was some mental labor in individual places, generally speaking, mental labor was still very undeveloped and basically in its infancy. The reasons for the emergence of the division of labor between manual and mental labor and the relationship between this division and the class system are as follows: the development of productive forces in primitive society and the resulting social division of labor inevitably led to the emergence of classes; at the same time, the development of productive forces also led to the need for specialized mental labor, and the emergence of classes made the realization of this need possible. Before the emergence of classes, mental labor was basically only in a semi-independent embryonic form, and managers and religious practitioners were generally not or only semi-detached from production. After the emergence of classes, the exploiting class was able to transfer the manual labor that they would have had to do themselves to the exploited class, thus gaining the leisure to engage in specialized mental labor, making the separation of manual and mental labor possible. The further development of production levels and the division of labor within class society made independent mental labor even more necessary. In this way, mental labor separated from manual labor and differentiated itself.

Engels said: "When the total amount of social labor barely provides a surplus beyond what is absolutely necessary for the bare existence of all; when, therefore, labor engages all or nearly all the time of the great majority of the members of society—then this society is necessarily divided into classes. Side by side with the great majority, exclusively bond slaves to labor, there grows up a class freed from directly productive labor, which looks after the general affairs of society: the direction of labor, State affairs, law, science, art, etc." ("Anti-Dühring")

Therefore, the division of labor between manual and mental labor and the opposition between the exploited and exploiting classes are both caused by the development of productivity levels. The need for the division of labor between manual and mental labor provided a certain historical justification for the emergence of the class system, and the emergence of the class system provided a form for the realization of the division of labor between manual and mental labor. Engels has already pointed out the relationship between the two in "Anti-Dühring." He said: "The law of division of labor lies at the basis of the division into classes" (note: Engels here refers to the division of labor between manual and mental labor), therefore, "the division of classes has a certain historical justification"; in addition, he called slavery the "simplest, most primitive form of this division of labor." In the discussion, some comrades believe that "the opposition and separation of manual and mental labor are created by the exploiting class in order to more cruelly exploit the working people," which is of course incorrect, because this statement exaggerates the role of the subjective will of the exploiting class and does not see that this separation has its objective needs and inevitability. Of course, the separation of manual and mental labor cannot be explained without considering the process of class formation; historically, the separation of manual and mental labor could only be thoroughly realized in the form of the class system.

This division of labor brought great progress in history, but also produced serious evils.

First, this division of labor made large-scale collective labor possible. Large-scale labor collaboration requires specialized organizers and commanders, and the exploiters took on such a role. This type of labor organization undoubtedly played a role in increasing productivity. Ancient countries such as Egypt, India, China, Greece, and Rome have left us some magnificent architectural remains to this day. These achievements would not have been possible without large-scale slave labor. Since manual labor and mental labor are in a relationship of domination and being dominated, and the exploiting class "never misses an opportunity to pile an ever-increasing load of labor on the shoulders of the working masses for their own benefit" (Engels), then it is natural that manual labor becomes a heavy burden for the exploited class. The ability of a few privileged people to display their talents comes at the cost of the majority of exploited working masses losing the opportunity to develop their own intelligence and talents.

Second, this division of labor enables mental laborers to specialize in mental activities and develop culture, art, and science. Engels once said that without slavery, there would be no culture of ancient Greece and Rome. However, this division of labor also brought disadvantages to the development of culture and science. Most intellectuals attached themselves to the ruling class, thus separating themselves from labor, from the people, and from the source of culture and science. In the history of class society, idealism has basically been dominant, one of the reasons for this is the separation of manual and mental labor and the domination of the former over the latter.

Third, since the ruling class monopolizes spiritual wealth, they use all cultural and scientific achievements to serve themselves. They not only carry out economic exploitation of the working people, but also use various ideologies to carry out spiritual oppression of the working people. In capitalist society, every invention of science and technology not only does not reduce the burden of workers, but becomes a new weapon for capitalists to attack workers. The ruling class enlists a group of intellectuals, and they not only separate themselves from manual labor, but also gradually separate themselves from mental labor. The reactionary ruling class is increasingly becoming the enemy of civilization and increasingly hindering the healthy development of science and art. In capitalist countries, a cultural crisis has generally appeared.

Thus, in capitalist society, the antagonism between manual and mental labor has developed to its peak. Then, things turned to their opposite: the division of manual and mental labor, which originally promoted the development of production and developed on the basis of class antagonism, has now become an obstacle to the further development of production. The separation of manual and mental labor was originally a product of the development of production levels, which were somewhat developed but not developed enough, from the perspective of the entire history of mankind. When social productivity increases immeasurably and science and technology make leapfrog progress, these two forms of labor will inevitably need to be combined.

Capitalist society has sharpened the opposition between manual and mental labor, and at the same time it has prepared the conditions for eliminating the opposition between manual and mental labor.

Since the separation of manual and mental labor stems from relatively low production levels and class division, then in a communist society that has both eliminated classes and has much higher productivity than it does now, manual and mental labor will be merged into one. After the abolition of class exploitation, the high development of productive forces is the fundamental condition for eliminating the difference between manual and mental labor, because:

1. The hallmark of highly developed productive forces is a high degree of mechanization and automation, which on the one hand will reduce the manual labor of producers to a minimum, and on the other hand will require producers to be familiar with the entire production process and master rich scientific and technological knowledge;

2. The high-speed development of production constantly creates new imbalances, and new production departments will also continue to emerge. "The nature of large-scale industry, the alteration of labor, variation of functions, the mobility of the laborer himself" (Marx). Therefore, it creates the need to overcome the one-sidedness of each person, to be able to transfer from one production department to another according to social needs or their own hobbies, and to fully develop their talents in all aspects. Such people, of course, must master more aspects of knowledge;

3. The above two points say that the high development of productive forces requires the comprehensive development of producers, but the high development of productive forces also makes it possible to universally cultivate such comprehensive talents. Due to the unparalleled increase in labor productivity, the necessary labor time for each person to engage in the production of material means of subsistence can be greatly shortened, so that each person has ample time to engage in cultural, scientific, and artistic activities, and cultivate themselves into laborers with a high level of cultural knowledge who have both broad knowledge and specialized skills.

Due to the development of science and technology, machines are gradually replacing various manual labors of people. Many manual labors that people thought could not be replaced in the past now have newly invented machines to replace them. We still see no end to this aspect. Therefore, the view that even in communist society it is still mainly manual labor is not appropriate. Now there are even machines that manage machines and replace part of mental labor - fast electronic computers. In communist society, the manual labor that people need to engage in will be greatly reduced and alleviated compared to what it is now, and the form of manual labor at that time will also undergo great changes, and the boundary between manual labor and mental labor will disappear. Future labor is such labor: it replaces the heavy, monotonous manual labor with machines, so that labor is no longer a heavy burden and makes people tired. At the same time, every kind of labor requires intellectual activity and requires the application of scientific and technological knowledge. At that time, machines will be multi-faceted slaves of people, and people will increasingly engage in creative labor that requires wisdom, because only creative labor cannot be replaced by machines. At that time, people will still be tense when they work, but labor will no longer limit people, but will be a means of liberating people, no longer a heavy burden, but an "element of joy" and "the first need of life."

II. Striving to Narrow the Distance Between Manual Laborers and Mental Laborers

In our country, since liberation, the relationship between manual laborers and mental laborers has entered a new historical stage. The Party and the state have carried out tremendous transformation and education work on the old intellectuals, so that the intellectuals have turned to serving the people. Old ideas that belittle manual labor, belittle workers and peasants, and reflect the interests of the exploiting class have been criticized. All valuable achievements in culture and science are used to benefit the people. Now our country has achieved great victories in the socialist revolution on the economic front, political front, and ideological front, and the socialist system has been basically established, and the antagonistic contradictions between mental labor and manual labor in the old society have also been basically eliminated. Of course, this antagonistic contradiction has not been completely eliminated. For example, the contradiction between bourgeois right-wing intellectuals and the working people is antagonistic. As for within the people, the contradiction between mental laborers and manual laborers still exists. It is manifested in the fact that the cultural and technical level of the majority of manual laborers is still far behind that of mental laborers; mental laborers still have a more or less large distance from manual laborers in terms of thoughts and feelings; intellectuals still only account for a small part of the people in our country, and some of them have not yet solved or have not solved well the problem of integrating with workers and peasants. This is the remnant of the old division of labor left over from the old society, which cannot be eliminated in a short time and can only be eliminated in communist society.

Then, how can we gradually combine mental labor and manual labor to eliminate the difference between the two? We said earlier that the fundamental problem depends on the development of social productivity. Only when social productivity is highly developed, for example, when the national economy departments, especially industrial and agricultural production, are mechanized, automated, electrified, and chemicalized, will social products be greatly enriched, so that the intensity of labor can be greatly reduced, the time of labor can be shortened, and the living conditions of the people can be improved..., so that the working people can have more time to engage in learning and quickly improve their cultural and scientific and technical knowledge. At this time, the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural differences, and the differences between mental labor and manual labor that still have to be preserved in the socialist period will gradually disappear. It should be particularly pointed out that the role that our people's communes will play here is that "it points out for our people the road of gradual industrialization of the countryside, the road of gradual transition from collective ownership in agriculture to ownership by the whole people, the road of gradual transition from socialist 'distribution according to work' (i.e., payment according to labor) to communist 'distribution according to needs' (i.e., each according to his needs), the road of gradually narrowing and even eliminating the differences between town and country, between worker and peasant, and between mental and manual labor, and the road of gradually reducing and even eliminating the internal functions of the state." (Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes)

However, eliminating the difference between mental labor and manual labor requires a relatively long process. At present, we need to actively prepare conditions for realizing the elimination of this difference. According to our country's experience, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that on the one hand, it is necessary to implement universal education and gradually improve the cultural and technical level of the working people, so that the workers and peasants become intellectualized; on the other hand, it is necessary to make the intellectuals go to the workers and peasants to be tempered, especially to participate in the tempering of manual labor, to break the bourgeois ideology, and to make the intellectuals laborized. Of course, the participation of mental laborers in manual labor now is not the combination of the two labors, nor does it equal the combination form of the two labors in the future, but only makes the feelings of intellectuals closer to the workers and peasants, transforms the old ideology, strengthens labor tempering, and shortens the distance between the two aspects. We also need to carry out cultural revolution and technical revolution, and through the process of mechanization and electrification, we can change the heavy manual labor and gradually realize the combination of the two labors. Without the rise of culture and the great development of productive forces, there is no talk of the real combination of the two labors. Now some people think that the cultural revolution only refers to the workers and peasants learning culture, which is a misunderstanding. In fact, not only the workers and peasants should learn culture, but also the intellectuals should work hard to study, read books carefully, and constantly increase knowledge. The cultural revolution is not only a problem of popularization, but also a problem of improvement; it is not only a problem of quantity, but also a problem of improving quality.

Our country is still a "poor and blank" country, the cultural level of the workers and peasants is still very low, there are still many illiterate people, and primary education is not universal enough. In order to build socialism and communism, we urgently need to improve the cultural and technical level of the working people. We need to conduct literacy campaigns throughout the country, popularize primary education, and gradually achieve the popularization of secondary education. In this regard, we have made great achievements. According to Premier Zhou's recent government work report at the National People's Congress, the number of primary school students reached 86 million in 1958, the spare-time education of workers and peasants developed rapidly, and the literacy work also made great progress.

In strengthening the labor tempering of intellectuals, our party and government have also taken a series of measures, such as: leaders at all levels participating in a certain period of manual labor, sending cadres to lower levels to conduct labor tempering, "generals acting as soldiers," "factory directors acting as workers," and "commune cadres acting as commune members," implementing the policy of serving proletarian politics in education, and combining education with productive labor, etc., which have promoted the laborization of intellectuals and shortened the distance between the thoughts and feelings of mental laborers and manual laborers. The practice of more than a year has proved that this policy is correct. Many intellectuals, due to being sent to lower levels for tempering and due to participating in manual labor, have caused changes in their thoughts and feelings, enhanced their labor viewpoint and mass viewpoint, increased their knowledge of production struggle, and moved a step forward in the direction of combining theory and practice. Labor tempering has also helped cadres overcome the three styles and five airs, improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, and change some bureaucratic styles of work in organs that are divorced from reality and from the masses, so that they can discover and solve problems in production and work in a timely manner, thereby strengthening the specific leadership for industrial and agricultural production and greatly improving the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of laboring people. The practice of the past year has also proved that because we have implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, the face of our schools has been renewed. The current schools have gradually become bases for cultivating new types of talents that integrate teaching, production, and scientific research. All types of full-time and part-time schools have included productive labor as a formal course, and students read books on the one hand and work on the other hand, and practically and effectively participate in various productive labors. The ideological awareness of the broad masses of teachers and students has made great progress in labor tempering, and the quality of teaching has also been significantly improved. In this way, students can develop comprehensively in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education, so that they can become "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture."

However, all of the above does not indicate that manual labor and mental labor have been completely combined, and the boundary between the two has disappeared. The elimination of the division of labor between manual labor and mental labor and the real integration of the two can only be realized on the basis of a high degree of mechanization, electrification, and automation. This is our ideal for communist society. Now we do not have the conditions to realize this ideal and can only work hard to prepare and create these conditions. As far as the current situation is concerned, the division of labor between manual labor and mental labor is still necessary and cannot be denied. We oppose both viewing this division as eternal and unchanging and immediately abolishing this division.

III. Comment on Certain Erroneous Arguments in the Discussion

Comrade Wei Gao believes that "people engaged in mental labor do not need to participate in manual labor, and too much manual labor will hinder their mental development." This sentence is worth studying. Comrade Wei Gao only said that "too much" manual labor will hinder mental development, then what if it is not "too much"? Comrade Wei Gao did not say this, but he does not advocate reducing too much manual labor, but advocates "not participating in manual labor." We believe that if the time spent participating in manual labor is really too much, so that the study time is too little, it is indeed hindering. But it cannot be said that manual labor itself hinders mental development. On the contrary, from the perspective of human history, Engels has long proved that the labor of the hands promotes the development of the brain. Mental laborers completely getting rid of manual labor, although it once played a progressive role in history, also brought disadvantages to mental laborers because of the neglect of the aspect of production practice. This is what we explained earlier. Today, students participating in manual labor is of great benefit to their moral, intellectual, and physical aspects. Socialism and communism need people who are both red and expert and develop in an all-round way, and the participation of mental laborers in some manual labor is one of the important measures taken to cultivate this new type of person. First of all, participating in manual labor can change the thoughts and feelings of intellectuals, enable them to appreciate the hardship and greatness of labor, temper their will and character, cultivate their love for labor, love for the collective, and love for the working people, and improve their communist awareness. Today, the majority of workers and peasants in China are engaged in manual labor; if intellectuals are completely divorced from manual labor, then their thoughts and feelings cannot be integrated with the workers and peasants; if cadres are completely divorced from manual labor, it is often difficult for them to be familiar with the masses, go deep into the masses, and discover problems in their work. We say that we want to serve the people. If we are not even familiar with the objects of service and are isolated from them in life, how can we serve them well? Moreover, participating in manual labor can also greatly enrich the practical production knowledge of intellectuals who are "not diligent in their limbs and do not distinguish between the five grains" and is beneficial to their physical health. Although intellectuals are known to have knowledge, they are mainly just knowledge from books. If we talk about the situation in the countryside and factories and the knowledge of productive labor, then intellectuals are often the most ignorant. Therefore, is participating in productive labor not a good opportunity to learn this knowledge? Is it not a good opportunity to help intellectuals combine book knowledge with practical knowledge? Of course, for the participation of intellectuals, cadres, and students in labor, it is necessary to make good arrangements so that their manual labor is combined with their specialties as much as possible (we say "combined as much as possible" because if everyone requires that every labor they participate in is combined with their specialty, then it is impossible at present). In addition, the time occupied should also be appropriately stipulated. Sometimes the arrangements are not proper and the implementation is not good, and it can indeed hinder professional learning. This aspect of the problem needs to be studied, the experience of the past year should be summarized, and improvements should be made. But in principle, the participation of intellectuals in manual labor is beneficial, necessary, and cannot be shaken.

Comrade Wei Gao also believes that "there will still be geniuses in communist society, and there is no need to ask geniuses to do work that they are not good at, otherwise, it will bury the genius." Of course, there will still be geniuses in communist society, not only will there be, but there will be very many. Communist society is a society that produces geniuses. Where do geniuses come from? They come from the masses. There are many geniuses among the working people, but in the old era, they were toiling for a living all their lives and did not get the opportunity to be trained and educated, so their intelligence and talents could not be fully developed. There were also many geniuses among the intellectuals in the old era, but many geniuses were greatly restricted or developed in the wrong direction due to being divorced from the people and being bound by class prejudices. The fixed division of labor between manual and mental labor in the old style has played an unfavorable role in the development of the talents of both manual laborers and mental laborers. Only in communist society, where the difference between manual labor and mental labor is eliminated in the future, will all possibilities be provided for the comprehensive and high development of people. Of course, we also disagree with Comrade Fu Youren's view when refuting Comrade Wei Gao's argument that in communist society, "everyone is a theorist, scientist, inventor, writer, singer." This is also a misunderstanding of labor in future society. In communist society, the division of labor left over from the old system (the division of labor between urban and rural areas, the division of labor between mental labor and manual labor, the division of labor between skilled labor and unskilled labor, and the division of labor between heavy labor and easy labor) will be eliminated, the development of science and technology requires people to have broad cultural and technical knowledge and a variety of labor skills, the suffering of being bound to a profession for life will be completely eliminated, and everyone will be free and comprehensively developed. But this does not mean that people will master all specialized skills, nor does it mean that everyone must achieve the same achievements in every department. In the future, key knowledge and skills are still needed, and everyone will be both broad and specialized. It is conceivable that it is impossible for a person to be equally proficient in all sciences and technologies. Marx and Engels once pointed out that in communist society, not everyone is Raphael, but everyone like Raphael has every possibility to develop their talents fully without restriction. In communist society, the division of labor and specialties will still exist. However, that will have a new nature.

Of course, some people master certain abilities faster and better. This may be related to certain innate characteristics (qualities) of human anatomy, physiology, and the central nervous system. However, this characteristic only provides the premise for the development of ability, and it still needs to be developed in the process of education and teaching. Moreover, ability is only one of the important conditions to ensure the success of activities, and it is not the only condition to ensure the success of activities. The results of completing an activity depend not only on ability, but also on a series of other conditions, especially on people's world view. For a person with a talent in a certain aspect, if he is only taught knowledge in a certain aspect, but no cultivation is given to other aspects, especially communist viewpoints and beliefs, then he will still be unable to contribute creative achievements to the revolutionary cause. Our current advocacy of participating in manual labor also plays a major role in establishing a communist world view. Moreover, the appropriate participation of mental laborers in some manual labor is not a change of career. If certain professions (such as certain artistic performances) are indeed affected by participating in certain labor, then appropriate arrangements can be made to solve it.

Comrade Ren Wei believes that "eliminating the major difference between manual labor and mental labor is not a matter of having college students with a certain scientific and cultural level engage in labor unrelated to their own business, but of improving the scientific and cultural knowledge of workers and peasants, that is to say, it is not a matter of pulling the high down, but it should be the low catering to the high." What is called "high"? What is called "low"? This can have different understandings. "All other occupations are inferior, only studying is high," this is one understanding. However, this is an old and also an erroneous view. According to our view, it is of course valuable for mental laborers to have more knowledge. However, Lenin once pointed out: "Only by integrating with the workers and peasants in labor can one become a true communist." ("The Tasks of the Youth Leagues") The contempt for and detachment from manual labor by mental laborers is itself a manifestation of a lack of communist consciousness. What we need are cadres who are both red and expert. From the point of view of the degree of "redness," many intellectuals are far below the level of workers and peasants. Therefore, advocating the laborization of intellectuals is not "pulling the high down," but "pulling the low up." Even from the perspective of knowledge, if it refers to book knowledge, intellectuals are of course more knowledgeable than workers and peasants, as for practical perceptual knowledge, it is not as good as workers and peasants. Therefore, intellectuals can also increase knowledge in labor. Chairman Mao said: "What is the way to turn this kind of person who only has book knowledge into a veritable intellectual? The only way is to make them participate in practical work and become practical workers." Participating in labor is also participating in the practice of production struggle. Mental laborers who are divorced from life and practice are, in a certain sense, not "high," but precisely "low."

Of course, manual laborers have practical experience, but lack rational knowledge, and their knowledge is also relatively incomplete, which is a weakness. In particular, economic progress and the development of science and technology require people who have both skilled skills and rich cultural and technical knowledge. This requires them to quickly master modern cultural and technical knowledge. In addition, the knowledge of mental laborers also needs to continue to improve, and we cannot despise book learning and the improvement of business because of emphasizing participation in manual labor. We also said this earlier.

Editor's Note

The discussion on the division of labor between mental and manual labor has been going on for several months, and 18 articles have been published so far. Most of the articles in the past discussions have talked about the importance of manual labor, the inevitability of the future integration of mental and manual labor, and the necessity of intellectuals participating in manual labor; however, the importance of mental labor, the necessity of the division of labor and cooperation between mental and manual labor in socialist construction, the importance of the working people learning scientific and cultural knowledge, the fact that intellectuals must continue to improve themselves, and that a scientific and cultural upsurge must be launched to build socialism has been talked about very little or not at all. In order to make this discussion more in-depth, more comprehensive, and more closely integrated with the current socialist construction, we plan to continue to publish several articles on these aspects, and hope that readers can continue to express their opinions on various aspects of this issue.

专栏：关于体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工问题的讨论

    关于体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工问题
    理文
    一、体力劳动和脑力劳动分工的产生和消灭
    从历史唯物主义的观点看来，体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别和分工不是永恒的。这种差别和分工是在社会发展过程中产生的，它也将在社会未来的发展过程中归于消灭。体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工的产生有它的历史的理由，有它的必然条件，而这种分工在将来的消灭也是合理的，必然的。
    原始社会的劳动是简单的。那时的生产工具还是很原始的东西，主要不过是一些粗笨的石器、弓箭、棍棒等。原始人从事狩猎、捕鱼、驯养动物、搜集果实。那时生产力水平十分低下，每个人都必须从早到晚地劳动才能勉强维持他的最基本的需要，劳动产品是平均分配的，没有什么剩余。
    生产力的发展引起了分工，分工又引起了交换。游牧部落的分化出来是第一次大规模的社会分工，游牧部落和农业部落是通过交换来建立经济联系的。以后，生产工具进一步改善，纺织、打铁、陶器等等手工业逐渐发展起来，于是又发生了第二次大规模的社会分工——手工业和农业分离了。在原始公社中，最初有着一定的共同的利益，为保护这种利益就有一些公共的事务，例如解决争端，制止个人越权，以及某些宗教职能等，这一类工作是由个别成员来担当的。分工的发展和交换的扩大逐渐瓦解了氏族公社，破坏了公有制。公社内部产生了不同的利益。酋长和族长逐渐利用自己的地位来发财致富，把公社的财产变为自己私有。这些担任公职的人逐渐脱离集体，凌驾于集体之上。这是形成阶级的过程的一个方面。另一方面，由于生产的发展，一个人的劳动生产出来的东西，在养活他自己以外还可以有一点剩余，这样，剥削就有了可能。比较富有的和有势力的家庭就把战争中获得的俘虏保留下来，作为奴隶。奴隶制度发展起来，就出现了第一个阶级剥削的社会。
    在这时也就出现了体力劳动和脑力劳动的分离。原始社会的文化知识是很幼稚的，原始劳动虽然也要用一些思想，有一些脑力的活动，但那时劳动的主要形态是体力劳动，个别的地方虽然有一些脑力劳动，但一般地说，脑力劳动还很不发展，基本上处于萌芽的状态中。脑力劳动和体力劳动分工产生的原因以及这个分工和阶级制度的关系是这样的：原始社会生产力的发展以及由此而来的社会分工必然引起阶级的产生；同时，生产力的发展也引起了专门从事脑力劳动的需要，而阶级的出现就使得这种需要的实现成为可能。在阶级出现以前，脑力劳动基本上还只有半独立的萌芽形式，管理人员和宗教事务者一般也是不脱产或半脱产的。在阶级出现以后，由于剥削阶级能够把本来要自己从事的体力劳动转到被剥削阶级身上，这才获得了进行专门的脑力劳动的闲暇，使得体力劳动和脑力劳动的分离成为可能。阶级社会内生产水平和分工的进一步发展，又使独立的脑力劳动更加成为必要。这样，脑力劳动就脱离体力劳动而分化出来了。
    恩格斯说：“当社会劳动的生产总量用来供应社会全体所最必需的生活资料以外难得有所剩余的时候，当劳动差不多占据着社会极大多数人的全部和差不多全部时间的时候，这时候，这个社会必然分成各个阶级。在这个完全从事于不自由劳动的极大多数人之旁，形成着一个脱离直接生产劳动的阶级，它从事于社会的这样一些共同事务：劳动的管理、国家事务、司法、科学、艺术等等。”（“反杜林论”）
    所以，体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工，被剥削阶级和剥削阶级的对立，这两者都是由生产力水平的发展引起的。体力劳动和脑力劳动分工的需要，给阶级制度的产生提供了某种历史的理由，而阶级制度的产生，又给体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工提供了实现的形式。这两者之间的关系，恩格斯已经在“反杜林论”里给我们指明了。他说：“作为阶级划分的基础是分工的规律”（按：恩格斯在此处所指的是体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工），因此，“阶级的划分具有某种历史的理由”；另外，他又把奴隶制称为体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工的“最简单的完全自发形成的形式”。在讨论中，有的同志认为“体力劳动和脑力劳动的对立和分离是剥削阶级为了更残酷地剥削劳动人民所一手造成的”，这当然是不对的，因为这种说法夸大了剥削阶级的主观意志的作用，而没有看到这种分离有它的客观需要和必然性。当然，如果离开阶级发生的过程，也不能说明体力劳动和脑力劳动的分离；历史上体力劳动和脑力劳动的分离，只有在阶级制度这个形式中才得以贯彻实现。
    这个分工在历史上带来了伟大的进步，也产生了严重的恶果。
    第一，这个分工使得大规模的集体劳动成为可能。大规模的劳动协作需要专门的组织者、指挥者，剥削者就担当了这样的角色。这种劳动组织，无疑地起过提高生产力的作用。古代的埃及、印度、中国、希腊、罗马等国家，到现在还留给我们一些宏伟的建筑遗迹，没有大规模的奴隶劳动，这些成就是不可能达到的。既然脑力劳动和体力劳动是支配和被支配的关系，并且剥削阶级“永不会错过机会，为着本身的利益而把愈益增加的劳动重负加到劳动群众的肩上”（恩格斯），那么，体力劳动成为被剥削阶级的沉重的负担，就是很自然的了。少数特权分子得以施展他们的才能，是以多数被剥削的劳动群众失去发展自己的聪明才智的机会为代价的。
    第二，这个分工使脑力劳动者有条件专门从事精神活动，发展文化、艺术和科学。恩格斯曾经说过，没有奴隶制，就没有古希腊、罗马的文化。但是，这个分工也给文化科学的发展带来了不利。多数知识分子依附于统治阶级，就脱离了劳动，脱离了人民，就脱离了文化科学的泉源。在阶级社会的历史里，唯心主义基本上是占统治地位的，这原因之一就在于脑力劳动和体力劳动的分离以及前者对后者的支配。
    第三，统治阶级既然垄断了精神的财富，他们就把一切文化科学成就利用来为自己服务。他们不但对劳动人民实行经济上的剥削，而且利用各种意识形态来对劳动人民施行精神上的压迫。在资本主义社会里，科学技术的每一个发明，不但没有减轻工人的负担，反而成为资本家向工人进攻的新的武器。统治阶级网罗了一批知识分子，他自己不但脱离了体力劳动，而且也逐渐脱离了脑力劳动。反动统治阶级越来越成为文明的敌人，越来越厉害地阻碍科学和艺术的健康发展。在资本主义国家里，普遍地出现了文化的危机。
    这样，到资本主义社会，体力劳动和脑力劳动的对抗就发展到了顶峰。于是，事情就转到它的反面：原来促进了生产发展的，在阶级对立基础上发展的体力劳动和脑力劳动的分裂，现在成为生产进一步发展的障碍了。脑力劳动和体力劳动的分离，从人类的整个历史来说，本来是生产水平有所发展，而又不够发展的产物。当社会生产力无比增长，科学技术有了飞跃的进步的时候，这两种劳动形态又必然需要结合起来。
    资本主义社会把体力劳动和脑力劳动的对立尖锐化了，同时它也为消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的对立准备了条件。
    既然脑力劳动和体力劳动的分离是来源于生产水平相对低下和阶级分裂，那么，在既消灭了阶级又有比现在高得多的生产力的共产主义社会里，脑力劳动和体力劳动就会合而为一。在废除阶级剥削以后，生产力的高度发展是消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别的根本条件，因为：
    一、生产力高度发展的标志是高度的机械化自动化，这一方面将把生产者的体力劳动减到最低限度，一方面又对生产者提出熟悉整个生产过程，掌握丰富的科学技术知识的要求；
    二、生产的高速度发展，不绝地造成新的不平衡，新的生产部门也将不断出现。“大工业的本性，造成劳动的变换、职能的变动、以及工人全面的流动。”（马克思）因之，就造成这样的需要：克服每个人的片面性，根据社会需要或他们自己的爱好，可以从一个生产部门转到另一个生产部门，来全面发挥他们各方面的才能，这样的人，当然更必须掌握多方面的知识；
    三、以上两条说的是生产力的高度发展需要生产者的全面发展，但是生产力的高度发展也使得普遍培养这种全面的人材成为可能。由于劳动生产率无比地提高，每个人从事生产物质生活资料的必要劳动时间就可以大大缩短，这样，每个人就都有充裕的时间来从事文化、科学和艺术的活动，把自己培养成具有高度文化知识水平的、既有广博的知识又有所专长的劳动者。
    由于科学技术的发展，机器正在一步步代替人的各种体力劳动，过去许多人认为无法代替的体力劳动，现在都有新发明的机器来代替了。在这一方面我们还看不到什么止境。因此，认为即使在共产主义社会也仍然是以体力劳动为主的看法是不妥当的。现在甚至有了管理机器和代替一部分脑力劳动的机器——快速电子计算机。在共产主义社会里，人们所需要从事的体力劳动将比现在大大减少和减轻，而且那时的体力劳动的形态也会起很大变化，体力劳动和脑力劳动的界线将消失。未来的劳动是这样的劳动：它用机器代替了那种沉重的、单调的体力劳动，使劳动不再成为沉重的负担和使人厌倦。同时，每一种劳动都需要智力的活动，都需要应用科学技术知识。那时候，机器将是人的多方面的奴隶，而人将越来越多地从事需要智慧的创造性的劳动，因为只有创造性的劳动是机器代替不了的。那时候，人们在劳动的时候仍然会是紧张的，但劳动不再给人限制，而是解放人的手段，不再是沉重的负担，而是“乐生的要素”和“生活的第一需要”。
    二、为缩小体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的距离而努力
    在我国，从解放以后，体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的关系就进入了一个新的历史阶段。党和国家对旧知识分子进行了巨大的改造和教育工作，使知识分子转而为人民服务。轻视体力劳动、轻视工农、反映剥削阶级利益的旧思想遭到了批判。文化科学的一切有价值的成果都用来造福人民。现在我国在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命已经取得伟大的胜利，社会主义制度已经基本上建立起来了，脑力劳动和体力劳动在旧社会中所表现的对抗性矛盾也基本上消灭了。当然，这种对抗性矛盾并没有完全消灭，例如资产阶级右派知识分子和劳动人民之间的矛盾就是对抗性的。至于在人民内部，脑力劳动者和体力劳动者之间的矛盾仍然存在，它表现在：多数体力劳动者的文化技术水平比脑力劳动者还相差较远；脑力劳动者在思想感情上同体力劳动者还有或大或小的距离；知识分子在我国人民中还只占一小部分，他们中有一部分人还没有解决或没有很好解决和工农结合的问题。这是旧社会遗留下来的旧的分工的残余，是短时间内还不能消灭的，只有到共产主义社会才能消灭。
    那末，我们怎样才能逐步地把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来而消灭两者之间的差别呢？前面我们说过了，根本问题是有赖于发展社会生产力。只有社会生产力高度地发展了，例如国民经济各部门，特别是工农业生产实行机械化、自动化、电气化和化学化，这时社会产品才会大大地丰富起来，这样就可以大大减轻劳动的强度，缩短劳动的时间，改善人民的居住条件……，这样才能使劳动人民有更多的时间从事学习，迅速提高文化和科学技术知识的水平。到了这时，社会主义时期还不得不保存的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别就会逐步消灭。特别应当指出的是我国人民公社在这里将起的作用，“它为我国人民指出了农村逐步工业化的道路，农业中的集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制的道路，社会主义的‘按劳分配’（即按劳付酬）逐步过渡到共产主义的按需分配’（即各取所需）的道路，城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别逐步缩小以至消失的道路，以及国家对内职能逐步缩小以至消失的道路。”（关于人民公社若干问题的决议）
    不过，消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，需要有一个比较长的过程。目前，我们需要为实现消灭这个差别而积极准备条件。根据我国的经验，党中央和毛泽东同志指出，一方面要实行普及教育，逐步提高劳动人民的文化技术水平，使工农群众知识化；另一方面要使知识分子到工农群众中去锻炼，特别是参加体力劳动的锻炼，破除资产阶级思想，使知识分子劳动化。当然，现在的脑力劳动者参加体力劳动，并不就是两种劳动的结合，也不等于将来两种劳动的结合形态，而只是使知识分子与工农群众的感情更加接近，改造旧的思想，加强劳动锻炼，缩短了两方面的距离。我们还要开展文化革命和技术革命，通过机械化、电气化的过程，才能改变笨重的体力劳动，逐步实现两种劳动的结合。没有文化的高涨和生产力的大发展，是谈不到两种劳动的真正结合。现在有人以为文化革命只是指工农群众学文化，这是误解。其实不但工农群众要学习文化，就是知识分子也要努力学习，认真读书，不断地增加知识。文化革命不只是普及问题，而且是提高问题；不仅是数量问题，而且是提高质量的问题。
    我国现在还是一个“一穷二白”的国家，工农群众的文化水平还很低，还有不少文盲，小学教育也不够普及，为了建设社会主义和共产主义，我们迫切需要提高劳动人民的文化技术水平。我们要在全国进行扫盲，普及小学教育，并逐步做到普及中等教育。在这一方面，我们已经取得了很大的成绩。据周总理最近在人代大会上所作的政府工作报告，1958年小学生的人数达到八千六百万人，工农业余教育发展很快，扫盲工作也有很大进展。
    在加强知识分子的劳动锻炼方面，我们党和政府也采取了一系列的措施，例如：各级领导人员参加一定时间的体力劳动，下放干部进行劳动锻炼，“将军当兵”、“厂长当工人”和“公社干部当社员”，实行教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，等等，这都促使知识分子劳动化，缩短了脑力劳动者同体力劳动者之间的思想感情距离。一年多来的实践证明这个方针是正确的。许多知识分子，由于下放锻炼，由于参加体力劳动而引起了思想感情的变化，增强了劳动观点和群众观点，增加了生产斗争的知识，向理论和实际结合的方向前进了一步。劳动锻炼也帮助了干部克服三风五气，改善干部和群众的关系，改变了机关工作某些脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义作风，使他们能及时地发现和解决生产和工作中的问题，从而加强了对于工农业生产的具体领导，大大提高了广大劳动群众的革命积极性。一年来的实践也证明，由于我们实行了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，我国学校的面目就为之焕然一新。现在的学校已经逐渐成为教学、生产、科学研究三位一体的培养新型人材的基地。全日制和半日制的各类学校，都已经把生产劳动列为正式课程，学生一面读书，一面做工，实际有效地参加了各种生产劳动。广大师生在劳动锻炼中思想觉悟有了很大的进步，教学质量也有了显著的提高。这样就使学生在德育、智育和体育方面得到全面发展，使他们能够成为一个“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。
    但是，上述这一切，还不能表明体力劳动和脑力劳动已经完全结合了，两者的界线已经消失了。体力劳动和脑力劳动分工的消灭，两者的真正融合，只有在高度机械化、电气化、自动化的基础上才能实现，这是我们对共产主义社会的一个理想，现在我们还不具备实现这个理想的条件，只能为准备和创造这些条件而努力。就目前来说，体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工还是必要的，不能否定的，我们既反对把这种分工看为永恒不变，也反对马上取消这种分工。
    三、评讨论中出现的某些错误论点
    魏高同学认为，“从事脑力劳动的人不必参加体力劳动，过多的体力劳动会妨碍他的脑力的发展。”这句话是值得研究的。魏高同学只是说“过多的”体力劳动会妨碍脑力发展，那么，如果不是“过多”又怎样呢？这一点魏高同学没有说，但他并不是主张减少过多的体力劳动，而是主张“不必参加体力劳动”。我们认为，如果果真是参加体力劳动的时间太多了，以致学习时间太少，那的确是有妨碍的。但不能说体力劳动本身妨碍脑力发展。相反，从人类历史上看，恩格斯早经证明，手的劳动促进了脑的发展。脑力劳动者完全摆脱体力劳动，虽然在历史上曾经起过进步作用，但是由于偏废了生产实践这一方面，也给脑力劳动者带来了不利，这是我们在前面解释过了的。今天学生参加体力劳动，无论对他们的德、智、体三方面说，都是有很大好处的。社会主义和共产主义需要又红又专、全面发展的人，而脑力劳动者参加一些体力劳动，正是为培养这种新人而采取的重要措施之一。首先，参加体力劳动能够改变知识分子的思想感情，使他们体会到劳动的艰苦和伟大，锻炼他们的意志和性格，培养他们热爱劳动、热爱集体、热爱劳动人民的感情，提高他们的共产主义觉悟。今天占全中国大多数的工农群众都是从事体力劳动的；知识分子如果完全脱离体力劳动，那么他们的思想感情就不可能和工农打成一片；干部如果完全脱离体力劳动，也就往往难以熟悉群众，深入群众，发现工作中的问题。我们说要为人民服务，如果我们连服务的对象都不熟悉，在生活上和他们隔绝，怎么能很好地为他们服务呢？况且，参加体力劳动，对于“四体不勤，五谷不分”的知识分子来说，也能大大丰富他们的实际生产知识，有利于他们的身体健康。知识分子虽然号称有知识，但主要只是一些书本上的知识，如果说到农村和工厂的情况，说到生产劳动的知识，那么知识分子常常是最无知的。因此，参加生产劳动难道不是学习这种知识的好机会吗？不是帮助知识分子把书本知识同实际知识相结合的好机会吗？当然，对于知识分子、干部和学生的参加劳动，需要很好安排，使他们的体力劳动尽可能和他们的专业结合（我们说“尽可能结合”，因为如果每人都要求自己所参加的每一项劳动都和自己的专业结合，那在现在是不可能的）。另外，所占时间也应有适当的规定。有时安排得不妥善，执行得不好，的确也会妨碍专业学习。这一方面的问题，需要加以研究，总结一年来的经验，予以改进。但从原则上说来，知识分子参加体力劳动是有益的，必需的，不能动摇的。
    魏高同学又认为，“共产主义社会仍然会有天才，没有必要叫天才去做不擅长的工作，否则就埋没了天才”。共产主义社会当然仍会有天才，不但有，而且会非常多。共产主义社会就是一个出天才的社会。天才从哪里来？从群众中来。劳动人民当中是有很多天才的，但是在旧时代，他们终身为糊口而劳累，得不到受培养受教育的机会，所以他们的聪明才智不能充分发挥出来。旧时代的知识分子中也有不少天才，但是许多天才由于脱离人民，由于受到阶级偏见的束缚，以致他们的天才或者受到了很大的限制，或者向错误的方向发展。旧式的体力劳动脑力劳动的固定分工，对体力劳动者和脑力劳动者两方面的才能发展都是起了不利作用的。只有在将来消灭了体力劳动和脑力劳动差别的共产主义社会里，才为人的全面的高度的发展提供一切可能性。当然，我们也不同意像富友仁同志在批驳魏高同志的论点时那样认为：在共产主义社会中，“人人都是理论家、科学家、发明家、作家、歌唱家”。这也是对未来社会的劳动的一种误解。在共产主义社会中，旧制度遗留下来的分工（城乡之间的分工、脑力劳动同体力劳动之间的分工、熟练劳动同非熟练劳动之间的分工、繁重劳动同轻易劳动之间的分工）是要消灭的，科学和技术的发展要求人们具有广博的文化技术知识和多种多样的劳动技能，终身束缚于一种职业上的苦痛将得到彻底的消灭，每个人都将得到自由的全面的发展。但这并不意味着人们将掌握一切专门技能，并不意味着每一个人必须在每一个部门里都达到同样的成就。在将来，重点的知识和技能仍是需要的，每个人将是又博又专的。可以设想，一个人同样程度地精通一切科学和技术，这是不可能的事情。马克思和恩格斯曾经指出：在共产主义社会中，并非每一个人都是拉斐尔，但是每一个像拉斐尔这样的人都有一切可能不受限制地全面地发展自己的才能。在共产主义社会中，劳动分工和专业也将是还会存在的。不过，那将有着一种新的性质。
    当然，对于某一方面的能力，有的人掌握得较快，掌握得较好。这可能同人的解剖生理和中枢神经系统的某些天生特性（素质）有关。但是，这种特性也只是为能力的发展提供了前提，而还需要在教育和教学过程中加以发展。而且，能力只是保证活动获得成功的重要条件之一，并不是保证活动获得成功的唯一条件。完成一种活动的成绩，不仅取决于能力，而且也取决于其他一系列的条件，特别是取决于人的世界观。对于一个具有某一方面天资的人，如果只教给他以某一方面的知识，而对于其他方面，特别是共产主义的观点和信念却不加培养，那末他还是根本无法对革命事业贡献出创造性的成绩的。我们现在提倡参加体力劳动，也是对树立共产主义的世界观有重大作用的。况且，脑力劳动者适当参加一些体力劳动，这并不是改行。如果某些专业（例如某些艺术表演）确会因参加某种劳动而受影响，那也是可以适当安排而解决的。
    人韦同志认为，“消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的重大差别，问题不在于把已经有一定科学文化水平的大学生去从事和本身业务无关的劳动，而在于提高工农劳动人民的科学文化知识，也就是说，不是高拉向低，而应该是低去迎合高。”什么叫做“高”？什么叫做“低”？这可以有不同的理解。“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”，这是一种理解。但是，这是一种陈旧的，也是一种错误的观点。按照我们看来，脑力劳动者有较多的知识，这当然是可贵的。但是，列宁曾经指出：“只有在劳动中与工人农民打成一片，才能成为真正的共产主义者。”（“青年团的任务”）脑力劳动者轻视和脱离体力劳动，这本身就是缺乏共产主义觉悟的表现。我们需要的是又红又专的干部。从“红”的程度这一方面说，许多知识分子是远低于工农群众的。所以，提倡知识分子劳动化，不是“高拉向低”，倒是“低拉向高”。即使从知识方面说，如果是指书本知识，知识分子当然比工农多些，至于实际的感性知识，就不如工农了。所以，知识分子在劳动中也能增长知识。毛主席说：“有什么办法使这种仅有书本知识的人变为名副其实的知识分子呢？唯一的办法就是使他们参加到实际工作中去，变为实际工作者。”参加劳动，也是参加生产斗争的实际。脱离生活和实践的脑力劳动者，在一定的意义上来说，不是“高”，而正是“低”。
    当然，体力劳动者有实践的经验，而缺乏理性的知识，他们的知识也是比较地不完全的，这是一个弱点。特别是经济的进步、科学和技术的发展，需要既有熟练的技能、又有丰富的文化技术知识的人。这就要求他们迅速掌握现代的文化技术知识。另外，脑力劳动者的知识也还需要继续提高，不能因为强调了参加体力劳动就轻视书本学习和业务的提高。这一点，我们在前面也说过了。
    编后
    关于脑力劳动和体力劳动分工问题的讨论已经进行了几个月，先后发表的文章已有十八篇。过去讨论中的绝大部分文章都是谈的关于体力劳动的重要性，关于脑力劳动和体力劳动将来结合起来的必然性以及脑力劳动者参加体力劳动的必要性等等问题；但是，关于脑力劳动的重要性，关于脑力劳动和体力劳动在社会主义建设中分工合作的必要性，关于劳动人民学习科学文化知识的重要性，关于知识分子还要继续提高自己，以及要建成社会主义必须掀起一个科学文化高潮等等问题却谈得极少或者根本没有谈到。为了使这一讨论更深入、更全面，更紧密地结合当前社会主义建设，我们打算继续发表几篇有关这些方面的文章，希望读者能够就这个问题的各个方面继续发表意见。
