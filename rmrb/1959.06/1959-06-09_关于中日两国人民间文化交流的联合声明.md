Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The full text of the Joint Statement on Cultural Exchanges Between the Peoples of China and Japan is as follows:

In May 1959, at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, a delegation from the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and the Japan-China Friendship Association, headed by Kenzo Nakajima, visited China to promote cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan. They conducted friendly consultations with the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries on relevant issues concerning cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan for the next two years and reached a consensus.

In recent years, thanks to the joint efforts of the peoples of China and Japan, there has been significant development in cultural exchanges between the two countries, which has made a significant contribution to deepening mutual understanding and enhancing friendship between the two peoples. However, due to the Kishida Nobusuke government of Japan's hostility towards China, Sino-Japanese relations have fallen into an extremely abnormal state. Currently, the Kishida government still refuses to abandon its plot to create "two Chinas," change its policy of hostility towards China, and continues to obstruct the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, which inevitably has a serious impact on cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan. Therefore, now and in the future, cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan must be based on continuously enhancing mutual friendship and trust between the two peoples and fighting against all forces that obstruct friendly relations between the two countries, in order to promote the revival of Asian and African culture on a new basis of independence and autonomy, and to safeguard world peace.

The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Delegation representing Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and Japan-China Friendship Association unanimously agreed to work together to achieve the following cultural exchanges and friendly interactions:

	I.	To hold a Chinese cultural and economic exhibition, a Chinese print exhibition, a Chinese stamp exhibition, and a Chinese calligraphy exhibition in Japan.
	II.	To hold a Japanese-style painting exhibition and a Japanese calligraphy exhibition in China.
	III.	The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries will invite Japanese theater groups to perform in China.
	IV.	The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries will invite Japanese literature delegations, Japanese writing reform delegations, Japanese painter delegations, and individual figures from the cultural circles to visit China.
	V.	In addition, both parties will continue to maintain close contact and consultation regarding other cultural, academic exchanges, and friendly visits in the future.

    关于中日两国人民间文化交流的联合声明
    新华社8日讯　关于中日两国人民间文化交流的联合声明，全文如下：
    1959年5月，以中岛健藏为首的日本中国文化交流协会和日本中国友好协会的代表团为了促进中日两国人民间的文化交流，应中国人民对外文化协会的邀请，访问了中国，并同中国人民对外文化协会就今明两年的中日两国人民间的文化交流的有关问题，进行了友好的协商，取得了一致意见。
    几年来，由于中日两国人民的共同努力，两国人民间的文化交流曾经有过很大的发展，对于加深两国人民间的相互了解，增进两国人民友谊，有着重大的贡献。然而，由于日本岸信介政府敌视中国，致使中日两国关系陷于极不正常的状态。目前岸政府仍然不肯放弃制造两个中国的阴谋、改变敌视中国的政策，并且继续阻碍中日两国邦交的恢复，致使中日两国人民间的文化交流也不能不受到严重的影响，因此，现在和将来，中日两国人民间的文化交流必须以不断增进两国人民间的相互友好和信任为基础，并对阻碍两国人民友好关系的一切势力进行斗争，借以推进以独立自主为新基础的亚非文化复兴，维护世界和平。
    中国人民对外文化协会和日本中国文化交流协会、日本中国友好协会的代表团一致同意为实现下列各项文化交流和友好往来而共同努力：
    一、在日本举办中国文化经济展览会、中国版画展览会、中国邮票展览会、中国书法展览会。
    二、在中国举办日本国画展览会、日本书法展览会。
    三、中国人民对外文化协会将邀请日本的戏剧团体来中国进行演出。
    四、中国人民对外文化协会将邀请日本文学代表团、日本文字改革代表团、日本画家代表团以及文化界个别人士来中国访问。
    五、此外，其他有关文化、学术交流和友好访问，今后双方将继续进行紧密的联系和协商。
                                            1959年6月8日
