Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 12th: The Japanese "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" issued a statement today stating that in order to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," they will resolutely fight to the end. The statement also called on the Japanese people to form a united front against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The statement pointed out that the purpose of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is to: establish a U.S.-Japan military alliance; prepare the "Self-Defense Forces" to implement nuclear armament and dispatch troops abroad; pave the way for joint U.S.-Japan operations; openly allow the U.S. military to transport nuclear weapons into Japan and launch them from Japanese bases to foreign countries, and allow the U.S. military to interfere in Japan's internal affairs. The statement pointed out that due to the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," Japan will not only deepen its subordination to the United States militarily and worsen its relations with socialist countries, but also Japan will become a war provocateur and a perpetrator of atomic and hydrogen bomb attacks.

The statement said that if the conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is allowed to succeed, militarism will be revived in Japan, and democracy and the people's lives will face a crisis. The statement said that therefore, the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is also a struggle to strive for Japan's independence, neutrality, and defense of the constitution. The statement finally called on the Japanese people to actively participate in the national unified action day activities to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" that will be launched on the 25th.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 10th: The Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper "Red Flag" recently exposed the contents of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" draft and the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

"Red Flag" said that the new treaty draft prepared by the U.S. and Japanese governments stipulates that the name of the current U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" should be cancelled and changed to the U.S.-Japan "Security Cooperation Treaty." The reason for adding the two words "cooperation" is to: raise the banner of "U.S.-Japan equality" to implement U.S.-Japan "joint defense"; and not only "cooperate in defense," but also "cooperate" in political, economic and other aspects. Japan can therefore use the United States as its backing for its expansion into Southeast Asia, and the United States can therefore demand that Japan act as its anti-communist vanguard in the Far East.

"Red Flag" said that the new treaty will consist of a preamble and ten articles. Its characteristics are simple and abstract wording, and the articles do not mention issues such as the U.S. military transporting nuclear weapons, the U.S. military dispatching troops from Japan to the Far East, and how to handle Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. These points, which would be resolutely opposed by the people, will be stipulated by "exchange of notes" outside the treaty. Important issues will be "explained" by exchanging notes to deceive the people; at the same time, a path will be opened in advance so that the contents of the exchanged notes can be changed through diplomatic negotiations when necessary. This is a traitorous treaty that clearly reveals its nature of subservience to the United States.

"Red Flag" pointed out that the new treaty will establish a "semi-permanent military alliance" between Japan and the United States. The newspaper said that the "Preamble" to the treaty draft clearly stipulates: the U.S. and Japan agree to cooperate and strive to strengthen their "defense capabilities" "in order to maintain peace and security in the Far East until a broader and more effective security system is formed." The U.S. and Japan also attempt to form an anti-communist military group with Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Ngo Dinh Diem at its core; Japan must undertake the obligation to make efforts to achieve this goal.

The newspaper said that Article 3 of the draft stipulates that "in order to achieve the purposes of this treaty more effectively, [the parties] shall, individually and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, develop their capacity to resist armed attack." The Japanese side promised to train an army that the United States "finds pleasing."

"Red Flag" also pointed out that Article 5 of the draft stipulates that "an attack on the U.S. military stationed in Japan will be considered an attack on Japan, and the two sides will take joint action." Therefore, if a situation like the Korean War or the Taiwan Strait incident occurs, Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" may immediately be "ready to dispatch," and strict military control may be implemented domestically. As a result, Japan may become a scorched earth of atomic war.

"Red Flag" pointed out that the new treaty draft also allows Japan to give rights, powers, and authority to the U.S. military stationed in Japan. Article 6 of the draft stipulates that "the United States has the right to deploy land, sea, and air forces in and around Japan."

"Red Flag" finally said that although the words "within the scope of the Constitution" are used everywhere in the treaty draft, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party always interpret the Constitution at will according to the wishes of the U.S.-Japan ruling class, and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" itself violates the Constitution. The phrase "within the scope of the Constitution" is just a decoration designed to deceive the people.

### 日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”发出号召  建立统一战线反对日美“安全条约”  “赤旗报”揭露新的“安全条约”是屈从美国的卖国条约

    日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”发出号召
    建立统一战线反对日美“安全条约”
    “赤旗报”揭露新的“安全条约”是屈从美国的卖国条约
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天发表声明表示，为了阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”，他们将坚决斗争到底。声明并且号召日本人民组成反对修改日美“安全条约”的统一战线。
    声明指出，修改日美“安全条约”的目的在于：建立日美军事同盟；准备“自卫队”实行核武装和向国外出兵；为日美共同作战开辟道路；公开允许美军向日本运进核武器和由日本基地开向国外以及容许美军干涉日本内政。声明指出，由于修改日美“安全条约”，日本不仅将在军事上加深从属于美国，同社会主义各国的关系更加恶化，而且日本将变成战争挑衅者和原子弹氢弹的加害者。
    声明说，如果容许修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋得逞，日本国内将复活军国主义，民主和人民的生活将面临危机。声明说，因此，日本人民阻止修改日美
  “安全条约”的斗争也是争取日本的独立、中立和维护宪法的斗争。声明最后号召日本人民积极参加将在25日展开的阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”全国统一行动日活动。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”最近揭露了新的日美“安全条约”草案的内容和日美反动派的阴谋。
    “赤旗报”说，日美两国政府拟订好的新条约草案规定要取消现在用的日美“安全条约”这个名字，改为日美“安全合作条约”。所以特别要加“合作”这两个字，是为了：扯起“日美平等”这个幌子来实行日美“共同防御”；而且，不仅在“防卫方面实行合作”，还要在政治、经济和其他方面实行“合作”。日本因此就可以把美国作为自己向东南亚扩张的后盾，而美国因此也可以要求日本充当它在远东的反共先头部队。
    “赤旗报”说，新条约将由序言和十项条款构成。它的特点是文字简单而抽象，条文完全不提美军运进核武器、美军从日本出动到远东地区去、如何处理冲绳岛和小笠原群岛等问题。会遭到人民坚决反对的这几点都将由条约以外的“交换公文”加以规定。重要的问题都将依靠交换公文加以“解释”，来欺骗人民；同时预先开辟一条道路，以便将来有必要的时候能够通过外交谈判改变所交换公文的内容。这是一个清清楚楚地显露了屈从美国的性质的卖国条约。
    “赤旗报”指出，新条约将使日本同美国建立“半永久性的军事同盟”。报纸说，条约草案“序言”明确规定：日美两国相约要实行合作，努力加强双方的“防御力量”，“以便维持远东的和平与安全，直至组成更广泛而有成效的安全体系时止。”日美还企图以这个同盟为核心，同李承晚、蒋介石和吴庭艳等组成一个反共军事集团；日本要承担为了达到这个目的而进行努力的义务。
    报纸说，草案第三条规定“为了更有成效地达到本条约规定的目的，要单独或者联合起来，通过不断而有效的自助和互助，发展抵御武装进攻的能力。”日方答应练成一支美国“看得顺眼”的军队。
    “赤旗报”还指出，草案的第五条规定“对驻日美军实行的进攻将被认为是对日本实行的进攻，双方就要联合行动”。因此，如果出现像朝鲜战争或台湾海峡事件之类的局面，日本“自卫队”恐怕就可以立即“待命出动”，在国内也可以实施严格的军事管制。结果，日本很可能变成原子战争的一片焦土。
    “赤旗报”指出，新条约草案还使日本把权利、权力和权限送给驻日美军。草案第六条规定“美国有权在日本国内及其周围部署陆、海、空军”。
    “赤旗报”最后说，虽然在条约草案到处使用“在宪法的范围内”等字样，但是，岸信介内阁和自由民主党总是按照日美统治阶层的意思随便解释宪法，而且，日美“安全条约”本身就是违反宪法的。“在宪法的范围内”这句话不过是一种为了欺骗人民而设的装饰品而已。
