    Hot Spray Paint
    Tianjin Paint and Pigment General Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a kind of hot spray paint. The solid content of hot spray paint is 55% more than that of cold spray paint. Therefore, for items that require three or two coats with cold spray paint, only two or one coats are needed with hot spray paint. Before use, cold spray paint must be mixed with one to one and a half times the amount of thinner made of esters, alcohols, benzenes, etc., while hot spray paint can use 70% less thinner and has the advantages of good gloss and fewer runs.

    热喷漆
    天津市油漆颜料总厂最近试制成功一种热喷漆。热喷漆的固体含量比冷喷漆多百分之五十五，因此用冷喷漆必须喷涂三次或两次的东西，用热喷漆只要两次或一次就可以。冷喷漆在使用前，必须先兑入一倍到一倍半的酯、醇、苯类等作成的喷漆稀料，而热喷漆可以少用百分之七十以上的喷漆稀料，并且有光泽好、流挂病少等优点。
