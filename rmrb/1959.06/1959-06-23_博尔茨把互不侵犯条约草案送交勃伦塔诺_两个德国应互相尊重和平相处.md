Xinhua News Agency, Berlin Dispatch from German News Agency: Dr. Bolz, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, submitted a draft of a non-aggression treaty between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to West German Foreign Minister Brentano on the 19th.

    The draft treaty stipulates in its clauses that: The contracting parties shall not engage in any threat or use of force in their mutual relations; the contracting parties solemnly guarantee to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the other contracting party, and guarantee to devote themselves to the reunification of Germany only by peaceful means; the contracting parties shall take all necessary measures to prevent activities on their own territory related to fostering, preparing, and carrying out military actions against the other contracting party; if a third party attacks one of the contracting parties, the other contracting party shall not provide support to the aggressor, even if it bears mutual assistance or other obligations to the aggressor, this guarantee shall also be effective; the contracting parties shall resolve all existing or future disputes between them in a spirit of mutual understanding through negotiation or other peaceful means. If one of the contracting parties believes that the provisions of this treaty have been violated or that the observance of the treaty is endangered, both parties shall consult for this purpose and agree to take appropriate measures.

    The clauses also specifically mention that the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty shall not affect the relationship of the contracting states to their original military alliances.

    According to the provisions of the draft treaty, the treaty shall remain in effect until the establishment of a unified German state.

    In the letter attached to the draft treaty, Bolz wrote that the government of the German Democratic Republic proposes to use this draft as a basis for negotiations, and authorizes Bolz to accept the other party's suggestions and conduct negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 21st: The delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic participating in the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, led by Foreign Minister Bolz, returned to Berlin by special train at noon today.

    Bolz told reporters at the station that we returned during a recess that we consider completely unnecessary. The Western countries' interruption of the negotiations means that they are not yet willing to draw conclusions from the actual situation.

    Bolz pointed out that the purpose of West Germany in causing the conference to fail was not achieved. He said that facts have proved that attempts to lead the conference into a dead end, in violation of the wishes of the people of all countries, cannot be done.

    Bolz finally said that the people of the German Democratic Republic support the position of its government delegation in Geneva.

    He said that the strength of the German Democratic Republic will continue to play a role in achieving success at the Foreign Ministers' Conference when it resumes.

    博尔茨把互不侵犯条约草案送交勃伦塔诺
    两个德国应互相尊重和平相处
    新华社讯　德意志通讯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨博士19日把德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间的互不侵犯条约草案送交西德外交部长勃伦塔诺。
    这份条约草案在条款中规定：缔约双方在彼此间的相互关系中将不进行任何种武力威胁或使用武力；缔约双方郑重保证尊重缔约对方的领土完整和主权，并保证只采用和平手段来致力于恢复德国的统一；缔约双方将采取一切必要的措施来制止在自己的领土上从事有关扶植、准备和执行针对缔约对方的武力行动；如果有第三方进攻缔约一方时，缔约另一方将不给侵略者以支持，即使它对侵略者承担有互助或其他义务时，此项保证亦应有效；缔约双方将在相互谅解的精神下通过谈判途径或其他和平手段来解决彼此之间已有的、或将有的一切争执问题。如果缔约一方认为本条约条款受到侵犯或对条约的遵守受到危害时，双方即应为此目的进行协商并协议采取适当措施。
    条款中还特别提到，缔结互不侵犯条约将不影响缔约国原来隶属于军事联盟的关系。
    根据条约草案的规定，直到设立一个统一的德意志国家为止，这个条约将一直有效。
    博尔茨在转送这份条约草案时所附的信里写道，德意志民主共和国政府建议把这份草案作为谈判基础，并且授予博尔茨全权来接受对方建议和进行谈判。
    新华社柏林21日电　参加日内瓦外长会议的德意志民主共和国政府代表团在外交部长博尔茨率领下，今天中午乘专车返抵柏林。
    博尔茨在车站对新闻记者说，我们是在一个我们认为根本没有必要的休会期间回来的。西方国家中断了谈判意味着他们还不愿意从现实的形势中得出结论。
    博尔茨指出，西德使会议遭到失败的目的没有能够达到。他说，事实证明，违反各国人民的愿望企图把会议引入死胡同的做法，是办不到的。
    博尔茨最后说，德意志民主共和国人民支持它的政府代表团在日内瓦的立场。
    他说，德意志民主共和国的力量将在外长会议复会时在使会议取得成就方面继续发挥作用。
