　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 23rd: The West River flood peak will reach Gaoyao tonight, and tomorrow morning, it will meet the strengthened North River flood peak. The struggle of the people of Guangdong Province against the floods of the West River and North River is about to enter a decisive stage.

　　After the West River flood peak passed Wuzhou, Guangxi, at 2:00 AM today, the leading edge reached Gaoyao City near the Pearl River Delta at 2:00 PM today. The West River water level in Gaoyao City rose from 10.81 meters yesterday morning to 11.29 meters, and the flood flow also surged from 34,000 cubic meters per second yesterday morning to 36,109 cubic meters per second at 2:00 PM today, and is still continuing to rise at a rate of about 2 centimeters per hour.

　　Heavy rain of 60 millimeters fell again in the central and eastern regions of the North River yesterday afternoon, which strengthened the flood peak that appeared in the North River yesterday. Today, the North River water level in Qingyuan and Shijiao continued to rise. By 8:00 PM, the water level in Shijiao had risen to 11.02 meters, which was 0.39 meters higher than the 10.63 meters yesterday morning, and the flood flow rose to 7,640 cubic meters per second, which was more than 500 cubic meters per second higher than the 7,100 cubic meters per second yesterday morning. Moreover, the rising trend has not stopped tonight.

　　It is estimated that the West River flood peak reaching Gaoyao City tonight will meet the strengthened North River flood peak today at Sixian Village, 50 kilometers west of Guangzhou, tomorrow morning, and then press towards the Pearl River Delta and Guangzhou City, where the water level is already very high and is also affected by the South China Sea tide.

　　After several days and nights of hard work, the flood control army in the lower reaches of the West River and North River and the Pearl River Delta has completed the preparations for repairing dangerous sections, raising or strengthening embankments to meet the flood peak in a short period of time, and inspected them yesterday and today.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 23rd: Our reporter Du Daozheng reports: While striving to meet the extraordinary flood peaks that have arrived in the North River and are about to arrive in the West River, the people of Guangdong are actively carrying out disaster relief and production for self-relief movements.

　　The extraordinary floods in the Dongjiang River, Zengjiang River, and Liuxi River basins are continuing to recede. Some flooded towns and villages have emerged from the water or partially emerged from the water. Most of the people who were surrounded by floods on the mountains have come down the mountains. The people surrounded by floods have been completely rescued by the joint efforts of the military and civilians under the leadership of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee. Party committees and governments at all levels are now leading the people, with the support of the People's Liberation Army and urban workers, to continue to rescue flooded fields, houses, and property. The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee has issued a call to vigorously restore production for self-relief, and put forward the fighting slogan of "Striving to basically eliminate the traces of disaster before the end of this year."

　　The disaster caused by the floods in the Dongjiang River, Zengjiang River, and Liuxi River basins is enormous, the largest since liberation. The torrential rain began on June 11th, spreading throughout the province except for Hainan Island, and concentrated in the Dongjiang River, Zengjiang River, and Liuxi River basins. For example, Boluo County received more than 300 millimeters of rain on the 14th alone. Several days of torrential rain caused mountain floods in nine counties including Heyuan, Boluo, Huiyang, Zengcheng, and Conghua, and the streams and rivers surged, causing floods to flow horizontally. The water ponds and reservoirs and other water storage projects built in these places in recent years were all filled, losing their flood control capacity, and all dikes were either washed away or flooded. For a time, all counties except mountains and highlands became swamps. In Boluo County alone, 500,000 mu of crops were flooded; more than 1.08 million mu of economic crops such as sugarcane, jute, and peanuts were flooded in the entire county (all have now been rescued). About 100,000 mu of fish ponds were flooded, about 160,000 mu of late rice seedling fields were flooded, more than 200,000 houses collapsed, more than 28,000 large and small water conservancy projects were washed away, about 2 million people were affected by the disaster, and 187 cadres and masses died due to the collapse of houses or being washed away by water due to rescue failure, 29 people were missing, and 204 people were injured.

　　The Standing Committee of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee held on the afternoon of the 21st pointed out that the disaster has caused huge losses and will undoubtedly cause great difficulties for future work. However, through the united efforts of the whole party and the whole people, difficulties can be overcome. Taking the province as a whole, there are 28 million mu of early rice in the province, and currently less than 5 million mu have been affected by the disaster, accounting for only 17%. With early rice affected by the disaster, grain will certainly be more difficult than before, but the difficulties can be overcome by harvesting the early rice that has not been affected by the disaster. Some of the flooded early rice can still be rescued for some harvest. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee also pointed out that this torrential rain and flood disaster has tested the combat effectiveness of the party organizations and the people of Guangdong. Since we were able to rescue all the trapped people in the event of a sudden flood, reduce the disaster situation, and achieve victory in the first round of the flood control and disaster relief struggle, why can't we win greater victories in the disaster relief work and in the movement for production for self-relief?

　　The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee requires organizations at all levels in the disaster areas and throughout the province to immediately focus on rebuilding homes and restoring production, and to vigorously increase the propagation of late rice seedlings, organize a mass movement for a bumper harvest of late rice throughout the province, and strive for a bumper harvest of late rice to restore vitality. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the support of the people of the whole country, this victory can certainly be achieved. Now, the Central Government is planning to allocate late rice seeds for Guangdong, and the province is raising draft cattle and farm tools for the disaster areas, and it is necessary to ensure that the disaster areas and the whole province plant and plant late rice well.

　　Regarding disaster relief work, the Provincial Party Committee requires disaster areas to build sheds as soon as possible so that the victims who have returned from the mountains can live there, and ensure the supply of food for the victims. The disaster areas should also start repairing houses and fully restore sideline production. In order to restore and develop production in the disaster areas as soon as possible, the Provincial Party Committee decided to convene a meeting of county party secretaries on the 25th.

　　Under the leadership of party committees at all levels and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army and urban workers, the work of rescuing victims and rescuing materials in the disaster areas of Guangdong Province has basically ended. The victims who were trapped on the top of the mountains have all moved to the villages, and those whose houses have collapsed have built thatched houses. The most severely affected areas also have several days of food. Now, the floods in the three counties of Heyuan, Huaxian, and Conghua in the severely affected areas have receded below the warning water level, the floods in Zengcheng County have receded in most areas, the floods in Boluo and Huiyang counties have receded in some areas, and the floods in Dongguan County have receded in a small area. Various tasks for restoring production in these places, such as washing rice and supporting rice, rushing to harvest mature crops, rescuing melons and vegetables, sowing late rice, rushing to repair dikes, and water conservancy, have all begun, and some are doing it vigorously. Within a few days, eight communes in Huiyang County rescued more than 45,000 mu of crops, rescued more than 11,000 mu of seedlings, replanted more than 1,800 mu of seedlings, repaired 209 water conservancy projects, and repaired 56 houses. Some counties and some communes in the disaster areas have also formulated plans for restoring production after comprehensively analyzing the disaster situation. Some places outside the disaster areas have put forward the slogan of striving to harvest 20 jin more early rice per mu and planting 5 fen of land more per person to support the disaster areas.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 23rd: Two million people in Guangzhou City are fully participating in the flood control struggle in the West River, North River, and Pearl River Delta. In order to prevent unexpected situations, Guangzhou City has also carried out necessary preparations for flood control and flood prevention.

　　These days, trains, cars, and ships fully loaded with flood control equipment and urgently needed materials have been heading to the flood-threatened areas such as the North River Dam, Liuxi River, and the Pearl River Delta day and night at the stations and wharves of Guangzhou City. In addition, the city has also invested a large amount of manpower and technical force in the flood control struggle. More than 900 people from the Guangzhou Municipal Construction Department immediately joined forces with the peasant brothers in the battle to reinforce the North River Dam as soon as they arrived on the North River Dam.

    广东全民奋起抗洪救灾
    防汛大军抢修堤围准备同西江北江特大洪峰决战
    东江等地被困人民全部脱险，灾区开展生产自救
    据新华社广州23日电　西江洪峰将于今天晚上到达高要，明天早晨，将和加强了的北江洪峰相遇，广东省人民和西江、北江洪水的斗争即将进入决战阶段。
    西江的洪峰于今天早晨二时过广西的梧州后，前峰已于今天下午二时到达珠江三角洲附近的高要城。高要城的西江水位，从昨晨的一零点八一公尺上升到一一点二九公尺，洪水流量也从昨晨的三万四千秒公方猛升到今日下午二时的三万六千一百零九秒公方，并仍以水位每小时二公分左右的幅度继续上涨。
    北江中部和东部地区昨天下午又下了六十公厘的大雨。这就使北江昨天出现的洪峰加强了。今天清远、石角的北江水位还继续上涨，到下午八时，石角的水位已涨到十一点零二公尺，比昨晨的一零点六三公尺又高了零点三九公尺，洪水流量上涨到七千六百四十秒公方，比昨晨的七千一百秒公方又多了五百多秒公方。而且涨势到今夜还没有停止。
    估计今晚到达高要城的西江洪峰，将和今日加强了的北江的洪峰，于明日早晨，在广州西边五十公里的思贤?汇合，然后压向水位本来已经很高、又受到南海大潮袭击的珠江三角洲和广州市。
    西江、北江下游和珠江三角洲的防洪大军经过这几天的日夜奋战，已在短短的几天时间内，完成了抢修险段、加高或加固堤围以迎击洪峰的准备工作，并于昨天和今天进行了检查。
    新华社广州23日电　本社记者杜导正报道：广东人民一方面奋力迎击北江已经到来和西江即将到来的特大洪峰，一方面积极开展救灾和生产自救运动。
    东江、增江、流溪河等流域的特大洪水在继续消退中，有些被淹城镇和村庄已经出水或部分出水，大部曾被洪水围在山头上的人民已经下山，被洪水围困的人民，已经由中共广东省委领导下的军民协力全部救出。各级党和政府，现正领导人民在人民解放军和城市职工支援下继续抢救被淹田禾、房屋和财物。中共广东省委员会已经发出了大力恢复生产自救的号召，提出了“为力争在今年年底前基本上消灭灾害痕迹而奋斗”的战斗口号。
    这次东江、增江、流溪河等流域洪水所造成的灾害是巨大的，是解放以来最大的一次。暴雨从6月11日开始，遍及除海南岛外的全省各地，更集中于东江、增江和流溪河流域各地。例如博罗县14日一天降雨达三百多公厘。几天暴雨造成了河源、博罗、惠阳、增城、从化等九县山洪暴发，溪河猛涨，洪水横流。这些地方几年来所修建的水塘、水库等蓄水工程尽都灌满，失去抗洪能力，所有堤圩不是被冲毁就是被洪水漫过。一时各县除山岭、高地外，尽成泽国。博罗一县被淹农作物达五十万亩；全县被水围在山头的人民达十万以上（现已全部救出）据18日不完全统计，全省受浸早稻田达四百八十万亩左右，受淹受浸的甘蔗、黄麻、花生等经济作物一百零八万亩左右。受淹受浸渔塘十万亩左右，受淹受浸晚稻秧田十六万亩，倒塌房屋二十万间以上，冲坏冲垮大小水利工程二万八千多处，受灾人口二百万左右，因房屋倒塌或抢救不及被水冲走致死的干部、群众一百八十七人，失踪二十九人，伤二百零四人。
    21日下午举行的中共广东省委常委会指出：此次灾害损失巨大，无疑地对今后工作造成了极大的困难。但是通过全党全民团结一致的努力，困难是可以克服的。就全省说：全省早稻二千八百万亩，目前受灾的不到五百万亩，只占17％。早稻受灾，粮食当然会较前困难，但收好未受灾的早稻，困难可以渡过。被淹的早稻有些还可抢救出一些收成。省委常委会还指出：这次暴雨洪水灾害，考验了广东的党组织和人民群众的战斗力。我们既然能够在洪水到来猝不及防的情况下，抢救出全部被困人民，缩小了灾情，取得了抗洪救灾斗争第一个回合的胜利；那么，我们为什么不能在救灾工作中，在生产自救的运动中打更大的胜仗呢？
    中共广东省委会要求灾区和全省各级组织用最大力量立刻大抓重建家园恢复生产工作，大抓晚稻的秧苗增殖工作，组织一个全省晚稻生产大丰收的群众运动，夺取晚稻大丰收来恢复元气。省委指出：在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在全国人民的支援下，一定能够取得这个胜利。现在，中央正在为广东筹拨晚稻种籽，全省正在为灾区筹集耕牛、农具，一定要保证灾区和全省的晚稻种上、种好。
    关于救灾工作，省委要求灾区尽速搭棚子，使山上回来的灾民住下来，并保证灾民的口粮供应。灾区还要着手大修民房全力恢复副业生产。为了尽速恢复和发展灾区生产，省委决定25日召开一次县委书记会议。
    在各级党委领导下，在人民解放军和城市职工的大力支援下，现在广东省灾区抢救灾民，抢救物资的工作已基本结束。被洪水围困在山顶上的灾民已全部搬到村庄里来，房子倒塌了的，已盖起了茅草房。最严重的灾区也有几天的口粮。现在重灾区的河源、花县、从化三县洪水已退到警戒水位下，增城县洪水退了大部分，博罗、惠阳两县退了一部分，东莞县退了一少部分。这些地方恢复生产的各种工作，如洗禾扶禾、抢收已成熟作物、抢救瓜菜、晚稻播种、抢修堤围、水利等都已开始，有的搞得轰轰烈烈。惠阳县八个公社几天内便抢救出农作物四万五千多亩，抢救出秧苗一万一千多亩，补播秧苗一千八百多亩，修复水利工程二百零九处，修好房子五十六间。灾区有的县和一些公社也在全面分析灾情后，拟定了恢复生产的计划。非灾区有些地方提出了争取每亩早稻多收二十斤、每人多种五分田来支援灾区的口号。
    据新华社广州23日电　广州市两百万人民全力参加西江、北江和珠江三角洲抗洪斗争。为防止发生意外情况，广州市区也进行了必要的抗洪抗浸的准备工作。
    这几天，广州市的车站、码头，日日夜夜都有满载防洪器材和急需物资的火车、汽车、船只向北江大堤、流溪河和珠江三角洲等受洪水威胁的地区源源开去。此外，全市还以大量人力、技术力量投入防洪斗争。广州市建筑部门九百多人刚到北江大堤上就立刻和农民兄弟并肩投入加固堤围的战斗。
