Give Full Play to the Role of Waterway Transportation
　　Giving full play to the role of waterway transportation, and making more use of waterway transportation for bulk cargo, is an important measure to alleviate the current transportation tension and meet the needs of national economic development.
　　Since the fourth quarter of last year, railway transportation has been overloaded. In terms of road transportation, automobile transportation is restricted by the existing transport capacity and material supply, and private transportation tools are also overloaded due to insufficient labor. However, waterway transportation still has surplus capacity and has not been fully utilized. Although the imbalance between land and water transportation, with overloaded land transportation and underutilized waterway transportation, has changed somewhat in the first quarter of this year, the potential of waterway transportation is still very large. Faced with this situation, we should pay attention to making more use of waterway transportation.
　　The potential of waterway transportation has not been fully realized. On the one hand, it is true that the business management of waterway transportation enterprises has not fully adapted to the needs of the development of the transportation situation, and the water transportation industry also lacks the necessary technological transformation; on the other hand, some comrades do not have enough understanding of the advantages of waterway transportation, and neglecting the full use of waterway transportation is also an important reason. Our country is a country with very good natural conditions for waterway transportation, with a coastline of more than 10,000 kilometers and natural rivers of more than 400,000 kilometers. This is a broad transportation road opened up for us by nature. Using waterways to organize transportation has many advantages: First, the cost is low and the amount of labor consumed is relatively small; second, the construction investment is saved, and it does not require the use of a large amount of steel, which is of special economic significance in the current situation where metal materials in our country are still in short supply; third, the channel throughput is large, the ship carrying capacity is large, and the horsepower traction effect is high, which is unmatched by all land transportation tools; fourth, the construction of water transportation can be considered in combination with water conservancy construction and electric power industry construction, and the effect of comprehensive utilization of water resources can be brought into play. Of course, our talk about the advantages of waterway transportation here does not mean belittling the advantages of other transportation methods in the slightest. There is no doubt that railways are the main force of domestic transportation in our country. The flexibility of automobile transportation is also universally recognized. We just want to illustrate that since our country is a country with a long coastline and many rivers, with good conditions for the development of waterway transportation, and waterway transportation has many advantages, and the strength of waterway transportation has not been fully utilized at present, while using railway, road and air transportation, it is also necessary to pay attention to making more use of waterway transportation.
　　Why are some comrades unwilling to use waterway transportation? Their reason is that the continuity of waterway transportation is relatively poor at present, and there are still some inconveniences. This is a shortcoming in the business management of water transport enterprises. Therefore, to give full play to the role of waterway transportation and make more use of water transportation for bulk materials, water transport enterprises must also start with improving business management. It should be affirmed that the business management level of water transport enterprises in our country has been improving year by year, but there are indeed some imperfections. For example, during the transportation process of goods, there are many transshipments in transit between the coast and inland rivers, and between the main streams and tributaries, and the continuity of transportation is poor; after the ships arrive at the port, the waiting time for loading or unloading is too long, and the transportation efficiency is not high. These make it impossible to reduce costs and freight rates further, and it is difficult to increase the amount of bulk cargo shipped. In order to change this situation, water transport enterprises in various places should actively organize direct transportation and develop water-land combined transportation business. Port enterprises in various places must make the greatest efforts to improve cargo handling efficiency, speed up ship turnaround, and promote water transport to continue to reduce costs and freight rates. According to the transportation situation in the first quarter of this year, it seems that water transport and port enterprises that pay attention to improving business management and loading and unloading work have greatly improved transportation efficiency, and the proportion of water transport can grow rapidly. The experience of the Hunan Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration proves this point. Last year, due to the long time ships spent waiting for loading and unloading at ports, and the excessive non-productive berthing time, the strength of waterway transportation could not be fully utilized. This year, they conscientiously improved the business management of enterprises and ports, greatly improved transportation efficiency, and from January to April, water transportation accounted for 89% of the total cargo transportation volume of highways and waterways.
　　Improving business management is not only a matter of strengthening organizational leadership, but also requires technical transformation of the water transport industry. In the past ten years, the water transport industry in our country has been thriving and has achieved a lot of construction achievements. However, according to the needs of national economic development, the material and technical conditions of the water transport industry still need to be greatly improved. At present, there are not many ports with modern equipment on the more than 10,000 kilometers of coastline in our country; among the 400,000 kilometers of natural rivers, only 150,000 kilometers are navigable; the number of modern tugboats is also very small, most of the local inland river ships are old, and mainly rely on wooden sailing ships for transportation; the technical equipment of many waterways and small and medium-sized ports is very backward. In order to change this situation, we need to gradually strengthen the technical transformation of the water transport industry. In terms of ships, we must find ways to add new ships, strengthen the motorization of wooden sailing ships, and give full play to the efficiency of existing ships to increase transport capacity. Now, compared with the transport capacity of ships, the throughput capacity of ports is an even weaker link. For this reason, we must pay close attention to the construction of ports, warehouses and storage yards, and realize semi-mechanization and mechanization of loading and unloading. In terms of waterways, according to the principle of comprehensive utilization of water resources, combined with farmland irrigation and hydropower generation, we should actively build new waterways, and pay attention to actively transforming existing waterways. With the continuous improvement of the material and technical conditions of the water transport industry, the efficiency of waterway transportation will be greatly improved, and the strength of waterway transportation can be more fully utilized.
　　From a long-term perspective, in order to enable waterway transportation to play a greater role in the national economy, it is also necessary to solve the problem of combining industrial layout with waterway transportation network. When planning the industrial layout, industrial production departments should consider making full use of the advantages of waterway transportation and set up factories along the river under possible conditions. This is extremely beneficial economically, as it can solve transportation problems and also solve industrial water and drainage problems.
　　In order to give full play to the strength of waterway transportation, in addition to correcting the thinking of some comrades in the material consignment department who neglect water transportation, in addition to water transport and port enterprises improving business management and material and technical conditions, there must also be arrangements in the transportation plan to comprehensively utilize various transportation methods such as railways, highways, and water transportation. Transportation command departments at all levels should plan the rational flow of goods, make full use of those sea and river routes that are parallel to or in the same direction as railways, and hand over bulk long-distance transportation of goods to water transport enterprises on sea and river routes as much as possible to reduce the burden on railway transportation. In local transportation, we must also make full use of inland river routes that are parallel to or in the same direction as highways to reduce the burden on highway transportation. At present, river water levels are rising, waterway water depth is smooth, and throughput capacity has greatly increased, which is a great opportunity to use water transportation. Provinces and regions with abundant water resources must seize this opportunity to make more use of waterway transportation.

### 充分发挥水路运输的作用

    充分发挥水路运输的作用
    充分发挥水路运输的作用，使大宗货物更多地利用水路运输，是缓和当前运输紧张情况，满足国民经济发展需要的一项重要措施。
    自从去年第四季度以来，铁路运输一直是负荷过重的。公路运输方面，汽车运输受现有运力和物料供应的限制，民间运输工具受劳动力不足的影响，也同样处于负荷过重的状态。但是，水路运输却还有富裕的能力，并没有充分利用起来。这种陆路负荷过重，水路利用不足的水陆运输之间的不平衡情况，在今年第一季度虽然有所改变，但是水路运输的潜力仍然是很大的。面对着这样的情况，我们应该注意更多地利用水路运输。
    水路运输潜力没有得到充分发挥，一方面固然是由于水路运输企业经营管理还没有充分适应运输形势发展的需要，水运事业也还缺乏应有的技术改造；而另一方面，有些同志对水路运输的优越性认识不足，忽视对水路运输的充分利用，也是一个重要原因。我国是一个水路运输的自然条件很好的国家，海岸线长达一万多公里，天然河道长达四十多万公里。这是大自然为我们开拓的广阔的运输道路。利用水路来组织运输具有很多优越性：其一是成本低廉，所耗用的劳动量比较少；其二是建设的投资节省，不需要使用大量钢材，这在目前我国金属材料还很不足的情况下，有特殊重要的经济意义；其三是航道通过能力大，船舶儎运能量多，马力牵引效用高，为一切陆上运输工具所不及，其四是水运事业的建设可以同水利建设和电力工业建设结合起来考虑，发挥综合利用水利资源的效果。当然，我们在这里大谈水路运输的优越性，丝毫也不意味着贬低其他各种运输方式的长处。毫无疑问，铁路是我国国内运输的主要力量。汽车运输的机动灵活，也是一致公认的。我们只是要说明：既然我们的国家是一个海岸线漫长的、多河流的国家，有着发展水路运输的良好条件，水路运输又有很多优越性，而目前水路运输的力量还没有被充分利用，我们在利用铁路、公路和航空运输的同时，也就有必要注意多多利用水路运输。
    为什么有些同志不愿意利用水路运输呢？他们的理由是目前水路运输的连续性比较差，还有不够便捷之处。这是水运企业的经营管理上的缺点。因而充分发挥水路运输的作用，使大宗物资更多地利用水运，还要水运企业从改善经营管理着手。应当肯定，我国水运企业的经营管理水平是逐年有所提高的，但是确实还有不够完善的地方。例如，货物在运输过程中，在沿海与内河之间以及干流与支流之间，中途转运次数多，运输连续性较差；船舶到港以后，等待装货或卸货时间过长，运输效率不高。这些使成本和运价不能有更多的降低，大宗托运货物难以增加。为了改变这种情况，各地水运企业，应当积极组织直达运输，开展水陆联运业务。各地港口企业，要以最大的努力去提高货物装卸效率，加快船舶周转速度，并促使水路运输继续降低成本和运价。根据今年第一季度的运输情况看来，凡是注重改进经营管理和装卸工作的水运和港口企业，运输效率就有很大的提高，水路运输的比重就能迅速增长。湖南省内河航运管理局的经验就证明了这一点。去年，他们由于船舶到港口待装卸的时间多，属于非生产性的停泊时间过长，水路运输的力量不能充分发挥。今年他们认真改进企业和港口的经营管理，大大提高了运输效率，1至4月份，水运在公路与水运货物运输总量中已占89％。
    改善经营管理，不只是一个加强组织领导的问题，而且还需要对水运事业进行技术改造。十年以来，我国水运事业欣欣向荣，已经有了不少的建设成就。但是根据国民经济发展需要来看，水运事业的物质技术状况还是需要大力改善的。目前，在我国一万多公里的海岸线上，有现代化设备的港口还不多；四十多万公里天然河道中，能通航的只有十五万公里；现代化的轮驳船数量也很少，地方内河大多数船舶老旧，主要依靠木帆船运输；许多航道和中小港口的技术装备非常落后。为了改变这种情况，就需要我们逐步加强水运事业的技术改造。在船舶方面，要设法添置新的轮船，加强木帆船机动化，充分发挥现有船舶的效能，以增加运输能力。现在，同船舶的运输能力比较起来，港口的通过能力更是一个薄弱环节。为此，要十分注意港口、仓库和堆场的建设，实现装卸半机械化和机械化。在航道方面，要根据综合利用水利资源的原则，结合农田灌溉、水力发电，积极建设新的航道，并注意对现有的航道积极进行改造。随着水运事业物质技术条件的不断改善，水路运输的效率必能大大提高，水路运输的力量也就可以得到更充分的利用。
    从长远来看，要使水路运输在国民经济中发挥更大的作用，还要解决一个工业布局与水路运输网相结合的问题。工业生产部门在规划工业布局的时候，应当考虑到充分利用水路运输的优越性，在可能条件下，沿河设厂。这样做，在经济上是极为有利的，既可以解决运输问题，又可以解决工业用水和排水的问题。
    充分利用水路运输的力量，除了要端正物资托运部门有些同志忽视水运的思想，除了水运和港口企业改善经营管理和物质技术条件之外，还要在运输计划上有所安排，对铁路、公路和水运等各种运输方式实行综合利用。各级运输指挥部门要规划货物的合理流向，充分利用那些同铁路平行或同方向的江海航线，尽可能地把大宗的长距离运输的货物，交给江海航线的水运企业去承担，以减轻铁路运输的负荷。在地方运输上，也要充分利用那些同公路平行或同方向的内河航线，以减轻公路运输的负荷。目前，河流水位上升，航道水深流畅，通过能力大为增加，正是利用水运的大好时机。凡是多水的省区，都要抓紧这一时机更多地利用水路运输。
