Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The head of the Colombian Congressional Delegation, Rodriguez, and the deputy head, Franco, today spoke to Xinhua reporters about their impressions of their visit to China.

The distinguished guests of the Colombian Congressional Delegation returned to Beijing today after visiting Shanghai. When the two leaders of the delegation met with our agency's reporters at the Beijing Hotel, they first expressed their highest respect to all the Chinese people.

Rodriguez began his talk by telling the reporter: "China is a surprise to me, and a very pleasant surprise." He then said: "The progress China has made in developing its economy, culture, and improving the people's living standards is unexpected."

He said: "During the ten days in China, I noticed that the Chinese people are hardworking and diligent. They are satisfied with the new system they have established. They have a high degree of collectivism and individual responsibility. They love their country and they love peace. I especially noticed that the Chinese people are very united. Take the Ming Tombs Reservoir as an example. This reservoir was entirely built by voluntary labor. The people who participated in the voluntary labor included China's highest-ranking leaders and ordinary people. This is a very good example."

"China is undergoing a tremendous transformation, developing in a better direction, and this is reflected in the political system and economic culture."

Mr. Rodriguez is a Colombian Liberal Party senator and the president of the Academy of Sciences, and is a reputable scholar in Colombia. When talking about the friendship between the two countries, he said, "I believe that there should be nothing but close friendship between the people of Colombia and China, because the people of both countries love peace very much."

"I hope that in the near future, this friendly relationship will turn into closer economic and cultural ties, and that these economic and cultural ties will become the foundation for further developing the friendship between the two countries."

He said: "After a short visit to China, I have no hesitation in saying that I will become a staunch supporter of developing friendship between Colombia and China."

Deputy head Franco is a Colombian Conservative Party congressman and a jurist. He told reporters: "Although our stay in China was short, we saw the development that the Chinese people have achieved in construction over the past ten years, we saw the improvement in the lives of Chinese workers, and we saw the progress of Beijing in terms of material and culture." He said, "I believe that China's economic strength will greatly increase in the near future."

Mr. Franco repeatedly emphasized the need to develop friendship between Colombia and China in his conversation. He said: "The Colombian people very much hope to strengthen economic and cultural relations with China." "One of the important tasks of this congressional delegation's visit to China is to promote economic and cultural ties and government relations between Colombia and China."

Both head Rodriguez and deputy head Franco expressed their gratitude for the warm reception they received from all aspects of China during their talks.

    哥伦比亚议会代表团正副团长谈访华观感
    希望发展哥中两国经济文化联系
    新华社22日讯　哥伦比亚议会代表团团长罗德里格斯、副团长佛朗哥今天分别向新华社记者畅谈访华观感。
    哥伦比亚议会代表团的贵宾们访问上海以后今天回到北京，代表团的两位领导人在北京饭店接见本社记者的时候，他们首先向全体中国人民表示崇高的敬意。
    罗德里格斯谈话一开始就对记者说：“中国，对我来说是一种惊奇，而且是一种非常愉快的惊奇。”他接着说：“中国在发展经济、文化和提高人民生活水平方面取得的进步，是出乎意料之外的。”
    他说：“在中国的十天中间，我注意到：中国人民是勤劳的、努力的，他们对自己建立起来的新制度是满意的，他们有高度的集体主义思想和个人责任心，他们热爱祖国，也热爱和平。我特别注意到中国人民是非常团结的。拿十三陵水库为例，这个水库全部是用义务劳动来建成的，参加义务劳动的人，有中国的最高级的领导人，也有普通的人民，这是一个很好的榜样。”
    “中国正在有一个巨大的转变，在向着更好的方向发展，表现在政治制度和经济文化方面都是这样的。”
    罗德里格斯先生是哥伦比亚自由党参议员和科学院院长，是哥伦比亚负有声望的学者。在谈到两国友谊的时候，他说：“我认为哥伦比亚和中国人民之间除了紧密的友谊以外，不应该有别的，因为两国人民都是非常热爱和平的。”
    “我希望不久的将来，这种友谊关系会变为更紧密的经济和文化之间的联系，而这种经济和文化之间的联系，又将成为更进一步发展两国友谊的基础。”
    他说：“在中国短短的访问之后，我毫不犹豫地说，我将变成为发展哥伦比亚和中国友谊的坚决拥护者。”
    副团长佛朗哥先生是哥伦比亚保守党众议员和法学家。他告诉记者说：“在中国逗留的时间很短，但是我们看到了中国人民近十年来在建设中所取得的发展，看到了中国工人生活的改善，看到了北京在物质、文化方面的进步。”他说，“我相信中国的经济力量在不久将来就会大大增长。”
    佛朗哥先生在谈话中一再强调要发展哥伦比亚和中国的友谊。他说：“哥伦比亚人民很希望加强同中国在经济、文化方面的关系。”“这次议会代表团访问中国的重要任务之一，就是为了促进哥伦比亚和中国在经济、文化联系和政府之间的联系。”
    罗德里格斯团长和佛朗哥副团长在谈话中对中国各方面对他们的热情接待，表示感谢。
