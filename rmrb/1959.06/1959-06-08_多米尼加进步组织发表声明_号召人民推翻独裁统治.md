　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 5th: According to TASS, New York, the Dominican Republic progressive organizations "Dominican Patriotic Union" and "Voice of Free Dominicans" recently published a statement in the Cuban "Hoy" newspaper, calling on the Dominican people to "strive to liberate the entire people from dictatorial tyranny as soon as possible."

　　The statement pointed out that at present, an atmosphere of terror shrouds the entire Dominican Republic. The Trujillo government brutally persecutes all those who oppose the dictatorial regime and strive for the restoration of freedom and democracy. Not long ago, assassins hired by the dictator killed five young people in Bonao, simply because they wrote slogans calling for the overthrow of the dictatorship. A few days ago, the dictator's henchmen tortured to death anti-dictatorial fighter and university student Martinez in a torture chamber, and hung his body in the central park of the capital for public display.

    多米尼加进步组织发表声明
    号召人民推翻独裁统治
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社纽约5日讯：多米尼加共和国进步组织
  “多米尼加爱国联盟”和“自由多米尼加人之声”最近在古巴“今日报”上发表声明，号召多米尼加人民“争取尽快地使全国人民从独裁暴政下解放出来”。
    声明指出，目前，恐怖气氛笼罩了整个多米尼加。特鲁希略政府残暴地迫害一切反对独裁政权、争取恢复自由和民主的人。不久前，独裁者雇用的凶手在博纳奥杀害了五名青年，仅仅因为他们写了号召推翻独裁的标语。几天前，独裁者的爪牙又在刑讯室里折磨死了反独裁战士、大学生马丁尼斯，并把他的尸首挂在首都中心公园示众。
