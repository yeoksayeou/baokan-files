Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 7th: The more than 28 million mu of early rice in Guangdong Province, except for a very small portion that has been flooded, is generally growing well, is currently heading and flowering, and some has gradually ripened. According to relevant departments, if there are no major disasters in the next 20 to 30 days, a bumper harvest is expected.

Currently, in the vast fields from the Chaoshan Plain in the east to the Shiwan Mountains in the west, from Hainan Island in the south to the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong, the rice waves are rolling, and the fragrance of rice is intoxicating, presenting a magnificent picture before the harvest. Farmers in various places generally reflect that this year's early rice is growing better than last year. According to surveys in various places, there are generally around 300,000 panicles per mu. The millions of mu of early rice in the Chaoshan Plain, China's famous high-yield rice area, are growing particularly strong. The farmers here believe that if there are no major natural disasters this year, the yield per unit area of early rice will still be higher than last year's bumper harvest. The early rice in the Xinhui, Zhongshan, Nanhai, Fanshun and other counties in the Pearl River Delta is also generally growing vigorously.

In about twenty days, the entire province will enter the busy harvest season. In order to get all the fruits of the harvest, the farmers in various places are making persistent efforts to strengthen late-stage field management and carry out the struggle to prevent floods and flood control. At the same time, the people's communes are also actively deploying troops and generals, organizing summer harvest and summer planting teams, rushing to repair various tools, building grain workshops and preparing warehouses, etc., to meet the imminent battle of summer harvest and summer planting. In addition, many people's communes have also mobilized the masses to jointly discuss and formulate summer harvest and summer planting plans and specific methods for careful harvesting and careful threshing, requiring that not a single grain of grain or a single blade of grass be lost.

    抽穗扬花　稻香千里
    广东各公社组织队伍抢修工具准备收割
    本报广州7日电　广东省二千八百多万亩早稻，除极少部分受浸外，一般生长良好，正在抽穗扬花，有些已陆续黄熟。据有关部门说，今后二、三十天内如无特大灾害，可望获得丰收。
    目前，在东起潮汕平原，西至十万大山，南从海南岛，北到粤北山区的广阔田野上，稻浪起伏，稻香醉人，呈现一幅丰收前的瑰丽图景。各地农民普遍反映说，今年的早稻生长得比去年好。据各地调查，一般每亩都在三十万穗左右。我国著名的水稻高产区——潮汕平原的数百万亩早稻生长得特别壮旺。这里的农民认为，今年如果没有特大自然灾害，早稻的单位面积产量仍将高过大丰收的去年。珠江三角洲的新会、中山、南海、番顺等县的早稻，也普遍生长茁壮。
    再过二十天左右，全省就要进入收割大忙了。为了把丰收果实全部拿到手，各地农民正一鼓作气，加强后期田间管理和开展防洪防汛的斗争。与此同时，各人民公社也正积极调兵遣将，组织夏收夏种队伍，突击抢修各种工具，修建谷坊和进行备仓等工作，迎接迫在眉睫的夏收夏种的战斗。此外，许多人民公社还发动群众共同讨论和制定夏收夏种方案和细收细打的具体办法，要求做到不丢一粒粮，不丢一根草。　（杨文全）（附图片）
