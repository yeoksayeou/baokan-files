    Communicating Across Thousands of Rivers and Mountains
    Connecting All Directions
    National Waterway Network Planning Work Fully Launched

    (Our report) The national waterway network planning work has been launched nationwide.

    The waterway network planning mainly requires proposing the layout of national waterway routes, grading standards for channels, and the arrangement and development scale of ports, ships, and shipyards. According to the Ministry of Communications' plan, the entire work will be carried out in three stages. The first stage is to organize manpower, prepare materials, and promote the entire work. The second stage is for each province to conduct economic surveys or survey channels, analyze calculations, and compile the waterway network plan for each province. The third stage is to comprehensively balance, discuss and study to finalize the plan. A national waterway network planning conference will be held in the third quarter. It is estimated that the entire work can be completed in the fourth quarter.

    In order to do a good job in this task, the Ministry of Communications has established a National Waterway Network Planning Office, with Southern, Northern, and Maritime groups. In addition to the personnel of the Ministry of Communications, more than 100 people from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, Wuhan Water Transportation Engineering Institute, Dalian Maritime College, and Shijiazhuang Normal College are participating. Each province has also established a waterway network planning office or planning group.

    The work in the southern provinces started earlier. After several months of efforts, some provinces have already submitted preliminary drafts of the waterway network report and started the comprehensive balancing work of the waterway network planning of the southern provinces. In most northern provinces, the economic survey and indoor calculation work of channels and ports have also been completed, and the compilation of the planning report has begun.

    The coastal maritime planning is an integral part of the national waterway network planning. The Beiyang and South China maritime planning work are respectively carried out by the Shanghai Maritime Bureau and Guangdong Province.

    全国水运网规划工作全面展开
    本报讯　全国水运网规划工作已在全国范围展开。
    水运网规划主要是要求提出全国水运航线的布局、航道分级标准，以及港口、船舶、船厂的布置和发展规模。根据交通部的计划，整个工作将分三个阶段进行。第一阶段是组织人力，准备资料，把整个工作推动起来；第二阶段是各省分别进行经济调查或查勘航道，分析计算，编制各省水运网规划；第三阶段是综合平衡，讨论研究定案。第三季度内将召开一次全国水运网规划会议。估计整个工作可在第四季度完成。
    为了作好这项工作，交通部成立了全国水运网规划办公室，并分别设有南方组、北方组及海运组。除交通部人员参加以外，还有中国科学院、北京大学、武汉水运工程学院、大连海运学院、石家庄师范学院共一百多人参加。各省也成立了水运网规划办公室或规划组。
    南方各省工作开展较早，经过几个月的努力，目前有的省已经提出水运网报告初稿，并着手进行南方各省水运网规划的综合平衡工作。北方大部分省的经济调查及航道港口室内计算工作也已经完成，开始规划报告的编制。
    沿海海运规划是全国水运网规划的组成部分，北洋及华南海运规划工作，分别由上海海运局和广东省负责进行。
