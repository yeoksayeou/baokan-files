Children, Like Flowers, Need Careful Nurturing
B. Pishik, Director of the Editorial Office of the "Soviet Woman" Magazine

    I have an old friend—a woman dedicated to the medical care of pediatric diseases. She retired long ago. However, like all people with magnanimous hearts, she is unwilling to be idle. She believes, according to Gorky, that a person's glorious duty on Earth is to act constantly. Although no one requires her to go to work early every day, and although long journeys are no longer easy for her, she still spares no effort for things, whether near or far.
    She recently returned from a collective farm in Tambov Oblast.
    "What did you go there for?" I asked her when we met.
    "Oh, it's really interesting," she replied, spreading a bundle of notes, photos, charts, and sketches on the table.
    "Thirty years ago, I worked there as a pediatrician. At that time, the first collective farms were just being established. Look, this narrow and not-so-clean little river is where they get their water. The farmers' children often played in a small corner behind the house. Cooked sheep bones were their toys. Look at how big the hat is on this child's head; it's probably his father's hat. A jar filled with oil and a wick was our one and only source of lighting. Look at this one," she said, placing a photo yellowed by age in front of me, "This is a child with trachoma."
      "Lida, that's history already," I said.
      "Yes, it's history for us. It's also history for the formerly desolate Tambov Oblast. However, do all people understand how much effort we older generation people put into creating the life that young people take for granted today! I want to write a book narrating the thousands upon thousands of lives that were saved, how the countryside got clean water, nurseries, and kindergartens, how rural women no longer seek midwives for childbirth, and how rural children have their favorite books and toys."
    "Books and toys are no longer within the scope of medicine," I wanted to clarify my friend's intention.
    "You're right," she said, "Isn't it because we have not only healed their bodies but also healed their souls all these years that generations of healthy children are developing and growing up now? No, it's not just the credit of us doctors. If it weren't for the October Revolution, wouldn't we be like those talented but unsuccessful doctors in the Tsarist era, accomplishing nothing? I think the reason why children can grow up healthily should first be attributed to our country, which cares for the physical and mental health of children with such loving hearts!"
    At this time, she continued:
    "Think about it, how many scholars and doctors in the world are engaged in research, trying to save children from the harm of polio and dysentery, trying to eradicate smallpox, and reduce tuberculosis, cancer, and many other diseases. But at the same time, the air is being poisoned by radioactive rays. We can hardly imagine how harmful radioactive strontium will be to us and the next generation!"
    As she said these words, she resolutely gathered the records, photos, and charts from the table and stuffed them into separate folders. One of the folders contained her large number of manuscripts.
    Can this woman, nearly eighty years old, complete her new work? Can she finish the chapter of her anger towards strontium? No one knows whether she has the strength to achieve her goal, but this woman has done so much for the happiness of children together with the people. Therefore, her image appears particularly amiable and approachable on this Children's Day.
    Nine years ago, the delegates to the First World Conference for the Defense of Children in Vienna—educators, doctors, teachers, workers, fathers, and mothers—celebrated "June 1st" International Children's Day. These past years have brought many new things to mankind. The war in Korea has ceased. The scandalous provocations on the Suez Canal ended in the shameful defeat of the troublemakers. The first Soviet artificial earth satellites appeared in space. Soviet space rockets are flying along the sun...
    Although June 1st is a day of happiness for children, it is still a day for defending children. Algerian children are hiding from napalm bombs, and children in Africa live in hot thatched huts. Hundreds of thousands of children in Latin America who are eager for knowledge are denied access to schools. Even the official statistical agencies of the United States have to admit that many children in the United States are still in hunger, they do not have the right to education, are trapped in the abyss of sin, and live in mental hospitals.
    No, rational and upright people cannot remain calm. They cherish our old mother—the Earth. What will it be like in twenty, thirty, fifty, or a hundred years? Will future people be able to go to other planets? Can the desert become a blooming garden? Can diseases disappear? Can the unbreakable fraternal friendship among the people of all countries in the world be realized? It must be known that this depends on our production of pig iron and steel, the yield of grains, and the publication of books. It depends on everything we do for children, for their health, learning, and education.
    My motherland firmly believes that our ideas—fraternal friendship, equality, and true human freedom—can be victorious. However, it is unwilling to use either atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs to solve historical problems. Therefore, it declares: Let us ban the testing of deadly weapons! Let us jointly and permanently ban its testing! Strontium not only poisons the atmosphere but also harms human relationships. As long as people continue to put it in the sky, on the ground, and in the water, children will not be safe. Let us replace the production of bombs containing deadly radiation with the construction of schools, maternity hospitals, nurseries, and clubs—incubators of health, happiness, and reason! The effects can be seen quickly, and it has already been demonstrated in the Soviet Union.
    Readers, have you seen the preliminary summary of the Soviet population census in January 1959? Please allow me to tell you that the number of marriages in the Soviet Union is now the highest: on average, the number of marriages per year exceeds twelve couples per thousand residents. Over the past forty years, the birth rate in the Soviet Union has greatly increased; now, on average, the number of newborns per year exceeds twenty-five per thousand people. The mortality rate in the Soviet Union is the lowest in the world; on average, the number of deaths per thousand people is seven point five. Compared with the pre-revolutionary period, the population mortality rate in the Soviet Union has decreased by three-quarters, and the child mortality rate has decreased by six-sevenths!
    Dear readers, even if you are not economists or sociologists, but ordinary fathers or mothers, these figures will convey a lot to your hearts. The number of marriages is high because people do not have to worry about the future—tomorrow will be the same as today, they will have work and housing, and increasingly improved amenities. The birth rate is high because no one is afraid of "one more mouth to feed." The infant mortality rate continues to decline because we have forgotten the emaciated faces of hungry children, and because not only doctors but also the entire society are engaged in the prevention and treatment of children's diseases. This is primarily manifested in: the creation of healthy living conditions for all children in cities and villages, in the capital and in the so-called former suburbs, regardless of skin color.
    Just as Comrade Khrushchev said at the Twenty-First Party Congress, we are prepared to greatly increase the role of the state and society in educating children, and the state and society will strengthen assistance to families. For these purposes, boarding schools, nurseries, and kindergartens will be built on a large scale. In 1965, the number of students in boarding schools will be no less than 2.5 million. During the seven-year plan, the number of children in kindergartens will increase from 2.28 million to 4.2 million.
    Gorky called children "the flowers of life." Everyone knows that flowers can only bloom when the rubble and weeds in the soil are cleared. They stretch their buds towards the bright sunshine and timely rain. Flowers need the careful cultivation of diligent gardeners. Mankind should become such gardeners.
    This is what I thought of on this International Children's Day.

### 孩子们像花朵一样，需要精心的培育

    孩子们像花朵一样，需要精心的培育
    “苏联妇女”杂志总编室主任　B·皮希克
    我有一位老朋友——一位献身于儿科病医疗事业的妇女。她早就告老退休了。然而，她和一切心情豪放的人一样，不愿意闲着不作事。她认为，根据高尔基的说法，在地球上作为一个人，他的光荣职责就是不停地行动。尽管没有人要求她每天早天上班工作，尽管漫长的旅行对于她已不是轻松的事，但她对于无论远近的事情，仍然不辞辛劳。
    她最近才从坦博夫州的集体农庄回来。
    “你到那儿做什么去了？”我们见面时，我问她。
    “噢，这可真有趣极了，”她回答说，一面把一捆笔记、照片、图表、速写画摊在桌上。
    “三十年前我在那里当过小儿科医生。那时候，第一批集体农庄刚创办起来。瞧，这条狭窄而不大洁净的小河就是他们取水的地方。农民的孩子们就常在住宅后面的一个小角落里玩耍。煮过的羊骨头就是他们的玩具。瞧，这孩子头上戴着一顶多么大的帽子，这大概是他父亲的帽子。盛上油和放上一根灯芯的罐子，这就是我们唯一无二的照明工具。你再瞧这一张，”她把一张因年代久远而变黄了的照片放在我面前，接着说，“这是一个害了沙眼的孩子。”
      “丽达，这已经是历史了，”我说。
      “是的，对我们来说，这已经是历史了。对从前满目荒凉的坦博夫州来说，也是历史了。然而，是否所有的人都了解，我们老一辈的人为了创造今天青年人所习以为常的生活，费了多么大的劲啊！我想写一本书，叙述成千上万被救活了的生命，农村怎样有了清洁的水、托儿所、幼儿园，农妇分娩已不再去找接生婆，农村的孩子有了自己喜爱的书籍和玩具。”
    “书呀，玩具呀，这已经不属于医学的范围了，”我想弄清我朋友的意图。
    “你的话不错，”她说，“现在我们的一代又一代健康的孩子在发育、成长，难道不是因为我们这些年来，不仅医治了他们的肉体，而且医治了他们的灵魂吗？不，这不仅仅是我们做医生的功劳。如果不是十月革命，我们不是和那些在沙皇时代很有才华而一事无成的医生一样，没有什么作为吗？我想，孩子们所以能够健康地成长，首先应当归功于我们的国家，它是以怎样的慈爱的胸怀关心着孩子们的身心健康啊！”
    这时，她接着说：
    “想想吧，世界上有多少学者和医生正在从事研究工作，他们要使儿童免遭脊髓灰质炎症和痢疾之害，他们要消灭天花，减少肺结核、癌症以及其他许许多多疾病。可是，也就在这同时，空气受到放射性线所毒害。我们简直想像不到，放射性的锶对我们和下一代会有多么大的害处！”
    她在说这些话时，坚决地从桌上把这些记录、照片和图表收拾起来，并把它们分别塞到纸夹里去。其中有一个纸夹里放着她的大批的手稿。
    这位年近八十岁的妇人能够完成她的新著作吗？她能不能写完她对于锶的愤怒的一章呢？谁也不知道，她有没有力量能够达到她的目的，但是，这位妇女和人民一起为孩子们的幸福做了这么多的事情。因此她的形象在保卫儿童的这个节日里，显得特别和霭可亲。
    九年以前，参加维也纳第一届世界保卫儿童大会的代表——教育家、医生、教师、工人、父亲们和母亲们庆祝了“六一”国际儿童节，过去的这些年代给人类带来了很多新的东西。朝鲜的战火停熄了。苏伊士运河上骇人听闻的挑衅以肇事者的可耻失败而告结束了。宇宙间出现了苏联第一批人造地球卫星。苏联宇宙火箭正在沿着太阳飞行……。
    虽然，6月1日是儿童幸福的日子，但是这天也仍然是保卫儿童的节日。阿尔及利亚的儿童在躲避着凝固汽油弹，非洲大地上孩子们居住在酷热的草屋里。拉丁美洲成千上万渴求知识的儿童被拒绝在学校的门外。甚至美国官方统计机关也不得不承认，美国有许多儿童仍处在饥饿之中，他们得不到受教育的权利，陷在罪恶的深渊里，住在精神病院里。
    不，有理性的、正直的人是不可能保持平静的。他们珍爱我们的老妈妈——地球。二十年，三十年，五十年，一百年以后，它将成为什么样呢？未来的人能到其他行星上去吗？荒漠能变成百花盛开的花园吗？疾病能消失吗？世界上各国人民之间的牢不可破的兄弟友谊能实现吗？要知道，这取决于我们的生铁和钢的产量、五谷的产量、书籍的出版量。取决于我们为儿童，为他们的健康、学习和教育所做的一切工作。
    我的祖国深信，我们的思想——兄弟友谊、平等、真正的人类自由能获得胜利。但是，它不愿利用无论是原子弹、或是氢弹来解决历史的问题。因此它声明：让我们禁止试验致命的武器吧！让我们共同永久地禁止它的试验吧！锶，不仅毒害大气，而且也伤害人的关系。只要人们还把它弄到天上、地里和水中，儿童就没有安全。让我们以建筑学校、产院、托儿所、俱乐部——健康、幸福和理智的温床来代替生产含有致命的放射线的炸弹吧！效果很快就可以看出来，它已在苏联表现出来了。
    读者们，你们看到了1959年1月苏联人口调查的初步总结了吗？请允许我告诉你们，现在苏联结婚的人数最多：平均每一千个居民中，一年内结婚的人数超过十二对。四十多年来，苏联出生率有很大的提高；现在平均每一千人中，一年内新生的人数超过二十五人。苏联死亡率是世界最低的；平均每一千人中，死亡人数是七点五人。同革命前比较，苏联人口死亡率降低了四分之三，儿童的死亡率减少了七分之六！
    亲爱的读者，即或你们不是经济学家，不是社会学家，而是普通的父亲或母亲，这些数字也会向你们的心灵道出好多东西。结婚人数多，是因为人们不必为未来的一天——明天担心；明天也将和今天一样，他们会有工作和房屋，有日益完善的方便设备。婴儿出生率所以高，是因为谁也不怕“多一张嘴”。婴儿死亡率所以不断降低，是因为我们忘记了饥饿的孩子们的憔悴面孔，是因为进行儿童疾病防治工作的，不仅有医生，而且还有整个社会。这一点首先表现在：在城市和乡村，在首都和所谓从前的郊区，为所有儿童创造了健康的生活条件，不论是什么样的肤色。
    正像赫鲁晓夫同志在第二十一次党代表大会上说的，我们准备大大提高国家和社会在教育儿童方面的作用，国家和社会将加强对家庭的帮助。为了这些目的，将大规模兴建寄宿学校、托儿所、幼儿园。1965年寄宿学校学生人数将不少于二百五十万人。在七年计划期间，幼儿园儿童人数将由二百二十八万增长到四百二十万人。
    高尔基把儿童称为“生活的花朵”。大家都知道，只有清除了土壤里的瓦砾和杂草的时候，花朵才能盛开。它们迎着灿烂的阳光和及时的甘雨抒展自己的花蕾。花朵需要勤恳的园丁的精心培育。人类就应当成为这样的园丁。
    这就是我在国际儿童节这一天所想到的。
