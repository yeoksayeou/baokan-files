Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The 1959 National Level One and Master of Sports Diving Competition concluded today. The four championships in this competition were all won by athletes from Guangdong. Liang Boxi, 20, won the men's springboard diving championship, and Li Zhende, 21, won the men's platform diving championship. Liang Xiuying, 21, won both the women's springboard diving and women's platform diving championships.

During this five-day competition, the diving skills of athletes from various regions have greatly improved compared to previous years. Not only have more newcomers achieved the standard of Level One athletes, but five new athletes have also reached the standard of Master of Sports. So far, there are ten male and female divers (seven male, three female) in our country whose diving scores have reached the standard of Master of Sports.

In the last event held today—the men's platform diving competition—all the top six finishers were athletes from Guangdong. Among them, five athletes achieved the standard of Master of Sports, and the scores of three athletes reached the Master of Sports standard for the first time.

In today's competition, Liang Boxi, last year's national champion, did not participate due to a cold. Therefore, this year's national championship was mainly contended by Liang Luoming, an 18-year-old newcomer, and Li Zhende, a Master of Sports. Liang Luoming was deducted a relatively large number of points because he failed the first attempt of a "handstand" starting position on the 10-meter platform. He finished second with a difference of 2.38 points, but his total score of 162.39 points still exceeded the Master of Sports standard. Li Zhende scored 164.77 points this time and won the championship. Liang Luoming was originally a gymnast and became interested in diving in 1957. Later, he "changed careers" to learn diving. His previous gymnastics foundation was very helpful for him to master diving techniques, so he progressed quickly. On May 31 this year, at the Guangdong Provincial Games, his platform diving score (152.576 points) reached the Master of Sports standard for the first time.

In men's platform diving, the other three athletes who achieved the Master of Sports standard were Guan Yingchi, 23 (153.5 points), Chen Naiying, 18 (149.75 points), and Lei Zhenhai, 22 (146.44 points). Zhang Weizhong, 19, finished sixth. His score of 137.81 points was also very close to the Master of Sports standard. (Photo attached)

    全国一级、健将级跳水比赛结束
    广东选手获全部冠军
    新华社11日讯　1959年全国一级、健将级跳水比赛今天全部结束。这次比赛的四项冠军，都被广东选手夺得。获得男子跳板跳水冠军的是二十岁的梁伯熙，获得男子跳台跳水冠军的是二十一岁的黎振德。二十一岁的梁秀英获得了女子跳板跳水和女子跳台跳水两项冠军。
    在这次历时五天的比赛中，各地选手的跳水技术水平比往年有了很大提高，不但有更多的新手成绩达到了一级运动员的标准，而且又新出现了五名成绩达到运动健将标准的选手。至此，我国已有十名男、女跳水运动员（七男、三女）的跳水成绩达到了运动健将标准。
    在今天举行的最后一个项目——男子跳台跳水比赛中，获得前六名的全是广东选手。其中有五名运动员的成绩都达到运动健将标准，而且有三名运动员的成绩是第一次达到运动健将标准。
    在今天的这项比赛中，去年的全国冠军梁伯熙因为感冒没有参加比赛，因此这次的全国冠军主要是由十八岁的新手梁荦明和运动健将黎振德两个人来争夺。梁荦明因为有一次在十公尺高的跳台上做“倒立”的起跳动作时，第一次没有成功，被扣了比较多的分数，最后以二点三八分之差屈居亚军，但是他的总成绩一六二点三九分仍然超过了运动健将的标准。黎振德这次的成绩是一六四点七七分，获得了冠军。梁荦明原是体操运动员，从1957年开始对跳水发生了兴趣，以后他就“改行”学跳水。原来的体操基础对他掌握跳水技术很有帮助，因此进步很快，今年5月31日在广东省运动会中，跳台跳水成绩（一五二点五七六分）就第一次达到了运动健将标准。
    在男子跳台跳水中，其他三名成绩达到运动健将标准的选手是二十三岁的关英炽（一五三点五分）、十八岁的陈乃英（一四九点七五分）和二十二岁的雷振海（一四六点四四分）。获得第六名的是十九岁的张伟忠。他的成绩是一三七点八一分，也十分接近运动健将的标准。（附图片）
