Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, Durban Dispatch: In Durban Port, South Africa, Africans continue to demonstrate against the white authorities' policy of racial discrimination.

On the 23rd, approximately 250 African women demonstrated in front of the Durban Magistrate's Court to protest the authorities' trial of 51 African women. These 51 women were arrested by police after the large-scale demonstration by Africans in Durban last week, and were charged with so-called "public violence" and sent to court.

The court announced that the arrested women were temporarily released on bail, and also announced that they would have to appear in court again next month for trial. These temporarily released women immediately joined the ranks of the demonstrators and went to the city center to participate in a rally of approximately 800 African women held there. Police used tear gas against the demonstrators.

On the same day, in Kwamashu, 50 Africans demonstrated in front of a police officer's residence to protest against their suppression. The police also used tear gas against the demonstrators and arrested five of them.

It is reported that the South African African National Congress issued a statement on the 23rd, reiterating the organization's original plan to call on all Africans in South Africa to boycott white-owned shops and entertainment venues on the 26th, resist businesses that support the white government, and hold mass rallies on the 28th to protest the authorities' policy of racial discrimination.

Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd, Sydney Dispatch: The South African Federal Government's brutal suppression of Africans in the Durban area who oppose racial discrimination has aroused widespread protests from people from all walks of life in Australia.

The Central Committee of the Australian Communist Party sent a telegram to the South African Federal Government, demanding that African people be given full equality and democratic rights.

The Australian Communist Party requested that the Australian Labor Party join it in lodging a protest.

The famous poet Dame Mary Gilmore told a reporter from the Australian Communist Party's newspaper "Tribune Weekly" that international imperialism should be held responsible for South Africa's apartheid policy and atrocities.

The Australian Waterside Workers' Federation, the Australian Sheet Metal Workers' Union, the Building Workers' Industrial Union, and other trade unions and the Eureka Youth League have all sent telegrams to protest.
