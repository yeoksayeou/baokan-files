    Smoke is More Valuable Than Gold
    Lu Ming
    Did you know? After burning one ton of coal, how much smoke is produced? According to statistics, about 3% becomes so-called "useless" smoke.
    Along with the black smoke, especially the brownish-yellow smoke from coking, it's not just fuel that's being lost. Many very, very valuable organic substances are also flying away without a trace. So, what can we actually get from one ton of black smoke ash? We can recover 900 kilograms of soft carbon black from one ton of black smoke ash, and from this carbon black, we can extract several grams of the precious rare metal germanium. Germanium is a semiconductor material and is an indispensable material for the development of long-distance control equipment, precision medical equipment, electronic computers, and other national defense and electronic industries. In addition to extracting germanium, carbon black can also supply the rubber industry to manufacture non-wear-resistant rubber, that is, to make rubber products for daily life. It can also be used to make inks and pigments. Recently, China successfully tested artificial rain, which is of great significance for agricultural production, but we must not forget that the dry ice used to make artificial rain—solid carbon dioxide—can be obtained from the cheapest coal smoke.
    We can also obtain artificial gasoline for tractors and automobiles from smoke; we can obtain saccharin—just one kilogram of it can sweeten a small river; we can obtain valuable medicines, high-grade perfumes, and brightly colored dyes. If we say that smoke is more valuable than gold, is there any doubt about that?
    Smoke is not only a "rich man," but also a "strong man"! What do we mean by that? It turns out that the smoke entering the chimney has a temperature of four or five hundred degrees. As long as there is a waste heat recovery device, it can be used to boil water and generate steam for heating, and the huge power of the steam can also turn steam turbines and start steam engines, becoming an indispensable power source for production. How much waste heat is there in one ton of coal? About one-fifth.
    But can we easily detain all the things that such a "strong man" of smoke carries? It rushes out of the chimney at a speed of more than ten meters per second. Of course, we cannot plug the chimney with a stopper, but we can ask electricity, water, and ultrasonic waves for help. As long as we put an "electric comb" or "electric rod"—that is, an electrode—in the chimney and pass a high-voltage current through it, the carbon black in the smoke will be charged with an opposite charge to the "electric comb," "electric rod," or the chimney wall under the action of the high-voltage electricity. Opposite charges are the most affectionate. When positive and negative charges meet from afar, they want to rush over and hug each other. This time, they firmly embrace the carbon black and refuse to let go. What if we ask water for help? We just need to install many nozzles in the chimney or flue to spray water mist, or let the smoke pass through perforated plates with flowing water, splashing thick foam on the plates. In this way, the water droplets or foam will stick to the legs of the carbon black, and it will never escape. So what is ultrasonic wave? Ultrasonic wave is a sound wave with a vibration frequency much greater than ordinary sound waves. Humans cannot hear it, but it is a new friend on our dust removal front. If we use an ultrasonic wave generator (such as a siren) to emit ultrasonic waves in the chimney, it will vibrate the carbon black so much that it becomes dizzy and disoriented. You bump into me, and I bump into you, like rolling a snowball, the more it bumps, the bigger it gets, and finally it becomes too big to fly and falls down.
    If we want to detain the waste heat of smoke, we only need to let it pass through a "waste heat boiler"—inside which there are many pipes through which water flows. The water captures its heat and boils, or turns into steam. The smoke itself is cooled to more than one hundred degrees, so it is not afraid of being burned when it is introduced into the dust collector.
    Are the above ideas just fantasies? No. China has already taken the first step in this regard. Last year, some gas companies and architectural design institutes started to engage in the comprehensive utilization of smoke.
    Let us imagine that if a city or industrial area has no coal smoke to pollute the air and no large or small chimneys to affect its appearance, wouldn't this be a pioneering achievement in the world?
    However, such comprehensive utilization of smoke cannot be achieved quickly by any building. For example, in Beijing, the Beijing Hotel and the Xijiao Friendship Hotel are two beautiful buildings, but unfortunately, a small section of chimney extending from the roof emits black smoke, damaging hygiene and the beauty of the buildings. As everyone knows, to effectively and thoroughly solve the coal smoke problem, only the comprehensive utilization of coal and the combination of electricity and heat production will work, that is, only the realization of coal gasification and heat supply can work.

    烟比黄金更贵重
    路明
    大家知道吗？一吨煤在燃烧以后，能产生多少烟呢？据统计，大约有3％变成了所谓“无用”的烟。
    随着黑烟特别是炼焦
    的黄褐色烟跑掉的还不仅仅是燃料，有许多非常非常宝贵的有机物，也一道飞得无影无踪了。那末，我们从一吨黑烟灰里究竟能得到些什么呢？我们可以从一吨黑烟灰里回收九百公斤的软质碳黑，而从这些碳黑里又可以提炼若干克宝贵的稀有金属锗。锗是一种半导体材料，是发展远距离控制设备、精密医疗设备、电子计算机等国防工业和电子工业的不可缺少的材料。碳黑除了可以提炼锗，还可供应橡胶工业制造非耐磨橡胶，即制做日常生活中的橡胶用品，也可以制做油墨和颜料。最近，我国试验成功了人造雨，这对农业生产有着重大的意义，可是我们不能忘记，制造人造雨用的干冰——固体二氧化碳，就可以从最廉价的煤烟中获得。
    我们还可以从烟中取得拖拉机和汽车用的人造汽油；可以取得糖精——它只要有一公斤那么多，就可以使一条小河变甜；可以取得贵重的药品、高级香水和鲜艳的染料。如果我们说，烟比黄金还贵重，这还有什么可以怀疑的吗？
    烟不仅是一个“富有者”，而且还是一个“大力士”哩。这话怎么讲呢？原来进入烟囱的烟都有四、五百度的温度，只要有回收废热的装置，就可用来烧水和产生蒸汽，供给我们取暖，而那巨大的蒸汽的力量，更可以转动汽轮机，发动蒸汽机，成为生产上不可缺少的动力了。一吨煤的废热有多少呢？大约占五分之一。
    但是，那样一个“大力士”的烟，难道就能容易地让我们把它带的东西全部扣留下来吗？它从烟囱冲出去的速度都在每秒十公尺以上。我们当然不能用塞子把烟囱塞住，但是我们可以请电、水和超声波来帮忙。只要把一把“电梳子”或“电棒”——也就是电极，放在烟囱里，通过高压电流，烟中的碳黑在高压电作用下，就带上了和“电梳子”“电棒”或烟囱壁异性的电荷，异性电荷是最亲热不过的，正电荷和负电荷老远一见面，就想扑过去拥抱，这一下可就把碳黑也给紧紧的抱住不放了。如果我们请水来帮忙呢？那只要在烟囱或烟道里安上许多喷头喷出水雾，或者让烟经过流着水的孔板，在板上溅起厚厚的水沫，这一来，水珠或水沫就沾住了碳黑的腿，它再也休想逃脱。那么什么又是超声波呢？超声波就是振动频率比一般声波大得多的声波，人是听不见的，但却是我们除尘战线的新朋友。如果我们用超声波发生器（例如警笛），在烟囱里发出超声波，就会把碳黑振动得晕头转向，你碰我，我碰你，好像滚雪球似的，越碰越大，最后终于大得再也飞不动了，就掉了下来。
    如果我们要扣留烟的废热，只需让它通过“废热锅炉”——里面有许多走水的管子，水就夺取了它的热烧开了，或者变成蒸汽。烟自己被冷却到一百多度，再引入除尘器时就不怕烧坏了。
    以上的想法是不是属于空想呢？不是。我国在这方面已经走开了第一步。去年，一些煤气公司和建筑设计院，都纷纷搞起烟的综合利用来了。
    让我们设想一下，如果一个城市或工业区，没有煤烟来污染空气，没有大大小小的烟囱影响它的容貌，这在世界上不是一个创举吗？
    但是，这样一个烟的综合利用还不是任何建筑都很快能办到的。例如在北京，北京饭店和西郊友谊宾馆是两座漂亮的大楼，只可惜从屋顶上伸出一小节烟囱冒着黑烟，把卫生和建筑的美损害了。正如大家所知，要有效和彻底的解决煤烟问题，只有煤的综合利用和生产电与生产热相结合，也就是说只有实现煤气化和热化才行。
