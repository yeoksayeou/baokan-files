Xinjiang's Various Ethnic Groups Guarantee Bumper Harvests
Tianshan Southern Region Opens the Sickle to Cut Wheat

Urumqi Dispatch from our newspaper on June 24th: Just as the good news of the summer harvest frequently comes from the Yangtze River Basin and both sides of the Yellow River, the prelude to the bumper wheat harvest in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, located in the northwest border of the motherland, has also begun. At present, on the oases in southern Tianshan, tens of thousands of farmers of all ethnic groups are working intensely, throwing themselves into the wheat harvest battle, rushing to harvest day and night. In the northern Tianshan Mountains, the wheat has begun to ripen and will be ready to be harvested soon.

The prelude to the wheat harvest battle in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was unveiled in the early-warming Turpan Basin. Then, a busy summer harvest scene appeared everywhere at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains and on the edges of the Tarim Basin. Many people's communes have implemented the method of "six to the fields," with leadership, labor, livestock, tools, threshing grounds, and canteens all brought to the fields, camping there to rush the harvest day and night. Everyone is determined to have a great harvest on the basis of a bumper harvest—reaping cleanly, threshing cleanly, and gleaning cleanly, striving to bring every grain home.

This year, Xinjiang resolutely implemented the policy of "planting more and harvesting more." The wheat planting area increased by more than 2.6 million mu compared to last year. The more than 13 million mu of wheat in the entire region are generally growing well, surpassing the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and far exceeding any previous year. In order to welcome the first bumper harvest after communization, various places began preparing for the summer harvest one or two months ago. Many counties and people's communes have established summer harvest preparation work committees and headquarters in advance to comprehensively check and arrange the summer harvest work.

Yingjisha County, which had previously proposed to all counties in the region to strive for large-scale wheat bumper harvests, has exceptionally good wheat growth. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, the county convened a meeting of the Party committee secretaries of various communes in May to check and study the preparations for the summer harvest. After the meeting, each commune calculated detailed accounts of labor, tools, and the area to be harvested. On the one hand, they drew a large number of laborers in advance to vigorously manage the autumn fields, so that 95% of the labor force could be drawn in time to participate in the wheat harvest battle. On the other hand, they organized blacksmiths and carpenters throughout the county to repair and rush to produce summer harvest tools. In order to facilitate harvesting as it ripens, each commune also arranged all the wheat fields in order of maturity, marked them with signs, and divided the labor force into specialized teams for reaping, bundling, transporting, and gleaning wheat ears according to their specialties and physical strength. Bachu County, located in the lower reaches of the Yarkand River, prepared 243 threshing grounds, 116 combine harvesters, 98 wheat threshers, and more than 38,000 pieces of scythes, stone rollers, windmills, and wooden forks in late May. The northern Xinjiang region, which starts harvesting later, also began preparing summer harvest tools more than a month earlier than in previous years.

    新疆各族人民保证丰产丰收
    天山南部开镰割麦
    本报乌鲁木齐24日电　正当长江流域和黄河两岸夏收捷报频频传来的时候，地处祖国西北边疆的新疆维吾尔自治区小麦丰收的序幕也揭开了。目前，在天山南部片片绿洲上，每天都有数以万计的各族农民，紧张的投入麦收战斗，日夜突击抢收。天山北部，小麦已开始黄熟，不日即可开镰。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的麦收战斗的序幕，是在早暖的吐鲁番盆地揭开的，接着昆仑山下以及塔里木盆地边缘各地到处呈现出一片夏收的繁忙景象。许多人民公社实行领导、劳力、牲畜、工具、麦场和食堂六到田的办法，在田边安营扎寨，日夜抢收。大家决心要在大丰产的基础上来个大丰收——割净、打净、拾净，争取颗粒还家。
    今年新疆坚决贯彻执行多种多收的方针，小麦播种面积比去年增加了二百六十多万亩。全区一千三百多万亩小麦普遍生长得好，胜过大跃进的1958年，远远超过以往任何一年。为了迎接公社化后的第一次大丰收，各地早在一两个月以前，就开始了夏收准备工作。许多县、人民公社都提前成立了夏收准备工作委员会和指挥部，全面检查和安排了夏收工作。
    年初曾向全区各县提出力争小麦大面积丰产的英吉沙县，小麦长的分外好。为了确保丰产丰收，早在5月间全县就召开了各公社的党委书记会议，检查和研究了夏收准备工作。会后各公社都将劳力、工具以及夏收面积等算了细账，一面抽出大批劳力提前大抓秋田管理，以便及时能抽出95％的劳动力参加麦收战斗；一面组织全县的铁木工修理和赶制夏收工具。为了便于随熟随收，各公社还将全部麦田按成熟迟早排了队，插上标记，并按照特长和体力强弱等将劳动力分为收割、捆、运、拣麦穗等专业队。位于叶尔羌河下游的巴楚县，在5月下旬就准备好麦场二百四十三个、收割机一百一十六架、小麦脱粒机九十八架，镰刀、石滚、风车、木?等三万八千多件。开镰较晚的北疆地区，今年也较往年提早一个多月开始准备好夏收工具。
