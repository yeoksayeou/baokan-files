Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 9th—TASS reports: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union hosted a banquet in the Grand Kremlin Palace on June 8th to welcome all members of the German Democratic Republic party and government delegation headed by Ulbricht and Grotewohl.

On the Soviet side, Aristov, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Kuusinen, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Khrushchev, Pospelov, Pervukhin, and Polyansky attended the banquet.

At the banquet, Khrushchev and Ulbricht delivered speeches.

In his speech, Khrushchev said that the visit of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic would help further consolidate cooperation between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. He pointed out that for ten years, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have been advancing side by side in peaceful construction and the struggle for peace. Khrushchev said: "We can proudly say that our friendship has stood the test of time. This friendship has played a great role in the achievements of our two peoples and in overcoming difficulties on the road to development."

Khrushchev continued that in recent years, new and more advanced forms of cooperation have gradually developed between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic—production collaboration, direct links between similar types of enterprises and scientific institutions, and joint resolution of a series of scientific and production tasks.

Khrushchev emphasized that the unity of the socialist camp is our greatest achievement, and we should protect it as we protect the apple of our eye. He pointed out that our enemies understand this very well, so their main attempt is to split the ranks of the socialist camp. In this situation, the unity of all democratic forces in the socialist camp is of particular importance. We are very pleased that in the German Democratic Republic, the National Front of Democratic Germany is successfully fulfilling this task, and in this united front, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, all democratic parties of the Republic cooperate seamlessly.

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said that the visit of the party and government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the Soviet Union is a major event for all peace-loving and patriotic people in Germany. He said that our visit and the preliminary negotiations that have already taken place have once again proved that the fraternal friendship between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union is inseparable.

Ulbricht pointed out that thanks to the Soviet Union's initiative and the unremitting struggle of all socialist countries and peace-loving forces in the world, the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has finally been convened.

Ulbricht pointed out that we thank the Soviet Union for its persistent efforts to ensure that the two German governments participate in the Geneva Conference on an equal footing. The participation of the two Germanys in the conference this time is of fundamental significance, because in this way, the major powers have de facto recognized the two Germanys, and have taken the first step in preparing for negotiations between the two Germanys.

Ulbricht emphasized that major progress in preparing for the reunification of Germany can only be expected when the Geneva Six Foreign Ministers Conference or the highest-level meeting reaches an agreement on issues such as renouncing the use of force, refusing to set up atomic and rocket weapons in Germany, limiting armed forces, and concluding a peace treaty. Ulbricht continued that a unified Germany can only be a peace-loving and democratic country, therefore, concluding a peace treaty signed by the two Germanys is the peaceful foundation for restoring German unity.

Ulbricht expressed his belief that all peace-loving forces in the German Democratic Republic and West Germany can completely transform that Germany, which has become a dangerous factor of war in Europe, into a factor of peace and security, and this can only be done if the revanchist politicians in West Germany do not receive the support of the Western powers.

    赫鲁晓夫在欢迎德党政代表团宴会上说
    苏德决心并肩建设协力争取和平
    乌布利希指出同两个德国缔结和约是德国统一的和平基础
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议8日在大克里姆林宫设宴招待以乌布利希、格罗提渥为首的德意志民主共和国党政代表团的全体成员。
    苏联方面出席宴会的有阿里斯托夫、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、库西宁、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、赫鲁晓夫、波斯别洛夫、别尔乌辛和波利扬斯基。
    在宴会上，赫鲁晓夫和乌布利希讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中说，德意志民主共和国代表团的访问将有助于进一步巩固苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的合作。他指出，十年来，苏联和德意志民主共和国在和平建设和争取和平的斗争中，一直并肩携手前进。赫鲁晓夫说：“我们可以骄傲地说：我们的友谊经受过了时间的考验。这种友谊，对我们两国人民获得成就、对我们两国克服发展道路上的困难起了很大的作用。”
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，最近几年来，苏联和德意志民主共和国之间逐渐发展了新的更高级的合作形式——生产协作、同类型企业和科学机关之间的直接联系、共同解决一系列的科学和生产任务等。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，社会主义阵营各国的团结一致是我们最伟大的成就，我们应该像保护眼珠一样地保护它。他指出，我们的敌人非常明白这一点，所以，他们的主要企图是分裂社会主义阵营的队伍。在这种情况下，团结社会主义阵营各国的一切民主力量，是具有特别重大的意义的。使我们非常高兴的是，在德意志民主共和国，民主德国全国阵线顺利地实现着这一任务，在这个统一阵线中，在德国统一社会党的领导下，共和国一切民主党派合作无间。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希讲话说，德意志民主共和国党政代表团访问苏联，是德国全体爱好和平和爱国人民的一件重大事件。他说，我们的访问和已经举行过的初步谈判，又一次的证明了德意志民主共和国和苏联之间的兄弟般的友谊是不可分割的。
    乌布利希指出，由于苏联的倡议与所有社会主义国家和世界爱好和平力量的不懈的斗争，日内瓦外长会议终于召开了。
    乌布利希指出，我们感谢苏联顽强地争取使两个德国政府平等地参加了日内瓦会议。这次两个德国参加会议是具有原则性的意义的，因为，这样，大国就在事实上承认了两个德国，在准备两个德国之间的谈判方面迈出了第一步。
    乌布利希强调指出，只有当日内瓦六国外长会议或者是最高级会议就拒绝使用武力、拒绝在德国设置原子和火箭武器、限制武装力量和缔结和约等问题达成协议时，才能指望在准备恢复德国统一方面有重大进展。乌布利希接着指出，统一后的德国只能是一个爱好和平和民主的国家，因此，缔结由两个德国签字的和约，是恢复德国统一的和平基础。
    乌布利希表示相信，德意志民主共和国和西德一切爱好和平的力量，完全可以把成为欧洲战争危险因素的那个德国变成为和平和安全的因素，而这一点只有在西德复仇主义政客得不到西方大国的支持的情况下才能办到。（附图片）
