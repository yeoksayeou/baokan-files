Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory Implements Group Economic Accounting System
    Running the Enterprise Diligently and Frugally

    (Our report) While establishing and improving enterprise management systems, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory has been focusing on group economic accounting, extensively involving workers in the enterprise's economic activity analysis, and effectively promoting the development of the increased production and thrift campaign. This has led to a new atmosphere throughout the factory where everything is carefully calculated and everyone pays attention to economic results. In April, the factory's output more than doubled compared to the same period last year. Product quality, calculated based on the rejection rate of four types of mass-produced main products, decreased by 1.1% to 7.9% compared to March. Production costs decreased by about 15.05% compared to the same period last year, saving a total of 400,700 yuan. Since the beginning of May, the group economic accounting system has been further consolidated and improved.

    In the first quarter, many groups of workers in this factory focused on increasing output, but did not pay enough attention to comprehensive economic results such as improving quality and reducing costs. As a result, the utilization rate of raw materials was low, the consumption of tools and fixtures often exceeded quotas, and the rejection rate also increased. Workers in the Gauge Workshop, for example, focused solely on output, and once broke more than one hundred high-speed steel cutters in one hour, directly affecting production. In order to establish the idea of comprehensively emphasizing economic results among the workers, in March, in addition to continuing to educate workers on "more, faster, better, and more economical," and establishing new rules and regulations, the factory party committee focused on implementing the economic accounting system in all groups throughout the factory. It organized group workers to develop specific indicators and quotas for daily economic activities, and assessed the results at any time. Due to leadership taking the lead, office personnel going down to help, and workers actively participating, the factory's group economic accounting system was universally launched in mid-March. All one hundred and twenty-eight groups in the factory participated in this activity, and one hundred and fourteen groups immediately achieved significant results after implementing the economic accounting system. In the past, the crane and ventilation team of the Equipment and Power Section often requested new spare parts during maintenance. Since the implementation of group economic accounting, all team members have created four types of record cards and comparison tables to control specific consumption indicators within the team. Workers carefully calculated the consumption of each spare part, and tried every means to save spare parts and repair old and broken spare parts for use. From mid-March to the end of April, they saved more than 6,000 yuan in material costs for the country, prompting the team's costs to decrease by about 20% per month compared to the plan. The Medium-sized Machine Tool Team 2 of the Instrument Workshop, after implementing economic accounting and having tool consumption indicators in April, two-thirds of the "die" tools used throughout the month were repaired rejects.

    Now, the factory's group economic accounting system is becoming normalized and institutionalized. Workshop economists often go to the groups to understand the accounting situation and help solve specific problems in accounting. The factory's economic section holds reporting meetings for workshop economists every week to promptly convey and solve problems in group accounting.

### 哈尔滨量具刃具厂推行小组经济核算制  克勤克俭办好企业

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂推行小组经济核算制
    克勤克俭办好企业
    本报讯　哈尔滨量具刃具厂在建立与健全企业管理制度的同时，狠抓小组经济核算，广泛吸收工人参加企业经济活动分析工作，有力地促进了增产节约运动的开展，在全厂内出现了事事精打细算、人人讲究经济效果的新局面。4月份全厂产量比去年同期翻了一番半以上；产品质量按四种成批生产的主要产品的废品率计算，比3月份分别降低1.1％到7.9％；生产成本比去年同期降低了15.05％左右，共节约资金达四十万零七千元。进入5月以来，小组经济核算制进一步巩固和提高。
    这个厂的许多小组的工人在一季度注意了提高产量，而对提高质量、降低成本等全面的经济成果却注意不够。因此，生产中原料、材料利用率低，工具、卡具的消耗经常超过定额，废品率也有所上升。量规车间工人就因为单纯追求产量，一次在一个小时内打坏高速钢刀具一百多把，直接影响到生产。为了在工人中树立起全面讲究经济效果的思想，厂党委在3月份除了继续对工人进行“多快好省”的教育，并且建立新的规章制度以外，着重在全厂的小组里推行了经济核算制度，组织小组工人把日常的经济活动制订出具体指标、定额等，随时考核成效。由于领导挂帅，科室人员下去帮助，工人主动参加，这个厂的小组经济核算制在3月中旬就普遍地开展起来，全厂一百二十八个小组都投入到这个活动中来，并且已有一百一十四个小组，在执行经济核算制以后立即收到了显著的效果。设备动力科的吊车通风组过去在维修中经常请领新的备件，自从推行小组经济核算以后，全体组员创造出四种纪录卡片和比较表，来控制组内各项消耗具体指标，工人们每消耗一个备件都要经过精打细算，都千方百计节省备件和修复旧的和坏的备件用，从3月中旬到4月末就为国家节约了六千多元的材料费，促使小组成本连月都比计划降低20％左右。仪表车间中型机床二组，4月份开始实行经济核算有了工具消耗指标以后，全月耗用的“板牙”工具中三分之二都是修复的废品。
    现在，这个厂的小组经济核算制正趋向正常化、制度化。车间经济员经常到小组了解核算情况，帮助解决核算中的具体问题，厂部的经济科每周都召开车间经济员的汇报会议，及时传达和解决小组核算中的问题。
