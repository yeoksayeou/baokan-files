Xiang embroidery workers in Changsha, Xiangtan, Xiangyin, Hengyang and other places in Hunan Province are meticulously embroidering more and better products.

The veteran painters in the drawing workshop of the Hunan Provincial Light Industry Department's Arts and Crafts Experimental Factory have drawn a large horizontal screen of "Chairman Mao's Hometown - Panoramic View of Shaoshan", which is currently being embroidered by skilled embroiderers. The Xiang embroidery bedspreads produced by the Changsha Xiang Embroidery Factory for foreign customers have added new patterns with national characteristics and reflecting China's real life this year, such as "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers" and "Harvest".

Embroidery women workers have created many new embroidery methods. They also use the method of "random embroidery plus ginseng stitch" to embroider oil paintings that have never been embroidered before.

    湘绣精益求精
    湖南省长沙、湘潭、湘阴、衡阳等地的湘绣职工们，正在精心地绣刺更多更好的产品。
    湖南轻工业厅工艺美术试验厂绘制车间的老画师们，绘制了一幅“毛主席故乡——韶山全景”大幅横屏，目前正由手艺精巧的绣工们绣刺。长沙湘绣厂为国外订户生产的湘绣被面，今年增加了“天女散花”、“丰收”等富有民族风格和反映我国现实生活的新图案。
    绣刺女工创造了不少新的绣刺方法。她们还用“乱绣加参针”的方法，绣出从来没有绣过的油画。
