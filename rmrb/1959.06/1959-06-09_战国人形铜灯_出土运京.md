	"Warring States Period Human-Shaped Bronze Lamp" Unearthed and Transported to Beijing
	Recently, the Shandong Provincial Cultural Relics Management Office sent a large number of precious historical relics to the Chinese History Museum. Among them, a human-shaped bronze lamp from the Warring States period more than two thousand years ago is a very rare ancient household item.
	This bronze lamp, said to be unearthed in Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, is the oldest and most complete set of ancient bronze lamps unearthed. The lamp's structure is very ingenious, with a total height of 23.2 centimeters. It is shaped like a person standing on the back of a crouching mythical beast, with both hands raised, each holding a cylindrical object. The cylindrical holes can hold willow-branch-shaped lamp holders, and each holder has a lamp dish attached. The lamp holders and lamp dishes are all movable and can be freely disassembled and installed, with very suitable dimensions. In addition, there is a bronze oil-adding lamp spoon, 23 centimeters long.

    “战国人形铜灯”出土运京
    最近山东省文物管理处，为中国历史博物馆寄来大批珍贵历史文物，其中有一个两千多年以前战国时代的人形铜灯，是件非常罕有的古代生活用具。
    这个铜灯，据说是山东省诸城县出土的，是出土古代铜灯中最古而最完整的一套。灯形结构非常巧妙，通高二十三点二公分，作一人双足踏在一呈盘踞状的辟邪兽的背上，两手齐举，手中各握有筒状物，筒孔可以安插似柳枝形的灯托，托上又附有灯盏各一枚。灯托灯盏都是活的，可以自由拆卸安装，尺寸非常吻合适宜。另外，还有添油的铜灯勺一件，长二十三公分。
