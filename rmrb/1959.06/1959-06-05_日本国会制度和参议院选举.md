    Japanese Diet System and House of Councillors Election
    The Japanese Diet is the supreme organ of state power and the highest legislative body. It consists of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The House of Representatives has 467 members, elected by universal suffrage, with a term of four years. The House of Councillors has 250 members, of which 100 are elected by national popular vote and 150 are elected by local elections, with a term of six years, with half of the seats being re-elected every three years. Although the House of Councillors has less power than the House of Representatives in determining the new Prime Minister, motions of no confidence in the Cabinet, and discussing the budget, it is equal to the House of Representatives in restricting the government's power to amend the Constitution. Amendments to the Constitution must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the members of both the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives before a motion can be introduced prior to holding a national referendum. Unlike the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister has no power to dissolve the House of Councillors.
    In the fifth election of the House of Councillors held this time, 125 Councillors whose terms had expired were re-elected, and two vacancies were filled in supplementary elections, for a total of 127. The total number of original members and the number of re-elected members of the main parties are as follows: Liberal Democratic Party 127 members, of which 66 were re-elected; Japan Socialist Party 78 members, of which 31 were re-elected; Ryokufukai 20 members, of which 15 were re-elected; Japan Communist Party 2 members, none of whom were re-elected this time.

    日本国会制度和参议院选举
    日本的国会是最高权力和最高立法机关。它是由众议院和参议院两院组成。众议院议员四百六十七名，由普选产生，任期四年。参议院议员二百五十名，其中一百名由全国普选产生，一百五十名由地方选举产生，任期六年，每三年改选半数议席。参议院虽然在确定新的内阁首相、对内阁提不信任案和讨论预算等方面，权限不如众议院；但是它在限制政府修改宪法的权力方面和众议院是同等的。宪法的修改，在举行国民投票之前，必需由参、众两院三分之二的议员表示赞成，才能提出动议。参议院不同于众议院，首相无权加以解散。
    在这次举行的参议院第五次选举中，改选了一百二十五名任期届满的参议员，另外还补选了两个空席，共计一百二十七名。各主要党派原有议员总数和改选议员数如下：自由民主党一百二十七名，其中改选六十六名；日本社会党七十八名，其中改选三十一名；绿风会二十名，其中改选十五名；日本共产党两名，这次全不改选。
