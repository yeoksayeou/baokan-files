Guangzhou, June 14th (People's Daily) - The Liantang Brigade of the Xieji People's Commune in Gaozhou County, Guangdong Province, has adopted five measures to ensure that rice in the fields near villages and roadsides is not damaged by poultry and livestock.

Most of the brigade's more than 3,000 mu of early rice is already ripe and golden, with long ears of grain hanging low. However, recently, the sideline occupations of many production teams and commune members' families have developed rapidly, and as a result, a lot of rice near villages and roadsides has been eaten by pigs and chickens. More than five tenths of the three mu of fields near Jinxi Production Team's village have been eaten by chickens and ducks; and two tenths of the crops grown on the team's four mu of hillside land have also been eaten by cattle.

The Party branch organized cadres and experienced farmers to conduct field inspections and calculated the costs: If the more than 800 mu of fields near villages and roadsides in the entire brigade were not damaged by poultry and livestock, and if each mu could yield an additional 20 jin of grain, it would be possible to harvest an additional 16,000 jin of grain. Everyone decided to take the following five measures to prevent losses: First, form a harvest protection group to strengthen leadership over harvest protection work; second, demarcate grazing areas for livestock; only grass can be cut on the field ridges, and grazing is not allowed; third, fully implement penning of pigs, achieving both manure accumulation and harvest protection; fourth, those who release chickens, ducks, and geese into the fields and damage production will be given criticism or punishment as appropriate; fifth, fields along the main roads should have the rice stalks pressed down and tied up to facilitate pedestrians and reduce losses. The commune members all said that these measures were good. Now, all thirty-four production teams have taken action, harvest protection groups have been established one after another, most of the more than 800 mu of roadside fields have been pressed down and tied up, and penning of pigs has also been fully implemented.

    防止家禽家畜糟踏庄稼
    谢鸡人民公社立法五章
    本报广州14日电　广东省高州县谢鸡公社莲塘大队采取五项措施，保证挨近村边、路边田里的稻谷不受禽畜糟踏。
    这个大队的三千多亩早稻，大部分已经黄熟，长长的谷穗低低下垂。可是最近不少生产队和社员的家庭副业发展很快，因此村边路边的稻谷被猪和鸡吃掉不少。锦西生产队村边的三亩田，被鸡鸭吃掉了五分多；这个队还有四亩坡地，种的作物也被牛吃去了二成。
    党支部组织干部和老农进行了田间检查，并且算了一笔账：全大队有八百多亩近村临路的田，如果不受家禽家畜糟踏，要是一亩多收二十斤谷，就可以多收一万六千斤谷。大家决定采取以下五项措施来防止损失：一、组成保收小组，加强保收工作的领导；二、划定牲畜放牧地区，田埂上只准割草，不准放牧；三、全面实行圈猪，积肥、保收一举两得；四、放鸡、鸭、鹅下田损害生产的，酌情给予批评或处罚；五、大路边上的田要压禾、扎禾，方便行人，减少损失。社员们都说这几条办法好。现在，三十四个生产队都已行动起来，保收小组已先后成立，八百多亩路边田已大部分压好、扎好，圈猪也已全面实行了。（陈心泉）
