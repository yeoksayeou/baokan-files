    Xinhua News Agency, June 11th, Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Foreign Ministry handed a note from the Soviet government to the Italian Embassy in the Soviet Union on June 10th regarding the issue of establishing foreign rocket bases on Italian territory. This note is a response to the Italian government's note to the Soviet government on May 10th regarding this issue.

    In the note, the Soviet government pointed out that, disregarding the Soviet government's well-intentioned warnings, the Italian government has once again indicated its intention to establish foreign rocket bases on its territory, and therefore, it will bear serious responsibility for all the consequences arising from this policy.

    The note emphasized that the Soviet government believes that reaching an agreement to rid the entire world of nuclear weapons and atomic weapons is one of the major tasks facing all countries. Therefore, the joint statement of the Soviet and Albanian governments on May 30th reminded the Italian government that establishing a nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-free zone in the Balkan Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea region is in the interests of the people of this region.

    The note said that the refusal of the countries of the Balkan Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea region to establish rocket and atomic bases on their territories would be a great contribution to turning this region into a zone of peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 9th: According to a report by the Bulgarian News Agency, the Bulgarian government stated in a note to the Greek government that it fully supports Khrushchev's proposal, made during his visit to Albania, to make the Balkans a peaceful peninsula free of rocket and atomic weapons, and is prepared to sign the necessary agreements with other Balkan countries for this purpose.

    The Bulgarian note is a reply to the Greek government's note of June 3rd. The reply was handed over to the Greek Minister to Bulgaria, Mr. Papadopoulos, by the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, Mr. Tarabanov, on the 9th.

    In the reply, the Bulgarian government pointed out that the issue of reaching an agreement to declare the Balkan Peninsula a nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-free zone is of paramount importance. The realization of this proposition will be in line with the most ardent wishes of the peoples of the Balkan countries. The Bulgarian government believes that the issue of concluding a non-aggression treaty between Bulgaria and Greece is worth discussing. The conclusion of such a treaty will create conditions for normal relations between the two countries and will open a period of establishing sincere good-neighborly relations, friendship, and cooperation for the two peoples.

    苏保分别照会意大利和希腊
    巴尔干地区应成为无原子区
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部在6月10日把苏联政府就在意大利领土上建立外国的火箭基地问题给意大利政府的一份照会交给意大利驻苏联大使馆。这份照会是对意大利政府5月10日就这个问题给苏联政府的照会的答复。
    苏联政府在照会中指出，意大利政府不顾苏联政府的善意的警告，再一次表明它打算在自己的领土上建立外国火箭基地，所以，它将对由于这一政策而产生的一切后果承担严重的责任。
    照会强调指出，苏联政府认为，达成使全世界摆脱核武器和原子武器的协议是摆在所有国家面前的重大任务之一。因此，5月30日在苏联和阿尔巴尼亚两国政府的联合声明中曾提醒意大利政府注意，在巴尔干半岛和亚得里亚海地区建立无原子和火箭地区是符合这一地区人民的利益的。
    照会说，巴尔干半岛和亚得里亚海地区的国家拒绝在自己领土上建立火箭和原子基地将是对把这一地区变为和平地区的一个巨大的贡献。
    新华社索非亚9日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道，保加利亚政府在给希腊政府的一项照会中表示，它完全支持赫鲁晓夫在访问阿尔巴尼亚期间所提出的关于使巴尔干成为无火箭和原子武器的和平半岛的建议，并准备为此目的同其他巴尔干国家签订必要的协定。
    保加利亚的这项照会是对希腊政府6月3日照会的复照。复照已于9日由保加利亚外交部第一副部长塔拉巴诺夫交给了希腊驻保加利亚公使帕巴多普洛斯。
    保加利亚政府在复照中指出，具有头等重要意义的问题是，达成宣布巴尔干半岛为无火箭和原子武器地区的协议。实现这一主张，将符合巴尔干各国人民最热切的愿望。保加利亚政府认为，关于保加利亚和希腊之间缔结互不侵犯条约的问题是值得讨论的。缔结这种条约，将为两国之间的正常关系创造条件，并将为两国人民打开一个建立真诚的睦邻关系、友谊和合作的时期。
