Xinhua News Agency, June 16th. Eduardo Vallejos, Second Vice President of the Peruvian Chamber of Deputies, who is currently visiting China, told Xinhua reporters in Beijing today that China is living in a new era, and the work of the Chinese people for their own happiness is also work to safeguard world peace.

Most members of the Peruvian delegation are currently visiting southern China. Today, reporters in Beijing interviewed four members of the Peruvian delegation who are about to return home first: Eduardo Vallejos, Jorge Aviva Lo, Carlos Garcia, and Cesar Ortega Flores. These Peruvian friends from across the Pacific said in their conversation that they were deeply impressed by the tremendous achievements of the Chinese people's hard construction work they saw in China, and they also expressed their best wishes to the Chinese people.

Eduardo Vallejos said, "I am not a socialist or a communist in politics, but I must admit the efforts of the Chinese people in all aspects that I have seen in China. Everyone I met in China, whether leaders or ordinary workers, are working steadfastly. China's past and present are incomparable. I know that China's history has often been plagued by 'internal and external troubles.' Today, I see construction everywhere here." When talking about safeguarding world peace, he said that peace is the most fundamental welfare issue for the people of the world. The people of the world are friends, and the Peruvian people feel very close to the Chinese people.

Jorge Aviva Lo, First Secretary of the Peruvian Chamber of Deputies, said that China is working hard to change its backward situation, and the socialist system is very good for China.

Dr. Cesar Ortega Flores, a cancer specialist, said that although his time in China was short, the impression was deep; what he saw in China has exceeded his original expectations. He especially mentioned that after visiting some medical institutions in Beijing and Shanghai, he felt that China has a very high level in medicine. When talking about developing the friendship between Peru and China, he said that the first thing to do is to strengthen cultural and artistic ties. In the conversation, he expressed his great pleasure for the mutual exchange of books between the Peruvian Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences through him.

Carlos Garcia, an agriculturalist, said, "I am very surprised to see the progress made by the Chinese people in more than nine years. I visited the People's Commune and was deeply impressed. The People's Commune will take China to a more advanced place." He also said that the Chinese people's love for art and the Chinese youth's dedication to learning and sports gave him a deep impression.

    秘鲁议员团的大部分成员目前正在我国南方访问，今天记者在北京访问了即将先期返国的秘鲁议员团中的四位议员：爱德华多·巴列霍斯、豪尔赫·阿维瓦洛、卡洛斯·加西亚和塞萨·奥尔特加·弗洛雷斯。这些来自太平洋彼岸的秘鲁朋友们在谈话中说，他们在中国看到的中国人民辛勤的建设工作所取得的巨大成就，给他们留下了深刻的印象，他们还向中国人民表达了良好的祝愿。
    爱德华多·巴列霍斯说，我在政治上不是一个社会主义者和共产主义者，但是我要承认，我在中国看到的中国人民在一切方面的努力。我在中国遇到的一切人，不论是领导人或是普通工人，他们都在坚定地工作着。中国的过去和现在是不能相比拟的，我知道中国历史上经常是“内忧外患”，今天我看到这里到处都在建设。他在谈到维护世界和平的问题时说，和平是关系到全世界人民最根本的福利问题。世界上的人民都是朋友，秘鲁人民对中国人民很感亲切。
    秘鲁众议院第一秘书豪尔赫·阿维瓦洛说，中国正在努力改变着它的落后状况，社会主义制度对中国说来是很好的。
    癌病专家塞萨·奥尔特加·弗洛雷斯博士说，虽然在中国的时间很短，但印象很深；在中国所看到的已经超出了原来的设想。他特别提到他在北京和上海参观一些医疗机构以后，感到中国在医学上有很高的水平。在谈到发展秘鲁和中国两国的友谊时，他说，首先是应该加强文化、艺术上的联系。他在谈话中，对于秘鲁科学院和中国科学院这次通过他互赠书籍表示十分高兴。
    农业家卡洛斯·加西亚说，我看到中国人民在九年多的时间内所取得的进步，非常惊奇。我参观了人民公社，得到了很深的印象，人民公社将把中国带到更前进的地方去。他还表示，中国人民对于艺术的热爱和中国青年专心于学习和体育运动等，给予他很深的印象。
