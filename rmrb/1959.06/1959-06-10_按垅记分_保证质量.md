    Measure Work by Furrow, Guarantee Quality

    The Shitou Management Area of the Lihe Commune and the Dalong Management Area of the Dalong Commune in Yushu County, Jilin Province, are both implementing a method of contracting work by plot and calculating scores by furrow during summer hoeing, which assigns responsibility for hoeing quality to individuals and greatly improves labor efficiency.

    When hoeing began this year in these two management areas, production teams worked together in the fields. Sometimes those who arrived first had to wait for those who arrived later; those who hoed quickly had to wait for those who hoed slowly, resulting in wasted labor. Those who arrived late and hoed slowly were afraid of falling behind, so they rushed their work regardless of quality. When the team inspected, it was impossible to determine who hoed which furrow, making it impossible to trace responsibility for quality. Later, both management areas implemented the method of contracting work by plot and calculating scores by furrow. This method involves the production team determining different work points based on the distance and size of different plots, and then dividing the plots among several contracting groups (each group of about ten people) based on the physical strength and technical skill of the members. The contracting groups calculate the work points for each furrow, so that members know how many points they will receive for hoeing a certain number of furrows. When contracting the work, quality standards are also set, and inspection is done by furrow. If the quality is not up to standard, the work must be redone. Since implementing this method, labor efficiency and labor quality have greatly improved in both management areas. The two communes where these management areas are located are now preparing to promote this method in other farm work such as thinning seedlings between rows. (Cheng Yu)

    按垅记分　保证质量
    吉林榆树县李合公社石塘管理区和大岭公社大龙管理区，都在夏锄中实行按地块包工、以垅记分的办法，把铲地质量落实到人，大大提高了劳动效率。
    这两个管理区在今年开始铲地时，都是以生产队为单位一齐下地。有时先来的要等着后来的；铲地快的要等着铲地慢的；因而发生窝工现象。晚来的和铲地慢的又怕自己落在后面，就不顾质量赶进度。队里验收时，也不知谁铲的那条垅，无法追查质量责任。后来，两个管理区都推行了按地块包工，以垅记分的办法。这个办法是先由生产队按地块远近、大小等不同情况，确定不同工分，并根据社员体力强弱，技术高低等具体条件，划分几个包工小组（每组十人左右），承包这些地块。包工小组算出每一垅的包工分数，使社员知道铲几垅就是几分。在包工时，还确定了质量标准，按垅验收，质量不够即重新返工。两个管理区实行这个办法以后，劳动效率和劳动质量都大大提高。现在，这两个管理区所在的两个公社，都准备在趟地间苗等其他农活中推行这个办法。（程予）
