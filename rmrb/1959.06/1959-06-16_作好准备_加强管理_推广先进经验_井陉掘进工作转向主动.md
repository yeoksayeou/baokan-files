    Report from the Hebei Daily: The Jingxing Mining Bureau has adjusted its forces, strengthened leadership in tunneling work, and exceeded its monthly footage plan in May. Currently, the amount of coal obtained by the entire bureau has increased from 3.1 months in early April to 4 months, initially reversing the passive situation in tunneling. The tunneling workers of the entire bureau are continuing their efforts to ensure that the amount of coal obtained by the entire bureau reaches the national standard as soon as possible.
    From January to April of this year, the Jingxing Mining Bureau failed to complete its tunneling plan every month, and the amount of coal obtained decreased month by month. Because the tunneling plan was not completed, the coal mining face was in a very tense state. The 106 working face of the Third Mine, due to the interruption of mining and tunneling connection, resulted in random mining in the newly excavated transportation roadway.
    In order to reverse this passive situation, strengthen tunneling work, ensure the connection of mining and tunneling, and organize normal production, the bureau leadership has taken concrete measures. The first is to strengthen the leadership of tunneling work. From the bureau to the mine, a Party committee secretary, mine manager, and engineer are designated to form a tunneling leadership front to specifically lead tunneling and development work. Each mine has adjusted its forces according to the specific situation, increased the number of tunneling teams, and adjusted and supplemented the personnel of the tunneling teams, fixing the tunneling and personnel, and overcoming the past practice of arbitrarily transferring tunneling teams to engage in retreat mining.
    Strengthening tunneling management and technical management work, and adopting the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians to do a good job in tunneling roadway design, eliminate ineffective footage, and increase the amount of coal obtained, is the second measure to strengthen tunneling work. The Fourth Mine adopted the method of combining the three to establish a regular meeting system once a week, with technicians from the district and team participating, to study and affirm the development design plan, strengthen the close connection between functional departments and the district, and the team and workers are very clear about the geological conditions and tunneling direction. In rock tunneling, the cooperation of three shifts was strengthened, the quality of the project was improved, and the tunneling speed was accelerated. The entire mine completed the May tunneling plan six days and two shifts ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan, and the amount of coal obtained increased from 89,566 tons at the end of April to 92,966 tons. The "August 1st" team of the Second Mine strengthened plan management, achieved planning before the shift and inspection after the shift, and adopted the "five grasps" (grasping the hole plan, grasping the preparation work, grasping drilling and blasting, grasping coal loading and transportation, grasping labor allocation) and "five fasts" (fast entering the mine, fast handover of shifts, fast blasting and eating dry food, fast coal loading, fast support) method. In May, the monthly progress was 434.8 meters, exceeding the operation plan by 14.8 meters, and 131.8 meters more than in April.
    The third measure is to carry out red flag competition and vigorously promote advanced tunneling experience. The First Mine promoted four-shift cross-operation and deep-hole operation of double-slotting and one-time side opening, creating a new record of 35.7 meters of daily progress in the five-layer coal seam on May 30, reaching 500.1 meters of double-hole tunneling for the whole month, which was 23 meters more than in April. The 208 tunneling team of the Third Mine, due to the implementation of advanced experience such as three-type relay slotting, deep-hole blasting, single-person drilling, and double electric drill operation, created a new tunneling record of 446 meters per month.

    作好准备　加强管理　推广先进经验
    井陉掘进工作转向主动
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：井陉矿务局调整力量，加强掘进工作的领导，5月份超额完成了月进尺计划，现在，全局获得煤量已由4月初的三点一个月，达到四个月，初步扭转了掘进被动局面。全局掘进职工正继续努力，争取全局获得煤量尽快达到国家规定标准。
    井陉矿务局今年1月至4月份，月月完不成掘进计划，获得煤量逐月下降。因为掘进计划完不成，给采煤工作面带来非常紧张的状态，三矿一零六工作面由于采掘衔接中断，到刚掘出的运输巷乱采洞。
    为扭转这一被动局面，加强掘进工作，保证采掘衔接，组织正常生产，局领导上采取了具体措施。首先是加强对掘进工作的领导，从局到矿都确定一名党委书记、矿长和工程师组成掘进领导战线，专门领导掘进开拓工作。各矿根据具体情况，调整了力量，增加了掘进小组，并且调整和补充了掘进组人员，把掘进和人员固定下来，克服了过去任意调动掘进组搞回采的作法。
    加强掘进管理和技术管理工作，采取领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合的方法，作好掘进巷道设计，消灭无效进尺，增加获得煤量，这是加强掘进工作的第二个措施。四矿采取三结合的方法，建立每周一次的定期会议制度，有区、组的技术员参加，研究与肯定开拓设计规划，加强了职能科室与区之间的密切联系，小组、工人对地质情况、掘进方向都很清楚。在岩石掘进中加强了三班协作，提高了工程质量，加快了掘进速度。全矿在5月份提前六天零二个班超额完成了5月份掘进计划，获得煤量由4月底的八万九千五百六十六吨增加到九万二千九百六十六吨。二矿“八一”队加强了计划管理，作到了班前有计划，班后有检查，并采取了“五抓”（抓洞计划、抓做好准备工作、抓打眼放炮、抓装煤运输、抓劳动调配），“五快”（下井快、交接班快、放炮吃干粮快、装煤快、支架快）方法，5月份月进四百三十四点八公尺，超过作业计划十四点八公尺，比4月多掘进一百三十一点八公尺。
    第三个措施是开展红旗对手赛，大力推广掘进先进经验。一矿推广了四班交叉作业，和双次掏槽一次开帮的深孔作业，在5月30日创造了五层煤日进三十五点七公尺的新纪录，全月达到双孔掘进五百点一公尺，比4月份多掘进了二十三公尺。三矿二零八掘进队由于推行了三型接力掏槽，深孔爆破，单人打眼，双台电钻操作等先进经验，创月进四百四十六公尺的掘进新纪录。
