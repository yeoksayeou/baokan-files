Joyfully Watching Red Clouds Descend to the World
—An Introduction to the Dance Drama "Five Red Clouds"

At the Second All-Army Literary and Art Performance, the large-scale dance drama "Five Red Clouds" performed by the Song and Dance Troupe of the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, received enthusiastic praise from the audience.

"Five Red Clouds" is a large-scale dance drama in four acts and seven scenes, adapted from the struggle stories and folk legends of the Li people of Hainan Island. It immediately brings the audience into an exciting realm. The morning mist is dissipating, and white clouds surround the peaks of the Five Finger Mountain. Gong Hu, a Li youth captured by the Kuomintang, returns with a red five-star towel after being rescued by the Communist Party. The brutal Kuomintang bandit army then captures A Wen and Ke Ying, locking them in iron cages for public display, calling them "?". Ke Ying's child is thrown into the fire by the bandits and burned alive. A group of Li girls are forced to pound rice for the enemy under the point of bayonets...

The Li people are in suffering. Suddenly, from the faint sunset glow, five red auspicious clouds gradually appear, the golden light illuminating the entire Five Finger Mountain. Legend has it that five red clouds often appear in the sky above Five Finger Mountain at dusk. If the red clouds descend to the ground, the Li people will be able to escape their suffering and find happiness. Under the red light, a song filled with the Li people's yearning for a better life resounds in the valley:

	The Five Finger Mountain peaks are high,
	Five red clouds shine in the sky;
	If the red clouds fall,
	Suffering will dissipate and happiness will arrive.
	O auspicious colorful clouds,
	When will you descend,
	And illuminate the suffering Li family.

Then, the Li people, unable to endure the brutal rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, launched an armed uprising in the Five Finger Mountain. However, in the beginning, due to the lack of leadership from the Communist Party, the absence of far-reaching political goals, and strict organizational discipline, the uprising failed under the enemy's bloody suppression. After several setbacks, they decided to send someone to find their savior, the Communist Party. Just at the critical moment, the Qiongya Column led by the Communist Party arrived, rescuing them from the abyss of suffering. At this time, five brilliant red clouds slowly descended from the sky, "Blood and Tears Ridge" became "Red Cloud Ridge," and songs rose from the colored clouds:

	The red flag is planted on the top of the Five Finger Mountain,
	Five red clouds have fallen from the sky.
	The golden rooster in the fire flies to heaven,
	The Li people are reborn from death.
	Drums beat on the mountain in all directions,
	Bamboo flutes and sheng play together.
	The Communist Party is our re-born parent,
	The Communist Party is the savior of the nation.
	Thousands of roads lie before the Five Finger Mountain,
	We are determined to follow the Party and advance.

The dance drama, using revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, depicts the epic of the Hainan Island Li people's struggle from 1943 to 1944. Most of the dances in the play adopt the folk dance materials of the Li people, such as the ghost dance, the firewood dance, and the money bell double knife dance, combined with some Chinese classical dance, Miao dance and foreign ballet dance techniques. The music of the dance drama also absorbs the essence of Li folk music such as "Five Streams on Five Finger Mountain" and "Lo Nei Tune." The whole drama has a strong national flavor. During the dance drama, there are also several accompanying songs in each act, the lyrics, music, and dance are closely integrated, carrying forward the characteristics of singing and dancing in Chinese classical opera, which is very helpful for highlighting the ideological feelings of the dance drama and strengthening the dramatic effect.

The emergence of the "Five Red Clouds" dance drama is the result of the Guangzhou Military Region Song and Dance Troupe's long-term in-depth practice, in-depth "folk collection" and careful creation. As early as when Hainan Island was just liberated, this song and dance troupe collected the folk story of "Five Red Clouds" while performing on Hainan Island. In the past few years, they have gone to the Five Finger Mountain area three or four times to contact the Li people and experience life. After the "Five Red Clouds" creation team was officially established in October last year, the choreographers, composers, actors and art designers immediately went to the scene of the event for interviews and study. They visited the leaders who led the armed uprising that year and a branch captain of the Qiongya Column, organized several old soldiers who participated in the uprising to hold discussions, and widely read some materials about Li customs and social life. Some people also went to the Li Hongqi People's Commune to work for half a month to a month, eating, living and working with the Li people, enriching their creative life. After the dance drama was completed, they solicited opinions from various aspects, rehearsed and revised, revised and rehearsed, and the literary script alone was revised more than a dozen times before it gradually became complete.

    喜看红云降人间
    ——舞剧“五朵红云”介绍
    新华社记者　徐学增
    在全军第二届文艺会演大会上，人民解放军广州部队歌舞团演出的大型舞剧“五朵红云”，受到了观众的热烈赞扬。
    “五朵红云”是根据海南岛黎族人民的斗争故事和民间传说编成的四幕七场大型舞剧。它一开始就把观众带进了一个激动人心的境界。朝雾正在消散，白云环绕着五指山峰。被国民党捉走的黎族青年公虎被共产党救出之后带着一条红五星毛巾归来了，残暴的国民党匪军接着又抓去了阿文和柯英，关进铁笼里展览，称他（她）们是“?”。柯英的孩子被匪军丢进火中活活烧死。一群黎族少女在刺刀下逼着给敌人舂米……。
    黎族人民处在苦难中。忽然，从淡淡的晚霞里，渐渐出现了五朵红色的祥云，金光照红了整个五指山。传说每当黄昏时分，五指山上空常出现五朵红云，如果红云降下地面，黎族人民就能摆脱苦难的命运，得到幸福。在红光的照耀下，山谷中响起了凝结着黎族人民对美好生活向往的歌声：
    五指山峰高又高，
    五朵红云天上照；
    假若红云落下来，
    苦难消散幸福到。
    吉祥的彩云呀，
    你哪天才能落下来，
    把苦难的黎家来照耀。
    接着，黎族人民因不堪国民党反动派的残暴统治，在五指山里进行了武装暴动。但是开始由于没有共产党的领导，没有远大的政治目标和严密的组织纪律，在敌人的血腥镇压下，暴动失败了。经过几次挫折，他们决定派人去找自己的救星共产党。正当危急关头，共产党领导下的琼崖纵队赶来了，从水深火热中解救了他们。这时，五朵灿烂鲜红的彩云，从天上徐徐降下，“血泪岭”变成了“红云岭”，彩霞中歌声四起：
    红旗插上五指山顶，
    天空落下了五朵红云。
    火中的金鸡飞上天，
    黎族死里得重生。
    山头擂鼓八面响，
    竹笛笙箫一齐鸣。
    共产党是再生父母，
    共产党是民族救星。
    五指山前千条路，
    一心跟党奔前程。
    舞剧以革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义的手法，描绘了海南岛黎族人民从1943年到1944年的斗争史诗。剧中的舞蹈大部分采用了跳鬼、打柴舞、钱铃双刀舞等黎族民间舞的素材，结合运用了一些中国古典舞、苗族舞和外国芭蕾舞的舞汇创作出来的。舞剧的音乐也吸取了“五指山上五条溪”、“罗呢调”等黎族民间音乐的精华。全剧民族风味较浓。舞剧进行中，每一幕还有几段配歌伴唱，词、曲、舞结合的很紧，发扬了我国古典戏曲中载歌载舞的特色，对突出舞剧的思想感情，加强戏剧效果很有帮助。
    “五朵红云”舞剧的出现，是广州部队歌舞团长期深入实际、深入民间“采风”和精心创作的结果。早在海南岛刚刚解放时，这个歌舞团就在海南岛演出时搜集了“五朵红云”的民间故事。几年来，他们又先后三四次去五指山区接触黎族人民，体验生活。去年10月间正式成立了“五朵红云”创作小组后，编导、作曲、演员和美术设计等人员，又立即深入到事件现场进行访问和学习。他们拜访了当年领导武装暴动的首领和琼崖纵队的一个支队长，组织参加暴动的几位老战士进行了座谈，并广泛地阅览了一些有关黎族风俗习惯和社会生活的资料。一部分人员还到黎族红旗人民公社劳动了半个月到一个月，和黎族人民同吃同住同劳动，丰富了他们的创作生活。舞剧编成后，他们又多方面征求意见，演演改改，改改演演，光文学台本先后就改动了十几次，才使它逐步完整起来。（附图片）
