"Timely Rain"
Lu Zhongxiang

Rain can be timely or untimely. Timely rain is best, as it nourishes the fields and strengthens the seedlings. A leader's foresight has a similar stimulating effect on work as timely rain does on seedlings. When a work focus shifts from one center to another, it's particularly necessary for leaders to be like timely rain, leading the way. The People's Daily published a newsletter on May 16th, "County Party Secretary in the Fields," which is an example:

The early rice in Luchuan County, Guangxi, had mostly been transplanted, with the earliest plantings being twenty days old. However, only a small portion of the fields had been weeded and fertilized, and 70% to 80% of the labor force was still rushing to finish the transplanting. It seemed that field management had not yet been given enough importance. At this time, Wang Ying, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, came to the fields and asked everyone a question: "Now is the time when transplanting and field management are intertwined. Should we still focus on transplanting?" The director of the Third Work Zone said, "Transplanting must seize the season, and we can't shift the focus to field management." The branch secretary also believed that it would be easier to do the work if they shifted after transplanting was completed. However, some people opposed this view, arguing that field management should be the focus now. It seemed that opinions couldn't be unified quickly. Wang Ying said to the branch secretary, "Let's talk to everyone again and see if field management also needs to seize the season." Later, after field consultations, specific analysis of the seedlings, and recalling the conversations of old farmers, they guided everyone in a debate. Finally, the masses realized that if they continued to let the tail drag the center, increased production would be problematic. This quickly led to a clear contrast: Previously, the idea that "early rice is not satisfactory in the first ten days, it will naturally turn green in ten days or so" was at play, emphasizing transplanting and neglecting management. Later, it was "every plot had soldiers, every field had generals, and field management work was carried out in an organized manner."

Isn't the County Party Secretary's guidance like a "timely rain" on these fields? The County Party Secretary has great foresight and is good at making quick decisions. The value of "timely rain" lies in the word "timely." It is very important for a leader's foresight to be like "timely rain," constantly considering how to carry out the next step of work, and starting to organize the next upsurge after a production upsurge, "not letting the tail drag the center." The example of Luchuan County Party Committee is very instructive for all communes and enterprises.

### “及时雨”

    “及时雨”
    陆忠祥
    雨有及时雨、不及时雨。润庄田，壮禾苗，及时雨最好。领导者的预见就像及时雨对禾苗一样地对工作起促进作用。一个工作中心转向另一个中心，特别需要领导者像及时雨一样，走在前头。5月16日人民日报登载一篇“县委书记在田间”的通讯，便是一例：
    广西陆川县的早稻已大部插下，早插的已有二十天，而耘田追肥的仅是很少一部分田，70％至80％的劳动力仍还在突击插秧扫尾。看来，田间管理还没有被人重视起来。这时，县委第一书记王英来到田间，向大家提出一个问题：“当前正是插秧扫尾与田间管理两项工作交叉进行的时候，是不是仍然以插秧为中心呢？”第三作业区主任说：“插秧要抢季节，不能把中心转到田间管理上去。”支部书记也认为插完再转，工作好做些。可是也有人反对这种意见，他们主张目前应该以田间管理为中心。看来，意见一下子统一不起来。王英对支部书记说：“再找大家谈谈吧，看田间管理要不要抢季节。”后来，经过田头会诊，具体分析禾苗，回忆老农的谈话，引导大家辩论，终于使群众认识到再让尾巴拖住中心，增产就成问题了。由此很快出现了一个鲜明的对比：先前是“早禾不满十嘛，到十来天自然会转青的”重插轻管的思想在作怪；后来是“块块有兵，垌垌有将，田间管理工作进行得有条有理了。”
    县委书记的指导，不正是像对这些庄田下了一场“及时雨”吗？县委书记很有预见，很会多谋善断。“及时雨”所以可贵，就在于“及时”二字。一个领导者的预见像“及时雨”一样，脑子里经常考虑下一步工作如何进行，在一个生产高潮之后就着手组织下一个高潮，“不让尾巴拖住中心”，十分重要。陆川县委这个事例，对所有公社、企业都很有教益。
