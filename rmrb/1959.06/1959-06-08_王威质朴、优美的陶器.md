    Simple and Elegant Pottery
    Liang Rensheng

    In the northern countryside, we often see black-glazed and white-ground black-patterned, boldly brushed ceramic utensils displayed on natural wood-colored furniture. In the south, we can also see green-glazed, red-glazed, and relatively delicate white-ground blue-and-white ceramics placed around light and delicate bamboo furniture. This type of pottery is a very important component of folk art and craft creations. Folk pottery is widely used in rural areas of China, but some people often regard these ceramics as "rough goods." In fact, the excellent traditions of Chinese folk pottery art can be seen in these ordinary, so-called rough ceramics.

    In the folk tradition, traditional pottery-making techniques have many advantages, such as using local materials, skillfully crafting rough materials, combining practical needs with aesthetic appreciation, and so on. Skillful folk artists use their hands and a few simple tools to create all kinds of simple and elegant pottery. For example, in order to prevent wine from spilling, wine pots have a trumpet-shaped spout. The shoulders of the pot have double ears or four loops, which are convenient for people to carry and also serve as handles when pouring wine. The ears, loops, spout, and handle form a balanced, harmonious, and varied style with the vessel itself.

    Pickle jars are also commonly used utensils in life. The shape of the jar demonstrates the scientific nature of practicality and showcases the wisdom of the pottery artisans. The groove at the top of the pickle jar is for storing water. After the lid is closed, no air can enter, which prevents the vegetables inside from rotting. After storage and fermentation, a fragrant, sour, and crisp pickle can be made. Pottery artisans often make interesting decorations on the outside of the jars. This involves applying a layer of white slip to the outside of the jar body while it is still wet, and then using fingers and bamboo knives to smear and carve patterns. This method is convenient and has a very unique decorative effect.

    People in the northern mountainous areas like to use fish-pattern pillows with openwork carving, which are also a practical and beautiful type of pottery. The blue and black-brown fish patterns painted on the pillow using materials containing cobalt oxide and iron oxide are very vivid. In addition, there are also daily household items such as plates, rice bowls, water jugs, as well as clay toys such as "whistle people" and "horse riders" made for children, all of which have the above characteristics.

    Pottery is produced in a wide range of areas, almost all over the country. It has great practicality and also reflects the living habits of people in various regions and the simplicity of the working people. The patterns on folk pottery are fresh, and the tones are bright and cheerful. The organization of the decorative patterns each has its traditional style, but they do not rigidly adhere to old conventions. Every flower and every grass strives for creative beauty, rather than identical natural depictions.

    We should cherish these folk art and craft works. Through collection and research, let us draw nourishment, gain inspiration, and enrich our ceramic art works from these arts that come from life. (Attached pictures)

    质朴、优美的陶器
    梁任生
    在北方农村，常常看到木本色家具上，陈放着些黑色釉和白地黑花的笔触豪放的陶瓷器皿。在南方，我们也可以见到绿釉、红釉和一种比较纤细的白地青花陶瓷器，置放在轻巧的竹制家具左右。这种陶器是民间美术工艺创作中很重要的一个组成部分。民间陶器在我国农村中使用极广，但是有些人常把这些陶器看作“粗货”，其实就在这些所谓粗货的普通的陶器上，可以看到我国民间制陶艺术的优秀传统。
    在民间，传统的制陶技艺有着很多优点，如就地取材，粗料巧做，既结合使用的需要，又注意美的欣赏等。心灵手巧的民间艺人，就是用双手和几件简单的工具制造出各种各样质朴、优美的陶器的。例如为了注酒不洒失，酒壶有着一个喇叭花形的壶口。壶肩部有双耳或四系，让人们携带时方便，也是斟酒时的把手。耳、系、口、柄与器皿本身构成均衡、和谐、多变化的样式。
    泡菜坛也是生活中常用的器皿。坛的造型说明了实用中的科学性，表现了制陶艺人的智慧。泡菜坛顶部的凹槽是贮水用的，加盖以后，即不再进入空气，能使坛内菜蔬不致腐烂，经贮藏发酵后，便能制出一种有清香酸脆的可口泡菜了。陶器艺人常在坛子外部作有趣的装饰。那是在坛子外部坯体上的一层白色泥浆尚未干透时，即用手指和竹刀涂抹和刻划成花纹。这种方法既方便，而且具有很别致的装饰效果。
    北方山区人民喜用镂空雕花的鱼纹枕，也是一种实用而又美观的陶器。枕头上用含氧化金属钴和含氧化金属铁的材料，绘成的蓝色和黑褐色的鱼纹，非常生动。此外，还有日常家用的盘子、饭碗、水罐以及给孩子们做的“哨子人”、“骑马人”等陶质玩具等等，都具有上述的特点。
    陶器的产地很广，几乎全国各地都有，它本身具有很大的实用性，同时也反映了各地区人民的生活习惯和劳动人民的朴质。民间陶器的花纹新鲜，调子明朗、愉快；纹饰的组织，各有其传统的样式，但并不墨守陈规、拘于老套。一花一草尽力求得有创造的美，而不是一模一样的自然描画。
    我们应该珍视这些民间工艺美术作品。通过搜集、研究，让我们从这些来自生活的艺术中，汲取营养，获得启发，丰富我们的陶瓷美术作品。（附图片）
