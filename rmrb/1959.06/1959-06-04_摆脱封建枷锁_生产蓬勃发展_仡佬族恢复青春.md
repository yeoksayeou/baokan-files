　　Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, June 3rd. The Gelao ethnic group, nearly wiped out in old China, has been rejuvenated and is flourishing in the unified and fraternal family of nationalities of the motherland after nearly a decade of liberation.
　　The Gelao ethnic group is one of the oldest ethnic groups in the southwestern region of the motherland. Currently, there are more than 23,900 people scattered in more than 20 counties and cities in western Guizhou, such as Zhijin and Qianxi, and Longlin County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
　　Under feudal exploitation and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the production of the Gelao people, who lived in remote mountains, stagnated for a long time at the backward level of "planting a slope and harvesting a pot." The average yield of the staple food, corn, was only a little over 100 jin per mu. People could hardly maintain a life of half a year on bran and vegetables. Most Gelao farmers lived in thatched huts, wore clothes woven from weeds and bark, and could only cover themselves with seedling quilts and palm mats in winter. In Zhengping Township, Zunyi City, where the Gelao people were concentrated, more than 60% of the farmers wore palm clothing before liberation. At that time, no one in the Gelao ethnic group was literate. They were forbidden by the Kuomintang reactionaries to speak their own language, and even not allowed to admit that they were Gelao.
　　In the winter of 1949, with the liberation of the southwestern region of the motherland, this ancient ethnic group, which had been ravaged to the brink of extinction, was reborn and enjoyed the right to be masters of its own affairs. Although the Gelao ethnic group is small in number and lives scattered, in 1956, two Gelao autonomous townships were established in Zhengping Township, Zunyi City, and Anliang Township, Renhuai County. The Gelao people scattered in various places also participated in the local people's congresses and government work at all levels.
　　With the strong support of the state and the help of the Han people, production in the Gelao areas has flourished. In agriculture, people have accumulated fertilizer, built water conservancy projects, and cultivated the land intensively. Grain yields have continued to increase. By 1957, the situation of more than 80% of farmers lacking grain before liberation had been fundamentally changed, and it had become an area with surplus grain for external transfer. In Changshi Township, Dafang County, the average amount of grain per person was only 227 jin at the time of liberation, but it reached 540 jin in 1957. After the realization of communization in Zhengping Township, Zunyi City, in 1958, the grain yield per mu has reached the 800 jin target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. Each household also raises eight or nine pigs, changing from the "palm clothing township" of the past to a "cotton clothing township."
　　The leap in production has greatly improved the lives of the Gelao people. In this year, illiteracy was basically eliminated, and primary school education was popularized. Every Gelao village has medical and health institutions. Whether in production or in life, they are increasingly approaching the level of the local Han people.

### 摆脱封建枷锁  生产蓬勃发展  仡佬族恢复青春

    摆脱封建枷锁  生产蓬勃发展
    仡佬族恢复青春
    新华社贵阳3日电　在旧中国几乎被消灭了的仡佬族，解放近十年来，在祖国统一团结的民族大家庭里，恢复了它的青春，日益繁荣。
    仡佬族是祖国西南地区历史悠久的民族之一，目前共二万三千九百多人，散居在贵州西部的织金、黔西等二十多个县市和广西僮族自治区隆林县。
    在封建剥削和国民党反动统治下，住在边远深山的仡佬族人民，生产长期停滞在“种一坡、收一锅”的落后水平，主粮玉米的产量每亩平均不过一百多斤，人们连糠菜半年粮的生活都难以维持。大多数仡佬族农民住草棚，用野草、树皮编成衣服穿，冬天只能盖秧被、棕毡。仡佬族较集中的遵义市正平乡，解放前竟有60％以上农民穿棕衣。在那时，仡佬族没人识字，被国民党反动派禁止讲本民族语言，甚至不准承认自己是仡佬族。
    1949年冬天，随着祖国西南地区的解放，这个被摧残得奄奄一息的古老民族得到新生，享受到当家作主的权利。虽然仡佬族人数不多，居住很分散，但1956年，在遵义市正平乡和仁怀县安良乡建立了两个仡佬族自治乡；散居在各地的仡佬族人民也参加了所在地各级人民代表大会和政府工作。
    在国家的大力扶植和汉族人民帮助下，仡佬族地区生产蓬勃发展。在农业方面，人们积肥、兴修水利，精耕细作，粮食产量不断提高，到1957年，就根本改变了解放前80％以上农民缺粮的状况，一跃而变为有余粮外调的地区。大方县长石乡解放时每人平均只有二百二十七斤粮，1957年达到五百四十斤。遵义市正平乡1958年实现公社化以后，粮食亩产已达到全国农业发展纲要中规定的八百斤指标，每户还养有八、九头猪，由过去被人称作的“棕衣乡”变为“棉衣乡”。
    生产上的跃进使仡佬族人民的生活得到很大改善。在这一年，基本上消灭了文盲，普及了小学教育；每一个仡佬族的村寨里都有了医疗卫生机构。无论在生产还是生活上，都日益接近当地汉族人民的水平。
