　　Seeing the news of the people of Guangdong fighting the floods these past few days fills one with concern, excitement, and inspiration.

　　Under the care of the Central Committee and the people of the whole country, and under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of Guangdong have waged a serious battle against the extraordinary flood peak and achieved a brilliant victory. In the struggle, many commendable and moving heroic deeds have emerged. The heroic acts described in communications such as "Communist Party Members in the Fight Against Floods," "Rescue on the Journey," and "Military Life" are deeply moving. We feel boundless glory and pride in our socialist motherland for having such heroic people and soldiers of the people. Only under the leadership and education of the Party and Chairman Mao can we have such noble moral qualities and spiritual outlook.

　　Look, the passengers and crew members on the journey stopped to help block the breach in the embankment: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party members, they immediately became an excellent combat team." Among them were "PLA soldiers, workers, old men, women, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau." They assisted the local farmers in fighting for seven hours, and only when the breach was about to be closed were they repeatedly persuaded to reluctantly return to the ship. Who can not feel honored and proud of this communist spirit? The victory of the people of Guangdong over the extraordinary floods once again proves that the great power of the people under the leadership of the Party can overcome all difficulties. No difficulty can stop our progress. Let us wish the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, and other places, who are fighting against the flood disaster, to make persistent efforts and strive for greater victories; and extend our cordial greetings and high respect to the heroic soldiers and civilians on the front line of the struggle!

    关心、兴奋和感动
    看到这几天广东人民同洪水搏斗的消息，令人十分关心、兴奋和感动。
    广东人民在中央和全国人民关怀下，在党和政府领导下，同特大洪峰进行了严重搏斗，取得了辉煌的胜利。在斗争中，涌现出很多可歌可颂的英雄事迹。像“抗洪斗争中的共产党员”、“旅途抢险”、“军生”等通讯中所表述的英雄行为，令人深深地感动。我们为社会主义祖国有着这样的英雄人民、人民子弟兵感到无上的光荣和自豪。只有在党和毛主席的领导和教养下，才能有这样高尚道德品质和精神面貌。
    请看，正在旅途中的旅客们和船员们，他们停航去抢堵围堤的决口：“他们在共产党员们的领导下，立刻成为一支出色的战斗队伍。”其中“有解放军战士、工人、老大爷、妇女和港澳同胞”。他们协助当地农民奋战七小时，到决口将要合龙时，才被一再劝说而勉强回到船上。谁能不被这种共产主义的精神感到光荣和自豪呢？广东人民战胜特大洪水，再一次证明，在党领导下的伟大的人民力量能够战胜一切困难。任何困难都阻挡不住我们前进的道路。让我们预祝正在同洪水灾害搏斗的广东、广西、江西、湖北、福建等地的广大军民再接再厉，争取更大的胜利；并向斗争前线的英雄军民致以亲切慰问和崇高敬意！
