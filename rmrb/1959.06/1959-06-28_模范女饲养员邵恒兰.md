    Model Female Herdsman Shao Henglan
    Shao Henglan, a female herdsman from Tangtou People's Commune in Sinan County, Guizhou Province, has been taking care of livestock since 1956. She has not taken a single jin of feed from the commune, nor has she spent a single penny of the commune's money. In three years, she has bred the original six cows and two calves given to her by the commune into twenty-one head of cattle. She has also newly raised ten pigs and eight sheep. These livestock are all strong and in good condition throughout the year, and the female animals never fail to conceive, creating enormous wealth for the country and the collective. In 1957 and 1958, Shao Henglan was elected as a labor model of the county and province, becoming a red flag among herdsmen in the mountainous areas.
    Shao Henglan is a 32-year-old poor peasant woman. From the first day she became a herdsman, she took great care in raising and looking after the livestock, observing and familiarizing herself with the living habits of each animal. When she noticed that some cows ate grass faster, slower, more, or less than others, she implemented zoned grazing, putting those with poor appetites and slow eaters closer to the mountain, and the rest further away. When bringing them in, she would bring in the ones further away first and then the ones closer, so that each cow could eat well and be full. She also adopted the method of grazing in fixed areas and at fixed times according to the seasonal climate changes: in cold weather, she would delay grazing in the morning and bring them in early in the evening to prevent the livestock from getting cold; in hot weather, she would graze them in the early morning and late evening, grazing them on the east side of the mountain in the morning and on the west slope in the evening to minimize exposure to the scorching sun; in the cool spring and autumn weather, she would let the cows go out early and return late. When the mountain grass was lush, she also diligently cut grass on the slopes to dry it or make silage to store "grain" for the cows to get through the winter. Last summer and autumn, in three or four months, she cut a total of more than 60,000 jin of grass, which not only allowed the cattle to safely get through the winter, but also made each one strong and fat. Usually, she wears a cattle comb on her belt and takes time to catch lice and groom the cattle whenever she has a spare moment. She has also given each cow various names, and they come when she calls them. In Shao Henglan's words: My cows are more obedient and well-behaved than babies!
    Shao Henglan is not satisfied with just making sure the livestock eat and sleep well. She also actively learns and masters the techniques of estrus, mating, and disease prevention for female animals. She humbly takes traditional Chinese veterinarians as her teachers. After more than a year of study, she has learned to use more than ten kinds of herbal medicines to treat seven common cattle diseases. Thanks to her careful care, no cattle have died in recent years.

    模范女饲养员邵恒兰
    贵州省思南县塘头人民公社女饲养员邵恒兰，从1956年担任看管牲口以来，没有领社里一斤饲料，也没有花社里一个钱，一个人在三年间把原来社里交给她的六头母牛和两头小牛，繁殖成现在的二十一头耕牛，还新养了十头猪、八头羊。这些牲口头头健壮，四季满膘，母畜从不空怀，为国家和集体创造了巨大财富。在1957年和1958年，邵恒兰都当选县和省的劳动模范，成为山区饲养员中的一面红旗。
    邵恒兰是个三十二岁的贫农妇女，从她担任饲养员的第一天起，就非常精心地饲养照料牲畜，观察、熟悉每一头牲口的生活习性。当她发现牛吃草有快有慢、有多有少，就实行分区放牧，让胃口差又吃得慢的放在近山，其余的放远山；收牧时先远后近，使每头牛都能吃好吃饱。她又根据各个季节气候变化，采取定地区、定时放牧的办法：冷天放牧晚牧早收，免得牲口挨冻；热天早晚两头放牧，早放东山，晚放西坡，少受烈日烤晒；春秋天气凉爽，就让牛早出晚归。在山草茂密的时候，她还辛勤地在坡上割草晒干或制青贮饲料，给牛储备越冬“粮食”，去年夏秋三、四个月里，她共割草六万多斤，使耕牛不但安全过冬，还个个膘肥体壮。平时，她把牛篦子别在腰带上，一有空就给牛捉虱理毛。她还给每头牛取了各种各样的名字，喊哪个哪个到，一呼就去。用邵恒兰的一句话说：我的牛呀，比奶娃还乖巧听话！
    邵恒兰并不满足于只做到使牲口吃好睡好，还积极学习掌握母畜的发情、配种和防治牲畜疾病的技术。她虚心拜中兽医为师，经过一年多的钻研，学会用十多种草药治疗七种常见的牛病。由于她细心抚养，几年来没有一头牛死亡。
