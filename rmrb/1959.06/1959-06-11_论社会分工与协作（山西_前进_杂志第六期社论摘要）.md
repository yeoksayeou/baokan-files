On Social Division of Labor and Cooperation
(Abstract from the Sixth Issue of "Forward" Magazine, Shanxi)

To increase labor productivity by every possible means is the most fundamental condition for carrying out socialist construction at high speed. Lenin said in "A Great Beginning": "In the last analysis, productivity of labor is the most important, the principal thing for the victory of the new social system." In the production process, a rational social division of labor and extensive social cooperation are extremely important aspects of increasing labor productivity. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, labor productivity in all sectors of the national economy has generally increased significantly, thereby successfully completing and over fulfilling various production and construction tasks. These achievements mark the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and also mark a new development in social division of labor and cooperation.

Some abnormal phenomena appeared during the Great Leap Forward: some divisions of labor were disrupted, and some cooperative relationships were interrupted.

However, while affirming the achievements, which are the main aspect, we must also see the other aspect of the problem. That is, during the Great Leap Forward, some abnormal phenomena appeared in the area of social division of labor and cooperation. These abnormal phenomena mainly manifested in the disruption of certain divisions of labor and the interruption of certain cooperative relationships between regions, cities, urban and rural areas, enterprises, and departments within enterprises during the development of the national economy. Economic ties between regions and regions, cities and rural areas include both the supply and demand of means of production and the supply and demand of means of subsistence. If this relationship becomes abnormal, there will be a shortage of certain products, a decline in quality, a disconnection in the supply of certain raw materials, and an imbalance in the supply of certain daily necessities. Although these shortcomings are minor compared to our great achievements, and are in the ratio of nine fingers to one finger, and there is no need to be alarmed, if these problems are not actively resolved and allowed to develop unchecked, it will be very detrimental to the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, while summarizing the successful experiences of the Great Leap Forward, we must face up to the shortcomings and errors in our work and draw useful lessons from them. So, why did these abnormal phenomena occur in the area of social division of labor and cooperation?

It is necessary to respect the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, and not to only focus on key construction while neglecting general construction.

As everyone knows, in order to meet their living needs, people engage in various industries and various production activities in society. Some engage in industrial production, some in agricultural production, some in commercial activities, and some in transportation activities... Within industrial production, there is a division of labor between heavy industry, light industry, food industry, etc. There are also various divisions of labor in agriculture and transportation. These many industries form an organic whole of social production. Within this whole, there is a division of labor and cooperation relationship that is interdependent between various industries. Therefore, social division of labor and cooperation are objective laws that exist in the social production process. However, the socialist economy is a planned economy, and social division of labor and cooperation must be governed by the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy. To handle this proportional relationship properly, it is necessary to handle a series of relationships well, such as key and general, heavy industry and light industry, industry and agriculture, production and capital construction, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, urban and rural areas, regions and regions, departments and departments, and so on. There is no doubt that prioritizing the development of heavy industry, guaranteeing key projects, and strengthening the main attack line are principles that must be followed in correctly handling the above series of relationships, and are also required by socialist economic construction. We have done this in the past and must continue to do so in the future. If we do not distinguish between importance and urgency and use our strength evenly, we will achieve nothing. In our province, the current problem is that the requirements for key construction are too high and too urgent, the scope of capital construction is too wide, while the attention given to light industry and certain secondary raw material industries related to production and life is too light, that is, not enough attention is paid to the secondary battle lines that cooperate with the main attack line. In addition, the allocation of labor and raw materials in urban and rural areas and within urban industry is not completely rational. The increase in urban industrial employment is too fast and too much, which not only affects the shortage of labor in agricultural production, but also affects the tension in urban market supply. The emergence of this situation has directly caused a certain degree of imbalance in the social division of labor and cooperation. Some industries were forced to switch to other industries in order to meet the needs of key projects, such as changing the ceramics industry into a refractory material factory, and concentrating many ironware handicrafts into smelting enterprises. Some industries were forced to reduce or stop production due to the shortage of labor, equipment, and raw materials. Because some social divisions of labor were disrupted, part of the cooperative relationship between regions and regions, cities and cities, and departments and departments were also interrupted. As a result, some inexpensive and useful necessities have been reduced or disappeared. Some factories and mines were forced to produce products that they should not have produced in the first place, or produced many low-quality products with substitutes. It can be seen from the above situation that it is very important to constantly and timely make necessary adjustments to the relationship between key and general projects, and the relationship between the main attack line and the secondary battle lines that cooperate with the main attack line. Our past lack of understanding of this point is also a lack of understanding of the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy. This is the root cause of the abnormal phenomena in the area of social division of labor and cooperation.

The rational parts of the social division of labor and cooperation inherited from the old society should be retained, and the irrational parts should be gradually changed.

Another important reason for the abnormal phenomena in the area of social division of labor and cooperation is that our cadres have an unclear understanding of the development trend of social division of labor and cooperation. As mentioned above, during the Great Leap Forward, social division of labor and cooperation have undergone new developments, and the further the socialist construction cause advances, the more perfect the social division of labor and cooperation will become. This is an inevitable trend of historical development, and there is no need to have the slightest doubt. However, the development process of social division of labor and cooperation, like other things, must be a gradual process of moving from old to new, from low to high, and from simple to complex on the original basis. This is the case both in a region and within an enterprise. Anyone who acts beyond this law will inevitably encounter setbacks. Social division of labor and cooperation is an inevitable phenomenon in various social production processes, and is not unique to socialist society. In exploitative class societies, due to the private ownership of the means of production, although social division of labor and cooperation is carried out in pursuit of profit, and it has the nature of class exploitation and spontaneity, it has also played a role in promoting the increase of labor productivity. Therefore, the forms of social division of labor and cooperation inherited from the old society must be treated analytically, and should not be discarded altogether, but should retain its rational parts and gradually change its irrational parts. The so-called gradually changing the old irrational parts means that when the new division of labor and cooperation relationship has not yet been established and cannot replace the old division of labor and cooperation relationship, even the irrational parts of the old division of labor and cooperation cannot be changed or cancelled rashly, otherwise, the drawbacks of the disconnection between the old and the new will occur, causing undue difficulties in our economic life. At the same time, when developing new forms of social division of labor and cooperation, it must be deployed rationally, both starting from the overall situation and adapting to local conditions, in order to utilize human and material resources most economically. For example, in industrial production, in our province, the speed and scale of industrial development is very fast and large. However, when deploying production, we must not only see our historical conditions, natural conditions, and economic conditions, but also make overall considerations based on the principle of the whole country as one chessboard. We cannot only start from subjective wishes, only focus on the local, disregard objective conditions, disregard the whole, and demand everything to be complete and self-contained. At the current stage, the main thing is how to make the national industrial system sound, rather than each region having to be self-contained, otherwise, it will destroy the whole country as one chessboard, which is detrimental to the development of the country's entire industrial production. Moreover, it has been proven both theoretically and practically that establishing an industrial system is by no means an easy task, and the subjective initiative of people must not be overestimated. At the same time, when deploying production, it should be as economical and rational as possible, using local materials and local people, and avoiding the waste of human and material resources. In dealing with the reorganization of handicraft production, a very cautious attitude should also be taken. It must be understood that in the case of a relatively backward economy and relatively low technical conditions, handicraft production plays a very important role in meeting the needs of the people for production tools and daily necessities, and in supplying raw materials to modern industry. Even when the degree of industrialization is quite high, certain handicraft products are still impossible to be replaced. It can be seen that handicraft production occupies an indispensable supplementary position in the entire national economy for a long time. Therefore, handicraft production methods can gradually develop towards semi-mechanization and mechanization, but handicraft products cannot be easily changed. The same is true for agricultural production, not only because most of the raw materials for light industry and part of the raw materials for heavy industry come from rural areas, and the grain and non-staple food needed by cities come from rural areas, and the labor force needed to develop industry mainly comes from rural areas, but also because of natural conditions and historical conditions, there is a division of labor in crop planting and other production. Of course, these natural conditions and historical conditions are not forever unchanging, but changing this situation also requires both seeing the needs of the local people and taking into account the needs of the whole society. We emphasize that the production policy of the people's communes must be to develop diverse economies in accordance with local conditions, and to combine self-sufficiency production with commodity production. This is necessary for both production and life, and it is also required by social division of labor and cooperation.

The higher the level of social productive forces, the finer the social division of labor, and the more able it is to push social productive forces to a higher level.

In addition, since the Great Leap Forward, we have emphasized the development of diversified operations within factories and mines, and advocated that workers learn to be "all-rounders" and master multiple technologies. As a result, some people believe that the Great Leap Forward seems to require the social division of labor to be as coarse as possible. This is obviously a misunderstanding. On the contrary, the social division of labor is a sign of the growth of social productive forces. The higher the level of social productive forces, the finer the social division of labor, and the finer the social division of labor, the more able it is to push social productive forces to a higher level. With the forward development of social productive forces, there have been three major social divisions of labor in human history, namely, the division of labor between agriculture and animal husbandry, the division of labor between agriculture and handicrafts, and the emergence of commerce specializing in the exchange of products. In capitalist society, due to the development of machine production, the social division of labor has been greatly promoted. Under the socialist system, the social division of labor is becoming more and more detailed because it has opened up a broader road for the highly development of science and technology. Facts have proved that large-scale production with modern science and technology increasingly requires to develop towards specialization with finer division of labor. Because the implementation of production specialization is conducive to faster improving production technology, conducive to quickly cultivating various skilled technical personnel, conducive to accumulating production experience, thereby conducive to improving labor productivity and developing social productive forces. Lenin once said: "This specialization, in its essence, is as limitless as the development of technology. To improve the productivity of human labor in manufacturing a part of the whole product, it is necessary to specialize the production of this part, making it a special production that manufactures large quantities of products and can (and needs) to use machines, etc." However, production specialization does not exclude the development of certain large factories and mines into comprehensive joint enterprises. Specialization and joint are two opposing aspects contained in a unified object. The production process of each product in modern industrial production is a process of joint of various specialties. The good achievements of some factories and mines in developing multi-variety production and running "satellite" factories and enterprises are the most powerful proof. However, the development of comprehensive joint enterprises must be based on the production characteristics and technical conditions of the department, and must not be like some factories and mines, regardless of whether the conditions are allowed, blindly develop "satellite" factories, and put forward the slogan of "do not ask anyone for anything"; even more cannot be like some workshops, which fundamentally violate the principles of division of labor and industry, from mining ore to manufacturing machines, they have to do it themselves, resulting in huge waste of human and material resources. There are also some departments that, in order to develop "satellite" factories, arbitrarily interrupt their cooperative relationship of supplying raw materials to others, resulting in little benefit to themselves and great harm to others. This approach is also a waste of human and material resources. Of course, there is another situation, during the Great Leap Forward, some raw materials needed by some enterprises were temporarily interrupted their original cooperative relationship, and some difficulties appeared in production. But even so, "satellite" factories should not be run or some workshops should not be expanded under conditions that do not allow it, it is best to actively find ways to restore the original cooperative relationship or establish new cooperative relationships.

It is true that the needs of production development require a person to master several technologies related to his own job in addition to being proficient and skilled in the technology of his own job, and to develop into an "all-rounder." It is an inevitable trend on the basis of mechanization, automation and fine division of labor for a person to master multiple technologies. Because, the higher the degree of mechanization and automation, the finer the division of labor, the simpler the technical operation of each job, and the greater the possibility for workers to learn multiple technologies. Since the Great Leap Forward, many outstanding "all-rounders" have emerged and have made very considerable achievements. However, the leaders of some factories and mines have not seen that the technical and cultural level of workers is relatively low, the degree of mechanization and automation is not high, and it is still difficult to master multiple technologies, the objective situation. One-sided emphasis on everyone to be an "all-rounder", while each person should first be proficient in the technology of his own job, but it has been ignored. As a result, the technical level of workers has improved very slowly, and the quality of products has also declined. Another phenomenon that deserves attention is that some factories and mines, while emphasizing that workers participate in enterprise management and cadres participate in labor (which is of course correct), have even cancelled full-time team leaders, quality inspectors, and safety inspectors, etc., which has greatly weakened production management work and created a state of no one being responsible.

Cooperation is a manifestation of socialist production relations and a universal principle of building socialism.

Social division of labor and cooperation are interrelated and interdependent. The finer the social division of labor, the more cooperation is required. Cooperation is required by the socialist system, and it is a manifestation of socialist production relations and a universal principle of building socialism. Therefore, under the socialist system, it is entirely possible for regions and regions, cities and rural areas, departments and departments, enterprises and enterprises, and departments within enterprises to carry out extensive cooperation based on mutual needs. In the past few years, especially since 1958, we have achieved great achievements and rich experience in organizing social cooperation. Moreover, many regions, many departments, and many enterprises have actively and gratuitously helped newly built factories and mines to design, install equipment, and train workers, etc.; cities have transferred technical personnel and materials to help rural areas build water conservancy projects; rural areas have also helped cities solve difficulties such as labor shortage and raw material shortage; the broad masses of people in cities and rural areas have done a lot of voluntary labor. These are all communist factors and should be cherished and cultivated. Here, it is necessary to distinguish between the socialist cooperation and the communist cooperation. Communist cooperation is uncompensated, while socialist cooperation must be an equivalent exchange. Because the nature of cooperation is determined by the nature of the social mode of production. Under the socialist system, due to the existence of two forms of ownership, ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, the distribution system is basically still the system of distribution according to work, and due to the limitations of the level of social production and the level of ideological awareness of the people, if there is too much uncompensated communist cooperation, it will in fact dampen the labor enthusiasm of the people, and hinder various units from implementing economic accounting, causing chaos in management and operations, which is detrimental to the development of production. In the socialist construction stage, socialist cooperation of equivalent exchange should be basic. Communist cooperation can be advocated under certain conditions. In rural areas, people's communes and management areas should continue to carry forward the spirit of "the poor catch up with the rich, and the rich help the poor." In cities, various departments and enterprises should continue to carry forward the spirit of "the large lead the small, and the small help the large." Of course, this communist cooperation should be restrained.

There are two types of social cooperation: one is cooperation within the national plan, and the other is cooperation outside the national plan. Various regions, departments, and enterprises should first ensure the completion of the cooperation tasks stipulated within the national plan, because this is of decisive significance for completing the national economic construction plan. However, it is impossible for the labor force, raw materials, etc. that the state allocates to various regions, departments, and enterprises according to the plan to be completely appropriate. Therefore, it is still possible for various regions, departments, and enterprises to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and to cooperate extensively.

    论社会分工与协作
    （山西“前进”杂志第六期社论摘要）
    千方百计地提高劳动生产率，是高速度地进行社会主义建设最根本的条件。列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中说：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的东西。”而在生产过程中，合理地进行社会分工，广泛地开展社会协作，是提高劳动生产率极其重要的一个方面。1958年大跃进以来，国民经济各部门的劳动生产率，都普遍地有了显著的提高，从而出色地完成和超额完成了各项生产建设任务。这些成绩标志着党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，同时也标志着社会分工和协作有了新的发展。
    大跃进中出现了一些不正常的现象：某些分工被打乱了，某些协作关系中断了
    但是，当我们肯定了成绩的方面，也是主要的方面之后，同时也要看到另一方面的问题。这就是在大跃进中，在社会分工与协作的问题上，出现了一些不正常的现象。这些不正常的现象，主要表现在国民经济发展的过程中，地区与地区、城市与城市、城市与乡村、企业与企业以及企业内部各部门之间的某些分工被打乱了，某些协作关系中断了。地区与地区、城市与乡村之间的经济联系，既有生产资料的供求关系，也有生活资料的供求关系，这种关系不正常了，就会发生某些产品数量不足、质量下降的现象，就会发生某些原材料供应脱节的现象，就会发生某些日用必需品供应失调的现象。尽管这些缺点和我们伟大的成绩比较起来是次要的，是九个指头和一个指头的关系，是用不着大惊小怪的，但如果对这些问题，不积极地加以解决，任其自流地发展，对于社会主义建设事业就是十分不利的。因此，我们在总结大跃进的成功经验的同时，必须正视我们工作中的缺点和错误，从中吸取有益的教训。那么，在社会分工与协作问题上，为什么会出现这些不正常的现象呢？
    要尊重国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律，不能只重视重点建设，忽视一般建设
    大家知道，人们为了满足自己的生活需要，在社会上便从事各种各样的行业，进行各种各样的生产活动。有的从事工业生产活动，有的从事农业生产活动，有的从事商业活动，有的从事交通运输业活动……。在工业生产中，又有重工业、轻工业、食品工业等等的分工。在农业和交通运输业中，也有种种分工。这许许多多的行业，组成了一个有机的社会生产整体。在这个整体内，各种行业之间都有着相互依存的分工协作关系。所以社会分工与协作，是社会生产过程中客观存在的规律。但是，社会主义经济是计划经济，社会分工与协作，又必须受国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律所支配。要把这种比例关系处理得当，就需要处理好重点和一般、重工业和轻工业、工业和农业、生产和基本建设、大型企业和中小型企业、城市和乡村、地区和地区、部门和部门等等一系列的关系。毫无问题，优先发展重工业，保证重点，加强主攻战线，是正确处理上述一系列关系必须遵守的原则，也是社会主义经济建设所要求的。我们过去就是这样做了的，今后也必须这样做。如果不分轻重缓急，平均使用力量，那就会一事无成。就我省来说，当前的问题是，对重点建设的要求偏高偏急，基本建设的铺点过多过宽，而对于有关生产和生活的轻工业和某些次要的原材料工业照顾的偏轻偏少，也就是对于配合主攻战线的次要战线注意的不够。另外，在城市与乡村，城市工业内部，在劳动力和原材料的分配上，也不够完全合理。城市工业用人增加得过快过多，这不仅影响到农业生产方面的劳动力不足，而且也影响到城市市场供应的紧张。由于这种情况的出现，就直接引起了社会分工与协作在某种程度上的失调。有的行业为了满足重点的需要，被迫转为其他行业，如把陶瓷业改变成耐火材料厂，把许多铁器手工业集中起来变成冶炼企业。有的行业由于劳动力、设备、原材料的不足，被迫减少或者停止生产。由于某些社会分工被破坏了，地区与地区、城市与城市、部门与部门之间的一部分协作关系也就被打断了。因而，使一部分值钱不多、用处不小的必需品减少了，或者没有了。有些厂矿，被迫生产本来自己不应当生产的产品，或者以代用品生产了许多质量很低的产品。从上述情况可以看出，对于重点与一般的关系，主攻战线和配合主攻战线的次要战线的关系，经常地及时地加以必要的调整，是十分重要的。我们过去对这点认识的不足，也就是对国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律认识不足。这便是在社会分工与协作方面产生了某些不正常现象的根本原因。
    对旧社会遗留下来的社会分工与协作的形式，应保留其合理部分，逐步改变其不合理的部分
    在社会分工与协作方面产生了某些不正常现象的另一个重要原因是，在我们的干部中，对社会分工与协作的发展趋势认识不清。如前所述，在大跃进中，社会分工与协作有了新发展，而且社会主义建设事业越向前进，社会分工与协作也就越臻完善，这是一个历史发展的必然趋势，用不着有丝毫的怀疑。但是，社会分工与协作和其他事物一样，它的发展过程，也必须是在原有基础上，由旧到新，由低到高，由简到繁地逐步前进的过程。这不论是在一个地区，还是在一个企业内部，都是如此。谁要超越这个规律而行事，那就必然要碰钉子。社会分工与协作，是各个社会生产过程中的一种必然现象，并不是社会主义社会所独有的。在剥削阶级社会里，由于生产资料的私人占有制，社会分工与协作，虽然是为了追求利润而进行的，它带有阶级剥削和自发的性质，但是它对于提高劳动生产率同样起了促进作用。所以，对于旧社会遗留下来的社会分工与协作的形式，一定要有分析地加以对待，不应当采取一概抛弃的办法，而应当保留其合理的部分，逐步改变其不合理的部分。所谓要逐步地改变旧的不合理的部分，就是说，当新的分工与协作关系还没有建立起来，不能代替旧的分工与协作关系的时候，即使对旧的分工与协作的不合理部分，也不能贸然改变或取消，不然就会发生新旧脱节的弊病，致使我们的经济生活产生不应有的困难。同时，在发展新的社会分工与协作形式的时候，一定要部署的合理，既要从全局出发，又要因地制宜，以便最经济地利用人力和物力。譬如在工业生产上，就我省来说，工业发展的速度和规模是很快很大的。但是，我们在部署生产的时候，不仅要看到我们的历史条件、自然条件和经济条件，而且还必须根据全国一盘棋的原则，作通盘的考虑。不能只从主观愿望出发，只从局部着眼，不顾客观条件，不顾整体，要求样样求全，自成体系。在目前阶段，主要的是如何使全国的工业体系健全起来，而不是每个地区都要自成体系，否则就要破坏全国一盘棋，对国家的整个工业生产的发展不利。而且从理论上和实践上都证明，建立一套工业体系，决不是一件轻而易举的事情，决不能把人的主观能动性估计得太高了。同时，在部署生产的时候，要尽可能作到经济合理，就地取材，就地取人，避免人力物力的浪费。在对待手工业生产的改组问题上，也应当采取十分慎重的态度。必须了解，在经济比较落后、技术条件还相当低的情况下，手工业生产在满足人民的生产工具和生活用品的需要上，对现代化工业的原料的供应上，都有非常重要的作用。即使到了工业化程度相当高的时候，某些手工业产品仍然是不可能被代替的。由此可见，在整个国民经济中，手工业生产长期占有不可缺少的补充地位。因此，手工业生产方法可以逐步地向半机械化、机械化发展，但手工业产品却是不能轻易改变的。在农业生产上也是如此，这不仅因为大部分轻工业的原料和一部分重工业的原料要来自农村，城市所需要的粮食、副食品要来自农村，发展工业所需要的劳动力主要也来自农村，而且由于自然条件和历史条件的原因，在作物种植上和其他生产上也是有分工的。当然，这种自然条件和历史条件，并不是永远不变的，但是改变这种状况，同样要既看到当地人民的需要，也要照顾到整个社会的需要。我们强调人民公社的生产方针必须是因地制宜地发展多种经济，自给性生产和商品性生产并举，这一方面是生产和生活所必需的，另一方面也是社会分工和协作所要求的。
    社会生产力的水平愈高，社会分工就愈细，也就愈能把社会生产力推向更高的水平
    另外，在大跃进以来，我们曾经强调过在厂矿企业内部发展多种经营，提倡工人学习“多面手”，掌握多种技术。于是有的人便认为，好像大跃进要求社会分工越粗越好。这显然是一种误解。恰恰相反，社会分工，是社会生产力增长的标志。社会生产力的水平愈高，社会分工就愈细，社会分工愈细，就愈能把社会生产力推向更高的水平。随着社会生产力的向前发展，在人类历史上，曾经出现过三次社会大分工，即农业和畜牧业的分工，农业和手工业的分工，以及专门从事产品交换的商业的出现。到了资本主义社会，由于机器生产的发展，又大大促进了社会分工。在社会主义制度下，由于给科学技术的高度发展开辟了更为广阔的道路，社会分工也就越来越细。事实证明，拥有现代科学技术的大生产，日益要求向分工愈细的专业化发展。因为实行生产专业化，就有利于更快地提高生产技术，有利于迅速地培养各种熟练的技术人材，有利于积累生产经验，从而也就有利于提高劳动生产率，发展社会生产力。列宁曾经说过：“这种专业化，按其实质来说，正像技术的发展一样没有止境。要把制造整个产品的某一部分的人类劳动的生产率提高，就必须使这部分的生产专业化，使它成为一种制造大量产品因而可以（而且需要）使用机器等等的特种生产。”但是，生产专业化，并不排斥某些大型厂矿向综合性的联合企业发展。专业与联合，是统一物包含着的两个对立方面。现代工业生产每一种产品的生产过程，都是各种专业联合的过程。有些厂矿发展多品种生产和举办“卫星”厂所取得的良好成绩，就是最有力的证明。但是发展综合性的联合企业，必须是以该部门的生产特点和技术条件为前提，决不能像有些厂矿那样，不管条件是否允许，盲目地发展“卫星”厂，提出什么
  “万事不求人”的口号；更不能像有些车间，根本违反分工分业的原则，从开采矿石到制造机器都要自己来干，结果造成了人力和物力的巨大浪费。也有这样一些部门，他们为了发展“卫星”厂，随意把自己供应别人原材料的协作关系打断，结果是自己的收益不大，对别人的危害不小。这种做法在人力和物力上同样是一种浪费。当然也有另外一种情况，在大跃进中，有些企业所需要的某些原材料，暂时中断了原有的协作关系，在生产上出现了一些困难。但即使如此，也不应当在条件不具备的情况下，举办“卫星”厂，或者扩大某些车间，最好还是积极设法恢复原有的协作关系，或者建立新的协作关系。
    诚然，由于生产发展的需要就要求一个人除过精通和熟练本工种的技术外，还要学会同本工种有联系的若干工种的技术，向“多面手”发展。一个人掌握多种技术，这是在机械化、自动化和精细分工基础上的一种必然趋势。因为，机械化、自动化的程度愈高，分工愈细，每个工种的技术操作就越简单，工人学会多种技术的可能性就越大。在大跃进以来，已经涌现出许多出色的
  “多面手”，并且做出了非常可观的成绩。但是，有些厂矿的领导者，由于没有看到工人的技术文化水平较低，机械化、自动化程度还不高，掌握多种技术尚很困难的客观情况，片面地强调人人要当“多面手”，而各自首先应当精通本工种的技术，却被忽视了。结果工人的技术水平提高得很慢，产品的质量也降低了。值得引起注意的另一种现象是，某些厂矿在强调工人参加企业管理，干部参加劳动（这当然是对的）的时候，竟把专职的工段长、质量检查员、安全检查员等都取消了，以致大大地削弱了生产管理工作，造成无人负责的状态。
    协作是社会主义生产关系的一种表现，也是建设社会主义的一条普遍原则
    社会分工与协作，两者是互为联系，相依为命的。社会分工越细，就越要求协作。协作，是社会主义制度所要求的，是社会主义生产关系的一种表现，也是建设社会主义的一条普遍原则。因此，在社会主义制度下，地区与地区、城市与乡村、部门与部门、企业与企业以及企业内部各部门之间，就完全有可能根据相互间的需要，进行广泛的协作。过去几年来，特别是1958年以来，我们在组织社会协作方面，取得了伟大的成绩和丰富的经验。而且有许多地区，许多部门，许多企业，还积极地无代价地帮助新建厂矿进行设计、安装设备、培训工人等；城市抽调技术人材和物资，帮助农村兴修水利；农村也帮助城市解决劳动力和原材料不足等困难；城市和农村的广大群众都做了许多义务劳动。这些都是共产主义的因素，是应当爱护和培植的。在这里，把社会主义性质的协作，和共产主义性质的协作的界限划分一下是有必要的。共产主义性质的协作，是不计报酬的，社会主义性质的协作必须是等价交换的。因为协作的性质，是由社会生产方式的性质来决定的。在社会主义制度下，由于还存在着全民所有制和集体所有制两种形式，分配制度基本上还是按劳分配的制度，以及由于社会生产水平和人民群众的思想觉悟水平的限制，如果不付代价的共产主义性质的协作过多了，事实上就会挫伤人民群众的劳动积极性，并且妨害各个单位实行经济核算，造成经营管理上的混乱，对发展生产是不利的。在社会主义建设阶段，实行等价交换的社会主义性质的协作，应当是基本的。共产主义性质的协作，在一定的条件下是可以提倡的，在农村，人民公社与人民公社、管理区与管理区之间，要继续发扬“穷赶富，富帮穷”的精神，在城市，各部门、各企业之间，要继续发扬“大带小，小帮大”的精神。当然，这种共产主义性质的协作，应当是有节制的。
    社会协作有两种：一种是国家计划之内的协作，一种是国家计划之外的协作。各地区、各部门、各企业，应当首先保证完成国家计划之内所规定的协作任务，因为这对于完成国家经济建设计划有决定的意义。但是，国家依据计划分配给各地区、各部门、各企业所需要的劳动力、原材料等，不可能是完全合适的。因此，在各地区、各部门、各企业相互之间，取长补短，以余补缺，广泛地进行协作，还大有可为。
