The Kazakh people, who live in the northwest border of the motherland, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are striving towards the road to prosperity. They have developed from the original individual, single animal husbandry economy to a collective, comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. They have moved from a nomadic life of wandering for thousands of years to settlement. The grasslands are full of vigor, with millions of mu of interconnected farmland, villages with hundreds and thousands of houses, and new towns with orderly streets. The backwardness of the economy, culture, and education left over from history has undergone tremendous changes.

The Kazakh people live in the Altai Mountains, Tianshan Mountains, Junggar Basin, and Ili River Valley in northern Xinjiang. The vast majority are located within the current Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, accounting for 43.4% of the prefecture's population of over 800,000. Because the Kazakh people have lived a single nomadic life for thousands of years, and most of the livestock was owned by herdowners and wealthy herders, the majority of working herders lived in extreme poverty. Before liberation, they wore old sheepskin clothes all year round, had no grain to eat, and only survived by drinking milk. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government vigorously developed the animal husbandry economy in the Kazakh pastoral areas, issued a large number of sheep loans to poor herders, and helped them build homes and establish businesses. Then, before and after the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy, they completed the democratic reform and the socialist transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry, and after the National Day last year, they realized the people's commune system, and jointly established more than 140 people's communes with farmers and herdsmen of other ethnic groups such as Uygur, Xibe, Hui, and Han in the state. The herdowner economy has also been transformed, and 85 joint state-private ranches have been established, enabling the socialist construction of the entire state to leap into a new stage.

Animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion of the autonomous prefecture's national economy. In recent years, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups have regarded the development of animal husbandry production as their main task, so that the total number of livestock in the state has more than doubled compared with 1949, reaching more than 6.99 million, and a large number of fine breeds of Xinjiang fine-wool sheep and Ili horses have been supplied to all parts of the country as breeding and draught animals. Last year alone, it reached more than 100,000 heads. In order to greatly develop the number of livestock and strive to build the autonomous prefecture into a fine breed livestock base in our country, a competition is being launched on the grasslands to increase and protect livestock.

Under the slogan of striving for grain self-sufficiency and building large feed bases, agriculture on the grasslands has made great progress in recent years. The vast number of Kazakh herdsmen, under the guidance and assistance of the Uygur, Xibe, Hui, Han and other ethnic groups engaged in agricultural production in the autonomous prefecture, have vigorously developed water conservancy and learned to grow crops. They not only planted wheat and miscellaneous grains, but also planted rice, cotton, soybeans and other crops. The cultivated land area of the entire autonomous prefecture has expanded by nearly 3 million mu compared with the initial period of liberation in 1949. In the areas where the Kazakh people live, there are no pure pastoral areas with a single nomadic economy. Even the Altai Prefecture, the main grain-deficient pastoral area in history, has achieved self-sufficiency and surplus due to a nine-fold increase in total grain output. This year, Kazakh herdsmen and farmers of other ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture are vigorously improving farming techniques in order to strive for high yields and more harvests. Some of it will be used as feed to develop animal husbandry.

The Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture originally had no industrial base. After the mass iron smelting in the autumn of last year, the autonomous prefecture has established thousands of various industrial and mining enterprises, and new industrial cities have appeared on the grasslands for the first time.

With the development of industry and agriculture, many large and small settlements and new towns that are economic centers have emerged on the grasslands. More than 80% of the Kazakh people have changed their lives of living by water and grass all year round and have settled down in the newly established towns. Hospitals, health centers, clubs, and schools and other health and cultural undertakings have also developed.

    从终年游牧走向定居　单一经济变多种经济
    哈萨克人民生活跃进新阶段
    本报讯　聚居在祖国西北边疆的哈萨克族人民，在中国共产党的正确领导下，奋起奔向繁荣大道，已经从原来个体的、单一的畜牧业经济，发展到了集体的、工农牧业全面发展的多种经济；从千百年来颠沛流离的游牧生活走向了定居。草原上气象万千，出现了几百万亩阡陌相连的农田以及成百上千房舍罗列的村庄和街道整齐的新兴市镇，历史上遗留下来的经济和文化教育事业的落后状况，已经发生了巨大变化。
    哈萨克族人民聚居在新疆北部阿尔泰山、天山、准噶尔盆地和伊犁河谷一带。绝大部分都在现今伊犁哈萨克族自治州境内，占全自治州八十多万人口的43.4％。由于千百年来哈萨克人一直过着单一的游牧生活，而牲畜又多为牧主和富裕牧民所有，多数劳动牧民生活十分贫困。解放以前，他们终年穿着破旧的老羊皮衣，吃不到粮食，只靠喝一些奶子过活。解放以后，党和人民政府在哈萨克牧业地区大力发展畜牧业经济，给贫苦牧民发放了大量的羊只贷款，帮助牧民建家立业，接着在推行民族区域自治前后，完成了民主改革和农牧业的社会主义改造，并在去年国庆后实现了人民公社化，和全州其他维吾尔、锡伯、回、汉等族农牧民联合建立了一百四十多个人民公社。牧主经济也经过改造，建立了八十五个公私合营牧场，使得全州社会主义建设跃进到一个新的阶段。
    畜牧业经济在自治州国民经济中占比重很大。几年来各族农牧民都把发展畜牧业生产当作自己的主要任务，使得全州牲畜总头数比1949年增加了一倍多，达到了六百九十九万多头，并且大量地供应了全国各地新疆细毛羊和伊犁马等优良种畜和耕畜。单是去年一年就达到十万多头。为了大量发展牲畜头数，争取把自治州建设成为我国的优良种畜基地，草原上正在掀起一个你追我赶的增畜保畜运动。
    在力争粮食自给、大建饲料基地的口号下，草原上的农业几年来已经获得了很大的发展。广大的哈萨克牧民在自治州境内维吾尔、锡伯、回、汉等从事农业生产的民族的指导和帮助下，大兴水利，学种庄稼。他们不仅种植了小麦、杂粮，还种植了水稻、棉花和大豆等农作物。全自治州耕地面积比解放初期的1949年已经扩大了近三百万亩，哈萨克人聚居的地方，已经没有了单一游牧经济的纯牧区，甚至历史上缺粮的主要牧区阿勒泰专区，由于粮食总产量增加九倍，也做到了自给有余。今年，哈萨克牧民和自治州境内其他各民族农民一起，大力改进农作技术，力争高产多收。其中一部将当作饲料用来发展畜牧业。
    伊犁哈萨克自治州的工业原来没有什么基础，在去年秋天全民炼铁以后，自治州已经办起了成千的各种工矿企业，草原上第一次出现了新兴的工业城市。
    随着工业和农业的发展，草原上出现了许多大大小小的定居点和经济中心的新市镇，80％以上的哈萨克人已经改变了终年逐水草而居的生活，在新建立的、镇定居下来。医院、卫生所、俱乐部和学校等卫生文化事业也发展起来了。
