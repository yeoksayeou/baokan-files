    The Liaoyang Power Supply Works substation in Liaoning Province has created a record of 3,000 consecutive days of safe power supply as of May 7 this year due to its long-term adherence to the policy of safe production, conscientious implementation of operating procedures, and continuous technological innovation.
    This substation is responsible for the power supply for the water source of Anshan Iron and Steel and railway transportation, as well as the entire industrial and agricultural production and civilian use of Liaoyang City. Over the past few years, it has fully met the needs of production and civilian use. This is a picture of the workers inspecting the power transmission lines. Da Kui (Xinhua News Agency draft)
