Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 25th: Shanxi Province is currently building a batch of daily-use light industrial factories in order to gradually change the backward state of Shanxi's light industry production.

The Shanxi Sugar Factory, under construction in Datong City, with an annual output of 25,000 tons of sugar, has basically completed its civil engineering construction. The Taiyuan Glass Bottle Factory, which is under construction, is a modern factory producing thermos bottles and machine-made bottles; the thermos bottle workshop has already partially started production. The newly built Taiyuan Textile Factory now has 80,000 spindles and more than 400 looms in operation, and its printing and dyeing workshop has also started printing and dyeing calico. The four newly built textile factories in Yuci, Jiexiu, Xinzhou, and Taigu also have some spindles in operation. In addition, the province is also building two modern paper mills with a daily output of 30 to 40 tons, as well as some small paper mills, alcohol factories, and ceramic factories. While building new factories, some existing light industrial factories are also starting to expand.

In order to ensure the supply of raw materials after this batch of light industrial factories are fully put into production, the relevant departments in Shanxi are currently starting to establish raw material bases for light industry such as tobacco leaves and sugar beets.

    山西新建一批轻工业工厂
    新华社太原25日电　山西省正在建设一批日用轻工业工厂，以逐步改变山西轻工业生产的落后面貌。
    在大同市兴建的一座年产两万五千吨糖的山西糖厂，目前土木建筑工程已经基本完成。建设中的太原玻璃瓶厂，是一座现代化的生产保温瓶、机制瓶的工厂，目前保温瓶车间已部分投入生产。新建的太原纺织厂现在已有八万纱锭和四百多台布机投入生产，它的印染车间也开始印染花布了。新建榆次、介休、忻县、太谷四个纺织厂，目前也有部分纱锭投入生产。此外，全省还正在新建两座日产三十吨到四十吨的现代化纸厂，和一些小纸厂、酒精厂、陶瓷厂等。在新建的同时，一些原有的轻工业工厂也在着手扩建。
    为了保证这批轻工业工厂在全部投入生产后的原料供应，山西有关部门目前已着手建立烟叶、甜菜等轻工业原料基地。
