Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, June 22nd: The focus of mechanical, power, and electrical engineering sciences should now be on researching major problems in local production and construction, combined with the development of new technologies and basic science research. This was the conclusion reached at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' recent Mechanical, Power, and Electrical Engineering Professional Work Conference in Changchun. This conclusion clarifies the direction of research for these three scientific fields.

During the Great Leap Forward last year, significant progress was made in the research of mechanical, power, and electrical engineering sciences. Twenty new research units were established in various regions, developing a dedicated team of scientific and technical cadres. Under the leadership of local Party committees, these research units worked closely with universities and production departments, conducting much research around industrial and agricultural production and construction. The regenerative rotary air preheater successfully researched by the Power Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Shaanxi Branch, and the automatic feeder for conical roller grinders and single-cylinder double-stroke internal combustion water pumps successfully researched by the Local Electrification Research Institute of the Jilin Branch, have all been applied in production. Building on the achievements of last year, each research institute has formulated its research plan for this year, proposing more than one hundred and fifty research projects.

After discussion, the conference concluded that the future work of these three scientific fields should focus on researching major problems in local production and construction, combined with the development of new technologies and basic science research. This will allow scientific research to directly serve the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, promote the development of scientific research work, help solve problems such as equipment and backup manpower, and enable research results to be quickly promoted and applied.

The conference also discussed the issues of cadre training and organizational collaboration. The conference believes that the main method of cadre training should be to strive to improve professional skills through work related to research tasks. In addition, hiring part-time researchers (including worker-peasant experts), strengthening guidance, appropriately sending cadres to other research units and universities for further study, and organizing cadres to go to factories and people's communes for internships and visits are also effective methods.

The conference emphasized the close collaboration of scientific research work, believing that this is an important method for the development of science. An important experience for many research units in quickly establishing themselves and achieving success in research work is close cooperation with relevant universities and production departments. At the same time, research units should also frequently exchange scientific research information and work experience, and collaborate with each other.

The conference was attended by heads and researchers from the scientific research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences branches in eighteen provinces and cities, as well as teachers from some relevant universities and engineering and technical personnel from production departments. Yan Jici, Director of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and academicians Shi Zhiren, Zhu Wuhua, Wang Daheng, and Zhang Deqing also attended the conference.

    重大生产问题要放在首位
    科学院机械、动力、电工专业会议确定工作方向
    据新华社长春22日电　机械、动力、电工这三门科学工作，今后应以研究当地生产建设中的重大问题为主，结合开展新技术和基础科学的研究。这是中国科学院最近在长春召开的机械、动力、电工专业工作会议上所作的结论。这个结论明确了这三门科学研究的方向问题。
    在去年大跃进中，机械、动力、电工这三门科学研究工作有了很大发展。各地新建的研究单位达二十个，发展了一支专职科学技术干部队伍。这些研究单位在当地党委领导下，与高等学校、生产部门紧密合作，围绕工农业生产建设作了许多研究工作。中国科学院陕西分院动力研究所研究成功的再生式回转空气预热器，吉林分院地方电气化研究所研究成功的圆锥滚柱磨床自动上料器、单缸双冲程内燃水泵等，都已在生产上应用。各研究所在去年取得成就的基础上，制定今年的研究计划，提出了一百五十多个研究项目。
    这次会议经过讨论，认为今后这三门科学工作应以研究当地生产建设中的重大问题为主，结合开展新技术和基础科学的研究。这样，可以使科学研究工作直接为工农业生产大跃进服务，促进科学研究工作的开展，有助于解决器材及后备人力等问题，研究成果也能很快地得到推广运用。
    会议还讨论了培养干部和组织协作的问题。会议认为，培养干部的主要方法，应该是结合研究任务，在工作中努力提高业务水平。此外，聘请兼职研究人员（包括工农专家），增强指导力量，适当地派干部到其他研究单位和高等学校进修，组织干部到工厂、人民公社去实习参观等，也都是行之有效的方法。
    会议强调了科学研究工作的密切协作问题，认为这是发展科学的重要方法。许多研究单位能够很快地建立起来，在研究工作中取得成就，一条重要的经验就是和有关高等学校、生产部门密切合作。同时，各研究单位也应该经常交流科学研究情报和工作经验，相互协作。
    参加这次会议的有十八个省、市的中国科学院分院科学研究机关的负责人和研究人员，以及有关的一部分高等学校教师和生产部门的工程技术人员等。中国科学院技术科学部主任严济慈，学部委员石志仁、朱物华、王大珩、张德庆等也参加了会议。
