    Being an Excellent People's Teacher
    Students of the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University: Wang Minru, Li Yiwei, Shen Changning

    Our six years of middle school life are coming to an end, and we are about to embark on a new life. This moment is of great significance to every graduate. What kind of work should we engage in in the future? This is something everyone must carefully consider.

    After careful consideration, we finally decided: to take the teacher's college entrance exam and go to the educational front of the motherland! However, our understanding of the work we are about to undertake is not profound, and we are very eager to hear the teachings of the revolutionary predecessors. That day finally came.

    One afternoon, we were received by Old Xu, whom we all respected, and he gave us extremely important instructions regarding some of the issues we were considering about our volunteer work.

    As we walked into the garden, Old Xu was sitting in a wicker chair. As soon as he saw us coming, he quickly got up to greet us and shook hands with us kindly. Old Xu asked about our situation and invited us to sit down. After we greeted Old Xu, we told him about some of the thoughts and questions our classmates had about taking the teacher's college entrance exam. Old Xu gave detailed answers to each question. Cutting-edge science is very important, but don't underestimate the work of teachers. The development of a country's scientific undertakings largely depends on the development of its educational undertakings.

    In the past, we felt that cutting-edge science was particularly important, and that high-caliber, academically excellent, and morally sound students should go to cutting-edge scientific positions; while teacher's college was not so important, and it was enough for ordinary students to study teacher's college.

    After listening to us, Old Xu said: "Cutting-edge science is of course very important; at the same time, 'the capable should be teachers'. It is not necessary for only those who have studied teacher's college to teach. Teacher's college requires not only learning specialized knowledge of education, but also learning broad and comprehensive scientific knowledge, so that teaching will be better." Old Xu also said: "Science is developing, but it is built on the knowledge base of predecessors. Without teachers to spread knowledge, who can create cutting-edge science alone? Don't underestimate the work of teachers. The development of a country's scientific undertakings largely depends on the development of its educational undertakings. Aren't the educational standards of many advanced countries in the world very high? If the Soviet Union did not have such a developed education system, how could it have surpassed the United States in science in such a short period of time? Our country's education system will also have great development in the future."

    Old Xu paused here and looked at us kindly. We also looked at each other. Yes! Our motherland is developing rapidly, and we need so many builders who have mastered a high level of scientific culture in order to reach the most advanced level in the world in all aspects in a very short period of time! The popularization and improvement of national education is an important condition for realizing communism. How can it be achieved without a highly developed cultural and educational undertaking? Under the guidance of the Party's education policy in the past year or so, China's education system has made rapid progress, but it is still far from meeting the needs! Our education system must have a faster rate of development and a great change. Who can say that such an undertaking is not important?

    Then Old Xu emphasized: "Teachers not only impart knowledge, but more importantly, they teach people. The quality of the teacher often affects the quality of the students. A person must not only have scientific knowledge, but also understand social knowledge, that is, know how to be a person. Children are like a blank sheet of paper. If you dye it red, it is red; if you dye it black, it is black. Children grow up under the guidance of teachers. To make them red and expert builders, we must first have red and expert teachers. Therefore, our teachers must have excellent communist qualities, otherwise, how can they have a good influence on the children?" Speaking of this, Old Xu excitedly recalled his sixty years of teaching experience. Old Xu started teaching at the age of sixteen and cultivated many outstanding revolutionaries. Old Xu said: "The Hunan First Normal School where I taught before was a red school, and many of the students who came out of there sacrificed for the revolutionary cause." He also said with great emotion: "Many good teachers are good Party members, such as Chairman Mao, Li Weihan, Zhang Dingcheng, and He Shuheng, who sacrificed during the Long March, also worked as primary school teachers!"

    We thought about it carefully. If there were no good teachers who earnestly implemented the Party's education policy, what would we be like today? We very much hope to have good teachers to educate ourselves, but we are unwilling to be teachers ourselves. If there is no group of enthusiastic and ideal young people to engage in education and inherit the cause of their predecessors, how can the motherland's education system have rapid development! The socialist cause is a collective cause, and excellence must be collective excellence. Moreover, a person's future is not determined by your profession, but by your attitude towards life. As long as you are for the country, you will have a future.

    In the past, we also thought: Being a teacher is just learning the research results that others have already obtained, and then passing them on to others. There can be no inventions or creations, which is not as grand and vigorous as engaging in cutting-edge science. Engaging in cutting-edge science can achieve something in a few years, while being a teacher is just plain and unremarkable, which is meaningless. If you teach well, students will say: "This teacher is not bad"; if you don't teach well, there will be a lot of opinions, which is not worthwhile.

    When Old Xu talked about this issue, he said very seriously: "Some people don't like to take the teacher's college entrance exam because they have been influenced by the old society. Those people don't consider that this is also needed by the country. This kind of thinking that doesn't consider the collective but only the individual has no future."

    Old Xu then talked about the issue of future prospects: Is it that only engaging in cutting-edge science has a future, and engaging in teacher's college has no future? He said: "The socialist cause is a collective cause, and excellence must be collective excellence. To make our cause excellent, we cannot have just one person excellent. Moreover, a person's future is not determined by your profession, but by your attitude towards life and your attitude towards others. As long as you are for the country, have enthusiasm, are willing to use your brain, and care about everything in the world, you will have a future, have achievements, and an ideological lazy person, no matter how smart he is, will accomplish nothing. Therefore, a person should be content with his work, not be fickle, and not always want to 'jump ship'. As the old saying goes, 'Every profession produces its top talent'! No matter what work, as long as it is beneficial to our country, we should do it practically."

    Yes, Old Xu is right. If one's hard work throughout one's life has not earned any special honor, but has only made some contributions to society, and others don't even know that there is such a person, then one would not be willing to do it. What kind of thinking is this? Only wanting to be "famous in the world" and not being able to be "unknown". How can we serve the people well in this way? What the motherland needs are countless unsung heroes! We should not always think that we are special and must do special work. Communist Party members are special people, but they do all kinds of work: low-level work, high-level work, and if no one does it, they will do it themselves. Everyone should have this spirit and do the work that others are unwilling to do.

    We asked again: "Some classmates think that teacher's college is needed by the country, but engaging in cutting-edge science is also needed by the country. What's wrong with that?"

    Old Xu said: "Of course, all our undertakings need people to do them, and cutting-edge science is also very important to our country. However, our cutting-edge science must also have a developed cultural and educational undertaking as its foundation. All undertakings in our motherland need countless people to complete. In this, we should not always think that we are special and must do special work. Communist Party members are special people, but they do all kinds of work: low-level work, high-level work, and if no one does it, they will do it themselves. Communist Party members always go to the most difficult places. Everyone should have this spirit, should have a collective sense of enterprise, not a personal pursuit of fame and profit, so we should do the work that others are unwilling to do. Now the motherland's education system needs a lot of people, which requires many ambitious and aspiring young people to take up this position. It's great that you have decided to do this work. I hope you will not disappoint the cultivation of the Party and the people and become an excellent people's teacher." Old Xu finally patted us on the shoulders and said kindly: "I am very happy that you are all becoming my colleagues." He also said: "But you must pay attention to your health! Being a teacher also requires proper exercise and rest. If your health is damaged, it is a loss to the country." Looking at the kind and amiable Old Xu, we were truly overwhelmed with emotion.

    Yes, we are all members of the Communist Youth League and have grown up under the care of the Party. The Party places great hopes on us and requires us to inherit the cause of our predecessors. However, in the past, we always wanted to pick and choose. We wanted to take the teacher's college entrance exam, but we were reluctant to give up cutting-edge science. At first, when we considered our own conditions, we always emphasized that going to science and technology, aerospace academies... was suitable, but we did not seriously consider that taking the teacher's college entrance exam was also very suitable. Isn't taking the teacher's college entrance exam also needed by the motherland? And we have certain conditions, why not apply for teacher's college? Listening to Old Xu's words made us understand better how we should treat the needs of the Party and the country. We feel that we have thought too little for the country in the past, and we also feel that we have made a very correct choice in choosing the teaching profession. We are determined to become excellent people's teachers and dedicate our lives to the motherland's education system!

    做一个优秀的人民教师
    北京师大附中学生　王敏茹　李宜玮　沈长宁
    六年的中学生活结束了，我们又将走向新的生活。这个时刻对于每个毕业生来说，都是具有重大意义的。今后到底从事什么工作呢？这是每个人都要慎重考虑的。
    我们经过再三考虑，最后决定：考师范，到祖国教育战线上去！但是我们对自己将要从事的工作认识得并不深刻，我们非常渴望听听革命前辈对我们的教导。这一天终于来了。
    一天下午，大家最敬爱的徐老接见了我们，并且对我们考虑志愿方面的一些问题，作了极重要的指示。
    我们走进花园时，徐老正在一把藤椅上坐着。他一见我们走来，就连忙起身迎上前来，和我们亲切地握手。徐老一面问我们的情况，一面请我们坐下。我们向徐老问过好以后，就把我们一些同学对待考师范的一些想法和问题向徐老谈了出来。对于每个问题，徐老都作了详细的解答。尖端科学是很重要的，但也不要小看教师工作。一个国家科学事业的发展，在很大程度上决定于教育事业的发展。
    我们过去觉得尖端科学特别重要，要求的人材高，功课好、品质好的同学都应该到尖端科学事业的岗位上去；而师范不太重要，一般的同学去学师范也就足够了。
    徐老听了我们的话以后，说：“尖端科学当然是很重要的；同时，‘能者为师’，不一定只有学过师范的人才能教书。师范既要学教育的专门知识，还要学广博全面的科学知识，这样教起书来会更好一些。”徐老还说：“科学是发展着的，但它是建立在前人的知识基础上的，如果没有教师传播知识，谁能一个人搞出个尖端呢？不要小看了教师的工作，一个国家科学事业的发展，在很大程度上要决定于教育事业的发展，世界上许多先进国家的教育事业水平不是都很高吗？苏联如果没有那样发达的教育事业，怎么能在那样短的时间内就在科学上超过美国呢？我们国家的教育事业今后也要有很大发展的。”
    徐老谈到这里停了停，慈爱地望着我们，我们也互相看了看。是呀！我们祖国在一日千里地向前发展，我们要在很短的时间内，在各方面都达到世界最先进的水平，祖国需要多少掌握高度科学文化的建设者呀！全民教育的普及和提高是实现共产主义的重要条件，没有高度发展的文化教育事业又怎么能成呢？一年多来在党的教育方针的指导下，我国的教育事业有了飞跃的发展，可是离需要还远得很啊！我们的教育事业还要有一个更快的发展速度、一个很大的改变，谁能说这样的事业不重要呢？
    接着徐老又强调说：“教师不仅是传授知识，更重要的是教人。教师本身的好坏往往影响学生的好坏。一个人不仅要有科学知识，还要懂得社会知识，就是说要会作人。小孩子就像一张白纸，你把他染成红色就是红色，染成黑色就是黑色。小孩子是在教师的培养下成长起来的，要让他们成为又红又专的建设者，这就首先要有又红又专的教师。所以我们的教师都必须有优秀的共产主义品质，不然，怎么能对孩子们有好影响呢？”徐老谈到这里就非常激动地回忆起自己六十多年的教育生活。徐老从十六岁就教书，培养出许多优秀的革命者来。徐老说：“我从前教书的湖南第一师范是个红色的学校，那里出来的学生很多都为革命事业牺牲了。”他还非常感慨地说：“很多好教师都是好党员，像毛主席、李维汉、张鼎丞，还有在长征时牺牲的何叔衡同志也都曾作过小学教员呢！”
    我们自己好好地想了想，如果没有认真贯彻党的教育方针的好教师，我们今天会怎么样呢？我们非常希望能有好的老师来教育自己，可是自己却不愿意去作老师。如果没有一批有热情有理想的优秀青年来从事教育工作，来继承先辈的事业，祖国的教育事业怎么能有飞跃的发展呢！社会主义的事业是集体的事业，出色要大家出色。再说，一个人的前途并不决定于你的职业，而决定于你对待生活的态度。只要你是为国家就会有前途。
    我们过去还曾经想过：当教师只是学习别人已得的研究成果，再传授给别人，不能有发明创造，不如搞尖端轰轰烈烈。搞尖端钻几年就可以有所成就，而当教师就太平平淡淡，没有什么意思。教好了，学生说：“这个老师还不错”；教不好，意见一大堆，太不合算。
    徐老在谈到这个问题时很严肃地说：“有些人不爱考师范，是受了旧社会的影响。那些人不考虑这也是国家需要的，这种不为集体只为个人的思想是没有出路的。”
    徐老接着又谈到前途问题：是不是只有搞尖端才有前途，搞师范就没有前途呢？他说：“社会主义事业是集体的事业，出色要大家出色，要我们的事业出色，而不能一个人出色。再说，一个人的前途并不决定于你的职业，而决定于你对待生活的态度，待人接物的态度，只要你是为国家，有热情，肯用脑，关心世界上的一切东西，就会有前途，有成就，而思想上的懒汉不论他多么聪明，也将一事无成。所以一个人要安心于自己的工作，不要见异思迁，不要总想‘跳行’。古语说得好‘行行出状元’嘛！无论什么工作只要对我们国家有利，就应该踏踏实实地去作。”
    是呀，徐老的话是对的。如果自己一生的辛勤劳动并没有换来什么特殊的荣誉，而只是给社会作了某些贡献，别人也并不知道有自己这样一个人，那自己就不愿意去作了。这是什么思想呢？只想“闻名于世”，不能“默默无闻”。这样怎么能很好地为人民服务呢？祖国需要的是无数的无名英雄！我们不要总以为自己特殊，就必须搞特殊的工作。共产党员是特殊的人，可是他们什么工作都做：低的干，高的干，没有人干的自己就去干。每一个人都应该有这种精神，去做别人不愿意做的工作。
    我们又问：“有些同学觉得师范是国家需要的，可是搞尖端也是国家需要的呀，那有什么错呢？”
    徐老说：“当然，我们各项事业都需要人来作，尖端科学对我们国家也是非常重要的，但是，我们的尖端科学也要有发达的文化教育事业作基础。我们祖国的各项事业都需要无数的人来完成。这里面我们不要总以为自己特殊，就必须搞特殊的工作。共产党员是特殊的人，可是他们什么工作都做：低的干，高的干，没有人干的自己就去干。共产党员总是到最困难的地方去，我们每个人都应该有这种精神，应该有集体的事业心，而不是个人名利心，所以我们就应该去作别人不愿意做的工作。现在祖国的教育事业需要很多人，这就需要很多有志气、有抱负的青年走上这个岗位。你们能决定搞这个工作，很好，希望你们不要辜负党和人民的培养，作一名优秀的人民教师。”徐老最后还拍着我们的肩膀亲切地说：“我非常高兴你们都作我的同行。”他又说：“可要注意身体啊！作教师也需有适当的运动和休息，身体坏了可是国家的损失。”望着和蔼可亲的徐老，我们真有说不出来的激动。
    是的，我们都是共青团员，是在党的抚育下成长起来的。党对我们寄予很大的希望，要求我们继承前辈的事业。但是，我们过去还总想挑挑拣拣的，想考师范，又舍不得扔下尖端。最初我们考虑自己条件时总是只强调上科技，航院……是合适的，就没有很好考虑考师范也很合适。考师范不也是祖国需要的吗？而自己又有一定的条件，为什么不报考师范呢？听了徐老的话，使我们更懂得了自己应该怎样对待党和国家的需要。我们觉得过去自己为国家想得是太少了，更觉得我们选择了教师这个职业是很对的。我们决心使自己成为优秀的人民教师，把自己的一生献给祖国的教育事业！
