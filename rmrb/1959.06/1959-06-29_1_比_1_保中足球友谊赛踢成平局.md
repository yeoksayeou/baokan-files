Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: Our reporter Wang Yuanjing reports: 1-1 – This was the result of the fierce 90-minute match between the Bulgarian National Football Team's second team and the Beijing Football Team in their first friendly visit to China today, ending in a draw.

This was an absorbing football match. The visiting team, with its rapid passing, scored within a minute of the start, while the Beijing team didn't equalize until the last nine minutes of the game.

After the visiting team kicked off from the center line, they immediately launched a surprising "lightning" fast attack. The tallest player, center forward Yordanov, received the ball on the left side of the Beijing team's end line and immediately made a long pass to the center. Right winger Sochirov took advantage of the situation and powerfully headed the ball towards the goal. The ball came so suddenly that Beijing's goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu didn't have time to make a save, and the ball went into the net. Thunderous applause immediately erupted from the stands.

After conceding the goal, the Beijing team tried hard to counterattack, but the players seemed somewhat flustered, and their ball control and passing repeatedly lacked accuracy. In particular, the forwards passed the ball too slowly, so the attacks often fizzled out halfway. The initiative on the field was increasingly clearly in the hands of the visiting team.

After scoring the first goal, the visiting team strengthened their defense. At times, even the two inside forwards retreated to the center line, forming lines of defense with the two halfbacks and three fullbacks. At the same time, the most active center forward Yordanov and right winger Sochirov shuttled back and forth near the Beijing team's penalty area, organizing attacks and threatening the Beijing team's goal. In the 18th minute, the visiting team's right inside forward Kaladzheriev took a cold shot from more than 20 meters away, which made the audience nervous again. Zhang Junxiu dived twice to save the dangerous shot.

After the second half started, the Beijing team's morale was greatly boosted. They repeatedly used fast passing and powerful shots, keeping the visiting team's goalkeeper Valchanov busy. Valchanov performed very well today, especially after half an hour into the second half, he accurately caught the "twelve-yard" penalty kick taken by Beijing's right halfback Zhang Jingtian, which was greatly praised by the audience.

The Beijing team's offensive became increasingly fierce, and shouts encouraging them were repeatedly heard from the stands. Their offensive proved effective in the 36th minute of the second half. The throw-in by right fullback Sun Yuming was passed twice by Zhang Honggen and Sun Fucheng, and then fell to the feet of center forward Nian Weisi, who took a powerful shot, causing Valchanov's goal to be breached for the first time. The audience cheered.

The match continued, but neither side could score again until the end. The match ended, and nearly 30,000 spectators who had watched the match in the hot sun once again gave warm applause to thank both sides for their wonderful performance.

    1比1——保中足球友谊赛踢成平局
    据新华社28日讯　本社记者王元敬报道：一比一——这是保加利亚国家足球队第二队今天在北京作访华第一次友谊比赛时，同北京足球队激战九十分钟后所形成的不分胜负的战果。
    这是一场引人入胜的足球赛，传球快速的客队上场不到一分钟，就获得一分，而北京队直到全场比赛还剩最后九分钟的时候，才同客队扳成平局。
    客队中线开球后，立即出其不意地来了个“闪电”式快攻。身材最高的队员、中锋约尔丹诺夫在北京队端线左方得球后，马上长传中路，右边锋索契罗夫顺势用力把球顶向球门，这个球来得是那样突然，以致于北京队守门员张俊秀还没来得及扑救，球已入网，看台上随即响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    失球后，北京队虽然努力反攻，但队员显得有些慌乱，停球、传球屡屡失去了准确性，特别是前锋传球过慢，以致攻势常常半途而废。场上的主动权越来越明显地掌握在客队手中。
    客队先得一分以后，一方面加强防守，有时甚至两个内锋也常常退回中线，同两个前卫和三个后卫，组成一道道的防线；另一方面由最活跃的中锋约尔丹诺夫和右边锋索契罗夫，在北京队禁区附近左右穿梭，组织进攻，威胁北京队的球门。第十八分钟时，客队右内锋卡拉杰里耶夫在二十多公尺外的一记冷射，又使观众心情紧张起来，张俊秀连扑了两次才把这个险球扑住。
    第二场比赛开始后，北京队士气大振，多次利用快速传递和强劲的射门，使客队守门员瓦尔昌诺夫应接不暇。瓦尔昌诺夫今天表现非常出色，特别是下半场比赛过了半小时的光景，他竟把北京队右前卫张京天主罚的“十二码”球准确地抱在怀中，使观众大为称赞。
    北京队攻势越来越猛，从看台上多次传出了鼓舞他们的呼声。他们的攻势在下半场第三十六分钟时，获得了成效。右后卫孙玉明发的界外球，经过张宏根、孙福成两次传递，就落到中锋年维泗的脚下，他举足猛射，使瓦尔昌诺夫的球门第一次失守，观众欢腾不已。
    比赛还在继续，但直到终场谁都不能再次得分。比赛结束了，在烈日下观看比赛的近三万名观众再一次响起了感谢双方精彩表演的热烈掌声。
