Curing Reservoirs of "Water Bloat"
Southeast Shanxi Mobilizes 100,000 to Repair Canals and Expand Irrigation Area

(Reported by this newspaper) Shanxi's Southeast Jin Special District is taking advantage of the time after spring sowing to organize more than 100,000 farmers to "diagnose and treat" the "water bloat" of reservoirs.

Over the past three years, the special district's water conservancy and irrigation projects have increased significantly, irrigating 5 million mu of farmland. Many water conservancy projects have played a significant role in flood prevention, summer irrigation, and this year's spring wheat irrigation. However, some projects, due to late starts last year and time constraints, did not complete their finishing touches. Among the more than 1,000 completed medium and small-sized reservoir projects in the district, 18 medium-sized projects such as Jianghe and more than 500 small-sized reservoir projects suffer from "water bloat" (i.e., reservoirs store a lot of water but cannot be used to irrigate farmland) for the above reasons, preventing 1.3 million mu of irrigable cultivated land from benefiting. This not only hinders the full utilization of water storage but also poses a risk of flooding during the flood season due to increased water volume. In order to treat this "water bloat" and fully leverage the irrigation function of reservoir water storage, the CPC Southeast Jin District Committee, in addition to forming a professional team of more than 40,000 people to continue fixed construction, also mobilized 100,000 people to carry out the work of repairing canals and leveling cultivated land. Jincheng County has already repaired 75 reservoirs and 80 canals, enabling 146,000 mu of cultivated land to be irrigated. In the process of "treating" the "water bloat" of reservoirs such as Shencun, Jianghe, and Guancun, the CPC Changzhi Municipal Committee sent the municipal party secretary to strengthen leadership.

Currently, the entire district has completed more than 450 main and branch canals, enabling 121 reservoirs suffering from "water bloat" to supply water and irrigate 450,000 mu of cultivated land.

### 给水库治“水鼓病”  晋东南十万人整修渠道扩大灌溉面积

    给水库治“水鼓病”
    晋东南十万人整修渠道扩大灌溉面积
    本报讯　山西晋东南专区利用春播结束的空隙时间，正在组织十万多农民“诊治”水库的“水鼓病”。
    全专区的水利灌溉工程，最近三年来增加很多，可灌溉农田五百万亩。许多水利工程在过去防洪、夏浇和今年春浇小麦中发挥了巨大作用。但是，有一部分工程因为去年开工较晚，时间紧迫，收尾工程没有完结。全区已修成的一千余座中小型水库工程中，就有绛河等十八项中型和五百多个小型水库工程因以上原因，患着“水鼓病”（即水库蓄水很多，而不能引用灌溉农田），使一百三十万亩可以灌溉的耕地不能受益。这样不仅妨害蓄水的充分利用，而且汛期到来以后，还有水量增大发生泛滥成灾的危险。为了诊治这种“水鼓病”，充分发挥水库蓄水的灌溉作用，中共晋东南地委除了组成四万余人的专业队伍继续固定施工以外，又发动了十万人展开了整修渠道、平整耕地的工作。晋城县已经修整了七十五个水库、八十条渠，使十四万六千亩耕地得到灌溉。中共长治市委在“治疗”申村、绛河、关村等水库的“水鼓病”当中，派出市委书记加强领导。
    目前，全区已经完成主要干、支渠四百五十多条，使一百二十一个患有“水鼓病”的水库，通水灌浇了四十五万亩耕地。
