Xinhua News Agency, 12th: In recent days, the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the capital, Hebei, Shandong, and other places have completely stopped their training and are fully engaged in the battle to seize the wheat harvest. Thousands of soldiers and officers wield scythes day and night in the wheat fields, driving carts and horses to help farmers rush to harvest.

In the capital, nearly 10,000 soldiers have participated in the rush harvest every day for the past three days. At 2:00 AM on the 9th, a wheat harvesting expedition team of more than 3,000 people, jointly composed of armored兵, signal兵, and the Capital Garrison Force, set off mightily for Tongzhou District to start harvesting wheat in the famous "Golden Wheat Ear" producing area. Senior Colonel Wang Guangde and others led an armored force that harvested 250 mu of wheat in one day. Generals Yang Yong and Lai Chuanzhu led more than 300 officers who harvested 90 mu of wheat in half a day. The wheat harvesting army of the Air Force Direct Detachment set off in four directions, east, west, north, and south, on the 11th, heading to Changping, Haidian, Tongzhou, Nanyuan and other places, and together with the members of the local people's communes, they advanced side by side in the wheat fields. The trucks they brought were also continuously loading the harvested wheat and transporting it back to the communes.

In Shandong, the wheat harvesting teams of the troops stationed in various places have been dispatched since the end of May and have not yet withdrawn. As of the 8th, the troops stationed in Jinan City had completed more than 18,000 workdays and harvested more than 7,500 mu of wheat. On the morning of the 7th, the radio station forecast strong winds and rain for the day. Lieutenant General Liang Biye, Major General He Zhucheng, and others immediately led their troops to the eastern suburbs of Licheng County to brave the rain and rush to harvest wheat. A certain military school mobilized all its personnel during the day to rush to harvest wheat, and in the evening, it allocated manpower to help the commune thresh and beat the wheat. The navy stationed in Qingdao fought alongside the commune members in twelve people's communes near the驻地, braving the rain, and worked to harvest, transport, and thresh simultaneously.

The students of an air force school stationed in a certain place in Hebei fought for four days until they had finished harvesting and threshing the wheat for the commune members in the驻地 before returning to school.

In the process of harvesting wheat, all the troops ensured careful harvesting and threshing. Many troops also organized inspection teams, harvesting in the front and picking up in the back, leaving no grain behind. The masses in various places expressed their deep gratitude for the strong assistance of the troops, and came to offer condolences with baskets and jars. A快板 circulated in a certain place in Hebei praised the Liberation Army, saying: When commune members see the Liberation Army, everyone smiles and expresses their heartfelt thanks. You planted wheat last year, and you are helping with the wheat harvest this summer. We sow and harvest together, and the granaries are full. The friendship between the army and the people is as inseparable as fish and water.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 13th: The people of various cities in Shaanxi are enthusiastically supporting the summer harvest of farmers. According to statistics from nineteen cities in the Guanzhong area alone, these cities mobilize a total of more than 610,000 people every day to support the summer harvest.

Xi'an City has 200,000 people every day, including cadres from government offices, teachers and students from schools, soldiers from the army, workers, and residents, who bring their own harvesting and transportation tools to participate in the summer harvest battle in the suburbs and the four counties under the city's jurisdiction. Among them, there are more than 72,000 teachers and students from schools. Most of the teachers and students from Jiaotong University (Xi'an part), Northwest University, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an Normal College, Xi'an Medical College, and other schools brought their own luggage and tools and went to various communes in the suburbs to help harvest wheat. Factory workers throughout the city also dispatched more than 69,000 people to support the summer harvest of farmers in the suburbs without affecting production. In addition to the 300 people who regularly support the summer harvest, the workers who persisted in production at the No. 3 State Cotton Factory also participated in the wheat harvest in nearby communes during the holidays. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Xi'an purchased scythes and prepared four rubber-tired carts to support the summer harvest in Lintong, the farthest from the urban area. The summer harvest support team of more than 33,800 people in Baoji City all arrived in the countryside on the 8th. More than 6,200 residents carried their own bedding, prepared scythes, and signed up to help farmers in the suburbs rush to harvest wheat. Tibetan students from the Xizang Public School in Xianyang City also actively participated in the summer harvest work in the suburbs with the city's summer harvest support team.

Personnel supporting the summer harvest in various places eat, live, and work with the farmers. When the teachers and students of Xi'an Railway Institute supported the summer harvest in Yujin People's Commune, Lintong County, because they arrived early and the wheat there had not yet ripened, the female students helped the commune members dismantle and wash quilts, and the male students cleaned the environment. Li Xun, a doctor from the Women and Children Health Center of Beilin District, Xi'an City, supported the wheat harvesting in Dongdeng Village, Huaxu People's Commune, Lantian County. Knowing that there was measles in the area, she took the initiative to treat the children during her lunch or evening breaks.

Various places have also mobilized a large number of transportation forces to support the summer harvest. Baoji City alone dispatched 600 pushcarts, 306 rubber-tired carts, and 40 cars to support the summer harvest in the suburbs. Xi'an City has more than 700 cars, rubber-tired carts, and pushcarts every day to help farmers in the suburbs transport wheat. (Attached picture)

    大家动手 下乡收麦
    驻首都河北山东部队全体官兵投入夺麦大战
    关中十九个城市每天出动六十多万人支援夏收
    新华社12日讯　这几天，驻首都、河北、山东等地的中国人民解放军，全部停止操课，全力投入夺麦大战。成千上万的官兵在麦田里，日夜挥动镰刀，驱驰车马，帮助农民抢收。
    在首都，最近三天每天有近万名官兵参加抢收。9日凌晨二时，一支由装甲兵、通信兵、首都卫戍部队等联合组成的三千多人的麦收远征队，浩浩荡荡开赴通州区，在著名的“金麦穗”的产区，开镰割麦。王广德上校等率领的装甲兵部队一天割麦二百五十亩。杨勇上将和赖传珠上将率领的三百多名军官半天割麦九十亩。空军直属队的割麦大军，11日分东西南北四路，开赴昌平、海淀、通州、南苑等地和当地人民公社社员一起，在麦田里齐头并进，他们带来的汽车，也一刻不停地装着收割的小麦运回公社。
    在山东，各地驻军割麦队伍，从5月下旬起出动以来，到现在还未收兵。驻济南市的部队到8日为止，已做了一万八千多个劳动日，割麦七千五百多亩。7日早晨，广播电台预报当日有大风雨，梁必业中将、何柱成少将等立即率领部队到历城县东郊冒雨抢麦。某军事学校白天一齐出动抢收小麦，晚上又抽出人力帮助公社脱粒打麦。驻青岛的海军，在驻地附近十二个人民公社里和社员一起冒雨奋战，并且作到边割、边运、边打。
    驻河北某地的空军学校的学员，奋战四天，直到把驻地社员的小麦割完打净才回校。
    在割麦过程中，各部队都做到了精收细打。许多部队还组织了检查队，前面割，后面捡，颗粒不丢。各地群众对部队的大力援助，深表感激，纷纷提篮携罐前来慰问。河北某地流传一段盛赞解放军的快板说：社员见到解放军，人人笑颜述衷心，去年小麦你们种，今夏麦收你帮忙，共播共收粮满仓，鱼水难分军民友谊长。
    新华社西安13日电　陕西各城市人民热烈支援农民夏收。仅据关中地区十九个城市的统计，这些城市每天出动支援夏收工作的人数共有六十一万多人。
    西安市每天有机关干部、学校师生、部队官兵、职工、居民等二十万人，自带收割、运输工具，参加郊区和市属四个县的夏收战斗。其中学校师生就有七万二千多人。交通大学（西安部分）、西北大学、西北工业大学、西安师范学院、西安医学院等校，大部分师生都自带行李和工具，分赴郊区各公社帮助收割小麦。全市工厂职工在不影响生产的情况下，也抽调了六万九千多人支援郊区农民夏收。国棉三厂除了经常有三百人支援夏收以外，坚持生产的职工也利用假日参加附近公社的麦收工作。人民解放军驻西安的部队自购镰刀，并准备了四辆胶轮马车，到离市区最远的临潼去支援夏收。宝鸡市由三万三千八百多人组成的支援夏收队伍，8日全部到达农村。有六千二百多个居民自己背着铺盖，自备镰刀，报名到郊区帮助农民抢收小麦。咸阳市西藏公学的藏族学员，也随着全市支援夏收队伍，积极参加了郊区的夏收工作。
    各地支援夏收的人员都和农民同吃同住同劳动。西安铁道学院师生支援临潼县雨金人民公社夏收时，因为去得早，那里的麦子还没有成熟，女学生就帮助社员拆洗被子，男学生打扫环境卫生。西安市碑林区妇幼保健所医生李巽支援蓝田县华胥人民公社东邓村割麦时，知道当地有麻疹病，她便利用中午或晚上休息时间主动为孩子治病。
    各地还动员了大批运输力量支援夏收。仅宝鸡市就出动六百辆架子车，三百零六辆胶轮大车，四十辆汽车支援郊区的夏收。西安市每天有七百多辆汽车、胶轮大车和架子车帮助郊区农民运麦。（附图片）
