Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 21st. The 73-year-old Peking Opera performing artist Gai Jiaotian gave a very lively performance art lesson to students at the Shanghai Opera School on the 18th.

Gai Jiaotian, known as the "Living Wu Song," walked with Wu Song's staggering steps, seemingly drunk but not quite, wanting to vomit but holding it back. He said that some people portray Wu Song entering the stage with drunken steps, immediately striking a majestic pose, showing no sign of drunkenness at all, which is illogical. Others portray Wu Song as a drunkard, even making vomiting gestures, which is not beautiful. The play must be performed just right, both showing Wu Song's drunkenness and not losing his heroic spirit.

Regarding the plot where Wu Song suddenly sees a tiger while drunk, Gai Jiaotian carefully analyzed Wu Song's expression at the time: he was not afraid of the tiger, but he felt a little chilled inside. He said that if Wu Song were portrayed as having no fear at all, glaring angrily, that would not be realistic.

Wu Song swung his big club and fought the tiger. From maneuvering to capturing the tiger, Gai Jiaotian used a series of graceful movements. This is the culmination of his decades of refinement from life. He said that an actor's every step, every line, every sitting and standing posture, every turn, and every raise of a leg must have a pose and a purpose.

The old artist's method of teaching art and lecturing has attracted the attention of the Shanghai theater community.

    盖叫天传艺讲学
    据新华社上海21日电　七十三岁的京剧表演艺术家盖叫天，18日在上海市戏曲学校为学生们上了一堂极其生动的表演艺术课。
    被誉为“活武松”的盖叫天，一面走着武松的踉跄的步子，似醉非醉，想吐又被压住了。他说，有人演武松一出场是醉步，马上一个亮相很威武，一点也没有醉态，这不合情理；也有人把武松演成个酒鬼，并做出呕吐动作，这就不美，戏要演得恰到好处，既表演武松的醉态，又要不失英雄气概。
    对武松醉中忽见猛虎的一段情节，盖叫天仔细分析了当时武松的神情：他不怕虎，心里却有些寒。他说，如果把武松演成毫无惧色，怒目而视，那就不真实了。
    武松抡起大棍和老虎搏斗，从周旋到擒虎，盖叫天运用一连串优美的身段。这是他几十年来从生活中提炼出来的结晶。他说演员的一步一行，一坐一站，一转身一抬腿都得有姿势，有目的性。
    老艺人传艺讲学的方法，已引起上海戏剧界的重视。
