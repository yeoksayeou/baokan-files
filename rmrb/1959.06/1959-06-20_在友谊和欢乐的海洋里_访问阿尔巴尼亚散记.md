In Albania, the heart is always warm. I want to write something, but my writing is hard-pressed to express my feelings.

The Albanian people are warm and hospitable.

When we—the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation—arrived in Albania, the Soviet Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Khrushchev was visiting there, and German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl was also vacationing there. The delegation led by Korean Chairman Choi Yong-kun was also about to arrive. To welcome guests from fraternal countries, the entire Albania was as lively as if celebrating a festival or a wedding. From Tirana to all the towns and cities, large and small, throughout Albania, the flags of Albania, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries fluttered everywhere. Portraits of Comrades Hoxha, Khrushchev, and Mao Zedong appeared in various places. The Albanian hillsides near roads and villages were also decorated with slogans made of grass and flowers such as "Eternal Friendship between the People of the Soviet Union, China, and Albania" and "Friendship is the Guarantee." These days, as soon as a beautiful car appeared on the streets or roads, people would swarm around it. When they recognized it was "Kines" (Chinese) or "Roski" (Russian), they would enthusiastically cheer. Sometimes this obstructive welcome would develop into mass rallies until the car disappeared. In those unforgettable days, the whole of Albania was in revelry.

Albania is one of the smaller countries in our socialist camp. But in Albania, you never get the feeling that the population is small. On the contrary, you are met with crowds of people everywhere. In Tirana, we participated in a mass rally of 100,000 people, which meant that everyone in Tirana who could walk came. People were there to listen to Comrade Khrushchev's long speech and to see Soviet Marshal Malinovsky and Chinese Marshal Peng Dehuai. Because there were so many people and the podium was far away, it was difficult to hear clearly and see clearly, but no one was willing to leave the venue. As soon as someone started speaking, there was cheering and applause from below. When the Soviet and Chinese delegations left the venue, layers of people formed a long corridor, allowing us to pass through the forest of arms and cheers. When we went to Shkodër, a famous city in northern Albania, it was raining heavily, but people along the way braved the rain to welcome us. Upon entering the city of Shkodër, there were crowds of people welcoming us on both sides of the road. Then everyone rushed to the central square, and a grand welcome meeting began again.

Enthusiasm, hospitality, and thoughtfulness are indeed the characteristics of Albanian comrades. Before we arrived, Albanian Defense Minister General Balluku personally went to the "Dajti" Hotel to arrange our meals. He specially transferred a chef who could cook Chinese food for us and specifically instructed them to cook chili peppers for us. Knowing that we were not used to drinking cold boiled water, he also put thermos bottles and Longjing tea in our rooms. Albania has a custom like Bulgaria, that "nodding means no and shaking means yes." Nodding means negation, and shaking means affirmation. But they learned about Chinese customs in advance and handled everything according to Chinese habits. This led to many jokes. When eating in Albania, because there was too much food, we really couldn't finish it all. According to Albanian customs, we had to nod our heads to indicate that we didn't want it. But as soon as you nodded, the Albanian comrades would come to add more food. Nodding didn't work, so we had to shake our heads. Once we shook our heads, even more food was brought up. We encountered this situation many times. The Minister of Health of the Albanian People's Army, a famous medical expert, lived with us during our visit. He often said to us: "If you lose weight, I will be fully responsible." He cared for and looked after us like a nanny.

During the few days of our visit to Albania, we felt as if we were living in our own home, without feeling constrained or estranged at all. Our Marshal Peng Dehuai was not used to inspecting honor guards everywhere, so Minister Balluku ordered them to be removed or reduced. We suggested holding fewer mass welcome rallies to avoid affecting mass production, and the Albanian comrades quickly accepted it. We felt that there was too much food and that the meals took too long, and Minister Balluku completely agreed. He also said: "During the war, everything was very simple, and meals were solved in three minutes. Now that we have won, it is indeed a waste of too much time!" Therefore, he personally made arrangements with the chef. Here, we felt that even though the language was different, it didn't seem to be a big problem. At banquets and during visits, we had interesting conversations with each other using broken Russian, Chinese, and Albanian. Sometimes we simply didn't speak, just gesturing. A pat on the shoulder and the meaning was understood. General Xiao Hua had visited Albania ten years ago, and the comrades here called him the first Chinese to visit Albania. Some Albanian comrades even affectionately called out his name, embraced and kissed him, drank toasts with him, and pulled him into collective dances. The Albanian comrades said that he looked even younger than he did ten years ago.

Naturally, people living in such pleasant circumstances will feel young. During our visit to Albania, we met the comrades of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation several times, twice at banquets. Once was on the evening of May 29, when we were invited to the Partisan Palace to attend a banquet hosted by the Soviet Ambassador to welcome Comrade Khrushchev and others, and the other was a reception hosted by the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Council of Ministers. Comrade Khrushchev always greeted Marshal Peng Dehuai first with his hands clasped together, and when Marshal Peng Dehuai took his seat, he always let Marshal Malinovsky take his seat first. They talked cordially like old friends. On such occasions, people would surround the Soviet and Chinese comrades in groups, talking from Berlin to the Balkans, from the Mediterranean to the Pacific. Here, everyone is clear that Albania is not isolated. It is a member of our socialist family, and the era when imperialism could bully Albania is gone forever. People drank Moutai, vodka, and red wine, and it was truly a case of a thousand cups being too few when kindred spirits meet! Toasts, conversations, very congenial. The banquet naturally turned into a gala. This kind of gala is the most cordial and the most lively. When the band played Albanian partisan songs and other folk music, the Albanian party and government leaders Comrades Hoxha, Shehu, Kabo, Lleshi, Balluku and other generals and ministers took the lead and danced and sang. Often, the leader would wave a small handkerchief, dancing a variety of folk dances, and the others would closely follow him in collective dances. Envoys from various fraternal countries also followed suit and joined in the fun. At the party in the "Dajti" Hotel, people danced with increasing enthusiasm. Finally, everyone looked at Comrade Khrushchev and Marshal Peng Dehuai on the podium, and the applause seemed to urge them to come down. I have never seen our Marshal Peng Dehuai dance, and as far as I know, he doesn't like dancing very much. But in such an atmosphere full of youthful vitality, what could he do? Marshal Peng Dehuai clapped his hands lightly while looking up at the ceiling. At this time, Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Hoxha walked over, and the two of them grabbed him and entered the dance circle together. The hall was filled with thunderous applause and loud music. Comrade Khrushchev, Comrade Hoxha, Marshal Peng Dehuai, and many old Albanian guerrillas who attended the banquet were all together, happily dancing the Albanian guerrilla dance. The "Dajti" Hotel was filled with friendship and youthful joy. These revolutionary predecessors, in today's increasingly prosperous and strong socialist era, certainly seem younger!

    在友谊和欢乐的海洋里
    ——访问阿尔巴尼亚散记
    冯征
    在阿尔巴尼亚，心里总是热烘烘的。想写点什么，可是文笔又很难表达心意。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民，是热情的好客的人民。
    我们——中国军事友好代表团到达阿尔巴尼亚的时候，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团正在那里访问，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥同志也在那里度假，朝鲜崔庸健委员长率领的代表团也将到这里来。为了迎接来自兄弟之邦的客人们，整个阿尔巴尼亚像过节日、办喜事一样，十分热闹。从地拉那到阿尔巴尼亚全国各个大小市镇，到处都飘扬着阿尔巴尼亚、苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的国旗，霍查同志、赫鲁晓夫同志和毛泽东同志的肖像出现在各个场所。靠近道路和村落的阿尔巴尼亚的山坡上，也被装饰起
  “苏联、中国、阿尔巴尼亚人民永远友好”、“友谊是保证”等用青草和鲜花缀成的标语。这些天，只要街头上、道路上一出现了漂亮的小汽车，人们就会蜂拥而来。当他们辨清是“基乃斯”（中国人）或者是“罗斯基”（俄罗斯人）之后，就会热情地欢呼起来，有时这种拦阻的欢迎，会发展为群众大会，直到汽车消失为止。在那些难忘的日子里，整个阿尔巴尼亚都在狂欢之中。
    阿尔巴尼亚是我们社会主义阵营国家中人口较少的国家之一。但是在阿尔巴尼亚，你根本不会有人口少的感觉。相反地，你碰到的到处是人山人海。在地拉那我们参加了一个十万人的群众大会，这就是说所有地拉那人，只要是能走路的全部都来了。人们在这里要听取赫鲁晓夫同志的长篇演说，要看看苏联的马利诺夫斯基元帅和中国的彭德怀元帅。由于人太多，主席台离得又远，听不清楚也看不清，但是谁也不肯离开会场。只要一听有人讲话，台下就是一片欢呼，一阵掌声。当苏联和中国的代表团离开会场的时候，层层的人群排成了一条长长的胡同，让我们从森林般的手臂和欢呼声中穿过去。我们去阿尔巴尼亚北部名城斯库台的时候，正好天下大雨，沿途的人们都冒着雨来欢迎我们。一进入斯库台市，全是夹道欢迎的人群。接着大家就涌向市中心广场，盛大的欢迎会又开始了。
    热情、好客、而且体贴入微，确是阿尔巴尼亚同志们的特色。在我们未到之前，阿尔巴尼亚国防部长巴卢库上将就亲自到“达伊特”大饭店为我们布置膳食，他特意为我们调来会做中国饭的厨师，并且特别嘱咐为我们烧辣椒。知道我们不习惯吃凉开水，还在我们的房间里放了暖水瓶和龙井茶。阿尔巴尼亚有一种风俗和保加利亚一样，就是“点头不算摇头算”。点头是否定，摇头是肯定。但他们事先了解了中国的习惯，一切按中国的习惯办事。这一来，笑话就多了。在阿尔巴尼亚用饭时，由于饭菜太多，我们实在无法全部用完。按照阿尔巴尼亚的习惯，我们只好头点，表示不要。可是你一点头，阿尔巴尼亚同志就来添菜饭。点头不灵，就只好摇头。一摇头不得了啦，更多的菜饭都拿上来了。这种情况我们碰到好多次。阿尔巴尼亚人民军的卫生部长，一位著名的医务专家，在我们访问期间和我们一起生活，他常对我们说：“你们如果减轻了体重，那我要负完全责任。”他简直像保姆一样地关心和照顾我们。
    在阿尔巴尼亚访问的几天中，像生活在自己家里一样，一点也不感觉拘束和生疏。我们的彭德怀元帅不习惯到处检阅仪仗队，巴卢库部长就下令去掉或减少。我们建议少开群众性的欢迎大会，以免影响群众生产，阿尔巴尼亚同志们很快就接受了。我们感觉饭菜太多，吃饭时间过长，巴卢库部长完全同意，他也说：“战争时期一切都很简便，吃饭三分钟解决问题，现在胜利了，的确浪费时间太多了！”因此，他亲自向厨师作了交代。在这里，我们感觉语言不同，似乎困难不大。在宴会上，在访问中，彼此用不通半通的俄文、中文和阿尔巴尼亚文有趣地交谈着，有时干脆不讲话，只是打打手势。拍拍肩膀，意思也就了解了，萧华上将十年前曾经来阿尔巴尼亚访问过，这里的同志都称他是第一个访问阿尔巴尼亚的中国人。阿尔巴尼亚有些同志们索性就亲热地叫起他的名字，和他拥抱接吻，喝交怀酒，拉他跳集体舞。阿尔巴尼亚的同志们说他比十年前看来更加年青了。
    自然，处在这样愉快的生活中间的人们，都会感到年轻的。在访问阿尔巴尼亚期间，我们有几次和苏联党政代表团的同志们相会，有两次是在宴会上。一次是5月29日夜晚，我们应邀去游击队宫参加苏联大使为欢迎赫鲁晓夫等同志的宴会，一次是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议的招待会。赫鲁晓夫同志每次都是双手合十地抢先和彭德怀元帅打招呼，彭德怀元帅入座的时候，也总是先让马利诺夫斯基元帅入座。他们像老朋友一样，亲切地谈话。这种场合，人们就一团团地把苏联同志和中国同志包围起来，从柏林谈到巴尔干，从地中海谈到太平洋。在这里人们都清楚，阿尔巴尼亚不是孤立的。她是我们社会主义大家庭的一员，帝国主义想欺负阿尔巴尼亚的时代是一去不复返了。人们喝着茅台、伏特加和红葡萄，真是酒逢知己千杯少！干杯、交谈，十分投机。宴会自然而然地变成了联欢晚会。这种联欢晚会是最亲切的，也是最热闹的。当乐队奏起阿尔巴尼亚的游击队歌及其他民间乐曲的时候，阿尔巴尼亚的党政领导人霍查、谢胡、卡博、列希、巴卢库等同志和其他将军们、部长们，都率先下场，且歌且舞。往往是为首的一个扬着小手巾，跳着花样翻新的土风舞，其余的人紧跟着他跳集体舞。各兄弟国家的使节们也都跟着下场，共同欢乐。在“达伊特”大饭店的晚会中，人们跳得兴致越来越浓，最后，大家都望着主席台上的赫鲁晓夫同志和彭德怀元帅，掌声一遍又一遍地好像要催他们下场。我没有看到过我们的彭德怀元帅跳舞，据我所知他也不大喜欢跳舞。但是，在这样充满青春活力的气氛中，怎么办呢？彭德怀元帅一边轻轻地鼓着掌，一边仰着头看天花板。这时候赫鲁晓夫同志和霍查同志走了过来，两个人紧拉住他，一起进入了舞圈，大厅里掌声雷动，乐音嘹喨。赫鲁晓夫同志、霍查同志和彭德怀元帅以及参加宴会的许多阿尔巴尼亚老游击队员们都在一起，快乐地跳着阿尔巴尼亚的游击队舞。“达伊特”大饭店洋溢着友谊和青春的欢乐。这些革命的前辈，在社会主义日益繁荣昌盛的今天，看来确实都年轻了！
