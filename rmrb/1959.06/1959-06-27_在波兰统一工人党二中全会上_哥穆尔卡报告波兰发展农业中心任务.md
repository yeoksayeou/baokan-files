Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 25th - According to the Polish News Agency, at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party held on the 22nd, Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a report on the central tasks of Polish agricultural development for 1959-1965.

In his report, Gomułka stated that this Central Committee plenary session would study the issue of agricultural development. The Party's Third Congress formulated the general tasks in this regard and stipulated in the directives for the development of the national economy in 1959-1965 that by 1965, the total output value of agricultural products should increase by 30% compared to 1958. He pointed out that such an increase in agricultural products is of great significance for realizing other indicators of Polish economic development in the next seven years and will be decisive for increasing the real wages and incomes of the agricultural population as stipulated in the directives. Therefore, when the Party acts in accordance with the agricultural policy formulated by the Congress, it should take corresponding measures to create favorable conditions for solving this task.

Gomułka said that the Political Bureau of the United Workers' Party and the Presidium of the Central Committee of the United Peasant Party had discussed this issue in great detail. After consultation, we unanimously concluded that the prescribed measures should be expressed in a consistent resolution, which will be adopted simultaneously by the plenary session of our Party's Central Committee and the plenary session of the United Peasant Party's Central Committee.

Next, Gomułka compared the planned consumption indicators of major food products per capita in 1965 with those in 1958. He pointed out that meat consumption would increase from 40 kg in 1958 to 49 kg in 1965, lard from 8.1 kg to 9.6 kg, milk and dairy products (converted to milk) from 354.4 liters to 420 liters, sugar from 28.8 kg to 34 kg, and grain consumption (converted to flour) would decrease from 144.5 kg to 134.8 kg, a decrease of 6.7%. The decrease in grain consumption is due to changes in the consumption structure, leading to a decrease in the demand for grain products.

Gomułka pointed out that since the founding of People's Poland, there has been a significant increase in consumption. In 1958, per capita consumption of oils and fats increased by 145.5%, sugar by 200%, and milk and dairy products by 35.1%. These growth figures demonstrate the essence of our socialist construction.

When discussing the import and export of agricultural products, Gomułka pointed out that the policy of importing grain and exporting meat is beneficial to our national economy. Under the condition of importing grain raw materials, exporting meat and meat products at current prices is more profitable than the average profit of all our exports.

Then, Gomułka talked about the situation of Polish agriculture and drew attention to the slow growth rate of agricultural products. He pointed out that if the value of agricultural products harvested per 100 hectares of agricultural land has increased by 34.4% compared to the pre-war period, then the value of livestock products per 100 hectares of agricultural land has increased by 77.7%. To overcome this disconnect that hinders agricultural development, it is necessary to further intensify agriculture, increase the yield per unit area of grain and root crops, improve the composition of the sown area, and develop animal husbandry on this basis.

Gomułka said that the production potential of our agriculture is very large. They even greatly exceed the production targets we plan to achieve in 1965.

Gomułka pointed out that the measures taken by the state have encouraged farmers' initiative and greatly promoted the development of agricultural production. The growth of agricultural production in 1954-1958 was 25%, while the growth of commodity production was about 35%. Rural self-reliance investment in 1957 and 1958 increased by 5.4 billion złotys compared to 1955 and 1956. The artificial fertilizer purchased for the 1959 harvest increased by 30% compared to 1958. The use of improved seeds in 1958 increased by 12% compared to 1956. Rural construction has seen large-scale development.

Gomułka then discussed in detail the issue of investment direction in agriculture. He said that according to the instructions of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, agricultural investment in 1959-1965 should be 130 billion złotys, and it is stipulated that productive investment should be 93 billion złotys. The investment goals that are very important and decisive for the development of agricultural production are:

First, mechanization. In view of this, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party suggested increasing the average indicators in the instructions made by the Third Congress as follows: increase the supply of tractors in 1959-1965 from the originally planned 80,000 units to 112,000 units. The planned increase in tractor equipment will enable agriculture to mechanize about one-third of the main field work by 1965.

Second, it is recommended to expand the soil improvement work plan for 1961-1965 and increase the funds allocated for this work to more than 17 billion złotys. This means increasing the investment in this area to three times the investment used for this area in the current five-year plan. As a result of soil improvement, agriculture will be able to obtain about 8 million tons (converted to dry hay) of feed during the period of 1961-1965.

Third, during the seven-year plan, the allocation for rural construction will reach 23.4 billion złotys. During the period of 1961-1965, it is planned to build 1.2 million houses and production buildings in rural areas, with a construction cost of about 40 billion złotys. The private investment and labor provided by rural residents, as well as the creation of conditions for maximizing the reduction of construction costs, are decisive for completing such a large-scale construction and fully utilizing the assistance provided by the state.

Gomułka said that it is necessary to ensure that land-poor farmers and middle peasants can widely apply modern technology. In order to complete the extensive soil improvement plan and correctly use the soil improvement equipment, it is required that farmers use collective strength and accumulate public funds. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a mass, broad, and economic farmers' social organization in rural areas, whose main task is to mobilize farmers to link individual efforts with mutual assistance and cooperation, while relying on public funds and state assistance to expand production and improve production. Agricultural teams should be such organizations. Agricultural teams should control most of the tractors and machines for farmers' use. They should play the role of collective labor organizers in rural areas, and they should play the role of organizers of public means of production. Therefore, agricultural teams should become universal organizations including the vast majority of rural residents, and they should have the necessary financial funds. Agricultural teams should become owners of a large number of agricultural machines. In this way, the social nature of agricultural teams has socialist content. The fact that agricultural teams own machines transforms them into mass, universal socio-economic organizations for all farmers. In order for agricultural teams to become such organizations, they should have the corresponding conditions and possibilities to carry out their activities, and they should have the necessary funds to purchase agricultural machines. This fund should be provided by the state and expanded with rural funds.

Our Party has reached a consensus with the United Peasant Party in carrying out activities. Our Party proceeds from the principle that the expansion of the program of agricultural mechanization and soil improvement requires the state to allocate a sum of money to agricultural teams, which comes from the difference between the farmers' mandatory sales to date and the prices obtained by the state for supplying the free market.

In this way, we have opened a new page in the history of economic and social development in rural areas, which will record the history of agricultural mechanization, collective use of machinery, large-scale soil improvement, and the implementation of farmer autonomy within the new scope of activities of agricultural teams.

Gomułka said that the new proposition to enhance the role and significance of agricultural teams is a constructive development of the Party's Third Congress's resolution on the Party's rural policy. The social essence of this resolution is to comprehensively lead rural areas onto the road of socialist development. Agricultural teams are by no means a factor that opposes production cooperatives. On the contrary, they should be regarded as a school that forms farmers' ideological awareness and practical habits of collective management. In particular, the proposition to implement the mechanization of the agricultural production process will constantly bring farmers closer to the idea of production cooperation.

The Party adheres to the program of socialist transformation of rural areas, and at the same time believes that this transformation can only be completed under the condition of establishing large-scale collective agricultural economies, that is, production cooperatives, but the purpose of this transformation should first be to expand agricultural production. Collective peasant economies can only be established with the consent of the peasants.

Gomułka said that both agricultural teams and agricultural production cooperatives require the Party to concentrate its efforts on developing them. Both the former and the latter serve the cause of socialist transformation of rural areas for further developing agriculture.

Gomułka said that the program of intensive farming in agriculture and transforming the technical foundation of agriculture on the basis of mass socio-economic agricultural organizations—agricultural teams—proposed in the draft resolution faces our Party with many new, broad, and multifaceted tasks. Our Party's ally—the United Peasant Party—also faces these tasks. Because this is a common program. This is a broad basis for expanding and deepening the cooperation between our Party's organizations at all levels and the United Peasant Party's organizations at all levels in rural areas. It is now conditional and necessary to propose the realization of such a slogan: Every member of the Polish United Workers' Party and the United Peasant Party should become an activist in agricultural teams.

Wherever there are Party organizations in rural areas, the Party organizations should advocate the establishment of agricultural teams and promote the existing teams. In rural areas where there are no Party organizations, agricultural teams should be established with the help of specially sent representatives of district and township activists. Without affecting and strengthening the autonomous management of agricultural teams in the slightest, the organizations of the Polish United Workers' Party and the teams of the Polish United Peasant Party should do their best to ensure that conscious land-poor farmers and middle peasants have a decisive say in the leadership of agricultural teams. These people must care about public property and rationally dispose of it. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the Polish United Workers' Party plays a leading role in agricultural teams and gives full play to the autonomy of this organization.

Gomułka finally said that the realization of the program we have formulated not only determines the development of agriculture itself and the transformation of rural areas, but also determines the development of the entire national economy. Therefore, the realization of this program is not only a matter for rural areas, but it should become a matter for the working class, a matter for the cities, and a matter for the whole people.

This program opens up magnificent prospects, creates favorable conditions for the Party's work in rural areas, and points out a path along which we can steadily and on a large scale move towards the goals pointed out by the Third Party Congress—increasing agricultural production and gradually building socialism in rural areas.

    在波兰统一工人党二中全会上
    哥穆尔卡报告波兰发展农业中心任务
    新华社25日讯　据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡在22日举行的波兰统一工人党第二次中央委员会全体会议上作了关于1959—1965年波兰农业发展的中心任务的报告。
    哥穆尔卡在报告中说，这次党的中央全会要研究发展农业的问题。党的第三次代表大会制定了在这方面的总任务，并且在1959—1965年发展国民经济的指示中规定，到1965年，农产品总产值要比1958年增加30％。他指出，农产品获得这样的增长对于在今后七年内实现波兰经济发展的其他指标具有重大意义，对于这项指示中所规定的增加农业人口的实际工资和收入方面将具有决定性的意义。所以党在根据代表大会所制定的农业政策行动时，应当采取相应的措施，为解决这一任务创造良好条件。
    哥穆尔卡说，统一工人党政治局同统一农民党中央委员会主席团十分详细地讨论了这个问题，经过协商以后，我们一致得出结论：在这方面所规定的措施应当表现在一致的决议中，这个决议将由我们党的中央委员会全体会议和统一农民党中央委员会全体会议同时通过。
    接着，哥穆尔卡把计划规定的1965年主要食品产品按人口平均计算的消费指标同1958年的消费指标作了对比。他指出，肉类消费量将从1958年的四十公斤增加到1965年的四十九公斤，猪油从八点一公斤增加到九点六公斤，奶类和奶制品（折合牛奶计算）从三百五十四点四公升增加到四百二十公升，糖从二十八点八公斤增加到三十四公斤，谷物的消费量（折合面粉计算）将从一百四十四点五公斤减少到一百三十四点八公斤，即减少6.7％。谷物消费量的减少，是由于消费结构的改变，引起了对谷物产品需求的减少而形成的。
    哥穆尔卡指出，人民波兰建国以来，消费量方面有了很大的增长。1958年按人口计算的油脂消费量增加了145.5％，糖增加了200％，牛奶和奶制品增加了35.1％。这些增长的数字表明了我国社会主义建设的实质。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到农产品的进出口问题时指出，进口谷物和输出肉类的政策对于我国国民经济是有利的。在进口谷物原料的条件下，按照目前的价格输出肉类和肉类产品的赢利比我们全部输出的平均赢利高。
    然后，哥穆尔卡谈到了波兰农业状况，并且提请注意农产品增长速度比较缓慢这一情况。他指出，如果说，每一百公顷农业用地所收获的农产品的价值比战前增加了34.4％，那么每一百公顷农业用地畜产品的价值增加了77.7％。要克服这种阻碍农业发展的脱节现象，就只有进一步使农业集约化，提高谷物和块根作物的单位面积产量，改善播种面积的构成，并在这个基础上来发展畜牧业。
    哥穆尔卡说，我国农业的生产潜力是很大的。它们甚至大大超过我们预定在1965年达到的生产指标。
    哥穆尔卡指出，国家所采取的措施鼓励了农民的经营主动性，并且大大推进了农业生产的发展。1954—1958年农业生产的增长量为25％，而商品生产的增长量约为35％。1957年和1958年农村的自力投资比1955年和1956年增加了五十四亿兹罗提。为1959年的收成而采购的人造肥料比1958年增加了30％。1958年采用优良种子比1956年增加了12％。农村建设有了大规模的发展。
    哥穆尔卡接着详细地谈到了农业方面的投资方针问题。他说，根据波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的指示，1959—1965年农业投资应当为一千三百亿兹罗提，同时规定，其中生产投资为九百三十亿兹罗提。对发展农业生产十分重要的、具有决定意义的投资目标是：
    第一，机械化。有鉴于此，波兰统一工人党中央政治局建议把第三次代表大会所作的指示中的平均指标作如下的增加：把1959—1965年拖拉机的供应由原来计划的八万台增加到十一万二千台。计划增加拖拉机装备，这将使农业有可能在1965年把约三分之一主要的田间工作实现机械化。
    第二，建议扩大1961—1965年土壤改良工作计划，并且要把为这一工作而拨出的款额增加到一百七十亿多兹罗提。这意味着，把用于这方面的投资增加为目前的五年计划用于这方面的投资的三倍。进行土壤改良的结果，在1961—1965年期间，农业将能得到约八百万吨（折合成干草计算）饲料。
    第三，七年计划期间，用作农村建设的拨款达二百三十四亿兹罗提。在1961—1965年期间计划在农村建立一百二十万间住房和生产用建筑物，建设成本达四百亿兹罗提左右。农村居民实行私人投资和提供劳动，以及为最大限度缩减建筑成本创造条件，对完成规模这样大的建设和充分利用国家提供的援助具有决定性的意义。
    哥穆尔卡说，要保证少地农民和中农群众能够广泛地应用现代技术。为完成广泛的改良土壤计划以及正确使用改良土壤的设备，要求农民运用集体的力量和积累公有资金。因此，在农村必须建立一个群众性的、广泛的、经济性的农民社会组织，它的主要任务是，动员农民把个人的努力同互助合作联系起来，同时依靠公有资金和国家的帮助，来扩大生产和改进生产。农业小组应当是这种组织。农业小组应当掌握大部分供农户用的拖拉机和机器。它们应当在农村起集体劳动组织者的作用，应当起公有生产资料的组织者的作用。因此农业小组应当成为包括绝大多数农村居民的普遍性组织，它们应当掌握必要的财政资金。农业小组应当成为大量农业机器的所有者。这样，农业小组的社会性质就有了社会主义内容。由于农业小组拥有机器这便把它们变成为全体农民的群众性的、普遍性的社会经济组织。为了使农业小组能成为这样的组织，它们就应当具备相应的条件和可能性来进行自己的活动，它们应当拥有必要的资金以便购置农业机器。这笔资金应当由国家提供，并用农村自己的资金加以扩充。
    我们党在进行活动时同统一农民党取得了一致。我们的党是根据这样的原则出发的：扩大农业机械化和土壤改良的纲领要求国家拨给农业小组一笔款项，这笔款项是来自农民到目前为止的义务交售和国家为供应自由市场所取得的价格的差额。
    这样，我们在农村的经济发展和社会发展史上揭开了新的一页，这一页将记载下农业机械化、集体使用机器、大规模改良土壤、在农业小组的新的活动范围内实行农民自治的历史。
    哥穆尔卡说，提高农业小组的作用和意义的新主张是对党的第三次代表大会关于党的农村政策的决议的建设性发展。这个决议的社会实质是把农村全面地引向社会主义发展的道路，农业小组绝不是同生产合作社对立的因素，相反，应当把它们看成是一所形成农民对集体经营的思想觉悟和实际习惯的学校。特别是贯彻农业生产过程机械化的主张，将不断地使农民接近于生产合作化的思想。
    党坚持农村社会主义改造这一纲领，同时认为这个改造只有在建立大规模集体农业经济、即生产合作社的情况下才能够完成，但是这个改造的目的首先应当是扩大农业生产。只有经过农民的同意才能建立集体农民经济。
    哥穆尔卡说，农业小组和农业生产合作社都要求党集中精力发展它们。无论前者和后者都是服务于为进一步发展农业而进行的农村的社会主义改造的事业的。
    哥穆尔卡说，在决议草案中提出的农业精耕细作和在群众性社会经济农业组织——农业小组的基础上改造农业技术基础的纲领使我们党面临许多新的、广泛的和多方面的任务。我们党的同盟者——统一农民党也面临着这些任务。因为这是共同纲领。这是扩大和加深我们党的各级组织和统一农民党的各级组织在农村进行合作的广泛基础。目前有条件和有必要提出实现这样的口号：波兰统一工人党和统一农民党的每个党员都应当成为农业小组的积极分子。
    凡是有党的组织的农村，党的组织应该倡导成立农业小组，并为现有的小组进行宣传。在还没有党的组织的农村，应当在专门派去的区和乡积极分子代表的帮助下，建立农业小组。在丝毫不影响而且会加强农业小组自治管理的情况下，波兰统一工人党的组织和波兰统一农民党的小组一道，尽力使有觉悟的少地农民和中农在农业小组的领导中具有决定性的发言权，这些人必须关心公共财产并合理支配这些财产。因此必须保证波兰统一工人党在农业小组中起领导作用以及发挥这个组织的自治性。
    哥穆尔卡最后说，我们拟定的纲领的实现不仅决定着农业本身的发展和农村的变革，而且也决定着整个国民经济的发展。因此，这一纲领的实现不仅是农村的事情，而且它应该成为工人阶级的事情，城市的事情和全民的事情。
    这个纲领开辟了宏伟的前景，为党在农村的工作创造了有利的条件并且指出了一条道路，沿着这条道路可以稳步地、大规模地向第三次党代表大会指出的目标——提高农业生产和在农村中逐步建设社会主义迈进。
