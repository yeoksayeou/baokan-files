"Commodity Hospital"
By our reporter Zhang Zhiqing

    A lively scene has recently emerged in the Dongsi People's Market in Beijing: a bustling crowd comes and goes all day long, some leaving with things in high spirits. They bring unusable items, but take away useful ones.
    Because it mends the old and repairs the damaged for people, they affectionately call this market a "Commodity Hospital."
    The scope of commodities repaired by this "hospital" is very broad, from large to small, from new to old, from simple to complex; as long as they can repair it, they will undertake it.

    "A Package Deal"
    A surveying team working in the field for a long time had damaged a lot of their various tools and equipment.
    One day, a member of this team came to the market with eighteen locks without keys, as well as zippered bags, kerosene lamps, a *huqin*, a small iron box, and other old and broken tools. He originally planned to come to this market to fix the locks first, and then go to other repair shops to fix and replace the rest.
    The market's clerk quickly repaired all the locks for him, but he was still reluctant to leave. He pointed to the small iron box next to him and said, "These things have to be repaired in those streets!"
    The clerk warmly said to him, "It's far, but also near. The far place is Qianmenwai Street, but we can repair it for you right here."
    The surveyor was overjoyed when he heard this. He quickly sent a large batch of items to be repaired to the clerk and excitedly said, "This saves me from running all over the city. I never expected that this place has become a hospital that can cure all ailments!" Before long, all the waste materials he brought were repaired.

    Serving Production
    When the Beijing Tractor Research Institute was installing a generator, they urgently needed 25 cm long glass tubes, but they only had 50 cm long glass tubes. They had sent people to many factories, but no one knew how to cut these tubes.
    A female cadre from this research institute, with a "let's try it" attitude, brought the glass tubes to the market to see if they could be cut in half. The market's clerk saw it and felt that this was difficult to do. Not only did they not have the necessary equipment, but they had never cut this kind of thing before. However, the belief in supporting production encouraged them. After consulting with the customer, the clerk used a bow saw to carefully try to saw it. Soon, the glass tube was indeed sawn off, and it met the specifications.
    Two days later, the remaining ten glass tubes were all sawn off.

    A Pair of Nearsighted Glasses
    It was past 8 pm, and the quitting-time bell was about to ring. Many customers were walking out, but a woman was squeezing in. As soon as she found the eyeglass repair counter, she said to the repairman in a hurry, "My nearsighted glasses are broken. I have to listen to a report and take notes tomorrow morning, I must wear them..." She glanced at the clerk and continued to ask with a lack of confidence, "Can you rush to repair them for me?"
    The repairman saw how anxious she was, immediately took the glasses, and asked her to sit down for a while. In less than half an hour, the glasses were repaired.
    The woman paid a repair fee of twenty cents, put on her glasses, and left happily.
    The repair services of this market are now continuing to expand and increase. According to statistics from the market management department, in recent months, more than 5,000 people have entrusted the repair of various appliances here. Among them are 200 children's vehicles and more than 800 sets of bicycle dynamos. Now, based on existing conditions, they are planning to further increase the repair services that are most urgently needed by the people. (Attached photo)

### “商品医院”

    “商品医院”
    本报记者　张志清
    北京东四人民市场，最近出现了一片热闹景象：熙熙攘攘的人群整天来来往往，有的兴致勃勃地带着东西走。带来的是不能用的物品，带走的却都是有用的东西。
    因为它给人们补旧整新，修破缝伤，所以人们亲切地把这个市场叫做“商品医院”。
    这个“医院”承修的商品范围很广，从大到小，从新到旧，从简便到复杂，只要他们能修理的商品，都一概承修。
    “一揽子”
    有个勘探测量队，长期在野外工作，用的各种用具损坏了很多。
    有一天，这个队的一位队员，拿着十八个没有钥匙的锁和拉锁提包、汽灯、胡琴、小铁箱等多种破旧用具来到市场。他本来打算先来这个市场把锁修好以后，再分别到其它各个修理商店去修配。
    市场的业务员很快地给他把锁统统修好了，但是他还不肯走，他指着身旁的小铁箱说：“这些东西都得到那些街道去修呢！”
    业务员亲热地对他说：“说远也很远，说近也很近，远的地方有前门外大街，近的地方，我们就可以给你修理。”
    测量队员一听可乐极了。他连忙把带来的一大批待整修的东西送到业务员面前，兴奋地说：“这可省得我满城跑了，真没想到你们这里成了百病都治的医院！”没等多长时间，他带来的一大堆废旧物资就全部修好了。
    为生产服务
    北京拖拉机研究所在安装发电机的时候，急需二十五公分长的玻璃管子，可是他们只有五十公分长的玻璃管子，他们曾经派人到过许多工厂，都没有打问出谁能锯这种管子。
    这个研究所的一位女干部，带着“试试看”的心理，把玻璃管带到市场，看能不能把它锯成两截，市场的业务员一看，觉得这事不好办，不但没有必要设备，而且也从来没锯过这东西。但是，支持生产的信念鼓舞着他们，商得顾客的同意后，业务员采用搜弓子锯的办法，小心翼翼地试锯，不久，玻璃管子果然被锯断了，而且合乎规格的要求。
    两天以后，其余十根玻璃管都给锯断了。
    一副近视眼镜
    过了晚八点，下班铃快要响了，许多顾客都往外走，有一位女同志却偏偏往里挤。一找见眼镜修理柜台，就急匆匆地对修理人员说：“我的近视眼镜坏了，明天早晨就要听报告，作记录，必须戴它……”。她瞧了业务员一眼，带着没有信心的口气继续问业务员：“能不能给我赶修一下？”
    修理员看到她急呼呼的样子，立即接过眼镜，让她先坐一会，不到半个小时，眼镜就修好了。
    女同志付了两角钱的修理费，戴上眼镜，满心欢喜地走了。
    这个市场的修理项目，现在正在继续扩大和增加。据市场管理部门统计，最近几个月来，已有五千多人次在这里委托修理了各种用具。其中有二百辆儿童车、八百多套自行车磨电灯。现在他们根据现有条件，正在筹划进一步增加有关人民生活最迫切需要的修理业务。（附图片）
