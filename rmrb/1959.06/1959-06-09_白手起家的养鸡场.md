Title: Chicken Farm Built from Scratch

A car drove to the Nanshan Chicken Coop of the Jinsha Farm in Mishan, here to transport eggs. The chicken raising group of the Eighth Team of the Second Branch Farm delivered goods to the state for the first time!

As everyone watched the thirty thousand eggs drive away in the car, the chicken-raising girls waved to the rising dust, excitedly saying, "In this year in the Great Northern Wilderness, we have not disappointed the Party!"

This chicken-raising group was established last spring by a group of demobilized military officers and their families who built small thatched houses by hand on this weedy hillside roamed by wolves. There were no "poultry experts" here, no modern equipment, and even the curtains were woven by hand from grass. In just one year, they raised two thousand three hundred and forty white egg-laying hens. They collect about one thousand seven hundred eggs every day. This is a glorious task!

As the sun rises, this small chicken farm is filled with the sounds of roosters crowing and chicks chirping. There are fluffy chicks just pecking their way out of their shells, and five-pound hens that are "clucking" and laying eggs.

There is an incubation room here, but no heating. The fire wall also did not reach the standard temperature, so they hollowed out the ground and squatted by the stove day and night, burning from underground to keep the incubation temperature inside the room at thirty-eight or thirty-nine degrees.

In the brooding room, there are no painted or electroplated brooding racks, but sunflower stalks are used instead; without ropes or nails, they go up the mountain to find the bark of small linden trees to replace them. Without electric lights, the girls on the night shift have to hold a kerosene lamp in one hand and disperse the crowded chickens with the other.

"Cluck, cluck!" The chickens need to eat, but where does the feed come from? More than two thousand chickens need more than seven hundred pounds of feed every day. They did not ask the state for a single grain, feeding them chaff and grass seeds; large pumpkins and cabbages, long beans planted alongside sorghum fields in the autumn, or searching for shells and tadpoles in the river; as well as discarded shriveled sorghum and corn cobs from the farm. This spring, the lack of green fodder affected egg production. As soon as the soil showed the first signs of grass sprouting, the branch called on everyone to give the hens a gift every day—"one pound of green fodder." At this time, those raising rabbits, bees, and pigs all went out to find green fodder.

The conditions are poor, and the ideals are high, so one must put in hard work. Take a look at the tense work of Jiang Xiuzhi and Geng Xiqin, the girls on the night shift in the brooding room. To prevent the chicks from freezing, they have to heat the fire wall; to prevent crowding, they have to constantly patrol the chicken racks; at dawn, the intense feeding work begins again.

In July last year, a serious chicken plague came. Using needles and pen tips, they injected vaccines under the chickens' wings, and the plague finally disappeared.

With such good keepers, what is so strange about building a chicken farm from scratch on a barren hillside?

Next year, the year after, and the years after that, this place will become the home of chickens, and the chicken coops at that time will not be the thousand meters planned for this year, but expanded several times or dozens of times. More people will eat eggs produced in the Great Northern Wilderness!

    白手起家的养鸡场
    常青
    一辆汽车开到了密山金沙农场南山鸡舍，这是来运鸡蛋的。二分场八队养鸡组，第一次向国家交货了！
    当大家打发三万个鸡蛋坐上汽车开走时，养鸡姑娘们向腾起的烟尘挥着手，她们兴奋地说：“到北大荒这一年，我们没有使党失望！”
    这个养鸡组是去年春天由一批下放军官，和他们的家属在这杂草丛生、野狼周旋的小山坡上，亲手搭起了小草房建立起来的。这里没有“家禽专家”，没有现代化的设备，甚至窗帘也都是他们用草亲手编织的。仅仅一年，他们养了二千三百四十只雪白的卵用母鸡。每天要收蛋一千七百个左右。这是一份光荣的任务呵！
    旭日东升，这小小的鸡场，鸡声喔喔，雏声啾啾。这里有刚刚啄碎蛋壳钻出头来的绒球样的小鸡，也有“呱呱”下蛋的体重五斤的母鸡。
    这里有孵卵室，但没有暖气，火墙又达不到标准温度，他们就把地下挖空，昼夜蹲在灶口，从地下燃烧，使室内卵眠温度达到三十八、九度。
    在育雏室里，没有油漆或电度的育雏架，而是用向日葵秆子代替它；没有绳子和钉子，就上山寻找小椴树的皮来代替。没有电灯，值夜班的姑娘不得不一手提着柴油灯，一手去拨散挤压在一起的鸡群。
    “咕，咕！”鸡要吃，饲料那里来？二千多只鸡，每天需要七百多斤饲料。他们没有向国家要一粒粮食，喂的是秕糠、草籽；秋天高粱地里捎带种的大窝瓜、小白菜，长豆角或到河里寻找贝壳、蝌蚪；还有场园抛弃的瘪高粱、瘪棒子。今年春天，青饲料缺乏，影响产卵。支部就在地皮刚露出草芽时，号召每人每天给母鸡送礼物——“一斤青饲料”。这时养兔、蜂、猪的人全部出动去寻找青饲料。
    条件很差，理想很高，就不能不付出艰辛的劳动。看一看育雏室夜班姑娘姜秀芝、耿希琴的紧张工作吧，为了怕小鸡受冻，她们要烧热火墙；为了防止挤压，她们要不断地巡视鸡架；天亮了，紧张地喂食工作又开始了。
    去年7月，严重的鸡瘟传来了。大头针、钢笔尖，蘸着疫苗在鸡翅膀下进行注射，瘟情终于消失了。
    有这样好的饲养员，在荒凉的山坡白手起家建起养鸡场，这又有什么奇怪呢？
    明年，后年，大后年这里将成为鸡的家乡，那时的鸡舍不是今年计划的一千公尺，而是几倍几十倍的扩大。更多的人将吃到北大荒出产的鸡蛋！
