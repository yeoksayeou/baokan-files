　　Less Input, More Food Output, Delicious and Filling
　　Black Mountain County Creates Method for Increasing Corn Consumption
　　(Our dispatch) The Three Platform Management Area subsidiary production team of the Satellite Commune in Black Mountain County, Liaoning Province, has created an experience of “boiling corn first, then grinding, then steaming” to increase the amount of food produced. Adopting this advanced cooking method can fully exploit the nutritional value of corn, and it uses less input, produces more food, is delicious and filling, and increases the food output rate by 50% to 80% compared with the previous general cooking methods. The masses praised this as a "bumper harvest" without cultivation.
　　The method for increasing corn consumption is relatively simple. The method is: first wash the corn twice with clean water, and after washing it clean, boil it in a pot until it is 60% cooked. Take it out and rinse it twice with cold water, then grind it into a fine water flour (or called Tangzi flour), and you can make cornbread, steamed buns, and other pastries.
　　To successfully adopt this method, two key points must be grasped: First, the heat must be controlled well when boiling. If it is boiled too mushy, it will be sticky, difficult to grind, and not delicious. If it is boiled too hard, it cannot be ground into fine flour, there will be many small particles, and the yield will be low; it is best to boil it until it is 60% cooked (break open the boiled corn kernels by hand, and it is just right if there is about one-third of the white core in the middle). Second, the finer the grinding, the better. It is best to use a fine mill for grinding tofu. When grinding, the moisture content should be well controlled. The flour should be suitable to make cornbread and steamed buns without adding water; if it is too dry, the yield will be low, and if it is too thin, it will not be formed into individual pieces, and it will be sticky and not delicious. In summer, it is best to boil, grind, make, and eat immediately, to avoid souring after a long time.
　　According to the feedback from the local masses and the summaries from relevant departments, adopting this cooking method has four major benefits: First, it greatly increases the food output of corn and can save a lot of grain. Using the old method to make cornbread, one catty of corn produces one catty and five taels to one catty and seven taels; using this new method, one catty of corn can produce two catties and five taels to two catties and seven taels of cornbread, and the highest can produce three catties of cornbread. Second, it improves the nutritional value of corn. With the old method, the flour and dregs are very coarse, and proteins, fats, etc. cannot be fully absorbed. The corn germ is a good thing, but it used to be thrown away. Its oil content is over 40%, which is more than soybeans; the quality of germ oil is also very good, and it tastes better than bean and peanut oil. In the past, corn husks could not be crushed either, and the nutrients were also wasted. The new method can utilize the germ and husks, and the inherent aroma of corn is also brought into play. Third, it is beneficial to hygiene, easy to digest, and can reduce gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, this flour can be used to make noodles, dumplings, pancakes, silk cakes, flatbreads, etc. There are many varieties, the taste is fresh, and no alkali or other seasonings are needed when making them. This subsidiary production team canteen originally only had more than 30 people eating, but now it has increased to more than 120 people.
　　The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee attach great importance to this experience and require all localities to make this advanced experience blossom everywhere.

### 用量少　出饭多  既好吃　又顶饱  黑山县创造玉米食用增量法

    用量少　出饭多  既好吃　又顶饱
    黑山县创造玉米食用增量法
    本报讯　辽宁省黑山县卫星公社三台子管理区副业生产队食堂创造了“玉米先煮、后磨、再蒸”的食用增量经验。采用这种先进作饭法，可以充分发挥了玉米的营养价值，而且用量少，多出饭，好吃又抗饿，比过去的一般作饭法提高出饭率50％到80％。群众称赞这是不用耕耘的一次“大丰收”。
    玉米食用增量法的作法比较简单，方法是：先把玉米用清水淘两遍，淘干净后用锅煮，煮到六成熟，捞出来再用凉水过两遍，然后再用磨磨成细水面（或叫汤子面），就可以作饼子、窝窝头和其他糕点了。
    要成功地采用这种办法，必须抓住两个关键：一是煮时要掌握好火候，煮得太烂了发粘，不好磨，也不好吃；煮得太硬了，磨不成细面，小粒子多，又不出数；最好煮到六成熟（把煮好的玉米粒用手?开，中间有三分之一左右的白心就正好）。二是磨得越细越好，最好用磨豆腐的细磨来磨。磨时要掌握好水分，磨成的面以不用掺水就能作成饼子、窝窝头的程度为合适；干了不出数，稀了作不成个，还发粘、不好吃。夏天最好现煮、现磨、现做、现吃，免得时间长了容易发酸。
    根据当地群众的反映和有关部门的总结，采用这种作饭法有四大好处：一、大大提高了玉米的出饭量，可以节约大量的粮食。用过去的方法做饼子，一斤玉米出一斤五两到一斤七两；用这种新方法，一斤玉米就可以出二斤五两到二斤七两饼子，最高的可以出三斤饼子。二、提高了玉米的营养价值。旧的作法，面子和?子都很粗，蛋白质、脂肪等不能被充分吸收。玉米脐子是好东西，过去白扔了，它的含油量在40％以上，比大豆还多；脐子油的质量也非常好，比豆子、花生油还好吃。玉米皮过去也不能粉碎，营养成分也白白丢掉了。新的作用就能使脐子、皮子被利用起来，玉米的固有香味也发挥出来了。三、有益卫生，容易消化，可以减少肠胃病。而且用这种面可以做面条、饺子、煎饼、丝糕、大饼等，花样多，味新鲜，做时还不需要碱和其它调料。这个副业生产队食堂原来只有三十多人吃饭，现在已增加到一百二十多人。
    中共辽宁省委和省人民委员会对这项经验非常重视，要求各地使这一先进经验遍地开花。
