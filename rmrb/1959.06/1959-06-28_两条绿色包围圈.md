    Two Green Encirclements
    If someone were to draw a colored plan of Zunyi City, it would be very clear that Zunyi City is surrounded by two green belts. The inner green belt is composed of fruit trees such as apples, tangerines, and oranges, and the outer layer is composed of Eucommia trees for extracting hard rubber.
    Zunyi City is a ribbon-shaped city surrounded by mountains. Standing on the bank of the Xiangjiang River, facing east and with your back to the west, Phoenix Mountain is in front and Honghuagang is behind.
    From the second year after liberation, the city’s party and government leaders paid attention to the greening of the barren hills around the city, and combined it with the development of fruit orchards, adopting the method of mobilizing the party, government, army, and people. At present, more than 16,000 mu of barren hillsides surrounding the urban area have grown robust fruit trees. Apple trees alone account for more than 280,000 trees, plus more than 440,000 fruit trees such as tangerines, oranges, peaches, and apricots. If calculated based on the population of the urban area of Zunyi and the nearby suburban areas where fruit trees are distributed, there is an average of five fruit trees for every two people.
    The second green belt of Zunyi City is composed of Eucommia trees. Eucommia bark is one of the precious medicinal materials in traditional Chinese medicine. Eucommia trees are also the best raw material for extracting hard rubber. This rubber is resistant to acid, alkali, corrosion, and voltage, and is the best insulating material for submarine cables. The entire Eucommia tree contains abundant gelatinous substances. If you break a piece of Eucommia leaf, although the leaf surface is divided into two, the leaf center is connected by thousands of silvery silk threads. Zunyi City began to cultivate Eucommia forests in 1954 to provide conditions for the construction of rubber refineries. Now it has formed an Eucommia forest belt with an average width of two li and a length of fifty li, becoming the second green belt surrounding Zunyi City.

    两条绿色包围圈
    如果有人给遵义市画一幅彩色平面图，那就看得很清楚，遵义市被两条绿色带子所包围。里一层绿带由苹果、柑、桔等果木树组成，外层由提炼硬质橡胶的杜仲树组成。
    遵义市是处于群山包围中的带形城市。站在湘江岸边，面东背西而站，前是凤凰山，后是红花岗。
    从解放第二年，市党政领导部门，就注意了城周围秃山的绿化工作，并与发展果林相结合，采取党政军民一齐动手的办法。目前包围市区的一万六千多亩荒山坡，都已生长起茁壮的果树，光苹果树就占二十八万多株，加上柑、桔、桃、杏等有四十四万多株果树。如果以遵义市区及果树分布范围的近郊区人口计算，每两个人平均有五棵果树。
    遵义市的第二条绿带由杜仲树组成。杜仲树皮是中药里名贵药材之一。杜仲树又是提炼硬质橡胶的最好原料。这种橡胶能耐酸、耐碱、耐腐蚀、耐电压，是海底电线的最好绝缘材料。杜仲树全身都含有丰富的胶质。拿一片杜仲树叶搿断，叶面虽分为二，叶心却被千丝万缕的银色胶丝连在一起。遵义市从1954年开始营造杜仲林，为建设炼胶厂提供条件，现在已形成平均有二华里宽、五十华里长的杜仲林带，成为包围遵义市的第二层绿带。
