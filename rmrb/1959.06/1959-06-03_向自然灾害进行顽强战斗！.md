    Fighting Tenaciously Against Natural Disasters!
    Jilin Expands Irrigation Area in the Anti-Drought Campaign
    150,000 People in Fujian Participate in Flood Control Efforts
    Shaanxi Resolutely Combats Wheat Rust to Strive for a Bumper Harvest
    Jilin
    (Our newspaper Changchun, 2nd dispatch) The broad masses of farmers in Jilin Province, having achieved victory in the 1958 anti-drought struggle, have recently launched another anti-drought campaign to ensure the transplanting of paddy fields and the full and robust growth of seedlings in dryland fields.
    Since the spring sowing, Jilin Province has experienced a severe drought, threatening the transplanting of rice and the growth of seedlings. To overcome the drought, hundreds of thousands of people throughout the province have participated in anti-drought activities, and pumping machines everywhere have been put into operation. In the Siping area, which is more severely affected by the drought, the slogan put forward by the commune members is: "If water is insufficient, enthusiasm is sufficient." Qinghe Management Area in Dongfeng County rushed to dig fourteen artesian wells and raised the height of the river dam, solving the irrigation water problem for twenty-seven hectares of paddy fields and part of the dryland fields. In Jiaohe County, each commune immediately extracted part of the labor force to put into the anti-drought struggle right after the climax of spring sowing. After more than ten days of hard work, the Dailu River Management Area of Songjiang Commune dug canals on the mountainside and erected aqueducts over the ditches to introduce the water of the Sandaogou River into the reservoir, ensuring the water supply for nearby paddy fields.
    According to recent statistics, this year the province has dug 37,000 water wells, 1,200 mechanical wells, more than 10,000 artesian wells, intercepted more than 3,000 underground streams, and newly built and renovated more than 900 reservoirs, ponds and dams, increasing the irrigated area by more than 200,000 hectares. Various places have also taken many effective measures to strengthen water management, speed up weeding and compaction, and reduce water evaporation.
    In this anti-drought campaign, various places have deeply mobilized the masses, and timely criticized the negative thoughts of some cadres and masses, such as "drought in May doesn't count as drought" and "transplant rice after it rains." The Hewanzi Commune in Yongji County first held a meeting of management area cadres, and after field investigation of water sources and discussions, proposed measures such as repairing canals, damming rivers, digging wells, and excavating springs, which greatly boosted people's confidence in the struggle.

    Fujian
    (Xinhua News Agency Fuzhou, 2nd dispatch) The rainy season has arrived in Fujian Province, and flood peaks have been continuously appearing in various rivers. In order to strive for a bumper summer harvest, flood prevention and flood control battles have been launched everywhere. At present, on the long dikes of the Minjiang River, Tingjiang River, Jiulong River, and other important rivers, there are large numbers of flood control personnel patrolling day and night, reinforcing embankments and rescuing dangerous dikes.
    Along the Minjiang and Jiulongjiang Rivers, more than 150,000 people participate in flood control and rescue struggles every day. They have reinforced and renovated many important sections and newly built water conservancy projects, and prepared a large number of flood control materials such as sacks, sandbags, boats, and vehicles for emergency needs. The people's communes in the mountainous areas of the Minjiang River have rushed to repair small-scale water conservancy projects and spillways along the rivers. Nanping City, upstream of the Minjiang River, is where the Jianxi River and the Futunxi River converge into the river, which is prone to flooding. In recent days, more than 600 flood drainage ditches have been built here, protecting more than 12,000 mu of farmland from flood disasters. In Pucheng County in northern Fujian, various communes organized more than 3,300 people to rush to repair more than 4,700 various flood control water conservancy projects, benefiting more than 100,000 mu of farmland. The communes also timely cleaned and straightened rice fields that had been washed away by floods, allowing these seedlings to quickly turn green and grow well.
    The communes in coastal areas are also taking measures to step up preparations against typhoons and storm surges. So far, 500 kilometers of sea dikes and river dikes have been renovated and reinforced. The fourteen larger reservoirs in the coastal hilly areas, such as Dongzhang, Shibi, Tingxi, and Lingxi, have also recently begun to store water and discharge floods in succession.
    Because the flood prevention and flood control work is progressing quickly, various crops in the river basins and coastal areas of the province are currently growing normally. In the Jiulongjiang and Jinjiang river basins, where the season is earlier, early rice has already headed and flowered. In the Minjiang River basin, large areas of early rice and mid-season rice are generally growing vigorously. The masses everywhere are continuing to strengthen flood prevention and flood control work on the one hand, and strengthening field management on the other, striving for a bumper summer harvest.
    Shaanxi
    (Our newspaper Xi'an, 2nd dispatch) For more than half a year, the farmers in various parts of Shaanxi have carried out repeated and tenacious struggles against stripe rust, and are currently engaged in the final battle to strive for a bumper harvest under the threat of stripe rust.
    This year's wheat stripe rust in Shaanxi Province is the most serious year since liberation. In order to prevent and control this disease as early as possible, last December, the province dispatched one million people to treat six million mu of wheat fields where stripe rust was found. Since the beginning of spring this year, the people of the province have launched a vigorous anti-rust movement. By the end of April, the development of the disease in four million mu of wheat fields affected by stripe rust had been basically controlled. However, since May, due to more cloudy and rainy weather and high humidity, stripe rust has continued to spread in large quantities from the southern Guanzhong area to the northern Guanzhong area. According to recent statistics, the newly developed area has reached 2.1 million mu, which, together with the previously accumulated area, totals 6.1 million mu times of diseased area in the province. Some counties (cities) that rarely contracted rust in the past have now begun to spread extensively.
    In response to these situations, the Shaanxi Provincial Summer Harvest Headquarters recently held an emergency telephone conference, requiring all localities to concentrate their efforts and quickly launch a mass assault movement to eliminate rust.
    At present, Xingping, Sanyuan, and Dali counties, which are more severely affected along the Weihe River, dispatch about 300,000 people every day to comprehensively encircle and suppress stripe rust. Zhouzhi County, which has continuously persisted in rust prevention for half a year, has generally treated the more than 200,000 mu of wheat fields that originally had stripe rust twice since mid-May.
    Relevant persons in charge of Shaanxi Province believe that in future rust prevention work, on the one hand, experience should be accumulated to strengthen prevention and control; on the other hand, excellent varieties should be selected and bred in large quantities to prevent variety homogenization. The person in charge also said: Rust is a relatively difficult disease to prevent and control. Although the people of the province have made great efforts, they still cannot completely control it. Therefore, it will directly affect this year's wheat yield. (Attached picture)

    向自然灾害进行顽强战斗！
    吉林在抗旱运动中扩大灌溉面积
    福建各地十五万人参加防汛斗争
    陕西坚决围剿锈病争取小麦丰收
    吉林
    本报长春2日电　在1958年抗旱斗争中取得胜利的吉林省广大农民，最近又展开了保证水田插秧和旱田苗全苗壮的抗旱运动。
    春播以来，吉林省出现严重旱象，威胁着插秧和禾苗的生长。为了战胜干旱，全省已有几十万人参加抗旱活动，各地的抽水机都开动起来。旱象较重的四平地区，社员们提出的口号是：水不足，干劲足。东丰县庆和管理区突击挖了十四眼自流泉，加高了拦河坝，解决了二十七公顷水田和部分旱田的灌溉用水。蛟河县各公社在春播高潮刚过，立即抽出部分劳动力投入抗旱斗争。松江公社代露河管理区经过十几天的奋战，在山腰挖渠道，在沟上架起渡槽，把三道沟河的水引入水库，使附近水田用水有了保证。
    据最近统计，全省今年已打水井三万七千眼，打机井一千二百眼，挖自流泉一万多眼，截潜流三千多处，新建与整修水库塘坝九百多处，共增加灌溉面积二十多万公顷。各地还采取了许多有效办法，加强用水管理，加紧铲趟、镇压，减少水分蒸发。
    在这次抗旱中，各地都深入发动了群众，对有些干部和群众存在的“五月旱不算旱”，“下雨再插秧”等消极思想及时进行了批判。永吉县河湾子公社首先召开了管理区干部会议，经过实地调查水源和座谈，提出了修渠、拦河、打井、挖泉等措施，人们斗争的信心更加高涨。　　　　　（李树功）
    福建
    新华社福州2日电　福建省的雨季已经到来，各江河不断出现洪峰，为争取夏季丰收，各地普遍展开了防洪防汛战斗。目前，闽江、汀江、九龙江等各重要江河的长堤上，日夜都有大批的防汛人员往来巡逻，加固堤坝和抢救险堤。
    闽江九龙江沿线各人民公社，每天有十五万多人参加防洪抢险斗争，他们加固、整修了许多险要地段和新建的水利工程，并准备了麻袋、沙包、船只、车辆等大批防汛器材，以备紧急需要。闽江山区各人民公社对各江河沿线的小型水利工程和溢洪道等工程进行了抢修。闽江上游南平市是建溪和富屯溪汇流入江的地方，容易发生洪水，最近几天，这里修建了六百多条排洪沟，保护了一万二千多亩山田免受洪灾。闽北的浦城县各公社组织三千三百多人突击抢修了各种防洪水利工程四千七百多处，受益农田达十多万亩。各公社还及时清洗、扶直了遭受洪水冲刷的稻田，使这些秧苗迅速转青长好。
    沿海地区各公社，也在采取措施加紧防备台风和大潮风的到来。现在已经整修、加固海堤、江堤达五百多公里。沿海丘陵地带的东张、石壁、汀溪、凌溪等十四个较大的水库，最近也陆续开始蓄水泄洪。
    由于防洪防汛工作进行得快，全省各江河流域和沿海地区的各种农作物目前生长正常，季节较早的九龙江、晋江流域，早稻已经抽穗扬花，闽江流域的大片早稻、中稻普遍茁壮，各地群众正一面继续加强防汛防洪工作，一面加强田间管理，争取夏季大丰收。
    陕西
    本报西安2日电　陕西各地农民，半年多来同条锈病进行了反复的顽强的斗争，目前正进行最后一战，争取在条锈病害的威胁下，取得丰收。
    陕西省本年度小麦条锈病是解放后最严重的一年。为了及早防治这种病害，去年12月，全省即出动了一百万人，把六百万亩发现有条锈病的麦田防治了一遍。今年开春以来，全省人民又展开了一个轰轰烈烈的防锈运动，到4月底，四百万亩发生条锈病的麦田，基本上控制了病害的发展。但是，自5月份以来，由于阴雨多、湿度大，条锈病又大量地由关中南部向关中北部继续蔓延。截止最近统计，新发展的面积达到二百一十万亩，连以前累计，全省发病面积共有六百一十万亩次。过去很少感染锈病的一些县（市），现在也开始大量蔓延。
    针对这种种情况，陕西省夏收指挥部最近召开了紧急电话会议，要求各地集中力量，迅速掀起一个消灭锈病的群众性的突击运动。
    目前沿渭河两岸发病比较严重的兴平、三原、大荔三县，每天约出动三十万人，全面围剿条锈病。半年来不断坚持防锈的盩厔县，5月中旬以来又把原来发生条锈病的二十多万亩麦田，普遍防治了两遍。
    陕西省有关负责人认为，今后在防锈工作中，一方面要积累经验加强防治；另方面要大量选育优良品种，防止品种单一化。这位负责人还说：锈病是一种比较难防治的病害，全省人民虽然经过很大努力，但还不能完全控制，因此，它将直接影响今年小麦的产量。（附图片）
