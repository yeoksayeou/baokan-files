    A Measure to Implement Land Reform and Other Revolutionary Laws
    Partial Reshuffle of the Cuban Cabinet
    Five Ministers, Including Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Replaced
    (Dispatch from this newspaper in Havana) The Cuban Provisional Government cabinet has decided to carry out a partial reshuffle. At a cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister Castro on the 12th, it was decided that Raúl Roa, the former Cuban representative to the Organization of American States, would replace Agramonte as Minister of Foreign Affairs; Pedro Miret would replace Humberto Sori Marin as Minister of Agriculture; José Naranjo would replace Luis Orlando Rodríguez as Minister of Interior; Raquel Pérez de Miret (female) would replace Elena Mederos (female) as Minister of Public Welfare; and Serafín de Zalaarate would replace Julio Martínez Páez as Minister of Health.
    Sources in Havana believe that the reshuffle of the Cuban cabinet is a significant measure for effectively implementing the Land Reform Law and other revolutionary laws. Some of the replaced cabinet ministers were relatively right-leaning and conservative figures in the Provisional Government. For example, former Foreign Minister Agramonte did not advocate establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, even though the Soviet Union had already recognized the Cuban Provisional Government. He also advocated against allowing the Cuban People's Socialist Party (Communist Party) to participate in the government. Regarding Cuba's relations with the United States, he believed they would be "harmonious and sincere." Agramonte's views were strongly refuted by the "July 26th Movement" newspaper. In a commentary published on January 30, the newspaper stated, "Contrary to the Minister's opinion, we believe that Cuba should establish diplomatic and economic relations with all countries willing to establish relations with Cuba." Former Minister of Agriculture Humberto Sori Marin, although the drafter of "Decree No. 3" promulgated by the Cuban rebel forces in the old base area of the Sierra Maestra, disagreed with touching the large plantation system.
    The newly appointed Foreign Minister Raúl Roa, at the Organization of American States meeting held in Washington on June 3 to discuss the Nicaraguan situation, opposed US imperialism's use of the Organization of American States to interfere in Nicaragua's internal affairs. He argued that the armed struggle that broke out in Nicaragua did not pose a threat to any American country and should therefore be resolved by Nicaragua itself. Later, he also stated that Cuba opposed investigating the Nicaraguan situation, emphasizing that "the Organization of American States must not be used by those who like to play with fire as a powder keg."
    According to a United Press International dispatch, some Cuban cabinet members and large landowners opposed the recently announced Land Reform Law. The report said that some ministers had threatened to resign unless the Land Reform Law was amended. Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, recently stated in a report on the Cuban Provisional Government that "there are too many people in the cabinet who are not revolutionaries (some may even be called counter-revolutionaries); there are too many who neither approve nor disapprove of the program and policies of the Sierra Maestra; for too many, the revolution only consists of overthrowing Batista and restoring legal order, restoring the constitution, and the 1943 election law." Roca added that these elements are "people who are tied hand and foot, who believe that in order to defend against and avoid imperialist attacks, it is best to retreat, not to touch their privileged interests, and to accept their demands and instructions." The National Committee of the People's Socialist Party passed a resolution at its plenary session on May 25 and 28, which put forward a task of struggle: to strive to change the composition of the cabinet and remove the Plattists (pro-American right-wingers) and conservatives from the government.

    实现土改和其他革命法律的一项措施
    古巴内阁局部改组
    撤换外交、农业等五个部长
    本报讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴临时政府内阁决定进行局部改组。12日卡斯特罗总理主持的内阁会议决定，由原任古巴驻“美洲国家组织”的代表劳尔·罗阿接替阿格拉蒙特担任外交部长，佩德罗·米雷特接替翁伯托·索里·马林担任农业部长，何塞·纳兰霍接替路易斯·奥兰多·罗德里格斯担任内政部长，拉克耳·佩雷兹·德米雷特
  （女）接替埃伦娜·梅德罗斯（女）担任公共福利部长，塞拉芬·德萨拉特接替胡利奥·马丁内斯·帕埃斯担任卫生部长。
    哈瓦那人士认为，古巴内阁的改组，对有效地实现土地改革法和其他革命法律是一个重大的措施。被更换的内阁部长，有些人是临时政府中的比较靠右的和保守的一派。如前外交部长阿格拉蒙特不主张同苏联建立外交关系，虽然苏联已经承认了古巴临时政府。他还主张不让古巴人民社会党（共产党）参加政府。而对古巴同美国的关系则认为将是“和谐和诚恳的”。阿格拉蒙特的这种主张曾遭到了“7月26日运动”机关报有力反驳。这家报纸在1月30日发表的一篇评论中说，“与部长先生的意见相反，我们认为，古巴应该与一切愿意与古巴建交的国家建立外交和经济关系”。前农业部长翁伯托·索里·马林虽然是古巴起义部队在老根据地马埃斯特腊山区颁布的“第三号法令”的起草人，但是，他不同意触及大庄园主制度。
    新任的外交部长劳尔·罗阿6月3日在华盛顿举行的“美洲国家组织”讨论尼加拉瓜事件的会议上，反对美帝国主义利用“美洲国家组织”干涉尼加拉瓜内政，他认为尼加拉瓜国内爆发的武装斗争，不造成对任何美洲国家的威胁，因此，应该由尼加拉瓜自己去解决。后来，他又表示古巴反对调查尼加拉瓜事件，他强调指出，“美洲国家组织一定不能被喜欢玩火的人用来作为一个火药库那样”。
    另据合众国际社一则电讯中透露，古巴一些内阁成员和大地主反对最近公布的土地改革法。消息说，有些部长曾扬言要离职，除非修改土地改革法。古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加不久前在一次报告中谈到古巴临时政府时说，“内阁中有过多的人不是革命分子（有些人也许可以称之为反革命分子）；有过多的分子对马埃斯特腊山的纲领和方针既不赞成也不反对，对太多的人说来，革命只在于和只限于推翻巴蒂斯塔以及恢复法律秩序，恢复宪法和1943年的选举法”。罗加又说，这些分子是“束手束脚的人，他们认为，为了防卫和避免帝国主义的进攻，最好是退却，不触动他们的特权利益，接受他们的要求和指令”。人民社会党全国委员会在5月25日和28日全会上通过一项决议，这项决议中提出一项斗争任务：争取改变内阁成分，清除政府中的普拉特分子（亲美的右派）和保守分子。
