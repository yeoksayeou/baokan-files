Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd dispatch: According to a TASS report from Rome: The Sicilian regional assembly elections in Italy will be held on June 7th. Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti delivered a campaign speech on May 31st at a rally attended by 80,000 people in Palermo, the main city of the island.

　　Togliatti said that all of Italy is watching the election campaign on Sicily. The current situation in Italy is different from the past: the Christian Democratic Party and various right-wing parties have established an alliance, and the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party also want to establish this alliance in Sicily. This policy has brought a new crisis to Italy.

　　He pointed out that, in addition, Italy is pursuing a more rigid policy in foreign affairs. One specific manifestation of this rigid policy is that a part of Italian territory will be used to establish missile launching sites with atomic warheads to attack socialist countries.

　　Togliatti said that the Sicilians and all the Italian people absolutely do not support the Italian government's position on the missile issue.

　　Togliatti specifically pointed out that Khrushchev, during his visit to Albania, warned Italy about establishing missile bases on its territory and suggested turning the Mediterranean into a sea of peace, with no weapons of mass destruction deployed in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean.

　　Togliatti finally called on voters to vote for Communist candidates in order to establish a united force in the Sicilian regional assembly to resolutely fight for the establishment of a united autonomous government.
　　
Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS, Athens: Khrushchev's speeches in Albania have been welcomed by peace-loving members of Greek society. They believe that these speeches have opened up new prospects for Greece to develop diplomatic relations with socialist countries in the spirit of peaceful cooperation.

　　"Avgi" wrote: "The Soviet Prime Minister extended a hand of friendship to Greece in his speech in Tirana, which has aroused a profound reaction in the hearts of the Greek people."

　　The influential bourgeois newspaper "Eleftheria" wrote, "It is 'impossible' to ignore or not mention Khrushchev's speeches, because these speeches are of great importance to Greece."

　　The well-known Greek politician and leader of the Progressive Party, Markezinis, published a series of articles in "Estia," opposing the establishment of missile bases in Greece and advocating turning the Balkans into a zone of peace.

    陶里亚蒂在西西里发表竞选演说
    意大利人民反对建立美国火箭基地
    希腊公正舆论欢迎赫鲁晓夫建议
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：6月7日意大利的西西里岛将举行区议会选举。意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂5月31日在这个岛上的主要城市巴勒摩举行的一次有八万人参加的集会上发表了竞选演说。
    陶里亚蒂说，整个意大利都在注视着西西里岛上的竞选运动。目前意大利的情况同以前的情况不同了：天主教民主党和各右翼党派建立了联盟，而天主教民主党的领导人还想在西西里建立这种联盟。这种政策给意大利带来了新的危机。
    他指出，此外，意大利在外交政策方面执行着更加僵硬的方针。这种僵硬方针的具体表现之一就是：意大利的一部分领土将被用来建立原子弹头的导弹发射场以进攻社会主义国家。
    陶里亚蒂说，西西里人和全体意大利人民绝不支持意大利政府在导弹问题上所采取的立场。
    陶里亚蒂特别指出，赫鲁晓夫在阿尔巴尼亚访问的时候对意大利在自己的领土上建立导弹基地提出了警告，并且建议把地中海变为和平的海，在地中海周围的国家不设置大规模毁灭性的武器。
    陶里亚蒂最后号召选民们投票选举共产党的候选人，以便在西西里的区议会中建立团结一致的力量，为建立一个团结的自治政府而坚决斗争。
    据新华社讯　塔斯社雅典讯：赫鲁晓夫在阿尔巴尼亚发表的演说，受到爱好和平的希腊社会人士的欢迎。他们认为这些演说为希腊同社会主义国家在和平合作的精神下发展外交关系打开了新的前景。
      “黎明日报”写道：“苏联总理在地拉那的演说里向希腊伸出了友谊之手，在希腊人民的心中引起了深刻的反应。”
    有影响的资产阶级报纸“自由报”写道，“要无视或者不提赫鲁晓夫的演讲‘是不可能的’，因为这些演讲对希腊有巨大的重要性。”
    希腊著名政治家、进步党领袖马克齐尼斯在“埃斯蒂亚报”上发表了一系列文章，反对在希腊建立导弹基地，主张使巴尔干半岛变成和平地区。
