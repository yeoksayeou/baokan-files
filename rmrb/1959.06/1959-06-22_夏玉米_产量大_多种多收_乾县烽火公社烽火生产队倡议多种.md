Summer Corn: High Yield, Plant More, Harvest More.
    Fenghuo Production Team of Fenghuo Commune in Qian County Advocates Planting More

According to a report from the Shaanxi Daily, the Fenghuo Production Team of the Fenghuo Commune in Qian County has recently revised its autumn crop production increase plan, deciding to plant 700 mu of replanted corn, 75 mu more than last year; with an average yield of 540 jin per mu, an increase of 28% over last year. Among these, 140 mu are high-yield fields with an expected yield of 800 jin per mu, and 10 mu are high-yield fields with an expected yield of 2,000 jin per mu. This production team has meticulously arranged measures to increase production and has issued a proposal to fraternal production teams in Shaanxi Province to conduct a competition for high-yield corn, striving for a greater bumper harvest in the autumn.

Recently, Comrade Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, when inspecting production in the Fenghuo Production Team, encouraged the commune members to summarize their experience, learn modestly, and strive for a greater bumper harvest in the autumn. This instruction was immediately supported by the commune members, who immediately held a meeting for specific discussions and decided to expand the replanting area from 75% to 90%; and to expand the corn planting area from 600 mu to 700 mu.

During the discussion, everyone also put forward many ways to unleash labor potential, such as running public canteens, improving tools, and so on. Commune member Liu Guimei suggested: "We can use furrow openers to ditch and irrigate the cornfields, which is five times faster than using iron shovels. If all 700 mu of corn use furrow openers, we can save more than 260 workdays." Everyone said his suggestion was good. The production team decided to use furrow openers for all ditching this year and proposed to manufacture a large number of hand-pushed sprayers, which could save more than 1,600 workdays in total.

    夏玉米　产量大　多种多收
    乾县烽火公社烽火生产队倡议多种
    据陕西日报消息　乾县烽火公社烽火生产队，最近重新修订了秋田增产计划，决定种回茬玉米七百亩，比去年多种七十五亩；平均亩产五百四十斤，比去年增产28％。其中一百四十亩大面积丰产田，亩产八百斤，十亩高额丰产田，亩产两千斤。这个生产队已细致地安排了增产措施，并已向陕西省各兄弟生产队发出倡议，开展丰产玉米的竞赛，争取秋田的更大丰收。
    最近，陕西省委第一书记张德生同志在烽火生产队检查生产的时候，曾勉励社员：总结经验，虚心学习，争取秋田更大的丰收。这一指示立即得到社员的拥护，他们马上开会具体讨论，确定把复种面积由75％扩大到90％；玉米播种面积由六百亩扩大到七百亩。
    在讨论中，大家还提出了许多发挥劳动潜力的办法，比如办公共食堂、改良工具等等。社员刘桂梅建议说：“可用开沟器给玉米地开沟灌水，比用铁锨开沟灌快五倍。七百亩玉米都用开沟器，就能节省二百六十多个劳动日。”大家都说他的意见好。生产队便决定今年全部用开沟器开沟，并提出大量制造手推喷雾器，共可节省一千六百多个劳动日。
