Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Jialie:

    A train, followed by a convoy of cars, carrying songs, carrying laughter, carrying the ambitions of more than 150 Tibetan students from the Central Institute for Nationalities going to work in Tibet, crossed the Black River, crossed the Kunlun Mountains, and traveled thousands of miles from Beijing to Lhasa to participate in the great cause of shattering the shackles of slavery that the Tibetan people are about to begin.

    When these Tibetan youths, around twenty years old, left Beijing, Chairman Mao received them, and central leaders spoke with them. They were determined to dedicate their youth to the cause of the Tibetan people's liberation. As soon as they boarded the train in Beijing, they became active in every carriage, helping the conductors sweep the floors and wipe the windows, and serving tea and water to the passengers. The loudspeaker frequently broadcasted Tibetan songs they sang. A girl named Naxi's rendition of "Yarlung Tsangpo River" was particularly applauded by the passengers. She sang:

    The Yarlung Tsangpo River flows eastward for thousands of miles,
    North and south of the grasslands, cattle and sheep are everywhere,
    The banks of the Tsangpo River are fertile soil,
    The tributaries and valleys are farms,
    Snow-capped mountains are full of treasures,
    This is our beloved motherland's border.

    These lively and happy Tibetan youths had tasted bitter lives in their childhood. Most of them came from poor farmers, herdsmen, and artisan families. Some of them had been house slaves, beggars, and vagrants, deeply suffering from the torment and persecution of the feudal lords. The scars left on them by the feudal lords were still there, and the hatred of many relatives who died at the hands of the feudal lords was still fresh in their minds. In the childhood fates of these Nima (sun), Dawa (moon), Tsering (long life, happiness), and Gyatso (ocean, symbolizing a bright future) there was never any realization of the light and happiness symbolized by their names. Only after the sun of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao shone on their hometowns did light and happiness descend upon them. Many of them began their happy lives in the primary schools established after the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and gradually progressed to the Central Institute for Nationalities; others were sent to the highest institutions of higher learning for ethnic minorities for further study and development after they had started working. Despite their different experiences, after three to five years of study in the united and friendly Central Institute for Nationalities, they had respectively reached the level of cultural knowledge from primary school to high school and secondary vocational schools, and their class consciousness had also improved. They understood that the root cause of their ancestors' painful lives lay in the oppression and exploitation of the feudal serf system, and that only through democratic reform could they achieve true liberation. They also understood that Tibet could only prosper and progress in the big family of the motherland and under the leadership of the Party. Because of this ideological understanding, many of them gloriously joined the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League during their studies and became proletarian fighters.

    During the journey, two girls both named Tsering Drolma were particularly active. Along the way, they talked with the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the frontier or the cadres and workers of all ethnic groups participating in the construction of the frontier, thanking them for their help and expressing their determination. Little Tsering Drolma is from Dege County in the Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province and is nineteen years old this year. When she was ten years old, the People's Liberation Army came to the Jinsha River, and she and several small partners who picked firewood and cut grass threw themselves into the arms of the People's Army and became a small singer in the army's cultural troupe. After joining the army, the leaders and comrades taught her to read and sing. During the foot march, her backpack was always hung on the shoulders of her older brothers and sisters; when there were yaks, she rode on the back of the yaks. She grew up in the revolutionary ranks, and at the age of fourteen she came to the Central Institute for Nationalities from the army. Now she is a probationary party member, can read newspapers and magazines, and speaks fluent Mandarin and Lhasa dialect.

    Big Tsering Drolma is from Lhasa and is one year older than Little Tsering Drolma. She was a house slave for a feudal lord since she was a child. Her family originally had cattle and sheep, and life was still passable. Later, somehow the cattle and sheep became the herdsman's, and her father died in grief. She and her second sister were forced to become the herdsman's house slaves, inseparable from whips and curses. One winter when she was thirteen years old, one day the master rode out on horseback to visit relatives, and she followed barefoot carrying the young master, who was as big as she was. Her feet were chapped and bleeding, her legs were so tired that they could not bend, and she fell, causing the master's son to fall. The master tied her hand to the horse's tail and dragged her for hundreds of miles. Later, little Drolma, who had been tortured beyond recognition, escaped. But the past Tibet was the same everywhere, and she couldn't find a place to fill her stomach there either, and she spent two years with a full meal and an empty stomach. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, little Drolma came to work as a nanny in the home of a Han cadre, and from then on she began to feel the warmth of the human world. The Han cadre treated her like a little sister, told her some revolutionary truths, and in 1954 brought her to Beijing and introduced her to the Central Institute for Nationalities. After entering school, she made good friends with sisters of all ethnic groups and all kinds of books, gradually increased her class consciousness, and joined the Communist Youth League and the Communist Party one after another.

    During the long journey from Beijing to Lhasa, these Tserings and Drolmas, whose origins were difficult and whose future was bright, cared for and helped each other like brothers and sisters. When staying overnight, there were many people and few beds, and the male students always fought to sleep on the floor. Some people who brought less luggage found themselves covered with other people's thick fur coats when they woke up on cold nights on the plateau.

    After arriving in Lhasa, their relatives and friends, carrying butter tea and holding sweets and pastries, sat with them on the lawn to talk, danced in circles, and at the same time poured out their grief over the loss of their families and the desolation of their fields. Losang Kaijue, the secretary of the Party's temporary branch on the journey, was in great pain because he could not find the two children left behind by his deceased sister as soon as he arrived in Lhasa. His sister died under the whip of the reactionary feudal lord, and his sister's two young children were forcibly occupied and enslaved by the master. Now the children's whereabouts are unknown, and it is unknown whether they are dead or alive. Some other students were also saddened by not being able to find their relatives. The hatred of these Tibetan students is just a drop in the deep sea of blood and hatred of more than 1.1 million Tibetan people. The flames of hatred are burning in their hearts. When they left Lhasa to go to their work posts, they expressed their determination to the Party, saying: Under the leadership of the Party, we will stand firm, fight resolutely, wash away all the dirty things that hinder the progress of Tibetan society, and let Tibet advance along the glorious and brilliant road of democracy and socialism.

    一片丹心报祖国
    ——随中央民族学院藏族学员进藏记
    新华社记者　赵家烈
    一列火车，接着是一队汽车，载着歌声，载着欢笑，载着中央民族学院到西藏工作的一百五十多名藏族学员的雄心壮志，跨过黑河，越过昆仑山，从北京奔驰万里来到拉萨，参加西藏人民即将开始的粉碎奴隶枷锁的伟大事业。
    这批二十岁上下的藏族青年，在离开北京的时候，毛主席接见了他们，中央首长同他们谈过话，他们决心要为西藏人民的解放事业献出自己的青春。从北京一踏上火车，他们就活跃在各个车厢里，帮助乘务员扫地抹窗，给旅客端茶送水，扩音器里不时传出他们演唱的西藏歌曲。一个叫娜喜的姑娘演唱的“雅鲁藏布江”，特别受到乘客的喝采，她唱道：
    雅鲁藏布江滚滚东流万里长，
    草原南北几千里遍地是牛羊，
    藏布江两岸是沃土，
    支流河谷是田庄，
    雪山到处蕴宝藏，
    这是亲爱的祖国边疆。
    这批活泼快乐的藏族青年，在他们的童年时代却饱尝了悲苦的生活。他们绝大部分出身于贫苦农牧民和手工业者的家庭，有的本人就曾经是家奴、乞丐和流浪儿，深受过农奴主的折磨和迫害，农奴主打在他们身上的伤痕犹在，许多亲人死在农奴主手里的仇恨记忆犹新。在他们这些尼玛（太阳）、大娃（月亮）、泽仁（长寿、幸福）、嘉错（海洋，象征前途远大）们童年的命运里，从没有兑现过这些名字所象征的光明和幸福。只有在共产党和毛主席的太阳照到了他们的家乡以后，光明和幸福才降到了他们的身上。他们当中的许多人，是在西藏和平解放后办的小学里，开始过着幸福的生活，一步步地升入到中央民族学院的；还有一些人是在参加了工作以后，党为了进一步培养他们，把他们送到各民族最高学府学习深造的。尽管他们的经历是怎样不同，但在团结友爱的中央民族学院里，经过三、五年的学习以后，他们已从原来的文盲分别达到了小学到高中以及中等专业学校的文化知识水平，阶级觉悟也都有了提高。他们懂得了祖祖辈辈痛苦生活的根源在于农奴制度的压迫和剥削，只有经过民主改革，才能获得真正解放，也懂得了西藏只有在祖国大家庭中，在党的领导下，才能繁荣进步。由于有了这样的思想认识，他们之中的许多人在学习期间光荣地参加了共产党或共青团，成为无产阶级的战士。
    在旅途中，两个名字都叫泽仁卓玛的姑娘特别活跃。他们一路上与同车的驻守边疆的人民解放军官兵或参加边疆建设的各族干部和工人交谈，感谢他们的帮助，并表达自己的决心。小泽仁卓玛是四川省甘孜藏族自治州德格县人，今年十九岁。在她十岁那年，解放军来到金沙江边，她和几个拾柴割草的小伙伴一起投入了人民军队的怀抱，成为部队文工队的一名小歌手。参加部队后，首长和同志们教她识字唱歌。在徒步行军的时候，她的背包总是挂在哥哥姐姐们的肩上；有牦牛时，她又骑在牦牛的背上。她就这样在革命队伍里成长起来，十四岁那年她由部队来到了中央民族学院。现在她已是一名预备党员，能阅读报纸杂志，说一口流利的普通话和拉萨话。
    大泽仁卓玛是拉萨人，比小泽仁卓玛大一岁，自小给农奴主当家奴。她家里原来也有牛羊，生活还过得去，后来不知怎的牛羊成了牧主的了，父亲忧愤地死去，她同二姐被迫成了牧主的家奴，同鞭打咒骂形影不离。在她十三岁那年冬天，有一天主人骑着马外出走亲戚，她赤着脚背着和她一般大的小少爷跟着走。脚冻裂了口，流着血，腿疲乏得拐不过弯，摔倒了主人的儿子，主人便把她的手绑在马尾巴上拖着走了上百里地。后来，被折磨得不像一个人的小卓玛逃出来了。但是过去的西藏到处是一样，那里也找不到一个可以饱肚的地方，她饱一顿饥一顿地度过了两年岁月。西藏和平解放后，小卓玛来到一个汉族干部家当保姆，从此她才开始感到人间的温暖。这个汉族干部把她当成小妹妹，给她讲述一些革命道理，1954年又把她带到北京，介绍她进入了中央民族学院。入学以后，她同各民族姐妹和各种书本交上了好朋友，逐渐提高了阶级觉悟，并先后加入了共青团和共产党。
    在从北京到拉萨的万里行程中，这些来路艰辛、前途平坦的泽仁、卓玛们，像兄弟姐妹一样，互相关心，互相帮助。晚上住宿时，人多床铺少，男同学们总是争着睡地铺。一些行李带少了的人，在高原严寒的夜间睡醒时，却发现自己身上加盖了别人厚厚的皮大衣。
    到拉萨后，他们的亲戚朋友，提着酥油茶，拿着糖果点心，同他们在草坪上围坐着谈心，围着圈歌舞，同时又向他们倾诉着家破人亡、田园荒芜的悲痛。旅途中的党的临时支部书记洛桑开觉一到拉萨，就因找不到他的亡妹留下的两个孩子，心里很痛苦。他的妹妹死在反动农奴主的皮鞭下，妹妹的两个幼小的孩子被主人强占和奴役着，现在孩子音信杳无，死活未知。其他有些学员也因找不到自己的亲人而悲愤。这些藏族学员们的仇恨，不过是一百一十多万西藏人民血海深仇中的一滴。仇恨的怒火在他们心中燃烧，他们在离开拉萨走向工作岗位的时候，都向党表示决心说：在党的领导下，站稳立场，坚决斗争，把一切阻碍西藏社会前进的肮脏东西冲洗得干干净净，让西藏沿着光辉灿烂的民主和社会主义的道路前进。
