Recently, the Sichuan operas "Zhi Zhongshan," "The Legend of the White Snake," "The Orphan of Zhao," and the modern drama "Two Women Red Army Soldiers" staged in Chongqing have become more and more exciting and moving with each performance. Although the number of performances has been increasing, the audience has continued to grow.

Among these dramas, "The Legend of the White Snake" has been revised the most. This Sichuan opera, loved by the masses, is quite high in ideological and artistic value, but its structure was not tight enough, and the characterization of the main characters, Bai Niangniang and Xu Xian, was not complete enough. The Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theater has made this play a key project for reorganization and improvement, conducting one or two dozen studies. Famous veteran actors who have performed "The Legend of the White Snake" for many years, such as Hu Yuhua, Qiong Lianfang, and Jiang Shangfeng, participated in the research. During the research and revision, even a scene, a musical passage, or an actor's movement was repeatedly pondered and refined, making the play more perfect and full of the powerful appeal of a great tragedy.

"Zhi Zhongshan," performed by the Chongqing Beibei Sichuan Opera Troupe, is adapted from the story of Yue Yangzi angrily rejecting the Zhongshan soup recorded in "Romance of the Eastern Zhou Dynasties." This play has been carefully considered and revised eight times by professors and associate professors from Southwest Normal College and the actors. The whole play concentrates many fascinating traditional performing techniques of Sichuan opera, such as "face changing," coupled with the superb performing arts of actor Zou Xichi, who plays the leading role of Yue Yangzi. As a result, the quality of the performance of this play has become higher and higher. Although it has been performed more than two hundred times in recent years, it is still sold out every time.

While exploring and reorganizing traditional dramas, Chongqing has also explored how modern dramas can inherit and carry forward the traditions of Sichuan opera art. The Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theater summarizes the performance experience every time it performs a modern drama. In addition to the troupe's repeated rehearsals of "Two Women Red Army Soldiers," the original author, Chen Qitong, personally guided the Sichuan opera actors in rehearsals. The Sichuan opera actors also visited veteran soldiers who participated in the guerrilla war and learned bayonet techniques from the People's Liberation Army soldiers, so that they could be more naturally combined with the dance movements in the drama.

    传统剧现代剧并重
    川剧节目精益求精
    最近，重庆上演的川剧传统剧“治中山”、“白蛇传”、“赵氏孤儿”和现代剧“两个女红军”等剧目，一次比一次演得精彩动人，虽然场次不断增加，观众却越来越多。
    这些剧目中，修改次数最多的是“白蛇传”。这出受群众喜爱的川剧，思想性和艺术性都相当高，但结构还不够严密，原本对主角白娘娘和许仙的性格的刻划还不够完整。重庆市川剧院把这出戏作为重点整理、提高的剧目，进行过一、二十次的研究。曾多年演出“白蛇传”的著名老演员胡裕华、琼莲芳、姜尚峰等都参加研究。在研究修改时，连一个场口、一节音乐、或演员的一个身段，都经过反复琢磨，一再锤炼，使得这幕戏更臻完善，富有大悲剧气氛的强烈感染力。
    重庆北碚川剧团演出的“治中山”，是根据“东周列国志”所载乐羊子怒餟中山羹的故事编成。这出戏经西南师范学院的教授、副教授们和演员合作，先后经过八次细致的斟酌修改。全剧集中了川剧中“变脸”等好些引人入胜的传统表演手法，加上有精湛表演艺术的演员邹西池担任主角乐羊子，这样，使这出戏的演出质量就越来越高。尽管近年来曾经陆续上演过二百多场，现在仍然是场场满座。
    在发掘整理传统剧目的同时，重庆市还对现代剧如何继承和发扬川剧艺术的传统进行了探讨。重庆市川剧院每演出一幕现代剧都要总结一下演出经验。“两个女红军”除剧团反复排练以外，原著的作者陈其通曾亲临指导川剧演员排练。川剧演员们还访问参加过游击战争的老战士，和向解放军战士学习劈刺动作，使之能够比较自然地和戏剧中的舞蹈身段相结合。
