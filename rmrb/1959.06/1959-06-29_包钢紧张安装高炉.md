Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, June 28th. The equipment installation project in the Baotou Steel Blast Furnace District has entered a tense stage.

　　The gas duct pipes and gas rising pipes, gas descending pipes, with a diameter of more than two meters, are connected together. From the top of Blast Furnace No. 1, they slant down like a giant dragon and connect to the gravity dust collector next to it. Welding workers are welding the last few pipe seams on the gas down-twisting pipe crotch, more than sixty meters above the ground.

　　On the ground of the plant area, large gas pipelines and cold air pipelines meander and extend all the way to the boiler workshop and blower station of the nearby thermal power station. Five sections of the nine-section cooling wall of the blast furnace body have been installed. The grate of the three hot blast stoves has also been installed, and the furnace builders are stepping up bricklaying in the furnace body. The equipment in the blower station, No. 5 pump station, casting machine room, and several substations are either almost installed or are being installed.

　　The civil engineering of the blast furnace silo trestle and several transfer stations, belt conveyor corridors and other charging systems is nearing completion and will soon begin equipment installation.

　　Two tall tower cranes are constantly moving back and forth between the blast furnace, hot blast stove, gas scrubbing tower and other magnificent building complexes, lifting and lowering from time to time. Yu Changyu, the leader of the fitter team of the Metal Structure Company No. 2 and a Communist Party member, has been standing in front of the two gas scrubbing towers all day these days, braving the scorching heat, directing the large crane to hoist the gas pipes to high altitude piece by piece. Some time ago, when their team was installing hot blast stove grates in the furnace body section, they closely cooperated with the hoisting workers and scaffolders, adopted a large-scale assembly line operation method, and completed the installation of the grates of the three hot blast stoves at a very fast speed. Now they will adopt this method to strive to complete the installation of the seventy-ton tower front aerial gas pipeline before the end of June. During this period, the various work section teams of the Metal Structure Company No. 2 have done an excellent job and have been leading the red flag emulation campaign in the blast furnace district. Under the slogan of installing equipment as soon as it arrives, they have generally improved labor organization, adopted the methods of assembling, combining, and overall hoisting, and have continuously created many excellent achievements in rapid installation.

　　Yang Wei, the general manager of Baotou Steel, has frequently visited the blast furnace construction site in the past half month, working with the party committee secretaries, managers, and technicians of various construction units to grasp project quality, construction progress, and collaboration, and trying every means to ensure that the projects in the blast furnace district meet the requirements of being more, faster, better, and more economical.

    包钢紧张安装高炉
    新华社包头28日电　包钢高炉工区的设备安装工程已经进入紧张阶段。
    直径两公尺多的煤气导对管和煤气上升管、煤气下降管连在一起，从一号高炉炉顶像一条巨龙似地斜插下来，接在旁边的重力除尘器上面，焊接工人正在离地面六十多公尺高的煤气下扭管裤裆叉上，焊接最后几道管缝。
    厂区地面上的粗大的煤气管道和冷风管道，蜿蜒曲折，一直通到附近热电站的锅炉车间和鼓风机站。高炉本体九段冷却壁已经安好了五段。三座热风炉的炉篦子也都安好了，筑炉工人正在炉体里加紧砌砖。鼓风机站、五号泵站、铸铁机室和几个变电所的设备，有的安装差不多了，有的正在安装。
    高炉料仓栈桥和几个转运站、皮带运输通廊等上料系统的土建工程，目前已接近完工，不久也将开始安装设备。
    两台高大的塔式吊车，终日在高炉、热风炉、煤气洗涤塔等宏伟的建筑群中间进进退退，时举时落。金属结构公司二队钳工小组长、共产党员于长玉，这几天整天站在两座煤气洗涤塔前面，冒着酷暑，指挥着大吊车一件一件地往高空吊装煤气管。前些时候，他们小组在炉体工段安装热风炉篦子时，曾经同吊装工、架子工密切配合，采取大流水作业法，用很快的速度完成了三座热风炉炉篦子的安装任务，现在他们还要采取这种办法，争取在6月底以前，完成七十吨重的塔前空中煤气管道安装任务。这一时期，金属结构公司二队各工段小组，都干得很出色，一直走在高炉工区红旗竞赛运动前面。他们在设备随到随安装的口号下，普遍改进了劳动组织，采取了拼组合、整体吊装的方法，连续创造了许多快速安装的优异成绩。
    包钢总经理杨维，近半月来经常亲临高炉工地，同各施工单位的党委书记、经理、技术人员一道，抓工程质量，抓施工进度，抓协作，想尽一切办法，保证高炉工区的工程达到多快好省的要求。
