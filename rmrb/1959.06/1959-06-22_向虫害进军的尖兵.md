Recently, this reporter visited the Cotton Insect Work Team of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Tanqiao Commune, Jiangling County, Hubei Province. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, relying on the masses, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, they have continuously launched mass movements to prevent and control overwintering insect pests and early spring insect pests, establishing a red banner of "early prevention and early treatment, clever prevention and clever treatment." Not long ago, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture held an on-site conference on cotton pest control here, and promoted the advanced pest control experience of this commune throughout the province.

Preparing for Early Prevention and Early Treatment

The Great Leap Forward last year liberated people's minds, and the Cotton Insect Work Team also changed its old practices. Last winter, when insects entered hibernation as usual, all members of the Cotton Insect Work Team voluntarily gave up their plans to return to Beijing for the New Year and continued to stay in the cotton-growing area, throwing themselves into new work that was even more intense than usual. Now, their new slogan is: actively complete tasks, drive the development of science, and strive for everyone to become a versatile expert who is both specialized and broad. Last winter, they stayed in the Anyang cotton-growing area in Henan Province. In January of this year, they moved to Yaoxin Management Area of Tanqiao Commune on the banks of the Yangtze River, where they established a new home. Now, various simple scientific experiment setups have been established in front of their residence. Every day, male and female team members set off separately, going deep into the fields and among the masses to investigate and understand local insect pest data from various aspects. Sometimes, they spend the whole day drilling into forests, bamboo gardens, or crouching in weeds and bushes, searching everywhere for various insect pupae, egg masses, larvae, and adults, bringing them back for various observation experiments to explore the overwintering life patterns and habits of various pests, and to provide reliable intelligence data for taking timely and effective control measures.

The Bugle Call of Attack Sounds

Around the Spring Equinox, the weather cleared and warmed, and the willows turned green. People in the cotton-growing area are busy preparing the land and applying fertilizer, welcoming the planting season. At this time, cotton pests also wake up from hibernation with the warming climate. Cotton aphids lay eggs on wild pepper trees and Toona sinensis, Hibiscus syriacus trees, and will hatch into small aphids, turning into winged aphids and migrating to cotton fields. Red spiders, deeply hidden in weeds such as Duchesnea indica, Urtica fissa, and Solanum lyratum during the cold winter, will also turn into adults to lay eggs and reproduce. The Spodoptera litura and Agrotis ipsilon larvae, which seriously damaged cotton last autumn, also secretly survived the winter under the fallen leaves covering forests, bamboo gardens, and cotton fields, and are蠕蠕 moving, attempting to burrow into the ground to pupate, and then turn into insects and fly out...

No matter how cunning the enemies are, and how small their changes are in early spring, they cannot escape the sharp eyes of the scouts. The Cotton Insect Work Team promptly sent express reports of the insect situation discovered from various sources to all parts of the country; and reported in detail to the local Party committee. After joint research, the Yaoxin Management Area launched an emergency mobilization of all commune members on March 15, proposing the attack slogan of "Seize the opportunity when the insects are just beginning to wake up, adopt active offensive tactics, and eliminate them outside the large fields."

At the beginning of the battle, it was opposed by some people with conservative ideas. They discussed one after another: "Cotton has not been planted yet, what insects are we treating? This is confusing priorities and reversing the main and secondary tasks"; some production team leaders said: "Currently, there is still a shortage of labor for land preparation and fertilization. Where is the manpower to be spared to treat insects?"; still others said: "Now that we haven't even seen the shadow of the insects, we are blindly busy. Anyway, we will have to treat insects in the future, so why bother doing this!" The best way to break through this barrier is to see the site and calculate the overall account. With the help of the Cotton Insect Work Team, the entire management area held two physical exhibitions of overwintering insect pests, and organized small on-site exhibitions in each production team, using local materials; while holding the exhibitions, they calculated three accounts for the masses: that is, the comparison account of labor used for early prevention and early treatment versus future large-field treatment and the comparison account of expenditures, and the comparison account of benefits. They cited many simple and easy-to-understand examples, such as a female Spodoptera litura laying 500 eggs in the first generation, followed by the second generation, the third generation, the fourth generation, with each generation multiplying in multiples; then eliminating one female moth now is equivalent to eliminating tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of larvae in the cotton field in the future. Many people were surprised and convinced and said: "If you don't look, you don't realize; if you don't calculate, you don't understand; once you look and calculate, your heart will be bright."

The entire management area immediately took action. Each production team made appropriate arrangements for labor. Except for those who insisted on staying put for tilling the fields, transporting fertilizer with ox carts, and making nutrient pots, all of the remaining 1,600+ laborers launched a blitz to treat insects. Even the elderly, old women, and children who rarely worked usually volunteered to join the ranks, and the actual number of insect-treating people surged to more than 2,500. This blitz only lasted for four days. According to statistics, more than 550,000 easily pest-infested harmful trees such as wild pepper trees, Toona sinensis, and Hibiscus syriacus were cut down; more than 4,000 mu of empty fields were plowed and the sods of graves, barren fields, field ridges, and ditches were removed, and the fallen leaves in bamboo gardens and forests were swept away; combined with these activities, 770,000 dan of fertilizer were accumulated. In addition, widespread pest control treatment was carried out on cotton warehouses, flower-drying tools, and cotton firewood piles. For timber trees such as mulberry, Broussonetia papyrifera and willows, most were brushed with whitewash, appearing snow-white, looking like a spring snow scene from afar; every household also swept the front and back of their houses, the corners of the village, and the corners of the fields clean, making people feel refreshed.

The Moth's "Night Meal Gathering"

In mid-April, the commune members of the Yaoxin Management Area were busy planting cotton on a full scale. At this time, the Cotton Insect Work Team, based on reliable reconnaissance intelligence, predicted that the first batch of enemies of cotton—the adult Agrotis ypsilon—would soon appear in large numbers, laying eggs and multiplying. They immediately suggested that the commune and management area quickly launch a blitz to lure and kill Agrotis ypsilon moths with sugar syrup.

At first, some of the masses still did not believe it. Coupled with the fact that it was a dark night without moonlight at the time, they could not see their fingers when they stretched out their hands, and they thought that how could the moths find the food that people had prepared for them? Even the party branch secretary Wang Guixin was also half-believing. The Cotton Insect Work Team decided to conduct an on-site experiment for the cadres and masses to see first. According to the chemotactic (also known as trophic) characteristics of this kind of moth, which likes to eat sugar, vinegar and alcoholic foods in the pre-oviposition period, they mixed sugar juice with wine and vinegar and water and placed them in plates, scattered in the fields at dusk, and found that an average of fifteen or sixteen moths were induced in each plate the next morning. They happily pulled the party branch secretary Wang Guixin to see. The Party Branch immediately convened a meeting of the branch secretaries of each production team and made mobilization arrangements. More moths were induced on the second and third days. One day, an average of more than 130 moths were induced in each plate, and they displayed the moth-inducing plates on the edge of the field and at the road crossings. When the masses went to work, they all gathered around to watch, and everyone was amazed.

Next, a mass movement of 100,000 sugar syrup moth traps was launched throughout the commune. The fields were filled with rich "night meals" for the insects, covering the land with nets. In the Yaoxin Management Area alone, about one million Agrotis ypsilon moths were lured and killed in a week. Many people said with emotion: If we hadn't come up with this good method, if so many moths had laid their eggs and turned into Agrotis ypsilon and burrowed into the ground, it would have been a major disaster for the tender cotton seedlings!

Sending Insects to the Door, a Long Show of Affection

When the Cotton Insect Work Team first came to Yaoxin Management Area, the local commune members saw this group of newcomers, running east and west every day, and if they caught a few small insects, they would take them home and raise them as if they had gotten a treasure egg, which was a bit strange. Sometimes, they walked past and heard some people mocking behind their backs: "They really have nothing to do after eating. In the past, I only heard of people who liked to grow flowers and raise birds, but now there are some people who specialize in raising caterpillars in busy times." Later, after the practical education of the two battles of overwintering insect control and sugar syrup moth trapping, the public opinion of the masses changed greatly, and they suddenly realized: "It turns out that this group of people really has the ability to predict things like a god."

Now, people often run to the Cotton Insect Work Team to visit their various novel experiments, hoping to learn more new tricks for preventing and controlling insect pests. Once, an old man from the Yaoxin Production Team personally sent more than a dozen large Agrotis ypsilon larvae and carefully handed them over to the Cotton Insect Work Team, smiling and instructing: "Send them to you to raise and study." Sometimes, people from far away also called to report that an unknown insect had been discovered and asked the work team to send someone to investigate and study it as soon as possible. Many leading cadres of the management area and production teams now regard the work team as good teachers and helpful friends, and often take the initiative to find them to study the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests together. Recently, the production teams are continuing to rush to make a large number of sugar solutions and various indigenous pesticides, and are launching a large-scale struggle against various diseases and insect pests.

II. When the first batch of cotton enemies—adult Agrotis ypsilon—were laying eggs and multiplying, they used sugar syrup to trap Agrotis ypsilon moths. This event greatly educated the masses, and everyone was amazed.
III. After the practical education of the two battles of overwintering insect control and sugar syrup moth trapping, the masses all realized the necessity of actively preventing and controlling pests. As a result, the work team received the support of the masses, and people often came to learn from experience and report the activities of pests.

    向虫害进军的尖兵
    曲一凡　文　娄溥义　张自申　马兆仁　画
    最近，记者在湖北省江陵县滩桥公社，访问了中国科学院昆虫研究所的棉虫工作队。他们在当地党委的领导下，依靠群众，土洋结合，连续开展了防治越冬虫害和早春虫害的群众性运动，树立了“早防早治，巧防巧治”的一面红旗。不久以前，湖北省农业厅曾在这里召开了全省防治棉花虫害的现场会议，在全省范围内普遍推广了这个公社的先进治虫经验。
    为早防早治作准备
    去年的大跃进，解放了人们的思想，棉虫工作队也改变了旧的作法。去年冬天当虫子照例进入冬眠的时候，棉虫工作队的全体人员自动放弃了回北京过年的打算，继续留在棉区，投入了比平常更加紧张的新的工作。现在，他们提的新口号是：积极完成任务、带动科学的发展，争取人人都要成为又精又博的多面手。去年冬季，他们留在河南省安阳棉区，今年1月间，迁移到长江边上的滩桥公社耀新管理区，在这里建立了新的家。现在，在他们的住所门前，已经建立起设备简单的各种科学试验。每天，男女队员们分头出发，深入田间，深入群众，多方面侦察和了解当地虫害资料。有时，他们整天地钻进树林、竹园里，或俯身在杂草、灌木丛中，到处搜寻挖掘各种虫蛹、卵块、幼虫和成虫，带回来进行各种观察试验，探索各种害虫的越冬生活规律和习性，为采取适时有效的防治措施，提供可靠的情报资料。
    进攻的号角响了
    春分前夕，天晴气暖，杨柳垂青。棉区人们正在紧张地整地施肥，迎接播种季节。这时，棉花的害虫也随着气候的转暖，从冬眠中苏醒过来。棉蚜虫在野花椒和栋绿、木槿树上产卵，将孵化出小蚜虫，变成有翅蚜向棉田迁飞。寒冬中深藏在蛇莓、破布袄、癞可马叶等杂草丛中的红蜘蛛，也将变为成虫产卵繁殖。去年秋天曾严重危害棉花的斜纹夜盗蛾和桦条夜蛾幼虫，也偷偷在树林、竹园和棉田的落叶复盖下熬过了寒冬，正在蠕蠕移动，企图钻入地下化蛹，再变成虫飞出……。
    尽管敌人如何狡猾，初春时期它们的变化又很微小，可是却逃不出侦察兵的锐利目光。棉虫工作队一面把多方侦察的虫情，及时地向全国各地发出快报；一面向当地党委详细做了汇报。经过共同研究，耀新管理区在3月15日向全体社员进行了紧急动员，提出“抓住虫子刚开始苏醒的这个时机，采取主动进攻的战术，把它们消灭在大田以外”的进攻口号。
    战斗开始时，遭到一些思想保守的人的反对。他们纷纷议论说：“现在棉花未种，治什么虫，这是缓急不分，主次倒置”；有的生产队长说：“当前整地施肥尚感劳力不足，哪有人力抽去治虫”；还有人说：“如今连虫子影儿还没见就瞎忙一通，反正将来还得治虫，何必多此一举！”要突破这一关，最好的办法是看现场，算大账。在棉虫工作队帮助下，全管理区举办了两次越冬虫害的实物展览会，又分别在各生产队就地取材，组织小型的现场展览；在举行展览的同时，他们向群众算了三笔账：即早防早治与将来大田防治所用人工的对比账和开支对比账、效益对比账。他们列举许多浅显易懂的实例，如一只雌性的斜纹夜盗蛾，第一代产卵五百个，接着又是第二代，第三代，第四代，代代加番繁殖；那末现在消灭一只雌蛾，就等于将来在棉田消灭几万、几十万只幼虫。许多人惊奇而信服地说：“不看不觉、不算不明；一看一算，心里就亮堂了。”
    全管理区马上行动起来，各生产队对劳动力进行了适当安排，除了整田、用牛车运肥和制造营养钵的人坚持不动以外，其余一千六百多劳动力全部突击治虫。连平常很少出工的老翁、老婆婆和儿童也自报奋勇加入了行列，实际治虫人数猛增到两千五百多人。这一突击战只进行了四天，据统计砍除野花椒、栋绿、木槿等易被害虫寄生的害树五十五万多根，翻耕空田和铲除坟荒、田埂、沟道的草皮，打扫竹园、树林中的落叶等，合计有四千多亩，结合这些活动还积了七十七万担肥料。此外，还对棉花仓库、晒花工具、棉柴堆普遍做了除虫处理。对桑、构和杨柳等用材树木，大多用石灰水粉刷得一片雪白，远远看去犹如初春雪景；家家户户还把屋前屋后、村边地角，打扫得干干净净，使人心清目爽。
    飞蛾的“夜餐聚会”
    4月中旬，耀新管理区的社员们正忙着全面播种棉花。这时，棉虫工作队又根据可靠的侦察情报，预计棉花的第一批敌人——地老虎的成虫，最近就将大量出现，产卵繁殖。他们立即建议公社和管理区迅速发动一次利用糖浆诱杀地老虎飞蛾的突击运动。
    起初，有些群众还是不相信，加上当时正值没有月光的黑夜，伸手不辨五指，认为飞蛾怎么会找到人们为它准备的食料呢？就连总支书记王贵新也是半信半疑。棉虫工作队决定先由自己实地试验给干部和群众看。根据这种蛾子在产卵前期喜食糖、醋和酒类食物的趋化性（亦称趋食性）特点，他们把糖汁和酒、醋掺水混合放在盘里，黄昏时候分散放在田野里，第二天早晨发现平均每盘诱到十五六只蛾子。他们高兴地拉着总支书记王贵新去看。党总支马上召开各生产队支部书记会议，进行了动员布置。第二、三天诱到的蛾子更多了。有一天平均每盘诱到一百三十多只，他们就在田边和大路口把诱蛾盘陈列起来，群众出工时都围上来参观，个个惊奇不已。
    接着，就在全公社掀起了群众性的十万盏糖浆诱蛾运动，田野里到处给虫子摆开丰盛的“夜餐”，遍布天罗地网。仅是耀新管理区，在一周间就诱杀地老虎蛾一百万只左右。许多群众感动地说：要不是想出这个好办法来，如果让这许多的蛾子下了蛋变出地老虎，钻进地里，可真是棉花嫩苗的一场大灾难！
    送虫上门情意长
    当棉虫工作队刚来到耀新管理区的时候，当地社员们看到这伙新来的人，每天东跑西钻，如果捉到几只小虫，就如同得了宝贝蛋似的，还把它带回家养起来，总有些奇怪。有时，他们走过去，听到背后有的群众嘲弄地说：“真是吃了饭没事干。过去只听说有爱好修花养鸟的人，如今大忙时光还有些人专爱养毛毛虫的哪。”后来经过越冬治虫和糖浆诱蛾两次战役的实际教育，群众舆论大变了，他们恍然大悟：“原来这批人还真有神机妙算的本领哩。”
    现在，经常有人跑到棉虫工作队来参观他们的各种新奇试验，渴望多学一些防治虫害的新窍门。有一次，耀新生产队一位老大爷，亲自送来十几条大地老虎的幼虫，小心地交给棉虫工作队，笑嘻嘻地嘱咐说：“送你们养起来，研究研究。”有时，远处的群众还打电话来，报告又发现了一种不知名的虫子，请工作队赶快派人前去调查研究。管理区和生产队的许多领导干部，现在把工作队当做良师益友，时常主动找他们一起研究防治病虫害的事。最近，各生产队正在继续赶制大量的糖稀和各种土农药，大张旗鼓地继续同各种病虫害展开斗争。

    一、中国科学院昆虫研究所棉虫工作队的同志们来到滩桥公社，一面向群众宣传早防早治棉蚜的好处，一面即开始到处挖掘虫蛹。
    二、在棉花第一批敌人——地老虎的成虫产卵繁殖的时候，他们就利用糖浆诱捕地老虎飞蛾。这一事例，给群众很大教育，个个惊奇不已。
    三、经过越冬治虫和糖浆诱蛾两次战役的实际教育，群众都了解到积极防治害虫的必要。于是，工作队得到了群众的支持，经常有人来学习经验，和报告害虫的活动情况。
