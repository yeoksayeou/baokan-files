New Surge in Strike Struggles in Western Europe
Commentator of this newspaper

    A powerful wave of strike movements is surging in some capitalist countries in Western Europe. The Italian seamen's strike, which began on June 9, has paralyzed fifteen shipping routes connecting Italy with foreign countries, turning various Italian seaports into dead ports. On June 10, Italian textile workers and 60,000 civil servants also went on strike in many cities. Starting from June 15, 80,000 bank employees across Italy also began a strike demanding higher wages and better living conditions. In France, despite the despicable decision of the de Gaulle government to conscript railway workers and adopt high-pressure policies to deal with the nationwide strike of state-owned railway workers; not only have the three railway unions leading the strike issued statements, angrily protesting against the government's actions and expressing their determination to defend their right to strike, but also workers in the French metallurgical, electricity, coal mining, shipping, and public transportation sectors are extremely indignant, unanimously expressing their support for the struggle of their railway worker brothers. In Britain, 200,000 printing workers began a strike on the evening of the 17th, demanding increased wages and shorter working hours. At the same time, thousands of dockworkers and auto workers have also joined the strike struggle. Even in Spain, under the fascist rule of Franco, the broad masses of the people are enthusiastically responding to the nationwide strike against the dictatorship. From Naples to Paris, from London to Madrid, economic and political strike struggles have become a prominent fact in the current social life of Western European capitalist countries and are affecting the political situation in these countries.

    The wave of strikes in Western European countries illustrates the turbulent socio-economic conditions in these countries. Although most of the strike movements are directly aimed at improving economic living conditions, this demand still reflects much deeper social causes. Due to following the US's policy of arms expansion and war preparation, the burden on the working people of Western European countries is becoming heavier and heavier. The domestic market is narrow, and social purchasing power is constantly declining. The establishment of Western European economic groups represented by the "Common Market" has led to further development of internal contradictions in Western European countries. In order to create favorable competitive conditions, capitalists and ruling classes in various countries are trying their best to intensify the exploitation and squeezing of the working people. All this cannot but make the living conditions of the working people in Western European countries deteriorate day by day. Although the ranks of the unemployed have reached unprecedented figures, many people are still facing the danger of being laid off and reduced working hours (correspondingly reducing income). And the increase in taxes and the continuous rise in prices have made more people reduce their actual income. In France, due to the de Gaulle government's intensified colonial war of aggression against Algeria and its pursuit of the status of an atomic power, the people are required to tighten their belts even further. This policy of the ruling classes in Western European countries has aroused great dissatisfaction among the working people of various countries. The strike struggles that are rising one after another in these countries are precisely the result of this socio-economic background.

    The upsurge of strike movements in Western European countries once again demonstrates the powerful force of the working people in these countries in their struggle for living rights and social rights, and their unity in the struggle. Their actions show that they are by no means willing to be arbitrarily exploited and squeezed by monopoly capital. Nor are they willing to bear the consequences of the government's reactionary political and economic policies. Although the ruling classes of Italy and France are now adopting despicable means, attempting to oppress and deceive workers into returning to work, or deprive them of their right to strike, this conspiracy has been seen through. The striking workers in Western European countries have received the support of the working people at home, they are determined to stick to their demands, and they will surely gain new victories.

    西欧罢工斗争的新高涨
    本报评论员
    一个强有力的罢工运动的浪潮，正在西欧的一些资本主义国家中汹涌澎湃。从本月9日开始的意大利海员大罢工，已经使连结意大利本国和国外的十五条航线陷于瘫痪，使意大利各个海口变成为死港。6月10日，意大利纺织工人和六万国家机关职员也在许多城市举行罢工。从15日起，意大利全国八万名银行职员也开始了要求提高工资和改善生活条件的罢工。在法国，尽管戴高乐政府发布了征调铁路工人的卑劣决定，采取高压政策对付全国国营铁路工人的罢工；但是，不仅领导这次罢工的三个铁路工会已经发表声明，愤怒抗议政府的这种手段，并表示要坚决维护他们的罢工权利，而且法国冶金、电力、煤矿、航运和公共交通等部门工人也极为义愤，一致表示要支持铁路工人兄弟的斗争。在英国，二十万印刷工人已从17日晚开始要求增加工资和缩短工作时间的罢工。同时还有数千名码头工人和汽车工人也卷入了罢工斗争。甚至在佛朗哥法西斯统治下的西班牙，广大人民也热烈响应反对独裁的全国性罢工。从那不勒斯到巴黎，从伦敦到马德里，经济性和政治性的罢工斗争，已经成为西欧资本主义国家目前社会生活中的一个突出的事实，并正在对这些国家的政局发生影响。
    西欧国家的罢工浪潮，说明了这些国家社会经济状况的动荡不安。虽然多数的罢工运动是以改善经济生活条件为直接目的的，但这种要求仍然反映了深刻得多的社会原因。由于追随美国的扩军备战政策，西欧各国劳动人民的负担越来越重。国内市场狭窄，社会购买力不断下降。以“共同市场”为代表的西欧经济集团的建立，引起了西欧各国内部矛盾的进一步发展。为了造成有利的竞争条件，各国的资本家和统治阶级就竭力加紧对劳动人民的剥削和榨取。这一切，都不能不使西欧各国劳动人民生活状况日益恶化。失业队伍尽管已经达到空前的数字，但是还有许多人正在面临着被解雇和减少工作时间（相应地就减少收入）的危险。而捐税增加和物价的不断上涨，又使更多的人减少自己的实际收入。在法国，由于戴高乐政府加紧进行侵略阿尔及利亚的殖民战争和追求原子大国地位的政策，人民被要求更进一步勒紧裤带。西欧各国统治阶级的这种政策，引起了各国劳动人民的极大不满。这些国家此伏彼起的罢工斗争，正是在这种社会经济背景下产生的。
    西欧各国罢工运动的高涨，再一次表现了这些国家的劳动人民为争取生活权利与社会权利而斗争的强大力量，和他们在斗争中的团结一致。他们的行动说明，他们决不甘心处于被垄断资本任意剥削和榨取的地位。他们也不愿意承担政府反动的政治和经济政策的恶果。尽管现在意大利和法国的统治阶级正在采取卑劣的手段，企图压迫和欺骗工人复工，或者剥夺他们的罢工权利，但是这种阴谋已被识破。西欧各国的罢工工人得到了国内劳动人民的支持，他们决定坚持自己的要求，他们一定会得到新的胜利。
