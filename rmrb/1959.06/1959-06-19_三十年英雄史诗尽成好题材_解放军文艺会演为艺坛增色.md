The reporter Zhou Zemin reports: Some people compare the Second Art Performance Conference of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to a grand garden with thousands of purples and reds, and hundreds of flowers blooming. This is indeed a very vivid generalization. Since the opening of the conference on June 1, in the past sixteen days, twenty-five professional and amateur performance units from all over the country, from thousands of miles of coastal defense to thousands of miles of borderlines, have performed a total of two hundred and sixteen programs. These programs are not only mostly new works by officers, soldiers and art workers since last year, with a clear spirit of the times and characteristics of the troops, but also have a wide range of themes, rich and colorful, and from various different angles, use various different art forms to praise the great revolutionary struggle and the boiling reality of life.

	Dance Dramas and Spoken Dramas Bloom Anew
Dance drama is a very young art form in China's art world. It is only in the past two years that art workers in the troops have begun to use this form for artistic creation. However, because they resolutely implemented the Party's literary and artistic policy, worked hard in artistic practice in using the dance drama form to reflect major revolutionary historical themes and realistic struggle life, and made bold attempts in creating Chinese national dance drama, they have achieved gratifying results. In this performance, large and medium-sized dance dramas that have been warmly welcomed by the audience have emerged one after another, such as "Butterfly Lovers," "Five Red Clouds," and "Wila Girl." The emergence of these dance dramas vividly reflects the increasingly prosperous and flourishing scene of dance drama art in the troops.
The songs, dances, and spoken dramas performed this time are all characterized by reflecting modern themes and have strong realistic significance. The ideological and artistic qualities of the works have also been greatly improved compared to the past. In terms of music, dance, and folk art, the programs of each unit have formed their own characteristics based on the life themes and local colors of their respective regions or units. There are "Artillery Blockade of Jinmen Island," "True Gold in the Fire Hu Dean," "Frontline Interview Notes," "War Song," "Sisters-in-Law Guard the Coast Under the Moon," and "Mid-Autumn Night on the Frontline" that reflect the front-line combat life, as well as "Chairman Mao Comes to Our Company," "Naval Training," "Why is it Glorious to be a Soldier," "Jumping Horse," "We Are Both Cooks," and "Old Sailor" that reflect the life of the troops and the glorious deeds of supporting the socialist construction of the motherland. In addition, there are "Flying Capture of Luding Bridge," and "Red Flag Planted on Highland 424" that reflect combat stories, "Drum Dance," "Da Nang Dance," "Uyghur Singing," "Sichuan Folk Songs," and choruses of Yi and Tibetan soldiers with strong local ethnic colors, as well as the grand symphony "Motherland Symphony" and acrobatics, which are truly a hundred flowers blooming, colorful and graceful.
In terms of spoken drama, the multi-act dramas "South China Sea War Song" performed by the Guangzhou Military Region Drama Troupe and "On the 38th Parallel" by the Fireline Art Troupe are both relatively successful. "On the 38th Parallel" quite profoundly expresses the infinitely deep fighting friendship between the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people, and exposes the vile conspiracy of the US-Lee bandit army to deliberately sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement, which is a very outstanding comedy. "South China Sea War Song" quite realistically and vividly recreates the heroic epic of our army overcoming the difficulties of crossing the sea to fight, defeating the enemy's armored fleet with wooden boats, and liberating Hainan Island. The whole drama is magnificent, and has made creative achievements in stage work. Especially the scene on Commander Ding's command ship on the sea of ​​Qiongzhou Strait can be said to be a wonderful artistic conception. When the curtain opens, the lights in the theater gradually dim, and the sky is covered with dark clouds. On the stage, waves are rolling, the blue waves are surging, and the red light of artillery fire is flashing. Commander Ding stood on the swaying sailboat, commanding thousands of troops to cross the strait.... This magnificent and vivid picture allows the audience to break through the limitations of the stage space, as if they are on the turbulent sea of ​​fierce battle, and experience the thrilling great battle with the heroic commanders and fighters. This scene plays a good role in highlighting the theme of the whole drama. It vividly recreates the great spirit of our army defeating the remaining Chiang bandits who temporarily occupied the sea and air superiority in the Hainan Island liberation campaign, and the indomitable ocean in front of the audience. It is a relatively novel and outstanding artistic treatment of spoken dramas that express war themes.

	Mass Art is Colorful
The performances of the amateur delegations in this performance can be described as a hundred flowers blooming and colorful. Their programs are rich, the themes are broad, the forms are novel, and they are lively and vigorous. They are closely integrated with the current struggles and work, and the atmosphere of life is particularly strong. Many programs have also made new creations in terms of creation and artistic performance.
Poetry recitations "Unforgettable Voyage", "Remembering General Yang Jingyu" and "Story of the Fireman" aroused unanimous praise from the audience in the capital. The authors of these poems are all amateur art lovers. Most of the performers are also officers and soldiers of the troops who are appearing on stage for the first time. The author of "Unforgettable Voyage" is Lieutenant Mechanic Mei Mingliang and others. It describes the inner passion of sailors of a certain ship after a voyage with Chairman Mao with the lyrical tone of "Thousands of rivers return to the sea, sunflowers face the sun, the hearts of sailors, always remember Chairman Mao, a happy voyage makes us unforgettable for life..." The authors of "Remembering General Yang Jingyu" are Lieutenant Assistant Sun Shaoji and others. They wrote the deep feelings of the people of Northeast China for the Anti-Japanese League heroes through the memory of the people of an ordinary rural village in Northeast China for General Yang Jingyu. The authors of "Story of the Fireman" are Lieutenant Assistant Yan Tingrui and others. They successfully shaped the image of the great internationalist fighter, the hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, with a combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. It unfolds the thrilling scene of the "Songgufeng Battle" through a Korean old man telling the "Story of the Fireman" to his granddaughter: Songgufeng is burning in the fire, a team of Volunteer soldiers guarding the mountain is running out of ammunition and food, they are covered in fire, singing "Burn, we are the diamond in the fire, use the fire that the enemy burns on us, to burn the enemy to death at Songgufeng..."
The heroes rushed into the enemy group and perished with the enemy.
The white-haired Korean old man and the innocent granddaughter appeared in front of us again. Under the dim starlight, the child listened intently, she really wanted to see where the Fireman was? The old man pointed to the sky and said affectionately: "Look, in the sky above the north, those bright stars, that is the Fireman, they are still looking at Pyongyang-Beijing."
The performances of these poems have all broken through the form of general poetry recitation, creatively combining solo recitation, collective recitation, musical accompaniment and performance organically, so that the relatively monotonous poetry recitation has received a strong dramatic effect and enhanced the power of emotion.

    三十年英雄史诗尽成好题材
    解放军文艺会演为艺坛增色
    本报讯　记者周泽民报道：有人比喻中国人民解放军第二届文艺会演大会，是一个万紫千红、百花盛开的大百花园。这确是一个很形象的概括。会演从6月1日开幕以来，十六天中，来自全国各地千里海防、万里边疆线上的二十五个专业和业余的演出单位，共演出了二百一十六个节目。这些节目，不但绝大部分都是部队官兵和文艺工作者去年以来的新作，具有鲜明的时代精神和部队特点，而且题材广泛，丰富多采，从各个不同角度，运用各种不同的艺术形式，讴歌了伟大的革命斗争和沸腾的现实生活。
        舞剧话剧新花怒放
    舞剧，在我国艺坛上是一支很年青的艺术花朵。部队文艺工作者，只是近两年来才开始运用这种形式进行艺术创作。但是，他们由于坚决贯彻了党的文艺方针，在运用舞剧形式反映重大革命历史题材和现实斗争生活等方面，努力地进行了艺术实践，并且在创造我国民族舞剧方面，作了大胆的尝试，取得了可喜的收获。这次会演，相继涌现出来受到观众热烈欢迎的大、中型舞剧就有“蝶恋花”、“五朵红云”、“萎拉姑娘”等。这些舞剧的出现，生动地反映了部队舞剧艺术日益兴旺、繁荣的景象。
    这次演出的歌舞和话剧，全都以反映现代题材为特色，具有强烈的现实意义。作品的思想性和艺术性较之过去也大有提高。在音乐舞蹈和曲艺方面，各部队的节目已以本地区或本部队的生活题材和地方色采形成各自的特色。这里有表现前线战斗生活的“大炮封锁金门岛”、“烈火真金胡德安”、“前沿访问记”、“战歌”、“姑嫂月下守海防”、“火线仲秋夜”，也有表现部队生活和支援祖国社会主义建设的光荣事迹的“毛主席来到咱们连”、“海上练兵”、“当兵为什么光荣”、“跳木马”、“咱们俩都是炊事员”、“老水兵”等。另外，还有表现战斗故事的“飞夺泸定桥”、“红旗插上四二四高地”，有地方民族色彩很浓的“鼓舞”、“打馕舞”、“维语演唱”、“四川民歌”和彝族、藏族战士的合唱，以及大交响乐“祖国交响乐”和杂技等，真是百花齐放，艳丽多姿。
    话剧方面，广州部队话剧团演出的“南海战歌”和火线文工团的“三八线上”两个多幕剧，都比较成功。“三八线上”相当深刻地表现了志愿军和朝鲜人民间无限深厚的战斗友谊，并且揭露了美李匪军蓄意破坏朝鲜停战协定的卑鄙阴谋，是一个甚为出色的喜剧。“南海战歌”则相当真实而生动地再现了我军克服渡海作战的重重困难，以木船战胜敌人的装甲舰队、解放海南岛的英雄史诗。全剧气魄宏伟，并且在舞台工作上有创造性的收获。特别是在琼州海峡海面丁军长指挥船上的一场戏，可以说是绝妙的艺术构思。幕启，场内灯光渐暗，乌云密布天空。舞台上波涛滚滚，碧浪滔滔，炮火红光闪闪。丁军长屹立在颠簸摇晃的帆船上，指挥千军万马横渡海峡……。这个气势磅礴的生动画面，使观众突破了舞台空间的限制，宛如置身于波涛汹涌的激战的大海之上，和英勇的指战员一起经历着惊心动魄的伟大战斗。这个场景，对于突出全剧主题，起了良好的作用。它把解放海南岛战役我军战胜暂时占有海空优势的残余蒋匪，和难以驯服的海洋的伟大气魄，形象地再现于观众面前，是表现战争题材的话剧，比较新颖出色的一种艺术处理。
        群众文艺万紫千红
    这次会演，各个业余代表队的演出，可以说是百花齐放万紫千红。他们节目丰富，题材广阔，形式新颖，生动活泼。紧紧地结合了当前的斗争和工作，生活气息特别浓郁。不少节目还在创作和艺术表演方面，有了新的创造。
    诗朗诵“难忘的航行”、“怀念杨靖宇将军”和“火人的故事”，引起首都观众的一致赞扬。这几首诗的作者都是业余文艺爱好者。表演者也大多是头次登台的部队官兵。“难忘的航行”的作者，是少尉机电长梅明亮等。它以“千条江河归大海，朵朵葵花向太阳，水兵的心啊，永远怀念毛主席，一次幸福的远航，使我们终身难忘……”的抒情笔调，描写了某舰水兵和毛主席在一起的一次远航之后的内心激情。“怀念杨靖宇将军”的作者，是中尉助理员孙绍基等，他们通过东北一个普通农村的人民对杨靖宇将军的怀念，写出了东北千百万人民对抗联英雄的深沉感念。“火人的故事”的作者，是中尉助理员颜廷瑞等。他们以革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的手法，成功地塑造了伟大的国际主义战士——中国人民志愿军的英雄形象。它通过朝鲜老人向小孙女讲“火人的故事”，展开了惊心动魄的“松骨峰战斗”情景：松骨峰在烈火中燃烧，一队坚守山头的志愿军战士弹尽粮绝了，他们全身披火，高唱着“燃烧吧，我们是火中的金刚，用敌人烧在我们身上的烈火，把敌人烧死在松骨峰……”。
    英雄们扑向敌群，和敌人同归于尽了。
    我们面前又出现了须发斑白的朝鲜老人和天真烂漫的小孙女。淡淡的星光下，孩子听的出了神，她真想看看火人在那儿？老人用手指着天空，深情地说：“你看，北边上空，那些亮晶晶的星星，那就是火人，他们还在望着平壤——北京。”
    这几首诗篇的表演，都突破了一般诗朗诵的形式，创造性地把单人朗诵、集体朗诵、音乐伴奏和表演有机地结合起来，使比较单调的诗歌朗诵，收到了强烈的戏剧效果，增强了感人力量。（附图片）
