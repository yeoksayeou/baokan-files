Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th June: The light industry and commercial departments of Wuhan City are cooperating closely and making comprehensive plans for the production of daily industrial goods.

In the past half-month or so, the chemical, textile, enamelware, and pharmaceutical light industry departments and commercial departments of Wuhan City, under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, discussed the current production and market supply of daily necessities. The commercial departments, based on the rapid increase in social purchasing power, proposed plans to increase the quantity and variety of daily necessities. The industrial departments, by tapping production potential and increasing raw material sources, decided to expand the production of daily necessities. The civil affairs and commercial departments in each district of the city investigated the production of street industries and handicraft cooperatives under their jurisdiction and in contact with them, helped them formulate production plans, improve equipment, and increase the production of small daily commodities.

The industry and commerce departments first paid attention to increasing the production of daily necessities that are in high demand, seasonal, and lacking in variety and specifications. Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Station and relevant factories recently decided to increase the output of forty-three kinds of goods, such as shoelaces, shoe buckles, shoe eyes, trouser hooks, plain thread, and pointed women's socks, which are currently in great demand on the market. The market demand for mosquito nets is high, but the production capacity is insufficient. The wholesale station actively helped weaving factories modify their machines to rush-weave mosquito net yarn. It is estimated that more than 187,000 mosquito nets can be produced in June. The Hardware, Transportation, and Electrical Appliance Company and the industrial department jointly arranged the production of 226 kinds of civilian hardware, transportation, and electrical materials. More than 190 kinds have been contracted with factories and put into production one after another. Among them, more than 80 kinds of commodities, such as thousand-layer locks, household fuses, aluminum wire-made noodle skimmers, and chemical fire extinguishers, used to rely on supplies from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places. The production capacity of daily necessities such as scissors, pot shovels, zippers, and small iron hammers is also being expanded.

At present, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to allocate steel, nan bamboo, wood, and other raw materials from the materials supply department to factories in Wuhan and other regions to increase the production of daily necessities. The city's commercial departments are also preparing to further develop waste product recycling in order to recover more waste materials for factories.

    工商部门密切协作统筹安排
    武汉扩大日用百货生产
    新华社武汉16日电　武汉市轻工业部门和商业部门密切协作，统筹安排日用工业品生产。
    最近半个多月，武汉市的化工、纺织、搪瓷和医药等轻工业部门和商业部门，在中共武汉市委领导下，讨论了当前日用品生产和市场供应问题。商业部门根据社会购买力迅速提高的情况，提出了增加日用品的数量、花色品种的计划；工业部门挖掘生产潜力和增加原料来源，决定扩大日用品的生产。全市各区的民政和商业部门，调查了所管辖和联系的街道工业和手工业合作社的生产情况，帮助它们制订生产计划，改进设备，增产日用小商品。
    工商部门首先注意增加需要量大、季节性强和品种规格不全的日用品的生产。武汉市百货批发站和有关工厂，最近决定增加鞋带、鞋扣、鞋眼、裤钩、素线和尖足女袜等四十三种商品的产量，这些都是目前市场上需要大量供应的。市场上对蚊帐的需要量大，但是生产能力不足，这个批发站就积极帮助织布厂改装机器，赶织蚊帐纱，6月份预计能生产蚊帐十八万七千多顶。五金交通电工器材公司和工业部门共同安排二百二十六种民用五金交电器材的生产，目前已经和工厂签订合同、先后投入生产的有一百九十多种。其中有千层锁、家用保险丝、铝丝做的面捞子和化学灭火弹等八十多种商品，过去是依靠上海、广州等地供应的。剪刀、锅铲、拉链和小铁锤等日用品的生产能力，也正在扩大。
    目前，中共湖北省委已决定从物资供应部门调拨钢材、楠竹、木材等原料材料，供给武汉等地区的工厂增产日用品。全市商业部门也准备进一步开展废品回收业务，以便回收更多废旧物资供给工厂。
