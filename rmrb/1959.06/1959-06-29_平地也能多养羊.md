    More Sheep Can Be Raised on Plains
    Wang Tiqiang

Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, has been paying attention to developing sheep raising in the plains, opening up a new path for developing animal husbandry in the vast plains of our country. The experience of Yuzhong County in raising sheep in the plains proves that adopting this method of raising sheep does not take up land or feed, nor does it take up labor; it can greatly increase high-quality fertilizer, greatly increase the income of commune members, and increase the supply of meat, wool, and hides to urban and rural areas.

In northern China, some farmers in the plains, in addition to pastoral and semi-pastoral areas, also have the habit of raising sheep. However, this matter has not received universal and sufficient attention. Therefore, the sheep raising industry in the plains has developed very little. In the south, farmers in many provinces such as Zhejiang and Yunnan have always raised some sheep sporadically, which proves that sheep can also be raised in the south. However, also because of the lack of attention to this matter, there are very few sheep raised in the south. The plains area of Yuzhong County is an arid area with not abundant water and grass, but it can still raise many sheep; then, in the vast plains, especially the southern plains, where water and grass are so abundant and the feed problem is easy to solve, it is even more possible to raise a large number of sheep. The only question is whether or not this matter is given enough attention.

At present, the mutton needed by large and medium-sized cities is mostly transported over long distances from pastoral and semi-pastoral areas; this requires a lot of transportation capacity, and sometimes the supply cannot be guaranteed in time. Raising more sheep in the plains and suburban areas of cities can avoid this situation. This is a good way to increase the supply of meat in addition to vigorously developing pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese. Now, the season has entered summer, and water and grass are very good everywhere, which is a good time for raising sheep, and the opportunity must not be missed. It is hoped that people's communes in the plains will take up the sheep raising business, quickly find ways to purchase sheep if they do not have any, and strengthen the grazing, management, and breeding work of those who already have sheep.

    平地也能多养羊
    王体强
    甘肃省榆中县注意在平川地区发展养羊事业，为我国广大平川地区发展畜牧业打开了一个新门路。榆中县川区养羊的经验证明，采用这种办法养羊，既不占土地和饲料，又不占劳动力；既可以大量增加优质肥料，又可以大量增加公社社员收入，增加城乡肉食供应和毛、皮供应。
    在我国北方，除牧区、半牧区以外，平川地区一些农民也有养羊的习惯。但是，这件事没有受到普遍的足够的重视。因此，平川地区养羊事业很少发展。在南方，浙江、云南等很多省区的农民，历来都零星喂养着一些羊，这证明在南方也是可以养羊的。但是，也因为对这件事不重视，南方养羊也很少。榆中县川区是个干旱地区，水草并不富足，还能养很多羊；那末，在广大的平川地区，特别是南方平川地区，水草那样富美，饲草问题很容易解决，就更有可能大量养羊。问题只在于是不是重视这件事情。
    现在，大中城市需要的羊肉，大都是远距离地从牧区、半牧区调运来的；这样就要多费许多运输力，有时还不能保证及时供应。平川地区、城市郊区多养羊，就可以避免发生这种情况。这是在大力发展猪、鸡、鸭、鹅以外增加肉食供应的一种好办法。现在，时令已进入夏季，各地水草很好，正是养羊的好时节，机不可失。希望川地的人民公社都把养羊事业抓起来，没有羊只的迅速设法购买，已有羊只的加强放牧、管理、繁殖工作。
