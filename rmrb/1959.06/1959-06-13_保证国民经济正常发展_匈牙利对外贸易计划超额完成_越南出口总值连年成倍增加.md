    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 12th: Since Hungary reversed its long-standing trade deficit last year and balanced its international payments, it has overfulfilled its export plan by 15.4% in the first quarter of this year. For the first time since liberation, it has overfulfilled its export plan to capitalist countries by 22%.

    Last year, Hungary overfulfilled its export plan by 12%, an increase of 40% compared to 1957.

    In the first quarter of this year, Hungary's import plan was also completed well, which ensured the normal development of its national economy. With the accelerated development of the national economy, the increase in investment, and the rapid growth of exports, Hungary plans to import 50% more machinery and industrial equipment this year than stipulated in the Three-Year Plan for 1959. This year, Hungary will import more new machines than in any year since liberation. This will make it possible to accelerate the improvement of Hungary's industrial technical level, improve industrial equipment, and further improve product quality.

    Foreign trade has a great impact on the development of Hungary's national economy. In Hungary's national income, the volume of foreign trade accounts for 28% of the total income. Currently, Hungary has trade relations with ninety countries and has trade agreements with all socialist countries and thirty-seven capitalist countries. Between the two world wars, Hungary only had trade relations with a few neighboring countries. After liberation, due to the development of the national economy, its foreign trade volume at the end of 1958 had more than doubled compared to before liberation. In 1950, Hungary's exports to countries outside Europe accounted for only 6.3% of its total exports, while in 1958 this proportion had increased to 17%.

    The development of economic mutual assistance and cooperation between Hungary and socialist countries is a strong guarantee for the smooth development of Hungary's foreign trade. Hungary's trade with socialist countries accounts for more than 70% of its total foreign trade, with trade with the Soviet Union accounting for about 30%. Hungary's trade relations with China have also developed greatly in recent years. Apart from European countries, Hungary's trade volume with China ranks first.

    Since liberation, due to the rapid development of industry, the structure of Hungary's export commodities has also undergone great changes. In 1949, machinery and industrial equipment accounted for only 17.4% of Hungary's exports, while agricultural products and food industry products accounted for 43.2%. In 1957, the proportion of machinery and industrial equipment in the total export volume had increased to 38.8%, while agricultural products and food industry products accounted for only 26.2%. Moreover, due to the vigorous development of industrial sectors such as telecommunications equipment, precision instruments, high-voltage equipment, and diesel locomotives, Hungary's traditional export commodities have recently undergone great improvements in technology, quality, and variety, and have been widely welcomed in the international market.

    This newspaper reports: Hanoi News: In recent years, the foreign trade of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has developed very rapidly. If the total export value in 1955 is counted as 100, it was 287 in 1956, 570 in 1957, 706 in 1958, and the planned target for 1959 is 1161.

    In 1958, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam overfulfilled its export plan, and there were thirty-two new export products. In 1959, Vietnam's export plan target will increase by 63% compared to last year, which is nearly twice the total export value of South Vietnam in 1958.

    In addition to establishing trade relations with socialist countries, Vietnam has now established trade relations with twelve countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

    保证国民经济正常发展
    匈牙利对外贸易计划超额完成
    越南出口总值连年成倍增加
    新华社布达佩斯12日电　匈牙利的对外贸易自从去年改变了长期以来存在的差逆情况，使国际支付得到平衡以来，在今年第一季度内，又以15.4％超额完成了出口计划，并且解放以后第一次超额22％完成了向资本主义国家的出口计划。
    去年，匈牙利超额12％完成了出口计划，比1957年提高了40％。
    今年第一季度，匈牙利的进口计划也完成得很好，这保证了它的国民经济的正常发展。随着国民经济的加速发展、投资的增加和出口额的迅速增长，今年，匈牙利计划进口的机器和工业设备将比三年计划规定的1959年的进口额多50％。今年匈牙利进口的新机器将比解放以来任何一年都要多。这样，便有可能加速提高匈牙利的工业技术水平和改善工业装备，进一步改善产品的质量。
    对外贸易对匈牙利国民经济的发展有很大影响。在匈牙利的国民收入中，对外贸易额占了总收入的28％。目前，匈牙利同九十个国家有着贸易关系，它与全部社会主义国家和三十七个资本主义国家订有贸易协定。在两次世界大战之间，匈牙利只和几个邻国有贸易关系。解放后，由于国民经济的发展，1958年年底它的对外贸易额已比解放前增加了两倍多。在1950年匈牙利向欧洲以外的国家输出的商品只占它的总出口额的6.3％，而1958年这个比重已经提高到17％。
    匈牙利同社会主义国家的经济互助合作的发展是匈牙利对外贸易顺利发展的有力保证。匈牙利与社会主义国家的贸易占其对外贸易总额的70％以上，其中与苏联的贸易约占30％。匈牙利与中国的贸易关系几年来也有了很大的发展。除了欧洲的国家以外，匈牙利与中国的贸易额占第一位。
    解放以来，由于工业的迅速发展，匈牙利出口商品的结构也发生了很大变化。1949年，在匈牙利出口的商品中，机器和工业设备只占17.4％，农产品和食品工业产品则占43.2％。而在1957年，机器和工业设备的出口额在总出口额中所占的比重已经增长为38.8％，农产品和食品工业产品仅占26.2％。而且，由于电讯器材、精密仪器、高电压设备和柴油机车等工业部门的大力发展，最近两年匈牙利的这些传统的出口商品在技术上、质量上和花色品种方面都有了很大的改善，在国际市场上普遍地受到了欢迎。
    本报讯　河内消息：越南民主共和国几年来，对外贸易发展非常迅速，如以1955年的出口总值为一百计算，1956年为二百八十七，1957年为五百七十，1958年为七百零六，1959年的计划指标为一千一百六十一。
    1958年，越南民主共和国超额完成了出口计划，出口的新产品有三十二种。1959年越南的出口计划的指标将比去年增加63％，相当于南越1958年出口总值的近二倍。
    除了同社会主义国家建立贸易关系以外，越南现在还同亚、非、欧三洲的十二个国家建立了贸易关系。
