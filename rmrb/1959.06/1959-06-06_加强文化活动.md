Editorial Postscript

    Strengthening Cultural Activities
    The Beijing theater scene has been very active recently, which is a good phenomenon for enriching the cultural life of the masses.
    Cultural entertainment is an indispensable part of life. A good movie or a good play can make people feel happy, raise their awareness, and encourage their enthusiasm, which is very beneficial to the cause of socialist construction.
    Cultural entertainment is a legitimate consumption in personal life. Watching movies and dramas, appreciating music and art, visiting scenic spots and historical sites, as well as bathing, haircuts, and other aspects of daily life, are not only necessary but also beneficial. Therefore, cultural and sports activities should be vigorously developed.

    加强文化活动
    北京戏剧界最近十分活跃，这是丰富群众文化生活的好现象。
    文化娱乐，是生活中不可缺少的部分。一部好电影或一场好戏，能使人舒畅心情，提高觉悟，鼓舞干劲，这对社会主义建设事业是大有益处的。
    文化娱乐是个人生活的正当消费，如看电影、戏剧，欣赏音乐美术，游览名胜古迹，以及日常生活中的洗澡、理发等等，都不只是必需的，而且是有益的。因此，应当大力开展文化体育等活动。
