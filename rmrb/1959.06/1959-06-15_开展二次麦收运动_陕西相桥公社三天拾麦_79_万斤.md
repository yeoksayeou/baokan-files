Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Telegram: The Xiangqiao People's Commune in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, organized a ten-thousand-person wheat-gleaning team and launched a second wheat harvesting campaign, collecting more than 790,000 jin of wheat in three days.

The 127,000 mu of wheat in Xiangqiao Commune was completely harvested by June 6th after a seven-day blitz. In order to recover the scattered wheat ears, the commune's summer harvest command immediately launched a second summer harvest campaign to ensure that every grain returns home and a bumper harvest is achieved. Cadres from various management areas and production teams went among the masses to conduct ideological mobilization. They calculated an account with the commune members, pointing out that if ten jin per mu were scattered in the field, the entire commune would lose 1.2 million jin of wheat for nothing. After this calculation, the commune members all agreed that the second wheat harvest was very important, and therefore actively participated in the wheat-gleaning team. In order to encourage commune members to collect more wheat and clean it up thoroughly, the commune appropriately increased the work points originally stipulated for wheat gleaning. All production teams strengthened their organizational leadership, assigned areas of responsibility, conducted inspections and acceptance, and stipulated that land to be planted with autumn crops should be gleaned first, followed by land not planted with autumn crops, and that scattered wheat ears near the roadside should be gleaned first to avoid damage from vehicles and people. When gleaning wheat, teams were organized by production team, forming a horizontal line to glean the land piece by piece. Some women and children also used brooms and dustpans to sweep up scattered wheat grains on the edges of the fields and roadsides. Everyone's morale was very high.

    开展二次麦收运动
    陕西相桥公社三天拾麦79万斤
    据新华社西安电　陕西临潼县相桥人民公社组织万人拾麦队伍，开展第二次麦收运动，三天拾回小麦七十九万多斤。
    相桥公社的十二万七千多亩小麦，经过七天突击，到6月6日已经全部割完。为了把掉在地里的麦穗拣回，公社夏收指挥部发动全社立即开展第二次夏收运动，保证切实做到颗粒还家，丰产丰收。各管理区、生产队的干部，都到群众中进行思想动员，他们和社员算了一笔账，如果每亩地里抛撒十斤，全公社就要白白损失一百二十万斤小麦。经过算账，社员们都认为第二次麦收工作很重要，因此纷纷参加拾麦队伍。为了鼓励社员多拾麦、拾干净，公社把原来规定拾麦的工分适当提高。各生产队都加强了组织领导，分片包干，进行检查验收，并且规定先拾种秋的地，后拾不种秋的地，先拾靠近路边的抛失麦穗，以免车轧、人踏糟蹋掉。拾麦时，以队为单位组织拾麦队伍，排成横队，逐块拣拾。部分妇女和孩子还拿着扫帚、簸箕在场边、路边打扫撒下的麦粒。大家情绪很高。
