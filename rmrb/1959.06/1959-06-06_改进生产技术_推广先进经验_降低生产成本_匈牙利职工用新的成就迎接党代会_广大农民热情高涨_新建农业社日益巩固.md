    Improve Production Technology, Promote Advanced Experience, Reduce Production Costs
    Hungarian Workers Greet the Party Congress with New Achievements
    Broad Masses of Peasants Display Great Enthusiasm, Newly Established Agricultural Cooperatives Increasingly Consolidated
    (Dispatch from our newspaper in Budapest, June 5) The workers and staff of Hungarian factories and enterprises are launching a labor emulation campaign, using new achievements to greet the Seventh Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party, which will be held at the end of November this year.
    The workers of the Lenin Steel Plant have already overproduced 5,000 tons of steel plate, and now they have proposed a guarantee to increase production by another 3,000 tons of steel plate. The Haza Textile Factory originally planned to increase production by 12 million forints for the whole year. Due to the workers' efforts to improve technology and operating methods, they have increased production by 5.5 million forints so far.
    The Csepel Petroleum Factory has fully adopted the workers' rationalization proposals and has over-processed 1,000 tons of crude oil.
    Recently, fifty larger factories in Budapest summarized the preliminary results of the labor emulation campaign over the past two months. According to statistics, the tasks presented as gifts have generally been overfulfilled. The plan to increase labor productivity in April was overfulfilled by 2%. The average production value of each worker in the Budapest Metal Equipment and Machine Tool Factory was 13% higher than planned. The average production value of each worker in the Budapest Gaebani Textile Factory increased by 11.2% compared to the original plan. The production of export products has generally been overfulfilled by 4%-5%.
    Simultaneous with the labor emulation campaign, workers across Hungary are paying attention to saving raw materials and reducing production costs, and have achieved great results.
    The Danube Steel Plant in Stalin City currently uses more than 100 kilograms less coke per ton of steel produced than originally planned. The Diósgyőr Metallurgical United Factory can save 100 kilograms of iron ore and 40 kilograms of coke per ton of pig iron produced. This factory saved 3,600 tons of iron ore and 1,500 tons of coke in just one month. The workers in Ozd saved a total of 5,000 tons of iron ore and 2,500 tons of coke in one month. The raw materials saved by the workers of the Szeged Textile Factory in one month are enough to make 5,000 men's shirts.
    Workers across the country are paying special attention to saving imported raw materials. The Budapest Sulfuric Acid Plant used imported catalyst in the past, costing $4,000 per ton. Currently, the plant's workers have worked hard and are able to make their own catalyst, saving the country a lot of foreign exchange. The Piek Machine Tool Factory in Győr has also developed a new type of steel to replace expensive imported goods. The Csepel Petroleum Factory has saved a total of 24 tons of imported petroleum since the beginning of this year.
    In terms of reducing production costs, the Budapest Metal Equipment and Machine Tool Factory originally planned to reduce costs by 12.3%, but so far it has been reduced to 15.7%; the Red Star Tractor Factory originally planned to reduce costs by 6.5%, but now it has been reduced to 11.5%.
    Currently, workers across the country are further developing the invention and innovation movement, improving production technology, and promoting advanced labor methods in order to better complete the tasks they have proposed as gifts to the Party Congress.
    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest Dispatch: The large number of agricultural production cooperatives established in Hungary during the upsurge of socialist transformation of agriculture this spring have achieved remarkable results in production and the public construction of cooperatives.
    Due to the high enthusiasm of the peasants for production, the results of this year's spring plowing and sowing work are much better than in previous years. Due to the implementation of collective and planned management, land has been used more rationally, and the sown area of many important crops has been expanded compared to previous years. For example, the sown area of ​​corn accounted for only 12.6% of the total cultivated area last year, but this year it has increased to 16.2%. By the end of this year, collective livestock will also increase from 11.8 head per hundred holds of land at the beginning of the year to 13.3 head.
    This year's early spring vegetables are 10% to 15% cheaper than last year. The supply of meat and milk has also improved greatly. In the first four months of this year, the state purchased two thousand more train cars of cattle, one hundred and forty million liters of milk, thirteen thousand quintals of poultry, and twenty-three million eggs than a year ago.
    The organized farmers actively launched public construction work with collective strength, and canals were dug, wells were dug, and roads were built everywhere.
    The centralized livestock requires a large number of public livestock sheds, which is one of the urgent problems to be solved since the rapid development of the cooperative movement this spring. This year, in addition to the state construction enterprises building modern cattle sheds for agricultural production cooperatives that can accommodate 28,000 head of cattle and 11,000 calves, the local construction enterprises and the construction teams of the agricultural production cooperatives will also build buildings worth 280 million forints, mainly livestock sheds. Now all the livestock of the cooperatives in Győr-Sopron County are kept in public livestock sheds.
    The newly established cooperatives need a large number of agricultural machines. Currently, factories across the country are vigorously launching a movement to support agricultural production cooperatives. The workers are tapping their potential and guaranteeing to provide farmers with more agricultural machines. In addition, the Soviet Union will provide Hungary with more than 12,000 agricultural machines this year.
    The organizational leadership of agricultural cooperatives is also strengthening day by day. The newly elected leaders of the cooperatives, relying on the support of the vast number of members, are constantly improving their work. Currently, more than 800 agricultural technical experts are working in the newly established production cooperatives.
    In the upsurge of socialist transformation in rural areas, the political enthusiasm of the peasants is high, and many outstanding peasants have been accepted into the Party. The political leadership core of the new rural areas is constantly being strengthened.

    改进生产技术　推广先进经验　降低生产成本
    匈牙利职工用新的成就迎接党代会
    广大农民热情高涨　新建农业社日益巩固
    本报布达佩斯5日电　匈牙利各工厂企业的职工正展开劳动竞赛，以新的成就来迎接将在今年11月底召开的社会主义工人党第七次代表大会。
    勒林茨钢铁厂职工们已经超额生产了五千吨钢板，现在又提出再增产三千吨钢板的保证。哈扎纺织厂原规定全年要增产价值一千二百万福林的产品，由于职工们想办法改进了技术和操作方法，到目前为止，已增产了价值五百五十万福林的产品。
    切佩尔石油工厂由于充分采用了职工们的合理化建议，已超额加工制造了一千吨原油。
    最近布达佩斯有五十个较大的工厂总结了两个多月来劳动竞赛的初步成绩。据统计，一般地都超额完成了献礼任务。4月份提高劳动生产率的计划超额完成了2％。布达佩斯金属器材和机床厂平均每一工人的生产额比计划高了13％。布达佩斯盖巴尼纺织厂平均每一工人的生产额比原计划提高了11.2％。出口产品的生产一般都超额完成了4％—5％。
    与劳动竞赛的同时，匈牙利全国职工还注意节省原料、降低生产成本，并已取得巨大的成绩。
    斯大林城的多瑙河钢铁厂目前每生产一吨钢比原订计划少用一百多公斤焦炭。迪奥日吉厄尔冶金联合厂每生产一吨生铁可节约一百公斤铁矿和四十公斤焦炭。这个工厂仅在一个月内就节约了三千六百吨铁矿和一千五百吨焦炭。俄斯特的职工们在一个月内共节约了五千吨铁矿和二千五百吨焦炭。塞格特纺织厂的职工们在一个月内节约的原料足够做五千件男人衬衣。
    全国职工特别注意节约进口原料。布达佩斯硫酸厂过去使用进口触媒剂，每吨价值四千美元。目前该厂职工经过努力，已能自制触媒剂，为国家节约了大量外汇。吉厄尔市的皮克机床厂也制成了一种新的钢材来代替贵重的进口货。切佩尔石油工厂从今年年初到现在总共节约了二十四吨进口石油。
    在降低生产成本方面，布达佩斯金属器材和机床厂原来计划要降低12.3％，但到现在为止已降低到15.7％；红星拖拉机厂原来计划降低6.5％，现在已降低到11.5％。
    目前全国各地职工都在进一步开展创造发明运动，改进生产技术，推广先进的劳动方法，以便更好地完成他们提出的向党代表大会献礼的任务。
    新华社布达佩斯讯　匈牙利在今年春天的农业社会主义改造高潮中所成立的大批农业生产合作社在生产和合作社的公共建设方面已经取得了显著的成绩。
    由于农民生产热情的高涨，今年春耕春播工作的成绩比往年好得多。由于实行了集体的有计划经营，使土地得到了更合理的使用，很多重要的农作物的播种面积比往年扩大了。例如玉米的播种面积去年只占全部耕种面积的12.6％，今年已增加到16.2％。到今年年底，集体牲畜也将从年初每一百霍尔特土地上有十一点八头增加到十三点三头。
    今年的早春蔬菜比去年便宜了10％到15％。肉和牛奶等的供应也有了很大的改善，在今年的头四个月内，国家比一年前多收购了两千车厢的牛、一亿四千万公升的牛奶、一万三千公担的家禽和两千三百万个鸡蛋。
    组织起来的农民用集体的力量积极展开了公共建设工作，各地纷纷开渠、挖井和修路。
    集中起来的牲畜需要大批的公共畜舍，这是今春迅速展开合作化运动以来急待解决的问题之一。今年除了国家建筑企业将为农业生产合作社建筑能容纳两万八千头牛和一万一千头牛犊的现代化牛舍外，地方建筑企业和农业生产合作社的建筑队还将建成价值两亿八千万福林的建筑物，其中主要是畜舍。现在吉厄尔—索普伦州的合作社的全部牲口已经都养在公共的畜舍里。
    新成立的合作社需要大量的农业机器。目前全国各地的工厂都在大力展开支援农业生产合作社的运动。工人们纷纷发挥潜力，保证给农民提供更多的农业机器。此外，苏联今年还将向匈牙利提供一万二千多台农业机器。
    农业合作社的组织领导也在一天天地加强。新选出的合作社的领导依靠广大社员的支持，在不断地改进工作。目前已有八百多农业技术专家在新成立的生产合作社工作。
    在农村社会主义改造的热潮中农民的政治热情高涨，很多优秀的农民已被接受入党。新农村的政治领导核心正在不断地加强中。
