Ten Great Benefits of Diverting the Tao River Uphill

    One: Develop agricultural production: Transform 15 million to 20 million mu of dry land in the central and eastern mountainous areas of Gansu into paddy fields, increasing annual grain production by 3.9 billion jin, ginned cotton by 50 million jin, and rapeseed by 290 million jin.
    Two: Accelerate afforestation: Plant 25 million mu of trees, producing 3.3 billion cubic meters of timber annually once the forests mature.
    Three: Promote soil and water conservation: Transform 75 million mu of mountainous and sloping land into terraced fields, and turn gullies into flat platforms.
    Four: Develop hydropower resources: Build over a hundred hydropower stations with a total annual power generation of 2.1 billion kilowatt-hours, enough to power 3,000 factories with a capacity of 1,000 kilowatts each, and provide lighting for 3 million households.
    Five: Prosper the diversified economy in mountainous areas: Plant economic crops such as fruit trees, mulberry trees, medicinal herbs, and vegetables on a large scale.
    Six: Support industrial construction: Ensure a sufficient supply of grain, raw materials, and electricity for factories.
    Seven: Develop animal husbandry: Expand grasslands by 15 million mu, grazing over 2 million head of livestock. Assuming 250,000 head of cattle are grazed, 1 billion jin of milk can be produced; assuming 1.8 million sheep are grazed, annual wool production can reach 5.4 million jin.
    Eight: Develop aquaculture: Raise 3 million ducks, producing 6 million jin of fish annually.
    Nine: Provide full navigation and facilitate transportation: This "mountain canal" can accommodate ships of 20 to 100 tons throughout its length, and combined with the roads and cart tracks along the route, the annual transport volume can reach 8.57 million ton-kilometers.
    Ten: Develop mountain culture and improve living conditions.

    引洮上山的十大好处
    一：发展农业生产：使甘肃中、东部山区的一千五百到二千万亩旱地变水田，每年增产粮食三十九亿斤，皮棉五千万斤，油菜籽二亿九千万斤。
    二，加速绿化：可植树造林二千五百万亩，成林后年产木材三十三亿立方公尺。
    三，促进水土保持：可使七千五百万亩山地、坡地梯田化、沟地川台化。
    四，开发水力资源：建立水力发电站百余座，年发电总量二十一亿度，可供容电量一千瓩的三千个工厂的动力用电，供三百万户居民照明用电。
    五，繁荣山区多种经济：可大批栽种果树、桑树、药材、蔬菜等经济作物。
    六，支援工业建设：工厂的粮食、原料和电力能得到充分的供应。
    七，发展牧业：扩大草原一千五百万亩，放牧牲畜二百余万头，以放牧牛二十五万头计，可产牛奶十亿斤；以放牧羊一百八十万只计，年产羊毛可达五百四十万斤。
    八，发展水产事业：可养鸭三百万只，年产鱼六百万斤。
    九，全线通航、便利交通：这条“山上运河”全线可行驶二十吨到一百吨的船只，加上沿线的公路和大车路，年运量可达八百五十七万吨公里。
    十，发展山区文化、改善居住条件。
