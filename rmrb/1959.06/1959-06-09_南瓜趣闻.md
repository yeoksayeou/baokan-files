Pumpkin Anecdotes

    Soviet scholars have cleverly paired pumpkins, using grafting methods to make watermelons and cantaloupes grow on pumpkins.

    Old Chinese farmers have discovered that the direction pointed to by the first true leaf (new green leaf) of a pumpkin is the direction in which the vine will extend. Based on this, planning arrangements during seedling setting can avoid the need for subsequent vine trimming.

    African travelers often use hollowed-out pumpkins strung together as rafts to cross rivers, and then use them to hold water after crossing.

    Australians like to saw open old pumpkins, hollow them out, and wear them as hats.

    Many South American pumpkin varieties are shaped like bottles or cans. Locals hollow them out and use them to store grain or milk. (Hong Yun)
