Czechoslovakia's Plan for Developing Agriculture

    In the past decade, Czechoslovakia's industry has developed rapidly, with an average annual growth of 11.7%. In 1958, industrial production had already increased by 2.3 times compared to the pre-war peak level of 1937. With the high development of industry, the development of agriculture in Czechoslovakia has not been able to meet the needs of industrial development, thus affecting the further upsurge of the national economy. In order to eliminate the gap between industry and agriculture, the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party put forward the goals and tasks of developing agriculture, namely, by 1965, agricultural production should increase by 40% compared with 1957, and the socialist transformation of the rural areas should be basically completed by next year (1960) at the latest.

    In order to reverse the current situation where grain products cannot be self-sufficient and animal husbandry relies on imported feed, the CCP has decided to first pay attention to increasing the yield per unit area and the amount of animal husbandry products per hectare of land. The CCP Central Committee requires that by 1965, the national average wheat yield reach 2.7 tons per hectare, rye 2.5 tons, and barley 2.65 tons. Huge tasks have also been put forward in terms of non-staple foods. By 1965, each person in Czechoslovakia will receive 61 kilograms of meat, 235 kilograms of milk and dairy products, 210 eggs, and 123 kilograms of flour per year.

    In order to accomplish this huge task, the CCP Central Committee has taken a series of measures, deciding to provide agriculture with 100,000 new tractors by 1965 and to use a large number of machines for the mechanization of animal husbandry production. It also requires that the output of chemical fertilizers be increased to two and a half times that of 1957. At the same time, it also requires attention to strengthening the development of agricultural cooperatives and fundamentally improving the work of state farms.

    At present, Czechoslovakia has approximately 12,300 unified agricultural cooperatives, with more than 620,000 farmer households. Thus, unified agricultural cooperatives include more than 81.4% of the country's farmer households, cultivating nearly 4.5 million hectares of land. The cooperative cultivated land area accounts for about 75% of the total cultivated land area in the country.

    Czechoslovakia implemented land reform in 1948. From 1948 to 1949, it began to organize unified agricultural cooperatives, but the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement has been in recent years. In March 1957, Czechoslovakia had more than 8,000 unified agricultural cooperatives, with nearly 500,000 members, cultivating 2.2 million hectares of land; by the end of 1958, the number of cooperatives had increased to 12,140, with more than 850,000 members. The development achievements of agricultural cooperatives in 1957 and 1958 are almost equivalent to the sum of the previous years before 1956.

    In the first half of 1959, the agricultural cooperativization movement achieved new successes. At present, more than half of the unified agricultural cooperatives in the country have made guarantees to complete the agricultural production increase tasks stipulated in the second five-year plan (1956-1960) one year ahead of schedule.

    捷克斯洛伐克发展农业的计划
    近十年来，捷克斯洛伐克工业发展速度很快，平均每年增长11.7％。1958年工业生产已比战前最高水平的1937年增加了二点三倍。在工业高度发展的情况下，捷克斯洛伐克农业发展的情况不能适应工业发展的需要，因而影响到国民经济的进一步高涨。为了消除工农业的差异，捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会提出了发展农业的目标和任务，即到1965年的时候，农业生产要比1957年增长40％，至迟到明年（1960年）要基本上完成全国农村的社会主义改造。
    为了扭转当前粮食产品还不能自给和畜牧业依靠输入饲料的情况，捷共决定首先注意提高单位面积产量和每公顷土地上畜牧业产品的数量。捷共中央要求在1965年时全国平均的小麦产量达到每公顷二点七吨，黑麦二点五吨，大麦二点六五吨。在副食品方面也提出了巨大的任务。到1965年时，捷克斯洛伐克每人每年将得到六十一公斤肉、二百三十五公斤牛奶和乳类食品、二百一十个鸡蛋和一百二十三公斤面粉等。
    为了要完成这个巨大的任务，捷共中央采取了一系列的措施，决定在1965年向农业提供十万台新的拖拉机和大量使用畜牧业生产机械化的机器，并且要求使化学肥料的产量增加为1957年的两倍半，同时还要求注意加强发展农业合作社和从根本上改进国营农场的工作。
    现在，捷克斯洛伐克共有约一万二千三百个统一农业合作社，这些合作社拥有六十二万多个农户。这样，统一农业合作社就包括了全国农户中的81.4％以上的农户，耕种的土地将近四百五十万公顷，合作社耕地面积占全国耕地总面积的75％左右。
    捷克斯洛伐克1948年实行了土地改革，1948—1949年，开始组织统一农业合作社，但是农业合作化运动发展的高潮还在最近几年。在1957年3月，捷克斯洛伐克共有八千多个统一农业合作社，近五十万名社员，耕地面积达二百二十万公顷；而到1958年底，合作社数目已增加到一万二千一百四十个，社员有八十五万多名。在1957年和1958年两年内，农业社的发展成就几乎相当于1956年以前几年的总和。
    1959年上半年，农业合作化运动又取得了新的成就，目前全国已经有半数以上的统一农业合作社作出了保证，要提前一年完成第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）所规定的农业增产的任务。　（德）
