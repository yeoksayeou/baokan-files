Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 1st: A mass rally held in Calcutta on the evening of May 31st passed a resolution stating that the people of West Bengal are determined to repel all attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs and damage Sino-Indian friendship.

The resolution called on the people to defeat the "sinister conspiracy of Indian reactionary forces attempting to undermine Sino-Indian friendship, thereby serving the interests of imperialism."

The conference, presided over by renowned journalist Dhirendra Nath Sen, was convened by the United Socialist Organisation in cooperation with the Communist Party of India.

The entire venue was packed. Banners hung on the walls reading, "No Interference in Tibet!" "Tibet is China's Internal Affair."

The conference decided to establish a committee to launch a campaign to counter the "vicious propaganda launched by a minority of political parties and reactionaries in India. This vicious propaganda openly attempts to undermine Sino-Indian friendship. In the long run, this will hinder the Asian anti-imperialist and peace movement."

The committee will be chaired by Dhirendra Nath Sen and the secretary will be Subodh Banerjee, leader of the United Socialist Organisation. It will include representatives from the Communist Party of India and other left-wing parties, as well as historians, doctors, and writers.

A major resolution of the conference condemned the "minority political parties and reactionaries" in India for launching hostile propaganda "against socialism, especially against the People's Republic of China," regarding the recent events in Tibet. The conference believes that Tibet is an indivisible part of China. "The Tibetan people are an integral part of the Chinese nation." The conference believes that "the Tibetan rebellion was launched under the leadership of serf owners and reactionary lamas, instigated by imperialists. This rebellion was against the people of Tibet."

The conference also condemned the absurd claims of establishing a so-called "independent Tibet," a "buffer Tibet."

The conference expressed satisfaction that the Tibetan rebellion was brought under control in the shortest possible time. The conference also expressed strong support for the Chinese people's advance against the reactionaries and in building socialism to liberate the Tibetan people.

Representatives of the United Socialist Organisation, the Communist Party of India, and the Bolshevik Party of India, among others, spoke at the conference. They unanimously expressed support for the resolutions.

Sibdas Ghosh, leader of the United Socialist Organisation, pointed out in his speech that Tibet is part of China. China has the right to take any measures it deems appropriate to suppress lawbreakers there. He warned that the Indian people will never tolerate attempts to create division between the Indian and Chinese people. He ridiculed the idea of making Tibet a "buffer state" between India and China. An "independent" Tibet would only help the attempts of British and American imperialism to establish military bases on the roof of the world.

Mukherjee, leader of the Communist Party of West Bengal, said that the Indian people will never tolerate any distortion of the facts and historical truths about Tibet.

Nath Sen firmly advocated strengthening Sino-Indian friendship, and that India should not do anything to harm the friendship between these two great countries.

Many prominent figures and groups from West Bengal and other states sent telegrams condemning the activities of a minority of reactionaries in India in inciting opposition to China over the Tibetan issue, and emphasized the need to defend Sino-Indian friendship.

    加尔各答群众大会向全印人民号召
    击败反华阴谋　保卫印中友谊
    决定成立专门委员会反击反动派的恶毒宣传
    新华社新德里1日电　加尔各答5月31日晚上举行的群众大会通过决议表示，西孟加拉邦人民决心击退一切干涉中国内政和损害印中友好的企图。
    决议要求人民击败印度“反动力量企图破坏印中友好从而为帝国主义的利益服务的险恶的阴谋”。
    这个由著名新闻工作者迪伦德拉·纳特·森主持的大会是在印度共产党合作下由统一社会主义组织召开的。
    整个会场都挤满了人。墙上挂着“不许干涉西藏！”“西藏是中国的内政”等标语。
    大会决定成立一个委员会，以便展开运动来反击印度“少数政党和反动分子所发动的恶毒宣传。这种恶毒宣传公然企图破坏印中友谊。从长远来说，这将妨碍亚洲的反帝与和平运动。”
    这个委员会由迪伦德拉·纳特·森担任主席，由统一社会主义组织领袖苏波德·班纳吉担任书记。它将包括印度共产党和其他一些左翼政党的代表以及历史学家、医生和文学家。
    大会的一项主要决议谴责印度“少数政党和反动分子”“就最近发生的西藏事件对社会主义、特别是对中华人民共和国”发动的敌意宣传。大会认为，西藏是中国不可分割的一部分。“藏族是中华民族的组成部分”。大会认为，“西藏叛乱是在帝国主义者鼓动下在农奴主和反动喇嘛的领导下发动的。这次叛乱是反对西藏人民的”。
    大会也谴责了关于建立所谓“独立的西藏”、“缓冲的西藏”这样的荒谬主张。
    大会对西藏的叛乱在最短的时间内就被控制住这一点表示满意。大会还表示大力声援中国人民反对反动派和建设社会主义解放西藏人民的进军。
    统一社会主义组织、印度共产党和印度布尔什维克党等的代表在大会上讲了话。他们一致表示支持各项决议。
    统一社会主义组织领袖西布德斯·高希在发言中指出，西藏是中国的一部分。中国有权采取它认为适当的任何措施以镇压那里的不法分子。他警告说，印度人民决不会容忍在印度人民和中国人民之间制造分裂的企图。他嘲笑了那种想使西藏成为印度和中国之间的“缓冲国”的主张。“独立的”西藏只能帮助英美帝国主义要想在世界屋脊上建立军事基地的企图。
    西孟加拉邦共产党领袖慕克吉说，印度人民决不会容忍对有关西藏的情况和历史事实的任何歪曲。
    纳特·森坚决主张加强中印友好关系，印度不应该作出任何损害这两个伟大国家之间的友谊的事。
    西孟加拉和其他各邦的许多著名人士和团体发来电报，谴责印度国内少数反动分子在西藏问题上煽动反对中国的活动，并且强调必须保卫印中友谊。
