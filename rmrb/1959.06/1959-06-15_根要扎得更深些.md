    Roots Must Be Planted Deeper
    To achieve a bumper harvest of crops, deep plowing and careful cultivation are necessary, allowing the roots of seedlings to be planted deeper and absorb more nutrients. To achieve a bumper harvest in students' learning, they must also learn sufficient basic knowledge and absorb more nutrients. If roots are deep and foliage luxuriant, then fruits will be plentiful and large.
    Higher education is the last link in the process of cultivating young students. In addition to teaching and learning professional courses well, it is also necessary to teach and learn basic courses well. It would be a mistake to think that only professional courses need to be learned well, without delving into basic courses. Because learning only professional knowledge without basic knowledge as a foundation will not lead to good learning. For example, it is unimaginable to design any modern high-power machine without basic knowledge of mathematics, physics, and elasticity mechanics. It is also unimaginable to become a specialized medical talent without basic knowledge of pathology, anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry.
    Deep roots are for lush foliage; broad and profound basic knowledge is for better development of professional knowledge and cultivation of specialized talents. Shanghai First Medical College's emphasis on the teaching of basic courses is very good. Teachers and students in all institutions of higher learning should also conscientiously teach and learn basic courses well, so that the advanced specialized talents needed by the motherland can be well-rooted.

### 根要扎得更深些

    根要扎得更深些
    要想农作物丰收，就要深耕细作，让禾苗的根扎得更深些，更多地吸收养分。要想学生学习丰收，也要让他们学到足够的基础知识，更多地吸收养分。如果能够根深叶茂，那就能够果硕实大。
    高等学校是培养青年学生过程中的最后一个环节。除了要教好和学好专业课程外，还需要教好和学好基础课程。如果说，只要学好专业课程，而不需要深入钻研基础课程，那就会走入歧途。因为只学习专业知识而没有基础知识作为根基是学习不好的。例如，要想设计任何一部现代的高功率机器，而没有数学、物理学、弹性力学等的基础知识，那是不可想像的。要做一个专门医学人才，如果没有病理学、解剖学、生理学、生物化学等的基础知识，也是不可想像的。
    根扎得深，是为了树大叶茂；基础知识学得广博，是为了更好地发展专业知识，培养专门人材。上海第一医学院重视基础课程的教学是很好的。各高等学校的师生也要认真把基础课程教好和学好，让祖国所需要的高级专门人材扎好根子。
