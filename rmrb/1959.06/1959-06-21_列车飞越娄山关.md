    Train Flies Over Lou Mountain Pass
    Yu Guangshao
    The motor train, heading towards the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, was striving to advance towards Lou Mountain Pass along the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway. The driver, Chen Wantang, looked at the towering pass ahead through the car window, feeling both nervous and excited: Lou Mountain Pass, oh Lou Mountain Pass, we're going to make you bow your head today!
    Making Lou Mountain Pass bow its head is no easy task. In the past, no one like him had ever towed a large trailer with a main vehicle, fully loaded with nine tons of cargo, over the pass. Especially these days in early spring, the Lou Mountain Pass, at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters, is filled with rain and snow; the steep and winding road is covered with ice. It's difficult enough for a single vehicle to travel, let alone a train? Chen Wantang thought of these things and couldn't help but feel a bit tricky; but he still gripped the steering wheel tightly and drove forward.
    Since the Party called for the development of transportation capacity, motor trains have been running on the plains; but long-distance buses in mountainous areas are still "going solo." Some bring a small trailer, but it's never been fully loaded; and in these days of ice and snow, even the small trailers are left behind.
    Chen Wantang is a driver for the Chongqing Transportation Company. This time, the company sent him to run the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, transporting salt to the people of Guizhou and manganese ore back to the steel mills of Chongqing. The heavy and urgent task made him deeply aware that single-vehicle transportation was far from meeting the needs of the motherland. Lou Mountain Pass is a difficult obstacle to running trains on the Sichuan-Guizhou road. Conquering it and using facts to break the notion that trains cannot run over Lou Mountain Pass will end the "solo" careers of the hundreds of cars running on this road, as well as the tens of thousands of cars on other mountain roads. The leadership enthusiastically supported him and pointed out the issues that should be paid attention to. But when he looked for comrades in the group to discuss, some people said coldly: "Trains running on Lou Mountain Pass? Humph, strange!"
      "No, it's not strange, it's a miracle!" Chen Wantang argued seriously and patiently. He also discussed with everyone and clarified: When running trailers on flat roads, the engine still has spare power. If we make full use of this power, and I am a bit more clever and skillful, wouldn't Lou Mountain Pass possibly open the pass and surrender? With the help of maintenance workers, he was also the first to install a power-adding box on the main vehicle to enhance its climbing power. Thus, the five-section train, fully loaded with goods, sped towards the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The wheels rolled over the steep and dangerous Diaosi Rock, climbed up the winding Seventy-Two Bends, and came to the foot of Lou Mountain Pass in one go.
    The towering Lou Mountain Pass seemed to be deliberately antagonizing the drivers. The road was slippery, and people had to use crutches and wear straw sandals to walk; the mountain was shrouded in thick fog, and one could hardly see a few feet away. The train advanced with difficulty. But what was difficulty to them? Chen Wantang and his partners put anti-skid chains on the wheels, and on steep slopes where the chains could not prevent slippage, they chiseled ice channels on the ice and laid sand and stones to prevent the wheels from sliding backward. When thick fog came, they turned on the anti-fog lights to guide the road, sometimes even sticking their heads out of the car, exploring forward inch by inch.
    One bend, then another, the summit of Lou Mountain Pass was close in front of them. Chen Wantang's young heart soared with the joy of victory: Once trailer trains start running in mountainous areas, we can transport millions of tons more goods for the motherland. But at this moment, partner Chen Qisen's train had a problem: The road was too slippery, and the trailer was pulling the main vehicle backward. He increased the throttle and ran at full power, but the car still kept retreating. Chen Wantang, who was running in front, cleverly started the "power-adding box," and using the method of "releasing a long line to catch a big fish," he tied a steel rope to the rear of his train and forcefully pulled Chen Qisen's train out of the trap. Finally, the five-section train rumbled up Lou Mountain Pass. From then on, Lou Mountain Pass opened its gates day and night, obediently welcoming the motor trains coming and going from north to south.

    列车飞越娄山关
    喻光韶
    奔向云贵高原的汽车列车，沿着川黔公路，使劲地往娄山关挺进着。驾驶员陈万堂透过车窗，望望眼前的巍巍关隘，心里又紧张、又激动：娄山关呀娄山关，我们今天要你低头啦！
    要娄山关低头，不是件容易事。过去，还没有人像他这样，用主车拖住一辆大挂车，满载九吨货物，奔过关去。特别是初春的这些天，海拔两千多公尺的娄山关上，雨雪纷飞；坡陡弯急的公路，冰凌遍地。单车行驶已很困难，何况列车？陈万堂想起这些，不免感到几分棘手；可是他仍紧握方向盘，驱车挺进。
    自从党号召发展运输力以来，平原上的汽车列车跑起来了；但是山区的长途汽车，却还是“单干”。有的带个小拖斗，也没装满过；而在这冰封雪冻的日子里，就连小拖斗也不带了。
    陈万堂是重庆运输公司的驾驶员。公司这次派他跑川黔公路，给贵州人民运去盐巴，给重庆的钢厂运回锰矿。又重又急的任务，使他深感单车运输，远不能适应祖国的需要。娄山关是阻碍川黔路开行列车的难关，攻下它，用事实打破不能开列车过娄山关的说法，奔驰在这条路上的几百辆汽车，以及其他山区公路上的成千上万辆汽车，才会结束“单干”生涯。领导上热情地赞助了他，向他指点了应注意的问题。但当他找组内同志研究时，却也有人风言冷语：“娄山关跑列车？哼，奇怪！”
      “不，不是奇怪，那是奇迹！”陈万堂严肃耐心地进行辩解。又同大家讨论明白：平路跑挂车，引擎还有余力，把这部分力量充分使用起来，自己再心灵手巧一点，娄山关不就可能开关投降？在保修工人的帮助下，他又第一个在主车上安上了加力箱，增强了爬坡力量。于是，五节列车，便满装货物，向云贵高原飞奔而来。车轮滚过陡峭险峻的吊丝岩，爬上盘旋曲折的七十二拐，一股劲来到娄山关下。
    耸入云天的娄山关，仿佛有意跟驾驶员们作对。路，滑溜溜的，人行也要拄拐棍、套草鞋；山，浓雾茫茫，一眼望不到几尺远。列车艰难地前进着。可是艰难对于他们，那在话下？陈万堂同伙伴们，把防滑链条套上车轮，在链条也不能止滑的陡坡上，他们就在冰上凿起冰道子，铺上沙石，不准车轮向后滑。浓雾袭来，他们就打开避雾灯指引车道，有时甚至把头伸出车外，一分一寸地探索前进。
    过一弯，又一拐，娄山关顶峰近在车前。陈万堂年青的心，腾起了胜利的喜悦：山区拖挂一跑开，我们就能为祖国多运千万吨货物。但在这时，伙伴陈启森的列车出问题了：路太滑，挂车拉着主车往后退。他加大油门，开足马力，车子仍然退个不停。跑在前面的陈万堂，灵巧地开动“加力箱”，用“放长线，吊大鱼”的方法，在自己列车的尾部系上钢绳，用力把陈启森的列车拉出了陷槽。终于五节列车轰轰隆隆开上娄山关。从此，娄山关日夜敞开关口，恭顺地迎送着南来北往的汽车列车了。
