    Expanding Sources of Non-Staple Foods
    Gao Changren

    The practice of Zhuzhou City, which combines urban and rural areas and adopts a two-pronged approach to develop non-staple food production, provides a set of specific experiences for solving the problem of non-staple food supply in medium-sized cities and emerging industrial cities. In addition to establishing non-staple food supply bases in the suburbs, Zhuzhou City has also tapped into a portion of its production potential in the urban area to organize the production of non-staple foods, which can be said to be "double insurance."

    Producing a portion of non-staple foods in medium-sized cities is undoubtedly feasible. Because these cities generally have favorable conditions. The first is that the population is not very dense, and there are many open spaces in front of and behind the houses of each factory, institution, and school. In particular, newly emerging industrial and mining areas and industrial cities have some land that is prepared for capital construction but is currently idle. Using these large and small open spaces to grow melons and vegetables will yield considerable gains. Secondly, manpower is not a problem. Because engaging in amateur labor is the glorious tradition of our revolutionary ranks. Currently, the atmosphere of labor being glorious has taken root in the hearts of the people. Calling on workers, cadres, teachers, and students to use some of their spare time to engage in simple labor such as growing vegetables will be something that everyone is willing to do and is also within their capabilities. Compared with the urban population, there is still less land and more people. If everyone participates in growing melons and vegetables, it will certainly not become a burden and will not affect production and work.

    As for raising pigs in the city, it depends on the specific situation. It is also permissible for catering units with more dispersed residences, better sanitary facilities, and more adequate feed to raise some pigs for their own consumption. In particular, some emerging industrial and mining areas similar to Zhuzhou have the above-mentioned favorable conditions, and it is worth greatly promoting the mobilization of collective catering units to raise pigs.

    Judging from the current ratio of non-staple foods produced in the suburbs and urban areas of Zhuzhou City, the proportion of urban areas is not large. However, we should not underestimate it. At a time when non-staple food production cannot keep up with people's growing consumption needs, fully utilizing such a portion of the city's production potential is beneficial and harmless, both in terms of increasing wealth for the country and meeting our own needs.

    扩大副食品来源
    高长任
    株洲市采取城乡结合、双管齐下发展副食品生产的做法，为中等城市和新兴的工业城市解决副食品供应问题，提供了一套具体的经验。株洲市除了在郊区建立副食品供应基地，又从市区挖掘了一部分生产潜力，来组织副食品的生产，可以说是“双保险”。
    在中等城市里生产一部分副食品，无疑是可行的。因为这些城市一般地都具备着有利条件。首先是人口不大稠密，每个工厂、机关、学校的屋前屋后，都有不少空地。特别是新兴的工矿区和工业城市，都有一些准备进行基本建设而目前还在闲置的地皮，把这些大大小小的空地利用起来，种瓜种菜，就会有不小的收获。其次，人力也不成问题。因为从事业余劳动是我们革命队伍的光荣传统。目前劳动光荣的风气，已经深入人心，号召工人、干部、学校师生，利用一些业余时间，从事培育蔬菜等简易劳动，会是人人愿意，也是力所能及的。城市的空地和人口比较起来，还是地少人多，如果大家都动手来种瓜种菜，绝不致变成负担，不致影响生产和工作。
    至于城市养猪，也要看具体情况。在居住比较分散、卫生设备较好、又有较充分的饲料的伙食单位，喂养一些自己食用的生猪，也是未尝不可的。特别是与株洲相似的那样一些新兴的工矿区，具有上述那些有利条件，发动集体伙食单位养猪是值得大大提倡的。
    从株洲市郊区和市区目前生产的副食品比例来看，市区所占的比例也不大。但是，我们不应该小看它。在目前副食品生产还赶不上人们日益增长的消费需要的时候，充分利用城市这么一分生产潜力，这从为国家增加财富和满足自己的需要来说，都是有利无害的。
