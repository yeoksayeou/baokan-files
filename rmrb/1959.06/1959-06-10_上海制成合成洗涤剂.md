    Synthetic Detergent Made in Shanghai
    A synthetic detergent that can replace soap has been successfully trial-produced in Shanghai and is starting small-scale experimental production.
    Manufacturing synthetic detergents requires a lot of chemical equipment resistant to strong corrosion, and the temperature must also be strictly controlled. The Shanghai Yongxing Factory, Shanghai Soap Factory, and other four soap factories participating in this trial production succeeded with the assistance of the Food Research Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry.

    上海制成合成洗涤剂
    一种可以代替肥皂的合成洗涤剂在上海试制成功，并且开始小批的试验性生产。
    制造合成洗涤剂需要许多耐强烈腐蚀的化学设备，温度也要有严格的控制。参加这次试制的上海永星厂、上海制皂厂等四个肥皂厂是在轻工业部食品研究所的协助下获得成功的。
