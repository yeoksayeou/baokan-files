Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 27th. There are two factories in Nanchang City: one is the Nanchang Power Accessories Factory, which has poor equipment conditions and weak technical strength. However, the leadership work is meticulous, the drive is strong, and there are many methods. They actively deal with difficulties and strive to improve the quality of castings. Since the beginning of this year, the monthly finished product rate has remained stable at around 96%. The other is the Nanchang Sand Casting Factory, which has better equipment conditions and stronger technical strength. However, the leadership emphasizes difficulties and relaxes subjective efforts, resulting in an average monthly finished product rate of only 77.58%.

　　The Nanchang Power Accessories Factory has only more than 300 people. The sand casting workshop has neither crane equipment nor laboratory instruments. Among the 107 workers in the entire workshop, there are only six technicians. The products are complex and diverse, and the quality of some raw materials is not good enough. Therefore, the product scrap rate once reached about 40%. In order to improve the quality of castings, factory leaders worked with veteran workers to analyze the reasons and study solutions. They educated workers to establish a quality concept, establish a strict inspection system, and conduct careful inspection and review of drawings. The quality of the molding sand and mud was not good, so the leadership helped the workers establish a system of regular sand screening twice a month to remove weeds and iron filings from the sand and mud. Before each casting is put into production, a sample is made for testing, and opinions are widely solicited from workers, and operating requirements are explained. After being put into production, the quality is checked several times. Raw materials are also strictly inspected and used according to the different requirements of the products, and the iron melting furnace is improved to increase the air temperature. In this way, the situation of low casting quality was quickly changed.

　　The Nanchang Sand Casting Factory specializes in sand casting. It has crane equipment, and there are 21 technical workers in the sand casting workshop, including eighth-grade master craftsmen. It also has complex products, poor raw material quality, and a high scrap rate. The factory leaders also checked the reasons, but overemphasized objective difficulties and relaxed subjective efforts. After each quality inspection, no timely measures were taken to solve the problem, or some methods were devised, but they were not resolutely implemented. For example, the quality of sand and mud was not good, and the leadership emphasized that "the task was tight," and did not arrange time to find a way to clean it up in time, resulting in a lot of impurities. Sometimes, when manufacturing a new batch of products, the leadership saw that the number of products was small, and put them into production without prior testing. Only after defective products were produced did they come to study and analyze. In addition, very few strict quality requirements were made to workers. Therefore, the scrap rate of castings in this factory has always been unable to be reduced.

　　Recently, the Nanchang Sand Casting Factory, through a mass quality inspection, further analyzed the reasons for the low product quality and summarized the lessons learned. The leadership has made up its mind to rely on the masses and resolutely reverse the situation of low product quality.

    作法不同　效果各异
    南昌动力配件厂积极想办法克服困难产品质量高
    南昌翻砂厂强调客观困难放松了努力产品质量低
    新华社南昌27日电　南昌市有这样两个工厂，一个是南昌动力配件厂，设备条件较差，技术力量较薄弱，但是领导工作做得细致，干劲大，办法多，积极对待困难，努力提高铸件质量，今年以来，每月成品率一直稳定在96％左右。另一个是南昌市翻砂厂，设备条件较好，技术力量较强，但是领导上较多地强调困难，放松了主观努力，结果每月成品率平均只达到77.58％。
    南昌动力配件厂只有三百多人，翻砂车间既没有行车设备，也没有化验仪器，全车间一百零七个工人中只有六名技工，产品又复杂、多样，有些原料的质量还不够好，因此产品报废率曾经高达40％左右。为了提高铸件质量，工厂领导干部找老工人共同分析原因，研究办法。他们教育工人树立质量观念，建立严格的检验制度，对图纸进行细致的检查和复查。造型用的砂泥质量不好，领导上就帮助工人建立每月两次定期筛砂的制度，把砂泥中的杂草、铁屑筛净。每个铸件投入生产以前，先做个样板作试验，广泛征求工人意见，交代操作要求。在投入生产以后，又几次检查质量。对于原料也严格检验，根据产品的不同要求来使用，并且改进熔铁炉，提高风温。这样，很快就改变了铸件质量不高的情况。
    南昌市翻砂厂是搞翻砂专业的，有行车设备，翻砂间有二十一名技术工人，其中有八级的老师傅，同样也是产品复杂，原料质量不够好，废品率高。厂的领导干部也检查了原因，但是过分强调了客观困难，放松了主观努力。每次检查质量以后，没有及时采取措施解决，或者想了一些办法，但没有坚决贯彻执行。例如砂泥质量不好，领导上强调“任务紧张”，没有及时安排时间想办法清理，结果杂质还是很多。有时制造一批新产品，领导上看到产品数量少，事前不作试验就投入生产，待出了废品以后，才来研究分析。此外，对工人也很少提出严格的质量要求。因此，这个厂的铸件报废率总是降不下来。
    最近，南昌市翻砂厂通过群众性的质量大检查，进一步分析了产品质量不高的原因，总结了教训，领导方面已下定决心，依靠群众，坚决扭转产品质量低的局面。
