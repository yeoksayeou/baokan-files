　　Central Red Revolutionary Base Areas, especially the border areas and guerrilla areas, often took advantage of the enemy's lack of attention to children to help the Red Army scout enemy positions. They adopted various ingenious methods, disguising themselves as peddlers and beggars, and infiltrating into the White areas for reconnaissance. When the enemy attacked the base areas, they would pretend to be collecting manure or cutting grass, observing the enemy's strength and direction from afar along the roadside or hidden in the jungle. They became the Red Army's capable eyes and ears.

　　Here I will tell you a heroic story of a children's corps member scouting the enemy. In the western Fujian area of the Central Red Base Area, there was a children's corps member named Guo Dihai. His older brother, Comrade Guo Diren, was the Propaganda Minister of the CPC Western Fujian Special Committee, and his older sister, Comrade Guo Mingying, was a propaganda cadre of the Communist Youth League Western Fujian Special Committee. Later, both gloriously sacrificed in the revolutionary war.

　　Guo Dihai, a native of Longyan, Fujian, was twelve or thirteen years old, short and stout, with a dark, round face. He was usually quiet and did not like to be active. He looked a bit dull, but he was actually very clever, firm and calm, and intelligent and brave, a shrewd and capable young man. His shortcoming was that he did not pay much attention to cleanliness. He was always wearing tattered clothes, patched upon patch. When he felt sleepy, he could sleep anywhere, getting himself covered in dirt and grime, and his hair hung over his forehead like messy thatch, looking like a beggar. Therefore, everyone was used to calling him "Little Beggar." One day in the early winter of 1930, when the enemy attacked Longyan City, our organization hurriedly moved in the middle of the night. For some reason, we couldn't find him when we set off. At dawn, the enemy surrounded the village where he lived, and he was not seen for several days. Everyone was worried about him, especially his older sister and brother. However, one day, he suddenly returned. Everyone was both happy and surprised. It turned out that he had fallen asleep that night in a straw shed where rice straw was piled. When he came out of the room at dawn, he realized that his organization had left and was immediately captured by the White bandits.

　　"Red bandit spy!"

　　"N-n-not spy, I'm c-c-called Little Beggar," Guo Dihai stammered. The White bandit carefully sized up his appearance, suddenly grabbed his neck, and shouted: "Damn it! Still pretending to be stupid!" Another White bandit winked and said:

　　"Drag him out and shoot him, see if he tells the truth!" Guo Dihai honestly told the White bandit that he was indeed called "Little Beggar." The White bandit went to see the straw shed where he slept at night, and seeing that he really looked like a beggar, he let him go. From then on, he used this ruse to beg for food in the White bandit's camp, sleeping on haystacks at night. As the days passed, the White bandits paid less attention to him. One day, he took the opportunity to break out of the village and ran into a scout from the 12th Army of the Red Army near our garrison. He reported the enemy's situation in detail. Later, this part of the enemy was also wiped out by the troops of the Red Army's 12th Army, and the Red Army sent him back to the original organization. The comrades all said, "Little Beggar has courage and resourcefulness." His sister said, "He can really be a little scout!" "No! He's already a little scouting hero!" The comrades praised him in unison. From then on, he disguised himself as a beggar several times to help the Red Army's 12th Army do reconnaissance work.

　　Once, when the enemy attacked the base area, he went to scout a temporary stronghold. He wore a tattered straw hat, carried a broken basket in one hand, with a broken bowl in the basket, and held a dog-beating stick in the other. He walked from the east end of the village to the west end, begging from door to door, while scouting to see how many enemies lived in each house. When he was about to reach the end of the village, and the reconnaissance was almost complete, he secretly rejoiced in his heart, humming a little tune. Suddenly, a bandit officer grabbed his collar from behind and shouted: "Stop!" He was practically lifted up, "Damn it! Red bandit spy, arrest him!" "Go!" Two White bandit soldiers escorted him into a room. "Are you a spy for the Red bandits?" Guo Dihai calmly pretended not to understand and said, "What's a spy?" When he said that he was a begging beggar, the White bandit officer said, "Huh! The other day we saw you begging in that village, and now that we've come to this village, you've followed us here too. What else could you be but a Red bandit spy?!" He realized that the enemy had discovered that he was following them, but he remained calm and told the White bandit that he was indeed a beggar begging for food. "If you don't tell the truth, we'll shoot you!" The White bandit officer pulled out his box cannon, cocked it, and with a "click," loaded a bullet, aiming it at Guo Dihai's head, repeatedly threatening, "Will you talk or not?" The muzzle of the gun tapped on his head. His heart was beating like a drum, thump, thump, thump, thinking that he was finished this time, but he still calmly put on a pitiful look, slowly and pleadingly: "Old Sirs! Since you came, all the villagers have run away, what food can I get! If it weren't for following you, wouldn't I have starved to death these past few days?", and then sighed a long "Sigh!…"

　　The White bandit sneered coldly, threatening, "Don't play tricks! If you don't tell the truth, I'll beat you to death, you mongrel!" Then he really fired a shot with a "Bang," making a hole in the mud next to his foot. Guo Dihai instinctively flinched, but he steeled his heart and firmly said, "Even if you beat me to death, I'm still a beggar!" He pretended to be both resentful and terrified.

　　The White bandits looked him up and down, looking at each other and winking, looking at his dull appearance, the White bandit officer "hmmphed" and said rudely, "Get out of here!" and kicked Guo Dihai's begging basket to the ground, with leftover soup and rice splattering everywhere.

　　"Thank you, Old Sirs, for your kindness!" Guo Dihai quickly picked up his bowl, chopsticks, and basket, and used his hands to pick up the leftover rice that had spilled on the ground and put it back in the bowl.

　　"Get out of here!" The White bandit officer kicked him in the butt again.

　　Guo Dihai took the opportunity to stride out of the gate in a dignified manner, carrying his basket, and went to beg for food from other families.

　　The next day, the third day… Guo Dihai was still begging for food in the village of this White bandit's temporary stronghold, and over time, he became familiar with the White bandits. Later, the White bandit officer forced him to be a spy, spying on the Red Army's intelligence for them. He used the opportunity of scouting the Red Army to report to the local party and guerrilla leaders about the enemy forcing him to be a spy.

　　In the spring of 1931, when Zhong Shaoqiu's battalion of the enemy in Shanghang was attacking the Soviet area, they set up a stronghold in Anxiang, the Red Army base area at the junction of Shanghang and Yongding, building blockhouses and fortifications day and night. Guo Dihai reported this situation to the chairman of the county soviet government. Because the Red Army's main force had transferred to other areas for combat, it was impossible to attack with only the local Red Army independent regiment. The county and independent regiment leaders decided to lure the enemy out and annihilate them in an ambush. The leadership decided to have Guo Dihai use his conditions as a spy for the White bandits to find a way to lure the enemy out.

　　One evening, the county magistrate, the county party secretary, and the commander of the Red Army independent regiment explained to Guo Dihai the task and methods of luring out the enemy, and stipulated the location, time, and signal of the ambush.

　　In the middle of the night, Guo Dihai ran to the White bandit army headquarters in a huff and reported: "The Red bandit district chief led the district company [note] of fifty or sixty people to the village in front in the middle of the night." The White bandit battalion commander asked him how far away it was and how many guns they had. The White bandits discussed it, some said to attack immediately and capture the district chief; others said to wait until dawn. Everyone was talking at once. Guo Dihai listened anxiously, fearing that the enemy would not go, but he still stared at the White bandit battalion commander indifferently. The White bandit battalion commander's adjutant said to Guo Dihai: "Go scout again and see if the Red bandits have left?!"

　　"How dare I go again! They all saw me when they entered the village. I took advantage of them all being scattered and sleeping in various houses to run out and report. If I go again, wouldn't I be throwing my life away?" He replied firmly but pleadingly to the White bandit officer. The White bandit battalion commander hesitated for a while, asking Guo Dihai with suspicion: "Did they really scatter into various houses?"

　　"Who dares to lie!..., I'll go with you to see it!" He replied without hesitation.

　　The White bandit battalion commander gave the adjutant a look, and the adjutant took Guo Dihai out of the room. After a while, the White bandit battalion commander came out of the room and said to Guo Dihai in a friendly manner: "Go! I'll go with you to see if the Red bandits are still there?"

　　Guo Dihai carefully looked at the White bandit soldiers who were gathering, and was secretly happy in his heart. The White bandit army set off, and a White bandit orderly carrying a Mauser followed Guo Dihai and walked in front to lead the way. He also said to Guo Dihai: "Watch your head, don't lead the wrong way!" "If you lead the way well and catch the murderer, I'll reward you with ten silver dollars!" The White bandit battalion commander added.

　　The night covered the earth, the sky twinkled with stars, and along the way, there was not a single light in any village, and the masses had already emptied their houses, and even the sound of dogs barking could not be heard, a scene of silence. While Guo Dihai walked carefully, he thought of the nights in the Red base area. At this time, the children's corps members and Young Pioneers were probably still surrounding the blazing pine oil torches, holding a joint evening party with the Red Army brothers, singing, dancing, and listening to the Red Army telling battle stories, how happy it was! The more he thought about it, the more he hated the White bandits; the more he thought about it, the more he loved the Red Army. He was secretly happy: the time to avenge has come! The spring breeze blew on his face, his heart blossomed, and looking back, the White bandit army was closely following behind. He unconsciously quickened his pace, climbing towards the faintly visible mountain jungle. After climbing halfway up the mountain, the White bandit asked him: "It's almost dawn, how much farther?" "Cross the mountain, and it's just down the mountain." Except for the White bandit officer urging the bandits to hurry, no one dared to speak. As they walked, not far from the top of the mountain, Guo Dihai saw faint figures flashing from the piles of rocks and dense forests, and he rushed into the dense forest and piles of rocks next to the road like a gust of wind, shouting: "Fight! Fight!" The White bandits knew they had been tricked and fired at the dense forest. The Red Army independent regiment troops ambushed in the mountains also opened fire on the enemy. Guo Dihai ran and ran, suddenly feeling a stone hit his arm, staggered a few steps and fell forward.

　　Amidst the fierce gunfire and the explosion of hand grenades, the silent mountain forest suddenly turned into a sea of fire, mixed with the slogans of "Charge!" "Kill!" "Lay down your arms and we won't kill you!" echoing through the valley. The White bandit army was flustered, scattered, and in chaos.

　　In the darkness, the White bandit army was disoriented, panicked, those who were killed were killed, those who were wounded were wounded, some simply lay on the ground and did not get up, waiting to lay down their arms and surrender, and many fell from the cliffs. In less than a few tens of minutes of fighting, all the two hundred or so White bandits were wiped out by us.

　　At dawn, the Red warriors were busy cleaning the battlefield, collecting guns and ammunition, and escorting prisoners, but Guo Dihai was nowhere to be seen, and everyone was very anxious. The county party secretary and the regimental commander sent people to search everywhere. The soldiers searching everywhere shouted "Little Guo!" "Little Guo!", and the shouts shook the valley. Finally, the soldiers found him in a pile of rocks in the dense forest, and everyone rushed over like a tide. The soldiers picked up Guo Dihai, his face covered with scars, and blood flowing from his arms. The county party secretary and the regimental commander also ran over. The secretary hugged him in his arms, the regimental commander and the military doctors were busy rescuing him, and the comrades, seeing him in a daze and unconscious, all cared for him with heavy hearts and affectionately, and tears welled up in their eyes, and the secretary's tears dripped on Little Guo's face. After a while, Little Guo struggled to slowly open his eyes, raised his head to see his own people, and when he heard that the White bandits had all been annihilated, he laughed happily. The soldiers insisted on taking turns carrying Guo Dihai, following the troops who were escorting prisoners and loaded with the spoils of victory, to return in triumph. From then on, the deeds of the little scouting hero spread throughout the children's corps and Young Pioneers in western Fujian.

　　Note: The district company is a guerrilla force led by the district party committee and district government, approximately equivalent to a company; the guerrilla force belonging to the county is called the independent regiment.

    侦察小英雄郭滴海
    张爱萍
    中央红色革命根据地、尤其是边区和游击区的少年儿童，经常利用敌人对小孩不大注意的有利条件，帮助红军侦察敌情，他们采用各式各样的巧妙方法，化装小贩、叫化子，混入白区进行侦察；当敌人进攻根据地时，就装成拾粪的、割草的，在远远的路旁，或暗藏在丛林里，观察敌人的兵力和去向。他们成为红军得力的耳目。
    在这里我告诉你们一个儿童团员侦察敌人的英雄故事。中央红色根据地的闽西地区有个名叫郭滴海的儿童团员，他的哥哥郭滴人同志是中共闽西特委宣传部长；姐姐郭明英同志是共青团闽西特委宣传干事，后来，都在革命战争中光荣牺牲了。
    郭滴海，福建龙岩人，十二三岁，矮矮胖胖的结实身材，黑黝黝的圆脸蛋，平时不声不响，不爱活动，看上去，好像有点呆头呆脑的样子，其实心眼可多呢，既坚定沉着，又聪明伶俐，是个机智勇敢的精明能干的小伙子。缺点就是不大讲清洁卫生，他老是穿着一身破衣服，补丁一层又一层，瞌睡来了，什么地方都能睡觉，弄得满身污黑，肮肮脏脏，头发像乱茅草似的披在前额，简直像叫化子一样，所以，大家都惯叫他“小叫化子”。1930年初冬的一天，龙岩城敌人进攻时，我们机关于半夜仓促转移了，出发时不知什么原因未找到他。拂晓敌人就包围了他住的这个庄子，一连几天不见下落，大家都为他着急，他姐姐哥哥更急的厉害。可是，有一天，他突然回来了。大家又高兴又惊奇。原来他那天晚间在一间堆稻草的草房里睡着了，天亮出房来一看，才发觉自己机关走了，立即被白匪抓起来。
    “赤匪的侦探！”
    “不……不是叫侦探，我是叫小叫化子。”郭滴海口吃地回答。白匪仔细打量着他的样子，突然抓住他的脖子，大喝一声：“妈的！还装傻呢！”另一个白匪军眨眨眼说：
  “拉去枪毙了，看他说不说实话！”郭滴海老实地对白匪军说他确实叫“小叫化子”。白匪军到他晚上睡觉的草房看了，看他的样子确实像个叫化子，就把他放了。从此，他就将计就计地在白匪军住地要饭吃，夜晚在草堆上睡觉。日子一天天过去，白匪军也不大注意他了。有一天，他趁机闯出村，在我们驻地附近碰到红军十二军的侦察员，他就把敌情详细报告了。后来这部分敌人也被红军十二军的部队消灭了，红军把他送回了原机关。同志们都说“小叫化子有胆量，有办法”。他姐姐说：“真可以当一名小侦察员了！”“不！已经算是小侦察英雄了！”同志们异口同声地夸他。从此以后，他有好几次化装叫化子，帮助红军十二军做侦察工作。
    一次敌人进攻根据地时，他去侦察临时据点。他带着破草帽，一手挽着破篮子，篮里盛着破碗，手里拿着一根打狗棒，从庄东头走到庄西头，沿门挨户，边要饭，边侦察，看那家住有多少敌人。当快要走到村尽头了，侦察也快完毕了，他心里暗暗乐吱吱的，口里还哼着小调。突然，匪军官从后面一把抓住他的衣领大喝一声：“站住！”简直把他提起来了似的，“他妈的！赤匪探仔，抓起来！”“走！”两个白匪兵押着他，带进一间屋子。“你是赤匪的探子吗？”郭滴海不慌不忙假装不懂地说：“什么叫探子？”当他说他是要饭的叫化子的时候，白匪军官说：“哼！前几天我们在那个庄子你来要饭，我们到了这个庄子，你也跟着来了，你还说不是赤匪探子是什么？！”他才知道敌人已发觉他跟纵敌人的事，但仍沉着地对白匪军说他确实是叫化子来要饭的。“不说实话枪毙你！”白匪军官掏出盒子枪，拉开机头，哗啦一声，子弹上了膛，对准郭滴海的脑袋，重复地威胁着：“说不说？”枪口在他的头顶敲了敲。他心里好像打鼓一样的扑通、扑通地直跳，心想这下可完蛋了，但仍然沉着地装着乞怜的样子，慢慢吞吞地哀求似的：“老总！你们一来，各村老百姓都跑光了，能要到什么吃的呢！要不是跟着老总，这些天不饿死了吗？”，又“咳！……”的长叹了一声。
    白匪军嘿嘿冷笑一声，威胁着：“别耍鬼花样了！再不说，活活打死你这狗杂种！”接着真的“啪”的一枪，把他脚旁的泥地打了一个洞。郭滴海本能地惊了一下，但他心一硬，坚定地说：“打死我也是个叫化子！”他假装着又怨又惊恐的样子。
    白匪军们上下打量了一番，互相望望眨眨眼睛，看看他那呆头呆脑的样子，那个白匪军官“哼”了一声，粗鲁地说：“给我滚！”一脚把郭滴海的要饭篮子，踢翻在地，残汤剩饭也溅满一地。
    “谢谢老总们开恩！”郭滴海赶快拾起碗筷和篮子，用手把溅在地上的剩饭也拾到碗里。
    “快给我滚出去！”白匪军官又是一脚踢在他屁股上。
    郭滴海也就乘机大踏步地，大大方方地走出大门，提着篮子，又到别家讨饭去了。
    第二天，第三天……郭滴海仍在这个白匪临时据点的庄里要饭，久而久之，竟和白匪军们混熟了。后来，那位白匪军官强迫他做侦探，替他们侦察红军的情报。他利用侦察红军的时候把敌人强迫他做侦探的事报告了当地党和游击队的首长。
    1931年的春天，上杭敌人钟绍奎的一个营在进攻苏区时，在上杭永定交界的红军根据地安上据点，日夜修筑碉堡、工事。郭滴海就把这种情况报告了县苏维埃政府主席。因为红军主力已转入其他地区作战，仅靠地方的红军独立团是攻打不下的，县里和独立团首长决定把敌人诱出来用埋伏战歼灭他。领导上决定要郭滴海利用给白匪军当侦察的条件，想法把敌人引诱出来。
    一天黄昏，县长、县委书记、红军独立团长向郭滴海交代了引出敌人的任务、办法，规定了伏击的地点、时间和信号。
    半夜晚，郭滴海气呼呼地跑到白匪军营部报告：“赤匪区长带了区中队（注）五六十个人半夜到了前面庄子。”白匪营长又问他距离多远，有多少人枪，白匪们议论纷纷，有说立即去袭击，捉区长；有说等明天拂晓再去，七嘴八舌喋喋不休。郭滴海在旁边焦急听着，就恐怕敌人不去，但还是不介意地盯着白匪军营长。白匪营长的副官对郭滴海说：“你再去侦察，看赤匪走了没有？！”
    “我怎敢再去呢！他们进庄来的时候都看见我了，我趁他们都分散各家睡觉的时候，就跑出来报告，我再去，不是白送死吗？”他坚定地但又是哀求似地回答了白匪军官。白匪营长犹疑了一会，半信半疑地对郭滴海问道：“确实分散到各家了吗？”
    “谁敢撒谎！……，我跟你们一起去看好了！”他毫不含糊地回答。
    白匪营长对副官使了个眼色，副官把郭滴海带出房去了。过了一会，白匪军营长从房里出来假装和蔼地对郭滴海说：“走！我同你去看赤匪是不是还在那里？”
    郭滴海仔细一瞧白匪军们正在集合了，心里暗暗欢喜。白匪军出发了，一个背着马枪的白匪传令兵跟着郭滴海走在前面带路，他并对郭滴海说：“当心你的脑袋，不要把路带错了！”“带好了，捉住凶手，赏你十块大洋！”白匪营长补充一句说。
    夜色笼罩着大地，天空闪烁着星光，沿途看不到一个村庄有一点灯光，群众都已空舍清野，连狗叫的声音也听不到，一片寂静。郭滴海一边小心地走着，一边想起了红色根据地的夜晚，现在时分，儿童团员、少先队员们，恐怕还在围着松油棍的熊熊灯火，同红军哥开联欢晚会呢，又唱歌又跳舞，又听红军讲战斗故事，是多么快乐啊！他越想越恨白匪；也越想越爱红军。他又暗自高兴：报仇的时候就到了！春风吹到脸上，心花怒放，回头一看，白匪军紧紧跟在后面。他也不自觉地加快了脚步，向隐隐约约的大山子丛林爬去。爬到半山腰了，白匪问他：“天快亮了，还有多少路？“翻过山，下山就到了。”除白匪军官催促匪兵快走的?喝外，谁也不敢说话。走着走着，快到山顶不远的地方，郭滴海看见从岩石堆和密林丛中微微闪着人影，他就一阵风似地钻进路旁的密林和乱石堆去了，一面大声喊：“打呀！打呀！”白匪军知道上当了，就朝密林乱打枪。埋伏在山里的红军独立团部队也向敌人开火了。郭滴海跑着跑着，忽然觉得一块石头打在他胳臂上，踉跄了几步就倒向前去了。
    一片激烈的枪声，手榴弹爆炸声，寂静的山林，顿时变成一片火海，夹杂着“冲呀！”“杀呀！”“缴枪不杀呀！”的口号，响彻山谷。白匪军手慌脚忙，七零八落，乱成一团。
    白匪军在黑夜中，摸不着头脑，恐慌万状，打死的打死，打伤的打伤，有的干脆爬在地下不起来，等着缴枪投降，从崖上跌下的也不少。战斗不到几十分钟的光景，二百多白匪军全部被我消灭了。
    天亮了，红色健儿们忙碌着打扫战场，收集枪枝、弹药，押送俘虏，就是没有看到郭滴海，大家都焦急得很。县委书记、团长派人到处找寻去了。四处寻找的战士们“小郭！”“小郭！”的呼唤声，震动山谷。终于战士们在密林中的乱石堆里找到了，大家像潮水样涌过来了。战士们抱起郭滴海，满脸的伤痕，鲜血从他的胳膀流出来。县委书记、团长也跑来了。书记把他一把抱在自己怀里，团长和军医们忙着救护，同志们看见他昏昏沉沉昏迷不醒的样子，都以沉重的心情，亲切地关怀着，泪水夺眶而出，书记的眼泪滴在小郭的脸上。一会小郭挣扎着慢慢睁开了眼，抬起头来看见自己的人，又听说白匪全被歼灭，高兴的笑起来。战士们一定要轮换背着郭滴海跟在押着俘虏、满载战斗胜利品的部队一同凯旋。从此侦察小英雄的事迹，就在闽西儿童团和少先队里传遍了。
  注：区中队，就是区党委区政府领
      导的游击队，约等于一个连；
      属县的游击队，叫独立团。
