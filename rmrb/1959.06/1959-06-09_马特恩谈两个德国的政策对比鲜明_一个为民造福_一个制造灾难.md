Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th. Materne, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber, spoke at a mass rally held on the 7th to celebrate the annual newspaper festival of "Neues Deutschland," the central organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Materne said that the government of the German Democratic Republic has repeatedly put forward practical and feasible proposals for resolving the German question, but they have been rejected by the Bonn government. They insist on opposing understanding and preparing for war. It is time to end this policy.

Materne emphasized that the achievements of socialist countries have changed the balance of world forces in favor of socialism. The German Democratic Republic's rapid economic achievements, increased political prestige, and the strength of the military forces defending the worker-peasant power have led to the de facto recognition of the German Democratic Republic. He said that by 1961, we will complete a major economic task: to catch up with and surpass West Germany in terms of per capita product output, thereby demonstrating the superiority of socialism. Adenauer and Strauss, on the other hand, want to complete nuclear armament by 1961. Our goal is to make everyone live better, while Adenauer and Strauss want to drag the German people back into the disaster of war. He said that as long as the peaceful will of the vast majority of West German residents prevails, Adenauer's dictatorship, hostile to freedom and peace, will come to an end.

Materne reiterated Ulbricht's proposal to welcome the foreign ministers of the four countries to visit the German Democratic Republic to learn about the living and working conditions of the residents.

Materne also called on those present to support the progressive newspaper staff who are suffering from persecution by the reactionary government.

Today, tens of thousands of residents from East and West Berlin participated in the newspaper festival celebrations in the democratic district of Berlin. An exhibition of the construction achievements of the German Democratic Republic was also held here. Representatives of many fraternal parties' newspapers participated in the celebrations.

    马特恩谈两个德国的政策对比鲜明
    一个为民造福　一个制造灾难
    新华社柏林7日电　德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、人民议院主席团第一副主席马特恩7日在为庆祝德国统一社会党中央机关报
  “新德意志报”一年一度的报纸节而举行的群众大会上发表了谈话。马特恩说，德意志民主共和国政府一再提出有关解决德国问题的切实可行的建议，但是，都遭到了波恩政府的拒绝。他们坚持反对谅解，准备战争。现在应该是结束这种政策的时候了。
    马特恩强调指出，目前社会主义国家的成就使世界力量的对比发生了有利于社会主义的变化。德意志民主共和国在经济方面的日新月异的成就、政治威望的提高和捍卫工农政权的军事力量的强大，使得德意志民主共和国得到了事实上的承认。他说，到1961年，我们要完成一项主要的经济任务：在按人口平均计算的产品产量上赶上并超过西德，从而显示社会主义的优越性。而阿登纳和施特劳斯之流到1961年却要完成原子武装。我们的目的是使人人生活得更好，而阿登纳、施特劳斯却要把德国人民重新拖入战争的灾难。他说，只要绝大多数西德居民的和平意志占了上风，阿登纳的敌视自由与和平的独裁统治就将告终。
    马特恩重申了乌布利希的建议，欢迎四国外长访问德意志民主共和国，来了解居民的生活和劳动情况。
    马特恩还号召到会的人声援那些遭受反动政府迫害的进步报纸工作人员。
    今天，东西柏林有数以万计的居民参加了柏林民主区庆祝报纸节的活动。这里还举办了德意志民主共和国建设成就展览会。许多兄弟党的党报都派代表参加了庆祝活动。
