Xinhua News Agency, June 25th:

    The Ministry of Coal Industry is focusing on tunneling and stripping work, striving for balanced, safe, high-yield, and high-quality production. Central government agencies, including the State Planning Commission, have jointly issued a notice to relevant departments in provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, urging them to immediately take measures to supply equipment for tunneling and other aspects of the coal industry on time, with quality, quantity, and in complete sets. The Ministry of Coal Industry recently held a telephone conference to further specifically arrange tunneling and production work.

    The specific requirements put forward by the Ministry of Coal Industry to various mines are to strengthen production preparation in three aspects: exploration, tunneling and stripping, and maintenance of roadways. General coal mines should strive to achieve a recoverable coal volume sufficient for six months of mining in the third quarter. Roadways affected by production, transportation, and safety due to issues such as stone slabs being damaged should be repaired within a short period.

    The Ministry of Coal Industry calls on the employees of coal mines across the country to tap the potential of tunneling work and achieve large-scale, high-speed tunneling. This is the best way to strengthen tunneling work under the existing conditions of manpower and equipment. The Ministry of Coal Industry pointed out that according to the analysis of the tunneling work in coal mines nationwide in March, the gap between advanced units and general units in tunneling work is still very large. The average monthly progress of all coal roadway tunneling nationwide is 138 meters, while the average of all coal roadways in seven mines, including Fengfeng No. 1 Mine, No. 2 Mine, and Huainan Datong Coal Mine, reached over 250 meters per month. The average monthly progress of semi-coal and semi-rock roadways nationwide is 96.97 meters, while seven mines, including Kailuan Linxi, reached 150 meters. The average monthly progress of rock roadway tunneling nationwide is 60.54 meters, while the average of all rock roadways in six mining bureaus, including Yangquan, Fuxin, Beipiao, Huainan, Zaozhuang, and Xinwen, reached over 80 meters per month. The tunneling progress of various roadways in these mines is 32% to 80% higher than the national average monthly progress of various roadways. This shows that the potential for tunneling is great, and it is entirely possible to achieve large-scale, high-speed tunneling. If the tunneling progress of coal mines nationwide increases by 10% on the existing basis, more than 310,000 meters can be tunneled in the second half of this year, which is equivalent to increasing the recoverable coal volume by more than 10 million tons without increasing personnel or equipment.

    While strengthening tunneling work, the Ministry of Coal Industry requires all coal mines to rationally use resources. At present, the recovery rate of some mines is still very low, which results in the loss of a lot of coal, wastes manpower and resources in tunneling roadways, and increases the tension in the connection between tunneling and mining. Therefore, increasing the recovery rate of coal mines can both increase production and save resources, and also alleviate the tension in the connection between tunneling and mining. If the recovery rate of each coal mine increases by 5% on the existing basis, the country can mine an additional 5 million tons of coal in the second half of this year, and it can save the roadways tunneled by 115 tunneling teams in one year.

    Now, some coal mines have taken measures to strengthen tunneling work according to the instructions of the Ministry of Coal Industry. From the Bureau to the mines, the Jingxing Mining Bureau has formed a core leadership team for tunneling work composed of the Party Secretary, Bureau Chief, Mine Manager, and Chief Engineer. Mining bureaus such as Jingxi, Fushun, Jingxing, and Fengfeng have initially formulated plans to strengthen tunneling work. The number of tunneling faces in Fengfeng Coal Mine has increased from 47 to 54, and exploration projects have been increased. Fushun Open-pit Mine has transferred some power shovels from the production side to strengthen stripping work. The tunneling footage in the first half of June in Jingxi Mining Bureau increased by more than 50% compared with the same period in May. The tunneling footage in the first half of June in Jingxing, Shuangyashan, and other mining bureaus has also increased compared with the same period in May.

    In order to strengthen tunneling work in the coal industry, so that the coal industry can produce more coal and better coal, the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the Ministry of Coal Industry have jointly issued a notice, requiring relevant departments in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to quickly take measures to supply equipment for tunneling and other aspects of the coal industry on time, with quality, quantity, and in complete sets. The notice requires all regions to immediately conduct a comprehensive and thorough inspection of the production of equipment ordered by the coal industry department, item by item. For equipment that is improperly arranged or not arranged, quickly adjust and arrange production. It is also required that the materials operated by the sales offices of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry in various regions should give priority to meeting the needs of the coal industry. The Ministry of Coal Industry will also transfer some workers from basic construction to strengthen tunneling work.

### 煤炭工业部号召狠抓掘进、剥离、生产、质量、安全  为国家开采更多更好的煤炭  要求有关部门采取措施按时按质按量和成套供应设备

    煤炭工业部号召狠抓掘进、剥离、生产、质量、安全
    为国家开采更多更好的煤炭
    要求有关部门采取措施按时按质按量和成套供应设备
    新华社25日讯　煤炭工业部狠抓掘进剥离工作，力争生产工作作到均衡、安全、高产、优质。国家计划委员会等中央机关也为此联合通知各省、市、自治区有关部门，立即采取措施，按时、按质、按量和成套地供应煤炭工业用于掘进等方面的设备。煤炭工业部又在最近召开了电话会议，更具体地布置了掘进和生产等工作。
    煤炭工业部向各矿提出的具体要求是，从开拓、掘进剥离和维修巷道等三方面加强生产准备工作。一般煤矿要在第三季度争取达到可供六个月开采的获得煤量；由于石?被压坏等原因影响生产、运输和安全的巷道，要在短期内修好。
    煤炭工业部号召全国煤矿的职工挖掘掘进工作的潜力，实现大面积高速掘进。这是在现有的人力和设备的条件下，加强掘进工作的最好的办法。煤炭工业部指出，根据全国煤矿3月份掘进工作情况的分析，在掘进工作方面，先进单位和一般单位悬殊还很大。全国所有煤巷掘进的平均月进度是一百三十八公尺，而峰峰一矿、二矿和淮南的大通煤矿等七个矿的全部煤巷，平均达到了月进二百五十公尺以上；全国半煤半岩的巷道掘进平均月进度是九十六点九七公尺，而开滦林西等七个矿则达到了一百五十公尺；全国岩巷掘进平均月进度是六十点五四公尺，而阳泉、阜新、北票、淮南、枣庄和新汶等六个矿务局，全部岩巷都达到了平均月进八十公尺以上。这些矿各种巷道的掘进进度，比全国各种巷道月进度分别高32％到80％。这就说明，掘进的潜力是很大的，实现大面积高速掘进是完全可能的。如果全国煤矿的掘进进度在现有的基础上提高10％，今年下半年就可以多掘进三十一万多公尺，即等于在不增人不增设备的情况下，多增加一千万吨以上的获得煤量。
    在加强掘进工作的同时，煤炭工业部要求各煤矿合理地使用资源。目前有些矿的回采率还很低，这样，既丢失很多煤，又浪费掘进巷道的人力物力，增加了掘进和采煤衔接的紧张情况。因此，煤炭工业提高回采率，既可增产又可节约，还可以缓和掘进和采煤衔接的紧张情况。如果各煤矿的回采率在现有的基础上提高5％，全国今年下半年就可以多采出五百万吨煤；可以节省一百一十五个掘进队掘进一年的巷道。
    现在，有些煤矿根据煤炭工业部的指示，采取了加强掘进工作的措施。井陉矿务局从局到矿，都由党委书记、局长和矿长、总工程师等组成领导掘进工作的核心。京西、抚顺、井陉、峰峰等矿务局已经初步作出了加强掘进工作的计划。峰峰煤矿的掘进工作面已由四十七个增加到五十四个，并且增加了开拓工程。抚顺露天矿已从生产方面抽调一部分电铲加强剥离工作。京西矿务局6月上半月比5月份同期掘进进尺增加了50％以上。井陉、双鸭山等矿务局6月上半月的掘进进尺比5月份同期也有所增加。
    为了加强煤炭工业中的掘进工作，使煤炭工业多产煤，产好煤，国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会、第一机械工业部和煤炭工业部，已联合发出通知，要求各省、市和自治区的有关部门，迅速采取措施，按时、按质、按量和成套地供应煤炭工业用于掘进等方面的设备。通知要求各地对煤炭工业部门所订设备的生产情况，立即逐项逐件地进行全面彻底地检查；对于安排不当或未作安排的设备，迅速调整和安排生产。并且要求第一机械工业部所属各地销售办事处经营的物资，尽先满足煤炭工业的需要。煤炭工业部还将从基本建设方面抽调一些工人，加强掘进工作。
