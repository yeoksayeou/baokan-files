Shanghai, 7th (report from our newspaper) Two enamel factories in Shanghai have almost identical objective conditions. However, due to different attitudes towards difficulties, different levels of drive, and different work methods, the production results are completely different.

One of these factories is Yifeng Enamel Factory: Leading personnel go deep into the masses and work with them to solve the difficulties of certain raw materials being of poor quality. The entire factory is full of drive. Since February of this year, output, quality, labor productivity, and profits turned over to the state have been increasing month by month, costs have been gradually decreasing, and the national plan has been comprehensively overfulfilled. The other is Zhonghua Enamel Factory: The leading personnel lack drive, emphasize difficulties, and do not go deep into the masses well in their work. As a result, output is not high, costs are rising, and quality is declining. In the industry-wide comparison in early April, it ranked last.

In terms of conditions, both Yifeng Factory and Zhonghua Factory are old enamel factories with over 30 years of history. They produce the same products, have similar scales, and have similar technical strengths. This year, they both encountered the difficulty of certain raw materials being of poor quality. For example, in the enamel industry, the main raw material, enamel powder, has many impurities and a hard powder consistency, making it easy for the finished enamel products to have black and white spots, sand holes, broken edges, and other problems, affecting the service life of the enamel products, and the color and luster are poor. The coal used is also of poor quality, resulting in weak firepower and low kiln temperatures. Enamel products explode during firing, and sometimes production is impossible due to low kiln temperatures.

The leading personnel of Yifeng Factory were not intimidated by the difficulties. They put forward the fighting slogan of "Set lofty aspirations, strive for high output and high quality, be the first in the industry, and go to Beijing in the autumn." The factory director and the Party branch secretary divided their responsibilities, one tackling the "enamel powder problem" and the other tackling the "kiln temperature problem," leading technical personnel and cadres deep into the production line. Zhonghua Factory was not like this. The leading cadres of this factory also wanted to take action and had held many cadre meetings for theoretical discussions. But after talking back and forth, the reason for the decline in quality was always "poor raw materials" and "technical complexity." Some even complained that "workers are not careful in their operations" and "the technical department did not mix the ingredients well." Moreover, the discussions were limited to the cadres, without consulting with the masses. The masses reflected: "The leaders are busy with meetings, and the production line is extremely anxious, but there is no solution."

In order to overcome the "enamel powder problem," the director of Yifeng Factory, along with technical personnel, worked on the production site, analyzing the root causes of the poor quality of the enamel powder together with the operators. At the same time, they strengthened the enamel powder mixing system, stipulating that the raw materials must be processed, treated, and tested before mixing; before putting them into production, a small batch production test must be carried out first. If the quality is qualified and approved by the factory director, large-scale production can be carried out. After taking these measures, the enamel powder quality problem was overcome. In Zhonghua Factory, in order to solve the enamel powder problem, the branch secretary, the factory director, and the chairman of the trade union all took a hand, but none of them seriously went deep into the masses to carefully analyze and study, and find the crux of the problem. After taking some action, seeing no effect, their confidence wavered. In the end, they had no choice but to entrust Yifeng Factory, Shanghai Acid-Resistant Enamel Factory, and other factories to burn enamel powder for them. The workers said dissatisfiedly: "Why can the brother factories burn enamel powder well, but we can't? Why doesn't the leadership organize us to visit and learn, so that everyone can use their brains and find the knack!"

In order to overcome the "kiln temperature problem," the general branch secretary of Yifeng Factory, who came from an old furnace worker background, went to the workshop and worked with the workshop branch secretary and the furnace workers, analyzing the causes together. After a week of exploration, they finally found the source of the problem. After research, they tried using the operating method of adding less, adding frequently, and adding evenly, and the kiln temperature rose. In Zhonghua Factory, although they had also organized employees to visit Jiu Xin Enamel Factory, the leadership did not follow through on how to specifically apply other people's experiences to the production of their own factory. As a result, other people's experiences remained theirs, and their own kiln temperature still could not be raised. The final solution was to send an urgent request to the Coal Construction Company, requesting a supply of good coal.

The leading cadres of Yifeng Factory also found that the output and quality were not balanced among the various teams and groups while going deep into the masses to solve key problems. Therefore, they decided that cadres should be responsible for helping workers summarize and exchange advanced experiences, so that each team and group could learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and narrow the gap. While carrying out mass movements in a big way, this factory also continuously strengthened management and improved the system. They established a system of "reporting every day, checking every ten days, and summarizing every month," and implemented a mass self-inspection and mutual inspection system combined with a full-time personnel inspection system for quality inspection, and so on. In Zhonghua Factory, there were also differences between the advanced and the backward among the workers. However, the leading cadres did not go deep enough to summarize advanced experiences and turn them into everyone's wealth.

Due to the different efforts made by the two factories, a clear contrast appeared in production. The value of output completed by Yifeng Enamel Factory: more than 640,000 yuan in February, 1.05 million yuan in March, 1.1 million yuan in April, and further increased to more than 1.11 million yuan in May. Qualified product rate (quality): 78% in February, 93% in March, 94% in April, and further increased to 95.07% in May. Labor productivity and profits turned over to the state also increased month by month. In Zhonghua Enamel Factory, it was a different scene: the value of output and labor productivity in the first quarter and April did not meet the plan, and the production cost in April was higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. The qualified product rate was only 63.38% in March, and further dropped to 46.58% in April, a difference of one time compared with Yifeng Factory. The workers felt very distressed. In the first half of May, the cadres of this factory checked their shortcomings and learned from Yifeng Factory. The quality situation has improved slightly compared with April, but the backward situation has not been fundamentally reversed.

    条件相近　干劲不同　结果两样益
    丰搪瓷厂干部群众同心协力月月优质高产
    中华搪瓷厂领导人员强调困难产量质量下降
    本报上海7日电　上海有两个客观条件几乎完全一样的搪瓷厂，由于对待困难的态度不同，干劲大小不同，工作方法不同，生产效果也完全两样。
    这两个工厂，一个是益丰搪瓷厂：领导人员深入群众，和群众一道解决某些原材料质量较差的困难，全厂上下干劲十足，今年2月以来，产量、质量、劳动生产率、上缴利润逐月上升，成本逐步下降，全面超额完成了国家计划。另一个是中华搪瓷厂：领导人员干劲不足，强调困难，工作中没有很好地深入群众，因而产量不高，成本上升，质量下降，在4月上旬的同行业评比中名列最末。
    论条件，益丰厂和中华厂都是三十多年的老搪瓷厂，产品相同，规模相仿，技术力量也差不多，今年同样碰到了某些原材料质量较差的困难。例如搪瓷行业中的主要原料琅粉，由于杂质多、粉性硬，做出的搪瓷品容易出黑白点、砂眼、碎边等毛病，影响搪瓷品的使用寿命，而且颜色光泽差。用的煤，质量也较差，因而火力不旺，窑温不高，搪瓷品在烘烧时发生爆裂现象，有时候甚至会由于窑温不高，无法生产。
    益丰厂的领导人员没有被困难吓倒，他们提出“立定雄心大志，力争高产又优质，行业第一、秋后上北京”的战斗口号，厂长和党总支书记分工包干，一个攻“琅粉关”，一个攻“窑温关”，分别带了技术人员和干部深入下去。中华厂则不是这样。这个厂的领导干部也想抓，也曾经开过不少次干部会议，进行务虚。但谈来谈去总是质量下降的原因是“原料不好”、“技术性复杂”，有的还埋怨“工人操作不当心”、“技术科配料没配好”。而且只是停留在干部中间议论来议论去，没有和群众一起议论。群众反映：“上面开会忙煞，下面生产急煞，就是没有办法。”
    为了攻克“琅粉关”，益丰厂的厂长带着技术人员，就在生产现场办公，和操作工人一起，细致地分析了琅粉质量差的根源。同时，加强了琅粉的配料制度，规定必须把原料经过加工处理和化验合格才能配料；投入生产以前，必须先作小批生产的试验，如果质量合格，经过厂长批准，才能大批生产。采取这些措施以后，琅粉质量关就攻下来了。而在中华厂，为了解决琅粉问题，支部书记、厂长和工会主席都抓过一下，但是谁都没有认真地深入群众去仔细分析研究，找出症结所在。抓了一下，不见效果，他们的信心也动摇了。最后没有办法，干脆委托益丰厂、上海耐酸搪瓷厂等厂替他们代烧琅粉。工人不满意地说：“为什么兄弟厂的琅粉烧得好，我们烧不好！领导上为什么不组织我们去参观学习，大家来动动脑筋，找找窍门呢！”
    为了攻克“窑温关”，益丰厂老炉工出身的总支书记下到车间以后，和车间支部书记同炉工一起劳动，同炉工一起分析原因。经过一个星期的摸索，终于摸到了病源。他们经过研究，试用加得少、加得勤、加得匀的操作方法，窑温就上升了。而在中华厂，虽然也曾经组织职工到久新搪瓷厂去参观，但是，怎样把人家的经验具体运用到本厂的生产上来，领导上没有抓下去，结果，人家的经验还是人家的，自己的窑温仍然烧不高。最后的办法，还是向煤建公司告急，要求供应好煤。
    益丰厂的领导干部在深入群众解决关键问题中，还发现各个班、各个小组之间的产量和质量不平衡，于是又确定干部负责帮助工人总结和交流先进经验，使各班各组互相取长补短，缩短差距。这个厂在大搞群众运动的同时，还不断加强管理，健全制度。他们建立了“天天抓汇报、旬旬抓检查、月月抓总结”的制度，实行了群众性的自检互检和专职人员检查相结合的质量检验制度等等。在中华厂工人中，同样也存在有先进与落后的差别。但是，领导干部就是没有很好深入下去，总结先进经验，使之变为大家的财富。
    由于两个厂所作的努力不同，生产上就出现了鲜明的对照。益丰搪瓷厂完成的产值：2月份六十四万余元，3月份一百零五万元，4月份一百一十万元，5月份再上升到一百一十一万余元。正品率（质量）：2月份78％，3月份93％，4月份94％，5月份再上升到95.07％。劳动生产率、上缴利润也是逐月上升。而在中华搪瓷厂则是另外一番景象：第一季度和4月份的产值和劳动生产率都未完成计划，生产成本4月份比去年第四季度高。正品率3月份只有63.38％，4月份更下降到46.58％，比益丰厂相差一倍。工人群众感到很痛心。5月上半月，这个厂的干部检查了自己的缺点，并向益丰厂学习后，完成质量的情况比4月份已稍有好转，但是还未根本扭转落后局面。
