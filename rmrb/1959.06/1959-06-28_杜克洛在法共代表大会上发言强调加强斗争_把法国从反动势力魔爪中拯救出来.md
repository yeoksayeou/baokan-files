Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 26th: The Fifteenth Congress of the French Communist Party continued its discussion of Maurice Thorez's report today (the third day).

	In the morning session, Central Committee Secretary Marcel Servin focused his speech on the current struggle of republicans and working people against personal autocracy. Servin emphasized that the communists are convinced that they can achieve final victory, and this belief is based on the communists' unwavering trust in the working class and the people's strength.

	Servin said that in the past year, all strata of residents, except for a small group of bankers and representatives of monopoly capital, have been harmed by de Gaulle's policies. This situation makes the realization of a broad alliance truly possible. The Communist Party made a correct judgment based on facts, especially after the recent "referendum," when the party pointed out that the 17 million voters who voted in favor should not be regarded as a reactionary mass. The municipal elections proved the party's increased standing, proved the possibility of unity, and made the masses believe that personal autocracy is not unbreakable.

	Servin listed facts to illustrate that in the past four months, the movement against the scourge of de Gaulle's policies has developed. He said that the autocratic system has failed to paralyze the people's strength, and now, the mass movement against the consequences of de Gaulle's policies far exceeds the scope of what is called the "left wing." Only when this movement develops to a huge scale can it lead to the restoration of democracy. Servin believes that the scale of this movement will far exceed the people's movement in the "Popular Front" era of 1936.

	The Congress also read out the congratulatory message from the Communist Party of Germany, which was illegally banned by the Adenauer government of West Germany, and the congratulatory message from the Algerian Communist Party at the morning session. The congratulatory message from the Algerian Communist Party was full of exciting, warm patriotism and fraternal internationalism. The congratulatory message emphasized that it is possible to restore true and just peace between France and Algeria through negotiations, thereby establishing a new relationship between the people of the two countries.

	The representatives of fraternal parties who spoke at today's meeting included: Todd, the representative of the British Communist Party, and Sándor Gáspár, the representative of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

	The afternoon session was presided over by Political Bureau member Roger Garaudy. Political Bureau member Léon Feix, in his speech, demanded the restoration of peace in Algeria. He reiterated the Communist Party's position, saying that negotiations with those fighting against it would be possible as long as the government recognized Algeria's right to independence. He also argued for the practical significance of holding negotiations, saying, why wait? What are we waiting for? To have the United Nations or France's allies forcibly impose a solution? It is best for the French and Algerians to resolve this tragedy in a friendly manner.

	French Communist Party Secretary Duclos analyzed in detail the background of the current French government in his speech. Duclos said that de Gaulle and his family are linked to large commercial banks. Among his ministers, advisors, and economic experts, there are direct agents of financial capital who have usurped important positions under the so-called parliamentary system, as well as representatives of monopoly capital groups commanded by bankers and professional politicians. Like in the United States, big banks and big industrialists control the government and diplomacy.

	Duclos then analyzed the role of the army and the church in this regime, pointing out how this regime is leading the country onto a dangerous path of fascism.

	In the second part of his speech, Duclos talked about the prospects for the French Communist Party to save the country from the clutches of regressive political and economic forces, thereby restoring and innovating democracy. He said that this can only be achieved through large-scale political struggles, and he called on the working class and the people to join this struggle.

	Duclos outlined the French Communist Party's program that the Congress will submit to the French people for adoption, and explained how unity between the working class and democratic forces can be achieved around this program. Duclos made it clear: "It is not about going back to the past, because the past is the stepping stone to personal autocracy. We must not only restore democracy, but also innovate democracy. What we want is a democracy that recognizes the due status of the working class in the government and in the country.

	Duclos finally pointed out that one day, the French people will demand the dissolution of the parliament that does not represent the country, and demand the election of a constituent assembly by proportional representation to end personal autocracy and restore and innovate democracy.

    杜克洛在法共代表大会上发言强调加强斗争
    把法国从反动势力魔爪中拯救出来
    新华社巴黎26日电　法国共产党第十五次代表大会今天（第三日）继续讨论多列士的报告。
    在上午会议上，中央委员会书记马赛尔·赛尔文在发言中着重论述了共和人士和劳动人民反对个人专权的当前斗争情况。赛尔文强调说，共产党人确信能取得最后胜利，这种信念的根据是共产党人对工人阶级和人民力量的不可动摇的信任。
    赛尔文说，一年以来，除了一小撮银行家和垄断资本的代表外，各个阶层的居民都受到了戴高乐政策的损害。这种情况使实现广泛的联盟真正有了可能。共产党曾经确有根据地作出了正确的判断，特别是在刚刚举行“公民投票”之后，当时党就指出，不要把一千七百万投赞成票的选民看成是反动群众。市政选举证明了党的地位的提高，证明了团结的可能性，市政选举使群众相信，个人专权不是牢不可破的。
    赛尔文列举事实说明，四个月以来，反对戴高乐政策的祸害的运动有了发展，他说，专制制度未能使人民力量瘫痪，现在，反对戴高乐政策后果的群众运动，远远超过了人们称之为“左翼”的范围。这种运动发展到规模巨大的时候，才能导向恢复民主。赛尔文认为，这个运动的规模将远远超过人所共知的1936年“人民阵线”时代的人民运动。
    大会还在上午会议上宣读了被西德阿登纳政府非法禁止的德国共产党的贺电和阿尔及利亚共产党的贺电，阿尔及利亚共产党的贺电充满着令人激动的热烈的爱国主义和亲如兄弟的国际主义的情绪，贺电强调指出，通过谈判，恢复法国同阿尔及利亚之间真正的和公正的和平，从而建立两国人民之间新的关系，这是可能的。
    在今天会上致词的兄弟党代表有：英国共产党代表杜德和匈牙利社会主义工人党代表山多尔·加莱。
    下午会议由政治局委员罗歇·加罗迪主持，政治局委员莱昂·费克斯在发言中要求恢复阿尔及利亚的和平，他重申共产党的立场，他说，只要政府承认阿尔及利亚的独立权利，同与之作战的人们谈判将是可能的。他还论证了举行谈判的现实意义，他说，为什么等待呢？等待什么呢？要联合国或法国的盟国强行规定一个解决办法吗？最好是由法国人和阿尔及利亚人友好地来解决这个悲剧。
    法国共产党书记杜克洛在发言中详细地分析了法国现政府的背景，杜克洛说，戴高乐和他的家庭是同大商业银行有联系的。在他的部长、顾问和经济专家当中，有在所谓议会制度下窃据着机要职位的金融资本的直接代理人，还有受银行家和职业政客指挥的垄断资本集团的代表。像在美国一样，大银行和大工业家掌握着政权和外交。
    杜克洛接着分析了军队和教会在这个政权中所起的作用，指出这个政权怎样使国家走上法西斯化的危险道路。
    杜克洛在他的发言的第二部分里，谈到法共为把国家从倒行逆施的政治和经济势力的魔爪中拯救出来，从而恢复和革新民主的前景。他说，这只有进行大规模的政治斗争才能实现，他号召工人阶级和人民投入这场斗争。
    杜克洛概述了大会将提交法国人民采纳的法共纲领，并且说明，怎样才能够围绕着这纲领，实现工人阶级和民主力量的团结。杜克洛明确指出：“不是要回到过去的状态中去，因为过去的状态正是个人专权的踏脚石。我们不仅要恢复民主，还要革新民主。我们要的是这样一种民主：承认工人阶级在政府中的应有地位、在全国的应有地位。
    杜克洛最后指出，总有一天，法国人民将要求解散不代表全国的议会，要求按照比例代表制选出一个制宪议会，来结束个人专权，恢复和革新民主。
