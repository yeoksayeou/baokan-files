Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The support telegram from workers in the Chinese capital to all German worker brothers is as follows:

To the Free German Trade Union Federation and all German Worker Brothers:

The workers in the capital of the People's Republic of China held a rally today to express their firm support for the German workers' struggle to conclude a German peace treaty and their full support for the efforts made by the European Trade Union and Labor People's Representatives Conference held in Görlitz on the Oder-Neisse River from May 8th to 10th, 1959, at the initiative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to demand a peaceful resolution of the German issue and to safeguard European security and world peace.

Peace is indivisible. The signing of a German peace treaty is not only related to the happiness of the German people but also to European security and world peace. Therefore, we express our highest respect to the German worker brothers for their struggle to conclude a German peace treaty, oppose the revival of West German militarism, and strive to establish a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany. Your struggle not only expresses the determination of the entire German people to defend peace but also embodies the common aspirations of peace-loving people around the world. The workers in the Chinese capital and the workers and people of the whole country have always fully supported the Soviet government's proposals for concluding a German peace treaty and all the measures and unremitting efforts taken by the government of the German Democratic Republic and the workers and people of the whole of Germany to this end.

The Chinese workers and people resolutely demand that the ongoing Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference make positive contributions to the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the peaceful settlement of the West Berlin issue. We believe that a German peace treaty must be signed, and the occupation system in West Berlin must be abolished. If the Western countries and the West German authorities stubbornly persist in their already bankrupt Cold War plans at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and continue to unreasonably play with "package deals" and refuse the proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, they will only more thoroughly expose their true colors of delaying and obstructing the peaceful settlement of the German issue. They will inevitably be further severely condemned by all peace-loving people in the world and must bear full responsibility for undermining the peaceful settlement of the German issue.

The Chinese workers and people vow to be the backing of the German workers and people, resolutely stand together with you and the peace-loving people of the world, and persist in the struggle to conclude a German peace treaty and defend European and world peace.

    中国工人誓为德国兄弟后盾
    中国首都工人给全德工人兄弟的支援电
    新华社9日讯　中国首都工人给全德工人兄弟的支援电，全文如下：自由德国工会联合会转全体德国工人兄弟：
    中华人民共和国首都工人今天举行集会，表示坚决支持德国工人争取缔结对德和约的斗争，全力支持根据世界工联的倡议于1959年5月8日—10日在奥德—尼斯河畔格里兹城举行的欧洲工会和劳动人民代表会议为要求和平解决德国问题，维护欧洲安全和世界和平所作的努力。
    和平是不可分割的。对德和约的签订不仅关系到德国人民的幸福，也关系到欧洲的安全和世界和平。因此，我们对德国工人兄弟在为争取缔结对德和约，反对西德军国主义复活，争取建立一个统一的、和平的、民主的德国的斗争表示崇高的敬意。你们的斗争不仅表达了全德人民保卫和平的决心，同时也体现了全世界爱好和平人民的一致愿望，中国的首都工人和全国工人及人民一贯全力支持苏联政府关于缔结对德和约的建议和德意志民主共和国政府和全德工人和人民为此而采取的一切措施和不懈的努力。
    中国工人和人民坚决要求正在进行的日内瓦外长会议对缔结对德和约和和平解决西柏林问题作出积极的贡献。我们认为：对德和约必须签订，西柏林的占领制度必须废除。如果西方国家和西德当局仍顽固地在外长会议上坚持其早已破产了的冷战计划，继续无理地玩弄“一揽子计划”而拒绝苏联和德意志民主共和国的建议，只能更彻底地暴露出他们拖延和阻挠和平解决德国问题的真面目，他们必将进一步遭到世界一切爱好和平的人民的严厉谴责，必须对破坏德国问题的和平解决负全部责任。
    中国工人和人民誓为德国工人和人民的后盾，坚决和你们及全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起，为争取缔结对德和约，保卫欧洲和世界和平而坚持斗争。
