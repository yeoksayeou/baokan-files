Inner Mongolia reports a bumper lamb crop. The region delivered a total of more than 7.25 million lambs this year, of which more than 6.54 million were healthy and survived, an increase of 2 million compared with the same period last year.

Currently, from Hulunbuir League in the east to Bayannur League in the west, the grasslands stretching for thousands of miles are covered with lush grass, and large flocks of lambs are growing rapidly.

The characteristics of Inner Mongolia's lamb breeding work this year are the high survival rate and good quality of the lambs. At the same time, many high-yield flocks and records of multiple births in one litter have appeared. This year, the average lamb survival rate in the region reached more than 90 percent.
