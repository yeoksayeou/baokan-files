Grow More Summer Sweet Potatoes, Raise More Fat Pigs
Giving pigs more good feed so they grow faster and fatter is the best way to save feed and increase income.

Both the tubers and stems and leaves of sweet potatoes are good pig feed. The tubers are rich in nutrients, especially carbohydrates, and four catties are worth more than one catty of corn, making them a good feed for fattening pigs. Green sweet potato vines contain nutrients equivalent to tofu dregs and are popular with boars, sows, and barrows.

When raising pigs, we should not only consider the number of heads, but also make sure pigs gain weight quickly. Within a certain feeding period, giving pigs more good feed so they grow faster and fatter than giving them less good feed so they grow slowly and are not fat can save feed consumption, reduce costs, and increase the benefits of raising pigs. Pigs that grow fast can be sold earlier, which not only leads to a higher commodity rate, but also faster turnover. According to experiments by the Institute of Animal Husbandry of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, using 366 catties of mixed feed to feed pigs, the average feed required to produce one catty of meat is 6.3 catties, with a cost of 2 jiao 8 fen 5. Using 261.8 catties of mixed feed plus 112 catties of rice husks (very low in nutrition) for feeding, each catty of pork produced requires 11.7 catties of feed, 5.4 catties more than the former, and the cost is 4 jiao, 1 jiao 1 fen 5 higher than the former.

The fatness or leanness of the pig is directly related to the selling price. According to the pig purchase situation in Shangshui County, Henan Province this year, pigs with the same live weight of 150 catties, the lean ones sell for 10 yuan 0 jiao 6 fen 5 less than the fat ones. This is because leaner pigs have a lower meat yield and lower purchase price; fatter pigs have a higher meat yield and higher purchase price. The reason why fatter pigs can sell for more money is simply because they are raised fatter and produce twenty-five catties more meat. It is not difficult to make leaner pigs grow twenty-five catties more meat; in the same feeding period, simply add 270 catties of fresh sweet potatoes during the fattening stage. People's communes or production teams should appropriately expand the area of summer-sown sweet potatoes according to their own circumstances, and produce more sweet potatoes, so that pigs can be raised fatter. This can not only increase the supply of meat, but also increase cash income, which is truly a win-win situation.

There are many ways to use sweet potatoes to feed pigs. Fresh ones can be washed, chopped and fed raw, or cooked until half-cooked. If you can't finish feeding them all at once, you can also ensile them. The advantage of ensiling sweet potatoes is that it can reduce self-loss during storage and prevent a large amount of rot caused by black spot disease.

    多种夏薯　多养肥猪
    多给猪一些好饲料，让它长得快、长得肥，才是节省饲料，增加收益的好办法。
    甘薯的块根和它的茎叶都是养猪的好饲料，薯块含有丰富的养分，特别是碳水化合物，四斤可以顶上一斤玉米还多，是育肥猪的好饲料。青薯藤所含养分也相当于豆腐渣，无论公猪、母猪、克郎猪都喜欢吃。
    养猪不仅要头数多，还应当考虑使猪增重快。在一定的饲养时间内，多给猪一些好饲料，使它长的快、长的肥，比少给些好饲料长的慢而且不肥，能够节省饲料的消耗，降低成本，增加养猪的收益。猪长的快，能提前出圈，不但商品率高，同时周转也快。根据中国农业科学院畜牧研究所试验，用三百六十六斤混合饲料喂猪，平均每生产一斤肉需饲料六点三斤，成本二角八分五。用二百六十一点八斤混合饲料加上一百一十二斤稻壳（营养很低）饲养，每生产一斤猪肉需饲料十一点七斤，比前者多消费五点四斤饲料，成本四角，比前者高一角一分五。
    猪的肥和瘦，直接关系到售价的高低。根据河南商水县今年生猪收购情况，同是活重一百五十斤的猪，瘦的比肥的少卖十元零六角五分。这是因为较瘦的猪出肉率低，收价低；较肥的猪出肉率高，收价高。较肥的猪所以能够多卖钱，无非是养的肥一些，多出二十五斤多肉。使较瘦的猪多长二十五斤多肉，是不难的，在同一饲养期，只在催肥阶段加喂二百七十斤鲜甘薯就可以了。人民公社或生产队根据自己的情况适当扩大夏种甘薯的面积，多产甘薯，就能够把猪养得更肥。这样不仅可以增加肉食供应，还可以增加现金收入，真是一举数得。
    使用甘薯喂猪的方法很多。鲜的可以洗净切碎生喂或者煮半熟喂。一时喂不完的，也可以青贮起来。青贮甘薯的好处是：可以减少窖贮期内自身损失和防止因黑斑病造成的大量腐烂。
