    Bao Cheng Instrument Factory Establishes System, Organizes Workers for Strict Review
    Every Part Must Pass the Quality Check
    (Our Dispatch) The state-owned Shaanxi Bao Cheng Instrument Factory is vigorously carrying out a mass movement for "parts quality to pass the test," conducting strict reviews of every part, thereby comprehensively improving product quality.
    Since the factory launched the "parts quality pass the test" campaign in mid-April, as of May 17, more than 90% of the factory's more than 1,200 parts with quality problems have "passed the test." Due to the improvement in the quality of the parts, of the thirty-four instruments assembled in the first half of May, all but one that was returned for repair once, met the specified requirements. In the previous four months, almost every such instrument had to undergo several repairs before it could leave the factory. All of the parts from the Eighth Workshop passed the test, and in the process, the workers put forward more than 1,400 specific measures to improve quality. After sixty-five of these measures were implemented, not only did the products reach high quality, but they also ensured high output, and work efficiency increased by two to twenty times.
      "Parts pass the test" generally takes the form of group meetings. In addition to the members of the group, the participants include leading cadres of the workshop or section, processing technicians, assembly technicians, and quality supervisors. When a part "passes the test," the process data of the part, the actual objects scrapped due to different reasons, and good quality finished products are all placed on the table. The manufacturing workers begin by reporting the number of rejects, the process, their own analysis of the reasons for the rejects, and what improvement measures should be taken according to their opinions. Then, everyone analyzes carefully, based on the defective products and the manufacturer's report, whether the reasons for the poor quality are those he proposed. If not, they continue to look for them. After finding the reasons for the low quality, after everyone jointly researches improvement measures, those that can be implemented immediately are implemented immediately. Those that cannot be resolved immediately, such as modifying process designs or modifying molds and fixtures, are also assigned to specific personnel on the spot to be responsible for solving them regularly. Differences of opinion and unresolved disputes are resolved separately. If the problem is operational and needs to be improved by the individual, if his skills are not proficient, a special person is assigned to guide him. When the Fourth Joint Group of the First Workshop processed a certain part, it was necessary to soak it before processing according to the process regulations, but some people did not soak it, so the surface was very dirty after processing, and it had to be scraped with a knife, resulting in a large number of defective products. After inspection, everyone operated in accordance with the process regulations, ensuring 100% quality. The scrap rate of a certain part in the Eighth Workshop was very high during processing. After "parts quality passed the test," it was found that the main reason was that the processing aspect was unreasonable. After changing the process, not only was the quality guaranteed, but the work efficiency was also increased by more than twenty times.
    In order to ensure product quality, the factory leadership also strengthened the technical department according to production needs and re-established the product inspection department and the design department. Inspection rooms (groups) were established in each workshop, equipped with an appropriate number of full-time inspectors, combining full reliance on the conscious inspection of the broad masses of workers and full-time inspection work. The two-inspection system, the raw material incoming inspection system, the defective product handling system, the regular inspection system for tools, molds, measuring tools, and instruments and equipment were improved, and the first product inspection system, sampling inspection system, and mobile inspection system were resolutely implemented. The approval authority for substitute materials, excessive tolerances, design reforms, and processing methods was stipulated. These rules and regulations were distributed to the masses of workers, and organized for airing, debate, and discussion, so that everyone could supplement and revise them, and implement them in production. This overcame the state of no one managing the inspection work for a time, strengthened the sense of responsibility of each worker for product quality, and guaranteed the improvement of product quality from the organization.

### 宝成仪表厂建立制度组织职工进行严格审查  每个零件都要过质量关

    宝成仪表厂建立制度组织职工进行严格审查
    每个零件都要过质量关
    本报讯　国营陕西省宝成仪表厂大搞“零件质量过关”的群众运动，对每个零件都进行严格审查，从而全面地提高了产品质量。
    这个厂自4月中旬开展“零件质量过关”的运动以来，到5月17日为止，全厂质量有问题的一千二百多项零件，90％以上的都已经过了“关”。由于零件质量提高，5月份中上旬装起的一种仪表三十四个，除其中一个返修过一次以外，全部合乎规定要求，而在前四个月这种仪表几乎每个都要经过数次返修才能出厂。八车间质量的零件全部过了关，在过关过程中，职工共提出了一千四百多项提高质量的具体措施。其中六十五项措施实现以后，不但使产品达到了优质，而且保证了高产，工效提高了二倍至二十倍不等。
      “零件过关”一般都是采取小组会的方式。参加的人除本小组的成员以外，还有车间或工段的领导干部、加工工艺员、装配工艺员和质量监督员参加。那种零件“过关”，就把事先准备好的有关这种零件的工艺资料、由于不同原因报废的实物和质量好的成品，全放在桌面上。开始由制造的工人报告报废数量、经过和他自己对报废原因的分析，以及按照他的意见应该采取什么改进措施。然后，大家就根据废品和制造人的报告，细致地分析质量不好的原因是不是他提出的那些，如果不是，就继续寻找。找出质量不高的原因，大家共同研究出改进措施以后，能够立即实施的，就立即实施，不能马上解决的如修改工艺设计或修改工夹模具等，也当场指定专人负责，定期解决。意见不一致、争执不下的，另行专门解决。其中属于操作上的问题要由本人改进的，假若他技术不熟练，便指定专人辅导。一车间四联小组加工某项零件时，按工艺规程先要浸洗后才能加工，可是有人不经过浸洗，因此加工后表面很脏，必须用刀刮，造成大量废品。经过检查以后，大家都按工艺规程规定操作，百分之百地保证了质量。八车间有一种零件加工中报废率很大，经过“零件质量过关”，找出原因主要是加工方面不合理，经过改变工序，不但保证了质量，工效还提高二十倍以上。
    为了保证产品质量，这个厂的领导方面还根据生产需要加强了技术科的力量，重新建立了产品检验科和设计科。各车间成立了检验室（组），配备了适当数量的专职检验人员，把充分依靠广大职工群众的自觉检查和专职检验工作结合起来。将二检制、原材料入厂检查制度、废品处理制度、工模量具和仪器设备定期检查制度等健全起来，坚决推行第一个产品检验制、抽检制、流动检验制等等。规定了代料、超差、改革设计、加工方法的批准权限。并把这些规章制度发给职工群众，组织鸣放辩论，让大家补充修改，切实在生产中贯彻。这就克服了检验工作一度无人管理的状态，加强了每个职工对产品质量的责任心，从组织上保证了产品质量的提高。
