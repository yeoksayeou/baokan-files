Hatred in Guatemala
Zhou Erfu

Beside the vast, ocean-like Milky Way, there is a quiet Juan Beles Avenue, lined with towering, verdant trees, walking into this avenue is like entering a forest. Behind the trees are various styles of western-style houses. On the right, there is a two-story western-style house, entering the door is a large dining room and living room connected together. I walked in, the host warmly shook my hand tightly, and said very kindly:
"I was very happy to hear that you came to Uruguay. We have met Chinese friends here."

From his kind conversation and refined demeanor, no one would ever think that he was a soldier, a colonel, former President Arbenz of Guatemala, who in 1944 led the struggle to overthrow the then Guatemalan dictatorial government. On March 15, 1951, with the unanimous support of the Communist Party, other progressive parties, and various progressive groups, he was elected president, established a national bourgeois regime, and implemented bourgeois democratic reforms.

Eight years ago, the victory of the Guatemalan revolution not only opened a new page in the history of this country, which had long been enslaved by the "Green Devil" - the United Fruit Company of America, but also shook the rule of American imperialism in Latin America. At that time, people all over the world paid close attention to the situation in Guatemala and admired the heroic spirit of the Guatemalan people. Therefore, when I saw Mr. Arbenz, I couldn't help but feel a kind of admiring cordiality from the bottom of my heart.

Although the Guatemalan revolution was suppressed by American interventionists. However, the revolutionary flame of the Guatemalan people, and the deeds of the Arbenz government's struggle against American interventionists with the support of the people, cannot be erased by any force.

How vigorous was the vigor and vitality of the Guatemalan people after the victory of the revolution in those years. The number of votes Mr. Arbenz received as president was almost equal to twice the total number of votes of his nine competitors. This was also unprecedented in Guatemalan election history, fully reflecting the strong will and hope of the people. After he took office as president, in order to realize the wishes of the people, the Congress passed many resolutions to develop the national economy and formulated a five-year plan. The main part of this plan was land reform. The Land Reform Law stipulated that no matter what form of lease was used, all leased land owned by feudal landlords and foreign companies, with an area of more than one hundred and eighty hectares, or large plantations with one-third of the area not cultivated, would be distributed to agricultural workers, landless and land-poor peasants. The peasants formed a three-person committee to carry out land distribution. 55,700 people were allocated land, obtaining 530,000 hectares, of which 160,000 hectares were previously occupied by the "Green Devil." The landowners whose land was confiscated were given certain compensation by the government, which was paid by issuing "Land Reform Bonds". President Arbenz himself also had a lot of land, and he was the first to hand it over for distribution.

His progressive policies and measures with national bourgeois characteristics were supported by the people of the whole country and caused a huge impact in Latin America. Naturally, there were also some people who were extremely hateful, and these were the Wall Street bosses and their lackeys who lived by drinking the blood and sweat of others. The White House master, who was prone to aggression, vowed not to give up, so he drew up a conspiracy plan to subvert the democratic government of Arbenz.

I would like to understand the American imperialist conspiracy against Guatemala, which would be helpful to understand the current situation in Cuba. But Mrs. Arbenz invited me to the dining room for dinner. She seemed to know my intention and said with a smile: "Let's talk while eating."

She is not only a shrewd housewife, but also a skilled diplomat. She once studied in the United States and speaks very fluent English. She personally arranged for them to invite me to dinner tonight. I sat down at the table, and the first thing that caught my attention was that there were chopsticks in front of everyone, which she had prepared especially for Chinese friends. After I finished the rich and delicious cold dish, followed by a bowl of thick soup, the taste reminded me of Chinese beef soup. I said to Mrs. Arbenz:
"This soup tastes very good."
A satisfied smile appeared on her face.

So I talked to Mr. Arbenz again about the American imperialist conspiracy to subvert Guatemala. After Arbenz took office as president, the Wall Street bosses began to carry out subversive activities. By the spring of 1953, they saw that the people of Guatemala, under the leadership of President Arbenz, had embarked on a prosperous road, and the United States' economic monopoly and political dominance in Guatemala were shaken. At that time, Secretary of State Dulles and the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, who was also a shareholder of the United Fruit Company and the person in charge of the "Green Devil's" external relations, Braxton, couldn't help but openly clamor for armed intervention in Guatemala. In March of the same year, the US government formally came forward. Arbenz received a special note from the US State Department, openly stating that the United States had the right to demand compensation for the land formerly occupied by the United Fruit Company that had been distributed to the Guatemalan people. Then, the United States appointed the executioner who strangled the Greek people's revolutionary movement, American Ambassador to Greece, Preevifoy, as the American ambassador to Guatemala. The new official took office with three fires, and this "ambassador" certainly stepped up subversive activities to show the talent of the executioner. The United States also used the "Organization of American States" it manipulated to carry out intervention activities. The Tenth Pan-American Conference held in Caracas, Venezuela in March 1954, passed the so-called "Declaration on Maintaining Political Solidarity of American States Against Interference by International Communism", which created a "legal" basis for intervention in Guatemala. After the "Declaration" was passed, the United States indeed further strengthened the preparations for armed intervention. First of all, it started the rumor and smear machine, created public opinion, saying that "a large number of Soviet arms have arrived in Guatemala," and that "the Guatemalan government incited banana workers in Honduras to strike" and other lies; at the same time, it forced Guatemala's neighbors Honduras and Nicaragua to sign "military mutual assistance agreements," and also asked these two countries to sever diplomatic relations with Guatemala. On the other hand, American imperialism secretly equipped and trained its agent, the Amas rebel army, in Honduras as a preparation for armed intervention.

The Guatemalan people and President Arbenz had long seen through the aggressive face of American imperialism and were wary of the White House's subversive conspiracy. During the three years and more of President Arbenz's tenure, he led the Guatemalan people to smash thirty subversive activities by the White House.

On June 18, 1954, Colonel Amas, a bandit personally trained by the United States, led more than two thousand rebels and, with the assistance of the US Air Force, invaded Guatemala from Honduras in two routes.

How did the government deal with this planned armed intervention? When Mr. Arbenz talked about the government's armed forces, he couldn't help but frown, sighed deeply with grief, and recalled:
"At that time, the Guatemalan armed forces had a total of 10,000 army and air force personnel, and only 20 aircraft, and they were old aircraft. They could only take off and fight for one day. After a long time, they had to be repaired. The Constitution stipulates that the army is not led by the president, but by the Congress. The leaders of the army are nominated by the army itself, and the government selects one of the three candidates to manage the army with full authority. The training, equipment and appointment of officers at all levels are all the responsibility of this person to issue orders. The army announced that it was not managed by the government. At the same time, there were American advisors in the army, and many officers were sent to the United States for training. The White House master knew the Guatemalan army like the back of his hand and knew everything."

However, the President of Guatemala, Arbenz, was neither able to understand the situation of his country's army nor had the right to intervene. What a strange army! What is even stranger is that some time ago, when I talked to another former president of Guatemala, Mr. Arevalo, about the situation of the army, he told me that there were actually four people controlling the Guatemalan army, and these four people were led by the American ambassador to Guatemala. They would do whatever the US embassy asked them to do. The US military attache in the US embassy in Guatemala directly commanded the bandit Amas to invade from Honduras.

It is conceivable how difficult it was for President Arbenz to command such a strange government army to resist the attack of the rebels supported by the United States. Amas's bandits entered Guatemala under the direction of their American masters. Arbenz informed the government army to prepare to resist and eliminate the rebels. The original agreed plan was to eliminate the rebels after they entered the country for fifteen kilometers. It was not difficult to eliminate 2,000 rebels with 10,000 army and air force personnel. The intention was to eliminate the rebels a little earlier, but because they were close to the border of Honduras, it was easy to cause misunderstandings and fear of engaging the Honduran army. Fifteen kilometers should be far enough, but the government army, under the instruction of the US embassy, ​​allowed the rebels to continue to penetrate deeper, ostensibly to facilitate the complete elimination, but actually to let the enemy in. Sure enough, when the rebels entered the main traffic road, the government's air force took off to fight, but instead of blocking and eliminating the rebels, they strafed everywhere, helping the rebels to attack. When the government army approached the rebels, instead of resisting and eliminating the rebels, they colluded with the rebels and, in fact, joined forces. The commander of the government army demanded that Arbenz resign, otherwise the government army would openly cooperate with the rebels.

Arbenz was looking for other ways. He wanted to buy weapons from foreign countries to arm the people who supported the democratic government to resist and eliminate the rebels. He talked about this, his eyebrows raised, and his eyes sparkled with hope. After a while, Mr. Arbenz continued:
"First, I bought from the United Kingdom. The money has already been paid, but the weapons were withheld by the British government. I bought from Germany, but Germany would not sell. Finally, I managed to buy weapons and they have been transported to Guatemalan ports, but American imperialism and the Guatemalan government army knew about it and insisted on handing these weapons over to the government army. The government was unarmed, and the entire army was under the control of the United States. They had no choice but to discuss with the government army and arm the people with weapons. The government army actually agreed, saying that it was to make preparations and stipulated that the people would be armed on Sunday."

Everything was ready, and the Sunday that thousands of Guatemalan people had been waiting for day and night finally arrived. But the government army, under the command of the US embassy, ​​suddenly announced that it did not recognize the government.

US Ambassador Preevifoy also tore off his mask and openly forced the Arbenz government to hand over power immediately in the form of an ultimatum, and to "cleanse" state organs. This conspiracy did not succeed, and he instigated the government army to launch a coup. On June 27, Arbenz was forced to announce his resignation and handed over power to the government army, which claimed to be non-political. In less than twenty-four hours, the commander of the army ordered his subordinates to overthrow him and replace him. On July 8, Amas, who was raised by American imperialism, ascended the throne as chairman of the dictatorial military government.

As soon as Amas came to power, he completely obeyed the instructions of the US embassy, ​​rolled up a bloody storm, returned the distributed land to the American United Fruit Company and landlords, and most of the members of the three-person committee established by the peasants during the land reform were hanged. Even Arbenz's private property was taken away by Amas.

The American imperialist conspiracy of armed intervention was successful, but it sowed the seeds of hatred on the land of Guatemala. The Guatemalan people have further recognized the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism and understand how to effectively smash it. This profound historical lesson will surely blossom new revolutionary flowers.

After this incident, Mr. and Mrs. Arbenz took their beloved children and went into exile abroad, and now reside in Uruguay. Arbenz talked about this past event, full of regret and hatred, and at the same time, full of hope for the future of Guatemala and Latin America.

Yes, the future belongs to the Guatemalan people. When I said goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Arbenz and walked out of Juan Beles Avenue, the vast Milky Way sky was covered with dark clouds, and the gale from the Atlantic Ocean was howling in the dark night, foreshadowing the coming storm!

周而复

    危地马拉的仇恨
    周而复
    在辽阔的像海洋一般的银河旁边，有一条清静的胡安·贝莱斯大街，两边是高耸入云的苍翠的树林，走进这条大街，仿佛进了森林。树林后面是一幢幢各种形式的洋房。靠右边，有一幢两层楼的洋房，进门是一大间餐厅和客厅连在一起。我走进去，主人热情地紧紧地握着我的手，非常亲切地说：
    “听说你们到乌拉圭来了，心里非常高兴。我们在这里会到了中国朋友。”
    从他亲切的谈吐和文雅的举止看，任何人绝想不到他是一位军人，一位上校，在1944年曾经领导了推翻当时的危地马拉独裁政府的斗争的危地马拉前总统阿本斯先生。1951年3月15日，他受到共产党、其他进步政党和各进步团体的一致支持，当选总统，建立了民族资产阶级的政权，实行资产阶级的民主改革。
    八年前，危地马拉的革命胜利，不仅一度揭开了这个长期被“绿色魔鬼”——美国联合果品公司所奴役的国家的新的史页，而且震撼着美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的统治。当时，全世界的人们关切地注视着危地马拉的局势，景仰着危地马拉人民的英雄气概。因而，当我看到阿本斯先生的时候，不由得从心底里涌起一种敬仰的亲切之感。
    尽管危地马拉的革命，被美国干涉者镇压下去了。但是，危地马拉人民的革命火焰，阿本斯政府在人民支持下反对美国干涉者的斗争的事迹，都是任何势力磨灭不了的。
    当年危地马拉人民在革命胜利后的朝气和活力，表现得多末蓬勃啊。阿本斯总统当选的票数差不多相等于他九个竞选对手票数总和的两倍。这在危地马拉选举历史上也是空前的，充分反映了人民的强烈的意志和希望。他就任总统之后，为了实现人民的愿望，国会通过了许多发展国民经济的决议，并制定了五年计划，这项计划的主要部分是土地改革。土地改革法规定：不论出租的形式怎么样，封建地主和外国公司所有出租的土地，凡面积在一百八十公顷以上，或有三分之一的面积没有耕种的大庄园，全分配给农业工人、无地和少地农民。农民成立了三人委员会，进行分配土地工作。分到土地的有五万五千七百人，得地五十三万公顷，其中十六万公顷是过去“绿色魔鬼”所霸占的。土地所有者被没收的土地，政府给予一定补偿，用发行“土地改革公债券”来付之。阿本斯总统本人也有许多土地，他首先交出来分配了。
    他的带有民族资产阶级色彩的进步政策和措施，受到全国人民的拥护，在拉丁美洲引起了巨大的影响。自然，也有一部分人极为仇恨，这就是以喝别人血汗为生的华尔街老板及其仆从们。侵略成性的白宫主人誓不甘休，于是拟订了颠复阿本斯民主政府的阴谋计划。
    我很想了解一下美帝国主义对付危地马拉的阴谋，这对于了解今天古巴的局势会有帮助的。可是阿本斯夫人请我到餐厅去吃晚饭了。她好像知道我的意图，微笑地说：“一边吃饭，一边谈。”
    她不仅是一位精明的主妇，而且是一位熟练的外交家。她曾经在美国留学，讲得一口极流畅的英语。今天晚上他们请我吃晚饭，是由她亲手安排的。我坐到餐桌面前，首先引起我注意的是每一个人面前都有一双筷子，这是她特为中国朋友预备的。我吃完丰富而又味美的冷盘，接着来的是一碗浓汤，那味道使我想起中国的牛肉汤。我对阿本斯夫人说：
    “这个汤的味道很好。”
    她脸上露出满意的微笑。
    我于是又和阿本斯先生谈到美帝国主义颠复危地马拉的阴谋。阿本斯就任总统之后，华尔街老板就开始进行颠复活动了。到1953年春天，他们看到危地马拉的人民在阿本斯总统领导下，走上了欣欣向荣的道路，美国在危地马拉的经济上的垄断势力和政治上的统治地位受到了震动。当时国务卿杜勒斯和国务院负责拉丁美洲事务的助理国务卿也就是美国联合果品公司股东和这个“绿色魔鬼”的对外关系的负责人布莱顿，忍不住公开叫嚣，要对危地马拉实行武装干涉。同年3月，美国政府正式出面了，阿本斯收到美国国务院的特别照会，公然声明那些已经分配给危地马拉人民的联合果品公司过去所霸占的土地，美国具有权利，要求赔偿。接着，美国把绞杀希腊人民革命运动的刽子手——美国驻希腊大使普里弗伊任驻危地马拉大使。新官上任三把火，这位“大使”当然加紧进行颠复活动，来显示刽子手的才能。美国还利用它所操纵的“美洲国家组织”进行干涉活动。1954年3月在委内瑞拉的加拉加斯举行的第十届泛美会议，通过了所谓“美洲国家保持政治上的团结一致，反对国际共产主义干涉宣言”，为干涉危地马拉制造了“合法”的根据。这个“宣言”通过以后，美国果然进一步加强了武装干涉的准备工作。首先，开动造谣与污蔑的机器，制造舆论，说什么“有大批苏联军火运抵危地马拉”，说什么“危地马拉政府煽动洪都拉斯的香蕉工人罢工”等等谎言；同时，强迫危地马拉的邻国洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜和美国订立“军事互助协定”，还要这两个国家和危地马拉断绝外交关系。另一方面，美帝国主义暗中在洪都拉斯装备和训练他的代理人阿马斯叛军，作为武装干涉的准备。
    危地马拉人民和阿本斯总统早已识破美帝国主义的侵略面目，警惕着白宫的颠复阴谋。在阿本斯总统就任的三年多的时间内，他领导危地马拉人民粉碎了白宫三十次的颠复活动。
    1954年6月18日，美国亲手训练的匪徒阿马斯上校率领了二千多名叛军，在美国空军的协助下，从洪都拉斯分两路侵入了危地马拉。
    政府怎样对付这一次有计划的武装干涉呢？阿本斯先生一谈到政府武装力量，不禁皱起眉头，不胜感伤地深深叹息了一声，回忆地说：
    “那时候，危地马拉的武装力量共有陆军和空军一万人，飞机只有二十架，而且是旧飞机，只能起飞一天作战，久了，就要修理。宪法规定军队不由总统统率，归国会领导。军队的领导人由军队自己提出三名候选人，再由政府选择其中一个人，全权管理军队。军队训练、装备和任命各级军官都是由这一个人负责发号施令。军队宣布不受政府管理，同时，军队里有美国顾问，许多军官被派到美国去受训。白宫主人对于危地马拉的军队了如指掌，什么事情都知道。”
    可是危地马拉的总统阿本斯，对于本国的军队既不能了解情况，也无权过问。这是一支多么奇怪的军队！更奇怪的是：前些时候，我和危地马拉另外一位前总统阿雷瓦洛先生谈到军队的情况，他告诉我控制危地马拉军队的实际上有四个人，这四个人受美国驻危地马拉大使所领导。美国大使馆要他们干什么，他们就干什么。直接指挥匪徒阿马斯从洪都拉斯侵入的便是美国驻危地马拉大使馆的武官。
    阿本斯总统指挥这样一支奇怪的政府军队去抵抗美国支持的叛军的进攻，他处境的困难是可想而知了。阿马斯匪徒在美国主子指使之下进了危地马拉。阿本斯通知政府军队准备抵抗并消灭叛军，原来商定计划是让叛军进入国境十五公里以后消灭掉。以一万陆军和空军来消灭二千叛军，这并不是一件什么困难的事。本想更早一点消灭叛军，因为靠近洪都拉斯边境，容易引起误会，怕和洪都拉斯的军队接上火。十五公里应该说已经很够远了，但政府军队在美国大使馆的授意下，让叛军继续深入，美其名曰便于全部消灭，实际上是引狼入室。果然，叛军进入交通要道时，政府的空军起飞作战了，但不是阻挡和消灭叛军，而是到处扫射，帮助叛军进攻。当政府军队和叛军接近的时候，也不是抵抗和消灭叛军，而是和叛军勾结，事实上会合在一道了。政府军指挥官要求阿本斯辞职，否则政府军队要和叛军公开合作了。
    阿本斯在寻找其他办法。他想从外国购买武器，武装拥护民主政府的人民，来抵抗和消灭叛军。他谈到这儿，眉头扬了起来，眼睛里闪耀着希望的光芒。停了一会，阿本斯先生继续说：
    “首先向英国买，款子已经付了，但是武器叫英国政府扣留了。向德国买，德国不卖。最后，好容易买到了武器，并且已经运到危地马拉港口，可是美帝国主义和危地马拉政府军队知道了，坚持要把这些武器交给政府军。政府手无寸铁，整个军队又在美国控制之下，只好和政府军商量，把武器武装人民。政府军居然答应了，说是要做准备工作，规定到星期日武装人民。”
    一切都准备就绪了，千千万万危地马拉人民日日夜夜盼望的星期日终于到了。但政府军队在美国大使馆指挥下，突然宣布：不承认政府。
    美国大使普里弗伊也撕下了假面具，公然用最后通牒的形式，迫使阿本斯政府马上交出政权，并且要“清洗”国家机关。这个阴谋没有成功，又策动政府军发动政变。6月27日，阿本斯被迫宣布辞职，把政权交给自称非政治的政府军队，不到二十四小时，军队的指挥官又叫部下推翻，取而代之。7月8日，美帝国主义豢养的阿马斯登上了独裁军政府主席的宝座。
    阿马斯一上台，完全俯首听命于美国大使馆指挥之下，卷起了血腥的风暴，把已经分配的土地交还给美国联合果品公司和地主，过去土地改革时农民成立的三人委员会的委员多数被绞死了。连阿本斯的私人财产也叫阿马斯抢走了。
    美帝国主义武装干涉的阴谋成功了，但在危地马拉的土地上播下了仇恨的种子。危地马拉人民更加认清了美帝国主义的侵略野心，懂得了应该怎样有效地粉碎它。这一深刻的历史教训一定会开出新的革命的花朵来。
    这次事变之后，阿本斯夫妇带着他们心爱的孩子流亡在国外，现在乌拉圭侨居下来。阿本斯谈起这段往事，充满了惋惜和仇恨，同时，对于危地马拉和拉丁美洲的未来满怀希望。
    是的，未来是属于危地马拉人民的。当我告别阿本斯夫妇，走出胡安·贝莱斯大街的时候，辽阔的银河上空布满乌云，从大西洋刮来的狂风在黑夜里呼啸着，在预告暴风雨就要到来！
