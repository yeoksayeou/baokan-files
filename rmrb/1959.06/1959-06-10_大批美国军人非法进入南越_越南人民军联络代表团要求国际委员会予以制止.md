In another sixteen cases, the International Commission had concluded its investigation but had not stated the results.

    越南人民军联络代表团要求国际委员会予以制止
    新华社河内9日电　据此间报纸报道：越南人民军总司令部联络代表团6月1日写信给越南国际委员会，抗议美国军事代表团从1956年1月以来大量地进入南越。
    信里说，从1956年1月到1959年4月13日，共有五十批美国军事人员、其中包括美国高级军事将领非法进入南越。
    人民军联络代表团在信里指出，这种行为严重违反了日内瓦协议。
    信里说，国际委员会过去已经就上述五十起违反日内瓦协议的事件中的九起事件作出了结论，确认南越当局违反了日内瓦会议关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定第十六条乙款；另外的十六起，国际委员会已经结束了调查工作但没有说明结果；其他二十五起，国际委员会还没有进行调查和作出结论。
    人民军联络代表团在信里要求越南国际委员会根据日内瓦协议的规定必须处理上述违反日内瓦协议的事件。
