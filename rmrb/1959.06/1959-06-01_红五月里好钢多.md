Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, May 30th. The Second Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company produced 1.7 times more high-quality steel in May than in April, setting an unprecedented record for quality. The plant's monthly production plan was completed ahead of schedule on the 29th; the steel's qualification rate reached 98.35%, an increase of 5.75% compared to April.

In May, Taiyuan Iron and Steel's high-quality, high-yield competition entered a climax. In the mass quality inspection movement, the Second Steelmaking Plant, through the extensive airing of views by workers and visits to fraternal factories, exposed some weaknesses in production that affected quality. Subsequently, it restored and improved rules and regulations to ensure quality, and implemented the factory Party committee's requirement of "high output on the basis of high quality, and fast smelting on the basis of maintenance." For example, the workers of the rolling mill pointed out that the steel ingots contained more non-metallic impurities, which affected the quality of the steel; the open-hearth furnace workers of the Second Steelmaking Plant, based on this opinion, restored the system that the smelting must have about half an hour of pure boiling time in the later stage, specifically to deal with non-metallic impurities. At the same time, they implemented operating procedures such as high-temperature mineral addition and second-by-second temperature measurement, which ensured the quality of the steel ingots and shortened the smelting time.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, May 30th. The ironmaking workshop of Shuicheng Iron and Steel Plant in Guizhou Province overfulfilled its May pig iron production plan by the 28th. The workshop's five small blast furnaces, with a total volume of 103 cubic meters, produced a total of 3,201 tons of pig iron. After testing, all of these pig iron were qualified, with first and second grade products accounting for more than 80%.

In May, the workshop continuously improved its production management. Based on their April experiences, the workers established a responsibility system, formulated systems for equipment maintenance and repair, and shift handover, and earnestly implemented them. At the same time, they launched a socialist labor competition of "comparing quality, comparing output, comparing innovation, comparing cost, comparing safety, and comparing collaboration." As a result, the production situation in this month has been good, with output increasing day by day. The average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reached 1.281 in the last ten days of the month; coke consumption and cost have been continuously decreasing, with an average of 0.93 tons of coke being used to smelt one ton of pig iron in the last ten days of the month.

    红五月里好钢多
    太钢第二炼钢厂
    新华社太原30日电　太原钢铁公司第二炼钢厂5月份出产的优质钢，比4月份增加一点七倍，创造了空前未有的优质新纪录。全月生产计划已提前在29日完成；钢的合格率达到98.35％，比4月份提高5.75％。
    5月份，太钢的优质高产竞赛进入了高潮。第二炼钢厂在群众性的质量检查运动中，通过职工大鸣大放和访问兄弟厂，揭露出生产中一些影响质量的弱点，接着，恢复和健全了保证质量的规章制度，贯彻工厂党委提出的“在优质的基础上高产，在维修的基础上快炼”的要求。如轧钢厂职工提出钢锭里含非金属杂质较多，影响钢材的质量；二钢厂平炉工人便根据这个意见，恢复冶炼后期必须有半小时左右的纯沸腾时间、专门处理非金属杂质的制度，同时实行高温加矿、看秒测温等操作规程，保证了钢锭质量，还缩短了冶炼时间。

    提前完成生铁计划
    新华社贵阳30日电　贵州省水城钢铁厂炼铁车间到28日超额完成了5月份的生铁生产计划。全车间五座容积共一百零三立方公尺的小高炉，共出产生铁三千二百零一吨。经过化验，这些生铁全部合格，一、二级品占80％以上。
    5月份，这个车间不断改进了生产管理。职工们根据4月份的经验，建立了责任制，订出了设备维护修理和交接班等制度，认真贯彻执行；同时开展了“比质量、比产量、比革新、比成本、比安全、比协作”的社会主义劳动竞赛。因此，这个月的生产情况一直良好，产量一天比一天高，高炉平均利用系数下旬达到一点二八一；焦炭消耗量和成本都不断下降，下旬平均每零点九三吨焦炭就炼一吨生铁。
