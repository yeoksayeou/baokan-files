Editorial Remarks:

    Wheat Harvest Not Yet Over
    The wheat harvest in various regions is nearing its end. However, judging from the reports of repeated harvesting and threshing in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other places, the wheat harvest is not yet over.
    In many places, the phenomena of incomplete threshing and scattering during the wheat harvest are quite serious, with losses reaching twenty to thirty jin per mu in some cases, and at least ten jin in others. This year, the country has planted over 300 million mu of wheat. If ten jin are scattered per mu, the country will lose over 3 billion jin; this amount is enough for 600 million people to eat for five days.
    In order not to let the grain already in hand be wasted in vain, it is necessary, like Sichuan and Shaanxi, to regard avoiding waste as an important task of the wheat harvest, and, with appropriate rewards, actively organize forces from all sides to earnestly launch a re-harvest and re-threshing campaign, so as to ensure that every grain returns home.

    麦收并未结束
    各地麦收已经接近尾声。但从四川、陕西等地复收复打的消息来看，麦收并未结束。
    很多地方麦收中脱粒不净和抛撒现象是十分严重的，多者每亩抛撒二、三十斤，少者也有十多斤。全国今年种植小麦三亿多亩，如果每亩抛撒十斤，全国就要损失三十多亿斤；这个数量足够六亿人口吃五天。
    为了不让已经到手的粮食白白丢掉，这就需要像四川、陕西那样，把避免浪费当作麦收的一项重要任务看待，以适当的奖励，积极组织各方面的力量，认真地发动一次复收复打，做到颗粒还家。
