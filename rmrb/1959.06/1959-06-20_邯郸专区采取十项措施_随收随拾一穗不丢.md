    Handan Prefecture Adopts Ten Measures
    Pick Up Every Grain, Leave Not a Single Ear Behind
    (Hebei Daily News) During the summer harvest, Handan Prefecture has adopted ten measures to ensure every grain is picked up and strive to leave not a single ear behind.
    At the start of the wheat harvest, the Handan Prefectural Committee called on cadres and farmers to cherish every grain and every ear of wheat, putting forward the slogan: "One grain of wheat is like one grain of gold, every grain is the heart of the commune member." More than 10,000 cadres from the prefecture, counties, and communes were assigned to specific communes and teams to conduct pilot projects in the fields, vigorously carrying out meticulous harvesting and gleaning, and adopted ten measures including "teaching, calculating, specialization, contracting, setting quotas, rewarding, linking, following, clearing, and inspecting." "Teaching" means explaining to commune members the importance of grain for building socialism, so that commune members establish the virtue of meticulous harvesting; "calculating" means calculating the comparative accounts of meticulous harvesting and rough harvesting; "specialization" means organizing the elderly and children into specialized wheat-picking teams to pick up wheat, with production teams as the unit; "contracting" means clarifying responsibilities and contracting at each level, with county committee members in each commune and full-time cadres in each team responsible for meticulous harvesting and threshing. Each production team is contracted by village cadres by area and group, and by Party members and League members by plot and row, combining meticulous harvesting and everyone's sense of responsibility; "setting quotas" and "rewarding" mean implementing methods of rewarding exceeding quotas on the basis of contracted quotas. For example, some teams stipulate that every thirty catties of wheat ears with stalks picked up will be recorded as one labor day, and the excess part will be given two cents of cash reward for every two catties, etc.; "linking" means that each process is closely linked, and wheat-cutting groups, wheat-bundling groups, wheat-transporting groups, and wheat-picking groups carry out competitions in a ring, supervising each other; "following" means seizing the time to pick up as the wheat is cut, to prevent the wheat ears from being lost in the field and germinating in the rain; "clearing" means achieving two clearings when the wheat is transported to the threshing ground, distinguishing between dry wheat and wet wheat in separate stacks, with each stack cleared to the bottom; "inspecting" means inspecting after picking.
    By June 15, of the 8,510,000 mu of wheat that had been cut down in the entire area, more than 70% of the wheat fields had been inspected and found to be clean, and more than 30 million catties of wheat had been picked up.

    邯郸专区采取十项措施
    随收随拾一穗不丢
    河北日报消息　邯郸专区在夏收当中，采取十项措施，做到随收随拾，力争做到颗穗不丢。
    这个专区收麦开始，邯郸地委就号召干部农民爱惜一颗、一穗小麦，提出：“一粒麦一粒金，粒粒都是社员心”的口号。专区、县、社一万多名干部分别包干社、队，深入田间搞试点，大力开展精收细拾，并采取了“教、算、专、包、定、奖、结、随、清、验”等十项措施。教，就是向社员讲解粮食对建设社会主义的重要性，使社员树立起精收光荣的风尚；算，就是算细收与粗收的对比账；专，就是以生产小队为单位，把老年、儿童组成拾麦专业队拾麦；包，就是明确责任逐级包干，社社有县委委员，队队有脱产干部负责精收细打，各个生产队由村干部包方包组、党员团员包地块包垅，把精收细拾和大家的责任感结合起来；定和奖，就是在包干定额的基础上，实行超额奖励的办法，例如有的队规定每拾三十斤带秆麦穗记一个劳动日，超额部分两斤给二分钱的现款报酬等；结，就是各个工序密切结合，割麦组、捆麦组、运麦组和拾麦组，连环开展竞赛，互相监督；随，就是抓紧时间随割随拾，防备丢掉地里的麦穗，遭雨生芽；清，就是麦运到场里实现两清，干麦和湿麦分清垛，垛垛清底；验，都是拾后验收。
    到6月15日全区割倒的八百五十一万亩小麦，经过验收，拾净的占麦田数的70％以上，拾回小麦三千多万斤。
