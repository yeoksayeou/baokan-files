Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, which has a long history of producing daily-use industrial products, has recently, under the leadership of the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, adjusted its industrial production layout appropriately in accordance with the policy of emphasizing both heavy and light industries. It has also mobilized technical forces and specialized equipment to actively restore and develop the production of daily-use industrial products. As of now, the number of factories in the city producing daily-use industrial products has increased from more than 100 at the beginning of the year to more than 220; the number of employees has also increased from about 10,000 to more than 15,000. The daily-use industrial products produced include nine major categories: metal products, daily-use general merchandise, cotton knitwear, stationery, daily-use cosmetics, leather shoes, wooden furniture, household groceries, and arts and crafts, totaling more than 4,000 specifications. Among them, famous-brand products and traditional products such as scissors, zippers, iron locks, fans, and grass mats, which are sold at home and abroad, were once reduced or suspended in production, but now they have been restored and have begun to be produced and shipped in batches.

The production of daily-use industrial products in Suzhou saw a significant increase in major products during the Great Leap Forward last year, and the quality also improved to varying degrees. However, with the substantial increase in social purchasing power, the demand for daily-use industrial products has become increasingly diverse. In addition, the economic reorganization last year resulted in the transfer of many handicraft cooperatives to other industries, which relatively reduced the variety of daily necessities. Some products were also reduced in production due to the lack of raw material supply, resulting in a contradiction between supply and demand. The Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the above situation and began to focus on the production of daily-use industrial products at the beginning of this year. In early April, it established a leading group for the production of daily-use industrial products and took practical measures to actively restore and develop traditional products, famous-brand products, and daily-use industrial products urgently needed by the masses, in order to meet the new needs of the market.

One of the important measures taken by the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is to first return a portion of the specialized technicians and specialized equipment that were dispersed during the economic reorganization last year to their positions in the production of daily-use industrial products after registration and screening. Then, within the daily-use industrial products sector, arrangements were made according to the principle of "urgent needs first, general needs second." For urgent needs, in addition to allocating manpower and equipment, a number of district-owned factories and private factories producing daily-use industrial products were added to increase output and variety. For example, in order to ensure a timely and sufficient supply of small hardware products, which are currently most urgently needed, the city transferred more than 1,000 workers from the machinery industry sector and allocated some equipment to establish the Yixin, Jinchang, and Changjiang Daily-Use Hardware Machinery Factories, forming a production network of small hardware products together with the small hardware factories distributed in various districts. As a result, many products have rapidly increased. In April and May, the city restored more than 500 varieties of small hardware products. Among them, the nationally renowned Zhang Xiaoquan scissors have now resumed production.

In the process of vigorously restoring and developing daily-use industrial products, the biggest problem encountered was the difficulty in supplying raw materials. Under the leadership of the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the city's industrial, commercial, and material supply departments explored potential from all aspects based on the characteristics of the materials used in the production of daily-use industrial products, and found abundant raw material resources. First, factories producing daily-use industrial products were organized to link up with large factories and construction departments to make full use of the offcuts, scraps, corner pieces, and broken materials from large factories and construction sites for production. After the Yixin Daily-Use Hardware Machinery Factory linked up with several machinery factories, its production raw materials for this year have been basically resolved. The various clothing buttons they produce were originally made of new iron sheets. Due to insufficient supply, production was intermittent, and the output in March was only 28,000 dozens. After linking up with the machinery factory in April, using scrap iron as raw material, 38,000 dozens were produced. In May, it exceeded 50,000 dozens.

Second, commercial departments were organized to actively cooperate closely with industrial departments, allocating manpower to go deep into various districts and street offices to investigate the factories' production capacity, product variety, market needs, and raw material supply, providing information to the industrial departments. At the same time, they provided convenience to the production departments in terms of raw material supply and product promotion. They adopted methods such as diligent searching, recycling waste products, refining recycled raw materials, and actively purchasing from other places to fully assist production units in breaking through the raw material barrier. From January to April, the 514 dan of waste rubber purchased by the city could be used to manufacture 25,700 pairs of rubber shoes, and the 11,855 dan of waste paper purchased could be used to produce 632 tons of writing paper. The city originally planned to produce 800 tons of soap this year. Due to the assistance of the commercial departments in solving raw materials such as caustic soda and hardened oil, 1,000 tons have been produced in five months. In addition, the factories themselves also manufactured a lot of raw materials.

Recently, the Municipal Party Committee also convened a meeting on the production of daily-use industrial products, deciding to continue to expand the variety of products; it also decided to strengthen product quality management and market price management, resolutely implement the policy of high quality and high price, and ensure that the people can get more affordable and high-quality daily necessities.

    苏州大力恢复传统百货生产
    本报南京8日电　日用工业品生产有悠久历史的江苏省苏州市，最近在中共苏州市委领导下，根据重工业和轻工业并举的方针，适当地调整了工业生产的布局，并调集了技术力量和专用设备，积极恢复和发展日用品工业的生产。到目前为止，全市生产日用工业品的工厂已由年初的一百多个，增加到二百二十多个；职工人数也由一万人左右增加到一万五千多人；生产的日用品中，包括金属制品、日用百货、棉针织品、文教用品、日用化妆品、皮鞋制品、木器家具、家用杂货和工艺美术等九大类，共有四千多种规格。其中行销国内外市场的剪刀、拉链、铁锁、扇子、草席等名牌产品和传统产品，曾一度减产或停产，现在都恢复起来，开始成批地生产出厂。
    苏州市日用工业品的生产，在去年大跃进中，主要产品都有很大的增加，质量也有不同程度的提高，但随着社会购买力的大大提高，对日用工业品的要求也越来越多样化；加上去年经济改组，许多手工业社转业，日用品的品种相对地减少了，有些则因原料得不到供应而减产了，结果供应与需要之间就发生了矛盾。中共苏州市委分析了上述情况，在今年年初就开始抓日用工业品的生产；4月初又成立了日用工业品生产领导小组，并采取切实的措施，积极恢复和发展传统产品、名牌产品和群众急需的日用工业品，以满足市场新的需要。
    中共苏州市委采取的重要措施之一是：首先将去年经济改组中分散的一部分专业技术工人和专用设备，经过登记排队以后，让他们回到日用工业品生产的岗位上来；接着在日用品工业部门内部，也按照
  “先急需后一般”的原则作了安排，对于急需的，除了调拨人力和设备外，还添设了一批生产日用品工业的区属工厂和民办工厂，增加了产量和品种。譬如为了保证当前最急需的小五金产品及时得到充足的供应，全市从机械工业部门调出一千多工人，拨出一部分设备，建立了益新、金阊、长江等三个日用五金机械厂，同分布在各区的小五金工厂，组成了一个小五金产品生产网。这样，许多产品迅速增加起来，4、5两个月全市小五金产品已恢复五百多种。其中闻名全国的张小泉剪刀现在也恢复生产了。
    在大力恢复和发展日用工业品的过程中，遇到的最大问题是原材料的供应困难。在中共苏州市委的领导下，全市工业、商业、物资供应部门根据日用工业品生产用料的特点，从各方面挖掘潜力，找到了丰富的原料资源。首先，组织生产日用工业品的工厂与大厂、建筑部门挂钩，充分利用大厂和建筑工地的下脚、边料、角料、碎料进行生产。益新日用五金机械厂与几个机械工厂挂钩以后，今年的生产原料已基本得到解决。他们生产的各种衣扣原来用新铁皮生产，由于供应不足，生产时断时续，3月份产量只有两万八千打；4月份与机械工厂挂钩后，用旧铁皮作原料，生产三万八千打，5月份已超过五万打。
    其次，组织商业部门主动与工业部门密切协作，配备力量深入各区、街道办事处，调查工厂生产能力、生产品种、市场需要和原料供应的情况，向工业部门提供资料；同时又从原料供应与产品推销等各方面给予生产部门方便。他们采取勤跑勤找、回收废品、提炼再生原料、积极向外地采购等办法，全力协助生产单位突破原料关。从1月到4月，全市收购的五百十四担废橡胶，就可制造胶鞋二万五千七百双，收购的一万一千八百五十五担废纸，可生产白报纸六百三十二吨。全市今年原计划生产肥皂八百吨，由于商业部门协助解决了烧碱、硬化油等原料，五个月已生产了一千吨。此外，各厂自己也制造了不少原料。
    最近，市委又召开了日用品工业生产会议，决定继续扩大产品的花色品种；还决定加强产品质量管理和市场价格管理，坚决贯彻优质优价政策，保证人民能得到更多的价廉物美的日用品。（附图片）
