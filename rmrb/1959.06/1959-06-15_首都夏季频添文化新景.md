Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Since the beginning of summer, the cultural life of the people in Beijing has become increasingly rich and colorful. Relevant departments are taking further measures to adapt to the people's growing cultural needs.

The colorful May Art and Literature Performance has just ended, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Art and Literature Performance has brought precious art "gifts" to Beijing audiences. In the past month or two, six or seven local theater troupes have come to Beijing to perform Yue Opera, Xi Opera, Hui Opera, Yiyang Opera, and the Jing Opera of the Yan (Jupeng) school, which has been silent for many years. Movie theaters screened sixteen or seventeen new films in May, an increase compared to the first quarter. Currently, many new plays and films will be released and screened one after another, and audiences can choose their favorite programs according to their different artistic preferences.

The city's cultural palaces, parks, libraries, and cultural centers have also launched a variety of activities. As the sun sets, tourists flock to the parks, where workers watch operas, listen to music, drink tea, play chess, and enjoy the cool air, recharging their batteries for the next day's work. In many stadiums in the city, off-duty workers show off their skills, and first-class basketball and volleyball players give wonderful performances to fans. Swimming enthusiasts have also begun their "water life" this year.

Many cinemas and theaters in Beijing are trying their best to facilitate the audience. Many cinemas, such as Dahua, have added a number of "satellite" screening points in the city. Many cinemas screen early shows or children's shows according to the needs of the audience, and organize mobile screening teams to send movies to factories and schools in the suburbs. Some small theaters and teahouses that perform folk art have adopted a time-based charging method, so the viewing time can be long or short, and the ticket price can be high or low, which is very popular among the audience. The Beijing People's Art Theater, the China Youth Art Theater, and other famous art performance units also send plays to audiences far from the theater, so that they can see the world-famous comedy "The Miser" and the newly staged drama "The Last Scene" without having to walk a long way. Xun Huisheng, Xiao Bai Yushuang and other famous Jing and Ping opera actors also perform their best plays in the working-class areas of the suburbs. Mei Lanfang specially performed his newly arranged "Mu Guiying Takes Command" at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall and the open-air theater of the Working People's Cultural Palace, so as to enable more audiences to see his artistic style.

The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and relevant departments recently held a special meeting to formulate measures to further carry out cultural activities. The meeting determined that it is necessary to further improve the quality of performances, ensure the health of actors, and strive to meet the people's growing cultural needs, and adopt various methods to facilitate the audience. The meeting required art units and cinemas to vigorously select and perform new and good programs. The Beijing Municipal Film Distribution Department decided to release about 20 new films in June and July, an increase of nearly one-third compared to May, and each cinema also plans to select some excellent films for re-screening. Theaters and troupes will further strengthen city and suburban tours and medium- and small-scale performances to bring plays to the door to expand the audience. Literary and art units and film screening units will also cooperate with parks to organize more open-air performances and garden parties. Beijing's libraries, museums, and some bookstores will also provide services for audiences and readers through mobile exhibitions, book delivery to homes, and setting up morning stalls.
