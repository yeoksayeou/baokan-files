    Shanghai Daily Necessities Factories Launch "Make the Most of Everything" Campaign
    Expand Raw Material Sources Increase Utilization Value
    Tianjin Widely Recovers and Utilizes Waste Products to Support Daily Necessities Production

    (Report from this newspaper) Shanghai's many industrial sectors that produce daily necessities are doing everything possible to make full use of materials, and this has developed into a mass movement. Many factories, from the five aspects of comprehensive utilization, rational use, economical substitution, recycling, and waste utilization, have greatly expanded the resources of raw materials, tapped huge potential, and increased the production of many daily necessities. After launching the "Five Uses" campaign in the first five months of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Chemical Industry increased production by 58% compared to the same period last year, with only a slight increase in raw materials compared to last year.

    According to the different characteristics of various industries, Shanghai's daily necessities industry has adopted various methods to make full use of raw materials. One of the most common methods is comprehensive utilization. For example, Shanghai Timber Factory No. 1, No. 2, and Yangzi Timber Factory have used scrap wood and wood shavings to make various kinds of particleboard. Some of these wood boards can be used to make furniture, and some can be used as building materials. Jiangning Sawmill Board Box Factory uses simple local methods to distill a high-grade fragrance oil from cedar wood chips, worth nearly 10,000 yuan per ton. After the used wood chips are dry-distilled, they are made into chemical raw materials such as vinegar stone, sodium acetate, phenolic oil, light oil, asphalt, and activated carbon. These raw materials have important uses in plastics, pharmaceuticals, and paint manufacturing.

    Since the beginning of this year, relevant departments in Shanghai have strengthened the organizational leadership of making full use of materials. The Rubber Industry Company and the Paper Industry Company have organized joint recycling agencies with waste product companies to carry out the recycling of waste rubber and waste paper in the city's neighborhoods. In the first five months of this year, after the city recycled waste rubber and made it into reclaimed rubber, it can be used to prepare nearly 10 million pairs of rubber shoes. Some industrial bureaus have established allocation groups for corner materials and leftover materials to carry out unified scheduling between factories, striving to achieve full and rational use. The Chemical Industry Bureau organized relevant factories to cooperate with each other to comprehensively utilize raw materials such as boron-magnesium ore and lead-zinc ore. When selling sugar cane and hairtail, hundreds of fruit stores and vegetable markets in the city also painstakingly scrape off sugar cane peels and hairtail scales for factories to use for papermaking and making celluloid glitter powder.

    In order to make the most of everything, factories have mobilized the masses to use a combination of indigenous and modern methods to manufacture their own production equipment, which costs little but has great results. Xu Hui Sawmill used wood chips to manufacture activated carbon. Originally, a set of machines such as motorized water pumps and filter presses was needed. The workers used simple equipment such as water tanks and bamboo baskets and spent only 2,000 yuan to build a workshop with an annual output of 150 tons of activated carbon, with an annual output value of more than 700,000 yuan.

    Many factories have not only expanded the source of raw materials but also significantly improved their production technology level due to the implementation of the "Five Uses" method. The Shanghai Soap Factory, which could only use grease to manufacture soap in the past, now uses a large amount of shredded cowhide to produce "Remibang," an advanced synthetic detergent that used to be imported.

    Now, the movement of making the most of everything in Shanghai's daily necessities factories is gradually deepening, and the source of raw materials is constantly expanding.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th -- Tianjin is widely recovering and utilizing waste products to support industrial production.

    Tianjin established a waste product purchasing office at the beginning of this year, and each district has also established agencies for collecting and sorting waste products. In addition to the original 65 state-owned waste product collection stations in the city, 75 "waste product collection stations" were also established relying on street residents, with people from the waste product company providing technical guidance. Each collection station has many collection carts that travel through the streets and alleys every day, collecting and publicizing the collection and sale of waste products to residents. To facilitate residents' sales, the collection stations also implemented methods such as door-to-door collection, appointment telephone calls, and evening collection. As of June 10, the city had collected more than 89,000 tons of waste products such as waste steel, mixed copper, waste paper, and rags, worth more than 50 million yuan. The waste paper, rags, and old cloth shoes and other papermaking raw materials supplied to the city's eight paper mills alone accounted for about 70% of the materials used by these paper mills.

    The Tianjin Waste Products Company organizes more than a dozen waste product processing plants. Some waste products are processed into raw materials for the paper, textile, and rubber industries, and some are made into small commodities for the market. In the past few months, they have used rags to produce more than 8,000 mops, more than 15,000 pairs of rubber shoe soles, and many small knives, toys, etc. The processing plant of the Nankai District Waste Products Company used the purchased broken tables, chairs, and beds to dismantle and repair various good furniture, and also selected a large number of radio parts from the waste pile to assemble more than 700 radios.

### 上海日用品工厂开展“物尽其用”运动  扩大原料来源  提高利用价值  天津广泛回收利用废品支援日用品生产

    上海日用品工厂开展“物尽其用”运动
    扩大原料来源  提高利用价值
    天津广泛回收利用废品支援日用品生产
    本报讯　上海市许多生产日用品的工业部门千方百计地充分利用物资，并且发展成为一个群众性的运动。许多工厂从综合利用、合理使用、节约代用、回收重用、废物利用等五个方面，大大扩大了原材料的资源，挖掘出巨大的潜力，增产了许多生活用品。上海市化学工业局今年头五个月内，发动群众开展“五用”以后，在原料比去年增加不多的情况下，生产比去年同期提高了58％。
    上海日用品工业根据各行各业不同的特点，对原材料的充分利用采取了各种不同的方法。其中最普遍的一种方法是综合利用。例如上海木材一厂、二厂、杨子木材厂等，利用零碎木材和刨花制成了各种各样的刨花板。这些木板有的可以用来做家具，有的可以当作建筑材料。江宁锯木板箱厂用简单的土办法从杉木屑中蒸馏出一种高级的香料油，每吨价值近一万元。用过的木屑再经过干馏，又制成了醋石、醋酸钠、酚油、轻油、沥青、活性炭等化工原料。这些原料在塑料、制药、造漆等方面都有着重要用途。
    上海市各有关部门，今年以来加强了充分利用物资的组织领导工作。橡胶工业公司、造纸工业公司都和废品公司组织了联合的回收机构，在全市里弄中开展了废胶、废纸的回收工作。今年头五个月，全市回收废胶制成再生胶以后，可以用来配制近一千万双胶鞋。有的工业局成立了角料余料的分配小组，在各厂之间进行统一调度，力求做到充分合理的使用。化学工业局组织有关工厂互相协作，对硼镁矿、铅锌矿等原料进行综合利用。全市几百个水果店、小菜场在出售甘蔗、带鱼的时候，也不厌其烦地把甘蔗皮、带鱼鳞刮下来给工厂拿去造纸和做赛璐珞的闪光粉。
    为了做到物尽其用，各厂都发动群众用土洋结合的办法自己制造生产设备，花钱不多，效果很大。徐汇锯木厂利用木屑制造活性炭，本来需要机动水泵、压滤机等一套机器，工人们采用水缸、竹箩等简单设备，只花了二千元就建成了一座年产一百五十吨活性炭的车间，每年的产值可达七十多万元。
    许多工厂由于推行了“五用”办法，不仅扩大了原料的来源，生产技术水平也有了显著的提高。过去只能用油脂制造肥皂的上海制皂厂，现在利用碎牛皮大量生产一向需要进口的高级合成洗涤剂“雷米邦”。
    现在，上海日用品工厂的物尽其用的运动正在逐步深入，原材料的来源正在不断扩大。
    新华社天津27日电　天津市广泛回收利用废品，支援工业生产。
    天津市在今年初就设立了废品收购办公室，各区也都成立了收拣废品的机构。全市除了原有的六十五个国营废品收购站以外，还依靠街道居民办了七十五个“废品收购站”，由废品公司派人进行技术指导。各收购站有许多收购小车，每天游街串巷，边收购边向居民宣传收集和出售废品。为了便利居民出售，收购站还实行了登门收购、预约电话、晚间收购等办法。到6月10日，全市已经收购废钢铁、杂铜、废纸、破布等废品共八万九千多吨，价值五千多万元。仅供应全市八个造纸厂的废纸、破布、旧布鞋等造纸原料就占这些纸厂用料的70％左右。
    天津市废品公司组织有十几个废品加工厂。一部分废品经过加工成为造纸、纺织、橡胶行业的原料，一部分制成了小商品供应市场。几个月来，他们利用破布生产了八千多个墩布、一万五千多双胶鞋底以及许多小刀、玩具等。南开区废品公司的加工厂，用收购来的破桌椅、床铺拆改拼修成各种好家具，还从废品堆里挑选出大批收音机零件，装成七百多架收音机。
