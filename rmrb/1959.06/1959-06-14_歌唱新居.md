Post-Editing Notes

    Singing of New Homes
    In the past, there was nowhere to drive a stake on the shore,
    Now roots are growing on the land,
    The old, weak, and disabled have a place to go,
    Young people and children have a home to return to.
        Boat people of Jianhu

    歌唱新居
    过去岸上无扎锥，
    现在陆上生了根，
    老弱残疾有出处，
    青年儿童有家归。
        建湖船民
