Leading by Example and Diligently Studying
Beijing Institute of Technology Student Cadres Properly Arrange Study Time

(Our report) The Party Committee of Beijing Institute of Technology launched a campaign for Party, Youth League, and Student Union cadres to take the lead in studying diligently and better master scientific knowledge, which promoted the rapid formation of a school-wide atmosphere of conscientious study and assiduous research.

Around the start of this semester, the leaders of Beijing Institute of Technology had already comprehensively arranged teaching, scientific research, and production labor, based on the principle of putting teaching first. In order to understand how this principle was being implemented among students and student cadres, in early May, the person in charge of the college's Party committee went to the grassroots student organizations in various departments to conduct investigation and research. They found that student cadres generally had commendable political enthusiasm, and their thoughts and actions had a significant impact on the entire student body. However, many student cadres did not have a comprehensive understanding of "red" and "expert," and did not properly handle the relationship between study and social work. Many classes arranged more extracurricular activities, and these activities were often concentrated on a few key cadres, squeezing out these students' study time.

Subsequently, the Party and Youth League organizations of the school analyzed the subjective and objective reasons for the above situation, and carried out meticulous positive ideological education through Party classes, Youth League classes, and Youth League forums, enabling all student cadres and the broad masses of students to have a clear understanding. They understood that "red" and "expert" are unified. Being both "red" and "expert" is a unified requirement that the entire era puts forward to the younger generation. Studying is an important task for young students. Only by studying hard and delving into research for the lofty ideals of the Party's noble cause can we better serve socialist construction. Therefore, while continuously improving political awareness, we must strictly demand ourselves in study. After the understanding was improved, the Party committee called on all cadres among the students, including Party members and non-Party activists, to do a good job in their studies with a high degree of political consciousness, tenacious will, and perseverance, not only taking the lead in politics, but also taking the lead in conscientious study and assiduous research. This call received a warm response from the students.

At the same time, the Party and Youth League organizations of Beijing Institute of Technology also earnestly studied the question of how student cadres should carry out their work, and specifically helped them deal with the contradictions between work and study. The person in charge of the Party committee gave a report to all student Party group leaders and Party member cadres above the level of Youth League branch secretary on the topic of "How Should the Party's Grassroots Work in Schools Be Carried Out," emphasizing that the entire class work, while helping students improve their awareness and transform their thinking, must ensure that they do a good job in their studies. Student cadres should be good at leveraging the collective strength of the masses to do their work well and improve work quality and efficiency. Some work that should not be borne by students, such as the film team work, was transferred from the Student Union to the administrative and trade union departments. After investigation and research and unified arrangements, some unnecessary activities were streamlined to ensure that students and student cadres had sufficient time to study their courses.

As a result, the students' enthusiasm for studying and the initiative greatly improved. They comprehensively arranged their work and study, and generally managed to devote at least fifty-four hours per week to attending classes and self-study. In the past, many cadres could only review their notes when reviewing their lessons, but now they can also review lecture notes and textbooks, and many people can also read certain reference books. Some cadres, in order to strictly demand themselves, have also formulated personal research plans. Those whose studies were previously affected more demanded to catch up; those who had a good foundation in the past also demanded to further improve. Some student cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds who were previously exempted from studying foreign languages due to their poor learning foundation have now also taken the initiative to start learning Russian.

### 以身作则　认真读书  北京工业学院学生干部妥善安排学习时间

    以身作则　认真读书
    北京工业学院学生干部妥善安排学习时间
    本报讯　北京工业学院党委发动党、团、学生会干部带头勤奋读书，更好地掌握科学知识，推动了全校认真学习、刻苦钻研风气的迅速形成。
    这学期开学前后，北京工业学院领导已根据教学为主的原则全面安排了教学、科学研究和生产劳动。为了了解这个原则在学生和学生干部中贯彻执行的情况，5月初，这个学院的党委负责人分头深入各系学生基层组织进行了调查研究，发现学生干部一般都有着可贵的政治热情，他们的思想和行动对全校学生有很大的影响。但是有不少学生干部对红与专的认识不够全面，对学习和社会工作处理得不够妥善。许多班级学习以外的工作活动安排得多了些，而这些活动往往集中在少数主要干部身上，挤掉了这些学生的学习时间。
    接着，这个学校的党、团组织分析了形成以上情况的主观和客观原因，采用党课、团课、共青团论坛等方式，细致地开展了正面的思想教育，使全校学生干部和广大学生有了明确的认识。他们懂得了红与专是统一的。又红又专是整个时代向青年一代提出的统一的要求。学习是青年学生的重要任务。只有为党的崇高事业的远大理想，努力学习，刻苦钻研，才能更好地为社会主义建设服务。因此在不断提高政治觉悟的同时，必须在学习上严格地要求自己。认识提高以后，党委号召学生中所有的干部包括党员和非党积极分子，以高度的政治自觉、顽强的意志和毅力搞好学习，不仅在政治上要带头，而且在认真读书、刻苦钻研上也要带头。这一号召得到了学生热烈的响应。
    与此同时，北京工业学院党、团组织还切实研究了学生干部应该如何进行工作的问题，具体帮助他们处理工作和学习的矛盾。党委负责人以“学校中党的基层工作应如何进行”为题，向全校学生党小组长、团支部书记以上的党员干部做了报告，着重指出整个班级工作在帮助学生提高觉悟、改造思想的同时。必须保证搞好学习，学生干部要善于发挥群众的集体力量来做好工作，提高工作质量和效率。将一些不应由学生担负的工作如电影队工作，由学生会移交行政、工会部门。经过调查研究和统一安排，精简了一些不必要的活动，保证学生和学生干部都有充分的时间学习功课。
    这样一来，学生干部们学习的自觉性积极性大大提高，他们全面安排了自己的工作和学习，一般都已做到每周至少有五十四小时用于上课和自修。过去许多干部复习功课时只能把笔记复习一下，现在还能复习讲义和教科书，有不少人还能阅读一定的参考书。有些干部为了严格要求自己，还订出了个人钻研计划。原来学习受影响较多的，要求努力跟上去；原来学习基础较好的，也要求进一步提高。过去因学习基础不好免修外国语的一些工农出身的学生干部，现在也主动开始学俄文了。
