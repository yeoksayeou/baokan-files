Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 15th: Hungary has achieved great success in the construction industry over the past decade. The number of residential, production, and public buildings constructed in the last ten years exceeds the number built in the half-century before liberation.

This was stated by Apro, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and First Deputy Prime Minister of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, at a conference in Budapest on June 13th celebrating the tenth anniversary of the nationalization of the Hungarian construction industry.

Apro pointed out that in the past decade, brand new industrial cities such as Stalin City and a series of large-scale enterprises such as the Diósgyőr Metallurgical Works, the Szeged Textile Factory, and the large power stations in Borsod and Ajka have emerged on Hungarian soil. In addition, nearly 270,000 housing units have been built in the past ten years.

Apro said that the lives of construction workers have also greatly improved over the past decade. More than 50,000 construction workers nationwide now live in modern housing, and construction workers' wages and benefits have increased by 177% compared to 1949.

Apro pointed out that this year's construction tasks have increased by 16.6% compared to last year, including the construction of power stations, the hot rolling workshop of the Danube Iron and Steel Works, and the steelmaking workshop of the Ozd Iron and Steel Works, as well as approximately 15,000 housing units and 200 classrooms.

To ensure the successful completion of construction tasks, the government has increased investment by 250 million forints this year beyond the planned amount to improve construction machinery and equipment. In the future, the government will also strengthen research in construction technology, improve labor methods, and train more construction technicians to meet the needs of the development of construction work.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 13th: Residents throughout Hungary are actively participating in voluntary labor to carry out various public facility construction projects.

Residents in various districts of Budapest have launched a campaign to beautify the capital through voluntary labor. They actively participate in planting flowers and trees, repairing roads, building underground sewers, and helping to build primary school classrooms, kindergartens, and nurseries. Residents of the Ninth District of Budapest are building a Young Pioneer Palace for children. Residents voluntarily donate construction funds and actively participate in construction work during their spare time. Women use their rest time to make various interior decorations for the Young Pioneer Palace.

Workers and young people in cities across the country also voluntarily use their holidays to go to rural areas to help newly established agricultural production cooperatives build cowsheds, stables, and warehouses.

Young people have shown particularly high enthusiasm for participating in voluntary labor. A group of Communist Youth League members are participating in the construction of the Borsodnádasd coal mining area through voluntary labor. Communist Youth League members who are building the Borsod Chemical Combine have already completed various preparations for assembling machinery through voluntary labor. Communist Youth League members in the Ostra Industrial Zone are building a large summer camp. In Szolnok County, more than 3,000 young people have helped agricultural production cooperatives for more than 35,000 hours. Young people in Veszprém County have planted nearly one million trees through voluntary labor. During this summer vacation, more than 10,000 college and middle school students will go to the Hanság Marsh and other places to participate in voluntary labor. (Attached picture)

    十年超过五十年
    匈建筑工业有长足进展
    各地人民积极义务参加公共建筑工作
    新华社布达佩斯15日电　最近十年来匈牙利在建筑工业方面获得了很大的成绩。十年内所建造的住宅、生产建筑物和公用建筑物比解放前半世纪中所建造的还要多。
    这是匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、工农革命政府第一副总理奥普罗13日在布达佩斯庆祝匈牙利建筑工业国有化十周年的大会上所说的。
    奥普罗指出，十年来在匈牙利的国土上出现了崭新的工业城市——斯大林城和一系列的大型企业如迪奥日吉厄尔冶金联合厂、塞盖德纺织工厂等，以及包尔绍德和阿以卡大型发电站。此外，过去十年内还建筑了近二十七万套住宅。
    奥普罗说，十年来建筑工人的生活也有了很大的改善。现在全国有五万多建筑工作者住在具有现代化设备的住宅中，建筑工人的工资等比1949年提高了177％。
    奥普罗指出，今年建筑工业的任务比去年又提高了16.6％，包括建设一些发电站、多瑙钢铁厂的热轧车间和奥兹德钢铁厂的炼钢车间等工程，以及约一万五千套住宅和二百个教室。
    为保证建筑任务的胜利完成，政府今年又超计划增加了两亿五千万福林投资，来改善建筑机器设备。今后政府还将加强建筑技术的研究工作，改进劳动方法，培养更多的建筑技术人材，以适应建筑工作发展的需要。
    新华社布达佩斯13日电　匈牙利各地居民纷纷参加义务劳动，进行各种公共设施的建设工作。
    布达佩斯各区居民发起了以义务劳动来美化首都的运动。他们积极参加了种花、种树、修路、修建地下水道，帮助建筑小学教室、幼儿园和托儿所等工作。布达佩斯第九区的居民正在为孩子们建筑一座少先宫。居民们自动捐献建筑经费，并且在业余休息时间积极参加建筑工作。妇女们则利用休息时间为少先宫赶做各种内部装饰品。
    全国各城市的工人和青年还自动利用假日到农村帮助新成立的农业生产合作社盖牛舍、马厩和仓库等。
    青年们对参加义务劳动表现了特别高的热情。一批共青团员正在用义务劳动参加包尔绍德纳达日德煤区的建设。正在建筑包尔绍德化学联合企业的共青团员，已经用义务劳动做好了装配机器的各种准备工作。俄斯特工业区的共青团员正在建筑一个大的夏令营。索尔诺克州已有三千多名青年帮助农业生产合作社劳动了三万五千多小时。维斯普雷姆州的青年用义务劳动培植了近百万株树。在今年暑假期间，还将有一万多名大、中学生到汉沙格沼泽地和其他地方去参加义务劳动。（附图片）
