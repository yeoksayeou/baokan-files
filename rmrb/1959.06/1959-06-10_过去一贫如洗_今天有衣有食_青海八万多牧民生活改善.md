Xinhua News Agency, Xining – Over 80,000 impoverished herdsmen in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province have seen rapid development in production and improved living standards with the help of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

Before liberation and in the early post-liberation period, these herdsmen were destitute. Under the cruel oppression of the reactionary rule before liberation, they suffered from hunger, cold, and rampant diseases, burdened with debt. Some even lived in the wilderness, surviving by hunting, digging fern roots, or wandering around begging.

With the liberation of Qinghai, these poor herdsmen were reborn, receiving care and attention from the Party and the government. Over the past eight years, the civil affairs departments of Qinghai Province have distributed over four million yuan in relief funds and loans to these impoverished herdsmen, helping them solve their difficulties with food, winter clothing, livestock, and production tools. According to recent surveys, among the more than 80,000 impoverished herdsmen in the pastoral areas of the province, 40,000 have basically achieved self-sufficiency in production, and the living problems of the remaining 40,000 have also been resolved. Especially after nearly one or two years of relief and assistance, in most Tibetan areas such as Hainan, Haibei, Haixi, and Huangnan, the extremely poor households who owned nothing have disappeared.

The development of production has brought about significant changes in the lives of most impoverished herdsmen. In the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, thanks to the vigorous organization of production and the distribution of large amounts of relief loans by the Party and the government, the average income of impoverished herdsmen is now generally around 30 to 50 yuan per year. For example, the herdsman Moluo's family has three laborers, and their income is now so high that they can not only eat milk, ghee, and meat, but also white flour. (Attached picture)

### 过去一贫如洗  今天有衣有食  青海八万多牧民生活改善

    过去一贫如洗  今天有衣有食
    青海八万多牧民生活改善
    新华社西宁讯　青海省牧业区八万多贫苦牧民在共产党和人民政府帮助下，生产迅速发展，生活得到了改善。
    解放前和解放初期，这些牧民一贫如洗。在解放前反动统治的残酷压榨下，饥寒交迫，疫病流行，负债累累，有些人甚至露宿在荒郊野外，以打猎、挖蕨麻为生，或者到处讨乞流浪。
    随着青海的解放，这些贫苦的牧民获得了新生，受到党和政府的关怀与照顾。在八年当中，青海省民政部门给这些贫苦牧民发放了四百多万元的救济款和贷款，帮助他们解决口粮、冬衣、牲畜和生产工具的困难。据最近调查，全省牧业区的八万多贫苦牧民中，已有四万人基本上达到了生产自给，其余四万人的生活问题也得到了解决。特别是经过了近一、二年的救济和扶助，在海南、海北、海西、黄南等大部分藏族地区，一无所有的赤贫户已经绝迹。
    生产的发展，使多数贫苦牧民的生活起了显著变化。果洛藏族自治州的贫苦牧民们，由于党和政府大力组织生产，发放大量救济贷款，现在一般每人每年收入三十到五十元左右。如牧民莫洛一户共有三个劳动力，现在收入很多，不仅能吃到牛奶、酥油、肉食，还能吃到白面。（附图片）
