    Pest Scouts: Day and Night in the Fields
    At night, in the fields of the Tagang Production Team of the Pukou Commune in Liling County, Hunan, a bright oil lamp shines. All kinds of insects fly in waves. Fortunately, the activities of these insects damaging the seedlings are all seen through by Gan Liwen, the pest scout who stays by their side every night.
    Pest scout Gan Liwen is tirelessly active, whether it is the dim early morning or the pitch-black night, going to every field to check and observe the changes in pest conditions. He reports the situation to the brigade's pest control team every other day. On May 18th, while scouting in Sifangzhou, he discovered that a rice seedling had been damaged by stem borers, and there were also six kinds of pests such as rust leafhoppers and rice moths, fiercely harming the tender green seedlings. He hurriedly reported to the pest control team, and immediately dispatched twenty-eight commune members to spray pesticide, pull out diseased seedlings, and beat bamboo strips in the rice fields of this continent, catching and exterminating the pests on a large scale. The pest damage was eliminated in time.

    虫情侦察员　日夜在田间
    夜间，湖南醴陵县普口公社它刚生产队的田垅里，一盏明亮的油灯，闪着光辉。各色各样的虫儿阵阵飞来。正好，这些虫儿破坏禾苗的活动，全被每夜守在旁边的虫情侦察员甘礼文一一看穿了。
    虫情侦察员甘礼文不管是曚曚的清早和漆黑的夜晚，一股劲地活动，到每块田边去检查、观察虫情的变化。每隔一天就向大队虫情组报告情况。5月18日那天，他在四方洲侦察，发现一蔸禾苗被钻心虫吃伤，还有锈叶虫、螟虫等六种虫害，正在凶恶地危害着嫩绿的禾苗。他急忙报告了虫情组，随即出动了二十八个社员，在这洲上的禾田里，喷药水、拔病苗、打竹条，大捕大灭，虫害及时被消灭了。
