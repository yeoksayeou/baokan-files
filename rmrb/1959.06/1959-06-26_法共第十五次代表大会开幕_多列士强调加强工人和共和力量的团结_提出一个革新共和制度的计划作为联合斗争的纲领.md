Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 24th -- The 15th Congress of the French Communist Party (PCF) opened this morning at the sports stadium in Ivry, near Paris.

The Congress will discuss the following agenda: 1. Unite workers and republican forces to strive for the restoration and reform of democracy (Reporter: Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party); 2. Elect the party's leadership.

This congress will summarize the activities of the French Communist Party since the 14th Congress and plan for future work. Since April of this year, members of the French Communist Party have carefully studied the Central Committee's document summarizing the party's policies—the draft program for the 15th Congress. They listened to the opinions of workers on the draft program and conducted extensive democratic discussions nationwide, from branches to district committees and provincial committees. In order to fully discuss this draft program, the PCF leadership specially postponed the congress, originally scheduled for the end of May, until today.

At the meeting on the 24th, the congress elected the presidium, including Thorez and other PCF leaders. Then, PCF Senator and Mayor of Ivry, Georges Marrane, delivered a brief speech of welcome to the delegates.

Thorez then gave a report on the first item on the agenda.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 24th -- Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, delivered a report on June 24th at the 15th Congress of the French Communist Party, entitled "Unite Workers and Republican Forces, Strive for the Restoration and Reform of Democracy." This was the first item on the congress's agenda.

Thorez said that since the 14th Congress of the French Communist Party, the main characteristic of France has been the destruction of the democratic system and the establishment of a system of personal autocracy. This system relies on the support of the most backward, extremely militaristic, and colonial elements of the big bourgeoisie. This system has opened the path to fascism.

Thorez emphasized that in the events that occurred in 1958, the French Communist Party was the main force resisting reactionary forces, and it did not betray the trust of the working people and the people of the whole country. On the other hand, the leaders of the right-wing Socialist Party have stubbornly insisted on their policy of splitting the working class, and the leaders of parties and groups representing the interests of the petty bourgeoisie and the liberal bourgeoisie have not been able to get rid of anti-communist prejudices. Due to the mistakes of the splitters, the military rebellion and conspiracies of the big bourgeois fascist elements were able to succeed.

Thorez analyzed the accelerated concentration of capital and the increased exploitation of the working people under the system of personal autocracy. He said that currently in France, a small number of financial groups control the economic lifeline. Five interconnected trusts control 72% of total steel production; two trusts control the entire production of aluminum; four joint companies produce 98% of all automobile production; one trust controls 80% of the production of superphosphate, and so on. And new industrial sectors—electronics, petrochemicals, synthetic fibers—also belong entirely to capitalist companies.

Thorez emphasized that the large monopoly organizations have strengthened their control over the state, and their profits are constantly rising, which is achieved by lowering the wages of workers and reducing the living standards of peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie.

Thorez then pointed out the current economic recession in France. He said that the economic recession is a phenomenon of the entire capitalist world, but in France, it has been exacerbated by the Algerian War and the entry into force of the "Common Market."

Thorez condemned the government's anti-worker social policies and exposed various lies used to deceive the working people, such as "people's capitalism."

Thorez then spoke about the most complex and acute problem facing France today—the Algerian War. He called this war "a carbuncle on France's body." Thorez said that this war has fostered racism and chauvinism, brought countless atrocities, and that the army conducting the colonial war in Algeria will inevitably become an army for domestic war against the French people. Thorez said that the divisions between the various factions of French colonialism are secondary, and all the solutions they have proposed have not taken into account the national aspirations and the right to independence of the Algerian people.

Thorez demanded an immediate end to this endless war. He said that, faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism, the French Communist Party solemnly reaffirms that the Algerian people have the right to independence.

Thorez continued, saying that the foreign policy of the de Gaulle regime aims to maintain and deepen tensions, which directly violates the desire of the French people for the easing of international tensions, for security, and for disarmament. The government needs the "Cold War" in order to continue the war in Algeria, to consolidate the reactionary regime in France, and to oppose democracy and socialism in Europe and throughout the world for the benefit of the monopoly organizations. The French government has established the closest relations with West Germany, the clerical government of Italy, and Franco's Spain. The French government opposes solving the most important problems in Europe: normalizing the situation in the center of the European continent, separating the opposing armed forces, concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and solving the problem of West Berlin, the source of conspiracies and subversive activities in the heart of the German Democratic Republic.

Thorez emphasized that under the conditions that the international situation has changed since the war, the adventurous policy of the French government does not conform to the general trend of the international situation, which is the easing of tensions. Because the face of the world has changed, the socialist state system has an increasingly strong influence on the international situation, thus promoting the peace, progress, and freedom of all peoples.

In his report, Thorez analyzed in detail the development of the anti-personal autocracy movement in France. He proposed a plan to reform the republican system and national life, as a concrete program for an alliance between the working class, working peasants, intellectuals, and the urban middle class, and as a concrete program for an alliance between the French Communist Party and other democratic parties.

Thorez said that in the political sphere, the French Communist Party advocates that a truly democratic political system be adopted by a constituent assembly based on the following principles: In the republic, the highest power belongs to the representatives of the people, who are elected by direct proportional representation through universal suffrage, and form a single National Assembly. The government is formed by the parliament and is accountable to the parliament. Proportional representation applies to all elections, and members of parliament can be recalled. The law guarantees freedom and human rights, and government personnel who violate freedom and human rights should be severely punished.

The Communist Party advocates the nationalization of monopoly enterprises, especially the atomic industry, the petroleum industry, large-scale steelmaking and chemical industries, commercial banks, and insurance companies. At the same time, the leadership and management of large state-owned companies and enterprises should be democratized.

Regarding the transition to socialism, Thorez said: The working class is concerned with completing the socialist revolution through peaceful means, thereby avoiding chaos and preventing the destruction of productive forces. Workers do not like to use violence. Whether violence is used depends on the extent to which the exploiters resist the will of the people, and on the methods of struggle they use.

Thorez said that in any case, the transition is the result of sharp class struggle. The revolution must destroy the old state machinery and replace it with another state machinery composed of people's forces, so that it can serve the dictatorship of the proletariat, establish a true democratic system for all working people, and establish the social ownership of the main means of production.

Thorez said that the slogan put forward by the French Communist Party is: We must make every effort to build a republican bloc to oppose the capitalist reactionaries, oppose militarism and clerical reactionaries, strengthen the democratic counter-offensive, gradually become an irresistible force, make every effort to achieve a united front of the working class, and achieve the unity of the working class and the middle class.

The last part of Thorez's report was about the party. He pointed out that as of June 1 this year, the number of party members has increased by 120,000 compared with the same period last year.

Thorez said that the Communist Party has proved to be the main force in the opposition, and it is able to unite all republicans to deal with the reactionary and fascist attacks. Now, the party is fighting on two fronts, both against revisionism and opportunism, and against sectarianism. Special attention must be paid to the purity of the party's theoretical and practical line. Thorez said, "We are full of confidence in the political vision of the working class, in the ability of the working class to mobilize allies, and in the will of the people to free the country from the shackles of reactionary forces. With this confidence, we are engaged in arduous battles."

    法共第十五次代表大会开幕
    多列士强调加强工人和共和力量的团结
    提出一个革新共和制度的计划作为联合斗争的纲领
    新华社巴黎24日电　法国共产党第十五次代表大会今天早晨在巴黎附近伊符里市的体育馆开幕。
    代表大会将讨论下列议程：一、团结工人和共和力量，争取恢复和革新民主制（报告人：法国共产党总书记多列士）；二、选举党的领导机构。
    这次大会将总结法国共产党从第十四次代表大会以来的活动和规划未来的工作。从今年4月以来，法国共产党党员们仔细地研究了中央委员会提出的总结党的政策的文件——第十五次代表大会纲领草案。他们倾听了劳动者对纲领草案发表的意见，并且从支部到区委会和省委会，在全国范围内进行了广泛的民主讨论。法共领导机构为了充分讨论这个纲领草案，特地把原来预定在5月底举行的代表大会延期到今天。
    在24日的会议上，大会选出了包括多列士和其他法共领导人在内的大会主席团。接着，法共参议员、伊符里市市长乔治·马兰简短致词，表示欢迎代表们。
    多列士就第一项议程作了报告。
    新华社巴黎24日电　法国共产党总书记多列士。24日在法国共产党第十五次代表大会上作了题为“团结工人和共和力量、争取恢复和革新民主制”的报告。这是大会的第一项议程。
    多列士说，从法国共产党第十四次代表大会以来，法国的主要特征是民主制度遭到破坏和建立了个人专权制度。这个制度依靠的是大资产阶级中最落后、极端军国主义和殖民主义分子的支持。这个制度开辟了走向法西斯主义的道路。
    多列士着重指出，在1958年所发生的事件中，法国共产党是抵抗反动势力的主要力量，它没有辜负劳动人民和全国人民对它的信任。而另一方面，右翼社会党领导人却一直顽固地坚持他们分裂工人力量的政策，代表小资产阶级和自由资产阶级利益的政党和集团的领导人也不能摆脱反共的偏见，由于分裂分子的过错，大资产阶级法西斯分子的军事叛乱和阴谋才能以得逞。
    多列士分析了在个人专权制度下资本集中加速和对劳动人民的剥削加强的情况，他说，目前在法国，少数财政集团控制着经济命脉。五个相互联系的托辣斯控制着全部钢产量的72％；两个托辣斯控制着整个铝的生产，四个联合公司生产的汽车占全部汽车生产的98％，一个托辣斯控制了80％的过磷酸盐的生产等等。而新的工业部门——电子学、石油化学、合成纤维——也完全属于资本主义的公司。
    多列士着重指出，大垄断组织加强了对国家的控制，它们的利润不断上升，这是靠降低职工工资，降低农民和城市小资产阶级的生活水平而得来的。
    多列士接着指出了法国目前经济衰退的情况，他说，经济衰退是整个资本主义世界的现象，但是在法国，却因为阿尔及利亚战争和“共同市场”的生效而加剧。
    多列士谴责了政府的反工人的社会政策，并揭露了用来欺骗劳动人民群众的各种谎言，例如“人民资本主义”。
    多列士接着谈到了目前法国最复杂和最尖锐的问题——阿尔及利亚战争问题。他把这场战争称作“法国身上的痈疽”。多列士说，这场战争发展了种族主义和沙文主义，带来了无数的暴行，而在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争的军队必然会成为针对法国人民的国内战争的军队。多列士说，法国殖民主义各个派别之间的分歧都是次要的，他们所提出的一切解决办法都没有考虑到阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望和独立的权利。
    多列士要求立即停止这场无止境的战争。他说，忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则的法国共产党庄严地重申，阿尔及利亚人民有独立的权利。
    多列士继续说，戴高乐政权的外交政策的目的是要保持并加深紧张局势，这直接违背法国人民要求缓和国际紧张局势、要求安全和裁军的愿望。政府之所以需要“冷战”，是为了继续在阿尔及利亚进行战争，为了巩固法国的反动政权，为了垄断组织的利益而反对欧洲和全世界的民主和社会主义。法国政府同西德、意大利教权派政府、佛朗哥西班牙建立了最密切的关系。法国政府反对解决欧洲最主要的问题：使欧洲大陆中心的局势正常化，隔离开相互对立的武装部队，缔结对德和约，解决处在德意志民主共和国中心的阴谋和颠复活动的策源地——西柏林的局势问题。
    多列士强调指出，在战后国际形势已经发生变化的条件下，法国政府的冒险政策不符合国际形势总的趋向，这种趋向是缓和紧张局势。因为世界的面貌已发生变化，社会主义国家体系对国际形势发生了日益强烈的影响，因而促进着各国人民的和平、进步和自由。
    多列士在报告中详细地分析了法国的反对个人专权运动的发展，他提出一个革新共和制度和国家生活的计划，作为工人阶级、劳动农民，知识分子和城市中等阶级之间的联盟的一个具体纲领，作为法国共产党和其他民主党派之间的联盟的一个具体纲领。
    多列士说，在政治方面，法国共产党主张由制宪议会采纳一种以下述原则为基础的真正民主的政权制度：在共和国中，最高权力属于人民的代表，代表由直接的比例投票制的普选产生，组成单一的国民议会。由议会产生政府，政府对议会负责。比例代表制适用于一切选举，议员都可以罢免。法律保障自由和人权，政府人员侵犯自由和人权者，应受到严厉制裁。
    共产党主张垄断企业国有化，特别是原子工业、石油工业、大型炼钢和化学工业、商业银行和保险公司。同时，还应该使大型国营公司和企业的领导机构和管理民主化。
    关于向社会主义过渡的问题，多列士说：工人阶级关心通过和平途径完成社会主义革命，从而避免混乱和防止破坏生产力。劳动者不喜爱使用暴力，是否使用暴力取决剥削者反抗人民意志的程度，取决于他们使用的斗争方式。
    多列士说，无论如何，过渡是尖锐的阶级斗争的结果。革命必须是摧毁旧国家机器，而由人民力量组成的另一个国家机器来代替它，从而能为无产阶级专政服务，为所有劳动人民建立真正的民主制度，建立主要生产资料的社会所有制。
    多列士说，法国共产党提出的口号是：必须全心全意作出努力，建成共和集团，来反对资本家反动派，反对军国主义和教权反动派，使民主的反攻壮大起来，逐渐成为不可抗拒的力量，尽一切努力实现工人阶级统一阵线，实现工人阶级和中等阶级的团结。
    多列士报告的最后一部分是关于党的问题。他指出，截至今年6月1日，党员人数比去年同期增加了十二万人。
    多列士说，共产党已经证明是反对派中的主要力量，它能够团结一切共和人士来对付反动派和法西斯的进攻。现在，党正在两条战线上进行斗争，既反对修正主义和机会主义，又反对宗派主义。尤其必须注意党的理论和实践路线的纯洁。多列士说，“我们对工人阶级的政治远见，对工人阶级有能力动员同盟者，对人民使国家摆脱反动势力束缚的意愿，满怀着信心，我们凭着这种信心从事艰巨的战斗。”
