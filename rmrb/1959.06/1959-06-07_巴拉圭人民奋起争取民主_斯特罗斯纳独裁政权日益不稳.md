　　Asunción dispatch: The Paraguayan dictatorial regime is increasingly unstable. Dictator Stroessner has again declared a nationwide "state of emergency," and internal divisions within the ruling National Republican Party have also become more serious.

　　It is reported that hundreds of students in Asunción, the capital of Paraguay, held a rally in "Italian Square" on May 28 to protest the government's increase in bus fares. The government sent police to attack the students with tear gas, causing injuries to many. This atrocity aroused unanimous indignation among students throughout the city, and almost all student organizations announced a strike. Female high school students also held demonstrations.

　　In a state of panic, the Stroessner government hurriedly announced on May 30 that the country would remain in a "state of emergency" for another sixty days. Large numbers of police forces patrolled Asunción and other cities. The government also ordered all schools and vocational schools to be closed for two weeks. However, the dictator's bloody suppression did not stop the students' just actions. On the 2nd, Paraguayan university students held another demonstration to oppose Ruyat Bella continuing as police chief. The news said that a group of students holding a flag with the emblem of the National Republican Party shouted slogans against the police chief and in favor of democracy during the parade. The police dispersed them, and afterwards the Paraguayan authorities ordered the arrest of members of the "Blas Garay" organization of National Republican Party university students. On the same day, doctors at the experimental hospital announced a twenty-four-hour strike to protest the arrest of their colleagues and the police's atrocities in front of the hospital yesterday. At that time, the army rode horses towards the gate, rushed up the steps, and dispersed a group of doctors and nurses.

　　It is also reported that six leaders of the National Republican Party were arrested after the declaration of a "state of emergency." Insiders believe that these politicians were arrested because they encouraged the parliament to protest the police's atrocities against demonstrating students. Fourteen members of the recently dissolved House of Representatives from the National Republican Party were arrested. Prior to this, César Garay, the Minister of Justice of the dictatorial government, resigned. It is generally believed that these are manifestations of deep divisions within Stroessner's party.

　　The Stroessner regime is one of the few remaining dictatorial regimes in Latin America. The Cuban people's victory in overthrowing Batista's dictatorial tyrant has greatly encouraged the Paraguayan people's anti-dictatorial struggle.

    巴拉圭人民奋起争取民主
    斯特罗斯纳独裁政权日益不稳
    本报讯　亚松森消息：巴拉圭独裁政权日益不稳，独裁者斯特罗斯纳又宣布全国处于“紧急状态”，执政党国家共和党的内部分歧也更加严重。
    据报道，巴拉圭首都亚松森的学生数百名，为抗议政府提高公共汽车票价，曾于5月28日在“意大利广场”举行集会表示抗议。政府派警察用催泪瓦斯袭击学生，致使许多学生受伤。这一暴行激起了全市学生的一致愤慨，几乎所有的学生组织都宣布了罢课，女子中学的学生还举行了游行示威。
    斯特罗斯纳政府在惊慌之余，急忙在5月30日宣布全国继续处于“紧急状态”六十天。大批警察部队在亚松森和其他城市巡逻。政府并命令一切学校和专科学校放假两星期。但是，独裁者的血腥镇压并没有阻挡住学生的正义行动。2日，巴拉圭大学生又举行了示威游行，反对鲁亚特·贝拉继续担任警察长。消息说，拿着一面有国家共和党党徽的旗子的一群学生，在游行时高喊反对警察长和欢呼民主万岁的口号。警察驱散了他们，事后巴拉圭当局下令逮捕国家共和党大学生组织“布拉斯·加赖”的人员。同一天，实验医院的医生宣布二十四小时的罢工，抗议逮捕他们的同行，抗议警察昨天在医院前的暴行。当时军队骑着马冲向大门，冲上了台阶，驱散了一群医生和护士。
    另据报道，国家共和党的六名领袖在宣布“紧急状态”后被捕。熟悉内幕的人士认为，这些政治家之所以被捕是因为他们鼓动议会抗议警察对示威学生的暴行。最近解散的众议院，有十四个国家共和党的议员被捕。在这以前，独裁政府的司法部长塞萨·加赖辞职。一般认为，这都是斯特罗斯纳政党内部发生深刻分歧的表现。
    斯特罗斯纳政权是拉丁美洲几个残存的独裁政权之一，古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁暴君的胜利，大大鼓舞了巴拉圭人民的反独裁斗争。
