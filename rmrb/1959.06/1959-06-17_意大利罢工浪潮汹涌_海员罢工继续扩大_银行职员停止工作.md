Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 16th: The strike wave in Italy continues to surge. Following the seamen's strike, 80,000 bank employees across the country began a strike yesterday, demanding higher wages and improved living conditions. The strike was initiated by the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the Catholic "Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions," the Social Democratic "Italian Labor Union," and other bank staff union organizations.

Prior to this, Italian bank employees had also held a 48-hour strike on May 8th and 9th. However, their demands have not been met.

In Genoa, which is feeling the strongest impact of the seamen's strike, 25,000 metallurgical workers held a demonstration in the city center yesterday to protest the planned layoffs by two machine manufacturing plants. Local police interfered with the workers' demonstration, resulting in clashes. Subsequently, the police made arrests.

The Italian seamen's strike, which began on June 9th, continues to expand. Crews engaged in both domestic and international shipping have joined the strike. As a result of the strike, more than 40 Italian ships are paralyzed in foreign ports alone. Tugboat crews in major Italian ports have also decided to join the strike.

    意大利罢工浪潮汹涌
    海员罢工继续扩大　银行职员停止工作
    新华社16日讯　罗马消息：意大利的罢工浪潮在继续高涨。继海员罢工之后，全国八万银行职员昨天又开始了罢工，要求提高工资和改善生活条件。罢工是由意大利总工会、天主教的“意大利劳动人民工会联合会”和社会民主党的“意大利劳工联盟”及银行工作人员的其他工会组织发动的。
    在这以前，意大利银行职员于5月8日和9日也曾经举行了四十八小时的罢工。但是，他们的要求一直没有得到满足。
    在最能感受到海员罢工的威力的热那亚，昨天有二万五千冶金工人在市中心示威游行，抗议两个机器制造厂打算解雇工人。当地警察干涉工人的示威，同工人发生了冲突。接着警察还进行了逮捕。
    从9日开始的意大利海员罢工在继续扩大。从事国内航运和国际航运的船员都参加了罢工的行列。由于罢工，仅仅是瘫痪在外国港口的意大利海轮就有四十多艘。意大利主要港口的拖驳轮船员也决定参加罢工。
