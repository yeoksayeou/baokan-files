    Thoughts Inspired by the Film "Wangjiang Pavilion"
    Zhang Danian
    I recently saw the color opera film "Wangjiang Pavilion" starring the famous Peking Opera actress Zhang Junqiu, and I think it is both a good movie and a good opera. This also gave rise to some associations:
    I hope that the film department can shoot more excellent opera films, which is very beneficial. Because China's opera heritage is very rich, and many excellent plays have always been performed on stage, such as the great Chinese playwright Guan Hanqing's "Wangjiang Pavilion" (also known as "Tan Jier"), which is one of them. The people love these plays. How to make our rich and colorful excellent operas more widely disseminated and enrich the cultural life of the people is a very important issue. However, due to some limitations, it is relatively difficult to see excellent traditional plays frequently in small and medium-sized cities and the vast rural areas. Therefore, we can make full use of the film, the most popular art form, to shoot more opera films that are appreciated by both the refined and the popular, and are welcomed by the old and the young. This is the most popular style among the masses. This can not only meet the needs of more people, allowing them to spend less money and time to enjoy excellent plays and see the wonderful performances of excellent actors; but also make the excellent plays and the performances of the actors passed down for a long time.
    Secondly, opera films show opera, so it has the characteristics of opera; on the other hand, it is a film, so it has the characteristics of film. Therefore, I hope that opera films will not only retain the essence and characteristics of excellent operas, but also make full use of the unique artistic techniques of film, so that the two can be well combined, and make this kind of film a unique artistic creation.
    I think the film "Wangjiang Pavilion" has done a good job in this regard. For example, in the scene where Tan Jier cleverly disguises herself as a fisherwoman and comes to Wangjiang Pavilion, the background of the picture is the green mountains and rivers, and a line of light shines from Wangjiang Pavilion. Tan Jier, wearing a green dress and a raincoat, appears on the river bank, and the moonlight softly shines on her body. This scene not only does not hinder the symbolic expression of opera, but also increases the realism of the drama. On the other hand, the actress Zhang Junqiu, who plays Tan Jier, uses traditional opera techniques and her mellow and beautiful singing to skillfully create the image of a woman who boldly despises the rulers of feudal society and bravely fights against them. The scenes of Tan Jier and Bai Shizhong swearing an oath of lifelong commitment, cleverly obtaining the Shangfang Sword and the imperial decree at Wangjiang Pavilion, and scolding Yang Yanei in court, vividly express Tan Jier's love for her husband and her hatred for the rulers and oppressors, deeply and humorously exposing and mocking the foolish and shameless rulers. Because the film "Wangjiang Pavilion" combines the two artistic characteristics well, it complements each other and makes it gain the audience's praise.
    We also have many other excellent opera films, such as "The Fairy Couple" and "Fifteen Strings of Cash", which have also done well in this regard. The audience's welcome to them sometimes even exceeds that of general art films. But some films are too拘泥to the stage's symbolic performance, or do not pay attention to the good use of film art techniques, which makes people feel that there are shortcomings. As an audience, I hope that opera films can blossom more luxuriant flowers, so that our film art can develop more vigorously.

### 从影片“望江亭”想起的

    从影片“望江亭”想起的
    张大年
    我最近看到了由京剧名演员张君秋主演的彩色戏曲影片“望江亭”，觉得它既是好电影，又是好戏。由此也产生了一些联想：
    我希望电影部门能够多拍摄几部优秀的戏曲影片，这很有好处。因为我国戏曲的遗产非常丰富，许多优秀的剧目历来在舞台上上演不衰，像我国伟大戏剧家关汉卿的“望江亭”（又名“谭记儿”）就是其中之一。人民是爱好这些剧目的。如何使我们丰富多采的优秀戏曲，更广泛地传播，丰富人民的文化生活，这是很重要的问题。但是目前由于一些条件的限制，在中小城市以及广大农村，要想经常看到优秀的传统剧目是比较困难的。因此，大可以利用电影这一群众性最大的艺术形式，多多拍摄雅俗共赏、老少欢迎的戏曲电影。这是最受群众欢迎的样式。这样既能满足更多群众的要求，使他们花钱不多，费时很少，便能欣赏优秀剧目，看到优秀演员精彩表演；又使优秀剧目和演员的表演传之久远。
    其次，戏曲影片表现的是戏曲，所以它具有戏曲的特点；另一方面它又是影片，它又具有电影的特点。因此，希望在戏曲影片中，既保持优秀戏曲的精华和特点，又能充分运用电影特有的艺术技巧，使二者很好结合起来，使这种影片成为有独特风格的艺术创造。
    我以为影片“望江亭”在这方面是做得较好的。比如谭记儿巧扮渔妇来到望江亭那一折，画面远处是碧绿的山光水色，一线灯光从望江亭上透射出来。谭记儿着绿色衣裙，披蓑衣出现在江岸上，月光柔和地洒在她的身上。此情此境不但没有妨碍戏曲象征性的表现方法，还增加了戏剧的真实感。另一方面，扮演谭记儿的演员张君秋，运用传统的戏曲手法，和他圆润柔美的唱腔，精炼地塑造出了一个大胆蔑视封建社会的统治者，机智勇敢地同他们进行斗争的妇女的形象。谭记儿和白士中盟誓订终身、望江亭上巧取上方宝剑和圣旨、公堂上斥骂杨衙内这几折戏，把谭记儿对丈夫的爱和对统治者、压迫者的恨，淋漓尽致地表现出来了，深刻而又诙谐地揭露和嘲弄了愚蠢而无耻的统治者。由于影片
  “望江亭”对二种艺术特性结合得好，因此相得益彰，使它获得观众的赞赏。
    我们也还有许多其他的优秀戏曲影片，如“天仙配”、“十五贯”等，也是在这方面做得较好的，观众对它们的欢迎，有的甚至超过一般艺术片。但也有些影片过分拘泥于舞台象征性的表演，或者没有注意很好地运用电影艺术技巧，就令人感到美中不足。作为一个观众，我希望戏曲影片能多开几朵枝叶茂盛的鲜花，使我们的电影艺术更加蓬勃的发展。
