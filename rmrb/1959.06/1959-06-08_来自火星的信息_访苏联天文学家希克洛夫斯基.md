    Information from Mars
    ——An Interview with Soviet Astronomer Shklovsky
    By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang

    On a moonless summer night, when you look up and see the sky full of stars, you must think of the greatness of the universe, and also wonder how many other “worlds” there are in that vast and boundless distance. Humanity's research on the universe has a long history, and our understanding of the universe has increased with the development of science and technology. Today's astronomers can tell you the size of any planet, its surface temperature, and even its history of formation. But astronomers will also tell you that our understanding of the universe is still very limited. The knowledge we have is truly just a "drop in the ocean" compared to the phenomena we have yet to understand!

    On May 1st of this year, the Soviet newspaper "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article by Soviet scientist Shklovsky, putting forward the hypothesis that there are artificial satellites on Mars. This news quickly spread around the world, arousing widespread interest. Many people rethought many stories about Mars. Soviet people still remember A. Tolstoy's novel "Aelita," which describes life on Mars. Some still remember the legend of the discovery of "canals" on Mars, and the incredible stories of receiving radio messages from Mars. Now that Professor Shklovsky says there are artificial satellites on Mars, it will naturally attract widespread interest and attention.

    On a clear morning in mid-May, we arrived at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Moscow University to visit Comrade Shklovsky.

    Comrade Shklovsky’s new theory has received many reactions in various countries around the world. Today, reporters from the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia are also visiting with us. Comrade Shklovsky said: "Before we start talking, please allow me to make a condition, that is, only talk about scientific research based on facts. Because I know that reporters like to look for fresh things and have quite rich imaginations. But I should state that I study exact sciences, and I am an amateur when it comes to fantasy novels, so I can only talk about facts based on scientific facts." We all agreed to this condition. Then Comrade Shklovsky began his narrative.

    However, before we begin Professor Shklovsky's narrative, it is necessary to introduce the general situation of Mars and its satellites. Mars is one of the nine major planets in the solar system. Its average distance from the sun is 228 million kilometers. If we consider its proximity to the sun, it ranks fourth, a bit farther than Earth, but its mass is only one-tenth of Earth's. Mars also has day and night and seasons. The time it takes for Mars to rotate once is only forty-one minutes longer than the time it takes for Earth to rotate once. There are also two satellites revolving around Mars. As early as 1726, British writer Jonathan Swift guessed that Mars had two satellites in his famous book "Gulliver's Travels." In 1877, American astronomer Hall scientifically discovered these two satellites, which are the so-called "Phobos" and "Deimos"; their scientific names are "Phobos" (Latin for "fear") and "Deimos" (Latin for "terror"). "Phobos" is closer to Mars, and its distance from the surface of Mars is 6,000 kilometers, while "Deimos" is 23,000 kilometers from the surface of Mars.

    Comrade Shklovsky began his narration by saying: “'Phobos' and 'Deimos' are very difficult to see from the ground. They can only be seen with the best telescopes when Mars and Earth are relatively close. In the telescope, they are nothing more than two small white dots revolving around Mars.”

    Professor Shklovsky said that he started studying the Martian satellites a long time ago. In February of this year, he finally concluded this long-term exploration and wrote a scientific paper entitled "On the Reasons for the Acceleration of the Movement Speed of 'Phobos'," in which he concluded that the two satellites on Mars are artificial.

    After briefly recounting this history, Comrade Shklovsky stood up, walked to the blackboard, and began to talk about the scientific arguments for this conclusion as if he were lecturing to students. He said: "Russian astronomer Struve accurately calculated the law of motion of 'Phobos' fifty years ago. According to this law, the position of 'Phobos' in its orbit at a specified time can be calculated. But in 1945, American astronomer Sharpless discovered that the actual position of 'Phobos' differed from the theoretically derived position by two and a half degrees! This means that in the past fifty years, the movement of 'Phobos' has accelerated. What is the reason?" Comrade Shklovsky drew markings for Mars and "Phobos" on the blackboard, and then drew the orbit of "Phobos," and continued: "It is an extraordinary thing for a satellite to suddenly run two and a half degrees faster in fifty years! Because if it accelerates at this rate, 'Phobos' will fall onto Mars in fifteen million years, which is too short for astronomy, which is measured in billions of years. So, many scientists around the world began to study the reason for the acceleration of 'Phobos.' If we put together the reasons put forward by scholars from various countries, they are no more than the following: for example, the resistance of the atmosphere around Mars, the influence of 'sea tides' on Mars, the effect of the Martian magnetic field, or the gravitational force between celestial bodies, etc. I have carefully studied each explanation, but I found that none of these reasons can explain why 'Phobos' has accelerated by two and a half degrees. This is a complex process, and the entire research result is written in my scientific paper. Anyone interested in this issue can find this article in the latest issue of 'Astronomical Journal'."

    One reporter asked him to briefly explain how he reached his own conclusion. Professor Shklovsky said: “Let’s take an example. For example, some people say that the reason for the acceleration of the movement of 'Phobos' is the resistance of the atmosphere. If this atmosphere is cosmic matter, then it cannot explain why the movement speed of 'Deimos' has not accelerated. If this is the atmosphere around Mars, then according to scientists' calculations, the density of this gas at the high altitude where 'Phobos' is running should be equal to 3×10-16 grams/cubic meter, and the temperature there should be above 1,000 degrees. I did an experiment in the laboratory and heated gas with a density of 3×10-16 grams/cubic meter to 1,500 degrees. The result was that such gas could not be maintained in the Martian sky, and it could quickly dissipate into the universe. The fact is that the atmosphere around Mars has not only not dissipated but has existed for billions of years, which means that this reason is not valid. The second reason is the influence of 'sea tides' on Mars. There are no oceans on Mars. The 'sea tides' here refer to the liquid movement under the Martian crust. However, astronomers who study 'sea tides' have proved that if this 'sea tide' can play a role, then it can only explain one ten-thousandth of the acceleration of 'Phobos'. Then what is the reason for the remaining nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine ten-thousandths? Of course, this reason is also not valid. After studying other reasons, I came to the conclusion that these two satellites are not natural satellites but artificial ones."

    Someone asked: "What are the similarities between 'Phobos', 'Deimos' and artificial Earth satellites?" Shklovsky said: "The similarities are as follows: First, the volumes of 'Phobos' and 'Deimos' are very small. Currently, other than artificial Earth satellites, there have never been any satellites so small. Second, they are very close to the surface of Mars, the same as artificial Earth satellites. Third, the biggest similarity is the acceleration of the movement speed of 'Phobos', which is exactly the same as artificial Earth satellites."

    After listening to this passage, everyone present felt that the reasons were sufficient, but there were still some doubts in their minds. Professor Shklovsky seemed to see our inner activities, and he said: "Of course, the conclusion I have reached is a scientific hypothesis, not a discovery. Since it is a hypothesis, it can of course be overturned. I think only two situations can overturn my conclusion: First, if someone proves that the movement speed of 'Phobos' has not accelerated; second, if someone can more convincingly explain the reason for the acceleration of the movement of 'Phobos'. Of course, if the reporter comrades have new evidence, they can also debate."

    Such a reporter was not found on the spot.

    Our conversation has continued for more than an hour, and Comrade Shklovsky’s formulas and diagrams have filled several blackboards, and we have all been attracted by his conversation. At the end of the visit, someone asked him, if these two satellites are artificial, how were they launched? Why can they run for tens of millions of years? Are there any advanced creatures on Mars? He replied: "Our conversation can be divided into two parts. The above talked about the results of scientific work, and the following are some of my personal thoughts. The two should not be confused. There must have been advanced creatures on Mars before. I have no doubt about this. As for what these advanced creatures look like, only fantasy novel writers can tell you. 'Phobos' and 'Deimos' were made by advanced creatures. This is the conclusion I have reached. Some people say that these two satellites weigh hundreds of millions of tons, how can they be artificial? But I can say that in one or two hundred years, humans will definitely be able to manufacture such satellites. The current development of human science and technology has pointed out the way for this problem. You remember! A dozen years ago, someone said that manufacturing artificial satellites and launching them into the sky to rotate with the earth was a fantasy, a utopia! But what about today? Life has educated these conservatives. To boldly imagine, to boldly create, this is the law of human progress."

    来自火星的信息
    ——访苏联天文学家希克洛夫斯基
    本报记者　崔永昌
    在没有月亮的夏夜，当你抬头看到天上满天星斗的时候，你一定想到宇宙的伟大，也会想到在那飘渺无垠的远方，不知还有多少世外的“世界”。人类对于宇宙的研究是有着悠久历史的，并且对于宇宙的了解也随着科学技术的发展而日益增多。现在的天文学家不但可以告诉你任何一个行星的大小，它表面上的温度，并且可以告诉你它的形成的历史。但是天文学家也会告诉你说，我们对于宇宙的了解还是很少的，已有的知识和我们尚未了解的现象比较起来还真是“沧海一粟”呢！
    今年5月1日苏联“共青真理报”发表了苏联科学家希克洛夫斯基的文章，提出了火星上也有人造卫星的假设，这个消息很快地飞遍了全世界，引起了普遍的兴趣。许多人重新想了许多关于火星的故事。苏联人还记得阿·托尔斯泰描写火星上生活的小说“阿艾里塔”，有些人还记得在火星上发现“运河”的传说，也记得从前有人说用无线电收到火星上发来电讯的奇闻。现在希克洛夫斯基教授说火星上也有人造卫星，当然会受到普遍的兴趣和注意。
    5月中的一个晴朗的早晨，我们来到了莫斯科大学施坦因别尔格天文研究所，访问了希克洛夫斯基同志。
    希克洛夫斯基同志的新理论在世界各国都得到许多反映，今天和我们一起来访问的还有德意志民主共和国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的记者。希克洛夫斯基同志说：“在开始谈话之前，请允许我提出一个条件，那就是只讲以事实为根据的科学研究。因为我知道记者同志都喜欢寻找新鲜的事物，并且幻想力都相当丰富。但是我应当声明，我是研究精确科学的，对于幻想小说我是外行，因此只能就科学事实谈事实。”我们大家一致同意这个条件。然后希克洛夫斯基同志开始了他的叙述。
    不过在开始谈希克洛夫斯基教授的叙述之前，我们有必要把火星及其卫星的大概情况介绍一下。火星是太阳系中九个大行星中的一个，它和太阳的平均距离是二亿二千八百万公里，如果就与太阳接近的程度来讲它占第四位，比地球远一些，但质量只有地球的十分之一。火星上也有昼夜和四季，火星自转一周的时间只比地球自转一周的时间多四十一分钟。围绕着火星还有两颗卫星在旋转，英国作家史惠夫特早在1726年就曾在他的名著“格里弗游记”中猜想到火星有两颗卫星。1877年美国天文学家霍尔科学地发现了这两颗卫星，这就是所谓的“火卫一”和“火卫二”；它们的科学名字是“弗伯斯”（拉丁文“恐惧”的意思）和“捷摩斯”（拉丁文“可怕”的意思）。“火卫一”距火星较近，它和火星表面的距离是六千公里，而“火卫二”距火星表面则有二万三千公里。
    希克洛夫斯基同志开始叙述时说：“火卫一”和“火卫二”从地面上很难看到，它们要在火星和地球距离较近时用最好的天文望远镜才能看到，在望远镜里，它们也不过是围绕着火星旋转的两个小白点而已。”
    希克洛夫斯基教授说，对于火星卫星的研究他是很早就开始了的，今年2月他终于结束了这件积年累月的探讨，并且写出了题为“关于‘火卫一’运动速度加快之原因”的学术论文，他得出结论说，火星上的两个卫星是人造的。
    简单地叙述了这段历史以后，希克洛夫斯基同志站起来走到黑板前面，像对学生讲课一样，开始讲起了这个结论的科学论据。他说：“俄罗斯的天文学家斯特鲁威还在五十年前就曾精确地计算出了‘火卫一’的运动规律，按照这个规律可以计算出‘火卫一’在指定时间中居于运行轨道中的地位。但是在1945年美国天文学家沙尔普列斯发现‘火卫一’的实际地位比从理论上应得出的地位差出了二点五度！这也就是说在将近五十年的过程中，‘火卫一’的运动加快了。原因何在呢？”希克洛夫斯基同志在黑板上画出了火星和“火卫一”的标记，并且画出了“火卫一”的运行轨道，然后继续说：“五十年中一颗卫星忽然跑快了二点五度，这是件异乎寻常的事情！因为如果以这样速度加快下去，那么在一千五百万年以后‘火卫一’就要掉在火星上面，这对于以亿年为单位的天文学来说是为期太短了。于是世界上许多科学家都开始研究起‘火卫一’加速的原因。如果把各国学者提出的原因算在一起，不外以下几个：例如火星周围大气的阻力，火星上‘海潮’的影响，火星磁场的作用或星体间的引力等等。我对于每个解释都进行了仔细的研究，但是我发现这些原因都不能解释‘火卫一’为什么加快了二点五度。这是个复杂的过程，研究成果全部写到我的学术论文里去了，对这问题感兴趣的人可以在最近一期的‘天文学报’里找到这篇文章。”
    一位记者提出要他简单讲一下他怎样得出自己的结论的。希克洛夫斯基教授说：“我们来举一个例子吧。例如有人说‘火卫一’运动加速的原因是大气的阻力，如果说这种大气是宇宙物质，那么就不能解释为什么‘火卫二’的运动速度没有加快。如果这是火星周围的大气，那么根据科学家的计算，这种气体的密度在‘火卫一’运行的高空应当等于3×10－16克／立方公尺，那里的温度应该在一千度以上。我在实验室做了实验，把密度为3×10－16克／立方公尺的气体加热到一千五百度，结果得出结论，这样的气体在火星上空是保持不住的，它可能很快地散到宇宙中去。而事实是，火星周围的大气不但没有散去，而且存在了数十亿年，这就是说这个原因不成立。第二个原因是火星上‘海潮’的影响，火星上是没有海洋的，这里的‘海潮’指的是火星地壳下的液体运动，但是研究‘海潮’的天文学家证明，如果这种‘海潮’可以起作用，那么它只能解释‘火卫一’加快的万分之一，那么其余万分之九千九百九十九的原因又是什么呢？当然，这个原因也不成立。研究了其他原因以后，我得出结论，这两颗卫星不是天然的卫星而是人造的。”
    有人问：“火卫一”、“火卫二”和人造地球卫星有什么相同点呢？希克洛夫斯基说：“相同点是有下面这几个：第一，‘火卫一’‘火卫二’的体积都很小，目前除去地球人造卫星以外从来没有这样小的。第二，距火星表面很近，同地球人造卫星相同。第三，最大的相同点是火卫一’运动速度的加快，这一点和人造地球卫星完全相同。”
    听了这段话以后，每个在场的人都感到理由是充足的，但是脑子里毕竟还有些怀疑。希克洛夫斯基教授好像看到了我们内心的活动，他说：“当然，我得出的结论是科学的假设，它不是发现。既是假设当然可以推翻。我认为只有两种情况可以推翻我的结论：第一，如果有人证明‘火卫一’的运动速度并未加快；第二，如果有人能更信服地解释出‘火卫一’运动加速的原因。当然，如果记者同志有新的证明也可以辩论。”
    这样的记者在当场还没有发现。
    我们的谈话已经继续了一个多小时，希克洛夫斯基同志的公式、图表已经画满了几黑板，我们都被他的谈话吸引住了。在结束访问时有人问他，如果这两颗卫星是人造的，那么是怎样发射上去的？为什么可以运行千万年？火星上到底有没有高级生物？他回答说：“我们的谈话可以分成两部分，上边谈的是科学工作成果，下边是我个人的一些想法，两者不可混同。火星上以前一定有过高级生物，这一点我是毫无怀疑的，至于这种高级生物是什么样子，那么这只有幻想小说的作家才能告诉你们。‘火卫一’、‘火卫二’是高级生物制造的，这是我得出的结论，有人说这两颗卫星重有数亿吨怎么是人造的？但我可以说，过一、二百年后，人类一定可以制造这种卫星。目前人类科学技术的发展已经为这个问题指出了道路。你们还记得！十几年前有人说制造人造卫星并且发射到天空去随着地球转是幻想，是乌托邦！但是今天呢？生活教育了这些保守主义者。勇敢地幻想，勇敢地创造，这是人类前进的规律。”
