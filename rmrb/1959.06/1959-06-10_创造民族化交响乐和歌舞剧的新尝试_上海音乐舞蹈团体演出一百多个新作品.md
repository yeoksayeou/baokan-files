Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 9th – The first stage of the Shanghai Music and Dance Festival concluded on the 8th. Over sixteen days, more than a thousand performers from twenty professional and amateur music and dance groups performed over 270 programs, 60% of which were new works created by Shanghai music and dance workers since last year.

The works participating in the festival were rich and varied, covering all kinds of themes and forms. Many works made attempts at creating nationalized symphonic music and song and dance dramas and achieved success.

The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performed three new symphonies: Wang Yunjie's Second Symphony, "Anti-Japanese War Symphony," Shi Yongkang's "Dawn of the Orient Symphony," and Sha Mei's First Symphony, "Happy Life Symphony." The "Anti-Japanese War Symphony" unfolds its combative theme with the sound of a bugle call similar to the "March of the Volunteers" as an "introduction." In the first movement, "During the Anti-Japanese War," the composer focuses on depicting the suffering and hardships endured by the people during the war, which ultimately transforms into a powerful force resisting aggression. In the second movement, "Memories of Suffering," one can hear a violin solo describing the people's displacement during the war, as well as the frantic shouts of the Japanese invaders. The following chapter, "To the Enemy's Rear," expresses the magnificent spirit of the guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. The final movement, "Celebrating Victory," presents a grand scene of national rejoicing, ending with the theme "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China," expressing the heroic spirit of the Chinese people continuing to advance bravely under the leadership of the Communist Party. The entire symphony successfully handled this significant historical subject with a relatively complete artistic conception and national style. Coupled with an outstanding performance, it further enhanced the symphony's appeal.

The violin concerto "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," created and performed by students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, was considered a successful attempt at nationalizing symphonic music. This sonata was created by students He Zhanhao and Ren Gang. They used some melodies from Yue Opera as material and used Western musical forms to express the widely circulated Chinese story of "Liang Zhu." It broke through the usual rules of symphonic music and adopted a dramatic narrative method. The entire piece not only has the traditional form of a sonata but also is full of national sentiment.

In the festival, "Ode to the Huangpu River," "Huangpu River Chorus," "Happy River Chorus," the male bass solo "Old Driver," the pipa solo "Happy Days," and the dizi solo "Past and Present" were also well received. "Huangpu River Chorus" is a work by the Shanghai Chorus, who have performed it many times and revised it six or seven times based on audience feedback. The chorus's Shanghai folk song medley "Wo Ni Gongshe Jiaoguan Hao" (i.e., "Our Commune is Very Good"), with its strong local flavor, aroused the audience's interest.

The Shanghai Experimental Opera House, the Children's Art Theater, and other units performed many new dances, dance dramas, and operas. The dance "Night Raid" shapes the image of ancient Chinese warriors who are strong, resourceful, and brave through dance postures such as training, ambushing, and sneaking into enemy camps. In the "Goose Feather Fan" dance, which is refined and processed based on Jiangnan folk dances, twelve girls holding snow-white goose feather fans dance gracefully, with their arms stretching and contracting, like the wings of white geese, full of poetry and moving. This dance is the result of the Shanghai Experimental Opera House's directors and actors "gathering folk songs" among the masses.

A large number of traditional programs and excellent foreign works were also performed during the festival. Female singer Dong Ailin sang a section from the opera "Aida" this time, grasping the psychological characteristics of the princess in the play and showing her insidious jealousy and strong love character.

During the festival, Shanghai music and dance professionals were divided into four groups: creation, performing arts, dance, and opera, and held nearly ten seminars. In accordance with the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," they conducted lively discussions on issues such as inheriting and carrying forward the traditions of national and folk music and dance, learning from the valuable experience of world music culture, and creating socialist national music and dance art.

    创造民族化交响乐和歌舞剧的新尝试
    上海音乐舞蹈团体演出一百多个新作品
    新华社上海9日电　上海市音乐舞蹈会演8日结束了第一阶段的演出。十六天中，二十个专业和业余的音乐舞蹈团体一千多位演员，演出了二百七十多个节目，其中有60％是上海音乐舞蹈工作者去年以来的新作。
    参加会演的作品丰富多采，各种题材和形式都有。许多作品在创造民族化的交响音乐和歌舞剧方面作了尝试，取得了成绩。
    上海交响乐团演出了三个新的交响乐：王云阶的第二交响乐“抗日战争交响乐”，施咏康的“东方的曙光交响乐”和沙梅的第一交响乐“幸福生活交响乐”。“抗日战争交响乐”在近似“义勇军进行曲”冲锋号角的“引子”声中，展开了它的战斗性的主题。作者在第一乐章“抗战中”，着重表现了人民在战争中所受的困苦磨难，最后化为反抗侵略的雄浑的力量。第二乐章“苦难的回忆”中，可以听到描述抗战期间人民颠沛流离的小提琴独奏，可以听到日本侵略军的疯狂叫嚣声。接着的一章“到敌人后方”，表现了敌后游击战争的雄伟气魄。最后一个乐章“欢庆胜利”，出现了全民欢腾的伟大场面，以“没有共产党就没有新中国”这一主题作结束，奏出了中国人民在共产党领导下，继续英勇前进的气势。整个交响乐以比较完整的艺术构思和民族风格，成功地处理了这一重大的历史题材。加上出色的演奏，更使这个交响乐生色。
  上海音乐学院学生创作和演出的小提琴协奏曲“梁山伯与祝英台”，被认为在交响音乐的民族化方面，作了一次成功的尝试。这首奏鸣曲是学生何占豪和任钢创作的，他们以越剧的部分曲调为素材，用西洋音乐形式来表现我国广泛流传的“梁祝”故事，它突破了交响音乐惯常的法则，采用了戏剧叙述的方法，整个乐曲既具有奏鸣曲的传统形式，又富于民族的情调。
    会演中的“黄浦江颂”、“黄浦江大合唱”、“幸福河大合唱”、男低音独唱“老司机”、琵琶独奏“欢乐的日子”、笛子独奏“今昔”等，也都得到好评。“黄浦江大合唱”是上海合唱团的作品，他们已经作过多次演出，根据听众意见，修改了六、七次。合唱团的一首上海民歌联唱“我伲公社交关好”
  （即：我们的公社十分好），以它浓厚的乡土气息，引起了听众的兴趣。
    上海实验歌剧院、儿童艺术剧院等单位演出了许多舞蹈、舞剧和歌剧的新作。舞蹈“夜袭”，通过练兵、埋伏、偷袭敌营等舞姿，塑造了中国古代武士雄健、机智、英勇的形象。在江南民间舞蹈基础上提炼加工而成的“鹅毛扇”舞中，十二个手持雪白鹅毛扇的少女翩翩起舞，双臂伸张曲缩，犹如白鹅的翅膀，富有诗意，宛转动人。这个舞蹈是上海实验歌剧院的编导和演员们在群众中“采风”的成果。
    会演中还演出大量的传统节目和外国优秀作品。女歌唱家董爱琳这次演唱了歌剧“阿依达”中的一段，抓住了剧中公主的心理特征，表现出她的阴险妒忌而又有强烈爱情的性格。
    在会演期间，上海音乐舞蹈界人士分成创作、表演艺术、舞蹈、歌剧四个组，举行了近十次座谈会，根据“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，对继承和发扬民族、民间音乐舞蹈的传统，学习借鉴世界音乐文化的宝贵经验，创造社会主义的民族的音乐歌舞艺术等问题，进行了热烈的讨论。
