Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 26th. After more than ten days and nights of battle, the people of Guangdong Province have repelled the flood peaks of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers and have basically overcome the largest flood peak in the downstream water network area of the Pearl River Delta. Today, the water levels of the Xijiang River, Beijiang River, and all rivers in the Pearl River Delta river network area continue to fall slowly; the flood threat to Guangzhou City for the past ten days has been completely lifted; and most of the embankments in the Pearl River Delta river network area have basically passed through the dangerous period safely. At present, all anti-flood forces are vigilantly guarding the embankments, determined to achieve the final victory against the flood.

After this flood peak entered the sea on the morning of the 25th, although the floodwaters in all rivers in the Xijiang River, Beijiang River, and Pearl River Delta retreated slowly, the water levels were falling in a straight line. At 8:00 AM today, the Xijiang River water level near Gaoyao City had dropped to 10.72 meters, 0.09 meters lower than the water level of June 22nd before the arrival of this flood peak. The Beijiang River water level in Qingyuan City had receded to 11.92 meters at 8:00 AM this morning, 0.08 meters lower than the warning water level. The Zhongshun Embankment river section, at the junction of Zhongshan County and Fanshun County, which is representative of water level changes in the Pearl River Delta, also fell to 3.38 meters at 12:00 PM today, 0.47 meters lower than the highest water level of 3.85 meters when this flood peak arrived, and slightly lower than the water level of 3.52 meters before the arrival of this flood peak. The person in charge of the Foshan Special District Flood Control Headquarters said today that the water level of most embankments in the Pearl River Delta can return to the water level before the arrival of this flood peak today.

As of 5:00 PM today, due to the slow retreat of the floodwaters (rapid retreat can also easily cause bank collapse), the weather being windless and rainless, and the excellent protection of most embankments, the occurrence of bank collapses, seepage, and other phenomena has been greatly reduced.

It has now been ascertained that the Nantieding Embankment in Nanhai County, which collapsed and was flooded, is a large embankment with a total area of more than 50,000 mu of dry rice, cash crops, and fish ponds (yesterday it was reported as a medium-sized embankment with 20,000 mu of farmland). Before the embankment collapsed on the evening of the 24th, more than 29,000 of the entire embankment's population of more than 40,000 had been evacuated. After the embankment collapsed, the Secretary of the Nanhai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Deputy County Head immediately led more than 500 people, driving more than 270 boats of various sizes, to the embankment to rescue the 11,000 people from seven large production teams who were trapped by the water. Yesterday, the population of five large production teams was rescued, and the remaining two large production teams, because they live on high ground, the government has made arrangements for their lives and transported grain to them. The Lianhe Embankment in Gaoyao County is a small embankment with more than 2,500 mu of farmland. Before the embankment collapsed, the early rice had already been harvested, and this time only more than 200 mu of cash crops were flooded. All residents of the embankment had been evacuated before the embankment collapsed.

The floodwaters in the rivers of the Pearl River Delta river network this time are larger than the floods in mid-July 1949 before liberation. At that time, in the vast area of the delta from Foshan City in the northeast, from Ganzhu in the old Shunde County in the northwest, to the sea in the south, all flood water levels were one to four inches lower than the flood peak this time, but at that time 48 large and medium-sized embankments collapsed, and more than one million mu of farmland were flooded. This time, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the peasants of each embankment heightened all embankments by one meter in a few days before the arrival of the flood peak, and after the arrival of the flood peak, they launched a tenacious struggle against the flood. Therefore, among the 187 large and medium-sized embankments protecting six million mu of fertile land, only the Nantieding Embankment breached, but no residents of the entire embankment died.

Now, although the pressure of the flood on the embankments of the Pearl River Delta and the embankments on both sides of the Beijiang and Xijiang Rivers is small, the water level of most rivers is still very high, and the danger has not been eliminated.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 26th. Heavy rain has caused disasters in the Gannan, Ji'an, Jiujiang and other areas of Jiangxi Province, and local party and government organs are leading the masses in vigorous flood fighting and disaster relief.

From June 1st to 20th, most areas of Jiangxi Province experienced four heavy rainfalls. Due to continuous heavy rain, mountain torrents broke out, and the water levels of the Ganjiang and Xiushui Rivers rose sharply. On June 21st, the water level of Mianjin in Wan'an County in the upper reaches of the Ganjiang River reached 79.16 meters, 9 centimeters higher than the highest water level on record (1956).

All parts of Jiangxi Province had made relatively adequate flood control preparations before the flood season, and took many emergency measures to deal with emergencies when the floods arrived, but in the end, due to the excessive concentration of rainfall and the too rapid outbreak of mountain torrents, serious disasters were caused in some areas. According to incomplete statistics, more than two million mu of farmland in the province were flooded. The worst-hit areas are Shicheng, Ningdu, Xingguo, and Xinfeng in the Gannan Administrative Region, Ji'an, Taihe, Jishui, and Wan'an in the Ji'an Special District, and Yongxiu and Wuning in the Jiujiang Special District.

At present, it is still raining in some parts of Gannan. The water level of some rivers in Jiangxi Province is still rising, and the water level at the Dingjiadu Hydrological Station in the middle and lower reaches of the Ganjiang River exceeded the warning line on the 25th. The Chinese Communist Party committees in counties along the river and lakes have mobilized cadres and the masses to step up preparations for flood prevention and emergency rescue, protect the safety of embankments, and prevent the collapse of reservoirs to avoid losses. The Chinese Communist Party committees and cadres at all levels in the disaster-stricken areas are helping the people in the disaster areas repair houses and furniture, solve the difficulties in production and life such as farming cattle, farm tools, clothing, and bedding, and fully mobilize the masses to do a good job in washing seedlings, transplanting seedlings, replanting seedlings, and changing crops in a timely manner, striving for a bumper harvest of crops and ensuring that no land is left uncultivated. At the same time, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee has decided to allocate 370,000 yuan to provide timely relief to the people in the disaster-stricken areas of the Gannan Administrative Region and the Jiujiang Special District.

    西江北江大堤安然无恙  珠江三角洲水位续降
    广东基本战胜特大洪峰
    江西部分地区暴雨成灾，当地人民抗洪救灾
    据新华社广州26日电　广东省人民经过十多天来的日夜战斗，已经击退了西江、北江的洪峰，也基本上战胜了珠江三角洲下游水网地带的最大洪峰。今天，西江、北江和珠江三角洲河网地带各江河的水位继续缓落；广州市十天来所受的洪水威胁已经完全解除；珠江三角洲河网地带大部分堤围也基本上安全地渡过危险时期。目前，各路抗洪大军正在警惕地守卫着堤围，决心取得抗洪的最后胜利。
    这次洪峰在25日晨入海后，西江、北江和珠江三角洲内所有江河的洪水虽然退得不快，但水位都在直线降落。到今晨八时，高要城附近的西江水位已降到一零点七二公尺，比这次洪峰到来以前6月22日的水位低了零点零九公尺。清远城的北江水位，今日早晨八时已退到十一点九二公尺，比警戒水位低零点零八公尺。珠江三角洲内水位变化有代表性的中山县、番顺县交界的中顺大围河口段，今日上午十二时也落到三点三八公尺，比此次洪峰到来时的最高水位三点八五公尺低零点四七公尺，比此次洪峰到来前的水位三点五二公尺也略低一些。佛山专区防汛指挥部负责人今日说，珠江三角洲绝大部分堤围的水位今日可以恢复到这次洪峰到来以前的水位。
    到今天十七时止，因洪水缓缓后退（退得猛，也容易崩堤），天气无风无雨，再加绝大部分堤围防护得好，堤围发生塌坡、渗水等现象已经大大减少。
    今天已经查明：堤崩被淹的南海县南铁鼎围，是有旱稻、经济作物和鱼塘面积共达五万多亩的大围（昨天报为有二万多亩农田的中型堤围）。全围四万多人口，在24日晚堤崩以前，就有二万九千多人撤走。堤崩后，中共南海县委书记和副县长立即率领五百多人，驾驶大小船只二百七十多条，赶往围内抢救被水围困的七个大队的一万一千人。昨天即救出了五个大队的人口，其余二个大队，因居住在高地上，政府对他们的生活已作了安排，并运去了粮食。高鹤县联合围是有二千五百多亩农田的小围，堤崩前，早稻已经收完，这次只有二百多亩经济作物被淹。围内居民，在堤崩前即已全部撤走。
    这次珠江三角洲河网地带各江河的洪水比解放前1949年7月中旬的洪水大。那次，三角洲内东北自佛山市以下，西北自旧顺德县治的甘竹以下，南迄大海的广大地区内，所有洪水水位，都比这次的洪峰低一公寸到四公寸，但那次却崩了大、中型堤围四十八条，受淹农田一百多万亩。这次，由于有共产党和人民政府的领导，各堤围的农民在洪峰到来以前，几天内便把所有堤围加高了一公尺，洪峰到来后，又展开了顽强的抗洪斗争，因此，在保卫六百万亩良田的一百八十七条大、中型堤围中，只有南铁鼎一处溃堤，但全围居民无一死亡。
    现在，洪水对珠江三角洲堤围和北江、西江两岸堤围的压力虽然小了，但是绝大部分河道水位仍然很高，危险还未消除。
    据新华社南昌26日电  江西省赣南、吉安、九江等地区暴雨成灾，当地党政机关领导群众大力抗洪救灾。
    6月1日到20日，江西省大部地区先后下了四次暴雨。由于连降暴雨，山洪暴发，赣江和修水等江河水位暴涨。6月21日，赣江上游万安县棉津的水位达七十九点一六公尺，比历年有纪录的最高水位（1956年）高九公分。
    江西省各地在汛期以前都进行了比较充分的防汛准备工作，在洪水到来时更采取了许多紧急措施进行抢险，但是终因雨量过分集中，山洪暴发过急，部分地区造成了严重灾害。据不完全的统计，全省被淹农田二百多万亩。受灾最重的是赣南行政区石城、宁都、兴国、信丰，吉安专区的吉安、泰和、吉水、万安和九江专区的永修、武宁等县。
    目前赣南部分地区还在继续下雨。江西省有些河流的水位仍在上涨，赣江中下游丁家渡水文站25日水位超过警戒线。沿江、滨湖地的各县中共党委，已动员干部群众加紧作好防洪抢险的各项准备工作，保护堤防安全，防止水库倒塌，以避免损失，已经成灾地区的中共党委和各级干部，正在帮助灾区群众修理房屋、家具，解决耕牛、农具、衣被等生产和生活上的困难，并且充分发动群众及时做好洗苗、移苗、补苗和改种等工作，力争农作物的丰收，保证不荒一亩田。同时，江西省人民委员会已决定拨款三十七万元，及时救济赣南行政区和九江专区受灾人民。
