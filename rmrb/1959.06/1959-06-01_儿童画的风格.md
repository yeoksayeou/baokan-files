    The Style of Children's Paintings
    Zuo Hai
    Children are the future of mankind, our every hope. Our artistic life is undoubtedly entrusted to the children. Today, we have already seen that the young artistic lives of our descendants are shining even brighter than our own generation.
    Yesterday, I saw the National Children's Painting Exhibition jointly organized by the Central Ministry of Education, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the National Committee of the Chinese People's National Committee for Defence of Children, and the Chinese Artists Association. It displayed more than 360 paintings by 274 outstanding children from all over the country. I very much appreciated the natural beauty, the beauty of life, and the innocent childlike hearts reflected in these children's works. I believe that the artistic creation prospects of these child painters are infinitely vast, and their current works have already demonstrated their artistic genius.
    From these many works, we should see the new style of Chinese children's paintings. What are the characteristics of this style? In the works of each child painter, we can almost point out their different stylistic characteristics; however, generally speaking, all these paintings are not only children's paintings, expressing childlike innocence, but also unanimously expressing the common style of our era and nation. At a glance, these paintings are identifiable as Chinese children's paintings, and they all exude the breath of socialist life. Children have a keen ability to observe our social life today and everything around them that they encounter daily, and they also have a strong imagination. Our child painters rely on their direct observation, coupled with their imagination, to create boldly without restraint, so their works can so powerfully infect the audience. People cannot help but praise the artistic achievements of these works in unison.
    I cannot introduce all these child painters and their works. Here, I only intend to give some examples to illustrate the new style of Chinese children's paintings.
    A painting that catches the eye from afar is titled "How Happy the Goldfish Are." The painting depicts eight goldfish of different colors. The author uses the rendering method of Chinese painting to achieve a very prominent effect. The goldfish are lifelike, and the audience gets a strong sense of realism. The author of this painting is the Beijing child painter Huang Heiman, whom we are already familiar with. His works have participated in international exhibitions twice. The first time was in 1957, when he participated in the children's painting competition organized by the Indian Shankar's Weekly. At that time, he was only four years old, and the award-winning work was "Unbloomed Narcissus." The second time was in 1958, when he participated in the International Children's Art and Craft Exhibition organized by the British Daily Worker. At that time, he was five years old; in the hundreds of children's works from 31 countries, his two paintings, "Selling Watermelons" and "Carriage," were enthusiastically praised and won the first prize in the five-to-seven-year-old group. Now he is only six years old, and I think his painting of these goldfish is obviously much more advanced than his works from the previous two years.
    I remember when Chinese children's paintings participated in the competition organized by the Indian Shankar's Weekly in 1957 and the exhibition organized by the British Daily Worker in 1958, in addition to Huang Heiman's award-winning works, many other works also won good reviews from foreign public opinion. Other excellent paintings that participated in the Indian competition included Hong Dunpin's "Horse Racing" from Quanzhou, Fujian; Dong Dong's "Tiger" from Beijing; Guo Meizong's "Firecrackers and Flowers"; Li Geng's "Five Tiger Generals"; Li Zhu's "Drama Characters"; Sun Yuanyuan's "Self-Portrait"; Li Jinhe's "Rural Landscape Scroll"; Geng Fengwen's "Tibetan Dance" from Sichuan; Zhang Baoyuan's "Ode to June 1st" from Qingdao; and Chen Xianyao's "Roadside" from Shanghai. Those who participated in the exhibition organized by the British Daily Worker also included Li Geng's "Sun Wukong" from Beijing; Hong Dunpin's "Games in Kindergarten" and Huang Shilian's "River Boat" from Fujian. These three, like Huang Heiman, participated in the five-to-seven-year-old group. At the same time, Dong Dong's "Hunting" from Beijing was rated as the first place in the eight-to-ten-year-old group; Li Xiaoke's "Fleet of Boats" was rated as the second place in the eleven-to-thirteen-year-old group. Most of these child painters who have received good reviews internationally have new works exhibited in our National Children's Painting Exhibition this time, and their artistic level has obviously improved, which is a very gratifying phenomenon.
    Look, Li Geng's "Grape Festival" and "Watching Elephants" exhibited this time have bold and powerful lines, many characters, and complex expressions. Compared with his award-winning works abroad, his expressive techniques are more skilled, which is obvious at a glance. Hong Dunpin's new works "Flying Kites" and "Swatting Flies" depict the children's own lives and are more vivid than his previous works. What deserves our special attention is that more child painters have created more works, greatly enriching the garden of Chinese children's paintings.
    "We Go to Water the Flowers" by Dong Yisha, a five-year-old female child painter from Beijing, can be taken as an example. She draws willow trees with only a few strokes and clouds with only two light strokes, but the expressive power is very strong. What is the reason for this? I think this expression method mainly comes from the child's independent observation. On this basis, plus some traditional influences and appropriate enlightenment from adults, the children's own creative style will definitely be formed. We see that the hooks, wipes, dyes, and dots on the screen are not derived from copying, but from sketching, which is enough to show that our child painters are unconstrained in their creation. We must guide children to start with sketching, let children's own observation and imagination abilities be increasingly exercised, so that they dare to create boldly, and express themselves as they want based on the results of their observation of objective things. Only in this way can we cultivate children's creativity.
    "Playing with Pebbles," painted by Wang Mingsheng, an eight-year-old painter from Quanzhou, Fujian, has fifteen children distributed on a small screen, each with different expressions and actions, and the distance and size also conform to the principles of perspective. This is not because the little painter has learned perspective, but because it is the result of his careful observation of things. He meticulously but concisely outlines the spiritual outlook of each child playing with pebbles, which deeply attracts people. This is very successful.
    In addition to this direct observation and sketching method, we also see many children's paintings that obviously start with copying. For example, Wang Mingming, a seven-year-old painter from Beijing, is said to have copied Qi Baishi's paintings and learned some techniques of Chinese freehand brushwork. Therefore, when people see his "Spring Festival Temple Fair" and "Big Candied Haws," they immediately recognize that they were made by Qi Baishi's young disciple. Also, "Steel Marshal" by Guo Meizong, an eight-year-old painter, looks very much like a copy of an ancient painting. The skills learned from copying are often mastered relatively quickly. For child painters, with this kind of skill, and then going to sketch, they can also make good achievements. Jiang Xingyi, a nine-year-old child painter from Anhui, exhibited a painting entitled "Cutting Pigweed." The trees, rocks, weeds, and the faces and clothing patterns of the characters he painted can all be regarded as quite mature traditional Chinese painting methods. However, the content he paints has broken away from the traditional old subjects and expressed new themes. This shows that starting with copying is also a way. With such a foundation, if they continue to work hard to observe things, experience life, and not stay on the textbook, then we can believe that these little painters will reach a new creative realm and make greater achievements.
    Regardless of the different paths that the little painters take to create and learn, today their creative themes are full of the atmosphere of our era and express all aspects of life. They are remarkable, and their works are also remarkable. Today they are still very young, and we, the elders of the father and brother generation, have a full responsibility to strengthen the cultivation of the next generation, so that our child painters can grow up more healthily, and let Chinese children's paintings shine even brighter.

    儿童画的风格
    左海
    儿童是人类的未来，是我们的一切希望。我们的艺术生命无疑地也要寄托在儿童们的身上。今天，我们已经看到，我们的后辈子女幼小的艺术生命，比我们自己这一辈发出了更大的光辉。
    昨天，我看了中央教育部、共青团中央、中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会、中国美术家协会联合举办的全国儿童画展，这里陈列着全国各地二百七十四名优秀儿童的绘画作品三百六十多件。我非常满意地欣赏了这些儿童作品所反映的自然美、生活美和天真的童心。我认为这些儿童画家的艺术创作的前途是无限远大的，他们现在的作品已经表现了他们的艺术天才。
    从这许多作品中，我们应该看到我国儿童画的新风格。这种风格有些什么特点呢？在每一个儿童画家的作品中，几乎都可以指出他们各有不同的风格上的特点；然而，总的说来，所有这许多画不但都是儿童画，表现了儿童的天真，而且它们又都一致地表现出我们这个时代的和民族的共同风格。在这些画面上，一看就知道是中国的儿童画，而且都散发着社会主义的生活气息。孩子们对于我们今天的社会生活，对于他们日常接触的周围一切事物，具有敏锐的观察能力，同时又有很强烈的想像。我们的儿童画家正是依靠着他们的直接观察，加上自己的想像，没有拘束地大胆创作，所以他们的作品能够这样有力地感染了观众。人们不禁要异口同声地赞叹这些作品的艺术成就。
    我不能全部介绍这些儿童画家和他们的作品，这里只打算举出一些例子来说明中国儿童画的新风格。
    远远看过去就令人注目的一幅画，题目是“金鱼多么快乐”。画面上出现八条颜色不同的金鱼，作者运用中国画的渲染法有了很突出的效果，金鱼栩栩如生，观众得到强烈的实感。这幅画的作者是我们已经熟悉的北京儿童画家黄黑蛮。他的作品曾两次参加国际展览会。第一次是1957年参加印度香卡周刊举办的儿童画比赛，那时候他才四岁，得奖的作品是“没开花的水仙”。第二次是1958年参加英国工人日报举办的国际儿童美术工艺展览会，那时候他是五岁；在三十一国的几百件儿童作品中，他的两幅画，“卖西瓜”和“马车”，受到了热烈的赞扬，得到了五岁到七岁组的第一奖。现在他还只有六岁，我看他画的这一幅金鱼，比前两年的作品，显然又进步得多了。
    记得我国儿童画参加1957年印度香卡周刊举办的比赛，和参加1958年英国工人日报举办的展览会时，除了黄黑蛮的得奖作品以外，其他许多作品也都曾博得了外国舆论界的好评。参加印度比赛的还有福建泉州洪敦品的“赛马”、北京东东的“老虎”、郭玫宗的“爆竹和花”、李庚的“五虎将”、李珠的“戏剧人物”、孙元元的“自画像”、李进河的“农村景象长卷”、四川耿峰文的“西藏舞”、青岛张宝元的“六一颂”、上海陈显耀的“路旁”等许多优秀的图画。参加英国工人日报举办的展览会的，也还有北京李庚的“孙悟空”、福建洪敦品的“幼儿园里的游戏”、黄世连的“河船”。这三个和黄黑蛮一样是参加五岁到七岁组的。同时还有北京东东的“打猎”被评为八岁到十岁组的第一名；李小可的“群船”被评为十一岁到十三岁组的第二名。这些在国际上得到了好评的儿童画家，在我们这一次全国儿童画展中，多数都有新的作品展出，并且他们的艺术水平显然都有所提高，这是非常可喜的现象。
    看吧，这一次展出的李庚的“葡萄大会”和“看大象”，线条粗壮有力，人物众多而且表情复杂，比起他在国外两次得奖的作品来，在表现手法上更加熟练一些，这是一望而知的。洪敦品的新作“放风筝”和“打苍蝇”，描绘孩子们自己的生活，比他以前的作品也更加生动。尤其值得我们特别注意的是，有更多的儿童画家，画出了更多的作品，大大地丰富了我国儿童画的园地。
    北京的一个五岁的女儿童画家董一沙的作品“我们去浇花”，可以当作一个例子。她画柳树只有几笔，画云彩也只轻快地抹了两下，表现力却很强，这是什么缘故呢？我以为这种表现方法主要的是来源于孩子的独立观察。在这个基础上，再加某些传统的影响和成年人给予的适当启发，就一定会形成孩子们自己的创作风格。我们看见画面上的一勾、一擦、一染、一点，并不是从临摹得来的，而是从写生得来的，这就足以说明我们的儿童画家在创作上是无所拘束的。要引导儿童从写生入手，要让孩子自己的观察能力和想像能力得到越来越多的锻炼，使他们敢于大胆创作，根据对客观事物观察的结果，自己想要怎样表现就怎样表现，这样才能培养孩子们的创造性。
    福建泉州的八岁小画家王明圣画的“打石子”，有十五个孩子分布在一张小小的画面上，每个孩子的表情和动作各不相同，远近大小也符合于透视的原理。这并不是小画家已经学过透视学，而是他细心观察事物的结果。他一笔不苟地但是又很简洁地勾画了每个打石子的小孩的精神面貌，使人们深深地被吸引住了，这是很成功的。
    除了这种直接观察和写生的方法以外，我们也看到许多儿童画显然是由临摹入手的。例如，北京的一位七岁小画家王明明，听说曾临摹了齐白石的画，学了中国写意画的一些手法。因此，他画的“春节厂甸”、“大糖葫芦”等，让人一看便认得这是齐白石的小弟子所作的。还有，八岁小画家郭玫宗所作的“钢铁元帅”，很像是临摹古画来的。这些由临摹学到的技巧往往比较快就可以熟练起来。对于儿童画家来说，有了这种技巧，然后再去写生，同样可以作出很好的成绩。安徽有一位九岁的儿童画家江兴义，展出了一幅画，题为“打猪草”。他画的树木、石头、野草和人物的面部、衣纹等等，都可以算得是相当成熟的中国传统画法。他所画的内容却已经摆脱了传统的旧题目，而表现了新的主题。这就可见，从临摹入手也是一条路子。有了这样的基础，如果再努力去观察事物，体验生活，而不停留在粉本上，那末，我们可以相信，这些小画家一定会达到一个新的创作境地，做出更大的成就。
    不论小画家们创作学习的道路有哪些不同，但是，今天他们创作的主题却都充满着我们这个时代的气息，表现了生活的各个方面。他们是了不起的，他们的作品也是了不起的。今天他们的年纪还很小，我们做父兄的长辈人，完全有责任加强对后一辈的培养，让我国的儿童画家们更加健康地长成起来，让中国儿童画放出更大的光辉。（附图片）
