    After Settling Down
    ——Sketches of the Red October People's Commune in Nileke County
    By Our Correspondents Yang Kexian and Xia Ge'er
    The grasslands of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture are vast, stretching from Qinghe at the foot of the Altai Mountains in the east to Jimunai in the west, then turning south to Zhaosu County at the upper reaches of the Ili River. Tens of thousands of square kilometers of grassland would take months to traverse on horseback. Here we introduce an ordinary people's commune among the more than 140 in the prefecture.
    The Red October People's Commune is located in the Tianshan mountainous area between the Gongnais River and the Kashi River, with overlapping mountain ranges. The commune has 1,491 households of herdsmen, more than 90% of whom are Kazakhs. The commune owns millions of mu of natural seasonal pastures and 170,000 mu of arable land, grazing more than 70,000 head of livestock and cultivating more than 40,000 mu of land.
    New Villages and Towns on the Grassland
    We arrived at Halatubo, a settlement of the Red October People's Commune on the south side of the Kashi River. We saw houses lined up on the hillside, with crisscrossing streets, truly an emerging village and town on the grassland. In the village, Kazakh herdsmen were busy repairing farm tools and selecting seeds; women were also in groups carrying accumulated livestock and human manure from the courtyards of each household to the roadside, waiting to be transported.
    It is said that houses were built here as early as twenty years ago, but whenever the spring pastures arrived, the Kazakhs would leave and nomad to the sunny slopes to tend to the lambs. "The real settlement began after the liberation, during the cooperative movement, when herdsmen organized themselves to engage in large-scale agriculture," explained Elle Haz, deputy director of the commune. "Now, except for more than 500 households of livestock brigades who go out for seasonal nomadic grazing, nearly 1,000 households have settled down."
    New Miners Dig Wells for Coal
    For many years, the herdsmen of Halatubo cooked and brewed tea using cow and sheep dung as fuel. Who wouldn't look forward to the day when they could burn clean and hygienic smokeless coal! After the agricultural and livestock cooperative was established last year, the original ten agricultural and livestock cooperatives had, based on the demands of the vast number of agricultural and livestock workers, gone to the foot of the mountains to the north to look for coal. Because there were few people and they were scattered, the ten agricultural and livestock cooperatives searched separately for more than a month, but could not find a mine that could be exploited. It was not until after the establishment of the commune that everyone's strength was organized together, and a Uyghur miner, Tohu Tahong, with fifty years of mining experience, was invited to solve the problem.
    We entered the coal mine of the Red October Commune and saw thick smokeless coal all around, above, below, left, and right. More than thirty miners, under the light of their mine lamps, were draining water, digging coal, and then several young people took turns transporting large pieces of coal, weighing hundreds of pounds each, out of the mine.
    Old Hunter Shows His Prowess
    Not long after the commune was established, nineteen Kazakh and Mongolian sharpshooters were organized into a hunting team. Carrying guns, riding tall horses, and with golden eagles on their arms, they crossed two or three snow-capped mountains in the severe winter of minus twenty degrees Celsius and entered the virgin forests deep in the Tianshan Mountains to hunt. Because they knew that animal skins could support the country, increase commune income, and wild argali sheep could solve the problem of meat for commune members and reduce the consumption of domestic animals, the more they captured, the better.
    They camped in mountain rock caves, appearing in the forest and snowfields early and late, setting ambushes, tracking, and jointly encircling, enduring all kinds of hardships, and capturing all kinds of wild animals.
    Nura and Man, the thirty-year-old leader of the hunting team, is a brave Kazakh hunter. Everyone knows about his dangerous encounter in a hunt. That time, after he killed a male wolf, he went to chase a female wolf that had been injured by his iron trap. Unexpectedly, the ferocious and cunning female wolf circled behind a tree next to him. Startled, his first bullet grazed the wolf's ear and missed. The vicious wolf pounced from the front, and he hurriedly dodged behind the tree. This dodge happened to trap the vicious wolf with the iron trap between two large trees, unable to move forward or backward. After killing the wolf, Nura and Man tracked and pursued it, went deep into the wolf's den, and captured ten wolf cubs alive.
    In three months, the sharpshooters captured a total of 335 argali sheep, 21 big-horned mountain goats, and 54 foxes, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals.
    Shepherds Love Sheep Like Children
    After crossing the mountains, we reached the banks of the Gongnais River. Because this hillside faces the sun, the fresh and tender pasture has covered the hillsides like an boundless carpet. The more than 47,000 sheep of the Red October Commune, in groups of three to five hundred, fell on the grassland like stars. The more than 24,000 cattle and horses were near the river. The horses were rejoicing, the cattle were quietly eating grass, and the scene was completely different, opening up a refreshing atmosphere.
    This year's lambs in the Red October Commune are all hybrids improved with Xinjiang fine-wool sheep. Every herdsman is caring for the sheep like they are their own children. Before dawn every day, they go out to graze the sheep, and they do not return until late at night when the sheep are full. They also take turns guarding the sheep all night long, and they do not leave the sheep for a day, regardless of wind or rain. We visited the flock of Wali Bai, a national advanced agricultural producer, and found that the shepherds managed the lambs even more carefully. He grazed two hundred adult sheep, and nine of them had not yet given birth. The 191 adult sheep that had already given birth had produced 233 lambs. Not long ago, cadres from pastoral areas in the nine counties and one city directly under the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture held a field meeting here to promote their experience.

    定居以后
    ——尼勒克县红十月人民公社散记
    本报记者　杨克现　夏格尔
    伊犁哈萨克族自治州的草原是这样的广阔，东从阿尔泰山麓的青河，西到吉木乃，转折向南，直到伊犁河上源的昭苏县。几万平方公里的草原，够你骑马走上几个月。这里介绍的是全州一百四十多个人民公社中一个普通的人民公社。
    红十月人民公社位于巩乃斯河和喀什河之间山岭重叠的天山山区中。全公社一千四百九十一户牧民，百分之九十几都是哈萨克族人。公社拥有成百万亩天然四季牧场和十七万亩可耕土地，放牧着七万多头牲畜，种植了四万多亩土地。
    草原上的新村镇
    我们来到喀什河南面红十月人民公社的定居点哈拉土伯，只见山坡上房屋罗列、街衢交错，俨然是草原上一个新兴的村镇。村内哈萨克牧民正忙着修理农具，精选籽种；妇女们也成群结队地把家家户户院落中积存的畜粪人粪，抬到了马路旁边待运。
    据说早在二十年前就有人在这里盖上了房屋，可是每当春牧来临，哈萨克人就离开这里，游牧到向阳的山坡接羔。“真正的定居点，是在解放以后合作化运动中，牧民组织起来大量经营农业后开始的。”公社副主任艾勒哈孜向我们解释说：“现在除了畜牧业大队五百多户牧民外出四季游牧以外，其余将近一千户人家全都已经定居下来。”
    新矿工挖井取煤
    多少年来，哈拉土伯的牧民做饭煮茶，全用牛羊粪烧火，谁不盼望有一天能够烧到清洁卫生的无烟煤呢！去年农牧业合作化以后，原来十个农牧业社就曾经根据广大农牧民的要求，到北面山脚下找煤。因为人少分散，十个农牧业社分别找了一个多月，都没有找到可以开采的煤矿。直到公社成立以后，把大家的力量组织在一起，请来了一位有着五十年煤矿工龄的维吾尔矿工托乎他洪，才解决了这个问题。
    我们进入了红十月公社的煤井，只见上下左右全是厚不可测的无烟煤。三十多个矿工在矿灯光下，排水的排水，挖煤的挖煤，然后由几个年轻的人轮流着把一块块百十来斤重的大煤，运出了井口。
    老猎人大显威风
    公社刚刚成立不久，把十九名哈萨克族和蒙古族的神枪猎手组成了一支打猎队。他们背着枪、跨着高头大马，臂上架着狐鹰，在零下二十多度严寒的冬天，越过两三座雪山，进入天山深处原始森林里去狩猎。因为他们知道，兽皮可以支援国家，增加公社收入，野生黄羊可以给社员解决肉食，减少家畜的消耗，捕获的越多越好。
    他们在山上岩石洞中安营，早晚出没在林海雪原之中，预设埋伏，跟踪追击，合伙围剿，历尽艰苦，捕获各种各样的野生动物。
    三十来岁的猎队组长努拉和满是一位勇敢的哈萨克猎手。大家都知道他在一次打猎中的险遇。那次他打死了一只公狼后，又去追一只被他铁夹夹伤了的母狼，想不到那只凶恶狡猾的母狼绕到了他的身旁树后，他一惊之下，第一颗子弹擦伤了狼的耳朵，没有打中。恶狼从前面扑来，他急忙闪向树后，这一闪，恰好把那只带着铁夹的恶狼，因为铁夹而被两棵大树夹住，前后都不能动。打死了这只恶狼以后，努拉和满又跟踪追击，深入狼穴，生擒了十只小狼。
    在三个月内，神枪猎手共捕获了三百三十五只黄羊，二十一只大头山羊和五十四只狐狸、狼、獾等野兽。
    牧羊人爱羊如子
    翻过了大山就到了巩乃斯河畔，因为这面山坡向阳，鲜嫩的牧草像无边际的地毯已经铺上了山岗，红十月公社的四万七千多只羊，三五百一群，三五百一群，像繁星一般落在草原，两万四千多头牛马临近河边，马儿在欢腾，牛在静静地吃草，完全是另外一番令人心情开阔爽朗的场面。
    红十月公社今年的羔羊全部是用新疆细毛羊改良的杂种羔，个个牧民都怀着爱羊如子的心情，每天拂晓前他们就出去放羊，夜深人静等羊吃饱了才回来，通宵达旦还要轮流守夜，不管刮风下雨，一天也不离开羊群。我们参观了全国农业先进生产者瓦利拜的羊群，发现牧羊人对于羔羊管理得更加仔细，他放牧了二百只大羊，有九只还没有产羔，已产的一百九十一只大羊，共产了二百三十三只羔羊。不久以前，伊犁哈萨克族自治州直属九县一市的牧区干部，专门在这里召开了一次推广他们经验的现场会议。
