Rambling Talk on the "38th Parallel"
Yang Lüfang

Those who have seen the drama "On the 38th Parallel" performed by the People's Liberation Army Frontline Cultural Troupe will have a common feeling: Novel. This feeling stems primarily from the special struggle life on the 38th Parallel. The enemy and ourselves展开展开 a very sharp, complex, and special political, military, and diplomatic struggle on both sides of the line. Not many people have personally experienced this struggle, but people care about this kind of life. Therefore, when it appears on the stage, how can it not arouse the greatest interest from the audience?

Another reason why "On the 38th Parallel" is of interest is the tortuous and moving plot. At the beginning of the play, the news of the armistice agreement flew like a dove of peace. The志愿军 soldiers and the Korean people cheered together for the victory of peace, and the 志愿军 soldiers immediately began to help Aunt Cui rebuild her home. However, on the south side of the "38th Parallel," although the American-Li bandit gangs were forced to stop the war, they secretly created new war conspiracies. They sent batches of secret agents to sneak across the "38th Parallel" to carry out conspiracies and sabotage in the north, and steal military intelligence, but one by one they broke into the people's dragnet; however, the enemy was not willing to fail, and they sent a veteran agent, Qiao San, and another Korean youth, Cui Chunsheng, who had been raised by the Japanese intelligence agency for fifteen years, used various conspiracies and tricks to cross the "38th Parallel" to steal a secret document. When Qiao San and Cui Chunsheng were about to sneak back to South Korea, Aunt Cui discovered their suspicious behavior. Aunt Cui used a flashlight to report the situation and was stabbed by the two agents. At this time, the police guarding the peace rushed to arrest the cunning agents, and also captured the American agent, Thomas, who had crossed the border.

After Aunt Cui was stabbed by Cui Chunsheng, she recognized from a mole on his arm that this agent was her own son who had been lost for more than ten years; and Cui Chunsheng also knew that the old woman he had hurt was his own mother, and finally understood his sins.

Through such a tortuous plot, the fate of individuals, families, nations, and the country are linked together. People are not only concerned about the fate of 阿妈妮 individuals and families, but also more concerned about the anti-aggression struggle of the Chinese and Korean people represented by 阿妈妮.

"On the 38th Parallel" has achieved success in its performance. The actors are familiar with the struggle life in the play. Therefore, the performance is very realistic, can reflect the characters' thoughts and feelings, can grasp the movements full of national characteristics and personality traits, and can express the details of that special struggle life. All this is the main reason why this play can attract the audience, and it is also the main achievement of this play.

However, this play still has some shortcomings. First of all, the theme of this play is not prominent enough. Through this sharp and complex struggle, the audience should ultimately be told: The purpose of our struggle is for peace, and the purpose of the enemy's sabotage is for war. If, at the beginning of the play, the 志愿军 soldiers were helping the Korean people to rebuild their homes and engage in peaceful construction, then the contrast between one side desiring peace and the other side fantasizing about war would be more distinct, the purpose of the struggle would be clearer, and the theme would be more prominent.

Secondly, there are also some aspects of the characters that are worth studying. For example, Cui Chunsheng, a fierce professional agent, although born in the working class, has been politically degenerated after being raised by Japanese agents for fifteen years. How could such an inhuman, extremely reactionary agent suddenly be filled with maternal love in front of an unfamiliar old mother? How could such a person transform so quickly in thought and emotion all at once? This is somewhat unbelievable.

There are also some aspects of the plot that are not arranged reasonably enough. For example, why did Qiao San and Cui Chunsheng only wound Aunt Cui's shoulder when they assassinated her? Aunt Cui's first time coming out to fetch firewood had already aroused Qiao San's suspicion. The second time she came out to fetch firewood, she even carried a flashlight. Could Qiao San and Cui Chunsheng allow her to go out again? If the development of the plot cannot be fully believed, then it will destroy artistic authenticity.

Although "On the 38th Parallel" still has some shortcomings in its theme, character image, and plot, it has achieved certain achievements in terms of ideology and artistry. Therefore, the majority of the audience likes it relatively, and hopes that the author can further revise and improve it to make it more perfect and more moving.

    漫谈“三八线上”
    杨履方
    看了解放军火线文工团演出的话剧“三八线上”的人，都会有一个共同的感觉：新颖。这种感觉，首先由于在三八线上那种特殊的斗争生活。敌我双方在一条线的两边展开了非常尖锐、复杂和特殊的政治、军事、外交上的斗争。亲身经历过这种斗争的人并不多，然而，人们都关心这种生活，因此，当它出现在舞台上的时候，怎能不使观众感到最大的兴趣呢？
    “三八线上”使人感到兴趣的另一个原因，就是曲折动人的戏剧情节。戏一开始，停战协定的消息像和平鸽一样飞来，志愿军战士和朝鲜人民一起欢呼和平的胜利，志愿军战士们随即开始帮助朝鲜崔大娘重建家园。可是在“三八线”的南面，美李匪帮虽然被迫停战，但却又暗地里制造新的战争阴谋，他们派遣了一批批的特务偷越“三八线”，到北部来进行阴谋破坏，窃取军事情报，却一个个都闯进了人民的天罗地网；但是，敌人不甘心失败，他们又派遣了一个老牌特务乔三和另一个为日本特务机关豢养了十五年的朝鲜青年崔春生，使用了种种阴谋诡计，越过“三八线”，想窃取一项密件。当乔三和崔春生正要想潜回南朝鲜的时候，却被崔大娘发现了他们的可疑行迹，崔大娘用手电筒报告情况，被两个特务刺伤，这时，警卫着和平的民警们赶来抓住了狡猾的特务，同时也抓住了越境的美国特务汤姆斯。
    当崔大娘被崔春生刺伤以后，从他手臂上的一块黑痣认出来这个特务正是自己丢失了十几年的亲生儿子；而崔春生也知道自己所伤害的老大娘正是亲身的母亲，终于明白了自己的罪恶。
    通过这样曲折的戏剧情节，把个人、家庭、民族和国家的命运联系起来，人们不仅关心着阿妈妮个人和家庭的命运，同时，更关心着以阿妈妮为代表的中朝人民的反侵略斗争。
    “三八线上”在演出上是有成绩的。演员熟悉剧本中那种斗争生活，因此，在表演上非常真实，能体现人物的思想感情，能抓住富有民族色彩和性格特征的动作，能表现那种特殊斗争生活中的细节。这一切都是这个戏能吸引观众的主要原因，也是这个戏的主要成就。
    但是，这个戏仍有一些美中不足的地方。首先，这个戏的主题思想还不够突出。通过了这一场尖锐而复杂的斗争，最终应该告诉观众：我们斗争的目的，是为了和平，敌人破坏的目的，是为了战争。如果戏一开始，志愿军就在帮助朝鲜人民重建家园，从事和平建设，这样，一边是渴望和平，另一边是妄想战争，这样的对比越鲜明，斗争的目的就越明确，主题思想也就突出。
    其次，在人物形象上也有值得研究的地方，如像崔春生那样一个凶狠的职业特务，虽然出生于劳动阶层，但是，经过了日本特务十五年的豢养，在政治上已经变质了，这样一个灭绝人性、极端反动的特务，怎么能够在一个陌生的老妈妈面前，突然充满了母子感情？这种人，怎么能够那样迅速地在思想和感情上一下子就转变了呢？这是有些令人难以相信的。
    在情节上也还有一些安排得不够合理的地方，如乔三和崔春生刺杀阿妈妮，为什么仅仅刺伤了她的肩膀？阿妈妮第一次出来抱柴火，已经引起乔三的疑心，第二次又出来抱柴火，还带着电筒，乔三和崔春生还能容许她再出去么？如果情节的发展不能使人充分相信，那么，它就会破坏艺术真实。
    尽管“三八线上”在主题思想上、在人物形象上、在戏剧情节上还有一些缺点，但是在思想性上和艺术性上，是有一定成就的，因此，广大观众都比较喜欢它，也就希望作者能够进一步修改和提高，使它更加完美，更加动人。
