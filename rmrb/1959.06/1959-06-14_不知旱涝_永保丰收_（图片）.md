Korea to Increase Irrigated Area to One Million Jungbo in a Short Period; Water Conservancy Projects Like Stars Across All Regions

The Korean Workers' Party is leading farmers in a mass water conservancy construction movement and has already achieved brilliant results.

Currently, there are more than 10,000 water conservancy and irrigation projects, large and small, under construction in northern Korea. These include large-scale irrigation projects invested in by the state, as well as small reservoirs and small pumping stations built by agricultural cooperatives themselves. The water conservancy projects completed last winter and this spring can irrigate more than 377,000 jungbo (1 jungbo equals 15 mu) of land, which is more than three times the total irrigated area in northern Korea before liberation, and exceeds the total expanded irrigated area in the thirteen years after liberation (up to September last year). If the newly expanded area is added to the original, the total irrigated area in northern Korea this year will reach 800,000 jungbo.

The Korean Workers' Party has proposed to expand the irrigated area to one million jungbo within two or three years. Achieving this goal will make the entire northern Korea a place that "knows no drought or flood, forever guaranteeing a bumper harvest." On April 30, Korean Party and government leaders, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, attended the water release ceremony of the Kiyang Irrigation Project.

The Fanghyong Water Diversion in South Hwanghae Province is supplying water to 14,500 jungbo of dryland, and the farmers are overjoyed.
A "Korea-China Friendship" Youth Reservoir has been built in Chongju.

The first phase of Korea's largest irrigation project, the Kiyang Irrigation Project, has been completed. When the entire project is completed, it can irrigate 51,000 jungbo of land in six counties and one city, increasing grain production by about 300,000 tons. The wheat crop is about to have a bumper harvest. Now, North Pyongan Province is no longer afraid of drought.

    “不知旱涝  永保丰收”朝鲜短期内将把灌溉面积增至百万町步各个地区建立起星罗棋布的水利工程网
    朝鲜劳动党正在领导农民，开展群众性的兴修水利运动，并且已经获得辉煌的成绩。
    目前，朝鲜北部正在兴建的大小水利灌溉工程共一万多个。其中有国家投资兴建的大型灌溉工程，也有农业社自办的小水库、小抽水站。去冬今春，已经建成的水利工程，能灌溉三十七万七千多町步（每町步十五市亩）的土地，等于解放前朝鲜北部总灌溉面积三倍多，并且超过解放后十三年来（至去年9月）扩大的灌溉面积的总和。如果把新扩大的和原有的加在一起，今年朝鲜北部的总灌溉面积，将达到八十万町步。
    朝鲜劳动党提出，要在两、三年内把灌溉面积扩大到一百万町步。实现这个目标，整个朝鲜北部将成为“不知旱涝、永保丰收”的地方。4月30日，以金日成首相为首的朝鲜党政领导人参加歧阳灌溉工程放水典礼。
    黄海南道方衡引水处在向一万四千五百町步旱田供水，农民们心花怒放。定州建成了一个“朝中友好”青年水库
    朝鲜最大的灌溉工程——歧阳灌溉工程第一阶段工程已经完成。这个工程全部建成后可灌溉六个郡一个市的五万一千町步土地，增产约三十万吨粮食。小麦即将丰收。现在，平安道再也不怕旱了。
