Fly, Wings of Happiness
—A Visit to the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project Construction Site
By Our Correspondent Hai Bo

In a less than twenty square meter straw shed, there were two unpainted, crudely shaped rectangular tables and several long benches. A map painted with various colors hung on the wall in front of the tables. The tables were covered with rough porcelain teacups, and the room was filled with a pungent smell of tobacco. Clearly, a meeting had just adjourned. The chief commander of the project—a middle-aged man of medium build, with a dark red complexion, a thin face but bright eyes—led us into this simple and unadorned, yet bustling conference room. Before even sitting down, he jumped onto a stool, pointed at the map, and began to talk incessantly about the project's progress. Many people were familiar with the temperament of this provincial governor and chief commander. He came from a military background, having joined the Red Army at a young age, and fought countless battles, but he was not good at public speaking. There was only one exception—that was after winning a great victory. He seemed to be in that kind of mood today.

"What a wonderful place!" he said, pointing to the map with a smile. "This is a 175-meter-high concrete dam, comrades, 175 meters," he repeated. "Here, more than 20 billion cubic meters of water will be stored, and an inland sea of more than 1,000 square kilometers will be here." He ran his hand over the blue lines on the map that crisscrossed like a spider web. "These are irrigation canals. The disaster of the Han River will be eliminated, and more than 12 million mu of farmland can be irrigated. Some people say it can increase rice production by 7 billion jin. Let the mathematicians calculate exactly how much it can increase! And the installed capacity here is 900,000 kilowatts. Areas within several hundred kilometers can use the cheap electricity from here. And tourists can board large 500-ton ships from Hankou all the way to the foot of Wudang Mountain... Comrades, this is a huge and technically complex project. Our technical force is not large, but what does that matter? We are overcoming all difficulties to build it. Moreover, we want to build it at the fastest speed." He moved his hand to the dam's foundation: "Now, the right bank cofferdam has been completed, and the dam's foundation has begun to be poured. That is to say, the first victory of the project is already ours. I have fallen in love with this place!"

The chief commander became more and more energetic as he spoke, and his emotions became a little agitated. Sometimes he simply burst into loud laughter, laughing so loudly.

Only those who have seen the construction site can deeply understand why the chief commander's laughter was so loud.

What a magnificent scene it is! Steep mountain peaks have been leveled, turning into one large road after another. Cars shuttle back and forth. In the middle of the river stands a huge, thick, and wide cofferdam. Around the cofferdam are large water pump pipes, dense scaffolding, and brightly colored red flags mixed together. This is the famous right bank cofferdam. The turbulent and ferocious Han River has been forced by tens of thousands of laborers into less than a third of its original space, obediently flowing past. The other two-thirds of the riverbed has been enclosed by this iron barrel-like cofferdam and become a construction site. On this construction site, countless concrete mixers are making earth-shattering noises, countless people are pushing cement carts and rushing around, and tens of thousands of tons of cement are constantly being poured into the dam's foundation... The dam is growing visibly.

What is taking place here is a true battle between man and nature. It is a great war of strength and wit.

When the project started last September, there was nothing on the construction site, neither work sheds nor office buildings. The first group of personnel who arrived settled down after defeating a pack of leopards. Then, tens of thousands of farmers arrived, and there were very few skilled workers who knew what to do. According to the project design, to build a cofferdam in such a large project, thousands of tons of steel sheet piles must be used. Otherwise, starting work would be unimaginable. But at that time, let alone thousands of tons, even hundreds of tons of steel sheet piles were difficult to obtain... That was the situation. Should they wait to build the office buildings and work sheds first, repair the traffic on the construction site, train the required technical workers, produce the steel sheet piles... Prepare everything before starting work? In this way, not to mention the money involved, it would take several years. There was another way, which was to use the power and wisdom of the masses to overcome difficulties and get to work. The first method was good, but it was slow and required much more investment. The latter method was the opposite—fast, good, and economical, which everyone was satisfied with. According to the instructions of the superior party committee, the project headquarters and the broad masses adopted the latter method: hard work plus clever work to conquer nature. Without technical workers, they learned as they worked. Without steel sheet piles, the headquarters mobilized the masses to speak freely, summing up past small-scale water conservancy experience, and as a result, they found the method of "using earth to drive out water" to make the cofferdam (that is, first fill the river channel with earth, then dig out the earth in the middle, and the cofferdam is formed)... As a result, technical workers were trained, and more than 13,000 farmers became excellent concrete workers, with high work efficiency and good quality. The cofferdam made by the indigenous method withstood the test of three floods in the spring, and now it protects the safe construction of the project like an iron barrel... Man conquered nature, and wisdom conquered difficulties.

The chief commander said that he "fell in love with this place." In fact, everyone who participated in the construction of the project fell in love with it, and everyone who came to the Danjiangkou construction site would fall in love with it.

Danjiangkou is so beautiful! In the morning, the light red sunlight is particularly bright and gentle. The overlapping mountain peaks seem to be covered with a layer of soft gauze, which is picturesque and pleasant. The Han River is covered with a layer of slightly blue-red mist, and only a little shadow of the turbulent Han River remains. And whenever the sun sets in the west, the mountains are covered with a purple-red coat! The tall right bank cofferdam and the countless boats shuttling back and forth are reflected in the water.

The scenery of Danjiangkou is beautiful and lovely, and the people on the Danjiangkou construction site are even more beautiful and lovely.

Every morning, they get up with the sun, and then use their crisp songs and work calls to awaken the earth.

Now, in front of us are these lovely girls and lads.

This is a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl, tall, with big eyes, an exceptionally red face, and a strong body. She is unloading stones from the boat, quick-witted, energetic, and her work efficiency is more than twice as high as others. She is from Yun County, Hubei Province, and her name is He Guorong. When she heard about the Danjiangkou project, she signed up. Her family did not allow it, so she took the initiative—she came out first, and then wrote a letter to her family, and her father was forced to agree. She came to the construction site to do an ordinary job—a quarry worker. But she made this ordinary job so awe-inspiring. Last winter, on a bone-chilling day with icy river water, she and a group of people were quarrying stones in Anle River. Because the site was small, many newly mined stones "clattered" and rolled into the river. "How much money did the state spend, how much effort did we spend mining these stones? It's a pity to lose them!" The more she looked, the more heartbroken she became. As she watched, she jumped into the river. By the time everyone realized it, she had already picked up several stones.

From the outside, this girl seems rough and only knows how to work, but in fact, she is also a considerate girl! That was also last winter. Whether it was raining or snowing, the doors and windows of the work shed where He Guorong and several female companions lived had not been installed. One night, it was raining cats and dogs, and the cold wind was blowing into the house. Xiao Men, who was in the same room, was shivering from the cold. When He Guorong saw this, she quickly took off her clothes and put them on Xiao Men. When Xiao Men saw that He Guorong was wearing very little, she refused, saying, "You're cold too!" He Guorong patted her chest and said with a smile, "Are you afraid of freezing with my strength? The cold wind and rain will surrender here!" Everyone in the room was amused by her enthusiasm.

In another corner of the construction site, a group of lads were carrying soil. Among them was a young man in his twenties named Zhang Jicheng. He carried the soil in double baskets and walked with a trot. He worked hard during work hours and did not idle after work. One night, the right bank cofferdam protecting the project was in danger. Everyone was sound asleep, but Zhang Jicheng discovered this serious situation during his patrol and immediately took the risk to join the rescue until the cofferdam was saved.

When describing the strong sense of responsibility of some people, people often say, "He cherishes his career as much as he cherishes his life." But the people on the Danjiangkou construction site are willing to use their lives to protect their careers. At the end of March, the Han River experienced a peach blossom flood peak that had not been seen in decades, rising more than three meters in one day and night. The right bank cofferdam protecting the project, which had just been completed, had a serious accident. A section in the middle collapsed for dozens of meters and was collapsing more and more.

At that critical moment, a battle cry was raised: "The people are here, the cofferdam is here!" Then, a fierce battle unfolded on the construction site. The water kept rising, the cofferdam kept sinking, and the people kept coming up. From the chief commander to the cooks, everyone came up. They felt for leaks, blocked floods, one was not enough, then two, two were not enough, then three, three were not enough, then five...; There were not enough rescue materials, so people took out everything they could. After a whole three days and three nights of fierce fighting, the people of Danjiangkou finally won. The embankment was there, and the people were there.

The people on the Danjiangkou construction site have the courage of ten thousand men and the wisdom that Zhuge Liang could not match. Because they are people with ideals.

When Zhang Jicheng persuaded his mother to let him come to the construction site, he looked at his mother's kind face and said, "Mom, have you forgotten? The flood forced our whole family to flee. Dad was beaten to death by the bully three months before I was born. On the third day after I was born, you took us to beg for food, and my brother starved to death... It was the Communist Party that saved our family's life, and life began to get better. But after the Danjiangkou project is completed, life will be even better! At that time, there will be no more floods, and the country will be stronger. Have you ever seen an electric light? No. There will be one then. That kind of light doesn't need matches to light up, and it's much brighter than an oil lamp. Have you ever seen an electric plow plowing the fields? No. You'll see it then too. Have you seen an electric machine washing clothes? No. At that time... Look, isn't this our own business?" He made his mother laugh. That's how he came to the construction site.

Yes, young people, let your dreamlike ideals fly high! Spread your wings of happiness and fly as hard as you can! In our country, there is a free and vast sky, a great and strong helmsman, infinitely hardworking and brave people, and the red thoughts given to you by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Happiness will come before your eyes, and you will fly to the paradise of happiness!

(Note) The full name of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project construction site should be: Danjiangkou Hanjiang Water Conservancy Hub Project construction site. The Dan River flows into the Han River here, and the project is being done on the Han River, but this is the entrance of the Dan River. For convenience and to be distinctive, people simply refer to this as the Danjiangkou Project construction site. (Attached picture)
The foundation clearing work for the right bank cofferdam of the Danjiangkou Hanjiang Water Conservancy Hub Project has been completed, and now the workers are pouring cement to build the dam foundation.

    飞吧  幸福的翅膀
    ——访丹江口水利工程工地
    本报记者　海波
    在一间不到二十平方公尺的草棚子里，摆着两张没有油漆的外形粗糙的长方桌子和几条长条凳子，桌子前面的墙上挂着一幅涂有各种颜色的地图。桌子上放满了一些粗瓷茶杯，屋子里还弥漫着刺鼻的烟草味，显然，会议是刚刚散了。工程总指挥长——一位中等身材，脸色黑红，面孔瘦削但眼睛炯炯有神的中年人，把我们领进这个简单朴素、热气腾腾的会议室，还没坐下，他就跳到凳子上，手指着地图，滔滔不绝地讲起工程情况来了。很多人熟悉这位省长兼总指挥长的脾气。他是军人出身，从小就当红军，打了不知多少仗，但不善于讲话。只有一种情况例外——那就是打了很大的胜仗以后。今天的样子，很像是那个时候。
    “多么美好的地方啊！”他指着地图笑着说：“这是一道一百七十五公尺高的混凝土大坝，同志们，一百七十五公尺。”他重复了一句。“这里将蓄水二百多亿立方公尺，一千多平方公里的内海就在这里。”他又用手在地图上那些纵横交错像蜘蛛网似的蓝色线条上划了几划：“这是灌溉渠道，汉江的灾难消灭了，还能灌田一千二百多万亩，有人说能增产七十亿斤稻谷，到底能增产多少，让数学家去算吧！而这里的装机容量是九十万瓩，几百公里以内的地区都可以用到这里廉价的电；而游人们可以坐上五百多吨的大轮船从汉口一直到武当山脚下……同志们，这是一个规模巨大、技术复杂的工程，我们的技术力量不多，但这算什么呢，我们正在克服一切困难建设它。而且，我们还想用最快的速度来建成它。”他又把手移到大坝坝基那里：“现在，右岸围堰已经作好了，大坝基础已经开始浇灌了，也就是说，工程的第一个胜利已是我们的了。我爱上了这里啦！”
    总指挥长越说越有劲，情绪有点激动了。有时简直是哈哈大笑，笑得是那样响亮。
    只有看到施工现场的人们，才能深刻理解到总指挥长的笑声为什么那样响亮。
    这是一个多末宏伟的场面啊！险峻的山峰被削平了，变成了一条又一条的大路，汽车往来如梭，河的中间屹立着一道又厚又宽的巨大围墙，围墙周围粗大的抽水机管子，密密层层的脚手架和鲜艳夺目的红旗混在一块，这就是著名的右岸围堰。白浪滔滔、凶暴成性的汉江，已被几万劳动大军逼在不到三分之一的地方，乖乖地流过去了，另外的三分之二的河床，已被这个铁桶一般的围堰围住，成为施工场地了。在这工地上，无数混凝土搅拌机，发出震天巨响，无数人推着水泥斗车在飞奔着，成万吨水泥不断地向大坝坝基倾注……，大坝眼看就成长起来了。
    这里进行的是一场真正的人同自然搏斗的战争。是一场斗力和斗智的大战。
    当去年9月工程开始的时候，工地上什么也没有，既没有工棚，也没有办公大楼，第一批到达的人员还是在战胜了一群豹子之后定居下来的。接着，开来了成万的农民，懂行的熟练工人很少；按照工程设计，在这样大的工程中作围堰，必须用几千吨钢板桩，否则要开工是不可想像的，但是当时不要说几千吨，就是几百吨钢板桩也是困难的……情况就是这样。等着把办公大楼和工棚先盖起来，把工地交通全修好，把所需要的技术工人训练出来，把钢板桩生产出来……把一切都准备好再动工吗？这样，花钱不要说，时间要等上几年；另外还有一条路，就是用群众的力量和智慧战胜困难，干起来。前面一种办法好是好，但是时间要来得慢，投资要大得多；后一种方法则相反——又快又好又省，大家满意。根据上级党委的指示，工程总指挥部和广大群众采取了后一种办法：苦干加巧干，战胜大自然。没有技术工人，边干边学，没有钢板桩，指挥部发动群众鸣放，总结过去小型水利经验，结果找到了“以土赶水”作围堰的方法（即先将土填没河槽，再把中间的土挖开，围堰就成了）……结果，技术工人训练成了，一万三千多个农民变成了好样的混凝土工，工作效率高质量好；土法作的围堰，经过了春天三次洪水的考验，现在像铁桶一样保护着工程的安全施工……人战胜了自然，智慧战胜了困难。
    工程总指挥长说他“爱上了这个地方”，其实，所有参加工程建设的人都爱上这里了，而且，凡是来到丹江口工地的人都会爱上这里的。
    丹江口是这样美丽哟！早晨，淡红色的阳光特别鲜艳温柔，重叠的山峰，像披上了一层柔软的轻纱，清秀宜人；汉江罩着一层微蓝透红的薄雾，奔腾的汉江只留下一点点影子。而每当夕阳西下的时候，群山则披上一层紫红色的外衣！高大的右岸围堰和无数往来如织的帆船的倒影在水中荡漾。
    丹江口的景色美丽可爱，丹江工地上的人比这更美丽更可爱。
    每当清早，他（她）们和太阳一块起来，然后，用清脆的歌声和劳动号子唤醒大地。
    现在，在我们面前的就是这些使人见了就爱的姑娘们和小伙子们。
    这是一位十七、八岁的姑娘，高个儿，大眼睛，脸蛋格外红，身子结实，她正在从船上向下卸石子，眼明手快劲头大，工效比别人高一倍多。她是湖北省郧县人，名字叫何国荣。听说修丹江口工程，就报了名，家里不让，她来了个先斩后奏——先出来，再给家里写了信，父亲被迫同意了。她来工地干的是件平凡的工作——一名采石工。可是她把这个平凡的工作作得使人惊心动魄。去年冬天，一个冷风刺骨、河水冰人的日子，她们一帮人在安乐河采石子，由于场地小，许多新采下的石子“哗啦哗啦”滚到河里去了。“国家花多少钱，我们花多少力采的石子，丢了多可惜啊！”她越看越心痛。看着看着，一跃跳到河里去了。当大家发觉的时候，她已经捞起几块石头。
    从外表看起来，这个姑娘粗里粗气只知干活，其实，她还是个会体贴人的姑娘哩！那也是在去年冬天，不是下雨就是下雪，何国荣和几个女伴住的工棚门窗还没安上。一天晚上，大雨倾盆，冷风一个劲地往屋里钻，同屋的小姑娘门正文冻的哆嗦，何国荣一看，连忙把自己的衣服脱下，给小门披上，小门见何国荣穿的很少，硬是不要，说：“你也冷呀！”何国荣拍拍胸脯笑着说：“看我这结实劲怕冻吗？冷风冷雨在我这里也要投降！”全屋的人一下就被她这热劲逗笑了。
    在工地的另一角，一帮小伙子正在挑土。其中有个二十多岁的小伙子名叫张吉成。挑土是双担，走路是小跑。上班时猛干，下班也不闲着。一天夜晚，保护工程施工的右岸围堰出险了，人们都睡熟了，张吉成在巡回中发现了这个严重情况，马上冒险投入了抢救，直到保住了围堰为止。
    有人在形容某些人的责任心强时，往往这样说：“他爱护自己的事业就像爱护自己的生命一样。”但丹江口工地的人们肯于用自己的生命来保护自己的事业。3月末，汉江出现了几十年以来未遇见的桃汛洪峰，一天一夜之间就涨了三公尺多。保护工程施工的、刚刚做好的右岸围堰发生了严重险情，中间一段塌陷了几十公尺，而且越垮越大。
    正当千钧一发的时刻，一个战斗的口号提出来了：“人在围堰在”，接着，工地上展开了一场险恶的战斗。水一个劲往上涨，围堰一个劲往下陷，人，一个劲往上上，从总指挥长到炊事员，全上来了，他们摸漏洞，挡洪水，一个不行两个，两个不行三个，三个不行五个……；抢险器材不够，人们把能拿到的一切都拿出来了。整整酣战了三天三夜，丹江口的人们终于胜利了，堤在，人也在。
    丹江口工地上的人们有万夫不当之勇，有孔明不及之智。因为他（她）们是些有理想的人。
    张吉成在劝说母亲让他来到工地的时候，望着妈妈的慈祥面孔这样说：“妈妈，你忘记了吗？水灾逼得我们全家逃难，爹在我生下三个月前就被恶霸打死了，你在生下我第三天就领着我们去讨饭，哥哥饿死了……。共产党来了才救了我们一家人的命，生活开始过好了。可是丹江口工程修好后，生活会更好呢！那时水灾没有了，国家会更强大。你看见过电灯吗？没有。那时会有的，那种灯点起来不用火柴，比油灯亮得多。你见过电犁耕田吗？没有。那时也会看到的。你看见用电器机洗衣服吗？没有。那时……你看，这不是自己的事吗？”他把母亲说笑了。他就这样来到了工地。
    是的，年青的人们，让你们美丽得像梦一样的理想高高飞翔吧！展开你们幸福的翅膀尽力飞吧！在我们的国家里，有自由而辽阔的天空，有伟大而坚强的舵手，有无限勤劳勇敢的人民和共产党毛主席给你们的红色的思想，幸福会到你们眼前，你们会飞到幸福的乐园！
                            1959、5、25
    （注）丹江口水利工程工地的全称应是：丹江口汉江水利枢纽工程工地。丹江在这里流入汉江，工程是做在汉江上的，但这里是丹江入口处，为了方便和有特点起见，所以人们都简称这里是丹江口工程工地。（附图片）
    丹江口汉江水利枢纽工程右岸围堰的大坝清基工作已经作好，现在工人们正在用水泥浇灌大坝基础。
