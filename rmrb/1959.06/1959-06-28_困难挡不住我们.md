Difficulties Cannot Stop Us
By our correspondent Zhou Yongkang

Batch after batch of penicillin and streptomycin are being shipped from the Shanghai Third Pharmaceutical Factory to all parts of the country. Seeing these batches of medicines leaving the factory, people cannot help but think of how many people will be relieved of their suffering and restored to health! It has been more than eight years since China's first factory producing antibiotic raw materials was built, and the output of antibiotics has been increasing year by year. This year's plan will increase production enough to manufacture forty to fifty million more vials of medicine than last year. The rapid increase in production has brought many difficulties to the factory, but the workers proudly say: No matter how great the difficulties, they cannot stop our determination to increase drug production.

The Hearts of Veteran Workers

Last summer was the fifth expansion of the Shanghai Third Pharmaceutical Factory since its establishment. Most of the equipment needed for this expansion could be manufactured domestically, except for the high-speed centrifuge used in the refining section. This centrifuge needed to rotate at 6,000 revolutions per minute, and many parts had to be made of stainless steel. Not only had it never been made domestically, but it was also difficult to import at the time. The leadership entrusted the problem to the masses to find a solution. At this time, Fang Xinggen, a veteran worker who had been working here since the first day the factory opened, said: "In the past, we couldn't manufacture many kinds of equipment, but now we can make everything. Are we still afraid of making a centrifuge?" The leadership encouraged the workers to do it themselves. Fang Xinggen and others made the first one based on the existing centrifuge style in the factory, but it was destroyed during the test run. Some people's confidence wavered a bit. But Master Fang became even more enthusiastic. He discussed with everyone every day to improve the design of the second centrifuge. The important part of the centrifuge—the butterfly valve—required very high precision. This time, in order to ensure quality, it was entirely made of stainless steel. However, stainless steel is hard and brittle, and it breaks when rolled. Fang Xinggen didn't care about rest and went everywhere to learn annealing techniques. Later, a solution was found. The factory didn't have an annealing furnace, so he built a simple earth furnace himself, controlled the temperature with his many years of experience, and patiently annealed each piece. It took him more than two months to roll all fifty butterfly valves. When entrusting an outside factory to process the large parts of the centrifuge shell, he was even more worried. At this time, the weather was very cold, so he took a cotton coat and simply lived there, staying close day and night, carefully checking every process. The centrifuge shell was finally made, and the quality fully met the requirements. This centrifuge was finally put into production at the end of March with the joint efforts of everyone.

Racing Against Time

Refining antibiotics requires a centrifuge, but it also requires organic solvents such as butanol and butyl acetate. These raw materials used to rely on support from various regions, but at the end of last year, due to the widespread development of antibiotic factories, the raw materials became increasingly scarce. What method could be used to produce antibiotics without using organic solvents? Several young technicians in the laboratory heard that the Soviet Union had a kind of ion exchange resin that could replace organic solvents, but after inquiring, they found that this resin had only recently been successfully researched in China, the quantity was extremely small, and the basic raw materials used were imported, making it a case of "distant water cannot quench a fire." Technician Zhang Jiabao and others decided to first find a way out among the existing resin raw materials in China. Finally, they found a styrene resin that could be supplied in large quantities domestically, which could not only solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, but also reduce the cost by four-fifths. This method was successful in the laboratory, but to use it in production, it had to undergo a pilot test. The three exchange towers needed for the pilot test had not been built yet due to a shortage of steel plates at the time. Some people advocated waiting for the exchange towers to arrive before continuing the test, but Zhang Jiabao said that time waits for no one and we must race against time. He saw that after the phosphoric acid bought by the supply and marketing department was used up, there were still many empty bottles that were not being used, so he took them and connected two glass tubes to replace the exchange towers. At the beginning, the recovery rate of terramycin was only about 20%. Those who did not approve of the immediate test said: I knew this method wouldn't work. However, Zhang Jiabao believed: Since terramycin units can be recovered, it means that this method is still useful. Then, he and the workers operated together and found the reasons such as excessive use of caustic soda, and the recovery rate immediately increased to about 60%. Moreover, during this test, they had already produced more than 3,000 bottles of terramycin. The factory is now applying the exchange resin they trial-produced to larger-scale production, preparing to expand the production of various antibiotics.

Every Little Bit is Precious

In late March, the factory held a workers' representative meeting and specially invited the pharmacy director of a hospital. He said at the meeting: Only 0.8 cm of chlortetracycline can save the life of a child suffering from measles, which means that one kilogram of chlortetracycline can restore the health of more than a thousand children. This sentence caused a great shock among the workers, who said, we still have a lot of waste in production, how many 0.8 centimeters are there in this! The Jin Zhifa team of the refining section returned to the workshop and the entire team began to look for signs of waste and reduce losses. Some workers saw that after the filter cloth was used, they would scrape it slightly and then rinse it with water, and many chlortetracycline units on it were also washed away. Now, after scraping it, they put the cloth on an infrared lamp to dry it, and then rub the chlortetracycline on it little by little; some people dug out the residue in the corners of pipes and machines and re-crystallized it... In a month and a half, this team recovered more than four kilograms of chlortetracycline.

This matter quickly spread in the workshop, and the other five refining teams also tried every means to reduce waste. Before recovering waste liquid, they first precipitated it to extract the chlortetracycline units, and then let the waste liquid flow into the drain, which can also recover 100 centimeters of chlortetracycline every day. As a result of everyone in the entire workshop paying attention to saving, more than 10,000 bottles of chlortetracycline medicine can be produced in a year without increasing any raw materials.

    困难挡不住我们
    本报记者　周永康
    一批又一批的青霉素和金霉素，正从上海第三制药厂源源运往全国各地。人们看到这一批批药品出厂，谁都会想到，这又将使多少人摆脱病患的痛苦，重新恢复健康啊！我国这个第一个生产抗菌素原料药的工厂建成，已有八年多了，抗菌素的产量一年比一年多。今年的计划比去年增长的部分就可以用来制造四五千万瓶药品。产量的突飞猛进给这个厂带来不少困难，可是工人们却自豪地说：再大的困难，也挡不住我们增产药品的决心。
    老工人的心
    去年夏天，是上海第三制药厂开始建厂以来的第五次扩建，这次扩建所需要的设备，绝大部分国内都能制造，唯有提炼工段用的高速离心机无法解决。这种离心机每分钟要转到六千转，并且有许多部件是要用不锈钢制造，不仅国内从未做过，当时进口也有困难。领导上把这个问题交给群众来想办法。这时候，从开厂第一天起就在这里工作的老工人方兴根说：“过去我们有许多设备不会制造，现在样样都会做了，难道一个离心机还怕造不出来？”领导上鼓励职工们自己动手干，方兴根和大家根据厂里现有离心机的式样制成了第一台，可是一试车就毁坏了。有些人信心有点动摇。可是方师傅干劲更大了。他天天和大家一起商量改进第二台离心机的设计。离心机上的重要部件——蝶片精密度很高，这次为了保证质量，全部改用不锈钢。但是不锈钢性质硬脆，一轧就碎。方兴根顾不得休息，到处奔走讨教退火技术。后来办法找到了，厂里没有退火炉，他自己又造了一个土炉子，凭他多年的经验控制温度，耐心地退一道轧一道，五十片蝶片足足花了两个多月的时间才全部轧成。在委托外厂加工离心机外壳大件时，他更是放心不下。这时，天气很冷，他挟了件棉大衣，干脆就住在那里，日夜寸步不离，每道工序都仔细检查。离心机外壳终于制成了，质量完全符合要求。这台离心机在大家共同努力下，终于在3月底投入生产。
    抢在时间前面
    提炼抗菌素需要离心机，但还要用丁醇、醋酸丁酯等有机溶媒。这些原料，过去一直依靠各地支援，去年年底，由于抗菌素工厂遍地开花，原料就日益减少。采用什么方法，不用有机溶媒来生产抗菌素呢？试验室里几个青年技术员，听说苏联有一种离子交换树脂，可以代替有机溶媒，但一打听，这种树脂国内才研究成功，数量极少，而且用的基本原料是进口的，远水救不了近火。技术员张嘉宝等决定先在国内已有的树脂原料中找出路，最后找到了一种国内能大量供应的苯乙烯树脂，不但可以解决原料不足的困难，成本也可以降低六分之五。这种方法在试验室里是成功了，要用到生产上去，还得经过中型试验。中型试验要用的三个交换塔，因为当时缺少钢板，还没有造好。有些人主张，等交换塔来了以后再继续试验，可是张嘉宝说，时间不等人，一定要抢在时间前面。他看到供销科买来的磷酸用完后，还有许多空瓶没有用处，就拿来通进两个玻璃管代替交换塔。开始时，土霉素的收得率只有20％左右，那些不赞成马上就试验的人就说：我早知道这办法行不通。张嘉宝却认为：既然能够收到土霉素单位，就说明这办法还是有用。接着，他和工人们一起操作，找出了烧碱用量过多等原因，收得率马上提高到60％左右。而且在这个试验过程中，他们已经生产了三千多瓶土霉素。厂里现在正在把他们试制的交换树脂，应用到更大量的生产上去，准备扩大生产各种抗菌素。
    点滴是宝
    3月下旬，厂里召开职工代表大会，特地请来了一家医院的药房主任。他在会上说：只要零点八公分的金霉素就可以挽救一个患麻疹孩子的生命，也就是说，一公斤的金霉素能够使一千多个儿童恢复健康。这句话在工人中引起了很大的震动，工人们说，我们生产上浪费还不少，这里面可有着多少个零点八公分呀！提炼工段金志发小组回到车间就全组动手寻找浪费苗子，减少流失。有的工人看到过滤布用了以后，稍稍刮一刮就用水冲洗，上面还有不少金霉素单位也被冲走了，他们现在刮过以后，再把布放在红外线上烘干，然后把上面的金霉素一点一点地搓下来；有的人把管道、机器角落里的残渣挖出来，重新进行结晶……。在一个半月内，这一个小组竟回收到四公斤多金霉素。
    这件事情很快就在车间里传了开来，其他五个提炼小组也都千方百计地减少浪费。他们在废液回收前，先经过沉淀，把金霉素单位取出来，然后再让废液流进阴沟，每天也能回收一百公分金霉素。整个车间人人注意节约的结果，在不增加一点原料的情况下，一年就可以增产一万多瓶金霉素药品。
