    Cultivating a New Generation of Red Doctors
    Shanghai First Medical College Strengthens Teaching of Basic Courses

    (Our dispatch) Shanghai First Medical College, in its effort to improve teaching quality, attaches great importance to the teaching of basic medical courses and arranges ample practical opportunities in various disciplines for students to cultivate their independent working and scientific research abilities. Through summarizing the experience of implementing the Party's education policy, and based on the characteristics of medical science, the school believes that to cultivate students into a new generation of red doctors, it is necessary to correctly understand the relationship between theory and practice and to strengthen the teaching of basic medical knowledge.

    Currently, Shanghai First Medical College offers thirty-one courses, fifteen of which are basic medical courses that lay the foundation for learning clinical skills, accounting for 55% of the total study time. All classroom lectures in these courses are given by professors and lecturers. In addition to writing teaching materials, the lecturers also prepare lesson plans and lecture notes. Many teaching and research groups also have a trial lecture system. The spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is implemented for academic issues, and students are introduced to various schools of thought. For example, in physiology, in addition to teaching Pavlov's theory, various Eastern and Western theories are also introduced, explaining their similarities, differences, and values to give students a clear concept. The teaching of pathology, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and other subjects that study the laws of disease occurrence and development also emphasizes experimentation. The teaching and research groups of these disciplines have preserved hundreds of thousands of pathological data and cadaver specimens accumulated over the past ten years, allowing each student to do experiments themselves and write reports under the guidance of teachers, or conduct classroom discussions, to master solid theoretical knowledge. To enable students to read various modern medical academic materials, foreign language study time has been increased in the newly revised teaching plan, and students in each department must master one foreign language and also take a second foreign language course. The latest achievements in modern world medicine are now incorporated into the teaching materials, and a large amount of practical Chinese material is also added. For example, the newly established course in radiological medicine has compiled teaching materials such as "The Application of Isotopes in Clinical Practice" and "Radiation Protection Issues," many of which are accompanied by examples of hospital diagnosis and treatment. Environmental hygiene has also added issues such as rural people's commune health planning. In 1958, various teaching and research groups successively revised and compiled more than two hundred new teaching materials and teaching syllabuses, many of which have been adopted by some medical colleges.

    To cultivate students' independent working abilities, from the first academic year, students must conscientiously complete various internship assignments and technical training. Third- and fourth-year students study clinical courses, and from the fourth year, they go to the six hospitals affiliated with the medical college to practice clinical demonstrations and "concentrated rotation," learning clinical theoretical knowledge while becoming familiar with the actual medical work of the hospital. Starting this year, fifth-year students will also go to grassroots hospitals in factories or rural areas for two months of graduation internship, directly contacting patients and learning to diagnose, write medical records, and do clinical tests under the guidance of hospital doctors, to cultivate their independent clinical analysis abilities.

    Currently, the school has formulated a labor education syllabus as part of the teaching plan, based on the experience of going to the countryside and factories for labor training last year and connecting with reality. The teachers have compiled fourteen volumes of teaching materials suitable for teaching in labor, based on their experience of participating in mass health work and many specific examples. Now, some teaching and research groups have formed business guidance groups when going to the grassroots to participate in mass health work to provide specific guidance to students so that labor is combined with learning and scientific research. The students who participated in the elimination of schistosomiasis in Qingpu County have written more than fifty scientific papers in the past six months because they attended classes, treated diseases, and conducted scientific research at the same time, which greatly improved and trained their scientific analysis abilities.

    培养新一代的红色医生
    上海第一医学院加强基础课的教学工作
    本报讯　上海第一医学院在提高教学质量中，十分注重基础医学课程的教学工作，并且为学生安排了各种学科的充分的实践机会，培养他们独立工作和科学研究的能力。学校通过总结贯彻执行党的教育方针的经验，根据医学科学的特点，认为把学生培养成为新一代的红色医生，必须正确了解理论与实践的关系，对于基础医学知识的教学工作必须加强。
    目前，上海第一医学院开设各种课程三十一门，其中为打好学习临床技术根基的基础医学课程有十五门，占学习总时数的55％。这些课程的课堂讲授全部由教授、讲师担任。讲课教师除了编写讲义以外，都写出教案和讲稿，许多教研组还有试讲制度。对于学术问题贯彻百家争鸣的精神，向学生介绍各种不同学派的学说，像生理学，除了向学生讲授巴甫洛夫学说外，也介绍东西方的各种学说，分别说明他们的异同及其价值，给学生以明确的概念。研究疾病发生发展规律的病理学、解剖学、生理学、生物化学等教学还注意做实验。这些学科的教研组保存有十多年来积累下来的几十万例的病理资料以及尸体标本等实物，使每个学生都能亲自动手做实验，并且在教师指导下写出报告，或者进行课堂讨论，掌握牢固的理论基础知识。为使学生阅读各种现代的医学学术资料，在新修订的教学计划中，增加了外文学习时间，各系的学生除了必须掌握一种外国语以外，还要选修第二种外国语课程。对于近代世界医学上的最新成就，现在也都编入教材中，并且充实了大量的中国实际材料。像今年新设的放射医学课所编的教材
  “同位素在临床上的应用”、“放射线防护问题”等，其中有许多附有医院诊断和治疗的实例。环境卫生学也增加了人民公社卫生规划等问题。在1958年各教研组已先后修订、编写了新教材和教学大纲二百多种，其中许多教材已被一些医学院采用。
    为了培养学生独立工作能力，从第一学年起，学生就要认真完成各种实习作业和技术训练。三、四年级学生学习临床课程，从四年级开始到医学院所属的六个医院去，采用临床示教和“集中轮回”的办法实习，一边学习临床理论知识，一边熟悉医院的医疗工作实际情况。从今年开始，五年级学生还要到工厂或农村的基层医院去进行两个月的毕业实习，直接接触病人，在医院的医师指导下，学会诊断、写病历、做临床化验等，培养他们具备独立的临床分析能力。
    目前，学校根据去年下乡下厂进行劳动锻炼联系实际的经验，已制订了劳动教育大纲，作为教学计划的一部分。教师们已根据他们参加群众卫生工作的经验和许多具体事例，编写了十四册适合于在劳动中教学的教材。现在有些教研组在下基层参加群众卫生工作时，组成了业务指导组，对学生进行具体指导，使劳动与学习、科学研究结合起来。在青浦县参加消灭血吸虫病的学生，由于一边上课、一边治病、一边作科学研究，所以半年多来已写出科学论文五十多篇，大大提高和锻炼了学生的科学分析能力。
