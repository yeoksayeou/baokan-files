Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 16th: Commercial departments in Sichuan Province have put forward the slogan "Purchase new products if they are produced, promote production if they are not," seizing the opportunity to purchase native products. Currently, purchase plans have been arranged for major bulk native products, such as raw lacquer, rosin, Chinese gall, tung seed, wild plants, and Chinese medicinal materials, and some have already begun to be purchased for transfer to other areas.

The Sichuan Province commercial departments have listed the work of purchasing native products as one of the important business projects this year. At the beginning of this year, the commercial departments, in coordination with relevant departments, investigated the production of major products, opened up new production areas, and purchased them in a timely manner. For example, raw lacquer used to mainly rely on the eastern Sichuan area, but now it is also produced in the northern Sichuan mountain area. Sichuan Province has pine forests everywhere, but in the past only the Fuling, Jiangjin, and Daxian special districts harvested rosin. Now, Leshan, Wanxian, Luzhou, and other special districts are also organizing manpower to harvest it. It is planned that 70% of the rosin purchased by the province this year will come from new areas. Currently, it is the harvesting season for raw lacquer and rosin, and various places have arranged 25,000 laborers to carry out rush harvesting. After investigating the production of local small native products, the commercial department of Xuyong County immediately displayed samples in rural stores and public canteens, marked prices, and launched purchases. Within half a month, it purchased 28 kinds of Chinese medicinal materials that had never been purchased locally, totaling more than 100,000 jin. Originally, the county could only transfer 400 dan of Chinese medicinal materials in the contract signed at the special district material exchange meeting, but now a single township can transfer several thousand dan.

Local commercial departments have improved their purchasing methods based on the production characteristics of small native products. For example, Hejiang County implements the method of collecting both retail and wholesale, and purchasing on arrival, according to the scattered and sporadic characteristics of small native products. After Fengming District adopted this method, it purchased more than 460,000 jin of various medicinal materials worth more than 32,000 yuan in half a month. In addition to widely promoting the purchase and sale contract system to closely integrate production and sales, the commercial system also holds various material exchange meetings and increases market days to facilitate farmers' sales and consumers' retail purchases.

Local commercial departments also actively participate in the production of native products. According to the principle of simultaneously promoting self-sufficient production and commodity production, the Luzhou Special District Commercial Department assisted relevant departments in planning the planting area of ​​medicinal materials and economic forests, and arranging labor, so that the entire district planted more than 14,600 mu of more than 70 kinds of main medicinal materials such as honeysuckle, Chinese goldthread, and fingered citron, and more than 175,000 mu of economic forests such as raw lacquer, mulberry, tung, and tea, which was several times larger than last year. Shizhu County, the main production area of ​​Chinese goldthread in Sichuan Province, has expanded the variety of bulk medicinal materials from more than 180 to more than 230 with the assistance and arrangement of commercial departments, and changed more than 20 kinds of wild medicinal materials to domestic cultivation; the number of communes planting Chinese goldthread has increased from 20 to 30.

    四川商业部门加强调查开辟新区
    抓时机收购土特产品
    新华社成都16日电  四川省商业部门提出“已产新的抓收购，未产新的抓生产”的口号，抓紧时机收购土特产品。目前已对主要的大宗土特产品，如生漆、松香、五棓子、桐碱、野生植物、中药材等，安排了收购计划，并且已有一部分开始收购外调。
    四川省商业部门把作好土特产品的收购工作，列为今年的重要业务项目之一。在今年年初，商业部门就和有关部门配合，调查了主要产品的生产情况，开辟新的产区，及时收购。如生漆过去主要是靠川东地区，现在川北山区也生产了。四川省到处都有松林，但是以往只有涪陵、江津、达县三个专区采割松香，现在乐山、万县、泸州等专区也组织人力采割，今年全省计划收购的松香，将有70％来自新区。目前，正值生漆、松香采割季节，各地已安排二万五千个劳动力在突击采割。叙永县商业部门在调查清楚当地小土产品的生产情况以后，立即在农村商店和公共食堂陈列样品，标出价格，展开收购，在半个月内就收购了当地从来没有收购过的中药材二十八种，共十多万斤。原来这个县在专区物资交流会上签订的合同中，只能外调四百担中药材，现在仅一个乡就可以外调几千担。
    各地商业部门根据小土特产品的生产特点，改进收购方法。如合江县根据小土产品分散、零星的特点，实行零整都收、随到随收的办法。凤鸣区采取这个办法后，在半月内就收购了价值三万二千多元的各种药材四十六万多斤。商业系统除了广泛推行购销合同制度，把产销紧密结合起来以外，还举办各种物资交流会，增加赶场期，便利农民出售和消费者零星购买。
    各地商业部门还积极参与土特产品的生产。泸州专区商业部门根据自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的原则，协助有关部门规划药材、经济林木的种植面积，安排劳力，使全区在短期内种植了金银花、黄连、佛手等七十多种主要药材一万四千六百多亩，生漆、桑、桐、茶等经济林木十七万五千多亩，比去年扩大了几倍。四川省主要黄连产区石砫县，经过商业部门的协助安排，大宗药材品种已由一百八十多种扩大到二百三十多种，并将二十多种野生药材改为家生；种植黄连的公社由二十个增加到三十个。
