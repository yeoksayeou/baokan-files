    A Red Banner in Nursery Tool Reform - Beizhen, Liaoning
    (Our dispatch) Beizhen County, Liaoning Province, has mobilized the masses to reform nursery tools. Over the past few years, they have created and improved a total of 96 types of tools, including seedling plows, seeders, cultivators, fertilizer applicators, and water pumps. Currently, the county has basically eliminated manual operations for nursery sowing and seedling lifting. Cultivation, watering, and transplanting all use improved tools, which greatly improve labor productivity and save labor. According to statistics from the state-owned nursery in Beizhen County alone, the use of improved tools in 1958 saved more than 2,300 workdays compared to the use of old tools in previous years. At the same time, it reduced labor intensity and improved operation quality. This county has become a red banner in the national nursery tool reform.
    Beizhen County is a semi-mountainous county. Forestry production is an important part of the county's production. After the establishment of forestry nurseries throughout the county in 1956, forestry labor increased greatly, and conflicts arose between agricultural and forestry labor. The contradiction became even more prominent during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In order to solve this contradiction and allow agriculture and forestry to leap forward together, the county party committee, while carrying out the agricultural tool reform movement, actively carried out a mass movement to reform forestry tools. The county party committee incorporated the forestry tool reform work into the county's tool reform plan, made unified arrangements, and organized several appraisal meetings and exhibitions to promote the continuous development of the forestry tool reform movement. The people's communes also included forestry tool reform in their work agenda.
    In order to meet the needs of a greater leap forward in agricultural and forestry production this year, under the leadership of the county party committee and the county people's committee, the people of Beizhen County continue to hold high the red banner of forestry tool reform and advance victoriously. The county plans to improve and create 1,000 to 1,500 forestry tools this year. It is required that all state-owned nurseries achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization of major operations. It is required that commune nurseries achieve semi-mechanization, key nurseries achieve mechanization of deep plowing and seedling lifting, and tool improvement be achieved in seed collection, afforestation, and logging.

    育苗工具改革的一面红旗——辽宁北镇
    本报讯　辽宁省北镇县发动群众改革育苗工具，几年来，已创造和改进了起苗犁、播种机、中耕器、追肥器、抽水车等工具共九十六种。目前，全县育苗撒种和起苗，已基本上消灭了手工操作，中耕、浇水、移苗等，也都使用了改良工具，大大提高了劳动生产率，节约了劳力。仅北镇县国营苗田统计，1958年使用改良工具后比往年使用旧工具时省工二千三百多个。同时，减轻了劳动强度，提高了作业质量。这个县成为全国育苗工具改革的一面红旗。
    北镇县是一个半山区县。林业生产是该县的一项重要生产内容。1956年全县普遍建立林业苗圃后，林业用工大大增加，农林用工出现矛盾。特别是在1958年的大跃进中，矛盾更加突出。为了解决这一矛盾，使农业、林业一同跃进，县委在开展农业工具改革运动的同时，积极开展林业工具改革的群众运动。县委将林业工具改革工作纳入全县工具改革规划之内，统一安排，并组织了几次评比会、展览会，以促进林业工具改革运动的不断发展。人民公社也将林业工具改革纳入工作日程。
    为了适应今年农业和林业生产更大跃进的需要，北镇县的人民群众，在县委、县人委的领导下，继续高举林业工具改革的红旗，乘胜前进。全县计划在今年内改进和创制林业工具一千到一千五百件。要求国营苗圃全部实现半机械化和主要作业机械化。要求公社育苗达到半机械化，重点苗圃深翻、起苗实现机械化，采种、造林、采伐等实现工具改良化。
