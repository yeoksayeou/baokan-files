(Editor's note: The issue of productivity in the construction industry is one of the items to be discussed at the upcoming plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the 24th of this month. The Soviet "Pravda" published an article on June 1st by Rogionov, Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the CPSU, titled "New Developments in Residential Construction in Leningrad." Excerpts are translated below:)

The speed and quantity of construction in Leningrad are increasing daily. In 1955, the year before the 20th Congress of the CPSU, a total of 400,500 square meters of housing was built in the city; last year, the year before the 21st Congress of the CPSU, it was 732,500 square meters; and this year the residential construction area will reach 900,000 square meters.

All our housing here is usually built according to standard designs. The use of reinforced concrete structures and components is increasing year by year. The current policy is full mechanization, vigorous development of assembly line operations, large components, and fully prefabricated residential construction methods.

Last year, the CPSU City Committee, with the participation of scientists, designers, and construction workers, formulated and approved a program for demonstration construction in Leningrad in the near future. The area of experimental construction is over 200,000 square meters. During the design, construction, and commissioning of these buildings, all issues related to the most rapid transition to large-scale and highly industrialized construction of fully prefabricated, economical housing will be studied.

The new conditions of production in the construction industry require new organizational forms. The organizational forms currently used are too large and complex. They do not help solve the main task of being economical, fast, and good. In the past, when there were no factories capable of producing entire house components, that form was justified. Now the conditions have fundamentally changed, and it is possible to transition to a fundamentally new and more advanced housing construction organization – the housing construction integrated enterprise.

The essence of the problem lies in the fact that highly mechanized industrial enterprises – housing construction integrated enterprises – can manufacture all the main structures and components of buildings, and can assemble the buildings themselves on the assembly site until they are completely built.

The new construction organization can link the assembly line production of finished products with the assembly line fast assembly method. Leningrad is building five housing construction integrated enterprises, and they should be completed this year. The production capacity of these enterprises will reach 550,000 to 570,000 square meters of housing per year in the second year. Each housing construction integrated enterprise will produce a complete set of house structures and components of a certain standard according to the design drawings.

The cost per square meter of housing area built by the integrated enterprise is 1,000 to 1,100 rubles. This can result in 30% to 40% more housing built with the same amount of investment than ordinary construction industry organizations can build.

The preliminary work experience of the Polyustrovsky housing construction integrated enterprise has already proven that this construction form can make residential construction fast and economical. Now the Demidkin Communist Labor Team is transitioning to assembling various parts directly from the transportation vehicles, completing a five-story, eighty-room house in twenty-five to thirty days, and this is not the limit.

Favorable conditions are being created for the most productive use of manpower, construction machinery, and mechanical equipment. The expenditure on mechanization tools alone will be reduced by 12% to 16%. In addition to reducing direct expenditures, various miscellaneous expenses should be reduced, especially administrative management personnel, by at least 20%.

Establishing a housing construction integrated enterprise is a new big step in strengthening economic accounting and saving money.

Preliminary experience also shows that the new housing construction methods help transition to more rational planning and construction of residential blocks. Not long ago, the average area of a block did not exceed eight hectares. Now the area of new large residential areas is twenty, thirty, and fifty hectares, and sometimes even exceeds one hundred hectares.

This is not all that is new in Leningrad's construction practice. Our architects and construction workers have created house designs that start construction from the roof. In other words, the roof and the top layer are assembled first, and the first layer is assembled last. The Barrikada Village has recently started assembling this unusual house.

What are the advantages of the new house structure method? There is no high-rise crane on the new construction site. The roof and each floor are assembled below (on the ground). The next step is to send the assembled floors up. This is achieved with hydraulic cranes. The house is sent up layer by layer, as if sliding upwards along reinforced concrete columns with ten fulcrums. One person operates the floor lift on a special work platform.

Another new thing adopted on this construction site is the use of lightweight wall panels made of chipboard (covered with reinforced concrete). The thickness of this wall panel is only eighteen centimeters, while the thickness of ordinary wall panels is fifty centimeters; this wall panel weighs eight hundred kilograms, while the weight of ordinary ones is three to four tons.

Building houses using the lifting floor method is still a first in our country's residential construction practice.

The news about the convening of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU to discuss major issues such as the further development of our country's socialist industry and construction industry has aroused warm responses and new labor upsurges among Leningrad construction workers. They guarantee that they will complete the half-year plan for housing construction before the opening of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

### 住宅建筑中的新事物

    住宅建筑中的新事物
    编者按：关于建筑业的生产问题，是即将在本月24日召开的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议讨论的项目之一。苏联“真理报”6月1日刊登了苏共列宁格勒市委书记罗吉昂诺夫的一篇文章，题目是“列宁格勒住宅建筑中的新事物”。摘译如下：
    列宁格勒建筑的速度和数量日益增长。在1955年，即在苏共第二十次代表大会举行的前一年，全市共建筑了四十万零五千平方公尺的住宅；在去年，即在苏共第二十一次代表大会举行的前一年，为七十三万二千五百平方公尺；而今年住宅建筑面积将达到九十万平方公尺。
    我们这里所有的住宅照例都是按照标准图样建造的。采用钢筋混凝土结构和构件正在逐年增加。现在的方针是全盘机械化、全力发展流水作业、大构件、完全装配式的住宅建筑法。
    去年苏共市委在科学家、设计师和建筑工人的参与下，制订并批准了列宁格勒最近期间内进行示范建筑的纲领。实验性建筑的面积在二十万平方公尺以上。在设计、建造和动用这些建筑物的过程中，将研究一切有关最迅速过渡到大规模和高度工业化建筑完全装配式的、经济的住宅的一切问题。
    建筑业生产的新条件要求新的组织形式。现在普遍采用的组织形式过于庞大复杂。它不能有助于解决又省、又快、又好这个主要任务。过去，当还没有能生产整个房屋构件的工厂时，那种形式是有理由的。现在条件起了根本的变化，已有可能过渡到原则上新的、更先进的住宅建筑组织——住宅建筑联合企业。
    问题的实质在于，高度机械化的工业企业——住宅建筑联合企业可以制造建筑物的一切主要结构和构件，并且可以在装配场上自己装配建筑物，直到完全建成为止。
    新的建筑组织可以把制成品的流水作业生产同流水式快速装配法联结起来。列宁格勒正在建设五座住宅建筑联合企业，并且应该在今年完工。这些企业的生产能力在第二年将达到一年施工五十五万到五十七万平方公尺住宅。每一个住宅建筑联合企业将按设计图样生产一定标准的全套的房屋结构和构件。
    由联合企业建造的房屋每平方公尺住宅面积的造价为一千至一千一百卢布。这可以在同量的投资下比普通建筑业机构所造的房屋多30％至40％。
    波柳斯特罗夫斯克住宅建筑联合企业的初步工作经验已经证明，这种建筑形式可以使住宅建筑又快又省。现在杰米德金共产主义劳动队过渡到直接从运输工具上装配各个部分，在二十五天到三十天内就完成一幢五层楼的有八十套房间的住宅，这还不是极限。
    正在为最有生产效能地利用人力、建筑机器和机械而创造有利条件。单是用于机械化工具的经费就将缩减12％至16％，除了降低直接耗费以外，要减少各种杂费，特别是至少要减少20％的行政管理人员。
    建立住宅建筑联合企业，这就在加强经济核算和节约方面跨了新的一大步。
  初步经验还表明，新的住宅建筑方法有助于过渡到更合理地计划和建筑住宅街区。不久前，一个街区的平均面积没有超过八公顷的。现在新的大住宅区的面积有二十、三十和五十公顷，而有时甚至超过了一百公顷。
    这并不是列宁格勒建设实践中的全部新东西。我们的建筑师和建筑工人制成了从屋顶开始施工的房屋设计图。换句话说，首先装配屋顶和最上一层，最后才装配第一层。巴里卡达村最近已经开始装配这种不平常的房子。
    房屋的新结构法的优越性在哪里？在新的建筑场地上没有一架高塔起重机。屋顶和各层装配都是在下面（地上）进行的。下一步是把装好的楼层送上去。这是用水力起重机实现的。房屋先上后下这样一层一层地送上去，仿佛沿着有十个据点的钢筋混凝土柱向上滑动一般。由一个人在专门的工作台上操纵着楼层上升。
    在这个建筑工地上还采用一个新东西，这就是用刨花板（外包钢骨水泥）制成的轻便墙板。这种墙板的厚度只有十八公分，而一般的墙板有五十公分厚；这种墙板重量为八百公斤，而一般的重量是三至四吨。
    用升吊楼层的方法建造住宅在我国住宅建筑实践中还是第一次。
    关于召开苏共中央全会讨论进一步发展我国社会主义工业和建筑业等重大问题的消息，在列宁格勒建筑工人中间引起了热烈的反应和新的劳动高潮。他们保证，要在苏共中央全会开会之前完成建设住宅的半年计划。
