Experiences in Participating in Psychological Academic Discussions
Cao Richang, Deputy Director of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Last August, Beijing's psychological circles launched an academic criticism campaign, focusing on criticizing the supra-class viewpoints in psychological teaching and research (such as treating altruism and selfishness as personality differences) and the "biologization tendency" of studying human psychological activities solely from physiological and biological perspectives. This played a significant role in eliminating the influence of bourgeois academic thought in psychology. However, overcorrection led to some deviations. Therefore, after the criticism, the psychological community had to reconsider some of the issues involved in the criticism.

In March of this year, Beijing's psychological circles held a symposium to discuss the tasks and nature of psychology, as well as the class nature and commonality of human psychology. In mid-May, in commemoration of the "May Fourth" Movement, Beijing's psychological research and teaching units jointly held an academic discussion. Through discussion, everyone unanimously recognized that although psychology is still in its early stages of development, it has a promising future and is a discipline with great potential. This strengthened confidence in psychological research. In the discussion, everyone also unanimously felt that our theoretical level was not high and our research results were too few. Therefore, everyone resolved to study hard and work diligently to promote the rapid development of psychology.

We Must Correctly Treat the Relationship Between Scientific Theories and Ideological Systems

I participated in both the academic criticism last year and the academic discussion this year, and I gained some experience: To make academic criticism and discussion fruitful, first, we must correctly treat issues such as the relationship between scientific theories and ideological systems, and between scientific research and practical tasks; second, we must implement the Party's policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom, and engage in free discussion to persuade people with reason.

Every class has its own ideological system, and every ideological system tries to utilize various scientific theories, but a scientific theory does not necessarily belong to a specific ideological system. For example, the bourgeois ideological system uses the theory of evolution to attempt to prove that "free competition" is the eternal law of human society, but the theory of evolution is a scientific truth and does not belong exclusively to the bourgeoisie. The same is true in psychology. Fechner used Weber's law to prove his animism and attack materialism, but Weber's law is a scientific law and is not bourgeois ideology in itself. In academic criticism, we cannot say that valuing Weber's law is a manifestation of bourgeois thought simply because Weber's law was once used by the bourgeoisie.

We must smash the bourgeois ideological system, but we must inherit and absorb the scientific theories used by the bourgeois ideological system. Science is continuous. If we throw away everything related to the bourgeois ideological system, we will truly become "cave dwellers." We must critically absorb the things of the bourgeoisie, that is, we must discard the dross and take the essence. Therefore, we cannot say that accepting scientific facts and laws related to the bourgeois ideological system is a manifestation of bourgeois thought. However, we are influenced by bourgeois thought, and our evaluation of bourgeois scientific work may be incorrect.

There are often disputes in various sciences. Psychology, because the object of study is particularly complex and the history of scientific psychology is not long, has particularly many disputes. For example, the nature and research methods of psychology have long been debated in modern psychology. Psychologists in capitalist countries have argued that psychology is a natural science, while others have argued that it is a social science. Some believe that psychological phenomena can be studied using experimental methods of natural science, while others believe that highly complex psychological activities cannot be studied in simplified conditions in the laboratory. The psychological community in socialist countries also has the same disputes. In such academic disputes, both sides may have one-sidedness, or one side may be more correct while the other side lacks sufficient evidence. Before we obtain sufficient evidence to prove which side is correct, we should not easily draw conclusions. Even less should we simply classify one side's opinion into one ideological system and the other side's into another. In last year's psychological criticism campaign, many comrades regarded the opinions that psychology is close to natural science and that psychology can be studied by experimental methods as bourgeois thought. This was obviously because they did not handle the relationship between scientific theory and ideological system well.

We Must Have a Comprehensive Understanding of the Policy of Integrating Theory with Practice

Theory comes from practice, and all theories are summaries of practical experience. Scientific theory is a summary of the experience of the struggle for production or class struggle. This is the truth that Marxist epistemology (the theory of practice) tells us. Production tasks are the driving force for the development of science. They raise research topics for science and provide opportunities and standards for science to test the truth of theories. Scientific research must proceed from reality and serve production and construction. Integrating theory with practice is a policy that all sciences should follow when arranging work. But there are also differences between science and production. If scientific research does not detach from reality to a certain extent at a certain stage, and if all scientific workers devote themselves to production labor, then there will be no scientific research or scientific theory, and it will not be possible to serve the cause of production and construction well.

All sciences have their own systems, and all have historical continuity and internationality. In order to make the system more complete, science itself sometimes raises some research topics, which are not necessarily directly related to the current production and construction practice. In addition, some topics are inherited from the history of science, or are jointly attacked by the international scientific community, and are not necessarily related to the current production and construction practice of the country. These topics are raised because of the needs of scientific development. Their solution will also enable science to develop. Therefore, in the final analysis, it is still beneficial to the cause of construction. We should not fail to conduct research because they are unrelated or have little relationship to the current construction practice.

In March last year, the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched a major debate on the issue of research direction. As a result of the debate, the majority of people agreed with the views of the "practical school" (I am also a member of the "practical school"). The research organization was adjusted, and the original four groups divided according to the theoretical system of disciplines, namely evolution, perception, thinking, and personality, were changed into three groups respectively linked to the actualities of education, labor and medical treatment. Researchers were also assigned to work in schools, factories and hospitals respectively. After a few months, problems arose. Educational psychology workers only participated in teaching work, labor psychology comrades were satisfied with the improvement of production efficiency, and those participating in medical work only pursued the curative effect on mental patients. They did not pay enough attention to summarizing scientific theories from practical work, and it was difficult for them to carry out their work further. In October, the Institute of Psychology conducted another "brainstorming," affirming the correctness of the direction of integrating theory with practice, clarifying the policy of driving disciplines with tasks, affirming the importance of theoretical research, and reorganized the research organization, establishing a research group for applied electrophysiology and other new technologies to study the brain's reflective functions.

Now the understanding of the problems debated in March last year is different again. Now it is recognized that it is mainly social production practice that promotes the development of science, but the internal logic (or contradiction) of the scientific system is also a driving force for the advancement of science. In order to make psychology serve the socialist construction of the motherland more effectively, it is necessary to improve and improve mainly in practice, but also to improve the level from theoretical research. It is now recognized that deviating from reality is a wrong direction for scientific research and should be criticized and corrected; but we must have a comprehensive understanding of the policy of integrating theory with practice, and theoretical research cannot be ignored, so as to promote the healthy development of science.

Academic Discussions Should Be Frequent

During the criticism campaign in August last year, there was a situation: it seemed that a line was drawn among the participants in the movement, with one side being the critics and the other being the criticized. The opinions of the critics seemed to be all correct. All the remarks of the criticized were manifestations of bourgeois thought. This situation was not conducive to academic criticism and discussion, the discussion could not be developed in depth, and the phenomenon of overcoming one-sidedness with one-sidedness (correctly speaking, replacing one-sidedness with one-sidedness) occurred, and academic problems could not be truly solved.

In the symposium in March this year and the discussion meeting in commemoration of "May Fourth," the situation was different. Everyone expressed their own opinions, spoke freely, felt comfortable, and was lively and vigorous. Various arguments were put forward. After discussion, a consensus was reached on some issues, that is, they were resolved, at least temporarily resolved. There were still different opinions on some issues, but after discussion, the issues were clarified, and each school of thought knew itself and the other. In the future, they will all carry out research according to their own views and methods with a spirit of modesty in learning and adhering to the truth, and then compare and argue in research results. In the process of discussion, some new issues were raised. These issues were raised on the basis of the previous issues being resolved or clarified, and are further issues. The solution of these problems in the future will surely promote the development of psychology and improve the level of psychology by one step.

It can be said that this year's discussion is a continuation and development of last year's criticism. Last year, some cleaning work was done, and this year, a big step forward has been taken in the new direction. It can be clearly seen that this year's achievements are more and greater than last year's. From last year's criticism to this year's discussion is a process of gradual improvement and a process of gradually implementing the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. This fully proves the correctness and greatness of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. In future academic activities, if this policy is better implemented, various scientific undertakings will inevitably achieve rapid and great development.

In all sciences, especially in a young discipline like psychology, which has a particularly complex object of study, the influence of bourgeois academic thought is difficult to eliminate at once. Science is developing rapidly. Today's seemingly correct conclusions may turn to their opposite and become incorrect due to the emergence of new facts. Therefore, academic criticism and discussion should be frequent. The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the principle guiding academic criticism and academic discussion, and it is also a driving force for promoting scientific progress. As Premier Zhou Enlai recently said: "We believe that after the free debate of different schools and different views in science and the free competition of different forms and different styles in art, it will not be long before our scientific and cultural undertakings will be able to enter a prosperous era and achieve great achievements" ("Government Work Report" of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress).

    参加心理学学术讨论的体会
    中国科学院心理研究所副所长　曹日昌
    去年8月北京心理学界开展了一次学术批判活动，着重批判了心理学教学和研究中的超阶级观点（如把大公无私和自私自利当作个性差异）和专从生理和生物学方面研究人的心理活动的“生物学化倾向”，对于清除心理学中资产阶级学术思想的影响，起了很大的作用，但矫枉过正，也发生了一些偏差。所以在批判以后，心理学界又不得不重新考虑批判中所涉及的一些问题。
    今年3月，北京心理学界举行座谈会，讨论心理学的任务、性质以及人的心理的阶级性和共同性等问题。5月中，为纪念“五四”，北京心理学研究和教学单位联合举行了学术讨论会。经过讨论，大家一致认识到：心理学虽然还在幼年发育阶段，但是前途无量，是一门大有可为的学科，因之对于心理学研究工作都增强了信心。在讨论中，大家又一致感觉到：我们的理论水平不高，研究成果太少。所以大家下定决心，要努力学习，切实工作，促使心理学迅速地发展。
    必须正确对待科学理论与思想体系问题
    去年的学术批判和今年的学术讨论，我都参加了，得到了一点体会：要使学术批判和讨论获得丰富成果，第一，必须正确对待科学理论与思想体系和科学研究与实践任务等问题；第二，必须贯彻党的百家争鸣、百花齐放的方针，自由讨论，以理服人。
    每个阶级都有它的思想体系，每种思想体系都尽量利用各种科学理论，但一种科学理论不一定属于特定的思想体系。例如资产阶级的思想体系利用进化论，企图证明“自由竞争”是人类社会的永恒规律，但进化论是科学真理，不专属于资产阶级。心理学上也是如此。费希纳利用韦伯律证明他的泛灵论，并用以攻击唯物主义，但韦伯律是科学规律，并不就是资产阶级思想。在学术批判中，我们不能根据韦伯律曾被资产阶级利用，因而说重视韦伯律就是资产阶级思想。
    资产阶级的思想体系我们是要打烂的，但为资产阶级思想体系所利用的科学理论，我们则要继承、吸收。科学是有继承性的，我们若把一切和资产阶级思想体系有关的东西都扔掉，我们就真要成为“穴居野人”了。我们对资产阶级的东西要批判地吸收，也就是要去其糟粕，取其精华。因此，不能把接收和资产阶级思想体系有关的科学事实规律说成是资产阶级思想的表现。但是，我们受有资产阶级的思想影响，对资产阶级的科学工作的估价可能不正确。
    各种科学上都经常有一些争论。心理学由于所研究的对象特别复杂，科学的心理学的历史还不长，所以争论也特别多。例如，关于心理学的学科性质和研究方法，是近代心理学上久经争论的问题。资本主义国家的心理学者，有人主张心理学是一门自然科学，也有人主张是一门社会科学；有人认为心理现象可以用自然科学的实验方法进行研究，有人认为高度复杂的心理活动不能在实验室内简单化的条件下进行研究。社会主义国家的心理学界也有同样的争论。这类的学术争论，可能双方面都有片面性，也可能一方面比较正确，另一方面证据不够充分。在我们获得充分论据足以证明那一方面正确以前，不可轻易作结论。更不能简单地把一方面的意见划入一种思想体系，把另一方面的划入另一种思想体系。去年在心理学批判活动中，不少同志把认为心理学接近自然科学和心理学可以用实验方法进行研究的意见，都当作资产阶级思想，显然是由于没有很好处理科学理论和思想体系的关系问题的缘故。
    对理论联系实际的方针要有全面的理解
    理论来自实践，一切理论都是实践经验的总结，科学理论是生产斗争或阶级斗争的经验的总结，这是马克思主义认识论（实践论）告诉我们的真理。生产任务是推动科学发展的动力，它为科学提出研究的课题，也为科学提供检验理论真伪的机会和标准。科学研究必须从实际出发，为生产建设服务。理论联系实际，是一切科学在安排工作时应当遵循的方针。但科学和生产还有差别，科学研究不等于生产建设事业本身。科学研究如果不在一定阶段和一定程度上脱离实际，科学工作者都去全力从事生产劳动，那末也就不会有科学研究、科学理论，也就不能很好服务于生产建设事业。
    所有科学都有它自己的体系，都有历史继承性和国际性。为了使体系更趋于完整，科学本身有时提出一些研究的课题，这些课题不一定是和当前生产建设实际直接有关的。另外，也有一些课题是由科学历史继承下来的，或是国际科学界共同围攻的，也不一定和本国当前生产建设实际有关。这些课题都是由于科学发展的需要提出来的。它们的解决也会使科学得到发展，因此，算起总账来，还是有利于建设事业的，不应当因为它们和目前的建设实际无关或关系很少而不进行研究。
    去年3月，中国科学院心理研究所展开了一次研究方向问题的大辩论。辩论的结果，多数人赞成“实践派”的主张（我也是“实践派”的一员），调整了研究组织，把原来按学科理论体系分的演化、知觉、思惟、个性四个组改变为分别联系教育、劳动和医疗实际的三个组。研究人员也都分别到学校、工厂和医院进行工作。几个月以后，问题发生了，教育心理工作者只参加教学工作，劳动心理工作同志满足于生产效率的提高，参加医疗工作的仅追求对精神病患的疗效，对于由实践工作中总结科学理论则重视不够，再深入一步进行工作感到困难了。十月间心理研究所又进行务虚，肯定了理论联系实际的方向的正确性，明确了以任务带动学科的方针，肯定了理论研究工作的重要性，又重新调整了研究组织，设立了应用电生理和其他新技术研究脑的反映机能的研究组。
    现在对于去年3月间辩论的问题的认识又不同了。现在认识到：推动科学发展的主要是社会生产实践，但科学体系的内在逻辑（或矛盾）也是推动科学前进的一种动力。为使心理学更有效地服务于祖国的社会主义建设，主要要在实践中锻炼提高，但也要从理论研究中提高水平。现在认识到：脱离实际是科学研究的错误方向，应当批判纠正；但对于理论联系实际的方针要有全面的理解，理论研究不能忽视，这样才能促进科学的健康发展。
          学术上的讨论应当是经常的
    在去年8月的批判活动中有一种情况：好像在参加运动的人中间划了一条线，一边是批判者，一边是被批判者。批判者的意见似乎都是正确的。被批判者的一切言论都是资产阶级思想的表现。这种形势是不利于学术批判、讨论的，讨论不能深入展开，产生了以片面克服片面（正确地说，以片面代替片面）的现象，不能真正解决学术问题。
  在今年3月间的座谈会和纪念“五四”的讨论会中，情形不同了。各抒己有，畅所欲言，心情舒畅，生动活泼。各种论点提出来了。经过讨论，对有的问题取得了一致的意见，也就是解决了，至少暂时解决了。对有的问题还有不同的意见，但经过讨论，问题明确了，各家各派都知己知彼，今后都本虚心学习、坚持真理的精神，照自己的观点、方法，进行研究，将来在研究成果上再行较量、争论。在讨论过程中又提出了一些新的问题，这些问题是在以前的问题解决了或明确了的基础上提出来的，是进一步的问题。将来这些问题的解决，就一定会促进心理学的发展，使心理学的水平提高一步。
    可以说，今年的讨论是去年批判的继续深入和发展。去年做了一些清扫工作，今年则在新方向上前进了一大步，今年的成绩比去年更多更大，是可以清楚地看出来的。由去年的批判到今年的讨论，是一个逐步提高的过程，也是一个逐步贯彻党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针的过程。这充分证明党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针的正确伟大。在今后的学术活动中，更好地贯彻这个方针，各种科学事业必然会得到迅速巨大的发展。
    在各门科学中，特别是像心理学这样一门年轻的、研究的对象又特别复杂的学科中，资产阶级学术思想的影响是难于一次肃清的。科学都是在迅速发展中的，今天看来是比较正确的结论，由于新事实的出现，也会转向它的对立面，变成不正确的。所以，学术上的批判、讨论应当是经常的。百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策是指导学术批判和学术讨论的原则，也是推动科学向前发展的一种动力。正如周恩来总理最近所说：“我们相信，经过科学上不同学派、不同见解的自由争论，艺术上不同形式、不同风格的自由竞赛，不要很久，我们的科学文化事业一定能够进入一个昌盛的时代，并且获得伟大的成就”（二届人大一次会议“政府工作报告”）。
