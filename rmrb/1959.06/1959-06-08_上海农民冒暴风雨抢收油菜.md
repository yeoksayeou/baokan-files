Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: Shanghai suburban farmers braved rainstorms to harvest and thresh summer crops, not allowing the fruits of their hard-won bumper harvest to suffer losses.

On the afternoon of the 3rd, after hearing the news that there would be force six to eight winds and heavy rain, the suburban counties of Shanghai immediately held telephone or radio conferences to instruct the communes and production teams to rush to harvest the ripe summer crops and to do a good job in preventing rain and wind in other areas.

Nanhui County put forward the battle slogan of "Competing with the sky for oil and grain, everyone is responsible" to the people of the county in the telephone conference. When the wind and rain came that night, more than 70,000 people in the county participated in the harvest. After their day's efforts, they finally harvested all 12,000 mu of ripe rapeseed that had not yet been cut in the county. All officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhoupu Town also went out in the rain to help Xiulong Brigade and Yingfang Brigade of Zhoupu Commune harvest 78 mu of rapeseed. Many agencies, schools, and commune members in Nanhui also vacated houses to store rapeseed. Teachers and students from Shanghai Foreign Language Institute and Shanghai Fisheries College also fought alongside commune members in Baoshan County and harvested 10,000 mu of rapeseed in one day. The commune members of Wujiaochang in Jiangwan Commune, Baoshan County, immediately organized forces to thresh the 1,483 mu of harvested rapeseed. Those who did not have time to thresh were sent to warehouses for storage.

On the afternoon of the 3rd, Huangqiang Management Area in Jiading County divided its forces into three groups: one group to rush to harvest rapeseed, one group to inspect the drainage ditches in the fields, and one group to inspect the reinforcement work of the sheds. Qingpu County specially sent cadres to the management areas and production teams to inspect the fish ponds to prevent fish seedlings from being washed away by the water.

On the 4th, many cadres and commune members in the suburbs of Shanghai also braved the rain to dig drainage ditches in the fields or spread rapeseed indoors to dry.

    上海农民冒暴风雨抢收油菜
    新华社上海7日电　上海市郊区农民冒暴风雨抢收抢打夏收作物，不让到手的丰产果实遭受损失。
    3日下午，市郊各县听到将有六级到八级大风和大雨的消息后，立即分别召开电话或广播会议，布置各公社、生产队抢收已成熟的夏收作物，以及做好其它方面的防雨防风工作。
    南汇县在电话会议中向全县人民提出了“与天争油粮、人人有责”的战斗口号，当晚，风雨来临时，全县有七万多人参加抢收。经过他们一天的努力，终于把全县已成熟而尚未割完的一万二千亩油菜全部割完。驻周浦镇的解放军全体官兵也冒雨出动，帮助周浦公社秀龙大队、营房大队抢收了七十八亩油菜。南汇许多机关、学校、社员也腾出了房子堆放油菜。上海外国语学院、水产学院师生也和宝山县社员一起奋战，一天就抢收油菜一万亩。宝山县江湾公社五角场的社员们，对已收割的一千四百八十三亩油菜，立即组织力量脱粒。来不及脱粒的就送仓库贮藏。
    嘉定县黄墙管理区在3日下午分兵三路，一路抢收油菜，一路检查大田开沟排水，一路检查棚架加固工作。青浦县特地派干部到各管理区和生产队检查鱼塘，防止鱼秧被水冲跑。
    4日，上海市郊的许多干部、社员还冒雨在田间开沟排水，或在屋内摊晾油菜。
