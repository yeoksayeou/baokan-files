Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 23rd: Indian Prime Minister Nehru arrived in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala, yesterday.

Shortly after his arrival, he held separate talks with Governor Rao, Chief Minister Namboodiripad, Kerala State Congress Party Chairman Shankar, and All-India Congress Committee General Secretary Sadiq Ali, among other Congress party members. Ali was dispatched from New Delhi to observe the situation there.

It is reported that Nehru will also meet with representatives of the Catholic Church and other parties involved in the current movement.

Nehru is visiting Kerala at the invitation of Kerala Chief Minister Namboodiripad. Namboodiripad invited Nehru to study the situation created by the movement against the state government.

The actions of those opposing the state government in setting up picket lines at government offices are still taking place in the central areas of various regions, as a prelude to "direct action." Various opposition parties and caste forces have once again planned this "direct action" in an attempt to bring the Kerala state government to a "standstill" on June 26th.

According to the Press Trust of India, Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ghosh told a press conference in Madurai, Madras, yesterday that the Indian Communist Party and the Kerala state government would do everything within their power to enable Prime Minister Nehru to find a way to achieve reconciliation between the state government and the opposition parties. He reaffirmed that the Kerala state government does not need to be favored in upholding the spirit of the constitution, but is unwilling to tolerate any discrimination.

    印总理尼赫鲁到喀拉拉邦
    高士重申邦政府不需要偏袒也不愿容忍歧视
    新华社新德里23日电　印度总理尼赫鲁昨天到达喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅。
    他到达后不久，就同邦长拉奥、首席部长南布迪里巴德和喀拉拉邦国大党主席山卡尔和印度国大党全国委员会总书记萨迪克·阿里等国大党人分别举行会谈。阿里是从新德里派去观察那里的局势的。
    据报道，尼赫鲁还将同天主教主教方面以及那些同目前运动有关的其他方面会晤。
    尼赫鲁是应喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德的邀请访问喀拉拉邦的。南布迪里巴德邀请尼赫鲁去研究那里反对邦政府运动所造成的局势。
    反对邦政府的人在政府各办公处布置纠察哨的行动仍旧在各地区的中心进行着，这是“直接行动”的前奏。各反对党和教族力量已再度策划这种“直接行动”，企图在6月26日使喀拉拉邦政府陷于“瘫痪状态”。
    据印度报业托辣斯说，印度共产党总书记高士昨天在马德拉斯的马都莱举行记者招待会说，印度共产党和喀拉拉邦政府将在他们权力范围内使尼赫鲁总理能够找到使邦政府和反对党之间取得和解的办法。他重申，在维护宪法精神问题上，喀拉拉邦政府不需要受偏袒，但是不愿容忍任何歧视。
