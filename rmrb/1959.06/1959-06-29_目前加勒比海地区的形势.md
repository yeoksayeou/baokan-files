The Current Situation in the Caribbean Region
Zhang Ye

As the Cuban Revolution continues to advance, the struggle against U.S. aggression and interference and against dictatorial regimes is expanding throughout the Caribbean region, dealing new blows to U.S. imperialism and the dictatorial regimes it supports. At the same time, the United States, with the interference in the Cuban Revolution as its main focus, is intensifying its conspiracy to suppress national independence movements in the Caribbean region. Therefore, the struggle between the people of the Caribbean countries and U.S. imperialism and its agents is becoming more acute.

New Revolutionary Storm

Recently, in the Caribbean region at the back door of the United States, a new revolutionary storm has swept: the Cuban people are carrying out land reform on a large scale and have launched a nationwide movement against U.S. intervention; armed uprisings against U.S. puppet dictatorships have broken out in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic; and the struggle of the people in other countries in the region for national independence, economic autonomy, and democratic freedom is also developing.

Land reform is a major measure of the Cuban Revolution and a sign of its continued progress. The land reform law stipulates the abolition of the large estate system and the implementation of relatively thorough land reform, which will first seriously hit the interests of U.S. monopoly capital, as it is the main large estate owner in Cuba. Of the 252,000 caballerías (approximately 201.28 Chinese mu per caballería) of land to be reformed, 23 U.S. companies alone own 108,000 caballerías. At the same time, Cuba's land reform, like Cuba's revolutionary victory, has a profound impact on the national independence movement in Latin America. This is because all Latin American countries have land problems, especially the large estate system and the issue of U.S. plundering of land. This is why U.S. imperialism desperately opposes Cuban land reform.

The influence of the continued development of the Cuban Revolution, especially on the Caribbean region, is expanding. The recent upsurge in the anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle in the Caribbean region illustrates this point. After the Cuban Revolution, the United States intensified its conspiracy activities in the region, trying on the one hand to maintain the crumbling dictatorial regimes in countries such as Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, constantly supplying them with weapons and money, while these dictatorial regimes also strengthened their repressive measures; on the other hand, it arranged for armed intervention in the Cuban Revolution in these countries. But things have developed in the opposite direction, with armed uprisings against dictatorship breaking out in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. The anti-American struggles of the people of other countries have also developed. In March, the Mexican government passed a decree protecting national industries against the monopoly of U.S. automobile manufacturers, stipulating that foreign automobile manufacturers in Mexico must use Mexican materials and parts; the meeting of Ministers of Interior of five American countries rejected the proposal by the Guatemalan Minister of Interior, instigated by the United States, to establish an "international police force"; in January, the Panamanian government rejected the U.S. government's "protest" against Panama's expansion of its territorial waters to twelve nautical miles; the Venezuelan government refused to accept U.S. loans with harsh conditions and opposed U.S. measures restricting oil imports... All these events have powerfully shaken U.S. control and first hit the U.S. plan to interfere in Cuba.

At present, the armed struggles launched in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic have drawn the necessary experience from the Cuban Revolution. They have formed national democratic united fronts of varying degrees, with various opposition parties, including the Communist Party, participating in leading the uprising movement. Their armed struggles are gaining the support of the vast number of peasants. In this way, the people's struggle in this region has begun to develop from the vicious circle of coups and counter-coups that used to occur frequently to a stage of being more organized, led, and having anti-imperialist goals.

At the same time, the development of the anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle in the Caribbean region has forced U.S. imperialism to cope with attacks from all sides on several fronts, which is greatly conducive to the Cuban people consolidating the revolution and repelling U.S. intervention. Now, in the struggle against U.S. armed intervention and strengthened control, the people of the Caribbean countries have shown a climate of mutual influence, support, and cooperation. This is a significant development trend.

U.S. Conspiracy to Expand Intervention

Because the countries of the Caribbean region are close to the United States, are highly economically dependent on the United States, and the reactionary forces bought by the United States are relatively strong, while the degree of development of the people's struggles in various countries is different, the development of the national democratic revolutionary struggle in the Caribbean region will inevitably be an arduous, tortuous, and complex process.

At present, the United States is using all its favorable conditions to expand its intervention activities, with the spearhead mainly aimed at the Cuban Revolution, but also at the anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggles in other countries in the region; and its main methods, in addition to economic threats and inducements and political division activities, are using the "Organization of American States" that it controls to plan armed interventions similar to the subversion of the democratic government of Guatemala. In April and May, the U.S. State Department successively convened meetings of ambassadors from twelve countries in the Caribbean region and ambassadors from ten countries in South America, discussing the Cuban Revolution and the situation in the entire Caribbean region, deciding to continue to provide assistance to the pro-American dictatorial regimes in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Haiti, and requesting the U.S. State Department to "seriously consider what measures the 'Organization of American States' can take to restore calm in the Caribbean region."

In order to create a pretext for armed intervention, U.S. military and political figures and propaganda machines have vigorously attacked Cuba's revolutionary measures, spreading rumors that Cuba is in danger of "going red," and instigating pro-American regimes such as the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Guatemala, which are hostile to Cuba, to clamor about the threat of Cuban "invasion," demanding that the United States and the "Organization of American States" "take measures." At the same time, the United States personally dispatched agents to lead a group of armed personnel intending to enter Nicaragua from Cuba, creating the so-called incident of Cuban "invasion" of Nicaragua, but they were intercepted by the Cuban government before they left Cuba. After this shameful conspiracy failed, the United States created the sensational Cuban "invasion" of Panama incident, sending warships and planes to the Panamanian coast to assist in defense, and organizing an "investigation committee" through the "Organization of American States" to conduct "investigations" in the villages occupied by the "invaders." After armed uprisings broke out in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, the United States and its pawns also clamored about Cuban "invasion," instructing the "Organization of American States" to establish a so-called "investigation committee" to conduct "investigations," and actively planning to organize an "international police force." The U.S. Senate also passed a resolution allocating $29.5 million in "loans" to establish this force. These are all a series of steps taken by the United States to plan armed intervention in Cuba and other countries.

Despite the fact that all these conspiracies have been met with powerful counterattacks, the United States is still stepping up its activities to militarily intervene in Cuba. The United States still occupies a military base in Cuba. At the same time, the U.S. state of Florida, which extends toward Cuba, especially Miami, has become a base for subversive conspiracies against Cuba. The United States here provides a large amount of military supplies to the Batista elements who have fled to the United States, and then, under the protection of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, these traitors of the Cuban people transport the military supplies from Miami to the rebel elements who are launching armed attacks on Cuba. Dominican dictator Trujillo has also gathered his planes, ships, and troops, waiting for U.S. orders to attack Cuba. All of this deserves serious vigilance.

History Will Not Repeat Itself

However, it is not easy for the United States to repeat its trick of intervening in Guatemala in 1954 today. Now it is 1959, the international situation has undergone a fundamental change in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, and the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are generally on the rise. The Cuban Revolution is not as isolated as the Guatemalan Revolution was back then. They have the support of the people of Latin America and the sympathy of the people all over the world. The Cuban people are mobilizing to fight to defend the revolution and defend land reform. The people of other countries in the Caribbean region are also uniting to fight for national independence and democratic freedom.

The armed intervention activities planned by the United States have not only been met with resolute counterattacks by the Cuban people, but have also been strongly protested by the people of other countries. Representatives from Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia have opposed the United States' use of the "Organization of American States" to carry out intervention deployments. The parliaments of Venezuela, El Salvador, and Costa Rica have also passed resolutions opposing U.S. intervention activities, and the demonstrations by the people in the capitals of Honduras and Nicaragua against the organization's "investigation" activities are obvious examples.

The Cuban people are working hard to strengthen revolutionary unity, the Cuban government is strengthening armed forces to resolutely defend the revolution and repel aggression, and the mutual support of the countries in the Caribbean region and throughout Latin America in the anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle are all important factors that prevent the "Guatemalan incident" from being repeated.

The era of the United States running rampant in Latin America is over. The struggle against U.S. control, enslavement, and plunder is in full swing. As long as the people of Cuba and other Latin American countries strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, the large-scale intervention activities currently being carried out by the United States can be defeated.

    目前加勒比海地区的形势
    章叶
    正当古巴革命继续向前发展的时候，整个加勒比海地区反对美国侵略和干涉、反对独裁政权的斗争在扩展着，给了美帝国主义和它支持的独裁政权以新的打击。而同时，美国也正在以干涉古巴革命为主要矛头，在加勒比海地区加紧布置镇压民族独立运动的阴谋活动。因此，目前加勒比海地区国家人民同美帝国主义及其代理人的斗争更趋尖锐化。
    新的革命风暴
    最近一个时期，在美国后门口的加勒比海地区，卷起了新的革命风暴：古巴人民正在大规模地实行土地改革，并且展开了反对美国干涉的全民运动；尼加拉瓜和多米尼加先后爆发了反对美国傀儡独裁政权的武装起义；这个地区其他国家的人民争取民族独立、经济自主和民主自由的斗争也在发展。
    土地改革是古巴革命的一项重大措施，是古巴革命继续向前发展的标志。土地改革法规定废除大庄园制度，进行比较彻底的土地改革，这首先要严重打击到美国垄断资本的利益，因为它是古巴的主要的大庄园主。在将要实行土地改革的二十五万二千卡瓦耶里亚（每卡瓦耶里亚约合二百零一点二八中国亩）的土地中，仅仅二十三家美国公司就拥有十万八千卡瓦耶里亚。同时，古巴的土地改革和古巴的革命胜利一样，在拉丁美洲的民族独立运动中具有深远的影响。因为拉丁美洲各国都存在着土地问题特别是大庄园制度和美国掠夺土地的问题。这都是美帝国主义拼命反对古巴土地改革的原因。
    古巴革命继续发展所引起的影响，特别是对加勒比海地区的影响，正在扩大。最近加勒比海地区反美反独裁斗争的高涨，就说明了这一点。古巴革命后，美国加紧在这一地区进行阴谋活动，一面力求保持尼加拉瓜和多米尼加等国摇摇欲坠的独裁政权，不断把武器和金钱供给它们，而这些独裁政权也加强了它们的镇压措施；另一面在这些国家布置对古巴革命的武装干涉。但事情的发展走到它的反面，尼加拉瓜、多米尼加爆发了反对独裁的武装起义。其他一些国家的人民的反美斗争也有了发展。墨西哥政府在3月间曾经针对美国汽车制造商的垄断通过了一项保护民族工业的法令，规定在墨西哥的外国汽车制造商必须使用墨西哥的材料和零件；美洲五个国家内政部长会议否决了美国指使危地马拉内政部长提出的建立一支“国际警察部队”的提议；巴拿马政府1月间拒绝了美国政府对巴拿马扩大领海范围到十二浬的“抗议”；委内瑞拉政府拒绝接受美国附有苛刻条件的贷款，并反对美国限制石油进口的措施……所有这些事件，都有力地动摇了美国的控制，首先打击了美国干涉古巴的计划。
    目前，尼加拉瓜和多米尼加展开的武装斗争，已从古巴革命中吸取了必要的经验。他们形成了不同程度的民族民主统一战线，包括共产党在内的各个反对党参加领导起义运动。它们的武装斗争正在得到广大农民的支持。这样，就使这一地区人民的斗争开始从过去经常发生的政变和反政变的恶性循环，发展到比较有组织、有领导并有反帝目标的阶段。
    与此同时，加勒比海地区反美反独裁斗争的发展，使得美帝国主义不得不在几条战线上应付四面八方的打击，这大大有利于古巴人民巩固革命，反击美国的干涉。现在，在反对美国武装干涉和加强控制的斗争中，加勒比海地区各国人民出现了互相影响、支持和配合的气象。这是具有意义的发展趋势。
    美国扩大干涉的阴谋
    由于加勒比海地区国家紧靠着美国，对美国的经济依赖性很大，美国收买的反动势力较强，而各国人民的斗争的发展程度不同，这都不能不使加勒比海地区民族民主革命斗争的发展，将是一个艰巨、曲折和复杂的过程。
    目前美国正在利用它的一切有利条件，扩大它的干涉活动，其矛头主要针对着古巴革命，同时也针对着这一地区的其他国家的反美反独裁斗争；而其主要的手法除了在经济上的威胁利诱以及政治上的分裂活动以外，正在利用它所控制的“美洲国家组织”策划类似颠复危地马拉民主政府的武装干涉。美国国务院在4、5月间先后召开了驻加勒比海地区十二个国家使节的会议和驻南美十个国家使节的会议，讨论了古巴的革命和整个加勒比海地区的局势，决定继续给多米尼加、尼加拉瓜和海地的亲美独裁政权以援助，要求美国国务院“严加考虑‘美洲国家组织’能采取那些措施来恢复加勒比海地区的平静”。
    为了制造武装干涉的借口，美国的军政要人和宣传机器，大肆攻击古巴的革命措施，造谣说古巴有“赤化”的危险，并唆使敌视古巴的多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、海地、危地马拉等亲美政权，叫嚣古巴“入侵”的威胁，要求美国和“美洲国家组织”“采取措施”。同时，美国还亲手派遣特务率领一群武装人员打算从古巴进入尼加拉瓜，制造所谓古巴“入侵”尼加拉瓜的事件，但是，他们没有离开古巴就被古巴政府截获了。这个可耻的阴谋流产以后，美国又制造了曾经轰动一时的古巴“入侵”巴拿马事件，一面派遣军舰和飞机到巴拿马海岸协助防守，一面通过“美洲国家组织”组织一个“调查委员会”到“入侵”人员占领的村庄进行“调查”。尼加拉瓜和多米尼加爆发武装起义后，美国和它的走卒也在叫嚣古巴“入侵”，授意“美洲国家组织”设立所谓“调查委员会”进行“调查”，并且积极策划组织“国际警察部队”。美国参议院还通过决议，拨出二千九百五十万美元的“贷款”，用来建立这支部队。这都是美国布置武装干涉古巴和其他国家的一系列步骤。
    尽管这一切阴谋活动受到了有力的反击，但美国仍在加紧进行武装干涉古巴的活动。美国在古巴还占据着军事基地。同时，伸向古巴的美国佛罗里达半岛，特别是这个半岛的迈阿密，已经成了颠复古巴阴谋活动的根据地。美国在这里把大批军火供给逃亡到美国的巴蒂斯塔分子，然后再在美国联邦调查局的保护下，由这些古巴人民的叛徒把军火从迈阿密运出，交给武装进攻古巴的叛乱分子。多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略也把他的飞机、舰只和部队都集结起来，等待美国的命令进攻古巴。这都是值得严重警惕的。
    历史不会重演
    但是，美国想在今天重演1954年干涉危地马拉的拿手好戏，已经很不容易了。现在是1959年，国际局势发生了东风压倒西风的根本变化，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动普遍高涨，古巴人民的革命决不像当年危地马拉革命那样的孤立了。他们有着拉丁美洲人民的支持和全世界人民的同情，古巴人民正动员起来为保卫革命、保卫土地改革而斗争。加勒比海地区其他国家的人民也正在团结起来，进行争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争。
    美国策划的武装干涉活动，不仅遭到古巴人民的坚决反击，而且也遭到其他国家人民的强烈抗议。古巴、委内瑞拉和玻利维亚的代表都反对美国利用“美洲国家组织”进行干涉部署。委内瑞拉、萨瓦尔多、哥斯达黎加的国会并通过决议反对美国的干涉活动，洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜两国首都的人民对这个组织进行“调查”活动的游行示威，都是明显的例证。
    古巴人民努力加强革命团结，古巴政府加强坚决保卫革命、反击侵略的武装部队，以及加勒比海地区和整个拉丁美洲各国在反美反独裁斗争中的互相支持，这都是使“危地马拉事件”不能重演的重要因素。
    美国在拉丁美洲恣意横行的时代过去了。反对美国控制、奴役和掠夺的斗争方兴未艾。只要古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家的人民加强团结，坚持斗争，美国目前进行的大规模干涉活动，是可以被击败的。（附图片）
