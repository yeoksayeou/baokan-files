　　Successful Cultivation of Summer-Ripening Guanggan Oranges

　　Jiangjin County, Sichuan, famous for its sweet oranges, has now successfully cultivated four summer-ripening Guanggan orange trees, each capable of producing approximately 70 catties of fruit. The fruit is brightly colored, juicy, and delicious. These four Guanggan orange trees were developed by the Jiangjin Horticultural Experiment Station, which discovered two late-maturing Guanggan oranges in Yangbaxi, Xianfeng District, Jiangjin, in 1951. In 1953, they were grafted onto four large Guanggan orange trees. Through extensive research and careful cultivation, the phenomenon of fruit drop was overcome, ensuring that over 90% of the fruit ripened in May.

　　Dispatching Machinery to Support Wheat Harvesting in Beijing Suburbs

　　In order to support the Beijing suburbs in their rush to harvest wheat, Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces have dispatched a batch of combine harvesters and threshing machines. The Beijing Tractor Station has made specific arrangements for the use of the dispatched machinery, generally selecting areas and communes with concentrated wheat fields, flat terrain, and significant labor shortages for harvesting.

　　Abundant Fish Fry on Both Banks of the West River in Guangxi

　　Hundreds of thousands of people along both banks of the West River in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are catching fish fry day and night to take advantage of the flood season. Over the past month, the entire autonomous region has caught over 2.72 billion fish fry of various types, a significant increase compared to the same period last year. The fish fry produced here, in addition to supplying various parts of the autonomous region for developing fisheries, are also sold to other areas. By the end of May this year, over 510 million fish fry had been transported to Yunnan, Guangdong, Guizhou, and other provinces. This year, fish fry production command posts were established in the counties of the fish fry production areas, command centers were established in the communes, and specialized teams were formed in the production teams, with dedicated personnel responsible at each level, summarizing the fish fry production experience of previous years and vigorously promoting advanced technical measures, resulting in a significant increase in output.

    培育夏熟广柑成功
    盛产甜橙的四川江津县，现在又培育出夏熟广柑树四株，每株能摘果子七十斤左右。果子颜色鲜艳汁多味美。这四株广柑树是江津园艺试验站于1951年在江津先峰区杨坝溪发现两株晚熟广柑，1953年嫁接在四株大广柑树上。经过多方面研究和精心培育，克服了落果现象，保证90％以上的果子在5月间成熟。

    广西西江两岸鱼苗多
    广西僮族自治区西江两岸成千上万群众，日夜迎汛捞鱼苗。一个多月以来，全自治区已捞得各种鱼苗二十七亿二千多万尾，比去年同期增加很多。这里产的鱼苗，除供应自治区各地发展渔业外，还远销外地。今年到5月底止，已运往云南、广东、贵州等地鱼苗五亿一千多万尾。今年在鱼苗产区的县成立了鱼苗生产指挥部，公社成立了指挥所，生产队组成了专业组，层层有专人负责，总结历年来的鱼苗生产经验，大力推广先进技术措施，因而产量大大提高。
