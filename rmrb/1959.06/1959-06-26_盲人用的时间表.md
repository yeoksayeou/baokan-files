    Time Table for the Blind
    A "Braille Time Table" has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Ximenzi Clock and Watch Glasses Center Store of the Shanghai Penglai District Department Store. This watch runs very accurately and is very convenient for the blind to use, as they can know the time simply by touching it with their hands. After blind people personally tested it, the effect was very good.

    盲人用的时间表
    一种“盲人手摸时间表”最近在上海蓬莱区日用百货公司西门子钟表眼镜中心店试制成功。这种表走的很准确，盲人使用时非常方便，只要用手一摸就能知道时间。经过盲人亲手试摸，效果很好。
