    Editor's Notes
    Technology and Quality
    Why is it that Zhang Dewen, a lathe operator at the Jiangbei Machinery Factory in Jilin, produced nearly 60,000 products, every single one of them qualified, and Wang Wenhao, a lathe operator at the Changchun Instrument Factory, produced no rejects for three years? One of their important experiences is: constantly improving tools and constantly improving operating skills.
    Why is it that when technology improves, quality also has the potential to improve?
    The reason is simple. Any industrial product is the result of technical operations. Under the same production equipment and raw material conditions, products of different quality will appear in the hands of operators with different skill levels. A skilled person can not only quickly become familiar with the essentials of the drawings and skillfully master the performance of the machine, thereby confidently producing products that meet the specifications. Conversely, a person with a low level of technical skill cannot grasp the essentials of the drawings at once, is unfamiliar with the performance of the machine, and is distracted when operating it. The products produced will inevitably have quality problems.
    Of course, improving technical skills is not the same as improving product quality. While improving technology, we must also pay attention to improving political and ideological awareness. Politics is the commander, the soul. With politics in command, there can be a meticulous spirit. Therefore, with politics plus technology, plus a complete inspection system, improving quality can be assured.
    Trademark Issues
    A trademark is a symbol of a commodity.
    There are tens of thousands of kinds of commodities. Without trademarks, it would be impossible to distinguish the variety and quality of the commodities, the source of the commodities, and the responsible unit for commodity production.
    For many years, consumers' habit of choosing commodities has often been based on trademarks. Some well-known brands have left a reliable reputation in the minds of consumers due to their low prices and high quality. Some consumers can buy them back with satisfaction without having to choose, as long as they see the trademark brand. This fact reflects the representative role of trademarks in product quality. Those who understand this principle pay special attention to quality inspection in the management of enterprises, and never casually abuse trademarks to affect prestige.
    Supervising product quality through trademarks is a traditional experience that we need to promote and use.

    技术和质量
    为什么吉林江北机械厂车工张德文生产近六万件产品，件件合格，长春仪器厂车工王文诰三年没有出废品？他们的一条重要经验就是：不断改进工具，不断提高操作水平。
    为什么技术提高了，质量也就有可能提高呢？
    道理很简单，任何一件工业产品，都是技术操作的结果。同样的生产设备和原料条件，在不同水平的操作者手里，会出现不同质量的产品。一个技术熟练的人，他不仅可以很快地熟悉图纸的要领，娴熟地掌握机器的性能，从而有把握地生产出合乎规格要求的产品。反之，一个技术水平不高的人，图纸要领一下掌握不住，机器的性能不熟悉，操作起来顾此失彼，生产出来的产品，也就难免要发生质量问题。
    当然，提高技术水平并不等于就是提高了产品质量。在提高技术的同时，还要注意提高政治思想觉悟。政治是统帅是灵魂，有了政治挂帅，才能有一丝不苟的精神。所以政治加技术、再加上一套完整的检查制度，提高质量，才可以稳操胜券。
    商标问题
    商标，是商品的标志。
    商品的种类成千上万，没有商标就弄不清商品的品种和质量、商品的来源和商品生产的负责单位。
    多少年来，消费者选购商品的习惯，往往以商标为依据。有些名牌商品，由于价廉物美，在消费者心目中留下了可靠的信誉。某些消费者只要看到商标牌号，就可不用选择，满意地购买回去。这个事实，反映了商标对于产品质量带有代表性的作用。懂得这个道理的人，在企业的经营管理上，特别注意质量检查，决不随随便便滥用商标，影响威信。
    通过商标监督产品质量是一种传统经验，这种经验，我们需要加以发扬和运用。
