Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th. Shaanxi province is taking measures to incubate large numbers of chicks. According to incomplete statistics from eleven counties and cities including Xi'an, Jingbian, Tongchuan, and Xingping, more than 2.3 million chicks have been hatched in the past two months.

Since this spring, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Commerce have jointly run three poultry incubation training classes, training nearly a hundred incubation technicians for various counties. Commercial departments have also equipped poultry-producing areas with dozens of electric incubators. Lantian County's communes have established eleven incubation farms, training thirty-seven artificial incubation technicians, ensuring that each commune has two incubation technicians.

In the work of incubating chickens, communes and production teams also mutually support each other with hatching eggs and help improve technology.

    陕西大量孵小鸡
    新华社西安28日电陕西各地采取措施，大量孵化小鸡。据西安市、靖边、铜川、兴平等十一个县市不完全统计，最近两个多月来已孵化出小鸡二百三十多万只。
    今春以来，陕西省农林厅和商业厅联合开办了三期家禽孵化训练班，为各县培训孵化技术员近百名。商业部门还为家禽产区配备了几十部电孵器。蓝田县各公社建立了十一个孵化场，培训了三十七名人工孵化技术员，使每个公社都有两个孵化技术员。
    在孵鸡工作中，各公社和生产队还互相支援种蛋和帮助提高技术。
