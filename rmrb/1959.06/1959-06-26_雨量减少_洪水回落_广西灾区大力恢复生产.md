Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, June 25th: In the past two days, rainfall in Guangxi has greatly decreased, and floods in rivers have begun to recede. Disaster-stricken areas are vigorously restoring production. To compensate for losses, corn, sweet potatoes, and melons have been planted on land washed away by the floods. Flooded seedlings are being drained, washed, and fertilized. Early rice and corn that have been harvested are being dried and baked to prevent mold. Collapsed mountain ponds and reservoirs, as well as damaged roads, bridges, and telecommunications equipment in some areas, are being repaired.

Guangxi has experienced heavy rain and high water levels this year. From May 1st to June 20th, continuous rainfall occurred throughout the region. According to statistics from six special zones, including Nanning and Liuzhou, rainfall has increased by 87% compared to the average rainfall for the same period in previous years. Rainfall was particularly concentrated from June 10th to 14th, with rainfall exceeding 100 millimeters in 19 counties, including Hengxian and Laibin, and exceeding 300 millimeters in eight counties, including Guiping and Du'an. The water levels of the Liujiang, Guijiang, and Hongshui Rivers generally rose by seven to thirteen meters, reaching flood levels. The water levels of the Zuojiang, Youjiang, Yujiang, and Xijiang Rivers generally rose by five to nine meters, reaching dangerous levels. After continuous heavy rain, approximately 1.5 million mu of farmland throughout the region were flooded, of which more than 400,000 mu suffered a reduction in yield of half or were completely lost.

Prior to the flood's arrival, all localities had made full preparations for combat, thus greatly reducing the extent of the losses. In Lingui County, before the heavy rain on the 17th, the county organized manpower in advance based on weather forecasts. When the heavy rain arrived, more than 40,000 people were immediately mobilized to rescue more than 40,000 mu of seedlings. In the Nanning Special Zone, dedicated personnel were assigned to care for all major water conservancy projects before the heavy rain, thus preventing major accidents. In Yongfu County, rainfall of 150 millimeters in previous years would have caused severe disasters. This year, thanks to the numerous water conservancy projects and prior precautions, although rainfall reached 189 millimeters, the area affected was smaller than in previous years.

In the struggle to prevent floods and provide disaster relief, members of people's communes in various places supported each other, cooperated, and demonstrated the enormous power of people's communes with their large populations and strong capabilities. Six communes, including Chengxiang and Danzhu in Pingnan County on both sides of the Xijiang River, formed a flood prevention army of 20,000 people. Under the leadership of the county party secretary, they secured fixed areas, contracted responsibility by area, and blocked breaches in the river embankment several times, preventing seedlings from being flooded. When the Liao Xiu Brigade of Siwang Commune faced the imminent flooding of more than 3,000 mu of rice paddies, members of the neighboring Guiping County, upon learning of the situation, immediately organized a rescue force and braved the rain to provide assistance. In flood prevention, the Renhe Commune in Cangwu County implemented front and rear coordination based on labor strength, mobilizing more than 5,000 people a day to repair nine river dikes, protecting more than 1,800 mu of paddy fields, and also harvesting more than 2,000 mu of rice.

In severely affected areas, the lives of the masses have been properly resettled due to the prompt rescue efforts of the Party and the government. In Teng County, which was severely affected, more than 2,900 people have moved into the homes of cadres and commune members in non-disaster areas. After the summer harvest, the communes will make unified plans to help these commune members build houses and rebuild their homes.

    雨量减少　洪水回落
    广西灾区大力恢复生产
    新华社南宁25日电　最近两天，广西各地雨量大为减少，江河洪水开始回落，受灾地区正在大力恢复生产。为了弥补受灾损失，被洪水冲光的土地上，已抢种上玉米、红薯、瓜类；被浸泡过的禾苗，开始进行排水、洗苗、追肥；已经抢收下来的早稻玉米，正在加紧晾晒、烘烤，防止霉烂。崩漏的山塘、水库及部分地区损坏的公路、桥梁、电讯设备，正在抢修。
    广西今年雨多水大。自5月1日至6月20日，全区各地连续降雨，据南宁、柳州等六个专区统计，降雨量比历年同期平均雨量增加87％。特别在6月10日到14日，雨量尤为集中，横县、来宾等十九个县的降雨量达一百公厘以上，其中桂平、都安等八个县的降雨量达三百公厘以上。柳江、桂江、红水河等水位，普遍上涨七公尺到十三公尺，达到洪水位，左江、右江、郁江、西江水位，普遍上涨了五公尺到九公尺，达到危险水位。连续暴雨之后，全区共淹没农田一百五十万亩左右，其中减产一半和完全失收的有四十多万亩。
    在这次洪水袭击之前，各地事先都做了充分的战斗准备，因而损失程度大为减少。临桂县在17日大雨前，根据气象预报，事先组织好人力，在大雨到来时，马上出动了四万多人，抢救了禾苗四万多亩。南宁专区在大雨前，所有较大水利工程，都派出了专人护理，因而没有发生重大事故。永福县在往年雨量达一百五十公厘时，就会造成重灾，今年由于水利工程多，事前作好防范，这次降雨虽达一百八十九公厘，而受灾面却比往年减少。
    在防汛救灾斗争中，各地人民公社社员互相支援，分工协作，显示了人民公社人多势众的巨大威力。西江两岸的平南县城厢、丹竹等六个公社，组成了二万人的防汛大军，在县委书记率领下，固定地区，分片包干，数次堵住了河堤缺口，使禾苗未遭水淹。思旺公社廖秀大队有三千多亩水稻，眼看就要淹没，毗邻桂平县的社员们获悉情况后，马上组织救援大军，冒雨救援。苍梧县人和公社在防汛中，根据劳动力强弱，实行前后方协作，一天出动了五千多人，修好河提九条，保住了一千八百多亩水田，同时还抢刈稻谷二千多亩。
    受灾严重的地区，由于党和政府的迅速抢救，群众生活上已得到了妥善安置。受灾较重的藤县，有二千九百多人已搬进机关和非灾区社员的家中住下。夏收后，公社将统一规划，扶助这些社员盖好房屋，重整家园。
