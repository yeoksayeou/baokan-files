According to a Zhejiang Daily report: More than 150,000 mu of rapeseed in Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, achieved a large-scale bumper harvest. A total of 227,070 dan of dried rapeseed were harvested, which is 3.5% more than the total rapeseed production of the county in the eleven years since 1948. The average yield per mu was 151 jin, an increase of 13.53% over last year. Among them, 34,621 mu had an average yield of up to 229.5 jin per mu.

Cixi County is a cotton and spring flower double-cropping area. Historically, the county has grown more beans and wheat, and rapeseed has accounted for a very small proportion of the total spring flower area. Before liberation, the unit yield was only 30 to 40 jin. At that time, the highest yield of rapeseed per mu was in Andong, with a yield of only 133 jin per mu. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the rapeseed planting area has gradually expanded, and the yield has gradually increased. After the people's communes were established last year, Party committees at all levels and the broad masses of people vigorously promoted oil production. The rapeseed planting area increased from 18,000 mu in 1958 to more than 150,000 mu, and the average yield per mu increased by 13.53% compared with last year.

After the people's communes were established, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses was further brought into play, and advanced technologies were widely promoted. These created conditions for this year's large-scale bumper harvest of rapeseed. The liberation of female labor enabled winter planting production to be completed quickly and well even under particularly tight labor conditions. After communization, the experience of high-yield rapeseed production was widely exchanged and promoted. Deep plowing was increased from four cun in previous years to seven or eight cun, and even more than one chi. The density of planting increased from 7,000 to 8,000 plants per mu in the past to about 20,000 plants. During the cultivation process, they overcame four cold waves and disasters such as drought, insects, and diseases. Under the slogan of "cultivate every plant, and harvest every plant cultivated," they launched a struggle against drought to protect seedlings. Waterwheels were set up everywhere, pumping water day and night to irrigate the seedlings. Many commune members slept in the fields to cultivate them, and the seedlings finally grew vigorously. The commune members collected fertilizer everywhere, mixed mud from under the houses and garbage, and kneaded them into small "buns," which they stuffed one by one next to the rapeseed roots to provide the rapeseed with sufficient "food."

The leadership of the Party is the guarantee for the large-scale bumper harvest of rapeseed in the county. Since the winter planting last year, Party organizations at all levels have summarized the high-yield experience of rapeseed production at each level, mobilized the broad masses to conduct extensive debates on whether rapeseed could be grown well and whether a large-scale bumper harvest could be achieved, overcame various conservative ideas, and aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad commune members to strive for high-yield rapeseed production. From planting to harvesting, leading cadres at all levels conducted experiments, participated in production, and led production, driving the large-field production and enabling rapeseed to develop in a balanced manner.

After the bumper harvest of rapeseed, the income of the commune members also increased. In most of the production teams in the county, the income of more than 90% of the commune members increased, averaging 56% more than last year. Everyone praised the people's communes as good. Many commune members used part of the cash they had received to buy piglets, and the number of pigs raised quickly increased from the original 175 to 287. The surplus money was deposited in the credit cooperative or used to purchase some daily necessities.

Encouraged by the bumper harvest of rapeseed, the commune members became more and more energetic, and a race to catch up with each other appeared everywhere, which strongly promoted the current cotton production. In the past five days, the 217,000 mu of cotton fields in the county have generally undergone a soil loosening, weeding, and pest control. The 95,000 mu of early rice have generally been weeded three times, and topdressing has been applied two or three times. More than 10,000 mu of yellow seedlings have now turned green.

    慈溪十五万亩油菜大丰收
    播种面积超过去年七倍　单位产量增加13.5％
    据浙江日报消息　浙江省慈溪县十五万多亩油菜大面积丰收。共收干菜籽二十二万七千零七十担，比该县从1948年以来的十一年油菜籽产量总和多3.5％。平均亩产一百五十一斤，比去年增产13.53％。其中有三万四千六百二十一亩，平均亩产高达二百二十九斤半。
    慈溪县是棉花、春花两熟制地区。历来，该县多种豆、麦，油菜在春花总面积中所占的比重很小。解放前单位产量只有三、四十斤，当时产量最高的一亩油菜出在庵东，亩产量只有一百三十三斤。解放后，在党的领导下，油菜种植面积逐年扩大，产量逐年提高。去年人民公社化以后，各级党委和广大群众大抓油料生产，油菜种植面积由1958年的一万八千亩扩大到十五万多亩，平均亩产量比去年增加13.53％。
    人民公社化以后，广大群众的劳动热情得到了进一步发挥，先进技术得到了普遍推广，这些都为今年油菜大面积丰收创造了条件。妇女劳动力的解放，使冬种生产在劳动力特别紧张的情况下，既快又好地完成了任务。公社化后，油菜高额丰产经验得到了广泛交流和推广，深耕由往年的四寸加深到七、八寸，以至一尺以上；密植程度由过去每亩七、八千株增加到二万株左右；在培育过程中，他们战胜了四次寒潮和旱、虫、病等灾害。在“有一株培育一株，培育一株要收一株”的口号下，开展抗旱保苗斗争，到处架起水车日夜不停地车水灌苗，不少社员睡在田头培育，菜苗终于茁壮地成长起来了。社员们到处搜集肥料，把房屋地底泥、垃圾等混和起来，捏成一个个小“馒头”，一个个塞到油菜根边，给油菜喂足了“食粮”。
    党的领导是全县油菜籽获得大面积丰收的保证。从去年冬种以来，各级党的组织层层总结油菜高产经验，发动广大群众对能不能种好油菜、能不能获得大面积丰收开展了大鸣大放大辩论，克服了种种保守思想，鼓起了广大社员争取油菜高产的革命干劲。从种到收，各级领导干部层层搞试验，参加生产，领导生产，带动了大田生产，使油菜得到平衡发展。
    油菜籽大丰收以后，社员收入也增加了。全县绝大部分生产队都是90％以上的社员增加收入，平均比去年增加56％，人人称赞人民公社好。许多社员把已分得的一部分现金用来买小猪，猪的饲养量很快从原来的一百七十五头增加到二百八十七头；多余的一部分钱存入了信用部，或添置了一些日用品。
    在油菜籽大丰收的鼓舞下，广大社员干劲越来越足，到处出现了你追我赶的竞赛局面，有力地推动了当前的棉花生产。在最近五天中，全县二十一万七千亩棉地普遍进行了一次松土、除草、除虫等工作。九万五千亩早稻普遍耘出三次田，追肥已施二三次，万余亩黄苗现已转青。
