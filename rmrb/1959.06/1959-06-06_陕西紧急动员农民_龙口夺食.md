    Xi'an, this paper reported on the 5th. In recent days, Shaanxi Province has been hit by continuous rain during the summer harvest. To ensure a bumper harvest, the Shaanxi Provincial Summer Harvest Headquarters held an emergency telephone conference on the evening of the 4th, calling on the province to pay special attention to both quick harvesting and ensuring the quality of the harvest.
    At the meeting, the person in charge of the Summer Harvest Headquarters emphasized that all localities must pay special attention to the quality of harvesting, regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy. In order to get all the abundant wheat harvested, it is necessary to discuss with the masses whether to organize a shock harvest team and whether to work at night. However, regardless of whether it is a shock harvest, using the "walking sickle" or "encircling sickle" method, harvesting during the day or harvesting at night, special attention must be paid to technology, so as not to scatter grain and to cut the wheat stubble as low as possible; also, pay close attention to the safety of people and livestock.
    Currently, all parts of Shaanxi Province feel that the transportation capacity for the wheat harvest is insufficient, and some places can only transport 30% to 40% of the cut wheat back each day. How to solve this problem is a key to ensuring the quality of wheat harvesting in rainy weather. The Summer Harvest Headquarters requires all localities to adopt various methods to give full play to the existing transportation capacity of various vehicles and manpower; and to set up fields on the spot for stacking and threshing, so as to save labor and animal power. In short, efforts should be made to transport all the wheat cut down on the same day to the fields for stacking; if it cannot be transported back on the same day, it should be stacked into small piles on the spot to prevent wind and rain.

    陕西紧急动员农民“龙口夺食”
    本报西安5日电  连日来，陕西省各地在夏收中突遇阴雨的侵袭。为了保证丰产丰收，陕西省夏收指挥部4日晚召开紧急电话会议，号召全省特别注意既要快收快割，又要保证收割的质量。
    会上，夏收指挥部负责人强调要求各地不管晴雨，必须特别注意收割质量。为了把丰收小麦全部抢收到手，要不要组织突击收割队，要不要夜战，要和群众商量决定。但是，不管突击收割，采用走镰或围镰的方法收割，白天收割，夜间收割，都要特别注意讲究技术，既不抛撒粮食，又要把麦茬割得低些；还应该十分注意人、畜的安全。
    目前，陕西省各地感到麦收的拉运力量不足，有些地方每天只能把割倒的麦子运回来30％—40％。如何解决这个问题，是保证雨天收麦质量的一个关键。夏收指挥部要求各地采取各种各样的办法，充分发挥现有各种车辆的运输力量和人的力量；并且就地设场，就地积、碾，节约劳力、畜力。总之，要争取把当天割倒的麦子全部运到场里积好；当天运不回来，也要就地垒成小积，防止风雨的侵袭。
