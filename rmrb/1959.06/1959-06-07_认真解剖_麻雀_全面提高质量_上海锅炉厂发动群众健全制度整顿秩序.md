Shanghai Boiler Factory is comprehensively improving management and quality through the inspection of sixty-five-ton medium-quality boilers, amidst a vigorous mass-based quality inspection campaign.

Factory leadership, through various forms such as big-character posters, mass debates, experience exchanges, exhibitions, and organizing leaders, technicians, and workers to visit users, fully mobilized the masses, and put forward more than 8,000 opinions on quality. Based on the principle of going from small to large and from rough to fine, these issues were ranked and summarized into twelve major issues related to leadership ideology, technical inspection, design, technology, worker operation, etc., and then comprehensively analyzed into fifteen key projects such as changing steel frames to concrete structures and pipe welding.

In order to solve the problems more deeply and thoroughly, under the unified leadership of the factory Party committee, typical product components were selected, and quality inspection core groups were formed in the form of a three-way combination of leaders, technicians, and workers, using the method of dissecting a "sparrow" to inspect, analyze, and study product quality, find the root causes of problems, and then prescribe the right medicine. The quality of the gearbox used to control the operation of the grate was one of the problems that the factory had not completely solved for a long time. This time, with the workshop as the main body, a grate gearbox review group was formed with the participation of technicians, inspectors, and workers to conduct a comprehensive and thorough review. It was determined that the test conditions should first be 12 hours of heavy-load operation and 4 hours of light-load operation, and then all parts should be disassembled and re-inspected one by one according to the drawing requirements for dimensions, smoothness, accuracy, and the meshing of gears and worm gears, while observing whether the parts were properly maintained and whether there were any bumps or rust. Through inspection, a total of eighteen problems, large and small, were found, such as uneven surfaces of the gear box housing, poor bearing lubrication, and dimensions not meeting drawing requirements. Then, relevant department personnel were organized and workers were mobilized to conduct in-depth analysis and repeated discussions, adopting the method of "getting to the bottom of things" to find the causes. In this way, on the one hand, problems were discovered more deeply, making it easier to thoroughly improve them; on the other hand, the quality problems that were inspected vividly educated cadres and the masses. For example, after the metalworking workshop dissected four main components such as gearboxes, grates, valves, and coal throwers, it selected an old worker to convey the problems that were inspected to all the workers in the workshop and organized everyone to have a discussion. In the past, in order to save man-hours, most of the surface scraping process was simplified, and many valves were not oiled. At that time, some inspectors raised opinions, but some comrades did not take it seriously, thinking that these were minor issues. After this inspection, many workers immediately and automatically restored these processes.

In response to the problems that have been inspected, on the basis of universal improvement of understanding among the masses, according to the principle of ensuring both centralized leadership and giving full play to the creativity and initiative of the masses, the masses were mobilized to immediately begin to establish and improve some production management and technical management systems, and strengthen production order. For example, the metalworking workshop has formulated and revised more than a dozen rules and regulations such as the process regulations management system, semi-finished product storage methods, and inspection system, of which seven systems including material storage, semi-finished product storage, and inspection have been implemented in the workshop after discussion and revision by the workers. For all eighteen problems of the entire grate gearbox, more than sixty improvement measures have also been proposed by mobilizing the masses, including new product identification, process document management, machine tool maintenance, technical inspection, production planning, and process assembly management. The seventy-two major problems that were initially inspected and summarized for all sixty-five-ton medium-quality boilers have also been ranked and are being analyzed and studied for improvement in depth.

Through the above work, results have begun to be achieved. For example, the phenomenon of single valve matching in the metalworking workshop used to be above 50%, but has been basically eliminated since May. The scrap rate of castings in the foundry workshop decreased by about 40% in May compared to April. At present, the factory is preparing to continue mobilizing the masses in the in-depth development of the production increase and economy practice centered on high output and high quality, and to further take measures in technology, technical inspection, design, and production management in order to comprehensively achieve high quality and high output.

### 认真解剖“麻雀”　全面提高质量  上海锅炉厂发动群众健全制度整顿秩序

    认真解剖“麻雀”　全面提高质量
    上海锅炉厂发动群众健全制度整顿秩序
    本报讯　上海锅炉厂在开展轰轰烈烈的群众性的质量检查运动中，通过对六十五吨中质锅炉的检查，全面改进管理和提高质量。
    工厂领导通过大字报、大辩论、经验交流、展览会，以及组织有关部门领导、技术人员、工人访问用户等种种形式，充分发动群众，提出了八千多条有关质量方面的意见。根据从小到大、从粗到细的原则把这些问题作了排队，归纳为领导思想、技术检查、设计、工艺、工人操作等十二个方面的主要问题，并从中又综合分析为钢架改混凝土结构、管子焊接等十五个关键项目。
    为了使问题解决得更深更透，在厂党委的统一领导下，选择典型产品的部组件，以领导、技术人员、工人三结合的形式，组成质量检查核心小组，采用解剖“麻雀”的办法来检查、分析和研究产品质量，找出问题的根源，从而对症下药，采取措施。用于控制炉排运转的齿轮箱的质量，是全厂长期未彻底解决的问题之一，这次就以车间为主，由技术员、检查员、工人参加，组成了炉排齿轮箱复查小组，进行全面彻底的复查。确定首先运转十二小时重车、四小时轻车为试验条件，然后再全部拆开来，按图纸要求，一一重新检查零件尺寸、光洁度、精度、齿轮及蜗轮蜗杆的啮合情况，同时察看零件保养是否合乎要求，有否嗑碰、生锈等现象。通过检查，共发现牙箱外壳表面凹凸不平，轴承润滑不良，尺寸不符合图纸要求等大小问题十八个。然后组织有关部门人员和发动工人深入分析，反复讨论，采取“打破砂锅问到底”的办法，找出原因。这样，一方面问题发现得比较深入，便于彻底改进，另一方面通过检查出来的质量问题，生动地教育了干部和群众。如金工车间通过对牙箱、炉排、凡而、抛煤机等四个主要组件的实物解剖后，将检查出来的问题，推选一名老工人向全车间工人传达，组织大家座谈讨论。过去为了节省工时，刮平面工序大部分简化了，很多凡而都不上油，当时有的检查员提出意见，部分同志还不以为然，认为这些都是小事情，这次检查出来，很多工人听了以后，立即就自动恢复了这些工序。
    针对已经检查出来的问题，在群众普遍提高认识的基础上，根据既能保证集中领导，又能发挥群众创造性和积极性的原则，发动群众，立即着手建立和健全了一些生产管理和技术管理制度，加强生产秩序。如金工车间已经制订和修订了工艺规程管理制度、半成品保管办法、检验制度等十几种规章制度，其中材料保管、半成品保管、检验等七项制度，经过工人讨论修改后已在车间贯彻执行。对于整个炉排齿轮箱的十八个问题，也已经发动群众提出了六十多项改进措施，包括新产品鉴定、工艺文件管理、机床维护、技术检查、生产计划、工艺装配管理等十一个方面。对全部六十五吨中质锅炉初步检查归纳出来的七十二项大问题，也作了排队，正深入分析、研究改进。
    通过以上工作，已经开始收到了效果。如金工车间的凡而单配现象，过去都在50％以上，5月份以来已经基本上消灭。铸工车间的铸件废品率5月份比4月份减少了40％左右。目前，工厂准备在深入开展以高产优质为中心的增产节约运动中，继续发动群众，在工艺上、技术检查上、设计上和生产管理上，进一步采取措施，以全面地实现优质高产。
