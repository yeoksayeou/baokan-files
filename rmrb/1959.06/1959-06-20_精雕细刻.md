    "Hey, you servants, quickly prepare my master's four-hoofed horse, so your master can ride on the horse's back to the garden where the flowers grow, to see the pink peach blossoms, the white pear blossoms, and that pretty girl..."

    Similar lines, on the theatrical stage, usually come from the mouths of ridiculous characters. Hearing such lines, the audience can't help but burst into laughter. Look at how verbose this person is, specifying that the horse has four hooves, and explaining that riding a horse means riding on its back... It's truly laughable.

    The "lines" that audiences find laughable aren't just found on stage; sometimes, they can be found in newspapers and books in one or two sentences. Examples such as "a middle-aged woman in her forties," "this is completely unnecessary waste," "a teapot or teacup for drinking tea," can all be used as examples. When people read such sentences, they also laugh. Some people can't help but criticize the writer for being too long-winded: if it's a "middle-aged woman," why write "in her forties"? Does waste need to be divided into necessary and unnecessary? Of course, a teapot or teacup is for drinking tea, does that need to be said?

    On stage, such rambling lines are a conscious affectation by the playwright and actors. The purpose of doing this is not just to make the audience laugh, but mainly to let the audience see the verbose and foolish characteristics of this character. If this character is a scholar, a learned man, or an official, then such lines also contain a deeper satirical meaning. Look, he wants to make his words literary and interesting, trying his best to add sentences and phrases. Who knew that after racking his brains, he couldn't find suitable words, so he could only look at the "pink peach blossoms, white pear blossoms, and that pretty girl." The result is adding feet to a snake, which only exposes his lack of learning and his desire to be refined.

    When we read such verbose sentences in articles, if the author, like the actors mentioned above, is consciously writing this way to achieve a certain artistic purpose, then that's fine. Unfortunately, sometimes when we read such sentences, we can only feel that the author is rambling here, just like the role played by the above-mentioned actor, adding feet to a snake, spoiling things through excessive enthusiasm.

    However, the harm of "adding feet to a snake" goes far beyond this.

    Liu Zhiji, when commenting on the increasingly cluttered and lengthy texts of the Han and Three Kingdoms periods, said: "Searching for redundant sentences, picking out verbose words, in a single line, several words are wrongly added, within a foot of paper, several lines are constantly wasted," leading to "many lights breaking the axle." (See "Shitong" "Narration" chapter) These words are indeed a warning to those who do not pay attention to removing redundant sentences and verbose words. The "many lights breaking the axle" mentioned here is quoted from "Guo Ce," which speaks of Zhang Yi persuading the State of Wei, saying that accumulating many feathers can sink a boat. Liu Zhiji used this classic as a metaphor, wanting to illustrate that accumulating feathers can still sink a boat, and redundant sentences and verbose words are enough to ruin a good article.

    The fact is indeed like this. Sometimes when we read an article, we feel that the theme is originally good, but because the author rambles and piles up a lot of long-winded sentences, it obscures a very meaningful theme. As a student exercise, if it's not written clearly, it doesn't matter much. As an article guiding work or a news report, such a situation can cause inestimable damage to propaganda work!

    Once an article is written and published in newspapers and periodicals, how can it not be exquisitely carved!

    “众家丁，快备大爷我那四个蹄子的马来，待大爷我骑在马的背上，去至生长花儿的花园，看那粉色的桃花，白色的梨花，还有那女的娇娘……”
    类似这样的道白，在戏曲舞台上，通常是出自可笑的人物的口中。听了这样的道白，观众是禁不住要大笑一阵的。你看这个人说话有多么饶舌，说马要注明是四个蹄子的，骑马要说明骑在马的背上……真是可笑。
    观众们觉得可笑的“道白”，不只是出现在舞台上，有时在报刊书本上也会发现那么一句两句。像“一个四十多岁的中年妇女”、“这完全是不必要的浪费”、“喝茶用的茶壶或茶杯”，等等，就可当作例证。读到这样句子，人们也会张口大笑的。有的人，不免还要指责写文章的人太罗嗦：既是“中年妇女”，何必再写“四十多岁”？浪费难道还有必要不必要的分别吗？茶壶或茶杯当然是喝茶用的，那还用说吗？
    在舞台上出现这样罗里罗嗦的道白，那是剧作者和演员有意识的做作。他们这样做的目的，不只是让观众哄笑一场，主要是让观众看清这个剧中人的饶舌、愚蠢的特征。如果这个剧中人是个秀才、学究、官老爷之流，那么这样的道白，还包含着更深的讽刺意义。你看，他要使自己说的话文情并茂、饶有风趣，极力增句添词。谁知搜尽枯肠，没有合适的词儿，只好是看那“粉色的桃花，白色的梨花，还有那女的娇娘”。结果是画蛇添足，正好暴露了他的不学无术又要附会风雅的精神面貌。
    我们在文章中，读到这样罗嗦的句子，如果作者像上述的演员那样，为了达到艺术上的某种目的，有意识这样写，那就好了。遗憾的是有时读到这样的句子，只能感到作者在这里饶舌，就像上述的演员所扮演的角色说的一样，画蛇添足，弄巧成拙。
    然而，“画蛇添足”的害处远远不止于此。
    刘知几评论两汉三国的文史越来越芜杂冗长的时候说：“寻其冗句，摘其烦词，一行之间，必谬增数字，尺纸之内，恒虚费数行”，以致“群轻折轴”。（见“史通”“叙事”篇）这几句话，确是给不注意剔除冗句烦词的人，敲起了警钟。这里说的“群轻折轴”，引自“国策”中说的张仪游说魏国，说到积了许多羽毛，能把一个船都沉下去的古典。刘知几把这个古典当作譬喻，就是想说明积羽尚能沉舟，冗句烦词就足能破坏一篇好文章。
    事实确是这样。我们有时读到一篇文章，觉得主题本来不错，可是由于作者东拉西扯，堆积了好多罗里罗嗦的句子，反而把一个很有意义的主题弄得模糊不清。作为一篇习作，写不清楚，关系还不大。作为一个指导工作的文章或新闻报道，这么一来，在宣传工作上所受的损害就无法估计了！
    写成文章，发表在报刊上，怎能不精雕细刻！
