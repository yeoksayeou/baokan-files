    The Mayor's Heart

    June 4th of this year marked the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Rome from Nazi occupation. The Italian Communist Party, the Italian Socialist Party and others requested that the Rome city government take measures to commemorate this important day.

    Every Italian patriot remembers the heavy disasters that the Italian people suffered during the fascist German brutal rule of Italy fifteen years ago. Italian patriots took up arms to fight for their country’s freedom and waged arduous struggles against fascist Germany and the Italian reactionary government. They personally punished Italy's culprit, Mussolini, drove out the Nazi troops, and liberated the capital of their country, Rome, from under the Nazi jackboot. How can Italian patriots not feel proud of this glorious page and feel it is worth commemorating forever?

    However, the Mayor of Rome, a Christian Democrat named Cioccetti, had different ideas, unreasonably opposing the demands of the Communist and Socialist Parties. He said he did not want to do so because, in his view, looking back at the defeat of the fascists meant "stirring up hatred and reopening sealed wounds."

    What does this Christian Democrat mayor mean by "stirring up hatred"? Is it "stirring up" the people's hatred of the fascists, or stirring up the fascists' hatred of the people? If it is the former, what is wrong with that? Should the people sympathize with the fascists? Obviously, this mayor does not want the people to remember the hatred of the fascists, but is afraid that the people will rise up to hate the fascists.

    As for "reopening sealed wounds," that depends on the situation. Scars that have healed are not necessarily completely healed. Don't you see that in today's West Germany, Nazi fascist bacteria are multiplying and growing in large numbers within this wound. Pricking this scar and fighting bacteria is a good treatment. This mayor is afraid of piercing this abscess, fearing that it will affect the breeding ground for fascist bacteria.

    In the past, Mussolini found an ally in Hitler; but now West German militarism can find sympathizers from the likes of the Mayor of Rome.

    市长的心肠
    今年6月4日是罗马从希特勒占领下解放出来十五周年的纪念日。意大利共产党和社会党等都要求罗马市政府采取措施来纪念这个意义重大的日子。
    每一个意大利爱国者都会记得，十五年前当法西斯德国残酷统治意大利期间，意大利人民遭受了多么沉重的灾难。意大利爱国者为了争取祖国的自由曾经拿起武器，跟法西斯德国和意大利反动政府进行了艰苦的斗争。他们亲手惩罚意大利的罪魁墨索里尼，驱逐了纳粹军队，把祖国的首都罗马从纳粹铁蹄下解放了出来。意大利的爱国者怎能不为这光荣的一页而感到骄傲、值得永远纪念呢？
    但是罗马市市长、天主教民主党人乔切蒂亚的心思却不一样，他竟无理反对共产党和社会党的要求。他说，他不希望这样做，因为在他看来，回顾法西斯分子的失败就意味着“煽动仇恨和戳破封口的伤疤。”
    这位天主教民主党市长的所谓“煽动仇恨”是什么意思呢？是“煽动”人民对法西斯的仇恨，还是煽动法西斯对人民的仇恨呢？如果是前者，那有什么不好呢？难道还要人民去同情法西斯吗？显然，这位市长不是要人民记取法西斯的仇恨，而是害怕人民起来仇恨法西斯的。
    至于“戳破封口的伤疤”，那也得看什么情况。伤疤封了口不等于完全痊愈。君不见在今天德国西部的这个伤口里，纳粹法西斯细菌正在大量繁殖、滋长起来。把这种伤疤戳穿，跟细菌作斗争那倒是一种良好的治疗。这位市长正是害怕戳破这个脓疮，唯恐影响了法西斯细菌的温床。
    在过去，墨索里尼在希特勒那里找到了盟主；而今西德军国主义却可以从罗马市长之流那里找到了同情者了。
