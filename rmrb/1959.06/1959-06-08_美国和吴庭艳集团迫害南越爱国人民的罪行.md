    The relevant Geneva Accords on Vietnam stipulate: both sides of the ceasefire "undertake to refrain from any reprisals or discrimination against persons or organizations on account of their activities during the hostilities and to guarantee their democratic freedoms." The Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference also stipulates: "The settlement of political problems, effected on the basis of respect for the principles of independence, unity and territorial integrity, shall permit the Vietnamese people to enjoy the fundamental freedoms, guaranteed by democratic institutions established as a result of free general elections by secret ballot"; and that "peace has been sufficiently restored" and "all necessary conditions for free expression of the national will have been met." These provisions clearly guarantee the democratic freedoms of former resistance members and the freedom of will of the Vietnamese patriotic people to demand peaceful reunification of their country.
    However, since the restoration of peace in Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam, instigated by US imperialism, has seriously violated these provisions of the Geneva Accords. They have used fascist terror tactics to massacre, torture, and arrest former resistance members and other patriots on a large scale. Since the beginning of this year, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has intensified its bloody persecution and slaughter of patriotic people and former resistance members who support the Geneva Accords and demand the peaceful reunification of their country. According to incomplete statistics, from the restoration of peace in July 1954 to February 1959, the South Vietnamese authorities had already manufactured thousands of persecution incidents in violation of the Geneva Accords, resulting in the death or disappearance of 4,971 people, injuries to 10,185 people, and the arrest and imprisonment of 180,843 people.
    The crimes of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in persecuting the patriotic people of South Vietnam are countless. For example, in the Zuo De incident in Quang Nam Province in September 1950, twenty-one people were buried alive; in the Wei Chuan incident in January 1955, forty-seven people were severely tortured and then drowned in the river at night; in the Xiang Tian incident in July of the same year, ninety-two people (including thirty-one children and thirty-two women) were killed, and two villages were razed to the ground. Even more inhumane was the Chen Shili incident in July 1955 (a young woman from a poor peasant family in Quang Nam Province). Simply because she had participated in the resistance war in the past and had requested the International Commission to implement the provisions of the Geneva Accords in order to achieve the unification of Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities arrested her and used electric shocks and red-hot tongs to burn her breasts, genitals, and muscles. In addition, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime also formulated various laws and regulations to stifle democratic freedoms and rights, and widely established Hitler-style concentration camps under the names of "Anti-Communist Study Classes" and "Training Centers" to persecute former resistance members and patriots. In December 1958, the Phu Loi concentration camp massacre occurred. South Vietnamese special agents used poison to brutally kill more than 1,000 political prisoners (mostly former resistance members) in one fell swoop, and poisoned more than 4,000 people. This is the most shocking political massacre case in the world today.
    The so-called military "sweeps" that are constantly being carried out in many provinces of South Vietnam are another bloody crime committed by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to suppress the patriotic people of South Vietnam. According to the statistics of the South Vietnamese authorities at the "Four Years of Achievements" exhibition, in the two years of 1956 and 1957 alone, there were the so-called "Nguyen Hue Campaign," "Rui Yu Hou Campaign," and "Zhang Jinbao Campaign," in which a total of 1,224 people were killed, 63 were injured, and 4,004 were arrested. Since 1958, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has continued to carry out the second phase of the so-called "Anti-Communist Movement" and expanded the "sweep" areas. For example, the Tuan Yu Hua campaign in the Fifth Interzone, the Chen Hongbao campaign in the Western Highlands, the Nguyen Chiem campaign in the southeastern part of the South, the Bei Ai campaign in Ba Chuan in the South, and the "Appeal to Communism" campaign in the "Construction" of rural areas in Dinh Tuong area in the South, all massacred many patriotic people. Later, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique intensified its military "sweeps" in Di Shi, Jin Ou, He Xian and other places. From February 1959 to the present, the South Vietnamese authorities have been carrying out large-scale military
  "sweeps" against the people in the former resistance base area "D Zone" of the Vietnam People's Army. In this "sweep," Ngo Dinh Diem dispatched 15,000 regular troops, including three battalions of infantry, four battalions of paratroopers, one battalion of artillery, two companies of the "Presidential Palace" guard troops, one company of commandos, and even dispatched aircraft to bomb unarmed people. Currently, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are further expanding the "sweeps" against local residents in the eastern and western regions of Vietnam.
    While the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is stepping up its persecution of the South Vietnamese people and carrying out military "sweeps," the South Vietnamese authorities further promulgated the so-called "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" on May 6. This is a thorough and complete fascist ordinance and another frantic attack by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique on former resistance members and patriots in South Vietnam. Article 6 of "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" stipulates that three "Special Military Courts" be established in Saigon, Ban Me Thuot, and Hue in South Vietnam. These three courts can conduct activities throughout South Vietnam, and if deemed necessary, other temporary on-the-spot judgment or mobile "Special Military Courts" can be added. According to Articles 1 and 2 of the ordinance, the so-called "Special Military Court" is for punishing "criminals" who the Ngo Dinh Diem clique believes "have destructive purposes" or "violate foreign or domestic security," and whether they are completed offenses or have "ideologies" of violating the law, they will be punished. Article 12 of "Ordinance No. 10" also stipulates that so-called "criminals" can be sentenced without interrogation or investigation, as long as the Minister and Deputy Minister of National Defense of South Vietnam order it, the "Special Military Court" can open the trial within three days, and the sentenced person does not have any right to appeal. The judgments of the "Special Military Court" are only death penalty and life imprisonment, and once sentenced, there can be no commutation. These clauses nakedly expose the South Vietnamese authorities' sinister conspiracy to step up the persecution of former resistance members and all patriotic people in South Vietnam.
    The purpose of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique stepping up their implementation of terrorist rule in South Vietnam is to suppress all the wishes of the South Vietnamese people for peaceful reunification of their motherland and to completely tear up the Geneva Accords in order to completely turn South Vietnam into a US military base and colony.
    In fact, since the signing of the Geneva Accords, US military personnel and war materials have poured into South Vietnam in large quantities, and the United States has built and expanded military bases in South Vietnam on a large scale; the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has acted entirely at the behest of US imperialism, ignoring any provisions of the Geneva Accords. The US military advisory group in South Vietnam has manipulated the formulation and implementation of South Vietnamese military plans, becoming the supreme command of the South Vietnamese army. The number of this advisory group has increased from 200 at the time of the restoration of peace to about 2,000, including as many as 280 senior officers. In the so-called "sweep" campaigns such as Rui Yu Hou and Zhang Jinbao, the US military directly commanded. More than 100 US military advisors participated in the He Xian and Di Shi "sweeps" from December 1958 to February this year. In the past few years, the United States has illegally transported weapons and war materials to South Vietnam more than 300 times, with an average weight of 100 tons of war materials transported each time, and a maximum of 1,000 tons. The work of expanding and building new military bases by the United States in South Vietnam is being stepped up.
    Before the ceasefire, South Vietnam had only six military airports, but now it has increased to more than 20, six of which are exclusively for military jet aircraft. The highway from Saigon to Bien Hoa is 30 kilometers long and 100 meters wide, which is actually a strategic highway; at the same time, open spaces of 950 meters wide are left on both sides of the highway, which is clearly to establish a giant military airport. In addition, Ban Me Thuot in the Da Lat Plateau has also decided to be built into a large land and air force base and a command post for military activities. Before the ceasefire, South Vietnam had only two naval bases, Saigon and Da Nang, that were not fully equipped, and one Nha Trang port. Now, the United States is expanding military facilities in Saigon and Da Nang, making Saigon able to handle 10,000-ton warships day and night; at the same time, it has built Nha Trang, Tu Lon, Quy Nhon, Cam Ninh, Nha?, and other places into new naval bases, and is also planning to transform Cam Ranh Bay into a submarine base. At the same time, the US-Ngo clique is opening up a series of strategic highways and their branches, preparing to open up a strategic highway from Quy Nhon to Ba Se in Laos, so as to connect the strategic highways of South Vietnam and Thailand into a system through Laos. In addition, the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have also established 50 military bases called "Reclamation Zones."
    In early April of this year, US President Eisenhower, in his speech at Gettysburg College, particularly emphasized the importance of South Vietnam's "national interests" and its "strategic" position to the United States. This shows that US imperialism is attempting to further use South Vietnam as a springboard for its aggression against the entire Indochina. As everyone can see, in the recent US conspiracy plans to invade Laos and subvert Cambodia, South Vietnam has increasingly clearly acted as a shameful pawn of the US aggressors, just like Thailand in the Southeast Asian aggression group.
    At present, while the United States is instigating the pro-American government of Laos to tear up the Geneva Accords and launch a civil war, it is inciting the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to step up fascist terror rule in South Vietnam and adopt large-scale persecution and armed suppression against the South Vietnamese people. This is precisely a part of the US imperialist conspiracy plan to launch aggression and sabotage peace in the entire Indochina. US newspapers and news publications have repeatedly proposed the establishment of a so-called "economic and cultural" alliance including South Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, the Philippines, etc., attempting to find some other forms to drag South Vietnam into an aggressive military alliance. Saigon newspapers have also openly clamored for "openly advocating" the so-called "other forms of alliance besides the Southeast Asian League." Recently, when the Ngo Dinh Diem clique carried out large-scale military "sweeps" in South Vietnam and the Lao Sananikone government comprehensively tore up the Geneva Accords and brazenly launched a civil war, senior officials of South Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand conducted frequent contacts and mutual visits, which was to pave the way for the conspiracy to realize the US-planned trilateral military alliance between South Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. US imperialism is attempting to make South Vietnam and Laos de facto members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization through the establishment of this military alliance. If this conspiracy plan of US imperialism succeeds, the peace of Indochina and the Far East will face an even more serious crisis.
    However, the crimes of US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in intensifying terrorist rule in South Vietnam and undermining the Geneva Accords have aroused great indignation among the Vietnamese people, especially the South Vietnamese people, and have been strongly opposed by the peace forces all over the world. With the sympathy and support of the peace forces all over the world, the heroic Vietnamese people will eventually smash the anti-peace conspiracy of US imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and win the complete victory in defending the peace of Vietnam and the entire Indochina and striving for the independence and unification of the motherland.

    美国和吴庭艳集团迫害南越爱国人民的罪行
    金容
    有关越南的日内瓦协议规定：停战双方“保证不得对任何人和团体因其在战时的活动而加以任何报复和歧视，并保证他们的民主自由”。日内瓦会议的最后宣言中也规定：“在尊重独立、统一和领土完整的原则的基础上对各项政治问题的解决，应使越南人民享有经由秘密投票的自由普选而建立的民主机构所保证的基本自由”；并且在“使和平的恢复得到足够的进展”，“使自由表现民族意志的一切必要条件得以具备”。这些规定，明白地保障了越南前抗战人员的民主自由权利和越南爱国人民要求祖国和平统一的自由意志。
    但是，自从越南和平恢复以来，南越吴庭艳集团在美帝国主义的唆使下，严重违反日内瓦协议的这些规定，用法西斯恐怖统治的手段，大规模杀戮、残害和逮捕前抗战人员及其他爱国人士。今年以来，吴庭艳集团更变本加厉，对凡是拥护日内瓦协议、要求祖国和平统一的爱国人民及前抗战人员进行血腥的迫害和屠杀。据不完全统计，从1954年7月和平恢复到1959年2月为止，南越当局已制造了数以千计的违反日内瓦协议的迫害事件，有四千九百七十一人死亡或失踪，一万零一百八十五人受伤和十八万零八百四十三人被捕和监禁。
    吴庭艳集团对南越爱国人民的迫害罪行，是罄竹难书的。例如：1950年9月广南省佐德事件，有二十一人被活埋；1955年1月维川事件，四十七人遭到严刑拷打。并于夜里被沉入河中淹死；同年7月向田事件，九十二人（其中三十一个孩子，三十二名妇女）被杀，两个村庄被铲平。更为灭绝人性的是，1955年7月陈氏李（广南省一个贫农家庭的女青年）事件，只因她过去曾参加过抗战和她曾要求国际委员会履行日内瓦协议各项条款，以便实现越南的统一，吴庭艳当局就逮捕了她，用电器和烧红的铁钳刺烫她的乳房、阴部和肌肉。此外，吴庭艳政权还制定了各种扼杀民主自由权利的法令和条例，以“控共学习班”和“训练中心”等名义广设希特勒式的集中营，以迫害前抗战人员和爱国者。1958年12月发生了富利集中营惨案，南越的特务人员用毒药一次就惨杀了一千多名政治犯（大部分是前抗战人员），并使四千多人中毒，这是今天世界上最骇人听闻的政治惨杀案件。
    在南越许多省不断进行的所谓军事“扫荡”，是吴庭艳集团镇压南越爱国人民的又一种血腥罪行。根据南越当局在“四年政绩”展览会上的统计，仅1956、1957两年内就有所谓“阮惠战役”、“瑞玉侯战役”、“张进宝战役”，共有一千二百二十四人被杀害，六十三人受伤，四千零四人被捕。自1958年以来，吴庭艳集团继续开展了第二阶段的所谓“控共运动”，扩大了“扫荡”地区。例如在第五联区的团玉话战役，在西原地区的陈红保战役，在南部东面地区阮荐战役，在南部巴川的北爱战役，在南部定祥地区“建设”农村的“诉共”战役等，屠杀了许多爱国人民。以后吴庭艳集团又在迪石、金瓯、河仙等地加紧军事“扫荡”。从1959年2月一直到现在，南越当局向越南人民军前抗战根据地“D战区”的人民进行着大规模的军事
  “扫荡”。在这次“扫荡”中，吴庭艳出动了一万五千名正规部队，其中包括三营步兵，四营伞兵，一营炮兵，两连“总统府”警卫部队，一连别动队，甚至出动了飞机轰炸手无寸铁的人民。目前，吴庭艳当局正在进一步扩大在越南东部和西部地区对当地居民的“扫荡”。
    在吴庭艳集团加紧对南越人民进行迫害和军事“扫荡”的同时，南越当局更在5月6日颁布了所谓“1959年十号法令”。这是一个彻头彻尾的法西斯法令，是吴庭艳集团向南越前抗战人员和爱国人士的又一次疯狂进攻。“1959年十号法令”第六条规定：在南越的西贡、邦美蜀和顺化设立三个“特别军事法庭”。这三个法庭可以在南越全境巡回进行活动，并且在认为必要时，还可以增设其他临时性的当场判决或流动的“特别军事法庭”。据法令第一条和第二条说，所谓“特别军事法庭”，是为了惩办吴庭艳集团认为“具有破坏目的”或“侵犯国外或国内安全”的“罪犯”，并且不管已遂犯或有犯法“思想”者都要受到惩处。“十号法令”第十二条还规定，对所谓“犯罪者”可以无须进行审讯和查究，只要南越国防部正、副部长下令，“特别军事法庭”就可以在三天内开庭判决，而且被判刑者还没有任何上诉的权利。“特别军事法庭”的判决只有死刑和无期苦刑两种，一经判决就不能有任何减刑。这些条款赤裸裸地暴露了南越当局加紧迫害南越前抗战人员和一切爱国人民的恶毒阴谋。
    美国和吴庭艳集团加紧在南越推行恐怖统治，其目的是为了镇压南越人民和平统一祖国的一切愿望，彻底撕毁日内瓦协议，以便把南越完完全全地变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。
    事实上，自从日内瓦协议签订以来，美国军事人员和作战物资大量涌入南越，美国在南越大规模地修建和扩建军事基地；吴庭艳集团完全仰美帝国主义的鼻息行事，而无视日内瓦协议的任何条款。在南越的美国军事顾问团操纵了南越军事计划的制订和执行，成为南越军队的最高指挥部。这个顾问团的人数已从和平恢复时的二百名增加到二千名左右，其中高级军官就有二百八十名之多。在瑞玉侯和张进宝等所谓“扫荡”战役中，美国军队直接进行了指挥。在1958年12月至今年2月的河仙、迪石“扫荡”中就有一百多名美国军事顾问参加。几年以来，美国已经三百多次把武器和作战物资非法运入南越，平均每次运入战争物资的重量有一百吨，最高达到一千吨。美国在南越扩建和新建军事基地的工作正在加紧进行。
    停战以前，南越只有六个军用机场，而现在已增加到二十多个，其中有六个专供军事喷气式飞机使用。西贡到边和的公路长三十公里，路面宽一百公尺，实际上这是一条战略公路；同时在公路两边又各留出旷地宽九百五十公尺，这显然是为了建立一个巨型的军用机场。此外，多乐高原的邦美蜀也决定修建成为一个陆、空军大基地和军事活动的指挥部。停战以前，南越只有西贡和岘港两个没有全部装备好的海军基地和一个芽庄停靠港。现在美国一面在西贡、岘港扩建军事设备，使西贡可以日夜吞吐万吨级战舰；同时又把芽庄、土伦、归仁、甘宁、牙?等地修建成为新的海军基地，并且还筹划把金兰湾改建为潜艇基地。与此同时，美吴集团正在开辟一系列的战略公路和它的支线，准备从归仁到老挝的百细开辟一条战略公路，以便通过老挝把南越和泰国的战略公路连接成一个系统。另外，美国和吴庭艳集团还建立了五十个名为“垦荒区”的军事基地。
    今年4月初，美国总统艾森豪威尔在葛底斯堡学院的演说中，特别强调南越对于美国的“民族利益”和它的“战略”地位的重要性。这就表明了美帝国主义企图更进一步把南越作为它侵略整个印度支那的跳板。谁都看到，在最近美国侵略老挝和颠覆柬埔寨的阴谋计划中，南越已日益明显地和东南亚侵略集团的泰国一样，充当了美国侵略者的可耻的走卒。
    目前美国在策动老挝亲美政府撕毁日内瓦协议、发动内战的同时，唆使吴庭艳集团在南越加紧法西斯恐怖统治，对南越人民采取大规模的迫害和武力镇压手段，正是美帝国主义在整个印度支那发动侵略与破坏和平的阴谋计划的一个部分。美国报纸和新闻刊物曾多次提出要成立一个包括南越、老挝、泰国、菲律宾等国的所谓“经济文化”联盟，企图寻找一些其他的形式把南越拖入一个侵略性的军事联盟。西贡报纸也公开叫嚣“应公开赞成”所谓“除东南亚联盟形式以外的其他联盟形式”。最近当吴庭艳集团在南越进行大规模军事“扫荡”和老挝萨纳尼空政府全面撕毁日内瓦协议、悍然发动内战的时候，南越、老挝和泰国的高级官方人士进行了频繁的接触和相互访问，就是为实现美国所策划的南越、老挝和泰国三边军事联盟的阴谋铺平道路。美帝国主义企图通过这个军事联盟的建立，使南越和老挝变成东南亚条约集团的事实上的成员国。美帝国主义的这一阴谋计划如果得逞，那么，印度支那及远东的和平势将发生更加严重的危机。
    但是，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团在南越加紧恐怖统治，破坏日内瓦协议的罪行，已经激起了越南人民，特别是南越人民巨大的愤慨，并遭到了全世界和平力量的强烈反对。英勇的越南人民在全世界和平力量的同情和支持下，终将粉碎美帝国主义和它的走卒吴庭艳集团的反和平阴谋，而赢得保卫越南和整个印度支那和平，争取祖国独立和统一事业的彻底胜利。（附图片）
    几年过去了，陈氏李依然还须留在医院里治疗吴庭艳集团的毒害的伤痕。
