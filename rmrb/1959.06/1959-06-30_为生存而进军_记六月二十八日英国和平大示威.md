    Marching for Survival
    ——A Record of the British Peace Demonstration on June 28th
    By Our Correspondent Su Lan
    "I will replace weeping with laughter, I will fight to the last moment of my life..."
    The voice of the black singer Paul Robeson resounded throughout Trafalgar Square. His magnificent body stood on the platform, like a statue. The more than 20,000 people in the square initially listened quietly, then joined in singing in unison. The excited emotions of hundreds of thousands of people, like countless rivers, converged into a surging ocean, impacting, boiling, and heading towards one goal - peace! Ban the atomic bomb! Convene a summit conference! Oppose the rearmament of West Germany!
    It was 5:00 PM, and the rally was nearing its end, but streams of people were still pouring into the square. This was one of the largest peace demonstrations in Britain since the war: the "Demonstration for Survival." From 11:00 AM, people began to gather in Hyde Park. Mothers came pushing prams, they were there to protect their children. Miners from Scotland and Wales, who not long ago were still holding their posts in underground tunnels to prevent the closure of the mines, today marched into Hyde Park holding placards against war. The struggle to protect life and the struggle to protect peace were closely intertwined. Veterans who fought against the Nazi army more than a decade ago came to participate in today's demonstration with excitement, they were unwilling to see their enemies armed with American atomic bombs. Residents of the Stepney district of London came to participate in the march, old and young. In the last war, the last German "V-2" missile exploded here. From the Southwark district on the south bank of the Thames came dockworkers and transport workers. Nazi bombs took the lives of more than a thousand people in this district, including three hundred children... The marching crowds surged towards Trafalgar Square like a torrent. The sides of the street were lined with layers upon layers of people, like two dikes. Marches were played in the procession. From the crowds on both sides came constant applause. At this moment, many spectators joined the march, moving forward in unison. In the face of such a magnificent procession, the police following the crowds here and there looked like a flock of startled black crows.
    In the marching column, an eye-catching banner attracted people's attention. On this banner were painted four bombs, with the words "Tear Down Missile Bases." These were people from the East Anglia region. In this small area, four American air bases (one of which has become a missile base), like four nails hammered into people's hearts, made them worried and uneasy day and night. Since the establishment of the missile bases, people there have been protesting and demonstrating in front of the bases almost every day.
    Scottish workers marched to the accompaniment of bagpipes. Just a few days ago, this region planned to send three hundred representatives to participate in this demonstration. Today, there are not three hundred, but more than five hundred. They represent more than 90,000 coal miners, shipbuilders, and machinists... It was these people, some taking out a few shillings from their pockets, others a few pennies, who put together more than a thousand pounds for travel expenses to send their representatives to London.
    After the rally began at 3:00 PM, the square became a sea of people. These more than 20,000 people brought the wishes of the broad masses of the British people who demanded peace and relaxation of the international situation. Supporting this rally were celebrities from all walks of life in Britain, including famous scientists, writers, poets, trade union leaders, Labor Party members of parliament, university professors, actors, pacifists, chess champions, and others. The various trade unions and organizations that sponsored this rally had more than two million members. Lenin Peace Prize winner and famous British peace activist Montague said at the end of the conference: In Britain, there are tens of millions of people who want peace; only a handful want to continue the Cold War!

    为生存而进军
    ——记六月二十八日英国和平大示威
    本报记者　苏蓝
    “我用欢笑代替哭泣，我将战斗到生命的最后一刻……”
    黑人歌王罗伯逊的歌声响彻了特拉法加广场。他那魁伟的身躯，站在主席台上，宛如一座雕像。广场上二万多群众，开始是静静地谛听，继而合声齐唱。成千上万人的激动的感情，像无数条河流汇成了澎湃汹涌的汪洋大海，冲击着、沸腾着，奔向一个目标——和平！禁止原子弹！召开首脑会议！反对重新武装西德！
    下午五点钟了，大会已经接近了尾声，但开会队伍仍不断涌进广场，这是英国战后以来规模最大的和平大示威之一：“争取生存示威游行”。从上午十一点起，人们开始向海德公园汇聚。母亲们推着婴儿车来了，她们是为了保卫自己的孩子。来自苏格兰和威尔士的矿工，不久以前，他们还在地下坑道中坚守岗位不准矿井关闭，今天，他们又举着反对战争的标语牌走进了海德公园。保卫生活的斗争和保卫和平的斗争，紧密地交织在一起。十多年前同纳粹军队作过战的退伍军人，怀着激动的心情来参加今天的示威，他们不愿意看到自己的敌人用美国的原子弹武装起来。伦敦斯坦伯尼区的居民们，扶老携幼地来参加游行。在上次大战中，德国最后一颗“V—2”飞弹，就是在这儿爆炸的。从泰晤士河南岸南瓦克区来的有码头工人和运输工人，纳粹的炸弹在这个区里夺去了一千多人的生命，其中包括三百个儿童……。游行队伍像一道洪流，涌向特拉法加广场。街道两旁站满了一层又一层的群众，好似两道堤坝。队伍中奏起进行曲。从两侧人群中传来的是不断的掌声。就在这时，不少观众加入了游行行列，齐步前进。在这么一支雄伟的队伍面前，零零落落跟着群众屁股转的警察，像一群被惊散了的黑乌鸦。
    在游行队伍中，一幅醒目的标语引起了人们的注意。在这块标语牌上，画着四个炸弹，上面写着“拔掉导弹基地”。这是来自东安格里区的人们。就在这个小小的地区，美国的四个空军基地（其中有一个已成为导弹基地），像四棵钉在人们心上的钉子，使他们日夜忧虑和不安。自从导弹基地建立以来，那里的人们几乎每天都到基地门前抗议、示威。
    苏格兰的工人们在“风笛”的伴奏下前进。还在几天之前，这个地区就打算派三百名代表来参加这次示威。今天，他们来的已不是三百人，而是五百多人。他们代表着九万多煤矿工人、造船工人和机械工人……。就是这些人，从他们的口袋里有的掏出几个先令，有的拿出几个便士，凑成了一千多英镑的路费，把他们的代表送到伦敦来。
    大会在下午三点钟开始后，广场变成了人海。这二万多人带来了全英国广大人民要求和平、要求国际局势缓和的心愿。支持这次大会的有英国各界名流，其中包括著名科学家、作家、诗人、工会领袖、工党议员、大学教授、演员、和平主义者、象棋冠军等。赞助这次大会的各个工会和社团，拥有二百多万成员。列宁和平奖金获得者、英国著名和平人士蒙塔古在大会结束时说：在英国，要求和平的人是千千万万；想继续冷战的，只是屈指可数的一小撮！
