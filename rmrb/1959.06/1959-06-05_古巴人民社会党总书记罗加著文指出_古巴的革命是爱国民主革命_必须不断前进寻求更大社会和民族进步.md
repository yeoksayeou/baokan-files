    This newspaper reports that the American "Workers' Weekly" published an article on May 31 by Roca, General Secretary of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba, entitled "What is the Nature of the Cuban Revolution?" The article elaborates on the basic tasks of the Cuban Revolution at the present stage and the nature of the Cuban Revolution.
    In discussing the nature of the Cuban Revolution, Comrade Roca pointed out that to determine the nature of a revolution, one must first and foremost consider its basic tasks, the economic, political, and social content of the historical tasks it solves or intends to solve. He said that at the present stage there are four basic historical tasks: 1. Complete national independence and sovereignty; 2. Carrying out land reform to end the large estate system and other feudal remnants, and distributing land to peasants; 3. Developing the economy on an independent basis (restoring national wealth, state control of the economy, establishing new relations with foreign markets, eliminating single-crop farming, developing diversified production, etc.), because this is the foundation and guarantee of political independence; 4. Expanding and deepening democracy to give it more real content (allowing people and workers to enjoy democratic rights, eliminating racial discrimination, carrying out a cultural revolution, eliminating electoral fraud and deception, etc.). The article then pointed out, "The revolution is currently solving or trying to solve these tasks. Therefore, regarding the question of what kind of nature this revolution belongs to, we can answer that this is a patriotic democratic revolution, a national liberation revolution, and a land revolution. At the present stage, this is not a socialist revolution."
    The article said, "If we not only consider the economic, political, and social content of the basic tasks of the revolution, but also consider the forces that promote this revolution, the class and social forces that determine, realize, and promote the revolution, as well as the rhythm and depth of the revolution's development, then I would say that this is an advanced people's revolution. I say 'people's' because this is a revolution of all classes of the people, including peasants, workers, the petty bourgeoisie of the middle class, and the bourgeoisie. The main component of the revolutionary army is peasants and agricultural workers. The officers in the army also come from these classes, from the petty bourgeoisie and workers."
    The article concluded, "This revolution will continue to advance, must continue to advance, must maintain its own rhythm, and, at the appropriate time, must transition to the next stage to seek greater social and national progress."

    古巴人民社会党总书记罗加著文指出
    古巴的革命是爱国民主革命
    必须不断前进寻求更大社会和民族进步
    本报讯　5月31日出版的一期美国“工人周报”发表了古巴人民社会党总书记罗加题为“古巴革命的性质是什么”的文章，详细阐述了古巴革命在目前阶段的基本任务和古巴革命的性质。
    罗加同志在论述古巴革命性质的时候指出，要确定一个革命性质，必须首先和主要加以考虑的是它的基本任务，它所解决的或者打算解决的历史任务中的经济、政治和社会内容。他说，在目前阶段有四项基本历史任务：一、国家的完全独立和主权；二、进行土地改革以结束大庄园制度和其他封建残余，并把土地分配给农民；三、在独立的基础上发展经济（恢复国民财富，由国家控制经济，同国外市场建立新的关系，消除单一作物制，发展多种生产等等），因为这是政治独立的基础和保证；四、扩大和加深民主，使它具有更为真实的内容（让人民和工人享受民主权利，消除种族歧视，进行文化革命，消除选举中的舞弊和欺骗等等）。文章接着指出，“革命目前正在解决或正在设法解决这些任务。因此，对于这次革命究竟属于何种性质的问题，我们可以回答说，这是一次爱国民主革命、民族解放革命、土地革命。在目前阶段，这不是社会主义革命。”
    文章说，“如果我们不仅仅考虑到革命的基本任务的经济、政治和社会内容，而同时也考虑到推动这个革命的力量，考虑到决定、实现和促进革命的阶级和社会力量以及革命发展的节奏和深度，那么我要说，这是一个先进的人民革命。我所以说是‘人民的’，那是因为这是人民大众各阶级的革命，包括农民、工人、中间阶层的小资产阶级和资产阶级。参加革命军的人的主要成份是农民和农业工人。部队中的军官也来自这些阶层，来自小资产阶级和工人。”
    文章最后指出，“这个革命将不断前进，必须不断前进，必须保持自己的节奏，并且在适当的时候，必须过渡到下一个阶段，来寻求更大的社会和民族进步。”
