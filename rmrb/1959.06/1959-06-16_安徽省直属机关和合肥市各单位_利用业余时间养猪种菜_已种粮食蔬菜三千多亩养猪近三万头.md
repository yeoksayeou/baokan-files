Anhui Province Directly Subordinate Organs and Hefei City Units
    Utilize Spare Time to Raise Pigs and Grow Vegetables
    Having Planted More Than 3,000 Mu of Grain and Vegetables and Raised Nearly 30,000 Pigs
    (本报讯)This newspaper reports that the organs, factories, and schools directly under Anhui Province and Hefei City are making full use of all vacant land and spare time to carry out agricultural and sideline production such as growing vegetables and raising pigs, and have already achieved results.
    The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has always attached importance to the development of spare-time production by cadres in organs. Since the beginning of this year, the Provincial Committee has been paying even closer attention to this work. In addition to giving written instructions, it also mobilized cadres at a meeting of organs directly under the province. Each system and unit held meetings from top to bottom to arrange production tasks and formulate production plans. Each unit established a production management committee with the participation of the main responsible comrades of the unit, and production groups were formed under it. In production, all organs adopted the method of unified management and division of responsibility, established a responsibility system, and specifically arranged production tasks to groups, assigning responsibility to individuals, so production developed very rapidly. According to statistics from the Hefei Municipal Committee and the Party Committee directly under the province, as of now, the city has planted 1,400 mu of grain crops, 1,870 mu of vegetables and melons, raised 29,300 pigs, 43,500 poultry of various kinds, and more than 4.3 million fish. The production activities of various organs have formed a high tide of everyone participating and striving to be the first, and people's enthusiasm for production is extremely high. Under the leadership of Director Peng Lichang, the cadres of the Meteorological Bureau have planted all the arable land with various vegetables and grain crops and earnestly strengthened management. The Provincial Department of Commerce system has planted more than 400 mu of land and raised 783 pigs. The workers of the East District Wood Factory used holidays and spare time to plant all 26 mu of vacant land and wasteland with rice, soybeans, and vegetables in a few days. Encouraged by the cadres' enthusiasm for production, the families and nannies of various organs and factories also spontaneously organized to grow vegetables, raise pigs, and raise poultry.
    In production, all units promptly adopted various measures to solve problems in production. In order to solve the problem of insufficient pig feed, the Provincial Party Committee General Office, which has already raised 1,200 pigs, recently planted eight mu of high-yielding Sichuan cowhide vegetables; many units such as Hefei No. 2 Middle School and the Provincial Meteorological Bureau used spare time to go out to cut pig grass.
    Now, it has become a conscious habit for people in various organs to participate in agricultural and sideline production labor. Whenever there is work left or on holidays, groups of cadres can be seen working in the fields. The vegetables produced by the Provincial Meteorological Bureau, Forestry School, and Middle School Teachers' Advanced Training College have reached total self-sufficiency; some of the vegetables produced by some units are also supplied to the market.
    In addition, this newspaper reports that teachers and students in secondary schools in various parts of Anhui Province have generally used their spare time to carry out production activities such as raising pigs and growing vegetables.

    安徽省直属机关和合肥市各单位
    利用业余时间养猪种菜
    已种粮食蔬菜三千多亩养猪近三万头
    本报讯　安徽省直属机关和合肥市各机关、工厂、学校，充分利用一切空地和业余时间进行种菜、养猪等农副业生产，已经取得了成绩。
    中共安徽省委对机关干部开展业余生产一向重视。今年以来，省委对这项工作抓得更紧，除专门作文字指示外，并在省直属机关的干部会上作了动员。各系统各单位从上到下都召开了会议，布置生产任务，制订生产计划。各个单位都成立了有本机关主要负责同志参加的生产管理委员会，下面成立了生产小组。在生产中，各机关都采取了统一管理、分片包干的办法，建立了责任制度，将生产任务具体安排到组，责任包到个人，因而生产发展得很迅速。据合肥市委和省直属党委统计，到目前止，全市已种粮食作物一千四百亩，蔬菜瓜类一千八百七十亩，养猪二万九千三百头，养各种家禽四万三千五百只，养鱼四百三十多万尾。各个机关的生产活动已经形成了人人动手、个个争先的热潮，人们的生产热情极为高涨。气象局的干部在局长彭利昌同志的带动下，已把全部能种的地种上了各种蔬菜和粮食作物，并认真加强管理。省商业厅系统已种地四百多亩，养猪七百八十三头。东市区木器厂的工人利用假日和业余时间，在几天内便把二十六亩空地和荒地全部种上了水稻、黄豆、蔬菜。在干部生产热情的鼓舞下，各机关、工厂的家属、保姆也自动组织起来，种菜、养猪和养家禽。
    各单位在生产中，及时采取了各种措施，解决生产中的问题。为了解决猪饲料不足问题，已养猪一千二百头的省委办公厅，新近种了八亩产量很高的四川牛皮菜；合肥二中、省气象局等许多单位的人员利用业余时间外出打猪草。
    现在，各机关人员参加农副业生产劳动已经养成了自觉习惯。每当工余或假日，可以看到成群结队的干部在地里劳动。省气象局、林业学校、中学教师进修学院等单位生产的蔬菜已达到全部自给；部分单位生产的蔬菜还有一部分供应市场需要。
    又讯　安徽省各地中等学校师生，普遍利用业余时间开展了养猪、种菜等生产活动。
