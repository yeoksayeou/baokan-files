Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 26th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement strongly condemning the so-called cooperation agreement signed between the Phoui Sananikone government and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities.

The statement said that while the Phoui Sananikone government was provoking civil war in Laos, it signed a so-called cooperation agreement with the South Vietnamese authorities on May 20. According to reports from foreign news agencies and newspapers in Laos and South Vietnam, the content of the above-mentioned agreement includes noteworthy issues such as "border regulations," "judicial cooperation in suppressing rebellions," "residency," "civil and military cooperation," and "transportation lines from the two ports of Saigon and Tourane to Laos."

The statement pointed out that the above-mentioned agreement concluded between Laos and South Vietnam is essentially a new military alliance organized under the planning of US imperialism, and is a further collusion between two regions declared to be under the so-called "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. This behavior seriously violates the Geneva Accords on Indochina.

The statement pointed out that the above-mentioned agreement between Laos and South Vietnam is a manifestation of further collusion in many aspects, especially in the military field, between the Kingdom of Laos government and the South Vietnamese authorities, according to the war preparation plan of US imperialism.

The statement then revealed various facts of military collusion between the Kingdom of Laos government and the South Vietnamese authorities in recent years. The statement said that, especially since the Phoui Sananikone government came to power, the above-mentioned military collusion activities have become more frequent.

The statement said that this proves that the Kingdom of Laos government and the South Vietnamese authorities are further intensifying their collusion in the military field, according to the overall plan of US imperialism to strengthen its interference in Laos and South Vietnam, turn Laos and South Vietnam into military bases, and prepare to launch a war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The statement said that the so-called "border" agreement in the cooperation agreement signed between the Lao government and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is to allow the troops and police of Laos and South Vietnam to further cooperate in suppressing the patriots of Laos and South Vietnam - the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and Vietnamese former resistance personnel. The so-called "residency" agreement is to allow the South Vietnamese authorities to illegally control, alienate, and suppress Vietnamese people living in Laos, forcing them to submit to them, and at the same time allow the South Vietnamese authorities to further strengthen espionage, provocation, and sabotage activities against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on Lao territory.

The statement condemned the Lao authorities for openly tearing up the Geneva Accords under the direction of US imperialism, violating the guarantees they made in the past. The statement pointed out that as US imperialism intensifies the realization of its challenging conspiracy in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the further collusion between Laos and South Vietnam will further aggravate the already tense current situation in Indochina, and seriously threaten the peace and tranquility of the nations of Indochina.

The statement said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that countries responsible for ensuring the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos must take timely action to stop the continued deterioration of the already extremely serious situation in Laos." The statement said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is convinced that its just position will be sympathized with and supported by all countries and peace-loving people of the world, and the conspiracy of US imperialism and its pawns will surely fail."

    越南民主共和国外交部发表声明
    谴责老挝南越签订协定进行军事勾结
    指出这是美国在东南亚策划战争的一个步骤
    新华社河内26日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部今天发表声明，严厉谴责培·萨纳尼空政府同吴庭艳当局签订所谓合作协定。
    声明说，培·萨纳尼空政府在挑起老挝内战的同时，在5月20日同南越当局签订了所谓合作协定。据外国通讯社和老挝、南越的报纸报道，上述协定的内容包括“边界规章”、“在镇压叛乱方面的司法合作”、“侨居”、“民事和军事的合作”和“从西贡和土伦两个港口通到老挝的运输线”等值得注意的问题。
    声明指出，老挝同南越缔结的上述协定实质上是在美帝国主义策划下组织起来的新的军事联盟，是东南亚军事集团宣称所谓受其“保护”的两个地区的进一步勾结。这种行为严重违反了关于印度支那的日内瓦协议。
    声明指出，老挝同南越缔结的上述协定是老挝王国政府同南越当局根据美帝国主义准备战争的计划，而在许多方面、尤其是在军事方面进一步勾结的表现。
    声明接着揭露了老挝王国政府最近几年来同南越当局进行军事勾结的种种事实。声明说，特别是从培·萨纳尼空政府执政以后，上述军事勾结的行动更加频繁。
    声明说，这证明，老挝王国政府和南越当局正在根据美帝国主义关于加强干涉老挝和南越、把老挝和南越变成军事基地和准备在印度支那和东南亚发动战争的整个计划，在军事方面进一步加紧勾结。
    声明说，老挝政府同吴庭艳集团签订的合作协定中的所谓“边界”协议，就是为了让老挝和南越的军队和警察进一步合作来镇压老挝和南越的爱国者——前寮国战斗部队和越南前抗战人员。所谓“侨居”协议就是为了让南越当局非法控制、离间和镇压居住在老挝的越南人，迫使这些人屈从它们，同时让南越当局在老挝领土上进一步加强对越南民主共和国进行间谍、挑衅和破坏活动。
    声明谴责老挝当局在美帝国主义的指使下公然撕毁日内瓦协议，违反了它们过去所作的保证。声明指出，当美帝国主义加紧实现它在印度支那和东南亚的挑战阴谋的时候，老挝同南越之间的进一步勾结，将使已经紧张的印度支那当前局势更加紧张起来，并且使印度支那各民族的和平和安宁受到严重威胁。
    声明说：“越南民主共和国政府认为，负有保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到严正履行的责任的国家，必须及时采取行动，制止已经极为严重的老挝局势的继续恶化。”声明说：“越南民主共和国政府坚信它自己的正义立场将获得各国和世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持，美帝国主义和它的爪牙的阴谋必将失败。”
