    Sun-Dried and Sifted Good Grain Sold to the State
    Some Communes in Shaanxi Province Sell Rapeseed to the State Early
    Zhaoyang, Hubei Purchases Over 1.3 Million Jin of Summer Grain in One Day
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd. Some people's communes in Shaanxi Province have already begun to dry and clean their newly harvested rapeseed and sell it to the state early.
    More than 110,000 mu of rapeseed in Pucheng County has mostly been brought in from the fields, and the rapeseed sold by the people of the county accounts for more than a quarter of the procurement task. The Chengguan Commune in Pucheng County harvested a bumper crop of more than 16,000 mu of rapeseed, and the Xiangcun Management District of this commune sold 100,000 jin of rapeseed to the state in one go. Xixiang County has purchased more than 250,000 jin of rapeseed. The Qianfeng Production Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in this county is working day and night to harvest and thresh in order to achieve "quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick selling." In one day it sold more than 57,000 jin of rapeseed, exceeding the sales task.
    The communes are paying close attention to selling high-quality rapeseed to the state. The Chengguan Commune in Pucheng County organized a rapeseed quality inspection team to strictly inspect the quality of the rapeseed sold to the state. The commune members proposed: "Dry it in the sun and sift it clean, and never let bad seeds leave the village." Therefore, the more than 289,000 jin of rapeseed sold to the state by the whole commune was dried well with few impurities. After inspection, most of it was of the highest quality.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 3rd. Early in the morning of June 1st, in Zhaoyang County, Hubei Province, crowds of people carrying grain loaded the new wheat that had been dried and cleaned the previous day onto ox carts, flatbed carts, and handcarts, and continuously transported it to the state grain purchasing stations. The staff of the purchasing stations had also prepared tea and weighing scales and were busy weighing, recording, and warmly receiving the commune members who came to sell grain.
    On this day, more than 100 grain purchasing stations in the county purchased a total of more than 1,347,000 jin of summer grain. Some production teams exceeded their summer grain sales targets in one day.
    The commune members of each commune are selecting the best grain that has been dried and cleaned to sell to the state. The Guangming Production Team of the Juwan Commune proposed that they must ensure that all the grain sold to the state is of medium and high quality. When delivering grain, the Xiaozhuang Production Team of the Xinshi Commune found that 500 jin of yuan beans were not cleaned enough, so they immediately cleaned them again before selling them. In order to achieve quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick selling, there are currently more than 20,000 people in the county, with more than 5,000 head of cattle, engaged in a concentrated effort to thresh grain. The Xiaozhuang Management District of the Xinshi Commune originally planned to sell 80,000 jin of grain on June 1st, but because of the quick threshing, the amount of grain put into storage on that day reached 100,000 jin.

    晒干筛净交售好粮
    陕西省部分公社提早把油菜籽卖给国家
    湖北枣阳一天收购夏粮一百三十多万斤
    新华社西安3日电  陕西省有的人民公社已开始将新收获的菜籽晒干扬净，提早卖给国家。
    蒲城县十一万多亩油菜大部分已经登场，全县人民出售的菜籽已占征购任务的四分之一以上。蒲城县城关公社一万六千多亩油菜获得丰收，这个公社的翔村管理区一次就卖给国家十万斤油菜籽。西乡县已收购菜籽二十五万多斤。这个县的城关公社乾丰生产大队，为做到
  “快收、快打、快售”，日夜收割打场，一天就卖出菜籽五万七千多斤，超额完成了交售任务。
    各公社很注意把质量好的菜籽卖给国家。蒲城城关公社组织油菜质量检查组，严格地检查出售给国家的菜籽质量，社员们提出：“晒干筛净，决不让坏籽出村”。因此，全社出售给国家的二十八万九千多斤菜籽晒的干，杂质少，经过鉴定，绝大部分是上等品。
    新华社武汉3日电6月1日清早，湖北省枣阳县送粮的人群就把头一天晒干扬净的新麦装上牛车、板车和手推车，络绎不绝地送到国家粮食收购站。收购站的工作人员也早已把茶水、磅秤准备好，一面忙着过秤、记账，一面热情地招待来售粮的社员们。
    这一天，全县一百多个粮食收购站共收购夏粮一百三十四万七千多斤。有些生产小队在一天内就超额完成了夏粮交售任务。
    各公社的社员们纷纷把晒得干扬得净的好粮挑选出来卖给国家。琚湾公社光明生产队提出要保证给国家交售的粮全是中、上等的。新市公社肖庄生产队在交售粮食时，发现有五百斤元豆还扬得不够干净，在临售前又马上重扬了一遍。为了快收、快打、快售，全县目前每天有二万多人带着五千多头耕牛在突击脱粒，新市公社肖庄管理区原计划6月1日交售八万斤粮食，因为脱粒快，这一天入库粮食达到十万斤。（附图片）
