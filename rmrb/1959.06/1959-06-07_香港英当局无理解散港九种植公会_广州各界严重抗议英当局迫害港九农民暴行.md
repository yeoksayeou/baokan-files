Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 6th. The Hong Kong British authorities dissolved the 13-year-old Hong Kong and Kowloon Planting Association on the morning of May 29th on trumped-up charges and unreasonably deported five people: Feng Yong, the chairman of the association; Ye Fuwen and Lu Jianxing, the vice-chairmen; Chen Shuang, the supervisor; and Zhang Tang, the secretary of the Tsuen Wan branch. Feng Yong and the other four have now returned to Guangzhou and have received warm regards from people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City.

According to Hong Kong newspapers, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Planting Association is a mass organization of Hong Kong and Kowloon farmers. Since its establishment thirteen years ago, it has consistently helped Hong Kong and Kowloon farmers solve difficulties, mediate land disputes, research farming techniques, develop agriculture in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and run welfare undertakings for Hong Kong and Kowloon farmers, among other things. It has done much work and is loved and praised by Hong Kong and Kowloon farmers.

Shortly after 4:00 a.m. on May 29th, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched a large number of plainclothes detectives under the guard of armed police to search the Planting Association's headquarters on Lai Chi Kok Road in Kowloon and the Tsuen Wan branch. Armed police were also dispatched to the association's branches, service departments, and welfare groups, forcibly disbanding more than 20 welfare institutions. Feng Yong and the other five responsible persons were also forcibly deported.

The Hong Kong British authorities' public statement on May 29th regarding the dissolution of the Planting Association only cited a provision of the so-called "Societies Ordinance": "If the Governor-in-Council considers that a registered society is being used for purposes detrimental to peace, welfare and good order, or inconsistent with such conditions, he may decide to order the dissolution of that registered society," without citing any factual basis for the so-called "detrimental to peace, welfare and good order." As for the deportation of Feng Yong and the other five, no "reason" was announced at all.

On the afternoon of the 4th, Feng Yong and others held a reception in Guangzhou to expose the Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of them to people from all walks of life, including workers, farmers, overseas Chinese, and industrialists. At the meeting, Feng Yong listed a large number of facts to refute the slander that the Planting Association was "detrimental to peace, welfare and good order." He said: Since its establishment thirteen years ago, the Planting Association has always adhered to the principles of unity and mutual assistance, running welfare well, mediating land disputes, and developing agricultural production. In recent years, it has organized a large number of welfare undertakings for farmers, and distributed a large amount of medical subsidies, living allowances, relief funds, and condolences. He said that the Hong Kong British authorities could not produce a single fact to prove that the Planting Association was so-called "detrimental to peace, welfare and good order." He denounced the Hong Kong British authorities' tyrannical behavior that violated the interests and wishes of the people.

Zhang Zhennan, vice chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting on behalf of more than two million workers in Guangdong Province to express his sincere sympathy to the Hong Kong and Kowloon farmer brothers who had been unreasonably persecuted by the Hong Kong British authorities, and condemned the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable behavior. Huang Meisheng, a farmer representative from the Sanyuanli People's Commune in the suburbs of Guangzhou, spoke at the meeting, expressing on behalf of the Sanyuanli farmers his great indignation at the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable persecution of the Planting Association, which worked for the welfare of Hong Kong and Kowloon farmers.

The heads of various people's organizations also spoke at the meeting, expressing strong protests against the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable behavior. Lu Jianxing, vice chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Planting Association, finally expressed his gratitude for the care and support of the people of the motherland, and expressed his serious protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable persecution.

    香港英当局无理解散港九种植公会
    广州各界严重抗议英当局迫害港九农民暴行
    新华社广州6日电　香港英国当局5月29日早晨以“莫须有”的罪名，解散了有十三年历史的港九种植公会，并且无理地把这个公会的理事长冯镛，副理事长叶富文、陆剑星，监事长陈双和荃湾支部书记张棠五人以武力递解出境。冯镛等五人现在已经回到广州，受到广东省和广州市人民团体的亲切慰问。
    据香港报纸报道，港九种植公会是港九农民的群众团体，成立十三年来，一贯帮助港九农民解决困难、调处耕地纠纷、研究耕作技术、发展港九农业、兴办港九农民福利事业等，作了许多工作，受到港九农民的爱护和赞扬。
    5月29日清晨四时多，香港英国当局派出大批便衣探员在武装警察的警戒下，到九龙荔枝角道种植公会会址和荃湾支部进行搜查，并先后派武装警察分头到公会属下的支部、服务部、福利组等处，将二十多个福利机构强行解散。冯镛等五名负责人也先后被强行递解出境。
    香港英国当局5月29日关于解散种植公会发表的公报，只是引用了所谓“社团条例”的一条规定，
  “如港督会同行政局认为某一注册社团被用于有损和平、福利及良好秩序，或与此等条件不符之用途者，得决定下令解散该注册社团”，没有举出所谓“有损和平、福利及良好秩序”的任何事实根据。至于把冯镛等五人递解出境，根本没有宣布任何“理由”。
    冯镛等4日下午在广州举行招待会，向工人、农民、华侨、工商业等各界人士揭露香港英国当局迫害他们的经过。冯镛在会上列举大量事实，驳斥了所谓种植公会“有损和平、福利及良好秩序”的诬蔑。他说：种植公会成立十三年来，一向以团结互助，办好福利，调处耕地纠纷，发展农业生产为宗旨。近几年来，为农民举办了大批福利事业，发放了大批医药补助金、生活补助金、救济金、慰问金等。他说，香港英国当局举不出一件事实来证明种植公会所谓“有损和平、福利及良好秩序”。他痛斥香港英国当局这种违反人民群众利益和意愿的暴虐行为。
    广东省工会联合会副主席张振南在会上代表广东省二百多万工人向被香港英国当局无理迫害的港九农民兄弟表示亲切慰问，并斥责香港英国当局的无理行为。广州市郊三元里人民公社的农民代表黄美生在会上讲话，他代表三元里农民，对香港英国当局无理迫害为港九农民谋福利的种植公会表示极大愤慨。
    各人民团体的负责人也在会上讲话，对香港英国当局的无理行为表示强硬抗议。港九种植公会副理事长陆剑星最后表示感谢祖国人民的关怀和支持，并对香港英国当局的无理迫害表示严重抗议。
