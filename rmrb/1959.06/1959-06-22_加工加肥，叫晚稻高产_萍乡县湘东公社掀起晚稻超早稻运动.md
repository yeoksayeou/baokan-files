From our Nanchang dispatch on the 21st: The Xiangdong People's Commune in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, is grasping both summer grains and autumn grains. While striving for a bumper harvest of early rice, they are also making early arrangements and preparations for planting and managing late rice well, and striving for a bumper harvest of late rice. Currently, a campaign centered on making all preparations to strive for late rice yields to surpass early rice has been fully launched among the production teams.

The Xiangdong Commune is a double-cropping rice area, with early rice and late rice accounting for roughly the same proportion. This year, the commune planted more than 23,500 mu of early rice. Due to early transplanting, it has generally begun to head and flower since late May. It is expected that harvesting and transplanting late rice can be done around the "Minor Heat" period. The commune party committee believes that during this period of more than half a month, in addition to continuing to strengthen the late-stage field management of early rice to ensure a bumper harvest, how to make timely preparations for planting and managing late rice well is an important key to striving for a bumper harvest of late rice. And striving for a bumper harvest of late rice is a crucial key directly related to the completion of the annual grain production plan.

The commune party committee seized the opportunity to organize commune members to discuss and arrange preparations for planting and managing late rice well in late May. During the discussion, some commune members initially thought that late rice yields have always been low, that “early rice is a treasure, late rice is grass,” and that even if you tried to find a way to increase production, it would not increase by one hundred jin of grain. They still wanted to follow the old method of sowing when it’s time to sow, and transplanting when it’s time to transplant, holding the thought of “reap if there is something to reap, discard if there isn't." In response to this idea, leaders at all levels of the commune, on the one hand, explained to the commune members the significance of striving to plant and manage late rice well for the completion of the annual production plan. On the other hand, they further guided the commune members to debate why late rice yields were lower than early rice in the past, and whether and how to increase late rice yields.

Through debate and comparison, the reasons for the low yield of late rice were identified. The main reasons were that late rice was not valued enough, lacked processing and fertilization, and was susceptible to drought and pests. As long as this situation is changed, late rice can become a "treasure" like early rice. In this way, the idea of actively striving for a bumper harvest of late rice was established among the masses, and measures and methods to ensure good planting and management of late rice and increase late rice yields were found: ① Select drought-resistant and high-yielding fine varieties, and treat them with chemicals to prevent rice blast. ② Sow in advance at the right time and cultivate strong seedlings so that they can immediately turn green and tiller after transplanting. ③ Rationally increase the degree of dense planting. Based on the characteristics of high temperature and strong sunlight during the growth period of late rice and past experience, it was determined that the density of late rice should be appropriately increased compared to early rice. ④ Accumulate a large amount of fertilizer and apply sufficient fertilizer to change the past situation where late rice was not applied with base fertilizer and little top dressing. ⑤ Because late rice pests are serious, it is required to start by eliminating pests in early rice fields, and try to prevent early rice pests from being brought into late rice fields; at the same time, the local indigenous pesticide factories of each team continue to produce a large amount of pesticides, supplemented by purchased chemical pesticides, so as to eliminate pests immediately after transplanting late rice. ⑥ According to the local summer water shortage and autumn drought patterns, it is determined that early rice irrigation should use river water as much as possible, and use little or no reservoir and pond water, and effectively strengthen the water storage and water conservation work of reservoirs and ponds to prevent drought for late rice. ⑦ Prepare tools for summer harvesting and summer planting to ensure that one plot is harvested and another is planted, so that late rice is transplanted early, transplanted well, does not miss the season, and ensures quality.

In addition, in order to implement the policy of planting more and harvesting more, the commune also determined to expand the planting area of double-season late rice to more than 28,600 mu, an increase of more than 5,000 mu compared to early rice, according to the principle of adapting to local conditions.

After determining the above measures for planting and managing late rice well, the production teams and commune members were full of confidence in striving for a greater bumper harvest of late rice, and immediately seized the opportunity to take action and launch a campaign to strive for late rice yields to surpass early rice. Up to now, more than 4,000 mu of late rice seedling fields in the entire commune have been sown in accordance with the requirements. Before sowing, the commune specially held a seed treatment training class to impart technology and promote salt water seed selection and lime water seed selection. The specifications for dense planting of late rice have been formulated according to local conditions.

    加工加肥，叫晚稻高产
    萍乡县湘东公社掀起晚稻超早稻运动
    本报南昌21日电　江西省萍乡县湘东人民公社一手抓夏粮，一手抓秋粮，在力争早稻丰收的同时，又及早为种好管好晚稻、争取晚稻丰收进行了安排和准备。目前，一个以作好一切准备工作为中心的争取晚稻产量超早稻的运动已经在各生产队之间全面展开了。
    湘东公社是双季稻连作地区，早稻与晚稻占有差不多的比重。今年全社种植早稻二万三千五百多亩，由于提早了插秧，5月下旬以来已普遍开始孕穗抽穗，预计到“小暑”前后即可收割和栽插晚稻。公社党委认为，在这半个多月的期间，除继续加强早稻的后期田间管理，确保早稻丰收以外，如何为种好、管好晚稻及时做好准备，是争取晚稻丰收的重要关键。而争取晚稻丰收又是直接关系到全年粮食增产计划完成的重要关键。
    公社党委抓紧时机在5月下旬组织社员讨论和安排了种好、管好晚稻的准备工作。讨论中，开始有部分社员认为：历来晚稻产量就低，“早稻是宝，晚稻是草”，再想办法也增产不了一百斤谷，还是按过去的办法该播种播种、该插秧插秧，抱着“有就收，没就丢”的思想。针对这种思想，公社各级领导一方面向社员讲清争取种好、管好晚稻对完成全年生产计划的意义，一方面进一步引导社员对过去晚稻产量为什么比早稻低，能不能和如何提高晚稻产量开展了辩论。
    通过辩论、对比，查清了晚稻低产的原因，主要是对晚稻不够重视，缺少加工加肥和容易遭受旱灾和病虫害，只要改变这种情况，晚稻同早稻一样能成“宝”。这样就在群众中树立起积极争取晚稻丰收的思想，找出了保证种好、管好晚稻增加晚稻产量的措施和办法：①选用耐旱高产的良种，并加以药剂处理，以防止发生稻热病。②适时提早播种，培育壮秧，以便栽插后能立即转青发蔸。③合理增加密植的程度，根据晚稻生长期间气温高、阳光强的特点和以往的经验，确定晚稻的密度比早稻适当增加。④大量积肥，施足肥料，改变过去晚稻不施基肥和少施追肥的情况。⑤由于晚稻虫害严重，要求从消灭早稻田的虫害做起，尽量防止早稻虫害带到晚稻田里；同时由各队土农药厂继续大量生产农药，辅以购买的化学农药，以备晚稻插秧后发现虫害立即消灭。⑥根据当地夏季用水缺，秋季易旱的规律，确定早稻灌溉尽量先用河水，不用或少用水库水塘的水，并切实加强水库水塘的蓄水保水工作，以备晚稻防旱。⑦作好夏收夏种的工具准备，以确保收一块种一块，使晚稻插得早、插得好，不误季节，保证质量。
    此外，为了贯彻多种多收的方针，全社还根据因地制宜的原则，确定二季晚稻种植面积扩大到二万八千六百多亩，比早稻增加五千多亩。
    在确定以上种好、管好晚稻的措施后，各生产队和社员们对争取晚稻更大丰收信心百倍，并立即抓住时机，行动起来，开展了争取晚稻产量超早稻的运动。到现在为止，全社四千多亩晚稻秧田已全部按照要求播种。播种前公社专门举办了种籽处理训练班传授技术，推广了盐水选种和石灰水选种。晚稻密植规格因地制宜地制定了方案。
