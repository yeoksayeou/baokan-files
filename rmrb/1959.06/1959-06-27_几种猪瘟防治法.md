Several Methods for Preventing and Treating Swine Fever

	White Scours
	Piglets that have just left their mothers are prone to this disease. The treatment method is to mix several drugs, such as bismuth subnitrate, sodium bicarbonate, sulfa tablets, and Danbaimei, and feed them to the pigs in warm water (for piglets under two months, the dosage is one small grain of bismuth subnitrate, half a grain each of sodium bicarbonate and sulfa tablets, and one gram of Danbaimei; for piglets over two months, double the dosage), three times a day. In this way, they can recover in one or two days.

	Enzootic Pneumonia
	This is a common disease in piglets, and it poses a great threat to the development of pig production, with a high mortality rate. Recently, the Tongxin Restaurant in Qingshan District, Wuhan City, found a local method to treat enzootic pneumonia in pigs while developing the production of non-staple foods: they found that after pigs were infected with this disease, they cut off about two inches of the pig's tail to let out blood; at the same time, they cut a small opening in the pig's ear, put in a piece of alum the size of a mung bean, and tied it with thin hemp rope. When the pig's ear became swollen, they cut it open again to release the dirty blood. After such treatment, the sick pigs can recover.

	Yellow Leg Disease
	Growing pigs weighing thirty to forty pounds are susceptible to this disease after being exposed to dampness. After discovering that a pig has this disease, first use your hand to feel the pig's leg to find the painful area, then use the sharp end of a broken porcelain shard to cut a slit in the painful area to release the dirty blood, then apply anti-inflammatory ointment, wrap it with gauze, and it will heal in four or five days.

	Mange
	First dissolve soap in boiling water to create foam. After it has cooled slightly, use a stiff bristle brush to apply the soap foam and scrub the sick pig (do not scrub the entire body, only scrub one-half of the area, two or three times a day). Then, mix 80% talc powder with 20% 666 powder, and apply it to the pig's body (also one-half of the area, and be careful not to get the medicine into the pig's eyes and mouth). It can be cured in two or three days.

	These methods for preventing and treating pig diseases have been adopted by the Jianghan Meat Processing Factory and have all proven effective. (Originally published in Changjiang Daily) (Attached picture)

    几种猪瘟防治法
    白痢
    才脱离母体不多久的仔猪容易得这种病症。治疗方法是，把次硝生铋、重炭酸氢钠、磺胺片、旦白梅等几种药物掺在一起，用温开水冲调喂猪（两个月以内的仔猪一次用量是次硝生铋一小颗，重炭酸氢钠和磺胺片各半颗，旦白梅一克，两个月以上仔猪用量加倍），一天喂三次，这样，一天或两三天就可痊愈。
    喘气病
    是猪仔常见的病症，这种病对生猪发展有很大威胁，死亡率很高。最近，武汉市青山区同心餐馆在发展副食品生产中，找到了土法治疗生猪喘气病的方法：他们发现猪感染上这种病症后，就将猪的尾巴割去两寸左右，放血；同时在猪耳朵上割开一个小口，将一块绿豆大小的明矾放入，用细麻绳捆扎起来，待猪耳朵发肿时，再割开放出污血。经过这样处理以后，病猪即可痊愈。
    腿黄病
    三、四十斤重的架子猪在受湿气侵蚀后，容易感染这种病症。发现猪子得上这种病后，可先用手探摸病猪腿部，找出疼痛处，再用破磁片的尖端在疼痛处划开一道口子，放出污血，然后敷以消炎膏，用纱布包上，四、五天后即可痊愈。
    癞皮猪
    先把肥皂放在开水里溶化成泡沫，待稍凉后，用硬棕刷沾肥皂泡沫擦洗病猪（不能全身都擦洗，只能擦二分之一的部位，一天擦洗两三次），然后再以80％的滑石粉和20％的六六六粉掺合起来，擦抹猪身（也是二分之一的部位，还要注意不要将药物撒进病猪的眼睛里和口里），两三天就可治好。
    以上这几种防治猪病的方法经江汉肉类加工厂采用后，都已收到疗效。（原载长江日报）（附图片）
