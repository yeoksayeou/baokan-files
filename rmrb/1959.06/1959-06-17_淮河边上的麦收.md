Wheat Harvest on the Banks of the Huai River
By our reporters Yu Ming and Shi Zhengzhang

　　The Huai River embankment is like a city wall, firmly protecting the 100,000 mu of wheat along the Huai River in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province. Standing on the Huai embankment and looking towards the big river bend, the wheat sea, with its rolling waves, stretches to the distant horizon. These days, this "sea" has been a scene of jubilation from the moment the moon appears, with harvest songs echoing, villagers wielding their sickles day and night to rush the wheat harvest, combine harvesters roaring, and the roads filled with dust, with ox carts, horse carts, and hand carts carrying wheat coming and going endlessly. Comparing this boiling "sea" with the Huai River outside the embankment, the Huai River has become a quiet little river.
　　
　　We walked in the big river bend, asking the cart drivers along the way, and they all answered: "Heh! I have never hauled such wheat. In previous years, one cart could haul two or three mu, but this year, one cart can't even haul one mu!" Three old men in their seventies from the Weishan Brigade of the Red Flag Commune were enthusiastically comparing themselves to the height of the wheat: He Baogui stood in the wheat field, and the wheat was taller than his eyebrows; He Baojun stood in the furrow, and the wheat went over his head; He Baoguo's mother touched the thick wheat ears and said repeatedly, "Good wheat, good wheat!" He Baogui said happily, "Seeing the wheat growing so well, I wouldn't mind living another seventy years." These old men had heard that the wheat in the bay this year was exceptionally good and had long wanted to see it. Captain Jin Wenyuan knew their thoughts and took them along to share the joy of the harvest while the ox cart was going to the river bay. We came to a wheat field where a group of young men and women were singing and dancing group dances on the harvested wheat field. How happy they were! Then, at a command, "Reap the wheat!" Such a neat team, such a fast speed! The competition began. Captain Chen Yulun told us that this 200-plus mu of wheat field was generally deep-plowed more than a foot, harrowed finely, and the amount of seeds sown was greatly increased compared to the past. The basal fertilizer alone was more than 1,000 dan per mu. From the start of planting wheat, more than a dozen people built thatched sheds and lived on the edge of the field, catching field mice, chasing wild geese, topdressing, and weeding. They lived there until February of this year, when the wild geese flew away and they left the fields. After that, they sprayed medicine to control insects eight or nine times… They really put in a lot of effort.
　　
　　"Harvesting the big river bend will enrich half the sky." Everyone was attracted to this good wheat. We spent the night in the command shed in the field. With the stars and moon in the sky, where did the sound of sharpening knives come from? It awakened all the people sleeping in the river bend. People from the government offices and the army also rushed from the villages. No one wanted to be late to the wheat field. The canteen cooks also brought the meals.
　　
　　The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were particularly cheered by the masses. An old man, with a smile on his face, had become a volunteer knife sharpener for the PLA comrades these days. Chen Xuezhang, a deputy squad leader of the fourth company of the second detachment, took his soldiers to the field and saw that the wheat was growing so densely that it was a little difficult to start. After discussing with his soldiers, Chen squad leader regarded this wheat field as Taiwan to attack. He said, "Comrades, let's launch an encirclement from the four corners, Chiang Kai-shek is in the wheat!" In an instant, the soldiers shouted and charged into battle from all sides. The whole company harvested eighty-two mu of wheat on the first day and increased to one hundred and twenty-six mu on the second day. The soldiers and the masses were as close as fish and water, and their hard work made people cry with emotion.
　　
　　The combine harvesters were working hard, and the machine operator Tian Zipu was sweating profusely. In order to harvest cleanly, he often checked the quality of his harvesting and solicited the opinions of the masses. These combine harvester operators came from Heilongjiang to help with the wheat harvest. Tian Zipu told us that he really didn't expect the wheat along the Huai River to grow so well.
　　
　　A strong wind and heavy rain came, but there were still more than 20,000 mu of wheat in the bay that had not been harvested. People stood in the wind and rain and worked harder and harder. In many wheat fields, small mountains of wheat were piled up immediately, determined not to let the wind blow away the wheat or the rain damage the wheat. In the evening, after the wheat was piled up, people ran back to the village to change their soaked clothes. The wind blew even harder at night, and the rain fell even heavier. The road to the river bay was muddy and the water was ankle-deep, making it difficult to walk. However, even under these circumstances, as soon as it dawned, people rushed to the river bay again and started the battle to seize grain in the strong wind and heavy rain. People were wearing cotton clothes, but they were also soaked by the rain. Some soldiers simply took off their upper bodies and bathed. The rain was getting heavier and heavier. Where did the opera singing come from? It turned out to be Zhang Lanying, a woman, leading the members of her group to sing and reap at the same time. They sang "Four Seasons Push," "Si Zhou Opera," and "Huaibei Flower Drum," one after another, and the wheat was reaped one after another.

    淮河边上的麦收
    本报记者　于明　石正章
      淮河大堤像一堵城墙，牢牢地卫护着安徽怀远县沿淮十万亩小麦。站在淮堤上朝大河湾一望，波浪滔滔的麦海一直伸向远方的天边。这几天来，这个“海”里从月亮一露头，就是一片欢腾，丰收的歌声荡漾，社员们日夜挥舞着镰刀抢收小麦，收割机声??地响着，道路上烟尘滚滚，拉麦子的牛车、马车和板车来往不绝。把这个沸腾的“海”和堤外的淮河对比一下，淮河成了一条静静的小河。
    我们在大河湾里走着，沿途随便问那些赶车的人，他们都这样回答：“嗬！俺没有拉过这样的麦子，往年一车能拉两、三亩，今年一亩也拉不完！”红旗公社委山大队的三个七十多岁的老年人，兴致勃勃地在和麦子比高低：何保贵站在麦地里，麦子高过了他的眼眉毛；何保君在墒沟里一站，麦子漫过了他的头；何保国的妈妈摸着粗壮的麦穗儿，连声说“好麦，好麦！”何保贵高兴的说：“眼看麦子长得这样好，再活七十岁也不嫌多。”这几位老年人听说今年湾里的麦子格外好，早就想来看看，队长金文元知道了他们的心事，趁着牛车下河湾的机会，就把他们带来分享丰收的眼福来了。我们来到一块麦地上，一伙青年男女正在收割过的麦地上唱歌跳集体舞，他们的心情是多么欢乐呵！接着，一声号令：“割麦了！”好整齐的队伍，好快的速度！竞赛的战斗展开了。队长陈玉伦告诉我们，这块二百多亩麦地，普遍深翻一尺多，耙耱得细，下种量比以往大大增加，光底肥每亩就施千担以上，从种麦开始，十几个人便搭起了草棚住在地边上，捉田鼠、赶老雁，追肥、锄草，一直住到今年2月，老雁飞走才离开田头；以后，又是打药治虫八九次……，真是费尽了心血。
    “收了大河湾，富了半边天”，人人都被这片好麦子吸引住了。我们夜宿在田间的指挥棚里，星月当空，哪个地方出现了磨刀声？它惊醒了全河湾露宿的人们。机关、部队的人们也从庄子里赶来了，谁都不肯迟进麦田一步。食堂炊事员把饭菜也送来了。
    解放军的官兵们特别受到了群众的喝彩。一个老年人，笑眯着眼睛，他这几天已成为解放军同志的志愿磨刀手了。二分队四连的一个副班长陈学章，带着战士们到地里一看，片片麦子长得密密麻麻，倒有点使人无法下手了。陈班长和战士们一商量，就把这块麦田当成台湾来进攻，他说：“同志们，咱们从四角展开围剿吧，蒋介石就在麦子当中！”顷刻间战士们喊声震天，从四边投入了战斗，全连第一日割麦八十二亩，第二天就提高到一百二十六亩。战士们和群众水乳交融，他们的苦干精神令人感动得流出眼泪。
    收割机紧张地在工作，机手田子朴满头大汗。为了收打干净，他经常检查自己收割的质量，并征求群众的意见。这些收割机手是从黑龙江来帮助麦收的。田子朴对我们说，真没有想到淮河沿岸的麦子长得这样好。
    大风大雨袭来了，可是湾里的小麦还有二万多亩没有收割，人们站在风雨里干得越来越起劲，在许多麦田里立刻堆起了一座座的小山头，坚决不让风刮走麦子，雨淋坏麦子。傍晚，麦子堆好了，人们才跑回庄上去换掉湿透的衣服。晚上风刮得更凶，雨下得更大。到河湾的道路，泥水没脚，走一步拔一步，十分困难。可是，就在这种情况下，天一亮，人们又冲向河湾去了，在大风大雨中开始了夺粮战斗。人们穿着棉衣也被雨水淋透了，有的战士索性脱光了上身沐浴。雨越下越猛了，那里来的唱戏声？原来是妇女张兰英，正领着全组社员边唱边割。她们唱四季推子、泗洲戏、淮北花鼓，一个接着一个，小麦也一片接着一片地割下来了。
