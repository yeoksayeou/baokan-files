    Strengthen Labor Protection, Emphasize Safe Production
    Tianjin Shipyard Prepares Large Quantities of Summer Heat Prevention Supplies
    Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory Cares About Workers Eating Well and Sleeping Well
    Xinhua Tin Mine Improves Working Conditions and Controls Dust
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th. The General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at Tianjin Shipyard is grasping both production and livelihood, ensuring that workers are healthy in body and mind and full of energy.
    The Party General Branch of this factory recognizes that the more energetic the workers are, the more important it is to care for the lives of the masses. As early as March, they studied summer heat prevention and cooling measures and safety measures, and prepared items such as Ren Dan (a traditional Chinese medicine for heatstroke), DDT, curtains, and bamboo blinds. Since the beginning of summer, they have built 5,000 square meters of sunshade sheds and a large break shed. In order to allow workers in high-temperature workshops to drink cool beverages in the summer, the factory also prepared freezers to make popsicles for high-temperature workers, and prepared nearly twenty cooling fans to cool down high-temperature workshops.
    The Party General Branch appointed Deputy Director Qiao Zhenzong and the head of the General Affairs Section and other personnel to be specifically responsible for leading this work.
    The Party General Branch pays close attention to organizing workers to carry out cultural and sports activities. The factory organized an amateur theater troupe, which regularly performs programs for the workers of the factory, enabling workers to get good entertainment and rest in their spare time. They are also very active in sports activities. The factory leadership also pays attention to the personal hygiene of the workers and the environmental hygiene of the factory site, regularly supervising and inspecting, and conducting preventive health knowledge education for the workers.
    The factory's timely solution to the living problems of the workers has greatly encouraged all the workers in the factory. They are in high spirits to produce, determined to increase production, save raw materials and materials, and ensure product quality.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th. Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory pays attention to caring for the lives of its workers, doing everything possible to ensure that workers are well-fed, sleep well, take good care of their children, are safe in production, and actively arrange equipment maintenance work.
    This factory attaches great importance to the labor protection work of its workers. The factory began preparing for summer heat prevention and cooling work as early as January of this year. This year alone, more than two hundred new fan motors for ventilation have been added. The protective equipment on the machine tools in the workshop has also been inspected, with those that need to be added added, and those that need to be repaired repaired. In the past, the transportation of materials and semi-finished products between workshops mainly relied on manual carrying, but now most of it has been changed to transportation by carts, which greatly reduces the labor intensity of the workers. In order to ensure the workers' sleep time, on the one hand, they adhere to the work and rest system, and generally do not work overtime except for special tasks; on the other hand, they have adjusted the workers' dormitories, so that single workers in the same work section and the same group live together as much as possible.
    In October of last year, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the factory established a working committee specifically responsible for the welfare of the workers. Some leading cadres even went to the most critical living and welfare departments to cultivate experimental plots. Because the Party Committee has strengthened its leadership in this area, the living and welfare departments have done a better job in serving production and serving the workers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 7th. Xinhua Tin Mine in Hunan Province has fundamentally controlled the occupational disease that poses the greatest threat to workers' health - silicosis. Now, the dust in every tunnel of the tin mine has been reduced to 0.5 milligrams per cubic meter, which is lower than the national standard of 2 milligrams.
    In early May this year, when reporters visited Tin Mine, as soon as they entered the tunnels, the electric lights were brightly lit, a cool breeze was blowing, the air was fresh, and breathing was easy. It was almost impossible to feel that they were in tunnels 200 meters underground. At the main entrances and exits leading to the tunnels, there are giant exhaust fans running day and night; more than seventy small exhaust fans are constantly running in the tunnels. The airflow sucked in and discharged by the machines has a certain route and regularly extracts silica dust and exhaust gas, allowing fresh air to flow in. The toxic underground water in the tunnels is extracted by large water pumps, and high-pressure water is input from the ground, reducing the toxicity of silica dust. "Automatic water curtains" created by workers have been installed in flat tunnels and hoppers. If you walk a certain distance and step on a wooden board, water will be sprayed automatically. In the mining area, workers all use wet rock drills; after blasting, water is quickly sprayed to eliminate dust, and exhaust gas is discharged through "automatic air doors." Miners also wear masks and other protective equipment to prevent silica dust from entering the body in many ways. Visitors from mines all over the country praised: The labor conditions of the workers at Tin Mine are good, and the old root of silicosis has been eradicated.
    In the process of mining and manufacturing mineral powder, silica dust and powder particles fly around, and workers inhale large amounts of silicon dioxide powder. Over time, the lungs gradually harden and become silicosis.
    After liberation, the Party and the government have taken many preventive measures against this silicosis. In the past ten years alone, the investment in ventilation, dust prevention, and other aspects has reached more than 200,000 yuan. Due to the continuous improvement of production conditions and the continuous strengthening of prevention and control work, the number of people suffering from silicosis in Tin Mine has been decreasing year by year, and many old silicosis patients have been treated.

    加强劳动保护　重视安全生产
    天津船舶修造厂准备大批防暑用品
    重庆建设机床厂关心职工吃好睡好
    新化锡矿山改善劳动条件控制粉尘
    据新华社天津7日电　中共天津市船舶修造厂总支委员会，一手抓生产，一手抓生活，使工人身心健康，干劲十足。
    这个厂的党总支认识到工人干劲越大，越要关心群众生活，早在3月份就研究了夏季防暑降温和安全措施，准备了仁丹、滴滴涕、窗帘、竹帘等。入夏以来建起了五千平方公尺的防晒棚和一个大的工间休息棚。为了使高温车间在夏季喝到清凉饮料，工厂还准备了冷冻机为高温工人制造冰棒，还准备了近二十个冷风扇，给高温车间降温。
    这个厂党总支指定副厂长乔振宗及总务科长等人员，专门负责领导这项工作。
    党总支很注意组织职工开展文娱体育活动。工厂组织了业余剧团，经常给本厂工人演出节目，使工人在劳动之余得到很好的娱乐和休息。在体育活动上也很活跃。工厂领导方面还注意工人个人卫生和厂地环境卫生，经常督促检查，向工人进行预防为主的卫生常识教育。
    这个厂及时解决职工生活问题，给全厂职工很大的鼓舞。他们生产情绪旺盛，决心提高生产，节约原料材料，保证产品质量。
    据新华社重庆7日电　重庆建设机床厂注意关心职工生活，千方百计保证职工吃饱、睡好、带好娃娃、安全生产，积极布置设备维护工作。
    这个工厂很重视职工的劳动保护工作。工厂从今年1月份就开始作防暑降温的准备工作，仅通风用的风扇马达一项，今年就新添置二百多个。车间机床上的防护设备，也都经过检查，该添置的已添置，该修补的已修补。过去，车间与车间之间，运送材料和半成品，主要靠人工担抬，现在已多半改用小车运，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。为了保证工人的睡眠时间，一方面坚持作息制度，除特殊任务外，一般不加班加点；另一方面调整了职工宿舍，使同工段同小组的单身工人尽量住在一起。
    这个厂在去年10月份，就在党委的领导下成立了专管职工生活福利的工作委员会，有的领导干部还深入到最关键的生活福利部门种试验田。由于党委加强了这方面的领导，生活福利部门为生产服务、为职工服务就作得比较好。
    据新华社长沙7日电　湖南省新化锡矿山已经从根本上控制了危害工人健康最大的一种职业病——矽肺病。现在，锡矿山条条窿道内的粉尘，已降低到每立方公尺零点五毫克，比国家规定的二毫克的标准还低。
    今年5月上旬，记者访问锡矿山时，一走进窿道，顿时电灯通明，凉风习习，空气新鲜，呼吸自如，差不多感觉不出是在地下二百公尺的窿道中。在通向各条窿道的总进出口处，都装有一部巨型抽风机，日夜轰鸣不停；窿道内有七十多个小型抽风机不停地转动，机器吸进和排出的气流，都有一定路线，有规律地把矽尘、废气抽出，使新鲜空气流进。窿内含毒的地下水，由大型水泵抽出，地面高压水输入，减少了矽尘的毒害。在平巷和漏斗，都装有工人创造的“自动水幕”，你走一段路，脚踩木板，就会自动喷水；在采矿场，工人们全部使用湿式风钻；放炮过后迅速喷水消尘，由“自动风门”排气。矿工们还带有口罩等防护品，从多方面防止矽尘侵入体内。来自全国各地矿山的参观者都赞扬说：锡矿山工人的劳动条件好，矽肺病的老根子被拔掉了。
    在采矿和制造矿粉过程中，矽尘、粉粒飞扬，工人吸入大量的二氧化矽粉，日积月累，肺部便逐渐硬结成为矽肺病。
    解放后，党和政府对这种矽肺病采取了许多预防措施，十年来，仅投资到通风、防尘等方面的费用即达二十多万元。由于生产条件不断改善，防治工作不断加强，锡矿山患矽肺病的人数逐年下降，并且治疗了不少老的矽肺病患者。
