Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th. "Labour News" published a communique today announcing that the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party began a plenary session on June 27th.

The communique stated that the agenda for the meeting was: 1. On further developing animal husbandry; 2. On promoting the development of the electrical industry.

The communique stated that Kim Man-geum, Director of the Agricultural Department of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda. Kim Il Sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, spoke on the tasks for developing animal husbandry in the future. The meeting will continue.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th. "Labour News" today published the report by Kim Man-geum, Director of the Agricultural Department of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party held on June 27th, on further developing animal husbandry.

In his report, Kim Man-geum first pointed out the great achievements made by Korea in developing animal husbandry after the war. He said that after the war, Korea newly established a large number of state-run farms, ranches, and other new animal husbandry bases, and agricultural cooperatives also actively developed animal husbandry. As a result, during the three-year plan after the war, animal husbandry, which had been severely damaged during the war, basically recovered to the pre-war level. During the period of 1957-1958, animal husbandry developed greatly again; at present, the number of livestock and poultry in northern Korea has reached two to three times the pre-war level.

Kim Man-geum said that the current great task that the Party has put forward to the animal husbandry sector is: in the next few years, to raise the per capita output of livestock products, mainly meat, to the level of advanced countries in the world.

Kim Man-geum pointed out that in order to accomplish this task, it is first necessary to concentrate all efforts on consolidating the feed base, which is the foundation of animal husbandry, and to utilize every possibility to develop feed production. He said: Wheat should be planted on half of the dry land, and after harvesting the wheat, corn and soybeans should be planted as feed; paddy fields should be planted with pre-crop feed crops such as wheat, peas, and vegetables before transplanting rice seedlings. In this way, it is possible to increase feed production while achieving high yields of major crops and cash crops. Kim Man-geum said: If the wheat planting area can be expanded to 400,000 chongbo in two or three years, more than one million tons of wheat can be harvested each year, and its after-crop can be used as feed to produce more than 400,000 tons of meat.

Kim Man-geum also emphasized that state-run farms and ranches should make every effort to increase the production of silage, and food factories and rice mills should set up feed processing plants to increase feed production using by-products; fish heads and fish offal should also be used to produce feed in aquatic product processing plants.

Kim Man-geum emphasized the importance of improving breeding stock. He also said that a large number of silage harvesters, chaff cutters, and other machinery should be manufactured in order to realize the mechanization of all animal husbandry operations on state-run farms and ranches in the next few years.

    朝鲜劳动党举行中央全会
    金日成就发展畜产业任务问题发了言
    金万金作进一步发展畜产业的报告
    新华社平壤28日电　“劳动新闻”今天刊载的一项公报宣布，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在6月27日开始举行全体会议。
    公报说，这次会议的议程是：一、关于进一步发展畜产业；二、关于促进电气工业的发展。
    公报说，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会农业部部长金万金在会上就第一项议程作了报告。朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成就今后发展畜产业的任务问题发了言。会议将继续举行。
    新华社平壤28日电“劳动新闻”今天刊载了朝鲜劳动党中央委员会农业部部长金万金在6月27日举行的劳动党中央委员会全体会议上所作的关于进一步发展畜产业的报告。
    金万金在报告中首先指出朝鲜战后在发展畜产业方面所取得的巨大成就。他说，朝鲜在战后新建立了大量的国营农场、牧场等新的畜产业基地，各农业社也积极发展了畜产业，结果在战后的三年计划期间就使战时遭到严重破坏的畜产业基本上恢复到战前水平。在1957年—1958年期间，畜产业又有了很大的发展；目前，朝鲜北部的牲畜和家禽数已经达到战前的二倍到三倍。
    金万金说，党向畜产部门提出的当前的巨大任务是：在最近几年内，要把以肉类为主的畜产品的按人口平均计算的产量提高到世界先进国家的水平。
    金万金指出，为了完成这个任务，首先要集中一切力量巩固作为畜产业的基础的饲料基地，利用一切可能来发展饲料生产。他说：在一半旱田中要多种小麦，收割小麦后，种玉米和大豆作为饲料；水田在插秧前要种麦类、豌豆、蔬菜等前作饲料作物。这样，就有可能在主要作物和经济作物取得高产的同时，增加饲料产量。金万金说：如果能够在二、三年内把小麦种植面积扩大到四十万町步，每年就能收获一百万吨以上的小麦，并且可以利用它的后作当作饲料，生产四十万吨以上的肉类。
    金万金还强调指出，国营农场、牧场要尽一切努力增产青贮饲料，食品厂、精米厂要设饲料加工厂，用副产品增产饲料；在水产加工厂也要利用鱼头、鱼内脏生产饲料。
    金万金强调了改良种畜工作的重要性。他还说，应该大量制造青贮饲料收割机、切草机等机械，以便在最近几年内实现国营农场、牧场的一切畜牧作业的机械化。
