Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 25th: Hunan's new rapeseed is entering storage, and various localities are paying particular attention to the quality inspection and processing of the rapeseed entering storage to prevent the rapeseed from becoming moldy and rotten.

As of the 20th, Hunan Province had completed 41.4% of this year's rapeseed procurement task; Anxiang, Changsha, and Shaodong counties, which have made faster progress, have overfulfilled the procurement task. The oil entering storage in various places is generally of very good quality. According to the inspection by Dongkou County, the vast majority of the more than 1.05 million jin of rapeseed that has entered storage has full grains, with impurities not exceeding 2%, which basically meets the national quality standards.

This year, Hunan Province has adopted the method of collecting both oil and seeds. At present, rapeseed accounts for more than 80% of the oil that has been put into storage. Rapeseed contains moisture and is not easy to store. Currently, it is the Meiyu season in Jiangnan, with a lot of rain and heavy humidity, and concentrated rapeseed is prone to heat, mold, and rot. Therefore, various parts of Hunan have generally increased processing power to process rapeseed into rapeseed oil in a timely manner. Shaoyang Prefecture has arranged more than 4,400 laborers and organized more than 1,100 oil presses, adopting the method of rotating shifts day and night, with people resting but the presses not resting, to ensure that rapeseed is processed as it enters storage. Pingjiang County increased manpower for oil pressing, which also greatly accelerated the processing speed of rapeseed entering storage. Qupu County’s Qiaojiang People’s Commune adopted methods such as slow frying, fine grinding, crushing, and heavy pressing, increasing the oil extracted from every 100 jin of rapeseed from 30 jin to 41 jin.

Many places have checked the rapeseed that has been put into storage. Nearly 800 cadres in Hengyang County recently went to the countryside to organize the masses to transport oil into storage and to check the quality of the rapeseed that has been put into storage. For a small amount of rapeseed with more moisture, it is promptly turned over and dried to prevent mold and rot.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 25th: After the farmers in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, achieved a bumper harvest of rapeseed, they enthusiastically sold rapeseed. As of the 19th, the county has sold more than 2,791,000 jin, overfulfilling the task of unified purchase of rapeseed.

The reason why the rapeseed purchase work in this county is so fast is primarily because various communes have set off a surge of collecting, grinding, and delivering into storage. At the same time, the national grain department has added oil purchase points, implemented the policy of grading and pricing, and high quality with high price; organized purchasing personnel to go to the countryside to help with acceptance and transfer, and organized 350 delivery groups to supply rural production materials and living materials.

    湖南重视入库油菜籽质量
    蒲城油菜籽收购计划超额完成
    新华社长沙25日电　湖南的新油菜籽正在入库，各地特别重视入库油菜籽的质量检查和加工处理工作，防止菜籽霉烂。
    到20日止，湖南省已完成今年菜油收购任务的41.4％；进度较快的安乡、长沙、邵东三县已超额完成收购任务。各地入库的油料一般质量很好。据洞口县检查，已入库的一百零五万多斤油菜籽，绝大部分籽粒饱满，杂质不超过2％，基本上符合国家规定的质量标准。
    今年湖南省采取油、籽兼收的办法，目前已入库的油料中，油菜籽占80％以上。油菜籽含有水分，不易保管，当前又正是江南梅雨季节，雨水多，湿气重，集中堆放的油菜籽容易发热、霉烂。因此，湖南各地普遍增加加工的力量，及时把油菜籽加工成菜油。邵阳专区安排了四千四百多个劳动力，组织一千一百多个榨坊，采取日夜轮班，人歇榨不歇的办法，做到了油菜籽随入库随加工。平江县增加榨油的人力，也使入库油菜籽的加工速度大大加快。溆浦县桥江人民公社采取慢炒、磨细、碾碎、重榨等办法，使每一百斤菜籽榨出的油由三十斤增加到四十一斤。
    许多地方检查了已入库的油菜籽。衡阳县最近有近八百名干部下乡，一面组织群众运送油料入库，一面检查已入库的菜籽质量。对少数水分较多的油菜籽，及时加以翻晒，防止霉烂。
    据新华社西安25日电　陕西省蒲城县农民获得油菜丰收以后，踊跃出售油菜籽。截至19日止，全县已经出售二百七十九万一千多斤，超额完成油菜籽统购任务。
    这个县的油菜籽收购工作所以很快，首先由于各个公社掀起了边收、边碾、边送售入库的热潮。同时，国家粮食部门增设了油料收购点，贯彻执行分等论价、优质优价的政策；组织收购人员下乡帮助验收调运，并且组织了三百五十个送货小组，供应农村生产资料和生活资料。
