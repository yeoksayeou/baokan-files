Xinhua News Agency, June 4th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party on June 4th, warmly congratulating the 40th anniversary of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party,
Dear Comrades:

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm, fraternal congratulations to you, and through you to all members of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people.

Since its establishment, the Bulgarian Communist Party has waged a heroic and tenacious struggle for the interests of the Bulgarian working class and working people, and for the victory of socialism in Bulgaria. As early as September 1923, under the leadership of the outstanding activist of the international workers' movement, Dimitrov, your party held an anti-fascist armed uprising, which wrote a glorious page in the history of the Bulgarian revolution and the international anti-fascist struggle. During the reign of the reactionary Boris dynasty, the Bulgarian Communist Party carried out an indomitable, arduous, and unyielding underground struggle, and led the Bulgarian people in a heroic anti-fascist guerrilla war.

When the great Soviet Red Army defeated German fascism and the Bulgarian people were liberated, the Bulgarian Communist Party led the Bulgarian working class and all working people to establish the People's Republic of Bulgaria. In the years that followed, it carried out arduous work to defend world peace and to realize socialist revolution and socialist construction, and achieved great victories. Now the People's Republic of Bulgaria has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial-agricultural country. The Bulgarian Communist Party has made valuable contributions to the international communist movement by resolutely combating the Yugoslav modern revisionism which opposes the principles of Marxism-Leninism, in order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to maintain the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In the recent six months, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and inspired by the fighting slogan of "completing the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule," the people's enthusiasm has been greatly brought into play, and the speed of socialist construction has been greatly increased. It is fully believed that you will achieve even more brilliant achievements in the future construction.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have always regarded the achievements made by the fraternal Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people as their own, and firmly believe that these achievements play a great inspiring role in our country's socialist construction. On the occasion of the founding anniversary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, we sincerely wish the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people new and greater achievements in further developing the cause of socialist construction, in consolidating the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the cause of the international communist movement, in the resolute struggle against revisionism, and in the struggle to defend world peace and strive for human progress.

    中共中央电贺保共四十周年
    新华社4日讯　中国共产党中央委员会4日致电保加利亚共产党中央委员会，热烈祝贺保加利亚共产党四十周年。电文如下：保加利亚共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    在这保加利亚共产党四十周年的时候，中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党全体党员和全中国人民，向你们并通过你们向保加利亚共产党全体党员和保加利亚人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    保加利亚共产党自成立之日起，就为保加利亚工人阶级和劳动人民的利益，为社会主义在保加利亚的胜利，进行了英勇的顽强的斗争。早在1923年9月，你们的党就在国际工人运动杰出的活动家——季米特洛夫的领导下，举行了反法西斯的武装起义，它在保加利亚革命和国际反法西斯斗争的历史中写下了光辉的一页。在鲍里斯反动王朝统治时期，保加利亚共产党进行了不屈不挠的艰苦卓绝的地下斗争，领导了保加利亚人民进行了反法西斯的英勇的游击战争。
    当伟大的苏联红军战胜了德国法西斯，保加利亚人民获得了解放之后，保加利亚共产党领导保加利亚的工人阶级和全体劳动人民建立了保加利亚人民共和国；在其以后的年代中，为保卫世界和平，为实现社会主义革命和社会主义建设，又进行了艰巨的工作，而且取得了巨大的胜利。现在保加利亚人民共和国已经从一个落后的农业国变成了先进的社会主义工业—农业国。保加利亚共产党为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，同反对马克思列宁主义原则的南斯拉夫现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争，从而为国际共产主义运动作出了可贵的贡献。
    最近半年以来，保加利亚共产党领导全国人民，在“缩短期限完成第三个五年计划”的战斗口号的鼓舞下，大大发挥了人民的干劲，社会主义的建设速度得到很大提高。完全可以相信，你们会在今后的建设事业中将取得更加辉煌的成就。
    中国共产党和中国人民一向把兄弟的保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民所取得的成就当作自己的成就，并深信这种成就对于我国社会主义建设起着很大的鼓舞作用。在这保加利亚共产党诞生的日子，我们谨祝保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民在进一步发展社会主义建设事业，在巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的事业中，在坚决反对修正主义的斗争中，在保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的斗争中，获得新的更大的成就。
      中国共产党中央委员会　1959年6月4日
