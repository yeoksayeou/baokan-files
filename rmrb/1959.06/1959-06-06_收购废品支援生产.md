Recycling Waste to Support Production

    Ningxia Simultaneously Collects and Processes Waste
    Commercial departments in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are vigorously collecting waste materials. Since spring, nineteen counties (cities) across the region have collected 505 tons of scrap iron and steel and over 80 tons of various non-ferrous metals. The variety of waste materials collected has increased from dozens to hundreds.
    Commercial departments promptly sort or organize the processing of collected waste materials to supply production units. The waste product purchase and sales department of the Yinchuan City Trade Store has established a special warehouse to store waste materials. They then select usable semi-finished products and incomplete sets of screws and parts to supply factories for assembly. Recently, this department selected more than 2,400 catties of hemp fiber from waste materials to supply the infrastructure construction sector and selected over 200 car tires, which were processed and supplied to mining units.

    Old Waste is Taken Away, New Waste Appears
    This year, Yi'an County, Heilongjiang Province, increased its waste product acquisition plan by 69% compared to last year. Some waste product collectors believed that they had already collected all the discarded items that hadn't been touched for years last year, and there wouldn't be much left to acquire this year.
    Zhao Yun, the Secretary of the Yi'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally led the purchasing station manager and purchasing staff to collect waste in the vicinity of the county seat. In less than a day, they collected four large cartloads of waste from four units: the railway station, farms, the Grain Bureau, and the starch factory. This included over 7,800 catties of steel, iron, copper, aluminum, etc., and over 3,000 catties of rags and sacks.
    Facts prove that waste products "come and go." Old waste is collected, and new waste is generated. Waste can never be completely eliminated. (Wang Zhongxin)

    Treasure Box
    In Jinzhou Middle Street, Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, every household has set up a small wooden box at their doorstep, collecting any unused scrap iron, torn shoes and socks, and broken glass shards at any time. An average household accumulates a box every three to five days, which can be sold for several jiao each time. Therefore, the masses have renamed the waste product box the "Treasure Basin."

    Waste Product Counter
    The Jinzhou Department Store has established a "Waste Product Acquisition Counter." Residents can take waste products such as scrap copper and broken iron to the counter at any time to exchange them for various goods they need. (Attached image)

    Staff at the Shanghai Turbine Factory have set up a "Second-hand Shop" in the factory, which can collect scrap copper and iron while also allowing people to select various materials. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhen Ping photographed.

    收购废品支援生产
    宁夏边收购边加工
    宁夏回族自治区各地商业部门大力收购废品，全区十九个县（市）从春季以来，已经收购废钢铁五百零五吨，各种废金属八十多吨。收购废品的品种由几十种增加到几百种。
    商业部门把收购的废品及时整理或组织加工，供给生产单位。银川市贸易商店废品购销门市部，专门建立一个库房存放废品，然后挑选出能用的半成品和不成套的螺丝零件等，供给工厂配制成套。最近，这个门市部从废品中挑选出二千四百多斤麻刀供给了基本建设部门，挑选出二百多条汽车轮胎，经过加工后供给了采矿单位。旧的废品收走了新的废品又出现了
    黑龙江省依安县今年废品收购计划比去年提高了69％。部分废品收购人员认为去年已经把多少年没翻身的破烂东西都收光了，今年不会再有多大油水了。
    中共依安县委书记赵云于是亲自率领采购站经理、采购员等到县城附近去收购，不到一天，就从车站、农场、粮食局、淀粉厂四个单位，收购了四大车废品。其中钢、铁、铜、铝等就有七千八百多斤，破布、麻袋等三千多斤。
    事实证明：废品是“有去有来”的，旧的废品被收走了，新的废品又产生了。废品是永远收不光的。（王衷心）
    聚宝箱
    辽宁省锦州市锦铁中街家家户户门口都设了一个小木箱子，随时随地把家里不用的碎铁片、破鞋烂袜、破玻璃碴子都积攒在这小箱子里。一般人家三、五天就攒一箱，一次就能卖好几角钱。因此，群众把废品箱改名叫“聚宝盆”。
    废品专柜
    锦州市大楼百货商店设立了“废品收购柜台”。居民们可以随时拿一些碎铜破铁等废品，到柜上去换回他们所需要的各种商品。（附图片）
