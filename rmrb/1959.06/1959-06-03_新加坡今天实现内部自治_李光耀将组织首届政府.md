Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 2nd - Singapore's British Governor, Goode, announced today that the Secretary-General of the People's Action Party (PAP) of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, has accepted the invitation to form the first government of Singapore after it achieves internal self-government.

The left-wing opposition party in the previous Legislative Assembly, the People's Action Party, won the first Legislative Assembly election held on May 30th to implement the internal self-government constitution, winning forty-three of the fifty-one seats in the Legislative Assembly.

Goode announced that Singapore's new constitution would be promulgated on the 3rd, and Singapore would officially achieve internal self-government from that day, becoming a nation.

Goode also announced that he had decided to release the eight leaders of the People's Action Party currently in detention on the 4th.

The demand to release these leaders of the People's Action Party was put forward by the People's Action Party as a condition for it to accept the formation of a new government. In August 1957, the Singapore government, then headed by Labour Front leader Lim Yew Hock, invoked the "Public Security Ordinance" under the pretext of "suppressing subversive activities" and arrested more than 30 trade union workers, including former PAP Chairman Tan Chong Tee and former Deputy Secretary-General and Legislative Assembly member Lim Chin Siong. A spokesman for the People's Action Party announced today that an election was held within the People's Action Party last weekend. As a result of the election, the party's leadership personnel remained largely unchanged, with Toh Chin Chye re-elected as Chairman and Lee Kuan Yew re-elected as Secretary-General.

    新加坡今天实现内部自治
    李光耀将组织首届政府
    新华社2日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡的英国总督古德今天宣布，新加坡人民行动党总书记李光耀已经接受了组织新加坡实现内部自治后第一届政府的邀请。
    上届立法议会中的左翼反对党人民行动党在5月30日举行的执行内部自治宪法的第一届立法议会选举中获胜，取得了立法议会五十一个议席中的四十三席。
    古德宣布将在3日颁布新加坡的新宪法，新加坡将从这一天起正式实现内部自治，成为一个国家。
    古德还宣布，他决定在4日释放目前在拘留中的人民行动党的八名领袖。
    释放人民行动党的这些领袖的要求是人民行动党作为它接受组织新政府的条件而向古德提出的。在1957年8月，以前劳工阵线领袖林有福为首的新加坡政府以“镇压颠复活动”为名援引“公共安全法令”逮捕了三十多名工会工作者，其中包括人民行动党前任主席陈从今和前副总书记、立法议员林清祥等领导人。人民行动党的一位发言人今天宣布，上周末人民行动党内举行了一次选举。选举结果，党的领导人员基本上没有变动，杜进才连任主席、李光耀连任总书记。
