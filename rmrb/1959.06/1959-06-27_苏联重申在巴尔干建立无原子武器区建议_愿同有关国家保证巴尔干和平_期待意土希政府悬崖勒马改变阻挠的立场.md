Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: TASS, Moscow, June 25th—The Soviet Foreign Ministry delivered a statement from the Soviet government on guaranteeing peace and security in the Balkans and Adriatic region to the ambassadors of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Greece, Italy, Turkey, the United States, Britain, and France to the Soviet Union, as well as to the acting representatives of Albania and Romania on June 25th, asking them to forward the statement to their respective governments.

The full text of the Soviet government's statement is as follows:

In view of the many discussions by governments and state figures of various countries on the issue of guaranteeing peace and security in the Balkans and Adriatic region, the Soviet government deems it necessary to make the following statement.

As everyone knows, proceeding from the interests of maintaining peace and security in Europe, Khrushchev, the head of the Soviet government, proposed establishing a nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-weapon-free zone in the Balkans and Adriatic region. The recently published Albanian-Soviet joint statement reaffirmed this proposal. The Soviet government is deeply convinced that if the countries in this region refuse to establish nuclear and rocket bases on their territories, it would be in the fundamental interests of the people of these countries and would be a great contribution to the cause of European security and to turning the Balkans and Adriatic into a region of peace and security.

The importance and timeliness of this proposal can be seen from the dangerous situation that has developed in this region that endangers the cause of peace. Under pressure from the United States, the Turkish and Italian governments have agreed to establish American nuclear and rocket bases on their territories and to use the strategic situation of the Balkan Peninsula for aggressive purposes. The Greek government also intends to turn Greece into a nuclear base. The phenomenon of direct threats to peace and security in this region is now more prevalent than ever. Of course, the Soviet Union is a country bordering the Balkan countries and therefore has a direct stake in maintaining and safeguarding peace in the Balkans. It cannot but pay attention to the development of events that are so dangerous to its security. The people of the Balkan countries oppose turning the Balkans into a breeding ground for new wars, and are increasingly actively supporting the establishment of a nuclear-free zone. This sentiment is close to and understandable to the Soviet people.

The Soviet government attaches great importance to the efforts of certain national governments who have consistently and resolutely advocated consolidating peace and promoting the broadest cooperation among the Balkan countries on the principles of equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs.

In this regard, it is impossible not to point out the Romanian government's statement on June 6 this year. In this statement, the Romanian government once again proposed convening a meeting of the heads of government of the Balkan Peninsula countries to study the mature issues related to the countries in this region, including the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-weapon-free zone of peace in the Balkans.

The Soviet government welcomes the statements made by the governments and state figures of the People's Republic of Albania and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, who actively advocate the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans and Adriatic region.

The Soviet government confirms that, as can be seen from the speech made by Josip Broz Tito, President of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, on June 8, 1959, the Yugoslav government also supports the proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans and Adriatic region. The Yugoslav government also believes that the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Balkan region would be most effective if all countries of the Balkan Peninsula and Italy participated in the nuclear-free zone.

However, the Soviet government regrets to point out that the most serious obstacles to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone are the positions of the Italian, Turkish and Greek governments. Under the current circumstances, when most Balkan countries advocate the establishment of a nuclear-free zone, it can be expected that the Italian, Turkish and Greek governments will listen to the reasonable calls of their neighbors and their own people, and change their position on this issue before it is too late.

As for the statements by some national governments that their national security cannot be adequately guaranteed under such circumstances, it should be pointed out that the concerns involving the Soviet part are without any basis. The Soviet government believes that the issue of establishing a nuclear-free zone should also not be altered by the fact that the countries that sign the agreement on the nuclear-free zone are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or members of the Warsaw Treaty.

The Soviet government is convinced that the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans and Adriatic region is a major contribution to easing international tensions and consolidating peace and security in Europe. The Soviet government declares that it is willing to become a guarantor of this region, along with other major powers.

The Soviet government calls on the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to do everything possible to promote the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans and Adriatic region, and, in the event that an agreement is reached between the countries concerned on this issue, to guarantee the security and independence of the member states of the aforementioned region together with the Soviet Union.

The Soviet government hopes that the countries related to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans and Adriatic region will give due attention to the opinions put forward in the statement.

### 苏联重申在巴尔干建立无原子武器区建议  愿同有关国家保证巴尔干和平  期待意土希政府悬崖勒马改变阻挠的立场

    苏联重申在巴尔干建立无原子武器区建议
    愿同有关国家保证巴尔干和平
    期待意土希政府悬崖勒马改变阻挠的立场
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：苏联外交部6月25日将苏联政府就保障巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区和平和安全问题所发表的一项声明分别交给了保加利亚、南斯拉夫、希腊、意大利、土耳其、美国、英国和法国驻苏联的大使，以及阿尔巴尼亚和罗马尼亚的临时代办，并请他们将这项声明转交给各国政府。
    苏联政府的声明全文如下：
    鉴于许多国家的政府和国家活动家就保障巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区的和平和安全问题发表了许多谈话，苏联政府认为有必要作如下声明。
    大家知道，从维护欧洲和平和安全的利益出发，苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫曾建议在巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区建立无原子武器和无火箭武器区。不久前发表的阿尔巴尼亚—苏联联合声明重申了这个建议。苏联政府深信，这一地区的各国若是拒绝在本国领土上设置原子基地和火箭基地，会符合这些国家人民的切身利益，并且是对欧洲安全事业和变巴尔干和亚得里亚海为和平与安全地区的事业的巨大贡献。
    从目前这一地区内形成的危害和平事业的危险局势中，可以看出这一建议的重要性和适时性。在美国的压力之下，土耳其和意大利政府同意在本国领土上建立美国原子基地和火箭基地，并利用巴尔干半岛的战略形势为侵略目的服务。希腊政府还打算把希腊变成原子基地。目前这一地区出现的直接威胁和平和安全的现象比任何时候都多。当然，苏联是同巴尔干国家相毗连的国家，因而，它与保持和维护巴尔干和平问题有着直接的利害关系，它不能不重视对它的安全来说是如此危险的事件的发展情况。巴尔干各国人民反对变巴尔干为新战争的策源地，并越来越积极地支持建立无原子区的主张。他们这种心情，对苏联人民来说是亲近的，可以理解的。
    苏联政府十分重视某些国家政府的努力，这些国家一贯坚决主张巩固和平，主张在平等、互相尊重和互不干涉内政的原则下，在巴尔干各国间进行最广泛的合作。
    在这一点上，不能不指出罗马尼亚政府今年6月6日的声明。在这项声明中罗马尼亚政府再一次建议召开巴尔干半岛各国政府首脑会议，来研究同这一地区国家有关的业已成熟的问题，其中也要讨论在巴尔干建立无原子武器和无火箭武器和平区的建议。
    苏联政府欢迎积极主张在巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区建立无原子区的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和保加利亚人民共和国政府和国家活动家的声明。
    苏联政府确认，从南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统约瑟夫·布罗兹·铁托1959年6月8日的演说中可以看出，南斯拉夫政府也支持在巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区建立无原子区的建议。南斯拉夫政府还认为，如果巴尔干半岛所有国家和意大利都参加无原子区的话，那么，在巴尔干地区建立无原子区是最为有效的。
    但是，苏联政府遗憾地指出，在建立无原子区问题上最严重的障碍是意大利、土耳其和希腊政府的立场。在目前情况下，当大多数巴尔干国家都主张建立无原子区的时候，可以期待意大利、土耳其和希腊政府听取邻国和本国人民合理的呼声，趁此为时还不算晚之际，改变自己在这个问题上的立场。
    至于某些国家政府声明，好像在这种情况下，它们国家的安全不能得到足够的保障，那么，对此应当指出，那种涉及苏联部分的担心是没有任何根据的。苏联政府认为，建立无原子区的问题也不应该由下列情况为转移，即签订关于无原子区协定的国家是北大西洋公约组织成员国，还是华沙条约成员国。
    苏联政府坚信，在巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区建立无原子区是对缓和国际紧张局势及巩固欧洲和平和安全事业的巨大贡献。苏联政府声明，它愿意同其他大国一起，成为这一地区的保证人。
    苏联政府号召美国、英国和法国政府竭尽一切可能促使在巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区建立无原子区，并在有关国家之间就这一问题达成协议的情况下，和苏联一起保证上述地区成员国的安全和独立。
    苏联政府希望那些同建立巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区无原子区有关的国家，对声明中所提出的意见给以应有的注意。
