    The "Revolution" of the Palm Leaf Fan
    By Our Correspondent Zhao Ying
    In Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, the home of the palm leaf fan, the dense layers of green leaves on the palm trees sway gently. They are picked and made into palm leaf fans, which people use to create a refreshing breeze that dispels the summer heat.
    However, not long ago, the makers of these palm leaf fans, which provide cooling relief, had to shed a lot of sweat to produce them. Each ordinary palm leaf fan had to go through more than a dozen complicated processes and take about ten days to become a finished product. This not only increased the workers' labor intensity but also delayed the opportunity for the fans to provide cooling relief.
    In the great surge of the Great Leap Forward, the people producing palm leaf fans underwent a "great revolution" and achieved victory. The Party General Branch Secretary of the Palm Leaf Industry Company recounted some interesting episodes from this "revolution": To make a palm leaf fan, the palm leaves must first be cut into the shape of a fan. In the past, it took three to four years, or even seven to eight years, to learn how to cut the palm leaves into the shape of a fan using heavy shears weighing one and a half pounds. A worker could cut about a thousand fans a day, but his hands would be so tired that he couldn't lift them. "How wonderful it would be to have a fan-cutting machine to replace manual labor!" During the Great Leap Forward, the workers of the palm leaf fan factory, with this desire in mind, went to a machine factory in the county, but the factory replied that it couldn't be done. They then went to a factory in Guangzhou, which said that the machine would weigh two thousand pounds and cost three thousand yuan. That wouldn't work either. What to do? The leaders of the palm leaf fan factory mobilized the workers to make it themselves. At this time, a worker named Wang Zhenpeng from the No. 1 Palm Leaf Fan Factory boldly proposed using wood to make a mold frame and then attaching blades to press and cut the fans. After repeated experiments, they really did make a fan-cutting machine out of wood and saw blades. It only cost a few dozen yuan, but the efficiency was doubled.
    This achievement illuminated the path for palm leaf fan workers to rely on their own efforts to carry out technical innovation. Three thousand workers throughout the county competed to change backward manual operations. In the Palm Leaf Comprehensive Processing Factory, the reporter saw a hot air furnace made of bricks, wood, and old iron wire. Don't look down on it; it can replace the backbreaking roasting process. Originally, palm leaf fans had to be roasted to be oily, smooth, and crisp. In the past, the operators stood by the high-temperature furnace, roasting each fan one by one. The heat was oppressive, and it was extremely hard work. In the technical innovation, this factory and workers from other factories learned from each other and developed this hot air furnace. During operation, the fans are moved through the hot air furnace with a conveyor belt by manually cranking the machine, completing the process. The efficiency is more than doubled compared to the past. The workers said easily and with emotion, "This is truly a happy furnace under the leadership of the Party!" In the fire painting process, workers are using electric pens to paint beautiful landscapes and patterns on the fans. When the reporter asked about the use of electric pens, Zhao Zhan, an old worker who had been painting fans for thirty-eight years, took out an iron pen and said to the reporter: In the past, this iron pen, weighing more than ten taels, was heated over a fire and then used to paint. Looking at this iron pen covered with a layer of rust, and then looking at the electric pen they are using now, who can say that this is not the most vivid contrast?
    In another workshop, sewing machines were humming. It turned out that the work of sewing the edges of fans, which used to require a large number of women to do by hand, has now been replaced by machines, which can improve efficiency sixfold. In addition, even the work of bundling the fans has been automated with bundling machines. These reforms have changed the backward state of palm leaf fan production and have brought about tremendous changes in production. The statistics from the county's Palm Leaf Industry Company are the best proof. Since last year, the workers have created and improved 48 major tools, increasing efficiency by several to dozens of times. A total of 1.84 million work hours have been reduced throughout the year, saving approximately 1,500 laborers. As a result, last year's output increased by 19.91%, the number of high-quality fans increased by 20%, and costs decreased by 9%.
    Yes, these reforms not only created new working conditions for palm leaf industry workers but also mean manufacturing more and better palm leaf fans, bringing coolness to a large number of consumers.

### 葵扇的“革命”

    葵扇的“革命”
    本报记者　赵颖
    在葵扇的家乡——广东新会县，葵树上，密密层层的绿叶轻轻摆动。它们被采下来，制成葵扇，人们使着它，凉风飕飕，暑气顿消。
    可是，在不久以前，就是这些给人搧风送凉的葵扇，制造者为生产它们却要流下不少的汗水。每一柄普通的葵扇，都要经过十几道繁琐的工序；要十天左右的时间，才能变为成品。这样，不仅增加了工人的劳动强度，也耽搁了扇子为人送凉的时机。
    在大跃进的巨流里，生产葵扇的人们来了个“大革命”，而且获得了胜利。葵业公司党总支书记讲述了这次“革命”中的几段有意思的事情：制葵扇必须先把葵叶剪成扇子形状，在从前，干这道工序得学上三、四年甚至七、八年，才能用重一斤半的大剪刀把葵叶剪成扇子形状。一个工人一天剪一千柄左右，便把手累得抬不起来了。“要有一部剪扇机代替手工有多么好！”大跃进中，葵扇厂职工抱着这个愿望去找县里的一家机械厂，厂里回答说，没法做；他们又跑到广州一家工厂去，那个厂说这个机器造出来要两千斤重，价值三千元。也不成。怎么办呢？葵扇厂的领导就发动职工自己来做。这时葵扇一厂有一个叫汪振鹏的工人，他大胆提出了要用木头做模架，再按上刀片来压剪扇子的建议。经过大家反复试验，真的用木头加锯片造出了一台剪扇机。才花了几十元，而效率却提高了一倍。
    这个成就照亮了葵扇工人自力更生搞技术革新的道路，全县三千名工人，竞相改变落后的手工操作。在葵叶综合加工厂里，记者看到一台用砖、木头、旧铁丝等造成的热风炉体，别瞧不起它，它能代替使人汗流浃背的焙烧工序。原来葵扇必须经过火烤，才能油润、脆嫩；过去操作工人站在高温的炉边一柄柄地烤，热气迫人，辛苦非常，在技术革新中，这个厂和别的厂的工人互相学习研究，制成了这个热风炉，操作时，用手摇动机器，扇子就随传送带通过热风炉，完成了这道工序。效率比过去提高一倍以上。工人们轻松而又感慨地说：“真是党领导下的幸福炉呀！”在火画工序，工人们正在用电笔在扇上画美丽的山水、花纹。记者问起电笔使用情况时，画了三十八年扇子的老工人赵沾找出一把铁笔对记者说：从前是用这条十多两重的铁笔在火上烤红了再画的。看看这支上了一层铁锈的铁笔，再望望现在他们用的电笔，谁能说这不是最鲜明的对比？
    在另外一个车间里，缝纫机在沙沙的响，原来从前要有大批妇女用针缝扇边的工作，现在已经有机器来代替了，它可以提高效率六倍。此外，就连捆扎扇子的工作也用上了捆扇机。这些改革改变了葵扇生产的落后面貌，在生产上发生了巨大变化。县里葵业公司的统计材料便是最好的证明。去年以来，职工们创造改良的主要工具有四十八项，提高工效几倍到几十倍，全年一共压缩工时一百八十四万个，节约劳动力约一千五百多人。因此去年的产量提高了19.91％，上等扇增加了20％，成本降低了9％。
    是的，这些改革不仅为葵业工人创造了崭新的劳动条件，而且也意味着制造更多更好的葵扇，把凉爽带给众多的消费者。
