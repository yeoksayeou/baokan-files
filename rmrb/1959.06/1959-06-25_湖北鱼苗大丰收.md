Hubei Achieves a Bumper Harvest of Fish Fry
Hubei Province has achieved an unprecedentedly abundant harvest of fish fry this year. From late April to mid-June, the province collected a total of 20 billion natural fish fry along the Yangtze and Han rivers and artificially hatched carp fry in various localities. This is equivalent to 136 percent of the total fish fry production for the entire previous year.
