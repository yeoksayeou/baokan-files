    Against the Bloody Suppression by the Authorities
    Ecuadorian People Demonstrate for Days
    Quito Dispatch: Ecuadorian President Ponce Enríquez, in a cabinet meeting held before dawn on June 3, declared a nationwide "state of emergency."

    It is reported that the imposition of martial law was triggered by a student march and demonstration in Guayaquil, Ecuador's second-largest city, on the evening of June 2. According to reports, on May 29, armed clashes occurred between recruits and regular troops in Puerto Viejo, lasting eight hours, during which seven people were killed and twenty-five were injured, including some students. Following the clashes, students from secondary schools and law schools in Guayaquil went on strike, demanding the resignation of the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Education, and the Chief of Police of Guayas Province. At 10:00 PM on the evening of June 2, students held a meeting that was attacked by the police. Subsequently, many students and citizens occupied a building under construction opposite the "El Telégrafo" newspaper office. The military commander of Guayas Province sent police and troops to disperse the demonstrators with rifles and tear gas. Five people were killed and more than thirty were injured in the clashes. Afterwards, troops and tanks patrolled the streets. According to reports, President Ponce Enríquez, while declaring martial law, dismissed the Chief of Police of Guayas Province.

    After the declaration of martial law, Guayaquil remained in turmoil. According to reports, new demonstrations broke out in Guayaquil on the evening of June 3. Groups of citizens attacked and set fire to the Security Department office. Reinforcements of troops and tanks arrived, firing on the citizens and dispersing them. Fifteen more people were killed and sixty were injured in the clashes. According to reports, the Ecuadorian government ordered the army and navy to control the port of Guayaquil to prevent further demonstrations. The authorities also adopted news blockade measures, ordering radio stations to broadcast only official communiqués. Sources say that the events of the evening of June 3 were led by Carlos Guevara Moreno, leader of the opposition party "Concentration of Popular Forces."

    The Ecuadorian Communist Party condemned the actions of the Ecuadorian President as violating the constitution and legal provisions. It issued a declaration stating, "The streets of Puerto Viejo and Guayaquil are stained with the blood of students, the sons of the heroic people. They sacrificed themselves under the criminal suppression of the conservative government led by Ponce." The Ecuadorian Communist Party called for "organizing a strong United Front of Popular Democracy to prevent dictatorship."

    反对当局的血腥镇压
    厄瓜多尔人民连日示威
    本报讯　基多消息：厄瓜多尔总统庞塞·安利格斯在6月3日黎明以前举行的一次内阁会议上，宣布全国处于“紧急状态”。
    据报道，这次宣布戒严是2日晚厄瓜多尔第二大城市瓜亚基尔学生游行示威引起的。消息说，5月29日，维霍港的新兵和正规军发生了历时八小时的武装冲突，当时有七人被击毙，二十五人受伤，其中还包括一些学生。冲突发生后，瓜亚基尔中等学校和法律学校的学生即举行罢课，要求国防部长、教育部长和瓜亚斯省警察局长辞职。2日晚十点钟，学生们举行了一次会议，遭到警察的袭击，随后，许多学生和市民占领了“电讯报”报馆对面正在建筑的一幢建筑物。瓜亚斯省的军事司令派来警察和军队用步枪和催泪瓦斯把示威群众驱散。在这场冲突中有五人被击毙，三十多人受伤。事后还出动了军队和坦克在各街道巡逻。消息说，庞塞·安利格斯总统在宣布戒严的同时，解除了瓜亚斯省警察局长的职务。
    在宣布戒严后，瓜亚基尔仍处于动乱中。据报道，3日晚，瓜亚基尔又发生了新的示威运动。成群结队的市民攻打并放火焚烧保安部办事处，增援的部队和坦克赶到，向市民射击并把他们驱散。在这次冲突中又有十五人被击毙，六十人受伤。消息说，厄瓜多尔政府命令陆军和海军来控制瓜亚基尔港，以防止再度发生示威运动。官方并且采取封锁新闻措施，命令各电台只许播发官方的公报。有消息说，3日晚的事件，是由反对党“人民力量集中党”领袖卡洛斯·格瓦拉·莫雷诺领导的。
    厄瓜多尔共产党谴责厄瓜多尔总统的违反宪法和法律规定的行动。并发表宣言指出，“维霍港和瓜亚基尔的街道上沾染了学生、英勇的人民的儿子的血。他们在由庞塞领导的保守政府的罪恶镇压下牺牲了。”厄瓜多尔共产党号召“组织一支壮大的人民民主联合阵线来防止独裁政权”。
