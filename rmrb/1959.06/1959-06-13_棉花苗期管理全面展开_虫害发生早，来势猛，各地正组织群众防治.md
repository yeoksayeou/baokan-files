Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: A cotton seedling management campaign aimed at ensuring full stands and promoting early cotton development, striving for more pre-summer bolls, has been vigorously launched in all cotton-producing areas. Cotton farmers are inspecting, replanting, and thinning seedlings, intensifying mid-tillage and topdressing, and fighting against pests such as aphids.

The national cotton sowing was basically completed by the end of May, and cotton seedlings grown for transplantation are being transplanted. Due to the promotion of cotton high-yield experiences from the Great Leap Forward last year, and further improvements in sowing quality, most cotton seedlings are emerging and growing better this year than last year. In the south, early-sown and transplanted cotton seedlings have grown five to seven true leaves, and some have begun to bud. Early-sown cotton in Yuanjiang and Yuanmou, Yunnan, has already formed bolls. Cotton seedlings in the Yellow River cotton region have also grown two to four true leaves and are growing vigorously.

As soon as cotton sowing ended, various localities universally launched inspection, replanting, and mid-tillage, topdressing, and other tasks. After a comprehensive inspection and replanting of seedlings in Henan Province, all cotton fields have basically achieved full stands. In the suburbs of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, 210,000 mu of cotton fields with missing seedlings have also been completely replanted and re-sown. As of the end of May, mid-tillage and weeding have been universally carried out once in most areas, and some cotton fields are undergoing the second and third rounds of mid-tillage and weeding. Topdressing during the seedling stage has also begun in various localities. Yunnan Province has universally applied fertilizer once; according to a survey of seven cotton-producing counties in Henan Province, 20% of cotton fields have been topdressed once during the seedling stage. To meet the needs of topdressing during the seedling stage, many areas have proposed launching a fertilizer accumulation campaign after the wheat harvest.

The thinning of cotton seedlings has begun in most cotton-growing areas. During thinning, various localities are paying attention to rational close planting. Many areas have proposed "three-carry" thinning, that is, carrying a ruler, a basket, and pesticide, thinning seedlings while controlling pests, taking the thinned cotton seedlings out of the field, and evenly retaining seedlings to ensure the predetermined density. In Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan, the area of cotton fields where seedlings were thinned using rulers and manual methods accounted for 92% of the thinned area, and the density was mostly above 4,000 plants. In order to achieve the standard of rational close planting, the leading organs of Shandong Province called for an "insurance coefficient" of 5%-10% when thinning seedlings to ensure the final number of harvested plants.

This year, cotton pests have appeared earlier and more aggressively. In addition to advocating the application of 666 powder in conjunction with thinning seedlings, various localities have begun spraying pesticides for prevention and control. In Huojia County, Henan Province, 290,000 people and 19,000 sprayers were mobilized to carry out a concentrated campaign to control aphids. Cixi County, Zhejiang, is launching a massive campaign to eliminate insects and protect cotton seedlings. Every day, 50,000 people in the county participate in insect control, and 68,000 mu of land have been treated with pesticides in five days. Liyuan Commune in Nangong County, Hebei Province, organized a professional insect control army of more than 5,400 people, and has now basically eliminated cotton aphids. (Attached image)

### 棉花苗期管理全面展开  虫害发生早，来势猛，各地正组织群众防治

    棉花苗期管理全面展开
    虫害发生早，来势猛，各地正组织群众防治
    据新华社10日讯　一个以保证全苗和促使棉花提早发育、力争多座伏前桃的棉花苗期管理运动，已在各产棉区蓬勃展开。各地棉农正在进行查苗、补苗、定苗，加紧中耕、追肥，并同蚜虫等虫害展开了斗争。
    全国棉花播种在5月末已经基本结束，育苗移栽的棉花正在进行移栽。由于推广了去年大跃进中棉花丰产经验，进一步提高了播种质量，今年大部棉花出苗和生长情况比去年还好。南方早播种的和育苗移栽的棉花已经长出五到七片真叶，有的已经开始现蕾。云南元江、元谋等地早播的棉花已经结铃。黄河流域棉区的棉苗，也已长出两片到四片真叶，生长茁壮。
    棉花播种刚一结束，各地普遍展开了查苗、补苗和中耕、追肥等工作。河南省经过全面查苗补苗，全部棉田已经基本上达到了全苗。陕西省西安市郊缺苗棉田二十一万亩，也全部进行了补苗和补种。截至5月底大部地区棉田已经普遍中耕锄草一遍，部分棉田正在进行第二次和第三次中耕除草。各地苗期追肥也已开始，云南省已普遍追肥一次；河南省据七个产棉县的调查，已有20％棉田追了一次苗期肥。为了满足苗期追肥需要，不少地区提出在麦后开展一次积肥运动。
    大部棉区的棉花定苗工作已经开始。在定苗工作中各地都很注意合理密植，很多地区提出“三带”定苗，即带尺、带篮、带药，边定苗边治虫，将间下的棉苗带出田外，并均匀留苗保证预定密度。河南新乡专区用尺量手定苗的面积占已定苗面积的92％，密度大部在四千株以上。为了达到合理密植的标准，山东省领导机关号召在定苗时要打5％—10％的保险系数，以保证最后的收获株数。
    今年棉花虫害发生较早而且来势较猛。各地除提倡结合定苗撒六六六粉防治以外，已经开始喷药防治。河南省获嘉县出动了二十九万人，一万九千部喷雾器，突击防治蚜虫。浙江慈溪县正开展一个声势浩大的棉花除虫保苗运动，全县每天有五万人参加治虫，五天中就用药剂防治虫害六万八千亩。河北南宫县梨园公社，组织了五千四百多人的除虫专业大军，现在已把棉蚜基本消灭。（附图片）
