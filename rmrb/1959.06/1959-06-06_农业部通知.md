Xinhua News Agency, 5th -- The Ministry of Agriculture issued an urgent notice at 12 o'clock on the night of the 4th, requiring areas currently harvesting summer crops to immediately take measures to prevent rain damage, and to harvest, thresh, transport, purchase, and store summer crops well.

    The notice said: According to weather forecasts, from the 5th to the 9th, there will be rain in most parts of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi. In order to prevent wheat from being damaged by rain, all localities should:

    I. Organize harvesting in batches. First harvest the early-maturing varieties that are prone to shattering and germination, and then harvest the late-maturing varieties that are not prone to shattering and germination. First harvest wheat fields that may accumulate water. During continuous rain, the method of cutting wheat ears can be adopted to ensure that no grain is lost.

    II. Seize sunny days to harvest, thresh, and transport simultaneously. Wheat that cannot be threshed in time should be stacked and covered in higher areas, and checked frequently to prevent rain, heat, germination, and mildew. Harvest promptly and transport it indoors to spread out and dry on rainy days.

    III. Seize the time to thresh. If the threshing ground cannot be used due to rain, members can be organized to thresh indoors to avoid mildew and germination due to prolonged stacking. For threshed wet wheat, use methods such as airing, drying, and baking to reduce moisture. Wheat ears stacked indoors that have not yet been threshed should also be turned and aired frequently.

    IV. During the wheat harvest period, pay close attention to the weather, be prepared at all times, and fight against wind and rain disasters in a timely manner according to local weather forecasts.

    V. Areas where the wheat harvest has ended should seize the time to take advantage of the soil moisture and rush to plant.

    农业部通知
    新华社5日讯　农业部4日夜十二时发出紧急通知，要求正在收打夏收作物的地区，立即采取措施，防止雨害，收好、打好、运好、购好、藏好夏收作物。
    通知说：据气象预报，5日到9日江苏、安徽、河南、河北、山东、山西大部地区有雨。为了防止小麦因雨受到损失，各地应：
    一、组织分批抢收。先割成熟早的容易落粒发芽的品种，后割成熟迟的不易落粒发芽的品种。先收可能积水的麦田。在连阴雨时，可采用割麦穗的办法，做到颗粒不丢。
    二、要抢晴天边收边打边运。来不及打的麦子，要在较高的场地上垛好、盖好，并且随时检查，防止雨淋，不让麦子发热、发芽、霉烂等。雨天抢收要及时运回室内，摊开晾干。
    三、抓紧时间脱粒。如因雨不能打场，可组织社员在室内脱粒，以免堆放过久霉烂发芽。对于脱粒的湿麦，要采用晾、炕、烘等办法减少水分。在室内堆放未及脱粒的麦穗也要经常翻晾。
    四、麦收期间要密切注意天时，随时准备，根据当地气象预报，及时与风雨灾害作斗争。
    五、麦收结束的地区要抓紧时间趁墒抢种。
