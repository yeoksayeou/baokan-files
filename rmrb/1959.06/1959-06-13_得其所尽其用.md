Editor's Note:

    The commercial departments of Guangxi, based on the characteristics of the region, the size of the population, the level of purchasing power, and other factors, rationally allocate and transfer goods, so that various commodities are put to their proper use and make the most of their value. This is a good way to proactively solve the market supply and demand relationship.

    People's needs for materials are constantly growing. How can we meet these ever-growing needs? The most fundamental way is to increase production. However, if materials are not arranged reasonably, even if a lot is produced, a situation of supply falling short of demand will appear in the market. This is because different regions have different needs. The things that urban people need daily may not be exactly what rural people need; what the South needs may not be what the North needs; and the needs of people in mountainous and coastal areas are also different. Therefore, commercial departments must allocate goods according to these characteristics. Otherwise, artificial supply and demand imbalances will easily occur, and some commodities will be stockpiled or even wasted.

    From this, it can be seen that the allocation and distribution of commodities is a major matter relating to the people's livelihood and production, and should not be taken lightly.

    得其所尽其用
    广西商业部门根据地区特点，人口多寡、购买力高低等情况，合理地分配和调拨商品，使种种商品各得其所，各尽其用，这是主动解决市场供求关系的一个好方法。
    人们对物资的需要是不断增长的。怎样才能满足人们这种日益增长的需要？最根本的办法是增加生产。但是，如果物资摆布的不合理，即使生产得很多，市场上也会出现供不应求的现象。因为地区不同，需求各异。城市人民日常所需用的东西，未必是农村人民所完全需要的；南方所需要的东西，未必是北方所需要的；山区和沿海地区人民的需要也不尽相同。因此，商业部门必须根据这些特点调拨商品。否则，就容易出现人为的供求失调现象，一些商品就会被积压下来，甚至造成浪费。
  由此可见，商品的调拨摆布，是关系人民生活，关系生产的一件大事，不可等闲视之。
