    Random Thoughts on Reading
    Lu Ge
    The eleventh issue of "Red Flag" has a short essay calling on everyone to conscientiously read more books. This call is very important. However, the number of books available is so vast, as some have described, like "an endless sea." Anyone would only be able to read a very small portion of them in their entire life, especially considering that we have limited time to sit down and read amidst our busy work and lives. So, what books should we actually read?
    Some say, "Opening a book is beneficial," and reading any book will be useful. Of course, every book has its value. Some books can directly educate us, some can serve as materials to enrich our knowledge, and some can even serve as negative examples. The British Factory Inspector's Blue Book was used by members of Parliament as shooting targets or sold as waste paper, which can be said to be of no use, but Marx studied it in detail, thus helping him write a chapter of "Das Kapital." It can be seen that any book can be useful, and opening a book is always beneficial.
    However, to gain benefit and find use from any book, one must have the correct stance, viewpoint, method, and keen analytical ability, which is not something everyone can do. For the average reader, reading bad books not only wastes time but can also be poisonous. Especially for young students, the content of the books is even more important to their physical and mental health because they are in the process of learning.
    Of course, in our country's current situation, there are not many books that are very harmful to read, but we should still choose the books that are most beneficial to us, especially for young students.
    Therefore, under the slogan of conscientiously reading more books, we must conscientiously do a good job in book review work to help everyone read more good books. This is a very important task for the cultural publishing industry. And it is also essential for teachers to strengthen guidance on students' extracurricular reading.

    Some people like to read literary works from the May Fourth period, but instead of understanding the spirit and progressive significance of the works from the social environment at the time, they specialize in finding liberalism, individual heroism, and pessimistic and world-weary sentiments in them.
    Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth applicable everywhere, and everyone should read it, and everyone can gain many benefits from it. But some people read it with a dogmatic attitude, and as a result, these one hundred percent good books are of no benefit to them.
    Therefore, correcting our reading attitude and developing our correct stance, viewpoint, and method will not only enable us to identify the quality of books, but also enable us to gain more benefits from reading good books. Even if we read bad books, we can analyze and study them and use them as negative examples. But to make our stance, viewpoint, and method correct, reading more good books is an important way. There is a dialectical relationship of mutual cause and effect between the two.

    Are all books useful? Not necessarily.
    Of course, there are very few books that are completely useless to everyone, but not all books are useful to everyone. Some books are useful to one person, but may not be useful to another. Therefore, when reading, we must also make choices according to our individual needs, and we cannot just pick up any book and read it.
    However, we cannot limit our reading to a very narrow range of what we need directly in front of us. The development of modern science has expanded the connections between various sciences, and there are some books that should be read regardless of what problem we are studying or what work we are engaged in, such as the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and literary works, etc. We must develop our knowledge in both broad and profound directions. Marx not only studied books on philosophy, economics, history, and natural science, but was also a literature lover, reading many poems and novels, and he had great interest in the works of Shakespeare and Balzac. If our cadres can learn some natural science and technology science, some philosophy and political economy, some history and law, some literature, some grammar and logic, and some foreign languages, instead of being limited to the narrow scope of their own business, it would be beneficial.
    First, we must study in depth the books in our business area, and second, we must read various books widely. Reading extensively without focusing on our own work will inevitably lead to shallowness and uselessness; specializing in books in our own field while ignoring the expansion of our knowledge through extensive reading will inevitably lead to short-sightedness. Breadth and depth should be given equal importance, and we must also "walk on two legs" in the matter of reading.

    杂谈读书
    鲁歌
    “红旗”第十一期上有一篇短论，要求大家认真地多读些书。这个号召是十分重要的。但是，现有书籍之多，正如有人形容所说：“浩如烟海”，任何人穷毕生之力，也只能读其中很小一部分，更何况我们在紧张的工作、生活中，坐下来读书的时间终究有限。那么，我们究竟应该读些什么书呢？
    有人说，“开卷有益”，不论读什么书，都会有用处。当然，任何书都有它一定的价值，有的书可以直接从其中受到教育，有的书可以作为资料来丰富自己的知识，有的书还可以作为反面教材。英国工厂视察员报告的蓝皮书，是被议员们拿来当作手枪射击靶子或当作废纸出卖的，可说没有什么用了，但马克思却详细地研究了它，因而帮助他写出了“资本论”的一章。可见，什么书都可以有用，开卷必然有益。
    但是，要从任何书中都能得到益处，都能找到用处，必须具有正确的立场、观点、方法和敏锐的分析能力，不是随便什么人都可以做到的。对于一般读者，如果读了不好的书，不但浪费了光阴，而且也会中毒。特别是青年学生，由于他们正在学习过程中，书的内容好坏对于他们身心健康的影响就更为重要。
    当然，在我国目前情况下，使人读了非常有害的书不多了，但我们仍然应该挑选对自己最有益的书来读，特别是青年学生们。
    因此，在认真地多读些书的口号下，我们必须认真地做好书刊评介工作，来帮助大家多读些好书。这是文化出版界一个非常重要的任务。而教师们加强对学生课外阅读的指导也是十分必要的。

    有的人喜欢读五四时期的文学作品，但不从当时的社会环境去了解作品的精神和进步意义，却专在其中找寻自由主义、个人英雄主义和悲观厌世的情调。
    马克思列宁主义，这是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，人人都应该读，人人都可以从其中得到许多益处的。但是有人用教条主义的态度去读它，结果这些百分之百的好书，对于他并没有什么益处。
    因此，端正读书态度，锻炼自己正确的立场、观点和方法，就不但能够识别书的好坏，而且也可以做到读好书得到更多益处，即使读了坏书，也可以进行分析研究，作为反面教材加以运用。但要使自己立场、观点、方法正确，多读好书又是一条重要途径。二者之间，又有着互为因果的辩证关系。

    是不是所有的书都有用呢？也不尽然。
    当然，对于一切人都全无用处的书是很少的，但是，并不是所有的书对于任何人都有用处。有的书对这个人有用，对另一人就未必有用。因此，读书，也要根据个人的需要加以选择，不能信手拈来，见书就看。
    但是，我们也不能把读书限制在自己眼前直接需要的十分狭窄的范围里。现代科学的发展使各门科学之间的关联更加扩大了，而且有些书是不论研究什么问题、从事哪一行工作都应该看的，例如马列主义基本理论和文学作品等等。我们必须使自己的知识向着既广博而又精深两方面发展。马克思不但攻读哲学、经济学、历史学和自然科学方面的书籍，而且也是一个文学爱好者，读了许多诗和小说，莎士比亚、巴尔扎克的作品他都有极大的兴趣。如果我们的干部能够学点自然科学和技术科学，学点哲学和政治经济学，学点历史和法学，学点文学，学点文法和逻辑，学点外国文，而不限于自己业务所及的狭小范围，那是有好处的。
    首先要精读自己业务范围的书，其次要广泛阅读各种书籍。博览群书而不用心钻研本业务，必致空疏无用；专攻本行书籍而忽视通过广泛地阅读书籍来扩大自己知识范围，必致目光短浅。广博与精深应该并重，在读书问题上也是要“两条腿走路”的。
