    The Affectionate Great Hornbill
    Zhang Jiecun

    If you were "Nuo Ge Kan," I would stare at you with wide eyes. If I couldn't see "Nuo Ge Kan," my eyes would no longer be precious to me.

    The Dai people of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, sing of "Nuo Ge Kan" in their folk songs like this.

    "Nuo Ge Kan" is Dai language, meaning golden bird, referring to the Great Hornbill. This is a rare bird, and the Dai people sing about it for good reason. Its body is very large, some reaching 145 centimeters in length, and its spongy keratin beak accounts for one-sixth of its body length. But the most striking feature is the spongy keratin casque on its forehead, which looks like a pair of pointed horns from a distance. It is because of this that people call it the "Great Hornbill." Its upper beak and the sides of the casque are golden, the top of the casque and the area between the beak are orange, the back of the beak and the back of the casque are greenish-black, and the lower beak is milky white. With its snow-white neck, jet-black body, and golden feathers, it is indeed beautiful and unique.

    The Dai people sing about it not only because of its beauty, but mainly because of its devotion. In a pair of "Nuo Ge Kan," whether it is the male or the female, if one is harmed, the other will starve to death, living and dying together without exception. Every year between February and April, when the female bird is about to incubate eggs, the male bird goes around collecting the sap of large banyan trees and mud and stones to seal the tree hole, leaving only a small opening. Every day, it brings the fruit of the banyan tree and feeds it to its mate through the small hole until the little "Nuo Ge Kan" are born.

    The Great Hornbill is a tropical rare bird. Besides Xishuangbanna, it is only found in India, Burma, Vietnam, and Malaysia, and the numbers are not large.

    钟情的双角犀鸟
    章皆淳
    假如你是“糯歌坎”呵，我要睁大眼睛把你呆看。看不到“糯歌坎”呵，眼睛对我也不再稀罕。
    云南西双版纳的傣族人民在民歌里这样歌唱着“糯歌坎”。
    “糯歌坎”是傣族话，意思是黄金鸟，指的是大犀鸟。这是一种珍奇的鸟，傣族人民这样歌唱它不是没有缘故的。它的身体很大，有的长达一百四十五公分，海棉角质的嘴巴要占去体长的六分之一。而最引人注意的还是额前那块海棉角质的顶盔，远远看去就像一对尖起的双角。也就是这个缘故，人们叫它作“双角犀鸟”。它的上颚和顶盔的侧面作黄金色，盔顶和啄间作橙色，啄背和盔后作绿黑色，下颚作乳白色，雪白的颈顶，漆黑的身子，再加上黄金色的羽毛，确是漂亮、别致。
    傣族人民歌唱它，不只是因为它的美丽，主要还是因为它的钟情。在一对“糯歌坎”中，不论是雄的也好，雌的也好，如果有一只被伤害了，另一只也就绝食而死，同生同死，决不例外。每当2——4月间雌鸟要孵卵时，雄鸟就四外去衔大青树浆和泥土石块，把树洞封起来，只留一个小口。它每天把大青树的果子衔来，从小洞里喂到妻子的嘴里，直到小“糯歌坎”出世。
    大犀鸟是一种热带珍禽，除西双版纳外，仅印度、缅甸、越南、马来亚一带有，数量也不多。
