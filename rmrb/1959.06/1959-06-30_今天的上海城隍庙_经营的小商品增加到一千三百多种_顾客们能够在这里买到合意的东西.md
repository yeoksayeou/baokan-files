Today's Shanghai City God Temple

The number of small commodities sold increases to more than 1,300 varieties

Customers can buy what they want here

Shanghai's famous small commodity market, the Old City God Temple, is actively developing handicraft production and vigorously organizing sources of goods, increasing the number of small commodities sold in the market to more than 1,300 varieties. Many customers with special needs and hobbies can buy what they want here. The market's retail turnover is also rising.

The Old City God Temple market has a history of more than 100 years. The small commodities here have always attracted customers with their rich variety, low prices, and good quality. Some of the market's shops and stalls are both workshops and stores, producing and selling their own products, while others have established production and sales relationships with many regions. However, the variety of commodities sold had decreased in the previous period, affecting the characteristics of the Old City God Temple's business. Relevant units in Shanghai have recently strengthened unified leadership over this market, investigated the small commodities historically sold in the temple, and taken various measures to help the market improve its business based on market needs. At the same time, they organized employees to discuss and deeply recognize the important position of small commodities in people's lives, overcoming the idea of some employees who were unwilling to engage in the business because small commodities are piecemeal, have low output value, and are troublesome to organize sources of goods.

The workshops attached to many stores in the market are now working hard to produce small commodities. The stores have arranged labor, in addition to transferring some skilled personnel to specialize in the production of small commodities, and many salespersons also help with production in their spare time. State-owned commercial departments supply a batch of raw materials. These workshops also leverage the characteristics of handicrafts to utilize waste products and scrap materials, using old cans, old bottle caps, and scrap angle iron to manufacture small cooking utensils, small hardware, and small toys; and using artificial bones and plastics from discarded mahjong tiles and chips to remake various types of seals and "bridge buckles" for women's clothing.

The Old City God Temple market actively restores old production and sales relationships and establishes new cooperative relationships, trying every possible means to open up sources of goods. Some adopt the method of processing with supplied materials, with production and sales parties cooperating in production. In addition, under the unified leadership of the competent departments, people are sent to other places to purchase small commodities. More than 90 kinds of small commodities have now been organized for production and purchased from other places.

The employees of the Old City God Temple market are further expanding production, increasing varieties and patterns, and supplying people with more abundant and diverse small commodities based on the sales characteristics of different seasons and the supply of raw materials. (Xinhua News Agency)

    今天的上海城隍庙
    经营的小商品增加到一千三百多种
    顾客们能够在这里买到合意的东西
    上海市著名的小商品市场——老城隍庙积极发展手工业生产，大力组织货源，使商场经营的小商品增加到一千三百多种。许多有特殊需要和爱好的顾客能在这里买到合意的东西。商场的零售营业额也随着上升。
    老城隍庙商场已有一百多年历史。这里的小商品一向以丰富多采、价廉物美吸引着顾客。商场的店、摊，有的亦工亦商、自产自销，有的与许多地区建立了产销关系。但是前一时期经营的商品品种有所减少，影响了老城隍庙经营的特色。上海市有关单位最近加强对这个商场的统一领导，调查了庙内历史上经营的小商品，根据市场的需要，采取各种办法帮助商场搞好经营。同时，组织职工讨论，使大家深刻认识到小商品在人民生活中占有重要的地位，克服了部分职工认为小商品零星、产值小、组织货源麻烦而不愿经营的思想。
    商场许多商店附设的作坊，现在正努力生产小商品。各商店安排了劳力，除了调出一部分有技术的人员专门生产小商品以外，还有很多营业员在空余时间帮助生产。国营商业部门供给一批原料材料。这些作坊也发挥了手工业利用废品废料的特点，用旧罐头、旧瓶盖、角铁下脚等制造出小炊具、小五金、小玩具等商品；用废旧麻将牌、筹码上的人造骨和塑胶，改制成各式各样的图章和妇女服装上用的“桥梁扣”。
    老城隍庙商场积极恢复老的产销关系，建立新的协作关系，千方百计开辟货源。有的采取发料加工的办法，产销双方协作生产。此外，还在主管部门的统一领导下，派人到外地采购小商品。现在已组织生产和从外地采购到的小商品九十多种。
    老城隍庙商场的职工正在根据不同季节的销货特点和原料供应情况，进一步扩大生产，增加花色品种，供应人们更加丰富多采的小商品。　（新华社）
