Review of "Analysis of China's National Economy During the Transition Period"
By Xu Dixin, published by Science Press
  　Yang Jianbai

The book "Analysis of China's National Economy During the Transition Period" by Comrade Xu Dixin was first published in 1957, and a revised edition was published recently in 1959. This time, the author has revised and supplemented it based on the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in production and the people's commune movement in our country in 1958. The book consists of fifteen chapters. The first five chapters comprehensively discuss the characteristics of China's economy during the transition period, the spirit and essence of the general line for the transition period and the general line for socialist construction, and the role of the basic socialist economic law and the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy in China's transition period. Chapters six to twelve analyze the development and changes of China's sectoral economy, national fiscal budget, and national income, respectively. Chapters thirteen to fifteen generally analyze the superiority of China's socialist system from the aspects of social reproduction, class relations, the relationship between productive forces and relations of production, and the relationship between the economic base and the superstructure.

One of the important characteristics of this book is that it better combines economic analysis with political analysis. As everyone knows, the economy is the foundation of politics, and politics is the concentrated expression of the economy. Therefore, when we study economic problems, we should not be separated from politics. From the perspective of China's actual situation, economic development is closely linked to political activities. For example, China's socialist transformation process and socialist construction process have been realized through nationwide mass movements under the guidance of the general line for the transition period and the general line for socialist construction. The socialist revolution on China's economic front has not only caused profound changes in the national economy, but also caused major changes in political and ideological aspects. The socialist revolution on the political and ideological front has not only greatly increased the socialist and communist spirit, and profound changes have taken place in the political atmosphere among the working people, but also a new situation of the Great Leap Forward has emerged in China's social and economic development. The author has firmly grasped this characteristic, observing and analyzing from both economic and political aspects, thus making this book have a clear reality and combat effectiveness.

Another important feature of this book is that it basically achieves the combination of theory and practice. The problem of theory must be combined with practice has long been solved in epistemology. However, in our real life, two tendencies often appear: one is that some people confuse theory with practice, for example, thinking that "practice is theory"; the other is that some people only talk about abstract concepts and do not combine with practice. Especially in the field of economic theory research, some people often forget to proceed from reality because they emphasize the use of abstract methods for research, and simply generalize the experiences in the real economy into theory. Judging from the content of this book, the author neither talks about economic theory abstractly, nor simply lists phenomena and narrates them plainly, but combines the Marxist-Leninist economic theory with our party's policies, lines, and the historical facts of China's economic development during the transition period for argumentation and analysis. In this way, the party's policies, lines, and actual economic problems are raised to the theoretical level, and the theory has vivid content.

There are many incisive discussions in this book. Here, only two examples are given for illustration.

First, when discussing the role of the basic socialist economic law, the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy, and the law of value in China's transition period, the author specifically analyzes under what conditions which law will play a role; and under what conditions which law will not play a role, based on the development and changes of China's economy during the transition period. I think this method of analysis is completely correct, and the conclusions drawn by the author from the analysis are generally correct. As we all know, objective laws cannot be created, transformed, or eliminated. The same is true for objective economic laws. As long as an economic law has the economic conditions on which it depends, it will inevitably play a role with a mandatory force. Conversely, if the economic conditions are not yet available or no longer exist, then it cannot play a role or will withdraw from the historical stage. Therefore, in my opinion, the practice of talking about the role of a certain law without proceeding from the actual situation is not worth following. Here, I would like to mention in passing that the author repeatedly mentions in the book that the role of a certain law is "restricted." I think this statement is not appropriate, because the role of the law cannot be "restricted." What the actual workers are saying is not a question of restriction or non-restriction, but a question of whether the economic conditions for a certain law to play a role exist or not. Of course, my view can also be further explored.

Second, the book's analysis of China's socialist transformation is quite profound, with a relatively high policy-oriented and theoretical level. It basically correctly reflects the great achievements of our party's creative application of Marxism-Leninism in this regard.

In summary, I think this book is indeed a good book. But on the other hand, there are also some issues that need to be discussed. Here, I will only briefly talk about it.

First, the issue of the system of this book. What kind of system should be adopted for works reflecting the economy during the transition period? This is a difficult problem to solve. The author has made efforts in this regard, but in my opinion, this problem has not been satisfactorily resolved.

Judging from the chapters of this book, the author discusses several economic laws, the party's general line for the transition period and the general line for socialist construction, as well as the characteristics and historical facts of China's economy during the transition period, in different chapters. However, in fact, these three aspects are interconnected and cannot be separated. For example, from the theoretical aspect, China's ownership forms and the three major transformations are the specific application of the law that the relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces; from the policy aspect, it is realized under the guidance of China's general line for the transition period. For another example, from the theoretical aspect, the planning of China's national economy is the specific application of the basic socialist economic law, the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy, and the theory of social reproduction; from the policy aspect, it is also realized under the guidance of the general line for the transition period and the general line for socialist construction. Separately discussing these problems that cannot be separated in fact, and talking about policies and facts when talking about theory, talking about facts and theory when talking about policies, and talking about theory and policies when talking about facts, will inevitably cause repetition, thus failing to bring the theoretical level of this book to the appropriate height.

It can be seen from the preface of this book that the author attempts to observe the changes of China's national economy from the perspective of China's social industrialization and socialist transformation. Therefore, I am imagining (just imagining) that if the author takes China's general line for the transition period and the general line for socialist construction as the outline, and China's three major transformation undertakings and various sectors of the national economy as the detailed items to carry out the discussion, and theoretically discusses the party's line, policies, and the characteristics of China's economic development, it may be possible to better combine theory with practice and make the book more theoretical. If another approach is adopted, such as taking the law that the relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces, the basic socialist economic law, the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy, and the theory of social reproduction as the outline to discuss our party's general line for the transition period, the general line for socialist construction, and the national economic development, it may be better than the system of this book. These opinions are very immature and may not be appropriate, and are only for the author's reference.

Second, the issue of the exposition of the general line for socialist construction, just as the author correctly pointed out, "The proposal of the general line for socialist construction is a matter of great historical significance after the party's general line for the transition period." However, in this book, the author only uses a short space in the third section of the second chapter to expound on such a matter of great historical significance, and in my opinion, it is not profound enough and not comprehensive enough.

In this section, the author points out a very important issue, that is: "The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong did not deal with the problem of developing China's social productive forces in isolation as a technical problem, but clearly dealt with it as a political problem of mobilizing the masses and giving full play to the enthusiasm and potential power of the masses, and dialectically dealt with it in connection with correctly handling the relations of production and the superstructure." It is of course completely correct to deal with the issue of productive forces in this way. However, if the importance of the development of productive forces and the technical revolution is neglected due to the emphasis on political role and mass movement, then it is not in line with the original intention of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. As we all know, the fundamental purpose of the socialist revolution is to develop productive forces and improve people's living standards. The reason why our socialist system can finally defeat the capitalist system is, in the final analysis, that our labor productivity is much higher than that of capitalism. And from the perspective of future development, the reason why the future communist society has a faster production speed than the socialist society is, in the final analysis, that labor productivity is constantly improving. The key to improving labor productivity is to carry out the technical revolution movement, that is, to rely on putting politics in command and carry out the mass movement centered on the technical revolution. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report at the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "In view of the situation that the socialist revolution on the economic front, the political front, and the ideological front has basically achieved victory, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong believe that it is now the time to put forward new revolutionary tasks to the whole party and the people of the whole country, and it is the time to put forward the technical revolution and the cultural revolution that complements the technical revolution." Comrade Liu Shaoqi made a detailed discussion of the main tasks of the technical revolution in the same report. However, it is regrettable that this book does not give due attention to this aspect.

Third, the issue of the contradiction between socialist relations of production and productive forces. We are dialectical materialists. We affirmatively acknowledge that there is a contradiction between socialist relations of production and productive forces. However, we must distinguish between what is the contradiction between socialist relations of production and productive forces, and what is the contradiction between non-socialist relations of production and productive forces during the transition period.

According to personal superficial understanding, for example, due to the development of productive forces, the collective ownership of the means of production and the collective ownership of products of agricultural production cooperatives require a gradual transition to the collective ownership of people's communes; due to the Great Leap Forward in some production sectors, certain forms of wages need to be reformed as necessary, and so on, which belong to the contradiction between socialist relations of production and productive forces. As for the fact that capitalists are still receiving fixed interest and thus have contradictions with the development of productive forces, the bureaucracy of leaders and managers has contradictions with the development of productive forces, etc., which are all contradictions between non-socialist relations of production and productive forces during the transition period. In this book, the author, on the one hand, points out that fixed interest is a remnant of capitalist relations of production, and the bureaucratic style and its ideology are products of feudalism and capitalism, but on the other hand, summarizes these as "the contradiction between socialist relations of production and productive forces." Obviously, this is not rigorous enough in terms of logic.

    评“中国过渡时期国民经济的分析”
    许涤新著  科学出版社出版
  　杨坚白
    许涤新同志著的“中国过渡时期国民经济的分析”一书，初版于1957年，不久以前又出版了1959年修订本。这一次，作者根据我国1958年的生产大跃进和人民公社化运动的新情况，又进行了修订和补充。全书共十五章。前五章综合地论述了我国过渡时期经济的特点，过渡时期总路线和社会主义建设总路线的精神和实质，以及社会主义基本经济规律和国民经济有计划（按比例）发展规律在我国过渡时期的作用。第六至十二章，分别地分析了我国的部门经济、国家财政预算和国民收入的发展变化。第十三至十五章，又从社会再生产、阶级关系，以及生产力同生产关系的关系，以及经济基础同上层建筑的关系等方面，概括地分析了我国社会主义制度的优越性。
    这本书的重要特色之一是把经济分析同政治分析较好地结合起来。谁都知道，经济是政治的基础，而政治又是经济的集中表现。因此，当我们研究经济问题时，我们就不应该离开政治。从我国的实际情况来看，经济的发展无一不是跟政治活动紧密结合的。例如，我国的社会主义改造过程和社会主义建设过程，都是在过渡时期总路线和社会主义建设总路线的指导下，通过全民性的群众运动而实现的。我国在经济战线上的社会主义革命不只是引起了国民经济的深刻变化，同时也引起了政治思想方面的重大变革。而政治思想战线上的社会主义革命不只是社会主义和共产主义的正气大大上升，在劳动人民中间的政治空气发生了深刻的变化，同时我国的社会经济发展也出现了大跃进的新局面。作者正是紧紧地抓住了这个特点，既从经济方面进行观察和分析，也从政治方面进行观察和分析，因而使这本书具有了鲜明的现实性和战斗性。
    这本书另一个重要的特色是基本上做到了理论同实际相结合。理论必须结合实际的问题，这在认识论上是早已解决了的。但是，在我们的现实生活中却常常出现两种倾向：一种是有的人把理论同实际混为一谈，例如认为“实践就是理论”；一种是有的人只谈抽象的概念，不结合实际，尤其是在经济理论研究方面，常常有人由于强调采取抽象法进行研究，而忘记了从实际出发，把现实经济中的经验综合上升为理论。从这本书的内容看来，作者既不是抽象地来谈论经济理论，也不是简单地罗列现象，平铺直叙，而是把马克思列宁主义的经济理论跟我党的政策、路线和我国过渡时期经济发展的史实结合起来加以论证分析。这样，就把党的政策、路线和实际经济问题提高到理论上去，而理论也就具有了生动的内容。
    在这本书中有许多精辟的论述。在这里，只举两个例子加以说明。
    第一、作者在论述社会主义基本经济规律、国民经济有计划（按比例）发展规律和价值规律在我国过渡时期的作用时，都是从我国过渡时期经济的发展变化过程中，具体地分析了在什么样的条件下，什么规律就起作用；在什么样的条件下，什么规律就不起作用。我认为这种分析方法是完全正确的，作者从分析中所得出的结论，一般说来，也是正确的。如所周知，客观规律是不能创造、不能改造、不能消灭的。客观的经济规律也是一样。只要某一经济规律具有它赖以存在的经济条件，它就必然以一种强制性的力量发生作用。反之，如果经济条件还不具备或者不复存在，那它就不能发生作用或者是退出历史舞台。因此，那种不从实际情况出发、空谈某某规律的作用的做法，在我看来，是不足为训的。在这里顺便提一笔，作者在书中一再谈到某某规律的作用受到“限制”，我认为这种说法不够妥当，因为规律的作用是不能“限制”的。实际工作者所说的并不是限制不限制的问题，而是某一规律发生作用的经济条件存在不存在的问题。当然，我的这个看法也是可以作进一步探讨的。
    第二、这本书对于我国社会主义改造的分析是相当深刻的，政策性和理论性都比较高，它基本正确地反映了我党在这方面创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的伟大成就。
    综上所述，我认为这本书确是一本好书。但是另一方面，它也还存在着一些需要商榷的问题。在这里，也只扼要地谈一谈。
    第一、关于这本书的体系问题。关于反映过渡时期经济的著作，究竟采取什么样的体系才好呢？这是一个很难解决的问题。作者曾经为此作过努力，但是据我看来，这个问题还没有得到令人满意的解决。
    从这本书的章节上看，作者是把几个经济规律、党的过渡时期总路线和社会主义建设总路线，以及我国过渡时期经济的特点和史实，分别在不同章节中论述的。可是，事实上这三个方面是互相联系，不能分开的。例如，我国过渡时期的所有制形式和三大改造，从理论方面来说，它是生产关系要适合生产力性质规律的具体运用；从政策方面来说，它是在我国过渡时期总路线的指导下实现的。又例如，我国的国民经济计划化，从理论方面来说，它是社会主义基本经济规律，国民经济有计划（按比例）发展规律和社会再生产理论的具体运用；从政策方面来说，它也是在过渡时期总路线和社会主义建设总路线的指导下实现的。把这些事实上无法分开的问题分别进行论述，而在讲理论的时候要讲政策和事实，讲政策的时候，要讲事实和理论，讲事实的时候又要讲理论和政策，这样就不免造成重复，从而使本书的理论水平未能达到应有高度。
    从这本书的序言中看出，作者是企图从我国的社会工业化和社会主义改造事业的角度来观察我国国民经济的变化的。因此，我在设想（仅仅是设想），作者如果是以我国的过渡时期总路线和社会主义建设总路线为纲、以我国的三大改造事业和国民经济各部门为目展开论述，并且把党的路线政策和我国经济发展的特点从理论上加以论述，就有可能使理论同实际结合得更好，使本书的理论性更高。如果是采取另一种方式，例如以生产关系要适合生产力性质的规律、社会主义基本经济规律、国民经济有计划（按比例）发展规律和社会再生产理论为纲，来论述我党的过渡时期总路线、社会主义建设总路线和国民经济发展，也可能比本书的体系要好些。这些意见很不成熟，不一定妥当，仅供作者参考而已。
    第二、关于社会主义建设总路线的阐述问题，正像作者所正确指出的，“社会主义建设总路线的提出，是党在过渡时期总路线以后的具有重大历史意义的事情。”但是，作者在这本书中对于这样一件具有重大历史意义的事情，仅仅在第二章第三节中用不长的篇幅来阐述它，而且在我看来，还阐述得不够深刻，不够全面。
    作者在这一节中指出了一个非常重要的问题，这就是：“党中央和毛泽东同志对于发展我国社会生产力的问题，不是孤立地作为一个技术问题去处理，而是明确地作为一个发动群众，发挥群众的积极性和潜在力量的政治问题去处理，而是辩证地把它同正确地处理生产关系和上层建筑的问题联系在一道来处理的。”这样地来处理生产力问题当然是完全正确的。但是，如果因为强调政治作用和群众运动而忽视了生产力的发展和技术革命的重要意义，那就跟党中央和毛泽东同志的原意不相符了。如所周知，社会主义革命的根本目的在于发展生产力和提高人民生活水平，我们的社会主义制度之所以能够最后战胜资本主义制度，归根结底，在于我们的劳动生产率要比资本主义高得多。而且从发展前途来看，未来的共产主义社会之所以比社会主义社会生产速度更快，归根结底，也在于劳动生产率的不断提高。而提高劳动生产率的关键就是开展技术革命运动，也就是依靠政治挂帅，开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动。刘少奇同志在八大二次会议上的报告中指出：“鉴于经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命已经基本上获得胜利的情况，党中央和毛泽东同志认为，现在已经是向全党和全国人民提出新的革命任务的时候了，已经是提出技术革命以及同技术革命相辅而行的文化革命的时候了。”刘少奇同志在同一报告中对于技术革命的主要任务作了详细的论述。但是，令人遗憾的是这本书并没有在这一方面给以应有的重视。
    第三、关于社会主义生产关系同生产力间的矛盾问题。我们是辩证唯物主义者。我们肯定地承认社会主义生产关系同生产力之间是存在着矛盾的。但是，我们必须把什么是社会主义的生产关系同生产力的矛盾，什么是过渡时期的非社会主义的生产关系同生产力的矛盾区别开来。
    根据个人的粗浅认识，例如农业生产合作社的生产资料集体所有制和产品集体所有制，由于生产力的发展，要求逐步过渡到人民公社的集体所有制；某些生产部门由于生产大跃进，某些工资的形式需要进行必要的改革，等等，是属于社会主义的生产关系同生产力之间的矛盾的。至于资本家还在拿定息因而同生产力发展有矛盾，领导者和管理人员的官气同生产力发展有矛盾，等等，都是过渡时期的非社会主义的生产关系同生产力的矛盾。作者在这本书中，一方面指出定息是资本主义生产关系残余，官僚主义作风及其意识形态来说乃是封建主义和资本主义的产物，另一方面又把这些概括为“社会主义生产关系和生产力间的矛盾”。显然这在逻辑性上是不够严密的。
