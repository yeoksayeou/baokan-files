Skilled Resin-Tapping Hand – Wang Yongjin
By our reporter Zhong Nianzu

Crowds of people surrounded the pine forest, watching the resin-tapping experts perform. On the east side of the forest, a resin-tapping worker, around thirty years old and of average height, wielded his tapping knife, skillfully making two or three strokes on the tapping surface of the pine tree trunk. In an instant, he appeared beside the second, third, and more pine trees. He ran very fast, darting through the forest like a rabbit, but he didn't miss a single tree. Someone calculated the time he took to tap a single tree, and it never exceeded twenty seconds. Looking at the bark scraped open on the trunk, only 70% was cut, the cut was so smooth, neither deep nor wide, and the angle of the side grooves was about sixty to seventy degrees. The resin flowed normally along the central groove, through the resin guide, and into the resin container. The onlookers exclaimed in admiration, "His movements are so skillful!" The person being praised was Wang Yongjin, the creator of the record of tapping ten thousand catties of resin in five months.

Wang Yongjin is a member of the Shangping Commune in Longchuan County, Guangdong Province, and a representative attending the National Experience Exchange Conference on Pine Resin, Rosin, and Tannin Production. Last year, in a situation where the pine forest was sparse and most of the pine trees had been tapped for many years, he created a record of tapping one thousand one hundred and twenty trees a day, and collecting ten thousand five hundred catties of resin in just over five months. According to statistics from the resin purchasing station, 80% of the resin Wang Yongjin delivered to the purchasing station was of the highest grade. Calculated based on the size of the pine trees, the density of the pine forest, the extent of tapping on the pine trees, the length of working hours, and the number of trees tapped, this is a remarkable achievement. Currently, there is no one who can match him.

New Method of Unknown Origin

That was the second year Wang Yongjin was engaged in resin-tapping. Liu Yatai, a resin-tapping worker living in their village, returned to his hometown in Heyuan County in April or May. He saw that some people in his village were using a completely different method of resin-tapping than the one he had used for years, tapping from top to bottom instead of from bottom to top. He thought this method was quite novel, and after returning to Xiaohui Village, he selected thirty trees for testing. A month later, he collected nearly three hundred catties of resin, an increase of more than 40% compared to the old method. Liu Yatai and Wang Yongjin were very close, and he told Wang Yongjin about this. Wang Yongjin thought that since this method could increase production, it might be worth trying. He used this new method on one hundred of the four hundred pine trees he was tapping, and the yield was indeed higher than before.

Wang Yongjin's use of the "descending method" of resin-tapping quickly became the center of discussion among the resin-tapping workers in the village. Some said they wanted to learn Wang Yongjin's method; others said they couldn't learn it, saying that his method would cause the resin to leak. When the news reached Wang Yongjin, it inspired him: indeed, some resin was leaking before it reached the resin container. He thought: the problem was probably not that the "descending method" was bad, but that the angle of the side grooves was too large, causing the resin to flow too quickly. So he reduced the angle of the side grooves to about twenty degrees, but it didn't work, the resin started to flow very slowly, and then it solidified in the groove. Wang Yongjin was not discouraged, he tried again and again, and finally made the side grooves at an angle of sixty to seventy degrees, the resin flowed normally, and there was no resin leakage. A month later, he compared the yields of the two tapping methods. The one hundred pine trees tapped with the "descending method" yielded one thousand catties of resin, while the three hundred trees tapped with the old method yielded two thousand catties. The yield of the descending method was more than 40% higher than that of the old method. After that, except for some trees that had been tapped for many years and the tapping opening was already three meters above the ground, which could only be tapped with the "ascending method," all the other trees he tapped were tapped with the "descending method." Seeing the benefits of the new method, the resin-tapping workers in the village also adopted it one after another. Not long ago, people learned that this "descending method" of resin-tapping was an advanced experience that had been introduced from the Soviet Union.

"Thanks to Township Head Peng"

In 1956, Wang Yongjin's resin-tapping skills gradually became proficient, and he tapped six hundred pine trees a day, with an annual resin yield of more than six thousand catties. This was already remarkable at the time. Wang Yongjin himself felt somewhat satisfied. Peng Kuishi, the township head of Shangping at the time, always felt that something was not quite right. He publicized to Wang Yongjin the significance of increasing pine resin production for supporting the country's economic construction and improving people's lives, helped him solve difficulties in his life, and encouraged him to continue to move forward. After talking with Township Head Peng, Wang Yongjin felt ashamed and shouldn't be complacent and slacken his efforts just because he had achieved a little success. After that, he often studied how to increase pine resin production. He found that he was only relying on enthusiasm and hadn't paid attention to shortening the time spent running around, which was an obstacle to tapping more trees and increasing production. He constantly explored in his work, selecting the shortest routes that could minimize or avoid climbing steep slopes based on the distribution of the pine trees and the terrain, and clearing small trees and weeds from the tapping paths to shorten walking time and reduce fatigue from climbing mountains. In this way, the number of trees tapped also increased.

Although Wang Yongjin was not very old, he felt that his right arm was very tired every time he came back from tapping resin. He thought that if his left hand could also tap resin, he wouldn't be so tired. He was determined to let his left hand also master the technique. At first, the efficiency was very low, which prolonged the resin-tapping time, and he couldn't get down the mountain until very late every day. But the difficulties couldn't shake his will, and he believed that his left hand could also achieve the efficiency of his right hand. In this way, day after day, month after month, his left hand gradually became proficient in tapping resin, and he could use both hands freely, and he no longer felt tired.

In the past, Wang Yongjin, like other resin-tapping workers, removed the thin bark, and the width of the side grooves was very wide. This required a lot of effort and the speed was slow. He thought that if the bark was removed thicker and the width of the side grooves was made narrower, it would save effort when tapping resin. At the same time, because the remaining bark would be thinner, it would be exposed to more sunlight, the temperature would rise, and more resin would flow. By doing this, the resin-tapping efficiency was more than four times higher than before, and resin secretion also increased. Wang Yongjin also reformed the resin-tapping tools according to the height of the tapping opening, making the tapping knife and hook knife into one tool. The hook was used for low openings, and the shovel was used for high openings, and the efficiency was also improved.

This year, thanks to a series of technological innovations, Wang Yongjin increased the number of pine trees tapped per day from six hundred to nine hundred, and the annual output increased from more than six thousand catties to more than eight thousand catties. When people talked to him about this year's progress, he said modestly, "Thanks to Township Head Peng."

Unprecedented

Last year, because of other matters, Wang Yongjin didn't go up the mountain to tap resin until mid-April; later, he went down the mountain again because of work needs. It seemed that it would be difficult for the resin production in 1958 to keep up with 1957. Thinking of this, he felt a little pessimistic. However, the situation of the Great Leap Forward was spurring him on. He thought: All sectors are making a great leap forward, can't pine resin production also make a great leap forward? Moreover, rosin and turpentine are indispensable raw materials for light and heavy industries. "This year's output must not be less than 1957." Wang Yongjin secretly made this decision.

For many years, in Wang Yongjin's hometown, the resin containers used for tapping resin were made of small bamboo tubes, and both old and new bamboo were used. This kind of resin container can generally only hold about one catty, and because the resin container is small, the resin has to be collected every day or every two or three days. If the time interval for collecting resin is too long for some tender bamboo tubes, the resin inside will deteriorate; at the same time, because the resin container does not have a lid, the resin is often washed away by rainwater during rainy days. In peacetime, some debris on the pine trees often falls into the resin container, affecting the quality of the resin. In the past, Wang Yongjin had the idea of replacing small bamboo tubes with large bamboo tubes to reduce the number of resin collections and save labor. But he was afraid that the resin would deteriorate if the time interval for collecting resin was too long. This idea was shelved. In order to increase production, he thought of this matter again. He first did an experiment, and the effect was very good. Resin was collected once every half a month, and the resin would not deteriorate. Soon, he came up with the idea of adding a lid and using only old bamboo to make resin containers. This not only ensured that there were fewer impurities in the resin, but also prevented rainwater from entering the bamboo tube. The number of resin collections was reduced, which increased the resin-tapping time.

In the forest area where Wang Yongjin is located, there are some pine trees that are bent over and deformed. Resin-tapping work on such pine trees is difficult to do, and it is difficult to place resin containers, and the resin often flows to the ground. Therefore, many resin-tapping workers in the commune are unwilling to tap resin on these pine trees. In order to tap more trees and strive to increase pine resin production, Wang Yongjin set his sights on these pine trees. According to the characteristics of these tapped trees, he made another resin guide that was much shorter than the average resin guide, and dug a small hole not far from the end of the central groove, so that the resin would first flow there, and then flow into the resin container through the resin guide. In this way, the resin would not leak out due to flowing too quickly. For those old trees that were tapped with the ascending method by people from Heyuan County before liberation, Wang Yongjin used the "cicada molting" method (that is, the ascending method is used in peacetime, and the descending method is used when the temperature is low) to increase production, so that the output would not be reduced too much due to weather changes under low temperature conditions.

    巧刈松脂手——王永金
    本报记者　钟念祖
    松林的四周，尽是些观看采脂能手表演的人群。在林子里的东边，一位三十岁上下个子不算高大的采脂手，挥动着刈刀，轻巧地在杵干的刈面处划了两三下。转瞬间，他又在第二第三和更多的杵身旁边出现了。他跑得很快，像一个兔子似的在林子里钻，可是刈的杵却一株也不漏。有人曾给他算过刈一株杵的时间，最多的不超过二十秒。看那杵干上刮开的粗皮，只刈开70％，刈口是那样平滑，不深又不宽，侧沟的夹角约在六十度到七十度之间，松脂正常地沿着中沟，经过导脂器流进盛脂器里。观看表演的人们赞叹地说：“动作真轻巧！”被称赞的人就是采脂五个月得脂万斤的创造者——王永金。
    王永金是广东省龙川县上坪公社的社员，参加全国松脂、松香、栲胶生产经验交流会议的代表。去年，他在松林较稀、大部分松杵已开刈多年的情况下，创造了日刈一千一百二十株杵，采脂五个多月得脂一万零五百斤的纪录。据松脂收购站的统计，在王永金交到收购站的这些松脂中，特级脂占了80％。按松杵的大小、松林的稀密、松杵开刈和劳动时间的长短、刈杵的数量等为标准计算，这是个了不起的成就。在目前，还没有能够和他媲美的人。
    不明来历的新法
    那是王永金从事采脂工作的第二年。住在他们村里的采脂手刘亚泰在4、5月间回到他家乡——河源县一趟。他看到乡里有些人采脂的方法和他历年来的方法完全两样，从上逐渐往下刈，而不是从下逐渐往上刈。他觉得这方法倒也新鲜，回到小灰村以后，他选了三十株杵作试验。一个月以后，收到了松脂近三百斤，比老方法增产了40％多。刘亚泰和王永金很要好，他把这事告诉了王永金。王永金觉得这方法既然能提高产量，便不妨多试。他在自己采脂的四百株松杵中，以一百株松杵采用这种新方法，产量果然比原来高。
    王永金采用“下降法”的采脂方法，很快便成了村里采脂手的议论中心。有的说要学习王永金的方法；有的说不能学，说他这做法会跑掉松脂。消息传到王永金那里，对他可是个启发：的确有些松脂还没到盛脂器便跑掉了。他想：问题恐怕不在“下降法”不好，而在于侧沟角度太大，松脂流得过急所致。于是他把侧沟的角度缩小，约二十来度，可是不成，松脂开始流得很慢，后来又凝结在沟里。王永金并没有气馁，他一试再试，最后把侧沟开成六十到七十度角，松脂流得正常，也没有跑脂的现象了。一个月以后，他对比了一下两种采脂法的产量，“下降法”采脂的那一百株松杵，收到松脂一千斤，土法采脂的那三百株杵，收到二千斤，下降法比土法产量高出40％多。这以后，他所采脂的松杵，除了部分因开刈多年、刈口离地面已高达三公尺，只能用“上升法”采脂外，其余全是“下降法”采刈。村里的采脂手看到新法的好处，也纷纷采用。不久以前，人们才知道这个“下降法”采脂是从苏联传来的先进经验。
    “多亏了彭乡长”
    1956年，王永金的采脂技术逐步熟练了，日刈松杵达到六百株，年采脂量达到六千多斤。这在当时已经是了不起了。在王永金自己也感到有些满足。当时的上坪乡长彭奎石总觉得有点不对劲。他向王永金宣传提高松脂产量对支援国家经济建设和改善人民生活的意义，帮助他解决生活上的困难，鼓励他继续前进。和彭乡长谈话以后，王永金感到惭愧，不应该稍有点成绩便自满松劲。这以后，他便经常研究如何提高松脂产量的问题。他发现自己光凭干劲，没有注意缩短跑路的时间，这是争取多刈杵提高产量的障碍。他在工作中不断摸索，根据松杵的分布及山势情况，选择最短而又可以少走和不走过陡的山坡的路线，并且斩除采道的小杵和杂草，以缩短走路时间和减少爬山的疲劳。这样，刈杵的数量也就跟着增加了。
    尽管王永金的年纪还不算大，但每当他刈脂回来后便感到右臂很累。他想，如果左手也能刈脂，就不致那样累了。他决心让左手也掌握技术。开始，效率很低，因而延长了采脂的时间，每天，他很晚才能下山。但困难没有能够动摇他的意志，他相信左手同样能够达到右手的效率。这样，一天两天一个月两个月，左手刈脂渐渐熟练了，左右手运用自如，他再也不感到劳累了。
    过去，王永金和其他采脂手一样，砍除粗皮较薄，侧沟宽度刈得很宽，这样做用力要大，速度慢。他想，如果把粗皮砍除厚一些，侧沟宽度刈得窄一些，刈脂时便省力，同时由于剩下来的粗皮薄了，受阳光便会较多，温度提高，松脂也会流得多一些。这样做，刈脂效率比前提高了四倍多，松脂分泌也跟着增加了。王永金还根据刈口的高低，改革采脂工具，将刈刀和钩刀制成一件工具，低的用钩，高的用铲，效率也获得了提高。
    这一年，王永金由于进行了一系列的技术革新，日刈松杵从六百株提高到九百株，年产量从六千多斤增加到八千多斤。当人们和他谈起这一年的进步时，他谦逊地说：“多亏了彭乡长。”
    有空前无绝后
    去年因为别的事，王永金到4月中旬才上山采脂；后来，又因工作需要，再度下山，看来1958年松脂的产量很难跟得上1957年了。想到这，他感到有点悲观。然而大跃进的形势在鞭策着他。他想：各行各业都在大跃进，难道松脂生产就不能跃进吗？何况，松香和松节油又是轻重工业不可缺少的原料。“今年的产量一定不能少于1957年。”王永金暗自下了这样的决心。
    多年来，在王永金的家乡里，采脂用的盛脂器都用小竹筒做的，且不拘老竹嫩竹。这种盛脂器，一般只能装一斤左右，因为盛脂器小，就得每天或隔两三天收一次脂。有些嫩竹筒，如果收脂的时间相隔长了些，里面的松脂就会变质；同时由于盛脂器没有上盖，下雨期间松脂往往会给雨水冲跑。在平时，有些杵上的杂物也常掉进盛脂器里，影响松脂质量。过去王永金曾经有过改用大竹筒代替小竹筒的想法，以减少收脂的次数来节省劳动力。但又怕收脂的时间相隔长了，松脂变质。这个想法也就搁了下来。为了要提高产量，他又想起这件事情。他先做了试验，效果很好，半个月收脂一次，松脂也不会变质。不久，他又想出了加盖和全部采用老竹做盛脂器的办法。这样，既保证了松脂杂质少，又使雨水不能进入竹筒。收脂的次数减少了，就增加了刈脂的时间。
    在王永金所在的林区，有一部分弯腰曲背畸形发展松杵。这样松杵刈脂工作既难做，又不好安放盛脂器，松脂常常流到地面上。因此，社里的许多采脂手都不愿在这些松杵上刈脂。为了多刈一些杵，争取多增加松脂产量，王永金看上了这些松杵，他根据这些刈的特点，另制了一种比一般导脂器短得多的导脂器，并在距中沟末端不远的地方挖一小窿，让松脂先流到那里，然后再经过导脂器流进盛脂器。这样，松脂便不会因流得过急而泄在外面。对那些解放前便由河源县人用上升法采脂的老杵，王永金运用了“秋蝉退壳”的方法（即平时用上升法，气温低时用下降法）来提高产量，使在气温低的情况下，产量不致因天气变化而降低过多。
