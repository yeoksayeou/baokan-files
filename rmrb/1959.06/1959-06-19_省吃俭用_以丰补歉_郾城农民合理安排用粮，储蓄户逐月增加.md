Save Carefully, Supplement Scarcity with Abundance
    Yancheng Farmers Ration Food Rationally, Number of Savings Accounts Increases Monthly

    (Our newspaper Yancheng, June 18th dispatch) No matter which rural canteen you visit in Yancheng County, Henan, you'll see a wide variety of meals with various vegetables mixed in. Some commune canteens are even still able to serve fresh potatoes stored from last year.

    Before the wheat harvest, Party committees at all levels in Yancheng County, in accordance with the spirit of eating our fill, eating well, and saving, launched a widespread discussion among the masses on food consumption plans. During the discussion, based on the experience of preventing lean years in good years, the masses put forward many good methods for saving. Many production teams also revised their plans for using grain and planting vegetables. Some time ago, the county's canteens utilized about 20,000 mu of vacant land to plant vegetables, which are now being used in large quantities for cooking. Vegetable noodles, vegetable steamed buns, and vegetable dumplings have become popular foods. The Spring Village Brigade canteen in the Xindian Commune has particularly good food arrangements. In the recent seven days, the members ate three meals of garlic noodles, six meals of steamed buns, four meals of vegetable dumplings, and eight meals of soup noodles, five of which also included sweet potato porridge. This brigade still has more than 40,000 jin of fresh potatoes, grain, and dried vegetables stored from last year.

    The number of bank deposit accounts is higher than before, with more than half of the farm households in many communes having savings accounts. The total amount of deposits by the people of the county has increased fourfold compared with the same period last year. In previous years, bank savings deposits tended to be more withdrawals than deposits in the spring, but this year it is the opposite, with deposits increasing monthly. Xu Daxue, a 53-year-old woman from the Daliu Commune, has been making use of her spare time to make seven pairs of cloth shoes and eighty-three straw hats since this spring, and has deposited all the money she earned into the bank.

    The thrifty atmosphere is also growing day by day in the rural market. Although the expenses of the masses for purchasing consumer goods have increased compared to the past, the expenses for purchasing means of production have increased even more. Comparing the market sales in the first five months of this year with the same period last year, the means of production have increased by 363%. Cherries and apricots, which used to be eaten casually, are now being sold as much as possible. The farmers are also collecting many waste products to sell to the state. For example, waste wood and hemp rope ends, which people rarely paid attention to in the past, are now being collected and sold to the state.

    Due to their thrifty lifestyle, the farmers in this county have saved a large amount of funds to invest in production. According to statistics from relevant departments, the purchase of means of production in the first five months of this year compared with the same period last year: pesticides increased by 3%, small farm tools increased by 22%, coal increased by more than two times, and rubber-wheeled carts and rickshaws have more than doubled.

    省吃俭用　以丰补歉
    郾城农民合理安排用粮，储蓄户逐月增加
    本报郾城18日电　无论走到河南郾城县的哪个农村食堂，都能看到掺有各种菜蔬的花样繁多的饭菜，有些公社的食堂到现在还能吃上去年储存的鲜薯。
    小麦收割之前，郾城县各级党委按照吃饱、吃好、节省的精神，曾发动群众广泛讨论了用粮计划。讨论中，群众根据丰年防歉年的经验，提出了许多节约的好办法，许多生产队还修订了用粮种菜的计划。前些时，全县食堂利用空地播种的两万亩左右的蔬菜，现在已经大量上灶作菜了，菜面条、菜馍、菜包子成了人们喜爱的食品。新店公社春庄大队食堂的伙食安排得特别好，在最近的七天中，社员们吃到了三顿蒜面条、六顿馍头、四顿菜包、八顿汤面，其中有五顿还喝到了红薯稀饭。这个大队现在还存有去年的鲜薯、粮食和干菜四万多斤。
    银行存款户比以往多了，许多公社一半以上的农户存了款。全县人民的存款总额比去年同期增加了四倍。往年春季，银行储蓄存款往往支多存少，今年却相反，存款逐月有增加。大刘公社五十三岁的徐大雪老大娘，从今年春季到现在，抽空做了七双布鞋、八十三顶草帽，卖的钱全部存入了银行。
    在农村市场上，也可以看出俭朴的风气一天天在增长，虽然群众用于购买生活资料的费用比过去增加了，但是，用于购买生产资料的费用却增加得更多。拿今年头五个月市场销售额和去年同期比较，生产资料增加了363％。过去随便吃掉的樱桃和杏子，今年也尽量争取外销。农民们还搜集许多废品卖给国家。例如人们过去很少理睬的废木料、麻绳头，都搜集起来出售给国家。
    由于生活俭朴，这个县的农民们已经节约出了大批资金投入生产。据有关部门统计，今年头五个月购买的生产资料和去年同期比较：农药增加3％、小农具增加22％、煤炭增加了两倍多，胶轮车、人力车都增加了一倍以上。
