    Western Disagreements Widen at Foreign Ministers Meeting
    U.S. Struggles to Maintain Control; "Common Front" Difficult to Sustain
    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 8th (by our correspondent Wan Guang) – For over four weeks at the Geneva Foreign Ministers Meeting, Western countries have effectively been conducting two sets of talks simultaneously. One, of course, is the meeting between the foreign ministers of Eastern and Western countries, and the other is the constant behind-the-scenes consultation within the "Western front."
    Every day, Western foreign ministers, or their assistants and experts, hold such consultations, to formulate or reformulate their "common strategy," sometimes once, sometimes several times. For example, on May 30th, immediately after the Eastern and Western foreign ministers concluded their meeting at a little after 5 p.m., the foreign ministers of the three Western powers immediately met with West German Foreign Minister Brentano to discuss how the West would act in the informal talks held at Gromyko's dinner at 8 p.m. that evening. The degree of tension is evident.
    Relying on such behind-the-scenes consultations, Western countries have so far managed to maintain a "common front" at the Eastern and Western foreign ministers' meeting, repeatedly rejecting the Soviet proposals on concluding a German peace treaty and ending the occupation of West Berlin.
    The Western countries are united in opposing the conclusion of a German peace treaty, keeping West Germany in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, deepening the division of Germany, and attempting to keep their occupying forces in West Berlin. However, with Soviet peace initiatives deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the West cannot simply say "no" and must come up with some "proposals" to cope with and evade. That's where the problem lies. Moreover, within the Western countries, there is no shortage of those who want to take advantage of the current situation to gain the upper hand in the fierce conflict of interests within the West. As U.S. columnist Lippmann said, one of the reasons why the Geneva talks are "very difficult" for the West is that "the Western allies have not yet reached full agreement on what they are uniformly willing to accept."
    During the Geneva conference, it seems that a "rule" to maintain "Atlantic order" has been established within the "Western front": only topics and plans on which the four Western powers have reached a "common opinion" are allowed to be put forward at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting; in all areas where there is no "common opinion," no one is allowed to "act alone," to put forward proposals at the conference table, or to discuss them in formal occasions.
    A scene displaying this "order" appeared at the plenary session of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting on June 5th. At that time, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko asked the Western countries to clarify their attitude towards the two issues of renouncing the use of force in international disputes and establishing a limited armaments zone in Europe, while U.S. Secretary of State Herter completely evaded the question in his "answer," and the other Western foreign ministers remained silent. The next day, the "New York Herald Tribune" pointed out the reason: Gromyko "touched one of the West's greatest weaknesses." A limited armaments zone and mutual non-aggression were originally concepts of interest to the British government. Although under pressure from its allies, Britain has not dared to formally raise them again at the current meeting, the reality that prompted Britain to consider these concepts still exists. Therefore, when Gromyko suddenly mentioned these issues, the Western countries not only had no "common opinion," but also did not even have the opportunity to go into another secret room to consult on how to answer, and had to show their embarrassment.
    In the past week, an "inside story" has been widely circulating in the "House of Journalists" here: Lloyd stated in a private conversation with Western journalists that Britain had some proposals on the West Berlin issue that had not yet been put forward, and Herter then reiterated the "rule" of the "Atlantic order" to Lloyd. As a result, Lloyd stated again at the public meeting the next day that he "agreed with what Herter said."
    The kind of pattern shown by this "inside story" has actually appeared repeatedly during the Geneva conference.
    In addition to Herter's "rule" of the "Atlantic order," there is also a "whispering campaign" prevalent in the places where Western delegation personnel gather and in the circle of Western journalists in the "House of Journalists." The main target of this movement is also aimed at Britain. West German and French officials and journalists, as well as American journalists, are active participants in this "whispering campaign," and the U.S. officialdom is adding fuel to the fire. In these "whispers," Britain is often scolded as a "traitor to Europe" and a "traitor to the West" in order to maintain high pressure on Britain. For example, the "whispers" about Britain's lack of support for Italy's participation in the Foreign Ministers' Meeting spread to such an extent that a British Foreign Office spokesman had to issue a special statement, denouncing this claim as "absurd."
    In some occasions, the conflict between the West German-French "axis" and Britain seems very prominent. However, everyone knows that the West German militarists are currently the U.S.'s "closest allies" in Western Europe, and West Germany currently relies on U.S. support and listens to the U.S. Therefore, some of the disputes between West Germany and France and Britain actually reflect the contradictions between the U.S. and Britain.
    Throughout the "Western front," the United States is still playing the main manipulative role, and its allies, including Britain, are still basically following the U.S. line. So far, Britain's performance at the Geneva conference has been timid and cautious, repeatedly echoing the U.S. at public meetings. However, it can also be seen over the past four weeks that the contradictions between Western countries are expanding. The United States can no longer completely control everything with "strength" as it did in the past. It is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with its allies. "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger wrote in an article published on June 1st that when negotiating with the Soviet Union in Geneva, the internal divisions of the West made the Western countries "simultaneously stabbing each other in the back." This is the picture behind the Geneva "Western common front."

### 外长会议上西方分歧扩大  美国控制大感吃力“共同阵线”不易维持

    外长会议上西方分歧扩大
    美国控制大感吃力“共同阵线”不易维持
    新华社日内瓦8日电　本社记者万光报道：日内瓦外长会议四个多星期以来，西方国家实际上一直在同时进行着两种会谈。一种当然是东西方国家外长间的会议，另一种则是“西方阵线”内部不断进行的幕后会商。
    每天，西方外长或者他们的助手、专家，都要举行这样的会商，来拟订或者重新拟订它们的
  “共同战略”，少则一次，多则数次。例如，5月30日，东西方外长在下午五点多钟刚结束会议后，西方三国外长就立即同西德外长勃伦塔诺开会，商量当天晚间八点钟在葛罗米柯晚宴上进行的非正式会谈中西方将如何行事。其紧张的程度可见一斑。
    依靠这样的幕后商谈，到目前为止，西方国家在东西方外长会议上勉强保持一条“共同阵线”，一次又一次地拒绝苏联关于缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领状态的建议。
    在反对缔结对德和约、把西德保持在北大西洋侵略集团里、加深德国的分裂以及企图让它们在西柏林的占领军赖着不走等方面，西方国家的立场是一致的。但是，在苏联的和平创议深入人心的情况下，西方不能光是说“不”，总得要提出一些“主张”来应付搪塞。这就有问题了。而且，在西方国家中也不乏有想利用目前局势来争取自己在西方内部的激烈利害冲突中占上风的。美国专栏作家李普曼就说过，日内瓦谈判对西方说来“非常困难”的原因之一是，“西方盟国对于什么是它们所一致愿意接受的东西这一点还不曾取得充分的协议”。
    在日内瓦会议期间，似乎可以看到在“西方阵线”里立下了这样一条维护“大西洋秩序”的“戒律”：只有西方四国取得“共同意见”的议题和计划才准许在外长会议上提出；在一切没有“共同意见”的方面不准谁“单独行动”，不准在会议桌上提出，也不准在正式场合谈论。
    在6月5日外长会议的全体会议上便出现了显示这种“秩序”的一个场面。当时，苏联外长葛罗米柯要求西方国家澄清对于在国际争端中摒弃使用武力和在欧洲建立限制军备区两个问题的态度，而美国国务卿赫脱在“回答”时完全答非所问，其他西方国家外长个个闷不吭声。第二天的“纽约先驱论坛报”点出了原因何在：葛罗米柯“触及了西方最大弱点之一”。限制军备区和互不侵犯原本是英国政府有兴趣的概念。虽然在它的盟国的压力下，英国在目前的会议上未敢正式再提，但是促使英国考虑过这些概念的现实依然是存在的。因此当葛罗米柯突然提到这些问题时，西方国家不仅没有“共同意见”，而且连走进另一个密室会商一下如何对答的机会都没有，只好各显窘态了。
    上周里，在这里的“记者之家”还广泛流传着一件“内幕新闻”：劳埃德在一次同西方记者的私下谈话中表示英国在西柏林问题上有某些主张还没有提出，赫脱接着便向劳埃德重申了“大西洋的秩序”的“戒律”。于是第二天劳埃德在公开会议上又表示他“同意赫脱所说的话”。
    像这条“内幕新闻”所显示的那种规律，实际上已经在日内瓦会议期间反复出现过好多次了。
    除了赫脱的“大西洋秩序”的“戒律”以外，还有在这里西方代表团人员聚集的地方和“记者之家”里西方记者圈子内盛行的一种“耳语运动”。这一运动的主要矛头也是针对着英国的。西德和法国的官员和记者以及美国记者是这种“耳语运动”的积极参加者，而美国官方则在其中煽风点火。在这些“耳语”中经常责骂英国是“欧洲的叛徒”，“西方的叛徒”，以保持对英国的高压。例如，关于英国不支持意大利参加外长会议的“耳语”传播到了这种程度，以致英国外交部发言人不得不专门发表声明，指责这种说法是“荒谬的”。
    在某些场合里，西德—法国“轴心”同英国之间的冲突显得很突出。但是，谁都知道，西德军国主义者是美国目前在西欧的“最亲密的盟友”，西德目前是靠美国的扶植和听美国的话的。因此，西德和法国同英国之间的一些争论，剥开来看实际上是反映了美英矛盾。
    在整个“西方阵线”里，目前依然是美国在起着主要的操纵作用，英国等盟国仍然都基本上跟随美国的路线行事。到目前为止，英国在日内瓦会议上的表现是畏畏缩缩，谨小慎微，在公开会议上一再给美国帮腔。但是，四个多星期来也可以看到，西方国家之间的矛盾在扩大。美国已经不能像过去那样凭“实力”完全控制一切了。在对付它的盟国上，已经越来越吃力了。“纽约时报”记者苏兹贝格在6月1日发表的文章里形容说：在日内瓦同苏联谈判的时候，西方内部的分歧使得西方国家“彼此间正在同时把刀子插进对方的脊背”。这便是日内瓦“西方共同阵线”幕后的图景。
