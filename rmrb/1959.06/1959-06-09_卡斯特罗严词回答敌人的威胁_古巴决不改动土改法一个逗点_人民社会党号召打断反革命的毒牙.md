    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 8th: Prime Minister Castro told reporters at a meeting commemorating Freedom of the Press Day on the 7th that Cuba "will not change a comma in the Land Reform Law." Castro emphasized that although land reform has aroused opposition, "the enemy has only stimulated the progress of the revolution."
    Castro also said that the revolutionary forces in Cuba know how to defend the revolution.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 7th: "Today's News" published a statement by the National Committee Executive Bureau of the People's Socialist Party on the 7th, calling for consolidating Cuba's armed forces and training workers, peasants, and students so that they can be mobilized at the necessary moment to give a fatal blow to counter-revolutionaries and interventionists.
    The statement said that the threat against the Cuban revolution is growing. The US imperialism and the big plantation owners, enraged by the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, are carrying out threats and intensifying various conspiracies.
    The statement pointed out that the imperialist threats and conspiracies include: reducing Cuba's sugar import quotas, restricting certain commercial activities in order to create an artificial shortage of certain goods in Cuba; trying to establish a police force of the Organization of American States against Cuba; allowing and encouraging Masferrer and his entourage, who fled from Cuba, to conduct activities in the United States; intensifying reinforcements to the Guantanamo Naval Base; sending their agents and provocateurs to Cuba to help organize counter-revolutions, and openly advocating armed intervention through the mouth of Preston Moore, head of the American Legion.
    The statement said that the activities of domestic counter-revolutionaries are also very active. They are using all contradictions to provoke all kinds of discontent.
    The statement concluded that if the counter-revolutionary groups dare to take risks, the Cuban people must break their fangs and smash them to pieces. If foreign countries intervene, the people of the whole country will rise up unanimously, forming a Great Wall of steel, and defend the independence, sovereignty, and dignity of the motherland at all costs.

    人民社会党号召打断反革命的毒牙
    新华社8日讯　哈瓦那消息：卡斯特罗总理7日在一个纪念新闻自由日的会议上对报界人士说，古巴“不会改动土地改革法的一个逗点”。卡斯特罗强调指出，虽然土地改革引起了反对，但是“敌人却正好刺激了革命前进”。
    卡斯特罗还说，古巴革命力量知道如何去保卫革命。
    新华社哈瓦那7日电　“今日报”7日发表了人民社会党全国委员会执行局的一项声明，号召巩固古巴的武装力量，训练工人、农民和学生，以便能在必要的时刻把他们动员起来，给反革命和干涉者以致命的打击。
    声明说，反对古巴革命的威胁正在增长。由于土地改革法的颁布而被激怒了的美帝国主义和大庄园主，正在进行威胁和加紧各种阴谋活动。
    声明指出，帝国主义的威胁和阴谋活动包括：缩减古巴糖入口定额，限制某些商业活动以便在古巴造成某些物品人为的紧张；力图建立一支反对古巴的美洲国家组织警察部队；容许并鼓动从古巴逃跑的马斯费雷尔及其随从人员在美国进行活动；加紧增援关塔那摩海军基地；把他们的代理人和挑拨者派到古巴去帮助组织反革命，并通过美洲军团首脑普列士顿·穆尔的口说出要采取公开的武装干涉。
    声明说，国内反革命分子的活动也非常活跃。他们正在利用一切矛盾，挑起种种的不满。
    声明最后指出，如果反革命集团要冒险的话，古巴人民一定要打断他们的毒牙，叫他们粉身碎骨。如果外国进行干涉，全国人民将一致奋起，形成一座万里长城，不惜一切牺牲地保卫祖国的独立、主权和尊严。
