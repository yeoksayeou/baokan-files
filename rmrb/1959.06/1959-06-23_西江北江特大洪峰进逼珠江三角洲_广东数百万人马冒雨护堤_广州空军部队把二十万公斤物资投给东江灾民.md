Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd - Today, the extraordinary flood peak of the North River has arrived near the Pearl River Delta ahead of schedule. The extraordinary flood peak of the West River is still within Guangxi Province. As the two flood peaks are pressing towards the Pearl River Delta, the flood situation is even more urgent. However, the water level and flow rate of the flood peaks are slightly lower than expected. Currently, millions of flood-fighting forces in Guangdong Province are scattered along the dikes, patrolling and working in the rain, vigilantly awaiting. The people within the dikes are stepping up the harvesting of ripe early rice and soon-to-be-ripe early rice to prevent any eventuality.

After heavy rains caused a flood peak in the upper and middle reaches of the West River, spanning Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, on the 19th, the West River's flood peak increased again on the morning of the 20th due to torrential rain in the Nanning and Qianjiang areas of Guangxi, with rainfall reaching about 100 millimeters. This flood peak reached Guiping County in Guangxi at 8:00 AM this morning, and is expected to reach Gao Yao, near the Pearl River Delta, on the morning of the 24th. At that time, the water level of the West River near Gao Yao will rise from today's 10.81 meters to 11.50 meters, and the flow rate will increase from today's 34,000 cubic meters per second to more than 37,000 cubic meters per second. The highest recorded water level of the West River in history is 12.91 meters, a difference of 1.41 meters.

The North River flood peak arrived earlier than expected yesterday. It was originally estimated that the flood peak would reach Shijiao, near the Pearl River Delta, on the 23rd, but it arrived this morning, with a flood peak water level of 10.63 meters and a flow rate of 7,000 cubic meters per second, lower than the historical high water level of 14.2 meters.

The above-mentioned flood peak flow and water levels are slightly lower than expected. Even with today's heavy rainfall in the Guangzhou area, it is estimated that the flow rate will not exceed 53,000 cubic meters per second after the West River, North River, and Pearl River Delta flood peaks meet the high tide on the 24th. This is beneficial to the flood control struggle in the West River, North River, and Pearl River Delta.

Today, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chen Yu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Guangdong Province, and all secretaries of the Secretariat, as well as responsible cadres of the provincial, municipal, party, government, and military organizations, personally went to the dikes to direct the flood control work. Local prefectural and county party secretaries are leading millions of troops, braving heavy rain, to patrol the dikes. To prepare for any eventuality on the North River dike, people are evenly distributing piles of sand, stones, and sacks, so that any dangerous situation can be immediately rescued.

In the prelude to the decisive battle against the flood peak, people's communes in the Pearl River Delta also organized large teams to harvest the 220,000 mu of ripe early rice within the dikes. In Zhongshan County, more than 100,000 people, led by five county party secretaries, went to the front to prevent floods and protect dikes, while more than 60,000 people were mobilized to harvest early rice. Government cadres, workers, and residents in Zhongshan County also picked up sickles and tools to support rice harvesting in various production teams.

While fighting floods and conducting rescue operations, the people on both sides of the West River and North River also organized a harvesting army to cut down early rice and other crops that were more than 70% ripe. The Jiangmen Special District in the West River Basin implemented a method of fully engaging in flood prevention at night and sending people to harvest during the day, and has already harvested 200,000 mu. The Shaoguan Special District in the North River Basin has also harvested more than 132,000 mu of early rice in the past few days.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd - Correspondent Chen Shiji and Han Kexuan reported: From June 16th to 20th, the Guangzhou Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army dispatched 121 aircraft sorties, dropping more than 206,000 kilograms of grain, bedding, medicine, and communication equipment to the people in the disaster-stricken areas of Dongjiang, Guangdong. Many people surrounded by floods received these supplies, and many were moved to tears. They affectionately called these airdropping grain planes "the savior of the victims" and "the divine eagle sent by Chairman Mao to save lives."

In mid-June, Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, Dongguan, and other counties in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River suffered severe flood disasters. Many people were surrounded by floods, and food supplies were cut off. On the 15th, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the Guangzhou Air Force to carry out airdrop relief missions. The leaders of the Guangzhou Air Force immediately made combat deployments, organized all the aircraft responsible for airdrop missions, and went to the front line of disaster relief. The officers and soldiers of the troops were all excited and unanimously expressed that they would overcome all difficulties to ensure the completion of the airdrop relief mission. Female pilot and Communist Party member Xue Wenshu said: "We are the people's soldiers, and the people are our own parents. We must overcome difficulties and deliver the supplies to the people in the disaster areas quickly and accurately."

Under the slogan of "Rescuing the Victims, Every Second Counts," the officers and soldiers of the troops immediately took action in a combat posture. The aircrews combined the weather, routes, and targets at the time to specifically study how to airdrop accurately and quickly. The ground crews also carried out intensive pre-flight maintenance work. Personnel from the agency brigades and various service detachments volunteered to form temporary loading assault teams and airdrop teams.

This disaster relief airdrop strongly supported the flood prevention struggle of the disaster victims in the Dongjiang area of Guangdong, greatly boosted the confidence of the disaster victims in overcoming floods and persisting in production for self-reliance. Whenever the planes flew over the disaster area, the masses gathered on the hills jumped and cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party!" Disaster victim Liu Guirun said excitedly: "We have suffered from floods that have never been seen in history, but under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and with the strong support of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we have received timely assistance. We will never forget the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao."

### 西江北江特大洪峰进逼珠江三角洲  广东数百万人马冒雨护堤  广州空军部队把二十万公斤物资投给东江灾民

    西江北江特大洪峰进逼珠江三角洲
    广东数百万人马冒雨护堤
    广州空军部队把二十万公斤物资投给东江灾民
    新华社广州22日电　今天，北江的特大洪峰已经提前到达珠江三角洲附近，西江的特大洪峰尚在广西境内，由于两个洪峰正在压向珠江三角洲，汛情更加紧急。但洪峰的水位和流量都较预计的稍低。现在，广东省数百万防汛大军满布堤围，正在冒雨巡逻和抢工，日夜严阵以待。堤围内的人民群众加紧抢割已熟早稻和即将成熟的早稻，以防万一。
    横跨粤、桂两省的西江上游和中游，19日前因大雨出现洪峰后，20日晨八点又因广西南宁、迁江地区暴雨雨量达一百公厘左右，使西江的洪峰加大。这个洪峰今晨八时，已到广西的桂平县，预计24日晨可能到达靠近珠江三角洲的高要。高要附近的西江水位那时将从今天的十点八一公尺，上升到十一点五零公尺，流量将由今天的三万四千秒公方上升到三万七千秒公方以上。西江有历史记载以来的最高水位是十二点九一公尺，相差一点四一公尺。
    北江洪峰较昨日预计提前到来。原估计，洪峰将在23日到珠江三角洲附近的石角，但是在今天早晨就到了，洪峰水位是十点六三公尺，流量七千秒公方。较有历史记载以来的十四点二公尺最高水位为低。
    上述洪峰流量和水位都较预计的稍低，即使加上今日广州地区的大雨雨量，西江、北江洪峰与大潮三者于24日相碰后，流量估计不会超过五万三千秒公方。这对西江、北江、珠江三角洲的防洪斗争是有利的。
    今天，中共广东省委第一书记陶铸，省委书记处书记、广东省省长陈郁和书记处所有书记，省、市党政军民负责干部都亲自到堤上指挥防汛工作。各地地委和县委书记，正率领数百万大军，冒着大雨在堤围上巡逻。北江大堤为防备万一，人们正把堆积如山的砂石、麻袋均匀地分布开来，以便那里发现险情，立刻抢救。
    在准备和洪峰决战的前夕，珠江三角洲各人民公社也组织了大队人马，抢割了堤围内已成熟的二十二万亩早稻。中山县有十多万群众，由五个县委书记率领到前面防洪护堤，后面又出动了六万多人抢割早稻。中山县的机关干部和职工、居民也拿起镰刀和工具到各个生产队去支援割稻。
    西江，北江两岸的人民，在抗洪抢险的同时，也组织了抢收大军，把有七成熟以上的早稻和其他作物，抢割下来。西江流域的江门专区实行了晚上全部投入防洪，白天派人抢割的办法，已抢割了二十万亩。北江流域的韶关专区，这几天抢割的早稻也有十三万二千多亩。
    据新华社广州22日电　本社通讯员陈世基、韩克暄报道：中国人民解放军广州地区空军部队从6月16日到20日，连续出动飞机一百二十一架次，将二十万六千多公斤粮食、被服、药品和通讯器材空投给广东东江受灾地区的人民。被洪水围困着的许多群众，收到了这些物资，不少人感激得热泪交流。他们亲切地称这些空投粮食的飞机是“灾民的救星”、“毛主席派来救命的神鹰”。
    6月中旬，东江下游的惠阳、博罗、增城、东莞等县，遭受了严重的洪水灾害。许多群众被洪水包围，粮源断绝。15日，中共广东省委指示广州空军部队执行空投救灾任务。广州空军首长立即进行战斗部署，将所有担负空投任务的飞机组织起来，开赴救灾前线。部队广大官兵人人心情激动，一致表示要克服一切困难，保证完成空投救灾任务。女飞行员、共产党员薛文淑说：“我们是人民的子弟兵，人民就是我们的亲爹娘，我们一定要克服困难，把物资迅速准确的送到灾区人民的手里”。
    在“抢救灾民、分秒必争”的口号下，部队官兵都以战斗姿态，立即行动起来。空勤人员结合当时的气象、航线、目标，具体研究如何空投得准确、迅速。地勤人员也紧张进行飞行前的检修工作。机关大队和各勤务分队的人员自动报名，组成了临时装运突击队和空投组。
    这次救灾空投，有力地支援了广东东江地区灾民的防洪斗争，大大地鼓舞了灾民战胜洪水、坚持生产自救的信心。每当飞机飞临灾区上空时，聚集在山头上的群众都跳跃欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”灾民刘贵润激动地说：“我们遭受到历年来从未见过的大洪水，但在共产党毛主席的英明领导和中国人民解放军的大力支援下，得到了及时的接济。党和毛主席的恩情，我们永远忘不了。”
