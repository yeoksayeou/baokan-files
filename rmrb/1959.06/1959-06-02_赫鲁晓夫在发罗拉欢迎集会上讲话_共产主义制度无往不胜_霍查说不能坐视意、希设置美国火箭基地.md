Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 1st. The head of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation, Khrushchev, and delegation members Malinovsky and Ivanov, visited Vlora on May 31st, accompanied by Albanian Party and Government leaders such as Hoxha, Shehu, and Kambo.

    A grand mass rally was held in Vlora's "Flag Square". When the Soviet guests and Albanian leaders appeared on the rostrum, the square erupted in thunderous applause and cheers.

    Albanian Labor Party Central Committee First Secretary Hoxha spoke at the meeting. In his speech, he talked about Albania's socialist construction achievements and the continuous consolidation and development of friendship between the Albanian and Soviet peoples.

    Hoxha pointed out that the socialist camp is already very strong, and anyone who dares to touch it will lose their head. The attempts by imperialist jackals and their lackey revisionists to stop the wheels of history are futile.

    Hoxha said that our Party and government have consistently pursued a Leninist policy of peace and friendship among all countries. We hope to develop good-neighborly relations and friendly cooperation with neighboring countries on the principles of equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

    Referring to the plans of the ruling groups in Italy and Greece to set up American atomic and rocket bases on their territories, Hoxha emphasized that Albania cannot stand idly by in the face of such hostile acts and must take measures to defend the country's freedom and independence and defend the inviolability of the socialist camp. If the leading groups in Italy and Greece think that their plans and actions will scare Albania, they are greatly mistaken.

    Khrushchev then spoke. He said that the best friendly relations exist between the Soviet people and the Albanian people, and between the two countries' parties and governments. Khrushchev said that we will do everything possible to make this fraternal friendship as solid as a rock forever.

    Khrushchev went on to say that communism, which replaces capitalism, is bound to win because it signifies a new and higher stage of social development, because it eliminates all the contradictions inherent in capitalism, and because it opens up unprecedentedly broad prospects for the development of science and technology and all social vitality. Communism is the long-cherished wish of the working people and the bright future of mankind. No matter how hard decadent capitalism tries to prolong its life, it is doomed to die, because a new and invincible communist system is replacing it. Khrushchev emphasized that some madmen in the imperialist camp are threatening peace with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. Their arrogant policy is signing the death warrant for the capitalist world, and the time is not far off when mankind will bury capitalism even deeper.

    Khrushchev said that the level of Soviet industrial development is already higher than that of any capitalist country except the United States. In the near future, the United States will also be left behind.

    Referring to the strengthening of the economic power of the Soviet Union and the socialist countries, Khrushchev pointed out that if the imperialists try to attack us, then we will be able to give them an irresistible blow. Khrushchev emphasized that the imperialists know our strength. Attacking us is tantamount to suicide, and only a madman would do that.

    Khrushchev emphasized that the Marxist-Leninist party is the great organizing force of the people of socialist countries. In order to move forward smoothly, it is necessary to further strengthen the ranks of the workers' and communist parties and unite the people more closely around our party. We must constantly struggle to purify Marxism-Leninism and oppose opportunism and revisionism. We must remain vigilant. He emphasized that today, opposing opportunism and revisionism is the main issue in constantly strengthening the ranks of our party.

    On June 1st, the Albanian newspapers "People's Voice" and "Unity" published a letter from the Soviet Party and Government Delegation to the editorial departments of the two newspapers. In this letter, the members of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation thanked the Albanian people for the thousands of letters and telegrams they wrote to the delegation, expressing welcome and best wishes to the delegation and the Soviet people.

    A part of the members of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation, led by Muhitdinov, returned to Moscow by special plane on May 31st. Among those who went to the airport to see them off were Albanian Party and Government leaders Hoxha, Shehu, Leshi, Nushi, Belishova, Muftiu, Koleka, and others.

    赫鲁晓夫在发罗拉欢迎集会上讲话
    共产主义制度无往不胜
    霍查说不能坐视意、希设置美国火箭基地
    新华社地拉那1日电　苏联党政代表团团长赫鲁晓夫和代表团团员马利诺夫斯基和伊凡诺夫，5月31日由霍查、谢胡、卡博等阿尔巴尼亚党政领导人陪同到达发罗拉市访问。
    在发罗拉的“旗帜广场”上举行了盛大的群众欢迎会。当苏联客人和阿尔巴尼亚领导人出现在主席台上时，广场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查在会上讲了话。他在讲话
  中谈到了阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设成就以及不断巩固和发展的阿苏两国人民的友谊。
    霍查指出，社会主义阵营已经十分强大，谁敢动一动它，谁就要碰掉脑袋。帝国主义豺狼和他们的奴仆修正主义者想要阻止历史车轮转动的企图是枉费心机的。
    霍查说，我们党和政府过去和现在一贯奉行列宁主义的和平和各国友谊的政策。我们希望同邻国在平等、相互尊重和互利以及和平共处的原则的基础上发展睦邻关系和友好合作。
    霍查在谈到意大利和希腊两国的统治集团打算在本国的领土上设置美国的原子和火箭基地的问题时强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚对这种敌对行为不能袖手旁观，它必须采取措施来保卫国家的自由和独立，保卫社会主义阵营的不可侵犯性。如果意大利和希腊的领导集团竟认为他们的计划和行动会把阿尔巴尼亚吓倒，那他们就大错特错了。
    接着赫鲁晓夫讲了话。他说，在苏联人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民之间、在两国党和政府之间存在着最好的友好关系。赫鲁晓夫说，我们将尽一切努力使这种兄弟友谊永远像磐石那样巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，代替资本主义的共产主义之所以必然胜利，是因为它标志着社会发展新的更高阶段，是因为它消除资本主义所固有的一切矛盾，为科学技术的发展和社会一切生命力的发展开辟空前未有的广阔天地。共产主义是劳动人民的夙愿，人类的光辉未来，不管腐朽的资本主义怎样努力企图苟延残喘，它是注定要死亡的，因为一个新的无往不胜的共产主义制度正在代替它。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，帝国主义营垒中的一些狂人正在用原子弹、氢弹威胁和平。他们这种狂妄政策是在给资本主义世界送终，使人类更深地埋葬资本主义的时候已经不远了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的工业发展水平已经比除美国以外的任何资本主义国家都要高。不久的将来，美国也要落在后头。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到苏联和社会主义各国经济威力的加强时指出，如果帝国主义者企图进攻我们，那么我们就能够给他们以无法抵挡的打击。赫鲁晓夫强调说，帝国主义者知道我们的力量。进攻我们就等于自杀，只有疯子才要这样做。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，马克思列宁主义政党是社会主义国家人民伟大的组织力量。为了顺利前进，必须进一步加强工人党和共产党的队伍，把人民更加紧密地团结在我们党的周围。必须经常进行斗争，以纯洁马克思列宁主义，反对机会主义和修正主义。我们应当保持警惕。他着重指出，今天，反对机会主义和修正主义是不断加强我们党的队伍中的主要问题。
    6月1日，阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”和“团结报”刊登了苏联党政代表团给这两家报纸编辑部的一封信。苏联党政代表团成员在这封信里感谢阿尔巴尼亚人民给代表团写的数以千计的信件和电报。这些信件和电报向代表团和苏联人民表示欢迎和祝愿。
    苏联党政代表团一部分团员，5月31日由穆希金诺夫率领乘专机返回莫斯科。到机场欢送的有阿尔巴尼亚党和政府领导人霍查、谢胡、列希、努什、别利绍娃、穆夫蒂乌、科列加等。
