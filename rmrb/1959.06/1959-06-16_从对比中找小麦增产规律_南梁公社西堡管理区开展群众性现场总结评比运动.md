Finding Wheat Yield Increase Patterns Through Comparison
    Xibao Management Area of Nanliang Commune Launches Mass On-Site Summary and Evaluation Movement

    Taiyuan, June 15th (This newspaper) -- Xibao Management Area of Nanliang Commune in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, has launched a mass wheat summary and evaluation movement through team-to-team, type-to-type, and plot-to-plot comparisons. This effectively improved commune members' agricultural scientific knowledge, deeply rooted the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and laid the foundation for striving for greater agricultural harvests.

    This year, the 3,060 mu of wheat planted in the Xibao Management Area is mostly growing very well. The old man, Li Baoqing, said: "I have lived for seventy-seven years, through four dynasties, and have worked as a farmer for fifty-two years, but only this year has the wheat grown exceptionally well." Why is the wheat growing so well? The cadres and the masses have different views. Some say that the People's Commune demonstrates its superiority and the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture has blossomed; some say that the weather is favorable, and the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have great fortune; some say... But looking at the wheat growth, there are high-yield fields and also third-class fields. In these two types of wheat fields, there are irrigated lands and dry lands; there are primary crops and secondary crops; there are even cases where the same land under the same cultivation conditions shows completely different growth; and even good land is not as good as bad land, and irrigated land is not as good as dry land. How can these phenomena be explained? In response to the different understandings of the cadres and the masses, the management area party branch, focusing on the different characteristics of wheat growth, adopted five major methods of listening, watching, comparing, calculating, and debating, centering on the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and carried out a wheat summary and evaluation movement among teams, plots, and individuals in the fields.

    Before the mass evaluation and summary movement, the management area party branch first hired twenty-five people, including old farmers, middle-aged people, young people, women, and cadres, to conduct a general survey of the wheat in the ten production teams of the seven natural villages. Repeated comparisons were made in the field between types (primary crop, secondary crop, irrigated land, dry land, etc.) and words (water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, management, labor), and typical plots of opposing sides were found. After joint research, field summary signs were placed on the typical wheat fields. The sign clearly stated the manager, land grade, primary or secondary crop, irrigated or dry land, tillage depth and time, fertilizer quality, quantity, and time, sowing time and quantity, variety, number and time of watering, and so on. Then, the captain led the masses to visit the fields, and the commune members who operated the fields explained on the spot, visiting, discussing, summarizing, and evaluating at the same time. Because this method is visual and personal, can be seen and heard, is simple and clear, easy to understand, and highly comparative, it provided all commune members with a vivid technical education.

    In the wheat field of the ninth team, Zhang Linghe, who sowed the seeds himself, introduced the situation of the three plots of land plowed with single-horse plows, double-horse plows, and rotary tillers. The soil quality of these three plots was the same, first-class land, all secondary crops, but because the depth of plowing was different, the yield varied greatly. Old commune member Wang Qiuzhong said while watching: "Single-horse, double-horse, rotary tilling, each is stronger than the other, where deep plowing reaches, yield increases there." Deep plowing without fertilization is not enough. Liu Taiyuan, an old farmer from the fifth team, said: "Look, the twenty-six mu of wheat on the upper embankment and the three mu of wheat on the lower embankment have the same soil quality and cultivation, but the base fertilizer per mu differs by forty loads, and the yield will differ by at least one hundred catties." Sowing too sparsely or too densely will reduce production, which is everyone's common comment. The twenty-five mu of experimental fields cultivated by the cadres of the entire management area had more than forty-five catties of seeds sown per mu, plus the land was fertile, not ventilated, and not transparent to light, so every mu fell over. The four mu behind the embankment sowed twenty-eight catties of seeds, and the five mu of the Martyrs' Monument sowed eighteen catties of seeds, and the growth was completely different. After discussion, the yield of the forty-six catties of sowing was not as high as that of the twenty-eight catties, and the yield of the eighteen catties of sowing was not as high as that of the twenty-eight catties. The timing of sowing also has a great relationship with yield. The two plots of land, east and west of Yitang Road in the ninth team, differed in sowing time by twelve days, and the yield per mu differed by one hundred catties. Timely sowing must also be well managed. The nine mu of wheat at Gaojiageng and the eight mu of wheat at Nanjiageng in the first team were the same land, but because they were top-dressed once less and watered once less, the former yielded eighty catties per mu less than the latter.

    Through visits, team-to-team, type-to-type, plot-to-plot, and word-to-word comparisons were carried out, and the experience of wheat yield increase in the entire management area was summarized, so that the masses realized that the "Eight-Point Charter" must be fully, adequately, and timely implemented. Everyone unanimously reflected that one day of field visits and evaluations yielded more gains than half a lifetime of farming.

    从对比中找小麦增产规律
    南梁公社西堡管理区开展群众性现场总结评比运动
    本报太原15日电　山西翼城县南梁公社西堡管理区，通过队队比、类类比、块块比，开展群众性小麦总结评比运动，有效地提高了社员的农业科学知识，使农业增产“八字宪法”深入人心，为争取农业更大丰产奠定基础。
    西堡管理区今年种植的三千零六十亩小麦，大部生长都非常好。李宝庆老汉说：“我活了七十七岁，经过四个朝代，做了五十二年庄稼，唯有今年小麦长得格外好。”小麦为什么长得这样好？广大干部和群众各有不同的看法。有的说是人民公社显示了优越性，农业“八字宪法”开了花；有的说是老天爷风调雨顺，共产党和毛主席福气大；有的说……但是就小麦生长情况来看，有高额丰产田，也有三类田。在这两类麦田中，有水地、有旱地；有正茬、有回茬；有同等地在同等耕作条件下，生长好坏截然不同；甚至还有好地不如坏地，水地不如旱地。这种种现象又怎样解释呢？管理区党支部针对广大干部和群众的不同认识，抓住小麦生长的不同特点，采取了听、看、比、算、辩五大方法，以农业“八字宪法”为中心，在田间开展了队与队、块与块、人与人的小麦总结评比运动。
    在群众性的评比总结运动之前，管理区党支部首先聘请老农、中年、青年、妇女和干部二十五人，对七个自然村十个生产队的小麦进行了普查。在田间进行了类与类（正茬、回茬、水地、旱地等类型）、字与字（水、肥、土、种、密、保、管、工）反复对比，找到了各种对立面的典型地块，经过共同研究，插上典型地小麦田间总结牌。牌上写清管理人员、土地等级、正茬还是回茬、水地还是旱地、耕地深度和时间、施肥质量、数量和时间、下种时间和数量、品种、浇水次数和时间等等。然后由队长带领群众到田间参观，由亲手操作的社员当场说明，边参观、边讨论、边总结、边评比。由于这种方法见物见人，能看能听，简便明了，通俗易懂，对比性强，使全体社员受到一次活生生的技术教育。
    在九队的麦田里，亲手播种的张凌河，介绍了用单套牲口犁、双套牲口犁和用铣翻的三块地的情况。这三块地土质一样，是一等地，都是回茬，就是因为耕的深度不同，产量相差很大。老社员王秋忠边看边说：“单套、双套、铣翻，一样比一样强，深耕到那里，就增产到那里。”只深耕不施肥，也不行。第五队老农刘太原说：“你们看，这上堰二十六亩麦和下堰三亩麦，土质、耕作都一样，只是每亩底肥相差四十担，产量至少相差一百多斤。”播种过稀或过密都会减产，这是大家共同的评语。全管理区干部培植的二十五亩试验田，下籽都在四十五斤以上，加上地力大，不通风，不透光，亩亩都倒伏。后堰四亩下籽二十八斤，烈士碑五亩下籽十八斤，生长截然不同。经过评论，下种四十六斤的产量不如二十八斤的高，下籽十八斤的产量也不如二十八斤的高。下种迟早对产量也有很大关系。九队的衣堂路东和路西两块地，播种时间相差十二天，产量每亩差百十来斤。种麦适时还必须管理得好。一队高家坆九亩麦和南界八亩麦是同样的地，只是少追一次肥，少浇一次水，前者比后者每亩产量相差八十斤。
    通过参观，进行了队队、类类、块块、字字对比，总结了全管理区小麦丰产经验，使群众认识到“八字宪法”必须全面、适量、适时地执行。大家一致反映说，田间参观评比一天，比做半辈子庄稼收获都大。
