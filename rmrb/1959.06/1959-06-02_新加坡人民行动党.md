    Singapore People's Action Party
    The People's Action Party of Singapore won the first Legislative Assembly election in Singapore, achieving internal self-government, securing 43 of the 51 Legislative Assembly seats.
    The People's Action Party was founded in November 1954 and currently has 14,000 members. The current chairman is Toh Chin Chye, and the secretary-general is Lee Kuan Yew.
    The People's Action Party is a social democratic party. It has a greater influence among intellectuals and the general petty bourgeoisie. In the 1955 election conducted under the deceptive old constitution, the People's Action Party only won three seats in the Legislative Assembly. In recent years, it has achieved great victories in local elections. The party leader, Ong Eng Guan, has been re-elected as the mayor of Singapore City twice.
    The People's Action Party is internally divided into two factions: the "radical faction" and the "moderate faction." The "radical faction" advocates a more resolute approach in opposing colonialism. In 1956, Lin Xiangyang, a representative of the "radical faction," was arrested. In 1957, Chen Congjin, Chen Gongyuan, and others of the "radical faction" who held positions such as party chairman and executive committee member were arrested for violating the "Public Security Ordinance." Currently, the "moderate faction" has greater influence. Lee Kuan Yew, Ong Eng Guan, and others belong to the "moderate faction."
    After the People's Action Party wins this Legislative Assembly election, the government will be organized by the party's secretary-general, Lee Kuan Yew. (De)

    新加坡人民行动党
    新加坡人民行动党在新加坡实现内部自治的第一届立法议会选举中获胜，取得五十一个立法会议席位中的四十三席。
    人民行动党成立于1954年11月，现有党员一万四千人，现任主席杜进才，总书记李光耀。
    人民行动党是个社会民主党类型的政党。它在知识分子和一般小资产阶级中影响较大。1955年在按照欺骗性的旧宪法进行的选举中，人民行动党仅获立法会议的三个席位。近几年在地方选举中取得很大胜利，该党领袖王永元二次连任新加坡市市长。
    人民行动党内部分为两派：“激进派”和“温和派”“激进派”在反对殖民主义等方面主张采取更坚决的方针。1956年“激进派”代表林祥洋被捕，1957年分别担任该党主席、执委等职的“激进派”陈从今、陈贡元等又以违反“公共安全法令”被捕。目前“温和派”势力较大。李光耀、王永元等均属“温和派”。
    人民行动党在这次立法议会选举中获胜后，将由该党总书记李光耀组织政府。　　　　　　（德）
