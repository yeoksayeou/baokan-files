According to Guangxi Daily news, in the past two months, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has held materials exchange meetings in various places, which has further invigorated the rural market, expanded the circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas, and promoted the development of production. According to incomplete statistics, as of mid-May, 648 communes in the region have successively held large or small material exchange meetings with the commune or production brigade as the unit; the communes holding exchange meetings accounted for 60.65% of the total number of communes in the region.

Before the exchange meetings were held, all communes, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, made full preparations. Many communes established special leading bodies for material exchange, and used various forms of publicity to explain the significance of holding material exchange meetings to the masses, explained the principles of "equal exchange, cash on delivery," and encouraged commune members to sell agricultural and sideline products and local specialties. The commune's financial and trade departments used their rest time to organize the vast number of commune members to prepare exchange materials from all aspects. Various places organized a large number of financial and trade cadres to go deep into the communes and production teams to investigate the supply of goods, help the production teams to clarify the scope of production and sales of products by the team and commune members, and formulate specific exchange plans. Many places also held small and medium-sized sample exhibitions to introduce the varieties, specifications, and production, picking, and processing methods of the purchases.

After ideological mobilization and material preparation, the commune members participating in the exchange meetings sold surplus grain, oil, poultry, livestock, rosin, kapok, wild animals and plants and other products to the state. Among the more than 80,000 people who participated in the exchange meeting in Rong'an County, more than 95% brought goods for trading. On the day of the exchange meeting, the members of the Gaotian Commune in Yangshuo County sold more than 11,000 catties of surplus grain to the state.

Due to the convening of the material exchange meetings, the purchasing volume of the commercial departments has greatly increased. The purchasing department of Qintang Commune in Guixian County had a total purchasing amount of more than 315,000 yuan in one day at the exchange meeting, which overfulfilled the purchasing plan for the second quarter. After vigorously carrying out exchange meetings, the YueLi Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Nandan County had a total purchasing amount in April equivalent to the total purchasing amount in the first quarter, an increase of six times over the same period last year. The materials purchased by the commercial departments in Hengxian, Wuming and other counties at the exchange meetings were several times or dozens of times more than the materials purchased at the market days.

At the material exchange meetings, commercial departments and communes and production teams widely signed and revised contracts for the production and supply of various products according to the production situation and national needs, assisted production teams to quickly arrange production, and better linked short-term production and needs between urban and rural areas, achieving a combination of production, purchase, and sales. The contracts signed between the nine communes and sixty-three brigades of Tian'e County at the exchange meeting and the commercial departments amounted to 1.7 million yuan, including more than 90 varieties such as live pigs, beef cattle, ramie, and medicinal materials.

The convening of the material exchange meetings has mobilized the enthusiasm of commune members to expand diversified operations. They went to the mountains and rivers to collect, pick, catch, fish, dig, and process various local and special products, and restored the production of many small local and special products and small daily necessities. The variety of products on the market has generally increased compared with the past, and many out-of-stock commodities have met consumers again. After selling their products, the commune members increased their income and purchased various means of production and means of living. The cash earned from selling goods by the Baimianshan Brigade of Baisha Commune in Yangshuo is enough to pay the commune members' wages for two months. The members of Muge Commune in Guixian County also deposited more than 4,000 yuan of the cash they earned into the credit cooperative.

While holding material exchange meetings, various places paid attention to strengthening market management. The first and second categories of materials are uniformly purchased by the local state grain departments and state-owned commercial departments, and it is strictly forbidden for foreign units or individuals to raise prices or depress prices for purchases; the third category of materials are freely traded by each production team and commune member in accordance with the national listed price, and a few minor third categories of materials can also be priced independently within a certain range of the national listed price. On the basis of the material exchange meetings, some places have also restored market days, making the rural primary market more active. (Attached picture)

    农副产品卖给国家  生产资料买回公社
    广西农村市场物资大交流
    全区半数以上公社举办大小型交流会，扩大了城乡商品流通
    据广西日报消息  最近两个月来，广西僮族自治区各地召开了物资交流会，进一步活跃了农村市场，扩大了城乡商品流通，促进了生产的发展。据不完全的统计，截至5月中旬止，全区已有六百四十八个公社先后以公社或生产大队为单位召开了大型或小型物资交流会；召开交流会的公社占全区公社数的60.65％。
    在召开交流会以前，各个公社在党委统一领导下，进行了充分的准备工作。许多公社成立了物资交流的专门领导机构，并且运用各种宣传形式，向群众说明召开物资交流会的意义，解释“等价交换、现款现货”等原则，鼓励社员出售农副土特产品。公社财贸部门利用休息时间，组织广大社员从各方面准备交流的物资。各地组织了大批财贸干部深入公社、生产队，调查货源情况，帮助生产队划清队与社员生产和出售产品的范围，制订具体的交流规划。许多地方还举办了中小型样品展览，介绍收购品种、规格以及生产、采摘、加工等方法。
    经过思想发动和物资准备，各公社参加交流会的社员们纷纷把余粮、油料、家禽、家畜、松脂、木棉花、野生动植物和其他产品拿到会上卖给国家。融安县参加交流会的八万多人中，就有95％以上的人带了商品前来交易。阳朔县高田公社的社员们，在举行交流会那天，共出售余粮一万一千多斤给国家。
    由于物资交流会的召开，商业部门的收购额大大增加。贵县覃塘公社供销部在交流会上一天的收购总额达三十一万五千多元，超额完成了第二季度收购计划。南丹县月里公社供销部在大搞交流会以后，4月份收购总额相当于第一季度收购总和，比去年同期的收购额增加了六倍。横县、武鸣等县商业部门在交流会上收购的物资，都比平时在墟日收购的物资增加几倍或几十倍。
    在物资交流会上，商业部门和公社、生产队根据生产情况和国家需要，广泛签订和修订了各种产品的产供销合同，协助生产队迅速安排生产，更好地使城乡之间的短期生产和需要挂起钩来，做到了产、购、销三结合。天峨县九个公社六十三个大队在交流会上和商业部门签订的合同，金额达一百七十万元，包括生猪、菜牛、龙须草、药材等九十多个品种。
    物资交流会的召开，调动了社员们扩大多种经营的积极性。他们上山下水，采、摘、捕、捞、挖掘和加工各种土特产品，恢复了许多小土特产和日用小百货的生产。上市品种较过去普遍增加，有许多绝市商品又与消费者见了面。社员们在出售产品后，增加了收入，购回各种生产资料与生活资料。阳朔白沙公社白面山大队出卖商品所得现款，足够发给社员两个月的工资。贵县木格公社社员还把所得现款四千多元存入信用部。
    各地在召开物资交流会的同时，注意加强市场管理。一、二类物资统一由当地的国家粮食部门和国营商业部门收购，严禁外来单位或私人抬价压价收购；三类物资由各生产队和社员个人按国家规定的牌价自由交易，少数的次要的三类物资，也可以在国家牌价的一定幅度之内自行议价。在物资交流会的基础上，有些地方还恢复了墟日，使农村初级市场更趋活跃。（附图片）
