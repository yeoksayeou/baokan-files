Xinhua News Agency, June 15th – On the eve of graduation, university graduates across the country are writing letters to the Ministry of Education and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and other departments, expressing their firm obedience to state allocation, to go to factories, mines, rural areas, border regions, and wherever the motherland needs them, to contribute all their strength to the cause of socialist construction.

Recently, the Ministry of Education, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and other departments have received many letters from graduating students from universities across the country. Each letter is filled with enthusiasm, requesting the Party and the state to assign them to the most arduous places, the places where the motherland needs them most. The thirty-three graduating students of the Department of Architecture of South China Institute of Technology wrote in a joint letter: “We will always be good children of the Party, always loyal to the Party. Wherever the Party points, we will rush there. We guarantee not to make any conditions, not to care about any reward, and consciously and selflessly work. We will learn from the workers and peasants, and use our hands to build the motherland more prosperous, strong, and beautiful!” The joint letter from twenty-seven graduates of Subei Agricultural College wrote: “We are not afraid of the desolation of the great desert, not afraid of the unfamiliarity of people and places..., we do not miss our hometown and relatives, do not miss a peaceful and comfortable life, we want to go to the Great Northwest to build a new home, to make the Great Northwest of the motherland comparable to Suzhou and Hangzhou!” Cao Bingquan, a graduate of the Department of Biology and Botany of Sichuan University, wrote in a letter: “I am willing to fight for the victory over the desert for the rest of my life. I will closely unite with the comrades who have gone to the northwest desert area to transform nature, and we must transform the desert into a fertile and beautiful place with lush trees, colorful flowers, and singing birds!” Li Hanlin, Hu Junjing, Qi Shichi and other graduating students from Central China Normal College wrote letters requesting to go to rural people's communes and factories and mines, to virgin lands of primitive forests and wilderness. They wrote: “We are willing to go to all areas that need teachers, take root and sprout there, and bear fruit.” All graduating students of the Department of Planning and Statistics of Liaoning University listed the development and construction of border areas as their first choice. They said in their letters: “Now we obey the allocation of the motherland, and in the future, we will devote all our energy to doing a good job. We will never fail the Party's training, and we will always be good children of the Party and good servants of the people.” In the letters from all these young people, they also mentioned that their growth should be attributed to the education and training of the Party and the people. Many letters wrote: The Party gives them a good environment so that they can study, live and work with peace of mind; the education of the Party and the people over the years has made them understand that it is the greatest glory for a person to contribute all his strength to the realization of the magnificent socialist and communist construction cause. Go where the motherland needs you! Zhao Zhifang
