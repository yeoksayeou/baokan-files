    For Our Brotherly Nationalities
    One morning, while the sky was still a hazy gray and people had not yet risen, Comrade Shi Feng (Han nationality), the County Party Secretary of the Du'an Yao Autonomous County in Guangxi, was already in the fields with a double-furrow plow and several production team cadres. When the commune members saw that the secretary was taking the lead in using new-style farm tools, they all rushed to watch. Before long, a large crowd followed behind, even old women in their decades tottered along. In less than two days, all eighty-odd double-wheeled double-furrow plows in the Longzhou Brigade of the Gaoxing Commune were put to use, speeding up the deep plowing by three or four times, ensuring the completion of the task.
    Comrade Shi Feng not only participated in labor but also learned from the masses through labor. This was not only the case in production but also in the welfare work for the commune members. For example, when he heard that the canteen in the Gaoling Brigade of the Gaoxing Commune was not run well, he packed his bedding and quietly went to the canteen of the Third Team; as soon as he entered the door and put down his luggage, he started washing pots, cooking, and preparing dishes with the canteen staff, vying to do all the work. When the commune members returned from work and saw that the person serving them food was actually the County Party Secretary, they immediately composed a folk song:
    "The secretary goes deep into the canteen, the food is cooked sweet and fragrant; who created our happy life? We thank our benefactor, the Communist Party."
    Soon, the canteen was completely renewed. As soon as you entered the canteen, you would see rows of neat tables, clean and tidy, no longer as messy as before; the accounts that had been uncleared for a long time were also posted on the wall in an orderly manner; the commune members had hot meals and dishes every meal, and they were all smiling happily.

    为了兄弟民族
    一天早晨，天色还是灰蒙蒙的一片，人们还没起床，广西都安瑶族自治县县委书记石峰同志（汉族）已经带着一架双铧犁和几个生产队的干部一起下田了。社员见书记要带头使用新式农具，都抢着要去看。不一会，后面跟了一大群人，就连几十岁的老太婆也摇摇摆摆地跟了去。不到两天工夫，高兴公社龙州大队八十多架双轮双铧犁都全部用上了，使深耕速度加快了三、四倍，保证了任务的完成。
    石峰同志不仅参加劳动，而且从劳动中请教群众，不仅在生产中是这样，在社员的生活福利工作上也是这样。如当他听说高兴公社高岭大队的食堂办得不好的时候，便卷起铺盖不声不响地来到了第三队食堂；一进门放下行李，就和食堂服务员一起刷锅、做饭、煮菜，什么工作都抢着干。等社员劳动回来，看见端饭给他们吃的竟是县委书记时，马上编了一首山歌：
    “书记深入到食堂，饭菜做的甜又香；幸福生活谁人造，感谢恩人共产党。”
    不久，这个食堂便焕然一新，只要一进食堂，就会看见一排排整齐的桌子摆在那里，清清洁洁，不再像以前那么乱糟糟的了；长时期算不清的账目，也有条不紊地公布在墙上；社员们每餐都有热饭热菜吃，直乐得个个眉开眼笑。（附图片）
