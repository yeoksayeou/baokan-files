Using Pigs to Nourish Fields: Fertile and Superior Rice Growth
Datong Production Team in Shaowu: One Pig per Mu of Rice Paddy

According to the Fujian Daily, the Datong Rice Production Specialized Team of the Hongcheng Commune in Shaowu County, achieved one pig per mu of rice paddy, applying more than 100 dan of concentrated fertilizer per mu, becoming a red flag team for pig raising and manure accumulation in Fujian Province.

This team has 300 mu of rice paddies and raises 384 pigs (an increase of 90 compared to last year), averaging 1.2 pigs per mu of rice paddy. Because pig raising and manure accumulation are well done, this year each mu of early rice has been fertilized with an average of 108 dan of concentrated fertilizer. The rice seedlings of the whole team are growing vigorously, have already formed ears and are heading, and there are no third-class seedlings in any field. The japonica rice, which accounts for 77.8% of the early rice area, is growing even better due to good and sufficient fertilizer, becoming the best rice seedlings in the county. Since the Datong Rice Production Specialized Team started raising pigs on a large scale, not only has it accumulated more concentrated fertilizer, but it has also saved labor. According to statistics from January to April, the team accumulated more than 32,000 dan of pig manure, urine, and pigpen fertilizer, saving more than 2,100 labor days. Raising more pigs has also increased the income of commune members. Calculated on the basis of half being kept and half being sold, the team can earn more than 7,600 yuan this year.

The Datong Rice Production Specialized Team has always paid attention to raising pigs in pens to accumulate manure, ensuring that there is a pen wherever there are pigs, a pit wherever there is a pen, and a fertilizer shed next to the pit. In this way, the pig manure, urine, and pigpen washing water in the pigsty can be collected without a single drop being lost.

Recently, the Datong team decided to further develop the pig raising industry. Their preliminary plan is to develop 300 pigs raised by commune member households by the end of the year, so that there are more than two pigs per mu of rice paddy, in order to accumulate more concentrated fertilizer and promote a bumper grain harvest.

### 以猪养田　肥优禾好  邵武大同生产队一亩稻田一口猪

    以猪养田　肥优禾好
    邵武大同生产队一亩稻田一口猪
    据福建日报消息　邵武县红城公社大同水稻生产专业队，做到一亩稻田有一头猪，每亩施精肥一百多担，成为福建省养猪积肥的红旗队。
    这个队共有三百亩水稻田，饲养生猪三百八十四头（比去年增加九十头），平均每亩稻田有猪一点二头。由于养猪积肥搞得好，今年每亩早稻平均施用了精肥一百零八担。全队稻苗生长旺盛，已经孕穗抽穗，没有一丘三类苗。占早稻面积77.8％的粳稻，由于肥好肥足，长得更好，成为全县最好的稻苗。大同水稻生产专业队大量养猪以来，不仅精肥积得多，同时也节省了劳力。据1至4月份统计，全队共积三万二千多担猪粪尿、猪栏肥，节省积肥劳力二千一百多个工。多养猪也给社员增加了收入，按一半存栏、一半出卖计算，全队今年就可收入七千六百多元。
    大同水稻生产专业队一直注意圈猪积肥，做到有猪就有圈、有圈就有坑、坑边搭肥棚，每个猪场都有一个可容七十到一百担的蓄肥坑。这样猪栏里的猪粪尿和洗猪栏水就可一滴不漏地收集起来。
    最近，大同队决定进一步发展养猪业，他们初步规划到年底要发展社员家庭养猪三百头，使每亩稻田有二头以上，以增积更多的精肥，促进粮食大丰收。
