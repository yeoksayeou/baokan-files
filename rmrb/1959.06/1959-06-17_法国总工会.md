Small Information

    French General Confederation of Labor
    The French General Confederation of Labor is the largest national progressive trade union organization in France. It was founded in 1895. Its organization is spread throughout the country, with ninety-two provincial federations and more than forty national industrial unions, with 1.6 million members. But its influence far exceeds the scope of its own membership. In factory committee elections, the General Confederation of Labor receives 70% to 85% of the total votes. The leader of the Socialist Party, Léon Jouhaux, carried out three split activities and split off in 1947 to form the "Workers' Force General Confederation." However, the French General Confederation of Labor has always held high the banner of unity. In 1955, the French General Confederation of Labor's congress decided to launch a movement to rebuild a single national union. In 1958, the General Confederation of Labor's National Committee meeting once again suggested to other trade union organizations that they act in unison in strike struggles.
    The General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor is Benoît Frachon. (Collected)

    法国总工会
    法国总工会是法国最大的全国性进步工会组织。成立于1895年。它的组织遍于全国，有九十二个省的联合会和四十多个全国产业工会，会员一百六十万人。但是它的影响远远超出自己会员群众的范围，在选举工厂委员会的投票中，总工会所得票数占总票数的70％到85％。社会党的领导人石乌曾进行三次分裂活动，并于1947年分裂出去成立了“工人力量总工会”。法国总工会却一直高举团结的旗帜。1955年法国总工会的代表大会决定开展重建全国单一工会的运动。1958年，总工会全国委员会会议再次向其他工会组织建议，在罢工斗争中一致行动。
    法国总工会的总书记是贝诺瓦·弗拉商。　（集）
