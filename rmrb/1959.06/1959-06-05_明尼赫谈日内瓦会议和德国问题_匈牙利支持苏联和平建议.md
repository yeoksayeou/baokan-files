Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 4th: Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government Premier Münnich answered several questions posed by a correspondent from the German News Agency (ADN) in Budapest regarding the German question and the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" published Münnich's conversation with the reporter today.

Regarding the West Berlin issue, Münnich emphasized that foreign troops should withdraw from West Berlin, all espionage and provocative activities against the German Democratic Republic or other socialist countries conducted in West Berlin should cease, and West Berlin should become a free city.

Münnich said that the resolution of the German question is directly related to the interests of the Hungarian people, and the Hungarian government and people fully support the peace proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. If the four foreign ministers could accept Ulbricht's invitation to visit the German Democratic Republic, the foreign ministers of the three Western countries would personally witness the free and happy life of the people of the German Democratic Republic.

Münnich refuted U.S. Secretary of State Herter's lies and fallacies at the Geneva Conference, which attempted to deny the existence of West German militarism and slander the German Democratic Republic as a militaristic state. He pointed out that in reality, the West German regime is still controlled by those German monopoly capitalists who assisted the fascists in coming to power in the past. It is well known that former Hitler fascists occupy important positions in the current West German government agencies and army. For example, Grewe, a member of the Bonn government's delegation to the Geneva Conference, is such a person, and many West German fascist organizations are openly promoting West German imperialist revanchist and aggressive ambitions.

Münnich then pointed out that the working class is in power in the German Democratic Republic, and the government of the German Democratic Republic has resolutely implemented all post-war agreements related to crushing fascism and democratic reform. People all over the world know that the government and people of the German Democratic Republic have resolutely struggled to prevent the revival of West German militarism and to achieve the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Münnich emphasized that the participation of the German Democratic Republic in the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is a great diplomatic victory for the entire socialist camp. The delegation of the German Democratic Republic represents the interests of all peace-loving German people at the Geneva Conference, demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the resolution of the West Berlin issue. The actions of the West German delegation are contrary to the interests of the German people, and they are unwilling to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

    明尼赫谈日内瓦会议和德国问题
    匈牙利支持苏联和平建议
    新华社布达佩斯4日电  匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫回答了德意志通讯社驻布达佩斯记者提出的有关德国问题和日内瓦外长会议的一些问题。匈牙利“人民自由报”今天刊登了明尼赫同记者的谈话。
    明尼赫在谈到西柏林问题时强调指出，外国军队应该撤出西柏林，应该停止在西柏林进行的反对德意志民主共和国或其他社会主义国家的各种间谍和挑衅活动，应该使西柏林成为自由城市。
    明尼赫说，德国问题的解决直接关系到匈牙利人民的利益，匈牙利政府和人民完全支持苏联和德意志民主共和国的和平建议。如果四国外长能够接受乌布利希的邀请，到德意志民主共和国去访问，那么三个西方国家的外长将会亲眼看到德意志民主共和国人民自由幸福的生活。
    明尼赫驳斥了美国国务卿赫脱在日内瓦会议上企图否认西德军国主义的存在以及污蔑德意志民主共和国为军国主义国家的谎言和谬论。他指出，在今天，西德的政权事实上仍然是被那些过去协助法西斯上台的德国垄断资本家们所操纵。众所周知，过去的希特勒法西斯分子在现在的西德政府机构和军队中都占居重要职位，例如波恩政府参加日内瓦会议的代表团团员格雷韦就是这样的人物，西德很多法西斯组织在公开地宣扬西德帝国主义的复仇和侵略野心。
    明尼赫接着指出，在德意志民主共和国执政的是工人阶级，德意志民主共和国政府坚决贯彻了有关粉碎法西斯主义和民主改革的一切战后的协议。全世界人民都了解到，德意志民主共和国政府和人民在制止西德军国主义复活以及在和平统一德国方面所进行的坚决斗争。
    明尼赫着重指出，德意志民主共和国参加日内瓦外长会议这件事是整个社会主义阵营外交上的巨大胜利。德意志民主共和国政府代表团在日内瓦会议上代表全体热爱和平的德国人民的利益，要求缔结对德和约和解决西柏林问题。而西德代表团的行为是违背德国人民的利益的，他们不愿意缔结对德和约。
