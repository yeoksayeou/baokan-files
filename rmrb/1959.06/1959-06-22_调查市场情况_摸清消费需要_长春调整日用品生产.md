Changchun City is adopting the approach of grasping both large and small products, large and small industries, existing products and new products, prioritizing tasks according to their importance and urgency, and actively developing the production of daily necessities.

The main measures taken by Changchun City to boost the production of daily necessities are to investigate and study market needs, prioritize tasks according to their importance and urgency, appropriately adjust the layout of the daily necessities industry, and do everything possible to tap the potential of raw materials. The specific practices in adjusting the production of daily necessities are as follows: for original varieties with low production capacity, small output, and urgent market demand, production is appropriately increased to strive to meet the supply. For example, according to a survey, the city needs 350 to 400 bundles of various grid lines and shaft lines every month, but at the beginning of the year, there were only two factories in the city producing them, with a monthly output of just over 100 bundles. Based on this situation, adjustments were made, adding a grid line factory with nine machines and more than thirty technicians, changing from two shifts to three shifts. In May, the output of grid lines had increased to more than 400 bundles. Originally, there were only eight towel-producing machines in the city, with an annual production capacity of only about 40,000 dozens, while the actual demand was about 200,000 dozens. After tapping the potential of existing equipment, 48 indigenous and foreign combined towel machines were refitted, and by the end of the year, 150,000 dozens of various towels can be produced.

For missing products, Changchun City has adopted the approach of actively increasing new products. An initial survey showed that there were more than 180 kinds of daily necessities that the masses universally and urgently needed but were not produced. Now, 165 kinds are being produced locally. For example, the knitted goods industry used to produce only coarse yarn socks, white yarn gloves, towels, flat tape, etc. With the coordination and assistance of the municipal leadership, new products such as undershirts, vests, autumn clothing, autumn trousers, jacquard blankets, children's blankets, and handkerchiefs have been added. From January to May, more than 6,000 jacquard blankets were produced, and more than 3,400 dozens of undershirts and vests were produced in the first quarter alone. Changchun City can also produce soap now, and the daily output has reached more than 1,000 dozens. Production workers are studying how to improve the flaking machine to strive for a monthly output of 50,000 dozens of soap. Many new products such as locks, batteries, flashlights, and pencils have also been added to daily small commodities and small hardware.

From January to May this year, 64 kinds of daily necessities that had been discontinued for some reason resumed production. These include pots, knives, spoons, five-eye needles, thimbles, buttons, baby bottles, various bottles such as wine bottles, cardboard boxes, toothpaste caps, wallets, chalk, abacuses, and ink cartridges.

    调查市场情况　摸清消费需要
    长春调整日用品生产
    本报讯　长春市采取大小产品、大小行业、原有产品和新产品一齐抓的办法，分别轻重缓急，积极发展日用品生产。
    长春市抓日用品生产的主要措施是调查研究市场需要，分别轻重缓急，适当地调整日用品工业布局，千方百计挖掘原料材料潜力。在调整日用品生产方面的具体作法是，对原有品种生产能力低、产量小，又是市场迫切需要的，适当地增加产量，力争满足供应。比如，据调查全市每月需要各种格线、轴线三百五十到四百捆，而年初全市只有两个工厂生产，每月只产一百多捆。根据这个情况进行了调整，增加了一座格线厂，九台机器、三十多名技术工人，由两班生产改为三班生产，5月份格线产量已增加到四百捆以上。原来全市只有八台生产毛巾的机器，年产能力仅达四万打左右，而实际需要量则为二十万打左右。经过挖掘旧有设备潜力，改装了四十八台土洋结合的毛巾机，到年末可生产出十五万打各种毛巾。
    对于缺门产品，长春市采取了积极增加新产品的办法。年初调查，全市有一百八十多种群众普遍迫切需要的日用品没有生产，现在已经有一百六十五种自己生产了。如针织品行业过去只生产粗线袜子、白线手套、毛巾、扁带等，经市领导部门调剂、帮助，增加了汗衫、背心、秋衣、秋裤、提花线毯、童毯、手帕等新产品。1至5月份，生产了提花线毯六千多条，汗衫、背心第一季度就生产了三千四百多打，长春市也能生产香皂了，现在日产量已达一千多打，生产工人正在研究改进碾片机，争取月产五万打香皂。日用小百货、小五金类也增加了锁头、电池、手电筒、铅笔等许多新产品。
    今年1至5月份，还有六十四种由于某些原因停产的日用品恢复了生产。其中有锅、刀、勺、五眼、顶针、钮扣、奶瓶、酒瓶等各种瓶子、纸盒、牙膏盖、钱包、粉笔、算盘、墨盒等。
