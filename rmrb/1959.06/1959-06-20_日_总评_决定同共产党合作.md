    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: Sohyo (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) Chairman Kaoru Ota and Secretary-General Akira Iwai stated at a press conference on the evening of the 16th that the Communist Party is a party aiming at socialism and peace, and is one of our own people, the workers. From this point of view, Sohyo intends to adopt an attitude of cooperating with the Communist Party whenever problems arise in the future.
    This is the first time that this national trade union with more than 3.5 million members has expressed its cooperation with the Communist Party.
    These two trade union leaders also said at a press conference held in Gifu City that as long as the Communist Party moves forward along the path of peaceful revolution, Sohyo will actively carry out joint struggles with it.
    Ota and Iwai also pointed out that the Japan Socialist Party did not achieve the desired results in the recent House of Councillors election because it did not give the capitalist forces the resistance it should have, and because its action program was vague. They also pointed out that the Socialist Party's policy on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is also very ambiguous.
    They said that in order to defend peace and defend the interests of organized workers, farmers, small business owners, and unorganized working people, the Socialist Party should transform itself into a modern class party with the working class as its core.

    日“总评”决定同共产党合作
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会议长太田熏和事务局长岩井章16日晚间在记者招待会上发表谈话说，共产党是以社会主义和和平为目标的政党，并且是工人的自己人。从这个观点出发，今后每当发生问题时，总评议会打算采取同共产党合作的态度。
    这个拥有三百五十多万会员的全国性工会第一次表示同共产党合作。
    这两位工会领袖在岐阜市举行的记者招待会上还说，只要共产党沿着和平革命的道路前进的话，总评议会将积极地同它进行联合斗争。
    太田和岩井还指出，日本社会党不久前在参议院选举中没有获得所期望的结果，是因为它没有给资本主义势力以应有的抵抗，因为它的行动纲领含糊不清。他们并且指出，社会党对修改日美“安全条约”的政策也非常含糊。
    他们说，为了保卫和平和保卫有组织的工人、农民、小企业主和没有组织的劳动人民的利益，社会党应当转变成为以工人阶级为核心的近代的阶级政党。
