	Watering and Insect Control for Apple Trees
	In the main apple-producing areas of Liaoning Province, many fruits of the Hongyu and Wojiin varieties, which mature in summer, are now the size of egg yolks, and autumn fruits have also finished blooming and are beginning to appear. In order to combat drought, prevent insect pests, and strive for a bumper apple harvest, fruit farmers in various places are stepping up watering and insect control for apple trees. Gaiping and Fuxian counties, which account for more than two-thirds of the province's total apple production, are currently focusing on drought resistance for fruit trees. In Fuxian county, more than 20,000 people water fruit trees every day, and areas with severe drought have already watered five to seven times. 60% to 70% of the fruit trees in Gaiping County have been watered.
