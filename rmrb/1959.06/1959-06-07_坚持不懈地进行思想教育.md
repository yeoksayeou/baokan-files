Persistently Conduct Ideological Education
Lei Jianying, Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Gansu Province Yintao Uphill Water Conservancy Project Bureau Committee

The great creation of the people of Gansu—the Yintao Uphill Water Conservancy Project—has been under construction for more than ten months. Thanks to the project bureau party committee relying on the masses and persistently carrying out communist ideological education for the more than 100,000 workers, the project progress has been very rapid. All the workers, in the struggle with the continuous mountains and steep cliffs, have greatly liberated their minds and dared to think about things they did not dare to think about in the past, and dared to do things they did not dare to do in the past. This communist thought and spirit, with the continuous progress of the project, is rising higher day by day.

This kind of thought was not established easily. This is the result of the project bureau party committee turning the process of overcoming the difficulties encountered in the project's progress and criticizing backward thinking into a process of in-depth communist ideological education. Facing this new and huge project, in the process of starting construction, the workers' understanding of whether the plan could be realized and how to realize it was initially inconsistent. In particular, those with conservative ideas, their views and attitudes, formed a clear opposition to the vast majority of workers. For example, the bureau party committee called on all workers to strive to complete the task within two years, while those with conservative ideas said: "Completing the task in two years is an empty slogan, it cannot be realized!" "Each person digging a hundred cubic meters of earth per day is just talk, not action!" This kind of conservative thinking seriously affected the smooth progress of the project. The project bureau party committee, in response to this situation, on the one hand, greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm and conducted education on how the Yintao project could be completed quickly, well, and economically. On the other hand, it organized all the workers to recall the pain of drought, so that everyone understood the beautiful prospects after the completion of the Yintao project, and strengthened everyone's determination to complete this project. At the same time, it quickly spread the victorious news that the Longxi work area first broke through the mark of digging a hundred cubic meters of earth per person per day, and then broke through the marks of two hundred and three hundred cubic meters. This was used to educate all the workers, a hundredfold to encourage everyone's labor enthusiasm. High records of earth excavation appeared everywhere, vividly proving that this project could be accelerated, throwing the conservatives into the clouds, and establishing the idea of completing the Yintao project within two years.

The tunnel problem is an important issue in the entire project. According to the original design, the first phase of the main canal had fifty-three tunnels. The technology for building tunnels is complex, and it requires a large number of steel bars, cement, and machinery. The project bureau party committee repeatedly proposed to change the tunnels into open channels, but the conservatives always said it was impossible. They said: "It is natural to have a few tunnels in such a large project," "Deep cuts of more than seventy meters are rare in the world, and cannot be found in books." In order to solve this problem, the party committee handed it over to the vast number of workers for debate, and launched a rectification movement among cadres and technicians. After a great airing of views, a great debate, everyone believed that "open channels are better than tunnels, deep cuts and detours are better than deep excavations." Faced with the facts, the conservatives had to admit their mistakes, so that all tunnels were changed to open channels. This not only shortened the construction period, and reduced the project cost from 200 million yuan to about 100 million yuan, but also made it possible for this "mountain canal" to be navigable throughout.

In the process of carrying out the technological revolution, the conservatives did not believe that the "rustic" laborers could create, and did not believe that local mechanization could solve the problems on the project. They put forward the slogan: "Either use machinery, or use carrying baskets." In response to this idea, the party led the workers to thoroughly criticize the theory that "technology is out of reach," and mobilized the laborers to create and invent. As a result, relying on the wisdom and hands of the laborers, local mechanization and local automation were realized, and the phenomenon of carrying on backs and shoulders was eliminated. The work efficiency immediately increased several times to dozens of times. The conservatives' "expert line" completely went bankrupt.

For such a large project, it is obvious that the policy of "run by the people with government assistance" must be implemented to solve the problem. However, the "hand-stretchers" who did not believe in the power of the masses believed that the Yintao project could not be run by the masses without the state, and must be "run by the public with people's assistance." In order to overcome the erroneous thinking of the "hand-stretchers," the party led the workers to criticize the waiting mentality, rely on the workers, rely on their own efforts, and break through the technical barrier, the material barrier, the equipment barrier, and the funding barrier.

Through the above practical education, the workers' communist ideological consciousness has been drastically improved, becoming the driving force for the continuous leap forward in work. In order to successfully complete the entire project task, they are not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of dangers, "seizing the dawn, seizing the sunset, seizing sunny days, rushing rainy days," "not stopping until the water reaches the Dongzhi Plateau!" They have contributed infinite wisdom and strength to the Yintao project, and heroes and models are constantly emerging everywhere on the construction site. Everyone completed 340 million cubic meters of the project in only ten months of construction, accounting for about 42.5% of the total number of the first phase of the project.

We have obtained the following basic experiences from the ideological and political work of the Yintao project for more than ten months:

(1) To revolutionize nature, one must first revolutionize thinking. People, whether transforming society or transforming nature, are always a decisive factor. To transform society, one must first transform people's thinking. To revolutionize nature, one must also first revolutionize people's thinking. The Yintao project is arduous and great, and must rely on the masses and self-reliance to complete it. In the case of an extremely lack of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, how to make the workers correctly treat the difficulties and constantly emerging problems, it is even more important to revolutionize thinking. At that time, the thinking of the people participating in Yintao was like this: First, although people's productivity has been liberated from the shackles of the old ownership system before and after the communization, and productivity and thinking have unlimited possibilities for leap-forward development, it cannot be said that productivity and thinking are completely and thoroughly liberated. Second, although the "three winds" and "five airs" in the cadres have been basically defeated through the rectification movement, as the working people of social productivity, the remnants of old ideas, viewpoints, and habits still exist. These things often make them afraid to think and afraid to do. Third, although the great leap forward in 1958 greatly broke superstition, liberated thinking, and created many amazing miracles, the superstitious thoughts of thousands of years have a long history, and it is impossible to completely eradicate them all at once. Under this circumstance, the project bureau party committee believed that in order to make more than 100,000 workers truly become the masters of Yintao, vigorously strengthening communist ideological education was more important than anything else. From the beginning of the project, it took communist thought as the guideline and widely and deeply carried out ideological education movements. The party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead, repeatedly mobilized, and organized all cadres to study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Mao Zedong on communism; organized a propaganda team of thousands of troops and horses to go deep into the masses to widely carry out propaganda on the general line and the Yintao policy, major international and domestic current affairs, and the spirit of the first party congress of the project bureau. In addition, the party committee also made comprehensive summaries of work, explored construction laws, inspected and evaluated work, and rectified the work style of cadres, so that the vast number of workers could contribute unlimited wisdom and strength to the Yintao project in the great struggle to transform nature, laboring without regard to remuneration, constructing without regard to conditions, going wherever the party pointed, and firmly establishing the idea and confidence that "man will conquer nature."

(2) Communist ideological education must be carried out anytime and anywhere. People's thoughts, whether advanced or backward, are constantly developing, but also changing tortuously and repeatedly. Ideological education and ideological struggle cannot be achieved once and for all. Therefore, ideological education and ideological struggle should be carried out non-stop. The Yintao project itself is a thrilling battle for mankind to conquer nature. The project is difficult and complex; the number of participants is large, and all kinds of thoughts rise and fall one after another. Among these thoughts, a large number belong to the category of two lines, but some belong to the category of two roads, which requires constant ideological education and ideological struggle. The bureau party committee adopted the ideological education method of combining large-scale shock movements with regular and meticulous efforts to deal with the thoughts of various periods and various different thoughts. Use a shock movement to solve the main ideological trends and main contradictions of a period, and use regular ideological education to deepen and broaden the scope of ideological education. But whether it is a shock or regular, the purpose is to establish pacesetters, establish opponents, and use advanced figures and advanced deeds with communist style to promote and influence people's thinking to continuously move towards the direction of communism, and solve the problems of advanced and backward, correct and wrong in the workers' thinking. Because the party committees at all levels of the project bureau did this among the workers, they greatly broke the right-leaning conservatism and the idea of being content with being downstream, and greatly established the idea of going all out and striving for the upstream. Under the circumstances of great liberation of thinking, the vast number of workers were in high spirits and high morale. Communist ideas converged into a torrent, pushing the project to leap forward continuously.

(3) Leading cadres must carry out large-scale experimental fields and participate in labor. Because the cadres of the Yintao project carried out large-scale experimental fields, and ate, lived, worked, studied, and entertained with the masses, the cadres were not only the leaders of production, but also ordinary laborers. A new type of equal relationship between people based on communism appeared between the cadres and the laborers. In this way, it not only encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the laborers and improved their awareness, but also understood the problems in production and solved them in a timely manner; at the same time, it also facilitated the discovery of ideological problems, figured out the laws of thought, and carried out ideological education in a timely and purposeful manner. Experience has proved that: Because the cadres carried out large-scale experimental fields and participated in labor, ideological education work was more regular, meticulous, and in-depth than in the past. Wherever this was done, the backward units quickly changed their appearance and joined the ranks of advanced units.

    坚持不懈地进行思想教育
    中共甘肃省引洮上山水利工程局委员会宣传部长　雷健英
    甘肃人民的伟大创举——引洮上山水利工程，开工十个多月以来，由于工程局党委依靠群众，对十余万职工坚持不懈地进行共产主义思想教育，工程进度一直很快。全体职工在和丛山峻岭、悬崖绝壁的斗争中，思想大解放了，敢于想过去不敢想的事，敢于做过去不敢做的事。这种共产主义的思想和精神，随着工程的不断进展，一天比一天高涨起来。
    这种思想，不是轻而易举地树立起来的。这是工程局党委，把克服工程进展中所遇到的困难、批判落后思想的过程，变成深入进行共产主义思想教育过程的结果。面对这一新的巨大的工程，在开工过程中，对能否实现计划以及怎样实现计划，职工们起初的认识是不一致的。特别是保守的人，他们的看法和态度，与广大职工形成了明显的对立。例如局党委号召全体职工争取在两年内完成任务，而有保守思想的人就说：“两年完成任务，那是空号召，不能实现！”“每人每日挖百方土，是说的，不是干的！”这种保守思想严重影响工程的顺利进行，工程局党委针对这一情况，一方面大鼓职工干劲，进行多快好省就能完成引洮工程的教育，一方面组织全体职工回忆干旱的痛苦，使每个人了解引洮工程完成以后的美好远景，坚定大家完成这一工程的意志。同时，又迅速传播陇西工区首先突破每人每日挖土百方的大关，接着又突破了二百方三百方关的胜利消息，教育全体职工，百倍地鼓舞大家的劳动热情，到处出现了挖土方的高额纪录，生动地证明这个工程可以加快速度，把保守者抛到九霄云外，确立了两年内完成引洮工程的思想。
    隧洞问题是整个工程中的一个重要问题。按照原来的设计，总干渠第一期工程有五十三个隧洞。建造隧洞的技术复杂，需要的大批钢筋、水泥和机械。工程局党委一再提出要把隧洞改为明渠，但保守者总是说不行。他们说：“这么大的工程，有几个隧洞是理所当然的”，“七十公尺以上的深劈方，世界上少有，书本上也找不到。”为了解决这个问题，党委把它交给广大职工辩论，在干部和技术人员中展开整风运动。经过大鸣大放大辩论，大家认为“明渠比暗渠好，深劈、绕线比深凿好。保守者在事实面前不得不承认自己的错误，使全部隧洞改成明渠，这不但缩短了工期，使工程造价由二亿元降低到一亿元左右，而且可以使这条“山上运河”全线通航。
    在开展技术革命过程中，保守者不相信“土里土气”的民工能创造，不相信土机械化能解决工程上的问题。他们提出口号：“要不就用机械，要不就用背斗”。党针对这种思想，领导职工彻底批判了“技术高不可攀”论，发动民工人人创造，个个发明。结果，依靠民工的智慧和双手，实现了土机械化、土自动化，消灭了人背肩挑现象。工效立即提高了数倍至数十倍。保守者的“专家路线”彻底破产。
    对于这样大的工程，很明显的必须贯彻“民办公助”的方针才能解决问题，可是不相信群众力量的伸手派，却认为引洮工程国家不来办，群众办不起来，一定要“公办民助”。党为了克服伸手派的错误思想，就领导职工批判了等待思想，依靠职工，自力更生，突破了技术关、材料关、设备关和资金关。
    经过以上的实际教育，职工的共产主义思想觉悟急剧提高，成为推动工作不断跃进的动力。他们为了胜利地完成整个工程任务，不怕困难，不怕艰险，“抢曙光，夺夕阳，抢晴天，赶雨天”，“水不到董志塬不罢休！”为引洮工程贡献出了无穷的智慧和力量，工地到处不断出现英雄和模范。大家在开工只十个月的时间内，就完成了三亿四千万公方的工程，约占第一期工程总数的42.5％。
    我们从十个多月来引洮工程的思想政治工作中，获得了如下几条基本经验：
      （一）要革自然的命，必先革思想的命。人，无论是改造社会或改造自然，始终是一个决定性的因素。要改造社会，必先改造人的思想。要革大自然的命，同样必先革人的思想的命。引洮工程艰巨伟大，必须依靠群众自力更生完成。在人力、物力、财力异常缺乏的情况下，如何使职工正确地对待困难和不断出现的问题，革思想的命就更为重要。当时参加引洮的人的思想是这样：一、虽然人们的生产力在公社化前后已从旧的所有制束缚下解放了出来，生产力和思想有了飞跃发展的无限可能性，但是，不能说生产力和思想就是完全和彻底解放了。二、虽然经过整风运动，干部中的“三风”、“五气”被基本上打垮，但作为社会生产力的劳动人民，旧的思想、观点和习惯残余仍有，这些东西常常使他们不敢想、不敢干。三、虽然经过了1958年大跃进，大大破除了迷信，解放了思想，创造了不少惊人奇迹，但是千百年来的迷信思想，渊源久远，还不可能一下子完全根除。工程局党委在这种情况下，认为要使十余万职工真正成为引洮的主人，大力加强共产主义思想教育比什么都重要，从工程一开始，就以共产主义思想为纲，广泛深入地开展了思想教育运动。各级党委书记挂帅，反复作动员，组织全体干部学习了马克思、恩格斯、列宁和毛主席有关共产主义的著作；组织了千军万马的宣传队伍，深入群众中广泛地进行了总路线和引洮方针、国际国内重大时事和工程局第一次党代表大会精神等宣传。此外，党委并通过全面总结工作，探索施工规律，检查评比工作和整顿干部作风，使广大职工在改造自然的伟大斗争中，劳动不计报酬，施工不讲条件，党指向那里就到那里，充分发挥了人的主观能动性，坚定地树立了“人定胜天”的思想和信心。
    （二）必须随时随地进行共产主义的思想教育。人们的思想，不论先进或落后，是经常发展着的，但也曲折地反复地变化着。思想教育和思想斗争都不可能一劳永逸，因此，思想教育和思想斗争就应该一刻不停地进行。引洮工程本身是一场人类征服自然的惊心动魄的恶战，工程艰巨复杂；参加的人数众多，各种各样的思想此伏彼起，在这些思想中，大量的属于两条路线范畴，但也有的属于两条道路范畴，这就更需要不断地进行思想教育和思想斗争。局党委对待各个不同时期的思想和各种不同的思想，采取大搞突击运动和经常细致相结合的思想教育方法。用突击运动解决一个时期的主要思想倾向和主要矛盾，用经常的思想教育加深加宽思想教育的幅度。但不论是突击或经常，其目的都是树立标兵，树立对立面，用具有共产主义风格的先进人物和先进事例，推动和影响人们的思想向共产主义方向不断迈进，解决职工思想中先进与落后、正确与错误的问题。工程局各级党委由于在职工中是这样做的，大破右倾保守、甘居下游的思想，大立鼓足干劲、力争上游的思想，广大职工在思想大解放的情况下，精神振奋，斗志昂扬，共产主义的思想汇成巨流，推动着工程不断向前飞跃。
      （三）必须领导干部大搞试验田和参加劳动。引洮工程的干部因为大搞试验田，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同娱乐，干部既是生产的领导者，又是普通劳动者，在干部和民工之间出现了新型的共产主义的人与人之间的平等关系。这样，就不仅鼓舞了民工的劳动热情，提高了民工的觉悟，也不仅了解了生产中的问题及时加以解决；同时，也便于发现思想问题，摸清思想规律，及时地有目的地进行思想教育。经验证明：由于干部大搞试验田和参加劳动，思想教育工作比过去经常、细致和深入，凡是这样做了的，落后单位都迅速改变了面貌，跻到先进单位行列中去。
