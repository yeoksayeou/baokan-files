Driving Thousands of Miles, Ensuring Safety Every Day
Jilin Railway Bureau Vehicle Department Achieves Seven Years Without Major Accidents

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Vehicle Department of the Jilin Railway Bureau has eliminated major and serious accidents within its jurisdiction for seven years, from June 1952 to the present, becoming a national advanced unit in preventing accidents in railway vehicle departments. Their experiences were promoted at the recent national railway vehicle department accident prevention conference.
    The most basic experience of the Jilin Railway Bureau Vehicle Department in preventing major vehicle accidents is: implementing the policy of prevention first, focusing on daily maintenance, adhering to strict implementation of various maintenance and repair systems, regularly and comprehensively grasping the technical condition of vehicles, maintaining a certain quality standard for vehicles, treating minor problems, and preventing major problems.
    Most of the lines within the Jilin Railway Bureau's jurisdiction are located in the Changbai Mountains, with large gradients and many curves. In the more than 1,800 kilometers of operating lines, gradients account for 1,652 kilometers, and curves account for 597 kilometers. Most of the transported goods are coal, ore, and timber. These line conditions and cargo conditions have increased the burden of vehicle maintenance and repair work. In order to reduce the possibility of accidents, they have adopted a fundamental approach, promptly grasping the technical condition of vehicles, and taking measures to address the weak links and unfavorable aspects of the vehicle's technical condition, making it less prone to accidents. To do this well, the bureau has adhered to the implementation of various maintenance systems, and each workshop and train repair shop regularly prepares a certain amount of maintenance materials to ensure that the maintenance work can proceed smoothly.
    In preventing accidents, the main method adopted by the bureau is to rely on the masses to analyze and grasp the patterns of accident occurrence and to formulate accident prevention measures in advance. They have established a system for accident reporting and accident research and analysis, and regularly mobilize employees to discover accident precursors and find the root causes of accidents. All relevant personnel are convened for serious analysis and research on general accidents and incidents that nearly caused accidents. For the large number of damaged parts that appear, specialized technicians are also organized to conduct comparison, analysis, and research to find the causes of wear and tear and to explore the patterns of accident occurrence. Based on years of experience, they have discovered many patterns of accident occurrence, such as the changes in the function of vehicle accessories caused by different climatic conditions, resulting in the breakage and loss of accessories; the tendency for wheel loosening and abrasion accidents on different gradients; the tendency for excessive wear and cracking of wheel flanges in areas with many curves; and the tendency for brake beam dropout accidents in areas with many bridges and tunnels.
    In view of the patterns of accident occurrence and the technical condition of vehicles, in addition to strictly implementing the maintenance regulations and acceptance systems promulgated by the Ministry of Railways, the bureau has also formulated many supplementary regulations since 1952, with the continuous improvement of vehicle loading capacity and utilization rate, based on the situation of the bureau. These regulations have played an important role in preventing accidents. (Picture attached)

    行车千万里　天天保安全
    吉林铁路局车辆部门七年没有重大事故
    本报讯　吉林铁路局车辆部门从1952年6月到现在的七年内，在管区内消灭了重大事故和大事故，成为全国铁路车辆部门防止事故的先进单位。最近召开的全国铁路车辆部门防止事故会议上推广了他们的经验。
    吉林铁路局车辆部门杜绝重大车辆事故发生的最基本的经验是：贯彻预防为主的方针，以日常维护为主，坚持严格执行各种维护检修制度，经常全面掌握车辆的技术状态，保持车辆的一定质量标准，治小病，防大病。
    吉林铁路局管区内的线路大部分处于长白山区，坡道大，弯道多，在一千八百多公里的营业线路内，坡道占一千六百五十二公里，弯道占五百九十七公里。运载的货物大部分是煤炭、矿石和木材。这样的线路条件和载货条件，加重了他们的车辆维护检修工作。为了减少事故发生的可能性，他们采取了治本的方法，及时地掌握车辆的技术状态，针对车辆技术状态中的薄弱环节和不良部分，采取措施，使车辆不易发生事故。为了做好这项工作，这个局坚持执行各种检修制度，各个车间和列车检修所都经常准备一定的维修用料，使检修工作能够顺利进行。
    在防止事故的工作中，这个局采取的主要手段是依靠群众，分析和掌握事故发生的规律，预先制订防止事故的措施。建立了事故通报和事故研究、分析的制度，经常发动职工挖掘事故苗头，寻找事故根源。对一般性事故以及险些造成事故的事件，都召集有关人员认真分析研究。对于大量出现的破损零件，还组织专门技术人员进行对比、分析、研究，找出磨损的原因，从中探求事故发生的规律。根据几年来的经验，他们发现了许多事故发生的规律，如不同气候条件使车辆配件作用发生变化而造成配件折损、丢失的规律，不同坡道易使车轮发生松弛、擦伤事故的规律，曲线多的地区容易发生轮缘偏磨和裂纹故障的规律，桥梁隧洞多容易发生制动梁脱落事故的规律。
    针对事故发生的规律和车辆的技术状态，这个局除严格执行铁道部颁布的检修规章和验收制度以外，从1952年以来，随着车辆装载量和利用率的不断提高，又根据本局情况制定了许多补充规章。这些规章对于防止事故起了重要的作用。（附图片）
