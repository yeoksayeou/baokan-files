Xinhua News Agency, Accra, June 14th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Shu reports: On June 12th, President Touré of the Republic of Guinea received a Xinhua News Agency reporter visiting Conakry and spoke to him about the friendly feelings of the African people towards the Chinese people, as well as Guinea's current domestic and foreign policies.

President Touré said, "The people of African countries have infinite sympathy for the Chinese people, I would even say infinite admiration. The people here are closely watching the efforts of the Chinese people."

He continued: "In many ways, our experiences are the same, although our conditions and methods are different, we have many of the same major problems. We have the same aspirations. These many factors unconsciously form a spontaneous tendency of sympathy between the people of African countries and the Chinese people."

He added: "I recall the warm welcome given to the Chinese trade union representatives at the General Union of Black African Workers' conference. This expression itself is completely self-explanatory."

Regarding Guinea's foreign policy, President Touré said, "Our foreign policy is based on active neutralism. We believe that our neutralism is by no means an isolationist principle, a passive attitude," but "a neutralism that serves peace, cooperation between peoples, and upholds the right of peoples to self-determination." He said, "In international affairs, we hope to be a contributing force, a factor promoting harmony. We ask the world for help and support, but also demand full respect for our sovereignty. In fact, we have gained much understanding and friendship. Since independence, we have ratified several trade agreements based on barter. We have very good relations with countries that support this principle. These are relationships we are willing to expand and strengthen."

When talking about Guinea's achievements in consolidating independence and building the national economy since independence, President Touré said, "The consolidation of independence is not only related to the recovery of the national economy, but also to the recovery of administration, society, and culture. Independence is only a means to this recovery. Needless to say, the more we develop, the more consolidated our independence will be."

Touré also mentioned that Guinea wants to reform all the structures inherited from the French colonialists, centering on the interests of the people, because these structures were "formulated based on the concepts and principles of colonial exploitation," and they "do not meet the needs and requirements of Guinea's development." He also said that before reforming the structure, we must first change our mental state, that is, "we must completely abandon the habits in thought and behavior that we inevitably acquired under the humiliation of the colonial system."

Regarding the tasks facing Guinea, President Touré said that first, Guinea will make every effort to consolidate its independence and improve the living conditions of its people. Second, Guinea will continue to fight colonialism, which rules African countries. Third, Guinea will actively participate in activities aimed at strengthening world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, June 15th: Guinea's Minister of Agriculture and Cooperation, Diallo, said in a recent meeting with Xinhua reporters that Guinea's main task in agriculture is to overcome certain abnormalities caused during the French occupation and develop agricultural production.

The minister said that of Guinea's 2.6 million people, approximately 95% are engaged in agriculture. Diallo said that the government's policy is to increase rice production in areas suitable for rice cultivation, especially in the areas along the Niger River.

    几内亚总统谈国家内外政策
    并表达非洲人民对中国人民的友情
    新华社阿克拉14日电　新华社记者王殊报道：几内亚共和国总统杜尔6月12日接见了访问科纳克里的新华社记者，并且向他谈到了非洲人民对中国人民的友好感情以及几内亚当前的国内外政策。
    杜尔总统说，“非洲各国人民对中国人民是怀着无限同情，我甚至可以说是怀着无限敬佩的，这里的人们密切地注视着中国人民的努力。”
    他接着说：“在许多方面，我们的经验是相同的，尽管我们的条件和方法各有不同，但是我们有许多相同的重大问题。我们有相同的愿望。这许许多多的因素，不知不觉地便形成了非洲各国人民和中国人民之间的自发的同情倾向。”
    他又说：“我想起在黑非洲工人总联合会开大会时对中国工会代表的热烈欢迎，这种表示本身是完全说明问题的。”
    关于几内亚的外交政策，杜尔总统说，“我们的外交政策是以积极的中立主义为基础的。我们认为，我们的中立主义绝不是一种孤立原则，一种消极态度”，而是“一种为和平、为人民之间的合作服务的中立主义，是一种拥护人民自决权的中立主义”。他说，“在国际方面，我们希望成为一支有贡献的力量，成为一个促进和谐的因素。我们要求世界的帮助和支持，但也要求完全尊重我们的主权。事实上我们获得许多谅解和友谊。在独立以后，我们批准了好几项以换货为基础的贸易协定。我们和支持这一原则的国家有着非常良好的关系。这是我们愿意扩大和加强的关系。”
    杜尔总统在谈到几内亚独立以来在巩固独立和建设国民经济方面取得的成就时说，“独立的巩固不仅同国家经济的恢复有关，而且同行政、社会和文化的恢复有关。独立只是这种恢复的手段，自不待言，我们愈发展，我们的独立就愈巩固。”
    杜尔还谈到了几内亚要以人民利益为中心来改革从法国殖民者那里继承下来的一切结构，因为这些结构是“根据殖民剥削的观念和原则制订的”，它们“不符合几内亚发展的需要和要求”。他又说，在改革结构之前，必须先改变精神状态，这就是“必须彻底抛弃在殖民制度的屈辱下我们不可避免地沾染上的思想和行为方面的习惯”。
    谈到几内亚面对的任务，杜尔总统说，首先，几内亚将尽一切努力来巩固它的独立，并且提高人民生活条件。其次，几内亚将仍同统治非洲国家的殖民主义进行斗争。第三，几内亚将积极参加目的在于加强世界和平的各项活动。
    据新华社阿克拉15日电　几内亚共和国农业和合作部长迪亚洛在最近接见新华社记者时说，几内亚在农业方面的主要任务是克服某些在法国占领时期所造成的不正常状况，并且发展农业生产。
    这位部长说，在几内亚的二百六十万人口中，大约有95％的人从事农业。迪亚洛说，政府的方针是在适宜于种植大米的地区内，特别是在尼白尔河沿岸地区内，增加大米生产。
