A "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration competition is being widely carried out in postal and telecommunications enterprises across the country. As of the end of May, according to statistics from eight provinces and cities, a total of 849 postal routes and circuits have been organized to participate in the competition. In provinces such as Anhui and Shaanxi, the postal routes and circuits participating in the competition reached 70% and 80% respectively. Recently, the competition is developing towards counties and communes. In Hebei Province, 80% of postal and telecommunications bureaus have formulated competition conditions to participate in the competition. In Anhui Province, 660 postal routes and circuits, from the city to the county to the commune, have launched competitions. In 27 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, the percentage of long-distance calls connected in more than one hour decreased from 27.81% in March to 20.3% in May. The percentage of telephone numbers disconnected due to the telephone bureau's inability to connect decreased from 5.09% to 3.11%. The proportion of central-level newspapers arriving in provinces on the same day, provincial-level newspapers arriving in counties on the same day, and county-level newspapers arriving in communes on the same day has greatly increased.

The "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration competition is based on the characteristics of postal and telecommunications, organizing relevant units and employees on postal routes and circuits into a single competition organization, so that all members of each "dragon" are jointly responsible for the overall effect of communication. After the competition was launched, it effectively eliminated the imbalance and disconnection in the communication process and improved the quality of communication. In order to ensure the smooth flow of trunk line communications, postal and telecommunications departments in various regions have adjusted production and labor organizations, allocating the best machines, lines, the best duty officers and operators to the trunk line circuits between the central government and provinces and between provinces. When long-distance calls from Beijing to Chongqing were particularly busy, postal and telecommunications bureaus in Wuhan, Guiyang and other places took the initiative to give way to circuits to ensure central communication. Many postal and telecommunications employees have left the difficulties to themselves and brought convenience to others, carrying out collaborative activities such as "changing generals on horseback", "visiting relatives and friends", "large leading small", and mutual equipment delivery. In the past, long-distance operators in Huanggang, Echeng, Qichun and other places in Hubei Province often caused disputes on the machine because of scrambling to send outgoing calls. After the competition was launched, Huanggang Bureau operators took the initiative to go to Echeng, Qichun and other places to "visit relatives and friends", exchange opinions, and study operating methods with each other. Due to good cooperation, the utilization rate of the Huanggang to Echeng circuit increased from 27.9% to 65%.

After the launch of the postal transport department's competition, the delivery time of newspapers and letters was shortened. On the Hangzhou to Wenling automobile postal route in Zhejiang, automobiles often failed to arrive at the terminal bureau on time in the past, so Wenling, Linhai, Xianju and other counties often could not see the provincial newspaper on the same day. Now the car arrives at the terminal three hours early, so that three or four counties and cities in eastern Zhejiang can see the provincial newspaper on the same day. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the Chongqing postal and telecommunications department has also strengthened contact with newspaper offices, the Civil Aviation Administration, shipping companies and other units to speed up the delivery of the Party newspaper. The Chongqing Daily generally publishes on time, the transportation unit guarantees timely delivery, and the postal and telecommunications department ensures that the majority of readers can see the newspaper after getting up.

In order to ensure the realization of competition indicators, postal and telecommunications departments in various regions have vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution to enhance communication capabilities. The Changwei Prefectural Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Shandong Province used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture 36 single-channel carrier machines and two three-channel carrier machines. Installing these carrier machines can make one line as effective as two or three, thereby changing the tense situation of the entire prefecture's circuits. The percentage of telephones connected in more than one hour in this prefecture decreased from 50% to 8%, the percentage of telegrams sent out in more than 40 minutes decreased from 30% to 10%, and the state saved 100,000 yuan in investment. In the past, employees of the mechanical room of the Beijing Municipal Telephone Bureau drilled into narrow racks to test telephone mechanical faults, and it took half a month to test 6,000 users. After the universal automatic tester was made, 6,000 users could be tested in one day. After the automatic alarm device was made, the number of obstacles reported by users for maintenance was reduced by 70%, reducing the number of maintenance personnel in the entire room by 70%.

    邮电通信“一条龙”　局局协作保畅通
    本报讯　“一条龙”大协作竞赛运动，正在全国邮电企业普遍开展。到5月底，据八个省市的统计，组织起来参加竞赛的邮路和电路共有八百四十九条。安徽、陕西等省参加竞赛的邮路电路达到70％和80％。最近竞赛正向县和公社发展。河北省80％的邮电局订出了竞赛条件参加竞赛。安徽省从市到县到公社，有六百六十条邮路和电路开展了竞赛。北京、上海、武汉、广州等二十七个城市的长途超过一小时接通的长途电话3月份是27.81％，5月份降低到20.3％，因电话局接不通而退号的电话由5.09％降低到3.11％。中央级报纸当天到省、省级报纸当天到县，县级报纸当天到公社的比重大大提高。
    “一条龙”大协作竞赛是根据邮电通信的特点，把邮路和电路上的有关单位和职工组织到一个竞赛组织中，使每条龙里所有成员共同对通信的全程效果负责。竞赛开展以后，有效地消除了通信过程中的失调和脱节现象，提高了通信质量。各地邮电部门为保证干线通信顺畅，调整了生产组织和劳动组织，把最好的机器、线路，最好的值班长和值机员配备在中央到省和省与省间的干线电路上。北京到重庆长途电话特别繁忙时，武汉、贵阳等地邮电局都主动让出电路，保证中央的通信。许多邮电职工都把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，开展了“走马换将”，“走亲访友”，“以大带小”，互送设备等协作活动。湖北黄冈、鄂城、蕲春等地长途话务员，过去常因为争着发去话，引起机上纠纷。竞赛开展以后，黄冈局话务员主动到鄂城、圻春等地去“走亲访友”，交换意见，互相研究操作方法。由于协作配合得好，黄冈至鄂城的电路利用率由27.9％提高到65％。
    邮政运输部门竞赛开展以后，缩短了报刊和信件的传递时间。浙江杭州至温岭的汽车邮路，过去汽车常常不能准点到达终点局，因而温岭、临海、仙居等县常看不到当天的省报。现在汽车提前三小时到达终点，使浙东三、四个县市每天能看到当日的省报。在党委的领导下，重庆邮电部门还加强了和报社、民航局、轮船公司等单位的联系，以加速党报传递速度，重庆日报在一般情况下做到准时出版，运输单位保证及时运递，邮电部门做到使广大读者能在起床后就看到报纸。
    为了保证竞赛指标的实现，各地邮电部门大闹技术革新和技术革命，增强通信能力。山东昌潍专区邮电局用土洋结合的办法，制造了单路载波机三十六部，三路载波机两部，安上这些载波机，能使一条线路顶两条或三条用，从而改变了全专区电路的紧张局面。这个专区超过一小时接通的电话由50％降低到8％，超过四十分钟发出的电报从30％降低到10％，并为国家节省了十万元投资。北京市内电话局机械室的职工，过去钻在狭窄的机架中测试电话机械故障，半个月才能测试六千个用户，制成万能自动测试器后，一天就能测试六千个用户，制成自动报警装置后，用户通知检修的障碍减少了70％。使全室的维护人员减少了70％。
