On Increasing Production, Quality, and Economy
Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the CPC

A vigorous movement to increase production, improve quality, and practice economy is unfolding throughout our province. This is a movement full of revolutionary spirit. In this movement, our ranks of socialist builders are advancing with firm, steady, and powerful steps, working together to push forward the cause of socialist construction.

Everything is for Doing Our Work Better

The cause we are undertaking is the greatest and most beautiful cause for changing the "poor and blank" face of our country and benefiting the people. Under the guidance of the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction achieved extraordinary accomplishments like those of 1958, marking a successful beginning. Construction is like battle, and on the basis of the rich experience of the first round, the second round should be fought even better. The tactics of battle should be adapted to the time and place. Last year had its tactics, and this year has its tactics. Because of the construction of clusters of iron-smelting furnaces, rows and columns of steel-smelting furnaces, and various factories that have been built or are under construction; also because of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the universal establishment of people's communes in rural areas; and also because of the great development of cultural and educational undertakings and other undertakings, what we need to do now is to manage the newly built and expanded factories better, so that iron-smelting furnaces, steel-smelting furnaces, and all industrial and mining enterprises produce as many high-quality products as possible; to run the people's communes well, so that they produce more grain, cash crops, and raise more poultry; to run the cultural and educational undertakings and other undertakings well, so that they play a greater and better role and achieve greater and better achievements. In short, everything is for doing our work better. This is the tactic for this year's battle, and this is the true meaning of the movement to increase production, improve quality, and practice economy.

Action Slogan for All Industries and All People

It absolutely cannot be said that increasing production, improving quality, and practicing economy are only matters for the iron and steel industry or only for the industrial front. It should be a matter for all industries such as workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and for all levels of organs. The quality of steel must be improved, and the quality of textiles and clothing should also be better; the land must be planted more and planted well, and buying and selling must also be done well; the quality of teachers' teaching must be improved, and students must also study better; the style of work of the organs must be improved, the efficiency of work must be improved, and people who write articles must write articles that are even more enjoyable to read. Therefore, from the perspective of the requirements of the movement to increase production, improve quality, and practice economy and its slogan, and the spirit it embodies, it should become the action and slogan of all industries, all units, and all people, and each should take action according to the specific circumstances of their industry, unit, and individual.

Chairman Mao told us that we must comprehensively and correctly determine the focus and order of our work in accordance with the historical and environmental conditions of each specific region. Carrying out the movement to increase production, improve quality, and practice economy is the central link that we must firmly grasp in order to advance the cause of socialist construction. If we grasp this link and resolutely implement it, the entire cause will develop greatly.

The fact that we must compact when building a large dam also makes us think of another major significance of the movement to increase production, improve quality, and practice economy, that is, it is not only for today's construction, but more importantly, it is also for tomorrow's construction. People know that building a dam should never only add soil without compacting it, or only compact it without adding soil. It should be adding soil on one side and compacting it on the other, and the soil should be compacted as it is added. In this way, a dam is built. This is like what we often say, the development and movement of things are not linear, like the rolling Yangtze River, it advances in waves. Consolidating the already greatly developed cause is not only another form of the leap forward in the construction cause, but also prepares for a greater leap forward next year. Therefore, we say that the significance of the movement to increase production, improve quality, and practice economy is positive and full of revolutionary enterprising spirit.

Doing everything better and better is a requirement, a serious task shared by everyone, and a complex contradiction before us. In different regions, in different industries, and under existing equipment, raw materials, materials, technology, and other conditions, it is naturally not a simple matter to have high quality, increase production, and save money. However, the practice of many production units and many workers proves that this is entirely possible and can be done very well.

In a Sense, the Dominant Aspect of the Contradiction Between Quantity and Quality is Quality

Regarding the requirements for the quantity and quality of production, some comrades believe that they can be separated and only grasp the quantity. They say, "If you take care of this, you can't take care of that. To increase production and complete the task, you can only grasp the quantity." Although this idea stems from completing the task, because this way of doing things does not conform to the objective law of the unity of the contradiction between quantity and quality, the result often causes a waste of wealth. Please see, all enterprises that have achieved both quantity and quality, taking practical results as the standard, have truly completed their tasks well. Otherwise, it is not good enough. Production cannot rely on only one leg of quantity, nor can it be imagined to walk on one and a half legs. We should seek quality from quantity and seek quantity from quality, and achieve both quantity and quality. At present, generally speaking, we should first pay attention to improving quality. If the land is planted well, more grain will be harvested; no matter how many hundreds or thousands of machines of poor quality are produced, they cannot be started and cannot be compared with a machine of good quality. In this sense, the dominant aspect of the contradiction between quantity and quality is quality rather than quantity, and improving quality also improves quantity. That is to say, without quality, there is no quantity. Then, can we absolutize the improvement of quality, leaving aside the comprehensive requirements of high yield, speed, and economy? No, we should not understand the requirement of improving quality as sacrificing the total output to pursue high quality, high standards, and high yield for one product, one project, or one experimental field. We should reach as much as possible and as much as we should under possible conditions; we should do as well as possible and as well as we should, truly being more and better. Of course, there are also situations where it is difficult to achieve both more and better under existing conditions, so we should "rather have less, but better." For example, the production of iron should be like this: on the basis of constantly striving to improve technology, produce as much good iron as possible. We must avoid wasting manpower, raw materials, and transportation capacity, and produce bad iron that cannot be refined into good steel.

In the movement to increase production, improve quality, and practice economy, quality is the central link, and economy is an indispensable condition. We must strive to increase production on the premise of improving quality and on the basis of economy. The three are interrelated, inseparable, and indispensable. This is an important law of the development of the construction cause. The clear reflection of this law is the Party's general line for building socialism. Some comrades believe that it is difficult to save money, improve quality, and achieve high production. Yes, there are difficulties, but it is not impossible to do it. The question is how to view economy and how to implement economy.

Saving Money Will Accelerate Construction, Wasting Will Delay Construction

The significance of saving money is often talked about by everyone. But in a large country like ours with a large population and such a large-scale socialist construction, if each person and each production unit saves or spends more and wastes one yuan, one catty of meat, one foot of cloth, one kilogram of material, what kind of number will this be in relation to the development of the construction cause? It should be said that many people have not deeply realized its significance. Saving money will accelerate construction, and wasting will delay construction. The problem is so obvious. Saving money requires us to learn how to live, further improve the operation and management of enterprises; requires us to learn how to calculate accounts, further strengthen economic accounting; requires us to improve technology and tap the potential in all aspects. In short, it requires us to make the best use of people and materials in construction, especially to use them properly. "Using steel on the cutting edge," that is saving money. Some people think that they can save money by reducing the quality of products, but this is not feasible. In many cases, such "savings" will cause great losses and waste. We should ensure the quality of products under the conditions where it is possible to save money, and, as much as possible, constantly improve the quality of products.

To Make the Movement to Increase Production, Improve Quality, and Save Money Achieve Solid Results, We Must Do a Good Job in Three Aspects

According to the experience in the short period since the launch of the movement to increase production, improve quality, and save money, if the following three aspects of work are done well, the movement will be carried out vigorously, steadily, and achieve solid results. These three aspects of work are: in-depth and meticulous ideological work, actively carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, and meticulous and strict management work. Experience has proved that when as many people as possible fully understand the profound significance of the movement, the movement will develop in a lively and creative form. Difficulties cannot stop us from moving forward, they will prompt us to better carry out construction with a fighting spirit. The masses can easily understand this principle. Therefore, we must encourage everyone to overcome difficulties, whether it is the temporary difficulty in the supply of raw materials, technology, equipment, or the supply of certain daily necessities, it should not affect our revolutionary enthusiasm in the slightest. We must encourage everyone to turn every specific difficulty into a good thing, further develop the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work, and strive to improve technology and carry out technological innovation in accordance with the principle of combining revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit. We must know that the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution is built on the basis of people's desire to break free from the limitations of objective conditions. At the same time, as mentioned earlier, in order to ensure the normal progress of production, we must also attach great importance to quickly restoring, establishing, and improving the various management systems of enterprises, especially the inspection system and responsibility system for quality. As the saying goes: "With rules, there can be squares and circles." With good management system, there will be good production.

The movement to increase production, improve quality, and practice economy is a great school. In this movement, on the basis of the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we must further learn to better implement the mass line in carrying out socialist construction. We will better implement the following series of two-pronged policies in this year's work: that is, industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, central industry and local industry, production and exchange, politics in command and material interests, etc., so as to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results on the basis of comprehensive balance and proportionate development. The problem now is to be good at learning, learning from good experiences, and also learning from shortcomings. Learning from both aspects is the way to learn well. In fact, every step forward in our cause, the process of our great achievements and overcoming those inevitable shortcomings, is the process of the socialist builders growing and becoming proficient.

We have sufficient conditions to promote the leap forward of the socialist construction cause in 1959 through the movement to increase production, improve quality, and practice economy. These conditions are the Party's strong, great, and correct leadership; the masses' determination to change the poor and blank face of our country; and the rich experience that cadres and the masses have gained in comprehensively and completely implementing the general line since the Great Leap Forward last year. As long as we are good at relying on and using these conditions, we will surely achieve great achievements in this year's construction, and we will surely lay a solid foundation for greater victories next year.

    谈增产、优质、节约
    中共河北省委第一书记　林铁
    在我们全省范围内，正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的增产、优质、节约运动。这是一个充满革命精神的运动。在这个运动中，我们的社会主义建设者的队伍迈着坚定、踏实、有力的步伐，正在齐心协力地把社会主义建设事业推向前进。
    一切为着把我们的事业办得更好一些
    我们所干的事业，是为了改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，为人民造福的最伟大、最美好的事业。在党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的指引下，社会主义建设的大跃进，旗开得胜，取得了1958年那样不平凡的成就。建设如同战斗，在第一个回合的丰富经验的基础上，第二个回合也应该打得更好。仗的打法要因时因地制宜。去年有去年的打法，今年有今年的打法。由于成群的炼铁炉，成行成列的炼钢炉，这样或那样的工厂建设起来了，或者正在建设；还由于随着农业生产的大跃进，农村普遍建立了人民公社；也还由于文化教育事业和其他各项事业都有了很大的发展。所以，我们当前要做的事，就是要把新建的、扩建的工厂管理得更好，让炼铁炉、炼钢炉和所有工矿企业，生产出尽可能多的质量优良的产品；把人民公社办好，让它生产出更多的粮食、经济作物和饲养更多的家禽；把文化教育事业和其他各项事业办好，让它们发挥更大更好的作用，取得更大更好的成就。总之，一切为着把我们的事业办得更好一些。这就是今年一仗的打法，这就是增产、优质、节约运动真正的意义所在。
    所有行业所有人的行动口号
    切不可以说，增产、优质、节约只是钢铁工业或者只是工业战线上的事。它应该是工、农、商、学、兵等各行各业和各级一切机关的事。钢铁质量要提高，纺织、缝衣的质量也应该更好；地必须多种、种好，买卖也要做好；教师教学的质量要提高，学生也要学习得更好；机关工作的作风要改善，办事的效率要提高，写文章的人也要把文章写得越发令人爱读。因此，从增产、优质、节约运动及其口号的要求和它所体现的精神来说，它应该成为一切行业、一切单位和所有人的行动和口号，并且各自按照本行业、本单位、本人的具体情况行动起来。
    毛主席告诉我们，要依照每一具体地区的历史条件和环境条件，统筹全面，正确的决定我们的工作重心和工作秩序。开展增产、优质、节约运动，是目前我们推进社会主义建设事业必须紧紧抓住的中心环节。抓住了这个环节，并且坚决地贯彻下去，整个事业就大大向前发展了。
    从修筑一条大坝必须夯实这件事，也使我们想到增产、优质、节约运动的又一个重大意义，就是它不仅仅是为着今天的建设，更重要的，同时是为着明天的建设。人们知道，修筑大坝，绝不应该只加土不夯实，或者只夯实不加土。应该是一面加土，一面夯实，加了土就要夯实。就这样，一条大坝修筑起来了。这有如我们常说的，事物的发展、运动不是直线的，好像长江大水滚滚来，是波浪式地前进的。把已经大发展起来的事业夯实，不仅是建设事业跃进的另一种形式，也是为明年的更大跃进做了准备。因此，我们说增产、优质、节约运动的意义是积极的，是充满着革命的进取精神的。
    把一切事业办的好些、再好些，是一种要求，是大家共同肩负的严重任务，也是摆在我们面前的一个复杂的矛盾。在不同地区，在不同行业，在现有设备、原料、材料、技术等条件下，要优质，又要增产，还要节约，这自然不是简单的事。但是，许多生产单位、许多工人的实践证明，这是完全能够做到的，而且能够做得很好。
    从某种意义上说，数量质量矛盾的主导方面是质量
    对于生产的数量和质量要求，有些同志以为可以拆了开来，只抓住数量。说“顾了这头，顾不了那头。要增产、要完成任务，只好抓数量。”虽然这种想法是出于为了完成任务，但是由于这种干法不符合数量质量矛盾统一的客观规律，结果常常造成对于财富的浪费。请看，凡属做到了数量、质量两条腿走路的企业，以实效为标准，它的任务就真正完成得好。反之，就不够好。生产不可以只靠数量这一条腿走路，也不能设想用一条半腿走路，应该从数量中求质量，从质量中求数量，作到数量、质量并举。当前，就一般情况说，应该首先注意提高质量。地种得好，粮食就打得多；质量坏的机器尽管生产了成百台成千台，却开动不得，就没法和一台质量好的机器相比。从这个意义上说，数量质量矛盾的主导方面是质量而不是数量，提高了质量也就提高了数量。也就是说，没有质量也就没有数量。那么，可不可以把提高质量绝对化起来，离开了高产，离开了多快好省的全面要求？不，不应该把提高质量的要求理解为用牺牲总产量去追求一件产品、一项工程、一块试验田的高质量、高标准、高产量。应该是在可能条件下，能够和应该达到多么多，就达到多么多；能够和应该做到多么好，就做到多么好，真正是又多又好。当然也有这样的情况，在现有条件下，当难以作到又多又好的时候，就应该“宁肯少些，但要好些”。例如，铁的生产就应该这样：在不断地努力提高技术的基础上，能生产多少好铁，就生产多少好铁。要避免浪费人力、原料和运输力，生产那些不能炼成好钢的坏铁。
    在增产、优质、节约运动中，优质是中心环节，节约是必不可少的条件，要在提高质量的前提下和节约的基础上，力求增产。这三者是相互联系的，不能分割，缺一不可。这是建设事业发展的一条重要规律。这个规律的鲜明反映，就是党的建设社会主义的总路线。有些同志认为既要节约又要优质、高产，是困难的。是的，困难是有的，但是，并不是不能做到的。问题在于怎样看待节约和怎样实行节约。
    节约会加速建设，浪费会延缓建设
    节约的意义，是大家常谈的。但是像我们这样人口众多的大国和如此大规模的社会主义建设，每一个人，每一个生产单位节省了或者多用和浪费了一元钱，一斤肉，一尺布，一公斤材料，这将是一个关系建设事业发展的怎样的数字？应该说，许多人并不是都深刻体会到了它的意义。节约会加速建设，浪费会延缓建设，问题就是这样明摆着的。节约，就是要求我们学会过日子，进一步改善企业的经营管理；要求我们学会算账，进一步加强经济核算；要求我们提高技术，挖掘各个方面的潜力。总之，要求我们在建设中作到人尽其才，物尽其用，特别是用之得当。“把钢使在刀刃上”，这就是节约。有人以为可以用降低产品质量的办法达到节约，这是行不通的。在许多情况下，这样的“节约”会造成很大的损失和浪费。应该在可能节约的条件下，保证产品应有的质量，并且，要尽可能不断地提高产品的质量。
    要使增产优质节约稳收实效，必须作好三方面的工作
    根据增产、优质、节约运动开展以来短短时间内的经验，以下三个方面的工作做得好，运动就开展得既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实，稳收实效。这三个方面的工作是：深入细致的思想工作，积极地进行技术革新和技术革命，周密、严格的管理工作。经验证明，当尽可能多的人充分了解了运动的深刻意义，运动就会以生动活泼而又充满创造精神的形式发展。困难阻止不了我们前进，它会促使我们以战斗的精神更好地进行建设。群众是容易了解这个道理的。所以，要鼓起大家克服困难的干劲，不论是原材料供应的，或者是技术、设备的，或者是某项生活用品供应上的暂时困难，都不能丝毫影响我们的革命干劲。要鼓舞大家把每一项具体的困难变为好事，进一步发挥苦干、实干、巧干的精神，根据革命热情和科学精神相结合的原则，努力提高技术，大搞技术革新。要知道，技术革新和技术革命运动就是建筑在人们要求从客观条件的限制中解脱出来的基础上的。同时如前面所说，为了保证生产的正常进行，也必须十分重视迅速恢复、建立和健全企业的各项管理制度的问题，特别是关于质量的检查制和责任制。常言说的好：有规矩才能成方圆。有好的管理制度，才会有好的生产。
    增产、优质、节约运动是一个伟大的学校。我们要在这个运动中，在1958年大跃进经验的基础上，进一步学会在进行社会主义建设中更好地贯彻执行群众路线的方针。我们对于下述一系列两条腿走路的方针：即工业和农业、重工业和轻工业、中央工业和地方工业、生产和交换、政治挂帅和物质利益等等，必将在今年的工作中贯彻执行得更好，在综合平衡、按比例发展的基础上作到多快好省。现在的问题是要善于学习，从好的经验中学习，也从缺点中吸取教训。从两个方面学习才学得好。实际上，我们的事业每前进一步，我们取得巨大成就和克服那些难免的缺点的过程，就是社会主义建设者的队伍成长、熟练的过程。
    我们有充分的条件通过增产、优质、节约运动促进1959年社会主义建设事业的跃进。这些条件就是党的坚强、伟大、正确的领导；广大群众决心改变我国一穷二白面貌的雄心大志；以及干部和群众在去年大跃进以来，对于全面地、完整地贯彻执行总路线，已经取得了丰富的经验。只要我们善于依靠和运用这些条件，我们就一定会取得今年建设的巨大成就，就一定会为明年的更大胜利打下坚实的基础。
