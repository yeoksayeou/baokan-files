Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: Jilin Province vigorously rushed to plant abandoned land and wasteland in the later stage of spring plowing. By the end of May, the province had expanded the cultivated area of ​​grain and oil crops by more than 1.8 million mu.

In the rush to plant abandoned land, various regions conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, striving to increase yield per unit area. The Second Production Team of the Sanjiazi Management Area of ​​the Wulihe Commune in Yongji County implemented a system of "four to the fields" for crops, targets, measures, and labor remuneration. When the commune members rushed to plant wasteland, they carefully selected seeds and implemented reasonable close planting and meticulous land preparation. The Huangnihezi People's Commune in Dongfeng County criticized the idea that "picking land to plant is an extra gain, and no fertilizer is needed," and fertilized all 1,470 mu of land that had been additionally planted.

In field management, people's communes in various places also treated the land planted "equally." The Shuangliao County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all people's communes to manage the originally planned sown land well, and also to manage the additionally planted land as much as possible. Therefore, the communes promptly cultivated, hoed, topdressed, checked seedlings, and replanted seedlings on the selected land. They also watered some of the dry land.

    吉林  精心种荒地  争取多收粮
    据新华社长春讯  吉林省在春耕后期大力抢种废耕土地和撩荒地。到5月底，全省已扩大粮食和油料作物的耕地面积一百八十多万亩。
    各地在抢种废耕地中，认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，力争提高单位面积产量。永吉县五里河公社三家子管理区第二生产队，实行了作物、指标、措施和劳动报酬“四到田”的制度，社员们在抢种撩荒地时都精选了种子，实行了合理密植和细致整地。东丰县黄泥河子人民公社批判了“拣地种是外捞，不上粪也可以”的想法，将多种的一千四百七十亩地全部施了肥。
    在田间管理上，各地人民公社对拣种的土地也“一视同仁”。中共双辽县委指示各人民公社，在管理好原计划播种的土地同时，对拣种的土地也要尽力管理好。因此，各公社对拣种的土地都及时铲趟、追肥、查苗、补苗，还在一部分干旱土地里浇了水。
