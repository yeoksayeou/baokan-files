Everything Must Follow the Mass Line
    Ju'nan County Committee Calls on All County Cadres to Learn from Sun Chengyun, Wei Jiali, and Li Yongqian

    (Reported by our newspaper) In order to further promote the transformation of work style among cadres at all levels and ensure the realization of this year's new leap forward tasks, the Ju'nan County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shandong Province called on cadres at all levels throughout the county to conscientiously study the mass line work methods of comrades Sun Chengyun, Wei Jiali, Li Yongqian, and others.
    Sun Chengyun, the Party Secretary of the Dashan People's Commune, adhered to the mass line in all his work. Whether it was deep plowing, terrace construction, afforestation, or mountain clearing, he would always discuss and consult with the masses and proceed only after obtaining the consent of the majority. For example, last year, when promoting the rational close planting of sweet potatoes, some people with conservative ideas were resistant. In the past, the sweet potato ridges built with a four-share plow could only plant 2,000 seedlings per mu; now, the requirement was to increase this to more than 3,000 seedlings, and some people complained that it was too dense. At this time, he himself was not sure how to plant so densely, so he went deep into villages such as Damoudun and Zhulu to hold discussions with production team leaders and veteran farmers to study and analyze the growth characteristics of the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato and discuss ways to improve the ridging method. He and the plowman worked together in the field, measuring out a section of land with a ruler and repeatedly experimenting, finally creating a "double ditch" sweet potato ridging method that combined layered fertilization. The small, flat ridges raised with this method were equally wide at the top and bottom, and the same land area could increase the number of ridges by one-third, planting about 4,000 seedlings per mu without appearing too dense. At the same time, because the bottom soil layer was deepened and the height of the ridges exposed above ground was reduced, it was conducive to sweet potato growth; it also saved water when irrigating. Everyone agreed that this method was good and quickly promoted it. Last year, the entire commune planted 25,000 mu of sweet potatoes using the "double ditch" ridging method, generally increasing production by 30% compared to the old method.
    Comrade Wei Jiali is the Party Branch Secretary of the Caoling Production Brigade of the Wending People's Commune. In his work, in addition to regularly holding old peasant forums and small forums for people from all walks of life to connect with the masses, he also took advantage of production gaps to frequently visit commune members' homes. Once, Wei Jiali visited the home of poor peasant Chen Zhenglian and learned from their conversation that he was experiencing financial difficulties. He brought this up at the branch committee meeting, and they helped him solve the problem. After that, Chen Zhenglian's enthusiasm for production became even greater, and he became an activist who loved the commune like his home and worked diligently. When Wei Jiali was the director of the original Red Star Commune, he personally visited more than 500 of the commune's 623 households, and he was very familiar with the commune members' thoughts, production, and living conditions.
    Comrade Li Yongqian is the famous captain of the Steel Sixth Team of the Dashan People's Commune, a man of strong will and skillful leadership. He was once a pioneer in the original Dashan Commune's efforts to open mountains, clear ridges, and fill rivers in the fight against nature. This spring, during the major battle to irrigate wheat during the greening stage, the commune Party committee required a universal irrigation every five days. The Steel Sixth Team contracted 280 mu of high-yield wheat fields this year. During the greening irrigation, the entire team set up 22 waterwheels and engaged in the battle in a tense manner, but in one day, they only irrigated less than 20 mu. At this rate, it would take at least fifteen days to complete one irrigation, which was obviously far from the requirements of the Party committee. That evening, he held a forum with technicians, production team leaders, and farmers to discuss solutions. At that time, Li Shoufu said, "No matter how fast the waterwheels turn, we can't complete the task within the time required by the Party committee. I think the problem would be solved if we blocked the Hou River, stored the water, and used gravity irrigation." As soon as Li Shoufu finished speaking, someone objected, saying, "Let's think of other ways. Last year, we used the strength of six or seven teams to dig ditches, but we didn't get the water. Why bother to put in that effort again!" That night, Li Yongqian lay on the kang, recalling one by one the opinions put forward by the team members. In the end, he believed that the only solution was to implement gravity irrigation. Before dawn the next day, he called Li Shoufu to take the instruments and go down to the North River. They finally found the level line and led 47 team members to work hard for most of the day to dig the channel. The river water was guided by them to make more than 40 turns, climb over two dry rivers, and cross two villages to flow into the wheat fields. As a result, not only did the Steel Sixth Team complete the irrigation of its 280 mu of wheat in four days, but also, using this diverted river water, more than 2,000 mu of wheat fields around Lijiazhai Qian and Southeast Ridge were turned into gravity-irrigated fields. The production brigade calculated that each irrigation using this channel saved the entire brigade more than 9,000 workdays.
    The Ju'nan County Committee also stipulated that every Party member cadre from the county committee to the team branch should conscientiously study Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre ideology and work methods, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party," and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on revising the Party Constitution, as well as the "Ten Rules for Party Members and Cadres of Rural People's Communes" issued by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee. While studying the above documents, they should study the specific mass line work methods of comrades Sun Chengyun, Wei Jiali, and Li Yongqian. Through study, they should improve their thinking, compare themselves, and find out the experiences and lessons in their work. In the current practical work, they should continue to implement and promote the system of cadres participating in labor, planting experimental fields, and eating, living, and working with the masses, and they should consult with the masses on everything. The county is required to produce more cadres like Sun Chengyun, Wei Jiali, and Li Yongqian. It was also decided that while regularly carrying out production appraisals and inspections, the work style of cadres at all levels should be appraised and inspected, and cadres who implement the mass line well should be commended in a timely manner, while cadres who implement it poorly or badly should be educated and criticized.

### 事事都要走群众路线  莒南县委号召全县干部学习孙成运、魏家理、厉永谦

    事事都要走群众路线
    莒南县委号召全县干部学习孙成运、魏家理、厉永谦
    本报讯　中共山东莒南县委为了进一步促进各级干部转变作风，保证实现今年新的跃进任务，号召全县各级干部认真学习孙成运、魏家理、厉永谦等同志的群众路线的工作方法。
    大山人民公社党委书记孙成运同志，在工作中，事事走群众路线，不论是进行深翻地、修梯田、封山造林、开山劈岭，还是改进耕作制度，推行合理密植，都是同群众研究商量，并取得大多数群众的同意以后才办。如去年在推行甘薯合理密植时，有些有保守思想的人就不通。过去这个社用扶耕四犁筑成的甘薯垅，每亩只能种二千棵；现在要求增加到三千棵以上，有的人反映太密。这时他自己对如何密植也没有把握，于是便深入到大茅墩、朱芦等村找生产小队长、老农等开座谈会，研究分析“胜利百号”甘薯生长的特性，商讨改进扶垅法。他和扶犁手一起在田间用尺子量出一段地，反复进行操作试验，终于创造出“双开沟”结合分层施肥的甘薯扶垅法。用这种办法扶起的小平垅，上下宽窄相同，同样土地可增加三分之一的垅沟，每亩种四千棵左右，并不显得过密，同时由于垅底土层加深，露出地面的垅高度减低，利于甘薯生长；浇水时还可节约用水。大家一致认为这个办法好，便很快地推广了。全社去年用
  “双开沟”扶垅法，种植的甘薯就达到了二万五千亩，一般比旧法扶垅增产30％。
    魏家理同志是文町人民公社草岭生产大队总支书记。他在工作中除了定期召开老农座谈会和各阶层群众的小型座谈会联系群众以外，还利用生产空隙，经常地到社员家里访问。有一次魏家理到贫农陈正连家里访问，从谈心中了解到他生活有困难，就提到支委会上作了研究，帮助他解决了问题。此后，陈正连的生产劲头更足了，成了爱社如家、勤劳生产的积极分子。魏家理在担任原红星社主任的时候，全社六百二十三户，他亲自登门访问过的就有五百多户，他对社员的思想、生产、生活状况都非常熟悉。
    厉永谦同志是大山人民公社有名的钢六队队长，是一个意志坚强和领导有方的人。他曾经是原大山社开山劈岭、移河填沟等向大自然开展斗争的开路先锋。今春大战小麦返青关中，社党委要求五天普浇一遍返青水。钢六队今年包种了二百八十亩小麦高额丰产田，在浇返青水时，全队架起二十二部水车，紧张地投入了战斗，结果一天的时间才浇了不足二十亩。照这样的速度，浇完一遍水，起码需要十五天，这与党委提出的要求显然相差太远了。晚上，他就召开技术员、生产小组长和农民座谈会研究办法。当时厉守福说：“水车转的再快，也无法按党委要求的时间完成任务，我看把后河拦蓄水引来自流灌溉，问题就解决了。”厉守福刚落话音，就有人提出反对说：“还是想个别的办法吧，去年拿出六、七个队的力量挖渠都没把水引来，何必再去费这工夫！”晚上，厉永谦躺在炕上，把队员们提出的意见，一个一个地回想了一遍，最后他认为唯一的办法还是搞引水自流灌溉。第二天天还不亮，他就叫厉守福拿着仪器，下了北河。他们终于找出了水平线，带领四十七名队员苦干了大半天就把渠道挖成了。河水被他们牵着鼻子拐了四十多个弯，爬过两道干河、越过两个村庄，流到了麦田。这一来，不仅钢六队的二百八十亩小麦四天浇完了一遍水，而且运用这股引来的河水，使厉家寨前、东南岭周围等两千多亩麦田，变成了自流灌溉田。生产大队计算了一下，用这道水渠每浇一次水，可为全大队节约九千多个劳动日。
    莒南县委还规定：从县委到队支部的每个党员干部，都要认真学习毛主席的有关干部思想作风与工作方法方面的指示，刘少奇同志的“论党”和邓小平同志关于修改党章的报告和中共山东省委、省人委“关于农村人民公社党员、干部十项守则的规定”。在学习以上文件的同时，研究和学习孙成运、魏家理、厉永谦三位同志具体走群众路线的工作方法。通过学习提高思想，对照检查自己，找出工作中的经验和教训。在当前实际工作中，要继续实行和发扬干部参加劳动、种试验田、与群众同吃同住同劳动等制度，凡事要同群众商量。要求全县出现更多的孙成运、魏家理和厉永谦式的干部。并决定在定期开展生产评比检查的同时，评比检查各级干部的工作作风，对执行群众路线好的干部要及时表扬，对执行差的和不好的干部要教育和批评。
