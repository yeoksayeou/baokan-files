    Fighting Disease

        Lowering Body Temperature Can Prolong "Clinical Death"

    The end of breathing and the cessation of heartbeat do not signify true death. This phenomenon is known in medicine as "clinical death." During this time, a small amount of metabolism is still maintained in the body. True death usually occurs a few minutes later. In the brief period before true death, life can still be reclaimed. However, the duration of "clinical death" typically lasts only five to six minutes because the cerebral cortex deteriorates easily. The cerebral cortex can only survive for five to six minutes after the heartbeat stops before it begins to break down. If the brain is damaged, it becomes difficult to restore life to the body. Therefore, the longer the duration of "clinical death," the greater the hope of resuscitation. Extending the duration of clinical death is of significant importance in medicine and is a crucial problem that Soviet scientists are striving to solve.

    In the Organism Resuscitation Laboratory led by Professor Legovsky of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, experiments are being conducted to prolong the duration of "clinical death" by lowering body temperature. Multiple experiments on dogs have shown that if hypothermia is induced in dogs that die from excessive blood loss, their clinical "death" time can be extended from five or six minutes to half an hour or even an hour. As a result of inducing hypothermia, the laboratory has successfully performed experiments resulting in complete and lasting restoration of the entire body's life, including the cerebral cortex, approximately one hour after clinical death.

            A Window for the Heart

    Afanasyev, a young surgeon at the hospital affiliated with the Soviet National Economic Exhibition, has solved a very important problem.

    As people age, their bodies gradually weaken. Due to hardening of the arteries, the heart's blood supply becomes difficult. The heart weakens significantly, becoming unable to handle the necessary burden on the body, frequently causing pain and vascular obstruction.

    How can we help the heart bear the heavy burden? Renowned Soviet doctor Reinberg has proposed a new theory.

    The problem lies in a negative pressure inside the pericardium. The heart expends 25% to 40% of its capacity overcoming this pressure. If the pressure in the heart chambers can be maintained at a normal level, this heavy burden on the heart can be relieved.

    Professor Berezov of Gorky was the first to begin addressing this task. However, he was unable to complete this work. Young surgeons Afanasyev and Glebov were determined to continue and complete Professor Berezov's work.

    The surgery is relatively simple: a small hole is pierced in the pericardium through the abdominal cavity and diaphragm. Air enters the heart chamber through this small hole, and then the edges of the hole are sutured together. Thus, the surgery is completed. However, performing this surgery is a very complex matter. After thoroughly studying the method of opening a "window" for the heart, they began their first surgery.

    Sixty-four-year-old Voroshina from Stalingrad had suffered from heart disease for many years. Like all heart patients, she had to take medication daily to temporarily relieve the pain. Even walking up three or four flights of stairs would cause her to feel short of breath. She was the first patient to undergo surgery performed by Afanasyev. Three months later, Voroshina returned to Stalingrad. At this time, she could climb the steps on the banks of the Volga River by herself. These steps totaled one hundred and two!

              "Artificial Kidney"

    The Moscow Institute for Experimental Surgical Apparatus has created a machine called the "artificial kidney." When a person is sick or burned, the normal activity of the kidneys is sometimes disrupted. For example, the kidneys may not be able to continue removing harmful substances from the blood. In order to treat patients, the kidneys must be temporarily stopped from working during treatment or surgery. At this time, the machine called the "artificial kidney" can be used. During surgery, the "artificial kidney" is connected to the blood vessels, and it begins to perform the function of the kidneys. This specialized device can remove harmful substances from the blood. After the harmful substances are removed, the blood flows back into the patient's blood vessels.

          Surgical Techniques Seven to Ten Years From Now

    In seven to ten years, surgical techniques will be completely replaced by new technologies. Surgical procedures will be bloodless and painless. The surgical scalpel will be replaced by an ultrasonic knife. The ultrasonic knife can cut muscle tissue at a very fast speed, causing the blood to coagulate quickly and anesthetizing nerve endings. Specialized ultrasonic equipment can break down stones inside the liver and kidney into fine powder without damaging the liver and kidney tissue. There is no doubt that future surgery will be chemical surgery. Needles and thread (the necessary items for current surgical procedures) will no longer be used. Special glue can connect bones and human tissue. This glue has already been made. However, the most interesting thing is the "machine doctor" in future clinics. The "machine doctor" can quickly and accurately diagnose any disease. The principle of this machine is very simple. Its foundation is an electronic computer. The data about the patient's health will be represented in symbolic form. The Soviet Union has already tested several of these machines.

### 同疾病作斗争

专栏：苏联医学新事

    同疾病作斗争
        降低体温可以延长“临床死亡”
    呼吸结束、心脏停止跳动并不意味着人的真正死亡，这种现象在医学上叫“临床死亡”，这时，机体里还保持着少量的新陈代谢，真正的死亡通常要在几分钟以后才来到。在真正死亡还没有到来的短暂时间里，生命还可以夺取回来。但是“临床死亡”的时间，一般只能延续五、六分钟，这是因为人的大脑皮层很容易崩解，大脑皮层在心脏停止跳动后只能保持五、六分钟便要破坏。大脑破坏，机体就很难再恢复生命。因此，“临床死亡”的时间持续愈长，起死回生的希望也就愈大，延长临床死亡时间在医学上具有非常重大的意义，这也是苏联科学家们正在致力解决的一个重要课题。
    在苏联医学科学院列戈夫斯基教授领导的机体复苏实验室里，正在进行用降低体温来延长“临床死亡”时间的实验。经过在狗身上进行的多次实验证明，因失血过多而死亡的狗，如果施行降低体温，它的临床“死亡”时间可以从五、六分钟延长到半小时甚至一小时。由于施行降低体温的结果，实验室已经在临床死亡后一小时左右成功地做成了完全的持久的恢复全部机体生命的实验，其中甚至包括恢复大脑皮层的生命。
            心脏的窗子
    苏联国民经济展览会附设医院的年轻外科医生阿方纳谢夫解决了一个非常重要的问题。
    随着年龄的增长，人体日益衰老。由于血管的硬化，心脏的血液供给发生困难。心脏显著衰弱，以致于不能胜任人体必需的负担，经常疼痛，血管发生梗塞。
    怎样才能帮助心脏担负起沉重的负担呢？苏联著名医生莱因别尔格提出新的理论。
    问题在于心膜内部有一种消极压力。心脏把25％到40％的能力都消耗在克服这种压力方面。假如能使心腔的压力保持正常，就能解除心脏的这种沉重负担。
    第一个着手解决这个任务的是高尔基市别廖卓夫教授。然而他却未能把这一工作进行到底。年轻的外科医生阿方纳谢夫和葛列弗错夫决心要继续完成别廖卓夫教授的工作。
    这种手术比较简单：通过腹腔和隔膜在心膜上刺穿一个小孔，空气从这小孔进入心腔，然后把小孔边缘缝合起来。这样手术就结束了。然而进行这种手术是非常复杂的事情。当他们对开心脏“窗子”的方法进行彻底研究后，才开始进行第一次手术。
    斯大林格勒六十四岁的沃罗希娜患心脏病多年了。和所有心脏病患者一样，她不得不每天都服用能暂时减轻疼痛的药物。甚至走三、四阶楼梯也会使她感到呼吸紧迫。她是第一个接受阿方纳谢夫施行手术的病人。过了三个月，沃罗希娜回到了斯大林格勒。这时她自己就能上下伏尔加河岸边的台阶。要知道这台阶一共有一百零二级呢！
              “人造肾脏”
    莫斯科外科器械实验研究所创造了一种名为“人造肾脏”的机器。人患病或受烧伤时，肾脏的正常活动有时会受到破坏，例如肾脏不能继续清除血液中对人体有害的物质。为了治疗病人，在治疗或施行手术时，必须使肾脏暂时停止工作。这时就可以使用名为“人造肾脏”的机器。在施行手术时，将“人造肾脏”连接在血管上，于是它就开始执行肾脏的机能。这个专门装置能清除血液中的有害物质。有害物质清除后，血液又重新流入人体血管。
          七年到十年以后的外科技术
    再过七年到十年，外科技术将完全为新的技术所代替。进行外科手术将是无血无痛的。外科手术刀将由超声波刀所代替。超声波刀能以非常快的速度切开肌肉组织，使血液迅速凝结，并麻醉神经末稍。专门的超声波设备能毫不损伤肝脏和肾脏组织就把里面的结石粉碎为细末。毫无疑问，未来的外科学将是化学外科学。针和线
  （现在外科手术的必需品）将停止使用。特制的胶水能使骨胳和人体组织联接起来。这种胶水现在已经制成。然而最有趣的，还是未来门诊所里的“机器医生”。“机器医生”能够迅速而正确地诊断出任何一种病症。这种机器的原理非常简单。它的基础是电子计算仪器。这些仪器得到有关人体健康情形的材料将用符号形式表示出来。苏联现在已经试验了几台这种机器。
