Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 22nd: The Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant, winner of the national large and medium-sized blast furnace championship, had already exceeded its production plan for the first half of the year by June 15th, with a pig iron qualification rate reaching 99.5%.

　　At the beginning of this year, after mobilizing the masses to summarize the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, the Party Committee of Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant, following the instructions of the Benxi Municipal Party Committee of the CCP, further mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate technical measures to achieve this year's production plan and organized workers to launch a high-yield, high-quality, and low-consumption competition. The workers, focusing on strengthening blast furnace production, launched in-depth technical innovation activities. As a result, the utilization coefficient of the plant's blast furnaces increased from 2.00 in January to 2.436 month by month; from June 11th to 15th, the average blast furnace utilization coefficient further increased to 2.504.

　　While mobilizing the masses to increase pig iron production, the Party Committee of Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant also paid special attention to improving the quality of pig iron. In carrying out the mass movement for high yield and high quality, the Party Committee mobilized the masses to carefully analyze the reasons for the substandard pig iron, educated the workers on the importance of product quality, and relied on the masses to propose solutions. It also rectified and improved the quality inspection system, so the pig iron qualification rate since May has reached 100%.

　　Now, the plant's workers are actively studying and promoting the advanced experience put forward at the National Experience Exchange Conference on Large and Medium-sized Blast Furnaces, striving to make greater achievements in terms of high quality and high production.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant completed its major planned targets for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. By the end of May, the factory had completed 102.5% of its total output value plan for the first half of the year, an increase of 2.05 times compared to the same period last year; it completed 109% of its product output plan, with the output of major varieties such as micrometers, dial indicators, gauge blocks, and drills increasing by one to 3.5 times compared to the same period last year. The profits turned over by the factory in the first five months of this year are equivalent to the total profits turned over last year. The quality of measuring and cutting tools, which had once declined at the beginning of the year, a major weakness of the factory, has also gradually improved through efforts. In May, the qualification rate of universal measuring tools increased from 75.7% in the first quarter to 95.43%, and the qualification rate of cutting tools increased from 80.4% in the first quarter to 91.15%.

　　This year, the workers of the Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant launched a "thousand-minute shift production" competition (doing one thousand minutes of work in each eight-hour shift). Zhang Xikui, a worker in the gauge workshop, originally could not reach the quota, but after improving the ring gauge process in the competition, he achieved a shift output of two thousand five hundred minutes. Huang Huimin and the workers repeatedly studied and improved the grinding fixture, achieving a shift output of one thousand eight hundred minutes, while ensuring product quality. Xu Xinmin, a milling worker in the cutting tool workshop, improved the milling machine gears, increasing production efficiency by more than three times.

　　The workers also tried to improve operating techniques and save steel. The director of the cutting tool workshop personally worked with workers and technicians to repeatedly study and propose a new process of replacing cutting with stamping, saving more than five tons of cutting material. In April, they also produced 10,000 twisted drills, saving 50% of high-speed steel compared to milled drills. In April and May, the youth commando team of the cutting tool workshop extensively utilized material scraps to repair defective products, saving a total of 46 tons of steel.

    技术措施具体质量产量上升
    本溪第一钢铁厂  哈尔滨量具刃具厂超额完成上半年生产计划
    新华社本溪22日电　获得全国大中型高炉冠军的本溪第一钢铁厂，到6月15日止已经超额完成了今年上半年的生产计划，生铁合格率达到99.5％。
    今年年初，本溪第一钢铁厂党委在发动群众总结了去年大跃进的经验以后，就根据中共本溪市委的指示，进一步发动群众讨论订出了实现今年生产计划的技术措施，组织职工展开了高产优质低消耗的竞赛。职工们围绕着强化高炉生产问题，深入展开了技术革新活动。因此，全厂高炉利用系数由今年1月份的二·○○逐月上升到二·四三六；6月11日到15日，高炉利用系数平均又上升到二·五○四。
    本溪第一钢铁厂党委在发动群众提高生铁产量的同时，还特别重视提高生铁的质量。在开展高产优质的群众运动中，党委发动群众认真分析了部分生铁不合格的原因，向职工进行了重视产品质量的教育，同时依靠群众提出了解决的办法，整顿和健全了质量检查制度，因而5月份以来的生铁合格率达到了百分之百。
    现在，这个厂的职工正在积极学习和推广全国大中型高炉经验交流会议上所提出的先进经验，力争在优质高产方面作出更大的成就。
    新华社哈尔滨讯　哈尔滨量具刃具厂提前完成上半年各项主要计划指标。到5月底为止，这个工厂已经完成上半年总产值计划的102.5％，比去年同期增长二点零五倍；完成产品产量计划的109％，其中千分尺、千分表、块规、钻头等主要品种的产量，分别比去年同期提高一倍到三点五倍。这个工厂今年头五个月上缴的利润相当于去年上缴利润的总额。量具和刃具的质量年初一度下降是该厂的一大弱点，经过努力，也逐步提高。5月份万能量具的合格率由一季度的75.7％提高到95.43％，刃具的合格率由第一季度的80.4％提高到91.15％。
    今年，量具刃具厂职工开展了“班产千分钟”（每班八小时做一千分钟的工作量）竞赛运动。量规车间工人张锡奎原来达不到定额，在竞赛中改进环规工艺以后，达到班产两千五百分钟。黄惠民和工人一起多次研究改进刃磨卡具，达到班产一千八百分钟，同时保证了产品质量。刃具车间铣工徐新民改进了铣床齿轮后，生产效率提高三倍多。
    职工们还设法改进操作技术，节约钢材。刃具车间主任亲自和工人、技术员反复研究，提出以冲代切的新工艺，节省切口料五吨多。4月份他们还生产了一万支扭制钻头，比铣制钻头节约高速钢50％。4、5两个月，刃具车间青年突击队广泛利用料头修复废品，一共节约钢材四十六吨。
