Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 1st - The Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today the abolition of the military assistance agreement signed by the former Iraqi regime with the United States in April 1954, and the supplementary agreement signed in July 1955 regarding the use of weapons provided by the United States under the aforementioned agreement.

The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Iraqi government had notified the U.S. government on May 30 of its decision to abolish these two agreements, as well as Prime Minister Kassem's previously announced decision to sever Iraq's relations with the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The spokesman said, "Iraq's abolition of these agreements is part of the government's steps to end the relations established before the revolution in order to implement active neutrality."

The spokesman further said, "These agreements were attached with two conditions: one condition was that the country receiving aid must adhere to the diplomatic and military policies implemented by the U.S. government; the second condition was that the country receiving aid agreed with the U.S. plans and methods for various international issues. This means that accepting aid means supporting the U.S. camp, especially the Western bloc."

The spokesman said, "According to international law, this means restricting Iraq's independence and infringing upon its internal and external sovereignty. Iraq's acceptance of the Eisenhower Doctrine meant supporting the Western bloc against the Eastern bloc in the Cold War, thus exposing Iraq to unlimited danger."

The spokesman also said: "These agreements linked Iraq to the policies of the Western camp, which is not in line with Iraq's international status as an independent sovereign state striving to maintain peace."

The spokesman said that Iraq's declaration to abolish these agreements was due to "Iraq's hope to establish new international relations based on understanding and mutual benefit, and in line with the feelings of the Iraqi people," because Iraq hopes "to ensure the country's complete independence in the international arena and to pursue a policy away from the Cold War."

The spokesman stated that the Iraqi government hopes to strengthen relations with the United States on the basis of understanding, mutual benefit, and consolidating international peace in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. The spokesman finally said that the above-mentioned actions taken by the Iraqi government are "supplementary measures to Iraq's withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact, and a new page in the revolutionary government's struggle to achieve the independence and freedom of the Iraqi people."

### 伊拉克废除同美国的军援协定  外交部发言人说接受美援有损独立

    伊拉克废除同美国的军援协定
    外交部发言人说接受美援有损独立
    新华社巴格达1日电　伊拉克外交部发言人今天宣布废除伊拉克旧政权同美国在1954年4月签订的军事援助协定以及在1955年7月签订的关于使用美国根据上述协定提供的武器的补充协定。
    外交部发言人说，伊拉克政府已经在5月30日把它关于废除这两项协定以及卡塞姆总理曾经宣布的关于伊拉克同“艾森豪威尔主义”断绝关系的决定通知了美国政府。
    发言人说，“伊拉克废除这些协定是政府为了结束革命以前所建立的关系以便实行积极的中立而采取的步骤的一部分。”
    这位发言人又说，“这些协定附有两个条件：一个条件是接受援助的国家必须恪守美国政府执行的外交和军事政策：第二个条件是接受援助的国家同意美国对各项国际问题的计划和方法。这就是说，接受援助就要支持美国阵营，特别是西方集团。”
    发言人说，“按照国际法来说，这意味着限制伊拉克的独立，以及侵犯它对内和对外的主权。伊拉克接受艾森豪威尔主义意味着在冷战中支持西方集团反对东方集团，从而使伊拉克遭到无限的危险。”
    发言人还说：“这些协定使伊拉克同西方阵营的政策联系起来，而这种政策是不符合伊拉克作为一个为保持和平而努力的独立的主权国家的国际地位的。”
    发言人说，伊拉克宣布废除这些协定是由于“伊拉克希望建立以谅解和互利为基础的、而且符合伊拉克人民感情的、新的国际关系。”因为伊拉克希望“确保这个国家在国际上的完全独立，并且奉行远离冷战的政策”。
    发言人表示，伊拉克政府希望在谅解、互利以及按照联合国宪章的原则巩固国际和平的基础上加强同美国的关系。发言人最后说，伊拉克政府采取的上述行动，是“伊拉克退出巴格达条约的补充措施，而且是革命政府争取实现伊拉克人民的独立和自由的历史中的新的一页。”
