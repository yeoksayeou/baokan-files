    The Masses' General Affairs Department
    By our correspondents Gao Changren and Li Jinting
    Summer is here, and people are thinking of buying straw hats, palm-leaf fans, umbrellas, parasols, straw mats, slippers, fly swatters… The Changsha City Native Produce and Daily Use Sundries Retail Stores have already prepared these goods for everyone. In the Changsha City Urban Services Bureau's Native Produce and Daily Use Sundries Purchasing and Wholesale Main Store, the supply of goods is very abundant. Whether they are procurement staff from government offices, cooks from canteens, or housewives, they can buy what they need from any of the distribution outlets. These daily use sundries stores handle more than 20,000 kinds of commodities, including pottery, porcelain, ironware, local paper, rain gear, straw-woven products, cooking utensils, and small sundries.
    There are tens of thousands of varieties of daily use sundries, coming from all directions, and each commodity contains the arduous labor and fiery hearts of commercial personnel serving the people. Here are just a few examples:
    In the past, Changsha City always used palm fiber to make brooms. Last year, when the employees of the wholesale store learned that palm fiber had more important uses and that bamboo shoot leaves could be used instead for palm brooms, they immediately sent procurement personnel to Qidong County to purchase a large batch of bamboo shoot leaves and promptly processed them into bamboo leaf brooms. They also purchased a batch of brooms made of sorghum heads from the countryside in Changsha County, satisfying the market's needs. Last winter, in order to save charcoal, the citizens of Changsha were willing to switch to burning coal briquettes for heating, but they were worried about not having stoves. The employees of the daily use sundries wholesale store painstakingly researched and came up with a way to modify the original charcoal-burning braziers so that they could burn coal briquettes, which was both convenient and economical. Braving the severe cold, they went to the suburbs to transport clay and furnace grates, and helped citizens modify more than 10,000 stoves themselves.
    More than 20,000 kinds of commodities require many units to produce and process them. If a production or processing unit encounters difficulties in production, it will affect the completeness of the supply and the needs of the masses. Whenever this happens, the employees of the sundries wholesale store always try their best to provide support. Last year, when the Changsha Jianxiang Porcelain Factory, which had business relations with them, felt that gypsum was insufficient, the employees of the wholesale store took the initiative to find ways to supply a batch of gypsum, solving the difficulties of the Jianxiang Porcelain Factory. On one occasion, the umbrella factory lacked a certain kind of wood for making umbrellas, so they selected a portion from the large batch of wood they had purchased for making hoe handles to support the umbrella factory. This batch of umbrellas was delivered on time and supplied to the market. Because they pay attention to the production, processing, procurement, and supply of commodities at all times, they can find ways to make preparations as early as possible before a certain commodity is about to run out of stock, avoiding shortages.
    The procurement staff and salespersons here are always silently, diligently, and tirelessly thinking of the masses. Li Xiaoting, the procurement staff responsible for small sundries, often goes to the retail departments to work as a salesperson or visits residents and government offices to understand the market situation, and even when walking on the street, he always pays attention to listening to the masses' opinions on commodities. Procurement staff Wang Yixing and Peng Xinyuan traverse mountains and ridges in the mountainous areas of Cili, Shimen, and Taoyuan counties, which are rich in grass paper, to organize the supply of goods. Whether it is in the middle of the night or at the break of dawn, as long as the masses come to deliver goods, they accept them as soon as they arrive. Grass paper is bulky and difficult to store; a room cannot hold even three or four hundred reams. They have to receive more than 20,000 reams at a time, so where can they put them? In order to prevent the grass paper from getting wet from the rain, they try every means to borrow old houses not inhabited by the masses, and clean up abandoned pigsties themselves for storage. When transporting goods, if there is insufficient transportation capacity, they move, load, and ship the goods themselves, trying every means to transport the goods back as quickly as possible to meet the needs of the masses. The masses call them "the masses' general affairs department." Recently, the retail departments of the daily use sundries store have also established repair and processing groups to repair old and damaged sundries for the masses at any time.

    群众的总务科
    本报记者  高长任  李进挺
    夏天来了，人们想起应该买顶草帽，买把葵扇，还有雨伞、旱伞、草席、拖鞋、蝇拍……。这些货品，长沙市的土产日用杂品零售店已经为大家准备好了。在长沙市城市服务局土产日用杂品采购批发总店里，货源非常充足。机关的采购员、食堂的炊事员、家庭主妇们不管从哪个分销店里都能买到他们所需要的东西。这些日用杂品商店经营的商品有陶器、瓷器、铁器、土纸、雨具、草质编织品、炊事用具、以及细小杂品等不下二万多种。
    日用杂品的品种成千上万，来路百端千条，每一样商品都包含着商业人员艰苦的劳动，为人民服务的火热心肠。这里只举几件事情：
    长沙市过去一向是用棕片做扫帚的。去年，当批发店的职工了解到棕片有了更重要的用途，棕扫帚可以用竹笋叶子代替时，就立即派出采购员到祁东县去购回一大批竹笋叶子，及时加工做成了竹叶扫帚。他们又从长沙县乡下采购了一批用高粱穗扎的扫帚，满足了市场的需要。去年冬天，长沙市市民为了节省木炭，都愿意改烧煤球来烤火取暖，只是发愁没有炉子。日用杂品批发商店的职工们就苦心研究，想出了把原来烧木炭的火盆改装一下就可烧煤球的办法，既省事又节约。他们冒着严寒，到郊区去运粘土，运炉桥，自己动手帮助市民改装了一万多个炉子。
    两万多种商品，是要很多单位来生产和加工的，假若有一个生产和加工单位生产上发生了困难，就会影响货源的齐全和群众的需要。每当这个时候，杂品批发商店的职工总是想办法尽力支援。去年，和他们有业务关系的长沙建湘瓷厂感到石膏不足时，批发商店的职工们就主动想办法供应一批石膏，解决了建湘瓷厂的困难。有一次，雨伞厂缺少制雨伞的某种木料，他们就从收购来的准备做锄头把手用的大批木料中，选出一部分支援雨伞厂，这批雨伞就按时交货供应了市场。由于他们随时随地关心商品生产、加工、采购、供应各方面的情况，就能够在某种商品快要脱销以前及早想办法，作准备，避免脱销。
    这里的采购员、售货员们总是默默地、勤勤恳恳地、不辞劳苦地为群众着想。负责细小杂品的采购员李孝庭，为了了解市场情况，经常跑到门市部去当售货员或到居民和机关中去访问，甚至连在街上走路，也随时注意倾听群众对商品的意见。采购员王宜兴和彭新元，为了采购草纸，在盛产草纸的慈利、石门、桃源等县的山区翻山越岭组织货源；不管是三更半夜，还是五更拂晓，只要群众前来送货，他们就随到随收。草纸体积大、不好保管，一间房子也放不了三四百刀，他们一次就要收二万多刀，放到什么地方好呢？他们为了不让草纸雨淋受湿，就四处设法借用群众不住的旧房，自己动手打扫被废弃的猪栏存放；运货时运输力不足，他们就自己搬运、装船、装车，想一切办法，尽快地把东西运回去，供应群众需要。群众称呼他们是“群众的总务科”。最近，日用杂品商店门市部又都成立了修补加工组，随时为群众修补破旧、损伤的杂品。
