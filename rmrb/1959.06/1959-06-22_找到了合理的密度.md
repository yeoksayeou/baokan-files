    Found a Reasonable Density
  　Li Jinqing
    To what extent is wheat densely planted to be considered reasonable? This question has caused much debate among cadres and the masses. Some young people advocate for the denser the better, their reasoning being that more seeds mean more plants, more ears, and therefore higher yields; older people disagree, advocating for the sparser the better, arguing that sparse planting results in thicker wheat stalks, longer ears, larger grains, and therefore higher yields. So, what is the appropriate density? The CCP Yinjiang County Committee in Guizhou Province conducted multiple studies. Initially, they decided to use 100 jin of seeds per mu, and after experimenting in test fields, it proved to be too dense. Therefore, they adopted a method of nationwide discussion, combining the summary of past high-yield experiences from the bottom up and from the top down to determine the dense planting specifications, with the majority of the county using 20 to 30 jin of seeds per mu.
    In terms of dense planting methods, wide-row strip sowing has been universally implemented. Row spacing is generally 5 to 7 inches, and sowing width is 3 to 4 inches. The row spacing is reduced by half compared to previous years, and the sowing width is increased by 2 to 3 inches, which not only makes full use of the land but also ensures the nutritional needs of each wheat seedling.
    According to the investigation at harvest time, under the same conditions, the yield per mu using less than 20 jin of seeds generally increased by 15 to 20 times compared to the original seed amount; the yield per mu using 20 to 30 jin of seeds generally increased by 12 to 20 times compared to the original seed amount; the yield per mu using 40 to 80 jin of seeds generally increased by 1 to 2 times compared to the original seed amount; the yield per mu using more than 100 jin of seeds generally increased by half compared to the original seed amount or did not even reach the original seed amount.
    Practice has proven that, under the current circumstances, the amount of wheat seeds used should generally be 20 to 30 jin per mu. Yinjiang County's total wheat production this year increased by 48.2% compared to last year, and the yield per mu increased by 38%, which is greatly related to reasonable dense planting.

    找到了合理的密度
  　李进青
    小麦密植到什么程度才算合理？这个问题在干部和群众中争执很大。有的青年人主张越密越好，他们的道理是种子多，株数就多，穗多产量多；老年人不以为然，主张越稀越好，理由是种稀麦秆粗壮，穗长粒大产量多。究竟密度以多少为宜？中共贵州印江县委进行了多次研究。最初决定每亩用种一百斤，在试验田里搞了一下，证明太密了。于是便采取全民讨论的方法，通过总结过去的丰产经验，从下至上和从上至下相结合订出了密植规格，全县以每亩用种二十至三十斤的占绝大多数。
    在密植的方法上，普遍实行了宽幅条播。行距一般是五至七寸，播幅是三至四寸，行距比往年缩短一倍，播幅增宽二至三寸，这样，既充分利用了土地，又保证每株麦苗的营养需要。
    根据收割时的调查，在同样的条件下，每亩用种二十斤以下的，一般产量比原种子增长十五倍到二十倍；用种二十斤至三十斤的，一般产量比原种子增长十二倍到二十倍；用种四十斤至八十斤的，一般比原种子量增长一倍至二倍；用种一百斤以上的，一般产量比原种子增长半倍或达不到原用种量。
    实践证明，在当前的情况下，小麦用种量一般以每亩二十斤至三十斤为合适。印江县今年小麦总产量比去年增加48.2％，单产增加38％，和合理密植有很大关系。
