    Selecting Seeds Every Year, Increasing Yield Every Year
    Yanshi Yuetan Brigade's Experience in Selecting and Breeding High-Quality Wheat Varieties
    By Our Reporter Zhang Lizhong

    The Yuetan Production Brigade in Yanshi County, Henan, has increased its wheat yield year by year due to selecting seeds every year.

    In 1953, the Yuetan Brigade introduced the improved variety "Bima No. 1" for the first time. The ear of this variety was half a section longer than the local variety "Dakou Huang." This comparison aroused the interest of the masses in seed selection. The following year, due to intensive cultivation and meticulous farming, the yield of "Bima No. 1" wheat increased from 180 jin per mu in 1953 to 228 jin per mu. After that, people paid special attention to wheat seed selection, established seed fields, and gradually increased the purity of the seeds to 99%. The comparison test between selected and unselected seeds in 1958 was as follows: seeds that had not been selected yielded 589 jin per mu; generally screened seeds, under the same cultivation conditions, yielded 12 jin more wheat per mu; seeds from the seed field that had been selected ear by ear yielded 17 jin more per mu. This shows that the more carefully the seeds are selected, the better. Currently, the Yuetan Brigade has introduced and cultivated more than 300 varieties from other places, including high-yielding varieties, lodging-resistant varieties, rust-resistant varieties, large-grained varieties, and white-flour varieties, of all kinds.

    The Yuetan Brigade Party Branch of the Laocheng Commune has always attached importance to seed selection and retention. Before the summer harvest and planting, a seed selection committee of 13 people was established, headed by Liu Yingxiang, the party branch secretary of the brigade. Each production team, led by the team leader, absorbed seed selection technicians and experienced farmers to form seed selection teams of five to seven people, totaling more than 130 people. Before the wheat harvest, Liu Yingxiang led the professional seed selection team members to the fields to explain the significance of continuous seed selection for wheat. At the same time, they provided technical education to the professional seed selection team members on identifying wheat varieties, lecturing and selecting on the spot, and identifying different varieties such as large-eared, plump-grained, lodging-resistant, and rust-resistant through practical comparison.

    Facts show that if high-quality wheat varieties are not carefully selected and improved every year, they will gradually degenerate. The seed selection experts of the Yuetan Brigade deeply recognize this point. They are particularly strict when selecting seeds, selecting large and full ears, and also selecting main ears that are uniformly mature and uniformly grown. The brigade's seed fields account for 5% of the total wheat fields each year. The seed fields are located in places with sufficient sunlight, flat terrain, fertile land, and good water conservancy conditions. The seeds selected ear by ear are used for planting in the seed fields; the seeds harvested from the seed fields, after removing impurities and inferior seeds, are harvested and threshed separately, and used as seeds for the large fields. Due to the meticulous and regular seed work of the Yuetan Brigade, the quality of the seeds has improved year by year. For example, when "Bima No. 1" was introduced in 1953, 18,000 grains weighed one jin. After several years of continuous careful selection and improvement, 15,000 grains could weigh one jin.

    While carefully selecting seeds year after year, the Yuetan Brigade also launched mass activities to cultivate new varieties. They have a 40-plus mu experimental field, where improved varieties from Soviet Ukraine, Odessa, India, Egypt, and various parts of our country are cultivated. Adaptability comparison tests are conducted on varieties such as "Nanda 2419," "Zhongnong 28," and "Sichuan 51" to assess their lodging resistance and rust resistance in the local area. In addition, this experimental field also cultivates more than 60 new varieties, which are named Yuete, Yuebai, Yuehong, etc., according to their shape and color. Branch Secretary Liu Yingxiang also specially learned sexual hybridization and asexual hybridization techniques from other places, hybridizing varieties with large ears with varieties with thick stalks, and hybridizing plump-grained varieties with rust-resistant varieties. These techniques have also been mastered by young people. The brigade branch also called on each party member and cadre to select more than 100 ears, ten plants; to encourage the selection and breeding of new varieties, any commune member who selects a superior mutant single ear will be rewarded with one workday after acceptance. This year, due to the large-scale bumper harvest movement launched after communization, with more than 30 jin sown per mu, this has placed new demands on seeds. Therefore, the brigade decided to conduct an appraisal of the existing 306 varieties, selecting new varieties with good qualities such as large ears, many grains, plump grains, lodging resistance, and disease resistance. From the current observation, in addition to the excellent varieties such as "Nanda 2419," "Zhongnong 28," and "Huixian Hong," which have been proven good in other places, ten new varieties cultivated by themselves, such as "Yuete No. 1" and "Yuebai No. 21," have the advantages of lodging resistance, large ears, and plump grains.

    The Yuetan Brigade has also created some experiences in the collection, storage, and management of selected improved varieties. All improved varieties are harvested, threshed, and stored separately, with dedicated personnel responsible for the process of harvesting, threshing, and managing. After the seeds are stored in the warehouse, measures are taken to prevent mixing, mildew, rodents and birds, and insect pests, and humidity and temperature are regularly checked. This year, it is required that the purity and cleanliness of the seeds reach 100%.

    The Yuetan Brigade requires the diversification of excellent varieties for seed retention this year. In the past, the brigade planted more than 1,000 mu of wheat, all with "Bima No. 1." This year, due to sufficient water and fertilizer, the stalks of "Bima No. 1" are tall, and some have lodged after a storm. At the same time, they are also susceptible to rust, and the uniform maturity of the same variety brings about labor shortages during harvesting. Based on the above situation, the Yuetan Brigade Branch decided that in the autumn planting of wheat, "Bima No. 1" will account for 30%, "Nanda 2419" will account for 50%, and "Zhongnong 28" will account for 20%. Preparations for these three varieties have already begun.

    种子年年选　产量年年增
    偃师岳滩大队选育小麦良种经验
    本报记者　张励中
    河南偃师县岳滩生产大队因为年年选种，小麦产量年年增高。
    1953年，岳滩大队第一次引进良种“碧蚂一号”，穗头比本地品种“大口黄”长半截子，对比之下，引起了群众选种的兴趣。第二年又由于精耕细作，“碧蚂一号”小麦由1953年亩产一百八十斤提高到亩产二百二十八斤。之后，人们特别重视小麦选种工作，建立了种子田，使种子纯度逐渐提高到99％。1958年选种和不选种的对比试验是：没有选过的种子，每亩产量五百八十九斤；一般种子经过筛选的，同样的耕作条件，每亩地多收十二斤麦；种子田的种籽又经过穗选的，每亩多收十七斤。这说明种子选的越细越好。现在岳滩大队从外地引来和自己培育的品种有三百多种，其中有高产的，有抗倒伏的，抗锈病的，子大的，出面白的，各种各样。
    老城公社岳滩大队党支部历来就重视选种留种工作。在夏收夏种前以大队支部书记刘应祥为首，建立了十三人的选种委员会；各生产队，以队长为主，吸收选种技术员、老农组成五至七人的选种小组，共一百三十多人。在收麦前，由刘应祥率领选种专业组员，到田间讲解小麦连年选种的意义，同时对专业选种队员进行识别小麦品种的技术教育，就地讲，就地选，从实际对比中识别哪是穗大、子肥、抗倒伏、抗锈病等不同品种。
    事实说明，小麦良种，如果不是年年精选提高，就要逐渐退化，岳滩大队的选种专家们深刻地认清了这一点。他们在选种时特别严格，要选大而饱满的穗，同时要成熟一致、生长整齐的主穗。这个队每年的种子田要占全部麦田5％，种子田设在阳光充足、地势平坦、土地肥沃、水利条件较好的地方。穗选的种子，作为种子田播种用；种子田收的种子，经过去杂去劣，单收单打，作为大田的种子。由于岳滩大队种子工作细致经常，种子的质量年年提高，如“碧蚂一号”在1953年引进时，一万八千粒一市斤，经过几年的不断精选提高，一万五千粒就能打一斤了。
    岳滩大队在连年精选种子的同时，还开展群众性的培育新品种的活动。他们有块四十多亩的试验场，这里培育着有来自苏联乌克兰、敖德萨和印度、埃及以及我国各地的良种。作适应性比较试验的，有“南大二四一九”、“中农二八”、“四川五一”等，以鉴定这些品种在当地抗倒伏、抗锈病的效果。除此以外，这个试验场还培育着六十多个新品种，这些品种按形状、色泽分别冠以岳特、岳白、岳红等排列成号。支部书记刘应祥还特地从外地学来有性杂交与无性杂交的技术，把穗子大的品种与秆子粗的品种进行杂交，把子肥的品种与抗锈病的品种杂交。这些技术也为青年们所掌握了。大队支部还号召每个党员、干部选百粒以上的穗十棵；为鼓励选育新品种，凡是社员选出一棵优良变异的单穗，经验收合格后，奖励一个劳动日。今年，由于公社化以后开展了大面积丰产运动，每亩播种三十斤以上，这对种子又有了新的要求。因而，这个大队决定将现有三百零六个品种进行一次鉴定，从中选出穗大、粒多、子饱、抗倒伏、抗病的品质好的新品种。从现在观察来看，除了在外地已经证明好的“南大二四一九”、“中农二八”、“辉县红”等优良品种外，他们自己培育的“岳特一号”、“岳白二一号”等十个新品种具有抗倒伏、穗大、子饱的优点。
    岳滩大队对选育良种的收藏、保管工作也创造了一些经验。凡是优良品种一律采取单收、单打、单保管，收、打、管的过程都设专人负责。种子入库后，作到防混杂、防霉变、防鼠雀、防虫害，定期检验湿度、温度。今年要求种子纯度、净度都达到百分之百。
    岳滩大队今年选留种子要求做到优良品种多样化。过去，这个大队种一千多亩麦子，青一色种“碧蚂一号”，今年由于水肥足，“碧蚂一号”秆高，经过一场暴风雨有些倒伏，同时又生了锈病，而且由于同样品种成熟一致，给收割带来劳力紧张的困难。根据以上情况，岳滩大队支部确定今秋播种小麦“碧蚂一号”占30％，“南大二四一九”占50％，“中农二八”占20％。现在已经着手准备这三个品种。
