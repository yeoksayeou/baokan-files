The heavy military expenditure, the perennial deficit

    Since Thailand joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in 1954, the Thai government's further pursuit of the US policy of arms expansion and war preparation has led to increasingly serious economic difficulties, an empty treasury, and a miserable life for the people.

    Huge military expenditures have become a heavy burden on Thailand's finances every year. Taking 1958 as an example, Thailand's total budget expenditure was 6.7 billion baht, of which the Ministry of Defense's expenditure was 1.432 billion baht, plus 400 million baht for expenses related to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, expenses for troops stationed in South Korea, and hospitality expenses for US military officers, security expenses, etc., and 382 million baht for the Police Department, totaling 2.2 billion baht in military-related expenditures, accounting for one-third of the total budget expenditure (Thai "Economic Bi-Monthly" May 1, 1958). If we add various military-related expenditures hidden under other names, then Thailand's direct and indirect military expenditures certainly far exceed this figure. The military expenditure for 1959 has not been fully published yet, but judging from the current draft budget, the Ministry of Defense's expenditure alone amounts to 1.4121 billion baht, still ranking first in the budget expenditure.

    As a result of following the US policy of arms expansion and war preparation, Thailand has suffered huge financial deficits over the years. From 1954 to 1958, Thailand's budget revenue and expenditure had deficits every year, ranging from 600 million baht to as much as 1.2 billion baht.

    The 1959 budget is still under discussion. According to reports, it is still necessary to borrow 1.11 billion baht from domestic and foreign sources this year to balance revenue and expenditure. That is to say, the deficit in 1959 increased by 280 million baht compared with 1958. According to Thai official statistics, the deficits in the government budget for the eight years up to 1958 totaled 9.561 billion baht. Adding this year's 1.11 billion, the budget deficit in this country for nine years amounted to more than 10 billion baht. The Thai government has always used methods such as borrowing, increasing taxes, and issuing currency indiscriminately to make up for the deficit. According to an announcement by the Thai government, as of the end of December 1958, the government's outstanding domestic and foreign debts had reached 10 billion baht, equivalent to about 500 million US dollars. The amount of currency issued was 4.907 billion baht at the end of 1951, and it had increased to 8.043 billion baht by June 1958.

    Huge trade deficit

    Thailand has increasingly deepened its economic dependence on the United States, and its foreign trade has suffered heavy losses under the long-term monopoly and plunder of the United States.

    Rice is Thailand's primary export commodity, accounting for about 50% of the total export value. However, in recent years, due to the United States' massive dumping of surplus agricultural products in Asia, seizing Thailand's traditional market for rice, Thailand's rice exports have sharply decreased. For example, Japan purchased 347,000 metric tons of Thai rice in 1955, only 116,000 metric tons in 1957, and only 51,900 metric tons in the first half of 1958. Thailand's rice exports in 1958 were only about 70% of those in 1957. Since the beginning of this year, the export situation of Thai rice has not improved. According to statistics published by the Thai Ministry of Economic Affairs, in the first quarter of 1959, Thailand exported a total of 266,911 tons of rice, a decrease of 151,735 tons compared with the same period last year. Currently, only 14 of the 80 large rice mills in Thailand can maintain production, and only 2,000 of the 3,000 small rice mills are actually operating.

    Rubber is Thailand's second largest export commodity, and in recent years, it has also suffered significant losses due to the US's price suppression purchases. It is estimated that from 1951 to 1956, Thai rubber suffered a loss of nearly 3 billion baht due to the US's monopoly price suppression. In the past three years, although the production of Thai rubber has increased year by year, the income has decreased year by year. For example, although the export volume of Thai rubber in the first half of 1958 increased by 5,600 tons compared with the same period in 1957, the total export value decreased by 123 million baht compared with the same period in 1957.

    The price of tin, another important export commodity, has also been repeatedly lowered. In 1955, when the international market price of tin rose, the United States proposed that Thailand reduce the price of tin by 30 US dollars per ton lower than the market price, and threatened to terminate the tin purchase agreement. In recent years, due to the reduction in purchases by US monopoly groups, the "International Tin Council" has stipulated export quotas in order to maintain the price of tin. Compared with the same period in 1957, the production and export of Thai tin concentrate in the first half of 1958 decreased by 50%. Currently, Thailand has 4,000 tons of tin that cannot be sold, many tin mines have closed down, and a large number of workers have been laid off.

    As mentioned above, with the sharp decline in the export of major products such as rice, rubber, and tin, the United States and other capitalist countries have dumped heavily on the Thai market, resulting in a serious trade deficit for Thailand. Especially since Thailand participated in the US's "embargo" in 1952, it has greatly hindered the normal development of its foreign trade, lost favorable sales markets, deepened its dependence on the United States, and enabled the United States to arbitrarily monopolize, suppress prices, and plunder. From 1950 to 1958, Thailand's foreign trade had a surplus only in the first three years, and the surplus decreased year by year. Since 1953, there has not been a single year without a deficit. The deficit in 1958 was the largest, reaching 1.07465 billion baht.

    It can be seen that under the long-term plunder of the United States, Thailand's trade difficulties are serious. Especially since following the United States in participating in the "embargo" in 1952, foreign trade has been declining. In recent years, frequent huge deficits have pushed Thailand to the brink of bankruptcy in international balance of payments.

  "US Aid" has brought economic difficulties

    The Thai government has always pinned its economic hopes on "US aid". US "aid" to Thailand is divided into military and economic and technical aid. Military aid mainly provides a large amount of military equipment and military supplies. As for the so-called economic "aid", according to the Thai government, since Thailand and the United States signed the "Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement" in 1950, the United States has given Thailand a total of 3.242 billion baht, equivalent to 162 million US dollars, in eight years (including 1958). In addition, according to the report of the US International Cooperation Administration, as of March 31, 1958, the total amount of economic "aid" allocated to Thailand was 161 million US dollars, and the actual expenditure was 112 million US dollars, that is, the actual payment of aid funds only accounted for 69% of the allocated amount. If we look at the actual use, most of it is used for military purposes. From 1950 to March 31, 1957, out of the total actual expenditure of more than 84.8 million US dollars, "direct military support" and "defense support" totaled more than 74.5 million US dollars, accounting for 88%, while the so-called "technical cooperation" accounted for less than one-eighth.

    Therefore, whether it is this "aid" in the name of "economy" or military aid mainly based on dumping military equipment and military supplies, it has nothing to do with improving the Thai economy. On the contrary, Thailand has to endure many political and economic constraints for this, spend huge defense expenditures, and support a large number of American "experts" and American soldiers who interfere in Thailand's internal affairs. It is estimated that Thailand spends no less than 500 million baht annually to support American soldiers and "experts".

    Due to accepting this huge amount of "aid", Thailand must step up arms expansion and war preparation. In recent years, under this "aid", the Thai authorities have built many military bases, airports, strategic highways, and barracks on a large scale. Thailand's army, navy, and air force have been expanded to 116,000 people. In addition, Thailand has 50,000 policemen, and in the future, it plans to expand its armed forces to 200,000 people with US aid. Obviously, this kind of "aid" will only make Thailand forever tired of running on the road of arms expansion and war preparation, and make Thailand's economic difficulties increasingly fall into an incurable situation.

    The people's lives are miserable

    As a result of following the US arms expansion and war preparation and accepting "US aid", Thailand's economic crisis has become increasingly serious, and the people's lives are very difficult. In recent years, prices in Thailand have continued to rise, and the people's living standards have declined. Thailand is a rice-producing country, but in the past two years, even the price of rice in the country has risen a lot. In June 1957, the price of rice was 15.7 baht per kilogram, and by June 1958, it had risen to 20 baht, and in October 1958, it had risen to 22 baht, which is 40% higher than in June 1957. The cost of living has increased year by year. Taking the Bangkok area as an example, the cost of living index was 100 in 1953, and it had already increased to 132 in October 1958. Under the circumstances of expensive rice and firewood, the income of the vast working people is constantly decreasing. In 1958, the monetary income of each farmer decreased by 55% compared with 1957. Tin miners not only have a large number of people unemployed, but also the wages of workers in the industry have been reduced by 20%-30%. The income of low-level civil servants is also far from keeping up with the increase in prices. From 1941 to 1958, the cost of living index increased by 19 times, while the income of low-level civil servants decreased by 42% according to the increased cost of living index. The tax burden imposed on the Thai people by the Thai government is also extremely heavy. According to the data of the "Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East", in recent years, the total amount of tax revenue in Thailand has increased by 1 billion baht, from 3.612 billion baht in 1953 to 4.653 billion baht in 1957. At the beginning of 1958, the Thai government decided to increase taxes again by 15%-20%. It is estimated that the tax burden of the Thai people accounts for about 11%-12% of their income every year. Currently, the Thai people are living in a deep abyss of suffering, and the phenomenon of starvation and fleeing famine is not uncommon. Recently, the Permanent Secretary of the Thai Ministry of Public Health, Luan Pingbo, revealed that the number of mental patients in Thailand has been increasing in recent years. He admitted that the people's difficult lives, the difficulty of making a living, and the rising cost of living are the reasons for the increasing number of mental patients. Thai residents almost completely do not receive medical care. About one-third of the residents of Thailand, that is, 6.5 million people, suffer from malaria, and 1.2 million people suffer from special skin diseases. According to the figures released to the press by Nai Nudan Saiyabai, director of the Thai Anti-Tuberculosis Bureau, on March 9 this year, there are more than 75,000 people suffering from lung disease in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, with a population of 1.5 million, an average of one lung disease patient in every 20 people. He admitted that most of these patients are poor working people.

    From the above facts, it can be clearly seen that the Thai authorities' policy of following the United States is fundamentally not in line with the national interests of Thailand. In recent years, the broad masses of people in Thailand have constantly condemned this policy, demanding that Thailand get rid of the shackles of the United States, withdraw from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, develop the national economy, and improve the people's lives. This demand is entirely justified. If the Thai authorities continue to ignore this demand, they will become increasingly isolated and reap the bitter fruit.

    泰国追随美国侵略政策的恶果
    林放
    浩大的军费，连年的赤字
    1954年泰国参加东南亚侵略集团以后，泰国政府进一步追随美国扩军备战政策的结果，使得泰国经济困难日趋严重，国库空虚，民不聊生。
    巨额的军费开支，每年都成为泰国财政上的沉重负担。以1958年为例，泰国预算总支出为六十七亿铢，其中国防部的支出为十四亿三千二百万铢，加上有关东南亚条约组织的开支、留在南朝鲜军队的开支、美国军官的招待费、治安费等四亿铢和警察厅方面费用三亿八千二百万铢，总计有关军事性开支高达二十二亿铢，占预算总支出的三分之一（1958年5月1日泰国“经济半月刊”）。如果加上隐藏在其他名义下的各种与军事有关的开支，那么泰国直接间接的军事费用当然远远超过这个数字。1959年的军费开支，还没有全部发表，但就目前的预算草案看来，仅国防部开支一项就达十四亿一千二百一十万铢，依然在预算开支中占第一位。
    追随美国扩军备战政策的结果，泰国历年来财政上都出现庞大的赤字。从1954年到1958年这五年，泰国预算收支年年有赤字，少者六亿铢，多者竟达十二亿铢。
    1959年的预算还在讨论。据报道，今年依然需要向国内外借款十一亿一千万铢，才能使收支平衡。那就是说，1959年的赤字比1958年又增加了二亿八千万铢。据泰国官方统计，到1958年为止的八年间，政府预算中出现的赤字已共达九十五亿六千一百多万铢，加上今年的十一亿一千万，这个国家九年间的预算赤字竟达一百多亿铢。泰国政府历年来都是用借债、加重税收和滥发货币等办法来弥补赤字的。据泰国官方宣布，截至1958年12月止，政府积欠的内外债务已达一百亿铢，约合五亿美元。货币发行额1951年底为四十九亿零七百万铢，至1958年6月已增加到八十亿四千三百万铢。
      巨额的贸易入超
    泰国在经济上日益加深了对美国的依附，它的对外贸易长期在美国的垄断与掠夺下，蒙受着深重的损失。
    大米是泰国第一位出口物资，约占输出总值的50％。但近几年来，由于美国在亚洲大量倾销剩余农产品，抢夺了泰米的传统市场，泰米的出口锐减。例如，1955年日本购买泰米三十四万七千公吨，1957年仅购十一万六千公吨，而1958年上半年仅购五万一千九百公吨。1958年泰国出口的大米仅为1957年的70％左右。而今年以来，泰米的出口情况依然未见好转，据泰国经济部发表的统计，1959年第一季度，泰米输出共二十六万六千九百一十一吨，比去年同期又减少十五万一千七百三十五吨。目前，在泰国的八十家大碾米厂中，只有十四家能够维持生产，在三千家小型碾米厂中，实际开工的只有二千家。
    橡胶是泰国第二位出口物资，近年来，也由于美国的压价购买而遭受到很大的损失。据估计从1951年到1956年，泰胶由于美国的垄断压价而受的损失将近三十亿铢。近三年来，泰胶产量虽逐年增加，但收入却逐年在减少，如1958年上半年泰胶输出量虽比1957年同期增加了五千六百吨，但输出总值却比1957年同期减少了一亿二千三百万铢。
    另一重要出口物资锡的价格，也一再被压低。1955年当国际市场锡价上涨之际，美国却提出要泰国将锡价每吨较市价压低三十美元，并以停止购锡协定相威胁。近年来，由于美国垄断集团减少收购量，“国际锡业理事会”为了维持锡价，规定了出口限额。1958年上半年同1957年同期相较，泰国锡精矿的生产和出口减少了50％，目前泰国存有四千吨锡卖不出去，很多锡矿倒闭，大批工人失业。
    如上所述，在米、橡胶和锡等主要产品输出锐减的情况下，美国和其他资本主义国家又大量向泰国市场倾销，这就使得泰国对外贸易出现严重的入超。尤其是1952年泰国参加美国的“禁运”以后，更大大地阻碍了它对外贸易的正常发展，丧失了有利的销售市场，加深了对美国的依附，使得美国可以恣意的垄断、压价与掠夺。从1950年到1958年，泰国对外贸易只有头三年是出超，而且出超额逐年下降，从1953年起则没有一年不是入超，1958年入超最多，达十亿七千四百六十五万多铢。
    由此可见，在美国的长期掠夺下，泰国贸易上的困难是严重的，特别是自1952年追随美国参加“禁运”后，对外贸易就一直走下坡路，几年来，经常的巨额入超，使泰国在国际收支上濒于破产的境地。
  “美援”带来了经济困难
    泰国政府一向将其经济出路寄望于“美援”。美国对泰国的“援助”分做军事与经济技术两种。军事援助主要是提供大量的军火和军用物资。至于所谓的经济“援助”，据泰国政府公布，自1950年泰美签订“经济技术援助协定”以来，八年间（包括1958年度），美国共给泰国三十二亿四千二百万铢，合一亿六千二百万美元。另外根据美国国际合作总署的报告，截至1958年3月31日止，对泰国经济“援助”的拨款总额为一亿六千一百多万美元，实际开支额为一亿一千二百多万美元，即援款的实际支付只占拨款数的69％。如果再从实际用途来看，则用于军事性质方面的又占绝大部分。从1950年到1957年3月31日止，在总计八千四百八十多万美元的实际开支中，“直接军队支持”和“防卫支持”两项合计为七千四百五十多万美元，占88％，而所谓“技术合作”还不到八分之一。
    因此，无论这种以“经济”为名的“援助”或者是以倾销军火和军事物资为主的军事援助，都与改善泰国经济毫不相干。相反地，泰国还得为此忍受许多政治、经济上的束缚，支出浩大的国防开支，供养大批干涉泰国内政的美国“专家”和美国军人。据估计，泰国每年用于供养美国军人和“专家”等方面的费用不少于五亿铢。
    由于接受了这笔庞大数额的“援助”，泰国必须加紧进行扩军备战。几年来，在这种“援助”下，泰国当局大规模地修建了许多军事基地、机场、战略公路和兵营。泰国的陆海空军兵力已扩充至十一万六千人。另外，泰国还有五万名警察，将来还准备在美国的援助下，把武装部队扩充至二十万人。显然这种“援助”，只有使泰国永远在扩军备战的道路上疲于奔命，使泰国的经济困难日益陷入不可救药的境地。
    人民生活苦不堪言
    追随美国扩军备战和接受“美援”的结果，泰国经济危机日益严重，人民生活非常困苦。几年来，泰国物价不断上涨，人民生活水平日益降低。泰国是产米的国家，但近两年来，连国内食米的价格也上涨很多。1957年6月每公斤大米售价十五点七铢，到1958年6月已涨至二十铢，1958年10月又涨至二十二铢，即比1957年6月上涨了40％。生活费用逐年提高，以曼谷地区来说，1953年生活指数为一百，1958年10月就已经提高到一三二。在米珠薪桂的情况下，广大劳动人民的收入又在不断减少。1958年每个农民的货币收入比1957年减少了55％。锡矿工人，不仅有大批人失业，而且在业工人的工资也被削减了20％—30％。低级公务员的收入也远赶不上物价的增涨。从1941年到1958年生活指数提高了十九倍，而低级公务员的收入，按照提高的生活指数计算却减少了42％。泰国政府加给泰国人民的税务负担也是异常沉重的。根据“亚洲及远东经济委员会”的资料，最近几年来，泰国的税收总额增加了十亿铢，从1953年的三十六亿一千二百万铢增加到1957年的四十六亿五千三百万铢。1958年初，泰国政府又决定再次增加税收15％—20％。据估计，泰国人民每年的税务负担约占收入的11％—12％。目前，泰国人民生活在水深火热的痛苦深渊，饿死和逃荒的现象屡见不鲜。最近泰国卫生部常务次长銮屏博透露，近几年来，泰国精神病患者不断增加。他承认人民生活困苦，谋生不易和生活费用日益上涨等是造成精神病患者不断增加的原因。泰国居民差不多完全得不到医疗上的照顾。泰国有三分之一左右的居民，即六百五十万人患着疟疾，有一百二十万人患着特殊的皮肤病。据泰国防痨局主任乃努丹·塞亚拜今年3月9日向报界发表的数字，在泰国首都曼谷一百五十万人口中有七万五千余人患肺病，平均每二十人中即有一个肺病患者。他承认这些患者大部分是贫穷的劳动人民。
                ×　×　×　×
    从上面这些事实，可以清楚地看到，泰国当局追随美国的政策，是根本不符合泰国民族利益的。几年来，泰国广大人士不断地谴责这种政策，要求泰国摆脱美国的束缚、退出东南亚条约集团和发展民族经济、提高人民生活。这种要求完全是正当的。假如泰国当局继续无视这种要求，将越来越陷于孤立境地，而自食恶果。
