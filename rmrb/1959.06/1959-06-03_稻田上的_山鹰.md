    “Mountain Eagle” on the Rice Paddy
    The inky night sky was suddenly torn by lightning, and a rainstorm arrived. At this moment of thunder and lightning, on the Dongjiang field of the Datang Brigade, Majian Commune, Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, an old man wearing a bamboo hat and a raincoat was darting through the fields like a strong mountain eagle. Braving the wind and rain, he was blocking the gaps in the rice paddies along the ditches eroded by mountain torrents. Although the man was old, he was very agile. In a short time, he blocked all the gaps in the rice fields of the entire Dongjiang field. Then he ran to the nearby rice fields and blocked all the inlets, rescuing other people's rice seedlings, and only went home after the wind and rain subsided slightly. This old man is Chen Xianzeng, the field manager of the Datang Production Team, known as "Old Mountain Eagle" by the people.
    From the beginning of transplanting, the Datang Production Team implemented a field management responsibility system. Uncle Xianzeng, who has many years of production experience, was elected by the members as the person in charge of field management – the field manager. Although 55-year-old Uncle Xianzeng has rich production experience, he thought of the continuous innovation of cultivation techniques in recent years, and the members' vigorous enthusiasm for demanding increased production, sometimes thinking about the rice seedlings in the fields even when eating and sleeping. Like a mountain eagle, he turned around in the fields all day long, carefully managing the rice seedlings. He would not easily let go of even a single clump of rice that had problems. One morning, a shepherd boy was careless and a clump of seedlings was trampled by a cow. After seeing it, Uncle Xianzeng patiently told him, "Planting one more clump of rice can buy a basket," if a clump is trampled by a cow, the collective will have one less handful of grain. Under the guidance of Uncle Xianzeng, the shepherd boy took very good care of the cows. Sometimes, if a clump was accidentally trampled, it would be replanted immediately.
    The rice fields in Datangxia and Dongjiang areas have generally been weeded twice, and the rice seedlings are growing very fast, especially the fields near the village, where the rice is growing like a rooster's tail, thick and tender. People passing by all praise it. But Uncle Xianzeng was worried about lodging in the early stages, and took the initiative to discuss with the cadres to apply more farmyard manure to make the rice stalks stronger. In a large area of land, the growth of rice seedlings is always uneven. Not a single mu of the more than 170 mu of rice fields managed by Uncle Xianzeng could escape his eyes. A few days ago, in the fields along the mountain, it was found that more than ten mu of rice were growing slowly and the leaves were yellow because too much running water had washed away the fertilizer. After Uncle Xianzeng and the members of the small team studied it, the next day he and the members went up the mountain to cut more than 120 loads of green grass and spread a thick layer in these fields, like making a bed for a child. In a few days, these rice seedlings took off their yellow clothes and put on green robes. Under their careful cultivation and management, the rice in this team is growing very vigorously. In order to promote their management experience, the commune recently held a field management on-site meeting in the Datang Production Team. Uncle Xianzeng's spirit of being serious and responsible in managing rice has been praised by everyone.

    稻田上的“山鹰”
    黑漆漆的夜幕突然被闪电划破，暴风雨来了。在这雷雨交加的时刻，浙江兰溪县马涧公社大塘大队的东江畈上，却有一个头戴笠帽，身穿蓑衣的老人，像只坚强的山鹰一样，飞舞在田间。他顶风冒雨，沿着被山水冲起的水沟，在一丘丘的田里堵塞缺口。这人年纪虽老，手脚非常轻快，只有片刻的工夫，就把整个东江畈上的水稻田缺口全部堵好。接着他又跑到邻近的稻田里，把进水口一一堵好，抢救别人的稻苗，一直到风雨稍停才回家。这老人，就是大塘生产队被人们称为“老山鹰”的田长陈贤增。
    从插秧开始，大塘生产队就推行田间管理责任制。富有多年生产经验的贤增伯，就被社员们推选为田间管理负责人——田长。五十五岁的贤增伯，虽有丰富的生产经验，可是当他想到近几年来耕作技术的不断革新，社员们积极要求超产的冲天干劲，有时连吃饭睡觉都在惦记着田畈里的稻苗。他同山鹰一样，一天到晚在田畈里转来转去，细心地管理着稻苗。那怕一丛稻出毛病，也不轻易放过。一天早晨，牧童不留意，禾苗被牛踏了一丛，贤增伯看到后，耐心地告诉他说：“多插一丛禾，能买一只箩”，给牛踏了一丛，社里就要少收入一把谷子。牧童在贤增伯的教导下，把牛看管的非常好，有时偶尔踏了一丛，就马上补种上。
    大塘下和东江畈一带的水稻田，普遍耘过二趟，稻苗长得很快，特别是靠近村边的田，稻长得像公鸡尾巴一样，又粗又嫩。路过的人无不称赞。而贤增伯却担心早期倒伏，主动和干部商量增施厩肥，使稻秆硬起来。在大面积的土地上，稻苗生长总有参差不齐的。贤增伯看管的一百七十多亩水稻田，一亩也逃不过他的眼睛。前几天，在山沿边的田里，发现有十来亩水稻由于活水流得过多，肥料被冲掉，因而生长不快，叶子发黄。贤增伯和小队里社员们研究后，第二天他和社员们一起上山割了一百二十多担青草，像给孩子铺床一样，在这些田里铺上厚厚一层。不几天，这些稻苗脱下黄衣，穿上了绿袍。在他们精心培育和管理下，这个队的水稻长得非常旺盛。公社为了推广他们的管理经验，最近在大塘生产队开了田间管理现场会议。贤增伯这种认真负责管理水稻的精神，受到了大家的表扬。
