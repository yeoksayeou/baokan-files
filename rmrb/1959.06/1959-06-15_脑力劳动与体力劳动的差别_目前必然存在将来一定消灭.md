The difference between mental and physical labor
Inevitable at Present, Certain to be Eliminated in the Future
Xǔ Zhēngfān

    In the published articles discussing the division of labor between mental and physical labor, a small number of people absolutize this division, believing it to be everlasting and impossible to eliminate even in a communist society. Another small number of people simplify the arduous and complex task of eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor, failing to see the fact that this difference is bound to exist in the socialist stage. Historical materialism tells us that the emergence, development, and elimination of the opposition and difference between mental and physical labor have their objective laws. These laws are constrained by the level of social productive forces and the nature of social relations of production, and are closely related to the development of culture and education. They do not depend on people's subjective wishes. It is impossible to try to permanently preserve the difference between mental and physical labor; it is equally impossible to immediately eliminate this difference under existing conditions. As long as we carefully examine the connections and differences between socialism and communism, we can clearly see that the difference between mental and physical labor is bound to exist in socialist society, and it must be eliminated in communist society.

    We know that socialism is the first stage of communist society, with its own past – originating from capitalist society – and its own future – entering the advanced stage of communism. This situation naturally determines that it will have some remnants of capitalism and some communist sprouts growing. In the issue of the division of labor between mental and physical labor, we can also clearly see this characteristic: certain conditions that inevitably cause differences in a certain period and various factors that will inevitably lead to the elimination of this difference are intertwined, struggling, and dialectically unified.

    In class society, the division of labor between mental and physical labor manifests as the opposition between mental laborers and physical laborers. The economic foundation of this opposition is the exploitation of physical laborers by mental laborers. This opposition is most acute under the capitalist system. The reason is that the widely used machines owned by capitalists do not alleviate the heavy physical labor of workers, but turn them into their own appendages; there, workers who own nothing and sell their labor by the hour have to sacrifice their diverse spiritual and physical abilities and repeat a monotonous and mechanical action for years or even a lifetime in order not to enjoy the "freedom to starve"; there, mental labor becomes the privilege of specialists such as engineers, technicians, and scholars. Science is separated from labor and serves capital.

    The victory of the socialist revolution replaced the capitalist private ownership of the means of production with the socialist public ownership of the means of production. In this way, while smashing the chains of capital on themselves, the proletariat also liberated the intellectuals from the bondage of money, opened up a broad road for them to serve the people, and promoted the gradual elimination of the opposition between mental laborers and physical laborers. However, the elimination of opposition does not mean that the difference between mental and physical labor also disappears. This difference will still exist in socialist society due to the following four reasons.

    First, eliminating illiteracy, popularizing education, and making the working people knowledgeable is by no means an overnight task. In a certain sense, completing this task is even more difficult than realizing the "laborization of intellectuals." This is because: the working people account for the vast majority of the population, and most of the elderly, middle-aged, and even young people who came from the old society cannot enjoy even spare-time education, let alone formal education, due to the heavy labor burden and poverty before liberation. Therefore, they have no culture or a very low level of culture. To change this situation, long-term and multi-faceted efforts are required. It is undeniable that the working people have certain knowledge of production struggle and class struggle, which is an extremely favorable condition for accelerating the intellectualization of the working people, but we should also see that this knowledge cannot be complete. It should also be noted that to eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor and cultivate well-rounded communist new people, it is far from enough to popularize primary or secondary education among the working people, but higher education must be popularized. Without a fairly high level of production and without the flourishing development of cultural and educational undertakings, it is really easy to talk about popularizing higher education and eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor.

    Secondly, it is by no means something that can be achieved with a simple wave of the hand to make intellectuals who are unaccustomed to physical labor, ignorant of agriculture, and deeply poisoned by bourgeois ideology learn and get used to physical labor, thoroughly transform their ideology, and truly achieve laborization. The development of intellectuals cultivated in a class society where mental and physical labor are opposed is also deformed. This is manifested not only in their complete detachment from physical labor and serious detachment from production practice, but also in the narrowness and one-sidedness of their knowledge. The socialist system requires intellectuals to be both red and expert, that is to say, it not only puts forward the task of laborization to them, that is, to break the bourgeois world outlook and outlook on life, establish the communist world outlook and outlook on life, fundamentally change their political stance, closely integrate with workers and peasants, and ultimately merge with workers and peasants; at the same time, it also puts forward the task of further continuing intellectualization to intellectuals, eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology academically, learn production struggle knowledge and class struggle knowledge from workers and peasants, master modern science and culture, and greatly improve their professional level to adapt to the needs of socialist construction and communist construction. It is unimaginable for intellectuals to reach the level of being both laborized and further intellectualized, and become communist laborers with both mental and physical labor without the strong leadership of the Party, without the multi-faceted supervision and assistance of the working people, and without the long-term and unremitting efforts of the intellectuals themselves. Before most intellectuals have completed these glorious and arduous tasks, it is impossible to talk about the elimination of the difference between mental and physical labor.

    Thirdly, it takes a long period of time to thoroughly smash, transform, and overcome a series of systems and viewpoints used by the exploiting classes to consolidate and expand the opposition and difference between mental and physical labor; and it also takes a long period of time to establish and strengthen the system that promotes the combination of mental and physical labor and create more mature experience in this regard. In this process of both breaking and establishing, it will never be smooth sailing. There is not only a struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, but also a struggle between the two methods of less, slower, worse, and more, faster, better, and more economical.

    Finally (and most importantly), when the socialist revolution first wins in some capitalist countries that are not very developed or even very underdeveloped, the productive forces of these countries have not yet developed to the height that Engels said, that is: "...under reasonable division of labor, not only can sufficient goods be produced to meet the massive consumption of all members of society and create abundant reserve storage, but also everyone has ample leisure time to inherit everything of real value from the historically handed down culture – science, art, public life, etc. – and not only inherit it, but also transform all of this from the monopoly of the ruling class into the common property of the whole society and promote its further development." ("On the Housing Question") It is of course impossible to immediately eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor.

    From the above analysis, it can be seen that the difference between mental and physical labor will inevitably exist in socialist society, as Lenin pointed out: only "that fully developed, fully consolidated and formed, fully developed and mature communism" can eliminate this difference ("'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder"). Before the socialist economy and culture have been fully developed, trying to immediately eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor by means of "leveling" is not only unrealistic, but also harmful to the development of economy and culture. This idea and practice is a reflection of petty-bourgeois egalitarianism on this issue and has nothing in common with the communist views of the proletariat.

    While seeing the inevitability of the existence of the difference between mental and physical labor under the socialist system, we should also see the inevitability of the elimination of this difference in communist society, as well as the various favorable conditions that the socialist system has to promote its elimination. Here are a few of the main points to briefly discuss.

    The first is that the socialist relations of production and productive forces are adapted to each other, providing a broad world for productive forces to advance with great leaps. The high-speed development of productive forces lays a material foundation for eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor. Because under the socialist system, the purpose of production is to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. The higher the level of productive forces, the better the living and working conditions of the working people will inevitably be, and the stronger the power to break through the cultural barrier and conquer the scientific fortress. On the other hand, the high-speed development of productive forces itself also constantly puts forward the requirement of eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor. Everyone knows that the production of socialist society, especially communist society, is carried out jointly and in a planned way by the entire society, and is based on a high degree of technology. Therefore, it requires producers to be "comprehensively trained," "have comprehensive knowledge," and "be able to do all things." The highest level of production mode will breed the highest level of people – well-rounded laborers. It is obvious that the great leap forward in production in socialist society has accelerated the process of eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor.

    The second is that in socialist society, the working people are the masters of the country. To fully be the masters of the country, the vast number of workers and peasants must not only turn over politically and economically, but also culturally. If the development of the socialist economy economically determines that the difference between mental and physical labor must and will be eliminated, then the fact that workers and peasants are in power politically puts forward the requirement of eliminating this difference and accelerates its realization. The reason is simple: the power and the means of production are in the hands of the workers and peasants, and of course the workers and peasants will make full use of these extremely favorable conditions to master the culture they urgently need. One of the basic ways for workers and peasants in our country to exercise their power as masters of the country and improve themselves in all aspects in this process is to launch mass movements on all fronts under the leadership of the Party. For example, vigorously carrying out tool reforms and technological revolutions, vigorously developing large-area high-yield fields, vigorously running spare-time cultural and technical schools, vigorously launching creative movements, vigorously developing the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, and so on. The process of development of these movements is the process of continuous improvement of the cultural level, theoretical level, and technical level of the masses. The convergence and improvement of these movements will inevitably form a climax of cultural revolution and technological revolution. The brilliant achievements made in this great climax have made our country take a big step forward on the road to eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor.

    The third is that the leading political party of socialist society is the Communist Party. The ultimate goal of this party is to build a communist society and liberate all mankind. Smashing the state machinery of the bourgeoisie and abolishing the private ownership of capitalist means of production is only the first step in liberating mankind. Many decisive tasks must follow closely, one of which is to help people get rid of the state of deformed development in the past. The policies and policies formulated by the Party for this purpose play a huge role in the struggle to eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor. In our country, the Party attaches great importance to cultivating well-rounded new people and gradually narrowing and even eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor, and has done a lot of creative work in this regard. The Party put forward such a call: "Intellectualization of the working people and laborization of intellectuals," which clearly points out that to eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor, it is not comprehensive to only emphasize the improvement of the cultural and technical level of workers and peasants. At the same time, it is also necessary to emphasize the laborization of intellectuals, that is to say, mental laborers and physical laborers work together and join hands to eliminate the differences between each other. In order to realize the intellectualization of the working people, the Party leads the masses to vigorously carry out the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. In order to realize the laborization of intellectuals, the Party put forward and implemented policies such as sending cadres to lower levels and cadres participating in physical labor. (The implementation of this policy is mainly to overcome the "three styles" and "five airs" among cadres. It cannot be regarded as a perfect form of combining mental and physical labor, but the realization of this policy will undoubtedly promote the early arrival of this combination.) All this is mainly to solve the existing difference between mental and physical labor left over from the old society. In order to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture who are developed in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education, and to not only prevent the expansion and deepening of the original difference between mental and physical labor, but also gradually narrow it until it is eliminated, the Party put forward and implemented the policy of education serving the politics of the proletariat and the combination of education and productive labor. The realization of each of the above-mentioned practices can simultaneously have the effect of benefiting the intellectualization of the working people and the laborization of intellectuals. For example, sending cadres to lower levels has a decisive significance for the transformation of intellectuals, but with the sending of cadres to lower levels, culture goes to the mountains, goes to the countryside, and enters factories, which naturally promotes the intellectualization of the working people. For another example, the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" implemented in factories and enterprises is of great benefit both to the improvement of workers and to the transformation of the ideology of management personnel and technicians. For another example, the result of implementing the Party's education policy and the whole people running education is that there are factories and farms in schools, and there are schools in farms, factories, and communes, or schools are linked with factories and communes, which greatly accelerates the combination of mental and physical labor. Most importantly, the Party timely discovered and vigorously cultivated the social organization of the people's commune. One of the characteristics of the commune is the integration of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and the comprehensive combination of politics, economy, culture, and military affairs. In such a melting pot, it is natural to cultivate people with "abilities developed in all aspects" with half the effort. If we want to gradually eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor, we must earnestly and unreservedly implement the Party's policies in this regard.

    With the development of the socialist economy and culture, the objective conditions for promoting the disappearance of the difference between mental and physical labor will continue to mature. At the same time, the further society moves forward, due to the existence of the difference between mental and physical labor, the various malpractices that hinder the all-round development of people, and thus hinder the further development of production, science, and culture, and hinder the transition of human society to a classless difference, will inevitably be exposed more thoroughly. At that time, people will definitely be more eager to use all the favorable factors brought about by the construction of socialist society to completely eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor. In communist society, the phenomenon of the difference between mental and physical labor has lost all conditions for existence. What will replace this phenomenon will be the universal emergence of communist laborers who combine mental and physical labor and are fully developed.

    脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别
    目前必然存在将来一定消灭
    许征帆
    已经发表的关于脑力劳动和体力劳动分工问题的讨论文章中，有少数人把脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工绝对化，认为这种分工是万古长存的，即使到了共产主义社会也消灭不了；又有一小部分人，把消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别这个艰巨而复杂的任务简单化，看不到社会主义阶段脑力劳动与体力劳动差别必然存在的事实。历史唯物主义告诉我们：脑力劳动与体力劳动的对立和差别的产生、发展和消灭是有其客观规律的，这个规律是受社会生产力的发展水平、社会生产关系的性质所制约的，而且与文化教育的发展状况有着极密切的关系，它不以人们的主观愿望为转移。企图永远保留脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，是办不到的；想在现有的条件下立即消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，同样也是办不到的。只要我们认真地考察一下社会主义与共产主义的联系与区别，那么就可以清楚地看到，脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别在社会主义社会是必然存在的，而在共产主义社会是一定要消灭的。
    我们知道，社会主义是共产主义社会的第一个阶段，它有着自己的过去——脱胎于资本主义社会；有着自己的将来——进入共产主义的高级阶段。这种情况，自然而然地决定在它那里既会有资本主义的某些残余遗留着，又会有若干共产主义萌芽滋长着。在脑力劳动和体力劳动分工这个问题上，我们也可以明显地看到这个特点：造成差别在一定时期必然存在的某些条件与必将导致消灭这种差别的种种因素互相交错着、斗争着、辩证地统一着。
    在阶级社会里，脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工，表现为脑力劳动者与体力劳动者的对立。这种对立的经济基础，是脑力劳动者对体力劳动者的剥削。这种对立在资本主义制度下表现得最为尖锐。原因是：在那里广泛使用着的属于资本家所占有的机器，并没有减轻工人的繁重的体力劳动，反而把他们变成自己的附属物；在那里，一无所有的，按小时出卖自己的劳动力的工人，为了不至于享受“挨饿的自由”，不得不牺牲自己多方面的精神与肉体能力，成年地甚至终生地重复某一单调、机械的动作；在那里脑力劳动成为工程师、技师、学者等专门人员的特权。科学脱离劳动而为资本服务。
    社会主义革命的胜利，生产资料的资本主义私有制被生产资料的社会主义公有制取而代之。这样一来，无产阶级在粉碎自己身上的资本锁链的同时，也把知识分子从金钱的奴役下解放出来，给他们开辟了为人民服务的广阔的道路，促使脑力劳动者与体力劳动者的对立的逐渐消灭。然而对立的消灭却不等于脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别也归于消灭，由于以下四个原因，这种差别在社会主义社会里仍然会存在着。
    首先，扫除文盲、普及教育，使劳动人民知识化，这绝不是一朝一夕之功可以办得到的，在一定的意义上说，完成这个任务，甚至比实现“知识分子的劳动化”要困难得多。这是因为：劳动人民占人口的绝大多数，而他们之中大部分的从旧社会打滚过来的老年人、中年人、甚至青年人，由于解放前的沉重的劳动负担和生活的贫困，连业余教育都享受不了，更不用说什么正规教育，因而根本没有文化或文化水平很低，要改变这种状况，必须经过长期的、多方面的努力；不可否认，劳动人民具有一定的生产斗争知识和阶级斗争知识，这是加速劳动人民知识化的极其有利的条件，但是我们也应看到，这种知识不可能是完整的。还应该注意到这样一点，要消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，培养全面发展的共产主义新人，仅仅在劳动人民之中普及初级的或中等的教育是远远不够的，而必须普及高等教育，没有相当高度的生产水平，没有文化教育事业的繁荣发展，要普及高等教育消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，那真是谈何容易。
    其次，要使四体不勤、五谷不分、中资产阶级思想的毒较深的知识分子学会并习惯于体力劳动，彻底改造思想，真正做到劳动化，也绝不是一举手一投足之劳所实现得了的。在脑力劳动与体力劳动对立的阶级社会中培养出来的知识分子，其发展同样是畸形的。这既表现在他们的活动与体力劳动的完全脱离、与生产实践的严重脱节；也表现在他们所具有的知识的狭隘性和片面性。社会主义制度要求知识分子红透专深，也就是说，不仅仅向他们提出劳动化的任务，即破资产阶级的世界观、人生观，立共产主义的世界观、人生观，根本改变政治立场，紧密地与工农结合并最终地与工农融合起来；同时，也向知识分子提出进一步继续知识化的任务，在学术上兴无灭资，向工农学习生产斗争知识和阶级斗争知识，掌握现代科学文化、大力提高业务水平，以适应社会主义建设与共产主义建设的需要。没有党的坚强领导，没有劳动人民多方面的督促与帮助，没有知识分子自身长期的坚持不懈的努力，知识分子要达到既劳动化又进一步知识化的水平，成为脑力劳动与体力劳动兼备于一身的共产主义劳动者是不可想像的，而在大部分知识分子没有完成这些光荣而艰巨的任务之前，又谈不到脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的消灭。
    再次，彻底地打碎、改造、克服剥削阶级用以巩固和扩大脑力劳动与体力劳动的对立和差别的一系列的制度和观点，需要一段较长的时期；而建立和加强促进脑力劳动和体力劳动的结合的制度并在这方面创造出较成熟的经验，也需要一个较长的时期。在这个既破又立的过程中，绝不会是一帆风顺的，这里既存在着资本主义与社会主义的两条道路的斗争，也存在着少慢差费与多快好省两种方法的斗争的。
    最后（也是最主要的），当社会主义革命首先在某些资本主义不很发达甚至是很不发达的国家取得胜利时，这些国家的生产力还没有发展到像恩格斯所说的这样的高度，即：“……在大家合理分工条件下，不仅生产出充分的物品来满足一切社会成员的大量消费和造成丰富的后备储藏，而且使每个人都有充分的闲暇时间，可以从历史上留传下来的文化——科学、艺术、公共生活方式等等——中间承受一切真正有价值的东西，并且不仅承受而已，还要把这一切从统治阶级的独占品变成全社会的公有物，促使其进一步的发展。”（“论住宅问题”）当然谈不到马上消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别。
    从上面的分析可以看出，社会主义社会不可避免地会存在着脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，正如列宁所指出的：只有“那完全发展的、完全巩固和形成的、完全开展和成熟的共产主义”才有可能消灭这种差别（“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）。在社会主义经济与文化还没有得到充分发展之前，就想用“拉平”的办法，立刻消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，这不仅不切合实际，而且对经济与文化的发展有害。这种想法与做法，是小资产阶级平均主义在这个问题上的反映，与无产阶级的共产主义观点毫无共同之处。
    在看到社会主义制度下脑力劳动和体力劳动差别存在的不可避免性的同时，还应该看到这种差别在共产主义社会中消灭的必然性，以及社会主义制度所具有的促进其消灭的各种有利条件。这里挑主要的几条简略地谈一谈。
    头一条，社会主义的生产关系和生产力是适应的，它给生产力提供了能以大跃进的步伐前进的广阔天地。生产力高速度的发展，一面给消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别打下物质基础。因为在社会主义制度下，生产的目的，就是为了保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。生产力的水平越高，劳动人民的生活条件与劳动条件必然越好，突破文化关、攻克科学堡垒的力量就越来越强。另一面，生产力高速度发展本身，也不断地提出消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的要求。谁都知道，社会主义社会、尤其是共产主义社会的生产是由整个社会共同地有计划地进行的，是建立在高度的技术基础上的，因此要求生产者必须是“受有全面训练的”、“具有全面知识的”、“能够作所有一切事情的”人。最高级的生产方式将孕育出最高级的人——全面发展的劳动者。很明显的，社会主义社会生产的大跃进，加速了消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的过程。
    第二条，在社会主义社会里，当家做主的是劳动人民。要百分之百地当起家做了主，广大工农除了在政治上、经济上翻身之外，还必须在文化上翻身。如果说，社会主义经济的发展从经济上决定了脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别必须而且必定消灭的话，那么，工农坐天下这一点，又从政治上提出消灭这种差别的要求并加速其实现。道理很简单，政权、生产资料在工农手心，工农当然要充分运用这些极为有利的条件去掌握自己迫切需要的文化。在我国工农执行当家做主的权力并在这个过程中从各方面提高自己的基本方式之一，是在党的领导下在各条战线上大搞群众运动。举些例子说，大闹工具改革和技术革命、大搞大面积丰产田、大办业余文化技术学校、大搞创作运动、大力开展马克思列宁主义理论学习等等。这些运动发展的过程，就是群众文化水平、理论水平、技术水平不断提高的过程，这些运动的汇合与提高，必定形成文化革命、技术革命的高潮，在这伟大的高潮中所取得的辉煌灿烂的成就，都使得我国在消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的道路上迈进了一大步。
    第三条，社会主义社会的领导政党是共产党，这个党的最终目的是建设共产主义社会、解放全人类。打碎资产阶级的国家机器和废除资本主义生产资料的私有制，这只是解放人类的第一步，紧跟着还得做很多有决定意义的工作，其中重要的一项，就是帮助人们摆脱过去那种畸形发展的状态，党为此而制定的方针政策，在消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的斗争中起着巨大的作用。在我国，党对培养全面发展的新人、逐步缩小以至于消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别十分重视，在这方面做了许多创造性的工作。党提出这样的号召：“劳动人民知识化、知识分子劳动化”，这就明确地指出，要消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，仅仅强调工农提高文化技术水平是不全面的，与此同时还需要强调知识分子的劳动化问题，这就是说，脑力劳动者与体力劳动者共同努力，携起手来消灭彼此间的差别。为了实现劳动人民知识化，党领导群众大搞技术革命与文化革命。为了实现知识分子劳动化，党提出并执行了干部下放、干部参加体力劳动等政策。（这个政策的实施，主要是为了克服干部中的“三风”、“五气”，不能把它当作脑力劳动与体力劳动结合的完满的形式来看待，但是实现这一政策，毫无疑问是会促进这种结合的早日到来。）这一切主要是为了解决旧社会遗留下来的、现存的脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别问题。为了培养德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展的有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者，并做到不但防止原有的脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的扩大和加深，而且逐步缩小它以至于消灭它，党提出并贯彻执行了教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。上述这些做法中的每种做法的实现，都能同时并收有利于劳动人民知识化和知识分子劳动化之效。例如，干部下放对知识分子的改造有着决定性的意义，但是随着干部下放，文化上山、下乡、进厂，自然对劳动人民知识化起着促进作用。又如，工厂企业里实行的“两参一改三结合”，无论是对提高工人来说或对改造管理人员、技术人员的思想来说，都有极大的好处。再如，贯彻了党的教育方针，全民办教育的结果，是学校里头有工厂、农场，农场、工厂、公社之中有学校，或学校与工厂、公社之间挂钩，大大地加速了脑力劳动与体力劳动的结合。最重要的是，党及时地发现并大力地培育了人民公社这种社会组织。公社的特点之一是工农商学兵五位一体，政治、经济、文化、军事全面结合，在这样的熔炉里，自然可以事半功倍地培养出“具有各方面都发展了的能力”的人。我们想逐步地消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，就必须认真地、毫不打折扣地执行党在这方面的方针政策。
    随着社会主义经济文化的发展，促进脑力劳动与体力劳动差别归于消灭的客观条件将不断趋于成熟。同时，社会越往前迈进，由于脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的存在因而妨碍了人的全面发展，并由此而妨碍了生产、科学、文化的进一步发展，妨碍人类社会向无阶级差别的过渡的种种弊病，必然暴露得更彻底，那时，人们一定会更迫切要求运用建成社会主义社会所带来的一切有利因素，彻底去消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别。在共产主义社会里，脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的现象已失去了一切存在的条件，代替这种现象而出现的将是脑力劳动与体力劳动结合、全面发展的共产主义劳动者普遍出现。
