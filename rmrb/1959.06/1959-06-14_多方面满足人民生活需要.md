Meeting the People's Needs in Many Ways
By Our Staff Commentator

Daily necessities are the odds and ends people need in their daily lives: pots, bowls, spoons, chopsticks, baskets, dustpans, brooms, winnows, umbrellas, fans, straw hats, sleeping mats, as well as jars, pots, washboards, cutting boards, pot brushes, scrub brushes, and other miscellaneous items. The vast majority of these items are handicrafts and rural sideline products, with a wide variety, diverse styles, and scattered and piecemeal production, but they are very closely related to people's lives.

With the leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for various daily necessities is increasing. Since last winter and this spring, although the production of some daily necessities has developed under the leadership and attention of Party committees at all levels, some daily necessities, especially many "small items," still cannot meet the needs of the market. Therefore, actively developing the production of various daily necessities, organizing exchanges in a planned way, and trying to meet the needs of the people's lives as much as possible are problems that cannot be ignored in the current economic life.

Experience in various places has proven that to develop the production of daily necessities, we must first give full play to the original material and technical conditions in various places. Daily necessities are an important part of China's abundant local and special products, with a very wide production range. Each region has one, two, or even several special products with relatively large output and well-known reputation. These products have always had a mutually regulatory supply and marketing relationship within the county, the province, and even the whole country. For example, the local paper and umbrellas of Wenzhou, Zhejiang, the porcelain of Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, the sunflower fans of Xinhui, Guangdong, and the straw braid of Yexian, Shandong, and Qingfeng and Nanle, Henan, have a long history and are well-known throughout the country. However, during the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production last year, some areas had some handicraft industries that changed their line of work, and some sideline production temporarily stopped. Some of them have not fully resumed production to this day. This not only affects the supply of local people's daily needs, but also affects the support for other places. These local and special products that have temporarily stopped production should be quickly restored by all localities. The original production equipment and technical personnel should be returned to their posts as much as possible, and the supply of raw materials should be done well.

In order to develop the production of daily necessities, all localities should strengthen technical cooperation and make full use of local materials. In our country, wood, bamboo, willow, rattan, grass and other resources are extremely rich, and these things are the main raw materials for manufacturing daily necessities. At the same time, the equipment and technology for manufacturing daily necessities are relatively simple, easy to handle and easy to learn. However, in the past, the production technology conditions and technical level in some areas were poor, and although there were abundant resources, they could not be fully utilized. In order to expand the production of daily necessities, it is necessary to organize technical exchanges between regions, and adopt methods such as inviting people to teach, sending people to learn, exchanging information, and running technical training classes to jointly develop production. Not only should there be cooperation between provinces, but also between counties, between communes, and between production teams. This is an important measure to promote the production of daily necessities.

To increase the production of daily necessities, we must grasp both large and small quantities. Daily necessities have a wide range, with more than a thousand varieties. Among these products, some are produced in a relatively concentrated manner and are suitable for collective management; some are produced in a very piecemeal manner, and in the past, they were mostly farmers' household sideline businesses, which are not convenient for collective production. Therefore, in addition to the large-scale and concentrated production that should be organized by communes, management areas, or production teams to establish specialized production teams (groups) to organize production separately, we must also, in the spirit of "large collective, small freedom, overall planning, and comprehensive development," give play to the enthusiasm of the masses of commune members to run individually, and develop the production of various scattered daily necessities. In the organization of production, we should also pay attention to reasonably giving labor remuneration according to the principle of distribution according to work and exchange at equal value, in order to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for producing daily necessities.

In order to expand the purchase of daily necessities, commercial departments in various places should, according to the needs of the country and the market, widely sign production and sales contracts with handicraft production cooperatives and people's communes and production teams through materials exchange meetings, and quickly implement the contracts and agreements to factories, teams, and people to ensure that production, purchase, and transfer tasks are completed on schedule. In addition to the materials that are centrally managed by the state, the commercial departments in various places must complete the transfer tasks in a timely manner in accordance with the state plan, and must also proceed from the overall situation for other materials, restore the original reasonable supply and marketing relationship, establish necessary new cooperative relationships, exchange what they have for what they do not have, support each other, and strictly implement the supply and marketing contracts. It is particularly worth mentioning that in order to actively organize rural material exchanges and promote commodity circulation, all localities should seize the opportunity to hold material exchange meetings at all levels. For the small-scale products that the broad masses of commune members produce using their spare time and holidays and cannot be included in the contract, as well as the third category of materials that are mutually adjusted between communes and communes, teams and teams, and commune members and commune members, we should restore and prosper rural fairs with leadership and planning, and organize exchanges in such fairs.

    多方面满足人民生活需要
    本报评论员
    日用杂品，是人民日常生活需用的一些锅、碗、勺、筷、筐子、篮子、扫帚、箥箕、雨伞、扇子、草帽、凉席以及坛坛、罐罐、搓板、菜板、炊帚、刷子等杂七杂八的东西。这些东西，绝大部分是手工业和农村副业产品，品种繁多，式样各异，生产分散零星，但是和人民生活的关系非常密切。
    随着工农业生产的跃进，人民生活水平的提高，对各种日用杂品的需要量越来越大了。去冬今春以来，虽然在各级党委的领导和重视下，有些日用杂品的生产有了发展，但是市场上有些日用杂品特别是许多“小东西”，仍然不能满足需要。因此，积极发展各种日用杂品的生产，有计划地组织交流，尽量满足人民生活上的需要，是当前经济生活中不可忽视的问题。
    各地的经验证明：发展日用杂品生产，首先应该充分发挥各地原有的物质和技术条件。日用杂品是我国丰富土特产品中的一个重要部分，生产面很广，每个地区都有一种、两种以至数种产量比较大的、有名的特产。这些产品，在县内、省内以至全国范围内，历来就有互相调剂的供销关系。例如浙江温州的土纸和雨伞，江西景德镇的瓷器，广东新会的葵扇，山东掖县、河南清丰、南乐的草帽辫等，都是历史悠久，闻名全国的。但是，在去年工农业生产大跃进中，有些地区有部分手工业改行了，有些副业生产暂时停顿了，有的到现在还没有全部恢复生产。这样不但影响了对当地人民生活需要的供应，而且也影响到对外地的支援。这些暂时停止生产的土特产品，各地应该迅速恢复起来，应该尽可能地让原有的生产设备和技术人员归队，并且做好原料供应工作。
    为了发展日用杂品的生产，各地应该加强技术协作，充分利用当地材料。在我国，木、竹、柳、藤、草等资源极其丰富，这些东西都是制造日用杂品的主要原料。同时制造日用杂品的设备和技术都比较简单，容易办也容易学。但是，过去有些地区的生产技术条件和技术水平较差，虽然有丰富的资源，却没能充分利用。为了扩大日用杂品的生产，需要组织地区之间的技术交流，采取请人来教，派人去学，交换资料，开办技术训练班等方法，共同发展生产。不但省与省之间要协作，而且县与县之间、公社与公社之间、生产队与生产队之间也应该协作。这是促进日用杂品生产的一项重要措施。
    增产日用杂品，既要抓大宗的、又要抓小宗的，日用杂品范围很广，品种达千种以上。在这些产品中，有的生产比较集中，适于集体经营；有的生产很零星，以往多是农民的家庭副业，不便于集体生产。因此，除对大宗的、生产较集中的应由公社、管理区或生产队建立专业生产队（组）分别组织生产外，还必须本着“大集体、小自由、统筹兼顾、全面发展”的精神，发挥社员群众个体经营的积极性，发展各种零星日用杂品的生产。在组织生产中，还应注意根据按劳分配和等价交换的原则，合理地给予劳动报酬，以鼓励农民生产日用杂品的积极性。
    为了扩大收购日用杂品，各地商业部门应该根据国家和市场需要，通过物资交流会，同手工业生产社和人民公社、生产队广泛签订产销合同，并将合同和协议，迅速落实到厂、到队、到人，以保证生产、收购和调拨任务按期实现。各地商业部门除对国家集中管理的物资，必须按照国家计划及时完成调拨任务外，对其他物资也必须从全局出发，恢复原有的合理的供销关系，建立必要的新的协作关系，互通有无、相互支援，严肃地执行供销合同。特别值得提出的是：为了积极地组织农村物资交流，促进商品流通，各地应抓紧开好各级的物资交流会。对广大社员群众利用工余和假日生产的不可能纳入合同之内的小宗产品，以及公社与公社、队与队、社员与社员之间相互调剂的第三类物资，应有领导有计划地恢复与繁荣农村集市，在这种集市上组织交流。
