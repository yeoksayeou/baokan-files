    Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor
    Liu Mianzhi

    In feudal times, the emperor was inviolable. Even the emperor's name had to be avoided. If a character unfortunately became a "royal taboo," it would cause disability; either a missing arm or a missing leg. Carelessly violating a taboo was a crime and would lead to suffering. When I was a child, Yang Yanlang was changed to Yang Yanzhao, and Xu Shiji could only be called Xu Ji. I never understood why until later, when I understood these conventions.

    As for scolding the emperor, that was unheard of. Of course, when King Wu attacked Zhou, he scolded King Zhou; when Li Zicheng revolted, he scolded the Chongzhen Emperor. But that's a different matter.

    Because the emperor couldn't be scolded, it was satisfying when someone actually did. In Peking Opera, there's a scene where Empress He scolds the court, and people love to watch it. I think it's for the same reason. However, that's just a play. The people want to scold the emperor but can't, so scolding him in a play is a good way to vent their feelings. According to historical records, Emperor Taizu of Song did have an Empress He, a native of Kaifeng, who was very gentle and probably not good at scolding people. Moreover, more importantly, she died early, before Emperor Taizu of Song became emperor. The title of empress was bestowed upon her posthumously, so she couldn't possibly have scolded his uncle, the emperor.

    The one who truly scolded the emperor, and scolded him very satisfyingly, was Hai Rui.

    The "Security Memorial" recorded in Volume 226 of the History of Ming, "Biography of Hai Rui," has been abridged by the historians. For example, the most severe words he used to scold Jiajing: "Now the taxes are higher than usual, everywhere it is like this. Your Majesty is destroying property to worship Buddha, more and more every day, to the point where the family is empty. In these past ten years, it has reached the extreme. The people of the world use your reign title 'Jiajing,' taking the sound of these two characters to say that Jiajing means 'every family is empty,' without any wealth." The historians probably wanted to protect the emperor. If the common people all used the homophones of the reign title to satirize him, that would be no small matter.

    The Ming Shizong had been emperor for a long time, and he was too lazy to manage affairs. He didn't hold court and lived in the West Garden, spending all day worshiping gods, making sacrifices, and writing prayers. These prayers were letters to the gods and had to be written very carefully. Prime Ministers Yan Song and Xu Jie were both favored because they could write prayers well. Politics were extremely corrupt. Officials who offered opinions were either beheaded, dismissed, imprisoned, or exiled, scaring the officials so that no one dared to speak. In the second month of Jiajing forty-five (1566 AD), Hai Rui submitted a "Security Memorial," addressing the problems of the time and questioning the emperor, demanding reform. He said:

    "How do you compare to Emperor Wen of Han? In previous years, you did some good things. But what about these years? You only talk about mystical cultivation and build extravagantly. You haven't held court in over twenty years and are giving out official positions recklessly. You don't even meet with your two sons, people think you are unkind to your children. You kill your subordinates based on suspicion and slander, people think you are unkind to your ministers. You live in the West Garden and don't return to the palace, people think you are unkind to your wife. The result is that officials are greedy and generals are weak, and there are peasant uprisings everywhere. You had this situation at the beginning of your reign, but it wasn't as serious as it is now. Now, although Yan Song has been dismissed, there has been no reform, it is still not a clear and bright world. I think you are far worse than Emperor Wen of Han."

    Jiajing compared himself to Yao, calling himself Yaozhai. Hai Rui said that he was far worse than even Emperor Wen of Han, how could he not be enraged? (He Qiaoyuan, Famous Mountain Collection, Twenty-three, Biography of Lord Zhongjie of Hai). Then he continued:

    "The people of the world have been dissatisfied with you for a long time, all the officials inside and outside the court know it.

    "You are focused on mystical cultivation, only thinking about longevity, your mind is confused. You are overly harsh and decisive, your nature is biased. You are self-righteous, reject criticism, your mistakes are too many. The main thing is making sacrifices, for the sake of longevity. Look at Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, which one is still alive today? Your teacher Tao Zhongwen taught you the methods of longevity, but he is already dead, he couldn't achieve longevity, how can you seek longevity? You say that heaven gives you immortal peaches and pills, that's even more strange. Do peaches and pills walk on their feet? Does heaven hold them in its hands and give them to you?

    "You must know that mystical cultivation is useless, repent sincerely, attend court every day, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the world, wash away the mistakes of decades of ruling, and do some good deeds.

    "The current problem is that the ruler's way is not correct, and the officials' duties are not clear, this is the most important thing in the world, if this is not discussed, what else is there to talk about!"

    Jiajing was furious when he saw this, threw the memorial on the ground, and ordered his attendants to arrest him immediately, not to let him escape. The eunuch Huang Jin said from the side, "I heard that this person knows he will not live, has already said goodbye to his wife, entrusted people to prepare his funeral, and all the servants in his house have run away, he will not escape. This person is known for being upright and has a great reputation. He is honest and incorruptible, does not take a single grain from the government, he is a good official." When Jiajing heard that Hai Rui was not afraid of death, he hesitated. He picked up the memorial again, reading and sighing, unable to make a decision. Several months passed, and he would get angry whenever he thought about it, slamming the table and cursing people. One day, he was angry and beat a palace maid. The palace maid secretly cried and said, "The emperor was scolded by Hai Rui, but he's taking it out on us." Jiajing sent people to secretly investigate if anyone had conspired with Hai Rui to come up with the idea. The officials were afraid of being implicated, and when they saw Hai Rui, they hid on the side. Hai Rui didn't mind and waited at home to be imprisoned.

    Jiajing sometimes said to himself, "This person is truly comparable to Bigan, but I am not King Zhou." He called Hai Rui a beast and did not call Hai Rui's name in his oral statements or written approvals. After being ill for a long time, he became angry and discussed with Prime Minister Xu Jie to pass the throne to the太子, saying, "Hai Rui's words are all correct, but I have been sick for a long time, how can I go to court and handle affairs?" He also said, "It's all my fault, I didn't take care of myself and got this illness. If I could go to court and handle affairs, how could I be scolded by this person?" He ordered Hai Rui to be arrested and imprisoned, and to investigate the instigators. The Ministry of Justice sentenced Hai Rui to death, but it was not approved. Two months later, Jiajing died, and the new emperor ascended the throne, releasing Hai Rui and returning him to his original position as a clerk in the Ministry of Revenue.

    Hai Rui's scolding of the emperor, and the sympathy and support for him, were everywhere. His reputation grew larger and larger. In Wanli fourteen (1586 AD), Hai Rui was impeached. The young scholars Gu Yuncheng, Peng Zung, and Zhu Shouxian defended him, saying in their articles: "Since we were in our teens, we have heard of Hai Rui's name and considered him a great man of the dynasty, admired by all generations, truly someone to be looked up to as if he were in the sky, unattainable by others." This was the evaluation of him by young people at the time. After his death, the people of Nanjing closed the markets. As the funeral boat passed the riverbank, people wearing white clothes and hats lined the banks to send him off. The sacrifices and weeping never ceased for hundreds of miles. This was the evaluation of him by the people at the time.

### 海瑞骂皇帝

    海瑞骂皇帝
    刘勉之
    在封建时代，皇帝是不可侵犯的，连皇帝的名字都要避讳，一个字不幸成为“御讳”，就得闹残废，不是缺胳膊，就得缺腿。不小心犯了讳，就算犯法，要吃苦头。小时候念书，杨延朗改作杨延昭，徐世勣只能叫徐勣，总闹不清，后来才明白，有这些讲究。
    至于骂皇帝，那是没有听说过的。当然，武王伐纣，骂纣王，李自成起义，骂崇祯皇帝，那是另一回事。
    因为皇帝不能骂，真有人骂了，却也痛快。京戏有个贺后骂殿，人们很喜欢看，我看也是这个道理。不过，那是出戏，人民想骂皇帝而不可得，在戏上骂骂，痛快一下，也是好的。据史书，宋太祖确有个贺后，开封人，人很温柔，大概不善于骂人。而且，更重要的是她死得早，宋太祖没有做皇帝以前就死了。皇后是后来追赠的，以此，她并没有可能骂他的小叔皇帝。
    真正骂过皇帝，而又骂得非常之痛快的是海瑞。
    明史卷二百二十六海瑞传所载治安疏，是经过修史的人的删节的，例如他骂嘉靖最厉害的几句话：“如今赋役增于平常，到处如此，陛下破产礼佛，一天比一天厉害，弄到家里光光的，这十几年来闹到极点。天下人民就用你改元的年号‘嘉靖’，取这两个字音说，嘉靖就是家家皆净，没有财用也。”这大概是修史的人要替皇帝回护，万一老百姓都拿年号的同音字来讽刺，那可不是闹着玩儿的呢。
    明世宗作皇帝时间长了，懒得管事，不上朝，住在西苑，成天拜神作斋醮，上青词。青词是给天神写的信，要写得很讲究，宰相严嵩、徐阶都因为会写青词得宠。政治腐败到极点，朝臣中有人提意见的，不是杀头，便是革职，监禁，充军，吓得官儿没人敢说话。海瑞在嘉靖四十五年（公元1566年）二月上治安疏，针对当时的问题，向皇帝提出质问，要求改革。他说：
    “你比汉文帝怎么样？你前些年倒还做些好事。这些年呢，只讲玄修，大兴土木。二十多年不上朝，滥给人官做。跟两个儿子也不见面，人家以为你薄于父子。以猜疑诽谤杀戮臣下，人家以为你薄于君臣。尽住西苑不回宫，人家以为你薄于夫妇。弄得天下吏贪将弱，到处有农民暴动，这种情况，你即位初年也有，但没有这样严重。现在严嵩虽然罢相了，但是没有什么改革，还不是清明世界。我看你不及汉文帝远甚。”
    嘉靖自比为尧，号尧斋，海瑞说他连汉文帝也不及远甚，怎么能不冒火。（何乔远名山藏二十三海忠介公传）接着他又说：
    “天下的人不满意你已经很久了，内外臣工谁都知道。
    “一意玄修，只想长生不老，你的心迷惑了。过于苛断，你的性情偏了。你自以为是，拒绝批评，你的错误太多了。主要的是修醮，为了长生。你看尧、舜、禹、汤、文、武，那个活到现在；你的老师陶仲文教你长生之法，他已经死了，他不能长生，你怎么能求长生呢？你说上天赐你仙桃、药丸，那就更怪了，桃药是用脚走来的吗？是上天用手拿着给你的吗？
      “你要知道玄修无益，憣然悔悟，每天上朝，讲求天下利害，洗数十年君道之误，做些好事才是。
    “目前的问题是君道不正，臣职不明，这是天下第一件大事，这事不说，别的还说什么！”
    嘉靖看了，大怒，把奏本丢在地下，叫左右立刻逮捕，不要让他跑了。宦官黄锦在旁边说：“听说这人自知活不了，已和妻子告别，托人准备后事，家里的佣人都跑光了，不会逃。此人素性刚直，名声很大，居官清廉，不取官家一丝一粟，是个好官呢。”嘉靖一听海瑞不怕死，倒迟疑起来了，又把奏本拣起来，一面读，一面叹气，下不了决心。过了好几个月，想起来就发脾气，拍桌子骂人。有一天发怒打宫婢，宫婢私下哭着说：“皇帝挨了海瑞的骂，却拿我们来出气。”嘉靖又派人私下查访，有谁和海瑞商量出主意，同官的人都怕连累，看到海瑞就躲在一边，海瑞也不以为意，在家等候坐牢。
    嘉靖有时自言自语说：“这人真比得上比干，不过我还不是纣王。”他叫海瑞是畜物，口头上和批文上都不叫海瑞的名字。病久了，又有气，和宰相徐阶商量，要传位给太子，说：“海瑞的话都对，只是我病久，怎么能上朝办事呢？”又说：“都是自己不好，不自爱惜，闹了这场病，要是能上朝办事，怎么会挨这个人的骂。”下令逮捕海瑞下狱，追查主使的人。刑部论处海瑞死刑，也不批复。过了两个月，嘉靖死了，新皇帝即位，才放海瑞出来，仍回原职，作户部主事。
    海瑞大骂皇帝，同情他和支持他的人到处都是，他的名声越来越大了。万历十四年（公元1586）海瑞被人劾奏，青年进士顾允成、彭遵古、诸寿贤替他辩诬申救，文章中说：“臣等自十余岁时，即闻海瑞之名，以为当朝伟人，万代瞻仰，真有望之如在天上，人不能及者。”这是当时青年人对他的评价。死后，南京人民罢市，丧船过江岸，穿白衣冠送葬的夹岸，奠祭拜哭的百里不绝，这是当时人民对他的评价。
