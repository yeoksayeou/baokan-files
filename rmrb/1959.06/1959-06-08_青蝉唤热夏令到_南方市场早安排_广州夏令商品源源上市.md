Guangzhou, June 7th (by our newspaper) The lush green banyan trees resonate with the "chirp chirp" of green cicadas announcing the arrival of summer. The workers of the Guangzhou commercial departments, responsible for preparing living materials for the urban and rural people, are tirelessly striving to supply more and better summer goods for the people.

Before the arrival of summer, they procured various types of calico, silk, undershirts, straw hats, and wooden clogs favored by Guangzhou citizens, both locally and from other areas. The supply of undershirts, suitable for the masses, will reach 115,000 dozens in the second quarter of this year, roughly double that of the same period last year. Moreover, the variety of colors and styles has been increased based on consumer feedback. New knitwear products like "mercerized dot-star lapel" and "lapel rose" outerwear are particularly popular among young people. The variety of seersucker calico, popular among women and children, has also increased compared to last year. Xidi Store, the city's largest, uses this fabric, along with other fabrics and silk, to produce summer clothing that is not only diverse in style but also emphasizes quality. Through the joint efforts of the store and garment factory workers, they have now adopted the method of pre-shrinking the fabric before production, overcoming the past problem of garment deformation after washing, which is well-received by consumers. To promptly supply more clothing to the market, the commercial departments recently, under the instructions of the Municipal People's Committee, centralized forty-five garment factories under their leadership, specializing in processing ready-made clothes for department stores. Commercial workers have also thoughtfully prepared summer sun-shading equipment for the people. At the end of April, the commercial departments allocated 10,000 meters of white cloth to organize the production of more than 1,200 dozens of sun hats and also purchased a large number of beautiful and elegant straw hats and knitted hats from Zhejiang and other places, supplying them to the market in a timely manner.

In the height of summer, the demand for the famous Guangdong wooden clogs greatly increases. The city's commercial department workers are actively organizing production using timber allocated by higher authorities, currently releasing around 5,000 pairs to the market every day.

The commercial departments also considered the increased demand for mosquito nets, prickly heat powder, medicines, etc., due to the improvement of people's living standards, and have sought to expand sources of supply in many ways. The supply of mosquito net cloth alone will increase by one and a half times in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Due to high demand, the existing sewing factories were unable to process them in time, so the commercial departments organized the family members of employees to help with processing. As a result, the city can now release 5,000 mosquito nets to the market every day, basically meeting the needs. Due to the commercial departments' combination of organizing local production and purchasing from other areas, the supply of soap and medicated soap has also gradually increased. The supply of cooling oil, Ten Drops Liquid, and other medicines for summer heat prevention, as well as 666 emulsion and DDT solution for eliminating mosquitoes and flies, is also abundant. The factory producing DDT sprayers, due to timely supply of raw materials from the commercial departments, can produce sprayers in a steady stream. More than 10,000 have already been supplied to the market, and nearly 10,000 more will be available in June.

The herbal tea stalls and numerous cold drinks in the streets and alleys are a characteristic of the Guangzhou market, and the supply this summer has increased compared to last year. At the end of the first quarter, commercial workers ventured into the deep mountains to purchase raw materials. Since April, traditional herbal teas such as Wanglaoji herbal tea, Five-Flower Tea, Codonopsis and Kudzu Soup, and Seven-Star Tea have been launched in large quantities and can now fully meet market needs. In addition, more than 120 supply points have been added in new factories and some bustling areas according to needs. To increase the supply of popsicles, ice cream, and other cold drinks, the City Second Commercial Bureau specially allocated more sugar, with more than 230 tons of sugar for making cold drinks in the second quarter, more than three times that of the same period last year. Other fruits such as pineapples will also be given priority for supply to cold drink shops as raw materials.

Currently, commercial department workers continue to treat the supply of summer goods as an important task and are striving to supply more and better goods in every possible way. (Attached Picture)

    青蝉唤热夏令到　南方市场早安排
    广州夏令商品源源上市
    本报广州7日电　浓绿的榕树上响起了青蝉唤热的“知了”声，南国广州进入了盛夏。为城乡人民准备生活资料的广州市商业部门的职工，他们正在千方百计为人民供应更多更好的夏令商品不懈地努力。
    在夏季到来之前，他们就在本地和外埠采购了各种广州市市民欢迎的花布、丝绸和汗衫背心以及草帽、木屐等。适用于广大人民的汗衫背心，在今年第二季度内将要供应十一万五千打，比去年同期约增加一倍。而且根据消费者的意见，增加了花色品种。如新品种针织品“丝光点星反领”、“反领蔷薇花”外衣等都受到了青年们的喜爱。深受妇女和儿童欢迎的泡泡纱花布的品种也比去年增多了。全市最大的西堤商店用这种布和其他布料或丝绸加工的夏令服装，不仅名目繁多，而且讲究质量。经过商店和缝纫厂职工的一道努力，现在已采取把衣料先下水后制作的方法，克服了过去成衣下水变形的毛病，深受消费者欢迎。为了能够及时供应市场更多的服装，商业部门最近又根据市人委指示，集中了四十五家缝纫工厂，归自己领导，专门为百货商店加工成衣。商业职工们还周到地为人们准备了夏令遮阳的用具。4月底，商业部门便拨出一万公尺白布，组织生产了一千二百多打太阳帽，还从浙江等地采购了大批美观大方的草帽、线帽等，及时供应了市场。
    盛夏，著名的广东木屐，需要量大大增加了，市商业部门职工利用上级拨下的木材，积极组织生产，目前每天投放市场的有五千双左右。
    商业部门还考虑到人民生活提高以后，对蚊帐、痱子粉、医药等需要量增加的情况，曾多方面设法开辟货源，仅蚊帐布，二季度的供应量将可比去年同期增加一倍半；由于需要量大，原有的缝纫厂来不及加工，商业部门就组织了职工家属帮助加工，因此目前全市每天能有五千床蚊帐上市，可以基本上满足需要。由于商业部门采取组织本地生产和外地采购相结合的方法，香皂和药皂的供应量也已陆续增加。夏季防暑用的清凉油、十滴水以及消灭蚊蝇用的六六六乳剂和滴滴涕药水等医药品的货源也都很充足。生产滴滴涕喷筒的工厂由于及时得到商业部门提供的原料，因而能源源生产喷筒，目前已经供应市场一万多个，6月份还能上市近万个。
    街头巷尾的凉茶铺，和众多的冷饮是广州市场的一个特色，而今夏的供应量又比去年增多了。商业职工们在一季末曾远涉深山采购原料，从4月份开始，人们传统饮用的王老吉凉茶、五花茶、生鱼葛菜澜、七星茶等凉茶已大量上市，现在已经能够完全满足市场需要。并且根据需要，还在新工厂和部分闹市增设了一百二十多个供应点。为了增加雪条、雪糕等冷饮品的供应量，市第二商业局特地增拨了糖，第二季制作冷饮的糖有二百三十多吨，为去年同期的三倍多。其他菠萝等水果也将优先供给冷饮店作原料。
    目前，商业部门职工继续把供应夏令商品作为当前的重要工作，并且千方百计为供应得更多更好而努力。（附图片）
