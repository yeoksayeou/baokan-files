Golden wheat is being pulled to the threshing ground by carts of all sizes. The wheat on the threshing ground, every grain represents hard work! From the moment a seed falls to the ground to the growth of such heavy ears of wheat, how much struggle, labor, and effort have people put into it! Deep plowing of the land, careful selection of seeds, meticulous close planting, diverting water for irrigation, cart after cart and load after load of fertilizer, month after month and day after day of careful management, overcoming the reviving stage, the jointing stage, and arriving at the booting stage, while also preventing lodging and pests... Those windy and rainy nights spent draining water, those drought days filled with anxiety, those worries, those hopes, those beads of sweat dripping into the soil, those joys hidden in the heart, how can they be forgotten? Now, the gold is everywhere, and the fruits of two hundred days of labor are about to be in hand, how can people not be especially careful amidst such joy?

Careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, returning every grain to the home, this is the natural desire of the working farmers. In many areas, wheat must be threshed two or three times, and the ground must be clean. They say: a good harvest is not only in the field, but also in the granary. From harvesting, bundling, loading, transporting, threshing, to warehousing, it has to go through many hands. With each hand, just a little bit scattered, and who knows how much grain will be wasted. In a year of great harvest, even these "small scatterings" cannot be taken lightly.

In the past, in some areas, we had many such lessons: a good harvest was already in sight, but because the harvesting work was done carelessly, and there was waste in storage and consumption, the result was that a large harvest turned into a small harvest, how regrettable!

Of course, "learn from experience, grow in wisdom"; where you've stumbled once, you'll be especially careful when you go there again. This year, various places have paid attention to careful harvesting and meticulous threshing from the beginning of the summer harvest. Today's edition publishes the news of the Xiangqiao Commune in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, launching a wheat harvest recovery movement, which is a clear proof of this. The cadres of this commune, together with the masses, calculated the costs: if a few pounds are scattered per mu, how much will the entire commune scatter? The work points for gleaning wheat were also adjusted. The enthusiasm of the commune members was greatly increased, and they recovered more than 790,000 jin of wheat in three days of the blitz, averaging five or six jin of wheat per mu of wheat field. Harvesting and transporting quickly and carefully, striving to reduce losses, is the best policy; if there are losses, immediately organize manpower to pick them up, which is still a good policy. Thresh quickly after harvesting, and strive to thresh cleanly the first time, which is the best policy; if the threshing is not clean, thresh again quickly, which is still a good policy.

To achieve careful harvesting and threshing, the work must first be done meticulously. On the one hand, we must do a good job in ideological education, and on the other hand, we must do a good job in organizational work, establish a responsibility system, and determine reasonable labor remuneration. Facts have proved that these aspects are indispensable.

    丰产还须丰收
    苏宜
    金黄色的小麦，大车小载地往场上拉去。场上丰收麦，粒粒皆辛苦！从一粒种籽落地到长成这般沉甸甸的麦穗，人们为它经过了多少斗争，付出了多少劳动，费尽了多少心机！深翻土地，精选种子，细心密植，引水灌溉，一车车一担担肥料放进去，一月月一天天小心翼翼地管理，闯过返青关、拔节关，到了孕穗关，又要防止倒伏、防止病虫害……。那些风雨之夜在冒雨排涝，那些干旱的日子又是何等焦灼，那些担忧，那些希望，那些滴在土里的汗珠，那些藏在心头的喜悦，难道能够忘记吗。如今，遍地金黄，二百来天的劳动的果实就要到手，人们怎能不在心花怒放中又特别加意小心？
    精收细打，颗粒还家，这是劳动农民自然的愿望。不少地区的麦子总要打两三遍，还要做到地净场光。他们说：不光丰收在地里，还要丰收在仓里。从收割、捆扎、装运、打场、脱粒到入仓，还要经过许多道手。每过一次手，只要稍稍抛散一些，就不知要浪费多少粮食。在大丰收的年景，对这些“小抛撒”也丝毫不可马虎。
    过去，在某些地区，我们有过不少这样的教训：丰收已经在望了，但是，因为收获工作做得粗糙，保管和食用也有浪费，结果，使大丰产成变小丰收，多么可惜！
    当然，“经一事，长一智”；在什么地方跌过一交，再走到哪里就会特别小心。今年各地在夏收中一开始就注意了精收细打。今天本版发表陕西临潼县相桥公社开展麦收复收运动的消息，就是一个明证。这个公社的干部同群众一起算了一笔账：每亩地抛撒几斤，全社要抛撒多少？把拾麦的工分也作了调整。社员们的积极性大为高涨，突击三天就拾回小麦七十九万多斤，平均一亩麦田拾到五六斤小麦。收割、运输中间行动迅速，多加小心，力争少掉落，是上策；有掉落的，就马上组织人力去拾回来，也还算得中策。收回来就快打，第一遍就打得细致，力争收打干净，是上策；打得不净，赶快再打，也还算得中策。
    要做到收打精细，首先要把工作做得精细。一方面要做好思想教育工作，一方面要做好组织工作，建立责任制度，并确定合理的劳动报酬。事实证明，这几方面缺一不可。
