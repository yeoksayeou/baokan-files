(Our Nanchang Dispatch, 8th) While vigorously developing mountainous areas, Jiangxi Province is also vigorously developing commercial networks in remote mountainous areas, greatly promoting the economic development of these areas.

The mountainous areas of Jiangxi, which account for 60% of the province's total area, especially the remote mountainous areas, suffered from a lack of commercial organizations before liberation and in the early post-liberation period. Abundant local and mountain products could not be purchased, and people had to travel down the mountains to buy the means of production and livelihood they needed. At the end of 1957, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party dispatched 50,000 cadres to build mountainous areas, establishing development bases on more than 190 mountain peaks. At the same time, the Jiangxi Provincial Commercial Department dispatched more than 10,000 commercial personnel to remote mountainous areas to establish commercial networks. After more than a year of efforts, 6,100 commercial purchasing and marketing points have now been established in the remote mountainous areas of the province, basically achieving a purchasing and marketing point every five li, a purchasing and marketing store in every commune, and a peddler for every team. More than 20,000 purchasing and sales commercial personnel are active in remote mountainous areas, in addition to more than 10,000 commune commercial sales agents. In order to promote the exchange of materials and activate the mountain economy, the commercial departments have also opened a large number of small fairs and markets in remote mountainous areas, adapting to local conditions. The people in the mountainous areas say that the development of commerce in remote mountainous areas has brought three major benefits: first, it promotes the development of production in mountainous areas; second, it increases the income of people in mountainous areas; and third, bulk materials from mountainous areas support national construction.

In vigorously developing commerce in remote mountainous areas, the Jiangxi commercial departments have conscientiously implemented the policy of "large-scale purchase and large-scale sale," ensuring that whatever is produced is purchased, and whatever quantity is available is purchased. As a result, the abundant local and mountain products of the mountainous areas have been purchased in a timely manner, greatly increasing the income of the people in the mountainous areas and promoting the development of production in the mountainous areas. According to statistics, since 1958, the commercial departments have purchased more than 2,000 varieties of local and mountain products from remote mountainous areas, with a total output value of more than 30 million yuan, increasing the income of the people in the mountainous areas by nearly 100 yuan per person on average.

In order to transport the purchased mountain local and mountain products down the mountains in a timely manner, the commercial departments also allocated more than 2 million yuan to help the people in the mountainous areas dredge 36 rivers, build 480 kilometers of highways and simple roads, and repair more than 1,000 kilometers of folk transportation routes, ensuring that a large number of mountain goods and local products were continuously transported out.

In order to help the people in the mountainous areas develop production, commercial departments at all levels in the province actively organized a large number of means of production and livelihood to be brought into the mountains. In the past year, the commercial departments have allocated more than 3 million yuan to help the mountainous areas open up hundreds of production avenues, build more than 2,000 processing plants and workshops, and supply a large number of fruit tree and vegetable seeds, and local product seeds. At the same time, the commercial departments also signed production and sales contracts with the mountainous areas, and issued 6.39 million yuan of prepaid product deposits to remote mountainous areas to support the people in the mountainous areas to develop the production of local specialties such as wine, tea, shiitake mushrooms, and dried bamboo shoots. The mountainous areas are rich in wild feed. The commercial departments organized more than 10,000 Angora rabbits, more than 2,000 yellow cattle, more than 1,000 Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, and tens of thousands of domestic animals and poultry to go to the mountains to develop animal husbandry in the mountainous areas, and allocated 700,000 yuan to help build pastures and livestock pens, and add equipment. The departments of the Provincial Department of Commerce also organized special guidance groups with engineers and technicians to conduct巡回guidance on production, help solve difficult problems in production, and regularly pass on various advanced production technologies and experiences to the people in the mountainous areas by sending production operation technical materials and inviting them to participate in on-site meetings. Chexing County's Damaoshan area is rich in Yangmei. The commercial department sent technicians to the mountains to guide the local people in using Yangmei to make wine. With the help of the commercial department, two wineries have now been built on Damaoshan, and more than 100 winemaking technicians have been trained. This year, more than 300,000 jin of Yangmei wine has been brewed. The Huanggangshan area produces dried bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, fungus, fruits, wild game, etc. This year, the commercial department allocated 10,000 yuan and transferred a group of technicians to open a non-staple food production demonstration farm in Huanggangshan, and regularly organized local people to visit it, introducing them to technology. The people's communes quickly organized professional teams to vigorously operate non-staple food production. According to statistics for the past three months, the total output value of non-staple food production operated in this area has reached more than 2 million yuan. (Liu Guanghui)

    促进山区生产  活跃山区经济
    江西大办山区商业网
    现在基本做到社社有购销店队队有货郎担
    本报南昌8日电江西省在大力建设山区的同时，大力发展边远山区商业网，大大促进了边远山区经济的发展。
    占全省总面积60％的江西山区，尤其是边远山区，在解放前和解放后初期，由于商业机构少，丰富的土产山货没人收购，人民需要的生产、生活资料，也要跑下山来购买。中共江西省委于1957年底下放五万名干部建设山区，在一百九十多个山头上建立了开发山区的基地；江西省商业部门同时下放一万多名商业工作人员到边远山区建立商业网。经过一年多来的努力，现在全省边远山区已设立了六千一百个商业购销点，基本上做到了五里路有一个购销点，社社有一个购销店，队队有一付货郎担；活跃在边远山区的采购、销售商业人员已达两万多人，另有公社商业代销代购员一万多人。为了促进山区物资交流和活跃山区经济，商业部门还因地制宜地在边远山区开辟了大批小墟小集。山区人民说，边远山区商业的发展带来了三大好处：一是促进山区的生产发展，二是增加山区人民的收入，三是山区大宗物资支援国家建设。
    在大力发展边远山区商业中，江西商业部门认真贯彻了大收大购的方针，做到产什么、收什么，有多少、收多少，因而把山区的丰富的土产山货及时收购了出来，从而大大增加了山区人民的收入，促进了山区生产的发展。根据统计，自1958年以来，商业部门从边远山区收购的土产山货达二千多品种，总产值达三千多万元，使山区人民平均每人增加了近一百元的收入。
    为了及时把收购的山区土产山货运下山来，商业部门还拨出了二百多万元，帮助山区人民疏浚了三十六条河道，修建了四百八十公里的公路和简易公路，整修了一千多公里长的民间运输道，保证了把大量山货土产源源地运了出来。
    为了帮助山区人民发展生产，全省各级商业部门积极组织大量的生产资料和生活资料上山。近一年中，商业部门拨出三百多万元资金帮助山区开辟了数百种生产门路，修建了二千多个加工场坊，并且供应了大批果树和蔬菜种籽、土产种籽。同时，商业部门还通过和山区签订产销合同，向边远山区发放了六百三十九万元的预付产品定金，以扶助山区人民发展造酒和茶叶、香菇、笋干等土特产生产。山区野生饲料丰富，商业部门就组织了一万多只安卡拉兔、两千多头黄牛、一千多只新疆细毛羊及数万只家畜家禽上山，发展山区畜牧业，并且拨出七十万元帮助修建了牧场畜栏，添置设备。省商业厅各部门还组织了有工程师、技术员参加的专门辅导组，巡回指导生产，帮助解决生产中的疑难问题，并通过寄送生产操作技术资料和邀请参加现场会议等办法，经常向山区人民传授各种先进的生产技术和经验。彻兴县大茅山地区盛产杨梅，商业部门就派出技术人员上山指导当地人民利用杨梅酿酒。经过商业部门帮助，现在大茅山上已建成了两个酿酒厂，培养了一百多名酿酒技术人员，今年已酿造了三十多万斤杨梅酒。黄冈山地区出产笋干、香菇、木耳、水果、野禽等。商业部门今年拨出一万元资金并抽调了一批技术人员，在黄冈山开办了一个副食品生产示范场，经常组织当地人民前来参观，向他们介绍技术，各人民公社便迅速组织了专业队大力经营副食品生产。据最近三个月统计，这个地区经营的副食品生产总产值已达二百多万元。　（刘光辉）
