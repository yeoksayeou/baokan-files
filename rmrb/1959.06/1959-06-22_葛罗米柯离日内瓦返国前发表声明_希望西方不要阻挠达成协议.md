"The Foreign Ministers' Conference has decided to temporarily adjourn and will reconvene on July 13th.

On the eve of the adjournment, we put forward proposals which the Soviet government firmly believes are a good basis for reaching an agreement.

We hope that the governments of the three Western countries will take an objective attitude towards our proposals and not create obstacles in the way of reaching an agreement.

I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Swiss government and the Swiss people, as well as to the Geneva authorities, for their warm reception. See you again soon!"
