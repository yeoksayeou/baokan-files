    Interpretation of "Acting According to One's Ability" and "Doing One's Best"
    Liu Zijiu
    When we talk about working methods, there are often two phrases: one is called "Acting According to One's Ability," and the other is called "Doing One's Best." I think that if these two phrases are linked together for understanding and application, they will become a relatively complete set of working methods.
    First, let's talk about "Acting According to One's Ability." The so-called "measure" refers to people's measurement, assessment, and observation of things. It refers to people's observation, analysis, reasoning, and judgment of things, which means understanding, that is, the "knowing" in the common saying "know yourself and your enemy." The so-called "ability" refers to people's subjective and objective strength in work or struggle, which is the "self" and "enemy" mentioned earlier in "know yourself and your enemy." The "doing" here refers to the plans or schemes for the work or struggle that people are about to undertake. The meaning of "Acting According to One's Ability" when these words are put together is that when people formulate work plans or schemes, they must have an in-depth understanding and specific analysis of the subjective and objective strength, and must make judgments and understandings that are in line with or relatively in line with the actual situation, that is, they must achieve "knowing yourself and your enemy." In this way, the work plans or schemes we propose can be based on the correct analysis and judgment of subjective and objective strength, and they are stable, reliable, and confident, and are the result of careful consideration.
    When we talk about "Acting According to One's Ability," on the one hand, we must proceed and imagine from the worst-case scenario, "measuring" all possible unexpected situations, and when "measuring ability," we must also appropriately leave room for contingencies; on the other hand, we must also "measure" all kinds of potential "ability" that can be tapped, so as to avoid committing conservative errors when formulating work plans or schemes. In short, it must be both reliable and active.
    Now let's talk about "Doing One's Best." The so-called "doing" means to fully exert and vigorously tap. The so-called "ability" refers to various favorable and unfavorable conditions on the subjective side, that is, various existing and potential strengths. The "doing" here refers to the measures and energy that people take to implement and complete the established work plans or schemes, that is, to take active and resolute actions. The meaning of "Doing One's Best" when these words are linked together is that when people implement the established work plans or schemes, they must fully exert the existing strength and vigorously tap various potential strength that can be tapped. That is to say, within the scope of possible objective conditions, fully exert subjective initiative, boldly and vigorously strive for the top, burn boats and sink cauldrons, persevere, resolutely overcome various difficulties that may be encountered on the road ahead, never retreat in the face of difficulties, give up halfway, and strive to complete and over fulfill the original work plans or schemes. And we must also know that the most difficult moment in the development process of work and struggle is often the closest to victory. The importance and role of adhering to the last five minutes lies in this.
    When we talk about "Doing One's Best," from a long-term and overall perspective, the potential is unlimited and can never be fully tapped. Things that are unthinkable now may be done in the future. Therefore, we must oppose the conservative thinking that believes that the potential has been fully tapped. At the same time, from an immediate and local perspective, under certain historical conditions, the potential is limited and can be fully tapped. It is by no means that people can do whatever they want. Therefore, we must also oppose the reckless and desperate thinking of doing things regardless of everything.
    "Acting According to One's Ability" is the basis, foundation, and premise of "Doing One's Best," and is the guidance of "Doing One's Best." "Doing One's Best" is the implementation of "Acting According to One's Ability," and is the practice, correction, supplement, and development of "Acting According to One's Ability."
    It must also be pointed out that when we formulate work plans or schemes, although we have fully measured and estimated the subjective and objective strength, due to the limitations of subjective understanding, the contradictions of objective things have not been fully exposed, and other various unpredictable factors have appeared, in the process of "Doing One's Best," we sometimes find that the original "Acting According to One's Ability," that is, the originally formulated work plans or schemes, are partially or even mostly inconsistent with the objective reality. When this situation occurs, we should adapt to changes, make decisive decisions, and modify or supplement the original work plans or schemes partially or even mostly according to the newly discovered situation, so that they are in line with the objective situation. And we must strive to achieve the realization of this new work plan or scheme that is in line with the objective situation. This is completely correct and necessary. We must never "draw a line and make a prison" and use our own formulated work plans or schemes to bind our own hands and feet. This is called "adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes." This is called having the ability to work independently and is also called being good at solving problems "seeking truth from facts."
    In summary, the result of linking "Acting According to One's Ability" and "Doing One's Best" for application is that for every job, especially those major or relatively major jobs, people should not only have a good start, that is, have a relatively proper, reliable, and active work plan or scheme, but also have a good ending, that is, strive for the complete realization of the established work plan or scheme. In this way, people's various social practices gradually become a kind of conscious, automatic, autonomous, and self-reliant action.
    On the issue of "Acting According to One's Ability" and "Doing One's Best," as on other issues, Comrade Mao Zedong is a model for our learning. He has always advocated "not fighting a battle without certainty of success" ("Acting According to One's Ability"), and at the same time, he has strongly advocated fighting the kind of annihilation war that is "resolute, thorough, clean, and completely eliminate" ("Doing One's Best"); he advocated that "all battles and fights with certainty of success ("Acting According to One's Ability") should resolutely conduct decisive battles" ("Doing One's Best").
    In order to achieve the above "Acting According to One's Ability" and "Doing One's Best," and to train ourselves into a person who can "adhere to the truth, correct mistakes," has the ability to work independently, and is good at solving problems "seeking truth from facts," first of all, we must require ourselves to do a good job of investigation and research work at any time, in any place, and when doing anything, to understand the situation realistically rather than emptily, comprehensively rather than one-sidedly, to achieve "knowing yourself and your enemy" and overcome subjectivism; and to achieve practical work, hard work, and doing our best, and never perfunctorily, shirk responsibility, or be lazy.
    Secondly, it is necessary to implement the "nationwide coordination" policy under the unified leadership of the Party. It should be noted that it is fundamentally impossible to formulate all major strategic work plans or schemes without the unified leadership of the Party. All individualistic, departmentalist, decentralist, and localist thoughts and practices can neither truly achieve nor do a good job of "Acting According to One's Ability," let alone truly achieve and do a good job of "Doing One's Best."
    Thirdly, it is necessary to implement the Party's mass line, and to achieve and do a good job of consulting with the masses on everything. It should be noted that one person's knowledge (knowledge and wisdom) is extremely limited. Therefore, when we formulate work plans or schemes, in order to "measure" all aspects of "ability" thoroughly and comprehensively, without missing anything, we must hold a "Zhuge Liang meeting" and consult with the masses to gather wisdom. One person's strength is even more limited. Therefore, when we implement a certain work or struggle plan and scheme, in order to "do" all aspects of "ability," that is, to exert and tap all of them, we must organize, mobilize, and rely on the broad masses of the people.
    In view of the fact that the working method of "Acting According to One's Ability" and "Doing One's Best" is a relatively complete working method, a brief explanation is given based on my limited knowledge.

    “量力为之”和“尽力为之”解
    刘子久
    在我们谈到工作方法的时候，常有这样两句话：一句叫做“量力为之”；一句叫做“尽力为之”。我觉得如果把这两句话联系起来加以理解和运用，那就成为一套比较完整的工作方法。
    先说“量力为之”。所谓“量”就是人们对于事物的测量、衡量、打量，是指人们对于事物的观察、分析、推理、判断，即认识的意思，也就是平常我们所说的“知己知彼”的“知”。所谓“力”就是人们进行工作或斗争的主观力量和客观力量，也就是前边所说的“知己知彼”的“己”和“彼”。这里的“为之”就是指人们将要进行的工作或斗争的计划或方案。把这几个字合在一起的“量力为之”的意思，就是说人们在制定工作计划或方案的时候，对于主客观的力量，必须进行深入地了解，具体地分析，并且要作出符合实际情况或者比较符合实际的判断、认识，也就是说必须作到“知己知彼”。这样就能够使我们提出的工作计划或方案，是建立在对于主客观力量的正确地分析、判断的基础上，都稳妥可靠，都有把握，都是经过了深思熟虑的结果。
    在我们讲“量力为之”的时候，一方面，要从最坏的情况出发和设想，把那些可能发生的意外情况都“量”进去，而且在“量力”的时候，还要适当地留有余地，以备万一；另一方面，也要把那些可能挖掘出来的各种潜“力”都要“量”在内，以免在制定工作计划或方案的时候，犯保守主义的错误。总之是既要可靠，又要积极。
    再说“尽力为之”。所谓“尽”就是要充分地发挥和大力地挖掘的意思。所谓“力”就是主观方面的各种有利条件和不利条件，即各种现有的和潜在的力量。这里“为之”是人们执行和完成既定的工作计划或方案的措施和干劲，即采取积极的坚决的行动。把这几个字联在一起的“尽力为之”的意思，就是说人们去贯彻执行既定的工作计划或方案的时候，必须充分地发挥现有的各种力量，并且大力去挖掘可能挖掘出来的各种潜在力量。也就是说，在客观条件可能的范围内，充分地发挥主观的能动作用，大胆猛干，力争上游，破釜沉舟、百折不挠，坚决地去克服前进的道路上可能遇到的各种困难，决不知难而退，半途而废，力求完成和超额完成原定的工作计划或方案。并且还要晓得，在工作和斗争的发展过程的最困难的时刻，也往往就是最接近胜利的时候，坚持最后五分钟的重要意义和作用，就在于此。
    在我们讲“尽力为之”的时候，从长远、整体来说，潜力是无限的，永远也挖不光的，现在想不到的事情，将来也可能作到，因而，必须反对那种认为潜力挖光的保守主义思想。同时，从眼前、局部来说，在一定的历史条件之下，潜力又是有限的能挖光的，决不是人们想怎样就能怎样，因而又要反对那种不管三七二十一、一味蛮干的拼命主义思想。
    “量力为之”是“尽力为之”的依据、基础和前提，是“尽力为之”的指导。“尽力为之”是“量力为之”的贯彻执行，是“量力为之”的实践、修正、补充和发展。
    还须指出，在我们制定工作计划或方案的时候，虽然对于主观和客观的力量都作了充分地计量与估量，但是由于主观认识的局限性和客观事物的矛盾尚未充分暴露以及其他各种难以预料的因素出现的缘故，在
  “尽力为之”的过程中，有时会发现原来的“量力为之”，即原来制订的工作计划或方案，部分地有时候甚至大部分地是不符合客观实际情况的。当着这种情况出现的时候，就应该随机应变，当机重断，根据新发现的情况，部分地甚至大部分地把原来的工作计划或方案加以修改或补充，使之同客观的情况相符合。并且要努力去争取这种符合客观情况的新的工作计划或方案的实现，这样做是完全正确的和必要的；决不能够也不应该“划地为牢”，用自己制订的工作计划或方案把自己的手足给束缚起来。这就叫做“坚持真理，修正错误”，这就叫做有独当一面的工作能力，也叫做善于“实事求是”地去解决问题。
    综上所述，把“量力为之”和“尽力为之”这两句话联系起来加以运用的结果就是：人们对于每一种工作，特别是那些重大或者比较重大的工作，既要善始，即要有一个比较妥善可靠而又积极的工作计划或方案，又要善终，即力求既定工作计划或方案的完满实现。这样就使人们的各种社会实践活动，逐步地都成为一种自觉、自动、自主、自强的行动。
    在“量力为之”和“尽力为之”这个问题上，也像在其他各种问题上一样，毛泽东同志是我们学习的范模。他历来主张“不打无把握之仗”（“量力为之”），同时，他又极力主张打那种“坚决、彻底、干净、全部消灭之”的歼灭战（“尽力为之”）；他主张“一切有把握的战役和战斗（“量力为之”）应该坚决地进行决战”（“尽力为之”）。
    为了作到上述“量力为之”和“尽力为之”，把自己锻炼成为一个能够“坚持真理，修正错误”，有独当一面的工作能力，善于“实事求是”地解决问题的人，首先，要求自己在任何时候，任何地方，作任何事情的时候，先要作好调查研究工作，切实地而不是空洞地、全面地而不是片面地了解情况，既要作到“知己知彼”，克服主观主义；又要作到实干、苦干、尽心竭力而为之，决不敷衍塞责，拖懒撒滑。
    其次，就是必须在党的统一领导之下，贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的方针。须知一切重大的带有战略性质的工作计划或方案的制定，没有党的统一领导是根本不可能作好的。一切个人主义、本位主义、分散主义、地方主义的思想和作法，既不能真正地作到和作好“量力为之”，更不能真正地作到和作好“尽力为之”。
    第三，就是必须贯彻执行党的群众路线，要作到并且要作好有事和群众商议。须知一个人的见闻（知识与智慧）是极其有限的。因此，在我们制定工作计划或方案的时候，要想把各方面的“力”都能够“量”的周到全面，不至挂一漏万，就非召开“诸葛亮会”和群众商议、集思广益不可。一个人的力量更是有限的，因此，在我们贯彻执行某一工作或斗争的计划和方案的时候，要想把各方面的“力”都能够“尽”，即都能够发挥并且挖掘出来，更非组织、动员和依靠广大群众不可。
    鉴于“量力为之”和“尽力为之”这种工作方法是一种比较完善的工作方法，特就管见所及，为之解。
