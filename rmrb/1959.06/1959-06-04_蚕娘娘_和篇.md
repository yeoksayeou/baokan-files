    "Silkworm Goddess" Rhymes and Response
    Zhao Jiahuai
    After reading Comrade Liang Shangquan's "Silkworm Goddess" nursery rhyme published on page 8 of the People's Daily on May 27th, the second line of the song, "Busy picking mulberry leaves under the sun," is not in line with technical operations from the perspective of us silkworm farmers. According to research and experience, picking mulberry leaves under the sun is not ideal, because besides easily losing moisture, it is also unfavorable for silkworm feeding in terms of nutrients. Therefore, I offer a responding poem. It goes:

	Joyfully read a new nursery rhyme,
	A responding piece from a silkworm farmer.
	Mulberry trees by the slope, mulberry trees by the path,
	Silkworm girls go to pick mulberry leaves.
	Taking advantage of dusk, welcoming the morning dew,
	Before the sun rises, baskets are full of leaves.
	After feeding the silkworms, they dress up again,
	The high sun shines brightly through the window.
	Chatting and laughing they go home,
	On the road they meet a group of little girls
	Carrying bamboo baskets to pick mulberry leaves.
	The older girl tells the little girls with a smile:
	"If you want to pick mulberry leaves, do it in the cool of the morning,
	Don't pick mulberry leaves under the sun,
	Your older sister has learned the silkworm rearing methods,
	I'm telling you to remember it."

    “蚕娘娘”和篇
    赵家骅
    读5月27日人民日报八版刊登的梁上泉同志“蚕娘娘”儿歌一首，歌中第二句，“太阳底下采桑忙”，在我们养蚕人看来是不合技术操作的。根据研究和经验，太阳底下采桑不太好，因为太阳底下采桑除易丧失水份外，在养料方面也不利养蚕。因和诗一首。正是：喜读儿歌一曲新，和篇来自养蚕人。
    坡头桑，陌上桑，
    养蚕姑娘去采桑。
    趁黄昏，迎朝露，
    太阳未出叶满筐。
    喂完蚕，再梳妆，
    高高太阳照满窗。
    说说笑笑回家去，
    路上遇见一群小姑娘
    手提竹篮去采桑。
    大姑娘带笑告诉小姑娘：
    “要采桑，趁早凉，
    太阳底下别采桑，
    姐姐学过养蚕法，
    告诉你们记心上。”
