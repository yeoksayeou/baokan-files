    Egg Island on Qinghai Lake
    Li Ying
    In the western part of Qinghai Lake, about four kilometers from the mouth of the Buha River, there is a small island shaped like a tadpole, about two kilometers long, where birds gather in flocks and bird eggs pile up. The bird eggs are large, some half the size of a goose egg, and small ones are the size of chicken eggs. People have to be especially careful when walking where the bird nests are located, otherwise they will step on the eggs.
    Recently, we traveled by car from Xining to the mouth of the Buha River. As we took a small boat onto Qinghai Lake, a small island in the distance immediately came into view. When we were about one or two hundred meters away from the island, we could vaguely see patches of black and white on the island. When we got closer to the island, we realized that the black and white patches were actually flocks of birds. When they saw people coming, they squawked incessantly, making it difficult for us to hear each other speak. After we landed, the birds flew around in panic, and suddenly, the sky, the lake, and the island were filled with birds. We were surrounded and enveloped by birds.
    The bird nests on the island are connected one after another, and in dense areas, the nests are connected to each other, with bird eggs of various colors piled in each nest. The white large eggs piled in the goose nests, each weighing more than five taels, are larger than goose eggs; the eggs of the fish gull are bean-paste colored with spots, and are similar in size to goose eggs, each weighing more than three taels, two inches six long, and one inch eight in diameter; the eggs of birds such as the brown-headed gull and the cormorant (also called fish eagle) are the same size as chicken eggs, some white and some colored. If the bird eggs on the island were to be eaten by one person per day, it would be enough for one hundred people to eat for more than two years.
    The several kinds of birds on the island are all migratory birds, coming in summer and leaving in winter. Except for geese, whose food is grass and sand, the other kinds of birds mainly eat fish. They live peacefully together on the island, without interfering with each other. Now is the season for laying eggs and hatching chicks. Because no one has been to this small island in the past, and there are no exotic animals on the island to harm them, the environment is very quiet. Moreover, there is grass on the island, and the surrounding fish are abundant. Therefore, they have built their homes on the island. Some used their own feathers to build nests, and some built nests with branches and hay. It seems that they have been living on this island for quite some time. Cormorants build new nests on top of old nests, layer upon layer.
    In the past, local people had gone to the island after it froze in winter, and only saw some broken eggshells and bird feathers, but after the ice thawed in summer, because the lake was very deep and there were no boats on the lake, no one had ever been there in summer. This year, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Commerce established a state-owned fishing ground on Qinghai Lake and manufactured a batch of sailboats to fish on the lake. They went to the island for the first time in mid-May. At that time, there were more birds on the island than there are now. They fired a shot at random and killed eight geese. This time we went, although there were not as many geese as there were then, a comrade fired a shotgun at a flock of fish gulls and killed eleven fish gulls, weighing about thirty catties.
    The Qinghai Provincial Department of Commerce has sent people to the island to collect more than 7,000 goose eggs. The staff of the Qinghai Workstation of the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have caught dozens of goslings hatched from geese to experiment with domestication. The food for this kind of goose is inexpensive, and it only eats grass and sand. Each goose weighs seven or eight catties, the meat is fatty and edible, and the taste is delicious, the goose eggs are large and the egg quality is tender and fine, the goose down can be used to make bedding, and the goose manure is a very good fertilizer. If the experiment of changing from wild to domesticated is successful, the economic value will be very great.

### 青海湖上的蛋岛

    青海湖上的蛋岛
    李瑛
    在青海湖的西部，离布哈河口约四公里的地方，有一个形状像蝌蚪、约二公里长的小岛，上面鸟类成群，鸟蛋成堆。那鸟蛋，大的比鹅蛋还大一半，小的也和鸡蛋一样。鸟窝所在的地方，人们走路要特别小心，不然就踩在蛋上了。
    最近我们乘坐汽车从西宁到达布哈河口。当我们乘小船划入青海湖上时，远处有一小岛立即映入人们的眼帘。在距离小岛约一、二百公尺远时，就隐约看见岛上黑一片，白一片的。待我们靠近岛时，才看清楚那黑一片，白一片的原来都是鸟群。它们见有人来，便呱呱地叫个不停，使我们说话也难听清。我们登岸后，鸟群惊慌乱飞，顿时，天空中，湖面上，小岛上，到处都是鸟群。我们处于鸟群笼罩和包围之中。
    岛上的鸟窝，一片连一片，密的地方是窝连窝，各种鸟窝里堆着各种颜色的鸟蛋。大雁窝里堆着的白色大蛋，每个重五两多，比鹅蛋还大；鱼鸥的蛋，是豆沙色带斑点的，大小和鹅蛋近似，每个重三两多，长二寸六，直径一寸八；中头环和鸬鹚（也叫鱼鹰）等鸟的蛋和鸡蛋一样，有白色的也有花色的。岛上的鸟蛋，如按每人一天吃一个来计算，足够一百人吃二年多。
    岛上的几种鸟，都是候鸟，夏来冬去。除大雁的食物是青草和沙子外，其余几种鸟都是以鱼为主要食物。它们在岛上和平共居，互不干扰。现在正是产卵孵雏季节，由于这个小岛过去没人去，岛上又无异兽伤害它们，环境十分安静。且岛上有草，岛的周围鱼群丰富。所以，它们就在岛上兴建起了家园来了。有的用自己的羽毛筑成了窝，有的用树枝和干草搭起了巢。它们在这个岛上居住，看来年代已不短了。鸬鹚的窝是在旧窝上搭上新窝，一层又一层。
    过去，当地老百姓在冬季结冰后，曾有人去过这个岛上，只看见一些残蛋壳和鸟羽，但在夏天冰解冻后，由于湖水很深，湖上又无船只，所以，夏天从没有人去过。今年，青海省商业厅在青海湖上建立了国营渔场，制造了一批帆船在湖上捕鱼，他们在5月中旬第一次去到岛上。那一次，岛上的鸟比现在还多，他们随便放了一枪，即打死大雁八只。这次我们去，虽然大雁已没有那时多了，但一位同志对着鱼鸥鸟群放了一猎枪，即打了十一只鱼鸥，约合三十来斤。
    青海省商业厅已派人去岛上拾回大雁蛋七千多个。中国科学院动物研究所青海工作站的工作人员，已将大雁孵出的小雁捉了几十只来试验驯养。这种雁的食物价格低廉，只吃青草和沙子等。大雁每只重七、八斤，肉肥可食，味道鲜美，雁蛋大而蛋质嫩细，雁绒可做被褥，雁粪是很好的肥料。如果变野生为家养试验成功，经济价值是很大的。
