Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Vice Chairman Lin Boqu hosted a banquet this evening to welcome all the distinguished guests of the Peruvian Parliamentary Delegation.

At the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere, the hosts and guests gathered to chat and warmly congratulated the growing friendly relations between the two countries' parliaments and peoples.

Vice Chairman Lin Boqu first delivered a speech at the banquet, welcoming the distinguished Peruvian guests from across the Pacific Ocean on behalf of the Chinese people. He said: China and Peru share many common historical experiences, and today we face similar tasks. This naturally creates a deep feeling of mutual sympathy and support between our two peoples. In recent years, the exchanges between our two peoples have overcome various obstacles and made progress. Tonight, we have the opportunity to gather and chat with so many members of the Congress of the Republic of Peru, which will undoubtedly greatly promote mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and Peru.

Vice Chairman Lin Boqu said: The countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean should seek friendship and cooperation with each other, develop economic and cultural relations, and enhance people-to-people contact and exchanges, so that the Pacific Ocean can truly become a peaceful ocean in name and in fact, an ocean filled with the friendship of the people of the coastal countries, and that our countries can all carry out construction in an atmosphere of peace and friendship. Dear friends, let us work together for this noble ideal!

The head of the Peruvian Parliamentary Delegation, Ernesto More, visited our country last year. Tonight, he said he was speaking at the banquet as an old friend of the Chinese people. Commander More said that the Peruvian Parliamentary Delegation received a warm reception full of friendship after arriving in China, which made it difficult for them to express their feelings of gratitude in words. He said that today's China is overcoming various difficulties and building itself into a strong country.

In his speech, Commander More expressed his agreement with Vice Chairman Lin Boqu's view that countries along the Pacific coast should understand and help each other in an atmosphere of friendship. He also said that the delegation's visit to China was not only to visit cities and factories, but also to have extensive contact with people from all walks of life in China. Commander More said enthusiastically, we hope that the friendship we have established with our Chinese friends will be unbreakable.

Commander More finally warmly congratulated China on its prosperity and wished for the eternal consolidation of world peace.

Among those present at the banquet were members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Wang Weizhou, Lu Han, Shi Liang, Chen Shaoxian, Chen Qiyuan, Wu Xinyu, Zhang Su, Shao Lizi, Ji Fang, Hu Zi'ang, Hu Yuzhi, Xu Guangping, Cai Tingkai, Xie Fumin, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs Zhang Xiruo, and Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs Liao Chengzhi, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, Vice Presidents of the China Political Science and Law Society Zhang Zhiran and Zhang Youyu, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade Ji Chaoding, Vice Presidents of the All-China Journalists Association Wang Yunsheng and Mei Yi, and other responsible persons of relevant people's organizations.
