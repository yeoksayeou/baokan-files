Editor's Note:

    "The Party's needs are my first choice," which demonstrates the firm will of the graduating students of Nanchang No. 6 Middle School. Through political and ideological education, they have raised their awareness, overcome the one-sidedness and blindness in the issue of college application aspirations, and clarified the purpose of learning, which is to be able to better participate in socialist construction in the future. Therefore, they are in a cheerful mood and have set off a wave of planned review of their lessons.

    Now, many middle schools across the country, like Nanchang No. 6 Middle School, are also carrying out political and ideological work for graduating students.

    We hope that middle schools in various regions can do the same, guiding students to correctly handle the relationship between personal aspirations and serving the needs of the motherland, and correctly resolve the issues of employment and college application aspirations, so as to enable them to study their lessons diligently and actively prepare for examinations, ensuring that various schools can recruit the students they need and allow the socialist motherland to obtain the outstanding talents it most needs to cultivate.

    做好升学指导
    “党的需要就是我的第一志愿”，这表现了南昌第六中学应届毕业生的坚决意志。他们经过政治思想教育，提高了觉悟，克服了在升学志愿问题上的片面性和盲目性，明确了学习是为了将来能够更好地参加社会主义建设的目的。因此，心情舒畅，掀起一个有计划的复习功课的热潮。
    现在，各地不少中学，也像南昌第六中学一样，正在对应届毕业生作政治思想工作。
    我们希望各地中学都能这样做，指导学生正确处理个人志愿和服从祖国需要的关系、正确解决就业和升学志愿问题，从而使他们认真学习功课，积极准备报考，保证各类学校能够招考到所需要的学生，让社会主义祖国得到最需要培养的优秀人材。
