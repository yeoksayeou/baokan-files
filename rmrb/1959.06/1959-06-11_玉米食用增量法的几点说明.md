Several Explanations on the Corn Consumption Increase Method
Liaoning Provincial Grain Bureau

    1. Why does adopting the corn consumption increase method improve the rice yield?

    After the corn endosperm is soaked in water and boiled, its starch granules expand and split due to the heat, increasing in size and weight. The proteins in the corn also expand and solidify after being soaked and boiled, increasing in volume and weight. In addition, the germ contains fat and some protein. After heat treatment, the fat droplets gather, and the protein solidifies. After grinding, they are fully released, increasing the weight. These weight changes are the result of chemical combination, not just an increase in moisture.

    2. Why does rice made using the corn consumption increase method have a special fragrance?

    After the corn is soaked in water and heat-treated, some of the starch granules are converted into glucose. In addition, the heating and release of fat from the germ and corn oil also emit the inherent aroma of corn. Therefore, it tastes sweet and has the flavor of fresh green corn when eaten.

    3. Why is rice made using the corn consumption increase method more resistant to hunger?

    After corn starch is soaked and boiled, some of it is converted into glucose, which can provide the human body with more heat and nutrition, reducing fatigue and hunger. After the protein is soaked and boiled, some of it becomes solidified protein, and another part is converted into ammonium acid. Protein and ammonium acid have high nutritional value, and the digestion time after eating is longer, which makes it resistant to hunger. The corn germ contains a lot of fat, and fat has a high calorific value, and it digests slowly after eating, so it can resist hunger.

    玉米食用增量法的几点说明
    辽宁省粮食厅
    一、为什么采用玉米食用增量法可以提高出饭率？
    玉米胚乳经过水浸煮沸，其淀粉颗粒受热膨胀、分裂，体形随之扩大，重量增加；玉米中的蛋白质经过水浸煮沸，其颗粒也膨胀、凝固，体积也随之扩大，重量随之增加；另外，胚部含有脂肪和部分蛋白质，经过加热处理后，脂肪油滴集聚起来，蛋白质凝固，经碾磨后，充分游离出来，增加了重量。这些重量的变化，都是化学的化合作用的结果。不单是水分的增加。
    二、为什么采用玉米食用增量法作的饭别有香味？
    玉米经过水浸和热处理后，使淀粉颗粒部分转化为葡萄糖；另外，胚部的脂肪和米仁油的受热游离，也放散出一股玉米固有的芳香味，因此吃时感到有甜味和有新鲜青玉米的滋味。
    三、为什么采用玉米食用增量法作饭抗饿？
    玉米淀粉经过水浸煮沸后，部分转化为葡萄糖，它能供给人体更多量的热量和营养，能使人减少疲劳和抗饿。蛋白质经过水浸煮沸后，一部分变成凝固的蛋白质，另一部分转化为铵基酸，蛋白质和铵基酸，所含的营养价值高，吃后消化时间较长，因之抗饿。玉米胚部含脂肪多，而脂肪发热量高，吃后消化较慢，因之能抗饿。
