The friendship between China and the Soviet Union has now proven to be a bulwark of peace and progress, with a long history. A full understanding of its background will make it clear why the relations between our two countries and peoples have such significant new meaning after China's liberation from imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In fact, the vigorous development of our brotherly relations is one of the most important achievements of our revolution.

It can be said that the close relationship between our two countries in modern times dates back to the beginning of this century. At that time, the Chinese people were on the eve of a new high tide in the struggle to overthrow the imperialism and feudalism that weighed on our backs. It was at this time that the Russian Revolution of 1905 took place, awakening Chinese revolutionaries to carry out similar struggles in China. We also know that Sun Yat-sen's activities and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 aroused Lenin's concern and sympathy.

After the earth-shattering October Socialist Revolution in 1917, the mutual understanding and care between the Soviet and Chinese peoples rapidly increased. The relations between the two countries also underwent fundamental changes. The Soviet Republic abolished all the unequal treaties imposed on China by Tsarist Russia. This deeply impressed the Chinese people, because at that time our country was still suffering from the humiliation of being divided into many "spheres of influence" by the imperialist powers.

However, of decisive importance was that the progressive forces of the two countries could now have direct contact. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: The October Revolution sent the great truth of Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution with a bang. This was reflected in the May Fourth Movement of 1919, which was the starting point of the new democratic revolution led by the working class. The Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1921, and from its inception, it was the leading force in China's struggle to get rid of oppression and strive for freedom. Sun Yat-sen saw the dawn of mankind and the hope for the success of his long struggle for the Chinese people from the example of Russia. This led him to accept the help of the Chinese Communist Party and formulate the new policy of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants.

Only by formulating this program did the Chinese revolution once again gather strength. In 1925, our workers and peasants began to sweep away the reactionary forces across the country. The Soviet people gave us full sympathy and support. When complete victory was in sight, the Chinese Kuomintang betrayed Sun Yat-sen's will and betrayed the revolution, showing that the bourgeoisie could not carry out our anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle to the end. The counter-revolution began to run rampant. Under the white terror, the blood of some of our best sons and daughters cemented the revolutionary unity and friendship of the Soviet and Chinese peoples. Those were agonizing days. However, even in the darkest days, the Soviet Union's encouragement to us never ceased, and the Soviet people's confidence in the indomitable spirit of the Chinese people never wavered. The Soviet people knew that the revolutionary wave in China would surely rise again.

When Japanese militarists invaded our country, European countries and the United States were unwilling to help China (even under the Chiang Kai-shek regime) in the initial years of the war, but the Soviet government gave China airplanes and extremely needed munitions. Thus, from the very beginning, the Soviet Union actively supported the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, persisted in the battle to drive the enemy out of the country. In the last days of World War II, the heroic Soviet Red Army defeated the strongest Japanese army and, together with the Chinese People's Army, ended the Japanese imperialist aggression.

Throughout the subsequent War of Liberation, when the Kuomintang violated the will of the people, relaunched the civil war, and sold out the country to American imperialism in an attempt to save its fate, the Soviet people continued to support our revolutionary cause. When final victory was achieved in 1949, they celebrated with us. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognize the People's Republic of China.

After our country's liberation in 1949, all the obstacles and restrictions previously erected between China and the Soviet Union were discarded at once. Our two countries stood shoulder to shoulder in the world like brothers. This marked an important historical turning point. The cause of human progress, the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, with this new force, began a period that became the decisive factor in the process of human development.

The relationship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, like the relationship between all socialist countries, arises from the socialist nature of our country. There is no private ownership, no national oppression, and no system of exploitation of man by man in our country. Therefore, there are no social classes or groups in our country that seek profits or privileges by attacking other countries, seizing colonies, raw material bases, or markets, or inciting conflicts between nationalities in order to plunder and enslave them. These means are unique to and consistently used by capitalism. It is fundamentally impossible to use such means in the relations between socialist countries or in the relations between socialist countries and any other country, regardless of its social system.

The policy followed by Sino-Soviet relations represents a new and higher type of relationship between countries and between peoples. It is adapted to the new era into which mankind has entered with the emergence of the great Soviet Union and a series of other socialist countries. The characteristics of this new type of relationship are: complete equality between countries; respect for national sovereignty; mutual trust, fraternal cooperation, and mutual benefit; joint actions based on decisions made through mutual consultation based on a common Marxist-Leninist worldview.

Looking back over the past decade, we can see that, by adhering to these principles, the peoples of the Soviet Union and China have become more closely united. They have been able to obtain mutual material and spiritual support, enabling both countries to make great progress under the leadership of the Communist Party.

This idea of international brotherhood, which originates from our proletarian viewpoint, is embodied in the historic Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in February 1950. The Joint Declaration of the Governments of China and the Soviet Union in October 1954 and the Communiqu√© of the talks between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade N.S. Khrushchev in August 1958 reaffirmed this idea. The large-scale economic and technical assistance given by the Soviet Union to China is a concrete manifestation of this idea. This assistance is of extreme importance to the restoration of our national economy and then to the industrialization of our country, which is one of the planned steps towards socialism that we are undertaking. With the increasing expansion of cultural ties between the Soviet and Chinese peoples, this idea has been realized in various ways and through various channels.

For ten years, the Soviet Union and China have spared no effort in strengthening the fraternal ties of the great socialist camp, faithfully adhering to the last-mentioned principle. We have continuously struggled to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, especially in the struggle against the attacks of modern revisionists represented by the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The historic Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the twelve socialist countries in 1957 is the result of this firm stand. This declaration summarizes the experience of the parties of various countries in winning revolutionary victories and building socialism, and is of extreme importance to the world working class movement. As time passes, its role will become more obvious and prominent.

The continuous progress and healthy development of the socialist camp is an achievement of paramount importance. It vividly demonstrates the superiority of the socialist way of life over the capitalist way of life, which limps from crisis to crisis, bringing endless suffering to the working people of those countries. The correctness of the socialist camp in handling relations with other countries, especially its just stance on every issue, makes it an irreconcilable enemy of any form of regression and exploitation. It is the main force in the world today that defends all peoples from infringement, defends the sovereignty of every country, and defends the security of all mankind.

The strength of the socialist camp, combined with the peaceful sentiments of the people of all countries in the world, has made the desire for world peace overwhelm the war desires of a small group of monopoly capitalists in the West. Because of the existence of the socialist camp and the overwhelming peaceful sentiment, we can declare that war is not inevitable; as long as the people of all countries continue to vigorously defend their right to a peaceful life, war as an instrument of aggressive policy can be stopped.

For ten years, the Soviet Union and China have adopted consistent views and positions on every major international issue. We have resolutely opposed imperialist aggression wherever it occurs. We are the consistent, reliable, and faithful friends of every people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialist aggression and attempts at division. We have repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals to resolve every outstanding international issue; faced with the rigid and hostile attitude of the West towards peaceful solutions, we have sincerely sought consultation instead of resorting to force. We are signatories to the peace declaration drafted by the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries in Moscow in 1957. China is one of the founders of the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, which the Soviet Union and China unanimously and unreservedly support. Both of our countries are committed to expanding trade and cultural exchanges between countries in order to enhance mutual understanding and eliminate the possibility of war.

Foreign policy is only a continuation of a country's domestic policy. It is reflected in the character and actions of that country. From the huge plans implemented by the Soviet Union and China, it can be clearly seen that we are seeking peace based on justice between the peoples of all countries, because domestically we are building for the happiness and prosperity of our own people. In keeping with the characteristic spirit of collectivism of our two countries' societies, we are very willing to share our progress with friends around the world to help their countries' independent development.

The Chinese people believe that the path they have taken is the only correct path, and based on ten years of experience, we realize that Sino-Soviet friendship is a fundamental condition for our own continuous progress. It guarantees that we can maintain a high rate of development, create the necessary conditions for the rapid construction of socialism, and then, in a not-too-long historical period, begin the transition from the first stage of communism to the second stage of communism.

Today, our two countries and peoples are stronger and more united than ever before. Our friendship is unbreakable. Together with other socialist countries, we stand at the forefront of all progressive causes. We are fighting for the early victory of socialism over capitalism in peaceful competition. We know that this has the most important impact on the fate of mankind. It heralds the end of the capitalist system and imperialism and shows that more billions of people around the world will soon be liberated from the suffering of oppression, war, and economic turmoil that has constantly plagued them for many centuries.

We Chinese people are proud that our liberation has enabled us to work together with the Soviet people to play this historic role. We once again express that we will unreservedly support the two great communist parties in our two brotherly countries with all our strength. It is these two communist parties that are leading nearly nine hundred million people towards socialism and communism, towards a new era of world peace and progress.„ÄÄMay 15, 1959 (Originally published in Beijing Review, Issue 22)
