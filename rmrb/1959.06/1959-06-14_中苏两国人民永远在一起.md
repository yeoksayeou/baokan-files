The friendship between China and the Soviet Union has now proven to be a bulwark of peace and progress, with a long history. A full understanding of its background will make it clear why the relations between our two countries and peoples have such significant new meaning after China's liberation from imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In fact, the vigorous development of our brotherly relations is one of the most important achievements of our revolution.

It can be said that the close relationship between our two countries in modern times dates back to the beginning of this century. At that time, the Chinese people were on the eve of a new high tide in the struggle to overthrow the imperialism and feudalism that weighed on our backs. It was at this time that the Russian Revolution of 1905 took place, awakening Chinese revolutionaries to carry out similar struggles in China. We also know that Sun Yat-sen's activities and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 aroused Lenin's concern and sympathy.

After the earth-shattering October Socialist Revolution in 1917, the mutual understanding and care between the Soviet and Chinese peoples rapidly increased. The relations between the two countries also underwent fundamental changes. The Soviet Republic abolished all the unequal treaties imposed on China by Tsarist Russia. This deeply impressed the Chinese people, because at that time our country was still suffering from the humiliation of being divided into many "spheres of influence" by the imperialist powers.

However, of decisive importance was that the progressive forces of the two countries could now have direct contact. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: The October Revolution sent the great truth of Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution with a bang. This was reflected in the May Fourth Movement of 1919, which was the starting point of the new democratic revolution led by the working class. The Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1921, and from its inception, it was the leading force in China's struggle to get rid of oppression and strive for freedom. Sun Yat-sen saw the dawn of mankind and the hope for the success of his long struggle for the Chinese people from the example of Russia. This led him to accept the help of the Chinese Communist Party and formulate the new policy of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants.

Only by formulating this program did the Chinese revolution once again gather strength. In 1925, our workers and peasants began to sweep away the reactionary forces across the country. The Soviet people gave us full sympathy and support. When complete victory was in sight, the Chinese Kuomintang betrayed Sun Yat-sen's will and betrayed the revolution, showing that the bourgeoisie could not carry out our anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle to the end. The counter-revolution began to run rampant. Under the white terror, the blood of some of our best sons and daughters cemented the revolutionary unity and friendship of the Soviet and Chinese peoples. Those were agonizing days. However, even in the darkest days, the Soviet Union's encouragement to us never ceased, and the Soviet people's confidence in the indomitable spirit of the Chinese people never wavered. The Soviet people knew that the revolutionary wave in China would surely rise again.

When Japanese militarists invaded our country, European countries and the United States were unwilling to help China (even under the Chiang Kai-shek regime) in the initial years of the war, but the Soviet government gave China airplanes and extremely needed munitions. Thus, from the very beginning, the Soviet Union actively supported the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, persisted in the battle to drive the enemy out of the country. In the last days of World War II, the heroic Soviet Red Army defeated the strongest Japanese army and, together with the Chinese People's Army, ended the Japanese imperialist aggression.

Throughout the subsequent War of Liberation, when the Kuomintang violated the will of the people, relaunched the civil war, and sold out the country to American imperialism in an attempt to save its fate, the Soviet people continued to support our revolutionary cause. When final victory was achieved in 1949, they celebrated with us. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognize the People's Republic of China.

After our country's liberation in 1949, all the obstacles and restrictions previously erected between China and the Soviet Union were discarded at once. Our two countries stood shoulder to shoulder in the world like brothers. This marked an important historical turning point. The cause of human progress, the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, with this new force, began a period that became the decisive factor in the process of human development.

The relationship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, like the relationship between all socialist countries, arises from the socialist nature of our country. There is no private ownership, no national oppression, and no system of exploitation of man by man in our country. Therefore, there are no social classes or groups in our country that seek profits or privileges by attacking other countries, seizing colonies, raw material bases, or markets, or inciting conflicts between nationalities in order to plunder and enslave them. These means are unique to and consistently used by capitalism. It is fundamentally impossible to use such means in the relations between socialist countries or in the relations between socialist countries and any other country, regardless of its social system.

The policy followed by Sino-Soviet relations represents a new and higher type of relationship between countries and between peoples. It is adapted to the new era into which mankind has entered with the emergence of the great Soviet Union and a series of other socialist countries. The characteristics of this new type of relationship are: complete equality between countries; respect for national sovereignty; mutual trust, fraternal cooperation, and mutual benefit; joint actions based on decisions made through mutual consultation based on a common Marxist-Leninist worldview.

Looking back over the past decade, we can see that, by adhering to these principles, the peoples of the Soviet Union and China have become more closely united. They have been able to obtain mutual material and spiritual support, enabling both countries to make great progress under the leadership of the Communist Party.

This idea of international brotherhood, which originates from our proletarian viewpoint, is embodied in the historic Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in February 1950. The Joint Declaration of the Governments of China and the Soviet Union in October 1954 and the Communiqué of the talks between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade N.S. Khrushchev in August 1958 reaffirmed this idea. The large-scale economic and technical assistance given by the Soviet Union to China is a concrete manifestation of this idea. This assistance is of extreme importance to the restoration of our national economy and then to the industrialization of our country, which is one of the planned steps towards socialism that we are undertaking. With the increasing expansion of cultural ties between the Soviet and Chinese peoples, this idea has been realized in various ways and through various channels.

For ten years, the Soviet Union and China have spared no effort in strengthening the fraternal ties of the great socialist camp, faithfully adhering to the last-mentioned principle. We have continuously struggled to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, especially in the struggle against the attacks of modern revisionists represented by the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The historic Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the twelve socialist countries in 1957 is the result of this firm stand. This declaration summarizes the experience of the parties of various countries in winning revolutionary victories and building socialism, and is of extreme importance to the world working class movement. As time passes, its role will become more obvious and prominent.

The continuous progress and healthy development of the socialist camp is an achievement of paramount importance. It vividly demonstrates the superiority of the socialist way of life over the capitalist way of life, which limps from crisis to crisis, bringing endless suffering to the working people of those countries. The correctness of the socialist camp in handling relations with other countries, especially its just stance on every issue, makes it an irreconcilable enemy of any form of regression and exploitation. It is the main force in the world today that defends all peoples from infringement, defends the sovereignty of every country, and defends the security of all mankind.

The strength of the socialist camp, combined with the peaceful sentiments of the people of all countries in the world, has made the desire for world peace overwhelm the war desires of a small group of monopoly capitalists in the West. Because of the existence of the socialist camp and the overwhelming peaceful sentiment, we can declare that war is not inevitable; as long as the people of all countries continue to vigorously defend their right to a peaceful life, war as an instrument of aggressive policy can be stopped.

For ten years, the Soviet Union and China have adopted consistent views and positions on every major international issue. We have resolutely opposed imperialist aggression wherever it occurs. We are the consistent, reliable, and faithful friends of every people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialist aggression and attempts at division. We have repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals to resolve every outstanding international issue; faced with the rigid and hostile attitude of the West towards peaceful solutions, we have sincerely sought consultation instead of resorting to force. We are signatories to the peace declaration drafted by the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries in Moscow in 1957. China is one of the founders of the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, which the Soviet Union and China unanimously and unreservedly support. Both of our countries are committed to expanding trade and cultural exchanges between countries in order to enhance mutual understanding and eliminate the possibility of war.

Foreign policy is only a continuation of a country's domestic policy. It is reflected in the character and actions of that country. From the huge plans implemented by the Soviet Union and China, it can be clearly seen that we are seeking peace based on justice between the peoples of all countries, because domestically we are building for the happiness and prosperity of our own people. In keeping with the characteristic spirit of collectivism of our two countries' societies, we are very willing to share our progress with friends around the world to help their countries' independent development.

The Chinese people believe that the path they have taken is the only correct path, and based on ten years of experience, we realize that Sino-Soviet friendship is a fundamental condition for our own continuous progress. It guarantees that we can maintain a high rate of development, create the necessary conditions for the rapid construction of socialism, and then, in a not-too-long historical period, begin the transition from the first stage of communism to the second stage of communism.

Today, our two countries and peoples are stronger and more united than ever before. Our friendship is unbreakable. Together with other socialist countries, we stand at the forefront of all progressive causes. We are fighting for the early victory of socialism over capitalism in peaceful competition. We know that this has the most important impact on the fate of mankind. It heralds the end of the capitalist system and imperialism and shows that more billions of people around the world will soon be liberated from the suffering of oppression, war, and economic turmoil that has constantly plagued them for many centuries.

We Chinese people are proud that our liberation has enabled us to work together with the Soviet people to play this historic role. We once again express that we will unreservedly support the two great communist parties in our two brotherly countries with all our strength. It is these two communist parties that are leading nearly nine hundred million people towards socialism and communism, towards a new era of world peace and progress.　May 15, 1959 (Originally published in Beijing Review, Issue 22)

    中苏两国人民永远在一起
    宋庆龄
    中苏友谊现在已经证明是和平和进步的堡垒，它有着悠久的历史。充分了解了它的背景，就会明白，为什么在中国从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义下解放出来以后，我们两国和两国人民之间的关系有了这样重大的新的意义。事实上，我们两国兄弟般的关系的蓬勃发展，是我们革命的最重要的成果之一。
    可以说，我们两国在现代的亲密关系要追溯到本世纪之初。那时中国人民正处在推翻压在我们背上的帝国主义和封建主义的斗争新高潮的前夕。正在这时候，1905年的俄国革命发生了，唤醒了中国革命者在中国进行了类似的斗争。我们也知道，孙中山的活动和1911年的中国革命曾经引起列宁的关心和同情。
    1917年翻天复地的十月社会主义革命之后，苏中两国人民的相互了解和关怀有了迅速的增进。两国关系也起了根本的变化。苏维埃共和国废除了沙皇俄国强加于中国的一切不平等条约。这给予中国人民很深的印象，因为当时我国还蒙受着被帝国主义列强瓜分为许多“势力范围”的耻辱。
    然而，具有决定性的重要意义的是，两国的进步力量现在可以进行直接的接触了。正像毛泽东主席所说的：十月革命一声炮响，给中国革命送来了马克思列宁主义的伟大真理。这一点在1919年的五四运动中得到了反映，这个运动是工人阶级领导下的新民主主义革命的起点。中国共产党在1921年成立，它从成立之日起就是中国摆脱压迫、争取自由斗争中的领导力量，孙中山从俄国的榜样中看到了人类的黎明和他为中国人民而进行的长期斗争获得成功的希望。这就引导他接受了中国共产党的帮助，制订了联俄、联共、扶助工农的新政策。
    仅仅由于制订了这个纲领，中国革命就再次积聚了力量，1925年我国的工人和农民开始在全国扫荡反动力量。苏联人民给了我们充分的同情和支持。完全胜利在望的时候，中国国民党背叛了孙中山的遗训，背叛了革命，表明了资产阶级不能够把我们反帝反封建的斗争进行到底。反革命开始猖狂起来，在白色恐怖之下，我们一些最优秀的子女的鲜血凝结了苏中人民革命团结的友谊。那是折磨人心的日子。然而，即使在最黑暗的日子里，苏联对我们的鼓励也一刻都没有停止，苏联人民对中国人民不屈不挠精神的信心也没有动摇。苏联人民知道，中国的革命浪潮是一定会再度升高的。
    当日本军国主义分子进犯我国的时候，欧洲国家和美国都不肯帮助中国（即使是在蒋介石政权底下）在战争最初几年中进行抗日，但是苏联政府却给了中国以飞机和极端需要的军火。这样，从一开始苏联就积极支持了中国人民的抗日斗争。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下坚持了把敌人赶出国土的战斗。在二次世界大战的最后几天里，英勇的苏联红军把日本最强的军队打得落花流水，并且和中国人民军队一道结束了日本帝国主义侵略。
    在以后的整个解放战争时期，当国民党违反民意、重新发动了内战并且把国家出卖给美帝国主义以图挽救自己的厄运的时候，苏联人民继续支持了我们的革命事业。当1949年取得最后胜利的时候，他们和我们一起欢庆。苏联是第一个承认中华人民共和国的国家。
    1949年我国解放之后，以前树立在中苏之间的一切障碍和限制被一古脑儿扔弃了，我们两国有如兄弟一般肩并肩地屹立在世界上。这标志着一个重要的历史转折点。人类进步事业，和平民主和社会主义事业以这种新的力量，成为人类发展进程中的决定性因素的时期开始了。
    苏联和中华人民共和国的关系，和所有社会主义国家之间的关系一样，是从我们国家的社会主义性质中产生的。我们国家里没有私有制，没有民族压迫，没有人剥削人的制度。因此，靠进攻别的国家，强占殖民地、原料基地或市场，煽动民族之间的冲突，以便掠夺和奴役他们，来谋取利润或特权的社会阶级或者集团，在我们国家里是不存在的。他们这些手段，都是资本主义所特有的和一贯使用的手段。在社会主义国家的关系中或者在社会主义国家和任何其它不论具有什么社会制度的国家的关系中，根本不可能使用这种手段。
    中苏关系所遵循的方针代表着国与国之间和各国人民之间的一种新的和更高类型的关系，它适应于随着伟大苏联和一系列旁的社会主义国家的出现，人类所进入的新的时代。这种新型关系的特征是：各国之间完全平等；尊重国家主权；相互信任、兄弟合作和互利；以基于共同的马克思列宁主义世界观互相协商作出的决定为基础的联合行动。
    回顾过去的十年，我们可以看到，由于遵循这些原则，苏中两国人民团结得更加紧密，他们能够互相取得物质的和精神的支援，使两国在共产党的领导下获得巨大的进步。
    这种出自我们无产阶级观点的国际兄弟关系的思想，体现在1950年2月签订的具有历史意义的友好同盟互助条约中。1954年10月中苏两国政府联合宣言和1958年8月毛泽东同志和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的会谈公报，重申了这个思想。苏联给与中国的大规模经济、技术援助是这个思想的具体表现，这种援助对我国国民经济的恢复以及接着对我国正在进行的作为有计划走向社会主义的步骤之一的工业化都有极为重要的意义。随着苏中人民文化联系的日益扩大，这种思想以各种各样的方式，通过多种的途径得到了实现。
    十年来，苏联和中国不遗余力地为加强伟大的社会主义阵营的兄弟般的联系而努力，忠实地遵循了上述的最后一条原则。我们不断进行斗争，维护了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，特别是同以南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导为代表的现代修正主义者的攻击作了斗争。具有历史意义的1957年十二个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党的莫斯科宣言就是这种坚定立场的一个成果。这个宣言总结了各国党在赢得革命胜利和建设社会主义方面的经验，对世界工人阶级运动有着极端重要的意义，随着时间的逝去，它的作用将变得更加明显和突出。
    社会主义阵营的不断进步和健全发展是具有头等重要意义的成就。它生动地显示了社会主义生活方式超过资本主义生活方式的优越性，资本主义跛行着从危机走向危机，给那些国家的劳动人民带来了无穷的困苦。社会主义阵营在处理同其他国家的关系上的正确性，特别是它在每一个问题上所持的公正立场，使它成为任何形式的退步和剥削制度的不调和的敌人。它是今天世界上保卫各国人民不受侵犯、保卫每一个国家的主权和全人类的安全的主要力量。
    社会主义阵营的力量，同全世界各国人民的和平感情相结合，使得要求世界安宁的愿望压倒了西方一小撮垄断资本家的战争欲望。由于存在着社会主义阵营和压倒一切的和平感情，我们可以宣布战争不是不可避免的；只要各国人民继续有力地保卫他们和平生活的权利，作为一种侵略政策工具的战争是可以被制止的。
    十年来，苏中两国在每一个重大的国际问题上都采取了一致的看法和主张。我们坚决地反对了在任何地方出现的帝国主义侵略。我们是每一个亚、非、拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义侵略和分裂企图的斗争的一贯可靠和忠实的朋友。我们一再提出合理的建议来解决每一个悬而未决的国际问题；面对着西方对和平解决的意见所采取的僵硬和敌对的态度，我们诚恳地寻求协商而不诉诸武力。我们是各国共产党和工人党1957年在莫斯科起草的和平宣言的签字者。对于著名的和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则，中国是创始人之一，苏联和中国一致毫无保留地加以支持。我们两国都致力于扩大各国间的贸易和文化来往，以增进彼此的了解和排除战争的可能性。
    外交政策只是一个国家的国内政策的延续，它反映在这个国家的性格和行动中。从苏中两国所实行的巨大计划中，可以明显地看出，我们是寻求着以各国人民间的公道为基础的和平，因为在国内我们正在为本国人民的幸福和繁荣进行着建设。本着我们两国社会集体主义精神的特点，我们很愿意和世界各地的朋友们分享我们的进步，以助于他们本国的独立发展。
    中国人民认为自己所走的道路是唯一正确的道路，而且根据十年来的经验，我们认识到中苏友谊是我们自己不断前进的一个基本条件。它保证我们能够保持高速度的发展，创造迅速建成社会主义的必要条件，然后在一个不太长的历史时期内开始从共产主义的第一阶段过渡到共产主义的第二阶段。
    今天我们两国和两国人民比过去任何时候都更为富强，更为团结了。我们的友谊是牢不可破的。我们和其他的社会主义国家一起，站在一切进步事业的最前列。我们为社会主义早日在和平竞赛中战胜资本主义而奋斗，我们知道这对于人类的命运具有最重大的影响，它预告着资本主义制度和帝国主义的末日，说明了全世界更多的亿万人民即将从许多世纪来不断折磨他们的压迫、战争和经济动荡的苦难中解放出来。
    我们中国人民的解放使我们得以和苏联人民一道来发挥这一历史作用，对此我们感到骄傲。我们再一次表示，我们将毫无保留地以全部力量来支持我们两个兄弟国家中的两个伟大的共产党。正是这两个共产党在领导着将近九亿人民走向社会主义和共产主义，走向全世界和平和进步的新时代。　1959年5月15日（原载北京周报二十二期）
