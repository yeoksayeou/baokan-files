    High Quality, Many Varieties
    Attention Must Be Paid to Completing the Product Plan
    What is the central requirement for comprehensively completing the production plan? It should mainly be two aspects: one is products, and the other is output value. We must not only complete the output value plan, but also, first and foremost, complete the product plan. However, some enterprises now only pay attention to completing the output value plan and do not pay enough attention to the product plan. This is obviously not right. We must complete both the product and output value plans simultaneously, uniting the two.
    In industrial planning and statistical work, total industrial output value is used as one of the main indicators to measure whether each enterprise and each city has completed the state plan. This is acceptable and should be done. The benefit of doing this is that the concept is simple and clear, and the situation of completing the state plan can be explained in one sentence. Also, because the output value is completed according to the product plan, the product quantity and output value explain the same issue. Therefore, output value has its importance and cannot be ignored. However, this does not mean that we can ignore the product plan and only care about the output value plan. It is one-sided and incorrect to view the issue in this way and lead the enterprise's production with this point of view.
    Facts have proven that there must first be a plan for products (variety and quantity), and then a plan for total output value. Total output value is the sum of the price calculation of products. When formulating a production plan, the variety and quantity of products should be arranged according to social needs, and then the output value should be calculated. Without a product plan, it is impossible to have an output value plan. The output value plan is determined by the product plan. This is the relationship between output value and products. This relationship is very clear. Therefore, when we complete the state plan, we must pay attention to completing the product plan. As long as the product plan is completed, the output value plan will naturally be completed.
    Since the relationship between products and output value is so clear, there should be no problems in formulating plans and arranging production. However, when checking the completion of the plan, we find that the leaders of some industrial enterprises often just look at whether the output value plan has been completed and then stop, without carefully examining whether the product plan has also been completed. This approach is a lazy one because calculating output value is relatively simple and easy, while detailed inspection and separate calculation of whether various products have completed the plan is relatively complex and time-consuming. Due to inertia, people often like simplicity and ease and dislike complexity and time consumption. In some enterprises, in order to pursue output value figures, they even spend a large amount of materials to produce products that are not urgently needed or semi-finished products that cannot be matched, wasting materials and tying up funds. As a result, the output value plan is completed, but the product plan is not completed. This puts the cart before the horse and will inevitably bring bad consequences to socialist production, affecting the planned and proportional development of the national economy.
    What is the purpose of production? It is to produce various products to meet the needs of consumption and reproduction. What the people and the country need are products, not output value. Some products, although small in output value, are indispensable. Such as baby pacifiers, hair clips for women, screws for industrial use, ampoules for injections, etc. Without these things, people will feel inconvenienced, and industry will be affected. The more advanced mankind is, the more developed the industry is, the more types of products are needed. This requires industrial departments to produce a wide variety of products to meet social needs, regardless of whether their output value is large or small. This is the superiority of the socialist economy and the glorious task of the production departments and workers on the industrial front. Regardless of the size of the output value, as long as society needs it, we should try our best to manufacture it. We cannot only make products with large output value and not make products with small output value. Imagine what the situation would be for babies, mothers, and the entire family if there were no pacifiers? If ampoules are not produced, injection drugs cannot be packaged and sold, which will bring great pain to patients.
    The output value plan and the product plan should be consistent, but sometimes they are not. There are often situations where the output value plan is completed, but the product plan is not. This is one of the main contradictions in current industrial production. This contradiction needs to be resolved quickly. How to solve this contradiction? The fundamental method is to resolutely arrange production in accordance with the state product plan and social needs, and to oppose the idea of unilaterally pursuing output value without regard to the product plan. (Excerpt from the "Frontline" editorial in Beijing, issue 11, "The Plans for Products and Output Value Must Be Completed Simultaneously")

    High Output on the Basis of High Quality
    High output on the basis of high quality is one of the important topics for us to implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results. High output is a matter of product quantity, and high quality is a matter of product quality. They are interdependent and unified.
    It is not enough for us to merely acknowledge the unity of product quantity and quality. We must further research them. For example, a car can only be considered a finished product when it actually has the performance of a car. If ten tons of iron are produced, and nine tons do not meet quality requirements, the practical significance of the quantity of ten is very small, perhaps only equal to a quantity of one. Therefore, in a relative sense, a product without quality has no quantity. If the manufactured machine is of very high quality, one machine can be used as two or three, which is equivalent to adding two or three more machine equipment capabilities to the country. It can be seen that, in a relative sense, improving quality also increases quantity.
    From the above analysis, it can be seen that, in terms of completing production targets, we must complete both the quantity targets and the quality targets. And in general, quality always occupies a major position.
    Some comrades often say, "It's better to have something than nothing." Is it really "better to have" than "nothing"? When foreign countries have something that our country does not have, and we urgently need to produce a certain product, it is necessary to make efforts to manufacture this product, even if the quality is a little worse. Because the development process of anything is a process from nothing to something, from low to high. In this sense, "to have" is definitely better than "to have nothing". However, first, the "to have" here refers to "to have" under the premise of ensuring the minimum quality, and is "to have" after people's subjective efforts. For example, if we produce alarm clocks, but they are crude and shoddy, blindly pursuing quantity; without a spring, or missing other parts, what is the use of having such an alarm clock? Then it is definitely not "better to have" than "nothing". If a certain defective product cannot be repaired at all, then it is simply "better to have nothing" than "to have something". Second, the "to have" here must also be a "to have" that gradually improves quality. After having it, it is necessary to improve it. This is the objective requirement of production development and the reasonable requirement of the people for producers. If we are only satisfied with the existing quality level and do not want to improve it, how can we reflect the development of production and meet the requirements of the people? Therefore, in the final analysis, we cannot generally say "it is better to have something than nothing." This sentence needs to be analyzed.
    Of course, socialist production is constantly developing, and it will never stay at a certain level. Output continues to increase, one becomes two, two becomes four, four becomes eight..., this change must first be a change under the premise of ensuring the original quality, and even more so under the condition that the quality is improved. It must never be a change that reduces the original quality or does not improve to a higher quality level. In the process of change, two situations are likely to occur: One situation is that within a certain limit of quantity increase, the quality can be unaffected or basically unaffected, and the quality of the product can be guaranteed. But when the quantity exceeds this limit, the quality will change. Another situation is that within a certain limit of quality improvement, the increase in quantity can be unaffected or basically unaffected, but if the quality requirements exceed a certain limit, the increase in output will encounter difficulties. The contradiction between quantity and quality lies here. Therefore, the unity of product quantity and quality is by no means a unity without opposition, but a unity of opposition. The unity of quantity and quality is also by no means unconditional, but conditional. (Excerpt from "Liberation" in Shanghai, issue 10, Qiao Bin: "The Quantity and Quality of Products")

### 质量要高　品种要多

    质量要高　品种要多
    必须注意完成产品计划
    全面地完成生产计划的中心要求是什么？主要的应该是两方面：一是产品，二是产值。我们不但要完成产值计划，而且首先要完成产品计划。现在有的企业却只注意完成产值计划，而对于产品计划则不够注意。这显然是不应该的。我们必须同时完成产品和产值的计划，把两者统一起来。
    在工业的计划和统计工作中，把工业总产值作为主要的指标之一，用它来衡量每个企业、每个城市是否完成了国家计划。这样作是可以的，也是应该的。这样作的好处是概念简明，一句话就可以说明完成国家计划的情况。同时也因为，只要是按产品计划完成的产值，产品数量和产值二者说明的问题是一致的。所以产值有它一定的重要性，不可忽视。但是，这决不是说，我们可以不管产品计划，只管产值计划。如果这样看问题，并且用这样的观点领导企业的生产，那是片面的，不正确的。
    事实证明，必须先有产品（品种和数量）的计划，而后才有总产值的计划。总产值是产品的价格计算的总和。在制订生产计划的时候，应该是先根据社会的需要，安排产品的品种和数量，而后计算出产值来。没有产品的计划，就不可能出现产值的计划。产值计划决定于产品计划。这就是产值和产品的关系。这种关系是很明确的。因此，在我们完成国家计划的时候，必须注意完成产品计划。只要产品计划完成了，产值计划自然就完成了。
    既然产品和产值这两者的关系如此明确，那么，在制定计划和安排生产中就不应该有什么问题了。可是，在检查计划完成情况的时候，我们发现有的工业企业单位的领导人，往往只看一下产值计划完成了，就算了，而不去仔细审查产品计划是否也完成了。这种做法是偷懒的做法。因为只计算产值是比较简单省事的；而要详细检查和分别计算各种产品是否都完成了计划，则是比较复杂费事的。人由于惰性作用，常常喜欢简单省事，而不喜欢复杂费事。在某些企业中，为了追求产值数字，甚至不惜大量投料，生产并不急需的产品或不能配套的半成品，浪费了材料和积压了资金。结果，产值计划虽然完成了，产品计划却没有完成。这样做是本末倒置，势必为社会主义生产带来不好的后果，影响国民经济有计划按比例的发展。
    生产的目的是什么？是生产出各种各样的产品，来满足消费和再生产的需要。人民和国家需要的是产品，而不是产值。有些产品虽然产值小，却是不可缺少的。如婴儿用的奶嘴，妇女用的发卡子，工业用的螺丝钉，装针剂的安瓿等等。如果没有这些东西，人民就会感到不便，工业就会受到影响。人类越进步，工业越发达，所需要的产品的种类就越多。这就要求工业部门生产多种多样的产品，来满足社会的需要，不管它们的产值是大还是小。这是社会主义经济的优越性，也是生产部门和工业战线上劳动者的光荣任务。不管产值大小，只要社会需要，我们就应该千方百计地去制造出来。不能因为产值大的就作，产值小的就不作。可以设想一下，如果没有奶嘴子，对婴儿、母亲和整个家庭将会出现什么样的局面？如果不生产安瓿，注射药装不出去，将会给病人带来多么大的痛苦？
    产值计划和产品计划应当是一致的，但有时又不一致。往往有产值计划完成了，而产品计划完不成的情况。这是当前工业生产中的主要矛盾之一。这个矛盾需要迅速地得到解决。怎样解决这个矛盾问题呢？根本方法是坚决按照国家的产品计划和社会的需要去安排生产，反对片面追求产值而不顾产品计划的思想。 （摘自北京“前线”第十一期社论“产品和产值的计划要同时完成”）
    在优质的基础上高产
    在优质基础上高产，是我们贯彻多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的重要课题之一。高产是产品数量问题，优质是产品质量问题。它们是相互依存、又是互相统一的关系。
    我们仅仅承认了产品的数量和质量的统一还不够，还必须进一步作些研究。譬如一辆汽车，只有当它确实具有汽车的性能的时候，这辆汽车才能算做成品。生产出十吨铁，如果有九吨不合质量要求，这个十的数量的实际意义就很小，也许只等于一的数量。因此，从相对的意义上讲，一种产品，没有质量就没有数量。如果制造出来的机器质量很高，一台可以顶二台、三台用，就等于给国家多增加了二台、三台的机器设备能力。可见，在相对的意义上讲，提高质量也就是增加了数量。
    从以上分析中可以看出，就完成生产指标来讲，我们既要完成数量的指标，又要完成质量的指标。而在一般情况下，质量总是占主要的地位。
    有些同志常说“有比没有好”这句话。果真“有”比“没有”好么？当外国有，我们国家还没有，而我们又迫切需要生产某种产品时，经过努力把这种产品制造出来了，尽管质量差一些，也是必要的。因为，任何事物的发展过程，都是从无到有、从低到高的过程。从这个意义来说，“有”肯定是比“没有”要好。但是，第一，这里说的“有”，是指保证最低限度的质量前提下的“有”，是经过人们主观努力之后的“有”。譬如生产闹钟，由于粗制滥造，盲目追求数量；发条也没有，或者缺了其他零件，有了这样的闹钟又有甚么用处呢？那就决不是“有”比“没有”好。假使某种废品根本无法返修，那简直就成了“没有”也比“有”好了。第二，这里说的“有”，还必须是逐步提高质量的“有”。有了之后就要提高，这是生产发展的客观要求，也是人民群众对生产者的合理要求。如果我们只是满足于已有的质量水平，不想提高，那怎么能体现生产的发展和满足人民的要求呢？所以，归根结底，不能笼统地说“有比没有好”。对这句话要加以分析。
    当然，社会主义生产是不断向前发展的，它决不会停留在某一个水平上。产量不断地增加，一变二，二变四，四变八……，这个变，首先是要在保证原有质量的前提下的变，并且更需要在质量有所提高的条件下的变，决不能是降低原有质量，或不向更高的质量水平提高的变。在变的过程中，很可能出现两种情况：一种情况是，在数量增加的一定限度内，质量可以不受影响或基本上不受影响，产品的质量可以有保证。但数量超过了这个限度，质量就要起变化。另一种情况是：在提高质量的一定限度内，数量的增加可以不受影响或基本上不受影响，但质量的要求超过了一定的限度，产量的增加就要遭到困难。数量和质量的矛盾，就在这里出现了。所以，产品的数量与质量的统一，决不是没有对立的统一，而是对立的统一，数量和质量的统一也决不是无条件的，而是有条件的。（摘自上海“解放”第十期，乔彬：“产品的数量和质量”）
