The statement said that all Korean mothers unanimously demand that the U.S. invading troops withdraw from South Korea, as their presence is the fundamental cause of national division and the disasters and suffering of the South Korean compatriots.

The statement called on the women of South Korea to use all means to prevent the realization of the U.S. colonial enslavement policy and the plans for new wars, to try to prevent their husbands and sons from becoming cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism, and to actively strive to establish contacts with the people of North Korea.

To this end, they expressed their determination to launch a vigorous struggle, actively promote socialist construction in North Korea, and strive to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule before this year's "August 15th."

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, June 12th: The Mongolian Committee for the Defense of Peace, at a meeting held this afternoon, passed a resolution on holding a day of support for the Korean people's struggle. The resolution stipulates that a publicity campaign will be carried out nationwide on June 25th this year to support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland and to demand the rapid withdrawal of U.S. invading troops from South Korea.

The resolution said that the Chinese People's Volunteers have long since completely withdrawn from North Korea, but the troops of U.S. imperialism are still赖 [lai - to rely on; to depend on; to hang around; disreputable] in South Korea, threatening peace in the Far East. The Mongolian people express great indignation at the Syngman Rhee clique's criminal acts of selling out the Korean people.

The notice said that in the current international situation, the WFTU's resolution on supporting the Korean people's struggle is of particular importance, aiming to mobilize the working people of the world to intensify the struggle against the most dangerous enemy of world peace – U.S. imperialism.

The notice called on the Vietnamese working people to unite closely with the fraternal Korean working people, oppose U.S. imperialism's occupation of South Korea and its transformation of South Korea into a U.S. colony.

The notice said that the people of Vietnam and Korea will surely resolutely crush the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism and realize the reunification of Vietnam and Korea.
