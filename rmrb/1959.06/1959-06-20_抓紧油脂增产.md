    Grasping Tightly to Increase Oil Production
    Oil is a food needed by people in their daily lives, and it is also a raw material for heavy industry, daily-use light industrial products, and the pharmaceutical industry. The production of oil is directly related to the production of national light and heavy industries. With the development of China's industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's living standards, oil consumption has greatly increased. China's oil industry has developed rapidly. Oil production in 1958 increased by 14% compared with 1957, and in the first quarter of this year, it rose by 30% compared with the same period last year, but it still cannot meet the current needs of increasing consumption. We are currently in the season before the new oil is on the market. In addition to saving oil as much as possible, we must seize the opportunity and take measures to process the existing rapeseed into edible oil to meet the needs of industrial and domestic oil use.
    This year, China has achieved a bumper harvest of rapeseed, and the task of processing rapeseed oil has also increased compared with previous years. In order to complete this task, it is necessary to complete the purchase, transportation, and processing of existing rapeseed from now until the end of September. And find various ways to seize oil production increases.
    First of all, key rapeseed-producing areas must be given special attention. Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Hunan provinces, which account for more than half of the country's rapeseed production, as well as Hubei, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Anhui, Shaanxi, Guangdong, and Henan provinces, are the main rapeseed-producing areas. Whether these areas can complete their oil production plans has a great impact on the national oil supply in the first half of the year, so it must be grasped tightly. As for non-key producing areas, on the one hand, help oil mills and workshops solve technical difficulties; on the other hand, transport the oil materials that cannot be processed in these areas to large factories for processing as soon as possible.
    Secondly, it is necessary to carry out technical revolution, improve the processing capacity of existing mechanical and traditional oil mills, accelerate the processing of existing oil materials, pay attention to safety, and increase the oil extraction rate. The oil extraction rate of rapeseed differs by about five jin between advanced and backward methods for the same variety. If calculated based on the lowest requirement of an average increase of two jin, twenty billion jin of rapeseed can result in a difference of about forty million jin of rapeseed oil, which is almost equal to the yield of one million mu of rapeseed. Currently, some oil and chemical plants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have achieved a maximum oil extraction rate of 34.87% (rapeseed oil content 35.98%) for mechanical oil mills through high-yield competitions, improved process operations, and the adoption of shelling, softening, and high-moisture steaming and cooking methods. After some county's traditional oil mills in Sichuan Province changed from manual pressing to water-powered pressing, output increased by 50%, and the oil extraction rate also increased by one to two jin. This fact shows that the potential of the current oil mills is great. As long as the masses are mobilized to tap potential, ways to increase production can be found.
    Another important link in increasing oil production is to prepare for the oil production season in the third and fourth quarters of this year. The oil pressing season in the second half of the year will bear more than half of the year's oil production tasks, which requires speeding up the arrangement of basic construction for the oil industry. Now that the sowing season for soybeans, peanuts, and sesame has arrived, all localities should sow appropriately early so that oil materials can be harvested earlier in the second half of this year and all oil mills can start work earlier.
    In order to meet the country's rapidly growing needs for oil, in addition to making full use of existing oil sources, it is also necessary to widely open up various new oil sources. These include cold-pressed soybeans, wild oil materials, aquatic animal oil, corn germ, and silkworm pupa oil, all of which have great potential to be tapped. Rice bran oil extraction, which has been proven effective in the past, should also be vigorously promoted.

    抓紧油脂增产
    油脂，是人们日常生活中需要的食品，又是重工业、日用轻工业品、医药工业的原料，油脂的生产直接关系着国家轻重工业的生产。随着我国工农业生产的发展和人民生活的提高，油的消费量已大大增加。我国油脂工业发展很快，1958年油脂生产比1957年增加14％，今年一季度又比去年同期上升30％，但仍不能适应当前消费增长的需要。目前正处在新油尚未上市的季节，我们除了尽量节约用油以外，更要抓紧时机，采取措施，把现有的油菜籽加工成食用油，以满足工业用油和生活用油的需要。
    今年，我国油菜获得大丰收，菜籽油的加工任务也比往年增大。为了完成这项任务，必须从现在起到9月底止，把现有的菜籽收购、调运、加工一气呵成。并且想各种办法抓紧油脂增产。
    首先，重点产菜籽地区要特别抓紧。占全国油菜产量一半以上的四川、浙江、江苏、湖南等四省，以及湖北、江西、贵州、云南、安徽、陕西、广东、河南等生产菜籽的地区，是当前主要油菜产区。这些地区的油脂生产计划能否完成，对全国上半年的油脂供应影响很大，因此必须抓紧。至于非重点产区，一方面要帮助油厂、坊解决技术上的困难；另一方面要把这些地区的处理不了的油料，尽速运送到大厂加工。
    其次，要开展技术革命，提高现有机榨、土榨油厂的加工能力，加速处理现有的油料，注意安全，提高出油率。菜籽出油率，同一品种先进与落后之间，相差五斤上下，如果按最低要求平均提高两斤计算，二十亿斤油菜籽，就可相差菜油约四千万斤，几乎等于一百万亩的油菜产量。现在，江苏、浙江部分油脂化学厂通过开展高产竞赛，改进工艺操作，采取了剥壳、软化、高水分蒸炊等办法，使机榨油厂的最高出油率达到34.87％（菜籽含油率35.98％）。四川省一些县的土榨油厂，改人力打榨为水力打榨以后，产量提高50％，出油率也增加一至二斤。这个事实表明现在榨油厂的潜力是很大的，只要发动群众挖潜力，是可以找到增产门路的。
    增产油脂的另一个重要环节，就是要为今年三、四季度油脂生产季节作好准备。下半年榨油季节要负担全年油脂生产任务的一半以上，这就要求赶快抓紧油脂工业基本建设的安排。现在，大豆、花生、芝麻的播种季节已到，各地要适当早播，使今年下半年油料能够提前收割，使各油厂都能提早开工。
    为了满足国家对油脂的迅速增长的需要，除了要充分利用现有油源外，还必须广泛开辟各种新油源。其中包括冷榨大豆、野生油料、水产动物油、玉米胚芽、蚕蛹油等，都大有潜力可挖。过去已经证明行之有效的米碾榨油，也要大力推广。
