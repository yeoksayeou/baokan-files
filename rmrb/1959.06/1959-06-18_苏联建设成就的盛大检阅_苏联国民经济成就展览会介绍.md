A grand Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the USSR has opened. It has attracted the attention of the people of the world. This is a grand review of the construction achievements of the socialist Soviet Union in its competition with the capitalist system. In this review, people can not only see the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet Union in the past forty years, especially in recent years, and the material foundation that the Seven-Year Plan will surely complete, but also foresee the splendid tomorrow of the Soviet communist construction.

This exhibition is expanded on the basis of the original three exhibitions of industry, agriculture, and construction, with a total of seventy-one pavilions, of which eighteen are completely newly built. According to statistics, among the various exhibits in the seventy-one exhibition halls, there are as many as 100,000 large exhibits alone. In the industrial and transportation sections alone, nearly 36,000 kinds of exhibits are displayed, including 1,000 kinds of heavy machinery, machine tools and equipment, nearly 2,000 kinds of instruments and appliances, more than 500 kinds of models, and more than 300 kinds of technological procedures.

This exhibition is divided into four parts: all-Union and the Union Republics, industry and transportation, agriculture, and construction. It has absorbed the participation of vast regions and units in the Soviet Union. In the industrial and transportation sections alone, there are seventy-three regional national economic councils, fifteen ministries and their subordinate departments, 1,300 industrial and mining enterprises, and 350 scientific research institutions. Many production innovators, inventors, advanced collective farm members, science and culture workers, and industrial and agricultural experts also participated in the exhibition.

	Various Republic Pavilions
In the all-Union and the Union Republics section of the exhibition, in addition to exhibiting the achievements of the national economy of the fifteen Union Republics, there are also "Science Pavilion," "Pavilion of Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy," "Pavilion of National Education and Higher Education," "Book Pavilion," and so on.

Although the appearance of the exhibition halls of the fifteen Union Republics of the Soviet Union remains the same, the exhibits are no longer limited to agriculture as in the past, but cover all aspects of economy and culture, fully reflecting the prosperous and beautiful life of the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union.

Each Union Republic has a strong industry and a highly developed agriculture. In the "Azerbaijan Republic Exhibition Hall," a model of the Soviet Union's first open-air power station, the Ali-Bairamlinsk Power Station, is on display. In the "Belarus Republic Exhibition Hall," the most striking are the various types of machines. The exhibits show that the number of cutting machine tools produced in the Belarus Republic per capita has caught up with the United States. This Republic was almost a ruin fifteen years ago due to the destruction of the fascist German invaders. The towering coal mining machine in the "Kazakh Republic Exhibition Hall" is the pride of the people of Kazakhstan and the entire Soviet Union, because this machine is the best in the world. Uzbekistan is a well-known "white gold country" that produces cotton, and the exhibits in this Republic's exhibition hall show that Uzbekistan will soon become a "gas country."

Industry and Transportation Pavilion
The industry and transportation section occupies a total of eighteen pavilions, with more than 36,000 exhibits. Seventy-three national economic regions, 1,300 industrial enterprises, and 350 scientific research and design institutions participated in this part of the exhibition. Visiting this section of the exhibition hall is like traveling around the world of technology and machinery. There are more than 900 agricultural machines of various types alone.

Thousands of exhibits are displayed in the "Chemical Industry Pavilion." Here you can see various pipes made of ethylene plastic. Currently, many factories in the Soviet Union use this type of pipe to replace metal pipes. Ethylene plastic pipes can be used to transport acids, cooled gas... From the exhibits, it can be seen that soon, the glass bottles used to hold milk in Soviet stores will be completely replaced by polyethylene bottles that are both light and unbreakable.

People can clearly see the magnificent scale and accelerated pace of the Soviet Union's development of the chemical industry in recent years from these exhibits and the colorful variety of man-made fiber fabrics in the "Light Industry Pavilion."

	Agriculture Pavilion
An especially important part of the exhibition is agriculture. In the comprehensive pavilion, the various Union Republic pavilions, and the twenty-two agricultural pavilions, there are more than 700 sections introducing agricultural achievements.

A "Corn" pavilion, which did not exist in the past, has been specially opened in the agriculture pavilion. Although this pavilion is not large, together with the corn fields, it can truly be called a university that teaches advanced experience. A large hall here is dedicated to introducing how the former backward collective farm in Garinovka Village, Kursk Oblast, has embarked on the road to advancement and prosperity by developing corn production. In 1958, this farm obtained 571 quintals of milk and 110 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land, while in 1953 it only obtained 42 quintals of milk and 8.5 quintals of meat.

		Construction Pavilion
The "Construction Pavilion" is a pavilion that is of general interest to visitors to the exhibition. This pavilion occupies twenty-one halls and ten squares. This pavilion fully embodies the Soviet Communist Party's concern for the housing construction of the working people, and how the Soviet Union is implementing the magnificent program of building 15 million houses during the Seven-Year Plan. Here, the experience of the builders of the Cherepovets steelworkers' city is introduced. They can build a five-story building in just two or three months, which is the fastest in the country. It also focuses on the latest method of building fully assembled buildings, which costs only 960 rubles per square meter, which is much cheaper than ordinary brick houses.

Visitors can also see various styles of complete sets of houses for a family, with various exquisite furniture and refrigerators, sewing machines, washing machines and other daily necessities. It is particularly exciting to see the five rural houses exhibited here, because they are not much different from urban houses, which shows that the gap between urban and rural areas in the Soviet Union is getting smaller and smaller.

	Pavilion of National Education and Higher Education
In the exhibition of achievements in national education, the striking impression is the combination of education and labor production.

In the "Pavilion of National Education and Higher Education," people can learn about the teaching situation of the new eleven-year school system. In this type of school, students only study in the classroom for four days a week, and engage in production for two days. Here, the experience of two universities in implementing educational reform is introduced. The Kostroma Agricultural University and the Magnitogorsk Institute of Mining and Metallurgy have been studying according to the new teaching syllabus since March of this year. Students at these two universities participate in production in factories or farms for the first two years, study by correspondence in the evenings, and study full-time from the third year onwards.

Pavilion of Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
The field of peaceful use of atomic energy in the Soviet Union is expanding year by year. Last year, the exhibits at the All-Union Industrial Exhibition that explained the achievements of the Soviet Union in this regard were contained in only a small exhibition hall. However, at this Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the USSR, the exhibits in this area occupy two pavilions. Many models, charts, and physical objects on display illustrate that the scope of peaceful use of atomic energy in the Soviet Union is very broad. In the first pavilion, there are charts illustrating the distribution of uranium mines and their exploration and exploitation, atomic reactors, a model of the "Lenin" atomic icebreaker, and exhibits illustrating the widespread use of radioactive isotopes in various sectors of the Soviet national economy. The chemical, physical, metallurgical, automatic machinery, and agricultural and biological fields of the Soviet Union are all widely applying radioactive isotopes. The second pavilion mainly displays the achievements of the Soviet Union in the field of atomic power. Models and charts of atomic power stations with various more advanced atomic reactors are on display here. These models and charts illustrate the tremendous technological progress made by the Soviet Union in this technological field. This pavilion also displays exhibits illustrating the Soviet Union's assistance to other countries in developing atomic power. The exchange of scientific experience in mastering thermonuclear reactions between the Soviet Union and other countries is also displayed here.

New Scientific and Technological Instruments
Many attractive new exhibits are also on display at this exhibition. For example, in the "Transportation Pavilion," a specially made colored automatic traffic light is on display. This device does not require human management and can automatically change the color of the light at intersections or crossings to direct traffic based on traffic conditions and pedestrian density.

In the "Health and Medical Pavilion," an artificial blood circulation device is on display. This instrument illustrates the high achievements of Soviet medical science. The exhibits show that when patients with weak hearts need to undergo visceral surgery, in order not to cause the patient's heart and lungs to stop functioning due to the surgery, the use of this "artificial heart" can replace the function of the heart and lungs. There is also an "artificial kidney" in the exhibits, which can temporarily replace the kidney when the kidney loses its function or when the kidney's function is destroyed by toxins.

In the "Science Pavilion," a high-speed photography device called "Time Magnifier" is on display. This high-speed photography device can take 32 million photos in one second. People can use it to study physical processes that are very small in volume and occur in an instant.

In the "Machinery Pavilion," a driverless tractor that can perform is on display. This type of tractor has already begun production.

In the "Radio Pavilion," you can see a radio-controlled rocket spinning in the air; you can also see color TV broadcasting...

    苏联建设成就的盛大检阅
    ——苏联国民经济成就展览会介绍
    规模宏伟的苏联国民经济成就展览会开幕了。它吸引了世界人民的注目。这是与资本主义制度进行竞赛的社会主义苏联的建设成就的盛大检阅。在这个检阅中，人们不但看见到苏联四十年来特别是最近几年所取得的辉煌成就，看见到七年计划必将完成的物质基础，而且预见苏联共产主义建设的灿烂明天。
    这次展览会是在原有的工业、农业和建筑业三个展览会的基础上扩建而成的，一共有七十一个馆，其中十八个馆是完全新建的。据统计，在七十一个展览馆的各种展品中，单是大型展品就有十万件。仅仅在工业和交通部分，就陈列出将近三万六千种展览品，包括一千种重型机器、车床和设备，将近二千种仪器和器械，五百多种模型，三百多种工艺规程。
    这次展览会共分全苏联和各加盟共和国、工业和运输业、农业、建筑业四个部分。它吸收了苏联广大地区和单位参加。仅仅在工业和交通部分，就有七十三个区的国民经济委员会、十五个部及其所属部门、一千三百个工矿企业、三百五十个科学研究机关。参加展览会的还有很多生产革新者、发明家、先进的集体农庄庄员、科学和文化工作者、工农业专家。
      各个共和国馆
    在展览会的全苏联和各加盟共和国部分，除了展出十五个加盟共和国国民经济的成就以外，还包括有“科学馆”、“和平利用原子能馆”、“国民教育与高等学校馆”、“书籍馆”等等。
    苏联十五个加盟共和国展览馆，外貌虽依然如故，但是展品已不像过去仅仅是农业方面的，而是经济、文化各个方面的，充分反映了苏联各族人民欣欣向荣的美好生活。
    每个加盟共和国都拥有强大的工业和高度发展的农业。在“阿塞拜疆共和国展览馆”里，陈列着苏联第一座露天式发电站——阿里—巴伊拉木林斯克发电站的模型。在“白俄罗斯共和国展览馆”里，最引人注意的是各式各样的机器，展品表明，白俄罗斯共和国生产的切削机床按人口平均计算已赶上美国，而这个共和国就在十五年前，由于法西斯德寇的破坏几乎是一片废墟。“哈萨克共和国展览馆”的耸入云霄的采煤掘进机，是哈萨克斯坦人民，也是全苏人民的骄傲，因为这台机器在全世界首屈一指。乌兹别克斯坦是人所共知的盛产棉花的“白金之国”，而这个共和国展览馆的展品说明，乌兹别克斯坦不久将变成“煤气之国”了。
    工业和运输业馆
    工业和交通运输部分共占十八个馆，展品达三万六千多件。参加这部分展览的有七十三个国民经济区，一千三百个工业企业，三百五十个科学研究和设计机构。在这部分展览馆参观，就像周游技术、机器世界一样，仅只各式农业机器就有九百多台。
    在“化学工业馆”里陈列着几千件展品。这里可以看到都用乙烯塑料作成的各式各样的管子。目前苏联很多工厂里都用这种管子代替金属管。乙烯塑料管子可以用来输送酸类、冷却的煤气……从展品中可以知道，不久以后，苏联商店中装牛奶的玻璃瓶将全部用既轻便又不碎的聚乙烯瓶代替。
    人们可以从这些展品和“轻工业馆”中五光十色的各种人造纤维织物上面，清楚看出近年来苏联发展化学工业的宏伟规模和加速前进的步伐。
              农业馆
    展览会上特别重要的一部分就是农业。在综合馆、各加盟共和国馆以及二十二个农业馆中，共有七百多个部分介绍了农业的成就。
    农业馆中专辟了一个过去所没有的“玉蜀黍”馆。这个馆虽不大，可是连同种植玉蜀黍的田地算在内，真可称为一所传授先进经验的大学。这里用一个大厅专门介绍了库尔斯克州加里诺夫卡村过去一个落后的集体农庄，怎样由于发展玉蜀黍生产而走向先进和繁荣的道路。这个农庄1958年在每百公顷农业用地上获得了五百七十一公担牛奶、一百一十公担肉，而1953年却只有四十二公担牛奶和八点五公担肉。
            建筑业馆
    展览会参观者普遍感到兴趣的馆就是“建筑业馆”。这个馆占有二十一个大厅和十个广场。这个馆充分体现出苏联共产党对劳动人民住宅建设的关怀，和苏联如何实现在七年计划期间兴建一千五百万套住宅的宏伟纲领。这里介绍了契列波维茨钢铁工人城建设者的经验。他们建成一幢五层大楼只需两三个月，速度之快冠于全国。这里也着重介绍了最新的全部装配式楼房的建造方法，这种住宅每一平方公尺的造价只有九百六十卢布，比普通砖房便宜很多。
    参观者在这里还可以看到各种不同风格的、供一家居住的整套住宅，住宅里放有各式精美家具和冰箱、缝纫机、洗衣机等日用品。特别令人兴奋的是这里展出的五套农村住宅，因为它们与城市住宅已没有多大区别，这表明苏联城乡差别愈来愈小了。
      国民教育和高等学校馆
    在国民教育成就展览的部分，给人突出的印象就是教育同劳动生产相结合。
    在“国民教育和高等学校馆”里，人们可以了解到新型的十一年制学校的教学情况。在这种学校里，学生每周只在课室学习四天，两天从事生产。这里介绍了两所大学实行教育改革的经验。科斯特罗姆农业大学和马格尼托哥尔斯克矿冶学院从今年3月起已经按照新的教学大纲学习了。这两个大学的学生头两年在工厂或农庄参加生产，晚间以函授方式学习，从三年级起脱产学习。
    和平利用原子能馆
    苏联和平利用原子能的领域，逐年在扩大。去年在全苏工业展览会上说明苏联在这方面所取得的成就的展品，只有一个不大的展览馆就容下了。但是，在这次苏联国民经济成就展览会上，这方面的展品已占了两个馆。展出的许多模型、图表、实物，说明苏联和平利用原子能的范围是很广泛的。在第一馆里，有说明铀矿分布及其勘察和开采工作的图表，有原子反应堆，有“列宁号”原子破冰船模型，还有说明苏联国民经济各部门广泛利用放射性同位素方法的展品。苏联的化学、物理、冶金、自动机械以及农业和生物学的各个领域，都在广泛应用放射性同位素。第二馆则主要是展出苏联原子动力方面的成就。这里展出了拥有各种更加完善的原子反应堆的原子发电站的模型和图表。这些模型和图表说明苏联在这一技术领域内的巨大的技术进步。这个馆里，还展出了说明苏联帮助其它国家发展原子动力的展品。苏联和其它国家交流掌握热核反应的科学经验，在这里也有所展示。
    新的科学技术器械
    在这次展览会中，还展览了许多很吸引人的新展品。例如，在“交通运输馆”里展出了一种特制的有色自动信号灯。这种装置不需要人管理，能靠交通运输情况和行人的密度，在十字路口或交叉口自动地变化灯的颜色来指挥交通。
    在“卫生医疗馆”里，陈列着一件人造血液循环器。这件器械说明了苏联医药科学方面的高度成就。展品说明：当心脏衰弱的患病者需要进行内脏外科手术时，为了不引起患者心脏和双肺因进行手术而停止作用，使用这种“人造心脏”可以代替心脏和双肺的职能。展品中还有一个“人造肾脏”，它可以当肾脏失去作用，或是肾脏的机能因毒害而被破坏的时候，暂时代替肾脏。
    在“科学馆”里，陈列着一台快速摄影设备，名叫“时间放大镜”。这种高速度的摄影器能在一秒钟里拍摄三千二百万张照片。人们可以用它来研究它体积很小的在一瞬间发生的物理过程。
    在“机械馆”里陈列了一架可以表演的无人操纵拖拉机，这种拖拉机已开始投入生产。
    在“无线电馆”里，可以看到由无线电控制的火箭在空中飞旋；还可以看到五彩电视正在播送……。
