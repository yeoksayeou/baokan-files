Plant Introduction and Acclimatization
Yu Dejun
Introduction and acclimatization are two important means by which human beings utilize and transform plants.

Plant introduction should include two aspects: first, cultivating wild plants into domesticated plants, turning the useless into the useful; and second, introducing useful plants from foreign countries so that they can grow on the land of one's own country.

Various plants behave very differently after introduction due to the influence of the natural conditions of their origin and the proximity of their racial development history. Some plants easily adapt to the local climate and soil after artificial cultivation, flowering and bearing fruit, not only maintaining their original excellent qualities but also possessing the ability to adapt to new environments. Some plants require various measures to change their characteristics so that they can gradually adapt to local environmental conditions. According to the principles of Michurin's biological science, the basic method of acclimatization is to sow seeds in a new environment and transform them from the seedling stage. When necessary, in order to improve the vitality of the plant and the quality of the product, some plants must also be subjected to directional cultivation of hybrid seedlings through crossbreeding. New varieties are selected and cultivated. This is an active method of acclimatization. Therefore, introduction and acclimatization are two important means for human beings to utilize and transform plants.

It must be pointed out here that plant introduction and acclimatization are different from general agricultural techniques such as transplanting and cultivation. Because introduction and acclimatization focus on adding new types and varieties to agriculture and forestry. To do this work well, it is first necessary to grasp the natural conditions of the plant's origin and select types and ecological types that are more suitable for the local area. Secondly, it is necessary to find ways to change the plant's living environment and also change the characteristics of the plant itself. This is a long-term transformation process. Especially for perennial woody plants, acclimatization must be carried out from the seedling stage. After growth and development, flowering and fruiting, seeds are obtained and then propagated. It takes several repetitions to successfully acclimatize. Direct transplantation of whole plants, cuttings, grafting or other asexual propagation methods mostly cannot achieve the purpose of acclimatization. Because the characteristics of older plants are fixed and not easily changed.

The entire history of agricultural development is the history of introduction and acclimatization of wild animals and plants.

According to statistics from plant taxonomy, there are approximately 300,000 known species of seed plants in the world, but modern humans have cultivated and utilized only over 500 species. The huge difference between these two numbers immediately shows that up to now, mankind has not done enough in utilizing natural resources. At the same time, it also points out how broad the prospects are for mankind in exploring and utilizing plant resources.

My country is rich in plant species, accounting for approximately 28% of the world's total. What is particularly important is that many of these species are extremely valuable foods, medicinal materials, timber, and industrial raw materials. My country has a long cultural history, and developed agriculture as early as four thousand years ago. Our diligent and intelligent ancestors were experts in introducing and acclimatizing wild plants. The entire history of agricultural development is the history of the introduction, acclimatization, utilization, and transformation of wild animals and plants. Many important varieties of grains, fruits, and vegetables in the modern world originated in our country. This is a significant contribution of Chinese farmers to world civilization.

There are also many successful records of our country introducing foreign plants. Walnuts, pomegranates, grapes, etc. among fruit trees were imported starting from the Han Dynasty. Crops such as corn, tobacco, and peanuts, and vegetables such as cucumbers, broad beans, and potatoes have all been successfully introduced to our country for many years. In the past hundred years, because sea routes have been smooth and exchanges with foreign countries have been frequent, the scope of introduction has expanded somewhat. Black locust, poplar, and Amorpha fruticosa, which are widely cultivated in North and Northwest China, cedars, French plane trees, and paper shell walnuts, which are commonly seen on streets in East and Central China, and eucalyptus, coffee, oil palm, coconut, Casuarina equisetifolia, and rubber trees, which are cultivated in South and Southwest China, are all successfully introduced foreign tree species. Among ornamental plants, there are even more foreign species of bulbous flowers and annual and biennial herbaceous flowers, and new varieties are imported every year, too numerous to list individually.

Since liberation, fourteen botanical gardens have been established to conduct plant introduction and acclimatization work in a planned manner.

In the past, the introduction and acclimatization of cultivated plants were mostly carried out incidentally at agricultural or forestry experimental stations. As the content of introduction gradually became richer and the tasks increased, some countries established specialized institutions to conduct research, or botanical gardens undertook this work. In particular, the introduction and acclimatization of wild plants must possess basic knowledge of plant taxonomy, plant geography, ecology, cultivation, and genetics and breeding in order to carry out comprehensive experimental work. Introduction and acclimatization has gradually become a specialized discipline and a major task of botanical gardens. Botanical gardens in the Soviet Union and other advanced countries have a history of more than a hundred years. Establishing different types of botanical gardens in different natural geographical areas, collecting and cultivating plants from all over the country and abroad, and submitting new varieties successfully introduced, acclimatized, and cultivated in the gardens to agricultural, forestry, and horticultural departments for promotion and production can expand the rational utilization of plant resources.

Although my country has a long history of horticulture, the establishment of modern botanical gardens is only over sixty years old. Before liberation, there were only two botanical gardens in Nanjing and Lushan, and they were small in scale and did not receive support from the reactionary government. The cause of introduction and acclimatization could not develop, and they were all abandoned during the Anti-Japanese War. After liberation, botanical gardens and other scientific research undertakings, like other causes, have received the attention and support of the Party and the government. The original botanical gardens were actively restored, and new botanical gardens were established in appropriate areas. There are now fourteen botanical gardens that are conducting plant introduction and acclimatization work in an organized and planned manner. Preliminary achievements have been made in introduction and acclimatization work in medicinal plants, aromatic volatile oil plants, fruit trees, and forest trees.

Changing the wild state of medicinal plants and breaking through the shackles of the concept of "authentic medicinal materials"

My country is rich in medicinal plant resources and has a long history of application, occupying an important position in the people's health and medical care. In the past, we relied entirely on digging up wild plants and were bound by the concept of "authentic medicinal materials," and the source of natural medicinal materials was felt to be exhausted. Since the State Council issued instructions on the production of traditional Chinese medicine, advocating artificial cultivation of medicinal plants and the principle of local production and local supply, areas with suitable conditions have established medicinal plant farms one after another. On the basis of the original investigation and research, the Nanjing Zhongshan Botanical Garden has listed medicinal plant cultivation as one of the key tasks. Through collection and exchange, it has now introduced and cultivated 590 species of medicinal plants from home and abroad, including Magnolia officinalis, turmeric, Angelica dahurica, Angelica sinensis, and Ligusticum chuanxiong from Sichuan, Scrophularia ningpoensis, Atractylodes macrocephala, and Corydalis yanhusuo from Zhejiang, Codonopsis pilosula and Ephedra sinica from Gansu, Rehmannia glutinosa from Henan, and Atropa belladonna, Hyoscyamus niger, Digitalis purpurea, and Valeriana officinalis from abroad, all of which have been successfully introduced and cultivated, and technical information has been provided for the production of these important medicinal materials.

Changing the situation of relying on imports of aromatic volatile oils and actively introducing wild and foreign aromatic plants

Aromatic volatile oils are widely used in food, cosmetics, soap, and pharmaceutical industries, and in the past, they mostly relied on imports for supply. In order to save foreign exchange and meet needs, it is necessary to actively study the cultivation of aromatic oil plants. The Kunming Botanical Garden has conducted a comprehensive survey and research on the Lauraceae (especially Litsea cubeba), Lamiaceae, and Zingiberaceae aromatic plants in Yunnan, conducting a comprehensive investigation from origin, yield, distribution, classification, chemical analysis to cultivation management and promotion, and proposed production plans. At the same time, it introduced foreign Pelargonium graveolens for cultivation experiments, carried out various agricultural measures from seedling raising to harvesting, and preliminary results have been obtained in analysis and extraction, which can be promoted for production in local people's communes. In the past few years, the Beijing Botanical Garden has introduced wild and cultivated aromatic plants from all over China, such as roses, mint, Schizonepeta tenuifolia, Agastache rugosa, and Perilla frutescens, and introduced excellent varieties of plants belonging to the genera Ocimum, Lavandula, and Salvia from abroad during resource surveys, and is currently propagating seedlings in large quantities. These crops are expected to become an important economic crop in the mountainous areas of North and Northwest China in the future.

An example of the successful distant hybridization of wild fruit trees with cultivated fruit trees

My country has a long history of fruit tree cultivation and excellent varieties, which have long been famous all over the world. However, there are still extremely rich species of wild fruit trees in my country's vast fields that have not been fully utilized. There are fourteen species of wild hawthorns in China, fifty-four species of wild roses, one hundred and fifty species of raspberries, four species of strawberries, thirty-five species of gooseberries and currants, thirty-six species of kiwifruit, and thirty-three species of blueberries. Many of them are edible berries. In addition, there are more wild fruit trees in the tropics and subtropics. Among them, Rosa acicularis and Actinidia arguta are extremely rich in Vitamin C (containing 500-1400 mg of vitamins per 100 grams of fresh fruit), which is higher than all cultivated fruits and deserves attention. Among the more than 150 species of wild fruit trees introduced and cultivated in the Nanjing Botanical Garden, an excellent plant of Actinidia chinensis (also known as vine pear) has been selected. After biological characteristic observation and experiments on breeding, pruning and other technical aspects, complete technical information on the cultivation and management of kiwifruit has been proposed. This wild fruit, which was originally hidden in the deep mountains, may soon become a commercial fruit to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people. The Beijing Botanical Garden collected and cultivated mountain grapes distributed in the Changbai Mountains of Northeast China, selected large-fruited types and hybridized them with various cultivated grape varieties, and cultivated new grape varieties that are resistant to low temperatures (minus 25 degrees Celsius) and suitable for brewing. Its sugar content is as high as 25%. These new varieties can be cultivated in North China without having to be removed from the trellis and buried in soil for winter protection, which can save a lot of labor; at the same time, because the branches and buds are not damaged, a stable yield can be guaranteed every year. This is an example of the successful distant hybridization of wild fruit trees with cultivated fruit trees.

In addition, for trees, flowers, turf, and pasture, each botanical garden is introducing and acclimatizing wild plants on the one hand, and introducing excellent foreign varieties on the other. The successful acclimatization of these new types and varieties will provide rich and colorful planting materials for the landscaping of our country.

Transforming wild plants into domesticated plants to produce more and better industrial raw materials

In order to promote the economic prosperity of mountainous rural areas and solve the current shortage of light industrial raw materials, the State Council has issued instructions to fully utilize wild plants. In less than a year, more than 1,000 kinds of important wild plant raw materials have been discovered throughout the country. Among them, more than 400 kinds can be used for oil extraction after testing, more than 300 kinds of wild fibers can be used for textile and papermaking, and more than 80 kinds of wild chemical raw materials can be used for making sizing glue, and great achievements have been made in processing and utilization. This year, the national botanical institutions actively participated in the wild plant survey work of each province. Two thousand species of important wild plants will be selected from the provinces and regions surveyed across the country to compile the "Flora of Chinese Economic Plants" for collection and utilization reference. However, most wild plants are scattered, difficult to manage, and their quality and yield vary greatly. For some of the most valuable wild and useful plants, introduction and acclimatization experiments must be carried out in the future to propose technical operating procedures for cultivation and propagation, transform wild plants into domesticated plants, improve quality, and promote planting to ensure the production of more and better industrial raw materials.

Our country has extremely rich plant resources and extremely superior natural conditions. Our working people have always been experts in plant introduction and acclimatization in the struggle to transform nature. Now our conditions are even more superior, with the leadership and support of the Party, the guidance of advanced Soviet theory, and the collaborative efforts of plant scientists across the country. It can be predicted that our country's plant introduction and acclimatization work will surely blossom beautifully and bear abundant fruit in the future.

    植物的引种驯化
    俞德浚
    引种和驯化是人类利用和改造植物的两个重要手段
    植物的引种，应该包括两个方面：一是把野生植物培养成为家生植物，变无用为有用；二是引进外国的有用植物，使它在本国的土地上生长。
    各种植物因为原产地自然条件的影响和种族发育历史的远近，经过引种之后表现很不一致。有些植物经过人工栽培，很容易适应本地的风土气候，开花结实，不但保持它原来固有的优良品质，而且具有适应新环境的能力。有些植物还要采用各种措施改变植物的特性，使它能逐渐适应本地的环境条件。根据米丘林生物科学的原理，基本驯化的方法是把种子播种在新的环境中，从植物的幼龄阶段进行改造。必要时为了提高植物的生活力和产品的质量，有些植物还要通过杂交育种的方法，把杂种实生苗进行定向培育。经过选择培育出新品种。这是一种积极的驯化方法。因此，引种和驯化是人类利用和改造植物的两个重要手段。
    这里必须指出，植物的引种驯化和一般农业技术中的移植栽培有所不同。因为引种驯化着重为农林业增加新种类和新品种。要做好这一工作，首先必须掌握植物原产地的自然条件，选择比较适合本地的种类和生态类型。其次必须设法改变植物的生活环境，同时也改变植物本身的特性。这是一个较长时间的改造过程。特别是多年生的木本植物，必须从植物的幼龄阶段开始进行驯化，经过生长发育，开花结实，取得种子再进行繁殖，经过几次反复才能驯化成功。用直接移植全株、插条、嫁接或其他无性繁殖方法，多数不能达到驯化的目的。因为老龄的植物特性一经固定就不易改变了。
    全部农业发展史就是野生动、植物引种驯化史
    根据植物分类学的统计，全世界已知的种子植物约有三十万种，但现代人类已经栽培利用的不过五百余种。这两个数字对比的巨大差额，就立刻说明了到现在为止，人类在利用自然资源方面，还作得很不够。同时它也指出了人类在发掘和利用植物资源方面有着多么广阔的前途。
    我国原产的植物种类丰富，约占全世界植物总数的28％。特别重要的是其中不少种类是价值极高的食品、药材、木材和工业原料等。我国文化历史悠久，远在四千年前就已有了发达的农业。我们勤劳智慧的祖先是引种驯化野生植物的能手。全部农业发展史就是野生动植物引种、驯化、利用和改造史。现代世界上很多重要粮食、果品、蔬菜等的品种都起源于我国。这是我国农民对于世界文明的重大贡献。
    我国引种外国植物也有很多成功的记载。果树中的胡桃、石榴、葡萄等是从汉朝起输入的。作物中如玉米、烟草、花生等，蔬菜中如胡瓜、蚕豆、马铃薯等，在我国引种成功都已有了多年的历史。近百年来因为海道畅通，与国外来往频繁，引种范围又有所扩大。华北西北各地栽培很广的刺槐、笔杨、紫穗槐等，华东华中各地街道上常见的雪松、法国梧桐、薄壳山核桃等，华南西南各地栽培的桉树、咖啡、油棕、椰子、木麻黄、橡胶树等，都是引种成功的外来树种。观赏植物中的球根花卉和一二年生草花，外来的种类更多，而且每年都有新品种输入，不胜一一列举。
    解放后建立了植物园十四处，有计划地进行植物引种驯化工作
    过去栽培植物的引种驯化工作多在农业或林业试验场站附带进行。因为引种内容逐渐丰富，任务加多，有些国家设立了专门机构进行研究，或由植物园担任这一工作。特别是野生植物的引种驯化，必须具备植物分类学、植物地理学、生态学、栽培学、遗传选种学等基本知识，才能进行综合的试验工作。引种驯化已经逐渐成为一项专门的学科，成为植物园的主要任务。苏联和其他先进国家的植物园都已有百年以上的历史。在不同自然地理区域中设立不同类型的植物园，收集栽培国内国外各地的植物，把园中引种驯化培育成功的新品种，提交农林园艺部门推广生产，可以扩大植物资源的合理利用。
    我国园艺历史虽久，但现代类型的植物园的建立不过六十余年。解放以前国内只有南京和庐山两个植物园，且规模狭小，得不到反动政府支持，引种驯化事业无从发展，抗战期间全部荒芜。解放以后，植物园和其他科学研究事业一样，得到党和政府的重视和支持。原有的植物园积极恢复，并在适当地区建立了新的植物园。现在已有植物园十四处，正在有组织有计划地进行植物引种驯化工作。在药用植物、芳香挥发油植物、果树、林木等方面，引种驯化工作已取得了初步成就。
    改变药用植物野生的情况，冲破“道地药材”观念的束缚
    我国药用植物资源丰富，应用历史已久，在人民保健卫生事业上占着重要的地位。过去完全靠挖掘野生植物，并且受着“道地药材”观念的束缚，天产药材来源已感枯竭。从国务院发出有关中药生产的指示，提倡人工栽培药用植物和就地生产就地供应的方针以来，有条件的地区都已纷纷成立药用植物种植场。南京中山植物园在原有调查研究的基础上，把药用植物栽培列为重点工作之一。通过采集和交换，现在已经引种栽培了国内外药用植物五百九十种，其中如四川的厚朴、姜黄、白芷、当归、川芎等，浙江的玄参、白术、延胡索等，甘肃的党参，麻黄等，河南的地黄，国外的颠茄、黑莨菪、毛地黄、欧缬草等，都已引种栽培成功，并为这些重要药材生产提供技术资料。
    改变芳香挥发油依靠进口的情况，积极引种野生和国外的芳香植物
    芳香挥发油广泛应用于食品、化妆品、肥皂和医药工业等方面，过去多靠进口供应。为了节省外汇，满足需要，必须积极研究栽培芳香油植物。昆明植物园对于云南的樟科植物（特别是木姜子）、唇形科，及蓑荷科等芳香植物，进行了综合调查研究，从产地、产量、分布、分类、化学分析直到栽培管理推广等，都进行了全面的考察，提出了生产方案。同时引种国外的香叶天竺葵，进行栽培试验，从育苗到采收进行各种农业措施，分析提炼亦已有了初步结果，即可在当地人民公社推广生产。北京植物园几年来在资源调查中，引种了我国各地野生的和栽培的芳香植物，如玫瑰、薄荷、荆芥、藿香、紫苏等，并引种国外的罗勒、熏衣草、鼠尾草等属植物的优良品种，正在大量繁殖种苗。这些作物将来可望成为华北西北山区的一项重要经济作物。
    利用野生果树同栽培果树远缘杂交成功的一个范例
    我国果树栽培历史悠久，品种优良，早已驰名于全世界。但在我国广大原野中还有种类极其丰富的野生果树，没有充分利用。中国的野山楂果属有十四种，野蔷薇属有五十四种，树莓属有一百五十种，草莓属有四种，醋栗和穗状醋栗属有三十五种，弥猴桃属有三十六种，越桔属有三十三种。其中有不少可食的小浆果。此外在热带和亚热带野生果树产量更多。其中如刺玫果和狗枣弥猴桃含有极丰富的丙种维生素（每百克鲜果含维生素500—1400毫克），含量超过所有栽培水果，值得引起注意。南京植物园在引种栽培的野生果树一百五十余种中，已经选出一种中华弥猴桃（一名藤梨）的优良植株。经过生物学特性观察和繁殖整枝修剪等技术方面的试验，提出了对弥猴桃的栽培管理完整的技术资料。这一种原来隐藏在深山里的野果，不久将来可以成为商品水果，供应广大人民的需要。北京植物园收集栽培了分布在东北长白山一带的山葡萄，选出大果类型并同多种栽培葡萄品种杂交，培育出能抗低温（摄氏零下二十五度）和适于酿造的葡萄新品种。其含糖量高达25％。这些新品种在华北栽培，冬季不必下架埋土防寒，可以节省大量人工；同时因为枝条芽眼不受损伤，可以保证每年的稳定产量。这是利用野生果树同栽培果树进行远缘杂交成功的一个范例。
    此外对于树木、花卉、草皮、牧草等，各植物园都在一面引种驯化野生植物，一面引进国外的优良品种。这些新种类和新品种的驯化成功，都将为我国大地园林化提出丰富多彩的种植材料。
    变野生植物为家生植物，生产更多更好的工业原料
    为了山区农村的经济繁荣和解决目前轻工业原料不足的问题，国务院曾经发出把野生植物充分利用起来的指示。不到一年时间，全国各地已发现重要野生植物原料一千余种。其中经过化验，可供榨油的有四百多种，可供纺织造纸用的野生纤维有三百多种，可供制拷胶用的野生化工原料也有八十多种，并已在加工利用上取得很大成绩。今年全国的植物学机构积极参加各省的野生植物普查工作。在全国普查的省区中将要选出重要的野生植物二千种，编写中国经济植物志，供采集利用参考。但野生植物多数分散，不易管理，品质产量变化很大。对其中一部分极有价值的野生有用植物，今后必须通过引种驯化试验，提出栽培繁殖技术操作规程，变野生为家生，提高品质，推广种植，以保证生产更多更好的工业原料。
    我国具有极为丰富的植物资源和极为优越的自然条件，我国劳动人民在改造自然的斗争中向来是植物引种驯化工作的能手。现在我们的条件更加优越，有党的领导和支持，有苏联的先进理论指导，有全国植物科学工作者的努力协作，可以预言，我国的植物引种驯化工作，今后必能开出美丽的花朵，结出丰盛的果实。
