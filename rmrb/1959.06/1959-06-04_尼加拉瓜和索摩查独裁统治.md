    Nicaragua and the Somoza Dictatorship
    Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America, with an area of 148,000 square kilometers and a population of over 1.3 million. It is a semi-colonial agricultural country, rich in agricultural products such as coffee, cotton, and bananas. Land is concentrated in the hands of a small group of large landowners, with the Somoza family owning one-third of the country's cultivated land. The coffee export industry and gold and silver mining are monopolized by the United States, and imported grains and most industrial products come from the United States.
    Nicaragua has been under the rule of the Somoza dictatorship for twenty-five years. The current President of Nicaragua, Luis Somoza, took office in 1956, succeeding his father (former Nicaraguan President and dictator Anastasio Somoza) who was assassinated.
    For twenty-five years, the Somoza family, with the support of the United States, has turned Nicaragua into the private property of the United States and his own family. The Somoza family has $300 million in deposits in many banks around the world, which is equivalent to Nicaragua's budget for fifteen years.
    During the Somoza era, workers' strikes in Nicaragua were declared illegal, and the Socialist Party (i.e., the Communist Party) was forced underground in 1950. Once arrested, members were immediately sentenced to death. During the twenty-five years of dictatorship, more than 30,000 people were killed.
    In order to please its American masters, the Somoza government did not hesitate to sell undeveloped rich underground mineral deposits and fertile land to U.S. imperialism. In recent years, the United States has forced higher prices when selling products to Nicaragua, while at the same time lowering the prices of Nicaragua's export raw materials. This has led to the bankruptcy of Nicaraguan industry and commerce, causing serious unemployment. The working people are trapped in terrible poverty and starvation.
    In foreign policy, the Somoza government has always succumbed to the United States. In May 1954, Nicaragua signed a "Military Mutual Assistance Agreement" with the United States. In the words of the American "Chicago Daily News": "Somoza is the State Department's main agent south of our border."

    尼加拉瓜和索摩查独裁统治
    尼加拉瓜是中美洲最大的国家，面积十四万八千平方公里，人口一百三十多万。是一个半殖民地型的农业国家，盛产咖啡、棉花、香蕉等农产品，土地集中在一小撮大地主手中，索摩查家族占有全国耕地的三分之一。咖啡出口业和金银矿开采业都为美国所垄断，进口的粮食和大部分工业品都来自美国。
    尼加拉瓜处于索摩查独裁政权统治下已经二十五年了。现任尼加拉瓜总统路易斯·索摩查是在1956年接替他遇刺身死的父亲（前尼加拉瓜总统、独裁者安纳斯塔肖·索摩查）上台的。
    二十五年来，索摩查家族在美国的支持下，把尼加拉瓜变成了美国和他自己的家族的私产。索摩查家族在世界上许多银行中有三亿美元的存款，这个数字相当于尼加拉瓜十五年的预算。
    在索摩查统治的年代中，尼加拉瓜工人罢工被宣布为非法，社会主义党（即共产党）也于1950年被打入地下，党员一经逮捕，便立即被判处死刑。在二十五年独裁统治期间，有三万多人被杀害。
    索摩查政府为了讨好美国主子，不惜把未开发的丰富的地下矿藏和肥沃土地出卖给美帝国主义。近年来，美国在销售产品给尼加拉瓜时强行提高价格，而另一方面又压低尼加拉瓜的出口原料价格。这样，就使尼加拉瓜的工商业倒闭，造成严重的失业现象。劳动人民陷于可怕的贫穷和饥饿的处境。
    在外交政策方面，索摩查政府一向屈从美国。1954年5月，尼加拉瓜同美国签订了“军事互助协定”。用美国“芝加哥每日新闻”的话说：“索摩查就是国务院在我国边境以南的主要代理人。”
