    Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, June 27th—The Iranian People's Party has written to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to firmly protest the implementation of the bilateral military treaty signed between the United States and Iran.
    The letter of protest states: "Under the pretext of defending Iran's independence and territorial integrity and opposing a fictitious aggression, the United States government has recently imposed a regular military treaty on our country, thereby allowing the United States government to bring its armed forces into our territory under this treaty."
    "The wording of so-called 'indirect aggression' contained in Chapter 3 of this military treaty clearly indicates that the issue is not only about using our territory as a base for military operations against Iran's neighbors, especially against the Soviet Union and all Arab countries, but also about allowing American troops to interfere in all Iranian people's movements in order to preserve the police terror regime established in our country since the 1953 military coup."
    "Following the instructions of the military treaty signed with the United States, the reactionary dictatorial government under the control of King Mohammad Reza Pahlavi is actually exchanging national sovereignty and domestic tranquility, as well as peace in the Middle East, for the protection of American bayonets in front of the Iranian people."
    The letter of protest points out that, therefore, the bilateral military treaty signed in Ankara on March 5, 1959, not only poses a serious threat to peace and security in this region of the world, but also becomes a legal tool for the U.S. government to interfere in Iran's internal affairs.
    The letter of protest states, "These facts demonstrate that the principles of the United Nations Charter are being violated, because the Charter stipulates that protecting peace and non-interference in internal affairs are the primary obligations of every signatory to the Charter."
    The letter of protest states: "The Iranian people, deeply concerned about national independence and peace, unanimously oppose this treaty, which grants the United States privileges to bring armed forces into Iran, making Iran an imperialist base of aggression against its neighbors and selling out our national sovereignty."
    The letter of protest emphasizes that in order to accurately reflect the opinions of the Iranian people, which cannot be freely expressed under the police terror system, the Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party firmly protests the implementation of this treaty, which betrays the interests of the Iranian nation.
    The Iranian People's Party declares that this treaty, which violates the will of the entire Iranian people and undermines the principles of international law, has no legal or moral validity whatsoever. Therefore, it cannot bind the Iranian people in the slightest.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, June 26th—According to TASS, Tehran: Two thousand farmers in several southern districts of Tehran, due to extremely difficult circumstances, have occupied the wastelands of landlords. The government authorities, in order to return these lands to their "lawful owners," have mobilized the gendarmerie to suppress them.
    The "Tehran News" wrote in an editorial that the farmers' actions "are a warning and a challenge, a warning and a challenge arising from serious social problems."
    This magazine, which can in no way be accused of being sympathetic to farmers, was forced to admit that in a situation where farmers are extremely short of land, while landlords own thousands of acres of wasteland, "the outbreak of this dissatisfaction is very natural." The magazine went on to say, "This week, this event happened in Tehran, and next week it may happen in another rural area where the tillers have no land."
    "Tehran News" concluded by saying, "As long as this system exists, events similar to what happened in Tehran this week will be repeated, and perhaps with greater strength and scope."

    伊朗人民不受美伊军事条约束缚
    伊朗人民党致函联合国抗议非法条约的实施
    新华社27日讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗人民党写信给联合国秘书长坚决抗议美国和伊朗签订的双边军事条约的实施。
    抗议信说：“美国政府最近在保卫伊朗独立与领土完整和反对一个虚构的侵略的借口下，将一个定期的军事条约强加于我国，美国政府从而根据这个条约把它的武装部队开入我国领土。”
    “载入该军事条约第三章的所谓‘间接侵略’的字样清楚地表明问题不仅在于利用我国领土作为军事行动基地来反对伊朗的邻国，特别是反对苏联和全体阿拉伯国家，而且在于使得美国军队来干涉伊朗一切人民运动，以便保存自1953年军事政变以来在我国建立起来的警察恐怖统治。”
    “遵照与美国签订的军事条约的指示，穆罕默德·礼萨·巴列维国王控制下的反动独裁政府竟然在伊朗人民面前以国家主权和国内安宁以及中近东地区的和平去换取美国刺刀的保护。”
    抗议信指出，因此，1959年3月5日在安卡拉签订的双边军事条约不仅对世界这一地区的和平和安全构成严重威胁，而且还成为美国政府干涉伊朗内部事务的合法工具。
    抗议信说，“这些事实说明联合国宪章的原则遭到破坏，因为宪章规定保护和平和不干涉它国内部事务是宪章每一个签字国的首要义务。”
    抗议信说：“深刻关心民族独立与和平事业的伊朗人民一致反对这个赋予美国特权让它把武装部队开入伊朗，使伊朗成为进攻它的近邻国家的帝国主义侵略基地和出卖我国国家主权的条约。”
    抗议信强调说，为了确切反映伊朗人民在警察恐怖制度下不能自由表明的意见，伊朗人民党中央委员会坚决抗议这个背叛伊朗民族利益的条约的实施。
    伊朗人民党宣布，这个违反伊朗全民意愿和破坏国际法原则的条约没有任何法律上和道义上的效力。因此，它丝毫不能约束伊朗人民。
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社德黑兰讯：德黑兰南部几个地区的二千农民，由于处境极度困难，占据了地主的荒地。政府当局为了把这些土地归还给它的“合法所有者”，竟调动宪兵进行镇压。　　“德黑兰新闻”在社论中写道，农民的这种行动“是一个警告和挑　战，这种警告和挑战产生于严重的社会问题”。
    这家无论如何也不可能被指责为对农民有好感的杂志被迫承认，在农民极其缺少土地，而地主却拥有数千英亩荒地的情况下，“这种不满的爆发是很自然的”。这家杂志接着说，“这一星期在德黑兰发生了这种事件，下一星期也许可能在耕者无田的另一个农村发生这种事。”
    “德黑兰新闻”最后说，“只要存在这种制度，类似这一星期在德黑兰所发生的事件将会重演，并且可能力量更大，范围更广。”
