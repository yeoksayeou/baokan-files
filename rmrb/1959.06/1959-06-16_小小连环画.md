Small Comic Strips

To further meet the demand of preschool and primary school children for art books, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House has compiled and drawn a set of "Small Comic Strips." These picture books are very small and use a folding format, making them easy to carry and read at any time.

The text of these "Small Comic Strips" is very concise, and the content is mostly light, pleasant, humorous, and interesting, but with certain educational significance. There is "Lazy Xiao Er" who is obsessed with treasures, and "Visiting Relatives," which reflects the Great Leap Forward in rural areas in the form of beautiful children's songs, as well as ancient children's stories that have been circulating for a long time and are familiar and loved by the majority of children: "Kong Rong" and "Sima Guang," etc., the themes are very broad. Some of the pictures use cartoon expression techniques, with concise lines and vivid depictions, while others use traditional painting techniques to carefully depict the characters and stories, making the stories more vivid and the characters more distinct. The colors of the pictures are bright and refreshing, giving children a sense of beauty.

This kind of "Small Comic Strip" is planned to publish twenty to twenty-five kinds this year. They will be published successively starting in June. (Attached picture)

    小小连环画
    为了进一步满足学龄前和初学儿童对美术读物的要求，人民美术出版社编绘了一套“小小连环画”。这套画本很小，采用折叠形式，携带方便，随时可以阅读。
    这种“小小连环画”的文字非常简练，内容多是些轻松、愉快、幽默、有趣，但有一定教育意义的小故事：这里有被宝贝迷了窍的“懒小二”，也有用优美的儿歌形式反映农村大跃进的“走亲家”，还有流传很久，为广大儿童所熟悉和喜爱的古代儿童故事：
  “孔融”和“司马光”等等，题材非常广泛。画面有的是运用漫画表现手法，线条简练，刻划生动，有的则采用传统的绘画技法，对人物故事作了细致的刻划，使故事变得更生动，人物形象更鲜明。画面色彩鲜明、爽朗，能给孩子们一种美感。
    这种“小小连环画”，今年准备出版二十种到二十五种。从6月起，将陆续出版。（附图片）
    “司马光”中的一个画面：司马光和小朋友们在捉迷藏。
    “孔融让梨”中的一个画面：你为什么要拿小的？
    “懒小二”中的一个画面：嘿，要有个宝葫芦，我就幸福了！
