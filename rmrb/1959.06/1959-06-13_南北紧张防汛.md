Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Since the beginning of summer, there has been abundant rainfall in vast areas of the south. The Pearl River in Guangdong and the Xiu River in Jiangxi have experienced successive flood peaks. The south has entered a period of intense flood prevention. Some areas in the north have also experienced rainfall, and various localities are actively carrying out flood prevention preparations.
　　In early June, the Han River and Qing River in the Yangtze River basin, the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers in the Dongting Lake system, the Xiu River in the Poyang Lake system, and the Pearl River in Guangdong and other basins experienced rainfall. After June 3, the rain area expanded, and the Huai River and Yellow River banks also experienced rainfall. During this rainfall, most of the above-mentioned areas had daily rainfall of over 50 millimeters for several days. Individual areas, such as Xiushui in Jiangxi, Taoyuan in Hunan, and Fogang in Guangdong, had rainfall exceeding 100 millimeters on the 2nd. The rainfall in Hankou and Hanchuan in Hubei and Qianyang in Hunan was the heaviest on the 8th, exceeding 200 millimeters. In addition, parts of the Songhua River and Liao River basins in Northeast China also received rainfall of about 10 millimeters. In Jining, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there was also a heavy rainstorm on the afternoon of the 9th, which washed away the roadbed of the Sanchakou section of the Beijing-Baotou Railway, causing a temporary stoppage. After emergency repairs, traffic resumed by noon on the 10th.
　　Various localities made necessary preparations for flood prevention in May. During this rainfall, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, and other places made prior flood prevention arrangements. In the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province, 80,000 people were deployed to defend the dikes. In Jiangxi Province, more than 300,000 people were also deployed to the dikes.
　　After the establishment of flood prevention agencies in various localities, they closely focused on the material preparation for flood prevention, the annual repair of dikes, and the inspection of large and small projects. At present, some areas in Zhejiang, Hubei, Henan, and other provinces have basically solved the problem of materials such as grass bags and wood needed for flood prevention by adopting methods of self-reliance, local material acquisition, and stocktaking. In Jiangxi Province, after relying on the masses to raise materials, the prepared grass bags have doubled compared with the previous period and are now being concentrated in transportation hubs. The annual repair projects of dikes in various localities have also made progress. In Hubei Province, the annual repair projects of the main dikes of the Yangtze River and Han River have been completed by more than 90%, and 30,000 people are continuing to repair them. In Hebei Province, the annual repair projects of the Zhang River, Nan Canal, Yongding River, and other river dikes have been completed by 40%. Henan Province has completed more than 26 million cubic meters of earth and stone for annual repairs and finishing projects. The engineering inspection work in various places is also underway.
　　In order to safeguard the continued great leap forward of national industrial and agricultural production this year, the Central Flood Control Headquarters resumed operations in late February, more than a month earlier than in previous years. At present, the headquarters is actively helping various localities prepare flood prevention materials, and is urging and inspecting the annual repair projects, large, medium, and small projects in various places.

    南北紧张防汛
    新华社12日讯　入夏以来，南方广大地区多雨，广东珠江、江西修水等河流已迭次出现洪峰，南方各地已进入紧张的防汛时期；北方有的地区也下了雨，各地在积极进行防汛准备工作。
    6月初，长江流域的汉水、清 江，洞庭湖水系的湘、资、沅、澧诸水，鄱阳湖水系的修水和广东的珠江等流域都下了雨。6月3日以后，雨区扩大，淮河和黄河两岸地区也下了雨。这次下雨，上述大部地区有几天日雨量都在五十公厘以上，个别地区如江西修水、湖南洮源、广东佛冈等地2日的雨量都超过一百公厘，湖北的汉口、汉川和湖南的黔阳8日的雨量最大，在二百公厘以上。此外，东北的松花江和辽河流域部分地区也降雨十公厘左右。内蒙古自治区集宁9日午后还下了暴雨，曾将京包铁路三岔口段路基冲坏，一度停车，经抢修10日中午已恢复通车。
    各地在5月份就对防汛工作做了必要的准备。这次降雨，广东、江西、浙江、湖南等地都事先作了防汛部署。湖南省洞庭湖地区有八万人上堤防守，江西省也有三十多万人上堤。
    各地的防汛机构建立后，就紧紧地抓住了防汛的物料准备、堤防岁修和对大小工程的检查等工作。目前，浙江、湖北、河南等省的一些地区采取自力更生、就地取材和清仓等办法，已经基本解决了防汛所需的草袋、木料等器材问题。江西省依靠群众筹集物料后，准备的草袋已比前一时期增加了一倍，现在正往交通要道集中。各地的堤防岁修工程也有进展。湖北省长江和汉水的干堤的岁修工程已经完成90％以上，现在仍有三万人在继续整修。河北省漳河、南运河、永定河等河堤的岁修工程，目前已完成40％。河南省已完成岁修及结尾工程二千六百多万土石方。各地的工程检查工作也正在进行。
    为了保卫今年全国工农业生产的继续大跃进，中央防汛总指挥部比往年提前一个多月在2月下旬就恢复办公。目前总指挥部正积极帮助各地筹备防汛物料，督促和检查各地的岁修工程和大中小工程等工作。（附图片）
