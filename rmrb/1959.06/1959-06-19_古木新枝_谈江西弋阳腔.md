Ancient Tree, New Branches
    ——Talking about Jiangxi Yiyang Tune
    Ma Shaobo

    When we look back at the history of Chinese opera, we often feel proud of the ancient Yiyang Tune. From the Southern Drama of the Song and Yuan dynasties to the legends of the Ming dynasty, the Ha鹽 (Haiyan), Yuyao, Yiyang, and Kunshan schools emerged in terms of vocal music. The Kunshan Tune, after being reformed and processed by the great Ming dynasty dramatists Wei Liangfu, Liang Bolong, etc., combined Southern and Northern tunes into one furnace, developing the Kunqu opera art that was once extremely popular and had a far-reaching influence on operas in various regions. At that time, the Yiyang Tune was on par with Kunqu opera. From the Jiajing period of the Ming dynasty to the Qianlong period of the Qing dynasty, the legendary operas performed in various regions were mainly Kunqu and Yiyang tunes, which people called the "two major leaders of the opera world." The advantages of Yiyang Tune were absorbed by Kunqu opera, which played a nourishing role in the growth of Kunqu opera; and the rise of Kunqu opera also had an important influence on the later development of Yiyang Tune. Although the two influenced and exchanged ideas in terms of repertoire and performing arts, they were actually striving for progress on their own different foundations because they had different characteristics. Yiyang Tune had a very broad foundation among the people and gradually evolved into many local tunes, such as Leping, Qingyang, Taiping, and SiPing. The emergence of these tunes pushed the development of Yiyang Tune to a new stage. The "fashionable northern and southern Huizhou elegant tunes" popular during the Wanli period of the Ming dynasty incorporated Qingyang, Huizhou, and other tunes, becoming the mainstream of the later Yiyang Tune. It spread widely throughout the provinces. For example, Jiangxi Qingyang Tune, Anhui Qingyang Tune, Sichuan High Tune, Hunan High Tune, Hubei Qing Opera High Tune, Fujian Yiyang Tune, Guangdong Yiyang Tune, Zhengzi Opera, Jiangsu Yang Tune, Zhejiang High Tune, Ping Tune, Henan High Tune, Shanxi Yiyang Tune... all are branches of Jiangxi Yiyang Tune. Since the Jiajing period of the Ming dynasty, the "Jing Tune" popular in Beijing was the Yiyang Tune of Beijing. In addition, the High Tune of Gaoyang in Hebei is another branch of the Northern Yiyang Tune. Shandong Official Tune and Liu Zi Opera are all derived from Yiyang, and there is also a kind of Southern Official Opera in Shandong, which is also a kind of High Tune, without string accompaniment, only chorus accompaniment. This kind of Southern Official Opera was already popular at the end of the Ming dynasty, and its popular area was my hometown - Longbu, Mahuigou, and Lijiatuan in Yexian County, Shandong, and the villages adjacent to Zhaoyuan County. It is divided into two routes, the Longbu area is called the "Western Route," mainly performing "Journey to the West"; the Mahuigou and Lijiatuan area is called the "Eastern Route," mainly performing "Journey to the East" (Eight Immortals stories). In my hometown, there were amateur entertainment organizations called "Shuaerhui" in the early years, and farmers would sing during festivals and slack seasons. Its traditional repertoire includes "Gao Lao Zhuang," "Liusha River," "Luogang Cave," "Yinwu Mountain"... (Western Route) "Sheng Xiangzi," "Xiao Tiantai," "Lin Ying Asks for Divination"... (Eastern Route), etc. True swords and guns are used in performances, with gongs and drums, but no string music. The singing is divided into High Tune, Ping Tune, Zanzi, Lao Tune, Kun Tune, and Storytelling Tune. When I was a child, I saw the Western Route "Shuaerhui" and puppet shows performing "Liusha River" and "Gao Lao Zhuang," etc., which were very lively. Later, due to the spread of Peking Opera, this kind of High Tune opera was rarely performed, and most of the repertoire was preserved in puppet shows. This is how deeply and widely the Yiyang Tune was popularized in various regions, and it has played a nurturing role for operas in various regions for many years, just like Kunqu opera.

    Jiangxi is the birthplace of Yiyang Tune. Before liberation, this ancient Yiyang Tune was only preserved in Raohe Opera, and it no longer had its own dedicated performing troupes. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, rescue work was carried out, and the Gan Opera Troupe was established, excavating and performing many traditional repertoires of Yiyang Tune, such as "The Pearl Shirt", "Yuchi Gong" (i.e. Golden Sable Coat), "Selling Water", "Sending Clothes and Crying at the City", "Night Reading in the Academy", "Visiting Pu in the Snowy Night", "Zhang San Borrows Boots", "Torturing Ji Ping" and other dramas, and also adapted and performed the Ming dynasty legend "The Peony Pavilion" ("Return of the Soul"). This time, the Jiangxi Provincial Classical Opera Performance Troupe brought these programs to Beijing for exhibition and performance, and also brought many excellent traditional repertoires such as Qingyang Tune, Yihuang Opera, and Hui Opera, allowing the audience in the capital to feast their eyes. Although I was a lover of High Tune in my hometown when I was a child, I later came into contact with fragments of Hebei High Tune, Sichuan Opera High Tune, and Jiangxi Yiyang Tune; but for many years, I always regretted not being able to see the original appearance and full picture of Yiyang Tune. This time, Yiyang Tune made a big entrance into Beijing, which has given us a lot of benefits in both research work and artistic appreciation.

    What is exciting is not only that Jiangxi Province has unearthed so many good repertoires, allowing the ancient Yiyang Tune to be preserved; what is more important is that people see ancient trees rejuvenated, the "bringing forth the new from the old" of the repertoire, and the growth of new actors, bringing great joy to the audience in the capital.

    Jiangxi Province's excavation and sorting out of Yiyang Tune's traditional repertoire is complemented by detailed research work. Inheritance and development have been correctly reflected. Facts have proved that without serious research work on traditional art, without carefully distinguishing the essence from the dross, especially due to insufficient understanding of the essence, it is often impossible to inherit well, nor can it be well developed. "Yuchi Gong" and "The Pearl Shirt" are representative repertoires of Yiyang Tune. The sorting out of these plays has achieved the goal of removing the dross and retaining the essence, boldly discarding the dross and carrying forward the essence. For example, "Yuchi Gong" deleted some low-level vulgar parts and unnecessary scenes such as "Mulberry Garden Play", highlighting the theme and Yuchi Gong's righteous character; for example, "The Pearl Shirt" deleted the plots of Taibai Jinxing ordering the Land God to transform into a tiger to disperse the Wang Jinzhen sisters and brothers and Wang Jinzhen whipping Wen Jinting for cruel revenge, streamlined the scenes, and more concentratedly portrayed the characters, making the spirit of the traditional virtues of the ancient Chinese people reflected in the play more prominent. The performing arts and music singing of these plays have also maintained and developed the characteristics of Yiyang Tune.

    "The Peony Pavilion" ("Return of the Soul") is a representative work of the great Ming dynasty dramatist Tang Xianzu. The original play has fifty-five acts. Generally speaking, it is not easy to transplant it into Yiyang Tune, concentrate it into nine scenes, preserve the main essence, and completely highlight the theme spirit of the original play. It should be affirmed that the adaptation work is an achievement. What is particularly commendable is that the singing and music of "The Peony Pavilion" have new developments on the basis of tradition. It is well known that the Yiyang Tune is high-pitched and impassioned, but it is often insufficient in expressing delicate and euphemistic emotions. In order to express the delicate emotions of the characters and the poetic lyrical scenes, the Gan Opera "The Peony Pavilion" flexibly uses methods such as "dry singing", "gong and drum accompaniment", "string accompaniment", "repeated sentences", and "human voice (chorus) accompaniment" in music according to the needs of the content, so that the original tunes are not restricted by the rules, and it dares to dissolve and borrow other tunes, so the expressive ability is greatly improved. We have found that the musical reform of Gan Opera mainly promotes the overall reform through the reform of singing. In the past, the accompaniment of Yiyang Tune music only had gongs, drums, and chorus, without string music; now adding "wenchang" (string and wind instruments) is a good addition. They first determine the key of the tune, distinguish the routes of solo singing and chorus, and determine the solo singing and chorus instruments according to the mood of the script and the needs of the character's personality. For example, the mood of "The Peony Pavilion" and "The Pearl Shirt" is relatively lyrical, and the characters are mainly young male and female roles, so the Xiao (vertical bamboo flute) and Pipa (lute) are used as the main solo singing instruments, and the Erhu (two-stringed fiddle), Zhonghu (alto erhu), Houguan (double-reed wind instrument), and Banhu (flat-bodied fiddle) are used as chorus instruments. For example, "Yuchi Gong" has a bold and rough singing style, so its accompanying instruments use Haidi (sea flute), large Suona (double-reed horn), Gaohu (high-pitched erhu), Dahu (bass erhu), and Houguan. There are also new creations in the chorus. They selected some male and female actors with better vocal music to sing the chorus, divided into male and female teams, male chorus for male voices, female chorus for female voices, which sounds very harmonious. These experiences are worth learning from.

    The positive spirit of the legend "The Peony Pavilion" in ridiculing feudal society and resisting feudal ethics has long been concluded, and for many years it has been known for its fresh, beautiful, and moving lyrics. Although the adapted version has some minor flaws in the work of translating the lyrics; but on the whole, it still retains its rich, elegant, and beautiful style. Now the deletion of "Hell Judgment" is a good deletion; but the key scenes such as "Wandering in the Garden, Surprised by the Dream", "Seeking the Dream and Depicting the Face", and "Flowers Bloom and the Soul Returns" seem to be insufficiently developed and not substantial enough; at the same time, there are many flat lyrical scenes in the whole play, lacking more specific dramatic conflicts, so the contradictions are not sharp enough and cannot be fascinating. The original play has inherent shortcomings in this regard, and this play has its own unique style; but if we can further explore from the "Noisy Banquet", "Hard Torture", and "Round Carriage" scenes, we can make the plot development more substantial, the dramatic contradictions more acute, and the artistic effect may be better.

    In addition, I feel that the set design of the adapted and performed "The Peony Pavilion" is extremely inconsistent with the poetic and artistic nature of the lyrics, singing, and performing arts. The design is not concise enough, the production is not exquisite enough, and the styles and tones of some costumes are not very coordinated. The defects in art hinder the integrity and beauty of the whole play in art. Opera has the characteristics of a highly comprehensive art. The relevant arts in all aspects are indispensable. Following up in art and other aspects can add color to the whole play; if you don't follow up, it will inevitably detract from the whole play.

    The Jiangxi Yiyang Tune, which has a long and excellent tradition and has been circulating for more than 400 years, is a happy event in the Chinese theater world. When we see its new branches flourish, we feel sincerely happy.

    ——谈江西弋阳腔
    马少波
    我们回溯中国戏曲的历史，常常为有古老的弋阳腔而自豪。从宋、元南戏发展到明代传奇的时期，曾在声腔上出现了海盐、余姚、弋阳、昆山诸派。昆山腔经明代大戏剧家魏良辅、梁伯龙等改革加工后，冶南曲北曲于一炉，发展了盛极一时并对各地戏曲具有深广影响的昆曲艺术。当时和昆曲并驾齐驱的就是弋阳腔。从明代嘉靖到清代乾隆年间，各地演唱的传奇戏曲，主要是昆曲、弋阳两腔，人们称为“剧坛两大盟主”。弋阳腔的优点曾被昆曲所吸收，对于昆曲的成长有过滋养的作用；而昆曲的兴起对弋阳腔后期的发展也有重要的影响。虽然两者在剧目和表演艺术方面相互影响、相互交流，但由于两者具有不同的特色，实际上还是在各自不同的基础上力争上游的。弋阳腔在民间有极深广的基础，逐渐演变成许多地方腔调，如乐平、青阳、太平、四平等。这些腔调的出现，把弋阳腔的发展推向了新的阶段。明万历年间盛行的“天下时尚南北徽池雅调”，容纳了青阳、徽州等腔，成为后期弋阳腔的主流。流布之广，遍及各省。例如江西青阳腔、安徽青阳腔、四川高腔、湖南高腔、湖北青戏高腔、福建弋阳腔、广东弋阳腔、正字戏、江苏阳腔、浙江高腔、平调、河南高腔、山西弋阳腔……无一不是江西弋阳腔的支流。自明嘉靖以来，在北京盛行的“京腔”，也就是北京的弋阳腔。此外河北高阳的高腔也是北方弋阳腔的另一支派。山东官腔、柳子戏都是来自弋阳，山东还有一种南官戏，也是高腔的一种，没有弦乐伴奏，只有帮腔伴唱。这种南官戏在明代末年已经流行，其流行地区是我的家乡——山东掖县龙埠、马回沟、李家疃以及与招远县相毗连的一带村庄。它分为东西两路，龙埠一带称为“西路”，以演“西游记”为主；马回沟、李家疃一带称为“东路”，以演“东游记”（八仙故事）为主。在我的家乡早年有叫作“耍儿会”的业余文娱组织，农民们每当年节农闲时，便演唱起来。其传统剧目有“高老庄”、“流沙河”、“罗纲洞”、“隐雾山”……（西路）“生湘子”、“笑天台”、“林英问卜”……（东路）等，演出时多用真刀真枪，有锣鼓，无弦乐，唱腔分为高腔、平调、赞子、老腔、昆调、说书调等。我在幼年看到过西路“耍儿会”和傀儡戏表演的“流沙河”、“高老庄”等剧，十分生动活泼。以后因京剧流传，这种高腔戏便极少演出了，大部分剧目保留在傀儡戏中。弋阳腔就是如此深远的普及各地，多少年来对于各地戏曲，像昆曲一样起过哺育的作用。
    江西是弋阳腔的发源地。这种古老的弋阳腔在解放前，仅仅被保存在饶河戏里，它自己已经没有专门演唱的班社了。解放后，在党和政府的领导下，进行了抢救工作，成立了赣剧团，挖掘上演了许多弋阳腔的传统剧目，如“珍珠记”、“尉迟恭”（即金貂记）、“卖水记”、“送衣哭城”、“书馆夜读”、
  “雪夜访普”、“张三借靴”、“拷打吉平”等剧，此外还改编上演了明代传奇“还魂记”等。此次江西省古典戏曲演出团把这些节目都带到北京展览演出，并且带来了青阳腔，宜黄戏，徽戏等不少的优秀传统剧目，使首都观众饱尝眼福。我在幼年虽然是家乡的高腔的爱好者，后来也接触过河北高腔、川剧高腔和江西弋阳腔的片断；但多少年来总是以未能窥见弋阳腔的原貌和全貌为憾，这次弋阳腔大举进京，使我们无论在研究工作或艺术欣赏方面都得到了很多教益。
    令人兴奋的不仅是江西省挖掘出这么多的好剧目，使古老的弋阳腔得以保存；更重要的是使人们看到古木逢春，剧目的“推陈出新”和演员新生力量的成长，为首都观众带来很大欢喜。
    江西省对弋阳腔传统剧目的挖掘整理工作是和细致的研究工作相辅而行的。继承和发展得到了正确的体现。事实证明：对于传统艺术没有严肃的研究工作，不细致地分清精华和糟粕，特别由于对精华部分认识不足，便往往不能很好的继承，也不能很好的发扬。“尉迟恭”、“珍珠记”等都是弋阳腔具有代表性的剧目，这些戏的整理工作作到了去芜存菁，大胆地剔除糟粕，并将精华部分发扬光大。例如“尉迟恭”，删去了一些低级庸俗的部分和“桑园戏节”等不必要的场面，突出了主题和尉迟恭的正义性格；例如“珍珠记”，删去了太白金星命土地神变虎冲散王金贞姊弟及王金贞鞭挞温金婷残酷报复等情节，精减了场次，更集中地刻划人物，使剧中反映我国古代人民的传统的美德精神，更为鲜明突出。这些戏的表演艺术和音乐歌唱也都保持和发挥了弋阳腔的特色。
      “还魂记”是明代大戏剧家汤显祖的代表作，原剧有五十五出，一般地说，移植于弋阳腔，集中成九场戏，既把主要精华保存下来，而又比较完整地突出原剧的主题精神，不是很容易的事，应该肯定改编工作是有成就的。特别值得赞扬的是“还魂记”的唱腔和音乐，在传统基础上有了新的发展。弋阳腔的高昂激越是人所共知的，但是表现细腻委婉的感情常感不足。赣剧“还魂记”，为了表现人物的细致感情和富有诗意的抒情场面，在音乐方面把“干唱”、“锣鼓伴唱”、“管弦伴唱”、“重句”、“人声（帮腔）伴唱”等方法，按内容需要，灵活运用，使原来的曲牌不为格律所拘束，并敢于溶化借用另外曲牌，因而表现能力大为提高。我们发现赣剧的音乐改革，主要是以唱腔的改革，来推动整个的改革工作。过去，弋阳腔音乐的伴奏，只有锣鼓和帮腔，没有管弦乐；现在加上“文场”，加得很好，他们首先确定曲牌调门，分出托唱和帮腔的路子，并根据剧本的情调和人物性格的需要而确定托唱和帮腔乐器。例如“还魂记”、“珍珠记”的情调比较抒情，人物以小生花旦为主，因而以箫和琵琶为主要托唱乐器，以二胡、中胡、喉管、板胡等作为帮腔乐器。再如“尉迟恭”由于唱腔是豪迈粗犷的，所以它的伴奏乐器就用了海笛、大唢呐、高胡、大胡、喉管。而且在帮腔方面也有新的创造，他们挑选一些声乐较好的男女演员帮唱，分男女两队，男帮男腔，女帮女腔，听起来感到音色十分和谐。这些经验，是很值得借鉴的。
    传奇“还魂记”所表现的嘲讽封建社会，反抗封建礼教的积极精神是早有定论的，多少年来更以曲词清新，奇丽动人而著称于世。改编本虽然在曲词改译工作上不无微瑕；但总的说来还不失其穠丽淡白，美妙优雅的风格。现在删去了“冥判”，是删得好的；但“游园惊梦”、“寻梦描容”、“花发还魂”等重点场目，看来发挥不足，不够充实；同时全剧平面抒情的场子较多，缺乏更具体的戏剧冲突，因而矛盾不够尖锐，不能引人入胜。原剧在这方面，虽有先天性的不足，而且这部戏也自有其独特的风格；但是，如果我们能从“闹宴”“硬拷”及“圆驾”诸出中再深入发掘，还是可以使剧情发展更充实些，戏剧矛盾更尖锐些，艺术效果可能更好。
    此外，感到“还魂记”改编演出的布景设计与曲词、唱腔、表演艺术的诗情画意，极不相称。设计不够简炼，制作不够精致，服装的式样和色调有的也不很协调。美术上的缺陷，对于全剧艺术上的完整性和优美性是有妨碍的。戏曲具有高度综合艺术的特点，各方面的有关的艺术，缺一不可，美术和其他方面一样跟上去，可以为全剧增色；跟不上去，也必然为全剧减色。
    具有悠久的优秀传统流传四百多年的江西弋阳腔进京演出，是我国戏剧界的一件喜事。当我们看到它新枝繁荣，衷心感到幸福。
