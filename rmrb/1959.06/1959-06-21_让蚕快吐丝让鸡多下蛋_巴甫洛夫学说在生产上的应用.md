    Making Silkworms Spin Silk Quickly and Chickens Lay More Eggs
    ——Applications of Pavlov's Theory in Production
  　Xiang Fu
    Silkworms always spin silk at their own unhurried pace, with a gentle and refined demeanor. How can we make each silkworm quickly finish spinning its three hundred zhang of silk?

    Soviet scientists noticed that when the temperature rises, the speed at which silkworms spin silk increases. The higher the temperature, the faster the silkworms spin. Of course, there must be a limit to how high the temperature can be raised, otherwise the silkworms will die from the heat. Moreover, prolonged exposure to high temperatures can hinder the normal physiology of the silkworms, thus affecting the quality of the silk. After further experiments, it was found that combining the increase in temperature with light stimulation, for example, turning on a red electric light, and then after some time, restoring the temperature to normal while still maintaining the red light stimulation, the silkworms would continue to spin silk quickly.

    This method is an application of Pavlov's theory of conditioned reflexes in production.

    Pavlov once conducted the following experiment: When feeding a dog, he would turn on a light or ring a bell, and the dog would salivate. After repeating this experiment several times to obtain food, the dog would salivate even if only the light was turned on or the bell was rung without providing any food.

    Pavlov said: Dogs always salivate when eating food, which is called an "unconditioned reflex" because the occurrence of this reflex does not require any additional conditions. However, after dogs have eaten in the presence of light or a bell sound several times, the light or bell sound becomes a relevant stimulus, a signal of the arrival of food, and even without food, the dog will still salivate. This situation is called a "conditioned reflex."

    Isn't this the same as the method of using red light to make silkworms spin silk faster?

    Applying the same principle, it is also possible to make chickens lay two eggs a day.

    In the May issue of "Popular Science," published by the China Science and Technology Press this year, Comrade He Wan introduced their experiment: Twenty Leghorn chickens aged five to six months were kept in a dark chicken coop (tightly covered with black cloth) from 5:00 AM to 9:00 AM; from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, they were released into the playground to move freely and receive natural light; from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM, they were put back into the dark chicken coop; and from 8:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning, they were illuminated with a 400-watt light bulb. As a result, twelve of the chickens intermittently laid two eggs a day.

    These chickens originally laid one egg every 24 hours, which is an unconditioned reflex. Due to the above treatment, there were two "days" and two "nights" within 24 hours, that is, a conditioned stimulus of artificial lighting was added, so two eggs were laid in one day and night.

    Of course, simply doing this is not enough; it is also necessary to strengthen feeding and management, otherwise the chickens will not have so many eggs to lay.

    As for the matter of chickens laying several eggs a day, there are quite a few examples in our country today. As reported by the China Young Pioneers Daily on June 1, Leghorn chicken No. 106 at the Young Pioneers' breeding farm of the First Primary School in Helongzhen, Yanbian, created a record of laying ten eggs in seven and a half hours. According to their experiments, the chickens were fed more and better, and were also fed at night with the lights on. The basic principle is the same as described above.

### 让蚕快吐丝让鸡多下蛋——巴甫洛夫学说在生产上的应用

    让蚕快吐丝让鸡多下蛋
    ——巴甫洛夫学说在生产上的应用
  　祥夫
    蚕子吐丝总是那样从容不迫，文质彬彬。怎样才能使每条蚕子很快地吐完它那三百丈丝呢？
    苏联科学家注意到，当温度升高的时候，蚕子吐丝的速度就加快了。温度加得更高些，蚕子吐丝的速度也就更快些。当然，加高温度总得有个限度，不然蚕子就要热死了。而且温度升高的时间长了，对于蚕子的正常生理也有妨碍，因而会影响到丝的质量。经过进一步实验，在升高温度的同时，配合着光线的刺激，比方说，开一盏红色的电灯，过一些时候，使温度恢复正常，却仍然保持着红光的刺激，而蚕子仍然很快地吐着丝。
    这种方法，是巴甫洛夫条件反射学说在生产上的应用。
    巴甫洛夫曾经做过这样的实验，在喂狗的时候，开亮电灯或者按一次电铃，这时候狗便流出口水。为吃到食物，这样实验几次以后，只开电灯或者只按电铃而不给食物，狗也会照样流出口水来。
    巴甫洛夫说：狗吃食物总是要流口水的，这叫做“非条件反射”，因为这种反射的发生是不需要附加任何条件的。可是狗几次在灯光或者铃声中进食以后，灯光或者铃声就成了一种有关的刺激，成为食物到来的信号，这时即使没有食物，狗也会流出口水来。这种情形就叫做“条件反射”。
    这和上面开红灯使蚕子加快吐丝的方法，岂不是一样的吗？
    应用同样的道理，也可以使鸡一天生两个蛋。
    在我国科学技术出版社出版的今年五月号“科学大众”上，何婉同志介绍了他们的实验：把五——六个月的莱亨鸡二十只，从早晨五点到九点，关在黑暗的鸡舍里（用黑布严密遮盖）；上午九点到下午四点，放它们到运动场上自由活动，接受自然光照；下午四点到八点再关进黑暗的鸡舍里；晚上八点到第二天早上五点用四百瓦的灯泡照射。结果，其中有十二只鸡断续地出现一天生两个蛋的情况。
    这些鸡本来是一昼夜生一个蛋的，这是非条件反射。由于上面这样处理，一天二十四小时内出现了两个“白天”和两个“黑夜”，也就是说，附加了人工光照的条件刺激，所以一昼夜生下了两个蛋。
    当然，只是这样做还是不行的，还必须加强饲养和管理，不然鸡也没有这么多蛋可生。
    至于鸡一天生几个蛋的事情，在今天我国也有不少。如6月1日中国少年报载，延边和龙镇第一完小红领巾饲养场106号莱克亨鸡，竟创造了七个半小时下十个蛋的纪录。根据他们的试验，也是让鸡吃得多，吃得好，晚上喂食，还点上灯。基本道理和上面所说的一样。
