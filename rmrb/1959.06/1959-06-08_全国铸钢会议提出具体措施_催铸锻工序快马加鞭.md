From our correspondent in Lüda, June 7th: The National Steel Casting and Liaoning Province Casting and Forging Competition Experience Exchange Conference was recently held in Lüda. The conference summarized the experiences of launching a socialist labor competition for high-quality and high-yield casting and forging since the first quarter of this year. It called on the national casting and forging departments to continue to vigorously promote mass movements, strengthen enterprise management, promote advanced experiences, and strive to break through the current weak link in the machinery industry—blank production—to make greater and better achievements for the increase production and conservation campaign.

The conference believes that since the nationwide red flag competition for high quality and high yield in steel casting, iron casting, and forging began last October, a surge of lagging behind to catch up with the advanced and the advanced becoming more advanced has gradually formed, achieving great results. The situation that casting and forging cannot keep up with processing needs has been alleviated to a certain extent. Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory, Dalian Diesel Engine Factory, and Shenyang Iron and Steel Factory have broken through the four main competition indicators of monthly output per unit molding area, monthly output per molding worker, finished product rate, and scrap rate in steel casting, and were rated as national steel casting red flag units.

Among the various advanced experiences exchanged at the conference, the experience of mobilizing the masses and comprehensively strengthening enterprise management was particularly emphasized. The conference believes that earnestly doing all the preparatory work before production, so that the supply of the production rear and the tense battle of the production front closely cooperate and form an organic whole, and "grain and grass go first before the army is dispatched," is an important aspect of strengthening enterprise management. Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory introduced their specific practices at the meeting. This factory prepares drawings, processes, materials, models, and tools in advance before workers go to work. This ensures that production workers are always in an active position, so that production is often carried out with high quality, quantity, and efficiency. Secondly, strictly implement process discipline, and good innovation creations must be incorporated into the process code after verification. Third, adhere to the quality inspection and physical inspection and analysis system. In the production process, Shenyang Iron and Steel Factory set up two lines of defense and fifteen checkpoints according to the molding sand modeling and smelting pouring system, targeting the key points where defective products are prone to occur. Each checkpoint insists on implementing quality inspection and physical and chemical inspection analysis, and corrects problems in a timely manner.

After studying the main problems of current casting and forging production, the conference pointed out that from a national perspective, the production of casting and forging blanks lags behind the needs of mechanical processing, which is still a prominent weak link. This imbalance, in addition to historical and objective reasons, is mainly due to the one-sided thinking of some leading cadres who value quantity over quality, and relax enterprise management, resulting in the chaos of production technology order in some factories, the increase of defective products and defects, and the inability to complete the national plan well.

The conference emphasized that the current rectification of enterprise management order is first and foremost the order related to quality. To this end, all factories are required to mobilize the masses and focus on rectifying the following points in a "three-way combination" approach: 1. Improve the necessary workshop organization structure; 2. Strengthen production technology preparation and establish corresponding systems; 3. Establish process codes and consolidate process discipline; 4. Establish and improve quality inspection and physical and chemical inspection systems.

The conference believes that the main direction of the current technological innovation and technological revolution in casting and forging production should be to vigorously learn and promote existing advanced technologies and experiences, and then gradually improve creation on this basis. After discussion, the conference proposed seven technical directions, namely: the experience of casting using local iron ore and local coke; mud molding and water glass carbon dioxide sand molding that can promote high quality and high yield; mandrel forging; tidal molding that can save fuel; simple hydraulic sand cleaning machines that can greatly improve labor conditions and improve sand cleaning efficiency; and mechanized facilities to replace heavy manual labor. In addition, strengthening the technical education and training of apprentices is also a matter of urgency.

This conference was jointly convened by the First Ministry of Machinery Industry and the Liaoning Machinery Bureau and other units. Representatives from 374 factories and relevant departments across the country attended the meeting. (Geng Yuxin)

### 全国铸钢会议提出具体措施  催铸锻工序快马加鞭

    全国铸钢会议提出具体措施
    催铸锻工序快马加鞭
    本报旅大7日电　全国铸钢及辽宁省铸锻评比经验交流会议最近在旅大召开。会议总结了今年首季以来开展铸锻优质高产社会主义劳动竞赛的经验，并号召全国铸锻部门继续大搞群众运动，加强企业管理，推广先进经验，努力突破当前机械工业的薄弱环节——毛坯生产，为增产节约运动作出更大更好的成绩。
    会议认为：自从去年10月开始，在铸钢、铸铁、锻造方面先后发起全国性的优质高产红旗竞赛以来，已经逐渐形成了落后赶先进、先进更先进的热潮，收到很大的成效，目前铸锻跟不上加工需要的局面有了一定程度的缓和。上海矿山机器厂，大连柴油机厂和沈阳钢铁厂在铸钢方面，突破了单位造型面积月产量，每个造型工人月产量，成品率和废品率四项主要竞赛指标，被评为全国铸钢红旗单位。
    会议交流的各项先进经验中，特别强调了发动群众，全面加强企业管理工作方面的经验。会议认为，认真做好生产前的各项准备工作，使生产后方的补给供应同生产前线的紧张战斗密切配合，结成一个有机的整体，作到“大军未发，粮草先行”，这是加强企业管理的一个重要方面。上海矿山机器厂在会上介绍了他们的具体作法。这个厂在工人上班前即提前做好图纸、工艺、材料、模型、工具等准备工作。这样就保证了生产工人时时处于主动地位，使生产经常按质按量高效率地进行。其次、严格执行工艺纪律，好的革新创造，都要经过验证后才能纳入工艺守则。第三、坚持质量检查和物理检验分析制度。沈阳钢铁厂在生产过程中，针对容易出现废品的关口，按型砂造型和熔炼浇注系统分设了两道防线十五道关卡，每道关卡都坚持执行质量检查和理化检验分析，发现问题及时纠正。
    会议在研究了当前铸锻生产的主要问题后指出，从全国范围来看，铸锻毛坯生产落后于机械加工需要，仍然还是一个突出的薄弱环节。这种不平衡，除去历史的、客观的原因外，主要是部分领导干部存在着重量轻质的片面思想，放松了企业管理，致使有些工厂生产技术秩序陷于混乱，废品、成品缺陷增多，不能很好地完成国家计划。
    会议强调指出：当前整顿企业管理秩序，首先是与质量有关的秩序。为此，要求各厂发动群众，以“三结合”的方式着重整顿下列几点：一、健全必要的车间组织机构；二、加强生产技术准备工作，建立相应的制度；三、建立工艺守则，巩固工艺纪律；四、建立和健全质量检查与理化检验制度。
    会议认为，当前铸锻生产技术革新、技术革命的主攻方向，应该是大力学习和推广已有的先进技术经验，在此基础上再逐步提高创造。会议经过讨论提出了七个技术方向，即：铸造吃土铁土焦的经验；能促进优质高产的泥型铸造，水玻璃二氧化碳砂型；胎模锻造；可以节约燃料的潮模造型；可以大大改善劳动条件；提高清砂效率的简易水力清砂机；以及代替繁重体力劳动的机械化设施。此外，加强对于徒工的技术教育和培养工作，也是一项当务之急。
    这次会议，是由第一机械工业部和辽宁机械局等单位联合召开的。参加会议的有全国各地三百七十四个工厂和有关部门的代表。 　（耿玉新）
