    The Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes states: "We are Marxist-Leninist adherents of uninterrupted revolution, and we believe that there is no, nor should there be, a Great Wall separating the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, or socialism and communism. We are also Marxist-Leninist adherents of the stages of revolutionary development, and we believe that the different stages of development reflect qualitative changes in things, and that these qualitatively different stages should not be confused." What is the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution? What is the Marxist-Leninist theory of stages of revolutionary development? Why should these two be unified? Why are these theories still applicable after the victory of the socialist revolution? Only by clarifying these issues can we unify our understanding of the people's communes and correctly understand the tasks facing the people of our country.

    Only the unification of the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development constitutes Marxism-Leninism

    Marx and Engels initially put forward the clear fighting slogan of uninterrupted revolution, which educated the working class to recognize their historical mission for the whole world and enabled the working-class fighters—the communists—to consciously draw a clear line between themselves and the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois democrats. The bourgeois and petty-bourgeois democrats, proceeding from their own narrow interests, usually take certain individual stages in the revolutionary movement as their ultimate goals; even the most thorough bourgeois democrats only want to win the greatest freedom to develop capitalism and are unwilling to allow the revolutionary movement to go beyond the scope of the bourgeois revolution. Even within the scope of the bourgeois revolution, they are ready to end the revolution and turn against it as soon as their private interests can be satisfied. In contrast to the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois democrats, the proletariat is the most exploited and oppressed class in the old society. To liberate itself from the heavy oppression and exploitation, it must constantly oppose all exploitation and oppression. Therefore, the proletariat in countries still under feudal rule must unite all anti-feudal forces and first carry the bourgeois democratic revolution through to the end. The more thoroughly the democratic revolution is carried out, the more beneficial it will be for the proletariat to carry out the socialist revolution in the next step. After the complete victory of the democratic revolution, the proletariat will then carry out the socialist revolution to establish a socialist and communist society. Marx and Engels pointed out in the "Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League": "The petty-bourgeois democrats, far from wanting to transform the whole of society in the interests of the revolutionary proletarians, only aspire to changes in social conditions which will make the existing society as tolerable and comfortable as possible for themselves." Then Marx and Engels listed the demands of the German petty-bourgeois democratic party at that time, and continued: "The petty-bourgeois democrats want to conclude the revolution as quickly as possible, achieving at most the aims described above. It is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent, until all more or less possessing classes have been forced out of their position of dominance, until the proletariat has conquered state power, and until the association of proletarians has progressed so far that competition among the proletarians themselves has ceased and at least the decisive productive forces are concentrated in the hands of the proletarians. For us the issue cannot be the alteration of private property, but its abolition; not the smoothing over of class antagonisms, but the abolition of classes; not the improvement of the existing society, but the founding of a new one." In other words, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois democrats are only revolutionaries to a certain extent and for a certain period within the scope of the democratic revolution, while communists must be uninterrupted revolutionaries. Later, Lenin developed the Marxist theory of uninterrupted revolution into a theory of the transition from democratic revolution to socialist revolution. Lenin believed that in Russia, where feudal rule existed but capitalism had developed considerably, a bourgeois democratic revolution should be carried out first, and this bourgeois democratic revolution, unlike past bourgeois revolutions, must be led by the proletariat. Once the democratic revolution is completed, the proletariat must transform its leadership in the democratic revolution into leadership in the socialist revolution, so that the worker-peasant democratic dictatorship established during the democratic revolution will prepare the ground for the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    The Social Democrats of the Second International betrayed the Marxist theory of uninterrupted revolution, believing that there was an insurmountable and lengthy period of stagnation between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. They denied the connection between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and denied the possibility of the democratic revolution transforming into the socialist revolution, with the aim of fundamentally denying the possibility of the socialist revolution's victory. If, when bourgeois revolutions occurred in England in the seventeenth century and France in the eighteenth century, capitalism was on the rise and the proletariat had not yet grown strong, then the bourgeois revolutions at that time did not have the possibility of transforming into proletarian socialist revolutions. However, by the 1840s, the contradictions of capitalism had become increasingly acute, and the strength of the workers' movement had become increasingly stronger. Marx and Engels believed that under these conditions, the bourgeois democratic revolution could be transformed into a proletarian socialist revolution. They wrote in the "Communist Manifesto": "The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution, that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilisation and with a much more developed proletariat than that of England was in the seventeenth, and of France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution." Marx and Engels believed that the bourgeois democratic revolution in the 1840s could be transformed into a proletarian socialist revolution mainly because the bourgeois democratic revolution at that time was realized by the increasingly strong proletariat. Under the leadership of the proletariat and its party, the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution were connected. This connection was not understood by the Social Democrats of the Second International. Lenin pointed out that all Kautsky's ilk "do not understand the relation between the bourgeois-democratic revolution and the proletarian-socialist revolution. The former transforms into the latter. The latter, incidentally, solves the problems of the former. The latter consolidates the work of the former."

    Marxism-Leninism insists that the proletariat must transform the democratic revolution into the socialist revolution, that is, adhere to the theory of uninterrupted revolution; however, Marxism-Leninism also insists that the proletariat not adopt policies that directly go beyond the scope of the democratic revolution before the victory of the democratic revolution, that is, adhere to the theory of stages of revolutionary development. Marxism-Leninism has repeatedly pointed out that the proletariat cannot expect to have a decisive battle with the bourgeoisie before the victory of the democratic revolution; the democratic revolution cannot directly go beyond the scope of bourgeois social and economic relations. This is because the democratic revolution is a revolution of one nature, while the socialist revolution is a revolution of another nature. Lenin said: "Only the Bolsheviks have strictly distinguished between the bourgeois-democratic revolution and the socialist revolution: to carry the former through to the end means to open the door for the latter. This is the only revolutionary, the only Marxist policy."

    Trotsky usurped the term "uninterrupted revolution," confused the distinction between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and betrayed the Marxist-Leninist theory of stages of revolutionary development. During the Russian democratic revolution, Trotsky's "theory of uninterrupted revolution" advocated skipping the democratic revolution and directly carrying out the socialist revolution. This fallacy transcended the stage of the democratic revolution and, in fact, aimed to undermine the worker-peasant alliance and the democratic revolution in Russia at that time. During the October Socialist Revolution, Trotsky's "theory of uninterrupted revolution" argued that Soviet socialism could only be victorious and built after the victory of the proletarian socialist revolutions in Western countries. This fallacy opposed Lenin's theory of the victory of socialism in one country and the building of socialism in one country, and in fact aimed to interrupt the socialist revolution in the Soviet Union and undermine the socialist construction of the Soviet Union. Trotsky's "theory of uninterrupted revolution" was thoroughly reactionary and fundamentally incompatible with the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution.

    Marxism-Leninism unifies the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. Marxism-Leninism believes that, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the bourgeois democratic revolution and the proletarian socialist revolution are two revolutions that are interrelated and yet distinct from each other. Because the two have an inevitable connection in the process of development, completing the former revolution creates the conditions for and requires the uninterrupted continuation of the latter revolution, which is the theory of uninterrupted revolution. Because the two have a qualitative difference in the process of development, the latter revolution can only be carried out after the former revolution is completed, which is the theory of stages of revolutionary development. Only the unification of the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development constitutes Marxism-Leninism.

    One revolution follows another, completing one revolution and then carrying out another, advancing continuously

    Since its founding, the Communist Party of China has taken the leadership of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution to achieve complete victory and to build socialism and communism as its mission. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the article "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party": "The entire Chinese revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party of China is a complete revolutionary movement including two stages, the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution; these are two revolutionary processes of different natures, and only after completing the former revolutionary process is it possible to complete the latter revolutionary process. The democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution. And the ultimate goal of all communists is to strive for the final completion of socialist society and communist society." From this, we can see how Comrade Mao Zedong applied the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development to guide the entire revolutionary movement in our country. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out both the connection between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution and the differences between the two. Anyone who violates Comrade Mao Zedong's analysis becomes an opportunist, either "left" or right.

    Before the victory of the democratic revolution in our country, the right-leaning opportunists represented by Chen Duxiu denied the connection between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. They believed that the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution were completely different matters: only the socialist revolution was the business of the proletariat, while the democratic revolution was the business of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the democratic revolution should be led by the bourgeoisie, and the proletariat should not meddle in the leadership of the democratic revolution with the bourgeoisie, but should wait until the bourgeoisie achieves victory and then carry out the socialist revolution in the distant future. This right-leaning capitulationist line, which once occupied a dominant position within the Party, denied the connection between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, abandoned the proletariat's leadership in the democratic revolution, and violated the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution, thus leading to the failure of the Great Revolution of 1925-1927. Later, the three "left"-leaning opportunist lines that appeared within the Party confused the distinction between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The Resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party "On Certain Questions in the History" pointed out: "Although the revolutionary tasks stipulated by the various 'left'-leaning lines were still democratic in many cases, they all confused the certain boundaries between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution and subjectively eagerly wanted to exceed the democratic revolution; they all underestimated the decisive role of the peasant anti-feudal struggle in the Chinese revolution; they all advocated opposing the bourgeoisie and even the upper petty bourgeoisie as a whole. The third 'left'-leaning line even juxtaposed anti-bourgeoisie with anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, denied the existence of intermediate camps and the third faction, and especially emphasized opposing the rich peasants." The various "left"-leaning lines, especially the third "left"-leaning line, confused the certain boundaries between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, adopted policies that went beyond the scope of the democratic revolution before the victory of the democratic revolution, and violated the Marxist-Leninist theory of stages of revolutionary development, thus causing extremely serious losses to our country's democratic revolution.

    Our country's revolution followed the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, which unified the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development, shattered the erroneous lines of "left" and right opportunism, and achieved victory. The correct line of the Party represented by Comrade Mao Zedong adhered to the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution, won the proletariat's leadership over the democratic revolution, thereby preparing the conditions for our country's transition from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. At the same time, it adhered to the Marxist-Leninist theory of stages of revolutionary development, defining the Party's line during the democratic revolution as a revolution led by the proletariat, of the broad masses of the people, and against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, drawing a clear line between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and preventing the adoption of policies that went beyond the scope of the democratic revolution before the victory of the democratic revolution. Under the guidance of this correct line, our country's people's democratic revolution achieved complete victory. After the victory of the democratic revolution, our country began the socialist revolution without interruption.

    On the eve of the victory of the democratic revolution, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party timely put forward the task of "transforming from a new democratic country to a socialist country." The establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 marked the transition of our country's revolutionary movement from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, marking our country's entry into the transition period from capitalism to socialism. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, following the completion of the land reform, the Party Central Committee pointed out in December 1951 the path of realizing collectivization in agriculture through the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In 1952, when the stage of restoring our country's national economy ended, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the Party's general line for the transition period, that is, to gradually realize socialist industrialization and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce over a considerable period. The Party's general line for the transition period also unified the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. In the first few years of entering the transition period, there also appeared tendencies that violated the Party's general line, that is, violated the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. Comrade Shaoqi pointed out in the political report made at the Party's "Eighth National Congress": "The Party's general line for the transition period is the lighthouse illuminating our various tasks. Departing from it, various tasks will commit right-leaning or 'left'-leaning errors. In the past few years, the tendency to deviate from the Party's general line from the right has mainly been to be satisfied only with the gains of the bourgeois democratic revolution, demanding that the revolution be stopped, not recognizing the necessity of our revolution transitioning to socialism, unwilling to adopt appropriate restrictive policies on capitalism in urban and rural areas, not believing that the Party can lead the peasants to socialism, and not believing that the Party can lead the people of the whole country to build socialism. The tendency to deviate from the Party's general line from the 'left' has mainly been to demand the realization of socialism in 'one morning,' demanding the elimination of the national bourgeoisie in our country by means of confiscation, or bankrupting capitalist industry and commerce by means of crowding out, not recognizing that the transition to socialism should take gradual steps, and not believing that we can achieve the goal of socialist revolution through peaceful means. Our Party firmly rejected and criticized these two erroneous tendencies." The tendency to deviate from the Party's general line for the transition period from the right, that is, the tendency to be satisfied with the achievements of the democratic revolution and to stop the revolution, violated the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution; the tendency to deviate from the Party's general line for the transition period from the "left," that is, the tendency to demand the realization of socialism in one morning, violated the Marxist-Leninist theory of stages of revolutionary development. The Party rejected and criticized these two tendencies, adhered to the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development, and carried out the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, and carried out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in 1957. In 1958, when our country's socialist revolution achieved basic victory, the Party formulated the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The Party also put forward the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution in this general line. Under the illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, our country's industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings achieved a great leap forward development last year. Due to the great leap forward and the development of the social economy, people's communes appeared in the rural areas throughout the country.

    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong used the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development to lead the people of our country in one revolution after another, completing one revolution and then carrying out another, and advancing continuously.

    The principles of the theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development are still applicable after the basic victory of the socialist revolution

    As mentioned above, the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development were applied in the past before the victory of the socialist revolution, that is, applied to the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution and the transition from the former to the latter. Now, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the principles of the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development must continue to be applied after the basic victory of the socialist revolution, that is, applied to socialism and communism and the transition from the former to the latter. Although the transition from socialism to communism is very different from the transition from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, socialism and communism are also two interrelated and yet distinct development processes. Just as the democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution, socialism is a necessary preparation for communism and communism is the inevitable trend of the development of socialism. We cannot only stagnate at the stage of socialism and not transition to communism; nor can we enter communism before socialism has been built. Therefore, the principles of the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development are still applicable after the basic victory of the socialist revolution, that is, on the issue of socialism and communism and the transition from the former to the latter.

    Some people do not understand why the principles of the theory of uninterrupted revolution are still applicable after the basic victory of the socialist revolution, mainly because they do not recognize that there are still contradictions in socialist society, and do not recognize that the development of socialist and communist society is also carried out in the continuous emergence and continuous resolution of contradictions. The Party Central Committee pointed out in the article "Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship": "The development of socialist society is also carried out in the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production. In socialist and communist societies, the phenomena of technological innovation and social system innovation will inevitably continue to occur, otherwise, the development of society will stop and society will no longer be able to move forward. Mankind is still in its youth. The road that mankind will take in the future will be many times longer than the road that has been traveled in the past. Contradictions such as innovation and conservatism, advanced and backward, positive and negative will constantly emerge in various different conditions and various different situations. Everything will still be like this: one contradiction will lead to another contradiction, the old contradiction will be resolved, and new contradictions will arise." From this, it can be known that if it is recognized that in socialist and communist societies, the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production is also constantly emerging and constantly resolved, if it is recognized that the resolution of these contradictions is not only a quantitative change, but also a qualitative change, then it is not something incomprehensible that the theory of uninterrupted revolution is still applicable after the socialist revolution. Marxists-Leninists believe that, at any time, the continuous development of the productive forces cannot but cause the continuous transformation of the relations of production and the superstructure. However, after the victory of the socialist revolution, since the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production is not an antagonistic contradiction, the transformation of the relations of production to adapt to the development of the productive forces, the transformation of the superstructure to adapt to the economic base, and the transition from socialism to communism do not manifest as fierce antagonism and conflict, and do not manifest as fierce class struggle. However, constantly emerging contradictions must still be constantly resolved, quantitative changes must also develop into qualitative changes, and socialism must transition to communism. Therefore, the theory of uninterrupted revolution is still applicable after the victory of the socialist revolution.

    Some people do not understand why the principles of the theory of stages of revolutionary development are still applicable after the victory of the socialist revolution. This is mainly because they do not understand that the transformation of the relations of production will only occur under the condition that the productive forces have developed to a certain state. Marxism-Leninism points out that when the productive forces develop to a new stage, new relations of production that are adapted to this stage will appear; and when the new relations of production first appear, they cannot completely replace the old relations of production. With the continued development of the productive forces, when the new relations of production have a relatively strong force and the old relations of production completely lose their basis for existence, the new relations of production can completely replace the old relations of production. If one is eager to completely eliminate the old relations of production when the new relations of production do not yet have a strong force, the development of the productive forces will be damaged. Therefore, after the victory of the socialist revolution, people must also regard the transformation of the relations of production as the result of the development of the productive forces, and must transform the relations of production step by step and in stages with the development of the productive forces. Otherwise, the distinction between socialist collective ownership and ownership by the whole people, and even the distinction between socialism and communism, will be confused. The Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party "On Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" pointed out: "Socialist society and communist society are two stages with different degrees of economic development. The principle of socialism is 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his work'; the principle of communism is 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.'" This means that when the level of the productive forces has not yet developed enough to realize the principle of from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs, it is impossible to enter communism. During this stage, only the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" can be implemented, and therefore the nature of society is still socialist. Therefore, the resolution also pointed out: "Since we are enthusiastic about the cause of communism, we must first be enthusiastic about developing our productive forces, first vigorously realize our socialist industrialization plan, and should not groundlessly declare that the rural people's communes 'immediately implement ownership by the whole people' or even 'immediately enter communism,' etc. Doing so is not only a manifestation of rashness, but will also greatly lower the standards of communism in the minds of the people, distort and vulgarize the great ideals of communism, promote the petty-bourgeois tendency of egalitarianism, and be unfavorable to the development of socialist construction."

    Only by unifying the Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development and applying it after the victory of the socialist revolution will a correct conclusion be drawn on the issue of the transition from socialism to communism, which is "we cannot stop at the stage of socialism and not move forward, but we cannot fall into the illusion of transcending the stage of socialism."

    不断革命论和革命发展阶段论
    如潜
    党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议说：“我们是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论者，我们认为，在民主革命和社会主义革命之间，在社会主义和共产主义之间，没有隔着也不允许隔着万里长城；我们又是马克思列宁主义的革命发展的阶段论者，我们认为不同的发展阶段反映事物的质的变化，不应当把这些不同质的阶段互相混淆起来。”什么是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论？什么是马克思列宁主义的革命发展阶段论？为什么要把这两者统一起来？为什么在社会主义革命胜利以后依然要适用这些理论？弄清楚这些问题，才能统一我们对于人民公社的认识，才能正确理解摆在我国人民面前的任务。
    只有把不断革命论和革命发展阶段论统一起来，才是马克思列宁主义
    马克思和恩格斯最初提出不断革命这个鲜明的战斗口号，曾经教育工人阶级认识了自己所肩负的全世界的历史使命，使工人阶级的战士——共产主义者自觉地同资产阶级、小资产阶级的民主主义者划清界限。资产阶级、小资产阶级的民主主义者，他们从各自的狭隘利益出发，通常是把革命运动过程中的某些个别阶段作为自己争取的最终目标；最彻底的资产阶级民主主义者，也不过是要争得发展资本主义的最大自由，而决不愿意使革命运动越出资产阶级革命的范围；就是在资产阶级革命范围内，只要什么时候能够满足他们的私利，他们就随时可以结束革命，并且掉回头来反对革命。同资产阶级、小资产阶级的民主主义者相反，无产阶级是在旧社会中最受剥削和最受压迫的阶级，它要从重重剥削和压迫中把自己解放出来，它就必须不断地反对一切剥削和压迫。因此，凡是还处在封建统治的国家里的无产阶级，它就要团结一切反封建的力量，首先把资产阶级民主革命进行到底。民主革命进行得越彻底，对无产阶级下一步进行社会主义革命就越有利。当民主革命彻底胜利以后，无产阶级接着就要进行社会主义革命，建立社会主义和共产主义社会。马克思和恩格斯在“中央委员会告共产主义者同盟书”中指出：“民主主义的小资产者根本不愿为革命无产者的利益实行变革整个社会，他们只想使社会制度发生一种能把现存社会弄成对他们尽可能惬意和舒服些的改变。”接着马克思和恩格斯列举了当时德国小资产阶级民主党的要求，又继续指出：“民主主义的小资产者是希望至多也只实行上述要求，便赶快结束革命的，而我们的利益和我们的任务，却是要革命成为不停顿的，直到大大小小的有产阶级都从统治地位上被撤销，无产阶级争得国家政权，无产者的联合不仅在一个国家内，并且在世界一切占统治地位的国家内都发展到使这些国家的无产者间的竞争归于停止，以及至少是那些有决定意义的生产力集中到了无产者手里的时候为止。对于我们，问题不在于改变私有制，而在于废除私有制；不在于掩盖阶级矛盾，而在于消灭阶级；不在于改良现存社会，而在于建立新社会。”这也就是说，资产阶级、小资产阶级的民主主义者，只是在民主革命范围内的一定程度和一定时期的革命者，而共产主义者则必须是不断革命者。后来，列宁把马克思主义的不断革命论发展成为由民主革命向社会主义革命过渡的学说。列宁认为，在封建统治下但资本主义已有相当发展的俄国，首先应当进行资产阶级民主革命，而这个资产阶级民主革命，同过去的资产阶级革命不同，它必须由无产阶级来领导。当民主革命一经完成，无产阶级就要把自己在民主革命中的领导权，转变为社会主义革命的领导权；使民主革命时期建立起来的工农民主专政，为无产阶级专政准备基础。
    第二国际社会民主党人背弃了马克思主义的不断革命论，他们认为，在民主革命和社会主义革命之间，存在着一个不可逾越的漫长的停顿时期。他们否认民主革命和社会主义革命的联系，否认民主革命有转变为社会主义革命的可能，目的是为了根本否认社会主义革命有胜利的可能。如果说，在十七世纪的英国和十八世纪的法国发生资产阶级革命的时候，由于资本主义正处在上升时期，无产阶级的力量还没有壮大起来，因而那时的资产阶级革命，还不具备转变为无产阶级社会主义革命的话，那末，到了十九世纪四十年代，资本主义的矛盾已日益尖锐化，而工人运动的力量已日益壮大，马克思和恩格斯认为在这种条件下发生的资产阶级民主革命，就可以转变为无产阶级社会主义革命。他们在“共产党宣言”中写道：“共产党人现在的视线主要是萦注于德国，因为德国正处在资产阶级革命的前夜，因为德国将在一般欧洲文明更进步的条件下，具有比十七世纪英国和十八世纪法国更发展得多的无产阶级去实现这个革命。因此，德国资产阶级革命一定要成为无产阶级革命的直接序幕。”马克思和恩格斯所以认为十九世纪四十年代的资产阶级民主革命能够转变为无产阶级社会主义革命，主要是因为当时的资产阶级民主革命，是由日益壮大起来的无产阶级来实现的。在无产阶级及其政党的领导下，就使得民主革命和社会主义革命有了联系。这种联系，乃是第二国际社会民主党人所不了解的。列宁指出：所有考茨基之流，“都不了解资产阶级民主革命和无产阶级社会主义革命之间的这种相互关系。前一种革命可以转变为后一种革命。后一革命可以顺便解决前一革命的问题。后一革命可以巩固前一革命的事业。”
    马克思列宁主义坚持无产阶级必须把民主革命转变为社会主义革命，即坚持不断革命论；但是，马克思列宁主义又坚持无产阶级在民主革命胜利以前，不采取直接越出民主革命范围的政策，即坚持革命发展的阶段论。马克思列宁主义一再指出，无产阶级不能指望在民主革命胜利以前，就和资产阶级进行决战；民主革命不能直接越出资产阶级社会经济关系的范围。这是因为民主革命是一种性质的革命，而社会主义革命则是另一种性质的革命。列宁说：“只有布尔什维克才严格估计了资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命的区别：把前者进行到底，就是为后者打开门户。这是唯一革命的唯一马克思主义的政策。”
    托洛茨基盗用不断革命论这个术语，混淆了民主革命和社会主义革命的区别，背弃了马克思列宁主义的革命发展阶段论。在俄国民主革命时期，托洛茨基的“不断革命论”是主张跳过民主革命直接进行社会主义革命，这种谬论是超越民主革命阶段的，实际上是要破坏工农联盟，破坏当时俄国的民主革命的。在十月社会主义革命时期，托洛茨基的“不断革命论”，则又认为只有等待西方各国无产阶级社会主义革命胜利以后，苏联社会主义才能胜利，才能建成社会主义。这种谬论是反对列宁关于社会主义在一国胜利和一国建成社会主义的理论的，实际上是要中断苏联的社会主义革命，破坏苏联的社会主义建设的。托洛茨基的“不断革命论”彻头彻尾是反动的，它同马克思列宁主义的不断革命论是根本不相容的。
    马克思列宁主义是把不断革命论和革命发展阶段论统一起来的。马克思列宁主义认为，在共产党的领导下，资产阶级民主革命和无产阶级社会主义革命，是两个互相联系而又互相区别的革命。由于二者在发展过程中有着必然的联系，所以完成前一种革命，就有条件而且必须不停顿地进行后一种革命，这就是不断革命论。由于二者在发展过程中有着质的区别，所以只能完成了前一种革命，才能进行后一种革命，这就是革命发展阶段论。只有把不断革命论和革命发展阶段论统一起来，才是马克思列宁主义。
    一个革命接着一个革命，完成一个革命再进行一个革命，不断前进
    中国共产党自从成立之日起，就以领导民主革命和社会主义革命取得彻底胜利，并且建成社会主义和共产主义为己任。毛泽东同志在“中国革命和中国共产党”一文中说：“中国共产党领导的整个中国革命运动，是包括民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个阶段在内的全部革命运动；这是两个性质不同的革命过程，只有完成了前一个革命过程才有可能去完成后一个革命过程。民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民主主义革命的必然趋势。而一切共产主义者的最后目的，则是在于力争社会主义社会和共产主义社会的最后的完成。”从这里，我们可以看到，毛泽东同志是怎样应用马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论，指导我国整个革命运动的。毛泽东同志既指出了民主革命和社会主义革命的联系，又指出了二者的区别，凡是违反了毛泽东同志这一分析的人，就成为或“左”或右的机会主义者。
    在我国民主革命胜利以前，以陈独秀为代表的右倾机会主义者，就是否认民主革命和社会主义革命的联系的。他们认为，民主革命和社会主义革命完全是两回事：只有社会主义革命才是无产阶级的事，而民主革命则是资产阶级的事，因此，民主革命应该由资产阶级来领导，无产阶级不必多管闲事地和资产阶级争取民主革命的领导权，而应该在资产阶级取得胜利以后，等到遥远的将来再进行社会主义革命。这种曾经在党内占居过统治地位的右倾投降路线，由于否认民主革命和社会主义革命的联系，放弃了无产阶级在民主革命中的领导权，违反了马克思列宁主义的不断革命论，因而招致了1925—1927年大革命的失败。后来，在党内出现过的三次“左”倾机会主义的路线，则是混淆了民主革命和社会主义革命的区别。党的六届七中全会“关于若干历史问题的决议”指出：“虽然各次‘左’倾路线所规定的革命任务，许多也还是民主主义的，但是他们都混淆了民主革命和社会主义革命的一定界限，并主观地急于要超过民主革命；都低估农民反封建斗争在中国革命中的决定作用；都主张整个地反对资产阶级以至上层小资产阶级。第三次‘左’倾路线更把反资产阶级和反帝反封建并列，否认中间营垒和第三派的存在，尤其强调反对富农。”各次“左”倾路线，特别是第三次“左”倾路线，由于混淆了民主革命和社会主义革命的一定界限，在民主革命胜利以前采取了越出民主革命范围的政策，违反了马克思列宁主义的革命发展阶段论，因而曾使我国民主革命遭受过极其严重的损失。
    我国革命是循着以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线，把马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展的阶段论统一起来，粉碎了“左”、右倾机会主义的错误路线而取得胜利的。以毛泽东同志为代表的党的正确路线，坚持了马克思列宁主义的不断革命论，争得了无产阶级对民主革命的领导权，从而为我国由民主革命过渡到社会主义革命准备了条件，同时又坚持了马克思列宁主义的革命发展阶段论，把党在民主革命时期的路线规定为：无产阶级领导的、人民大众的、反帝国主义反封建主义反官僚资本的革命，划清了民主革命和社会主义革命的界限，防止了在民主革命胜利以前采取越出民主革命范围的政策。在这个正确的路线指导下，我国人民民主革命就取得了彻底胜利。在民主革命胜利以后，我国就不停顿地开始了社会主义革命。
    还在民主革命胜利的前夜，党的七届二中全会就及时地提出了“由新民主主义国家转变为社会主义的国家”的任务。1949年，中华人民共和国的建立，标志着我国革命运动从民主革命到社会主义革命的转变，标志着我国进入从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。在中华人民共和国建立以后，紧接着土地改革的完成，党中央在1951年12月就指出了在农业方面通过互助合作运动实现集体化的道路。在1952年，当我国国民经济恢复阶段终结的时候，党中央和毛泽东同志就提出了党在过渡时期的总路线，即在一个相当长的时间内，逐步实现社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。党在过渡时期的总路线，同样是把马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论统一起来的。在进入过渡时期的头几年，也曾出现过违背党的总路线，即违背不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的倾向。少奇同志在党的“八大”所作的政治报告中指出：“党在过渡时期的总路线是照耀我们各项工作的灯塔。各项工作离开它，就要犯右倾或者‘左’倾的错误。在过去几年中，从右面离开党的总路线的倾向，主要地是仅仅满足于资产阶级民主革命的既得成就，要求把革命停顿下来，不承认我们的革命有向社会主义过渡的必要，不愿意对城市和农村的资本主义采取适当的限制政策，不相信党能够领导农民走向社会主义，不相信党能够领导全国人民建成社会主义。从‘左’面离开党的总路线的倾向，主要地是要求在‘一个早上’就实现社会主义，要求在我国用没收的方法消灭民族资产阶级，或者用排挤的方法使资本主义工商业破产，不承认过渡到社会主义应当采取逐步前进的步骤，不相信我们可以经过和平的道路达到社会主义革命的目的。我们党坚决地拒绝和批判了这两种错误的倾向。”这里所指的那种从右面离开党在过渡时期的总路线的倾向，即满足于民主革命的成就而要把革命停顿下来的倾向，就是违背了马克思列宁主义的不断革命论；这里所指的那种从“左”面离开党在过渡时期的总路线的倾向，即要求在一个早上实现社会主义的倾向，就是违背了马克思列宁主义的革命发展阶段论。党拒绝和批判了这两种倾向，坚持了不断革命论和革命发展阶段论，在1955年冬到1956年春，进行了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命，1957年又进行了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。1958年，当我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利的时候，党又制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。党在这个总路线中又提出了技术革命和文化革命的任务。在党的建设社会主义的总路线照耀下，去年我国工农业生产和各项建设事业获得了大跃进的发展。由于大跃进，由于社会经济的发展，就在全国农村出现了人民公社。
    党中央和毛泽东同志就是这样地用不断革命论和革命发展阶段论，领导我国人民一个革命接着一个革命，完成一个革命再进行一个革命而不断前进的。
    不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的原理在社会主义革命基本胜利以后仍然适用
    如上所述，马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论，过去是应用在社会主义革命胜利以前，即应用在民主革命和社会主义革命以及由前者向后者过渡的问题上。现在，党中央和毛泽东同志指出，马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的原理，也必须继续应用在社会主义革命基本胜利以后，即应用在社会主义和共产主义以及由前者向后者过渡的问题上。由社会主义向共产主义过渡，虽然和由民主革命向社会主义革命过渡有很大的不同；但是，社会主义和共产主义也是两个相互联系而又相互区别的发展过程。正如民主革命是社会主义革命的必要准备、社会主义革命是民主革命发展的必然趋势一样，社会主义是共产主义的必要准备，共产主义是社会主义发展的必然趋势。不能只停滞在社会主义阶段上不向共产主义过渡；也不能在没有建成社会主义之前就进入共产主义。因此，马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的原理，在社会主义革命基本胜利以后，即在社会主义和共产主义以及由前者向后者的过渡问题上，依然是适用的。
    有些人不了解在社会主义革命基本胜利以后，为什么不断革命论的原理还适用，这主要是由于他们不承认社会主义社会还有矛盾，不承认社会主义和共产主义社会的发展，也是在矛盾的不断出现又不断解决中进行着的。党中央在“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文中指出：“社会主义社会的发展也是在生产力和生产关系的矛盾中进行着的。在社会主义社会和共产主义社会中，技术革新和社会制度革新的现象，都将是必然要继续发生的，否则，社会的发展就将停止下来，社会就不可能再前进了。人类现在还是在青年时代。人类将来要走的路，将比过去走过的路，不知道要长远得多少倍。革新和守旧，先进和落后，积极和消极这类矛盾，都将不断地在各种不同的条件下和各种不同的情况中出现。一切都还将是这样：一个矛盾将导致另一个矛盾，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会产生。”由此可知，如果承认在社会主义和共产主义社会里，生产力和生产关系的矛盾，也是不断出现又不断解决的，如果承认这些矛盾的解决不仅是量的变化，而且也有质的变化，那么，不断革命论在社会主义革命以后还适用，就不是什么不可理解的事了。马克思列宁主义者认为，不论在任何时候，生产力的不断发展，便不能不引起生产关系和上层建筑的不断变革。不过，在社会主义革命胜利以后，由于生产力和生产关系之间的矛盾不是对抗性的矛盾，因而变革生产关系以适应生产力的发展，变革上层建筑以适应经济基础，由社会主义过渡向共产主义，并不表现为剧烈的对抗和冲突，并不表现为剧烈的阶级斗争罢了。但是，不断出现的矛盾还必须不断解决，量的变化也还要发展为质的变化，社会主义一定要过渡到共产主义，因此，不断革命论在社会主义革命胜利以后，也还是适用的。
    有些人不了解在社会主义革命胜利以后，为什么革命发展阶段论的原理还适用。这主要是由于他们不了解生产关系的变革，是在生产力发展到某种状况的条件下才会发生的。马克思列宁主义指出，当生产力发展到某一新的阶段，才会出现与这个阶段相适应的新的生产关系；而且当新的生产关系初出现的时候，它还不能完全代替旧的生产关系。随着生产力的继续发展，当新的生产关系具有了比较强大的力量，而旧的生产关系完全失去其存在的基础的时候，新的生产关系才能完全代替旧的生产关系。如果当新的生产关系还没有强大的力量，就急于要完全消灭旧的生产关系，便会使生产力的发展遭受破坏。因此，在社会主义革命胜利以后，人们也必须把生产关系的变革看作是生产力发展的结果，也必须随着生产力的发展，有步骤地、分阶段地去变革生产关系。否则就会混淆社会主义的集体所有制和全民所有制的区别，甚至混淆社会主义和共产主义的区别。党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”指出：“社会主义社会和共产主义社会是经济上发展程度不同的两个阶段。社会主义的原则是‘各尽所能，按劳分配’；共产主义的原则是‘各尽所能，按需分配’。”这就是说，当生产力的水平还没有发展到足以实现各尽所能、按需分配原则的时候，就不能进入共产主义。在这个阶段内，还只能实行“各尽所能，按劳分配”的原则，因而社会的性质也还是社会主义的。因此，决议又指出：“我们既然热心于共产主义事业，就必须首先热心于发展我们的生产力，首先用大力实现我们的社会主义工业化计划，而不应当无根据地宣布农村的人民公社‘立即实行全民所有制’，甚至‘立即进入共产主义’等等，那样作，不仅是一种轻率的表现，而且将大大地降低共产主义在人民心目中的标准，使共产主义伟大的理想受到歪曲和庸俗化，助长小资产阶级的平均主义倾向，不利于社会主义建设的发展。”
    只有把马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论统一起来，应用在社会主义革命胜利以后，才会对于由社会主义向共产主义过渡的问题得出正确的结论，就是“我们不能在社会主义阶段上停步不前，但是也不能陷入超越社会主义阶段的空想”。
