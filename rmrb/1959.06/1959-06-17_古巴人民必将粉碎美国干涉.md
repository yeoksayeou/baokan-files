The Cuban People Will Surely Crush U.S. Interference
By Our Staff Commentator

Just as the U.S. ruling group shamelessly interfered in the Cuban provisional government's measures to punish Batista's criminals not long ago, it is now openly clamoring against Cuba's major revolutionary measures for land reform. The U.S. "New York Times" threatened the Cuban people, saying, "Measures that harm Americans will not be beneficial to Cubans." The U.S. "Time" magazine threatened that Cuba would experience another "Guatemalan event." Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Braden openly called for "another revolution to drive out Fidel Castro." In a recent note to the Cuban government, the U.S. government even expressed "regret" that the Cuban government "did not seek to listen to the opinions of American investors in Cuba" when formulating the land reform law, and unreasonably demanded that the Cuban government "further exchange views" with the United States on the consequences of the land reform law. This fully exposes the shameless face of the United States in interfering in Cuba's internal affairs.

The Cuban government's formulation of the land reform law is purely its internal affair, and there is no reason to invite the big bosses of American sugar companies who plunder the Cuban farmers' blood and sweat as consultants. The land reform implemented in Cuba is based on the abolition of the latifundio system, and the U.S. monopoly capital organizations are the number one latifundio owners who control nearly 75% of Cuba's fertile land. Of course, the land reform law cannot but "offend" the interests of these U.S. monopoly capital, but this is a matter of course!

Land reform is a major fundamental measure of the Cuban revolution. The latifundio system is the root cause of the Cuban people's long-term miserable life. This system is inextricably linked to the plunder of U.S. monopoly capital in Cuba. If the Cuban revolution is to move forward, it must implement land reform; if the Cuban people are to free themselves from a miserable life, they must dig out the root of the latifundio system. In this Cuban land reform, 220,000 caballerias of land (each caballeria is equivalent to about 201.28 Chinese mu) owned by the latifundio owners will be involved, of which 108,000 caballerias are owned by only 23 American sugar companies. Therefore, the problem is very clear: if Cuba's land reform is to conform to the interests of the Cuban people, it cannot conform to the interests of U.S. monopoly capital; if Cuba's land reform is to listen to the opinions of U.S. monopoly capital, it is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger!

This interference by U.S. imperialism in Cuba's land reform is a continuation of its interference in Cuba's punishment of war criminals. Its purpose is not only to obstruct the Cuban government from implementing policies that conform to the interests of the Cuban people, but also to create fear and hatred of Cuba among the rulers of other Latin American countries through these interference actions under the guise of "anti-communist threat", and to divide the unity of the Cuban people of all strata, so as to replay the story of the armed overthrow of the Arbenz government of Guatemala in Cuba in 1954. Now, in addition to exerting various political and economic pressures on the Cuban government, colluding with Cuban feudal latifundio owners to resist land reform activities, and attempting to directly sabotage land reform, the United States is actively carrying out a conspiracy of international armed intervention in Cuba. The U.S. Senate recently passed a resolution to allocate $29.5 million in "loans" to establish a so-called "police force" for the Americas. U.S. Senator Smathers, who proposed this bill, made no secret of the fact that the guns of this force were aimed at Cuba, saying: "Since Fidel Castro came to power, a storm has threatened the Caribbean." The United States has also instructed the ministers of internal affairs of six Central American countries to hold a meeting to discuss "preventing communism" from "penetrating" the Caribbean region, and its spearhead is undoubtedly also aimed at Cuba. At the same time, the United States is stepping up reinforcements to its Guantanamo naval base in Cuba, seriously threatening the peace and security of Cuba and the Latin American region.

The Cuban people and government have shown great courage in the face of this shameless interference and intimidation by U.S. imperialism. Prime Minister Castro declared heroically that Cuba "will not change a comma in the land reform law"; the Cuban people are mobilizing to fight to defend the revolution and defend land reform. The cause of the Cuban people is a just cause, and the people of all Latin America are supporting their struggle, and the people of the whole world are sympathizing with their struggle. Prime Minister Castro pointed out that although land reform has caused opposition, "the enemy has just stimulated the revolution to move forward." Yes! No enemy, even the ferocious U.S. imperialism, can stop the Cuban people from moving forward. The shameless interference of U.S. imperialism will surely be crushed by the united strength of the Cuban people!

    古巴人民必将粉碎美国干涉
    本报评论员
    像不久以前对古巴临时政府惩治巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子的措施所进行的无耻干涉一样，美国统治集团又在公开叫嚣反对古巴进行土地改革的重大革命措施了。美国“纽约时报”威胁古巴人民说：“伤害美国人的措施将不会有利于古巴人”。美国“时代”杂志扬言古巴将会发生另一次“危地马拉事件”。美国前任助理国务卿布莱敦更公然号召“进行另一次革命把菲德尔·卡斯特罗赶走。”而美国政府在最近致古巴政府的照会中，居然对古巴政府在制定土地改革法时“没有设法听取美国在古巴的投资人的意见”表示“遗憾”，并无理要求古巴政府就土地改革法将引起的后果同美国“进一步交换意见”，这充分地暴露了美国干涉古巴内政的无耻嘴脸。
    古巴政府制定土地改革法，这纯粹是它的内部事务，没有任何理由要邀请掠夺古巴农民的血汗的美国糖业公司大老板做顾问。古巴所实行的土地改革是以废除大庄园制度为基础的，而美国垄断资本组织正是掌握了古巴近75％的肥沃土地的头号大庄园主，土地改革法当然不可能不“触犯”这些美国垄断资本的利益，然而这是天经地义的事情！
    土地改革是古巴革命的一项重大的基本措施。大庄园制度是使得古巴人民长期陷于悲惨生活的穷根。这一制度在古巴是和美国垄断资本的掠夺不可分割地联系在一起的。古巴革命向前发展，就必须实行土地改革；古巴人民要从悲惨生活中解脱出来，就必须挖掉大庄园制度这块穷根。在这次古巴土地改革中，将涉及大庄园主们所拥有的二十二万卡瓦耶里亚（每卡瓦耶里亚约合二零一点二八中国亩）的土地，而其中仅仅是二十三家美国糖业公司所拥有的就有十万八千卡瓦耶里亚。因此，问题很清楚，古巴的土地改革如果要符合古巴人民的利益，就不能符合美国垄断资本的利益；如果古巴实行土地改革要听取美国垄断资本的意见，那就无异与虎谋皮！
    美帝国主义这次对古巴土地改革所进行的干涉，是从它干涉古巴惩治战犯的活动一脉相承下来的。其目的不仅在于阻挠古巴政府实行符合古巴人民的利益的政策，而且还企图通过这些打着“反共产主义威胁”的幌子的干涉行动，来制造其他拉丁美洲国家的统治者对古巴的疑惧和仇恨，分化古巴各阶层人民的团结，以便在古巴重演1954年武装颠复危地马拉阿本斯政府的故事。现在，美国除了对古巴政府施加政治上和经济上的种种压力，勾结古巴封建大庄园主进行抗拒土地改革的活动，企图直接破坏土改之外，正积极进行国际武装干涉古巴的阴谋。美国参议院最近通过决议，准备拨出二千九百五十万美元“贷款”，用来建立一支所谓美洲国家“警察部队”。提出这项议案的美国参议员马瑟斯毫不掩饰这支部队的枪口是针对着古巴的，他说：“从菲德尔·卡斯特罗上台起，暴风雨就威胁着加勒比海”。美国又指使中美洲六个国家的内政部长举行会议讨论“防止共产主义”对加勒比海地区的“渗透”，其矛头不言而喻也是针对着古巴的。同时，美国正加紧增援它在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地，严重地威胁着古巴和拉丁美洲地区的和平安全。
    古巴人民和政府在美帝国主义的这种无耻干涉和恫吓的面前，表现了极大的勇气。卡斯特罗总理豪迈地宣称，古巴“不会改动土地改革法的一个逗点”；古巴人民正在动员起来为保卫革命、保卫土地改革而斗争。古巴人民的事业是正义的事业，全拉丁美洲的人民都在支持他们的斗争，全世界的人民都在同情他们的斗争。卡斯特罗总理指出：虽然土地改革引起了反对，但是“敌人却正好刺激了革命前进”。对！任何敌人，哪怕是凶恶的美帝国主义，也决挡不住古巴人民前进，美帝国主义的无耻干涉，必将为团结一致的古巴人民力量所粉碎！
