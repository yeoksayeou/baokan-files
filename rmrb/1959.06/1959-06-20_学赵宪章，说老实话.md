    Learn from Zhao Xianzhang, Tell the Truth
    Yi Huai
    Zhao Xianzhang's noble style of seeking truth from facts and being loyal and honest is worthy of emulation.
    Seeking truth from facts is the only way to understand the actual situation of objective things and master the laws of development of objective things. Zhao Xianzhang's seeking truth from facts is very clear and prominent. That is, to superiors, say good things when things are good, and say bad things when things are bad; to subordinates, listen to good things when they are good, and listen to bad things when they are bad. Whether talking about achievements or shortcomings, he neither exaggerates nor minimizes, one is one, two is two, and everything proceeds from the actual situation. In this way, he can get the help of his superiors and the support of the masses to do his work well.
    The actual situation is always very complex. Our subjective wishes, plans, and decisions are sometimes roughly consistent with the objective situation, and sometimes they are far apart. Things are constantly developing and changing, and originally correct plans and decisions will continue to encounter new problems and difficulties in their implementation. Accurately grasping these situations and constantly revising and supplementing the established plans or decisions according to the actual situation can lead to the expected results in the work; failure to understand these situations, or understanding them but not respecting objective facts, will inevitably lead to poor completion of the work or failure. Therefore, every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre should, like Zhao Xianzhang, proceed from the actual situation in everything, say good things when things are good, and say bad things when things are bad, one is one, and two is two, neither concealing nor exaggerating. If the development of things is consistent with the original expectations of the leadership, it should be reported to the higher level; if the development of things is not completely consistent with the original expectations of the leadership, it should be reported to the higher level in a timely manner; achievements should be reported to the higher level, and shortcomings should also be reported. Even if things are not done well elsewhere, as long as they are indeed done well in one's own area, one should boldly say they are good without fear of causing dissatisfaction among others; conversely, even if the work is done very well elsewhere, but one's own work is indeed not good, one should never conceal the truth because one's own face is not good, or fear being blamed by the leader. Reporting the situation should avoid watching the wind and following the crowd. All personal gains and losses should not be considered, and one should not be afraid of exposing the shortcomings in one's own work, nor should one be afraid of exposing the one-sidedness or other shortcomings in one's own understanding. Only when the shortcomings are exposed can they be corrected. Nor should one be afraid of being criticized for reflecting situations that the leader does not like to hear. In order to uphold the truth and do a good job, why be afraid of being criticized? Moreover, reflecting the real situation will not necessarily be criticized, but may even be supported! When Zhao Xianzhang was carrying out the task of sowing corn this year, didn't he propose amendments to the commune party committee based on the actual situation, and as a result, he got the support of the leadership and completed the task particularly well?
    Not seeking empty fame, reporting truthfully, seeking truth from facts, and understanding the truth are the fundamental reasons why Zhao Xianzhang seeks truth from facts and excellently completes his work tasks. We should seriously study such excellent qualities.

    学赵宪章，说老实话
    易槐
    赵宪章的实事求是、忠诚老实的高尚风格，值得效法。
    实事求是，才能了解客观事物的实际情况，掌握客观事物的发展规律。赵宪章的实事求是，表现得非常鲜明，非常突出。那就是，对上，有好说好，有坏说坏；对下，有好听好，有坏听坏。不论是谈成绩或者讲缺点，都是既不夸大，也不缩小，有一是一，有二是二，一切从实际情况出发。这样，他就能够很好地得到上级的帮助和群众的支持，做好工作。
    实际情况总是十分复杂的。我们的主观愿望、计划和决定有时候和客观情况大体一致，有时候也会相距很远。事情在不断发展变化，原来是正确的计划和决定，在执行中也会不断地碰到新问题和新困难。准确地掌握这些情况，根据实际情况不断地修正补充既定的计划或决定，工作就可能得到预期的成果；不了解这些情况，或者了解了而不尊重客观事实，工作就一定会完成得不好，或者遭到失败。因此，每一个共产党员、革命干部，都要像赵宪章那样，一切从实际情况出发，有好说好，有坏说坏，有一是一，有二是二，既不隐瞒，也不夸张。如果事情的发展和领导上原来的预想一致，要向上反映；事情的发展和领导上的预想不完全一致，更要及时地向上反映；对上级要讲成绩，也要讲缺点。一件事情，即使别的地方都做得不好，只要自己那里确实做得好，就要大胆讲好，而不必害怕引起别人的不满；相反的，即使别处的工作都做得很好，而自己的工作的确不好，也决不要因为自己的面子不好看，或者怕受领导者的责备，而隐瞒事情的真相。反映情况切忌看风色、随大流。一切个人得失都不应该顾虑，不要怕暴露自己工作中的缺点，不要怕暴露自己认识上的片面性或其他毛病，毛病暴露了，才有可能得到纠正。也不要怕因为反映了领导者不爱听的情况而受到批评。为了坚持真理，做好工作，为什么要怕受批评呢？何况反映了真实情况，不一定会受到批评，反而有可能得到支持啊！赵宪章在今年执行播种玉米任务的时候，不是根据实际情况向公社党委提出修改意见，结果得到领导的支持，把任务完成得特别好吗？
    不图虚名，如实汇报，以实求实，了解真情，就是赵宪章实事求是地出色完成工作任务的根本原因。这样的优秀品质，我们应当认真学习。
