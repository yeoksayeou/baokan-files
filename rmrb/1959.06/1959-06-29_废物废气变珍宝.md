    Turning Waste into Treasure
    by Ding Yi, Director of the Shanghai Institute of Chemical Research

    Natural resources, whether organic or inorganic, are rarely purely single substances. Some are mixtures of multiple substances, some are compounds of multiple substances, and some are mixtures of multiple compounds. Therefore, in the process of processing these natural resources for a specific purpose, especially when using chemical methods, many by-products are often produced. Under certain levels of science and technology and production conditions, people can often only utilize these materials within a certain limited range, only utilizing what was considered "useful" at the time, discarding what was considered "useless," or even only utilizing a portion of the "useful" things. To more fully utilize natural resources for the benefit of mankind, the issue of comprehensive utilization of material resources and energy arises.

    The benefits of comprehensive resource utilization are countless. Here are some examples of the wonders of comprehensive utilization. For example, sugarcane can be squeezed for sugar, and molasses can be fermented to produce alcohol, citric acid, and twenty or thirty other organic products. The waste liquid from molasses can be used to extract potash fertilizer. Sugarcane skin can be used to extract expensive sugarcane wax. Sugarcane residue can be made into pulp after extracting furfural and lignin. As everyone knows, furfural and lignin are raw materials for manufacturing plastics, and pulp is a raw material for manufacturing rayon and paper.

    The Jiangnan area is a land of rice. In the past, a large amount of rice husks and rice straw were burned as fuel. However, if rice husks are dry-distilled and rice straw is fermented, furfural, methanol, acetic acid, acetone, tar, rice husk charcoal, alcohol, and distiller's grains can be produced, and gas can also be produced as a by-product. Rice husk charcoal can be made into activated carbon, white carbon black, and glass, and distiller's grains can be used to feed pigs. Once these agricultural products are comprehensively utilized, not only will the output value increase several times, but they will also provide some important materials for clothing, food, and transportation.

    Agricultural production requires a large amount of pesticides. 666 is the pesticide with the largest sales volume and is also the main consumer of benzene. However, when 666 is synthesized by photochemical methods, the utilization rate of benzene is only 8%-12%, and the rest is transformed into isomers with no insecticidal effect. If these isomers are further utilized, they can be made into drugs for preventing black穗 disease, potato germination inhibitors, seed fungicides, monocotyledonous herbicides, highly effective selective herbicides, and plant growth stimulants, etc. In this way, the useless is turned into the useful.

    Natural gas is a very promising chemical raw material. The explosion method can be used to convert natural gas into raw material gas for manufacturing synthetic ammonia, synthetic methanol, and carbonyl synthesis. The higher alcohols and higher fatty acids produced by carbonyl synthesis can be used to manufacture high-grade detergents, saving a large amount of oils and fats. Moreover, the use of the explosion conversion method can also release a large amount of kinetic energy during the explosion conversion. The explosion energy of each cubic meter of natural gas can generate 0.67 kWh of electricity. If a synthesis gas plant equivalent to 50,000 tons of synthetic ammonia is built, it can simultaneously supply 28 million kWh of electricity annually. The beautiful prospects of comprehensive utilization of materials and energy cannot be fully described. With the improvement of production technology and methods, the three terms "waste residue," "waste materials," and "waste gas" in production will gradually disappear.

    Shanghai is an industrially developed, densely populated city, but it lacks natural resources. It consumes a large number of raw materials and produces a wide variety of goods every year. The supply and transportation of materials is a very heavy task. Taking coal as an example, the annual consumption is over ten million tons, most of which is used as fuel, only utilizing a small portion of their heat, and the rest is transformed into smoke and dust, and coal slag pollutes the city air and wastes transportation capacity. If a portion of Shanghai's annual coal consumption—3.3 million tons—is comprehensively utilized for high-temperature coking, 1.35 million tons of metallurgical coke, 1.35 million tons of ordinary coke, and 37,000 tons of ammonium sulfate can be obtained, and 3 million cubic meters of coke oven gas can be obtained daily. If 1.2 million cubic meters of coke oven gas is used to produce hydrogen by deep cooling separation, and then synthesize ammonia, 100,000 tons of ammonia can be produced annually. Together with the by-product ammonium sulfate, it can basically meet the needs of Shanghai's agriculture. Coke oven gas separation can also obtain 5,750 tons of ethylene, 10,000 tons of other olefins, and 80,000 tons of methane annually. In addition, the crude benzene obtained from coal dry distillation is 40,000 tons, phenol is 1,100 tons, naphthalene is 17,000 tons, anthracene oil is 11,000 tons, toluene is 5,600 tons, cresol is 1,400 tons, and solvent oil is 5,000 tons. These are all extremely valuable organic raw materials and can basically meet the needs of Shanghai's organic chemical industry. In addition, 5,500 tons of sulfur powder and 80,000 tons of asphalt can be obtained in the above comprehensive utilization. The remaining coke oven gas, mixed with a portion of water gas from the gasification of ordinary coke, can sufficiently supply civilian and industrial gas for Shanghai. It can be seen that after Shanghai realizes the comprehensive utilization of coal, it not only saves coal consumption, but also partially meets the needs of the iron and steel and chemical industries, which will play a great role in improving people's lives and will make Shanghai a cleaner and more beautiful modern city. The example of coal utilization alone is enough to illustrate the necessity of comprehensive utilization of industrial materials in Shanghai.

    So, can Shanghai gradually realize comprehensive utilization? The answer is also affirmative. First of all, Shanghai is a comprehensive industrial city with many industries and varieties, and it needs a large number of various industrial raw materials, relying on the support of all parts of the country. After the Great Leap Forward, the need for materials has increased even more. It is unimaginable that our industrial production will forever maintain the unreasonable phenomenon of transporting a large amount of materials into Shanghai, only utilizing a portion of them, and then transporting the rest out to be discarded. Therefore, the objective situation also increasingly urgently requires Shanghai's industry to fully, economically, and rationally comprehensively utilize resources. Secondly, Shanghai has a good industrial foundation, and heavy industry has been vigorously developed after liberation. The simultaneous development of light and heavy industries will connect the veins of comprehensive utilization of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products. Third, Shanghai has a considerable number of various specialized scientific research institutions, universities, and factories, with concentrated technical forces and a certain level of science and technology. Shanghai also has a strong team of skilled workers who are making a big splash in the technical revolution and are attacking the technical fortress of comprehensive utilization, and have created extremely valuable achievements and accumulated a lot of experience. Therefore, we firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, strengthening collaboration, and systematically and comprehensively solving the subject of comprehensive utilization from all aspects with leadership and planning is entirely possible.

    The Shanghai Institute of Chemical Research has conducted some research work on comprehensive utilization in the past and present. For example: in the aspect of phosphate fertilizer, starting from the research on extraction of phosphoric acid, systematic research has been carried out on superphosphate, ammonium sulfate from phosphogypsum, fluorine recovery to produce sodium fluorosilicate, cryolite, aluminum fluoride, various phosphates, detergents, and recovery of rare metals, as well as research on recovering nickel and chromium from blast furnace phosphate fertilizer. In terms of sulfuric acid, research has been carried out on recovering waste gas from smelting to produce sulfuric acid, and gypsum to produce sulfuric acid and cement. In terms of potash fertilizer, research has been carried out on extracting potassium chloride and rare metals strontium and lithium from salt lakes; extracting potash fertilizer, sulfuric acid, alumina, and rare metals from alunite. In terms of nitrogen fertilizer, research has been carried out on natural gas conversion to produce acetylene and hydrogen, explosion conversion of natural gas, coke oven gas conversion, and separation of rare gases from air and natural gas. In addition, research has also been carried out on the partial comprehensive utilization of local method coking and coal tar recovery. Forest product chemistry has also studied the comprehensive utilization of forest products such as pine roots, pine needles, and wood chips. However, the work is still far from meeting the needs of the development of the situation.

    From the perspective of Shanghai's industrial and resource conditions, the comprehensive utilization of coal, petroleum waste gas, and seawater is an important way to develop Shanghai's chemical raw material base and promote the high, sophisticated, and large-scale development of Shanghai's chemical industry. We are confident that as long as we are under the unified leadership of the Party, determine priorities based on needs and possibilities, and work together from top to bottom, left and right, and make a big splash in the technical revolution, the comprehensive utilization in the chemical field will surely bear fruitful economic results.

    废物废气变珍宝
    上海化工研究院院长　丁一
    自然界的资源，无论是有机物或者无机物，很少是纯粹的单一物质。有的是多种物质的混合体，有的是多种物质的化合体，也有的是多种化合物的混合体。所以，人们在为了某一目的加工处理这些天然资源的过程中，尤其是用化学方法加工的时候，常常会有很多副产物产生。在一定的科学技术水平和生产条件下，人们往往只能在一定限度的范围内利用这些物资，只利用了其中在当时认为“有用”的东西，把所谓“无用”的东西抛弃了，甚而仅仅利用了“有用”东西中的一部分。为了更加充分地利用自然资源替人类造福，这里就发生了物质资源和能量的综合利用问题。
    资源综合利用的好处难以尽述。这里不妨举一些关于综合利用妙处的例子。例如甘蔗可以榨糖，而糖蜜可以发酵制酒精、柠檬酸等二、三十种有机产品。糖蜜的废液可以提钾肥。甘蔗皮可以提炼价格昂贵的蔗蜡。甘蔗渣在制取糠醛、木质素以后还可以作成纸浆，大家知道，糠醛、木质素是制造塑料的原料，纸浆是制造人造丝和造纸的原料。
    江南一带是稻米之乡，过去大量砻糠和稻草都作为燃料烧掉。可是如果把砻糠干馏，稻草发酵，就可以制得糠醛、甲醇、醋酸、丙酮、柏油、糠炭、酒精和酒糟，还可以副产煤气。糠炭可以制成活性炭，白炭黑和玻璃，酒糟可以喂猪。像这些农产品，一经综合利用，不仅产值会翻几番，而且提供了衣、食、行等方面的某些重要物资。
    农业生产，需要大量农药。六六六是销量最大的农药，也是消耗苯的主要对象。但是用光化法合成六六六，苯的利用率仅8％—12％，其余的都变成无杀虫效力的异构体。如果把这些异构体进一步利用，又可以制成防治黑穗病的药物，马铃薯发芽控制剂，种子杀菌剂，单子叶除草剂，高效的选择性除草剂和植物生长刺激素等等。这样，又变无用为有用。
    天然气是一种极有前途的化工原料。用爆炸法可以把天然气转化成制造合成氨、合成甲醇和羰基合成的原料气。羰基合成制得的高级醇、高级脂肪酸可以制造高级洗涤剂，节约大量油脂。而且采用爆炸转化法，在爆炸转化的同时还可以释放出大量动能，每立方公尺天然气的爆炸能量可以发电0.67度，如果建设一个相当于五万吨合成氨的合成气工厂，就能同时每年供电二千八百万度。物资和能量全面综合利用的美丽前景描述不尽。随着生产技术方法的改进，生产上的“废渣”、“废料”、“废气”这三个名词将会逐渐消失。
    上海是一个工业发达，人口稠密，但又缺乏天然资源的一个城市。每年消耗的原材料和生产的商品品种多，数量大。物资的供应和调运是十分繁重的工作。就以煤来说，每年消耗量在一千万吨以上，绝大部分作为燃料，只利用了它们的一小部分热量，其余的多化为烟尘，煤渣沾污了城市空气，又耗费了运输力量。如果把上海每年用煤量的一部分——三百三十万吨加以综合利用，进行高温炼焦，就可以获得一百三十五万吨冶金焦，一百三十五万吨普通焦，副产硫铵三万七千吨，焦炉气每天三百万立方公尺。如果把焦炉气中的一百二十万立方公尺用深冷分离法制取氢，再合成氨，就可年产十万吨氨。加上副产硫铵，基本上可以满足上海农业需要。焦炉气分离还可每年获得乙烯五千七百五十吨，其他烯类一万吨，甲烷八万吨，再加上煤干馏获得的粗苯四万吨，苯酚一千一百吨，萘一万七千吨，蒽油一万一千吨，甲苯五千六百吨，甲酚一千四百吨，溶剂油五千吨，这些都是极有价值的有机原料，基本上可以满足上海有机化学工业的需要。此外在上述综合利用中，尚可获得五千五百吨硫粉和八万吨沥青。而剩余的焦炉气，混合一部分普通焦气化的水煤气就可充裕地供应上海民用和工业用煤气。可见上海实现煤的综合利用后，不仅节省了煤的消耗，又部分满足了钢铁和化学工业的需要，对人民生活的改善将起很大作用，并且将使上海成为一个更清洁更美丽的现代化城市。仅从煤的利用这一例，已足够说明上海工业物资综合利用的必要性。
    那么，上海能不能逐步实现综合利用呢？回答也是肯定的。首先上海是一个多行业多品种综合性的工业城市，需要大量各种各样工业原料，依赖全国各地支援。大跃进以后，物资的需要更多了。不能想像在我们的工业生产中，会永远保持着把大量物资运进上海，只利用其中的一部分，就把其余的东西再运出去丢掉的不合理现象。因而，客观形势也日益迫切要求上海的工业必须充分经济合理地综合利用资源。其次，上海市工业基础好，解放后大力发展了重工业。轻重工业并举，将使原料，半成品和成品的综合利用脉络相通。第三，上海有相当多的各种专业的科学研究机构、高等学校和工厂，技术力量集中，具有一定的科学技术水平。上海还有一支强大的熟练工人队伍，他们大闹技术革命，猛攻综合利用的技术堡垒，已经创造了极其可贵的成绩，积累了不少经验。所以我们坚信，在党的领导下，加强协作，有领导有计划地从各个方面系统地全面地解决综合利用的课题，是完全可能的。
    上海化工研究院在过去和现在，都进行了一些综合利用方面的研究工作。例如：在磷肥方面从研究萃取磷酸开始，有系统地进行了重过磷酸钙，磷石膏制硫铵，氟回收制氟硅酸钠，冰晶石，氟化铝，各种磷酸盐，洗涤剂，和回收稀有金属以及从高炉磷肥回收镍铬等研究工作。硫酸方面进行了治炼废气回收制硫酸，石膏制硫酸和水泥的研究工作。钾肥方面进行了从盐湖中提取氯化钾和稀有金属锶锂；从明矾石中提取钾肥，硫酸、氧化铝稀有金属等研究工作。氮肥方面进行了天然气转化制乙炔和氢气，天然气的爆炸转化，焦炉气转化以及从空气和天然气中分离稀有气体的研究工作。此外还进行了土法炼焦回收焦油和煤焦油的部分综合利用的研究工作。林产化学方面也研究了松根、松针、木屑等林产品的综合利用。但是，工作还远远赶不上形势发展的需要。
    从上海的工业和资源条件来看，煤、石油废气和海水的综合利用是开拓上海化工原料基地并促使上海化学工业向高、尖、大发展的重要途径。我们确信，只要在党的统一领导下，根据需要和可能，确定重点，上下左右一齐动手，大闹技术革命，这样化工领域内的综合利用一定会结出丰硕的经济果实。
