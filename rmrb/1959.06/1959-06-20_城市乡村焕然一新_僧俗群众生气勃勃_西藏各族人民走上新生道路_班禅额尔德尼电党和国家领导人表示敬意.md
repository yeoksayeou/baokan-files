Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, June 19th: After returning to Lhasa, Panchen Erdini sent a telegram to Party and state leaders to express his respect. The telegram reads as follows: Respected Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou:

Comrade Wang Feng, Deputy Minister, and I safely returned to Lhasa by special plane on June 15th from Golmud in Qinghai Province. During my stay in Beijing to attend the first session of the Second National People's Congress and the first session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I received deep concern and warm hospitality from the central leaders and the people of the capital. To this, I express my heartfelt and high respect.

Through this meeting and visits along the way, I clearly saw that in our great motherland, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, the respected Chairman Mao, and the state leaders, the socialist unity of all ethnic groups has been infinitely consolidated. Any behavior that endangers the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities will surely be spurned and condemned by the people of the whole country and will inevitably suffer the most shameful failure. The armed rebellion premeditated by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique in collusion with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, which betrayed the country and the people, was swiftly and thoroughly crushed, is one example of this. I also clearly saw that the socialist construction cause of our great motherland has achieved brilliant achievements that have shocked the world. Various large-scale industrial systems have been established, and things that we could not manufacture ourselves in the past can now be produced in large quantities. The great development of socialist agriculture is unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. The communization of the people has further promoted the comprehensive development of our people's industry, agriculture, culture, and science with great strides forward. Under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government, and with the kind and vigorous support of the Han people, the people of all ethnic minorities have undergone democratic reforms, completed the socialist transformation, fully realized the rights of national regional autonomy and being masters of their own affairs, and have victoriously embarked on a socialist society of common prosperity and happiness for all ethnic groups. All of this has marked the arrival of a period in which our country will be built into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

After returning to Lhasa, I immediately had many fresh impressions. A very clear, very vivid, very active, and joyous scene is presented in the rural areas and towns of Tibet. When I left Lhasa in early April to go to Beijing for the meeting, the people of Lhasa had just been liberated from the disaster of the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique. In many places, the monks and laity were still struggling with the rebels who were burning, killing, raping, and plundering. Today, although only two months have passed, under the direct leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, with the vigorous support of the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the interior, and with the joint hard work of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet and the Tibetan people, the rebels in various places have been basically eliminated, social order has been stabilized, and the people have lived and worked in peace and contentment. County people's governments and rebellion-suppression production committees have been established in many areas. The Tibetan people have begun to break free from the evil shackles of feudal serfdom and embarked on a new path of being masters of their own affairs. Many people who were forced to beg and wander and who were poor and helpless have gradually received relief from the military control committees and the people's governments in various places and have been introduced to work. Children of farmers and herdsmen have enthusiastically enrolled in schools or actively studied in night schools run by the masses themselves. Under the encouragement of "whoever cultivates the land owns the harvest" and the gradual reform of the cruel old system, the vast number of farmers are full of energy and enthusiasm, and are actively and enthusiastically managing the crops in the fields. Many of the fields that were previously barren have also been reclaimed and cultivated. All of this has transformed the painful, dull, and dark old face of Tibet into a completely new and vibrant one. However, all of this is only the beginning of the Tibetan people's liberation from the violent rule of reactionary feudal serf owners and their embarkation on a new path. Now, the urgent tasks facing our Tibetan people are: on the basis of thoroughly quelling the rebellion, to carry out democratic reform work rapidly, bury the feudal serf system, establish a people's democratic system, and completely liberate the Tibetan people from the feudal serf system. This is an arduous and great revolutionary task. I will certainly abide by the spirit of the central government's instructions, under the direct leadership of the Tibet Working Committee, and under the leadership and efforts of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, unite the monks and laity of all Tibet, and contribute all my strength to the victorious completion of democratic reforms and the gradual construction of a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

I wish Chairman Mao a long life!

I wish the Party Central Committee and all state leaders good health!

Panchen Erdini, Lhasa, June 16, 1959

    城市乡村焕然一新　僧俗群众生气勃勃
    西藏各族人民走上新生道路
    班禅额尔德尼电党和国家领导人表示敬意
    新华社拉萨19日电　班禅额尔德尼在回到拉萨后，致电党和国家领导人表示敬意。电文如下：敬爱的毛主席　刘主席　朱委员长　周总理：
    我和汪锋副部长于6月15日自青海省噶尔穆同乘专机平安返抵拉萨。在我这次出席第二届全国人民代表大会首次会议和政协第三届全国委员会首次会议留居首都北京期间，受到了中央各首长和首都人民的深切关怀和热情招待，对此，我谨表衷心的和崇高的敬意。
    我通过这次会议和往返途中的参观，清楚地看到了我们伟大的祖国，在党中央、敬爱的毛主席和国家领导同志的英明领导下，各族人民的社会主义大团结已无限巩固，任何危害祖国统一和民族团结的行为，必定受到全国人民的唾弃和声讨，必定遭到最可耻的失败。西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派蓄谋挑起的叛国叛人民的武装叛乱，被迅速彻底粉碎，就是一例。我更清楚地看到，我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业，已经取得了震撼着世界的辉煌成就，各项大型工业体系都已建立了，从前我们自己不能制造的东西，现在都已经能大量生产了。社会主义农业的大发展是古今中外从所未闻的。人民公社化更推动了我国人民工农业和文化科学事业大踏步地向前全面发展。各少数民族人民，在党中央和中央人民政府的统一领导下，在汉族人民的亲切大力支援下，经过了民主改革，完成了社会主义改造事业，充分实现了民族区域自治、当家作主的权利，并已胜利地走上了各族人民共同繁荣、幸福的社会主义社会。这一切，已标志着把我国建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义伟大强国的时期，已经到来了。
    我返回拉萨后，立即有了许多新鲜的印象。一种非常显明、非常生动、非常活跃和欢天喜地的景象呈现在西藏的农村和城镇中。今年4月初，我离拉萨去北京开会的时候，拉萨市人民还刚从西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱的灾难中解放出来，不少地方的僧俗群众还在叛匪烧杀奸掠的残害中，与叛匪进行着斗争。今天，虽然只过了两个月，但在中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹备委员会的直接领导下，在内地各兄弟民族人民的大力支援下，在进藏人民解放军和藏族人民共同的艰苦努力下，各地叛匪已基本肃清，社会秩序已安定下来，人民已安居乐业。很多地区已建立了县人民政府及平叛生产委员会。西藏人民已经开始摆脱封建农奴统治的罪恶枷锁，走上了当家作主的新生道路。许多被迫乞讨流浪和贫苦无靠的人，逐步得到了各地军管会和人民政府的救济和介绍参加工作。农牧民子弟踊跃入了学，或在群众自办的夜校中积极进行学习。广大农民在谁种谁收、逐步改革残酷的旧制度的鼓舞下，精神焕发，干劲百倍，积极热情地管理田间的庄稼。以前被荒芜的田地，很多也开垦耕种了。这一切，使西藏痛苦的、沉闷的、黑暗的旧面貌，改变得焕然一新，生气蓬勃了。但是，这一切仅仅是西藏人民从反动封建农奴主暴力统治下解放出来走上新生道路的开始。现在，摆在我们西藏人民面前的迫切任务是：在彻底平定叛乱的基础上，迅速进行民主改革工作，埋葬掉封建农奴制度，建立人民民主制度，把西藏人民完全从封建农奴制度下彻底解放出来。这是一场艰巨的伟大的革命任务。我一定遵照中央的指示精神，在西藏工委直接领导下，在自治区筹备委员会的领导和努力下，团结全藏僧俗人民，为胜利完成民主改革和逐步建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而贡献自己的一切力量。
    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    祝党中央和国家各领导同志身体健康！
                            班禅额尔德尼　1959年6月16日于拉萨
