During this period, newspapers in various regions have published many reports of people's communes actively delivering grain and oil crops. Among these, many people's communes have paid special attention to delivering high-quality grain and oil crops. For example, in Meishan County, Sichuan Province, over 97% of the wheat received by one grain purchasing station was of superior and medium quality. In Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, members of the Chengguan People's Commune put forward the slogan "Dry it in the sun, sift it clean, and never let bad seeds leave the village." The vast majority of the 289,000 jin of rapeseed sold to the state was of superior quality. We believe that this practice is worthy of great promotion. In the work of grain and oil crop purchase, the people's communes and production teams in various regions should learn from these advanced examples.

This year's summer grain and oil crop purchase tasks require quick completion, implementing simultaneous harvesting, threshing, delivery, and transportation. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the delivered grain and oil crops meet the requirements of being dried, winnowed, and with full grains. As everyone knows, poor-quality grain and oil crops can bring various losses to the state and the people, and also affect the completion of the purchase quantity targets. According to past experience, every 100 jin of new grain generally loses two jin of moisture and impurities after being dried and winnowed. If we do not pay attention to drying and winnowing, it is actually equivalent to delivering less grain to the state. Therefore, only by effectively ensuring the quality of grain and oil crops being dry, clean, and full can we truly guarantee the completion of the purchase quantity.

Drying and winnowing grain also facilitates state storage. The state purchases tens of billions of jin of grain every year, and the amount stored is both large and concentrated. If the moisture content of the grain exceeds the standard and there is no time to dry it thoroughly, it will mold and deteriorate, causing losses. Of course, state-level grain departments will have to re-sort and re-dry the grain after receiving grain with high moisture and many impurities. However, the labor force used for sorting and drying still has to come from the countryside. This is obviously more labor-intensive than drying and winnowing the grain once during harvesting and threshing. At present, agricultural affairs are very busy, and doing so is very unfavorable to the arrangement of agricultural production.

The state purchases grain and oil crops based on quality. People's communes and production teams can get higher prices by selling good grain to the state. When Yi'an County, Heilongjiang Province, requisitioned autumn grain last year, the price the members got for selling good grain, after deducting the loss of moisture and impurities, was 293,000 yuan more than selling inferior grain. It can be seen that delivering good grain is also beneficial to the people's communes and individual members.

The bumper harvest of summer grain this year is primarily due to the hard work and continued great leap forward of the broad masses of farmers under the leadership of the Party. At the same time, it is also inseparable from the strong support of various sectors of the national economy for agricultural production. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, on the industrial front, the broad masses of workers and staff have continuously strived to increase production, reduce costs, and improve quality, providing the countryside with a large number of agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, and providing more and more high-quality and inexpensive daily industrial products, all of which the members are satisfied with. Now that the summer grain has been harvested, the members should carefully harvest and thresh it, dry and winnow it, and sell the superior quality grain to the state to support the masses in the cities and industrial and mining areas. Now, on the industrial production front, the broad masses of workers and staff are working hard to improve product quality. All members on the agricultural front should also make great efforts to ensure grain quality. We suggest that people's communes and production teams in various regions launch a quality competition in the process of harvesting, threshing, and delivering grain, so that grain and oil crops and steel machinery can compete with each other in improving quality.

Purchasing grain and oil crops, both completing the quantity and ensuring the quality, is certainly not a simple matter. It is necessary to carry out ideological and political work in a thorough and meticulous manner, properly arrange and organize the labor force, and correctly implement the policy of "superior grain, superior price; inferior grain, inferior price; pricing based on quality." The good implementation of the policy of pricing based on quality can encourage the broad masses of farmers to actively sell good grain; if it is not implemented well, it will dampen the enthusiasm of the farmers. Whether the policy of pricing based on quality can be correctly implemented depends on whether the grain inspection standards are reasonable and whether the method of implementing the policy follows the mass line.

Reasonable inspection standards should be formulated based on the quality of grain stored in previous years and with reference to the general quality of this year's summer harvest grain. The formulation must be realistic and cannot be too high or too low. Moreover, in the same area, too many standards should not be set to avoid the occurrence of unreasonable phenomena such as the same quality of grain having different prices, or even good grain having the price of inferior grain and inferior grain having the price of good grain.

The correct method for implementing the policy of pricing based on quality should be on-site inspection by the commune and democratic grading. Grain departments should help communes and production teams train quality inspectors, who will inspect the grain on-site in the communes and teams. This not only overcomes the shortage of technical inspection personnel, thereby speeding up the progress of the purchase, but also allows for re-sorting and re-drying on the spot if any substandard grain quality is found, avoiding many unnecessary waste of manpower and materials. When implementing price-based pricing, the best way for purchasing personnel is to establish democratic grading organizations in communes or production teams and consult with the masses to negotiate and determine the grade of grain. Many regions did this last year, thereby correctly implementing the policy of pricing based on quality, and the broad masses of farmers were very satisfied.

The broad masses of farmers in our country have always had the glorious tradition of delivering good grain. In the difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, in order to win the victory of the war, the broad masses of farmers saved on food and clothing and rushed to deliver good grain. Today's situation is completely different from that of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. The material life and political awareness of the broad masses of farmers have been greatly improved, and they have shown great enthusiasm for socialist construction. Therefore, we believe that this year's summer grain and oil crop purchase tasks, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels and with the support of the broad masses of members, will be completed on time, with quality, and in quantity, in accordance with the state purchase plan, and achieve a comprehensive victory.

### 把好粮食交售给国家

    把好粮食交售给国家
    这一时期，各地报纸上发表了很多人民公社积极交售粮食油料的消息，其中有不少人民公社特别注意交售上等质量的粮食油料。像四川省眉山县一个购粮点收到的小麦中，上等和中等的占全部收购量的97％以上。陕西省蒲城县城关人民公社社员们提出“晒干筛净，决不让坏籽出村”的口号，卖给国家的二十八万九千多斤菜籽，绝大部分是上等品。我们认为，这种做法值得大大提倡。在粮食油料收购工作中，各地的人民公社和生产队都应当学习这些先进的榜样。
    今年的夏粮和油料收购任务，要求完成得快，实行边收、边打、边交售、边运送。同时还要切实保证交售的粮食和油料合乎晒干、扬净和籽粒饱满的要求。大家知道，粮食油料质量不好，会给国家和人民带来多方面的损失，还会影响收购数量任务的完成。根据历年的经验，每一百斤新粮，晒干扬净后，一般要减少两斤水分和杂质。如果不注意晒干扬净，事实上就等于少向国家交售了粮食。因此，只有切实保证粮食油料干、净、饱的质量，才算是真正地保证完成了收购的数量。
    把粮食晒干扬净，也便于国家保管。国家每年要收购几百亿斤粮食，存储的数量既大又集中。如果粮食所含水分超过了标准，来不及整晒，就会霉烂变质，造成损失。当然，国家基层粮食部门在收到水分大、杂质多的粮食以后，势必要重新整理翻晒。但是，用于整理翻晒的劳动力仍然要从农村来。这样做显然要比收割打场的时候，一次就把粮食晒干扬净，要多费一些劳动力。目前农事十分繁忙，这样做，对安排农业生产是十分不利的。
    国家收购粮食和油料，是依质论价的。人民公社和生产队卖好粮给国家，可以得到较高的价钱。黑龙江省依安县在去年征购秋粮的时候，社员们卖好粮得到的价款，扣除水分、杂质的损耗以外，比卖次粮多得了二十九万三千元。可见，交售好粮，对人民公社和社员个人也是有利的。
    今年夏粮能够获得丰收，首先是由于广大农民在党的领导下鼓足干劲、继续大跃进得来的，同时，也是和国民经济各部门对农业生产的大力支持分不开的。去年大跃进以来，在工业战线上，广大职工群众不断努力增加生产、降低成本、提高质量，为农村提供了大量的农业机械、化学肥料和农药，并且提供了越来越多的物美价廉的日用工业品，这些都是社员们感到满意的。现在，夏粮收获了，社员们正应当精收细打，晒干扬净，把上等的好粮卖给国家，来支援城市和工矿区的群众。现在，在工业生产战线上，广大职工正在为提高产品质量而努力。在农业战线上的全体社员们为着保证粮食质量也应该大干一场。我们建议，各地人民公社和生产队在收打和交售粮食的过程中，开展一个比质量的竞赛，让粮食油料和钢铁机器在提高质量上争相比美。
    收购粮食油料，既要完成数量，又要保证质量，这当然不是一件简单的事情。必须深入细致地做好思想政治工作，妥善地安排和组织好劳动力，要正确地贯彻执行“优粮优价，次粮次价，依质论价”的政策。依质论价的政策执行得好，就能够鼓励广大农民卖好粮的积极性；如果执行得不好，就会挫伤农民的积极性。而能否正确地执行依质论价政策，关键在于粮食检验的标准是否合理和执行政策的方法是否走群众路线。
    合理的检验标准应该根据历年入库的粮食质量，并且参照今年夏收粮食的一般质量来制定。制定的时候必须实事求是，不能过高，也不能过低。而且在同一个地区，也不能规定太多的标准，以避免发生同样质量的粮食，价格不一样，甚至发生好粮次价、次粮好价的不合理现象。
    贯彻执行依质论价政策的正确方法，应该是就社验质、民主评级。粮食部门应该帮助公社和生产队训练验质人员，由这些人就社就队检验粮食。这样做不但可以克服技术检验人员不足的困难、从而加快收购进度，而且一旦发现有粮质不合标准的，还可以就地重新进行整理翻晒，可以避免许多不必要的人力、物力上的浪费。收购人员在执行按质论价的时候，最好的办法是在公社或生产队成立民主评级的组织，同群众一起协商评定粮食等级。去年许多地区这样做了，从而正确地贯彻执行了依质论价政策，广大农民感到非常满意。
    我国广大农民历来有交售好粮的光荣传统。在抗日战争和解放战争的艰苦年代里，为了争取战争的胜利，广大农民群众曾省吃俭用，争先恐后地交售好粮。今天的情况和抗日战争、解放战争时期完全不同了，广大农民的物质生活和政治觉悟都比过去更加提高，对社会主义建设表现了巨大的热情。因此，我们相信，今年的夏粮和油料的收购任务，在各级党组织领导和广大社员的支持下，一定会按照国家收购计划，按时、按质、按量全面地胜利完成。
