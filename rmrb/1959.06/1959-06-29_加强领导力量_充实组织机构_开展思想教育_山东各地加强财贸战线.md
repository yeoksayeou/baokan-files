Jinan, June 28th (report from this newspaper) - Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province are taking measures such as strengthening leadership, replenishing cadre strength, improving financial and trade institutions, and strengthening political and ideological work to strengthen the financial and trade front.

The Shandong Provincial Party Committee recently held a meeting of the first secretaries of municipal and prefectural party committees, requiring all localities to strengthen leadership over financial and trade work. Currently, each level of party committee throughout the province has one or two secretaries specifically managing financial and trade work. The Provincial Party Committee has a secretary of the Secretariat, and the Provincial People's Committee has a vice-governor specifically in charge of financial and trade work. The number of cadres in the Provincial Party Committee's Financial and Trade Department has increased from twenty to more than forty. According to work needs, the Provincial Party Committee has also decided to establish provincial-level production materials supply bureaus and agricultural product procurement bureaus, restore the Handicraft Industry Administration, and simultaneously replenish and improve grassroots financial and trade institutions. Grassroots financial and trade institutions in areas such as Qingdao, Jining, Linyi, Yantai, and Zibo have been basically replenished and improved. A total of 8,374 grassroots financial and trade units, such as grain management offices, tax offices, and bank business offices, have been replenished and improved throughout the province. Many of the financial and trade cadres who were transferred out last year due to the development of the situation have been transferred back to their original units. Various localities have also transferred a group of cadres from other departments to replenish financial and trade institutions, based on work needs, while streamlining institutions and not adding new personnel.

Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province are paying attention to strengthening the political and ideological education of financial and trade cadres. Qingdao, Dezhou, and other places are educating cadres through Red and Expert Schools, clarifying the erroneous ideas of some cadres who believe that "commercial work has no future, is not promising, and is not glorious," and enhancing the cadres' confidence in doing a good job in commercial work. Many people have consciously improved their service attitude. The Linyi Prefectural Party Committee convened a three-level leadership cadre meeting of the commercial system, carrying out a great airing of views, great debates, and great discussions in the spirit of laying out contradictions, resolving knots, setting regulations, boosting morale, and striving for excellence. All attendees wrote letters of determination, guaranteeing to the Party that they would exert greater efforts to make commercial work have a greater leap forward than in 1958.

With the replenishment and improvement of financial and trade institutions and the strengthening of political and ideological work, various businesses have made significant progress. Jinan City is actively arranging the production of daily-use industrial products and non-staple foods, and strengthening service industries. The city has expanded and added 67 clothing stores, added restaurants and barbers to eight larger hotels, and simultaneously replenished and built 14 barbershops and 107 barber stalls. Weifang City has restored more than 100 kinds of small hardware and small general merchandise products.

### 加强领导力量　充实组织机构　开展思想教育  山东各地加强财贸战线

    加强领导力量　充实组织机构　开展思想教育
    山东各地加强财贸战线
    本报济南28日电　山东省各级党委采取加强领导、充实干部力量、健全财贸机构和加强政治思想工作等措施，加强财贸战线。
    中共山东省委不久以前曾经召开市委、地委第一书记会议，要求各地加强对财贸工作的领导。目前，全省各级党委都有一名或两名书记专门管理财贸工作。省委有书记处书记，省人民委员会有副省长专管财贸工作。省委财贸部的干部由过去的二十名增加到四十多名。根据工作需要，省委还决定建立省一级的生产资料供应局、农产品采购局，恢复手工业管理局，同时充实和健全基层财贸机构。青岛、济宁、临沂、烟台、淄博等地区的基层财贸机构已经基本上充实健全起来。全省已充实健全的粮食管理所、税务所和银行营业所等基层财贸单位共有八千三百七十四处。去年因形势发展调出的财贸干部，许多都已调回原单位。各地还根据工作需要，在精简机构和不增加新人员的原则下，从其他部门调剂了一批干部充实财贸机构。
    山东省各级党委注意加强对财贸干部的政治思想教育工作。青岛、德州等地通过红专学校对干部进行教育，澄清了部分干部认为“商业工作没前途，没出息，不光彩”等错误思想，增强了干部们搞好商业工作的信心，许多人自觉地改善了服务态度。临沂地委召开商业系统三级领导骨干会议，本着摆矛盾、解疙瘩、订章程、鼓干劲、争上游的精神，开展大鸣大放大辩论。与会人员全都写了决心书，向党保证：鼓足更大的干劲，使商业工作比1958年有更大的跃进。
    随着财贸机构的充实健全和政治思想工作的加强，各项业务有了显著的进展。济南市积极安排日用工业品和副食品的生产，加强服务性行业，全市已扩大、增设了六十七个服装门市部，在八个较大的旅馆增设了饭店、理发员，同时充实和新建了十四个理发店、一百零七个理发挑。潍坊市已经恢复小五金、小百货产品一百多种。
