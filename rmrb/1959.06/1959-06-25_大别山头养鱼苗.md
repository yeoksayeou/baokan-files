Yuexi is a "mountain county" in the Dabie Mountains. The mountains are high, the ridges are large, and the climate is cold. In the past, the masses did not have the habit of raising fish. Most of the 7,270 irrigation ponds in the county were idle. In the past, the fish eaten by the masses here had to be transported from Anqing, more than 300 miles away, and fish was more expensive than meat. This year, the Yuexi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to mobilize the masses to raise fish. Now, the county's fish fry farm has raised 20 million fish fry.

    大别山头养鱼苗
    岳西是大别山上的一个“山头县”。这里山高、岭大、气候冷，过去群众没有养鱼习惯，全县七千二百七十个灌水塘，绝大多数都闲着。这里群众食鱼，都是从三百多里以外的安庆运来，鱼比肉贵。今年，中共岳西县委决定发动群众养鱼，现在，这个县的鱼苗养殖场，已养殖了二千万尾鱼苗。
