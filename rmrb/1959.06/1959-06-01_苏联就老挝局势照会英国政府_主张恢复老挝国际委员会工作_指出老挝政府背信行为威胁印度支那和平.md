Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 31st. TASS reported from Moscow on May 31st: The Soviet government, in a note to the British government, expressed its conviction that the resumption of the work of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos is one of the most effective measures for properly implementing the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The Soviet government's note on the Laotian situation was delivered to the British Embassy in Moscow on May 30th.

In the note, the Soviet government stated that it fully agrees with the views of the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China that the actions of the Royal Lao Government in violating the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements harbor a serious threat to peace and security in Indochina.

The Soviet government suggests that the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina jointly send a letter to the Lao government, requesting it to abide by the Geneva Agreements and resume cooperation with the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, so that the Commission can continue its work in the near future.

The Soviet government attached a draft of the letter from the two co-chairmen along with the note, and expressed the hope that the British government will agree to this draft letter and provide a response.

    新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科31日讯：苏联政府在致英国政府的照会中表示确信，恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的工作，是妥善地实行关于老挝的日内瓦协议的最有效的措施之一。
    苏联政府关于老挝局势问题的照会已在5月30日交给英国驻莫斯科大使馆。
    苏联政府在照会中声明，它完全同意越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国政府的看法，即老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议和万象协定的行动，孕育着对印度支那和平与安全的严重威胁。
    苏联政府建议，关于印度支那的日内瓦会议的两个主席联名致函老挝政府，要求它遵守日内瓦协议和恢复同老挝国际委员会的合作，以便使委员会能够在最近期间继续进行工作。
    苏联政府随同照会附上两个主席的信件草稿，并且表示希望，英国政府将同意这个信件草稿，并给以答复。
