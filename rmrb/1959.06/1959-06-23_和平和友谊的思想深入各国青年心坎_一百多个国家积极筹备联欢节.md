During the ten days of the Festival, there will be central activities every day, such as striving for peace and friendship, opposing atomic weapons, Women's Youth Day, Colonial Day, Rural Day, and a grand parade. There will be nearly eighty music and dance performances every day alone. If a person watches one performance a day, it will take more than two years to finish watching.

During the preparation period, the international reactionaries, headed by the United States, fearing the ever-expanding influence of the Festival, are openly and secretly carrying out various despicable conspiracies in an attempt to obstruct and sabotage the convening of the Festival. Their conspiracy activities have aroused the vigilance and anger of young people in various countries. The idea of the Festival has been widely rooted in the hearts of the people, and in the face of the strong desire of young people around the world for peace and friendly cooperation, all their destructive conspiracies will be defeated.

    和平和友谊的思想深入各国青年心坎
    一百多个国家积极筹备联欢节
    据新华社讯　第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的准备活动，目前正在全世界约一百三十个国家中展开，有一千二百个国际性的和各国的青年学生团体表示支持联欢节的思想。联欢节的丰富多采的活动项目和活动日程也已经由维也纳联欢节筹备委员会拟订出来。
    第七届联欢节将于7月26日至8月4日在维也纳举行。再过一个多月，来自世界各地的一万七千名左右的男女青年，将要在奥地利的首都见面了。联欢节将是世界各个国家、各种民族的青年为争取和平和友谊的大示威，它将通过各项活动为不同政治和宗教信仰的青年及其组织之间建立更好的谅解。
    目前，各社会主义国家参加联欢节的代表团已陆续组成。苏联预备派遣一个八百人的代表团参加。邻近奥地利的捷克斯洛伐克将有三千五百名代表和旅行者到维也纳去。匈牙利出席联欢节的代表团由四百多人组成，波兰代表团是五百人，保加利亚四百五十人、罗马尼亚三百五十人。德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜、蒙古、越南等国都将派遣代表团参加。
    联欢节的思想也深入到其他一百多个国家的青年中间。拉丁美洲展开了热烈而广泛的联欢节筹备活动，各种不同政治倾向的青年和学生组织都参加了筹备工作。他们将派一千三百名代表远渡重洋来参加联欢节，这些代表代表着拉丁美洲全部二十个国家的各阶层、各行业的男女青年。印度尼西亚和澳大利亚的青年代表团已经动身，预备取道中国前往维也纳。虽然统治集团不断阻挠，美国青年还是组成了一个四百人的代表团，预备前往参加。西德代表团预定的名额是一千人，可是，报名的人已经超过了两万。法国除预备派遣正式代表一千人外，还有很大数目的青年旅行者将要到奥地利去。其他如印度、日本、伊拉克等国的青年也都展开了热烈的筹备活动，决定派遣自己的代表团。此外，包括四百个不同倾向的青年组织的非洲青年理事会也将有代表团参加。
  第七届联欢节的活动规模巨大，花样繁多。在联欢节进行的十天中，每天都有中心活动，如争取和平友谊、反对原子武器、女青年日、殖民地日、农村日、大游行等。单是音乐和舞蹈演出每天就有近八十场之多。如果一个人一天看一场演出，要两年多的时间才能看完。人们将看到来自世界各国的著名艺术团体，如苏联的乌兹别克共和国“春天歌舞团”、波兰的“玛佐夫舍歌舞团”、捷克斯洛伐克的“尤·伏契克合唱团”等表演的精彩的民族歌舞节目，保罗·罗伯逊等许多著名艺术家也将要在联欢节上表演。在联欢节上还要举行“1959年马戏会演”，由各国最优秀的杂技演员按一个统一的节目进行演出。除了文艺演出外，还要举行八个项目的文艺比赛。乌兰诺娃、萧斯塔科维奇等国际著名艺术大师将担任评判委员。
    在联欢节上，还将举行电影展览、电影比赛，组织集邮、儿童美术作品、美术作品、摄影作品等展览，各种行业青年、共同兴趣青年等各种会见，以及各种学术座谈会，专题讨论会，各项学生活动、参观游览等。
    联欢节的青年友谊运动会将有六十个国家的近二千名选手参加。男女比赛项目共有十六个。在这期间，还将举行五种体育活动。包括争取联欢节证章的比赛、国际青年营、摩托车比赛、体育教练会议等。截至最近为止，已经有三十多个国家向联欢节筹委会报告了本国运动员准备的情况。苏联、中国、波兰、法国、西德、挪威、突尼斯、巴西、伊拉克、黎巴嫩等国都将派遣自己的运动代表队参加。
    在筹备期间，以美国为首的国际反动派，由于害怕联欢节日益扩大的影响，公开地和秘密地进行着各种卑鄙的阴谋活动，企图阻挠和破坏联欢节的召开。他们的这种阴谋活动已经引起了各国青年的警惕和愤怒。联欢节的思想已经广泛地深入人心，在全世界青年要求和平和友好合作的强烈愿望面前，他们的一切破坏阴谋必将遭到失败。
