Farewell
    Zhang Wei

    It is now the golden season in the Great Northern Wilderness.
    The time of the hail storms that darkened the sky has passed, and the snow and ice three feet deep that covered the ground has melted. In the evening, we can once again stroll in the beautiful and vast wilderness.
    My companion and I walked side by side, a wide and open road stretching before us, lined with neatly planted pine trees. The road leads directly to the railway, where a station is being built.
    "Do you remember? We came exactly at this time last year, braving the hail storms, bouncing along in a truck; I never thought we would be able to leave by train now," my companion said excitedly.
    I did not answer. Crossing the railway, we walked straight to the small hill in front of us. Beyond that is the Muling River, to the east is the town of Hulin, and to the west is a large expanse of farmland. Looking back north, we see rows of farmhouses neatly arranged on the western slopes. The setting sun turns the houses and the thousands of rows of poplar trees all red. In the autumn, tall buildings will be built here, and when the pine trees grow tall, evergreens in all seasons, the scenery will be even more beautiful.
    "Traveling north and south, from my subtropical homeland to the beautiful and bright Jiangnan, I have traveled almost all over the motherland, but I feel that no place is more attractive than the Great Northern Wilderness. It is so beautiful and so vast; and now this vast land is full of people, full of red flags, full of new buildings. Here, one can feel the heroic spirit and grand ambition of our Communists everywhere!" My companion straightened his chest, deeply inhaled the moist and cold air, and faced the vast grassland.
    I was silent for a while, and recited the lines of poetry that we often recited together when we came to the Great Northern Wilderness:
    "I love my hometown,
    But I love the Great Northern Wilderness even more.
    ..."
    "Yes, our Great Northern Wilderness!" my companion said softly. We leaned closer, and I seemed to hear the beating of my companion's heart, and I was also excited by the long separation that was about to come.
    Ten years ago, my companion and I joined the army together in our hometown. I went to work in the political department of the military sub-district, and he went to the training team for training; later, we followed the local troops to become the main force, broke out of the Min River, and crossed the Yellow River. During my days on the front line of the East China Sea, he joined the Volunteer Army to fight in Korea. When we met again in Beijing after many years of separation, we embraced each other warmly, and his thin arms almost lifted my sturdy body up.
    Accustomed to the life of the army, accustomed to the language of the army, accustomed to the reunions and separations of the army, we took big steps and separated again.
    Spring, the spring of 1958. We were together again in the team that formed the expedition to the Great Northern Wilderness.
    We walked to the Great Northern Wilderness side by side.
    We arrived at a production team.
    In the "A-shaped Mansion" -- a triangular shed, we slept together, and when we went to work, we walked to the fields together. We planted the vegetable seeds sent from our hometown together, and harvested the abundant wheat on the land of the Great Northern Wilderness together. On snowy days, we lamented together for the people of our hometown, who had never seen snowflakes; and when we looked up at the wild geese flying south, we often sent our longing for our hometown along with them. For the prosperity of our new home -- the Great Northern Wilderness, we raised our glasses together on festivals, and drank to the last drop with our comrades-in-arms from Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi.
    I went to the farm headquarters, and he went to the Wanda Mountains to log wood. When he came down the mountain in the spring, he and his comrades-in-arms brought back pine seedlings, and we planted them together along the road, and we especially remembered the little red pine that we planted together.
    We vowed to turn our second hometown -- the Great Northern Wilderness, into the most beautiful place.
    Not long after, he came to see me, but he held my hand tightly and said, "I am going far away again."
    My heart shook, but I deeply understood what was going on.
    The walls were covered with slogans:
    "Respond to the call of the motherland, from the frontier to the frontier!"
    "With the glory of the people of the Great Northern Wilderness, build a prosperous and beautiful Qinghai."
    Qinghai needs people, it needs the backbone forces from the agricultural reclamation front who have been tempered. The Party issued a resounding call, and although the Great Northern Wilderness itself needed people so much, it also generously supported them. Thousands of soldiers re-embarked on the journey, and my companion and comrade-in-arms also resolutely answered the call.
    "When a soldier hears the bugle call, his heart leaps. I am about to embark on a journey again. Nothing in the world can entangle a soldier's heart." He raised his head slightly, his eyes were so soft and deep, and his tightly closed lips were firm and proud.
    The Great Northern Wilderness, what a good breeze, what a good moonlight, as if to send my companion off.
    We walked slowly back to the farm, stepping on the wide and flat road, the small pine trees on both sides swaying in the wind, as if waving to us. Suddenly, he bent down, lowered his head, stroked the little red pine that we had planted together, and said in a low voice: "Goodbye, my Great Northern Wilderness, goodbye, my 850 farm, goodbye, my comrades-in-arms of the Great Northern Wilderness."
    Suddenly, a bright light flashed behind us, the sound shook the earth, and the train roared past.
    I remembered that he would be leaving by train tomorrow morning. Sending a comrade-in-arms on a distant journey, I had no grand words, I only said: "When the red pine grows up, come and see it again, see the new face of the Great Northern Wilderness."
    "At that time, our prosperous Qinghai will certainly be as beautiful and rich as the Great Northern Wilderness, enough to make our motherland proud!" my companion said, holding my hand tightly. A surge of heat hit me, dispelling the chill of the late night.
    Under the moonlight, I saw a pair of eyes shining brightly under my companion's faded military cap.

    离别
    张惟
    现在是北大荒的黄金时节。
    大烟雹遮天的时候过去了，铺地三尺深的冰雪融解了。傍晚，又可以到那美丽辽阔的原野上去散步了。
    我和我的伙伴并肩走着，伸展在我们面前的是一条坦荡荡的大路，路旁栽下了排列整齐的松树。道路一直通到铁路旁，车站正在那里建筑起来。
    “你记得么？去年我们正是这个时候来的，冒着大烟雹，坐在卡车上一颠一簸的；想不到现在出去却可以乘上火车了。”伙伴兴奋地说。
    我没有回答。越过铁道，我们一直走到前面的小山坡上，再前去就是穆棱河边了，东边是虎林县城，西边是一大片庄稼地，回头往北望，但见农场的一排排房子，整齐地布满西岗上，夕阳把房舍和千条万行的杨树，全都映红了。秋天这里大楼盖起来，再等松树长大了，四季常青，那时景色就更加美妙了。
    “走南闯北，从亚热带气候的故乡，到秀丽明媚的江南，几乎走遍了祖国的土地，我却觉得再也没有比北大荒更吸引人的地方了。它是这样美丽，又这样辽阔；而现在这辽阔的土地上又到处是人，到处是红旗，到处是新的建筑。在这里，使人随处可以感触到我们共产党人的豪迈胸怀和宏伟气魄！”伙伴挺起胸脯，深深地呼吸着湿润的寒冷的空气，面向这广阔的草原说。
    我沉默了一阵，念起了我们一道来北大荒时常爱念的诗句：
    “我爱我的故乡，
    但我更爱北大荒。
    ……”
    “是呀，我们的北大荒！”伙伴轻声地说。我们靠得更近了，我好像听见了伙伴的心的跳动，而我也为即将到来的长远的离别激动着。
    十年前，我和我的伙伴一道在故乡参军，我到军分区政治部工作，他去教导队受训；后来，我们又一道随地方部队上升主力，闯出闽江，飞越黄河。我在东海前线的日子，他参加志愿军赴朝作战。当我们阔别多年，偶或在北京重逢时，我们热情地拥抱着，他那瘦小的双臂几乎把我粗壮的身躯举起来。
    习惯了部队的生活，习惯了部队的语言，习惯了部队的重逢和离别，放开大步，我们又分手了。
    春天，1958年的春天。在组成远征北大荒的队伍里，我们又在一起了。
    我们并肩走向北大荒。
    我们到了一个生产队。
    在“人字大厦”——三角形的草棚里，我们睡在一起，上工时，一道迈向田野。我们一同种下了故乡寄来的菜籽，一块儿收刈了北大荒土地上丰收的麦子。飘雪的日子，我们一起为故乡的人惋惜，那里从来没有见过雪花；抬头望南飞的大雁，也常常把我们对故乡的怀念随同寄去。为新的家乡——北大荒的繁荣，节日里我们又一起举杯，和从山东、河南、四川、陕西来的战友同饮而尽。
    我到了场部，他上完达山伐木，春天下山时，他和战友们带回了松树苗，我们又一道在路旁栽种，还特别记住了我们共同种下的那一棵小红松。
    我们发誓要把我们的第二故乡——北大荒，变成为最美丽的地方。
    没有隔多久，他来见到我，却紧紧握着我的手说：“我又要远走了。”
    我心中一震，但我深深地了解这是怎么一回事。
    墙上贴满了标语：
    “响应祖国的召唤，从边疆到边疆！”
    “带着北大荒人的光荣，建设繁荣美丽的青海。”
    青海需要人，需要经过锻炼的农垦战线上的骨干力量。党发出了响亮的号召，虽然北大荒自己多么需要人，也慷慨支援。千百个战士重新走向征程，我的伙伴和战友，也毅然地应征。
    “战士听见了号角声，心就跃动了。我又要跨上征程。世界上没有任何东西能缠住战士的心。”他微微地抬起头，眼睛是那样的柔和而深邃，紧闭的嘴唇坚毅而骄傲。
    北大荒，多好的微风，多好的月色，好像要为我的伙伴壮行。
    我们缓步走回农场，踏上宽阔平坦的道路，两旁的小松树迎风摇摆，像是向我们招手。猛然，他弯下腰，俯下头去，抚摸着我们共同种下的那棵小红松，低声地说：“再见，我的北大荒，再见，我的850农场，再见，我的北大荒的战友们。”
    突然，背后闪起一道亮光，鸣声震地，列车隆隆地响着飞驰而过。
    我想起，明天清晨他就要跨上列车走了。送战友远征，我没有豪言壮语，只说：“等红松长大时，你再来看看吧，看看北大荒的新面貌。”
    “那时，我们繁荣的青海，一定和美丽富饶的北大荒一样，足以使我们的祖国引为骄傲！”伙伴紧紧地握着我的手说。一股热流冲击着我，驱散了深夜的寒意。
    月光下，我看见伙伴的褪色的军帽底下，一双眼睛闪亮闪亮。
