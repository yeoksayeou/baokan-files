Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th: In Guangdong Province, the water level in the severely affected Dongjiang River basin counties of Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, Heyuan, and Dongguan has receded or is continuing to recede. Work to arrange living conditions, restore production, and rebuild homes is being stepped up. At the same time, the people of Guangdong Province are intensifying preparations to cope with the second extraordinary flood that is about to arrive in the middle and lower reaches of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers. Millions of flood control troops are already fighting on the front lines day and night. Currently, the cold air front has entered Guangdong Province. There has been rainfall in the upper reaches of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers, and the Guangxi area is shrouded in heavy rain and rainstorms. It is expected that on the evening of the 21st, a once-in-a-century mega-flood will occur in the middle and lower reaches of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers and the Pearl River Delta region. If this situation occurs, not only will the vast areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers and the Pearl River Delta region be severely affected, but the safety of Guangzhou City will also be seriously threatened.

The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee held an emergency flood control battlefield meeting for relevant areas on the evening of the 18th. The meeting made the following arrangements for the overall flood control struggle: First, focus on reinforcing and defending the dikes that can be defended; second, comprehensively harvest as much early rice as possible in the next few days, especially in areas where the dikes are relatively weak; third, cadres at all levels must make concrete preparations in advance to ensure the safety of people's lives and property, especially personal safety. In short, we must make the greatest efforts to rescue the dikes and reduce the losses caused by the mega-flood as much as possible.

In this flood, the entire province, with the Party, government, army, and people united as one, waged a heroic struggle against the flood disaster. Thanks to vigorous rescue efforts, the 300,000 disaster-stricken people and cadres in the Dongjiang River area, who were surrounded by floods, have basically been evacuated to safe areas. The Air Force, Navy, Civil Aviation Department, and relevant transportation departments dispatched large numbers of aircraft, ships, and boats to rescue the disaster victims day and night. From the 16th to the 19th, the roar of aircraft engines dropping supplies in the disaster area could be heard all day long, from dawn to dusk. Large quantities of food, medicine, and 250,000 pieces of clothing donated by cadres of provincial and municipal organs and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were all airdropped to the disaster area. In the rescue of disaster victims, Party and government cadres in various places demonstrated a heroic, tenacious, and selfless spirit. After Zengcheng County was threatened by floods, Party, government, and military leaders, on the one hand, led the masses to fight floods and rescue the endangered with all their strength; on the other hand, they organized ten boats and more than 840 punts to rescue the surrounded masses from danger. The local garrison also dispatched four gunboats and twenty rubber boats to support, and promptly transferred more than 130,000 people in the county who were surrounded by floods to safe areas.

Currently, the water level in Huiyang, Boluo, and other counties in Dongjiang has receded and is receding. The water level in Huiyang, downstream of the Dongjiang River, dropped from 17.57 meters at 18:00 on the 16th to 15.07 meters at 08:00 on the 20th. The people in the disaster area are starting to arrange their lives and restore production. Nine million catties of rations, seven million catties of seeds, 1.1 million yuan of disaster relief funds, 4 million yuan of flood control funds, and 300 tons of diesel, as well as a large number of medicines, allocated by relevant provincial departments, are being continuously transported to the eleven areas with relatively serious disasters, such as Huiyang, Boluo, and Dongguan. The Provincial Party Committee and various prefectural and county Party committees have sent a large number of cadres to the disaster areas to express condolences and assist in disaster relief and restore production. Of the 150,000 mu of flooded rice fields in Huaxian County, 100,000 mu have basically eliminated waterlogging, and more than 47,000 mu have been treated by washing the rice seedlings. The flooded peanut fields have also been drained in time and lime has been applied. In order to ensure that late rice production is not delayed, all communes in the county have taken emergency measures and replanted 212,000 catties of grain seeds in two days. The main transportation lines in Conghua County have also been repaired and opened to traffic. A working group composed of cadres drawn from the County Party Committee is going deep into the disaster area to express condolences, help the masses arrange their lives, and restore production. Now, the Party, government, army, and people throughout the province are, on the one hand, stepping up arrangements for the lives of the masses in the disaster areas and restoring production; on the other hand, they are urgently mobilizing to form a flood control army of millions, heading to the front lines of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers, raising dikes, and fighting to resist the upcoming mega-flood.

    百年特大洪水威胁珠江三角洲
    广东百万防洪大军正在日夜奋战守堤防险
    东江水势开始消退被困干部群众陆续脱险
    新华社广州20日电　广东省灾情严重的东江流域惠阳、博罗、增城、河源、东莞等县，水势已经消退和正继续消退中，安排生活、恢复生产和重整家园的工作正在加紧进行。与此同时，广东省人民正在加紧准备应付西江、北江中下游即将到来的第二次特大洪水的侵袭，数以百万计的防洪大军已在前线日夜奋战中。目前，冷空气前锋已经进入广东省，西江、北江上游，都曾经降雨，广西地区则在大雨和暴雨笼罩之下。预计在21日晚，百年一遇的特大的洪水将在西江、北江中下游和珠江三角洲地区出现。这一情况出现，不仅西江、北江中下游和珠江三角洲广大地区可能将受到严重灾害，就是广州市的安全也将受到严重威胁。
    中共广东省委18日晚召开了有关地区的紧急防洪战地会议，会议对全面防洪斗争作了如下部署：一、对有可能防守的堤围进行重点加固、重点防守；二、全面抢割，把一切可能收割的早稻尽可能在几天收割下来，特别是堤围比较薄弱的地区；三、各级干部要预先做好保证人民生命财产特别是人身安全的具体准备工作。总之，一面要尽最大的努力抢救堤围，一面要尽最大的可能减少特大洪水所造成的损失。
    在这次洪水侵袭中，全省党政军民团结一致，与洪水灾害作了英勇的斗争。被洪水围困的东江地区三十万灾民和干部，经过大力抢救，基本已撤至安全地带。空军、海军、民航部门和各有关交通部门出动了大批飞机、舰艇和船只，日夜进行抢救灾民。自16日到19日，灾区上空，自晨至暮，进行空投的飞机的马达声终日不息。大批的粮食、药物以及由省、市机关干部和人民解放军官兵捐献的二十五万件衣物，都一一空投到灾区。在抢救灾民中，各地党政干部表现了英勇顽强舍己为人的精神。增城县受到洪水威胁后，党政军领导干部，一面领导群众全力抗洪抢险；一面组织好十艘船、八百四十多只艇，抢救被围群众出险。当地驻军也出动了四艘炮舰和二十艘橡皮艇支援，及时将全县被洪水包围的十三万多群众转移到安全地区。
    目前，东江的惠阳、博罗等县的水势，已经消退和正在消退中。东江下游的惠阳水位从16日十八时的十七点五七公尺下降到20日八时的十五点零七公尺。灾区人民正在着手安排生活，恢复生产。由省有关部门调拨的九百万斤口粮、七百万斤种籽、一百一十万元救灾款、四百万元防洪水利款和三百吨柴油以及大批医药用品，正在源源调运到惠阳、博罗、东莞等十一个灾情比较严重的地区去。省委及各地委、县委派出大批干部到灾区进行慰问和协助救灾，恢复生产。花县十五万亩受淹的稻田中已有十万亩基本排除了渍水，并有四万七千多亩经过洗禾处理，部分被浸的花生田，也及时排除了渍水，施下了石灰。为了保证不误晚稻生产，全县各公社都采取了紧急措施，在两天内就补播了谷种二十一万二千斤。从化县全县的主要交通干线亦已修复通车。由县委抽调干部组成的一个工作组，正深入到灾区进行慰问，帮助群众安排生活，恢复生产。现在，全省党政军民正在一面加紧安排灾区群众生活，恢复生产；一面紧急动员起来组成数以百万计的防洪大军，开赴西江、北江前线，加高堤岸，为抗击即将到来的特大洪水而斗争。
