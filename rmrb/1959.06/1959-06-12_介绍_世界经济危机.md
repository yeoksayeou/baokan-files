    Introducing "World Economic Crisis"
    Edited by Yu. Varga of the Soviet Union, translated by Dai Youzhen and others, published by World Knowledge Press
    Chen Longyuan
    Economic crises of overproduction are the inevitable companion of the capitalist mode of production. "World Economic Crisis (1848-1935)," collectively written by comrades of the Institute of World Economy and World Politics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences under the leadership of Academician Varga, is a book specifically discussing world economic crises. The characteristic of this book is that the authors, based on Marxist-Leninist theory, systematically and scientifically organized the actual data of the entire process of each crisis and cycle, in connection with its history. Through these historical facts, we can observe and analyze the characteristics and changes of each capitalist economic crisis in a more in-depth and specific way. Although this is a historical document, history and reality should not be completely separated. Today's world economic crisis is still the result of the development of internal contradictions in capitalism. Therefore, reviewing the past and comparing their arguments with today's new developments will be of great inspiration to readers who are studying the current world economic crisis. Academician Varga also wrote a preface specifically for the Chinese version of this book, supplementing the two world industrial cycles that have appeared in capitalism in the past two decades, which will further help readers understand the current world economic crisis.
    For more than a hundred years, in general, the capitalist reproduction cycle has been uneven, sometimes even "one step forward, two steps back" as a basic trend. The authors compared the lowest point of each crisis with the highest point before the previous crisis, pointing out that in the period before monopoly capitalism, the lowest point of the crises in each cycle was generally higher than the highest point of the boom in the previous cycle; the crisis had not been so deep as to make the lowest point of the crisis in that cycle fall below the highest point of the boom in the previous cycle. However, with the transition to the era of imperialism, the depth of the crisis deepened, and the lowest points of each crisis became lower and lower, gradually approaching the highest point of the previous cycle; later, when capitalism entered the era of general crisis, in those production sectors that had transitioned to monopoly rule, the lowest points of each crisis were usually lower than the peak of the previous cycle; the most serious world economic crisis of 1929 caused a major setback in capitalist industry, wiping out the achievements of decades of productive forces development. For example, in the United States in 1932 (the year of the lowest point), the general index of industrial production fell by 46.2% compared with the highest point before the crisis, of which the decline in major industrial production sectors was even greater, with pig iron production falling by 79.4%, steel production falling by 75.8%, and new orders for machine tool manufacturing falling by 87.5%. The situation in other countries was roughly the same. In addition to comparing the magnitude of the decline, in order to more fully illustrate the depth of each crisis and the duration of the crisis and depression, the authors also used monthly data to make a detailed comparison of the United States and the United Kingdom.
    Since an economic crisis is the end of a production cycle and the beginning of the next cycle, Academician Varga made a more detailed exploration of the cycles of each crisis, pointing out that each cycle and each crisis has its own specific historical nature determined by many factors. The process of cycles and crises changes as capitalism develops from free competitive industrial capitalism to monopoly capitalism and to the era of general crisis of capitalism. At the same time, between different countries and different production sectors, the occurrence and development of crises are often unbalanced due to the influence of variable factors such as wars, seizure of colonies, agricultural crises, and crop failures, and the cycle of industrial production also changes accordingly. For example, from 1873 to 1895, a total of three world economic crises occurred, but the cyclical form of these three crises was different from the past. The authors believe that the main reason for the changes in the industrial cycle during this period was the influence of the serious agricultural crisis in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Then, from 1895 to 1913, although two crises also occurred, the development speed of capitalist production was very fast. By 1913, the industrial production of various countries had basically reached the highest level before the First World War, but from the second half of 1913, a new decline was approaching. The World War in 1914 interrupted the cyclical process of reproduction. Then the author pointed out that after the First World War, capitalism has entered the period of general crisis, the world has been divided into two parts, and thus two systems have been produced—socialism and capitalism, the result of which is that the specific process of the cycle and the form of the crisis have undergone special changes.
    In the preface to the Chinese version, Academician Varga talked about the cycle after the Second World War, believing that the entire war years did not create conditions for the overproduction of goods. Almost all countries, including the Soviet Union, reduced their industrial production levels after the war ended in the second half of 1945. In order to transition from a wartime economy to a peaceful economy, some military production sectors must temporarily stop production or be converted to civilian production. This transition requires a certain amount of time. Therefore, the postwar cycle should be calculated from 1947. But on the other hand, because more countries were involved in the Second World War, and the degree of damage to production capacity was far more serious than in the First World War, the economic and political conditions between different capitalist countries were very different after the war ended, which made the cyclical progress of these countries vary greatly. He divided these countries into three categories: one, the main defeated countries—Germany and Japan. The war caused them deep pain. In 1947, the industrial production of these two countries was roughly equal to one-third of the 1937 production level. It would take several years to recover to the pre-war level. Two, European industrial countries that suffered heavy losses due to the war—France, Britain, etc. The war caused their production level to fall back to around 1937. After the war, they had to increase production to meet the accumulated non-military needs and recover from the wounds of the war. Three, countries that were not damaged by the war—the United States, Canada, etc. After the Second World War, their production level increased by about 60% compared with the highest pre-war level (1937). Therefore, for the first and second categories of countries, the growth of production was relatively fast after the end of the war, and the United States also actively expanded its military and prepared for war after the war, and massively restored military production, especially the launch of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, which once stimulated industrial production to rise. Therefore, in general, the entire capitalist world was in a stage of rising production for a considerable period of time. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the factors that determine the length of the cycle. Academician Varga proved based on the history of previous cycles and crises that "the duration of the cycle depends on the scale and nature of the renewal and expansion of fixed capital; the more new investment, the longer the upward phase of the cycle, and the more profound and lasting the crisis is usually." He also pointed out that in exploring the duration of the cycle, special consideration should be given to the nature of the renewal and expansion of fixed capital. This point is particularly clear in the case of the United States. The proportion of military expenditure in national income increased rapidly in the postwar period. According to Varga's calculation, it was 6.5% in 1948-1949, 15.8% in 1953-1954, and even more in 1957-1958. The result was inflation. The rapid development of military technology is constantly strengthening the anarchy of production, the畸形 development and instability of production, all of which are the deepening of the crisis in the general crisis stage. This is a resounding slap in the face to those who believe that the American economy can achieve "permanent prosperity." In addition, he also analyzed other characteristics of the postwar cycle.
    It is also worth mentioning that while elaborating on Marx's theory of crisis, the authors resolutely refuted those various anti-Marxist-Leninist "theories" of crisis. These "theories" have new reflections among bourgeois economists and even among those who claim to be Marxist economists after the Second World War. Therefore, criticizing past wrong viewpoints is of great help to improving our theoretical understanding.
    Now, the conditions for the crisis are maturing in most capitalist countries, and the overproduction crisis in the capitalist world has partially begun; corresponding to this is the increasing prosperity of the powerful socialist camp. The world situation is different. As Professor Balogh of the United Kingdom said, "Now the capitalist world is too weak, and if the crisis in the United States drags on, even if it is small in scale, it cannot withstand it." This worry about the prospects of the capitalist world is very natural.
    In short, "World Economic Crisis" edited by Academician Varga is a huge economic work. The authors brilliantly linked the Marxist-Leninist theory of economic crisis with the actual study and analysis of economic crisis, which is worthy of our learning. Although this book was published twenty years ago, there has not been any systematic work on capitalist economic crisis that is more complete than it since then. Therefore, this book is still of great value today.

    介绍“世界经济危机”
    苏联尤·瓦尔加主编　戴有振等译　世界知识出版社出版
    陈龙渊
    生产过剩的经济危机是资本主义生产方式的必然伴侣。苏联科学院世界经济与世界政治研究所的同志们在瓦尔加院士领导下集体编写的“世界经济危机（1848—1935）”，就是一本专门论述世界经济危机的著作。这本书的特点是作者们根据马克思列宁主义的理论，对历次危机和周期的全部过程的实际资料，联系它的历史，进行了系统的科学整理，通过这些史实资料，我们可以比较深入而具体地来观察和分析资本主义历次经济危机的特点和变化。尽管这是一本历史资料，但是历史与现实是不应该截然分割的，今天资本主义世界经济危机仍然是资本主义内部矛盾发展的结果，因此回顾过去，把他们的论点与今天新的发展情况加以对照，这对研究当前的世界经济危机的读者们是会有很大的启发的。瓦尔加院士还特别为这本书的中文版写了一篇序言，补述了近二十年资本主义出现的两个世界工业周期，这就更有助于读者们对当前世界经济危机的了解。
    一百多年来，总的来说，资本主义的再生产周期是升降参差的，有时甚至是“进一步、退两步”这个基本趋势。作者们从各次危机的最低点与前一次危机前的最高点作比较，指出：在垄断资本主义前的时期里，各次周期的危机的最低点，在一般情况下高于前一次周期的高涨的最高点；危机还没有深刻到使该次周期的危机的最低点降到前一次周期的高涨的最高点以下。但是，随着向帝国主义时代的过渡，危机的深刻程度加深了，各次危机的最低点越来越低了，逐渐接近前一次周期的最高点；以后当资本主义进入总危机时代，在那些已经过渡到垄断统治的生产部门，各次危机的最低点通常已低于前一次周期的最高峰；最严重的1929年世界经济危机，就使资本主义工业大开倒车，使过去整整几十年来生产力发展的成就化为乌有。例如，美国在1932年（最低点年分）工业生产总指数比危机前最高点下降46.2％，其中主要工业生产部门下降的幅度更大，生铁产量下降79.4％，钢产量下降75.8％，机床制造业新的订货下降87.5％，其他国家的情况大致也是如此。除了比较下降的幅度以外，为了更详细地说明各次危机的深度、危机和萧条的持续时间，作者们还采用了月度资料专门对美国、英国作了比较详细的计算。
    既然经济危机是一个生产周期的结束，是下一个周期的开始，因此瓦尔加院士对历次危机的周期作了比较详细的探讨，他指出每个周期和每次危机都有它的由许多因素决定的具体的历史性。周期和危机的过程，随着资本主义由自由的竞争的工业资本主义向垄断资本主义、向资本主义总危机的时代发展而发生变化。同时，在不同国家和不同的生产部门之间，往往因战争、侵占殖民地、农业危机和歉收等变动因素的影响，危机的发生和发展是不平衡的，工业生产的周期也随之发生变化。例如，从1873年起到1895年间共发生了三次世界经济危机，但是这三次危机的周期形式与过去就有所不同。作者认为影响这个时期工业周期变化的主要原因，即是受十九世纪最后二十年的严重农业危机的影响。接着从1895年起到1913年间虽然也发生了两次危机，但是从资本主义生产发展速度来看是很快的，到1913年各国工业生产量基本上已达到了第一次世界大战前的最高水平，可是从1913年下半年起新的下降又日益逼近，1914年的世界大战打断了再生产的周期性进程。接着作者又指出在第一次世界大战以后，资本主义已进入总危机时期，世界已分为两部分，并由此而产生两个体系——社会主义和资本主义，其结果是使周期的具体过程和危机的形式发生了特殊的变化。
    瓦尔加院士在中文版序言中谈到关于第二次世界大战以后的周期时，认为在整个战争年代里并没有为商品的生产过剩创造条件，几乎连苏联也包括在内的一切国家，从1945年下半年战争结束后，工业生产水平比战前降低了，为了由战时经济向和平经济过渡，必然有一部分军事生产部门要暂时停止生产或改装为民用生产，这种过渡是需要经过一定的时间的，因此战后周期应该从1947年算起。但是另一方面，因为第二次世界大战被卷入的国家比较多，生产能力遭到的破坏程度远比第一次世界大战为严重，所以到战争结束以后，不同的资本主义国家之间在经济上和政治上的条件是极不相同的，这就使得这些国家之间的周期进展也千差万别。他把这些国家划分为三大类，即：一，主要战败国——德国、日本，战争使他们创深痛巨，在1947年这两个国家的工业生产大体上只等于1937年生产水平的三分之一，要恢复到战前水平还需要几年时间。二，因参战而损失惨重的欧洲工业国——法国、英国等，战争使他们的生产水平大约又倒退到1937年前后的水平，战争结束后他们必需增加生产来满足积累下来的非军事需求和恢复战争的创伤。三，没有遭到战争损害的国家——美国、加拿大等，在第二次世界大战以后，他们的生产水平大约比战前最高水平（1937年）还增加60％。因此，对第一、二两类国家来说，战争结束以后，生产的增长是比较快的，而美国在战后也因为积极扩军备战，大规模地恢复军备生产，特别是发动侵朝战争，也曾一度刺激工业生产上升。因此，总的来说，整个资本主义世界，在相当长的时期里生产是处于上升阶段。因此，有必要探讨一下决定周期长短的因素。瓦尔加院士根据历次周期和危机的历史证明，“周期的期限要取决于固定资本的更新和扩大的规模和性质；新的投资越多，周期的上升阶段越长，危机也照例就越深刻、越持久”。他还指出在探讨周期的期限时，特别要考虑到固定资本更新和扩大的性质。这一点在美国的情况看得特别清楚，战后时期军费在国民收入中所占的比重增加很快，根据瓦尔加计算，1948—1949为6.5％，1953—1954为15.8％，1957—1958年则更多，其结果则引起了通货膨胀，军事技术的急剧发展正在不断地加强生产的无政府状态，生产的畸形发展和不稳定状态，所有这些正是总危机阶段危机的深刻化。这就给那些认为美国经济可以“永久繁荣”的人一记响亮的耳光。此外，他还分析了战后周期的其他特点。
    还值得提出的是作者们在阐述马克思关于危机理论的同时，对那些形形色色的反马克思列宁主义的危机“理论”，坚决地进行了驳斥。这些“理论”在第二次世界大战以后，在资产阶级的经济学家中，甚至在那些自称为马克思主义的经济学家中又有新的反映，因此，批判过去的错误论点，对提高我们的理论认识水平是有很大帮助的。
    现在，大多数资本主义国家发生危机的条件正在成熟，资本主义世界的生产过剩危机部分已经开始；与此相对应的，则是强大的社会主义阵营的日益繁荣。世界形势不同了，正如英国巴洛格教授所说的，“现在资本主义世界已过分虚弱，如果美国的危机再拖延下去，即使规模很小，它也是经不起。”这种对于资本主义世界前景的忧虑是很自然的。
    总之，瓦尔加院士领导编写的“世界经济危机”是一本巨大的经济著作。作者们出色地把马克思列宁主义关于经济危机的理论，与经济危机的实际联系起来进行研究分析，这是很值得我们学习的。虽然这本书出版在二十年前，但是自那时以来，直到现在也还没有任何一本有关资本主义经济危机的系统著述比它更完善。因此，这本书在今天说来仍是有重大价值的。
