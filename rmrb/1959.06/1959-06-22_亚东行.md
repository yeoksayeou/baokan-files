A journey southwest from Lhasa, through the Himalayan passes, covering thirteen hundred li by car, leads to Yadong, the "window" of the southwest of our motherland.

Rich and Beautiful Yadong

For people from the interior of the motherland, a trip to Yadong is unforgettable. On the morning of May 31st, we set off from Lhasa in a light drizzle. When the car climbed over the Xugela Mountain, 5,730 meters above sea level between Lhasa and Shigatse, the snow was knee-deep, a world of silver. Looking down from the car, we saw herds of cattle and sheep in the valleys, and wisps of smoke rising from several brown-black tents. After Shigatse, we entered the ancient trade route of Gyangtse-Yadong. As the car passed under the towering third peak of the Himalayas, everyone's hearts were filled with pride for the magnificent mountains and rivers of our motherland. After crossing the Himalayan pass, 4,850 meters above sea level, the car plunged down the valley. In less than a few tens of minutes, we saw a hillside sharply divided into two seasons: the top of the mountain showed no signs of spring, while the hillside below was covered with lush green shrubs.

The car wound down the mountain, spinning and racing, dropping from an altitude of over 4,000 meters to a deep valley of over 2,000 meters. The winding roads, the gurgling streams, and the increasingly dense forests made the wild roses and azaleas along the road sway in the wind, as if nodding to us, truly a beautiful scene. Finally, the car stopped at a "small bridge, flowing water, and a family" – this was Yadong. When we left Lhasa, the highland barley was only three or four inches tall, but here, the highland barley had already sprouted ears and was about to be harvested.

Yadong, located on the southern slope of the Himalayas, is as beautiful as the regions south of the Yangtze River. All the mountain peaks here are covered with a layer of ancient pine and cypress forests. In some mountain streams, the dense forests and wild flower bushes are so thick that even birds can hardly fly through. The forest resources are so abundant that some towering ancient trees have been rotting for years, but no one has touched them. Himalayan pines that are as thick as a hug can reach heights of tens of zhang. Probably because of the climate, the high mountains here are mostly covered with tall cypress trees on the peaks, dense and straight Himalayan pines on the slopes, and the more common Masson pines found in the interior regions at the foot of the mountains.

The People of Yadong Devotedly Love the Motherland

During our visit to Yadong, the strong feelings of the people's love for the motherland left a deep impression on us.

More than seventy years ago, the people of Yadong were the first to rise up and bravely resist the British invaders, writing an immortal page in the patriotic history of the Tibetan people. Even now, the elderly and young people in Yadong are still proud of this. The reporter visited Bai Ma Duojie, an elderly anti-British veteran living in Galinggang, Upper Yadong. He is eighty-nine years old this year and deaf, but he remembers very clearly the events of his youth when he resisted the British invaders. He proudly gesticulated in a cheerful tone, telling us about how he and the people of Yadong resisted the British invaders twice with bows and arrows, broadswords, and rudimentary guns at that time. At that time, the British invaders coerced the people of their colonies to enter from India. The Tibetan local government sent additional troops here, and the Qing government also sent ministers. The people of Upper and Lower Yadong mobilized and blocked the British invaders at every turn. The old man said that when we ordinary people fought, we used red quilt covers as flags at that time, and hung them high on the hills, to show that we would never be unyielding Chinese people. During the second war in 1904, British imperialism even openly proposed to cede Yadong to India. Bai Ma Duojie said that at that time, the people of Yadong resolutely answered the invaders with broadswords. He himself had bravely killed many British invaders. Although the war was later lost and the British occupied Yadong, the people of Yadong always expressed their determination to be Chinese.

This history of struggle of the people of Yadong in the past has left a deep impression on the younger generation. It is a living epic of patriotic education. We visited some young people in Rupinggang, Upper Yadong. They talked about the oppression suffered by the people of Yadong from foreign invasions in the past, as well as their love for the Communist Party after the victory of the suppression of the rebellion. Some people who went to the interior to study have recently returned. When they talked about the vigorous development in the interior of the motherland, the people in the village were extremely yearning. They wanted to learn everything from the interior of the motherland. This year, the young people of this village took the lead in imitating the people of the interior and planted experimental fields. We visited their experimental fields. In a small plot of highland barley land, the seedlings grew to chest height, with strong stalks and lush leaves. The highland barley had already sprouted ears. These young people are now starting to cultivate and select outstanding individuals, preparing to request to be sent to the interior for study. Da Sang, a member of the Patriotic Youth Federation of this village, said: The Tibetan people are determined to follow the Communist Party. The people in the interior of the motherland are our model. The reactionary upper strata of Tibet want to make Tibet "independent" and split away from the great family of the motherland. This is absolutely not allowed by the people of Yadong and all the people of Tibet.

People Yearn for a New Life

Before the suppression of the rebellion, Yadong was a major transportation route for the reactionary upper strata of Tibet to collude with foreign countries. After the suppression of the rebellion, the residents of Yadong established mass-based public security organizations to assist the military control commission in maintaining social order, monitoring the rebels crossing the border, and mobilizing the masses to protect the mountains and forests. Residents of Xia Sima told us that when the rebellion occurred in Lhasa, they took the initiative to eliminate two rebels. At that time, men and women took up hoes, spears, and kitchen knives, and came out together to block the rebels. Two were killed, and the other seven or eight fled with their tails between their legs to foreign countries. The people of Yadong love the motherland, and this is how they protect their hometown. Therefore, there are no traces of destruction by rebels in Yadong. One night, we saw some activists carrying weapons issued by the military control commission, patrolling the streets. They were always vigilant about the rebels who had fled abroad.

The entire Yadong area has only 966 households. Now, more than 300 people have voluntarily organized to study policy issues related to the suppression of the rebellion and democratic reform, which has become the central topic of discussion for various study groups. We visited some study groups, and the people's strong desire to pursue progress and a new life was very moving. In these study groups, you can see poor farmers over the age of fifty learning Tibetan alphabets and reading newspapers with children in their teens. Che Wangrenxi, the leader of the Xia Sima study group, told reporters that the members of the study group were very active. They proposed to seize the time to study the party's policies and raise their awareness before carrying out reforms, so as to play a greater role in the reforms. Che Wangrenxi's group studies four times a week, two hours each time. The members persevere regardless of wind or rain, and some people, although their lives are very hard, are unwilling to delay their studies because of their own affairs. Group member Dunzhu Luobai said that after studying, he understood one thing: his life was very hard, and he had no land at all. In the past, he thought this was fate, but now he understands that the hardship of life is due to the unreasonable serf system, not fate. Only by reforming this system can there be a way out for life. The people here especially hope to immediately abolish all kinds of bizarre Ula (corvee) systems and feudal possession of mountains, forests, and barren land. Because Yadong is a passage to India, the corvee is particularly harsh, and people are exhausted all year round. In the past, the Kasha and nobles not only dispatched a large amount of corvee to transport foreign goods for them, but also levied a large amount of corvee every year to serve the officials coming and going from the Kasha. In addition to agricultural tax and poll tax, there is also a mule and horse tax, that is, the corvee people have to send out livestock to transport goods from Yadong to Pali for the Kasha and nobles free of charge. When there are no goods to transport, they have to pay the freight in cash. Corvee people who do not have mules and horses have to carry a certain amount of goods from Yadong to Pali every year, called foot tax. When officials arrive in Yadong, they have to pay eggs, called poultry tax. Those who raise cattle and sheep have to pay according to the number of heads, called cattle hoof tax and sheep hoof tax. Those who cut grass have to hand over a certain amount of livestock grass every year, called grass cutting tax. In addition, there are firewood tax, water mill tax, forestry tax, as well as unpaid labor for cooking, sweeping, carrying, and growing vegetables for the officials coming and going.

The Kasha and nobles occupied all the mountains, forests, and barren land in Yadong, and people were not allowed to move a single plant or tree. When the reporter visited Rupinggang, which has more than 100 residents, there was very little land, but there was a fertile wasteland called Linmatang of more than 1,000 mu in front of the village. In the past, it was occupied by nobles, and no one or livestock was allowed to enter, except for birds that could fly over, leaving it barren. After the suppression of the rebellion, this unreasonable situation changed: a herd of yaks is already grazing on Linmatang, and the young people have also cultivated a small plot of experimental fields there. The dark green highland barley seedlings are growing very luxuriantly, and a small plot of rice is also planted next to the highland barley land, preparing to promote it in the Yadong area after the experiment is successful. The peasants happily said: Linmatang has become everyone's. Now they have made a plan for reclamation and will soon turn it all into farmland.

All the villages here are like Rupinggang. After the rebellion was suppressed, the peasants reclaimed wasteland. Some people also planted fruit trees. Many peasants learned from the cadres of the Yadong CCP Party Committee and improved their farming techniques, planting experimental fields of highland barley and potatoes. Fifteen peasant households in Zhongmaiding near Xia Sima also voluntarily organized mutual aid teams to vigorously develop agricultural production.

The people of Yadong are looking forward to reform and a new life. As long as the reactionary serf system is changed, it will not be long before the industrious hands of the people will build it into a beautiful garden on the border of the motherland.

    亚东行
    新华社记者　宫策
    从拉萨西南行，穿过喜马拉雅山口，行车一千三百里，就到了祖国西南的“窗口”——亚东。
    富饶美丽的亚东
    对来自祖国内地的人来说，亚东之行是令人难忘的。5月31日清晨从拉萨出发时，正下着毛毛细雨，当汽车爬上拉萨—日喀则间拔海五千七百三十公尺的旭格拉山时，却是雪深及膝，一片银色世界。我们从车上俯视山下，只见沟谷里牛羊成群，几座棕黑色的帐篷里升起了袅袅炊烟。过了日喀则，就是江孜—亚东古商道。车子经过巍峨的喜马拉雅山第三峰下，人们的心胸都顿然开朗，无不为祖国壮丽的山河而感到骄傲。穿过拔海四千八百五十公尺的喜马拉雅山口以后，汽车顺着峡谷急转直下，不到几十分钟，便看到在一个山的半坡上，被截然地划分了两个季节：山顶不见春意，半山坡以下却是葱绿的灌木林。
    汽车环山而下，盘旋奔驰，从海拔四千多公尺一直下降到二千多公尺的深谷，阵阵盘跎路，潺潺流水声，愈向山下林木愈加茂密，路边的野玫瑰和杜鹃花随风摇摆，仿佛在频频向我们点头致意，真是一番好景色。最后，车停在一个“小桥流水人家”处——这就是亚东。离开拉萨时，那里青稞只有三、四寸高，而这里的青稞早已吐穗，已经是即将收获的季节了。
    亚东在喜马拉雅山南麓，美丽得像江南一样，这里所有的山头都披盖着一层古老的松柏林，在一些山涧边，茂密的林木和野花丛有时简直飞不进一只鸟。森林资源是这样丰富，有些参天的古树不知已朽死多少年，可是并没人去触动它，合抱粗的喜马拉雅松有的高达十几丈。大约因为气候的关系，这里的高山上，山顶多长满高大的柏树，山腰是茂密而笔直的喜马拉雅松，而山下则是内地多见的马尾松。
    亚东人民倾心爱祖国
    来到亚东访问的几天中，人民热爱祖国的强烈情感，给我们留下了突出的印象。
    七十多年以前，亚东人民曾经首先起来英勇抵抗英国侵略军，在西藏人民的爱国史上写下了不朽的一页。直到现在，亚东的老年人和年轻人都还为此而骄傲。记者访问了居住在上亚东噶岭岗的抗英老人白玛多杰，他今年八十九岁，耳朵已聋，可是对他年青时抵抗英国侵略军的事却记得非常清楚，他十分自豪地以爽朗的声调比划着手势，向我们讲述了他自己以及亚东人民当时用弓箭、大刀和土枪两次抵抗英国侵略军的情形。当时，英国侵略军裹胁了它殖民地的人民从印度入境，西藏地方政府向这里增派了军队，清政府也派来了大臣，上下亚东的人民都动员起来，节节阻击英国侵略军。老人说，我们老百姓打仗时，当时用红被面当作旗帜，在山岗上高高挂起，表示我们永远是不屈服的中国人。在1904年第二次战争时，英帝国主义甚至公然提出要把亚东割给印度。白玛多杰说，当时，亚东人民坚决地用大刀回答了侵略者，他自己就曾经勇敢地砍死了许多英国侵略军。后来战争虽然失败了，英国人占领了亚东，可是亚东人民始终表示要坚决做一个中国人。
    亚东人民过去的这段斗争历史，在后起的一代人中留下了深刻的印象。这是一页活的爱国主义教育的史篇。我们在上亚东的如丙岗访问了一些青年人，他们谈到了亚东人民过去受外国侵略压迫的情况，以及平叛胜利以后热爱共产党的心情。这里有些到内地学习的人最近回来，讲到祖国内地蓬勃发展的情况时，村里的人都向往极了。祖国内地的一切东西他们都想学，今年，这个村的青年带头效法内地人民种了试验田。我们参观了他们的试验田，在一块不大的青稞地上，禾苗长得齐胸高，秆壮叶肥，青稞已经吐穗。这些青年人现在正在着手培养和挑选优秀分子，准备请求送到内地去学习。这个村的爱国青年联谊会会员达桑说：西藏人民都坚决跟着共产党走，祖国内地人民就是我们的榜样，西藏上层反动集团想要使西藏“独立”，从祖国大家庭里分裂出去，这是亚东人民和全西藏人民都绝对不能允许的。
    人民向往新生活
    叛乱平息以前，亚东曾经是西藏上层反动分子里通外国的交通要道。平叛以后，亚东居民建立了群众性的治安组织，协助军管会维持社会秩序，监视越境的叛匪，并且发动群众保护山林。下司马的居民告诉我们说，在拉萨叛乱发生的时候，他们曾经自动起来消灭了两个叛匪，当时男男女女拿起锄头、长矛和菜刀，一齐出来堵击叛匪，两个被打死了，另外七八个夹着尾巴逃到了外国。亚东人民热爱祖国，他们就是这样保卫了自己的家乡，所以在亚东看不到有叛匪破坏的痕迹。在一天的夜晚，我们看到一些积极分子携带着军管会发给的武器，在街上巡逻，他们对于逃到外国的叛匪时刻保持着警惕。
    整个亚东地区只有九百六十六户人家，现在有三百多人自动组织起来学习有关平叛和民主改革等政策问题，成了各个学习小组讨论的中心议题。我们访问了一些学习小组，人们那种追求进步、追求新生活的强烈愿望，令人十分感动。在这些学习小组里，可以看到五十岁以上的贫苦农民同十几岁的孩子在一起学藏文字母，阅读报纸。下司马的学习小组长车旺仁希对记者说，学习组的成员都很积极，他们提出要在进行改革以前抓紧学习党的政策，提高觉悟，以便在改革中起更大的作用。车旺仁希这个小组每周学习四次，每次两小时，组员们风雨不误，有的人虽然生活很苦，也不愿因为自己的事而耽误学习。组员顿珠罗白说，经过学习以后他明白了一件事：他的生活很苦，没有一点土地。以前认为这是命运，现在他明白生活苦是由于不合理的农奴制度，而不是什么命运，只有改革这个制度，生活才会有出路。这里的人民特别希望立即废除各种离奇古怪的乌拉（差役）制度和对山林荒地的封建占有。亚东因为是通往印度的孔道，差役特别苛重，人们一年到头疲于奔命。过去，噶厦和贵族不仅大量地派差为他们运输外货进口，而且每年摊派大量差役为噶厦来往的官员服役。这里除了农业税、人头税等以外，还有骡马税，即是差民每年要派出牲口无偿地为噶厦和贵族从亚东往帕里运货，没货运的时候，要按运费折价交款。没有骡马的差民，每年要从亚东背运一定数量的货物到帕里，名为脚捍税。官员到了亚东，要交纳鸡蛋，名为家禽税。养牛羊的要按头数交款，名为牛蹄税和羊蹄税，割草户每年要交出一定数量的牲口草，名为割草税。此外还有柴火税、水磨税、林业税以及为来往官员服务的炊事差、扫地差、搬运差、种菜差等等各种无偿劳役。
    噶厦和贵族占有了亚东所有的山林荒地，不准人民动一草一木。记者在有一百多户居民的如丙岗访问时，那里土地极少，但是村前有一块叫林马塘的一千多亩的肥沃荒地，过去被贵族占据，除了鸟儿可在上空飞过，人和牲口根本不准进去，任其荒废。平叛后这种不合理的情况改变了：林马塘上已经放牧着一群牦牛，青年们还在那里开垦了一小丘试验田，浓绿的青稞苗长得十分肥壮，青稞地旁还种了一小块水稻，准备试验成功以后在亚东地区推广。农民们高兴地说：林马塘变成大家的了。现在他们已作了开垦的规划，不久就要把它全部变成农田。
    这里的所有村庄都同如丙岗一样，农民们在叛乱平息后都开垦了荒地，有的人还栽植了果树，许多农民向亚东的中共党委机关干部学习，改进耕作技术，种了青稞和马铃薯的试验田。在下司马附近中迈顶地方的十五户农民，还自动组织了互助组，大力发展农业生产。
    亚东人民盼望着改革，盼望着新生活。只要反动的农奴制度一改变，这里不要多久，就会被人们勤劳的双手，建设成祖国边境上一个美丽的花园。
