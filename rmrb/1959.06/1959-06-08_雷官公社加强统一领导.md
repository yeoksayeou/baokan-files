    Leiguan Commune Strengthens Unified Leadership
    Leading cadres and commune members of various teams to discuss production increase plans, grasping the main keys; commune-run farm tool factories and livestock breeding farms provided strong support to various teams; timely inspection and promotion of production, life, and financial management of various teams; using various methods to help production teams with relatively poor foundations develop production; strengthening political work to make every commune member spirited and full of energy.
    (By our correspondent) The Leiguan Commune in Lai'an County, Anhui Province, has strengthened unified leadership and implemented hierarchical management, with both the Commune Management Committee and the production teams playing active and proactive roles in their work.
    What should the Commune Management Committee focus on and how should it strengthen its leadership? The Leiguan Commune Party Committee discussed and studied this, prioritizing the tasks for the Commune Management Committee: Unified arrangements should be made for the commune's production plans, unified arrangements should be made for commune-wide capital construction, enterprises and undertakings directly controlled by the commune must be well managed, leadership over backward teams needs to be strengthened, constant checks are needed on the production, canteens, and finances of various teams, and political and ideological work must also be strengthened. With a clear understanding, the Commune Management Committee tightly grasped the major issues concerning the entire commune. First, it focused on the commune's agricultural production plan. They mobilized the masses to meticulously summarize last year's production experience and, based on this year's favorable conditions, conducted four rounds of discussions and revisions of the plan among cadres and the masses, setting this year's grain production increase targets, making the plan more active and reliable. For example, after research, they believed that this year's water conservancy conditions were good, and there were conditions for manufacturing a large number of advanced tools such as rice transplanters and wind-powered waterwheels. Therefore, they expanded the planting area of rice, a high-yield crop, from 63,000 mu last year to 82,000 mu, accounting for 85% of the total cultivated area, grasping the main key to increasing production. To ensure that the production increase plan was not in vain, they also made short-term arrangements for the long-term plan, seizing the season and linking each link tightly.
    The factories and poultry and livestock farms directly controlled by the commune are led by a commune Party committee secretary and a deputy director, with capable cadres assigned to manage each factory and farm full-time. The production plans of these factories and farms are submitted to the Commune Party Committee and Management Committee for careful study. At present, the efficiency of the farm tool factory in manufacturing rice transplanters, wind-powered waterwheels, plows, and harrows has increased several times compared to before; this has provided strong support to various teams. The poultry breeding farm can hatch 1.96 million ducks this year, more than six times more than last year; small teams and commune members' families have a reliable source of ducklings they need for raising ducks. The mining of fire-resistant soil, which is operated by the commune and has a wide market and high revenue, is expected to generate 1.2 million yuan in revenue for the whole year.
    The commune also strengthened the inspection and supervision of the production, life, and financial management of various production teams. A year-round inspection team composed of the commune Party committee secretary, production team leader, and commune members regularly goes deep into the fields to inspect production. In order to help production teams improve financial management, the commune also organized a special financial inspection team to check financial expenditures and prevent waste.
    The Leiguan Commune Party Committee and the Commune Management Committee have conducted specific research on the twelve production teams with relatively poor production, and have taken effective measures to help them improve production: (1) Transferring seventeen brigade cadres to strengthen leadership and encourage them to regenerate themselves; (2) Reducing the number of laborers drawn from these teams to participate in commune-wide labor, so as to ensure that they have a certain amount of labor force engaged in intensive farming; (3) The commune should give as much consideration as possible to these teams in the use of chemical fertilizers and public accumulation funds; (4) Helping these teams to engage in water conservancy construction and basic construction. For example, when the commune helped the Shitou Team, it transferred two Party member cadres to lead production in the team, allocated more than 6,000 jin of local fertilizer to the team, and helped them build six ponds and two dams.
    After implementing hierarchical management, Leiguan Commune has strengthened ideological leadership. The Commune Party Committee relies on Party organizations at all levels to strengthen education for cadres through methods such as encouragement, evaluation, and red flag cycle competitions. Each Party branch has a "Red Flag Hall," which takes the completion of tasks in each period as its content, and evaluates it every ten days. A "Five-Good Commune Member" movement is also being carried out among commune members. Therefore, the whole commune, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to commune members, is full of spirit and full of energy.
    After strengthening unified leadership and implementing hierarchical management, Leiguan Commune, now every team strives to exceed production targets, and the 76 factories and farms managed by the commune for each team are also very well managed. Cadres at the commune level can also concentrate on major events and central tasks, breaking out of the circle of trivial affairs; the production teams also feel that the commune leadership is concrete, with many things but not chaos, and can better play an active role.

    雷官公社加强统一领导
    领导各队干部社员讨论增产计划，抓住主要关键；社办农具厂、畜禽繁殖场，对各队作了有力的支持；对各队的生产、生活、财务管理，及时检查促进；用种种办法帮助基础比较差的生产队，发展生产；加强政治工作，使个个社员意气风发，干劲十足。
    本报讯　安徽省来安县雷官公社加强统一领导，实行分级管理，公社管理委员会和各生产队，在工作中都发挥了主动性和积极性。
    公社管委会应该抓哪些事情，从哪些方面加强领导呢？雷官公社党委作了讨论研究，把公社管委会应做的事情排了队：全社的生产计划要作统一的安排，全社性的基本建设要作统一的安排，公社直接掌握的企业和事业必须管好，落后队的领导需要加强，各队的生产、食堂、财务等需要不断检查，还有政治思想工作也必须加强。思想明确了以后，公社管委会就把有关全社的重大事情，紧紧地抓了起来。首先抓紧了全社的农业生产计划。他们发动群众细致地总结了去年的生产经验，又根据今年的有利条件，先后在干部和群众中，对计划进行了四次讨论、修订，定出了今年粮食增产指标，使计划，更加积极可靠。如他们经过研究，认为今年水利条件好，又有大量制造插秧机、风力水车等先进工具的条件，就把水稻这一高产作物的种植面积由去年的六万三千亩扩大到八万二千亩，占耕地总面积的85％，抓住了增产的主要关键。为了保证增产计划不落空，他们还把长计划作了短安排，抓住季节、环环扣紧。
    公社直接掌握的工厂和家禽、家畜场，除有一个公社党委书记和一个副社长分工领导以外，各厂、场都配备了能力较强的干部专职管理。这些厂、场的生产计划都提交公社党委会和管委会认真研究。目前农具厂制造插秧机、风力水车和犁耙等工具的效率都比以前成倍地提高；这对各队作了有力的支持。家禽繁殖场今年可孵出鸭子一百九十六万只，比去年要多产六倍多；各小队和社员家庭养鸭所需要的小鸭有了可靠的来源。由公社经营的销路广、收益大的耐火土的开采，全年预计可收入一百二十万元。
    公社还加强了对各生产队生产、生活和财务管理的检查督促。由公社党委书记、生产队长和社员组成的一个常年检查团，定期深入田间检查生产。为了帮助生产队搞好财务管理，公社还专门组织了一个财务检查组，检查财务开支，防止了浪费现象。
    雷官公社党委会和公社管理委员会，对生产比较差的十二个生产队，都具体地进行了研究，采取了有效的办法，帮助他们提高生产：（一）抽调十七个大队干部加强领导，鼓舞他们自力更生；（二）少抽调这些队的劳动力参加全社性的劳动，以保证有一定的劳动力从事精耕细作；（三）公社在化学肥料和公积金等的使用方面，尽量照顾这些队；（四）多帮助这些队搞水利建设基本建设。如该社帮助山头小队时，抽调两个党员干部到该队领导生产，并拨给这个队六千多斤土化肥，还帮助他们修了六口塘、两个坝。
    雷官公社在实行分级管理后，更加强了思想领导。公社党委依靠各级党的组织，对干部采取了鼓励、评比和红旗循环竞赛等办法加强教育。各个党支部都设有“红旗馆”，以完成每一时期任务为内容，每十天评比一次。在社员中也开展“五好社员”运动。因此，全社从党内到党外，从干部到社员，个个意气风发，干劲十足。
    雷官公社加强统一领导，实行分级管理以后，现在队队都力争超产，由公社交各队管理的七十六个厂、场，也都经营得很好。公社一级的干部也能专心抓大事、抓中心，跳出了繁琐的事务圈子；生产队也觉得公社领导具体，事多不乱，能更好地发挥积极性了。
