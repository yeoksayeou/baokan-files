Dafang Changshi Commune Persists in Diversified Economy
"Barren Land" Becomes Prosperous
(Our newspaper, Guiyang, 8th dispatch) The Changshi Commune in Dafang County, Guizhou, has persisted in the policy of focusing on grain production while comprehensively developing a diversified economy for several years, fundamentally changing this once-called "barren land" of high-altitude mountainous areas.

Now, the Changshi Commune has afforested more than 100,000 mu, accounting for about 60% of the suitable forest area. Among them, there are more than 40,000 mu of economic forests such as tung oil trees, raw lacquer trees, and乌桕 trees, nearly 10,000 mu of citrus, apple, and pear trees, more than 20,000 mu of tea trees, and the rest are fir, pine, and other timber forests. This area also produces more than 100 kinds of wild medicinal materials. Now, there are more than 10 kinds of medicinal materials cultivated artificially, such as Gastrodia elata, Coptis chinensis, and licorice, with an area of nearly 2,000 mu. Cash crops such as flue-cured tobacco, ramie, sugar beet, and peanuts, which were not available in the local area before liberation, have been successfully planted after years of trial planting. This year, nearly 10,000 mu have been planted, accounting for about 15% of the total cultivated land area. In the past, farmers here rarely fed livestock. For example, in the original Changshi Township, there were only three pigs in 1949, with an average of one head of cattle for every five or six households. Since the development of animal husbandry in 1953, the number of cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep in the entire commune has increased significantly. At present, each household has an average of one head of cattle and three pigs. More than 5,000 sheep have also been developed, twelve large pastures and a rabbit farm have been established, and more than 400,000 fish are raised in ponds. As for grain, it has been a bumper harvest year after year.

With the development of agriculture and diversified economy, people's living standards have been continuously improving. In 1951, the average income per person in the entire commune was less than 20 yuan, and in 1958 it rose to 136 yuan. According to the survey and statistics of the three management districts, in farmers' income, the income from diversified economy (excluding industry) only accounted for 25% in 1954, but it accounted for 42% in 1958.

The achievements of diversified economy in Changshi Commune were achieved through long-term efforts under the leadership of the Party. In the spring of 1954, Xue Juming, secretary of the Changshi District Committee of the Communist Party of China, led cadres to survey many mountains and valleys, and conducted investigations and studies on terrain, soil, climate, and various resources. In 1956, he formally proposed a comprehensive plan for developing a diversified economy, developing mountainous production in accordance with local conditions. For example, high mountainous areas pay attention to the development of timber forests, mid-mountains plant more woody oil materials, foothills develop fruit trees and tea gardens, areas with more grass focus on the development of animal husbandry, and plains plant more cash crops. This layout is not only conducive to planting and management but also facilitates the beautification of mountainous areas.

In the process of developing a diversified economy, the commune implemented the policy of "self-reliance and mobilizing the masses" to overcome difficulties such as shortage of funds and lack of experience. For example, in 1954, Shanba Township organized more than 300 laborers to engage in transportation and infrastructure construction for the state, and received more than 2,000 yuan in wages, which was used to purchase more than 700 sheep. Lacking experience and technology, the commune first summarized and promoted local experience, and at the same time organized cadres and the masses to study and visit other places. In the three or four years before 1958, at least ten experience exchange meetings were held every year, and people were sent to other places to "learn from experience."

    大方长石公社坚持多种经营方针
    “不毛之地”一片兴旺
    本报贵阳8日电　贵州大方县长石公社几年来坚持以粮食为主全面发展多种经营的方针，使这个过去号称“不毛之地”的高寒山区根本改观。
    现在，长石公社已造林十万多亩，约占宜林面积的60％左右。其中油桐、生漆、乌?等经济林四万多亩，柑桔、苹果、梨树近万亩，茶叶树二万多亩，其余是杉、松等用材林。这一带还出产一百多种野生药材，现经人工培植的有天麻、黄莲、甘草等十多种药材，面积近两千亩。烤烟、苎麻、甜菜、花生等经济作物，解放前当地根本没有，经过历年试种成功后，今年种植近一万亩，约占总耕地面积的15％左右。过去这里的农民很少喂牲口，如原长石乡在1949年只有三头猪，平均五、六户才有一头牛。自从1953年发展畜牧业以来，全公社牛、马、猪、羊有很大增加，目前每户平均有一头牛、三头猪，还发展了五千多只羊，建立了十二个较大的牧场和一个养兔场，池塘养鱼四十多万尾。至于粮食更是连年丰收。
    随着农业和多种经营的发展，人们的生活水平不断提高。全公社1951年每人平均收入不到二十元，1958年上升到一百三十六元。根据三个管理区的调查统计，在农民的收入中，多种经营的收入（不包括工业），1954年只占25％，1958年占到42％。
    长石公社多种经营的成绩，是在党的领导下，经过长期努力才取得的。1954年春，中共长石区委书记薛巨明带领干部，勘察了许多山头和河谷，进行了地势、土壤、气候和各种资源的调查研究，到1956年正式提出发展多种经营的全面规划草案，因地制宜地发展山区生产。如高山区注意发展用材林，半山多种木本油料，坡脚发展果树、茶园，草多地区以发展畜牧业为重点，平坝就多种经济作物。这样布局既利于种植和管理，又便于美化山区。
    在发展多种经营的过程中，公社贯彻“自力更生、发动群众”的方针，来克服资金短少和经验不足等困难。如1954年山坝乡组织三百多个劳力，给国家搞运输和基本建设，得到工资两千多元，便用来购买七百多只羊。缺少经验和技术，公社首先总结、推广当地的经验，同时组织干部和群众到外地学习参观。在1958年以前的三、四年中，每年至少要召开十多次经验交流会，分头到外地“取经”。
