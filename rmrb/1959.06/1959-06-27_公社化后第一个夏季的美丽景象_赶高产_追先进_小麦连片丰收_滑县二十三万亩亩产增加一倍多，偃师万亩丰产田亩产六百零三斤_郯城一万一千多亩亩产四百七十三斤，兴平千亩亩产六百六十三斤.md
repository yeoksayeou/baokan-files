Xinhua News Agency Report: News of large-scale wheat harvests continues to pour in from Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces. In Huaxian County, Henan Province, the per-mu yield of 230,500 mu of wheat has more than doubled. In Yanshi County, the average per-mu yield of 10,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields in the Old City and Zhai Town communes reached 603 jin. In Tacheng County, Shandong Province, the average per-mu yield of more than 11,000 mu of wheat in the Matou Commune reached 473 jin; the average per-mu yield of 40,000 mu of wheat in the entire commune was 312 jin, an 88% increase over last year. In Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, the average per-mu yield of over 1,100 mu of wheat in the Xinzheng Management Area of the Mawei Commune reached 663 jin and ten liang.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 26th: Huaxian County, Henan Province, which has historically had low wheat yields, has achieved a bumper harvest on 230,500 mu of wheat in 121 high-yield plots across the county. After drying, winnowing, and careful inspection, the average yield per mu reached 235 jin.

Huaxian County is one of the low-yield wheat areas in Henan Province. Most of the land is a flood detention area for the Yellow River and the Wei River, with uneven terrain, prone to both drought and flooding. In 1957, the county's wheat yield increased from an average of 48 jin per mu before liberation to 83 jin, and only increased to over 100 jin last year. After the realization of people's communization, the Huaxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to change the low-yield wheat situation in the county, established 121 high-yield wheat plots in the county's 19 communes, and also established a high-yield plot headquarters, with the secretaries from the county committee to the commune and brigade taking the lead, and strengthening the specific leadership of the high-yield plots by dividing the plots and blocks. Before wheat sowing, the wheat fields in the high-yield plots were generally deep-plowed and leveled, and 10,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied per mu. At the time of sowing, all the bottom moisture was irrigated, and good wheat varieties were generally selected. The general seeding amount was 20 to 30 jin. In the high-yield plots, field projects were also carried out on a large scale to realize the automation of irrigation.

In order to ensure the bumper harvest of wheat in the high-yield plots, a mass scientific management movement of "everyone learning science and everyone mastering technology" was launched throughout the county. The county and commune party committees engaged in large high-yield plots, the production teams engaged in small high-yield plots, large plots nested in small plots, each plot established experimental fields, each wheat field established files, and the county established a mass technical management network with experimental fields leading high-yield plots and high-yield plots leading large fields. In the high-yield plots, 570 experimental fields, 720 scientific research groups, and 885 field scientific research offices were established, and 30 technical training classes were held, with experienced farmers and technicians serving as teachers, training more than 8,600 technicians, achieving one technical research group per thousand mu, one technician per hundred mu, and establishing wheat field management files for each wheat field. Moreover, old farmers, technicians, cadres, and experimenters were constantly organized to conduct field consultations to make wheat field management more detailed.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 26th: A contiguous 10,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields in sixteen brigades of the Old City and Zhai Town communes in Yanshi County, Henan Province, achieved a large-scale and balanced high yield. The actual yield of this 10,000 mu of wheat averaged 603 jin per mu.

This contiguous large-area high-yield field is distributed on both sides of the Luo River, with fertile soil and flat terrain, all irrigated land with two harvests a year. In the past, production here was not balanced, and there was a large gap between the yields of advanced teams and backward teams. Last year's wheat was a very good harvest year, but there were still brigades with per-mu yields below 300 jin. This year, the situation has changed. The teams with originally low yields have also entered the ranks of the advanced. The Huaimiao Brigade of the Old City Commune, whose average per-mu wheat yield was only 288 jin last year, achieved an average yield of 690 jin per mu on 1,430 mu of wheat in the 10,000 mu high-yield field this year.

From planting to harvesting, this 10,000 mu high-yield field conscientiously and practically implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Most of the 10,000 mu of land was deep-plowed more than one chi deep, and the amount of base fertilizer and top dressing applied per mu was more than in previous years; the amount of seeding was generally around 30 jin; watering was basically done at the right time and in the right amount; all the seeds were good varieties; and field management was meticulous and solid.

The production teams responsible for planting this high-yield field launched a warm socialist labor competition from the beginning of deep plowing to harvesting, and successively organized eighteen inspections and evaluations. Each time, while summarizing the achievements and experiences of the previous stage, they studied what should be grasped in the next step and promptly determined the management measures for various types of wheat seedlings. And by grasping the advanced and grasping the backward, they promoted the production teams to catch up with each other and strive for the upstream, always maintaining full enthusiasm and production enthusiasm, so the 10,000 mu high-yield field appeared a widespread high-yield situation.

The achievement of large-area high yield in the 10,000 mu high-yield field was not smooth sailing. In the later stage of wheat growth, natural disasters such as wind, rain, diseases, and insect pests came one after another. Under the leadership of the Party, the commune members waged a tenacious and unremitting struggle against these disasters.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th: Matou People's Commune in Tancheng County has achieved the first season of large-area bumper harvest after communization. The 11,083.7 mu of high-yield wheat fields in the entire commune, after actual measurement and acceptance, produced a total of 5,247,075.5 jin of dry wheat, with an average yield of more than 473 jin per mu.

The commune's cultivation of large-area high-yield fields also drove the general wheat fields. The actual harvest of 40,000 mu of wheat in the entire commune was 12,480,000 jin, with an average yield of 312 jin per mu, an 88% increase over last year.

The reason why the commune's wheat achieved large-area high yield is the result of fully implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Last autumn, most of the wheat fields were deep-plowed, and high-yield fields generally used about 30 jin of seeds, but what they grasped particularly vigorously was the word "manage." After sowing, a series of management measures were taken. In order to meet the fertilizer needs of wheat after dense planting, the entire commune mobilized 20,000 people in winter to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, so that the entire commune's wheat applied an average of more than 6,000 jin of top dressing per mu during wintering, regreening, and jointing, and high-yield fields and some third-class seedlings applied 8,000 to 10,000 jin of top dressing. Before wheat jointing, the entire commune found that more than 3,000 mu of wheat was growing poorly, and the seedlings were yellow and thin; 2,500 mu of wheat were infested with armyworm moths. The entire commune immediately organized forces to apply top dressing and water to the yellow and thin wheat seedlings, and organized professional teams to eliminate the armyworm moths in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 26th: The Xinzheng Management Area of the Mawei Commune in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, has achieved a large-area bumper harvest of wheat this year. The entire management area has 1,161.7 mu of high-yield plot wheat (70% is stubble-returned), and after threshing, drying, and winnowing, the actual harvest of wheat was 770,933 jin, with an average yield of 663 jin and ten liang per mu.

Selecting and replacing good varieties, vigorously grasping the wheat regreening pass, and closely coordinating various agricultural yield-increasing measures are the main experiences of Xinzheng Management Area in achieving a bumper harvest. 75% of the wheat in this management area is selected from good varieties such as 6028 and Nanda 2419. This year, when the wheat regreened, the management area adopted the method of looking at the sky, looking at the land, and looking at the crops to manage the wheat. In previous years, only one regreening fertilizer was applied, but this year, according to the principle of eating less and more frequently, top dressing was applied in two phases and in different amounts, and the time for top dressing was advanced. In previous years, irrigation was not carried out or was carried out in the later stage of regreening, but this year, it was all carried out in the early stage of regreening, which promoted wheat development. In terms of irrigation methods, in previous years, large-scale flooding was used, but this year, furrow irrigation was used, and some even used underground irrigation. Before sowing, all the wheat fields were deep-plowed once, generally to a depth of more than eight cun. Sufficient base fertilizer was applied, generally about 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. The soil was also treated with "666" during sowing to eliminate underground pests. In addition, the amount of seeding was increased from 20 jin in the past to about 30 jin.

The soil quality of Xinzheng Management Area is not good, all of which is black loess. When it is dry, the soil is hard, and when it is flooded, the soil is loose. Through the careful efforts of the commune members, wheat production has been gradually improved year by year. Since this year, the mass movement of high-yield plots has been carried out, and the responsibility system for management has been strengthened, which has also played a great role in ensuring a bumper harvest.

    公社化后第一个夏季的美丽景象
    赶高产　追先进　小麦连片丰收
    滑县二十三万亩亩产增加一倍多，偃师万亩丰产田亩产六百零三斤
    郯城一万一千多亩亩产四百七十三斤，兴平千亩亩产六百六十三斤
    据新华社讯　小麦大面积丰产讯息，继续从河南、山东、陕西三省传来。河南省滑县有二十三万零五百亩小麦，亩产增加一倍多。偃师县老城、翟镇两个公社连成一片的万亩小麦丰产田，平均亩产六百零三斤。山东省郯城码头公社有一万一千多亩小麦，平均亩产四百七十三斤多；全社四万亩小麦，平均亩产三百一十二斤，比去年增产88％。陕西省兴平县马嵬公社新政管理区一千一百多亩小麦，平均亩产六百六十三斤十两。
    据新华社郑州26日电　历年小麦低产的河南省滑县今年全县一百二十一个丰产方的二十三万零五百亩小麦获得丰收。经过晒干扬净，认真检查验收，平均每亩产量达二百三十五斤。
    滑县是河南省的小麦低产区之一。绝大部分土地是黄河、卫河的滞洪区，地势高洼不平，旱涝都成灾。1957年，全县的小麦产量由解放前的平均亩产四十八斤提高到八十三斤，去年才提高到百斤以上。实现人民公社化后，中共滑县县委为改变全县的小麦低产面貌，在全县的十九个公社里建立了一百二十一个小麦丰产方，并且专门建立了丰产方指挥部，从县委到公社、大队都以书记挂帅，分方分块认真加强对丰产方的具体领导。在小麦播种前，丰产方里的麦田普遍进行了深翻，并且进行了土地平整，每亩施底肥一万斤。播种时，全部灌了底墒水，普遍选用了小麦良种。一般下种量二十到三十斤。在丰产方里，各地还大搞田间工程，实现了灌溉自流化。
    为保证丰产方小麦丰收，全县展开了“人人学科学，个个钻技术”的群众性科学管理运动。县和公社党委搞大丰产方，生产队搞小丰产方，大方套小方，方方建立试验场，块块麦田建立档案，全县建立了一个以试验场带丰产方，丰产方带大田的群众性的技术管理网。并在丰产方内建立了五百七十个试验场，七百二十个科学研究组，八百八十五个田间科学研究室，举办了三十处技术训练班，由老农技术员任教师，训练了八千六百多名技术员，做到了千亩一个技术研究组，百亩一个技术员，块块麦田都建立了麦田管理档案。并且不断组织老农、技术员、干部、试验员，到田间会诊，使麦田管理更细致。
    据新华社郑州26日电　河南省偃师县老城、翟镇两个公社十六个大队的一块连片的万亩小麦丰产田，获得了大面积均衡丰产。这一万亩小麦，实打结果，平均亩产六百零三斤。
    这块连片的大面积丰产田分布在洛河两岸，土壤肥沃，地势平坦，全部是一年两收的水浇地。过去，这里的生产并不平衡，先进队和后进队之间的产量有很大距离。去年的小麦是收成很好的一年，仍有亩产三百斤以下的大队。今年情况变了。原来产量较低的队也步入了先进行列。去年小麦平均亩产只有二百八十八斤的老城公社槐庙大队，今年在万亩丰产田中的一千四百三十亩小麦，平均每亩产量达到六百九十斤。
    这块万亩丰产田，从种到收，认真踏实地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。一万亩土地大部分深耕一尺以上，每亩施的底肥和追肥都比往年增多；播种量一般都在三十斤左右；浇水基本作到了适时适量；种子全部是良种；田间管理作得细致、扎实。
    负责种植这块丰产田的各生产队，从麦田深翻开始，直到收割，展开了热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛，先后组织了十八次检查评比，每次都在总结上一段成就、经验的同时，研究出下一步应抓什么，及时定出各类麦苗的管理措施。并且通过抓先进、抓落后的办法，促使各生产队你追我赶，力争上游，始终保持了饱满的热情和生产积极性，因而，万亩丰产田出现了普遍高产的局面。
    万亩丰产田大面积高产的取得，并不是一帆风顺的。在小麦生长后期，风、雨、病、虫等自然灾害接连袭来。社员们在党的领导下，向这些灾害进行了顽强不懈的斗争。
    据新华社济南26日电　郯城县码头人民公社获得公社化后第一季大面积丰收。全社一万一千零八十三点七亩丰产田的小麦，经实打验收，总产干麦五百二十四万七千零七十五斤五两，平均亩产四百七十三斤多。
    这个社培植大面积丰产田，也带动了一般麦田。全社的四万亩小麦，实收结果，总产一千二百四十八万斤，平均亩产三百一十二斤，比去年增产88％。
    这个社的小麦所以获得大面积丰产，是全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”的结果。去秋大部麦田进行了深翻，丰产田一般用种籽三十斤左右，但是他们抓得特别有力的是“管”字。播种后采取了一系列的管理措施。为了满足密植后小麦施肥需要，全社在冬季里出动两万人，积造了大量肥料，使全社小麦在越冬、返青、拔节期间，平均每亩追肥六千多斤，丰产田和部分三类苗追肥八千到一万斤。在小麦拔节前，全社发现有三千多亩小麦生长不好，苗子黄瘦；有二千五百亩小麦发生粘虫蛾，全社立即组织力量，对黄瘦麦苗追肥加水，并组织专业队及时消灭了粘虫蛾。
    新华社西安26日电　陕西省兴平县马嵬公社新政管理区，今年小麦获得大面积丰产。全管理区有一千一百六十一亩七分丰产方小麦（70％是回茬），脱粒后晒干扬净，实收小麦七十七万零九百三十三斤，平均亩产六百六十三斤十两。
    选换良种，大搞小麦返青关，各项农业增产措施密切配合，这是新政管理区获得丰产的主要经验。这个管理区75％的小麦，都是选的六○二八和南大二四一九良种。今年小麦返青时，这个管理区采用看天、看地、看庄稼的办法，管理麦子。往年只追一次返青肥，今年根据少吃多餐的原则，分期分量共施追肥二次，并且提早追肥时间。往年不灌溉或在返青后期灌溉，今年都是在返青早期灌溉，促进了小麦发育。在灌溉方法上，往年大水漫灌，今年是畦流沟灌，一部分还采用了地下灌溉。播种前麦田全部深翻一次，一般深度八寸以上。全部施足底肥，一般每亩施底肥万斤左右。播种时又用“六六六”处理了土壤，消灭了地下虫害。此外，还将下种量由过去二十斤增加到三十斤左右。
    新政管理区土质并不好，全部是黑塿土。天旱时，土质坚硬，遇涝时，土质稀松。经过社员精心努力，小麦产量逐年有所提高。今年以来大搞丰产方运动，加强管理责任制，对保证丰产也起了很大作用。
