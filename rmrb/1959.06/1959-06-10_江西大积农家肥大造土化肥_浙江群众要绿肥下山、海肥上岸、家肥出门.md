(Reported by our newspaper, Nanchang, 9th) Jiangxi's more than 23 million mu of early rice is now in the effective tillering and young panicle formation stage, which is the period when early rice needs the most fertilizer. On the other hand, Jiangxi plans to sow more than 20 million mu of late rice and autumn crops this year, which also requires a large amount of fertilizer. To this end, all parts of the province are implementing a "fertilizer first" approach in the management of early rice fields, mobilizing the masses to find and develop many new fertilizer sources. Currently, 5 million people across the province are involved in accumulating fertilizer, having accumulated 76 billion jin of various farm manures and produced more than 800 million jin of native chemical fertilizers.

According to past experience in fertilizer accumulation, Jiangxi has developed new fertilizer sources, including: 1. Cutting mountain green for composting and utilizing wild green manure. 2. Most counties in the province have peat deposits, which, when dug up and decayed with some lime, become a fertilizer with high nitrogen content and rich organic matter. 3. Aquatic plants grow everywhere in the Poyang Lake area, all of which are tender and good green manure. 4. Returning the stalks of 5 million mu of spring-harvested crops for green manure and rapeseed to the fields as fertilizer. 5. Burning lime and mining gypsum. 6. Shoveling sod to burn fire-earth ash. 7. Processing tea cake (tea oil cake) and utilizing tea cake. 8. Using purple soil (containing a large amount of calcium and available phosphorus and potassium) as fertilizer. 9. Utilizing steel slag as fertilizer and potash feldspar for fertilizer production. 10. Accumulating various fecal fertilizers.

During the summer fertilizer accumulation campaign, various parts of Jiangxi also vigorously restored and expanded native chemical fertilizer plants to increase the production of native chemical fertilizers. According to statistics, there are now more than 200,000 native chemical fertilizer plants in the province in production, basically achieving "every team has a plant."

In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members in accumulating fertilizer and accelerate the progress of fertilizer accumulation, various parts of Jiangxi also widely carried out large-scale comparisons, competitions, and inspections; established a fertilizer accumulation and production responsibility system; stipulated reasonable remuneration; and vigorously reformed fertilizer accumulation and transportation tools.

(Reported by our newspaper, Hangzhou, 9th) Zhejiang Province has launched a high tide of fertilizer accumulation in the campaign to produce 1,000 jin of early rice per mu. At present, more than 1.24 million people across the province have invested in the fertilizer accumulation campaign.

During the large-scale field inspection of early rice in various parts of Zhejiang Province, it was found that some paddy fields were not growing well due to the increased density of planting or insufficient base fertilizer. These third-class seedlings accounted for about 10% of the province's more than 14 million mu of early and mid-season rice area. In order to quickly eliminate third-class seedlings and enable second-class seedlings to catch up with first-class seedlings, a vigorous fertilizer accumulation and production campaign was launched in various places.

In this intensive fertilizer accumulation campaign, the masses were fully mobilized to find tricks, think of ways, and expand fertilizer sources in many ways. All localities have put forward the slogan: "Green manure should go down the mountains, sea (river) manure should come ashore, and household manure should go out the door." According to the different natural conditions of mountainous areas, plains, coastal areas, and lake areas, a large amount of high-quality native miscellaneous fertilizers with high and fast fertilizer efficiency are accumulated and produced. In mountainous areas, various places make full use of the current characteristics of rampant weeds and cut a lot of green grass and tender leaves for composting. In plain areas, large pits are dug in the fields, and fast-acting artificial urea is composted with river mud, green grass, and some animal manure. In the vast coastal areas, waste materials such as stinky shrimp, rotten fish, fish intestines, and squid brine are used to make fish fertilizer. The Lianpan Commune in Linhai County organized more than 20 boats to accumulate sea fertilizer, accumulating more than 700,000 jin of fish fertilizer in half a month. After more than 6,000 mu of third-class seedlings were applied with fish fertilizer, they all turned green and caught up with second-class seedlings.

While intensively accumulating and producing high-quality native miscellaneous fertilizers, various parts of Zhejiang Province have also been manufacturing native chemical fertilizers. Huangyan County has produced more than 3 million jin of various native chemical fertilizers. The Shuitou Commune in Pingyang County has enabled all 87 production teams in the commune to set up factories, producing high-quality native chemical fertilizers, and producing more than 420,000 jin of potassium ammonium sulfate solution and potassium phosphate in one and a half months.

    江西大积农家肥大造土化肥
    浙江群众要绿肥下山、海肥上岸、家肥出门
    本报南昌9日电　江西二千三百多万亩早稻，现在正处在有效分蘖期和幼穗形成期，这是早稻生长过程中需肥最多的时期；另一方面，江西计划今年播种二千多万亩晚稻和秋季作物，也需要大量的肥料。为此，全省各地在开展早稻田间管理中，实行肥料挂帅，发动群众寻找和开辟了许多新的肥源。现在，全省投入积肥的达五百万人，已积各种农家肥料七百六十亿斤，制造土化肥八亿多斤。
    江西根据过去积肥经验，开辟的新肥源有：一、割山青沤肥和利用野生绿肥。二、全省大部分县蕴藏泥炭，只要挖出来加些石灰腐烂，便是含氮量高、有机质丰富的肥料。三、鄱阳湖滨地区到处生长着水草，都是幼嫩的好绿肥。四、留种绿肥和油菜的五百万亩春收作物的秸秆，还田作肥。五、烧石灰、挖石膏。六、铲草皮烧火土灰。七、加工茶枯（茶油饼）、利用茶枯。八、利用紫色土（含有大量的钙和有效磷、钾）做肥。九、利用钢铁炉渣作肥和钾长石制肥。十、积攒各种粪肥。
    在夏季积肥运动中，江西各地还大力恢复和扩建了土化肥厂，增产土化肥。据统计，现在全省已有二十多万个土化肥厂投入生产，基本达到了队队有厂。
    为了充分调动社员们积肥的积极性，加快积肥进度，江西各地还广泛开展大评比、大竞赛、大检查；建立了积肥造肥责任制；规定了合理报酬；大力改革积肥运肥工具。（刘光辉）
    本报杭州9日电　浙江省在开展早稻千斤运动中掀起积肥高潮。目前，全省已有一百二十四万多人投入积肥运动。
    浙江省各地在早稻田间大检查的时候，发现有一部分禾田由于密植程度提高或基肥不足，禾苗生长不好，这些三类苗约占全省一千四百多万亩早中稻面积的10％左右。为了迅速消灭三类苗，并使二类苗赶上一类苗，各地开展了轰轰烈烈的积肥造肥运动。
    在这次突击积肥运动中，充分发动了群众，找窍门，想办法，多方面扩大肥源。各地都提出了：“要绿肥下山，请海（河）肥上岸，叫家肥出门”的口号，根据山区、平原、海滨、湖区等不同的自然条件，积制大量肥效高、肥效快的优质土杂肥。在山区，各地根据目前百草丛生的特点，大割青草、嫩叶沤肥。在平原地区，大挖田头坑，用河泥、青草和一部分畜粪，沤制速效人造尿。在沿海的广大地区，利用臭虾、烂鱼、鱼肚肠、鱿滷等废物大搞鱼肥。临海县连畔公社组织二十多只船积海肥，半个月就积起鱼肥七十多万斤。六千多亩三类苗施上一遍鱼肥后，全部转青，赶上二类苗。
    浙江省各地在突击积制优质土杂肥的同时，纷纷制造土化肥。黄岩县已生产了各种土化肥三百多万斤。平阳县水头公社，全社八十七个生产队，做到队队办厂，制造优质土化肥，一个半月就生产硫酸氨钾水、磷酸钾四十二万多斤。
