    Seize the Opportunity, Replenish Seedlings Where There are Gaps
    Cotton-Growing Expert Zhang Qiuxiang Offers Suggestions to Fellow Cotton-Growing Comrades

    (Shaanxi Daily News) Cotton-growing expert Zhang Qiuxiang recently learned that the phenomenon of missing seedlings in cotton fields in many areas is very serious. She wrote a letter to her fellow cotton-growing comrades, suggesting that they seize the opportunity to do a good job in checking and replenishing seedlings. The letter said:

    In April and May this year, there was a lot of rain and the ground temperature was relatively low, so the phenomenon of missing seedlings in cotton fields in many areas is very serious. Recently, I discovered in Wu Gong County that the lack of seedlings accounts for more than 30% in some cotton fields. This is a serious problem. As people often say, if you have seedlings, you don't have to worry about growth; if you don't have seedlings, you'll be anxious. Therefore, seizing the opportunity to quickly check and replenish seedlings is very important.

    Some people say that it is already too late to replenish seedlings now, and it's impossible to catch up; they also say that replenishing seedlings now is "burning oil for nothing, it's useless." This statement has some truth to it. It is indeed a bit late to replenish seedlings now. But to think that replenishing seedlings now means it's impossible to catch up, and it's completely useless, is not in line with the facts. In 1957, our team planted 270 mu of cotton. As everyone may remember, in May of that year, it rained and then came a cold snap, and cotton seedlings died everywhere. Half of our cotton seedlings were frozen to death. But we did not give up. Holding on to the old idea of replenishing seedlings wherever there are gaps, we replenished four times in a row. It was in this year that we ensured full seedlings, and the cotton yield per mu was twelve jin higher than the ninety-five jin in 1956.

    So what should we do now? I suggest that the brothers and sisters in the cotton-growing areas should seize the opportunity, quickly conduct a comprehensive inspection of all cotton fields, and if you find missing seedlings, hurry to transplant or replant. When replanting, pay attention to properly handling the cotton seeds, using warm water to soak and germinate them; when planting, it is best to use a hoe to spot plant, covering the cotton seeds with moist soil, and do not mix in the dry soil from the surface of the ground, so that the seedlings will emerge quickly.

    She said at the end of the letter: In the previous period, because the ground temperature was low, many cotton seeds did not emerge from the soil, and the seedlings that did emerge were not very vigorous. Now the ground temperature has increased, if we quickly replant, the seedlings will definitely emerge quickly and grow vigorously in the future. After thinning, if we can apply some quick-acting fertilizer to these replanted seedlings, they will definitely catch up with the early-planted seedlings.

### 抓紧时机　缺苗就补  植棉能手张秋香向棉区兄弟姐妹提出建议

    抓紧时机　缺苗就补
    植棉能手张秋香向棉区兄弟姐妹提出建议
    陕西日报消息　植棉能手张秋香最近了解到许多地区棉田缺苗现象十分严重，特写信给植棉地区的兄弟姐妹们，建议抓紧时机，做好查苗补苗工作。信上说：
    今年4、5月间多雨，地温比较低，许多地区棉田缺苗现象十分严重。最近，我在武功县发现有的棉田缺苗占30％以上，这是严重问题。人常说，有苗不愁长，没苗心发慌。所以，抓紧时机，赶快查苗补苗，十分重要。
    有人说，现在补苗已经迟了，赶不上了；还说，现在补苗是“白熬油，不顶啥”。这种说法，有一定道理。现在补苗就是有点迟了。但认为现在补苗就是赶不上了，根本不顶啥，这就不合事实。1957年，我们队里种了二百七十亩棉花，大家也许记得，在那一年5月中，下了一场雨，接着来了一次寒流，到处棉苗死亡很严重，我们的棉花苗就有一半冻死了。但是我们没有泄气，抱着缺苗就补的老主意，连续补了四次。就是这一年，我们保证了全苗，棉花亩产比1956年的九十五斤还高出十二斤。
    现在到底咋办呢？我建议种棉花地区的兄弟姐妹们，都应该抓紧时机，赶快把所有的棉田做一次全面检查，发现缺苗，就赶紧移苗或补种。补种的时候，要注意处理好棉籽，用温汤浸种催芽；种的时候，最好用锄点种，把湿土盖在棉籽上，不要把地皮上的干土掺进去，这样出苗快。
    她在信上最后说：前一个时期，因为地温低，很多棉籽没有出土，出了的苗也不很欢，眼前地温已经提高了，如果赶紧补种上，将来一定出苗快，而且苗子长得欢。定苗后，如能给这些补苗再施点速效肥，一定会赶上早种的苗。
