Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch: According to TASS reports: During the Seven-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union will vigorously develop irrigation and carry out large-scale soil improvement work.

According to the plans already formulated for reclaiming wasteland and grasslands and improving soil, the Soviet Union will irrigate 1.9 million hectares of new arable land in seven years, provide water to approximately 78 million hectares of pasture, and turn 3.6 million hectares of swamp into fertile fields.

According to the Seven-Year Plan, the work of expanding irrigated areas will mainly be carried out in the eastern and southeastern regions, and soil improvement work will mainly be carried out in the northwestern and western regions.

During the seven years, the area of land irrigated in the Turkmen Republic will be expanded to 155,000 hectares, and the area of pastures provided with water will be expanded to 10 million hectares. The Turkmen Republic plans to build several huge reservoirs with irrigation canals, and the land in the Karakum Canal basin will be able to obtain sufficient water. The Sary-Yazyk reservoir with a capacity of 160 million cubic meters, which was recently completed on the Murgab River, has greatly helped to improve the water supply for cultivated land in the Murgab region (in the Karakum Desert). The first phase of the Karakum Canal project is nearing completion. This canal will pass through 400 kilometers of desert and connect the Amu Darya and Murgab rivers, the largest rivers in Soviet Central Asia. The water from the canal can irrigate hundreds of thousands of hectares of new cultivated land. After the implementation of various projects and measures carried out in accordance with the unified plan for the development of Karakum, by 1965, cotton production in Turkmenistan will increase by half, and animal husbandry will be greatly developed.

In the seven years, the Uzbek Republic will irrigate 500,000 hectares of land and provide water to nearly 5 million hectares of land. Due to the construction of the Chuya-Muyunsky and Tashia-Tashsky hydraulic hubs, the irrigation problem of the fertile Khorezm oasis (located at the junction of the Uzbek and Turkmen Republics) and the comprehensive utilization of the water power of the lower reaches of the Amu Darya, the largest river in Central Asia, will be completely resolved.

In order to ensure the water use of state farms established in the southern regions of Siberia and the newly reclaimed areas of Kazakhstan, during the Seven-Year Plan period, a reservoir with a capacity of approximately 6 billion cubic meters will be built on the Syr Darya River, which originates in the Aral Sea in southern Kazakhstan and flows through Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and extends to Kyrgyzstan. The Soviet Union will build an irrigation system in western Kazakhstan and build powerful water pipelines on the Ishim and Irtysh rivers.

In addition to developing irrigation, the Soviet Union also attaches great importance to soil improvement work. In recent years, Belarus and Ukraine have drained approximately 500,000 hectares of swamps. During the Seven-Year Plan period, another 800,000 hectares of swamps will be turned into fertile fields. The Baltic coastal republics will drain 1.63 million hectares of swamps. Soil improvement work will also be carried out on more than 1 million hectares of land in the central and western regions of the European part of the Soviet Union, as well as the Far East region of the Soviet Union.

### 让旱地和牧场得到水源  把千万顷沼泽变为良田  苏联大力发展灌溉改良土壤

    苏联大力发展灌溉改良土壤
    新华社3日讯  据塔斯社报道：在七年计划期间，苏联将大力发展灌溉事业，并展开大规模的土壤改良工作。
    根据已经制订出来的开垦荒地、草原和改良土壤的计划，苏联在七年中将灌溉一百九十万公顷的新耕地，使大约七千八百万公顷的牧场获得水源，使三百六十万公顷沼泽地变为良田。
    按照七年计划，扩大灌溉面积的工作主要将在东部和东南部地区进行，土壤改良工作主要将在西北部和西部地区进行。
    七年中，土库曼共和国受水灌溉的土地面积将扩大为十五万五千公顷，获得水源的牧场的面积将扩大为一千万公顷。土库曼共和国计划建设几个巨大的带有灌溉运河的水库，卡拉库姆运河流域的土地将可以得到充分的水源。不久前在穆尔加布河上建成了容量为一亿六千万公方的萨雷——亚任水库，这一工程的完成大大有助于改善穆尔加布州（在卡拉库姆沙漠）的耕地的供水情况。卡拉库姆运河第一期工程即将竣工，这条运河将穿过四百公里的沙漠，把苏联中亚细亚最大的阿姆河和穆尔加布河连接起来，运河的河水可以灌溉几十万公顷的新耕地。根据开拓卡拉库姆的统一计划而进行的各项工程和措施实现后，到1965年，土库曼的棉花生产将提高一半，畜牧业将有很大的发展。
    乌兹别克共和国在七年中将灌溉五十万公顷的土地，并使近五百万公顷的土地获得水源。由于建设丘亚—穆云斯基和塔希阿—塔什斯基两个水力枢纽，肥沃的花刺子模绿洲（位于乌兹别克和土库曼共和国交界处）的灌溉问题和综合利用中亚细亚最大的河流阿姆河下游的水力问题，将可以得到彻底解决。
    为了保证西伯利亚南部地区和哈萨克新垦区建立的国营农场的用水，七年计划期间，将在起源于哈萨克南部的咸海并流经乌兹别克、塔吉克一直延伸到吉尔吉斯的锡尔河上，修建容量约为六十亿公方的水库。苏联将在哈萨克西部修建灌溉系统，在伊希姆河和额尔齐斯河上修建强大的输水管。
    除发展灌溉事业外，苏联也十分重视土壤改良工作。几来年白俄罗斯和乌克兰共疏干了约五十万公顷的沼泽地，而在七年计划期间，还要使八十万公顷沼泽地变成良田。波罗的海沿岸各共和国将疏干一百六十三万公顷沼泽地。在苏联欧洲部分的中部和西部地区，以及苏联远东地区，也将在一百多万公顷土地上进行土壤改良工作。（附图片）
