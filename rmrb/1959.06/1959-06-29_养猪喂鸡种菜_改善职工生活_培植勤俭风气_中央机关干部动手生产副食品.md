    Raising Pigs, Feeding Chickens, Growing Vegetables: Improving the Lives of Employees and Cultivating a Frugal Spirit
    Central Government Agency Cadres Engage in Side-Line Food Production
    (Our Newspaper reports) To improve the lives of employees, cadres of central government agencies are engaging in vegetable gardening and raising poultry and livestock to develop side-line food production without affecting their official duties.
    Starting last winter and this spring, central government agencies have established vegetable gardens, feed fields, pig farms, poultry farms, and fish ponds in the suburbs of Beijing. They have also built many pig and sheep pens and chicken and duck coops. In the first half of this year, all forty-five units of the agency have planted more than 1,150 mu of vegetables, raised more than 6,000 pigs, and raised more than 46,000 chickens. In addition, some agencies also raise dairy cows, dairy goats, and fish.
    Cadres of all agencies are very enthusiastic about developing side-line food production. In addition to a few administrative cadres who serve as managers of vegetable gardens and poultry and livestock farms, most agencies rely on cadres to take turns participating in productive labor. Some agencies' office directors and department heads take the lead in growing vegetables and raising pigs. Many cadres' family members also participate in side-line food production.
    In the process of developing side-line food production, these agencies have cultivated technical personnel for management and raising poultry and livestock, and organized them to learn about feeding and preventing poultry and livestock diseases. In early June, the State Council Administration of Government Offices Affairs opened a short-term pig and chicken raising training class, with more than 70 cadres and full-time breeders from 44 central government agencies participating. Cadres from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry who participated in productive labor went to the Beijing Veterinary Research Station to study veterinary medicine and invited veteran farmers to guide side-line food production. The survival rate of the livestock they raised is very high. No pigs or cattle have died, and nearly 4,000 chickens have been raised very well, with many chickens already starting to lay eggs.
    Solving the problem of livestock feed is a key issue in the development of side-line food production by agencies. In addition to growing some green feed and miscellaneous grains themselves, the agencies also go to the mountains to collect pigweed, dig wild vegetables, and pick leaves. All agencies feed livestock mainly with roughage and supplemented with fine feed, trying to save grain as much as possible. Some units are striving to achieve self-sufficiency in feed this autumn.
    Although the development of side-line food production by central government agencies has just begun, many agencies have already seen results, improving the lives of agency employees. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry raises more than 100 dairy cows, producing more than 1,500 pounds of milk every day. In addition to achieving complete self-sufficiency for the milk consumption of agency employees and their families, it can also extract a portion to supply market needs. The livestock farms of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Coal Industry have also begun to supply milk to their agency employees and agency nurseries. Nine units including the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, and the People's Bank of China have harvested more than 138,000 jin of vegetables, supplying the needs of the agency canteens.

### 养猪喂鸡种菜　改善职工生活　培植勤俭风气  中央机关干部动手生产副食品

    养猪喂鸡种菜　改善职工生活　培植勤俭风气
    中央机关干部动手生产副食品
    本报讯　为了改善职工生活，中央国家机关干部在不影响机关工作的情况下，大家动手种植蔬菜和饲养家禽家畜，发展副食品生产。
    中央国家机关从去冬今春开始，在北京郊区建立了蔬菜园、饲料地、养猪场、家禽场和鱼塘等，还修建了许多猪羊圈、鸡鸭舍。全机关的四十五个单位在今年上半年已经种蔬菜一千一百五十多亩，养猪六千多头，养鸡四万六千多只。另外，有些机关还饲养了奶牛、奶羊和养了鱼等。
    各机关的干部对发展副食品生产的热情很高。许多机关除少数行政干部兼任蔬菜园和家禽家畜场的管理人员外，主要依靠干部轮流参加生产劳动。有些机关的办公厅主任、司长带头种菜养猪。不少干部的家属也参加了副食品的生产工作。
    这些机关在发展副食品生产的过程中，培养了管理、饲养家禽家畜的技术人员，组织他们学习饲养和防治家禽、家畜疫病的知识。国务院机关事务管理局6月初开办了猪鸡饲养短期训练班，有中央国家机关四十四个单位的七十多名干部和专职饲养人员参加。石油工业部参加劳动生产的干部，到北京市兽医研究站学习兽医，请老农指导副食品生产。他们饲养的牲畜成活率很高，猪牛没有死亡，近四千只鸡也养得很好，有许多鸡已经开始下蛋。
    解决牲畜饲料是机关发展副食品生产的一个关键问题。各机关除自己种植一些青饲料、杂粮外，还到山地去打猪草、挖野菜和摘树叶。各机关饲养牲畜都以粗饲料为主，精饲料为辅，尽量节约粮食。有些单位争取在今年秋后做到饲料自给。
    中央国家机关发展副食品生产虽然刚开始，不少机关已经收到了效果，改善了机关职工的生活。冶金工业部养了一百多头奶牛，每天出产一千五百多磅牛奶，除了做到机关职工和家属用奶全部自给外，还可抽出一部分供应市场的需要。第一机械工业部和煤炭工业部的牲畜场也开始供应本机关职工和机关托儿所的用奶。铁道部、交通部和中国人民银行九个单位已收获蔬菜十三万八千多斤，供应了机关食堂的需要。
