    Title Concerto – "Butterfly Lovers"
    Li Ling
    It is only natural that people give great love and good evaluation to the "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" (Violin Concerto) created by He Zhanhao and Chen Gang, students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music.
    Using the form of a violin concerto to express a story with a plot is in itself a novel attempt; and this new work also has good achievements in image depiction, weaving, and effect.
    The concerto takes three representative plot segments from the story of "Liang Zhu" as the main content: 1. "Love," 2. "Forced Marriage," 3. "Transformation into Butterflies." The music uses some tunes from the Yue opera as material, and describes the love affair between Liang and Zhu in the form of sonata.
    This new exploration and practice not only allows us to see the continuous emergence of new talents, but also opens up a new field for the creation of national music for symphonies. It tells people that symphonic orchestras or concertos can be used to express rich folk tales and legends in a titular way; it also tells people that not only folk songs and certain folk melodies can be used as materials for symphonies, but also operas, ballads... can also be used as development objects for titular symphonies. This provides a broader world for the nationalization of symphony. In our country's dramas, there are countless very beautiful and moving stories. People are quite familiar with these legends and stories. Using opera music to express some famous themes will be more convenient for audiences who are not very accustomed to symphonies to appreciate and understand.
    Originally, title music is our nation's long-standing tradition (it can also be said to be the most important tradition), such as "Ambush from Ten Sides," "Lament of Zhaojun"... these famous songs all have extremely high attainments. There are various types of title music in our country. Some imitate human singing or bird sounds, such as "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix," "Sounds of Birds in a Secluded Valley," "Song of Joy," and Kazi Opera, etc.; some describe small scenes of life, such as "Hungry Horse Shaking Bells," "Lion Rolling an Embroidered Ball," etc.; some express scenery and emotions, such as "Dragon Boat Race," "Net Fishing," etc.; some only depict the mood of characters, such as "Lament of Zhaojun," etc. Some only embody a certain artistic conception, such as "Spring River Flower Moon Night," etc. In these descriptions, listeners can grasp the author's requirements along the image of the music.
    Various performance techniques and aspects each have their own characteristics. Of course, the most musically infectious are the latter ones.
    The "Butterfly Lovers" concerto, although it selects certain arias from Yue opera as material, is not like Kazi opera, which only plays arias, but uses those fragments of the Yue opera "Butterfly Lovers" that audiences are familiar with and already carry specific emotions due to the wide singing of the "Butterfly Lovers" play as the basis of the artistic conception, and gives rich expression to the violin melody and the concerto of the orchestra. For example, the beautiful scenery at the beginning, Liang and Zhu's love, and the reluctant farewell, Zhu Yuanwai's forced marriage, Zhu Yingtai's sorrow, and the joyful scene of "transformation into butterflies" in the final section are not simply moved over. It uses all the elements of symphony to make a relatively rich depiction, and the violin's expression of the inner contradictions of "Butterfly Lovers" is also relatively outstanding, so it is deeply moving.
    Yes, in some of the musical passages, the orchestra plays more of an accompaniment role, and the concerto flavor is slightly less, but from the perspective of the entire composition, it has a very good effect.
    The author deeply loves Yue opera, so the expression of musical language also has a very strong local flavor, and the soloist Yu Lina has obviously put a lot of effort into expressing such a prominent national color. It is impossible to adopt the usual performance methods to capture the sound and finger movements of such a soft and deeply emotional opera phrase; if a symphony wants to express a strong national style and highlight the sentiment, the most central thing is of course creation, but the role played by the performers in the exploration of this cause is obviously not to be underestimated. It is commendable that teachers at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music can encourage students learning musical instruments to delve into this direction.

    标题协奏曲——“梁祝”
    李凌
    人们对上海音乐院的同学何占豪、陈钢创作的“梁山伯与祝英台”（小提琴协奏曲）给以极大的热爱和较好的评价，这是很自然的。
    用小提琴协奏曲的形式表现一个带有剧情的故事，本身就是一种别开生面的尝试；而这首新作，在形象的刻划、编织、和效果上也有较好的成就。
    协奏曲以“梁祝”故事中较有代表性的三段剧情作为主要内容：一、“相爱”、二、“迫婚”、三、“化蝶”。音乐是采用越剧的部分曲腔作为素材，按照奏鸣曲的形式来描写梁祝相恋的经过。
    这个新的探索和实践，不仅使我们看到了新的人才的不断出现，而且给交响乐的民族音乐创作开辟了一片新的田野。它告诉人们，可以采用交响乐合奏、或协奏的方式，以标题性的方法来表现丰富的民间故事和传说；同时也告诉人们，不仅是民歌、民间的某些旋律可以用作交响乐的素材，就是戏曲、曲艺……也可以当作标题性的交响乐的发展对象。这对于交响乐的民族化，就有更宽的天地了。在我国的戏剧中，拥有无数非常优美动人的故事，人们对这些传说、故事，都相当熟悉，应用戏曲音乐来表现一些有名的题材，对于还不大习惯交响乐的观众的欣赏和领会，就有更多的便利了。
    本来，标题音乐是我们民族悠久的传统（也可以说是最主要的传统），如“十面埋伏”、“昭君怨”……这些名曲，都有极高的造诣。我国的标题音乐多种多样，有的是模仿人声唱腔或鸟声，如“百鸟朝凤”、“空山鸟语”、“欢喜曲”以及卡戏等；有的是描写生活小景，像“饿马摇铃”，“狮子滚绣球”等；有的是表现景趣、情绪，如“赛龙夺锦”、“扑网捕鱼”等；有的只刻划人物的心情，像“昭君怨”等。也有只体现一定的意境，像“春江花月夜”等。这些描绘，听者都可以沿着音乐的形象捉摸到作者的要求。
    各种各样的表现手法和方面，都各有其特点。当然，其中最富音乐感染力的是后面几种。
    “梁祝”协奏曲，虽然是选取越剧的某些唱腔作为素材，但不像卡戏那样，只是吹奏唱腔，而是把观众所熟悉的越剧“梁祝”的那些已经因“梁祝”一剧的广泛传唱，而带有特定情感的片断，作为意境的基础，在小提琴音调上，以及乐队的协奏上给以丰富的表现。像开头的秀丽的景色，梁祝相爱，和依依不舍的别离，祝员外的迫婚，祝英台的哀痛，以及末段“化蝶”的欢乐情景，都不是简单的搬过来。它应用了交响乐的一切因素，做出了比较丰富的描画，小提琴对于“梁祝”的内心矛盾的表现，也比较出色，因此感动人也深。
    是的，其中有些乐段，乐队所起的伴奏作用多些，协奏的意味略嫌少些，而从整个曲作来说，是有很好的效果的。
    作者深爱越剧，因而在音乐语言的表现上，也带有极浓厚的地方色彩，独奏者俞丽拿对表现这样突出的民族色彩，显然花了不少心血。捉摸这样柔美而带有极深情感的戏曲乐句的行音走指，采用通常的演奏方法是不可能的；交响乐要表现浓厚的民族风貌，情调突出，最中心的当然是创作，但是，演奏者在这项事业的探索中所起的作用，显然不能等闲视之。像上海音乐院的教师，能鼓励学习器乐的学生向这个方向去钻研，是值得称颂的。
