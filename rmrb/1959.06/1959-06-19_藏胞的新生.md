    New Life for Tibetan Compatriots

    The newsreels "Special Feature on Tibet" ("News Brief" No. 32), "The New Life of the Khampa People," and "Accusations of the People of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture" are currently showing in the capital.

    "Special Feature on Tibet" introduces some recent developments in Tibet that we are concerned about: a grand gathering of 30,000 people in Lhasa celebrating May Day and the victory of the suppression of the rebellion; Tibetan officials and representatives from all walks of life discussing Nehru's speech; residents moving out of broken tents; a large number of children entering school; and farmers in the Shannan area cultivating their own land with the direct assistance of the People's Liberation Army. The special feature is full of unforgettable scenes. Take "Moving into New Homes" as an example: it first shows us the tattered, quail-like broken tents on the outskirts of Lhasa. Slaves lived under such "roofs" with three generations together. This makes us understand why poor Tibetans would have dogs sleep on them on winter nights; why, in the film, the housewife who moved into a new home hung a portrait of Chairman Mao and presented a Hada before even settling her luggage, and stood there for a long time, silently, as if lamenting and praying.

    "The New Life of the Khampa People" and "Accusations of the People of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture" record the accusations of the Tibetan people in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan against reactionary lamas who were cloaked in religion. Slaves liberated from shackles, carrying tents and food, gathered from areas within hundreds of miles to hold mass rallies to settle accounts with the handful of upper-class reactionaries who had been stepping on their heads, sucking their marrow, and drinking their blood for many years. What we see are flayed human skins, corpses with hearts removed, angry slaves with their eyes gouged out, and various cruel instruments of torture – these are ironclad evidence of the bandits' atrocities of rape, plunder, and all kinds of evil deeds. They lived a lewd and shameless life, extorting all the blood and sweat of the slaves; they hid large amounts of money, treasures, and inexhaustible grain in the temples, while the slaves had no clothes and no food. In the film, we also see evidence of the bandits colluding with foreign and Kuomintang reactionaries to plot rebellion.

    Today, the plague that weighed on the Khampa people has been driven away, and they have begun a new life.

    藏胞的新生
    首都正在上映新闻纪录片“西藏特辑”（“新闻简报”32号）、“康巴的新生”和“甘孜藏族人民的控诉”。
    “西藏特辑”介绍了一些我们关心的西藏近况：拉萨三万群众盛会欢庆五一节和平叛胜利；藏族官员和各界人民代表座谈尼赫鲁的讲话；破帐篷里的居民搬家；大批孩子入学；山南地区的农民在解放军的直接援助下耕种自己的土地。特辑充满令人难忘的景象。随便举“迁入新居”为例吧：它先让我们看到拉萨市郊的百结鹑衣似的破帐篷。奴隶们就在这样的“屋顶”下过着三代同居的生活。这使我们理解了：为什么穷苦的藏民冬夜里要叫狗睡在自己身上；为什么影片中那个搬了家的主妇一进新居，行李还没有安顿好，就先挂毛主席像、献哈达，而且长久地、默默地站在那里，好像哭诉又好像祝祷。
    “康巴的新生”和“甘孜藏族人民的控诉”纪录了四川甘孜藏族自治州一带的藏族人民对披着宗教外衣的反动喇嘛的控诉。从镣铐中解放出来的奴隶，带着帐篷和粮食，从几百里方圆的地区内集中起来，开万人大会清算多少年来踩在他们头上，吸他们的骨髓、喝他们的血的少数上层反动分子。我们看到的剥下的人皮，被挖心的尸体，被挖去眼睛的愤怒的奴隶，以及各种残酷的刑具，这些就是匪徒们奸淫掳掠无恶不作的铁证。他们过着荒淫无耻的生活，搜括尽了奴隶们的血汗；他们在寺庙里藏着大量的金钱财宝和吃不完的粮食，而奴隶们却无衣无食。在影片中，我们还看到了匪徒们勾结外国和国民党反动派阴谋叛乱的罪证。
    今天，压在康巴人身上的瘟神被驱走了，他们开始了新的生活。
