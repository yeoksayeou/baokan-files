Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, June 6th: As the United States intensifies the creation of tension and carries out conspiracies in the Southeast Asian region, especially in Indochina, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) aggression bloc, led by the United States, has held continuous military exercises.

According to an announcement by the British Far East Land Forces Command in Singapore, British infantry and U.S. Marines conducted a joint landing exercise in North Borneo on the 6th. The landing force was commanded by U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Batterton.

It was announced that the British and American troops participating in the exercise are part of the SEATO "Task Force," which will participate in a military exercise codenamed "Upper Saddle" in North Borneo early next week. The U.S. Seventh Fleet will also dispatch aircraft to conduct aerial exercises in the area on June 7.

Prior to this, SEATO held a military exercise involving the air forces and navies of the United States and the Philippines in the Manila Bay area from the 2nd to the 4th.

Meanwhile, according to a Manila report, Brigadier General Thornton of New Zealand, Director of the Military Planning Office of SEATO, said in Manila on the 5th that SEATO may study the issue of organizing a standing army at its future meetings.

He stated that the lack of a standing army does not prevent SEATO from sending troops to "defend" its member states.

    东南亚侵略集团
    连续举行军事演习
    新华社6日讯　新加坡消息：正当美国加紧在东南亚地区特别是在印度支那制造紧张局势、进行阴谋活动的时候，以美国为首的东南亚条约侵略集团连续举行军事演习。
    据在新加坡的英国远东地面部队司令部宣布，英国步兵和美国海军陆战队6日在北婆罗洲举行了联合登陆演习。登陆部队由美国海军陆战队的巴特敦上校指挥。
    据宣布，参加演习的英国和美国军队是东南亚条约组织“特遣部队”的一部分，这支“特遣部队”将于下星期初在北婆罗洲参加代号为“上鞍”的军事演习。美国第七舰队也将派遣飞机，于6月7日在这个地区举行空中演习。
    在这以前，东南亚条约组织在2日到4日在马尼拉海湾地区举行了一次有美国和菲律宾的空军和海军参加的军事演习。
    同时据马尼拉消息，东南亚条约组织军事计划处处长、新西兰的桑顿准将5日在马尼拉说，东南亚条约组织将来可能在它的会议上，研究组织一支常备军的问题。
    他表示，缺乏常备军并不妨碍东南亚条约组织出兵去“保卫”它的成员国。
