    Today's Huaihai
    Visiting the Huaibei Coal Mine
  　By Our Correspondent Yu Ming
    The car traveled the whole day in Xiaoxian and Suixi, but we only saw a small part of the Huaibei Coal Mine. Back at the coal mine preparation office, Deputy Chief Engineer Yu Gongchun spread out a map and told me, "Look, doesn't it look like a fish? The northeast, near Xuzhou, is the fish's tail, and southwest of it, all the way to Suixi City, is like the fish's body and head." I looked closely, and sure enough, the head even had a mouth, and the two pairs of wells in front looked like its eyes.

    I looked at the map carefully, and it evoked an association: Wasn't this the Huaihai Battlefield ten years ago? Within this triangular area were Nianzhuangwei, where our army completely annihilated Huang Botao's corps; Qinglongji in Xiaoxian, where Du Yuming's corps was completely annihilated; and Shuangduiji in Suixi County, where Huang Wei's corps was completely annihilated.

    It turned out that the Huaihai Battlefield of that year was a coal sea. The Huaihai Campaign of ten years ago has now become a battle of a different kind. The biggest enemies faced by the coal well builders are quicksand and groundwater. Fine sand is elusive to everyone, and water flows into every crevice. Overcoming quicksand and groundwater is an arduous battle. As soon as a well is excavated, fine sand and water from all around converge on it. It can't be blasted, it can't be drained, it can't be hardened, it can't be softened. Some well shafts have to pass through tens of meters of quicksand; some wells gush out more than two hundred tons of water per hour; in some wells, the shaft has been dug tens of meters deep, but as soon as it encounters quicksand, the wellhead immediately sinks and the shaft deforms.

    The well-building workers in Yangzhuang spent three days and three nights excavating the No. 3 ventilation shaft. When they dug to eight meters, quicksand and water rushed out together. They immediately busied themselves driving sheet piles and building well rings, struggling back and forth eight or nine times, taking two days and two nights to get through two meters of quicksand. However, when they continued to dig down, the two major enemies attacked again separately. Three water pumps pumped day and night, and after pumping it dry, they dug another two meters. After a while, with a whoosh, it collapsed again. Thus, they dug and collapsed, and collapsed and dug again, for a whole week, and the wellhead collapsed seven times in succession. The workers of the Yuanzhuang mine used the method of digging advanced small wells to lower the water level, and used wooden boards, sacks, and straw bags to block the quicksand around the well wall, cleverly separating the sand and water, and successfully passed through twelve meters of quicksand. The well-building workers in Yuanzhuang and Lieshan also used the "mid-way interception" method, installing water interception boxes or water interception plates to intercept dripping water, reducing the amount of gushing water by half. Despite the difficulties in building the wells, they still defeated the enemy step by step with the spirit of annihilating the Chiang bandits ten years ago. Engineering and technical personnel told me that when necessary, the freezing method would also be used, that is, the water around the well wall would be frozen into an ice wall by means of making ice sticks, and then construction would be carried out.

    The people of a dozen counties in Huaibei are supporting the Huaibei Coal Mine with the same vigor as they supported the Huaihai Campaign. When the reporter arrived, the coal mine had only been under preparation for more than four months, but the railway subgrade for the entire mining area had been built smoothly, and hundreds of kilometers of highways were unobstructed. The Longhe and Daihe rivers in the mining area have been completely rerouted. Many new brick, tile, lime, quarrying, and cement factories have been built around the mining area.

    In a small office, I interviewed Comrade Gao Xintai, director of the coal mine preparation office, who enthusiastically talked about many inspiring things.

    The overall plan for the Huaibei Coal Mine is to open twenty to twenty-five pairs of wells. Designs have been made for more than a dozen pairs of wells. The total design capacity of the entire mine is 12 million tons, and the actual production in the future may reach an annual output of 20 million tons. This year, nine pairs of wells will be built, striving to put a batch of coal wells into production ahead of schedule.

    Yu Gongchun, who was talking to us, was originally an engineer in charge of capital construction in the Huainan Coal Mine. I had interviewed him when I visited the Huainan Coal Mine in 1956. It was he who cleverly improved the construction method and put the two large coal wells in Huainan into production in twenty-four months and twenty-eight months respectively, creating a new record in well-building work, accelerating the speed of well-building by more than twice compared with the general domestic well-building speed at that time. Now we have met again.

    Yu Gongchun said: "Building wells in Huaibei should be based on the foundation of building wells in Huainan, and the speed of putting mines of similar tonnage (900,000 tons) into production should be accelerated by another twofold, putting them into production in one year or a little more."

    Accelerate it by another twofold! I expressed a bit of surprise. He said: "According to the rapid construction methods that have been mastered now, absorbing the experience of the two pairs of wells in Huainan, and cleverly arranging the engineering sequence, it is possible to complete the engineering volume in one year. First of all, adopting large parallel operations and alternating construction can greatly win time."

    He said: "According to the progress of 160 meters of roadway excavation per month last year, the continuous length of general mine roadways in the Huaibei Coal Mine does not exceed 1,200 meters. Excavating simultaneously from the main well and the ventilation well is equivalent to doing 600 meters on one end, which can be completed in four months; the well shaft is 200 meters, which would take four and a half months according to past records; the main well and the auxiliary well will be connected in about one month, and finally the track laying and wiring of the main roadway and the installation and trial operation of mining machinery will take another one or two months. Calculated in this way, as long as the equipment and materials are readily available, a pair of coal wells can be built and put into production within one year."

    I deeply feel that Huaibei is even more lovable. In the past nine years, I have personally seen it transformed from a nationally known disaster area into a prosperous area with crisscrossing river networks and a land of fish and rice. Now, the underground mineral resources have also begun to be developed. According to geological exploration news: from Xuzhou to the south, the Huaibei area along both sides of the Jinpu Railway contains tens of billions of tons of good coal! The Huaibei Coal Mine under construction now is only less than one-tenth of it. How many coal mines will be built to develop all the coal in Huaibei!

    When Su Dongpo was the prefect of Xuzhou, he discovered a small coal area north of Baituzhen in Xiaoxian County, and happily wrote the "Stone Coal" song. He said, "The roots and seedlings sprout boundlessly, ten thousand people drum and dance, a thousand people watch"; he also said, "The chestnut forests in the South Mountain can gradually rest, why bother forging the stubborn ore in the North Mountain, I will cast a hundred-refined knife for you, to chop the long whale into ten thousand pieces." He was simply excited to dance and gesticulate. And what we see now is the abundance of coal in Huaibei, which is truly "roots and seedlings sprout boundlessly"! When we think of the not-too-distant future, when we take the Jinpu train from Xuzhou to enter Huaibei, Anhui, on the land stretching for hundreds of miles, the rice and wheat are abundant, the river networks are crisscrossing, as rich and beautiful as the Jiangnan region, and the mines are standing tall, it is a new coal capital. At that time, not only will ten thousand people be encouraged! The 600 million people across the country will be encouraged by this!

    Huaibei, move forward quickly!

    今日淮海
    访淮北煤矿
  　本报记者　于明
    汽车在萧县和濉溪，整整跑了一天，可是我们却只看到了淮北煤矿的一小部分。回到煤矿筹备处，副总工程师于公纯摊开地图告诉我：“你看，像不像条鱼，东北靠近徐州的是鱼尾，在它的西南，一直到濉溪城，就像是鱼身和鱼头。”我仔细一看，果然，头部还有嘴，而前面两对井，仿佛像它的两只眼睛。
    我仔细地看看地图，引起了我的联想：这不是十年前的淮海战场吗？在这个三角地带之内，有我军全歼黄伯韬的碾庄圩，全歼杜聿明的萧县青龙集，全歼黄维兵团的濉溪县双堆集。
    原来当年的淮海战场是个煤海。十年前的淮海大战，现在变成了另一种性质的战斗。煤井建设者们碰到最大的敌人是流沙和地下水。细沙是谁都难以捉摸的，水流无孔不入，战胜流沙和地下水是一场艰巨的战斗。一个井刚刚开挖，四周老远的细沙和水便都围上来了，炸不动，排不尽，硬不得，软不得。有的一个井筒挖下去，要经过十几公尺厚的流沙；有的井每小时要冒出二百多吨的水；有的井，井筒已打下去几十公尺了，但是一遇上流沙，井口立即下沉，井筒变形。
    杨庄的建井工人花了三天三夜挖开三号风井，当挖到八公尺的时候，流沙和水一起涌出来了，他们马上忙着打板桩，砌井圈，整整来回斗争八九次，费了两天两夜的时间。才通过了二公尺的流沙。然而，当他们继续往下挖的时候，两大敌人便又分头袭来，三个水泵日夜排，排净了，再挖二公尺。一会儿，唿?一声又塌陷了。这样，挖了又坍，坍了再挖，整整一个星期，井口先后塌陷了七次。袁庄矿井的工人们，用挖超前小井的办法，降低水位，并在井壁四周用木板、麻袋、草包等拦住流沙，巧妙地把沙和水分割开来，胜利地通过了十二公尺厚的流沙。袁庄、烈山的建井工人，还用“中途截击”的办法，装截水箱或截水盘截击淋水，使涌水减少了一半。尽管建井是这样的困难，但是他们以十年前歼灭蒋匪的精神，还是一步步地战胜了敌人。工程技术人员对我说，必要时还要用冻结法，就是把井壁周围的水，用制冰棒的办法让它结成冰壁，然后再施工。
    淮北有十几个县的人民，以支援淮海战役的劲头支援着淮北煤矿。当记者到达的时候，煤矿仅仅筹建四个多月，但是全矿区的铁路路基、都已修筑得平平坦坦，成百公里的公路畅通无阻。矿区的龙河、岱河已经完全改道。矿区周围新建了许多砖瓦、石灰、采石、水泥工厂。
    在一间矮小的办公室里，我访问了煤矿筹备处主任高心泰同志，他满怀热忱地谈了许多振奋人心的事。
    淮北煤矿的总体规划，打算开二十到二十五对井。现在有十几对井做出了设计。全矿总设计能力是一千二百万吨，将来实际生产可能达到年产二千万吨。今年建九对井，力争能有一批煤井提前投入生产。
    和我们一起谈话的于公纯，他是原来淮南煤矿基本建设方面的工程师。我在1956年访问淮南煤矿时，曾访问过他。就是他，曾巧妙地改进了施工方法，把淮南的两对大型煤井，分别在二十四个月和二十八个月建成投入了生产，创造了建井工作中的新纪录，比当时国内一般的建井速度，加快达一倍以上。现在我们又碰面了。
    于公纯说：“在淮北建井，要在淮南建井的基础上，把相近吨位（九十万吨）的矿井，再加快一倍，在一年或稍多的时间内投入生产。”
    又加快一倍！我表示有点惊奇。他说：“根据现在已经掌握的快速施工方法，吸收淮南两对井的经验，从工程顺序上巧加安排，一年完成工程量是有可能的。首先采取大的平行作业和交替施工，就可以大大赢得了时间。”
    他说：“根据去年每月巷道掘进一百六十公尺的进度，淮北煤矿一般井巷连续长度不超过一千二百公尺，从大井、风井对头同时掘进，等于一头作六百公尺，有四个月就能完成；井筒二百公尺，按照过去的纪录要四个半月；主井、副井贯穿约一个月，最后大巷的铺轨加线和采掘机械安装、试运转等再一两个月，这样算起来，只要设备器材顺手，是可以在一年内建成一对煤井并投入生产。”
    我深深地感到淮北这块地方更加可爱了。最近九年，我亲眼看到它由全国出名的灾区，变成河网纵横、鱼米之乡的富庶地区。现在，地下的矿藏又开始开发了。据地质勘探消息：从徐州往南，沿津浦路两侧的淮北地区，蕴藏有上百亿吨的好煤！现在建设中的淮北煤矿，只不到它的十分之一罢了。把淮北煤全部开发出来，将要建设多少个煤矿啊！
    苏东坡在徐州作太守时，在萧县白土镇之北发现了一小块煤炭区，便高兴地作了“石炭”歌，他说：“根苗一发浩无际，万人鼓舞千人看”；他又说：“南山栗林渐可息，北山顽矿何劳锻，为君铸作百炼刀，要斩长鲸为万段。”简直兴奋的要手舞足蹈了。而我们现在所看到的淮北煤炭的丰富，才真正是“根苗一发浩无际”哩！当我们想到在不远的将来，从徐州坐津浦车进入安徽淮北，在绵延数百里的土地上，稻麦丰茂，河网纵横，像江南一样的富饶美丽，而矿井林立，却又是一个新的煤都。那时，岂只万人受到鼓舞！全国六亿人民都会为此而鼓舞的！
    淮北，你快快地前进吧！
