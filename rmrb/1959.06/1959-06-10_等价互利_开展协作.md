Equal Value and Mutual Benefit, Develop Cooperation

Xinhua News Agency Report: The production teams of Fumin County, Yunnan Province, have launched cooperation efforts, resulting in faster and better summer harvesting and planting. At the start of the summer harvest and planting season, the Fumin County Party Committee led the masses to reduce non-production personnel in all aspects. Over 90% of the county's rural labor force was投入 into harvesting and planting. Tool reforms and high-efficiency movements were also implemented. However, due to the different seasons for mountainous and plain areas, the varying amounts of harvesting and planting areas, and the varying strengths and amounts of labor and animal power among management districts and production teams, the progress of summer harvesting and planting was very uneven. To resolve this contradiction, the Fumin County Party Committee mobilized the masses to summarize the benefits of past cooperation efforts, commended production teams and members who had done well in cooperation, and sparked a wave of enthusiasm for cooperation throughout the county. After four days and four nights of concentrated effort, all the wheat was harvested, and the planting progress of intermediate rice was more than four times faster than before.

In the cooperation, the people's communes strengthened organization and leadership. There are three main forms of cooperation: First, cooperation between management districts should follow the production season and conduct detailed planning based on actual needs. Second, the management district should rank the situation of each production team on a daily basis and organize cooperation based on the needs of each team. Third, there are different divisions of labor in the cooperation, and various specialized teams are organized according to agricultural work and expertise. In the cooperation, the principle of equal value and mutual benefit was conscientiously implemented through the signing of contracts.

    等价互利　开展协作
    云南富民县各生产队展开协作，夏收夏种又快又好。富民县在夏收夏种开始时，县委领导群众从各方面压缩了非生产人员，全县农村90％以上的劳动力都投入了收、种工作，并且开展了工具改革和高工效运动。但是由于山区、平坝生产节令有早有晚，收和种面积多少不同，又加上各个管理区和生产队劳力、畜力有强有弱，有多有少，因此夏收夏种的进度很不平衡。为了解决这个矛盾，富民县委发动群众总结了过去开展协作的好处，表扬了在协作中搞得好的生产队和社员，全县掀起了协作热潮。经过四天四夜的突击，就把小麦全部收完，中稻栽插进度也比原先提高了四倍以上。
    在协作中，人民公社加强了组织、领导。协作形式主要有三种：一是管理区之间的协作，要服从生产节令，按实际需要进行详细的规划。二、管理区把各个生产队的情况进行逐日排队，根据各队需要组织协作。三、协作中各有分工，按农活和专长组织各种专业队。在协作中，还通过签订合同的方式，认真贯彻了等价互利的原则。
