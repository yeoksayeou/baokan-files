Qingpu Raises Fish Fry and Catches River Delicacies
County's Fish Farming Volume Triples Last Year

(Our newspaper reports) Qingpu County, Shanghai, known as the "Land of Fish and Rice," has witnessed unprecedented development in its fisheries production this year. In the past five months, the county has released over 10 million fish fry into rivers, ponds, and lakes, a three-fold increase compared to last year. These fry will grow into marketable fish within the year. This year, over 50 million "summer flowers" (one-inch fish fry) were also bred and cultivated, equivalent to more than 20 times the total fish fry purchased from other areas by the county from 1955 to 1958. While focusing on large-scale aquaculture development, the county also actively organizes the harvesting of wild river delicacies. In the past six months, the supply of aquatic products such as fish, shrimp, crabs, and shellfish to the city has reached over 4 million jin. In the 14 days of June alone, the supply of yellow eel to the city reached over 90,000 jin, an increase of over 60% compared to the same period last year.

Qingpu County is composed of "three parts land and one part water," with a total of over 360,000 mu of water surface. The eastern part has many rivers, ports, and ditches, while the lakes and marshes in the western part form large areas. These rivers and marshes generally have slow water flow and grow a large amount of aquatic plants, clams, snails, and mussels, providing excellent conditions for the development of aquaculture. After Qingpu County was placed under the leadership of Shanghai Municipality last winter, the Qingpu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the principle of "suburban production serving the city," decided to "focus on both agriculture and sideline occupations." It carefully analyzed the county's favorable conditions for developing aquaculture, fully utilized abundant resources, implemented a "combination of aquaculture and fishing," and rapidly developed the aquatic industry. The county party committee strengthened leadership over fisheries production from top to bottom. The county committee and each commune party committee had a secretary in charge, and the county committee and each commune also established professional organizations. After the Spring Festival this year, Qingpu County also reorganized its specialized aquatic teams: on the one hand, it strengthened the leading backbone of the Jiefang Commune, which specializes in fisheries production; on the other hand, it extracted a group of fishermen from the Jiefang Commune and distributed them to the other fifteen communes. Each commune used them as a basis, deployed some farmers, and established professional aquatic teams.

In developing aquatic production, the Qingpu County Committee first strengthened ideological work, extensively and thoroughly conducted propaganda and education on developing aquaculture, and overcame the "emphasizing agriculture and neglecting aquaculture" ideology and the fear of difficulties among cadres and the masses. After the vast number of cadres and the masses established the view of serving the city, a vigorous upsurge of "everyone taking action, vigorously developing aquatic products" was launched throughout the county, vigorously opening fish ponds, engaging in hatching, and catching river delicacies. The responsible cadres of the county committee also personally presided over carp hatching, opening up fish ponds, and personally helped the grassroots to create a model that combines professional fishing and amateur fishing. These measures ensured the simultaneous development of agriculture and fisheries.

Recently, the county committee also summarized the experience of last year's experiments in rice-fish culture, affirming that raising carp and crucian carp in rice fields can not only increase fish production but also benefit rice growth, and should be actively promoted. At present, the aquaculture work of various communes has been combined with the summer planting activities. According to incomplete statistics from Chonggu, Zhaoxiang, Chengxiang, Liantang, Zhiyuan, and other communes, over 5 million carp have been raised in about 2,500 mu of rice fields, water chestnut fields, and caltrop fields. Other communes are also preparing, and it is expected that about 10,000 mu will be stocked throughout the county, with an estimated yield of about 100 jin of fish per mu by the end of the year.

### 青浦饲养鱼苗捕捞河鲜  全县养鱼量比去年增加三倍

    青浦饲养鱼苗捕捞河鲜
    全县养鱼量比去年增加三倍
    本报讯　素有“鱼米之乡”之称的上海市青浦县，今年渔业生产空前发展。五个多月来，全县已放养河塘湖荡鱼种一千多万尾，比去年增长三倍。这些鱼种在年内可以育成能上市的大鱼。这里今年还繁殖培育了五千多万尾“夏花”（一寸左右的鱼苗），相当于全县1955年到1958年间向外地采购的鱼苗总和的二十多倍。这个县在抓养殖大发展的同时，还积极组织捕捞野生河鲜，近半年来，供应城市的鱼、虾、蟹和贝类等水产品共达四百多万斤。在6月份的十四天内，单是供应城市的黄鳝就有九万多斤，比去年同期增长60％以上。
    青浦县全境“三分陆地一分水”，共有三十六万多亩水面。东部有很多的河港、沟渠，西部的湖泊?荡联成大片。这些河荡一般水流不急，生长着大量的水草和蚬、蛤、螺蛳，对发展养殖业条件很好。去年冬季，青浦县划归上海市领导以后，中共青浦县委根据“郊区生产要为城市服务”的方针，决定“一手抓农业，一手抓副业”，认真分析了全县发展养殖业的有利条件，充分利用了丰富资源，实行“养殖捕捞并举”，高速度地发展水产事业。这县的党委自上而下的加强了对渔业生产的领导，县委、各公社党委都有一个书记挂帅，县委会和各公社并且成立了专业机构。今年春节后，青浦县还改组了水产专业队伍：一方面充实了专业渔业生产的解放公社的领导骨干，另一方面从解放公社中抽出了一批渔民，分给其他十五个公社，各公社以他们为基础，调配了部分农民，建立了专业的水产队伍。
    在发展水产生产中，青浦县委首先加强了思想工作，广泛深入地进行了发展水产的宣传教育，克服了干部和群众中“重农业轻水产”的思想和畏难情绪。广大干部和群众树立了为城市服务的观点以后，全县范围内就开展了一个声势浩大的“大家动手，大搞水产”的高潮，大力开鱼塘，搞孵化，捉河鲜。这里的县委负责干部，还亲自主持了鲤鱼孵化、开辟鱼塘，亲自帮助基层做出专业捕捞和业余捕捞相结合的样子。通过这些措施就保证了农业和渔业同时大发展。
    最近县委还总结了去年试验的在稻田养鱼的经验，肯定在稻田养鲤鱼、鲫鱼，既可增加鱼的产量，又有利于稻子生长，应当积极推广。目前各公社的养殖工作已结合夏种行动起来。据重固、赵巷、城厢、练塘、芷院等公社的不完整统计，已在二千五百亩左右的稻田、茭白田、菱田里养了五百多万尾鲤鱼。其他公社也在准备，预计全县可放养一万亩左右，到年底，每亩可产鱼百斤左右。
