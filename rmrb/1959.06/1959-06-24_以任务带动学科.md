    In science and technology, we are still behind and must work harder. Tasks that directly serve production and construction should be given top priority. On all fronts of production and construction, there are thousands of technical problems, and scientific and technical workers should divide their labor and cooperate to solve these problems. Cutting-edge science and technology must also be developed; for those conditions that are not yet in place, we should prepare conditions from all aspects. Basic theoretical research has a profound impact on the development of science and technology and must be given sufficient attention.
    ——Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress

    Using Tasks to Drive Disciplines
    Bian Boming, Deputy Director of the Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Disciplines are not easily developed by simply pursuing the goal of developing disciplines and doing topics that are divorced from reality.

    Integrating theory with practice and having scientific research serve production is the Party’s basic policy for scientific research; only by adhering to this policy can we contribute to socialist production and construction. In the past, some people believed that integrating theory with practice was not a problem for natural scientists. Because they are pragmatic, do not engage in empty speculation, but constantly repeat experiments and summarize scientific theories based on experimental data, which is the so-called practice (experiment) producing theory, it is already connected with reality. However, this alone does not explain the problem of integrating theory with practice. As for how to conduct research based on known theories, combined with the actual situation, and according to the needs of socialist production and construction, they are unwilling to consider it and reluctant to undertake this task, believing that it is a matter for engineering and technical personnel.

    Some scientific workers have held a fixed view for many years, believing that scientific research is about theoretical work. This understanding cannot be said to be wrong, but it is inappropriate to regard theoretical work as the only thing. Moreover, so-called theoretical work does not necessarily connect with reality and cannot undertake tasks. Scientific workers can choose topics at will according to their interests, or pick up so-called internationally advanced cold bones from foreign magazines. Work with unclear purpose is generally called "theoretical research." At the same time, they despise connecting with reality, believing that this kind of work cannot improve scientific standards and has nothing to study. They also despise simulation work, believing that it is not invention and creation and cannot develop theory. In their work, they believe that they cannot bring many young researchers, only three or four people are enough. As a result, a few people have been experimenting and studying in their own small world for a long time, some for seven or eight years, or even more than ten years, still working hard on a small point, and the field of knowledge becomes very narrow. They are diligent and hardworking, but their achievements are not many, and they are outside the booming and earth-shattering socialist construction. Because there is no clear purpose, young people follow them for a long time, their work enthusiasm is not high, and the progress is very slow. This shows that the road of purely pursuing theory for theory's sake and conducting research to develop disciplines is impassable. Because there is no realistic foundation, research topics with flesh and blood cannot be produced. Some topics are completed but it is not known what they are for. Some add a brick or half a tile and blindly work for others. Some topics are just published and that's it, regardless of whether they are useful or not. The result of this kind of research cannot be said to contribute to the people, cannot successfully train a group of talented scientific cadres, and cannot develop disciplines according to their own wishes. Therefore, disciplines are not easily developed by simply pursuing the goal of developing disciplines and doing topics that are divorced from reality.

    How can scientific workers correctly understand and approach tasks?

    In the past, scientific workers' understanding and attitude towards tasks were extremely inconsistent. Some people believe that since it is a task, it is to solve practical problems, and the research must be comprehensive. Most of the work done by scientific workers is single-factor research, but practical problems are not single-factor, which makes scientific workers feel embarrassed and distressed, and it is not easy to solve problems, because some of the problems are not within the scope of their research. There are many people who hold this view, which also shows some of the real situation. However, this is a question of how to organize and lead experts and experts, experts and the masses, and division of labor and cooperation between departments. This can be solved, and some have already been solved. Some people believe that tasks are assigned by superiors, they are national tasks. If you undertake a task, the pressure is high, the urging is tight, you are mentally stressed, you cannot quietly consider problems, you cannot do systematic research, and you cannot develop disciplines. Undertaking tasks has a certain amount of pressure, and being free and unrestrained is restricted to a certain extent; however, we must also see that our work cannot be just relaxing and not tense, we cannot let the horse run wild. Undertaking tasks can concentrate manpower and energy, and promote brainstorming, considering problems, and solving problems, thereby developing disciplines. Some people also believe that tasks can be assigned by superiors, or they can be proposed by themselves. This depends on their level of awareness, their sense of responsibility to the country and the people, their sincere love for socialism, and their standpoints, viewpoints, and political level. Some people say that tasks are proposed by the times, not assigned by anyone. We want to catch up with the world's advanced level in a relatively short period of time from a country with backward production and underdeveloped industry. If our scientific research cannot play a leading role, cannot contribute, and cannot keep up, it is obviously not possible. The rapid development of various sciences and the leaps and bounds of various undertakings, where one day is equal to twenty years, make it objectively impossible for a certain discipline to advance in a corresponding manner. So, do we actively keep up, or do we wait? Of course, the development of things always has a sequence, speed, catching up with each other, interlacing, a certain distance, and a certain proportion. However, too long a distance and long-term backwardness are objectively not allowed to exist. This is the task of the times, the objective requirement, the people's wish, and the question of how scientific workers actively choose.

    Disciplines are divided according to a certain meaning of commonality, but in another sense, each has its own characteristics.

    The statements about disciplines are also very different, each emphasizing one aspect. Topics that people are willing to study are one statement, and topics that they are unwilling to study are another statement. When they are unwilling, the change of topics can also be said to be a change of profession, circling around in nouns. From the perspective of major disciplines, the division of disciplines is originally relatively standardized. The criteria for dividing small disciplines in major disciplines are very inconsistent. For example, in chemistry, divided by industry, there are heavy organic chemistry, light organic chemistry, etc.; divided by molecular structure, there are polymer chemistry, steroid chemistry, carbohydrate chemistry, etc.; divided by application, there are medicinal chemistry, food chemistry, fragrance chemistry, etc.; divided by component elements, there are silicate chemistry, fluorine chemistry, boron chemistry, etc.; divided by performance, there are radiation chemistry, electrochemistry, magnetic chemistry, etc. In short, disciplines are divided according to a certain meaning of commonality, but in another sense, each has its own characteristics. There is a connection between commonality and characteristics, and they can be transformed. For chemists, the main task is to find the internal connections and internal laws between substances, and then follow their laws, according to human requirements, to decompose, combine, transform them to serve people. Now, chemistry is used extremely widely, and the need is extremely urgent. Chemical problems are involved everywhere. It is an era for chemists to show their talents and make great achievements.

    How to choose significant topics for research is the responsibility of scientists and a measure of scientific standards.

    Everything is constantly developing and changing. Chemists understand this truth very well, because they often come into contact with and observe this change and development. However, when choosing topics, how to grasp new things, new growth points, and grasp the key and primary problems in the change and development, some people are at a loss. Some people even cling to the old and do not want to adopt new methods and new technologies, believing that it is not a formal research method. It should be recognized that objective existence is constantly developing, and science itself is also constantly developing, critical, and anti-conservative. How to attach importance to newly developed things, new disciplines, new research methods, and new technologies, promote the continuous development of science, and thereby promote the continuous progress of socialist undertakings, is also the task of scientists.

    In the macro world and in the micro world, there are countless things and endless problems. Our knowledge of them is pitifully small, and we should seek more knowledge. However, in the realm of countless sands in the Ganges and vast as the sea, how to choose significant topics for research is the responsibility of scientific workers and a measure of scientific standards. Picking up a handful of weeds at random and seeking all knowledge about it can also be studied for a lifetime, but that is probably not very meaningful. The selection of scientific research topics is very important, and the selection of topics is not easy. The purpose of the topic and the source of the topic are all worth noting. In the past, many researchers did not pay attention to this aspect.

    Using tasks to drive disciplines is to develop disciplines and improve disciplines through tasks.

    During the Great Leap Forward last year, based on the above situation, the scientific community proposed the issue of using tasks to drive disciplines. Using tasks to drive disciplines is to fill in the blank spots in disciplines through tasks, and to develop and improve disciplines through tasks. Using tasks to drive disciplines is purposeful. It is to develop disciplines in the service of production, which is the concretization of integrating theory with practice. Integrating theory with practice includes two meanings: using theory as guidance to solve practical problems, and developing theory from solving practical problems. Moreover, this theoretical guidance must be combined with the specific conditions of the research object to be different, otherwise the theory will not work. There are no completely identical things in the world, and scientific theories have certain limitations. Therefore, to truly solve practical problems, we must not ignore the basis of existing theories, nor can we be completely bound by existing theories. We should develop them in the face of different things. Using tasks to drive disciplines is also this meaning.

    The research on steroid chemistry, polytetrafluoroethylene, etc. has proved that the effect of using tasks to drive disciplines is very good.

    Now, let's look at the effects of using tasks to drive disciplines from the perspective of organic chemistry research.

    The history of Steroid Chemistry has been around for decades, and its association with animal hormones has attracted people's attention. Some hormones (drugs) with special effects on physiological dysfunctions (such as nephritis, arthritis, etc.) are mainly steroid compounds. Before liberation, steroid chemistry was basically a blank spot in our country. After liberation, organic chemists began to study it in 1952, but only a few people were doing it. In 1958, under the amazing Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, under the call of using tasks to drive disciplines, the research work on steroid chemistry had a great leap forward. Steroid hormones were originally a class of precious chemicals with complex preparation techniques and long operation processes. The industrial sector originally included them in the third five-year plan for production. Under the shock of the Great Leap Forward, the industrial sector wanted to produce them as soon as possible, hoping that organic chemists would combine with reality to serve the Great Leap Forward in production. Under the situation of mutual promotion, under the close combination of experts and the masses, ten hormones such as "Cortisone" were synthesized last year, providing the chemical industry sector with item-by-item preparation conditions for trial production. Organic chemists previously felt that there were not many topics to study in this area, so they were unwilling to do it, and they also believed that it was impossible to bring many young researchers. Unexpectedly, since cooperating with the industrial sector, they felt that there were more and more research topics and the scope of research was getting wider and wider. Because the actual situation has raised many new issues that should be studied and solved, the scientists and other researchers engaged in this work have deeply realized the importance of integrating theory with practice, and deeply believe that only by connecting with reality can they enrich their knowledge and discover problems.

    Before cooperating with the industrial sector, scientific researchers never thought that the preparation of "Cortisone" could be completed in seven steps. After undertaking the task, they began to compare all the synthesis methods, technical routes, and economic, safety, and time advantages and disadvantages of synthesizing "Cortisone" and other hormones. When checking the literature, they began to pay close attention and began to consider the actual situation of domestic raw materials and chemical drugs, thereby designing and adopting domestic steroid sapogenin as raw material, and finally synthesizing "Cortisone" through seven steps of reaction. This is the result of research work combining with reality. In the seven-step synthesis route of "Cortisone", the yield of the last step was initially only 32% of the theoretical value. In research that is not combined with production, most people do not delve into this issue and do not know its importance. However, combined with reality, it is noted that if the yield of the last step can be increased, it will have great economic value. Of course, to increase its yield, we must investigate its reaction mechanism. After a period of research, it was increased to 60% of the theoretical yield, almost doubling compared to before. In addition, in the synthesis of "Cortisone", several reagents used in an oxidation reaction in the middle step were too uneconomical for mass production, and the supply of one of the reagents was also difficult. To solve this production problem, we must research cheap and easily available oxidizing agents and appropriate reaction conditions. So we tried other oxidation methods, and the results were extremely satisfactory. And therefore, it was further conceived that if this oxidation method was also used when synthesizing the hormone "Cortisol", which has a greater therapeutic effect than "Cortisone", the synthesis route could be shortened by three steps compared to the original. Experiments have proved that this is indeed the case, and the yield is higher than the methods known in foreign literature. If the laboratory results are extended to industry, the operation process can be simplified and the cost can be greatly reduced. These are all examples of theory connecting with practice and practice promoting theory.

    For another example, polytetrafluoroethylene is an extremely important plastic with special properties and great uses. The world calls it the "King of Plastics". The production technology is complex, and all countries list it as a top-secret product, but China also needs it extremely. The industrial sector, universities, and the chemical research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly undertook the task of solving this problem, organized cooperation, and worked together. From research and trial production to intermediate production, they finally achieved success. Related units further developed various research and preparation of organic fluorine. In the past, the foundation of fluorine research was extremely weak. By completing the task, it also promoted the development of various organic fluorine chemistry.

    Using tasks to drive disciplines can conduct systematic research, it is just a matter of how the tasks are proposed and arranged.

    When scientific research is not combined with reality and does not undertake tasks, most of the problems studied are in small corners and theoretical problems that are irrelevant to the overall situation. Because they are divorced from reality and do not understand the actual situation in technology and theory, even if they read literature, they do not pay attention because it is not closely related to their work. Therefore, their knowledge in disciplines is also limited. After participating in production cooperation, the situation has changed greatly. Because they understand some of the real situation, the scope of research that must be done is getting wider and wider; in order to complete the task, they must change the cold and deserted situation in the past, and must rely on the masses and concentrate the wisdom of the masses to solve the problem together. Not only in experiments, but also in theory, we must follow the mass line, and literature searches are also divided and cooperated, and then each tells what they know. Because it is collective work, and everyone is working towards one goal, everyone automatically pays more attention to working hours, experimental yield, and theoretical discussion than before, and work and study have made unprecedented leaps. And because they have recognized many difficulties in experiments, the demand for theoretical knowledge is even more urgent, and the atmosphere of studying literature and researching theoretical problems has also been greatly developed. This also shows the importance of theory, and the research of theory cannot be ignored.

    Of course, the Academy of Sciences should attach importance to systematic research work. Some people believe that using tasks to drive disciplines cannot do systematic research. From the research on steroid chemistry, organic fluorine, etc., it shows that using tasks to drive disciplines can conduct systematic research, it is just a matter of how the tasks are proposed and arranged. The development between disciplines also promotes each other. Sometimes, one discipline promotes the development of another discipline, takes a step first, and then obtains application. Sometimes, if one discipline does not develop, it is impossible for the other discipline to develop. This is the connection of things. Although there are also disciplines that cannot be driven by tasks, that is always a minority, and can be discussed separately. It should be admitted that any discipline is not conceived out of thin air, but is produced in practice. This is the reflection theory of epistemology. It's just that it is not necessarily combined with tasks. The reflection of things, in the stage of summarizing, generalizing, and abstracting into theory, may not be immediately applicable and return to practice. But this kind of theoretical research is still very necessary. We cannot take it lightly just because it cannot be combined with reality at the time. This is not mutually exclusive with integrating theory with practice, but a unity of opposites.

    Because the research work is connected with reality, and the hard work of scientific workers has contributed to the motherland and the people, it has been valued by the country and supported by the people. After the practice of the Great Leap Forward since last year, the old scientists have seen the achievements they have made, and their understanding has undergone great changes and improvements. Therefore, they feel comfortable and happy, and the young researchers are also excited and strengthened their confidence. In the future, we must continue to move forward along this road, work hard, and continue to climb the peaks of science.

    在科学技术上，我们现在还是落后的，必须加紧努力。直接为生产建设服务的任务，应当放在首要的地位。在生产建设的各个战线上，存在着千千万万的技术课题，科学技术工作者应当分工协作，为解决这些课题而努力。尖端科学技术也必须注意发展；对于条件还不具备的，目前应当从各方面准备条件。基础理论的研究，对于科学技术的发展具有深远的影响，必须给以足够的重视。
    ——周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的“政府工作报告”
    以任务带动学科
    中国科学院有机化学研究所副所长　边伯明
    单纯抱了发展学科的目的而做脱离实际的题目，学科是不容易发展起来的。
    理论联系实际，科学研究为生产服务，是党对科学研究的基本方针；只有坚持这一方针，才能对社会主义的生产建设有所贡献。过去有些人认为，理论联系实际对自然科学家来说是没有问题的。因为他们实事求是，不凭空想臆断，而是不断反复实验，依照实验的数据总结出科学理论，正是所谓实践（实验）出理论，已经联系实际了。但是，仅此并没有说明理论联系实际的问题。至于如何根据已知的理论，结合实际情况，按照社会主义生产建设的需要进行研究，则不愿加以考虑，不乐意承担这种任务，认为那是工程技术人员的事。
    有的科学工作者多年来有一个固定的观点，认为科学研究是搞理论工作的。这种认识不能说不对，但是把搞理论认为是唯一的，则不妥当。而且，所谓理论工作不一定联系实际，不能承担任务，由科学工作者自己随心所欲，根据兴趣选择题目，或在外国杂志上拣所谓国际水平的冷骨头。把目的性不明确的工作，总而言之叫“理论研究”。同时轻视联系实际，认为这种工作不能提高科学水平，没有什么可研究的。还轻视模拟性的工作，认为那不是发明创造，不能发展理论。在工作中，则认为不能多带青年研究人员，只有三、四人还可以。以致少数人长期地在自己的小天地中实验、钻研，有的七、八年，十几年过去了，仍然只在一小点上下功夫，知识领域变得很狭窄。孜孜不倦，用心良苦，只是成就不多，置身于轰轰烈烈、天翻地复的社会主义大建设之外。由于没有明确的目的性，以致青年人长期跟着走下去，工作情绪不高，进展速度非常慢。这说明仅仅为理论而理论，为发展学科而研究的路是走不通的。因为没有现实基础，产生不出有血有肉的研究题目。有的题目作成了也不知道有什么用场。有的凑一砖半瓦，糊里糊涂为人作嫁。有的题目只是发表了文章也就算了，不管它有无作用。这样研究的结果说不上对人民有贡献，不能成功地培养出一批有才能的科学干部来，也不能按照自己的愿望发展学科。所以，单纯抱了发展学科的目的而做脱离实际的题目，学科是不容易发展起来的。
    科学工作者对任务的理解和态度，怎样才能正确。
    过去，科学工作者对任务的理解和态度是极不一致的。有人认为，既是任务，就是解决实际问题，要研究的必然是综合性的。科学工作者们从事的多数是单因素的研究，实际问题则不会是单因素的，这样会使科学工作者感到为难苦恼，也不容易解决问题，因为其中有的问题不属于他所研究的范围。抱有这种认识的人是不少的，也说明了部分的真实情况。不过，这是一个如何组织领导专家与专家、专家与群众、部门与部门之间分工协作的问题。这是可以解决的，而且有的已经解决了。有人认为，任务是上面交下来的，是国家任务。如果承担任务，压力大，催的紧，精神紧张，不能安静地考虑问题，不能作系统的研究，也不能发展学科。承担任务是有一定压力的，自在消遥、随心所欲是受了一定制约的；但是，也要看到，我们的工作不能光弛而不张，不能信马由缰。承担任务，可以更集中人力、集中精力，促使开动脑筋，考虑问题，解决问题，从而发展学科。也有人认为，任务可以由上边交下来，也可以自己提出。这就要看自己的觉悟程度如何，看对国家对人民的责任感如何，看对社会主义是否真诚热爱，也看自己的立场观点和政治水平。有的人说，任务是时代提出的，不是任何人交给的。我们要从一个生产落后、工业不发达的国家，在比较短的时间内赶上世界先进水平，如果我们的科学研究不能起到领先的作用，不能有所贡献，也不能跟上去，显然是不行的。各种科学神速的发展，各种事业一天等于二十年地跃进，某一学科不能相适应地前进，是客观不允许的。那么，我们是主动地跟上去呢，还是等待呢？当然，事物的发展总是有先有后，有快有慢，此追彼赶，错综交插，有一定距离，成一定比例的。但是，过远的距离，长期的落后，客观上是不容许存在的。这就是时代的任务，客观的要求，人民的愿望，是科学工作者如何主动选择的问题。
    学科是按某种意义的共性划分的，而在另一种意义上又各有它的特性。
    对于学科的说法也极不相同，各自强调一方面。乐意研究的题目是一个说法，不乐意研究的又是个说法。不乐意的时候，题目的更改也能说是改行，在名词上兜圈子，打转转。从大学科讲，学科的划分本来是比较有准则的。大学科中的小学科划分的标准，就很不一致了。如化学，按工业划分，则有重有机化学、轻有机化学等；按分子结构划分，则有高分子化学、甾体化学、碳水化合物化学等；按用途划分，则有药物化学、食品化学、香料化学等；按成分原素划分，就分为硅酸盐化学、氟化学、硼化学等；按性能划分，就分为辐射化学、电化学、磁化学等。总之，学科都是按某种意义的共性划分的，而在另一种意义上又各有它的特性。共性与特性之间是有联系的，是可以转化的。对化学家来说，主要任务在于寻找物质之间内在的联系，内在的规律，然后顺其规律，按照人的要求，使其分解、化合，互相转化而为人服务。现在，化学的用途极广，需要极为迫切，无处不牵涉到化学问题，正是化学家大施本领，大有可为的时代。
    如何选择意义重大的题目进行研究，是科学家的责任，也是科学水平的测定仪。
    无论甚么事物，都在时刻地发展变化中。化学家很懂得这一真理，这是因为他们经常接触、观察这种变化和发展。但是对于选择题目的时候，如何抓新东西，新的生长点，抓变化发展中的关键性的首要的问题，有人则茫然不知所措。甚至有人抱残守缺，连新方法、新技术都不想采用，认为那不是正规的研究方法。应该认识到客观存在是不断发展的，科学本身也是不断发展的、批判的、反保守的。如何重视新发展起来的东西，新学科，新的研究方法，新技术，促进科学不断发展，从而促进社会主义事业不断前进，也是科学家的任务。
    在宏观世界，在微观世界，都有无数量的东西，有无穷尽的问题，我们对它们的知识少得可怜，是应该多多求知的。但是在恒河沙数、浩如烟海的境界中，如何选择意义重大的题目进行研究，是科学工作者的责任，也是科学水平的测定仪。随手拈来一把草芥，求得对它的全部知识，也可以研究一生，那就恐怕是意义不大的。科学研究的选题很重要，选题也不容易。题目的目的性，题目的来源都值得注意，过去有不少研究人员对这方面是不重视的。
    以任务带动学科是通过任务，发展学科、提高学科。
    在去年大跃进的时候，根据以上情况，科学界提出了以任务带动学科的问题。以任务带动学科是通过任务把学科中的空白点补起来，并通过任务使学科得到发展，得到提高。以任务带动学科是有的放矢，是要在为生产服务中发展学科，也就是理论联系实际的具体化理论联系实际包括两种意义，用理论作指导解决实际问题，又从解决实际问题中发展理论。而且，这种理论指导必须结合研究对象的具体条件而有所不同，否则，理论也就不起作用。世界上没有任何完全相同的事物，科学理论也有一定的局限性。所以，真正解决实际问题则既不能忽视现有理论的根据，也不能被现有的理论完全束缚住，而应当在不同事物面前有所发展。以任务带动学科也正是这种意思。
    甾体化学、聚四氟乙烯等的研究都证明，以任务带动学科的效果很好。
    现在从有机化学研究方面的事例来看以任务带动学科的效果。
    甾体化学（Steroid　Chemistry）的历史已经有几十年了，它和动物激素的关联受到人们的重视。一些对生理机能性病症（如肾脏炎、关节炎等等）具有特效的激素（药物）其中主要的就是甾体化合物。解放以前，甾体化学在我国基本上是个空白点。解放以后，1952年有机化学家才开始研究，但是也只有少数几个人在做。1958年在工农业惊人的大跃进下，在以任务带动学科的号召下，甾体化学的研究工作才有了个大跃进。甾体激素本是一类制备技术复杂、操作流程较长的贵重化学品，工业部门本来把它列入第三个五年计划内生产。在大跃进的浪涛震动下，工业部门要早日生产，希望有机化学家结合实际为生产大跃进服务。在互相促进的形势下，在专家和群众亲密的结合下，去年合成了“可的松”等十种激素，提供化工部门逐项准备条件，投入试制生产。有机化学家以前觉得，在这方面可以研究的题目不多，所以不愿意搞，也认为不可能多带青年研究人员。不料，自从和工业部门协作以后，感到研究题目愈来愈多，能研究的范围也愈来愈广。因为，实际情况提出了许多应该研究的新问题要求加以解决，使从事这项工作的科学家和其他研究人员，深刻地体会到理论联系实际的重要性，深信只有联系实际才能更丰富知识，发现问题。
    在和工业部门协作以前，科学研究人员完全没有想到“可的松”的制备可以七步完成。在担当了任务以后，才开始比较所有合成“可的松”和其他激素的合成方法、技术路线和在经济上、安全上、时间上的优缺点。在查文献的时候，才开始深刻地加以注意，也才开始考虑到国内在原料上、化学药品上的实际情况，从而设计采用国产甾体皂素作原料，最后经七步反应合成了“可的松”。这是研究工作结合实际才能产生的结果。在七步合成“可的松”的路线中，最后一步的获得率最初只到理论数值的32％，在不结合生产的研究上，大都不深究这个问题，也不知道它的重要。但是结合了实际就注意到如果能增加最后一步的获得率，就有极大的经济价值。当然要增加它的获得率，就得追究它的反应机理。经过一定时间的研究，增加到了理论获得率的60％，比较以前几乎提高一倍。另外，在合成“可的松”的时候，中间有一步氧化反应需要用的几种试剂在大量生产上太不经济，而且其中一种试剂的供应还有困难。要解决生产上的这个问题，必须研究出廉价而且容易得到的氧化剂和适当的反应条件。于是试用了另外的氧化方法，结果极为令人满意。并因此进一步设想到，如果在合成疗效比“可的松”更大的激素“可的唑”的时候，也采用这一氧化方法，则合成路线可以比原来缩短三步。实验证明，果然这样，而且获得率比外国文献上已知的方法为高。如果把实验室成果推广到工业上去，则可以简化操作流程，大大降低成本。这都是理论联系实际，实践促进理论的例证。
    又如，聚四氟乙烯是极为重要的塑料，有特殊性能，用途极大，世人称它是“塑料王”。生产技术复杂，各国都列为绝密产品，但是中国又极为需要。工业部门、高等学校和中国科学院化学研究单位，共同承担解决这个问题的任务，组织了协作，齐心协力，从研究试制到中间生产，终于都获得成功。有关单位进而发展了有机氟的各种研究制备。关于氟的研究工作，过去的基础极为薄弱，通过完成任务，也促进了各种有机氟化学的发展。
    以任务带动学科是能够进行系统研究的，只是任务如何提出和如何安排的问题。
    科学研究不结合实际，不承担任务的时候，所研究的问题多数是在细小的角落里和无关大体的理论问题。因为脱离实际，不了解技术和理论方面的实际情况，就是阅读文献，因为和工作关系不密切，也不专心注意，因而在学科上的知识也是有限的。在参加生产协作以后，情况大为改变，因为了解了若干真情实况，必须研究的范围愈来愈广；为了完成任务，必须改变过去那种冷冷清清的局面，必须依靠群众，集中群众的智慧共同解决问题。不但在实验上，就是在理论上也必须走群众路线，查阅文献也是分工合作，然后互告所知。因为是集体工作，为一个目标而努力，大家自动地在工作时间上、实验的获得率上，理论的探讨上都远较从前认真注意，工作、学习都得到了空前的跃进。并且因为在实验上认识了许多困难，所以，对理论知识的要求也更为迫切，学习文献、互相研究理论问题的风气也大为开展。这也说明理论的重要，理论的研究不容忽视。
    当然，在科学院应当重视有系统的研究工作。有人认为，以任务带动学科不能作系统的研究。从甾体化学、有机氟等的研究中说明，以任务带动学科是能够进行系统研究的，只是任务如何提出和如何安排的问题。学科之间的发展也是互相促进的。有时，某一学科促进了另一学科的发展，先走一步，然后再获得应用。有时，彼一学科不发展，此一学科想发展也不可能。这是事物的联系性。虽然也有任务不能带动的学科，但那总是少数，可当别论。应当承认，任何学科不是凭空想出来的，都是在实际中产生的，这是认识论的反映论。只是不一定结合着任务。事物的反映，在总结、概括、抽象为理论的阶段中，不一定即刻能够应用，回到实际中去。但是这种理论的研究还是很必需的。不能因为当时不能结合实际，就等闲视之。这和理论联系实际不相排斥，而是矛盾的统一。
    由于研究工作联系了实际，科学工作者的辛勤劳动，对祖国对人民作出了贡献，因而得到了国家的重视和人民的支持。经过去年以来大跃进的实践，老科学家看到了获得的成就，认识上有了很大的转变和提高。因而心情舒畅，精神愉快，年轻的研究人员也都为之振奋，增强了信心，今后，我们仍然要顺着这条道路前进，艰苦奋斗，继续攀登科学的高峰。
