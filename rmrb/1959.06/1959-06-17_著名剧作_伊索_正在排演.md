    Famous Play "Aesop" is in Rehearsal
    The Beijing People's Art Theatre is rehearsing the play "Aesop" by the contemporary Brazilian playwright Guilherme Figueiredo, preparing to stage it in early July.
    "Aesop's Fables" is a world-renowned classic literary work widely loved by Chinese readers. There is no definitive historical research on Aesop's life. Playwright Guilherme Figueiredo, based on the legendary stories of Aesop's life, wrote a play with new ideological content: "Aesop."
    Just like the meaningful "Aesop's Fables," the historical play "Aesop" contains profound realistic significance. The author, through the story of the slave fabulist who would rather die for freedom than live as a slave, reflects the current fighting will of the Latin American people to fight for freedom and liberation. Through the depiction of hypocritical, greedy, despicable, and cruel slave owners, it exposes the ugly faces of today's colonialists. The script won a prize from the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Government. The play has been performed with great success in Brazil, Latin America, the Soviet Union, Greece, and Vienna. "Aesop" is the first Latin American play to be staged in China. Chen Yong is the director, and the cast includes Lü Qi, Shu Xiuwen, Fang Guande, Lü En, Yang Wei, Ping Yuan, and Liu Qin.

### 著名剧作“伊索”正在排演

    著名剧作“伊索”正在排演
    北京人民艺术剧院正在排演巴西当代名剧作家吉里耶尔美·菲格莱德的剧作“伊索”，准备在7月初上演。
    “伊索寓言”是我国读者普遍喜爱的一部世界古典文学名著。关于伊索的生平，已无确实考证。剧作家吉里耶尔美·菲格莱德，根据传说中伊索的生活故事进行加工，写出了具有崭新思想内容的话剧：“伊索”。
    正像寓意深刻的“伊索寓言”一样，“伊索”这出历史题材的话剧孕含着深刻的现实意义。作家借奴隶寓言家宁为自由而死，不作奴隶而生的斗争事迹，反映出当前拉丁美洲人民争取自由解放的战斗意志；通过对伪善、贪婪、卑鄙、残忍的奴隶主的刻划，揭露出今天的殖民主义者的丑恶面貌。剧本曾获得里约热内卢市政局颁发的奖金。这个戏在巴西、拉丁美洲和苏联、希腊，以及维也纳等地的演出均获得极大成功。“伊索”是我国上演的第一个拉丁美洲的戏。由陈颙担任导演，演员有吕齐、舒绣文、方琯德、吕恩、杨薇、平原、刘勤。（附图片）
