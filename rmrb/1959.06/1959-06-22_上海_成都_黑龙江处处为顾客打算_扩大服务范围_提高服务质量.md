    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st: Shanghai's 60,000 catering service industry workers are trying in every way to increase service capacity and improve labor efficiency in order to meet customer needs as much as possible.
    The barber industry has adopted methods such as service staff taking turns to rest, shops opening in shifts, and adding service points in the evening, so that more customers can get a haircut during their spare time. The laundry and dyeing business is now in its peak season. In order to wash and dye more clothes for citizens, laundry and ironing personnel are not only helping each other to improve work efficiency, but also organizing some neighborhood women and family members of employees to assist in laundry.
    Various industries have also extensively carried out technological innovation, creating and reforming various tools and equipment. The electric washing machine manufactured by laundry and dyeing shop employees can wash 1,500 pieces of clothing a day; the sesame seed cake oven in the catering industry can bake 5,000 sesame seed cakes per hour.
    Employees are considering customers in every way, creating a variety of service methods. Recently, according to the needs of residents, the catering industry has added some retail outlets in the factory areas to supply breakfast. The hotel industry has added more than 6,000 beds by adopting methods such as setting up temporary beds. Now most industries have door-to-door service. Catering industry employees make snacks in factories, hairdressers go to neighborhoods to give haircuts to elderly, sick residents and children, and photographers bring cameras to take pictures at home. In addition, many industries have expanded their service items or carried out comprehensive business operations to facilitate customers. Many laundry and dyeing shops in Changning, Xuhui and other districts now provide customers with matching buttons, repairing clothes, changing collars, and oiling oilcloth raincoats. Some service stores have also restored the business characteristics that were once interrupted.
    Recently, more than 4,000 restaurants and stalls in the city have comprehensively checked and calculated the quality, specifications, and costs of dishes, and adjusted the specifications and prices of some dishes based on the principle of pricing according to quality. They also try to increase the variety of dishes and make them more delicious.
    Shanghai's catering service industry employees have also universally launched a red flag movement to actively improve service attitudes. Bathroom attendants take the initiative to help the elderly and children bathe, hotel attendants sew clothes and invite doctors for travelers, and laundry and dyeing shops and photo studios instruct customers on how to store clothes and take pictures.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 20th: Chengdu's service industry is actively restoring and expanding the service network for the lives of the people in the city, and is also improving the quality of service.
    More than 30 repair businesses have been restored and expanded throughout the city. More than ten larger district-owned factories, such as the Jinjun Leather Shoe Factory and the Xinghuo Leather Goods Factory, have added repair outlets, and some have also established mobile repair service teams. Commercial departments, based on the principle of repairing what they sell, have gradually added repair services in stores with suitable conditions. Various street offices have also organized life service stations and sewing groups among residents.
    In the process of restoring and expanding service businesses, relevant departments have implemented the principle of combining centralization and decentralization. The Xicheng District Commercial Department has added simple repair tools and air pumps to the cooperative shops that rent bicycles to make up for the shortage of professional bicycle repair shops. Some units have also adopted methods such as parading the streets, door-to-door service, and appointment registration to carry out repair services.
    Service industries such as hairdressing, laundry and dyeing, photography, and teahouses also facilitate the masses in many ways. Many barber shops have adopted the "appointment-based haircut" method, and increased or decreased daily business hours according to the busy and slack business rules, reducing congestion. In order to meet customer needs, the photography industry implements door-to-door photography and shortens the pick-up time. Many teahouses have added service stations where passers-by can drink enough tea at the service station for only one cent; if they want to cook porridge or noodles, it can also be done for one cent.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 21st: The Finance and Trade Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a symposium of representatives of service industries in the province in Harbin to exchange work experience and improve service quality. During the meeting, Ouyang Qin, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and other responsible comrades received all the representatives attending the meeting and encouraged them to further do their work well and serve the people enthusiastically.
    Thirty-five representatives from service industries in fifteen cities and counties extensively exchanged their experience in service work. Li Yuzhen, a female attendant at the Baiquan County State-run Hostel, has overcome many difficulties in recent years, trying every means to help travelers arrange their travel life, sew clothes and wash socks for them, and decoct soup and boil medicine for the sick, so that travelers can handle their own affairs without worry. Li Hongen, an old chef at the Jiangnanchun Restaurant in Nangang District, Harbin, and Ban Cuixia, a female chef at the "March 8th" Restaurant in Daowai District, Harbin, often use their spare time to provide technical guidance to many canteens. The representatives unanimously stated that they would learn these experiences well and further improve the quality of service work.
    At the symposium, the representatives also put forward many suggestions on adding service outlets, improving equipment, reasonably adjusting business hours, and strengthening business learning.

    上海　成都　黑龙江处处为顾客打算
    扩大服务范围  提高服务质量
    据新华社上海21日电　上海市六万名饮食服务行业的职工，正在多方设法增加服务能力、提高劳动效率，尽量满足顾客需要。
    理发业采取服务员轮班休息、各店交叉营业和晚上增设服务点等办法，让更多顾客在工作之暇能够理发。洗染业的业务，现在正是旺季。为了替市民洗染更多衣服，洗衣和烫衣的人员一面采取互相帮忙的办法，提高工作效率；一面组织部分里弄妇女和职工家属协助洗衣。
    各个行业还广泛开展技术革新，创造和改革各种工具设备。洗染店职工制造的电动洗衣机，一天可以洗衣一千五百件；饮食业的烧饼烘炉，每小时能够烘焙五千只烧饼。
    职工们处处为顾客打算，创造了多种多样的服务方式。最近一个时期来，饮食业根据居民需要，在工厂区一带增设了一些门市部供应早点。旅馆业采取设置临时床铺等办法，增加了六千多只床位。现在大部分行业都有上门服务的方式。饮食业职工上工厂做点心，理发师下里弄为年老、多病的居民和孩子们理发，摄影人员带着照相机上门拍照。另外，许多行业扩大了服务项目，或者开展综合经营业务便利顾客。长宁、徐汇等区的不少洗染店，现在代客配钮扣、修补衣服、换领子和给油布雨衣上油。有些服务商店也恢复了一度中断的经营特色。
    最近，全市四千多家饮食店、摊，全面检查、核算了菜点的质量、规格和成本，根据按质论价的原则，调整了部分菜点的规格和售价。他们又尽量增加花色品种，把菜点做得更加鲜美可口。
    上海饮食服务业职工还普遍开展红旗运动，积极改善服务态度。浴室服务员主动帮助老年人和小孩子洗澡，旅馆服务员为旅客缝衣服、请医生，洗染店、照相馆服务员指导顾客如何收藏衣服和摄影。
    据新华社成都20日电　成都市服务行业积极恢复和扩大为全市人民生活服务的服务网，并且提高服务的质量。
    全市恢复和扩大的修补业务已有三十多项。进军皮鞋厂、星火皮件厂等十多个较大的区属工厂中，都增设了修理门市部，有的还成立了外出流动修理服务队。商业部门根据卖啥修啥的原则，逐步在有条件的商店增加了修理业务。各街道办事处也在居民中组织起生活服务站、缝补组等。
    各有关部门在恢复和扩大服务业务中，实行了集中与分散相结合的原则。西城区商业部门在出租自行车的合作商店中，增加了简单的修理工具和打气筒，以弥补自行车专业修理店的不足。有些单位还采取游街串巷、上门服务和预约登记的办法，开展修补业务。
    理发、洗染、照相、茶社等服务业，也从多方面便利群众。许多理发店采取了“预约定时理发”办法，并根据业务忙闲规律，增减每天营业时间，减少了拥挤现象。照相业为了满足顾客需要，实行上门拍照，并缩短取件时间。许多茶社增添了服务站，来往过客只要花一分钱，就能在服务站喝足茶水；如果要煨稀饭、煮挂面，花一分钱也可以办到。
    据新华社哈尔滨21日电　中共黑龙江省委财贸部最近在哈尔滨市召开全省服务行业人员代表座谈会，交流工作经验，提高服务质量。会议期间，省委第一书记欧阳钦等负责同志接见了到会全体代表，勉励他们进一步做好自己的工作，热情地为人民服务。
    来自十五个市、县服务性行业的三十五名代表，广泛地交流了服务工作的经验。拜泉县国营旅社女服务员李玉珍，几年来克服了重重困难，想方设法帮助旅客安排旅行生活，为他们缝衣洗袜，为患病者煎汤熬药，让旅客们无牵无挂地去办理自己的事情。哈尔滨市南岗区江南春饭店老厨师李洪恩，哈尔滨市道外区“三八”饭店女厨师班翠霞等，经常利用业余时间到许多食堂进行技术指导。代表们一致表示，要很好地学习这些经验，进一步提高服务工作质量。
    座谈会上，代表们对增设服务网点，改进设备，合理调整营业时间，以及加强业务学习等，也提出了许多建议。
