　　Yutianpu Main Shaft Put Into Production Ahead of Schedule
　　The first fully mechanized new-type mine in the Southwest region - the Yutianpu No. 1 Shaft of the Nantong Coal Mine, has been completed and put into production ahead of schedule recently, after two years and four months of intensive construction. It is expected to produce 800,000 tons of coking coal this year.
　　The Yutianpu mine was designed by Chinese technicians with the help of Soviet experts. In the process of constructing these mines, the miners fought against gas and water inrush, and put forward more than 23,000 technical innovation proposals. The implementation of these proposals not only accelerated the progress of the project but also reduced the investment cost per ton of coal, saving a large amount of investment for the country.

    鱼田堡大竖井提前投入生产
    西南地区第一座全部机械化的新型矿井——南桐煤矿鱼田堡一号竖井，经过两年零四个月的紧张施工，已在最近提前建成投入生产。预计在今年内就可生产八十万吨炼焦煤。
    鱼田堡矿井是在苏联专家帮助下，由我国技术人员设计的。在建设这对矿井的过程中，矿工们与瓦斯、涌水搏斗，提出的技术革新建议达二万三千多项。这些建议的实施，不仅加快了工程进度，而且降低了每吨煤投资成本，为国家节约了大量投资。
