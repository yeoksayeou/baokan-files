    A Harvest Diary
    Li Xue'ao
      Good News
    Hearing we were helping the farmers with the wheat harvest,
    Joy immediately filled my heart.
    Not even taking time to change out of my work clothes,
    I hurried towards the countryside.
      Reaping Wheat
    The wheat ears are heavy,
    The sickles are shining bright,
    One hand holds the wheat, the other the sickle,
    What a great group of "hairdressers,"
    Just listen to the whirring sound,
    Wheat bundles piled up like mountains.
      Praising the Wheat
    Golden wheat ears, yellow and yellow.
    Each ear is fully four inches long.
    I shake hands tightly with the old farmer,
    A phrase bursts from my chest:
    Even if all the wheat ears were linked in a row,
    They could not measure our friendship!

    麦收小记
    李学鳌
      喜讯
    听说帮农民麦收，
    顿时喜上心头。
    来不及换掉工服，
    飞步向城外奔走。
      割麦
    麦穗沉甸甸，
    镰刀亮闪闪，
    一手握麦一手镰，
    好一群“理发员”，
    只听喳喳响，
    麦捆堆成山。
      夸麦
    金色麦穗黄又黄。
    穗穗足有四寸长。
    我同老农紧握手，
    一句话儿冲出腔：
    把所有麦穗连成行，
    也无法将咱们的友谊来衡量！
