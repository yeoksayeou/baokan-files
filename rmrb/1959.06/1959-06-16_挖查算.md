    Dig, Investigate, Calculate
    Cheng Li
    Recently, I've become quite interested in the words "dig," "investigate," and "calculate." Every time I read documents, look at newspapers, and encounter phrases like "digging potential," "investigating warehouses," "calculating detailed accounts," or numerical designations like "several digs," "several investigations," and "several calculations," I always want to see how much potential is dug out, what problems are investigated, and what results are calculated. Once I start looking, I become more and more interested.

    Indeed, these few words don't mean much on their own. However, looking at the results of digging, investigating, and calculating makes us feel their weight.

    Because, to dig, investigate, and calculate, one must go to the site, delve into reality, and conduct specific analyses of concrete matters after digging, investigating, and calculating. In this way, things that have long been buried, unnoticed, or unvalued are dug out. After further investigation and calculation, people see the magnitude of the potential power, the number of problems, and where the way out lies. This gives people a clear understanding, a clear mind, bright eyes, increased confidence, and greater enthusiasm.

    This working method may be a reflection of increasingly meticulous economic work because it is much more detailed compared to working methods based on "roughly," "estimating," and "almost."

    Some people say that digging, investigating, and calculating in economic work mainly focuses on reducing expenditure, which is a passive aspect. The implication is that it's not very meaningful and doesn't need to be emphasized. It is true that reducing expenditure is a passive aspect compared to increasing revenue, I agree. But I do not agree that it does not need to be emphasized, and I believe that it is extremely necessary to vigorously promote it. Let me give some examples:

    In Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, during the summer harvest, through re-collection, re-threshing, and re-inspection, more than five million catties of spring grains such as wheat, peas, and broad beans were recovered (see the front page of the People's Daily on June 7).

    Shenyang City launched a waste recovery campaign starting on March 20. By the end of May, the value of recovered waste materials had reached 6.6 million yuan (see the front page of the People's Daily on June 8).

    A certain government agency usually pays attention to saving. But this time, they launched another digging, investigating, and calculating movement to save office supplies. From the "small warehouses" in various departments, offices, and individual desks, they dug out great potential, investigated many things, and after calculation, some items could be used for half a year, and some could be used for a year. This changed the past practice of issuing office supplies monthly according to regulations, saving a lot of things.

    These examples all fall within the category of digging, investigating, and calculating, i.e., reducing expenditure. But, if the digging, investigating, and calculating methods of this one prefecture, one city, and one government agency are extended to every enterprise, people's commune, production team, government organization, school, and family throughout the country, how much grain, materials, and funds will be dug out! And it will bring great benefits to expanding reproduction. Isn't this a great prospect worth greatly emphasizing?

    The significance of digging, investigating, and calculating lies not only in its economic effects but also in the fact that, through the working methods of digging, investigating, and calculating, our economic workers can constantly understand the actual situation, correctly carry out work, and rationally and economically use financial, material, and human resources to complete production tasks effectively. Through this in-depth and meticulous working method, we can learn scientific economic management, continuously improve management levels, and make economic work more meticulous day by day, so that every penny, every item, and every work hour can exert greater economic effects. Isn't its significance small?

    Our country is a large country with a vast economy and boundless potential. A little digging, a little investigation, and a little calculation can reveal incalculable potential. At the same time, due to the continuous improvement of our production technology level and labor productivity, no matter how much we dig every day, there will always be inexhaustible potential forces.

    Because our country is large and our economy is vast, a little tightening can save hundreds of millions of financial and material resources. Conversely, a little loosening can also waste hundreds of millions of financial and material resources. Isn't there a need to emphasize digging, investigating, and calculating, and to emphasize reducing expenditure?

    Of course, solely emphasizing reducing expenditure while neglecting increasing revenue would turn reducing expenditure into water without a source and a tree without roots, which is wrong. Increasing revenue must be prioritized. However, neglecting reducing expenditure, no matter how much is produced or how large the income is, it will be eaten up, used up, and even the capital for increasing revenue will be wasted. As the saying goes, "Eating won't make you poor, wearing won't make you poor, but failing to calculate will make you poor for life."

    挖查算
    承里
    近来，我对挖、查、算几个字，颇感兴趣。每次读文件，看报纸，遇到挖潜力，查仓库，算细账，或标明数字的几挖、几查、几算的字样，总要看看挖出多大潜力，查出什么问题，算出什么结果。不看则已，越看就越引起我的兴趣。
    的确，单从这几个字看，也没啥意思。可是，看看挖、查、算的结果，就会使我们感到它的分量了。
    因为，要挖、要查、要算，就得到现场，深入实际，经过挖、查、算，对具体事物，进行具体分析。这样，长期埋没，没被发觉或不为人重视的东西，被挖出来了，再经过一番查、算，就使人们看到潜在力量之大，问题之多，出路何在，从而使人们心中有数，头脑清醒，眼睛明亮，信心提高，干劲更大了。
    这种工作方法，可能就是经济工作越做越细致的反映，因为它与“大概”、“估计”、“差不多”式的工作方法比较起来，要细致的多了。
    有人说，经济工作中的挖、查、算，主要着眼于节流，是消极的方面。言外之意，是没啥意思，不必强调。不错，节流与开源比起来，是消极方面，我同意。但说到不必强调，我不赞成，而且认为有大力提倡的极大必要。不妨举些例子：
    四川省内江专区，在夏收中，经过复收、复打、复查，收回小麦、豌豆、胡豆等小春粮食五百多万斤（见6月7日人民日报第一版）。
    沈阳市从3月20日开始，展开一个废品收回突击运动，到5月底，已经回收的废旧物资，价值六百六十万元（见6月8日人民日报第一版）。
    某机关，平日是注意节约的。但这次又来一个挖、查、算办公用品的节约运动，从各处、室和个人办公桌的“小仓库”里，挖出很大的潜力，查出不少东西，经过一算，有的可以用半年，有的可以用一年。这样，就改变了过去逐月按规定领发办公用品的情况，节约出好多东西。
    这些例子，都属于挖、查、算，即节流范畴内的事情。可是，把这一个专区、一个市、一个机关的挖、查、算的办法，推广到全国的每个企业、人民公社和生产队、机关团体、学校、家庭中去，将会有多少粮食、物资和资金，被挖出来呢！而且它将对于扩大再生产带来极大好处。难道这不是大有可为，值得大大强调的吗？
    挖、查、算的意义，还不仅在于它的经济效果本身，同时，通过挖、查、算的工作方法，使我们的经济工作人员，经常地了解实际情况，正确地进行工作，合理而又节约的使用财力、物力、人力，经济而有效的完成生产任务。并通过这种深入细致的工作方法，学会科学的管理经济工作，不断提高管理水平，把经济工作做的一天比一天细致，使每一分钱、每一件物资、每一个工时，都能发挥出更大的经济效果，它的意义难道还小吗？
    我们的国家，是一个大国，家大业大，有无穷的潜力，稍微挖一挖，查一查，算一算，就能找出难以估量的潜力。同时，由于我们的生产技术水平不断提高，劳动生产效率不断提高，尽管每天挖，都有挖不尽的潜在力量。
    由于我们家大业大，稍微紧一紧，就能节约出数以亿计的财力、物力。相反，稍微松一松，也能浪费掉数以亿计的财力、物力。难道，没有强调挖、查、算，强调节流的必要吗？
    当然，单纯强调节流，忽视开源，就把节流变成无源之水，无本之木，这是错误的。必须把开源放在第一位。但是，忽视节流，尽管生产的再多，收入的再大，也会吃掉，用完，甚至连开源的本钱，也浪费光。正像俗语所说的：“吃不穷，穿不穷，计算不到一世穷。”
