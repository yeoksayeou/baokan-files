    Song of the Summer Harvest
    Li Xingwen
        Reaping Wheat
    The mountains are high and the river is winding,
    The commune's wheat sea connects to the blue sky,
    The south wind blows and turns golden waves,
    Waves of wheat fragrance refresh the heart.
    The commune's wheat sea turns golden waves,
    Songs resound to the heavens in the waves,
    Pale white straw hats float on the wave surface,
    In the blink of an eye, golden waves become golden mountains.
      Threshing
    The windmill sings, pearls fall,
    The windmill sings the song of the harvest,
    Wheat chaff rides the east wind and rises,
    Pearls pile up into stacks on the threshing ground.
    Pearls pile up into stacks on the threshing ground,
    Every pearl brings joy to the heart,
    Hundreds and thousands of faces share the same expression:
    Smiling broadly, relaxed and happy.

    夏收之歌
    李兴文
        割麦
    山高高呀河弯弯，
    公社麦海接蓝天，
    南风吹来翻金浪，
    阵阵麦香沁心间。
    公社麦海金浪翻，
    浪里歌声响连天，
    粉白草帽漂浪面，
    转眼金浪变金山。
      脱粒
    风车响，珍珠落，
    风车唱着丰收歌，
    麦糠乘着东风扬，
    场上珍珠堆成垛。
    场上珍珠堆成垛，
    粒粒珍珠乐心窝，
    千百张脸一副像：
    舒眉展颜笑呵呵。
