Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 5th June: The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region now has over 90,000 Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic minority technical workers, technicians, and enterprise management cadres. They are distributed in hundreds of factories and mines across the Tianshan Mountains, becoming an important force in the construction of the Autonomous Region.

In the past, Xinjiang had almost no modern industry. When it was liberated in 1949, there were very few ethnic minority workers. The Transportation Bureau of the Autonomous Region's Department of Transportation only had four ethnic minority car drivers and repair workers in 1950. In the past ten years, the Party and the government have adopted various measures to actively train local ethnic minority technical workers and cadres, sending large numbers of ethnic minority workers to factories and mines in the interior for study and visits every year, running short-term training classes, and using methods such as assigning Han Chinese master workers to train apprentices. The Autonomous Region has also established petroleum colleges, mining and metallurgy colleges, and various vocational schools for industry and transportation, post and telecommunications, electricity, and chemical engineering to train ethnic minority technical cadres.

With the great leap forward in industrial production in the Autonomous Region in 1958, the ranks of ethnic minority workers rapidly expanded. In the Autonomous Region's coal industry, ethnic minority workers accounted for more than 58%, with the number increasing from 226 in 1949 to more than 32,000. Among the more than 10,000 ethnic minority workers on the petroleum industry front, more than 600 hold positions such as technicians, engineers, section chiefs, and factory directors.

    新疆少数民族职工已有九万多
    分布在天山南北的数百厂矿　成为建设自治区的重要力量
    据新华社乌鲁木齐5日电　新疆维吾尔自治区已经有了九万多名维吾尔、哈萨克等少数民族的技术工人、技术人员和企业管理干部，他们分布在天山南北数百个厂矿企业中，成为建设自治区的一支重要力量。
    新疆过去几乎没有什么现代工业，1949年解放时少数民族职工很少，自治区交通厅运输局在1950年才只有四名少数民族汽车驾驶员和修理工人。近十年来，党和政府采取各种措施，积极培养本地民族的技术工人和干部，每年选送大批少数民族职工到内地厂矿学习和参观，开办短期训练班，并用指定汉族师傅带徒弟等办法培养少数民族工人。自治区还开办了石油学院、矿冶学院和工业交通、邮电、电业、化工等各种专业学校，培养少数民族技术干部。
    随着1958年自治区工业生产大跃进，少数民族的职工队伍迅速壮大。在自治区煤炭工业中，少数民族职工占到58％以上，人数由1949年的二百二十六人增加到三万两千多人。石油工业战线上的一万多名少数民族职工中，有六百多名担任技术员、工程师、处长、厂长等职务。
