    Cangling Management District
    Surveying Fields to Eliminate Wasteland and Rush Planting and Sowing
    Kunming, 5th (by our own correspondent) The Cangling Management District of the Cangling People's Commune in Chuxiong County, Yunnan Province, has launched a mass campaign to survey fields and eliminate wasteland, expanding rice paddy fields by 833 mu and corn fields by more than 500 mu.
    After the production quotas were implemented in this management district, the production teams and commune members showed great enthusiasm and confidence. Therefore, as soon as the planting season arrived, they quickly completed the planting tasks. Following this, the entire management district, under the slogan of "No land left uncultivated, harvest ten thousand dan of grain," launched a mass campaign to survey fields and eliminate wasteland to expand the planting area. The entire management district identified more than 1,300 mu of contiguous and scattered idle fields and land. The production teams promptly organized manpower and livestock to transport fertilizer, soak the fields, and rush planting and sowing. The Dingjiatun Production Team has already planted nearly 100 mu of seedlings on the 174.6 mu of fallow land they found. In addition to expanding their own planting by 46 mu, the Canglinggang Production Team also supported other production teams with the seedlings from the remaining 130 mu of fields.

    苍岭管理区
    查田灭荒抢栽抢种
    本报昆明5日电  云南省楚雄县苍岭人民公社苍岭管理区，开展群众性的查田灭荒，扩大了八百三十三亩稻田，五百多亩包谷。
    这个管理区的包产落实以后，生产队和社员的干劲很大，信心也足，所以一进栽种季节，很快完成了栽种任务，接着全管理区在“不荒分寸土、多收万担粮”的口号下，开展群众性的查田灭荒扩大栽种面积工作。全管理区共找出了成片的和零星闲田闲地一千三百多亩，各生产队及时组织人畜力运肥、泡田，进行抢栽抢种。丁家屯生产队找出的一百七十四亩六分熟荒地，已栽秧近一百亩，苍岭岗生产队除了自己扩栽了四十六亩秧外，还把剩下的一百三十多亩田的秧苗，支援其他生产队。
