To Radically Improve Steel Quality
Hebei Province Summarizes Experience and Proposes Sixteen Measures

(Our newspaper Tianjin, 10th dispatch) The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has synthesized effective experiences in steel smelting and formulated sixteen measures to increase posts at every stage and set up defenses on all fronts, from mining and ironmaking to steelmaking and ingot casting. The goal is to ensure the rapid realization of large-scale high-quality and high-yield in the province's steel industry.

In Hebei Province's steel smelting, small blast furnaces and converters account for the largest proportion. Since March, employees on the province's steel front have launched a "six comparisons" competition for high production and high quality. Effective advanced experiences such as parallel fan operation, multi-nozzle combustion, roasting ore, and using indigenous methods to sinter powdered ore have been promoted in small blast furnaces. Experiences such as desulfurization in molten iron furnaces, increasing wind temperature, and three-step desulfurization have been promoted in converter steelmaking. The quality of steel has improved significantly. However, the implementation of these advanced experiences is not entirely consistent, systematic, or comprehensive between regions, factories, furnaces, and even shifts and teams. For example, some ironmaking plants have implemented advanced experiences such as parallel fan operation, increased air volume, and multi-nozzle combustion, which have increased the utilization coefficient and desulfurization capacity of small blast furnaces. However, coking coal has not been washed before entering the furnace, resulting in high ash content and the inability to quickly reduce the sulfur content of pig iron, directly affecting the quality of steel ingots. In converter steelmaking, some factories have only promoted experiences such as increasing furnace temperature and external desulfurization, and have not paid enough attention to the method of alkaline molten iron furnace desulfurization, continuing to use acidic molten iron furnaces. This has prevented the full utilization of the desulfurization capacity of the molten iron furnace. As a result, the quality of pig iron is not stable enough, and although the qualified rate of steel ingots has increased month by month, there are few first-class products.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party systematically studied the effective experiences in technical operation and production management of small blast furnaces and converters, and based on the province's conditions, comprehensively and systematically summarized these experiences into sixteen measures to fundamentally solve the problem of steel quality.

These sixteen measures to improve quality are divided equally, with eight measures each for steelmaking and ironmaking. The eight major measures for ironmaking are: Based on conditions such as coal, iron ore, and transportation, and following the principle of appropriate concentration and ease of leadership, re-designate and re-locate factories, dividing the province's ironmaking plants into three categories; improve the quality of coal washing and coking, ensuring that coal is not coked without washing, and requiring all 240 No. 2 simple coking furnaces in the province to be completed and put into production in July; comprehensively renovate small blast furnaces, increase air volume, increase wind temperature, and implement high-wind and high-temperature operations, ensuring that the air volume blown into the furnace per minute is four to seven times the furnace volume, and the furnace temperature reaches 600 to 650 degrees Celsius. The small blast furnace renovation project is required to be completed by the end of July; strengthen raw material management, improve the quality of ore and limestone, appropriately reduce the particle size of the ore, and ensure that both ore and limestone are roasted, and powdered ore is sintered, ensuring that the small blast furnace "eats cooked, not raw"; improve the desulfurization effect inside and outside the furnace, increase slag alkalinity, and after the molten iron is discharged, use desulfurizing agents such as lime powder for external desulfurization; strengthen the maintenance of blast furnace equipment, and key factories must be equipped with a certain mechanical repair force, and each special district and city must have one or two mechanical repair factories specializing in repair and assembly for ironmaking plants; establish and improve the quality inspection system, and raw materials and pig iron must be tested. Pig iron with a sulfur content exceeding 0.4% is not allowed to leave the factory; implement pricing based on quality for pig iron. The eight major measures for converter steelmaking are: convert acidic molten iron furnaces into alkaline molten iron furnaces to improve desulfurization efficiency; add hot air devices to molten iron furnaces to increase the temperature of molten iron to over 1400 degrees Celsius; steel mills establish lime kilns to improve the quality of desulfurizing agents; increase the production capacity of silicon manganese iron to ensure supply; improve technical operations, establish and improve technical management systems; add hoisting and transportation equipment to solve in-plant transportation; improve the quality of coke and refractory materials.

In order to ensure that these sixteen measures are implemented item by item, the Provincial Industrial Production Committee, in coordination with relevant departments such as the Provincial Planning Commission and the Metallurgical Bureau, is studying each item. In recent days, professional meetings on converter steelmaking and small blast furnace technical transformation have been held, and practical arrangements have been made for each item, striving to achieve a qualified rate of 90% for pig iron and a qualified rate of over 90% for converter steel ingots in the province in July, and to gradually increase the proportion of first-class products in qualified products and eliminate zero-grade steel.

    从根本上着手提高钢铁质量
    河北省总结经验提出十六项措施
    本报天津10日电　中共河北省委综合了钢铁冶炼方面行之有效的经验，制订出十六项措施，从采矿、炼铁直到炼钢、铸锭的各个环节上，关关增岗，面面设防，保证迅速实现全省钢铁工业大面积优质丰产。
    河北省钢铁冶炼中占比重最大的是小高炉和转炉设备。从3月份以来，全省钢铁战线上的职工开展了高产优质的“六比”竞赛。在小高炉方面推广了风机并联、多嘴燃烧、焙烧矿石、土法烧结粉矿等行之有效的先进经验；在转炉炼钢方面推广了化铁炉脱硫、加大风温、三步脱硫等经验，钢铁的质量已有显著的提高。但是在地区与地区、厂与厂、炉与炉以至班、组之间，在贯彻执行这些先进经验的时候还不完全一致，也不系统、不全面。比如有的炼铁厂推行了风机并联、加大风量和多嘴燃烧等先进经验，提高了小高炉的利用系数和脱硫能力；可是炼焦煤在入炉以前没有经过洗选，焦灰分很大，使生铁的含硫量不能很快地降低，并且直接影响到钢锭的质量。在转炉炼钢方面，有的厂只推行了提高炉温、炉外脱硫等经验，对于碱性化铁炉脱硫的方法重视不足，仍然使用酸性化铁炉化铁，不能充分发挥化铁炉的脱硫能力。因而，生铁的质量还不够稳定，钢锭的合格率虽然逐月上升，但是一级品较少。
    中共河北省委系统地研究了小高炉和转炉在技术操作、生产管理上行之有效的经验，并且根据本省的条件，把这些经验全面、系统地归纳为十六项措施，从根本上解决钢铁质量的问题。
    这十六项提高质量的措施，炼钢和炼铁方面各占八项。炼铁方面的八大措施是：根据煤、铁矿石以及交通运输等条件，按照适当集中，便于领导的原则，重新定点、定厂，把全省的炼铁厂划分为三类；提高洗煤炼焦的质量，作到不洗煤不炼焦，并要求全省二百四十座二号简易炼焦炉在7月份全部建成投入生产；全面改装小高炉，加大风量、提高风温，实行大风高温操作，保证每分钟鼓入炉内的风量为高炉容积的四至七倍，炉温达到六百度到六百五十度，小高炉改装工程要求在7月底全部完成；加强原料管理，提高矿石和石灰石的质量，适当缩小矿石粒度，作到矿石、石灰石都要经过焙烧，粉矿经过烧结，保证小高炉吃熟不吃生；提高炉内炉外的脱硫效果，提高炉渣碱度，铁水流出以后，要用石灰粉等脱硫剂进行炉外脱硫；加强高炉设备的维修工作，重点厂都要配备一定的机修力量，各专、市都要有一两个专为炼铁厂搞修配的机修厂；建立和健全质量检验制度，原料和生铁都要进行化验，凡含硫量超过百分之零点四以上的生铁不准出厂；对生铁实行依质论价。在转炉炼钢方面的八大措施是：把酸性化铁炉改装为碱性化铁炉，提高脱硫效率；化铁炉增添热风装置，把铁水温度提高到一千四百度以上；炼钢厂建立石灰窑，提高脱硫剂的质量；提高矽锰铁的生产能力，保证供应；改进技术操作，建立和健全技术管理制度；增添起重、运输设备，解决厂内运输；提高焦炭、耐火材料的质量。
    为了使这十六项措施条条落实，以省工业生产委员会为主，协同省计委、冶金局等有关部门逐条进行研究。连日来，已召开了转炉炼钢、小高炉技术改造等专业会议，条条作了切实安排，争取在7月份全省生铁的合格率达到90％，转炉钢锭的合格率达到90％以上，并在合格品中逐步增加一级品，消灭零号钢。
