People Who Maintain the Health of the Open Hearth Furnace
    ——A Story of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace Workers Maintaining the Furnace Body
    By our reporter Wang Dianxue
    During my visit to the No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel, I saw and heard many touching stories. The steel heroes who fought day and night on the open hearth furnace treated the maintenance of the furnace as if it were their own family, with meticulous care and attention.
    What is described here are just a few glimpses of it.
    The Chief Furnace Operator's Habit
    At six o'clock in the morning, long before work started, Chief Furnace Operator Cui Yushen, like an accurate clock, was already at the No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace. Through his blue glasses, he watched the front and back walls of the furnace, checking whether they had been eroded by molten steel; then he climbed to the top of the furnace to see if there was any dust; then he turned to the bottom of the furnace to see if there was any slag or steel leaking... Any negligence in the maintenance of the open hearth furnace could not escape his eyes. All four shifts of workers in the furnace had a common understanding: if they saw a smile on his face, it meant he was satisfied with the furnace body maintenance; if they saw his expression was heavy, then either the shift handover crew was about to be criticized, or the incoming crew was waiting to receive tasks.
    The chief furnace operator has been working on the open hearth furnace for a full ten years. As early as April 1949, when Anshan Iron and Steel's first open hearth furnace resumed production, he came to the open hearth furnace to learn steelmaking. In these ten years, he has been a steelmaking furnace operator, a full-time furnace maintenance technician, and last year he was transferred to this open hearth furnace to be the chief furnace operator. In his eyes, the open hearth furnace seemed to be a living thing, and he often said: if we don't maintain the furnace body well, there will be no way to produce more steel, and the open hearth furnace is the lifeblood of our steelmaking workers.
    One day at the beginning of this year, when he was checking the instrument records, he found that Yi shift furnace operator Li Tianxi only cared about shortening the time to make steel quickly, and gave too much gas when making steel. The chief furnace operator quickly ran to the furnace door, and through his blue glasses, he saw the molten steel rolling high, washing the back wall of the furnace. He hurriedly found Li Tianxi and warned him to pay attention to maintaining the furnace body. Although Li Tianxi reluctantly agreed, he immediately put the chief furnace operator's instructions out of his mind when he thought that the No. 5 open hearth furnace had been running ahead of them for several days in a row. He still worked hard as before. As a result, a piece was split off the back wall, and it took a lot of effort and five or six hours to repair it. Not only did they not catch up with the No. 5 open hearth furnace, but they were left even further behind.
    A piece was split off the back wall of the furnace, as if a piece of flesh had been cut from the chief furnace operator's body. He was so anxious and angry that he couldn't eat for several meals. The chief furnace operator secretly pondered, these young men only know how to load more and refine quickly, but how can they understand how to refine quickly and produce more, and also maintain the furnace body well? He went to the Party group leader and suggested holding an enlarged Party group meeting, using Li Tianxi's accident as an example, and organizing all the furnace workers to start a debate. The group leader agreed with his opinion, and after several debates, everyone presented the facts and reasoned, helping Li Tianxi and helping themselves.
    At first, some people always felt that the chief furnace operator was "nitpicking" and too careful; as time went on, people saw with their own eyes that the furnace had very few problems, and the steel output exceeded the quota every month, and only then did they realize that the chief furnace operator was doing the right thing. The chief furnace operator's habit gradually became everyone's habit.
    The Style of Bearing Hardship First
    Another deepest impression you get at the No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace is that everyone has the style of bearing hardship first.
    The work of maintaining the furnace body is hot and tiring, and you have to deal with high temperatures of hundreds of degrees, and you have to exchange sweat for the health of the open hearth furnace. Like patching the front wall, the workers have to face the long flames and shovel the refractory mud on one shovel at a time; like blowing the furnace top, the workers have to climb to the top of the furnace and stand there for thirty or forty minutes; especially when the furnace runs slag and steel, it is even more tiring to clean up... Although the work is relatively tiring, the workers of the No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace would rather do more themselves and let others do less.
    This style was also gradually formed. At first, some people did not regard the work that everyone did as their own business, and tried their best to push the tiring work to other people or other shifts. In order to prevent this irresponsible practice, they once stipulated a system: when handing over shifts, if it is found that the work of maintaining the furnace body has not been completed, the incoming shift has the right to keep the outgoing shift and let them finish the work before going back. As a result, today you keep me on duty, and tomorrow I keep you on duty, creating a gap between each other, and the furnace body has not been maintained well. Jia shift furnace operator and Communist Party member Luo Yuandi often thought to himself: if we want to maintain the furnace body well, we must strengthen the unity of the four shifts, and someone must take the lead, bear hardships first, and do more work. He asked himself: you are a Communist Party member, if you don't take the lead, who are you waiting for to take the lead?
    Once, Ding shift furnace operator Zhao Jingliang was busy operating the furnace to make steel, and the molten steel in the furnace suddenly boiled violently. Because the cold material was not loaded well in advance, the molten steel in the eastern half of the furnace rolled more and more violently, and suddenly slag and molten steel flowed out along the outlet at the eastern end, and soon welded the furnace body and the furnace head together. He was busy taking care of steelmaking, and also busy temporarily organizing manpower to rescue and clean up the spilled slag and steel, and worked hard until the end of the shift, and had not cleaned up even one-third. Jia shift had already come to take over the shift. When Jia shift furnace operator Luo Yuandi saw it, he estimated that it would probably not be cleaned up even after another shift, but he calmly persuaded Zhao Jingliang: Look at how tired you are, quickly take a bath and go home to rest, we will take care of the rest of the work. Zhao Jingliang didn't say a word, thinking, how can we let Jia shift suffer for us because of the slag and steel that our shift spilled? He still lowered his head and worked. When Luo Yuandi saw that the workers in Ding shift were not leaving, he took the lead to grab the crowbars, shovels and other tools, and drove the workers in Ding shift back to rest. Later, Jia shift worked another shift for four hours, cleaned up the spilled slag and steel, and avoided an unplanned overhaul.
    Luo Yuandi led all the workers in the shift to work one shift and four hours, cleaned up the slag and steel, and avoided an unplanned overhaul.
    Luo Yuandi's actions of bearing hardship first, like a "locomotive," drove the four shifts in the entire furnace to help each other and trust each other. Now, there is no longer any mutual prevarication or mutual blame. And the original "shift handover system" has been guaranteed by the style of bearing hardship first and mutual trust.
    Technical Flowers Bloom in the Furnace
    Bing shift assistant Jiang Yinghou has been watching the erosion of the front wall of the furnace by molten steel during operation. Whenever it was their Bing shift's turn to make steel, Jiang Yinghou looked at the front wall of the furnace being washed by the boiling molten steel, and the outer steel armor gradually changed from black to red, and his heart was burning like fire. He often imagined how good it would be if he could come up with a way to maintain the front wall!
    Once, he found that Jia shift maintained the front wall very well. So he didn't go home after get off work, determined to learn Jia shift's operation.
    Originally, the poor maintenance of the front wall was also tormenting Jia shift furnace operator Luo Yuandi. Every time it was Jia shift's turn to make steel, as soon as the furnace was patched and the cold material was loaded, Luo Yuandi would rush to put refractory mud on the front wall, but before he could finish patching the two wall piers, it was time to pour molten iron. When he poured the first can of molten iron in, the furnace began to boil. Through his blue glasses, he watched the patched wall piers were safe and sound, and the unpatched wall piers were eroded by the molten steel. He was so anxious that he wanted to smear a layer of refractory mud on it with his hands. He wondered in his heart, how can I finish patching all four wall piers before pouring the molten iron? If one person works faster, he can patch two wall piers. If two people work at the same time, can't they finish patching all four wall piers! After several experiments, the original single-shovel patching of the front wall was changed to double-shovel patching of the front wall, and the patching speed was doubled. Finally, before pouring the molten iron, all four wall piers were patched. From then on, when the molten steel boiled, it no longer directly eroded the front wall.
    Jiang Yinghou followed Jia shift and observed for several times in a row, and felt that this method was very good. He thought in his heart that if the four shifts could do this, then there would be no need to worry about the maintenance of the front wall anymore. But after another consideration, he thought that each shift of eight people was like a radish in a pit, and the work of steelmaking was tightly linked. Where could he draw a person to work with the furnace operator to patch the front wall with double shovels? The more he thought about it, the more he felt that things were not that simple, so he took the lead and first tested and promoted it in their Bing shift, figured out the ideological problems, and found a way to solve the shortage of manpower. At this time, he began to organize the other two shifts to learn from Jia shift's experience. After this series of meticulous work by Jiang Yinghou, the experience of "patching the front wall with double shovels" was quickly promoted in the entire furnace. Then, it was quickly promoted in many fraternal open hearth furnaces.

    维护平炉健康的人们
    ——记鞍钢六号平炉工人维护炉体的故事
    本报记者　王殿学
    在鞍钢六号平炉访问期间，看到听到多少扣人心弦的故事。日夜奋战在平炉上的钢铁英雄们对待平炉的维护，像是对待自己的亲人，体贴入微，一丝不苟。
    这里记述的只是其中的点点滴滴。
    总炉长的习惯
    早晨六点钟，离上班还早呢，可是总炉长崔玉深，就像是准确的时钟，已经出现在六号平炉上。他透过蓝色眼镜，注视着炉子的前后墙，看看那里被钢水浸蚀了没有；接着他又爬到炉顶上去，看看那上面有没有灰尘；然后他又转到炉子下面，看看那里有没有跑渣跑钢……任何人对平炉维护的任何疏忽，都逃不过他那一双眼睛。全炉四班工人有一个共同的体会：如果看见他的脸上挂着笑容，那就是说他对炉体维护表示满意；如果看见他的表情很沉重，那不是交班的人们要挨批评，就是接班的人们得等着接受任务。
    总炉长在平炉上，已经工作了整整十年了。早在1949年4月，鞍钢第一座平炉恢复生产的时候，他就来到平炉上学习炼钢。在这十年当中，他当过炼钢炉长，做过专职护炉技师，去年又调到这座平炉上来做总炉长，平炉在他的眼睛里，像是有生命的东西，他常说：要是我们不把炉体维护好，就没有办法多炼钢，平炉是我们炼钢工人的命根子。
    今年年初有一天，他在检查仪表记录的时候，发觉乙班炉长李田锡，只顾缩短时间快炼钢，炼钢时给的煤气太多。总炉长赶快跑到炉门前，透过蓝色眼镜一看，只见翻起老高的钢水，在冲涮着炉子后墙，他急忙找到李田锡，警告他注意维护炉体。李田锡虽然勉勉强强答应了，可是他一转念想到，五号平炉一连几天跑在他们的前面，立即又把总炉长叮嘱放到九霄云外去了。他又照样猛干起来。结果把后墙给劈下了一块，费了好大的劲，用了五、六个小时才修好，不但没有赶上五号平炉，反而被拉下的更远了。
    炉子后墙劈下一块，好像从总炉长身上割下一块肉，他连急带气好几顿吃不下去饭。总炉长自己暗地思量，这些年青小伙子，就知道多装快炼，可是怎样让他们懂得既能快炼多炼，又能维护好炉体呢？他跑去找党小组长，建议开一次党小组扩大会，用李田锡的事故做例子，组织全炉职工展开辩论。小组长同意了他的意见，经过几次辩论，大家摆事实讲道理，帮助李田锡也帮助自己。
    起初，还有些人总觉得总炉长“吹毛求疵”，过于小心了；日子一长，人们亲眼看到炉子毛病很少，钢产量月月超额，这才体会到总炉长做的对。总炉长的习惯，逐渐地变成了大家的习惯。
    吃苦在前的风气
    在六号平炉上给你另一个最深的印象，就是人人都有吃苦在前的风格。
    维护炉体的活，都是些又热又累的活，要和几百度的高温打交道，得用汗水换取平炉的健康。像贴补前墙，工人们要迎着长长的火舌，一铲一铲地把耐火泥贴上去；像吹扫炉顶，工人们要爬到炉子顶上去，一站就是三四十分钟；特别是遇到炉子跑渣跑钢，清除起来就更加劳累……。尽管活儿比较劳累，可是六号平炉的工人们，都宁可自己多干，让别人少干。
    这种风气也是逐渐形成的。起初，有些人不把大家干的活，看成是自己的事情，尽可能把累活推给别的人、或别的班去干。为了防止这种不负责任的作法，他们曾经规定了一项制度：在交接班的时候，如果发现维护炉体的活没干完，接班的人有权把交班的人留下，让他们把活干完再回去。结果是，今天你留我连班，明天我留你连班，互相间产生隔膜，炉体还没有维护得好。甲班炉长、共产党员罗远弟，自己常常这样想：要想维护好炉体，必须加强四班团结，而且必须有人带头，吃苦在前，多干活。他自己问自己：你是共产党员，你不去带头，等谁来带头？
    有一次，丁班炉长赵景良，正在忙着操纵炉子炼钢，炉内的钢水突然大沸腾了。因为冷料事先装的不好，炉子东半部的钢水，越翻滚越厉害，猛然间渣子和钢水，顺着东头的喷出口流了出来，很快就把炉体和炉头给焊在一块了。他一面忙着照顾炼钢，又一面忙着临时组织人力抢救，清理跑出来的渣子和钢，一直苦战到下班的时候，还没清理完三分之一。甲班已经来接班了，甲班炉长罗远弟一看，估计再清理一个班的功夫，恐怕也清理不完，可是，他却不动声色地劝赵景良：看把你们累成啥样子了，赶快洗洗澡回家休息去吧，剩下的活我们包下了。赵景良没吭声，心想，我们班跑的渣子和钢，怎好让人家甲班替我们挨累呢？还是低着头干。罗远弟一看，丁班工人不走，他就带头把撬棍、铁锹等工具抢过来，把丁班工人撵回去休息。后来，甲班又干了一个班零四个多小时，把跑出的渣子和钢清理干净，避免了一次计划外检修。
    罗远弟带领全班工人干了一个班又干了四个钟头，把渣子和钢清理干净，避免了一次计划外检修。
    罗远弟这种吃苦在前的行动，像“火车头”一样带动了全炉四个班互相帮助，互相信任，现在再也找不到互相推托，互相埋怨的事情了。而原来的“交接班制度”，已经得到吃苦在前，互相信任的风气所保证了。
    技术之花开满炉
    丙班助手姜颖厚在操作中一直注视着炉子的前墙被钢水浸蚀的情况。每逢轮到他们丙班炼钢，姜颖厚看着炉子的前墙，被沸腾的钢水冲涮着，外面的钢甲，渐渐由黑变红，他的心就像是火烧一样。他常常设想，要是研究出一个维护前墙的办法来该多么好啊！
    有一次他发现甲班维护前墙很好。于是他下班以后不回家，决心学习甲班的操作。
    原来前墙维护不好这件事，同样在折磨着甲班炉长罗远弟。每次轮到甲班炼钢，刚刚补完炉、装完冷料，开始熔化的时候，罗远弟就抢时间，往前墙上贴耐火泥，可是没等他贴完两个墙垛，就到兑铁水的时候了，兑进第一罐铁水去，炉子就开始沸腾起来，他透过蓝色眼镜，看着贴补完的墙垛安然无恙，没有贴补的墙垛被钢水浸蚀着，急得恨不得用手去抹上一层耐火泥。他在心里琢磨，怎么才能在兑铁水之前，把四个墙垛都贴补完呢？要是一个人快一点干，能贴补完两个墙垛，要是两个人同时干，不就可以把四个墙垛都贴完么！经过几次试验，把原来单铲贴前墙，改为双铲贴前墙，贴补的速度加快了一倍，到底赶在兑铁水之前，就把四个墙垛都贴补完了。从此，钢水沸腾的时候，不再直接浸蚀前墙了。
    姜颖厚跟着甲班，连续观察了几次，觉得这个办法很好，心里想要是四个班都能这样干，那就用不着再愁前墙维护不好了。可是又一考虑，想到每班的八个人，都是一个萝卜顶一个坑，炼钢的活，又是一环紧扣一环，从那里抽出一个人来，和炉长一块，用双铲贴补前墙呢？他越想，越觉得事情并不那么简单，于是他又带头，先在他们丙班试验推广，摸清了思想问题，找出来解决人力不足的办法。这时他才着手，组织另外两个班，学习甲班的经验。经过姜颖厚这一系列细致的工作，“双铲贴补前墙”的经验，很快就在全炉推广了。接着，很快又在许多兄弟平炉上推广了。
