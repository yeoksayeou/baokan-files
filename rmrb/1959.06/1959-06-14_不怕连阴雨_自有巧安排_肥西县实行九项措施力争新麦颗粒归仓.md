Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 13th: The nine measures proposed by the Feixi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the people of the county to cleverly combat the continuous rain and strive for a bumper harvest have played a significant role in the wheat harvest. Currently, over 400,000 mu of the county's 480,000 mu of wheat have been harvested, and nearly 300,000 mu have been threshed.

The nine measures taken by the county to cleverly combat the rain are: First, fight the sky with intelligence, seize every opportunity. Plant rice seedlings when it rains, and rush to harvest when the rain stops. Second, distinguish between priorities. Harvest early-maturing, easily threshed varieties first, followed by late-maturing, difficult-to-thresh varieties; harvest low-lying areas such as lakeshores, weirs, riverbanks, and paddy fields first, followed by upland areas; harvest rice planting fields first, followed by dry land crop planting fields. Third, harvest and transport simultaneously. The harvested wheat should be transported to indoor spaces and spread out to dry in a timely manner; wheat transported to the threshing ground should be stacked and covered well. Fourth, make every effort to thresh the wheat. If threshing is not possible on the threshing ground due to rain, thresh indoors using a bushel bucket to prevent mold and rot. Fifth, take various measures to store the threshed, damp wheat. For example, use methods such as baking and drying to reduce moisture. If there is too much wet wheat, the canteen can adjust it according to regulations and food ration standards, eating the wet grain first and storing the dry grain. Sixth, exchange labor for labor and carry out cooperation. Production teams with smaller harvesting tasks should support those with larger tasks to ensure that all the wheat is harvested. Seventh, strengthen weather forecasting and the force of the harvesting battle, and widely mobilize government cadres, school teachers and students, factory workers, and residents to participate in the harvesting. Eighth, strengthen education on careful harvesting and threshing, and strive to avoid losing any grain during rainy-day harvesting. Ninth, the commune and team should hold forums with veteran farmers, consult with the masses more, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, study a variety of harvesting methods, and ensure that every grain is brought into the barn.

The vast masses of the county warmly support these measures, and a mass movement to cleverly combat the rain and strive for a good harvest was quickly launched. On May 28th, when weather forecasts of continuous rain were received from various places, immediate emergency action was taken, and the harvesting force quickly increased to nearly 200,000 people. After a day of tenacious fighting, a total of 100,500 mu of wheat was harvested. Seeing dark clouds in the sky and the threat of heavy rain, Gangji Commune immediately dispatched more than 70 cadres to take charge of specific areas, mobilized more than 8,800 people to carry out a concentrated rush to harvest and transport, and cleared out more than 1,300 rooms, including canteens, auditoriums, and classrooms, to store wheat. Wudou Commune's May Fourth Brigade encountered heavy rain during the harvest and immediately organized more than 350 people to rush to thresh and cover the wheat. After a day and night of fighting, 75 mu of wheat transported to the threshing ground was threshed, and the threshed wet wheat was dried indoors and blown with a windlass. The wettest wheat was baked with fire, and the 15 mu that had not been threshed were hung up with ropes to dry. The 250 mu of wheat stacks that were not covered with straw were also covered with more than three inches of wheat stalks.

    不怕连阴雨　自有巧安排
    肥西县实行九项措施力争新麦颗粒归仓
    新华社合肥13日电　中共安徽省肥西县委向全县人民提出的巧战阴雨力争颗粒归仓的九项措施，在麦收中起了很大作用。现在，全县四十八万多亩麦子已经割了四十多万亩，有将近三十万亩已经脱粒。
    这个县巧战阴雨的九项措施是：第一，与天斗智，见缝插针。下雨时栽秧，雨止时抢割。第二，分别轻重缓急。先割成熟早的、容易脱粒的品种，后割成熟迟的、不易脱粒的品种；先割湖滩、圩泊、沿河、畈田等低洼地区，后割岗地；先割栽秧田，后割播种旱作物田。第三，边收边运。收割后的麦子，要及时运到室内摊开晾着；运到场上的要堆好盖好。第四，千方百计设法脱粒。雨天不能打场，就在室内用斛桶打，防止霉烂。第五，脱过粒的潮麦，采取多种办法保管。如用烘、晾等办法减少水分。湿麦过多，食堂可按规定手续和口粮标准进行调剂，先吃湿粮，储存干粮。第六，以工换工，开展协作。抢收任务不大的生产队支援任务大的，保证把麦子全部收到手。第七，加强气象预报和抢收战斗力量，广泛发动机关干部、学校师生、工厂职工、居民等参加抢收。第八，加强细收细打教育，力争雨天抢收颗粒不丢。第九，社和队召开老农座谈会，多和群众商量，充分发挥群众智慧，研究多种多样抢收办法，作到颗粒归仓。
    全县广大人民群众热烈拥护这些措施，很快就掀起了一个群众性的巧战阴雨，奋夺丰收的抢收运动。5月28日当各地收到连日阴雨的气象预报后，立即紧急行动，抢收力量迅速增加到将近二十万人，经过一天顽强奋战，共割麦子十万零五千多亩。岗集公社看到满天乌云，要下大雨，立即抽调七十多干部划片包干，发动八千八百多人突击抢收抢运，并且腾出食堂、会堂、教室等一切可以利用的房子一千三百多间放麦。文斗公社五四大队在抢收中突遇大雨，立即组织三百五十多人抢打抢盖，经过一天一晚战斗，运到场上的麦子有七十五亩脱了粒，打下的湿麦在室内晾，用风车吹，最湿的用火烘，未脱粒的十五亩也都用绳吊起来晾，二百五十亩未盖草的麦垛，也盖上了三寸多厚的麦秆。
