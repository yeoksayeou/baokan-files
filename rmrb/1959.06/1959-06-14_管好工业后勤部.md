Manage the Industrial Logistics Department Well

	Sundries supply has greatly improved, with a complete variety of goods;
	All because of good industry and commerce cooperation, market supply is as stable as a mountain.

This is the comment from the staff of a retail unit in Tianjin to the Municipal Native Produce and Sundries Company. Judging from the supply situation of daily-use sundries in Tianjin, it is indeed the case. From January to mid-May this year, the supply of daily-use sundries in Tianjin increased by 1.2 times compared to the five months from August to December last year. In the market, except for individual varieties, people can buy the pots, bowls, ladles, basins, and other daily-use sundries they need at any time.

Why is the supply of daily-use sundries so abundant in the Tianjin market? To tell the truth, there is a process involved:

It was last winter. In order to welcome the New Year and the Spring Festival, the company's leaders specially organized many employees to study how to fully meet the supply of daily-use sundries. At that time, the employees in the company had different ideological understandings. Some employees believed: living depends on pots and bowls, daily necessities are a major matter, and must be properly arranged; some employees believed: people's purchasing power is growing too fast, and production can’t keep up with demand no matter how much it increases; some employees also believed: daily necessities are a minor matter, not as important as key construction, production cannot be prioritized, and even if you want to help, you can't. Most employees disagreed with these statements, believing: "It all depends on human effort, pies don’t fall from the sky, the question is whether you have tried everything possible and made the greatest effort." The company leaders promptly seized these different ideological understandings and launched a major debate, finally finding the correct direction—resolutely relying on the leadership of the Party, starting from organizing production, participating in production, organizing local sources of goods, and taking the mass line.

With the direction set, how to organize and mobilize production? At that time, there were only six handicraft cooperatives in the city, how could they meet the huge needs of Tianjin City with a population of more than four million? Therefore, the company's leaders mobilized the masses to conduct searches and surveys, and finally discovered thirty-one handicraft cooperatives and privately-run industries that had experience in producing daily-use sundries. The company immediately submitted a proposal to the relevant leading departments of the city for "production returning to the ranks," obtained the support of the leading organs, and organized production arrangements.

With the production force solved, how to organize the supply of raw materials? In order to allow production units to concentrate on production and reduce the burden of all other affairs, the company personally participated in production, assisted in production planning, and took the initiative to take on the task of solving the supply of raw materials, assigning specific personnel to take charge, and adopting methods of excavating, squeezing, substituting, saving, finding, requesting, and transferring. For example, iron is needed to produce iron kettles, so they contacted various parties and excavated more than 50 tons from the surplus materials from the production of stovepipes; to produce brooms that lacked seedlings, special personnel were sent to Shaanxi to find 310,000 jin; if they could not excavate or find them, they tried to find substitutes. For example, when producing wooden sundries, they consulted old business staff and purchased a batch of broken wooden boards from the Northeast based on past experience. In order to enable limited materials to play a greater role, the company's employees went deep into workshops and work teams to study methods of saving materials with the workers. For example, in the past, one sheet of iron could only produce seven coal briquette stoves, but after research and improvement of the cutting method, each sheet of iron could cut out one more stove, increasing production by 4,000 coal briquette stoves at once. In the process of solving these raw materials, the company not only managed to find them, but also managed to deliver them, even helping to find auxiliary raw materials in production. For example, they have successively found lead powder, firewood, and sugarcane for the pot casting factory, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and solder for the black and white iron production cooperative, and purchased tools—planes—for the woodworking production cooperative. Therefore, many production units said with emotion: "You are really our good logistics department."

Daily-use sundries are diverse, complex in specifications, and vary in value. There are drinking water boilers worth hundreds of yuan each, and there are also small commodities that are not worth even eight cents when ten are added together, and these small commodities are often indispensable in people's daily lives. In order to meet market needs, the company repeatedly studied with the industrial departments and made overall arrangements according to the type of work, so that the production of those small commodities that are easily overlooked, such as coal shovels and rice spoons, was also guaranteed.

With production developed, the supply problem is not difficult to solve. Now, the daily-use sundries produced in Tianjin can achieve self-sufficiency in terms of quantity and in most varieties, and can also provide a certain amount of support to other regions. In recent months, the support for Beijing alone has included more than 900,000 brooms and pot brushes, as well as many mops and pot racks.

    管好工业后勤部
    杂品供应大改观，品种花样真齐全；
    只因工商协作好，市场供应稳如山。
    这是天津市零售单位职工给市土产杂品公司的评语。从天津市日用杂品供应情况看，的确如此。今年1至5月中旬，天津市日用杂品的供应量比去年8至12月份五个月的供应量增加了一点二倍。在市场上，除个别品种外，人民可以随时买到自己需要的锅、碗、瓢、盆等日用杂品。
    为什么天津市场上的日用杂品供应会这样充足呢？说起来，这里面还有一段过程：
    那还是去年冬天的事。为了迎接新年和春节，这个公司的领导上曾专门组织了不少职工研究如何充分满足日用杂品的供应问题。当时公司里的职工思想认识是不一样的。有的职工认为：过日子离不开锅碗瓢盆，生活用品是件大事，必须妥善安排；有的职工认为：人民购买力增长得太快，生产怎么提高也赶不上需要；也有的职工认为：生活用品是件小事，怎么也不如重点建设重要，生产上排不上队，有劲也使不上。大部分职工不同意这些说法，认为：“事在人为，从天上掉不下馅饼来，问题是看你是不是想尽了一切办法，尽了最大的努力。”公司领导及时抓住了这几种不同的思想认识，展开了一场大辩论，终于找到了正确的方向——坚决依靠党的领导，从组织生产、参与生产、组织地方货源入手，走群众路线。
    方向是有了，如何组织发动生产呢？当时市里只有六户手工业社，又怎能适应四百多万人口的天津市的庞大需要呢？于是，这个公司的领导就发动群众进行寻访、摸底，终于发现了三十一户过去有生产日用杂品经验的手工业社和民办工业。于是公司立即向市的有关领导部门提出“生产归队”的建议，取得了领导机关的支持，组织安排了生产。
    生产力量解决了，可是如何组织原料的供应呢？这个公司为了让生产单位一心从事生产，减去一切其他事务的负担，就亲自参与生产，帮助进行生产规划，并主动把解决原料的供应任务担当起来，确定了专人包干，采取了挖、挤、代、省、找、要、调的方法。如生产铁壶需要铁，他们就与多方面联系，从生产烟筒的余料中挖出来五十多吨；生产条帚缺苗子，就派专人到陕西去找来三十一万斤；挖不到，找不见的就想办法找代用品。如生产木制杂品时，就请教老业务员，根据过去的经验，从东北购到一批碎木板。为了使有限的物料发挥更大的作用，这个公司的职工又深入车间、作坊与工人一块研究节省物料的办法。如过去一张铁皮只生产七个煤球炉子，经研究，改进了裁料方法，每张铁皮就可多裁出一个炉子，一下子就增产了四千个煤球炉子。在解决这些原料的过程中，公司不仅管找，还管送，甚至连生产中的辅助原料也帮助寻找。如他们曾先后为铸锅厂寻找到铅粉、劈柴、青蔗，为黑白铁生产社寻找盐酸、硫酸、焊锡，为木器生产社寻购工具——刨子等。因此，不少生产单位感动地说：“你们真是我们的好后勤部”。
    日用杂品种类繁多、规格复杂、价值不一。有价值数百元一个的饮水锅炉，也有十个加在一起也不值块八角的小商品，而这些小商品又往往是人们日常生活中缺它不可的。这个公司为了满足市场需要，和工业部门反复研究，按工种进行统筹安排，从而使那些容易被忽略的小商品，像煤铲、饭勺等的生产也都得到了保证。
    生产发展了，供应问题也就不难解决了。现在，天津市生产的日用杂品无论在数量上或在绝大部分品种上，都能做到自给自足，而且还能拿出一定数量来支援其他地区。最近几个月来，仅支援北京的条帚、炊帚就有九十多万把，此外还有不少墩布、锅篦等。
