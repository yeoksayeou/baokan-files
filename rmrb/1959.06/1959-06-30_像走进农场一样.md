    Like Walking into a Farm

    We, the staff and workers of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant, under the personal leadership of the plant director and Party committee secretary, have all opened up small vegetable gardens in front of and behind our houses. Now, when anyone walks into the workers' dormitory area, they see fresh green beans, vegetables, and radishes filling the gardens, with corn and sunflowers growing taller than the knees, just like walking into a farm.

    Utilizing spare land and time to grow vegetables has many benefits, such as being able to eat fresh vegetables, reducing difficulties in market supply, cultivating labor habits, and also being conducive to thrift.

    Fan Zhen, a worker in this plant, planted a few small plots of vegetables, and didn't buy any vegetables at all last year. Calculating that he saved two cents a day, he saved more than seventy yuan for the whole year, which is beneficial to the country and to himself.

    像走进农场一样
    我们下花园电厂职工，在厂长、党委书记亲自带动下，家家户户房前屋后都开辟了小菜园。现在谁走进职工宿舍区，就看到鲜豆角、青菜、萝卜已经满园，玉米和向日葵长过膝盖，就像走进农场一样。
    利用零星地和工余种菜，有许多好处，如能吃上新鲜蔬菜；可减少市场供应困难；培养了劳动习惯；还有利于勤俭持家。
    这个厂有个工人范祯，种了几小块地的菜，去年一年没有买过蔬菜，按一天节约二角钱计算，全年节省了七十多元，对国家、对自己都有好处。
