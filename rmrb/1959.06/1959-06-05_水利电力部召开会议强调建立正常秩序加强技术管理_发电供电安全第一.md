Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 4th—The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power recently convened a national meeting in Luoyang to exchange experiences in the production of thermal power plants, calling on thermal power plant workers across the country to vigorously launch the movement for increasing production and practicing economy, to provide more sufficient power for this year's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

The meeting proposed that in the movement to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to strengthen the ideology of safe production, so that every worker recognizes that safe power generation and supply is a major matter concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood. The meeting pointed out that this year's development scale of the power industry is very large, and the newly added installed capacity of thermal power plants will have a greater increase than last year, among which the capacity of several units will reach 100,000 kilowatts; about 70% of the operators this year are novices, who need to go through a period of learning to master modern power industry production technology. These situations have put forward higher requirements for the safe production of the power industry this year. Therefore, leading cadres of each power plant must further go deep into reality, conscientiously rely on the masses to do a good job in technical management and personnel training, establish and improve various responsibility systems and operating procedures, do a good job in equipment maintenance and regular maintenance, avoid and reduce various accidents, and ensure safe production.

The meeting introduced the experience of the boiler workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant in safe operation for four years and four months. On the basis of safe production, the equipment utilization rate of this plant has also been improved. In recent years, this plant has continuously strengthened the education of safe production for employees through various movements, so that the concept of "production must be safe, and safety is for production" is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Leading cadres at all levels of the factory have gone deep into the workshop to participate in labor, and formed inspection teams with technicians and workers to plant experimental fields and solve key technical problems, effectively strengthening technical management, and revised the operation system and maintenance management system. In order to help workers smoothly master new machines, the factory dispatched boiler operators and assistants with strong working abilities to other factories to learn as early as possible; general apprentices were taken care of by special personnel, and methods combining theory and practice were adopted to help them quickly improve their professional and technical level. At present, most of the new workers can operate independently, and some young workers have also taken up jobs as boiler operators, deputy boiler operators, and assistants. The meeting also introduced the experience of Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant in doing a good job in technical management and rapid maintenance, the experience of Tianjin No. 3 Power Plant in combining leadership and the masses to ensure safe production, and the experiences of power plants in Shijiazhuang, Fuxin, Tangshan, Luoyang and other places in technical revolution and worker training.

The meeting emphasized that when grasping technical management, power plants in various places must first do a good job in the work of "people" so that everyone can consciously abide by labor discipline and rules and regulations. The meeting required all units to take different measures according to their different circumstances. Units with sound technical management systems, such as Shijingshan, Fushun, Shanghai Yangshupu, Fuxin and other power plants, should take another step forward; units with basically sound technical management systems that are currently somewhat relaxed should consolidate and consolidate; units with poor technical management and incomplete systems should start by restoring and establishing the normal order of production and strengthen technical management.

The meeting also studied improving the operation and management of various power plants. It required all units to strive to complete the state's power generation plan, tap equipment potential, improve operating methods, vigorously save materials, in order to increase labor productivity and reduce production costs.

Attending the meeting were leaders of the National Power Industry Trade Union, and a total of 350 people including party committee secretaries, factory directors, technical cadres, and advanced producers from 159 power plants in various provinces and cities.

    水利电力部召开会议强调建立正常秩序加强技术管理
    发电供电安全第一
    新华社洛阳4日电　水利电力部最近在洛阳召集全国火力发电厂生产经验交流会议，号召全国火电厂职工大力开展增产节约运动，为今年工农业生产大跃进提供更加充足的动力。
    会议提出，在增产节约运动中必须加强安全生产的思想，使每一个职工都认识到安全发电供电是关系到国计民生的大事。会议指出，今年电力工业发展规模很大，火电厂新增加的装机容量将比去年有更大的增长，其中有几台机组的容量将达到十万瓩；今年有70％左右的运行人员是新手，需要经过一个时期的学习，才能掌握近代化电业生产技术。这些情况，都对今年电力工业的安全生产提出了更高的要求。因此，各电厂的领导干部必须进一步深入实际，切实依靠群众搞好技术管理和人员培训工作，建立和健全各种责任制和操作规程，作好设备的维护和定期检修，避免和减少各种事故，保证安全生产。
    会议介绍了石景山发电厂锅炉车间四年零四个月安全运行的经验。这个厂在安全生产的基础上，设备利用率也有所提高。几年来，这个厂通过各种运动不断对职工加强了安全生产的教育，使“生产必须安全，安全为了生产”的观念深入人心。工厂各级领导干部，都深入工段参加劳动，同技术人员和工人组成检查队，种试验田，解决技术关键问题，有效地加强了技术管理工作，并且修订了运行制度和检修管理制度。为了帮助工人顺利地掌握新机器，工厂及早抽调了工作能力较强的司炉及助手到外厂学习；一般徒工由专人负责，采取理论和实践相结合的方法，帮助他们迅速提高业务技术水平。目前绝大部分新工人都能独立操作，有一部分青工还担任了司炉、副司炉、助手等工作。会议也介绍了上海杨树浦发电厂搞好技术管理和快速检修的经验，天津第三发电厂领导和群众相结合保证安全生产的经验，以及石家庄、阜新、唐山、洛阳等地电厂有关技术革命、培训工人等方面的经验。
    会议强调指出：各地电厂在抓技术管理的时候，首先要做好“人”的工作，使人人都能自觉地遵守劳动纪律与规章制度。会议要求各单位根据自己不同的情况采取不同的措施。凡是技术管理制度健全的单位，如石景山、抚顺、上海杨树浦、阜新等电厂，要再提高一步；技术管理制度基本健全，目前有些放松的单位，要整顿巩固；技术管理工作较差、制度不够健全的单位，要从恢复、建立生产的正常秩序着手，加强技术管理工作。
    会议对改善各电厂的经营管理也作了研究。要求各单位努力完成国家的发电计划，挖掘设备潜力，改进操作方法，大力节约材料，以提高劳动生产率，降低生产成本。
    出席这次会议的有全国电力工业工会的负责人，来自各省市一百五十九个发电厂的党委书记、厂长、技术干部、先进生产者共三百五十人。
