Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 20th: The "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of more than 130 Japanese organizations, decided yesterday to hold a large-scale rally and demonstration in Tokyo on June 25 to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

June 25 is the third national unified action day for the Japanese people to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." As this day approaches and the pace of the Kishida Nobusuke government's revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" accelerates, the movement of people from all walks of life in Japan against the revision of this treaty is rapidly expanding and rising.

The working class stands at the forefront of the struggle. The Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, the All Japan Harbor Workers' Union, the National Metal Workers' Union, the National Printing and Publishing Industry Workers' Union Federation, the Chemical Industry Workers' Union League, and the Government and Public Office Workers' Union Council and many other unions have recently decided to hold strikes or rallies on the 25th to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The Teachers' Union, the All Japan Free Labor Union, the Japan Iron and Steel Industry Workers' Union Federation, the All-Resident Military Workers' Union, and the All Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union also adopted a fighting policy to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" at recent conferences.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Teachers' Union held a meeting on the 17th with a thousand teachers participating, focusing on discussing the fighting policy against the revision of the "Security Treaty." This union also distributed 300,000 leaflets on the streets of Tokyo today and yesterday, calling on citizens to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The All Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation has also decided to mobilize its members to hold strikes nationwide.

The joint struggle organizations in various prefectures across the country to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" have also decided to actively participate in the unified action on the 25th and have begun large-scale propaganda activities.

The movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty" is also developing rapidly in academic circles, cultural circles, women's circles, and business and industry circles. Renowned scholars and cultural figures such as former University of Tokyo President Nanbara Shigeru issued a statement on May 29 calling on cultural figures to rise up against the revision of the "Security Treaty," which has been endorsed by an increasing number of cultural figures. As of now, more than 420 cultural figures have expressed their support for this statement.

The Women's Democratic Club decided at its conference on June 6 and 7 to widely launch propaganda activities to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Due to the initiative of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry Organizations, joint organizations to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty" are also being brewing within various industries of small and medium-sized enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 22nd: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a call on the 21st to all levels of party organizations and all party members to immediately launch activities to strive for the successful holding of the third national unified action day on June 25 to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that the most reactionary Kishida Nobusuke cabinet is plotting to quickly end the negotiations on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and is preparing to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet to approve the revised "Security Treaty." In this situation, the upcoming "June 25" unified action is of great significance. Therefore, all party members of the Japanese Communist Party must hold meetings and formulate guidelines in order to play a leading role in the unified action.

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party requires party organizations and party members at all levels to carry out the following activities: distribute the resolution passed by the National Representative Conference held by the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" on the 16th to people from all walks of life and various groups; mobilize the masses to launch activities against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on "June 25"; actively organize joint struggle organizations in all cities, towns, and villages; expose the essence of the San Francisco Peace Treaty system to workers and other masses, combine the struggle to promote the prevention and striving for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" with the people's various daily struggles, and strive to expand the strength of the party in these struggles.

The "Akahata" newspaper also published an editorial today, calling on all party members to strive for the successful holding of the "June 25" unified action and to continue to fight for the fourth and fifth unified actions.

    6月25日是日本人民阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”第三次全国统一行动日。随着这个日子的临近和岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的步调的加紧，日本各界人民反对修改这个条约的运动正在迅速扩展，日益高涨。

    日共中央要求党的各级组织和党员展开下列活动：向各阶层人民和各界团体散发“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”在16日举行的全国代表会议上通过的决议；发动群众在“六·二五”展开反对日美“安全条约”的活动；在所有的市、町、村积极组织共同斗争组织；向工人和其他群众揭露旧金山和约体系的本质，把促使阻止和争取废除“安全条约”的斗争同人民的各种日常斗争结合起来，在这些斗争中努力扩大党的力量。
    “赤旗报”今天也发表社论，号召全体党员为争取胜利举行“六·二五”统一行动，并且为继续举行第四次和第五次统一行动而奋斗。
