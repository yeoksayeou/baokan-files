The June issue of "Film Creation" published a set of materials about the film "The New Year's Sacrifice": Lu Xun's original novel, Xia Yan's film literary script, Sang Hu's film director's script, as well as film reviews and the adapter's postscript. This approach by the editorial department is good, as it allows readers to explore the process of artistic creation that shaped this film, thereby gaining some knowledge of adapting literary works into films and learning some experience in artistic creation. For general readers, it can also increase interest and understanding of this film, and improve the ability to appreciate movies.
"The New Year's Sacrifice" is an excellent feature film, welcomed by audiences at home and abroad, and commensurate with the original novel. Of course, the film lacks a certain charm inherent in the novel due to the use of the first-person narrative method. In the novel, the original author displays his inner self and makes arguments, and the lyrical monologues give people deep feelings and enlightenment. In the movie, one had to reluctantly give that up. However, thanks to the excellent creation of the adapter and director, the spirit of the original work is still preserved, and in terms of plot and thought, the film feels richer than the novel.
Readers may wish to compare the three scripts and study the ingenuity of the film adapter and director in their additions. In this regard, Zhang Shu's "Study Notes on 'The New Year's Sacrifice'" in this issue of "Film Creation" provides a lot of analysis, and it is an article worth reading.
"The New Year's Sacrifice" is about to be re-screened, and it is very interesting to read this issue of "Film Creation" before re-watching the film. (Fu He)

    一部电影脚本的产生
    6月号的“电影创作”登了一套关于电影“祝福”的材料：鲁迅的小说原作、夏衍的电影文学剧本、桑弧的电影导演台本，以及影评和改编者的后记等。编辑部的这种处理，是好的，这使读者得以寻味这部电影在艺术创作上形成的过程，从而获得一些改编文学作品为电影的知识，学习一些艺术创作上的经验。对一般读者说来，也可以增加对这部片子的兴趣和理解，把欣赏电影的能力提高一步。
    “祝福”是一部优秀的故事片，受到国内外观众的欢迎，跟小说原作是相称的。固然，电影缺少了小说所具有的、由于采用第一人称的叙述方法而带来的某种韵味。在小说中，原作者展示自己内心并发议论，那些抒情的独白所给人的感受和启发，是很深的。在电影中，不得不割爱了。但是，由于改编者和导演的卓越的创造，原作的精神还是保留了，而在情节上，也在思想上，使人觉得电影比小说有所丰富。
    读者不妨把三个本子作一些比较，研究一下电影改编者和导演的独出心裁的增益。在这一方面，这期“电影创作”中所载章抒的一篇“‘祝福’学习扎记”作了不少分析，这是一篇值得一读的文章。
    “祝福”就要重新放映了，在重看片子前，读一下这一期的“电影创作”是很有意思的。（符何）
