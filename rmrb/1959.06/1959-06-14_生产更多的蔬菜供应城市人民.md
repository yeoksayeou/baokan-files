    Produce More Vegetables to Supply Urban Residents

    Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Further Strengthening Vegetable Production and Supply Work" last December, especially after clearly stipulating that suburban areas of cities should focus on vegetable production recently, Party committees in various regions have strengthened their leadership over vegetable production in suburban areas. In the past six months, especially in the past month, vegetable production has greatly developed. According to statistics from ten cities including Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, the amount of vegetables on the market from January to May this year has increased compared to the same period in the past. Some cities in the south have already achieved a situation where each person can eat one jin (0.5 kg) of vegetables per day.

    After liberation, the development speed of vegetable production has been very fast, and the increase in vegetable supply has also been very fast. Taking Beijing as an example, in 1949, the average person ate about four liang (200g) of vegetables per day, which increased to about half a jin (250g) in 1951, a little more than twelve liang (600g) in 1957, and thirteen liang (650g) in 1958. This means that in the past ten years, with the continuous increase of the urban population, the average vegetable supply per person per day has still increased more than doubled. This is a very big thing.

    However, with the continued growth of urban and industrial and mining areas' populations and the continuous improvement of consumption levels, it is still necessary to further develop vegetable production in order to meet people's needs. To develop vegetable production, we must first actively expand the planting area. Since last year, the urban areas of many large and medium-sized cities have expanded a lot, and some large cities even include about ten counties, so it is entirely possible to expand the vegetable planting area. As mentioned in this newspaper's editorial on May 30, "Vigorously Increase Vegetable Production": the agricultural production in the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities should focus on vegetables. If grain, cotton, and vegetable crops can be taken care of at the same time, of course, they can be taken care of simultaneously; if they cannot be taken care of simultaneously, the development of vegetable production must be guaranteed first. Because only by adopting this policy can each city achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables. As for the issue of food grain for vegetable-growing areas, it can be supplied by more distant urban areas, and if it is still not self-sufficient, the state will transfer grain from other places to supply it. Only by implementing the production policy of focusing on vegetables in suburban areas and striving for self-sufficiency can the vegetable supply problem for urban workers and residents be solved.

    After the vegetable planting area is expanded, in order to grow vegetables well, a batch of labor force needs to be increased accordingly. In areas where only one season of vegetables is grown and mostly coarse vegetables are grown, a vegetable farmer can cultivate and manage seven or eight mu (approximately 0.47-0.53 hectares) of vegetable fields; in places where the number of replanting is relatively high and the management is relatively meticulous, a vegetable farmer cannot manage so many vegetable fields. Judging from the national situation, the latter situation is more common. How to solve the shortage of cultivation management personnel? The method is to try every possible means to squeeze out labor from all aspects. A part of the labor force can be squeezed out from the urban streets; but the most fundamental way is to squeeze it out from the various undertakings run by the communes. Now the communes have set up many factories, some of which are needed for agricultural production (such as the initial processing of agricultural products and the repair and assembly of farm tools, etc.), and some are not directly serving agricultural production. These factories can be stopped or temporarily suspended, so that a considerable part of the labor force can be drawn to agricultural production. In addition, the voluntary labor of urban organizations, staff, students, and street residents should also be arranged as much as possible in vegetable planting. Reforming tools and improving labor efficiency is also an effective way to solve the labor force problem.

    Growing vegetables requires a set of specialized techniques. It is often seen that in the same climate, the same variety, and the same material conditions, the harvest is very large under the cultivation and management of a vegetable farmer with higher skills; under the cultivation and management of a person with low skills, the harvest is very small. The level of vegetable growing skills has become an important issue here. In order to solve the vegetable growing technology problem, the leading organs must take various measures to quickly allow people without technology to learn technology and master technology. For example, inviting experienced vegetable farmers to teach everyone the technology, running short-term training classes, explaining vegetable growing technology, etc. are all feasible methods.

    Vegetable production requires certain equipment, such as glass, crop straw, and chemical fertilizers. After the planting area is expanded, the demand for equipment also increases accordingly. Therefore, relevant departments must first take care of vegetable production when uniformly distributing these equipment. For people's communes and production teams themselves, they should first solve some equipment problems by using local materials, internal adjustment, and self-reliance.

    While solving the problem of vegetable quantity, we must also pay attention to solving the problem of vegetable varieties. According to habits, urban people have multifaceted needs for vegetables, so vegetables must also be diverse. We should not only strive to increase the production of bulk vegetables, but also try to take care of other small-volume varieties to meet the different preferences of urban people.

    The seasonality of vegetable production and the regularity of supply is a major contradiction. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the policy of supplementing slack seasons with peak seasons to solve the year-round supply of vegetables well. The so-called year-round supply does not mean that the supply of vegetables in the off-season and the peak season is the same amount, which is impossible. Supply a little more in the peak season, a little less in the off-season; supply a little more fresh vegetables in the peak season, and a little more dried and pickled vegetables in the off-season. In many places, especially in the north, it is impossible to produce vegetables as usual in winter unless many greenhouses are built. However, it is not possible to expand many greenhouses at present. So what should we do? The method is to seize the summer and autumn seasons to produce enough vegetables for urban people to eat throughout the year. At present, special attention should be paid to grasping the field management of summer vegetables and the arrangement of autumn vegetable production. Some varieties of summer vegetables, such as melons, tomatoes, and peppers, are the main raw materials for the vegetable processing industry. Cabbage and radish in autumn vegetables are even more important vegetables for storage in winter. The success or failure of these two seasons of vegetable production not only affects the issue of eating vegetables in the peak season, but also affects the supply in the off-season. In order to prepare for the vegetable supply in the off-season, in addition to commercial departments pickling some dried and pickled vegetables in the peak season, urban residents should also be mobilized to pickle some pickled and dried vegetables. Ensuring the supply of vegetables is not only a matter for vegetable farmers, but also a matter for urban residents. Urban residents should not only pickle some pickled dried vegetables in the peak season; but also support vegetable production in the suburbs in many ways, such as regularly drawing a part of the people to support vegetable production, accumulating a part of fertilizer for suburban communes, and so on.

    Finally, let's talk about the transportation and sales of vegetables. Solving the vegetable production problem is not the same as doing a good job in the entire vegetable supply work. Producing vegetables only solves half of the supply problem, and the other half of the work is to send the vegetables to the consumers. Especially in big cities, if the transportation and sales work is not done well, the vegetable supply plan will fail. Transportation and sales is also a very arduous task. Taking a city with a population of one million as an example, one million jin (500 tons) of vegetables must be supplied every day. If transported by trucks, it will take two hundred trips; if each vegetable salesperson supplies three to four hundred people and each vegetable stall supplies three to four hundred households, it will require about three thousand vegetable salespersons and about seven hundred supply points. If such a transportation and sales force is not well organized, there will be a phenomenon of vegetable accumulation and rotting in the suburbs or vegetable stations, while consumers feel that the supply is insufficient. In the current situation of insufficient labor, animal power, and tools, we must also think of ways to solve this problem in many ways. In terms of transportation, in addition to adding some transportation forces as much as possible, we can organize communes, collective catering units, and use other returning empty vehicles for transportation, or we can organize communes and collective catering units to link up and directly pick up and deliver. This not only reduces links, but also ensures that the vegetables are fresh and tender. In terms of sales, some supply points should be restored, some mobile vegetable sales vehicles should be added, and commercial personnel who have transferred their jobs in the past to operate vegetables should return to the team. In addition, methods such as resale by other non-staple food stores and organizing residents to distribute vegetables should also be adopted to solve the problem. In short, production, transportation, and sales must be closely combined to deliver vegetables to consumers quickly, well, and in large quantities.

### 生产更多的蔬菜供应城市人民

    生产更多的蔬菜供应城市人民
    自从去年12月中共中央、国务院发出“关于进一步加强蔬菜生产和供应工作的指示”，特别是最近明确规定了城市近郊以生产蔬菜为主的方针以后，各地党委都加强了对近郊区蔬菜生产的领导。半年来，特别是近一个月来，蔬菜生产有了很大的发展。据北京、上海、武汉等十个城市的统计，今年1月份到5月份的蔬菜上市量，都比过去同期有所增加。南方一些城市已经做到每人每天可以吃到一斤蔬菜。
    解放以后，蔬菜生产的发展速度很快，蔬菜供应量的增加也很快。以北京为例，1949年每人每天平均吃菜四两左右，1951年提高到半斤左右，1957年为十二两多一点，1958年为十三两。这就是说，十年来，在城市人口不断增加的情况下，每人每天平均蔬菜供应量还是增加了两倍以上。这是一件很大的事情。
    但是，随着城市和工矿区人口的继续增长和消费水平的不断提高，还必须更进一步地发展蔬菜生产，才能满足人们的需要。发展蔬菜生产，首先要积极扩大种植面积。去年以来，许多大中城市的市区已经扩大了许多，有些大城市还包括了十个左右的县，扩大蔬菜种植面积是完全可能的。本报在5月30日“大力增产蔬菜”的社论中已经谈到过：各大、中城市的近郊区的农业生产应该以蔬菜为主，如果粮、棉、菜各种作物能够同时兼顾的，当然可以同时兼顾；如果不能同时兼顾，必须首先保证蔬菜生产的发展。因为只有采取这个方针，各个城市才能做到蔬菜自给。至于菜区的吃粮问题，可以由较远的市区供应，如果仍然不能自给，则由国家从外地调粮供应。只有贯彻近郊区以蔬菜为主的生产方针，力争自给，城市职工居民的蔬菜供应问题才能解决。
    蔬菜栽种面积扩大以后，为了把菜种好，要相应地增加一批劳动力。在只种一季蔬菜而且粗菜居多的地区，一个菜农可以栽培管理七、八亩菜田；在复种次数比较多，管理又比较精细的地方，一个菜农就无法管理这么多菜田了。从全国情况来看，后一种情况居多。怎样解决栽培管理人员的不足呢？办法是千方百计地从各方面挤出劳动力。可以从城市街道中挤出一部分劳力来；但是最根本的办法，还是从公社举办的各项事业中去挤。现在公社办了不少工厂，有一部分工厂是为农业生产需要的（例如农产品的初步加工和农具修配等），也有一部分并不直接为农业生产服务，这部分工厂可以不办，或暂时停办，这样就可以抽出相当大一部分劳力到农业生产中去。此外，城市机关、工作人员、学校学生、街道居民的义务劳动，也要尽量安排到栽种蔬菜方面。改革工具，提高劳动效率，也是行之有效的解决劳动力的办法之一。
    种菜需要有一套专门技术。常常可以看到这样的事情：同样的气候，同样的品种，同样的物质条件，在一个技术较高的菜农栽培管理下，收获量很大；在一个技术不高的人栽培管理下，收获量很小。种菜技术的高低，在这里成了重要问题。为了解决种菜技术问题，领导机关就要采取各种措施，很快地让没有技术的人学到技术，掌握技术。比如请富有经验的菜农向大家传授技术，开办短期训练班，讲解种菜技术，等等，都是可行的办法。
    蔬菜生产需要一定的器材设备。如玻璃、作物秸秆和化学肥料。扩大种植面积以后，器材设备需要量也相应地增加。因此，有关部门在统一分配这些器材设备时，首先要照顾蔬菜生产。在人民公社和生产队本身来说，首先应当就地取材、内部调剂，自力更生地解决一些器材问题。
    在解决蔬菜数量问题的同时，还必须注意解决蔬菜品种的问题。城市人民按照习惯，对蔬菜的需要是多方面的，因而蔬菜也必须多种多样，对于大宗的蔬菜固然要努力增产，对于其他小量的品种也应尽量照顾，以满足城市人民不同的嗜好。
    蔬菜生产的季节性和供应的经常性是一个很大的矛盾，因此，必需贯彻以旺补淡的方针，才能很好地解决蔬菜的常年供应。所谓常年供应，并不是说淡季和旺季供应一样多的蔬菜，这是不可能的。旺季多供应一点，淡季少供应一点；旺季多供应一点鲜菜，淡季多供应一点干菜、咸菜。许多地方，特别是北方，到了冬季，除非建立很多的暖房，否则是无法在冬季照常生产蔬菜的。可是目前扩建很多的暖房又不可能。那么怎么办呢？办法就是抓紧夏秋两季，生产出足够城市人民全年食用的蔬菜。目前特别要注意抓住夏菜田间管理和秋菜生产的安排工作。夏菜中的一些品种如瓜类、番茄、辣椒等，是蔬菜加工工业的主要原料。秋菜中的白菜、萝卜更是储备过冬的大宗菜蔬。这两季蔬菜生产的好坏，不仅关系到旺季的吃菜问题，而且影响淡季的供应。为了准备淡季的蔬菜供应，除了商业部门在旺季腌制一些干菜和咸菜外，还要发动城市居民也要腌制一些咸菜和干菜。保证蔬菜的供应，不仅仅是菜农的事情，也是城市居民的事情。城市居民不仅要在旺季腌制一些咸菜干菜；而且要从多方面来支援近郊区的蔬菜生产，例如经常抽一部分人去支援蔬菜生产，为近郊区公社积集一部分肥料，等等。
    最后，谈一谈蔬菜的运和销的问题。解决了蔬菜的生产问题，还不等于作好了全部蔬菜供应工作。生产蔬菜只是解决了供应问题的一半，还有一半工作是把蔬菜送到消费者的手中去。特别在大城市，运销工作做不好，蔬菜的供应计划便要落空。运销工作也是一件十分艰巨的工作。以一个一百万人口的城市来说，每天就要供应一百万斤蔬菜，用汽车运输，就要二百辆次；以每一售菜人员供应三、四百人，每一售菜点供应三、四百户计算，就需要售菜人员三千人左右，供应点七百个左右。这样的运输和销售力量要是组织不好，就会发生郊区或是菜站蔬菜堆积黄烂，而消费者则感到供应不足的现象。在目前劳力、畜力、工具不足的情况下，解决这个问题也必须多方面想办法。在运输方面，除尽可能增添一些运输力量外，可以组织公社、集体伙食单位以及利用其他回空车辆运送，也可以组织公社和集体伙食单位挂钩，直接取送。这样既减少环节，又保证蔬菜鲜嫩。在销售方面，应当恢复一些供应点，增加一些流动售菜车，已经转了业的过去经营蔬菜的商业人员，应当归队。此外，还应当采用由其他副食品商店代销和组织居民分菜的办法来解决。总之，产、运、销必须密切结合，才能把蔬菜又多又快又好地送到消费者的手里。
