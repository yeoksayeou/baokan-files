Philosophy Research, Issue 5, published Jin Yuelin's article "Self-Criticism of the Old Book 'Logic'." "Logic" is a textbook written by Comrade Jin Yuelin before liberation, which was listed as a "University Series" at that time, widely circulated, and had a certain influence. In this article, the author made a serious self-criticism of this book.

The author said that in the past, he was deeply influenced by bourgeois logicians such as Russell and Dewey, and engaging in formal logic was to serve idealist worldviews and epistemology. The guiding ideology of the book "Logic" is to metaphysicize formal logic, making it detached from specific times, places, and conditions, becoming a purely abstract formula, so that it does not play or plays little of its inherent helping role in the specific process of thinking and cognition.

The author uses examples to illustrate that under specific times, places, and conditions, the objective事物 (things) we study determine a range, and "yes or no" is limited by that range. Beyond that range, saying "yes" has no meaning, and saying "no" has no meaning. Objective事物 (things) are different at different times, different places, and different conditions. In this case, abstract formulas also have different specific contents, so they are flexible. The author said, I wanted to kill it. This is the requirement of bourgeois philosophy, especially the requirement of objective idealists. Perhaps some people find this strange. In the past year or more, we have often presented facts and reasoned, and when reasoning, we were afraid of not being alive; before liberation, when I engaged in philosophy, I was afraid of not being dead.

When talking about the concept issue, the author wrote: The book "Logic" I wrote does not talk about concepts at all. At that time, I regarded formal logic as simply studying the "necessary" relationship between propositions, and at that time I thought that concepts did not have this "necessity." This idea itself is absurd. I don't think concepts have truth or falsehood. This is also wrong. Concepts are the reflection of the essential attributes of objective事物 (things) in our minds. To cancel the truth or falsehood of concepts is to deny that concepts are a form of thinking that reflects objective事物 (things), that is, to cancel its role in thinking, that is, to oppose the theory of reflection of dialectical materialism.

Next, the author criticized the proposition aspect. The author said that according to my understanding at the time, a proposition is the content of thought that is separated from specific conditions and connections. Under such an understanding, propositions and judgments become different things. Propositions are separated from judgments, and also separated from specific times, places, and other historical conditions, becoming suspended things.

Separated from specific conditions, the difference between propositions that are not restricted by these conditions and serious, responsible judgments is very large. As far as responsible judgments are concerned, the main problem, the central problem, is the authenticity and correctness of the judgment. Formal logic is to help us achieve this authenticity and correctness. The situation of propositions that are separated from specific conditions and suspended is completely different. It gives idealism the opportunity to raise questions at will. In the book "Logic," I do not talk about judgments but about propositions, precisely to remove the constraints of specific conditions, precisely to make propositions a place for conceptual games.

In the section "Criticism of the Inference Part," Comrade Jin Yuelin touched on the issues of debate in the logic community in recent years, namely the issues of formal correctness vs. substantive truth, and the class nature of logic. The author said that the poison I used to spread was to separate formal correctness from substantive truth. There is a distinction between the two. However, distinction is one thing, and separation or division is another. Correctness has always been the combination of substantive truth and formal correctness.

First, let's talk about inference. The correctness of inference has always included the truthfulness of its components. The entire inference is a specific thinking content in the concrete process of thinking and cognition, it is itself a cognition, and also a judgment. The judger must responsibly recognize the premises, and affirm their truthfulness, before being able to transition to the conclusion. In the responsible process of thinking and cognition, the judger cannot infer from false propositions.

The author believes that whether formal logic has a class nature is still a matter that should be specifically studied. The author feels that the speech of the people in socialist countries, especially formal documents, are logically strong, while the speech in capitalist countries generally has no logic. The author continued: Judgment is serious and responsible. However, as far as we are concerned, what other meaning is there in being serious and responsible besides adhering to the working-class stand? I think there is no other meaning.

The original book did not have an induction part. Jin Yuelin believes that this obviously involves academic and ideological issues. He said that in class, I often put forward such a statement: logic is the study of the necessary relationship between propositions. I regard the entire logic as the study of necessary science, and necessity is the kind of necessity mentioned in the original book. Using such a standard to measure, induction is excluded from the scope of logic. The correct view should be to admit the relativity and contingency of necessity. Necessity relative to time, place, and conditions is concrete necessity, which contains the possibility of concrete reality. Such necessity is on the one hand relative to the scientific level we have reached at a certain time and place, and on the other hand relative to the objective laws under specific conditions. Necessity under such a view is a reflection of the necessity of objective事物 (things). Such necessity is living necessity, not dead, it is dialectical necessity, not metaphysical necessity. What excludes induction is not scientific necessity, but metaphysical necessity.

The author believes that excluding induction from the scope of formal logic has academic and ideological support, which is actually the manifestation of Berkeley, Hume, and Mach's philosophy in the "theory" of formal logic. The author deeply realizes that his deep-rooted metaphysical way of thinking is inseparable from the separation of theory from practice.

Finally, the author believes that his self-criticism did not raise the issue of the objective basis of formal logic, which is a fundamental shortcoming. This will be left for future补上 (make up). The author hopes that old colleagues and young people can participate in this criticism.

### 金岳霖撰文  对旧著“逻辑”进行自我批判

    金岳霖撰文
    对旧著“逻辑”进行自我批判
    哲学研究第五期刊载了金岳霖的“对旧著‘逻辑’一书的自我批判”一文。“逻辑”是金岳霖同志解放前写的一本教科书，被列为当时的“大学丛书”，流传较广，起过一定的影响。作者在本文中对这本书进行了严肃的自我批判。
    作者说，他过去深受资产阶级逻辑学家罗素、杜威等人的影响，搞形式逻辑是为唯心主义世界观和认识论服务。“逻辑”一书的指导思想就是把形式逻辑形而上学化，使它脱离具体的时间、地点和条件，成为纯粹的抽象公式，使它在具体的思惟认识过程中不起或者少起它所固有的帮助作用。
    作者用实例说明，在具体的时间、地点和条件之下，我们所研究的客观事物决定了一个范围，“是或不是”是受那个范围的限制的，超出那个范围，说“是”没有意义，说“不是”也没有意义。客观事物在不同的时间，不同的地点和不同的条件下是不同的，在这种情况下的抽象公式也是有不同的具体内容的，因此，它是灵活的。作者说，我要求把它搞死。这是资产阶级哲学的要求，特别是客观唯心论者的要求。也许有人觉得这是奇怪的。在过去一年以上的时间里，我们经常在摆事实讲道理，而讲道理的时候，唯恐不活；在解放前，我搞哲学唯恐不死。
    谈到概念问题时，作者写道：我写的“逻辑”一书根本不谈概念。我当时是把形式逻辑看作单纯地研究命题与命题之间的“必然”的关系的，而那时我认为概念没有这种“必然”性。这个想法本身是荒谬的。我认为概念没有真假。这也是错误的。概念是客观事物底本质属性在我们头脑中的反映。把概念的真假取消，就是否认概念是反映客观事物的思维形式，就是取消它在思维中的作用，也就是反对辩证唯物主义的反映论。
    接着，作者就命题方面进行了批判。作者说，照我当时的了解，命题就是脱离了具体条件联系的思维内容。在这样的了解下，命题和判断就成为不同的东西了。命题脱离了判断，也就脱离了具体的时间、地点和别的历史条件，成为悬空的东西。
    脱离了具体的条件，不受这些条件制约的命题和严肃的认真负责的判断的分别就非常之大。就认真负责的判断说，主要的问题、中心的问题是判断的真实性、正确性。形式逻辑是帮助我们达到这个真实性、正确性的。脱离了具体的条件悬空了的命题底情况就完全两样了。它给唯心主义以随心所欲地提出问题的机会。我在“逻辑”那本书里不谈判断而谈命题，正是要解除具体条件的制约，正是要使命题成为概念游戏的场所。
    在“关于推论部分的批判”这一部分中，金岳霖同志涉及到了近年来逻辑界的争论问题，即真假对错的问题和逻辑的阶级性问题。作者说，我从前所散布的毒素是把形式上的对错和实质上的真假分家。这二者是有分别的。但是，分别是一件事，分割或分家是另外一件事。正确性一直就是实质上的真和形式上的对结合着的。
    先谈谈推论。推论的正确性一直就是包含它的组成部分的真实性的。整个的推论是具体的思维认识过程中的具体的思维内容，它本身是一个认识，也是一个判断。判断者非得认真负责地认识前提，断定了它们的真实性，才能够过渡到结论上去。在认真负责的思维认识过程中，判断者是不能够从假的命题来进行推论的。
    作者认为，形式逻辑有没有阶级性，还是应该具体地研究的问题。作者感觉到社会主义国家人民的言论，特别是正式的文件都是逻辑性强的，资本主义国家里的言论大都没有什么逻辑性。作者继续说：判断是严肃的、认真负责的。但是，就我们说，所谓严肃、所谓认真负责，除了坚持工人阶级立场之外还有什么意义呢？我认为是没有别的意义的。
    原书是没有归纳那一部分的。金岳霖认为这显然就有学术思想问题。他说，在课堂上我经常提出这样一个说法：逻辑是研究命题与命题之间的必然关系的。我把整个的逻辑看作是研究必然的科学，而必然又是原书所说的那种必然。用这样一个标准来衡量，归纳就被排除到逻辑范围之外去了。正确的看法应该是承认必然的相对性、有对性。相对于时间、地点、条件的必然是具体的必然，它所包含的可能是具体的现实的可能。这样的必然一方面是相对于我们一时一地所达到的科学水平的，另一方面是相对于具体条件之下的客观规律的，这样一个看法之下的必然是客观事物的必然的反映。这样的必然是活的必然，不是死的，是辩证的必然，不是形而上学的必然。排除归纳的不是科学的必然，而是形而上学的必然。
    作者认为把归纳排除出形式逻辑的范围之外是有学术思想支持的，这实在就是巴克莱、休谟、马赫哲学在形式逻辑“理论”上的表现。作者深深体会到他的根深蒂固的形而上学的思想方法是和理论脱离实际分不开的。
    最后，作者认为他的这个自我批判没有提出形式逻辑的客观基础问题，这是一个根本的缺点。这个要留待将来补上。作者希望旧同事和青年都能参加这个批判。
