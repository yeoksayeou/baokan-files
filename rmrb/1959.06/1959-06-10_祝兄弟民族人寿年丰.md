    Congratulations to our Brotherly Nationalities for Prosperity and Longevity
    We are delighted to see the significant increase in the population of our brotherly nationalities. The population growth of our brotherly nationalities signifies that, with the help of our Party and the People's Government, the 36 million people of minority nationalities in our country have completely changed the painful and tragic situation of the past, where "one only saw mothers conceive, but not children walk," and have entered a new era of "thriving population and good life." This means that in the vast land that accounts for about 60 percent of our country's total area, more and more new forces will continue to grow, develop the rich treasures there, and build our great socialist motherland. We congratulate our brotherly nationalities on their flourishing population and longevity; we congratulate our great motherland on constantly adding new forces for socialist construction.

    祝兄弟民族人寿年丰
    我们为兄弟民族的人口有了显著增加而感到高兴。兄弟民族人口的增长，意味着我国三千六百万少数民族人民在我们党和人民政府的帮助下，已经彻底改变了过去“只见娘怀胎，不见儿走路”的痛苦悲惨情景，进入了“人口兴旺生活好”的新时代。这意味着在占我国总面积百分之六十左右的广阔土地上，将不断地有更多的新生力量成长起来，开发那里的丰富宝藏，建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国。我们祝贺兄弟民族人丁兴旺，人寿年丰；我们祝贺伟大祖国不断增添社会主义建设的新生力量。
