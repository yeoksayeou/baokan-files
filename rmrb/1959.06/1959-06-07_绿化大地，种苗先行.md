    Greening the Land, Seedlings First
    By Our Commentator
    Without seeds, there are no seedlings; without seedlings, there are no big trees. Good seeds make good seedlings, and good seedlings make good trees. To green the barren land, seedling cultivation must come first.
    With the rapid advancement of the cause of greening the motherland and the widespread development of the movement for fast-growing and high-yielding forests, new tasks have been put forward for the current seedling work: more quantity, better quality, and appropriate varieties.
    The quantity of seedlings directly affects the speed of greening. Everyone hopes to realize the beautiful ideal of "mountains all green, waters all clear" and "deserts turned into fertile land, the earth all gardens" as soon as possible; production and construction also urgently need more and more trees; if seedling work cannot keep up, the speed of greening will inevitably be delayed; this is naturally not in line with the needs of the country and the wishes of the people.
    The quality of seedlings directly affects the quality of afforestation. Every year, we mobilize millions of people to the mountains and deserts to plant trees, and spare precious time from busy agricultural activities to plant trees; if the seedlings are not good, the young forests cannot be guaranteed to survive and grow well, which is essentially a great waste, not only wasting manpower, but also wasting material and financial resources.
    Whether the variety of seedlings is appropriate is also closely related to whether the afforestation work can be carried out according to plan. A shortage of urgently needed varieties, or varieties not adapted to the region, is not conducive to completing afforestation tasks according to plan and in proportion.
    Experience in recent years has proved that where the seedling work is done well, the quality of afforestation is high and the progress of greening is fast. In many areas, seed collection and seedling cultivation have become a conscious action of the masses. Many people's communes and production teams of the communes have established their own nurseries, and large-scale seedling production has emerged. The general law of obtaining fine varieties and strong seedlings has been mastered by many people. The tremendous achievements of afforestation in our country in recent years have been created on this basis. As long as we continue to exert our efforts and make full use of this most fundamental favorable condition, the seedling problem can be completely solved.
    Experience in recent years has also proved that if the seedling work is not done well, it will not only directly affect the progress and quality of afforestation, but also frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation to a certain extent. For example, in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, the original plan was to afforest 1.5 million mu last spring, and holes had already been dug in the forest land; but due to insufficient seedling preparation in advance, it was found that there was a shortage of seeds and seedlings during afforestation, and only 900,000 mu were afforested, failing to complete the afforestation plan. A similar situation occurred in Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia, where the masses had a high enthusiasm for afforestation and wanted to afforest 600,000 mu during the rainy season last year; however, due to insufficient seedlings, only about half of the original afforestation plan was completed. These situations all show that seedling shortage is still the first problem to be solved in afforestation work.
    Attaching importance only to afforestation and not to seedlings essentially reflects two kinds of thinking and practices: one is to view afforestation work in isolation, separating seedling preparation from afforestation. Only when the afforestation season arrives do they think of afforestation, regarding afforestation work only as a temporary rush job, without paying attention to combining long-term preparation (mainly done by professional teams) with short-term rush (mass mobilization during afforestation), and without seeing the danger of afforestation failing if seedling work is not done well. Another kind of thinking is to "reap without sowing," not paying attention to seed collection and seedling cultivation themselves, waiting for others to collect seeds and cultivate seedlings for their own use, and reaching out to demand allocation when the afforestation season arrives. Of course, state-owned nurseries have the responsibility to supply a part of the seedlings, and cooperation between regions and units is also necessary; however, relying solely on these is far from enough to meet the needs of the afforestation movement. To change these two kinds of thinking and practices, first of all, all regions and communes must make comprehensive arrangements and early arrangements, include seedling work in the annual work plan and production plan, and determine responsibilities to be borne by specific personnel. Secondly, we must adhere to the "three self" policy of "self-collection of seeds, self-cultivation of seedlings, and self-afforestation." In this way, not only can seedlings be reliably guaranteed, and the varieties be more suitable for local and community needs, but also a large amount of transportation labor can be saved, losses on the road can be avoided, and the survival rate of afforestation can be improved.
    Based on the local needs of afforestation, mobilizing the masses, adapting to local conditions, and cultivating seedlings in every commune and team are the fundamental measures to develop the afforestation cause in a more, faster, better and more economical way, and also the main way to solve the seedling problem. Schools, government agencies, and organizations using vacant land to cultivate seedlings are also a force that cannot be ignored. (Last year, the seedlings cultivated by various government agencies and organizations in Xintai County, Shandong Province, played a certain role in afforestation.) State-owned nurseries in various places must also continue to be strengthened, and some areas should also develop appropriately. In addition to ensuring the supply of seedlings needed for state afforestation, state-owned nurseries should also strive to supply a part of the seedlings needed for mass afforestation; more importantly, they should gain experience in improving technology, cultivate more valuable tree species, and help and guide the masses in carrying out seed collection and seedling cultivation.
    How can we obtain enough high-quality seeds? The main measures are to delineate certain mother tree forest areas and pay attention to management. For the existing mother tree forests, we must protect and nurture them well to improve their yield; areas that have not yet established mother tree forest areas should conduct pilot projects first and gradually establish them according to local afforestation tasks and specific conditions. Seed collection plans should be implemented in various communes and production teams.
    How can we get enough good quality seedlings? The main measures are to strengthen the management of nurseries. Whether they are plots of land or scattered nurseries, we must immediately establish a production responsibility system, divide areas and assign them to people to take responsibility, implement the management system of "three guarantees" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing production, guaranteeing costs) and "four fixings" (fixing people, fixing quality, fixing quantity, fixing time), and "five to the nurseries" (seeds, fertilizers, output, measures, and management personnel are all assigned to the nursery). Seedling cultivation tasks should also be implemented in the communes and production teams.
    To cultivate a large number of high-quality seedlings, we must earnestly and conscientiously implement technical measures, achieve deep plowing and fine preparation, sufficient fertilizer and water, carefully selected fine varieties, reasonable close planting, and prevention and elimination of five pests (drought, flood, disease, insects, and weeds), to ensure that one mu is planted and one mu is harvested, with high yields and healthy plants in every mu.
    In order to strive to meet the needs of production and construction and the various aspects of people's lives, seedling cultivation should be carried out in a planned way. Not only should we cultivate timber tree species, but also cultivate a certain number of fruit trees, economic forest seedlings, etc.; not only should we cultivate fast-growing tree species native to the local area, but also introduce excellent tree species from other places. We should gradually achieve the planned supply of afforestation needs, so that seedling work can truly be the pioneer of afforestation work.

    绿化大地，种苗先行
    本报评论员
    没有种子就没有小苗，没有小苗就没有大树。有好种才能有好苗，有好苗才能有好树。绿化荒山大地，种苗必须先行。
    随着绿化祖国的事业的飞跃前进，林木速生丰产运动的广泛开展，给当前种苗工作提出了新的任务：数量上要多，质量上要好，品种要适当。
    种苗的多少直接影响到绿化速度的快慢。谁都希望早日实现“有山皆绿，无水不清”
  “沙漠变成沃土，大地皆是园林”的美好理想；生产建设也迫切需要更多更多的林木；如果种苗工作跟不上去，绿化速度就势必延缓；这自然是不符合国家的需要和人民的愿望的。
    种苗的好坏直接影响着造林质量的优劣。每年我们都要动员千百万人到山上去，到荒漠去造林，要在繁忙的农事活动中抽出宝贵的时间植树；如果种苗不好，幼林就不能保证成活得多、生长得好，这实质上是一种很大的浪费，不仅浪费了人力，而且浪费了物力财力。
    种苗的品种适当与否，也同造林工作能否按计划进行有密切关系。迫切需要的品种缺少，或者品种和地区不相适应，都不利于按计划按比例地完成造林任务。
    几来年的经验证明：哪个地区的种苗工作做得好，哪里造林的质量就高，绿化的进度就快。在不少地区，采种育苗已经成为群众自觉的行动，很多人民公社和公社的生产队建立了自己的苗圃，出现了大面积的苗木丰产，取得良种壮苗的一般规律已为很多群众所掌握。近几年来，我国造林的巨大成绩，正是在这样的基础上创造出来的。只要继续鼓足干劲，充分利用这个最根本的有利条件，种苗问题是完全可以解决的。
    几年来的经验也证明了：种苗工作做得不好，不仅直接影响造林的进度和质量，而且会在一定程度上挫折群众造林的积极性。如河北省邯郸专区，去年春季原计划造林一百五十万亩，并且已经在林地上挖好了穴；但由于事先种苗准备不足，到造林时发现缺种少苗，结果只造了九十万亩，没有完成造林计划。发生类似情况的还有内蒙古昭乌达盟，该盟群众造林积极性很高，要在去年雨季造林六十万亩；可是由于种苗不够，结果也只完成了原造林计划的一半左右。这些情况都说明了，种苗不足仍然是造林工作中必须首先解决的问题。
    只重视造林，不重视种苗，这种现象实质上反映了两种思想和作法：一是孤立地看待造林工作，把准备种苗和造林分了家，到了造林季节才想到造林，把造林工作只看成一时的突击工作，没有注意到把长期准备（主要是由专业队来做）和短期突击（造林时全民动员）结合起来，没有看到种苗工作作不好造林就有落空的危险。又一种思想是“坐享其成”，自己不注意采种育苗，等着别人采种育苗给自己用，到了造林季节就伸手要求调拨。当然，国营苗圃有供应一部分种苗的责任，各地区、单位之间的协作也是必要的；但是，只靠这些是远不能满足造林运动的需要的。要改变这两种思想和作法，首先，各地区、各公社要全面安排、及早安排，要把种苗工作列入全年的工作计划、生产计划，并且要确定责任，由专人负责。其次，要坚持执行“自采种、自育苗、自造林”的“三自”方针。这样，不但可以使种苗有可靠的保证，品种比较适合本地、本社的需要，还可以大量节约运输的劳动力，避免路途上的损失，并提高造林成活率。
    根据当地造林的需要，发动群众，因地制宜，社社育苗，队队育苗，是多快好省地发展造林事业的根本措施，也是解决种苗问题的主要途径。各学校、机关、团体利用隙地育苗也是不可忽视的力量。（去年山东省新泰县各机关团体培育的苗木在造林中就起了一定作用。）各地的国营苗圃也必须继续加强，有的地区还应适当发展。国营苗圃除了保证供应国家造林所需要的种苗以外，还应当力求供应一部分群众造林所需要的种苗；更重要的是取得改进技术的经验，培育比较珍贵的树种，帮助和指导群众开展采种育苗工作。
    怎样才能取得足够的优良的种子呢？主要措施是划定一定的母树林区并注意经营管理。对于现有的母树林，要保护好抚育好，使它们提高产量；还没有建立母树林区的地区，应根据当地造林任务和具体情况，先行试点，逐步建立。采种计划要落实到各公社和各生产队。
    怎样才能得到足够的优良的苗木呢？主要措施是加强苗圃的管理。不论成块的还是零星的苗圃，都要立即建立生产责任制，分区划片包干，实行“三包”（包工、包产、包成本）、
  “四定”（定人、定质、定量、定时）、“五到圃”（种子、肥料、产量、措施、管理人都按片分到苗圃）的管理制度。育苗任务也要落实到公社和生产队。
    培育数量多质量好的苗木，必须切实认真执行技术措施，作到深耕细整、肥足水够、精选良种、合理密植、防除五害（旱、涝、病、虫、草），以保证育一亩收一亩，亩亩丰产，株株健壮。
    为了力求满足生产建设和人民生活的各方面的需要，培育种苗应当有计划地进行。不只要培育用材树种，也要培育一定数量的果树、经济林苗木等等；不仅要培育本乡本土的速生树种，也要引种外地的优良树种。逐步作到有计划地供应造林需要，让种苗工作切实当好造林工作的先行官。
