    河南各地夏忙期间精心管理牲畜
    本报讯　河南各地采用多种办法加强牲畜饲养工作，使牲畜膘肥体壮，以保证夏收夏种任务的胜利完成。
    在夏忙期间，各地普遍制订了劳役定额，保证安全使役；大部分地区给牲畜增加了饲养精料。长葛县根据牲口不同的体质规定了使役时间。方城县最近为牲畜调拨二十九万斤饲料，郾城县每头牲畜由每天吃料一斤增加到二斤半。不少地方，在大忙期间也坚持由专人割青草喂牲口。镇平、唐河、新野等县有三万五千多人，一周内割青草八千三百多万斤。
    各地对牲畜的保护工作也加强了。很多地方给牲畜搭了过夏的凉棚。各地还组织兽医突击队，分片包干，开展疫病防治工作。据郾城、扶沟等二十五个县初步统计，组织了六千七百多名兽医和防疫员，巡回治疗牲畜疫病。
