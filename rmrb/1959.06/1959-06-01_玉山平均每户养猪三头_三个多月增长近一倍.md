Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 31st – Currently, Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, has increased its number of pigs from over 90,000 at the time of the Spring Festival to over 179,000, averaging three pigs per household, a 35% increase compared to the same period last year.

The reason for the rapid development of pig production in Yushan County is mainly due to the strengthening of leadership by Party committees at all levels and the correct implementation of the policy of simultaneously promoting collective and private raising. Throughout the county, livestock headquarters and command posts have been universally established from the county level down to the production team level. In order to ensure the implementation of pig development plans, Party organizations at all levels in the county have recently adopted methods of assigning areas of responsibility, dividing labor, conducting inspections, and solving problems simultaneously. These measures have effectively arranged specific steps for all levels to complete their pig-raising plans, and have helped commune members resolve difficulties in feed and time involved in private pig raising. After the implementation of these measures, the enthusiasm of commune members for raising pigs has generally increased.

    玉山平均每户养猪三头
    三个多月增长近一倍
    新华社南昌31日电江西玉山县目前饲养的生猪已由春节时的九万多头增加到十七万九千多头，平均每户养猪三头，比去年同期增长35％。
    玉山县生猪生产发展快的原因，主要是各级党委加强领导，正确贯彻了公养和私养同时并举的方针。全县从县到生产队普遍建立了畜牧业指挥部和指挥所。为了使发展生猪计划落实，这个县各级党组织最近采取划片包干、分工负责，边检查、边解决问题的办法，切实安排了各级完成养猪计划的具体措施，帮助社员解决了私人养猪在饲料、时间方面存在的困难。这些措施实行后，社员养猪积极性普遍高涨。
