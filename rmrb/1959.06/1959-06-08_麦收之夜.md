　　The Wheat Harvest Night
　　Yi Gengde

　　As soon as it got dark, the stars came out in droves. The road south of Zhou Village was full of people and carts returning from the wheat harvest. The sounds of people talking and laughing, the turning of wheels, the cracking of whips, and the sound of hooves mingled together.

　　Two production team leaders walked side by side in the crowd, talking and laughing. One was Zhou Xiaoming, the captain of the Third Production Team of the Zhou Village Management District, and the other was Du Guiquan, the captain of the Second Production Team of the Du Family Village Management District. Although they belonged to the same commune, Du Family Village was located in the waist of Zhongtiao Mountain, where the climate was cooler, and the wheat fields were still lush green; while Zhou Village was located in the plains below the mountain, where the wheat fields were already shimmering with golden light. Therefore, the two management districts recently signed a wheat harvest cooperation agreement. Du Guiquan led his team to Zhou Xiaoming's production team today according to the contract.

　　The people entered the village and arrived at the canteen. The owner of the canteen had already arranged everything for his guests. More than a dozen washbasins and towels were placed in the yard; two-foot-high small square tables were evenly placed in the room, with small stools all around, and chopsticks and two large vegetable plates were placed on the tables, one with cold bean sprouts and bamboo shoots, and the other with fried garlic sprouts and leeks. People washed their hands and faces roughly and went into the room to sit down. In an instant, white fluffy steamed buns and hot bean and rice soup were brought over tray after tray. The guests repeatedly used the words "too unconventional" to complain to the host with gratitude. The two captains, ignoring this, continued to discuss the problems in today's harvest while eating.

　　During the conversation, Du Guiquan suddenly stood up and said:
　　"Comrades of Du Family Village, after eating, Tian Aiyun, Li Xiulan, and Li Jiufeng go to sharpen the sickles, and the rest go to the wheat field to participate in stacking the wheat." Zhou Xiaoming stood up anxiously when he heard this and said: "No, no! We have already arranged it, everyone should seize the time to rest..." He wanted to say something more, but Du Guiquan pulled him down to sit down. Du Guiquan said: "Xiaoming, what are you doing?" Zhou Xiaoming said: "Yes, what are you doing? The contract doesn't stipulate that everyone should stack the wheat!" Du Guiquan said: "But the contract doesn't stipulate that you should go to sleep after putting down your chopsticks after dinner." The two argued like a debate.

　　People quickly left the dining table and headed to the wheat field. Du Guiquan and Zhou Xiaoming's debate had to end unresolved, and they finally walked towards the wheat field as well.

　　Tian Aiyun, Li Xiulan, and Li Jiufeng, three young women, returned to their lodgings, talking and laughing all the way. Jiufeng entered the door first, turning on the flashlight to find the lamp to light, and said in surprise: "Hey, Aiyun, where did you put the sickle and scythe just now, how come there are only a few whetstones on the ground?" Tian Aiyun said: "What can I do when the guy with many feet and few eyes can't see such a big pile of sickles even with his eyes as bright as light bulbs!" Saying that, she and Xiulan walked in. Jiufeng had already lit the lamp. But none of the three could see the shadow of the sickle. Jiufeng retaliated: "Aiyun, people with many feet and few eyes can't see it, but how can you, with many eyes and few feet, not see it?" Xiulan said: "Aiyun, you're new here, maybe you went to the wrong door..." Aiyun said: "Definitely not, maybe someone took it..." Jiufeng said:
　　"Right, it must have been the wrong door. Who took it? Now there are still..." Aiyun stopped her and said: "Listen, it's getting off track again. Maybe that kind person took it to sharpen it for us, let's go out and look for it!" Xiulan said:
　　"Let's go, it's guaranteed not to be lost!" Jiufeng said: "What a carefree thought! I'm not going, you go get the ready-made sharp sickles that others have sharpened for us." Aiyun and Xiulan both jumped out of the door.

　　Many people make light work. A gasoline lamp hung in the wheat field. The members of Du Guiquan's production team and Zhou Xiaoming's production team, regardless of each other, mixed together, those who carried, those who lifted high, those who swept, it was really a surge of energy. Before long, the wheat bundles crisscrossing the field were piled into two large rectangular stacks, and some threshed wheat stalks and chaff were built on top of the stacks, like roofs, like two rows of thatched houses.

　　When Du Guiquan and the members returned, the room was quiet, with only a gleam of light shining on a few whetstones. "Where are the people sharpening the sickles?" Du Guiquan thought to himself. In the sound of people talking, Li Jiufeng sat up in the corner of the bed, rubbing her eyes, and asked hesitantly: "Did you find it back?" It turned out that after Tian Aiyun and Li Xiulan left, Li Jiufeng was dragged into sleep by fatigue for a while. When the people stacking the wheat came back, she thought it was Aiyun and Xiulan. When Du Guiquan heard this, he was confused and asked: "Jiufeng, find what back?" This sentence was like a bucket of cold water poured on Jiufeng's head, and she woke up. When she opened her eyes and saw, she couldn't help but burst out laughing. Then she told the story of looking for the sickle. Du Guiquan felt a little uneasy after hearing this, and he compressed what he wanted to say into one sentence: "Everyone, seize the time to rest!" After saying that, he walked out alone again and ran to the work point recording office of Zhou Xiaoming's production team.

　　The window of the work point recording office was brightly lit, and there was laughter inside. Du Guiquan went in and saw, sure enough, Aiyun, Xiulan, and Zhou Xiaoming and several young men and women members of his team were all here, and the sharpened sickles and scythes were piled on the ground. When Zhou Xiaoming saw Du Guiquan coming in, he asked the people on the spot: "What do you think of my Zhuge Liang?" Everyone said: "Really, you calculated it accurately!" Du Guiquan knew that there was meaning in these words, so he said: "You also see what you think of my Kongming?" Everyone was stunned. Zhou Xiaoming said: "I just arrived here and calculated that you would come in a moment. As soon as the words fell, you came in, worthy of being Zhuge. What about you?" Du Guiquan said: "I calculated that your people took our 'weapons', and our people chased them to your place, of course, it's Kongming." Their words made everyone laugh.

　　Du Guiquan said: "Everyone is tired, let's rest and prepare for the battle tomorrow." Tian Aiyun said: "This year's wheat is really pleasing, you can fight continuously for three days and three nights without rest." Zhou Xiaoming said: "There should be a balance between work and rest, let's rest quickly."

　　When they came out, the sky was like a boundless blue glass plate, with countless silver stars inlaid on it. A night breeze brought the clear chirping of cuckoos in the fields. Tian Aiyun was moved by the scene and said: "Great! Let the night wind and this migratory bird spread the friendship between our two teams to faraway places!" Du Guiquan patted Zhou Xiaoming on the shoulder and whispered: "Listen, she is indeed a girl who graduated from middle school!"

    麦收之夜
    仪庚德
    天刚黑下来，星星成群结伙的往出走。周村村南的路上，满是收麦回来的人群和麦车。人们的说笑声，车轮的运转声，鞭子声，畜蹄声交织成一团。
    人群里并肩走着两个生产队长，又说又笑。一个是周村管理区第三生产队的队长周小明，一个是杜家庄管理区第二生产队的队长杜贵全。他们虽是一个公社，但杜家庄在中条山腰，气候较凉，麦田还是一片青翠；而周村在山下平川，麦田已经遍闪金光。因此两个管理区最近签订了麦收协作合同。杜贵全就是根据合同带领人马，于今天赶到周小明的生产队来的。
    人们走进村子，来到了食堂。食堂的主人，早为自己的客人安排停当了一切。院子里放着十几个洗脸盆和毛巾；屋子里匀称的摆着二尺高的小方桌，四旁都有小板凳，桌上放着筷子和两个大菜盘，一盘是凉拌豆芽和笋丝，一盘是炒蒜苔和韭菜。人们粗粗地洗过手脸，就走进屋子坐下来。霎时，白松松的馒头和热烫烫的豆儿米汤，一木盘一木盘的端过来。客人们纷纷用“太不家常了”的话，带着谢意埋怨着主人。两个队长，没管这些，仍在吃饭中继续交谈着今天开镰收割中的问题。
    交谈中，杜贵全突然站起来说：
   “杜家庄的社员同志们，吃罢饭，田爱云、李秀兰、李九凤去磨镰，其余的都到麦场上参加积麦。”周小明一听，也站起来着急地说：“不要，不要！我们早安排好了，大家抓紧时间休息吧……”他还想说什么，但被杜贵全一把拉着坐下来。杜贵全说：“小明，你这是干什么？”周小明说：“是啊，你这是干什么？合同上并没规定要大家积麦呀！”杜贵全说：“可是合同上也没规定放下晚饭的筷碗就睡觉。”两人开辩论会似的争执着。
    人们很快离开饭桌走向麦场上。杜贵全和周小明的辩论也只好不了了之，他们最后也朝麦场上走去。
    田爱云、李秀兰、李九凤三个年轻妇女，一路说笑回到他们住宿的地方。九凤先进门，一边打着手电找灯来点，一边吃惊地说：“咳，怎么，爱云，你刚才把麦镰和钐刀都放哪去啦，怎么地上只有几块磨石呢？”田爱云说：“脚多眼少的家伙，眼瞪得像电灯泡一样亮，可看不见偌大一堆镰，有什么办法！”说着和秀兰走进来。九凤已经点起了灯。但三个人都看不到镰刀的影子。九凤报复说：“爱云，人家脚多眼少看不见，你该眼多脚少，却怎么也看不见呢？”秀兰说：“爱云，生地方，你是不是走错门儿……”爱云说：“绝不是，也许是谁拿去了……”九凤说：
  “对，准是跑错门儿了。谁拿去了？现在还有……”爱云拉住话头说：“听，又扯到茄子地里去了。也许是那个好心人拿去替咱们磨了，咱们出去找找吧！”秀兰说：
  “走，保险丢不了！”九凤说：“想得多么心宽！我不去，你们去拿别人替咱磨现成的快镰吧。”爱云、秀兰两人都跳着走出了门。
    人多好干活。麦场上吊着一盏汽灯。杜贵全生产队和周小明生产队的社员，不分你我，搅成一团，搬运的搬运，举高的举高，打扫的打扫，真是干劲冲天。不多一会儿，满场纵横的麦捆，被堆成了两个长方形的大堆，堆顶上又搭起了些碾过的麦秸和麦糠，房顶一样，仿佛两排茅屋。
    杜贵全和社员们回来的时候，屋内静悄悄的，只有一片灯光照着几块磨石。“磨镰的人呢？”杜贵全心里想。人们说话声中，床角里坐起了李九凤，一边揉眼睛，一边支吾地问：“找回啦没有？”原来田爱云和李秀兰走后，李九凤一会儿就被疲乏拖进了梦境，积麦的人回来，她当是爱云和秀兰。杜贵全一听，没头没脑，就问：“九凤，找回什么了？”这句话像一瓢冷水泼在九凤头上，才清醒过来，睁眼一看，不觉噗嗤一笑。然后把找麦镰的事说了一遍。杜贵全听了又有些不安，他将想说的话压缩到一句：“大家抓紧时间休息吧！”说罢又独自走出来，信步跑到周小明生产队的记工室。
    记工室的窗上一片灯亮，里面说说笑笑。杜贵全进去一看，可不，爱云、秀兰，还有周小明和他队的几个青年男女社员都在这里，地上堆着磨好的麦镰和钐刀。周小明见杜贵全进来，就问当场的人们：“看我这个诸葛亮怎么样？”大家说：“真的，算得准！”杜贵全听了早知道这话里有意思，就说：“你们也看看我这个孔明怎么样？”大家怔住了。周小明说：“我刚到这里就算出你霎时就会来，话刚落音，你就进门，称得起诸葛。你呢？”杜贵全说：“我算准了你们的人拿去了我们的‘武器’，我们的人追到你们这里，当然是孔明。”他俩的话逗得人们哄堂大笑。
    杜贵全说：“都累了，还是休息吧，准备明天继续战斗。”田爱云说：“今年麦子真叫人喜欢透啦，不休息也能连战三天三夜。”周小明说：“有劳有逸嘛，还是快休息。”
    他们走出来的时候，天空像一块无边的青色玻璃板，上面镶着无数的银星，一阵夜风，吹来田间布谷鸟的清脆的啼声。田爱云即景生情说：“好啊！让夜风和这只候鸟将我们两个队的情谊传到远远的地方！”杜贵全拍了一下周小明的肩头小声说：“你听，到底是中学毕业的姑娘！”
