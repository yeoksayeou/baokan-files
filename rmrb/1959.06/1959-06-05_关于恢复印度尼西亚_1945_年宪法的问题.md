    On the Question of Restoring the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia
    Question: The Indonesian Constitutional Assembly failed to pass the government's proposal to restore the 1945 Constitution after three votes. What is the 1945 Constitution, and how was the proposal to restore it put forward? Beijing Reader Wang Li
    Answer: The 1945 Constitution was the first constitution of the Republic of Indonesia. The current Provisional Constitution was created in August 1950.
    The 1945 Constitution was created at the height of Indonesia's struggle for independence, so it absorbed some positive content with an anti-colonial spirit. The preamble to this constitution states that "Independence is the right of every nation, therefore, colonialism in the world must be abolished." It emphasizes that the state should control large enterprises that affect the national economy and the people's livelihood and national resources.
    If the 1945 Constitution is restored, it will bring about significant changes to Indonesia's political system. The 1945 Constitution stipulates a presidential cabinet system, granting the president great power: the president holds government power, directly leads the cabinet, appoints and removes cabinet members, and holds the supreme command of the army, navy, and air force, and also has certain legislative powers. The president is elected by the People's Consultative Assembly for a term of five years.
    There will also be significant changes in the parliamentary system. The Provisional Constitution implements a unicameral system, that is, only the Parliament. The 1945 Constitution stipulates that, in addition to the "People's Representative Council" of the Parliament, there is also a People's Consultative Assembly, which is the highest organ of state power. The Parliament is a legislative body and not the highest organ of power. The president and the cabinet are not responsible to the Parliament, and the Parliament has no right to interfere in the work of the government or appoint or remove the cabinet. The future president and the government he leads will not be influenced by the Parliament composed of party (and professional class representatives) members.
    Compared with the Provisional Constitution, the 1945 Constitution has fewer articles and is incomplete in some aspects, such as the lack of provisions on the national emblem. Regarding the basic rights of the people, Article 28 of this Constitution stipulates that freedom of assembly, association, and speech shall be stipulated by law. The Provisional Constitution has more specific provisions on the basic and democratic rights of the people, such as the right to strike, march, and demonstrate.
    On April 22 this year, President Sukarno, on behalf of the government, formally proposed at the Constitutional Assembly meeting held in Bandung to restore the 1945 Constitution as the fixed constitution of the Indonesian state. In explaining the reasons for the government's decision, President Sukarno pointed out that the implementation of Western democracy has resulted in a large number of bad phenomena. Therefore, we must reconsider this issue and use revolutionary means to change Indonesia's social system and state system.
    The Indonesian government's proposal to fully restore the 1945 Constitution has been supported by 29 parties, including the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Communist Party, the Catholic Party, and the Christian Party, but has been opposed by eight Muslim political parties, including the Masyumi Party and the Nahdlatul Ulama.
    U.S. imperialism is using the issue of restoring the 1945 Constitution to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. According to a report by the Indonesian National News Agency, since the Constitutional Assembly began discussing the government's proposal, the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia has sent people to actively participate in the meeting. John Paul Haiman, the third secretary of the U.S. Embassy, has been engaging in activities to win over members of certain political parties. Sakirman, the fourth vice-chairman of the Constitutional Assembly, revealed that the United States is doing everything possible to exert influence on certain groups or parties in order to make them refuse to restore the 1945 Constitution.

### 关于恢复印度尼西亚1945年宪法的问题

    关于恢复印度尼西亚1945年宪法的问题
    问：印度尼西亚制宪议会经过三次投票未能通过政府提出的恢复1945年宪法的建议，什么是1945年宪法，恢复这个宪法的建议是怎样提出的？　北京读者　王　里
    答：1945年宪法是印度尼西亚共和国的第一部宪法。现行临时宪法则是在1950年8月产生的。
    1945年宪法产生的时候，正处在印度尼西亚独立斗争的高潮中，所以这部宪法吸收了一些具有反殖民主义精神的有积极意义的内容。这部宪法的序言说“独立是每个民族应有的权利，因此，世界上的殖民主义必须消灭”。它强调由国家控制影响国计民生的大企业及国家富源。
    1945年宪法如果恢复，将使印度尼西亚的政治制度发生很大的变化。1945年宪法规定实行总统制内阁，赋予总统很大的权力：总统掌握政府权力，直接领导内阁，任免阁员和执掌陆海空三军的最高统帅权，还有一定的立法权力。总统由人民协商会议选出，任期五年。
    在议会制度方面也将有很大的变化。临时宪法实行一院制，就是只有国会。1945年宪法则规定，除了国会“人民代表会议”之外，还有一个作为国家最高权力机关的人民协商会议。国会是立法机构，不是最高权力机关。总统和内阁不向国会负责，国会无权干涉政府工作和任免内阁，将来的总统及其领导的政府将不受由党派（还有职业阶层代表）议员组成的国会的影响。
    和临时宪法比较，1945年宪法条文较少，有些方面还不完备，如对国徽没有规定。对于人民的基本权利，这部宪法第二十八条规定集会、结社、言论自由等由法令规定之。而临时宪法关于罢工、游行示威等人民基本权利和民主权利都有比较具体的规定。
    今年4月22日，苏加诺总统在万隆举行的制宪议会会议上，代表政府正式建议恢复1945年宪法作为印度尼西亚国家的固定的宪法。苏加诺总统在说明政府作出这一决定的理由时指出，实施西方民主的结果出现了大量的坏现象。因此，我们必须重新考虑这个问题，并且用革命的手段来改变印度尼西亚的社会制度和国家制度。
    印度尼西亚政府提出完全恢复1945年宪法的建议，得到了印度尼西亚国民党、共产党、天主教党和基督教党等二十九个党派的支持，却遭到马斯友美党、伊斯兰教师联合会等八个穆斯林政党的反对。
    美帝国主义利用这次恢复1945年宪法的问题，对印度尼西亚的内政进行干涉。据印度尼西亚民族通讯社报道，自从制宪议会开始讨论政府的建议时起，美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆就派人积极参加这次会议。美国大使馆的三等秘书约翰·保罗·海曼对某些政党的议员进行拉拢活动。制宪议会第四副主席萨基尔曼揭露说，美国千方百计地对某些集团或政党施加影响，以便使他们拒绝恢复1945年宪法。
