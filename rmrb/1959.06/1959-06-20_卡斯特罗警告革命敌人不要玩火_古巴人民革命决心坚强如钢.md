Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 18th: Premier Castro, in a televised address to the Cuban people last night, warned the enemies of the Cuban Revolution who are playing with fire. He said, "The Cuban people's determination to carry out the revolution is as firm as steel, and the enemies will only break their heads against it."

Castro's lengthy televised address lasted from last night until this morning.

During Castro's televised address, four bomb explosions occurred in Havana. Castro pointed out that counter-revolutionaries are using all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to oppose the Cuban Revolution. He believes that the bomb explosions are "inseparably linked to the increasingly rampant counter-revolutionary activities at home and abroad." Castro firmly stated, "The Cuban revolution is a fierce revolution, an invincible one. The victors will be the people! Traitors and betrayers are greatly mistaken if they think they can do whatever they want!" Castro also warned enemies at home and abroad, "The Cuban people are high in spirit, they are determined to advance the revolution at all costs, and to punish tyrants, traitors and criminals."

Premier Castro called on the people to mobilize. He said that a mass rally of 500,000 people will be held in the capital on July 26th. He said that this will be a demonstration of great unity of all Cubans. Those attending will include farmers from the Sierra Maestra mountains, the old base of the Cuban rebel army. Castro called on the residents of Havana to assist these farmers and entertain them. At this time, many television viewers immediately called the television station to respond to the Premier's call.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 17th: President Urrutia said yesterday that the Cuban people will certainly be able to repel foreign aggression. The President expressed the above determination when answering questions from reporters of the Latin American News Agency about the possibility of an adventurous attack from the Dominican dictatorial regime. Urrutia said: Since the Cuban armed forces and people defeated Batista's mercenary army and overthrew the dictatorial regime, it is conceivable what kind of blow they would give to Trujillo or other foreign aggressors.

Urrutia pointed out that Trujillo's dictatorial rule is already extremely corrupt and tottering.

The Cuban Minister of National Defense and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces also expressed the same confidence as the President. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Raúl Castro, told reporters: "The armed forces are fully prepared and ready to repel and defeat any attack on our revolution by enemies at home and abroad."

On the 17th, the armed forces arrested two conspirators in Santiago, Cuba, and seized weapons and explosives. The rebellious conspirators attempted to sneak into the countryside to launch a rebellion. In addition, a prisoner riot occurred in Havana on the 16th, which was completely quelled by the government on the same day with the cooperation of the people.

    卡斯特罗警告革命敌人不要玩火
     古巴人民革命决心坚强如钢
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　卡斯特罗总理昨晚对古巴人民发表电视演说时对正在玩火的古巴革命的敌人提出了警告。他说：“古巴人民实现革命的决心像钢铁一般坚强，敌人是要碰得头破血流的。”
    卡斯特罗的长篇电视演说从昨晚一直延续到今天早晨才结束。
    在卡斯特罗发表电视演说时，哈瓦那曾发生四起炸弹爆炸事件。卡斯特罗指出，反革命分子正在利用种种阴谋诡计来反对古巴革命。他认为炸弹爆炸事件“不可能不同国内外日益猖狂的反革命活动有关。”卡斯特罗坚定地说：“古巴的革命是一场猛烈的革命，是不可战胜的。胜利者将是人民！叛徒和卖国贼们如果以为他们可以为所欲为就大错特错了！”卡斯特罗同时警告国内外的敌人说：“古巴人民斗志昂扬，他们决心不惜一切代价使革命向前发展，惩罚暴君、叛徒和罪犯。”
    卡斯特罗总理号召人民动员起来。他说，7月26日将在首都举行一次有五十万人参加的群众大会。他说，这将是一次全体古巴人大团结的示威。与会的人将包括从古巴起义军老根据地马埃斯特腊山区来的农民。卡斯特罗号召哈瓦那市民协助这些农民，招待他们。这时，许多电视观众立即打电话到电视广播台，响应总理的号召。
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　乌鲁蒂亚总统昨天说，古巴人民一定能够击退外国的侵略。总统是在回答拉丁美洲通讯社记者关于来自多米尼加独裁政权冒险进攻的可能性时表示上述决心的。乌鲁蒂亚说：古巴武装部队和人民既然打垮了巴蒂斯塔的雇佣军，推翻了独裁政权，那么可以想像，他们会给特鲁希略或其他外国侵略者以怎样的打击。
    乌鲁蒂亚指出，特鲁希略的独裁统治已经腐朽透顶，摇摇欲坠。
    古巴国防部长和武装部队总司令也表示了和总统相同的信心。武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗曾对记者说：“武装部队已作好充分准备，随时能打退和打垮国内外敌人对我们革命的任何进攻。”
    武装部队17日在古巴的圣地亚哥逮捕了两名阴谋分子并缴获了武器和炸药。阴谋叛乱分子企图潜入农村发动叛乱。另外，16日在哈瓦那曾发生囚犯暴动，这次暴动在人民的协同下被政府在当天彻底平息了。
