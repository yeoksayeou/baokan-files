Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 3rd -- Indonesian Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Nasution, in his capacity as the Central Wartime Authority, announced on the 2nd that domestic political activities in Indonesia are temporarily prohibited, effective 6:00 AM on the 3rd. This order was issued after the Constitutional Assembly failed, after three votes, to pass the government's proposal to restore the 1945 Constitution.

In the order he issued, Nasution explained that "political activities" refer to specific activities carried out publicly or secretly by individuals or members of a group holding consistent views and political intentions, aiming at the interests of the group, which may directly or indirectly affect the direction of the country.

Indonesian Army spokesman Major Hasono said at a press conference today that the order issued by the Army Chief of Staff on the 2nd prohibiting political activities also means that no one may promote the following political ideologies in public or in private: Marxism, capitalism, liberalism, Islam as a political belief, populism (the doctrine advocated by the Indonesian Nationalist Party – editor's note), etc.

Hasono also announced that no news agency or newspaper may publish any statement from any political party expressing support for or opposition to the 1945 Constitution. Members of parliament can still discuss political issues in parliament, but the discussions cannot be made public. Members of parliament may not make statements outside of parliament. Only government agencies may issue statements on political and national issues.

According to a report by Antara News Agency today, Lieutenant General Nasution issued another order on the 3rd, requiring army officers and soldiers throughout Indonesia to immediately take the necessary maximum actions to deal with any group if there are indications that it wants to take advantage of the fact that the Constitutional Assembly was unable to accept the government's proposal to restore the 1945 Revolutionary Constitution to create chaos.

The Indonesian government recently submitted a proposal to the Constitutional Assembly to fully restore the 1945 Constitution, which was supported by many parties, including the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Communist Party, the Catholic Party, and the Christian Party, but was opposed by Muslim parties such as the Masyumi Party and the Nahdlatul Ulama. These Muslim parties insisted on using Islam as the basis of the state. The three votes taken by the Constitutional Assembly on this proposal on May 30, June 1, and 2 failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority vote. The Constitutional Assembly has decided to adjourn indefinitely from today.

On May 27, when the discussion on restoring the 1945 Constitution in the Constitutional Assembly reached a deadlock, Prime Minister Djuanda said at the meeting that if the Constitutional Assembly rejected the government's proposal, something that those who cherish democracy would disapprove of would happen in Indonesia.

### 印度尼西亚陆军参谋长宣布  暂时禁止国内政治活动

    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长宣布
    暂时禁止国内政治活动
    新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安中将在2日以中央战时掌权者的身份宣布：从3日上午六时开始，暂时禁止印度尼西亚国内的政治活动。这项命令是在制宪议会经过三次投票而未能通过政府提出的恢复1945年宪法的建议后发布的。
    纳苏蒂安在他发布的命令中解释说，“政治活动”指的是：个人或者某一个抱有一致观点和政治意图并且以集团的利益为目标的集团的成员，公开或者秘密地进行的可能直接或者间接地影响国家方向的具体活动。
    印度尼西亚陆军发言人哈索诺少校今天在记者招待会上说，陆军参谋长在2日发布的禁止政治活动的命令还意味着：任何人都不得在公开或者秘密场合宣传下列的政治思想：马克思主义、资本主义、自由主义、作为政治信念的伊斯兰教、平民主义（印度尼西亚国民党提倡的主义——编者注）等。
    哈索诺还宣布，任何通讯社和报纸不得发表任何政党表示赞成或者反对1945年宪法的声明。国会议员仍然可以在国会内讨论政治问题，但讨论情况不得公布。议员不得在国会外发表声明。只有政府机关才能就政治和国家问题发表声明。
    据安塔拉通讯社今天报道，纳苏蒂安中将在3日又发布了一项命令，要求印度尼西亚全国各地的陆军军官和士兵立即采取必要的最大限度的行动，来对付任何集团，如果有迹象表明它想要利用制宪议会没有能够接受政府关于恢复1945年革命宪法的建议这件事来制造混乱的话。
    印度尼西亚政府最近向制宪议会提出全盘恢复1945年宪法的建议，得到印度尼西亚国民党、共产党、天主教党、基督教党等许多党派的支持，却遭到马斯友美党、伊斯兰教师联合会等穆斯林政党的反对。这些穆斯林政党坚持要把伊斯兰教作为国家基础。在5月30日、6月1日和2日制宪议会就这项建议进行的三次表决，都未能获得三分之二的法定多数赞成票。制宪议会已经决定从今天开始无限期休会。
    5月27日在制宪议会关于恢复1945年宪法的讨论陷入僵局时，朱安达总理曾经在会上说，如果制宪议会拒绝政府的建议，那些珍爱民主的人所不赞成的事情将会在印度尼西亚发生。
