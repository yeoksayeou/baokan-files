Song of Jiangnan
Yan Zhen
Who was it last night, while people were sleeping soundly, that painted Jiangnan yellow with a single stroke of the brush? Ah, it turns out that the wheat is ripe, and the wheat waves are frolicking in the southern breeze. So many spring winds, spring rains, moons, and clear skies, so many people have walked back and forth on the field ridges, and now the rustling, bell-like wheat ears have finally sent the good news to our ears. Look, the red flags are waving, the sickles are curved, with one cut, a golden mountain appears, on the road, on the river, golden carts, golden boats, ah, the fragrance of wheat is like wine, wave after wave assaults the face. Faces covered in dust, faces covered in sweat, hearts full of sweetness, songs quietly flow to the lips: The commune joyfully opens the harvest sickle, a song sung throughout Jiangnan.

The abundant flowers on the fruit trees have withered, and the orchard is filled with lush green, I laugh at the poets of past generations, who often love to lament at this time. Thousands upon thousands of new fruits peek out from between the green leaves, comrades, look at this, what a wonderful time it is! The orioles are singing the first song, the dew on the branches is heavy, the bright and dazzling sunshine is the most faithful gardener. I love this lush green, it nurtures countless beautiful dreams: who wouldn't want to harvest trees full of ripe fruit in the golden autumn?

    江南曲
    严阵
    开镰歌是谁昨夜趁着人睡甜，一笔染黄了江南？呵，原来是麦子熟了，麦浪在南风里撒欢。多少春风春雨月明天，多少人曾在田埂上转，如今沙沙摇铃的麦穗儿，终于把喜信送到了耳边。看，红旗招展，镰刀弯弯，一镰下去，一座金山，路上，河上，金车，金船，呵，麦香似酒阵阵扑人脸。尘满脸，汗满脸，心头甜，歌曲儿悄悄流到了唇边：公社喜开丰收镰，一曲唱遍了江南。
    果园满树的繁花谢去了，果园里浓绿一片，我笑历代的诗人们，常爱在这时悲叹。千颗万颗新果子，从绿叶间探出了头，同志们你们看呵，这是多好的时候！黄莺在唱第一支歌，枝头上露水很重，灿烂耀眼的阳光，是最忠实的园丁。我爱这片浓绿，它孕着无数美梦：谁不想在金色的秋天里，收获满树成熟的果子？
