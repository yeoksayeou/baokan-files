    Visiting the Lhasa "August 1st" Farm
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Si Yi
    The Lhasa "August 1st" Farm in June presents itself to the reporter like a mythical fairyland. From the farm, one can see the towering golden roof of the Potala Palace to the east, and the snow-capped peaks of the Gangdise Mountains to the west. On the banks of the Lhasa River, 3,600 meters above sea level, the spring scenery of Jiangnan is emerging: rows of broad-leaved willows sway in the wind, and patches of green vegetable seedlings cover the fields. Interspersed among them are high-yield experimental plots for planting wheat, highland barley, and various vegetables, glass greenhouses thriving with high-temperature crops such as watermelons, cantaloupes, tomatoes, and cucumbers, and apple orchards blooming with jade hairpin-like young leaves. From the vegetable plots, the labor songs of Tibetans or Han people float from time to time...

    In this major vegetable base for the troops stationed in Tibet, Han military workers and Tibetan agricultural workers are striving for a bumper harvest with full confidence on the six to seven hundred mu of vegetable land after the spring sowing, so as to supply sufficient fresh vegetables to the troops suppressing the rebellion in the Shannan area, the transportation troops along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and other troops stationed in the high-altitude areas. This farm is also an experimental field for cultivating various foreign vegetables on the plateau. The employees have worked hard to overcome the limitations of natural conditions such as short frost-free periods, low summer temperatures, and a soil thickness that is generally only thirty to fifty centimeters, and have successfully transplanted vegetables from all over the country here, gradually developing the vegetable varieties on the farm from only a few to the current forty-four kinds. Most of these vegetable varieties have never grown in Tibet before. Here, they have harvested "lotus cabbage" weighing forty-eight jin, radishes weighing forty jin, spinach weighing twelve jin, "thin gourd" pumpkins weighing forty-five jin, lettuce weighing six jin, and tomatoes weighing one jin and twelve taels each... These achievements have caused a sensation among the Tibetan compatriots near the farm. Whenever a new vegetable appears on the farm, the seeds of this vegetable not only quickly take root in the vegetable gardens of various agencies and troops, but are also cherished and scattered in their own gardens by Tibetan compatriots far and near.

    The "August 1st" Farm is one of the countless miracles created by the People's Liberation Army on the Tibetan plateau. This fertile land of fresh vegetables and sweet melons was once just a river beach overgrown with thorns and covered with rocks. In the winter of 1951, the People's Liberation Army, which had just entered Tibet, chose this place to establish a production base. Thousands of officers and soldiers erected tents on the frozen soil, wielded foreign shovels and picks, and worked hard to cut down thorns, remove stones, and dig soil, thus beginning the struggle to transform nature. When the second spring came, neat ridges and crisscrossing ditches appeared on the conquered river beach. The officers and soldiers collected scrap copper and iron from discarded military equipment, and used indigenous methods to forge thousands of agricultural tools such as plows, harrows, and hoes, and put them into spring plowing together with warhorses serving as draft animals. When fertilizer was needed, from the leading cadres of the military region to the soldiers of the company, everyone carried self-made wicker baskets, collected full baskets of manure fertilizer in the Lhasa city area, and walked to the reclamation area ten kilometers away, one trip after another, every day. On the "August 1st" Army Day of that year, just as the highland barley and vegetables sown for the first time on this land were expected to have a bumper harvest, a group of veteran soldiers were transferred here and formed the "August 1st" Farm. Over the years, it is these Han military workers who have devoted themselves to the construction of Tibet, together with the Tibetan agricultural workers who have successively joined the farm, who have used their hands to shape this corner of the Lhasa River valley into a beautiful Jiangnan.

    Many Tibetan workers came to work on the farm after leaving their hometowns because they could not endure the oppression of feudal lords. In February of last year, a Tibetan girl, named Tsering Lhamo, who was covered in a tattered piece of burlap that could not cover her buttocks and was as thin as skin and bones, came to the farm as a temporary worker. This nineteen-year-old girl had been working as a servant in the home of a noble in the Yambajan area since she was twelve years old, enduring hunger and cold every day, and being beaten and scolded. She spent seven years of slave life like this, and finally mustered the courage to escape from the hell on earth. Some kind-hearted poor Tibetans pointed her to the farm to find a way out. Later, the noble sent people to look for her three times, but no matter what threats or enticements were used, Tsering Lhamo's answer was always: "I would rather die than go back!" She finally maintained the freedom she had gained with the support of the farm staff. When I saw this girl, she had grown up to be rosy and plump, wearing a flowered dress.

    Many Tibetan workers have gradually mastered advanced farming techniques with the help of military workers, and have become formal agricultural workers from temporary workers. There are two Tibetan tractor drivers in the farm's mechanized farming team, one is the twenty-one-year-old Nyima Gonpo, who is still a bit childish, and the other is the young woman Lhamo, who used to study at Lhasa Elementary School. They only started learning to drive tractors in December last year, and now they are both able to drive independently and perform general maintenance work.

    Tibetan workers all love the farm's free labor and democratic life. There is a Tibetan worker named Jinzhu in the farm's transportation team. His father, under the instigation of reactionaries, repeatedly asked him to leave the farm to become a reactionary Tibetan army squad leader, but he firmly refused. When the reactionaries openly threatened him with death, he angrily replied: "Where there is the People's Liberation Army, there I will be!" Lhamo, the female tractor driver who is usually taciturn and blushes when she sees strangers, showed her valiant character of galloping on horseback on the grassland during the Lhasa rebellion. In order to resist the bandits, she quickly learned how to shoot. At that time, the Tibetan men and Han military workers on the farm took up arms together to patrol and stand guard, and together they blocked the fleeing bandits from Norbulingka. The Tibetan female workers participated in building fortifications and digging trenches, and actively learned first aid work.

    Between the farm and the nearby Tibetans, no matter how the reactionaries had provoked and incited in the past, they could not damage the close friendship of mutual support that had existed for a long time. Tibetans from as far away as Qushui and Deqingzong often came to the farm to learn vegetable cultivation techniques, and sometimes asked the farm to send people to provide specific guidance. Last year, the farm was short of more than 10,000 jin of pea and broad bean seeds, and the nearby Tibetans generously collected and lent them to the farm in full. During the spring plowing this year, the farm's tractors, pulling its own modified deep plows that could plow the soil fifty centimeters deep, arrived at Dazi County to provide free plowing services for the Tibetans. An old man in his eighties picked up the grass roots plowed out of the ground and excitedly said to the tractor drivers: "I have been plowing the land with yaks for decades, and I have never turned up the grass roots!"

    The Tibet Military Region has already achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables last year. In this regard, the successful experience of the "August 1st" Farm in transplanting vegetables on the plateau for many years has played an important role. The farm's employees have adopted methods such as adjusting the sowing and harvesting seasons of some vegetables according to the plateau climate characteristics, using hotbeds to cultivate seedlings to shorten the growth period of some vegetables, and giving full play to the role of greenhouses in the "City of Sunlight" that do not need to be heated all year round, so that the troops can eat various fresh vegetables all year round, and can also taste various melons.

    Now, this farm is developing into a comprehensive farm. The Han and Tibetan tractor drivers of the mechanized farming team are riding their "iron horses" and galloping happily on the more than 1,100 mu of land in Naiwu Creek on the south bank of the Lhasa River. This large area of land that has been dormant for thousands of years will become a granary for highland barley and wheat. The livestock farm is expanding its pigpens, breeding piglets hybridized from inland pigs and Tibetan pigs that can both fatten and adapt to the plateau climate. The cattle farm, which was established not long ago, is supplying fresh milk to the hospital every day. The hundreds of ducks that appeared on the plateau for the first time have recently moved from the mainland to the farm. The non-staple food processing plant is under construction on a large scale, and will soon produce products such as soy sauce, vinegar, tofu, and vermicelli. (Attached pictures)

    访拉萨“八一”农场
    新华社记者  周思义
    6月里的拉萨“八一”农场，像神话中的仙境展现在记者面前。在农场上，东望可见巍峨的布达拉宫金顶，西望有积雪的冈底斯山的峰巅。在这拔海三千六百公尺的拉萨河两岸，正出现着祖国江南的春色：成行的阔叶柳迎风摇曳，一畦畦翠绿的菜苗布满了原野。间杂其间的，有种植小麦、青稞和多种蔬菜的高产试验田，茁长着西瓜、哈密瓜、蕃茄、黄瓜等高温作物的玻璃温室，以及绽满了碧玉簪般嫩叶的苹果林。菜畦上不时地飘来藏语或汉语的劳动歌声……。
    在这个驻藏部队的主要蔬菜基地里，汉族军工和藏族农业工人们正满怀信心地在春播完毕的六七百亩菜地上，争取丰收，以便给山南地区平叛部队、青藏公路沿线运输部队，以及其他驻在高寒地区的部队供应充分的新鲜蔬菜。这个农场同时又是在高原上栽培各种外来蔬菜的试验场。职工们努力克服了无霜期短、夏季温度低、土壤厚度一般只有三五十公分等等自然条件的限制，成功地把祖国各地的蔬菜移植到这里，使农场里的蔬菜品种由寥寥几种逐渐发展到目前的四十四种。这些蔬菜品种大部分在西藏是从未生长过的。这里曾经收获过四十八斤重的“莲花白”、四十斤重的萝卜、十二斤重的菠菜、四十五斤重的“细葫芦”南瓜、六斤重的莴苣、一斤十二两一颗的蕃茄……。这些成就哄动了农场附近的藏族同胞。每当农场里出现一种新的蔬菜时，这种蔬菜的种子不仅很快在各个机关部队的菜圃里扎了根，而且也被远远近近的藏族同胞珍重地撒布在自己的园地里。
    “八一”农场是人民解放军在西藏高原上所创造的无数奇迹之一。这一片菜鲜瓜甜的富饶的土地，早先只是荆棘丛生，乱石遍地的河滩。1951年冬天，进藏不久的人民解放军选择了这个地方来建立生产基地。成千个官兵在冻土上支起帐篷，抡动洋锹、洋镐，奋力砍荆除棘，移石挖土，就这样开始了改造自然的斗争。当第二年春天来临的时候，被征服的河滩地上出现了整齐的田垅和纵横的沟渠。官兵们在报废的军事装备中捡来废铜铁，用土法锻铸了成千件犁、耙、锄头等农具，把它们同充当耕畜的战马一起投入了春耕。需要肥料时，从军区机关的领导干部到连队战士，人人背着自编的柳条筐，在拉萨市区收集满筐粪肥，每天一趟接一趟地徒步送到十公里外的垦区来。在这一年的“八一”建军节，正当这片土地上第一次播种的青稞和蔬菜丰收在望的时候，一批老战士被抽调到这里，组成了“八一”农场。连年来，就是这些献身于西藏建设事业的汉族军工，同陆续参加农场的藏族农业工人一起，用他们的双手，把这拉萨河谷的一角塑造成了锦绣江南。
    许多藏族工人都是由于无法忍受封建领主的压榨，才离乡背井前来农场工作的。去年2月间，一个披了一块遮不住屁股的破氆氇、瘦得皮包骨头的藏族姑娘，来到农场当临时工。这个十九岁的姑娘名叫茨朗拉莫，从十二岁起就在盐巴井地方的一个贵族家里当娃子，天天忍饥耐寒，挨打受骂，就这样度过了七年奴隶生活，最后鼓起勇气逃出了人间地狱，一些好心的贫苦藏胞指点她来农场找生路。后来，那个贵族三次派人前来找她，但不论威吓利诱，茨朗拉莫的每次回答都是：“我死也不回去！”她终于在农场职工的声援下，保持了已经获得的自由。当我见到这个姑娘的时候，她已经长得又红又胖，穿着一身花的衣服。
    许多藏族工人在军工们的帮助下，逐步掌握了先进的耕作技术，由临时工成为正式的农业工人。农场的机耕队里有两个藏族拖拉机手，一个是二十一岁的还带些稚气的尼西巩布，一个是曾在拉萨小学读书的女青年列娃。他们去年12月才开始学习驾驶拖拉机，现在都已经能够单独驾驶和进行一般保养工作。
    藏族工人们都热爱农场的自由劳动和民主生活。农场运输队里有个藏族工人金珠，他父亲在反动分子唆使下，曾经一再叫他脱离农场去当反动的藏军班长，但是都被他坚决拒绝。当反动分子公然用死亡来威胁他时，他愤怒地回答说：“有解放军就有我！”平时沉默寡言，见到生人就脸红的女拖拉机手列娃，在拉萨叛乱期间，曾显露出她那在草原上策马奔驰的骠悍性格，为了抗击叛匪，她很快学会了射击。那时候，农场里的藏族男子和汉族军工一起拿起武器巡逻放哨，一起堵击从罗布林卡溃散的叛匪。藏族女工们一面参加修工事，挖战壕，一面积极学习救护工作。
    在农场和附近的藏胞之间，尽管反动分子过去如何挑拨离间，并不能损害长时期以来互相支援的亲密友谊。远至曲水、德庆宗等地的藏胞们，时常来农场学习栽培蔬菜的技术，有时还请农场派人去具体指导。去年，农场缺一万多斤豌豆、蚕豆种子，附近的藏胞们慨然如数凑集起来借给了农场。今年春耕期间，农场的拖拉机曳引着自己改制的能犁土五十公分的深耕犁，到达孜宗给藏胞们免费耕种土地。一个八十多岁的老人捡起被犁出地面的草根，向拖拉机手们激动地说：“我用牦牛耕了几十年地，从不曾把草根翻出来过！”
    西藏军区在去年已经实现蔬菜自给。在这方面，“八一”农场多年来在高原上移植蔬菜的成功经验起了重要作用，农场职工按照高原气候特点，采取了调整一些蔬菜的播种和收获季节、利用温床育苗缩短一些蔬菜的生长期、充分发挥“日光城”里全年不用生火的温室的作用等等方法，使部队一年四季都能吃到各种新鲜蔬菜，还能尝到各种甜瓜。
    现在，这个农场正在向着综合性农场发展。机耕队汉、藏两族的拖拉机手们，正跨着“铁马”在拉萨河南岸乃乌溪地方的一千一百多亩土地上欢腾地驰骋，这一大片沉睡了千百年的土地将成为盛产青稞、小麦的粮仓。畜牧场正在扩建猪栏，里面繁殖着既能育肥、又能适应高原气候的内地猪和西藏猪杂交的猪仔。建立不久的养牛场，逐日把新鲜牛奶供给医院。高原上第一次出现的几百只鸭子，新近才从内地迁居到农场里。副食品加工厂正在大兴土木，即将生产酱油、醋、豆腐、粉条等产品。（附图片）
