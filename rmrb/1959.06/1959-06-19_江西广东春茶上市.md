According to statistics from seventeen key tea-producing counties in Guangdong Province, there are 7,203 mu of high-yield tea gardens, with a yield of 85 to 100 jin of dry tea per mu. The Phoenix People's Commune in Chao'an County has more than 90 mu of tea gardens, with an average yield of 300 jin per mu, an increase of 50% compared to the same period last year.

This year, the spring tea in both Jiangxi and Guangdong sprouted more and grew more evenly. In the rush to pick spring tea, all localities ensured timely harvesting.
