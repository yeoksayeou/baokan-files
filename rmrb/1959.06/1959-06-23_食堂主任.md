Mess Hall Director

Ying Xuan

This is a big village, and it's quite a walk from the village branch office to the Fourth Mess Hall. A boy of about ten years old was leading me to the mess hall. As we left the alley, the boy suddenly turned around, as if telling me something extremely secret, and solemnly whispered, "Uncle! You have to be careful when you eat at our mess hall! Hmph, if you're not careful and a tiny bit of bun crust falls on the ground, you'll get a scolding from Auntie Scar!" I was thinking about the situation of the increase production and economize movement that the branch secretary had just discussed with me, and didn't pay attention to what the boy said. But after walking a few steps, he turned around again and said, "Uncle, do you know why Auntie Scar is called Auntie Scar?" Then, without waiting for me to speak, he answered himself: "Because she has a scar on her forehead!"

Walking along, he suddenly turned around again and said, "Uncle! Do you know why Auntie Scar has a scar on her forehead?"

This talkative kid interrupted my thoughts several times. I became a little annoyed: "I'm not from your village, and I haven't seen any Auntie Scar or Uncle Scar, how would I know why she has a scar on her forehead!"

"I knew you wouldn't know!" My impolite answer didn't make the boy angry at all; on the contrary, he laughed triumphantly. He slowly approached me, took my hand, and began to talk endlessly: "My great-great-grandfather told me: she was a famous cook in the whole village, and anything she cooked was especially delicious. At that time, it was the old society, and her family farmed for the landlord 'Black Miser,' owing him rent, her husband was forced to death, and her children were sold off. Only she was left in the whole family. 'Black Miser' forced her to cook at his home as a servant. She was a poor person, of course, she was on the side of the poor! She secretly stole fine rice and white flour from the 'Black Miser's' house and distributed it to us poor people. When she cooked for the landlord, she deliberately made the food taste wrong, either too salty or too bland, wasting a lot of the landlord's food. Later, 'Black Miser' found out and gave her a severe beating. That's how she got the scar on her forehead. Later, she escaped from the 'Black Miser's' house and went far, far away to beg for a living. She only came back after the liberation! After that, everyone called her Auntie Scar!"

Auntie Scar's experience caught my attention, so I asked, "What does she do in the mess hall?"

"When the mess hall was set up last year, everyone unanimously chose her to cook. This spring, everyone elected her as the mess hall director!"

As we walked and talked, we arrived at the Fourth Mess Hall without realizing it. Under the dense shade of lush trees, a newly renovated green-tiled house stood tall. As soon as we entered the door, we smelled the tempting aroma of food.

In the middle of the spacious courtyard, there was a row of temporary sunshades. Under the sunshades, rows of small square dining tables were surrounded by commune members eating lunch. They were eating white bread and chive buns while chatting and laughing. The white walls were covered with red and green slogans and big-character posters. Some slogans read the poem: "...Sweat drips beneath the crops...Every grain is hard-earned"; others read "Mobilize and Save Food!" The big-character posters mostly praised or criticized specific individuals and units for saving or wasting food. The boy led me to an empty table under the sunshade (probably reserved for guests), ordered guest meals for me, and went to eat himself.

After a while, a person carrying a large tray brought me food: six large buns, a large plate of stir-fried green peppers, and a small plate of garlic-flavored toon sprouts. The person serving the food was an old woman in her fifties. She rolled up her sleeves, lifted her apron, and moved around steadily and neatly. On her sweaty face, there was a red scar on her forehead. She put down the tray, smiled, and said, "Comrade! Eat! The new wheat has been stored in the granary, this is the flour ground from our commune's new wheat. Try it while it's fresh!"

"Are you the mess hall director?" I asked.

"That's right. Everyone calls me Auntie Scar!" She smiled and walked towards the mess hall storage room, then suddenly turned back and said to me: "Be careful, don't drop food on the ground, leave what you can't finish in the bowl!"

People were full and were drinking tea and smoking, Auntie Scar came out of the storage room. She was holding a tray in her hand, which contained pieces of buns, crusts, broken pancakes, and bread crusts... She walked under the sunshade, held the tray high, and said: "Everyone, look at the things in this tray, I picked them up from various places in the mess hall yesterday. Alas! It hurts more to waste it than to eat it! ...It's true that our commune has a good wheat harvest; but we are all farmers for generations, and we all know how a good harvest comes about! When you eat, you should think: day and night, in the fields, how many people are blown by the wind and exposed to the sun, how many people have sweat-soaked clothes... I'm telling everyone, we must never allow this kind of bad thing to happen in our mess hall again!" After speaking, she went to the storage room with some anger.

After I finished eating, I walked around to take a look and walked to the storage room. I saw Auntie Scar quietly eating alone, drinking plain boiled water while chewing the scraps she had just taken out that people had left over. She was about to invite me to sit down when suddenly a young female cook rushed in, anxiously saying, "Auntie Scar, what should we do, Zhang Xiaozhu came back from the market and hasn't eaten, the buns have already been eaten up by everyone."

Auntie Scar, as if she had been prepared for this, stood up, unhurriedly, took out six large buns from a bamboo basket on the wall, and handed them to the cook, saying, "Quickly send these to him to eat."

The cook stood there blankly, holding the six buns: "These six are for you to eat, how can we give them to him!"

Auntie Scar smiled and said, "I'm already full!"

    食堂主任
    应选
    这是个大村，从村支部办公室到第四食堂去，要走一段路。领我到食堂去的是一个十多岁的孩子。我们走出胡同，领路的孩子突然回过头，像告诉我极为秘密的事情似的，郑重地低声说：“叔叔！到我们食堂吃饭，可得小心点呀！哼，你要是一不小心，丁点儿馒头皮子掉在地上，那你就得受疤大娘的数落了！”我脑子里正在考虑刚才支部书记向我谈的关于这里增产节约运动开展的情况，对孩子的话并没有注意。可是走了几步，他又回过头，说：“叔叔，你知道疤大娘为什么叫疤大娘吗？”接着，没等我开口，他又自己回答了：“因为她额角上有块疤呀！”
    走着走着，他又突然回过头，说：“叔叔！你知道疤大娘的额上为什么有疤吗？”
    这个多嘴的孩子，几次打断我的思路。我有些烦躁起来：“我不是你村人，又没见过什么疤大娘疤大爷的，我哪能知道她额上为什么有疤呀！”
    “我就知道你不知道！”我的不礼貌的回答不但不使这个孩子着恼，他反而得意地笑了起来。他慢慢靠近我，挽着我的手，滔滔不绝地讲开了：“俺四爷爷跟我讲过：她是全村出名的厨手，啥饭啥菜，一经她手，做的格外好吃。那工夫，是旧社会，她家给地主‘黑财迷’种地，欠下了‘黑财迷’的地租，丈夫给逼死了，孩子给逼卖了。全家只剩下她一个人。‘黑财迷’就逼她到家做饭做菜，当佣人。她是穷人嘛，当然和穷人一个心眼罗！她私下里把‘黑财迷’家的细米白面呀，偷出来，分给咱穷人吃。她给地主弄菜时，存心儿弄的不对味，不是咸，就是淡，糟踏了地主很多食物。后来‘黑财迷’知道了，狠狠地打了她一顿。她额上就这么留下了个疤。后来，她从‘黑财迷’家逃出来，到老远老远的地方要饭过活。直到解放后，才回来呀！这以后，大伙就管她叫疤大娘啦！”
    疤大娘的遭遇，引起我的注意了，便问：“她在食堂干嘛呀？”
    “去年办食堂，大伙同声儿选她到食堂办菜。今年春天，大伙又选她当食堂主任啦！”
    说着走着，不觉就到了第四食堂。在茂密的树丛的浓荫下，一幢刚刚修补过的青艳艳的瓦房耸立着。刚一进门，就嗅到了饭菜的诱人的香味。
    宽敞的庭院中间，搭着一排遮阳光的临时饭篷。饭篷下一列列方形的小饭桌，围坐着正在吃午饭的公社社员们。他们一边吃着白面包韭菜的大包子，一边谈笑着。四面洁白的墙壁上，贴满了红红绿绿的标语和大字报。标语上有的写着：“……汗滴禾下土……粒粒皆辛苦”的诗句；有的写着“动员起来，节约粮食！”大字报多是表扬或批评节约和浪费粮食的具体人物和单位的。孩子领我到饭篷下一个空无人坐的八仙桌旁坐下（这大概是专为客人们设的），给我要了客饭，自己就去吃饭去了。
    过了一会，一个人托着个大托盘，给我端来饭菜：六个大包子，一大盘炒青椒，一小盘香椿芽拌蒜。端饭菜的是个五十来岁的老大娘。她卷起衣袖，撩起围裙，走动起来，稳健利落。汗淋淋的脸上，额角有一块红红的疤痕。她放下盘子，笑了笑，说：“同志！吃吧！新麦入仓了，这是我们公社新麦磨的面。你尝尝鲜吧！”
    “你是食堂主任吗？”我问。
    “可不。大家都叫我疤大娘！”她笑着，往食堂保管室走去，又突然回过头，对我说：“精心点，别把食物丢在地上，吃不完留在碗里！”
    人们吃饱了，正在喝茶抽烟，疤大娘从保管室走出来了。手里托着盘子，盘子里放着一块块大大小小的馒头头子、卷卷头子、碎煎饼、面包头子……她走到饭篷下，把盘子举得高高的，说：“大伙瞧瞧，这盘子里的东西，是我昨天从食堂各处捡到的。哎！吃了不痛糟踏痛！……不错，咱公社小麦丰收了；可是咱们都是祖祖辈辈的庄户人，都知道丰收是怎样得来的呀！你吃东西的时候，该想一想：日日夜夜，在庄稼地里，有多少人被风吹日晒，有多少人汗水湿透了衣裳……告诉大伙说，今后绝不许我们食堂再出现这种坏事！”说罢，她带有几分气忿，往保管室去了。
    我吃罢饭，四处走着看看，信步走到了保管室去了。只见疤大娘一个人正在悄悄地吃饭，一边喝着白开水，一边细细地嚼着她刚才端出去的那盘人们吃剩下的碎头头。她正招呼我坐，突然一个青年女炊事员窜了进来，焦急地说：“疤大娘，你看怎么办呀，张小柱赶集回来，没吃饭，包子已经给大伙吃光了。”
    疤大娘像早就准备好了似的，站起来，不慌不忙，从墙上竹篮里拿出六个大包子，递到炊事员的手里，说：“快把这送给他吃吧。”
    炊事员呆站着，捧着六个包子：“这六个是留给你吃的呀，哪能给他！”
    疤大娘笑着说：“我早就吃饱啦！”
