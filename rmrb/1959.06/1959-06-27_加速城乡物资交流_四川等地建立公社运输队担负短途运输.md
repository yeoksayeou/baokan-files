Accelerating the Exchange of Goods Between Urban and Rural Areas
Sichuan and Other Places Establish Commune Transportation Teams to Undertake Short-Distance Transportation

(Our report) Chengdu – People's communes in various parts of Sichuan Province have universally established specialized transportation teams to ensure the timely collection and distribution of goods. At present, more than one million specialized transportation personnel in the province's people's communes serve industry, agriculture, and commerce, driving thousands of vehicles and boats, advancing by land and water, and connecting urban and rural areas and trunk and branch lines. They have become an indispensable force on the transportation lines.

The commune specialized transportation teams are the product of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the vigorous development of diversified operations in the communes throughout the province. This year, the total volume of goods transported in the province is expected to increase by nearly double compared to last year. Due to the accelerated circulation of goods between urban and rural areas and the increase in quantities, a tense situation emerged in short-distance transportation throughout the province from the beginning of the year. In order to solve the contradiction between large transportation volume and insufficient transportation capacity, people's communes in various places have successively established specialized transportation teams that focus on transportation and supplement agriculture, rushing to transport goods for the state and the communes, thus greatly changing the backward state of transportation in the province. Dazhou Prefecture, which ranks first in iron production in the province, used to have particularly tense short-distance collection and distribution transportation, with pig iron stockpiled and unable to be transferred to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company in a timely manner. Since February this year, after the people's communes in the prefecture organized a specialized transportation team of more than 90,000 people, the pig iron they transported to the water and land terminals has averaged about 1,000 tons per day, and now they have basically achieved daily production and daily transportation.

Will organizing specialized transportation teams in people's communes waste labor and affect agricultural production? The practice of communes throughout the province has proven that the labor productivity of specialized transportation teams is much higher than that of temporarily organizing the masses for shock transportation. At the same time, with regular transportation, temporary large-scale shock efforts can be reduced or avoided. This is beneficial to agricultural production. According to a survey conducted by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Transportation in the Tongxian District Central People's Commune in Anyue County, the commune's specialized transportation team now has 155 people, 96 carts, and 40 head of livestock. Human-powered carts can handle 192 tons of freight per month, and animal-powered carts can handle 211 tons, totaling 403 tons of goods transported in and out for the state and the commune each month, equivalent to 7,050 labor days when all manpower, tools, and livestock are converted. Due to the organization of a regular specialized transportation team, the construction of transportation facilities, and the improvement of transportation tools, the commune now uses this manpower and material resources to achieve "outsourcing of transportation, self-supply of needs," with no stockpiling of collected and distributed goods. If the old method of "ants moving a mountain" were used, mobilizing a large number of laborers to concentrate on rushing to transport this batch of goods in a period of time, with each person carrying 60 jin per trip, it would require more than 13,000 people and cost more than 53,600 labor days. Comparing the two, the specialized transportation team saves the commune more than 46,000 labor days.

The establishment of specialized transportation teams in communes not only meets the needs of the state and the communes themselves but can also increase the income of the communes. Some communes use transportation income to run other production undertakings, and some use it to subsidize the wages of commune members.

In order to strengthen collaboration and cooperation, all parts of the province have established commune specialized transportation management systems and reward methods in accordance with local conditions. The specialized transportation teams in various places are generally under the dual leadership of the county industrial and transportation bureau and the commune, accepting both the consignments within the commune and the transportation tasks assigned by the county under the principles of unified planning, unified scheduling, and unified freight rates. The county holds a transportation plan balancing meeting every month, allocating transportation volume based on the transportation capacity of the commune and contracting for completion. Each commune uniformly arranges transportation according to the principles of first external and then internal, first key points and then general. In order to ensure the completion of transportation tasks, the "five fixed" transportation system has been universally implemented in communes, that is, fixed lines, fixed points, fixed tools, fixed consumption, fixed time, and fixed tasks. In terms of wages and benefits, given that transportation personnel have more living expenses outside and greater labor intensity, the wage standards are slightly higher than those of agricultural production. People assigned to external transportation tasks are given a certain amount of living allowance per day.

(Our report) Wuhan, June 26th – Hong'an County, Hubei Province, has established people's commune specialized transportation teams, supplemented by sideline transportation teams. From late September last year to mid-June this year, they completed the transportation of 90,000 tons of goods. The Tanhe Management Area of ​​Qili People's Commune had more than one million jin of grain, peanuts, and local specialties stockpiled over the past two years. In April this year, the county transportation headquarters organized specialized transportation forces and spent a month transporting all the stockpiled goods.

Hong'an County is located in the Dabie Mountains, with inconvenient transportation. Due to the fact that transportation could not keep up with the needs of production development, a large amount of agricultural and sideline products such as grain, peanuts, and medicinal materials were stockpiled in the mountainous areas, and even deteriorated; while the daily necessities needed by the masses could not be transported in, and sometimes even table salt was out of stock. In order to change this situation, the Hong'an County Party Committee decided in September last year to establish specialized transportation teams in each people's commune to undertake the commune's year-round short-distance transportation and road maintenance tasks. At present, the eight people's commune specialized transportation teams in the county have a total of 1,175 people, with 15 horse-drawn carriages, 360 flatbed carts, 40 horses, 608 donkeys, and 288 handcarts, eliminating the need for carrying on shoulders and backs.

After the establishment of the commune specialized transportation teams (transportation personnel account for only 0.78% of the county's full and semi labor force), the phenomenon of transportation stagnation during busy farming seasons was changed, and agricultural production was not hindered by transportation. Last July, the county's drought resistance was very tense, and grain was out of stock in Chengguan Town. Because there was no specialized transportation team, more than 600 people had to be drawn from the drought resistance labor force to rush to transport grain, which affected drought resistance. During the spring plowing and production this year, the ration grain and peanut seeds in the Bali People's Commune were out of stock. The commune's transportation team rushed to transport more than 800,000 jin of grain and peanut seeds from Xiongjiawan and other places 25 li away in more than 20 days, ensuring the supply of rations and seeds and supporting spring plowing production. The establishment of specialized transportation teams eliminated the phenomenon of cars waiting for goods and running empty, and the daily mileage of cars increased from 100 kilometers to 200 kilometers. In addition, it also increased the income of the commune. Since September last year, the total income of the county's commune transportation teams has reached more than 230,000 yuan.

The management areas of the people's communes in Hong'an County have also organized transportation teams that are both transporters and farmers, composed of commune members with transportation experience drawn from the production teams. They usually participate in agricultural production and cooperate with the specialized teams to complete urgent transportation tasks when needed.

The Panshi loading and unloading station of the Baixiang People's Commune in Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province, is a specialized transportation organization run by the commune management area. The employees of this station have greatly improved tools and basically eliminated the heavy physical labor of carrying on shoulders and backs. This is them using self-designed and self-made wooden-wheeled and wooden-axled handcarts to transport things.

### 加速城乡物资交流  四川等地建立公社运输队担负短途运输

    加速城乡物资交流
    四川等地建立公社运输队担负短途运输
    本报讯　四川省各地人民公社普遍建立专业运输队，保证物资及时集散。目前，全省人民公社为工业、农业、商业服务的一百多万专业运输大军，驾着千车万船，水陆并进，沟通城乡和干线支线之间的运输。他们已经成为交通线上的一支不可缺少的力量。
    公社专业运输队是全省工农业生产大跃进和公社多种经营大发展的产物。今年全省物资总运量预计比去年增加将近一倍。由于城乡物资流通加速，数量增加，从年初开始，全省短途运输就出现了紧张局面。为了解决运量大、运力不足的矛盾，各地人民公社相继建立了以运为主、以农为辅的专业运输队，为国家为公社赶运物资，因而大大改变了全省运输的落后面貌。全省产铁居首位的达县专区，过去短途集散运输特别紧张，生铁积压，不能及时调给重庆钢铁公司。自从今年2月全区人民公社组织了九万多人的专业运输队以后，他们运到水、陆码头的生铁，每天平均保持在一千吨左右，现在基本上做到了日产日运。
    人民公社组织专业运输队，会不会浪费劳动力、影响农业生产？全省各公社的实践证明，专业运输队的劳动生产率，比临时组织群众进行突击运输要高得多。同时，有了经常性的运输，也可以减少或避免临时性的大突击。这对农业生产是有利的。根据四川省交通厅在安岳县通贤区中心人民公社的调查，这个社专业运输队现有一百五十五人，九十六辆架车和四十头牲畜，人力架车每月能担负一百九十二吨的运量，人畜力车担负二百一十一吨，共计每月可为国家和公社运进运出物资四百零三吨，按全部人力、工具、牲畜折合为七千零五十个劳动日。由于组织了经常性的专业运输队，进行了交通建设，改进了运输工具，公社现在运用这批人力物力，做到“外调包运、自需自运”，集散物资毫无积压。如果用过去“蚂蚁搬泰山”的办法，在一段时间内，动员大批劳动力集中突击赶运这批物资，每人每次挑运六十斤，则需要一万三千多人，花五万三千六百多个劳动日。两相比较，专业运输队为公社节约了四万六千多个劳动日。
    公社建立专业运输队，不仅满足了国家和公社本身的需要，还可以给公社增加收入。有的公社靠运输收入兴办其它生产事业，有的辅助支付社员的工资。
    为了加强协作配合，全省各地都因地制宜地建立了公社专业运输管理制度和奖励办法。各地专业运输队一般都在县工业交通局和公社的双重领导下，既接受公社内部的托运，又在统一计划、统一调度、统一运价的原则下，接受县里分配的运输任务。县每月召开运输计划平衡会议，根据公社运输能力，分配运量，包干完成。各公社根据先外后内、先重点后一般的原则，统一安排运输。为了确保运输任务的完成，各地公社还普遍实行了五定运输制度，即定线定点、定工具、定消耗、定时间、定任务。在工资福利方面，各地鉴于运输人员在外生活开支较多，劳动强度较大，因此工资待遇采取了略高于农业生产的标准。对担任外调运输任务的人员，每人每天发给一定的生活补助金。
    本报武汉26日电　湖北省红安县建立人民公社专业运输队，并辅以副业运输队，从去年9月下旬至今年6月中旬，共完成了九万吨物资的运输任务。七里人民公社谭和管理区两年来积压粮食、花生和土特产达一百多万斤，今年4月，县运输指挥部组织专业运输力量，用一个月的时间就把积压物资全部运了出来。
    红安县地处大别山区，交通不便。由于交通运输跟不上生产发展的需要，造成山区大量的粮食、花生和药材等农副产品的积压，甚至损坏变质；而群众需要的日用物资却运不进去，甚至有时连食盐也脱销。为了改变这种状况，中共红安县委在去年9月就决定在各人民公社成立专业运输队，担负公社常年短途运输和养路任务。目前，全县八个人民公社专业运输队，共有一千一百七十五人，拥有马车十五辆，板车三百六十辆，马四十匹，驮驴六百零八匹，红车二百八十八辆，消灭了肩挑背驮。
    公社专业运输队（运输人员只占全县整、半劳动力的0.78％）建立以后，改变了过去农忙期间运输停滞的现象，同时也不因运输而妨碍农忙生产。去年7月这个县抗旱很紧张，城关镇粮食脱销。因为没有专业运输队，不得不从抗旱的劳动力中抽出六百多人去突击运粮，影响了抗旱。今年春耕大生产时，八里人民公社口粮和花生种脱销，公社运输队突击赶运二十多天，从二十五里以外的熊家湾等地运来了粮食和花生种八十多万斤，保证了口粮和种子的供应，支援了春耕生产。专业运输队的建立，消灭了汽车等货和跑空车的现象，汽车日行里程由一百公里提高到二百公里。另外，还增加了公社收入。从去年9月以来，全县公社运输队收入共达二十三万多元。
    红安县各人民公社管理区还组织了亦运亦农的运输队，由生产队抽调有运输经验的社员组成，平时参加农业生产，遇有紧急运输任务便配合专业队去完成。
