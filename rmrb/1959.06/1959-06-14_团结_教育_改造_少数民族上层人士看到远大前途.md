Unity, Education, Transformation
Upper-Class Ethnic Minorities See a Bright Future

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since liberation, the Party has consistently adopted a policy of unity, education, and transformation towards the upper-class ethnic minorities in Yunnan's border regions, including Tusi (local chieftains), subordinate officials, mountain officials, and princes. In the establishment of governments at all levels and the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy, their representatives have been gradually absorbed into work. Many of them have already served as governors of autonomous prefectures, county heads, district heads, and members of people's committees. Some have been elected as representatives to the National People's Congress and provincial people's congresses. In addition to uniting, educating, and transforming upper-class ethnic minorities in practical work, the Party has also established a special political research class at Yunnan Nationalities Institute, organizing upper-class ethnic minorities to participate in learning. Furthermore, they have been organized to visit Kunming, Beijing, and other regions of the country, enabling many upper-class figures to see the greatness of the motherland and the bright future of their ethnic group within the great family of the motherland, as well as to recognize that the feudal exploitation system is detrimental to the development of the ethnic group.

    Through several years of work, coupled with the peaceful consultation approach adopted during the land reform in the border regions, which implemented a redemption policy similar to that for the national bourgeoisie towards the upper-class ethnic minorities, providing political positions and care in their lives, the majority of them, at the request of the masses, have agreed to democratic reform. However, at that time, many people doubted whether the Party would continue to unite with them after the completion of democratic reform and the improvement of mass awareness. The facts after the reform dispelled their doubts. In addition to the fact that the political status of the upper-class ethnic minorities who had originally participated in work was not lowered, local areas also expanded the consultation mechanism after the land reform, absorbing more representatives from the upper-class ethnic minorities to participate in work, increasing from more than 500 before the reform to more than 1,000. Upper-class ethnic minorities who experienced difficulties in life after the reform due to giving up exploitation were given regular and irregular subsidies by the state. Upper-class ethnic minorities residing in rural areas who did not participate in work were given the same amount of land as farmers during the land reform, and their housing and other means of living were protected, and they still enjoyed the political rights of citizens. The Party's sincere unity, care, and concern for the upper-class ethnic minorities has made more and more upper-class figures realize that the elimination of the feudal lord system in the border regions and their abandonment of exploitation has a bright future.

    The cause of socialist construction is flourishing, but the thinking of a considerable number of upper-class ethnic minorities is still far behind this situation. Therefore, after the realization of democratic reform, strengthening the education and transformation of upper-class ethnic minorities remains a very arduous task. Party committees at all levels in Yunnan Province have paid attention to strengthening this work after the land reform. After the land reform, various places in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture established Socialist Construction Learning Committees, regularly organizing upper-class ethnic minorities to study. In August last year, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China also convened nearly 300 upper-class ethnic minorities working in leadership positions in the border regions to systematically study documents on building socialism in Kunming.

    Through this series of work, many upper-class ethnic minorities have undergone varying degrees of transformation. Some have expressed their desire to be a true state organ cadre; others have expressed their desire to work hard together with the masses of their ethnic group and contribute to the cause of socialist construction.

    团结　教育　改造
    少数民族上层人士看到远大前途
    本报讯　解放以来，党对云南边疆的少数民族上层人士土司、属官、山官、王子等一直采取了团结、教育、改造的方针。在建立各级政权和实行民族区域自治中，逐步吸收他们的代表人物参加工作。其中不少人已经担任了自治州的州长、县长、区长和人民委员，有的被选为全国和省人民代表大会的代表。党除在实际工作中对民族上层人士进行团结教育改造以外，还在云南民族学院专门设置了一个政治研究班，先后组织少数民族上层人士参加学习；另外，组织他们到昆明、北京和全国其他地区参观，使许多上层人士看到祖国的伟大和本民族在祖国大家庭中的远大前途，看到封建剥削制度不利于民族的发展。
    经过几年来的工作，加上边疆进行土地改革时采取了和平协商的方针，对民族上层实行了类似对民族资产阶级的赎买政策，在政治上安排地位，在生活上给予照顾，在群众的要求下，大部人都赞成进行民主改革。但是，当时也有不少人怀疑：在完成了民主改革、群众觉悟提高以后，党是不是继续团结他们。改革以后的事实打消了他们的疑团。除原来参加工作的民族上层人士的政治地位没有降低以外，各地在土地改革以后还扩大了协商机构，更多地吸收民族上层中的代表人物参加工作，由改革以前的五百多人增加到一千多人。民族上层人士在改革以后因放弃剥削而生活发生困难的，都由国家给以定期和不定期的补助。居住在农村没有参加工作的民族上层人士，在土地改革时都给予和农民一样多的田地，住宅和其他生活资料一律受到保护，依然享有公民的政治权利。党对民族上层人士的这种真诚团结和照顾关怀，使越来越多的上层人士认识到，边疆消灭了封建领主制度，自己放弃剥削以后，是有光明前途的。
    社会主义建设事业正蓬勃开展，而相当多的民族上层人士的思想，却还远远落后于这种形势，因此实现民主改革以后，加强对民族上层人士的教育改造工作仍然非常艰巨。云南省各级党委在土地改革后都注意加强了这项工作。西双版纳傣族自治州各地在土地改革以后，成立了社会主义建设学习委员会，定期组织民族上层人士学习。去年8月份，中共云南省委还召集近三百名在边疆担任领导工作的民族上层人士在昆明系统地学习了关于建设社会主义的文件。
    经过这一系列的工作，许多民族上层人士都得到程度不同的改造，有的表示要作一个名副其实的国家机关干部；有的表示要同本民族群众一道苦干，为社会主义建设事业贡献一分力量。
