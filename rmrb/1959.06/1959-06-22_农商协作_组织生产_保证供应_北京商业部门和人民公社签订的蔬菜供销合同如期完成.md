Agricultural and Commercial Collaboration, Organizing Production, Ensuring Supply
Beijing Commercial Departments and People's Communes Complete Vegetable Supply Contracts as Scheduled

This newspaper reports that the vegetable and other supply contracts signed this year between the People's Communes in the suburbs of Beijing and the commercial departments, stipulating what should be achieved within the past five months, have been completed as scheduled.

The fulfillment of the contracts, in addition to the efforts of the members of the People's Communes in the suburbs, is also due to a very important reason. The commercial departments in Beijing, with the assistance of the agricultural and forestry departments, have adopted a proactive attitude towards the signed contracts, specifically guiding production and arranging market schedules, and at the same time helping them solve many specific problems in production within the realm of possibility.

There were more than 600 cadres from the commercial and agricultural and forestry departments sent to the People's Communes. More than 70 cadres engaged in vegetable management, after residing in the communes, under the leadership of the district party committees and commune party committees, helped the People's Communes specifically arrange vegetable planting plans according to contract stipulations and market needs, so that more fast-maturing vegetables were planted in the near suburbs, and more storable and transportable potatoes, radishes, etc. were planted in the far suburbs, and planting was staggered to stagger the marketing time, thus greatly strengthening the planning of vegetable production and market supply. In addition, some cadres from the commercial and agricultural and forestry departments frequently went to the People's Communes to guide livestock and poultry production. With their assistance, most communes established specialized teams for non-staple food production, improved livestock breeding management methods, and established a production responsibility system and reward system.

This group of resident cadres also promptly discovered and actively helped solve difficulties and problems in production by participating in production meetings and fieldwork. For example, in the development of non-staple food production, some People's Communes did not have enough technical strength, and they reported this situation to higher authorities. The commercial and agricultural and forestry departments sent technicians to the communes to guide production, and at the same time trained a large number of technicians for the People's Communes. Since the beginning of this year, more than 200 production specialists and veterinarians in pig raising, chicken raising, and fish farming have been trained for various People's Communes through short-term professional training classes alone. In addition, the commercial departments also collaborated with relevant production departments in various districts to exchange experience in managing livestock production through on-site meetings, visits, and internships. Currently, about half of the suitable female livestock in the entire suburban area have been bred. Many communes without collective chick-raising experience used to have very low chick survival rates. The commercial departments organized chicken farmers to learn from the Laoyeshan Chicken Farm. Now the chick survival rate in these communes generally reaches about 80%.

Because resident cadres were sent and the situation was understood in a timely manner, promoting the production and purchase of vegetables and non-staple foods was also more timely. The commercial departments promptly supplied agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, seeds and other means of production to the People's Communes, and also prepared in advance to build chicken hatcheries to hatch chicks, purchased more than 40 million fish fry from other places, and promptly supported the People's Communes in developing non-staple food production. This year, the commercial departments also fully exploited all usable by-products in the urban food processing industry, such as urban tofu dregs, soy sauce residue, and distiller's grains, to supply the People's Communes as feed. In April and May alone, more than 3 million catties of pig feed were supplied to various People's Communes. In terms of purchasing, in view of the shortage of labor in the People's Communes, the commercial departments not only adopted the method of collecting pigs in the pens and collecting eggs in the courtyards, but also organized commercial personnel to help the communes harvest vegetables.

    农商协作  组织生产  保证供应
    北京商业部门和人民公社签订的蔬菜供销合同如期完成
    本报讯　今年北京市郊区人民公社和商业部门签订的有关蔬菜等供销合同，规定在过去五个月内应该实现的已经如期实现。
    合同的实现，除了郊区人民公社社员的努力以外，另一个很重要的原因，是北京市商业部门在农林部门协助下，对所签订的合同采取了积极的主动态度，具体地指导生产和安排上市计划，同时在可能范围内，帮助他们解决生产中的许多具体问题。
    商业部门和农林部门派到人民公社去的干部共有六百多人。七十多名经营蔬菜的干部住社以后，在区委和公社党委的领导下，根据合同规定和市场需要，帮助人民公社具体安排了蔬菜播种计划，使近郊区多种了一些快熟蔬菜，远郊区多种了一些耐储存耐运输的土豆、萝卜等，并且分期播种，排开上市，这样就大大加强了蔬菜生产和市场供应的计划性。另外一些商业和农林部门的干部，经常到人民公社指导畜牧、家禽生产。在他们协助下，多数公社都成立了副食品生产专业队，改进了畜牧饲养管理方法，并建立了生产责任制和奖励制度。
    这批住社干部还通过参加生产会议和田间劳动，及时发现和积极帮助解决生产中的困难和问题。如发展副食品生产中，有些人民公社的技术力量不够，他们就把这种情况向上级作了反映。商业部门和农林部门就派了技术人员到公社指导生产，同时为人民公社培养了不少技术人员。今年以来，仅通过短期专业训练班的方法，就给各人民公社训练了养猪、养鸡、养鱼等生产专业人员和兽医人员二百多人。此外，商业部门还协同各区有关生产部门以召开现场会议、参观、实习等方式交流了管理畜牧生产的经验。现在全郊区半数左右适殖的母牲畜都配了种。没有集体养小鸡经验的许多公社，过去养的小鸡成活率很低，商业部门就组织养鸡人员到老爷山养鸡厂学习了经验，现在这些公社的小鸡成活率一般达到了80％左右。
    由于派了住社干部，了解情况及时，因此，在促进蔬菜和副食品的生产以及收购方面也更及时了。商业部门曾把农业机械、化学肥料和种籽等生产资料及时供应给人民公社，还提前筹办孵化鸡厂孵化小鸡，外地购进四千多万尾鱼苗，及时支持了人民公社发展副食品生产。商业部门今年还充分挖掘城市食品加工业中一切可以利用的副产物，例如城市的豆腐渣、酱油渣、酒糟等供应人民公社作饲料，仅4、5两个月就给各人民公社供应了三百多万斤养猪饲料。在收购方面，根据人民公社劳动力不足的情况，商业部门除采取了收猪到圈、收蛋到院的方法，并且组织商业人员到公社帮助收割蔬菜。
