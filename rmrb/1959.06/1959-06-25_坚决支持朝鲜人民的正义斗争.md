    Resolutely Support the Just Struggle of the Korean People
    Yang Yong
    The ninth anniversary of the heroic Korean people's struggle against American aggression – "June 25th" – has arrived. Nine years ago today, the American imperialists and their lackey, Syngman Rhee, launched a war of aggression against Korea. At the time, they were confident that, with their military superiority, they could easily open a gap in the eastern part of the socialist camp. However, things turned out exactly the opposite of what they had hoped. After three years and one month of heroic and arduous fighting, the Korean and Chinese people finally drove the aggressors back to where they had started the war, forcing the United States to sign the armistice agreement and admit defeat. The myth of American invincibility was shattered. The American paper tiger revealed its true form. And the eastern part of the socialist camp is stronger than ever. Today, as we commemorate "June 25th," we look back on this great victory achieved by the Korean and Chinese people and are deeply proud of it. The history of the past nine years has powerfully demonstrated to the world that the Korean and Chinese people are invincible. The days of imperialism running rampant in the world are gone forever.
    As we welcome "June 25th," we will never forget that "June 25th" is a day stained with blood. The flames of war ignited by the American aggressors in Korea nine years ago brought unprecedented disasters and suffering to the Korean people. During the three years and one month of the war, almost all the cities and villages in northern Korea were bombed into rubble, more than two million innocent civilians were brutally murdered, and countless residents of northern Korea were abducted to South Korea. While invading Korea, the American aggressors also occupied our country's Taiwan; brought the flames of war to the Yalu River, bombing our towns and cities and killing our compatriots. Although the American aggressors have already reaped the bitter fruit of this war, the Korean and Chinese people will never forget the blood debt owed by the aggressors. We must always remember the wolfish face of American imperialism and will spare no effort to defend the fruits of victory we have achieved at such a great price.
    What makes us feel particularly indignant is that the American imperialists' crimes of obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue have not only not changed in the slightest to this day, but have instead intensified. Over the past nine years, the Korean and Chinese people have made extremely great efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, which is a fact that the people of the world have witnessed. However, during this period, the American aggressors have exhausted shameless tricks such as perfidy, unreasonableness, wanton provocation, and conspiracy and sabotage. As far as the situation after the armistice is concerned, the Korean and Chinese sides have repeatedly proposed unifying Korea peacefully and have actively created conditions for this. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly proposed consultations between political parties, social organizations, and individuals in North and South Korea, the establishment of political, economic, and cultural ties between North and South Korea, the supply of electricity to South Korea, the supply of relief grain to disaster victims in South Korea, and the reduction of military forces in both North and South Korea to 100,000 or fewer each. In 1956, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea unilaterally reduced its military strength by 80,000. From September 1954 to October 1955, the Chinese People's Volunteers successively withdrew 19 divisions from Korea on their own initiative. However, the American imperialists and their running dog, Syngman Rhee, responded to the sincere efforts of the Korean and Chinese people with a series of destructive actions. Before the ink on the armistice agreement was dry, the U.S. government signed the "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" with Syngman Rhee, preparing for the long-term occupation of South Korea by American troops; then, it sabotaged the convening of the political conference; wantonly obstructed the repatriation rights of prisoners of war on the Korean and Chinese side; obstructed and sabotaged the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and unilaterally announced and forced the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw from South Korea in May 1956; In June 1957, the United States unilaterally announced the abolition of Paragraph 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and immediately transported new weapons such as atomic cannons and "Honest John" missiles into South Korea; moved the notorious "United Nations Command" to South Korea, reorganized the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea into atomic divisions; and expanded Syngman Rhee's army from 16 divisions at the time of the armistice to 31 divisions. Since January of last year, the American army has even conducted a series of provocative atomic exercises near the military demarcation line and along the east coast of South Korea, including "the largest atomic war exercise since the armistice" involving 50,000 people.
    In order to further break the deadlock in the Korean issue, the governments of China and North Korea decided in February of last year to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea and put forward a peaceful initiative for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the implementation of free elections throughout Korea. However, after the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea in October of last year, the American imperialists not only insisted on refusing to withdraw their troops from South Korea, but also more brazenly carried out a series of violations of the armistice agreement. American planes and U.S.-Rhee agents constantly crossed the military demarcation line to carry out hostile activities, and the United States transported "Matador" missiles into South Korea and expanded missile bases in South Korea. Since January of this year, the American imperialists have colluded with the Syngman Rhee clique to sell people under the guise of "immigration," selling residents abducted from northern Korea during the war and retired soldiers of the Syngman Rhee army to foreign capitalists and farmers as slaves.
    This series of crimes committed by the American imperialists in sabotaging the armistice agreement and obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea has been resolutely opposed by the Korean and Chinese people. The bellicose face of the American imperialists, who refuse to ease tensions and deliberately threaten peace in Asia and the world, has been more thoroughly exposed to the people of the world. The fact that the American army is staying in South Korea is a hotbed for a new war in Asia and is the mortal enemy of the Korean people and the peaceful reunification of Korea is perfectly clear! As the resolution of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council on the Korean issue in February of this year pointed out: "The fact that American troops are still stationed in South Korea in violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and are establishing and continuously expanding their atomic bases and missile bases in South Korea, is a serious threat to peace in Korea, Asia, and the world." This is the righteous voice of the Afro-Asian people. Yes, as long as the American army does not withdraw from South Korea, the fundamental obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea cannot be removed for a single day, and there is no guarantee of peace in the East.
    As everyone knows, the Chinese People's Volunteers crossed the Yalu River more than eight years ago to fight side by side with the Korean people in order to save peace. Last year, the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea, also in order to break the deadlock created by the United States in the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. After the Volunteers withdrew from Korea, the Volunteers' representatives remained in the Korean Military Armistice Commission, also to continue to supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement together with the representatives of the Korean People's Army, to seek an early peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and to hope that the armistice state would be transformed into a lasting peace as soon as possible. This wish of the Chinese People's Volunteers is a reflection of the Chinese people's love of peace. We must not tolerate the American imperialists turning a blind eye to the wishes of our people, the Afro-Asian people, and the people of the world for the early realization of peaceful reunification in Korea and acting perversely.
    We firmly believe that the Korean people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory. This struggle of the Korean people has been increasingly supported by the people of the world. The strength of the Korean people demanding the reunification of their motherland has grown rapidly in the six years since the war. The democratic base in northern Korea, which has undergone the severe test of war, has not only been rebuilt from the ruins under the diligent construction of the heroic Korean people in the six years after the war and with the support of the countries of the socialist camp, but has also embarked on the Chollima of socialist construction and achieved brilliant achievements, becoming more consolidated than ever before. The level of industrial and agricultural production in northern Korea has long surpassed the pre-war level, the first five-year plan after the war will be completed ahead of schedule, the historical task of agricultural cooperation has been successfully completed, the people's living standards have been significantly improved, and the entire people are bravely advancing towards the goal of building a developed socialist industrial country in a few years. Every achievement of the Korean people's socialist construction marks the rapid growth of the northern democratic base and encourages the Korean people to fight more stubbornly for the reunification of their motherland. The prosperity of northern Korea stands in stark contrast to the abyss of unemployment, hunger, and disease in which the people of South Korea have fallen. From their own pain, the people of South Korea are increasingly aware that the long-term occupation of South Korea by the American army is the fundamental cause of the artificial division of the Korean people. Their desire for the American army to withdraw from South Korea is growing stronger; the movement against the occupation of South Korea by the American army and against Syngman Rhee's traitorous policy is developing and growing stronger. The vigorous construction enthusiasm and the booming prosperity of the people of northern Korea further encourage their fighting spirit, and the popular sentiment towards the north has become an irresistible torrent.
    The situation is becoming increasingly clear. It will not work for the American aggressors to rely on South Korea for a long time under the banner of the United Nations. As in the past, the Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the Korean people. Let us, the Korean and Chinese people, continue to join hands and resolutely fight for the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and the consolidation of peace in the Far East! Victory will surely belong to the heroic and indomitable Korean people.

    坚决支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争
    杨勇
    英雄的朝鲜人民反对美国侵略斗争九周年纪念日——“六·二五”来到了。九年前的今天，美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚，发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。当时，他们满以为凭借军事优势，可以轻易地在社会主义阵营的东方打开一个缺口。但是，事情恰恰走向了他们希望的反面。朝中人民经过三年零一个月的英勇卓绝的战斗，终于把侵略者打回到他发动战争的地方，迫使美国在停战协定上签字认输。美国不可战胜的神话破灭了。美国纸老虎现了原形。而社会主义阵营的东方比过去任何时候都更为坚强了。今天，当我们纪念“六·二五”的时候，我们回顾朝中人民取得的这一伟大胜利，深深地引为自豪。九年来的历史，向人们有力地显示出：朝中人民是不可战胜的。帝国主义在世界上横行无忌的日子已经一去不返。
    在迎接“六·二五”的时候，我们决不会忘记：“六·二五”是个血迹斑斑的日子。美国侵略者九年前在朝鲜烧起的战火，给朝鲜人民带来了空前的灾难和痛苦。三年零一个月的战争中，朝鲜北部所有的城市村庄几乎都被炸成一片瓦砾，二百多万无辜和平居民惨遭残杀，无数朝鲜北部居民被劫往南朝鲜。美国侵略者在侵略朝鲜的同时，还霸占了我国的台湾；把战火烧到鸭绿江边，炸我城镇；杀我同胞。尽管美国侵略者在这场战争中已经自食其果，但朝中人民对侵略者欠下的这笔血债，是永远不会忘记的。我们要永远记住美帝国主义的豺狼面目，并且将不吝惜一切地来保卫我们付出了巨大代价而取得的胜利果实。
    特别使我们感到无比愤慨的，就是迄今为止，美帝国主义百般阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的罪行，不仅没有丝毫改变，相反地却变本加厉。过去的九年间，朝中人民为谋求和平解决朝鲜问题作了极其巨大的努力，这是世界人民有目共睹的事实。而美国侵略者在这期间却耍尽了背信弃义、蛮不讲理、放肆挑衅、阴谋破坏等无耻伎俩。就停战以后的情况而言，朝中方面曾一再建议用和平的方式统一朝鲜，并积极为此创造条件。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国曾多次提出南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体以及个别人士之间进行协商，南北朝鲜之间建立政治、经济、文化联系，给南朝鲜供应电力，给南朝鲜灾民供给救济粮以及把南北朝鲜的兵力各裁减到十万或十万以下等公平合理的建议。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国1956年单方面裁减兵力八万人。中国人民志愿军于1954年9月至1955年10月，先后从朝鲜主动撤出十九个师。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚，却以一系列的破坏行为来回答朝中人民的真诚努力。停战协定墨迹未干，美国政府就和李承晚签订了“美韩共同防御协定”，为美国军队长期霸占南朝鲜作了准备；接着，又破坏了政治会议的召开；蛮横地阻挠朝中方面被俘人员行使遣返权利；阻挠和破坏中立国视察小组的工作，1956年5月片面宣布并强迫中立国视察小组撤出南朝鲜；1957年6月，美国又片面宣布废除朝鲜停战协定十三款卯项，随即把原子炮和“诚实的约翰”等新式武器运进南朝鲜；将臭名昭著的“联合国军司令部”迁入南朝鲜，改编驻扎在南朝鲜的美军为原子师；将李承晚军队由停战时的十六个师扩充至三十一个师。去年1月以后，美国军队甚至在军事分界线附近和南朝鲜的东海岸一带，举行了一系列的挑衅性的原子演习，其中包括有五万人参加的“停战以后最大的一次原子战争演习”。
    朝中两国政府为进一步打开朝鲜问题的僵局，去年2月决定从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军，提出了一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，实行全朝鲜自由选举的和平倡议。但在中国人民志愿军于去年10月全部撤出朝鲜以后，美帝国主义不仅坚持拒绝从南朝鲜撤军，而且对停战协定更放肆地进行了一系列的破坏。美国飞机和美李特务不断越过军事分界线进行敌对活动，美国并把“斗牛士”式导弹运进南朝鲜，在南朝鲜扩建导弹基地。今年1月以来，美帝国主义更和李承晚集团勾结起来，以“移民”为幌子，贩卖人口；把他们战时从朝鲜北部劫走的居民和李承晚军队的退伍人员，卖给外国资本家和农场主作奴隶。
    美帝国主义这一系列破坏停战协定，阻挠朝鲜和平统一的罪行，遭到了朝中人民的坚决反对。美帝国主义拒绝和缓紧张局势，蓄意威胁亚洲和世界和平的好战面目，在全世界人民面前更彻底地暴露了。美国军队赖在南朝鲜不走是亚洲新战争的温床，是朝鲜人民和朝鲜和平统一的死敌，这一事实是再清楚不过了！正如亚非人民团结理事会今年2月关于朝鲜问题的决议所指出的：“美国军队违反朝鲜停战协定，仍然驻在南朝鲜，并且建立和不断扩大它在南朝鲜的原子基地和导弹基地，这是对朝鲜、亚洲和世界和平的严重威胁”。这是亚非人民正义的呼声。是的，美国军队一天不撤出南朝鲜，横在朝鲜和平统一大道上的根本障碍就一天无法清除，东方的和平就没有保障。
    众所周知，中国人民志愿军八年多以前跨过鸭绿江和朝鲜人民并肩作战，是为了拯救和平。去年，中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜，也是为了打开美国在和平解决朝鲜问题上所造成的僵局。志愿军撤出朝鲜以后在朝鲜军事停战委员会内留有志愿军代表，也是为了和朝鲜人民军代表一道，继续监督朝鲜停战协定的实施，谋求朝鲜问题早日和平解决，希望停战状态早日转变为持久的和平。中国人民志愿军的这一愿望是六亿中国人民热爱和平的反映。我们决不能容忍美帝国主义无视我国人民、亚非人民以及全世界人民盼望朝鲜早日实现和平统一的愿望而倒行逆施。
    我们坚信，朝鲜人民为统一祖国而进行的斗争一定会得到最后胜利。朝鲜人民的这一斗争已愈来愈广泛地得到全世界人民的支持。朝鲜人民要求统一自己祖国的力量，战后六年来有了飞速的增长。经受了战争严峻考验的朝鲜北部民主基地，在英雄的朝鲜人民战后六年的辛勤建设下，在社会主义阵营各国的支援下，不但从废墟上重建起来，并且跨上了社会主义建设的千里马，取得了辉煌成就，比过去任何时候都更为巩固了。朝鲜北部工农业生产水平早已远远超过战前水平，战后第一个五年计划将提前完成，农业合作化的历史任务已胜利完成，人民生活已经得到了显著改善，全体人民正在向着几年内建成发达的社会主义工业国的目标奋勇前进。朝鲜人民社会主义建设的每一个成就，都标志着北部民主基地的迅速壮大，都鼓舞着朝鲜人民更顽强地为统一祖国进行斗争的信心。朝鲜北部的欣欣向荣，和南朝鲜人民沦于失业、饥饿、疾病的深渊中，形成鲜明对照。南朝鲜人民从切身的痛苦中，愈来愈清楚地知道美国军队长期占领南朝鲜，是使南北朝鲜人为地分裂的根本原因。他们要求美国军队撤出南朝鲜的愿望，日益强烈；反对美国军队占领南朝鲜和反对李承晚卖国政策的运动正在发展壮大。朝鲜北部人民旺盛的建设热情和蒸蒸日上的繁荣景象，更加鼓舞着他们的斗争意志，人心向北，已经成为一股不可抗拒的洪流。
    形势是愈来愈明显了。美国侵略者想在联合国旗帜的掩护下长期赖在南朝鲜不走是不行的。像过去一样，中国人民全力支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。让我们朝中人民继续携起手来，为要求美军撤出南朝鲜和巩固远东和平而坚决地斗争吧！胜利一定属于英勇不屈的朝鲜人民。
