    Increase in Production of Daily Necessities: A View from Suzhou
    Today, this newspaper publishes news about Suzhou's proactive efforts to increase the production of daily necessities, a topic of widespread public concern. The goods needed in people's daily lives are diverse, broadly categorized into three main areas: food, clothing, and daily necessities. Among these, daily necessities have the widest range, varying according to time and place, with different preferences for each individual. They may seem like scattered dots, but the absence of any one item can cause inconvenience. For example, buttons, tacks, hairpins, zippers, brooms, mops... these things may not seem so "prominent" in the ocean of commodities, but without them, people would feel a great deal of inconvenience.
    The supply of certain daily necessities currently falling short of demand is a relatively prominent phenomenon. This is mainly not because the production of daily necessities did not increase or increased very little last year. Although some small factories and handicraft cooperatives that produced daily necessities shifted to manufacturing other products during last year's Great Leap Forward, and timely arrangements were not made to replace them, thus affecting the quantity, variety, and designs of these daily necessities; and the raw materials for certain daily necessities were subject to more or less restriction due to the great demand for raw materials from various construction projects, which also affected the increase in production of these daily necessities; nevertheless, the increase in the production of daily necessities was still very large last year. The value of output of consumer goods in last year's total industrial output value increased by 34% compared to the previous year. Among them, cotton yarn increased by 31%, and other forty-one major light industrial products increased by 40%. Such a high rate of increase is rare in our country's history. However, the purchasing power of our people has grown even more. Last year, due to the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the realization of rural people's communes, and especially due to the expansion of employment, people's incomes increased, and consumption also increased greatly. According to investigation materials from ten counties, including Suqian County in Jiangsu, Linquan County in Anhui, and Suiping County in Henan, compared with the previous year, the sales volume of rubber shoes increased by 115%, enamel washbasins increased by 79.7%, enamel mugs increased by 61.5%, and soap increased by 8.8%. Since the beginning of this year, although the production of daily necessities has increased significantly compared with the same period last year, the sales volume of many daily necessities has increased several times more than the same period last year. These situations show that the current tight supply of daily necessities is mainly due to the growth of people's purchasing power exceeding the growth of production. This is a temporary difficulty that is difficult to completely avoid in the process of the Great Leap Forward in production, and it can be gradually overcome through active efforts. Our policy is to encourage thrift while striving to increase the production of daily necessities, and to improve the current situation of supply falling short of demand as quickly as possible. The question now is what measures to take to rapidly and vigorously increase the production of daily necessities. In this regard, Suzhou City in Jiangsu Province provides us with experience.
    Under the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee began to place the issue of increasing the production of daily necessities in an important position from the first quarter of this year. In April, it strengthened leadership and took active measures, so the production of daily necessities has greatly improved, and there has been development in variety and design. Famous brands that had been suspended or reduced in production (such as the famous Zhang Xiaoquan scissors) and traditional products (such as Suzhou fans) continued to be produced in large quantities; dozens of products that were originally not produced locally and needed to be imported from other places can now be produced; some products (such as soap) can not only meet local needs but also support other places; and service repair industries have been restored and developed.
    What experiences does Suzhou's focus on the production of daily necessities provide?
    First, it is necessary to appropriately adjust the industrial production layout, and combine key industries and general industries well, so that the production of daily necessities occupies a certain position in the entire industrial production. Our industrial production must have priorities, and heavy industry is of course a priority. For example, steel is related to the fundamental plan of our national construction and the happiness of our future generations, so it is extremely important. However, in our large country with a large population, the need for consumer goods is extremely huge, and it is related to the lives of hundreds of millions of people in front of us, and it should not be underestimated. Therefore, to ensure the normal development of the production of daily necessities, it is necessary to allocate corresponding human and material resources to serve the production of daily necessities, which requires a reasonable production layout. Because Suzhou City appropriately adjusted the production layout, it restored some of the "transferred" small hardware factories, and appropriately increased the number of production units and technical personnel, and transferred more than 1,000 skilled workers and some special equipment who originally produced daily necessities but later transferred to their original production positions; they lined up the products by category, and gave priority to the production of goods urgently needed in the market. As a result, it ensured both the priorities and took care of the general, and promoted the rapid development of daily necessities. This is an important and correct measure taken by Suzhou City in vigorously increasing the production of daily necessities.
    According to Suzhou's experience, in the rational adjustment of the production layout, it is necessary to carry out meticulous ideological work. For example, some people are unwilling to produce these scattered daily necessities with small output value, and their interests are only focused on those commodities with large output value; also, some people look down on these small hardware factories, small daily miscellaneous goods factories, or handicrafts, and always want to turn their factory into a medium-sized or large factory, only want to be a red flower, not willing to be a green leaf, only want to be the moon, not willing to be a star. These ideas are obviously incorrect, and must be debated among the workers and masses to reach ideological consensus and recognize the great significance of producing daily necessities for meeting the needs of the people's lives. In this way, the enthusiasm of the workers for increasing the production of daily necessities will be greatly improved.
    Secondly, Suzhou's experience proves that the raw material problem of daily necessities can be appropriately solved. Many daily necessities do not require any particularly valuable raw materials, so there are many sources of raw materials. Suzhou City has adopted three measures, namely: linking up with large factories and construction departments to use their edge materials and waste materials; vigorously recycling waste products; and manufacturing them themselves. In addition to the part that needs to be allocated by the state, the vast majority of the raw material problems for daily necessities can be solved by themselves. Suzhou is a medium-sized city with a population of 500,000, and there are dozens of such cities in our country. Although the conditions and conditions are not exactly the same, it is still possible to solve part or most of the raw materials for the production of daily necessities by ourselves.
    Third, in order to vigorously and rapidly increase the production of daily necessities to meet the needs of the people, it is necessary to implement the policy of promoting industry, agriculture and commerce simultaneously. Although commerce does not directly produce products, it has extremely close links with production. The purchase of many raw materials and waste products depends on it, and the timely sale of daily necessities depends on it. In the production of daily necessities, the commercial department has the role of organizing production and promoting production. Therefore, further strengthening industrial and commercial cooperation and fully valuing and giving full play to the role of commerce are necessary measures to vigorously increase the production of daily light industrial products.
    Of course, the production of daily necessities in Suzhou City needs to continue its efforts. For example, further specific measures should be taken to solve the problems of quality and cost. In this way, achievements can be consolidated and the intended goals can be achieved. However, their achievements have proved that their direction and practices are correct. If all cities and towns across the country, like Suzhou, do it themselves, practice diligence and thrift, rationally adjust the production layout, actively develop sources of raw materials, and strive to increase the production of daily necessities, then the production of daily industrial products will inevitably grow rapidly, which is of great significance for ensuring market supply and promoting the development of production and construction.

### 从苏州看日用品的增产

    从苏州看日用品的增产
    今天本报发表了苏州市积极增产日用工业品的新闻，这是目前人们普遍关心的问题。人们日常生活中所需要的商品是五花八门的，归纳起来，是吃、穿、用三大项。其中又以用的范围最广，因时因地而异，各人喜爱不同，看起来星星点点，但缺少一样却又不行。例如，钮扣、洋钉、发夹、拉链、扫帚、拖把……，这些东西，在商品的海洋中似乎并不那么
  “显赫”，可是少了它们，人们就会感到很大的不便。
    目前某些日用品的供不应求是比较突出的现象。这主要不是因为去年日用品的生产没有增产或者增产很少。虽然，去年大跃进中有一些生产日用品的小工厂和手工业合作社转业制造其他产品，对日用品的生产没有及时作好接替的安排，因而影响了这一部分日用品的数量和花色品种；某些日用品的原材料，由于各项建设的大发展对原材料的需求很大，因而受到或多或少的限制，也影响了这些日用品的增产；但是，去年日用品的增产仍然是很大的。去年工业生产总产值中属于生活资料的产值，比前年增加了34％。其中棉纱增长了31％，其他四十一种轻工业主要产品增长了40％。这样的高速度的增产，在我国历史上是罕见的。但是，我国人民的购买力却增长更大。去年由于工农业生产的大发展，农村人民公社化的实现，特别是由于就业面的扩大，人民的收入增加了，消费量也随之大大增长了。据江苏宿迁县、安徽临泉县、河南遂平县等十个县的调查材料表明，与前年比较，去年胶鞋的销售量增长了115％，塘瓷面盆增长了79.7％，搪瓷口杯增长了61.5％，肥皂增长了8.8％。今年以来，日用品的生产比去年同期虽然又有很大的增长，但是，许多日用品的销售量更比去年同期有成倍的增长。这些情况说明，目前日用品供应的紧张，主要是由于人民购买力的增长超过了生产的增长。这是生产大跃进过程中难于完全避免的，也是经过积极努力可以逐步克服的暂时的困难。我们的方针是在鼓励节约的同时，努力增加日用品的生产，尽可能迅速地改善目前的供不应求的状况。现在的问题是采取什么措施，迅速地大力增产日用工业品。在这方面，江苏省的苏州市向我们提供了经验。
    在江苏省委领导下，苏州市委从今年第一季度起，就开始把增产日用工业品的问题放在重要位置上。4月份又加强了领导，采取了积极措施，因而日用工业品的生产有了很大改进，在花色品种上都有了发展。一度停产、减产的名牌货（如著名的张小泉剪刀），传统产品（如苏州扇子）等继续大量生产了，原来自己不生产需要外地调进的几十种产品也能生产了；一些产品（如肥皂）不仅能满足本地需要而且能支援外地了；服务性的修理行业恢复和发展了。
    苏州市大抓日用品的生产提供了些什么经验呢？
    首先是适当地调整工业生产布局，把重点工业和一般工业很好地结合起来，使日用工业品的生产在整个工业生产中，占有一定的阵地。我们的工业生产必须要有重点，重工业当然是重点，例如钢铁，关系到我们国家建设的根本大计，关系我们子孙万代的幸福，当然是极其重要的。但是在我们这样一个人口众多的大国里，消费品的需要极其巨大，它关系到眼前成亿人民的生活，切不可以轻视。因此要保证日用工业品生产的正常发展，就要划出相应的人力和物力，为生产日用品服务，这就要有合理的生产布局。苏州市由于适当地调整了生产布局，把一些“转业”的小五金厂重新恢复起来，并且适当增加了生产单位和技术力量，把那些原来生产日用品而后来转业的一千多熟练工人和若干专用设备，调回到原来的生产岗位；在产品上分门别类地排队，市场上急需的商品，尽先进行生产。结果，既保证了重点，又照顾了一般，促进了日用工业品的迅速发展，这是苏州市在大力增产日用品中的一个重要的正确的措施。
    根据苏州的经验，在合理调整生产布局中，必须进行细致的思想工作，比如，有些人不愿意生产这些零零星星产值微小的日用品，他们的兴趣只集中在那些产值大的商品上；也有些人看不起这些小五金厂、小日用杂品厂或者手工业，总想把自己的厂变成一个中型厂或者大型厂，只想当红花，不愿作绿叶，只想当月亮，不愿作星星。这些思想显然是不正确的，必须在职工群众中进行辩论，求得思想上一致，认清生产日用品对于满足人民生活需要的重大意义。这样，职工们增产日用工业品的劲头就会大大提高。
    其次，苏州的经验证明，日用工业品的原材料问题是可以适当解决的。许多日用工业品，并不需要什么特别贵重的原材料，因此，原材料来源很多。苏州市采取了三项办法，即：和大厂、建筑部门挂钩，利用它们的边料、废料；大力回收废品；自己制造。日用工业品的原材料问题，除了一部分需要国家拨给以外，其余绝大部分自己均可解决。苏州是一个五十万人的中等城市，这类城市在我国有好几十个，虽然情况条件不尽相同，但是自己动手解决一部分或者一大部分日用品生产的原材料，还是可以办到的。
    第三，要想大力迅速增产日用品，满足人民的需要，必须贯彻实行工农商并举的方针。商业虽然不直接生产产品，但是和生产有极其密切的联系，许多原材料、废品的收购要靠它收进来，日用品生产出来要靠它及时销出去。在日用品生产中，商业部门具有组织生产、促进生产的作用。因此，进一步加强工商协作，十分重视和充分发挥商业的作用，是大力增产日用轻工业品所必须采取的措施。
    苏州市的日用工业品的生产，当然需要继续努力，比如关于质量和成本问题还要采取进一步的具体措施加以解决，这样，才能巩固成绩和达到预定的目标。然而，他们已取得的成效，证实他们的方向和做法是正确的。如果全国所有城镇，都像苏州一样地自己动手，克勤克俭，合理地调整生产布局，积极开辟原材料的来源，努力增产日用品，那末日用工业品的生产必然会迅速增长上去，这对保证市场供应和促进生产建设的发展，都具有重要的意义。
