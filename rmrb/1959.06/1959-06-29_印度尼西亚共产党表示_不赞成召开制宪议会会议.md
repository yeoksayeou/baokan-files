Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 27th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported today that the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, D.N. Aidit, said in a letter to the Communist Party's parliamentary group in the Constituent Assembly, that the Communist Party's parliamentary group should only agree to attend the Constituent Assembly if the Constituent Assembly deems it urgent and necessary to convene a plenary session to discuss the issue of dissolving itself.

The newspaper said that the Indonesian Communist Party does not approve of holding Constituent Assembly meetings again in the future in order to avoid unnecessary tension. If the agenda committee of the Constituent Assembly does not accept the views of the Indonesian Communist Party, then the Indonesian Communist Party only agrees to convene a Constituent Assembly meeting to discuss the issue of dissolving the Constituent Assembly.

The Indonesian Nationalist Party's organ, "Indonesian Torch," and the Islamic Teachers Association's "Social Messenger," both published editorials expressing disagreement with any resolution by the agenda committee of the Constituent Assembly to restore the Constituent Assembly meetings.

    印度尼西亚共产党表示
    不赞成召开制宪议会会议
    新华社雅加达27日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在写给制宪议会中的共产党议会党团的一封信中说，共产党的议会党团只有在制宪议会应该认为召开制宪议会全体会议来讨论解散它本身的问题是紧急的和必须的情况下，才同意出席制宪议会。
    这家报纸说，印度尼西亚共产党不赞成在将来再举行制宪议会会议，以便避免不必要的紧张状态。如果制宪议会议程委员会不接受印度尼西亚共产党的看法，那末印度尼西亚共产党只同意召开制宪议会会议来讨论解散制宪议会的问题。
    印度尼西亚国民党的机关报“印度尼西亚火炬报”和伊斯兰教师联合会的“社会使者报”发表社论都表示不同意制宪议会议程委员会关于恢复制宪议会会议的任何决议。
