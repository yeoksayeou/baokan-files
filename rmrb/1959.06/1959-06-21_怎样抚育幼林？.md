How to Tending Young Forests?
Forestry Department Afforestation Division

    The purpose of tending young forests is to create good growing conditions for them, improve the survival rate of afforestation, and effectively promote the rapid growth of young trees.

    How to carry out young forest tending? This should be determined according to the growth status of the young forest, tree species, age, afforestation method, and forest land conditions. Generally speaking, newly planted young forests should be tended two or three times a year for several consecutive years until the young forest canopy closes. In this process, the tending of the current year is the most important, because the tending at this time not only determines the growth rate of the young forest, but also determines whether the young forest can survive. For forests planted in the spring, tending should be carried out shortly after planting.

    The main tasks of young forest tending are weeding, loosening soil, etc., but due to different natural conditions and tree species, the tending methods are also different.

    1. In areas with combined forestry and agriculture and comprehensive land preparation, comprehensive tending should be carried out. Crops are very close to young trees. Weeding and loosening the soil should be carried out at the outer edge of five inches to one foot away from the young trees to avoid harming them. The depth should be about three to five inches.

    2. In areas with pit-shaped (block-shaped) and strip-shaped land preparation, block-shaped or strip-shaped hoeing can be used, starting from inside the young tree and working outwards. The depth should be two to three inches. For strip-shaped weeding and soil loosening, the hoeed sod should be piled up horizontally in strips to help maintain soil and water and promote the decomposition of organic matter.

    3. The main purpose of managing special economic forests (oil tea, tung oil, etc.) is usually to pick fruits. The afforestation density is sparse and there are large open spaces in the forest, and there are more weeds. Therefore, more timely and meticulous tending should be carried out. The afforestation should be tended at least twice in the current year.

    4. In purple soil or peeled mountain areas, the soil structure is very poor, the erosion is serious, the wind is strong, and the summer temperature is high. Trees are not easy to survive. After afforestation, tending is more urgently needed, and the tending work is required to be more complete. In the year of afforestation, especially after the rainy season, soil should be added, roots should be supported, and seedlings should be replanted in a timely manner. Before the dry season, soil should be loosened and added and covered with grass multiple times to prevent soil moisture evaporation and reduce soil temperature. To avoid erosion, the soil should not be loosened too finely or too deeply.

    5. In areas with frost damage, the soil should be compacted in time before the season when frost damage may occur.

    6. In areas with direct seeding afforestation or sprout forests and artificial promotion of natural regeneration, because there are too many young trees and the branches are too dense, from the third year onwards, combined with tending, the strong should be retained and the weak removed, and the plants should be gradually thinned. When the canopy closes, only one plant with a straight shape and strong growth should be left at each planting point (oil tea can retain one to three plants depending on the specific situation); if it is a shrub with strong sprouting ability, it can be cut flat in the autumn and winter two or three years later to promote their branching growth.

    7. Although Masson pine and larch are both light-loving tree species, they still need a certain amount of lateral shading in the first one or two years. Therefore, there is no need to weed too much in the first one or two years, and it is enough to do it once or twice a year. After two or three years, the light requirement of these tree species gradually increases, and the number of times of weeding and soil loosening should also be increased. Poplar, willow and other soft broad-leaved trees like sunlight from an early age and grow very quickly. They should be tended at least two or three times in the first year; in dry areas with many weeds, the number of tending should also be increased.

    8. For bamboo forest tending, weed and loosen the soil before the annual bamboo shoot emergence, loosen the soil in strips on the uphill side of the bamboo, and properly thin the downhill side to promote the upward development of the bamboo. (Attached picture)

    怎样抚育幼林？
    林业部造林司
    抚育幼林的目的是为幼林创造良好的生长条件，提高造林成活率，有效地促进幼树的迅速生长。
    怎样进行幼林抚育呢？这要根据幼林生长状况、树种、年龄、造林方法以及林地情况来确定。一般来说，刚栽上的幼林每年要抚育二、三次，连续几年，直到幼林郁闭为止。在这个过程中，当年的抚育最为重要，因为这时的抚育不仅决定幼林的成长速度，而且决定幼林的能否成活。春季造的林，应该在造林后短期内进行一次抚育。
    幼林抚育的主要工作是除草、松土等，但由于自然条件和树种的不同，抚育的方法也有所区别。
    一，在林粮结合、全面整地的地区，应进行全面抚育。农作物离幼树很近，除草、松土要在距离幼树五寸至一尺的外围进行，以免伤害幼树。深度以三至五寸左右为宜。
    二，穴状（块状）和带状整地的地区，可采用块状或带状下锄，围绕幼树由里向外进行。深度二至三寸为宜。带状除草、松土，要把锄下来的草皮成水平带状堆放起来，以利保持水土，并促进有机质的分解。
    三，特种经济林（油茶、油桐等）经营的主要目的通常是采摘果实，造林密度较疏、林中空地较大，杂草也较多，因此，更应及时而又细致地进行抚育，造林的当年至少抚育两次。
    四，紫色土或剥皮山地区，土壤结构很差，冲刷严重，风力较大，夏季温度较高，林木不易成活，造林后更迫切需要抚育，并且要求抚育工作做得比较完善。造林当年，尤其是雨季后，要及时培土、扶兜、补植，旱季前要多次松土、培土并盖草，防止土壤水分蒸发和降低土壤温度。为避免冲刷，松土时不宜太碎、太深。
    五，在有冻害的地区，要在可能发生冻害的季节以前及时紧土。
    六，在直播造林或萌芽林和人工促进天然更新的地区，因幼树过多、枝条过密，应从第三年起结合抚育，留强去弱，逐步间株，到郁闭时每种植点只留一株树形端正、生长健壮的植株（油茶可根据具体情况留一株到三株）；如果是萌芽力强的灌木、可在二年，三年后的秋冬间平土截干，促使它们分枝生长。
    七，油松、落叶松虽然都是阳性树种，但在最初一、二年里还需要一定的侧方庇荫，因而在头一、二年内就不需要多除草，每年进行一、二次就行了。二、三年以后，这些树种的需光性逐渐加强，除草、松土的次数也就应该增加。杨、柳等软阔叶树，由于它们自幼就喜爱阳光，生长很快，头一年至少要抚育二、三次；在杂草多的干旱地区，抚育次数还应增加。
    八，山竹成林抚育，在每年出笋以前除草、松土，在竹子上坡作带状松土，在下坡适当间伐，以促使竹子向上坡发展。（附图片）
