Xinhua News Agency, Xining, June 6th. The Yellow River Bridge on the HeKou-Xining section of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway was fully completed recently, three months ahead of schedule. Now, the track-laying workers have laid the rails across the Yellow River and are advancing towards Qinghai.

This bridge is 240 meters long and is located near the confluence of the Huangshui and Yellow Rivers. The construction began in June last year, and it encountered an unprecedented major flood that lasted for five months, which had not been seen in forty years. However, the workers of the 206th Engineering District of the Xining Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who were responsible for the construction, broke with convention and continued construction during the flood season. They also overcame various difficulties such as severe winter cold, large amounts of ice floes, and extremely complex underwater geological conditions. For example, when the caisson of the No. 5 pier was sinking, it encountered a 6-meter-thick layer of isolated boulders, and the water in the caisson could not be pumped out. The bridge builders adopted methods such as underwater operations, blasting, and underwater grouting to accelerate the sinking speed of the caisson, so that the bridge was completed in less than a year, and the quality met the design standards.

### 兰青路黄河大桥提前建成

    兰青路黄河大桥提前建成
    新华社西宁6日电　兰青铁路河口—西宁段内的黄河大桥，提前三个月于最近全部建成。现在，铺轨工人们已经将钢轨铺过黄河，向着青海境内挺进。
    这座大桥全长二百四十公尺，位于湟水与黄河合流处附近。这里水深流急，自去年6月开工以来，又遇到了四十年来未有的、历时五个月的特大洪水。但是，担任施工的铁道部西宁铁路局二○六工区职工，打破了惯例，在洪水期照常施工，并且克服了冬季严寒、大量流冰，以及水下地质情况极其复杂等种种困难。如五号桥墩的沉井下沉时，遇到了六公尺厚的孤石层，沉井里的水老是抽不干，建桥工人们就采取潜水作业以及放排炮和水中灌注等办法，加快了沉井下沉的速度，使这座大桥历时不到一年就建成了，质量合乎设计标准。（附图片）
