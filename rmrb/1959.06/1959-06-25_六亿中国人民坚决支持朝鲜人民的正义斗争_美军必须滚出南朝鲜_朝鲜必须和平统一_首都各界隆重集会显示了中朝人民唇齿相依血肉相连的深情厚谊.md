Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: A grand gathering of 1,500 representatives from all sectors of the capital was held tonight, expressing the firm support of 650 million Chinese people for the just struggle of the Korean people demanding the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and the peaceful reunification of their fatherland. The conference solemnly appealed: For the sake of peace, for the national reunification of Korea, the American aggressor troops must get out of South Korea.

Today's conference was held in response to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, the World Peace Congress, and the World Federation of Trade Unions regarding the "Day for Demanding the Withdrawal of American Troops from South Korea," and was jointly initiated by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, the China-Korea Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the All-China Youth Federation.

Tonight, the auditorium of the CPPCC, where the conference was held, appeared particularly solemn. A huge banner hung on the wall opposite the rostrum: "Long Live the Great Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean People Forged in Blood!" The red-lettered slogans on golden backgrounds hanging outside the venue and on both sides of the venue were: "Support the Just Struggle of the Korean People for the Peaceful Reunification of Their Fatherland!" "American Troops Get Out of South Korea!" "Long Live the Great Solidarity of the Asian and African People!" "Long Live World Peace!" All of this demonstrated the determination of our people to fully and resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people.

At about 7 p.m. tonight, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, and others accompanied Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yonghao, to the rostrum. At this moment, the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, as close as lips and teeth, stirred the hearts of everyone, and people applauded warmly for a long time, paying high tribute to the Korean people who have made brilliant contributions to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

The conference was presided over by Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee. In his speech, he said that since the Korean Armistice, the United States has seriously violated the Armistice Agreement. After the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, the American aggressors and their accomplices have remained in South Korea, and have intensified their efforts to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and carry out war provocations against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This barbaric act of aggression by the United States threatens the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and peace in the Far East and the world, arousing great anger and widespread opposition from peace-loving people all over the world. Peace-loving people all over the world are unanimously demanding that the American aggressor troops must get out of South Korea and let the Korean people solve their own problems. We firmly believe that this struggle of the fraternal Korean people, with the support of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people, will surely win the final victory.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, then spoke (full text on page four). He said that the Korean-Chinese side has always abided by the Korean Armistice Agreement and has made unremitting efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, winning the warm welcome and widespread support of peace-loving people all over the world. In contrast, the American imperialists have completely disregarded the wishes of the Korean people and all peace-loving people, and have always adhered to a policy of aggression against Korea. The war provocation behavior of the American aggressors not only hinders the peaceful reunification of Korea, but also seriously threatens the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and peace in the Far East and the world.

Guo Moruo said that due to the American imperialists' forcible occupation of South Korea and their implementation of a brutal colonial enslavement policy and war policy there, South Korea today has become a dark and inhuman hell. In stark contrast to this terrible phenomenon in South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is thriving in socialist construction and constantly achieving brilliant successes. The vigorous atmosphere of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made the desire of the disaster-stricken South Korean people for peaceful reunification of their fatherland even stronger. They have become increasingly aware that only by driving out the American aggressor troops and realizing the peaceful reunification of their fatherland can the South Korean people escape from their dire situation.

Guo Moruo said: The Korean people's struggle to demand the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of their fatherland is completely just. This not only conforms to the common aspiration of all Korean people, but also conforms to the interests of peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world stand on the side of the Korean people. Now, the American aggressor troops have no reason to continue to stay in South Korea. The reason why they shamelessly occupy South Korea and carry out all kinds of war provocations is nothing more than an attempt to permanently divide Korea, obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, and turn South Korea into an American colony and military base, so as to launch a new war of aggression one day. This is resolutely opposed by all Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world. For the sake of peace, for the national reunification of Korea, the American aggressor troops must get out of South Korea.

Guo Moruo said that for the common cause of socialism, for the common struggle against aggression and in defense of peace, the people of our two countries, China and Korea, will always unite together, support each other, and help each other. We deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland, and we, together with the Korean people and the people of the world, resolutely demand that all American aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea. We firmly believe that the just struggle of the Korean people, with the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, will surely be victorious. The unification of Korea's beautiful mountains and rivers and the reunion of all compatriots will surely be realized. All aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism to occupy South Korea and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea will be completely defeated. The evil policy of American imperialism to invade and oppress the people of Asia, Africa, and the world will also be completely and utterly defeated.

Korean Ambassador to China Li Yonghao was invited to speak at the conference (full text on page four). He said that until today, our motherland is still in an intolerable state: the territory is divided, and the people of our single nation are living separately in the North and South. The root cause of all this lies in the American imperialists' policy of aggression and the American military's forcible occupation of South Korea.

The Ambassador pointed out: "If the American imperialist aggressor troops did not forcibly occupy South Korea, the Korean people would have peacefully reunified their fatherland long ago, and the people of North and South Korea would have been living a happy and prosperous life together long ago."

The Ambassador said righteously: Korea is the Korea of the Korean people. The Korean question must be peacefully resolved by the Korean people themselves. No means of the American imperialist aggressive clique can justify the American aggressor troops' stay in South Korea. American imperialism must immediately withdraw its troops from South Korea. This is the unanimous demand of the people of all peace-loving countries.

Ambassador Li Yonghao said with full confidence: The Korean people understand that their just struggle to maintain peace, strive for national unification, and demand the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea is by no means isolated, but is unanimously supported by peace-loving people all over the world. The Korean people, through their own just struggle and the enthusiastic support of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely force the American imperialist aggressive troops to withdraw from South Korea.

The speeches of Chairman Guo Moruo and Ambassador Li Yonghao were repeatedly interrupted by warm applause from the audience.

Subsequently, the leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations in our country spoke at the meeting one after another, warmly supporting the just struggle of the Korean people demanding the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of their fatherland.

Cai Tingkai, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said that we feel boundless anger at the towering crimes of American imperialism in undermining the Armistice Agreement, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and persecuting the South Korean people. We fully support the just struggle of the Korean people, demand that the American troops immediately get out of South Korea, and that the Korean question should be solved by the Korean people themselves. We warn the American aggressors that if they dare to launch a new war of aggression in Korea, they will suffer an even more tragic and shameful defeat than six years ago. The American military's desire to stay in South Korea will not work.

Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said: Peaceful reunification of Korea is the demand of all Korean people, and it is also the demand of peace-loving people all over the world. To realize the peaceful reunification of Korea, to eliminate the threat to peace in the Far East and world peace, and to relieve the suffering of the South Korean people, the troops of American imperialism must get out of South Korea. The threat of American imperialism to Korea is a threat to peace in the Far East and the world, and also a threat to us Chinese people. We resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people against American aggression.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said in his speech on behalf of all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association that they, along with the people of the whole country, warmly support the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of Korea, resolutely demand that the American imperialist troops get out of South Korea, and believe that the peaceful reunification of Korea's three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains can be realized.

Li Dequan, President of the China-Korea Friendship Association, said that the people of our two countries, China and Korea, have a deep traditional friendship, and this friendship was established and developed in the long-term revolutionary struggle against the common enemy. Our friendship is based on the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism, and it is an eternal and invincible great friendship. The people of our country resolutely support the Korean people's struggle for peaceful reunification, and we will resolutely fight to the end, and we will not give up until we drive the American military out of South Korea.

Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that American imperialism is not only the enemy of all Korean people, but also the common enemy of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and peace-loving people all over the world. The American occupation forces must get out of South Korea, get out of Taiwan, and get out of Asia and other regions. The Chinese workers fully support the just struggle of the workers and people of the whole of Korea for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Chinese workers are carrying out a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, striving to complete this year's comprehensive leap forward plan and accelerate the socialist construction of our country, in order to strengthen the power to support the just struggle of all Korean people and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said that in the years of jointly resisting the American imperialists' war of aggression against Korea, the hearts of the Chinese people, Chinese women, and Chinese mothers and the Korean people, Korean women, and Korean mothers have long been closely linked together. We suffer for the suffering of the Korean people and rejoice for the victory of the Korean people. She said that today, Chinese women and the Chinese people, together with peace-loving people and women all over the world, resolutely support the Korean people's just struggle to demand the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, oppose American imperialist aggression, and realize the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Zhang Chao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, said that as long as the American military does not withdraw from South Korea for one day, the peaceful reunification of the motherland that the Korean people strongly desire cannot be realized for one day, and the danger of a new war will still exist. Chinese youth, together with the Chinese people, resolutely support the just struggle launched by the Korean people and Korean youth for peace, for national reunification, and to demand the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. The Korean people will surely be able to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and will surely be able to drive the American imperialist aggressor troops out of South Korea.

The people's organizations and democratic parties attending the conference also included Zhang Xiruo, Chu Tunan, Wang Shao'ao, Ji Fang, Yan Xichun, Pan Shu, Xu Mengshan, and others, as well as the leaders of various people's organizations in Beijing. Qiao Xiaoguang, Chinese Ambassador to Korea, attended today's conference.

Korean peace figure Huang Fengjiu, Japanese peace figure Kinkazu Saionji, Korean students and interns in Beijing, and foreign guests from Vietnam and Thailand who are currently visiting Beijing were invited to attend the conference. At the conference tonight, a telegram to the Korean people was unanimously adopted, fully supporting the just struggle of the Korean people.

    六亿中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争
    美军必须滚出南朝鲜　朝鲜必须和平统一
    首都各界隆重集会显示了中朝人民唇齿相依血肉相连的深情厚谊
    据新华社24日讯　首都各界代表一千五百人今晚举行隆重集会，表示六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民要求美军撤出南朝鲜和实现祖国和平统一的正义斗争。大会庄严地呼吁：为了和平，为了朝鲜的民族统一，美国侵略军必须滚出南朝鲜。
    今天的大会是响应亚非人民团结理事会，世界和平理事会和世界工会联合会关于“要求美军撤出南朝鲜日”的号召，由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中国朝鲜友好协会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会和中华全国青年联合会共同发起举行的。
    今晚，作为大会会场的政协礼堂显得格外庄严。主席台对面墙壁上高悬巨幅标语：“中朝人民用鲜血凝结成的伟大友谊万岁！”会场外面和会场两旁悬挂的红底金字标语是：“支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的正义斗争！”“美军滚出南朝鲜！”“亚非人民大团结万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”这一切，都显示了我国人民全力坚决支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争的决心。
    今晚七时许，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志等陪同朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐登上主席台。这时候，中朝人民唇齿相依、血肉相连的深情厚谊激动着每一个人的内心，人们长时间的热烈鼓掌，向为维护远东和世界和平做出辉煌贡献的朝鲜人民致以崇高的敬意。
    大会由中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志主持，他在致词中说，朝鲜停战以来，美国一直严重地破坏停战协定。在中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜之后，美国侵略者和它的帮凶还赖在南朝鲜不走，并且变本加厉地阻挠朝鲜的和平统一和向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行战争挑衅。美国这种野蛮的侵略行动威胁着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的安全和远东及世界的和平，引起了全世界爱好和平人民的极大愤怒和普遍的反对。全世界爱好和平的人民齐声要求美国侵略军必须从南朝鲜滚出去，让朝鲜人自己解决自己的问题。我们深信，兄弟的朝鲜人民的这一斗争，在以苏联为首的社会主义各国和一切爱好和平的人民的支持下，必将获得最后的胜利。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若接着讲话（全文见第四版）。他说，朝中方面一贯遵守朝鲜停战协定，并且为实现朝鲜的和平统一作出了不懈的努力，赢得了全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎和普遍支持。与此相反，美帝国主义根本不顾朝鲜人民和一切爱好和平的人民的愿望，始终坚持侵略朝鲜的政策。美国侵略者的战争挑衅行为，不仅阻挠了朝鲜的和平统一，而且严重地威胁着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的安全以及远东和世界的和平。
    郭沫若说，由于美帝国主义强占南朝鲜并且在那里推行残酷的殖民奴役政策和战争政策，今天的南朝鲜已经成了暗无天日的人间地狱。同南朝鲜这种可怕的现象截然相反，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在社会主义建设中欣欣向荣，不断取得辉煌的成就。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的蓬勃气象，使得灾难深重的南朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国的愿望更加强烈了。他们已经越来越清楚地认识到，只有把美国侵略军赶出去，实现祖国的和平统一，南朝鲜人民才能摆脱水深火热的境地。
    郭沫若说：朝鲜人民要求美军撤出南朝鲜，和实现祖国和平统一的斗争是完全正义的。这不仅符合全体朝鲜人民的共同愿望，而且符合远东和世界和平的利益。所以，全世界爱好和平的人民都站在朝鲜人民这一边。现在美国侵略军没有任何理由再继续赖在南朝鲜不走。它们所以厚颜无耻地霸占着南朝鲜，并且进行种种战争挑衅，无非是企图永远分裂朝鲜，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，并且把南朝鲜变为美国的殖民地和军事基地，以便有朝一日重新发动侵略战争。这是全体朝鲜人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民所坚决反对的。为了和平，为了朝鲜的民族统一，美国侵略军必须从南朝鲜滚出去。
    郭沫若说，为了社会主义的共同事业，为了反对侵略、保卫和平的共同斗争，我们中朝两国人民将永远团结在一起，相互支持、相互援助。我们深切同情和坚决支持朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的斗争，我们同朝鲜人民和全世界人民一起，坚决要求美国侵略军全部撤出南朝鲜。我们坚信，朝鲜人民的正义斗争，在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支援下，一定能够胜利。朝鲜锦绣山河的统一和全体同胞的团聚是一定要实现的。美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜、阻挠朝鲜和平统一的一切侵略阴谋必将遭到彻底的失败。美帝国主义侵略和压迫亚非和世界人民的罪恶政策，也必将遭到最后的、彻底的失败。
    朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐应邀在大会上讲话（全文见第四版）。他说，直到今天，我们的祖国仍然处于不能容忍的状态中：国土被分裂，单一民族的我国人民隔居南北。这一切祸根就在于美帝国主义的侵略政策和美军强占南朝鲜。
    大使指出：“如果美帝国主义侵略军不强占南朝鲜，朝鲜人民早就会和平统一自己的祖国，南北朝鲜人民也早就会一起过幸福富裕的生活了。”
    大使义正词严地说：朝鲜，是朝鲜人的朝鲜。朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己和平解决。美帝国主义侵略集团的任何手段，也无法使美国侵略军赖在南朝鲜正当化。美帝国主义必须立即把自己的军队撤出南朝鲜。这是所有要求和平国家人民的一致主张。
    李永镐大使满怀信心地说：朝鲜人民懂得，自己维护和平、争取民族统一、要求美军撤出南朝鲜的正义斗争，决不孤立，而是受到全世界爱好和平人民的一致支持。朝鲜人民通过自己的正义斗争和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持，一定会使美帝国主义侵略军队撤出南朝鲜。
    郭沫若主席和李永镐大使的讲话，一再被全场热烈的掌声打断。
    随后，我国各民主党派和人民团体的负责人相继在会上讲话，热烈支持朝鲜人民要求美军撤出南朝鲜和实现祖国和平统一的正义斗争。
    民革副主席蔡廷锴说，我们对于美帝国主义破坏停战协定、阻挠朝鲜和平统一、迫害南朝鲜人民的滔天罪行感到无比的愤怒。我们完全支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争，要求美国军队立即从南朝鲜滚出去，朝鲜问题应由朝鲜人民自己解决。我们警告美国侵略者，如果敢于在朝鲜发动新的侵略战争，必将遭受比六年以前更加悲惨可耻的失败。美国军队想赖在南朝鲜不走是不行的。
    民盟副主席杨明轩说：和平统一朝鲜，是全朝鲜人民的要求，也是全世界爱好和平的人民的要求。要实现朝鲜的和平统一，要消除对远东和平和世界和平的威胁，要解除南朝鲜人民的苦难，美帝国主义的军队必须从南朝鲜滚出去。美帝国主义对朝鲜的威胁，就是对远东和世界和平的威胁，也就是对我们中国人民的威胁，我们坚决地支持朝鲜人民反对美国侵略的正义斗争。
    民建主任委员黄炎培在讲话中代表中国民主建国会全体成员表示，他们和全国人民一道热烈支援朝鲜人民和平统一朝鲜的正义斗争，坚决要求美帝国主义军队从南朝鲜滚出去，并且相信朝鲜三千里锦绣河山的和平统一定能实现。
    中朝友好协会会长李德全说，我们中朝两国人民有着深厚的传统友谊，这种友谊是在长期反对共同敌人的革命斗争中建立和发展起来的。我们的友谊是以马列主义的共同思想为基础的，是永恒的、任何力量不可战胜的伟大友谊。我国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民和平统一的斗争，坚决斗争到底，不把美军赶出南朝鲜，誓不罢休。
    全国总工会副主席刘长胜说，美帝国主义不仅是全朝鲜人民的敌人，也是中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的共同的敌人。美国占领军必须从南朝鲜滚出去，从台湾滚出去，从亚洲和其它地区滚出去。中国工人全力支持全朝鲜工人和人民的和平统一祖国的正义斗争。中国工人正在开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，争取完成今年的全面的跃进计划，加速我国的社会主义建设，来加强支援全朝鲜人民的正义斗争和保卫远东和世界和平的力量。
    全国妇联副主席许广平说，在过去共同抗击美帝国主义进行侵朝战争的年代里，中国人民、中国妇女、中国母亲和朝鲜人民、朝鲜妇女、朝鲜母亲的心早已紧密地连结在一起了，我们为朝鲜人民的苦难而痛苦，为朝鲜人民的胜利而欢笑。她说，今天，中国妇女、中国人民同全世界爱好和平的人民、妇女一道，坚决支持朝鲜人民要求美军撤出南朝鲜、反对美帝国主义侵略、实现朝鲜和平统一的正义斗争。
    全国青联副主席张超说，美军一天不从南朝鲜撤走，朝鲜人民强烈渴望的祖国和平统一就一天无法实现，新的战争危险就仍然存在。中国青年和中国人民一起，坚决支持朝鲜人民和朝鲜青年为和平、争取民族统一和要求美军撤出南朝鲜而展开的正义斗争。朝鲜人民一定能够实现祖国的和平统一，一定能够把美帝国主义侵略军赶出南朝鲜。
    出席大会的人民团体、民主党派的负责人，还有张奚若、楚图南、王绍鏊、季方、严希纯、潘菽、徐萌山等以及北京市各人民团体的负责人。中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光出席了今天的大会。
    在北京的朝鲜和平人士黄凤九，日本和平人士西园寺公一，朝鲜在北京的留学生和实习生，正在北京访问的越南和泰国的外宾，应邀参加了大会。在今晚的大会上，全体一致通过致朝鲜人民电，全力支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。
