Monsoons and Rainfall
Zhang Jijia

    China is a monsoon country, and the annual rainfall is concentrated in the months when the summer monsoon prevails. Due to China's vast area and significant differences in geographic latitude, the rainy season starts at different times in different regions. However, on average, the average rain belt in China shows a trend of development from south to north from spring to summer, which is closely related to the trend of summer monsoon activity advancing from south to north during this period. Generally speaking, this development trend can be divided into three stages: The first stage is the period before around June 15th. During this period, the rainfall in southwestern Guangxi began to increase sharply from April, and the rainfall in the coastal provinces of South China also increased significantly. This is caused by the frequent encounters of warm air from the southeastern seas and cold air from the northwest of the mainland in this area. Therefore, from March to April and from April to May, the rainfall in the provinces of South China generally increases by 50%-100%.

    The second stage is roughly from June 15th to July 15th. The beginning of this stage is characterized climatically by the southwest monsoon from India advancing northward to the skies over Jiangnan in China. At the same time, due to the strengthening of the subtropical high pressure over the Pacific Ocean and its westward extension to the skies over South China, warm and humid air brought from the southern hemisphere often moves northward along the southwest of this westward extending Pacific high pressure, which causes the warm and humid air from the south to meet with the cold air from the north near the Yangtze River basin, causing the rainfall in this area to rise sharply. This is the plum rain season in Jiangnan, China.

    The third stage is roughly after July 15th. The characteristic of this stage is that the warm high pressure in the southwest Pacific moves further westward and often stabilizes over the Jianghuai area south of China. The southeasterly airflow in its southwest replaces the southwest monsoon, that is, the southeast monsoon begins to appear, pushing the zone of cold and warm air confluence northward from the Yangtze River basin to the North China region. Therefore, the rainy season begins in North China, Northeast China, and Inner Mongolia. However, at this time, heat thunderstorms and typhoon rains begin to dominate in South China, creating a secondary high point in the annual rainfall distribution. The Yangtze River basin, especially in the middle and lower reaches, experiences reduced rainfall because it is under the control of the Pacific subtropical high pressure.

    After the end of August, the Siberian cold high gradually strengthens, and the cold air emanating from it gradually pushes the zone of cold and warm air confluence southward from the North China area. At the same time, China's main rain belt also moves southward accordingly. This southward retreat process often creates a secondary peak in rainfall in the southern plains of China. After September, cold air significantly controls the mainland of China, and warm air is forced to retreat south. The cloudy and rainy weather in South China in winter is the result of the warm air that has declined during this period sliding upward over the cold air from the northwest of the mainland, causing the water vapor to condense. However, on a national scale, since September, the rainfall has decreased significantly due to the control of dry and cold air.

    季风和雨量
    章基嘉
    我国是一个季风性的国家，一年中雨量集中在夏季季风盛行的各个月份。由于我国幅员广大，地理纬度悬殊，因此各地雨季开始早晚不一。但是在气候平均情况上，由春到夏，我国平均雨带却显示出一个由南向北发展的趋势，这与夏季季风活动在这一时期由南向北推进的趋势密切有关。一般而论，这种发展趋势可以分为三个阶段：第一个阶段是6月15日左右以前的时期，在这时期中，广西西南地区雨量自4月中起即开始急增，华南沿海各省雨量也随之有显著增加。这是来自东南诸海的暖空气和来自大陆西北方的冷空气在这一带频繁相遇所造成的。因此从3月到4月及4月到5月，华南各省雨量一般增加50％—100％。
    第二个阶段大体从6月15日到7月15日。这阶段开始的特征，在气候上表现为印度西南季风向北推进到达我国江南上空，同时，由于太平洋上副热带高气压增强，并西伸到我国华南上空，经过南海南部及印度支那半岛，常有南半球带来的暖湿气流沿着这个西伸的太平洋高压西南部北上，这样就使得南来的暖湿空气在长江流域附近与北来的冷空气交锋，使这一地区的雨量骤然上升。这正是我国江南的梅雨时期。
    第三个阶段大致在7月15日以后。这阶段的特点是西南太平洋上暖高压更向西推移，并经常稳定在我国江淮以南地区的上空，其西南部的东南气流代替了西南季风，即东南季风开始出现，它把冷暖空气交绥的地带由长江流域向北推至华北地区，因此，华北、东北、内蒙古雨季开始。不过这时华南地区热雷雨及台风雨开始占了优势，并在年雨量分布上造成次高点。长江流域特别是在中下游地区内因为在太平洋副热带高气压控制之下，雨量减少。
    到了8月底以后，西伯利亚冷高压逐渐增强，由它发散出来的冷气流逐渐把冷暖空气交绥的地带由华北一带向南推移。与此同时，我国主要雨带也随之南移，这个南退的过程，经常在我国南方平原地区造成一个雨量的次高峰。9月以后，冷空气显著地控制了我国大陆，暖空气被迫南退。冬季华南阴雨天气，就是这个时期中衰退下来的暖空气在来自大陆西北方的冷空气上滑升减温而导致水汽凝结的结果。但就全国而论，自9月以后由于干冷空气控制，雨量就显著减小了。
