(Xinhua News Agency, June 7th) In the first five months of this year, Chinese male and female athletes have broken nearly ninety national records, which is almost half of the one hundred and eighty-three national sports records announced by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission in January this year.

Since the beginning of this year, Chinese athletes have spent most of their time preparing for the First National Games to be held in September. Thousands of male and female athletes from all over the country have participated in competitions in various events, and good news of breaking provincial, municipal, autonomous region, or national records has been reported continuously in these competitions.

In track and field, the performance of male athletes has been particularly outstanding this year. They have broken thirteen national records, and the results of some events have broken through some "barriers" and are closer to the international level. For example, in the 1,500-meter race, three new athletes have broken the four-minute "barrier" this year, reaching around three minutes and fifty-eight seconds. In the 5,000-meter race, People's Liberation Army athlete Huang Zhiyong's result in early May was the first to break the fifteen-minute barrier, reaching fourteen minutes and fifty-seven seconds and two tenths of a second. However, less than a month later, twenty-three-year-old Su Wenren created an even better result in early June – fourteen minutes and thirty-four seconds and four tenths of a second. Young Su Wenren's result in the 10,000-meter race at the end of May also broke the thirty-one-minute barrier, reaching thirty minutes and six seconds and eight tenths of a second. The results of these athletes all broke national records. Although the national record of ten seconds and six tenths of a second for the men's 100-meter race has not been broken this year, several athletes have already achieved and approached this level. There are even more newcomers in the men's high jump. There are currently ten athletes in the country who have jumped over the standard height for Master of Sports – one meter and ninety-two centimeters. Among them, eighteen-year-old Shi Hongfan and twenty-one-year-old Duan Qiyan both jumped over one meter and ninety-six centimeters in May, approaching the two-meter "barrier". In the women's high jump, there are currently ten athletes in the country whose results have reached the Master of Sports standard – one meter and fifty-eight centimeters. Among them, Yang Meiru and Guo Naiying have both jumped over one meter and sixty-one centimeters.

In weightlifting, the national records for all three individual events in the middleweight class, held by famous athletes Huang Qianghui and Zhu Hongquan, were broken in March this year. Among them, there were four people who broke Huang Qianghui's national record of one hundred and thirteen kilograms in the middleweight snatch.

Newcomers in swimming have also performed very well. Seventeen-year-old Shanghai female breaststroke athlete Liu Lisen and female backstroke athlete Zhou Yongqi have broken national records more than once this year. Among male swimmers, there has also been a situation where national records have been broken multiple times. Among them, Chen Yunpeng, who has broken the national butterfly record three times, has reached the international level in both the 100-meter and 200-meter butterfly.

    据新华社7日讯　在今年的头五个多月里，我国男、女运动员已经刷新了近九十项全国纪录，这几乎占了国家体育运动委员会今年1月公布的一百八十三项体育运动全国纪录的一半。
    今年以来，我国运动员大部分时间都在准备着迎接9月间召开的第一届全国运动会。全国各地已有成千上万的男、女运动员参加了各种项目的比赛，就在这些比赛中，已经接连传出了打破各省、市、自治区纪录或全国纪录的捷报。
    在田径运动方面，今年男运动员的成绩很突出，他们已经打破了十三项全国纪录，而且其中有些项目的成绩已经分别突破了一些“大关”，更接近了国际水平。例如，在一千五百公尺赛跑中，今年以来又有三名新手突破了四分钟的“大关”，达到了三分五十八秒左右。在五千公尺赛跑中，解放军选手黄志勇5月上旬的成绩第一个突破了十五分钟这一关，达到了十四分五十七秒二，可是才过了不到一个月，二十三岁的苏文仁6月初又创造了更好的成绩——十四分三十四秒四。年轻的苏文仁今年5月底一万公尺的成绩也第一个突破了三十一分钟这一关，达到了三十分六秒八。这些运动员的成绩都打破了全国纪录。男子一百公尺十秒六的全国纪录，今年虽然还没有被打破，但是目前也已有好几名选手的成绩达到了和接近了这个水平。男子跳高的新手更多，目前全国已有十名选手跳过了运动健将标准的高度——一公尺九十二公分，其中十八岁的史鸿范和二十一岁的段其炎，5月间都跳过了一公尺九十六公分，逼近了两公尺“大关”。女子跳高方面，目前全国也有十名选手的成绩达到了运动健将标准——一公尺五十八公分，其中杨美如和郭乃莹都跳过了一公尺六十一公分。
    在举重运动中，由著名选手黄强辉和朱鸿全保持的中量级三个单项的全国纪录，在今年3月间就已经全部被打破。其中，打破黄强辉保持的中量级抓举一百一十三公斤全国纪录的，就有四人。
    游泳运动方面的新手表现也很突出。上海十七岁的女子蛙泳选手柳立森和女子仰泳选手周咏琪，今年以来都不止一次地打破了全国纪录。在男子游泳选手中，也出现了一个连破多次全国纪录的情况。其中已经三次打破蝶泳全国纪录的陈运鹏，一百和二百公尺蝶泳成绩都达到了国际水平。
