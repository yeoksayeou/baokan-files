    Taking Agriculture as the Foundation to Drive Diversified Operations
    Shui Shi Commune in Ningyuan County Develops Production Comprehensively According to Local Conditions
    According to a report in New Hunan Daily, Shui Shi Commune in Ningyuan, Hunan, has achieved a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery by taking grain as the lead.
    The commune's nearly 30,000 mu of early and mid-season rice is now a sea of green, with the early rice already heading and flowering. The plan to expand summer sweet potato planting by 5,000 mu has been overfulfilled by 100%. Crops such as sugarcane, peanuts, cotton, jute, ramie, lilies, medicinal herbs, and watermelons are being processed and cultivated. Animal husbandry and aquaculture are accelerating their development. On average, each household has more than one pig, and chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits are numerous, with an average of seven domestic fowl per household. The more than 2,540 head of cattle raised on the three pastures are fat and plump, and carp, grass carp, and white fish are raised in the ponds. It is truly a scene of "pigs and cattle filling the pens, chickens and ducks in flocks, and fish filling the ponds." The commune and teams operate a total of 358 types of sideline businesses, bringing in more than 750,000 yuan in cash from January to May, providing the commune with ample funds for agricultural production. At the same time, wages are paid to commune members every month, encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses for production.
    Another dispatch states that, under the ideological guidance of focusing on grain production and comprehensively developing diversified economies, the Shui Shi Commune Party Committee has comprehensively arranged labor and leadership forces. The First Secretary and the Agriculture Secretary focus their main efforts on grain production, while the secretaries of animal husbandry, aquaculture, and sideline production are each responsible for their respective areas, and a Party Committee member is dedicated to managing forestry production. Cadres go deep into production teams and work groups to participate in and lead production. In terms of labor arrangement, appropriate arrangements are made according to production needs, technical skills, and physical strength. The entire commune has transferred approximately 15% of the labor force to engage in diversified operations, organizing a total of 152 specialized teams. Large-scale and technically demanding specialized teams generally remain fixed and implement the "three guarantees" (guaranteed work, guaranteed output, guaranteed cost) and "four determinations" (determined leadership, task, quality, and time), specifically down to the group and the individual. At the same time, a flexible arrangement of labor is adopted by combining permanent specialized teams with mass temporary campaigns, and combining less emphasis during busy farming seasons with greater emphasis during slack farming seasons. During busy farming seasons, more than 85% of the labor force is guaranteed to engage in agricultural production, and during slack farming seasons, more labor is appropriately arranged to engage in diversified operations. Quota management has been strengthened, and many production projects have adopted methods such as recording work by the piece, recording points by output quality, and recording work by quota, organizing the masses to utilize spare time. For example, the raw materials and firewood required for boiling pine needle oil, as well as collecting and digging medicinal herbs, can be done by the masses incidentally during work breaks and spare time, saving a lot of labor. Many local people have the technology to make bamboo utensils, so they use evenings and work breaks to organize the masses to weave manure baskets and bamboo baskets, make carrying buckets, sharpen chopsticks, split scrub brushes, etc., giving full play to the labor enthusiasm of the masses.
    Another dispatch states that, when formulating this year's production plan, the Commune Party Committee of Shui Shi Commune made overall arrangements in accordance with local conditions, on the premise of ensuring the realization of the state plan. The first is to ensure increased grain production. Secondly, a large area of cash crops was planted in more than a dozen brigades near the Xiao River, such as Shui Shi. For example, the Dayaodong Brigade has more sandy soil, which is suitable for growing sugarcane and peanuts, so the planting area was expanded. The mountainous area is full of bamboo and trees, and oil tea is everywhere, so the Commune Party Committee vigorously led the masses to develop mountains and forests, reclaim oil tea mountains, and organize appropriate labor to raft timber, fell trees, manufacture wood and bamboo utensils, and boil pine needle oil. In animal husbandry production, the leadership of canteen pig raising was strengthened. The brigade breeding farm mainly raises sows to breed piglets, solving the problem of pig sources. Feed land has been allocated to commune members for private pig raising, and various feeds are now being sown. In addition, commune members are encouraged and assisted to raise more chickens and ducks, and professional fishing teams are organized.
    Another dispatch states that the supply and marketing departments of Shui Shi Commune have actively carried out business activities, opened up sales channels for various products, and organized production activities. For example, national procurement materials such as wild plants and medicinal herbs are organized through on-site visits. Physical exhibitions and forums with old farmers are used to exchange production experience and organize the masses to carry out production. In the past, they did not know how to make bamboo hats here. This year, the supply and marketing cooperative and the bamboo weaving cooperative organized three handicraft workers to study in Heting Commune. After returning, they taught the technology to major brigades and wove bamboo hats on a large scale. Since April of this year, the self-made bamboo hats in the commune not only meet the needs of the commune but can also be sold externally. In the past, the commune did not know how to weave grain sieves. Ouyang Songcui, a female cadre of the supply and marketing cooperative, led female commune members to weave grain sieves and went into the mountains to teach apprentices. The commune's marketable products are constantly increasing. Agricultural tools for the autumn harvest, such as baskets and drying mats, not only meet the needs of the commune but are also transferred externally in batches. (Attached picture)

    以农为主带动多种经营
    宁远县水市公社因地制宜全面发展生产
    据新湖南报消息　湖南宁远水市公社以粮食带头，获得农、林、牧、副、渔全面跃进的胜利。
    这个公社近三万亩早、中稻现在长得一片青绿，早稻已经抽穗扬花。五千亩夏薯扩种计划，已超额一倍完成。甘蔗、花生、棉花、黄麻、苧麻、百合、药材、西瓜等作物，正在加工培育。畜牧、水产正在加速发展，生猪平均每户一头多，鸡鸭鹅兔成群，家禽平均每户达七只。三个牧场饲养的二千五百四十多头大牛，膘肥肉满，池塘里放养了鲤鱼、草鱼和白鱼。真是“猪牛满圈、鸡鸭成群、鱼满池塘”。社、队经营副业共有三百五十八种，从1至5月，抓回现金七十五万多元，使公社有了充裕的农业生产资金，同时，月月发工资给社员，鼓舞了群众生产的积极性。
    又讯　水市公社党委在大抓粮食生产、全面发展多种经济的思想指导下，全面安排劳力和领导力量。第一书记和农业书记以主要力量抓粮食生产，畜牧水产和副业各有一个书记负责，林业生产有一个党委委员专管。干部都深入到生产队、作业组，参加生产领导生产。在劳力安排上，根据生产需要、技术高低、体力强弱，作适当安排。全公社抽调了约15％的劳力抓多种经营，共组织了一百五十二个专业队，大型的、技术性强的专业队，一般固定不动，实行三包（包工、包产、包成本）、四定（定领导、任务、质量、时间），具体到组到人。同时采用经常性的专业队与群众性的临时突击相结合，农忙少抓与农闲大抓相结合，对劳力进行灵活安排。农忙时保证85％以上劳力搞农事生产，农闲时适当多安排劳力抓多种经营。加强了定额管理，许多生产项目上采用按件记工、按产质记分、按定额记工等办法，组织群众利用空隙时间搞。如熬松针油所要的原料和柴火、采药挖药等，群众可以在收工时和闲空时顺带搞一下，节省了大量劳力。当地许多群众有制造竹器的技术，便利用晚上、工余时间组织群众织粪箕篾箩，打提桶，削筷子，劈刷把等，发挥了群众的劳动积极性。
    又讯　水市公社在制定今年的生产规划时，公社党委在保证实现国家计划的前提下，因地制宜地作了通盘安排。首先是保证粮食增产。其次在水市等靠近潇水的十多个大队种植了大片经济作物。例如大阳洞大队沙质土壤较多，适于种植甘蔗、花生，因此就扩大种植面积。山区竹木成林，油茶遍布，公社党委便大力领导群众开发山林，垦复油茶山，组织适当的劳力放簰、伐木，制造木、竹器，熬松针油等。在畜牧生产上加强了对食堂养猪的领导。大队饲养场以母猪为主，繁殖小猪，解决猪源问题。社员私人养猪已拨给饲料地，现正在播种各种饲料。另外，鼓励和协助社员多养鸡鸭，组织专业捕鱼队等。
    又讯　水市公社供销部门积极开展了业务活动，为各种产品打开销路，并组织生产活动。如野生植物、药材等国家收购物资，都通过现场参观。实物展览，找老农座谈等多种方式，交流生产经验，组织群众进行生产。这里过去不会打斗笠，今年供销社和竹篾器社组织了三个手工工人去禾亭公社学习，回来后向各大队传授技术，大织斗笠。从今年4月份起，社里自制的斗笠不但满足本社需要，还可外销。过去本社都不会织谷筛，供销社女干部欧阳松翠，即带女社员织谷筛，并且进山教徒弟。全公社商品性产品正在不断增加，秋收工具如萝筐、晒簟等，除满足本公社需要外，还成批外调。（附图片）
