The Corn Borer: A Major Pest of Coarse Grains
China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection

The corn borer is a major pest of coarse grain crops. Corn, sorghum, millet, and other crops suffer significant losses each year due to borer damage, especially in high-yielding fields with ample water and fertilizer, where corn borers lay the most eggs and cause the most severe damage.

Thorough control of the corn borer requires comprehensive measures, combining the treatment of overwintering larvae with field control. Last winter and this spring, some regions widely launched mass movements to treat stalks and stubble, eliminating overwintering corn borer larvae, and achieved great success. Six provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Beijing, adopted methods such as burning, chopping, crushing,沤 (a type of composting), fumigating, burying, and sealing to treat more than 90% of corn stalks. The Jin southeast region of Shanxi Province has basically achieved the requirement of "no stubble in the ground, no stalks in the fields." However, many other regions have not paid attention to this work. Last year, corn borers occurred widely and in large numbers, leaving many overwintering insects. If these are not treated thoroughly and promptly, the degree of harm when the first generation of moths emerges to lay eggs will be difficult to estimate.

This spring, the weather is warm, and the activity period of corn borers in the main corn-growing areas of the north is generally earlier. In Beijing, corn borers generally do not begin to pupate until late May, but this year, 6% of corn borers had pupated by May 10th; in Liaocheng and Heze areas of Shandong, corn borers did not begin to pupate until early May in previous years, but this year pupae were found in mid-April. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the time, mobilize the masses, and launch a comprehensive assault to thoroughly achieve "three no's" (no stalks, no stubble, no corncobs) and "five cleans" (clean homes, clean fields, clean villages, clean pens, clean fields), preventing overwintering moths from flying out to lay eggs. In the southern regions where corn borers have already begun to emerge as moths, field inspections should be strengthened, the appropriate timing should be grasped, and control should be carried out.

In the northern regions where most corn borers are still in the overwintering larval stage, the following control measures should be taken:

① In areas where fuel is not lacking, residual corn, sorghum, and other stalks, stubble, and host weeds should be used to smoke fertilizer or沤 compost, or piled up and burned to eliminate overwintering larvae or pupae.

② Stalks or corncobs used as dry fodder should be finely chopped or crushed and stored, or corn leaves should be stripped off for use as feed, and the remaining bare stalks should be treated promptly.

③ Windbreaks made of corn and sorghum stalks should also be dismantled and沤 composted or burned. Stalks already used for building houses should be coated with mud or pasted with paper to prevent corn borers from emerging as moths.

④ Corn stalks that must be kept for later use or cannot be completely processed can be sealed with mud (place stalks and corncobs in empty cellars or empty houses, seal the outside with mud, or directly smear mud on piles of stalks; the mud should be mixed with some grass, and the surface should be leveled with messy grass before applying mud one and a half to two inches thick).

Paper mills, distilleries, feed processing plants, and other units that use stalks and corncobs as raw materials have accumulated large quantities of stalks and corncobs, which will become centers for the spread of moths in the future. Special attention should be paid to this, and all possible measures should be taken to eliminate pests before they occur.

In the southern regions where corn borers have already begun to emerge, in addition to adopting the above measures to reduce the occurrence of moths, field inspections should be strengthened, forecasts should be made, and borers should be eliminated in the early stages of occurrence. Special attention should be paid to densely growing high-yield fields. During the peak egg-laying period of moths, depending on the insect situation, use 6% wettable BHC at a dilution of 1:600-800 to irrigate the heart leaves during the heart leaf stage, which is very effective. Each catty (500 grams) of liquid medicine can irrigate 40-50 plants. Pay attention to shaking when irrigating to prevent the medicine from settling and causing phytotoxicity. It is even better to spray the liquid medicine into the heart leaves with a sprayer. You can also use one catty of 6% BHC, mix it with 100 catties of fine soil to make toxic soil, and sprinkle it in the heart leaves for control. Corn borers on sorghum can be controlled in the same way; millet should be sprayed with a 200-fold dilution of 6% wettable BHC. After corn tasseling, 0.5% BHC powder should be sprayed or patted on the base of the leaf sheath and the female ear to eliminate larvae that bore into the stem and drill into the ear.

In terms of pesticide control, all localities should implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods. According to the experience of various localities last year, Derris root soap solution, wolfsbane, tobacco water, *Dicranostigma leptopodum*, wild gray vegetable, *Stephania japonica*, *Aconitum carmichaelii Debx.*, *Pueraria thomsonii*, *Rhododendron simsii Planch.*, *Rumex japonicus Houtt.*, smartweed and other plants are all effective indigenous pesticides for controlling corn borers and should be vigorously discovered and fully utilized.

    消灭杂粮大害虫——玉米螟
    中国农业科学院植物保护研究所
    玉米螟是杂粮作物的大害虫。玉米、高粱、谷子等作物每年因螟害所受的损失很大，特别是水肥充足、生长良好的丰产田，玉米螟产卵最多，危害也最严重。
    彻底防治玉米螟要采用综合性的措施，要把处理越冬寄生和田间防治结合起来。去冬今春一些地区普遍开展了群众性的处理秸秆、根茬，消灭玉米螟越冬幼虫的运动，取得了很大成绩。山西、河北、河南、山东、陕西、北京六省市采取了烧、铡、轧、沤、熏、埋、封等办法，处理玉米秸秆达90％以上。山西晋东南专区已基本上实现了“地无根茬，场无秸秆”的要求。但是还有很多地区没有重视这项工作。去年玉米螟普遍大量发生，留下越冬虫子很多，如不及时彻底处理，一等蛾子出来产卵，为害程度是难以估计的。
    今年春天气候暖和，北部主要玉米栽培区，玉米螟的活动时期普遍提早。北京一般年份5月下旬玉米螟才开始化蛹，今年5月10日已有6％的玉米螟化蛹；山东聊城及菏泽等地区往年5月初玉米螟才开始化蛹，今年4月中旬已发现有蛹。因此必须抓紧时间，发动群众，来一个全面大突击，彻底做到“三无”（无秸秆、无根茬、无穗轴）“五净”（家里干净、场园干净、村庄干净、圈里干净、田地干净），不使越冬蛾子有飞出产卵的机会。南部地区玉米螟已开始化蛾，应加强田间检查工作，掌握适期，进行防治。
    在玉米螟大部还在越冬幼虫期的北方地区，目前应采取如下的防治措施：
    ①在燃料不缺的地区，应利用残余玉米、高粱等秸秆、根茬及寄主杂草熏肥或沤粪，或堆集烧毁，以消灭越冬幼虫或蛹。
    ②作干草饲料用的秸秆或穗轴，应全部细铡或碾压存放，或将玉米叶子剥下，备作饲料，剩下的光秆及时加以处理。
    ③用玉米及高粱秸秆搭的风障，也应拆除，沤肥或烧毁。已作盖房用的秸秆，应在上面用泥涂抹或用纸糊严，以防玉米螟化蛾飞出。
    ④必须留作后用的玉米秆或实在处理不完的，可以泥封（将秸秆、穗轴放入空窖空屋，外面封泥，或直接在秸秆堆、垛上抹泥，泥中应掺些草，抹泥前先将表面用乱草塞平，使表面平整后，抹泥一寸半到两寸厚）。
    应用秸秆、穗轴作原料的造纸厂、酿酒厂、饲料加工厂等单位，积存的大量秸秆、穗轴，将成为日后蛾子传布的中心，要特别引起注意，用一切办法消灭害虫在发生以前。
    在玉米螟已经开始羽化的南方地区，除采用上面这些措施以减少蛾子发生外，应加强田间检查，做好预测预报，把螟虫消灭在初发生阶段，对生长茂密的丰产田，尤其需要注意。在蛾子产卵盛期，根据虫情，在心叶期用6％可湿性六六六1∶600—800倍液剂灌心叶，效果很好。每斤药液可灌四、五十株。灌时注意摇荡，不使药剂沉淀，以免引起药害。如用喷雾器向心叶内喷射药液则更好。也可使用6％六六六一斤，兑细土一百斤，拌成毒土，撒在心叶内防治。高粱上的玉米螟可用同样的方法防治；谷子应该用6％可湿性六六六二百倍液喷治。玉米抽穗以后，应在叶鞘基部，雌穗上喷布或拍撒0.5％六六六粉，消灭幼虫蛀茎钻穗。
    在药剂防治上，各地应贯彻土洋结合的方针。根据去年各地经验，鱼藤肥皂液、狼毒、烟草水、打破碗花花、野灰菜、藤黄、川乌、苦葛、闹羊花、土大黄、辣蓼等都是防治玉米螟有效的土农药，应该大力发掘，充分利用。
