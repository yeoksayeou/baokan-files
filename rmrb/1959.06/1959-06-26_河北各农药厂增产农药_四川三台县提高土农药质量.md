Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 24th: Pesticide factory workers in Hebei are actively increasing pesticide production to support rural areas. From January to May this year, factory workers have produced more than 22,000 tons of various pesticides. Among them are widely used "666" crude powder, the special medicine "1605" for treating cotton aphids and red spiders, and "Trichlorton", which not only supplied rural areas in Hebei Province, but also supported all parts of the country.

Since the beginning of this year, the increase in production activities of pesticide factory workers in Hebei Province has generally started with improving operating techniques and saving raw materials. Workers at the Tianjin Pesticide Factory successfully tested the use of phosphorus flake alkali to replace ethanol alkali in the production of the pesticide "1605". This can save 700 kilograms of the raw material "trichlorfon" per ton of pesticide, and the quality of the product is higher than in the past. The workshop producing "Trichlorton" in this factory changed manual feeding to air pump pressure feeding, and at the same time modified the distillation kettle to strengthen cooling and maintenance work, shortening the production process of "Trichlorton" from 72 hours to 18 hours. Due to the improvement of operating techniques, the production plan of "Trichlorton" has been overfulfilled every month, and the output in May increased more than three times compared with January. The "666" crude powder produced by Tianjin Chemical Plant is of very good quality. In order to reduce the consumption of raw materials, this factory promoted the low-temperature chlorination method, and the consumption of benzene per ton of "666" crude powder has been reduced to 177.4 kilograms. This consumption quota is also advanced in the country.

This newspaper reports: Sichuan Santai County has strengthened the research work of refining and purification, and has continuously improved the quality of pesticides on the basis of popularizing native pesticides this year.

At present, research institutions for refining pesticides have been established from the county to the people's communes. The county pesticide factory has successfully trial-produced more than 20 kinds of chemical pesticides using indigenous methods. After preliminary experiments and appraisals, they generally have the characteristics of high insecticidal efficiency, low cost, convenient transportation, storage and simple manufacturing. The central pesticide factories in most areas and some people's communes have learned to manufacture higher quality pesticides such as 1605, native rotenone, ferrous sulfate, nicotine sulfate, and DDT.

According to the spirit of the county party committee's vigorous development of native pesticides, all counties and the vast majority of people's communes are training technical forces and planning to build factories, while at the same time collecting raw materials in large quantities in conjunction with manure accumulation. The county has established 1,297 pesticide factories, and has produced more than 38 million catties of native pesticides.

### 河北各农药厂增产农药  四川三台县提高土农药质量

    河北各农药厂增产农药
    四川三台县提高土农药质量
    新华社天津24日电　河北各地农药工厂职工积极增产农药，支援农村。今年1月到5月份，各厂职工已经生产出各种农药二万二千多吨，其中用途广泛的“六六六”原粉，除治棉蚜虫、红蜘蛛的特效药“一六○五”和“敌百虫”等，不仅供应了河北省农村，还支援了全国各地。
    今年以来，河北省各农药工厂职工的增产活动，一般都从改进操作技术和节约原料着手。天津农药厂职工试验成功用磷片碱代替乙醇碱生产农药“一六○五”，每吨农药可以节约原料“三氯六磷”七百公斤，而且产品的质量比过去提高。这个厂生产“敌百虫”的车间把人工投料改为气泵压料，同时改装蒸馏釜，加强冷却与检修工作，使“敌百虫”的生产过程由七十二小时缩短到十八小时。由于操作技术的改进，“敌百虫”的产量计划月月超额完成，5月份的产量比1月份增加了三倍多。天津化工厂生产的“六六六”原粉质量很好。这个厂为了降低原料的消耗，推广了低温氯化的方法，每吨“六六六”原粉消耗的苯已经降到一七七点四公斤。这一消耗定额，在全国也是先进的。
    本报讯　四川三台县今年在普及土农药的基础上，加强了精制和提纯的研究工作，不断提高农药质量。
    目前，从县到人民公社，都成立了精制农药的研究机构。县农药厂已经用土办法试制成功了二十多种化学农药，经初步实验、鉴定，一般都具有杀虫效率高、成本低、便于运输贮存和制造简单的特点。大部地区和一部分人民公社的中心农药厂，都学会了制造一六○五、土鱼藤、硫酸亚铁、硫酸烟碱、滴滴涕等质量较高的农药。
    全县各区和绝大多数的人民公社，根据县委大力发展土农药的精神，一面训练技术力量和筹划建厂，一面结合积肥大量采集原料。全县已建立一千二百九十七个农药厂，已生产土农药三千八百余万斤。
