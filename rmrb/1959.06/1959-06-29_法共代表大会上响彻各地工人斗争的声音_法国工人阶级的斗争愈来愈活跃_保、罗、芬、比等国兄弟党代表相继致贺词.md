Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 27th: The French Communist Party Congress held plenary sessions this morning and evening.

    Boisseau, Secretary of the Seine Provincial Committee of the French Communist Party, spoke about the situation of workers in large aircraft factories and automobile factories. He pointed out that with the concentration of capital and the merger of companies, the exploitation of workers and the dismissal of workers are further intensified, and the living standards of workers are declining, while the profits of these enterprises have greatly increased. This situation has prompted workers to participate more and more actively in the struggle for their rights.

    Marchais, a representative of the Seine-Sud Provincial Committee of the French Communist Party, emphasized the crisis existing within the Socialist Party. He pointed out that in more than twenty localities in this region, the district committees of the Socialist Party have split into two, and district committees of the Independent Socialist Party have been established. These independent district committees of the Socialist Party still have differences with the French Communist Party, but this should not hinder taking united action. Marchais said: Efforts must continue to be made to win all Socialist Party workers to join the united front.

    Ansel spoke on behalf of the Seine-Nord Provincial Committee of the French Communist Party. He pointed out that in this province, the concentration of enterprises is accelerating, and the government is promoting this practice.

    Laurent Casanova, a member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, elaborated on the class content of the struggle against personal autocracy. He said: Not only do our enemies fiercely oppose this class view, but some allies do as well. However, this class view is necessary for the masses to rise up and take action against the scourge of government policies.

    Casanova recounted the actions taken by the French Communist Party since May 13 of last year, emphasizing the Party's persistent efforts to promote unity. He said, "We have always maintained our confidence in the people. We have said in clear language that once in contact with the harsh class reality of this regime, illusions will be dispelled." He pointed out that the masses have risen from the grassroots to fight for the realization of their own unity. Casanova then explained how changes in the balance of world forces and the progress of communism in France have led the bourgeoisie to adopt a more stubborn attitude. He said that because we are stronger, the struggle is more arduous.

    He pointed out: The people, who have accumulated experience in the struggle to establish a new democratic system, will increasingly realize that socialism is a national necessity. Everything ultimately depends on the French people themselves, and the great task of the Communists is to enlighten the people.

    Grigorov, the representative of the Bulgarian Communist Party, addressed the congress. Pierre Gott, representing the Progressive Republican Union, gave a congratulatory speech to the congress. Representatives from brother parties in Romania, Finland, Belgium, Sweden and other countries also gave speeches at the meeting on the 26th.

    法共代表大会上响彻各地工人斗争的声音
    法国工人阶级的斗争愈来愈活跃
    保、罗、芬、比等国兄弟党代表相继致贺词
    新华社巴黎27日电　法国共产党代表大会今天上午和晚间举行了全体会议。
    法共西塞纳省委员会书记波瓦梭在发言中谈到大飞机工厂和汽车工厂中工人的处境。他指出，随着资本的集中和公司的合并，对工人的剥削和解雇工人的情况进一步加剧，工人生活水平下降，而这些企业的利润却大大增加了。这种情况促使工人愈来愈活跃地参加为他们的权利而进行的斗争。
    法共南塞纳省委员会代表马尔歇的发言强调指出社会党内存在的危机。他指出，在这个地区的二十多个地方，社会党的区委员会分裂为二，成立了独立社会党的区委员会。这些独立社会党的区委会同法共仍然存在分歧，但是这不应当妨碍采取一致行动。马尔歇说：必须继续作出努力，来争取所有社会党的工人群众参加统一阵线。
    昂萨尔代表法共北塞纳省委员会发言。他指出，在这一省内，企业的集中正在加速进行，而政府助长这种做法。
    法共政治局委员洛朗·加桑诺瓦阐述了反对个人专权的斗争的阶级内容。他说：不仅我们的敌人激烈反对这种阶级观点，一些同盟者也是如此。然而，对于群众起来采取行动反对政府政策的祸害来说，这种阶级观点是必要的。
    加桑诺瓦追述了法共从去年5月13日以来所采取的行动，强调党的有利于团结的坚持不懈的努力。他说，我们始终保持着对人民的信心。我们用明确的语言说过，一经同这个政权的严酷的阶级现实接触，幻想就会消除。他指出，群众已经起来从基层争取实现自己的团结。加桑诺瓦接着说明，世界力量对比的变化、共产主义力量在法国的进展如何使资产阶级采取了更加顽固的态度。他说，由于我们更加强大，所以斗争就更为艰巨。
    他指出：在争取建立新的民主制度的斗争中积累了经验的人民，将日益认识到社会主义是全国的需要。一切最终取决于法国人民自己，共产党人的伟大任务是启发人民。
    保加利亚共产党代表格里戈罗夫向大会致词。皮埃尔·戈特代表进步共和联盟向大会致贺词。罗马尼亚、芬兰、比利时、瑞典等国兄弟党的代表也在26日会议上致词。
