    The United States is using the "Organization of American States" to carry out shameless intervention in the Cuban Revolution and the national independence movements in the Caribbean region.

    The "Organization of American States" was established in 1890, with the participation of the United States and twenty Latin American countries. This organization was initially called the "International Bureau of American Republics," renamed the "Pan American Union" in 1910, and reorganized as the "Organization of American States" in 1948. Since its establishment, it has held ten "Pan-American Conferences" and a series of various conferences, successively establishing the "Chapultepec Act," the "Rio de Janeiro Treaty," the "Washington Declaration," the "Collective Defense Act," the "Caracas Declaration," etc. All of this is for the purpose of interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, plundering and enslaving the Latin American people. Therefore, the "Organization of American States" has long been an important tool for the United States to invade Latin America.

    For many years, the United States has used this organization to suppress national independence movements in Latin America and support pro-American dictatorial regimes. In 1948, after the U.S. ruling clique overthrew the legitimate governments of Peru, Venezuela, and Costa Rica, it used the "Organization of American States" to force American countries to recognize the new reactionary governments. Particularly blatant was the subversion of the democratic government of Guatemala in 1954. At that time, the United States convened the Tenth Inter-American Conference, forcing other Latin American countries to pass the anti-communist resolution proposed by the United States, stipulating that if any American country established a so-called "political system of countries outside the continent," it would be "endangering American peace," and other American countries should take action to deal with it. Subsequently, the United States fabricated the lie that "a large number of weapons were shipped from Soviet-controlled territory to Guatemala," shipped a large number of munitions to Guatemala's neighbors Honduras and Nicaragua, brazenly imposed an armed blockade on Guatemala, and finally organized Guatemalan exiled military officers and armed forces led by Armas, an agent of the American United Fruit Company, to attack Guatemala and overthrow the Guatemalan democratic government.

### “美洲国家组织”

    “美洲国家组织”
    美国正在利用“美洲国家组织”对古巴革命和加勒比海地区的民族独立运动进行无耻的干涉。
    “美洲国家组织”成立于1890年，参加这个组织的有美国和二十个拉丁美洲国家。这个组织最初叫做“美洲各国商务局”，1910年改称“泛美联盟”，1948年又改组为“美洲国家组织”。从成立到现在已经举行了十次“泛美会议”和一系列各种名目繁多的会议，先后订立了“查普德庇克公约”、“里约热内卢公约”、“华盛顿宣言”、“集体防御案”、“加拉加斯宣言”等，这一切都是为了干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政，掠夺和奴役拉丁美洲人民。因此“美洲国家组织”早已成为美国侵略拉丁美洲的一个重要工具了。
    多少年来，美国一直利用这个组织镇压拉丁美洲的民族独立运动，扶植亲美的独裁政权。1948年美国统治集团颠复了合法的秘鲁、委内瑞拉、哥斯达黎加政府后，利用“美洲国家组织”强迫美洲各国承认新的反动政府。特别露骨的是1954年对危地马拉民主政府的颠复。当时，美国召开第十届美洲国家会议，强迫其他拉丁美洲国家通过美国所拟议的反共决议，规定如果有任何一个美洲国家成立了所谓“大陆以外国家的政治制度”就是“危害美洲和平”，其他美洲国家就应该采取行动来对付它。接着，美国就捏造什么“有大批武器从苏联控制的领土运往危地马拉”的谎言，把大批军火运往危地马拉的邻国洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜，悍然对危地马拉实行武装封锁，最后组织危地马拉流亡军官和以美国联合果品公司代理人阿马斯为首的武装力量进攻危地马拉，推翻了危地马拉民主政府。  （锡）（附图片）
