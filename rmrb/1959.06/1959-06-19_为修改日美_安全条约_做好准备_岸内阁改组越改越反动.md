    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: Kishi Nobusuke formed a third cabinet this afternoon that is even more pro-American in its coloring. The new cabinet members were sworn into office this evening.
    This reorganization of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet took place amid the Japanese people's increasingly strong opposition to the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the increasingly acute factional contradictions within the ruling party. The purpose of the reorganization is to establish a so-called "strong cabinet," stabilize the increasingly shaky foundation of the Kishi Nobusuke regime, and thereby realize the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the further revival of Japanese militarism according to the demands of the United States and Japanese monopoly capital.
    Hayato Ikeda, the leading figure of the former Yoshida Cabinet, which fell from power due to its pro-American policies, has joined the new cabinet as Minister of International Trade and Industry; Ikeda faction's Hideji Masutani has become Deputy Prime Minister (concurrently Director-General of the Administrative Management Agency).
    In this new cabinet of seventeen members, the Kishi Nobusuke faction occupies six important positions. Aiichiro Fujiyama continues to serve as Foreign Minister; Fujiyama is currently negotiating the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" with U.S. Ambassador MacArthur II. Kishi Nobusuke appointed Sekiya Ino, who was in charge of "colonial undertakings" in the Tojo Cabinet, as Minister of Justice, and made Watanabe Narahashi, a member of the House of Representatives, Minister of Transport. Kishi Nobusuke also transferred his confidant Munenori Akagi from Chief Cabinet Secretary to Director-General of the "Defense Agency," responsible for rearmament.
    Nobusuke Kishi's younger brother, Eisaku Sato, continues to hold the key post of Minister of Finance. The Sato faction is also represented in the cabinet by Yoshio Watanabe, former Deputy Secretary-General of the Yoshida Liberal Party (as Minister of Health and Welfare), and Reisaburo Matsuno, a major capitalist (as Minister of Labor).
    The remaining cabinet members are: Isamu Murakami and Kanjiro Ishihara of the Takeo Ohno faction, vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party, as Minister of Construction and Minister of State (concurrently Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission and Director-General of the Autonomy Agency), respectively; Takechiyo Matsuda and Yasuhiro Nakasone of the Ichiro Kono faction, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's General Council, as Minister of Education and Minister of State (concurrently Director-General of the Science and Technology Agency), respectively; Haruhiko Uetake of the former Ishibashi Tanzan faction as Minister of Posts and Telecommunications; and Kazutaro Kaneno of the former Kaishinto Miki Takeo-Matsumura Kenzo faction as Minister of State (Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency).
    The work of this cabinet reshuffle began on June 4, along with the replacement of leading cadres within the ruling party. In these ten days or so, the various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party engaged in fierce struggles for power. Although Kishi Nobusuke co-opted some figures from other factions within the party, he was unable to establish a so-called "all-party unity system." Ichiro Kono, the head of the powerful Kono faction, was angered by Kishi Nobusuke's insincere attempt to have him serve as the important Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party and resolutely refused Kishi Nobusuke's request for him to join the cabinet. Takeo Miki, the head of the Miki-Matsumura faction, also refused to join the cabinet. According to Japan's Jiji Press, the Ohno and Kono factions expressed "great dissatisfaction" with the new cabinet's personnel arrangements. Kyodo News reported that the Japanese business community believes that the new cabinet will be "more important" than the previous cabinet due to the participation of the Ikeda faction; however, some people "worry that the political situation may once again fall into a state of chaos due to the Kono faction's backlash."
    A commentary broadcast by Mainichi Broadcasting System on the cabinet reshuffle said: "There is no real cooperation here" but rather "an unstable balance."

### 为修改日美“安全条约”做好准备  岸内阁改组越改越反动

    为修改日美“安全条约”做好准备
    岸内阁改组越改越反动
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：岸信介今天下午组成了一个亲美色彩更加浓厚的第三次内阁。新阁员已经在今天晚上宣誓就职。
    岸信介内阁这次改组是在日本人民日益强烈地反对修改日美“安全条约”和执政党内派系矛盾日趋尖锐的情况下进行的。改组的目的是企图建立所谓“强有力的内阁”，稳定日益动摇的岸信介政权的基础，以便根据美国和日本垄断资本的要求实现修改日美“安全条约”和进一步复活日本军国主义。
    因执行亲美政策而倒台的前吉田内阁的首脑人物池田勇人参加了新内阁，担任通商产业相；池田派的益谷秀次担任了副首相（兼任行政管理厅长官）。
    在这个由十七人组成的新内阁中，岸信介派占据六个重要的职位。藤山爱一郎继续担任外务相，藤山目前正和美国大使麦克阿瑟第二在谈判修改日美“安全条约”。岸信介起用了曾经在东条内阁中负责“殖民事业”的拓务大臣井野硕哉担任法务相，并让众议员楢桥渡担任运输相。岸信介还让他的亲信赤城宗德由内阁官房长官改任负责重新武装的“防卫厅”长官。
    岸信介的胞弟佐藤荣作继续担任藏相（财政大臣）的要职。佐藤派参加内阁的还有前吉田自由党副干事长渡边良夫（任厚生相）和大资本家松野赖三（任劳动相）。
    其余的阁员是：自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦派的村上勇和石原干市郎分别担任建设相和国务相（兼任国家公安委员会委员长、自治厅长官）；前自由民主党总务会长河野一郎派的松田竹千代和中曾根康弘分别担任文部相和国务相（兼任科学技术厅长官）；前首相石桥湛山派的植竹春彦担任邮政相；前改进党三木武夫—松村谦三派的管野和太郎担任国务相（经济企划厅长官）。
    这次内阁改组的工作是和更换执政党内领导干部一起从6月4日开始的。在这十多天里，自由民主党内各派系展开了激烈的争夺权位的斗争。岸信介虽然拉拢了党内其他派系的一些人物，但是并没有能够建立所谓“全党一致体制”。有势力的河野派首脑河野一郎对岸信介假惺惺地要他担任重要的自由民主党干事长的花招感到恼怒，坚决拒绝了岸信介向他提出的参加内阁的要求。三木—松村派首脑三木武夫也拒绝参加内阁。据日本时事通讯社报道，对于新内阁的人事安排，大野和河野两派表示“非常不满”。共同社报道说，日本经济界认为，由于池田派参加新内阁，新内阁将比上次内阁“增加重要性”；但是，也有一些人“担心可能会由于河野派的反击而再次使政局陷于混乱状态”。
    每日广播电台广播关于内阁改组的评论说：“这里并没有真正的合作”而是“不稳定的平衡”。
