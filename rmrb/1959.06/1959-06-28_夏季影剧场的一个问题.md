    A Problem with Summer Movie Theaters
    Qin Li
    This summer, the capital's artistic performances are very active. Movies, operas, plays, music, dance, etc., are all blooming and vying for beauty, enriching the cultural life of the people in the capital more and more. I don't intend to comment on or recommend specific programs here, but just want to talk about a "small" problem.
    In recent years, the sanitation work in our movie theaters and theaters has improved greatly. The nationwide patriotic health campaign has been carried out vigorously throughout the country and has achieved great results. The cleaning and sanitation work of cinemas and theaters has naturally improved greatly. In the old days, these places were often particularly dirty, messy, and noisy. Now, management has been strengthened, equipment has been improved, attention has been paid to cleaning and sanitation, and theater order is much better.
    However, for some units that have not met these requirements, it is necessary to appeal once again: I hope to strengthen the work in this area, especially in the hot summer season. Recently, I watched an evening movie at a first-run cinema in Beijing. It was already dark, but no service personnel came to open the curtains in the theater. Only the audience members sitting near the windows made some ineffective efforts to open some of the curtains a little, while others could not be pulled open at all. It's such a pity that the vents that could let in fresh air and thus reduce the temperature inside the theater were blocked!
    Of course, the windows have to be closed during the daytime, but between each showing, the windows should be opened to air out the space.
    Generally, movie theaters only turn on the electric fans for a short time before the showing, and often turn them off after the showing. Under very hot conditions, is it possible to appropriately increase the operating time? The electricity consumed by turning on the electric fans is not too much. If the electric fans are turned on for too long, they will of course burn out, but they won't necessarily have to be turned off after just ten or fifteen minutes. Thrift is necessary, but it depends on the specific situation.
    In theaters, finding ways to improve ventilation and lower the temperature is not only of great benefit to the audience, but also necessary for the actors. They perform under the lights, often wearing thicker clothes...
    The phenomenon of littering fruit peels and paper scraps seems to be reviving in some individual movie theaters and theaters. The cleanliness of the venue, the cleanliness of the toilets, and the general order of the theater all need further attention. The audience should vigorously assist in this! The curtain has been raised, and the show has begun, let's all listen and watch carefully, and talk about it later!

    夏季影剧场的一个问题
    秦犁
    今年夏季首都的文艺演出十分活跃，电影、戏曲、话剧、音乐、舞蹈等等，百花齐放，争艳斗妍，首都人民的文化生活越来越丰富了。在这里，不打算对节目作评论推荐，只想就一个“小”问题谈一谈。
    几年来，我们的影剧场的卫生工作是大有改进的。全民性的爱国卫生运动，在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地展开，收到很大效果。影院剧场的清洁卫生工作自然也大有改进。在旧时代，这些场所往往是特别脏、乱、闹的。现在，管理工作加强了，设备改善了，清洁卫生工作也注意了，剧场秩序也好得多了。
    但是，对于某一些没有达到这些要求的单位，还需要再一次提出呼吁：希望加强这方面的工作，特别是在炎暑季节。最近，我在北京市内一家第一轮的影院看晚场电影。天已经黑了，可是场内的窗帘没有服务人员来打开，仅仅由坐得靠近窗口的观众不得其法地作了一些不很有效的努力，有几处窗帘被打开了一角，有几处则拉不动。原来可以流进新鲜空气、因而减低场内温度的通风口，被堵住了，多么可惜！
    当然，日场只好关窗，但是，各场次之间，应该打开窗子，透一下空气。
    一般惯例，影院的电扇只在放映前开一下，放映之后，就往往关闭。在十分炎热的条件下，是否可以酌量增加一些开放时间？开电扇所费的电力并不是太多的。电扇开得太久了，固然要烧坏，但也不至于十分钟、十几分钟就必须关掉。节约是必须的，但要看具体情况。
    在剧场里，设法改善通风情况，降低一些温度，不仅对观众有极大好处，对于演员，更是需要。他们是在灯光下演出，常常穿着较厚的衣服……
    果皮纸屑随地扔的现象，在个别影剧场里似乎有一些复活。场内的清洁，厕所的清洁，以及剧场的一般秩序，都需要进一步地加以注意，观众应该大力加以协助！幕拉开了，戏开演了，让我们大家好好儿听吧，看吧，有话回头再讲吧！
