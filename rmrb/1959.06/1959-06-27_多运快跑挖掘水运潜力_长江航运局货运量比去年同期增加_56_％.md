　　Maximize Shipping Volume and Speed to Tap Water Transport Potential
　　Yangtze River Shipping Bureau's Freight Volume Increases by 56% Compared to the Same Period Last Year
　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Yangtze River Shipping Administration's 60,000 employees, in the upsurge of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, are simultaneously advancing on all fronts, including ships, waterways, ports, shipyards, and organizational scheduling, concentrating their firepower, fiercely attacking the loss of transport capacity, and vigorously tapping transport potential. Significant achievements have already been made: From January to May, without increasing transport capacity, the completed freight volume increased by 56.52% compared to the same period last year.
　　Since the beginning of this year, the basic situation along the Yangtze River has been: high cargo volume and low transport capacity. After April, this contradiction became even more prominent. To improve this situation, the Party Committee of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau pointed out to the workers: on the one hand, the tasks are heavy and transport capacity is tight, and on the other hand, the loss of transport capacity is very serious. In the first quarter, the loss of transport capacity reached 109,000 tons of ships, of which the non-productive berthing time of ships in port accounted for 90,000 tons. Therefore, overcoming the loss of transport capacity and reducing the berthing time of ships in port has become the key to whether this year's tasks can be completed.
　　Starting in late March, all ports along the line conducted ideological work from leaders to workers at all levels, initially reversing the idea of emphasizing work shift efficiency and neglecting port berthing time. Many ports have strengthened their leadership over production, grasping it at every level and every day. The berthing time of ships has gradually been reduced, decreasing by 0.07 ton-days in May compared to April. In order to reduce the berthing time of ships in port, the crew members have actively carried out port-shipping cooperation activities. Recently, the People's No. 10 and No. 22 ships have installed light small tracks and small cranes, respectively, to assist port loading and unloading, increasing efficiency by more than double.
　　Improving operational organization is another important aspect of overcoming ship transport capacity losses. Poor ship-cargo connections and a lack of confidence in port throughput often lead to unnecessary transport capacity losses. At present, a dedicated line organization has been established, and according to different types of goods and flow directions, "five fixings" (fixed route, fixed ship, fixed cargo, fixed schedule, fixed dock) have been determined in the operational organization. The accuracy of ship arrivals and departures in May increased by 20% to 58% compared to April.

### 多运快跑挖掘水运潜力  长江航运局货运量比去年同期增加56％

    多运快跑挖掘水运潜力
    长江航运局货运量比去年同期增加56％
    本报讯　长江航运管理局六万职工，在以增产节约运动中，全线轮船、航道、港口、船厂、组织调度五路进军，集中火力，猛攻运力损失，大挖运输潜力，已取得显著成绩：1至5月在没有增加运力的情况下，完成货运量比去年同期增长56.52％。
    今年以来，长江全线的基本情况是：货多运力少。4月以后这个矛盾更为突出。为了改善这种状况，长江航务局党委向职工指出：一方面任务重、运力紧，另一方面运力损失却很严重。第一季度运力损失达十万九千吨船舶，其中船舶在港的非生产停泊时间损失达九万吨。因此战胜运力损失，压低船舶在港停泊时间就成为今年能不能完成任务的关键。
    从3月下旬开始，全线各港从领导到工人层层务虚，初步扭转了重工班效率、轻泊港时间的思想。不少港口加强了对生产的领导，做到层层抓、日日抓。船舶停港时间逐渐压缩，5月份比4月份下降零点零七吨天。为了压低船舶在港停泊时间，船员们积极开展了港航协作的活动，最近人民十号和二十二号轮船分别安装了轻便小轨道、小型起重机，协助港口装卸，功效提高一倍以上。
    改进运行组织，是战胜船舶运力损失的又一个重要方面。船、货衔接不好，港口通过能力心里没底，往往造成不必要的运力损失。目前已健全专线组织，并根据不同货种、流向，确定了运行组织中的“五定”（定线、定船、定货、定时刻、定码头）。5月份到发船准确性与4月比较提高20％到58％。
