Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, Paris: The French Communist Party's monthly publication "Communist Manual" for the fourth issue of 1959 published a document issued following talks held recently between delegations from the Portuguese Communist Party and the Spanish Communist Party. During the talks, the delegations exchanged experiences and information on the struggle for peace, democracy, and independence, and against the dictatorial regimes of Franco and Salazar.

    The document stated that the two party delegations exchanged views on the foreign policies of the Salazar and Franco governments, emphasizing that "the war policies of the two dictatorial governments, which serve imperialism, bring great danger to our countries." The document continued, stating that the Iberian Pact signed between Spain and Portugal is entirely a supplementary treaty to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, guaranteeing the United States the use of the Iberian Peninsula to realize its aggressive policies.

    The document emphasized that both parties agreed in their exchange of views that: "The national interests of Portugal and Spain require a complete change in the foreign policies of Franco and Salazar. All military agreements signed with the United States should be cancelled, and a policy of neutrality should be implemented." The two parties will make their utmost efforts to mobilize the people of both countries against the foreign policies of Franco and Salazar, and to strengthen the struggle for peace. The two parties expressed their support for the people struggling to liberate themselves from colonial oppression, and condemned the colonialist and aggressive policies of Franco and Salazar. This policy has caused bloodshed in Goa and Ifni.

    The document then exposed the aggressive and reactionary nature of the Iberian Pact, stating: "This treaty is not only a trump card in Atlantic strategy, but also a gendarme agreement, an agreement reached by the two dictators for the joint defense against the forces of freedom. These forces of freedom are developing in both Portugal and Spain, making it difficult for the Franco fascist regime and the Salazar fascist regime to cope." The document stated: "The Spanish Communist Party and the Portuguese Communist Party declare their determination to work towards establishing relations between the anti-Salazar and anti-Franco forces in both countries. The democratic cause of Spain is closely linked to the democratic cause of Portugal."

    After summarizing the recent progress made in the anti-dictatorial struggle in both countries, the document stated, "The two fraternal parties believe that, through the united struggle of the masses and the unity of the opposition forces, it is possible to end the Salazar and Franco dictatorships by peaceful means without civil war… The path of peace advocated by the two parties in this situation does not exclude, but rather requires, the strengthening of mass action and struggle in extremely different forms."

    The two parties then called on all humane people, whether Spanish or Portuguese, to demand an end to the suffering of the thousands of people arrested and exiled by the Salazar and Franco dictatorial governments. The document also pointed out that the great patriot, Álvaro Cunhal, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Portuguese Communist Party, remains imprisoned after serving his sentence. The document stated that the two parties will continue to work to launch a broad mass movement to secure a genuine amnesty for political prisoners and political exiles.

    The document reiterated that the two parties agree with the declaration of the twelve Communist and Workers' Parties issued in November 1957, and agree with the assessment that the development of the international situation favors the forces of peace and democracy. The two party delegations warmly congratulated the great achievements of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, remained loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and condemned the revisionist stance of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

    The document concluded: "In the spirit of proletarian internationalism and without prejudice to the integrity of our parties, the Spanish Communist Party and the Portuguese Communist Party reaffirm their unwavering determination to continue to strengthen the fraternal ties that unite our two parties."

    葡共和西共发表会谈文件
    并肩战斗反对两国独裁统治
    新华社24日讯　巴黎消息：法共“共产主义手册”月刊1959年第四期刊载了葡萄牙共产党代表团和西班牙共产党代表团不久前举行会谈后发表的文件。两党代表团在会谈中交流了争取和平、民主和独立，反对佛朗哥和萨拉查独裁政权的斗争经验和情报。
    文件说，两党代表团交换了对萨拉查和佛朗哥政府外交政策的看法，强调指出，“为帝国主义服务的两个独裁政府的战争政策给我们国家带来了极大的危险。”文件继续说，西班牙和葡萄牙之间签订的伊比利亚条约彻头彻尾是北大西洋公约的补充条约，它保证美国使用伊比利亚半岛以实现它的侵略政策。
    文件强调，两党在交换意见中一致认为：“葡萄牙和西班牙的民族利益要求彻底改变佛朗哥和萨拉查的外交政策。应该取消同美国签订的一切军事协定和实行中立政策。”两党将以最大努力，动员两国人民反对佛朗哥和萨拉查的外交政策，加强争取和平的斗争。两党表示支持为从殖民主义压迫下解放自己而斗争的人民，并谴责佛朗哥和萨拉查的殖民主义侵略政策。这种政策在果阿和伊夫尼造成了流血事件。
    文件接着揭露了伊比利亚条约的侵略与反动的性质，它说：“这个条约不仅是大西洋战略上的一张王牌，同时也是一个宪兵协定、是两个独裁者为共同防御自由力量的联合而达成的协议。这种自由力量在葡萄牙和在西班牙一样也发展起来，使佛朗哥法西斯政权和萨拉查法西斯政权难于对付。”文件说：“西班牙共产党和葡萄牙共产党声明决心为两国反萨拉查和反佛朗哥力量之间建立关系而努力。西班牙的民主事业同葡萄牙的民主事业是紧密相连的。”
    文件在总结了两国国内最近在反独裁斗争方面的进展以后说，“两个兄弟党认为：通过人民群众团结一致的斗争和反对力量的团结，有可能以非内战的和平方法结束萨拉查和佛朗哥独裁制度……两党在这个局势下所维护的和平道路并不排除，反而要在极其不同的形式下加强群众的行动和斗争。”
    两党接着号召一切有人性的人，不论是西班牙人还是葡萄牙人，都来要求结束那些被萨拉查和佛朗哥独裁政府逮捕和流放的成千上万的人们的痛苦。文件并指出，伟大的爱国者、葡萄牙共产党书记处书记阿尔瓦罗·库尼亚尔在服满徒刑后仍被监禁在牢中。文件说，两党将继续努力开展广泛的群众运动，使政治犯和政治流放者获得真正的大赦。
    文件重申，两党同意1957年11月发表的十二国共产党和工人党宣言，同意国际局势的发展有利于和平、民主力量这一估计。两党代表团热烈祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大成就，忠于马克思—列宁主义原则，谴责南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义立场。
    文件最后说：“根据无产阶级的国际主义精神和在不影响我们党的完整的情况下，西班牙共产党和葡萄牙共产党重申坚定不移地决心继续加强把我们两党团结在一起的兄弟般连系。”
