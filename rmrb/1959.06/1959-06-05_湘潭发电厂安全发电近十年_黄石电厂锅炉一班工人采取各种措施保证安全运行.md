Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 4th - The Xiangtan Power Plant in Hunan Province has had no personal injury accidents or fires since 1949, ensuring the normal supply of electricity for industrial and residential use.

This thermal power plant was built before liberation, and much of the equipment is relatively old. Since liberation, under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, the plant's employees have consistently regarded safe power supply as one of the factory's primary tasks. When factory leaders assign tasks to employees, they explain safety measures; when inspecting work, they also check safety conditions. In the event of near-miss accidents, they mobilize employees to carefully analyze the causes, point out the potential harm the accident could bring to the country, and develop measures to prevent accidents from happening.

To ensure that new workers do not have accidents, new workers at this plant receive systematic safety knowledge training from the technical safety department. Only after passing the test are they assigned to work in the workshops. In the workshops, experienced workers continue to be responsible for helping them quickly become familiar with the safety precautions to be observed in production.

This plant pays special attention to relying on the masses to ensure safe production. Production team leaders are all responsible for supervising safe operation, and each team has safety supervisors elected by the workers themselves. The plant also implements a "equipment zone responsibility maintenance system," dividing the plant's equipment into several zones according to work type, managed by the teams, and inspected regularly. Discovering hidden dangers and repairing them immediately has played a significant role in preventing accidents.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th - The workers of Boiler Team One of the Huangshi Power Plant have maintained safe operation for nine years and five months. For this, they were recently commended by the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

The eight workers in this team commonly recognize that a slight oversight in their operation can affect the normal operation of the steam engine and generator, causing power outages; in severe cases, it can even cause a boiler explosion. Therefore, they attach great importance to safety work. The team has established a core group with Party members as the backbone, studying the safety situation and the workers' ideological situation every half month. If they find that workers are not paying enough attention to safety production, they promptly remind them and help them solve some specific problems. They have established and adhere to the covenant of "sounding the alarm before work, checking more during work, and talking about safety after work." Before work every day, the team leader gives a brief overview of safe operation, and everyone reminds each other of the problems that should be paid attention to in production; workers check the equipment every fifteen minutes during operation and deal with abnormal situations in a timely manner; after work, they summarize the implementation of safety operation procedures, giving praise to those who perform well and criticism to those who perform poorly.

The workers in this team pay special attention to learning safety technology and operating procedures. Their learning methods include explaining procedure theory, conducting simulated accident drills, and analyzing the causes of accidents. After learning, they hold spot checks and regular exams.

    湘潭发电厂安全发电近十年
    黄石电厂锅炉一班工人采取各种措施保证安全运行
    新华社长沙4日电　湖南湘潭发电厂由1949年到现在没有发生过人身伤亡事故和火灾，保证了工业用电和民用电的正常供应。
    这个火力发电厂是解放前兴建的，许多设备比较陈旧。解放以来，这个厂的职工们在工厂党委的领导下一直把安全供电作为全厂的首要任务之一。工厂领导干部向职工交代任务的时候要交代安全措施；检查工作的时候，也要检查安全情况。遇有未遂事故，就发动职工认真分析它的原因，指出事故可能给国家带来的危害，并订出防止事故发生的办法。
    为了保证新工人不出事故，这个厂的新工人进厂后，先由技术安全部门系统地讲授安全知识，经过测验合格才分配到车间工作，到车间后，又由老工人继续包干负责帮助他们很快地熟悉了安全生产应注意的事项。
    这个厂特别注意依靠群众搞好安全生产。生产班组长人人都负有监督安全运行的责任，每个班组都有工人自己选出的安全监察员。全厂还实行了“设备专区责任维护制”，把全厂设备按工种划为几个专区，由班组管理，定期检查。发现隐患立即检修，对预防发生事故起了很大的作用。
    新华社武汉4日电　黄石电厂锅炉一班工人九年零五个月保持安全运转。为此，他们最近受到中共黄石市委的表扬。
    这个班的八个工人共同认识到，自己操作上的一点疏忽，都会影响蒸汽机和发电机的正常运转，造成停电事故；严重时还会引起锅炉爆炸，因此非常重视安全工作。班中建立了以党员为骨干的核心小组，每半个月研究一次安全情况和群众思想情况，发现工人对安全生产不够注意就及时提醒，并且帮助他们解决一些具体问题。他们订立和坚持执行了“上班敲警钟、班中多检查、班后谈安全”的公约。每天上班之前，由班长讲一遍安全操作概要，大家互相提醒生产中应该注意的问题；工人在操作中每隔十五分钟要检查一次设备，发现不正常情况及时处理；下班以后要总结执行安全操作规程的情况，对执行得好的给予表扬，坏的给予批评。
    这个班的工人特别注意学习安全技术和操作规程。他们的学习方法包括讲规程理论、举行假事故演习和分析发生事故的原因等。学习后要举行抽考和定期考试。
