Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, June 14th: The 2,596 mu of vegetables and 1,463 mu of qing稞 (highland barley) and wheat crops sown by the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region troops this year are generally growing well. Summer vegetables such as bok choy, radishes, leeks, and cucumbers planted by many units have already begun to be harvested and eaten.

In order to gradually change the situation of relying on the mainland for staple and non-staple foods, since entering Tibet, the Tibet Military Region troops have always regarded developing rural sideline production as an important task. The broad masses of officers and soldiers overcame difficulties such as water shortages in the plateau, thin soil layers, short frost-free periods, large day-night temperature differences, and frequent hailstorms, and reclaimed large areas of wasteland every year to grow various vegetables. By last year, they had achieved complete self-sufficiency in vegetables. This spring, after quickly putting down the Lhasa rebellion, the military region's leading organs established a production committee, calling on all officers and soldiers to thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits while developing agricultural and sideline production. While undertaking the arduous task of being both a combat team and a work team, all units assigned dedicated personnel to form production teams and completed the spring sowing of vegetables in a timely manner. The various anti-rebellion troops in the Shannan region also carried various vegetable seeds during their thousand-mile march from Tsetang to the foothills of the Himalayas, sowing wherever they went to eliminate bandits. Troops stationed in Damxung, Nagqu, Pari, and other places at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, adopted wind and sand prevention measures such as digging cellars, driving wooden stakes, and covering with straw curtains on newly reclaimed land to plant various cold-resistant vegetables, which are now growing very luxuriantly. In the large-scale greenhouses in the Lhasa area, eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, watermelons, and cantaloupes, which had never grown on the plateau in the past, are growing very well this year.

The people of the whole country and fraternal troops have provided strong support for the agricultural and sideline production of the troops stationed in Tibet. The cabbage, sugar beet seeds, and upland rice seeds suitable for growing in high-altitude and cold regions sent by the Shenyang troops, the wheat seeds and watermelon seeds sent by Henan, the Chinese cabbage seeds sent by Shandong, and the Hami melon seeds sent by Xinjiang, in addition to the upland rice which is being prepared for trial planting, these crops transplanted from the mainland are generally growing well.

In order to gradually solve the problem of meat self-sufficiency, all units have expanded livestock farms and accelerated the breeding of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks and other livestock and poultry. One of the three ranches under construction has been initially completed, raising 330 cattle and more than 670 sheep. Some units have also organized hunting teams to hunt wild game to increase the source of meat.

    逐渐改变靠内地供应主副食品的状况
    西藏军区部队大兴农副业
    山南平叛大军进剿到那里播种到那里
    新华社拉萨14日电　人民解放军西藏军区各部队今年播种的二千五百九十六亩蔬菜、一千四百六十三亩青稞和小麦等农作物，普遍生长良好。许多部队种植的小白菜、水萝卜、韭菜、黄瓜等夏菜，已经开始采摘食用。
    西藏军区各部队为了逐渐改变主副食品靠内地供应的状况，入藏以来，一直把开展农村副业生产当成一项重要任务。广大官兵战胜了高原缺水、土层薄、无霜期短、昼夜温差大以及时遭冰雹侵袭等困难，每年都开垦大片荒地种植各种蔬菜，到去年就实现了蔬菜全部自给。今年春季，在迅速平定拉萨叛乱以后，军区领导机关成立了生产委员会，号召全体官兵一面彻底肃清残余叛匪，一面发展农副业生产。各部队在担负着既是战斗队、又是工作队的繁重任务中，都抽出专人组成了生产队，及时完成了蔬菜春播。山南地区的各路平叛部队，在由泽当到喜马拉雅山麓的千里进军途中，也都携带着各种蔬菜种籽，进剿到那里，就播种到那里。驻在海拔四千多公尺的当雄、黑河、帕里等地部队，在新开垦的土地上，采用挖地窖、打木桩、盖草帘等防风沙的办法，种植了各种耐寒蔬菜，现在都生长得十分茁壮。在拉萨地区的大面积的温室里，培育的茄子、大椒、西红柿、西瓜、甜瓜等，过去从未在高原上生长过，今年长得很好。
    全国各地人民和兄弟部队，对驻藏部队的农副业生产进行大力支援。沈阳部队寄来的适合高寒地区生长的白菜、甜菜种子和旱稻种子，河南寄来的小麦种、西瓜种，山东寄来的大白菜种，新疆寄来的哈密瓜种等，除了旱稻正在准备试种外，这些自内地移植的作物普遍生长良好。
    为了逐步解决肉类自给，各部队扩大了畜牧场，加速繁殖牛、羊、猪、鸡、鸭等家畜、家禽。在筹建的三个牧场中一个已初步建成，饲养了三百三十头牛和六百七十多头羊。有的部队还组织打猎队猎取野味，增加肉食的来源。
