Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei, Fujian, Heilongjiang and other places are cleaning up the warehouses of industrial and commercial enterprises, and have discovered a large number of surplus and stagnant materials in inventory. After adjustment, these materials have been used in current production or sold on the market.

According to incomplete statistics from the industrial system in Shandong Province, since March, more than 4,000 tons of surplus steel, more than 1,600 cubic meters of wood, more than 700 tons of cement, more than 1,900 sets of mechanical and electrical equipment, more than 250 tons of explosives, and more than 70,000 detonators have been cleared from warehouses. In Harbin, hundreds of large and small factories have been cleaning up their warehouses since the end of March. By the end of May, they had cleared out more than 3,100 tons of various types of steel, more than 600 tons of silicon steel sheets, 1,000 tons of coke, nearly 5,000 sets of ball bearings, as well as a large number of cables, charcoal, mechanical parts, copper and other materials. The commercial system in Jiangsu Province has discovered that the potential of inventory materials in various places is considerable through warehouse cleanups. For example, the Jintan County Department Store sells an average of 1,000 meters of Serge and 50 meters of Labor Cloth per month; however, it has an inventory of 45,660 meters of Serge, which can be sold for 45 months, and an inventory of 12,000 meters of Labor Cloth, which can be sold for 20 years.

After cleaning up the warehouses, various localities have adopted various methods to exchange and adjust the materials so that these accumulated and stagnant materials can be used in production or supplied to consumers in a timely manner. Wuhan has carried out three levels of balance adjustment for the cleared materials in sequence: first, the grass-roots balance, that is, the balance between work sections and workshops within each enterprise; then the balance between factories; In early June, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee led a conference to conduct a comprehensive adjustment and balance throughout the city, adjusting tens of thousands of kinds of ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, chemical raw materials, building materials, mechanical equipment, machine parts and other materials. Commercial departments at all levels in Jiangsu Province organized rural grass-roots stores to transport high-grade daily-use industrial products and non-staple foods cleared from the warehouses to cities and industrial and mining areas, and cities transported commodities suitable for rural areas to rural areas, enriching the material supply forces in urban and rural areas. On the basis of inventory clearance, the commercial departments of various counties held a third-category commodity exchange meeting, turning the originally accumulated "dead goods" into "live goods."

After cleaning up the warehouses, the factory and store leaders in various places have clarified their assets. Many units have initially established some corresponding systems to prevent stockpiling, while verifying needs and saving on use. Through inventory clearance, the Xiamen No. 1 Machine Factory discovered 111 kinds of materials with "goods but no accounts" and "accounts but no goods." Therefore, they formulated a storage system for tools, materials, and products to eliminate this chaotic phenomenon of inconsistent accounts and goods. After clearing the warehouses and clarifying their assets, the commercial departments in Liaocheng City, Shandong Province, had a more reliable plan for opening up sources of goods and organizing production.

    山东江苏等地彻底清仓
    发掘呆滞物资调剂有无
    据新华社13日讯　山东、江苏、湖北、福建、黑龙江等地清理工商企业仓库，发掘出大批库存多余的呆滞的物资。这些物资经过调剂，已经用于当前的生产或在市场上销售。
    山东省工业系统据不完全统计，3月份以来从仓库中清理出多余的钢材四千多吨，木材一千六百多立方公尺，水泥七百多吨，机电设备一千九百多台，炸药二百五十多吨，雷管七万多支。哈尔滨市几百个大小工厂从3月末开始清理仓库，到5月底，共清理出各种钢材三千一百多吨，矽钢片六百多吨，焦炭一千吨，滚珠轴承近五千套，还有大批的电缆线、木炭、机械部件、紫铜等物资。江苏省商业系统通过清理仓库，发现各地库存物资的潜力相当大。例如：金坛县百货经理部每月平均销售哔叽一千公尺，销售劳动呢五十公尺；而库存哔叽达四万五千六百六十公尺，可以销四十五个月；库存劳动呢一万二千公尺，可以销二十年。
    各地在清理仓库后，采用多种方式交流调剂，使这些积压呆滞的物资及时用于生产或供应给消费者。武汉市把清理出来的物资依次进行三级平衡调剂：首先是基层平衡，即各企业内部工段与工段、车间与车间之间的平衡；接着在各厂之间平衡；6月上旬，中共武汉市委和市人民委员会领导召开大会，在全市范围内作全面的调剂平衡，调剂了黑色金属、有色金属、化工原料、建筑材料、机械设备、机器零件和其他物资器材共几万种。江苏省各级商业部门组织农村基层商店把清理出来的高级日用工业品、副食品运往城市和工矿区，城市把适销于农村的商品运往农村，充实了城乡的物资供应力量。各县商业部门在清仓排队的基础上召开了第三类商品交流会，把原来积压的“死货”变成了“活货”。
    经过清理仓库，各地的工厂和商店领导上摸清了家底，许多单位初步建立了一些相应的制度，防止积压，同时核实需要，节约使用。厦门市第一机器厂通过清仓，发现“有货无账”和“有账无货”的物资一百一十一种，于是他们制订了工具、材料、产品的保管制度，消灭这种账货不符的紊乱现象。山东聊城市商业部门清理仓库摸清家底后，在开辟货源、组织生产方面有了更可靠的计划。（附图片）
