On the Basic Methods of Agricultural Technology Reform
Zhao Ziyang, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Editor's Note: Reforming agricultural production technology is an important measure for implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and developing agricultural production in a faster, better, and more economical way. Over the past few years, agricultural leadership departments in various regions and the vast number of farmers across the country have made arduous efforts for this purpose, and have also taken winding roads. These experiences urgently need to be summarized in order to effectively improve agricultural technology reform work from the aspects of ideological understanding and working methods. The article by Comrade Zhao Ziyang published in this newspaper today is a good summary of this aspect of work.

I

Recently, many regions across the province have been conducting a major discussion on agricultural technology reform through summarizing last year's production experience. This is a work of great significance.

The issue of agricultural technology reform is currently the focus of discussion among cadres and the masses. How should the technical reforms of 1958 be evaluated? Where were the successful experiences? Where were the lessons of failure? How should we proceed in 1959? Correct conclusions need to be drawn. Experience in many areas has shown that as long as agricultural production increase measures are submitted to the masses for discussion, allowing cadres, technical personnel, and the masses to be together, allowing young, middle-aged, and elderly people to be together, fully developing democracy, and presenting their views without reservation, and engaging in debate, the successful experiences of the past year can certainly be affirmed, lessons can be found, and more reasonable production increase measures for this year can be formulated; the momentum can certainly be boosted, and the confidence to strive for even greater victories this year can be strengthened; and basic methods for carrying out agricultural technology reform can certainly be found.

Is it necessary to reform backward agricultural production technology? If this was still a question a few years ago, then it has now been largely resolved through several years of practice. The farmers' strong desire to achieve mechanization and electrification as soon as possible is a concentrated reflection of the demand for technological reform; and the farmers' enthusiastic welcome and use of new-style farm tools, moving from widely spaced planting to rational close planting, accepting advanced methods of rational irrigation and drainage and rational fertilization, etc., are all concrete manifestations of supporting technological reform. In the past few years, especially since last year, the masses have realized that to increase agricultural production, it is necessary to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and carry out comprehensive technical reforms in terms of soil, water conservancy, fertilizer, seeds, planting density specifications, field management, plant protection, tools, and so on. All of this is beyond doubt. However, how exactly should technological reform be carried out? How can the implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" be more in line with the requirements of achieving faster, better, and more economical results, and achieve greater economic benefits? Problems related to the methods of technological reform, such as these, still need to be further resolved by summarizing the experiences of the past few years, especially last year.

In the past few years, we have taken a winding road in agricultural technology reform. Before 1955, because the scattered small-peasant economy still occupied an absolute advantage, it was impossible to carry out large-scale technological reform. After the high tide of cooperativization, the relations of production underwent tremendous changes, powerfully promoting the reform of production technology, and a high tide of technological reform appeared in 1956. In that year, great achievements were made in promoting early sowing and early transplanting, sparse sowing and strong seedlings, close planting with small spacing, the selection of improved varieties, the promotion of new-style farm tools, and especially in the reform of backward farming systems. However, at that time, there were also certain shortcomings in determining technical measures in accordance with local conditions, and some people only saw the individual shortcomings in the great victory and exaggerated them, abandoning eating for fear of choking, losing confidence in technological reform. Thus, the pessimistic theory became popular, which produced the lesson of a saddle-shaped retreat in technological reform in 1957. In 1958, driven by the great situation of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communization, an even larger-scale technological reform movement appeared compared to 1956, and greater achievements were made, not only greatly improving the level of cultivation technology, creating a large number of high-yield examples of over a thousand jin per mu in one season, but also breaking a large number of superstitions and opening up broad paths for agricultural production. However, along with the great achievements, there were also some shortcomings, mainly the neglect of adapting to local conditions. When promoting certain major technical measures, the principles of "boldly mobilizing the masses, everything through experimentation" and "the combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses" were not fully observed, so some technical measures were not appropriate, the effects were not great, and even caused some losses. But these lessons, like the numerous successful experiences, are extremely beneficial to our agricultural production this year and in the future. As long as we correctly summarize them, we can certainly play a positive role.

This winding road illustrates that there is a struggle between two lines in the work of carrying out agricultural technology reform. When we promote new technical measures on a large scale, we are often prone to make subjectivist errors. Subjectivist errors are mainly manifested in violating the principle of "boldly mobilizing the masses, everything through experimentation," and rashly promoting some technical measures that have not been successfully tested locally and accepted by the masses, resulting in losses and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. When we emphasize adapting to local conditions, we are often prone to make right-leaning conservative errors. Right-leaning conservative errors are mainly manifested in not actively conducting experiments, not actively and resolutely promoting high-yield experiences that have been successfully tested locally, being content with the status quo, letting things drift, and passively waiting. From this, we are even more aware of the great significance of the basic line of "boldly mobilizing the masses, everything through experimentation" instructed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At the same time, from here we can also find a correct method for carrying out agricultural technology reform, implementing this method can both enable us to break the mystique of agricultural production increase, and enable us to pay attention to the complexity of agricultural production; and the technological reform can be carried out both actively and reliably, both with leadership and fully relying on the masses, both able to improve and able to popularize, truly in line with the principles of achieving faster, better, and more economical results. This method can be summarized as: actively conducting small-area high-yield experiments, while resolutely, systematically, and continuously summarizing and promoting local high-yield experiences, and focusing on summarizing and promoting local high-yield experiences. This is our basic method for carrying out technological reform. Correctly understanding and applying this method has great significance for the development of agricultural production both now and in the future.

II

Summarizing and promoting local high-yield experiences is a method of carrying out technological reform that is both active and reliable. Local high-yield experiences are suitable for local natural conditions, technical level, and farming habits, and are created and familiar to the local masses. This experience is high-yield experience, therefore it is active and advanced, promoting this experience can overcome right-leaning conservative errors; this experience is also local experience, therefore it is safe and reliable, promoting this experience can avoid subjectivist errors; this experience is easy for the masses to accept, therefore it is easy to promote, can quickly form conscious action of the masses, and continuously improve the technical level. In the past, when promoting a new technical measure, farmers often said they wanted to "see and then talk." Although seeing and then talking contains negative elements, it also makes some sense, because farmers always reform production technology through their own production practice, and accept new things on the basis of their own experience. This sentence also has great educational significance for our cadres, it tells us that we must use the method of summarizing and promoting local high-yield experiences, and use facts that the masses have heard and seen and are very familiar with to guide the farmers forward. In 1958, we had rich experience in agricultural technology reform, and there were high-yield fields in large areas or small areas everywhere. Correctly analyze the production conditions and technical measures of these high-yield fields, summarize the beneficial experiences, and use them on other land in the local area, which will form a mass technological reform movement climax that is both active and reliable, and greatly promote early rice and late rice production.

Summarizing and promoting local high-yield experiences is also a mass line working method that combines leadership and the masses. There must be Party leadership in the technology reform movement. Those absurd claims that the Communist Party cannot lead production and cannot lead technology reform are not worth refuting. May I ask, wasn't the great development in production since liberation achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party, and under whose leadership else? Recently, some comrades have shown a weak attitude in the face of certain shortcomings in technology reform, and even believe that leadership should be abandoned, which is extremely wrong. Without leadership in technology reform, there would be no Great Leap Forward in production and no victory in socialist construction. The question is: how to lead? What is the responsibility of leadership in technology reform? We believe that in technology reform, the correct leadership method must be and can only be the method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, and the responsibility of leadership lies in experimenting, discovering, summarizing, and promoting advanced experience, and at present, it is especially important to discover, summarize, and promote local high-yield experience. Last year, when promoting certain technical measures, we did not pay enough attention to the opinions of the masses and did not consult with the masses enough. Sometimes we often simply based our actions on the subjective intentions of the leaders. Certain unrealistic shortcomings in last year's work were produced in this way. Now we can avoid the blindness that may occur in our work by promoting advanced technology by summarizing local high-yield experiences, concentrating the wisdom and creativity of the masses, and then boldly mobilizing the masses and persevering. Therefore, summarizing and promoting local high-yield experiences is a mass line working method that combines leadership and the masses. In the process of summarizing and promoting local high-yield experiences, there will inevitably be a struggle between the advanced and the backward. Because all high-yield experiences are the result of correctly implementing advanced technical measures under local specific conditions, they are all opposed to local backward technologies. Because these experiences are native to the local area and come from the masses, it is entirely possible to use advanced ideas to persuade the backward through the masses' own personal experience, through on-site visits and typical demonstrations, so that the advanced experience can be accepted by the majority of the masses and technology reform can become a conscious action of the vast number of masses.

Is it somewhat passive to focus the work of technology reform on summarizing and promoting local high-yield experiences? Does it emphasize popularization and neglect improvement? No. On the contrary, it is precisely this method that can correctly solve the relationship between popularization and improvement in technology reform work, systematically and continuously improve the level of agricultural technology, and achieve a Great Leap Forward. Improvement and popularization in technology reform are inseparable from local conditions. Improvement must be an improvement in the overall production level of the local area; popularization must be the promotion of local existing high-yield experience. At present, our agricultural production level is extremely unbalanced. Whether viewed from the scope of the entire province, or from the scope of a special zone, a county, a commune, or even a production brigade or a production team, there are advanced, intermediate, and backward parts, and the distance between these three parts is very large. What we usually call first-class rice, second-class rice, and third-class rice is a popular way of describing this imbalance. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, there have been many high-yield fields with a yield of 1,000 jin of rice per mu in one season everywhere, and even more with a yield of 600 to 700 jin per mu, and there are also many with a yield of 400 to 500 jin or even 200 to 300 jin per mu. If we can seriously popularize the experience of a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, so that those with a yield of 600 to 700 jin, 400 to 500 jin, and 200 to 300 jin all look to 1,000 jin, this would be a remarkable Great Leap Forward. In the process of popularizing advanced experience, even more advanced experience will inevitably be created, and these even more advanced experiences will become the pacesetters for re-popularization. In this way, improvement, popularization; re-improvement, re-popularization, ... circulate repeatedly, endlessly, and each time a high-yield experience is summarized and promoted, our agricultural production level will be improved a step further. This is the concrete application of the principles of Marxist epistemology expounded by Chairman Mao in "On Practice" in the technological revolution. As long as we truly do this, the speed at which we promote advanced experience will be very fast, the speed at which we create even more advanced experience will also be very fast, and the speed of the leap forward in our agricultural production will inevitably be very fast.

Of course, there is a process from summarizing high-yield experience to promoting high-yield experience. The leadership should comprehensively consider the conditions required for promoting a certain high-yield experience, pay attention to the amount of work, pay attention to the comprehensive economic effect, properly arrange the labor force, and take overall consideration to balance it, and do not invest too much labor in one measure, affecting the comprehensive implementation of other measures. However, the more important responsibility of the leadership is to pay attention to overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas, giving full play to subjective initiative, and shortening this process. All successful experiences that are already in a position to be promoted locally must be resolutely promoted; if the conditions are not yet met, we must actively create conditions to strive for early promotion; everything that can be promoted this year must not be pushed to next year; as for some experiences that are not yet very successful, we must continue to experiment to achieve success.

Local high-yield experiences are by no means produced spontaneously or naturally. Therefore, emphasizing the summarization and promotion of local high-yield experiences does not exclude advanced experiences from other regions and scientific research results. Strictly speaking, many of our local high-yield experiences are not authentic local experiences, but are generated in long-term production practice, through direct or indirect methods, by absorbing advanced experiences from other regions and using scientific research results to a greater or lesser extent, plus their own creations. All high-yield experiences and scientific research results from other regions are advanced experiences generated under certain conditions and must be taken seriously. Therefore, it is necessary to actively introduce advanced experiences from other regions, cherish the research results of scientific and technological agencies, and even their own ideas. As long as they are reasonable, they should also be actively tested. Any complacency and passive attitude in this regard will lead to self-closure, bind their own hands and feet, and are extremely harmful. However, these things, before being proven by the local masses, are only the experiences of the masses in other regions and the experiences of scientific research institutions, or just an idea. To truly transform these experiences and certain ideas into local advanced experiences, they must first be tested to be mastered by the local masses; and only by becoming local experiences can they be promoted. Japonica rice grows very well and yields a lot in the north, but when it comes to the south, it often does not perform well in the first year. This year, a part of japonica rice varieties were promoted on a large area in the early rice crop of this province without a small amount of experimentation. Now it seems that the yield of some of them will not be very high. This is a lesson. But we cannot conclude from this that anything that has not been in the local area in the past will never be in the future. The problem is that everything must go through experimentation. Any advanced thing, as long as it has the conditions for promotion in the local area, can definitely become a local thing after being tested. Obviously, broad beans, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes are all foreign, and chemical fertilizers, automobiles, and tractors are also foreign. However, when the cultivation technology and operating technology are mastered by people, they will become native things and serve the local people. The principle is very simple. Although everything in the universe has its own personality, it also has commonality. As long as people grasp the commonality through the personality, they can recognize them and control them. To introduce advanced experience from other regions and adopt scientific research results, we should not be afraid of failure. It is impossible for scientific experiments to succeed without failure. The problem is that this kind of experiment should be carried out on small plots of land, and should not be promoted rashly before it is successful. In order to better accept experience and scientific research results from other regions, the best way is to strictly delineate the boundaries between experimental fields and high-yield fields. Each commune and even production brigade should set up experimental farms or experimental fields. All yield-increasing measures in terms of water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection, management, and labor should first be tested here before being promoted; and in the high-yield fields, the local high-yield experiences that have been summarized should be resolutely promoted in order to achieve a large area of bumper harvest.

III

In order to correctly summarize and promote local high-yield experiences, what work needs to be done?

First of all, in the rectification of the commune, in conjunction with the congress of commune members' representatives, a national discussion on technological reform should be carried out to carefully summarize last year's yield-increasing experience, and also to summarize the experience of the first half of this year. Correctly summarizing last year's experience and implementing the correct line of technological reform is an important link in further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. This issue must be faced squarely and resolved from the front. It must be affirmed that there was a great victory in 1958, but there were also many shortcomings and errors. Shortcomings and errors must be negated and never repeated; advantages and achievements must be affirmed and vigorously promoted. To correctly summarize the successful experience of 1958 (which is the main thing) and the lessons of failure, we must draw positive conclusions so that everyone can be full of confidence and courage to do a better job in this year's production. The two tendencies that exist at present are both wrong: one is to only see the achievements and not the shortcomings, so it is not easy to find the problems in the work, avoid losses that can be avoided, and do the work better; the other is to only see the shortcomings and not the achievements, so it is easy to lose the confidence to continue to move forward, and it is even impossible to do a good job. To overcome these tendencies, we cannot rely on empty principles, nor can we rely on administrative pressure. The best way is to conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological education by summarizing last year's high-yield experience. Therefore, during the congress of commune members' representatives, summarizing and promoting local high-yield experience should be an important topic for full discussion. In terms of method, we must boldly promote democracy and let all cadres and the masses express all their opinions. And we must first talk about the shortcomings, not label, not name names, not make typical criticisms, and even allow different opinions to be reserved. Individual people who are not ideologically aligned can even be allowed to demarcate small plots of land for opposite experiments. In short, we must ensure that everyone can speak freely and without any worries. However, more importantly, after examining the shortcomings, we must carefully summarize last year's high-yield experience so that people will not lose confidence because of exposing certain shortcomings in their work, and can see the possibility of a substantial increase in production through a large number of vivid facts, continue to muster their energy, and strive to achieve a greater leap forward this year.

When formulating the technical measures for the current field management and the technical measures for the late rice production, we must adopt the method of "three combinations." That is, let the leading cadres, technicians, and the masses combine to discuss and formulate various technical measures. We must pay attention to the experience and opinions of the technicians, which some areas did not do enough last year, and we should do better in the future. In the future, party committees at all levels should actively support scientific and technological departments in conducting experiments, and at the same time organize them to help the masses summarize local experience, so that scientific and technological skills can be combined with the creativity of the masses. The experience of old farmers should also be valued, absorbing the beneficial parts of it and serving production. However, the experience of old farmers should be respected and also improved. The respect for old farmers' experience should not be understood as the "old farmer line." In the discussion and formulation of this year's yield-increasing measures, there will inevitably be a struggle between the advanced and the backward. The responsibility of the leadership is to use the method of full reasoning to turn the advanced opinions of the masses into the opinions of the majority of the masses. After democratic discussion, finally act according to the opinions of the majority of the people. If the majority of the masses do not understand, they must also be good at waiting, and must never take the simple approach of administrative orders.

The purpose of summarizing and promoting local high-yield experience is to carry out a large-scale high-yield movement. Therefore, this work must be closely integrated with early rice production, especially with the preparation for late rice production, eliminating backward fields and backward rice, and achieving large-area balance. At present, there are experiences of 1,000 jin of rice per mu and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes in one season everywhere in the province, which is very valuable. These experiences were both created locally and do not require special measures, and can be fully promoted. The entire province should take "1,000 jin of rice and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes" as the battle slogan for the late rice crop, and summarize the local high-yield experience according to this target requirement, formulate measures, and resolutely implement them. As for high-yield experiments of 3,000 to 5,000 jin or 10,000 jin of rice per mu, and 30,000 to 50,000 jin of sweet potatoes, they should continue to be carried out, but only a part of the force should be used to carry out small-area experiments. Our main force must be invested in summarizing and promoting high-yield experience in order to achieve a large-area bumper harvest.

It should be seen that with the victory of the rectification movement, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers has been further mobilized. To guide this enthusiasm into production through the formulation and implementation of various yield-increasing measures, and to win a new victory in the Great Leap Forward this year, this is an important task of the entire Party on the agricultural front.

    论农业技术改革的基本方法
    中共广东省委书记　赵紫阳
    编者按：改革农业生产技术，是贯彻农业“八字宪法”、多快好省地发展农业生产的一项重要措施。几年来，各地农业领导部门和全国广大农民曾为此作过艰巨努力，也走过迂回曲折的道路。这些经验都极需总结，以便切实地把农业技术改革工作，从思想认识和工作方法方面提高一步。今天本报发表的赵紫阳同志的文章，就是对这方面工作的一次很好的总结。
    一
    最近全省许多地区，正在通过对去年生产经验的总结，开展着一场关于农业技术改革的大讨论。这是一件具有重大意义的工作。
    农业技术改革问题，是目前干部和群众的议论中心。对1958年的技术改革应当怎样估计？成功的经验在哪里？失败的教训又在哪里？1959年怎样搞法？都需要得出正确的结论。许多地区的经验证明，只要将农业增产措施交给群众讨论，让干部、技术人员和群众在一起，让青年人、中年人和老年人在一起，充分发扬民主，毫无保留地提出自己的看法，展开争论，就一定可以肯定去年的成功经验，找出教训，更合理地制定出今年的增产措施；一定可以鼓起劲头，坚定争取今年更大胜利的信心；而且一定可以寻找到进行农业技术改革的基本方法。
    落后的农业生产技术需不需要进行改革？如果说这在几年前还是一个问题的话，那么，经过几年的实践，现在大体上已经解决了。农民对早日实现机械化和电气化的强烈愿望，就是要求进行技术改革的集中反映；而农民热烈欢迎和使用新式农具，从大株疏植走向合理密植，接受合理排灌和合理施肥的先进方法等等，更是拥护技术改革的具体表现。几年来，特别是去年以来，群众已经认识到，要使农业增产，必须贯彻执行“八字宪法”，在土壤、水利、肥料、种子、密植规格、田间管理、植物保护、工具等方面进行全面的技术改革。所有这些都是不用怀疑的。但是，究竟怎样进行技术改革？怎样贯彻执行“八字宪法”才能更加符合多快好省的要求，取得更大的经济效益？属于这一类技术改革的方法上的问题，还需要从总结过去几年特别是去年的经验当中，去进一步地解决。
    几年来，我们在农业技术改革方面走过一条迂回曲折的道路。在1955年以前，由于当时分散的小农经济还占绝对优势，不可能进行大规模的技术改革。合作化高潮之后，生产关系起了巨大的变化，有力地推进了生产技术的改革，出现了1956年技术改革的高潮。那一年在推广早播早插、疏播壮秧、小株密植、选用良种和推广新式农具等方面，特别在改革落后耕作制度方面，取得了很大的成绩。但是，当时在因地制宜地确定技术措施方面，也存在着某些缺点，而一部分人只看到巨大胜利中的个别缺点，并加以夸大，因噎废食，对技术改革丧失信心，于是悲观论流行起来，这就产生了1957年在技术改革方面一度后退的马鞍形的教训。1958年，在大跃进和人民公社化这一伟大形势的推动下，又出现了较之1956年更大规模的技术改革运动，取得了更大的成绩，不仅大大提高了耕作技术水平，创造了大量一造亩产千斤以上的丰产事例，而且破除了一大批迷信，给农业生产开拓了宽广的道路。但是，伴随着巨大成绩而来的也还有一些缺点，这主要是忽略了因地制宜。在推广某些重大技术措施时，没有充分遵守“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”和
  “领导干部、技术人员、群众相结合”的原则，因而某些技术措施不够妥当，效果不大，甚至还造成一些损失。但是这些教训同大量的成功经验一样，对我们今年和今后的农业生产说来，都是极其有益的东西。只要我们正确地加以总结，就一定可以发挥积极的作用。
    这一条迂回曲折的道路，说明了在进行农业技术改革的工作中，存在着两条路线的斗争。当我们大面积推广新的技术措施的时候，往往容易发生主观主义的错误。主观主义的错误主要表现是违反“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的原则，把一些尚未经过当地试验成功并被群众乐意接受的技术措施，草率地贸然推广，结果造成损失，引起群众不满。当我们强调因地制宜的时候，又往往容易发生右倾保守主义的错误。右倾保守主义的错误主要表现在不去积极进行试验，对于当地已经试验成功的高产经验不去积极地坚决地推行，安于现状，放任自流，消极等待。从这里使我们更加认识到党中央和毛主席所指示的“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的这条基本路线的伟大意义。同时，从这里我们也就可以找到一种正确进行农业技术改革的方法，实行这种方法，既可以使我们破除农业增产的神秘论，又可以使我们重视农业生产的复杂性；而技术改革则进行得既积极又可靠，既有领导又能充分依靠群众，既能提高又能普及，真正符合多快好省的原则。这种方法概括说来就是：积极进行小面积的高产试验，同时坚决地、系统地、不间断地总结和推广当地的丰产经验，而且把总结和推广当地的丰产经验作为重点。这是我们进行技术改革的基本方法。正确理解和运用这个方法，对当前和今后农业生产的发展，有着重大的意义。
    二
    总结和推广当地的丰产经验，是既积极又可靠地进行技术改革的方法。当地的丰产经验是适合于当地的自然条件、技术水平和耕作习惯，又是当地群众所创造、所熟悉的。这种经验是丰产的经验，因而是积极的、先进的，推广这种经验，可以克服右倾保守主义的错误；这种经验又是当地的经验，因此是保险的、可靠的，推广这种经验，可以避免主观主义的错误；这种经验是容易为群众所接受的，因而是容易推广的，可以迅速形成群众自觉的行动，使技术水平不断提高起来。过去在推广某一项新的技术措施的时候，农民往往表示要“看过之后再说”。看过之后再说，虽然包含有消极成分在内，但是也有一定道理，因为农民总是通过自己的生产实践来改革生产技术，在自己的经验的基础上接受新事物的。这句话对于我们干部说来也有很大的教育意义，它告诉我们一定要通过总结和推广当地丰产经验的办法，用群众耳闻目见、十分熟悉的事实来引导农民前进。1958年我们在农业技术改革方面有丰富的经验，各地都有大面积的或者小面积的丰产田。正确地分析这些丰产田的生产条件、技术措施，总结出有益的经验，用到当地的其他土地上去，这就将形成一个既积极又可靠的群众性的技术改革运动高潮，大大推动早造和晚造生产。
    总结和推广当地的丰产经验，同时又是领导和群众相结合的群众路线的工作方法。在技术改革运动中必须有党的领导。那些攻击共产党不能领导生产，不能领导技术改革的滥调是不值得一驳的。试问解放以来生产上的大发展不是在共产党的领导下，又是在谁的领导下取得的呢？近来有些同志在技术改革的某些缺点面前表现了软弱的态度，甚至认为应当放弃领导，这是极端错误的。在技术改革中没有领导，就没有生产的大跃进，没有社会主义建设的胜利。问题是：如何领导？在技术改革中领导的责任是什么？我们认为，在技术改革中，正确的领导方法必须是而且只能是从群众中来到群众中去的方法，领导的责任就在于试验、发现、总结和推广先进的经验，在目前说来，尤其重要的是发现、总结和推广当地的丰产经验。去年推广某些技术措施的时候，我们对群众的意见重视不够，同群众商量不够，有时往往只是单纯地根据领导的主观意图办事。去年工作中某些不切合实际的缺点正是这样产生的。现在我们通过总结当地丰产经验的办法来推广先进技术，就可以避免工作中可能发生的盲目性，把群众的智慧和创造集中起来，然后放手发动群众，坚持下去。因此，总结和推广当地丰产经验，是领导和群众相结合的群众路线的工作方法。在总结和推广当地丰产经验的过程中，必然会有先进和落后的斗争。因为所有的丰产经验都是在当地具体条件下，正确贯彻执行先进的技术措施的结果，对当地的落后技术说来都是相对立的东西。由于这些经验是土生土长的，从群众中来的，因此完全可以通过群众自己的切身体会，通过现场参观、典型示范的办法，用先进说服落后，使先进经验为多数群众所接受，使技术改革成为广大群众自觉的行动。
    把进行技术改革工作的重点放在总结和推广当地丰产经验上面，是否有些消极呢？是否着重了普及而忽略了提高呢？不是。恰恰相反，正是这一个方法才能正确地解决技术改革工作中的普及与提高的关系，系统地、不断地提高农业技术水平，实现大跃进。技术改革中的提高与普及都离不开当地的条件。提高必须是当地整个生产水平的提高；普及必须是当地已有的丰产经验的推广。目前我们的农业生产水平异常不平衡。不论从全省范围看，或者从一个专区、一个县、一个公社、甚至一个生产大队、一个生产队的范围看，都存在着先进部分、中间部分和落后部分，而且这三个部分之间的距离很大。我们通常说的一类禾二类禾和三类禾，就是这种不平衡状况的通俗说法。去年大跃进以来，各地水稻一造亩产千斤的丰产田是很多的，而亩产六、七百斤的则更多，亩产四、五百斤甚至二、三百斤的也不少。如果我们能够认真普及亩产千斤的经验，使亩产六、七百斤，四、五百斤和二、三百斤的都向千斤看齐，这就是一个了不起的大跃进。在普及先进经验的过程中，必然要创造更先进的经验，这些更先进的经验又将成为再普及的标兵。这样，提高，普及；再提高，再普及，……循环往复，以至无穷，而每总结和推广一次丰产经验，就将把我们的农业生产水平提高一步。这就是毛主席在“实践论”中所阐述的马克思主义认识论的原理在技术革命中的具体运用。只要真正这样做，我们推广先进经验的速度将是很快的，创造更先进的经验的速度也将是很快的，我们的农业生产的跃进速度也必然是很快的。
    当然，从总结丰产经验到推广丰产经验，中间有一个过程。领导上应该通盘考虑推广某一个丰产经验所要具备的条件，注意工作量的大小，注意到综合的经济效果，妥善安排劳动力，统筹兼顾，使之平衡，不要因为在一项措施里投放太多的劳动力，影响了其他措施的全面贯彻。但是，领导上更重要的责任，是必须注意克服右倾保守思想，充分发挥主观能动性，缩短这个过程。一切成功的经验，凡是当地已经有条件推广的，必须坚决推广；条件尚不具备的，必须积极创造条件，争取早日推广，凡是能够在今年推广的，决不推到明年；至于一些还不十分成功的经验，也必须继续试验，求得成功。
    当地的丰产经验绝不是自流地、自发地产生的。因此，强调总结和推广当地的丰产经验，并不排斥外地的先进经验和科学研究成果。严格地说，我们许多地方的丰产经验，都不是地道的经验，而是在长期的生产实践中，通过直接的办法或间接的办法，或多或少地吸收外地先进经验和使用科学研究成果，再加上自己的创造而产生的。一切外地的丰产经验和科学研究成果，都是在一定条件下产生的先进经验，必须认真重视，因此要积极引进外地的先进经验，珍视科学技术机关的研究成果，甚至是自己的设想，只要有道理，也要积极试验。在这方面存在的任何自满情绪和消极态度，都将故步自封，束缚住自己的手脚，是极端有害的。但是，这些东西在没有被当地群众所证明之前，都还只是外地群众的经验和科学研究机关的经验，或者只是一种设想。要把这些经验和某种设想真正变成为本地的先进经验，必须首先经过试验，使之为当地群众所掌握；也只有变成为本地的经验，然后才可以推广。粳稻在北方生长很好，产量很高，到南方来，第一年却往往表现不好。今年早造本省没有经过小量试验就大面积地推广了一部分粳稻品种，现在看来，有一部分产量不会很高。这是一个教训。但是不能因此得出结论说凡是本地过去没有的东西，今后也永远不会有。问题在于一切经过试验。任何先进的东西，只要本地有条件推广，经过试验之后就一定可以成为本地的东西。很显然，胡豆、番薯、西红柿都是外来的，化肥、汽车、拖拉机也是外来的，但是，当栽培技术和操作技术被人们掌握以后，就会成为土生土长的东西，服务于当地的人民。其中道理很简单，宇宙万物虽然都有自己的个性，但同时也有共性，只要通过个性掌握到共性，人们就可以认识它们，支配它们。要引进外地先进经验和采用科学研究成果，就不要害怕失败，科学试验不经过失败而能得到成功是不可能的。问题是这种试验应当在小块土地上进行，没有成功之前，不要贸然推广。为了更好地接受外地经验和科学研究成果，最好的办法是严格划清试验田和丰产田的界线。各个公社以至生产大队，都设立试验场或试验田，所有关于水、肥、土、种、密、保、管、工等方面的一切增产措施都首先在这里经过试验，然后再去推广；而在丰产田里则坚决推广经过总结的本地的丰产经验，以便取得大面积的丰收。
    三
    为了正确总结和推广当地的丰产经验，需要进行哪些工作呢？
    首先，要在整社中，结合社员代表大会，开展一个关于技术改革的全民大讨论，认真总结去年的增产经验，同时也要总结今年上半年的经验。正确总结去年的经验，贯彻执行技术改革的正确路线，是进一步调动群众积极性的一个重要环节。必须正视这个问题，从正面加以解决。要肯定1958年有巨大胜利，但是也有不少缺点和错误。缺点和错误必须否定，决不重复；优点和成绩必须肯定，而且大力发扬。正确地总结1958年的成功经验
  （这是主要的）和失败教训，必须得出积极的结论，使大家信心十足，勇气百倍地把今年的生产搞得更好。目前存在的两种倾向都是不对的：一种是光看成绩，不看缺点，这样就不容易找出工作中的问题，避免可以避免的损失，把工作做得更好；另一种是光看缺点，不看成绩，这样就容易丧失继续前进的信心，更不可能做好工作。要克服这些倾向，不能靠空洞的道理，也不能靠行政压力，最好的办法是通过总结去年的丰产经验，进行深入细致的思想教育。因此，在社员代表大会期间，要把总结和推广当地丰产经验作为一个重要议题，充分开展讨论。在方法上要放手发扬民主，让全体干部和群众把心里的意见全部讲出来。而且要先讲缺点，不扣帽子，不点名，不作典型批判，还允许保留不同的意见，个别思想不通的，还可以允许划出小块土地作对立面的试验。总之一定要使大家畅所欲言，毫无顾虑。但是，更重要的是要在检查了缺点之后，很好地总结去年的丰产经验，使人们不致因为揭露工作中的某些缺点而丧失信心，能够通过大量生动的事实，看到大幅度增产的可能性，继续鼓足干劲，为实现今年的更大跃进而斗争。
    在制定当前田间管理的技术措施和晚造生产的技术措施的时候，必须采取“三结合”的办法。即是让领导干部、技术人员和群众结合起来，共同讨论和制定各项技术措施，要重视技术人员的经验和意见，这一点去年有些地区做的也是不够的，今后应当做的更好一些。今后各级党委要积极支持科学技术部门进行试验，同时要组织他们帮助群众总结当地经验，使科学技术和群众的创造结合起来。对老农的经验也应当重视，吸收其中有益的部分，为生产服务。但是对老农的经验要尊重，也要提高，不能把尊重老农的经验理解为“老农路线”。在讨论和制定今年的增产措施时，必然会有先进和落后的斗争，领导的责任是要用充分说理的办法，把群众的先进意见变成多数群众的意见。经过民主讨论，最后按多数人的意见办事。如果多数群众不通，还必须善于等待，决不能采取行政命令的简单做法。
    总结和推广当地的丰产经验的目的，是为了开展大面积高产运动。因此必须把这一工作同早造生产特别是同晚造备耕工作紧密结合起来，消灭落后田、落后禾，达到大面积平衡。目前，全省各地都有一造亩产千斤水稻、万斤番薯的经验，这是十分宝贵的。这些经验既是本地创造的，又无需特殊措施，完全可以推广。全省应当把“千斤水稻万斤薯”作为晚造的战斗口号，根据这个指标要求，来总结当地丰产经验，订出措施，坚决加以贯彻执行。至于亩产水稻三、五千斤、一万斤，番薯三、五万斤的高产试验，仍应继续进行，但是，只能以一部分力量进行小面积的试验，我们的主要力量必须投放到总结和推广丰产经验上面，以取得大面积的丰收。
    应当看到，随着整社运动的胜利，广大农民群众的积极性已经进一步调动起来。通过各种增产措施的制定和贯彻执行，把这种积极性引导到生产上来，夺取今年新的大跃进的胜利，这就是全党在农业战线上的一项重要任务。
