    Shanghai
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th) More than 1,400 representatives from all sectors of Shanghai held a grand rally today, representing the 10 million people of Shanghai in resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Korean people demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

    Jin Zhonghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said: The Korean armistice has been in place for six years, but the two parts of Korea are still divided. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is galloping forward on the road of socialism with the heroic posture of riding a Chollima, while in South Korea under U.S. military occupation, the economy is bankrupt everywhere, the people are struggling to survive, and the people are in dire straits. He also severely condemned the U.S. invading forces for setting up military bases everywhere in South Korea and constantly conducting war provocations against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He said: Countless facts prove that U.S. imperialism is the most dangerous enemy of the Korean people and the most serious threat to peace in Asia and the world. The U.S. invading forces must get out of South Korea. Jin Zhonghua expressed his firm belief that, with the support of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, and under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, the Korean people's just struggle against U.S. aggression will surely win final victory, and the peaceful reunification of Korea's 3,000 li of beautiful rivers and mountains will be realized.

    Subsequently, the heads of the Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations spoke at the meeting one after another, unanimously expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Korean people demanding the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

    Kim Jang-jeon and Moon Eung-myeon, representatives of Korean interns and students in Shanghai, also spoke at the meeting.

    Finally, the congress unanimously passed a telegram to the Korean people, supporting the just struggle of the Korean people.

    Shenyang
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th) People from all walks of life in Shenyang and Andong cities in Liaoning Province held rallies yesterday, respectively, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Korean people demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the realization of peaceful reunification of Korea.

    At the conference held by more than 1,200 people from all walks of life in Shenyang, Zhu Weiren, Chairman of the Shenyang Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, said that China and Korea are connected by land, and the people of the two countries fought side by side against the U.S. aggressors, with combat friendship forged with blood and common interests of interdependence. The more than six million people of Shenyang, like the people of the whole country, resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. invading troops from South Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea. Kim Yong-bin, Consul General of Korea in Shenyang, and Deputy Consul Zheng Feng-gyu were invited to attend the meeting, and Kim Yong-bin spoke at the meeting. He gave a detailed introduction to the tragic living conditions of the people in South Korea under U.S. military occupation, who are experiencing economic bankruptcy and struggling to survive. He said that the misfortune and suffering of the people in South Korea caused by the U.S. military occupation can no longer be tolerated. For the unification of the Korean territory, and for the people of South Korea to get rid of the dark rule, all the Korean people will always hold high the banner of striving for the independent unification and freedom of their motherland and move forward courageously.

    Wu Jiaxiang, Chairman of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Zhang Hongjun, Chairman of the Shenyang Youth Federation, and Li Xin, Vice Chairman of the Shenyang Women's Federation, also spoke at the meeting.

    Andong
    More than 1,500 people from all walks of life in Andong City, which is across the river from Sinuiju, Korea, held a conference yesterday morning. Duan Yongjie, Chairman of the Andong Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said at the meeting that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is a prerequisite for the realization of peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers have all withdrawn from Korea, but the U.S. invading troops have been lingering in South Korea, constantly undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement and creating tension in Korea and the Far East. Duan Yongjie said that the people of Andong, who were once at the forefront of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely support the Korean people's struggle for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the realization of peaceful reunification of Korea until the Korean people's struggle wins victory.

    Feng Naichao, Chairman of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, severely condemned the U.S. invading forces for lingering in South Korea six years after the signing of the armistice agreement, and for intensifying their efforts to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    Lin Qiangyun, Chairman of the Guangdong Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, continued his speech, pointing out that the Korean people's struggle for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of their motherland is not only in line with the interests of the Korean people, but also in line with the interests of maintaining peace in Asia and the world. The people of Guangdong Province expressed their firm support.

    Kim Kwang-seon, a Korean friend in Guangzhou, attended the conference. He cited a large number of facts over the past nine years, especially recently, proving that the U.S. imperialists are implementing a vicious colonial policy in South Korea and are the chief culprit in undermining the peaceful reunification of Korea. He pointed out that only by forcing the U.S. invading forces to get out of South Korea can the peaceful reunification of Korea be realized.

    Representatives from the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City organizations of various democratic parties and representatives from the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City federations of trade unions, women's federations, and youth federations also spoke at the meeting, unanimously supporting the just struggle of the Korean people.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 25th) More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Jilin Province and Changchun City held a grand rally this afternoon, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Korean people. Guan Quanyan, Chairman of the Jilin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, severely condemned the U.S. imperialists for continuing to occupy South Korea by armed force, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, violating the armistice agreement, creating tension, and the serious crimes of oppressing and enslaving the South Korean people. He said: The people of Jilin Province and Changchun City, like the people of the whole country, resolutely support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and resolutely demand that the U.S. invading troops get out of South Korea.
