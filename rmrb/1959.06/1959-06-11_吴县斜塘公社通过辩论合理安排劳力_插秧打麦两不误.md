This newspaper reports from Nanjing on June 10th: The Xietang People's Commune Party Committee in Wuxian County went deep into the issue, helping production team cadres resolve the contradiction of "two urgent tasks" during the summer busy season, ensuring timely summer planting and preventing summer harvest from being damaged by rain.

This commune is a rice-wheat double-cropping area. The current agricultural situation is that over 18,000 mu of wheat has already been reaped by June 2nd and needs to be threshed quickly while the weather is good. In addition, most of these wheat fields need to be transplanted with rice seedlings, and the tasks of plowing, irrigating, and transplanting seedlings must be completed within seven days before the summer solstice. Therefore, summer harvesting and summer planting are both urgent, the agricultural work is heavy, and it is difficult to arrange labor. The commune party committee initially mobilized each team to use 80% of its labor force for summer planting, and to extract 20% of the labor force for wheat threshing, as well as weeding, hoeing, and topdressing of a small number of double-cropping early rice fields. After the tasks were assigned, most production teams did not act according to this plan. When Li Wenyuan, the vice-director of the commune, inspected work in the Third Brigade, he found that the cadres and members of each production team in this brigade were busy with summer planting during the day, and although the weather was good, no one was threshing the wheat on the threshing ground. After discovering this problem, he and the brigade party branch secretary and brigade leader went to understand the reasons separately, only to find out that the team cadres thought that the work should be cleared stage by stage. It was not too late to thresh the wheat after the summer planting was finished. They said: "Transplanting seedlings must seize the time; one day earlier is one day better. The wheat has already been harvested and brought to the field. The spikes are not damp, and the wheat piles are well covered with straw mats. They will not spoil if piled there for half a month." Some commune members said: "Wheat will only produce wheat moths after the summer solstice if it is threshed, and there is no problem as long as it is threshed before the summer solstice." Some also said, "If two eels cross, you can only catch one." The meaning of this sentence is that summer harvesting and summer planting are both urgent, so you can only grab one; it is impossible to take care of both. In addition, some team cadres attached more importance to wheat threshing, but their method of solving the problem was to rely on overtime at night. Wu Jia-kun, the captain of the Third Team, said: "Transplanting seedlings during the day and threshing at night is the best method."

After Vice-Director Li and the brigade cadres thoroughly understood the ideological situation, they convened a meeting of the team cadres of the Third Brigade on the evening of the 6th to study how to solve the contradiction of "two urgent tasks" during the summer busy season. At the beginning of the meeting, Vice-Director Li proposed three methods of arranging labor for everyone to discuss. The first method was "clear stage by stage", that is, do one thing, clear one thing, first busy with summer planting, then threshing after summer planting is completed, and then busy with the weeding, hoeing, and topdressing of early rice; the second method was "concentrate on the center (summer planting as the center) and grasp both ends (wheat threshing and field management of early rice)"; the third method was "summer planting as the center, extracting the gap at night to thresh, and postponing the weeding, hoeing, and topdressing of a small number of early rice fields." After these methods were proposed, they aroused heated debate among the team cadres. Zhu Zhaoquan, the captain of the Seventh Team, said: "The first method is good. Agricultural work is 'clear stage by stage'. The leadership is concentrated, and the labor force is also concentrated, so the summer planting task is completed quickly." Zhang Fugen, a team cadre of the Eleventh Team, said: "Summer planting is important, but wheat threshing is also very important. I don't agree with 'clear stage by stage'. I agree with the third method, being busy with summer planting during the day and threshing at night, which is the best of both worlds." Zhou Ashi, the captain of the Eighth Team, opposed the opinions of the previous two people. He agreed with the leadership method of "concentrating on the center and grasping both ends." He said that this method has three benefits: (1) Extracting a small number of laborers to busy themselves with threshing during the day has little impact on summer planting; (2) There are not many wheat threshing tools, and extracting a small number of people to thresh can alleviate the tense situation of agricultural tools; (3) Threshing during the day can catch the sun and dry the wheat, making the wheat brittle and saving labor during threshing. Zhang Yuanfu, the captain of the Ninth Team, said: "There are not many wheat threshing floors in our team, which forced me to use the second method. If there were more threshing tools, I would still advocate using the third method, being busy with transplanting seedlings together during the day and threshing together at night." At this time, opinions on the meeting were inconsistent, and each stated their reasons. The brigade cadres asked everyone to further discuss: "See which method can both complete the various production tasks and take care of the commune members' sufficient sleep time? Which method is more adaptable to the changeable weather during the plum rain season?" Zhou Ashi, the captain of the Eighth Team, firmly believed that the second method was good. He said: "Transplanting seedlings during the day and threshing at night is not beneficial to summer planting, because the commune members are overly tired at night, and the work efficiency will not be high the next day." Shen Gensheng, a team cadre of the Fifth Team, also felt that threshing at night was not good enough. He said: "Threshing at night makes agricultural work easy to be rough, which is not conducive to careful harvesting and meticulous threshing." Some also said: "To get a real bumper harvest of wheat, threshing is the last hurdle. Therefore, people must be extracted to thresh during the day. If we wait until the seedlings are transplanted before threshing, we will miss the good weather, and if we encounter continuous overcast and rainy weather, it will be a disaster." After a heated debate analyzing the situation and comparing the pros and cons, the ideological understanding of the team cadres tended to be unified, and everyone agreed to use the leadership method of "concentrating on the center and grasping both ends" to solve the contradiction of two urgent tasks. On the spot, the cadres of each team revised the small-segment plan. The method of division of labor was: the formal captain grasped summer planting, the deputy captain grasped wheat threshing work, and each team extracted about ten laborers (some strong and some weak) to carry out threshing during the day. More than 600 people in the whole brigade are busy with summer planting, and 110 people are busy with wheat threshing. It is estimated that the whole brigade can complete the summer planting task on June 15, and complete the threshing task before the 16th. Appropriate arrangements have also been made for the field management of early rice. (Liang Guangjing) (Attached picture)

### 吴县斜塘公社通过辩论合理安排劳力  插秧打麦两不误

    吴县斜塘公社通过辩论合理安排劳力
    插秧打麦两不误
    本报南京10日电　江苏省吴县斜塘人民公社党委会深入一点，帮助生产小队干部解决夏忙期间农活“两头急”的矛盾，保证夏种及时，夏收不遭雨害。
    这个公社是稻麦连作地区。当前农活的情况是：一万八千多亩小麦已经在6月2日抢割登场，需要抓紧晴天进行脱粒；另外，这些小麦田大部分要栽插稻秧，在夏至前七天要完成翻土、引水和莳秧任务。因此，夏收夏种两头急，农活繁重，劳力难以安排。公社党委最初是动员各队以80％的劳力忙夏种，抽出20％的劳力忙小麦脱粒、以及少数双季早稻田的耘耥和追肥工作。任务布置下去了，可是，多数生产队并没有按照这个计划行动。公社副社长李文元同志到第三大队检查工作时，发现这个大队内各个生产小队，干部和社员白天都是忙夏种，虽然是很好的晴天，场上的小麦没有人脱粒。他发现这个问题以后，和大队党支部书记、大队长分头了解原因，才知道小队干部思想上认为，工作要段段清，忙好了夏种，再去忙小麦脱粒并不迟。他们说：“栽秧要抢时间，早一天，好一天；小麦已经割上场了，穗头子也不潮，麦堆用草芦盖得好好的，堆在那边半个月也不会坏。”有的社员说：“小麦过了夏至节令脱粒才会生麦蛾子，只要在夏至前脱粒就没有问题。”也有人说：“两条鳗鱼交叉过，只能擒住一条”。这句话的意思，是认为夏收夏种两头急，只好抓一头，两头都照顾不可能。另外，有一部分小队干部比较重视小麦脱粒工作，可是他们解决问题的方法是依靠晚上加班。三小队的队长吴家昆说：“白天莳秧，晚上脱粒是最好的方法”。
    李副社长和大队干部深入了解思想情况以后，在6日晚上就召集三大队的小队干部会议，研究夏忙期间农活“两头急”的矛盾，究竟应该怎样解决？会议一开始，李副社长提出了三种安排劳力的方法交给大家讨论。第一种方法是：“段段清”，就是做一样，清一样，先忙夏种，夏种完了再脱粒，脱粒完了再忙早稻耘耥和追肥的农活；第二种方法是“突击中心（夏种为中心）抓住两头（小麦脱粒和早稻田间管理）”；第三种方法是“夏种为中心，抽出夜晚空隙脱粒，少数早稻田耘耥、追肥向后推迟一步。这些办法提出后，引起了小队干部的热烈争论。七小队队长朱招泉说：“第一个方法好，农活‘段段清’，领导力量集中，劳动力也集中，夏种任务完成得快。”十一小队的队干部张福根说：“夏种要紧，小麦脱粒也很要紧，我不赞成
  ‘段段清’，我赞成用第三种方法，白天忙夏种，夜晚忙脱粒，两全其美。”八小队队长周阿师反对前两个人的意见，他赞成用“突击中心，抓住两头”的领导方法。他说这个方法有三个好处：（1）白天抽出少数劳力忙脱粒，对夏种影响不太大；（2）打麦工具不多，抽少数人忙脱粒，可以缓和农具紧张的情况；（3）白天脱粒可以赶太阳晒，麦子晒得脆，脱粒省工。九队队长张元夫说：“我们队里打麦床不多，逼得我用第二种方法，如果脱粒的工具多，我还是主张用第三种方法，白天一起忙莳秧，夜晚一起忙脱粒。”这时候，会场上意见不一，各说各的理由。大队干部要求大家进一步的讨论：“看哪种方法既能完成各项生产任务，又照顾到社员有足够的睡眠时间？哪种方法，更能够适应黄梅时期天气多变的情况？”八小队队长周阿师坚决地认为第二种方法好。他说：“白天莳秧，夜晚脱粒，这样做，对于夏种并不利，因为社员晚上过分疲劳，第二天工效就不高。”五小队队干部沈根生也认为夜晚脱粒不够好。他说：“夜晚脱粒，农活容易粗糙，对精收细打不利。”还有人说：“要得小麦真正的丰产丰收，脱粒是最后的一关，因此，白天必须抽人脱粒，如果等秧栽完了再脱粒，错过晴天，遇到连续阴雨，那就坏事了。”经过一番分析情况、比较利害的热烈争论，小队干部的思想认识趋于统一，大家同意用“突击中心，抓住两头”的领导方法来解决两头急的矛盾。当场，各小队干部修订小段计划。分工的方法是：正队长抓夏种，副队长抓小麦脱粒工作，每小队抽十个左右的劳力（有强有弱），在白天进行脱粒。全大队六百多人忙夏种，一百一十人忙小麦脱粒，这样估计在6月15日全大队可以完成夏种任务，16日以前完成脱粒任务。对早稻田间管理也进行了适当安排。　（梁光景）（附图片）
