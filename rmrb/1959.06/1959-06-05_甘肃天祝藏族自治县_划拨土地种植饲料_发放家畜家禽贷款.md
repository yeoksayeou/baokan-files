According to the Gansu Daily, the Party committees at all levels in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, in terms of breeding livestock and poultry, listened to the opinions of commune members, provided them with convenience and assistance in terms of feed, funds, and labor time, thereby promoting the breeding of livestock and poultry. Currently, compared with the end of 1958, the development of livestock and poultry in the county has increased as follows: pigs increased by 13.2%, chickens increased by 18.3%, ducks increased by 2.1 times, and fish increased by 12.8 times.

To resolve the contradiction between collective production and individual livestock and poultry raising in terms of time, the county proposed implementing small-scale contracted work and a system of self-reporting annual workdays. After completing the contracted quota in one day, commune members have ample time to raise pigs, chickens, and other livestock and poultry. Regarding feed, in addition to mobilizing commune members to find green grass in the season of lush vegetation to solve the problem of pig feed, it was recently stipulated that: 1. Each commune should allocate 5% of the land area per capita to commune members as fodder land for cultivating feed for livestock and poultry. 2. Using idle land and commune members' spare time, organize collective cultivation of feed, which will be distributed according to labor in the autumn for breeding livestock and poultry. 3. Production teams should distribute surplus rice bran, rice husks, bean husks, sesame husks, etc., to commune members as feed.

The pig farms of each production team and canteen have become the main bases for supplying piglets to commune members. The Heping Brigade of the Gulang Town People's Commune specially raised 560 sows for breeding piglets for collective pig farms and individual commune members. In the past two months alone, it supplied 320 piglets to commune members.

The county, communes, and production teams also provided strong economic support. So far, in addition to issuing 6,400 yuan in livestock and poultry loans to individual commune members, some communes have also provided piglets to some commune members with financial difficulties through a credit system.

As a result, the number of livestock and poultry raised by individual commune members throughout the county has greatly increased. More than 95% of commune members raise pigs, chickens, and ducks. Among them, the Heping Brigade of the Gulang Town People's Commune raises an average of four pigs and fifteen chickens per household. (Attached image)

    划拨土地种植饲料
    发放家畜家禽贷款
    据甘肃日报消息　天祝藏族自治县各级党委在繁殖家畜家禽方面，听取社员群众的意见，在饲料、资金、劳动时间等方面给予了社员以方便和帮助，从而促进了家畜家禽的繁殖。目前，全县家畜家禽的发展，与1958年年底比较：猪增加了13.2％，鸡增加了18.3％，鸭增加了二点一倍，鱼增加了十二点八倍。
    这县为了解决集体生产和个人饲养家畜家禽在时间上的矛盾，提出实行小段包工，自报全年出勤劳动日数的办法，社员在一天内完成包工定额后，有充裕的时间饲养猪、鸡等家畜家禽。在饲料方面，除发动社员在百草丛生的季节寻找青草解决猪饲料以外，最近还规定：1、各公社都按每人平均占有土地数的5％，拨给社员作为种植饲养家畜家禽的饲料地。2、利用空闲地和社员工余时间，组织集体种植饲料，秋后按劳分配，用以繁殖家畜家禽。3、各生产队将多余的谷糠、谷衣、豆衣、胡麻衣等分配给社员，当作饲料。
    各生产队和食堂的养猪场均成为供给社员仔猪的主要基地。古浪镇人民公社和平大队为集体猪场和社员个人配育仔猪，专门饲养了五百六十口母猪，仅在最近两个月内，供给了社员三百二十口仔猪。
    县、公社和生产队，还在经济上给予了大力支援。到目前为止，全县除给社员个人发放了家畜家禽贷款六千四百元外，有的公社还以赊欠办法，给一些经济上有困难的社员供给了仔猪。
    由于这样，全县社员个人饲养的家畜家禽都大有增加。95％以上的社员养了猪、鸡、鸭，其中古浪镇人民公社和平大队，平均每户养猪四口，养鸡十五只。（附图片）
