Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 1st. The Ministry of Communications recently held a national experience exchange meeting in Changsha on technological innovation and revolution in wooden sailing boat transportation. The meeting extensively exchanged advanced experiences that have emerged across the country over the past year in the technological innovation and revolution movement of wooden sailing boats. At the same time, it studied and formulated guidelines, tasks, and measures for the future development of the movement.

The meeting pointed out that since the Great Leap Forward last year, various regions have improved and created many excellent boat types based on the original wooden sailing boats. The five boat types recently improved in Hunan Province generally increased their carrying capacity by 15% to 25%. The "fish belly" boat type created in Sichuan Province increased its carrying capacity by 55% simply by adding protective cages to both sides of the wooden sailing boat. Many advanced experiences created by various provinces have transcended provincial boundaries and have been promoted in many places. The advanced experience of the "Eight Sides Wind" sailboat in Hunan Province has been widely adopted in Hubei, Jiangsu, and other places. After learning from Hunan Province's "double-wing" boat experience, Sichuan Province also developed a "four-wing" boat, successfully overcoming the difficulties of sailing boats passing through shallow滩 in the dry season. Sichuan, Hunan, and Henan have also promoted advanced experiences such as towing wooden sailing boats and hydraulic beach winches. Currently, various regions are starting to develop motorized sailing boats. In terms of port loading and unloading and the opening and repairing of航道, various regions have also done a lot of work and gained rich experience.

The meeting, after analyzing the current situation of transportation in our country, pointed out that although the transportation efficiency of wooden sailing boats has increased by about 30% compared to 1957 after last year's Great Leap Forward, the transportation capacity of wooden sailing boats is still in a backward state, and there is still great potential to be tapped. To this end, we must continue to vigorously carry out technological innovation and revolution in wooden sailing boats themselves and in related aspects such as ports and航道, so that wooden sailing boats become water transportation tools that are light in weight, heavy in load, fast in speed, low in cost, safe, and labor-saving.

The meeting determined that the guidelines for carrying out technological innovation and revolution in wooden sailing boat transportation are: under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, continue to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses. Rely on our own efforts, use local materials, and implement a combination of foreign and indigenous production methods, building new ships and improving old ships, so that ships, ports,航道, and factories are combined. Production and safety, quantity and quality are combined to gradually increase sailing speed, increase载量, accelerate ship turnover, reduce transportation costs, and meet the growing transportation needs. In order to better implement the above guidelines, the meeting believes that it is necessary to carry out the "two improvements" centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization (improving boat types, improving tools and accessories for ship use, loading and unloading, and航道 dredging), "one cleanup" (cleaning cabins to load more, mobilizing family members to go ashore), and "four -izations" (拖带化 of ship transportation, rapid loading and unloading of ports,畅通化 of tributaries and small rivers, and diversification of local materials). This will enable wooden sailing boat transportation to achieve greater leaps on the basis of past achievements.

The meeting believes that in order to lead the "two improvements, one cleanup, and four -izations" movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, it is necessary to further strengthen the political and ideological work of wooden sailing boat workers, boldly mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out socialist labor competitions, and vigorously promote advanced experiences. Further develop the water transport industry, especially the water transport industry in counties and cities and transport cooperatives that have already opened to navigation. For factories that have already been established, further rectify, consolidate, and improve them to fully utilize the potential of these factories. While carrying out the technological innovation and revolution movement of wooden sailing boats, it is necessary to strengthen transportation organization and management, strive to shorten loading and unloading time, and reduce or gradually eliminate the phenomenon of wooden sailing boats being used as warehouses. Strengthen cooperation with various relevant departments, especially with industrial, mining, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and power departments, and fully pay attention to transportation quality and safety.

The meeting requested that all relevant departments, in leading the technological innovation and revolution movement of wooden sailing boats, must be both practical and realistic, and promptly solve all problems that need to be and can be solved, so that the movement can develop healthily.

The meeting also passed a letter of倡议, calling on the workers and members on the national wooden sailing boat transportation front to strive to achieve the 1959 water transport plan. (Attached picture)

Tianmen County, Hubei Province, has realized the -ization of wooden sailing boats using foot-operated water turning boards, which can increase transportation capacity and increase sailing speed by about 40%.

    交通部组织各地交流经验革新技术挖掘潜力
    让木帆船也能多装快跑
    新华社长沙1日电　交通部最近在长沙市召开的全国木帆船运输技术革新和技术革命经验交流会议广泛地交流了全国各地木帆船一年来在技术革新和技术革命运动中出现的先进经验，同时研究和制定了今后运动发展的方针、任务和措施。
    会议指出，去年大跃进以来，各地都在原来木帆船的基础上，改良和创造了许多优良船型。湖南省最近改良的五种船型，载重量一般提高了15％到25％；四川省创造的鱼肚船型，只是在木帆船的两舷加上护笼后，载重量就提高了55％。各省创造的许多先进经验，已经超越省界在很多地方推广。湖南省帆船八面风的先进经验，已被湖北、江苏等地广泛采用；四川省学习湖南省双翼船的经验后，还发展成四翼船，成功地克服了枯水季节帆船过浅滩时的困难。四川、湖南、河南还推行了木帆船拖带、水力绞滩等先进经验。目前，各地正在着手发展机帆船。在港口装卸，开辟与整修航道方面，各地也做了很多工作，取得丰富的经验。
    会议在分析了当前我国交通运输的形势后指出，经过去年的大跃进，木帆船的运输效率虽然比1957年提高30％左右，但木帆船的运输能力仍然处在落后状态中，还有很大的潜力可以发掘。为此，在木帆船本身和港口航道等有关方面必须继续大力进行技术革新和技术革命，使木帆船成为自重轻、负载重、速度快、造价低，又安全、又省力的水上运输工具。
    会议确定了在木帆船运输中开展技术革新和技术革命的方针是：在各级党委和政府领导下，继续反对保守，破除迷信，鼓足广大群众的干劲，自力更生，就地取材，实行洋法生产和土法生产、建造新型船舶和改良旧船并举的方法，使船舶、港口、航道、工厂等环节相结合，生产和安全、数量和质量相结合，以逐步提高航速，增加载量，加速船舶周转，降低运输成本，满足日益增长的运输需要。为了更好地贯彻上述方针，会议认为必须开展以机械化半机械化为中心的两改
  （改良船型，改良船用、装卸用以及疏浚航道用的工具和属具）、一清（清舱加载、动员家属上岸）、四化（船舶运输拖带化、港口卸装快速化、支流小河畅通化、就地取材多样化）运动。使木帆船运输在过去已有的成绩上，获得更大的跃进。
    会议认为，为了领导好以机械化半机械化为中心的“两改、一清、四化”运动，必须进一步加强木帆船职工的政治思想工作，放手发动群众，大搞社会主义劳动竞赛，大力推广先进经验。进一步发展水运工业，特别是已经通航的县、市和运输社的水运工业；对已经办起来的工厂，要进一步加以整顿、巩固和提高，充分发挥这些工厂的潜力。在开展木帆船技术革新和技术革命运动的同时，必须加强运输组织工作和经营管理工作，努力缩短装卸时间，减少或逐步消灭木帆船以船代仓的现象。加强同各有关部门的协作，特别是同工矿、农林、水利、电力等部门的协作，充分注意运输质量和安全。
    会议要求各有关部门在领导木帆船技术革新和技术革命运动中，必须既务虚，又务实，及时地解决一切需要和可能解决的问题，使运动得到健康的发展。
    会议还通过了倡议书，号召全国木帆船运输战线上的职工和社员，为实现1959年水运计划而奋斗。（附图片）
