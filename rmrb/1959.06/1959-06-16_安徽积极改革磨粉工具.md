    Anhui Actively Reforms Flour Milling Tools
    (Our report) Anhui Province is actively reforming and adding wheat flour milling tools in various regions to increase work efficiency and free up a large number of laborers to invest in the main agricultural battlefront.

    Wheat will become the main food source for the masses in the coming period. Wheat processing consumes a lot of labor. If the whole province grinds flour with existing processing tools, it will require about 700,000 laborers per day, which will inevitably affect summer agricultural production.

    As of the end of May, Anhui Province has promoted more than 1,700 small steel mills and more than 31,000 various improved mills powered by foot, wind, and water. The province plans to promote 5,200 small steel mills and 200,000 various improved mills in mid-to-late June. After this plan is realized, the province will only need more than 200,000 laborers for flour milling every day, saving 500,000 laborers to invest in agricultural production.

    When reforming and adding flour milling tools, all regions adopt the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials. On the one hand, county machinery factories, farm tool factories, and qualified commune machinery factories are organized to produce small steel mills; on the other hand, communes and production teams are mobilized to reform old-fashioned mills according to actual needs. At the same time, all regions pay full attention to utilizing various power energy sources.

    Many advanced flour milling tools have been successfully created in various regions. These tools all have the characteristics of high work efficiency and saving human and animal power. The animal-powered improved mill made by Langguang County, which is pulled by animals and operated by people, can grind 800 to 1,000 jin of flour per day. The automatic windmill made by the woodworking factory of Pudong Brigade, Guozhang Commune, Binghui County, is equipped with a hoist, powder feeder, and automatic sieve. In the case of a level 4 wind, it can grind 500 to 600 jin of flour a day. When there is no wind, it can also be operated by foot. It can also draw water when not grinding flour. (Dong Zhongjing)

    安徽积极改革磨粉工具
    本报讯　安徽省各地积极改革和添制小麦磨粉工具，以提高工效，节省出大批劳力投入农业主攻战线。
    小麦在今后一段时间内，将成为群众的主要食粮。小麦加工耗费劳力很多，全省如按现有加工工具磨面粉，每天大约需要七十多万个劳力，势必影响到夏季农业生产。
    安徽省在5月底已推广小钢磨一千七百多台，脚踏、风力、水力等各式改良磨三万一千多台。全省计划在6月中、下旬将推广小钢磨五千二百台，各种改良磨二十万台。这一计划实现后，全省每天磨粉劳力只需二十多万人，可节省出五十万个劳力投入农业生产。
    各地在改革和添制磨粉工具时，都采取土洋并重，因地制宜，就地取材的原则。一方面组织县机械厂、农具厂和有条件的公社机械厂生产小钢磨；另方面发动公社和生产队根据实际需要改革旧式磨。同时各地还充分注意利用各种动力能源。
    各地已创造成功的先进磨粉工具种类很多，这些工具都具有工效高，节省人畜力的特点。郎广县制成的畜拉人磨的畜力改良磨，每天能磨粉八百至一千斤；炳辉县国章公社蒲东大队木工厂制成的自动风力磨，装有升降机，送粉器和自动筛，在四级风的情况下，一天能磨粉五百至六百斤，无风时还可用脚踏，不磨粉时还可车水。	　（董仲经）
