The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union marked the beginning of a new historical period in our country's development—the period of comprehensively building communism. The Congress not only laid the theoretical foundation for the transition of Soviet society to communism but also put forward a concrete program for establishing the material and technical foundation of communism. The control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy from 1959 to 1965, adopted by the Congress, are an extremely important and decisive component of this program.

The main task of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is to ensure a further strong upsurge in all sectors of the national economy, based on the priority development of heavy industry, and on this basis, to greatly improve the living standards of the working people.

The resolutions of the Congress vividly embody Lenin's nationalities policy and the Communist Party's concern for the comprehensive development of each republic and for strengthening the material and spiritual strength of all nationalities of the Soviet Union.

In solving the tasks put forward by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the development of all sectors of the Soviet national economy, Kazakhstan ranks as one of the top priorities in the entire Soviet Union.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and in the friendly family of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan has, in a short historical period, transformed from a backward region of Tsarist Russia into a republic with highly developed industry, mechanized agriculture, advanced science, and culture.

Kazakhstan will leap to a new and higher stage during the new Seven-Year Plan period. The republic's economy will develop at a tremendous scale, at a speed far exceeding the national average of the Soviet Union. If the total investment in capital construction increases by 80% in the entire Soviet Union from 1959 to 1965, then the total investment in capital construction in Kazakhstan will increase by 130%. The total industrial output of the Soviet Union will grow by 80% during the Seven-Year Plan period, while Kazakhstan will increase by 1.7 times. During the Seven-Year Plan period, investments in Kazakhstan's national economy will amount to 116 billion to 119 billion rubles, compared to only 52.4 billion rubles in the past seven years. This figure is much larger than the total investment in the republic's national economy during the entire Soviet era.

In Kazakhstan, as in the whole country, heavy industry is being developed with priority. The total output of the ferrous metallurgy industry will increase by 8.6 times in seven years, the mining of iron ore will increase by 5.5 times, and the mining of chromite ore will increase by 1.2 times.

With the commissioning of the Karaganda Iron and Steel Plant's blast furnace, pig iron will be produced in Kazakhstan for the first time ever. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the annual output of pig iron will reach more than three million tons. By 1965, the republic's steel output will increase sixteenfold compared to 1958, producing four million tons of coke and 3.4 million tons of steel.

During the Seven-Year Plan period, the Solovetsko-Sarbaisky Mining and Beneficiation Combine, the largest in Kazakhstan and even the entire Soviet Union, will be put into production, with a production capacity of 19 million tons of iron ore per year. It will supply iron ore raw materials to the growing steel industry in the Urals and meet the needs of Kazakhstan's metallurgical industry.

Enormous work will be carried out in expanding and building new mining and non-ferrous metallurgical industrial enterprises. In particular, a huge Pavlodar aluminum plant will be established in the bauxite ore producing area. The amount of capital construction completed in non-ferrous metallurgy will be equal to the total capital construction of the republic's entire national economy in the sixteen years before the war.

The chemical industry will be greatly developed, producing man-made fibers, mineral fertilizers, synthetic rubber, plastics, automobile tires, caustic soda, potash fertilizer, and others. Reed will be used for the production of pulp and cardboard.

During the Seven-Year Plan period, the oil and gas industry will also experience tremendous development. The extraction of oil in 1965 will increase by 30% compared to 1958, and the production of by-product gas will increase by 50%.

In the coming seven years, the republic's largest Bukhtarminsk hydroelectric station will be completed. In addition, a powerful Chardarya hydroelectric station will be built on the Syr Darya River, as well as many other large power stations. At the same time, power station reconstruction and expansion projects will be carried out. This will bring electricity production to 26 billion kilowatt-hours, or more than double the amount in 1958. It is planned to build more than 9,000 kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines to lay the foundation for connecting the various power hubs and power systems within the republic with the power systems of other republics.

With the vigorous development of industry and agriculture, more than 2,000 kilometers of new railways have been laid in the republic in recent years, and certain transformations have been carried out on existing railways. Now Kazakhstan's railways rank among the top in the Soviet Union in terms of freight volume. In the new Seven-Year Plan period, the republic's railway transport will advance greatly. For example, the average growth of national railway freight volume is 40% to 45%, while in Kazakhstan, it will grow by 220%. By 1965, the freight volume of Kazakhstan's railways alone will be 20% more than the total national railway freight volume of the Soviet Union in 1932. This achievement will be mainly due to the construction of 1,345 kilometers of new railway lines and the conversion of all railways in the republic to more advanced and efficient diesel locomotive traction, while the Karaganda-Topar section of the railway will be converted to electric locomotive traction.

The republic's machine manufacturing industry will be further developed, with the output of machine manufacturing increasing threefold in seven years. The largest steel rolling equipment factory will be established in the city of Petropavlovsk. In addition, machine-building factories, capacitor factories, cable factories, excavator factories, conveying equipment factories, and many other factories will be established.

The production of cultural and daily necessities such as washing machines, electric refrigerators, televisions, radios, and many other products will be greatly developed.

Within seven years, the republic will establish more than one hundred food industry enterprises: meatpacking plants, dairy factories, oil and fat factories, and dozens of large light industry factories. By 1965, the republic's cotton cloth production will increase by 1.7 times, woolen fabrics by 5.6 times, and leather shoes by 1.6 times.

Regarding agricultural development in Kazakhstan, the production of agricultural products will be expanded, the collective farms will be further consolidated organizationally, the technical equipment of the collective farms will be improved, and public accumulation funds, including production funds, will be increased. The role of state farms as large-scale, mechanized, and highly commercial economic units will be enhanced.

One of the main tasks of the Seven-Year Plan is to increase the productivity of agricultural labor and reduce the labor and capital consumption per unit of product by means of mechanizing and electrifying agricultural labor.

In a short period, the republic has reclaimed more than 23 million hectares of virgin land, and the sown area of various crops has reached 28 million hectares. Now Kazakhstan ranks second in the Soviet Union in terms of production and delivery of grain to the state. In the past three years, the republic has delivered more than 2 billion poods of grain to the state, which is more than the total delivered in the past 22 years.

The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that increasing grain production mainly relies on increasing yields. A series of major measures to fertilize the soil will be taken, including the widespread adoption of scientific and well-founded farmland systems and correct zoning rotation systems, as well as sowing only with carefully selected seeds suitable for the region.

Agricultural workers in Kazakhstan have put forward the task of producing at least 1.5 billion poods of grain annually.

While grain production is growing, it is decided to expand the production of technical crops: sugar beets will increase more than twofold, seed cotton will double, oilseeds will increase by 2.4 times, and so on. During the Seven-Year Plan period, Kazakhstan will become the largest livestock breeding base in the East. During this period, the republic's meat production will increase by 1.5 times, milk by 80%, and wool by 1.1 times. Livestock farming, like crop cultivation, is planned to implement regional specialization.

The feed base is of decisive significance for the successful completion of the task of increasing livestock products. Therefore, the republic plans to take major measures to expand the corn planting area to increase feed production, especially silage. At the same time, huge projects will be carried out to build the sites and sheds needed for livestock farming. Many heavy labor processes in livestock farming, such as water supply, milking, shearing, and many other labors, will be mechanized.

The tasks of the Seven-Year Plan are great, but they are also realistic and completely achievable. The republic has sufficient potential to successfully realize the tasks of the republic's Seven-Year Plan.

Now, among the workers and staff of industrial enterprises, transportation, construction sites, and among the laborers of collective farms and state farms, a socialist competition has been launched to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and they have put forward higher guarantees.

Many industrial enterprises are now overfulfilling their production tasks month by month with high quality and high output. For example, the industrial enterprises in the Guryevsk National Economic Region completed the first quarter's total output plan five days ahead of schedule, submitting surplus products worth 12 million rubles.

Certain achievements have been made in increasing livestock production and delivering livestock products to the state. The plan for delivering meat to the state in the first quarter was completed 115% before March 1, almost twice as much meat delivered as in the same period last year.

The laborers of Kazakhstan, in their socialist pledges, have made the promise to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. There is no doubt that they will successfully complete the prescribed tasks and make their due contribution to the nationwide cause of building communism in the Soviet Union.

    七年计划期间哈萨克斯坦的国民经济
    哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会书记　弗·卡利布然诺夫
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会标志着我国发展上新的历史时期——全面开展共产主义建设时期的开端。代表大会不仅奠定了苏维埃社会向共产主义过渡的理论基础，而且提出了建立共产主义物质技术基础的具体纲领。代表大会所通过的1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字是这个纲领的极为重要的决定性组成部分。
    苏联七年计划的主要任务就是，在优先发展重工业的基础上保证国民经济各部门进一步的强大高涨，并在此基础上大力提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    代表大会的决议鲜明地体现了列宁的民族政策，体现了共产党对于全面发展每一个加盟共和国，对于增强苏联各族人民物质和精神力量的关怀。
    在解决苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会提出的关于发展苏联国民经济各部门的任务中，哈萨克斯坦在全苏列为首要地位之一。
    哈萨克斯坦在共产党的领导下，在苏联各族人民友好的大家庭里，在短短的历史时期中，从过去沙皇俄国的一个落后的边区一变而成为拥有高度发展的工业、机械化农业、先进的科学和文化的共和国了。
    哈萨克斯坦将在新的七年计划期内跃上新的、更高的阶段。共和国的经济将以巨大的规模、大大超过苏联全国的速度，高速发展。如果就苏联全国而言，基本建设投资总额在1959—1965年内将增加80％；就哈萨克斯坦而言，基本建设投资总额将增加130％。全苏工业总产量在七年计划期内将增长80％，而哈萨克斯坦将增加一点七倍。七年计划期内，哈萨克斯坦国民经济的投资为一千一百六十亿到一千一百九十亿卢布，过去七年只有五百二十四亿卢布，这个数目比整个苏维埃政权年代共和国的国民经济投资总和还大得多。
    在哈萨克斯坦，也正如在全国一样，正在优先发展重工业。黑色冶金业的总产量七年内将增加八点六倍，铁矿开采量将增加五点五倍，铬铁矿开采量将增加一点二倍。
    由于卡拉干达钢铁厂高炉的开工，在哈萨克斯坦破天荒第一次生产生铁，到七年计划末，生铁的年产量将达到三百多万吨。到1965年，共和国的钢产量将比1958年增加十六倍，将生产四百万吨焦炭和三、四百万吨钢材。
    七年计划期内，全哈萨克斯坦、甚至全苏最大的索洛夫斯克—萨尔拜斯克选矿联合企业将投入生产，生产能力为每年一千九百万吨铁矿。它将以铁矿原料供应乌拉尔日益发展的钢铁工业和满足哈萨克斯坦冶金工业的需要。
    在扩建和新建采矿和有色冶金工业企业方面将要进行巨大的工作。特别是要在铝土矿产地建立起巨大的帕夫洛达尔制铝工厂。在有色冶金方面将完成的基本建设工程量，等于战前十六年内共和国的整个国民经济基本建设工程的总和。
    化学工业将获得很大的发展，将生产人造纤维、矿物肥料、合成橡胶、塑料、汽车轮胎、烧碱、钾肥和其他等。将利用芦苇进行纸浆和厚纸的生产。
    七年计划期间，石油和煤气工业也将有巨大的发展。1965年石油的开采量将比1958年增加30％，副产的煤气产量将增加50％。
    在未来的七年内，共和国最大的布赫达尔明斯克水电站将竣工，此外，还要在绥尔—达里亚河上建立一个强大的恰尔达里亚水电站和许多其他的大发电站，同时还要进行电站的改建和扩建工程。这将使电力产量达到二百六十亿度，或者说比1958年增加两倍多。计划建立九千多公里的高压输电线，以便为把共和国内各个动力枢纽站和动力系统同其他共和国动力系统联接起来打下基础。
    随着工农业的蓬勃发展，最近几年在共和国境内敷设了二千多公里新的铁路，并且对已有的铁路进行了某些改造。现在哈萨克斯坦的铁路按货运量计算在全苏居首要地位之一。新的七年计划期内，共和国的铁路运输将大大向前推进。例如，全国铁路货运量平均增长40％到45％，在哈萨克斯坦则增长220％。到1965年，仅哈萨克斯坦铁路的货运量就将比1932年苏联全国铁路货运总量还要多20％。取得这个成就主要靠新建一千三百四十五公里铁路线，并在共和国全部铁路上转换为更完善的高效能内燃机车牵引，而卡拉干达—托波尔的一段铁道将换为电气机车牵引。
    共和国的机器制造业将有进一步的发展，七年内机器制造业的产量将增加三倍。在彼特罗巴夫洛夫斯克城将建立起最大的轧钢设备工厂。此外，还要建立机器制造厂和容电器工厂、电缆工厂和挖掘机工厂、传送设备制造厂和许多其他的工厂。
    文化和日常生活用具：洗衣机、电气冰箱、电视机、收音机和其他许多产品的生产将有很大的发展。
    七年内，共和国将建立一百多个食品工业企业：肉类联合企业、牛奶工厂、油脂工厂和数十个大的轻工业工厂。到1965年，共和国的棉布生产将增加一点七倍，毛织品增加五点六倍，皮鞋增加一点六倍。
    在哈萨克斯坦的农业发展方面，将扩大农产品产量，进一步从组织上巩固集体农庄，改善集体农庄的技术设备，增加公积金，其中包括生产资金。作为大型机械化和高度商品经济单位的国营农场的作用将要提高。
    七年计划的主要任务之一就是，借助农业劳动的机械化与电气化来提高农业劳动的生产率和减少单位产品的劳动和资金消耗。
    在短短的时期内，共和国开垦了二千三百多万公顷荒地，各种农作物的播种面积达到二千八百万公顷。现在哈萨克斯坦在生产和向国家交售粮食方面跃居苏联全国第二位。最近三年内，共和国向国家交售了二十亿普特以上的粮食，比过去二十二年来交售的总和还多得多。
    七年计划规定增加粮食产量主要依靠提高收获量。将采取一系列肥沃土壤的重大措施，其中包括广泛采用科学而有根据的农田制度和正确的分区轮作制，以及只用适于本地区的精选的种籽进行播种等。
    哈萨克斯坦的农业劳动者提出每年至少生产十五亿普特粮食的任务。
    在粮食生产增长的同时，决定扩大技术作物的生产：甜菜增加两倍多，籽棉增加一倍，油料种籽增加二点四倍，等等。七年计划期内，哈萨克斯坦将变为东方最大的牲畜饲养基地。在这个期间，共和国肉类的生产将增加一点五倍，牛奶增加80％，羊毛增加一点一倍。畜牧业也如农作物栽培方面一样，计划实行地区专业化。
    饲料基地对于顺利完成增加畜牧业产品的任务具有决定性的意义。因此，共和国计划采取重大措施，扩大玉蜀黍播种面积来增加饲料，特别是青贮饲料的生产。同时还要进行巨大工程以修建畜牧业所需要的场地、棚舍。畜牧业中的许多繁重劳动过程，如供水、挤奶、剪羊毛和其他许多劳动都将机械化。
    七年计划的任务是伟大的，同时也是现实的、完全能够完成的。共和国拥有足够的潜力来顺利实现共和国七年计划的任务。
    现在，在工业企业、交通运输、建筑工地的职工中，在集体农庄和国营农场的劳动者中间，已展开了提前完成七年计划的社会主义竞赛，纷纷提出更高的保证条件。
    现在许多工业企业月月高质高产超额完成生产任务。例如，古里耶夫斯克国民经济区的工业企业提早五天完成了第一季度总产量的计划，提交了价值一千二百万卢布的超额产品。
    在增加畜牧业产量和向国家交售畜牧业产品方面已取得某些成就。第一季度向国家交售肉类的计划已在3月1日以前完成115％，比去年同时期交售的肉类几乎多两倍。
    哈萨克斯坦的劳动者在自己的社会主义保证中，提出提前完成七年计划的诺言。毫无疑问，他们一定会顺利地完成规定的任务，并为在苏联建成共产主义而斗争的全民事业中作出自己份内的贡献。
