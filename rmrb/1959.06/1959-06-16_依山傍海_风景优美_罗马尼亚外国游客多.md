Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 13th: Currently, it is the ideal travel season, and Romania, with its mountains and sea, is attracting more and more foreign tourists. This year, the number of foreign visitors traveling to Romania will double compared to last year.

Romania is a country with beautiful scenery. It has the charming Black Sea, the beautiful Carpathian Mountains, the alluring Danube Delta, and many other places of historic interest. Every year, thousands of foreign travelers come to admire the beautiful natural scenery and learn about the Romanian people's socialist construction. In various scenic areas, foreign tourists riding motorcycles and carrying shotguns often appear. At Black Sea seaside resorts and mineral spring resorts, the footprints of foreign vacationers are often left behind.

In recent years, Romania's tourism industry has become increasingly developed. Travel contracts have been signed with the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, and other countries. This year, more than 10,000 people from the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia will travel here. A group of Chinese travelers will also arrive soon.

In order to meet the needs of the majority of tourists, Romania's tourism agencies have been continuously expanding travel routes and adding well-equipped hostels in recent years. In the seaside resorts of Mamaia and Eforie on the Black Sea alone, 7,000 new hotel beds have been added from last year to the present.

    依山傍海　风景优美
    罗马尼亚外国游客多
    新华社布加勒斯特13日电  目前，正是理想的旅行季节，依山傍海的罗马尼亚吸引着越来越多的外国游客。今年，到罗马尼亚旅行的外国客人将比去年增加一倍。
    罗马尼亚是一个风景优美的国家。这里有妩媚的黑海、秀丽的喀尔巴阡山，诱人的多瑙河三角洲以及其它许多名胜古迹。每年都有成千上万的外国旅行者前来欣赏美好的自然风光和了解罗马尼亚人民的社会主义建设。在各个风光绮丽的地区，常常出现乘着摩托车的、背着猎枪的外国游客。在黑海海滨休养地、矿泉胜地，常常留下外国休养者的足迹。
    最近几年，罗马尼亚的旅行事业越来越发展了。同苏联、波兰、保加利亚、匈牙利等国都签定了旅行合同，今年，德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克都将有一万多人来这里旅行。一批中国旅行者最近也将到达。
    罗马尼亚的旅行事业机构为了满足广大游客的需要，在最近几年中不断扩大旅行路线和增修设备完善的旅社，单是在黑海边的避暑胜地马马雅和艾福利亚，从去年到现在就新增加了七千个旅馆床位。
