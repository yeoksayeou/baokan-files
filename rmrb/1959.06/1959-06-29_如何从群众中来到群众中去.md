How to Go From the Masses to the Masses
Xiao Bao

The formation of leaders' thoughts, opinions, plans, and methods, as well as the process of implementing them after they are formed, which is commonly referred to as the process of going from the masses to the masses, is essentially the process of understanding and transforming the world. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The basic tasks of the leading organs of the Communist Party are to understand the situation and grasp policies. The former is what is called understanding the world, and the latter is what is called transforming the world."

Knowledge comes from practice, that is, from the class struggle and production struggle of the broad masses. This is the basic viewpoint of Marxist epistemology. Therefore, if leaders want to form correct opinions and achieve correct leadership, they must go deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research, and they must be good at concentrating the wisdom of the masses and summarizing the experience of the masses in order to lead the masses forward. Otherwise, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his report on the revision of the Party Constitution: "Without investigation and research based on the experience and opinions of the masses, even the most talented leaders cannot conduct correct leadership."

Now, most comrades can follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee to go down and conduct investigations and research. Why can't some people still completely avoid subjectivist errors? Here, in addition to being limited by the level of understanding and analytical ability, there are roughly the following reasons:

Some comrades also go down to conduct investigations, but they cannot put down their airs and lack the "spirit of willingly being a primary school student." They do not sincerely ask the masses for advice, and therefore they do not receive sincere help from the masses. To truly achieve the purpose of investigation and research, we must follow what Comrade Mao Zedong said and have "full enthusiasm" and a "desire for knowledge." Comrade Mao Zedong once said when introducing his rural survey in Hunan that his survey targets were very broad, including intermediate responsible cadres, lower-level cadres, township-level working comrades, ordinary farmers, and even poor scholars and bankrupt heads of chambers of commerce, and small officials who managed money and grain in the county yamen and had already lost their jobs. He also pointed out: "These cadres, farmers, scholars, jailers, merchants, and money and grain clerks are my respectable and beloved teachers. I must be respectful, diligent, and take a comradely attitude when I am their student, otherwise they will ignore me, knowing but not saying, and not saying everything they know."

There are also some comrades who have "personal opinions" in their minds before going down to conduct investigations. Therefore, the purpose of the investigation is not to go to the objective reality to test whether their understanding is correct, but to intentionally and one-sidedly collect some materials that are beneficial to their "opinions." They mostly talk to grassroots cadres and activists, and mostly go to the roadside and to high-yield fields to inspect. In the process of research and analysis, they also intentionally abandon those materials that do not conform to their own opinions, and for those materials that conform to their own opinions, regardless of whether these examples and figures are true, whether there is any exaggeration, or how representative they are, they use them as the basis for making conclusions, formulating plans, and even formulating principles and policies. This kind of subjectivist investigation and research method is bound to run into snags.

Still other comrades are not good at analyzing and synthesizing the materials they have investigated and finding the essence of the problem from them. This naturally cannot achieve careful consideration and decisive action. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "They have the advantage of contacting the masses, but they are not good at thinking, and they are unwilling to use their brains to think hard. As a result, they still cannot accomplish anything." The purpose of our investigation and research is not to simply collect some figures, examples, and situations. More importantly, we should find out the laws of development of objective things and find out the basis for formulating plans and policies and the methods for correctly implementing policies. We know that Marxist epistemology is not only based on materialism (that is, knowledge comes from practice), but also applies dialectics to develop knowledge from the perceptual stage to the rational stage. The characteristic of the method by which human beings understand things is that it is not a simple photograph, but is able to go through a process of transformation and making, penetrating through the phenomenon to delve into the essence. Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago: "We must look at the essence of things and regard their phenomena only as guides to enter the door. Once we enter the door, we must grasp their essence. This is a reliable scientific method of analysis." The masses' understanding of problems often has the limitations of their position, and can often only reflect one side of things from one angle. Therefore, leaders' investigation and research must never be satisfied with the accumulation of mass opinions, but should be organized, analyzed, criticized, and generalized; according to opinions from different angles, comprehensive and correct opinions should be summed up from various aspects. In a word, it must go through the role of thinking, through the leap from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge.

Practice as the source of knowledge includes not only the practice of investigating and researching the broad masses of people, but also one's own personal practice and scientific experiments. Of course, we cannot directly experience everything, but the knowledge gained solely by listening to reports and reading materials is, after all, other people's feelings, and it is not easy to deeply understand the essence of things and truly understand them. Therefore, we must participate in the actual struggle to transform reality. Through personal practice, just as dissecting a sparrow can allow one to understand the structure of all sparrows, one can understand the general from the individual and concrete, and discover general connections and general laws. A leader can only achieve comprehensive, in-depth, and specific leadership by gaining experience in leading production from methods such as planting experimental fields and working in shifts. The leader's own scientific experiments and practice complement and improve each other with the practice of the masses. Therefore, the process of planting experimental fields and working in shifts is also the process of better learning from the masses, listening more deeply to the voices of the masses, and better concentrating the wisdom of the masses and summarizing the experience of the masses.

Investigating and researching on the one hand, and "planting experimental fields" on the other hand, in this way, we can more correctly reflect objective reality, and we can reduce and avoid subjectivism.

After the leadership's opinions are formed, and after proposals and methods are put forward, and plans, programs, and policies are formulated, we must convey our views and thoughts to others, ferment and implement them among the masses, and transform them into the actual actions of the masses. This process of "going to the masses" is a process of re-practice, and it is also a process of re-understanding that tests, enriches, improves, and develops the original opinions. This process of concentrating and then persisting is also a very complex process. If it is not done well, even correct opinions cannot be implemented, it is difficult to achieve the expected results, and it may even have the opposite effect.

Therefore, when conveying opinions to others, it is necessary to have clear viewpoints and specific materials, and to communicate with people in advance, ferment more, and discuss more, so that people have ample time to consider and digest. Otherwise, suddenly presenting finished products to others in a very short period of time, like a torrential rain in a moment, is actually not discussing issues with others, but simply "forcing signatures."

More importantly, when implementing the leadership's intentions, we must be good at listening to the different opinions of a few people. We should be decisive and make sound judgments, but at the same time, we must consult with the masses more and adhere to the principle of persuasion. We cannot assume that when we put forward a proposal and method, everyone will always agree and pass it unanimously. As the saying goes, "Ten fingers are not equally long." People's level of understanding is always uneven, so it is impossible to treat any problem with "unanimous agreement" and absolute consistency. There will always be different views on the same thing. Therefore, the degree to which the masses accept the leadership's opinions often varies, and some people may even raise opposing opinions. To this, we must admit it, face it squarely, and not worry that it will weaken unified leadership. On the contrary, "the more you poke the lamp, the brighter it becomes, and the more you debate the truth, the clearer it becomes." Only through airing views and debates can we unify everyone's understanding and make everyone feel comfortable. At the same time, dialectical materialism believes that people's understanding cannot exhaust the object, but can only approximately reflect the object. People's process of understanding is a process of gradual development and deepening from not knowing to knowing, and from not fully knowing to more fully knowing. Therefore, "it is common for people to partially change their thoughts, theories, plans, and programs in practice, and it is also common for them to change them entirely." Therefore, we cannot think that the leadership's opinions are always 100% correct and foolproof at any time. Having opposing views, listening to the different opinions of a few people, and going through repeated fermentation and debate make it easier for leaders to absorb beneficial elements from them to enrich, supplement, and improve the original opinions, making them more in line with objective reality and more perfect. It is even possible to discover and correct some original misconceptions. Therefore, if we do not pay attention to the different opinions of a few people, we will easily and dogmatically affirm those immature or even erroneous opinions and experiences, act arbitrarily, make it impossible to discover and correct errors in time, and create even greater errors. Over time, thinking will also become rigid. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong told us, "A party is like a person: it is very important to hear different voices in its ears." Even after practical testing, we have full confidence that the other party's opinion is wrong, we must also "use all effective and appropriate methods to enlighten the masses' consciousness" (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party"). Only by patiently listening to the opposing views first can we effectively carry out persuasive work by "opening a lock with a key," help those who originally held erroneous views to change their understanding sincerely and willingly, and thus consciously implement the leadership's opinions.

Implementing the leadership's opinions to the masses is a process from the general to the individual. Although the leadership's opinions come from the masses, they are abstracted from many individual and special things, so they summarize the common essence of various things; however, Marxist dialectics tells us: "Any general only roughly includes all individual things, and no individual can be completely included in the general..." (Lenin: Philosophical Notebooks, p. 369). Therefore, we cannot obliterate the particularity of concrete things. Obliterating particularity also obliterates generality. Because "the general can only exist in the individual, and can only exist through the individual" (ibid.). Commonality is contained in individuality, and general principles always appear in various special forms due to different specific times, places, and conditions. This principle tells us that when implementing the leadership's opinions to the masses, we must adhere to the principle of concrete analysis of concrete things, and dialectically unify principle and flexibility; we should allow the masses to adapt to local conditions and times, and we cannot absolutize the leadership's opinions and make rigid, mechanical, and uniform requirements. Otherwise, we will make the mistake of dogmatism and fall into the quagmire of metaphysics. The result can only be to spoil things, get out of touch with reality, get out of touch with the masses, and ultimately not jump out of the circle of subjectivism.

The working method of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses" is the concrete application and development of the materialism and dialectics of Marxism-Leninism in work, and is a high generalization and organic combination of the two in revolutionary practice. Therefore, we must deeply understand its full content from the theory of dialectical materialism and correctly apply it in practice.

    如何从群众中来到群众中去
    肖保
    领导的思想、意见、计划、办法的形成，以及形成后的贯彻执行过程，即通常所说的从群众中来到群众中去的过程，实质上就是认识世界与改造世界的过程。毛泽东同志说过：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界。”　
    认识来源于实践，也就是来源于广大群众的阶级斗争和生产斗争。这是马克思主义认识论的基本观点。因此，领导者要形成正确的意见，实现正确的领导，就必须深入到群众中去进行调查研究，必须善于集中群众的智慧，总结群众的经验，才能够领导群众前进。否则，正如邓小平同志在关于修改党章的报告中所指出的：“离开群众经验和群众意见的调查研究，那末，任何天才的领导者也不可能进行正确的领导。”
    现在多数同志都能遵循党中央的指示深入下去进行调查研究，而为什么有些人仍然不能完全避免主观主义的错误呢？这里，除了受到认识水平、分析能力的限制以外，大体上还有以下几种原因。
    有些同志虽然也下去作调查，但是却放不下架子，缺乏“甘当小学生的精神”，不是诚心诚意地向群众请教，因而也就得不到群众诚心诚意的帮助。要真正达到调查研究的目的，必须遵照毛泽东同志所说的，要有“满腔的热情”，“求知的欲望”。毛泽东同志介绍他在湖南作的农村调查时曾经说过，他调查的对象很广泛，有各县中级负责干部，下级干部，乡级工作同志，普通农民，甚至还有穷秀才，破产了的商会会长，有知县衙门管钱粮的已经失了业的小官吏。他并且指出：“这些干部、农民、秀才、狱吏、商人和钱粮师爷，就是我的可敬爱的先生，我给他们当学生是必须恭谨勤劳和采取同志态度的，否则他们就不理我，知而不言，言而不尽。”
    还有一些同志，在下去作调查以前，心中早有了“个人的主见”，因而调查的目的不是到客观实际中去检验自己的认识是否正确，而是有意地、片面地去搜集一些有利于自己“主见”的材料。他们下去多是找基层干部、积极分子谈话，多是到公路边，到丰产田去视察。在研究和分析过程中，也是有意放弃那些不符合自己的主见的材料，而对于符合自己的主见的材料，不管这些例子和数字是否真实，有没有浮夸现象，代表性如何，便以之为根据，凭以作结论，订计划，甚而制订方针政策。这种主观主义的调查研究方法，是没有不碰钉子的。
    再有一些同志，则是对调查到的材料不善于进行分析、综合，从中找出问题的本质。这自然不能作到深谋熟虑，当机立断。正如毛泽东同志所说的：“有联系群众的长处，但是不善于思索，不愿用脑筋多想苦想，结果仍然做不成事业。”我们进行调查研究的目的绝不是为了单纯搜集一些数字、实例和情况，更重要的是应当从中找出客观事物发展的规律，从中找出制订计划、政策的依据和正确执行政策的办法。我们知道，马克思主义认识论不仅立足于唯物论（即认识来源于实践），而且还应用辩证法把认识从感性阶段发展到理性阶段。人类认识事物的方法的特点就在于它不是简单的照像，而是能够经过一番改造制作的工夫，透过现象而深入到本质。毛泽东同志早就说过：“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。”群众认识问题往往有其所处的地位的局限性，往往只能是从一个角度反映事物的一个侧面。因此，领导者进行调查研究就绝不能满足于群众意见的堆积，而应该经过整理、分析、批判和概括；根据来自不同角度的意见，从各个侧面当中归纳出全面的、正确的意见。一句话，就是要经过思考作用，经过由感性认识到理性认识的飞跃。
    作为认识来源的实践，除了调查研究广大人民群众的实践外，同时也包括自己亲身的实践、科学的试验。固然，我们不可能事事直接经验，但是，单纯依靠听汇报、看材料得来的知识，毕竟是别人的感受，也就不易深刻地认识事物的本质，真正地理解它们。因此，必须参加变革现实的实际斗争。通过亲身实践，正如解剖一个麻雀就能了解一切麻雀的结构一样，才能从个别的具体事物当中，了解一般，发现一般的联系和一般的规律。一个领导人，只有从种试验田、跟班劳动等方法当中取得领导生产的经验，才能实现全面的、深入的、具体的领导。领导者自身的科学实验和实践，同群众的实践是互相补充、互相提高的。因而种试验田、跟班劳动的过程，又正是更好地向群众学习，更深入地倾听群众的呼声，更好地集中群众的智慧，总结群众经验的过程。
    一面调查研究，一面“种试验田”，这样，就能够比较正确地反映客观实际，就能够减少和避免主观主义。
    领导的意见形成以后，提出了主张和办法，制订出计划、方案、政策，就必须把自己的观点和思想传达给别人，在群众中酝酿、贯彻，变成群众的实际行动。这个“到群众中去”的过程，是再实践的过程，又是检验、丰富、提高、发展原来意见的再认识的过程。这个集中起来以后坚持下去的过程，也是一个十分复杂的过程。作得不好，即便正确的意见也不能贯彻下去，很难达到预想的结果，甚至还可能收到相反的效果。
    因此，把意见传达给别人时要观点明确，材料具体，要事先与人通气，多酝酿，多商量，使人们有充裕的考虑和消化的时间。否则，在很短的时间内突如其来地把成品摆在别人面前，如同在片刻之内下一场倾盆大雨，这实际上不是和别人商量问题，不过是“强迫签字”而已。
    更重要的是：在贯彻领导意图的时候，一定要善于倾听少数人的不同意见。应当多谋善断，同时又必须多同群众商量，坚持说服的原则。不能设想自己拿出一个主张和办法，总是全体赞成，一致通过。俗语说：“十个指头不一般齐”。人们的认识水平总是参差不齐的，因而不可能对待任何问题都是“不谋而合”，绝对一致。对同一件事情，总会有不同的看法。因此群众对于领导的意见接受的程度往往不同，甚至会有人提出反对的意见。对此，我们必须承认它，正视它，不要担心会削弱统一领导。相反，“灯愈拨愈亮，真理愈辩愈明”，只有通过鸣放、辩论，才能统一大家的认识，作到人人心情舒畅。同时，辩证唯物主义的认识论认为：人们的认识不能穷尽对象，只能近似地反映对象。人们的认识过程是一个由不知到知，由不完全知到较完全知的逐步发展、逐步深化的过程。因而人们在实践中“部分地改变思想、理论、计划、方案的事是常有的，全部地改变的事也是常有的。”所以，不能认为领导意见在任何时候都是百分之百的正确，都是万无一失的。有了对立面，听取了少数人的不同意见，经过反复酝酿、争辩，就便于领导者从中吸取有益的成分来丰富、补充、提高原来的意见，使之更符合客观实际，更臻完善。甚至也可能发觉并纠正一些原来的错误认识。所以，如果不重视少数人的不同意见，就容易使我们武断地肯定那些不成熟的、甚至是错误的意见和经验，一意孤行，使错误不能及时发觉与纠正，而造成更大的错误。久而久之，思想也会僵化起来。所以，毛泽东同志告诉我们，“一个党同一个人一样：耳边很需要听到不同的声音。”即使经过实践的检验，我们已经有充分的把握证明对方的意见是错误的，我们也必须“用一切有效的适当的方法去启发群众的自觉”（刘少奇：“论党”）。只有首先耐心地听取了反面意见，才可能针对他们的思想症结所在，“用一把钥匙开一把锁”，有效地进行说服工作，帮助那些原来持错误意见的人心悦诚服地改变自己的认识，从而自觉地贯彻执行领导意见。
    把领导意见贯彻到群众中去，是从一般到个别的过程。领导意见，虽然是从群众中来的，是从许多个别的、特殊的事物中抽象出来的，因而它概括了诸种事物的共同本质；但是，马克思主义辩证法告诉我们：“任何一般只是大致地包括一切个别事物，任何个别都不能完全地列入一般之中……”（列宁：哲学笔记，第369页）。因此不能抹煞具体事物的特殊性。抹煞了特殊性，也就抹煞了一般性。因为，“一般只能在个别中存在，只能通过个别而存在。”（同上）共性寓于个性之中，一般原则总是因为具体的时间、地点、条件不同而以各种特殊的形式出现。这个道理告诉我们：把领导意见贯彻到群众中去的时候，必须坚持具体事物具体分析的原则，把原则性与灵活性辩证地统一起来；应当允许群众因时、因地制宜，不能把领导意见绝对化，作过死的、机械的、千篇一律的要求。否则，就要犯教条主义的错误，陷入形而上学的泥坑。其结果只能把事情办坏，脱离实际，脱离群众，最终还是没有跳出主观主义的圈子。
    “从群众中来，到群众中去”这个群众路线的工作方法，是马克思列宁主义的唯物论和辩证法在工作中的具体运用和发展，是两者在革命实践中的高度概括和有机结合。因此，我们必须从辩证唯物主义的理论去深刻领会它的全部内容，并且正确地运用于实践中。
