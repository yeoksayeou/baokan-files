Xinhua News Agency Report: During the summer farming season, People's Liberation Army units across the country are actively supporting agricultural production. Under the slogan "For a bumper harvest, go wherever needed," officers and soldiers are helping farmers with the summer harvest and planting, participating in drought relief and flood prevention in rural areas, and accumulating fertilizer and rushing to produce farm tools for farmers.

　　In southern China, tens of thousands of officers and soldiers are working with farmers in the fields every day, rushing to harvest and plant. The Fujian front-line troops have already helped people's communes in various places to harvest and plant more than 22,700 mu of crops. On an island in eastern Zhejiang, just as the wheat was ripening and the commune members were going to sea to fish, a rainstorm struck. The troops stationed on the island immediately stopped training and went into action to rush the harvest, basically completing the harvesting of wheat on the entire island in two days. The logistics units stationed in Chongqing, in addition to sending a large number of officers and soldiers to help local farmers with the summer harvest and planting and transportation, also sent film projection teams to the fields to show movies and enliven the cultural life in the fields. In helping with the rush harvest and planting, the officers and soldiers of various troops strictly adhered to the principle of "careful harvesting and planting, returning every grain home." A team from a certain unit in the Wuhan area, during a period of continuous rain, also achieved "three fasts" (fast harvesting, fast transportation, fast threshing) and "four cleans" (clean cutting, clean picking, clean threshing, clean winnowing). On Sunday, May 24th, the Artillery Direct Unit of the People's Liberation Army all went to the suburbs of Beijing to help farmers water wheat, plant peanuts, and plant fruit trees. During the labor, everyone was full of energy. Although Major General Wang Yunrui was over sixty years old, he was still strong and worked very happily. The commune members of the local Huashan People's Commune praised him, saying, "It's really the old Eighth Route Army coming."

　　Recently, drought has appeared in the Hebei area, and drought relief teams organized by various troops have rushed to various places to participate in the battle against drought. A drought relief team of more than 2,500 people from a certain unit helped the people's commune dig canals, sink wells, and carry water to irrigate fields from morning to night. The officers and soldiers of a certain company worked hard for two days and built a canal that can irrigate 350 mu of wheat fields. They said: "We will not give up until we overcome the drought!" Under the slogan of "Water more, water thoroughly, and ensure a bumper harvest for the commune," the soldiers of a certain team watered more than 150 mu of wheat and dug 40,000 cubic meters of earth for canals. Recently, Nanchang has experienced continuous rain, and the water level of the Ganjiang River has continued to rise. The Jiangxi Military Region immediately established a flood control headquarters and organized troops to repair dikes and build dams to protect seedlings and production. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit were determined to "race against time with the flood and seize grain from the heavens," fighting day and night in the rain and repairing a 5,000-cubic-meter embankment in seven days.

　　The People's Liberation Army Air Force has recently been continuously dispatching aircraft to serve the great agricultural harvest. Not long ago, wheat rust appeared in Lingxi Fengxiang. A unit of the Air Force immediately dispatched aircraft to spread more than 20,000 kilograms of medicinal powder, saving more than 100,000 mu of wheat from disaster. When spring sowing in the Zhelimumeng League of Inner Mongolia encountered drought, a unit of the Air Force dispatched aircraft to help the local Mongolian people complete the sowing task on time using artificial rainfall. The Mongolian people praised: The plane enters the clouds like a flying dragon, and the dry ice is sprinkled like misty rain. Now we are not afraid of the scorching sun, and we will ensure a good harvest every year. On the Fujian front line, a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit actively responded to the call of the local party committee to "let the crops eat well, drink enough, and grow strong seedlings and big ears." In mid-to-late May, they used the gaps between combat readiness to accumulate more than 17,000 dan of fertilizer and send it to the people's commune. After returning from patrols at night, the soldiers of the coastal defense troops also picked up baskets and went to the sea with the youth fertilizer accumulation assault team of the stationed commune to collect fertilizer.

　　During the summer harvest and planting season, the auto repair shops and ordnance repair shops of various troops have taken time to make sickles and hoes for the people's communes. A certain unit stationed in Henan also dispatched a large number of vehicles to assist local commercial departments in transporting large quantities of bamboo brooms and other agricultural tools to the people's communes in the mountainous areas to support their summer harvest and planting.

    夏收夏种　抗旱防涝　赶制农具
    三军将士出动支援农业生产
    新华社讯　中国人民解放军全国各地部队在夏季农忙中，奋起支援农业生产。广大官兵在“为了农业大丰收，哪里需要到哪里去”的口号下，有的在帮助农民夏收夏种，有的在农村里参加抗旱、防涝，有的在为农民积肥、赶制农具。
    在祖国的南方，每天都有数以万计的官兵在各地田间和农民一起抢收、抢种。福建前线部队已为各地人民公社抢收、抢种二万二千七百多亩庄稼，在浙东的一个海岛上，正当小麦成熟、社员下海捕鱼时，来了暴风骤雨，驻岛部队立即停止操练，全部出动，冒风雨抢收，用两天时间把全岛的小麦基本上收割完毕。驻重庆的后勤部队，除派出大批官兵帮助当地农民夏收夏种和运输外，还出动电影放映队，到田野里放映电影，活跃田头文娱生活。在帮助抢收、抢种中，各部队官兵们严格遵守了“细收细种、颗粒还家”的原则。武汉地区部队某队在霪雨连绵的时节，还作到“三快”（快收、快运、快打）、“四净”（割净、拾净、打净、扬净）。人民解放军炮兵直属队，在5月24日星期日，全部出动到北京郊区帮助农民浇麦、种花生和栽果树等。在劳动中，个个干劲冲天。少将王云瑞虽然六十多岁了，但他老当益壮，干得很欢，当地华山人民公社社员都夸奖地说：“真是老八路来了”。
    河北一带最近出现旱象，各部队组织的抗旱队伍纷纷开赴各地，投入抗旱的大战。某部二千五百多人的抗旱大队，从早到晚帮助人民公社挖渠打井，担水浇田。某连的官兵苦战两天，修成一条可灌溉三百五十亩麦地的水渠。他们说：
  “不战胜干旱不罢休！”某队战士在“浇得多，浇得透，保证公社大丰收”的口号下，浇麦一百五十多亩，挖渠四万土方。南昌地区最近连日阴雨，赣江水位不断上涨，江西军区立即成立了防汛指挥部，组织部队修堤筑坝，保苗保产。某部官兵决心“与洪水争时间，向老天夺粮”，日夜冒雨奋战，七天修好一条五千多立方米的圩堤。
    人民解放军空军部队最近不断派飞机为农业大丰收服务。不久前，陵西凤翔一带小麦生了条锈病，空军某部当即派飞机撒放了二万多公斤药粉，使十多万亩小麦免遭灾害。在内蒙古哲里木盟春播遇旱时，空军某部派飞机用人工降雨的方法帮助当地蒙古族人民按时完成了播种任务，蒙民们赞扬道：飞机入云如飞龙，干冰撒过雨蒙蒙，如今不怕烈日旱，年年确保好收成。在福建前线，某高射炮部队积极响应驻地党委“让庄稼吃好、喝饱、苗壮穗大”的号召，在5月中下旬利用战备间隙，积肥一万七千多担送往人民公社。海防部队的战士夜间巡逻归来后，还拿起筐篓和驻地公社青年积肥突击队一起下海捞肥。
    各部队的汽车修理厂、修械所在夏收夏种期间都抽出时间，为人民公社打镰刀、制锄头等。驻河南某部还派出大批汽车，协助地方商业部门把大批竹扫帚和其它农具运往山区的人民公社，支援他们夏收夏种。（附图片）
