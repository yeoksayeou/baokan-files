    ——A Story of the People's Liberation Army Rescuing a Pregnant Woman from the Flood
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 26th: On the evening of June 15th, when the flood rushed towards the Xialang Management Area of the Huihuan People's Commune in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, the family of commune member Liu Rong was in a state of extreme emergency. His daughter-in-law, Tang Xi, was about to give birth, and his son, Liu Shifa, was at the steel mill and unable to return. His old wife, holding her three-year-old grandson, stared blankly at the rising floodwater entering the house, listening to her daughter-in-law's faint moans, and anxiously said, "What to do? If she doesn't give birth in the second half of the night, she'll definitely give birth tomorrow morning. The water is rising relentlessly, and there's no midwife..."
    Suddenly, the sound of oars faintly came. A red light floated towards them. "A boat! A boat is coming!" Liu Rong's old wife couldn't help but shout.
    The boat went straight to the door. Women's representative Zhuang Tangzhi and two People's Liberation Army comrades jumped off the boat. Zhuang Tangzhi said, "The branch secretary knows that Tang Xi is about to give birth, and asked me to bring PLA comrades to your house. The PLA has been rescuing the people all day without rest. Quickly pack up your things and let's go!"
    They carefully helped the pregnant woman onto a stretcher and carried her onto the boat. It was still raining. The PLA comrades took off their raincoats and covered the pregnant woman. The boat headed towards the PLA garrison on the small hill. Liu Rong's family was out of danger.
    At dawn, the people who had been busy all night had just rested when the old woman suddenly ran to the regiment's associate, saying that her daughter-in-law was in great pain. The associate quickly called several medical staff to the dormitory where the pregnant woman was staying. At this time, the pregnant woman was holding her belly and breathing heavily. Soon after, a chubby boy was born.
    Nurse Xiao Yuan, holding the child, told the child's mother: the child weighed a full seven pounds. The child's mother cried with tears of gratitude.
    At this moment, Liu Rong and Zhuang Tangzhi pushed the door open and came in, followed by several officers' family members, each holding colorful baby clothes. Zhuang Tangzhi said with a smile, "Look, they've come to bring gifts for the child."
    Just as they were speaking, the nurse and two cooks brought porridge and white sugar, telling the mother to eat. Liu Rong took the bowl, his hands trembling with excitement. Before he could find a word of thanks, several PLA leaders came to visit. They brought the mother brown sugar and biscuits, asking if she had any difficulties in her life and what else she needed.
    Looking at these kind and amiable faces, Liu Rong was too moved to speak. He grabbed a general's hand, wanting to say something, but he didn't, only wiping away tears with his sleeve. He asked the general, "Thanks to the blessings of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, please give my child a name, so that he will never forget the kindness of the People's Liberation Army!"
    The general thought for a moment and said, "The child was born in the army, and we all like him so much. Let's call him Junsheng (Army Born)! How about that?"
    Liu Rong nodded repeatedly, and his daughter-in-law gently and affectionately called the child's name: "Junsheng!"

    军生
    ——记解放军在洪水中抢救孕妇
    6月15日傍晚，当洪水冲向广东惠阳县惠环人民公社夏廊管理区的时候，社员刘榕家里正处在万分紧急的情况下，他的儿媳妇汤锡快要临产，儿子刘石发又在炼钢厂，不能回来。他的老伴抱着三岁的大孙子，呆呆地望着涨进门来的大水，听着儿媳妇低微的呻吟声，着急地说：“这怎么办呢？后半夜不生，明早一定生，水不住劲的涨，又没有接生员……。”
    忽然，隐隐地传来一阵桨声。一盏红灯，迎面飘来。“船！船来了！”刘榕的老伴禁不住高声地喊了起来。
    船一直划到门口。妇女代表庄塘忮和两个解放军同志一起从船上跳下来。庄塘忮说：“支书知道汤锡临产了，叫我带解放军同志到你家来，解放军为了抢救老百姓，整天都没有休息，现在快收拾收拾东西走吧！”
    他们小心翼翼地把孕妇扶上担架，抬上船去。这时，雨还在下着。解放军同志脱下雨衣，盖在孕妇的身上。船向小山头的解放军驻地驶去。刘榕一家离开险境了。
    天蒙蒙亮，忙了一夜的人们刚刚休息，老太婆突然跑来找部队的协理员，说她儿媳妇腹痛得很厉害。协理员连忙叫几个医护人员，一同奔向孕妇住的宿舍。这时，孕妇正抱着肚子，粗粗地喘息，不一会，一个胖胖的男孩出生了。
    护士小袁抱着小孩告诉孩子的妈妈：孩子足足七斤重。孩子的母亲含着感激的泪花哭了。
    这时候，刘榕和庄塘忮推门进来，后面还跟着好几个军官家属，她们手里都拿着鲜艳的小孩花衣服。庄塘忮笑嘻嘻地说：“看，她们给孩子送东西来了。”
    正说着，护士和两个炊事员端来了稀饭和白糖，叫产妇吃。刘榕接过碗来，一双手激动的直抖，他还没来得及找句话来感谢，几个解放军首长又来探望了。他们给产妇送来了红糖、饼干，问她们生活还有什么困难，还需要什么东西。
    刘榕看着这一张张和蔼可亲的面孔，激动得说不出话来。他一把拉住一位将军的手，想说什么，但又没有说，只用衫袖擦起泪来。他要求将军：“托共产党和毛主席的福，你给我孩子起个名吧，叫他一辈子也不忘解放军的恩情！”
    将军略微思考了一下说：“小孩在军队里生，我们大家都这样喜欢他，就叫军生吧！好不好？”
    刘榕连连点头，儿媳妇轻轻而又充满感情地叫了孩子一声：“军生！”
