Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 20th - News received here this evening states that another armed uprising has broken out near Punta Miamo on the north coast of the Dominican Republic. Thanks to the support of the people, this anti-dictatorial armed force launched a pincer attack, quickly cutting off the highway linking Puerto Plata and Gaspar Hernandez, thereby isolating the area.

The news said that dictator Trujillo's aircraft have been constantly bombing the Constanza area, which is occupied by another rebel army, in recent days, but the rebel forces have suffered little damage.

    多米尼加续有武装起义
    新华社哈瓦那20日电　这里傍晚时分得到的消息说，多米尼加北海岸朋塔·米亚莫地方附近又爆发了一次武装起义。由于得到人民的支持，这一支反独裁武装队伍发动了一个钳形攻势，迅速切断了联结布拉塔港和加斯帕·埃尔南德斯的公路，从而使这个地区陷于孤立。
    消息说，独裁者特鲁希略的飞机近日来曾不断轰炸为另一股起义军所占领的康斯坦萨地区，但是起义部队没有受到什么损失。
