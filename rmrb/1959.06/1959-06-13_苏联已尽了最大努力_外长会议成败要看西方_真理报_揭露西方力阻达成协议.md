Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 12th:  "Pravda" on the 12th, citing a series of facts, exposed the obstructionist attitude of Western countries at the Geneva Conference and pointed out that the West is trying its best to create public opinion for the possible failure of the conference, while attempting to shift the responsibility onto the Soviet Union.

"Pravda" said that the first fact is that the Soviet delegation has already submitted a draft peace treaty with Germany at the conference, and in order to cater to the wishes of the West, it later made certain supplements to this draft treaty. However, the Western representatives did not put forward anything specific on this fundamental issue. They simply put the issue aside and speculated on the issue of German reunification, while setting up a lot of obstacles on the road to genuine German reunification.

The second fact: The Soviet representative tried his best to get the negotiations out of the deadlock and put forward suggestions on the road to rapprochement between the two Germanys, advocating the establishment of an all-German committee for this purpose (the West's so-called "package plan" also put forward this proposal). But at this time, the West avoided this issue. They immediately expressed no interest in this issue.

The third fact: When the conference began to discuss the normalization of the situation in West Berlin, the Soviet side did everything possible to make the solution of this problem take into account the interests of all major countries, including Western countries, and therefore put forward the proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, but at this time the Western representatives did everything possible to prevent an agreement from being reached. They insisted on maintaining the occupation system in West Berlin.

The fourth fact is that on June 10, the Soviet delegation once again tried to push the conference forward. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko said at the formal meeting that the Soviet side, taking into account the attitude of Western countries, was prepared to agree to temporarily retain certain occupation rights of Western countries in West Berlin. During this period (for a period of one year), the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany could establish an all-German committee or seek other forms of cooperation acceptable to both Germanys to discuss expanding mutual contact, formulating measures for a unified Germany, and preparing to conclude a peace treaty. This new Soviet proposal took a big step to cater to Western countries. However, the facts show that Western countries used this proposal as an excuse to worsen the atmosphere of the negotiations.

The fifth fact is that while the Soviet delegation expressed a full understanding of the position of Western countries and took into account a series of Western countries' considerations on the issue of the peace treaty and on the issue of West Berlin in the negotiation process, the representatives of Western countries did not do so at all. The ministers of the United States, Britain, and France always answered "no" to all the Soviet proposals. They adopted this attitude towards the new Soviet proposals, groundlessly saying that these proposals were exerting "pressure" on them.

"Pravda" pointed out that, in addition, some Western ministers have recently resumed the clumsy tactics of the "Cold War," rudely and stubbornly attacking the German Democratic Republic and its social system.

"Pravda" emphasized, when talking about the future situation of the conference, that it is not too late to strive for positive results on the issues discussed, even if only on some of them. The new Soviet proposal was put forward precisely for this purpose. Now, whether the outcome of the conference will ease or aggravate the international situation depends entirely on what attitude the Western foreign ministers take.

### 苏联已尽了最大努力  外长会议成败要看西方  “真理报”揭露西方力阻达成协议

    苏联已尽了最大努力
    外长会议成败要看西方
    “真理报”揭露西方力阻达成协议
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”12日援引一系列事实，揭露西方国家在日内瓦会议上的阻挠态度，并指出西方正竭力为会议的可能失败制造舆论，同时企图把责任推到苏联身上。
      “真理报”说，第一个事实是：苏联代表团已在会议上提出了对德和约草案，并且为了迎合西方的愿望，后来又对这个和约草案提出了某些补充。但是西方代表却丝毫没有就这个根本问题提出具体的东西。他们只是把这个问题搁置一旁，拿德国统一问题进行投机，同时又在走向德国真正统一的道路上设置一大堆障碍。
    第二个事实：苏联代表竭力使谈判摆脱僵局，提出关于两个德国接近的道路的建议，主张为此建立全德委员会（西方的所谓“一揽子计划”中也提出这个主张）。但是在这时候，西方却回避这个问题。它们对这问题马上表示不感兴趣。
    第三个事实：当会议开始讨论使西柏林局势正常化的问题时，苏联方面尽一切可能使这个问题的解决能够考虑到各大国，其中包括西方国家的利益，因而提出了关于把西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市的主张，可是这时西方代表却尽一切可能来阻止达成协议。它们坚持要保持西柏林的占领制度。
    第四个事实是：6月10日苏联代表团曾经再次尝试把会议推进一步。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在正式会议上说，苏联方面考虑到西方国家的态度，准备同意暂时保留西方国家在西柏林的某些占领权。在这期间内（为期一年），德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国可以建立一个全德委员会或者寻求两个德国都能接受的其他合作方式来讨论扩大互相接触、制定统一德国的措施以及准备缔结和约的问题。苏联这个新建议迈出了一大步来迎合西方国家。但是，事实表明，西方国家却用这个建议来作借口，恶化谈判的气氛。
    第五个事实是：在苏联代表团对西方国家的立场表示完全了解，并且在谈判过程中考虑了西方国家在和约问题上和在西柏林问题上的一系列考虑时，西方国家的代表们却丝毫没有这样做。美国、英国和法国的部长们对苏联的所有建议的回答总是“不”字。它们对苏联的新建议也是采取这种态度，毫无根据地说什么这些建议是对它们施加“压力”。
    “真理报”指出，此外，西方某些部长最近又恢复了“冷战”的拙劣手法，粗暴和顽固地攻击德意志民主共和国和它的社会制度。
    “真理报”谈到会议今后的情况时着重指出，争取对所讨论的问题，那怕是就其中一部分问题取得积极的结果，目前为时还不算迟。苏联的新建议正是为此而提出的，现在，会议的结果，国际局势是缓和还是加剧，完全要看西方外长们采取什么态度了。
