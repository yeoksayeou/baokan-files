A Good Experience

　　The small-scale scientific report seminar that the Mathematics Department of Fudan University has adhered to for more than 20 years can promote scientific research and cultivate young teachers. It is a good teaching experience.

　　The Party organization of Fudan University attached importance to this experience accumulated over many years and summarized and improved it, promoting it in various science departments, which improved the quality of teaching. An important lesson was learned from this: to improve the quality of teaching, we must value and use the good experiences accumulated by teachers through years of hard work. If it is thought that new teaching experience should be created by departing from the past foundation, without analysis, and regarding everything from the past as bad, or not giving it due attention, then that is inappropriate.

　　It is hoped that Fudan University’s practice of valuing past teaching experience can be valued by all schools, and that they will also pay attention to sorting out past useful teaching experiences.

    一条好经验
    复旦大学数学系坚持了二十多年的小型科学报告讨论会，可以推动科学研究，培养青年教师，是一条好的教学经验。
    复旦大学党组织重视了这条多年积累起来的经验，并加以总结提高，在理科各系中推广，提高了教学质量。从这里，得到了一条重要经验，那就是要提高教学质量，必须重视和运用过去教师多年辛勤劳动积累起来的好经验。如果认为要创造新的教学经验，就离开了过去的基础，不加分析，把过去的东西都认为是不好的，或者不予以应有的重视，那是不妥当的。
    希望复旦大学的这条重视过去教学经验的做法，能够受到各学校的重视，同样注意整理过去的有用的教学经验。
