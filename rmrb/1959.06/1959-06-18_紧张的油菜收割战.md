Tense Rapeseed Harvesting Battle
By our reporters Wang Hongxian and Xu Shoukeng

	In early June, the endless fields of rapeseed in the Yangjing Commune's Jinqiao Brigade, on the outskirts of Shanghai, gradually turned yellow; the dense layers of seedpods rustled melodiously in the wind. The harvest season had arrived!

	Before the harvest began, everyone eagerly sharpened their sickles, cleared the fields, and tidied the warehouses. The young men inquired about the start date several times a day. When the order to begin was given, people plunged into a tense harvest battle amid cheers.

	Who is First?

	At three o'clock in the morning on the first day of the harvest, the silent village was awakened by the sound of footsteps as people, guided by the faint starlight, rushed to the rapeseed fields. They decided to harvest before the morning dew dried each day to prevent the rapeseed pods from splitting and losing seeds.

	Old farmer Gong Chunlai was so excited that he could hardly sleep that night. He got up just after 2:30 AM. However, the impatient young man Yao Yueshui arrived at the field before him. At this time, the fields were empty, but a large patch of rapeseed had already been harvested by the brigade. Who had done it?

	The previous morning, kitchen staff members Gu Yuexin and Min Cuiying secretly discussed in the kitchen: "The commune's rapeseed is growing so well; we must not miss the opportunity to participate in the harvest." At eight o'clock that evening, they washed the dishes and pots, grabbed their prepared sickles, and hurried to the rapeseed fields. After production team leader Zhang Lingfeng discovered their secret, she repeatedly tried to dissuade them, but couldn't help but follow them. They originally planned to harvest for a short while and then return, but as they harvested the thick and heavy rapeseed, they became more and more enthusiastic. As a result, they didn't leave until 2:00 AM, just before it was time to prepare breakfast in the cafeteria, and then they left reluctantly.

	Secret Competition, Not Overt

	Without the brigade's arrangement or anyone's supervision, intense challenges and responses unfolded between groups and individuals during the harvest. In the rapeseed fields, all that could be heard was the rapid "snip, snip" sound.

	Young man Ma Yuebin, on behalf of his group, challenged Jiang Longbao's group. The majority of Jiang Longbao's group members were women, and it seemed they were no match for the strong Ma Yuebin's group. Therefore, she did not accept the challenge face-to-face. However, as soon as she returned to the group, she convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. After some discussion, everyone was eager to try and decided to have a "secret competition, not an overt one." The group arranged who would harvest and who would clip the pods according to their labor strength, and they also decided to start work half an hour earlier each day.

	The competition continued secretly like this. They didn't win on the first day, caught up a big step on the second day, and overtook them on the third day. Every day, young man Ma Yuebin saw Jiang Longbao and her group members running to the work recorder after work to ask questions, knowing they were checking the progress of his group's harvest. One day, he couldn't hold back any longer and went to ask Jiang Longbao:

	"Are you having a secret competition with us?" At this moment, the members of Jiang Longbao's group burst into triumphant laughter.

	Racing Against the Plum Rain Season

	Li Ashun and his team only threshed eight mu of rapeseed in one day. This was because they lacked experience as it was their first time planting rapeseed. They were threshing by rubbing the pods with their hands, which made their palms sore and the progress slow. The old farmer, who came from a poor background, became more and more anxious: at this rate, it would take a month to complete the threshing of the team's rapeseed. In a few days, the plum rain season in Jiangnan would arrive. What should they do?

	That day, after work, Li Ashun squatted by the field and discussed this difficult matter with other commune members. With many people, there were many ideas. You said one thing, and another said something else. The conclusion was that they must find threshing tools. Then everyone went home to find tools. Some people brought out ladders to hold the rapeseed stalks and beat them on the rungs for threshing; some found carrying poles, shoulder poles, forked sticks, and broom handles. The women even brought out their wedding dowry—the lacquered, bright red rattan beaters—to use as threshing tools.

	The threshed rapeseed also needed tools to lay on for sun-drying. That evening, Li Ashun took out his clean white sheets and bed mats, and other commune members followed suit, taking out their burlap bags and blankets. The next day, a spectacular array of threshing and sun-drying tools appeared on the village threshing ground. People were contributing all their strength to compete with the rainy season for a bumper harvest.

	Like Treating a Lover

	The Pudong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party established a harvesting command center. The command center was located in the village.

	Every night, after the commune members were asleep, the command center was still brightly lit. The commanders participated in harvesting and inspection during the day and then gathered together to intensively plan the next day's battle.

	This year, the brigade's rapeseed grew like a dense shrub forest, with plants and pods intertwined. A little carelessness or excessive force during harvesting could cause the loss of pods and seeds. Before the harvest began, County Party Secretary Zhao personally harvested a patch of rapeseed and then convened brigade and production team cadres that evening to summarize experience. He humorously summarized it, saying, "Harvesting requires patience and care, like a young man treating his lover." Then, the command center's phone rang, and the team leaders used the telephone lines to transmit the summarized operating methods to their troops.

	Deputy County Head Zhang also spent his days running around the rapeseed fields. One day, he inspected a pile of rapeseed husks in a production team that had been threshed twice and was about to be discarded as firewood. He discovered that there were still a few rapeseed seeds on them. He organized manpower to thresh them again, yielding an additional 19.2 jin of rapeseed per mu. The command center held an on-site meeting of "returning every grain to the household" that day.

	The commanders relentlessly and promptly directed the harvest battle in this way.

	Selling Good Grain to the State

	These days, the purchasing station has been busy from morning to night. Commune members are pushing carts, rowing boats, carrying and shouldering loads, constantly delivering the freshly winnowed rapeseed to the station.

	Early June in Shanghai is rainy. That day, after several hours of heavy rain had just subsided, and drizzle still hung in the air, the purchasing agents settled the day's accounts and prepared to rest for a while. However, the rumbling sound of carts returned. Min Daimei and Min Feng'e, one pushing and one pulling, delivered a cart full of rapeseed to the purchasing station. The bottom of the cart was padded with thick rice straw, and the top was covered with a raincoat, but they themselves were not wearing anything to protect them from the rain. The purchasing agent greeted them with a smile while taking samples for inspection. The results: every hundred jin contained fourteen liang of impurities (the national purchasing standard is four jin), and every hundred jin contained eight jin of moisture (the national standard is nine jin), proving that the rapeseed they delivered was of the highest quality.

	Inspector Ma Yongshang, who has more than forty years of experience, now says to everyone: this year's rapeseed has large, full grains, few impurities, and low moisture content, which he has rarely seen in the past.

    紧张的油菜收割战
    本报记者　王洪仙　徐寿铿
    6月初旬，上海市郊洋泾公社金桥大队连绵五、六里的油菜，渐渐黄熟；密密层层的菜荚，随风传出动听的“沙沙”的声响。收获的季节到来了！
    开镰前夕，人人争磨镰刀，腾场地，整理仓库，小伙子们一天数次探询开割的日期。当开镰的号令一响，人们就在欢腾中卷入了一场紧张的收获的战斗。
      谁是第一个
    开镰第一天凌晨三点钟，寂静的村庄响起杂踏的脚步声，人们借着稀微的星光，奔向菜地。他们决定每天在夜露未干前收割，免得油菜裂荚落粒。
    老农龚春来，这天晚上兴奋得怎么也难以入睡，两点半钟刚过，他就披衣起身了。可是，性急的小伙子姚月水，却抢在他之前赶到了菜地。这时候田野空无一人，但大队的油菜早已割掉了一大片。这究竟是谁割的呢？
    前一天的早晨，食堂炊事员顾月新和闵翠英暗暗在厨房里商量：“社里油菜长得这样好，我们一定不能错过参加收割的机会。”这天晚上八点钟，她们洗净了碗筷瓢锅，拿起早已准备的镰刀，急匆匆赶到油菜地去。生产队长张玲凤发现她们的秘密后，一面连声劝阻，一面却情不自禁地也跟着去了。她们三人原是打算稍割一会就回来的，但割着又粗又沉的油菜，越割越起劲，结果一直割到黎明前二点钟，食堂该烧早饭的时候，她们才恋恋不舍地离开了。
      暗比明不比
    不需要大队的布置，也不需要谁的督促，收割时，小组与小组、个人与个人之间展开了热烈的挑战应战。菜田里，听到的只是一片急骤的“嚓嚓”声。
    小伙子马岳彬代表他们小组向姜龙宝小组挑了战。姜龙宝小组的组员妇女居多数，看来不是人强马壮的马岳彬小组的对手，她因此当面没有应战。可是，一回到组内，就召开紧急会议，商量对策。大家经过一番讨论，人人磨拳擦掌，决定和对方来一个“暗比明不比”。小组按劳动力强弱，谁收割，谁剪荚，安排得停停当当，并且还决定每天提早半小时上工。
    竞赛就这样暗暗地持续下去，第一天没有胜过，第二天赶上一大步，第三天就赶过了。小伙子马岳彬每天看到姜龙宝他们一下工就跑到记工员面前问这问那，知道是在查问他的小组的收割进度。这一天，他憋不住了，跑去问姜龙宝：
  “你们和我们是暗比明不比吧？”这时，姜龙宝小组的组员们发出了一阵胜利的笑声。
      同霉雨争先
    李阿顺他们小队一天只脱了八亩地的菜籽。这是因为第一次种油菜，缺乏经验。他们是用手搓着脱粒的，手心搓痛，进度又慢。这个贫农出身的老农民越想越焦急：按这样的进度，小队的油菜完成脱粒要一个月的时间。再过几天，江南的霉雨季节就要到来，这该怎么办呢？
    这天一下工，李阿顺就蹲在田边和其他社员商量这件难事。人多主意多，你一言我一语，得出的结论是：一定得找脱粒的工具。接着就人人回家找工具去了。有的人搬出扶梯，以便捏着菜秆在上面摔打脱粒；有些人找出扁担、扛棒、桠杈棍、扫帚柄；妇女们连结婚的嫁妆——漆得红艳艳的藤编的被拍，也拿出来当作脱粒的用具。
    脱了粒的油菜，又需要工具垫着曝晒。李阿顺当天晚上把自己洁白的被单、床上的席子拿了出来，其他社员也跟着拿出自己的麻袋布、毯子。次日，村庄的脱粒场上，就出现了洋洋大观的脱粒和曝晒的工具。人们为了和雨季争夺丰收的果实，贡献出自己的全部力量。
    像对待爱人那样
    中共浦东县委成立了收割指挥部。指挥部就设在村镇上。
    每天深夜，当社员们已经熟睡，指挥部依然灯火通明。指挥员们白天参加收割和检查，这时又聚集在一起，在紧张地部署次日的战斗。
    今年大队的油菜长得像茂密的灌木丛林，株与株，荚与荚交错纠缠在一起，收割时稍不经心或者用力过猛，就会造成落荚、脱粒的损失。县委赵书记在开镰前特地亲自收割一片油菜，当晚就召集大队和生产队干部总结经验。他饶有风趣地归纳说：“收割时要耐心、体贴，就像青年人对待自己的爱人那样。”接着，指挥部的电话就响了，队长们通过一根根电话线，把总结出的操作方法传到自己的部队。
    这些日子，张副县长也整天在菜田里奔波忙碌。一天，他在一个生产队检查经过两次脱粒、准备送出当柴烧的菜箕，发现上面还有少数菜籽。他组织人力又脱了一次粒，每亩多打了十九斤二两菜籽。指挥部当天就举行了“颗粒还家”的现场会议。
    指挥员们就是这样不懈地、及时地指挥着收获的战斗。
    把好粮卖给国家
    这些日子，收购站从早到晚忙个不停。社员们推着车，划着船，也有挑的、扛的，把刚扬净的菜籽不断地送到这里。
    6月初的上海是多雨的。这一天连续几小时的暴雨刚刚收敛，天空依然飘着雨丝，收购员们算清了积下的账目，准备稍歇一会。可是，辘辘的车声又传来了。闵大妹和闵凤娥一个推一个拉，把满满一车的菜籽送到收购站。车底垫着厚厚的稻草，顶上盖着雨衣，她们自己身上却什么也不披盖。收购员一面笑脸相迎，一面取样检验。结果：每百斤含杂质十四两（国家收购标准是四斤），每百斤含水分八斤（国家标准是九斤），证明她们送来的菜籽是上等的。
    有四十多年经验的检验员马咏裳，现在逢人就说：今年的菜籽粒壮、籽满、杂质少、水分轻，过去很少见到过。
