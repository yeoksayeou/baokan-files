Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 24th. The National Planning Commission, the National Economic Commission, and the Ministry of Finance recently jointly convened a national experience exchange meeting on cost management for industrial and transportation enterprises in Chengdu. The meeting focused on exchanging experiences of enterprises strengthening cost management work under the leadership of the Party committee and relying on the masses of workers and staff. It also discussed how to further boost morale and do a good job in enterprise cost work centered on the increased production and thrift movement.

Participating in this meeting were representatives from central industrial and transportation departments, planning commissions and relevant departments (bureaus) of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as some factories and mining enterprises.

The meeting emphasized that financial cost personnel should, on the basis of the achievements gained in 1958, further strive to do a good job in cost work. Especially in the increased production and thrift movement, they should closely center on the central work of the Party, and according to different periods and different situations, serve as assistants to the enterprise Party committee and give play to the positive role of cost work. According to the experiences exchanged at the meeting, cost work should play the role of finding avenues, proposing measures, calculating effects, comparing achievements, and boosting morale in the increased production and thrift movement. That is to say, through cost planning, put forward fighting goals; through cost accounting work, calculate the economic effect of increased production and thrift, so that the leadership has a clear understanding and provides data for the masses to carry out evaluation and competition; through cost analysis and comparison, discover advanced links, summarize advanced experiences, find avenues for increased production and thrift, and propose specific measures.

The meeting believed that enterprise cost work should continue to implement the mass line working method on the basis of strengthening centralized leadership and strengthening departmental work. In the discussion, the representatives unanimously believed that implementing the mass line must firmly grasp the solution of the following issues: (1) In enterprise cost management, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of combining unified leadership with the division of management between the factory department and the workshop. Unified leadership means that the enterprise is the unit, unified planning, unified quota, unified system, and unified accounting of profits and losses. (2) The principle of combining centralized leadership with decentralized management must have appropriate forms. For example, the graded accounting form currently implemented by many enterprises is a form of unified accounting and attracting the masses to participate in appropriate parts of cost management and cost accounting. Because labor time, raw materials, fuel, and tool consumption are directly handled and controlled by workers, workers participating in management, and everyone caring about costs, can produce more and better products with the least amount of manpower and materials. (3) Factories and mining enterprises must attach importance to and strengthen cost planning work. It should be recognized that cost planning is an important lever for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. Doing a good job in cost planning can promptly put forward advanced and practical indicators and measures, and can inspire the morale of the masses. (4) Strengthen collaboration and cooperation. Departments, workshops, and teams must cooperate closely, establish an overall thinking, and promote the spirit of communist cooperation. (5) In mobilizing the masses to strengthen cost work, it is necessary to grasp the policy boundaries. It is necessary to vigorously save raw materials and man-hour consumption, and also ensure the quality of products; it is necessary to improve equipment utilization, and also pay attention to the normal maintenance and repair of equipment; it is necessary to care about production, and also care about the lives and safety of workers; it is necessary to pay attention to the interests of cost units, and also consider the overall interests of other departments and the national economy; it is necessary to pay attention to immediate interests, and also consider long-term interests. Only by handling affairs in accordance with policies can the goal of more, faster, better, and more economical be achieved. The meeting also believed that to strengthen cost work, it is necessary to strengthen the cost management and accounting work of the functional departments of enterprises and workshops, and not push those things that should be done by the functional departments to the masses. Do not think that with the participation of the masses, the cost management and accounting work can be dispensed with or weakened by the management of the enterprise functional departments. That kind of view that opposes the management of functional departments to the participation of the masses in management is incorrect.

The meeting also particularly emphasized that to strengthen the cost work of enterprises, it is necessary to improve the necessary rules and regulations. The role of rules and regulations is to guide people to act in accordance with certain norms, which is necessary for conducting production activities in an orderly manner, and also necessary for conducting financial cost work in an orderly manner.

When rectifying and improving rules and regulations, it is necessary to analyze according to the specific situation, and those that should be established must be established immediately, and old ones that are broken must be replaced with new ones. Before the necessary systems are established, the old ones can also be used temporarily, and the old ones can be broken after the new ones are established. This year, we should gradually rectify and improve cost plan management, cost accounting methods, cost expenditure scope, fund management, and financial expenditure rules and regulations.

    国家计委等单位召开成本管理工作会议
    抓住成本核算推动增产节约
    经验证明：成本工作在增产节约运动中起着找门路、提措施、算效果、比成绩、鼓干劲的作用。
    新华社成都24日电　国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会和财政部最近在成都联合召开全国工业、交通企业成本工作经验交流会议。会议着重交流了企业在党委的领导下，依靠职工群众加强成本管理工作的经验，并且讨论了如何进一步鼓足干劲，围绕增产节约运动作好企业成本工作的问题。
    参加这次会议的，有中央工业、交通运输各部门，各省、市、自治区计划委员会和有关厅（局），以及一部分厂矿企业的代表。
    会议强调指出，财务成本工作人员应当在1958年获得的成绩的基础上，进一步努力作好成本工作，特别是在增产节约运动中，要紧紧围绕党的中心工作，根据不同时期和不同情况，作好企业党委的助手，发挥成本工作的积极的作用。根据会上交流的经验，成本工作应当在增产节约运动中起找门路、提措施、算效果、比成绩、鼓干劲的作用。这就是说，通过成本计划，提出奋斗目标；通过成本的核算工作，计算增产节约的经济效果，使领导上心中有数，为群众开展评比竞赛提供资料；通过成本的分析比较，发现先进的环节，总结先进的经验，寻找增产节约的门路，提出具体的措施。
    会议认为，企业成本工作应当在加强集中领导和加强部门工作的基础上，继续贯彻群众路线的工作方法。在讨论中，代表们一致认为，贯彻群众路线必须抓紧解决这样的几个问题：（一）在企业成本管理上，必须坚持统一领导与厂部、车间的分级管理相结合的原则。统一领导就是以企业为单位，统一计划、统一定额、统一制度、统一核算盈亏。（二）实行集中领导与分级管理相结合的原则，要有适当的形式。例如目前许多企业实行分级核算的形式，就是统一核算和吸引群众参加适当部分的成本管理和成本核算工作的一种形式。因为劳动时间、原材料、燃料和工具等消耗，都是职工直接经手掌握的，工人参加管理，人人关心成本，才能以最少量的人力物力生产出更多更好的产品。（三）厂矿企业要重视和加强成本计划工作。应当认识到，成本计划是调动群众积极性的重要杠杆。作好成本计划工作，就能及时地提出先进而又落实的指标和措施，就能鼓舞群众的斗志。（四）加强协作配合。部门之间、车间之间、班组之间，必须密切协作，树立整体思想，提倡共产主义的协作精神。（五）在发动群众加强成本工作中，要掌握政策界限。既要大力节约原材料和工时消耗，又要保证产品的质量；既要提高设备利用率，又要注意设备的正常保养和维修；既要关心生产，又要关心工人的生活和安全；既要注意成本单位的利益，又要考虑其他部门和国民经济的整体利益；既要注意眼前利益，又要考虑长远的利益。只要按照政策办事，才能达到多快好省的目的。会议还认为，加强成本工作，必须加强企业和车间的职能部门的成本管理和核算工作，不要把那些应当由职能部门办的事情，也都推给群众去办。不要以为有了群众参加，成本管理和核算工作就可以不要或者削弱企业职能部门的管理了。那种把职能部门的管理同群众参加管理对立起来的看法，是不正确的。
    会议还特别强调指出，加强企业的成本工作，必须健全必要的规章制度。规章制度的作用是引导人们按照一定的规范去行动，这是有秩序地进行生产活动所必需的，也是有秩序地进行财务成本工作所必需的。
    在整顿和健全规章制度的时候，必须根据具体情况，加以分析，该建立的要马上建立起来，破了旧的要有新的去代替。在必要的制度未建立以前，也可以暂时用旧的，等建立起新的再破旧的。今年应当逐步整顿和健全成本计划管理，成本核算办法，成本开支范围，资金管理和财务开支等项规章制度。
