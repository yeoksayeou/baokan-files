    Ode to the Tenth Anniversary of International Children's Day
    In November 1949, it was decided in Sujing that the International Children's Day would foster young sprouts with internationalism, benefiting the people with great achievements.
    Feudal disasters plagued China for thousands of years, and the ancient teachings of caring for children were empty words. Class oppression never ceased, and the principle of "treat my children well, and then treat other people's children well" was never followed.
    Imperialism wantonly invaded, planning to weaken the nation by weakening its people. Public morality was lost, and children were brutally abused and exploited.
    Rich children lived in extravagance, tired of delicacies, while poor children barely had coarse food to fill their stomachs. With gaunt faces and emaciated bodies, wearing rags, they begged from door to door, a truly heartbreaking sight.
    Growing up as loafers without shame, corrupted by the decadent talk of a beautiful life, they engaged in adultery, robbery, and plunder, the ultimate harm of capitalism.
    Communist education follows the truth, starting with the "five loves" and "three goods" from childhood. Caring and cherishing them to the utmost, cultivating the next generation is a joyous achievement.
    Everywhere in urban and rural areas, we are delighted to see healthy children dressed in red and green. Not only do they sing together with full bellies, but the "Young Pioneers" and "Communist Youth League" provide comprehensive education.
    Ten years of nurturing has produced remarkable sprouts, a garden of colorful flowers of the motherland. Soon they will grow strong and become pillars, taking over the construction of a new China!

    颂六一节十周年纪念
    李济深一九四九十一月，苏京议定六一节，国际主义育幼苗，造福人群功伟烈。封建祸华几千年，慈幼古训托空言，阶级压迫迄不冺，幼吾无复人幼先。帝国主义肆侵略，亡国计从人种弱，公德丧尽横摧残，虐杀儿童甚剥削。富儿骄侈厌膏梁，贫儿藜藿难充肠，鹄面鸠形衣百结，沿门讨乞情堪伤。长沦阿飞不知耻，腐化侈言生活美，奸淫掠夺尽所为，资本毒害伊胡底。共产教育循真理，五爱三好孩提始，关怀爱护及至微，培养下代功可喜。城乡处处欣瞩目，康健儿童衣红绿，非惟鼓腹共讴歌，“少先”“共青”宏乐育。十年树人茁奇芽，万紫千红祖国花，行看壮大成梁栋，接班建设新中华！
