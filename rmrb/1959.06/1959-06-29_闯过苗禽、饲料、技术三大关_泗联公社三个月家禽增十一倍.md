(Shanghai, June 28th) The Silianshe Commune in Songjiang County, Shanghai, has seen a dramatic increase in the number of chickens, ducks, and geese by elevenfold in just over three months, averaging twenty-one poultry per household.

The collective and individual poultry farming of the commune members are developing simultaneously. The number raised by the commune, production teams, and canteens accounts for 67.7%, while those raised privately by commune members account for 32.3%.

In developing poultry farming, the commune established specialized organizations and leadership structures from top to bottom and focused on the faster-developing production teams, setting examples, holding on-site meetings, and promoting the practice across the board. A "four checks and four comparisons" competition was launched between teams, small teams, and individuals: checking the number of poultry, growth rate, survival rate, and feed consumption; comparing who raises more, grows faster, raises better, and saves more feed.

In the development of poultry production, in addition to strengthening political leadership, the Silianshe Commune also organized efforts to break through the three major hurdles of seedlings, feed, and technology. For example, the commune's breeding farm dispersed roosters to various production teams to increase the number of fertilized eggs and improve the hatching rate. In terms of hatching, the commune established earthen jar hatcheries and also fully mobilized the masses to use hens to hatch chicks and ducklings.

The commune relied on the masses to solve the feed problem, adopting the methods of "letting go, catching, and collecting." "Letting go" means grazing in the wild, allowing chickens and ducks to forage for scattered grains and wild insects in the fields and paddy fields; "catching" means mobilizing the elderly and children to dig up earthworms and catch loach, recording work based on quantity or purchasing with cash; "collecting" means purchasing fish heads, fish tails, and other substitute feeds from outside (mainly for feeding laying ducks).

To ensure that poultry are raised well and kept alive, the commune, based on sixty-four experienced duck farmers, organized a technical research committee and held training classes for more than eighty people. They imparted techniques through on-site visits, experienced farmers guiding novices, and learning by doing, cultivating more than three hundred new technical backbones to strengthen the technical force. During the seedling duckling period, each production team also specially selected experienced duck-raising commune members to concentrate on feeding the ducklings for half a month. After the danger period, they were then divided into groups for raising. The same was done for raising chicks, with experienced chicken farmers concentrating on raising them for a period of time before distributing them to commune members for private raising. Through these methods, the survival rate of seedlings was greatly improved, with an average survival rate of over 80% across the commune.

In the process of developing poultry, each production team also adopted the method of raising large and small groups separately so that chickens and ducks could eat evenly and grow rapidly. Generally, meat ducks raised for sixty days can reach a weight of three and a half catties each. The three thousand meat ducks of the Sanxing production team, raised for two months, averaged four catties in weight.

In order to promote the rapid development of poultry production, each production team also fully implemented the "three guarantees to the small team" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing output, and guaranteeing cost) and "five fixings to the individual" (fixing people, fixing targets, fixing quality, fixing measures, and fixing rewards) responsibility system for collectively raised chickens and ducks.

### 闯过苗禽、饲料、技术三大关  泗联公社三个月家禽增十一倍

    闯过苗禽、饲料、技术三大关
    泗联公社三个月家禽增十一倍
    本报上海28日电　上海市郊松江县泗联公社在三个多月内，鸡、鸭、鹅数量猛增十一倍，平均每户饲养家禽二十一只。
    这个公社集体和社员个人饲养家禽同时大发展。公社、生产队、食堂饲养的数目占67.7％；社员私养的占32.3％。
    在发展家禽中，公社由上到下建立了专业组织和领导机构，并以发展较快的生产队为重点，树立榜样，召开现场会议，全面推广。在队与队、小队与小队，以及人与人之间开展了四查四比竞赛：查只数、生长速度、成活率、饲料消耗；比养得多、长得快、养得好、饲料省。
    泗联公社在发展家禽生产中，除了在政治上加强领导外，并组织力量闯过了苗禽、饲料、技术三大关口。例如公社种禽场，将公鸡分散到各生产队饲养，以增加有精蛋，提高孵鸡率；在孵化工作上，公社建立了土缸孵坊，同时还充分发动群众用母鸡孵小鸡小鸭。
    这个公社依靠群众解决饲料。采取的办法有“放、捉、采”。“放”即野外放牧，让鸡鸭在场地上、白水田里，寻食零星粮食和野生虫草等；“捉”就是发动老年、小孩挖蚯蚓，捉泥鳅，以量记工，或现金收购；“采”即是向外采购鱼头鱼尾等代饲料（主要是喂蛋鸭）。
    为了保证家禽养活养好，公社以六十四个养鸭能手为基础，组织技术研究委员会，举办八十多人的训练班，通过现场参观、老手带新手、边教边学的办法传授技术，培养了三百多名新的技术骨干，充实了技术力量。在苗鸭期间，各生产队又专门挑选有经验的养鸭社员，将小鸭先集中喂养半个月，危险期过后，再分群饲养。养小鸡也是这样，先由养鸡能手集中养一个时间，待大毛出齐后，再分给社员私养。通过这些方法，苗禽成活率大大提高，全社平均成活率80％以上。
    在发展家禽过程中，各个生产队还采取大小分群饲养的方法，使鸡鸭吃食均匀，迅速成长。一般饲养六十天的菜鸭，每只体重可达到三斤半。三星生产队三千多只菜鸭，饲养两个月，平均重量达到四斤。
    为了促进家禽生产的迅速发展，各生产队对集体饲养的鸡鸭，还全面贯彻执行了三包到小队（包工、包产、包本）、五定到人（定人、定指标、定质量、定措施、定奖励）的饲养责任制。
