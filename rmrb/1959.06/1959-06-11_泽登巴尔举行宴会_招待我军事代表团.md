He said that the Chinese Communist Party has creatively applied Marxist-Leninist doctrines to build a new China and has achieved great successes. Our people sincerely admire the achievements of the Chinese people.

In the past few days, we have been warmly welcomed and cordially received by the Mongolian people and the comrades-in-arms of the Mongolian People's Army.
