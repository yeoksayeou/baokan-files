Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 24th: More than 3,000 representatives from all circles in Hanoi held a rally on the evening of the 23rd for the upcoming "Day of Struggle to Force US Troops to Withdraw from South Korea." The conference passed a resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.

This rally was jointly convened by four mass organizations: the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Vietnam Committee for Asian-African People's Solidarity, and the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor.

Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, spoke at the conference. He emphasized that US imperialism is the most dangerous enemy of world peace and the people of all countries today. The current division of Korea was also created single-handedly by American warmongers.

Hoang Quoc Viet said that the most pressing task at present is to force the United States to get its troops out of South Korea, so as to create favorable conditions for contact between North and South Korea, in order to resolve the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea as soon as possible. He said that this is the deepest desire of all the Korean people, and also the desire of the people of the world.

Trinh Tae-hwa, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, also spoke at the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Peace Committee, the Japan-Korea Association, and the Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee issued a joint statement today, calling on the Japanese people to support the proposal to designate June 25th as "Day of Struggle to Force US Troops to Withdraw from South Korea."

The statement said that the presence of American troops in South Korea poses a serious threat to peace in Asia. South Korea has now become a base for atomic war.

The statement demanded that all American troops withdraw from South Korea, and pointed out: "The Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea in October of last year. Today, the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea is the only necessary condition for the peaceful resolution of the Korean problem."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 24th: According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency today, the Miners' Trade Unions International has written to its member unions and other miners' unions in various countries, calling on them to support the Korean people's struggle to force the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and to peacefully reunify Korea on June 25th.

The Miners' Trade Unions International called on miners' unions in various countries to send telegrams or letters to the Central Committee of the Korean Mining Workers' Trade Union to express their solidarity with the Korean people.
