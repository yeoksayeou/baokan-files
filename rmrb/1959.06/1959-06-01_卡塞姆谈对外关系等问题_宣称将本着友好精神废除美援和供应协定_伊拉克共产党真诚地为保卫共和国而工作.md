Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, May 31st - Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem, when meeting with British journalist Anthony Nutting on the 29th, spoke about Iraq's relations with foreign countries and issues related to political parties.

Kassem told the former British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs: "Iraq will abolish the U.S. aid and supply agreements next week in a friendly spirit, and in this way, we will improve relations with the American people."

The old Iraqi regime signed the U.S. Technical Assistance "Point Four Program Agreement" with the United States in 1951, and concluded a "Military Assistance" agreement in 1954. After the Iraqi revolution, a few U.S. "Point Four Program" delegation members remained in Iraq. In August 1958, the United States also shipped a batch of military aid supplies to Iraq.

When talking about issues related to political parties, Kassem said, "The communists active in our country are nationalists. They have not violated the interests of the country so far. They fully cooperate with other citizens and work sincerely to defend the republic." He also said, "I have felt that they are sincere, and sincere people will not become conspirators."

Prime Minister Kassem refuted the claim that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries were attempting to conspire in Iraq and exert pressure on the Iraqi government. He said, "We are friends of Russia, just as we are friends of other countries in the world. Please believe that no country can interfere in our affairs." He said, "Through this period, we have seen clearly that Russia and other countries fully understand our situation."

Talking about Iraq's relations with the UAR, Kassem said, "Our policy is clear. We are working to improve the cultural, economic, and health standards of the people." "Therefore, we will not take any aggressive actions against any country. If any aggressive action occurs, it will come from the other side, not from us. I do not believe that there is any tension, because the threat only comes from the other side. If they stop attacking us, the situation will improve, and the tension arising from there will be eliminated."

In response to Nutting's question about whether the Iraqi People's Court President's fierce attacks on the UAR, the United States, and Britain would affect Iraq's friendly relations with these countries, Kassem said, "This court is trying people accused of conspiring against Iraq. Therefore, the attacks are first concentrated on those countries that colluded with the conspirators, and on the other hand, also on countries that have played such roles in the past."

    卡塞姆谈对外关系等问题
    宣称将本着友好精神废除美援和供应协定
    伊拉克共产党真诚地为保卫共和国而工作
    新华社巴格达31日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆29日在接见英国记者安东尼·纳丁时，谈到伊拉克同外国的关系和有关政党的问题。
    卡塞姆对这位前英国外交国务大臣说：“伊拉克下周将本着友好精神废除美援和供应协定，这样，我们就会同美国人民改善关系。”
    伊拉克旧政权曾经在1951年同美国签订美国技术援助“第四点计划协定”，又在1954年缔结“军事援助”协定。伊拉克革命以后，少数美国执行“第四点计划”的代表团人员仍旧留在伊拉克。1958年8月，美国还曾经把一批军事援助物资运到伊拉克。
    卡塞姆在谈到有关政党的问题时说，“在我们国家中进行活动的共产党人是民族主义者。他们到现在为止没有违背国家的利益。他们同其它公民进行充分的合作，真诚地为保卫共和国而工作。”他还说，
  “我已经感到他们是真诚的，真诚的人们是不会变成阴谋分子的。”
    卡塞姆总理驳斥了所谓苏联和其它社会主义国家企图在伊拉克搞阴谋和对伊拉克政府施加压力的说法。他说，“我们是俄国的朋友，正像我们是世界其它国家的朋友一样。请相信没有任何国家能够干涉我们的事务。”他说，“通过这个时期我们已经看清楚，俄国和其它国家是完全了解我们的情况的。”
    谈到伊拉克同阿联的关系时，卡塞姆说，“我们的政策是明确的。我们正在为提高人民的文化、经济和健康水平而工作。”
  “因此，我们不对任何国家采取任何侵略行动。如果发生任何侵略行动，那是从另一方面来的，而不是我们采取的。我不相信存在任何紧张局势，因为威胁只是从另一方面来的。如果他们停止对我们的攻击，局面就会改善，从那里引起的紧张局势就会消除。”
    在回答纳丁提出的关于伊拉克人民法庭庭长对阿联、美国和英国进行的激烈攻击是否会影响伊拉克同这些国家的友好关系的问题时，卡塞姆说，“这个法庭正在审讯被控阴谋反对伊拉克的人们。因此，攻击首先集中在那些同阴谋分子勾结的国家，另一方面也集中在过去曾经扮演这类角色的国家。”
