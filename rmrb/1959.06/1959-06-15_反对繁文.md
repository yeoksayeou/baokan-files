Expressing opinions, making suggestions, deciding on measures, drafting plans, explaining principles, offering criticism and praise, etc., through writing is inherently a good thing. Firstly, it can be more organized; after thinking and writing it down on paper, it will be clearer and more concise than speaking orally. Secondly, it can save time; reading something written is easier and faster than listening. Thirdly, oral communication has spatial limitations, only possible face-to-face, while written communication is not restricted by distance. Fourthly, for some busy people, written material is easier to schedule time for, and to resolve issues promptly, compared to oral communication. Fifthly, for some important issues, written material is better than conversations because it can be preserved as archival material, making it easier to check and refer to in the future. In short, there are many benefits, too numerous to mention.

However, everything has two sides. Precisely because there are many advantages, problems also arise. Because it is convenient, one can simply write, compared to arranging a meeting, which requires the other party to have time. As a result, documents fly everywhere, even when issues could be resolved face-to-face, which is problematic due to its abundance. Because the article is written by oneself, without time constraints, little consideration is given to the other party's energy, and it becomes longer and longer, coupled with a set of routine formulas and stock phrases, introductions, transitions, and conclusions, which is problematic due to its length. Precisely because it is writing an article, some people cannot help but show off their talents, citing various examples, or quoting scriptures, using this to say that, starting with polite and flattering words, making a grand introduction, circling around and around, even making several more circles, before getting to the point and stating the true intention, and finally concluding in the same circling manner, which is problematic due to its emptiness. Abundance, length, and emptiness, these three combined are the crimes of bureaucracy.

Documents are always necessary; no matter what society or era, there must be documents. However, it becomes a bad thing when it turns into an "-ism", and must be opposed.

There have been many famous bureaucrats in history. It is said that Qin Shi Huang read official documents, "weighing them by the stone," with the documents so numerous that they were weighed by the stone, reading so many pounds of documents a day. Emperor Wen of Sui read official documents, even while eating, "guards passing meals while he ate," which seems ridiculous. Upon closer reflection, it is not so ridiculous. Originally, paper had not yet been invented in the time of Qin Shi Huang, and the official documents he read could only be bamboo or wooden slips, with very few words written on each slip, so reading dozens or hundreds of pounds a day was not that much. By the time of Emperor Wen of Sui, paper already existed, so there was no need to weigh them by the pound. Sometimes he was busier, and dealt with things while eating, which was reasonable, as long as it wasn't every meal, otherwise he would develop stomach problems, but there is no such record in history. It seems that neither of these two can be considered bureaucrats.

The real bureaucrat was Emperor Taizu of Ming, which is verifiable in historical records. According to the record in the Veritable Records of Emperor Taizu of Ming, taking the received documents in September of the 17th year of Hongwu (1384 AD) as an example, from the 14th to the 21st of that month, within eight days, the memorials from various internal and external departments totaled 1,660, containing 3,391 matters. On average, he had to read or listen to more than two hundred reports a day, and deal with more than four hundred matters. He was trapped in a vast ocean of documents, with no end in sight, and was very distressed.

Having suffered, one must oppose and struggle. Emperor Taizu of Ming suffered from bureaucracy and became a staunch opponent of bureaucracy. He called documents that were empty and lengthy "tedious writing." Once he had a major outburst, beat someone, and rectified the situation. The story is as follows: Some literati in history liked to write ten-thousand-word memorials. There was a person named Ru Taisu, a principal of the Ministry of Justice, who had passed the imperial examinations at the provincial level, and liked to write. He wrote a seventeen-thousand-word memorial, explaining current affairs. Emperor Taizu of Ming had someone read it to him. After reading six thousand three hundred and seventy words, he had not yet stated any concrete facts, but only vaguely said that the people employed by the court were all pedantic and vulgar officials. Emperor Taizu of Ming was furious, summoned him, and asked, "You are in the Ministry of Justice, which has more than two hundred people. Who are the pedantic officials? Who are the vulgar officials? Who are you referring to?" He repeatedly questioned him, but he could not answer. He became even more angry and beat him. The next night, he had someone read it again, and only after hearing sixteen thousand five hundred words did he get to the main topic, suggesting five matters, four of which were feasible. These five matters totaled only five hundred words. He got up early and had someone handle the four feasible matters. He also praised Ru Taisu as a loyal minister, saying: "Now I am tired of listening to tedious writing and question loyal ministers, it is my fault." He admitted the mistake of beating him. He also pointed out that Ru Taisu could have explained the matter clearly in five hundred words, but instead wrote seventeen thousand words, which was the fault of tedious writing. In order to correct this problem, he stipulated a format for making suggestions, promulgated it throughout the country, and wrote a preface about the incident himself, printed it in the front (Biography of Ru Taisu in the History of Ming, Volume 139, Preface to the Format for Making Suggestions in the Collected Works of Emperor Taizu of Ming, Volume 15). This happened in the ninth year of Hongwu (1376 AD). However, eight years later, in 1384, he still had to read more than two hundred documents a day. It seems that the problem of emptiness and length may have improved somewhat, but the abundance had not changed.

Another famous figure who opposed tedious writing was Hai Rui. Hai Rui also passed the imperial examinations at the provincial level, but was the opposite of Ru Taisu, advocating for simplified documents. Some people might think that Ru Taisu wrote for others to read, so he wrote a lot, while Hai Rui read other people's writing, so he advocated for less writing. However, I have carefully studied his collected works. His articles, letters, memorials, and treaties were indeed not long and not empty. In the third year of Wanli (1575 AD), as Right Vice Censor-in-Chief, he patrolled and governed ten prefectures of Yingtian. Upon taking office, he issued a treaty (proclamation), one of which was to reform documents. The treaty said:

Today's various malpractices cannot be completely eliminated, but generally speaking, documents are too tedious. This court cannot say everything at once, and each official should consider it on their own, mainly focusing on simplicity. In all matters, there is no need to copy so many previous cases. For urgent matters, use abbreviated excerpts. For matters discussed by the prefectures and counties themselves, use one sentence if one sentence is enough, use two or three sentences if two or three sentences are enough, use a single sheet of paper if a single sheet of paper is enough, use a long sheet of paper if a long sheet of paper is necessary, just to ensure that nothing is omitted. Officials should draft their own manuscripts and give them to clerks to transcribe, and should not give everything to the clerks, which would lead to complexity. The confessions should follow the example of the Ministry of Justice, using concise words to draft the case and give it to the clerks to transcribe. If you understand the key points, the matter will not be laborious, and there is no need to use clerks to issue documents, or use so many words. Simplify it, simplify it! Matters originate from officials, not from clerks, and the day of clear customs and the elimination of malpractices will come (Hai Rui's Memorabilia, Volume 3).

In summary, it is just a few words. First, be simple and concise, and only select important excerpts when citing previous cases. Second, do not say empty words. Say one sentence if one sentence can make it clear. Use a single sheet of paper if a single sheet of paper can be written on, just to explain it clearly without omission. Third, do it yourself. Officials should draft their own manuscripts and not rely on clerks, who can only help with copying. These points are very clear and specific. Not only are they suitable for the situation at the time, but they still have some reference value today.

    反对繁文
    吴晗
    通过文字来表达意见，提出建议，决定措施，拟出方案，讲清道理，批评表扬等等，本来是件好事。因为第一可以比较有条理，经过思考，写在纸上，比口头说会更清楚些，扼要些；第二可以节省时间，书面的东西看起来要比听的省事些，省时些；第三口头讲有空间的限制，只能面对面讲，书面的不受距离的限制；第四对某些工作忙的人来说，书面的东西要比口头讲话更易于安排时间，及时解决问题；第五对某些重要问题，书面的东西要比谈话好，因为可以保存起来，作为档案材料，以后便于查对、参考。总之，好处甚多，不一而足。
    但是，事物总是有两面性的，恰恰因为好处多，毛病也出来了。因为方便，拿笔一写便是，比之约会面谈，必须对方有工夫才行，这样，文字便满天飞了，连可以面谈解决的也用文字代替了，其病在多。因为文章由自己写，不受时间限制，便不大考虑对方的精力，越写越多，再加上一套例行公式套语，起承转合，其病在长。也正因为是在写文章，有的人不免要卖弄才华，多方引譬，或者引经据典，借此说彼，开头要讲些客气话，冠冕一番，绕了圈子，一圈再一圈，甚至再来几圈，才入正题，说出本意，最后归结，还得照样绕圈子，其病在空。多，长，空，这三条合起来就是文牍主义的罪状。
    文牍总是要的，不管是什么社会，什么时代，总得有文牍。但是，一成为主义就坏事了，非反对不可。
    历史上有许多著名的文牍主义者，据说秦始皇看公文，“衡石量书”，文书多到论石秤，一天要看多少斤文件。隋文帝看公文，连吃饭的时间也在看，“卫士传餐而食”，看来很可笑。仔细一想，倒不怎么可笑了。原来秦始皇的时候纸还没有发明，他看的公文只能是竹子或者木头的简牍，一片写不了多少字，那么一天看个几十百把斤，并不算多。隋文帝时已经有纸了，不必论斤，他有时候忙一些，吃饭时带着办点事，也是理所当然的，总不会顿顿如此，要不然非闹胃病不可，但史书上并无这项纪载。看来这两人都不能算是闹文牍主义。
    真正的文牍主义者是明太祖，这是有史料可查的。据明太祖实录的纪载，以洪武十七年（公元1384）9月间的收文为例，从这月14日到21日，八天内，内外诸司奏札凡一千六百六十件，计三千三百九十一件事情。他平均每天要看或者听两百多件报告，要处理四百多件事情。他陷在文牍的汪洋大海中，四望无边，而且无穷无尽，实在苦恼得很。
    吃了苦头，就要反对，就要斗争。明太祖吃了文牍主义的苦，成为文牍主义的坚决反对者了，他把犯有空而长罪状的文件叫作繁文，有一次大大发作了一顿，打了人，整顿了一下。故事是这样的：历史上有些文人好上万言书，有一个叫茹太素的刑部主事，举人出身，好弄文墨，写了一万七千字陈说时务的意见，明太祖叫人读给他听，读了六千三百七十字，还没有说出具体事实，只是空洞地说朝廷用的人都是迂儒俗吏。明太祖大怒，把他叫来，问你在刑部，刑部有两百多人，谁是迂儒？谁是俗吏？指的是谁？再三盘问，回答不出。越发生气，把他打了一顿。第二天晚上，又叫人再读，一直听到一万六千五百字以后，才讲到本题，建议的五件事情，其中有四件是可行的。这五件事情一共才五百多字。他一早起来，就叫人把可行的四件事情办了。还表扬茹太素是忠臣。说：“今朕厌听繁文而驳问忠臣，是朕之过。”承认了打人的过失。也指出茹太素把五百多字可以讲清楚的事情，却写了一万七千字，这是繁文之过。为了改正这种毛病，他规定了建言格式，公布全国，自己把这事情的经过写成序文，印在前面。（明史卷一百三十九茹太素传，明太祖文集卷十五建言格式序）。这是洪武九年（公元1376）的事情。但是，过了八年，到了1384年，他每天还得看两百多件文件，看来，空而长的毛病也许好一些了，多却没有改。
    反对繁文的另一著名人物是海瑞。海瑞也是举人出身，却和茹太素相反，主张简省文移。有人可能这样想，茹太素是写给人看的，就写得多，海瑞是看人家的文字的，就主张少写了。不过，我倒用心研究过他的文集，他的文章，信札，奏疏，条约，的确不长，也不空洞。他在万历三年（公元1575）以右副都御史巡抚应天十府，一上任就发出条约（布告），其中一项就是改革文移，条约说：
    今日诸弊，不能尽革，大概在文移过繁。本院一时不能尽言，各官自行酌量，一以简省为主。凡事不必抄写前案许多，紧急者略节用之。府县所自议，说话一句而尽者止用一句，二三句而尽者用二三句，当用片纸者用片纸，当用长纸者用长纸，止使事情不遗便是。要官自作稿付吏誊，不可尽付吏书，以致繁琐。其有供招，一如刑部例，简切数语，起草付吏誊案。若识机括，事本不劳，不必用吏书行移，用许多说话也。省之，省之！事由于官，不由吏书，风清弊绝有日矣。（海瑞备忘集卷三）。
    总括起来，也不过几句话，第一要简单扼要，引用前案只拣重要的节录。第二不要说空话，说一句可以明白的就说一句，片纸可写的就写片纸，只要讲清楚不遗漏就行。第三要亲自动手，要官自作稿，不可假手吏书，吏书只能帮着抄写。这几条很明确，很具体，不但适合当时情况，在今天来说，也还是有点参考意义的。
