Leaping Forward Showcase

Avoiding Rock Dust
　　Shen Zuozhou, a mechanical and electrical worker at the No. 2 Well of the Hegang Dongshan Coal Mine, recently created a "pump-type dust collector." When tunneling, if it is attached to the wind drill, it can absorb the rock dust and send it into a bucket, preventing rock dust from flying around the work area. This dust collector is beneficial for maintaining the cleanliness of the work area and protecting the health of the tunneling workers.

No Fear of Electric Leakage
　　Luo Jin, a worker from the repair group of the Lingnan Chemical Factory in the Western District of Guangzhou, created a "leakage circuit breaker" to address the problem of electric motors being prone to leakage when damp or when using electric drills. It is equipped with a switch. When installed on an electric motor or drill, if leakage occurs, the switch will trip, and the motor will immediately stop running automatically, which is very helpful for ensuring safe production.

Cloth Resistant to Water and Fire
　　The Dongxin Textile Factory in Shenyang uses ammonium phosphate urea to treat cotton fabrics, giving these fabrics water and fire resistant properties. They call this cloth "high-efficiency double-protection cloth."

Effort-Saving Pipe Wrench
　　Geological personnel active in the deep mountains of Chengde have successfully manufactured an automatic pipe wrench that can tighten a pipe in two seconds. In the past, it took six or seven people swinging sledgehammers, working up a sweat, to tighten a pipe in one and a half to two minutes.

Radiation Goggles
　　The state-owned Shanghai Glass Factory has recently successfully trial-produced universal radiation goggles.
　　These glasses can prevent occupational diseases such as infrared cataracts and electric ophthalmia; they can be used by steelworkers, welders, glassblowers, and X-ray operators.

·Steel Wire Mesh Cement Boat·
　　Recently, a sky-blue speedboat has been sailing on the calm waters of the Songhua River. This speedboat is not made of steel plates or wood, but of cement and steel wire mesh by the workers of the Harbin Shipbuilding and Repair Factory.
　　The speedboat is nine meters long, two point one meters wide, has a draft of zero point four five meters, a displacement of four point five tons when empty, and a still water speed of twelve kilometers per hour.
　　Building ships with cement and steel wire mesh not only saves steel but is also simple to manufacture, with a short construction cycle. Counties and communes can manufacture them themselves according to their needs.

    跃进橱窗
    不让岩粉飞扬
    鹤岗东山煤矿二井机电工人沈作舟，最近创造了一种“带泵式防尘器”。掘进的时候，把它套在风钻上，它就能够把岩粉吸收进去，通到水桶里，场子面不会再有岩粉飞扬。这种防尘器对保持场子面清洁和保护掘进工人的健康有好处。
    漏电不用怕
    广州市西区岭南化工厂修配组工人罗金，针对电动机在受潮和使用手电钻时容易漏电的问题，创制成功一个“漏电断路器”，里面装有开关掣。把它装在电动机和电钻上，如果遇到漏电，开关跳动，电动机便能马上自动停止转动，对保证安全生产很有帮助。
    不怕水火的布
    沈阳市东新染织厂用磷酸铵脲处理棉织物，可以使这种棉织物具有防水防火的效能，他们把这种布称做“高效双防布”。
    省力拧管器
    活跃在承德深山区的地质人员，制造成功自动拧管器，两秒钟就可拧好一根管子。过去双手拧，六七个人抡大锤，累的满头大汗，一根管子得拧一分半到两分钟。
    辐射护目镜
    国营上海玻璃厂最近试制成功万用辐射护目镜。
    这种眼镜可以预防红外线白内障、电光性眼炎等职业病；可供炼钢工、电焊工、玻璃吹制工及X光操作者使用。
    ·钢丝网水泥船·
    在平静的松花江水面上，最近有一艘天蓝色的汽艇在航行。这艘汽艇不是用钢板或木材制造的，而是哈尔滨船舶修造厂职工用水泥与钢丝网造成的。
    这艘汽艇总长九公尺，宽二点一公尺，吃水零点四五公尺，空船排水量四点五吨，静水航速一小时为十二公里。
    用水泥和钢丝网造船不但可以节省钢材，而且制造简单，建造周期短，各县、公社都可根据需要自行制造。
