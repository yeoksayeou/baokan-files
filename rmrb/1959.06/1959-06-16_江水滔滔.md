The steamboat carried me from the lower reaches of the Songhua River into the Heilong River. Under the clear blue sky, white fish eagles searched for food close to the surging waves, and dense clusters of poplar and broad-leaved willow trees stretched along the riverbank into the distance. The river was vast, the waves rolled, presenting a magnificent beauty, arousing people's lofty, solemn, and profound emotions.

The northern bank of the river is the Soviet Union. Looking out the window on the boat, I could clearly see the beautiful and orderly residences of the Soviet people, the trucks racing across the fields, and the beautiful headscarves fluttering on the heads of Soviet girls strolling along the river. A gust of river wind brought a faint fragrance. A crew member said softly: "Ah, these are Soviet pear blossoms..." Everyone was intoxicated by this beautiful scene. At this moment, a ship flying the Soviet flag was braving the wind and waves towards us. The crew members of both countries raised their flags to each other and sounded their horns in salute. Then everyone cheered enthusiastically, as if they had met long-lost relatives....

Traveling on the Heilong River is a happy experience, because you can see and hear many stories about the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. The great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is like the water of the Heilong River, with a long source and a continuous flow. Old stories are unforgettable, and new, even more touching stories are constantly happening.

One morning this spring, two workers from the "856" farm were sailing down the river in a small sailboat. When they set sail, the sky was clear, the sun was bright, and the wind was calm. But in the middle of the journey, a strong wind suddenly rose. The workers fought the river water that kept pouring into the cabin with strong will and perseverance. They had to reach their destination before dark, because there were no houses on the dozens of miles of riverbank, and waiting for them in the dense forests were black bears, wild boars, and vicious wolves... The small sailboat swayed and moved in the river, and large waves splashed into the cabin, soaking the workers. Suddenly, they heard a whistle behind them, and when they looked back, they saw a steamship flying the red flag with a hammer and sickle following them unhurriedly. This steamship had been following the small sailboat for several tens of minutes. The workers wiped the sweat from their foreheads, breathed a sigh of relief, and shouted happily: "Ah, the Soviet elder brother is escorting us!" At this moment, a huge wave crashed, and the cabin was half full of water, and it looked like the small sailboat was about to sink. The Soviet crew rescued the workers onto the steamship, and towed the small sailboat all the way to their destination.

In the dense forest on the bank of the Heilong River, there is a village called Xiabacha. It is inhabited by the Hezhe people who live by fishing and hunting. A Hezhe woman held up her chubby son, who had just turned one year old, and told me the story of how she named him Antroshka: In the spring of 1958, she had just given birth to this child, but the placenta had not come out. She fainted due to excessive bleeding, and the situation was very critical, but the hospital was far from the village. The local government decided to send a telegram to the neighboring Soviet government for help. Soon, a helicopter from Boli (Khabarovsk) in the Soviet Union landed in the village. A Soviet female doctor walked out of the plane. After her diagnosis, she said: "As long as she can hold on for fifty minutes, there is hope if we fly back to Boli." Without even drinking a cup of tea, she took the mother and child on the plane and flew away. The Soviet doctor performed surgery and gave her a blood transfusion, saving her life. After she recovered, the female doctor flew her and her child home. Before leaving, the Soviet people gave her and her child many clothes, and the female doctor specially gave her a watch, repeatedly urging her to feed the child on time, and named the child—Antroshka.

Fuyuan is a beautiful county town located in the northeasternmost corner of the motherland, bordering mountains and facing the river. In Xishan Park, which faces the river, stands a monument, which was built to commemorate the Soviet soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Fuyuan. One day, the Fuyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party received a letter from the Soviet Union, written by a Soviet naval lieutenant. The letter said: His best friend was the first to rush to the river bank in the battle to liberate Fuyuan, using explosives to destroy the Japanese Kwantung Army's bunker, and at the same time he heroically sacrificed himself... Now, whenever he sails on the Heilong River and the Wusuli River, when he looks up at the Martyrs' Monument, he can't help but feel excited and deeply mournful, but when he sees the great changes that have taken place in Fuyuan after its liberation, he feels greatly gratified, because his friend's blood has irrigated the flowers of Sino-Soviet friendship and yielded fruitful results. He asked the county party committee to tell him about the great achievements Fuyuan people had made under the leadership of the Communist Party... Wei Zhanguo, secretary of the Fuyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, finished telling me this story and said excitedly: "The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is forged with blood!"

Listening to these exciting stories, I was deeply moved. I envy the people who live on the banks of the Heilong River, because they can feel the warmth of the socialist family more than people in other places, and they can more deeply appreciate the spirit of proletarian internationalism. This great emotion subtly influences people's character, cultivates people's lofty thoughts, beautiful sentiments, and sincere feelings.

    江水滔滔……

    汽船把我从松花江下游带进黑龙江。在碧蓝的天空下，白色的鱼鹰贴着波涛汹涌的江面寻食，密密丛丛的钻天杨和阔叶柳沿着江岸向远方伸展。江水浩荡，波浪滚滚，呈现着一种雄伟的美，唤起了人们的崇高、庄严、深沉的感情。
    大江北岸就是苏联。在船上临窗眺望，能够很清晰地看见一幢幢美观整齐的苏联人民的住宅，原野上奔驰着的卡车和在江边散步的苏联姑娘飘动着的美丽的头巾。一阵江风吹来，带来一股淡淡的清香。一位船员轻轻地说：“呵，这是苏联的梨花……”大家都沉醉在这优美的景象里。这时，一艘挂着苏联国旗的航船正迎着我们乘风破浪而来。两国船员们彼此举起旗帜，鸣笛致意。接着大家就热情地欢呼，就像遇见了久别重逢的亲人……。
    在黑龙江上航行是幸福的，因为可以看到和听到许多有关中苏人民友好的故事。中苏人民的伟大的情谊就像黑龙江水一样，源远流长，滚滚不断。旧的故事使人永难忘怀，而新的更为动人的故事正在源源不断的发生。
    今年春天的一个早晨，“八五六”农场的两个工人驾着小帆船顺江而下。出航的时候天晴日朗，风静浪平。中途却突然卷起大风来。工人们用坚强的意志和毅力跟不断涌进船舱来的江水搏斗。他们必须在天黑以前赶到目的地，因为在几十里长的江岸上，没有一户人家，而在密林丛树中等待他们的则是黑熊、野猪和恶狼……小帆船歪歪斜斜的在江中行驶，一个个大浪向舱内扑来，工人的全身已经浇湿。突然，他们听到背后有汽笛声，回头一望，却看见一艘挂着镰刀斧头红旗的汽船不紧不慢地在后面尾随着他们。这条汽船紧跟着小帆船已有几十分钟了。工人们揩干了额上的汗水，轻松地吁了一口气，高兴地喊道：“呵，苏联老大哥在给我们护航哩！”这时，一个巨浪扑来，舱里进了半舱水，眼看小帆船快要沉没了。苏联的船员把工人救上汽船，拉着那条小帆船一直把他们送到了目的地。
    在黑龙江岸上的密林丛中，有个村庄叫下八岔。这里聚居着以渔猎为生的赫哲族人。一个赫哲族妇女举起她那胖胖的刚满一周岁的儿子告诉我她的安特罗什加命名的故事：1958年的春天，她刚生下这个孩子，胎衣却没有下来。她因流血过多而昏厥过去了，情况非常危急，但是医院离村庄很远。当地政府决定拍封电报向邻近的苏联政府求援。马上，一架从苏联伯力来的直升飞机在村里降落了。飞机里走出一位苏联女医生。她诊断后说：“只要她能支持五十分钟，飞回伯力就有救。”她茶都没有喝一口就把母亲和孩子载上飞机飞走了。苏联的医生替她动手术、输血，把她救活了。她痊愈后，那位女医生又乘飞机把她和孩子送回家。临行时，苏联人民送给她和孩子许多衣物，那位女医生还特意赠送给她一个表，再三叮咛她要按时给孩子喂奶，并且给孩子起了名字——安特罗什加。
    抚远是一个傍山临江、位于祖国最东北角的美丽的县城。在临江的西山公园里，巍巍屹立着一座纪念碑，这是纪念为解放抚远而牺牲的苏军烈士们修建的。有一天，中共抚远县委接到一封来自苏联的信，写信的是一位苏联海军尉官。信上说：他的最好的朋友在解放抚远的战斗中第一个冲上江岸，用炸药炸毁了日本关东军的碉堡，同时自己也英勇牺牲了……现在，每当他在黑龙江和乌苏里江航行，抬头望见烈士纪念碑，总是抑止不住自己的激动和悼念的深情，但当他看到抚远解放后面貌起了巨大的变化，又感到莫大的欣慰，因为他朋友的鲜血已经灌溉了中苏友谊之花，结出丰硕之果。他要求县委把抚远人民在共产党领导下取得的巨大成绩告诉他……中共抚远县委书记魏占国同志对我讲完了这个故事，激动地说：“中苏两国人民的友谊是鲜血凝成的！”
    听着这些激动人心的故事，我深深地被感动了。我羡慕生活在黑龙江边的人们，因为他们比别的地方的人能更多的感受到社会主义大家庭里的温暖，能更深的体会到无产阶级的国际主义精神。这种伟大的感情潜移默化的影响着人们的性格，培育着人们崇高的思想，优美的情操，真挚的感情。
