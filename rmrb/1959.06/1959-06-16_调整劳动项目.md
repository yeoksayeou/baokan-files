    Adjusting Labor Projects
    The middle schools of Hefei city have promptly taken positive measures to adjust labor projects and properly arrange teaching and productive labor. This approach can be a reference for every school.
    Since last year, schools have been running factories on a large scale and have also established ties with many factories, farms, and people's communes. The results have been significant, and the students have gained a lot. However, some schools have had too many labor projects, and the students' labor time has been too long. Timely adjustments should be made to meet the needs of teaching and the students' physical strength, so that teaching and productive labor can be carried out normally and harmoniously.

    调整劳动项目
    合肥市各中等学校，及时采取积极措施，调整劳动项目，妥善安排教学与生产劳动；这样的作法，每一个学校都是可以参考的。
    去年以来，学校大办工厂，还和许多工厂、农场、人民公社挂了钩，成绩都很大，学生的收获也不小。但是，有的学校在劳动项目方面是多了一些，学生的劳动时间也长了一些。应当及时调整，以适应教学的需要和学生的体力，让教学和生产劳动正常地协调地开展起来。
