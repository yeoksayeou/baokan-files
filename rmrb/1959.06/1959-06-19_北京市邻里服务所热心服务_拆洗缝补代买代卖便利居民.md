Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Reporter Shen Lizhu reports: More than one hundred neighborhood service stations (posts) scattered throughout the streets and alleys of Beijing's urban areas have recently been continuously adding and changing the services they provide to neighborhood residents, based on their own conditions and the season.

More than seventy service stations in the Xicheng District have generally added services such as washing and mending clothes, repairing old and damaged materials, and providing boiled water. The nine people's service stations around Dongsi in the Dongcheng District have generally added the service of purchasing tram and bus monthly passes on behalf of residents. The nine service stations around Fusuijing, which originally handled postal and savings services, telephone calls, and the sale of newspapers and periodicals, have now added more than twenty services such as painting houses and repairing doors, windows, and tables and chairs. The Zhongjie service station recently added more than ten new service items, such as weather forecasts, moving services, arranging for doctors, buying medicine, and claiming lost property.

These neighborhood service stations are a new type of residential service organization that emerged after street residents participated in production. Their continuous improvement of services has brought many conveniences to the daily lives of neighborhood residents. After more than ten service stations in the Erlong Road area began selling boiled water, some families stopped using their stoves solely for boiling water, saving manpower and coal. The service stations in the Fusuijing area have washed more than 10,000 pieces of clothing for nearby residents in half a month and have also repaired a large number of leather shoes and casual shoes.

Most of the people working in the service stations are housewives and some street activists; a small number are residents who are idle at home or have retired and voluntarily work in the service stations.

    北京市邻里服务所热心服务
    拆洗缝补代买代卖便利居民
    据新华社18日讯　记者沈骊珠报道：分散在北京城区大街小巷的一百多个邻里服务所（站），最近根据本所条件和季节情况，不断增添和改变为邻里居民服务的项目。
    西城区七十多个服务所，普遍增加了拆洗缝补衣服、修理旧损物资和供应开水等项目。东城区东四一带的九个人民服务站，普遍增添了代购电车、汽车月票的业务。福绥境一带的九个服务所，原来代办邮政，储蓄业务，传呼电话，代卖书报，现在增加了粉刷房屋和修理门窗桌椅等二十多种业务。中街服务所最近新添了天气预报、代搬家、代请医生、代买药、招领失物等十多种服务项目。
    这些邻里服务所，是街道居民参加生产以后出现的一种新的居民服务组织。它们服务工作的不断改进，给邻里居民们的日常生活带来了很多方便。二龙路一带的十多个服务所代售开水后，有的家庭便停止了只为烧开水而生的炉子，节省了人力和煤炭。福绥境一带的服务所半个月内已给附近居民洗衣一万多件，还修理了大量的皮鞋、便鞋。
    在服务所工作的人，大部分是家庭妇女和一些街道积极分子，少部分是闲居家中或已经退休而自愿到服务所工作的居民。
