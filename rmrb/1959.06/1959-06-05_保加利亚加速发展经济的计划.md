Bulgaria, Samliyev

	The year 1958 undoubtedly occupies a special place in the political history of socialist Bulgaria. This was the year of the Party's Seventh Congress. In the months following the Congress, a great movement of the people was launched to shorten the timeframe for completing the Third Five-Year Plan. Comrade Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, said in his summary report at the Congress: "Due to the achievements in the development of the national economy and the real development of national productive forces, we can determine the main economic and political tasks for the next period: to further develop the socialist material production base and, on this basis, continue to meet the material and cultural needs of the working people."

	From November 15 to 17 last year, an enlarged plenary session of the Party Central Committee was held. The plenary session discussed Comrade Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee's report outline on "Accelerating the Development of the National Economy, Raising the Material and Cultural Level of the Working People, and Improving State and Economic Leadership." After the report outline was published, a wide-ranging discussion was held for more than a month. Across the country, whether in factories and agricultural production cooperatives, mines, power stations, or logging sites, it can be said that no labor collective was outside the movement to tap potential and strive to complete the prescribed tasks.

	The Third Session of the Bulgarian National Assembly, held in March this year, unanimously endorsed Comrade Zhivkov's above-mentioned report and adopted corresponding laws. Below, I will discuss the plan for the development of our country's economy and culture over the next seven years, as outlined in Comrade Zhivkov's report and the laws passed by the National Assembly.

	Completing the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years makes it practically possible for our country to basically solve the problems of a domestic steel base, synthetic materials, an industrial agricultural raw material base, and a rapid increase in industrial and agricultural products, as well as reducing product costs, by 1965. The realization of this program will not only improve the material conditions of the working people, but also mean that in a short period of time, the economic and ideological preconditions for a gradual transition to communism will be established.

	As everyone knows, the leading sector of the entire national economy is industry, especially the iron and steel and machine manufacturing industries. For a country like ours, which ten to twelve years ago still imported all kinds of machines, motors, and other metal products from abroad, the establishment of its own steel base and related domestic machine manufacturing industry is of great significance.

	In order to ensure the technological progress of all sectors of the national economy, the development speed of the machine manufacturing industry must be drastically increased. The total output of the machine manufacturing and metal processing industries will more than double compared to 1957, the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan, and will increase more than fourfold by the end of 1965.

	Geologists have discovered a huge iron ore deposit near Sofia, with reserves of 260 million tons, which can be used to build a medium-sized steel plant. This steel plant is currently under design and will be fully operational by the end of 1965. It is expected that around 230,000 tons of pig iron will be produced by 1962, and should reach 700,000 tons by 1965. Domestic steel production will reach 400,000 tons by 1962, and around 900,000 tons by 1965.

	That is to say, by 1962 we will be able to meet about 30% of our own needs with our own products; and by 1965, we can meet about 52% of our needs.

	Non-ferrous metallurgy will also have great development. Roughly speaking, lead production will reach 45,000 tons in 1962, and 90,000 tons in 1965.

	If the power industry develops more slowly than other industries and cannot guarantee supply, then no industry can move forward. Therefore, the development speed of the power industry sector is very high. Bulgaria's electricity production may reach 6 to 7 billion kilowatt-hours by 1962, and may reach 10 billion kilowatt-hours by 1965. Last year, our country's electricity production only reached more than 3 billion kilowatt-hours, which shows the kind of leap forward that will occur in this area. Calculated on a per capita basis, electricity production in our country was 392 kilowatt-hours per person in 1958, ranking first among the Balkan countries.

	The coal industry will also have great development. In the next stage, coal production will reach 19 million tons, and what is particularly important is that more than half of the production will be from open-pit mining. According to this indicator, Bulgaria will rank among the world's top countries. Last year, Bulgaria averaged 1,649 kilograms of coal per person.

	The chemical industry is an indispensable sector for achieving technological progress. Therefore, it is planned that by the end of 1962, the output of the chemical industry will increase by about two times compared to 1957, and will increase by about six times by 1965. Our country is currently building a giant oil processing plant, which will initially process imported oil. Geological exploration for new oil production sites is being intensified. Bulgaria already has a modern factory for producing chemical fertilizers. Around one million tons of mineral fertilizers will be produced by 1962, and more than 1.6 million tons will be produced by 1965. This will ensure that an average of 30 kilograms of mineral fertilizer is obtained per decare (one decare equals one and a half mu in our country), compared to only 4.5 kilograms in 1958.

	Light industry and the food industry will also achieve great development. Light industry production will double compared to 1957, and will double by 1965. In this way, the country will be able to obtain 350 million meters of cotton cloth in 1965 (more than 168.8 million meters were produced in 1958, an average of 21.8 meters per person), and 30 million meters of woolen fabrics (14,222,500 meters were produced in 1958).

	The canned food industry also has great development because it has an excellent raw material base.

	The second major sector in the national economy is agriculture. Comrade Zhivkov's report put forward extensive plans for further consolidating and developing the cooperative system in the countryside. In this regard, the countryside has great potential because the merger of agricultural production cooperatives has been realized, a technical revolution is underway in agriculture, and after the reorganization of state institutions, it is possible to send a large number of experienced political and economic cadres to the countryside. At the same time, the system of requisitioning agricultural products has been abolished, and a system of unified purchase of agricultural products has been established. In addition, a series of measures have been taken to make the members materially concerned about the results of their labor. The implementation of all these measures will help to double agricultural production by the end of 1965.

	The plan presented by Comrade Zhivkov in his report to the National Assembly is a leap forward plan for our country's economic development. For example, according to official materials, from 1948 to 1957, the growth rate of industrial production was 16%. This year the growth rate will reach more than 27%. In the past, some people believed that our country's economic development should be smooth. Practice has proven that this view has nothing in common with socialist reality. The gradual development of our country's economy has reached a certain quantitative accumulation, which makes it possible to realize a leap forward now. When talking about the movement to shorten the time limit for completing the Five-Year Plan, Comrade Zhivkov has repeatedly emphasized that we should not be afraid of and hinder the leap forward movement of society. On the contrary, it is more correct to ensure good and consistent leadership to achieve the determined leap forward. The Party has achieved this in our country, especially because this leap forward is not sudden, but the natural result of the past wholehearted work of the Party's cadres and non-Party patriots and all the people.

	The further development of productive forces has created favorable conditions for greatly improving the material and cultural level of the people. In recent years, the minimum wage will be increased from 400 levs (Bulgarian currency) to 600 levs, and the wages of teachers, doctors, scientific workers and employees in certain other departments will be increased. The transition to a seven-hour working day or an eight-hour working day with a five-day working week will be gradually implemented. In addition to these measures, if we add the large-scale construction of housing, public utilities, and cultural life currently underway in our country, we can say that the Bulgarian people will rank among the top in the world in terms of living standards.

	Compared with our elder brothers – the Soviet and Chinese peoples – our country has a small population, totaling less than 10 million people. However, in the current struggle between the socialist and capitalist systems to compete peacefully for time, our people's task of completing the Third Five-Year Plan in a shortened period is also a modest contribution to this struggle. Inspired by the ideas of proletarian internationalism, the Bulgarian people are striving for new achievements in the economic development of their country and for the complete construction of a socialist society. There is no doubt that after this task is solved, it will bring the Bulgarian people closer to communism. It is clear that the construction of a communist society will be the cause of the current generation of socialist builders. (Attached images)

    保加利亚加速发展经济的计划
    保加利亚  萨姆利耶夫
    在社会主义保加利亚的政治史上，1958年无疑占有特殊的地位。这是举行过党的第七次代表大会的一年。在代表大会以后的几个月，展开了人民群众争取缩短完成第三个五年计划期限的伟大运动。党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫同志在代表大会的总结报告中说：“由于国民经济发展中所取得的成就和全国生产力的真正发展，因此我们有可能确定下一时期的主要经济和政治任务：进一步发展社会主义物质生产基础，并在此基础上继续满足劳动人民对物质和文化的需求”。
    去年11月15日到17日，举行了党中央委员会扩大全会。全会讨论了中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫的关于“加速国民经济的发展，提高劳动人民的物质生活和文化水平，以及改进国家和经济领导”的报告提纲。报告提纲公布后，进行了一个多月的广泛讨论。在全国，无论是工厂和农业生产合作社，矿山、电站或是伐木场，可以说没有任何一个劳动集体是站在挖潜力争取完成规定的任务的运动之外的。
    今年3月召开的保加利亚国民议会第三次会议，一致拥护日夫科夫同志的上述报告，并通过了相应的法律。下面谈一谈日夫科夫同志的报告和国民议会通过的法律中有关今后七年内我国经济、文化发展的计划。
    三、四年内完成第三个五年计划，就有实际可能使我国在1965年以前基本上解决国内的钢铁基地、合成材料、工业的农业原料基地和急速增加工业和农业产品，并降低产品成本等问题。这个纲领的实现，不仅会改善劳动人民的物质状况，而且意味着在不长的时期内将建立起逐步过渡到共产主义的经济和思想的先决条件。
    大家知道，整个国民经济的主导部门是工业，特别是钢铁和机器制造业。对于像我们这样一个在十年至十二年以前还从国外进口一切种类的机器、马达和其他金属产品的国家，建立自己的钢铁基地和与之相关联的本国的机器制造业具有多么重大的意义。
    为了保证国民经济各部门的技术进步，必须急剧提高机器制造业发展的速度。机器制造业和金属加工业的总量将比1957年，即第二个五年计划的最后一年，增加两倍多，到1965年底将增加四倍以上。
    地质学家在索非亚附近发现了一个巨大的铁矿，蕴藏量达二亿六千万吨，可供建立一个中型的钢铁厂。这个钢铁厂正在设计中，到1965年末，将全部投入生产。预计到1962年将生产出二十三万吨左右的生铁，1965年应该达到七十万吨。国产钢到1962年将达到四十万吨，而到1965年将达九十万吨左右。
    这也就是说，我们到1962年就可以用自己的产品满足自己30％左右的需要；而到1965年，可满足52％左右的需要。
    有色冶金业也将有很大的发展。大致上1962年铅的生产将达到四万五千吨，而到1965年将达到九万吨。
    如果动力工业比其他工业发展慢，不能保证供应，那末任何工业都不能前进。因此，动力工业部门的发展速度是很高的。保加利亚电力的生产到1962年有可能达到六十至七十亿度，而到1965年可能达到一百亿度。去年我国生产的电力只达三十亿多度，从这个事实就可看出这方面将有怎样的跃进。电力生产按人口平均计算，在1958年我国每人合三百九十二度，居巴尔干半岛各国的首位。
    煤炭工业也将有很大的发展。下一个阶段煤的产量将达一千九百万吨，而特别重要的是，产量的半数以上将是露天开采的，按这一指标，保加利亚将居于世界首位的行列。去年，保加利亚平均每人合一千六百四十九公斤煤。
    化学工业是取得技术进步不可缺少的部门。因此，计划到1962年末，化学工业的产量要比1957年增加两倍左右，而到1965年将增加六倍左右。我国目前正在建设巨型石油加工厂，开始时将加工进口的石油。新的石油产地的地质勘探工作正在加紧进行。保加利亚已经有一个生产化学肥料的现代化工厂。到1962年将生产一百万吨左右的矿物肥料，而到1965年将达一百六十万吨以上。这样将可保证每狄卡尔（一狄卡尔合我国一亩半）土地平均获得三十公斤矿物肥料，而1958年只有四点五公斤。
    轻工业和食品工业也将取得很大的发展。轻工业的生产将比1957年增加一倍，到1965年将增加两倍。这样，1965年全国将可得到三亿五千万公尺棉布
  （1958年生产了一亿六千八百多万公尺，平均每人二十一点八公尺），三千万公尺毛织品（1958年生产了一千四百二十二万五千公尺）。
    罐头工业也有很大的发展，因为它有很出色的原料基地。
    国民经济中第二个重大的部门就是农业。在日夫科夫同志的报告中提出了在农村进一步巩固和发展合作制的广泛计划。这方面农村拥有很大的潜力，因为已经实现了农业生产合作社的并社，农业的技术革命正在进行，国家机构改组以后有可能往农村派去大批有经验的政治和经济干部。同时取消了农产品征购制，建立了农产品统购制，此外还采取了一系列措施使社员从物质利益上关怀自己的劳动成果。这一切措施的实现将有助于到1965年底把农业生产增加两倍。
    日夫科夫同志向国民议会所作的报告中提出的计划是我国经济发展的跃进计划。例如，根据正式的材料，1948—1957年间，工业生产增长的速度为16％。今年增长速度将达27％以上。过去，有些人认为我国的经济发展应该是平稳的。实际证明这种意见同社会主义的实际毫无共同之处。我国经济的逐步发展已经达到了数量上的一定积累，这种积累使得现在可以实现跃进。日夫科夫同志在谈到缩短完成五年计划期限的运动时，不止一次地强调指出，不要害怕和阻挠社会向前的跃进式运动。相反地，更正确的是要保证很好的、始终不渝的领导来实现确定好的跃进。党在我国作到了这一点，尤其是因为这个跃进不是突如其来的，而是党的干部和非党的爱国者以及全体人民过去全心全意工作的自然结果。
    生产力的进一步发展，为大力改善人民的物质生活和文化水平创造了优越的条件。在最近几年，最低工资将从四百列弗（保币）增加为六百列弗，教员、医生、科学工作者和其他某些部门的职工的工资将要提高。将逐步实行过渡到七小时工作制或每天八小时工作每周工作五天的制度。除了这些措施以外，如果加上我国目前进行的规模巨大的住宅、公用事业、文化生活建设，我们可以说，保加利亚人民就生活水平而言将列入世界上的首位之一。
    若与自己的老大哥们——苏联人民和中国人民相比，我国人口是很少的，总共不到一千万人。但是在目前进行的社会主义与资本主义体系和平竞赛争取时间的斗争中，我国人民在缩短的期限内完成第三个五年计划的任务也是对这一斗争的微薄的贡献。为无产阶级国际主义思想所鼓舞的保加利亚人民，正在为本国经济发展的新成就，为完全建成社会主义社会而奋斗。毫无疑问，这个任务解决以后，会使保加利亚人民接近共产主义。很明显，建成共产主义社会将是目前这一代的社会主义建设者的事业。（附图片）
