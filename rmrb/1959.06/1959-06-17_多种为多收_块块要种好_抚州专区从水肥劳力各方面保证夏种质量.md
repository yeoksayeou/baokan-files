This is reported from Nanchang on the 16th by our newspaper: Fuzhou Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, while actively expanding the area of summer planting, is doing everything possible to improve the quality of sowing, striving for all first-class seedlings.

Fuzhou Prefecture, due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of "plant more, harvest more," has expanded the planting area of single-season late rice, double-season late rice, and miscellaneous grains from the original plan of 1.8 million mu to 2.3 million mu. After the expansion of the summer planting area, the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately instructed all localities: to strive for more harvests, it is necessary not only to plant more, but also to plant well, and to ensure the quality of sowing. At present, all 700,000 mu of single-season late rice fields in the region have been planted with seedlings; the sowing of 200,000 mu of miscellaneous grain crops has been completed. The sowing quality has basically met the requirements of carefully preparing the land, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and appropriate close planting. In addition, the double-season late rice seedling fields in the region have also been prepared early, and all seeds have been soaked, preparing for the transplanting of double-season late rice.

The primary link for Fuzhou Prefecture to improve the quality of sowing is to ensure the labor force needed for sowing. Due to the expansion of the planting area, the labor force in various parts of the region, especially in mountainous areas, is not sufficient for distribution and use. Under such circumstances, various localities mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and found many ways to solve the problem of insufficient labor. The main methods are: first, comprehensively and rationally arrange the labor force to further tap labor potential; second, establish and improve the production responsibility system; third, strengthen the socialist ideological education of commune members to encourage their enthusiasm for production; fourth, organize cadres, students, and urban residents to provide emergency support for summer planting; fifth, carry out a summer planting tool reform movement. In the summer planting campaign, Lichuan County adopted methods such as squeezing, exchanging, and pressing to draw 50,000 laborers from commune-run industries and canteens, using 50% of the labor force for early rice field management and fertilizer accumulation, and the remaining labor force was divided into various professional teams according to the principle of dividing work according to people and tasks, and invested in summer planting. More than 1,000 youth assault teams were also established, rushing to wherever the summer planting task was arduous. In this way, the 200,000 laborers lacking in the county were solved, and the county's single-season late rice and miscellaneous grain sowing tasks were completed ten days ahead of schedule.

In order to speed up the sowing progress, the entire prefecture also promoted advanced tools such as sowing machines and new-style plows and harrows during the summer planting campaign, reaching 350,000 pieces, increasing work efficiency by more than one time on average.

With the expansion of the summer planting area, the need for fertilizer has greatly increased. Therefore, various places in the prefecture actively opened up fertilizer sources and launched a summer fertilizer accumulation upsurge. The main methods of accumulating and making fertilizer are: 1. Cutting green leaves and green grass to make compost; 2. Using rice husks mixed with topsoil to fumigate fertilizer; 3. Using soil cellars to ferment fertilizer; 4. Burning lime and digging gypsum; 5. Burning grass ash and fire soil ash; 6. Returning rapeseed and wheat straw to the fields for composting; 7. Combining with sanitation and hygiene to accumulate fertilizer; 8. Collecting fertilizer (collecting wild manure) and exchanging fertilizer (exchanging wall and stove soil); 9. Accumulating livestock manure; 10. Massively manufacturing indigenous chemical fertilizers. To date, the region has accumulated and manufactured 190 million dan of farm manure and more than 29,000 tons of indigenous chemical fertilizer for summer crops; single-season late rice has been applied with an average of more than 100 dan of base fertilizer per mu, and each mu of miscellaneous grain crops has been applied with 20 dan of base fertilizer, which is double that of last year.

In addition, various localities have also solved the difficulty of insufficient seeds after expansion by organizing cooperation, mutual adjustment, and economical use, so that sufficient seeds were sown in every field.

This prefecture has more rain in spring and less rain in autumn, so ensuring sufficient water conservancy irrigation for summer crops is an important measure to strive for more harvests after planting more. Therefore, all parts of the region have drawn a group of people to build more than 100 new water conservancy projects next to the expanded fields, and repaired more than 1,000 mountain ponds and reservoirs, so that the region has expanded the irrigation area by 770,000 mu and improved the irrigation area by 210,000 mu this year, which can basically eliminate drought and flood disasters. In order to solve the shortage of water conservancy facilities for summer crops, the Longxi Commune of Linchuan County found the following four methods: 1. Launch an assault to build small reservoirs and ponds; 2. Select old farmers to serve as water release personnel, use water scientifically, and improve water use efficiency; 3. Add waterwheels to improve work efficiency; 4. Carry out cooperation and adjust water use between teams and groups. After these methods were implemented, the difficulty of insufficient water conservancy for the 2,000-plus mu of summer crops expanded by the Longxi Commune was completely resolved.

Another aspect of Fuzhou Prefecture's improvement of summer sowing quality is the implementation of rational close planting. Before sowing, the region summarized the experience of close planting of early rice this year. On this basis, various communes and production teams successively held close planting planning meetings combining cadres, old farmers, and technicians. After full democratic discussion, different specifications for rational close planting were formulated according to the specific conditions of each region. During sowing, various localities also organized thousands of inspection teams to inspect the sowing quality on a rotational basis to ensure the thorough implementation of the close planting specifications.

    多种为多收　块块要种好
    抚州专区从水肥劳力各方面保证夏种质量
    本报南昌16日电　江西省抚州专区在积极扩大夏种面积的同时，千方百计提高播种质量，力争全部长出一类苗。
    抚州专区由于认真贯彻多种多收的方针，全区一季晚稻、二季晚稻和杂粮播种面积已由原计划一百八十万亩，扩大到二百三十万亩。夏种面积扩大之后，中共抚州地委立即指示各地：要争取多收，不仅要种的多，而且要种的好，切实保证播种质量。现在全区七十万亩一季晚稻田，已全部插上了秧苗；二十万亩杂粮作物已经结束了播种。播种质量都基本达到了精整土地、施足底肥、密植适宜的要求。此外，全区二季晚稻秧田也提早整理就绪，并全部浸下了种籽，为栽插二季晚稻做好了准备。
    抚州专区提高播种质量的首要一环，是保证播种的劳力需要。由于播种面积的扩大，全区各地、尤其是山区的劳动力不够分配使用。在这种情况下，各地发动群众出谋定计，找到了不少解决劳力不足的办法。主要的办法：一是全面的合理安排劳动力，进一步挖掘劳动潜力；二是建立与健全生产责任制；三是加强对社员的社会主义思想教育，鼓舞社员的生产积极性；四是组织干部、学生和城市居民突击支援夏种；五是开展夏种工具改革运动。黎川县在夏种运动中，采取挤、换、压等办法，从社办工业、食堂中抽调出五万个劳动力，用50％的劳动力搞早稻田间管理和积肥，其余劳动力根据因人因活分工的原则，分别组成各种专业队投入夏种，并成立了一千多个青年参加的突击队，哪里夏种任务艰巨，就到哪里突击。这样，全县缺少的二十万个劳动力就得到解决，提前十天完成了全县一季晚稻和杂粮的播种任务。
    为了加快播种进度，全专区在夏种运动中还推广了播种机和新式犁耙等先进工具达三十五万件，平均提高工效一倍以上。
    随着夏种面积的扩大，需要的肥料大大增加。因此，全专区各地积极开辟肥源，掀起了夏季积肥高潮。积肥造肥的主要办法是：一、割青叶、青草沤肥；二、用谷壳拌地皮泥熏肥；三、土窖焖肥；四、烧石灰、挖石膏；五、烧草木灰、火土灰；六、油菜、小麦稿秆还田沤肥；七、结合搞清洁卫生积肥；八、收肥（收集野粪）、换肥（换墙、灶土）；九、积牲畜肥；十、大造土化肥。至今，全区已为夏种作物积造了一亿九千万担农家肥料，二万九千多吨土化肥；一季晚稻平均每亩施了一百多担基肥，每亩杂粮作物施了二十担底肥，比去年增加了一倍。
    此外，各地通过组织协作互相调剂、节约使用等办法，还解决了扩种后种子不足的困难，使丘丘田地播下了足够的种子。
    这个专区春季雨水多，秋季雨水少，因此保证夏种作物的充分水利灌溉，便是多种之后争取多收的一个重要措施。因此，全区各地抽出一批人马，在扩种的田地旁新建了一百多座水利工程，整修了一千多座山塘、水库，使全区今年扩大了七十七万亩灌溉面积、改善灌溉面积二十一万亩，可以基本消灭水旱灾害。临川县龙溪公社为了解决夏种作物的水利设施不足，社员们找到如下四个办法：一、突击修建小型水库、水塘；二、选出老农担任放水员，科学用水，提高用水率；三、添置水车提高工效；四、开展协作，队与队、组与组之间调剂用水。这些办法执行后，龙溪公社扩种的二千多亩夏种作物，水利不足的困难便完全得到了解决。
    抚州专区提高夏种播种质量的另一个方面是实行合理密植。播种前，全区在总结今年早稻密植经验的基础上，各个公社、生产队先后召开了干部、老农、技术员三结合的密植规划会议，经过充分的民主讨论，根据各个地区具体情况分别制订了不同的合理密植的规格。播种时，各地又组织了上千个检查组巡回检查播种质量，保证了密植规格的彻底执行。　（刘光辉）（附图片）
