    Thoughts From a Cartoon
    Zhang Zilai

    Recently, I saw a cartoon on a certain unit's blackboard newspaper: a bright light bulb protested to its sleeping owner: "I need to rest too."

    Seeing this cartoon made me think a lot.

    There is this fact: When making phone calls, people are often anxious because "the line is busy." Why is the line busy? — Some people use the phone to solve problems even when they are only a short distance away; some people often exchange greetings and chat idly on the phone.

    There is also this fact: Some people don't turn off the faucet properly after using water from the tap, causing the water to run continuously; some people use several buckets of water to wash one piece of clothing, and even rely on the force of tap water to wash clothes, calling it a "流水作业法" (assembly line method).

    There is also this fact: Some people are careless when copying materials. If they write a few words wrong, they tear up the whole sheet of paper and throw it into the wastepaper basket.

    "A trickle of water forms a river." These small things in daily life, although generally considered "insignificant," waste an unknown amount of resources. Saving should not only start from the big picture, but also from the trivial details of daily life, saving more funds for the country in all aspects.

    At the same time, these small things in daily life also reflect a person's communist moral quality. You should know that caring for and cherishing public property is an indispensable and important part of communist morality.

    We cannot just shout slogans about saving, nor can we just shout slogans about communist morality; let's start with the small things in daily life in a down-to-earth manner.

    从一幅漫画想起的
    张紫来
    最近，看到某单位的黑板报上画了这样一幅漫画：发亮的电灯向它已经睡着的主人提出抗议：“我也要休息”。
    看了这幅漫画使我想了很多。
    有这样的事实：打电话时，常因“线路不空”而使人焦急。线路为什么不空呢？——有的仅距咫尺，也要用电话解决问题；有的常在电话里寒暄、闲扯。
    也有这样的事实：有的人在自来水管放了水后，不将龙头关好，使水不停地流着；有的人洗一件衣服就用几桶水，甚至靠自来水的冲力洗衣服，还美其名曰“流水作业法”。
    还有这样的事实：有的人抄写材料漫不经心，写错了几个字，便把整张纸撕掉往字纸篓一扔了之。
    “涓滴之水，汇成江河”。这些日常生活中的小事，一般人虽认为“无关大局”，但也不知浪费了多少资财。节约不仅要从大处着手，也要从日常生活中的细微末节做起，从各方面为国家节约更多的资金。
    同时，从这些日常生活中的小事上，也反映出一个人的共产主义道德品质问题。要知道，关心和爱护公共财产，是共产主义道德的不可缺少的一项重要内容。
    不能空喊节约，也不能空喊共产主义道德，还是实实在在的从日常生活中的小事做起吧。
