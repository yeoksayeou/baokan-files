Waste paper pulp as a substitute for tanning extract.
Tanning extract is an important material for manufacturing sole leather. The Suzhou City Guangming Leather Factory recently successfully experimented with using waste paper pulp to replace tanning extract. In the past, they used tanning extract for all insole leather production, but now they have completely switched to using waste paper pulp liquid, and the quality of the finished product fully meets requirements. In the past, manufacturing sole leather also relied entirely on tanning extract, but now they are using half tanning extract and half waste paper pulp, and this has also been basically successful.

    废纸浆代烤胶
    烤胶是制造底皮的重要材料。苏州市光明皮革厂最近试用废纸浆代替烤胶成功。过去他们做夹被皮全部用烤胶，现在已完全改用废纸浆液，成品质量完全符合要求。制造底革过去也是全用烤胶的，现在采用一半烤胶，一半废纸浆，也已基本获得成功。
