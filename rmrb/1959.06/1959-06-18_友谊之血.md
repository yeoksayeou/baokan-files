    Blood of Friendship
    Soon after Second Lieutenant Military Doctor Zhou Boying arrived with his unit at Shazhan River in the Lesser Liang Mountains, he heard that Yi ethnic group’s Granny Shama was suffering from a severe heart disease and had been bedridden for more than twenty days, her life hanging by a thread. Without even taking a break to catch his breath, he immediately ran to Granny Shama's home. According to his technical level, treating this kind of heart disease was relatively difficult, but seeing Granny Shama's painful appearance and the sadness of her whole family, he mustered his courage and resolved to cure the disease. He first drew blood from his own body and injected it into Granny Shama to rescue her. Then he flipped through relevant reference materials. As a result, he found a method for treating this type of heart disease in a notebook. After six days and six nights of treatment and care, Granny Shama's condition improved. Granny Shama hugged him and said with tears in her eyes: "It is you - the person sent by Chairman Mao, who saved my old life."
    As soon as Granny Shama recovered, Zhou Boying fell ill due to overwork. Granny Shama, leaning on her crutches, personally cooked soup and rice for him, and told her daughter-in-law, "This is our whole family's relative, you must take good care of him." The two of them took care of Comrade Zhou Boying day and night, feeding him water and food, and slaughtering the only old hen in the house for him to eat.
    When Zhou Boying left Shazhan River, all the Yi people in the village came to see him off. Granny Shama's whole family watched the back of the fleeting, chance-met military officer gradually disappear, and once again shed tears of gratitude.

    友谊之血
    少尉军医周伯英刚随部队到小凉山上的沙战河，听说彝族大妈莎玛患了严重的心脏病，已经卧床二十多天了，命在旦夕。他连气也顾不得歇，立即跑到莎玛大妈的家里。按照他的技术水平，治疗这种心脏病是比较困难的，但他看见莎玛大妈痛苦的样子和全家人的悲伤情景，便鼓起勇气，决心把这病治好。他首先抽出了自己身上的血注射到莎玛大妈身上，进行抢救。一面翻有关参考材料。结果在一个笔记本上翻到了治疗这种心脏病的方法，经过他六天六夜的治疗和护理，莎玛大妈的病情好转了。大妈抱着他，双眼含泪地说：“是你——毛主席派来的人，救活了我这条老命。”
    莎玛大妈的病刚好，周伯英却因辛苦过度而病倒了。大妈扶着拐杖亲自给他烧汤煮饭，并告诉她的儿媳说：“这是咱全家的亲人，你们一定要给看好。”她俩日夜护理着周伯英同志，给他喂水喂饭，并把家中唯一的一只老母鸡杀掉给他吃。
    周伯英离开沙战河时，全寨彝人都来送行，莎玛大妈全家望着这个渐渐消失的萍水相逢的军官的背影，又一次掉下了热泪。
