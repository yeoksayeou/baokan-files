Down-to-Earth, Full of Energy, Accelerate Construction
Secretary of the CPC Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Committee, Xiao Ping

    The first key projects of the expansion of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company – No. 3 Blast Furnace, No. 3 Coke Oven – have been completed and put into production, and the sintering plant has been basically completed and will soon be put into production. No. 3 Blast Furnace is a modern large-scale blast furnace with advanced technological equipment such as high pressure, high temperature, steam blast, and radioactive isotope detection of the furnace bottom, as well as a complete set of modern control systems. The magnificent and completely modernized sintering plant provides high-quality sintered ore to the blast furnace. The modern No. 3 Coke Oven with seventy-one holes can meet the production needs of No. 3 Blast Furnace and the sintering plant. Various ancillary equipment, including the boiler room, pig iron casting machine, railway, and waterways, have also been completed. The completion and commissioning of the three major projects has doubled the company's pig iron production capacity, added a new force to the development of Beijing's industry, and played a certain role in strengthening China's steel production capacity. This is a major victory achieved by all employees of our company under the care of the Central Committee and the correct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and with the enthusiastic support of over 300 fraternal units in 21 provinces and cities across the country after a year of struggle.

    The three major projects commenced on May 28, 1958. The workload was considerable, including 920,000 cubic meters of earthwork, over 18,000 tons of mechanical equipment and metal structure installation, and 45 kilometers of railway laying. Under the conditions of insufficient technical strength and limited construction machinery, the ability to complete No. 3 Blast Furnace, No. 3 Coke Oven, and basically complete the sintering plant in just one year with good engineering quality is a result of launching mass movements under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party, implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and implementing the principle of the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game and communist collaboration.

    Starting Early and Acting Quickly Wins Time

    At the end of 1957, the State Council approved the expansion of Shijingshan Iron and Steel. When the good news came, people were encouraged. Within a week, employees throughout the company put forward 1,697 rationalization proposals, determined to "struggle hard for three years and build a base." The broad masses of production workers squeezed out single dormitories for over 3,000 people to welcome the capital construction workers. At the same time, they actively tapped the potential of the old enterprise, initiating the formation of railway teams, waterway teams, and instrument workshops on the basis of existing types of work to build railways, pipelines, and install all instruments and meters themselves. The repair workers of the entire company undertook the task of manufacturing some non-standard equipment for the expansion project. In this way, we fully utilized the base role of the original enterprise. Employees transferred from various places to build Shijingshan Iron and Steel were also enthusiastic and motivated, throwing themselves into the battle as soon as they got off the train. They took materials locally on the banks of the Yongding River, mining sand and gravel themselves. The Mechanical Power Plant originally planned to build a factory building, but to save investment, they renovated abandoned pigsties as factory buildings.

    The construction of the three major projects started early and acted quickly, winning time in the preparation stage. First, in terms of design, decentralized design was changed to centralized design, and the Black Metallurgy Design Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Anshan Coking Design Institute and other units undertaking the design tasks were invited to the company to conduct on-site design. At the same time, internal technical forces were concentrated to provide information for the design, and design plans were jointly determined by combining leading cadres, veteran workers, and technical personnel. This greatly reduced paperwork and saved time, improved design quality, and shortened the design of the three major projects from fifteen months to seven months. During the preliminary design, as soon as the design plan was determined, we immediately placed orders with fraternal factories based on the list of main equipment. Therefore, when the preliminary design was completed, one-half of the equipment had already been ordered. We also implemented the method of simultaneous preparation and construction. We constructed the base on one hand, and started construction on the other hand. Workers prefabricating reinforced concrete built a temporary shed, used road wood as pillars, set up a mixer, and started production, producing various prefabricated components early for construction purposes. Later, the construction base was gradually built as the construction developed. All of this enabled the three major projects to strive for high speed from the very beginning and enter the first peak of construction during the preparation stage.

    In order to complete the three major projects as soon as possible, we adopted the combat policy of shortening the battle line and concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles. In the first half of 1958, of the 21 expansion projects of our company, 16 were fully started. At that time, it was still necessary to start several more projects in order to avoid work stoppages when the design was not completed. However, by July, due to the overly long battle line, labor, materials, and construction machinery could not be used in a concentrated manner, resulting in the monthly plan not being completed and the project progressing very slowly. We decided to change the entire construction deployment according to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, implement the concentration of superior forces, focus on key projects in batches, and determined to focus on the three major projects first. From then on, the three major projects entered a tense construction phase.

    Among all the construction projects of the three major projects, we implemented project ranking based on the situation of being heavy in the heavy and urgent in the urgent, and made overall arrangements and unified scheduling for all the manpower and materials for construction. The main equipment of the sintering plant, the exhaust fan, arrived late, so we first transferred the installation workers to the blast furnace to participate in the battle. After the blast furnace construction was basically completed, we concentrated our efforts on the construction of the coke oven. When refractory bricks for the coke oven could not arrive in a concentrated manner, after discussion by the masses, a phased construction method of first building the northern half, then building the southern half, and then building the chimney was adopted, which greatly advanced the construction period. During the construction process, the broad masses of employees made great efforts in technical revolution, launched a race for rapid construction, and implemented advanced construction methods such as pressure grouting, overall hoisting, and three-dimensional cross-parallel assembly line operations. Many heroic figures emerged in the movement, such as "Steel Bar King" Peng Chengxiao, "Master of Geography" Diao Xiang, concrete commando Zhao Enrong, and fitter Chen Shiying, who created rapid construction records in seven battles and seven victories. In this way, we accumulated small victories into big victories and gradually completed the entire project rapidly.

    Seeking More, Faster on the Basis of Better, More Economical

    More, faster, better, and more economical are a unified and inseparable whole. Only more, faster on the basis of better, more economical is reliable high speed. Over the past year, we have adhered to the principle of overall leap forward of more, faster, better, and more economical, and while striving for high speed, we have followed the Party's "a century-old plan, quality first" and the principle of building the country through diligence and frugality. We have adopted relatively modern high standards for the main building structures and equipment of the three major projects, but for auxiliary facilities, we have reasonably adopted relatively low standards under the condition of ensuring the full play of the production capacity of the main equipment. For example, the furnace shell of the hot blast stove left over from Japan was of poor quality and could not guarantee the normal operation of No. 3 Blast Furnace during high-pressure blast operation, so it was dismantled and rebuilt; however, the molten iron from the blast furnace can be directly cast into blocks by the pig iron casting machine, and there is no need to use a sand bed for iron casting in the iron tapping yard, so the area of ​​the iron tapping yard was reduced. This ensures the quality of the project and saves investment. In the construction process, we also implemented a quality inspection system that combines professional institutional inspection as the main method and mass self-inspection as the auxiliary method. We conducted strict scientific appraisals of the quality of all projects, especially the performance of major equipment. For example, we used the radioactive element Cobalt-60 to appraise the quality of the blast furnace shell weld seams, and conducted "destructive tests" on key equipment by adding together all kinds of highest requirements, and it could only be used if it passed the appraisal. This ensures the excellent quality of the project. For example, we strengthened safety production education, mobilized the masses to strictly abide by safety operating procedures, and under complex conditions such as dense personnel, three-dimensional intersections, and high-altitude operations, no fatal accidents occurred in the construction process of more than one year.

    This unified view of more, faster, better, and more economical must be implemented throughout the entire construction process. However, in a certain period, it is necessary to grasp the main contradiction and focus on solving it according to the transformation of contradictions. For example, the equipment could not arrive and be complete in time, which affected the speed of construction. In response to this problem, we actively and proactively sought foreign aid; on the other hand, we mobilized the masses to manufacture equipment that we could manufacture ourselves through self-reliance. Party secretaries and managers of the company went to various places twelve times to urge the delivery of goods and place orders. The equipment work cadres we sent to the production sites of the contracting units worked with them, helping to find materials and organize cooperation to promote the early delivery of equipment. The repair workers of the entire company rushed to manufacture more than 2,000 tons of non-standard equipment day and night to provide complete sets. In this way, the needs of the three major projects were basically guaranteed on time, with good quality, and in sufficient quantity. It is very obvious that the main contradiction at this time was no longer a problem of speed but had been transformed into a problem of quality. According to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, we mobilized the masses to conduct inspection and appraisal of the project quality, and at the same time, through construction workers' reminiscence symposiums, we widely inspected various possible quality defects and resolved them in a timely manner. By "May 1st," the equipment was basically installed, and more than 20 days were spent on trial operation and adjustment, so that the production of the three major projects went smoothly after being put into production. On the surface, this seemed to postpone the production date, but it avoided a series of difficulties caused by hasty production and quickly exerted the construction effect, which was actually faster.

    Three Points of Experience:

    1. Both Go All Out and Seek Truth from Facts
    2. Take Care of Both the Main Project and the Auxiliary Project
    3. Combination of Mass Movement and Centralized Leadership

    The construction over the past year has also brought us valuable experience in another aspect: First, we must act in accordance with the objective laws of the development of things, both go all out and seek truth from facts. Any project must have a process from completion to normal production. We can shorten this process, but we cannot surpass this process. It is futile to build one's plan on the basis of subjective wishes that violate objective laws. Second, guiding construction must prevent one-sidedness in thinking, and both the main project and the auxiliary project should be taken care of. Concentrating superior forces to focus on key points must include indispensable auxiliary projects. Otherwise, even if the main project is completed, the performance of production capacity will be limited to a certain extent. In addition, launching mass movements must be combined with centralized leadership, especially in the most tense stage of construction, emphasizing centralized leadership is even more important for quickly and promptly handling various problems.

    It should be pointed out that the three major projects were completed under the favorable situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward. We have received the care of the Central Committee and the Municipal Party Committee and the enthusiastic assistance of the people of the whole country and city, and have received the enthusiastic support of more than 300 fraternal factories in more than a dozen provinces and cities across the country. This is the fundamental condition for us to complete the task. In the work of accelerating the rush to manufacture equipment for Shijingshan Iron and Steel, responsible cadres such as the Secretary of the Dalian Municipal Party Committee and the Minister of Industry of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee held special meetings to make arrangements; Party secretaries and factory directors of fraternal factories such as Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory and Dalian Crane Factory personally took charge, worked alongside the workers, and mobilized the workers to manufacture and deliver the equipment in advance; the Beijing Municipal Party Committee organized all factories in the city to manufacture more than 3,100 tons of non-standard equipment and metal components for the three major projects in a short period of time; railway, civil aviation and other transportation departments also rushed to transport equipment and materials for us. Central state organs, various departments of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, people's communes, universities, middle schools, troops, and groups organized large numbers of cadres, students, and soldiers to come to the factory to participate in voluntary labor, totaling 430,000 workdays, and gave us spiritual encouragement and various material assistance; all of these gave a great encouragement to the employees of our company. We deeply realize that the rapid completion of the three major projects is a fruitful result of the Party's policy of "the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game" and communist collaboration.

    脚踏实地鼓足干劲加快建设
    中共石景山钢铁公司委员会书记　肖平
    石景山钢铁公司扩建的第一批重点工程——三高炉、三焦炉已经建成投入生产，烧结厂已经基本建成，不久就可投入生产。三高炉是一座现代化的大型高炉，它具有高压、高温、蒸汽鼓风、放射性同位素探测炉底等先进技术装备和一套完整的现代化控制系统；雄伟壮观、工艺过程全盘现代化的烧结厂，供给高炉以优质烧结矿；七十一孔的现代化三焦炉，可以满足三高炉和烧结厂生产上的需要。各项附属设备包括锅炉房、铸铁机、铁路、水道等项工程，也已建成。三大工程的建成和投入生产，使我公司生铁生产能力增长一倍，同时为首都工业的发展增添了一支生力军，对壮大我国钢铁生产的能力也具有一定作用。这是我公司全体职工在中央的关怀和北京市委、冶金工业部的正确领导下，在全国二十一个省、市和三百多个兄弟单位的热情支援之下，经过一年奋斗所取得的重大胜利。
    三大工程于1958年5月28日开工。工作量是相当大的，计土方九十二万立方公尺，机械设备和金属结构的安装一万八千余吨，铁路敷设达四十五公里等。在技术力量不足、施工机械不多的条件下，能够在短短的一年内建成三高炉、三焦炉和基本建成烧结厂，并且工程质量良好，这是在党的集中统一的领导下，大搞群众运动，贯彻执行鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的结果，是执行全国一盘棋方针、共产主义大协作的结果。
    起步早行动快赢得了时间
    1957年底，国务院批准石钢扩建。喜讯传来，人心振奋。一周之内，全公司职工提出了一千六百九十七件合理化建议，决心“苦战三年、建成基地”，广大生产工人挤出了三千多人的单身宿舍迎接基建工人，同时，积极发挥旧企业的潜力，倡议在原有一些工种的基础上，组成了铁道队、水道队、计器车间，自建铁路、管道和自装全部计器仪表。全公司的修理工人，承担了为扩建工程制造部分非标准设备的任务。这样，我们就充分发挥了原有企业的基地作用。从各地调来建设石钢的职工，也是热情奋发，一下火车就投入战斗。他们在永定河滨就地取材，自采砂石。机械动力厂原定要盖一所厂房，为了节省投资，把废弃不用的猪圈修改后作为厂房。
    三大工程的建设起步早、行动快，在准备工作阶段就赢得了时间。首先，在设计方面，由分散设计改为集中设计，邀请承担设计任务的冶金部黑色设计院、鞍山焦化设计院等单位来公司进行现场设计，同时集中公司内部的技术力量为设计提供资料，用领导干部、老工人和技术人员三结合的方法共同商定设计方案，这就大大减少了公文往返，节省了时间，提高了设计质量，使三大工程的设计由十五个月缩短到七个月完成。在初步设计进行中，当设计方案确定之后，我们立即根据主要设备的清单向兄弟厂订货，因此，当初步设计完成时，已有二分之一的设备订了货。我们还实行了边准备边施工的方法。一面建设基地，一面开始施工。预制钢筋混凝土的工人搭了个临时席棚，用道木作支柱，架起搅拌机就进行生产，提早制成各种预制构件供施工之用。以后施工基地才随着建设的发展逐步建设起来。所有这些，使三大工程一开始就争得了高速度，在准备工作阶段就进入了施工的第一个高峰。
    为了尽快地建成三大工程，我们采取了缩短战线、集中优势兵力打歼灭战的作战方针。1958年上半年，我公司扩建的二十一个项目中，有十六项全面开工，这在当时设计没有完成的情况下，为避免窝工，多开几项工程还是必要的。但到7月份时，由于战线拉得太长，劳动力、材料、施工机械不能集中使用，致使月度计划没有完成，工程进展非常缓慢。我们便根据市委指示决定改变整个建设的部署，实行集中优势兵力、分批突击重点，并且确定首先突击三大工程。从此，三大工程就进入了紧张的施工阶段。
    在三大工程的全部建设项目中，我们又根据重中有重、急中有急的情况，实行项目排队，对建设的全部人力物力作通盘的安排和统一的调度。烧结厂的主要设备抽风机到货较晚，我们就先将安装工人调到高炉参加战斗，高炉建设基本就绪，又集中力量建设焦炉。焦炉耐火砖不能集中到达，经过群众讨论，采取先砌北半部、后砌南半部、再砌烟囱的分期施工的方法，使工期大大提前。在施工过程中，广大职工大闹技术革命，展开快速施工的竞赛，实行了压力灌浆、整体吊装、立体交叉平行流水作业等先进的施工方法。运动中出现了“钢筋大王”彭成孝、“地里通”刁祥、混凝土突击手赵恩荣、七战七捷连创快速施工纪录的钳工陈士英等许多英雄人物。这样，积小胜为大胜，逐步把整个工程迅速完成。
    在好省的基础上求得多快
    多快好省是统一而不可分割的整体，只有在好省基础上的多快，才是可靠的高速度。一年来，我们坚持了多快好省全面跃进的原则，在力争高速度的同时，遵循了党的“百年大计，质量第一”和勤俭建国的方针。我们对三大工程的主要建筑结构和设备，都采取了比较现代化的高标准，但是对辅助设施则在保证主要设备生产能力充分发挥的条件下，合理地采取了比较低的标准。例如日本遗留下来的热风炉炉壳质量低劣，不能保证三高炉在高压鼓风操作时正常运行，就拆除另建；但是高炉的铁水可以直接到铸铁机铸块，不必在出铁场采用砂床铸铁，所以将出铁场面积减小。这样既保证了工程质量，又节约了投资。在建设过程中，我们还实行了专业机构检查为主和群众性的自检为辅相结合的质量检查制度，对全部工程质量特别是主要设备的性能，进行了严格的科学鉴定，如用放射性原素钴六十鉴定高炉围板焊缝的质量，把各种最高的要求加在一起对关键性设备进行“破坏性试验”，鉴定合格方能使用。这就保证了工程的优等质量。又如加强了安全生产的教育，发动群众严格遵守安全操作规程，在人员密集、立体交叉和高空作业等复杂的条件下，在一年多的建设过程中，没有发生过死亡事故。
    这种多快好省统一的观点，必须贯串在整个建设过程。但是在一定时期，又必须根据矛盾转化的情况，抓住其中的主要矛盾着重加以解决。例如设备不能及时到达和配套，影响建设的速度。针对这个问题，我们一方面积极主动地争取外援；另一方面又发动群众自力更生地制造自己可能制造的设备。公司党委书记、经理等前后十二次到各地催货订货，我们派出的设备工作干部到承制单位的生产现场，和他们一起劳动，帮助找材料和组织协作，促使设备提前交货。全公司的修理工人，日夜赶制了两千多吨非标准设备，进行配套。这样，就基本上按时、按质、按量保证了三大工程的需要。十分明显，这时的主要矛盾已经不是速度问题而转化成质量问题了。我们根据市委指示，发动群众进行工程质量的检查鉴定，同时通过建设职工回忆座谈，广泛检查各种可能发生的质量缺陷，及时加以解决。到“五一”时设备基本安装完毕，又用了二十多天的时间进行试车调整，使三大工程投入生产后生产顺利。这在表面上看来是把生产日期推迟了，但是避免了仓卒投入生产所带来的一系列困难，迅速发挥了建设效果，实质上则是快了。
    三点经验：
    1、既要鼓足干劲又要实事求是
    2、主体工程附属工程两面兼顾
    3、群众运动和集中领导相结合
    一年来的建设，还给我们带来了另一方面的宝贵经验：首先，要按照事物发展的客观规律办事，既要鼓足干劲，又要实事求是。任何一项工程从建成到正常生产，必然有一个过程，我们可以缩短这个过程，但是不能超越这个过程。硬把自己的计划建立在违反客观规律的主观愿望的基础上，这样的计划就会落空。其次，指导建设必须防止思想上的片面性，主体工程和附属工程两个方面应该兼顾。集中优势兵力突击重点，必须包括必不可少的附属工程在内。否则，即使主体工程建成了，生产能力的发挥也会受到一定的限制。此外，大搞群众运动必须与集中领导相结合，特别是在建设中最紧张的阶段，强调集中领导对于迅速而及时的处理各种问题更有重要的意义。
    应该指出，三大工程是在全国大跃进的有利形势下建成的。我们得到中央、市委的关怀和全国全市人民的热情援助，得到了全国十多个省市三百多个兄弟工厂的热情支持，这是我们完成任务的根本条件。在加速为石钢赶制设备的工作中，旅大市委书记、湖南省委工业部长等负责干部，召开专门会议进行部署；哈尔滨电机厂、大连起重机厂等兄弟厂的党委书记和厂长亲自挂帅，跟班劳动，发动工人把设备提早制成交货；北京市委组织全市各厂在短期内为三大工程制造了三千一百余吨非标准设备和金属构件；铁路、民航等运输部门，也为我们赶运设备材料。中央国家机关，北京市人民委员会各部门，人民公社，大中学校，部队，团体，都组织大批干部、学生、战士来厂参加义务劳动，总计达四十三万个工日，并给我们以精神上的鼓励和物质上的各种援助；所有这些，使我公司职工受到巨大的鼓舞。我们深刻地认识到，三大工程的迅速建成，是在党的“全国一盘棋”方针和共产主义大协作结成的一个丰硕之果。
