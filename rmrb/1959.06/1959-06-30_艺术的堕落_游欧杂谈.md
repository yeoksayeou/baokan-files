The Degeneration of Art
——Random European Notes——
Guān Shānyuè

    In Brussels, there is a National Academy of Architecture and Decorative Arts. When I visited, the president first led us to the oil painting studio. There, a professor with disheveled long hair declared to the guests: "In order not to harm the free expression of students' personalities, I, as a professor, do not play any guiding role, but only handle administrative affairs."

    The president began pointing to a huge oil painting, as shown in the picture, and asked, "Whose work is this?"

    A female student stood up and said, "Mine."

    The president asked, "What are you painting?"

    The girl replied, "Nothing. Whatever you see is what it is."

    The president asked again, "Why don't you even know what you're painting? Don't you have any creative intention?"

    The girl, seeing that the president was a bit angry, had to answer, "I wanted to paint something primitive."

    The professor then asked in an uncertain tone, "What is that huge thing lying in the sky? It looks a bit like a stone to me?"

    The girl replied impatiently, "If you say it's a stone, then it's a stone."

    Since the president was a famous architectural engineer, he quickly noticed that the center of gravity of the huge object in the sky was incorrect, and he continued, "If that is a stone, it is not logical to place it like that; it will fall."

    In this situation, the professor said, "Another stone should be erected on the other end to support the large stone lying in the sky."

    The president disagreed with the professor's inept guidance. He suggested, "Why not hang a balloon on the other end of the stone lying in the sky? Wouldn't that be better?"

    The students were all concentrating on listening and thinking, as if they had gained some new inspiration from these suggestions.

    Later, I asked what the criteria were for judging the quality of student work. The president and the professor said in unison, "There are no standards. There is music in the painting, which can be understood intuitively but not expressed in words. Everyone has the right to say it is good or bad."

The Cat's Intention

    President, having just heard the female student say that her work had no intention, then told the following story: "I heard that an abstract painter, due to his own incompetence, relied on a black cat for help. The painter first pre-applied various colors to the palette, then pressed the cat on it to walk around a few times, so that the cat's paws were covered with colors, and then moved it to a prepared canvas." Speaking of this, one of the students anxiously asked, "Doesn't the cat run away?" The president continued, "It can't run away; it's covered with a wire cage." The president added, "You know, cats are the cleanest animals. It is already very uncomfortable to be trapped in a cage, but the sticky paint on its paws makes it even more uncomfortable. Therefore, the cat doesn't have time to consider escaping, but only considers how to wipe off the paint on its paws. Wipe, wipe, wipe, the paint is wiped clean, and the beautiful painting that the painter hoped for is also completed."

    The president then added, "Here, I don't want to boast about the painter's cleverness, but we should admit that the clean cat's wiping the paint off its paws is intentional, that is to say, it completed this beautiful painting with intention." At this time, the president looked at the female student who painted without any intention and said, "Look, even a cat has intention when it paints, but you don't know what you're painting. Is your talent inferior to a cat?" Although the female student was a bit embarrassed by the reprimand, she laughed along with the other students, and we all laughed. At that time, I secretly observed the students' reactions, and it seemed that they had all satisfactorily gained something from this wonderful story!

A Beer Glass Design

    I was then taken to the craft art department studio. The professor very enthusiastically and patiently introduced his teaching situation to us, the content of the course, which was the design of a beer glass. In this course, the professor stipulated that each student must first write a tens of thousands of words essay on the history of glass development, and a thesis on design and construction, and then make various models of different materials according to the requirements designed in the thesis, including no less than ten kinds of clay, plaster, cardboard, and wood. What we visited was the personal work of one of the professor's proud students. The professor asked the student to introduce himself, and he told us in detail about his learning progress and steps, and particularly emphasized the importance of this textual research work. From his two tens of thousands of words essays and that pile of design models, it fully shows how seriously he took this course assignment. As for concentrating a semester's time and energy solely on this cup for aimless research, this kind of design and construction made me a bit skeptical. In order to find out the truth, I asked the following question: "Is your teaching combined with production?"

    The professor frankly said, "No, production units will not adopt it."

    I immediately asked, "Why?"

    At this time, the student glanced at the professor and replied, "It is said that it is too bulky, and customers don't like it."

Venus's Misfortune

    Once, a Belgian friend accompanied me to see an abstract art exhibition at the Brussels Palace of Fine Arts. After seeing it, he asked my opinion. I didn't have time to embellish my words and I said bluntly, "It stinks." Unexpectedly, this friend greatly appreciated my one-word comment, and he admitted that Westerners do not know how to use their sense of smell to appreciate art. What exactly was the content of this exhibition? In addition to using oil paints, they also used a lot of old newspapers, rags, scrap metal, stamps, tickets, matchsticks, cigarette butts, a dishcloth, and even installed a pipe or hung a string of keys on the canvas. As a result, it became a dirty and smelly garbage dump. Some works were also absurdly priced at more than 100,000 Belgian francs (equivalent to five or six thousand yuan in RMB). As for what is reflected in the sculpture? I also want to give some examples here: I have seen a work made of a curved iron rod, with several straight iron wires placed on it, and a semi-circular small iron ring hung on the upper end. The title of this work is "Motherhood" (as shown in the left picture); another one is made of an iron rod with two sections strung with two iron rings, and the title is "Dream." There are also some piles of disgusting waste materials, called "Potential of Matter" and "Space of Sorrow." Randomly make a few circles, called "Angel." Another one looks like the signboard of an old Chinese store, with various strangely shaped scrap iron pieces and thick cardboard hanging on countless iron bars, swaying in the wind and clanging. This is called "Spatial Sculpture." I heard that this kind of thing is popular in Europe from the United States.

    This is what the abstract art of the bourgeoisie is like, considering the ugliest, dirtiest, and smelliest things to be the most "beautiful." Everyone knows that Venus is the embodiment of beauty in Greek mythology, but in the eyes of bourgeois abstract painters, she is transformed into a strange thing that is nothing, and even depicted as a very terrible demon (as shown in the picture above). This can also be regarded as a masterpiece of artistic creation in the free world!

"Experiment"

    Once, at a Belgian friend's house, I met a relatively young abstract female painter. She brought no less than a dozen recent works to seek my opinion. I couldn't understand any of them, and it was very difficult for me to give my opinion. There was no way, so I had to take the initiative and let her talk about it first. So I randomly picked a painting and asked her: "What is the content of this painting? What do you want to express in it?" She said frankly, "There is no content, and there is no meaning. It's just an 'experiment'." I then asked, "So what is the purpose of your experiment? What is your intention?" Like the female student at the art academy mentioned earlier, she declared, "I have no intention. I just try to see what happens. Whatever comes out is what it is." In order to make me understand her production process better, she pointed to the bizarre and strange colors on a painting and told me very proudly about the methods and steps of her experiment. She said, "First, put the first color on the canvas at random. For example, in this painting, I instinctively applied the golden color first, and then randomly put on black, red, white, green... all kinds of colors gradually. Try it! Paint it! Paint it, try it! Often, you will get unexpected effects." She then added, "If you have intention first, you will not reach this wonderful realm." She probably thought this was her most satisfying masterpiece. Sometimes she would look at it lying flat, sometimes she would look at it upright, and finally she would hang it up, always hoping to find the most suitable angle of light for guests to appreciate it. She couldn't find any reaction from my attitude, and she became a little anxious, so she further added, "Please look carefully, there is music in the painting. The more you look at it, the more wonderful it becomes. Have you found it? I think you will definitely find a lot of things in it..."

Decay Breeds Vermin

    Here, some people may ask, why can abstract painting grow and even spread in Western countries? This is undoubtedly a malformed development of capitalist society, a kind of morbid state. Do ordinary viewers really like abstract painting? According to my understanding, not only do they not like it, but many people even have a strong aversion to it. However, because this genre is considered by some people to be a new thing in the development of painting, a fashionable thing, some people deliberately pretend to be "experts" and greatly appreciate it in order to show that they have culture and cultivation. If they say they don't understand, they will feel that they have lost their status. They know they have been deceived, but they want to deceive others. They pretend to understand what they don't understand, deceiving themselves and others, just like the story of the Emperor's New Clothes in Andersen's fairy tales. For example, when I asked a Belgian friend in Antwerp what he thought of abstract painting, he said, "Very good, there is music in the painting..." In fact, he didn't understand anything. When I further asked where the music was reflected, he was speechless.

    Bourgeois painters also often boast about their noble "art for art's sake" and the freedom to create whatever they want. In fact, their so-called "freedom" is only the freedom to serve their customers. Who are the customers? One is the bourgeois art dealer, and the fate of the painter is in their hands. Anyway, there are no good or bad standards for the works, as long as they meet the requirements of the art dealer boss, they will be favored. And their purpose is to monopolize the art market and make huge profits from it. Another is the reactionary government agencies, which invite painters to exhibit in various member states through the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which is controlled by US imperialism, and at the same time, member states recommend each other for exhibitions. Therefore, whoever wants to be invited, whoever wants to be recommended, whoever wants to be favored by art dealers must sell their souls, stick their necks into the noose, and obediently serve them. The so-called "freedom" and the so-called "nobility" are just complete lies and nonsense.

    I thought of Chairman Mao's very vivid words, "Capitalist society is rotting day by day." Naturally, the decay of a social system must include its politics, economy, culture, and so on. Cultural art is the superstructure of the economic base. If the base is rotten, how can the superstructure not rot? Here again, I am reminded of the idiom "decay breeds vermin". All rotten and smelly things will grow worms, and bacteria will always reproduce in an environment with a temperature and soil suitable for their growth. Isn't that right? Even rotten linen is painted on (as shown in the picture above).

    艺术的堕落
    ——游欧杂谈——
    关山月
    布鲁塞尔有一所国立建筑装饰美术学院，我去参观时，院长首先把我们引到油画工作室里。那里一位披着蓬松长头发的教授首先向客人声明说：“为了不伤害学生个性的自由发挥，我这个教授从不起什么辅导作用，只是作行政事务性的管理而已。”
    院长开始指着如下图的那张巨幅油画问：“这是谁的作业？”
    一个女学生站出来说：“我的。”
    院长问：“你画的是什么？”
    女生答：“没有什么，你看是什么就是什么。”
    院长又问：“为什么你连画的什么都不知道？难道你没有创作意图吗？”
    女生见院长有点生气，只好答：“我想画原始。”
    这位教授接着用不肯定的语气问：“横在天空的那个庞然大物是什么？我看有点像石头？”
    女生有点不耐烦地答着：“你说石头就是石头吧。”
    由于院长是一位著名的建筑工程师，很快就发现天空中这件庞然大物的重心不对头，便接着说：“假如说那是石头，这样摆着是不合逻辑的，将会掉下来。”
    在这个情况下，教授说：“应该在另一端，再竖一块石头，把横在天空的大石支撑起来。”
    院长不同意教授这个低能的辅导，他建议说：“横在天空的石头的另一端，吊上一个轻气球，岂不更妙？”
    学生们都在集中精力地听着、想着，好像从这些辅导中得了什么新的启示。
    后来，我问到学生作业的好坏标准怎样？院长和教授异口同声说：“没有什么标准，画里有音乐，可以意会，不可言传。谁都有权利说它好，或说它坏。”
    猫的意图
    院长先生刚刚听见那个女学生说他的作业是没有什么意图的，于是他就讲了下面这样一个故事：“听说有一个抽象派画家由于自己无能，于是借助于一只黑猫来帮忙。画家预先把各种各样的颜色涂在调色板上，然后把猫儿按在上面走动几下子，让猫儿脚掌上沾满了颜色之后，就把它移放在一张准备好的画布上。”讲到这里，其中有一个学生着急地问：“猫儿不跑吗？”院长接着说：“跑不了，用一个铁丝罩子把它罩着就是了。”院长又说：“你们知道吗？猫儿是最爱干净的，它被罩子关着本来很难受，可是脚掌上的粘性颜色使它更难受。因此，猫儿来不及考虑逃跑，只考虑如何把脚掌上的颜色揩掉，揩呀，揩呀，颜色揩干净了，画家所指望的美丽画幅也就成功了。”
    院长接着又补充说：“这里我不想夸耀这个画家的聪明，但我们应该承认一点，这只爱干净的猫儿把脚掌上的颜色揩掉是有意图的，也就是说，它完成了这幅美丽的画，也是有意图的。”这时，院长就瞧着那个没有什么意图作画的女学生说：“你看，猫儿画画都有意图，而你画画却不知道画的是什么，难道你的天才比不上猫儿吗？”那个女学生虽然被责备得有点难为情，但和其他学生一样都笑了，我们也都笑了。我当时偷偷地观察一下学生们的反应，看样子，好像都从这个精彩的故事里满意地得到了些什么！
    一个啤酒杯的设计
    我又被带到工艺美术系工作室。教授很热情而耐心地给我们介绍着他的教学情况，介绍的课程内容，就是一个啤酒杯的设计。在这个课程里，教授规定每个学生要先写一篇洋洋数万言的关于玻璃发展史的考证，和一篇设计施工的论文，然后按着论文所设计的要求做出各种不同材料的模型，其中有粘土、石膏、纸皮和木料总共不下十来种。我们所参观的是这位教授的一位得意门生的个人作业。教授让学生自我介绍，他详尽地告诉了我们他的学习进度和步骤，并特别强调说明这个考证工作的重要性。从他那两篇洋洋数万言的论文和那一大堆设计模型看，充分说明了他对这个课程作业是如何认真，这种钻研精神，原是未可厚非的。至于集中了一个学期的时间和精力，仅为这个杯子作无目的的考证，这种设计施工，却又使我有点怀疑。我为了想知道究竟，于是问了下面这个问题：“你们的教学，是否结合生产？”
    教授坦率地说：“不，生产单位是不会采用的。”
    我紧接着问：“为什么？”
    这时候，学生盯了教授一眼回答说：“据说因为太笨重了，顾客不喜欢它。”
    维纳斯的厄运
    一次，有一位比利时朋友陪我在布鲁塞尔艺术宫看了一次抽象主义的画展，看后，他问我的意见如何？当时来不及修饰词令，我直率地说：“臭的。”不料这位朋友非常赏识我这一个字的评语，他承认西方人士不懂得运用嗅觉来欣赏艺术。这个画展的内容到底怎样呢？他们除了采用油彩之外，还大量在画面出现有旧报纸、破布片、废铜烂铁、邮票、车票、火柴枝、烟屁股，一块抹桌布，甚至安上一个烟斗、或挂上一串钥匙。结果，就成了一个又脏又臭的垃圾堆。有些作品，还荒谬绝伦地标价十多万比利时法郎（合人民币五、六千元）。至于反映在雕塑上又怎样呢？我也想在这里随便举些例子：我见过一件作品是用一条弯曲的铁杆子，架上几条直铁丝，再在上端挂上一个半圆形的小铁环，这个作品的题目叫做“母性”（如左图）；另一个同样用一条两节的铁杆串上两个铁圈子，题目叫做“梦”。还有些堆砌成为一个令人作呕的废料堆，叫做“物质的可能性”和“愁虑的空间”。随便弄几个圈圈，叫做“天使”。另一种好像中国的古老商店门口的幌子，在无数的铁条架子上吊上各种怪形体的废铁片、厚纸板，挂在当风的地方飘荡着叮当作响，这叫做“空间雕塑”，听说这种东西是从美国风行到欧洲来的。
    资产阶级的抽象派就是这样的，把最丑、最脏、最臭的东西认为最“美”。谁都知道维纳斯是希腊神话中美的化身，但是在资产阶级的抽象派画家的眼里，却把它变形成了什么都不是的怪东西，甚至把它描绘成为一个非常可怕的魔鬼（如上图）。这也算得是自由世界艺术创造的杰作吧！
    “试验”
    有一次，在比利时朋友的家里，碰上一位比较年轻的抽象派女画家，她拿了不下十几幅近作来征求我的意见。我一点也看不懂，要我提意见，使我感到很为难。没办法，只好争取主动，让她自己先讲讲，于是我随便抽了一幅画问她：“这画的内容是什么？其中想表达什么意思？”她直率地说：“没有什么内容，也没有什么意思，只是一个‘试验’。”我接着问：“那么你试验的目的是什么？意图怎样？”她和前面说的那个美术学院里的女学生一样，她声明说：“我没有什么意图，只是碰着看看，碰出什么样，就是什么样。”她为了更加使我了解她的制作过程，便指着一幅画上那些光怪陆离、无奇不有的颜色很得意地告诉我碰的方法和步骤。她说：“首先在画布上随便放上第一种什么颜色，比方这幅，我本能地把金的颜色先涂上去，然后随便把黑的、红的、白的、绿的……各种各样的颜色逐步凑上去，碰呀！涂呀！涂呀，碰呀！往往会碰出你意想不到的效果。”她跟着又补充了一句说：“假定先有了意图，就不会达到这个美妙的意境。”大概她认为这是一幅最得意的佳作，有时平放着看看，有时竖起来看看，最后又把它悬挂起来，总希望找一个光线最合适的角度好让客人欣赏。她从我的态度上找不到任何反应，有点焦急起来，因而，又进一步补充说着：“请你细心地看，画里有音乐，越看越神妙，你找着了吧？想你一定会从中发现很多东西的……。”
    物腐则虫生
    这里，也许有人会提出疑问，为什么抽象派绘画在西方国家会得到滋长，而且能够泛滥？这无疑是资本主义社会的畸形发展，是一种病态。一般观众是真的喜欢抽象派绘画吗？根据了解，不但不喜欢，甚至不少人对它很反感。但是，因为这个流派，被一些人认为是绘画发展中一个新兴的东西，是时髦的事物，因而有些人为了表示自己有文化，有修养，故意装成“行家”，大事欣赏。如果说不懂吧，就会感到失掉了身份，他们明知受了骗，但又要骗别人，不懂装懂，自欺欺人，正像安徒生童话里皇帝的新衣的故事一样。比方我在安特卫普曾问及一个比利时朋友对抽象派的看法怎样？他说：“很好，画里有音乐……”其实他一窍不通，当我进一步问音乐体现在什么地方？他就哑口无言以对了。
    资产阶级画家还经常夸耀他们“为艺术而艺术”的清高，想画什么就画什么的创作自由。其实，他们之所谓“自由”，只有为他们的主顾服务的自由。主顾是谁呢？一个是资产阶级的画商，画家的命运就掌握在他们的手里。反正作品没有什么好坏标准，只要合乎画商老板的要求，就会得到青睐。而他们的目的，是要垄断画坛市场，从中获得暴利。另一个是反动的政府机关，它通过美帝国主义控制下的联合国教育、科学及文化组织这个机构邀请画家在各会员国展览，同时各会员国之间又互相推荐展出。因此，谁要想被邀请，谁要想被推荐，谁要想得到画商的青睐，就得出卖自己的灵魂，把脖子伸进圈套里，服服贴贴地为他们服务。所谓“自由”，所谓“清高”，只是彻头彻尾的骗人的鬼话，胡扯的谎言。
    我想起毛主席说过“资本主义社会一天天烂下去”这句很形象的话。自然，一个社会制度烂下去必然是包括它的政治、经济、文化等等的。文化艺术是经济基础的上层建筑，基础烂了，上层建筑岂有不烂下去之理？这里又使我联想起“物腐则虫生”这句成语，凡腐烂的臭东西，总会长出虫来，细菌也总是在适应它滋长的气温土壤环境里繁殖起来的。不是吗，连烂麻布也上画了（如上图）。
