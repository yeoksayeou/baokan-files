Xinhua News Agency, Rostock, June 27th: The "Baltic Sea Peace Week" opened this afternoon in the northern German Democratic Republic (GDR) seaport city of Rostock.

　　More than 50,000 guests from countries along the Baltic Sea and other European countries are participating in the Peace Week, including a Soviet government delegation led by Soviet Minister of Merchant Marine, Bakayev, a Polish government delegation led by Polish Minister of Transport, Szylitzer, Finnish Deputy Speaker of Parliament Paavo Aitio, and Finnish Minister of Finance, Viljam Sarola. On the eve of Peace Week, the All-China Youth Federation sent a telegram to the Free German Youth League, congratulating them on the holding of Peace Week.

　　Walter Ubricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Deputy Prime Minister of the GDR, delivered the opening speech, saying: "We hope that this meeting will become a friendly gathering and a peace festival among the people of the Baltic Sea region, Norway and Iceland. It is hoped that this conference expresses our common desire to make the Baltic Sea a sea of peace." He expressed the hope that this meeting would help expand private and official contacts, trade and cultural exchanges between Baltic Sea countries.

　　Ulbricht said that the GDR had proposed to turn the Baltic Sea into a sea of peace. The first step towards this goal is to make the Baltic Sea a region free of atomic and rocket weapons. The GDR also fully supports the Rapacki Plan and Comrade Khrushchev's speech in Riga.

　　Ulbricht said, however, that there is one country with a coastline on the Baltic Sea – West Germany – which has overt plans for aggression. German militarists are attempting to launch new aggression against Northern Europe based on NATO bases. Ulbricht then emphasized: "However, judging from the current balance of power, a military offensive against the socialist camp would be a suicidal act for Bonn."

　　Ulbricht pointed out that the Scandinavian countries must now choose between the following: either to make the Baltic Sea a battlefield for NATO, or to make it a sea of peace. The GDR is willing to reiterate the proposal it made in September 1957 to the Baltic Sea countries and Norway: all these countries should conclude bilateral or multilateral treaties of non-aggression, cultural and trade cooperation agreements, and declare their determination to safeguard and strengthen peace in the Baltic Sea.

　　He said that the GDR has made sincere efforts to develop good-neighborly relations with its neighbors, especially with countries along the Baltic Sea.

　　Ulbricht also emphasized the importance of concluding a peace treaty with Germany. He said that concluding a peace treaty with Germany would finally end World War II, while at the same time stopping West German militarism. He said that this would also contribute to improving international relations in the whole of Europe, including the Baltic Sea region, so now is the time for the Baltic Sea countries and peoples to take an independent and peaceful stance. This will also help further discussions at the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference and summit meetings.

　　The head of the Soviet government delegation, Bakayev, also spoke at the meeting.

　　It is reported that this "Baltic Sea Peace Week" will end on July 5. During this period, various international gatherings will be held in the Rostock District, such as seminars for workers, women and university students. There will also be many cultural and sports activities.

　　In addition, during the Peace Week, the Second Workers' Conference of the Baltic Sea countries and Norway will be held in Rostock from June 29 to 30. About 300 workers and trade union members will participate in this conference. The central issue discussed at this conference is: "The tasks of the working class and trade union organizations in the struggle to safeguard peace in the Baltic Sea region."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Rostock, June 27th: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, emphasized at a press conference held in Rostock tonight that the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between the Baltic Sea countries is beneficial to the people of all countries, and only unfavorable to West German militarists and revanchist elements.

　　Ulbricht said that if the Scandinavian countries do not establish atomic missile bases, then this is in their interest, and the realization of a nuclear-free missile zone will be a failure for Bonn's plans for aggressive war.

　　Ulbricht expressed confidence that "Baltic Sea Peace Week" will help the mutual understanding of the people of all countries and help ease tensions. He said that the people of all countries participating in Peace Week should oppose the West German militarist policy and help turn the Baltic Sea into a true sea of peace.

　　When talking about developing relations between the GDR and the Scandinavian countries, Ulbricht said that the GDR's seven-year plan will double the trade volume between the GDR and these countries. He said that the GDR is willing to cooperate in a friendly manner with all countries that desire peace.

　　Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Matern, Deputy Prime Minister of the GDR, Sefrin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wenzel, and others answered questions about the GDR's political system at the press conference.

    乌布利希在“波罗的海和平周”开幕式上说
    各国人民要求波罗的海成为和平之海
    并指出波罗的海各国缔结互不侵犯协定对各国人民有利
    新华社罗斯托克27日电　“波罗的海和平周”今天下午在德意志民主共和国北部海港罗斯托克城开幕。
    参加和平周的有五万多名来自波罗的海沿岸各国和欧洲其他国家的客人，其中包括以苏联海运部长巴卡耶夫为首的苏联政府代表团，以波兰交通部长斯柴莱茨基为首的波兰政府代表团，芬兰议会副议长帕沃·埃蒂奥、芬兰财政部长威廉·萨里奥拉等。在和平周前夕，中华全国青年联合会曾致电自由德国青年联盟，祝贺和平周的举行。
    德国统一社会党中央第一书记、德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希致开幕词说：“我们希望这次会议成为波罗的海地区、挪威和冰岛人民之间友好的会议和一个和平节日。希望这次会议表达我们要使波罗的海成为和平之海的共同愿望。”他希望，这次会议将有助于扩大波罗的海国家之间的私人和官方的接触，扩大贸易和文化交流。
    乌布利希说，德意志民主共和国曾经倡议把波罗的海变为和平之海。走向这个目标的第一步是使波罗的海成为一个没有原子和火箭武器的地区。德意志民主共和国还完全支持腊帕茨基计划和赫鲁晓夫同志在里加所发表的讲话。
    乌布利希说，但是有一个在波罗的海拥有海岸线的国家——西德，却有公开的侵略计划。德国军国主义者企图依据北大西洋公约组织的基地，对北欧发动新的侵略。乌布利希接着强调说：“但是，从目前的力量对比看来，对社会主义阵营发动军事进攻将是波恩的一个自杀行动。”
    乌布利希指出，斯堪的纳维亚半岛国家现在必须在下列两者之间作出抉择：或是使波罗的海成为北大西洋公约组织的战场，或是使它成为和平之海。德意志民主共和国愿意重申它在1957年9月向波罗的海国家和挪威提出的建议：所有这些国家缔结双边或多边的互不侵犯条约、文化和贸易合作协定以及宣布它们决心维护和加强波罗的海和平。
    他说，德意志民主共和国已作出真诚的努力来同它的邻国，特别是同波罗的海沿岸的国家发展睦邻关系。
    乌布利希还强调指出缔结对德和约的重要性。他说，缔结对德和约将最后结束第二次世界大战，同时制止西德军国主义。他说，这也将对改进包括波罗的海地区在内的整个欧洲的国际关系作出贡献，因此现在已经是波罗的海国家和人民采取独立的和平的立场的时候了。这也将有助于东西方外长会议的进一步会谈和最高级会议的会谈。
    苏联政府代表团团长巴卡耶夫也在会上讲了话。
    据悉，这次“波罗的海和平周”将在7月5日结束。在这期间，将在罗斯托克专区举行各种国际性的集会，如工人、妇女和大学生的座谈会，还将举行许多文艺、体育活动。
    此外，在和平周期间，还将于6月29日到30日在罗斯托克举行波罗的海国家和挪威的第二届工人会议。约有三百名工人和工会会员参加这次会议。这次会议讨论的中心问题是：“工人阶级和工会组织在为保障波罗的海地区和平而斗争中的任务”。
    新华社罗斯托克27日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希今晚在罗斯托克城举行的记者招待会上强调说，波罗的海各国缔结一项互不侵犯协定对于各国人民是有利的，只是不利于西德军国主义和复仇主义分子。
    乌布利希说，如果斯堪的纳维亚各国不设立原子导弹基地，那么，这是符合它们的利益的，实现无原子导弹武器区将是波恩的侵略战争计划的失败。
    乌布利希表示确信，“波罗的海和平周”有助于各国人民的互相了解，有助于缓和紧张局势。他说，参加和平周的各国人民应当反对西德军国主义政策，帮助把波罗的海变为真正的和平之海。
    在谈到发展德意志民主共和国和斯堪的纳维亚的各国关系时，乌布利希说，德意志民主共和国的七年计划会把德意志民主共和国和这些国家的贸易额增加一倍。他说，德意志民主共和国愿意同一切要求和平的国家友好合作。
    德国统一社会党中央政治局委员马特恩、德意志民主共和国副总理赛弗林、外交部副部长文策尔等，在记者招待会上回答了有关德意志民主共和国政治制度等方面的问题。
