    Displaying the Soaring Enthusiasm of Communist Builders
    Soviet Economic Achievement Exhibition Opens Today
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 15th. The long-awaited Soviet National Economic Achievement Exhibition is scheduled to officially open at 5:00 PM on the 16th. The exhibition will display over 100,000 large-scale exhibits. This was announced by Bogdanov, Director-General of the Exhibition, at a press conference held here today.

    Bogdanov pointed out that the scale of the Soviet National Economic Achievement Exhibition is so large that, according to calculations, if one spent five minutes viewing each exhibit, it would take more than a year to see all the exhibits in the exhibition.

    Maksarev, Chairman of the State Science and Technology Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, also spoke at the press conference. He said that the Soviet National Economic Achievement Exhibition was expanded on the basis of the previous three exhibitions of Soviet industry, agriculture, and construction. The exhibition includes a total of seventy-one pavilions, covering an area of more than 200 hectares. Among them, the industrial section includes eighteen pavilions such as "Machine Building," "Soviet Electrification," and "Chemical Industry." The agricultural section has more than twenty pavilions. In addition, the exhibition also has pavilions such as "Higher Education," "Books," and "Toys."

    Maksarev said that the Soviet National Economic Achievement Exhibition brings together the latest scientific and technological achievements from all over the Soviet Union. The exhibition also fully demonstrates the soaring enthusiasm of the Soviet people to complete the Seven-Year Plan during the period of comprehensively unfolding communist construction.

    显示共产主义建设者的高涨热情
    苏联经济成就展览会今日开幕
    新华社莫斯科15日电　筹备已久的苏联国民经济成就展览会定于16日下午五时正式开幕。展览会展出的大型展览品在十万件以上。这是展览会总干事鲍格达诺夫今天在此间举行的记者招待会上宣布的。
    鲍格达诺夫指出，苏联国民经济成就展览会的规模如此之大，据计算，如果参观每一件展览品用五分钟，那么，要看完展览会的全部展览品就得一年以上的时间。
    苏联部长会议国家科学技术委员会主席马克萨烈夫在记者招待会上也讲了话。他说，苏联国民经济成就展览会是在以前的苏联工业、农业和建筑业等三个展览会的基础上扩建而成的。这次展览会总共包括七十一个展览馆，占地两百多公顷。其中，工业方面包括“机器制造”、“苏联电气化”、“化学工业”等十八个馆。农业方面共有二十多个展览馆。此外，展览会还有“高等教育”、“书籍”、“玩具”等展览馆。
    马克萨烈夫说，苏联国民经济成就展览会汇集了全苏联最新的科学生产技术成就。展览会也充分地显示着在全面展开共产主义建设时期苏联人民争取完成七年计划的高涨热情。
