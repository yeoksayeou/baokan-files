    Developing Passenger-Freight Joint Transportation in Jiangsu
    Zhang Shouguan
    Jiangsu Province is a region with a dense water network, a large population, and developed industry. Its material exchanges cover the entire country, and the proportion of imports and exports is also very high. In accordance with the needs of this objective situation, Jiangsu Province has gradually opened joint transportation businesses within and outside the province since liberation, adopting a variety of joint transportation methods. In terms of freight joint transportation, there are cargo ship route and cargo route joint transportation, cargo ship route and passenger route joint transportation, passenger ship route with attached freight joint transportation, ship and truck joint transportation, ship and wooden sailing boat joint transportation, river-sea joint transportation, river-sea-railway joint transportation, inland river and Yangtze River joint transportation, inland river and railway joint transportation, etc. The total joint transportation mileage reaches more than 40,000 kilometers, and the proportion of joint transportation volume accounts for 40% of the total transportation volume. The main joint transportation materials include coal, iron, copper, hardware, machinery, cotton, tobacco leaves, chemical fertilizers, grain, ore, cotton cloth, salt, pottery, handicrafts, and local specialties, which has played a positive role in promoting economic construction. In terms of passenger joint transportation, Jiangsu Province handles joint transportation between various water transportation trunk lines, as well as between ships and automobiles, trains, ferries, tricycles, and urban public buses. The joint transportation methods include one-ticket-to-the-end system, ticket transfer joint transportation system, two-ticket joint transportation system, baggage transfer joint transportation system, entrusting river ships to sell passenger tickets joint transportation system, seasonal joint transportation, and a system that also handles joint transportation passenger food and accommodation supply procedures, etc. The joint transportation mileage is more than 6,000 kilometers. Because the passenger-freight joint transportation procedures are simple, saving time and money, both passengers and cargo owners are very satisfied.
    Not only that, but opening joint transportation can also promote cooperation between transportation units and between transportation units and material units; through joint transportation, the quality of planned transportation can be further improved; through joint transportation, scattered local specialties in remote mountainous areas can be collected and transported to major Jianghai ports. These advantages are difficult to achieve with general transportation.
    In promoting joint transportation business, Jiangsu Province has firmly grasped the spirit of "serving passengers and freight, and doing a good job in communist cooperation" and the principles of "more, faster, better, and more economical," as well as the methods of "from simple to complex," "from point to surface," "from city to countryside," "from export to import," "from trunk line to branch line," and "from few varieties to many varieties," thus enabling the joint transportation business to develop smoothly. Recently, Jiangsu Province has also begun to formulate a plan to further develop the joint transportation network; increase joint transportation transshipment points and joint transportation transshipment volume; develop not only one-ticket-to-the-end, freight rate progressively decreasing, one-time fee joint transportation forms, but also joint transportation service forms of agency receiving, agency transportation, agency transfer, and agency delivery; attach importance to both inter-provincial joint transportation and intra-provincial joint transportation; strengthen not only trunk line joint transportation, but also rural and mountainous joint transportation; ensure not only key materials, but also take care of the collection and transportation of local specialties. After the implementation of this plan, it will further comprehensively connect the seaports of the North and South Oceans, the ports of the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the railway lines across the country with Jiangsu Province's inland rivers and highways, so that materials mutually transferred inside and outside the province can be transported from mines, factories, people's communes, and even residents' homes to the receiving units or consignees through different joint transportation methods. In this way, in addition to better serving passengers and freight and meeting the requirements of industrial and agricultural production, it will further strengthen cooperation and overall arrangement between regions and transportation tools, so that advanced transportation tools and backward transportation tools can be included in a complete transportation plan to form a whole.

    发展中的江苏客货联运
    张寿官
    江苏省是一个水网地区，人口众多，工业发达，物资交流面遍及全国，对外输出输入比重也很大。根据这种客观形势的需要，江苏省在解放以后逐步开办了省境以内和省境以外的联运业务，采取了多种联运方式。在货物联运方面，有轮船货班与货班联运，轮船货班与客班联运，轮船客班与客班附货联运，轮船汽车联运，轮船木帆船联运，河海联运，河海铁路联运，内河长江联运，内河铁路联运等，联运里程共达四万多公里，联运量比重占总运量的40％。主要联运物资有煤、铁、铜、五金、机器、棉花、烟叶、化肥、粮食、矿石、棉布、盐、陶器、手工艺品以及土特产等，这对经济建设的发展起了积极的促进作用。在旅客联运方面，江苏省各水运干线之间以及轮船与汽车、火车、轮渡、三轮车、市内公共汽车之间都办理了联运。联运的方式有一票到底制，换票联运制，两票联运制，行包中转联运制，委托江轮代售客票联运制、季节性联运，以及兼理联运旅客食宿供应手续制等，联运里程有六千多公里。由于客货联运手续简便，省事省费，旅客和货主都感到非常满意。
    不仅如此，开办联运，还可促进运输单位同运输单位之间的协作和运输单位与物资单位之间的协作；通过联运，把计划运输的质量更提高一步；通过联运，能够把边远山区的零星土特产集运到江海主要港口。这些优点，是一般运输难以达到的。
    江苏省在推广联运业务之中，紧紧抓住了“为客货服务，搞好共产主义大协作”的精神和“多、快、好、省”的原则，以及“由简到繁”，“由点到面”，“由城市到乡村”，“由出口到进口”“由干线到支线”，“由少品种到多品种”的方法，因而使联运业务得到顺利发展。最近，江苏省还着手拟订进一步发展联运网的规划；增加联运换装点和联运换装量；既发展一票到底、运价递远递减、一次收费的联运形式，也发展代接、代运、代转、代送的联运服务形式；既重视省际联运，也重视省内联运；既增强干线联运，更增强农村与山区的联运；既保证重点物资，也照顾土特产的集运。实现这一规划以后，将进一步把南北洋各海港、长江上、中、下游各口岸，以及全国各铁路线与江苏省的内河与公路全面联运起来，使省内外互调物资，都可以通过不同的联运方式从矿山、工厂、人民公社，甚至居民的家里运送到收货单位或收货人手里。这样，除了能更好地为客货服务，满足工农业生产的要求以外，并将进一步加强地区之间，运输工具之间的协作和全面安排，使先进运输工具与落后运输工具纳入一个完整的运输计划之内，形成一个整体。
