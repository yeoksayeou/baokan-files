Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th: Commercial departments in Guangxi are implementing the policy of serving production and actively assisting industrial departments in the production of daily-use industrial products. From January to May this year, the autonomous region's commercial departments' purchase volume of daily-use industrial products increased by more than 131% compared to the same period last year.

After summing up their experiences last year, the broad masses of employees in commercial departments throughout the autonomous region have more clearly recognized that commercial work must be oriented towards production and serve production. They have adopted various measures to assist production units in doing a good job in production. Commercial departments send resident factory staff to factories to understand production conditions, and, according to market needs, promptly assist factories in arranging production plans and overcoming difficulties in raw materials, equipment, and other aspects. Commercial employees have adopted methods such as vigorously purchasing, utilizing substitutes, organizing collaboration, and clearing inventory materials to increase raw material sources for factories. Commercial employees in Nanning, Wuzhou, and other cities actively purchase timber, hardened oil, tallow, wild fibers, etc., to supply match, soap, and other factories; and through methods such as purchasing from other places and mutual adjustments, they help textile and knitting factories solve problems with machinery equipment and spare parts. The Yulin Chemical Factory had liquid oil but lacked hardened oil, while the Nanning Chemical Factory No. 2 had a large inventory of hardened oil but lacked liquid oil. The commercial department helped them to adjust mutually, enabling both factories to produce normally.

In order to help factories producing daily necessities increase product varieties and improve product quality, commercial departments actively collect opinions from the people and reflect them to the factories; at the same time, they use methods such as organizing observation and holding sample exhibitions to help factories improve their technical level. For example, employees of the Nanning Department Store Wholesale Station organized a work team to conduct surveys and interviews among the people in the city to solicit consumers' opinions on local industrial products; at the same time, they organized manpower to study production technology in other places and collect samples of advanced products for factories to learn and imitate. Now, more than 1,000 new varieties have been added to the city, and the styles of leather shoes and suitcases have also been greatly improved. The leather shoe production cooperative in Hechi County originally produced purple and green sandals, but because the styles were poor and there was no shoe polish of this color, sales were difficult; the county commercial bureau suggested that they produce yellow and black leather shoes and improve the styles, which resulted in best-selling goods.

    广西商业部门多方寻找原料
    大力协助工厂增产日用百货
    新华社南宁16日电　广西商业部门贯彻为生产服务的方针，积极协助工业部门生产日用工业品。今年1月到5月，自治区商业部门日用工业品的收购量已比去年同期增加了131％以上。
    自治区各地商业部门在总结了去年的经验以后，广大职工更加明确地认识到商业工作必须面向生产，为生产服务。他们采取各种措施来协助生产单位搞好生产。商业部门派出驻厂员到工厂了解生产情况，根据市场需要，及时协助各厂安排生产计划和克服原料、设备等方面的一些困难。商业职工采取了大力收购、利用代用品、组织协作、清理库存物资等办法，为工厂增加原料来源。南宁、梧州等市商业职工积极采购木材、硬化油、牛油、野生纤维等，供给火柴、肥皂等工厂；又通过到外地采购、互相调剂等方法，帮助纺织厂和针织厂解决机器设备和零件材料等问题。玉林化工厂有液体油但缺少硬化油，而南宁化工二厂硬化油库存较多却缺乏液体油。商业部门便帮助他们互相调剂，使两个厂都能正常生产。
    为了帮助生产日用品的工厂增加产品品种，提高产品质量，商业部门一方面积极收集人民群众的意见，反映给工厂；一方面用组织观摩、举办样品展览会等方式，帮助工厂提高技术水平。如南宁百货批发站职工组织工作队，在本市人民群众中调查访问，征求消费者对本地工业产品的意见；同时组织人力到外地学习生产技术，代为搜集先进产品的样品，供工厂学习仿制。现在全市已增加了一千多种新品种，皮鞋、皮箱的式样也大有改进。河池县皮鞋生产社原来生产的紫色、绿色凉鞋，因为式样较差，又没有这种颜色的鞋油，因此销售困难；县商业局就建议他们生产黄色与黑色皮鞋，改进规格式样，结果成了畅销货。（附图片）
