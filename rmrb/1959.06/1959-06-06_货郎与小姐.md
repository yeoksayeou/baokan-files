Following the Beijing People's Art Theater and the Central Academy of Drama's Experimental Drama Theater's performances of the comedies "The Miser" and "The Servant of Two Masters," the Central Experimental Opera Theater, starting from May 30th, premiered the comic opera "The Peddler and the Maiden" by the famous Soviet Azerbaijani writer and composer Uzeir Hajibeyov in Beijing.

This play depicts a dispute arising from the pursuit of free marriage in the feudal society of the 19th century. Under the author's skillful pen, the eight characters who appear in the play form four couples in a dramatic fashion. The "opponents" of free marriage also freely married the objects of their affections in the end. The sharp satire and humorous dialogues in the script evoked bursts of lighthearted laughter from the audience.

During this rehearsal, the Central Experimental Opera Theater received enthusiastic care and assistance from the Soviet Ministry of Culture and the Moscow Musical Theater. The Moscow Musical Theater sent the complete musical score of the play. (Attached pictures)

    “货郎与小姐”
    继北京人民艺术剧院、中央戏剧学院实验话剧院演出喜剧“悭吝人”“一仆二主”之后，中央实验歌剧院从5月30日起，在北京第一次公演了苏联阿塞拜疆著名作家、作曲家乌杰尔·加吉别科夫的喜歌剧“货郎与小姐”。
    这个剧描写了在十九世纪的封建社会里，为了争取自由婚姻而产生的一场纷争。在作者巧妙的笔下，全剧总共出场的八个人，前后戏剧性地结成了四对夫妇。自由婚姻的“反对者”最后也自由地同自己倾心的对象结了婚。剧本中辛辣的讽刺、幽默的对白，激起了观众一阵阵轻松的笑声。
    中央实验歌剧院在这次排练时得到了苏联文化部和莫斯科音乐剧院的热情关怀和协助，莫斯科音乐剧院寄来了这个剧的全部音乐总谱。（附图片）
