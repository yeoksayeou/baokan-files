Xinhua News Agency, June 5th -- The No. 3 blast furnace and No. 3 coke oven, expanded at the Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company, were completed in May of this year and put into production on the 22nd and 23rd, respectively. Another newly constructed project, the sintering plant, is also nearing completion and will soon be put into production.

These three major projects are the first batch of key expansion projects for the Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company. Once these projects are put into production, they will greatly increase the company's existing production capacity of pig iron, coke, and sintered ore. This marks the first step of this small steel plant with a history of forty years towards the goal of becoming a modern integrated iron and steel enterprise.

The No. 3 blast furnace, No. 3 coke oven, and the sintering plant all have modern technical equipment. The No. 3 blast furnace is equipped with a high-pressure furnace top, steam blast, and automatic control equipment. The entire production process, from charging to tapping, is mechanized. In addition, radioactive isotope uranium is placed in the bricklaying at the bottom of the furnace to detect the erosion of the furnace bottom by molten iron. The No. 3 coke oven adopts a new type of furnace and various latest machinery. The sintering plant is entirely operated by electric interlocking devices, and its production process is also mechanized.

These three relatively large projects with advanced technology, from surveying and design to construction, were completed by Chinese workers under the guidance of Soviet experts, overcoming many difficulties. Most of the equipment was also manufactured domestically. The engineering quality of the No. 3 blast furnace and No. 3 coke oven is good. Trial production over the past half month has proven that the equipment and production are basically normal. The production workers quickly became familiar with the operation of the new equipment and expressed satisfaction with the engineering quality.

It took only seventeen months from the decision to build the No. 3 blast furnace and No. 3 coke oven to their completion. The construction speed was relatively fast. In order to ensure the early completion and commissioning of the three major projects with good construction quality, the Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company, under the leadership of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, boldly mobilized the masses and adopted a series of measures to overcome various difficulties.

During the construction of the three major projects, it received support from all parts of the country. More than 300 factories across the country rushed to manufacture various equipment for it, and many factories in Beijing also participated in manufacturing equipment for it. Inspired by the development situation of the capital's metallurgical industry, cadres from many agencies in the capital, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, university and secondary school students, and members of the people's communes have successively participated in voluntary labor at the company for 330,000 workdays.

    钢铁战线又添新力量
    石钢大高炉大焦炉点火
    据新华社5日讯　石景山钢铁公司扩建的三号高炉和三号焦炉，已在今年5月建成，并分别在22日和23日投入生产。另一新建工程——烧结厂也即将建成投入生产。
    这三大工程是石景山钢铁公司扩建的第一批重点工程。这些工程投入生产以后，将使这个公司现有的生铁、炼焦和烧结矿的生产能力增长很多。这样就使这个有四十年历史的小型钢铁厂向现代化钢铁联合企业的目标迈出了第一步。
    三号高炉、三号焦炉和烧结厂，都具有现代化的技术装备。三号高炉装有高压炉顶、蒸汽鼓风和自动控制设备，从装料到出铁的整个生产过程都是机械化的。除此之外，还在炉底砌砖中放置了放射性同位素铀，用来探测炉底被铁水浸蚀的情况。三号焦炉采用了新式的炉型和各种最新的机械，烧结厂全部由电动联锁装置进行操作，它们的生产过程也都是机械化的。
    这三个具有先进技术的规模较大的工程，从勘察、设计到施工，是在苏联专家的指导下，由我国职工克服了许多困难完成的；绝大部分设备也是国内制造的。三号高炉和三号焦炉的工程质量良好。经过半个月来的试生产证明，设备和生产情况都基本正常；生产工人很快熟悉了新设备的操作，对工程质量表示满意。
    三号高炉和三号焦炉，从决定建设到建成，一共只用了十七个月。建设的速度是比较快的。石景山钢铁公司为了使三大工程在确保建设质量良好的条件下早日建成和投入生产，在冶金部和中共北京市委的领导下，放手发动群众，采取一系列措施，千方百计克服了各种困难。
    三大工程在建设过程中，曾得到全国各方面的支援，全国有三百多个工厂为它赶制各种设备，北京市的许多工厂也参加了为它制造设备的活动。首都许多机关的干部、解放军官兵、大中学校学生和人民公社的社员，为首都冶金工业的发展形势所鼓舞，曾先后在这个公司义务劳动了三十三万个工作日。（附图片）
