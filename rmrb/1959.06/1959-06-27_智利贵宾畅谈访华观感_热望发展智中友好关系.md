Xinhua News Agency, June 26th - Five Chilean political figures currently visiting China: Professor Ortega and his wife, Professor Alvarez and his wife, and Professor Ramírez, today spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters about their impressions of visiting China.

The five distinguished Chilean guests arrived in Beijing on May 10th at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. They visited Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang, Fushun, and Anshan. When reporters interviewed them at the Beijing Hotel today, the distinguished guests expressed their best wishes to the Chinese people and eagerly hoped to develop friendly relations between Chile and China.

Professor Ortega, Chairman of the Chilean Radical Party and member of the National Committee of the Popular Action Front, and former Minister of Education of Chile, excitedly told reporters: "The most effective way to strengthen the friendship between Chile and China is to strengthen our two countries' cultural exchanges. Economic ties are also beneficial. This will strengthen the understanding and mutual support between the Chilean people and the Chinese people."

Professor Ortega said, "The Chinese people and Chinese leaders have a sincere desire to safeguard world peace and enhance friendship with the people of all countries. The democratic forces in Chile also hold the same feelings. Bringing the Chinese people's friendly sentiments to the Chilean people will be a very pleasant obligation."

Talking about his impressions of visiting China, Professor Ortega said: "Although our time in China has only been a few weeks, we are very happy and moved. We have seen that China has done a lot in terms of people's welfare and developing production in just ten short years. It is not difficult to understand that the people are satisfied and are advancing along the road of progress under the leadership of their talented leaders."

Mrs. Ortega, Chairman of the Women's Committee of the Chilean Popular Action Front, said, "During my journey in China, I deeply felt the support and love of the Chinese people for the Chilean people, which deeply moved me. The women of New China are shouldering the responsibility of building the motherland." "As a woman, I feel happy, and I can prove that social progress and social justice have been realized in this part of the world. This is also the wish of the Chilean people. I have gained confidence from here."

Professor Alvarez, member of the Central Committee of the Chilean Socialist Party and Chairman of the National Disciplinary Committee, and former Deputy Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, said: "What interested me most during my visit to China was the tremendous construction being carried out by the Chinese people, and learning about the tremendous changes that have taken place in industry and agriculture since China's liberation." He said that the impression he got in China was that all the large-scale construction being carried out in China was for peace.

Professor Alvarez said, "In China, I not only saw construction projects, but also the spiritual foundation of China's construction, which is China's education. In China, education has opened its doors to workers and farmers, who not only enter primary and secondary schools, but also universities."

Talking about developing economic ties and cultural exchanges between Chile and China, Professor Alvarez said: "Despite the embargo and blockade by U.S. imperialism, there is still great potential for the development of trade between Chile and China. As for cultural exchanges, that is something that U.S. imperialism cannot prohibit. People's thoughts, even across the ocean, must be exchanged, and embargoes cannot prohibit it." He said, "Chinese artists have been very successful in their performances in Chile, and Chilean artists will always come to China for visits and performances in the future."

Mrs. Alvarez said: "I deeply admire the enthusiasm of Chinese women for socialist construction. Chinese children are well taken care of and are growing up healthily."

Mrs. Alvarez said, "There is great potential for the development of cultural relations between Chile and China. We saw an exhibition of Chilean women's paintings and crafts in China. After we return to Chile, we will do a lot of work to promote the development of cultural exchanges between our two countries."

Professor Ramírez, head of the Chilean Socialist Party in Concepción and former mayor of Concepción, said: "Western propaganda machines attack China for eliminating individuality and freedom, and for destroying families. I believe that the reality of life in China is the best answer to this attack. We have seen in China that individuality is developed, freedom is respected, and family life is harmonious."

Professor Ramírez said: "Our visit will promote friendly exchanges between China and Chile. We are witnesses to the real life in China, and we will promote the Chilean people's understanding of China after we return."

    智利贵宾畅谈访华观感
    热望发展智中友好关系
    新华社26日讯　正在我国访问的五位智利政界人士：奥特加教授和他的夫人，阿尔瓦莱斯教授和他的夫人以及拉米莱斯教授，今天分别向本社记者畅谈他们访问中国的印象。
    五位智利贵宾应中国人民外交学会的邀请，于5月10日到达北京，他们访问了北京、上海、南京、杭州、武汉、沈阳、抚顺和鞍山等地。今天记者在北京饭店分别访问他们的时候，贵宾们向中国人民表达良好祝愿，热望发展智利和中国的友好关系。
    奥特加教授是智利激进主义党主席、人民行动阵线全国委员会委员，曾担任智利教育部部长。他兴奋地告诉记者说：“加强智利和中国友谊的最有效办法就是要加强我们两国的文化交流。经济联系也是有好处的。这样就会加强智利人民和中国人民的了解和相互支援”。
    奥特加教授说，“中国人民和中国领导者们有着维护世界和平事业和增进同各国人民友谊的真诚愿望。智利民主力量也抱有同样的心情。把中国人民的友好情意带给智利人民，这将是一件十分令人愉快的义务”。
    谈到访问中国的印象时，奥特加教授说：“虽然在中国的时间只是几个星期，但是我们很愉快，很受感动。我们看到中国在短短的十年中，已经在人民福利和发展生产方面做了不少的事情。不难了解，人民是满意的，人民正在自己的有才能的领导者们的领导下沿着进步的道路前进”。
    智利人民行动阵线妇女委员会主席奥特加夫人说，“在中国的旅途上，我深深感到中国人民对智利人民的支援和热爱，这使我深受感动”“新中国的妇女承担着建设祖国的责任”，“做为一个妇女，我感到幸福，我可以证明，社会的进步和社会的正义在世界的这个地方实现了。这一点也是智利人民的心愿。我从这里得到了信心”。
    智利社会党中央委员和全国纪律委员会主席、社会党前副总书记阿尔瓦莱斯教授说：“访问中国最使我感到兴趣的是中国人民进行的巨大建设，知道了中国解放后在工业、农业方面所起的巨大变化。”他说在中国得到的印象是：中国进行的一切大规模建设都是为了和平的。
    阿尔瓦莱斯教授说，“我在中国不仅看到建筑工程，也看到中国建设的精神基地，那就是中国的教育。在中国教育已经为工人、农民开放了门户，他们不仅进中小学校，也进了高等学校”。
    谈到发展智利和中国的经济往来和文化交流时，阿尔瓦莱斯教授说：“尽管有美帝国主义的禁运和封锁，智利和中国的贸易还是有很大发展可能的。至于文化交流，那更是美帝国主义不能禁止的。人们的思想即使远隔重洋也是要交换，禁运是不能禁止的”。他说，“中国艺术家在智利的演出很成功，将来智利艺术家也总会来中国进行访问演出。”
    阿尔瓦莱斯夫人说：“中国妇女为社会主义建设的劳动热情使我非常欣佩。中国孩子们得到了很好的照顾，长得很健康”。
    阿尔瓦莱斯夫人说，“发展智利和中国的文化关系存在很大的可能。我们在中国看到展出了智利妇女的绘画和工艺品，我们回智利后将要做许多工作，促进我们两国文化交流的发展。”
    智利社会党公塞普森市负责人、前公塞普森市市长拉米莱斯教授说：“西方宣传机器攻击中国消灭个性和自由，破坏家庭。我认为中国的现实生活就是对这种攻击的最好回答。我们在中国看到个性得到发展，自由得到尊重，家庭生活也是和睦的”。
    拉米莱斯教授说：“我们这次来访将促进智中两国的友好往来。我们是中国真实生活的见证人，我们回去后将促进智利人民对中国的了解”。
