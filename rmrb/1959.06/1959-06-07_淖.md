The Mongols call lakes "Nuur." On the grassland, a Nuur is like a jewel on a green carpet.

　　For example, Anguli Nuur is truly a beautiful poem.

　　This Nuur is very, very large. Riding a horse around it would take two full days. Walking or gazing at the edge of the Nuur is like being at the seaside.

　　There are many folk legends about Anguli Nuur. One of them says that there are two golden foals in this Nuur. In times of peace and prosperity, they often come out at night and roam the shores of the Nuur. In times of chaos, when jackals and wolves are in power, they hide deep in the bottom of the Nuur, and no one can see them. Some people vividly and excitedly say that in 1945, the Eighth Route Army and the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces defeated the Japanese invaders in the Battle of Wolf's Nest Gully and liberated the grassland. The golden foals danced on the edge of the Nuur, and the grassland shimmered with golden light. Later, when the Eighth Route Army withdrew from the grassland, the golden foals also disappeared. In 1948, the Eighth Route Army came again, and the grassland became forever the people's grassland. The golden foals often appeared on the edge of the Nuur again, and Anguli Nuur always shone with golden light.

　　Yes, in those dark years, Anguli Nuur was not only without light and gloomy, but also full of bloodshed. Under the rule of the reactionaries, the local tyrants on the grassland committed all kinds of evil, and bandits ran rampant. The herdsmen and farmers suffered cruel exploitation, robbery, and slaughter. The grassland was like a thin horse suffering from hunger and cold, and Anguli Nuur was its eye filled with tears, unable to bear to see the bloodstains and scars on the herdsmen and farmers. The Japanese imperialists committed even more heinous crimes here. During their occupation of the grassland, they enslaved the people of the grassland, forcing them to build fortifications in the Wolf's Nest Gully area. In order to maintain military secrets, the heinous Japanese devils knocked down more than two thousand Chinese laborers, loaded them onto trucks, and dragged them to Anguli Nuur… Alas! All the victims were buried in the Nuur. At that time, the sky and earth changed color, the grassland wept silently, how could Anguli Nuur emit light?

　　Now, the grassland is shining with the brilliant socialist light. The grassland, which has always been known for its poverty and desolation, has become a place of abundant grain, thriving livestock, flowers blooming everywhere, and shady trees. Anguli Nuur is also providing the people with a wealth of resources. When herdsmen drive their cattle or sheep through here, when tourists pass by in cars, they can see workers in the salt fields making salt on the edge of the Nuur, and they can see fishing boats floating on the Nuur. The new people and new things, songs and laughter on the grassland, and the morning sun and sunset, blue sky and white clouds, are all deeply reflected in the Nuur, truly shimmering with golden light and full of vitality. People say that the golden foals of Anguli Nuur have now grown into the galloping horses of the Great Leap Forward, not only roaming the shores of the Nuur, but also galloping across the entire vast grassland.

    淖
    冯健男
    蒙民称湖泊为淖。草原上有了淖，就像绿毯上有了夜明珠。
    比如安固里淖，真是一首优美的诗。
    这个淖很大，很大。骑着马儿围着它跑一圈，得跑两个整天。在淖边行走或观望，就像身在海边。
    关于安固里淖，有许多民闻传说。其中的一个说，在这个淖中，有两匹金马驹。在太平盛世，它们常常深夜出来，游行于淖边。在乱世，在豺狼当道的时候，它们就深深地隐藏于淖底，任何人也见不到它们。有人绘声绘形，眉飞色舞地说，1945年，八路军和苏蒙联军在狼窝沟一战中击败了日寇，解放了草原，金马驹在淖边翩翩起舞，草原上金光闪闪。后来八路军从草原撤退了，金马驹也就隐没了。1948年，八路军来了，草原永远成为人民的草原了，金马驹又经常出现于淖边，安固里淖永远闪耀着金光。
    是啊，在那黑暗的年代，安固里淖不但是无光的，阴暗的，而且是充满血腥的。在反动派的统治下，草原上恶霸作恶多端，土匪横行无忌，牧民和农民受着残酷的剥削、抢劫和宰割，草原像一匹饥寒交迫的瘦马，安固里淖是它的充满热泪的眼，它不忍见牧民、农民身上的血迹和血痕。日本帝国主义者在这里更是犯了滔天大罪。他们在占领草原期间，奴役着草原上的人民，迫使人民在狼窝沟一带修筑工事，为了保持军事秘密，万恶的日寇把两千多中国民工打倒在地，装上卡车，拖到安固里淖……唉！受难者全部葬身淖中。当时，天地为之变色，草原泣不成声，安固里淖哪能发出光彩？
    现在，草原在发着灿烂如锦的社会主义的光芒。向来以贫困和荒凉著称的草原，变得五谷丰登，六畜兴旺，红花遍地，绿树成荫。安固里淖也在向人民提供着大量的财富。当牧人赶着牛群或羊群经过这里的时候，当旅客坐着汽车经过这里的时候，就可以看到盐场里的工人在淖边制盐，就可以看到淖上在泛着打鱼船。草原上的新人新事，歌声笑声，和那朝阳夕照，蓝天白云，都深深映入淖中，真是金光闪闪，气象万千。人们都说，安固里淖的金马驹，现在已经成长为大跃进的骏马，不但游行于淖边，而且在整个辽阔的草原上飞奔。
