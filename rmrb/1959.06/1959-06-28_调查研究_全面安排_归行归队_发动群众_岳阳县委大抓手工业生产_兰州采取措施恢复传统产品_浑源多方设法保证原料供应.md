Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 27th. The Yueyang County Party Committee took effective measures to strengthen leadership and quickly restored and rectified handicraft production to serve industrial and agricultural production and the people's lives. At present, the county has restored and newly established 260 large-scale handicraft factories, 117 small joint factories, 166 mobile stations, and 754 mobile groups. In terms of products, production materials have been restored and increased from more than 100 kinds to more than 150 kinds, and daily necessities have also been restored and increased from 200 kinds to 339 kinds.

In the past year, Yueyang County upgraded and transferred some small handicraft industries to factories, which affected the supply of small commodities and small tools in the market and caused some inconvenience to the masses. After discovering these situations at the end of December last year, the Yueyang County Party Committee immediately took measures to strengthen the leadership of the handicraft industry. In addition to the county party committee frequently discussing handicraft issues, a full-time cadre was set up in the county party committee's industrial department, and a handicraft section was set up in the county industrial bureau to conduct specific leadership of handicraft production.

At the same time, according to the diverse characteristics of handicraft products, the Yueyang County Party Committee immediately organized more than 1,600 handicraft workers who had changed their careers to return to their original production posts and actively restore more than 140 industries that had been neglected and closed down. The "Yueyang razor," "Zhou Fusun's steel fire," "Yang Yongxing's horn sickle," and other products welcomed by the masses have now resumed production. At the same time, according to the new situation, they also organized handicraft production through the organizational form of factories and reasonable layout methods. This is to set up branch factories in the handicraft factories that have been established, organize mobile stations and mobile groups, or organize comprehensive factories with branch factories, retail stores, mobile stations, and groups below. These methods are very popular among the masses.

Conducting a comprehensive inventory and planning of handicraft products and strengthening the cooperation between handicraft industry and commerce is also a major link in doing a good job in handicraft production. For example, through commercial departments, organize investigation teams to go deep into the masses to solicit opinions on handicraft products, understand the needs of the masses, and then sign supply and marketing contracts between commercial departments and handicraft departments to implement production and sales cooperation. Therefore, the county restored the original 100 kinds of products in a very short time, and added 53 kinds of new products according to the needs of production. Products such as sickles, which used to be transferred from other places, can now be produced by the county itself. This year, the county has solved the difficulties of raw materials needed for handicraft production through industrial and commercial cooperation and mobilizing the masses, which has greatly promoted the production of handicrafts.

In order to further develop handicraft production, the Yueyang County Party Committee also strengthened the operation and management of handicrafts. At present, the labor efficiency of handicraft production in the province has generally increased by 50%. The quality of products has also been significantly improved, and the pass rate of general handicraft products has reached more than 90%. More than 10,000 grass knives made by the Rongjiawan handicraft industry are all qualified.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 27th. After investigation and research, the relevant departments in Lanzhou City realized that the handicraft industry is still an indispensable part of the national economy, and therefore decided to immediately take the following measures to strengthen the leadership of the handicraft industry. 1. According to the needs of the market, rank the handicraft products that have been discontinued. Products urgently needed by the market, such as "Dongjia Kitchen Knife," "Xujia Shoes," and "Lanzhou Casserole," will immediately set up special workshops to restore production. 2. Organize handicraft workers to return to their teams. For example, workers who had originally changed their careers to learn mechanical manufacturing are now transferred back to make "Dongjia Kitchen Knife." Workers who made "Lanzhou Casserole" and "Zhujia Vinegar" are also being transferred back from refractory material factories and food factories. 3. Help solve the difficulties in the supply of raw materials. When "Dongjia Kitchen Knife" was just restored to production, the Lanzhou Iron Factory supported a batch of steel; the Yingmao She, whose products sell well throughout the country, stopped production in the previous period due to lack of raw materials, and now a batch of horse mane has been allocated to restore the production of false beards needed for performing operas. 4. Allocate funds from local industrial basic construction investment to help the handicraft industry purchase some equipment. 5. Implement special personnel, special materials, special equipment, special production tasks, and special signboards so that some traditional handicraft products can retain all their advantages. 6. Help some handicraft industries that have been upgraded to factories to solve the difficulties in technology and raw material supply, increase the variety of colors and varieties, and produce more than 20 new varieties of small commodities such as hair clips, thimbles, door locks, and small scissors. 7. Recently, a joint meeting is planned to be held in Chengguan District, where commerce and handicraft industry are concentrated, to implement the linking of production and sales of commerce and handicraft industry in order to promote the further prosperity of handicraft production. 8. Draw out a part of the handicraft workers who were originally responsible for repair work from the manufacturing industry as mobile service personnel in the factory, carrying burdens and going through the streets and alleys to repair steamers, nail pots, sharpen scissors, mend shoes, etc. for the masses.

In order to unify the leadership of the handicraft industry, cadres have been transferred to the Chengguan District, where the city's handicraft industry is most concentrated, and a handicraft office has been established in the district people's committee; the city-wide handicraft leading agency that was abolished last year is also actively preparing to be restored.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th. Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province, which has more than 2,000 handicraft workers, has solved the problem of raw materials since March this year by adopting the policy of walking on two legs, obtaining materials locally and obtaining materials from other places, so that the production plan is overfulfilled every month. At present, in addition to meeting the needs of the local market, handicraft products here will also transport hundreds of tons of native paper, tens of thousands of pairs of cloth shoes, hundreds of thousands of pieces of small farm tools, batches of ceramics, pockets, felt hats, white wine, water glue, Luo bottoms, willow utensils, etc. with a value of millions of yuan and more than 300 kinds of products to Datong, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Baotou, Jining, Hohhot, and Shijiazhuang and other cities and friendly neighboring areas.

This year, the county encountered the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. Under the leadership of the county party committee, after airing views and debates, the workers worked out eight ingenious plans to solve the difficulty of raw materials. These eight ingenious plans are: self-production, finding substitutes, comprehensive utilization, recycling waste materials, clearing warehouses, processing in rural areas, industrial and commercial assistance, and saving use. By adopting these eight ingenious plans, the raw materials of some products have been completely solved, and some have been partially solved.

At the same time, in order to develop production and meet the needs of the country and local and foreign markets, Hunyuan County handicraft factories, in accordance with the national unified chess game policy, restored some originally reasonable social division of labor and cooperation relations, and also established some new cooperation relations according to the development of production. The restoration and establishment of these cooperative relations have played a significant role in solving raw materials and developing production. For example, through the restoration of cooperative relations, the shoe factory, which has extremely close supply and marketing relations with dozens of cities such as Baotou, Hohhot, Jining, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and Datong, has doubled its output immediately after obtaining raw material support from the above-mentioned cities, and has strongly supported the cloth shoes needed by Baotou, Taiyuan, and other places. Another example is that cage luo is an indispensable tool for the people in northern Shanxi, and the quality of Hunyuan's Luo bottom is very good. However, among the four kinds of raw materials for making cage luo, only cage circles can be produced locally, and the remaining three kinds (rattan bark, bamboo, and horsetail) come from Jiangnan, Henan, Northeast, and Inner Mongolia, respectively. After the cooperative relations with these places were restored, the famous Hunyuan cage Luo craftsmen showed their great power.

    调查研究　全面安排　归行归队　发动群众
    岳阳县委大抓手工业生产
    兰州采取措施恢复传统产品　浑源多方设法保证原料供应
    本报长沙27日电　中共岳阳县委采取有效措施加强领导，迅速恢复和整顿手工业生产，为工农业生产和人民生活服务。目前，全县已恢复和新办了二百六十个大型的手工业工厂，一百一十七个小型联合工厂，一百六十六个流动站，七百五十四个流动组。产品方面，生产资料由一百多种恢复和增加到一百五十多种，生活用品也由二百种恢复和增加到三百三十九种。
    岳阳县在去年曾把一部分小手工业升级转厂，使市场上小商品、小工具的供应受到影响，给群众造成某些不方便。中共岳阳县委在去年12月底发现这些情况后，立即采取措施，加强手工业的领导，除了县委经常讨论手工业的问题外，在县委工业部设了专职干部、县工业局设了手工业科，对手工业生产进行具体的领导。
    同时，根据手工业产品多种多样的特点，中共岳阳县委立即动手组织原来改行改业的一千六百多名手工业工人，回到原来的生产岗位，积极恢复一度被忽视而停业的一百四十多种行业。群众欢迎的“岳阳剃刀”“周福孙的钢火”“杨永兴的牛角禾镰”等等，现在都恢复了生产。同时，根据新的形势，他们还通过工厂的组织形式和合理布点的方法，组织手工业生产。这就是在已办起来的手工业工厂中，设分厂，组织流动站和巡回流动组，或组织综合性工厂，下面设分厂和门市部、流动站、组。这些办法很受群众欢迎。
    对手工业产品进行全面摸底和规划，加强手工业与商业的协作，也是搞好手工业生产的一个主要环节。例如通过商业部门组织调查组，深入群众征求对手工业产品的意见，了解群众的需要，再由商业部门与手工业部门签订供销合同，实行产销协作。因此，全县在很短时间恢复了原有的一百种产品，根据生产的需要增加了五十三种新产品，像过去靠外地调进的禾镰等产品，现在本县就可以自己生产了。全县今年通过工商协作，发动群众，还解决了手工业生产所需要的原料材料的困难，大大推动了手工业的生产。
    中共岳阳县委为进一步发展手工业生产，还加强了手工业的经营管理。目前全省手工业生产的劳动工效，普遍提高50％。产品质量也有显著提高，一般手工业产品的正品率达到90％以上。荣家弯手工业打制的一万多把草刀，把把合格。
    本报兰州27日电　兰州市有关部门经过调查研究，认识到手工业依然是国民经济中不可缺少的一个环节，因此决定立即采取以下措施，加强对手工业的领导。一、根据市场需要情况，对已经停产的手工业品进行排队，像“董家菜刀”、“徐家鞋”“兰州砂锅”等市场迫切需要的产品，立即设立专门车间恢复生产。二、组织手工业工人归队。如原来已改行学机械制造的工人，现在重新调回来做“董家菜刀”。制“兰州砂锅”、“朱家醋”的工人，也正在从耐火材料厂、食品厂等调回归队。三、帮助解决原料供应上的困难。“董家菜刀”刚恢复生产时，由兰州铁工厂支援一批钢铁；产品畅销全国的缨毛社，前一时期因为缺少原料，停止生产，现已调拨给一批马尾鬃，恢复生产演戏需用的假胡须。四、由地方工业基本建设投资中拨出资金，帮助手工业添置一些设备。五、实行专人、专料、专门设备、专门的生产任务和专用招牌等办法，让传统的一些手工业名产能够把全部优点都保留下来。六、帮助一些已升级为工厂的手工业，解决技术和原料供应上的困难，增加花色品种，生产发卡、顶针、门锁、小剪等二十多种小百货新品种。七、最近准备在商业和手工业集中的城关区召开一个联席会议，实行商业和手工业的产销挂钩，以促进手工业生产的进一步繁荣。八、从制造业中抽出一部分原来担负修理工作的手工业工人，作为工厂中的流动服务人员，肩挑担子，沿街串巷为群众修蒸笼、钉锅、磨剪子、补鞋等等。
    为了把手工业统一领导起来，在全市手工业最集中的城关区，已经抽调了干部，在区人民委员会内成立手工业办公室；去年撤销的全市性的手工业领导机构，也在积极筹备恢复中。
    本报太原27日电　拥有二千多名手工业工人的山西省浑源县，从今年3月以来，由于采取了就地取材与外地取材两条腿走路的方针，解决了原材料问题，使生产计划月月超额完成。目前，这里手工业产品除满足当地市场需要而外，并将成百吨土纸、成万双布鞋、数十万件小农具、成批的陶瓷器、口袋、毡帽、白酒、水胶、罗底、柳器等价值百万元的产品三百余种，源源运往大同、太原、张垣、包头、集宁、呼和浩特和石家庄等城市和友邻地区。
    今年这个县遇到了原材料不足的困难。在县委领导下，经过鸣放辩论，职工们研究出了八条妙计，解决了原材料困难。这八条妙计是：自己生产、寻找代用品、综合利用、回收废料、清查仓库、下乡加工、工商协助和节约使用。采用这八条妙计，有些产品的原材料全部得到解决，有些部分得到解决。
    同时，为了发展生产，满足国家和本地外地市场需要，浑源县手工业工厂，根据全国一盘棋的方针，恢复了一些原来合理的社会分工与协作关系，并根据生产的发展又建立了一些新的协作关系。这些协作关系的恢复和建立，对于解决原材料和发展生产起了重大的作用。例如通过恢复协作关系，和包头、呼和浩特、集宁、张家口、太原、石家庄、大同等数十个城市供销关系极为密切的鞋厂，取得上述城市原料支援后，产品立即成倍地增加，大力支援了包头、太原等地所需要的布鞋。再如笼罗是晋北地区人民不可缺少的用具，浑源的罗底质量又是很好的，可是制造笼罗的四种原材料中，本地只能生产笼圈一种，其余三种（藤皮、竹子、马尾）又分别来自江南、河南、东北、内蒙古等地，和这些地方的协作关系恢复后，有名的浑源笼罗匠们就大展威力了。
