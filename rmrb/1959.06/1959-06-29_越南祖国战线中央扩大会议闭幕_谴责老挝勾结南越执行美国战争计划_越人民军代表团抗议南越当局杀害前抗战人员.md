Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th. According to Vietnam News Agency: The tenth enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front closed on the 27th. The communique issued by the meeting strongly protested the Phoui Sananikone government's collusion with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to realize the war plans of the American imperialists in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The meeting requested the International Commission for Laos to resume its work as soon as possible to ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos.

The meeting also called for an early summit conference to strive for a peaceful resolution of the German and West Berlin issues, ease world tensions, and end the Cold War. The meeting also expressed warm welcome to the resolutions adopted at the recent meeting of the World Peace Council in Stockholm.

The meeting expressed its full support for the agricultural cooperativization policy formulated by the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government, and called on all the people of North Vietnam to advance this movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 27th. According to Vietnam News Agency, the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission for Vietnam on June 15th, condemning the Ngo Dinh Diem clique for murdering many former resistance personnel and patriots in accordance with Ordinance No. 10 of 1959.

Ordinance No. 10 of 1959, promulgated by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique on May 6th, stipulated the establishment of three Special Military Tribunals, which have the power to impose death sentences or life imprisonment without appeal or defense.

The Liaison Delegation listed in the letter countless new crimes committed by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Among them was the murder of six former resistance personnel by the South Vietnamese An Xuyen province authorities on the day Ordinance No. 10 of 1959 was promulgated (May 6th).

The letter also revealed that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique had taken various retaliatory actions against former resistance personnel and patriots still imprisoned in South Vietnamese concentration camps. In addition to the mass poisoning of six thousand people in the Phu Loi concentration camp, the South Vietnamese authorities also forced detainees to do hard labor. Anyone who did not do the assigned work would be charged with sabotage and sentenced by the Special Military Tribunal.

The Liaison Delegation requested the International Commission to investigate these new massacres by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique without delay and take urgent measures to stop these crimes in South Vietnam.
