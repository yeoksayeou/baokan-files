The Yongle Palace is located in Yongle Town, Ruicheng County, Shanxi Province. During the Tang Dynasty, it was Yongle County, and it was changed to a town in the third year of Xining during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty (1070 AD). It is said that this place was the hometown of Lu Yan (also known as Lu Dongbin) in the Tang Dynasty. During the Tang Dynasty, his former residence was converted into the Lu Gong Temple. During the Song and Jin dynasties, the temple was changed into a Taoist temple. It was destroyed by fire in the third year of Zhongtong during the reign of Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty (1262 AD). After being rebuilt on the original site, it was renamed "Da Chunyang Wanshou Palace," which is the basic building of the Yongle Palace known for its Yuan Dynasty Taoist murals. The only Yuan Dynasty buildings that remain now are the Wuji Gate, the Sanqing Hall, the Chunyang Hall, and the Chongyang Hall. The precious Yuan Dynasty Taoist murals are painted in these buildings, covering approximately 873 square meters. These elaborate masterpieces by art masters more than 600 years ago are the most perfect existing murals in the Central Plains of China. Among them, the daily duty god statues in the Sanqing Hall and the "Picture of the Immortal Journey and Manifestation of Emperor Chunyang" in the Chunyang Hall are the most exquisite.

The Sanqing Hall, also known as the Wuji Hall, has magnificent architecture and exquisite paintings. All the murals cover 424 square meters, with a height of 4.26 meters. A total of more than 280 daily duty god statues are painted, led by the Azure Dragon and White Tiger gods on the left and right south walls, surrounding eight main statues. There are also images of immortals, nobles, heavenly soldiers, strongmen, golden boys, and jade girls, resembling Wu Zongyuan's "Court of Immortals" in the Northern Song Dynasty. However, the murals in the Sanqing Hall seek movement and change within a static state of worship. The figures in the paintings have a myriad of dynamic variations, and the costumes and ceremonial guards are rich and colorful. The beards and eyebrows of the military generals are flying, while the real people seem to want to ascend to immortality. The solemn and majestic main statues and the beautiful and elegant jade girls face each other from afar. Some are talking to each other, some are contemplating, some are listening, and some are watching, echoing each other and creating extraordinary vividness. With only concise lines, the different genders, ages, personalities, and dynamic expressions of each person are expressed vividly, reaching the wonderful realm of "conveying the spirit through depiction." In terms of coloring, the traditional heavy color outlining and filling method is used, with ink lines as the backbone, filled with gold color, and vermilion and azurite mineral colors are used in a planned and dispersed manner. White is cleverly used to separate them, and detailed patterns are carefully processed to give people a sense of both distant viewing and close-up appreciation. Moreover, all the murals in the hall are highly decorative, combined with the caisson ceiling paintings, forming a colorful, cloud-filled, and rhythmic unified whole.

The Chunyang Hall, also known as the Huncheng Hall, is commonly known as the Lu Zu Hall. The murals in the hall are mainly the "Picture of the Immortal Journey and Manifestation of Emperor Chunyang." The author cleverly interweaves the life story of Lu Dongbin (also known as Chunyangzi) into a large composition with an overall sense through 52 comic strips, which is very natural. The content of the murals encompasses a wide range of subjects, including life in palaces, mountains, villages, boats, restaurants, teahouses, kitchens, and medical halls, as well as the birth of babies, memorial services after death, and so on, reflecting the daily life and social customs of the time. In terms of expression techniques, each comic strip has a clear storyline. The upper, lower, left, and right strips are cleverly connected by mountains, rocks, clouds, and trees, without any sense of abruptness, demonstrating the ingenuity of the mural author. For example, the distant mountains in the lower strip serve as the foreground for the upper strip, and in the composition of one strip, Lu Dongbin can appear several times as the story develops, without any time or space constraints, and it looks very natural. Although all the murals were painted collectively, they still maintain a unified style due to good division of labor. In addition, the large mural "Zhong Liquan Crossing Lu Dongbin" on the north wall of the fan-shaped wall is also very wonderful. The content of this mural depicts the scene of Zhong Liquan persuading Lu Dongbin to become a monk and practice Taoism. The characters are portrayed very successfully. Zhong Liquan's boldness and eloquence, and the excited expression between his eyebrows are depicted very profoundly; Lu Dongbin lowers his head and listens quietly to his teacher's teachings, and his inner intense struggle is also vividly expressed. The depiction of the background pine trees, rocks, and streams is free and unrestrained, and the ink colors are dripping, achieving a harmonious unity with the character depiction, which is truly a rare masterpiece.

Our motherland is carrying out great socialist construction. For the construction of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the Yongle Palace will be moved to the vicinity of the Wulong Temple northeast of Ruicheng for reconstruction (the relocation is currently underway), and all the murals will also be removed from the walls and moved to the new site in their original state. The Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, on the one hand, for reference in mural restoration, and on the other hand, for the study and learning of the precious mural heritage of the motherland, has organized teachers and students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts to go there twice to make copies of the murals.

    永乐宫的壁画艺术
    陆鸿年
    永乐宫位于山西省芮城县永乐镇。唐代是永乐县，到宋神宗熙宁三年（公元1070年）才改为镇。此地相传是唐代吕嵒（即吕洞宾）的故里，唐代就在他的故居改建为吕公祠，宋金改祠为观，元世祖中统三年（公元1262年）毁于火，在原址上重建后，改称“大纯阳万寿宫”，就是现在以元代道教壁画闻名的永乐宫的基本建筑。现在仅存的元代建筑物有无极门、三清殿、纯阳殿和重阳殿四处。珍贵的元代道教壁画就分画在这些建筑物里，共约八百七十三平方公尺。这些六百多年前艺术巨匠的精心杰作，是我国中原地区现存最完美的壁画，其中以三清殿的值日神像和纯阳殿的“纯阳帝君仙游显化之图”最为精美。
    三清殿又名无极殿，建筑雄伟彩绘精致，全部壁画四百二十四平方公尺，画面高四公尺二十六公分，共画值日神像二百八十余人，以左右侧南墙的青龙白虎二神为前导，围绕八尊主像，画有仙真侯伯天丁力士金童玉女等像，作风很像北宋武宗元“朝元仙仗图”，但三清殿的壁画是在朝拜的静止状态中求动的变化的。画中人物形象动态千变万化，服饰仪仗丰富多彩，武将的须眉飞动，真人则翩翩欲仙，庄严肃穆的主像和美丽文雅的玉女遥遥相对，有的对语，有的沉思，有的在倾听，有的在注视，彼此呼应，生动异常。只用简练的线条便把每个人的不同性别、年龄、性格和动态表情表达无遗，达到了“传神阿睹”的妙境。在着色方面是用传统重彩勾填的方法，以墨线为骨干，填以金色，有计划地分散使用朱砂及青绿石色，巧妙的用白色间隔起来，有重点的加工细部纹样，使人看了，有远观近取的效果。而且殿内的全部壁画装饰性较强，配上藻井彩绘，构成一个五光十色云霞灿烂富有旋律的统一整体。
    纯阳殿又名混成殿，俗称吕祖殿。全殿壁画以“纯阳帝君仙游显化之图”为主。作者把吕洞宾（号纯阳子）的一生故事，通过五十二幅连环画的形式巧妙地交错在一个有整体感的大构图里，非常自然。壁画内容包罗万象，有宫庭、山野、村舍、舟中、酒楼、茶肆、厨房、医馆的生活，有婴儿的降生，有死后的奠祭等等，反映出了当时的日常生活与社会风貌。在表现手法方面各幅连环画都有一明确的故事情节，上下左右各幅之间用山、石、云、树，巧妙地联系在一起，没有生硬的感觉，表现了壁画作者的匠心经营，比如下幅的远山，正好作了上一幅的近景，而在一幅的构图中又随着故事的发展，吕洞宾可以数现，不受任何时间空间的限制，而且看去又很自然。全部壁画虽然是集体绘制，但是因为有很好的分工，所以仍不失其统一的风格。此外，扇墙北壁“锺离权渡吕洞宾”大幅壁画也非常精彩。这幅壁画的内容是描绘锺离劝说吕洞宾出家修道的情景。人物形象刻画得很成功。锺离权的豪爽健谈，眉目间的激动表情，描写得非常深刻；吕洞宾俯首静听老师的教导，他内心激烈斗争的精神状态也被表现得栩栩如生。背景松石与溪水的描绘，用笔奔放，墨色淋漓，与人物描绘取得了协调统一，实为难得的佳作。
    我们的祖国正在进行伟大的社会主义建设，为了三门峡水库的修建，永乐宫将迁往芮城东北五龙庙左近重建（现正动工迁移），全部壁画也将从墙壁上揭下来，原样迁移新址。文化部文物局一方面为了壁画修复的参考，一方面也为研究和学习祖国珍贵的壁画遗产，曾组织中央美术学院的师生两次前往作壁画的临摹工作。（附图片）
