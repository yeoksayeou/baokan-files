Socialist Countries' Industrial Construction Flourishes
Enterprises in Various Parts of the Soviet Union Frequently Report Good News of Competitions; Many New Factories in Romania, Vietnam, and Other Countries Put into Production

·Poland·
Dozens of Power Plants Under Construction

Poland is vigorously developing its electric power industry. Currently, thirty-four locations across the country are undergoing construction and expansion of power plants. By the end of this year, Poland will have approximately 600,000 kilowatts of new power generation equipment put into production, with power generation reaching 26 billion kilowatt-hours.

Due to Poland's abundant reserves of brown coal, easy extraction, and low costs, Poland is prioritizing the construction of thermal power plants fueled by brown coal when developing its electric power industry, especially focusing on the construction of large-scale thermal power plants. Currently, in addition to the three large-scale thermal power plants being built in Konin, large-scale thermal power plants with a power generation capacity of over 500,000 kilowatts each are also being built in Turów, Adamów, and Pątnów. The Turów thermal power plant has a power generation capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts, making it one of the largest thermal power plants in Europe. The proportion of electricity generated from brown coal in Poland's total power generation will increase from 1.6% in 1958 to 28.5% in 1965.

While vigorously developing thermal power plants, attention is also being paid to the development of hydroelectric power plants. Currently, the construction of five hydroelectric power stations is underway in Poland.

·Romania·
A Batch of New Chemical Plants Put Into Production

A batch of newly built chemical plants and workshops in Romania have recently been put into production one after another.

Not long ago, the first phase of the Săvineşti artificial fiber factory, which has a high degree of automation, was put into production.

This year, textile industrial enterprises will be able to weave 1.5 million square meters of textiles and 700,000 pieces of knitwear with synthetic yarn produced by this factory, and produce 7 million to 8 million square meters of various textiles with yarn mixed with synthetic fibers.

The Navodari sulfuric acid and fertilizer plant has also recently been put into full production. This modern factory was built with the full assistance of the Soviet Union. It can produce 150,000 tons of superphosphate per year. Currently, Romania has two more fertilizer plants under construction with a total annual production capacity of 310,000 tons.

A batch of workshops producing chemicals have also recently been put into production, such as the 2,500-ton annual production capacity bicarbonate workshop of the "Stalin" chemical complex, and the phenol production workshop of the Făgăraş No. 1 Chemical Plant.

·Mongolia·
Unprecedentedly Huge Basic Construction Tasks

The scale of capital construction in the Mongolian People's Republic this year is unprecedentedly huge, with construction tasks increasing by 50.2% compared to 1958. The basic construction tasks for the first four months of this year have been successfully completed.

Agvanluvsan, First Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian State Construction Affairs Committee, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that this year Mongolia plans to build factories, farms, and employee dormitories with a total construction area of over 198,000 square meters.

Since the country has basically achieved agricultural and pastoral cooperation, creating more favorable conditions for further development of agricultural and pastoral production, the basic construction tasks in the agricultural and pastoral sectors have also been expanded compared to previous years. This year, buildings with an area of 69,000 square meters will be built in agricultural and pastoral sectors such as farms and ranches.

This year, the national investment in capital construction has increased by 25.2% compared to 1958, and the ranks of construction workers have also grown. There are currently more than 15,600 construction workers in the country.

·Vietnam·
Two Phosphate Fertilizer Plants Built with Local Materials

Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: Two new Vietnamese phosphate fertilizer plants, with a combined annual production of approximately 13,000 tons of fertilizer, were recently completed. The first factory is located near the Yong Sheng phosphate mine in the mountainous area of Liangshan Province, and the other is being built in Ham Rong, North Central (Thanh Hoa Province). These two factories have already begun production to meet the huge demand for fertilizers for autumn crops in a timely manner.

Together with the main Haiphong phosphate fertilizer plant (annual production of 25,500 tons of fertilizer), these two new factories will play a significant role in promoting autumn rice production to reach more than 4 million tons. This number is close to the total of last year's double-season production.

These two factories were built and equipped by Vietnamese workers using local materials.

    社会主义国家工业建设一片繁荣
    苏联各地企业频传竞赛喜报　罗越等国许多新厂投入生产
    ·波兰·
    数十座发电站在兴建中
    波兰正在大力发展电力工业。目前，全国有三十四个地方在兴建和扩建发电站。到今年年底，波兰将约有六十万瓩发电能力的新设备投入生产，发电量将达二百六十亿度。
    由于波兰褐煤埋藏量丰富，开采容易，成本低廉，在发展电力工业时，波兰首先注意建设以褐煤为燃料的热电站，尤其着重兴建大型的热电站。目前，除在科宁建设的三个大型热电站外，还在图鲁夫、阿达穆夫、庞特诺夫等地建设发电能力都在五十万瓩以上的大型热电站，而图鲁夫热电站的发电能力达一百二十万瓩，为欧洲最大热电站之一。用褐煤发电的电力在波兰的总发电量中所占的比重，将从1958年的1.6％增加到1965年的28.5％。
    在大力发展火力发电站的同时，也注意发展水力发电站。现在波兰有五个水电站的建设工程正在加紧进行。
    ·罗马尼亚·
    一批新化工厂投入生产
    罗马尼亚一批新建的化学工厂和车间在最近相继投入生产。
    不久前，具有高度自动化水平的塞维内斯蒂人造纤维厂的第一期工程投入了生产。
    今年纺织工业企业将能够用这座工厂生产的合成纱织出一百五十万平方公尺的纺织品、七十万件针织品，另外用混有合成纤维的纱生产七百万到八百万平方公尺的各种纺织品。
    纳伏达里硫酸和化肥厂也在最近全部投入生产。这个现代化的工厂是在苏联全面援助下建成的。它每年可以生产十五万吨过磷酸钙。目前，罗马尼亚还有两个一年生产能力共三十一万吨的化肥厂正在建设中。
    最近投入生产的还有一批生产化学品的车间，如“斯大林”化学联合厂的年产能力为二千五百吨的重碳酸盐车间，弗各拉什第一化工厂的生产酚的车间等。
    ·蒙古·
    基本建设任务空前巨大
    蒙古人民共和国今年的基本建设规模空前巨大，建设任务比1958年增加50.2％。今年头四个月的基本建设任务已经胜利完成。
    蒙古国家建筑事务委员会第一副主席阿格万鲁布桑对新华社记者说，今年蒙古计划修建的工厂、农牧场和职工宿舍的建筑面积，共达十九万八千多平方公尺。
    由于全国已经基本上实现了农牧业合作化，为进一步发展农牧业生产创造了更加有利的条件，因此，在农牧业方面的基本建设任务也比往年扩大了。今年将在农牧场等农牧部门兴建六万九千平方公尺面积的建筑物。
    今年全国的基本建设投资额比1958年增加了25.2％，建筑工人的队伍也壮大了。目前全国有一万五千六百多名建筑工人。
    ·越南·
    就地取材建成两磷肥厂
    据越南通讯社5月28日报道：年产共约一万三千吨肥料的越南两个新磷肥工厂最近完工。第一个工厂设立在谅山省山区永胜磷矿附近，另一个建设在中北部（清化省）咸龙。这两个工厂已经开始投入生产，以便及时满足秋季作物对肥料的巨大要求。
    这两个新工厂同海防的主要磷肥工厂（年产二万五千五百吨肥料）一起将在促使秋季大米产量达到四百多万吨方面起很大作用。这个数目将近达到去年双季产量的总和。
    这两个工厂都是由越南工人就地取材建筑和装备起来的。
