Striving for Diversification on the Basis of Self-Sufficiency
Chongqing Expands Vegetable Varieties
Thirty Varieties and Fifty Styles Available in June

(Our Dispatch) Chongqing, while ensuring basic self-sufficiency in vegetable production, is further expanding the variety of vegetables and increasing the production of spices and flavoring vegetables.

Recently, many people's communes in the suburbs of Chongqing, mainly engaged in vegetable production, have established specialized teams for the production of small-variety vegetables to improve cultivation techniques and ensure the production of these vegetables. Chili peppers, a daily necessity for Sichuanese people, have been planted on more than 10,000 mu this year, exceeding the planting area of previous years. Renhe People's Commune recently planted 5,000 mu of small-variety vegetables. The Jiulong Production Brigade of this commune has planted 270 varieties of vegetables. The Qilong Production Brigade of the Huaxi People's Commune established a specialized team for spice vegetables and designated 600 mu as a base for spice vegetables, having already planted more than 200 mu with scallions, garlic sprouts, chives, and other spices. This year, people's communes have also introduced more than 80 new vegetable varieties from other regions for trial planting, of which more than 10 have begun to supply the market. The variety of vegetables sown by people's communes in the suburbs this year will expand from 400 to 800. In June, the market will supply 30 varieties of vegetables with more than 50 styles.

The vegetable base in the suburbs of Chongqing has now expanded to more than 250,000 mu. From January to May this year, the total vegetable output of the city reached more than 740 million jin, with each person able to eat 1.2 jin of fresh vegetables per day, basically achieving a balanced market supply and eliminating the vegetable shortage in April and May that occurred in previous years. On this basis, in order to meet the diverse needs of the people for vegetables, the Chongqing agricultural and forestry departments and commercial departments have determined a plan to expand the variety.

In grasping the production of small-variety vegetables in Chongqing, the relevant departments have helped communes solve some specific problems. In the past, these small-variety and spice vegetables were mostly produced by farmers on their private plots during their spare time, with little cost and labor. Now, with large-scale production, communes have to spend a lot of labor, increase fertilizer, and require special cultivation techniques. Moreover, according to surveys by commercial and agricultural departments, the income from the production of small-variety vegetables such as garlic, scallions, and chili peppers is not as high as that from high-yield bulk vegetables. Therefore, many people's communes are willing to grow more high-yield crops and neglect the production of small-variety vegetables. To this end, the Chongqing commercial department has reasonably adjusted the purchase prices of several small-variety vegetables based on the production costs of the communes. Some areas have also established price negotiation committees composed of commercial departments, communes, and consumer representatives to investigate and negotiate reasonable vegetable prices. The agricultural and forestry departments have also held multiple meetings with commune and district cadres recently to understand their difficulties and requirements in vegetable production and to help solve them. At present, there are basically enough seeds for small-variety vegetables. Commercial and agricultural departments are helping communes solve the need for pesticides and helping establish vegetable processing plants.

### 在自给的基础上争取多样化  重庆扩大蔬菜品种  六月份上市三十个品种五十多种花样

    在自给的基础上争取多样化
    重庆扩大蔬菜品种
    六月份上市三十个品种五十多种花样
    本报讯　重庆市在蔬菜生产基本自给的基础上，正在进一步扩大蔬菜的花色品种，增产香料和调味等蔬菜。
    最近重庆市郊不少以蔬菜生产为主的人民公社建立了蔬菜小品种生产专业队，以提高栽培技术和保证小品种蔬菜生产。海椒是四川人天天必吃的调料，今年各人民公社播种了一万多亩，比历年播种面积都大。人和人民公社最近已经播种小品种蔬菜五千亩。这个社的九龙生产大队播种的蔬菜达到二百七十种。花溪人民公社麒龙生产大队建立了香料蔬菜专业队，划出了香料蔬菜基地六百亩，现在已经种了葱、蒜苗、韭菜等二百多亩。今年各人民公社还从外地引进了八十多种新蔬菜试种，其中已有十多种开始供应市场。市郊人民公社今年播种的蔬菜花色和品种将由四百个扩大到八百个。6月份市场上供应的蔬菜达到三十个品种、五十多种花色。
    重庆市郊蔬菜基地，目前已经扩大到二十五万多亩。今年1到5月份，全市蔬菜总产量达到七亿四千万斤以上，每人每天能吃到鲜菜一斤二两；基本上做到均衡上市，消灭了历年4、5月份青黄不接的缺菜现象。在这个基础上，为了满足人民对蔬菜多种多样的需要，重庆农林部门和商业部门确定了扩大花色品种的计划。
    重庆在抓小品种蔬菜生产中，有关部门曾帮助公社解决了一些具体问题。以往这些小品种和香料蔬菜多是由农民在自留地上利用业余时间生产的，成本和劳力花费不大。现在采取大面积生产，公社要花费很多劳力，增加肥料和需要特别的栽培技术。而且，据商业、农林部门调查，大蒜、葱、海椒等小品种蔬菜生产收益不及大宗高产蔬菜收益大。因此，不少人民公社愿意多种高产作物，而忽视小品种蔬菜生产。为此，重庆市商业部门根据公社生产成本合理调整了几种小品种蔬菜的收购价格。部分地区还建立由商业部门、公社、消费者代表组成的议价委员会，调查和议订蔬菜的合理价格。农林部门最近也多次召开公社和各区干部会议，认真了解他们在生产蔬菜中的困难和要求，并帮助加以解决。现在，小品种菜籽已基本够用，商业部门和农林部门正帮助公社解决农药的需要，和帮助建立蔬菜加工厂。
