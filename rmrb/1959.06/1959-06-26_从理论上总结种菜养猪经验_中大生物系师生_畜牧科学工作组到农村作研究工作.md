Summarizing Vegetable Growing and Pig Raising Experience Theoretically
Biology Department Teachers and Students of Zhongda University and Animal Husbandry Science Working Group Conduct Research in Rural Areas
    (Our report) Guangzhou—Teachers and students of the Biology Department of Zhongshan University are summarizing the vegetable production experience in the suburbs of Guangzhou, further implementing the Party's education policy, and improving the quality of teaching.
    In mid-January of this year, a group of teachers from this department and some students from the third and fourth grades of the botany major formed four groups to conduct investigations and research in vegetable production areas with more experience in the suburbs, raising the practical experience of farmers to the level of scientific theory for research and summarization. In the course of their work, they first took farmers as their teachers, engaged in production and labor with the farmers, humbly learned production techniques from the farmers, and jointly established field archives for systematic experimental research. Now, their summary work on autumn-sown and winter-harvested vegetables has been completed, and they have summarized the experience of increasing production of major vegetables such as cabbage, choy sum, and snow peas during this period, providing reference materials for improving teaching and writing summary scientific papers.
    Now, their research results, such as measures to improve land utilization and "alternating rows and intercropping," have begun to be promoted in the suburbs of Guangzhou. Through this summary work, the teachers have also gained a lot in teaching. Many teachers believe that "dead theory has become living knowledge." For example, one lecturer used to only know from books that growing snow peas requires more watering and more fertilization, but did not know when to water and how much to water appropriately. In actual production, farmers told him to water only two days after sowing, otherwise the seeds would rot. He combined scientific theory with research and found out the reason for this practice. It turned out that the germination of seeds relies on the moisture in the ground, and too much water would reduce the air, hindering the respiration of the seeds, which would easily rot. In this way, they obtained many vivid materials from actual production, analyzed them theoretically, enriched their knowledge, enriched the teaching content, and improved the quality of teaching. For example, in the past, when they lectured on crop cultivation, they only lectured according to the textbook, without doing experiments, let alone field production. The content of the lectures was very impractical, using more foreign and northern materials and less southern and local materials. Teachers could only lecture but could not do, and students found it difficult to learn and remember. This course had been taught for four or five years without solving the problem. Now that they have summarized the vegetable production experience in the suburbs, learned practical experience and agricultural technology from the farmers, they have not only enriched the teaching materials in terms of lecture content and overcome the tendency of theory being divorced from practice, but can also guide students to engage in agricultural production, combining teaching with labor production. Therefore, the crop cultivation teaching syllabus they recently formulated specifically embodies the teaching principles of combining theoretical lectures with production practice, combining classroom lectures with field cultivation, and combining production labor with scientific research. In the past, when they lectured on plant physiology, they only copied a set of ideas from books to implement Michurin's theory. They never had a deep understanding of Michurin's theory and spoke stiffly. This time, they went to the suburbs to summarize vegetable experience, planted experimental fields with farmers, and experienced the entire production process from sowing to harvesting. They not only grasped the general laws of plant growth and development, but also realized the close relationship between plant organisms and external living conditions such as water, soil, fertilizer, and light, and growth and development. They gained a deep understanding of Michurin's theory and used vivid practice to prove Michurin's theory of the unity of biological organisms and external environmental conditions during lectures.
    At present, the teachers and students of this department are continuing to summarize the spring-sown and summer-harvested vegetable production, preparing to summarize the experience of increasing the production of major vegetables in the suburbs of Guangzhou throughout the year around the National Day.

    (Our report) Changsha—The Animal Husbandry Science Working Group of the Institute of Animal Husbandry of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has achieved remarkable results in combining production with animal husbandry scientific research in Wangyue People's Commune, Changsha County, Hunan Province, over the past year.
    This working group has seven scientific workers in animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and feeding management. In April of last year, after they arrived at the commune, they first took the pig farm as their base, helped the commune solve problems in production, and carried out scientific research. They helped breeders with artificial insemination, solving the difficulty of insufficient breeding pigs.
    They also summarized the "eat small meals frequently" pig raising method based on the local experience of raising pigs, which worked very well. In the past year, this working group has also helped the commune train more than 50 feeders, inseminators, and veterinarians.

    从理论上总结种菜养猪经验
    中大生物系师生  畜牧科学工作组到农村作研究工作
    本报讯　中山大学生物系师生总结广州郊区蔬菜生产经验，进一步贯彻了党的教育方针，提高了教学质量。
    今年1月中旬，这个系的一部分教师和植物专业三、四年级部分学生组成四个小组，到郊区蔬菜生产较有经验的产区，进行调查研究，将农民的实践经验提高到科学理论的水平，进行研究和总结。在工作过程中，他们首先拜农民为师，和农民一同生产劳动，虚心向农民学习生产技术，一起建立田头档案记录，进行系统的试验研究工作。现在，他们对秋种冬收蔬菜的总结工作已经结束，总结出了这个时期的主要蔬菜椰菜、菜心、玉豆等的增产经验，为提高教学提供了参考资料，写出了总结性的科学论文。
    现在，他们的研究成果如关于提高土地利用率和“隔畦、间作”等措施，已开始在广州郊区推广。通过这次总结工作，教师们在教学上的收获也很大。许多教师都认为把“死理论变成了活知识”。例如，有一位讲师过去只知道书本上说种玉豆要多浇水、多施肥，但却不知道在什么时候浇和浇多少才适当。在实际生产中，农民告诉他要在播种后的两天才浇水，不然豆种就会烂掉。他结合了科学理论进行研究，找出了这种做法的道理，原来是因为豆种萌发靠地下的湿气就够了，水多了，空气就会少，妨碍了豆种的呼吸，就容易烂掉。他们就是这样从实际生产中取得了许多活生生的材料，加以理论的分析，丰富了自己的知识，丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。例如，他们过去讲作物栽培时，只是照着课本讲，也不做实验，更谈不到田间生产。讲课的内容很不实际，采用外国和北方的材料多，引用南方和本地的材料少，教师只能讲不能做，学生们学起来感到生硬难记。这门课教了四、五年，都没有解决问题。现在他们到郊区总结蔬菜生产经验后，跟农民学到了生产上的实际经验和农业技术，现在不仅在讲课内容上充实了教材，克服了理论脱离实际的倾向，同时也可以指导学生从事农业生产，把教学与劳动生产结合起来。因此，他们最近订出的作物栽培教学大纲，就具体体现了理论讲授与生产实践相结合，课堂讲授与田间栽培相结合，生产劳动与科学研究相结合的教学原则。他们讲授的植物生理学，过去只把从书本上搬来的一套去贯彻米丘林学说，对于米丘林的理论总是体会得不深刻，讲起来生硬，这次到郊区总结蔬菜经验，和农民一起种试验田，从播种直到收获，经历了整个生产过程，不但摸到了植物生长发育的一般规律，同时也认识到植物有机体与外界的水、土、肥、光等生活条件与生长发育的密切关系，对米丘林的理论得到了深刻的了解，讲课时就用活生生的实践来印证了米丘林的生物有机体与外界环境条件统一的理论。
    目前，这个系的师生继续进行春种夏收蔬菜生产的总结工作，准备在国庆节前后把广州郊区一年四季的主要蔬菜的增产经验都总结出来。（黄成采）
    本报讯　中国农业科学院畜牧研究所畜牧科学工作组，在湖南长沙县望岳人民公社，结合生产从事畜牧科学研究工作，一年来取得了显著成绩。
    这个工作组，有畜牧、兽医、饲养管理等七名科学工作者。去年4月，他们到达公社后，首先以养猪场为基地，帮助公社解决生产中的问题，开展科学研究工作。他们帮助饲养员作人工授精，解决了种猪不足的困难。
    他们还根据当地饲养生猪的经验总结出“少吃多餐”的养猪方法，效果很好。在近一年中，这个工作组还帮助公社培养饲养员、配种员、兽医等五十多人。
