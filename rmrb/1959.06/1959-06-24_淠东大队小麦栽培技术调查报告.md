    Investigation Report on Wheat Cultivation Techniques in the Pidong Brigade
    Pidong Brigade Wheat Bumper Harvest Investigation Team
    Last year, the Pidong Brigade of the Pidong Commune in Luan County, Anhui Province, won the provincial red flag for large-scale, high-yield wheat production. This year, they have achieved even greater increases in production compared to last year. (Editor's note: According to a report in this newspaper on the 18th, the average yield of 1,501 mu of wheat threshed by the brigade has reached 831.5 jin per mu.) Recently, the Pidong Brigade Bumper Harvest Wheat Investigation Team, composed of relevant agricultural departments from the province, special district, and county, conducted an investigation into the high-yield wheat of this brigade.
    Dense Planting
    The density of wheat planting in the Pidong Brigade is determined by a sowing rate of 27 to 32 jin per mu in the fields, an increase of 7.2% compared to 1957. The highest sowing rate in the small dense planting experimental plots reached 250 jin, and the lowest was 20 jin.
    The sowing width is generally 4 to 5 inches, an increase of 80% in land utilization compared to the 2.5-inch width last year, with row spacing of 3 to 5 inches. The ratio of sowing width to row spacing is 1.1:1 for wide-row planting. Field observations indicate that the wide-row strip planting method with a 4- to 5-inch sowing width and 3- to 4-inch row spacing, or a 5- to 6-inch sowing width and 4- to 5-inch row spacing, is more suitable. The sowing width accounts for more than 50% of the sowing area on average, resulting in high land utilization. If the sowing width is too narrow, the wheat seedlings will be too crowded, leading to a high mortality rate and making it difficult to maintain a certain number of seedlings per mu. If the sowing width is too wide, although the land utilization area is large, the ventilation and light transmission between rows will be poor, which is not conducive to crop growth.
    From the growth of wheat seedlings with different sowing rates, it can be seen that the seedlings sown at 20 jin per mu are sparse, with thick and strong seedlings and many tillers, but they have not yet closed rows by the time of heading. The seedlings sown at around 30 jin are slightly sparse at emergence, grow vigorously, and gradually increase tillering, gradually closing the rows. The dense planting experimental fields sown at 45 jin or more per mu are densely grown and lush before the New Year, with deep green leaves covering the ground, showing a tendency to grow excessively. In the later stage, the stems are thin and weak, the lower leaves are yellow and withered, and the basal internodes are excessively elongated. Thinning was carried out two to three times during the seedling stage.
    The condition of plants on six plots of land with different sowing rates is shown in the table below:
    Comparison Table of Wheat Traits and Estimated Yields with Different Sowing Rates (calculated as an average of 25 plants)
    (Attached chart)
    Note: The estimated yield is calculated as follows: Total number of ears per mu × Number of grains per ear ÷ 15,000 grains.
    Fertilization
    Based on the "born rich" physiological characteristics of wheat, the Pidong Brigade adopted the method of applying sufficient base fertilizer in layers. Before plowing, miscellaneous fertilizers, smoked soil, and wall soil were applied and deeply tilled into the soil as "bottom fertilizer." Before sowing, watered manure was applied along the sowing width as "ditch fertilizer." After sowing, ash manure mixed with fine pond mud was used as "covering fertilizer." This method of concentrated and layered base fertilizer application is conducive to wheat roots absorbing sufficient nutrients from each layer of soil, meeting the needs for fertilizer throughout the entire growth period.
    In terms of topdressing, starting from the characteristics of the soil being sandy and having poor water and fertilizer retention, the "small and frequent meals" topdressing method was adopted. Topdressing was done twice before winter, once in the early stage of tillering, using watered manure or ammonium sulfate mixed with water; and a second time in the peak stage of tillering, using pond mud to press the wheat roots to promote tillering, consolidate the base, keep warm, prevent freezing, and ensure safe overwintering. After the spring, during the greening and jointing stages, watered manure, ammonium sulfate, and smoked soil were applied three to four times to strive for early spring tillering and ear formation, achieving more ears and plump grains. A topdressing of ash soil manure with a high phosphorus and potassium content was applied before heading, which not only promoted full grain filling but also prevented lodging. In terms of the amount of topdressing, in addition to the base fertilizer accounting for 26.5%, pre-winter topdressing accounted for about 36% of the total, and post-winter topdressing accounted for about 37.5%.
    During the growth process of wheat seedlings, special attention was paid to the Class III seedlings that were yellow and thin due to insufficient base fertilizer, and "interspersed fertilizer" was applied to them, so that the Class III seedlings grew rapidly, keeping the wheat seedlings uniform.
    In terms of fertilization principles, the "four observations" were flexibly mastered: 1. Observe the weather. Apply water fertilizer on sunny and dry days, combined with irrigation. Apply dry soil manure after rain, combined with flood prevention. 2. Observe soil properties. Apply more organic soil and miscellaneous fertilizer and pond mud to sandy soil, combined with soil improvement. 3. Observe the season. In winter, focus on slow-release fertilizers such as pressed wall soil and pond mud to keep warm and prevent freezing; in spring, focus on smoked fertilizer and fast-acting fertilizer to promote greening and consolidate tillering. In the early stage, focus on nitrogen fertilizer, supplemented by phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, and in the later stage, focus on phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. 4. Observe the growth of wheat seedlings. Apply less fertilizer to seedlings with normal color and vigorous growth, and apply more to weak and yellow seedlings to make the wheat seedlings grow evenly. This topdressing method is fully adapted to the local soil characteristics and wheat biological characteristics, and played a decisive role in increasing production and preventing lodging.
    Analyzing from the amount of fertilizer used, among the 640 dan (converted to net fertilizer) of fertilizer applied per mu, the proportion of various fertilizers is: smoked soil, wall soil, pond mud, stove soil, etc. account for 87% of the total, human and animal manure accounts for about 10.9%, and chemical fertilizer accounts for about 1.9%. These fertilizers are all complete fertilizers containing more nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The ratio of the three elements is 1.1:1:2.1. However, the sandy soil has poor water and fertilizer retention, and some of the fertilizer in the soil will be lost. Secondly, because the local irrigation system has not yet been formed, when the weather is dry and the soil moisture is low, some fertilizers cannot be dissolved in time for wheat to use.
    Deep Plowing
    All high-yield wheat plots in the Pidong Brigade were deep-plowed. 63% were plowed to a depth of 8 to 9 inches, 34.5% to a depth of one foot, and 2.5% to a depth of about two feet. Experimental fields were dug to a depth of three to five feet. The deep plowing methods are: 1. Double plowing; 2. Combining burning mounds with deep digging; 3. Using tractors for slow deep plowing. We investigated the relationship between five different degrees of deep plowing and wheat root development.
    The investigation shows that within a certain depth, deep plowing is directly proportional to the distribution range of the root system. As the depth of deep plowing increases, the number of secondary roots gradually increases. Developed root systems with a wide range can absorb more water and nutrients from the soil, which is conducive to the growth of above-ground parts. At the same time, because the roots are deep and firmly established, the support ability of the above-ground plants is increased, avoiding lodging; but the distribution of the root system does not expand indefinitely with the increase of the cultivated layer. Therefore, we believe that before the problem of deep plowing tools is solved, given the existing cultivation conditions and fertilization level, deep plowing to about one foot is appropriate.
    Seed Selection
    The Pidong Brigade has completely switched to improved varieties. In the past, local varieties such as "Gourd Head," "Qi Tou You," and "March Yellow" were used, which matured earlier, but the disadvantage was that they were not resistant to fertilizer, prone to lodging, and had low yields. Since 1953, the "Ai Li Duo" variety has been introduced, which has the advantages of being resistant to fertilizer, having hard stalks, being resistant to lodging, and having high yields, increasing production by about 50% compared to local varieties. Since 1957, all "Ai Li Duo" improved varieties have been selected. In order to change the situation of single improved varieties, the "Nan Da 2419" improved variety was also introduced in 1958. In addition to the characteristics of being resistant to fertilizer, having hard stalks, being resistant to lodging, and having strong resistance to stem rust, this variety is sown slightly later and matures later than "Ai Li Duo," which can regulate labor and solve the contradiction between concentrated farm work and insufficient labor. In 1958, early-maturing foreign wheat, Bi Ma No. 1, 407, and other varieties were also introduced for trial planting.
    The seed selection methods are field plant selection, ear selection, and grain selection. Through continuous seed selection over the years, the variety's traits and purity have been significantly improved. The seed purity in 1958 increased from 80% in the past to more than 95%. Before 1958, local wheat black smut and nematode disease plants were extremely serious, which had a great impact on yield. In the autumn planting of 1958, all seeds were selected by mud (salt) water, soaked in lime water, and mixed with 666 and Xilaisheng. This year, major diseases such as wheat black smut, nematode disease, and scab have been basically eliminated.
    The Pidong Brigade has also created a complete set of improved seed management system. That is, fixed improved seed plots, fixed personnel management, fixed threshing grounds, fixed warehouses, and fixed circle mats.
    Preventing Lodging
    1. Taking skillful fertilization as the key link, combined with a series of prevention-oriented measures such as seed selection, deep plowing, reasonable dense planting, and uniform sowing, the lodging barrier has been basically broken through.
    ① Skillful fertilization is the decisive factor in solving lodging. They accepted the lessons learned from the mistakes of using too much nitrogen fertilizer in the later period and topdressing too late last year, which caused 14.5% of the wheat fields to reduce production due to lodging. This year, due to the increase in the sowing amount and the increase in plants per unit area, improper fertilization is prone to lodging, and less fertilization will cause the wheat seedlings to wither and yellow. In response to this new situation, the "small and frequent meals" and "four observations" topdressing method was adopted. Generally, wheat fields were topdressed four to six times (except for key supplementary fertilization), and the most fertilizer was applied seven times. In this way, the nutrients needed for wheat growth can be continuously supplied, so that the above-ground and underground parts of wheat grow in a balanced manner. This year, the lodging area of ​​the entire team was only 3.4%, and it was concentrated in experimental fields with a high sowing amount, which is a significant achievement obtained after changing the topdressing method.
    We also observed the wheat growth in two dense planting experimental fields: one with a sowing amount of 48 jin per mu, with 678,300 ears, appropriate fertilization, and normal growth, and no lodging occurred; one with a sowing amount of 45 jin per mu (thinned by one-third), with 472,000 ears, and due to insufficient base fertilizer and excessive topdressing of nitrogen fertilizer, serious lodging occurred. This shows that in large-area high-yield fields, lodging can be prevented by appropriate topdressing within an appropriate sowing amount range.
    ② Appropriate dense planting: widening the sowing width and uniform sowing are one of the important factors for wheat not lodging. Last autumn, the wheat sowing amount was 27 to 32 jin per mu, with about 471,000 ears, less than one ear per square inch, and wide-row uniform strip planting, the plants maintain a certain distance, and a single plant has a certain nutritional area, which is conducive to ventilation and light transmission. Therefore, the wheat plants grow neatly and evenly, and the stems are hard, upright, and thick.
    ③ Universal deep plowing, deepening the cultivated layer, and promoting root development are effective measures to solve lodging.
    2. For those with excessive sowing, crowded wheat seedlings, or excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer, excessive growth of wheat seedlings, and a tendency to lodging, measures such as thinning, cutting leaves, wiping dew, building shelves, and topdressing with plant ash were taken to prevent it, and certain results were achieved. The Pidong Brigade cut off the leaves of 300 mu of vigorously growing wheat seedlings in mid-to-late March, inhibiting excessive growth, and the stems gradually returned to being thick and strong. Regarding the question of whether cutting leaves affects crop growth, the results of our field observation in four different leaf-cutting treatments show that there is no impact during heading, flowering, and grain filling.
    3. Regarding the rescue of lodging, the wheat in the Pidong Brigade suffered three attacks of force seven gales from late March to early May. About 3.4% of the wheat seedlings lodged. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the masses went all out, seized the sunny days after rain, and quickly helped up the lodged wheat seedlings to avoid rapid division of cells in the lower section, causing the wheat seedlings to bend and affecting normal growth.
    The experience of high-yield wheat in the Pidong Brigade is rich and colorful, and it is worthy of serious investigation and research. In addition to the above five cultivation technology issues, there are many more. For example, the land preparation has changed from the extensive cultivation of "high like a hill, low like a pond" to the meticulous cultivation of "the ground is as flat as a mirror, and the ditches are as straight as a line"; in terms of sowing, it has changed from broadcasting to strip sowing, creating a push seeder for uniform sowing; in terms of pest control, from the past severe diseases and insect pests, the main diseases and insect pests in the local area have been basically eliminated through a series of technical measures.
    Can the wheat yield in the Pidong Brigade continue to increase? The scientific research and technology group led by the brigade's Party branch believes that there is still potential to be tapped, mainly to attack "grandson ears" and fight for large and many ears, many and full grains. According to a typical survey of 28 wheat fields: those with 31 to 40 grains per ear accounted for 60%, those with 21 to 30 grains accounted for 28%, and those with 16 to 20 grains accounted for 12%. Secondly, according to archival data: after wheat sowing, there are 600,000 seedlings per mu, 860,000 seedlings in the jointing stage, and only 471,000 ears in the heading stage. If the cultivation technology is further improved and the original 600,000 seedlings can be maintained, and the number of grains in the "grandson ears" around 20 grains can be increased to more than 30 grains, then the increase in yield per unit area is still considerable. In the future, as long as sufficient base fertilizer is applied, an irrigation system is established, and lodging is completely prevented, the production increase target can be achieved.

    淠东大队小麦栽培技术调查报告
    淠东大队小麦丰产调查组
    安徽六安县淠东公社淠东大队去年获得了全省大面积高额丰产红旗，今年又比去年有更大的增产（编者注：据本报18日消息，该大队已经脱粒的一千五百零一亩小麦，平均亩产八百三十一斤半）。最近由省、专区、县有关农业部门组成淠东大队丰产小麦调查组，对这个大队的丰产小麦作了调查。
    密植
    淠东大队的小麦密植程度，确定大田播种量每亩二十七到三十二斤，较1957年增加7.2％；小块密植试验田的播种量最高的达二百五十斤，最低是二十斤。
    播种幅度，一般是四至五寸，较去年播幅二寸半增加土地利用面积80％，行距三至五寸。播幅与行距成1.1∶1的宽幅宽行。据田间观察，宽幅宽行条播方式以四至五寸播幅、三至四寸行距或五至六寸播幅、四至五寸行距比较合式。播幅平均占播种面积50％以上，土地利用率高。播幅过窄，麦苗过挤，死亡率高，难以保持每亩一定的苗数；如播幅过宽，土地利用面积虽大，但行间通风透光差，不利作物生长。
    从各种不同播种量的小麦苗期生长情况看：每亩播种二十斤的出苗稀，麦苗粗壮，发头多，但抽穗时尚未封行；播种三十斤左右的，出苗时略稀，生长茁壮，分蘖逐渐增加，幅沟逐渐封闭；播种四十五斤以上的密植试验田，年前生长密茂，叶色深绿，苗叶将盖满地面，有徒长现象，后期茎秆细弱，下部叶片枯黄，基部节间过分伸长，苗期曾进行了二至三次间苗。
    六块土地播种量不同的植株的情况，附表如下：
    播种量不同的小麦性状和预计产量比较表（以二十五株平均计算）
    （附图表）
    注：预计产量计算方法是每亩总穗数×每穗粒数÷15，000粒。
    施肥
    淠东大队根据小麦“胎里富”的生理特性，采取了分层施足基肥的方法。在整地前施用杂肥、熏土和墙土等，深翻入土做“铺底肥”；在播种前沿着播幅浇水粪做“垫沟肥”；播种后用灰粪拌细塘泥做“盖种肥”。这种集中分层施基肥的方法，有利小麦根系从各层土壤中吸取足够养分，满足整个生育时期对肥分的需要。
    追肥方面，从土壤砂性大，保水、保肥力较差特点出发，采用了“少吃多餐”的追肥方法。冬前追肥二次，一次在分蘖初期，用水粪或硫酸铵兑水浇施；二次在分蘖盛期，用塘泥压麦根，促进发棵盘墩，保温防冻，安全过冬。开春后，返青拔节阶段，追施水粪、硫酸铵和熏土三到四次，以争取早春分蘖成穗，达到穗多粒饱。孕穗前追施磷、钾含量较大的灰土粪一次，既能促使麦粒饱满，又能防止倒伏。在追肥数量上，除基肥占26.5％以外，年前追肥约占总数的36％，年后约占37.5％。
    在麦苗生长过程中，特别注意因基肥不足，生长黄瘦的三类苗，重点追施“插花肥”，使三类苗迅速生长，保持麦苗均匀一致。
    在施肥原则上，灵活地掌握了“四看”，即：一看天时。晴天地旱追水肥，结合灌溉；雨后追施干土粪，结合防涝。二看土壤性质。砂土地多施有机质土杂肥和沟塘泥，结合改良土壤。三看季节。冬季以压墙土、沟塘泥等慢性肥为主，保温防冻；春季以熏肥和速效性肥为主，促进返青，巩固分蘖。早期以氮肥为主，磷钾肥为辅，后期以磷钾肥为主。四看麦苗生长好坏。对苗色正常、生长健壮的少施，瘦弱发黄的多施，使麦苗均匀生长。这种追肥方法是完全适应当地土壤特点和小麦生物学特性，对增产和防止倒伏起了决定性的作用。
    从用肥量来分析，在每亩施肥六百四十担（折合净肥）中，各种不同的肥料的比例是：熏土、墙土、塘泥、灶土等占总用量的87％，人畜粪约占10.9％，化肥约占1.9％，这些肥料都是含氮、磷、钾较多的完全肥料。三要素的比例是1.1∶1∶2.1。但是土壤砂性大，保水保肥率差，土壤中的肥料多少要流失些。其次因当地灌溉制度尚未形成，在天气干燥，土壤水分较少时，部分肥料不能及时溶解为小麦利用。
    深耕
    淠东大队小麦丰产片，全部进行了深翻。深度八至九寸的占63％。一尺的占34.5％；二尺左右的占2.5％，试验田深挖三至五尺。深耕的方法是：一、套犁；二、烧包子结合深挖；三、用拖拉机慢速深耕。我们调查了五个不同深耕程度对小麦根系发育的关系。
    调查说明在一定的深度内，深耕与根系分布范围成正比例。随着深耕程度的加深，次生根数逐渐加多。根群发达，根系范围广，可以吸收土壤中更多的水分和养分，有利于地上部分的生长。同时因根深蒂固，增加了地上植株的支持能力，避免了倒伏；但根系的分布也不是随着耕层的增加，无限制的扩大。因此我们认为在深耕工具没有解决之前，就现有的耕作条件和施肥水平看，深耕一尺左右为适宜。
    选种
    淠东大队已经全部良种化。过去用的是“葫芦头”、“齐头蚰”、“三月黄”等当地品种，成熟期较早，缺点是不耐肥、易倒、产量低。从1953年开始引种“矮粒多”品种，优点是耐肥、秆硬、抗倒伏、产量高，比当地品种增产50％左右。1957年起全部选用“矮粒多”良种。为了改变良种单一化的局面，1958年又引种“南大2419”良种。这个品种，除了耐肥、秆硬、抗倒伏、抗秆锈病较强等特点外，它比“矮粒多”播种稍迟，成熟较晚，可以调节劳动力，解决农活集中与劳力不足之间矛盾。1958年还引进了早洋麦、碧蚂一号、四○七等品种，进行试种。
    选种的方法是田间株选、穗选、粒选。通过连年不断选种，品种的种性和纯度有了显著的提高，1958年种子纯度由过去的80％提高到95％以上。1958年以前当地小麦黑穗病和线虫病植株极为严重，对产量影响很大。1958年秋种时全部种子经过泥（盐）水选种、石灰水浸种和666、西力生拌种。今年小麦黑穗病：线虫病和赤霉病等主要病害基本消灭。
    淠东大队还创制了一套完整的良种管理制度。即固定良种田块、固定专人管理、固定晒场、固定仓库、固定圈席等办法。
    防止倒伏
    一、以巧施肥料为纲，结合选种、深耕、合理密植、播种均匀等一系列的防重于治的措施，基本上突破了倒伏关。
    ①巧施肥料是解决倒伏的决定因素。他们接受了去年后期施用氮肥偏多、追肥过晚的毛病，造成14.5％的麦田因倒伏而减产的教训。今年因播种量增加，单位面积植株加多，施肥失当容易倒伏，施肥少麦苗又枯黄。针对这一新情况，采用了“少吃多餐”分期“四看”追肥方法。一般麦地追肥四至六次（重点补肥除外），最多的施肥七次。这样就可以源源不断的供给小麦生育需要的养分，使小麦地上和地下部分均衡生长。今年全队倒伏面积仅3.4％，而且集中在播量多的试验田中，这是改变追肥方法后所获得的显著成绩。
    我们还观察了两块密植试验地的小麦生长情况：一块每亩播种量四十八斤，成穗六十七点八三万穗，施肥适量，生长正常，没有发生倒伏现象；一块每亩播种量四十五斤（间苗三分之一），成穗在四十七点二万穗，由于基肥不足，追施氮肥过多，发生了较严重的倒伏现象。这说明了大面积丰产田中在适当的播种量范围内追肥适当倒伏是可以防止的。
    ②适当密植：加宽播幅、均匀播种是小麦不倒的重要因素之一。去秋小麦播种量每亩二十七至三十二斤，成穗在四十七点一万穗上下，每平方寸不到一个穗头，而且宽幅均匀条播，植株保持一定距离，单株有一定的营养面积，又利于通风透光，因此，小麦植株生长整齐均匀，秆硬直立粗壮。
    ③普遍深耕，加深耕作层，促进根系发育是解决倒伏的有效措施。
    二、对于播种过密，麦苗过挤或因施氮肥过多，麦苗徒长，有倒伏趋势的，采取了间苗、割叶、抹露水、搭架、追施草木灰等措施加以预防，都收到一定效果。淠东大队对三百亩疯长的麦苗，分别于3月中、下旬割去叶片，抑制了徒长，茎秆逐渐恢复粗壮。关于割叶是否影响作物的生育的问题，我们在四块不同的割叶处理的田间观察的结果，抽穗、扬花、灌浆期间并无影响。
    三、关于抢救倒伏方面，淠东大队小麦在3月下旬到5月上旬，先后遭受三次七级狂风的袭击。约有3.4％的麦苗倒伏。党总支领导群众全力以赴，抓紧雨后晴天，尽快地把倒伏麦苗扶起，不致因低面节部细胞迅速分裂，造成麦苗弯曲，影响正常生长。
    淠东大队小麦丰产经验是丰富多采的，值得认真调查研究的。除上面五个栽培技术问题以外，还有很多。如整地方面由“高似岗、洼似塘”的粗放耕作，改变成“地平如镜、沟直如线”的精细耕作；在播种方面从撒播改为条播，创造了均匀播种的推播器；在灭虫方面，从过去病虫害严重，经过一系列的技术措施，基本上消灭了当地的主要病虫害。
    淠东大队小麦产量能不能继续提高呢？大队党总支领导的科学研究技术小组，认为还有潜力可挖，主要是向“子孙穗”进攻，为穗大穗多、粒多粒饱而战。据二十八块麦地典型调查：每穗粒数三十一至四十粒的占60％，二十一至三十粒的占28％，十六至二十粒占12％。其次从档案资料看：小麦播种后每亩出苗六十万苗，拔节期是八十六万苗，成穗期只有四十七点一万穗。如果在栽培技术上，继续提高一步，能保持原来六十万苗；将二十粒上下的“子孙穗”粒数增加到三十粒以上。这样单位面积产量的提高还是可观的。今后只要施足基肥，建立灌溉制度，彻底防止倒伏，增产指标是可以实现的。　（原载安徽日报，有删节）
