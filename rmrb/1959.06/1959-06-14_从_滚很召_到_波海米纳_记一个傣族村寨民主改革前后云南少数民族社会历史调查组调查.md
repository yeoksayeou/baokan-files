From "Gun Hen Zhao" to "Bo Hai Mi Na"
    —A Record of the Survey by the Yunnan Minority Social History Investigation Group Before and After the Democratic Reform of a Dai Village

    "Gun Hen Zhao"—The Lord's Slaves

    "Manlie" is a Dai village in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province. Before liberation, it had fifty households, all of whom raised elephants for "Zhao Pian Ling" (meaning the lord of vast lands), the largest landlord in Xishuangbanna. People contemptuously called this village "Gun Hen Zhao" (meaning the lord's slaves), and the lord disparagingly called them "Pipa Ghosts," saying that whoever touched them would be unlucky, so they could not live with other Dai people. The whole village had only two hundred mu of land, and most families lived by selling their labor. This meager income had to bear all kinds of heavy feudal exploitation. In addition to raising elephants for the great landlord "Zhao Pian Ling" without compensation on a rotational basis, every household had to pay half a "kai" (a local silver coin in Yunnan before liberation, equivalent to 50 cents in silver dollars) or 1.5 yuan whenever Zhao Pian Ling held religious sacrifices. When getting married or divorced, they had to pay a marriage or divorce fee of 10 to 15 yuan to Zhao Pian Ling. Building a thatched house required paying a tax of 1.5 yuan to the landlord, and building a tiled house required paying a tax of 4.5 yuan. Reclaiming wasteland required paying a tax of 1 yuan. Whenever farmers in the village hunted wild animals, they had to give half to Zhao Pian Ling, and the best animal skins and antlers were all given as gifts; new households moving into the village had to offer a chicken, a pot of wine, and half a "kai" (1.5 yuan) to the headman of the village before they could live there. In addition, they had to bear the reactionary Kuomintang government's public grain, cattle tax, and household donations, with each household bearing at least about 40 yuan per year. The farmers described the exorbitant taxes at that time as "innumerable as hairs." Under this cruel exploitation, production naturally could not develop. Also, due to the lack of means of production, farmers had to work for the lord most of the time, so they had to plant extensively but harvest little. They only plowed the fields two or three inches deep and never applied fertilizer. Every year, they had to wait until July or August, relying on rainfall to transplant rice seedlings. On average, each mu of paddy field produced 200 jin of rice. On average, each person in the whole village had only 40-odd jin of grain, and grain-deficient households accounted for 68% of the total number of households. Because of the poverty, many people were sick, and there were no medical and health facilities. When they got sick, they had to ask witch doctors to sacrifice to gods and send away ghosts. The mortality rate was high, and the population declined year by year.

    "Bo Hai Mi Na"—Masters of the Land

    After liberation, the reactionary Kuomintang government's exorbitant taxes were abolished, and the People's Government gave the farmers in this village a lot of support and assistance. However, because the oppression of the feudal lord system continued to exist, the roots of poverty were not eradicated. By 1955, before the land reform, grain-deficient households still accounted for 52% of the total number of households in the village. Therefore, abolishing the feudal system and completely eradicating the roots of poverty became the urgent demand of all Dai farmers in the village.

    In 1956, the Party led the Dai people of Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture in carrying out land reform through peaceful consultation. The slaves of Manlie Village were liberated from the feudal lord system that had been oppressing the Dai people for eight hundred years. On average, each person was allocated more than two mu of land, and they were freed from the lord's unpaid labor and various privileges and exploitation. The previously despised "Gun Hen Zhao" became the respected "Bo Hai Mi Na" (meaning masters of the land).

      Organize and Prosper Together

    Although they were allocated the land they had longed for for generations and gained personal freedom, they still felt the lack of means of production such as plowing cattle and farm implements, and there were still some difficulties in developing production. At this time, the Party pointed out a path for them: organize and achieve common prosperity through mutual aid and cooperation. In 1957, the poor farmers in the village first established mutual aid teams. Last year, they formed an agricultural production cooperative of thirty-six households. This year, an unprecedented upsurge of production was launched in the Dai villages of Xishuangbanna. On water conservancy construction sites and in the fertilizer accumulation campaign, Manlie Village cooperated with Dai farmers in other villages. The entire autonomous prefecture built water conservancy for 260,000 mu of fields in one spring, more than double the total water conservancy irrigation area of the prefecture in the hundreds of years before liberation. Through this movement, the Dai people of Manlie Village clearly saw that the strength of one village was still limited, so after the autumn harvest, they jointly established people's communes with other villages.

    In just over two years after the land reform, the production of Manlie Village developed vigorously like the rising sun and blooming spring flowers. The backward farming techniques of extensive planting and low yields were abandoned, and the Dai people created and adopted nearly a hundred new production tools. They also changed the habit of never applying fertilizer, and in 1958, they applied an average of 13,400 jin of fertilizer per mu. Due to the construction of new canals and the abolition of feudal water regulations, all 472 mu of fields in the village were irrigated, and the cultivation season was advanced. Plowing the fields was changed from two or three inches in the past to seven or eight inches, and measures such as close planting and seed selection were also adopted. A large number of women broke through the historical division of labor between men and women in the Dai ethnic group. For example, poor peasant woman Yu Yinhan broke the legend that "the Han people are afraid of tigers, and the Dai people are afraid of human manure," took the lead in carrying manure to the fields, and jointly created a manure spreading machine with three other women. Eight Dai women broke the superstition that "women plowing the fields will be struck by lightning" and learned to plow the fields. In 1958, the average yield per mu in the village reached 420 jin, more than double that of 1952, and the average person had more than 940 jin of grain. Cash crops and sideline production also developed comprehensively. In 1958, the income from planting sugar cane, peanuts, and fruits and raising pigs, chickens, and ducks in the village totaled more than 2,500 yuan. The miserable days of poor farmers eating wild vegetables and bamboo shoots to fill their stomachs are gone forever, and they have begun a happy life of abundance.

  Changes in Yan Maijie's Family

    Yan Maijie was a farm laborer before the land reform. In 1952, the total income of his family of three was only more than 51 yuan, with an average of only 17 yuan per person. This year, the whole family lacked eight months of food and relied on finding wild vegetables to survive. The family had nothing but a broken thatched house and an earthen pot for cooking. This year, he also borrowed five yuan to barely cope with the feudal lord's exorbitant demands. In 1956, Yan Maijie was allocated land, and then he became a member of the mutual aid team and a member of the agricultural cooperative, and his life completely changed. In 1958, the family increased to five people, and the total income from farming, sideline occupations, and handicrafts reached more than 210 yuan, with an average income of more than 40 yuan per person, nearly double that of 1952. In addition, after the land reform, the heavy exploitation of the feudal lord was eliminated, and most of the income was used to improve the family's life. This year, the family of five received 2,400 jin of grain, which was relatively abundant. Each person had a new set of clothes, and a new bamboo building was built. The home was no longer "bare walls," and many daily necessities such as quilts, sheets, washbasins, porcelain bowls, shoes, and flashlights were added. There were also savings throughout the year. The changes in Yan Maijie's family are just an epitome of the lives of more than 40 Dai farmers in Manlie Village.

    从“滚很召”到“波海米纳”
    ——记一个傣族村寨民主改革前后云南少数民族社会历史调查组调查
    “滚很召”——领主的家奴
    “曼烈”是云南边疆西双版纳傣族自治州的一个傣族村寨，解放前有五十户人家，都替西双版纳最大领主“召片领”（意为广大土地之主）养象。人们鄙视地称这个寨子为“滚很召”（意为领主的家奴），领主则侮蔑他们为“琵琶鬼”，说谁碰着就会倒霉，所以不能跟其他傣人住在一起。全寨只二百亩田，大半人家靠卖工过活。这样低微的收入，还要负担各种繁重的封建剥削。全寨人民除无偿地轮流替大领主“召片领”养象外，每逢召片领举行宗教祭祀，每户要出半开（解放前云南的一种地方银币，相当于银元五角，下同）一元五角。结婚、离婚时，要向召片领交纳结婚或离婚费十到十五元。盖草房一间，向领主纳税一元五角，盖瓦房一间纳税四元五角。开荒地要纳税一元。凡寨内农民猎获野兽，要拿一半献给召片领，最好的兽皮、鹿茸等，全作献礼；新迁到寨里的住户，要向住寨的头人献一只鸡、一壶酒，半开一元五角，才能居住。此外，还要负担国民党反动政府的公粮、牛税、门户捐等，每年每户至少负担四十元左右。农民形容那时的苛捐杂税“像头发一样数不清”。在这种残酷的压榨下，生产自然无法发展。还由于生产资料缺乏，农民大部分时间要为领主服役，只好广种薄收，田只耕两三寸深，从不施肥，每年要等到七、八月间，靠天下雨才能栽秧，平均每亩水田产稻谷二百斤。全寨平均每人只有四十来斤粮食，缺粮户占总户数的68％。因为生活贫困，生病的人多，又没有医药卫生设施，生了病只好请巫婆祭神送鬼，死亡率高，人口逐年下降。
    “波海米纳”——土地的主人
    解放后，国民党反动政府的苛捐被取消了，人民政府对这个寨的农民作了许多扶持和帮助。但是，由于封建领主制度的压迫继续存在，贫穷的根根没有挖掉，到土地改革前的1955年，缺粮户仍占全寨总户数的52％。于是，废除封建制度、彻底挖掉穷根，就成为全寨傣族农民的迫不及待的要求。
    1956年，党领导西双版纳自治州的傣族人民进行了和平协商的土地改革，曼烈寨的家奴，从压在傣族人民头上达八百年的封建领主的制度下解放出来了。平均每人分得二亩多田地，并摆脱了领主的无偿劳役和各种特权剥削，过去被人鄙视的“滚很召”变成了受人尊敬的“波海米纳”（意为土地的主人）。
      组织起来，共同富裕
    他们虽然分得了世代渴望的土地，获得了人身的自由，但是耕牛、农具等生产资料仍然感到缺乏，在发展生产中还存在若干困难。这时，党给他们指出了一条道路：组织起来，通过互助合作达到共同富裕。就在1957年，寨里的贫苦农民首先成立了互助组。去年又组成了一个三十六户的农业生产合作社。这一年，西双版纳的傣族农村里掀起了史无前例的热火朝天的生产高潮。在水利工地上，在积肥运动中，曼烈寨都同其他村寨的傣族农民实行协作。全自治州在一个春天就修了二十六万亩田的水利，超过解放前几百年全州水利灌溉面积的一倍多。通过这一运动，曼烈寨的傣人又清楚地看到，一村一寨的力量仍然是有限的，在秋后就同其他寨共同办起了人民公社。
    土地改革后不过两年多时间，曼烈寨的生产像旭日东升、春花怒放一样蓬勃地发展着。广种薄收的落后耕作技术被抛弃了，傣人创造和采用了近百种新的生产工具。也改变了从不施肥的习惯，1958年平均每亩施肥一万三千四百斤。由于修了新的水渠和废除了封建水规，全寨四百七十二亩田得到灌溉，耕作季节提早了。耕田由过去耕两三寸改变为耕七八寸，还采用了密植、选种等措施。大批妇女突破了傣族历史上的男女分工界限。如贫农妇女玉银罕，打破了“汉族怕老虎，傣人怕人粪”的传说，带头挑粪下田，并和另外三个妇女共同创制了撒粪机。八个傣族妇女破除了“妇女犁田会遭雷打”的迷信，学会了犁田。1958年全寨平均每亩产量达到四百二十斤，比1952年提高了一倍多，平均每人有粮九百四十多斤。经济作物和副业生产也全面发展起来了，1958年全寨种甘蔗、花生、水果和养猪、鸡、鸭的收入共达二千五百多元。贫苦农民吃野菜、竹笋充饥的悲惨日子已经一去不复返，开始了丰衣足食的幸福生活。
  岩卖杰一家的变化
    岩卖杰在土地改革前是雇农，1952年全家三口人只收入五十一元多，平均每人只有十七元。这年全家缺八个月的口粮，靠找野菜等度日，家中除一间破草房和烧饭的土锅外，别无它物。这一年还借了五块钱的债才勉强应付过封建领主的苛索。1956年岩卖杰分得了土地，随后又成了互助组员和农业社员，日子就完全变样了。1958年，全家增加到五口人，农副业和手工业收入共达二百一十多元，每人平均收入四十多元，比1952年增加将近两倍，加上土地改革后免除了封建领主的繁重剥削，收入中绝大部分都用来改善全家的生活。这一年，全家五口人分得二千四百斤粮食，吃得比较充裕，每人缝了一套新衣，新盖了一座竹楼，家中已经不再是“家徒四壁”了，添了被子、床单、脸盆、磁碗、鞋子、电筒等许多日用品。全年还有节余。岩卖杰家庭的变化，只不过是曼烈寨四十多户傣族农民生活的一个缩影。
