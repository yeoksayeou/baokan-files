Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd, Geneva dispatch: The plenary session of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference on the 2nd continued to discuss the Berlin issue, with Gromyko presiding.

The first to speak at the meeting was the Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz. He said that the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the time has come to completely end the occupation regime on German soil. It is urgent to do so, especially because West Berlin has become a dangerous source of trouble seriously endangering the peace of Germany and the peace of Europe. Bolz listed a series of facts proving that West Berlin has become a center for implementing provocative policies against the German Democratic Republic and its neighboring countries. Bolz said that the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the solution to the West Berlin issue should achieve one goal: to eliminate the danger of provoking war caused by the provocations of German militarists in West Berlin.

Bolz pointed out that Berlin is an area under the sovereign jurisdiction of the German Democratic Republic, and the most thorough solution is to eliminate the occupation regime in West Berlin and merge West Berlin with the democratic area of Berlin, both under the sovereign jurisdiction of the German Democratic Republic. He continued that the German Democratic Republic's efforts to peacefully resolve the issue are based not only on legal principles, but also primarily and mainly on the actual situation in Berlin. The government of the German Democratic Republic has carefully and meticulously studied the Soviet government's proposal to transform West Berlin into a demilitarized free city and has concluded that these proposals must be supported. Once West Berlin becomes a free city, the atmosphere can be clarified and international tensions eased, creating great possibilities for the normalization of relations between the German Democratic Republic and West Berlin, and for improving relations between the two parts of Berlin.

Bolz emphasized that after West Berlin becomes a free city, the German Democratic Republic is willing to provide economic assistance, resolve various issues for West Berlin based on the interests of the residents of West Berlin, and ensure the unobstructed traffic of West Berlin with the outside world. He also announced on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic that it is willing to conclude a guarantee treaty through a declaration guaranteeing the inviolability of the status of West Berlin as a demilitarized free city and the city's free contact with the outside world. This declaration can also be filed with the United Nations. Bolz concluded by saying that since the draft Soviet peace treaty has already stipulated the transformation of West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, concluding such a peace treaty is the best way to solve the West Berlin issue. In any case, eliminating the danger arising from the abnormal situation in West Berlin is an urgent task that must be completed.

Next, Grewe, the representative of the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany, spoke. A large part of his speech was a repetition of hackneyed arguments against accepting the Soviet proposal for concluding a peace treaty with Germany. That part of his speech concerning the Berlin issue also lacked anything new or positive, although he repeatedly said that his delegation supported methods of bringing views closer together. Grewe's entire speech showed that the West German government's attitude has only one purpose: to prevent the foreign ministers from bringing their views closer together on the issues under discussion, and to prevent them from finding ways to make the solution of these issues conform to the national interests of the German people and the task of ensuring European peace.

Gromyko then spoke.

Gromyko focused on analyzing the proposals of the Western three governments on the Berlin issue. He pointed out that the Western three powers' proposals on Berlin contained in the so-called "package plan" do not help in the slightest to find a mutually agreed solution to the Berlin issue. Gromyko continued that on May 26, U.S. Secretary of State Herter elaborated on the U.S. government's position on the Berlin issue in more detail than in his speech on May 14. Unfortunately, this speech cannot but be disappointing. This speech can only strengthen the view that the Western three governments still adhere to a position that cannot provide any basis for reaching an agreement.

Gromyko then analyzed the seven-point plan on the Berlin issue put forward by Herter in that speech. Gromyko said that the first point of the Western plan unreservedly stipulates taking East Berlin away from the German Democratic Republic and merging it with West Berlin into a "unified and indivisible region" under the joint occupation and management of the four powers. In this first point of the Western plan, it is also proposed that the four powers, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, should prescribe procedures for Berliners to conduct city-wide elections, establish municipal management agencies, and formulate a Berlin constitution, all of which would be carried out under foreign occupation. The second point of the plan clearly stipulates that, regardless of the elections, referendums, and Berlin constitution mentioned in the Western plan, the four powers have the right not only to maintain as many troops as they wish in the city, but also to enjoy all the privileges of the occupiers. Gromyko continued that the other points in the Western plan were also permeated with this spirit.

The head of the Soviet delegation emphasized that, as can be seen, the Western plan before us is a broad, carefully formulated plan to permanently maintain the foreign occupation regime in West Berlin and even expand it to East Berlin. Gromyko asked, can this plan be regarded as showing an effort to find a mutually agreed solution to the Berlin issue? Gromyko pointed out that Soviet Premier Khrushchev had already stated very clearly and frankly a few days ago that there are "no factors for negotiation in the Western plan. This proposal is not based on the wishes of the people of all countries, who hope to find the correct solution to achieve the easing of international tension that all people expect."

Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet government is sincerely committed to seeking a mutually agreed solution to the Berlin issue, and a fair and solid solution would be possible if the solution to the Berlin issue took into account the legitimate rights of the German Democratic Republic. Gromyko refuted the fallacy that the German Democratic Republic had not accepted any entrustment other than accepting the entrustment of the Soviet Union. He said that this statement is untenable. The Soviet Union has completely transferred to the German Democratic Republic the rights and functions it exercised as an occupying power in East Germany in the past. In September 1955, the Soviet Union concluded a treaty with the German Democratic Republic, according to which the Soviet Union relinquished all rights restricting the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, both diplomatically and internally. For example, there are no provisions in this treaty stipulating the deprivation of the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic in matters related to the unification of Germany or Berlin, but everyone knows that there are such provisions in the Paris Agreement concluded between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Western countries. Thus, even from a purely legal point of view, the treaty between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic excludes the possibility of the Soviet Union granting the German Democratic Republic any "full power" or "entrustment power."

Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet Union proposes to negotiate on the solution of the Berlin issue on the basis of conforming to the interests of all parties and without causing damage to the security and prestige of any country. In view of the opposition from the United States, Britain, and France to the proposal for the withdrawal of the troops of the three countries from West Berlin, the Soviet government has put forward two supplementary proposals for resolving the issue of foreign troops in West Berlin in order to formulate a mutually acceptable agreement on the Berlin issue. We can agree that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union station a certain number of symbolic troops in West Berlin. Since the Western three governments attach great importance to the stationing of foreign troops in West Berlin, it seems that they should not object to such a solution to the Berlin issue. If there is a genuine desire for negotiation, this proposal should be a compromise satisfactory to all parties. Another possible solution to this issue is for a limited number of troops from neutral countries to replace the troops of the United States, Britain, and France in West Berlin.

In conclusion, Gromyko drew attention to the speech made by Grewe, the representative of the Federal Republic of Germany, at the meeting that day. The head of the Soviet delegation pointed out that Grewe's speech confirmed the correctness of the view that the policy of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is a heavy burden on the participants of the Geneva Conference.

Lloyd then made a brief speech, and the meeting then adjourned.

    葛罗米柯在外长会议上重申谋求协议立场
    提出解决西柏林问题补充建议
    可由美英法苏或中立国在西柏林驻扎一定数目军队
    博尔茨代表德意志民主共和国提出
    愿给西柏林自由市经济帮助
    保证它同外界交通畅通无阻
    新华社3日讯  据塔斯社日内瓦讯：日内瓦外长会议2日的全体会议继续讨论柏林问题，由葛罗米柯担任主席。
    在会上首先发言的是德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨。他说，德意志民主共和国政府认为，完全结束德国土地上的占领制度的时刻已经来到了。所以迫切需要这样做，尤其是因为西柏林已经变成了一个严重地危害着德国和平和欧洲和平的危险的策源地。博尔茨列举一系列的事实证明，西柏林已经成为执行反对德意志民主共和国及其邻国的挑衅政策的中心。博尔茨说，德意志民主共和国政府认为，西柏林问题的解决应当达到一个目的：消除由于德国军国主义者在西柏林的挑衅而产生的挑起战争的危险。
    博尔茨指出，柏林是德意志民主共和国主权管辖下的一个地区，最彻底的解决办法是消除西柏林的占领制度，使西柏林同柏林民主区合并，同处在德意志民主共和国主权管辖之下。他继续说，但是，德意志民主共和国和平解决问题的努力不仅以法律原则作根据，而且首先和主要的是以目前柏林存在的实际情况为基础的。德意志民主共和国政府认真而仔细地研究了苏联政府关于把西柏林变为非军事化自由城市的建议，并得出结论，认为必须支持这些建议。当西柏林成为自由城市以后，就可以澄清气氛和缓和国际紧张局势，可以为德意志民主共和国和西柏林的关系正常化，为改进柏林两个部分之间的关系创造巨大可能性。
    博尔茨着重指出，在西柏林成为自由城市以后，德意志民主共和国愿意在经济上给以帮助，根据西柏林居民的利益为西柏林解决各种问题，保证西柏林同外界的交通畅通无阻。他还代表德意志民主共和国政府宣布，愿意缔结一项保证条约，通过一个保证西柏林的非军事化自由城市的地位不受侵犯和这个城市同外界自由联系的宣言。这个宣言也可在联合国备案。博尔茨最后说，由于在苏联提出的对德和约草案中已经规定把西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市，所以缔结这样的和约就是解决西柏林问题的最好途径。无论如何，消除由于西柏林的不正常局势而产生的危险已经是必须完成的迫切工作。
    接着德意志联邦共和国代表团代表格雷韦发言。他的发言很大一部分都是重弹滥调，反对接受苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议。他的发言中关于柏林问题的那一部分也没有任何新的、积极的东西，虽然他口口声声说他的代表团支持使观点接近的方法。格雷韦的全部发言表明，西德政府采取的态度只有一个目的：不让外长们在所讨论的问题上的观点接近起来，不让他们找到办法使这些问题的解决符合德国人民的民族利益和保障欧洲和平的任务。
    葛罗米柯接着发言。
    葛罗米柯着重分析了西方三国政府关于柏林问题的建议，他指出，包含在所谓“一揽子计划”之中的西方三大国关于柏林的建议，丝毫不能有助于求得大家一致同意的解决柏林问题的办法。葛罗米柯接着说，5月26日美国国务卿赫脱比他在5月14日的发言更详细地阐明美国政府关于柏林问题的立场。遗憾的是，他这次发言不能不令人感到失望。这次发言只能使人加强了这种看法：西方三国政府依然坚持那种对达成协议不能提供任何基础的立场。
    葛罗米柯然后分析了赫脱在那次发言中提出的关于柏林问题的七点计划。葛罗米柯说，西方计划的第一点不折不扣地规定了把东柏林从德意志民主共和国夺走，并把它同西柏林一起并成一个四大国共同占领管理的“统一的不可分割的地区”。在这个西方计划的第一点中还提出，由美、苏、英、法四国给柏林人规定进行全市选举、建立市政管理机构和制定柏林宪法的程序，而这一切又是要在外国占领的条件下进行。在计划的第二点中明明白白地规定，可以不顾西方计划中所提到的选举、公民投票和柏林的宪法，四大国有权不仅在这个城市内保留它们随心所欲的数量的军队，而且享有占领者的一切特权。葛罗米柯接着说，西方计划中的其他各点也同样贯穿着这种精神。
    苏联代表团团长着重指出，可见，摆在我们面前的西方计划是一个广泛的、制订得很仔细的、要把外国对西柏林的占领制度永久保持下去并且还要把它扩大到东柏林的计划。葛罗米柯问道，难道能把这个计划看作是表明努力使柏林问题获得一致同意的解决办法的吗？葛罗米柯指出，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在前几天已经极其明确和坦率地说明，西方的计划中“没有任何可供谈判的因素。这种建议没有以各国人民的愿望为基础，各国人民希望找到正确的解决方法来达到全体人民所期待的国际紧张局势的缓和。”
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联政府真诚地致力于寻求一致同意的办法来解决柏林问题，如果柏林问题的解决考虑到德意志民主共和国的合法权利，那就可能是一个公正的巩固的解决办法。葛罗米柯驳斥了所谓德意志民主共和国除了接受苏联的委托以外，没有接受任何别的委托的谬论。他说，这种说法是站不住脚的。苏联已将它过去作为占领国在东德行使的权利和职能完完全全地移交给德意志民主共和国了。1955年9月，苏联同德意志民主共和国之间缔结了一项条约，根据这项条约，苏联放弃了一切限制德意志民主共和国主权的权利，无论在外交上或内政上都是如此。譬如，这个条约中没有那些条文规定剥夺德意志民主共和国在有关统一德国或柏林的问题方面的主权，然而大家知道，在德意志联邦共和国同西方国家缔结的巴黎协定中是有这种规定的。可见，即使从纯粹法律观点来看，苏联同德意志民主共和国之间的条约也排除了由苏联给予德意志民主共和国以任何“全权”或“委托权”的可能性。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，苏联建议在符合各方利益和不会给任何一个国家的安全和威信带来损失的基础上，就解决柏林问题进行协商。鉴于美国、英国和法国方面反对关于三国军队由西柏林撤出的建议，苏联政府为了就柏林问题拟定一个彼此可以接受的协定，又提出了解决西柏林外国军队问题的两个补充建议。我们可以商定美、英、法三国和苏联在西柏林驻扎一定数目的象征性军队。既然西方三国政府很重视在西柏林驻扎外国军队，那么，看来，它们不应当反对这样解决柏林问题。如果真正有谈判愿望的话，这个建议应该是一个使各方面满意的折衷建议。解决这个问题的另一个可能的方案，是由中立国家的有限额的军队来代替美国、英国和法国在西柏林的军队。
    葛罗米柯在发言的最后提请注意德意志联邦共和国代表格雷韦在当天会上的发言。苏联代表团团长指出，格雷韦的发言证实了这种看法的正确性：德意志联邦共和国政府的政策是加在日内瓦会议参加者身上的重担。
    接着劳埃德作了简短的发言，会议然后休会。
