    The June sun shines overhead,
    Commune members are weeding on the hills,
    For the sake of a great increase in grain production,
    They don't care if their clothes are soaked with sweat.
    The mountains are full of corn like bamboo forests,
    The weeders form groups,
    The wind blows the corn into colorful waves,
    Only corn is seen, not the people.
    The June sun burns like fire,
    Commune members are weeding with high spirits,
    Weeding and topdressing are done conscientiously,
    Every cornstalk carries two ears.

    株株包谷背双包
    六月太阳当头照，
    社员薅草在山岗，
    为了粮食大增产，
    那管汗水湿衣裳。
    满山包谷像竹林，
    薅草人儿连成群，
    风吹包谷结彩浪，
    只见包谷不见人。
    六月太阳似火烧，
    社员薅草劲头高，
    除草追肥认真搞，
    株株包谷背双包。
