The Main Directions of Automation in the Chemical Industry

Editor's Note: Prior to the convocation of the Central Committee of the CPSU on June 24th, the Soviet press organized a series of articles around the issues to be discussed at the plenary session, examining the Seven-Year Plan and technological progress. This is an article written by Festa, Chief Engineer of the Automation Experimental Design Bureau of the State Chemistry Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, published in the "Pravda" on May 16th. Excerpts are translated below:

Comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes are the primary and decisive means of ensuring technological progress in the national economy. On this basis, it is possible to further increase labor productivity, reduce costs, and improve product quality. Therefore, industrial workers and scientists are very pleased to learn that the Central Committee of the CPSU will convene a plenary session to review the implementation of the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on this issue.

The chemical industry, due to large-scale production, the inability to directly observe continuous production processes, and the harmful and explosive nature of the processed substances, requires comprehensive mechanization more than other sectors.

Experience shows that automation of chemical production processes has significant economic benefits and pays for itself in a very short period. For example, after the automation of the acetic acid regeneration workshop at the Vladimir Chemical Plant, labor productivity increased by 45%, and production costs decreased by 15%, so all the expenses for automation were fully recovered in two and a half months. It is particularly cost-effective to adopt automation in newly built factories. New chemical enterprises should first of all be distinguished from old enterprises by the high degree of mechanization and automation of production processes.

Now, the automation of chemical production processes should achieve the goal of ensuring the stability of the technological process according to technical requirements by means of automatic regulators that keep the basic parameters of the production process (temperature, pressure, quantity, and composition, etc.) constant.

However, under this automation system, the economic effect of production almost entirely depends on the correctness of selecting the technological regime (maintained by the automatic regulator). In modern chemical equipment, when production conditions change, determining the best, that is, the most economically advantageous production regime, is an extremely difficult task. The rapidly developing technology of manipulating the production process based on the use of computational control devices in recent years has opened up avenues for solving this task.

There are no examples in the world practice of using mathematical machines to control chemical production. Many related scientific and engineering technical problems are currently under study. However, the exploration of this issue has reached such a degree that guaranteeing the establishment of an automation system that guides the production process under the most economically advantageous regime is not only a completely realistic task, but also the most important direction for the development of automation in chemical production in the coming years.

This new automatic regulator has been developed and tested in practice. It can find and maintain the best regime itself.

The Seven-Year Plan stipulates the high-speed development of mathematical machine production, thus creating practical possibilities for the widespread use of calculation technology in the automation of chemical production. Adopting mathematical control machines is the second step in this regard. These machines can obtain information from inspection and measurement instruments and transform the information into command orders according to the proposed program.

Another important direction for the development of automation in chemical production is the transition from the automation of individual technological processes to the comprehensive mechanization and automation of the entire factory.

The work currently being carried out in the automation of basic technological processes guarantees a huge surge in labor productivity. However, a large reduction in the number of personnel has not been achieved. The reason is that the number of people manipulating the production process in the main workshops is not large, while about 80% of the staff of chemical plants are engaged in auxiliary and management work.

Under the conditions of fundamentally improving working conditions and raising the level of production culture, the automation of repair work and loading and unloading work can greatly increase labor productivity. The use of computers for planning and statistical production can not only greatly streamline management personnel, but also greatly improve the effectiveness of enterprise management.

The mechanization and automation of auxiliary work is one of the most urgent tasks of chemical industrial enterprises. It is precisely this sector, which was lagging behind not long ago, that should receive special attention in the Seven-Year Plan.

In order to accumulate experience, it is appropriate to build several experimental comprehensively automated factories in the coming years.

Here, I would like to talk about several important issues related to the realization of the chemical industry's huge automation program stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan, first of all, the arrangement of scientific research work and experimental design work.

Obviously, it is necessary to drastically expand the scientific research front in the comprehensive automation of chemical production. In addition, the transition to the comprehensive automation of chemical production also requires fundamentally reorganizing the existing organizational forms of scientific research work. Reorganizing the organizational forms of scientific research work is related to greatly changing production processes and the equipment used, and improving the production organization system. It is not accidental that people often call production automation a new industrial revolution. When establishing comprehensively automated production, scientific research work in automation cannot be separated from the work of formulating production processes.

It is very important to correctly organize experimental work and implement automation in chemical plants.

Experience shows that, in order to ensure the completion of the program for accelerating the development of the chemical industry on the basis of comprehensive mechanization and automation, the role and sense of responsibility of enterprises in implementing production mechanization and automation should be enhanced. It is also necessary to formulate measures to promote the concern of enterprise staff for the most effective mechanization and automation of basic and auxiliary production processes.

The completion of the chemical industry automation program largely depends on the development of the instrument industry. The shortage of instruments and automation tools has so far hindered the development of chemical production automation. In the next seven years, the chemical industry's need for instruments and automation tools will increase more than seven times.

Establishing a unified national instrument system is of decisive significance in developing the domestic instrument manufacturing industry. The unification and standardization of the specifications of the instrument parts can greatly reduce the design work of the automation system and make the use of the automation system much simpler. We believe that this measure is extremely important and urgent and needs to be resolved rapidly, because adopting this system can save the country billions of rubles.

### 化学工业自动化的主要方向

    化学工业自动化的主要方向
    编者按：在苏共中央于6月24日召开全会之前，苏联报刊围绕着全会将要讨论的问题，组织了一系列研究七年计划和技术进步问题的文章。这是苏联部长会议国家化学委员会自动化实验设计局总工程师费斯塔写的一篇，登载在5月16日“真理报”上面。摘译如下：
    生产过程的综合机械化和自动化，是保证国民经济技术进步的主要的、决定性的手段，在这个基础上能够进一步提高劳动生产率，降低成本和改进产品质量。正因为如此，所以当工业工作者和科学家们知道苏共中央将召开全会检查苏共第二十一次代表大会关于这个问题的决议的执行情况时，表示非常满意。
    化学工业由于大规模生产，由于不能对连续不断的生产过程进行直接观察，由于加工物质的有害性和爆炸危险，因此比其他部门更需要全盘机械化。
    经验表明，化工生产自动化具有极大的经济效果，并且在很短时期内就会收回成本。例如，弗拉基米尔化学工厂的醋酸再生车间实行生产自动化以后，劳动生产率提高了45％，产品成本降低了15％，因此为自动化所花的一切费用在两个半月之内全部收回。在新建设的工厂中采用自动化特别合算。新的化工企业首先应该以生产过程高度机械化和自动化而区别于老企业。
    现在化工生产过程自动化要达到这样的目的，即根据技术要求，借助使生产过程基本参数（温度、压力、数量和成分等）保持不变的自动调节器来保证工艺过程的稳定。
    可是在这种自动化系统下，生产的经济效果差不多完全取决于选择工艺制度（由自动调节器所保持的）的正确程度。在现代化工设备中，当生产条件有了改变，决定最好的、也就是经济上最有利的生产制度是一个极为困难的任务。最近几年来迅速发展的、以利用计算的操纵装置为基础的操纵生产过程的技术，为解决这个任务开辟了途径。
    在世界实践中还没有用数学机器来操纵化工生产的例子。许多与此有关的科学和工程技术问题目前都在研究阶段。可是对这个问题的探讨已达到这样的程度：保证建立能在经济上最有利的制度下指导生产过程的自动化系统已经不仅是一个完全现实的任务，而且是今后几年在化工生产上发展自动化的最重要的方向。
    这种新的自动调节器已经制成并且在实践中加以检验，它自己能发现和保持最好的制度。
    七年计划中规定要高速发展数学机器生产，从而为在化工生产自动化方面广泛利用计算技术创造了实际的可能性。采用数学操纵机器是这方面的第二步，这种机器可以从检查测量仪器那里获得情报，并且根据所提出的纲领把情报变为指挥号令。
    在化工生产上发展自动化的另一个重要方向就是从个别工艺过程的自动化过渡到整个工厂的全盘机械化和自动化。
    现在在基本工艺过程自动化方面进行的工作，保证了劳动生产率的巨大高涨。可是大大减少人员数量却没有达到。原因是在主要车间中操纵生产过程的人数不多，而化学工厂的工作人员约有80％从事辅助工作和管理工作。
    在根本改善工作条件和提高生产文化水平的条件下，修理工作和装卸工作的自动化可以大大提高劳动生产率。采用计算机来计划和统计生产，不仅可以大大精简管理人员，同时也将大大提高企业管理的效能。
    辅助工作的机械化和自动化是化学工业企业一个最迫切的任务。正是这个不久前还是落后的部门应该在七年计划中得到特别的重视。
    为了积累经验，在今后几年内建设几座试验性的全盘自动化工厂是合宜的。
    在这里谈谈几个同实现七年计划规定的化学工业自动化的巨大纲领有关的重要问题，首先谈谈科学研究工作和实验设计工作的安排问题。
    显然，必须在化学生产全盘自动化方面急剧扩大科学研究阵线。此外，向化工生产全盘自动化过渡还需要根本改组科学研究工作的现有组织形式。改组科学研究工作的组织形式是同大大改变生产工艺程序和所用设备，同改进生产组织系统有关。人们常常把生产自动化称做新的工业革命，这不是偶然的。在建立全盘自动化生产时不能把自动化方面的科学研究工作同拟订生产工艺过程的工作分开来。
    正确地组织实验工作和在化学工厂中实行自动化是很重要的。
    经验证明，为了保证完成在全盘机械化和自动化的基础上加速发展化学工业的纲领，应该提高企业在实行生产机械化自动化方面的作用和责任感。还需要拟订一些措施来促进企业工作人员去关心使基本生产过程和辅助生产过程实行最有效的机械化和自动化。
    完成化学工业自动化纲领在很大程度上决定于仪器工业的发展。仪器和自动化工具的不足，直到现在还阻碍着化工生产自动化的发展。在最近七年内，化学工业在仪器和自动化工具方面的需要将增加七倍以上。
    建立统一的全国仪器系统，在发展本国仪器制造业方面具有决定性的意义。仪器各部分的规格统一和标准化，可以大大减轻自动化系统的设计工作，并且使得利用自动化系统大大简便。我们认为，这种措施极为重要和迫切，需要急速解决，因为采用这种系统可以为国家节约几十亿卢布。
