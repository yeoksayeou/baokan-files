Further Improve the Work of Cultivating and Educating the New Generation

Our great socialist motherland is advancing by leaps and bounds. The Chinese children, who are known as the flowers of the motherland, are also thriving under the nurturing of the Party and the state.

1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward in all our construction undertakings. In this year, China's children's education cause achieved unprecedented development. The number of primary school students reached more than 86 million, an increase of 34% compared with 1957. The development of preschool education was even faster, with more than 30 million children entering kindergartens, an increase of more than twenty-seven times compared with 1957. Nurseries have also greatly developed in the process of the people's communes, with more than 47 million children admitted. Encouraged by the overall Great Leap Forward situation in the motherland, and influenced and inspired by the new social ethos and new moral qualities that are growing among the people of the whole country, the new morality and new qualities of our children are also growing rapidly. Loving the motherland, loving the collective, studying diligently, and loving labor have become the basic characteristics of the spiritual outlook of our children.

China's hundreds of millions of children are the successors to our country's construction of socialism and the transition from socialism to communism, and the future great army of builders of communism. The work of cultivating and educating the new generation is an important part of our socialist construction cause.

In order to enable the young people and children to truly shoulder the task of successors to the cause of communism in the future, we must first continuously educate them with the spirit of communism. This is a specific and meticulous work. Not only must young people and children know what socialism and communism are, but also must young people and children resolutely safeguard the interests of the state and the public in their lives, refrain from doing things that harm or hinder socialist construction, and understand that they must firmly and bravely fight against the enemy and various bad phenomena in society. Educating children with the spirit of communism is also a long-term task. As the new generation grows one after another, and the progress of the motherland changes with each passing day, it is necessary to constantly, patiently, and repeatedly cultivate the communist spirit and morals of young people and children through concrete things. This is a very important task and cannot be relaxed in the slightest.

Nurseries and kindergartens are the bases for cultivating successors to the cause of communism, and will have a profound impact on the healthy physical and mental development of young children. At present, after considerable development in kindergartens and nurseries, attention should be paid immediately to consolidating and improving them, and effectively running them well. Play is the main lesson for young children. Through play, they can exercise their physique, cultivate their will, and acquire knowledge. Therefore, the content of kindergarten games should be well chosen. Primary schools are for the basic education of young people and children, and middle schools continue this part of the work. Therefore, middle schools and primary schools, especially primary schools, shoulder a particularly important responsibility in the cause of cultivating the new generation. In recent years, under the guidance of the Party's educational policy of cultivating children in an all-round way, young people and children have made great progress in moral, intellectual, and physical education. Over the past year, in the combination of education and productive labor, the collectivism and labor concepts of young people and children have been further cultivated, and their physical fitness has been enhanced. All these achievements have been achieved under the condition of fully grasping the characteristics of young people and children for education. In the future, it is necessary to continue to consolidate and develop the achievements that have been made, and in the teaching work of primary and secondary schools, do everything possible to improve the consciousness of young people and children in reading, and guide young people and children to read carefully; it is also necessary to continue to adhere to the planned selection of light and short-term labor suitable for the physical strength and interests of young people and children, and pay attention to the combination with teaching in labor, and use the knowledge learned in practice through labor, while constantly enriching their basic knowledge. Therefore, schools must pay attention to comprehensively arranging students' reading, cultural and sports activities, labor and rest, and cultivate young people and children into people with socialist consciousness, culture, and love of labor.

The Young Pioneers is a communist organization for young people and children. The Young Pioneers plays an important role in cultivating the initiative, enthusiasm, creativity, and independent working ability of young people and children. Over the past year, the work of the Young Pioneers has developed vigorously. Through various activities of the Young Pioneers, the ideological awareness of young people and children has been greatly improved, a conscious attitude towards learning has been established, and a habit of loving labor has been cultivated, making young people and children more concerned about the construction and future of the motherland. In order to better exert the role of the Young Pioneers organization, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels must lead the Young Pioneers well, suit the age characteristics of young people and children, and make the work of the Young Pioneers more meticulous, deeper, and more lively.

Nursery workers, educators, teachers, counselors, and all children's workers shoulder the glorious and arduous task of cultivating successors to communism. As we commemorate the annual "June 1st" Children's Day, we should express our gratitude and congratulations to them for the great achievements they have made and the arduous work they have put in over the past year. We hope that they will further improve their political awareness, ideological level, conscientiously study the Party's educational policy, improve their professional level, and earnestly and meticulously do their work well, and live up to the great trust and earnest expectations of the Party and the state. Party organizations and government departments at all levels should take good care of them and help them continuously improve their political and professional level. In particular, for the large number of nursery workers and educators, they should be given short-term training courses, lectures, and other forms to enable them to quickly improve their professional skills. At the same time, cultivating and educating the new generation is also the responsibility of the whole society. Therefore, it is also hoped that all sectors of society will be concerned about the development and growth of young people and children, and that writers, artists, and scientists will create more and better works that excite the minds of children. In particular, the quality of picture books that are loved by children should be effectively improved so that they can better play an educational role. Families and parents have an educational responsibility for their children. Parents should not only care about children's lives and make them physically strong, but also care about their thoughts and studies. The influence of the family on children is very great. Because children have a strong ability to imitate, parents should especially set an example and be a good example for their children.

Our motherland is in an era of rapid development. Our various undertakings, including children's care and education, are also developing rapidly. Looking back on the past, we are full of joy and confidence; looking forward to the future, we see unparalleled brilliance. China's hundreds of millions of children, under the close care of the Party and the state, have infinitely bright prospects. Let us work together to earnestly develop the education cause and cultivate China's new generation into outstanding successors to the cause of communism!

    把培养教育新一代的工作提高一步
    我们伟大的社会主义祖国在飞跃前进。被称为祖国的花朵的我国少年儿童，也正在党和国家的抚育下，蓬蓬勃勃地成长起来。
    1958年是我国各项建设事业大跃进的一年，在这一年中，我国的儿童教育事业有了空前的发展。小学生已达到八千六百多万人，比1957年增加了34％，幼儿教育的发展更快，入幼儿园的儿童达到三千多万，比1957年增加了二十七倍多。托儿所在人民公社化的过程中，也有了很大发展，入所儿童已达四千七百多万人。在祖国全面大跃进形势的鼓舞下，在全国人民群众中日渐成长着的新的社会风尚、新的道德品质的影响和启示下，我国儿童的新道德、新品质也在迅速成长。热爱祖国，热爱集体，勤学习，好劳动，已成为我国儿童精神面貌的基本特征。
    我国亿万儿童，是我国建设社会主义以及由社会主义向共产主义过渡的接班人，是未来的共产主义的建设大军。培养、教育新的一代的工作，是我国社会主义建设事业的重要部分。
    为了使少年儿童将来真正能够担负起共产主义事业接班人的任务，我们首先应该不断用共产主义的精神来教育他们。这是一件具体细致的工作。不仅要使少年儿童知道什么是社会主义和共产主义，而且也要使少年儿童在生活中坚决维护国家的和公共的利益，不做损害和妨碍社会主义建设的事情，懂得要坚定地勇敢地同敌人以及社会上各种不良现象作斗争。用共产主义精神教育儿童，又是一个长期的工作。新的一代相继地成长，祖国的进步日新月异，必须不断地耐心地反复地通过具体的事物培养少年儿童共产主义精神和品德。这是一件十分重要的工作，不可丝毫放松。
    托儿所和幼儿园是培养共产主义事业接班人的基地，对幼儿身心的健康发展将发生深远的影响。目前，在幼儿园和托儿所已经有了相当发展后，应该立即注意巩固和提高，切实把它办好。游戏是幼儿的主要功课，通过游戏可以锻炼他们的体格，培养意志，获得知识。因此，幼儿园的游戏内容应当很好选择。小学是对少年儿童进行基础教育的，中学也继续着这一部分的工作，所以，中学和小学、特别是小学，在培养新的一代的事业中，担负着特别重要的责任。几年来，在党的培养少年儿童全面发展的教育方针指导下，少年儿童在德育、智育、体育方面都有了很大的提高。一年来，在教育和生产劳动结合中，进一步培养了少年儿童的集体主义和劳动观点，增强了体质。所有这些成绩，都是在充分掌握了少年儿童的特点进行教育的情况下取得的。今后，必须继续巩固和发扬已得的成就，在小学、中学的教学工作中，千方百计地提高少年儿童的读书自觉性，引导少年儿童认真读书；还要继续坚持有计划地选择适合少年儿童体力和兴趣的轻微的短时间的劳动，并在劳动中注意同教学结合，通过劳动使所学的知识用于实际，同时不断丰富他们的基础知识。因此，学校必须注意全面安排学生的读书、文化体育、劳动和休息，把少年儿童培养成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化、爱劳动的人。
    少年先锋队是少年儿童的共产主义组织。少年先锋队在培养少年儿童的主动性、积极性、创造性和独立工作的能力等方面，具有重要的作用。一年来，少年先锋队工作有了蓬勃的发展，通过少年先锋队的各项活动，大大提高了少年儿童的思想觉悟，树立了自觉的学习态度，培养了热爱劳动的习惯，使少年儿童更加关心祖国的建设和未来。为了更好地发挥少年先锋队组织的作用，各级共青团组织必须带领好少年先锋队，适合少年儿童的年龄特点，把少年先锋队的工作做得更细致、更深入、更生动活泼。
    保育员、教养员、教师、辅导员和一切儿童工作者，担负着培养共产主义接班人的光荣而又艰巨的任务。在我们一年一度纪念“六一”儿童节的时候，对于他们过去一年中作出的巨大成绩，付出的艰巨劳动，应当表示感谢和祝贺。希望他们更进一步提高政治觉悟、思想水平，认真学习党的教育方针，提高业务水平，切切实实、认真细致地把自己的工作作好，不辜负党和国家的巨大信任和殷切期望。各级党的组织和政府部门，应该很好地关心他们，帮助他们不断提高政治业务水平。特别是对为数众多的保育员、教养员，应该通过组织短期训练班、讲座等形式，使他们迅速地提高业务能力。同时，培养、教育新的一代，也是全社会的责任，因此也希望社会各方面都来关心少年儿童的发展和成长，希望作家、美术家和科学家，为孩子们创作出更多更好的激动儿童心灵的作品，特别是对于受儿童喜爱的小人书，应该切实提高质量，让它更好地发挥教育作用。家庭和父母对孩子负有教育责任。父母不但要关心儿童生活，使儿童身体健壮，而且要关心他们的思想和学习。家庭对孩子的影响是很大的，由于儿童摹仿性强，父母尤其应该以身作则，给儿女作个好榜样。
    我们祖国正处在飞跃发展的时代。我们的各项事业，包括儿童保育教育事业，也在一日千里地发展。回顾过去，我们充满了愉快和信心；瞻望将来，我们眼前更是无比的光辉灿烂。我国亿万儿童，在党和国家的亲切关怀下，有着无限光明的前途。让我们共同努力，切切实实发展教育事业，把我国新的一代培养成为优秀的共产主义事业接班人！
