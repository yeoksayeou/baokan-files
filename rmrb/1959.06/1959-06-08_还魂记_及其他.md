    “The Return of the Soul” and Others
    Tian Han
    The Jiangxi Provincial Classical Opera Troupe's performance in Beijing has brought us the ancient and beautiful Yiyang, Qingyang, Gan, and Hui operas, as well as a refreshed version of Tang Xianzu's famous play, "The Peony Pavilion: The Return of the Soul."
    In early April, when I visited Nanchang, my old friend Ling He invited me to see several important opera genres in Jiangxi (unfortunately, I didn't get to hear Qingyang Opera), and also the Yiyang Opera version of "The Return of the Soul." Because two years ago (1957) marked the 340th anniversary of Tang Xianzu's death, many opera troupes from both north and south have performed Tang's works since the previous year, especially "The Return of the Soul." In Beijing, we saw performances of "The Peony Pavilion" by the Northern Kunqu Opera Theatre and the Kunqu Opera Research Society. The scenes of Chunxiang's Mischief in School and The Garden Stroll and The Interrupted Dream from "The Peony Pavilion" are also frequently performed by Peking Opera troupes, and Mei Lanfang's "The Garden Stroll and The Interrupted Dream" is a popular excerpt, but a full-length performance is very rare. This was the first time I personally saw it.
    Tang Xianzu's play not only expresses progressive ideas and magnificent talent, but also demonstrates repeated, precise, and meticulous consideration of structure and rhythm. He was a contemporary of the great English playwright Shakespeare. Shakespeare died in 1616, and Tang Xianzu died in 1617, only one year after Shakespeare. Tang's most famous plays are the Four Dreams: Zichai, Handan, Nanke, and Huanhun. He was a person who dared to fight against the corrupt rule of his time, and therefore suffered repeated accusations, demotions, and oppressions. Finally, he seized this neglected form of opera to express his lonely indignation. If dreams are a symbol of human suffering and ideals, then Tang Xianzu was a person who dared to dream. He used his "dreams" to attack the corrupt and ugly officialdom of his time, to pour out the people's pain, and, like "The Return of the Soul," to resist the feudal ethics that prevented and harmed the happiness of young people from the perspective of the suppressed young men and women of the time. Du Bao thought he loved his daughter, but even after Liniang's revival, when Liu Mengmei traveled thousands of miles to be with her, he still tortured Mengmei and prevented them from being together. Shi Linghe, the "retranslator" of "The Return of the Soul," said:
      "Du Liniang was born into an official family and raised in seclusion. She was severely constrained by ethics, but she pursued beautiful ideals with life and death. Without love, life is worse than death; with love, even death can be overcome."
    Tang Xianzu grasped this thing that was stronger than death, which is why his work has been outstanding for thousands of years. Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" also writes about the beauty and profound love in the world. Du Liniang and Juliet have the same feelings of self-pity and sadness for spring. Juliet's experience is a tragedy, while Du Liniang's ends in a comedy after going through hardships, but the purity, firmness, and unwavering nature of their emotions are truly unique in their own ways.
    The original "Return of the Soul" is more difficult and obscure, not only is it rarely performed, but even if it is performed, it is difficult for today's young audiences to fully understand it. Ling He's adaptation of this play into Yiyang Opera not only transforms the original into a lively and modern language, but also clarifies and enriches it. Let's take the "Dream Seeking" section as an example:
    Original: (Lazy Eyebrows) [Dan] The most alluring spring color is this year. What is missing to paint the wall with high and low powders? It turns out that the heart of spring flies everywhere. (Stumbling gesture) Alas, sleeping roses grab the skirt threads, it is like flowers pulling at people's hearts.
    Adapted: (Down the Mountain Tiger) Spring colors year after year, spring colors year after year, the most alluring is this year. Look at the flowers blooming and falling in the spring garden, rouge of thousands of points. Sleeping roses pull at the skirt threads, it is like flowers pulling at the beauty with a smile. Obviously, the adaptation is easier to understand and more vivid than the original.
    This play ends with the flower goddess congratulating Liniang's revival and meeting Mengmei. All the scenes after "Revival" have been deleted. Comrade Ling He believes that this way "the conflict of the plot is resolved. If the subsequent details are retained, it would undermine the theme." I don't object to tightening the scenes to better meet today's requirements. In fact, the original play had thirty-five scenes before "Revival," which have now been reduced to eleven. But to say that "the conflict of the plot has been resolved" seems to oversimplify the conflict. Du Liniang only wandered in the garden and was startled, sought dreams without a trace, and died of sorrow and depression on autumn night. They did not encounter any specific or sharp obstacles. Therefore, I advocate strengthening the Dream Seeking scene, letting Mengmei also seek dreams and come to the garden, encounter Liniang, and just as they are about to speak, they are startled and dispersed by Du Bao, who forbids Liniang from going to the garden again. Wouldn't that be more specific?
    I also don't think that famous works like "The Peony Pavilion" should only be performed unchanged, "not a single word should be altered." Europeans also make deletions to Shakespeare's plays when performing them, let alone adaptations. But it is necessary to adopt a more cautious attitude towards the original and preserve its best chapters and sentences as much as possible. Comrade Ling He has set a good example in this regard. But I also want to offer a small suggestion. For example, the "Zao Luo Pao" in The Interrupted Dream, "Crimson and purple bloom everywhere, all given to broken wells and ruined walls..." is a passage that everyone sings with great enjoyment. I don't think it is appropriate to change "rain silk and wind fragments, misty painted boats" to "willow silk and flower fragments, misty painted boats." "Willow silk and flower fragments" also do not match the context of "misty painted boats" in the following text. Also, the "embroidered screen person" in "the embroidered screen person despises this beautiful time" does not need to be changed to "rich person." The people can still see the composition of the "embroidered screen person."
      The performance of "The Return of the Soul" deserves great praise. First of all, it is a very simple matter for the veteran Yiyang Opera artists to incorporate Comrade Ling He's translated lyrics so appropriately and powerfully into the Yiyang Opera tunes. The band's playing technique is also very good, and some comrades in Beijing who work on stage scenes are very impressed.
    It is also very fortunate that Yiyang Opera has excellent actors like Pan Fengxia and Tong Qingren. Whether or not actors are good is related to the success or failure of the opera genre, and good actors are not easy to cultivate. This requires society to cherish these actors, and the actors also cherish themselves with a high sense of responsibility.
    In this play, Du Liniang's singing is the most demanding, and Comrade Pan Fengxia has been able to persevere tirelessly. She also cooperated well with the innocent little girl who played Chunxiang. If there is still something lacking, it is that the sections on Startled Soul, Seeking Soul, and Lamenting Death are not clearly distinguished enough in the performance and are a bit "flat." If she can carefully understand the development of the character's emotions, it will be even more perfect.
    On April 16th of this year, Comrade Ling He and I returned from Ruijin to Nanchang, and on the way, we passed through Linchuan and touched the "Tang Family Jade Tea Garden" stone tablet and visited Mr. Tang Xianzu's tomb. The stele leaned against the wall of a store, and the tomb was next to a vegetable market. There was a couplet written by Jiang Lutang on both sides of the tombstone: "His writing surpasses the seas, his integrity crowns Linchuan." A little further away was a mu of lotus pond, although there were short walls and weak willows, it was not without a sense of desolation. Compared to the grand and rich commemoration of that playwright in Shakespeare's hometown, it is much worse. I suggest building some pavilions and gardens on the original site of the Jade Tea Garden or next to the tomb to commemorate this playwright who lived three hundred and forty-two years ago, which can also be visited and commemorated by cultural and drama circles from both inside and outside the province, and even from home and abroad.
    When visiting the tomb of this predecessor playwright, I wrote a few poems and copied them here:
      Rain and wind pass Linchuan,
      Inviting young people to worship at the tomb.
      Don't say that dream traces cannot be found,
        "Return of the Soul" newly enters Yiyang string.
      Take the song stage as the battlefield,
      What Mr. excels at is not just writing?
      Ten years, ten swords sharpened into the day,
      Revisit the Tang Family Jade Tea Garden.
      How is Du Liniang compared to Juliet,
      Their deep love has truly reached the roots.
      When should beautiful sentences be locked in pavilions and gardens,
      Not letting Shakespeare have a village of his own.

    “还魂记”及其他
    田汉
    江西省古典戏曲演出团入京演出，给我们带来了古老优美的弋阳腔、青阳腔、赣剧、徽剧，也给我们带来翻新了的汤显祖名剧——牡丹亭还魂记。
    4月上旬我访南昌的时候，老友凌鹤同志邀我看了江西的几个重要剧种（就可惜没有听到青阳腔），也看了弋阳腔化了的“还魂记”。由于二年前（1957）是汤显祖逝世的三百四十周年纪念，前年以来南北剧团较多演出汤氏作品，特别是“还魂记”。在北京我们就看到北方昆剧院和昆剧研究社的“牡丹亭”演出。“牡丹亭”的春香闹学、游园惊梦诸折在京剧剧团也是经常演的，梅兰芳同志的“游园惊梦”更是大家喜好的折子戏，但全本演出就十分难能可贵了。我个人还是第一次看到。
    汤显祖此剧不只是表现了进步的思想，富丽的才华，于结构音律也做了再三反复精严细缜的推敲。他是和英国大剧作家莎士比亚同时的，莎士比亚是1616年逝世，汤显祖是1617年逝世，仅后莎士比亚一年。汤氏的剧作最有名的是紫钗、邯郸、南柯、还魂四梦，他是一位敢于跟当代腐败统治斗争的人，因此迭遭参谪压抑，最后抓住这一不被重视的戏曲形式来抒写他的孤愤。倘使梦是人类苦闷和理想的象征，那么汤显祖正是敢于做梦的人。他用他的“梦”来攻击当时的腐败丑恶的官场，倾吐人民的痛苦，也像“还魂记”那样，从当时被压抑的青年男女的立场反抗杜渐防微坑害青年幸福的封建礼教。杜宝是自以为疼爱女儿的，但他在丽娘复活以后，柳梦梅千里相投，他还是拷打梦梅不让他们结合的。“还魂记”的“改译者”石凌鹤同志说：
      “杜丽娘生于宦门，长在深闺，她被礼教约束甚严，但对美好的理想却是生死追求，没有爱生不如死，有了情虽死可复生。”
    汤显祖正是抓住了这一比死还要强的东西，才使他的作品卓绝千古。莎士比亚的“罗米欧与朱丽叶”同一写人间的美丽深远的情爱，杜丽娘与朱丽叶伤春自怜有同一感情，朱丽叶的遭遇是悲剧，杜丽娘经历波查之后以喜剧结束，但感情的纯真坚定生死不渝，真是各有千秋。
    “还魂记”原作较为艰深，不只演得少，纵然能演出也很难被今天的青年观众所透彻理解。凌鹤同志把此剧改成弋阳腔演出，不止把原作化成近于现代的生动活泼的语言，也有所阐明丰富。随便举“寻梦”的一段做例子吧：
    原作：（懒画眉）〔旦〕最撩人春色是今年。少什么低就高来粉画垣，元来春心无处不飞悬。（绊介）哎，睡荼?抓住裙衩线，恰便是花似人心好处牵。
    改译：（下山虎）春色年年，春色年年，最撩人却是今年。你看这花谢花飞春苑，胭脂千万点。睡荼?扯住裙绦线，恰便是花似伊人带笑牵。显然改译的比原作更好懂些了，也更生动些了。
    此剧演到花神祝贺丽娘回生与梦梅相见为止，“回生”以后各折都删去了。凌鹤同志认为这样“剧情的矛盾便解决了。如果保留以后的枝节反而冲溃了主题。”我不反对把场子紧缩得更符合今天的要求些。实则“回生”以前原剧有三十五折现在缩成十一折了。但若说“剧情矛盾已经解决”，似乎矛盾过于简单空泛了。杜丽娘只是游园惊魂，寻梦无痕，秋夜忧伤抑郁而死，他们并没有碰到什么具体的尖锐的阻碍。因而我主张把寻梦加强，让梦梅也寻梦来到花园，与丽娘邂逅，刚要交言，便被杜宝惊散，不许丽娘再到花园，这样是不是较为具体些？
    我也不以为“牡丹亭”之类的名著，只许原封不动，“不应乱易一字”；欧洲人演莎士比亚也是有所删削的，何况是改译。但对原作采取更慎重的态度，尽量保存它的佳章佳句是必要的。凌鹤同志在这一点做了很好的范例。但也要提一点小意见。如惊梦的“皂罗袍”原来姹紫嫣红开遍，似这般都付与断井颓垣……一阕是人人唱得口角生香的句子。我觉得把“雨丝风片，烟波画船”，改成“柳丝花片，烟波画船”就不恰当，
  “柳丝花片”也与下文“烟波画船”的情境不合。又“锦屏人忒看的这韶光贱”的“锦屏人”也不必改为“富贵人”，人民对“锦屏人”的成份还是看得出的。
      “还魂记”的演出值得大大赞颂一番。首先是弋阳腔老艺人能把凌鹤同志的译词那样恰当有力纳入弋阳腔的牌子就是一桩很不简单的事。乐队的演奏技术也非常之好，一些本京搞场面的同志就非常佩服。
    弋阳腔拥有潘凤霞、童庆礽等这样优秀的演员也是十分值得庆幸的。演员出得好不好，关系剧种的成败，而好演员又很不容易培养。这要求社会上爱惜这些演员，演员们也以高度责任感爱惜自己。
    这个戏杜丽娘的唱最繁重，潘凤霞同志能够始终不懈地坚持下来。她跟那位去春香的天真无邪的小姑娘也配合得很好。倘使还有着不足的话那便是惊魂，寻魂，悼殇三折的表演上段落还分得不够清楚，还有点“平”。倘能细细体会人物感情的发展就会更臻完美了。
    今年4月16日我和凌鹤同志们由瑞金回南昌，路过临川曾抚过“汤家玉茗堂”石碑，谒过汤显祖先生的墓。碑靠着一家商店的墙边，墓在菜场边，墓碑两侧有江吕棠书联云：“文章超海内，品节冠临川。”稍远有一亩藕塘，虽有短垣弱柳不无荒凉之感，比起莎士比亚的故乡纪念那位剧诗人的隆重丰富，那就差得多了。我建议就玉茗堂原址或墓边建一些池馆，纪念三百四十二年前的这位剧作家，也可以供省内外甚至国内外文化戏剧界瞻仰凭吊。
    谒这位先辈剧作家墓的时候写了几首诗抄在这里：
      雨丝风片过临川，
      邀得青年拜墓田。
      莫道梦痕无觅处，
        “还魂”新入弋阳弦。
      直把歌场作战场，
      先生何止擅文章？
      十年十剑磨成日，
      再访汤家玉茗堂。
      杜丽何如朱丽叶，
      情深真已到梅根。
      何当丽句锁池馆，
      不让莎翁有故村。6月3日（附图片）
