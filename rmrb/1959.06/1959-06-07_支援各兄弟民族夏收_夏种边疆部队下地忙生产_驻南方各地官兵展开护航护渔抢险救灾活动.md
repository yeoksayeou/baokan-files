Xinhua News Agency, June 6th – People's Liberation Army troops stationed in regions such as Tibet, Yunnan, and Xinjiang are actively assisting local ethnic minority peoples in their production labor during the current busy summer production season. Garrison troops in the Lhasa area of Tibet have organized large numbers of personnel and material resources to help Tibetan compatriots with summer cultivation and planting. The tractors and sowing machines of the "August 1st" farm are also speeding across the fields of the Lhasa River valley, supporting Tibetan compatriots in their production. The PLA units stationed in the Shannan area are using every spare moment to help Tibetan compatriots accumulate and transport fertilizer, plow fields, and plant seeds. A unit, led by its commanders, organized a labor force of more than 160 soldiers to transport over 30,000 jin of fertilizer for Tibetan compatriots in the Zedang area, and dispatched warhorses to help with plowing. The Tibetan compatriots joyfully said: "The People's Liberation Army has sown the seeds of happiness for us and planted the roots of auspiciousness!"

Troops stationed in the Mengzi area of Yunnan Province recently organized a "Support the Masses in Rice Transplanting Shock Brigade" of more than 100 soldiers, led by their commanders, to support ethnic minority peoples in rice transplanting. They worked more than ten hours a day from morning to night, fighting continuously for seven days, transporting more than three million jin of fertilizer, and transplanting rice, repairing field ridges, and weeding corn on more than 100 mu. Soldiers of a unit stationed in the Simao area contributed more than 6,500 workdays, helping the Kawa and Lahu peoples with their summer harvest and planting, and vigorously supported the construction of the Mengbang Reservoir project. In addition to helping ethnic minority peoples cut hillside land, dig fields, reclaim wasteland, harvest rapeseed, plant corn, plant sugarcane, and transplant rice on more than 690 mu, and accumulate and transport more than ten million jin of fertilizer, soldiers of a unit also helped the people build 27 houses, construct a transportation road, and dig more than 600 meters of canals, receiving warm praise from the people.

While extracting large amounts of manpower and material resources to support people's communes of all ethnic groups in summer production, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Xinjiang have also sent people to help people's communes develop sideline production. Border guards stationed on the Pamir Plateau are helping Tajik, Kirgiz, and other ethnic minority herdsmen living on the snowy mountains with their production. The soldiers also diligently cultivated more than 100 mu of grassland in their spare time, preparing to give the harvested pasture to the herdsmen when blizzards arrive and pasture is scarce in the winter.

Xinhua News Agency, June 6th – While helping people's communes in various regions with their summer harvest and planting, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have dispatched many ships and troops to protect fishing and shipping, prevent floods and provide disaster relief, and capture harmful animals, protecting the lives and property of the people.

A naval艇队 [艇队, Tingdui - flotilla of ships] on the Fujian front actively protects fishermen going out to sea to fish. Not long ago, five fishermen, including Zhang Yumu, went out to sea in a small boat and were suddenly hit by a force seven gale. The boat was overturned by the wind and waves, and the fishermen who fell into the water clung tightly to the small boat, drifting in the wind and waves. At this critical moment, the PLA艇队 immediately braved the raging winds and waves and rushed to the scene of the accident at the fastest speed, rescuing the fishermen in distress. On one occasion, a force nine typhoon suddenly struck the northeast Fujian sea area, and the ropes of the kelp rafts of the Sansha People's Commune were broken by the wind and waves, and more than 1,500 mu of kelp floated out to sea with the waves. Upon hearing the news, the PLA sailors immediately weighed anchor and set sail, searching for the kelp rafts in the raging waves. After a thrilling battle for an afternoon and a night, all the kelp was rescued. Afterwards, the members of the Sansha People's Commune gratefully beat gongs and drums and presented them with a silk banner, which read: "Braving the raging waves to bravely rescue kelp, showing heroism on the sea for the people."

In southern China, there has been a lot of rain recently, and some areas have experienced flash floods. Many troops have organized flood prevention teams to protect the safety of the people's lives and property. When a flood broke out in a certain place in Guangdong, a certain unit, which had organized a flood prevention team in advance, immediately set out and rescued more than 590 adults and children trapped by the flood, and rescued a large amount of grain and clothing. Fei Jingfang, a political instructor of a railway engineering unit, led his entire company to assist the members of the local people's commune in rescuing 100,000 bricks, more than 400 logs and bamboo poles from the turbulent river one night during a flash flood. In order to assist the local area in preventing floods and protecting seedlings, the "Tashan Hero Regiment" recently dispatched a large number of personnel to repair reservoirs for the people's communes. Under the command of the flood prevention headquarters, the Jiangxi Military Region troops dispatched many flood prevention shock brigades to the banks of the Gan River to repair dikes and protect the safety of the people's lives and property in the rain. In the rescue and disaster relief, many soldiers showed great communist spirit. Yu Jujian, a lieutenant engineer of a certain unit, sacrificed his life to save a child who had fallen into the water. Zheng Qiuhai, a sergeant squad leader, voluntarily postponed his wedding date in order to prevent floods and repair reservoirs.

In many areas where wild beasts are rampant, the People's Liberation Army has also specially dispatched troops to eliminate pests and eliminate wild beasts for the people. A unit stationed in Guangxi and the local militia jointly formed a "Wu Song Fights the Tiger Team", killing more than 100 wild boars and porcupines in a mountain range with a height of 2,000 meters within a week, turning this "pest-ridden village" in the mountain into a "pest-free village." In some places in Jiangxi, some chickens and ducks were taken away by jackals. After hearing the news, Miao Yongai, the company commander of a security company of a certain unit, immediately led several soldiers to find the wolf den and burned eight evil wolves to death.

    驻南方各地官兵展开护航护渔抢险救灾活动
    新华社6日讯　驻在西藏、云南、新疆等地区的人民解放军，在目前繁忙的夏季生产中，积极帮助当地各少数民族人民生产劳动。西藏拉萨地区的驻军，组织了大批的人力和物力，帮助藏胞夏耕夏种。“八一”农场的拖拉机和播种机，也奔驰在拉萨河谷的田野上，支援藏胞生产。进驻山南地区的平叛部队，利用一切空隙时间，帮助藏胞积肥、运肥、耕田和播种。某部官兵在部队首长率领下，组织了一支一百六十多人的劳动队伍，为泽当地区藏胞运肥三万多斤，并派出战马帮助耕种。广大藏胞欣悦地说：“解放军给我们播下了幸福的种子，扎下了吉祥的根！”
    驻在云南蒙自地区的部队，最近组织了一支一百多人的“支援群众插秧突击队”，由部队首长率领，支援兄弟民族人民插秧。他们从早到晚每天劳动十小时以上，连续苦战七天，共运肥三百多万斤，栽秧、铲田埂、薅包谷一百多亩。驻思茅地区的某部官兵出工六千五百多个劳动日，帮助佧佤族、拉祜族人民夏收夏种，并且大力支援修建勐帮水库的工程。某部官兵除了帮助兄弟民族人民砍山地、挖田、开荒、割油菜、种包谷、栽甘蔗和插秧六百九十多亩，积肥、运肥一千多万斤以外，还帮助人民修盖了二十七栋房屋，筑起一条运输公路，开挖了六百多公尺的水渠。受到人民的热烈赞扬。
    驻新疆的人民解放军部队，在抽出大批人力、物力支援各族人民公社进行夏季生产的同时，还派人帮助人民公社开展副业生产。驻守在帕米尔高原上的边防战士们，帮助居住在雪山上的塔吉克、柯尔克孜等族牧民进行生产。战士们还利用空隙时间，辛勤地培植了一百多亩草场，准备到冬天暴风雪降临、牧草缺乏的时候，好把收获的牧草送给牧民。
    新华社6日讯　人民解放军广大官兵，在帮助各地人民公社夏收夏种的同时，派出许多舰艇和部队护渔护航、防汛抢险、捕捉害兽，保卫人民的生命和财产。
    福建前线海军某艇队，积极保护渔民下海捕鱼。不久前，张玉木等五个渔民驾小船出海捕鱼，突然遇到七级大风，船被风浪打翻，落水的渔民紧紧抓住小船在风浪中飘流。在这危急时刻，解放军的艇队立刻冒着狂风巨浪，用最快的速度赶到出事地点，救出了遇险渔民。有一次，闽东北海面突然刮起九级台风，三沙人民公社系海带群的绳索被风浪打断了，一千五百多亩海带随浪向大海飘去。解放军的水兵们闻讯后，立即起锚出港，在滚滚的巨浪中，寻找海带群。经过一个下午和一个晚上的惊险搏斗，海带全部被抢救回来。事后，三沙人民公社的社员万分感激地敲锣打鼓送给他们一面锦旗，写着：“冒狂浪英勇救海带，为人民海上逞英豪”。
    在祖国南方，最近雨水较多，有些地区山洪暴发。许多部队组织了防汛队伍，保护人民生命财产的安全。驻广东的某部，在某地洪水暴发时，事先组织好的防汛队伍，立即出发，把被洪水围困的大人、小孩五百九十多名都抢救出来，并抢救出大批粮食和衣物。铁道兵某部指导员费静方，还在一次山洪暴发的深夜里，率领全连协助当地人民公社社员在湍急的大河里抢救出十万块砖，四百多根元木和竹竿。“塔山英雄团”为了协助地方防汛保苗，最近还派出大批人员为人民公社抢修水库。江西军区部队在防汛指挥部指挥下，许多防汛突击大队在赣江两岸，冒雨抢修堤坝，保卫人民生命财产的安全。在抢险救灾当中，许多战士表现出伟大的共产主义风格。某部工兵参谋余聚坚少尉为了抢救落水小孩，献出了自己的生命。中士班长郑秋海为了预防洪水，抢修水库，自动推迟回家结婚的日期。
    在许多有猛兽出没的地区，人民解放军还专门派出部队，为民除害，消灭猛兽。驻广西某部和当地民兵一起组成一个“武松打虎队”，在一座两千多公尺的丛山峻岭间，一周内打死野猪、豪猪等一百多只，把这座山里的“兽害村”变成“无害村”。江西某地有些鸡鸭被豺狼衔走，某部警卫连连长苗永爱闻讯后，立即带领几个战士找到狼洞，用火烧死八只恶狼。
