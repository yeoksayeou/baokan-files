Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 17th - According to TASS, the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" wrote today that the Western countries' attitude at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is like a game of hide-and-seek. They believe that their true intentions have not yet been exposed. But in reality, everyone can see who is truly putting forward constructive suggestions and striving for positive results with practical actions, and who is dragging out time and confusing the world public.

"Pravda" continued that at the Geneva Conference, the clumsy attempts of the Western countries were: to spread a thick smoke screen around the Geneva Conference, insisting that the Soviet Union was trying to impose its will on others, and that the Soviet Union wanted to "dictate." "Pravda" emphasized that if we talk about "dictating" and "ultimatums," then these methods, which are not applicable to international relations, are precisely what the Western representatives habitually used in Geneva. They demanded that the Soviet Union sign and recognize their "right of occupation" in West Berlin, while seeking all possible ways to extort and threaten. "Pravda" said that using this method to talk to the Soviet Union will never bring any benefits to the West.

"Pravda" pointed out that the Geneva Conference has not yet closed, but it can already be said with certainty that world public opinion will never sympathize with those who, for nearly a month and a half, have only tried to hinder the relaxation of international tension in Geneva. The newspaper concluded that the Foreign Ministers' Conference still has the potential to achieve positive results, which the people of all countries expect from the conference. To achieve this, one thing is needed: the Foreign Ministers of Western countries should calmly and without any illusions observe the international situation and recognize that the interests of all parties concerned should be taken into account when resolving outstanding issues.

    同苏联谈判休想敲诈和威胁
    苏联“真理报”谴责西方破坏日内瓦会议
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”今天写道，西方国家在日内瓦外长会议上的态度好像是捉迷藏一样。它们以为，它们的真正图谋还没有败露。但是实际上大家都看得出，是谁真正提出了建设性的建议、以实际行动争取积极的结果，是谁在拖延时间，迷惑世界公众。
    “真理报”接着说，在日内瓦会议上，西方国家的拙劣企图是：围绕日内瓦会议散布浓厚的烟幕，硬说苏联企图把自己的意志强加于人，苏联想“发号施令”。“真理报”强调指出，如果谈到什么“发号施令”和“最后通牒”，那末这些不适用于国际关系的手段正是西方国家代表在日内瓦所惯用的。他们要求苏联签字承认他们在西柏林的“占领权”，同时寻求一切可能进行敲诈和威胁的办法。“真理报”说，采用这种方法同苏联谈到任何时候也不会给西方带来好处。
    “真理报”指出，日内瓦会议还没有闭幕，但是已经可以肯定地说，世界公众决不会同情这样一些人，他们在将近一个半月的时间里，只是在日内瓦企图阻碍国际紧张局势的缓和。报纸最后写道，外长会议还有可能取得积极的成果，这是各国人民所期待于会议的。为此需要做到一点：西方国家的外长们冷静地、不抱任何幻想地观察一下国际局势并认识到，解决悬而未决的问题时应当考虑到各有关方面的利益。
