Snatching Grain from the Dragon's Mouth
By Our Reporter, Jiang Wenpin

Harvesting wheat in the rainy season means snatching grain from the dragon's mouth.

This is the slogan put forward by the members of the Dongjiao People's Commune in Licheng County, Shandong. Indeed, after putting in so much effort, people have finally achieved this bumper harvest year, how can they let the rain ruin the wheat!

Anyone who sees the golden wheat field of the Dongjiao People's Commune will be happy from the bottom of their hearts. A few days ago, organizations and troops helped the commune to rush harvest a batch of early-ripening wheat. On June 3rd, the sky was clear and the sun was shining. The members of the Second Team of the Daxinzhuang Production Brigade threshed a full field of wheat, harnessing five strong oxen to beat the grain.

Suddenly, dark clouds rose from the east, followed by lightning and thunder. The members knew something was wrong, and shouted, "Snatch grain from the 'dragon's mouth'!" The threshing ground was filled with activity, pitchforks, brooms, wooden shovels, and bamboo rakes flying through the air. Before long, large stacks of wheat, like fortresses, appeared all over the threshing ground.

In an instant, finger-thick raindrops lashed at people and wheat stacks. At this time, the members moved hundreds of pieces of straw mats and dozens of sorghum stalks from the field to surround and cover the wheat stacks. After the stacks were surrounded, people were still not at ease, and added two sorghum stalks to the side facing the rain. Only then did they retreat to the threshing ground. The wheat had not suffered any loss, and they all burst into joyful laughter.

The rain fell drippily like unbroken lotus roots for a day and two nights, and hadn't stopped by the morning of the third day. The members heard the emergency notice from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government on rushing to harvest wheat during the rainy season from the radio, and discussed various ways to rush the harvest. Seeing a glimmer of light in the dark sky, and the rain had just stopped, the members of the Second Team shouted, "Let's rush the wheat back from the field first!" Fifty or sixty people ran to the threshing ground, uncovered the piles of wheat, one circle of pitchforks picking out the straw in the piles, some winnowing, some sifting, some tossing, some sweeping. Two large chaff cutters were placed on the southeast side of the field, the wheat stacks were knocked down, and the wheat heads were chopped off with a "kachacha" sound. The bottom was padded high with wheat roots and seedlings, and the wheat ears were stacked on top… The tension of the people! It truly was the momentum of snatching grain from the dragon's mouth!

    龙口夺粮
    本报记者　姜文品
    麦收多雨，要从龙口里夺粮。
    这是山东历城县东郊公社的社员提出的口号。是呀，人们费了九牛二虎之力，好不容易争得这个丰收年，岂能让雨水把小麦毁掉！
    谁看到东郊人民公社那片黄澄澄的小麦就从心眼里高兴。头几天，机关部队帮助这个公社把早熟的麦子抢收了一批。6月3日这一天，晴空万里，烈日当空，大辛庄生产大队二队的社员们放了满满一场园麦子，套上五头壮牛打起场来。
    突然，东方起了乌云，闪光接着霹雷，社员们一看大事不好，喊了声“向‘龙口’里夺粮呀！”只见场上一片忙乱，杈把、扫帚、木掀、竹耙在空中飞舞。不多时，满场出现了像座座碉堡似的大个的麦垛。
    顷刻间，指头粗的雨点向人身、麦垛袭来。这时社员们又从场里搬出成百块草苫，几十个秫秸箔把麦垛围盖起来。麦垛围好了，人们还不放心，又从来雨的方向围上了两个秫秸箔。这时他们才退到场园，麦子没有受到一点损失，于是都咯咯地发出了欢乐的笑声。
    雨点像割不断的藕丝淋淋啦啦下了一天两夜，第三天上午还没停。社员们从广播中听到中央农业部发出在雨期抢收小麦的紧急通知，又讨论起各种抢收的办法。二队的社员一看乌天闪出一点亮光，雨刚好煞住，喊了声“先抢回场上的麦子再说”，五六十个人便跑到场园，揭开麦粒堆，一圈杈子挑出堆里的麦草，扬的扬，筛的筛，簸的簸，扫的扫，东南面的场边摆下两口大铡，搬倒麦垛，喀查查铡下麦头，底下用麦根麦秧垫得高高的，上面垛起麦穗……。人们那股紧张劲儿呀，可真是向龙口里抢粮的气势！
