    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Nobusuke Kishi group, in order to realize its conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," is stepping up its planning to overturn the fair verdict rendered by the Tokyo District Court in March of this year in the "Sunagawa Case."
    On June 2, under the direction of the Nobusuke Kishi government, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office filed an appeal regarding the "Sunagawa Case" directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing the intermediate appellate court. This makes it possible for the Supreme Court to render a verdict overturning the original ruling under pressure from the Nobusuke Kishi government. The National Federation of Organizations for the Defense of the Constitution decided on the afternoon of June 5 to launch a signature campaign across the country in support of the Tokyo District Court's ruling. In a statement issued on the 5th, this group also called on the Japanese people to monitor the Supreme Court's handling of the Tokyo District Court's judgment. Chairman Tetsu Katayama and others also went to the Supreme Court to demand a fair judgment in the "Sunagawa Case." The Japanese newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial on the 5th, severely condemning the conspiracy of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office and the Nobusuke Kishi government to overturn the Tokyo District Court's ruling. The editorial pointed out that the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office's unusually swift appeal to the Supreme Court regarding the "Sunagawa Case" clearly stems from the Nobusuke Kishi government's eagerness to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    岸内阁急于加强日美勾结
    阴谋推翻“砂川事件”判决
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：岸信介集团为了实现修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋，正加紧策划推翻今年3月东京地方裁判所对“砂川事件”的公正判决。
    6月2日，东京地方检察厅在岸信介政府指使下，就“砂川事件”判决越级向最高裁判所起诉。这样，最高裁判所就有可能在岸信介政府压力下，作出推翻原判的判决。日本拥护宪法国民联合会于6月5日下午决定在全国各地展开签名运动，支持东京地方裁判所的判决。这个团体并在5日发表的声明中，呼吁日本人民监视最高裁判所审判东京地方裁判所判决的行为。会长片山哲等人还到最高裁判所去要求公正地判决“砂川事件”。日本“赤旗报”于5日发表社论，严厉地谴责了东京地方检察厅和岸信介政府企图推翻东京地方裁判所判决的阴谋。社论指出，东京地方检察厅一反常例，那样快地向最高裁判所就“砂川事件”提出上诉，显然是因为岸信介政府急于修改日美“安全条约”。
