Prepare Well to Achieve Large-Scale High Yield

Su Guang, Deputy Director of Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration

Kailuan Coal Mine is one of the main bases for the production of coking coal in China. From January to April this year, in the socialist labor competition, the mine actually produced 5,016,399 tons of coal, an increase of 100,7,289 tons over the state plan, and 49.75% higher than the same period last year. At the same time, all economic indicators were fully completed according to plan. With the sharp increase in coal production, production preparation has been further strengthened, and the amount of coal obtained (i.e., the minable period) has reached more than five months, achieving the large-scale high-yield requirements of the Ministry of Coal Industry.

　　　　The Right Path

Kailuan Coal Mine is an old mine that has been mined for more than 70 years. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, and after a series of production reforms and technical transformations, especially the strengthening of production preparation work in recent years, the continuous improvement of management level and worker technical level has created conditions for large-scale high yield. Last year, Kailuan Coal Mine produced more than 12,690,000 tons of coal, an increase of 51.3% over 1957. According to the plan, there will be a greater leap forward this year than last year. However, the new mine cannot be put into production this year, and the roadways of the original old mines are becoming deeper and farther. How to complete the plan? One way is to rely on a large amount of input into the working face to increase production. This not only cannot keep up with production preparation, but also cannot meet the large amount of equipment and labor required; the other way is to tap the potential of existing mines, increase output per unit area, and achieve large-scale high yield. At the beginning, some comrades did not have a sufficient understanding of the benefits of the second method. After studying the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of the Ministry of Coal on carrying out the large-scale high-yield movement, and at the same time, we organized everyone to review the experience of the fourth quarter of 1958, everyone's understanding was unified, and the determination to take the road of large-scale high yield was strengthened.

Therefore, we launched a large-scale high-yield competition among the masses. In mobilizing the masses, in addition to carrying out special forums, in March this year, we also launched a large-scale airing of views, debates, and big-character posters centered on the comprehensive completion of the plan, posting 2 million big-character posters, focusing on exposing the key problems that hinder the overall leap forward in production. In the airing of views and debates, the masses offered suggestions and strategies. In less than ten days, 90% of the key production problems were solved, and the cooperation between various production departments was gradually coordinated. Therefore, in March and April, the average monthly output of all recovery working faces in the mine reached 14,412 tons, of which 67.55 working faces participating in the comparison according to the standards of the Ministry of Coal accounted for 86.47% of all working faces, and the average monthly output of each working face reached 15,514 tons, exceeding the competition standard of 15,000 tons. In the realization of large-scale high yield, a total of 85 working faces with a monthly output of more than 10,000 tons appeared in the entire mining area in March and April, accounting for 40.55% of the total number of working faces. Among them, there were 27 working faces with a monthly output of more than 20,000 tons, and the quality of coal was improved compared with the national plan. The realization of large-scale high yield guaranteed the over-fulfillment of the plan from January to April this year.

　　　　The Enlightenment of "Double Circulation"

Last summer, the 4991 heading face of Linxi Coal Mine, based on the suggestion of Soviet experts, created a record of double circulation per day with a combine harvester, and the output increased sharply by one time. At this time, some people regarded it as an accidental phenomenon, believing that it happened under specific conditions, and attempted to deny it. They only knew that coal production cannot work without cyclical operations, but they were afraid of too many cycles, disrupting normal operations, and only wanted to organize one cycle per day and night. However, party organizations at all levels seized the budding of this new thing of double circulation per day with a combine harvester, and immediately sent people to summarize it, held on-site meetings, and organized its promotion. Soon, many high-yield headings with multiple circulations appeared on various working faces. Especially the 6514 heading face of Linxi Mine, with the support of the mine leaders and the personal command of the district chief and branch secretary, clarified the division of labor in each link, closely cooperated, and continuously organized new balances. Therefore, on the basis of embarking on double circulation, it successively embarked on three cycles, four cycles, five cycles, and six cycles. By October 10 last year, it created the highest national record of eight cycles per day, refreshing the advanced indicators in the history of combine harvester coal mining. This coal mining team has been maintaining double circulation and more cycles per day since May 18 last year. This fact powerfully demonstrates the possibility of persistently organizing multiple cycles.

With the enlightenment of double circulation and the experience of multiple cycles, all our mine workers have more firmly established the idea of large-scale high yield.

　　　　A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats

When the progress of the recovery working face is accelerated and large-scale high yield appears, the minable period of the recovery heading face is rapidly shortened, and the connection between mining and tunneling is required to be advanced. Therefore, accelerating the tunneling progress is an important condition to ensure the persistence and consolidation of production.

Coal mining and tunneling have always been two parallel operation fronts in coal mines. If we only focus on accelerating the progress of coal mining without accelerating the tunneling speed or lengthening the front line and dispersing tunneling, it will inevitably cause the disconnection between production and production preparation work, making production passive. Therefore, we have always implemented the principle of grasping production with one hand, grasping preparation with the other, grasping high yield with one hand, and grasping high speed with the other, and never weaken the strength of production preparation work and relax leadership under any circumstances, and always meet the needs of production preparation work first in all aspects, and always maintain a certain mining and tunneling ratio. From the management office to the party, government, and labor union organizations of each mine, there is a set of cadres, technicians, and workers who lead the development and tunneling work, just like the coal mining work. Especially when increasing new workers, the entire mine appropriately met the needs of production preparation, vigorously trained and organized new tunneling teams. Over the years, we have always adhered to various effective management systems, such as holding regular joint meetings of mining, tunneling, geology, transportation, and ventilation units to comprehensively arrange tunneling and development. In order to maintain the materials necessary for tunneling, we also often hold meetings to arrange and strive to maintain balance. In the daily organization of production activities, while vigorously promoting mechanization in recovery, tunneling promotes small-scale mechanization; while vigorously promoting hydraulic mining in recovery, tunneling also simultaneously promotes hydraulic tunneling and water transportation; while vigorously promoting rapid coal mining in recovery, tunneling also promotes various advanced experiences and carries out rapid tunneling. Therefore, many rapid tunneling teams have emerged on various working faces. For example, Wang Chunzhen's rock drilling team in Linxi Mine completed the large-section one-time roadway construction of the 7002 tramway in January, with a monthly progress of 225.35 meters in hard rock of level 10 to 12. The Wang Chaoxu tunneling team in Tangjiazhuang completed 142% of the first quarter's plan, with a monthly progress of 1,486.95 meters in March.

This year, in order to meet the needs of large-scale high yield, we have effectively taken measures to shorten the front line, concentrate tunneling, accelerate progress, and timely ensure the connection between mining, tunneling, and development. Especially in the current situation of insufficient manpower and materials and the urgent need to strengthen production preparation, it has great practical significance.

　　　　Eight Major Advantages

The large-scale high-yield red flag competition movement is the best way for coal mine workers to implement the Party's general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and to realize increased production and thrift. Through this period of practice, we have realized that large-scale high yield has eight major advantages.

First, it has changed the past situation of high yield in individual working faces, and the failure to improve the output of all working faces and the production level of the entire mine. Last year, there were only about ten working faces with a monthly output of more than 10,000 tons in the entire mine. In March and April this year, 54.5% of the coal mining working faces reached the level of more than 10,000 tons.

Second, it fully utilizes the potential of existing equipment. This year, coal production has greatly increased without adding new large-scale equipment, and without increasing coal cars and electric locomotives. The average daily output in March and April increased by 6,227 tons compared with last year, which is equivalent to saving the equipment of thirteen working faces. If calculated according to the actual output in April, it is equivalent to saving the equipment of twenty-three working faces.

Third, it has improved working hours utilization and fully utilized human potential. Six working faces have implemented three-shift operations and four-shift cross-operations, with a daily output increase of more than 3,000 tons compared with the original, which is equivalent to the production capacity of a mine with an annual output of one million tons.

Fourth, the large-scale high-yield movement centered on increasing the output per unit working face has driven the improvement of various production links, prompting continuous improvement in production management and technical management, and achieving comprehensive improvement.

Fifth, it has comprehensively promoted 36 advanced experiences, and more than half of the new workers underground have mastered more than two operating techniques.

Sixth, it has promoted the improvement of leadership style. In the large-scale high-yield movement, leaders at all levels have gone deep into the front lines, participated in labor, and specifically helped solve many practical problems.

Seventh, the workers' political consciousness has been further improved, and the communist spirit of cooperation has been further developed. The "five satisfactions" movement carried out by the tunneling workers in Zhaogezhuang concretely demonstrated the communist cooperation style of strengthening unity and mutual support between tunneling and coal mining, transportation, and other departments.

Eighth, the economic effect is good, reflecting the comprehensiveness of completing various indicators. It has achieved high output, high efficiency, good quality, good safety, and low cost.

    做好准备实现大面积丰产
    开滦煤矿总管理处副主任　苏光
    开滦煤矿是我国生产焦煤的主要基地之一。今年1至4月份在社会主义劳动竞赛中，全矿实际产煤五百零一万六千三百九十九吨，比国家计划增产十万零七千二百八十九吨，比去年同期提高49.75％。同时，各项经济指标也都全面完成了计划。在煤炭产量猛增的情况下，生产准备工作有了进一步的加强，获得煤量（即可采期）达到五个多月。实现了煤炭工业部大面积高额丰产的要求。
            路走对了
    开滦煤矿是一个开采了七十多年的老矿，解放以来，在党的领导下，经过一系列的生产改革和技术改造，特别是几年来生产准备工作的加强，管理水平和工人技术水平的不断提高，给大面积丰产创造了条件。去年，开滦煤矿产煤一千二百六十九万多吨，比1957年增产51.3％；按照计划，今年比去年将有更大的跃进。但是，今年新建井不能投入生产，原有老矿井采区巷道越来越深远。怎样完成计划，一种办法是依靠大量投入工作面来增加产量，这不仅生产准备赶不上，并且需要增添的大量器材设备和劳动力也无法满足；另一种办法是，挖掘现有矿井的潜力，提高单位面积产量，实现大面积丰产。开始，有些同志对第二种办法的好处认识不足，经过学习党的八届六中全会的决议和煤炭部关于开展大面积丰产运动的指示，同时，我们又组织大家重温了1958年四季度的经验，大家的认识统一了，走大面积丰产之路的决心坚定了。
    于是，我们发动群众开展了大面积高额丰产竞赛。在发动群众中，除了开展专题鸣放之外，在今年3月，还围绕全面完成计划为中心，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，贴出了二百万张大字报，集中揭发了障碍生产全面跃进的关键问题。在鸣放辩论中，群众献计献策，不到十天，90％的生产关键问题都解决了，各个生产部门的配合逐步协调。因此，3、4月份全矿全部回采工作面平均月产量达到一万四千四百一十二吨，其中按煤炭部标准参加评比的六十七点五五个工作面占全部工作面的86.47％，每个工作面平均月产量达到一万五千五百一十四吨，超过了一万五千吨的竞赛标准。在实现大面积丰产中，全矿区3、4月份共出现了八十五个月产万吨以上的工作面，占工作面总数的40.55％。其中有月产二万吨以上的工作面二十七个，而且煤炭质量都比国家计划有所提高。大面积丰产的实现，保证了今年1至4月份计划的超额完成。
          “双循环”的启示
    去年夏季，林西煤矿4991掌子根据苏联专家的建议，创造了康拜因日进双循环的纪录，产量猛增一倍。这时，有些人把它看作是偶然现象，认为这是在一个特定条件下发生的，企图加以否定。他们只知道煤炭生产不走循环作业不行，可是又害怕循环走多了，打乱正常作业，只想组织一昼夜走一个循环。但是，各级党组织却抓住了康拜因日进双循环这一新事物的萌芽，马上派人总结，召开现场会议，组织推广。不久，就在各种工作面上出现了不少多循环的高产掌子。尤其是林西矿6514掌子在矿领导的支持及区长、支部书记的亲自指挥下，各个环节明确分工，紧密配合，不断组织新的平衡，因而在走上双循环的基础上，又连续走上了三循环、四循环、五循环、六循环。到去年10月10日创造了日进八循环的全国最高纪录，刷新了康拜因采煤有史以来的先进指标。这一采煤队自去年5月18日开始到现在，一直保持着日进双循环和更多的循环，这个事实，有力地说明了持久地组织多循环的可能性。
    有了双循环的启示和多循环的经验，我们全矿职工更加牢固地树立了大面积丰产的思想。
            水涨船高
    当回采工作面进度加快，出现大面积丰产以后，回采掌子的可采期迅速缩短，采掘衔接要求提前，因此加快掘进进度，是保证生产持久和巩固的重要条件。
    采煤和掘进从来就是煤矿的二道平行作业战线，如果只顾加快采煤进度，不加快掘进速度或者拉长战线，分散掘进，必然会造成生产和生产准备工作脱节、使生产被动的局面。因此，我们自始至终贯彻了一手抓生产，一手抓准备，一手抓高产，一手抓高速，在任何情况下都不削弱生产准备工作力量和放松领导，在各方面先满足生产准备工作的需要，经常保持一定的采掘比例。从管理处到各矿的党、政、工各级组织都和采煤工作一样，有一套领导开拓掘进工作的干部、技术人员和工人。特别是在增加新工人时，全矿都适当满足了生产准备的需要，大力培训和组织新掘进队。几年以来，我们始终坚持了各种行之有效的管理制度，如定期召开采、掘、地质、运输、通风等单位的联席会，全面安排掘进、开拓。为了保持掘进所必需的物资，也经常开会排队，力求保持平衡。日常组织生产活动中，在回采大搞机械化的同时，掘进就推广小型机械化；回采大搞水力化，掘进也同时搞水掘水运；在回采大搞快速采煤时，掘进也推广了各种先进经验，开展快速掘进。因而，在各类工作面上涌现出不少快速掘进队。如林西矿王春珍凿岩队1月份在7002电车道大断面一次成巷，十至十二级硬岩月进二百二十五点三五公尺。唐家庄王朝旭掘进队完成第一季度计划的142％，3月份月进一千四百八十六点九五公尺。
    今年，我们为了适应大面积丰产的需要，有力地采取了缩短战线，集中掘进的办法，加快进度，及时保证了采、掘、开衔接，特别是在当前人力、器材不足，生产准备急需加强的情况下，更有重大的现实意义。
              八大优点
    大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动，是煤矿职工贯彻党的多快好省建设社会主义总路线和实现增产节约的最好途径。通过这一时期的实践，我们体会到大面积丰产有八大优点。
    第一，改变了过去的个别工作面高产、全部工作面产量和整个矿井生产水平提不高的局面。去年全矿月产万吨以上的工作面只有十个左右，今年3、4月份就有54.5％的采煤工作面达到了万吨以上的水平。
    第二，充分地发挥现有设备的潜力。今年煤产量大大提高，没有增加新的大型设备，没有增加煤车、电机车。3、4月份平均日产量比去年提高六千二百二十七吨，相当于节省了十三个工作面的设备。如果按4月份的实际产量计算，则相当于节省了二十三个工作面的设备。
    第三，提高了工时利用，充分发挥了人的潜力。有六个工作面推行了三班作业和四班交叉作业，日产量比原来提高三千多吨，相当于一个年产一百万吨矿井的生产能力。
    第四，以提高单位工作面为中心的大面积丰产运动，带动了各个生产环节的改进，促使生产管理和技术管理不断改进，达到全面提高。
    第五，全面推广了三十六项先进经验，井下有一半以上的新工人掌握了两种以上的操作技术。
    第六，促进了领导作风的改进。在大面积丰产运动中，各级领导都深入现场，参加劳动，具体帮助解决了很多实际问题。
    第七，工人政治觉悟进一步提高，共产主义协作精神进一步发扬。赵各庄掘进工人开展的“五满意”运动，具体地表现了掘进与采煤、运输等部门之间加强团结，互相支援的共产主义协作风格。
    第八，经济效果好，体现了完成各种指标的全面性。做到产量高、效率高，质量好、安全好，成本低。
