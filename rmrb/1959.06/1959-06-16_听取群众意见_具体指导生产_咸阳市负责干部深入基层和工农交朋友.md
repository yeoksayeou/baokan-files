    Listening to the Opinions of the Masses and Providing Specific Guidance to Production
    Xianyang City's Responsible Cadres Go Deep into the Grassroots and Make Friends with Workers and Peasants

    (Our reporter Yi Xiao reports) In order to change the style of leadership, strengthen leadership, and do a better job, the responsible cadres of Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, have established fixed contact points at the grassroots level, which has become a system.

    The Secretary of the Xianyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, members of the Standing Committee, and the Mayor and Deputy Mayors have all made a number of friends in their respective base points in factories or agricultural production teams by working as commune members or workers. These friends include grassroots cadres, ordinary people, the elderly, young people, activists, and even "oppositionists." The practice of leading cadres establishing base points for contacting the masses at the grassroots level was decided at the Xianyang Municipal Party Congress in February this year, and has been implemented for several months now.

    With these base points for contacting the masses, leaders can promptly gain an in-depth understanding of the problems in grassroots production and provide more specific leadership. Since the two Municipal Party Secretaries, one member of the committee, one member of the Standing Committee, and one Deputy Mayor responsible for industry established base points in factories, the Municipal Party Committee's leadership over industry has progressed from generally making demands to making demands based on the different situations of various factories. After Municipal Party Secretary He Zhiqing participated in production at the Local State-Owned Machinery Factory No. 2, he found that this factory, which was newly built during the Great Leap Forward last year, had not established rules and regulations, labor discipline was lax, and production order was chaotic, and the vast majority of workers in the factory were very dissatisfied with this situation. He further learned that other local factories newly built last year also had similar situations. Therefore, he suggested that the Municipal Party Committee first launch a mass airing of views and great debates in these factories in the form of a small-scale rectification campaign to formulate systems, rectify discipline, establish a normal production order, and then launch a technical innovation movement. After doing this, the situation of these factories, which had failed to complete their plans month after month, was quickly changed. The Machine Shop of Machinery Factory No. 1 only rectified the production order and eliminated waste of working hours, which increased production efficiency by one time.

    In the past, responsible cadres went to factories and the countryside only for a superficial look and it was difficult to make friends among the masses. Since they had "base areas" and often lived and worked with the masses, they made many friends. Workers and commune members often came to their familiar secretaries to report on the situation, talk about their thoughts, and make requests, so that the Municipal Party Committee maintained regular contact with the masses. At the end of February and the beginning of March this year, the Municipal Party Committee decided to universally apply topdressing fertilizer to wheat fields, but there was not enough fertilizer. Municipal Party Secretary Xu Tingfang returned to his work base point, Beishangzhao Village, and consulted with his group of friends, who found dozens of sources of fertilizer and solved the problem of insufficient fertilizer.

    Some responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee not only made friends with some activists, but also made friends with some who often held dissenting opinions. When Municipal Party Secretary Su Yaoxian participated in labor evaluation in Wuche Village, most people believed that the cadres had done a lot for everyone and should be rated higher. However, an old man objected, saying, "What first class, second class, isn't it just a mixed evaluation!" Others said that this old man just liked to say strange things and should be ignored. Su Yaoxian was familiar with him usually, so he asked him to talk about it. The old man frankly expressed his opinion on the cadres' poor labor. Su Yaoxian further learned that there were more people with this opinion than just this old man. For this reason, the Municipal Party Committee held a meeting in Jiacun to study the work methods of cadres. After all the cadres of the communes arrived, they first worked with the commune members of Jiacun for a morning, and in the afternoon they held a meeting in the fields to study the labor problems of cadres, and decided not to be divorced from production. After the meeting, they helped the commune members deliver manure. The commune members of Jiacun posted many big-character posters to praise the cadres who attended the meeting.

    The practice of the Municipal Party Committee leaders going deep into the grassroots to establish base points and make friends has greatly affected the leadership style of cadres throughout the city, especially middle-level responsible cadres. Now the ministers and bureau chiefs of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, factory directors, and commune directors have generally gone down to establish base points and participate in production.

### 听取群众意见　具体指导生产  咸阳市负责干部深入基层和工农交朋友

    听取群众意见　具体指导生产
    咸阳市负责干部深入基层和工农交朋友
    本报讯　记者伊晓报道：为了改变领导作风，加强领导，更好地做好工作，陕西咸阳市负责干部建立固定的联系基点，已成为一种制度。
    中共咸阳市委书记、常委和正副市长，在自己联系的工厂或农业生产队的基点里，通过当社员、当工人的办法，都结交了若干朋友，其中有基层干部、一般群众、老人、青年、积极分子，也有“反对派”。领导干部在基层建立联系群众的基点的作法，是今年2月间咸阳市党代表会议决定的，到现在已经执行几个月了。
    有了这样联系群众的基点，领导就能够及时深入了解基层生产中的问题，更具体地进行领导。自从负责工业的两个市委书记、一个委员、一个常委、一个副市长在工厂建立基点以后，市委对工业的领导已经由过去一般地提出要求，进而根据各类厂不同情况分别提出要求。市委书记贺志清到地方国营机械二厂参加生产后，发现这个在去年大跃进中新建的工厂，并未建立规章制度，劳动纪律松弛，生产秩序混乱，厂内绝大部分工人对这种情况很不满意。他更进一步了解到其他去年新建的地方工厂，也都存在着类似情况。于是他建议市委在这类工厂中先发动工人大鸣大放大辩论，以小整风的方式来制订制度，整顿纪律，建立起正常的生产秩序，再开展技术革新运动。这样作以后，迅速改变了这些厂月月完不成计划的情况。机械一厂的机工车间只是整顿了生产秩序，消灭了工时浪费，就使生产效率提高了一倍。
    以前负责干部下厂下乡，只是走马观花，很难在群众中交下朋友，自从有了“根据地”，经常和群众在一起生活和劳动，也就交下了不少朋友，常有些工人、社员来找他们熟悉的书记反映情况、谈谈思想，提出要求，这样市委和群众保持了经常的联系。今年2月底3月初，市委决定向麦田普遍施一次浮肥，但肥料不足，市委许廷方书记回到自己的工作基点北上照村，把自己那伙朋友请来一商量，就找到了几十种肥源，把肥料不足的问题解决了。
    市委一些负责同志不仅交了一些积极分子的朋友，而且也交了一些经常爱持反对意见的朋友。市委书记苏耀先在五车村参加劳动评级时，一般人都认为干部为大家办了好多事情，应该把级别评高点。可是有一位老汉就反对，他说“什么一级、二级，还不是混评哩！”别人都说这位老汉就爱说怪话，不要管他。苏耀先平时和他熟悉，就请他扯扯。这位老汉直率谈出了对干部劳动不好有意见。苏耀先深入一了解，有这种意见的人不只是这个老汉。市委为此在贾村召开了一个研究干部工作方法的会议，各公社干部到齐后，先和贾村的社员劳动了一上午，下午就在地头上开会，研究干部劳动问题，并决定不脱离生产。会完了又帮助社员送粪。贾村的社员对开会的干部贴了许多大字报大加赞扬。
    市委领导人深入基层建立基点交朋友的作法，对改变全市干部特别是中层负责干部的领导作风起了很大作用。现在市委、市人民委员会的部长、局长，工厂厂长，公社的社长、主任，都已经普遍下去建立基点参加生产。
