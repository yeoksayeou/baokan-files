North Vietnamese People Strongly Protest the Atrocities of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem Clique

(Our Dispatch) For several months, the movement protesting the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's violation of the Geneva Accords and the frantic slaughter of the South Vietnamese people has spread rapidly like a prairie fire throughout North Vietnam.

According to incomplete statistics, in the past two months alone, more than 600,000 people have participated in more than 100 rallies to protest the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's escalating crimes against the South Vietnamese people. Since the beginning of the struggle against the U.S.-directed Ngo Dinh Diem clique's creation of the Phu Loi massacre at the beginning of this year, more than 2 million people in North Vietnam have participated in more than 15,000 demonstrations and rallies organized in urban and rural areas, and more than 4 million people have signed protests against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's heinous crimes in the Phu Loi concentration camp. In a short period of time, appeals written by the masses of people in various places have flown like snowflakes to the International Commission in Vietnam, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, and the "Committee for the Struggle Against the Phu Loi Massacre." People resolutely demanded that the International Commission take active measures to stop the atrocities of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities and force them to abolish the 1959 Decree No. 10, which aimed at establishing "special military tribunals" to suppress the South Vietnamese people. During this period, people from all over North Vietnam also sent more than 800 delegations to directly meet with the International Commission in Vietnam, demanding that the International Commission immediately investigate the Phu Loi massacre.

Due to the deep-seated hatred for the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique and the deep sympathy for the persecuted South Vietnamese compatriots, countless inspiring deeds have emerged among the people of North Vietnam. At protest rallies, people wrote resolutions in their own blood; a small child of eight years old in a certain place trekked to Hanoi to personally submit his written appeal to the International Commission in Vietnam; even some blind old people asked their children and grandchildren to lead them to participate in demonstrations.

At the same time, the slogans "Turn hatred into strength" and "Turn hatred into practical action" resounded throughout North Vietnam. "Phu Loi Work Hours," "Phu Loi Sundays," "Wash Away Phu Loi Hatred Day," "Wash Away Phu Loi Hatred Week," "Phu Loi Massacre Revenge Month," and "Phu Loi Campaign," organized to protest U.S.-Ngo atrocities and support the struggle of the South Vietnamese people, have emerged in the vast cities, villages, factories, construction sites, schools, and offices of North Vietnam. In these activities, people worked with selfless spirit in production and construction.

Currently, the movement of the North Vietnamese people protesting against the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem clique's murder of the South Vietnamese people is still developing vigorously.

    越北人民强烈抗议美吴集团暴行
    本报讯　几个月来，抗议美国—吴庭艳集团违反日内瓦协议、疯狂屠杀南越人民的运动，犹如燎原的熊熊烈火，迅速地燃遍了整个越南北方。
    据不完全统计，仅在最近两个多月，就有六十多万人参加了一百多次集会，抗议美吴集团变本加厉杀害南越人民的罪行。而从今年年初抗议美国指使吴庭艳集团制造富利惨案的斗争开展以来，整个越南北方已经有二百多万人参加了在各地城乡组织的一万五千多次示威游行和集会，有四百多万人签名抗议美吴集团在富利集中营犯下的滔天罪行。在短短的时间中，各地人民群众写的呼吁书像雪片一般纷纷飞到越南国际委员会、越南祖国战线中央委员会和“富利惨案斗争委员会”。人们坚决要求国际委员会采取积极措施来制止吴庭艳当局的暴行，并迫使他们废除旨在建立镇压南越人民的“特别军事法庭”的1959年第十号法令。在这期间，越南北方各地人民还派出了八百多个代表团，直接会见越南国际委员会，要求国际委员会立即对富利惨案进行调查。
  由于对美吴集团的刻骨仇恨和对惨遭迫害的南越同胞的深切同情，在越南北方人民群众中出现了无数激动人心的事迹。在抗议集会上，人们用自己的鲜血写成了决议书；某地一个八岁的小孩跋涉到河内，亲自把自己写的呼吁书送交越南国际委员会；甚至一些双目失明的老人也要自己的儿孙带领去参加示威游行。
    与这同时，“把仇恨化为力量”、“把仇恨变为实际行动”的口号响遍全北越。为抗议美吴暴行和支援南越人民斗争而组织的“富利工作时”、“富利星期日”、“洗雪富利仇恨日”、“洗雪富利仇恨周”、“为富利惨案复仇月”和“富利战役”等等，纷纷在越南北方广大城市、乡村、工厂、工地、学校和机关出现，在这些活动中，人们以忘我的精神进行生产和建设工作。
    目前，越南北方人民抗议美国和吴庭艳集团杀害南越人民的运动仍在风起云涌地发展中。
