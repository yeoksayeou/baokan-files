Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, June 12th: Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Secretary-General Pote Sarasin openly declared on June 9th, in response to questions from the press regarding the Laotian situation, that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization could not "sit idly by" as the situation in Laos developed. He also expressed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's "boundless concern" for the "security" of Laos.

Sarasin said that if the Kingdom of Laos suffered so-called "armed aggression" by the communists, it would have the right to request "assistance" from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization would be willing to consider accepting the request of the Kingdom of Laos.

As previously reported, on May 21st, the Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Khamphan Panya, blatantly stated to reporters in Saigon that the government of the Kingdom of Laos would seek "help" from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the event of what he called "foreign aggression." These words of Sarasin and Panya clearly expose the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's conspiracy to find excuses to further intervene militarily in the Laotian situation.

In response to a question about whether Laos would be accepted into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Sarasin said, "If the government of any country believes that the policies of this organization are consistent with its own policies, it can request to join the organization."

    东南亚集团秘书长沙拉信扬言
    要武装干涉老挝局势
    新华社12日讯　曼谷消息：东南亚条约组织秘书长乃朴·沙拉信9日答复报界提出的有关老挝局势的问题时公然宣称，东南亚条约组织将不能“坐视”老挝局势的发展。他还表示了东南亚条约组织对老挝的“安全”的“无限关心”。
    沙拉信说，如果老挝王国遭受所谓共产党的“武装侵略”，它有权向东南亚条约组织要求“援助”，而东南亚条约组织将愿意考虑接受老挝王国政府的要求。
    前已报道，老挝王国外交大臣坎番·班雅5月21日在西贡对记者发表谈话时曾经露骨地说，老挝王国政府在发生他所谓的“外国侵略”时，将寻求东南亚条约组织的“帮助”，沙拉信和班雅的这些话，清楚地暴露了东南亚条约组织企图寻找借口来进一步武装干涉老挝局势的阴谋。
    沙拉信在答复关于是否接受老挝加入东南亚条约组织的问题时说，“如果任何国家的政府认为这个机构的政策同它的政策一致时，它是可以要求加入这个组织的。”
