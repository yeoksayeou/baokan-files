“Small Farms” – Mass Experimental Fields
    Wu Zanting, Li Yuxiu

    In agricultural activities, it is necessary to grasp both the general laws of increased agricultural production and the specific laws of increased production for various crops in the local area and at the current time. In various regions, under various different conditions, and among various crops, how can we properly implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture? How can we seek various specific laws under the guidance of the general laws of increased agricultural production? One of the important methods to solve this problem is to "do everything through experimentation."

    The "small farm" run by the Xiaji Luo Management District of the Xiong Huo Commune is a form of experimentation. Following the principle of "small-plot experiments, large-field promotion," they started with autumn planting last year and conducted experiments on close planting, varieties, fertilization, planting methods, and watering in four mu of wheat fields on the "small farm." As a result, they not only selected some excellent varieties suitable for local growth, but also initially explored some specific experiences in implementing the Eight-Character Charter for agriculture locally, and promptly used them to guide large-field production. This year, when watering wheat for green-up, some people advocated early watering, while others advocated late watering. Who was right and who was wrong? Let the "small farm" use practice to draw a conclusion! On March 21st, two mu of wheat on the "small farm" were watered for green-up first. After three days, the wheat showed a runaway growth phenomenon, and after six or seven days, it lodged. They analyzed the reasons and postponed the watering time for large-area wheat by twenty days.

    The "small farm" combines old experiences with new technologies, taking the essence and discarding the dross. On the "small farm," various different opinions from cadres and the masses on the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture are used for comparative experiments. The "small farm" also adopted scientific management methods, constantly observing and recording the growth changes of crops, continuously analyzing and studying the laws of crop growth and management, and establishing a crop archive system. The result of doing so is to improve the scientific and technical level of cadres and the masses relatively quickly.

    The "small farm" in Xiaji Luo clearly stipulates that the purpose of the experiment is to obtain good experiences for promotion, and to experiment and promote simultaneously. Small-plot experiments, large-field promotion, small cost, big benefit, the masses are satisfied. This kind of experimental field is a mass experimental field, a truly experimental field that meets the purpose of the experiment.

    “小农场”——群众性的试验田
    武赞庭  李玉秀
    在农事活动中，既要掌握农业增产的一般规律，也要掌握当地、当时各种作物增产的特殊规律。在各个地区，在各种不同的条件下，在各项作物中，怎样恰到好处地执行“八字宪法”呢？怎样在农业增产的一般规律的指导下寻求各种特殊规律呢？解决这个问题的重要方法之一，就是“一切通过试验”。
    雄火公社下纪落管理区办的“小农场”，是一种试验的形式。他们按照“小田试验，大田推广”的方针，从去年秋播开始，在“小农场”里用四亩麦田进行了密植、品种、施肥、种植、浇水等试验。结果不仅选出一些适宜当地生长的优良品种，而且初步摸索到了一些当地执行农业八字宪法的具体经验，及时用来指导大田生产。今年在浇小麦返青水的时候，有些人主张早浇水；另一部分人主张迟浇水。究竟谁是谁非？让“小农场”用实践来作结论吧！3月21日“小农场”的二亩小麦先浇了返青水。过了三天小麦便出现了狂长现象，过了六七天便倒伏了。他们分析了原因，就把大面积小麦的浇水时间推迟了二十天。
    “小农场”把老经验同新技术结合起来，做到了取其精华，去其糟粕。在“小农场”里，把干部和群众中对执行农业“八字宪法”的各种不同的意见，都拿来进行对比试验。“小农场”还采取了科学的管理方法，经常观察记录作物生长变化情况，不断地分析研究作物生长和管理的规律，并且建立了作物档案制度。这样做的结果，就比较快地提高了干部和群众的科学技术水平。
    下纪落的“小农场”，明确规定试验的目的就在于取得好的经验来推广，而且边试验，边推广。小田试验，大田推广，成本小，得益大，群众满意。这种试验田是群众性的试验田，是真正合乎试验的目的的试验田。
