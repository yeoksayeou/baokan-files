The most important issue in painting landscapes is the "artistic conception," which is the soul of landscape painting.

What is artistic conception? I believe that artistic conception is the combination of scenery and emotion; writing about scenery is writing about emotion. Landscape painting is not an explanation or diagram of geography or the natural environment. Needless to say, it certainly requires accuracy in natural geography, but more importantly, it expresses people's thoughts and feelings towards nature. One's feelings arise from seeing the scenery, and the scenery and emotion must be combined. If one one-sidedly pursues the natural scientific aspect, painting flowers or birds will become dead specimens, and painting scenery will lack interest and artistic meaning. If one is not moved oneself, one certainly cannot move others.

In our ancient poems, there is often a very good artistic conception. Although not a single sentence is written about "people," the thoughts and feelings of people are fully expressed through writing about scenery. For example, Li Taibai's lines "Farewell to Meng Haoran at Yellow Crane Tower heading for Guangling":

　　My old friend bids farewell to the Yellow Crane Tower in the west,
　　Amidst the misty blossoms of March, heading down to Yangzhou.
　　A solitary sail, its distant silhouette disappearing into the azure sky,
　　Leaving only the Yangtze River flowing towards the horizon.

This contains the melancholy of parting with a friend, making people think of the scene of reluctant farewell: the sail has already gone far and disappeared, and the person seeing off still gazes at the river, as if their heart has gone with the sail and the flowing water... Emotion is implied in the scenery. These four lines do not write about the author's emotions at all, especially the last two lines, which completely describe the natural scenery; however, it is in these two lines that people deeply appreciate the poet's deep friendship.

Chairman Mao's poems have a very deep artistic conception, such as the three poems in the Sixteen-Character Verse Form. Each poem is about scenery, and each character is about mountains, but each poem and each character fully express people's thoughts and feelings. The three poems respectively embody the sublimity, momentum, and power of the mountains. Although they do not directly describe people, they actually powerfully praise people and their heroic spirit. The ancients said, "Express emotions through objects," writing about scenery is writing about emotion. Poetry and painting with artistic conception have a soul.

How can one obtain artistic conception? I think it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the object and to have strong and sincere thoughts and feelings.

The generation of artistic conception depends on thoughts and feelings, and the generation of thoughts and feelings is related to the depth of understanding of objective things. To have an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the object, one must be personally present and observe for a long time. For example, Qi Baishi's paintings of shrimp are the result of a gradual and in-depth understanding of shrimp through long-term observation and continuous expression. Only when one's understanding of things is comprehensive, reaching the level of "a complete horse in the chest," "bamboo in the heart," "blank paper facing the blue sky," and "creation in hand," can one grasp the spiritual essence of the object and endow it with life. We cannot imagine that Qi Baishi could have created works like today's by painting shrimp after just one glance. It is because he was extremely familiar with the spiritual state of shrimp that the shrimp came alive under the painter's brush. If one is unfamiliar or not very familiar with the objective object, one will definitely not be able to paint good paintings.

Writing about scenery is for the sake of writing about emotion. This point has always been very clear in the minds of outstanding Chinese poets and painters. Whether writing poetry or painting, they are required to stand higher than reality in order to observe and understand reality, so that they can be comprehensive and in-depth. For example, the opening two lines of Chairman Mao's "Qinyuanchun": "Thousands of miles frozen, ten thousand miles of snow drifting," fully embodies the poet's mind and the high realm of thought.

Chinese painting does not emphasize "light," which is not unscientific, but focuses on expressing the result of long-term observation. Taking painting pine trees as an example, from the perspective of Chinese painters, unless there are special time requirements (such as the morning glow or evening haze), eight o'clock in the morning or twelve o'clock at noon are not important. What is important is to express the spiritual essence of the pine tree. Like the Five Dynasties painter Jing Hao, who described pine trees in the Taihang Mountains, observing them day and night for a long time, "drawing ten thousand pine trees, only then did he obtain their true essence." In the past, I saw an artist going out to sketch, drawing more than a hundred pieces in two weeks. This, of course, could only be a fleeting impression; it was impossible to deeply understand the object, let alone create artistic conception. If a painter truly strives to express the spiritual essence of the object, then a single tree can play a leading role. I remember that there were four ancient cypress trees in Suzhou named "Purity," "Uniqueness," "Antiquity," and "Strangeness." Having experienced storms and lightning strikes, one large tree had fallen horizontally to the ground, like a giant dragon; however, its branches and leaves were luxuriant, and its vitality was strong, making people feel very young. After more than two thousand years, constantly fighting against nature, the ancient trunk was as firm as iron, and thousands of branches and leaves were reborn, making people feel its momentum and the power of the universe. A tree, a mountain, observing its spiritual essence, and through the exaggeration and rendering of the painter's thoughts and feelings, the artistic conception will be more distinct. Drawing woodenly will not produce good paintings. Every landscape has its own different characteristics, just like the differences in people's personalities. Sichuan people say: "Mount Emei is the most beautiful in the world, Kuimen is the most dangerous in the world, Jiange is the most majestic in the world, and Qingcheng Mountain is the most secluded in the world." This is reasonable. When we look at the scenery of the Summer Palace, it is magnificent and gives people a golden impression. A landscape painter must have strong, sincere, and simple feelings for the scenery they are depicting; telling lies will not work. Some painters, without deep feelings, without a strong desire to express their own personal feelings, always repeat others, so there is no question of originality of artistic conception.

Affirmatively speaking, painting must have artistic conception, otherwise there is no place to exert strength, but having artistic conception is not enough; one must also have artistic ingenuity. In order to convey thoughts and feelings, one must try every possible means. Artistic ingenuity is the design of expression methods and means of expression; in simple terms, it is processing means. Qi Baishi had a seal that said "Old Qi's skills," indicating that his paintings paid great attention to artistic ingenuity.

Artistic conception and artistic ingenuity are the two main keys to landscape painting. With artistic conception, but without artistic ingenuity, the artistic conception will be in vain. Du Fu said, "Artistic ingenuity is painfully managed," and also said, "A verse that doesn't startle the world is not worth writing." In order to convey their feelings to others, poets and painters must painstakingly manage artistic ingenuity in order to find artistic language that touches people's hearts.

### 山水画的意境

    山水画的意境
    画山水，最重要的问题是“意境”，意境是山水画的灵魂。
    什么是意境？我认为，意境就是景与情的结合；写景就是写情。山水画不是地理、自然环境的说明和解图，不用说，它当然要求包括自然地理的准确性，但更重要的还是表现人对自然的思想感情，见景生情，景与情要结合。如果片面追求自然科学的一面，画花、画鸟都会成为死的标本，画风景也缺乏情趣，没有画意，自己就不曾感动，当然更感动不了别人。
    在我们的古诗里，往往有很好的意境。虽然关于“人”一句也不写，但是，通过写景，却充分表现了人的思想感情，如李太白“送孟浩然之广陵”的诗句：
    故人西辞黄鹤楼，烟花三月下扬州，
    孤帆远影碧空尽，惟见长江天际流。
    这里包含着朋友惜别的惆怅，使人联想到依依送别的情景：帆已经远了，消失了，送别的人还遥望着江水，好像心都随着帆和流水去了……。情寓于景。这四句诗，没有一句写作者的感情如何，尤其是后两句，完全描写自然的景色；然而就在这两句里，使人深深体会到诗人的深厚的友情。
    毛主席的诗句，意境是很深的，如十六字令三首，每一首都是写景，每一字都是说山，但每一首、每一字又都充分表达了人的思想感情。三首诗分别体现了山的崇高、气势和力量，这里并没有直接描写人，实际上都有力地歌颂了人，歌颂了人的英雄气概。古人说“缘物寄情”，写景就是写情。诗画有意境，就有了灵魂。
    怎样才能获得意境呢？我以为要深刻认识对象，要有强烈、真挚的思想感情。
    意境的产生，有赖于思想感情，而思想感情的产生，又与对客观事物认识的深度有关。要深入全面的认识对象，必须身临其境，长期观察。例如，齐白石画虾，就是在长期观察中，在不断表现的过程中，对虾的认识才逐渐深入了，也只有当对事物的认识全面了，作到“全马在胸”、“胸有成竹”，“白纸对青天”，“造化在手”的程度，才能把握对象的精神实质，赋与对象以生命。我们不能设想齐白石画虾，在看一眼，画一笔的情况下能画出今天这样的作品来；而是对虾的精神状态熟悉极了，虾才在画家的笔下活起来的。对客观对象不熟悉或不太熟悉，就一定画不出好画。
    写景是为了要写情，这一点，在中国优秀诗人和画家心里一直是很明确的，无论写诗、作画，都要求站得高于现实，这样来观察、认识现实，才可能全面深入。例如毛主席的“沁园春”开头两句：“千里冰封，万里雪飘”，就充分体现了诗人胸怀和思想的高度境界。
    中国画不强调“光”，这并非不科学，而是注重表现长期观察的结果。拿画松树来说，以中国画家看来，如没有特殊的时间要求（如朝霞暮霭等），早晨八点钟或中午十二点，都不是重要的。重要的是表现松树的精神实质。像五代画家荆浩在太行山上描写松树，朝朝暮暮长期观察，“画松十万本，始得其真”。过去见一位作者出外写生，两个礼拜就画了一百多张，这当然只能浮光掠影，不可能深刻认识对象，更不可能创造意境。如果一位画家真正力求表现对象的精神实质，那么一棵树，就可以唱一出重头戏。记得苏州有四棵古老的柏树名叫“清”、
  “奇”、“古”、“怪”，经历过风暴、雷击，有一棵大树已横倒在地下，像一条巨龙似的；但是枝叶茂盛，生命力强，使人感觉很年轻的样子。经过两千多年，不断与自然搏斗，古老的枝干坚如铁石，而又重生出千枝万叶，使人感觉到它的气势和宇宙的力量。一棵树，一座山，观其精神实质，经过画家思想感情的夸张渲染，意境会更鲜明，木然地画画，是画不出好画的。每一处风景都有其各自不同的特色，如同人的性格差异一样，四川人说：“峨嵋天下秀，夔门天下险，剑阁天下雄，青城天下幽。”这话是有道理的。我们看颐和园风景，则是富丽堂皇，给人金碧辉煌的印象。一个山水画家，对所描绘的景物，一定要有强烈、真挚、朴素的感情，说假话不行。有的画家，没有深刻感受，没有表现自己亲身感受的强烈欲望，总是重复别人的，就谈不到意境的独创性。
    肯定地说，画画要有意境，否则力量无处使，但是有了意境不够，还要有意匠；为了传达思想感情，要千方百计想办法。意匠即表现方法、表现手段的设计，简单地说，就是加工手段。齐白石有一印章“老齐手段”，说明他的画是很讲究意匠的。
    意境和意匠是山水画的主要的两个关键，有了意境，没有意匠，意境也就落了空。杜甫说“意匠惨淡经营中”，又说“语不惊人死不休”。诗人、画家为了把自己的感受传达给别人，一定要苦心经营意匠，才能找到打动人心的艺术语言。
