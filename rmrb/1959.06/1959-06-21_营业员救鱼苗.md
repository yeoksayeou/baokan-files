Saleswoman Saves Fish Fry

One night, the electric meter hand on the wall of the Daoli Business Office of the Harbin Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau pointed to eleven o'clock, and the saleswoman Liu Yanhua was about to get off work. At this moment, a person came in from outside and said hurriedly, "Comrade, I need to send a telegram to Zhaodong. It's urgent." It turned out that the commune he was in had originally scheduled to transfer five million fish fry from the Laozhou Aquatic Product Farm in Zhaodong at six o'clock tomorrow morning. But the plan had changed, and the Laozhou Aquatic Product Farm had to be notified immediately, otherwise there would be no place to put the fish fry when they arrived, and they would all die. In order not to cause losses to state property, it was decided to send a telegram to notify them not to transport the fish fry.

Liu Yanhua thought to herself: There are only six or seven hours left before the fish fry are scheduled to be transferred tomorrow morning. If this telegram is not delivered in advance, how much loss will it cause to the country! So, she hurriedly helped the user draft the telegram and immediately went upstairs to find the duty officer to discuss it. Unfortunately, the Zhaodong Post and Telecommunications Bureau had already closed down and could not be called until seven o'clock the next morning. The user was sweating profusely when he heard the news.

"Comrade, is there any other way?" The user was so eager to find a solution.

Liu Yanhua comforted the user and said, "Don't worry, I'll think of another way." She finally managed to get the Harbin long-distance station to connect to the Zhaodong long-distance station.

One hurdle was overcome, but a new problem arose. It was still seventy miles from Zhaodong to Laozhou. Even if the telegram was copied, it could not be delivered in time. Liu Yanhua repeatedly explained the significance of sending this telegram to the other party. Sending the telegram was equivalent to saving more than 10,000 yuan in losses, and she asked the other party to think of a solution. The Zhaodong telegraph operator said: We can try broadcasting to Laozhou through the radio loudspeaker. But it's late at night, who can go to the fish farm to deliver the message? Liu Yanhua thought again, the farmers get up very early every day, if the broadcast is made a little earlier in the morning, it will definitely work. The Zhaodong telegraph operator accepted her suggestion and decided to start broadcasting at four or five o'clock in the morning. Liu Yanhua also entrusted the No. 41 operator of the Harbin long-distance station to remind the Zhaodong Post and Telecommunications Bureau at that time. At this time, it was already half past two in the morning. Liu Yanhua didn't feel tired at all. When she thought that this important telegram had a chance to be sent out, she felt very happy.

The next morning, Liu Yanhua received a call from the user and thanked her.

    营业员救鱼苗
    一天夜晚，哈尔滨长途电信局道里营业处墙上的电表时针已经指向十一点，营业员刘燕华就要下班了。这时，一个人从门外进来，忙冲冲地说：“同志，我要往肇东打一个电报。事情很急”。原来他所在的公社原订明天早晨六点钟，从肇东涝州水产养殖场调来五百万尾鱼苗。可是计划变了，必须马上通知涝州水产养殖场，不然运来鱼苗没有地方安置，就得全部死掉。为了不让国家财产遭到损失，所以决定打电报通知他们不要运来。
    刘燕华心里想：离明天早晨调鱼的时间只有六七个钟头，如果这份电报不提前送到，将要给国家造成多大损失啊！于是，她急忙帮助用户拟好电报稿。立刻到楼上找值班长商量。不凑巧，肇东邮电局已经闭机了，要在第二天早晨七点钟才能呼叫出来。用户知道了这个消息，急出了一头汗。
    “同志，还有别的办法没有？”用户多么渴望能找到解决的办法。
    刘燕华安慰着用户说：“您别着急，我再想想别的办法。”她好容易请哈尔滨长途台把肇东长途台接了过来。
    一关打通了，新问题又来了，从肇东到涝州还有七十里路，即使把电报抄下来，也不能及时送到。刘燕华向对方再三说明打这份电报的意义，电报打通了，就等于挽救一万多元的损失，她要求对方给想个办法。肇东报务员说：可以通过广播喇叭向涝州广播试试。但是，夜深了，谁又能到养殖场去送信呢？刘燕华又想，农民每天起得很早，要是早晨早一点广播，一定能起作用。肇东报务员接受了她的建议，决定早晨四五点钟开始广播。刘燕华又托付了哈尔滨长途台41号话务员，请她到时候提醒肇东邮电局。这时，已经是深夜两点半钟了。刘燕华一点不觉得疲倦。当她想到这张重要电报有希望传出去的时候，心里感到非常愉快。
    第二天上午，刘燕华接到了用户的电话，并向她道谢。
