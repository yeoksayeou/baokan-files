Many Grains Make a Tower

Comrade Song Xinzhi, a storekeeper at a certain military school of the People's Liberation Army, manages his household well within his modest means and saves a large amount of materials. If all comrades in charge of managing similar or larger households in national agencies, organizations, and schools could, like Comrade Song Xinzhi, diligently and consistently pay strict attention to saving, then how much financial and material resources would be saved for the country! The proverbs that have been passed down in our country to this day are: "Many grains make a tower," "Dripping water makes a river," and "Many furs make a robe," all illustrating that starting from small things and doing a good job of saving will, when accumulated, amount to a very astonishing number.

    聚沙成塔
    解放军某军事学校保管员宋心芝同志，在他所管的不大的家当中，管好家务，节约出大量物资。如果全国各机关、团体、学校负责管理同样或更大家当的同志，都能够像宋心芝一样，勤勤恳恳地始终如一地严格注意节约，那么，将给国家节约出多少财力和物力呵！我国流传至今的谚语是：聚沙成塔，滴水成河，集腋成裘，都说明从小处着手，做好节约，汇集起来就将是一个非常惊人的数目。
