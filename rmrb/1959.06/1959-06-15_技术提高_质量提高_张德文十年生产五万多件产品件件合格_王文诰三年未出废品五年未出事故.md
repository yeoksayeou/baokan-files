    Technical Improvement  Quality Improvement
    Zhang Dewen Produces Over 50,000 Products in Ten Years, All Qualified
    Wang Wen诰 Has Not Produced a Single Defective Product in Three Years and Has Not Had an Accident in Five Years
    (Our Dispatch) Zhang Dewen, a lathe operator in the tool workshop of the Jiangbei Machinery Factory in Jilin, has consistently maintained a meticulous attitude towards product quality for the past ten years. Among the more than 59,000 tools he has produced, the quality fully meets national standards.
    Since joining the factory in 1949, Zhang Dewen has carefully observed the blueprints before producing each product, analyzed the main key points of the product, and promptly studied and resolved any problems he found. Once, when he was processing the dual-purpose angled eye tool tire, he discovered that the dimensions of the angled eye pad and the straight eye pad on the blueprint were the same. Therefore, he consulted technical books and performed a series of calculations, which showed that the dimensions between the two needed to differ by thirty "dao" (a unit of measurement). Later, he, along with technicians and leading cadres, conducted a joint study and detailed calculations, proving that the dimensions on the design drawing were wrong, and the drawing was finally revised. He never overlooked any point he did not understand or suspected while studying the blueprints. For example, when processing the punch handle, the blueprint did not specify which punch press the dimensions should be matched to. He promptly worked with workers and technicians to study the issue until the blueprint was clear before starting production. The screw thread ring is a product with complex technical requirements. Each thread is only 0.8 mm apart. If the selection is not accurate, it will be scrapped. The surface finish requirement is also very high. After the workshop assigned such a complex and difficult task to Zhang Dewen, he carefully studied it, used a magnifying glass to push the cutter, and aligned the cutter with the thread. He pushed the cutter slowly, and gradually found the operating rules. No defective screw thread rings were produced. He not only carefully studies technically complex products but also never neglects simple tasks, ensuring that he frequently looks at blueprints, measures, and asks questions.
    Zhang Dewen also pays close attention to improving technology. In the past year alone, he has improved dozens of tools related to key quality factors. The production of four-head stamping dies requires precision machine tools, but the workshop did not have such machines. Zhang Dewen studied day and night, consulted with fitters and milling workers, and received strong support from the workshop leadership. As a result, he improved the lathe equipment and successfully developed a tire mold, making the quality and precision of the four-head stamping die fully meet the requirements. In addition, he improved the operating method of the top core go/no-go gauge, making the product quality reach 100% and increasing efficiency by more than two times.
    Recently, he has also successfully researched and developed six or seven key technological innovation projects. Improvements to the processing methods for medicine cabinet molds, internal ring processing methods, and spherical tooling all ensured quality and improved efficiency.
    Zhang Dewen not only avoids producing defective products himself but also actively tries to help young workers with low technical skills improve their skills and reduce defective products.

    (Our Dispatch) Wang Wen诰, an advanced producer in Changchun City and a lathe operator at the Changchun Instrument Factory, highly cherishes state property and takes product quality seriously. From November 1955 to the present, he has not produced a single defective product in the production of over 12,000 precision instruments. Furthermore, he has not had a single safety accident or machine tool failure in more than five years, making him a model worker for all-round leaps forward in quality, high output, and safety in the city.
    Wang Wen诰 came to the instrument factory as an apprentice in 1951. Due to the education of the Party and Youth League organizations and the help of experienced workers, his class consciousness has continuously improved, and he has established a high sense of responsibility towards state property. In this regard, the actions of those experienced workers in cherishing state property have had a great impact on him. In particular, in 1953, when producing a batch of sand mixer pressure rollers, Wang Wen诰 made five defective products due to a moment of carelessness. He calculated the cost himself: scrapping five pressure rollers was equivalent to a loss of more than 500 yuan. This loss may not seem large individually, but it adds up over time, and waste is quite considerable. Since then, he has learned his lesson and has been serious and meticulous in production.
    He analyzed the reasons for past defective products, which were all related to inaccurate measuring tools and inconsistent blueprints. Therefore, he focused his efforts on these two key areas. He arrives early every day to align the micrometers and calipers. After his micrometers and calipers are borrowed by others, they are recalibrated once they are returned. He is even more careful with the blueprints, and he repeatedly analyzes the blueprints of each product in advance. For example, when processing the hardness tester screw, after analyzing the blueprint, he found that processing this product required four processes: rough scraping, fire straightening, rough turning, and fine turning. His tools needed to be loaded and unloaded back and forth. A slight carelessness could result in defective products. Therefore, he and Liu Jichen and others studied using multi-head tools for processing, which not only ensured quality but also improved production efficiency. He also carefully measures the size of the raw materials he receives to prevent blanks from being the wrong size, resulting in defective products. During operation, Wang Wen诰 never leaves the machine tool without stopping it. His eyes are always fixed on the machine tool and parts, constantly comparing the processed parts with the blueprint. To prevent defective products, he leaves a margin for each part he processes. When approaching completion, he checks and then turns the last one or two cuts so that it will not be overcut.
    Wang Wen诰 pays great attention to the maintenance of machine tools. He often says, "To ensure product accuracy, it is necessary to strengthen machine tool maintenance so that the machine tool is accurate and easy to use at all times." During operation, he wipes frequently to keep the machine tool spotless and always pays attention to the sound of the machine tool to prevent malfunctions. Therefore, since 1954, the machine tool he has used has never had a single failure.
    Because Wang Wen诰 has worked steadily for years and made outstanding achievements in production, he has been elected as an advanced producer of the factory for thirteen consecutive quarters since 1956 and has been elected as an advanced producer of the city for three consecutive years. He has also been selected as a youth activist in provincial and municipal socialist construction. (Attached picture)
    Xie Jinzhou, an old worker in the tool workshop of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, is concentrating on making generator component molds. He has not produced a single defective product in six years since 1953, and he has overfulfilled the national plan every month. He has been rated as an advanced producer of the factory for twenty-four consecutive quarters.

    技术提高  质量提高
    张德文十年生产五万多件产品件件合格
    王文诰三年未出废品五年未出事故
    本报讯　吉林江北机械厂工具车间车工张德文，十年来一贯用一丝不苟的精神对待产品质量，在他生产的五万九千多件工具中，质量完全达到国家标准。
    张德文从1949年进厂以后，在生产每一件产品以前，他都细心地观察图纸，分析产品的主要关键，发现问题及时研究解决。一次，他在加工两用斜眼工具胎的时候，发现图纸上的斜眼垫和直眼垫的尺寸一样，于是他就翻阅技术书籍，并作了一番计算，计算的结果是两者之间的尺寸需要相差三十道。后来他和技术人员、领导干部又共同研究细算，证明了设计图纸尺寸是错了，最后修改了图纸。他在研究图纸中，有一点不懂或怀疑的地方，从不放过。如加工冲头把的时候，图纸上没有说明按照那个冲床配尺寸，他就及时和工人、技术人员一起研究，直到把图纸弄明白了，再动手生产。螺纹圈这种产品技术要求复杂，每个螺纹相隔仅零点八粍，如果挑不准就废了，光洁度的要求也很高。当车间里把这样复杂困难的活交给了张德文以后，他经过细致研究，用放大镜推刀，使刀对准螺纹，推刀的时候慢慢推，这样就逐渐摸到了操作规律，生产的螺纹圈没有出一件废品。他不仅对技术复杂的产品细心研究；就是简单的活，也从不疏忽大意，做到勤看图纸、勤量、勤问。
    张德文还十分注意改进技术。仅最近一年来围绕质量关键改进的工具就有几十项。生产四头冲模需要用精密的机床，可是车间里没有这种机床。张德文就昼夜研究，找钳工、铣工共同商议，又得到车间领导的大力支持，结果改进了车床设备，研究成功了胎具，使四头冲模质量、精密度完全合乎要求。另外，他还改进了顶芯的通止样板操作方法，使产品质量达到100％，提高效率两倍多。
    最近他又研究成功六、七项关键性的技术革新项目。改进药斗模加工方法、内环加工方法、车球面工具等项目，都既保证质量又提高效率。
    张德文不仅自己不出废品，同时也积极想办法帮助技术水平低的青年工人提高技术，少出废品。
    本报讯　长春市先进生产者、长春仪器厂车工王文诰，高度热爱国家财产，认真对待产品质量，从1955年11月到现在，在生产一万二千多件精密仪器中，没有出过一件废品，并且五年多没有发生过一次安全事故和机床故障，成为全市优质、高产、安全全面跃进的一名标兵。
    王文诰1951年到仪器厂当学徒，由于党团组织的教育和老师傅的帮助，阶级觉悟不断提高，对国家财产树立了高度的责任感。在这方面，那些老师傅热爱国家财产的行动，给了他很大的影响。特别是1953年生产一批胶砂混合机压滚时，王文诰因一时疏忽出了五件废品，他自己算了一下账：报废五个压滚等于损失了五百多元。这个损失单个看来虽然不大，但积少成多，天长日久，浪费也是很可观的。从那次以后，他便接受了教训，生产时认真仔细，一丝不苟。
    他分析了过去产生废品的原因，都和量具不准、图纸不符有关。因此，他就特别在这两道关口上下功夫。他每天都提前上班，把千分尺和卡尺对准。他的千分尺和卡尺被别人借用以后，拿回时都要重新校对一次。对图纸更加仔细，每一种产品的图纸，他都要事先反复进行分析。如加工硬度计丝杠时，经过分析图纸，发现加工这种产品要有扒荒、整火、粗车、精车等四道工序，他的刀具需要来回装卸，稍不小心，就会出废品。于是他就和刘积臣等研究，用多头刀进行加工，这样既保证了质量，又提高了生产效率。对领来的原材料，他也要仔细地量好尺寸，防止毛坯不符尺寸，产生废品。在操作中，王文诰从来没有不停车而离开过机床，他两眼总是盯着机床和部件，不断地用图纸对照加工的部件。为了防止出废品，他加工每一个部件，都留有余量，在接近完成时，进行了检查，再车最后的一、两刀，这样就不会发生车过头的现象。
    王文诰十分注意机床的保养工作。他常说：“要保证产品精确，就必须加强机床保养，使机床在任何时候都精确好使。”在操作中，经常擦拭，使机床一尘不染，并且时刻注意机床的声响，防止发生故障。因此，从1954年以来，他使用的机床从没有发生过一次故障。
    由于王文诰几年如一日地踏实工作，在生产中作出了出色的成绩，因此，从1956年到现在，他连续十三个季度当选为厂的先进生产者，连续三年当选为市的先进生产者，并被选为省、市社会主义建设青年积极分子。（附图片）
