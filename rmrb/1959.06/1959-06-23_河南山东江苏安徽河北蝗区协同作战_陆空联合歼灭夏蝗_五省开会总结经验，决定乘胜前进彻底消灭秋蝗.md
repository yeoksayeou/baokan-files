Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 22nd: The flying locusts that began to appear in parts of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hebei provinces from late April have been basically eliminated. During the locust eradication effort, the state dispatched a large number of aircraft, and local areas mobilized over ten million people, combining land and air operations to quickly win a basic victory in this battle.

To examine and summarize the great achievements in eliminating summer locusts, and to arrange and prepare for autumn locust prevention and control work, the Ministry of Agriculture held a locust eradication meeting of the aforementioned five provinces in Xinxiang City, Henan, from the 16th to the 21st.

These five provinces are old locust areas in China's history. This year, summer locusts occurred in 179 counties, totaling more than 18 million mu, a decrease of more than 11 million mu compared with the same period last year. The reduction in the area of summer locusts is the result of vigorously eliminating summer and autumn locusts in recent years, and with the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, the reduction of floods and waterlogging, and the gradual change of the natural environment in the locust areas, and the implementation of a comprehensive prevention and control policy for locusts. At the same time, in this summer's locust eradication, the state provided more technical support than in previous years, and the number of locust eradication aircraft dispatched increased fourfold compared with last year, with aerial control accounting for about half of the affected area. This greatly saved labor in areas with high locust density and alleviated the labor shortage during wheat harvesting and summer planting.

The locust eradication work in the five provinces received enthusiastic support from many regions and departments across the country. During the intense stage of locust eradication, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia and other places sent civil aviation aircraft to participate in the locust eradication. Relevant departments across the country sent a large number of technicians to the site to guide the work. Some units, upon hearing that the locust eradication aircraft were short of several parts, personally delivered them from thousands of miles away. Many pharmaceutical factories across the country rushed to produce a large batch of 666 powder in a few days, and the transportation department guaranteed transportation.

Under the leadership of the local Party committees and governments, the masses in the locust areas launched a massive locust eradication campaign. Each county established a headquarters, and each production team established a specialized group, dividing areas and assigning responsibilities, establishing a responsibility system, fixing reconnaissance personnel, and contracting for investigation and control. Adjacent special zones and counties in the locust area formed strict prevention and cooperation, and after repeated joint encirclement and suppression, the weakest areas for locust eradication in the past became the most thorough areas for locust eradication.

This meeting was a meeting to advance victoriously and march towards autumn locusts. The meeting called on all localities to continue to make good use of the experience of eliminating summer locusts in the autumn locust eradication. The time for the occurrence of autumn locusts is only about twenty days away, and the development of autumn locusts is fast, and the favorable control time is very short. The meeting called on all localities to actively rectify their teams, fully prepare all material resources, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate autumn locusts, and ensure this year's autumn harvest.

    河南山东江苏安徽河北蝗区协同作战
    陆空联合歼灭夏蝗
    五省开会总结经验，决定乘胜前进彻底消灭秋蝗
    新华社郑州22日电　河南、山东、江苏、安徽、河北五省部分地区从4月下旬开始发生的飞蝗已基本消灭。灭蝗中，国家出动大批飞机，当地动员了上千万群众，陆空结合，迅速赢得了这次歼灭战的基本胜利。
    为了检验和总结这次消灭夏蝗的巨大成绩，安排和准备秋蝗的防治工作，农业部16日到21日在河南新乡市召开了上述五省的灭蝗会议。
    这五省是我国历史上的老蝗区，今年发生夏蝗的面积有一百七十九个县，共一千八百多万亩，比去年同期减少一千一百多万亩。夏蝗面积的减少，是近年来大力消灭夏秋蝗虫，并随着农林牧副等各业的发展，洪水内涝的减少，蝗区自然环境的逐渐改变，对蝗虫采取综合防治政策的结果。同时，今夏灭蝗中，国家提供了比往年规模更大的技术力量，出动的灭蝗飞机比去年增多四倍，机治面积约占发生面积的一半。这就使蝗虫密度较大的地区大大节省了劳力，减轻了麦收和夏种中劳力不足的困难。
    五省灭蝗工作得到了全国很多地区和部门的热情支援。在灭蝗紧张阶段，湖北、湖南、浙江、甘肃、陕西、内蒙古等地都派来了民航机参加灭蝗。全国各有关部门派来大批技术人员，到现场指导工作。有的单位听说灭蝗飞机缺少几种零件，就千里迢迢地亲自送来。全国许多制药厂在几天内赶制了大批六六六粉，运输部门保证了运输。
    蝗区广大群众在当地党和政府的领导下，灭蝗运动声势浩大。各县成立了指挥部，各生产队成立了专业组，分片包干，建立责任制，固定侦察人员，包查包治。蝗区相毗连的专区、县之间结成严防协作，经过反复联合清剿，使往年灭蝗最薄弱的结合地区成了灭蝗最彻底的地区。
    这次会议是个乘胜前进，向秋蝗进军的会议。会议要求各地在秋季灭蝗中继续很好地运用消灭夏蝗的经验。目前秋蝗发生时间只有二十天左右了，秋蝗发育快，有利的防治时间已很短，会议要求各地积极整顿队伍，充分作好一切物力准备，坚决彻底消灭秋蝗，保证今年的秋季大丰收。
