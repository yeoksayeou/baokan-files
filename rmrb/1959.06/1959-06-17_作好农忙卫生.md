    Do a Good Job of Hygiene During the Busy Farming Season
    Summer harvesting and planting are carried out during the hot season. The hotter the weather and the more intense the labor, the more attention should be paid to hygiene. This is the only way to ensure the health of the labor force and guarantee attendance rates. The Ministry of Health has issued an urgent notice to health departments in various regions, requiring them to strengthen labor protection and actively prevent heatstroke, intestinal infectious diseases, food poisoning, and trauma in the fields. This is a very important task, and local health departments should immediately take active measures to cooperate with the commune Party committees to do a good job of publicity, education, and prevention and control.
    Currently, the broad masses of medical personnel in Beijing have been organized to go deep into the fields to actively carry out summer hygiene campaigns. Communes in Changping District have delivered heatstroke medicine and mung bean soup to the fields. Caiyu People's Commune in Daxing District has strengthened the promotion of hygiene knowledge through radio, blackboards, songs, and other forms. These measures are very important. Party committees of people's communes in various regions can, according to local specific conditions, prioritize tasks, and, with the help of health departments and medical personnel, seize the opportunity to focus on labor protection work to prevent heatstroke, injuries, and infectious diseases, overcome the hot summer, and ensure the victory of summer harvesting and planting!

    作好农忙卫生
    夏收夏种是在气候炎热的季节进行的。气候越热，劳动越紧张，越要注意做好卫生工作。这样，才能保证劳动大军的身体健康，保证出勤率。卫生部已经向各地卫生部门发出了紧急通知，要求加强动劳保护，积极预防田间中暑、肠道传染病、食物中毒和外伤。这是非常重要的工作，各地卫生部门要立即采取积极措施，协同公社党委，作好宣传教育和防治工作。
    现在，北京的广大医务人员已经组织起来，深入田间，积极开展夏季卫生运动。昌平区各公社把中暑药和绿豆汤送到了地头。大兴区的采育人民公社通过广播、黑板报、歌曲等形式，加强了卫生知识的宣传。这些措施很重要。各地人民公社党委可以根据当地具体情况，分别轻重缓急，在卫生部门、医疗人员帮助下，抓紧防暑、防伤、防止传染疾病的劳动保护工作，战胜炎夏，确保夏收夏种打胜仗！
