Sweeping Across Ten Thousand Acres of Waves in Three Years
By our reporters Jiang Qingzhao, Zhou Changzong, and Xia Weiyang

　　These days, the People’s Liberation Army stationed in the capital has dispatched large contingents to participate in the wheat harvest battle in the people’s communes in the suburbs of Beijing. They joyfully sing during their labor: In the fifth month, it's the Dragon Boat Festival, the people's commune has a beautiful landscape; the east wind blows the golden waves, the red flag flutters as we busily harvest wheat.

　　"If you need people, we have people; if you need vehicles, we have vehicles. We won't withdraw until all the wheat is harvested!" This is the slogan of the three armed forces stationed in Beijing. In recent days, the long-distance teams supporting the wheat harvest have been in constant motion, converging on the wheat-producing areas of Tongzhou, Shunyi, Miyun, and Changping. Tongzhou alone has gathered nearly ten thousand soldiers from the People's Liberation Army. They include soldiers from the army, navy, and air force, as well as students from various military academies. Some generals, led by General Yang Yong, and the sentries guarding Tiananmen Square have also joined the wheat harvesting campaign. After the various forces met, they warmly congratulated each other and launched a friendly competition.

　　Old Red Army veteran Colonel Jiang Cheng and Colonel Wang Guangde, who participated in the Great Production Campaign in Nanniwan, Shaanxi, led five hundred officers and soldiers to fight in the wheat fields of the Xiji People's Commune. They ate, lived, and worked alongside the commune members, leaving early and returning late, carefully harvesting and repeatedly inspecting to ensure that "not a single ear or grain is lost." In three days, they rushed to harvest hundreds of acres of wheat.

　　The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Engineering Corps School, who were praised as "pioneers" on the construction site of the Ming Tombs Reservoir a year ago, are now filled with the joy of harvest and have returned to the wheat fields irrigated by the reservoir's water to launch a wheat grabbing battle together with the commune members. This wheat harvesting army, led by Political Commissar Feng Zihua and Deputy Director of the Political Department Hao Zijing, worked early and late, rain or shine, and harvested more than two thousand acres of wheat in three and a half days. They cut quickly and harvested cleanly, ensuring that every grain was stored in the granary. The officers and soldiers of each company launched a heated labor competition and a grain-loving competition. The "Huang Zhong Team" composed of some older leaders and the "Mu Guiying Team" composed of female soldiers divided their labor and helped each other, working side by side, pulling and bundling, and their work efficiency was also very high. The officers and soldiers of the First and Third Companies, in the course of daily competition, continuously improved the efficiency of wheat harvesting, from an average of about one mu per person per day at the beginning to one and a half mu quickly, and there were also wheat harvesting experts Wang Xiaofang, who harvested three mu in one day, and Yang Wentang, who harvested six mu. They were voted by everyone as "wheat battle pacesetters."

　　Another wheat harvesting force in Changping District completed the wheat harvesting task for the Caihe People's Commune ten days ahead of schedule in just three and a half days. The soldiers of this unit harvested an average of more than one and a half mu of wheat per person per day, and they carried the harvested wheat from the wheat fields several miles away to the wheat threshing ground every day, solving the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity of the commune.

　　On rainy days, the soldiers of the army, navy, and air force still raced against time to "seize grain from the dragon's mouth" day and night. On the night of the 1st, when the wind and rain raged, the officers and soldiers of a certain company, after working during the day, still fought in the fields of Dongzha in Changping District in the rain. The rain became heavier and heavier, and the night became deeper and deeper. Wang Wenli, the captain of the Dongzha production team, repeatedly persuaded the soldiers to go home and rest, but the soldiers smiled and asked, "Is there any loss to the wheat if we harvest it in the rain?" The production captain said: "No. I'm just afraid the rain will damage the comrades' bodies!" Some soldiers said: "The wheat is fine, and the people's soldiers are even finer!" Their enthusiasm became even higher, and they fought with the commune members until dawn.

　　The officers and soldiers of the Eighth Company of a certain unit, who won the "Advanced Company" award flag in the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir project, went to the Heita Station of the Sijiqing People's Commune at night to help with the wheat harvest because they were busy with training during the day. As soon as they arrived at the wheat field, Squad Leader Shen Changxiang of the Fourth Squad of the assault team took the lead and worked hard. A fierce battle unfolded in the wheat field, cutting, pulling, bundling, and piling, everyone striving to be the first. The soldiers of each squad put forward the slogan: "Don't lose a grain, guarantee quality, catch up with the Fourth Squad." Hu Guoping, the squad leader of the Fifth Squad, came up with an idea to assign skilled people to three groups, and Zhang Zhenjiang, a member of the Communist Youth League and an expert in pulling wheat, introduced his experience to everyone. The whole squad quickly caught up with the Fourth Squad. In an instant, the golden wheat sea was opened with countless gaps by the warriors, dividing and converging, and working together to encircle and annihilate. It was not until the sun rose that they ended this intense labor, sang songs celebrating the harvest, and returned to camp in triumph.

　　The broad masses of the people in the suburbs of Beijing warmly love and praise the People's Liberation Army's wheat harvesting army. In the scene of the people celebrating the harvest, big-character posters and street poems praising the people's soldiers are posted on the walls of public canteens in many villages. The commune members also wrote many letters of thanks. Girls and children braved the scorching sun to send boiled water to the soldiers, and old mothers washed the soldiers' sweat-soaked clothes. On the wheat harvest battlefield of the Xiji People's Commune, the story of "Grandma Yu loving the Eighth Route Army" is widely circulated. One day, the soldiers were working hard in the wheat field for half a day. When they went back to rest at noon, Zhong Sixiang of the Third Squad found his socks drying in the yard as soon as he entered the door; when everyone entered the house, they found several pairs of socks washed clean, and the worn places were mended, and a snow-white shirt was folded neatly and placed on the kang. "Who helped do this?" It turned out that the landlord, Grandma Yu, didn't go to the fields yesterday because she wasn't feeling well. When she was cleaning the house at home, she found the soldiers' dirty clothes and dirty socks that they didn't have time to wash, and washed them clean one by one, and then sewed them up stitch by stitch. Grandma Yu is sixty-four years old this year, and her temples are already gray. Before she heard that the troops were coming to help the commune with the wheat harvest, she happily cleared out her own house overnight and cleaned the kang. After the soldiers arrived, she kept saying every day: "The Eighth Route Army helps us work in the fields all day long. How can we take care of these children?" (Attached picture)

    三年横扫万顷浪
    本报记者  姜庆肇  周长宗  夏维扬
    这几天，驻首都的人民解放军出动大队人马，参加北京郊区各人民公社的麦收大战，他们在劳动中欢悦地唱道：五月里来午端阳，人民公社好风光；东风吹滚黄金浪，红旗飘展收麦忙。
    “要人有人，要车有车，不收完小麦不收兵！”这是驻京三军部队的口号。连日来，各路支援麦收的远征队，车水马龙，云集通州、顺义、密云、昌平等小麦产区。光通州地区就会聚了近万名解放军。他们包括陆海空三军的战士，各军事院校的学员。以杨勇上将为首的一些将军们和警卫天安门的哨兵们也都参加了收麦战役。各路大军相逢后，热烈地相互祝贺并展开友谊竞赛。
    老红军战士姜成上校和曾经参加过陕北南泥湾大生产的王光德上校，率领着五百名官兵奋战在西集人民公社的麦田上，他们和社员们同吃、同住、同劳动，每天早起晚归，勤收细打，反复检验，保证“不丢一穗一粒”，三天中抢收小麦数百多亩。
    一年前曾经在十三陵水库工地上被誉为
  “开路先锋”的人民解放军工程兵学校的官兵们，现在满怀着丰收的喜悦，又回到受这水库之水灌溉过的麦田里，和社员们一起展开夺麦大战。这支收麦大军，在政治委员冯子华和政治部副主任郝子敬率领下，起早带晚，风雨无阻，三天半收割小麦两千多亩。他们割的快，收的净，保证粒粒归仓。各个连队的官兵展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛和爱粮竞赛。一些年纪大的首长组成的“黄忠队”和女战士们组成的“穆桂英队”分工互助，并肩作战，拔的拔，捆的捆，工效也很高。一连和三连的官兵们，在连日竞赛中，不断地提高收麦效率，从开始的每人每天平均一亩左右，迅速提高到一亩半，还出现了一天三亩的割麦能手汪孝芳和六亩的杨文堂。他们被大家评选为“麦战标兵”。
    在昌平地区的另一支割麦部队，仅仅三天半工夫，支援彩河人民提前十天完成了收麦任务。这个部队的战士每天平均每人收麦一亩半多，而且每天从几里路远的麦田里，把收的麦子扛到麦场上，解决了公社运输力不足的困难。
    下雨天，陆海空三军战士们仍然昼夜不停地向“龙口夺粮”。在1日夜晚，当风雨狂袭的时刻，经过白天劳动的某连官兵们，仍然冒雨奋战在昌平区东闸的田野上。雨越下越大，夜也越来越深了，东闸生产队队长王文礼一再劝说战士们回家休息，可是战士们笑着问：“在下雨天收麦对麦子有损失吗？”生产队长说：
  “没有。只怕雨淋坏了同志们的身子！”有战士说：“小麦没有关系，人民战士更没有关系啊！”他们的干劲更加高涨，和社员们一起大战到天明。
    曾经在修建十三陵水库工程中荣获“先进中队”奖旗的某部八连官兵，因为白天忙于训练，在夜里赶到四季青人民公社黑塔站，帮助麦收，一到麦田，突击队四班班长申昌祥就率领全班勇士，一马当先，大干起来，麦地里展开了一场激烈的战斗，割的割，拔的拔，捆的捆，堆的堆，人人争先。各班战士都提出：“颗粒不丢，保证质量，赶上四班”的口号。五班班长胡国平想出了主意，把技术熟练的人调配到三个小组，并由拔麦能手、共青团员张振江向大家介绍经验，全班急起直追四班。顷刻间，黄沉沉的麦海被勇士们打开了无数缺口，分进合击，协力围歼。直到旭日东升，他们才结束了这场紧张的劳动，唱着喜庆丰收的歌曲，凯旋回营。
    北京郊区的广大人民热烈爱戴和赞扬人民解放军的麦收大军。在人民喜庆丰收的景象中，许多村庄的公共食堂的墙壁上，都贴着表扬人民战士的大字报、街头诗。公社的社员们还写了不少感谢信。姑娘们和孩子们顶着烈日，为战士们送开水，老妈妈为战士们洗涤汗衣。在西集人民公社的麦收战场上，热烈传播着“于大娘热爱八路军”的佳话。一天，战士们在麦田里紧张地劳动了半天，中午回去休息的时候，一进门，三班钟思祥发现自己的袜子晾在院子里；大家走进屋时，又发现几双袜子洗得干干净净，磨破的地方已经补得好好的，连同一件雪白的衬衣，折得整整齐齐放在炕头上。“这是谁帮着做的呢？”原来是房东于老大娘昨天因为身体不舒服没下地，在家打扫屋子时，把战士们来不及洗的脏衣服、脏袜子找出来，一件一件洗干净，然后又一针一线地缝补好。于老大娘今年六十四岁了，鬓发已经花白。她在听说部队要来帮助社里收麦之前，就高兴地连夜腾出自己的房子，把炕打扫洁净。当战士们来到之后，她老人家更是天天叨念着：“八路军一天价在地里帮我们干活，我们可怎么来照料这些孩子们呢？”（附图片）
