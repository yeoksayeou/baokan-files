How to Reduce Cotton Bud and Boll Shedding?
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Cotton Research Institute
    Cotton bud and boll shedding is a major obstacle to increasing cotton production. To achieve high and abundant cotton yields, it is necessary to have enough cotton bolls, and first and foremost, more flower buds are needed. All measures adopted in cotton cultivation are aimed at promoting more budding, flowering, and boll setting, thereby obtaining high yields. However, the phenomenon of cotton bud and boll shedding has always been serious, so how to ensure bud and boll retention, and to allow cotton to set more bolls, is a very important task in current agricultural production.

    Based on an analysis of the flowering and boll setting habits of cotton and the causes of bud and boll shedding, bud and boll retention requires a clear understanding of water, fertilizer, light, and pest conditions throughout the entire growth and development stage of cotton. Grasping the main keys and taking comprehensive measures can promote early flowering, more boll setting, and larger bolls, to achieve the goal of increased production.

    In the main cotton-producing areas of China, cotton plants begin to produce flower buds successively in June, and flowering begins in July, entering the flowering and boll stage of cotton. This is the main period for bud and boll retention. The bud and boll retention measures taken during this period mainly include the following:

    (1) Appropriate Irrigation
    Appropriate irrigation can significantly reduce bud and boll shedding. In the cotton-growing areas of the Yellow River basin, there is often a period of drought in June, and in the cotton-growing areas of the Yangtze River basin, there is also a period of summer drought in July and early August, both of which require irrigation. This period of drought is followed by the rainy season, so irrigation should be especially cautious. Small and light watering or alternate row irrigation should be adopted to avoid encountering rain after irrigation. According to experiments conducted by the Huazhong Agricultural Science Research Institute in Wuchang, irrigation during the summer drought period can reduce the bud and boll shedding rate by 6.8%.

    (2) Timely Drainage
    Cotton's response to water is very sensitive; too much or too little does not meet the requirements of cotton growth and development.

    Every year during the flowering and boll stage of cotton, there are thirty to forty days of cloudy and rainy weather in the main cotton-producing areas of China. Cotton fields with high groundwater levels or poor drainage often experience waterlogging, which seriously affects the growth of cotton and causes bud and boll shedding. Therefore, timely drainage during the rainy season is very important in both the Yellow River basin and the Yangtze River basin cotton-growing areas.

    In the cotton-growing areas of the Yellow River basin, drainage ditches should be opened in the fields before the rainy season, and soil should be cultivated in conjunction with intertillage. Building four- to five-inch-high ridges before the rainy season can protect cotton from waterlogging during the rainy season. Cotton fields in the Yangtze River basin generally have good drainage systems and terraced fields, but it is also necessary to pay attention to regular ditch clearing and soil cultivation to facilitate drainage. Drainage not only drains rainwater on the ground, but also needs to lower the groundwater level in areas with high groundwater levels. According to experiments conducted in 1958 by the Beijing Institute of Water Conservancy Science and the Henan Yellow River Diversion to Wei Irrigation Administration Experimental Station, the groundwater level during the cotton growing period is suitable below two meters.

    (3) Topdressing during Bud and Flowering Period
    On the basis of applying sufficient base fertilizer, topdressing should also be applied in stages. The principle of topdressing is to appropriately control seedling fertilizer and increase fertilizer application during the bud and flowering period so that cotton does not lack fertilizer and shed bolls during the peak of budding and boll setting.

    According to the fertilizer experiments conducted by the Wanxian Agricultural Science Research Institute in Sichuan in 1958, on the basis of general soil fertility, appropriately increasing topdressing (nitrogen fertilizer) during the bud and flowering period can reduce boll shedding by 3% to 14% compared with topdressing during the boll setting period. In the case of relatively lean soil fertility and less base fertilizer application, appropriate topdressing of nitrogen fertilizer can reduce boll shedding and increase yield. Experiments by the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences have shown that increasing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used can reduce the boll shedding rate by 5% to 12.7%. In fertile land or when the base fertilizer is relatively abundant, appropriate amounts of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer should be applied during the bud and boll period, especially in soils with less phosphorus (soluble phosphoric acid content less than 60% mg per kilogram of soil), the effect of phosphate fertilizer is very significant. Experiments at the Jiangsu Xinshen Experimental Station and Binhai Cotton Farm showed that spraying phosphate fertilizer in the later stage can reduce boll shedding by 8% and increase production by 2.84% to 18.6%.

    However, topdressing should not be too late. About thirty days after the first to third fruiting branches at the bottom of the cotton plant flower, the number of flower buds is the largest, and a large amount of nutrients needs to be supplied. If the supply is insufficient or not timely, the nutrition of each flower bud will decrease significantly. Therefore, topdressing must be completed before spitting cotton, and the type, quantity, time, and method of fertilizer application must be determined according to the needs of cotton to better retain buds and bolls.

    (4) Frequent Intertillage
    Cotton fields should be intertilled frequently, and loosening the soil and weeding between plants is especially important during the bud stage. Deeper intertillage in July can inhibit excessive growth. In the high-yield cotton fields of the Fen勇社 in Quwo County, Shanxi Province, in 1958, two rows were left uncultivated as a comparison during the intertillage in July. The results of the observation were: the boll shedding rate of deep intertillage was 13.4% lower than that of no intertillage, proving that deep intertillage is effective for retaining buds and bolls.

    (5) Pruning and Topping
    Pruning can adjust the utilization of nutrients in the cotton plant, concentrate nutrients on effective buds and bolls, increase the boll setting rate, and increase boll weight.

    In relatively fertile cotton fields, leggings should be removed in time and the main top should be cut off at the appropriate time, which has a good effect on preventing boll shedding. Among the pruning techniques, topping is the most important. The topping time should be determined according to the growth status of the cotton plant, the local climate, soil fertility, and water supply. Topping too early will cause excessive buds to grow and fruit branches to grow rapidly; topping too late will leave several ineffective flower buds, wasting nutrients in vain. In cotton fields with insufficient fertility, topping should be advanced appropriately.

    (6) Disease and Pest Control
    Damage from diseases and pests is also an important cause of cotton bud and boll shedding. To prevent and control diseases and pests, it is necessary to prepare medicines and machinery first, and do a good job in predicting and forecasting insect conditions. From late June to early July, the targets for elimination are blind plant bugs, pink bollworms, cotton stem weevils, and red spiders; from late July to late August, the main targets for elimination are boll rot, leafhoppers, beet armyworms, pink bollworms, cotton bollworms, and cotton stem weevils. For prevention and control methods, favorable opportunities can be selected, and comprehensive prevention and control methods such as attracting and killing, capturing, and spraying can be adopted.

    (7) Protecting Flowers
    Cotton is generally self-pollinating, but cross-pollination has stronger vitality. Flowers that open on sunny and hot days have faster pollen maturity and a higher boll setting rate; while flowers that open on cloudy and rainy days with low temperatures have slower pollen maturity and more difficult pollination. If rainwater enters the flowers at this time, the pollen will often be destroyed. Therefore, cotton shedding is very serious on rainy days. Therefore, during the peak flowering period, it is important to grasp the time according to the weather forecast and the experience of experienced farmers, and close the corolla before rain, which can greatly reduce shedding. In 1958, the Hongwei People's Commune in Gaotang, Shandong Province, experimented that the boll shedding rate of flower crowns sealed before rain was 11.1%; for those not sealed, the boll shedding reached 86.1%.

    After the cotton flower opens and is fertilized, the corolla wilts and falls off after two or three days. However, residual flowers after rain often stick to the young bolls, causing the cotton bolls to rot, or tightly binding the young bolls, hindering the growth of the cotton bolls. A survey by the Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1958 showed that the cotton bolls that had their flower caps removed after rain in early August did not show any mold, while more than 50% of the young bolls that did not have their flower caps removed were moldy. Therefore, many experienced cotton farmers believe that removing flower caps is an effective measure to prevent boll rot and late boll setting. However, flower caps should be removed while wet; if they are removed after they are dry, the effect will not be significant.

    (8) Preventing Damage
    During field management work during the cotton budding and boll setting period, mechanical damage must be prevented. In short, bud and boll retention must take comprehensive measures from all aspects, on the one hand, adjust internal nutrition, and on the other hand, prevent external aggression and damage, combining internal and external, and comprehensively grasping, in order to reduce cotton bud and boll shedding.

    怎样减少棉花蕾铃脱落？
    中国农业科学院棉花研究所
    棉花蕾铃脱落，是棉花增产的一个很大的阻碍。要实现棉花高额丰产，就必须有足够的棉铃，而首先是需要有更多的花蕾。棉花栽培上所采用的一切措施，都是为了促使棉花多现蕾，多开花，多结铃，从而获得高额产量。但是，棉花蕾铃脱落的现象一向是严重的，因此，如何作到保蕾保铃，让棉花多座桃，就是当前农业生产上一件很重要的工作。
    根据对棉花开花结铃习性和蕾铃脱落的原因的分析，保蕾保铃需要在棉花生长发育整个阶段上，对水、肥、光、虫的情况有明确的了解，抓住主要关键，采取综合措施，才能促使棉花早开花，多结桃，结大桃，达到增产目的。
    在我国主要棉区，6月间棉株即陆续出现花蕾，7月间开始开花，即进入棉花的花铃期。这是保蕾保铃的主要时期。这一时期采取的保蕾保铃措施，主要有以下几项：
    （一）灌溉适当
    适当的灌溉能显著减少蕾铃的脱落。黄河流域棉区6月间常有一段干旱时期，长江流域棉区在7月到8月初也有一段伏旱时期，都需要进行灌溉。这一段干旱时期以后就是雨季，因此灌溉应特别慎重，必须根据气象预报，采取小水轻浇或者隔行浇灌，以免灌后遇雨。据华中农业科学研究所在武昌的试验，伏旱期进行灌溉，可降低6.8％的蕾铃脱落率。
    （二）排水及时
    棉花对水分的反映是十分敏锐的，过多过少都不合乎棉花生长发育的要求。
    我国主要棉区每年在棉花花铃期都有三十天至四十天的阴雨，地下水位较高或排水不良的棉田，常常发生渍涝，严重的影响棉花的生育，造成蕾铃脱落。因此在雨季及时排水，无论黄河流域和长江流域的棉区都是十分重要的。
    黄河流域棉区在雨季前，田间应开好排水沟，并结合中耕进行培土。在雨季前培四、五寸高的垅，可保棉花雨季不受涝。长江流域棉田一般都有很好排水系统和畦田，但也需要注意经常清沟和培土，以利排水。排水不仅排地上的雨水，地下水位高的地区还需要降低地下水位。据1958年北京水利科学院与河南引黄济卫灌溉管理局试验站的试验证明，棉花生长期的地下水位以二公尺以下为适宜。
    （三）蕾花期
          增施追肥
    在施足基肥的基础上，还应分期追肥。追肥的原则是适当控制苗肥，增施蕾花期肥，使棉花在蕾铃盛期不致缺肥脱铃。
    根据四川万县农业科学研究所1958年肥料试验证明，在一般地力基础上，蕾花期适当增施追肥（氮肥），比蕾铃期追肥的减少脱铃3％至14％。在地力较瘦施基肥少的情况下，适当追施氮肥，能减少脱铃，提高产量。浙江省农业科学研究所的试验表明，增加氮肥的使用量，脱铃率可以减少5％至12.7％。在肥地上或底肥较丰富时，蕾铃期应施用适量磷钾肥，特别在磷质较少的土壤（每公斤土壤含可溶性磷酸在60％毫克以下），磷肥效果十分显著。江苏新深试验站和滨海棉场试验后期喷施磷肥，能减少脱铃8％，增产2.84％—18.6％。
    但是追肥又不宜太晚。棉株下部第一果枝至第三果枝开花后三十天左右，花蕾数量最多，需要供给大量养分。如果供应不足或不及时，则每个花蕾的营养显著下降。所以，追肥必须在吐絮前结束，而且施用肥料的种类、数量、时间、方法等，都要根据棉花的需要情况确定，才能更好地保蕾保铃。
    （四）中耕要勤
    棉田中耕要勤，而且株间的松土除草在蕾期尤其重要。7月份进行比较深些的中耕，可以抑制徒长。山西省曲沃县奋勇社1958年的丰产棉田，在7月间进行中耕时，曾留下两行未中耕作为对比。观察的结果是：深中耕较不中耕的蕾铃脱落率低13.4％，证明深中耕对保蕾保铃有效果。
    （五）整枝打顶
    整枝能调整棉株体内养分的利用，使养分集中于有效蕾铃，提高结铃率，加大铃重。
    在比较肥沃的棉田里，应及时捋裤腿，适期打正顶，对防止脱铃有很好的效果。在整枝技术中，以打正顶为最重要。根据棉株生育状况，当地气候，土壤肥力和水分供给等条件决定打顶时间。打顶过早，会引起赘芽丛生，果枝猛长；打顶过晚，留有若干无效花蕾，徒然消耗养分。在肥力不足的棉田里，应适当提早打顶。
    （六）防治病虫
    病虫为害，也是棉花蕾铃脱落的重要原因之一。防治病虫害，首先要备好药械，搞好虫情预测预报。6月下旬到7月上旬，以盲椿象、红铃虫、金钢钻和红蜘蛛为消灭对象；7月下旬到8月下旬以铃病、叶跳虫、斜纹夜盗蛾、红铃虫、棉铃虫、金钢钻为主要消灭对象。防治方法，可取择有利时机，采取诱杀捕捉喷药等方法综合防治。
    （七）保护花朵
    棉花一般为自花授粉，但异花授粉的生活力更强。晴天高温时开放的花朵，花粉成熟快，结铃率较高；而阴雨天温度低时，花粉成熟迟缓，授粉比较困难。若在这时遇到雨水浸入花朵，花粉往往要被破坏。所以，在雨天棉花脱落很严重。因此，在开花盛期，应根据天气预报和老农经验，掌握时间，在雨前封闭花冠，可以大大减少脱落。1958年山东高唐宏伟人民公社试验，雨前封花冠的脱铃11.1％；未封花冠的，脱铃达到86.1％。
    棉花花朵开放授精之后，花冠经两三天就雕谢脱落。但雨后残花往往粘着在幼铃上，引起棉铃霉烂，或者紧束幼铃，妨碍棉铃生长。山西省农业科学研究所1958年调查，8月上旬雨后摘花帽的棉铃没有霉烂现象，而不摘花帽的竟有50％以上幼铃霉烂。所以很多有经验的棉农都认为摘花帽是防止烂铃和晚铃的一项有效措施。不过，摘花帽要趁湿进行，干后再摘，效果就不显著了。
    （八）防止损伤
    棉花蕾铃期间进行田间管理工作时，必须预防机械损伤。总之，保蕾保铃必须从各方面采取综合措施，一面调节内部营养，一面防止外力侵害与损伤，内外结合，全面掌握，才能使棉花蕾铃少落。
