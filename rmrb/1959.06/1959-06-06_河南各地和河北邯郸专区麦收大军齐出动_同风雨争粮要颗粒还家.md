Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 5th: The vast numbers of peasants in Henan Province are racing against wind and rain, carrying out a concentrated rush to harvest wheat in order to protect the first bumper harvest since collectivization.

As the wheat harvest in Henan just began, forecasts arrived that there would be widespread rainfall across the province on the 3rd. To protect the harvest, the peasants across the province, filled with fighting spirit, launched a round-the-clock emergency effort to cut and protect the wheat. In the Xuchang region, as soon as the forecast was received, a surge of transportation began immediately. In counties such as Shangshui, Wuyang, and Xuchang, over 530,000 people participated in transporting wheat on the night of the 2nd. Of the more than 6.28 million mu of wheat already cut in the region, 99% was transported to the threshing grounds; those not yet transported were stacked up on the spot. The Kaifeng region, upon receiving the weather forecast of rain on the 3rd, immediately mobilized 3 million people to urgently harvest wheat. By the end of the 2nd, over 4 million mu had been harvested, and 1.2 million mu had undergone initial threshing, with over 800,000 mu of late autumn crops being planted. On the 3rd, as the wind and rain arrived, the battle to seize grain from the wind and rain became even more intense on the thousand-mile wheat harvesting front stretching from south to north. In Yongcheng County, a 400,000-strong wind and rain prevention task force, in four hours on the afternoon of the 3rd, transported large amounts of cut wheat from the fields to the threshing grounds, and neatly stacked the 110,000 mu of scattered wheat on the grounds. By 11 p.m., when the strong wind and heavy rain arrived, the wheat in the fields and on the grounds had been stacked and covered.

From the evening of the 4th, the wind and rain in the province stopped from west to east, but forecasts indicate that there may be heavy rain again on the 8th and 9th. To this end, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a telephone conference of prefectural and municipal Party secretaries on the afternoon of the 4th, calling on the vast numbers of peasants in the province to seize the time in the three days of the 5th, 6th, and 7th, and concentrate their efforts to rush the harvest of ripe wheat, striving for a bumper harvest. The labor force participating in the summer harvest and planting has now surged to more than 12 million people, with more than 2.3 million livestock participating in transportation, and the daily rate of wheat cutting reaches over 5 million mu. While rushing to harvest, the emergency planting of summer crops has also begun. The area of summer planting in the province already accounts for 30% to 40% of the harvested area.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 5th: In the Handan region of Hebei Province, rain fell successively from June 1st to 3rd, with rainfall reaching 40 to 50 millimeters in four counties, including Yongnian. More than 1.1 million people and cadres in the region rushed to harvest wheat overnight in the rain.

After the rain on the 3rd, the Handan Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately convened a telephone conference to issue a mobilization order, calling on the broad masses of cadres and commune members to immediately rescue the wheat. Deputy Commissioner Liu Zhenbang, who was leading the wheat harvest in Shibeikou, Yongnian County, participated in protecting the wheat alongside the commune members. On this night, cadres at all levels and commune members in Xingtai County transported all of the more than 5,500 mu of wheat cut during the day to the threshing grounds and covered it well.
