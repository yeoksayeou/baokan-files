	Lightweight Explosion-Proof Switch
	The Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory has successfully trial-produced a lightweight explosion-proof switch. This model, QCB-30, weighs only 28 kilograms, a reduction of 92 kilograms compared to the original ⅡMB-1344 explosion-proof switch, and its volume is only one-third of the original switch. This not only reduces the physical labor for assembly workers but also brings convenience to coal miners. More importantly, it can greatly save raw materials for the country.

	Extracting Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) from Sesame Residue
	The Beijing Nanyuan Oil Pressing Factory has built a monosodium glutamate workshop with an annual output of 20 tons, using the by-product of oil pressing, sesame residue, to produce MSG. Every 100 catties of sesame residue can produce three to four catties of MSG. In this way, every 100 catties of sesame residue can increase in value from the past 6.1 yuan (as fertilizer) to 44 yuan.
	Making Cigarette Tobacco from Tobacco Dust
	Tobacco dust is waste material from cigarette factories. Recently, technicians from the Craft Group of the Tobacco Industry Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry successfully trial-produced cigarette tobacco by first making thin sheets from tobacco dust and then processing them into cigarette tobacco. They first rinse the tobacco dust with water to remove the sediment and sand, and then add carboxymethyl cellulose adhesive, pulp, glycerin, and other ingredients to mix evenly, making flexible tobacco dust sheets as thick as ordinary paper. These sheets are then cut into shreds, which become cigarette tobacco.

    轻便的防爆开关
    沈阳低压开关厂试制成功一种轻便的防爆开关。这种型号为QCB—三十的开关，全部重量只有二十八公斤，比原来的ⅡMB—一三四四型防爆开关重量减少了九十二公斤，体积只有原来的开关三分之一。这就不仅可以为装配工人减轻体力劳动，而且给煤矿工人带来了便利。更重要的是可以为国家大大节约原材料。

    从芝麻渣中提味精
    北京南苑榨油厂建成了一座年产二十吨的味精车间，利用榨油的副产品芝麻渣制味精，每百斤芝麻渣可产味精三到四斤。这样，每百斤芝麻渣可由过去价值六元一角（做肥料）增为四十四元。
    烟末制卷烟丝
    烟末是烟厂的废料。最近，轻工业部烟草工业科学研究所工艺组技术人员试用烟末先制成薄片，再制成卷烟丝成功。他们把烟末先用水过清，沉淀出烟末中的泥沙，然后加入羧甲基纤维素胶合剂、纸浆、甘油等混合拌匀，制成一片片如普通纸张一样厚薄的柔性的烟末薄片。再将这薄片切成丝状，即是卷烟丝。
