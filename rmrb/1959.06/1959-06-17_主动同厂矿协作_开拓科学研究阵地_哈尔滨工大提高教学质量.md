    Proactively Collaborate with Factories and Mines to Open Up Scientific Research Positions:
    Harbin Institute of Technology Improves Teaching Quality
    (Our Report) Harbin Institute of Technology, responsible for training industrial technology cadres for the country, is making full use of the superior conditions of the Northeast industrial base to carry out comprehensive cooperation with many modern large factories, greatly improving teaching quality and scientific research levels.
    Harbin Institute of Technology is a comprehensive higher industrial school with ten departments and thirty-five specialties. This year, combined with teaching and scientific research, the university is widely collaborating with relevant factories in cold and hot processing, new technologies, giant high-voltage power equipment, production standardization, automation, and testing and control instruments, researching and solving more than 100 important scientific and technological problems that are of great significance to improving labor productivity in certain industrial sectors or to the development of the national economy.
    Combining teaching with factory collaboration for scientific research is one of the important forms used by Harbin Institute of Technology to improve teaching quality and teacher levels. Last year, the school combined teaching with production, completed 354 scientific research projects, and collaborated with 670 factories across the country to solve more than 860 important technical problems. This year, it has further adopted the approach of "large-scale collaboration," where relevant business departments and their affiliated factories propose various scientific and technological problems urgently needed to be solved in production, and the relevant specialties of the school select suitable topics, determine cooperative relationships, or several specialties jointly collaborate with one or several factories outside the school to jointly design and trial-produce new products, study the use of new technologies in production, or summarize new and innovative technical experiences. At the same time, the school also organizes third- and fourth-year students to participate in more complex production labor in factories under the guidance of teachers according to teaching requirements, discovering problems and conducting scientific research; and organizes fifth-year students to collaborate with factories to carry out graduation designs in a real and practical manner.
    This factory-school cooperation method has opened up scientific research positions for Harbin Institute of Technology, enabling various departments and specialties to discover topics from production for original research. For example, after the Production Machinery and Electrical Equipment Teaching and Research Section collaborated with Songjiang Battery Factory and others last year, they discovered topics in production and successfully developed AC control equipment for electric arc steelmaking furnaces, quickly completing the scientific research project of "applying AC transmission in production," which could only be imagined before, and improved the level of teachers' mastery of AC transmission science and technology. Later, on this basis, they cooperated with Qiqihar No. 1 and No. 2 Machine Tool Factories to apply AC transmission to machine tool speed regulation systems, creating conditions for simplifying machine tool structures.
    At the same time, the results of factory-school collaboration in scientific research have also enriched and supplemented the teaching content of various specialties, or opened new courses. The Machine Manufacturing Technology specialty collaborated with Harbin Machine Tool Joint Factory to scientifically summarize the "building block" machine tool experience created by workers, and after completing the initial finalized design, the concept and theoretical analysis of "building block" machine tools were added to the "Machine Tool Design" course. The Welding specialty could only use four or five hours in the "Automatic Welding" course in the past to theoretically introduce "electroslag welding" and other latest thermal processing technologies in the world, but through collaboration with factories, comprehensive research was conducted on "electroslag welding" and promoted and applied in production, successfully welding China's first 72,500-kilowatt hydro-turbine large shaft and 12,500-kilowatt hydro-turbine seat ring with small pieces into large ones. Now, "electroslag welding" has been listed as a compulsory course for the specialty, with a rich 22-hour lecture, which is very popular among students.
    Harbin Institute of Technology has also learned from the process of factory-school collaboration how to better align the training of talents with the needs of industrial departments, and has correspondingly adjusted some of the courses in professional teaching. The Power Department transformed the Hydraulic Machinery, Boiler, and Steam Turbine specialties from purely design specialties to specialties focusing on design while also considering production, installation, and adjustment. The course content reflects the characteristics of Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, Steam Turbine Factory, and Boiler Factory as much as possible, so that the training goals are more in line with the requirements of the power sector. Facts have also shown that the quality of the talents trained as a result of this factory-school collaboration has been significantly improved. For example, most of the more than 700 graduating students of the school this year combined their graduation designs with undertaking national production and scientific research tasks, and the results they obtained were no longer just theoretical exercises, but showed practical skills. Among them, fifth-year students of the Electrical Engineering specialty cooperated with Shenyang Transformer Factory to design and trial-produce China's first large-scale electrical appliance - a 330,000-volt ultra-high-voltage current transformer; seventeen fifth-year students of the Machine Manufacturing Technology specialty, combined with their graduation designs, conducted technical analysis and summary of more than 800 "indigenous machine tools" created in the Great Leap Forward across the country last year, and designed a set of three-level, twenty-five new types of machine tools for rural use suitable for different levels of turning, drilling, milling, planing, and grinding. These machine tools have the advantages of simple structure, wide adaptability, and low cost. They have been put into production in eleven machine tool factories in Shanghai, Changchun, and other places. After summarizing the experience of designing this new type of machine tool, the students of this specialty also compiled a teaching reference book of about 200,000 words.

    主动同厂矿协作　开拓科学研究阵地
    哈尔滨工大提高教学质量
    本报讯　担负着为国家培养工业技术干部的哈尔滨工业大学，充分地利用东北工业基地的优越条件，与许多现代化大工厂展开全面协作，大大提高了教学质量和科学研究水平。
    哈尔滨工业大学是个拥有十个系三十五个专业的综合性高等工业学校。今年这个大学结合教学和科学研究，在冷、热加工、新工艺、巨型高压电力设备、生产标准化、自动化以及测试控制仪器等方面，正广泛地和有关工厂进行全面协作，研究和解决对某些工业部门提高劳动生产率，或对国民经济发展有重大意义的一百多项重要科学技术问题。
    结合教学与工厂协作进行科学研究，是哈尔滨工业大学用来提高教学质量和教师水平的重要形式之一。去年，这个学校教学结合生产，完成了三百五十四项科学研究项目，并和遍及全国的六百七十个工厂协作，解决了八百六十多项重要技术问题。今年更进而采取“大面积协作”的方式，由有关业务部门及其所属工厂提出生产上急待解决的各种科学技术问题，学校的有关专业就选定合适题目，确定协作关系，或者由几个专业联合与校外某个或几个工厂协作共同设计试制新产品、研究在生产中采用新技术或者总结新创造的技术经验等。同时，学校也按照教学要求，在教师指导下有计划地组织三、四年级学生到工厂参加比较复杂的生产劳动，从中发现问题进行科学研究；组织五年级学生与工厂协作，真刀真枪地进行毕业设计。
    这种厂校协作的方式开拓了哈尔滨工业大学科学研究的阵地，使各个系和专业能够从生产中发现课题进行独创性的研究。如生产机械电力装备教研室从去年和松江电池厂等协作后，在生产中发现了课题，搞成功了电弧炼钢炉交流控制设备，很快完成了以前只能空想的“在生产上运用交流传动”的科学研究项目，提高了教师掌握交流传动科学技术的水平。以后，他们又在这基础上与齐齐哈尔第一、第二机床厂合作，把交流传动应用到机床调速系统，为简化机床结构创造了条件。
    同时，厂校协作进行科学研究的成果，也使各个专业丰富和充实了教学内容，或开出了新的课程。机器制造工艺专业与哈尔滨机联机械厂协作，对工人创造的“积木式”机床经验加以科学总结，在完成初步定型设计后，“机床设计”这门课程里就补充了“积木式”机床的概念和理论分析。焊接专业过去只能在“自动焊”课中，用四、五个小时，从理论上介绍一下“电渣焊”这些世界上最新的热加工工艺，但与工厂协作，对“电渣焊”进行了综合研究，并在生产中推广运用，以小拼大地焊接成功我国第一台七万二千五百瓩水轮机大轴和一万二千五百瓩水轮机座环，现在已把“电渣焊”列为专业的必修课程，开出了二十二小时内容丰富的讲座，受到学生很大欢迎。
    哈尔滨工业大学还从厂校协作的过程中，摸索到怎样使培养的人材，更好地对上工业部门需要的口径，相应地调整了一些专业教学的课程。动力系把水利机械、锅炉、汽轮机三个专业，从纯设计专业变为以设计为主兼顾生产安装调整的专业，在课程内容上尽量反映哈尔滨电机厂、汽轮机厂和锅炉厂三大动力厂的特点，使培养目标更符合动力部门的要求。事实也说明，这种厂校协作的结果，培养出来的人材，质量显著地提高了。例如，今年这个学校的七百多名应届毕业生，大部分结合承担国家生产和科学研究任务，进行毕业设计，获得的成绩不再是纸上谈兵，而是显出了实际的本领。其中电器专业五年级学生与沈阳变压器厂合作设计试制成功了我国第一台大型电器——三十三万伏超高压电流互感器；机器制造工艺专业十七名五年级的学生，结合毕业设计，对全国各地去年大跃进中创造的八百多台“土机床”进行技术分析和总结，设计出一套三级二十五台适合不同水平的车、钻、铣、刨、磨等农村用新型机床。这些机床具有结构简单、适应性广、造价低廉等优点。已在上海、长春等十一个机床厂投入生产。这个专业的学生，在总结设计出这种新型机床的体会后，还编写成一本约二十万字的教学参考书。
