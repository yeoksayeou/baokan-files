    Carving without a Knife, Painting without a Brush
    The tea sets, pen holders, and other products produced by the Yixing County Purple Ore Arts and Crafts Factory are famous at home and abroad for their elegance. Recently, they creatively used plaster models to make various pictures and calligraphy, which are engraved on the products. The exquisite degree can be compared with products that are manually carved and painted. In the past, carving with a knife and painting with a brush took ten minutes to make one. Now, with a model, ten can be made in one minute, increasing work efficiency by ninety-nine times. (Zhou Hanqing)

    刻字不用刀绘画不用笔
    宜兴县紫矿工艺厂生产的茶具、笔筒等产品以雅致驰名中外。最近他们创造性地利用石膏模型制成各种图片字画刻印在产品上，精美程度，可与人工雕刻绘制的产品媲美。过去用刀刻和笔绘，做一个要十分钟，现在用模型，一分钟可以做十个，工效提高了九十九倍。　（周翰卿）
