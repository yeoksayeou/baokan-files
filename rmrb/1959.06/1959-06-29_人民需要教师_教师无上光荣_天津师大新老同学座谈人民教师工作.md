The People Need Teachers; Teachers Are Supremely Glorious
Tianjin Normal University Alumni Discuss the Work of People's Teachers

(Our report) Tianjin, June. Journalist Huang Xiao reports: Tianjin Normal University recently organized a series of alumni forums to help fourth-year students understand the work they are about to begin. At these forums, alumni who have already taken up their posts and those who are about to do so cordially exchanged their feelings about working as teachers.

Yang Chengxun, a graduating history major, believes that teaching is a glorious profession because his own life experiences have made this clear to him. He said: "For generations, no one in my family has ever been educated, and there was not a single college student in my village. When I was still in middle school, the agricultural cooperative asked me to go back to my hometown to teach. At that time, I thought: how many people are there like me, longing for knowledge! From then on, I resolved to choose the teaching profession. During my studies at the Normal University, while interning at a cadre spare-time cultural school, an old cadre with gray hair said to me: if you could assign a few teachers like you to our school, we would quickly learn culture! Another time, when we were doing social research at the Kailuan Coal Mine, the workers asked me: 'What will you college students do in the future?' 'Teach,' I replied without hesitation. The worker was very happy to hear this and said to me: 'Then, can a few of you come to our mine after graduation? We need teachers very much!'"

Of course, because one is still young and lacks experience, things will not always go smoothly when walking from the university gates to the podium. Many things must be explored and experienced on one's own, accepting the experience of predecessors and further enriching oneself, to gradually learn and master the work of educating people. Li Deyuan, who graduated in 1955, is such a person. In the forum, he recounted his early experiences as a teacher. On the day Li Deyuan arrived at the school, the teachers and students warmly welcomed him. He was assigned to teach two classes of Chinese and serve as a class teacher for one class. That afternoon, he began his first class. At first, he put on a serious face and taught the students very sternly, thinking that would make the students respect him. But the opposite happened, and as soon as class was over, the students ran away from him. Over time, Li Deyuan could not help but feel a little depressed. Later, an old teacher told him: you must understand the psychology of young people, you must live with the students. So, after the students finished class, he tried to talk to them. When the students went home, he sometimes walked a part of the way with them. After half a year, Li Deyuan was familiar with almost all the students he taught, and he understood clearly what the students did, what they thought, and their family circumstances. In this way, the students developed feelings for the teacher and spoke to the teacher without reservation. Li Deyuan said: "I have been a teacher for four years, and I feel that the responsibility is greater every year. I have gradually realized that living among the students, one must set an example in everything and be a role model. For example, when students are in self-study, I also study at this time. When students come to the teacher to ask about their homework, they see that the teacher is also reading, and they concentrate more on self-study."

At this time, Zhang Suyun stood up to talk about her experience. When she was in middle school, she watched the movie "The Village Teacher" and thought how wonderful it would be to be a teacher in the future. After graduating from university in 1955, she had a smooth start to her career. She started teaching in the third grade of junior high school, and she taught well, and it was at such a famous school—Nankai Middle School (now Tianjin No. 15 Middle School). In the second semester, she became a class teacher. As a result, she became a little complacent and no longer worked hard to improve her professional skills, and her relationship with the students gradually faded, and she began to lose the students' respect. The great rectification movement awakened her and made her invigorate again... She said with emotion at the meeting: "The road I have traveled in three years has not been smooth from the beginning. Only by truly overcoming your own shortcomings and loving your work can the career begin!"

Perhaps the greatest comfort to teachers and the highest reward for teaching is the letters that graduates write from all over the country and from various workplaces. These words are so familiar, childish, but full of confidence in life and remembrance of teachers... As a teacher, when reading these letters, it is like seeing the seedlings you have cultivated with your own hands grow into big trees and bear fruit, just like farmers seeing the harvest and workers seeing the glowing products! Chen Ruyi, an overseas Chinese student who graduated in 1955, was so moved that he shed tears while reading letters from his students at the forum.

This forum gave the graduating students, the future teachers, a vivid lesson. The position of teachers is important and glorious, and millions of students are waiting for them.

    人民需要教师  教师无上光荣
    天津师大新老同学座谈人民教师工作
    本报讯　记者黄晓报道：天津师范大学为了帮助四年级学生了解将要开始的工作，最近组织了一系列的新老同学座谈会。在这些座谈会上，已经走上工作岗位的同学和即将走向工作岗位的同学亲热地交换了彼此对作教师工作的感想。
    历史系应届毕业生杨承训，认为教师工作是一种光荣的职务。因为他自己所经历的生活使他看清了这一点。他说：“我的家几辈子没有念书人，村上没有一个大学生。当我还在中学念书的时候，农业社就要求我回家乡去教书。那时我就想过：有多少和我一样的人，渴望着知识啊！从那时起，我决心选择教师的职业。在师范大学念书期间，到干部业余文化学校实习，学生里有一位头发斑白了的老干部对我讲：如果分配几个像你们这样的教师到我们这里来，就会使我们很快地学好文化啦！还有一次，我们到开滦煤矿作社会调查，工人同志们问我：“你们这些大学生将来干什么啊？”“教书。”我毫不犹豫地回答。那个工人听了十分高兴地对我说：“那么，你们毕业后到我们这里来几个好吗？我们非常需要教师啊！”
    当然，由于自己还年青，没有经验，从大学校门走向讲台，不是样样事情都顺利的，有许多事要经过自己的摸索和体验，接受前人的经验，进一步充实自己，才能把教育人的工作逐渐学会、学好。1955年毕业的李德元就是这样的，他在座谈会中讲述了自己初作教师时的一段经历。李德元到校的那一天，师生们热烈地欢迎了他。分配给他的工作是教两个班的语文课，并担任一个班的班主任。当天下午，便开始了第一堂课。最初，他板起面孔，很严肃地给学生上课，以为那样学生就会尊敬他。结果却相反，一下课，学生远远地逃开了他。日久天长，李德元不免有些苦闷。后来一位老教师告诉他：你要了解少年们的心理，必须和学生们生活在一起。于是，在学生们下课后，他试着和学生们谈心。学生回家时，有时他还伴学生走上一段路程。半年以后，李德元差不多和他所教的学生都熟悉了，学生们所作的、所想的，以及他们的家庭环境，他都了解得清清楚楚。这样，学生们就同老师有了感情，对老师无话不讲了。李德元说：“我作教师四年，一年比一年感到责任重大。自己慢慢体会到了，生活在学生之中，一定要处处以身作则，树立榜样。例如，学生在上自习时，自己也就在这个时间学习，学生来向老师问功课，看到老师也在读书，自习就更专心了。
    这时张素云站起来讲她的经历。她还在中学的时候，看过电影“乡村女教师”，自己就想将来作个教师多好啊。1955年大学毕业了，她曾经是一帆风顺地走过了最初的道路。她一开始就教初中三年级，教得不坏，而且是在这样一个出名的学校——南开中学（现在的天津第十五中学），第二学期便当了班主任。于是，自己有点满足起来，不再刻苦钻研业务，和学生关系也逐渐淡了，开始失掉了学生们的尊敬。伟大的整风运动惊醒了她，使她重新振作起来……她在会上感慨地谈到自己：“三年走过的道路，不是一开始就到了平坦的道路上的。要真正克服自己的缺点，热爱自己的工作，才是事业的开始！”
    对教师的最大安慰，对教师工作的最高报酬，也许是那些毕业后的学生，从天南地北，从各个工作岗位上写来的信吧？这些字迹是这样熟悉，稚气，但充满了对生活的信心，对老师的怀念……作为一个老师，读着这些信的时候，就像看到自己亲手栽培的幼苗，长成了大树，结出了果子，就像农民看到了丰收，工人看到了发光的产品！1955年毕业的一个华侨学生陈如意，在座谈会上读着学生给他的信，激动得流下了眼泪。
    这个座谈会给即将毕业的学生、未来的教师，上了生动的一课。教师的岗位是重要的、光荣的，千百万学生在等待着他们。
