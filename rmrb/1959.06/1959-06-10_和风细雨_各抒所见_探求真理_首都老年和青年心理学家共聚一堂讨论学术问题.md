Gentle Breeze and Fine Rain, Each Expressing Their Views, Seeking Truth
Veteran and Young Psychologists in the Capital Gather to Discuss Academic Issues

(Our Newspaper) The psychological community in the capital held a scientific discussion meeting on the research object, task, nature, and methods of psychology.

This conference was jointly organized by six units: Beijing Normal University, the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, the Institute of Educational Science, Beijing Normal College, and Hebei Beijing Normal College. Psychology teachers from Changchun, Harbin, Guangzhou, Lanzhou, and Hohhot also came from afar to attend the discussion meeting. More than 200 people attended, including Pan Shu, Tang Yue, Guo Yicen, Chen Hanbiao, Cao Richang, Zhu Zhixian, Hu Jinan, Chen Yuanhui, Cheng Naiyi, Peng Fei, Shen Naizhang, Zhou Xiangeng, Chen Xuanshan, Sun Jinghao, Wang Lin, and Cao Fu. Before the meeting, Beijing units made serious preparations and wrote seventeen written speeches. During the discussions, both senior psychologists and young people engaged in psychology teaching and research elaborated on their views based on their research experiences, and debates were also launched on some issues. More than 20 people spoke at the general meeting. Debates were even more heated in the group discussions. The discussion meeting began on May 11 and ended on May 15.

Many questions were raised at the discussion meeting. On some issues, everyone's views tended to be consistent, while on others, there were still fundamental differences. One of the overall differences was: what is the respective position of psychological processes and personality in psychological research, and how to study them? This difference runs through several questions such as the object, task, nature, and method of psychology.

Regarding the Object and Task of Psychology

There are mainly two schools of thought. One school advocates that the object of psychological research is the reflection process; the other school advocates that psychology should study psychological processes.

Generally speaking, there are two schools of thought on the object and task of psychology. Both schools commonly acknowledge that psychology should study both human psychological processes and human personality. The difference lies in: one school advocates that the object of psychological research is the reflection process. Cao Richang from the Institute of Psychology represents this view. They affirm that personality should be studied, but believe that "personality and class nature should be studied from the reflection process." They believe that the main task of psychology is to study "the origin, occurrence, development, and laws of human reflection of objective reality." Therefore, it is necessary to "study the physiological mechanisms of psychology" because consciousness is a function of the human brain and is the human brain's reflection of the objective world. They pointed out that if psychology does not engage in research on the brain's reflection process, or does not study conscious phenomena from the function of the brain, it will make psychology equal to disciplines such as logic, philosophy, and the history of thought, and will cancel psychology. They advocate that in addition to studying the process of human reflection of objective reality and the laws of conscious activity in practical activities, psychology should also use cutting-edge science and technology to study the brain's reflection activities. Their focus is on studying the laws of psychological reflection, and they cited the work in labor psychology, medical psychology, and educational psychology as examples to prove that psychological research on the reflection process has solved practical problems and improved efficiency. The main force of current psychological research work should be placed on solving the research on the cognitive process. Cao Chuanyong and Chen Darou of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences supported this view. Shen Naizhang of Peking University also agreed with this view, but he believed that general psychology should specialize in studying psychological processes and need not study personality.

Another school of thought put forward different views. They believe that Cao Richang and others' opinions neglect the study of personality, neglect the social nature and class nature of human psychology, they advocate that psychology should study psychological processes, but "should study the psychological processes of living, individualized people," "should study the laws of the formation and development of personality in social practice and the impact of personality on psychological processes"; psychology should study the physiological mechanisms of psychology, study the functions of the human brain, but its main task is to study "the laws of the formation and development of human psychology in social practice." Chen Guomei of Beijing Normal University, Sun Jinghao and Cui Lifang of Beijing Normal College, Zhang Fang of the Education Administration College, and Hu Jinan of the Institute of Educational Science hold this view. Zhang Fang and Cui Lifang also cited some examples from educational practice, emphasizing the importance of studying personality and children's age characteristics.

In addition, Cheng Naiyi of Peking University believes that the object of psychology is human psychological activity. Psychology cannot study psychological activity without psychological content, nor can it study psychological content without psychological activity. Peng Fei of Beijing Normal University believes that psychology should study reflection forms, study the laws of how the reflection process is produced, how it is formed and improved in the brain, and also study the conditions for the formation of psychological content, the paths of development, and its impact on the reflection process. Zhu Zhixian of Beijing Normal University proposed from the relationship between general consciousness and social consciousness that psychology is the science of studying general consciousness, but it should also be combined with the study of social consciousness and class consciousness. He believes that psychology is different from historical materialism. It does not regard class consciousness as the superstructure of ideology, but as the dynamic structure of conscious tendency. It studies how different manifestations of class consciousness tendency are formed in the human brain, and how they affect human psychological activities and regulate human behavior.

Regarding the Disciplinary Nature of Psychology

There are four different opinions. The first is that psychology is a social science; the second is that psychology is an intermediate science that is biased towards social science; the third is that it is an intermediate science that is biased towards natural science; and the fourth is that it is an intermediate science that cannot be biased to one side.

Due to the above-mentioned differences in the object and task of psychological research, there are also several different opinions on the disciplinary nature of psychology:

The first opinion is that psychology is a social science. Guo Yicen of Beijing Normal University represents this view. In his two speeches at the meeting, he insisted on his view. He believes that psychology is the science of studying human psychological consciousness. Man is the sum total of social relations. Human consciousness is produced in labor. The human brain, as a psychological organ, is not a simple natural object, but is produced under social living conditions. Because the human brain has a second signal system, it is essentially different from the brains of animals. He advocates that human psychology is an active reflection of objective reality, human social practice is the basis for the occurrence and development of psychology and consciousness, and the objective reality reflected by consciousness is social life, not a simple natural world. Even pure natural objects have social significance to people. Psychology is a social phenomenon, therefore, psychology should also be a social science.

The second opinion is that psychology is an intermediate science that is biased towards social science. Zhang Zhiguang of Beijing Normal University believes that psychology studies the phenomenon of the interconnectedness of social forms of movement and life (physiological) forms of movement. The study of psychological processes mainly belongs to the field of natural science because psychological activities are the functions of the natural substance of the human brain in terms of mechanism and origin. The study of human personality mainly belongs to the field of social science because the psychological content of human beings is a reflection of the material living conditions of society and human social practice. Studying conscious phenomena and studying personality are the main problems of psychology, so psychology is an intermediate science that is biased towards social science.

The third opinion is that psychology is an intermediate science that is biased towards natural science. Cao Richang of the Institute of Psychology of the Academy of Sciences represents this view. He believes that psychology must study the origin of consciousness, psychology must study consciousness as the function of the human brain, and must study the brain's reflection activities, processes, and laws. He said that the human brain is the result of the development of nature, and the work of studying the laws of brain activity mainly belongs to natural science. However, he also considered that psychology also includes the part of social science that has no class nature, and also includes the part of social science that has class nature. Therefore, he affirmed that if someone focuses on studying the origin of consciousness or the process of brain reflection activity, and regards psychology as a natural science, it is acceptable within his research scope; if someone specializes in studying the tendency of consciousness or the influence of social living conditions on psychology, and regards psychology as a social science, it can also be agreed within his research scope. In his speech, he expressed that the reflection process that psychology should focus on studying does not change with social living conditions, therefore, he regards psychology as an intermediate science biased towards natural science.

The fourth opinion is that psychology is an intermediate science that cannot be biased to one side. Pan Shu of the Institute of Psychology of the Academy of Sciences holds this view. He disagrees with Guo Yicen's opinion. When analyzing Guo Yicen's view, he clearly stated that man is a natural entity and a social entity, and human mental phenomena are also a part of nature. He believes that being biased towards natural science will inevitably neglect the personality aspect, and being biased towards social science will easily neglect the study of psychological processes. His conclusion is that there is no sufficient reason to explain which side should be biased towards at present.

Regarding the Methods of Psychology

It is generally acknowledged that the experimental method is a method of psychology, but there are several different opinions on what position this method occupies in psychological research methods.

It is generally acknowledged that the experimental method is a method of psychology, however, there are several different opinions on what position this method occupies in psychological research methods:

Cao Richang believes that psychology mainly studies the reflection process, and the experimental method is a main method, while observation and description are old-fashioned methods. Because the level of methods currently used in psychology is not high, attention should be paid to using modern science and technology for research, so as to combine indigenous and foreign methods, and more foreign methods should be used in the future. Cao Chuanyong believes that modern cutting-edge science and technology and theories have provided many powerful weapons for the research work of brain activity. He said that electrophysiology, electronic technology, information theory, control theory, etc., all these theories and technologies are of great significance for revealing the laws of the brain's reflection activity. Guo Zhanji of Jilin Normal University agreed with the above opinions and advocated that the experimental method is an important psychological method.

Chen Guomei believes that the experimental method must be combined with other methods in order to reveal the laws of psychological activity.

Regarding class analysis in psychology, there are two opinions. Chen Hanbiao of South China Normal College and Chen Guomei of Beijing Normal University believe that class analysis is a principle, not a specific method. To be precise, the class viewpoint should be used in psychology teaching and scientific research; Chen Yuanhui of the Institute of Educational Science believes that class analysis cannot be done in the study of child psychology.

Regarding the General and Special Laws of Psychology

It is generally acknowledged that human psychological activities have common laws, and in class society, some psychological activities are influenced and restricted by class.

At the discussion meeting, it was generally acknowledged that human psychological activities have common laws, and in class society, some psychological activities are influenced and restricted by class.

Cheng Naiyi of Peking University believes that psychological processes are common to human beings. Human psychology is the reflection of the human brain on reality. As a function of the brain, all human beings also have general and common laws. Human consciousness in class society must be rendered with class colors, but human perception, thinking, emotion, and desires are not necessarily always related to class consciousness, and therefore do not necessarily have class nature. He believes that it is wrong to deny that human psychology has common laws and to study these common laws.

Zhu Zhixian of Beijing Normal University believes that in psychological research, it is wrong to deny the powerful regulatory role of class consciousness. However, exaggerating the class nature of psychology to the point of denying general laws is also equally wrong.

Chen Guomei and Wu Shujian, a third-year student of Beijing Normal University, believe that human psychology has common laws. In class society, some human psychology has class nature, and some does not. Psychology should not only study the common laws in psychological phenomena that do not have class nature, but also study the common laws in phenomena that have class nature. Duan Quanzhang of Hebei Beijing Normal College believes that psychology should study common laws, general laws, and special laws.

Many psychologists who participated in the discussion meeting said that this was a gentle and pleasant academic discussion meeting. At the meeting, everyone communicated academic viewpoints, expanded their knowledge fields, felt that there was much to be done, were very optimistic, and aroused the heart to work hard. Some people accepted some of the other party's views, thereby supplementing or modifying some of their own views, and some people found more basis for their arguments from others' speeches, thereby strengthening their original claims. Everyone saw each other's strengths and their own weaknesses to varying degrees, and felt that they must work harder to study, conduct research seriously, and accumulate some data. In particular, the young teachers and students who attended the meeting generally felt that they had a great responsibility and were determined to study hard, do solid academic work, and strive to prosper psychological science.

    和风细雨　各抒所见　探求真理
    首都老年和青年心理学家共聚一堂讨论学术问题
    本报讯　首都心理学界就心理学的研究对象、任务、性质、方法等问题举行科学讨论会。
    这次会议是由北京师范大学、中国科学院心理研究所、北京大学、教育科学研究所、北京师范学院、河北北京师范学院等六个单位联合举办的。长春、哈尔滨、广州、兰州、呼和浩特等地的心理学教学工作者也远道而来列席了讨论会。到会的有潘菽、唐钺、郭一岑、陈汉标、曹日昌、朱智贤、胡寄南、陈元辉、程乃颐、彭飞、沈乃璋、周先庚、陈选善、孙经灏、王琳、曹孚等二百多人。会前北京各单位作了认真准备，写出了书面发言十七篇。在讨论中年老的心理学家和参加心理学教学和研究工作的青年都按照自己的研究心得论述了自己的观点，对一些问题也展开了争论。大会上先后发言的有二十多人。在小组讨论中争辩更为热烈。讨论会于5月11日开始，15日结束。
    讨论会上提出的问题很多，有些问题大家看法已趋向一致，有些问题还有原则性的分歧。其中一个总的分歧就是：心理过程和个性在心理学的研究中各占什么地位，以及如何去研究。这个分歧贯串在心理学的对象、任务、性质、方法等几个问题中。
    关于心理学的对象与任务
    主要有两派意见。一派主张心理学研究的对象是反映过程；另一派则主张心理学应该研究心理过程。
    关于心理学的对象与任务，总的说来有两派意见。两派共同承认心理学既要研究人的心理过程，也要研究人的个性，所不同的是：一派主张心理学研究的对象是反映过程，持这种意见的以心理研究所的曹日昌为代表，他们肯定个性应该研究，但认为“应该从反映过程来研究个性和阶级性”。他们认为：心理学的主要任务是研究“意识的起源、发生、发展和人对客观现实的反映及其规律”，因此必须“研究心理的生理机制”，因为意识是人脑的机能，是人脑对客观世界的反映。他们指出，心理学如果不从事关于脑的反映过程的研究，或不从脑的机能来研究意识现象，就会使心理学等于逻辑学、哲学、思想史等学科，就取消了心理学。他们主张心理学除在实践活动中研究人对客观现实的反映过程和意识活动的规律外，还要利用尖端科学技术来研究脑的反映活动。他们的着重点是研究心理反映的规律，并举了劳动心理、医学心理、教育心理等方面的工作为例，证明心理学研究反映过程，解决了实际问题，提高了效率。目前心理学研究工作的主要力量应放在解决认识过程的研究上。支持这种意见的有中国科学院心理研究所曹传咏、陈大柔，北京大学沈乃璋也同意这种意见，但他认为，普通心理学应该专门研究心理过程，不必研究个性。
    另一派提出了不同的看法。他们认为曹日昌等人的意见，忽视了对个性的研究，忽视了人的心理的社会性和阶级性，他们主张心理学应该研究心理过程，但是“应该研究活生生的、具有个性的人的心理过程”，“应该研究个性在社会实践中形成和发展的规律和个性对于心理过程的影响”；心理学应该研究心理的生理机制，研究人脑的机能，但是它的主要任务是研究“人的心理在社会实践中形成和发展的规律”。持这种主张的有北京师范大学陈帼眉，北京师范学院孙经灏、崔莉芳、教育行政学院张昉，教育科学研究所胡寄南等人。张昉和崔莉芳并举了一些教育实践中的例子，强调说明研究个性和儿童年龄特征的重要意义。
    此外，北京大学程乃颐认为，心理学的对象是人的心理活动，心理学不可以脱离心理内容研究心理活动，但也不可以脱离心理活动研究心理内容。北京师范大学彭飞认为：心理学要研究反映形式，研究反映过程如何产生、如何在脑中形成和完善起来的规律，也要研究心理内容形成的条件、发展的途径及其对反映过程的影响。北京师范大学朱智贤从一般意识和社会意识的关系上，提出心理学是研究一般意识的科学，但也应结合着研究社会意识、阶级意识。他认为：心理学和历史唯物主义不同，它不是把阶级意识当作意识形态的上层建筑来研究，而是作为意识倾向的动力结构来研究，是研究阶级意识倾向的不同表现形态在人脑中如何形成起来，又如何影响着人的心理活动和调节人的行为。
    关于心理学的学科性质
    有四种不同意见。第一种认为心理学是社会科学；第二种认为心理学是偏于社会科学的中间科学；第三种说是偏于自然科学的中间科学；第四种说是不能偏在一边的中间科学。
    由于对心理学研究的对象与任务存在着上述分歧，对心理学的学科性质也有几种不同的意见：
    第一种意见认为心理学是社会科学。以北京师范大学郭一岑为代表，他在会上的两次发言中，坚持了他的看法。他认为，心理学是研究人的心理意识的科学。人是社会关系的总合。人的意识是在劳动中产生的。作为心理器官的人脑，不是单纯的自然物，而是在社会生活条件下产生的。由于人脑具有第二信号系统，本质上已区别于动物的脑。他主张人的心理是对客观现实的能动反映，人的社会实践是心理、意识发生和发展的基础，意识所反映的客观现实，是社会生活，不是单纯的自然界，即使纯自然物，对人来讲也具有社会意义。心理是社会现象，因此，心理学也应是一门社会科学。
    第二种意见认为心理学是偏于社会科学的中间科学。北京师范大学章志光认为，心理学所研究的是社会运动形态与生命（生理）运动形态相互联系的现象，其中研究心理过程主要属于自然科学领域，因为心理活动就其机制和起源来说，是人脑这块自然物质的机能。研究人的个性，则主要属于社会科学领域，因为人的心理内容是社会物质生活条件、人类的社会实践的反映。研究意识现象，研究个性是心理学的主要问题，所以心理学是偏于社会科学的中间科学。
    第三种意见认为，心理学是偏于自然科学的中间科学。以科学院心理研究所曹日昌为代表。他认为心理学要研究意识的起源，心理学要研究作为人脑机能的意识，要研究脑的反映活动、过程与规律。他说，人脑是自然界发展的结果，研究脑的活动规律的工作，重点属于自然科学。但他也考虑到，心理学又包括没有阶级性的社会科学部分，也包括有阶级性的社会科学部分，所以，他肯定：如果有人着重研究意识起源、或脑的反映活动过程，把心理学当作一种自然科学，在他的研究范围内未尝不可；如果有人专门研究意识倾向性或社会生活条件对心理的影响，把心理学当做一门社会科学，在他的研究范围内也可同意。他在发言中表示心理学应着重研究的反映过程是不随社会生活条件变化而变化的，因此，他把心理学看成为偏于自然科学方面的中间科学。
    第四种意见认为，心理学是不能偏在一边的中间科学。科学院心理研究所潘菽持有这种观点。他不同意郭一岑的意见，他在分析郭一岑的观点时，明确表示：人是自然实体，也是社会实体，人的精神现象也是自然界的一部分。他认为，偏于自然科学，则必然忽视个性方面，偏于社会科学，则易忽视心理过程的研究。他的结论是：目前还没有充分理由能说明应偏向那一边。
    关于心理学的方法
    一般都承认实验法是心理学的一种方法，但这种方法在心理学研究方法中占什么地位，则有几种不同意见。
    一般都承认实验法是心理学的一种方法，然而这种方法在心理学研究方法中占什么地位，则有几种不同的意见：
    曹日昌认为，心理学主要是研究反映过程，实验法是一种主要的方法，观察、描述则是一种古老的土办法。由于目前心理学所用的方法水平还不高，应该注意应用现代科学技术来进行研究，做到土洋结合，而将来应多用洋办法。曹传咏认为，近代尖端科学技术和理论，给大脑活动的研究工作提供了许多有力的武器。他说，电生理学、电子技术、信息论、控制论等，所有这些理论和技术，对于揭露脑的反映活动的规律都具有重要的意义。吉林师范大学郭占基同意以上意见，并主张实验法是一种重要的心理学方法。
    陈帼眉认为，实验法必须与其他方法配合起来，才能揭露心理活动的规律。
    关于心理学中的阶级分析，有二种意见。华南师范学院陈汉彪、北京师大陈帼眉认为，阶级分析是原则、不是具体方法，确切些说，应当是在心理学教学和科学研究中运用阶级观点；教育科学研究所陈元辉认为对儿童心理的研究不能作阶级分析。
    关于心理的一般规律和特殊规律
    一般都承认人的心理活动有共同规律，在阶级社会里，部分的心理活动是受阶级影响和制约的。
    讨论会上，一般都承认人的心理活动有共同规律，在阶级社会里，部分的心理活动是受阶级影响和制约的。
    北大程乃颐认为：心理过程是人类共同的，人的心理是人脑对现实的反映，作为脑的机能，全人类也有一般的、共同的规律。人的意识在阶级社会中必定渲染上阶级色彩，但是人的感知、思惟、情感、愿望等，不一定每次都和阶级意识联系，因而也就不一定都有阶级性。他认为，否认人的心理有共同规律和研究这些共同规律是错误的。
    北京师大朱智贤认为：在心理学研究中，否认阶级意识的强大调节作用，是不对的。但夸大心理的阶级性，以至否认一般规律，也同样是错误的。
    北京师大陈帼眉及三年级学生吴书柬认为，人的心理有共同规律。在阶级社会中人的心理有些有阶级性，有些没有阶级性。心理学既要研究在没有阶级性的心理现象中的共同规律，还要研究在具有阶级性的现象中的共同规律。河北北京师范学院段铨章认为，心理学应该研究共同规律、一般规律和特殊规律。
    许多参加讨论会的心理学工作者说：这是一次惠风和畅的学术讨论会。会上大家沟通了学术观点，扩大了知识领域，觉得大有可为，很乐观，激起了发奋之心。有的人接受了对方的一些观点，从而补充或修改了自己的某些看法，有的人从别人的发言中，给自己的论点找到了更多的根据，因而更坚定了原来的主张。大家都程度不同地看到对方之所长，自己之所短，感到必须再下苦工夫钻研，认真作些研究，积累些资料才行。特别是与会的青年师生，普遍感到责任重大，决心好好读书，切切实实做学问，为繁荣心理科学而努力。
