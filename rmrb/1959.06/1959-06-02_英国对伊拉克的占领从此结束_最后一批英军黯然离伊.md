Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, May 31st. The last batch of 89 British air force personnel occupying Iraq left Iraq this morning, ending the occupation of Iraq by British imperialists, which had been maintained in various forms since 1914.

At Baghdad Airport, only the British Ambassador to Iraq, Sir Humphrey Trevelyan, stood alone watching these people withdraw from Iraq.

As he was about to leave, a British soldier told reporters, "It is right for the Iraqi people to ask us to leave. They have the right to independence."

The 89 people who left Iraq for Cyprus today were all British air force personnel stationed at the Habbaniya base. Originally, there were more than 1,000 British air force personnel and their families stationed at this base. The British Air Force was stationed there under a "Special Agreement" signed in 1955 between Britain and the former traitorous regime of Iraq. After the Iraqi government announced its withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact in March of this year, the "Special Agreement" signed under Article 1 of the Baghdad Pact was also abolished. On March 30, the British government was forced to announce the withdrawal of its air force from the Habbaniya base. (Attached picture)

    英国对伊拉克的占领从此结束
    最后一批英军黯然离伊
    新华社巴格达31日电　强占伊拉克的最后一批英国空军八十九人今天上午离开伊拉克，从而结束了英帝国主义者1914年以来用各种方式一直维持的对伊拉克的占领。
    在巴格达机场上，只有英国驻伊拉克大使杜威廉孤零零地看着这些人撤出伊拉克。
    一个英国士兵在临离开时对新闻记者说，“伊拉克人民要求我们离开是正当的。他们有独立的权利”。
    今天离开伊拉克前往塞浦路斯的八十九人都是驻在哈巴尼雅基地的英国空军人员。原来驻在这个基地的英空军和家属多达一千多人。英国空军是根据1955年英国同伊拉克前卖国政权签订的一个“特别协定”而驻扎那里的。在伊拉克政府今年3月间宣布退出巴格达条约后，作为根据巴格达条约第一条规定而签订的“特别协定”也就随之废除。英国政府在3月30日被迫宣布把它的空军撤出哈巴尼雅基地。（附图片）
