    Carving Wood to Seek Fish
    Wang Xieshan

    How can one gather fish in the vast ocean for netting? This is a problem that fishermen must solve.

    Most people think that to lure fish, one must scatter fragrant and delicious bait, taking advantage of the fish's gluttony to entice them into the net. As the saying goes, "Prepare a powerful crossbow to shoot tigers, arrange fragrant bait to catch soft-shelled turtles."

    In fact, fish have different habits, and if people understand their characteristics, they don't necessarily have to use bait to lure them. Along the coast of Zhejiang, there is a kind of gray-black pomfret. This fish likes to gather in groups and has a strong ability to imitate. Local fishermen use this characteristic. During the flood season, they carve wooden figures resembling pomfret, paint them gray-black all over, and tie them to the stern of the fishing boat. When the fishing boat moves in the water, the wooden fish follows, and the real pomfret, seeing it as its own kind, follows along, one after another, attracting a large group. The fishermen, watching these duped fish, are secretly pleased, cast their nets, and catch them all in one swoop.

    This "carving wood to seek fish" method of fishing, upon careful examination, is actually very old. Wang Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty, in his book "Lunheng" in the chapter "Chaotic Dragons," said, "Anglers use wood to make fish, paint their bodies red, place them near the water flow, and strike them to create movement. The fish think it is real and gather together."

    Wang Chong lived from 27 to 97 AD, and his hometown was present-day Shangyu County in Zhejiang Province. Shangyu County is very close to the sea. The "carving wood to seek fish" method that Wang Chong described was likely learned from the fishermen along the coast.

    I heard that not long ago, fishermen in Xiamen Port learned and adopted this method, and combined with other measures, the production of pomfret has greatly increased.

    In modern fishing, there are also similar methods. Wood has been replaced by rubber. Rubber fake fish are naturally more realistic and more likely to fool the fish. Fishermen place these rubber fish around the fishing nets and make them move around. Passing fish, seeing this, also follow suit, circling around. By the time the fish realize they are trapped, they are already out of their control.

    Recently, the Department of Biology at Moscow University discovered in the Black Sea that fish can emit ultrasonic waves that humans cannot hear, which is the language of fish. If people record the language of fish with a microphone and then play it in the water with a special "phonograph," the fish, hearing the sounds of their own kind, will gather from all directions without invitation. If this method is combined with the "carving wood to seek fish" method, then fishing will naturally be more effective with less effort.

    刻木求鱼
    王燮山
    茫茫的大海，怎样才能使鱼儿聚在一起，加以兜捕？这是渔人必须解决的问题。
    一般人以为引诱鱼儿，必须撒下香美可口的诱饵，利用鱼儿的贪吃，诱使它们落网。俗语说得好：“准备窝弓射猛虎，安排香饵钓鳌鱼。”
    其实，鱼的习性各个不同，人们如果掌握了它们的特性，就不一定要用钓饵去引诱。浙江沿海有一种灰黑色的乌鲳鱼。这种鱼很喜欢合群，模仿力也很强。当地的渔民利用它们的这一特性，每当汛期，用木头雕刻成乌鲳鱼的样子，浑身涂成灰黑色，把它系在渔船的后尾。当渔船在水中前进的时候，木鱼跟着游动，真的乌鲳鱼看见了，以为是同类，就跟着游动起来，一个接着一个，招来了一大批。渔人们眼看着这些上当的鱼儿，心里暗暗高兴，撒下网去，把它们一网打尽。
    这种“刻木求鱼”的捕鱼方法，仔细稽考起来，倒是很古老的。东汉时代的王充，在他写的“论衡”一书的“乱龙篇”中，说道：“钓者以木为鱼，丹漆其身，近之水流，而击之起水动作。鱼以为真，并来聚会。”
    王充是公元二十七年至九十七年间人，他的家乡就是现在的浙江省上虞县。上虞县离海很近。王充记述的“刻木求鱼”的方法大抵是从沿海的渔民那儿得来的。
    听说前不久厦门港的渔民学习和采用了这个方法，并配合其他的措施，乌鲳鱼的产量有很大的增加。
    在近代化的捕鱼业中，也有类似这样的方法。木头被橡胶代替了。橡胶做的假鱼自然更逼真更能使鱼儿上当。捕鱼的人们在渔网周围布置一些这种橡胶鱼，并使它们绕来绕去，过往的鱼儿看到了，也学着样子大兜其圈子，待到鱼儿们发现中了圈套的时候，已身不由己了。
    最近，莫斯科大学生物系在黑海发现，鱼在水中能够发出一种人所听不见的超声波，这就是鱼的语言；人们如果用微音器把鱼的语言录音下来，再在水中用特制的“话匣子”把它放出去，鱼儿听到同类的声音不待邀请，就会从各个方向聚集过来。如果把这个方法和“刻木求鱼”的方法配合起来，那在捕鱼的时候，自然会事半功倍了。
