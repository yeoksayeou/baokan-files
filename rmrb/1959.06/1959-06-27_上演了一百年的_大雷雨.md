A Hundred Years of "The Thunderstorm" on Stage

    "The Thunderstorm" is the immortal masterpiece of the Russian drama master Alexander Ostrovsky. From its first performance in 1859 to this year, it has been a hundred years.

    Because the author had a deep hatred and understanding of the patriarchal society in Russia at that time, he used superb artistic techniques to ruthlessly expose the true face of the sinful, dying feudal society at that time through the unfortunate experience of a persecuted woman, Katerina.

    After the May Fourth Movement, "The Thunderstorm" and the works of other great Russian writers such as Gogol, Chekhov, and Pushkin were introduced to China one after another. Since this play was first performed in China, it has been widely welcomed by audiences. Today, although the times are different, this performance by the Central Academy of Drama's Experimental Theatre is still beneficial in helping us understand the darkness and cruelty of the old society, as well as appreciate world-famous plays.

    上演了一百年的“大雷雨”
    “大雷雨”是俄罗斯戏剧大师奥斯特洛夫斯基的不朽剧作，这个戏从1859年第一次演出到今年，已经是一百年了。
    由于作者对当时俄国的宗法社会有着深刻的憎恨和理解，他运用了高超的艺术手法，通过一个受迫害的妇女卡特林娜的不幸遭遇，把当时罪恶的、垂死的封建社会的真实面貌，无情地揭露了出来。
    “五四”以后，“大雷雨”和果戈里、契呵夫、普希金等俄罗斯伟大作家的作品先后介绍到我国来。这个戏从第一次在我国演出以来，一直受到观众的普遍欢迎。今天，虽然时代不同了，但是，中央戏剧学院实验话剧院这一次的演出，对于帮助我们认识旧社会的黑暗和残酷，以及对世界名剧的欣赏，仍然是有益的。　（刘）
