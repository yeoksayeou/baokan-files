Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th. As the saying goes, "In the wheat harvest rainy season, bending over like a cat is better than running around three times in winter." In order to harvest the wheat with perfection, the People's Communes in Hebei Province are currently organizing commune members to repeatedly glean, repeatedly thresh, and repeatedly winnow, carrying out a "second wheat harvest."

At the beginning of this year's wheat harvest, the Party and government leading organs in Hebei Province instructed the People's Communes in various places to carry out a "five good" movement: harvesting well, preserving well, purchasing well, utilizing well, and planting well. During the wheat harvest, various regions mobilized semi-laborers, the elderly, and children to form wheat-gleaning teams, achieving simultaneous harvesting and gleaning, as well as repeated threshing and winnowing, making the wheat harvesting work more meticulous than in previous years. Now the wheat has been harvested, and the threshing work in Handan and Shijiazhuang Prefectures in the south has also been basically completed; however, the second wheat harvest is still in progress. About three million people across the province are involved in the second wheat harvest, with 1.84 million people in Handan and Shijiazhuang Prefectures alone.

After the wheat harvest was completed, many local People's Communes and Management Areas formed inspection teams to check the harvesting and threshing situation of the wheat with the production team cadres in the harvested wheat fields and threshing grounds. The inspection revealed that there were still instances of lost wheat ears and grains in the gleaned wheat fields and the finished threshing grounds. Therefore, through on-site meetings and detailed accounting, commune members were mobilized to actively participate in the second wheat harvest campaign. In Da Shangtun People's Commune in Renqiu County, the leading cadres picked up 9,500 wheat ears in a 6-mu (Chinese unit of measurement) wheat field in the Houzhongcun Production Team, equivalent to more than four *jin* (Chinese unit of measurement) of grain. Based on this fact, the commune held an on-site meeting, mobilizing more than 6,400 women, children, and elementary school students throughout the commune, who recovered more than 79,000 *jin* of wheat ears in just one day.

In areas where threshing has just ended, many communes have also inspected the edges of the threshing grounds and the threshed wheat stalks, and found that wheat grains were lost at the edges of the fields and wrapped in the wheat stalks. Commune members suggested: not only should we thresh cleanly, pick up cleanly, select cleanly, sweep cleanly, and sieve cleanly, but also before stacking the wheat stalks, we should shake the wheat stalks that have been rolled two or three times again. Commune members in the Dongguan Management Area of Dingzhou People's Commune in Ding County shook the wheat stalks from more than 1,900 *mu* of land once, recovering more than 1,600 *jin* of wheat.

According to the Shanxi Daily, "If the harvesting and threshing are not clean, the wheat harvest will not stop." Jinzhong District is launching a re-harvesting and re-threshing campaign to ensure that every ear of wheat enters the stage and every grain returns home.

The 8.3 million *mu* of wheat in the Jinzhong area has now been basically harvested, and the re-harvesting and re-threshing campaign has been launched again throughout the district. This year's re-harvesting and re-threshing campaign was launched after criticizing complacent and negative thoughts such as "This year's wheat is growing better than in any previous year, it doesn't matter if a few ears are lost." For example, in Pinglu County, out of 356,000 *mu* of wheat, all had been harvested and entered the threshing ground by June 20th, with over 70% threshed. In the process of harvesting and threshing, attention was generally paid to careful harvesting and careful threshing. In the harvesting process alone, the county organized more than 9,400 old men and children, recovering nearly one million *jin* of wheat ears, equivalent to 330,000 *jin* of wheat grains. However, after careful inspection, there were still many problems in terms of careful harvesting and careful threshing: first, the gleaning was not clean, especially in some remote and hilly areas; second, the threshing was not clean, most areas only threshed twice before stacking; third, the wheat chaff was not winnowed cleanly; and fourth, there was a lot of scattering at the edges of the fields. The Pinglu County Party Committee specifically calculated four accounts. If the ground could be gleaned cleanly, the wheat stalks threshed cleanly, the wheat chaff winnowed cleanly, and the edges of the fields swept cleanly, the county could harvest more than 3,560,000 *jin* of wheat, enough for 8,900 people to eat for a year. After inspection, Jishan, Yuncheng, Ruicheng, and other counties found that the loss of ears and grains was generally more than two *jin* per *mu*, and some lost three to five *jin*.

In order to quickly reverse the complacent mood in harvesting and threshing and ensure a bumper harvest, the Jinzhong District Party Committee once again instructed Party committee secretaries at all levels in the district to personally take charge of the re-harvesting and re-threshing, deeply go into the fields, and thoroughly carry out the re-harvesting and re-threshing, truly achieving the goal of not losing any ears and returning every grain home.

Currently, the number of people participating in wheat gleaning in the district has reached more than 300,000. Together with the first wheat gleaning, nearly ten million *jin* of wheat has been recovered. (Attached picture)

### 穗穗登场　粒粒还家  河北麦收工作精益求精  山西晋南开展复收复打运动拾麦一千万斤

    穗穗登场　粒粒还家
    河北麦收工作精益求精
    山西晋南开展复收复打运动拾麦一千万斤
    新华社天津26日电　俗语说，“麦秋雨季猫猫腰，胜过冬季走三遭”。河北省各地人民公社为了精益求精地收好麦子，目前都在组织社员反复拾、反复轧、反复扬，进行“第二次麦收”。
    今年麦收开始，河北省党政领导机关就指示各地人民公社开展收好、留好、征购好、用好、种好的“五好”运动。各地在麦收中，都发动半劳动力和老年、儿童等组成拾麦队，做到随收、随拾和复轧、复扬，麦收工作比往年做得细致。现在小麦已经收割完毕，南部邯郸、石家庄两个专区的打场工作也已经基本结束；但是二次麦收仍在进行。全省投入二次麦收的有三百万人左右，只邯郸、石家庄两个专区就有一百八十四万人。
    在小麦收割完毕后，许多地方的人民公社和管理区都组成了检查团，同生产队的干部一起到割过的麦田里和打麦场上，检查小麦的收打情况。检查中发现，已拾过的麦田里和打麦结束的麦场上，仍然有丢失麦穗、麦粒的现象。于是通过现场会和算细账，动员社员们积极地投入二次麦收运动。任丘县大尚屯人民公社的领导干部在后仲村生产队六分大的一片麦田里，拾到了九千五百个麦穗，折粮四斤多。通过这个事实，公社召开了现场会议，发动全社妇女、儿童、小学生六千四百多人，只一天功夫又拾回了七万九千多斤麦穗。
    在打场刚刚结束的地区，许多公社对场边和轧过的麦秸也进行了检查，发现场边丢有麦粒，麦秸里裹着麦粒。社员们提出：不只要打净、拾净、拣净、扫净、筛净，还要在麦秸上垛前，把轧过两三遍的麦秸再抖一次。定县定州人民公社东关管理区的社员把一千九百多亩地的麦秸抖了一次，就复收了小麦一千六百多斤。
    据山西日报消息　收打不净，麦收不停。晋南区开展复收复打运动，确保小麦穗穗登场，粒粒还家。
    晋南地区的八百三十万亩小麦，目前已基本收割完毕，复收复打运动又在全区展开。今年的复收复打运动，是批判了“今年的小麦长得比过去哪一年都好，丢上几穗不算啥”等自满、消极思想以后开展起来的。比如，平陆县的三十五万六千多亩小麦，到6月20日为止，已经收割完毕，全部登场，碾打了70％以上。在收割和碾打过程中，一般都注意了细收细打，只是在收割当中，全县就组织老汉、儿童九千四百余人，拾回麦穗近一百万斤，折合麦粒三十三万斤。但是经过认真检查，在细收细打方面仍然存在不少问题：一是拾得不净，特别是一些远地和山坡地；二是打得不净，大部分地区只碾打两遍，就打积结垛；三是麦糠扬的不净；四是场边抛撒多。中共平陆县委会具体算了四笔账，如果能够把地内拾净、麦秸碾净、麦糠扬净、场边扫净，全县就可多收小麦三百五十六万多斤，够八千九百多人吃一年。稷山、运城、芮城等县经过检查，每亩丢穗掉粒普遍在二斤以上，有的丢掉三至五斤。
    中共晋南地委为了迅速扭转收打中的自满情绪，确保丰产丰收，再次指示全区各级党委书记在复收复打中要亲自挂帅，重点深入田间，把复收复打深入开展起来，确实达到穗穗不丢，粒粒还家的目的。
    目前，全区参加拾麦的人数达三十余万，连同第一次拾麦，已经拾回小麦近一千万斤。（附图片）
