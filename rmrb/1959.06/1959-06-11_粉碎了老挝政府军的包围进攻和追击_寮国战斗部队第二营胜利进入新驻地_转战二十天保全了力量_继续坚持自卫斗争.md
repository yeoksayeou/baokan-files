Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th: Lao sources report: "Khuang Lao Patriotic News," the official newspaper of the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces, reported on June 5th that after twenty days of heroic fighting, the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces smashed the encirclement, attacks, and pursuit of the Lao Royal Government army, thereby victoriously withdrawing from its original garrison and preserving its strength.

According to reports, the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces has now withdrawn to treacherous mountainous areas and is continuing to heroically conduct self-defense struggles to resist the pursuit of the Phoui Sananikone government's army. Fierce fighting is taking place in the southeast region of Khuang.

"Khuang Lao Patriotic News" reported on the Phoui Sananikone government's attempt to eliminate the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces and the heroic self-defense battles fought by this battalion, saying:

On May 11th, under the instigation of the United States, the Phoui Sananikone government dispatched troops to encircle the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces, cut off its food supply, and demanded that the battalion disarm within twenty-four hours.

On May 13th, the Sananikone government arrested Tao Keuk, the commander of the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces.

Faced with the above-mentioned despicable and perfidious acts of the pro-American clique in Laos, the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces, in order to preserve its strength and stop their conspiracy, broke through the encirclement of the Phoui Sananikone government's army in the Tranninh Plain (i.e., the Plain of Jars) on May 18th and withdrew to other areas. The Phoui Sananikone government dispatched many mobile units, including paratroopers, to launch a pincer attack in an attempt to eliminate the Second Battalion.

On May 27th, a unit of the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces was besieged by two companies of the Royal Army in the Meng Fang area. This unit launched a heroic counterattack, smashed the siege, and drove the two companies of the Royal Army into headlong flight. On the same day, two companies of the Royal Army attacked a unit of the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces in the Ban Hang area. After a few minutes of fierce fighting, the Royal Army was defeated and fled into the mountains. The Second Battalion seized three guns and a batch of military supplies and ammunition.

In the past two days, fierce fighting has taken place in the southeast region of Khuang.

According to reports, after several fierce battles, the Lao Royal Army appeared exhausted and demoralized.

The newspaper said that the Second Battalion of the Laotian fighting forces encountered difficulties such as a shortage of medicines and food during its march and combat; however, their morale was high, and they received enthusiastic help from the people in many ways.

    新华社河内10日电　老挝消息：寮国战斗部队第二营机关报“川圹老挝爱国者消息报”6月5日报道，寮国战斗部队第二营在经过二十天的英勇战斗之后，粉碎了老挝王国政府军队的包围、进攻和追击，从而胜利地撤离了原驻地，并且保全了自己的力量。
    据报道，目前，寮国战斗部队第二营已经撤到险要的山岭地带，正在继续英勇地进行自卫斗争，抵抗培·萨纳尼空政府军队的追击。激烈的战斗正在川圹东南地区进行。
    “川圹老挝爱国者消息报”报道培·萨纳尼空政府企图消灭寮国战斗部队第二营和这个营进行英勇的自卫战斗的情况说：
    5月11日，培·萨纳尼空政府在美国的指使下，出动军队包围了寮国战斗部队第二营，截断它的粮食供应，并且要求这个营在二十四小时内缴械。
    5月13日，萨纳尼空政府逮捕了寮国战斗部队第二营营长陶格。
    面对老挝亲美集团上述卑鄙的背信行为，寮国战斗部队第二营为了保全自己的力量，制止他们的阴谋，在5月18日突破培·萨纳尼空政府军队在镇宁平原（即查尔平原）的包围圈，撤到别的地区。培·萨纳尼空政府出动了许多机动部队，其中包括伞兵部队，进行前后夹攻，企图消灭第二营。
    5月27日，寮国战斗部队第二营的一支部队在孟坊地区遭到王国军队两个连的围攻，这支部队进行了英勇的反击，粉碎了围攻，把王国军队的两个连打得抱头鼠窜。同一天，王国军队的两个连在班杭地区进攻寮国战斗部队第二营的一支部队，在经过几分钟的激烈战斗之后，王国军队败入山林中，第二营缴获三支枪枝以及一批军需品和弹药。
    最近两天来，在川圹东南地区，双方发生了激烈的战斗。
    据报道，经过几次激战后，老挝王国军队显得疲惫不堪，士气低落。
    这家报纸说，寮国战斗部队第二营在行军和战斗中，曾经遭遇缺乏药品和粮食等困难；但是，他们士气高涨，并且获得人民多方面的热情帮助。
