Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 13th: The Central Administration for Industry and Commerce recently convened a National Trademark Work On-Site Conference in Shanghai, introducing Shanghai's experience in comprehensively clearing trademarks and supervising product quality through trademark management. More than 100 representatives from all over the country and relevant central departments attended the meeting.

The representatives visited the "Trademark and Commodity Quality Exhibition" held by the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, listened to the Shanghai representatives' report on the comprehensive clearing of trademarks and the supervision of product quality through trademark management, as well as reports on trademark management work from eleven key provinces and cities, including Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Jiangsu, and Liaoning.

Not long ago, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and with the assistance of the Shanghai Working Group of the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, together with relevant departments, established a central group to unify leadership and cooperate closely, and comprehensively cleared the trademarks used in Shanghai. The results of the clearance showed that there were 6,250 trademarks in the city, of which 4,642 had been registered according to law, accounting for 74.27%; the rest were either in the process of registration, or a small number had not yet applied for registration. The Administration for Industry and Commerce has urged relevant units to go through registration procedures for unregistered trademarks according to law, and has promptly dealt with inappropriate words and graphics in some unregistered trademarks.

Supervising product quality through trademarks is a new task. Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the guidance of the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Textile Industry Bureau, Light Industry Bureau, Chemical Industry Bureau, and Electrical Machinery Bureau inspected the quality of some textile industrial products, light industrial products, chemical industrial products, and telecommunications equipment. The results of the inspection proved that Shanghai has created many new products with excellent quality in the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, which is the basic and main aspect. However, the quality of a few products is unstable or has declined. In addition to the impact of raw materials, the ideological emphasis on quantity over quality by some enterprise leaders, the presence of output targets but no quality targets, the relaxation of inspection systems, and failure to comply with process operating procedures are also important reasons for the decline in quality. After the inspection, all industrial departments mobilized the masses and took corresponding measures, and the downward trend in the quality of several products has been stopped. Shanghai's experience proves that supervising product quality through trademarks can help industrial departments improve their work, improve product quality, and strengthen the relationship between industrial and commercial departments.

    通过商标监督产品质量
    全国商标工作会议交流管理工作经验
    据新华社上海13日电　中央工商行政管理局最近在上海召开了全国商标工作现场会议，介绍了上海市全面清理商标和通过商标管理监督产品质量的经验。出席会议的，有全国各地和中央有关部门的代表一百多人。
    代表们参观了上海市工商局所举办的“商标与商品质量展览会”，听取了上海市代表关于商标全面清理和通过商标管理监督产品质量的报告，以及天津、广州、武汉、重庆、江苏、辽宁等十一个重点省、市的商标管理工作的汇报。
    上海市工商局不久以前，在中共上海市委的领导和中央工商行政管理局上海工作组的帮助下，会同各有关部门成立了一个中心组，统一领导，密切协作，对上海市使用的商标作了全面的清理。清理的结果是：全市共有商标六千二百五十个，其中已经依法注册的四千六百四十二个，占74.27％；其余有的正在办理注册手续，有少数尚未申请注册。工商局已督促有关单位对未注册的商标依法办理注册手续，并且对一些未注册商标的不恰当的文字、图形及时作了处理。
    通过商标监督产品质量，这是一项新的工作。上海市纺织工业局、轻工业局、化学工业局和电机局在市委统一领导和中央工商行政管理局的指导下，检查了一部分纺织工业品、轻工业品、化学工业品和电讯器材的质量。检查的结果证明，上海市在全面大跃进中，创制了许多质量优良的新产品，这是基本的、主要的方面。但是，也有少数产品的质量不稳定或者下降。除了原料材料方面的影响以外，一些企业领导思想上重量而不重质，有产量指标而无质量指标，放松检验制度，不遵守工艺操作规程等等，也是影响质量下降的重要原因。经过检查以后，各工业部门都发动群众，采取了相应的措施，若干产品质量下降的趋势已经停止。上海市的经验证明，通过商标监督产品质量，可以帮助工业部门改进工作，提高产品质量，并且密切工业部门和商业部门之间的关系。
