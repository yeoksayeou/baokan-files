Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 24th. Xingguo various communes in Jiangxi Province, after signing commodity production and sales contracts with commercial departments, are actively developing production according to the national plan and conscientiously implementing the contracts.

The twenty people's communes in Xingguo County signed 240 production and sales contracts with the commercial departments in March, stipulating 96 major commodities, with a total value of 5.96 million yuan, mainly including local specialties, animal products, Chinese medicinal materials, and handicrafts. Because the communes conscientiously organized production in accordance with the contract provisions, some contracts have now been fulfilled. According to the contract, Changgang Commune should sell 100 live pigs to the commercial department in the recent month. As a result, 158 heads were sold. Jun Village Commune should deliver 10 dan of bamboo shoots in the second quarter according to the contract, and now more than 100 dan have been delivered. Dinglong Commune has also delivered the live pigs and poultry that should be delivered in the second quarter according to the contract.

In order to ensure the realization of production and sales contracts, the Party organizations of the communes and production teams have strengthened their leadership, designated a secretary to specifically grasp this work, and regularly held meetings to study and solve the problems in implementation. Dinglong Commune in the mountainous area has wild fodder everywhere, which was not utilized in the past. After the commune signed a production and sales contract for live pigs and poultry with the commercial department this year, the commune Party committee organized commune members to collect wild fodder and raise livestock and poultry. In less than a month, the commune increased its stock by more than 1,000 live pigs and more than 30,000 poultry. The communes also organized inspection teams to patrol the production teams to check the implementation of the contracts and to supervise and help.

In the implementation of the contracts, the communes and production teams have received the support of the commercial departments. During the summer harvest and summer planting, the commercial departments promptly supplied the production materials such as seeds, fertilizers, tools, and pesticides needed by the communes. Fengbian Commune lacked breeding livestock, chickens and ducks. The commercial department immediately purchased more than 1,000 chickens and ducks and more than 100 breeding livestock from other places and supplied them to the commune, and sent technicians to guide the commune members to build hatcheries and livestock pens.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 24th. The people's communes in Guiding County, Guizhou Province, conscientiously implement production and sales contracts, which has enabled a diversified economy to develop rapidly.

At present, the county has raised 53,250 live pigs, an average of more than one per household; 190,000 chickens, an increase of nearly 100,000 from the beginning of January. Historically, Guiding County did not produce any silk, but this year there has been a relatively large amount of production. Vegetables have also begun to supply Guiyang and Duyun.

Guiding County is rich in grain and flue-cured tobacco. In the past, the farmers here, in addition to growing flue-cured tobacco, grew grain. Few people operated other cash crops, poultry, livestock, vegetables, aquatic products, and local specialties, so some non-staple foods had to be transferred in from other places every year. In order to promote the development of a diversified economy in the communes, the commercial department of Guiding County assisted the communes in formulating a diversified management plan at the beginning of this year, and then signed contracts for the production and sales of sideline products with the communes. The non-staple foods included in the contracts alone included 19 kinds such as live pigs, beef cattle, and vegetables, with a total value of 5.12 million yuan.

After signing the contract, the communes at all levels implemented the tasks to the management areas and production teams, and extracted some commune members to organize specialized production teams to engage in production. Now, the county has established four vegetable production bases and more than 100 pig farms, chicken farms, fish ponds, and rabbit farms. Many production teams that used to produce only tobacco and grain have seen a prosperous scene of thriving in all five industries.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 24th. The commercial department of Hechi County, Guangxi, has a long-term plan and short-term arrangements. On the basis of signing an annual production and sales contract for sideline products with the people's communes, it has also signed production and sales contracts with the communes on a monthly and quarterly basis according to the changes in the production season.

These contracts have made the tasks more specific. After they are implemented to the grassroots production units, they have further increased the enthusiasm of the commune members to carry out sideline production. From April to mid-June, the total value of sideline products purchased by the county's commercial departments from the communes according to the contracts reached 394,000 yuan, an increase of 55.7% over the actual purchase in the same period last year. Among them, the purchase volume of major commodities such as live pigs, beef cattle, cube sugar, cowhide, wood, and wild hemp increased by 20% to 90% respectively compared with the first quarter.

At the beginning of this year, the commercial department of Hechi County signed annual production and sales contracts with the communes. Because the time specified in the contract was too long, the communes were prone to losing sight of one thing while attending to another or missing the production season when arranging production. After discovering this problem, the commercial department, from the second quarter, further signed short-term contracts with the production units on a quarterly and monthly basis according to the overall provisions of the annual contract and the production season of rural sideline products, and specifically arranged the production and sales plans for various products. The steps for signing short-term contracts are: first, the commune supply and marketing cooperative signs with the brigades, and the brigades assign the tasks to the production teams; then, the commune supply and marketing cooperative signs with the county commercial bureau, so that each link is tightly linked and implemented at all levels.

    执行产销合同  促进多种经营
    兴国各公社如期出售生猪
    据新华社南昌24日电　江西兴国县各人民公社和商业部门签订商品产销合同之后，正在按照国家计划积极地发展生产，认真地执行合同。
    兴国县二十个人民公社在3月间和商业部门分别签订了二百四十份产销合同，订入合同的主要商品有九十六种，总金额共五百九十六万元，主要是土特产品、畜产品、中药材和手工业品等。由于各公社认真地按照合同规定组织生产，现在有的合同已经实现。长冈公社按照合同规定，在最近一个月应向商业部门出售生猪一百头，执行结果出售了一百五十八头。均村公社按合同第二季度要交售笋壳十担，现在就已交售一百多担。丁龙公社按合同第二季度应该交售的生猪家禽，也已如数交售。
    为了确保实现产销合同，各公社、生产队的党组织都加强了领导，指定一名书记专门抓这项工作，定期开会研究解决执行中的问题。山区的丁龙公社到处有野生饲料，过去没有利用。公社今年同商业部门签订了生猪、家禽产销合同以后，公社党委便组织社员采集野生饲料，饲养家畜家禽，不到一个月全社就增加了一千多头生猪和三万多只家禽。各公社还组织检查组，巡回到各生产队检查合同的执行情况，加以督促和帮助。
    各公社、生产队在执行合同中，得到了商业部门的支援。在夏收夏种期间，公社需要的种籽、肥料、工具、农药等生产资料，商业部门都及时供应。枫边公社缺少种畜和种鸡、种鸭，商业部门立即从外地采购了一千多只鸡鸭和一百多头种畜，供给这个公社，并且派技术人员指导社员们修建孵房、畜栏。
    贵定副业生产欣欣向荣
    据新华社贵阳24日电　贵州省贵定县各人民公社认真执行产销合同，使多种经济很快地发展起来。
    目前，全县已养生猪五万三千二百五十头，平均每户有一头多；养鸡十九万只，比1月初增加近十万只。历史上贵定县不产半点蚕丝，而今年有了比较大量的生产。蔬菜也开始供应贵阳、都匀两市。
    贵定县盛产粮食和烤烟。过去，这里的农民除了种烤烟，就是种粮食，其他经济作物、家禽家畜、蔬菜水产以及土特产品等，很少有人经营，因此每年都要从外地调进一些副食品。贵定县商业部门为了促进各公社发展多种经济，在今年年初协助各公社制订了多种经营的规划，然后与公社签订了副业产品产销合同，单是订入合同的副食品，就有生猪、菜牛、蔬菜等十九种，总值五百一十二万元。
    各人民公社在签订合同以后，逐级把任务落实到管理区和生产队，并且抽出部分社员组织专业生产队从事生产。现在全县已建立四个蔬菜生产基地和一百多处养猪场、养鸡场、养鱼塘、养兔场。许多过去单一生产烟、粮的生产队，出现了五业俱兴的繁荣景象。
    河池收购量比去年同期增加55％
    新华社南宁24日电　广西河池县商业部门长计划、短安排，在与人民公社签订全年度副业产品产销合同的基础上，又根据生产季节的变化，分月、分季与公社签订产销合同。
    这些合同把任务规定得更加具体，落实到基层生产单位以后，更加提高了社员们开展副业生产的积极性。从4月到6月中旬，全县商业部门按合同向各公社收购的副业产品总值达三十九万四千元，比去年同期的收购实绩增加55.7％，其中生猪、菜牛、方糖、牛皮、木柴野麻等主要商品的收购量，分别比第一季度的收购量增加20％到90％。
    河池县商业部门今年年初与各公社签订了年度产销合同。由于合同规定的时间过长，公社安排生产时容易顾此失彼或者错过生产季节。商业部门发现这个问题以后，从第二季度起，按照年度合同的总的规定，进一步根据农村副业产品的生产季节，分季、分月与生产单位签订短期合同，具体安排各种产品的产销计划。签订短期合同的步骤是，首先由公社供销部与各大队签订，大队把任务分配到生产队；然后，公社供销部再与县商业局签订，做到环环扣紧，层层落实。
