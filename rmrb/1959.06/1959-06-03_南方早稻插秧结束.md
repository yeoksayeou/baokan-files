Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: The transplanting of early rice in southern provinces has basically concluded, and field management work to strive for a bumper early rice harvest has been widely launched. In Guangdong and Guangxi, the early-transplanted early rice has begun to head and flower, entering a period of intense late-stage management.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture in late May, over 120 million mu of early rice were planted in southern provinces this year. The transplanting period was generally five to ten days earlier than in previous years. The planting density has also increased appropriately, with approximately 20,000 to 40,000 holes planted per mu in various locations, with fewer areas planting below 20,000 holes or above 40,000 holes. The seedbeds were generally plowed deeper, and most paddy fields received more base fertilizer than in previous years. These conditions have laid a good foundation for striving for a bumper early rice harvest this year.

Currently, the early rice-producing areas in the south are a sea of green, and the seedlings are mostly growing vigorously. According to inspections conducted in mid-May in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other provinces and regions, first and second-class seedlings generally account for 70% to 85%. Except for some early rice in the Lingnan area that has already headed, and some early rice on Hainan Island that has already begun to be harvested, the early rice in the provinces of the Yangtze River Basin has mostly entered the peak tillering stage or jointing stage, which is the tense season for early rice field management. To strive for a bumper early rice harvest this year, many areas such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang have conducted large-scale field inspections and comparisons. Hubei Province launched a high tide of early rice field management through large-scale inspections and comparisons. After transplanting, in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, thousands upon thousands of rural cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians worked together, using on-site consultations and prescribing the right remedy to mobilize the masses to continuously rank the seedlings, continuously eliminate third-class seedlings, and rapidly launch a high tide of weeding and topdressing. In Guangdong Province, rural cadres are combined with farmers and technicians to jointly discuss, formulate, and be responsible for the implementation of field management measures. Now, early rice throughout the province has been cultivated and topdressed. Jiangxi Province has also mobilized its main cadres to strengthen leadership over summer production and proposed that first-class seedlings ride the wind and waves, second-class seedlings catch up from behind, and resolutely eliminate third-class seedlings. Now, most of the early rice throughout the province has undergone the second plowing and topdressing. Hunan Province launched a seedling upgrade movement, and early rice throughout the province has generally undergone the first plowing and topdressing.

Due to insufficient base fertilizer in a few early rice fields, all regions attach great importance to topdressing in strengthening early rice management, and vigorously carry out a shock campaign to accumulate fertilizer, create fertilizer, and topdress. During the early rice field management period, all regions also paid close attention to preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests and preventing lodging. Recently, rice blast and other diseases and insect pests have been found in some early rice in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and other provinces and regions, and local farmers are actively preventing and controlling them. Guangdong Province is also using methods such as draining water and drying fields, and spreading ashes to prevent lodging of first-class seedlings.

    南方早稻插秧结束
    据新华社2日讯　南方各省早稻插秧已经基本结束，争取早稻丰收的田间管理工作已经普遍展开。广东、广西早插的早稻已经开始吐穗扬花，进入紧张的后期管理时期。
    据农业部5月下旬的统计，今年南方各省共插种早稻一亿二千多万亩。插秧期一般比往年提早五到十天。插秧密度也有适当的增加，各地每亩约插秧二万到四万穴，两万穴以下和四万穴以上的较少。秧田一般耕得较深，大部分稻田底肥比往年都有增加。这些条件，为今年争取早稻丰收打下了良好的基础。
    目前，南方各早稻产区，稻田一片碧绿，禾苗大都生长茁壮。据广东、广西、湖南、江西、福建等省、区
  5月中旬检查，一、二类苗一般在70％到85％之间。除岭南地区部分早稻已经抽穗，海南岛部分早稻已开始收割外，长江流域各省早稻已大部进入了分蘖盛期或拔节期，正是早稻田间管理的紧张季节。为争取今年早稻大丰收，广东、广西、湖北、江西、浙江等许多地区，都进行了田间大检查、大评比。湖北省通过大检查、大评比掀起了早稻田间管理的高潮。广西僮族自治区在插秧结束后，千千万万的农村干部和老农、技术员在一起，用田头会诊，对症下药的办法发动群众不断进行禾苗排队，不断消灭三类苗，迅速地掀起了耘田追肥高潮。广东省的农村干部和农民、技术员相结合，共同讨论、制定和负责执行田间管理的措施，现在全省早稻已经中耕、追肥。江西省也调动了主要干部加强了对夏季生产的领导，并提出要一类苗乘风破浪，二类苗迎头赶上，坚决消灭三类苗，现在全省大部分早稻都进行了第二遍中耕和追肥。湖南省开展了禾苗升级运动，全省早稻普遍经过头遍中耕和追肥。
    由于少数早稻田底肥不足，各地在加强早稻管理中都很重视追肥，大搞突击积肥、造肥、追肥运动。各地在早稻田间管理期间还密切注意了防治病虫害和防止倒伏的工作。最近，广东、广西、福建等省、区有部分早稻发现了稻热病等病虫害，当地农民正在积极防治。广东省各地还用排水晒田、撒草木灰等办法，防止一类苗倒伏。
