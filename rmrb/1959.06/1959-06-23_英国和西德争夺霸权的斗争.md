    The Struggle for Hegemony Between Britain and West Germany
    Ou Ying
    In recent years, due to the increasing imbalance of capitalist development and the impact of the economic crisis on the capitalist world, contradictions between imperialist countries have become increasingly profound. Last year, the fierce dispute between Britain, West Germany, and France over the Common Market and the Free Trade Area finally created openly opposed economic blocs in Western Europe. With the development of the situation, this profound economic contradiction has gradually erupted into a comprehensive economic, political, and military struggle. Since the beginning of this year, the deep strategic differences between Britain and the United States, France, and West Germany, especially between Britain and West Germany, on West Berlin and the German question are manifestations of this intensified contradiction.
    I
    The increasingly sharp contradiction between Britain and West Germany is not accidental. In recent years, the economic and military strength of the West German monopoly bourgeoisie has greatly increased. Its economic power has surpassed that of Britain, and its military strength, due to strong American support, has made Britain feel uneasy. The balance of power between the two countries has undergone major changes.
    In 1958, West Germany's total industrial output and manufactured goods exports both surpassed Britain, ranking second in the capitalist world, second only to the United States.
    The following is a comparison of several major industrial outputs in 1958:
            Steel　Automobiles　Shipbuilding
    West Germany　22.8 million tons　1.5 million vehicles　1.46 million tons
    Britain　19.6 million tons　1.4 million vehicles　1.4 million tons
    In the smelting of non-ferrous metals, West Germany's production of copper, lead, aluminum, and zinc has all exceeded that of Britain. In addition, the output of chemicals, tractors, cement, and man-made fibers has also gradually caught up with and surpassed Britain in the past few years.
    The ebb and flow of economic strength has also changed the competitive positions of the two countries in foreign markets. According to 1958 statistics, West Germany's share of total manufactured goods exports in the capitalist world increased from 17.5% in 1957 to 18.6%, while Britain's share decreased from 18.1% to 18% during the same period. In the field of chemicals, West Germany had already surpassed Britain in 1956, and West Germany's machine tool exports had already won the first place in the capitalist market in 1954. In the markets of Western and Northern European countries, West Germany, due to its traditional ties and geographical conditions, successively defeated the competition from Britain, the United States, and France in the first few years after the war and jumped to first place. In Latin America, West Germany has been the second largest exporter after the United States since 1953, pushing Britain to third place. In the sterling area market, Britain still holds the advantage in import and export volume in terms of trade volume, but West Germany's export growth rate to overseas sterling area is much faster than Britain's. In 1957, West Germany's exports to overseas sterling area countries increased by 19% compared with 1956, and by 23% compared with 1955, while Britain's exports maintained the 1956 level in the same year, only increasing by 2% compared with 1955. In the currency war in Western European countries, the pound is also at a disadvantage. As a result of years of trade surplus, West Germany currently has more than six billion US dollars in gold and dollar reserves, which is equivalent to twice the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area.
    Among the six countries of the West European Common Market, West Germany's economic strength is overwhelmingly dominant. West Germany's industrial production is almost equal to the total production of the other five countries. For example, West Germany accounts for 60% of coal, 46.5% of steel, 42% of cement, and 51% of automobiles. The establishment of the West European Common Market will enable West German monopoly capital to further squeeze out British influence and dominate the European continent.
    II
    In military terms, West Germany's strength has grown significantly since it officially began building its army in 1955. Although it is not as powerful as Britain at present, it has already caused uneasiness among the British ruling class.
    Since the Paris Agreements on the rearmament of West Germany were passed by Britain, France, and other countries in 1954, West Germany's military strength has quickly revived. At present, West Germany has an army of 185,000 men, 800 to 1,000 fighter jets and fighter-bombers, a navy of 18,000 men, and 101 ships of various types. According to the military construction plan, West Germany will have 350,000 regular troops in 1961, which is roughly equivalent to the force that Britain expects to have in 1962.
    In terms of military equipment, West Germany is currently actively strengthening its atomic armament with the support of the United States. In 1958, the United States had supplied West Germany with 24 "Honest John" rockets equipped with nuclear warheads and two rocket launchers. This year, the United States supplied another 24 "Matador" missiles and six launchers. The West German troops operating these atomic weapons are all trained by the United States. In April of this year, West German Defense Minister Strauss visited the United States and obtained many modern weapons such as missiles from the United States.
    West Germany's arms industry is also currently making great preparations for manufacturing weapons, and the West German Ministry of Defense has already placed a large number of military orders with West German industrial departments. In addition to general weapons, West Germany is currently demanding a relaxation of the restrictions of the Paris Agreements and is already self-manufacturing SSIO and SSII anti-tank missiles. Of particular note is that, despite Britain's efforts to keep West Germany and France out of the "atomic club" and allow it to continue to occupy the position of an atomic power, West Germany, with the tacit approval of the United States, is colluding with France and Italy to vigorously test various atomic weapons.
    Although West Germany has not yet reached a very powerful position militarily today, it is already impatiently demanding military hegemony in the North Atlantic Group. West German militarists have already occupied high positions such as commander of the Central European ground forces and chief of staff in this aggressive group, but they are not satisfied. They are demanding that the Nordic Command also be controlled by West German generals. They have also decided to establish military warehouses in Denmark, Norway, France, and Belgium.
    From the above situation, it can be seen how serious the threat of West Germany's rise is to Britain. And how to deal with this increasingly serious threat has become one of the most important issues that the British ruling group is painstakingly anxious about.
    III
    The German monopoly capital group has always been Britain's mortal enemy, and the irreconcilable contradiction between the monopoly capital groups of the two countries was an important factor that triggered the two world wars. At present, the Anglo-German contradiction is so sharp again that the evolution of Britain's policy and approach towards West Germany is having an increasingly obvious and important impact on Britain's entire foreign policy.
    Britain's basic policy towards West Germany is to both utilize and control, to both support and guard against. To support and utilize West Germany as a tool for anti-Soviet and anti-communist cold war and preparation for hot war. However, due to the lessons of the two world wars and the feeling that the rise of West German power threatens its own interests, Britain is increasingly uneasy about the revival of West German militarism. In 1954, the British ruling class took the lead in passing the Paris Agreements, also to make West Germany armed only under certain restrictions. Now, West Germany's economic and military strength has grown rapidly, and the balance of power between Britain and West Germany is undergoing increasingly unfavorable changes for Britain. At the same time, there is now a political situation in which France and West Germany are colluding to jointly squeeze out Britain. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, Britain's policy towards West Germany has been to take advantage of the current opportunity, especially on the issues of West Berlin and Germany, to exert pressure on West Germany in its unfavorable position under public opinion pressure, in an attempt to force West Germany to make concessions. At the same time, in order to make up for the trade losses caused by the establishment of the Common Market and to cope with public opinion pressure, Britain's diplomatic strategy is somewhat different from West Germany's rigid attitude. It advocates negotiations with the Soviet Union; advocates a firm but flexible attitude towards the Soviet Union; advocates the implementation of arms and troop restrictions in Central Europe, and that the legal status of West Berlin can be considered to be redefined, and so on. All of this is obviously intended to limit West Germany's power. However, this tactic of Britain and the proposals it has put forward have not been supported by Western allies and have aroused the firm opposition of the United States, West Germany, and France. Precisely because Britain has adopted a two-pronged policy of both utilizing and restricting West Germany, there is also a side of compromise. Especially when the United States, West Germany, and France rise up together to resist Britain, Britain has to retreat step by step. For example, later its proposal to implement arms restrictions in Central Europe became a provision for the maximum limit of troops; it also agreed to the so-called "package plan" of the United States and West Germany. At the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, Britain still insisted on the occupation system of West Berlin, showing that it basically followed the United States and West Germany. However, due to the profoundness of the contradiction between Britain and West Germany in economic interests, in some aspects, Britain has not abandoned its original plan. On the issue of the summit meeting, Britain is still relatively active. West Germany has tried its best to oppose breaking up the "package plan", but Britain has expressed its willingness to discuss the West Berlin issue and the German unification issue and the peace treaty with Germany separately. In addition, Reuters and the Confederation of British Industry have also decided to establish branches in the German Democratic Republic. All of this is obviously unfavorable to Adenauer. Because any easing in the above-mentioned situation would be a blow to Adenauer's policy of strength.
    At present, the main target of the struggle for hegemony in West Germany is aimed at Britain. Economically, West Germany is squeezing out British influence in various markets in the capitalist world. In the North Atlantic Group, West Germany is also competing with Britain for the second seat. West Germany clearly has three favorable conditions in this struggle. The first is that West Germany's economic power is stronger than Britain's; the second is the United States' support and support for West Germany; and the third is that in recent years, West Germany has linked several major countries on the European continent into an anti-British front headed by West Germany through the Common Market, the "Coal and Steel Community" and other "European unification" activities. At the same time, West Germany has also used attracting other countries dissatisfied with Britain to isolate and attack Britain. All of this makes West Germany's position in Western Europe more advantageous than Britain's. Adenauer once publicly said: Now the leader on the European continent is no longer Britain, but West Germany. On the current issue of West Berlin and German unification, Adenauer's rigid cold war attitude has been strongly opposed by domestic and foreign public opinion, which puts West Germany in a disadvantageous position in the struggle for hegemony with Britain. But West Germany has never been willing to give up. On the one hand, it uses the axis formed with France, and on the other hand, it strives for the support of the United States to confront Britain's "firm" and "flexible" policies. Especially when Britain retreated step by step under the opposition of "allied countries," West Germany took the opportunity to counterattack Britain and forced Britain to abandon its主張. At present, in order to prevent the relaxation of the international situation and disrupt the discussion of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the United States is doing its best to use West Germany to exert pressure on Britain, and even launched an "anti-British" movement to prevent Britain's "flexible" policy from moving, so that the West formed a solid united front to hinder the smooth discussion of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Not long ago, West German Adenauer's about-face decision to insist on staying in the position of Prime Minister, from the perspective of the internal relations of Western allies, was precisely a move by Adenauer to resist Macmillan's influence with the support of the United States.
    At present, the struggle between Britain and West Germany has not ended. With the intensification of economic, political, and military difficulties of imperialist countries, the contradictions between the two countries will further deepen.

    英国和西德争夺霸权的斗争
    鸥英
    近年来，由于资本主义发展不平衡的加剧，资本主义世界普遍受到经济危机冲击的影响，帝国主义国家间的矛盾越来越深刻。去年英国和西德、法国之间在共同市场及自由贸易区问题上的激烈争吵终于在西欧造成了公开对立的经济集团。随着形势的发展，这种深刻的经济矛盾更逐渐爆发为全面的经济、政治、军事的斗争。今年以来，英国同美、法、西德之间特别是英国同西德之间在西柏林和德国问题上的深刻的策略分歧就是这种矛盾尖锐化的表现。
    一
    英国西德之间的矛盾愈来愈尖锐，这并不是偶然的。近年来西德垄断资产阶级的经济力量和军事力量都有了很大的增长。经济力量已经超过英国，军事上由于美国的大力扶植已使英国感到不安。两国的实力对比发生了重大的变化。
    1958年西德的工业总产量和制成品出口额都已超过英国，跃居资本主义世界第二位，仅次于美国。
    下面是1958年几项主要工业产量的比较：
            钢　汽车　造船
    西德　2，280万吨　150万辆　146万吨
    英国　1，960万吨　140万辆　140万吨
    在非铁金属的冶炼方面，西德的铜、铅、铝、锌的产量都已超过英国。此外，在化学品、拖拉机、水泥、人造纤维等方面的产量也在过去几年里陆续赶上和超过了英国。
    经济实力的消长也改变了两国在国外市场上的竞争地位。根据1958年的统计，西德在资本主义世界制成品出口总额中所占比重由1957年的17.5％上升为18.6％，而在同期内英国的比重由18.1％下降为18％。在化学品方面，西德在1956年即已超过英国，西德的机床出口在1954年就已夺得资本主义市场的第一位。在西欧及北欧各国市场上西德由于有传统联系和地理上的条件，在战后最初几年里即先后击败英、美、法等国的竞争而跃居第一位。在拉丁美洲，西德从1953年起就成为仅次于美国的第二个输出国，把英国排挤到第三位。在英镑区市场上，以贸易量来说英国仍占进出口的优势，但是，西德对海外英镑区出口增长速度比英国要快得多，1957年西德对海外英镑区各国的出口比1956年增长19％，比1955年增长23％，而同年内英国出口只维持了1956年的水平，比1955年只增加了2％。而在西欧各国的货币战中，英镑也处于劣势地位。由于连年出超的结果，目前西德拥有的黄金美元储备超过六十亿美元，相当于英镑区黄金美元储备的两倍。
    在西欧共同市场六国中，西德的经济实力占压倒优势，西德一国的工业生产几乎等于其他五国的生产总和。例如西德的煤占60％，钢占46.5％，水泥占42％，汽车占51％。西欧共同市场的成立将使西德垄断资本进一步排挤英国的势力，在西欧大陆上称霸。
    二
    在军事上，自1955年正式开始建军以来，西德的力量已有很大的增长。虽然目前还不如英国强大，但已经引起英国统治阶级的不安。
    自1954年英法等国通过了重新武装西德的巴黎协定后，西德的军事力量就很快复活起来。目前西德拥有军队十八万五千人，有歼击机及歼击轰炸机八百到一千架，海军一万八千人，有各种舰艇一百零一艘。另据建军计划，西德在1961年将有正规部队三十五万人，这就大体相当于英国预计在1962年所拥有的兵力。
    在军事装备方面，西德目前正在美国的扶植下，积极加强原子武装。1958年美国已供应西德二十四个装有核弹头的“诚实的约翰”式火箭和两个火箭发射台，今年美国又供应二十四个“斗牛士”式导弹和六个发射台。操纵这些原子武器的西德军队，都是由美国训练的。今年4月西德国防部长施特劳斯赴美活动，又从美国得到了许多导弹等现代化武器。
    西德的军火工业目前也正在大力准备制造武器，西德国防部已经向西德工业部门订购了大批的军事订货。除了一般性武器外，西德目前要求放宽巴黎协定的限制，并已在自造SSIO和SSII反坦克导弹，特别值得注意的是，尽管英国竭力想使西德和法国关在“原子俱乐部”的门外，让它继续居于原子大国的地位，但是西德却在美国的默许之下，勾结法国和意大利大力试制各种原子武器。
    虽然今天西德还没有在军事上达到十分强有力的地位，但是它却已迫不及待地要求在北大西洋集团中的军事霸权了。西德军国主义分子已经在这个侵略集团中占据了中欧地面部队司令、参谋长等高职，然而他们还不满足。他们正在要求把北欧司令部也归西德的将军控制。他们并且决定在丹麦、挪威、法国、比利时建立起军事仓库。
    从以上情况可以看出西德的崛起对英国的威胁是多么严重。而如何对付这一日益严重的威胁已经成为英国统治集团苦心焦虑的最主要问题之一了。
    三
    德国垄断资本集团一直是英国的死对头，两国垄断资本集团的不可调和的矛盾曾经是触发两次世界大战的重要因素。目前英德矛盾又已如此尖锐，英国对西德的政策和作法的演变，对英国整个对外政策正在产生日益明显的有重要意义的影响。
    英国对西德的基本政策是既要利用又要控制，既要扶植又要防范。扶植和利用西德作为反苏反共进行冷战和准备热战的工具。但是由于两次世界大战的教训，以及感到西德势力的崛起对它自身利益的威胁，因此，英国对西德军国主义的复活日益感到不安。1954年英国统治阶级带头通过巴黎协定，也是为了使西德只在一定的限制之下武装起来。现在，西德的经济和军事实力有了急剧的增长，英国和西德的实力对比正在起着愈来愈对英国不利的变化，同时目前又出现了法国和西德勾结，共同排挤英国的政治形势。因此，今年以来英国对西德的政策是利用目前时机，特别是在西柏林和德国问题上，美国和西德在舆论压力下，所处的不利地位向西德施加压力，企图迫使西德作让步。同时为了弥补由于成立共同市场而遭到的贸易上的损失和应付舆论压力，英国在外交策略上和西德的僵硬态度有所不同。它主张和苏联谈判；主张对苏联采取坚定而又灵活的态度；主张在中欧地区实行军备和军队的限制，以及可以考虑重新制定关于西柏林的法律地位等等。这一切显然是想限制西德的力量。但是，英国的这一手法和它所提出的这些主张没有得到西方盟国的支持，引起了美国、西德和法国的坚决反对。正由于英国对西德采取既利用又限制的两面政策，因此也就有妥协的一面。特别当美国、西德、法国一起起来抵制英国时，英国也就不得不步步后退。例如后来它的在中欧实行军备限制的主张变成了规定军队的最高限额；它又同意了美国和西德的所谓“一揽子计划”。在日内瓦外长会议上，英国仍然坚持对西柏林的占领制度，表现出基本上跟美国和西德走。但是由于英国和西德在经济利益上矛盾的深刻性，因此在某些方面，英国还没有放弃它的原来的打算。在最高级会议问题上，英国仍然比较积极。西德竭力反对把“一揽子计划”拆开来，但是英国却表示愿意把西柏林问题和德国统一问题和对德和约等问题分开来谈。此外，英国的路透社和工业联合会也决定在德意志民主共和国成立分支机构。这一切显然是对阿登纳不利的。因为任何在上述局势方面有一点缓和的话，都是对阿登纳的实力政策的一个打击。
    在目前，西德争夺霸权的斗争中，主要的矛头是针对着英国。在经济上，西德正在资本主义世界各个市场上节节排挤英国的势力。在北大西洋集团中，西德又在和英国争夺第二把交椅。西德在这场斗争中，显然有着三个有利的条件。首先是西德的经济力量比英国强；其次是美国对西德的扶植和支持；第三，近年来西德通过共同市场“煤钢联营”等“欧洲统一”活动把西欧大陆上几个主要国家联结成一个以西德为首的反英阵线。同时西德又利用拉拢其他对英国不满的国家来孤立和打击英国。这一切就使得西德在西欧的地位比英国占优势。阿登纳曾经公开说过：现在欧洲大陆上的领导者已经不是英国，而是西德了。在当前西柏林和德国统一问题上，由于阿登纳的僵硬的冷战态度遭到国内外舆论的强烈的反对，这使西德在和英国争夺霸权的斗争中处于不利的地位。但是西德始终不肯罢休，它一面利用同法国结成的轴心，一面又争取美国的支持来对抗英国的“坚定”而“灵活”的政策。特别当英国在“盟国”反对下而步步后退时，西德更乘机向英国反攻，压迫英国放弃它的主张。而目前，美国为了阻挡国际局势的缓和，破坏日内瓦外长会议的讨论，它就竭力利用西德来向英国施加压力，甚至掀起一个“反英”运动来使英国“灵活”的政策不得动弹，从而使西方结成一个阻碍外长会议顺利讨论的巩固的统一阵线。不久前，西德阿登纳出尔反尔坚持赖在总理职位上的决定，从西方盟国内部的关系来看，也正是阿登纳企图在美国支持之下，抵制麦克米伦影响的一个做法。
    目前，英国和西德的斗争还没有结束。随着帝国主义国家在经济、政治、军事上困难的加剧，这两个国家的矛盾也将会进一步加深。
