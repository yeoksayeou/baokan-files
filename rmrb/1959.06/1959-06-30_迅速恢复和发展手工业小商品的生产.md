    Rapidly Restore and Develop the Production of Handicraft Small Commodities
    Recently, various regions have been vigorously grasping the production of daily-use industrial products, and many daily necessities are growing at a very fast rate.
    In 1958 and the first half of this year, the growth rate of daily-use industrial products was very large. For example, from January to May this year, Shanghai's light industry production (excluding the textile industry) increased by 34% compared with the same period last year, while the retail sales of daily-use industrial products increased by 41% in the same period. This means that production is developing very fast, but purchasing power is growing even faster.
    In the supply of daily-use industrial products, a relatively prominent problem is the insufficient supply of some small commodities. Most of these small commodities are produced by handicrafts. In 1958, China's handicrafts developed greatly. In that year, the total output value of handicrafts nationwide (including those in transitional conversion) increased by nearly 50% compared with 1957. This rate of development is unprecedented, indicating that the achievements made by handicrafts in the first year of the Great Leap Forward were also very significant. However, we should also see that the growth of various types of handicrafts is unbalanced. Handicrafts serving modern industry have grown more and faster, while handicrafts serving agriculture and people's lives have grown less and slower. During the Great Leap Forward last year, some handicrafts originally producing daily necessities were transferred to serve industrial construction, and another part was transferred to produce other products. In the repair and service industries, some were converted to manufacturing, thus squeezing out a part of the production of daily-use small commodities and repair service businesses, resulting in a shortage of some small commodities and inconvenience in people's lives. Therefore, while vigorously grasping the increase in production of daily-use industrial products, in addition to those modern light industries that should strive to increase production of daily necessities, we must also attach importance to rapidly restoring and developing the production of handicraft small commodities. This is an important link in vigorously increasing the production of daily-use industrial products.
    We must not take the production of small commodities lightly. Don't think that it is not important because it is small. On the contrary, although small commodities are small and the output value is low, they are very important. Just think about people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Which of these can be separated from small commodities? With cloth, you need scissors, needles, and thread to sew clothes. With needles and thread, after the clothes are made, you still need buttons and collar buttons. For eating, you need a knife to cut vegetables, and you need bowls and chopsticks. Living in a house, you always have to prepare a lock, and you need a broom, dustpan, and mop. Riding a bicycle on the road, if the parts are broken, you need parts to repair them. When it rains, you need an umbrella. It can be seen that these small commodities are indispensable to everyone's daily life.
    Handicraft production in China has a long history and diverse characteristics and is an indispensable and important part of China's national economy. Therefore, we must stipulate the tasks of handicraft production according to social needs. Since the needs of people's lives are diverse, the variety of handicraft products, business methods, and production processes should also be diversified. The forms of ownership should also be diversified, with public ownership as the leader, giving full play to the superiority of collective ownership, and at the same time allowing the existence of a part of necessary individual handicrafts. This is beneficial to the development of production and the gradual improvement of people's lives. It is an inevitable trend for a part of handicraft production to gradually transition to mechanization and semi-mechanization, but there will always be some products that will still need to be produced by hand even after many, many years. Moreover, China's machinery industry is not strong enough at present, and it is impossible to produce all daily necessities by machine. Some people do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of handicrafts, so they feel that engaging in handicrafts, especially service industries, does not have much promise and is not an important job. Only engaging in "high, sophisticated, and large" modern industries is important and glorious. This view is extremely one-sided. Since without handicrafts and service industries, people's production and life will encounter great difficulties, handicrafts and service industries are of course important. As for whether engaging in handicrafts has promise and is glorious, it is not even a question. Our country is a socialist country led by the working class. We have basically eliminated the social system of exploitation of man by man. Our social division of labor is carried out in a planned way according to the needs of the entire society. No matter what kind of work you do, it is to serve the people and for socialist construction. As long as you are willing to study hard, work hard, do practical work, and work cleverly, you can have creativity and promise. In short, the employees who produce "high, sophisticated, and large" products are glorious, and the employees who produce "low, crude, and small" products and the employees in the service industries are also glorious. They have all made contributions to socialism. There is no reason to think that someone is higher or someone is lower. Therefore, the employees in handicrafts and service industries should fight with full energy for the rapid restoration and development of the production of handicraft small commodities.
    What is the key issue in rapidly and vigorously restoring handicraft small commodities at present? The central link is to strive to restore the original variety, quantity, and quality of handicraft products in the shortest possible time according to the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, and then strive for development on this basis. The comprehensive arrangement of handicrafts must fully implement the policy of handicrafts serving agriculture, serving people's lives, serving industrial construction, and serving exports. This means that we must take into account both production and life; take into account both domestic and foreign sales; and serve not only the modern industries that produce high-grade, precision, and large products, but also produce enough small commodities that are not high-grade, not precision, but are very much needed by the people. Both high, sophisticated, and large, and low, crude, and small must be taken into account. The two legs are indispensable.
    The characteristic of handicraft small commodities is that there are many varieties and can adapt to the various needs in people's lives. The variety of colors and designs is a traditional advantage of China's handicrafts. Now, the supply of daily-use small commodities in the market is in short supply, and a large part of it is not completely absent, but the variety has been reduced and cannot adapt to people's habits and needs. Therefore, restoring the variety of handicrafts should be placed in an extremely important position. How many colors and designs were originally produced, how many colors and designs should be restored. The demand for small commodities is extremely large, so it must be restored to the necessary quantity to basically guarantee the supply in the market. When the requirements for variety and quantity are met, the quality of small commodities must also be guaranteed. Otherwise, although the quantity is large and the variety is not small, but they are not durable and not applicable, they still cannot meet the requirements of consumers. Therefore, party committees at all levels and handicraft management agencies should take variety, quantity, and quality as the main standards when checking the production plan of handicrafts, rather than taking the total output value as the only standard.
    To restore the original variety, quantity, and quality of handicraft small commodities, an indispensable condition is that those transferred handicraft cadres, workers, and equipment that have been transferred out must basically return to their posts, because many handicraft workers have relatively long-term production experience and relatively advanced skills. They are most familiar with the needs of the people and know the most about the colors and designs produced in this industry. If these people do not return to their posts, it will be more difficult to restore production. Therefore, local enterprises that have transferred cadres and workers from handicrafts should proceed from the overall point of view and do everything possible to enable these comrades to return to the posts of handicraft production. The original handicraft production equipment should also be transferred back, and the missing ones should be replenished to provide the necessary material and technical conditions for the restoration and development of handicraft production. To make reasonable arrangements for handicraft production, there must be a sound organization to carry out regular leadership and management. Otherwise, the implementation of various arrangements will lack a guarantee. Therefore, establishing and strengthening the management agency of handicrafts is very important.
    When doing something, after the policy is clear, it depends on what method is used to do it. One method may have more, faster, better, and more economical effects, while another method may have the opposite effect. The same is true for running handicrafts. If we just reach out our hands and wait for the state to allocate raw materials, spread the stall too large, and want more money and more people, then we will definitely not do it well. If we are determined to rely on our own efforts, save every bit, and use poor methods to do it, then things will definitely be done quickly and well. Taking raw materials as an example, this is an important condition to ensure the restoration of the production of handicraft small commodities. When allocating major raw materials in a unified manner, the material distribution department should pay attention not to squeeze out the raw materials that should be allocated to handicrafts, and should take some convenient measures to enable handicrafts to continuously obtain the raw materials they need. But this is only one aspect, because the allocated raw materials always have a certain limit, and the needs are constantly growing. At the same time, many of the raw materials used in handicrafts are not valuable raw materials, and they have always been solved by the handicrafts themselves. Therefore, the more important aspect is to rely on the handicraft department to fully utilize various waste materials, to save raw materials, to find qualified substitutes, to cooperate between industry and commerce, and to "find rice to cook" in every possible way, to use fewer people, less money, but produce more and better things. Only in this way can we restore handicraft small commodities in the shortest period of time.
    The vigorous restoration and development of the production of handicraft small commodities must be carried out step by step. The current focus is on actively arranging the production of seasonal and urgently needed products to meet the immediate needs of the people. This is the most urgent task and should be done in a practical and combative manner. At the same time, we must actively prepare for autumn production. Many places have already done so, so the quantity and variety of small commodities are increasing day by day, and some small commodities that have been out of stock for a long time have reappeared on the market. It can be seen that as long as we are determined to do it, the restoration and development of the production of handicraft small commodities can have immediate results. Now it can be seen that as long as the party committees and governments at all levels proceed from reality, go all out, do everything possible, and earnestly grasp it, the production of daily-use industrial products can grow rapidly. Things are originally like this. Since our party can unite 600 million people, basically complete the socialist revolution, build a series of new industrial sectors that have never existed in China's history, and achieve great victories on the industrial, agricultural, and various fronts, we must also have a way to rapidly increase the production of daily-use industrial products, and we must be able to quickly restore the variety, quantity, and quality of handicraft small commodities in a short period of time, change the situation that the supply of some daily necessities falls short of demand, and make the growth of consumer goods gradually adapt to the growth of people's purchasing power. We must have such confidence and such ambition.

    迅速恢复和发展手工业小商品的生产
    最近各地都在大抓日用工业品的生产，许多日用品正在以很快的速度增长起来。
    1958年和今年上半年，日用工业品增长的幅度都是很大的，例如，今年1至5月，上海的轻工业（不包括纺织工业）生产，比去年同期增长了34％，而同一时期日用工业品的零售额却增长了41％。这就是说生产发展得很快，但购买力增长得更快。
    在日用工业品的供应中，一个比较突出的问题是部分小商品的供应不足。这些小商品绝大部分是手工业生产的。1958年我国的手工业有了很大的发展，这一年，全国手工业（包括转业过渡的）的总产值比1957年增长了近50％。这种发展速度是空前的，说明在大跃进的第一年，手工业所取得的成就也是很大的。但我们也应当看到：各类手工业的增长是不平衡的，为现代工业服务的手工业增长得多，增长得快些，为农业、为人民生活服务的手工业增长得少、增长得慢些。在去年的大跃进中，有一部分原来生产日用品的手工业被调去为工业建设服务了，另外一部分转业生产其它产品了。在修理、服务行业中，有一部分转为制造业了，因此就挤掉了一部分日用小商品的生产和修理服务业务，造成了部分小商品供应的紧张和人民生活的不便。因此，在大抓日用工业品的增产时，除了那些现代化的轻工业应当努力增产日用品以外，还必须重视迅速恢复和发展手工业小商品的生产，这是大力增产日用工业品中的重要一环。
    我们对小商品的生产绝不可等闲视之，不要以为它小就不重要，事情恰恰相反，小商品虽小，产值虽低，但却十分重要。试想想人们的衣食住行，哪一样能离开了小商品？有了布，要有剪刀、针和线才能缝起衣服；有了针和线，衣服做成了，还要有钮扣、领扣；吃饭要有切菜的刀，要有碗和筷子；住房子总要预备一把锁，要有扫帚畚箕、拖把。行路骑自行车，零件坏了，就要有零件来修配。下起雨来要用雨伞。由此可见，这些小商品都是每个人的日常生活所不可缺少的。
    手工业生产在我国有长期的历史和多种多样的特点，是我国国民经济不可缺少的一个重要组成部分。因此，我们必须按照社会需要规定手工业生产的任务，人民生活的需要既是多样性的，手工业产品的花色品种、经营方式、生产过程也都应当多样化。所有制的形式也应是多样的，以全民所有制为领导，发挥集体所有制的优越性，同时允许一部分必要的个体手工业的存在。这对于发展生产和人民生活的逐步改善是有利的。手工生产的一部分逐步向机械化半机械化过渡，这是必然的趋势，但是总有一部分产品，就是再经过许多许多年，仍然是要用手工生产的。何况目前我国的机械工业还不够强大，许多日用品还不可能都用机器来生产呢？有人对手工业的这种重要性认识不足，因而觉得搞手工业特别是服务性行业出息不大，不是什么重要的工作，只有从事“高、精、大”的现代工业，才重要，才光荣。这种看法是极为片面的。既然没有手工业，没有服务性行业，人们的生产和生活会遇到很大的困难，手工业和服务性行业当然是重要的。至于从事手工业有没有出息，是不是光荣，则更不是一个什么问题。我们的国家是工人阶级领导的社会主义国家，我们已基本上消灭了人剥削人的社会制度，我们的社会分工，是按照整个社会的需要有计划地进行的。不论做哪一种工作，都是为人民服务，都是为了社会主义建设。只要自己肯钻研，苦干、实干、巧干，就能有创造，有出息。总之，生产“高、精、大”产品的职工，是光荣的，生产“低、粗、小”产品的职工和服务性行业的职工也是光荣的，都对社会主义作出了贡献，没有理由认为谁高些，谁低些。因此，手工业、服务性行业的职工同志们，应当干劲百倍地为迅速恢复和发展手工业小商品的生产而紧张地战斗。
    目前迅速地大力恢复手工业小商品的关键问题是什么？中心一环是根据统筹兼顾全面安排的原则，争取在最短的时间内恢复手工业产品的原有品种、数量和质量，在这个基础上再力求发展。手工业的全面安排必须全面贯彻手工业为农业、为人民生活、为工业建设、为出口服务的方针，这就是说要兼顾生产和生活；兼顾内销和外销；既要为生产高级、精密、大型产品的现代工业服务，又要生产足够的不高级、不精密但人民却十分需要的小商品。高、精、大和低、粗、小都要兼顾，两条腿缺一不可。
    手工业小商品的特点是花色品种繁多，能适应人民生活中各式各样的需要，花色品种多这是我国手工业的一个传统优点。现在市场上日用小商品供不应求，有很大一部分并不是完全没有，而是品种减少了，不能适应人民的习惯和需要。因此恢复手工业的品种应当放在极重要的地位，原来生产多少花色品种，就应当恢复多少花色品种。小商品的需要量极大，因此必须恢复到必要的数量，才能基本保证市场的供应，品种数量的要求达到了，还必须保证小商品的质量，否则，数量虽多，品种也不少，但不耐用和不适用，仍然不能满足消费者的要求，因此各级党委和手工业的管理机构，在检查手工业的生产计划时，应当以品种、数量、质量为主要标准，而不应当以生产总值为唯一标准。
    要恢复手工业小商品原有的品种，数量和质量，一个必不可少的条件是：那些转业的手工业干部、工人和调出去的设备必须基本归队，因为许多手工业工人都有比较长期的生产经验和比较高级的技艺。他们最熟悉人民的需要，对本行业生产的花色品种也知道得最多，如果这些人不归队，恢复生产就比较困难。因此各个有从手工业转业过来的干部、工人的地方企业，应当从全局观点出发，尽一切可能使这些同志回到手工业生产的岗位上去。原有的手工业生产设备也要调回去，缺少的应当想办法补起来，使恢复和发展手工业生产能具有必需的物质技术条件，要使手工业生产得到合理的安排，一定要有一个健全的机构进行经常的领导和管理，不然各种安排就缺乏实现的保证，因此建立和加强手工业的管理机构，是十分重要的。
    办一件事，在方针明确了以后，还要看用什么方法去做。一种方法，效果可能又多又快又好又省，另一种方法，效果则可能相反。办手工业也是这样。如果我们只是伸着手，等待国家分配原材料，把摊子铺得大大的，钱要多，人要多，那末一定办不好。如果我们下定决心自力更生，一点一滴的节约，用穷办法来办，那末事情一定办得又快又好。以原材料来说，这是保证恢复手工业小商品生产的一个重要条件。物资分配部门在统筹分配主要原材料时，应当注意到不要把应当分给手工业的原材料挤掉，并且要采取一些方便的办法，使手工业能不断地获得自己所需要的原材料。但这只是一面，因为分配的原材料，总是有一定限度的，而需要总是不断增长的。同时手工业所用的许多原材料都不是什么贵重的原材料，历来也都是由手工业自己解决的，因此更重要的一面，还要靠手工业部门充分地利用各种废料，要节约原材料，寻找合格的代用品，要工商协作，千方百计地“找米下锅”，要人用得少，钱用得少，东西却生产得多，生产得好。只有这样，才能在最短的时期内，把手工业小商品恢复起来。
    大力恢复和发展手工业小商品的生产，必须有步骤地进行，目前的重点在于积极安排生产当令的和急需的产品，以满足人民的眼前需要，这是当务之急，应当切实地以战斗的姿态来做好。同时还要积极为秋季生产作好准备。许多地方已经这样做了，因而小商品的数量、品种日有增加，一些断档已久的小商品又陆续在市场上出现了。由此可见，只要我们下决心去做，恢复和发展手工业小商品的生产是可以立竿见影的。现在已经可以看出：只要各地党委和政府从实际出发，鼓足干劲，千方百计，认真地去抓，就能使日用工业品的生产迅速增长上去。事情本来也是这样，我们的党既然能团结六亿人民，基本完成了社会主义革命，建设起一系列我国历史上所没有的新的工业部门，在工业、农业和各个战线上都取得了很大胜利，我们也就一定有办法能够迅速增产日用工业品，就一定能在一个短时期内，迅速恢复手工业小商品的品种、数量和质量，改变部分日用品供不应求的局面，使消费资料的增长能逐步地和人民购买力的增长相适应。我们必须有这样的信心，有这样的志气。
