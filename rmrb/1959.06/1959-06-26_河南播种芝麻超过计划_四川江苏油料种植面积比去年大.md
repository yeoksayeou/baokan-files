Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 23rd: Henan Province, one of the major sesame-producing areas in the country, had sown more than 4,876,000 mu of sesame by the 19th, exceeding the sowing plan.

Chengdu, June 24th: Sichuan Province has currently sown over 2,880,000 mu of the two main oil crops, peanuts and sesame, an increase of 38% compared to last year's planting area.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 23rd: Jiangsu Province is seizing the opportunity to sow soybeans, sesame, and peanuts. This year, the province's sesame planting area will be doubled compared to last year. The Xuhuai (Xuzhou, Huaiyin) area and Tongyang (Nantong, Yangzhou) area, which have a tradition of sesame planting, are not only allocating a certain amount of large fields for dedicated sesame planting this year, but also intercropping sesame in grain and cotton fields, and planting sesame on many scattered plots of land.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 23rd: Most of the sesame sown in Henan Province has now grown to five or six inches tall.

Many areas, in response to the ideological concerns of some people who believe that sesame yields are low, incomes are small, and harvests are unstable, have strengthened publicity and education work, thus expanding the sesame planting area in many places. Nanyang Prefecture has sown more than 1,400,000 mu of sesame this year, an increase of nearly 19% compared to last year. Wuyang County in Xuchang Prefecture originally planned to sow 70,000 mu of sesame, but actually completed more than 77,600 mu. Various places have also used idle land and intercropping methods to expand the sesame planting area.

All localities have paid attention to the quality of sesame sowing, generally achieving sowing after plowing in early stubble fields and stubble destruction in late sowing; sowing methods have also been improved, generally changing from broadcasting to row sowing; superior varieties have been promoted, and rational close planting has been implemented, generally retaining 3,000 to 5,000 seedlings per mu.

In order to accumulate experience in increasing sesame yields, most counties and people's communes in sesame-producing areas have established sesame experimental fields and large-area high-yield plots. Deng County has 5,000 mu of sesame experimental fields. Shangcai County has 195 sesame high-yield plots with a total area of 6,500 mu.

Chengdu, June 24th: On the basis of a bumper harvest of rapeseed, Sichuan Province continues to rush-plant major spring oil crops, striving for an all-round bumper harvest of oil crops.

Currently, while grasping the field management of already sown oil crops, various places continue to expand the planting area. In addition to intensifying field planting, people are also making full use of field edges, the front and back of houses, seizing every opportunity to increase planting and intercropping of sesame, soybeans, sunflowers, etc.

In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient technical personnel in the new areas, many counties in Mianyang, Nanchong, Neijiang and other prefectures have opened short-term oil crop technology training classes, inviting experienced farmers and technicians to teach high-yield techniques for peanuts and sesame. Yibin Prefecture held an on-site peanut production meeting in Gaoxian County, a high-yield peanut area last year, summarizing experience and formulating a peanut cultivation technical plan centered on implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture.

A high-yield competition for oil crops, centered on increasing peanut and sesame production, has been launched in Sichuan Province. Ziyang County, which achieved large-area high yields of peanuts last year, has challenged Jianzhong County and Rongxian County, neighboring peanut-producing areas, to achieve large-area high yields of peanuts.

### 河南播种芝麻超过计划  四川江苏油料种植面积比去年大

    河南播种芝麻超过计划
    四川江苏油料种植面积比去年大
    据新华社郑州23日电　全国芝麻主要产区之一的河南省，到19日已经播种芝麻四百八十七万六千多亩，超额完成了播种计划。
    本报成都24日电　四川各地目前播种的花生、芝麻两项主要油料作物已达二百八十八万多亩，比去年的种植面扩大了38％。
    据新华社南京23日电　江苏省正抓紧时机播种大豆、芝麻、花生。今年全省芝麻播种面积将比去年扩大一倍。素有种植芝麻习惯的徐淮（徐州、淮阴）地区和通扬（南通、扬州）地区，今年除分出一定数量的大田专种芝麻外，还在粮田和棉田里套种，许多零星土地也种植了芝麻。
    据新华社郑州23日电　河南省播种的芝麻，目前大部分已经长到五、六寸高。
    不少地区针对部分群众认为芝麻产量低，收入小，收成不稳定等思想顾虑，加强了宣传教育工作，因而好多地方扩大了芝麻播种面积。南阳专区今年播种芝麻一百四十多万亩，比去年扩大近19％。许昌专区舞阳县原计划播种芝麻七万亩，结果完成了七万七千六百多亩。各地还利用空闲地和间作等办法，扩大芝麻播种面积。
    各地都注意了芝麻的播种质量，一般能做到早茬地犁后播种，晚播的灭茬；播种方法也有改进，一般都由撒播改为条播；推广了优良品种，实行了合理密植，一般每亩留苗三千到五千株。
    为了积累提高芝麻产量的经验，芝麻产区的多数县和人民公社都搞了芝麻试验田和大面积丰产方。邓县搞的芝麻试验田有五千亩。上蔡县搞了一百九十五块共六千五百亩的芝麻丰产方。
    本报成都24日电　四川各地在油菜丰收的基础上，继续赶种大春油料作物，力争油料全面大丰收。
    目前，各地一面抓紧已播油料作物的田间管理，一面继续扩大播种面积。人们在加紧大田种植以外，还尽量利用田边地角，屋前屋后，见缝插针，增种、间种芝麻、大豆、向日葵等。
    为了解决新区技术力量不足的困难，绵阳、南充、内江等专区许多县都开办了短期油料作物技术传授班，请有经验的农民和技术员，传授花生、芝麻的丰产技术。宜宾专区在去年花生高产区高县召开了花生生产现场会议，总结经验，制定出以贯彻农业八字宪法为中心的花生栽培技术方案。
    一个以增产花生、芝麻为中心的油料作物高产竞赛，已在四川省展开。去年获得花生大面积高产的资阳县，向邻近花生产区谫中县、荣县提出花生大面积高产挑战。
