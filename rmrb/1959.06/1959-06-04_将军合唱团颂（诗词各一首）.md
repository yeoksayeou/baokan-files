Ode to the Generals' Chorus (One Poem and One Lyric)
    Qian Junrui

At the opening ceremony of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Arts Festival, the Generals' Chorus performed, conducted by General Li Zhimin, singing "The Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," "On the Taihang Mountains," and "I Am a Soldier." At the enthusiastic request of the audience, they also sang "We Must Plant the Victory Flag on Taiwan." Their singing was resonant and powerful, moving tens of thousands of people. Generals becoming soldiers, generals becoming scholars, generals also becoming singers, how magnificent! Hence, this ode.

    I

    Generals strike fear into the enemy after hundreds of battles,
    Cutting through thorns and briars as if it were nothing.
    Today, singing with high spirits,
    The red flag will be planted all over Taiwan.

    II (Bodhisattva Man)

    The Long March of twenty-five thousand li, twenty years of fierce fighting, now standing tall. Winter goes and spring arrives, the fragrant flowers delight the people.

    The generals' spirit is strong, forming a chorus. They sing praises of the Eastern Dragon, their voices soar into the sky.

    将军合唱团颂（诗词各一首）
    钱俊瑞
    中国人民解放军文艺会演大会开幕式，有将军合唱团演出，由李志民上将指挥，唱“红军纪律歌”、“在太行山上”、“我是一个兵”，最后在观众热烈要求下，又唱一阕“一定要把胜利的旗帜插到台湾”。歌声沉雄，万人欢动。将军当兵，将军当秀才，将军又当歌手，懿欤盛哉！爰为颂。
    一
    将军百战敌胆寒，
    斩棘披荆若等闲。
    今日高歌风发处，
    红旗插遍到台湾。
    二（菩萨蛮）
    长征两万五千里，廾年鏖战今站起。冬去便逢春，花香喜煞人。
    将军意气壮，合唱成模样。弦颂东方龙，歌声薄太空。
