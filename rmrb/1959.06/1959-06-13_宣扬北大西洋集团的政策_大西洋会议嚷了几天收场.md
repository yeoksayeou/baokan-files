Xinhua News Agency report: The "Atlantic Conference," which opened in London on the 5th, concluded on the 10th.

This conference was initiated by the North Atlantic Group Parliamentary Conference and was nominally held to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the North Atlantic Group. The heads of government of the fifteen member countries of the group were all "sponsors" of the conference. Many of the representatives who attended the conference were well-known figures in the group, including Dutch Foreign Minister Luns, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, and former British Prime Minister Attlee.

The main issues discussed at the conference included the North Atlantic Treaty Organization itself, the "Cold War," the present and future of communism, and "aid" to underdeveloped countries. The purpose of convening this conference was to widely promote the so-called "Atlantic concept" and to try to get people to continue to support the increasingly dead-end so-called North Atlantic policy under some new names.

Supported by representatives who advocated the "Cold War" policy and the arms expansion policy, which occupied a dominant position, the resolution on military issues adopted by the conference attempted to continue to coerce the member countries of the group to mobilize and unify their military forces by using the so-called "communist threat" as an excuse. The resolution demanded that the member countries increase the number of their armed forces to "the level required by the strategic thinking of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization" without delay. The resolution also trotted out the long-bankrupt "deterrence" policy, threatening to use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union. It also called on member countries to consider how to strengthen "trust" in the group, believing that the so-called "retaliatory forces" of the United States and Britain would be "effectively utilized" under the conditions stipulated by the North Atlantic Group.

However, the development of history is, after all, merciless. The political resolution adopted by the conference acknowledged that the "communist world has made great achievements" in the post-war period, and that "communist ideas have taken increasingly deep roots in South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America." The resolution worried that such a decisive moment when "the current balance between East and West is completely changed" is getting closer and closer.

The conference's resolution on economic issues considered that the achievements of socialist countries in science and in the training of scientific personnel were a "serious challenge to the Atlantic Group." This resolution also revealed the great anxiety of the conference participants about the military power of the socialist camp countries. Under this resolution, the conference also proposed the establishment of a so-called "World Development Corporation" funded by private capital to provide matching capital and long-term loans to developing countries.

In his speech at the closing meeting on the 10th, former Belgian Prime Minister Van Zeeland once again reflected the dissatisfaction of some people within the group with the military nature of the North Atlantic Group. He said, "We hope to establish such an Atlantic Group that its scope will no longer only include military aspects, but will be expanded to political, economic, and cultural aspects."

### 宣扬北大西洋集团的政策  大西洋会议嚷了几天收场

    宣扬北大西洋集团的政策
    大西洋会议嚷了几天收场
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：5日在伦敦开幕的“大西洋会议”已于10日宣告收场。
    这次会议是北大西洋集团议会会议发起的，名义是纪念北大西洋集团成立十周年。这个集团十五个成员国的政府首脑都是会议的“赞助人”，参加会议的代表中，有很多是这个集团的知名人士，其中包括荷兰外交大臣伦斯、挪威外交大臣兰格、前英国首相艾德礼等。
    会议讨论的主要问题有北大西洋公约组织本身、“冷战”、共产主义的目前和未来以及对不发达国家的“援助”等问题。召开这次会议的目的是要广泛宣扬所谓“大西洋主张”，并且设法在一些新的名目下要人们继续支持日益穷途末路的所谓北大西洋政策。
    在占据优势的主张“冷战”政策和扩军政策的代表的支持下，会议通过的关于军事问题的决议企图以所谓“共产主义威胁”为借口，来继续胁迫这个集团的各成员国动员和统一它们的军事力量。这个决议要求各成员国毫不拖延地把它们的武装部队的人数增加到“北大西洋公约组织战略思想所要求的水平”。这个决议还抬出了早已破产的“威慑”政策，威胁着要使用核武器来对付苏联。并且要求各成员国考虑如何加强对这个集团的“信任”，相信美、英的所谓“报复力量”将在北大西洋集团所规定的情况下加以“有效地利用”。
    然而，历史的发展毕竟是无情的。大会通过的政治决议中承认，在战后期间“共产主义世界取得了巨大的成就”，“共产主义思想在南亚、中东、非洲和拉丁美洲各处扎下了越来越深的根”。决议担心说，“东西方目前的均势完全改变”的这样一个决定性的时刻越来越临近了。
    会议关于经济问题的决议认为，社会主义阵营国家在科学方面和培养科学人员方面的成就是对“大西洋集团的严重挑战”。这个决议也透露了大会参加者对社会主义阵营国家的军事威力极为不安。会议在这个决议的项目下，还建议由私人出资组织一个所谓“世界开发公司”，对正在发展中的国家提供对等资本和长期贷款。
  前比利时首相樊齐兰10日在闭幕会议上的发言再一次反映了这个集团内部某些人对北大西洋集团的军事性质的不满。他说，“我们希望建立这样一个大西洋集团，那就是它的范围不再只包括军事方面，而将扩大到政治、经济和文化方面”。
