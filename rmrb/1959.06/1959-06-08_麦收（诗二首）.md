    Wheat Harvest (Two Poems)
    Lü Jinzhi, member of Qingtou Commune, Yuncheng County
    Choosing Seedlings
    A yellow expanse in the distance,
    Waves chasing waves nearby,
    A clever and skilled girl choosing seedlings,
    Why is she standing blankly by the
      field?
    Every grain is plump,
    Every ear is strong,
    A clever and skilled girl choosing seedlings,
    Troubled, not knowing which plant to
      choose.
    Song of the Bumper Harvest
    The carts laugh "Gaga",
    The carrying pole dances on the shoulder,
    Thousands of carts and ten thousand loads run back,
    The wheat stacks on the threshing ground are higher than mountains.
    The wheat stacks on the threshing ground are higher than mountains,
    The warehouse’s big belly is also filled,
    The storekeeper worries, the captain laughs,
    The branch secretary is so happy that he doesn’t sleep all night.

    麦收（诗二首）
    运城县卿头公社社员　吕金枝
    选种姑娘
    远处一片黄，
    近处浪催浪，
    心灵手巧的选种姑娘，
    为什么呆呆地站在地边
      上？
    棵棵粒儿肥，
    穗穗籽儿壮，
    心巧手巧的选种姑娘，
    为难地不知该把那株选
      上。
    丰　收　歌
    车儿嘎嘎笑，
    扁担肩上跳，
    千车万担往回跑，
    场上麦垛比山高。
    场上麦垛比山高，
    仓库的大肚也装满了，
    保管愁，队长笑，
    乐得支书整夜不睡觉。
