U.S. Troops Get Out of South Korea!

The United States' launch of the Korean War of aggression is already nine years past, and the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement will soon be six years ago. The Chinese People's Volunteers have already completely withdrawn from Korea, but the American aggressor troops are still hanging around in the South. It prevents the Korean nation from unifying, dividing it into two halves; it further causes the comprehensive economic bankruptcy of the South Korean people. In South Korea, 2.6 million people are homeless, more than 6 million are unemployed, and hundreds of thousands are orphans and widows. Recently, a French journalist said a word of conscience, saying "In South Korea, to find the bud of democracy is more difficult than growing a rose from a garbage can!" South Korea has become a living hell, not an exaggeration at all! The devil who refuses to leave often wears a painted skin, disguising himself as an angel praising peace. However, the painter of the painted skin is worse than Hideki Tojo. Korea has been under the rule of Japanese imperialism, and today's South Korea has become a base for atomic missiles, posing an increased threat to peace in Asia and the world. Today, the people of Asia and the world are shouting in unison: "Devils in painted skins, stop deceiving! Immediately withdraw all invading troops from South Korea, so that the peaceful reunification of Korea can be realized as soon as possible!" Of course, this is just the beginning of showing peaceful sincerity; what you should do is not limited to this! You should abolish all overseas military bases and stop nuclear weapons tests on the high seas of the Pacific! Use peaceful negotiation to resolve international disputes, stop economic blockades, stop the arms race and the Cold War! The people of the world want you to show peaceful sincerity; please first immediately withdraw the invading troops from South Korea! Dear American people, you also love peace, please strengthen your control, and don't let the devils run rampant again! Please put yourselves in their shoes and feel the suffering of South Korea. If someone were to forcibly occupy American territory, would you stand by and be willing to accept it? No, you would definitely shout: "Occupiers get out!" Giant space rockets are already orbiting the sun, and the peaceful use of atomic energy will transform human history. The fate of mankind can now be controlled by ourselves; we want peaceful competition, mutual assistance, and the transformation of nature. Mankind has evolved to the people's century today, why can we still tolerate the unscrupulousness of the devils? The United States' launch of the Korean War of aggression is already nine years past, and the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement will soon be six years ago. Today, the people of Asia and the world are shouting in unison: "Devils in painted skins, stop deceiving! Immediately withdraw all invading troops from South Korea, so that the peaceful reunification of Korea can be realized as soon as possible!"

    美军撤出南朝鲜！
    郭沫若美国发动侵略朝鲜战争已经九周年，朝鲜停战协定的签字也快满六周年，中国人民志愿军已经全部撤出朝鲜，但是美国侵略军队却依然赖在南边，它使朝鲜民族不能统一，分成为两半；它更使南朝鲜人民全面地经济破产。南朝鲜人民有二百六十万人没有家，有六百多万人失业，几十万孤儿鳏寡。最近有一位法国记者说了句良心话，他说“在南朝鲜要想找寻民主的萌芽难于从垃圾箱里要长出一株玫瑰花！”南朝鲜已成人间地狱，一点也不虚夸！赖着不走的魔鬼还经常披着张画皮，它把自己粉饰成为歌颂和平的天使。然而画画皮的画家却赛过东条英机，朝鲜曾经受过日本帝国主义的统治，今天的南朝鲜更成了原子导弹基地，对亚洲与世界和平的威胁有增无已。今天亚洲和世界人民都在同声呼喊：“披着画皮的魔鬼们呵，不要再行诈骗；快把全部侵略军队立即撤出南朝鲜，好让朝鲜的和平统一能早一日实现！”当然这不过是表示和平诚意的开端，你们所应该做的事还不仅止这一点！你们应该撤销一切国外的军事基地，停止在太平洋公海上的核武器试验！用和平协商的方式来解决国际争端，停止经济封锁，停止军备竞赛和冷战！全世界人民都要你们表示和平诚意，请首先把侵略军队立即撤出南朝鲜！亲爱的美国人民，你们同样爱好和平，请你们加紧管制，莫再让魔鬼们横行！你们请将心比心，体贴南朝鲜的苦境。如果有人要把美国领土用武力霸占，请问，你们是否会袖手旁观，心甘情愿？不会的，你们一定会高呼：“霸占者滚蛋！”巨型的宇宙火箭已在绕着太阳旋转，原子能的和平利用要把人类史改观。人类的命运已经能够由自己来掌管，我们要和平竞赛，相互协助，改造自然。人类已经进化到了人民世纪的今天，为什么还能容忍魔鬼们的肆无忌惮？美国发动侵略朝鲜战争已经九周年，朝鲜停战协定的签字也快满六周年，今天亚洲和世界人民都在同声呼喊：“披着画皮的魔鬼们呵，不要再行诈骗；快把全部侵略军队立即撤出南朝鲜，好让朝鲜的和平统一能早一日实现！”
