Further Develop the Pharmaceutical Industry
By Our Newspaper Commentator

The pharmaceutical industry is not an industry that produces ordinary consumer goods. Its products are essential material resources for maintaining people's health and rescuing the injured and critically ill, and it has a direct impact on the productive endeavors of society.

Drugs and chemistry are closely related. This is because: the purification of effective drug ingredients must be refined; and there are many advantages to producing natural substances by chemical synthesis, such as the production volume can be large or small, and it is not restricted by seasons, regions, and natural resources. Therefore, with the improvement of science and technology, some substances that originally had to be obtained from natural sources can now be produced artificially. The pharmaceutical industry has increasingly developed into an important department of the chemical industry.

In the past few years, China's pharmaceutical industry has developed greatly, but it must have even greater development in the future. This is because: with the improvement of people's material living standards, although infectious diseases will gradually be eliminated in the future, measures to prevent diseases will not be reduced. At the same time, people need a large number of auxiliary nutrients such as vitamins, and drugs such as hormones to regulate human functions to prevent functional diseases, and so on. In addition, some drugs now have new and broader uses. For example, the application of antibiotics in raising livestock, poultry, and silkworms has already begun. Para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, a by-product of sulfonamide production, has been found to be an effective agent for preventing wheat rust, and so on. These medicines should not only gradually meet people's needs in terms of production quantity, but also require the production of new drugs with higher efficacy and fewer side effects in terms of quality. Therefore, the development of the pharmaceutical industry is limitless.

However, there are currently some difficulties in the pharmaceutical industry. For existing products, the biggest difficulty is the shortage of chemical raw materials; for new products, the production technology barrier must be overcome. We must try our best to solve these problems.

First of all, we must start from self-reliance and strengthening cooperation to resolve the contradiction between the development of pharmaceutical industrial production and the supply of chemical raw materials. Self-reliance means that in addition to the basic chemical raw materials that are generally used in large quantities and supplied by chemical plants, certain key chemical raw materials and intermediates that are urgently needed only by the pharmaceutical industry should be encouraged to be produced by pharmaceutical factories themselves. For example, the sulfonamide factory built during the First Five-Year Plan period was equipped with a workshop for producing chlorosulfonic acid; the chloramphenicol workshop was equipped with a section for manufacturing ethylbenzene. Experience has proven that this is completely correct. If we had passively waited for the solution to the supply of chlorosulfonic acid and ethylbenzene at that time, the mass production of sulfonamides and chloramphenicol would have been affected. On the other hand, because the raw materials required for the production of each drug are very numerous, for example, the production of penicillin requires thirty-nine different raw materials, and chloramphenicol requires thirty-six, etc., it is impossible for pharmaceutical factories to produce all these raw materials themselves. Therefore, the cooperation and support of various related industrial departments, especially the heavy organic synthesis industry department, is very necessary.

Secondly, we must carry out a mass movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation, and improve the level of industrial production technology, so as to save raw materials and increase output. The production technology of the pharmaceutical industry is relatively complex. Generally, the production process is long, the types of raw materials required are numerous, and the raw material consumption quota is high. Because of this, it is particularly beneficial to make achievements in simplifying processes, increasing yields, saving raw materials, and finding substitutes in technological improvements. In the past few years, China's pharmaceutical industry has taken some measures to increase production and practice economy, and has achieved great economic results. In terms of increasing production, for example, due to the improvement of fermentation units, the antibiotic production capacity of the North China Pharmaceutical Factory has increased by about three times compared with the original design. Due to the improvement of chemical synthesis methods, the production capacity of the sulfonamide, chloramphenicol, and phenacetin workshops built during the First Five-Year Plan period has increased by five to ten times after adjusting equipment and adding some equipment. The reduction in production costs and raw material consumption quotas can also illustrate the problem. In 1957, the production cost of penicillin was reduced to 26.7% of that in 1953; during the same period, sulfathiazole was reduced to 41.1%. Since the cost of raw materials accounts for the main part of the production cost of pharmaceutical products, the reduction in raw material consumption quota is actually close to the percentage of cost reduction. But despite this, the amount of various raw materials consumed in production is still very large, and there is much room for technological innovation.

Third, we must strengthen management. Recently, the production tasks have been relatively heavy, the supply of raw materials has been relatively tight, and there have been relatively many new workers; we should pay special attention to management, especially workshop management. Improving management, establishing reasonable rules and regulations, and formulating reasonable operating procedures are necessary for the smooth development of the movement to increase production and practice economy, and the steady increase in output and yield.

Fourth, conscientiously implement inter-factory cooperation, so that complex new products can successfully pass the technical barrier. Since last year, pharmaceutical factories across the country have been very enthusiastic about trial-producing new products, which is a good thing. But on the other hand, we should also fully recognize the complexity of the trial production of certain new products, and correctly estimate the technical difficulties that will be encountered in the production process. The trial production of certain new products, such as new antibiotics, synthetic vitamins, hormones, etc., often involves some new chemical raw materials, intermediates, and many new technologies that have not yet been fully mastered by us. If everyone does it separately, even with inter-factory exchange of experience, there will inevitably be some duplication in the work; and because the strength is scattered, it will not be easy to pass the production technology barrier. Therefore, we must further organize and conscientiously implement inter-factory cooperation. Under unified command, we should concentrate our efforts to break through key problems separately. For intermediates that can be prepared separately, there should also be a certain division of labor, so that they can be shared in the future. Doing so can not only reduce the workload and accelerate the progress of trial production, but also lay the foundation for further division of labor and cooperation in future production.

    进一步发展医药工业
    本报评论员
    医药工业不是生产普通消费品的工业，它的产品是维护人民健康、挽救伤病垂危的重要物质资料，对社会的生产事业有直接影响。
    药物和化学的关系十分密切。这是因为：药物有效成分的提纯要精益求精；并且用化学合成方法生产天然物质的优点很多，如产量可大可小，不受季节、地区和天然资源的限制等。因此，随着科学技术水平的提高，一些原来要由天然来源获得的物质，现在也能用人工进行生产了。医药工业已经日益发展成为化学工业中的一个重要部门。
    几年来，我国医药工业已经有了很大的发展，但是今后一定还要有更大的发展。这是因为：随着人民物质水平的提高，今后传染病虽然会逐渐消除，然而预防疾病的措施却不会减少。同时，人民大量需要像维生素之类的辅助性营养品，需要像激素之类的调节人体机能的药物以预防机能性的疾病，等等。此外，有些药物现在已经有了新的更广阔的用途。例如抗菌素在饲养家畜、家禽和养蚕方面的应用已经有了开展。磺胺生产中副产的对氨基苯磺酸被发现为防治小麦锈病的有效药剂等等。这些药品，不但在生产的量的方面要逐步满足人们的需要，而且在质的方面还要求多生产疗效更高副作用更小的新药。因此，医药工业的发展是无限的。
    然而，当前医药工业上却有一些困难。对原有的产品来说，最大的困难是化工原料不足；对新增的产品来说，还要过生产技术关。这些问题，我们一定要努力设法解决。
    首先要从自力更生和加强协作两个方面来着手解决医药工业生产发展和化工原料供应之间的矛盾。自力更生，就是说除了大宗通用的基本化工原料由化工厂供应以外，某些只有医药工业迫切需要的关键性化工原料和中间体，应该鼓励制药工厂自己生产。例如，第一个五年计划期中建成的磺胺工厂中就附有生产氯磺酸的车间；合霉素车间中就附有制造乙苯的工段。经验证明这样做是完全正确的，如果当时因循等待氯磺酸和乙苯供应问题的解决，那末磺胺和合霉素的大量生产势必受到影响。另一方面，由于生产每种药品所需原料都十分繁多，例如生产青霉素需要三十九种不同原料，合霉素需要三十六种等等，这些原料不可能一一都由制药工厂自制自给，因此各有关工业部门、尤其是重有机合成工业部门的协作和支援是十分必要的。
    其次，要开展以技术革新为中心的群众性增产节约运动，提高工业生产技术水平，以节约原料和增加产量。医药工业的生产技术是比较复杂的，一般生产过程长，需要的原料种类多，原料的消耗定额高，正因为此，就格外有利于在简化流程、提高收得率，节约原料、寻找代用等技术改进方面做出成绩来。几年来我国医药工业采取了一些增产节约措施，取得了巨大的经济效果。增产方面，例如由于发酵单位的提高，华北药厂抗菌素生产能力比原设计提高约三倍。由于化学合成方法的改进，第一个五年计划期间建成的磺胺、合霉素和非那西丁车间，在调整设备和增加了部分设备之后，生产能力提高了五至十倍。生产成本和原料消耗定额的降低也同样能够说明问题。1957年青霉素生产成本降低为1953年的26.7％；同期间磺胺噻唑降低为41.1％。由于原料成本占医药产品生产成本中的主要部分，原料消耗定额的降低实际上与成本降低的百分数相接近。但尽管如此，目前生产中消耗的各种原料量仍然很大，进行技术革新是大有可为的。
    第三、要加强管理工作。最近一个时期，生产任务比较重，原料供应比较紧，新工人比较多；应该特别抓紧管理工作，尤其是车间管理工作。把管理工作提高，建立合理的规章制度，制订合理的操作规程，增产节约运动才能很好地展开，产量和收率才能稳步提高。
    第四、认真地实行厂际合作，使复杂的新产品过好技术关。去年以来，全国制药工厂试制新产品的热情很高，这是一件好事。但在另一方面也应当充分地认识某些新产品试制工作的复杂性，正确估计在投入生产过程中所将遇到的技术困难。某些新产品，例如新抗菌素、合成维生素、激素等的试制，往往牵涉到一些新的化学原料、中间体以及许多目前还没有被我们所完全掌握的新技术。大家分头去搞，即使有厂际经验交流，在工作上也难免有所重复；而且由于力量分散，在生产技术上就不容易过关。因此，必须进一步组织起来，认真地实行厂际合作。在统一指挥下集中力量去分别突破关键性的问题。凡是可以分开来制备的中间体，也应当有一定的分工，将来可以互通有无。这样做不但可以缩小工作面，加速试制工作的进度，还可以为将来生产上进一步的分工合作打下基础。
