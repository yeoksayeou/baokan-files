Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Today marks the Beginning of Grain in Ear (芒种). With the start of the wheat harvest in the Yellow River basin, the first joyous wheat harvest campaign since the communization of rural China has fully unfolded. Currently, in the golden wheat sea of the main wheat-producing areas on both banks of the Yellow River, millions of farmers are rushing to harvest and thresh, carefully reaping and threshing, striving to bring every grain home.

The battle to rush-harvest wheat began in the Yangtze River basin in late May. Subsequently, wheat in the Huai River and Yellow River basins successively ripened. The vast number of farmers, who had long been prepared, took up their sickles and went into battle, beginning the harvest. Currently, in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces, three to four million to seven to eight million people are rushing to harvest every day. Across thousands of miles of wheat fields, there are people reaping, threshing, hauling, and transporting everywhere. Animal-drawn carts and handcarts transporting wheat are coming and going in endless streams. Children and the elderly are also participating in the rush harvest, gleaning wheat ears in the fields and on the roads. To speed up the harvesting and ensure the bumper harvest is secured, many people's communes in various provinces have set up camps in the fields for their rush harvest shock brigades; many wheat harvest headquarters have also moved to the fields to work, with cadres and commune members eating, living, and harvesting together in the fields. At present, Hubei Province, where the wheat ripened earlier, has basically completed the harvest. By the 4th, Henan Province had harvested more than half of its wheat.

This year, some areas in the Yangtze River basin experienced continuous rain when the wheat harvest began, and Henan Province, southern Shaanxi, and southern Hebei in the Yellow River basin also experienced wind and rain at the beginning of the month. Local leadership departments at all levels and the vast number of farmers, who were prepared for rain damage, immediately launched a struggle to combat rain and seize wheat when the wind and rain struck. When Henan received the forecast that there would be wind and rain on June 3rd, millions of the rush harvest army in each special district rushed to harvest mature wheat and rush to transport and stack it overnight. In Xuchang Special District, 99% of the 6.28 million mu of wheat that had already been harvested was rushed to the threshing grounds and stacked before the wind and rain arrived. After the Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on preventing rain damage at midnight on the 4th, many areas made arrangements to strive for a complete victory in "snatching food from the tiger's mouth."

In the battle to rush-harvest wheat, all localities paid close attention to careful reaping and threshing to ensure that every grain returned to the granary. Communes in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces have generally implemented a wheat harvest responsibility system that stipulates quality, quantity, time, person, remuneration, and land plot. Many communes have also formulated detailed harvesting plans or agreements to ensure that reaping, threshing, drying, and storing are carried out simultaneously, and that nothing is left unharvested, untransported, unthreshed, or unswept. This year, communes in Jiangsu Province generally achieved light reaping, light placing, light harvesting, light bundling, and light carrying, ensuring that fields, roads, and firewood were clean, and that the wheat was stacked well, covered well, and stored well. Hubei Province attached great importance to the acceptance work, with many places accepting as they harvested. In Weinan and Dali counties in Shaanxi Province, some units that were sloppy in harvesting were criticized and educated, and then re-threshed the wheat a second time. Some communes in Henan and Hebei provinces also launched competitions focused on good harvesting, good distribution, good procurement, good transportation, and good planting, achieving simultaneous harvesting, threshing, and storage.

During this year's wheat harvest, all localities organized support troops, and some areas also organized large-scale cooperation to accelerate the wheat harvest. Cadres from government agencies, urban residents, workers, students, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the area in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Anhui, Hubei, and other places organized large-scale wheat harvest teams and rushed to the wheat harvest front to support the rush harvest. Some areas also carried out large-scale labor and animal power cooperation between communes and teams based on the principle of equivalent exchange. The commercial, health, and other departments of the communes in various localities also closely cooperated with the wheat harvest. All rural service departments and personnel in Ruicheng County, Shanxi Province, generally provided supplies to the fields, tool repair to the fields, and medical prevention to the fields. Some canteens in Shandong Province also launched competitions to support the wheat harvest.

To secure the fruits of the bumper harvest, all localities made preparations for labor, tools, etc., based on past experience before the start of the large-scale wheat harvest campaign. All localities universally checked and repaired sickles, vehicles, and other wheat harvesting tools, and some areas also manufactured a batch of summer harvest tools. This year, Henan Province added more than 20 million pieces of main summer harvest tools such as sickles, rakes, and vehicles.

After calculating the labor requirements for the wheat harvest, eight counties in Hebei Province, including Xushui and Anguo, organized specialized teams for harvesting, transporting, threshing, summer planting, and summer hoeing based on labor strength, technical expertise, and wheat field distribution. Before harvesting wheat, many communes in various areas organized forces to rush to weed, topdress, strengthen the field management of spring-sown crops, and prepare for summer planting. As soon as the wheat ripened, they concentrated superior labor to invest in the wheat harvest battle.

All localities strengthened leadership over the wheat harvest. Major wheat-producing areas such as Shandong and Henan issued instructions and held telephone or broadcast conferences before the wheat harvest to make arrangements for this year's wheat harvest. Wheat harvest command organizations were generally established from the province to the special district, county, and commune, and some areas also transferred cadres to the fields for specific leadership.

Simultaneous with the wheat harvest, a surging summer production upsurge has also formed in many places. Many areas achieved simultaneous reaping, threshing, plowing, and planting while rushing to harvest wheat. According to recent incomplete statistics from Hubei Province, more than 10 million mu of intermediate rice have been sown, more than 2 million mu of summer coarse grains have been sown, and a certain amount of manpower has been organized to strengthen the field management of cotton, intermediate rice, and other crops, striving for an autumn harvest.

    顶风冒雨收打拉运　又快又细颗粒还家
    黄河两岸千军万马收麦忙
    新华社6日讯　今天已到芒种。随着黄河流域的麦收开始，我国农村人民公社化以后第一次喜庆丰收的麦收战役已经全线展开。目前在黄河两岸主要产麦区的金色麦海里，千百万农民正在抢收抢打，细收细打，力争颗粒还家。
    抢收小麦的战斗，从5月下旬开始就在长江流域展开。接着淮河和黄河流域的小麦相继黄熟。早已秣马厉兵做好了准备的广大农民，相继挥镰上阵，开始收割。目前，河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西、江苏、安徽等省每天都有三、四百万到七、八百万人突击抢收。千里麦海，到处都是收、打、拉、运的人群，运送小麦的畜力车、手推车等络绎不绝，少年儿童和老人，也参加了抢收，在地里、路上拾取麦穗。为了加快收割速度保证丰收到手，各省许多人民公社的抢收突击队都在田间安营下寨；许多麦收指挥部也搬到田间办公，干部和社员在田间同吃同住，一同抢收。目前，小麦成熟较早的湖北省已经基本收割完毕。河南省到4日已经割了一半以上。
    今年，长江流域有些地区正当麦收开始时阴雨连绵，黄河流域的河南全省和陕西南部、河北南部在月初也有风雨。对防止雨害早有准备的各地各级领导部门和广大农民，当风雨袭来时，立即展开了抗雨夺麦护麦的斗争。河南各地接到6月3日将有风雨的预报时，各专区的几百万抢收大军，都连夜抢收成熟的小麦和抢运、抢垛。许昌专区已经收割的六百二十八万亩小麦，在风雨到来之前有99％抢运到场里，并且全部垛好。农业部4日夜十二时发出防止雨害的通知后，很多地区都做了部署，力争取得“龙口夺食”的彻底胜利。
    在突击抢收小麦的战斗中，各地都非常注意细收细打，保证颗粒还仓。河北、山东、河南、江苏、安徽等省的公社大都推行了定质、定量、定时、定人、定报酬、定地块等麦收责任制，有很多公社还订了细收细打计划或公约，做到了边收、边打、边晒、边进仓和收净、运净、打净、扫净。江苏省今年一般公社都做到了轻割、轻放、轻收、轻捆、轻挑，田净、路净、柴净，垛好、盖好、保管好。湖北省对验收工作很重视，不少地方是收一块、验收一块。陕西省渭南、大荔等县有些收割粗糙的单位，受到批评教育后，重打二遍。河南、河北两省的一些公社还展开了以收好、分配好、征购好、运好、种好为内容的竞赛，做到了随收、随打、随入仓。
    在今年的麦收中，各地都组织了支援大军，有些地区还组织了大协作，加快了麦收进度。河北、河南、山东、陕西、安徽、湖北等地的机关干部、城镇居民、工人、学生和驻在当地的人民解放军官兵都纷纷组织了麦收大军，开赴麦收前线支援抢收。有些地区公社与公社、队与队之间还根据等价交换的原则展开了劳、畜力大协作。各地公社的商业、卫生等部门也紧密地配合了麦收。山西省芮城县所有的农村服务部门和人员普遍做到物品供应到田，农具修配到田和医疗预防到田。山东省各地的一些食堂还为支援麦收展开了竞赛。
    为了把丰收的果实拿到手，在大规模的麦收战役开始前，各地根据往年经验，对劳力、工具等都做了准备。各地普遍检查、修补了镰刀、车辆等收麦工具，有些地区还制造了一批夏收工具。河南省今年增补了镰刀、鐥刀、车辆等主要夏收工具二千多万件。
    河北省徐水、安国等八个县算了麦收用工账后，根据劳力强弱，技术特长和麦田分布情况，组织了收割、运输、打轧和夏种、夏锄等专业队。许多地区的公社在收麦前都组织力量突击锄草、追肥，加强春播作物的田间管理和夏种的准备工作。小麦一成熟，就集中优势劳力投入麦收战役。
    各地都加强了对麦收的领导。山东、河南等主要产麦区，在麦收前都发了指示，召开了电话会议或广播会议，对今年的麦收做了部署。从省到专区、县、公社一般都建立了麦收指挥机构，有些地区还抽调干部到田间进行具体领导。
    与麦收同时，一个风起云涌的夏季生产高潮也在许多地方形成。许多地区在抢收小麦的同时，做到了随收、随打、随犁、随种。据湖北省最近的不完全统计，已播种中稻一千多万亩，播夏杂粮二百多万亩，同时还组织一定人力加强对棉花、中稻及其它作物的田间管理，争取秋季丰收。（附图片）
