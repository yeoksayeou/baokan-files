Timber is an important material for production and construction and an indispensable commodity for people's lives. Extracting 10,000 tons of coal requires about 220 cubic meters of pit props; laying one kilometer of railway requires 260 to 300 cubic meters of sleepers; other industries such as the manufacture of vehicles, ships, paper, furniture, and matches also require a large amount of timber. The quantity of timber produced and whether it can be supplied in a timely manner directly affect the scale and speed of national construction. Therefore, in this year's continued great leap forward in the national economy, timber production must also have a corresponding increase, and timber production departments must comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the state's timber production plan by tree species, quantity, and by quarter and month; timber using departments must practice strict economy and overcome waste.

The first half of this year's timber production has achieved great results. By June 15th, various forest areas, without adding mechanical equipment and with production capacity equal to the same period last year, had produced more than 4.3 million cubic meters of timber more than in the first half of last year. As of June 15th, the Inner Mongolia forest area had completed 60.7% of the annual timber production plan; Heilongjiang Province's timber production from January to May increased by 48.8% compared with the same period last year, exceeding the state plan. In Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces, under the command of party and government leaders, the broad masses of forestry workers and commune members fought bravely, battled stubbornly against floods, and worked day and night to rush and salvage timber. By the end of May, forest areas such as Nanping, Taining, and Jian'ou in Fujian Province had successively overfulfilled the timber production plans for the first half of the year. The good situation on the timber production front is the result of the attention of party and government leaders at all levels, coupled with the active efforts of the broad masses of forestry workers and commune members, and we should express our heartfelt respect to them!

However, the need for timber is always increasing. Having completed the plan and increased production in the first half of the year, we must continue to increase production in the second half. Calculating timber production is not just about felling trees and considering the task complete, but also requires timely transport from the forest area. Therefore, party and government leading organs and forestry departments at all levels must continue to firmly grasp the work of timber felling and transportation, and mobilize the broad masses of forestry workers and commune members to continue to exert their energy and strive for even greater production increases in the second half of the year.

What issues need to be urgently resolved at present? For state-owned timber felling enterprises, in addition to increasing some necessary equipment, parts, and production facilities to increase the enterprise's production capacity, the main task is to strengthen the enterprise's business management and improve labor productivity. State-owned felling enterprises are the main force on the timber production front, and the timber they produce accounts for about two-thirds of the country's total timber production. Most of these state-owned felling enterprises are concentrated in the forest areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. Although these forest areas were developed earlier and have some mechanical equipment, due to the rapid development of production, the increase in production capacity cannot meet the needs of production development, and the technical foundation of production is still very weak. These felling enterprises are also mostly distributed in mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, the enterprise area is large and scattered, the work lines are very long, and the mobility is very high, so for a long time, the business management work of some felling enterprises has not been able to meet the requirements of production development. In addition, in recent years, new workers have been continuously increasing, and technical education has not kept up, which has also hindered the improvement of labor productivity. Some enterprises broke some unreasonable rules and regulations during the Great Leap Forward last year, but some necessary and feasible systems were also abolished, and new rules and regulations were not immediately established to replace them after they were broken. Some units also abolished some necessary functional institutions and professional personnel. These problems have a certain impact on production and must be quickly and effectively improved in business management on the basis of continuing to carry out mass movements in order to effectively improve production. The Forestry Administration Bureau of the Mudanjiang Forest Area in Heilongjiang Province, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, promptly deployed and inspected production, organized various enterprises to conduct evaluations, exchanged experiences, and improved various rules and regulations, especially various responsibility systems, and adopted measures to ensure ten-day targets with daily targets, and monthly targets with ten-day targets, and to firmly grasp the daily shift production plan, the average daily output in May increased by 50% compared with April, and the monthly plan was overfulfilled. The experience of the Mudanjiang Forest Area is very valuable, it tells us that business management must not only be improved, but can also be quickly improved, and the key lies in the fact that the Party Committee and the Forestry Administration Department must take hold of it. At present, in order to better utilize the utilization rate of existing mechanical equipment, we must first strengthen the inspection, repair, and maintenance of machinery, further improve operating skills, and establish and improve various rules and regulations. This is an important link in improving the timber transportation capacity of state-owned felling enterprises and is also one of the key issues in increasing timber production.

China's timber production relies on state-owned felling enterprises on the one hand and people's communes on the other. Doing a good job in timber production in people's communes can not only support national construction, but also increase the income of the communes, which is conducive to the further development of production in people's communes. People's communes that produce timber are mainly located in various provinces and autonomous regions in the south. This year, the timber production tasks undertaken by the people's communes are very heavy, and party and government leaders at all levels must earnestly and frequently help them to grasp this production task. At present, the most important problems in timber production in people's communes are insufficient labor and improper allocation. Timber production in people's communes is highly seasonal, with one season following another, and production is also very tense. The general rule is: felling in autumn and winter, and transporting in spring and summer. Timber felling and transportation are very complicated and heavy manual labor, and also require certain skills. According to these production characteristics, people's communes must establish and improve specialized timber production organizations (logging yards or logging teams run by the commune or team, etc.) and implement year-round professional management. It is not feasible to temporarily transfer personnel, because people who are temporarily transferred are not familiar with the business, the production efficiency is very low, and it is also easy to cause timber losses and waste and personal injury accidents. The timber production task of Huitong County in Hunan Province this year has increased by more than two times compared with last year, precisely because it has fixed a basic professional team of 8,000 people, who are engaged in forestry production all year round, and when the timber production season is tight, it organizes a batch of labor to assist, so by mid-May this year, it basically completed this year's mountain short-distance land transportation task. With a professional team engaged in timber production, not only can labor productivity be greatly improved and the income of the people's communes be increased, but also labor can be saved, which is conducive to agricultural production, and all production can be carried out in an orderly manner. After the professional team is organized, the people's commune should give appropriate consideration to wages and rations according to the characteristics of the high labor intensity of timber production, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the commune members engaged in timber production.

In order to complete this year's timber production task of the people's communes, we must currently grasp the timber transportation work. In timber production in the southern provinces, most of the timber felled must be transported by short-distance land transportation in the mountains, and then transported down using mountain streams. The season when there is a lot of water in the streams and it is suitable for floating timber is only spring and summer. The current moment is a favorable opportunity. If the timber is not rushed down during this good water season, there is a danger that this year's timber production plan will fall through. Therefore, in addition to the relevant departments doing their best to supply some equipment necessary for water transportation, the people's communes should properly arrange labor, seize the current favorable season, and strive to transport all the timber to the riverside and roadside, so that the next stage can use large river floating or vehicle transportation.

Heavy manual labor still accounts for a large proportion of timber production in our country, so it is even more important to widely carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements in timber production departments. In recent years, under the leadership of the party, the broad masses of forestry workers and commune members have improved and created many new production tools. In the current booming movement to increase production and practice economy, we should further carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and focus the main attack on the weakest links in production. From a national perspective, no matter in the south or the north, the most important link in timber production at present is timber collection and transportation. This problem is also determined by the characteristics of timber production. Because felling trees does not take much effort, most of the labor and materials in timber production are used in the timber collection and transportation process. If this production process can be semi-mechanized or mechanized, the labor productivity of timber production can be greatly improved, and labor conditions can be greatly improved. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to mobilizing the broad masses of workers and commune members to boldly carry out technical innovation, special attention should also be paid to promoting the existing effective advanced tools, advanced operating methods, and experience.

Strengthening timber allocation and transportation is also an important issue in current timber production. Various places must ensure that timber is supplied according to tree species and according to plan, and in particular, they must vigorously guarantee the supply of pit props to support coal enterprises in completing their production tasks. While ensuring key supplies, we must also take care of the supply of general timber in order to meet the needs of various constructions and people's lives.

To complete this year's timber production task, in addition to the active efforts of forestry workers and commune members, the railway department also needs to allocate vehicles in a timely and reasonable manner; the transportation department needs to allocate a certain number of trucks, tugboats, and other transportation tools to transport the accumulated timber at the roadside or storage yard. The commercial department should further strengthen the supply of materials to the forest area. Local machinery repair and parts manufacturing enterprises should also do their best to support the repair and maintenance of timber felling and transportation machinery.

Increasing production and practicing economy is the fundamental method of building socialism. While vigorously increasing timber production, we must vigorously conserve timber and overcome waste. In terms of timber conservation, a lot of work has been done in the past few years and great achievements have been made. However, there is still great potential for conservation in all aspects from felling to processing and utilization. For example, the stump height is stipulated by the state to be ten to twenty centimeters, but the stump height of some felling enterprises is as high as fifty to sixty centimeters. In addition, about 12% of the timber yield on the mountain is comprised of treetops and branches, etc. If they are well utilized, not only can the timber utilization rate be improved, but also the output of pit props can be increased. As for the valuable experience gained by some using units in saving timber, it should also be widely promoted. For example, the timber recycling and utilization, and the improvement of reuse rates, as well as the anti-corrosion experience of the coal industry and railways are all very good. At present, China's forest resources are not abundant, but the amount of timber we need for construction and production is increasing. Therefore, we should cherish every cubic meter and every cubic decimeter of timber, and achieve reasonable processing and make the most of everything.

    增产木材节约木材
    木材是生产和建设的重要材料，是人民生活不可缺少的物资。采一万吨煤，需要二百二十立方公尺左右的坑木；铺设一公里铁路，需要二百六十至三百立方公尺的枕木；其它如制造车辆、船舶、纸张、家具以及火柴等，都需要大量木材。木材产量多少、能不能及时供应，直接影响到国家建设的规模和速度。因此，在今年国民经济的继续大跃进中，木材生产也必须有相应的增长，木材生产部门必须按材种、按数量、按季按月地全面完成与超额完成国家的木材生产计划；木材使用部门，必须要厉行节约，克服浪费。
    今年前半年的木材生产取得了很大成绩。到6月15日止各林区在没有增添机械设备，生产能力和去年同期相等的情况下，比去年上半年多生产了四百三十多万立方公尺木材。内蒙古林区截至6月15日已完成全年木材生产计划的60.7％；黑龙江省1至5月份木材产量比去年同期增长了48.8％，超额完成了国家计划。福建、广东等省，在党政领导同志的指挥下，广大林业职工和社员群众英勇奋战，同洪水顽强搏斗，夜以继日地抢运和打捞木材。5月底，福建省的南平、泰宁、建瓯等林区，已先后超额完成了上半年的木材生产计划。木材生产战线上的良好情况，是各级党政领导的重视，加上林区广大职工和公社社员群众积极努力的结果，应该向他们表示衷心的敬意！
    但是，木材的需要是多多益善。上半年完成了计划，增加了产量，下半年还要继续增产。计算木材的产量，不只是砍倒了就算完成任务，还必须适时地从林区运出来。因此，各地党政领导机关和林业部门还必须继续抓紧木材的采伐和运输工作，动员广大林业职工和公社社员继续鼓足干劲，力争下半年更多增产。
    当前要抓紧解决哪些问题呢？就国营木材采伐企业来说，除了增加一些必需的器材、零件和生产设备，以增加企业的生产能力外，主要是加强企业的经营管理工作，提高劳动生产率。国营采伐企业是木材生产战线上的主要力量，它们生产的木材，占全国木材生产总量的三分之二左右。这些国营采伐企业，大部分集中在东北和内蒙古林区。这些林区虽然开发较早，有一些机械设备，但由于生产发展很快，生产能力的增长还不能满足生产发展的需要，生产的技术基础还很薄弱。这些采伐企业又大多分布在交通不便的山区，企业面积大而分散，作业线很长，流动性很大，所以长时期以来，有些采伐企业的经营管理工作还不能适应生产发展的要求。加之近几年来新工人不断增加，技术教育工作还没跟上去，也妨碍了劳动生产率的提高。有些企业在去年大跃进中打破了一些不合理的规章制度，但有些必要的和可行的制度也被废除了，而且破了以后又没有马上建立新的规章制度来代替。有些单位还取消了一些必要的职能机构和专业人员。这些问题，对生产都有一定的影响，必须在继续大搞群众运动的基础上，迅速地切实地改善经营管理工作，才能有效地提高生产。黑龙江省牡丹江林区的林业管理局，在增产节约运动中，及时部署、检查生产，组织各个企业进行评比，交流经验，健全了各种规章制度，特别是各项责任制度，采取以日保旬、以旬保月，狠狠地抓日班生产计划的措施以后，5月份的日产量平均比4月份提高50％，超额完成了月计划。牡丹江林区的经验很宝贵，它告诉我们，经营管理工作不但必须提高，而且可以很快提高，其关键在于党委和林业管理部门要抓起来。目前，为了更好地发挥现有机械设备的利用率，首先要加强机械的检修和保养工作，进一步提高操作技术，并要建立与健全各种规章制度。这是当前国营采伐企业提高木材运输能力的重要一环，也是增加木材生产的关键问题之一。
    我国的木材生产，一方面靠国营采伐企业；另一方面还要靠人民公社。搞好人民公社的木材生产，既能支援国家建设，也能增加公社的收入，有利于人民公社进一步发展生产。生产木材的人民公社主要在南方各省和自治区。今年人民公社所担负的木材生产任务十分繁重，各级党政领导必须认真的经常的帮助它们把这项生产任务抓起来。当前人民公社木材生产中最主要的问题就是劳动力不足和配备不当。人民公社木材生产的季节性很强，一季跟着一季，生产也是很紧张的。一般的规律是：秋冬采伐，春夏运输。木材采伐和运输是很繁杂而笨重的体力劳动，又要有一定的技术。根据这些生产特点，人民公社须要建立和健全木材生产专业组织（社、队办的伐木场或伐木队等），实行常年专业经营。临时抽调人员是不行的，因为临时抽调的人，业务不熟悉，生产效率很低，也很容易造成木材的损失浪费和人身伤亡事故。湖南省会同县今年的木材生产任务比去年增加了两倍多，就是因为固定了一支八千人的基本专业队伍，常年从事林业生产，到木材生产紧张的季节，又组织一批劳力进行协助，所以今年5月中旬，就基本上完成了今年的山场陆地短途运输任务。有了从事木材生产的专业队伍，不但可以大大提高劳动生产率，增加人民公社的收入，同时也节省了劳动力，有利于农业生产，使各项生产井然有序。在专业队伍组织起来以后，人民公社应当根据木材生产劳动强度大的特点，在工资和口粮方面给以适当的照顾，以鼓励从事木材生产的社员的积极性。
    为了完成今年人民公社的木材生产任务，当前必须抓紧木材运输工作。南方各省的木材生产，采伐后绝大部分要经过山场短途陆地运输，然后再利用山间小溪运下来。小溪水多、适合流送木材的季节，只有春夏两季。当前正是有利时机。如果在这个好水季节不把木材抢运下来，今年的木材生产计划就有落空的危险。因此，除有关部门应当尽力供应一些水运所必需的器材外，各人民公社应该妥善安排劳力，抓紧当前的有利季节，力争把木材全部送到大河边和公路旁，以便下一段利用大河流送或车辆运输。
    笨重的手工作业在我国的木材生产中仍然占着很大比重，因此，在木材生产部门中广泛地开展技术革新和技术革命运动更为重要。近年来，广大林业职工和社员群众，在党的领导下改进和创造了不少新的生产工具。在目前轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，应当进一步地开展技术革新和技术革命运动，并把主攻方向集中到生产最薄弱的环节上去。从全国来看，无论南方北方，当前木材生产最重要的一环是集材和运材。这个问题也是木材生产的特点所决定的。因为伐树并不太费功夫，木材生产的大部分劳力和物力都用在集材和运材这一道工序上。如果能使这一段生产过程实现半机械化或机械化，木材生产的劳动生产率就可以大大提高，劳动条件就可以大大改善。为了达到这个目的，除发动广大职工和社员群众大胆进行技术革新外，也要特别注意推广已有的行之有效的先进工具，先进操作方法和经验。
    加强木材调运工作，也是当前木材生产中的一个重要问题。各地在木材供应上要保证按材种、按计划供应，特别是要大力保证坑木的供应，支援煤炭企业完成生产任务。在保证重点供应的同时，也要照顾一般用材的供应，以便满足各项建设和人民生活的需要。
    完成今年的木材生产任务，除了需要林业职工和社员群众积极努力外，还需要铁道部门及时地合理地调配车辆；需要交通部门拨出一定数量的汽车、拖轮等运输工具，运输积压在公路边或贮木场的存材。商业部门要进一步加强对林区的物资供应工作。地方机械修配和零件制造等企业，也应尽力支援木材采运机械的修配等工作。
    增产节约是建设社会主义的根本方法。在大力增产木材的同时，必须大力节约木材，克服浪费。在节约木材方面，过去几年里做了很多工作，取得了很大成绩。但是，从伐木到加工和利用等各个环节中，节约的潜力仍然很大。例如伐根，国家规定为十到二十公分，而有的采伐企业的伐根却高达五十到六十公分。另外，在山场上占木材产量的12％左右的梢头、枝丫等，如果很好地利用起来，不仅可以提高木材利用率，也可以增加坑木的产量。至于一些使用单位在节约木材方面所取得的宝贵经验，也应该广泛推行。如煤炭工业、铁路等部门的木材回收利用，提高复用率，以及防腐的经验等等，都是很好的。目前我国的森林资源并不丰富，我们建设和生产所需要的木材量却越来越大。因此，我们应当十分珍惜每一立方公尺、每一立方公寸的木材，做到合理加工，物尽其用。
