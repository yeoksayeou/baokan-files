Hefei, June 1st (Report from our newspaper) The Shucha People's Commune Committee in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, has been paying attention to the lives of its members and strengthening sanitation work during the busy farming season, ensuring the health of its members during the summer harvest and achieving a 100% labor attendance rate.

Since the spring plowing season, the Shucha Commune Committee has held several meetings with brigade cadres to discuss and arrange the lives of commune members during the busy farming season, with a particular focus on the discussion and arrangement of cafeteria hygiene and other healthcare work. All 299 canteens in the commune, organized by production teams, have now established regulations to ensure meals are served on time. When farm work is intense, cooks proactively deliver meals to the fields to reduce the fatigue of commune members traveling back and forth. Many canteens also provide boiled water and hot water for foot washing in a timely manner. Some production teams have even established women's bathrooms based on their conditions, allowing female commune members to take hot baths after returning from work. With such thoughtful care, the commune members are even more motivated to work. The members of the Fangzhuang Production Team in the Luqi Production Brigade have launched a labor competition between "frontline" and "rearline" personnel. The cooks have pledged to serve meals on time, deliver meals, and provide tea promptly; to prepare hot water for foot washing every night, ensuring that commune members eat well, drink well, and rest well. The commune members have pledged to complete or even exceed the summer planting and harvesting tasks on time, while ensuring quality.

The commune health center also held a meeting on April 18th, dividing the work meticulously. Doctors were assigned to specific brigades, divided into zones of responsibility, and formed mobile teams to provide mobile medical services to various production teams. At the same time, seventy-two health workers with general hygiene and nursing knowledge were trained. Now, each production team has one to three health workers, and wherever a commune member gives birth, healthcare personnel are there to provide care. These health workers are involved in both production and sanitation work alongside the team. Doctors who go to the countryside for mobile medical services not only provide medical treatment and labor but also conduct health education, assist health workers in improving their medical skills, and inspect the hygiene of canteens.

The commune has adjusted and trained kindergarten teachers and nursery workers, enabling them to understand childcare methods and general hygiene knowledge, allowing female commune members with children to participate in production with peace of mind.

In order not to affect the rest time of commune members, the Commune Committee holds essential meetings during meal times or in the fields, ensuring that everyone has enough sleep.

    保证社员身强力壮
    舒茶公社农忙时期医疗卫生搞得好
    本报合肥1日电　安徽舒城县舒茶人民公社党委，在农忙时期注意社员生活，加强卫生工作，保证了社员在夏收活动中的身体健康，劳动出勤率达到100％。
    舒茶公社党委从春耕以来，召开了几次大队干部会议讨论和安排农忙期间的社员生活问题，特别抓紧了食堂卫生和其他保健工作的讨论和安排。全社以生产组为单位组成的二百九十九个食堂，目前都订出了制度，做到按时开饭，在农活紧张时，为了减少社员的往返劳累，炊事员主动将饭送到田头，许多食堂还做到了及时供应开水和洗脚的热水。有的生产队根据条件，以食堂为单位成立了妇女浴室，使女社员劳动回家后也可洗热水澡。社员们得到这种周到的照顾，干活的劲头更大了。鹿起生产队方庄生产组的社员们开展了“前、后方”人员的劳动竞赛。炊事员纷纷保证做到按时开饭送饭，及时送茶水；每晚烧好洗脚水，保证社员吃得好、喝得好、休息得好。社员保证要按时完成或提前完成夏插、夏收任务，并保证质量。
    公社卫生院在4月18日也召开了会议，细致地分了工。将医生分别固定到大队，划片包干，组成流动组，到各个生产队作巡回医疗。同时还训练了七十二名懂得一般卫生护理常识的保健员。现在各生产队都有一名至三名保健员，哪里有社员生产，哪里就有保健人员去护理。这些保健员都是一边跟队生产，一边进行卫生工作。下乡巡回医疗的医生，除了一边医疗一边劳动外，还进行卫生宣传、帮助保健员提高医疗业务和检查食堂卫生工作。
    公社调整训练了幼儿园教师、托儿所的保育员，使她们懂得了照看孩子的方法和一般的卫生常识，使有孩子的女社员安心参加生产。
    公社党委为了不影响社员的休息时间，将非开不可的会议放在吃饭时间或田头进行，保证大家有足够的睡眠时间。
