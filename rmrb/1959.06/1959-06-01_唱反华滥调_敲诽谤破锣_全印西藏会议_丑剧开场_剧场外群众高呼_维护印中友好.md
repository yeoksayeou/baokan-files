Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 31st. A farce directed by some leaders of the Indian Praja Socialist Party, the anti-China "All-India Tibet Conference," began in Calcutta on the evening of the 30th.

A group of Indian reactionaries who have been slandering China since the Tibetan rebellion rehashed their set of anti-China, anti-communist clichés that have long been condemned by fair world opinion at this conference. They vehemently stirred up trouble and clamored for interference in China's internal affairs.

Just as this so-called "All-India Tibet Conference" was being held, loud voices of justice rang out outside the venue. The masses participating in the large-scale march organized by the Communist Party of India and trade unions chanted: "Maintain Indo-Chinese Friendship!" "No Interference in China's Internal Affairs!" It was announced that a West Bengal conference would be held on the 31st at the Calcutta University College Hall to protest interference in China's internal affairs on the Tibetan issue and to call for strengthening Sino-Indian friendship.

A different voice was heard at the "All-India Tibet Conference." The chairman of the conference, former Praja Socialist Party leader Narayan, said in his speech that he demanded "unanimous public opinion strongly opposes China's aggression in Tibet and supports Tibetan independence." He demanded that India take the lead in submitting the "Tibetan issue" to the United Nations and that the Indian government consider new issues of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in light of recent developments in Tibet.

S. Ghosh, the West Bengal leader of the Praja Socialist Party, demanded in his speech that the Chinese army immediately withdraw from Tibet and that an "international committee" be established to "stipulate the form of government requested by the Tibetans." He demanded that the Tibetans be given "the right to self-determination."

Praja Socialist Party leader Kamat said that there was so-called "Communist China's tyranny" in Tibet. He said that the monasteries there had been destroyed. He falsely claimed that "China was the one who violated the 1951 agreement." He also said that Indian merchants in Yatung and Gyantse were "being persecuted."

D.P. Ghosh, chairman of the Indian People's League, said at the meeting that the Tibetan rebellion was a "national uprising."

The chairman of the conference's preparatory committee, a self-proclaimed "historian" named Majumdar, demanded "the right to self-determination" for the Tibetan rebels at the meeting.

While attacking China and the Communist Party of India, these people also attacked the Indian government and the ruling Congress Party. Narayan said in his speech that "India's agreeing to China's suzerainty over Tibet (?) was a wrong policy. It morally and legally approved China's annexation of Tibet, making it impossible for Asian and African public opinion to form an opinion on this issue."

Majumdar complained to a reporter from the British "Daily Telegraph" before the meeting that the Congress Party members who had once supported the conference received instructions from New Delhi headquarters between the end of April and May 3rd, ordering them to withdraw from the preparatory committee.

A Tibetan rebel named Sonam Gyatso (transliteration) spoke at the meeting, who was introduced as one of the Dalai Lama's followers in Mussoorie. The English translation of his speech was pre-printed and read by K.K. Sinha, a leader of the so-called "Asian Foundation for Cultural Freedom," which is supported by Americans. This English translation used the same language as other speakers, describing the Tibetan incident as a "national uprising," demanding "complete independence" for Tibet, and demanding that an "impartial committee" be sent to Tibet to "ascertain the truth."

    唱反华滥调　敲诽谤破锣
    “全印西藏会议”丑剧开场
    剧场外群众高呼“维护印中友好”
    新华社新德里31日电　加尔各答消息：由印度人民社会党的一些领导人导演的一幕反对中国的丑剧“全印西藏会议”30日晚间在加尔各答开始上演。
    一批从西藏叛乱事件开始以来一直诬蔑中国的印度反动分子，在这次会议上重弹了他们那套早已被世界公正舆论谴责了的反华反共滥调。他们一股劲地煽风点火，并叫嚷要干涉中国内政。
    就在这个所谓“全印西藏会议”开会时，会场外响起了洪亮的正义的声音。参加由印度共产党和工会组织的大规模游行的群众高呼：“维护印中友好！”“不许干涉中国内政！”据宣布，在31日将在加尔各答大学学院大厅召开西孟加拉邦会议，以便抗议在西藏问题上对中国内政的干涉。并且号召加强印中友谊。
    在“全印西藏会议”上发出的却是另一种声音。会议主席、前人民社会党领袖纳拉扬在发言中要求“舆论一致强烈地反对中国侵略西藏和支持西藏独立”。他要求印度带头把“西藏问题”提交联合国，并且要求印度政府根据西藏最近发生的情况来考虑和平共处五项原则的新问题。
    人民社会党西孟加拉邦领导人萨·高希在发言中要求中国军队立即撤出西藏，成立一个什么“国际委员会”，来“规定西藏人所要求的政府形式”。他要求给予西藏人以“自决权”。
    人民社会党领袖卡马特说，西藏境内有着所谓“共产党中国的暴政”。他说，那里的寺院已经被毁坏。他污蔑说，“破坏1951年协议的是中国”。他又说，在亚东和江孜的印度商人在“受到折磨”。
    印度人民同盟主席德·普·高希在会上说西藏叛乱是“民族起义”。
    会议筹备委员会的主席、号称“历史学家”的马朱达在会上替西藏叛乱分子要求“自决权”。
    这些人在攻击中国和印度共产党的同时，也攻击了印度政府和执政党国大党。纳拉扬在他的讲话中说，“印度同意中国在西藏的宗主地位（？）是一种错误的政策。它使中国并吞西藏的行动在道义上和法律上得到批准，使得亚非舆论不能在这个问题上形成一种意见。”
    马朱达在会前向英国“每日电讯报”记者抱怨说，一度支持会议的国大党人在4月底和5月3日之间接到了新德里总部的一份指示，命令他们退出筹备委员会。
    在会上有一个叫作索南嘉措（译音）的西藏叛匪讲了话，他被介绍为达赖喇嘛在穆索里的随从者之一。他的讲话的英文译稿是事先印好的，由美国人支持的一个所谓“亚洲文化自由协会”的一名领导人克·克·辛哈宣读。这份英文译稿上使用了同其他发言者一样的语言，把西藏事件说成是“民族起义”，要求西藏“完全独立”，并且要求派一个“公正的委员会”去西藏“辨明真象”。
