Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th. The "Friendship Railway" section from Aktogay to the Sino-Soviet border is scheduled to officially open for passenger train service on July 1st; freight transport has already commenced.

On June 23rd, the track-laying workers laid the last set of rails on the Sino-Soviet border line, where a steel arch stands, inscribed with "The Road of Eternal Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet Peoples." This arch was erected three years ago by Chinese and Soviet surveyors. According to tradition, a mass rally was held during the laying of the final set of rails. Advanced construction workers and guests, amidst the jubilant cheers of the crowd, hammered the last four spikes into the sleepers. This marked the complete construction of this section of the railway. Now, the Soviet railway workers are waiting for their Chinese brothers to extend the railway to meet them here.

Construction of this section of the railway, from commencement to completion, took less than three years, and was carried out under extremely harsh natural conditions. After the rails are laid, the workers will begin constructing a large internal combustion locomotive depot, three power stations, nine stations, and many houses.

    “友谊铁路”修到中苏国境
    阿克斗卡到中苏国境段定七月一日通客车
    新华社莫斯科28日电　“友谊铁路”从阿克斗卡到中苏国境段定7月1日正式通客车，货运已经开始。
    6月23日，铺路工人将最后一组铁轨铺到中苏国境线上，这里耸立着一座铁制的拱门，上面写着“中苏人民永恒友谊之路”，这是三年前中苏勘探人员建立的拱门。按照传统，在铺最后的一组铁轨时举行了群众大会。由筑路的先进工人和来宾在群众的胜利欢呼声中将最后的四颗道钉钉在枕木上面。这标志着这一段路已经全部修成了。现在苏联的铁路工人们正等待中国兄弟将路修到这里。
    这段路动工到现在不到三年，筑路是在极其恶劣的自然条件下进行的。路轨铺成后工人们将开始修建一个大内燃机车车库、三个电站、九个车站以及许多房屋。
