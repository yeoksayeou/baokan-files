    Xinhua News Agency Report: Yongxing County, Hunan Province, while focusing on the management of paddy fields, is also stepping up the reclamation and cultivation of oil-tea trees, striving for a bumper harvest of tea oil. By the beginning of June, the county had reclaimed and cultivated more than 170,000 mu of oil-tea forests.
    Yongxing is one of the famous oil-tea producing areas in Hunan, with more than 580,000 mu of oil-tea forests in the county. After the completion of early and mid-season rice transplanting, the county party committee rationally arranged the labor force for reclaiming oil-tea forests, organized professional teams and groups, and universally implemented the "four-fixed" production responsibility system within the professional teams and groups, which meant fixed location, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed work points.
