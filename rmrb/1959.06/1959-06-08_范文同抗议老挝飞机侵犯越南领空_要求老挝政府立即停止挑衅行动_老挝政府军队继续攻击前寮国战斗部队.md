    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th -- Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a telegram to the Government of the Kingdom of Laos on June 6th, protesting the intrusion of reconnaissance aircraft of the Lao Royal Army into the airspace of the Meng Seng area in the western part of Nghe An Province (formerly translated as Yi'an Province) of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at 6:30 AM on June 3rd and 10:00 AM on June 4th. Pham Van Dong's telegram was released today by the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
    The telegram stated that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protested the above-mentioned actions of the Government of the Kingdom of Laos and demanded that the Government of the Kingdom of Laos immediately cease such provocative behavior. The telegram stated: "The Government of the Kingdom of Laos must bear full responsibility for the consequences arising from the provocative incidents it has created."
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th -- According to Vietnam News Agency reports, at 3:05 PM on June 5th, a reconnaissance aircraft of the Kingdom of Laos again intruded into the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the Meng Seng area of western Nghe An Province in central North Vietnam.
    This is the third time in three days that military aircraft of the Kingdom of Laos have intruded into the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The Vietnam News Agency is authorized to once again protest this serious incident and demand that the Phoui Sananikone government cease such serious provocative behavior.
    The Vietnam News Agency stated that Vietnamese border defense forces and public security forces have been ordered to continue strengthening border defense work.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th -- According to reports in local newspapers today, Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote a letter to Ansaray, Chairman of the International Commission of Vietnam, on June 4th, strongly protesting the increasingly close military collusion between the South Vietnamese authorities and the Lao government.
    Ha Van Lau cited reports from South Vietnamese newspapers and foreign news agencies to illustrate that the South Vietnamese authorities and a delegation from the Kingdom of Laos government, headed by Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya, had already decided on May 24th in Saigon to conclude agreements on a number of noteworthy issues, including "border regulations," "judicial cooperation," "cooperation in security and military forces," and "transportation routes to Laos via the two ports of Saigon and Tourane."
    Ha Van Lau pointed out that since last year, high-ranking military personnel from both South Vietnam and Laos have been constantly traveling back and forth. Ha Van Lau cited many specific examples of such exchanges and emphasized that the South Vietnamese authorities, at the instigation of the United States, have sent many plainclothes soldiers to Laos, using Laos as a base for espionage and sabotage activities against the border areas of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The pro-American Lao government is vigorously supporting and participating in the above-mentioned sabotage activities.
    Ha Van Lau said that the South Vietnamese authorities and the Lao government, according to the US military aggression plan in Southeast Asia, openly recognize the "protection" of the Southeast Asia military group headed by US imperialism.
    He pointed out that the strategic highway network connecting South Vietnam through Laos with Thailand, a member of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, is being rapidly expanded.
    Ha Van Lau said that the Lao Foreign Minister publicly announced in Saigon on May 21st that Laos was prepared to rely on the Southeast Asia military group and "strongly anti-communist" countries.
    Ha Van Lau emphasized that the above facts fully demonstrate that South Vietnamese authorities and the Lao government have colluded militarily according to a common plan. This is a blatant and serious violation of the Geneva Accords. It will make the situation in Indochina even more tense. Peace in this region is facing an extremely serious threat.
    Ha Van Lau requested the International Commission to take resolute measures in a timely manner to prevent the South Vietnamese authorities and the Government of the Kingdom of Laos from realizing the aforementioned military alliance.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th -- According to local newspaper reports, according to news from the Vietnam-Laos border, in recent days, the Government of the Kingdom of Laos has continued to dispatch troops to attack the Second Battalion of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces, attempting to eliminate it.
    The news stated that on June 5th, fighting broke out again in the eastern mountainous areas of Xiangkhouang Province, and gunshots could be heard in the Vietnamese border area.

    范文同抗议老挝飞机侵犯越南领空
    要求老挝政府立即停止挑衅行动
    老挝政府军队继续攻击前寮国战斗部队
    新华社河内7日电　越南民主共和国政府范文同总理6日打电报给老挝王国政府，抗议老挝王国军队的侦察机在6月3日上午六时三十分和6月4日上午十时侵犯越南民主共和国宜安省（前译义安省）西部孟生地区的领空。范文同的电报是越南外交部在今天公布的。
    电报说，越南民主共和国政府强烈抗议老挝王国政府的上述行动，并要求老挝王国政府立即停止这种挑衅行为。电报说：“老挝王国政府必须对它制造的挑衅事件所产生的后果负完全责任”。
    新华社河内7日电　据越南通讯社报道，6月5日下午三时五分老挝王国的一架侦察机又侵入北越中部宜安省西部孟生地区的越南民主共和国领空。
    这是三天来老挝王国军用飞机第三次侵犯越南民主共和国领空。
    越南通讯社受权再一次对此严重事件提出抗议，并要求培·萨纳尼空政府停止这种严重的挑衅行为。
    越南通讯社说，越南边防部队和公安部队已经奉令继续加强对边界的保卫工作。
    新华社河内7日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校6月4日写信给越南国际委员会主席安沙里，强烈地抗议南越当局同老挝政府正在进行更紧密的军事勾结。
    何文楼援引南越报纸和外国新闻机关报道的消息，说明南越当局同以外交大臣坎番·班雅为首的老挝王国政府代表团，已经在5月24日在西贡决定就许多值得注意的问题缔结协定，其中包括“边界规章”、“司法合作”、“保安和军事力量的合作”和“经西贡和土伦两个港口到老挝的运输线”等问题。
    何文楼指出，从去年以来，南越和老挝双方的高级军事人员就不断地你来我往。何文楼举出了这种来往的许多具体事例之后强调指出，南越当局在美国唆使下派了许多便衣军人到老挝，利用老挝作为向越南民主共和国边界地带进行间谍和破坏活动的基地。而亲美的老挝政府正在大力支持并同他们一起进行上述的破坏活动。
    何文楼说，南越当局和老挝政府根据美国在东南亚的军事侵略计划，公然承认以美帝国主义为首的东南亚军事集团的“保护”。
    他指出，把南越通过老挝同东南亚侵略集团成员国泰国的战略公路连接起来的战略公路网正在加紧扩建中。
    何文楼说，老挝外交大臣5月21日曾经在西贡公然宣布，老挝准备依靠东南亚军事集团和“强烈反共”的国家。
    何文楼强调指出，上述事实充分证明了南越当局同老挝政府之间已经根据共同计划在军事方面勾结起来。这是对日内瓦协议的明目张胆的严重违犯。它将使印度支那的局势变得更加紧张。这个地区的和平正在受到异常严重的威胁。
    何文楼要求国际委员会及时采取坚决措施，不许南越当局同老挝王国政府实现上述的军事联盟。
    新华社河内7日电　据此间报纸报道，根据来自越南—老挝边境的消息，几天来，老挝王国政府继续出动军队进攻前寮国战斗部队的第二营，企图消灭它。
    消息说，6月5日，双方又在川圹的东部山区发生战斗，在越南边界地区，可以听到枪声。
