Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: The Ministry of Education, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the State Council Personnel Bureau recently jointly issued a notice requiring education administrative departments, Communist Youth League organizations, and personnel departments of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, under the unified leadership of local Party committees, to promptly strengthen the ideological education of this year's college graduates during the summer vacation. The notice also requires all colleges and universities to list the ideological education of graduates as one of the school's important tasks.

The notice pointed out: This summer, the total number of college graduates nationwide is more than 60,000, which is far from meeting the actual needs of the rapidly developing socialist construction cause. At the same time, the distribution of graduates' majors and numbers is still uneven across regions, and the graduates of some majors may need to be appropriately adjusted regionally. In addition, due to the rapid development of the construction cause, the plan for training cadres is difficult to be completely accurate. The supply of graduates in some majors falls short of demand, while some majors have no graduates but are urgently needed by the state. Therefore, the distribution of this year's graduates must still adhere to the principle of aligning learning with application based on national needs. In light of these circumstances, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of graduates in a timely manner so that they understand the needs of the country and the actual difficulties of the distribution work, and can consciously and happily obey the assignment of the state.

Targeting the ideological situation of this year's college graduates during the summer vacation and the needs of the country, the notice proposes the following points for ideological education:

One, this year's college graduates are being assigned according to the 1959 National Economic Construction Plan and the spirit of the national unified plan. Therefore, graduates should correctly understand the needs of the country and happily obey the assignment of the state. They should not only happily obey the assignment at school, but also resolutely obey the assignment after arriving at the work units. Only in this way can they adapt to the country's need for specialized talents and strive to dedicate themselves to the socialist construction of the motherland.

Two, young people have personal aspirations and are full of ideals, which should be encouraged. The ideals and aspirations of the majority of graduates are to better utilize their talents for the construction of the motherland, and the state should provide as much care as possible. However, graduates are assigned according to the needs of national construction in a planned way, and it is actually difficult to fully take care of the wishes of each graduate. Therefore, graduates should be made aware of the principle that personal wishes and interests must obey the needs of the country, and they should be educated to establish a holistic concept.

Three, the work of assigning graduates over the years has been carried out based on meeting national needs and implementing the principle of aligning learning with application, and the work assigned to the vast majority of graduates aligns with their studies. However, the issue of aligning learning with application is more complex, and graduates should be informed of the overall situation, clarifying what is meant by aligning learning with application and the possible problems that may arise in implementing aligning learning with application, preventing absolutism, and enabling graduates to correctly treat the issue of aligning learning with application based on national needs.

Four, the actual difficulties of graduates should be given appropriate consideration as much as possible on the basis of obeying the needs of the state. If it is not possible to take care of them, the reasons should be explained clearly. For the few graduates who are greedy for enjoyment and afraid of hardship, appropriate education should be carried out to enable them to happily obey the assignment.

Five, after the graduates are assigned to work, they become state cadres. In the future, in their work posts, they should actively work hard, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, resolutely obey the leadership of the Party, respond to the call of the Party, and constantly carry out self-transformation; they should be humble and not arrogant; in their work, they should work hard to study their professions and constantly strive to improve their professional level; they should go to factories and rural areas to participate in physical labor and do grassroots work, enrich their knowledge of production and class struggle, and actively strive to become intellectuals who are both red and expert.

The notice pointed out that conducting ideological education for graduates is a meticulous and complex task. To do this work well, graduates must be allowed to fully express their personal opinions and dispel all concerns.

    加强对应届高等学校毕业生的思想教育工作
    讲明国家需要　自觉服从分配
    教育部、团中央和国务院人事局联合发出通知
    新华社15日讯　教育部、共青团中央、国务院人事局最近联合发出通知，要求各省、市、自治区教育行政部门、共青团组织、人事部门等，在当地党委统一领导下，及时加强今年暑假高等学校毕业生的思想教育工作，并要求各高等学校将毕业生的思想教育工作列为学校重要工作之一。
    通知指出：今年暑假全国高等学校毕业生总数为六万多人，远不能满足迅速发展着的社会主义建设事业的实际需要。同时，今年毕业生的专业和人数，在地区间的分布情况仍不平衡，有些专业的毕业生在地区上可能要作适当的调整。再加培养干部的计划，由于建设事业的迅速发展，很难完全准确，有些专业的毕业生供不应求，有些专业没有毕业生而国家又迫切需要，因而今年毕业生的分配，仍须在国家需要的基础上贯彻学用一致的原则。根据这些情况，有必要及时加强毕业生的思想教育，使他们了解国家的需要和分配工作的实际困难，而能自觉、愉快地服从国家的分配。
    通知针对今年暑期高等学校毕业生的思想情况和国家的需要，提出以下几点思想教育的内容：
    一、今年高等学校毕业生是根据1959年国民经济建设计划和全国一盘棋的精神进行分配的。因此，毕业生应该正确地认识国家的需要，愉快地服从国家的分配。不仅在学校时愉快服从分配，而且到工作部门后，同样要坚决服从分配。这样才能适应国家对专门人才的需要，努力献身于祖国社会主义建设事业。
    二、青年人有个人的抱负，富于理想，是应当鼓励的。大多数毕业生的理想、志愿，是希望更好地为祖国的建设事业发挥自己的才能，国家应该尽可能地给予照顾。但是，毕业生是按国家建设需要有计划地分配的，要完全照顾每个毕业生的志愿，事实上是有困难的。因此，应向毕业生讲清楚个人的志愿、兴趣必须服从国家需要的道理，教育他们树立整体观念。
    三、历年来分配毕业生工作，是在适应国家需要的基础上，贯彻学用一致的原则进行的，而且绝大部分毕业生分配的工作是学用一致的。但贯彻学用一致的问题比较复杂，应当使毕业生了解全面情况，把什么叫学用一致，和贯彻学用一致方面可能产生的问题，向毕业生交代清楚，防止绝对化，使毕业生能够根据国家的需要，正确地对待学用一致的问题。
    四、对毕业生的实际困难，应当在服从国家需要的基础上，尽可能给予适当的照顾。不可能照顾的，就应讲清道理。对少数贪图享受、害怕艰苦的毕业生，应向他们进行适当的教育，使他们能够愉快地服从分配。
    五、毕业生分配工作后，就成为国家干部。今后在工作岗位上，应当积极努力工作，认真学习马列主义，坚决服从党的领导，响应党的号召，经常进行自我改造；要谦虚，不要自高自大；在工作中要刻苦钻研业务，不断努力提高业务水平；到工厂、农村去参加体力劳动，做基层工作，丰富生产和阶级斗争的知识，积极争取做一个又红又专的知识分子。
    通知指出，对毕业生进行思想教育，是一项细致、复杂的工作。要做好这一工作，必须让毕业生充分表达个人意见，解除一切顾虑。
