    As the imbalance of economic development in the capitalist world intensifies and the struggle for markets becomes more fierce, the United States' economic position in the capitalist world is facing increasingly serious challenges.
    According to a report in the May 18th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, the export volume of American industrial products continued to plummet in the first quarter of this year: steel products decreased by 47%, railway transportation equipment by 38%, tires by 23%, aircraft and parts by 23%, new automobiles by 18%, construction, excavation, and mining machinery by 16%, cotton cloth by 11%, and gasoline and lubricating oil by 8.5%. Although Britain and France have successively removed restrictions on the import of most American industrial machinery since last September, the export volume of American industrial products to Britain and France has tended to decline. However, in the first quarter of this year, exports of industrial products from Western European countries, especially their exports to the United States, increased. British automobile exports to the United States alone increased by 50% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. As a result, in Sino-British trade, for the first time since 1865, Britain had a trade surplus with the United States.
    The weakening of the competitiveness of American industrial products in the capitalist world market was already clearly exposed in mid-1957 when capitalist world trade began to shrink. From the first half of 1957 to the second half of 1958, American industrial product exports decreased by 10%, but in the same period, West German industrial product exports increased by 14%, Japan increased by 6%, and exports from Italy and the Netherlands also increased. As a result, the proportion of American industrial product exports in the world's total industrial product exports fell from 26% in the first half of 1957 to 23.2% at the end of 1958, while West Germany increased from 17% to 19%.
    The fierce competition encountered in selling goods abroad has caused panic among American businesses. Joseph Cordiner, chairman of General Electric, recently exclaimed: "Japan has taken away 50% of our small radio business."
    A March bulletin from the First National City Bank of New York also lamented that American steel exports in 1958 had fallen 40% compared to 1957, and automobile exports had fallen from third place to fifth, behind West Germany, Britain, France, and Italy.
    This reversal in American foreign trade cannot but seriously affect its international balance of payments, thereby greatly shaking the credit of the dollar. In 1957, the United States had a surplus of 500 million U.S. dollars in its international balance of payments. In 1958, due to the deterioration of trade, a deficit of 3.3 billion U.S. dollars appeared. Among these 3.3 billion U.S. dollars of deficit, 2.3 billion U.S. dollars were paid for by outflowing gold. This resulted in the largest gold outflow in American history.
    Since the beginning of this year, the state of American foreign trade has not improved, and the outflow of gold from the United States is still intensifying. Rumors about the instability of the dollar are spreading in the capitalist world. From April 1st to May 15th alone, the outflow of gold from the United States reached 252.2 million U.S. dollars. At the same time, the exchange rate of the dollar against gold and the pound sterling in the Western European market is also falling steadily. This cannot but shake the position of the United States as the financial center of the capitalist world.
    In contrast to the large outflow of gold from the United States and the instability of the dollar's credit, the gold reserves of Western European countries, which are competitors of the United States, are rising. France, which has always been known as a "bankrupt" for living on debt, has seen a rare miracle of rising reserves since the beginning of this year. In the first quarter of this year, Britain not only increased its gold reserves by 25 million pounds (equivalent to 70 million U.S. dollars), but also paid off 98 million pounds of debt at the same time, greatly improving London's credit standing.
    This decline in the United States' economic position in the capitalist world is obviously related to the fact that its economic growth rate has lagged far behind that of its Western European allies since 1950. For example, from 1950 to 1955, industrial production in Western European countries (excluding Britain) increased by 45%, while the United States only increased by 22%; from 1955 to 1957, Western European industrial production increased by 14.4%, while the United States only increased by 2.8%. The United States also lagged behind Western Europe in terms of the growth rate of gross national product. For example, in the five years from 1953 to 1957, the gross national product of Western European countries increased by 40%, while the United States only increased by 27% in the same period.
    On May 22nd of this year, the U.S. National Industrial Conference Board also pointed out: "The United States is losing its dominant position in the industrial life of the Western world." The committee said that the proportion of American industrial production in the production of the non-communist world has fallen from 56.2% in 1948 to 46.6% in 1958, and the percentage of exports is also far lower than in 1948.
    In the context of the shrinking capitalist world market, this relative strengthening of the economic strength of Western European countries will undoubtedly intensify the battle for markets, thereby exacerbating the contradictions between imperialists.

### 资本主义世界经济竞争激烈   美国好景不常面临严重挑战  工业产品出口锐减　国际收支入不敷出　黄金外流日益加剧

    资本主义世界经济竞争激烈
    美国好景不常面临严重挑战
    工业产品出口锐减　国际收支入不敷出　黄金外流日益加剧
    本报讯　随着资本主义世界经济发展不平衡的加剧和争夺市场斗争的激烈化，美国在资本主义世界的经济地位，正受到越来越严重的挑战。
    根据5月18日“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志的消息，今年第一季度美国工业品出口额继续狂跌：钢铁制品减少了47％，铁路运输装备减少了38％，轮胎减少23％，飞机和零件减少23％，新汽车减少18％，建筑、开凿和采矿机器减少16％，棉布减少11％，汽油和滑润油减少8.5％。尽管去年9月以来，英国和法国已先后取消了对美国大部分工业机器进口的限额，可是美国对英、法的工业品输出额反而趋于下降。但是在今年第一季内，西欧国家工业品的出口，特别是它们对美国的出口却在增加。仅是英国对美国的汽车出口在今年第一季就比去年同期增加了50％。结果在美英贸易中出现了1865年以来第一次英国对美国贸易的出超。
    美国工业品在资本主义世界市场上竞争能力的削弱，早在1957年年中资本主义世界贸易开始萎缩的时候，就已明显的暴露出来。从1957年上半年到1958年下半年，美国工业品输出下降了10％，但在同时期西德工业品出口却增加了14％，日本增加了6％，意大利和荷兰的输出也有增加。结果是美国在世界工业品输出份额中所占的比重从1957年上半年的26％下降到1958年底的23.2％，而西德则从17％增加到19％。
    在国外销售货物方面所遇到的强烈竞争，引起了美国企业界的惊惶不安。美国“通用电气公司”董事长柯迪纳最近就叫嚷说：“我们50％的小型收音机买卖给日本夺取了。”
    美国“纽约第一花旗银行”3月份的通报也在哀叹。美国1958年的钢出口已比1957年下跌40％，汽车出口已由第三位降为第五位而退居于西德、英国、法国和意大利的后面。
    美国在对外贸易上的这种逆转，当然不能不严重影响它的国际收支，从而大大动摇它的美元的信用。1957年美国的国际收支曾有五亿美元的顺差。1958年由于贸易的恶化，却出现了三十三亿美元的逆差。在这三十三亿美元的逆差中，就有二十三亿美元是用流出黄金来支付的。结果造成了美国历史上最大的一次黄金外流。
    今年以来，美国对外贸易情况仍无起色，美国的黄金外流仍在日益加剧，资本主义世界风传美元不稳。仅是从4月1日到5月15日美国外流黄金就达二亿五千二百万美元。同时在西欧市场上美元对黄金和英镑的比价亦在节节下跌。这样就不能不使作为资本主义世界金融中心的美国地位发生动摇。
    与美国黄金大量外流、美元信用呈现不稳相反，作为美国竞争对手的西欧各国的黄金储备却在上升。一向以借债度日号称是“破落户”的法国，今年以来储备情况出现了罕有的上升奇迹。英国在今年第一季不仅使它的黄金储备增加了两千五百万英镑（合七千万美元），而且还同时付清了九千八百万英镑的债务，使伦敦的信用地位，大大获得提高。
    美国在资本主义世界经济地位的这一下降，显然是同1950年以来它的经济发展速度大大落后于它的西欧盟国有关。例如从1950年到1955年西欧（除英国以外）国家的工业生产增加了45％，美国只增加了22％；从1955年到1957年，西欧工业生产增长了14.4％，而美国只增加了2.8％。美国在国民生产总值的增长速度方面，也同样落后于西欧。例如在从1953年到1957年的五年中，西欧国家的国民生产总值增加了40％，在同时期内，美国只增加了27％。
    今年5月22日美国全国工业会议委员会也指出：“美国在西方世界的工业生活中，正失去它的优势地位”。这个委员会说，美国工业生产在非共产主义世界的生产中所占部分已从1948年的56.2％降为1958年的46.6％，输出方面所占的百分比也远远低于1948年。
    在资本主义世界市场日益萎缩的情况下，西欧国家经济实力的这种相对增强无疑将会加剧市场的争夺战，从而加剧帝国主义之间的矛盾。
