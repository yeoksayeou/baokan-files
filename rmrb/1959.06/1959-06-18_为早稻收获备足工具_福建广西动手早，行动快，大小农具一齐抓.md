Prepare Sufficient Tools for Early Rice Harvest
　　Fujian and Guangxi Start Early, Act Quickly, Grasping Both Large and Small Farm Tools

　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou Electric Dispatch: A farm tool manufacturing and repair movement centered on preparing sufficient tools for the summer harvest and planting has unfolded across Fujian Province.

　　Fujian Province transplanted rice early this year, and the summer harvest will also be earlier than in previous years. In earlier areas, the harvest will begin in about a month.

　　In order to prepare for the summer harvest tools as soon as possible, many areas summarized the experience of vigorously carrying out tool reforms in spring plowing production as early as April, and deployed the manufacturing and repair work of summer harvest and planting tools. After the spring plowing, Liancheng, Changle, Youxi, Dongshan and other counties sent cadres to go deep into the communes and production teams to solicit opinions, understand the storage and needs of large and small farm tools in rural areas this year, and help various places to formulate repair and manufacturing plans, and organize the surplus and deficiency adjustment of raw materials and finished products. With the assistance of the commercial sector, Youxi County established 117 farm tool repair factories (stations), and adopted a combination of fixed-point production and door-to-door repair methods, and has manufactured and repaired more than 150,000 farm tools.

　　In addition, Xinhua News Agency reports: Farm tool manufacturing workers in various parts of Fujian have generally improved their operating techniques in order to accelerate the manufacturing of summer harvest tools.

　　The ironworking team of Shefeng Farm Tool Factory in Changle County adopted the operating methods of "fierce fire, tight hammering, and stable hammering," which increased the daily production of scythes from 40 to 85, and the quality was also very good. The Farm Tool Factory of Fengting Commune in Xianyou County put forward the slogan of "Let waste materials and old materials serve the summer harvest," and cleaned up more than 150 dan of waste iron from the warehouse, processed them into more than 6,800 scythes and more than 5,700 various plowshares and plow walls. Xiapu County adopted the method of recycling waste products and renovating old ones, and repaired more than 37,000 various iron farm tools.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning Electric Dispatch: As the early rice harvest season is approaching, various parts of Guangxi are actively rushing to manufacture summer harvest and planting farm tools. According to incomplete statistics from Yulin, Nanning, Liuzhou, and Baise four districts, about 1.5 million large and small farm tools have been manufactured, and these farm tools are being rapidly transported to the countryside.

　　This year, the production of summer harvest and planting farm tools in various parts of Guangxi started early, acted quickly, and grasped both large and small, new and old; and paid attention to improving quality. As early as late April, the Industry Department of the Liuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China made specific arrangements. Many counties and communes have organized professional production teams for iron, wood, and bamboo farm tools; production brigades and production teams have also established farm tool repair stations and processing groups. County and commune farm tool factories are responsible for producing large farm tools such as threshers, harvesters, plows, and harrows, and brigade and team repair stations (groups) are responsible for producing small farm tools and repairing old farm tools, with clear division of labor and mutual cooperation.

　　In the Baise Special Zone, where various ethnic groups live together, the opinions of farmers of all ethnic groups were fully solicited in the production of farm tools, and they tried their best to adapt to their special operating habits, and made appropriate modifications to some stereotyped farm tools to achieve diversification of specifications and types.

    为早稻收获备足工具
    福建广西动手早，行动快，大小农具一齐抓
    据新华社福州电　一个以备足夏收夏种工具为中心的农具制造、修配运动，已在福建全省各地展开。
    福建省今年插秧早，夏收也将比往年提前，较早的地区，再有一月左右即将开镰收割。
    为了及早准备好夏收工具，不少地区早在4月间就通过总结春耕生产中大搞工具改革的经验，部署了夏收夏种工具的制造、修配工作。连城、长乐、尤溪、东山等县在春耕结束后，就派出干部深入公社和生产队，征求意见，了解今年农村大小农具的储存和需要情况，帮助各地订出修配、制造计划，组织原料材料和成品的余缺调剂。尤溪县在商业部门的协助下，建立了一百一十七个农具修配厂（站），采取定点生产与登门修补相结合的办法，已经制造和修配农具十五万多件。
    又讯　福建各地农具制造工人为加速制造夏收工具，普遍改进操作技术。
    长乐县舍峰农具厂铁工小组采用“火猛、锤紧、锤稳”的操作方法，使每天制造镰刀的数量由四十把提高到八十五把，质量也很好。仙游县枫亭公社农具厂提出“让废料、旧料为夏收服务”的口号，从仓库中清理出废旧铁一百五十多担，加工成镰刀六千八百多把和各种犁头、犁壁五千七百多件。霞浦县采取废品回炉和以旧翻新的办法，修配了各种铁器农具三万七千多件。
    据新华社南宁电　早稻收获季节即将到来，广西各地积极赶制夏收夏种农具。据玉林、南宁、柳州、百色等四个专区不完全统计，已经制造出大小农具一百五十万件左右，这些农具正在迅速运往乡村。
    今年，广西各地夏收夏种农具的生产动手早、行动快，大小新旧一齐抓；并且注意提高质量。早在4月下旬，中共柳州地委工业部就作了具体安排。许多县和公社都组织了铁、木、竹器农具专业生产队；各生产大队、生产队也建立了农具修配站和加工组。县、社农具厂负责生产打谷机、收割机、犁、耙等大型农具，大队小队修配站（组）负责生产小农具和修理旧农具，明确分工，相互配合。
    民族杂居的百色专区，在农具生产中充分征求各族农民的意见，尽量适应他们的特殊操作习惯，对部分定型农具作了适当的修改，做到规格类型多样化。
