Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Electric Dispatch: Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, pays attention to developing sheep raising in the plains. Now there are more than 79,000 sheep in the plains area, averaging 2.8 sheep per household. Although this area is close to Lanzhou City and has a large task of supporting the city every year, and farmers themselves slaughter and eliminate a lot, the number of sheep is still increasing year by year. Compared with 1953, the number of sheep has increased by more than 50% net.

The method of developing sheep raising in the plains area of Yuzhong County is to divide into small groups for raising, with each production team raising one or two groups, each group having ten to thirty sheep, and at most fifty or more. Because the sheep groups are small, they can be managed by old men or semi-laborers. The sheep are grazed in places with grass such as next to villages, roadsides, riverbanks, ditch sides, and cemeteries. When grazing is not enough to feed them, the weeds hoeed from the fields or the harvested alfalfa are used as supplementary feed. In addition to normal grazing every winter, tree leaves, legume leaves, and silage corn stalks accumulated in summer and autumn are used for feeding. Because the sheep groups are small, the fodder for large livestock will not be affected.

There are many benefits of raising sheep in the plains. It can not only supply meat to nearby cities, but also increase a large amount of high-quality fertilizer. In 1958, the manure accumulated by sheep in the Yuzhong plains area was more than 100 million catties. In addition, the income from sheepskins and wool is also very large. Last year, the farmers in the Yuzhong County plains area earned more than 200,000 yuan from wool alone.

This year, the people's communes in the Yuzhong County plains area have attached greater importance to sheep raising, and have purchased 120 Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, preparing to gradually improve the local coarse-wool sheep breeds into fine-wool sheep to improve wool quality.

    小群饲养　省工省料
    榆中县羊只年年增加
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃榆中县注意在平川地区发展养羊事业。现在川区有羊七万九千多只，平均每户二点八只。虽然这里紧靠兰州市，历年支援城市的任务较大，农民自己宰杀淘汰的也较多，但羊只还是一年比一年增加。现在和1953年比较，羊只净增50％以上。
    榆中县在平川地区发展养羊的办法，是以生产队为单位，分小群饲养，每个生产队养一两群，每群十只到三十只，最多五十多只。因为羊群小，可以由老汉或半劳动力管理。羊群就在村旁、路边、河畔、渠边、坟地等有草的地方放牧。放牧还不能吃饱时，就利用田间锄的草或收的苜蓿来补饲。每年冬季除了照常放牧以外，还用夏秋季节积下的树叶、豆科植物叶子和青贮的玉米秆等喂养。因为羊群小，大牲畜的饲草不会受到影响。
    川区养羊好处很多。不仅能以肉食供应附近城市，还能增加大量优质肥料。1958年，榆中川区羊只积下的肥料有一亿多斤。另外羊的皮毛收入也很大。去年榆中县川区农民仅羊毛一项即收入二十多万元。
    今年，榆中县川区各人民公社更加重视养羊，已经买了一百二十只新疆细毛羊，准备把这里的粗毛羊品种逐步改良成细毛羊，以提高羊毛质量。（附图片）
