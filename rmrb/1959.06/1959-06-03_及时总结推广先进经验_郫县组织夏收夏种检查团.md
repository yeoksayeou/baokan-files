Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 2nd: Pi County, Sichuan Province, organized a summer harvest and planting inspection team. Aiming at the problems discovered during the inspection, they promptly summarized and disseminated advanced experiences, promoting the summer harvest work.

During the inspection of the summer harvest work, the inspection team summarized and promoted three summer harvest methods from the Chongxing Commune: First, cadres at all levels personally participated in the harvesting and threshing work, setting an example of careful harvesting and gathering, and held on-the-spot meetings to calculate the detailed accounts of reducing scattering and increasing income. Second, establish a work system during the harvest period, weighing, recording output, and announcing the results to the masses on the spot. Third, affirm achievements and summarize experience in increasing production on the spot to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses, and apply the successful experience of implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture in spring crops as a reference for summer planting. After the commune implemented these methods, the phenomenon of scattering and wasting was greatly reduced. Merely by picking up dropped ears and grains, and re-threshing and re-screening, each mu yielded an extra ten to twenty jin of wheat. Pi County's summer harvest and planting inspection has greatly promoted current production. Personnel from various communes who participated in the inspection team promptly returned to their communes and teams to disseminate advanced experiences and good working methods from other regions, solving their own existing problems. The communes also proposed specific solutions based on the problems identified during the inspection, so that various production tasks can be completed with quality, quantity, and on time.

    及时总结推广先进经验
    郫县组织夏收夏种检查团
    据新华社成都2日电　四川郫县组织夏收夏种检查团，针对检查发现的问题及时总结传播先进经验，推动了夏收工作。
    检查团在检查夏收工作中，总结推广了崇兴公社的三项夏收办法：第一，各级干部亲自参加收打工作，做出精打细收的样子，并召开现场会议，算减少抛撒和增加收入的细账。第二，建立收获期间的工作制度，边过秤、边记产量、边向群众宣布结果。第三，就地肯定成绩、总结增产经验，鼓舞群众的干劲，并把小春作物贯彻八字宪法的成功经验参考应用于夏种。这个公社推行这些方法后，抛撒浪费现象大大减轻，仅由于拣落穗落粒和重打重筛，每亩就多收一二十斤麦子。郫县的夏收夏种检查，大大推动了目前生产。各公社参加检查团的人员对其他地区的先进经验和好的工作方法，都及时回社、回队进行传播，解决本身存在的问题。各公社还根据检查出的问题，提出具体解决措施，使各项生产任务都能按质、按量、按时完成。
