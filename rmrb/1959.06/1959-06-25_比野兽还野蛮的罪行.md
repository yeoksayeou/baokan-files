Crimes More Barbaric Than Beasts
Dong Fengya

The American army in Korea, it is said, styles itself as “defenders.” However, the South Korean people call them “two-legged beasts.” Whether “defenders” or “beasts,” the name should match the reality, so let us look at the facts.

On the night of April 3rd, two soldiers from the U.S. military headquarters stationed in Seoul robbed a taxi driver of his cash and belongings in Hannam-dong, Yongsan District. On the night of April 6th, they stopped a car on the main road in Yeongdeungpo, Seoul, and robbed the driver and passengers of their valuables.

In another incident, two American soldiers in a village in Yangju County, Gyeonggi Province, raped a pregnant woman, then cut her abdomen open and killed her with a knife.

On April 5th, three American soldiers attacked a Mr. Park's home in Huam-dong, Yongsan District, Seoul, threatened the homeowner with pistols and daggers, and robbed him of his main possessions.

On April 11th, U.S. Army Private First Class Ellis and Davis, belonging to the U.S. Air Force base at Osan Air Base in Osan-myeon, Pyeongtaek County, Gyeonggi Province, indiscriminately grabbed a farmer, Yu Gyeong-yeol, who was passing near the airport, beat him severely, and then set military dogs on him.

When the American beasts found girls picking wild vegetables on the mountain, they used them as targets for shooting practice, but they said they mistook them for pheasants. They killed a three-year-old child and said it was because the child stole gasoline.

These are just some of the incidents that occurred in nine days in April, and they are only those revealed in the South Korean press. According to statistics, there were one hundred and two atrocities committed by the American army in South Korea from January to April of this year. This statistic is far from complete. For example, it does not include incidents caused by U.S. military jeeps, and it is common to see American soldiers driving recklessly through busy streets, chasing women, and running people over.

Is there any objection to saying that the actions of these "defenders" are beastly? To say what distinguishes them from beasts, it is this: after a beast tears apart and eats a child, it will never say it is because the child offended it, but after the “two-legged beasts” kill a three-year-old child, they say it is because he stole their gasoline. May I ask, what kind of thing is gasoline, and how could a three-year-old child steal it? Beasts would never say to people: being eaten by me is the greatest glory, but the American army must lecture the victims every day: "Sacrificing for American interests is your greatest glory."

An American officer gave orders to his soldiers: "You can kill at will! Don't hesitate, whether you encounter children or old people. You must kill as many Koreans as possible, so that you can fulfill your obligations as American citizens!" "Korea is a country rich in gold, silver, and beautiful women, and these treasures and beauties will all belong to you." Hearing these yelping beastly words, it is very clear that although the American army is not as ignorant as beasts, it is more barbaric, more ferocious, and more cruel than real beasts, because they have the brutality of beasts in their minds and hold civilized killing tools in their hands.

We Chinese have personally experienced this kind of trampling by the Japanese invading army. When the American army was in mainland China (and still is in Taiwan), the Chinese people also personally experienced this kind of trampling, and only after we drove them away did we eradicate the root of this trampling. This ferocious beast perched on the heads of the South Korean people needs to be driven away by us together. What's more, they are not only carrying out trampling against the South Korean people, but also transporting atomic weapons into South Korea, attempting to carry out large-scale massacres against the people of the Far East! Beasts can be driven away, and must be driven away. The people of the world are carrying out this struggle to drive out the beasts!

    比野兽还野蛮的罪行
    董逢亚
    美国军队在朝鲜，据说是以“保卫者”自命的。但是，南朝鲜人民却都称它是“两只脚的野兽”。“保卫者”也罢，“野兽”也罢，名是应该以实为准的，那我们就要看一看事实了。
    4月3日夜晚，驻汉城的美军司令部两个士兵在龙山区汉南洞掠夺了汽车司机所带的现款和物品。4月6日晚上，他们又在汉城永登浦大马路上拦住汽车，抢走了司机和乘客的贵重品。
    另外两个美国士兵在京畿道杨州郡一个村庄强奸孕妇后又用刀割腹杀死她。
    4月5日，三个美军袭击汉城龙山区厚岩洞的一个姓朴的家，用手枪和短刀威胁房主，抢走了主要物品。
    4月11日，驻京畿道平泽郡乌山面的美军乌山空军基地所属美军二等兵伊利斯和戴维斯不分青红皂白地抓住路过机场附近的农民俞京烈，痛打一顿后，放军犬咬了他。
    美国野兽们发现在山上挖野菜的姑娘后，把她当作靶子练习了射击，可是他们还说是看错了，以为是山鸡。他们打死了三岁的孩子也说是因为孩子偷了汽油。
    这只是4月份九天中发生的一些事，而且只是从南朝鲜报刊上透露的，据统计，今年1至4月，美国军队在南朝鲜的暴行一百零二件。这个统计远不能说是完全的。比如它就不包括美军吉普车肇祸事件在内，而美国兵驱车在闹市横冲直撞，追逐女人，轧死轧伤人的事又是司空见惯了。
    说这些“保卫者”的行径是兽行，还会有什么异议吗？要说他们同野兽有什么不同，那就是：野兽撕食了一个小孩子以后，决不再说因为小孩触犯了它，而“两只脚的野兽”杀死三岁孩子以后，却说因为他偷了他们的汽油。请问汽油是什么样的东西，一个三岁的孩子如何能偷得了呢？野兽决不会向人说：你们被我吃掉是最光荣的，而美国军队却每天都要向牺牲者们训诫：“为美国利益牺牲是你们最大的光荣。”
    一个美国军官给士兵下命令说：“你们要随便杀掉！不管你们碰到的是孩子或老人，决不要犹豫。你们要尽量杀死朝鲜人，这样才能完成美国公民的义务！”“朝鲜是富有金银财宝和美女的国家，这些财宝和美女都会属于你们。”听了这些狺狺兽言，便十分明白：美国军队虽然没有野兽那样愚昧，却比真的野兽更野蛮更凶恶更残忍，因为他们思想里既有野兽的残性，手里又握有文明的杀人工具。
    我们中国人曾亲身尝受过日本侵略军的这种蹂躏，美国军队过去在中国大陆（现在还在台湾）时，中国人也曾亲身受到过这种蹂躏，而只是当我们把他们赶跑以后，才铲除了这种蹂躏的祸根。踞在南朝鲜人民头上的这个凶恶的野兽，是需要我们共同来赶跑它的。更何况它们不只是对南朝鲜人实行蹂躏，还把原子武器运进南朝鲜，企图对远东人民进行大规模的屠杀呢？野兽是可以赶跑的，而且必须赶跑它。全世界人民正在进行这种驱逐野兽的斗争！
