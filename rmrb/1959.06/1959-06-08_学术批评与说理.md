    Academic Criticism and Reasoning
    Lu Gong
    Actively carrying out academic criticism and adhering to the method of reasoning in academic criticism is a consistent proposition of our Party. Marxism is a fighting, critical doctrine. It has always developed in the struggle against various bourgeois academic thoughts. Actively carrying out academic criticism is essential for the development of Marxism. At the same time, Marxist academic criticism adopts the method of reasoning and convinces people with reason. Because reason is on the side of Marxism, not on the side of bourgeois academic thought. The reason why Marxism is invincible is because it is the truth. In the past, under the rule of the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie used all its ruling power to support various bourgeois academic thoughts, and did everything possible to suppress and destroy Marxism. But even in this situation, Marxism still relied on the power of truth to achieve victory over bourgeois academic thought. Today, in our country, the political situation has undergone fundamental changes, and the proletariat has gained a dominant position. Marxism has superior conditions in the ideological struggle. Especially after the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, it is even more conducive to Marxism to adopt the method of reasoning, and through academic criticism and discussion, to defeat various bourgeois academic thoughts and occupy various academic positions.
    Today, it is a foregone conclusion and beyond doubt that bourgeois academic thought is wrong and Marxism is correct. Why do we still emphasize that criticizing bourgeois academic thought should not adopt a simple negation method, but must adopt a detailed reasoning method? This is because, in academic thought, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will still have a long process. In today's situation, the vast majority of people in academic circles have politically accepted the socialist road, but in academic thought, Marxists among them are still a minority. For most people, why bourgeois academic thought is wrong still needs Marxists to explain the reasons fully to help them solve the problem; which academic thoughts are bourgeois, and why they are bourgeois, also needs Marxists to explain the reasons fully to help them judge. Therefore, we emphasize that criticism of bourgeois academic thought must adopt the method of reasoning, so as to persuade the majority of the masses through reasoning, so that they can realize the errors of bourgeois academic thought, get rid of the constraints that may be imposed by bourgeois academic thought, and stand on the position of Marxism.
    At the same time, the criticism of bourgeois academic thought we are conducting today generally falls within the scope of contradictions among the people. For scholars within the people who have bourgeois academic thoughts, we adopt the policy of helping them to carry out ideological transformation. We hope to persuade them to abandon erroneous bourgeois academic thoughts and accept the truth of Marxism through reasoned academic criticism. As long as they are willing to submit to the truth, we have the possibility to achieve this goal through reasoning, convincing people with reason. Of course, some people within the people will always refuse to submit to the truth and stubbornly cling to bourgeois academic thought, but that is not a major issue. When we criticize the bourgeois academic thoughts of such people, we still adhere to the method of reasoning, in order to persuade other people and reduce and eliminate the influence of this bourgeois academic thought.
    Therefore, whether from the perspective of educating the broad masses or from the perspective of winning over bourgeois scholars, the criticism of bourgeois academic thought must still adopt the method of reasoning. Only with reason can people be convinced. Only by explaining the reasons clearly can we help solve ideological problems. The method of simple negation cannot achieve the purpose of educating the masses, nor can it achieve the purpose of winning over and transforming bourgeois scholars. As Chairman Mao said, for ideological problems within the people, for problems in the spiritual world, "only by adopting the methods of discussion, criticism, and reasoning can correct opinions be truly developed, erroneous opinions be overcome, and problems be truly solved."
    Our advocacy of academic criticism to convince people with reason not only requires that the criticism be fully reasoned, but also requires that if the criticized person is not convinced, he must state his different opinions. There must be both criticism and counter-criticism. If the criticized person is not allowed to express his different opinions, then the different opinions still exist in the criticized person's heart, and the problem is not truly solved. Only by encouraging the criticized person to express his different opinions, conduct counter-criticism, and repeatedly refute these counter-criticisms with sufficient reasons, can the criticized person be truly convinced and can we truly achieve the purpose of convincing people.
    However, it must also be emphasized that our insistence on adopting the method of reasoning in academic criticism is not only for the purpose of convincing people. Convincing people is only one aspect of the purpose. The other aspect of the purpose, and perhaps even more important, is to improve and develop ourselves. We must use the criticism of bourgeois academic thought to train Marxist academic teams, improve the level of these teams, and occupy various academic positions. Adopting the method of simple negation to carry out academic criticism cannot only fail to convince people, but also cannot help to improve ourselves. Due to the complexity of academic issues, it is sometimes not easy to judge what is bourgeois thought and what is not. In this case, adopting the method of simple negation often easily leads to errors. The things that are simply negated are sometimes not or not entirely bourgeois things, and contain correct things that should not be negated. A Marxist must train himself to be able to keenly identify what is bourgeois academic thought in the complex academic field, to be able to fully explain why these academic thoughts are bourgeois, and why these bourgeois academic thoughts are wrong. And he must be able to defeat these bourgeois academic thoughts in repeated debates with reason. Otherwise, this Marxist is cultivated in a greenhouse, has not seen wind and rain, and has no strong vitality. Just as learning then knowing inadequacy, only through reasoning and debate can we know the complexity of academic issues, can we know the difficulty of thorough and sufficient reasoning, and can we deeply realize that academic criticism must have sufficient persuasiveness, must be based on scientific research, must master a large amount of material, conduct scientific analysis, and must combine combativeness with scientificity. In this process, the critic also improves his own level. Academic criticism must be able to stand firm and win in repeated debates, it must constantly enrich arguments, enrich arguments, and correct possible shortcomings and errors, so that it becomes more and more mature and perfect. In this process, the critic's thinking is also constantly developing. The two purposes of convincing people and improving oneself are thus combined.
    There must be both destruction and construction. Merely pointing out the errors of various bourgeois academic thoughts is not equivalent to occupying various academic positions. To occupy the position, in addition to clearing away bourgeois things, it is also necessary to come up with Marxist things to replace them. This requires a Marxist analysis of various academic issues. This creative construction work is often a more vast and arduous work than simply pointing out the errors of various bourgeois academic thoughts. Therefore, serious research work must be carried out in order to put forward well-founded Marxist academic innovations. At the same time, only by establishing Marxist academic thought can we truly and finally eliminate bourgeois academic thought. Only with construction can there be thorough destruction.
    Improving in struggle, creating in criticism, and establishing in destruction are the laws of development of all truth. The law of development of Marxism is also like this. It was so in the past, it is so now, and it will continue to be so in the future. Adhering to the method of reasoning in academic criticism and discussion is an important means for Marxism to use this law to develop itself.

    学术批评与说理
    卢弓
    积极开展学术批评，并且坚持采取说理的方法来进行学术批评，这是我们党一贯的主张。马克思主义是一种战斗的、批判的学说。它从来都是在同各种资产阶级学术思想作斗争中来发展自己的。积极开展学术批评正是发展马克思主义所必需的。同时马克思主义的学术批判采取说理的方法，以理取胜。因为，理是在马克思主义这边，而不是在资产阶级学术思想那边的。马克思主义之所以战无不胜，就因为它是真理。过去，在资产阶级的统治下，资产阶级用它全副的统治力量来支持各种资产阶级学术思想，对马克思主义则极尽压制与摧残的能事。但就在这种形势下，马克思主义仍然凭借真理的力量，取得对于资产阶级学术思想的胜利。今天，在我国，政治形势发生了根本的变化，无产阶级已经取得统治地位。马克思主义在思想斗争中，具有优胜的条件。尤其是经过了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，这就更加有利于马克思主义采取说理的方法，通过学术批评和讨论，战胜各种资产阶级学术思想，占领各个学术阵地。
    在今天，资产阶级学术思想是错误的，马克思主义是正确的，这是早成定论，无可怀疑的了。为什么我们还要强调批评资产阶级学术思想不能采取简单地否定的方法，必须采取细致的说理的方法呢？这是因为，在学术思想上，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，还要有一个长期的过程。在今天的形势下，学术界的绝大多数人在政治上都已接受社会主义道路，但在学术思想上，他们之中的马克思主义者仍然是少数。对于大多数的人来说，资产阶级学术思想为什么是错误的这个问题，还需要马克思主义者说出充分的道理来帮助他们解决；哪一些学术思想是资产阶级的，为什么它们是资产阶级的，这个问题，也需要马克思主义者说出充分的道理来帮助他们判别。因此，我们强调批评资产阶级学术思想必须采取说理的方法，以便通过说理来说服多数群众，使他们认识到资产阶级学术思想的错误，摆脱可能受到的资产阶级学术思想的束缚，站到马克思主义的立场上来。
    同时，我们今天进行的对资产阶级学术思想的批评，一般说来，属于人民内部矛盾的范围。对于人民内部的具有资产阶级学术思想的学者，我们采取帮助他们进行思想改造的方针。我们希望通过说理的学术批评，说服他们抛弃错误的资产阶级学术思想，接受马克思主义的真理。只要他们是愿意服从真理的，我们就有可能通过说理的方法，以理服人，达到这个目的。当然，人民内部也会有人始终不肯服从真理，死抱着资产阶级学术思想不放，那也无关大局。我们在批判这种人的资产阶级学术思想的时候，仍然坚持说理的方法，这是为了说服其他的人，缩小和清除这种资产阶级学术思想的影响。
    所以，无论从教育广大群众来说，还是从争取资产阶级学者来说，对于资产阶级学术思想的批评，仍然必须采取说理的方法。以理才能服人。讲清了道理才能帮助解决思想问题。简单地否定的办法，既达不到教育群众的目的，也达不到争取改造资产阶级学者的目的。正如毛主席说的，对待人民内部的思想问题，对待精神世界的问题，“只有采取讨论的方法，批评的方法，说理的方法，才能真正发展正确的意见，克服错误的意见，才能真正解决问题。”
    我们主张学术批评要以理服人，就不仅要求提出批评的时候要充分的说理，而且要求被批评者如果不服，就要讲出自己不同的意见。既有批评，也允许反批评。不让被批评者说出自己的不同的意见，那不同的意见仍然存在在被批评者的心中，问题并没有真正解决。只有鼓励被批评者说出自己的不同的意见，进行反批评，并且一次又一次地理由充足地驳倒这些反批评，才能使被批评者真正心服，使我们真正达到服人的目的。
    但是，还必须强调，我们坚持在学术批评中采取说理的方法，其目的并不仅仅是为了服人。服人只是目的的一个方面。目的的另一个方面，甚至可以说更重要的方面，是为了提高和发展自己。我们要通过对资产阶级学术思想的批评，来锻炼马克思主义的学术队伍，提高这个队伍的水平，占领各个学术阵地。采取简单地否定的办法进行学术批评，不仅不能服人，而且也无助于提高自己。由于学术问题的复杂，有时什么是资产阶级思想，什么不是资产阶级思想，并不是很容易判别的。在这种情况下，采取简单否定的方法每每容易导致错误。被简单否定了的东西，有时并不是或并不完全是资产阶级的东西，其中包含了不应当否定的正确的东西。一个马克思主义者，必须锻炼自己能够从复杂的学术领域中，敏锐地识别什么是资产阶级学术思想，能够充分地说出何以这些学术思想是资产阶级的，何以这些资产阶级学术思想是错误的道理。并且必须是能够在反复的辩论中从道理上战胜这些资产阶级学术思想的。否则，这个马克思主义者便是在温室里培养出来，没有见过风雨的，没有强大的生命力的。正如学然后知不足一样，通过说理和辩论，然后才知道学术问题之复杂，才知道说理透彻和充分之不易，才深切体会到学术批评要有充分的说服力，必须建立在科学研究的基础上，必须掌握大量的材料，进行科学的分析，必须把战斗性同科学性结合起来。在这之中，批评者也就提高了自己的水平。学术批评要能在反复的辩论中站得住脚并且获得胜利，就必须不断充实论据，丰富论点，纠正可能有的缺点和错误，使之越来越臻于成熟和完善。在这之中，批评者的思想也就在不断向前发展。服人和提高自己这两个方面的目的，就是这样结合在一起的。
    有破还要有立。仅仅是指出了各种资产阶级学术思想的错误，还不等于占领了各个学术阵地。要占领阵地，除了要清除掉资产阶级的东西，还需要拿出马克思主义的东西来代替。这就需要对各种学术问题进行马克思主义的分析。这种创造性的建设工作，往往是比单单指出各种资产阶级学术思想的错误更加浩繁和艰巨的工作。因此，必须进行认真的研究工作，才能提出论据充分的马克思主义的学术创见来。同时，也只有建立了马克思主义的学术思想，才能做到真正的、最后的破除资产阶级学术思想。有立才有彻底的破。
    在斗争中提高，在批判中创造，在破中立，这是一切真理发展的规律，马克思主义的发展规律也是这样。过去如此，现在如此，将来仍要如此。在学术批评和讨论中坚持说理的方法，正是马克思主义运用这个规律来发展自己的重要手段。
