Adhere to Theoretical Study

Comrade Yuan Busen, secretary of the CCP Wuzhai County Committee in Shanxi Province, has persisted in theoretical study for three years, reading more than 3.5 million words of Marxist-Leninist classics, which improved his theoretical level and promoted practical work.

Comrade Yuan Busen is an old cadre of peasant origin who has participated in the revolution for more than 20 years. In the past, although he also studied theory, he always felt that "distant water cannot quench present thirst, it is better to learn about current policies to solve problems." In addition, he was busy with work, so his theoretical study was always intermittent.

In recent years, the situation has developed faster and faster, and the work has become more and more complicated. Especially when some things in the work went against his wishes, Comrade Yuan Busen deeply felt that he needed to quickly master the theoretical weapon of Marxism-Leninism. In June 1955, he left his post to study at the Party School. During his studies, he specifically reviewed the path he had taken in the previous three years and determined to conquer the theoretical fortress of Marxism-Leninism. In 1956, he returned to Wuzhai County, and in the three years since then, in addition to reviewing the five courses he studied at the Party School, he also read Marxist classics such as "Das Kapital", "Theses on Feuerbach" and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong.

While diligently studying theoretical knowledge, Comrade Yuan Busen also paid great attention to going deep into the masses and linking up with reality. After learning the theory, he paid more and more attention to investigation and research work. Last year alone, he spent four and a half months going deep into the grassroots and living, eating, and laboring with the masses. During labor, he paid special attention to listening to the opinions of local elderly farmers, so that he could integrate the learned theory with the practical work at hand very well.

    坚持理论学习
    中共山西五寨县委书记袁步森同志，三年如一日地坚持理论学习，共读了马克思列宁主义经典著作三百五十多万字，提高了理论水平，推动了实际工作。
    袁步森同志是一位参加革命二十多年的农民出身的老干部，他过去虽然也学习理论，但总觉得“远水不解近渴，不如学学当前政策解决问题。”再加上工作忙，理论学习总是时断时续。
    近几年来，形势发展越来越快，工作越来越复杂，特别是当工作中出现一些事与愿违的事情的时候，袁步森同志深深感到自己需要迅速地掌握马克思列宁主义这个理论武器。1955年6月，他离职到党校学习。在学习中，他专门检查了前三年所走过的路程，下定决心要攻下马克思列宁主义的理论堡垒。1956年，回到五寨县，到现在，三年的时间，他除了复习在党校学习的五门课程以外，还读了“资本论”、“费尔巴哈论”等马克思主义的经典著作和毛泽东同志的著作。
    袁步森同志在认真攻读理论知识的时候，同时非常注意深入群众联系实际。学了理论以后，他越来越重视调查研究工作，去年一年，他深入基层和群众同吃同住同劳动的时间就达四个半月。在劳动中，特别注意听取当地老年农民的意见，因而能使学到的理论和当前工作的实际很好地结合起来。（附图片）
