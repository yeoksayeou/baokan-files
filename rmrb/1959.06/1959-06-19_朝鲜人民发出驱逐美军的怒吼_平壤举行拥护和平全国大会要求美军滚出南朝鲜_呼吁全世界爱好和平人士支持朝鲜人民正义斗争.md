Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 18th: A National Congress for Peace was held in the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang this evening. Han Seol-ya, Chairman of the Korean National Peace Committee, in his report at the meeting, demanded that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from South Korea, and called on all Korean people to launch a struggle to force U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea.

Among those attending the conference tonight were Park Jung-ae and Kim Chang-man, Vice-Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Nam Il, Vice-Premier of the Korean Cabinet, members of the Presidium of the Fatherland Front, heads of social organizations, and prominent figures from all walks of life.

In his report, Han Seol-ya said that the government of the Republic had made various efforts for the peaceful reunification of the country; last year, the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea, opening a new situation for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, U.S. imperialism violated the armistice agreement, continuously strengthened the Rhee Syngman puppet army, and shipped new types of weapons such as atomic missiles into South Korea, turning South Korea into an atomic war base.

Han Seol-ya said that these actions of the U.S. troops invading Korea not only hinder the peaceful reunification of Korea and seriously threaten the peace of Korea, but also are a provocation to peace in the Far East and the world. For the sake of peace in Korea and the Far East, U.S. troops must withdraw from South Korea.

Han Seol-ya said that all Korean people will launch activities on June 25th, "Day of Struggle to Force U.S. Troops to Withdraw from South Korea." Han Seol-ya, on behalf of the Korean people, expressed gratitude and respect to the World Peace Council and the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council for their appeal to support the struggle of the Korean people on "June 25th."

Han Seol-ya finally said that the Korean people will strengthen this struggle and will never give up until U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea.

Subsequently, representatives from all walks of life in Korea, including workers, farmers, youth, and women, spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously condemned the crimes of U.S. troops occupying South Korea, thus preventing Korea from achieving peaceful reunification, and turning South Korea into a living hell. They pointed out that the occupation of South Korea by U.S. troops is the root cause of all the suffering of the South Korean people. They shouted angrily at the venue: "U.S. troops get out of South Korea immediately!"

Choi Chae-ryun, a woman from Hwanghae Province who suffered from the atrocities of the U.S. military, painfully accused the U.S. military of its atrocities at the meeting. Her husband and son were killed by the U.S. military, and she herself escaped from the execution ground. In her speech, she firmly demanded that U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea and let the Korean people peacefully reunify their country.

The conference then adopted a "Letter to Peace-Loving People All Over the World," calling on peace-loving people all over the world to support the struggle of the Korean people.

The conference also adopted a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. The letter condemned the U.S. military for invading Korea under the guise of the United Nations flag and for currently undermining the armistice agreement and threatening peace in Korea and the Far East. The letter requested Hammarskjöld to take measures to urge U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea immediately.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 18th: The "Letter to Peace-Loving People All Over the World" adopted today by the Korean National Congress for Peace calls on peace-loving people all over the world to support the struggle of the Korean people to force U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea.

The "Letter to Peace-Loving People All Over the World" states: The Korean people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, welcome the "Day of Struggle to Force U.S. Troops to Withdraw from South Korea" scheduled for June 25th. The message expressed its belief that the just struggle of the Korean people to uphold peace, strive for national unity, and demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea will receive unanimous support from peace-loving people all over the world.

The "Letter to Peace-Loving People All Over the World" states that six years have passed since the Korean armistice, but peace in Korea is still seriously threatened, and the divided Korea has not yet been reunified. The U.S. imperialist aggressors are still forcibly occupying South Korea with military force, causing unbearable national misfortune to the Korean people.

The "Letter to Peace-Loving People All Over the World" points out that the people of northern Korea, through diligent and creative labor, have fundamentally changed the face of the country in a short period of time, and exploitation, poverty, unemployment, and hunger have disappeared forever. However, the people of South Korea have been deprived of even the most basic democratic rights and freedoms, and unemployment and hunger have swept across the entire South Korea. The South Korean people can only get rid of this situation by forcing U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea and realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The "Letter to Peace-Loving People All Over the World" states that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in accordance with the wishes of all the Korean people, has been making sincere efforts for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. It said that the Chinese People's Volunteers had completely withdrawn from northern Korea last year. However, the U.S. military not only does not intend to withdraw from South Korea, but continues to plot long-term occupation of South Korea, and uses war provocations to respond to the proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for peace and peaceful reunification of Korea. The United States has now expanded the Rhee Syngman puppet army from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions. The United States has also shipped atomic weapons into South Korea, established atomic weapons bases, and reorganized the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea into atomic units. "The dark clouds of war hang over South Korea, and the seeds of new atrocities continue to germinate in this breeding ground of war in South Korea."

It said that this is not only a serious threat to peace in Korea, but also a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. Peace in Korea cannot be maintained and consolidated, and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue cannot be expected. Without a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, a consolidated and lasting peace in the Far East and Asia is also impossible to achieve. It pointed out, "The root cause lies in the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism and the U.S. military's occupation of South Korea. The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea!"

The "Letter to Peace-Loving People All Over the World" points out that forcing U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea is a current and urgent task in the struggle to defend peace. It emphasizes that with the firm support of peace-loving forces around the world, the Korean people will surely force the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops to withdraw from South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    朝鲜人民发出驱逐美军的怒吼
    平壤举行拥护和平全国大会要求美军滚出南朝鲜
    呼吁全世界爱好和平人士支持朝鲜人民正义斗争
    新华社平壤18日电　朝鲜拥护和平全国大会今天晚上在平壤市牡丹峰剧场举行。朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长韩雪野在会上所作的报告中，要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜，并且号召全体朝鲜人民展开迫使美军撤出南朝鲜的斗争。
    参加今晚举行的大会的，有朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、金昌满，朝鲜内阁副首相南日，祖国战线议长团成员，各社会团体负责人和各界著名人士。
    韩雪野在报告中说，共和国政府为了和平统一祖国，进行了各种努力；去年，中国人民志愿军全部撤出了朝鲜，又为和平解决朝鲜问题打开了新的局面。但是，美帝国主义却违反停战协定，不断加强李承晚伪军，并且把原子导弹等新型武器运入南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变为原子战争基地。
    韩雪野说，侵朝美军的这些行动不仅阻碍着朝鲜的和平统一，严重威胁着朝鲜的和平，而且是对远东和世界和平的挑衅。为了朝鲜和远东的和平，美军必须撤出南朝鲜。
    韩雪野说，全体朝鲜人民将在6月25日展开“使美军撤出南朝鲜斗争日”的活动。韩雪野代表朝鲜人民，对世界和平理事会和亚非人民团结理事会发出关于在“六·二五”的时候支持朝鲜人民的斗争的号召表示感谢和敬意。
    韩雪野最后说，朝鲜人民将加强这一斗争，美军不撤出南朝鲜绝不罢休。
    接着，朝鲜的工人、农民、青年、妇女等各界代表相继在会上讲了话，他们一致谴责美军强占南朝鲜从而使朝鲜不能实现和平统一，并且把南朝鲜变成人间地狱的罪行。他们指出，美军强占南朝鲜，是南朝鲜人民一切苦难的根源。他们在会场上愤怒地高呼：“美军立即滚出南朝鲜！”
    身受美军残害的黄海南道妇女崔采莲在会上悲痛地控诉了美军的暴行。她的丈夫和儿子都被美军杀害，她自己则从刑场上死里逃生。她在讲话中坚决要求美军撤出南朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己和平统一祖国。
    大会接着通过了“告全世界爱好和平人民书”，呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民支持朝鲜人民的斗争。
    大会还通过了给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的信件。这封信件谴责了美军盗用联合国的旗帜侵略朝鲜，目前又破坏停战协定威胁朝鲜和远东和平的罪行。这封信件要求哈马舍尔德采取措施，促使美军立即撤出南朝鲜。
    新华社平壤18日电　朝鲜拥护和平全国大会今天通过的告全世界爱好和平人民书，呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民，支持朝鲜人民正在进行的迫使美军撤出南朝鲜的斗争。
    告全世界爱好和平人民书说：朝鲜人民同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，迎接定于6月25日举行的“使美军撤出南朝鲜斗争日”。文告表示相信，朝鲜人民拥护和平、争取民族统一和要求美军撤出南朝鲜的正义斗争，将受到全世界爱好和平人民的一致支持。
    告全世界爱好和平人民书说，朝鲜停战以后六年过去了，朝鲜的和平仍然受到严重的威胁，被分裂的朝鲜还没有得到统一，美帝国主义侵略者还在使用武力霸占着南朝鲜，给朝鲜人民造成了难以忍受的民族不幸。
    告全世界爱好和平人民书指出，朝鲜北部人民以勤劳和创造性的劳动，在短短的期间内使国家的面貌有了根本的变化，剥削、贫穷、失业和饥饿已一去不复返了。但是，南朝鲜的人民连起码的民主权利和自由都被剥夺了，失业和饥饿席卷了整个南朝鲜，南朝鲜人民要摆脱这种处境，只有迫使美军撤出南朝鲜，实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    告全世界爱好和平人民书说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府根据全体朝鲜人民的愿望，为了祖国的和平统一，一直进行了有诚意的努力。它说，中国人民志愿军已经在去年全部撤出了朝鲜北部。但是，美军不但不打算撤出南朝鲜，反而继续策划长期霸占南朝鲜的阴谋，并且用战争挑衅来回答朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为了和平和和平统一朝鲜所提出的建议。美国现在已经把李承晚傀儡军从停战时的十六个师扩大到三十一个师。美国还把原子武器运进了南朝鲜，建立了原子武器基地，并且把驻扎在南朝鲜的美军改编成原子部队。“战争的黑云笼罩着南朝鲜，新的惨酷的种子继续在南朝鲜这一战争温床里发芽。”
    它说，这不仅是对朝鲜和平的严重威胁，也是对远东和世界和平的严重威胁。朝鲜的和平得不到维护和巩固，朝鲜问题的和平解决也不可能期待。朝鲜问题得不到和平解决，远东和亚洲的巩固的持久和平也是不可能实现的。它指出，“祸根就在于美帝国主义者的侵略政策和美军对南朝鲜的霸占。美帝国主义侵略军必须立即撤出南朝鲜！”
    告全世界爱好和平人民书指出，迫使美军撤出南朝鲜是保卫和平的斗争中的当前迫切的任务。它强调说，朝鲜人民在全世界和平力量的坚决支持下，一定会使美帝国主义侵略军撤出南朝鲜，实现祖国的和平统一。
