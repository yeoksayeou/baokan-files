    Blood Debt
    Chi Bei'ou Poem Ying Tao Illustration
    Saigon News: Buying blood for American soldiers in South Vietnam has become a new business for many hospitals in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese authorities even explained: "Americans are not accustomed to the water and soil of Vietnam and must have Vietnamese blood to survive." Some South Vietnamese youths, driven by the need to survive, sign blood-selling contracts with hospitals, having one liter of blood drawn per month for only 300 South Vietnamese dollars, an amount that can only buy a few dozen kilograms of rice.
    American overlords descend on South Vietnam,
    Unaccustomed to the soil, they must drink human blood.
    Lackeys rush to collect tributes,
    Guaranteeing a steady and inexhaustible offering.
    The Ngo regime buys blood at a low price,
    Three mao of counterfeit currency for one cc.
    Squeezing dry all the blood vessels in their bodies,
    Not even enough to exchange for a few dozen kilograms of rice.
    Vampires are vampires in the truest sense,
    Blood merchants are traitors who harm the people.
    The people of South Vietnam are by no means lambs to be slaughtered,
    How can they feed them with their own blood?
    Seal the vampires' blood-guzzling mouths!
    Chop off the blood merchants' blood-soaked hands!
    Blood debts must be repaid in blood,
    The day of reckoning will not be too far away. (Image attached)

    血债
    池北偶　诗　英韬　图
    西贡消息：替在南越的美国军人买血已成为南越许多医院一项新业务。南越当局居然解释说：“美国人不习惯越南的水土，必须有越南人的血才能活下去”。一些南越青年为生活所迫，与医院签订卖血合同，一月被抽一公升血，仅得三百元南越币，这数目只能买几十斤大米。
    美国老爷君临南越，
    不服水土要喝人血，
    奴才赶忙收罗贡品，
    保证源源奉献无缺。
    吴记低价收买血液，
    三毛伪币抽一西西。
    挤瘪全身所有血管，
    还换不到几十斤米。
    吸血鬼是名副其实的吸血鬼，
    血贩子是残害人民的卖国贼。
    南越人民绝非任由宰割的羔羊，
    岂能用自己的鲜血把他们喂？
    封住吸血鬼的血口！
    斩断血贩子的血手！
    血债一定要用血来偿还，
    算账的日子不会太久。（附图片）
