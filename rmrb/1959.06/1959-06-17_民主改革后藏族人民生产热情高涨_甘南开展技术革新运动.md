Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 16th. Our reporter Zhai Qiyin reports: In the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province, farmers and herdsmen who have victoriously completed the democratic reform are showing great enthusiasm for production and have launched a large-scale technical innovation movement. Last winter and this spring, they have built more than 5,000 small canals, expanding the irrigated area by 200,000 mu, doubling the total irrigated area expanded in the eight years since liberation. They have promoted 150,000 pieces of various new animal-powered farm implements and tools created by the masses, basically eliminating the "two oxen pulling a plow" cultivation method. Manuring, row planting, and reasonable close planting have been implemented on most of the land. In advanced agricultural areas such as Lintan, many communes have also widely promoted drill sowing. Recently, Tibetan farmers, for the first time, joined Han and Hui farmers in weeding and fighting against frost and freezing, changing the habit of random sowing, no fertilization, no weeding, and no plowing that had been maintained in most areas in the past. After the realization of people's communes in pastoral areas, the boundaries of tribal grassland mountains have been broken down, unified management has been implemented, settled centers have been gradually established, and the work of building sheds and fences, storing fodder, grazing in separate groups, and dividing seasonal pastures has been widely carried out. The promotion of scientific feeding and management systems has begun. Herdsmen have treated and prevented diseases for 1.31 million head of livestock of various types in the past year, more than one and a half times the total number of livestock treated and prevented in the past five years, and large-scale aerial locust control work has been carried out on the grasslands. In order to rationally utilize and construct the grassland, the autonomous prefecture is now carrying out a comprehensive grassland survey and planning work.

Before the democratic reform last year, most areas of Gannan were still under feudal reactionary rule, with numerous tribes and scattered divisions. The reactionary feudal Tusi and headmen did not allow the people to understand the Party's policies and science and technology. They spread rumors and bewildered the public, saying that building canals would destroy the "earth's veins," reclaiming wasteland and planting grass would offend the "mountain gods," ground squirrels and locusts were not allowed to be killed, and deep plowing would damage the "earth's ribs" and cause natural disasters and man-made calamities. The dates for farmers to sow and harvest were also selected by the Living Buddha, which often delayed the season, causing the masses to not even be able to recover the seeds. In the movement of democratic reform and people's communes last year, the political consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups in Gannan was unprecedentedly raised, their minds were liberated, they dared to think and act, and their enthusiasm for construction was very high. In addition, through on-site observation, the broad masses of people demanded technical reforms.

In the past year, with the care of the Party and the help of Han cadres, agricultural technology promotion stations, meteorological stations, animal husbandry and veterinary work stations, grassland work stations, artificial insemination stations, and other institutions have been widely established in agricultural and pastoral areas to guide the masses to improve agricultural and animal husbandry production methods and promote scientific and technical measures. At the same time, vocational technical schools are being held and on-site teaching is being conducted to train a large number of Tibetan farmers and herdsmen technicians. In Lintan County alone, 19 agricultural technical secondary schools have been established, training more than 9,000 agricultural technicians of various types. Since last year, pastoral areas have trained 3,300 animal husbandry veterinarians and epidemic prevention technicians, of which more than 90% are Tibetan herdsmen.

    民主改革后藏族人民生产热情高涨
    甘南开展技术革新运动
    新华社兰州16日电　本社记者翟其寅报道：在甘肃省甘南藏族自治州，胜利完成民主改革的农牧民，生产热情十分高涨，开展了大规模的生产技术革新运动。去冬今春已兴修小型渠道五千余条，扩大灌溉面积二十万亩，比解放八年来扩大灌溉面积的总和翻了一番；推广各种新式畜力农具和群众创制的工具达十五万件，基本上消灭了“二牛抬杠”的耕作方式，并在绝大部分土地上实行了施肥，条播和合理密植，临潭等地先进农业区有许多公社还普遍推行了耧播。最近，藏族农民破天荒第一次跟汉、回族农民一道下地锄草和进行防霜防冻的斗争，改变了过去大部分地区所保持的乱撒籽、不施肥、不锄草、不翻地的习惯。牧业区实现人民公社化以后，已经破除了部落草山的界限，统一经营，逐步建立定居中心，广泛地开展了修棚搭圈、贮备饲草、分群放牧、划分四季草场的工作，开始推广科学的饲养管理制度。牧民们一年来为各类牲畜防治疫病一百三十一万头次，超过过去五年防治牲畜总和的一倍半，并在草原上进行了大规模的飞机灭蝗工作。为了合理地利用和建设草原，现在自治州还全面开展了草原调查规划工作。
    在去年民主改革以前，甘南大部分地区仍处于封建反动统治之下，部落林立，分散割据。反动的封建土官、头人不让人民群众了解党的方针政策和科学技术。他们造谣惑众，说什么修渠破坏“地脉”，垦荒植草是触犯“山神”，地鼠蝗虫不准打，深翻土地会坏“地肋骨”，要发生天灾人祸。农民下种、收割的日期也要由活佛择定，过去往往因此而延误季节，害得群众连籽种也拿不回来。在去年民主改革和人民公社化的运动中，甘南各族人民政治觉悟空前提高，解放了思想、敢想敢干，建设热情很高，加之各地通过现场观摩，广大群众纷纷要求技术改革。
    近一年来，在党的关怀和汉族干部的帮助下，广大农牧业区普遍建立了农业技术推广站、气象站、畜牧兽医工作站、草原工作站、人工授精站等机构，指导群众改进农牧生产方法、推广科学的技术措施；同时举办业余技术学校和进行实地传授，培养了大批藏族农牧民技术员，仅临潭一县即建立农业技术中学十九所，训练了九千多名各种农业技术员。牧业地区去年以来训练的畜牧兽医和防疫技术员达三千三百多人，其中90％以上是藏族牧民。
