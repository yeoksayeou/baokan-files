Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 2nd: Leading cadres of the Shanghai China Electrical Factory are further implementing the spirit of the rectification campaign by going deep into key workshops and teams to cultivate "experimental fields," promoting a rapid rise in product quality.

For more than a year, the quality of the paint baking section, an important link in the factory's production, had been consistently poor. Technical personnel believed the reason was the low technical level and carelessness of the workers, while the workers believed it was due to poor raw materials and outdated equipment. The leading cadres believed that the main reason was the lack of strong political and ideological work, so they sent people to strengthen political and ideological work, without further investigation. The quality problems of this section were not resolved. This situation also existed in many workshops and sections of the factory. In light of this situation, the factory's Party General Branch called on all cadres above the workshop director level to immediately go deep into key workshops and teams to work alongside the workers, cultivate experimental fields, analyze the quality situation with the masses, and propose measures to improve quality by addressing the problems. Factory Director Tang Jianbai led engineer Zhang Shuqi and a group of technical personnel to the paint baking section. Engineers and technicians operated together with the workers, and the factory director observed from the side. After several consecutive furnace tests and on-site discussions and analysis, the main reason for the poor quality of paint baking was found to be that the old formula and old operating methods were no longer adapted to the changed raw material conditions and equipment conditions. In the past, the raw material used was resin of particularly good quality, but now ordinary resin was used; in the past, it was baked in small furnaces, but now the furnaces had been enlarged. Another reason was the lack of a strict chemical testing system. After clarifying the reasons, everyone referred to the formulas of other factories, improved operating methods, and strengthened the chemical testing system, solving the paint baking quality problem that had not been solved for more than a year in just three days, basically eliminating waste paint and reducing the percentage of substandard paint from the original 50% to below 15%.

The factory's Party General Branch Secretary, Teng Qiming, took the third workshop, where product quality had always been the lowest in the factory, as an experimental field, organizing and mobilizing the masses to establish necessary rules and regulations, and vigorously promoting technological innovation. Liu Anfu, the director of this workshop, went deep into the fine wire enameling machine group, where the quality was the worst in the entire workshop, and worked alongside the workers on three machines in succession, improving the baking oven equipment and increasing the product qualification rate from more than 50% to more than 90%.

The cadres going deep down to cultivate experimental fields gave the workers great encouragement. The workers said, "With the leading cadres working together with us, we will definitely be able to improve quality." Workers such as Yan Hongzhen went all over toy stores and second-hand stalls to find materials and created an automatic paint adder, which increased the qualification rate of enameled wire to 98% to 99%.

After the rectification campaign, the leading cadres of this factory also engaged in experimental fields, but they did not persist due to being busy with work later. Now the factory's Party General Branch has decided to consolidate the system of cadres engaging in experimental fields and working alongside the workers, to further solve some key problems in production and management.

    上海中国电工厂领导干部深入基层种“试验田”
    对症下药改进产品质量
    新华社上海2日电　上海中国电工厂领导干部进一步贯彻整风精神，深入重点车间、小组种试验田，推动产品质量迅速上升。
    这个厂生产的重要环节烧漆工段一年多来质量一直不好。技术人员认为原因是工人技术水平低，操作马虎；工人认为是原料不好，设备陈旧。领导干部认为主要原因是政治思想工作不强，就派人去加强政治思想工作，以后再未深究。这个工段的质量问题却没有得到解决。这种情况在这个厂的不少车间和工段也存在着。根据这一情况，这个工厂的党总支号召全厂车间主任以上干部立即深入重点车间、小组跟班劳动，种试验田，和群众一起分析质量情况，对症下药提出改进质量的措施。厂长唐坚柏带领工程师张叔祁和一批技术人员，深入到烧漆工段。工程师和技术人员同工人一起操作，厂长在一旁观察。经过连续几炉试验和现场讨论分析，找出烧漆的质量不好的主要原因，是旧的配方和旧的操作方法已经不适应变化了的原料条件和设备条件。过去用的原料是质量特别好的树脂，现在用的是普通树脂；过去是小炉子烧，现在炉子改大了。另一个原因是缺乏严格的化验制度。查清原因以后，大家便参考其他工厂的配方，改进操作方法，加强化验制度，仅用三天功夫便解决了一年多没有解决的烧漆质量问题，基本上消灭了废漆，把次漆从原来的50％降低到15％以下。
    工厂党总支书记藤企明把产品质量在全厂一直是最低的第三车间作试验田，组织和发动群众建立必要的规章制度，大搞技术革新。这个车间的车间主任刘安福，深入到全车间质量顶差的细线漆包机组，先后在三台机器上跟班劳动，和工人一起改进了烘箱设备，把产品合格率从50％多提高到90％多。
    干部深入下去种试验田，给工人很大鼓舞。工人们说：“领导干部和我们在一起，一定能提高质量。”严洪震等工人，走遍了玩具商店和旧货摊找材料，创造了自动加漆器，使漆包线合格率提高到98％至99％。
    整风以后，这个工厂的领导干部也搞过试验田，后来工作一忙便没有坚持。现在工厂党总支决定把干部搞试验田、跟班劳动的制度巩固下来，进一步解决一些生产和管理上的关键问题。
