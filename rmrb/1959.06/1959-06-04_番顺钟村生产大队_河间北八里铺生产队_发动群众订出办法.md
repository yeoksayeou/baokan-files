According to the Hebei Daily, the Beibalipu Production Team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Hejian County, Hebei Province, mobilized the masses to make proper arrangements for the three aspects of summer harvest grain: harvesting, managing, and utilizing, striving to achieve good harvesting, good management, and good utilization as the summer harvest approaches.

This team has a total of 280 mu of wheat, growing well. In order to harvest, manage, and utilize it well, the team's Party branch mobilized the masses for discussion. During the discussion, most people believed that with a good harvest, it is necessary to harvest well, manage well, and conserve, and any wasteful behavior is wrong.

After everyone reached a consensus, they further studied and formulated specific methods for harvesting, managing, and utilizing well. The first is to harvest well. Based on past experience, they require achieving "three fasts" (fast harvesting, fast threshing, fast storage) and "four cleans" (clean ground, clean threshing ground, clean threshing machine, clean winnowing). To achieve this requirement, specialized teams for harvesting, transportation, threshing, and gleaning wheat are organized, implementing a responsibility system of "fixed time, fixed labor, fixed quantity, and fixed quality." Specific personnel are assigned to check the wheat's ripeness and grasp the principle of harvesting one plot as soon as it ripens and threshing one plot as soon as it's harvested. During the threshing process, four thorough threshings are required, striving to achieve "not losing a single ear, not dropping a single grain, and every grain goes into storage."

Manage well. The spirit of managing well should be implemented from the beginning of harvesting and threshing, first of all preventing rain and mildew. Before harvesting, warehouses should be arranged to achieve "four withouts," specific personnel should be assigned to manage the warehouse, strict grain storage procedures should be established, and the management system should be established and improved. Regular inspections and sunning should be carried out, and efforts should be made to prevent insects, rodents, rot, and theft. Managing grain well should be regarded as a political task, and leading cadres should regularly inquire about and solve problems in the management work, and effectively manage the grain well.

Utilize well. In the spirit of saving grain, using it sparingly, and ensuring that commune members are well-fed, methods such as segmented planned use of grain, rationing by person, implementing a meal ticket system, and contracting canteens are formulated. First, segmented use of grain. The amount of grain used is determined according to the intensity of agricultural work. Second, the grain consumption quota for each person is determined based on the age, appetite, and labor intensity of the entire team's population. At the same time, a meal ticket system is implemented, with meal tickets issued to each person monthly, eating by ticket, and saving money. In the spirit of large collective and small freedom, commune members are allowed to take meals home to eat, and they are also allowed to collect grain, flour, and vegetables from the canteen and start their own cooking. Each canteen reports a roster of rations per person monthly, and the production team distributes rations to the canteen monthly according to the roster, without subsidies for losses, and the surplus belongs to the canteen. The canteen makes a small calculation every day, a big calculation every ten days, and a summary every month, and regularly announces the accounts to the commune members.

    发动群众订出办法
    据河北日报消息　河北省河间县城关人民公社北八里铺生产队，在夏收即将到来的时候，发动群众妥善安排了夏收粮食的收、管、用三件事，力争作到收好、管好、用好。
    这个队共二百八十亩小麦，生长良好。为了收好、管好、用好，这个队的党支部发动群众进行了讨论。在讨论中，多数人认为丰收了必须收好、管好、节约，任何浪费行为都是不对的。
    大家的认识一致后，进一步研究和制订了收好、管好、用好的具体办法。首先是收好。根据往年经验，要求作到“三快”（快收、快打、快入仓），“四净”（地、场、轧、扬）。为达到这个要求，组织收割、运输、打场、拾麦专业队，实行“定时、定工、定量、定质”的责任制。确定专人检查小麦成熟情况，掌握熟一块、收一块、打一块。在打的过程中，要普轧四遍，力争作到“一穗不丢，一粒不掉，颗粒归仓”。
    管好。要从收割打场开始，就贯彻管好精神，首先防止雨淋和霉烂。在收割之前，就安排好仓库，实现“四无”，确定专人管库，严格粮食入库手续，建立与健全保管制度。定期检查和晾晒，做好防虫、防鼠、防烂、防盗。要把保管好粮食作为一项政治任务，领导干部定期过问和解决保管工作中的问题，切实把粮食管好。
    用好。本着节约用粮、细水长流、保证社员吃饱吃好的精神，制订了分段计划用粮、以人定量、实行饭票制、食堂包干等办法。首先分段用粮。依照农活轻重，确定用粮多少。第二是根据全队人口的年龄、饭量和劳动强度三方面的情况，确定每个人的吃粮指标。同时实行饭票制，把饭票按月分发给每个人，凭票吃饭，节约给钱。本大集体小自由的精神，允许社员把饭菜领回家去吃，也允许社员在食堂领粮领面领菜，自己起伙。各食堂每月造报一次以人定量的口粮名册，生产队根据名册按月把口粮包到食堂，亏不补，余归食堂。食堂一天一小算，十天一大算，一月一总结，定期向社员公布账目。
