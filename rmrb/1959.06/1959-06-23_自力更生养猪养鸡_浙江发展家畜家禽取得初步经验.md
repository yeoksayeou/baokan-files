Zhejiang Achieves Preliminary Experience in Developing Livestock and Poultry

    Our Newspaper reports: Zhejiang Province has gained preliminary experience in developing livestock and poultry. The main contents of these experiences are:

    1.  Educate cadres and the masses to recognize the importance of developing livestock and poultry for increasing fertilizer, increasing income for commune members, and increasing the supply of meat for urban and rural people through methods such as accounting and comparison. Last year, Zhanshan Production Team raised 252 pigs, with a net income of 30 yuan per pig after deducting costs, and an average distribution of more than 92 yuan per household; the team increased pig manure by more than 9,000 dan, increasing grain production by more than 90,000 jin compared to 1957. After calculating this account, the commune members' enthusiasm was very high, and they said, "Raising more pigs is equal to harvesting a few more dan of grain."

    2.  Thoroughly publicize the principles and policies for developing livestock and poultry, and at the same time solve the specific problems of commune members raising livestock and poultry, such as funds, feed, and labor time.

    3.  Effectively solve the source problems of piglets, chicks, ducklings, and goslings. In order to fully meet the needs of commune members to increase livestock and poultry raising, various localities have adopted many methods. In developing piglet production, methods such as self-breeding and self-raising and establishing breeding pig farms by communes and teams are used to breed piglets. After Yuyao County adopted the above methods, the number of sows in the county rapidly increased from 1,700 in March to more than 31,000 by the end of May, an increase of more than ten times compared to the same period last year. In developing chicks and ducklings, various localities vigorously carried out spring hatching, with communes and teams running hatching workshops and households hatching chickens and ducks. At present, there are 330 commune-run hatching workshops in the province, which have already hatched 14.9 million eggs.

    4.  Effectively solve the feed problem. In addition to adopting the method of allocating three to five li of feed base for each pig raised, various localities have also mobilized the masses to adopt the following eight-character method: "Plant," use scattered land such as around houses, ponds, rivers, roads, and fields to plant feed according to seasonal characteristics; "Raise," use water surfaces to cultivate aquatic feeds such as water hyacinth and water hyacinth; "Collect," mobilize children and semi-able-bodied laborers to collect wild feed; "Utilize," fully utilize rapeseed stalks, rapeseed pods, grass seeds, sweet potato vines, etc. to process feed; "Store," store grass seeds, green grass, and other green feed in spring and summer for winter feeding; "Catch," organize semi-able-bodied laborers to catch snails, loach, shellfish, eels, locusts, etc. to feed poultry; "Breed," artificially breed insects to feed poultry; "Release," select harvested white paddy fields and idle land for mobile grazing of poultry.

    5.  Do a good job in epidemic prevention and reduce pig deaths. Various localities have reorganized and established veterinary organizations, formed a veterinary work network, and actively trained veterinary personnel. The province has established 801 veterinary stations, with 1,636 full-time veterinarians. Two million pigs in the province have been given a disease prevention injection.

    自力更生养猪养鸡
    浙江发展家畜家禽取得初步经验
    本报讯　浙江省在发展家畜家禽工作方面，已经获得了初步的经验。这些经验的主要内容是：
    一、通过算账、对比等方法，教育干部和群众认识到发展家畜家禽对增加肥料、增加社员收入、增加城乡人民肉类供应的重要性。占山生产队去年养猪二百五十二头，除成本外，每头猪净收入三十元，每户平均分到九十二元多；全队增加猪肥九千多担，比1957年增产粮食九万多斤。算了这一笔账以后，社员情绪十分高涨，并说；“多养猪，就等于多打几担谷”。
    二、深入地宣传发展家畜家禽的方针政策，同时解决社员饲养家畜家禽的资金、饲料、劳动时间等具体问题。
    三、切实解决仔猪和小鸡小鸭小鹅的来源问题。为了充分满足社员增养家畜家禽的需要，各地采取了许多办法。在发展仔猪生产方面，采取自繁自养和社、队建立种猪场的办法繁殖仔猪。余姚县采用了上述办法后，全县母猪头数从3月份的一千七百头到5月底迅速增加到三万一千多头，比去年同期增长十倍以上。在发展小鸡小鸭方面，各地大力开展了春季孵化，社社队队搞孵坊、家家户户孵鸡鸭，目前全省社办的孵坊就有三百三十个，已孵种蛋一千四百九十万只。
    四、切实解决饲料问题。各地采取每养一头猪拨给三至五厘饲料基地的办法外，还发动群众采取了以下的八字方法：“种”，利用屋边、荡边、河边、路边、田边等零星土地，根据季节特点种植饲料；“养”，利用水面养殖水浮莲、水葫芦等水生饲料；“采”，发动儿童和妇女半劳动力采集野生饲料；“利”，充分利用油菜秆、油菜荚、草子、蕃薯茎叶等加工饲料；“贮”，在春夏季贮藏草子、青草等青饲料留作冬季喂养；“捉”，组织半劳动力捉田螺、泥鳅、螺蛳、黄鳝、蝗虫等喂养家禽；“育”，人工育虫喂家禽；“放”，选择收割后的白田畈和闲地流动放牧家禽。
    五、做好防疫工作，减少生猪死亡。各地都整顿与建立了兽医组织，组成兽医工作网，积极训练兽医人员。全省已建立兽医站八百零一个，有专职兽医人员一千六百三十六人。全省二百万头生猪已进行了一次防疾注射。
