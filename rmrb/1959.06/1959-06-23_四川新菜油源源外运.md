Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu. Since the start of pressing new rapeseed in Sichuan Province in mid-May to June 17th, more than 2,500 tons of new oil have been shipped out via the Sichuan River and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

At present, Sichuan Province has placed rapeseed oil transportation in an important position. The provincial commercial department and transportation department jointly held a telephone conference, requiring all localities to earnestly ensure the transfer and transportation of edible oil. The railway and shipping departments have ensured that rapeseed oil is transported as soon as it arrives. Wenjiang, Mianyang, Dazhou and other major rapeseed producing areas have strengthened short-distance transportation forces. On the one hand, they have transferred automobiles to quickly collect and transport the oil, and on the other hand, they have organized commune professional teams to undertake short-distance transportation.

This year, Sichuan Province has achieved a bumper harvest of rapeseed. The province plans to transfer about twice as much rapeseed oil from June to September as in the same period last year. At present, in addition to strengthening procurement and allocation, various localities are also improving rapeseed processing equipment to increase the oil yield of rapeseed.
