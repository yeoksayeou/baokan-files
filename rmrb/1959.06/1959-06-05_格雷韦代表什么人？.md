    Whom Does Grewe Represent?
    Chen Youwei
    Mr. Wilhelm Grewe, the West German representative participating in the Geneva Conference, is a figure who has just begun to emerge in East-West international conferences. He seems eager to use this opportunity to deliberately attract attention. Therefore, in his speeches every few days, he always rackes his brains to fabricate some sensational fallacies.
    Some time ago, he reversed black and white to slander the German Democratic Republic as a "police state," which was sternly refuted by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. At the June 2nd meeting, Mr. Grewe had a new "creation." He attempted to prove that the regime of the German Democratic Republic "does not represent the German people" but "only represents itself."
    What should be the most important criterion for measuring whether a regime represents and can represent the people of its own country? That is to see whether it represents the will, aspirations, and interests of the vast majority of the people of its own country. What is the most urgent national aspiration of the German people today? It is to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, eliminate the remnants of militarism, prevent the revival of militarism, and achieve the unification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy, so that the entire Germany can embark on a healthy path of peaceful and democratic development. From the first day of its birth, the German Democratic Republic declared a complete break with the Prussian and fascist militarist traditions, and took peace, democracy, and the promotion of human progress as its own responsibility. The German Democratic Republic thoroughly implemented the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and eliminated the remnants of militarism within its own territory. On the track of peace and socialism, its economy, culture, and social life have been vigorously developed.
    At this Geneva Conference, the representatives of the German Democratic Republic have repeatedly stated their views and demands, requesting the conference to reach an agreement on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, requesting the end of the occupation system in West Berlin, and suggesting that negotiations be held with West German representatives on the issue of concluding a treaty of non-aggression between the two Germanys and gradually seeking German unification through close cooperation. The representatives of the German Democratic Republic conveyed the true voice of the German people and expressed the deep aspirations of the German people, and are therefore the true representatives of the German people. Even if Mr. Grewe inherits Goebbels' mantle and is good at reversing black and white, he cannot change this fact.
    What is doubtful is: Whom do Mr. Grewe and the Adenauer regime he represents actually represent? In Geneva and around the world, all those who are paying attention to the East-West Foreign Ministers Conference have seen a strange phenomenon: Grewe and his superior Brentano not only claim to be representatives of West Germany, but also resolutely oppose participating in the Geneva Conference as "official representatives," and even oppose the use of German at this meeting discussing German issues with Germans participating!? Brentano, as the head of the West German delegation, dared not show his face at the Geneva Conference, and hid in a hotel on the shores of Lake Geneva all day long as a recluse. What is even more strange is that the West German representatives, who claim to care about the interests of the German nation, resolutely oppose the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and oppose the end of the occupation system in West Berlin, fearing that the conference will reach an agreement on these issues! Where is there even a little bit of national self-esteem? No wonder the Social Democratic member of the West German Bundestag, Kreyssig, also angrily accused the West German representatives of playing a "shameful role" at the conference!
    These "shameful roles" were sent to Geneva on Adenauer's orders to sabotage the East-West Foreign Ministers Conference. Their words and deeds at the meeting are still being remotely manipulated by Adenauer. They are unwilling to see any small progress at the Geneva Conference, in order to continue to maintain the current division of Germany and international tension, and to accelerate the completion of the plan to rearm West Germany. Such representatives, of course, have nothing in common with the true interests of the German people. If it must be said that they also represent some "Germans," then these Germans are definitely not the dockworkers of Hamburg or the farmers of Bavaria, nor are they the considerable number of German orphans and widows who lost their loved ones in the last war. The "Germans" represented by the West German representatives can only be Mr. Adenauer, the loyal executor of American power politics, Krupp, the arms king and war manufacturer, and the former Nazi generals Speidel and Heusinger, whose hands are stained with the blood of the European people. Mr. Grewe, a fascist propagandist who once served Hitler, should be very clear about this.

    格雷韦代表什么人？
    陈有为
    参加这次日内瓦会议的西德代表威廉·格雷韦先生，是在东西方国际会议上初露头角的一个脚色。他似乎急于想借这个机会来故意引人注目。因此在他每几天一次的发言中，总要挖空心思地制造出一些耸人听闻的谬论来。
    前些日子，他颠倒黑白地诬蔑德意志民主共和国是一个“警察国家”，受到了苏联和德意志民主共和国外长的严正驳斥。在6月2日会议上，格雷韦先生又有了新的“创造”。他企图证明，德意志民主共和国的政权“不代表德国人”而“只代表它自己”。
    要衡量一个政权是不是和能不能代表它本国的人民，最主要的标准应该是什么呢？那就是看它是否代表它本国绝大多数人民的意志、愿望和利益。德国人民当前最迫切的民族愿望是什么？就是缔结对德和约、肃清军国主义的残余、防止军国主义的复活，就是在和平民主基础上实现德国的统一，使整个德国走上和平民主发展的健康道路。德意志民主共和国从诞生的第一天起，就宣告同普鲁士的和法西斯的军国主义传统完全决裂，而以和平、民主和促进人类进步为己任。德意志民主共和国彻底实现了波茨坦协定的规定，在自己的境内肃清了军国主义的残余。在和平和社会主义的轨道上，它的经济文化和社会生活得到了蓬勃的发展。
    在这次日内瓦会议上，德意志民主共和国的代表多次申述自己的见解和主张，要求会议就缔结对德和约问题达成协议，要求结束西柏林的占领制度，并建议同西德代表就缔结两个德国互不侵犯条约和通过接近合作而逐步谋求德国统一的问题进行谈判。德意志民主共和国代表传出了德国人民真正的声音，表达了德国人民的深切愿望，因而是德国人民真正的代表。格雷韦先生即使继承了戈培尔的衣钵，善于颠倒黑白，也无法改变这个事实。
    值得怀疑的倒是：格雷韦先生和它所代表的阿登纳政权究竟代表什么人？在日内瓦，在世界各地，所有注意着东西方外长会议的人们都看到了一种奇怪的现象：格雷韦和他的上司勃伦塔诺既自命为西德代表，又要坚决反对以“正式代表”的身份参加日内瓦会议，甚至反对在这个有德国人参加的讨论德国问题的会上使用德文！？勃伦塔诺身为西德代表团的团长，却不敢在日内瓦会议上露面，终日躲在莱蒙湖畔的旅馆里当寓公。更奇怪的是，口口声声以关怀德国民族利益自居的西德代表，却在会上坚决反对缔结对德和约，反对结束西柏林的占领制度，唯恐会议就这些问题取得协议！这哪里还有一点点民族自尊心呢？难怪西德社会民主党的联邦议员克赖西希，也要愤愤不平地指责西德代表在会上充当“可耻的角色”了！
    这些“可耻的角色”，是奉阿登纳之命到日内瓦来破坏东西方外长会议的。他们在会上的一言一行，一举一动，也仍然受到阿登纳的远距离操纵。他们不愿意日内瓦会议有任何微小的进展，为的是继续保持目前的德国分裂局面和国际紧张局势，加速完成重新武装西德的计划。这样的代表，当然是同德国人民的真正利益毫无共同之点的。如果一定要说他们也代表一些“德国人”的话，那未这些德国人决不是汉堡的码头工人或巴伐利亚的农民，也不是在上次战争中失去了亲人的为数可观的德国孤儿寡妇。西德代表所代表的“德国人”，只能是美国实力政策的忠实执行者阿登纳先生，军火大王——战争制造商克虏伯，和双手沾满了欧洲人民鲜血的前纳粹将领斯派达尔和豪辛格之流。对于这一点，曾经为希特勒效劳的法西斯主义鼓吹者格雷韦先生，应该是知道得很清楚的。
