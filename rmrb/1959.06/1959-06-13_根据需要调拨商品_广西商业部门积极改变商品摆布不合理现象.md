Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, June 12th. Guangxi commercial departments, while vigorously organizing the supply of light industrial products, are rationally allocating and transferring commodities.

Guangxi commercial departments inspected market supply and inventory, and found that the distribution of some commodities was not entirely reasonable, with some areas experiencing stockpiles and others facing shortages. For example, some rural stores had stockpiles of electric light bulbs, insulated wires, high-end soaps, and other commodities needed in cities. Starting in the second quarter, commercial departments began to focus on rationalizing commodity distribution, adhering to the principle of "ensuring key areas and accommodating general needs." Based on regional characteristics, population size, and purchasing power, commodities were categorized into those requiring supply and those not requiring supply, those urgently needing supply and those that could be supplied later, and those needing more supply and those needing less supply for allocation. For example, electric light bulbs and electric fans were mainly supplied to cities, while batteries were mainly supplied to rural areas. Of the batteries supplied throughout the region in the second quarter, 80% were allocated to rural areas. As for rubber shoes, commercial departments considered that the areas supplied by Nanning and Liuzhou, the two secondary-level stations, were the main cities and industrial and mining areas within the autonomous region, with concentrated populations and relatively high purchasing power, so they allocated more rubber shoes to these areas.

In terms of commodity variety, efforts were also made to cater to the diverse preferences of different consumers. High-end commodities were mainly supplied to cities. For areas where Dong, Miao, and Yao people reside, more Fuxing cotton cloth, dark blue cloth, and lace for women were supplied, as these are favored by the local people. For areas where Zhuang people reside, more checkered and diagonal patterned fabrics preferred by the Zhuang people were supplied.

Commercial departments adopted a method of combining top-down and bottom-up approaches, fully consulting and coordinating, and uniformly allocating commodities. They also frequently used meetings and materials exchange fairs to make mutual adjustments. Recently, Nanning, Liuzhou, Baise, and other special districts held materials exchange fairs to mutually adjust inventories of daily-use industrial products.

    根据需要调拨商品
    广西商业部门积极改变商品摆布不合理现象
    新华社南宁12日电　广西商业部门在大力组织轻工业品货源的同时，合理分配调拨商品。
    广西商业部门检查了市场供应和库存情况，发现部分商品的摆布不尽合理，有的地区积压，有的地区供不应求。如有些农村商店积压了大量城市需要的电灯泡、皮花线、高级香皂等商品。从第二季度起，商业部门就注意抓商品合理摆布这一个工作，掌握“保证重点，照顾一般”的原则，根据地区特点、人口多寡、购买力高低，把商品分成需要供应与不需要供应、急需供应与暂缓供应、需要多供应与可以少供应等几种类型，进行调拨。如电灯泡、电风扇等，主要供应城市；电池主要供应农村。全区第二季度供应的电池，80％的货源调拨给农村。再如胶鞋，商业部门考虑到南宁、柳州两个二级站所供应的区域，是自治区内的主要城市和工矿区，人口集中，购买力较高，胶鞋货源就分配得多些。
    在商品的花色品种上，也尽量照顾不同消费者的不同喜爱。高级商品主要供应城市。对侗族、苗族、瑶族人民聚居的地区，多供应当地人民喜爱的复兴纺、毛蓝布和妇女用的花边，对僮族人民聚居的地区多供应方格吱、斜格吱等僮族人民所喜欢的布匹。
    商业部门采取上下结合、充分协商、统一调拨的办法，合理分配调拨商品，并且经常采用会议和物资交流会的形式相互调剂。最近，南宁、柳州、百色等专区都召开了物资交流会，相互调剂了日用工业品的库存。
