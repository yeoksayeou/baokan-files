Dai Folk Singer Kang Langying, Translated by Chen Guipei

I stand on Elephant Mountain in Menghai,
	Looking at the Liusha River Reservoir Dam,
My heart is filled with a thousand songs,
	My heart churns with ten thousand words.
I stand on Elephant Mountain in Menghai,
	Gazing afar at Yigao clasping hands towards Beijing,
Benefactor! Chairman Mao, Communist Party!
	Liusha River! Oh, Dam,
It has blocked the savage floods,
	It has wiped away the tears of the Dai people.
A thousand nights we dreamed,
	We dreamed of cool river water,
Flowing onto our parched hearts.
	Benefactor! Chairman Mao, Communist Party!
With this basin of lake water,
	Our barren Menghai坝子 has changed its appearance.
The mango flowers have just emitted their fragrance,
	Our坝子,
Is like being covered by a green carpet;
	We no longer yearn for Miebawei's tears,
Mangoes fall from the trees,
	The wind turns our grains yellow,
The sun dries our grains.
	The harvest season has arrived,
The beautiful peacocks,
	Have also put on bright new clothes,
Dancing the harvest dance in the forest.
	I stand on this high Elephant Mountain,
Gazing afar at Yigao clasping hands towards Beijing,
	Benefactor! Chairman Mao, Communist Party!
With your blessings bestowed upon our border region,
	Hunger and demons
Will no longer prowl around our bamboo houses;
	Even if it is dry for ten years,
The full trees of kapok flowers,
	Will also blossom towards Yigao Beijing.

Note:
?Yigao Beijing: "Yigao" is the center of the Dai paradise, that is, the capital. Clasping hands is a Dai greeting.
?In the past, the Dai people only sowed rice seedlings when the mango flowers withered.
?Miebawei's tears: In Dai legend, rain only falls when the rain god Miebawei sheds tears.

### 向依高北京合掌?

    向依高北京合掌?
    傣族歌手　康朗英作　陈贵培译
    我站在勐海的象山上，
    望着那流沙河水库大坝，
    心里涌出了千首歌，
    心里翻滚着万句话。
    我站在勐海的象山上，
    遥望着依高北京合掌，
    恩人呵！毛主席，共产党！
    流沙河！大坝呵，
    它堵住了横蛮的洪水，
    它使傣家人揩干了眼泪。
    我们做梦的一千个夜晚，
    我们梦见清凉的河水呵，
    淌在我们干渴的心上。
    恩人呵！毛主席，共产党！
    有这一盆湖水呵，
    我们荒凉的勐海坝子变了样。
    芒果花才发出喷香?，
    我们的坝子呵，
    就像复盖一块绿色的地毯；
    灭巴威的眼泪我们也不再希罕?，
    芒果从树上掉下，
    风把我们的谷粒吹黄，
    太阳把我们的谷粒晒干。
    收割的季节到啦，
    美丽的孔雀，
    也换上了鲜艳的新装，
    在森林里跳着丰收的舞蹈。
    我站在这高高的象山上，
    遥望着依高北京合掌，
    恩人呵！毛主席，共产党！
    有了你的福气降到我们边疆，
    饥饿和魔鬼
    再不来我们竹楼下打转；
    天干十年呵，
    满树的攀枝花呀，
    也会朝着依高北京开放。
    注：?依高北京：“依高”是傣语乐园中心，即首都。合掌是傣族礼敬。
    ?过去傣族人民在芒果花谢的时候才撒秧。
    ?灭巴威眼泪，傣族传说，灭巴威雨神淌眼泪天才下雨。
