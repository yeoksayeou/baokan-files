Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 29th: Party organizations at all levels in Tianjin Municipality have admitted more than 41,000 new party members from "July 1st" last year to the eve of "July 1st" this year.

    Over the past year, they have played an active role on the industrial, agricultural, commercial, cultural, educational, and health fronts. Among the fifty-eight probationary party members in the Tianjin Wool Processing Factory, forty-three have been rated as advanced producers by the factory, and two have been rated as municipal labor models. Probationary party member Lin De-shi had no rejects for several consecutive years in the past. After joining the Party, he became even more diligent and actively motivated others, becoming a model for mechanical workers throughout the city. Wang Wenqi, a probationary party member at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Machinery Factory, has carried out more than 30 technical innovations since the beginning of this year. The implementation of one of the larger ones, the "multi-head drill," alone increased production efficiency by twenty-five times. Liang Gui-rong, a probationary party member in the Northwest Corner Street, is nearly sixty years old this year. Since liberation, she has diligently served the residents of the street, cared for them, lived a frugal life, and achieved great results in her work. She serves as the deputy director of the street production cooperative and the director of the savings service station. Under her exemplary actions, the vast majority of the surrounding residents have participated in savings.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 29th: From January to May this year, Party organizations in Jiangsu Province admitted more than 1,600 intellectuals into the Party.

    Among the newly admitted senior intellectuals are: Pan Shen-ming, Vice President of Jiangsu Normal College and Deputy Mayor of Suzhou; Wang Tong-guan, Vice President of Suzhou Medical College; Han Ru-lin, Director of the History Department of Nanjing University; Yang Jing-zhi, Researcher at the Institute of Paleontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Cheng Yi-de, Chief Mechanical Engineer of Nanjing Yongli Ning Factory; Ding Ze-min, Director of the Hemorrhoid Department of Nanjing Chinese Medicine Hospital; and Shen Pei-hua, a famous actress of the Jiangsu Opera Troupe.

    The intellectuals who joined the Party this year have all been tested by previous political movements and work exercises, and have a high degree of communist consciousness. Many have been rated as outstanding workers and advanced workers. Li Yang-han, a professor at Nanjing Agricultural College, actively sought ways to improve the quality of teaching while seconded to the countryside with the school. In order to teach the botany course well, he collected specimens in the field himself, made experimental instruments himself, and humbly asked old farmers for advice on things he didn't understand. He was also very concerned about the production of the commune and took the initiative to suggest that the commune collect local herbal pesticides to prevent and control pests and diseases. The commune adopted his suggestion and mobilized its members to collect more than 10,000 kilograms of herbal pesticides within a few days, solving 30% of the problem of spraying wheat seedlings. Cheng Yi-de, the chief mechanical engineer of Yongli Ning Factory, participated in the mutual aid association and the pickets led by the factory's underground party organization before liberation, carrying out factory protection struggles. After liberation, he has always been active in his work, often going deep into the workshop to work with workers and technicians to study and solve various equipment problems. Gao Gu-shen, attending surgeon of the Department of Urology at the First People's Hospital of Changzhou, has performed nearly a thousand urological operations in the past three years without any accidents. Due to Gao Gu-shen's active and responsible work and significant achievements, he has been rated as a municipal labor model for three consecutive years and received a certificate and medal from the Ministry of Health in 1958.

    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 29th: Party organizations have been universally established in the pastures and agricultural areas of the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County on the Pamir Plateau. Communist Party members of Tajik, Kyrgyz, and other ethnic groups have become the backbone force for the Party to maintain close ties with the masses and promote agricultural and livestock production.

    Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County is a vast and sparsely populated mountainous area, and farmers and herdsmen live scattered in the mountains of more than 50,000 square kilometers, with very inconvenient transportation. In order to implement the Party's policies, communist party members of all ethnic groups often ride horses over mountains and ridges, traveling hundreds of miles to remote agricultural areas and pastures to conduct propaganda among the masses, regardless of the severe cold and heat.

    This year, the Bing Shan (Ice Mountain) People's Commune decided to build a 20-kilometer-long canal that can irrigate 2,000 mu of cultivated land and 5,000 mu of pasture. The commune Party committee assigned this task to Gu Li-Hu Li (Tajik), the secretary of the Party branch of the Third Production Brigade, to be fully responsible. Although Gu Li-Hu Li did not understand canal construction engineering, and there were no water conservancy technicians at the time, he worked day and night with the masses to study the canal construction plan. In the severe winter of the Pamir Plateau, he first moved his yurt to the canal construction site under the Muztagh Ata snow mountain. Under his influence, the masses of the Third Brigade also moved their yurts to the construction site. Finally, the canal was completed before the spring plowing.

    In early May of this year, the Pamir region had heavy snowfalls, and the livestock that had been transferred to the high mountain summer pastures were blocked on the mountains by the heavy snow. The Party committees of the various people's communes and the Party branches of the production brigades held emergency meetings to mobilize farmers and herdsmen to rescue livestock. In this struggle against the snowstorm disaster, many communist party members demonstrated the communist quality of selflessness. Ma Chai-xin (Tajik), a member of the Party committee of the Yarkand People's Commune, organized six people to climb to the top of the mountain from a cliff more than 100 meters high, and used ropes to hang shepherds and sheep down one by one.

    Gu Er-lai-ke, a Tajik female communist party member of the Xinsheng People's Commune, was assigned eighty thin mountain goats by the commune to graze. Many cadres worried about her, fearing that these thin mountain goats would not be able to survive the winter and spring, but because of her careful breeding, all the mountain goats safely survived the spring, and gave birth to eighty lambs, with a survival rate of still as high as 97.5%.

    增加新的血液　壮大党的队伍
    天津江苏新党员在建设战线上起带头作用
    帕米尔高原上的共产党员为农牧民忘我地工作
    据新华社天津29日电　天津市各级党组织从去年“七一”到今年“七一”前夕，发展了四万一千多名新党员。
    一年来，他们在工业、农业、商业、文教卫生等战线上发挥了积极作用。天津绒毛加工厂的五十八个预备党员中，有四十三人被本厂评为先进生产者，还有两人被评为市的劳动模范。预备党员林德时过去连续几年没有出过废品，入党后工作更加认真，并且积极带动别人，成为全市机械工人中的一面红旗。全总机械厂预备党员王文起，今年以来进行了三十多项技术革新，仅其中较大的一项——“多头钻”实现后就使生产效率提高了二十五倍。西北角街预备党员梁桂荣，今年快六十岁了，解放后，她十年如一日地辛勤地为街道群众办事，关心群众，日常生活勤俭朴素，工作做出了很大成绩。她担任街道生产社的副主任兼储蓄服务站的主任，在她的模范行动带动下，周围居民群众绝大多数参加了储蓄。
    据新华社南京29日电　今年1月到5月，江苏省各地党组织接收了一千六百多名知识分子入党。
    新入党的高级知识分子有：江苏师范学院副院长、苏州市副市长潘慎明，苏州医学院副院长王同观，南京大学历史系主任韩儒林，中国科学院古生物研究所研究员杨敬之，南京永利宁厂总机械师程以德，南京中医院痔科主任丁泽民，江苏省锡剧团著名演员沈佩华等。
    今年入党的知识分子，都经过历次政治运动的考验和各项工作的锻炼，具有较高的共产主义觉悟，许多人并曾经被评为优秀工作者和先进工作者。南京农学院教授李扬汉，在随学校下放农村期间，积极想办法提高教学质量。为了教好植物课，他自己到野外去采集标本，自己动手做实验仪器，自己不懂的就虚心请教老农。他对公社的生产也非常关心，曾主动建议公社搜集当地土生的农药草来防治病虫害。公社采纳了他的建议，发动社员在几天内搜集了一万多斤农药草，解决了30％的麦苗喷药问题。永利宁厂总机械师程以德，解放前就参加这个厂地下党组织领导的互助会、纠察队，进行护厂斗争。解放以后工作一贯积极，经常深入车间同工人、技术人员一道研究解决设备方面的各种问题。常州市第一人民医院外科主治医师高谷深，三年来经他动手的近千次泌尿科手术，从未发生事故。由于高谷深工作积极负责，获得了显著的成绩，三年来连续被评为市级劳动模范，并在1958年得到中央卫生部颁发的奖状和奖章。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐29日电　在帕米尔高原上的塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县的牧场和农业区，党的组织已经普遍建立起来。塔吉克和柯尔克孜等族共产党员，已经成为党密切联系群众、推动农牧业生产的骨干力量。
    塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县是个地区辽阔、人烟稀少的山区，农牧民们散居在五万多平方公里的群山中，交通非常不便。各民族共产党员们为了贯彻党的政策，不避严寒和酷暑，常常骑马翻山越岭，长途跋涉数百里，到边远的农区、牧场向群众进行宣传。
    冰山人民公社今年决定修一条可灌溉两千亩耕地、五千亩牧场的长达二十公里的渠道，公社党委把这个任务交给第三生产大队党支部书记古力胡力（塔吉克族）全面负责。古力胡力虽然不懂修渠工程，当时也没有水利技术员，但是他日夜和群众一起研究修渠的工程计划。在帕米尔高原严寒的冬季，他首先把自己的毡房搬到慕士塔格雪山下的渠道工地上住下。在他的影响下，三大队的群众也纷纷把毡房搬到工地。终于，春耕前就把这条渠道赶修好了。
    今年5月上旬，帕米尔连降大雪，转到高山夏季牧场的牲畜，被大雪封锁在山上。各人民公社党委会、生产大队党支部都召开紧急会议，发动农牧民抢救牲畜，在这场与风雪灾害斗争中，许多共产党员表现了公而忘私的共产主义品质。业尔羌人民公社党委委员马拆欣（塔吉克族）组织了六个人，从一百多公尺高的悬崖绝壁地方爬上山顶，把牧羊人和羊只一个个用绳子吊下来。
    新生人民公社塔吉克族女共产党员固尔来克，领到公社的八十只瘦弱山羊去放牧，许多干部都为她操心，怕这些瘦山羊不能越冬过春，可是由于她精心地饲养，山羊全部安全地度过了春天，并且生了八十只羊羔，成活率仍高达97.5％。
