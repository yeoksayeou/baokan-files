Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th. Commercial departments in Jiangxi are actively breeding and raising pigs themselves, combining their own pig raising with helping the masses raise pigs, purchasing pigs, and guiding pig production. Currently, commercial departments throughout the province have raised more than 80,000 pigs, and commercial departments in many places have already established or are planning to establish pig farms.

The pigs raised by the commercial departments in Jiangxi Province are mainly commodity pigs, but also include an appropriate number of superior breeding pigs for breeding piglets. The benefits of doing this are: commercial departments can regularly maintain a certain number of pig reserves; they can supply the masses with quality piglets, which helps to promote superior breeds and solve part of the pig source problem; they can learn and accumulate experience in pig breeding and management, which facilitates guiding rural pig production. In addition, pigs sold by the masses that do not meet the standards for transfer can also be kept by the commercial departments for fattening. Commercial departments and their affiliated units in various places have a high enthusiasm for raising pigs themselves. Commercial departments in Guixi, Boyang and other counties plan to raise more than 10,000 pigs this year. Because they started quickly and grasped the situation tightly, they have already raised 7,000 pigs. The Chongren County Commercial Bureau and its 12 state-owned stores and purchasing stations have all established pig farms, raising 1,300 meat pigs and breeding pigs. They plant pumpkins in front of and behind their houses, reclaim wasteland to produce vegetables, dig ponds to store water and cultivate water hyacinths, and go up the mountains and down to the water to find wild plants, opening up various sources of pig feed. The first pig breeding and reproduction farm established by the Nankang County Commercial Bureau, led by the bureau chief, raises 77 meat pigs, 57 sows, and 4 superior boars, and has now bred 156 piglets for commune members in nearby people's communes to raise.

While actively developing pig raising, commercial departments in various places are paying attention to studying and trying out advanced breeding and management methods and training technical personnel in breeding and management to better guide the masses in raising pigs. For example, pig farms in the commercial bureaus and purchasing stations of Le'an, Chongren and other counties have established a system of specialized personnel responsible for each pen, experimenting with feeding pigs with silage fermentation feed and sanitary and epidemic prevention management methods, with very good results, and have been taught to the masses.

    江西商业部门养猪
    好处是：能够保持一定生猪储备；可以供应群众良种仔猪；积累生猪饲养管理经验，便于指导农村生猪生产。
    新华社南昌29日电　江西各地商业部门积极自繁自养生猪，把自己养猪和帮助群众养猪、收购生猪和指导生猪生产结合起来。现在全省商业部门自养的生猪已有八万多头，许多地方的商业部门已经办了或正在筹办养猪场。
    江西省商业部门自己饲养的生猪，以商品猪为主，同时适当养一部分优良种猪，用来繁殖仔猪。这样做的好处是：商业部门能够经常保持一定数量的生猪储备；可以供应群众良种仔猪，有助于推广良种和解决部分猪源问题；可以学习和积累生猪饲养管理的经验，便于指导农村生猪生产。此外，对群众交售的尚不合上调规格的猪，还可以由商业部门留下来饲养催肥。各地商业部门和所属单位自养生猪的积极性都很高。贵溪、波阳等县商业部门，计划今年养猪一万多头，由于着手快、抓得紧，现在已经养了七千头。崇仁县商业局及所属十二个国营商店和各个采购站，都已经办起了养猪场，喂养肉猪和种猪一千三百头。他们在屋前屋后种植南瓜，开垦荒地生产蔬菜，挖塘蓄水养殖水浮莲，上山下水找野生植物，多方面地开辟了养猪饲料来源。南康县商业局由局长带头建立的第一个生猪饲养繁殖场，除了养七十七头肉猪以外，还养有五十七头母猪和四头良种公猪，现在已经繁殖了一百五十六头小猪供给附近公社社员饲养。
    各地商业部门在积极发展养猪的同时，都注意研究、试行先进的饲养管理方法，培养饲养管理的技术人员，以便更好地指导群众养猪。如乐安、崇仁等县商业局和采购站的养猪场，都分栏建立起专人负责制，试验用青贮发酵饲料喂猪以及卫生防疫等的饲养管理方法，效果很好，已向群众传授。
