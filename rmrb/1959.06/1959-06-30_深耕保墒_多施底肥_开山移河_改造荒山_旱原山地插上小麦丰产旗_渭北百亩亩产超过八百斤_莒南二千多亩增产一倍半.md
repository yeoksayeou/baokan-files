Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 29th: The Sida Production Team of the Yeshan People's Commune in Dali County, Weibei Arid Plain, Shaanxi Province, has achieved a large-scale wheat harvest on the arid plain. The 101.29 mu of high-yield wheat field of this team, after actual measurement and acceptance, averaged 873.7 jin per mu.

　　The land in this high-yield field was all alkaline soil in the arid plain, with sticky soil and historically very low yields. In response to the characteristics of the arid plain, they first focused on deep ploughing to preserve moisture. They carried out two deep ploughings during the fallow period, each with a depth of eight inches. After ploughing, they harrowed and raked five times continuously to maintain moisture in the soil. During the wheat growing season, they carried out four cultivations and weedings to loosen the soil and preserve moisture. At the same time, last winter, whenever it snowed, they swept the snow from the roads and villages into the fields.

　　In terms of fertilization, combined with the two deep ploughings, base fertilizer was applied twice, about 280 dan per mu. Later, more than 80 dan per mu were applied during the winter to protect the seedlings and increase soil temperature. At the greening stage, 50 dan per mu were applied. At the jointing stage, plant ash was applied to promote strong stems and prevent lodging.

　　In order to overcome the frost in the arid plain, they dug a frost prevention pit next to every two mu of land, with a dedicated person responsible for each pit. When frost appeared in mid-March, they immediately worked day and night to ensure that the wheat safely passed through the frost period. Later, when stripe rust was discovered, they also concentrated on prevention and treatment twice.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 29th: The low-yield wheat situation in the Dashan Brigade of the Dashan People's Commune in Junan County, Shandong, has changed greatly this year. The brigade's 2,020 mu of wheat on mountain thin land has an average yield of 243 jin per mu this year, an increase of 167.6% compared to last year.

　　The predecessor of this brigade was the nationally famous Dashan Agricultural Cooperative. All of the brigade's land is thin mountainous land, and before liberation, the wheat yield was only a few dozen jin per mu. After agricultural cooperativization, under the leadership of the Party, the peasants, relying on collective strength and with the spirit of the foolish old man who removed the mountains, opened up mountains and ridges, moved rivers and changed courses, and launched a tenacious struggle against nature. After several years of struggle, the barren hills have been greened and the floods have been tamed; the barren land has also been transformed into relatively fertile farmland through year-after-year processing.

　　When planting wheat last autumn, the brigade was determined to change the low-yield wheat situation. More than half of the brigade's wheat fields were deep ploughed; combined with deep ploughing, base fertilizer was applied in layers to each mu. All wheat fields were planted with fine varieties such as Bima No. 1, Bima No. 4, and Youzi wheat. New close planting tools such as three-legged cultivators and five-legged cultivators, which the members had never seen before, were used for planting, and reasonable close planting was implemented.

　　In wheat field management, in addition to timely and adequate watering and topdressing, the team also carried out a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters.

    深耕保墒　多施底肥　开山移河　改造荒山
    旱原山地插上小麦丰产旗
    渭北百亩亩产超过八百斤　莒南二千多亩增产一倍半
    据新华社西安29日电　陕西省渭北旱原的大荔县业善人民公社寺田生产队，赢得了旱原小麦大面积丰收。这个队的一百零一亩二分九厘小麦丰产方，经过实打验收，平均亩产八百七十三斤十四两。
    这块丰产方的土地，都是旱原的塿土地，粘性土壤，历年产量很低。针对旱原的特点，他们首先抓住了深耕保墒。在伏期深耕两次，深度各为八寸。耕后又连续耙耱五次，以保持土壤中的水分。在小麦生长期间进行了四次中耕锄草，松土保墒。同时，在去冬每逢下雪就把路上、村中的雪扫到地里。
    在施肥方面，结合两次深翻地先后施底肥两次，每亩约二百八十担。以后，又在越冬时每亩追肥八十多担，保护了幼苗，增加了地温。返青时，每亩追肥五十担。拔节时追施了草木灰，以促进秆壮，防止倒伏。
    为了战胜旱原的霜冻，他们在每两亩地旁边挖一个防霜坑，每坑有一个专人负责，3月中旬出现霜冻时，立即日夜苦战，使小麦安全度过霜冻期。以后发现条锈病，又集中防治了两次。
    据新华社济南29日电　山东莒南县大山人民公社大山大队小麦低产面貌今年有了很大改变。全队在山岭薄地上的二千零二十亩小麦，今年平均亩产二百四十三斤，比去年增加了167.6％。
    这个大队的前身，就是全国闻名的大山农业社。全队的土地都是山岭薄地，解放前麦子亩产不过几十斤。农业合作化以后，农民们在党的领导下，依靠集体力量，以愚公移山的精神，开山劈岭，移河改道，向大自然展开了顽强的斗争。经过几年的奋斗，荒山绿化了，洪水驯服了；瘠薄的土地经过年复一年的加工，也变成了比较肥沃的农田。
    这个大队在去年秋天种麦时，就立志要改变小麦低产面貌。全队的麦地有一半以上实行了深翻；结合深翻，每亩分层施了底肥。全部麦田，都是播的碧蚂一号、碧蚂四号和蚰子麦等良种，播种时使用了过去社员们没见过的三脚耧、五脚耧等新的密植工具，实行了合理密植。
    这个队在麦田管理中，除了适时、适量浇水、追肥以外，还同各种自然灾害展开了顽强的斗争。
