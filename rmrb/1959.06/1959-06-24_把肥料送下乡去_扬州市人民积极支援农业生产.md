Sending Fertilizer to the Countryside
    The People of Yangzhou Actively Support Agricultural Production
    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd) The people of Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, focusing on the accumulation and delivery of fertilizer to the countryside, have once again launched a high tide of support for rural areas. From May to June 15, the city accumulated more than 310 million jin of fertilizer, dispatched more than 560,000 person-times, and has already sent more than 230 million jin of fertilizer to the countryside.
    Since the beginning of this year, Yangzhou has twice carried out a concentrated movement to accumulate and deliver fertilizer to the countryside, which has strongly supported agricultural production in the suburbs. Before the comprehensive summer harvest and summer planting, the Municipal Party Committee decided to launch another concentrated effort in May to accumulate and deliver 200 million jin of fertilizer to the suburban people's communes as base fertilizer for summer planting and top dressing for spring fields and vegetable fields. At the same time, it required the people of the city to accumulate a total of 1 billion jin of fertilizer and send it to the countryside by the end of December. Without affecting daily production, work, and study, each unit stipulated different times for accumulating and delivering fertilizer according to different circumstances. In terms of accumulating and delivering fertilizer, residents, workers, and middle school students mainly combined the patriotic health movement to send weeds, garbage, and ditch mud cleaned from inside and outside the city to nearby communes. Government cadres, financial and trade personnel, school and hospital staff, during working hours, went to nearby communes to dig small, deep pits to accumulate fertilizer on the spot.
    Due to the strong support of the urban people, the enthusiasm of the suburban farmers for production has become even higher.

    把肥料送下乡去
    扬州市人民积极支援农业生产
    本报南京23日电　江苏扬州市人民围绕积肥送肥下乡活动，再次掀起支援农村热潮。从5月到6月15日，全市共积肥三亿一千余万斤，出动五十六万余人次，已送肥下乡二亿三千多万斤。
    扬州市今年以来曾两次开展积肥送肥下乡突击运动，有力地支持了郊区的农业生产。夏收夏种全面展开前，市委确定在5月份再突击积送肥料两亿斤给郊区人民公社，作为夏种基肥和春田、菜田追肥；同时要求全市人民到12月底止，共积十亿斤肥料送下乡。在不影响日常生产、工作、学习前提下，各单位根据不同情况规定了不同的积肥送肥时间。在积肥送肥方法上，居民、工人、中学学生，主要结合爱国卫生运动，把城内外清扫出来的杂草、垃圾、阴沟泥，送到附近的公社；机关干部、财贸人员，学校、医院职工，在劳动时间内，到稍远的公社就地挖小口深塘积肥。
    由于城市人民的有力支援，郊区农民生产积极性更加高涨。
