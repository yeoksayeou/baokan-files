    A Trip to Shannan
    Hu Guocheng
    In mid-May, I accompanied several responsible comrades from the CPC Tibet Work Committee, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to the Shannan region of Tibet. We departed from Lhasa, passed through Quxu and Zedang, and arrived at Longzi County, covering a round trip of more than 700 kilometers. The following are my observations and experiences from this trip to the Shannan region. From Lhasa to Longzi County
    The Shannan region, as we generally refer to it, is the vast rectangular area south of the Gangdise Mountains in southeastern Lhasa. It borders the Tagong region to the east, the Jiangzi region to the west, and extends south to the borders of Bhutan and India.
    From Gongga County to Zedang, the ancient city of Tibet, our car traveled along the narrow strip of land on the south bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The climate is mild and the land is fertile in this area. It is said that during the flood season, one can conveniently travel down this section of the river on unique Tibetan yak-hide boats.
    From Zedang to Longzi County in the southeast, the road winds through narrow valleys and ridges between continuous mountain ranges, some peaks reaching altitudes of 5,000 to 6,000 meters above sea level. This area is rich in mineral resources. Nearby are what Tibetan compatriots call "Apa Serre" (Gold Father Mountain) and "Ama Ere" (Silver Mother Mountain), said to contain gold, silver, and sulfur. The Zhaqi Serre Mountain also produces precious medicinal materials such as antlers and musk. Along the way, we saw mica-containing minerals glistening on the nearby hillsides. The valleys are full of excellent crops and natural pastures. The streams in steep mountain areas also represent an inexhaustible source of hydropower that can be developed.
    The Shannan region has always been known as the "granary of Tibet." The yield per unit area of land here is one to two times higher than in other parts of Tibet. In addition to supplying nearby areas, merchants from the Heihe and Thirty-Nine Clan regions also bring salt and other goods here every year in exchange for grain. Along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, we saw that the robust highland barley seedlings had already grown three or four inches high, and the farmers were working in groups to weed and irrigate the fields. Near Longzi County, although the sowing season was several weeks later than in the northern Shannan region, the verdant seedlings looked like a prairie from afar, and occasionally we could see yaks plowing the fields, followed by women sowing seeds. This year, the Shannan Military Control Commission has issued a large number of interest-free agricultural loans to poor farmers and announced that whoever cultivates the land of the rebels will reap the harvest, so farmers are highly enthusiastic about cultivation. Many abandoned lands have been replanted with highland barley.
    Zedang is a famous textile handicraft city in Tibet, where the people can weave high-quality woolen fabrics. From Gongga County to Longzi County, many beautiful temple buildings standing on the tops and slopes of the mountains were built by the working people of Shannan under very difficult material conditions. The brightly colored murals in the temples were also painted by Tibetan craftsmen using some local mineral pigments.
    The Shannan region is almost equal in area to one-third of Zhejiang Province, but the population is only about 170,000. The favorable conditions of abundant resources and sparse population have not brought any happiness to the people of Shannan. On the contrary, it has become an excuse for the great feudal lords to more cruelly exploit the serfs. Along the way, we saw many Tibetans scantily clad, and we also saw many houses turned into ruins. Tibetan compatriots told us that many poor farmers here were heavily indebted under the heavy exploitation of the serf owners and were forced to flee to other places.
    In addition to the cruel exploitation and oppression of the great feudal lords, the people of Shannan have also suffered the bloody devastation of the rebels. When the rebels were entrenched here, the entire Shannan became a death valley more terrible than hell. The rebels forced the people here to hand over grain and grass. In Zhegu County, a manor with more than 200 households, the rebels forcibly seized 5,000 kilograms of grain, 2,000 kilograms of butter, and 200 cattle, as well as many horses and fodder. Poor farmers who could not hand it over were whipped or even shot. In Qude Gong, Awang Shenzhu, the former secretary of the county government, told us that the rebels, because they could not grab food, killed an innocent farmer named Dorje Bazhen with the "crime" of "having illicit relations with the Han people," and placed the body of this innocent person on the Xiangbo Bridge, a key transportation route from Qude Gong to Zedang, to intimidate other local farmers. The rebels robbed everywhere, even stealing children's diapers. The rebels' crimes of raping women were even more outrageous. In Zhaqi Nazi, about 30 kilometers from Zedang, all 170 women in the village, regardless of age, were raped by the rebels. Therefore, the people of Shannan hated the rebels to the core.

      In Zedang
    Zedang, the political, economic, and cultural center of the Shannan region, is located on a plateau at an altitude of 3,400 meters. In May here, sometimes three feet of dust can suddenly rise from the ground, making it impossible to see oncoming vehicles; after a rainstorm, the mountain tops will be covered with a thin layer of white snow. But on sunny days, the scenery here is similar to that of villages in the deep mountains of Jiangnan.
    After arriving in Zedang, we lived in a row of low bungalows surrounded by mountains on three sides at the CPC Shannan Sub-Work Committee. We found these bungalows covered with bullet marks. The responsible comrade of the CPC Shannan Sub-Work Committee told us that the rebels, who had been entrenched here since August last year under the instigation of the former Tibetan local government, relied on their superior forces and the commanding terrain to launch three fierce attacks on the central government agencies and the People's Liberation Army garrison stationed here. At that time, the People's Liberation Army only carried out active defense and did not attack, while reporting to the central government to promote the former Tibetan local government to maintain law and order. The central government patiently waited for the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet to come to their senses, but the rebels considered them "weak and easy to bully." From January 25 this year, the rebels gathered a large number of troops and surrounded our Zedang agencies and troops, frantically launching multiple fierce attacks on us. What is most outrageous is that when the rebels could not break into our residence, they forced the residents here to dig fortifications, transport ammunition, dig tunnels, and even point their guns at the tearful residents, asking them to act as cover for their attacks.
    This responsible comrade said that during this period, we could only live in underground caves. When we lacked drinking water, we could only rush out to fetch water at night, and many comrades sacrificed their lives because of this. But the rebels' conspiracy did not succeed. We persisted for seventy-four days and nights. Finally, the rebel leaders openly launched an armed rebellion in Lhasa. We received the State Council's order to quell the rebellion and, with the support of the local people, quickly restored peace and order in Zedang.
    After the People's Liberation Army was ordered to quell the rebellion, it took only about ten days to wipe out the bandit nests in Shannan.
    In the process of quelling the rebellion, the People's Liberation Army resolutely implemented the Party's ethnic policies, religious policies, and "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and was therefore deeply loved by the Tibetan compatriots. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in addition to resolutely completing the task of quelling the rebellion, spent half a day each day helping the masses plow the fields, turn the land, and deliver manure. The soldiers also helped Zedang residents repair houses, repair canals, and even give haircuts to the residents and sew new clothes for newborn Tibetan babies. The hospital of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army often organized medical teams to treat Tibetan compatriots nearby and set up a medical staff training class to train their own doctors for the Tibetan compatriots. The Tibetan compatriots, in order to thank them for this enthusiastic help, sent milk and eggs to the soldiers. When the soldiers explained the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" to the Tibetan compatriots, the Tibetan compatriots said: "You are our saviors. How can we feel good if you don't eat our things?"
    Many Tibetan compatriots actively assisted the People's Liberation Army in capturing rebels. A poor herdsman in his fifties named Zaxi walked more than 50 kilometers of mountain roads from Juela Xika in southern Longzi County to the驻地驻地 of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and reported that thirteen rebels were hiding in a dilapidated temple near his home. The next morning, when the troops set off to capture the rebels, the old man, although exhausted, still insisted on guiding the troops. After the troops surrounded the dilapidated temple, Zaxi shouted loudly to the temple: "The People's Liberation Army will not kill those who surrender their guns." As a result, our army captured all the rebels without firing a single bullet.

        Two Soldiers
    In the battle in which the People's Liberation Army victoriously wiped out the bandit nests in Shannan, there were heroic deeds of two soldiers annihilating nearly a hundred bandits. These two resourceful and courageous soldiers, one named Zhou Shirong, is twenty-three years old this year and a member of the Communist Youth League; the other named Yan Yuyun, is only twenty years old this year and a new recruit who has been in the army for less than a year.
    In early April, the high mountains in Shannan were still covered with snow. They followed the troops from Lhasa, crossed the Yarlung Tsangpo River, crossed mountains and ridges, and pursued the rebels who had been harming the people of Shannan for a long time. Eight or nine days of marching made their feet blister with several large blisters. They endured the pain and resolutely followed the troops over the Qilila Snow Mountain, which is more than 5,000 meters above sea level. When they were walking down the mountain through a gravelly area, fine sand got into the blisters on their soles. Every step they took felt like a knife was cutting them. Slowly, they fell behind the main force.
    At noon on April 17, they walked to a narrow mountain ditch eight miles south of Luoxue and suddenly found a group of rebels riding horses coming from a mountain road hundreds of meters ahead. This group of rebels seemed to number about one hundred. They immediately occupied favorable hillsides on both sides of the path separately, creating a crossfire network from above. At this time, they forgot their fatigue and the pain in their feet, quickly opened the safety cover of the grenade, and aimed at the oncoming enemy with submachine guns.
    They waited calmly for the rebels who were slowly forming a column. When the rebels were only about one hundred meters away from them, Zhou Shirong first pulled the machine of his submachine gun, killing the leading bandit leader, and the remaining rebels suddenly panicked. In panic, a bandit leader hurriedly raised a large呢帽呢帽 and shouted in Chinese that he was willing to surrender. When the bandit leader heard Zhou Shirong shout in Tibetan: "Menda Zhana Sai Ge Mei!" (Surrender and don't kill) "Cun Dan Maji Na Menda Jia Ge Yin Da!" (If you are not honest, we will shoot) he obediently ordered his men to dismount and surrender according to Zhou Shirong's command.
    The bandit leader raised his hands and walked alone behind the small hillside where Zhou Shirong was hiding. This bandit leader, with a full beard and a scar on his neck, tried to bribe them with a gold watch after discovering that there were only two People's Liberation Army soldiers. After being sternly rejected by Zhou Shirong and the other, the bandit leader handed over his gun and knife while shamelessly saying: "I have long heard of the People's Liberation Army's Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention."
    After a while, the bandit leader tried to inquire about the truth from Yan Yuyun, asking, "Are there only two of you? Are there any troops around you?" At this time, Zhou Shirong, who was monitoring dozens of bandits in front, said to the bandit leader: "We have a lot of troops, and they will be over soon." At the same time, he explained to the bandit leader our army's determination to thoroughly eliminate the rebels and the policy on captives. It was not until Zhou Shirong asked Yan Yuyun to tie the bandit leader's hands behind his back that the bandit leader gave up. This bandit leader also confessed that his name was Jiaying Zangwang, and the group of rebels he led belonged to the Enshu Cang bandit gang.
    After the bandit leader surrendered, Zhou Shirong and Yan Yuyun began to search every bandit for weapons and ammunition. They called the bandits to the side to search them, one by one, and it took them more than three hours to search all the rebels. During the search, individual bandits tried to hide the small knives or bullets they were carrying, but they could not escape their clever eyes. Every murder weapon of the bandits was searched out. They counted the spoils: ninety-six enemies captured, thirty long and short guns, fourteen flintlocks, six hundred and thirty-nine bullets, seventy-six large and small knives, and ninety-five war horses.
    They calmly ate Zanba with the captives, and it was about six o'clock in the afternoon after they finished eating. They left the captured bandits behind, asking them to stay where they were and wait for the People's Liberation Army to escort them. They first escorted Jiaying Zangwang and another bandit leader and seven horses carrying the spoils to find their troops.
    Late that night, they finally found their troops. Their heroic behavior was warmly praised by the leaders and comrades. The next morning, the troop leaders sent some other people to escort a bandit leader to escort back those bandits who had surrendered their guns. As Zhou Shirong expected, the bandits were all waiting in place, and not one was missing.

    山南行
    胡国城
    5月中旬，我随中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹委会和人民解放军西藏军区的几位负责同志，到西藏山南地区去。我们从拉萨出发，经过曲水、泽当到达隆子宗，来回行程共约七百多公里。下面所记的，就是这次去山南地区的点滴见闻。从拉萨到隆子宗
    通常我们所指的山南地区，是指拉萨东南部冈蒂斯山以南的长方形的辽阔地区。它的东部和塔工地区相接，西部和江孜地区为邻，南部一直伸展到不丹和印度边境。
    从贡嘎宗到西藏的古城泽当，我们的汽车一直沿着雅鲁藏布江南岸的狭长地带行驶。这一带气候温和，土地肥沃。据说如果在汛期，在这一段江面上还可以坐西藏特有的牛皮船顺流而下，十分方便。
    从泽当向东南到隆子宗，道路蜿蜒在山峦绵亘的狭谷和山脊上，有的山峰高达海拔五、六千公尺以上。这里蕴藏着丰富的矿产。附近有藏胞所称的“阿爸赛热”（金父山）和“阿玛厄热”（银母山）两座山，据说那里蕴藏有金、银和硫磺等。在扎其热山上，还出产像鹿茸、麝香等珍贵药材。途中，我们曾看到含有云母片的矿石在附近的山坡上闪闪发光。山谷中，到处是良好的庄稼和天然的牧场。山势陡峭处的溪流，更是可供开发的无穷尽的水力资源。
    山南地区素来被人们称为西藏的粮仓。这里的土地单位面积产量比西藏其他地区要高出一、二倍，出产的粮食除了供应附近地区外，黑河地区和三十九族地区的商人，每年也运盐巴和其他货物来这里换取粮食。在雅鲁藏布江沿岸，我们看到茁壮的青稞苗已经长出三、四寸高了，农民们正成群结队地在地里除草和引水灌溉。靠近隆子宗一带，虽然播种季节比山南北部地区要迟几个星期，但绿油油的禾苗，远远望去也已像一片草原，间或还可以看到正在犁地的牦牛，后面跟着撒种的妇女。由于今年山南军管会给贫苦农民发放了大量无息农贷，并宣布对叛匪的土地实行谁种谁收，因此农民们耕种热情十分高涨。许多荒芜了的土地又重新种上了青稞。
    泽当是西藏著名的纺织手工业城市，这里的人民能够织出上等的毛哔叽。从贡嘎宗到隆子宗，许多屹立在山顶和山腰上的美丽的寺庙建筑物，是山南劳动人民用双手在十分困难的物质条件下建造起来的。寺庙中色调鲜艳的壁画，也是西藏的工匠们采用部分当地矿质颜料描绘出来的。
    山南地区的面积几乎等于浙江省的三分之一，但是人口却只有十七万左右。物产丰富和地广人稀的有利条件，没有替山南人民带来任何幸福，相反地却成了大领主更加残酷地剥削农奴的借口。一路上，我们看到许多藏胞衣不蔽体，还看到许多房屋变成了废墟。藏胞们告诉我们，这里不少贫苦农民在农奴主的重重剥削下，负债累累，被迫逃往他乡。
    除了大领主的残酷剥削压迫外，山南人民还受尽了叛匪的血腥摧残。当叛匪盘踞在这里的时候，整个山南变成了比地狱还可怕的死亡谷。叛匪们强迫这里的人民交粮交草，仅哲古宗一个二百多户的庄园，叛匪就强征去了五千克粮食、二千克酥油、二百头牛，还有许多马匹和草料。贫苦农民交不出来，就遭到鞭打，甚至遭到枪杀。在曲得共，前宗政府秘书阿旺深珠对我们说，叛匪因抢不到粮食，曾以
  “私通汉人”的“罪”名杀死了一个名叫多吉把真的无辜的农民，并将这个无辜者的尸体安放在由曲得共到泽当交通要道的香波桥上，以此来威吓当地其他农民。叛匪们到处抢劫，甚至连小孩的尿布也被抢去。叛匪奸淫妇女的罪行更是令人发指。在离泽当约三十公里的扎其那子，全村一百七十名妇女，不分老幼全部遭到了叛匪的蹂躏。因此山南人民对叛匪无不痛恨入骨。
      在泽当
    山南地区政治、经济和文化中心的泽当，座落在海拔三千四百公尺的高原上。这里的5月，有时会突然平地起土三尺，望不见迎面驶来的车辆；一阵风雨之后，山头上又会蒙上一层薄薄的白雪。可是在风和日丽的日子，这里却和江南深山里的村庄有着类似的风光。
    我们到泽当后，住在中共山南分工委的一排三面靠山的矮平房里。我们发现这些平房周围墙壁上弹痕累累。中共山南分工委的负责同志告诉我们，从去年8月开始盘踞在这里的叛匪就在原西藏地方政府的指使下，依仗优势兵力和居高临下的地形，先后向中央驻在这里的机关和人民解放军驻军发动了三次猛烈的进攻。当时人民解放军只是进行积极的防御，不予出击，一面报告中央促进原西藏地方政府来维持治安。中央耐心等待西藏上层反动集团醒悟，不料却被叛匪们认为是“软弱可欺”。从今年1月25日起，叛匪更集结了大量兵力，把我驻泽当机关、部队团团围住，猖狂地向我们发动多次的猛烈进攻。最令人发指的是叛匪在无法攻破我们住所的时候，竟驱使这里的居民挖工事、运弹药、挖地道，甚至把枪口对准满脸泪痕的居民，要居民们充当他们进攻的掩护。
    这位负责同志说，在这个期间，我们只能住在地洞里。缺乏饮水时，也只能在夜间冲出去挑水，有不少同志就因此牺牲了。但叛匪的阴谋没有得逞。我们坚持了七十四个昼夜，最后叛乱头子在拉萨公然发动武装叛乱，我们接到了国务院平息叛乱的命令，在当地人民的支持下，很快就使泽当恢复了和平秩序。
    人民解放军奉命平叛后，仅短短十天左右时间，就一举荡平了山南的匪巢。
    人民解放军在平叛过程中，坚决执行着党的民族政策、宗教政策以及“三大纪律、八项注意”，因此受到藏族同胞的衷心爱戴。人民解放军某部官兵，除了坚决完成平乱任务外，每人每天都抽出半天时间来帮助群众犁田，翻地，送粪。战士们还帮助泽当居民修房屋，修水渠，甚至给居民理发，给藏胞新生婴儿缝新衣。解放军某部医院经常组织医疗队到附近为藏胞治病，并开办了一个医务人员训练班，为藏胞训练自己的医生。藏胞们为了答谢这种热情的帮助，把牛奶、鸡蛋送给战士们吃。当战士们向藏胞解释“三大纪律、八项注意”时，藏胞们却说：“你们是我们的救命恩人，不吃我们的东西我们怎么能过意得去呢？”
    许多藏胞积极协助人民解放军捕捉叛匪。有一个五十多岁的名叫扎西的穷苦牧民，曾从隆子宗南部觉拉溪卡走了五十多公里山路来到人民解放军某部驻地，报告说有十三个叛匪躲藏在他家附近的破庙里。第二天早晨部队出发去捕捉叛匪时，这位老人虽然已经疲乏不堪，但他仍坚持要给部队作向导。部队包围了破庙以后，扎西又大声向庙里喊道：“解放军对缴枪投降的不杀。”结果，我军不费一粒子弹就全部俘虏了这批叛匪。
        两个战士
    在人民解放军胜利荡平山南匪巢的战役中，曾出现了两名战士歼匪近百名的英雄事迹。这两名智勇双全的战士，一个叫周士荣，今年二十三岁，是个共青团员；另一个叫严玉运，今年才二十岁，是个入伍还不到一年的新兵。
    4月上旬，山南的高山上还积着雪。他俩随着部队从拉萨出发，渡过雅鲁藏布江，翻山越岭，追击长期危害着山南人民的叛匪。一连八、九天的急行军，使他们的双脚磨起了好几个大水泡，他们忍着痛，坚强地随着部队翻越了拔海五千多公尺高的启里拉雪山。当他们穿过一片砂砾地向山下行进时，细砂钻入了他们脚板上的水泡，每跨一步，就像刀割般地疼痛，慢慢地，他俩掉在大队的后面了。
    4月17日中午，他俩走到洛雪以南八里地的一条狭长山沟里，突然发现前方数百公尺的山道上来了一股骑马的叛匪。这股叛匪看来有一百人左右。他俩立即分头在小道两侧占领了有利的小山坡，居高临下，组成了交叉的火力网。这时他们忘记了疲劳，也忘记了脚上的阵痛，迅速掀开手榴弹的保险盖，用冲锋枪瞄准着迎上前来的敌人。
    他俩沉着地守候着慢慢形成一路纵队前进的叛匪。等到叛匪距离他俩只有一百公尺左右的时候，周士荣首先拨动冲锋枪的机钮，击毙带队的匪首，剩下的叛匪顿时慌乱起来。一个匪首在惊慌之余，急忙举起大呢帽摇晃，用汉话叫喊愿意投降。当匪首听到周士荣用藏话高喊：“门达扎那赛格美！”（缴枪不杀）“村丹马吉那门达佳格因达！”（不老老实实就开枪）后，他就遵照周士荣的指挥，乖乖地命令他的部下下马投降。
    匪首高举双手独自走到周士荣隐身的小山坡后面。这个满腮胡子、颈项上还有一道伤痕的匪首，在发现只有两个解放军战士后，就企图用金手表来贿赂。在遭到了周士荣他俩的严词拒绝以后，匪首才一边缴枪、缴刀，一边厚颜无耻地说：“我早已听说过人民解放军的三大纪律、八项注意。”
    过一会儿，那个匪首又企图向严玉运探听虚实，他问：“你们只有两个人么？你们周围还有部队没有？”这时正在监视着前方几十个匪徒的周士荣就对匪首说：“我们部队多得很，他们很快就会过来。”同时向匪首说明我军彻底肃清叛匪的决心和俘虏政策。直到周士荣叫严玉运把匪首双手反绑起来后，匪首才死下心来。这个匪首还供认，他名叫甲英藏旺，他率领的这股叛匪是属于恩殊仓匪部的。
    匪首降服后，周士荣和严玉运便开始搜查每一个匪徒身边的武器弹药。他们把匪徒叫到一边搜查，叫一个搜查一个，足足费了三个多小时才搜完了所有的叛匪。在搜查中，个别匪徒还企图隐藏身边所带的小刀或子弹，但是躲不过他俩机灵的眼睛，匪徒们每一件杀人武器都被搜查出来了。他们清点了一下战利品：俘敌九十六名，长短枪三十支，火药枪十四支，子弹六百三十九发、大小刀七十六把和战马九十五匹。
    他俩从容不迫地和俘虏们一起吃糌粑，吃完后已经到了下午六时左右。他俩把俘虏的匪徒们留下来，要他们耽在原地不动，等候人民解放军来押他们。他俩先押着甲英藏旺和另一个匪首及驮着战利品的七匹马，前去找自己的部队。
    当天深夜，他俩终于找到了自己的部队。他俩的英雄行为受到了首长和同志们的热烈赞扬。第二天早晨，部队首长另派一些人押着一名匪首去押回那些缴了枪的匪徒。这些匪徒不出周士荣所料，个个在原地等候着，一个也没有少。
