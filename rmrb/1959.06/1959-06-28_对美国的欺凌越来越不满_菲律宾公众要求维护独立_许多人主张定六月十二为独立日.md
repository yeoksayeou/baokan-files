    Increasingly Dissatisfied with American Bullying
    Philippine Public Demands Maintenance of Independence
    Many Advocate Setting June 12th as Independence Day
    (Reported by this newspaper) The contradictions between the Philippines and the United States continue to develop. Philippine public opinion is constantly voicing calls for maintaining national independence and breaking away from American control.

    On June 12th, the province of Cavite in the Philippines held a ceremony to commemorate the sixty-first anniversary of the Philippines' declaration of independence from Spain. Participants included General Aguinaldo, the first president of the Philippine Republic (1898-1901), as well as approximately three thousand veterans who participated in the two wars against Spanish and American aggression against the Philippines. Senator Recto condemned the United States at the meeting for undermining Philippine independence through deceptive means. He traced how the United States deceived Aguinaldo, causing the Filipinos to be invaded by the United States when they were about to get rid of Spanish rule, leading to the first war between Filipinos and American troops. He also pointed out that the so-called independence granted to the Philippines by the United States on July 4, 1946, was nothing more than a "farce." Colonel Benancio, chairman of the Philippine National Progressive Movement, on the eve of this anniversary, demanded that June 12th be designated as the official Independence Day of the Philippines, rather than July 4th. He said: "Choosing June 12th as the official Independence Day should be recorded in the Philippine Declaration of Independence to affirm that the United States did not grant independence to the Philippines." On June 23rd, Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano, speaking at the annual meeting of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, also said that the Philippines' independence in 1946 did not receive the kind of respect it expected from other Asian countries. "Due to the faults of our own people and the United States, a very wrong impression prevails among people in Asia and Europe that despite gaining freedom, we are still practically a colony of the United States." He further pointed out that, in view of this situation, the Philippines is determined to reaffirm its independence from the United States. Philippine President Garcia also emphasized in a recent speech that Philippine nationalism "seeks to break free from the shackles of colonial thinking and seeks freedom to determine the fate of the country." Philippine Ambassador to the United States Romulo warned in a conversation on June 20 that the friendly relations between the United States and the Philippines are being tested. He also euphemistically explained that the domestic sentiment in the Philippines "is not anti-American," but rather "rising up to show the world that we are not puppets."

    At this time, Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano, the chief representative of the Philippine side in the negotiations, revealed that the negotiations between the Philippines and the United States to revise the base agreement are still in a "stalemate." This greatly angered the broad public opinion in the Philippines, including many politicians. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives is considering a proposal to abolish the US-Philippine military base agreement. Mitra, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee believe that abolishing the base agreement is the "only appropriate and decent" way for the Philippines to take, should the current exploratory negotiations between the Philippine Foreign Minister and the United States stall again. Recently, the widely circulated "Manila Chronicle" demanded that Congress declare US military bases a threat to Philippine national sovereignty. The newspaper said: "Let us do our best to expose the hypocrisy of American policy towards the Philippines and tell the world that the fundamental purpose of the United States here... is to use its bases to maintain its suzerainty over our country forever."

    对美国的欺凌越来越不满
    菲律宾公众要求维护独立
    许多人主张定六月十二为独立日
    本报讯　目前菲律宾和美国之间的矛盾仍在继续发展着。菲律宾公众舆论不断发出维护民族独立、摆脱美国控制的呼声。
    6月12日菲律宾甲米地省举行了纪念菲律宾宣布脱离西班牙而独立的六十一周年庆祝典礼。参加这个典礼的有菲律宾共和国第一任总统（1898—1901年）的阿吉纳多将军以及参加过反对西班牙和美国两次侵菲战争的约三千名老战士。参议员雷克托在会上谴责美国以欺骗手段破坏了菲律宾的独立。他追溯美国如何地欺骗阿吉纳多，使菲律宾人在将要摆脱西班牙统治的时候受到美国的侵略，导致菲律宾人同美国军队发生第一次战争。他并指出，美国在1946年7月4日给予菲律宾的所谓独立，不过是一出“笑剧”。菲律宾民族进步运动主席贝南西奥上校在这个纪念日的前夕，要求把6月12日定为菲律宾正式的独立日，而不要把7月4日作为独立日。他说：“选择6月12日作为正式的独立日，这一点应当记载在菲律宾的独立宣言中，以肯定美国并没有给予菲律宾以独立”。6月23日，菲律宾外交部长塞兰诺，在妇女俱乐部总联合会的年会上发表讲话时也说：菲律宾在1946年的独立并没有得到期望从其他亚洲国家得到的那种尊重。“由于我们自己人民的及美国的过错，在亚洲和欧洲人士中流行着一种极其错误的印象，认为尽管我们获得了自由，我们实际上仍然是美国的殖民地。”他并且指出，鉴于这种情况，菲律宾决心重新肯定它对美国的独立地位。菲律宾总统加西亚也在不久前的一次讲话中强调菲律宾民族主义“设法摆脱殖民思想的束缚，并且寻求自由以决定国家的命运”。菲律宾驻美大使罗慕洛在6月20日的一次谈话中警告说，美菲的友好关系正在受到考验。他并且委婉地解释说，菲律宾国内的情绪“并不是反美”，而是“起来向全世界显示我们并不是傀儡。”
    在这时候，据菲律宾外交部长、菲方参加谈判的首席代表塞兰诺透露，菲美修改基地协定的谈判至今仍“继续存在着僵局”。这大大激怒了包括许多政界人士在内的菲律宾广大公众舆论。菲律宾众议院外委会正在考虑一项要求废除菲美军事基地协定的提案。外委会主席米特拉说，外委会的委员们认为废除基地协定是菲律宾应采取的“唯一适当和体面”的办法，如果目前菲律宾外长要同美国进行的探讨性谈判再次僵持起来的话。最近，销路很广的“马尼拉纪事报”，曾要求国会宣称美国军事基地是对菲律宾国家主权的威胁。这家报纸说：“让我们尽力揭露美国对菲律宾政策的伪善性，告诉全世界，美国在这里的根本目的……是要利用它的基地以使永远保持它对我国的宗主权。”
