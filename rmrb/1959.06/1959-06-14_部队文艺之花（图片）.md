Blossoms of Art from the Troops
    Inscription for the Generals' Chorus (Two Quatrains)
    Xiao Xiangrong
        (I)
    The Generals' Chorus brings fresh faces and joy,
    Discussing martial prowess and literary talent, a rare breed.
    Today's leading figures are flourishing,
    Surpassing Yuntai Pavilion in the annals of millennia.
        (II)
    A performance on the stage, astounding the audience,
    The heroic singing reverberates around the beams.
    Looking back at thirty years of paths through a hail of bullets,
    Countless heads were tossed lightly. (With picture)
    Generals' Chorus
    The Joy of Initial Victory
    Beat the war drums and repel the enemy!
    The dance drama "Five Red Clouds," performed by the Guangzhou Military Region Soldiers' Song and Dance Troupe, praises the struggle and liberation of the Li people under the leadership of the Party. (Sketch by Li Keyu)
    "Old Appearance" points to a gray cloud on the northwestern horizon, telling the army commander and political commissar: "The northeast wind is coming!" The northeast wind is the signal to cross the sea to Hainan Island in wooden boats.
    Always Pay Attention to the Enemy's Actions (The "Hainan War Song" performed by the Guangzhou Military Region Soldiers' Drama Troupe)
    Poetry Recitation "Remembering General Yang Jingyu" (Performed by amateur actors from the Shenyang Military Region)

    将军合唱面生开，论武修文旷世才。
    今日风流人物盛，千年册史胜云台。
          （二）
    一现前台满座惊，歌声豪壮绕梁行。
    回头卅载枪林路，无限头颅竞掷轻。（附图片）
