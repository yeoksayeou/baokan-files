    Today's Liangshan
    By our reporters Hu Lei, Zhao Fu

    The entire Party and people of Liangshan County, Shandong Province, are engaged in a wheat harvesting battle as urgent and fiery as the wind, advancing at a rate of 100,000 mu of harvested land per day.

    This place is where the heroes of Liangshan gathered in the past. Last year's wheat harvest was bountiful, and this year's over 700,000 mu of wheat is several times better than last year! The stalks are as high as the chest, and the ears are as uniformly neat as if cut with a knife. The 200,000 mu of high-yield wheat are so dense that an average person can barely be seen inside. Standing on the summit of Liangshan Mountain and looking into the distance, the former large and small water bodies of Liangshan, covering an area of more than 100 li, have now turned into a golden sea of wheat. Countless harvesting armies are rolling in this ocean of golden waves. They are wielding scythes and pitchforks, day and night, in a rush to harvest.

    Liangshan County is divided into two types of areas: inside and outside the lake. Of the 700,000 mu of wheat, more than 400,000 mu are in the lake area. The lake area has a small population and abundant land. Before communization, the wheat planted was both scarce and of poor quality, and it often suffered from water damage. This year, the wheat planted is both plentiful and of high quality. However, the wheat harvesting period coincides with the arrival of the flood season, making it a very arduous task for the people of this area to ensure that every grain is brought into the granary. The Party committees at the provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels all attach particular importance to the harvesting of large areas of wheat fields in the lake area. The county committee has set up a frontline command post in Shanglaozhuang, with Secretary Guo Zhen personally in charge. In addition, a large number of leading cadres from the county and commune have been transferred to the production teams to divide the work into specific areas and blocks, and to take responsibility for leading the harvesting. The propaganda forces have also been mobilized to serve the wheat harvest. On June 7, as the battle was just beginning, Minister Yang of the prefectural committee's Rural Work Department came to help. On the same day, Zhang Kai, chairman of the provincial women's federation, and Gao Wende, the first secretary of the county committee, also arrived.

    In the lake depression area, seventy li from north to south and forty li from east to west, people are everywhere, and red flags are fluttering in the wind. On the threshing grounds, the rumbling threshing machines are rotating non-stop, and trucks, horse-drawn carts, and human-powered vehicles are rushing to transport wheat on the roads day and night. Cadres from government offices, workers, students, fishermen, actors, field delivery teams, mobile medical teams, motor transport teams, support teams from other communes, and local commune members, a total of ten teams, have deployed themselves in a competition formation. The dike repair professional team from the Dakou Management District, which was transferred back from the Yellow River, joined the battle the next day. This strong team worked in the lake depression for half a month during the autumn wheat planting season and was rated as a red banner team. This time, they camped in that wheat field again. The old model worker Wang Jiande is a well-known wheat-cutting expert, already fifty years old. Look at him grabbing the wheat with his left hand and waving the sickle with his right, rushing ahead of everyone in one breath. "Old Huang Zhong" Lü Xingshi tightened his belt and chased after him closely. The young men were even more unwilling to be outdone, and a competition between groups and individuals was immediately launched. Southwest of Shanglaozhuang, shouts of "Chase after them! Compete not only for speed but also for cleanliness!" were constantly heard. The reporter went there and saw that the 23 members of the Genglou team had set up a formation, with Dong Xing-si and Dong Xing-zhen competing tirelessly round after round. From morning to night, each of them had cut more than four mu, and when others advised them to rest, they wanted to fight through the night. Over there, four female workers in the worker team were closely chasing a male worker, not letting him get ahead. Salespersons delivering goods and health workers on mobile medical teams also launched a competition. All 195 salespersons in the county were divided into 59 delivery teams, bringing rain gear to the fields and sickles to the land. Salesperson Lü Yuzeng found that Zhang Lianyuan Village was short of sickles, so he immediately asked the leadership for instructions and organized four workers to rush to make 400 sickles in one day and night. Five hundred medical personnel, carrying medicine kits, participated in wheat cutting, providing treatment during breaks. The young pioneer teams and the elderly and young children's wheat-picking teams were also swept into the heatwave of the competition.

    Watching the wheat in the lake fall piece by piece, and small golden mountains piling up in an instant, a threshing competition unfolded. People are waiting with excitement for the good news of large-scale high yields!

    今日梁山

    山东梁山县全党全民抢收小麦的战斗急如风火，每天以收运十万亩的速度向前挺进。
    这地方是昔日梁山英雄聚义所在。去年小麦获得丰收，今年七十多万亩小麦，比去年又不知好了几倍！只见秸高齐胸，穗头像刀切一样齐整。那二十万亩高额丰产麦，一般人进去几乎露不出头来。站在梁山顶纵目远望，但见方圆一百多里昔日的大小水泊，现在却变成了金光闪闪的麦海；无数抢收大军，像在金浪滔天的海洋里翻滚。他们挥动镰刀、杈笆，不分昼夜，突击抢收。
    梁山县分为湖里湖外两类地区。七十万亩小麦，湖里占四十万亩以上。湖里人少地多，公社化以前，种的麦子又少又不好，还常常遭受水害。今年小麦种得又多又好。但是收麦期间正值汛期到来，保证颗粒归仓就是这个地区人民很艰巨的任务。省、地、县、社四级党委都特别重视湖里大片麦田的收割。县委在商老庄安下了前线指挥部，郭真书记亲自挂帅。另外还调来大批县社领导干部，分头到各生产队分片分块，分工包干，领导收割。宣传大军也都动员起来，为麦收服务。6月7日，战斗的序幕刚刚揭开，地委又派农村工作部杨部长前来帮助工作。这天省妇联张恺主席，县委第一书记高文德也赶来了。
    在南北七十里，东西四十里的湖洼地带，人群遍野，红旗招展。打麦场上隆隆的脱粒机旋转不停，汽车、马车、人力车日夜在公路上赶运麦子。机关干部，工人，学生，渔民，演员，田间送货队，巡回医疗组，汽车运输队，外社支援队和本地社员，共十路人马，兵对兵，将对将的布好了竞赛的阵势。大陆口管理区的修堤专业队，从黄河上调回来第二天就参加了战斗。这支健儿，去秋种麦时曾在湖洼里干过半月，评为红旗队；这次又在那片麦田上安营扎寨。老模范王建德是个有名的割麦能手，年已五十岁了。你看他左手抓麦，右手挥镰，刷刷刷一气跑到众人头里。“老黄忠”吕兴施把腰一扎，紧追紧赶。小伙子们更不服气，顿时掀起了组与组，人与人之间的竞赛。在商老庄的西南方，不时传来了“追呀，比快还要比净！”的呐喊声。记者走到那里，看见耿楼小队二十三人摆开了一个阵势，董兴四、董兴振一趟又一趟赛个不休；从早到晚，每人都割了四亩多，别人劝他们休息，他们还要夜战。那边工人队伍里四个女工正紧紧追赶一位男工，寸步不让。售货员送货和卫生员巡回医疗也开展了竞赛。全县售货员一百九十五名，分作五十九个送货组，把防雨工具送到场间，把镰刀送到地里。售货员吕玉增发现张敛远村缺镰，他立即请示领导，组织了四个工人一昼夜赶制了四百张。五百个医务人员，携带药包参加割麦，趁空隙治疗。少年队、老年幼儿拾麦队，也都卷入火热的竞赛浪潮。
    眼看满湖里的麦子一片片倒下去，刹时又堆起了一座座小金山。展开了脱粒竞赛。人们都怀着兴奋的心情，等待着大面积高产的喜讯！
