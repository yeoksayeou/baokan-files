Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Tegucigalpa Dispatch: The people of the Honduran capital yesterday "greeted" an "investigative committee" from the "Organization of American States," which had come from Washington, with demonstrations and a shower of eggs and potatoes. This committee, at the instigation of the United States, is attempting to interfere in the national liberation movements and the people's anti-dictatorial struggles in the Caribbean region under the pretext of "investigating" the situation in Nicaragua.

The report said that Honduran citizens participating in the demonstration marched with banners reading "Organization of American States, Get Out!" and "Shameful Interference!" to the hotel where the "investigative committee" was staying, throwing eggs and potatoes at the "investigative committee's" residence. The procession then marched to the Presidential Palace to demonstrate, shouting slogans against U.S. imperialism.

According to another report, the Cuban government yesterday wrote to the Council of the Organization of American States, strongly protesting the organization's interference in the internal affairs of the Nicaraguan people under the guise of "investigation." In this letter, the Cuban government notified that if the organization intends to conduct a so-called "investigation" within Cuban territory, Cuba will refuse to receive the organization's "investigative committee."

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, TASS Mexico City, June 16th: The Mexican newspaper "Excelsior" recently published an article condemning the United States' efforts to use the "Organization of American States" as a tool for maintaining dictatorial rule in Latin America.

The author of the article wrote that the situation in the region is becoming increasingly acute, and the demand to abolish dictatorships has caused deep anxiety in the United States.

The author emphasized that the dictatorial systems in many countries have been maintained thanks to direct military assistance from the United States to Latin American dictators. American planes and guns are used by dictators to slaughter the people and suppress all forms of protest. Now the United States is using the "Organization of American States" to establish an international police force, using this organization as a tool to maintain the moribund dictatorial systems in Latin America.

The author of the article said that the establishment of an "international police force" within the "Organization of American States" makes it possible for the United States to use it to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries and suppress people's movements.

Xinhua News Agency, June 16th, Washington Dispatch: The "Organization of American States" investigative committee departed from Washington on the evening of the 14th to conduct an "investigation" of the anti-dictatorial armed struggle in Nicaragua in Honduras, Costa Rica, and other Central American countries. The report said that the investigative committee is scheduled to arrive in Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, today.

The decision to establish the above-mentioned "Organization of American States" investigative committee was passed at the "Organization of American States" meeting held in Washington in early June at the instigation of the United States. The purpose of the United States in supporting the convening of this meeting was to attempt to interfere in the increasingly high tide of national liberation movements and anti-dictatorial armed struggles in the Caribbean region under the pretext of investigating the situation in Nicaragua. According to reports, this blatant interference by the "Organization of American States" in the internal affairs of Latin American countries has been unanimously condemned by public opinion in some Latin American countries.

The parliaments of Venezuela, El Salvador, and Costa Rica have recently passed resolutions successively, criticizing the "Organization of American States" for interfering in the internal affairs of Nicaragua and expressing support for the Nicaraguan people's anti-dictatorial struggle. In New York, Nicaraguan exiles recently held a demonstration in front of the United Nations building to protest the "Organization of American States'" interference in the internal affairs of their country. The "Committee for the Liberation of Nicaragua," organized by Central American expatriates in the Argentine capital, also recently sent a telegram to the "Organization of American States," expressing its firm opposition to the organization's interference in the internal affairs of Nicaragua.

    不许美国利用“美洲国家组织”干涉民族解放运动
    洪都拉斯人民怒逐“调查委员会”
    墨西哥报纸斥责美国支持拉丁美洲独裁者屠杀人民
    新华社17日讯　特古西加尔巴消息：洪都拉斯首都人民昨日以游行示威和投掷阵雨似的鸡蛋和土豆“接待”了从华盛顿来到这里的“美洲国家组织”的一个所谓“调查委员会”。这个委员会是在美国指使下企图以“调查”尼加拉瓜局势为口实，来干预加勒比海地区的民族解放运动和人民的反独裁斗争。
    消息说，举行示威游行的洪都拉斯市民带着“美洲国家组织滚回去！”“可耻的干涉！”等标语走到“调查委员会”所住的旅馆，向“调查委员会”的住所投掷了鸡蛋和土豆。接着游行队伍走到总统府前举行示威，高喊反对美帝国主义的口号。
    另据报道，古巴政府昨天写信给美洲国家组织理事会，对这个组织以“调查”为名干预尼加拉瓜人民的内政提出强烈抗议。古巴政府在这封信中通知说，如果这个组织打算在古巴领土范围内进行所谓“调查”，古巴将拒绝接待这个组织的“调查委员会”。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城16日讯：墨西哥“新闻报”最近发表文章，谴责美国力图把“美洲国家组织”作为维护拉丁美洲独裁统治的工具。
    文章作者写道，这个地区的局势日益尖锐化，要求废除独裁的事件引起了美国的深刻不安。
    作者强调指出，由于美国对拉丁美洲独裁者的直接军事援助，使许多国家的独裁制度得以保持。美国的飞机和枪炮被独裁者用来屠杀人民和镇压一切形式的抗议。现在美国又利用“美洲国家组织”建立国际警察，把这个组织作为保持拉丁美洲苟延残喘的独裁制度的工具。
    文章作者说，在“美洲国家组织”范围内建立“国际警察”，使美国有可能利用它来干涉拉丁美洲各国的内政和镇压人民运动。
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：“美洲国家组织”的调查委员会14日晚已经从华盛顿出发到中美洲的洪都拉斯、哥斯达黎加等国对尼加拉瓜的反独裁武装斗争进行“调查”。消息说，调查委员会预定在今天到达尼加拉瓜的首都马那瓜。
    成立上述“美洲国家组织”调查委员会的决定是美国指使下6月初在华盛顿举行的“美洲国家组织”会议上通过的。美国支持召开这次会议的目的，是以调查尼加拉瓜局势为名；企图干预加勒比海地区日益高涨的民族解放运动和反独裁的武装斗争。据报道，“美洲国家组织”这种蛮横干涉拉丁美洲各国内政的行为，受到了拉丁美洲一些国家舆论的一致谴责。
    委内瑞拉、萨尔瓦多和哥斯达黎加的国会最近先后通过决议，对“美洲国家组织”干涉尼加拉瓜内政的行为提出指责，并且表示支持尼加拉瓜人民反独裁的斗争。在纽约，尼加拉瓜流亡者最近曾在联合国大厦前面举行示威，抗议“美洲国家组织”对他们的国家的内政所进行的干涉。中美各国侨民在阿根廷首都组织的“解放尼加拉瓜委员会”最近也致电“美洲国家组织”，表示坚决反对这个组织对尼加拉瓜内政的干涉。（附图片）
