This is Xingzi…
Xu Xinjie

Today at dusk, I received your letter—from an old friend I haven't seen for ten years. You want me to describe the changes in your hometown, Xingzi County, Jiangxi. Speaking of this, friend, memories surge through my heart like the waves of the Yangtze River.

I remember one autumn night before liberation, with falling leaves, we lay on the grass of the schoolyard. With infinite grief and indignation, you spoke to me about your hometown: Xingzi County, a place stained with blood, infested with jackals and tigers. Bureaucrats and landlords were tyrannical and domineering; farmers toiled year-round in wind and rain, yet still starved!

But now, Xingzi County has changed, changed, become so beautiful, so transformed that you simply cannot imagine!

You, after arriving in Jiujiang via Wuhan, no longer need to worry about walking the ninety-li bridge, over water obstacles and rugged mountain roads. In Jiujiang, just buy a ticket from Jiujiang to Xingzi, and you can speed along that wide, flat highway. Along the way, you can see so many newly built houses, so many steel and concrete bridges; cars shuttle back and forth like weaving shuttles. When your car crosses the Jiuxing Bridge and enters the Gaolong area, you will hear the rumbling of machines on the mountain. You will see red houses in the green woods; that is the newly built hydroelectric power station in the commune. When the car arrives at Haihui, the place that was once bombed into rubble by the Japanese invaders, today, rows of tall buildings have risen again. The red-brick, green-tiled houses on the hilltop are the newly built workers' sanatorium. Formerly the villas of bureaucrats and wealthy old men, now they are places for the working people to rest. Passing Haihui, you reach the majestic Taibai Ridge. The pottery clay here has made Jingdezhen famous throughout the world. Listen, the mountainside is full of voices, the sound of hoes and shovels rings out; that is our state-owned mining field… Ah, what is that? A huge stone archway stands tall; that is the long-missed Bailu Academy, where the Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianist Zhu Xi lectured. If you are interested in taking a look into the mountains, you will find that the academy has been renovated, the White Deer Grotto is intact, and the Fox Immortal’s tomb still exists. However, with your heart set on home, you should hurry onward. Passing Wulipai and leaving Jiangjiatu behind, you will see that the wilderness where foxes and rabbits roamed in the past is now full of new houses, singing with the sounds of motors and hammers. This is our agricultural machinery factory. The car enters the ancient and magnificent North City, ah, you've arrived, you've arrived. Now, take a careful look, look at your hometown that you have been away from for ten years!

As soon as you get off the car, what will first catch your eye, without a doubt, must be the countless chimneys piercing the clouds, and the dazzling red tiles and green walls. What is this, what is this? It is our refractory material factory. The workers here produce thousands upon thousands of golden bricks every day, supporting the steel marshal's fame far and wide! Walking forward, do you still remember? That is the parade ground of Zhou Yu, the famous general of the Three Kingdoms. The parade ground has now become our broadcasting station. Further ahead, the former broken walls have been transformed into newly built department stores, cultural clubs, and government offices, factories, schools, and shops. If you go to the edge of Poyang Lake to take a look, the lake is dotted with fishing sails, masts like clouds. The members of the commune sing songs as they cast their nets. On the jade-green lake, in the blink of an eye, ten thousand dan of grain are hauled in!

Perhaps, what you are most concerned about is the densely populated villages on the plains, the hometown of the pastoral poet Tao Yuanming? Let me tell you, the poet's former residence, Li Li, has now been built to be ten thousand times more beautiful than Peach Blossom Spring; in the People's Commune, people connect hearts, fields connect together, and production leaps forward with soaring momentum! Look, under the green mountains, the south wind stirs up layers of rice waves. Xingzi, this famous grain-deficient county for thousands of years, has now become a high-yield rice county! If you can go to Lushan Longli, which is famous for its high mountains, cold water, strong winds, cold land, and poverty, you will find that every household is well-fed and clothed, and villages are adding tiles and bricks, a new atmosphere.

Friend, this is Xingzi, your hometown. The changes in Xingzi cannot be fully described, the new events in Xingzi cannot be counted. Even if I had a thousand pens and ten thousand mouths, I am afraid I would still leave much unsaid. You should come back and see for yourself!

    这就是星子……
    徐新杰
    今天黄昏，我接到了你——阔别了十年之久的老友的来信。你要我为你描述你的家乡——江西星子县的变化，提起这，朋友，往事又像长江波浪似的冲向了我的心房。
    记得解放前一个秋风落叶的月夜，我们躺在学校的青草地上，你怀着无限悲忿的心情，向我谈到你的家乡：星子县，那是血迹斑斑、豺狼虎豹盘踞的地方。官僚、地主，强横霸道；作田人一年四季风吹雨打，还得饿断肠！
    可是，现在的星子县变了，变了，变得如此美好，变得你简直不可能想像！
    你，经武汉到九江之后，再也不用耽心要步行九十里桥败水阻、坎坷不平的山路了。在九江，只要买上一张九江到星子的车票，你便能在那宽大平坦的公路上急驰而过。一路上，你可以看到多少新建的房屋，多少座钢骨水泥的桥梁；汽车穿梭似的来来往往。当你的车子越过九星桥，进入高垅境时，你会听见山上机器隆隆响，你会看到，绿树林里有红房，那是公社里新建的水力发电站。汽车驶到了海会，那曾被日寇炸成一片瓦砾场的地方，今天，竟然又矗起了一排排的高楼大厦。山顶上那红砖绿瓦的房子，是新修的工人疗养院。从前是官僚阔老的别墅，如今是劳动人民休息的地方。过海会，就到了巍峨的太白岭。这里的陶土，使得景德镇名闻天下。听吧，山腰里人声一片，锄头锹镐响叮当，那就是我们的国营采矿场……啊，那是哪里？耸立着一座巨石碑坊，那是久违了的白鹿书院，宋代理学家朱熹讲学的地方。如果你有兴致进山一看，你就会发觉，书院已经修葺一新，白鹿洞完好无缺，狐仙墓故冢犹存。不过，归心似箭的你，还是快些往前走吧。经过五里牌，甩过姜家凸，你又会看到往年狐兔满山的荒野已经是新房一片，欢唱着的是马达声，铁锤声。这是我们的农业机械厂。汽车驶入了古老雄伟的北城，啊，到了，到了，现在，仔细地看看吧，看看你离别了十年的故乡！
    一下车，首先映入你的眼帘的，不用说，一定是那无数支耸入云际的烟囱，是那一片耀眼的红瓦青墙。这是哪里，这是哪里？是我们的耐火器材厂。这里的工人日制金砖千千万，支援钢帅的美名远近传扬！往前走，你还记得吧？那是三国名将周瑜的点将台。点将台如今已经成为了我们的广播站。再往前走，昔日的断垣残壁，已经变成新建的百货大楼、文化俱乐部和机关、工厂、学校、商店。如果你再到鄱阳湖边去看看，湖面上渔帆点点，樯桅如云。公社的社员们唱着歌儿把网撒，碧玉湖上，眨眼间扯起万担粮！
    也许，你最关心的还是那平原上繁星般密布的村户，是那田园诗人陶渊明的故里？告诉你吧，诗人的故居——栗里，如今已建设得比桃源还要美上万倍；在人民公社里，人连心，田连片，生产跃进气势昂！看吧，青山下，南风吹起层层稻浪。星子，这个几千年来著名的缺粮县，如今已经变成水稻丰产县了！如果你能够再到那个以山高、水冷、风劲、地寒和贫穷著名的庐山垅里去看看，你便会发觉家家丰衣足食，村村买瓦添砖的新气象。
    朋友，这就是星子，你的家乡。星子的变化道不尽，星子的新事数不完，纵使我有一千支笔，一万张嘴，恐怕也还是挂一漏万。你还是回来亲自看一看吧！
