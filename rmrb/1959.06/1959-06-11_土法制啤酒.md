    Indigenous Beer Brewing
    Ordinary breweries require equipment such as boilers and electric motors, but the Changsha Brewery uses indigenous equipment made of materials such as ceramics, bricks, wood, and bamboo for production. The total equipment investment of this factory is only 10,000 to 15,000 yuan, which is only 1% of the equipment investment of a brewery of the same scale using foreign methods, but the beer produced can rival beer produced by foreign methods.
    The Ministry of Light Industry recently held a symposium on indigenous beer production in Changsha to promote the experience of this factory.

    土法制啤酒
    一般的啤酒厂都要有锅炉、电动机等设备，而长沙啤酒厂却用陶瓷、砖、木、竹等材料做的土设备进行生产。这个厂的全部设备投资只有一万到一万五千元，仅及同样规模用洋法生产的啤酒厂设备投资的1％，而生产出来的啤酒，可以同洋法生产的啤酒比美。
    轻工业部最近在长沙召开了啤酒土法生产座谈会，推广这个厂的经验。
