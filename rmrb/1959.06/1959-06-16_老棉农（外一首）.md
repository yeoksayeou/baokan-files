    Old Cotton Farmer
    (and another poem)
    Ge Zhenying
    Look, he squats silently in the cotton field,
    You must not disturb him;
    Every day, day after day, he's like this,
    Wanting to talk to his beloved cotton seedlings several times.
    He grows together with the cotton seedlings in the soil,
    Squeezing out his own sweat to nourish the cotton seedlings.
    He understands when cotton seedlings like warmth,
    When they like coolness, when they need to drink water,
    And when they need to bask in the sun.
    If you see a smile on his face,
    Great! That is a sign of a bumper cotton harvest.
    For several years, unfading flowers have been blooming on his face,
    For several years, the cotton plants have also been full of silver peaches that cannot be picked.
    Yes, the smile on his face is more every year,
    And the cotton in the commune is also more bountiful every year,
    This man grows together with the cotton in the soil,
    He is the famous old cotton farmer, Li Jingqing.
        New Mountain Song
    Lingling girl is as fierce as a tiger,
    She reaps twenty mu of wheat in one breath.
    She is the best in the wheat transport team,
    Pushing a cart loaded with a small golden mountain.
    Pushing the cart across the Clear Water River,
    The Clear Water River laughs "giggle".
    Lifting the river water to wash her feet,
    The river water invites her to sing a song.
    The girl loves to sing the Great Leap Forward song,
    She sings many Great Leap Forward songs,
    Singing across this river and that river,
    Singing across this slope and that slope.

    老棉农
    （外一首）
    戈振缨
    看，他默默的蹲在棉田里，
    你千万别去惊动他；
    他每天每天都是这样儿，
    要和心爱的棉苗谈几次话。
    他和棉苗一起在泥土里生长，
    挤出自己的汗液把棉苗喂养。
    他懂得棉苗啥时喜暖，
    啥时喜凉，啥时需要喝水，
    啥时又要晒太阳。
    如果你看他脸上现出微笑，
    好啊！那就是棉花丰收的预兆。
    几年来，他脸上一直盛开着不雕谢的花朵，
    几年来，棉棵儿也一直满结着摘不尽的银桃。
    是的，他脸上的微笑一年比一年更多，
    社里的棉花也一年比一年丰收，
    这个人和棉花一起在泥土里生长，
    他就是有名的棉农李镜清老头。
        新山歌
    玲玲姑娘赛老虎，
    一气割麦二十亩。
    运麦队里她拔尖，
    一车推座小金山。
    推车涉过清水河，
    清河流水笑“咯咯”。
    撩起河水洗洗脚，
    河水请她唱首歌。
    姑娘喜唱跃进歌，
    跃进歌儿唱的多，
    唱过这河过那河，
    唱过这坡过那坡。
