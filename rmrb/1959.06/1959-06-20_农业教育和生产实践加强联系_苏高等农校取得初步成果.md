Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th - Soviet higher agricultural schools have recently adopted many measures to strengthen the connection between agricultural education and production practice, and have achieved preliminary results.

    Since the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union put forward the policy of closely linking education with production, many higher agricultural schools in the Soviet Union have moved from cities to rural areas, especially from the central regions to the eastern regions, initially changing the unreasonable distribution and concentration of higher agricultural schools in the cities. At the same time, new higher agricultural schools have also been established in the eastern regions. As a result, the proportion of the annual enrollment quota of agricultural colleges in the eastern regions in the total enrollment quota of agricultural colleges nationwide has increased, while the proportion in the central regions has relatively decreased. For example, during the summer of last year, the enrollment quota of higher agricultural schools in Siberia, the Far East, and the Kazakh Republic increased by 38.2% compared with 1953, while the enrollment quota of higher agricultural schools in the European part of the Russian Federation decreased by 32.7% compared with 1953. At the same time, the number of students entering higher agricultural schools with practical work experience has also greatly increased. If in 1956, people with production experience and demobilized soldiers only accounted for 14% of the total enrollment in higher agricultural schools nationwide, then the proportion of these two types of people admitted in the fall of last year has increased to 63.2% of the total enrollment.
    In order to strengthen the connection between education and production practice, students of Soviet higher agricultural schools go to the reclamation areas of Siberia and the Kazakh Republic every year to participate in harvesting work. Last year, nearly 10,000 agricultural college students drove tractors and combine harvesters in the fields.
    In order to facilitate students' participation in agricultural production and acquire specific production knowledge, Soviet higher agricultural schools have also expanded the farms attached to the schools specifically for students to practice and conduct scientific research. From 1956 to 1958, forty state-owned farms and thirteen experimental stations nationwide were handed over to higher agricultural schools. At present, higher agricultural schools nationwide have a total of 127 affiliated farms, eight forest farms, and 30 experimental stations. The total land area of ​​these production institutions reaches 550,000 hectares, which is double that of 1956. Currently, first and second-year students of higher agricultural schools must work on these affiliated farms during the farming season, while third-year students work as assistants to production team leaders in farms or collective farms during their internships. Fourth-year students go to farms, state farms, and machinery repair stations for longer periods of practical work and assume certain positions. This increases their production practice during their studies and improves their learning outcomes.

    农业教育和生产实践加强联系
    苏高等农校取得初步成果
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联高等农业学校最近采取了许多措施，以加强农业教育和生产实践的联系，并且取得了初步的成果。
    自从苏联共产党和政府提出了教育同生产密切联系的方针后，苏联各地许多高等农业学校纷纷从城市迁往农村，特别是从中部地区迁移到东部地区，初步改变了高等农业学校过去分布不合理和集中在城市的现象。同时，在东部地区还开办了新的高等农业学校。这样，就使东部地区的农业高等学校每年的招生名额在全国高等农业学校招生总名额中占的比例有所增长，而中央地带的比例则相对地减少了。例如，在去年暑期西伯利亚、远东地区和哈萨克共和国高等农业学校的招生名额比1953年增加了38.2％，而俄罗斯联邦欧洲部分高等农业学校的招生名额则比1953年减少了32.7％。同时，在进入高等农业学校的学生中，有实际工作经验的人数也大大增加了。如果1956年全国高等农业学校招收的有生产经验的人和复员军人只占招生总额的14％，那么，去年秋天入学的这两方面的人数在招生总额中所占的比例已增加到63.2％。
    为了加强教育和生产实践的联系，苏联高等农业学校的学生，每年都要到西伯利亚和哈萨克共和国的开垦地区参加收获工作。去年，就有将近一万名农业高等学校的学生驾驶拖拉机和联合机在田野上工作过。
    为了便于学生参加农业生产，获得具体的生产知识，苏联各高等农业学校还扩充了附属于学校的专供学生实习和进行科学研究的农场。从1956年到1958年，全国就有四十个国营农场、十三个试验站被交给高等农业学校。现在，全国高等农业学校共拥有一百二十七个附属农场，八个林场，三十个试验站。这些生产机构的土地总面积共达五十五万公顷，比1956年增加了一倍。现在，高等农业学校一、二年级学生都必须在农事季节在这些附属农场上工作，三年级学生在实习期间则去农场或集体农庄担任生产队长的助手等工作。四年级学生就要到农庄农场和机器修理站去作较长期的实际工作，并担任一定的职务。这样便增加了他们在学习期间的生产实践，提高了他们的学习效果。
