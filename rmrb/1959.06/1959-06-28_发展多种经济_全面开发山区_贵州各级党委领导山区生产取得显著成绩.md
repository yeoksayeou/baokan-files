Developing Diverse Economies and Comprehensively Developing Mountainous Areas
Guizhou's Party Committees at All Levels Lead Mountainous Production and Achieve Remarkable Results

(Our Dispatch) Guizhou Province's diversified economic production has greatly developed this year, with spring tea, afforestation, and medicinal materials exceeding their semi-annual targets.

Combining the characteristics of mountainous areas, "developing diversified economies with grain and oil as the mainstay and comprehensively developing mountainous areas" has been the guiding ideology for Party committees at all levels in Guizhou to lead agricultural production in recent years. This year, the province has adopted the form of "agricultural and commercial contracts," incorporating various production plans into the commune's overall plan and implementing them at the production team level. This has enabled diversified economic production to achieve further development on the basis of last year's great leap forward.

From the production and purchase situation of some products in the first five months of this year, many types of production have exceeded their semi-annual targets. Spring tea production increased by 15% compared to last year. The spring medicinal materials purchase volume reached 7.2 million yuan, which is 20% more than the total medicinal materials purchase volume of last year. The variety reached thirty-six kinds, while last year's total medicinal materials purchase variety was only three hundred and fifty kinds. Among native products, the purchase volume of raw lacquer, gallnuts, saltpeter, and other items increased by more than 50% compared to last year. From the current silkworm rearing, cocoon production, and purchases in some areas, it is estimated that spring silkworm production will increase by two times compared to last year. The transplanting work of flue-cured tobacco is also progressing faster than the same period last year. In animal husbandry production, the recent implementation of the principle of combining collective and individual breeding has solved the feed problem. Now, the production situation in most areas has greatly improved. The afforestation task has been completed 96% of the annual plan. Twenty-four of the province's fifty-six counties have completed their annual plan, and the quality of afforestation is higher than in previous years. According to inspections in some areas, the survival rate reached over 90%. From the current planting and management situation, other productions have expanded much more than last year.

The reason why Guizhou Province was able to achieve simultaneous and comprehensive development in developing diversified economies in the first half of this year is primarily due to the attention of Party committees at all levels, who included each item in the plan at each level, providing a relatively strict production plan as a guarantee for each production. For example, during this spring's afforestation, it was also the time when various places were carrying out fertilizer accumulation campaigns. Because all communes included afforestation in their plans, and various productions were arranged and deployed in a unified manner, many areas, in order to ensure the completion of the afforestation task, county party secretaries and other leading comrades personally led teams to the mountains for afforestation. Therefore, not only did the labor shortage not delay afforestation, but on the contrary, more people participated and the afforestation speed was faster, which became the characteristic of this spring's afforestation. Because all productions are included in the commune production plan and implemented at the production team level, each commune and production team has dedicated personnel or specialized production teams responsible for managing various productions, so that production does not suffer from neglect or prioritization. Secondly, the province this year, in the development of diversified economic production, paid special attention to the combination of comprehensive development and key development, making various productions have a more reliable foundation. On the one hand, various regions have paid attention to making full use of natural conditions to operate diversified production and increase income; on the other hand, they have also paid attention to developing several key productions based on the natural conditions, technical strength, and farmers' experience of their own county and commune. The more famous examples are the pears of Weining, the kumquats of Huishui, the Dahongpao tea of Xingyi, the Chinese fir of Jinping, the madder bamboo of Chishui, the tea of Meitan, and the oil tea of Tongren, all of which have become key development projects. Implementing the policy of walking on two legs in various productions is also an important factor in the smooth development of diversified economies. For example, in forestry production, the policy of planting both timber forests and economic forests; both large-scale fast-growing and high-yielding forests and utilizing scattered land and planting fruit trees and other economic forest trees beside houses and roads; and both grasping afforestation and grasping forestry by-product production are implemented, achieving a combination of the primary and secondary, a combination of the long-term and short-term, and using the short-term to support the long-term, so that the long-term interests of afforestation are combined with the immediate interests of the masses, enabling forestry production to develop rapidly throughout Guizhou Province.

    发展多种经济　全面开发山区
    贵州各级党委领导山区生产取得显著成绩
    本报讯　贵州省多种经济生产，今年有很大发展，春茶、造林、药材等超额完成上半年任务。
    结合山区特点，“发展以粮油为主的多种经济，全面开发山区”，是贵州各级党委几年来领导农业生产的指导思想。今年又采取了订“农商合同”的形式，把各项生产计划纳入公社全盘计划，并落实到生产队，使多种经济生产在去年跃进基础上，又取得进一步发展。
    从今年前五个月部分产品的生产和收购情况看，许多种生产都已超额完成上半年的任务。春茶的产量比去年增产15％。春季药材收购量已达七百二十万元，比去年全年药材收购量还多20％，品种达三十六种，去年全年收购药材品种只三百五十种，土特产中生漆、五棓子、火硝等的收购量都比去年增加50％以上。春蚕生产从今春育蚕与目前结茧及部分地区收购情况看，预计可比去年增产两倍。烤烟的移栽工作，也比去年同期进度快。畜牧业生产，在最近贯彻了集体饲养与个人饲养相结合的方针，解决了饲料问题，现在大部分地区生产情况有很大的起色。造林任务已完成全年计划的96％，全省五十六个县里有二十四个县完成了全年计划，造林质量比往年都高，据对部分地区检查，成活率达到90％以上。其他各项生产，从目前种植和经营情况看，都比去年扩大很多。
    贵州省今年上半年，在发展多种经济方面，能够作到齐头并进全面发展的原因，首先是由于各级党委的重视，并逐级分项列入计划，使各项生产有了较严格的生产计划作保证。如今春造林时，正是各地展开积肥运动的时候，由于各公社都把造林列入了计划，各项生产有了统一安排和布置，许多地区为保证完成造林任务，县委书记等领导同志都亲自率队上山造林，因此，各地不仅没有因劳动力紧张而耽误造林，相反地参加的人多、造林速度快，成为今春造林的特点。由于各项生产都列入公社生产计划，并落实到生产队，各公社、各生产队都设有专人或专业生产队负责管理各项生产，使生产不致发生顾此失彼、因重失轻的情况。其次，全省今年在发展多种经济生产中，特别注意了全面发展与重点发展相结合，使各项生产具有更加可靠的基础。各地区一方面注意了充分利用自然条件经营多种生产，增加收入；另方面也注意了根据本县、本公社的自然条件，技术力量，农民经验等有重点的发展几项生产。比较有名的威宁的梨、惠水的金钱桔、兴义的大红袍、锦屏的杉木、赤水的茜竹、湄潭的茶叶、铜仁的油茶等都成为重点发展项目。在各项生产中，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，也是多种经济得以顺利发展的重要因素。如林业生产中，贯彻了既造用材林也造经济林；既搞大面积速生丰产林，也利用零星土地及宅旁路边种植果树等经济林木；既抓造林，也抓林副业生产；作到主、副结合，长短结合，以短养长，使造林的长远利益与群众眼前利益相结合，使林业生产在贵州全省迅速地发展起来。
