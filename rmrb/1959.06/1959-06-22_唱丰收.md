Singing of the Harvest

    The sun comes out and shines on the mountain,
    From afar, the wheat fields are a sea of yellow,
    The wind blows the wheat ears, nodding and smiling,
    A flash of golden light, wave upon wave.
    Last night, the commune held a meeting,
    Seize the time to harvest the wheat busily,
    As the east turns white and the sky brightens,
    The commune members rise and leave their villages.
    Walking along, they sing,
    Singing of the good times of the harvest,
    Production gets better year by year,
    The commune road is strong and true.
    The commune has many people and great strength,
    In an instant, it is cut and carried to the threshing ground,
    Some turn it over, some thresh it,
    Golden new wheat piles fill the granary.
      (Anhui Folk Song)

    唱丰收
    太阳出来照山岗，
    远看麦地一片黄，
    风吹麦穗点头笑，
    一闪一浪放金光。
    昨晚社里开了会，
    抓紧时间收麦忙，
    东方发白天刚亮，
    社员起身出了庄。
    一边走来一边唱，
    歌唱丰收好时光，
    生产一年好一年，
    公社道路就是强。
    公社人多力量大，
    霎时割好挑上场，
    有的翻来有的打，
    金黄新麦堆满仓。
      （安徽民歌）
