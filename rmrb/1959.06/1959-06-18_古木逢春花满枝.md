Withered Tree Meets Spring, Branches Full of Blossoms
By Our Correspondent Sun Shikai

In the enchanting Beihai Park stands the Research Institute of Culture and History, featuring rockeries, lotus ponds, and tranquil studios. Over ninety scholars are employed here, all elderly men and women in their sixties and seventies, possessing a wealth of experience. They were greatly inspired by Premier Zhou's speech at the tea party for the elderly held after the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and held many discussions. The old people are willing to record the changes they have experienced throughout their lives, as well as the knowledge and experience they have accumulated, and pass them on to future generations in this happy later life. They also expressed their willingness to respond to the call of the Party and the government, focusing on compiling and organizing materials from the late Qing Dynasty to the period before the national liberation concerning military affairs, politics, diplomacy, and society.

These elderly people are living a comfortable life in their later years. Some often compose poetry and paint, some tirelessly compile unpublished works, and some study classical poetry and history. Although they are over sixty years old, they are still very concerned about the country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and often hold forums to freely express their opinions and chat happily. At a recent current affairs forum, the nearly eighty-year-old scholar Shi Rongzhang took a break to talk to the reporter about the government's emphasis on the research work of elderly scholars. He said that the "Hubei Wenzheng," which he had just finished, has more than 630 volumes, collecting all the works of writers and scholars in Hubei Province throughout the ages. Before liberation, this old man spent more than ten years collecting materials, but he did not complete this book. After liberation, he was employed as a librarian at the Research Institute of Culture and History, and received care from the government in many ways, allowing him to concentrate on writing. Recently, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu learned that he had completed the book and specifically asked him about the compilation work, which greatly encouraged the old man. The old scholar said that although his body is a bit old, he also plans to write a history book about the Yunnan peasant uprising during the same period as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

Most of these elderly people rest at home while writing. Some are resting for a long time due to physical aging, and the Research Institute of Culture and History often sends people to visit them. Mr. Sun Renhe, who taught at some universities in Beijing for more than 30 years, has been working at home for a long time because he is old and sick and cannot come to the Research Institute of Culture and History. He lives in a spacious house, full of blooming oleanders and viburnum flowers. He recently proofread the famous Tang Dynasty book "Yiwen Leiju" of 100 volumes for Zhonghua Book Company, and found a Song Dynasty version, which he re-proofread. In addition, he plans to continue to organize some classical literature works. "Yiwen Leiju" is an encyclopedia of ancient literary works compiled more than a thousand years ago. Many important ancient works that have long been lost in China can be found excerpts in this book.

Mr. Sun Renhe also serves as a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He has translated selected famous philosophical works from the Pre-Qin and Han Dynasties into modern Chinese and corrected errors so that the general public can read and study them. In order to take care of the old man's health, the relevant departments also sent someone to be his assistant to help collect and organize materials. He only works three or four hours in the morning, and the rest of the time is for rest. On weekends, his children in Beijing come to his side to enjoy family happiness. This old scholar, who is over sixty years old, said excitedly when talking about his life in his later years: "The government takes such good care of us old people, I will try my best to do more work for the country."

Among the female librarians in this Research Institute of Culture and History are Kang Tongbi, the daughter of Kang Youwei, Liang Lingxian, the daughter of Liang Qichao, and the old painter Sun Songzhao. They are all old people in their seventies and eighties, who are good at poetry and painting.

Old Mrs. Kang Tongbi followed her father around the world since she was in her teens. Now, although her temples are gray, she refuses to admit she's old. Every morning, she always cultivates the flowers and plants in the courtyard, and sometimes practices Tai Chi. In the morning, she generally insists on working at home. When others ask about her longevity, she always smiles and says, "In the new society, I am getting younger and younger." Although the old woman is very old, she still loves activities and is enthusiastic about political life. Before the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, she went to Hangzhou as a member of the CPPCC to inspect and visit people's communes, and also inspected the production of medicinal materials. After returning to Beijing, following the "Continuation of the Chronological Biography of Mr. Kang of the South Sea" of more than 120,000 words that she compiled last year, she actively began to sort out hundreds of unpublished works written by her father Kang Youwei before and after the Wuxu coup, and strive to complete this work before this year's National Day. The seventy-nine-year-old woman's enthusiasm for work is even greater when she thinks of Premier Zhou's speech at the tea party for the elderly more than a month ago. Recently, she also wrote a poem:

Respect for the Elderly and Veneration of the Worthy, a Grand Meeting Opens,
The Spring Breeze Gently Embraces Talents,
The Literature Should Be Passed on to a New World,
Leaving Material for the People to Make History;
Ancient Times, Tang and Yu Were Known for Great Governance,
Today's Communism is Even More Prosperous,
The Duke of Zhou Governed the Country by Honoring the Elderly First,
The People's Morality Will Return and Naturally Be in the Right Direction.

    古木逢春花满枝
    本报记者　孙世恺
    在景色宜人的北海公园里有一座文史研究馆，院内有假山、荷花池和宁静的工作室。这里聘请的九十多位馆员都是六、七十岁以上的老人，有着丰富的阅历。他们听到周总理在中国人民政协第三届全国委员会第一次会议后举行的老人茶话会上的讲话，十分兴奋，还进行过多次座谈。老人们都愿意在这幸福的晚年，把自己毕生经历的变化、积累下的知识和经验，写出来传给后代。他们并表示响应党和政府的号召，着重编写、整理从清末到全国解放前这一时期的军事、政治、外交和社会的资料。
    这些老年人，都过着安逸的晚年生活，有的人常吟诗绘画，有的人孜孜不倦地整理未发表过的著述，也有些人研究古典诗文和历史。他们尽管年过花甲，仍然十分关心国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设工作，经常举行座谈会，畅叙己见，谈笑风生。在最近一次时事座谈会上，年近八十岁的老学者石荣瞕趁着休息的时候，向记者谈起政府重视老年学者的研究工作。他说，不久前刚写完的“湖北文征”有六百三十多卷，搜集了湖北省历代文人学者所有的著作。这位老人在解放前花了十多年的心血搜集资料，也没写成这部书。解放后，他被聘请为文史研究馆馆员，得到政府多方面的关怀，专心从事著述。最近董必武副主席知道他写成这部书，还特意向他询问了编撰工作的情况，给老人极大的鼓舞。这位老学者表示，他身体虽然有些衰老了，也计划再写一部和太平天国同时代的云南农民起义的史书。
    这些老年人，绝大部分都在家中一边休养一边从事写作。有的因身体衰老长期休养，文史研究馆常派人去看望他们。曾在北京一些大学任教三十多年的孙人和老先生，因年老多病不能到文史研究馆来，便长期在家里工作。他住着一所宽敞的住宅，满院都是盛开的夹竹桃和太平花。他最近为中华书局刚校正完唐代的名著“艺文类聚”一百卷，又发现了宋本，作了重校。另外，还计划继续整理一些古典文学作品。“艺文类聚”是一千多年前留下的一部编撰古代文学作品的类书，我国许多早已失传的古代重要作品，都可在这部书中找到摘录。
    孙人和老先生，还兼任中国科学院哲学研究所的研究员。他曾把先秦两汉哲学名著选译成现代汉语，并校正讹误，以便广大群众阅读研究。为了照顾老人的身体，有关部门还派人给他作助手，帮助搜集整理资料。他每天只在上午工作三、四小时，其余时间都是休息。一到周末，在北京的儿女们就来到他的身边，饱享天伦之乐。这位年过六十岁的老学者，谈起他晚年的生活时，兴奋地说：“政府对我们老人照顾太周到了，我一定尽力多给国家做些工作。”
    在这座文史研究馆的女馆员中，还有康有为的女儿康同璧，梁启超的女儿梁令娴，以及老画家孙诵昭等。她们都是七、八十岁的老人，善诗词能绘画。
    康同璧老人，从十多岁就跟随她父亲奔走国内外。现在，虽然鬓发花白，却不服老。每天清早起来，她总要培植一番院内的花草，有时还练练太极拳。上午，一般都在家中坚持工作。当别人问起她的高寿时，她总是笑着说：“在新社会里，我越活越年轻了。”老人尽管年岁很大，依然爱活动，热心政治生活。在全国政协第三届全国委员会第一次会议前，她以政协委员的身份到杭州去视察，访问人民公社，又察看药材生产情况。她回到北京，继去年编写出的十二万多字的“南海康先生年谱续编”之后，又积极着手整理她父亲康有为在戊戌政变前后写出而未表过的几百篇遗著，并争取在今年国庆节以前完成这项工作。这位七十九高龄的老人，每当想起一个多月前周总理在老人茶话会上的讲话，工作热情就更大了。最近，她还挥笔赋诗一首：
    敬老尊贤盛会开，
    春风习习揽群才，
    要将文献传新世，
    留与斯民作史材；
    古以唐虞称郅治，
    今行共产更康庄，
    周公治国先尊老，
    民德从归自有方。（附图片）
