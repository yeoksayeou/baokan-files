These past few days, in the flood control headquarters on the front lines, on the large and small dikes battered by torrential rain, and on the busy land and water transportation lines, the scene everywhere is one of "wartime." Millions of flood-fighting troops in Guangdong Province are working day and night to fight the flood with all their might and ingenuity. In order to run ahead of the flood, in order to win this battle that determines the safety of Guangzhou and the rich and beautiful Pearl River Delta, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and the secretaries of Party committees at all levels are standing at the forefront of the battle. Together with the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, cadres, workers, and farmers, they are tirelessly inspecting dikes, checking for hidden dangers, repairing dangerous sections, transporting materials, and rushing to harvest early rice, determined to make all battle preparations before the arrival of the extraordinary flood on the 24th.

The Outpost of the Flood Fight

On the night of the 23rd, a fierce battle was underway at the southwestern town – the outpost of the Beijiang Dam guarding Guangzhou.

It had been raining all day, and the river water was rising inch by inch. In the management committee of the Southwest Grand Sluice, which is one hundred meters long, the duty officers are carefully controlling the amount of water released by the sluice. More than ten meters below the sluice, the river water is surging through. At a flow rate of one hundred tons per second, it passes through the water network of the Pearl River Delta, discharging the continuously rising river water of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers, reducing the pressure on the water level, and ensuring the safety of the dam.

Along the long dike, there are heavy troops guarding almost every eight or ten feet, checking for hidden dangers and repairing dangerous sections. The members of the Hekou Commune are currently shuttling back and forth, throwing pieces of sand and soil onto the dike surface. Construction workers from Guangzhou, after a full day of hard work, are still braving the rain to build wave-dissipating walls. This wall stretches from Qingyuan and Shijiao, and is built to the southernmost end of the dam, over one hundred li long. Now, this wall is largely completed, with only some finishing work remaining in the southwest section. People are determined to build it before the arrival of the flood, turning the Beijiang Dam into an "impregnable fortress."

On the Beijiang Dam

The situation along the sixty-plus kilometers of the "Guangzhou Wall" – the Beijiang Dam – is tense but calm. The water levels of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers are rising simultaneously, and both have exceeded the warning water level along the dam. The newly built wave-dissipating stone walls on the dike stand like a Great Wall along the river. The dike is piled high with stone and sand and other large quantities of flood control and rescue materials. After these past few days of intense preparation, all the dangerous sections of the dike that needed to be repaired and reinforced have been completely repaired, and more than 47,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel have been prepared for rescue work. Although all the work on the dike is progressing well, the commanders of the flood control headquarters are still not at ease. Zhu Guang, Standing Committee Member of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, Lieutenant General Liu Xingyuan, head of the Guangzhou garrison forces, and Liu Zhaolun, commander-in-chief of the Beijiang Dam flood control, went to the dam early in the morning to inspect, check, and offer their regards.

In the Headquarters

The telephone in the water situation section of the Guangdong Province Beijiang Dam Flood Control Headquarters is ringing constantly.

"At 20:00 on the 23rd, the water levels of the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers rose simultaneously. The water level in Nanning was 70.17 meters, a rise of 1.04 meters. A flood peak appeared at Jiangkou..."

The telephone operator quickly recorded the water situation in detail and rushed to the meeting room to deliver it to Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhaolun. At this time, the commanders were listening to the report on the flood control battle for the day. A team leader was reporting: "Our No. 2 Engineering Team of the Guangzhou Municipal Engineering Bureau has high morale and is full of energy. This morning, upon receiving the task of unloading a large quantity of fir wood and sand, everyone braved the wind and rain on the river bank, unloading the materials like a race and transporting them to the work section..."

The report was already at 11:00 p.m. Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhaolun analyzed the water situation, and then decisively said: "The water level will be higher tomorrow. The highest flood peak may arrive on the 24th. The unfinished dangerous section projects must be completed quickly, the embankment road must be lengthened by ten li, and the patrol team must patrol day and night..."

Before the meeting ended, Party Secretary Ou Mengjue told those present: "We must proceed from the worst-case scenario and not relax our vigilance in the slightest... We must care about the health of the flood control fighters. Only with strong people can we defeat the flood."

On the Busy Transportation Line

A green truck loaded with bags of cement drove into the Guangzhou South Station of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway on the bank of the Pearl River. A tall man got out of the car and ran into the transportation command office of the South Station as if flying. Before he could take out his letter of introduction, he introduced himself, saying, "I am a cadre of the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters. Now the headquarters has more than 260 tons of cement and 50,000 burlap bags, which must be transported by train to the Beijiang Dam before 6:00 p.m." The people in the office immediately became nervous: ordering the vehicle room to dispatch freight cars; notifying the Shiwitang station on the opposite bank to prepare; sending people out to direct the unloading... At this time, in the freight yard opposite the command office, trucks loaded with cement were driving in one after another. The stevedores who jumped out of the trucks quickly unloaded the cement. On the other side of the freight yard, a large number of freight cars had already been dispatched. By 6:00 p.m., the flood control materials from thirteen trucks had been loaded on the train and were speeding away.

The People in the "Rear"

The people of the Pearl River Delta are also on standby, repairing dikes, rushing to harvest early rice, and preparing to meet the extraordinary flood.

The reporter took a boat to the Shaxi Production Brigade of the Dashi Commune in Fanshun County, located in the middle reaches of the Pearl River Delta and surrounded by the sea. In the fields, there were people rushing to harvest everywhere, some cutting, some threshing, some carrying, so busy that they didn't even lift their heads, only hearing the "swish, swish" of the sickles and the "pat, pat" of the threshing.

It was past 3:00 p.m., time for a break. We interviewed these female commune members who had been rushing to harvest in the fields for six days. They told us that the water in the rice fields was waist-deep a few days ago, and they insisted on scooping up bundles of rice ears from the water and harvesting them by feeling. An old woman in her fifties said: "We have spent half a year's effort here, how can we let it be washed away by the flood."

    跑在洪水前面
    新华社驻广州记者
    这几天，在防洪前线的指挥部里，在滂沱大雨的大小堤围上，在日夜繁忙的水陆运输线上，到处都是一片“战时”景象，广东省数百万防洪大军，日日夜夜在那里与洪水拚力斗智。为了跑在洪水的前面，为了决定广州和富饶美丽的珠江三角洲安危的这场战斗的胜利，省委第一书记陶铸和各级党委书记都站在阵地的最前线，他们和人民解放军官兵、干部、职工、农民们，日夜不息地巡堤围、查隐患、修险段、运物资、抢割早稻，决心在24日——特大洪水来到之前，作好一切战斗的准备。
    抗洪斗争的前哨
    23日夜间，西南镇——护卫广州的北江大堤的前哨上，正在进行着激烈的战斗。
    下了整天的雨，江水一寸寸地上涨。在一百公尺长的西南大水闸的管理委员会里，值班员正在小心地控制着水闸的放水量，在水闸的十多公尺下面，江水正汹涌地通过水闸。以每秒一百吨的流量，通过珠江三角洲的水网，把西江、北江不断上涨的河水排泄出去，减轻水位的压力，保障大堤的安全。
    在漫长的堤围上，几乎每隔八尺、十尺就有重兵把守，查隐患、抢修险段。河口公社的社员们，此刻像穿梭一样，把一块块沙土抛到堤面上去。从广州来参加抗洪的建筑工人，经过了一整天的劳累后，仍继续冒着雨，赶筑防浪墙。这道墙从清远、石角伸延下来，筑到大堤的最南端，有一百多里长。现在，这道墙已经大体上筑好了，只剩下西南段还有些结尾工程，人们决心在洪水到来之前把它筑好，叫北江大堤变成为“铜墙铁壁”。
    在北江大堤上
    全长六十多公里的“广州的围墙”——北江大堤，沿线的情况紧张而又平静。西江、北江水位同时上涨，沿堤都超过了警戒水位。堤面上新砌起的防浪石墙像长城一样屹立在江边。堤边堆满了像小山一样的石方、沙方和其它大量的防洪抢险器材。经过这几天来紧张的备战工作，需要抢修加固的危险堤段已经全部抢修完毕，已准备了抢险用的沙石四万七千多公方。堤上尽管一切工作都进行得很好，但是防洪指挥部的指挥员们还是不放心。中共广东省委常委、广东省副省长朱光、广州驻军部队首长刘兴元中将，北江大堤防洪总指挥刘兆伦等，一清早就冒雨上堤，进行巡视检查和慰问。
    在指挥部里
    广东省北江大堤防汛总指挥部水情科的电话铃不断地响着。
    “23日二十时，西江、北江水位同时上涨，南宁水位七十点一七公尺，上涨一点零四公尺，江口出现洪峰……。”
    电话员敏捷地把水情详细记录下来，匆匆跑到会议室，送到总指挥刘兆伦的手里。这时，指挥人员正在听取一天来抗洪战斗的情况。一位领队正在汇报：“我们广州市工程局第二工队二百多打桩工人士气很高，干劲很足，今早接到搬卸大批杉木和沙石的任务，大家都顶风冒雨在河岸上像赛跑似的把材料卸下来，运到工段……”
    汇报已经到深夜十一时了，总指挥刘兆伦分析了水情，然后果断地说：明天水位更高，最高的洪峰可能在24日到来，未完成的险段工程要赶快完成，护堤道要加长十里，巡逻队要日夜巡逻……。
    会议结束前，党委书记区梦觉告诉到会的人：“要从最坏情况出发，不能丝毫放松警惕……，要关心防洪战士的健康，只有人强马壮才能战胜洪水。”
    在紧张繁忙的运输线上
    一辆载满了一袋袋水泥的绿色汽车，开进了珠江岸边京广铁路广州南站。一个个儿高的人从车上下来，飞也似地跑进了南站交通运输指挥部办公室里，还来不及掏出介绍信，便自我介绍说，我是省防汛指挥部的干部，现在指挥部有两百六十多吨水泥和五万个麻包，立即要用火车在下午六时前运往北江大堤。办公室的人立即都紧张起来了：命令车辆室派车皮；通知对岸石维塘车站作好准备；派人出去指挥卸货……。这时，在指挥部办公室对面的货场上，载满水泥的汽车一辆接着一辆的开进来了。从汽车上跳下来的装卸工人迅速地卸下水泥。在货场的另一边，大量车皮早已派到。到了下午六时，十三辆汽车的防洪物资，都已载在火车上飞驶而去了。
    “后方”的人们
    珠江三角洲的人民，也在枕戈待旦地抢修堤围、抢收早稻，准备迎击特大洪水。
    记者乘船到了地处珠江三角洲中游、四面环海的番顺县大石公社沙溪生产大队，在田野上，到处是抢收的人群，有的割，有的打，有的挑，忙的连头也不抬，只听见镰刀“嚓嚓”响和“拍拍”打禾声。
    下午三点多钟，是休息的时候了，我们访问了这些在田里抢割了六天的女社员。她们告诉我们，前几天稻田里水深到腰，她们坚持着把一束束禾穗从水里捞起来，摸着收割。一个五十多岁的老大娘说：我们半年的工夫都花在这里面，那能让它给洪水冲走。
