Before and after the harvest of summer crops, many local county and commune Party committees, together with farmer representatives, commune and team cadres, and technical personnel, go to the fields to discuss measures, evaluate effort, compare yields, select good varieties, and summarize high-yield experiences. This is one of the most meaningful activities in the current summer harvest. Through such activities, people can not only deeply understand the superiority of communization and the experience of implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," but also further inspire the masses' enthusiasm, promote current production, and prepare well in terms of technical experience and seeds for a bumper summer harvest next year.

The Guo Yi Commune Party Committee in Wuxian, Jiangsu, organized the masses to conduct "field appraisals." After summarizing the experience of large-scale high-yield wheat production, veteran farmer Wang Peigu said: "The more I look, the happier I am, and the more I do, the more motivated I am! In the past, I had some opinions about close planting, but now I see that rational close planting can indeed produce more grain. The resentment in my stomach is gone, and the strength in my arms has increased!" Commune cadres also said: "After this summary, we have a clearer understanding in our hearts, and we have more knowledge to lead production." These words fully illustrate the effect of "field appraisals."

"Field appraisals" offer concrete and vivid comparisons of facts. Different varieties, different measures, and different levels of effort, under the same conditions, resulted in different yields. The "riddles" in some people's minds have now been "solved" after a winter and spring of practical activity. Which measures play a leading role in increasing production, and what things are closely related to it? The scene in the summer harvest crop fields clearly answers these questions. Some veteran farmers previously doubted the Eight-Point Charter, but now say "the Eight-Point Charter is truly effective." Some cadres in the past were not very willing to listen to different opinions, but now, through "field appraisals," they have compared high yields with low yields, and they have a clearer understanding that some individual opinions also have their own certain reasons. Thus, they realize that being good at listening to opinions from all sides allows for a comprehensive consideration of problems, making production-increasing measures more in line with local specific conditions, and avoiding the harmful practice of mechanically copying and applying the same approach to every situation.

"You don't fear not knowing the goods, you only fear not comparing the goods." After comparison, both red flags are established and shortcomings are identified. The correct approach can be promoted, and divergent opinions can be easily unified. Through appraisal, the wisdom of cadres, the masses, and technicians is merged together, and there can be a clearer understanding of the characteristics of crop varieties and the laws of crop growth under the natural conditions of the region. This is promoting democracy and promoting science, which is conducive to both boosting enthusiasm and seeking truth from facts.

    夏收作物的田间评比
    梁光景
    夏熟作物收获前后，很多地方的县、社党委同农民代表、社队干部和技术人员一起，到田间去，论措施，评干劲，比产量，选良种，总结丰产经验。这是当前夏收活动中最有意义的一件事情。通过这样的活动，不但可以使人们深刻地认识到公社化的优越性和实行农业“八字宪法”的经验，而且可以进一步鼓舞群众的干劲，推动当前的生产，并且为明年的夏季大丰收作好技术经验方面和种子方面的准备工作。
    江苏吴县郭已公社党委，组织群众进行“田头评比”，总结了小麦大面积的丰产经验以后，老农王培谷说：“越看越欢喜，越做越有劲！过去对密植有些意见，现在看到了合理密植确实能多打粮食，肚皮里的怨气出空了，臂膀上的力气增加了！”社干部也说：“经过这样总结，心里亮堂了，领导生产更有门道了。”这些话充分说明了“田头评比”的效果。
    “田头评比”，事实的对比是具体而又鲜明的。不同的品种，不同的措施，不同的干劲，在同样的条件下，获得了不同的产量。一些人心里的“谜”，经过一冬一春的实践活动，现在有了“谜底”了。哪些措施在增产中占主导地位，哪些东西是与它有紧密联系的？夏熟作物田间的图景，明显地回答了这些问题。有些老农先前对八字宪法抱怀疑态度，现在说“八字宪法真灵”。有些干部过去不大愿意听取不同的意见，现在通过“田头评比”，把产量高的和产量低的作了对比，更清楚地知道了有些个别人的意见也有它一定的道理。从而认识到善于听取各方面意见，才可以全面地考虑问题，使增产措施更切合当地具体情况，避免生搬硬套、千篇一律的有害的做法。
    “不怕不识货，只怕货比货。”比了之后，既树立了红旗，也找出了缺点，正确的做法就可以发扬，分歧的意见就容易统一。经过评比，干部、群众和技术员的智慧溶合在一起，对于作物品种的特性和在本地区的自然条件下作物生长的规律，就可以有更清楚的认识。这是发扬民主，也是发扬科学，既利于大鼓干劲，也利于实事求是。
