Wu Yuzhang said in his speech that our Party has always paid attention to summarizing experience in order to improve our work and move forward continuously. Chairman Mao often taught us to conduct investigations and research, so our Party attaches great importance to archival work.

Among them were responsible persons of relevant departments of party committees at all levels, responsible persons of archival management departments at all levels, as well as archival staff who have worked diligently and made outstanding achievements.
