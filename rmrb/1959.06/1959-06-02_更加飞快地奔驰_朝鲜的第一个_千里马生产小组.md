    Galloping Even Faster
    Korea's First "Chollima Production Team"
    The "Chollima Production Team" movement in Korea was initiated by the Chen Yingyuan team of the No. 3 electric furnace in the steelmaking workshop of the Jiangxian Steel Plant.
    On March 8th of this year, they held an enlarged meeting of the team to discuss the organization of the "Chollima Production Team." This was a rare meeting. The entire team only had eleven people, but over a thousand workers, technicians, and family members from various workshops attended as observers.
    At the meeting, they put forward the fighting goals of the initiators of the "Chollima Production Team" movement, decided to over fulfill this year's plan by 10%, and strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan more than two years ahead of schedule within this year. In addition, they planned to significantly improve product quality and strive to save raw materials, electricity, materials, and labor in order to systematically reduce costs.
    They also decided that each person should put forward two or more inventions and rationalization proposals each year and apply them to production; each person should raise their cultural level to the level of junior high or high school graduation, and strive for the qualifications of technicians and engineers within four or five years. At the same time, they should further strengthen communist education and cultivate communist moral qualities. They were determined to be shock workers who are not afraid of difficulties and to be worthy of being red fighters of the Party; and they should strengthen the unity of the working class and closely unite around the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung.
    Within a few days of launching the "Chollima Production Team" movement, the Chen Yingyuan team shortened the medium repair time of the steelmaking furnace by five or six hours compared to before, shortened the steelmaking time by about one hour, and reduced the sulfur and phosphorus content by 50% compared to the national regulations.
    The news of the Chen Yingyuan team organizing the "Chollima Production Team" spread across the country like wildfire. Within ten days of the news being released, advanced workers from various factories and enterprises, such as the Yuping Forestry Enterprise, the Longcheng Machinery Factory, the Xingnan Fertilizer Factory, the Pyongyang Textile Factory, the West Pyongyang Locomotive Depot, the Pyongyang South District Construction Engineering Company, and the Kim Chaek Ironworks, responded to the call of the Chen Yingyuan team and launched the "Chollima Production Team" movement.
    The 12th Enlarged Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions actively supported this new socialist competition movement and decided to give corresponding evaluation and commendation to production teams, workshops, and enterprises that have made special contributions in this movement. According to this decision, the Central Committee of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions awarded the Chen Yingyuan Production Team of Jiangxian Steel Plant the title of "Chollima Production Team" on March 17.
    The "Chollima Production Team" movement is still expanding, and this movement is inspiring the high labor enthusiasm of the Korean working people.

    更加飞快地奔驰
    朝鲜的第一个“千里马生产小组”
    朝鲜的“千里马生产小组”运动是降仙炼钢厂炼钢车间第三号电炉陈应源小组发起的。
    今年3月8日，他们召开小组扩大会议，讨论组织“千里马生产小组”问题。这是一个少见的会议。全小组只有十一个人，可是列席旁听的各车间工人、技术人员和工人家属却有一千多人。
    这次会上，他们提出了“千里马生产小组”运动发起者的斗争目标，决定把今年度的计划超额10％完成，争取在今年内提前两年以上完成第一个五年计划。此外，他们准备显著地提高产品的质量，竭力节约原料、电力、资材、劳动力，以便系统地降低成本。
    他们还决定，每人一年要提出两件以上的创造发明和合理化建议并运用于生产；每人要把自己的文化水平提高到初中或高中毕业的程度，在四、五年内争取技术员和工程师的资格。同时要进一步加强共产主义教育，培养共产主义道德品质。他们决心作一个不怕困难的突击手，要不愧为党的红色战士；并且要加强工人阶级的团结，紧紧地团结在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会周围。
    陈应源小组在展开“千里马生产小组”运动后的几天内，把炼钢炉的中修时间比从前缩短了五、六个小时，把炼钢时间缩短约一个小时，并把硫磺和磷的含量比国家规定量降低了50％。
    陈应源小组组织“千里马生产小组”的消息，像燎原之火一样，立即传遍全国。在消息传出后的十多天内，榆坪林产事业所、龙成机械厂、兴南肥料厂、平壤纺织厂、西平壤机务段、平壤市南区建筑工程公司、金策炼铁厂等各工厂、企业的先进工人，都纷纷响应陈应源小组的号召，掀起了“千里马生产小组”运动。
    朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会第十二次扩大全会积极支持这一个新的社会主义竞赛运动，决定对在这一运动中建立了特殊功勋的生产小组、车间、企业予以相应的评价和表扬。根据这个决定，职业总同盟中央委员会于3月17日授予降仙炼钢厂陈应源生产小组以“千里马生产小组”的称号。
    “千里马生产小组”运动还在不断扩大，这一运动正鼓舞起朝鲜劳动人民高昂的劳动热情。
