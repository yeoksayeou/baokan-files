    Experiment
    During their field production internship, the Changchun Geological Institute made a new experiment in geological exploration. This experiment was proposed by the Party committee of the institute, based on the practical experience of students in field geological production activities, to combine regional geological surveying (hereinafter referred to as "regional surveying") with prospecting. This method changed the past practice in the geological field of separating regional surveying from prospecting, greatly improving the efficiency of prospecting.
    
    The implementation of the method of combining regional surveying and prospecting was not smooth sailing and went through ideological struggles. Initially, the students followed the procedures taught in the classroom, where regional surveying was solely for regional surveying and prospecting was solely for prospecting. Students doing regional surveying would mark any potential mineral locations on the map during their mapping work and then hand it over to dedicated prospectors. In practice, this approach was ineffective. Students engaged in regional surveying were not very enthusiastic about mapping, resulting in low mapping efficiency. Dedicated prospectors relied on the maps, requiring time to familiarize themselves with them, which slowed down the overall prospecting progress. The Party committee noticed this situation and promptly conducted research, proposing the method of combining regional surveying and prospecting, and convened on-site meetings to promote it. During the meeting debates, the idea that regional surveying and prospecting should be done in two separate steps as per the old rules of the geological field was refuted. It was argued that combining regional surveying and prospecting would not only affect the quality and speed of regional surveying and mapping but also fail to find minerals. The meeting further affirmed the method proposed by the Party committee to combine regional surveying and prospecting. After the on-site meeting, when redeploying tasks, the institute's leadership simultaneously assigned both regional surveying and prospecting tasks to the students. Regional surveying was conducted while prospecting, and prospecting was conducted while regional surveying, with regional surveying guiding prospecting and prospecting driving regional surveying.
    
    After the combination of regional surveying and prospecting, the work efficiency immediately showed significant changes. Initially, a detachment of the Jinan Brigade spent two months on regional surveying without finding any minerals, completing only 520 square kilometers of regional survey mapping. However, later, in just 30 days, they completed 1,100 square kilometers of regional survey mapping. At the same time, prospecting work was carried out within this area, discovering many medium and small-sized mineral deposits.

    尝试
    长春地质学院在野外生产实习活动中，作了地质勘探工作中的新的尝试。这个尝试，就是学院党委根据学生野外地质生产活动的实践经验，总结提出区域地质测量（以下简称区测）和找矿相结合的办法。这一办法，改变了过去地质界历来的区测不管找矿，找矿不管区测的分家办法，使找矿工作效率大为提高。
    实行区测和找矿相结合的办法，并不是一帆风顺的，是经过了思想斗争的。起初，学生们是按照课堂里所讲的区测只管区测，找矿只管找矿的程序进行工作。区测的学生在填图工作中，发现了可能有矿的地方，把它标在图纸上，然后交由专门找矿的人去找。实际上这样做效果不好。搞区测工作的学生对区测填图劲头不大，填图效率不高；专门找矿的学生看图行事，需要一定时间熟悉图纸，结果形成整个找矿工作进展十分缓慢。党委注意了这情况，及时进行研究，提出区测和找矿相结合的办法，并召开现场会议推广。在会议辩论中，驳倒了那些认为区测和找矿分两步走是地质界的老规矩，区测找矿相结合，不仅影响区测填图质量和速度，而且矿也找不好等错误思想，进一步肯定了党委提出的区测、找矿相结合的办法。现场会议之后，学院领导在重新部署任务时，就把区测和找矿的两项任务同时交给学生，区测同时也找矿，找矿同时也区测，以区测指导找矿，以找矿带动区测。
    区测和找矿相结合进行后，工作效率立即出现明显的变化。吉南大队的一个分队起初区测工作进行了两个月，没有找矿，区测填图面积只完成五百二十平方公里；而后来，仅仅三十天就完成了区测填图面积一千一百平方公里。同时在这个面积范围内，还进行了找矿工作，发现了很多中、小型矿藏。            开欣  德天（附图片）
