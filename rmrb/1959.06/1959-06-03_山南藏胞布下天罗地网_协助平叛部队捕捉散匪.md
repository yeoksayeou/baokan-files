Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd. Our correspondent accompanying the army reported: The Tibetan compatriots in the Shannan area of ​​Tibet are taking the initiative to capture the scattered bandits defeated by the People's Liberation Army, or quickly report the situation of the scattered bandits to the counter-rebellion troops for search and suppression, making the scattered bandits fall into an inescapable net.

　　Near Kangrao Village in Gyantse, one day Tibetan compatriots Mingma Wangdui and Caiwang Duodeng were working in the fields during spring plowing when they encountered three scattered bandits who came to them to ask for butter and mutton to eat. The two farmers exchanged glances at that time, and Caiwang Duodeng pretended to go back to the village to fetch food and reported the news. Mingma Wangdui prevaricated and delayed the bandits in the field, and after estimating that the village was ready, he sent two bandits into the village. Soon, the bandit who stayed in the field saw more than a dozen Tibetan youths running out of the village, all holding ropes, wooden sticks, and whips. Seeing that the situation was not good, he immediately slashed at Mingma Wangdui with a knife, mounted his horse and tried to escape, but Mingma Wangdui dodged and dragged him off the horse, and they wrestled with each other. The youths who came to capture the bandit quickly arrived and tied up the bandit. The other two bandits, as soon as they entered the village, more than a hundred farmers from the whole village swarmed out from all directions, and everywhere there were shouts of "Catch the bandits! Catch the bandits!" They caught the two bandits who were frightened out of their wits. The villagers happily escorted the three bandits to the Gyantse Military Control Commission, more than a hundred miles away from the village, overnight.

　　On May 3, Tibetan compatriot Dawa Dengzhu from Luodui Village in Shannan went to graze sheep on Mount E'na, a deserted mountain more than 5,000 meters above sea level, and found thirteen bandits hiding in a dilapidated temple in a mountain depression. The bandits wanted Dawa Dengzhu to send them tsampa to eat. Dawa Dengzhu returned to the village that night and discussed with the elder Gendao Baden, and decided that the next morning the elder would ride to the PLA garrison to report, while Dawa Dengzhu would send tsampa to the bandits to prevent them from running away again because they had nothing to eat. On May 4, the elder led the troops to climb the mountain and surrounded the deserted temple, and all thirteen bandits were captured alive.

　　Zexu Village in the Zaqi area of ​​Shannan is a ferry crossing on the south bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River. Four Tibetan families live here by ferrying boats. One night, nine people dressed as lamas came to inquire about whether there were ferries and whether the People's Liberation Army was checking the ferry crossing. Seeing that their actions were suspicious, the four Tibetan families deliberately agreed to cook for the nine people, while sending people to report to the People's Liberation Army. When the People's Liberation Army arrived, the bandits were all caught before they had time to eat.

　　In the suppression of scattered bandits, many moving stories also emerged among the Tibetan compatriots. Cima Lamu, a woman from Longzi Zong, had her husband and younger brother participate in the rebellion. After the People's Liberation Army and the work team arrived in the area, she was educated and raised her awareness, so she went to look for her husband and younger brother several times, and earnestly persuaded them to quickly lay down their weapons and surrender to the People's Liberation Army to strive for leniency. However, the two bandits were obsessed with their errors and refused to listen to her advice, and continued to engage in the crimes of looting houses and endangering public security. Cima Lamu indignantly took the initiative to report the crimes of her husband and younger brother to the garrison and the work team, and personally led the troops to arrest them. The Tibetan compatriots in Shannan also vigorously assisted our army in recovering the military supplies hidden by the bandits. When our army arrived in the village of Lingdanhuo, Tibetan youth Baima Dorje immediately reported to our army the location of the warehouse where the bandits had secretly stored 10,000 catties of qing稞, more than 2,000 catties of tsampa, and 6,000 catties of horse grass in the village. Later, he discovered that the bandits had hidden three pistols and one rifle in Langkazi Zong, and quickly reported it to our army.

    山南藏胞布下天罗地网
    协助平叛部队捕捉散匪
    新华社拉萨2日电本社随军记者报道：西藏山南地区的藏胞主动捕捉被人民解放军击溃的零星散匪，或者将散匪情况迅速报告平叛部队加以搜剿，使零星散匪陷入天罗地网中。
    在江孜康饶村附近，有一天藏胞明玛汪堆和才旺多登两人正在田里春耕，遇到三个散匪前来向他们索取酥油和羊肉吃。这两个农民当时互相使了个眼色，由才旺多登假装着回村里取食物而回去报讯，明玛汪堆则在田里跟三个叛匪敷衍拖延时间，并且在估计村里已经准备好以后，支使两名叛匪进村去。不久，留在田里的那个叛匪看到从村里跑出来十多个藏族青年，手里都拿着绳子、木棍和皮鞭等，他一看不妙，立刻用刀猛砍明玛汪堆，跨上马想逃走，被明玛汪堆躲过，并把他拖下马来，互相扭打，前来捉匪的青年很快就赶到，把这个叛匪捆了起来。另外两个叛匪一进村子，全村一百多个农民从四面八方涌来，到处都是高喊“抓住叛匪！抓住叛匪”的声音，把这两个被吓得失魂落魄的叛匪逮住。村民们兴高彩烈地连夜把这三名叛匪押送到离村子一百多里路的江孜军事管制委员会。
    山南罗堆村藏胞达瓦登珠5月3日前往一座人迹罕至的海拔五千多公尺高的埃那山上放羊，发觉有十三名叛匪藏匿在山凹的一幢破庙中。叛匪要达瓦登珠送糌粑给他们吃。达瓦登珠当晚回村后，跟老人根刀巴登商量，决定第二天早晨由老人骑马奔向解放军驻地报告，同时由达瓦登珠给叛匪送糌粑，以免叛匪因为没东西吃又跑了。5月4日，老人带领部队登山包围了这幢人迹罕至的破庙，全部活捉了这十三名叛匪。
    山南扎其地区的则许村，是雅鲁藏布江南岸的一个渡口，这里住着以渡船为生的四户藏胞。一天晚上，有九个喇嘛模样的人前来探听是否有渡船以及解放军是否查渡口等情况。四户藏胞见他们行迹可疑，一面故意答应给这九个人作饭吃，一面派人去向解放军报告。当解放军赶到时，这批叛匪没来得及吃饭就全部落网了。
    在肃清散匪中，藏胞中还出现了许多动人事例。隆子宗妇女慈玛拉姆的丈夫和弟弟都参加了叛乱。在人民解放军和工作队到达当地后，她受到了教育，提高了觉悟，就几次前去找寻丈夫和弟弟，苦劝他们赶快放下武器，向人民解放军投降争取宽大处理。可是这两个叛匪执迷不悟，不听她的劝告，继续干着打家劫舍危害治安的罪恶勾当。慈玛拉姆便愤慨地主动向驻军和工作队检举了她的丈夫和弟弟的罪行，并且亲自带领部队把他们逮捕起来。山南藏胞还大力协助我军起获叛匪藏匿的军用物资。岭耽豁的藏族青年白玛多吉在我军到达这个乡村的时候，立刻向我军报告了叛匪在这个村子里暗藏着一万斤青稞、二千多斤糌耙和六千斤马草的仓库所在地。以后，他又发现叛匪在浪卡子宗藏匿了三支手枪和一杆步枪，又赶紧向我军报告。
