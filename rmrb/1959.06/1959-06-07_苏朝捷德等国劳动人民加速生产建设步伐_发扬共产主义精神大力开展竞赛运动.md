    Laboring People of the Soviet Union, Korea, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany Accelerate the Pace of Production and Construction
    Vigorously Carry Out Emulation Campaigns, and Promote the Communist Spirit
    More Than 100,000 Production Units in the Soviet Union
    Strive for the Title of "Communist Labor Brigade"
    (By Our Correspondent in Moscow, June 6) The mass production movement for striving for the title of "Communist Labor Brigade," which is widely launched throughout the Soviet Union, is in a state of growing consolidation. At present, more than 100,000 production workshops, sections, and groups in industrial enterprises, collective farms, and state farms across the Soviet Union have participated in this production movement; among them, more than 5,000 units have successively won the official title of "Communist Labor Brigade" because they have well fulfilled their guarantees.
    The production movement for striving for the title of "Communist Labor Brigade" has only been in existence and developed for half a year. Thanks to the active leadership of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and trade unions, as well as the vigorous development of the national-scale production competition for striving to complete the first year's production tasks of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, this production movement has been expanding and deepening day by day, and has achieved remarkable results in all aspects. According to statistics, all production units striving for the title of "Communist Labor Brigade" have completed their production plans ahead of schedule every month during these six months. Metallurgical enterprises in Magnitogorsk, Kuznetsk, and Ukraine, coal mines in Donbass, and machine manufacturing factories in Leningrad, Moscow, Sverdlovsk, and Kiev have all completed their production plans for the first five months of this year ahead of schedule. The production units striving for the title of "Communist Labor Brigade" are very active in these enterprises, and their production achievements are particularly remarkable. For example, the "Communist Labor Brigade" of the third open-hearth furnace workshop of Magnitogorsk has overfulfilled the production plan by 20% every month. The production units striving for the title of "Communist Labor Brigade" have also universally proposed to ensure the best quality for every product, and have also achieved good results in reducing costs.
    In rural areas, the production movement for striving for the title of "Communist Labor Brigade" has been further developed with the beginning of spring plowing and spring sowing. The names of "Communist Labor Brigade" members and agricultural machinery operators Manukovsky, Gitarov, and Denisenko are well-known throughout the Soviet Union. They pioneered the method of integrated mechanized corn farming teams, where two machinery operators cultivate 150 to 200 hectares of cornfields without the need for any manual labor. Now their advanced farming methods have been promoted throughout the Soviet Union and have been enthusiastically supported by the masses. Now, on all production fronts of industry and agriculture, the active efforts of "Communist Labor Brigade" members have converged into a powerful force driving the entire production forward.
    "Communist Labor Brigade" members have also become pioneers in realizing the Party's call. At present, laborers in various regions are using practical production achievements to greet the upcoming plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee. Countless "Communist Labor Brigades" have taken the lead in launching technical reform movements. The members of the "Communist Labor Brigade" of the press molding workshop of the Gorky Automobile Factory have recently, through collective efforts, designed and manufactured a semi-automated assembly line, which has increased production efficiency several times and can save the country 1.7 million rubles per year.
    In terms of learning and cultivating higher communist moral character, the production units striving for the title of "Communist Labor Brigade" have made great efforts and have achieved great results. Now, every member of the "Communist Labor Brigade" participates in different cultural and technical studies. All 101 members of a workshop's "Communist Labor Brigade" at the Kharkov Locomotive Factory have participated in cultural and technical studies. The "Communist Labor Brigade" members have also actively participated in social public labor, such as organizing worker pickets to maintain social order, planting trees, and cleaning houses and streets. New people and new things with the communist morality of "One for all, all for one" are emerging endlessly. Moscow, the leader of the "Communist Labor Brigade" of the Zhdanov Factory in Leningrad, said that since we organized the "Communist Labor Brigade," one of the most valuable results we have achieved is the enhanced friendship and unity among the members. Now, "I am for everyone, and everyone is for me" has become our conscious law of life.

    "Chollima Workteam" Movement Deeply Unfolds in Korean Factories and Mines
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang – The new socialist competition initiated by Korean workers in the upsurge of socialist construction—the "Chollima Workteam" movement, is being widely and deeply carried out in factories and mines in northern Korea. Many workteams are striving for the glorious title of "Chollima Workteam", excellently completing production tasks, and making efforts in cultivating communist ideology and improving technical and cultural levels.
    The Chen Yingyuan workteam of the Jiangxian Steel Plant first initiated this movement in March of this year and has already won the glorious title of "Chollima Workteam." In the past two months, they have not only completed the production tasks well, shortening the steelmaking time by two or three hours compared to last year, but also helped other workteams improve their technology.
    Since participating in this movement in March, the Zhu Chengri workteam of the Longcheng Machinery Factory has created a machine that can machine seven grooves at a time, increasing efficiency by five or six times. Their current production efficiency has increased five times compared to last year. Communist education has also been strengthened within the team, and it is required that everyone strive to improve one level technically this year.
    Now this movement has affected various economic and cultural departments. Train drivers and truck drivers have also put forward the slogan of striving for the "Chollima" locomotive or truck.

    Czechoslovakia Widely Carries out Labor Competition, New Atmosphere in Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    (By Our Correspondent in Prague, June 6) The competition movement for striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" is developing more widely and deeply throughout Czechoslovakia. So far, more than 4,000 large and small collectives have participated in this competition, with the most being in the coal and steel center of Ostrava Oblast. From the perspective of production departments, the machinery industry department ranks first. Not long ago, various states held meetings of activists of "Socialist Labor Brigades" to exchange experiences so that this competition could develop more healthily.
    This movement, which is considered to be able to promote production and cultivate new socialist people, has gained the enthusiastic support of the laboring people. They have shown their enthusiasm and interest in this competition with practical actions. For example, more than 80 machinery factories in Brno Oblast have guaranteed the overfulfillment of the first quarter plan due to the enthusiastic development of this competition. At present, they are working hard with full confidence to produce 316 million crowns (Czech currency) worth of products more in the second quarter. In the construction industry department, many collectives participating in this competition and all construction workers have jointly put forward the resounding slogan of completing the annual construction tasks one month ahead of schedule. They will also build more houses for the country with saved raw materials. This competition particularly attracts the vast number of young workers. In many states, almost half of those participating in this competition are youth collectives. Recently, a youth group from the famous Tatra Locomotive Factory established friendly relations with a "Communist Labor Brigade" from the Moscow Railway Station in the Soviet Union, exchanging experiences in work, life, and study.
    With the development of this competition, workers' political consciousness and moral character have been significantly improved. Many new atmospheres have emerged in the factory. Young workers have listed respecting and learning from older workers as one of their guarantee conditions. Older workers are also more enthusiastically and actively teaching their experience and technology to young people. The workers participating in this competition also strive for collective honor with model actions of strictly abiding by labor discipline, a high degree of mutual assistance and fraternity, and actively participating in various political lives.
    The Communist Party and government of Czechoslovakia, as well as trade unions, give deep care and support to this movement that promotes and cultivates new socialist people. First Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Novotny once said, "We sincerely welcome the development of the competition for striving for the title of 'Socialist Labor Brigade,' and we believe that it will help solve important problems and victoriously complete this year's production tasks."

    German Democratic Republic Vigorously Conducts Organization and Propaganda
    (By Our Correspondent) The competition movement for striving for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" is being widely carried out throughout the German Democratic Republic. At present, more than 1,500 production workteams have participated in this competition movement.
    This competition movement was developed by the "Nikolai Mamai" workteam of the Bitterfeld Electrochemical United Factory in Halle District. At the beginning of this year, this workteam called for the launch of the "Socialist Labor Brigade" competition within the factory. When this call was published in the newspaper, it immediately received responses from many young workers across the country.
    The Socialist Unity Party of Germany is very concerned about the development of the movement. Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Party Central Committee, in a document entitled "'Socialist Labor Brigade' and Propagandists," focused on the question of what is meant by "working, studying, and living in a socialist way" to propagandists. The document pointed out: To work in a socialist way means concentrating the strength of the entire collective, mutual assistance, and support to solve those problems, the solution of which will most quickly promote the advancement of the entire socialist society. Undoubtedly, this is currently the progress of science and technology.
    The document instructed propagandists: Propagandists can only have a correct understanding of the problems if they directly participate in the activities of various teams in the work of the enterprise and outside of work. Propagandists must study the development of the movement so as to be able to promote and popularize it. (Attached picture)

    苏朝捷德等国劳动人民加速生产建设步伐
    发扬共产主义精神大力开展竞赛运动
    苏联已有十万多个生产单位
    争取“共产主义劳动队”称号
    本报莫斯科6日电　在苏联各地广泛展开的争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的群众性生产运动，正处于日趋壮大巩固之中。目前，全苏各地工业企业、农庄和国营农场已有十万多个生产车间、工段和小组参加了这一生产运动；其中有五千多个单位，由于很好地完成了自己的保证，先后都正式荣获了“共产主义劳动队”称号。
    争取“共产主义劳动队”称号运动的产生与发展为时仅有半年，由于党、团和工会积极领导，以及全国规模的为争取提前完成七年计划第一年生产任务的生产竞赛的蓬勃展开，这个生产运动随之而日益扩大、深入，并在各方面获得显著成就。这半年里，据统计，所有的争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的生产单位都月月提前超额完成了生产计划。马格尼托哥尔斯克、库兹?茨克和乌克兰各地冶金企业，顿巴斯煤矿以及列宁格勒、莫斯科、斯维尔德洛夫、基辅的机器制造工厂，都提前完成了今年前五个月的生产计划。这些企业中争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的生产单位都非常活跃，生产成绩尤为显著。如马格尼托哥尔斯克第三平炉车间的“共产主义劳动队”，每个月都超额20％完成生产计划。争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的生产单位，还普遍提出要使每件产品保证最好质量，在减低成本方面也得到了很好成绩。
    在农村中，争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的生产运动，随着春耕春播的开始，得到了更大发展。“共产主义劳动队”队员、农业机械手马努科夫斯基、吉他洛夫和杰尼森科的名字已是全苏皆知了。他们首创了玉米综合机耕队方法，由两个机械手在不需任何手工劳动参加下，耕作一百五十到二百公顷的玉米地。现在他们的先进耕作法已在全苏各地推广，获得了群众热烈支持。现在，在工农业各生产战线上，“共产主义劳动队”队员们的积极努力，已汇成了一股推动整个生产前进的强有力的力量了。
    “共产主义劳动队”队员们也成为实现党的号召的先锋。目前，各地劳动者都在用实际生产成绩来迎接即将召开的苏共中央全会。无数“共产主义劳动队”首先起来，开展技术改革运动。高尔基汽车厂压模车间的争取“共产主义劳动队”队员们，最近在集体努力创造下，设计制成了一个半自动化的作业线，数倍地提高了生产效力，并每年可为国家节省一百七十万卢布。
    在学习与培养更高的共产主义道德修养方面，为争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的生产单位都作了很大努力，也获得了很大成绩。现在，每个“共产主义劳动队”队员都参加了不同的文化与技术学习。哈尔科夫机车厂一个车间“共产主义劳动队”的一百零一个人都参加了文化与技术学习。“共产主义劳动队”队员还积极参加了社会公共劳动，如组织工人纠察队，维持社会秩序，植树，清洁住房、街道等活动。“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义道德的新人新事层出不穷。列宁格勒日丹诺夫工厂“共产主义劳动队”队长莫斯科夫说，自从我们组织起“共产主义劳动队”后，我们获得的最宝贵的结果之一，就是队员之间的友谊和团结增强了。现在我为人人，人人为我，这已成为我们自觉的生活法律了。
    “千里马作业班”运动在朝鲜厂矿深入展开
    新华社平壤电　朝鲜工人在社会主义建设的高潮中发起的社会主义的新型竞赛——“千里马作业班”运动，正在朝鲜北部各厂矿企业中广泛深入地开展着。许多作业班为了争取“千里马作业班”的光荣称号，出色地完成着生产任务，并且在培养着共产主义思想、提高技术、文化水平等各方面进行努力。
    降仙炼钢厂陈应源作业班在今年3月首先发起这个运动，并且已经荣获“千里马作业班”的光荣称号。在这两个多月间，他们不仅很好的完成了生产任务，使炼钢时间比去年缩短了二、三个小时，还帮助别的作业班提高了技术。
    龙城机械厂的朱成日作业班自从3月参加这个运动以来，创造了一次能车七个槽的机器，提高效率五、六倍。他们目前的生产效率比去年提高了五倍。班内还加强了共产主义教育，并且要求今年内人人争取在技术上提高一级。
    现在这个运动已经影响到了各个经济和文化部门。火车司机、汽车司机们也提出了争取“千里马号”机车或汽车的口号。
    捷广泛开展劳动竞赛工矿企业中气象一新
    本报布拉格6日电　为争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛运动正在捷克斯洛伐克全国各地日益广泛深入的开展着。到目前为止，已有四千多个大小集体参加了这一竞赛，其中以煤钢中心奥斯特洛伐州最多。从生产部门来说，机械工业部门居于首位。不久前，各州都分别举行了“社会主义劳动队”积极分子会议，交流经验，以使这一竞赛能更健康地发展。
    这个被认为既能推动生产又能培养社会主义新人的运动，获得了劳动人民的热烈支持。他们以实际行动表明了对这一竞赛的热情和兴趣。如布尔诺州的八十多个机械工厂，由于这一竞赛开展得十分热烈，从而保证了第一季度计划的超额完成。目前他们正满怀信心地为第二季度多生产价值三亿一千六百万克朗（捷币）的产品而辛勤地劳动着。在建筑工业部门，许多参加这一竞赛的集体和全体建筑工人，一道提出了提前一个月完成全年建筑任务的响亮口号。他们还将以节约的原材料为国家多建筑一些房屋。这一竞赛特别吸引着广大的青年工人。在许多州里，参加这一竞赛的几乎有二分之一的是青年集体。最近，著名的塔特拉机车厂的一个青年小组和苏联莫斯科火车站的一个“共产主义劳动队”建立了友好联系，互相交流工作、生活和学习方面的经验。
    随着这一竞赛的开展，工人们的政治觉悟和道德品质都显著地提高了。工厂中出现了许多新气象。青年工人把尊重老工人、向老工人学习列为自己的保证条件之一。老工人也更热情积极地把自己的经验和技术教给青年。参加这一竞赛的工人也都以严格遵守劳动纪律、高度的互助友爱和积极参加各种政治生活的模范行动来争取集体的荣誉。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府以及工会，对这个促进和培养社会主义新人的运动给以深切的关怀和支持。捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼曾说，我们真诚地欢迎争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛的发展，我们相信它将能帮助解决重要的问题和胜利完成今年的生产任务。
    德意志民主共和国大力进行组织和宣传
    本报讯　争取“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的竞赛运动正在德意志民主共和国全国范围内广泛展开。目前已有一千五百多个生产工作队参加了这个竞赛运动。
    这个竞赛运动是由哈雷区比特菲尔德电气化学联合工厂“尼古拉·马马伊”工作队发展的。今年年初，这个工作队在厂内号召开展“社会主义劳动队”的竞赛，当这个号召在报上公布后，立即得到了全国许多青年工人的响应。
    德国统一社会党十分关怀运动的发展。最近党的中央宣传鼓动部在一个“‘社会主义劳动队’和宣传员”的文件中，向宣传员着重谈了什么叫“按照社会主义的方式来工作、学习和生活”的问题，文件指出：用社会主义方式劳动，也就是说把整个集体的力量、互助和支援集中去解决那些问题，这些问题的解决将最快地推动整个社会主义社会的前进。无疑目前这就是科学技术的进步。
    这个文件指示宣传员说：宣传员只有在企业的工作中和工作以外直接参加各个队的活动，才会对问题有正确的认识。宣传员必须研究运动发展的情况，以便能够加以促进和推广。（附图片）
