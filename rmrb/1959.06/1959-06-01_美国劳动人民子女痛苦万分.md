Xinhua News Agency, May 31st, New York Dispatch: Millions upon millions of children of American working people are enduring painful childhoods.

Most nurseries in the United States are private and charge exorbitant fees, which working people cannot afford. According to statistics, there are five million children from working-class families, and the education of preschool children in particular has become a serious problem.

Many families even have difficulty feeding their children, let alone educating them. Earlier this month, the "Worker's Weekly" reported from Cleveland that a divorced mother of three, Mrs. Wanda Jolewa, was jailed for begging on a busy street. The sign she wore around her neck while begging read: "For us, the recession is not over. We are starving." After her arrest, she told the police that her three children were five, seven, and ten years old.

Although millions of adults are unemployed in the United States, the Labor Department's report this year indicates that the number of child laborers in the United States has increased. The U.S. government's investigation revealed that from July 1957 to July 1958, U.S. factories and businesses illegally employed 11,634 children. A survey of 4,500 children working in tea gardens found that half were under the age of fourteen, and one-fifth were under the age of ten; some were even as young as six. The U.S. Department of Labor also stated that some children become permanently disabled or even die while working.

Under the corrupt and degenerate social atmosphere in the United States, an increasing number of American children are spending their years in prison. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover said on May 10 that half of all criminal cases in the United States last year were committed by juvenile offenders under the age of eighteen. According to figures from the New York Police Department, in New York City alone, 11,570 boys and girls under the age of sixteen were arrested last year. This figure is 17% higher than in 1957. Among juveniles of this age, crimes such as murder, assault, rape, theft, car theft, and carrying unlicensed weapons are constantly increasing. (Attached picture)

    美国劳动人民子女痛苦万分
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：美国千千万万劳动人民的子女在度着痛苦的童年。
    美国大部分托儿所是私立的，收费昂贵，劳动人民负担不起，据统计，有劳动人民家庭的儿童五百万，其中特别是学龄前儿童的教育成了严重的问题。
    有许多家庭甚至连哺养孩子都困难，更不用说教育孩子了。本月初，美国“工人周报”从克利夫兰报道说，一位有三个孩子的离了婚的母亲万达·乔累瓦夫人，因为在一条繁华的大街上讨乞而被关进监狱。她讨乞时脖子上挂着的一块牌子上写着：“对我们说来，衰退还没有过去。我们在挨饿。”她被捕后对警察说，她的三个孩子一个五岁，一个七岁，另一个十岁。
    虽然美国有几百万成年人失业，但是劳工部今年的报告指出，美国的童工人数已经增加。美国政府调查的结果指出，从1957年7月到1958年7月，美国工厂和企业非法雇用了一万一千六百三十四个儿童。在四千五百个在茶园中工作的儿童中进行的调查结果是，有一半人在十四岁以下，有五分之一的人在十岁以下，有些人甚至只有六岁。美国劳工部还说，有些儿童在工作中变成终身残废，甚至于死亡。
    在美国腐化堕落的社会风气下，越来越多的美国儿童正在监狱中度过他们的年月。美国联邦调查局局长埃德加·胡佛在5月10日说，美国去年的全部犯罪案件中，有一半是十八岁以下的少年犯的。根据纽约警察局的数字，单是在纽约市里，去年就有一万一千五百七十名十六岁以下的男孩和女孩被捕。这个数字比1957年增加17％。在这种年龄的少年中，谋杀、殴打、强奸、盗窃、偷窃汽车和携带无执照的武器等的犯罪行为不断增加。（附图片）
