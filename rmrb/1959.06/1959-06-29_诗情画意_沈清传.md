Poetic and Pictorial "The Tale of Shim Chong"
　　Hu Sha

After watching the Korean color opera film "The Tale of Shim Chong," I was moved by the scenery and reminded of the incomparably beautiful waters and mountains of Korea. The low, gentle thatched cottages, the wildflowers covering the mountains and plains, the uniquely beautiful peaks and verdant pines and cypresses, the waterfalls cascading down the cliffs, the boundless sea, and especially the hardworking and brave Korean people who love to sing and dance. "The Tale of Shim Chong," just from the filming of the exterior scenes and the handling of the settings, is enough to intoxicate people, not to mention the beautiful and touching story depicted through this environment.

I don't need to narrate the story; many people are familiar with it, because after "The Tale of Chun Hyang," "The Tale of Shim Chong" has also been staged in many cities and villages in our country, making it unforgettable. The story is not complicated, describing a girl named Shim Chong, whose mother died after she was born. Her blind father carried her around begging for milk to raise her, and the father and daughter depended on each other. Later, hearing that offering three hundred bags of white rice would restore her father's sight, she sold herself for the price of three hundred bags of rice and was thrown into the sea by wealthy merchants as a sacrifice. Her filial piety moved the gods, and the Jade Emperor ordered the Dragon King to welcome her as an honored guest. Later, she was sent back to the human world, became a queen, and was able to meet her father. The saddened father was overjoyed, and his eyes, which had been blind for forty years, opened again.

Is this just an ordinary story advising people to be filial? No, this story contains lofty and rich ideas, symbolizing the people's desire to pursue light and happiness at the cost of sacrificing everything.

"The Tale of Chun Hyang" and "The Tale of Shim Chong" are both collective creations of the Korean people and have been circulating among the people for many years. These are two works of art with very strong rebellious consciousness. As long as we think that these two works were created by the Korean people in the darkest era of their history, we can more deeply appreciate their meaning.

It is not an exaggeration that the Korean people regard "The Tale of Chun Hyang" and "The Tale of Shim Chong" as their artistic treasures. Because the Korean people have endowed these two works with beautiful artistic forms, ingenious structures, and vivid character images.

Both of these works can be called poetic dramas, and the entire drama is full of poetry.

When we watch the movie, we can appreciate many excellent seven-character poems on the screen. The rhymes are very neat, the meanings are very deep, and the poems are full of imagery. Of course, we should also thank the Chinese translators. I think many places are translated very well and have a lot of flavor. Korean culture has a deep connection with our culture. The Korean people also respect our Tang Dynasty poets Li Bai, Du Fu, and Bai Juyi as their own poets. So naturally, there are many similarities in poetic form.

When I say that the lyrics of "The Tale of Shim Chong" adopt the seven-character form, I mean that her author used the perfect form of poetry to express the emotions of the characters in the play.

Among them, there are several scenes, such as Shim Chong burning incense under the moon in the middle of the night, praying to heaven to let her father see the light again, and the actors singing with tears in their voices. Before throwing herself into the sea, Shim Chong pleaded to the sky again towards the raging waves, begging to give her father his sight back, and repeatedly instructed the merchant to return to her hometown of Peach Blossom Village to see if her father's eyes had opened. That was a thrilling scene. Another example is the chorus of the masses when the Sea Dragon King sent her back to the human world, which is a praise of her motherland and hometown. And the singing when she rode the descending fairy flower from the bottom of the sea to the lake of the royal palace, and the singing after she became queen, still yearning for her father to regain his sight, all fully developed the lyrical part of the drama due to the good arrangement of the scenes and the beautiful lyrics, leaving us with a deep impression and allowing us to appreciate many beautiful and moving lyrical poems.

The story of "The Tale of Shim Chong" is actually very complicated. Now it doesn't seem complicated to me because of the artists' refinement. Obviously, the playwrights expanded the lyrical part to meet the lyrical requirements of the opera. The narrative and explanation of the plot are lightly brushed over. For example, the appearance of the merchant and the monk only used a few shots, but more space was given to the lyrical part. That is, the dialogue part was reduced to a minimum, and the lyrics were increased, that is, the prose part of the play was compressed, and the poetry part was enhanced. This is why this play gives us a strong poetic impression.

Korean performing artists, such as the actors playing Shim Chong, Shim Bong-sa, Shim Chong's deceased mother, the Dragon King, and the King, all have rich emotions, beautiful voices, and outstanding acting skills. They portray the characters very vividly and convey the plot very perfectly.

Watching such a good movie is an aesthetic enjoyment. (Attached picture)

### 诗情画意“沈清传”

    诗情画意“沈清传”
    胡沙
    看了朝鲜彩色唱剧艺术片“沈清传”，触景生情，使我又回忆起了朝鲜的优美无比的水光山色。那低矮温柔的茅屋，那满山遍野的鲜花，那奇秀的山峰和青翠的松柏，那山崖上流下的瀑布，那一望无际的海波，尤其是那喜歌善舞的勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民。“沈清传”单从外景的拍摄和场景的处理，就够使人心醉的，更何况通过这个环境，描绘了一个优美动情的故事。
    故事不用我来叙述，许多人对它并不生疏，因为继“春香传”之后，“沈清传”也在我国的许多城市和乡村上演过，让人念念不忘。故事并不复杂，描写一个名叫沈清的少女，她出生后，母亲就死了，双目失明的父亲抱着她四处乞奶，将她养大，父女俩相依为命。后来听说用三百石白米上供，可使父亲眼睛复明，她就以三百石米身价自卖自身，被富商当作祭品投入海中。她的孝心感动了天神，玉皇命龙王迎她为上宾。后来又送她返回人间，作了王后，得与父亲相见。悲伤的父亲一阵惊喜，失明了四十年的双眼重又睁开了。
    这是一个普通的劝人行孝的故事么？不是的，这个故事蕴藏着崇高的丰富的思想，象征着为了追求光明和幸福而不惜牺牲一切的人民的意愿。
    “春香传”和“沈清传”都是朝鲜人民的集体创作，在民间流传了许多年。这是两部反抗意识十分强烈的艺术品，只要我们一想到这两部作品是朝鲜人民在历史上最黑暗的年代创作出来的，我们就能更深地体味到它的含义。
    朝鲜人民将“春香传”和“沈清传”当作他们的艺术珍宝看待，是一点也不过分的。因为朝鲜人民赋予了这两部作品以优美的艺术形式，巧妙的结构和鲜明的人物形象。
    这两部作品都称得起是诗剧，全剧诗意浓郁。
    我们看电影时，可以从银幕上欣赏到许多优秀的七言诗。格律都很整齐，含意都很深，诗句中饱含着形象。这当然也应当感谢汉语的翻译者，我认为许多地方翻译得很好，很有味道。朝鲜的文化和我国文化有着深切的联系。我国的唐代大诗人李白，杜甫，白居易，朝鲜人民也当作自己的诗人来尊敬。所以自然而然的在诗歌形式上有许多相通之处。
    我说“沈清传”的唱词采用了七言的形式，也就是说她的作者采用了完美的诗的形式来抒发剧中人的情感。
    其中有几段戏，如沈清半夜在月下焚香祈求上苍让父亲重见光明，演员歌唱得声泪俱下。沈清在投海以前向着惊涛骇浪又一次向上天恳求，一定要给她父亲睁开双眼，又再三嘱咐商人一定再回到她的故乡桃花村，看看她父亲的眼睛是否已经睁开了。那个激动人心的场面。又如海龙王送她重返人间的那一段群众合唱，那是对她的祖国和故乡的赞美。再如她乘着降仙花从海底升到王宫的湖中的那一段歌唱及当了王后之后仍念念不忙盼望父亲重见光明的歌唱，都由于情景安排的好和唱词写得美，使戏剧中的抒情部分得到了充分的发挥，给我们留下了深刻的印象，使我们欣赏到了许多优美动人的抒情诗。
    “沈清传”的故事其实是很复杂的。如今看起来使我感到不复杂，是由于艺术家提炼的结果。很显然，编剧家为了适应歌剧抒情的要求，把抒情的部分扩大了。把叙事和交待情节的部分就轻轻的一描而过，如那个商人和那个和尚的出现，只用了很少几个镜头，却把更多的篇幅给与了抒情部分。就是把对白部分减到了极少，把唱词增加了，也就是把剧中的散文部分压缩了，诗的部分增强了。这就是这出戏为什么给我们一种诗意浓郁的感染的缘故。
    朝鲜的表演艺术家，如扮演沈清、沈奉事、沈清的亡母、龙王及国王的演员，都具有充沛的情感、优美的歌喉和杰出的表演技巧，他们将人物形象刻画的很鲜明，将剧情传达得很完善。
    看一次这样的好电影，是一次美的享受。（附图片）
