Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 23rd: In the Yellow River flood area, a 11,000 mu wheat high-yield plot in the Naoli People's Commune of Changyuan County, Henan, achieved an average yield of 505.4 jin per mu, an increase of 1.07 times compared to the bumper year of 1958. The wheat on this contiguous high-yield plot has been dried and winnowed, with a total actual harvest of 5,557,360 jin.

The land in the Naoli Commune's high-yield plot is mostly silt land, mixed soil, greenish sandy soil, and alkaline land. It is also prone to flooding nine years out of ten, and has often suffered from water disasters. Cultivation in previous years was also very rough. In particular, last year it suffered the largest flood in more than 20 years. After the disaster, the commune party committee closely united the masses, worked together with one heart, and actively carried out production for self-salvation. The state also issued loans and transferred 380,000 jin of wheat seeds from other counties and communes. County leading organs also allocated them more than 3,000 pieces of agricultural machinery and farm tools of various sizes, and trained 300 technicians for them, ensuring the quality of wheat sowing.

Under the slogan of "Lose this year, gain next year, double the yield, and remove the disaster area label," Zhao Qipin, the first secretary of the commune party committee, and Chen Qingyun, the deputy director of the commune, led eight commune cadres to form a 10,000-mu wheat high-yield plot command, contracting teams and plots, and personally participating in management and command from planting to harvesting. Each brigade in the high-yield plot also established an "Eight-Character Constitution" technical team, which conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" from beginning to end in sowing and management. The sowing amount was generally around 25 jin, all of which were excellent varieties such as "Nanda 2419" and "Pingyuan 50." The land was generally deep-plowed, with about 10,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu. During the management process, 100 jin of soil fertilizer, 4,000 jin of human manure, and 6,000 to 10,000 jin of granular fertilizer were applied per mu. Last winter and this spring, the entire commune also organized 2,000 laborers to vigorously engage in Yellow River irrigation and farmland water conservancy projects, building 48 large and small canals. Combined with well irrigation, they timely irrigated the greening, jointing, and booting water, making the wheat grow fat and strong.

The wheat in the high-yield plot grew very well before the wheat harvest. The ears were large, numerous, and the grains were full. The largest ear had 147 grains. The masses happily said, looking at the huge wheat: This year we planted wheat, but we harvested beans. Encouraged by the bumper harvest, the commune members actively sold more surplus grain and good grain to the state. By the 17th, the entire commune had overfulfilled the summer grain unified purchase task.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 23rd: The Sunyuan Production Team of the Guangwu People's Commune in Shou County, Anhui Province, located in the Yellow River flood area, has provided a solid material foundation for implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture by vigorously developing household poultry and livestock sideline production. This year, the entire team's 660 mu of wheat has achieved a bumper harvest. After verifying the yield, the average yield per mu reached 504.62 jin, an increase of more than 1.4 times compared to last year. Among them, 25 mu of high-yield fields achieved a yield of 1,080 jin per mu.

Before the autumn plowing and sowing last year, the Sunyuan Production Team took out a total of 148,100 yuan from the total income of sideline production from autumn 1956 to 1958 to purchase 74 head of livestock, 16 double-wheeled double-shared plows, and 15 rakes. This gave the team the superior conditions of having many livestock and complete farm tools, which played a huge role in autumn plowing and sowing. Last autumn, all the wheat fields were first plowed with double-wheeled double-shared plows, and then plowed again with walking plows, changing the past phenomenon of rough cultivation caused by the lack of animal power and large farm tools, so that 660 mu of wheat fields were deeply plowed to more than one chi (foot). After plowing, they also harrowed four times each horizontally and vertically, achieving leveling and pulverization, and truly achieving deep plowing and fine cultivation. At the same time, they completed the autumn sowing task ten days ahead of schedule. The large number of poultry and livestock raised by the team provided a large amount of fertilizer for agricultural production. The entire team of 206 households of commune members raised a total of 979 pigs (excluding the fat pigs sold to the state) from autumn 1958 to now, an average of four pigs per household. The commune members also raised 528 sheep, 2,560 chickens, and 1,580 ducks. Therefore, a lot of pig, sheep, and other poultry and livestock manure was accumulated. The base fertilizer for the team's wheat fields was sufficient; during the wheat seedling greening, jointing, booting, and grain filling stages, more than 80 dan (a unit of weight) of pig and sheep manure were generally applied per mu. Due to the high fertilizer efficiency of pig and sheep manure, coupled with deep plowing and close planting (sowing amount of 30 to 35 jin per mu), and meticulous field management, the wheat growth this year reached strong stalks, no lodging, large ears, and full grains.

From last autumn to the first quarter of this year, the production team sold 410 pigs collectively raised by the production team to the state alone, earning 13,050 yuan. The commune members also actively deposited the money from sideline income into the credit cooperative. Due to the large sideline income and sufficient funds, the production team has bought 19 more heads of livestock, 6 horse-drawn water carts, 14 dragon bone water carts, and more than 115,000 jin of various chemical fertilizers and pesticides since the beginning of this year. These means of production have played a great role in the growth of crops and the prevention and control of various natural disasters. For example, when sowing wheat, they used "666" powder and Xilixing chemicals to mix the seeds, effectively preventing underground pests and ensuring full and vigorous seedlings. During the flowering and grain filling period of wheat, 93 mu of wheat were found to have sticky insects, but after the timely prevention and control of "666" powder, the wheat was not affected by pests and diseases. Before the Spring Festival, there was no rain for two months, but because the production team had many water lifting tools, the entire team's wheat fields were universally irrigated once in three days, ensuring the water needed by the wheat seedlings.

Before developing sideline production, the Sunyuan Production Team had low grain yields due to the lack of funds, livestock, and farm tools, coupled with the habit of extensive planting and low harvest over the years. In order to get rid of this backward state, the team, on the one hand, built farmland water conservancy and changed the habit of extensive planting and low harvest; on the other hand, it developed pig raising and other sideline production. As a result of the comprehensive development and close integration of agricultural and sideline production, grain production has greatly increased, and the appearance of the production team has undergone great changes. In the past, this area had five lacks: lack of livestock, lack of farm tools, lack of firewood trees, lack of grain, and lack of pigs and sheep. The current situation is: granaries are full, ponds are full of fish, pig, sheep, chicken and duck pens are full, and cattle, donkeys, and mules are tied in rows. At present, the team is conscientiously summarizing the experience of sideline production promoting agricultural production.

### 抓丰产方为增产立标兵　发展副业给土地添力量  黄泛区两片小麦齐登丰产榜  恼里公社一万多亩增产一倍多，光武公社六百多亩亩产超过五百斤

    抓丰产方为增产立标兵　发展副业给土地添力量
    黄泛区两片小麦齐登丰产榜
    恼里公社一万多亩增产一倍多，光武公社六百多亩亩产超过五百斤
    据新华社郑州23日电　在黄泛滩区上，河南长垣县恼里人民公社的一片一万一千亩小麦丰产方，平均亩产达到五百零五斤四两，比丰收的1958年增加一点零七倍。这一片相连的丰产方上的小麦已经晒干扬净，共实收五百五十五万七千三百六十斤。
    恼里公社丰产方的土地多是淤地、两合土地、青沙地和碱地，而且十年九淹，常闹水灾，往年耕作也非常粗糙。特别去年遭受了二十多年来最大的洪水侵袭，受灾后，公社党委紧紧团结群众，同心协力，积极开展生产自救。国家也发放了贷款，并从外县、外社调来三十八万斤麦种。县领导机关还拨给他们农业机械和大小农具三千多件，为他们训练技术员三百人，保证了麦播质量。
    “今年丢，明年捞、产量翻一番，摘掉灾区帽”，在这个口号下，社党委第一书记赵奇品和副社长陈庆云带领八名社干部，组成万亩小麦丰产方指挥部，包队包片，从种到收，亲自参加管理指挥。丰产方里的各个大队，也成立了“八字宪法”技术小组，在播种和管理中，从始至终认真执行了“八字宪法”。下种一般在二十五斤左右，全部是“南大二四一九”、“平原五零”等优良品种。土地普遍进行了深翻，每亩施底肥一万斤左右，在管理过程中，每亩又追土化肥一百斤、人粪尿四千斤、粒肥六千至一万斤。去冬今春，全社又组织二千名劳力，大搞引黄灌溉和田间水利工程，修大、小渠道四十八条，结合水井灌溉，及时浇了返青、拔节、孕穗水，使小麦长的又肥又壮。
    丰产方的小麦，在麦收前，生长非常好。穗大、穗多、粒饱，最大的穗有一百四十七粒，群众看着硕大的麦子高兴的说：今年种的是麦，收的是豆。在大丰收的鼓舞下，社员们积极多卖余粮、卖好粮给国家。到17日止，全社就已超额完成了夏粮统购任务。
    新华社合肥23日电　地处黄泛区的安徽省首太县光武人民公社孙园生产队，由于大力发展家禽家畜副业生产为贯彻农业“八字宪法”提供了雄厚的物质基础，今年全队六百六十亩小麦获得了大丰收。这些小麦经过核实产量，平均每亩达到五百零四斤十二两，比去年增产一点四倍多。其中有二十五亩高额丰产田，亩产量更达到一千零八十斤。
    去年秋耕秋种前，孙园生产队从1956年到1958年秋的副业生产总收入中共拿出了十四万八千一百元购买了牲口七十四头，双轮双铧犁十六部，耙十五盘，从而使这个队具备了牲畜多，农具齐全的优越条件，在秋耕秋种中发挥了巨大作用。去秋麦田全部用双轮双铧犁先犁，再用步犁套犁，改变了过去因缺乏畜力和大型农具造成的耕作粗放的现象，使六百六十亩麦田深耕达一尺以上。犁后，又横竖各耙四遍，达到耙平耙碎，真正做到了深耕细作。同时，提前十天完成了秋种任务。这个队饲养的大批家禽家畜，为农业生产提供了大批肥料。全队二百零六户社员，从1958年秋到现在共饲养生猪九百七十九头（出售给国家的肥猪除外），平均每户养四头，社员们还饲养了羊五百二十八头，鸡二千五百六十只，鸭一千五百八十只。因此积的猪、羊粪和其他家禽家畜的粪肥很多。全队麦田基肥充足；在麦苗返青、拔节、孕穗、灌浆时，每亩又普遍追施了猪、羊粪八十余担。由于猪、羊粪肥效高，加上深耕密植（每亩播种量三十斤到三十五斤），和细致的田间管理，就使得今年小麦生长达到秸秆茁壮，不倒伏，穗大，籽粒饱满。
    这个队从去年秋天到今年第一季度，仅生产队集体饲养的生猪就卖给国家四百一十头，收入一万三千零五十元。社员们也积极地将副业收入的钱存入信用部。由于副业收入大，资金足，生产队从今年年初到现在又买了牲口十九头，买了马拉水车六部，龙骨水车十四部，各种化肥、农药十一万五千多斤。这些生产资料对农作物的生长和防治各种自然灾害起了很大的作用。例如小麦下种时，他们全部用“六六六”粉和西力生药剂拌种，有效地防止了地下害虫，保证了苗全苗旺。在小麦扬花灌浆时期，发现有九十三亩小麦生了粘虫，但是经过“六六六”药粉的及时防治，小麦未受病虫害影响。在春节前，有两个月没有下雨，但是由于生产队提水工具多，全队麦田在三天内就普遍车水灌溉了一遍，保证了麦苗需要的水分。
    孙园生产队在未发展副业生产以前，由于资金少和缺乏牲畜、农具，加上历年来广种薄收的习惯，粮食产量很低。为了摆脱这种落后状态，这个队一方面兴修农田水利，改变广种薄收习惯；一方面又发展养猪等副业生产。农副业生产全面发展和密切结合的结果，粮食产量大大提高了，生产队的面貌有了很大改变。过去这个地区有五少：牲口少，农具少，柴草树木少，粮食少，猪羊少。现在的情况是：粮满仓，鱼满塘，猪羊鸡鸭满圈，牛驴骡马拴成行。目前，这个队正在认真总结副业生产促进农业生产的经验。
