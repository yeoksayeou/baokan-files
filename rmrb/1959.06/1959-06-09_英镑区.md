　　The Sterling Area is an economic group formed by Britain and is also within Britain's sphere of financial influence. Like the Dollar Area and the Franc Area, it is an exclusive monetary area used by imperialist financial oligarchs to exert economic control.

　　The Sterling Group was organized in 1931. At that time, the economic crisis of 1929-1933 intensified the struggle between imperialists for world markets. Britain was forced to abandon the gold standard, and the pound's status as a "world currency" was undermined. In order to protect its own economic and financial positions, and to increase its competitive strength with the United States and other imperialists, Britain united the countries within its empire and some countries that had close economic, financial, and political ties with Britain, and established this group.

　　During World War II, in order to consolidate the Sterling Group, Britain legally fixed the relationship between the member countries of this group, thereby establishing the Sterling Area. However, the number of countries participating in the Sterling Area has decreased. Currently, the Sterling Area includes the Commonwealth countries (except Canada), as well as Ireland, Burma, Iraq, Iceland, Jordan, and Libya.

　　Trade and credit between member countries of the Sterling Area are settled in pounds. The currencies of member countries must maintain a certain ratio with the pound. Their gold and foreign exchange must also be deposited in the Bank of England in London and cannot be used without British permission. The surplus that Sterling Area countries obtain in trade with Britain is not paid in cash by Britain, but is recorded as a Sterling balance. This money can only be used within the Sterling Area, and countries cannot freely convert it into US dollars or other foreign currencies without British permission. (Storage)

    英镑区
    英镑区是英国组成的经济集团，也是英国的金融势力范围。它和美元区、法郎区一样都是帝国主义金融寡头进行经济控制的一种排他性的货币区域。
    英镑集团是1931年组织起来的。那时，1929年—1933年的经济危机使帝国主义之间争夺世界市场的斗争尖锐化。英国被迫放弃金本位制，英镑的“世界货币”地位遭到了破坏。英国为了保护自己的经济和金融阵地，并增加同美国及其他帝国主义的竞争力量，因而联合了帝国内各国和一些在经济上、财政上、政治上与英国有密切联系的国家，建立了这个集团。
    第二次世界大战时，英国为了巩固英镑集团，便用法律形式把这个集团的成员国的关系固定下来，从而成立了英镑区。但是，参加英镑区的国家有了减少。目前英镑区除了包括英联邦国家外（加拿大除外），还有爱尔兰、缅甸、伊拉克、冰岛、约旦和利比亚。
    英镑区各成员国间的贸易和信用都用英镑进行结算。成员国的货币必须与英镑保持一定的比率。它们的黄金外汇也必须存在伦敦的英格兰银行，不经英国许可，不得动用。英镑区国家在与英国贸易中所获得的盈余，英国不付现款，只记一笔账作为英镑结存。这笔钱只能在英镑区使用，不得英国许可，各国不能把它自由兑换成美元或其他外币。　（存）
