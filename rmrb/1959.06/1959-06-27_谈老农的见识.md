We beginners in agricultural work often expend a lot of effort and sweat more than others in the fields. However, our progress is often slow, and old farmers, seeing this, bluntly say: "You're making a mess of it!"

There are subtleties to farming, no matter how small the task. Even with something as simple as holding a hoe, the old farmers can tell you a lot, and they have many insightful sayings. When you try it according to what they say, it really works. Not only are you less tired, but the progress is faster and the quality is better.

Some old farmers can look at the sky, observe the wind direction, and even observe the movements of birds, beasts, insects, and fish to arrive at a weather forecast that is largely accurate. Some old farmers can recognize hundreds of herbs and use them to treat common minor illnesses in the countryside. Even young people who grew up in the countryside don't have this skill, let alone those of us who have just been sent down to the countryside. This can't help but remind one of the saying: "Older people have eaten more salt than young people have eaten rice." Rich agricultural knowledge is accumulated in their bellies over the years. Take holding a hoe, for example. How does one do it most appropriately? They themselves probably went through a period of exploration, experimentation, and comparison before becoming skilled and finally finding the most labor-saving and perfect method. In this sense, the old farmer teaching how to hold a hoe is precisely to let us avoid taking detours and not repeat their past slow journey. Therefore, the experience of the old farmers is worth learning from and using as a reference.

People who can be called old farmers have probably been farming for decades. They deal with the land year after year. In their struggle with nature, they finally win fruits, win knowledge, and also train and cultivate their skillful hands. We should learn their production knowledge and technology, and learn from their production experience. This is the first point.

Old farmers have a thorough understanding of the local human and natural environment. They can recount the history of the village, the old stories of whose ancestors, and the changes in the mountains and rivers like enumerating one's family treasures. Shouldn't we learn this living and valuable historical knowledge from the old farmers? Wouldn't we make fewer mistakes if we understood all this before acting? This is the second point.

More importantly, old farmers are mostly people who have experienced the vicissitudes of life. They have suffered the hardships of life, and many of them are poor or hired peasants. Now that they have changed their lives, looking back on the past and thinking about the present, they have many feelings. This also determines that they are not only experts in production, but also people with socialist enthusiasm. If you ask them how to live, they will tell you some valuable advice on how to live based on their own experiences. This is the third point.

Unfortunately, not everyone now understands the need to respect the insights of old farmers. Some of us have not developed the habit of consulting with old farmers and asking them for advice when problems arise. I have no intention of sanctifying everything about old farmers. Young people do know more about some new things and accept them faster than old farmers. Here, young people can also help old farmers to make up for their shortcomings after consulting with them.

    谈老农的见识
    江之水
    我们初学农事的人，在田里干活，常常是力气费了，汗也比别人流得多，但进度常常很慢，而且老农看了，总还是直爽地说上一句：搞得不成器！
    做庄稼活儿，不分巨细，都是很有讲究的，就连怎样拿锄头，老农也可以给你讲出许多名堂来，而且有很多精辟的口诀。按他说的试了，果然灵验，既不那么累了，而且，进度也快、质量也好了。
    有的老农，看看天色，望望风向，甚至观察观察鸟兽虫鱼的动静，就可以得出大体符合实际的天气预报来。有的老农，可以识百草，会用它医治些农村常见的小疾病。这连在农村生长的年轻人也还没有这一套本事，何况是我们这些刚刚下放去的？这不由得让人想起一句俗话：上了年纪的人，吃的盐也要比后生们吃的米多。在他们肚子里日积月累地蕴藏了丰富的农业知识。就拿握锄来说，究竟怎样才算是最合适，恐怕他自己也经历过一段摸索、试验、比较的时期，然后由不熟练变为熟练，以致最后得到了一个最省力、最完美的办法。从这个意义上说，老农教握锄，也正是让我们免走冤枉路，不再重复他们过去的一段缓慢的跋涉。因此，老农的经验、经历是值得我们学习、借鉴的。
    能称老农的人恐怕种了有几十年的地了，他们年复一年地和大地打交道，他们在和大自然的搏斗中，最后赢得了果实，赢得了知识，也锻炼和培养了他们灵巧的双手。我们学习他们的生产知识和技术，学习他们的生产经验，这是第一。
    老农对于一个地方的人文自然情况是了如指掌的。本村本乡的历史，谁家祖辈的老事，以及这山川河流的变迁，他们都可以如数家珍。我们不是正可以向老农学习这些活的宝贵的历史知识吗？让我们了解这一切再行动，不就更少差误了吗？这是二。
    更重要的一点，还因为老农多是饱经沧桑的过来人，他们遭受过生活的磨折，他们很多是贫雇农。如今他们换了个人间生活，抚今思昔，感慨很多，这也就决定他们不仅是生产上的里手，还是个有社会主义积极性的人。请教他一下该如何生活，他会从自己的经历里，把切身的感受，告诉你一些关于如何生活的金玉良言。这又是三。
    可惜的是现在还不是所有的人都懂得了要尊重老农的见识，我们还有些人没有养成遇事善于和老农商量，向他们请教的习惯。我并无意就此把老农的一切都神圣化了，有些新鲜东西年青人确实还是比老农知道得多，接受得快。在这里，年青人也可在请教老农之余，来帮助老农，以补其不足之处。
