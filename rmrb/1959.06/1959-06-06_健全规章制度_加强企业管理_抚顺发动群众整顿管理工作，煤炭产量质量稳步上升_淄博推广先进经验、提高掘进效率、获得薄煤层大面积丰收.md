Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 5th. Fushun Coal Mine, in the increase production and practice economy movement, mobilized the masses to establish rules and regulations, comprehensively strengthened enterprise management, and coal production and quality steadily increased. In April, the average daily output of raw coal for the entire mine was 48,000 tons, and now the daily output has stabilized above 50,000 tons.

After the national coal mine large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition movement began, coal production at Fushun Coal Mine had greatly improved. However, due to relatively chaotic management work, poor face specifications and quality, and an increase in mechanical and roof accidents, the continued rise in production levels was hindered. After analyzing this situation, the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Mining Area Party Committee believed that only by comprehensively improving management levels could coal production be built on a solid and reliable foundation. Therefore, it required all units to establish and improve rules and regulations to ensure that increased production and conservation were achieved on the basis of normal face specifications and quality, normal safety, normal production and rest for workers, and improved labor productivity, face utilization, and equipment utilization.

According to the instructions of the Municipal Committee and the Mining Area Party Committee, a mass movement to rectify enterprise management was launched throughout the mine in mid-April. In less than half a month, employees put forward more than 100,000 suggestions for improvement targeting certain chaotic situations in current enterprise management, and after repeated investigation and research, established more than a dozen rules and regulations, including technical management, safety inspection, product acceptance, mechanical maintenance and repair, tool and equipment management, and various operating procedures. Many effective advanced experiences have been incorporated into the rules and regulations. In order to improve face specifications and quality and increase underground operation rates, in late April, each mine organized hundreds of shock teams to rush to repair belt conveyors, pipe tracks, chute tracks, and ventilation roadways underground, clean up underground environmental hygiene, and organize inspection teams to go deep underground to supervise the implementation of relevant rules and regulations. After more than half a month, the quality of roadways and faces in these mines generally met specifications. Workers excitedly said, "In the past, we had to bend over or crawl to enter the face, but now we can stand up straight without hitting our heads!" The stripping work at the West Open-pit Mine lagged behind coal mining, greatly affecting safety and output. In April, Fushun Coal Mine, by tapping the potential of existing equipment, transferred eight locomotives and dozens of ore cars to this mine to support them in strengthening stripping work. It is expected that the abnormal phenomenon of stripping lagging behind coal mining can be reversed in the third quarter. After implementing various rules and regulations, the Tiger Platform Mine experienced a reduction of more than half in filling accidents in May compared to the previous month, and a 28% reduction in production-affecting liability accidents.

In order to ensure the implementation of various rules and regulations, comprehensively strengthen enterprise management, each mine also established a responsibility system for leaders at all levels, appropriately adjusted functional organizations, and strengthened the cadres of workshops, teams, and groups. At the same time, each mine successively opened spare-time training classes for coal mining team and group leaders. The main leading cadres of the mine went down to the well with the team and group leaders during the day to solve key problems, and summarized their work, exchanged experiences, and discussed how to improve operation quality in the evening, thus universally improving the management level of coal mining team and group leaders.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th. In the high-quality and high-yield competition movement, Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong Province paid attention to promoting advanced experience and strengthening enterprise management, and achieved large-scale bumper harvests in thin coal seams. In March, the thirty-seven regular coal mining faces of this mining bureau each produced an average of 7,245 tons of coal; in April, forty regular coal mining faces each produced an average of 7,510 tons of coal; in May, forty regular coal mining faces each produced an average of 7,642 tons of coal. All reached the bumper harvest standards stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry, of which six also created high-yield bumper harvest records of 10,000 to 13,000 tons per month.

The characteristics of the coal mines under the Zibo Mining Bureau are: thin coal seams, old mines, many faults, and broken roofs; most of the existing regular coal mining faces have a coal seam thickness of only 0.7 to 0.8 meters, and production conditions are relatively difficult. After the workers launched a large-scale bumper harvest competition in early March, the daily output level of the entire bureau rapidly increased, but at that time, there were not many regular working faces that met the bumper harvest standards. The Mining Bureau Party Committee decided to vigorously promote advanced experiences such as lengthening the cutting disc of the coal cutter and multi-cycle, double-cycle, etc., according to the different situations of each mine, to increase the "unit area" output of each working face. At present, of the 46 coal cutters in each mine, 21 have lengthened the cutting disc from the original 1.8 meters to 2.2 to 2.8 meters, which has increased the production capacity of the working face by 34% without increasing equipment and personnel, and can cut 1,628 tons more coal per day, which is equivalent to newly adding eight working faces; Fifteen short working faces with a length of less than 60 meters have changed from single-cycle to double-cycle or triple-cycle, producing more than 1,400 tons of coal per day; the "one cut, one shot" coal mining method has been promoted on four coal mining working faces that cannot implement multi-cycle or long cutting discs, which has also increased coal production. With the acceleration of the recovery progress, each coal mining team has also promoted advanced experiences such as fast coal cutting, fast shifting of chutes, and fast supporting and dismantling of pillars, so that each production link is closely linked, and comprehensive improvement is achieved.

In the past, Zibo Mining Bureau checked the completion of the production plan of each mine once a day, but now it checks three times a day. At the same time, the system of the director, chief engineer, mine director and engineer being on duty in the dispatching room was restored, and 113 kinds of on-site management systems were restored and established, including regular mechanical maintenance, job responsibility system and on-site handover system, so that the production order of each mine was normal and the production efficiency was improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th. Shandong Zibo Mining Bureau is strengthening tunneling work to prepare for ensuring raw coal production. In May, the main roadways of each mine tunneled 18,107 meters, an increase of more than 3% compared with April, and 18 regular coal mining faces were developed ahead of schedule.

In early May, the Party Committee of Zibo Mining Bureau comprehensively inspected and analyzed the overall coal production situation, and found that from January to April, the amount of coal obtained decreased month by month due to the tunneling speed of the main roadways lagging behind the coal mining speed. In mid-May, the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau held three telephone conferences in succession, using methods such as detailed accounting and comparison, to emphasize the importance of strengthening tunneling work. Since mid-May, each mine has made plans to grasp tunneling by shift and by day, and established and improved the tunneling leadership organization. Hongshan Coal Mine also specially established a rapid tunneling leading group to analyze the tunneling situation in a timely manner and solve key problems. The daily tunneling progress of the main roadways of the entire mine increased from 196.5 meters in the first half of May to 214 meters in the second half of May.

By the end of May, each mine had transferred a total of 220 workers to strengthen the tunneling force, and added 31 pneumatic drills, some drill bits, air compressors, and winches to the tunneling working face, and promoted more than 20 advanced tunneling experiences, so that the daily progress gradually increased. Now, Zibo Mining Bureau is further adjusting manpower and equipment and materials, preparing to add 47 more tunneling working faces in June, so that the daily tunneling progress of the main roadways can reach 700 meters.

    健全规章制度　加强企业管理
    抚顺发动群众整顿管理工作，煤炭产量质量稳步上升
    淄博推广先进经验、提高掘进效率、获得薄煤层大面积丰收
    新华社抚顺5日电　抚顺煤矿在增产节约运动中，发动群众大立规章制度，全面加强企业管理，煤炭的产量质量稳步上升。4月份，全矿原煤平均日产四万八千吨，现在日产量已经稳定在五万吨上面。
    抚顺煤矿在全国煤矿大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动开始后，煤炭产量曾经有很大提高。但是由于管理工作比较混乱，掌子规格质量不好，机械、顶板事故增多，障碍了生产水平继续上升。中共抚顺市委和矿区党委分析了这一情况后，认为只有全面提高管理水平，才能使煤炭产量建立在稳固可靠的基础上。因此要求各单位建立和健全规章制度，保证在掌子规格质量正常、安全正常、职工生产休息正常和提高劳动生产效率、提高掌子面利用率、提高设备利用率的基础上，达到增产节约的目的。
    根据市委和矿区党委的指示，全矿在4月中旬展开了整顿企业管理的群众运动。不到半个月，职工们就针对当前企业管理的某些混乱情况，提出了十万多条改进意见，并且经过反复调查研究建立了技术管理、安全检查、产品验收、机械维护检修、工具设备管理和各种作业规程等十几种规章制度。许多行之有效的先进经验都被吸收到规章制度里来了。为了搞好掌子规格质量，提高井下作业率，各矿在4月下旬就组织起上百个突击队，分别在井下突击修理皮带道、管子道、溜子道和通风巷道等，清扫井下环境卫生，并且组织检查团深入井下督促贯彻执行有关规章制度。经过半个多月的时间，这些矿井的巷道和掌子质量普遍合乎规格，工人们兴奋地说：“过去进掌子得弯着腰或爬着走，现在直着腰板也碰不着脑袋！”西露天矿的剥离工作落后于采煤，大大影响了安全和产量。4月份抚顺煤矿通过挖掘现有设备潜力，为这个矿调来了八台机车和数十台矿石车，支援他们加强剥离工作。预计在第三季度剥离落后于采煤的不正常现象就可以扭转。老虎台矿贯彻各项规章制度后，5月份充填事故比上月减少一半以上，影响生产的责任事故减少了28％。
    为了保证各项规章制度的贯彻执行，全面加强企业管理，各矿还建立了各级领导责任制，适当地调整了职能机构，充实了车间、班、组的干部。与此同时，各矿先后开办了采煤班、组长业余训练班，矿上的主要领导干部白天和班、组长一起下井解决关键问题，晚上通过总结工作，交流经验，讨论提高作业质量问题，因而普遍提高了采煤班、组长的管理水平。
    新华社济南5日电　山东省淄博矿务局在优质高产竞赛运动中，注意推广先进经验和加强企业管理，获得了薄煤层大面积丰产。3月份这个矿务局的三十七个正规采煤工作面，平均各产煤七千二百四十五吨；4月份四十个正规采煤面平均各产煤七千五百一十吨；5月份四十个正规采煤工作面平均各采煤七千六百四十二吨。全部达到了煤炭工业部规定的丰产标准，其中有六个还创造了月产一万吨到一万三千吨的高额丰产纪录。
    淄博矿务局所属煤矿的特点是：煤层薄，矿井老，断层多，顶板破碎；现有的正规采煤工作面中，绝大部分煤层厚度仅零点七到零点八公尺，生产条件比较困难。3月初，职工开展大面积丰产竞赛之后，全局的日产水平迅速提高，但是当时达到丰产标准的正规工作面还不多。矿务局党委决定根据各矿不同情况，大力推广加长截煤机截盘和多循环、双循环等先进经验，增加各工作面的“单位面积”产量。目前，各矿四十六台截煤机中，已有二十一台将截盘由原来的一点八公尺加长到二点二至二点八公尺，在不增加设备和人员的情况下，使工作面的生产能力提高了34％，每天能多截煤一千六百二十八吨，等于新增加了八个工作面；十五个长度在六十公尺以下的短工作面由单循环改为双循环或三循环，每天多产煤一千四百多吨；在四个不能实行多循环或长截盘的采煤工作面上，推行了“一刀一炮”采煤法，也提高了煤产量。随着回采进度的加快，各个采煤队又推广了快速截煤、快速移溜子、快速支撤柱子等先进经验，做到各个生产环节环环扣紧，全面提高。
    过去，淄博矿务局每天检查一次各矿生产计划完成情况，现在每天要检查三次。同时恢复了局长、总工程师和矿长、工程师在调度室值班的制度，恢复和建立一百一十三种现场管理制度，其中包括机械定期维修、工作岗位制和现场交接班制度等，使各矿的生产秩序正常，生产效率提高。
    新华社济南5日电　山东淄博矿务局加强掘进工作，为保证原煤生产作好准备。5月份，各矿主要巷道掘进了一万八千一百零七公尺，比4月份提高3％以上，并提前开拓出十八个正规采煤工作面。
    5月初，淄博矿务局党委全面检查和分析了全局煤炭生产情况，发现1至4月份由于主要巷道掘进速度落后于采煤速度，获得煤量逐月减少。5月中旬矿务局党委连续召开了三次电话会议，用算细账、对比等办法，强调指出加强掘进工作的重要性。各矿从5月中旬开始，都作到了按班、按日抓掘进的计划，并且建立和健全了掘进领导机构。洪山煤矿还专门成立了快速掘进领导小组，及时分析掘进情况和解决关键问题。使全矿5月下半月主要巷道的每天掘进进度由上半月的一百九十六点五公尺提高到二百一十四公尺。
    到5月底，各矿共抽调了二百二十名工人充实掘进力量，并给掘进工作面增加了三十一台风钻，一部分打眼钎子、压风机和绞车等，并且推广了二十多种先进的掘进经验，使日进度逐步增加。现在，淄博矿务局正在进一步调整人力和设备器材，准备在6月份再增加四十七个掘进工作面，使主要巷道的日掘进进度达到七百公尺。（附图片）
