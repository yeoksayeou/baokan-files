Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 18th: Shaanxi areas that have finished harvesting wheat have launched a second-harvesting campaign. According to incomplete statistics from eight counties and cities, including Dali, Xingping, Weinan, Xi'an, and Xianyang, over 11.76 million jin of clean wheat has already been gleaned.

As of June 15th, more than 62.4% of the wheat in Shaanxi Province had been harvested. With the exception of northern Shaanxi and western Guanzhong areas, southern Shaanxi and eastern Guanzhong areas have basically completed harvesting. Because of the large harvest this year, coupled with day and night rushing to harvest in wind and rain, the phenomenon of scattered ears and lost grains was quite serious. According to inspections by the Provincial Summer Harvest Command, some areas had more than ten jin of scattered wheat ears per mu, with individual areas reaching twenty to thirty jin. In response to this situation, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee convened a telephone conference, criticizing the idea that "in a year of good harvest, it doesn't matter if a little is scattered," and demanded that all summer grain scattered in the fields and roads be gleaned immediately. People's communes in various places quickly launched a new high tide of secondary summer harvesting. Xingping County organized more than 3,500 professional wheat-gleaning teams to glean wheat in the fields. In Weinan County, 36,000 auxiliary laborers from the Gushi, Guandao, and Huayin communes have each gleaned an average of 46 jin of wheat in the past five or six days.

Various localities conducted thorough ideological work when launching the secondary summer harvest. Then, they divided the work into assigned areas by team and group, organized inspection teams, and conducted mutual inspections and acceptance tests. Wheat fields that were not gleaned cleanly were re-gleaned. Communes in various places gave their members a certain amount of compensation for the wheat ears and grains they gleaned.

    复收复打　聚沙成塔
    陕西八个县市拾回净麦一千多万斤
    新华社西安18日电　陕西割完小麦的地区开展了复收运动。据大荔、兴平、渭南、西安、咸阳等八个县（市）不完全统计，已拾回净麦一千一百七十六万多斤。
    截止15日，陕西省的小麦已经收割了62.4％以上。除陕北和关中西部地区以外，陕南和关中东部地区，已经基本割完。由于今年收割量大，加上日夜冒着风雨抢收，遗穗掉粒现象相当严重。据省夏收指挥部检查，有些地区每亩抛撒麦穗达十斤以上，个别地区达到二十斤到三十斤。针对这种情况，中共陕西省委和省人民委员会召开了电话会议，批判了“丰收年，抛撒一点没关系”的思想，要求各地立即把抛撒在地里、路边的夏粮全部拾回来。各地人民公社很快掀起了一个二次小夏收高潮。兴平县组织了三千五百多个拾麦专业组，在地里拾麦。渭南县固市、官道、华阴三个公社的三万六千名辅助劳力，五、六天来每人平均拾麦四十六斤。
    各地在发动二次夏收时，都进行了充分的思想工作。然后按队、按组划片包干，组织检查组，互相进行检查验收，拾不净的麦田，返工重拾。各地公社对社员拾回的麦穗、麦粒，都给予一定的报酬。
