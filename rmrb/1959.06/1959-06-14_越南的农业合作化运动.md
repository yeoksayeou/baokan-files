　　After the August Revolution of 1945, various mutual aid and cooperation organizations with different names had already appeared in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, such as production teams, small farmer groups, labor unions, work exchange groups, and cooperatives. In the early days of the resistance war, the above-mentioned mutual aid and cooperation organizations were further developed, playing a certain role in increasing agricultural production. However, at that time, because land reform had not yet been carried out, the poor and hired peasants had not been fully mobilized, and the mutual aid and cooperation organizations in some places were controlled by middle peasants, and even landlords and rich peasants were absorbed in some places.

　　In 1953, in order to meet the requirements of the resistance war, the Vietnamese Labor Party decided to mobilize the masses to thoroughly implement rent reduction and land reform, and to develop and consolidate mutual aid and cooperation organizations in various places.

　　After the restoration of peace in 1954, the main tasks of Vietnam at that time were to restore the war-damaged economy and carry out land reform in the North; during this period, the development of mutual aid organizations in various places became a mass movement. In March 1955, the Vietnamese Labor Party held a meeting to summarize the rural mutual aid movement; in June of the same year, after the Party Central Committee issued Instruction No. 31, the mutual aid movement flourished throughout the North. At the same time, in 1955, the Party and the government also established six agricultural production cooperatives as pilot projects. By the end of 1956, there were thirty-seven agricultural production cooperatives in the entire North.

　　In May 1957, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party held a meeting to discuss the development of mutual aid organizations. In October of the same year, another meeting was held to preliminarily summarize the construction work of the cooperatives. At the beginning of 1958, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party again approved a plan to consolidate and develop mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and also ran a mutual aid and cooperation training class to train one thousand cooperative cadres at the provincial and county levels, and also instructed various places to run cooperative training classes. In July 1958, the Party Central Committee held another meeting to review the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Since then, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed rapidly. At this time, 41% of farmers in the North had participated in mutual aid teams, and there were a total of one hundred and thirty-four agricultural production cooperatives. On the one hand, the Vietnamese Labor Party resolutely led the masses to improve technology and strive for a bumper harvest; on the other hand, it carried out ideological education on the two roads of capitalism and socialism among the peasant masses. This played a significant role in accelerating the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In April 1959, there were already seven thousand agricultural production cooperatives in North Vietnam (119 of which were advanced cooperatives), accounting for 8% of the total number of peasant households in the North. There were also 246,965 mutual aid teams, accounting for 70% of the total number of peasant households in the North. In addition, there were fifteen state-owned farms and thirty-three military reclamation farms. At present, more than 13,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been established, and the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives has accounted for 16% of the total number of peasant households.

    越南的农业合作化运动
    1945年8月革命后，越南民主共和国各地已经出现一些名称不一的互助合作组织，如生产组、小农团、合工会、变工组和合作社等等。抗战初期，上述的一些互助合作组织获得进一步发展，在增加农业生产方面起了一定的作用。但是，当时因为还没有进行土地改革，贫雇农还没有充分动员起来，一些地方的互助合作组织由中农掌握，有些地方甚至把地主富农都吸收了进去。
    1953年，越南劳动党为了适应抗战的要求，决定发动群众，彻底实现减租和进行土地改革，并发展和巩固各地的合作互助组织。
    1954年和平恢复后，越南当时的主要任务是恢复遭到战争破坏的经济和在北方进行土地改革；这一时期各地发展互助组织已成为群众运动。1955年3月，越南劳动党召开会议，总结了农村互助运动；同年6月，在党中央发出了第三十一号指示以后，互助运动在整个北方蓬勃发展了起来。同时，1955年党和政府还办了六个农业生产合作社，作为试点。1956年底，全北方已有三十七个农业生产合作社。
    1957年5月，越南劳动党中央举行会议，讨论发展互助组织问题。同年10月，又开会初步总结了合作社的建设工作。1958年初，越南劳动党中央又通过巩固、发展互助组和合作社的计划，并且办了一个互助合作训练班，训练一千个省和县级的合作化工作干部，还指示各地开办合作化训练班。1958年7月，党中央又开会检查互助合作运动。从此，互助合作运动迅速发展。这时在北方已有41％的农户参加了互助组，农业生产合作社共有一百三十四个。越南劳动党一方面坚决领导群众改进技术，争取丰收；一方面在农民群众中展开资本主义和社会主义两条道路的思想教育。这对于加速互助合作运动的发展起了很大作用。1959年4月，越南北方已经有七千个农业生产合作社，（其中一百一十九个是高级社）占北方农户总数的8％。另有二十四万六千九百六十五个互助组，占北方农户总数的70％。此外，还有十五个国营农场和三十三个军垦农场。目前，已经建立了一万三千多个农业生产合作社，参加农业生产合作社的农户，已占农户总数的16％。
