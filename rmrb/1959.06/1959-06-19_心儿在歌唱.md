    “心儿在歌唱”
    “周围都是我的朋友，我的前途光明远大……我要永远对着你歌唱，我的祖国！”苏联影片“心儿在歌唱”中的男主角的歌声，是如此优美动人，它在我们耳边盘旋萦绕，使我们久久不能遗忘！这部以歌唱为主的影片，讲述了一对恋人——卡伦和桑娜的悲欢离合的故事，同时通过卡伦的种种遭遇，展示了苏维埃祖国对于人民的无尽的关怀，以及人民对她的热爱。
    双目失明了的卡伦是一个天才的歌唱家，但是流落异国时，他却过着痛苦的生活：小酒店老板剥削他，嫉妒他的人殴打他，他的眼病也因为没有钱不能治疗……回到祖国以后，他的境遇截然不同了：医生用尽一切办法把他的眼睛治好了，他成了音乐学院的学生，成了人民喜爱的歌手！在一次世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节中，他重见了他始终不渝地爱着的桑娜。（方）
