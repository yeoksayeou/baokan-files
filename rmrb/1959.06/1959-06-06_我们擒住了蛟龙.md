"We have subdued the Yellow River, we have captured the dragon, from now on the Yellow River will always be under our control, from now on the Yellow River will bring blessings to the people…." This majestic song from the chorus "Locking the Dragon in the Pool" brought to the audience the heroic spirit of the Yellow River control heroes at the Sanmenxia construction site. This healthy and lively ode, with the theme of conquering the Yellow River, was one of the popular programs in the Beijing Literary and Art Performance. It is divided into four movements. The three songs in the first movement, "Let Me Sing a Song of the Yellow River," "Remembering the Yellow River," and "The Yellow River is Like a Dragon," have a strong Henan folk song flavor. The second and third movements use the form of antiphonal singing and canon to depict the tense days and nights of the Sanmenxia dam construction project. Through music and song, many vivid "heroic images" are established. The last movement, "Ode," is a lyrical female chorus with the flavor of Henan Opera. It depicts the charming scenery on both sides of the Yellow River after the reservoir was built: "See the clear water flowing through the farmland, the crops are good, the fruits are fresh, and the bunches of grapes can't be eaten all... Sanmenxia is the gorge for capturing the dragon, and the reservoir is the pool for locking the dragon. The Yellow River's滔天 waves are no more, only the story of capturing the dragon will be passed down through the ages…."

"Locking the Dragon in the Pool" was collectively created on-site by the poet Xi Yang and composers Li Ni, Zhang Lu, and others.

    “我们擒住了蛟龙”
    “我们制服了黄河，我们擒住了蛟龙，从今后黄河永远归咱们管，从今后黄河造福在人间……。”大合唱“锁龙潭”中这段雄壮的歌声，给听众带来了三门峡工地治黄英雄们气吞山河的豪迈气概。这个以征服黄河为主题的健康活泼的颂歌，是中央歌舞团在北京文艺观摩演出中，受到欢迎的节目之一。它共分四个乐章。第一章中的三支歌“让我唱一唱黄河歌”、“忆黄河”、“黄河好比一条龙”，具有浓郁的河南民歌色彩。第二章和第三章应用对口唱和轮唱的形式，描写了三门峡截流工程中那些紧张的日日夜夜。通过音乐和歌声，树立起很多生动的“英雄形象”。最后一个乐章“颂歌”，是带有河南梆子味道的抒情女声合唱曲。它描绘了水库建成后黄河两岸的迷人景象：“看那清水流过庄稼田，庄稼好，果子鲜，一串串的葡萄吃也吃不完……，三门峡就是擒龙的峡，水库就是锁龙的潭，再不见那黄河浪滔天，只有那擒龙的故事万古传……。”
    “锁龙潭”是诗人希扬和作曲家李尼、张鲁等人在现场集体创作的。
