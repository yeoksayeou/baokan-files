Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 19th. The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article by Borovsky, condemning the policies adopted by Western countries at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.

He wrote: The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has entered its second month, but so far no real results have been achieved. The world public wants to know: Why is the Geneva Conference stalling? Whose fault is it?

The author said: While spreading the smokescreen that the Geneva Conference is in a "crisis" and "stalemate," Western countries are also directing their propagandists to try to make it seem that the position of the Soviet delegation is hindering the progress of the conference because the Soviet Union has adopted "ultimatum" tactics. They call almost every Soviet proposal an "ultimatum."

The commentary pointed out that the facts are completely the opposite. On June 11, taking into account the positions of the United States and other Western countries, the Soviet Union put forward a new proposal: agreeing to the continuation of the occupation regime in West Berlin for one year, and suggesting the establishment of an all-German committee to discuss the issue of German reunification and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. This proposal once again showed the Soviet Union's efforts to make progress at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Soviet Union's new proposal is a necessary basis for approaching each other's attitudes and passing resolutions, but US Secretary of State Herter rejected the Soviet proposal without even studying it, declaring that the Soviet Union's new proposal was another "ultimatum." The article pointed out that it is not difficult to see from these signs that Western countries have long prepared a negative position and do not expect to reach an agreement. Therefore, it is the United States that is hindering the progress of the conference.

The article said, may I ask, did Western countries not know the Soviet Union's position on the Berlin issue when they went to Geneva? What does it mean for the West to demand confirmation of their "right" to occupy West Berlin forever? Western propaganda says that if their demands are not accepted, then no summit meeting will be held. If this is not an ultimatum, then what can be called an ultimatum?

Borovsky then wrote that the idea of holding a summit meeting is the desire of billions of people in all countries around the world, and no one can fail to take this into account. Anyone who wants to resurrect the bankrupt "position of strength" policy, and wants to avoid solving those mature problems that can ease international tensions and consolidate peace, will not succeed.

The article concluded by saying that peace-loving people all over the world are looking forward to progress at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### 西方国家不期望达成协议  外长会议一直在原地踏步  “真理报”载文谴责西方采取的政策

    西方国家不期望达成协议
    外长会议一直在原地踏步
    “真理报”载文谴责西方采取的政策
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联“真理报”刊载了鲍罗夫斯基的一篇文章，谴责西方国家在日内瓦外长会议上采取的政策。
    他写道：日内瓦外长会议已经进入第二个月了，但是至今没有获得真正的结果。世界公众都想知道：为什么日内瓦会议在原地踏步？是谁的过错呢？
    作者说：西方国家在散布日内瓦会议陷入“危机”和“僵局”的烟幕的同时，又指使他们的宣传家们企图把事情说成这样：苏联代表团的立场妨碍了会议取得进展，因为苏联采用了“最后通牒”的手段。他们几乎把苏联的每一个建议都叫做“最后通牒”。
    评论指出事实情况完全相反，6月11日苏联考虑到美国和其他西方国家的立场，提出了新的建议：即同意西柏林的占领制度继续保持一年，并且建议建立全德委员会来讨论有关统一德国和缔结对德和约的问题。这个建议又一次表明苏联力求使外长会议取得进展。苏联的新建议是双方态度接近和通过决议的必要基础，但是美国的赫脱还没有加以研究，就对苏联这个建议横加拒绝，宣称苏联新建议是又一个“最后通牒”。文章指出，从这些迹象中不难看出，西方国家早已准备了否定立场，不期望达成协议。所以阻碍会议进展的正是美国。
    文章说，试问西方国家在前往日内瓦的时候，难道不知道苏联关于柏林问题的立场吗？西方要求确认它们永远占领西柏林的“权利”，这是什么意思呢？西方宣传说，如果不接受它们的要求，那末就不举行最高级会议。如果这不是最后通牒，那末什么才能叫做最后通牒呢？
    鲍罗夫斯基接着写道，举行最高级会议的想法是全世界各国亿万人民的愿望，任何人都不能不考虑到这一点。任何人想把破了产的“实力地位”政策起死回生，想回避解决那些能够缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的业已成熟的问题，都是不能得逞的。
    文章最后说，全世界爱好和平的人民期待着日内瓦外长会议取得进展。
