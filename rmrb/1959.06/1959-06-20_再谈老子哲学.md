    We believe that Lao Tzu's philosophy has materialistic tendencies or elements and contains considerable naive dialectics, but his system is fundamentally idealistic. According to Mr. Feng Youlan, we belong to Party A (Mr. Feng calls those who assert that Lao Tzu's philosophy originated in the Spring and Autumn period and is fundamentally idealistic as Party A, and those who assert that Lao Tzu's philosophy originated in the Warring States period and is fundamentally materialistic as Party B. For the sake of convenience, we also use this designation). On what basis do we determine that Lao Tzu's philosophical system is fundamentally idealistic? Our reasons have already been discussed in the article "On the Idealistic Essence of Lao Tzu's Philosophical System" (published in "Philosophical Research," issue 6). Here, we add some further opinions and raise questions for Party B to consider.
    
    Regarding "The Tao produces one" and "Nothing produces something"
    
    Both Party A and Party B have put forward several reasons to prove their own viewpoints and refute the other side. It is truly, as Mr. Feng said, a difficult and complicated fight. However, in our view, the key to this debate lies in the interpretation of "The Tao produces one" and "Nothing produces something", which is one of the most important keys.
    
    Party A also believes that Lao Tzu's "one" ("one" in "The Tao produces one," also the "one" in Chapter 14's "blended into one") can be interpreted as chaos or primordial Qi; on this point, there is no dispute between Party A and Party B, at least we have no dispute with Party B. However, are Lao Tzu's "Tao" and "one" the same thing? This is where the divergence lies, and it is a fundamental divergence. Party A says: "Tao" is not "one," "one" is produced by "Tao"; and "Tao" belongs to the realm of absolute spirit (Party A has other arguments for Lao Tzu's "Tao" being absolute spirit), so Lao Tzu's philosophy is fundamentally idealistic. In our view, this is a serious "checkmate" for Party B from Party A. Of course, it may not be a "dead check," but it is necessary to break through this "move" of the opponent.
    
    Party B says: Lao Tzu's "Tao" is "one." However, this view has difficult problems to overcome, because Lao Tzu's text clearly states, "The Tao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, and three produces all things"; "All things in the world are born from something, and something is born from nothing." However, so far, Party B has not focused on the chapters in Lao Tzu's book that discuss "The Tao produces one" and "Nothing produces something," so breaking the opponent's "check" is not "seamless."
    
    Party B has seized upon Chapter 21 of Lao Tzu's book: "The Tao, as a thing, is elusive and indistinct; indistinct and elusive, yet within it are images; elusive and indistinct, yet within it are things," saying, "Look, isn't Lao Tzu's 'Tao' materialistic?" This is also a "checkmate" for Party A. As a member of Party A, we believe that this chapter is talking about the process of "The Tao produces one" and "Nothing produces something." The reasons have been discussed in detail in the article "On the Idealistic Essence of Lao Tzu's Philosophical System," and will not be repeated here. Mr. Feng of Party B says that our interpretation is not seamlessly connected with Lao Tzu's text, and there is a suspicion of taking verses out of context and forcing interpretations. But in our view, the opposite is true, and Party B's interpretation has the suspicion of taking verses out of context and forcing interpretations, and is even less seamless. "The Tao, as a thing," taken in isolation, can certainly be interpreted as "Tao, this thing," but when viewed in the context of the surrounding text, it is difficult to explain. Of course, we cannot generally interpret "为" (wei) as "生" (sheng - to produce). Here, we need to read the book with flexibility. Lao Tzu's book says several times, "The Tao always does nothing, yet nothing is left undone"; here, we interpret "为" (wei) in "道之为物" (Tao zhi wei wu) as the "为" (wei) in "道常无为而无不为" (Tao chang wu wei er wu bu wei), and the entire chapter can be understood clearly. This interpretation also does not encounter any difficulties in Lao Tzu's entire book. According to Party B's interpretation, saying that this chapter is entirely about "Tao," and "elusive and indistinct, yet within it are images; elusive and indistinct, yet within it are things" refers to "Tao," then the following problems arise (here, let's not talk about it being inconsistent with Lao Tzu's basic definition of the category of "Tao"): (1) The following text says that "Tao" is "profound and obscure," which means that "Tao" is without form or image (the fact that "Tao" is without form or image is also discussed extensively in other chapters, but there is no place that says "Tao" has form or image), but the previous text says "has images" and "has things"; if the previous text refers to "Tao," then it means that "Tao" has images and forms, and also has no images and forms. How can this be explained? Why are there such contradictions in the same chapter, and in closely connected sentences? If it is said that Lao Tzu's philosophy is inherently contradictory, there is no evidence for it in other chapters. Moreover, if Lao Tzu's philosophy is truly so contradictory, it would be difficult to say that it is fundamentally materialistic; at least the reasons currently held by Party B are not very tenable. (2) According to Party B's interpretation, the following text, "to observe the multitude of beginnings. How do I know the nature of the multitude of beginnings? By this," becomes incomprehensible. "众甫" (zhong fu) is "multitude of fathers," the father of all things, and Lao Tzu's "Tao" is the mother of all things; "以阅众甫" (yi yue zhong fu) is to "observe the multitude of beginnings" with the Tao. Here, if we set aside the explanation of all things in the world (Party A believes that Lao Tzu's all things in the world are the universe, including all things; Party B disagrees), there is no dispute between Party A and Party B, up to now. However, according to Party B's interpretation, "Tao" "has images" and "has things" -- that is to say, it is "众甫" (zhong fu), how can it still "observe the multitude of beginnings" with the Tao? (3) According to Party B's interpretation, the textual structure of this chapter is also illogical. (4) Chapter 14 says that "one" must "return to nothingness." Party A says that "nothingness" here refers to "Tao," which means that "one" must "return to Tao." Does Party B agree with this explanation of Party A? No refutation has been put forward so far. (In our view, it is difficult to have another explanation.) If you agree, then it clearly says "return to nothingness," how can "nothingness" be "things" or "having things"? -- From Lao Tzu's entire book, Party B's explanation has many problems, which will not be listed one by one here. But according to our interpretation, whether from this chapter or from Lao Tzu's entire book, it is consistent. At least, so far, we have not seen Party B raise any unsolvable problems for us.
    
    Even setting aside the various problems that arise from Party B's interpretation of Lao Tzu's Chapter 21, the problem of "The Tao produces one" and "Nothing produces something" has not been resolved. Party A's "check" to Party B makes Party B's solution only possible by choosing one of the following two: (1) prove that "Tao" is "one," and "one" is "Tao," but this must solve the question of how "The Tao produces one" works; (2) or admit that "Tao" and "one" are not the same thing, and prove that "Tao" is also a thing. If this point is proven, then the "Tao" as a thing produces the "one" as a thing, and of course Lao Tzu's philosophy is materialistic. However, when proving that Lao Tzu's "Tao" is a thing, you cannot use Lao Tzu's words about "one" as arguments, because they have not proven that "Tao" is "one." As far as we know, Party B has not focused on (1) so far, but on (2), but when focusing on (2), they cannot abandon "one," but instead use Lao Tzu's words about "one" as materials to prove that "Tao" is a thing. This is illogical and difficult to convince.
    
    For example, one of Mr. Feng Youlan's statements: "Lao Tzu's book says: 'The Tao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, and three produces all things. All things carry Yin and embrace Yang, and blend their Qi to achieve harmony' (Chapter 42). There are three kinds of Qi mentioned here: blended Qi, Yin Qi, and Yang Qi. I think the so-called blended Qi is one, Yin and Yang are two, and three means many in the pre-Qin period. Two produces three means that once there are Yin and Yang, many things are produced. So what kind of Qi is blended Qi?" -- Mr. Feng then quotes the words of "Huainanzi" to argue, which we feel is also not "seamlessly connected" with Lao Tzu's text. However, this does not matter. -- Mr. Feng replied: "Blending is a quality of Tao, 'The Tao is empty, yet in its employment it is inexhaustible' (Chapter 4). This kind of not yet fully differentiated Qi is almost the same as Tao, so it is called blended Qi, and also called one." (Emphasis added by the author)
    
    Here, we raise a few points for Mr. Feng to consider and question.
    
    (1) Saying that "one" is undifferentiated primordial Qi and two is Yin and Yang Qi is acceptable. -- But we think it is far-fetched and cannot agree with interpreting "blend their Qi to achieve harmony" as "blended Qi." However, this is not very important and can be set aside. The key issue is still the issue of "The Tao produces one." Saying that the "produce" in "one produces two, two produces three, and three produces all things" means to produce or differentiate; then what about the "produce" in "The Tao produces one"? Why isn't it to produce or differentiate? Saying that the "one" and "two" and "three" in "one produces two" and "two produces three" are not the same thing, nor are they "almost the same," why does it become that "Tao" and "one" are the same thing or almost the same, and the nature of "one" becomes the nature of "Tao" when it comes to "The Tao produces one"?
    
    "The Tao produces one" is also the problem of "Nothing produces something" (Chapter 40 says, "All things in the world are born from something, and something is born from nothing"), which is a key issue and cannot be glossed over. Saying that "one" and "Tao" are "almost the same," how much do they differ and where? Are "Tao" and "one" the same thing after all? Is "one" produced by "Tao"?
    
    (2) The original text of this chapter is very clear. It says "The Tao produces one," "one produces two," "two produces three," and "three produces all things"; then it says, "All things carry Yin and embrace Yang, and blend their Qi to achieve harmony." This is saying that all things are formed by the blending (harmony) of Yin and Yang Qi, not that "blended Qi" is "Tao." Before Yin and Yang Qi are differentiated, there is primordial Qi, which is "one," which makes sense; but it is clearly produced by "Tao," so how can it be "Tao" or a quality of "Tao"? If it is a quality of "Tao," how important is it in the nature of "Tao"? What is the basic nature of "Tao"? The important thing here is "The Tao produces one," how to explain it? If it cannot be proven that "Tao" = "one," how can Lao Tzu's words about "one" be used to explain Lao Tzu's "Tao"?
    
    (3) Mr. Feng uses Chapter 4's "The Tao is empty, yet in its employment it is inexhaustible" to prove that the "empty" of the so-called "blended Qi" is a quality of "Tao." This may be difficult. In Chapter 4, "The Tao is empty, yet in its employment it is inexhaustible," commentators have traditionally interpreted "empty" as "zhong (盅)." "Shuowen Jiezi" (说文): "Zhong (盅), a vessel is empty." "The Tao is empty, yet in its employment it is inexhaustible," "empty" is in contrast to "full," meaning that the Tao is "always empty" (i.e., nothing), it plays a role everywhere, but it will not become "full" (i.e., "solid"). The "blend their Qi to achieve harmony" in Chapter 40 is difficult to read as "zhong (盅)." Shuowen Jiezi: "Chong (冲), surging and shaking." "Zhong (盅)" and "chong (冲)" have different meanings. To describe the emptiness of the Tao, "zhong (盅)" is used; to describe the surging and shaking of Yin and Yang Qi to achieve harmony and transform into all things, "chong (冲)" is used. The "chong (冲)" in "blend their Qi to achieve harmony" here, according to the Shuowen Jiezi's explanation of the original meaning of "chong (冲)," is fully consistent with the context. But interpreting it as "blended Qi" makes it impossible to understand the text. "Blend their Qi to achieve harmony" comes right after "All things carry Yin and embrace Yang," clearly saying that Yin and Yang Qi harmonize and combine with each other to transform and generate all things. Mr. Feng interprets this as "blended Qi," using Wang Anshi's interpretation. Wang Anshi was a materialist, and his scholarship and achievements as a historical figure are extremely commendable. But he was not very proficient in analyzing and explaining words, often resorting to far-fetched interpretations. His interpretation of Lao Tzu may not conform to Lao Tzu's original meaning. For example, Peng Si's "Collected Annotations of the True Scripture of Morality" Chapter 40 quotes Wang Anshi's "Explanation of Characters" saying, "Blended Qi takes Tianyi as the main thing, so it follows water, and it is in the middle of heaven and earth, so it is from the middle." This is similar to Su Shi's ridiculed explanation of "wave" as "the skin of water."
    
    In addition, Party A has raised several difficult problems for Party B; if Party B wants to argue that Lao Tzu's philosophy is materialistic, it should solve those problems one by one.
    
    Regarding Lao Tzu's "View of the Tao of Heaven"
    
    Recently, Party B has also given Party A a rather serious "check," which is the issue of Lao Tzu's "view of the Tao of Heaven."
    
    Party B says: Lao Tzu denied a heaven with will, a personal god, and God. In the Spring and Autumn period, the view of the Tao of Heaven was the basic issue in the debate between materialism and idealism, so Lao Tzu's philosophy is fundamentally materialistic. If Party A believes that Lao Tzu's philosophical system originated in the mid-Warring States period, this question is easy to answer. Because in the mid-Warring States period, the concept of a heaven with will and a personal god had already collapsed, and it could no longer serve the ruling class (there is not much disagreement on this point between Party A and Party B); so Lao Tzu replaced God with absolute spirit and sophisticated idealism. However, many people in Party A are determined to "create difficulties" for themselves, insisting that Lao Tzu's philosophical system originated in the Spring and Autumn period. We are like that. In this way, Party B's reasons regarding Lao Tzu's view of the Tao of Heaven have become a rather serious "check" for Party A.
    
    How to break through this "check"? Party A cannot avoid this question. In the article "On the Idealistic Essence of Lao Tzu's Philosophical System," we tried to answer this question. The main reasons are: (1) Lao Tzu's "view of the Tao of Heaven" should be taken seriously, but it cannot be separated from the basic issues of philosophy and isolated. Idealism and theism cannot be equated under any circumstances. Idealism can replace God with absolute spirit. As long as Lao Tzu's philosophy acknowledges that consciousness is primary, then it is fundamentally idealistic. (2) In the mid-Spring and Autumn period, the era in which Lao Tzu lived, a heaven with will and a personal god had already collapsed in practice, so Lao Tzu's idealistic philosophical system appeared to meet the requirements of the times. Here, we will not repeat the arguments in that article; we will only add a little to the second point.
    
    In the Yin and early Zhou dynasties, in people's minds, the power of God was unparalleled, and he was all-wise and all-powerful; everything had to be asked of heaven, and the commands of heaven were conveyed through divination using tortoise shells. At that time, no one complained about heaven. The Zhou family took the place of the Yin, saying that "the Tao of Heaven has no favorites, it always sides with the good." But from King Li and King You to the early Spring and Autumn period, a major change took place in people's concepts. At this time, people complained about heaven, hated heaven, and cursed heaven, including several rulers (this is a reflection of social turmoil in people's minds at that time, which will not be discussed in detail here). They cursed heaven for being confused,昏庸, abnormal, evil, and not opening its eyes, simply becoming a bad guy. There are many records of this in the "Book of Songs." Here are a few excerpts. For the convenience of some readers, we quote the translation from the "Selected Translations of Elegies and Odes" published by Classical Literature Publishing House. For example, "Great Elegies," "Dang Chapter" (according to records, this was written by Duke Zhao Mu to satirize King Li):
    
    "Ruined, ruined, God! Ruler of the people below!
    God who eats people and kills people! How can his qualities be so depraved?" Again, such as "Small Elegies," "Xiao Min Chapter" (according to records, this was written by a doctor to satirize King You):
    
    "Alas, the cruel heaven! Its violence is spread over the land below. ... Our divining tortoise shells are tired of divining,
    They no longer tell us the auspiciousness or ominousness of policies." Again, such as "Small Elegies," "Rain Without Justice" (according to records, this was written by a close attendant to satirize King You's昏暴):
    
    "Vast and expansive Hao Heaven, does not always protect his kindness.
    Sends down death and famine, killing the countries in all directions. Hao Heaven
    Ah, too cruel! Does not think or measure." There is no need to quote more, there are many poems in the "Book of Songs" complaining about heaven, hating heaven, and cursing heaven. Of course, this is not a direct denial of gods; but this change in the concept of the Tao of Heaven is very significant, and we cannot underestimate it. Guo Moruo, in the play "Cai Wenji," borrowed the mouth of Cao Cao to say that Cai Wenji's "Eighteen Songs of the Nomad Flute," which complained about heaven and hated heaven, "contained the view of灭神论." This is reasonable. Then, wouldn't the words of complaining about heaven, hating heaven, and cursing heaven so fiercely recorded in the "Book of Songs" also "contain the view of灭神论"? -- At least there is the芽苗 of灭神论. There is nothing strange in saying that. Because the concept of faith in the Tao of Heaven regards God as an all-knowing and all-powerful absolute authority; and people complain about heaven, hate heaven, and curse heaven, which means that God has already shaken in people's minds, and he is no longer all-knowing and all-powerful. Logically speaking, God as an absolute authority has been destroyed. This is the芽苗 of atheism, a transitional stage from regarding God as an all-knowing and all-powerful absolute authority to denying the existence of God. People complain about heaven, hate heaven, and curse heaven in that way, which means that the concept of God has begun to disintegrate in people's minds, and people no longer trust it. Of course, under certain historical conditions, the prestige of the Heavenly Emperor can still be restored by the rulers; but in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period, this was impossible, and it turned sharply downward from resentment to suspicion to denial of heaven.
    
    Since the Spring and Autumn period, the struggle between the two major camps surrounding the view of the Tao of Heaven in philosophy, the form of the struggle, and its connection with political struggle and economic foundation, still need to be well studied. Below, we will only raise some opinions on the issue of theism and atheism.
    
    Most of the "Jingyan" in the existing "Guanzi" book may be Guan Zhong's political arguments, political orders, and strategies that were preserved as Qi state archives. Among them, there is quite a clear materialistic thought and atheistic thought (this needs a special article to discuss, which will not be discussed here for the time being). According to the records of Zuozhuan and Guoyu, there are quite a few materials on灭神论 and atheism. Here, let's just talk about Zheng Zichan. Zichan was a rather thorough atheist. For example, Zheng Daifu Bi Zao said to Zichan: Song, Wei, Chen, and Zheng will have fires on the same day; Zichan should quickly use treasures to pray to avoid disaster. Zichan did not listen to this. After several days, Song, Wei, Chen, and Zheng really had fires. Bi Zao said to Zichan again: Not listening to my words (to pray), Zheng will have a fire again. Zi Dashu also criticized Zichan, saying, "Treasures are used to protect the people. If there is a big fire, the country will perish. Why do you love treasures so much and refuse to sacrifice?" Zichan still did not listen. He said: Bi Zao knows the Tao of Heaven, but he is talking nonsense. Saying too much, he accidentally happened to be right. And he concluded with such a principle: "The Tao of Heaven is far, and the Tao of Man is near, and it is beyond our reach." "Beyond our reach" means that the Tao of Heaven and human affairs are not related. In his view, "the Tao of Heaven" is certainly not a God or personal god who manages the human world. ("Zuozhuan" Zhao Gong seventeenth year, eighteenth year). Also: There was a flood in Zheng, and dragons fought in Youyuan. According to the concepts of the early Zhou Dynasty, dragons were divine creatures. The people asked Zichan to quickly perform exorcism sacrifices. Zichan did not listen to this, he said: When people fight, dragons do not come to greet them with courtesy; when dragons fight, why should we greet them with courtesy? Youyuan is the dragon's residence, performing exorcism sacrifices, asking them to go there. I have no demands on the dragon, and the dragon has no demands on me. (Zuozhuan Zhao Gong nineteenth year) Look, isn't Zichan an atheist? Zichan was the执政 of Zheng! According to the materials recorded in "Zuozhuan," it seems that Zichan sometimes believed in gods; but upon closer examination, this was not the case. It was often a response to special occasions, such as diplomatic rhetoric. For example, once Zichan went to Jin, and Jin minister Shu Xiang asked Zichan about the illness of the Marquis of Jin. Shu Xiang said: Our ruler is ill, and the diviners say that it is caused by Shi Shen and Tai Tai, and the historians do not know what gods they are. I ask you for advice. This was in a diplomatic setting, and Zichan was known for his erudition, so he first replied that Shi Shen and Tai Tai were the gods, the descendants of an ancestor in ancient times; but he then said, "These two do not reach your body," "If it is your body, then it is also a matter of entering and exiting, eating and drinking, sadness and joy." To be healthy, you must pay attention to diet, and do not overdo sadness and joy, and "If this heart is not happy, and the hundreds of degrees are昏乱 ... then disease will surely arise." (Zhao Gong first year) Isn't this atheism? In our view, Zichan represents the progressive trend of the lower aristocracy and slave owners beginning to transform into landlords. His compiling of fields and acres, "making hill taxes," and "casting criminal tripods" (promulgating written laws) were all progressive measures. "Making hill taxes" is to recognize private land ownership and tax private fields uniformly, which is similar to the "first tax acres" in the state of Lu (Guo Moruo made a good analysis of Lu's "first tax acres," which is to recognize private land ownership and tax private fields uniformly, see "Ten Criticisms," page 47). He was opposed by many great aristocrats. When he first accepted Zi Pi's授政, his greatest concern was that Zheng had "large clans and many靇". Zi Pi supported him, saying "If Hu (Zi Pi's name) leads and listens, who dares to offend you?" He then took office. But after taking office, the clan Feng Juan seized a small excuse (actually because Zichan compiled fields and acres, and made hill taxes), gathered his subordinates and prepared to kill Zichan. Zichan had no choice but to flee to the state of Jin. The veteran Zi Pi supported him again, and he was spared. When Zichan first took office, he had to compromise with the great clans, but later he was not polite to them, such as exiling Zi Nan and killing Zi Xi. Zichan's casting of criminal books was opposed by Shu Xiang, an aristocrat of Jin, who wrote a letter to Zichan on this matter. Looking at this letter can help us understand the struggle between the two major camps at that time. The letter is as follows:
        "I originally had expectations of you, but now it is over! In the past, the former kings
    Deliberated on matters to make laws, not criminal laws, fearing that the people would have contentious hearts. Even so, they could not be prohibited or controlled. Therefore, they regulated them with righteousness, corrected them with politics, practiced them with etiquette, guarded them with faith, served them with benevolence, established ranks and positions to encourage their obedience, and severely punished their lasciviousness. Fearing that it was not enough, they taught them with loyalty, inspired them with action, taught them with affairs, made them harmonious, treated them with respect, ruled them with strength, and judged them with rigidity. They still sought the sages and wise men above, the officials who were discerning, the leaders who were loyal and trustworthy, and the teachers who were benevolent and kind. The people were then able to be used and did not cause disasters. If the people know that there are laws, they will not be afraid of their superiors, and they will all have contentious hearts to seek in the books, and they will be lucky to succeed. This is not possible. Xia had乱政 and made 'Yu Criminal Law', Shang had乱政 and made 'Tang Criminal Law', Zhou had乱政 and made 'Nine Criminal Laws' -- the rise of the three criminal laws was all in the declining years. Now you are minister of Zheng, making boundaries and ditches, establishing slanderous policies, making three criminal laws, casting criminal books, and trying to pacify the people. Isn't it difficult? The poem says: 'Emulate and embody King Wen's virtue, pacify the four directions every day', and also says, 'Emulate King Wen, and all countries will trust him.' The people know the causes of disputes, and will abandon etiquette and seek in the books. Even the smallest matters of锥刀 will be disputed, and chaotic prisons will abound, bribery will run rampant, and in your lifetime, Zheng will be defeated! Xi has heard that 'When a country is about to perish, it will make many laws.'
    Isn't this what it means!" Look, isn't what this letter emphasizes consistent with Lao Tzu's political thought, as if it came from the same nostril? From this, at least we can get some inspiration in determining the class nature of Lao Tzu's philosophy!
    
    Getting far away from the topic, let's pull it back. Zichan was about the same time as Lao Tzu. As mentioned above, Zichan was an atheist in his view of the Tao of Heaven (at that time, it was not just Zichan, such as Fan Li, who was quite thorough in this respect). This was a progressive trend of thought at that time, and it was not accidental. It was a reflection of economic changes and class struggle in the form of ideas, which developed from the thoughts of resentment, hatred, and curses of heaven in the late Western Zhou Dynasty. As for those who doubted heaven at that time, there were even more. For example, Confucius, who was relatively conservative and advocated Zongzhou and亲亲, also expressed doubt about heaven. In this situation, as a thinker of a declining aristocracy - Lao Tzu, creating an idealistic system and placing the absolute spirit of "Tao" before God, what is so strange? Moreover, Lao Tzu did not completely deny personal gods. On the one hand, he said, "Heaven and earth are not benevolent," and on the other hand, he said, "The Tao of Heaven has no favorites, and always sides with the good." This is much worse than the atheism of Zichan and others.
    
    From what has been said above, Lao Tzu's so-called "view of the Tao of Heaven" cannot become a strong basis for him to be a materialist; if Lao Tzu's philosophical system is placed in the Warring States period, then it will be even less so.
  Regarding the modernization of Lao Tzu and others
    
    Mr. Feng said that both Party A and Party B have modernized Lao Tzu, and it is said that both sides have too high demands on ancient materialism. We think not. So far, neither side has shown a tendency to modernize Lao Tzu.
    
    What is the modernization of Lao Tzu? We think it refers to these situations: (1) It is to forcibly hang modern people's thoughts under the name of the ancients, such as forcibly hanging modern materialistic or idealistic thoughts under the name of Lao Tzu. However, Party B, which now believes that Lao Tzu is a materialist, has not described him as an eighteenth-century materialist, and Party A, which believes that Lao Tzu is fundamentally an idealist, has not described him as Hegel. Mr. Feng said that Party A has Hegelized Lao Tzu. We think not. According to Party A's interpretation, Lao Tzu has not become Hegel either. If it is said to be similar, it is correct; but in Party A's view, Lao Tzu's philosophy is fundamentally "objective" idealism, so how can it not be similar to Hegel's philosophy? This is the same as saying that Lao Tzu is a materialist, and the interpretation of Lao Tzu cannot but be similar to the old materialism thousands of years after Lao Tzu. There is nothing strange about this. It is impossible to argue anything from here. Even if one side really modernizes Lao Tzu, it needs to be specifically demonstrated. We believe that Party B has not yet presented concrete arguments that someone in Party A has Hegelized Lao Tzu. (2) Imposing the entire connotation of modern noun concepts on the ancients. For example, regarding the concept of the specific form of matter, the ancients and modern people have great differences, and it cannot be required that the ancient people's concept of material elements must be equal to modern concepts such as atoms and electrons. But it cannot be concluded that the ancients did not have the concept of "matter" at all. The same is true for the concept of space-time, etc.
    
    For example, this one: Mr. Feng said that the heaven and earth and all things mentioned by Lao Tzu are not equal to nature and the universe mentioned today. Concepts such as "nature" and "universe" are difficult to have in pre-Qin philosophy. It is said that Lao Tzu has no concept of space-time, and that Lao Tzu's "Tao" is超时间绝对云云, is to impose some modern concepts on Lao Tzu. Is this really the case? We think not.
    
    First, how could there be no concept of "nature" and "universe" in pre-Qin philosophy? The four directions above and below are called Yu (宇), and time is called "Jiu (久)" (the ancient character "Jiu" is "宙"). Doesn't the "Mo Jing" clearly talk about the universe? The pre-Qin people said the six directions above and below, and Zhuangzi said "traveling outside the six directions above and below", isn't this the concept of space-time? Again, "Guanzi" "Zhouhe Chapter" (no one thinks it is not a pre-Qin work) says: "Heaven and earth are the橐 of all things, and Zhouhe also has橐 heaven and earth. Heaven and earth苴(wrap) all things, so it is said that all things are the橐; The meaning of Zhouhe, goes up to the top of heaven, down to the bottom of the earth, goes out beyond the four seas, combines and connects heaven and earth, ... It is so big that there is nothing outside, and so small that there is nothing inside, so it is said that there is also槖 heaven and earth." Isn't this the concept of space-time and the concept of the universe? Xunzi criticized Zhuangzi for "being blinded by heaven and not knowing people," isn't this the concept of "nature"?

    Second, speaking of Lao Tzu, he said "Heaven is long and earth is久", and "Those who do not lose their place are 久", and "Heaven and earth cannot last 久", isn't this the concept of time? Saying that "Tao" is in principle无形 and常虚, doesn't this mean that it does not occupy space? From the logic of thinking: Although the ancients may not have had such a clear concept of space-time as people today, according to his knowledge at the time, when discussing the object he was discussing, he could not but actually involve the relationship between that object and space-time in a specific way. Lao Tzu is an example. This point has been answered in more detail in the article "On the Idealistic Essence of Lao Tzu's Philosophical System," and will not be repeated here.
    
    Third, whether the "heaven and earth" and "天下" mentioned by Lao Tzu refer to the universe and all things can be discussed. Could it refer to the blue sky above the head and the earth under the feet? In that case, "Tao" producing heaven and earth would not necessarily fall into idealism, because "Tao" could still be the混沌 before heaven and earth were separated. But Lao Tzu said "All things in the world are born from something, and something is born from nothing," doesn't "something" include everything material before heaven and earth were separated, such as "混沌"? Lao Tzu also said: "The Tao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, and three produces all things", Mr. Feng also said that "one" is "元气", "two" is Yin and Yang 二气; then since it is 元气, it is the initial material existence, but it is produced by "Tao". Therefore, we say that in Lao Tzu's mind, "Tao" produces the universe and all things - or produces all things, where does this modernize Lao Tzu?
    
    In fact, there is also no issue of whether the demands on Lao Tzu's materialism are too high. Neither Party A nor Party B has such a principle: if it is not pure materialism, it is not materialism, or if it is not pure idealism, it is not idealism. Both sides are basically specifically analyzing how much materialism or idealism is contained. Mr. Feng raised this opinion, which is good as a way to prevent the modernization of Lao Tzu. Party A should not say that Lao Tzu has no materialism at all because Party B insists that Lao Tzu is a materialist; Party B should not say that Lao Tzu is pure materialism because Party

    再谈老子哲学
    关锋  林聿时
    我们认为老子哲学具有唯物主义的倾向或因素，并有相当丰富的朴素辩证法，但他的体系却基本上是唯心主义的。照冯友兰先生的说法，我们是属于甲方的（冯先生把断定老子哲学产生于春秋时代、断定老子哲学基本上是唯心主义的称为甲方，把断定老子哲学产生于战国、断定老子哲学基本上是唯物主义的称为乙方。为了说明上的方便，我们也沿用这个说法）。根据什么断定老子哲学体系基本上是唯心主义的？我们的理由，在“论老子哲学体系的唯心主义本质”一文（载“哲学研究”第六期）里已经谈过了。这里再补充一点意见，并向乙方质疑和请教。
    关于“道生一”、“无生有”
    甲乙双方，各提出了若干理由证明自己的观点，驳诘对方。真是如冯先生所说，杀得难解难分。但是，依我们看来，这场争论却有关键所在；关于“道生一”、“无生有”，便是一个最重要的关键。
    甲方也认为，对老子的“一”（“道生一”的“一”，亦即十四章的“混而为一”的“一”），可以解释为混沌或者元气；在这一点上，甲乙双方是没有争论的，至少我们是和乙方没有争论的。但是，老子的“道”和“一”是一个东西吗？这就有分歧了，而且这是一个根本的分歧。甲方说：“道”不是“一”，“一”是“道”生出来的；而“道”属于绝对精神之类（甲方对老子的“道”是绝对精神还另有论证），所以说老子哲学基本上是唯心主义。依我们看，这是甲方对乙方严重的“将了一军”。当然未必是“死棋”，但却必须破开对方这“一步棋”。
    乙方说：老子的“道”就是“一”。不过，这种说法却有难以克服的困难，因为老子本文明明的说“道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物”；“天下万物生于有，有生于无”。可是，到目前为止，乙方并没有在老子书讲“道生一”、“无生有”的两章上作文章，所以破对方的“将军”，并不“丝丝入扣”。
    乙方抓住了老子书的二十一章：“道之为物，惟恍惟惚，惚兮恍兮，其中有象，恍兮惚兮，其中有物”，说，你看老子的“道”不是物质性的吗？这也是对甲方“将了一军”。作为甲方的一员，我们认为这一章是讲的“道生一”、“无生有”的过程，理由已在“论老子哲学体系的唯心主义本质”一文里详细谈过，这里不再重复。乙方的冯先生说，我们的解释和老子本文并不丝丝入扣，有断章取义、牵强附会之嫌。但在我们看来却相反，认为乙方的解释有断章取义、牵强附会之嫌，更不丝丝入扣。“道之为物”，孤立地看，固然可以解作“道这个东西”，但和上下文联系起来看，却难以讲通。固然，我们不能一般的把“为”训为“生”。这里需要死书活读。老子书几次说“道常无为而无不为”；这里把“道之为物”的“为”，解作“道常无为而无不为”的“为”，全章可以豁然贯通，这样解释在老子全书中也遇不到什么困难。按乙方的解释，说这一章全是说的“道”，“惚兮恍兮，其中有象，恍兮惚兮，其中有物”就是指的“道”，就发生了以下几个问题（这里且不说和老子对于“道”这个范畴的基本规定不符）：（1）下文说“道”“窈兮冥兮”，就是说“道”无形、无象（“道”无形、无象，在其他各章也讲得不少，却没有说“道”有形、有象的地方），可是上文却说“有象”，“有物”；如果上文是指的“道”，那末就是“道”有象、有形，又无象、无形，这怎么解释？在同一章里，而且是紧紧相接的文句，为什么自相矛盾如此？如果说老子哲学就是这样自相矛盾的，却在其他各章找不出任何证据。而且，如果老子哲学真的是这样自相矛盾，也就很难说它基本上是唯物主义的了；起码现在乙方所持的理由不大能成立。（2）按乙方的解释，紧接着的下文“以阅众甫。吾何以知众甫之然哉？以此。”就成了不可理解的了。“众甫”即是“众父”、万物之父，老子的“道”则是天下万物之母；“以阅众甫”就是以道“阅众甫”。这里，如果抛开对天下万物的解释不谈（甲方认为老子说的天下万物就是宇宙万物、包括所有的物；乙方不同意），甲乙双方，到现在为止是没有争论的。可是，按照乙方的解释，“道”就“有象”、“有物”了——也就是说它就是“众甫”，怎么还能以道“阅众甫”呢？（3）按照乙方的解释，在这一章的文字结构上也说不通。（4）十四章说“一”要“复归于无物”，甲方说，这里“无物”是指的“道”，这是说的“一”要“复归于道”。对甲方的这种解释，乙方是否同意呢？到现在为止还没有提出反驳。（依我们看是难以有另外解释的。）如果同意的话，那末，明明说“复归于无物”，怎么“无物”又是“物”、又是“有物”呢？——从老子全书说，乙方的解释，问题还很多，这里不一一列举。而按我们的解释，从本章说或从老子全书说，却是说得通的。至少，到目前为止，我们还没有看到乙方给我们提出不可解决的问题。
    就是抛开乙方解释老子二十一章发生的种种问题，也还没有解决“道生一”、“无生有”的问题。甲方对乙方的这个“将军”，使得乙方的破法只能是从下面二者当中择其一：（1）证明“道”就是“一”，“一”就是“道”，可是这必须解决“道生一”是怎么回事；（2）或者承认“道”和“一”不是一个东西，而证明“道”也是物，如果证明了这一点，那就是作为物的“道”产生作为物的“一”，当然老子哲学是唯物主义的了。可是，在证明老子的“道”是物的时候，却不能把老子讲“一”的话拉来作为论据，因为他们并没有证明“道”就是“一”。据我们了解，到目前为止，乙方并没有从（1）作文章，而是从（2）作文章，但是从（2）作文章的时候却又舍不开“一”，而是把老子讲“一”的话拉来作为证明“道”是物的材料。这不合乎逻辑，难以令人信服。
    例如冯友兰先生的一种说法：“老子书说：‘道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物，万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和’（四十二章）这里说的有三种气：冲气、阴气、阳气。我认为所谓冲气就是一，阴阳是二，三在先秦是多数的意思，二生三就是说，有了阴阳，很多的东西就生出来了。那么冲气究竟是那一种气呢？”——冯先生接着引了“淮南子”的话来论证，我们觉得这和老子本文也不是“丝丝入扣”的。不过，这可不论。——冯先生答复说：“冲是道的一种性质，‘道冲而用之或不盈’（四章）。这种尚未完全分化的气，与道还差不多，所以叫冲气，也叫作一。”（着重点是引者加的）
    这里，我们提出几点意见，向冯先生请教和质疑。
      （一）说“一”是未分化的元气，二是阴阳二气，这是可以的。——但把“冲气以为和”解作“冲气”，我们以为牵强，不能同意。不过，这不太重要，可以置而不论。问题的关键，还是“道生一”的问题。说“一生二，二生三，三生万物”的“生”，是产生或分化的意思；那末“道生一”的“生”呢？为什么就不是产生或分化呢？说“一生二”、“二生三”其中的“一”和“二”和“三”并不是一个东西，也不是“差不多”，为什么一到“道生一”就变成“道”和“一”是一个东西，或差不多，“一”的性质就变成“道”的性质呢？
  “道生一”也就是“无生有”（四十章说“天下万物生于有，有生于无”）的问题，是一个关键问题，不能含混过去。说“一”和“道”还“差不多”，到底差多少、差在哪里？究竟“道”和“一”是不是一个东西？“一”是不是“道”所产生的？
      （二）这一章的原文很明白，它说由“道生一”、“一生二”、“二生三”、“三生万物”；然后又说“万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和”。这是说的万物是由阴阳二气化合（和）而成，并不是说“冲气”就是“道”。在阴阳二气分化之前有元气，它就是“一”，这是说得通的；但是，它明明是“道”之所生，怎么它又是“道”或
  “道”的一种性质呢？如是“道”的一种性质，在“道”的性质中占多大地位？“道”的基本性质是什么？这里重要的是“道生一”，怎么解释？如果不能证明“道”＝“一”，怎么又能拿老子讲“一”的话，解释老子的“道”？
      （三）冯先生以第四章的“道冲而用之或不盈”来证明所谓“冲气”的“冲”是“道”的一种性质。这恐怕很困难。第四章“道冲而用之或不盈”，历来注老者训“冲”为“盅”。“说文”：“盅，器虚也”。“道冲而用之或不盈”，“冲”对“盈”而言，即说道是“常虚”（也即是无），它到处起作用，但不会变成“盈”（也即是“实”）。四十章的“冲气以为和”，读作“盅”却是困难的。说文：“冲，涌摇也”。“盅”、“冲”二义不同，喻道之虚故用“盅”；说阴阳二气涌摇为和，化生万物，故用“冲”。这里的“冲气以为和”之“冲”，按“说文”对“冲”本字的解释，是完全符合上下文的。而解释为“冲气”却上下不透气。“冲气以为和”是紧接着
  “万物负阴而抱阳”来的，显然是说阴阳二气，互相调和、结合，化生万物。冯先生把这解作
  “冲气”，用了王安石的解释。王安石是唯物主义者，其学问事功，作为一个历史上的人物，是极可称赞的。但他对解字训诂却不太内行，往往牵强附会。他对老子的解释未必符合老子的本意。例如彭耜的“道德真经集注”第四十章，引王安石“字说”曰：“冲气以天一为主，故从水，天地之中也故从中。”这如同被苏轼讥笑过的解“波”为“水之皮”差不多。
    此外，甲方还给乙方提出若干难题；乙方要论证老子哲学是唯物主义，对于那些问题应该一一解决。
    关于老子的“天道观”
    最近乙方也给了甲方一个相当严重的“将军”，这就是老子的“天道观”问题。
    乙方说：老子否认有意志的天、人格神、上帝，在春秋时代天道观是唯物主义和唯心主义争论的基本问题，所以老子哲学基本上是唯物主义的。如果甲方认为老子哲学体系产生于战国中期，这个问题很好答复。因为在战国中期，有意志的天、人格神观念已经坍台了，它不能为统治阶级服务了（这在甲乙双方没有多大分歧）；所以老子以绝对精神、精致的唯心主义代替上帝。但是，甲方有不少的人，却硬是要给自己“制造困难”，偏认为老子哲学体系产生于春秋。我们就是这样的。这样，乙方的关于老子天道观的理由，就成了对甲方的相当严重的“将军”。
    怎么破开这个“将军”？甲方不能回避这个问题。在“论老子哲学体系的唯心主义本质”一文里，我们曾试着解答这个问题，其主要理由有二：（1）对老子的“天道观”是应该重视的，但不能脱离开哲学的基本问题，把它孤立起来。不能在任何条件下，把唯心主义和有神论划等号，唯心主义可以用绝对精神代替上帝。只要老子哲学承认意识是第一性的，那么它就基本上是唯心主义。（2）春秋中叶即老子所处的时代，有意志的天、人格神，在实践上已经基本上垮了，所以适应时势的要求出现了老子的唯心主义哲学体系。这里我们不再重复那篇文章中所说的论据；只对第二点再作一点补充。
    在殷代和周初，在人们的观念中，上帝的威力是无比的、它是全智全能的；一切事情要问问天，靠龟卜传达天的命令。那时没有怨天的。周家取殷而代之，说是“天道无亲，常与善人”。但从厉王、幽王到春秋初年，人们的观念却发生了一个重大变化。这时人们怨天、恨天、骂天了，并且包括若干统治者在内（这是当时社会变乱在人们头脑中的反映，这里不详说）。他们骂天糊涂、昏庸、反常、恶邪，不睁眼睛，简直成了坏蛋。这在“诗经”中有许多记载。这里抄录几则。为了某些读者阅读方便，我们引用古典文学出版社出版的“雅颂选译”的译文。如“大雅”、“荡篇”（据记载这是召穆公刺厉王所作）：
    “坏了，坏了，上帝！下民的君呢！
    吃人杀人的上帝！他的品质怎多邪辟？”再如“小雅”的“小旻篇”（据记载是大夫刺幽王所作）：
    “可怜的天呀，暴虐！遍施在下面的国土。…………我们占卜的龟灵已经厌倦，
    不再告诉我们政策的吉凶。”又如“小雅”的“雨无正”（据记载是侍御近臣刺幽王昏暴所作）：
    “浩浩广大的昊天，不常保他的恩德。
    降下死亡饥荒，杀害四方诸国。昊天
    呀太暴虐！不思虑也不量度”。不必多引了，“诗经”上怨天、恨天、骂天的诗很多。固然，这还不是直接否定神的；但这个天道观念上的变化是很大的，我们不能轻视。郭沫若在“蔡文姬”剧本中，借曹操的嘴说，蔡文姬怨天、恨天的“胡笳十八拍”，“包含着灭神论的见解”。这是有道理的。那末，“诗经”所载那么厉害的怨天、恨天、骂天的话，岂不是也“包含着灭神论见解”？——至少有灭神论的萌芽。这样说是没有什么奇怪的。因为天道迷信的观念是把上帝看作全知全能的绝对权威；而人们怨天、恨天、骂天，就表示上帝在人们的观念中已经动摇，它已经不是全知全能的了，从逻辑上说，上帝作为绝对的权威已经破坏了。这是无神论的萌芽，是由把上帝看成全知全能的绝对权威到否定上帝之存在的一个过渡阶段。人们那样怨天、恨天、骂天，就表示上帝观念在人们心目中已经开始瓦解，人们对它不信任了。当然，在一定的历史条件下，天帝的威信还可以被统治者恢复起来；但在春秋战国时代这却是办不到的了，而是从对天的怨恨到怀疑、到否定，而急转直下了。
    由春秋以来，在哲学上围绕着天道观所进行的两大阵营的斗争，其斗争形势，及其和政治斗争、经济基础的联系，还需要作很好的研究。下面我们仅就有神论和无神论的问题，提出一些意见。
    现存“管子”书的“经言”大部分可能是管仲的政论、政令、方策被当作齐国的档案保存下来的。这其中就有相当鲜明的唯物主义思想和无神论思想（这需要专文来论证，这里暂且不谈）。据左传、国语记载，很有些灭神论、无神论的材料。这里只说一说郑子产。子产是一个相当彻底的无神论者。例如，郑大夫裨灶对子产说：宋、卫、陈、郑将在同日发生火灾；要子产赶快用宝物祈祷，以求免灾。子产不听这一套。过了若干天，宋、卫、陈、郑却真发生了火灾。裨灶又对子产说：不听我的话（去祈祷），郑又要发生火灾。子大叔也批评子产说：“宝是用来保民的，若有大火，国家就会亡，你为什么那么爱宝，不肯祭祀呢？”子产还是不听。他说：裨灶那里知道天道，不过乱说一通，说多了，偶然碰上了罢了。并且，他归结为这样一个原则：“天道远，人道迩，非所及也。”“非所及也”，就是说，天道和人事是不相干的。这在他的观念里，“天道”当然不是什么管人间的上帝、人格神了。（“左传”昭公十七年、十八年）。还有：郑国大水，有龙斗于洧渊。按周初观念，龙是神物。国人就请子产赶快禳祭。子产不听这一套，他说：人斗，龙并不来以礼相见；龙斗，我们为什么要去和他以礼相见呢？洧渊就是龙的住宅，禳祭，叫它到那里去。我无求于龙，龙也无求于我。（左传昭公十九年）你看，子产不是无神论者吗？子产是郑国的执政啊！据“左传”所记材料，似乎子产有时又信神；细审之并不然，那常常是在特殊场合的应付，如外交辞令。例如，有一次子产到晋国去，晋国的大臣叔向向子产问晋侯之疾。叔向说：寡君生病，卜人说是实沈、台骀作祟，史官不知道是什么神，我向你请教。这是在外交场合，子产又是以博学见称的，所以他先答复实沈、台骀是什么神，是上古那一位祖先的后人；但他却接着说，“此二者，不及君身”，
  “若君身，则亦出入饮食哀乐之事也”。要身体健康必须注意饮食，不要过度哀乐，而“兹心不爽，而昏乱百度……则必生疾矣。”（昭公元年）这不是无神论吗？以我们看来，子产是代表下级贵族奴隶主开始向地主转化的进步趋势的。他编制田亩，“作丘赋”，“铸刑鼎”（公布成文法）都是进步措施。“作丘赋”就是承认土地私有、对私田一律课税，和鲁国的“初税亩”差不多（郭沫若对鲁“初税亩”即承认土地私有，对私田一律课税，作了很好的分析，见“十批判书”第47页）。他遭到了许多大贵族的反对，他初接受子皮授政的时候，最大的顾虑就是郑国“族大靇多”。子皮支持了他，说“虎（子皮名）帅以听，谁敢犯子？”他才上了台。但上台之后，大族丰卷抓了一个小小的借口（实际是由于子产编制田亩，作丘赋），就集合部属准备杀掉子产。子产没办法，就想逃往晋国。还是老资格的子皮支持了他，才免于难。子产初执政，还不得不对大族有所妥协，但后来却对他们不客气了，如放逐了子南、诛了子晰。子产铸刑书，就遭到了晋国贵族叔向的反对，叔向为此事给子产写了一封信，看看这封信，可以帮助我们了解当时的两大阵营的斗争。该信，文如下：
        “始吾有虞于子，今则已矣！昔先王
    议事以制，不为刑辟，惧民之有争心也，犹不可禁御，是故闲之以义，纠之以政，行之以礼，守之以信，奉之以仁，制为禄位以劝其从，严断刑罚以威其淫，惧其未也，故诲之以忠，耸之以行，教之以务，使之以和，临之以敬，莅之以疆，断之以刚。犹求圣哲之上，明察之官，忠信之长，慈惠之师。民于是乎可任使也，而不生祸乱。民知有辟则不忌于上，并有争心以征于书，而侥幸以成之，弗可为也。夏有乱政而作‘禹刑’，商有乱政而作‘汤刑’，周有乱政而作‘九刑’——三辟之兴，皆叔世也。今子相郑国，作封洫，立谤政，制参辟，铸刑书，将以靖民，不亦难乎？诗曰：‘仪式刑文王之德，日靖四方’，又曰‘仪刑文王，万邦作孚。’民知争端矣，将弃礼而征于书，锥刀之末，将尽争之，乱狱滋丰，贿赂并行，终子之世，郑其败乎？肹闻之：‘国将亡，必多制。’
    其此之谓乎！”你看，这封信加了着重点的地方，不是和老子的政治思想一致，如同一个鼻孔里出气吗？从这里，至少我们在断定老子哲学的阶级性上，会得到一点启发吧！
    说远了，还是拉回本题吧。子产约与老子同时。如上所说，子产在天道观上是一个无神论者（当时也并不只是一个子产，如稍后的范蠡在这一点上也是相当彻底的），这是当时的进步思潮，而不是偶然的，它是当时经济变化、阶级斗争在观念形态上的反映，它是由西周末怨天、恨天、骂天的思想发展而来的。至于当时怀疑天的，就更多了。例如比较保守，主张宗周、“亲亲”的孔子，对天也表示怀疑。在这种情况下，作为没落贵族的一个思想家——老子，创造了唯心主义体系，把绝对精神之“道”放在上帝之先，有什么奇怪呢？而且老子也没有彻底否定人格的神，他一方面说“天地不仁”，一方面又说“天道无亲，常与善人”。比起子产等人的无神论差多了。
    由以上所说看来，老子的所谓“天道观”并不能成为他是唯物主义者的有力根据；如果把老子哲学体系放在战国，那就更不成了。
  关于把老子现代化问题及其他
    冯先生说，甲乙双方都把老子现代化了，据说双方都对古代唯物主义要求太高。我们以为不然，讨论到目前为止，双方都还没有把老子现代化的倾向。
    什么是把老子现代化呢？我们以为不外乎指的这几种情形：（一）就是把现代人的思想硬挂在古人名下，例如把近代唯物主义思想或唯心主义思想硬挂在老子名下。但是，现在认为老子是唯物主义的乙方，也没有把他说成十八世纪的唯物主义，认为老子基本上是唯心主义的甲方，也没有把他说成就是黑格尔。冯先生说，甲方把老子黑格尔化了。我们以为不然。照甲方的解释，老子也没有变成黑格尔。如果说类似，倒是对的；可是在甲方看来老子哲学基本上是“客观”唯心主义，那么它怎能不与黑格尔哲学类似呢？这如同说老子是唯物主义，对老子的解释，也不能不和老子几千年后的旧唯物主义类似一样。这没有什么奇怪。从这里是争论不出什么名堂来的。就是有一方真的把老子现代化了，也需要具体论证。我们以为乙方还没有提出甲方有人把老子黑格尔化的具体论据。（二）把现代名词概念的全部内涵强加于古人。譬如说，关于物质的具体形态的概念，古代人和现代人是有很大的不同的，不能要求古人说的物质原素的概念，必须等于现代的原子、电子等概念。但是却不能因此就认为古代人根本没有“物质”的概念。关于时空观念等等，也是如此。
    例如这一条吧：冯先生说，老子所说的天地万物并不等于现代所说的自然和宇宙，像“自然”和“宇宙”这样一些概念，先秦哲学是很难有的。据说老子没有时空观念，说老子的“道”是超时空的绝对云云，就是把近代的一些观念，强加于老子。果真是这样吗？我们以为不然。
    第一，先秦哲学中怎么没有“自然”和“宇宙”的概念？上下四方曰宇，时间曰“久”（古“久”字即“宙”），“墨经”不是明明讲宇宙吗？先秦人说上下四方六合，庄子说“游于四方六合之外”，这不是时空观念吗？再如“管子”“宙合篇”（还没有人认为不是先秦的著作）说：“天地万物之橐也，宙合有（又）橐天地。天地苴（包裹）万物，故曰万物之橐；宙合之意，上通于天之上，下泉于地之下，外出于四海之外，合络天地，……是大之无外，小之无内，故曰有（又）槖天地。”这不就是时空观念、宇宙观念吗？荀子批评庄子“蔽于天而不知人”，这不是有“自然”的观念吗？这样的材料是引不胜引的。
    第二，说到老子，他说“天长地久”，又说“不失其所者久”，“天地尚不能久”，这不是时间观念吗？说“道”原则上是无形的、是常虚，这不是说它不占有空间吗？从思维的逻辑说：尽管古人可能没有像今人这样明确的时空观念，但是根据他当时的知识，论述他所论述的对象时，不能不以特定的方式，在实际上涉及到那个对象和时空的关系。老子就是一例。这一点，在“论老子哲学体系的唯心主义本质”一文里，已比较详细的答复过，这里不再重复。
    第三，老子所说的“天地”“天下”是否指宇宙万物？这是可以讨论的。它可能是指的头顶的青天，脚踩的大地吧？那样，“道”生天地，就不一定会陷入唯心主义，因为“道”还可能是天地未判之前的混沌。但是老子却说“天下万物生于有，有生于无”，“有”不就把“混沌”等天地未判以前的物质统统包括了吗？老子又说：“道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物”，冯先生也说“一”是“元气”，“二”是阴阳二气；那么既然是元气，它就是最初的物质存在了，可是它又是“道”生出来的。因此我们说，在老子那里是“道”产生宇宙万物——或者说产生所有的物吧，这在什么地方把老子现代化了呢？
    其实，这里也不存在对老子的唯物主义要求高不高的问题。甲乙双方都没有这样一条原则：如果不是纯粹的唯物主义就不是唯物主义，或不是纯粹的唯心主义就不是唯心主义。双方基本上还是具体分析它有多少唯物主义或唯心主义成份。冯先生提出这个意见，作为防止把老子现代化是好的，甲方不要因乙方坚持老子是唯物主义就说老子半点唯物主义因素也没有；乙方也不要因为甲方坚持老子是唯心主义，就说老子是纯粹的唯物主义；但这种倾向，目前在甲乙两方还没有发生。
    还有关于利用注解来解释老子的问题。由汉以来的老子注太多了，这些材料很宝贵，但却也要“死书活读”。
    冯先生说：“有一点要注意：从老子以后，除了庄子发展老子书中的唯心主义成份以外，解释老子的韩非的解老、喻老，淮南子和河上公注，都是用唯物主义观点解释老子。直到王弼老子注，才把老子书的哲学思想解释为唯心主义。这个事实也许说明一点问题吧。”——这里也有“见仁”、“见智”的不同。不错，王弼对老子是作了唯心主义解释的，但是不是从王弼开始，却不一定。淮南子、河上公注是唯物主义的吗？也不见得；我们就不同意这种论断，甲方有许多人不同意。而且汉代学者严君平的“道德指归”就是对老子作唯心主义解释的。有人说今本“道德指归”（残卷）是伪书，但却没有多少证据，是不是伪书，不一定。“解老”、“喻老”确是唯物主义，但我们看来，它偏偏和老子本文，基本上相反。由此看来，问题并不简单，还得从长讨论；讨论的范围恐怕要扩大一些，不要只限于老子本身。甲方引庄子的某些话解释老子，乙方说这是以庄解老，不许可的；因为在乙方看来老子唯物，庄子唯心。乙方引宋鈃、尹文的话（即“管子”书中的“内业”、“白心”、“心术”等篇；郭沫若、刘节已考证清楚这是宋鈃、尹文的著作）解老子，甲方岂不是也可以说乙方是以宋尹解老，也是不能允许的吗？因为在我们看来宋尹基本上是唯物主义，老子基本上是唯心主义。所以，无论甲方还是乙方，无论是引庄、还是引宋尹，还是引淮南子，双方都不要断言对方是以什么解什么，要不得。我们建议，把所谓先秦“道家”（老子、庄子、宋尹等等），都包括进去，一并讨论，问题也许容易解决一些。
