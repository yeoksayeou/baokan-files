Hurry Up and Arrange Autumn Vegetable Production

The summer solstice has passed, and there are only twenty days left before entering the hot season, which is the season for planting autumn vegetables in the north. From late June, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other northern regions have begun planting or are entering the tense stage of preparing to plant autumn vegetables. According to the saying, "radishes in the first ten days of the hot season, cabbage in the second ten days of the hot season," the most important autumn vegetables, radishes and Chinese cabbage, should be planted in the first and second ten days of the hot season. In colder regions, the planting time is even earlier. In northern China, "eating vegetables in winter and spring depends on one autumn." If autumn vegetables are harvested well and stored well, the problem of eating vegetables for almost half a year, from September and October to March and April of the following year, can be solved. Therefore, doing a good job in autumn vegetable production is of extreme importance to ensuring the vegetable supply for the 280 million people in the fourteen northern provinces and cities, especially the 30-plus million urban residents, in the coming winter and spring.

In the past few years, the northern regions have generally attached importance to the production of autumn vegetables, and the yield of autumn vegetables has also increased greatly. According to statistics from forty-five large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas in the north, compared with 1956, the area for autumn vegetables in 1958 expanded by nearly 88%, and the yield increased by nearly 49%. For example, many cities in Heilongjiang Province, although located in the coldest part of China, have achieved an average of one jin of vegetables per person per day since last winter, and have also supported other regions with surplus vegetables. However, despite this, due to the rapid development of industry, the increasing urban population, and the greatly increased consumption of vegetables after the establishment of rural public canteens, the supply of vegetables in cities has still been insufficient since last winter. In order to change this situation and enable the cities and industrial and mining areas in the north to have a sufficient supply of vegetables in the coming winter and spring, it is necessary to immediately seize the preparation work for autumn vegetable production from now on, so as to plant in a timely manner, not miss the agricultural season, and plant more high-yield varieties.

What links should be grasped now to plant this year's autumn vegetables well and produce enough vegetables to eat for a winter and spring?

First, arrange sufficient autumn vegetable planting area. In the past, some regions underestimated the natural disasters and various losses that vegetables might suffer, overestimated the yield per unit area; or were willing to plant more grain and unwilling to plant more vegetables, and only wanted to rely on external supply, so they did not allocate enough land to grow vegetables. Some regions only made plans for the planting area of vegetable fields, but did not specifically implement them, resulting in large plans but poor completion. These have all affected the sufficient supply of autumn vegetables. According to calculations in various places, each person must have one fen or more of autumn vegetable land to ensure that they can generally eat one jin of vegetables a day for about half a year. In areas with poorer production conditions, the planting area of vegetable fields should be even larger than this.

In order to ensure sufficient vegetable land, cities and industrial and mining areas must implement the policy of focusing on vegetables in agricultural production in suburban areas. When the land needed for autumn vegetables conflicts with other crops such as grain and cotton, other crops should give way to autumn vegetables. If the above policy is not implemented and self-reliance is sought, but hope is placed on transfers from other places, it is very unreliable. This year, manpower and transportation capacity are very tight, and the vegetable consumption in various places has also increased greatly, so it is impossible to use a large amount of transportation power to transfer vegetables. Moreover, vegetables are easily perishable. It is better to transport grain from far away than to transport vegetables from far away. Therefore, cities and industrial and mining areas striving for self-sufficiency in vegetables is a long-term policy. It is hoped that all localities will seize the opportunity and carefully check the autumn vegetable planting plan again to ensure that the plan is implemented in the production team and implemented in the land. At the same time, the commercial departments must also sign comprehensive contracts with the production teams according to area, output, quality, variety, and time of market, so as to ensure the implementation of the area, output, and measures.

Secondly, it is necessary to earnestly solve the problem of vegetable seeds. Last year, not many seeds were retained in various places, and this year, the planting area is to be expanded again. The shortage of vegetable seeds has become a prominent problem in the arrangement of autumn vegetables in many regions. Now that the planting season has arrived, efforts should be made immediately from all aspects to adjust the supply of vegetable seeds. Regions that produce vegetable seeds, such as Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces, should mobilize farmers to improve planting methods and save some vegetable seeds to support the northeast and northwest regions that do not produce vegetable seeds or produce fewer vegetable seeds on the premise of ensuring the completion of the planting plan. The southern provinces have more vegetable seeds and should also take out a part to support the north. According to the experience of various places, there are many ways to save vegetable seeds, such as changing broadcasting to spot sowing or seedling transplanting, so that each vegetable seed can grow into a vegetable, and the vegetable seeds originally used for one mu of land can be used for several mu of land. In some places, the price of vegetable seeds is too low and should be adjusted appropriately so that people who grow vegetable seeds are willing to grow more vegetable seeds and people who have vegetable seeds are willing to sell them. The commercial departments should cooperate with the agricultural departments to do a thorough and meticulous job in the purchase and adjustment of vegetable seeds so that all vegetable seeds can be taken out and sown into the ground.

Thirdly, labor should be properly organized to ensure that there are enough people to grow vegetables. Growing vegetables requires more labor than growing grain. With the implementation of spot sowing and seedling transplanting, more labor is needed. Therefore, arrangements must be made in a practical manner. At present, some regions have already taken some relatively good measures. For example, Shenyang City has decided to let the seven or eight thousand people who have recently entered the factories from the suburbs return to grow vegetables. Harbin is preparing to arrange all the mobile population of more than 20,000 laborers in the city who do not have household registration and are unwilling to return to their hometowns to grow vegetables in the suburbs. Wuhan has decided to send all the cadres who have been sent to the countryside for labor training to the communes that produce vegetables. Some communes in other regions have temporarily suspended the community-run industries that do not directly serve agriculture and have drawn some people to grow vegetables. These methods can be imitated. Lanzhou City originally lacked more than 10,000 vegetable-growing laborers. After adopting these methods, the labor problem has now been solved. In addition to arranging long-term vegetable-growing laborers, when more labor is needed in a short period of time, urban residents, government cadres, and transportation vehicles can also be organized to go to the countryside to help. Last year, when Heilongjiang Province was rushing to harvest autumn vegetables, it mobilized 1.1 million person-times and 750,000 vehicle-times to transport more than 4 billion jin of autumn vegetables to the countryside. Heilongjiang Province has a relatively small population, and the autumn vegetables planted last year were also very many, averaging more than four fen of land per person, but their labor problem was still properly solved. It can be seen that as long as other regions attach importance to vegetable production and carry out in-depth and meticulous organization work, the labor problem can definitely be solved. At present, some regions have arranged too little labor to grow vegetables, with an average of one person growing ten mu of vegetable land. This practice must be changed, otherwise it will seriously affect the completion of the autumn vegetable planting task.

In addition to the above-mentioned problems, issues such as fertilizers, drainage and irrigation tools, and pesticides must also be arranged and resolved with attention. Suburban areas close to cities have very convenient conditions for obtaining fertilizers and agricultural machinery and should make full use of them. For example, using urban manure and garbage and sending workers from cities to the countryside to help repair agricultural machinery can solve many problems.

The production and supply of autumn vegetables are an important political task related to the people's livelihood. All regions, especially the northern provinces and major cities and industrial and mining areas, should list it as the primary task of current agricultural production. We hope that the local party committees will immediately take up this work and strive for a greater harvest of autumn vegetables this year.

### 赶快安排秋菜生产

    赶快安排秋菜生产
    夏至已过，离入伏只有二十来天，正是北方播种秋菜的季节。从6月下旬起，黑龙江、内蒙古和北方其他地区，已经开始播种或正进入准备播种秋菜的紧张阶段。按照“头伏萝卜二伏菜”的农谚，秋菜中最主要的萝卜和大白菜，要在头伏和二伏下种。在比较寒冷的地区，下种时间比这还要早。我国北方是“冬春吃菜靠一秋”的，秋菜收得多，储存得好，从9、10月到来年3、4月，差不多整整半年的吃菜问题就可以解决了。因此，做好秋菜生产，对保证北方十四个省、市的二亿八千万人口，特别是其中三千几百万城市人口今冬明春的蔬菜供应，有极重要的意义。
    几年来，北方地区对秋菜的生产一般是重视的，秋菜的产量也有很大的增长。据北方四十五个大、中城市和工矿区统计：1958年和1956年相比，秋菜面积扩大了近88％，产量增加了近49％。例如黑龙江省的许多城市，虽然处在我国最寒冷的地带，但从去冬以来，就做到了每人每天平均吃一斤菜，还把富余的菜支援了外地。然而，尽管如此，由于工业迅速发展，城市人口日益增多，加之农村公共食堂成立后蔬菜的消费量大大提高，去冬以来城市蔬菜的供应仍然感到不足。为了改变这种状况，使北方的城市和工矿区在今冬明春能够有充分的蔬菜供应，就必须从现在起立即抓紧秋菜生产的准备工作，做到适时下种，不误农时，多种高产。
    要把今年的秋菜种好，生产出足够吃一个冬春的蔬菜，目前应当抓住几个什么环节呢？
    首先是安排足够的秋菜播种面积。过去有些地区对蔬菜可能受到的自然灾害和各种损耗估计不够，对单位面积产量估计过高；或者是愿意多种粮食、不愿意多种蔬菜，只想依靠外地供应，因而没有拿出足够的地来种菜。也有的地区对菜田播种面积只订了计划，没有具体落实，结果计划很大，完成很差。这些都影响了秋菜的充分供应。根据各地的计算，平均每人要有秋菜地一分或一分以上，才能保证在半年左右的时间里大体上每天可以吃到一斤蔬菜。在生产条件较差的地区，菜田播种面积比这还要多一些。
    为了保证有足够的菜地，在城市和工矿区，必须贯彻执行近郊区农业生产以菜为主的方针。秋菜需要的土地和粮棉等其他作物发生矛盾时，其他作物应当给秋菜让路。如果不执行以上方针，力求自力更生，而把希望寄托在外地调入，那是很不可靠的。今年人力、运力都十分紧张，各地蔬菜消费量也都大大增加，运输力量不可能大量用来调运蔬菜。而且蔬菜容易腐烂，与其从远地运菜，不如远地运粮。因此城市和工矿区争取蔬菜自给，是一个长远的方针。希望各地赶快抓紧时机，把秋菜播种计划仔细检查一遍，务使计划落实到生产队，落实到地。同时商业部门也必须与生产队按面积、产量、质量、品种、上市时间等全面签定合同，做到面积、产量、措施三落实。
    其次，要认真地解决蔬菜种籽问题，去年各地留种不多，而今年又都要扩大播种面积，菜籽不足已成为许多地区秋菜安排中的突出问题。现在播种时期已到，应当立即从各方面努力，调剂菜籽供应。出菜籽的地区，如河北、河南，山东等省，应该动员农民改进播种方法，在保证完成播种计划的条件下，节约部分菜籽来支援不产菜籽或生产菜籽较少的东北和西北地区。南方各省菜籽比较多，也应当拿出一部分来支援北方。根据各地的经验，节约菜籽的办法是很多的，例如改撒播为点播或育苗栽种，使每一颗菜籽都能长一棵菜，原来供一亩地用的菜籽就可以供几亩地用。有些地方菜籽价格太低，应当作适当调整，使种菜籽的人愿意多种菜籽，有菜籽的人愿意把菜籽卖出来。商业部门应当配合农业部门，深入细致地作好菜籽的收购和调剂工作，使所有的菜籽都能拿出来播到地里。
    再次，要妥善组织劳动力，保证有足够的人种菜。种菜比种粮食要花更多的人工，加上实行点播和育苗移栽，就需要更多的劳动力，因此必须切实作好安排。目前有些地区已经采取了一些比较好的措施。如沈阳市确定让新从郊区进入工厂的七、八千人回去种菜。哈尔滨准备把市内没有户口又不愿回乡的流动人口，约两万多个劳动力，全部安排到郊区种菜。武汉确定把下放劳动锻炼的干部，全部放到生产蔬菜的公社去。还有些地区的公社把不直接为农业服务的社办工业暂时停办，抽出一部分人来种菜。这些办法都是可以仿效的。兰州市原来缺少一万多个种菜的劳动力，采用这些办法安排以后，现在劳力问题已经解决。除了安排长期的种菜的劳动力外，在短期内需要劳力较多的时候，还可以组织城市居民、机关干部和运输工具下乡帮助。去年黑龙江省在抢收秋菜的时候，就动员了一百一十万人次和七十五万车次，到乡下收运了秋菜四十多亿斤。黑龙江省人口比较少，去年种的秋菜又很多，每人平均达到四分多地，但是他们的劳动力问题仍然得到了妥善解决，可见其他地区只要重视蔬菜生产，并进行深入细致的组织工作，劳力问题是一定可以解决的。目前有的地区安排种菜的劳力太少，一个人平均要种十亩菜地，这种作法必须改变，否则就将严重地影响秋菜播种任务的完成。
    除了上述这些问题以外，还有肥料、排灌工具和农药等问题，也必须注意安排解决。靠近城市的郊区，在取得肥料和农业机械方面有很便利的条件，应当充分运用。如利用城市的粪便和垃圾，从城市派工人下乡帮助修理农业机械等，都可以解决许多问题。
    秋菜的生产和供应工作，是关系人民生活的一项重要的政治任务。各个地区，尤其是北方各省和各大中城市以及工矿地区，应当把它列为当前农业生产的首要任务。我们希望各地党委立即把这件工作抓起来，力争今年秋菜获得更大的丰收。
