Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 23rd: Scientific research institutions, universities, and production units in Shanghai are conducting extensive cooperation. They are all adhering to the spirit of placing the state before local interests and others before self, first concentrating major efforts to ensure the completion of key research projects.

Shanghai shoulders heavy scientific research tasks this year, with more than fifty major research projects to be completed first, covering twenty-two areas. Many of these research projects are cutting-edge science and technology, and most are major issues in the current development of production, which cannot be undertaken and resolved by a single unit. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission, scientific and technological personnel throughout the city have formed nineteen professional collaboration groups and established fixed connections with more than four hundred factories. Some research units have partnered with factories to establish research offices, and some factories have set up experimental workshops in universities to jointly conduct research or intermediate trials of new products.

In the spirit of "the whole country as a chessboard" and communist collaboration, all units participating in collaborative research prioritize the state before local interests and others before self, concentrating major efforts to ensure the completion of key research projects. The Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Department of Metallurgy of Jiaotong University, and others are currently working together to research complex iron ore smelting technology, improve the performance of steel, and study various alloy materials, in coordination with the development of the steel industry. The Central Laboratory of the Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau, addressing the problems of high sulfur content in pig iron and coke and short furnace life in steel production this year, has concentrated its efforts on research. Since June, they have increased the average furnace life of converters in the experimental factory from 28.5 furnaces in the first half of May to 63.5 furnaces, and have twice set records of continuous smelting of more than 100 furnaces. While experimenting, they also send technicians to various plants of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company to introduce desulfurization and methods of improving converter furnace life. The Materials Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building in Shanghai, in addition to undertaking the research tasks assigned by the state, also visits relevant factories to understand their needs and formulate this year's scientific research plan. They have working groups in factories such as Shanghai Turbine Factory and Jiangnan Shipyard, working with factory technicians to study the materials and processing technology of precision heavy machinery, which are very popular with the factories.

More than 60% of the researchers at the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have gone deep into the countryside to summarize agricultural high-yield experience. They have formed a comprehensive team to summarize agricultural high-yield experience, as well as groups for photosynthesis, growth hormones, radiobotany, and microbiology, and have established research stations in the suburbs of Shanghai and in rural areas in eight regions across the country. Scientists, together with experienced farmers, participate in all agricultural activities from sowing to harvest, studying the relationship between the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and plant physiology in practice, and preparing to write a treatise on "The Physiological Basis of High Yield of Major Crops in China" based on their research.

The concerted efforts of scientific and technological personnel from various fields, going deep into factories to conduct scientific research, have quickly solved many major technical problems in production. Last year, the Cable Research Institute cooperated with cable factories in Shanghai and Shenyang and Jiaotong University to research and successfully trial-produce China's first set of 110,000-volt and 220,000-volt high-voltage power cables in a short period. This year, these units have gathered more than 30 people in Shanghai to further research and manufacture larger ultra-high-voltage power cables. Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, and Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant, with the collaboration of Jiaotong University and relevant factories and research institutions, successfully trial-produced new types of internal combustion locomotives and electric locomotives for the first time in China last year, and are now further designing and manufacturing new products. Due to collaboration, China's locomotive manufacturing level has developed rapidly in a relatively short period. In the field of textile science, around the three major issues of high-speed production, development of cutting-edge technology, and technical transformation of old factories, more than 1,000 textile scientific and technological personnel from research units, factories, and universities throughout the city have been organized. New technologies such as jet looms and facsimile engraving, which were previously carried out separately by research institutes and factories last year, have been greatly accelerated this year due to organized collaboration.

Various research institutions and universities are equipped with a considerable number of scientific and technological personnel who, together with factory technicians, are engaged in the research and trial manufacture of basic materials for cutting-edge science and technology. For example, research and manufacture of radio components, electron tubes, and precision instruments are currently underway.

    先国家后地方　先别人后自己
    上海科学研究机关和生产单位协作猛攻重点项目
    据新华社上海23日电　上海科学研究机关、高等学校和生产单位正开展广泛的协作。他们都本着先国家后地方、先人后己的精神，首先集中主要力量，保证完成重点研究项目。
    上海市今年担负着繁重的科学研究任务，首先要完成的重大研究项目就有五十多项，包括二十二个方面。这些研究项目中，不少是尖端科学技术，大部分是当前发展生产中的重大问题，都不是一个单位所能承担和解决的。在上海市科学技术委员会的领导下，全市科学技术人员组成了十九个专业协作组，并且同四百多个工厂建立固定联系，有的研究单位与工厂合作成立研究室，有的工厂在高等学校中设立试验性车间，共同合作研究或进行新产品的中间试制。
    各协作研究的单位，在发扬“全国一盘棋”和共产主义大协作精神下，都是先国家后地方、先人后己地集中主要力量来保证完成重点研究项目。中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所、交通大学冶金系等，配合钢铁工业发展，目前正在分工研究复杂铁矿的冶炼技术，改进钢铁的性能，研究多种合金材料。上海市冶金局中心试验室针对今年钢铁生产中生铁、焦炭含硫高，炉龄短的问题，集中力量进行研究。6月份以来，已在试验工厂里将转炉炉龄从5月上半月的平均二十八点五炉提高到六十三点五炉，并两次创造连续冶炼一百炉以上的纪录。他们一面试验，一面就派出技术人员到上钢各厂介绍脱硫和提高转炉炉龄的经验。第一机械工业部设在上海的材料研究所除了承担国家交给的研究任务以外，还遍访有关工厂，了解需要，制订出今年的科学研究计划。他们在上海汽轮机厂、江南造船厂等工厂里都设有工作组，同工厂技术人员一起研究精密重型机械的材料和加工工艺问题，深受工厂的欢迎。
    中国科学院植物生理研究所60％以上的研究人员都深入农村，总结农业丰产经验。他们组成总结农业丰产经验综合队和光合作用、生长素、放射植物学、微生物等组，在上海市郊和全国八个地区的农村中设立研究站。科学家们同老农一起，参加从播到收的全部农事活动，从实践中研究农业“八字宪法”对植物生理的关系，准备在研究的基础上写出“中国主要作物高产的生理基础”论著。
    各方面科学技术人员通力协作，深入工厂搞科学研究，使生产中许多重大技术问题很快得到了解决。电缆研究所去年同上海、沈阳两地的电缆厂和交通大学合作，短期内研究并试制成功了国内第一套十一万伏和二十二万伏高压电力电缆。今年这些单位又集中三十多人在上海进一步研究制造更大型的超高压电力电缆。青岛四方机车车辆厂、戚墅堰机车车辆厂和湘潭电机厂等厂，由于得到交通大学和有关工厂、研究机关的协作，去年第一次试制出了国内新型的内燃机车和电气机车，现在又在进一步设计制造新的产品。由于协作，使我国的机车制造水平在较短时间内有了迅速的发展。纺织科学方面，围绕着高速度生产、发展尖端技术和老厂技术改造三个大问题，把全市研究单位和工厂、高等学校的一千多名纺织科学技术人员都组织起来了。去年由研究院和各厂分散进行的喷气织机、传真雕刻等新技术，今年由于组织协作，进展大大加快了。
    各研究机关和高等学校都配备有相当数量的科学技术人员，同工厂技术人员一起，从事尖端科学技术基础材料的研究试制。如研究制造无线电元件、电子管、精密仪器等，目前都在积极进行。
