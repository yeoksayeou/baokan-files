    People on the Water Moving Ashore

    Under the leadership of the Party committee and with the support of relevant departments, the Jianhu County Transportation Company in Jiangsu Province recently built a new village for people living on the water. The new village has more than 60 mu of land and more than 70 houses, as well as a primary school, kindergarten, nursery, public canteen, and cement and lime kilns. Three hundred and sixty-five family members of boat people have moved into the new water village to settle down, ending their wandering life of generations who took water as their home and boats as their houses. When they moved, they also brought more than 1,500 pieces of furniture and supplies such as jars, basins, and pots ashore, freeing up 203 tons of cabin space, which is of great benefit to solving the current difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity.

    The boat people and their families all regard moving to the new water village as a great happy event, and they thanked the Party and the government for their kind care.

    水上人家上岸来
    江苏建湖县运输公司在党委的领导和有关部门的支持下，最近建成了水上新村。新村有土地六十多亩，房屋七十多间，还有小学、幼儿园、托儿所、公共食堂和水泥、石灰窑厂。船民家属三百六十五人已经搬进了水上新村定居，结束了世世代代以水为乡，以船为家的漂泊生活。他们搬家的时候，把缸、盆、罐等家具用品一千五百多件也带上岸来，腾出了舱位二百零三吨，这对解决目前运力不足的困难有不少好处。
    船民和船民家属都把移居水上新村看成一件大喜事，他们同声感谢党和政府对他们的亲切关怀。
