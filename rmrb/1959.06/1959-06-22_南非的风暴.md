    South Africa's Storm
    By Our Staff Commentator
    Following the successive outbreaks of anti-colonialist struggles on the African continent this year, a massive struggle against racial discrimination and persecution by the white government has now erupted in South Africa. Beginning on June 18, tens of thousands of Africans in the South African port of Durban braved the brutal suppression of the police and joined in large-scale demonstrations against racial oppression. Currently, the Durban African demonstrations are spreading along the Natal coast of eastern South Africa.
    The Durban incident has thrown the South African authorities into a panic. On the one hand, they are transferring a large number of military police from Johannesburg to Durban to suppress the demonstrators; on the other hand, they are feigning calmness, trying to portray the African demonstrations as merely a dispute over "beer." A South African colonial government minister, De Wet Nel, said: "The unrest occurred because customers of African women making illegal beverages were drawn to the municipality's beer halls -- which shows that Africans need their beer." But everyone knows that the beer issue is only the fuse for the outbreak of the struggle, and there are profound reasons behind it. As local African opinion points out, the reason why the South African ruling authorities want to prohibit African women from brewing beer is to cut off their livelihoods and drive them to the so-called African "reserves." This is an extremely vicious means of the racial discrimination and oppression policy pursued by the South African authorities. Therefore, this is not just a "beer" issue, but a struggle of black Africans against the South African authorities' barbaric racial discrimination and oppression policies.
    Everyone knows that the Union of South Africa has the most barbaric system of racial oppression. The white government of South Africa has enacted more than sixty racial discrimination laws, depriving Africans of all political, educational, and basic personal freedoms, in order to carry out the most brutal colonial exploitation against them. There, millions of black Africans are driven into overcrowded so-called "reserves" or forced to work as forced laborers on white plantations and mines; and a large number of Africans are completely trapped in unemployment and lose all guarantees of life. The people of South Africa, living in this prison, must rise up to fight for their right to live, which is of course inevitable. As long as there is kindling, the fire will always burn. Commenting on the Durban incident on June 19, the British bourgeois newspaper "Manchester Guardian" said, "There is so much universal discontent in the lives of Africans that a small incident can often ignite a very destructive wildfire like a spark falling on dry grass." The "Manchester Guardian" calls the anti-colonialist struggle of the African people "destructive," which shows its colonialist position, but what it says is a relatively true reflection of the current situation in South Africa and the entire African colony.
    Not long ago, the South African Minister of Foreign Affairs, Louw, said that the attitude of the independent African countries towards the South African authorities was "not only unfriendly, but unfortunately even hostile." This is a frank confession. In fact, not only the people of African countries, but the people of the whole world abhor colonialism and its derivative system of racial discrimination, because the existence of this system is a disgrace to modern mankind and a disgrace to our century. The South African people's struggle against racial discrimination will undoubtedly receive the sympathy and support of freedom-loving people in Africa and the world.

    南非的风暴
    本报评论员
    继今年非洲大陆上接二连三地爆发的反殖民主义斗争之后，现在南非又爆发了声势浩大的反抗白人政府种族歧视和迫害的斗争。从6月18日开始，在南非的德班港口，有数万非洲人冒着警察的残暴镇压，卷入了反抗种族压迫的大示威。目前德班非洲人的示威斗争，正在沿着南非东部纳塔尔海岸蔓延中。
    德班事件使南非当局惊慌失措了。他们一面从约翰内斯堡增调大批军警到德班去镇压示威者：一面又佯作镇静，力图把非洲人的示威运动说成仅仅是为了“啤酒”之争。南非殖民政府的一个部长德威特尼尔说：“动乱的发生在于自制非法饮料的非洲妇女的顾客都被市政府的啤酒店拉去——这表明非洲人需要他们的啤酒。”但是谁都清楚，啤酒问题不过是斗争爆发的导火线而已，在其背后有着深刻的原因。正如当地非洲人舆论所指出的，南非统治当局之所以要禁止非洲妇女自制啤酒，是企图借此断绝她们的生计，而把她们驱逐到所谓非洲人的“保留地”去。而这是南非当局所奉行的种族歧视和压迫政策的一个极其毒辣的手段。因此，这不仅仅是什么“啤酒”问题，而是一场非洲黑人反抗南非当局的野蛮的种族歧视和压迫政策的斗争。
    大家都知道，南非联邦存在着最野蛮的种族压迫制度。南非的白人政府制订了六十余种种族歧视的法令，剥夺了非洲人的一切政治、教育及起码的人身自由权利，以便于对他们进行最残酷的殖民剥削。在那里，成百万非洲黑人被驱入拥挤不堪的所谓“保留地”，或被迫到白人种植园及矿场去从事强迫劳动；还有大批非洲人完全陷于失业的困境，而失去了生活的一切保障。生活在这座监狱里的南非人民，为了自己的生活权利，要起来进行斗争，这当然是不可避免的。只要火种存在，火总是要烧起来的。英国资产阶级报纸“曼彻斯特卫报”6月19日在评论德班事件时说，“在非洲人的生活中有这样多的事情引起普遍的不满，以至一件小的事件常常可能像落在干草上的一粒火星一样，燃起破坏性很大的熊熊野火。”“曼彻斯特卫报”把非洲人民的反殖民主义斗争称为是“破坏性”的，这表明了它的殖民主义的立场，但是它所讲的这一段话倒是比较真实地反映了目前南非以至整个非洲殖民地的状况。
    不久前，南非联邦外交部长赫劳说，非洲各独立国家对南非当局的态度“不仅是不友好的，甚至不幸是仇视的。”这倒是一个坦率的供状。其实，岂止是非洲各国人民，全世界人民都憎恶殖民主义及其派生出来的种族歧视制度，因为这个制度的存在是现代人类的耻辱，是我们这个世纪的耻辱。南非人民反抗种族歧视的斗争，无疑将受到非洲和全世界爱好自由人民的同情和支持。
