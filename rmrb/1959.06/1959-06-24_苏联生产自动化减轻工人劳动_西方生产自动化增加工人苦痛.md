Soviet Production Automation Lightens Workers' Labor
Western Production Automation Increases Workers' Suffering

The issue of production automation is one of the topics for discussion at the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee opening today. It is no accident that the convocation of this plenary session has aroused warm responses and ignited a new wave of socialist competition among the working people throughout the Soviet Union. Because, under the socialist system, production automation means raising the people's living standards, reducing labor, shortening the working day and working week, and creating excellent learning conditions for the working people.

In capitalist countries, the situation is completely different. Production automation only brings new profits to capitalists, while bringing unemployment and increased labor intensity to workers.

The same automation yields completely different results due to different social systems. For example, the bearing assembly process in the first workshop of the Saratov Bearing Plant in the Soviet Union recently implemented automation, reducing two workers. These two workers were immediately assigned to work in other sections and even received a wage increase, while the four workers remaining in the original process, due to improved technical skills and the ability to skillfully operate the machines, received wage increases of 200 to 400 rubles respectively. Since the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Stalingrad "Red October" factory implemented automation last year, steelworkers no longer need to look into the scorching furnace with their eyes, nor do they have to personally take care of the supply of fuel and air. Now they only need to look at the instruments and press the buttons; and their wages have increased by at least 17%. Due to the implementation of automation, the steelworkers of this factory have shortened their working week: working four days and resting for two days. Therefore, workers have generally participated in night schools and correspondence schools for study.

In capitalist countries, "automation" is a very terrible word among workers. For example, at the large steel plant of "Dortmund-Horde United Steel Corporation" in West Germany, 130 workers were laid off due to the implementation of automation last year, and 10,000 workers worked 36 or 37 hours a week with reduced wages. On average, each worker lost 150 to 200 marks per month.

In the United States, automobile factories are considered to have the most modern equipment. At the "Ford Motor Company" factory in Cleveland, after the automation of the automobile pulley assembly process, machines displaced 92 workers. In Soviet factories, as introduced above, automation can improve the technical level of workers, but in the "Ford Motor Company" factory, skilled workers only account for 10%. The branch of the "Renault" automobile factory, which is praised by American experts as one of the most advanced enterprises in the world, actually does not even have a single skilled worker.

In capitalist countries, due to capitalists' pursuit of maximum profits, the labor intensity of those workers who operate automated machines has reached an alarming level. For example, the "Simca" automobile factory in France needs to set up a so-called "oxygen room" to allow workers who are exhausted by the "speed-up system" promoted by capitalists to regain consciousness. In some metallurgical enterprises in France, in order to enable workers to keep up with the working speed of the presses, the workers' hands are tied to the machines!

At the Hiroshima Telegraph Office in Japan, due to the adoption of automated equipment, workers are constantly in a state of intense tension under the supervision of supervisors. Workers said: "After work, it takes at least two hours for the spirit to return to normal. During these two hours, it is impossible to even read or watch movies." People in various departments of this telegraph office often ask for leave, and most of these people who ask for leave suffer from diseases that are difficult to diagnose. (Fang)

### 苏联生产自动化减轻工人劳动  西方生产自动化增加工人苦痛

    苏联生产自动化减轻工人劳动
    西方生产自动化增加工人苦痛
    生产自动化问题，是今天开幕的苏共中央全会讨论的议题之一。这次全会的召开所以在全苏劳动人民中间引起了热烈的反应，激起了新的社会主义竞赛热潮，并不是偶然的。因为，在社会主义制度下，生产自动化就意味着提高人民生活水平，减轻劳动，缩短工作日和工作周，为劳动人民创造优越的学习条件。
    在资本主义国家里，情况就完全两样了。生产自动化只是给资本家带来新的利润，给工人带来的却是失业和劳动强度的增加。
    同是自动化，由于社会制度的不同，结果也截然两样。例如，苏联萨拉托夫轴承工厂第一车间的轴承装配工序，不久以前实行了自动化，精减了两名工人。这两个工人立即分配了其他工段工作，而且还增加了工资，而留在原工序上的四个工人，因为提高了技术水平，能够熟练地操纵机器，工资分别增加了二百至四百卢布。斯大林格勒“红十月”工厂平炉车间，自从去年实行了自动化以来，炼钢工人再也用不着用眼睛往灼热的炉里看了，也用不着亲自照管燃料和空气的供应了，现在他们只要看看仪表，按按电钮就成了；而且工资至少增加了17％。由于实行了自动化，这个工厂的炼钢工人已缩短了工作周：每工作四天休息两天，因此，工人普遍都参加了夜校和函授学校的学习。
    在资本主义国家里，“自动化”在工人中间是个十分可怕的名词。例如，西德的“多特蒙德—霍德联合钢铁股份公司”的大钢铁厂，去年由于实行了自动化，有一百三十名工人被解雇，一万名工人在降低工资的情况下每周工作三十六、七小时。平均每个工人每个月损失了一百五十至二百马克。
    在美国，拥有最现代化设备的要算是汽车工厂了。在克里夫兰“福特汽车公司”工厂里，装配汽车滑轮工序实行自动化以后，机器排挤了九十二名工人。在苏联的工厂里，如上面所介绍的，自动化能提高工人的技术水平，但是在“福特汽车公司”工厂里，熟练工人只占10％。被美国专家们吹捧为世界最先进的企业之一的“雷诺”汽车工厂的分厂，实际上连一名熟练工人也没有。
    在资本主义国家里，由于资本家追逐最高额的利润，那些操纵自动化机器工人的劳动强度之高，已经达到惊人的程度。例如法国的“西姆卡”汽车工厂，需要设立一种所谓“氧气室”，让那些被资本家推行的“赶快制度”弄得疲惫不堪的工人恢复知觉。在法国的某些冶金企业里，为了使工人能赶上压榨机的工作速度，竟将工人的双手捆在机器上！
    在日本广岛电报局，由于采用了自动化设备，工人在监工的监督下，神经不断处于强烈的紧张状态。工人们说：“下工后，至少要过两小时精神才能恢复正常，在这两小时中间连读书、看电影都不可能。”这个电报局的各部门经常都有人请假，这些请假的人多半是患了难以判断的疾病。　（方）
