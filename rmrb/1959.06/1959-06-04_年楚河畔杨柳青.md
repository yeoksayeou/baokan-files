Now, on the banks of the rich Nyang Chu River, it is a season of gentle breezes, flowing water, and green willows. The Five-Star Red Flags on the tops of many buildings along the riverbank and the green willows swaying in the wind complement each other. The fields are lush green, and thousands upon thousands of farmers are happily and diligently working the land. They sing:

	With our diligent hands,
	We happily grasp the plow and hoe,
	On this rich and vast land,
	We break new ground and practice "whoever sows, reaps."

An old Tibetan farmer, Cai Ren Nima, told me that the farmers are all feeling relaxed now, and everyone wants to strive for the first good harvest after the victory of the suppression of the rebellion. Jia Yang, a farmer from Jin’ga Village, leads the villagers in staying in the fields from morning to night, irrigating, applying fertilizer, building canals, etc. Although they are sweating profusely, their weather-beaten faces always show happy smiles.

In the past, the farmers of Jin’ga Village, like farmers in other parts of Tibet, were cruelly exploited and enslaved by feudal serf owners for generations. Jia Yang owed the big serf owner one hundred bottles of silver (each bottle worth three yuan, three jiao, three fen) and an annual interest of sixty bottles. In less than two years, he was unable to repay the high-interest loan, and he was left destitute. Because of this, the big serf owner's henchmen supervised him with whips, forcing him to work like an animal. He not only had no personal freedom, but even to urinate, he had to have a mark stamped on his face. If there were too many marks on his face, he would be denied food and whipped. The serfs who lived such a miserable life did not own a single piece of land. In their homes, it was difficult to find even half a bag of zanba or a piece of clothing to cover their bodies. Farmer Duo Bu Ji said, "In those days, I don't know how many people were forced to die." Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the farmers of Jin’ga Village have urgently demanded reform to abolish the cruel, dark, and barbaric serf system. However, due to the obstruction of the reactionary Tibetan local government and the big serf owners, their wishes could not be realized. Some farmers said sadly that they were like dead trees on the banks of the Nyang Chu River, with withered roots, empty hearts, and fallen leaves, with no hope of turning green again.

But Jia Yang always thought, "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party will never forget our suffering Tibetan people. The day will dawn, and the sun will surely come out!" He often told other poor farmers about his longing for reform. When this situation was heard by the reactionary big bully of Jin’ga, he immediately arrested him, put him in shackles and handcuffs, and threw him into prison. He whipped Jia Yang until he was covered in cuts and bruises, without a single good spot, and also forced him to join the rebels, but Jia Yang refused to go even if he died. When Jia Yang was tortured to the point of near death, the villagers, willing to go hungry, scraped together some money, butter, and meat to "plead" with the big bully. Only then was the innocent Jia Yang released.

After the People's Liberation Army quelled the rebellion of the reactionary upper-class clique in Tibet, the Jiangzi Military Control Commission’s work team gave the farmers of Jin’ga a large amount of grain and spring planting seeds, and also announced "whoever plants the land of the rebels will harvest the crops.” Upon hearing this good news, not a single poor farmer was not excited and cheering. Many people in groups, talking, laughing, singing, and dancing, were so happy that they could not sleep at night. They greeted each other with "Tashi Delek" and shouted "Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Pu Ji Ba, a farmer in his seventies, said happily: "We have been cattle and horses for several lifetimes, and we didn't even have the right to speak. Now that the rebels and demons have just been eliminated, we can pour out our grievances and dig up the bitter roots. After the reform, our happiness will be indescribable. This is really like a dead tree sprouting, growing tender roots, and the trunk growing stronger, the branches and leaves growing more luxuriantly, like the green willows by the Nyang Chu River."

    年楚河畔杨柳青
    新华社记者　格来
    现在，富饶的年楚河两岸，正是风和日丽，流水潺潺、杨柳青青的季节。河畔上许多建筑物顶上的五星红旗，和临风摇曳的绿柳交相辉映，田野上一片葱绿，成千上万的农民们正在愉快辛勤地进行耕作。他们歌唱着：
    用我们勤劳的双手，
    高高兴兴紧握犁和锄，
    在富饶辽阔的土地上，
    开天辟地进行“谁种谁收”。
    年老的藏族农民才仁尼玛告诉我，现在农民们个个心情舒坦，大家要争取平叛胜利后的第一个丰收。金嘎村的农民嘉扬带领全村农民，从早到晚不离开田地，灌水追肥，兴修水渠等，虽然忙得头上直冒汗，但他们那饱经风霜的脸上，随时流露着幸福的微笑。
    过去金嘎村的农民和西藏其他地区的农民一样，世世代代受着封建农奴主的残酷剥削和奴役。嘉扬因为欠了大农奴主一百瓶银子（每瓶合三元三角三分），每年利息六十瓶，不到两年，他还不清利上加利的高利贷就倾家荡产了。正因为这样，大农奴主的帮凶手持皮鞭监督着他像牛马一般的劳役。不仅没有人身自由，就连小便一次，也要在脸上盖一个印作标记，如果脸上的印多了，还要不给饭吃和挨一顿皮鞭。过着苦难日子的农奴，没有一块土地。在他们的家里，很难找到半口袋糌粑和一件能蔽体的衣服。农民多布吉说：“在那样的日子里，不知有多少人被活活逼死了。”自从西藏和平解放后，金嘎村的农民便迫切要求改革，废除残酷、黑暗、野蛮的农奴制度。可是由于反动的西藏地方政府和大农奴主的百般阻挠，他们的愿望不能实现，有些农民悲伤地说，他们是年楚河畔的枯树，枯了根、空了心、落了叶，没有发青的希望了。
    但嘉扬的心里总是想，“毛主席、共产党绝不会忘记我们受苦受难的藏民，天总会亮，太阳一定会出来的！”他把渴望改革的心情，经常向其他的贫苦农民们诉说。这个情况被金嘎的反动大恶霸听到以后，立即把他逮捕，上了脚镣手铐押进监狱，用皮鞭打得嘉扬遍体鳞伤，没有一块好地方，还威逼他去参加叛匪，可是嘉扬死也不肯去。当嘉扬被折磨得快要死去的时候，全村农民宁愿挨饿，拼凑了一些钱、酥油和肉，到大恶霸那里去“求情”，无罪的嘉扬这才被释放出来。
    人民解放军平息了西藏上层反动集团的叛乱以后，江孜军管会工作组救济了金嘎的农民大批的口粮和春耕种子，还宣布了“叛匪土地谁种谁收”。得到这个喜讯，没有一个穷苦的农民不激动不欢呼，很多人成伙成群，又说又笑，又唱又舞，高兴得夜晚睡不着觉。他们互道“扎西德勒”，高呼共产党万岁！毛主席万寿无疆！
    七十多岁的农民普吉巴高兴地说：“我们作了几辈子牛马，连说话的权利都没有，现在叛匪、恶魔刚一消灭，就能吐苦水、挖苦根，等改革以后，我们的幸福更说不完啦，这真是好比枯树发了芽，生了嫩根，越长树干越壮、枝叶越茂，像年楚河边的杨柳一片青了。”
