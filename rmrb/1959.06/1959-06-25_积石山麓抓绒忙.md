The good season for grabbing goat cashmere, horse mane, horse tail, and cow tail in the northern foothills of Mount Jishi, in Qinghai Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, has arrived. All parts of the prefecture have organized labor forces to carry out a concentrated wool grabbing effort. Commercial departments in various places have supplied more than 3,000 shearing shears and wool grabbers, helped communes train technical personnel, and have gone deep into various places to purchase the products in a timely manner.
