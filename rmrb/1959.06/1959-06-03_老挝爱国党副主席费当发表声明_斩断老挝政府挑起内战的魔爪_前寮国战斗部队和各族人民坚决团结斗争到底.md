Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st: According to a report from a Vietnam News Agency reporter from the Vietnam-Laos border, Phay Dang, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, recently issued a statement condemning the behavior of the Phoui Sananikone government in provoking civil war under the instigation of U.S. imperialism.

The statement said: "Since May 11 this year, the Phoui Sananikone government has ordered the encirclement of the former Lao fighting forces, cutting off their supply lines and attempting to disarm them, making the situation in Laos extremely serious. Currently, the Sananikone government is provoking and continuing to expand the civil war in Laos."

The statement pointed out that the Sananikone government's conspiracy is to force the former Lao fighting forces to surrender their arms and further eliminate them; then amend the kingdom's constitution to abolish all democratic freedoms and restrict the people's right to vote; and at the same time arrest and persecute all patriotic people in order to consolidate their disastrous system and gradually turn Laos into a U.S. colony and military base.

The statement said that the Lao Royal Government also sent military police to surround and place under house arrest the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Party, including Prince Souphanouvong, and some other members of parliament, arresting or concentrating the cadres of the Lao Patriotic Party in various places.

The statement said that in the past ten days or so, the situation in Xieng Khouang province has deteriorated drastically. After the Second Battalion of the former Lao fighting forces here was surrounded, it had to withdraw from the Plain of Jars to avoid conflict. The Sananikone government mobilized a large number of troops, including artillery and paratroopers, to attack this battalion.

The statement said that on May 25, the Sananikone government announced that it would use force to eliminate the former Lao fighting forces and openly provoked the civil war in Laos. In recent days, in eastern Xieng Khouang province, the war has become increasingly fierce. The Sananikone government's troops opened fire on the former Lao fighting forces in Muong Phan, and the former Lao fighting forces fought bravely in self-defense and repelled the attacks of the Royal Government's troops. However, the Sananikone government continues to reinforce its troops, attempting to expand the civil war in Laos in order to realize their conspiracy to eliminate the former Lao fighting forces.

The statement said that the agreement signed between the Lao Royal Government and the former Lao fighting forces was based on the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The purpose of these agreements is for national reconciliation, national unification, and to make Laos peacefully unified, independent, neutral, and prosperous. This is in line with the wishes of all strata and ethnic groups of the Lao people. This fully expresses the good wishes of the former Lao fighting forces and today's Lao Patriotic Party for the nation, the motherland, and the people, and therefore they have won the sympathy and support of the Lao people of all ethnic groups and peace-loving people of the world. The statement said that the Sananikone government openly violated the Geneva Accords and tore up the agreement signed between the Lao Royal Government and the former Lao fighting forces.

The statement then listed a large number of facts about the Sananikone government's violation of the Geneva Accords and the agreements signed between Laos and the former Lao fighting forces. The statement also demanded that the actions of launching a civil war in Laos be stopped immediately; that the Royal Army currently surrounding and attacking the former Lao fighting forces be withdrawn immediately; that the illegal orders to surround and place the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Party under house arrest be revoked immediately; that all cadres of the former Lao fighting forces who have been illegally imprisoned and concentrated under surveillance be released; that the people's democratic freedoms be guaranteed; that the power of the National Assembly be respected; that all agreements signed between the Lao Royal Government and the former Lao fighting forces be thoroughly implemented; that the Geneva Accords be strictly implemented; and that the International Commission be restored in Laos.

The statement said: "Currently, the Sananikone government has created a situation in which Laotians are fighting Laotians and brothers are killing each other. The soldiers of the former Lao fighting forces are bravely fighting for self-defense and to defend justice. The Lao people of all strata and ethnic groups will resolutely unite to oppose the Sananikone government's conspiracy of sowing discord and deception. They will resolutely work together with the former Lao fighting forces to sever the claws of the Sananikone government in provoking civil war and resolutely fight for the realization of national harmony, national unification, peaceful neutrality, democracy, and independence."

The statement concluded by pointing out that the Phoui Sananikone government, which betrays the will of the people, will inevitably be defeated, and the struggle of all the Lao people for justice, for the motherland, and for the people will inevitably be victorious.

    老挝爱国党副主席费当发表声明
    斩断老挝政府挑起内战的魔爪
    前寮国战斗部队和各族人民坚决团结斗争到底
    新华社河内1日电　据越南通讯社记者从越南—老挝边境发回的消息报道，老挝爱国党中央委员会副主席费当最近发表声明，谴责培·萨纳尼空政府在美帝国主义指使下挑起内战的行为。
    声明说：从今年5月11日起，培·萨纳尼空政府下令包围前寮国战斗部队，切断他们的供应线和企图解除他们的武装，使老挝的局势非常严重。目前萨纳尼空政府正在挑起和继续扩大老挝的内战。
    声明指出，萨纳尼空政府的阴谋是要迫使前寮国战斗部队缴械，并进一步消灭他们；然后修改王国的宪法，以废除一切民主自由权利，限制人民的选举权；同时逮捕和迫害一切爱国人士，以巩固他们祸国殃民的制度，逐步把老挝变为美国的殖民地和军事基地。
    声明说，老挝王国政府还派军警包围和软禁包括苏发努冯亲王在内的老挝爱国党的领袖和其他一些国会议员，逮捕或集中管制老挝爱国党在各地的干部。
    声明说，最近十几天来，川圹省的局势极端恶化。在这里的前寮国战斗部队第二营被包围后，只好撤离镇宁平原以免发生冲突。萨纳尼空政府调动了包括炮兵和伞兵在内的大批兵力进攻这个营。
    声明说，5月25日萨纳尼空政府宣布要用武力消灭前寮国战斗部队，并且公然挑起了老挝的内战。最近几天，在川圹省东部，战事日益激烈。萨纳尼空政府的军队向孟坊的前寮国战斗部队开火，前寮国战斗部队英勇战斗以自卫，并且击退了王国政府军队的进攻。然而萨纳尼空政府仍然继续增援兵力，企图扩大在老挝的内战，以实现他们消灭前寮国战斗部队的阴谋。
    声明说，老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，是以日内瓦协议的条款为依据的。这些协议的目的是为了民族和解，统一国家，使老挝和平统一、独立、中立和繁荣。这是符合老挝各阶层和各族人民的愿望的。这充分表达了前寮国战斗部队和今天的老挝爱国党为民族、为祖国和为人民着想的良好愿望，因此他们获得了老挝各族人民和世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持。声明说，可是萨纳尼空政府公然破坏日内瓦协议，撕毁老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队所签订的协议。
    声明接着列举了萨纳尼空政府违反日内瓦协议和老挝和前寮国战斗部队双方签订的协议的大量事实。声明并且要求，立即停止在老挝发动内战的行动；要求立即撤走正在包围和进攻前寮国战斗部队的王国军队；立即撤消非法包围和软禁老挝爱国党领袖的命令；释放所有被非法监禁和被集中看管的前寮国战斗部队的干部；要求保障人民的民主自由权利；尊重国会的权力，彻底履行老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的各项协议；严正履行日内瓦协议；恢复国际委员会在老挝的活动。
    声明说：“目前，萨纳尼空政府已经造成了老挝人打老挝人、兄弟互相残杀的局面，前寮国战斗部队的战士们为自卫和保卫正义正在进行英勇的战斗。老挝各阶层、各族人民将坚决团结一致，反对萨纳尼空政府挑拨离间和欺骗的阴谋。他们将坚决同前寮国战斗部队同心协力，斩断萨纳尼空政府挑起内战的魔爪，坚决为实现民族和睦、国家统一、和平中立、民主和独立而斗争。”
    声明最后指出，背叛人民意愿的培·萨纳尼空政府必将遭到失败，全体老挝人民为正义、为祖国和为人民的斗争，必将获得胜利。
