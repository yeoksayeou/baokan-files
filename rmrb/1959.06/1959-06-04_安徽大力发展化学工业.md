Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Anhui Province is adopting a method that combines foreign and indigenous techniques to vigorously develop the production of acids, alkalis, and various reagents required for steel production. In the past few months, the province has successfully trial-produced 115 kinds of chemical products, of which 52 have been officially put into production.

	The Huainan and Ma'anshan fertilizer plants are collaborating to extract vanadium pentoxide from steel slag and have further successfully trial-produced "vanadium catalyst," solving the urgent need for reagents in sulfuric acid production. Small sulfuric acid plants and soda ash plants run by the masses in areas such as Hefei, Anqing, and Wuhu have also successively produced alkali and acid. The Hefei Comprehensive Chemical Plant is tapping the potential of its enterprise, increasing the variety of products from six last year to more than ten, including many reagents needed for steel production.

    安徽大力发展化学工业
    新华社讯安徽省采取洋土结合的方针，大力发展酸、碱和钢铁生产所需的各种试剂的生产。几个月来，全省试制成功的各种化工产品已达一百一十五种，其中有五十二种产品已经正式投入生产。
    淮南、马鞍山两个肥料厂进行协作，从炼钢炉渣中提取了五氧化二钒，并进一步试制成功“钒触媒”，解决了硫酸生产急需的试剂。合肥、安庆、芜湖等地区群众举办的小型硫酸厂和纯碱厂，也都先后出碱出酸。合肥综合化工厂挖掘企业内部潜力，使产品品种由去年的六种增加到十多种，其中有多种是为钢铁生产所需要的试剂。
