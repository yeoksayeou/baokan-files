    Eliminating the Feudal System, Developing Collective Production
    Border People's Lives Flourish

    This newspaper reports that the 1.7 million minority people in the Yunnan border region, who were long under the feudal system, have rapidly embarked on a path of progress and prosperity after completing land reform through peaceful consultation.

    In the first year after the completion of land reform in the border region—1957—there was significant development in production. Grain production generally increased by 10% to 15%, 2,077 agricultural cooperatives were established, and peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 21.9% of the total number of peasant households. Agricultural cooperatives increased production by 20% to 30%, with some cooperatives increasing production by more than 100%. In 1958, the production and cooperativization movements in the border region developed simultaneously and promoted each other. Grain production increased by about 50% compared to 1957, with an average grain yield of 1,000 jin per person. The number of cooperatives also increased to 6,379. This year, the border region has launched a production upsurge for continued great leaps forward. The summer crops in the border region have already achieved a bumper harvest. Hani farmers in Jinping, Yuanyang, Honghe, and other counties on the south bank of the Red River planted wheat on a large scale for the first time and achieved a splendid yield of 400 jin per mu. At the same time, cooperativization has been basically realized in the border areas, and people's communes have been established in some areas. With the elimination of the feudal system and the development of collective production, the historical divisions between ethnic groups, regions, and villages have gradually disappeared. The practices of feuding, vendettas, and armed conflicts have ceased; a spirit of mutual support and cooperation has emerged. Unprecedentedly new relations of solidarity have emerged among and within various ethnic groups. A fresh, magnificent, and thriving picture is gradually unfolding in the Yunnan border region.

    However, only a few years ago, the situation was quite different. 1.7 million people of the Dai, Hani, Lahu, Tibetan, Achang, and other ethnic groups were oppressed under the great mountain of the feudal lord system. The vast majority of the land was in the hands of feudal lords and landlords, who accounted for only about 2% of the total population, while more than 90% of the working people of all ethnic groups were subjected to official rents, land rents, usury, and numerous other forms of exploitation. Farmers with little or no land accounted for 70% of the rural population. For example, the more than 20,000 square kilometers of land in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture all belonged to the Dai grand feudal lord, the "Zhaopianling," who then sub-divided it among many smaller lords and headmen for actual control. Dai farmers had to "buy land to cultivate, buy water to drink, and buy roads to travel" from the lords, and even had to "buy soil to cover their faces" after death. According to incomplete statistics, before liberation, the exploitation of Dai farmers by lords, landlords, and the Kuomintang reactionary government accounted for 57% of their total income, and they also had to bear various forms of unpaid labor. For example, the corvée labor performed by farmers living near the grand lord Zhaopianling still retained more than 100 types at the beginning of liberation. These villages were named after the types of corvée labor they performed, such as the cook village, water-carrying village, firewood-chopping village, fish-offering village, and chicken-delivery village, which were responsible for cooking for the lord; the bridge-building village, boat-rowing village, sedan-carrying village, horse-raising village, and elephant-raising village, which were responsible for transportation for the lord; the horn-blowing village, firecracker-setting village, gong-beating village, and peacock-tail-carrying village, which were responsible for the lord's ceremonial processions; the song and dance village, which provided entertainment for the lord; the slipper-embroidering village and skirt-holding village, which served the lord's family; and even a murder village. When someone in the lord's family died, there was even a special "mourning village." On one hand, the lords lived a life of extravagance and dissipation, while on the other hand, the vast majority of farmers were treated as cattle and horses by the lords. This cruel and backward feudal lord system stifled the productive enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups and was the root cause of the long-term poverty and backwardness of the minority ethnic groups in the border region.

    With the development of production, the working people of all ethnic groups inevitably demanded the overthrow of this system. Historically, in the Xishuangbanna and Honghe autonomous prefectures, the Dai and Hani people had launched struggles against paying official rents and burning down the Tusi yamen more than once before liberation. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the state, production in these border areas has developed considerably, but it is still greatly constrained by the feudal lord system; the farmers' demands for reform are also becoming increasingly urgent. At the same time, since liberation, the Party has conducted long-term unity, education, and transformation work on the upper echelons of these ethnic groups, enabling many of them to gradually realize that the feudal lord system is indeed an obstacle to the development of their ethnic group and a heavy burden hindering their progress. Therefore, democratic reform is not only an urgent demand of the farmers of all ethnic groups, but also accepted by the majority of the upper echelons of the ethnic groups, becoming the common aspiration of the entire ethnic group.

    Although the conditions for reform were already "ripe," the Party also noted that these ethnic groups had several special circumstances: they lived in border areas close to the national border; historically, there were deep ethnic divisions; and many upper echelons of the ethnic groups had made some contributions to ethnic unity and the struggle against the enemy after liberation. In order to unite the people of all ethnic groups and classes to jointly build the motherland, it was entirely possible to adopt the method of peaceful consultation to carry out democratic reform. From 1955, this work was gradually carried out in the border areas, and it was basically completed by 1956. After the reform, the farmers of all ethnic groups in the border region who had little or no land basically satisfied their requirements for land and means of production, and they were all overjoyed.

    With the end of land reform through peaceful consultation, the people of all ethnic groups in the border region who had newly acquired land and broken free from the shackles of feudalism immediately organized themselves under the leadership of the Party, and with surging enthusiasm, they devoted themselves fully to the all-round development of production. The Dai farmers in the Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture, who had been mercilessly exploited under the feudal lord system in the past, had no desire to fertilize their fields and had developed the backward habit of "people without toilets and livestock without stables." After land reform, they not only built toilets everywhere and turned over the manure piled up by the villages for centuries, but also applied an average of 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu last year. The Hani and other ethnic farmers on the south bank of the Red River, after land reform, were determined to build the Ailao Mountains, which are covered with peaks and forests, into a land of green hills, clear waters, and colorful fish and rice. During the day, the sound of digging canals and chiseling rocks on the water conservancy construction sites was like thunder in spring. At night, the ten thousand lights in the terraced fields resembled the stars in the sky. In Yan Tou, Hapo Township, Yuanyang County, there was a large stream of water that flowed all year round, and it was said that a dragon lived there and could not be disturbed. After land reform, the Hani farmers, who had been liberated, broke the millennium-old superstition and bravely tied ropes around their bodies, hanging on the cliffs to dig canals, and finally diverted the water to irrigate the paddy fields that could produce more than 5,000 shi of grain. On the Zhongdian Plateau, surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Tibetan farmers used to have to perform unpaid labor for the lords and serf owners first before they could cultivate their own land, which often delayed the planting season. At that time, Tibetan people never had time to irrigate the highland barley fields, and more than 60% of the crops were not fertilized or weeded, resulting in an average yield of only 100 to 200 jin of grain per mu. In the first year after the completion of democratic reform, they built more than 100 water conservancy projects, gradually changed backward farming techniques and production tools, and as a result, grain production increased by 35%, averaging more than 760 jin per person.

    消灭封建制度　发展集体生产
    边疆人民生活欣欣向荣
    本报讯　云南边疆过去长期处于封建社会的一百七十万少数民族，经过和平协商完成土地改革后，迅速走上了进步繁荣的康庄大道。
    在边疆完成土地改革后的第一年——1957年，生产就有很大发展，粮食普遍增产了10％到15％，建立了二千零七十七个农业社，入社农户占农户总数的21.9％，农业社增产20％到30％，其中部分社增产一倍以上。1958年，边疆的生产和合作化运动又同时发展，互相促进，粮食比1957年增产了五成左右，平均每人粮食产量达到千斤，合作社也发展到六千三百七十九个。今年，边疆掀起了继续大跃进的生产高潮。边疆的夏季作物已获得大丰收，红河南岸金平、元阳、红河等县哈尼族农民第一次大量种植小麦，就获得亩产四百斤的辉煌成就。同时，边疆地区基本实现了合作化，其中一部分地区建立了人民公社。随着封建制度的消灭和集体生产的发展，历史上遗留下来的各民族、地区、村寨之间的隔阂逐渐消失。打冤家、仇杀、械斗的风气停止了；互相支援协作的风气兴起了。各民族之间和民族内部出现了空前团结的新关系。一幅新鲜、瑰丽、欣欣向荣的图画逐渐在云南边疆展现。
    而在几年以前，却是另外一种情景。一百七十万傣、哈尼、拉祜、藏、阿昌等族人民被压在封建领主制度的大山之下，绝大部分土地掌握在占总人口2％左右的封建领主和地主手中，占人口90％以上的各族劳动人民受到官租、地租、高利贷和名目繁多的剥削，无田少地的农民占农村人口70％。如西双版纳傣族自治州二万多平方公里的土地都属于傣族大领主“召片领”所有，他又分封给许多小领主和头人实际掌握。傣族农民要向领主“买地种、买水喝、买路走”，甚至死后还要向领主“买土盖脸”。据不完全统计，傣族农民在解放前受领主、地主和国民党反动政府的剥削占总收入的57％，还要担负各种各样的无偿劳役。如住在大领主召片领附近的农民为领主服的劳役，在解放初期还保留一百多种。这些村寨都以担负的劳役种类命名，有为领主担任炊事的厨役寨、挑水寨、砍柴寨、献鱼寨、送鸡寨；有为领主作交通的搭桥寨、划船寨、抬轿寨、养马寨、养象寨；有为领主出门作仪仗的吹号寨、放炮寨、敲锣寨、抬孔雀尾寨；有供领主娱乐的歌舞寨；有服侍领主家属的提绣鞋寨、提裙寨；有杀人寨，甚至领主家死了人，还有一个专门的“哭丧寨”。一方面是领主穷奢极欲的生活，一方面是广大农民被领主当作牛马。这种残酷、落后的封建领主制度束缚了各族农民的生产积极性，是边疆少数民族长期贫困落后的根源。
    随着生产的发展，各族劳动人民必然要求推翻这种制度。在历史上，在西双版纳和红河等自治州内，傣族和哈尼族人民在解放前不止一次地爆发过抗交官租、烧毁土司衙门等斗争。解放后，在党的领导和国家帮助下，这些边疆地区的生产虽有不小发展，但仍受着封建领主制度的很大束缚；农民要求改革也日益迫切。同时，党在解放后对这些民族的上层人士进行了长期的团结教育改造工作，使得许多民族上层人士逐步认识到封建领主制度确是本民族发展的障碍，也是阻碍他们进步的沉重包袱。于是民主改革不但是各族农民的迫切要求，也为大多数民族上层人士接受，成了整个民族的共同愿望。
    改革的条件虽已“瓜熟蒂落”，但是，党也注意到这些民族存在若干特殊情况，居住边疆，紧靠国界，主要是历史上的民族隔阂较深，不少民族的上层人士解放后在民族团结和对敌斗争等工作中有过一些贡献。为了团结各族各阶层人民共同建设祖国，完全可能采用和平协商方式进行民主改革。从1955年起，这一工作陆续在边疆地区展开，到1956年就基本完成。经过改革，边疆无田少地的农民基本上满足了土地和生产资料的要求，莫不欢欣鼓舞。
    和平协商土地改革结束，新分得土地和挣断了封建枷锁的边疆各族人民，立即在党的领导下组织起来，以澎湃的热情全力全面发展生产。西双版纳自治州的傣族农民，过去在封建领主制度的残酷压榨下，无心对田地施肥，养成了“人无厕所，牲畜无厩”的落后习惯，土地改革后不但普遍盖了厕所，把几百年来堆在寨边的粪土都翻了身，去年平均每亩施肥五千斤。红河南岸的哈尼等族农民在土地改革以后，立志要把群峰密布的哀牢山区建设成青山绿水、万紫千红的鱼米之乡。白天，水利工地上开渠凿石的声音有如春雷轰鸣，入夜，梯田里的万盏灯火仿佛天空繁星。元阳县哈播乡的岩头上有股长年大流水，相传有龙居住，不能触犯。土地改革后，翻了身的哈尼族农民打破千年迷信，勇敢地用绳绑住身体，吊在悬崖上开凿水渠，终于把这股水引来灌溉了可产五千多石谷子的水田。在雪山环抱的中甸高原上，过去藏族农民要首先为领主和农奴主服无偿的劳役，才能耕种自己的土地，因此往往延误了耕种节令。那时藏民从来没有时间给青稞地灌溉，60％以上的庄稼不施肥，不锄草，平均每亩地才产一两百斤粮食。完成民主改革后第一年，他们就修了一百多项水利工程，逐步改变了落后的耕作技术和生产工具，结果粮食增产了35％，平均每人达到七百六十多斤。（附图片）
