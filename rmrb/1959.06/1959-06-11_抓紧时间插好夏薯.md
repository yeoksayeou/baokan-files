Seize the Time to Plant Summer Sweet Potatoes Well
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Sweet Potato Research Institute
    Summer sweet potatoes account for more than 75% of the total sweet potato cultivation area in our country throughout the year. In some areas, only summer sweet potatoes are planted, not spring sweet potatoes. Therefore, planting summer sweet potatoes well is of decisive significance for ensuring a good sweet potato harvest. The Grain in Ear solar term has passed, and summer sweet potatoes are about to begin planting.

    Cultivate Strong Seedlings to Ensure Early Planting
    Timely early planting is the primary key to increasing sweet potato production. To plant early, there must be enough seedlings. Therefore, the most important task in summer sweet potato planting is to focus on seedling cultivation. To obtain more seedlings in a short time, the following points need to be mastered:
    (1) Water frequently and topdress frequently. In summer, the sunlight is strong and the temperature is high, and transpiration and evaporation from the leaves and the ground are very vigorous. The amount of watering must be increased in the seedbed to ensure the supply of water. Seedbeds should be watered in the morning and evening. At noon, the temperature is high and transpiration is strong. Watering will lower the soil temperature and weaken the water absorption capacity of the roots, forming leaf collapse. The amount of watering should be sufficient to soak the seedbed soil, and the soil should be kept moist (equivalent to 60%-70% of the maximum water holding capacity) without dry soil clods on the surface. Watering should be done one day after cutting the seedlings to prevent germs from entering the seedlings through the wounds and causing rot.
    Generally, seedlings are cut more than three times in warm beds or heated pits. In open field seedbeds, the seedlings are already more than a foot high. Therefore, the nutrients in the mother sweet potatoes are no longer sufficient for the growth of the seedlings and topdressing must be done in the seedbed. Nitrogen has the effect of strengthening the top extension of the seedlings and promoting branching, so fertilizers with high nitrogen content should be applied to the seedbed. The experience of Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, proves that applying 50 jin of diluted, decomposed human manure (one part human manure mixed with three parts water), or 6-8 liang of ammonium sulfate, every five to seven days to a 40-square-meter seedbed has a significant effect on promoting seedling growth. The effect is even better if these two fertilizers are applied alternately. When selecting fertilizers, attention should be paid to appropriate acidity and alkalinity. For example, human manure is alkaline and should not be used too much in seedbeds with high alkalinity. Any fertilizer must be rinsed with water immediately after application to avoid burning the stems and leaves. Topdressing should also be carried out one day after cutting the seedlings.
    (2) Loosen the soil and mound the roots. Loosening the soil is beneficial for preserving moisture and increasing soil ventilation, which is beneficial to the growth of seedlings. Watering easily causes the seedbed soil to harden, so as the number of waterings increases, the number of soil loosenings should also increase.
    After the seedlings emerge from the soil, the soil should be gradually mounded up to about two inches from the base of the seedlings. This will allow the part of the base that is buried in the soil to grow many roots to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, promoting faster and stronger seedling growth. Mounding the roots can also save seedlings whose bases have rotted due to black spot disease.
    (3) Short-term covering and shading. Although sweet potatoes are thermophilic plants, the growth rate actually decreases when the temperature rises above 38 degrees Celsius. Practice in Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, in 1958 proved that on sunny days after May, erecting a shed to shade the seedbed from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm, so that the seedlings only see weak light and are not directly exposed to the sun, the growth rate of the seedlings is obviously much faster than that of seedlings without a shed. However, one to two days before cutting the seedlings, the seedlings can no longer be covered so they can be toughened up by sunlight.
    (4) Cut seedlings frequently. In warm beds or heated pits, because the seed potatoes are planted densely and the seedlings grow crowded, when the seedlings grow to a sufficient length for planting (six inches to one foot, depending on the variety and local habits), they should be cut off in time. Otherwise, the lower stems and leaves will turn yellow or even rot, and the growth of the later seedlings will be hindered, affecting the yield and quality of the seedlings.
    Seedlings cut from warm beds or heated pits can be transplanted into a nursery for temporary planting (if the time is longer, it can also play the role of propagating seedlings from seedlings). Seedlings that have been temporarily planted are also toughened up, which can increase yield. The results of experiments by the Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences show that seedlings that have been temporarily planted can increase yield by up to 18.2% compared to seedlings that have not been temporarily planted. However, after the temporarily planted seedlings are pulled up, the roots must be cut off before replanting.
    On the basis of cultivating sufficient seedlings, there are conditions to select strong seedlings for planting. The quality of seedlings varies significantly due to seedling cultivation techniques, the position of the seedlings, pests and diseases, and the degradation of the species. Experiments by the former North China Academy of Agricultural Sciences showed that seedlings from the tip and middle parts increased production by 17.2%-20.3% compared to seedlings from the base; seedlings with toxin disease generally reduced production by 20%, with a maximum reduction of 60%; experiments by the Chinese Academy of Sciences proved that the Shengli No. 100 variety has developed a long-vine degradation type, which has longer and thinner internodes than the normal type and reduces production by more than 15.9%. Therefore, seedlings must be selected to eliminate the inferior and retain the superior. The criteria for selecting seedlings are: having the characteristics of the variety, being strong, having compact internodes, and being brightly colored without signs of disease. In areas with sufficient seedlings, seedlings from the tip and middle parts can be used, and seedlings from the base should not be used.

    Apply Sufficient Base Fertilizer
    Because summer sweet potatoes have a relatively short growing period and form tubers early, they need sufficient base fertilizer. A large amount of coarse fertilizer should be spread before plowing, and fine fertilizer should be applied in a concentrated manner to give full play to the fertilizer effect. The results of experiments at the Suixi Farm in Anhui Province show that, under the standard of applying 2,000 jin of miscellaneous fertilizer per mu, strip application increased production by 33% compared to broadcast application. If a large amount of fine fertilizer is used, it can be applied in layers during plowing and mixed with the soil; if a small amount is used, it can be applied in one layer or in holes and mixed with the soil.

    Rational Close Planting to Ensure Full Stand
    Rational close planting includes a reasonable number of plants per unit area, the use of reasonable planting methods and planting techniques.
    The number of plants per mu should be determined according to the cultivation conditions. Generally, barren land should be planted more densely, and fertile land should be planted more sparsely; areas with a short growing period should be planted more densely, and areas with a long growing period should be planted more sparsely; arid areas should be planted more densely, and rainy areas should be planted more sparsely.
    Regarding planting methods, practice in many places in 1958 proved that high-ridge double-row planting has a significant yield-increasing effect. High-ridge is a method created by the masses in Huaibei area and Fujian, and its height and width are larger than ordinary ridges (about eight inches to one foot high, and the base of the ridge is about two feet eight inches to three feet wide). This high-ridge is both beneficial for drainage and moisture retention. On the basis of using this high-ridge, double rows are planted alternately on each ridge, which takes into account close planting. Also, because the ridge edge has better ventilation, it is also suitable for the air-loving characteristics of sweet potato tubers. When determining the height and width of the ridge, the following principles should be followed: in rainy and poorly drained soils, the ridge should be higher and not too wide; in arid and poorly water-retaining soils or slopes, the ridge should be wider and not too high.
    Regarding planting techniques, horizontal planting is better. The results of experiments by the Suqian Sweet Potato Research Institute show that horizontal planting increases production by 11.3% compared to direct planting; the Pingyang Machang in Zhejiang increased production by 30% with horizontal planting compared to oblique planting; horizontal planting is actually also a close planting measure. Because more nodes are inserted into the soil, and at the same time, each node is in a shallower soil layer, the number of tubers per plant increases. When carrying out horizontal planting, the following must be grasped: the seedlings should be placed flat, the planting depth should not exceed two inches, and each node should be pressed tightly to ensure close contact with the soil.
    In addition, replanting sweet potato seedlings often does not produce tubers or only produces small tubers, so ensuring a full stand is a prerequisite for obtaining a high yield. The survival rate of seedlings is closely related to the quality of the seedlings, planting techniques, and pest and disease control measures. Therefore, on the basis of selecting strong seedlings, attention must also be paid to planting techniques and doing a good job in pest and disease control (especially underground insects).
    When cutting and planting summer sweet potatoes, it is often the dry season in many places, so plowing, ridging, and planting should be done simultaneously to improve the survival rate of seedlings. However, with deep plowing and layered fertilization, moisture loss is still inevitable, so watering must be done after planting.
    In areas where underground insects such as wireworms and grubs are serious, poisonous soil or poisonous grain should be applied when making ridges. In areas where pests such as small weevils, cutworms, and mole crickets are serious, poisonous bait should be scattered before and after planting to attract and kill them.

    抓紧时间插好夏薯
    中国农业科学院甘薯研究所
    我国夏薯占全年甘薯栽培面积的75％以上，某些地区甚至只栽夏薯，不栽春薯，因此栽好夏薯对保证甘薯丰收具有决定性意义。芒种节令已过，夏薯即将开始栽插。培育壮苗　保证早栽
    及时早栽是甘薯增产的首要关键，要早栽必须有足够的薯苗，所以在夏薯栽插工作中，最重要的工作是抓育苗。要在很短的时间内得到较多的薯苗，需要掌握以下几点：
    （1）勤浇水，勤追肥。夏季日光强、温度高，叶面和地面的蒸腾和蒸发作用都很旺盛，必须在苗床中增加浇水量，才能保证水分的供应。苗床浇水时间，应在早晚进行，中午温度高，蒸腾作用强，浇水会降低土温，削弱根部吸水能力，形成塌叶的现象。浇水量以使床土湿透为度，并经常保持床土呈湿漉漉的状态
  （相当于最大持水力的60％—70％），土面不结干土块。剪苗以后应过一天再浇水，以防病菌随水由创口侵入薯苗引起腐烂。
    现在温床或火炕中一般剪苗都达三次以上，露地苗床中苗高的已达一尺以上，因此母薯中的养分已不敷薯苗生长之用，必须在苗床中追肥。氮素有加强薯苗顶端伸展和促进分枝的作用，所以苗床中应追施含氮量高的肥料。江苏宿迁县的经验证明，四十平方公尺的苗床，每五至七天追施腐熟的稀薄人粪尿五十斤（一份人粪尿兑三份水），或硫酸铵六至八两，对促进薯苗生长有显著效果，这两种肥料交替追施效果更好。在选择肥料时应注意酸碱度适当，如人粪尿是碱性的，在碱性大的苗床中不宜过多施用。任何肥料施用后都必须立即用水淋洗一次，以免灼伤茎叶。追肥也须在剪苗后一天进行。
    （2）松土壅根。松土有利保墒和增加土壤通气，对薯苗生长是有利的。浇水后容易引起床土板结，所以随着浇水次数的增加，松土次数也应增加。
    薯苗出土以后，应自苗的基部逐渐培厚至二寸左右，这样基部入土部分就可以生出很多根吸收土壤中的水分和养分，促进薯苗生长更快、更壮。壅根还可以使因黑斑病而基部发生腐烂的薯苗得到挽救。
    （3）短时复盖遮阴。甘薯虽然是喜温植物，但是温度升高到摄氏三十八度以上时，生长速度反而下降。1958年江苏丰县实践证明，5月份以后的晴天，从上午十时到下午三时，在苗床上搭篷遮阴，使薯苗只见弱光，不受太阳直接暴晒，薯苗生长速度显然比不搭篷的快得多。但在剪苗前一至两天，可不再复盖薯苗，使受到阳光锻炼。
    （4）勤剪薯苗。在温床或火炕中，由于种薯排得密，苗长得挤，所以薯苗生长够栽插长度时（六寸至一尺，因品种和各地习惯而不同），就应该及时剪下，否则就会使下部茎叶发黄，甚至腐烂，并且妨碍后发出的小苗生长，影响出苗量和苗的品质。
    从温床或火炕中剪下的苗，可以栽到苗圃中假植（如果时间长些的，还可以起到以苗繁殖苗的作用），薯苗经假植后还起到锻炼作用，能提高产量。福建农业科学研究所试验结果，经过假植的薯苗比未经假植的薯苗最高能增产18.2％。但假植的苗经拔起后，必须把生根的部分剪掉再栽插。
    在培育足够薯苗的基础上，就有条件选用壮苗栽插。薯苗的品质因育苗技术、苗的部位、病虫害以及种性的退化等，有显著的差异，前华北农业科学研究所试验，梢部和中部苗分别比基部苗增产17.2％—20.3％；毒素病的苗一般减产20％，最高减产60％；中国科学院试验证明，胜利百号品种已发生长蔓退化的类型，这种类型薯苗节间长而细，比正常的类型减产达15.9％以上。因此，薯苗必须经过一番选择才能去劣存优。选苗的标准是：具有本品种特征的，苗壮、节间紧凑的，色泽鲜明没有病征的。在薯苗足够的地区，可选用梢部和中部苗，不用基部苗。
              施足基肥
    由于夏甘薯生长期比较短，结薯较早，需有足够的基肥。大量的粗肥，在翻土前撒施，细肥采取集中施用的办法，可以充分发挥肥效。安徽省濉溪农场试验结果，在每亩施用杂肥二千斤的标准下，条施比撒施的增产33％。细肥施用量较大的，可在翻土时分层施开，与土壤拌匀；施用量不大的，可施一层或穴施，均须与土壤拌匀。
      合理密植　保证全苗
    合理密植，包括单位面积内有合理的株数，采用合理的栽插方式和栽插方法三个内容。
    确定每亩株数时应根据栽培条件而定，一般瘦地宜较密，肥地宜较稀；生长期短的宜较密，生长期长的宜较稀；干旱地区宜较密，多雨地区宜较稀。
    关于栽插方式，1958年很多地方实践证明：高垅双行栽插有显著增产效果。高垅是淮北地区和福建群众创造出来的一种办法，它的高度和宽度都比一般垅大（高约八寸至一尺，垅基宽约二尺八寸至三尺），采用这种高垅既利排涝又利保墒。在采用这种高垅的基础上，每垅交错栽插双行，既照顾了密植，又由于垅边通气性较好，所以也适合薯块欢喜空气的特性。确定垅的高度和宽度时，应按照以下原则：多雨及排水不良的土壤，垅宜较高，不宜过宽；干旱及保水力差的土壤或坡地，垅宜较宽，不宜过高。
    关于栽插方法，以水平插较好。宿迁甘薯研究所试验结果，水平插比直插增产11.3％；浙江平阳马场用水平插比斜插增产30％；水平插实际也是一种密植措施，由于插入土中节数较多，同时各节都在较浅的土层，所以每株结薯数增加。在进行水平插时，必须掌握：薯苗要放平，栽插深度不宜超过两寸，每一节都要按紧，使与土壤密接。
    另外，甘薯补苗常不结薯或只结小薯，因此保证全苗是得到丰产的前提。薯苗成活率与苗的品质，栽插技术，防治病虫害措施等有密切关系，所以在选用壮苗的基础上，还必须注意栽插技术和做好病虫害（特别是地下虫）防治工作。
    扦插夏薯时，在很多地方正是干旱季节，所以应该边翻土，边做垅，边栽插，这样可以提高薯苗成活率。但随着深翻土和分层施肥，跑墒仍然是免不了的，所以在栽插后必须浇水。
    在金针虫、蛴螬等地下虫严重地区，做垅子时，应施毒土或毒谷。小象鼻虫、地老虎、蝼蛄等害虫严重地区，栽插前后应撒毒饵诱杀。
