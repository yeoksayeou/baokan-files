The Shanghai Paper Industry Sets a Red Flag
Producing Good Paper Without Good Raw Materials

    (Our report) Shanghai is one of China's current paper industry bases. After September of last year, when the supply of raw materials was insufficient, the workers put forward the slogan of "Fighting for Raw Materials," launching a mass movement to open up sources of raw materials. As a result, the use of wood pulp, reed pulp, and bamboo pulp was reduced by 43%, while production increased by 17%, overfulfilling the annual leap forward plan. Since the beginning of this year, in order to achieve another great leap forward in terms of output, quality, and variety, the mass movement to find and save raw materials has been vigorously carried out by Shanghai paper workers. In the first quarter, the usage of both fiber raw materials and chemical raw materials was greatly reduced compared to the same period last year, but paper production increased by 10,000 tons, overfulfilling the quarterly plan.

    Making every effort to utilize urban waste materials is the first important experience of Shanghai's paper-making workers. They have collected a large amount of waste paper, rags, waste wood chips, waste bamboo chips, waste cotton, cotton stalks, etc., as fiber raw materials. The waste rags and waste paper collected in the first quarter alone can produce enough paper to print more than 800 million newspapers (one large sheet each). Many workers personally mobilized relatives and neighbors to sell waste paper and rags to the factory as raw materials. At the Jiangnan Paper Mill, six tons of waste paper were collected at one time. The father of one worker, a retired worker from the tram company, heard that the paper mill was collecting waste paper, so he went to the tram company to get ticket stubs to supply to the paper mill. The workers also posted posters on the streets to collect raw materials and showed slide promotional films in cinemas to promote the establishment of recycling stations by residents' committees, establish recycling networks, and, with the support of relevant units, set up waste paper expansion recycling teams to carry out waste paper recycling publicity to government agencies, organizations, schools, and enterprises.

    The workers also came up with a way to find alkali from steel slag. Now thirteen paper mills have established contact with all steel mills in Shanghai. In the first quarter, 500 tons of 30-degree liquid alkali were extracted from steel slag. Workers at the Daming Paper Mill used the waste from chemical plants—neutral sodium sulfite—to steam grass, and the quality of the pulp was very good. Workers at the Lihua Paper Mill used a reverberatory furnace to burn yellow mud instead of talc, producing very good packaging paper. The Huali Paper Mill produces copperplate paper. Due to the lack of casein, the workers used oxidized starch instead, with good results, saving more than one million yuan a year.

    Vigorously developing native grass pulp is another important method researched by the workers. Native grass pulp is rice straw pulp made using native methods. Originally, some factories in Shanghai were not accustomed to using this native grass pulp, but in the vigorous movement to excavate raw materials, developing native grass pulp became a trend. Many paper mills have established contact with people's communes. Workers assisted people's communes in establishing native grass pulp strongholds in terms of technology and equipment. They established 87 such strongholds in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces and in the counties under the jurisdiction of Shanghai. The Jiaxing Prefecture of Zhejiang Province has 37 strongholds that have cooperative relations with 11 paper mills in Shanghai. In January of this year, 3,000 tons of native grass pulp were supplied to Shanghai.

    The workers are also engaging in technical revolution, tapping potential, finding substitutes, and reducing consumption quotas. Many paper mills are making their own paper pulp in order to increase production. The Tianzhang Paper Mill originally used wood pulp and reed pulp as raw materials for making high-grade paper. Now the workers are trying to use grass pulp instead. Their slogan is, "Making good paper with bad materials." They have successively tested more than a dozen types of grass, including "weaving machine grass" from Inner Mongolia, Ula grass from Jilin, silk grass from Chongming County, and cogongrass from the suburbs of Shanghai, proving that grass pulp can replace wood pulp in the manufacture of high-grade paper. Not long ago, the workers also experimented with using Zhejiang mulberry stalks and Guizhou dawa hemp to make pulp.

    The workers have also created many experiences in reducing consumption quotas. Many factories use enhanced recycling to save raw materials. Waste pulp lost in the drainage ditches is also recovered with recovery devices. There is a lot of fiber in the ash under the cloth-cutting machine, which used to be discarded as waste, but is now recovered and used as raw material.

    Some paper mills also produce their own raw materials such as caustic soda, soda ash, and copper wire mesh. An electrolytic salt workshop has been established in the Da Zhonghua Paper Mill. Currently, eighteen electrolytic cells are producing caustic soda every day, and more electrolytic cells will soon be put into production.

    Relevant leadership departments in Shanghai have strengthened their leadership over this work. The Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission has established a special paper-making raw material team. The Paper Company of the Municipal Light Industry Bureau has also put a lot of effort into carrying out a series of organizational work. (Attached picture)

### 上海造纸工业竖起一面红旗  不用好原料　也产好纸张

    上海造纸工业竖起一面红旗
    不用好原料　也产好纸张
    本报讯　上海是我国目前的造纸工业基地之一。去年9月以后，职工们在原料供应不足的情况下，提出了为原料而战的口号，掀起了一个群众性的开辟原料来源的运动。结果少用了43％的木浆、苇浆、竹浆，产量却提高了17％，超额完成了全年跃进计划。今年以来，上海造纸工人为了在产量、质量、品种等方面再来一个大跃进，寻找和节约原料的群众运动又轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。在第一季度中，不论在纤维原料方面，或在化工原料方面，都比去年同期大大减少了使用量，但纸的产量却增加了一万吨，超额完成了季度计划。
    千方百计利用城市废料，是上海造纸职工们的第一条重要经验。他们收集了大量废纸、破布、废木片、废竹片、废棉花、棉秆等等，作为纤维原料。仅第一季度中收集的破布和破纸，就可以生产可印八亿多份报纸（一份一大张）的纸张来。很多职工亲自动员亲戚、邻居将废纸、破布卖给厂里做原料。在江南造纸厂，一次就收集到六吨废纸。有一个工人的父亲是电车公司退休工人，听说造纸厂收集废纸，就跑到电车公司把票根拿来，供应造纸厂。职工们还在街头张贴收集原料的宣传画，在电影院放映幻灯宣传片，推动居民委员会创立民办回收站，建立回收网，又在有关单位的支援下，成立废纸扩大回收小组，向机关、团体、学校、企业开展了回收废纸的宣传。
    工人们还想出了从钢渣中找碱的办法。现在已有十三个造纸厂和上海所有的炼钢厂建立了联系，在第一季度，从钢渣中提取的三十度液碱就有五百吨。大明造纸厂职工把化工厂的下脚——中性亚硫酸钠用来蒸草，浆的质量很好。利华造纸厂职工利用反射炉烧黄泥，代替滑石粉，生产出很好的包装纸。华丽造纸厂生产铜版纸，由于缺少干酪素，职工们就用氧化淀粉代替，效果很好，一年可以节约一百多万元。
    大搞土草浆，是职工们研究出来的另一个重要办法。土草浆就是用土法制造的稻草浆。原先上海有些厂不习惯于使用这种土草浆，在轰轰烈烈的挖掘原材料的运动中，搞土草浆形成了风气。很多造纸厂纷纷和人民公社建立了联系。职工们在技术上和设备上协助人民公社建立土草浆据点。他们在浙江、江苏两省和上海市属各县建立的这种据点就有八十七个。浙江省嘉兴专区有三十七个据点和上海十一个造纸厂有协作关系，今年1月份供应上海的土草浆就有三千吨。
    工人们还大闹技术革命，挖潜力，找代用品，降低消耗定额。许多造纸厂为了增产，自己造纸浆。天章造纸厂造高级纸的原料原来用木浆和苇浆，现在职工们设法用草浆来代替。他们的口号是，“坏料造好纸”。他们先后试验了来源较多的内蒙古的“织机草”，吉林的乌拉草、崇明县的丝草、上海郊区的荻草等十多种草类，证明草浆可以代替木浆制造高级纸张。不久前，职工们还试验用浙江桑树杆和贵州大哇麻来制浆。
    职工们还创造了很多降低消耗定额的经验。许多工厂用加强回收工作来节约原材料。连阴沟内流失的废浆，也用回收器回收了。切布车下灰内有不少纤维，过去都当废料倒掉，现在也回收起来作原料。
    有些造纸厂还自己搞烧碱、纯碱、铜丝网等原材料的生产。电解食盐车间已在大中华造纸厂建立起来了，现在有十八个电解槽在每天生产着烧碱，不久还将有更多的电解槽投入生产。
    上海市有关的领导部门加强了对这项工作的领导。上海市计划委员会专门成立了造纸原料小组。市轻工业局的造纸公司也以很大力量进行了一系列的组织工作。（附图片）
