Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The vegetables and meat produced by the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lüda have basically achieved self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency.

This year, the agricultural and sideline production of the troops stationed in Lüda is more diverse and the output has greatly exceeded that of previous years. The land they cultivated this year increased by 1.3 times compared to last year; pig farming increased by 1.7 times, and they have achieved self-breeding; more than 115,000 chickens were raised, an increase of more than 16 times compared to last year. They also raised more than 2,400 heads of cattle, sheep, rabbits, etc., and opened many workshops for making tofu, vermicelli, soy sauce, etc. Some units established offshore fishing teams, which have caught more than 714,000 catties of fish from the beginning of the year to now, 190,000 catties more than in the same period last year. Some fishing teams achieved bumper harvests in April, catching more than 50,000 catties of fish each time they went to sea, which not only improved the troops' food but also supplied the market.

This year, the enthusiasm of the troops for agricultural and sideline production is very high, and many units have exceeded their production targets. The spinach planted by a certain unit of the garrison in Lushun yielded 18,000 catties per mu. Among the pigs raised by a certain unit of the garrison in Jin County, seven fat pigs weighed between 800 and 1,200 catties. The sanatorium of a certain unit raised an average of ten chickens per person, more than three times the original target. The garrison troops have opened training classes for veterinarians and epidemic prevention workers, as well as breeders. A certain unit has established two indigenous chlortetracycline feed processing plants, which have played a significant role in strengthening epidemic prevention and reducing poultry mortality.

    解放军驻旅大部队
    基本做到肉食自给
    据新华社讯　解放军驻旅大部队自产的蔬菜和肉类，已基本上自给或半自给。
    今年，驻旅大部队的农副业生产花样多，产量大大超过了往年。他们今年耕种的土地比去年增加了一点三倍；养猪增加了一点七倍，并做到了自繁自养；养鸡一十一万五千多只，比去年增加了十六倍多。他们还饲养有二千四百多头牛、羊、兔等，开办了许多制作豆腐、粉条、酱油等的作坊。有些部队建立了海上捕鱼队，从年初到现在共已捕鱼七十一万四千多斤，比去年同期多捕了十九万斤。有的捕鱼队4月份连获丰收，每次出海都捕鱼五万斤以上，不仅改善了部队的伙食，还供应了市场。
    今年各部队从事农副业生产的情绪很高，许多部队都超过了生产指标。旅顺驻军某部种植的菠菜亩产达一万八千斤。金县驻军某部养的猪中，有七头肥猪重量达到八百斤到一千二百斤。某部疗养院平均每人养鸡十只，超过原来指标三倍多。驻军部队开办了兽医防疫员与饲养员训练班，某部建立了两座土制金霉素饲料加工厂，这些对加强防疫，减少家禽死亡起了很大作用。
