    East Side of Taihu Lake
    Lu Xiangtao
    Just as dawn broke, we boarded a car and set off for Pingwang on the shore of Taihu Lake. The morning breeze gently brushed against us, stirring the cool, moist mist, and the morning sun shone down, instantly scattering golden light across the boundless green fields. All we could hear was the gurgling of water and the resounding croaking of frogs. We had entered a poetic realm – the water towns of Suzhou.
    Suzhou is an ancient water network area. As early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, there was already a considerable scale of ditches and river networks here. During the Tang Dynasty, thousands of "dredging troops" were stationed year-round, specializing in repairing canals, opening rivers, dredging and building dikes, and connecting land and lakes. However, due to the limitations of social conditions in ancient times, the water network system was disorganized and fragmented: the main rivers were small, the polders were thin, and the water systems were messy, with a net but no main rope, like a tangled mess. To make matters worse, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the bureaucratic warlords regarded Suzhou as a "lucrative post" to be sold off, but no one who took charge of this place cared about water conservancy construction. Over the years, river ports silted up, culverts and sluices were in disrepair, and dikes broke and polders collapsed, making it impossible to defend against floods. Heavy rains led to major floods, and light rains led to minor floods, with continuous rain causing internal flooding. In 1949, on the eve of liberation, there was a total collapse of rivers, ports, polders, and sea dikes, large areas of farmland were submerged, and thousands of people were drowned.
    Now that we've arrived here, we no longer see that desolate scene of the past. River courses have been widened, polders have been universally thickened, and floodgates and culverts have been built everywhere; rivers and canals are arranged in vertical and horizontal rows, and the water system is clear. From 1950 to 1958, the Party and the government mobilized the local masses to move 800 million cubic meters of earth and build more than 60,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, greatly reducing drought and flood disasters. 1957 was a year of great floods, but not a single dike broke, and only a small amount of farmland suffered reduced yields due to waterlogging. Since the establishment of the People's Communes, the land management of the small-scale peasant economy of the past has been completely broken, and the combination of polders has been implemented, with polders connected to each other and canals connected to each other. The quiet canal water flows into the fields, bringing a comfortable life to the people on 15 million mu of fertile paddy fields. Today, Suzhou is truly paradise!
    The car sped along the Su (zhou)-Jia (xing) Highway, and after about two hours, we arrived at Pingwang Town.
    This is a lakeside town, and the frontline headquarters for governing Taihu Lake is located here. Pingwang is surrounded by water, with rivers, lakes, and ponds everywhere. Small boats travel through the heart of the town, and fish ponds are scattered throughout the town's outskirts. Patches of verdant paddy fields are scattered among the lakes, like green oases in a vast expanse of blue waves. This area is rich in rice and has large-scale fish farms, earning it the reputation of a "land of fish and rice." The only shortcoming is that the disaster of waterlogging has not been completely eradicated here; however, with the governance of Taihu Lake, this is no longer a problem.
    We took the opportunity to ride in a small motorboat with comrades from the Taipu River Engineering Command to inspect the construction site from Yingbo Lake to the Taipu Sluice construction site.
    The Taipu River is the largest canal project in southern Jiangsu that started this spring. It will connect nineteen large and small lakes and ponds, creating a new river channel 57 kilometers long on flat ground, diverting part of the floodwater from Taihu Lake to the Huangpu River, thereby relieving the threat of internal flooding in the vast area east of Pingwang.
    The motorboat forged ahead on the North Grass Lake. The songs of silkworm-picking girls floated along the banks of the lake:
    Silkworm-picking girls are happy at heart,
    Baskets full of mulberry leaves, baskets full of songs;
    Taihu Lake has built a new river course,
    Songs and laughter fly across the river…
    Boats come and go constantly on the lake, including wooden boats for collecting fertilizer and motorboats for pumping water to irrigate fields, forming a large group, like fishing boats going out to sea. Pumping boat is a unique water lifting equipment in southern Jiangsu, and people call it a "mobile pumping station." Whenever the rice fields are short of water, the pumping boats come from the lake and pump the water up to the rice fields several meters high until they are full. This year, the Suzhou area has also built a large number of electric pumping stations, and it is planned that 80% of the rice fields will use mechanical and electric irrigation by this autumn. It seems that the mechanization and electrification of agricultural production is not a distant matter here.
    The motorboat passed the Ant Lake, and we arrived at Shijiagang. We only saw red flags covering the sky, and the arches facing the sun; on the towering scaffolding, cars and people came and went, and the workers were carrying out high-altitude operations - pouring the sluice piers of the floodgate.
    The Taipu Sluice is built at the mouth of East Taihu Lake and is the hub and throat of the Taipu River. This sluice is 145 meters long and 10 meters high and is the inlet of the Taipu New River. Every flood season, it swallows the floodwater from Taihu Lake, which bursts out of the banks, and flows into the Huangpu River along the wide new river channel. In normal times, the sluice releases lake water to supply irrigation to the farmland along the river.
    The prototype of the Taipu New River can already be seen. After it is completely repaired in the second half of this year, it will make the shipping of Taihu Lake connect in all directions: it can reach Hangzhou to the south and the Yangtze River to the north through the North-South Grand Canal east of Pingwang; further east, it can reach Shanghai via the Huangpu River, and it can enter the vast East China Sea from Liuzhao Port.
    We left the sluice construction site and strolled along the shore of Taihu Lake, seeing white sails dotted on the lake from afar, and hearing the fine drizzle of the ripples beside the dike. The scenery was extremely charming!
    Taihu Lake is located in the triangular area of ​​the Yangtze River and the Qiantang River downstream. Maoshan and Tianmu Mountain shield it to the west, and the east, south, and north sides are surrounded by rivers and seas, with branching ports and sunken terrain, like a golden shimmering large basin.
    The Taihu Lake Basin is one of the largest silkworm areas in my country, and the silk fabrics of Suzhou and Hangzhou are mostly supplied with raw materials from here; Taihu Lake is rich in aquatic products, and the "golden carp" harvested in summer is fat, large and delicious; looking far across the lake, you can see the Dongting Mountain scenic area, which stands in the center of the lake, producing many economic crops such as waxberries, loquats, and tea. The famous tea "Biluochun," which is well-known at home and abroad, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year.
    Today's Taihu Lake is beautiful and rich. However, what is more beautiful and richer is its tomorrow. Listen to the boatmen who are fighting in the heart of the lake and building the long dike across the lake (building a dike in the water for six kilometers), singing about the future of Taihu Lake:
    Hey, Taihu Lake, you listen carefully,
    The people are marching towards you!
    Hey, build a dike across the lake,
    Floods and waterlogging will be separated from our homes!
    Hey, build a flood discharge gate,
    Taihu Lake will have a new look!
    Hey, repair the Taipu River,
    Take a boat to Beijing!

    太湖东畔
    卢向韬
    天刚破晓，我们就坐上汽车往太湖之滨的平望进发。晨风轻拂，吹荡着清凉湿润的薄雾，朝曦照临，顿时在一望无际的绿野上撒满了金光。只听得，流水潺潺，蛙鸣震耳。我们进入了诗一般的境地——苏州水乡。
    苏州是个古老的水网地带，早在春秋战国时代，这里就有了相当规模的沟渠河网；唐代更常年设有数以千计的“撩泄军”，专事修渠开河、疏浚筑堤，沟通陆地与湖泊。不过，由于古时社会条件的限制，水网系统是凌乱分割的：干河小、圩子薄、水系杂乱，有网无纲，有如一团理不清的乱麻。更糟的是国民党反动统治时期，官僚军阀们把苏州看做可鬻的“肥缺”，可是谁来执掌这个地方，也没关心过水利建设。年深日久，河港淤塞，涵闸失修，堤破圩垮，无法防御洪水，大雨大涝，小雨小涝，霪雨内涝。1949年解放前夕，发生了一次江、港、圩堤、海塘总溃决，大片农田被淹没，数千人民被淹死。
    现在来到这里，绝看不到过去那种凄凉景象了。河道已经拓宽，圩堤普遍培厚，到处建起斗门闸涵；河渠纵横成行，水系分明。从1950年到1958年，党和政府发动当地群众做了八亿公方的土方，兴建了小型农田水利工程六万多处，旱涝灾害大大减轻了。1957年是个大水年，可是，寸堤未决，只有很少的农田因涝减产。人民公社成立以来，彻底打破了过去小农经济的土地经营，实行了联圩并圩，圩圩相连，渠渠相通。静静的渠水流进田间，一千五百万亩肥沃的水田，给人民带来丰足的生活。今天，苏州才真正是天堂！
    汽车在苏（州）嘉（兴）公路上飞奔，约两个小时，到了平望镇。
    这是个滨湖小镇，治理太湖的前方司令部就设在这里。平望四周环水，到处是河、湖、荡、漾，小舟穿行街心，鱼塘遍布镇郊。一片片绿茸茸的稻田分散在群湖之间，有如万顷碧波中的绿洲。这里盛产水稻，并有规模巨大的养鱼场，向有“鱼米之乡”的称誉。美中不足的是：这里的涝灾还没根除；不过随着太湖的治理，这已经不是问题了。
    我们趁太浦河工程指挥部的同志到工地视察的机会，同乘小汽艇从鹰泊湖到太浦闸工地去。
    太浦河是今春兴工的苏南最大运河工程，它将串联十九个大小湖荡，平地开成一条长达五十七公里的新河道，分泄太湖一部分洪水到黄浦江去，从而解除平望以东广大地区的内涝威胁。
    汽艇在北草荡上破浪前进。湖荡两岸飘荡着采桑姑娘的歌声：
    采桑姑娘喜心窝，
    满篮桑叶满篮歌；
    太湖修了新河道，
    歌声笑声飞过河。……湖荡里船只往来不断，有捞肥的木船，有抽水灌田的汽船，成群结队，好像出海的鱼舟。抽水机船是苏南特有的提水设备，人们叫它“活动的抽水机站”。每逢稻田缺水时节，抽水机船从湖里跑来，把水抽上几公尺高的稻田，直到喝足为止。今年苏州专区还建设了不少的电力抽水机站，计划到今秋80％的稻田采用机械电力灌溉。看来，农业生产机械化、电气化，在这里不是什么遥远的事情了。
    汽船驶过蚂蚁漾，我们来到了时家港。只见红旗蔽空，采门迎日；在直冲云霄的脚手架上，车来人往，工人们正在进行高空作业——浇筑水闸闸墩。
    太浦闸建筑在东太湖口，是太浦河的枢纽和咽喉。这座闸长一百四十五公尺，高达十公尺，是太浦新河的进水口。每当汛期，它就吞进太湖暴涨泛出的洪水，顺着宽宽的新河道，流入黄浦江。平时，水闸放出湖水，供给沿河的农田灌溉。
    现在已经能看到太浦新河雏形，今年下半年全部修好之后，将使太湖轮船航运四通八达：在平望以东穿南北大运河，可以南达杭州北抵长江；再往东经黄浦江到上海，并可从六灶港进入辽阔的东海。
    我们离开建闸工地，漫游在太湖之滨，遥见湖上白帆点点，近听堤旁微波细雨，景色迷人极了！
    太湖处于长江、钱塘江下游的三角地带，西屏茅山、天目山，东南北三面是江海包围，港汊分歧，地势低陷，有如一面金波荡漾的大盆。
    太湖流域是我国最大的蚕桑区之一，苏杭纺织丝绸多由这里供给原料；太湖水产丰富，夏季丰收的“金鲤”，肥大鲜美；隔湖远眺，可以看到屹立湖心的风景区洞庭山，这里出产杨梅、批杷、茶叶等许多经济作物，著称中外的名茶“碧螺春”，今年获得了空前的丰收。
    今天的太湖是美丽富饶的。但是，更美丽更富饶的是它的明天。你听听战斗在湖心，修筑拦湖长堤（水中筑堤六公里）的船工们，对太湖未来的歌唱吧：
    哎，太湖太湖你听真?，
    人民向你大进军咧！
    嘿，筑起拦湖堤呀，
    洪涝把家分咧！
    嘿，建成泄洪闸呀，
    太湖貌更新咧！
    嘿，修好太浦河呀，
    坐船上北京咧！
