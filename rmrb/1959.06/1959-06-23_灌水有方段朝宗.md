According to the experience of the Fumin People's Commune in Yunnan Province in managing wheat fields, the principle of "less irrigation in the early stage and more irrigation in the later stage" should be followed for watering. Generally, five irrigations are required from sowing to harvest: emergence watering, tillering watering, jointing watering, booting watering, and grain-filling watering. Among these, emergence watering, booting watering, and grain-filling watering are the most important. Because after wheat is sown, it is necessary to maintain a certain amount of moisture to ensure that the seedlings emerge uniformly. During the jointing and booting stages, wheat seedlings grow and develop rapidly, and the weight of the plants increases significantly compared to the early stage, requiring a large amount of water. Moreover, this period coincides with the time around the beginning of spring, when the temperature gradually increases and soil moisture evaporation is greater, requiring replenishment of water. Irrigation during these two periods facilitates the decomposition of fertilizers, allows the roots to spread easily, and facilitates the absorption of nutrients by the wheat seedlings, promoting rapid growth of the seedlings and larger ears; the leaves surrounding the wheat ears also open up easily, making it easier to head. Grain-filling watering has a very good effect on promoting pollination, plump grains, and frost prevention.

The Fumin People's Commune has also implemented irrigation operation procedures, such as irrigating high areas first, then low areas, and irrigating according to soil quality, seedling condition, and weather conditions. Among these, irrigating according to soil quality is the most important. Sandy loam, red soil, sandy chicken manure soil, clayey sand soil, and clayey soil are prone to drying out, and furrow irrigation is advisable. The depth of irrigation should be level with the surface moisture; if it is too deep, the wheat seedlings will turn yellow, and if it is too shallow, the roots will not be able to absorb moisture. For individual soils with high permeability, an additional irrigation of moisturizing furrow water can be added during the grain maturation period to promote plump grains and increase the thousand-grain weight of wheat. Rusty water fields and waterlogged fields should be irrigated appropriately.

    灌水有方段朝宗
    根据云南富民公社小麦田间管理的经验，泡水要掌握“前期少灌，后期多灌”的原则。一般从种到收要灌五次水，就是出苗水、分蘖水、拔节水、催苞水、灌浆水，其中又以出苗水、催苞水、灌浆水最重要。因为小麦下种后，要保持一定的水分，苗才出得齐。拔节孕穗时期，麦苗生长发育很快，植株体重较前期显著增大，需要大量的水分；并且那时正是开春前后，气温逐渐增高，土壤水分蒸发较大，也需要补充水分。在这两个时期灌水，肥料容易分解，根系容易串开，便于麦苗吸收养分，促使苗稞成长快，穗子大；包着麦穗的叶子也散得开，容易抽穗。灌浆水，对促使授粉，籽粒饱满以及防霜都有很好的效果。
    富民公社还推行了灌水操作规程，如先灌高处，后灌低处，看土质、看苗稞、看天气灌水等。其中以看土质灌水最主要。沙壤土、红壤土、夹沙鸡粪土、胶泥夹沙土和胶泥土等土壤容易干燥，采取沟灌为宜。灌水深度要和墒面一样平，太深了麦苗会变黄，太浅了根系吸收不到水分。对个别渗透性较大的土壤，在麦粒成熟期间，可再增灌一道润沟水，促使籽粒饱满，增加小麦千粒重量。锈水田，浸水田应当适当浇灌。
