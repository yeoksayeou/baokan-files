Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 31st. What kind of people are those who initiated the so-called "All-India Tibet Conference" in Calcutta to oppose China and Communism? The Indian "Free Press" published an article on the 30th depicting their faces. The following is a summary of the article.

The People's Socialist Party leader, Kripalani, has been opposing Sino-Indian friendship for the past five or six years. In his opinion, the brilliant Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) is a "sin," "born in sin." He used to be a member of the Congress Party, serving as its chairman and secretary.

The chairman of the "All-India Tibet Conference," Narayan, is a former Congress Party and People's Socialist Party leader. He left politics after Prime Minister Nehru rejected his proposal to form a coalition government and is now the leader of the "Community Development" movement (a movement promoting Gandhism - editor's note). He has left politics, but whenever he goes to Kerala, he always slanders the (Communist-led) state government there. He once frankly said that India should inherit all the rights obtained by British imperialism in Tibet and that India should have a say in the development of the situation in Tibet.

D.P. Ghosh is the chairman of the All-India Landholders' Association, an organization of zemindars (a type of Indian landlord - editor's note) and landlords. When the Dalai Lama was abducted to India, the Mussoorie organization of the All-India Landholders' Association demanded that the Communist Party of India be declared illegal.

Moraes is the former editor of the "Times of India" and the current editor of the "Indian Express." He has close ties to the pro-American "Congress for Cultural Freedom." He enjoys a reputation among certain special figures for writing editorials and articles against China.

The chairman of the preparatory committee of the conference, the "historian" R.C. Majumdar, does not believe that the famous Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 (1857-1859: the great anti-British uprising of the Indian people, who could not bear the oppression of British imperialism; the famous Queen of Jhansi sacrificed herself in this uprising - editor's note) was patriotic. He believes that the leaders of the mutiny were British spies. However, he believes that the rebellion of a few reactionary lamas and landlords in Tibet was a "national uprising."

R. Mukerjee was a prominent worker in the "National War Front," an Indian organization funded by the British during World War II. He is now a trade union leader and the president of a college opened in Calcutta by the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," which is funded by the United States. He is also the chief writer of a newspaper founded under the patronage of a wealthy businessman in Bengal.

### 丑人演丑剧  “全印西藏会议”主角的脸谱

    丑人演丑剧
    “全印西藏会议”主角的脸谱
    新华社新德里31日电　在加尔各答发起所谓“全印西藏会议”来反华反共的是一些什么人物？印度
  “自由报”在30日曾经发表一篇文章描画了他们的脸谱。以下是这篇文章的摘要。
    人民社会党领导人克里帕拉尼在最近五、六年来一直反对印中友好。在他看来，光辉灿烂的潘查希拉（和平共处五项原则）是一种“罪恶”，是“在罪恶中产生的”。他曾经参加过国大党，担任过国大党的主席和书记。
      “全印西藏会议”的主席纳拉扬是前国大党和人民社会党领袖。在尼赫鲁总理拒绝了他提出的组织联合政府的建议以后脱离政界，现在是“共同繁荣”运动（一种宣传甘地主义的运动——编者注）的领袖。他离开了政界，但是每当他到喀拉拉邦去的时候，他总是要中伤那里的（共产党领导的）邦政府。他曾经坦率地说，印度应当继承英帝国主义在西藏取得的全部权利，印度对西藏事态的发展应当有发言权。
    德·普·高希是柴明达（印度的一种地主——编者注）和地主的组织印度人民同盟的主席。当达赖喇嘛被劫持到印度的时候，印度人民同盟穆索里组织要求宣布印度共产党为非法。
    莫雷斯是前“印度时报”和现任“印度快报”的主编。他和亲美的“文化自由协会”有密切的联系。他以撰写反对中国的社论和文章而在某些特殊人物当中享有声誉。
    会议的筹备委员会主席、“历史学家”拉·钱·马朱达并不认为有名的1857年的兵变（1857—1859年印度人民不堪英帝国主义的压迫，举行了反英大起义，著名的詹西女王就是在这次起义中牺牲的——编者注）是爱国的。他认为这次兵变的领导者是英国的间谍。但是，他却认为西藏少数反动喇嘛和地主的叛乱是“民族起义”。
    拉·慕克吉在第二次世界大战期间是一个由英国提供经费的印度组织“全国战争阵线”的突出的工作人员。现在他是一个工会的领导人，并且是由美国提供经费的“国际自由工会联合会”在加尔各答开办的学院的院长。他还是在孟加拉邦的一个大富豪的赞助下开办的一家报纸的主笔。
