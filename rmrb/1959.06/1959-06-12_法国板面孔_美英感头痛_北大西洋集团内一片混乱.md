France's Stern Face Gives U.S. and Britain Headaches
North Atlantic Group in Chaos

    (Reported by this newspaper) The dispute caused by the De Gaulle government's refusal to allow the United States to store nuclear weapons on French territory continues to escalate. This action by France, like a bomb, has once again caused chaos and shock within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.

    The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France suddenly held an "emergency meeting" in Geneva on the 9th to discuss the "urgent issue of storing nuclear weapons in France." Western news agencies pointed out that "Western unity" has "suddenly broken down," and this occurred when Western foreign ministers were eager to piece together a "united front" to deal with the Geneva talks, which could not but have "serious implications."

    Washington government officials are extremely concerned about the uncompromising attitude of the French government. According to a report by UPI, the United States fears that this action by France will cause "the biggest chaos" in the North Atlantic Alliance since March of this year. For six years, France's refusal to allow the United States to store nuclear weapons on its soil has already greatly hindered the "alliance's supply system and tactical flexibility to ensure the use of atomic weapons." Therefore, the United States has both resentment and anger towards France's attitude. "The New York Times" said: "Some American officials deeply regret the stubborn, even arrogant attitude taken by this country, which we have always considered weak and dependent." Jackson, a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the US Congress and a Democrat, scolded De Gaulle for "blackmailing" the United States, saying, "We cannot succumb to France's blackmail." And more noteworthy is that the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group "Allied Forces," US General Norstad, threatened to "withdraw his fighter-bomber forces stationed in France" and move them to other bases, especially bases in Britain and West Germany.

    However, as soon as the news about the withdrawal of the strategic bomber squadron from France and its relocation to Britain came out, it immediately caused a commotion in Britain. According to reports, British Prime Minister Macmillan convened a meeting of military leaders and some ministers on the 9th to discuss the issues caused by this decision by the French government, especially "the possible increase in aircraft stationed in Britain." The day before, fifty Labour Party members of Parliament submitted a proposal in the House of Commons, "requesting the British government to follow France's example and refuse to store nuclear warheads held by the United States." The Committee of Direct Action Against Nuclear War also announced on the 8th that it was preparing to launch a campaign to oppose the establishment of missile launch bases in Britain.

    At the same time, the French government's attitude has not softened. On the 10th, the French government spokesman reiterated that it would not change its attitude of not allowing the storage of nuclear weapons in France. French Atomic Energy Minister Soustelle further stated that even though the United States does not let its allies know what others already know, France is "building its own nuclear weapons arsenal."

    Under such circumstances, the United States had to put on some kind faces to ease the situation. State Department Press Officer White tried his best to conceal the dispute with France. Norstad even hoped that France would continue to "cooperate" with the allies. "The New York Times" advocated that Eisenhower and De Gaulle should hold talks to "negotiate a new foundation for our oldest alliance."

### 法国板面孔　美英感头痛  北大西洋集团内一片混乱

    法国板面孔　美英感头痛
    北大西洋集团内一片混乱
    本报讯　戴高乐政府拒绝美国在法国领土上储存核武器引起的争吵，还在继续发展。法国的这一行动，像一颗炸弹一样，又在北大西洋侵略集团内部引起一片混乱和震惊。
    在日内瓦的美、英、法三国外交部长9日突然举行“紧急会议”，讨论“关于在法国储存核武器的紧急问题。”西方通讯社指出，“西方团结”已经“突然破裂”，这发生在西方外长急于拼凑“统一战线”对付日内瓦谈判的时候，不能不具有“严重的影响”。
    华盛顿政府人士对法国政府的这种不妥协态度极为担忧。合众国际社的一则消息说，美国害怕法国这一行动将在北大西洋联盟中引起今年3月以来“最大的混乱”。六年来，法国拒绝美国在它土地上储藏核武器，原已大大地妨碍了“保证使用原子武器的联盟的供应系统和策略上的灵活性”。因此，美国对于法国的态度是又怀恨、又恼怒。“纽约时报”说：“某些美国官员对于我们一直认为软弱和依赖人的这个国家采取的顽固、甚至傲慢态度，深感遗憾”。美国国会原子能联合委员会委员、民主党人杰克逊大骂戴高乐向美国进行“讹诈”，他说，“我们不能对法国的讹诈屈服”。而更值得注意的是，北大西洋集团“盟军”最高司令美国将军诺斯塔德扬言要“撤出他驻在法国的战斗轰炸机部队”，把它们移往其他基地，特别是英国和西德的基地上去。
    但是，这个关于撤出法国战略轰炸机队移往英国的消息一传出来后，立即在英国引起了骚动。据报道，英国首相麦克米伦9日召集了军事首脑和一些大臣举行会议，讨论由法国政府这个决定所引起的问题，特别是“可能增加驻英的飞机一事”。在这前一天，英国五十名工党议员在下院提出一项提案，“要求英政府仿效法国拒绝储存由美国保管的核弹头。”反对核战争直接行动委员会也在8日宣布，它正在筹备开展一项运动来反对在英国建立导弹发射基地。
    同时，法国政府的态度也没有软下来。10日法国政府发言人再次强调不改变不准在法储存核武器的态度。法国原子能部长苏斯戴尔更进一步说，尽管美国不让盟国知道别人已经知道的东西，法国也“正在建立它自己的核武器兵工厂”。
    在这种情况下，美国不得不装出一些和善的面孔来缓和一下。国务院新闻发布官怀特还竭力掩饰同法国的纷争。诺斯塔德甚至希望法国继续同盟国“合作”。“纽约时报”则在鼓吹艾森豪威尔和戴高乐进行会谈，来“谈判我们最悠久的联盟的新基础”。
