Great Prospects

The vigorous development of non-staple food production and the increased raising of livestock and poultry by state-owned farms are of great benefit to the farms and to the country.

First of all, the non-staple foods provided by state-owned farms will be supplied to the market in greater quantities, improve people's lives, and meet the country's export needs. For example, the number of pigs raised by state-owned farms in Liaoning has increased by 50% compared with the beginning of the year; and the number of chickens, ducks, etc., has increased by two and a half times compared with the beginning of the year. There are more than 700 state-owned farms across the country, with a cultivated area of about 18 million mu. If we calculate raising one pig and ten chickens per mu of cultivated land, we can raise 18 million pigs and 180 million chickens.

Secondly, farm income can be increased even more. According to statistics, the output value of one ton of meat is about equal to the output value of more than ten tons of grain; and the cost of producing one ton of meat is not much different from the cost of producing one ton of grain. At the same time, the development of livestock and poultry by state-owned farms can accumulate a large amount of manure, which is a reliable guarantee for increased agricultural production.

In this way, there are great prospects for developing non-staple food production in state-owned farms across the country.

    大有前途
    国营农场大力发展副食品生产，多养家畜家禽，对于农场，对于国家，都有很大好处。
    首先国营农场所提供的副食品，将会更多地供应市场，改善人民生活，并满足国家的出口需要。如辽宁各地国营农场养的猪已经比年初增加50％；鸡、鸭等已经比年初增加两倍半。全国国营农场有七百多个，耕地面积在一千八百万亩左右。如果以每亩耕地养一头猪，十只鸡计算，就可以养一千八百万口猪，一亿八千万只鸡。
    其次可以更多地增加农场的收入。据统计，一吨肉类的产值约等于十多吨粮食的产值；而生产一吨肉类的成本和生产一吨粮食的成本相差不多。同时，国营农场发展了家畜家禽，可以积大量粪肥，对于农业增产也是可靠的保证。
    这样看来，在全国的国营农场开展副食品生产，前途大有可为。
