They developed science and cultivated teachers. Fudan University Mathematics Department's Small-Scale Science Report Seminars are Well-Organized.

(Our dispatch) The academic research atmosphere in the Mathematics Department of Fudan University has always been relatively strong. In this atmosphere, teaching quality is improving, scientific research is developing, and young teachers are growing. One of their important experiences is to hold "small-scale science report seminars" led by professors and attended by young teachers and senior students.

The use of scientific seminars to develop science and cultivate young teachers began in 1931 with the differential geometry and function theory seminars hosted by Professors Su Buqing and Chen Jiangong. For nearly thirty years, they have persisted in this. During the readjustment of departments in 1952, there were only two people in one seminar, but they continued their activities, one speaking and the other listening, and they still gained something. The Party organization of Fudan University attached great importance to this long-accumulated experience. In 1954, the Party committee summarized this experience, overcame the shortcomings of the past, such as a narrow research scope, and greatly improved it. It was also promoted in all science departments of the university. After the rectification campaign, the number of seminars in the Mathematics Department alone increased from the original six to twelve.

Each seminar is composed of five to ten teachers with the same discipline. Some seminars have a senior teacher as a mentor. Seminars with weak guidance adopt the method of "the able serve as teachers." They meet once a week, and the content includes introducing current trends in mathematical science or the latest mathematical literature, reporting their research experiences and works, and discussing practical mathematical problems in national construction, etc. In the science seminars, senior teachers often lecture the young people on the basic knowledge necessary for scientific research; young teachers often divide up the work of reading some books and practice mutual teaching and learning. The members of the science seminars choose problems according to their abilities and take turns serving as reporters. After the report, everyone can point out errors in the report, or affirm, extend, and develop certain things in it.

One of the benefits of this kind of scientific seminar is that it helps young teachers to treat academic research rigorously. In the science seminars, things like this often happen: a young teacher who has just graduated from university is reporting on a certain topic when he is suddenly "checkmated" by a mentor or another comrade. This is either because he was careless and some loopholes were found; or because he was asked about conclusions that should have been obtained through complex calculations, but the reporter was too lazy to calculate them; more often, he had not read deeply enough and thought he had understood, but he exposed his flaws after a few questions in the discussion. In a differential geometry science seminar, a graduate student reported on an article and indirectly cited a theorem from another book. Professor Su Buqing asked him if he had checked the original book, and he blushed and said no. He should have checked it himself. After receiving such training, the young teachers gradually established a serious and conscientious attitude towards academic issues.

Scientific seminars enable teachers to achieve the latest scientific achievements together through mutual help and cooperation, so many teachers call seminars a fast, good, and economical method of mastering knowledge. For example, for a more profound and complex problem, they adopt the method of "dividing the troops," with each person understanding one aspect, and then exchanging what they have understood in the seminar, thus expanding everyone's knowledge domain. Some research papers are often improved after being reported in the seminar because of others' questions and repeated discussions. Several young teachers in the probability theory seminar studied for several months, but did not notice the essence of the connection between "random set function" and "random process." After being asked by the comrade leading the seminar, they realized that they did not understand it thoroughly and went back to make up for it. The seminars also often discover new topics worthy of exploration from a report, thus often making the theory more in-depth.

The small-scale science report seminar has a very significant effect on improving teaching quality. For example, several elective courses offered to fourth-year students mainly introduce the latest achievements in mathematics in recent years. Teachers often use the new knowledge gained from the seminars to compile teaching materials or tutor students. When young teacher He Chengqi was a student, he learned a theorem, and he thought it was not very meaningful, so he just memorized it; after becoming a teaching assistant, he learned an article in the seminar, which mentioned the meaning of this theorem in one place, and he realized that it had very wide applications. Since then, he consciously paid attention to this point when tutoring students. In another seminar, a teacher once expanded the famous Bernstein theorem in approximation theory; young teacher Li Xun listened to this teacher's report, and since then, when lecturing students, he was able to grasp the essence of the Bernstein theorem—the inequality—and pointed out to the students the possibility of continuing to improve this theorem, opening up the way for students to think.

In the seminar, the mentor is the leading force. Professor Su Buqing said based on his own experience: "The mentor is like a helmsman, who must watch the wind direction, pay attention to the tide, and look for the new direction of the current development of mathematical science. In addition, the mentor should also guide each person in the seminar according to their different situations, so that they can grow rapidly." Of course, the seminar is not only beneficial to young teachers. Professors Su Buqing and Chen Jiangong said that they also learned a lot from it. Professor Su Buqing said: "Hundreds of articles are published in the mathematics field every month. How can I read them all? With the seminar, six or seven articles come to my mind every week, and they become my things."

The small-scale science report seminar is one of the important experiences in developing science and cultivating teachers. Even for teaching and research groups with weak foundations and weak guidance, it can still play a great role. Two-thirds of the twelve seminars in the Mathematics Department of Fudan University do not have mentors. They use the method of "the able serve as teachers," and the activities of the seminars are also very successful.

### 发展了科学　培养了师资  复旦大学数学系小型科学报告讨论会搞得好

    发展了科学　培养了师资
    复旦大学数学系小型科学报告讨论会搞得好
    本报讯　复旦大学数学系的学术研究气氛一向比较浓厚。在这样的气氛中，教学质量在提高，科学研究在发展，青年教师在成长。他们的重要经验之一，就是举行由教授指导、青年教师和高年级学生参加的“小型科学报告讨论会”。
    运用科学讨论会的形式来发展科学和培养青年教师，是1931年由苏步青、陈建功两位教授主持的微分几何和函数论两个讨论会首先开始的。将近三十年来，他们始终坚持不渝。1952年院系调整时，有一次讨论会只有两个人，他们仍然继续活动，一人讲，另一人听，同样有收获。复旦大学党组织十分重视这项长期积累起来的经验，1954年，党委总结了这一经验，克服了过去研究面较窄等缺点，使它有了很大的提高，并且在全校理科各系中加以推广。整风以后，仅是数学系的讨论会就从原来的六个发展到十二个。
    每个讨论会都由学科相同的五到十个教师组成。有的讨论会有一位老教师任导师，指导力量薄弱的讨论班就采取“能者为师”的办法。他们每周活动一次，内容是介绍当前数学科学动向或最新的数学文献，报告自己的研究心得和论著，讨论国家建设中的实用数学问题，等等。科学讨论会还常由老教师给青年们讲一些科学研究所必须具备的基础知识；青年教师们常分工读一些书，实行互教互学。科学讨论会的成员根据自己的能力选择问题，轮流担任报告人。报告以后大家可以指出报告中的错误，或者肯定、引伸、发展其中的某些东西。
    这种科学讨论会的好处之一是帮助青年教师严格对待学术研究。在科学讨论会上，常常发生这样的事情：一个刚从大学毕业不久的青年教师正在报告某一个专题的时候，突然被导师或别的同志“将”了“军”，这或者是因为自己粗心大意，一些漏洞被查出了；或者是对本来应该经过复杂计算才能获得的结论，因报告人怕麻烦不曾计算而被问住了；较多的情况是没有深入读书、自以为已经理解，在讨论会上经不起几声追问就露出破绽。在微分几何科学讨论会上一个研究生报告一篇文章时，从另一本书上间接引用一条定理。苏步青教授问他可曾查过原书，他红着脸说没有。本来他是应该亲自去查的。得到这样的训练后，青年教师们逐渐树立起严肃认真地对待学术问题的态度。
    科学讨论会能使教师在相互帮助、相互协作中共同取得最新的科学成就，因而很多教师称讨论会是一种多快好省地掌握知识的方法。例如对某一个较深奥、复杂的问题，他们采取“分兵出击”的办法，每人弄懂一个方面，然后将自己所懂得的这个方面在讨论会上交流，这样就扩大了每一个人的知识领域。一些研究论文，在讨论会上报告后，常因别人的提问和反复讨论得到提高。概率论讨论会好几个青年教师研究了几个月，都没有注意到“随机集合函数”与“随机过程”之间联系的本质。经领导这个讨论会的同志一问，才发觉自己理解得不彻底，事后又去补习。讨论会还常常从一篇报告中发现出一些新的值得探索的题目，因而往往使理论更深入一步。
    小型科学报告讨论会对教学质量提高的作用十分显著。如四年级同学开设的几门选修课，主要内容是介绍近年来数学上的最新成就。教师们常运用从讨论会上获得的新知识去编写教材或给学生们辅导。青年教师何成奇在当学生时学到一条定理，他以为它没有多大意思，只是背诵一阵就算了；担任助教以后，在讨论会上学到一篇文章，有一处谈到这一条定理的意义，才发觉它原来有很广泛的用处。从此他辅导学生时就有意识地注意了这一点。在另一个讨论会上，一位教师曾经拓广了逼近论中著名的贝恩斯坦定理；青年教师李训经听了这位教师的报告，从此在给学生讲课时就能够抓住贝恩斯坦定理的实质——不等式，并且向学生们指明这个定理的继续改善的可能性，为学生们开拓思考的道路。
    在讨论会里，导师是主导力量。苏步青教授根据自己的经验说：“导师像一个舵手，要观看风向、注意潮水，要看准当前数学科学发展的新方向。另外，导师也要根据讨论会每人的不同情况，指点他们，使他们迅速成长。”当然，讨论会不只对青年教师有好处，苏步青、陈建功二位教授说他们也从中学到很多东西。苏步青教授说：“数学界每月都有成百篇文章发表，自己怎能看得完。有了讨论会，每星期就都有六七篇文章到我脑子里来，它们就成了我的东西。”
    小型科学报告讨论会是发展科学、培养师资的重要经验之一，即使对基础薄弱、指导力量不强的教研组，它也一样能起很大作用。复旦大学数学系的十二个讨论班中有三分之二没有导师，他们以“能者为师”的办法，讨论会的活动也搞得很有成绩。
