   Bolivian Tin Mine Nationalization
    On April 9, 1952, the Bolivian people launched an armed uprising and overthrew the Bayevian dictatorial government supported by the United States. The new government, led by Paz Estenssoro of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement, promulgated a decree on October 31 of the same year, nationalizing the mines controlled by the three major tin mining companies—Patiño Mines, Hochschild Company, and Aramayo Company—and established the state-owned Bolivian Mining Corporation. The state monopolized the export of minerals.
    Bolivia is rich in tin mines, producing an average of 30,000 tons of tin annually, ranking second in the capitalist world in tin production. Minerals account for 90% of its exports, with tin accounting for 70% to 80%. Income from tin mines accounts for 80% to 90% of Bolivia's national income.
    Before nationalization, the tin mines were monopolized by the above-mentioned "Big Three Companies" controlled by American capital, with the United States directly holding one-third of the shares of the three major companies. The vast majority of the tin from the three major companies was shipped to factories in Texas City, USA, for smelting. These tin mining companies reaped fabulously high profits. According to Combola, the Bolivian Commercial Commissioner in Mexico at the time, the Patiño Mining Company, controlled by the Rockefeller financial group of the United States, made profits as high as 45,181 percent in the eight years from 1940 to 1948. The annual income of this company alone exceeded Bolivia's entire national revenue.
    The Bolivian people hated these "Big Three Companies," calling them "termites." The "termites" not only plundered wantonly, but also became a state within a state in Bolivia. They manipulated Bolivia's economic and political life, arbitrarily dismissing and appointing presidents and ministers, formulating or abolishing laws and orders, and controlling Bolivia's army and police.
    Since Bolivia implemented the nationalization of tin mines, US imperialism has been using various despicable means to force the Bolivian government to change its nationalization policy. When these attempts failed, it repeatedly instigated armed rebellions to subvert the Bolivian government. (Ling)

### 玻利维亚的锡矿国有化

   玻利维亚的锡矿国有化
    1952年4月9日，玻利维亚人民发动武装起义，推翻了美国所扶植的巴伊维昂独裁政府。以帕斯·艾斯顿索罗为首的民族主义革命运动党组成的新政府，在同年10月31日，颁布法令，将三大锡矿公司——巴蒂诺矿业公司、豪契斯却尔德公司和阿拉马约公司——所控制的矿山收归国有，建立了国营玻利维亚矿业公司，矿产的出口由国家实行垄断。
    玻利维亚盛产锡矿，每年平均产锡三万吨，占资本主义世界锡产的第二位。它的出口产品中90％是矿产，其中锡占了70％至80％。锡矿的收入占玻利维亚国民收入的80％至90％。
    在国有化之前，锡矿是由美国资本控制的上述“三巨头公司”所垄断，美国直接掌握着三大公司的三分之一股票。三大公司绝大部分的锡都运到美国德克萨斯城的工厂去熔炼。这些锡矿公司攫取了神话般的高利。据当时玻利维亚驻墨西哥的商务专员孔伯拉说：美国洛克菲勒财团所控制的巴蒂诺矿业公司自1940年至1948年的八年中利润高达百分之四万五千一百八十一，这一家公司每年的收入就超过玻利维亚的全部国家岁入。
    玻利维亚人民痛恨这“三巨头公司”，把它称为“蛀虫”。“蛀虫”不仅大肆进行掠夺，而且还成为玻利维亚的国中之国。它操纵了玻利维亚的经济和政治生活，任意黜免和安置总统与部长，制订或取消法律和命令，并控制着玻利维亚的军队和警察。
    玻利维亚实行锡矿国有化后，美帝国主义一直使用各种卑鄙手段，迫使玻利维亚政府改变国有化政策。当这些企图不能得逞时，就一再策动武装叛乱，来颠复玻利维亚政府。（玲）
