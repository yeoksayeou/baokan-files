Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 10th – Premier Castro said in a television program last night: "The Cuban people are prepared to cope with all dangers of aggression or invasion."

Castro pointed out that all kinds of conspiracies to invade Cuba are possible, but the Cuban people will certainly be able to defeat any aggression. He said, "With a people like Cuba, there is no danger... those who sabotage the revolution will certainly be the ones to suffer."

Referring to the recent incidents of provocation against Cuban diplomatic personnel in Miami, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, he said, "These incidents are part of a series of provocations against Cuba. They are not isolated." He pointed out that these provocations have powerful foreign interest groups behind them.

In his speech, Castro stated that resolute measures must be taken to deal with landlords who resist land reform. He said, "The large estate owners are mobilizing smallholders in Pinar del Río province, and we will also hold a farmers' congress in Pinar del Río province to deal with them. To deal with the counter-revolutionary movement, we will mobilize 500,000 farmers to participate in the Havana congress." Castro said, "We are prepared to take the necessary measures to defend the revolution and the interests of the people. We will implement criminal sanctions. If the day comes when revolutionary law must be enforced again in Cuba, it will be the fault of those criminals themselves."

Castro condemned the conspiracy of large estate owners colluding with American monopolists to attack land reform. He read out a secret letter written by a large cattle rancher on February 25 of this year to the Francisco Sugar Company on Wall Street, New York. This letter revealed that the large cattle rancher had attempted to use $500,000 to buy off various newspapers in order to sabotage Cuba's land reform. He also read out another secret letter, which revealed the conspiracy of Latin American anti-communist organizations to sabotage the Cuban revolution under the pretext of "opposing communism." Castro then announced the refusal to accept the five million pesos and 10,000 calves "donated" by large estate owners, wealthy peasants, and large cattle ranchers for land reform. Castro said, "They are trying to use this money to buy off the government and hinder the implementation of revolutionary laws. We do not need this so-called assistance from counter-revolutionaries." He said, "We cannot be bought off with five million pesos, not even with all the large estates and sugar mills." He emphasized, "Land reform is the goal of the Cuban people and should be supported in every possible way."

The United States has attacked Cuba's land reform, saying that it will reduce Cuba's sugar production. To refute this claim, Castro referred to a recent letter from the Cuban government to the U.S. government, which mentioned a proposal to supply eight million tons of sugar to the U.S. market in 1961. Castro said, "It seems difficult for the United States to accept this, and in this way, its argument against land reform falls apart."

    卡斯特罗重申保卫革命的决心
    主张坚决制裁反抗土改的地主
    大庄园主竭力勾结美国老板阴谋破坏土改
    新华社哈瓦那10日电　卡斯特罗总理在昨晚的电视节目中说：“古巴人民已作好准备以应付一切侵略或入侵的危险”。
    卡斯特罗指出，各种各样侵略古巴的阴谋都可能发生，但是古巴人民一定能击败任何侵略。他说，“有了古巴这样的人民就没有危险……倒霉的一定是那些破坏革命的人”。
    他在谈到最近在迈阿密、尼加拉瓜、多米尼加和海地所发生的对古巴外交人员进行挑衅的事件时说，“这些事件是对古巴一系列挑衅中的一部分。它们不是孤立的。”他指出，这些挑衅有强大的外国利益集团为背景。
    卡斯特罗在演说中表示，必须以坚决的手段来对付那些反抗土地改革的地主。他说，“大庄园主在比那尔德里奥省对小所有者进行动员，我们也要在比那尔德里奥省举行农民大会来对付他们。为了对付反革命运动，我们将要动员五十万农民来参加哈瓦那的大会。”卡斯特罗说，“我们准备采取必要的措施保卫革命和人民的利益。我们将实行刑事制裁。如果有那么一天不得不再度在古巴执行革命法制的话，这将是那些犯罪分子自己的过错。”
    卡斯特罗谴责大庄园主勾结美国垄断资本家攻击土地改革的阴谋。他宣读了大牧畜业主今年2月25日写给纽约华尔街弗兰西斯科糖公司的一封秘密信。这封信透露，大牧畜主曾企图用五十万美元去收买各家报纸以便破坏古巴的土地改革。他还宣读了另一封秘密信件，其中揭露拉丁美洲反共组织企图用“反对共产主义”的借口来破坏古巴革命的阴谋。卡斯特罗接着宣布拒绝接受大庄园主、富农和大牧畜业主为土地改革“捐献”的五百万比索和一万头牛犊。卡斯特罗说，“他们企图用这笔钱收买政府，阻碍革命法律的实施。我们不需要反革命的这种所谓援助。”他说，“我们是不能用五百万比索来收买的，即使用所有的大庄园和糖厂也不能收买我们。”他强调指出，“土地改革是古巴人民的目标，应尽一切可能去支持它”。
    美国曾经攻击古巴的土地改革会使古巴糖的产量减少。为了驳斥这种说法，卡斯特罗谈到古巴政府不久前给美国政府的一封信，这封信提到在1961年向美国市场供应八百万吨糖的建议。卡斯特罗说，“看来美国很难接受这点，这样一来，它攻击土地改革的论点就不攻自破了。”（附图片）
