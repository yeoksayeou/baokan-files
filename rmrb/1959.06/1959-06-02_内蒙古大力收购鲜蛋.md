Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 1st. The commercial system of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is actively purchasing fresh eggs throughout the region. Due to the importance attached to this work in various places, the number of purchases is increasing daily. The average daily purchase of fresh eggs in the region in early April was 33,000 jin, which reached 80,000 jin in early May, and 96,000 jin in mid-May. As of May 25, the region had purchased 4.67 million jin of fresh eggs this year.

In order to strengthen the purchasing work, many places in Inner Mongolia have established and improved the fresh egg purchasing network, and added fixed purchasing points and mobile purchasing groups. Some places have also adopted the method of signing production and sales contracts with the communes, so that the purchasing plans are implemented to the communes. In the purchasing process, various places generally collect, pack, and transport eggs immediately, accelerating transportation and reducing losses. (Attached picture)

    内蒙古大力收购鲜蛋
    新华社呼和浩特1日电　内蒙古自治区商业系统正在全区范围内积极收购鲜蛋。由于各地重视这一工作，收购数量日益增加。全区4月上旬平均每天收鲜蛋三点三万斤，到5月上旬就达到八万斤，中旬达到九点六万斤。到5月25日止，全区今年已收购鲜蛋四百六十七万斤。
    为了加强收购工作，内蒙古许多地方都建立和健全了鲜蛋收购网，增设了固定收购点和流动收购组。有些地方还采取同公社签订产销结合合同的办法，使收购计划落实到社。各地在收购中，一般都是随收、随装、随运，加速了调运，降低了损耗。（附图片）
