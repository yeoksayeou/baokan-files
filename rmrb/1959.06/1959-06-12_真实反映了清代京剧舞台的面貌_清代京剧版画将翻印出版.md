Xinhua News Agency, 11th: A batch of Qing Dynasty "Peking Opera Woodblock Prints," treasured by woodblock print collector Wang Shucun, has now been submitted to Beijing Publishing House for selection and compilation into a book, which will be published soon.

These woodblock prints were mostly drawn by famous painters from Yangliuqing and other places in Beijing during the heyday of Peking Opera art in the Qianlong, Jiaqing, and Xianfeng periods of the Qing Dynasty, while watching the opera. Many of them are quick sketches of old actors at the time, which quite realistically reflect the appearance of the Peking Opera stage at that time.

Peking Opera has a history of nearly two hundred years. In addition to written records, early Peking Opera character facial makeup, costumes, stages, and performance techniques can only occasionally be seen in clay sculptures or paintings. The more than one hundred opera paintings collected in this album depict various roles including *sheng* (male), *dan* (female), *jing* (painted face male), *mo* (older male), and *chou* (clown). There are civil dramas and martial dramas; there are small scenes with a few people, and there are also quite magnificent group scenes; some dramas are no longer popular or have been lost. The woodblock print authors have made precise depictions of the characters' appearance and demeanor. Each move and style conforms to the performance rules of the opera, and is vivid and expressive, with the simple and healthy style unique to Yangliuqing woodblock prints. The engraving of these woodblock prints is very detailed, and Peking Opera critic Tao Junqi has provided annotations for this album of woodblock prints.

Woodblock prints depicting the life of the Qing Dynasty Peking Opera stage are rich and colorful, and there are many types. However, the original plates of these woodblock prints were mostly destroyed by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War, and the remaining small part was also scattered and incomplete. The reprinting and publication of this album of "Peking Opera Woodblock Prints" allows the precious heritage of previous artists to be passed on and promoted. Ma Shaobo, Vice President of the China Peking Opera Theatre, believes in the preface he wrote for this album of woodblock prints that these woodblock prints "are valuable whether for research or artistic appreciation."

    真实反映了清代京剧舞台的面貌
    清代京剧版画将翻印出版
    新华社11日讯　版画收藏家王树村珍藏的一批清代“京剧版画”，现交由北京出版社选辑成册付印，将于最近出版。
    这些版画，大部分是清朝乾隆、嘉庆、咸丰年间京剧艺术全盛时期由杨柳青等地著名画师在北京一边看戏一边描绘的，很多是当时一些老伶工的速写像，相当真实地反映了当时京剧舞台的面貌。
    京剧已有近二百年的历史，早期京剧角色的脸谱、服饰、舞台以及表演技巧等，除文字记载外，只能偶尔见诸泥塑或画幅。这册版画中收集的一百多幅剧画，所描绘的包括生、旦、净、末、丑各个行当。其中有文戏，有武戏；有几个人的小场面，也有相当雄伟的群戏场面；有些戏目前已经不流行或已失传。版画作者对于人物的形貌神态，都做了精确的刻划，一招一式既符合戏曲的表演规律，又生动传神，富有杨柳青版画独具的朴素、健康的风格。这些版画的刻工很细致，京剧评论家陶君起为这册版画作了注解。
    描绘清代京剧舞台生活的版画，丰富多彩，种类繁多。但是这些版画的原版大部分在抗日战争时期被日寇毁坏，剩下的一小部分也散失不全。这册“京剧版画”的翻印出版，使前代艺人的珍贵遗产得以流传和发扬。中国京剧院副院长马少波在给这册版画所作的序言中认为，这些版画“无论是研究价值或者艺术欣赏价值，都是值得珍贵的”。（附图片）
