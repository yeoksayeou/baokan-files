    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 30th: Madras dispatch: Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh stated in a speech in Madras on May 28th, calling on people to "bring the message of Sino-Indian friendship to every Indian family, in order to defeat the conspiracies of anti-socialist forces attempting to undermine the policy of peaceful coexistence."
    Ghosh issued this call at the representative conference of the Indian Communist Party's Tamil Nadu region. He pointed out that some say that India's policy of peaceful coexistence "is in a state of serious tension due to the Tibet incident," and this view is reasonable. He said, "This tension is mainly caused by the actions now being constantly taken by those who are completely opposed to the policy of peaceful coexistence with socialist China."
    Ghosh said that those who have always expressed sympathy for the feudal nobles of Tibet have no real sympathy or concern for the well-being of the Tibetan masses. He said that for hundreds of years, the masses of the Tibetan people had lived under the tyranny of serfdom until the Chinese Communist Party made genuine efforts to change this situation.
    Ghosh also pointed out that those who sympathize with the Tibetan feudal nobles want to use the rebellion of upper-class elements in Tibet to drag India onto the track of the Cold War. He said that although the Indian Praja Socialist Party often professes in every possible way that it wants "socialism" and not capitalism, in their hearts they want to break the relationship between India and socialist countries. He said that the general line of the Praja Socialist Party is to oppose anything that would strengthen cultural and trade ties between India and socialist countries.

    印共总书记号召印度人民维护印中友谊
    击败破坏和平共处政策的阴谋
    新华社新德里30日电　马德拉斯消息：印度共产党总书记高士5月28日在马德拉斯发表讲话，号召“把印中友谊的讯息带给每一个印度家庭，以便击败反社会主义势力企图破坏和平共处政策的阴谋。”
    高士是在印度共产党泰米尔纳德地区的代表会议上发出这样的号召的。他指出，有人说，印度的和平共处政策，“已经由于西藏事件而处在严重的紧张状态”，这种看法是有道理的。他说，“这种紧张状态主要是由那些完全反对同社会主义中国和平共处的那种政策的人们现在不断采取的行动所造成的。”
    高士说，那些一直对西藏的封建贵族表示同情的人对西藏群众的幸福没有任何真正的同情和关怀。他说，在中国共产党现在作出真正的努力之前，数百年来，西藏的人民群众一直在农奴制度的暴政下生活。
    高士还指出，那些同情西藏的封建贵族的人想利用西藏上层分子的叛乱把印度拉上冷战的轨道。他说，印度人民社会党人虽然常常百般表白它要“社会主义”而不要资本主义，但是在他们的心里却想使印度和社会主义国家之间的关系破裂。他说，人民社会党人的总路线是反对任何足以使印度和社会主义国家之间的文化和贸易联系加强的事情的。
