    Guanghua County Bailian People's Commune Victory Production Team
    Formulates Wheat Field and Granary Management System

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 2nd) The Victory Production Team of the Bailian People's Commune in Guanghua County, Hubei Province, recently summarized the experiences and lessons learned from threshing, grain transfer, and grain storage work in the summer and autumn seasons of last year. At the same time, they studied and formulated new methods to strengthen wheat field management and granary management to do a good job in summer grain harvesting, threshing, and storage.

    Before threshing, this team established a field management committee and established field management groups based on production teams, responsible for leading threshing and storage work. Each wheat field also established a professional threshing group, selecting responsible cadres or commune members to serve as field director and wheat field security guard. Their responsibilities are: to ensure thorough threshing and cleaning, accurate record-keeping, and good storage and fire prevention work, requiring no mold or loss of grain.

    A triplicate form system is implemented. Each time threshing is done, the variety, quantity, and destination of the grain are clearly recorded on the triplicate form, which is signed and stamped by the resident cadre, field director, or storekeeper. The triplicate forms are kept separately by the production team accountant, the small team accountant, and the storekeeper for production accounting and auditing.

    A separate warehouse management system is established. In addition to the public grain to be handed over to the state and the surplus grain to be sold under the unified management of the production team, each production team must prepare three types of warehouses: food grain warehouses, seed warehouses, and feed warehouses, strictly implementing the separate warehouse management system. At the same time, the warehouse numbers and specific procedures for grain entry, exit, weighing, accounting, and management are clearly stipulated. Grain allocation must be approved by the production team, with a transfer order as proof. (Qu Yifan)

    光化县白莲公社胜利生产队
    订出麦场粮仓管理制度
    本报武汉2日电　湖北光化县白莲公社胜利生产队，最近总结了去年夏秋季打场、调粮和粮食保管工作中的经验和教训，同时研究制订了加强麦场管理和粮仓管理的新办法，做好夏粮的收割、打场和保管工作。
    这个队在打场以前，建立了一个管场委员会，以生产小队为单位建立管场小组，负责领导打场和保管等工作。每个麦场还建立专业的打场组，选出勇于负责的干部或社员担任场长和麦场保卫员。他们的责任是：保证打好收净，登清记实账目，做好保管和防火工作，要求不霉烂、不损失粮食。
    实行三联单制，即每打一场，对品种、数量以及粮食交往何处，都在三联单上登记清楚，由住场干部、场长或保管员签名盖章。三联单交生产队会计、小队会计和保管员各自保留一份，以备核算产量和查账。
    建立分仓管理制度，除应交国家的公粮、出售余粮由生产队统一管理外，每个生产小队都要准备好三种仓库，即口粮仓、种籽仓和饲料仓，严格执行分仓管理制度。同时，还明确规定了仓库编号和粮食入仓、出仓、过秤、记账、管理等具体手续。粮食调拨必经生产队批准，开具调拨单为凭。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（曲一凡）
