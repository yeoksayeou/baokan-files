Behind the Scenes

    Discuss Matters with the Masses
    Comrade Luo Shifa, the Party Branch Secretary of the Xinmin Production Team in Xinfan County, has consistently adhered to the mass line in his work for ten years, always consulting with the masses on matters. He has done a great job and achieved significant results, earning the praise of the commune members as a good cadre who is "tirelessly working for the commune members." He is a good example for leading cadres of grassroots Party organizations.

    When implementing policies and work tasks, leading cadres of grassroots Party organizations must "reveal the bottom line" and "open their hearts" to the masses. They must also share weal and woe with the masses, truly integrate with them, and take the lead in production. Only in this way can they maintain close ties with the masses, gain their support, and truly plan and manage things well. Comrade Luo Shifa does this, and many Party Branch Secretaries in people's communes across the country do the same. We hope that every Party Branch Secretary can do this, diligently carrying out the Party's various tasks.

    有事同群众商量
    新繁县新民生产队的党支部书记罗世发同志，十年如一日地在工作中处处走群众路线，有事就和群众商量，做得很好，很有成绩，被社员称赞为“万般辛苦为社员”的好干部。这是基层党组织的领导干部的好榜样。
    基层党组织的领导干部，在执行政策和工作任务时，要向群众“交底”，“交心”，还要与群众同甘共苦，真正和群众打成一片，在生产上带头干。这样，才能够做到密切联系群众，得到群众的支持，真正把事情谋好，办好。罗世发同志是这样做的，各地人民公社也有不少党支部书记也是这样做的。我们希望每个党支部书记都能这样做，认真把党的各种工作做好。
