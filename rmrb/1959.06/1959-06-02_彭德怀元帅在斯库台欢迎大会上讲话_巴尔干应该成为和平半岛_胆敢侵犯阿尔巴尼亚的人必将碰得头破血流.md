Xinhua News Agency, Skadar, May 31st: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai, and accompanied by Albanian First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Defense, Baluku, visited the city of Skadar, the political, economic, and cultural center of northern Albania, today.

That day, the entire city was adorned with red flags. Banners with large characters written in Chinese, reading "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Chinese and Albanian People," were hung high on the streets.

At 11:00 a.m., as the delegation drove into the city, tens of thousands of citizens braved the rain to line the streets and welcome them. Children in national costumes presented bouquets of flowers to Marshal Peng Dehuai and all members of the delegation.

The delegation attended a welcome rally with 10,000 participants.

Baluku delivered a welcome speech at the rally, saying that the Albanian people wholeheartedly love and respect the great Chinese people, and regard them as their dear and loyal friends. The Albanian people are grateful for the generous assistance from the fraternal Chinese people and government, and consider this assistance an important contribution to Albania's socialist construction.

Baluku emphasized that the efforts made by the Chinese Communist Party to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the international communist movement have further strengthened the heartfelt love of our Party and people for the Chinese people, the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and the beloved leader Comrade Mao Zedong. Our friendship is as solid as a rock and is strengthening and consolidating day by day.

Then, Marshal Peng Dehuai spoke amidst warm applause and cheers.

Marshal Peng Dehuai spoke of the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Albanian people, and the great achievements made in socialist construction since liberation. Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Albanian People's Army, tempered in the flames of war, has been built into a new type of revolutionary army that has mastered modern combat technology, vigilantly guarding the forefront of the socialist camp. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have always regarded the achievements made by the fraternal Albanian people and army as their own. We are proud and happy to have such a heroic brother in the big family of the socialist camp.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the general characteristic of the current international situation is: the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly consolidated and strong. All provocations, curses, and conspiracies of sabotage by imperialism and its lackeys against the socialist camp will be futile, and will not save them from their inevitable doom.

Peng Dehuai continued, it is necessary to mention the reactionary rulers of some of your neighboring countries here. They go against the will of the people and agree to the United States establishing missile bases on their territory, or are conducting such negotiations with the United States, trying to turn the Balkan Peninsula into a powder keg of war. Their dangerous game of playing with fire is of course extremely unfriendly and extremely unwise. We fully agree with what Comrade Khrushchev recently said, that the Balkans should become a peninsula of peace. We hope that the Balkan people will live in peace, and we hope that all countries with different social systems in the world will coexist peacefully. However, if anyone goes crazy and dares to invade Albania, dares to provoke a new world war, then they will be met with crushing defeat, and the ending will not be pleasant for them. They will inevitably repeat the disastrous path taken by Hitler and Mussolini.

Marshal Peng Dehuai finally emphasized that the great cause of communism closely connects us together. In the long-term struggle against modern revisionism, in maintaining the purity of Marxism-Leninism, in consolidating the international communist movement, in building socialism, and in the struggle to defend peace, the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will stand with you at all times.

At the welcome rally, Marshal Peng Dehuai presented a military flag of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the Albanian People's Army.

After accepting the military flag, Minister Baluku warmly embraced Marshal Peng Dehuai and said to the welcoming crowd that accepting this military flag is an honor for our People's Army. We will firmly stand on the forefront of the socialist camp – the Adriatic Sea, defending socialism and defending world peace.

The delegation paid a visit to the party and government leaders of Skadar today, visited an agricultural cooperative in Skadar, and watched a wonderful cultural performance by the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Albanian People's Army in the evening.

    彭德怀元帅在斯库台欢迎大会上讲话
    巴尔干应该成为和平半岛
    胆敢侵犯阿尔巴尼亚的人必将碰得头破血流
    据新华社斯库台31日电　以彭德怀元帅为首的中国军事友好代表团，今天由阿尔巴尼亚部长会议第一副主席兼国防部长巴卢库陪同，来到阿尔巴尼亚北部的政治、经济和文化中心斯库台城进行访问。
    这一天，全城红旗招展。街道上高悬着用中文书写的“阿中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁”的大字横幅标
  语。
    十一时，当代表团驱车进入市区时，成千上万的市民冒雨夹道欢迎，穿着民族服装的儿童把一束束鲜花献给彭德怀元帅和代表团全体同志。
    代表团出席了有一万人参加的欢迎大会。
    巴卢库在会上致欢迎词说，我国人民衷心地热爱和尊敬伟大的中国人民，把他们看成是自己的亲爱的和忠实的朋友。我国人民感谢兄弟的中国人民和政府的慷慨援助，并认为这种援助对阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设是一个重要的贡献。
    巴卢库强调说，中国共产党为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动所做出的努力，进一步加强了我们党和人民对中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和亲爱的领袖毛泽东同志的衷心热爱。我们的友谊坚如盘石，并一天一天地加强和巩固。
    接着，彭德怀元帅在热烈的掌声和欢呼声中讲了话。
    彭德怀元帅谈到了阿尔巴尼亚人民的光荣的革命传统，以及解放后在社会主义建设中所获得的巨大成就。彭德怀元帅说，在战火中锻炼出来的阿尔巴尼亚人民军，已建设成为一支掌握了现代化作战技术的新型的革命军队，警惕地守卫着社会主义阵营的最前哨。中国人民和中国人民解放军一向把兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民和军队所取得的成就看成是自己的成就。我们为社会主义阵营的大家庭中有了这样一个英雄的兄弟而感到光荣和高兴。
    彭德怀元帅说，目前国际局势总的特点是：敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益巩固和壮大。帝国主义及其走狗们对于社会主义阵营的一切挑衅、咒骂和阴谋破坏，都将是徒劳的，都不能挽救他们必然死亡的命运。
    彭德怀接着说，这里不能不提到你们某些邻邦的反动统治者。他们违背人民的意愿，同意美国在他们的国土上建立导弹基地，或者正在和美国进行这种谈判，想把巴尔干半岛变成为战争火药库。他们这种危险的玩火把戏当然是极不友好的，也是极不识时务的。我们完全同意最近赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，巴尔干应该成为和平的半岛。我们希望巴尔干人民在和平中生活，希望世界上一切不同社会制度的国家和平共处。但是，如果谁要发疯，胆敢侵犯阿尔巴尼亚，胆敢挑起新的世界战争，那么，他们就将碰得头破血流，结局对他们是不美妙的，他们必然要重复希特勒和墨索里尼所走过的惨败道路。
    彭德怀元帅最后强调说，伟大的共产主义事业把我们紧密地连接在一起，在反对现代修正主义、维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、巩固国际共产主义运动的长期斗争中，在建设社会主义和为保卫和平的斗争中，中国人民和人民解放军任何时候都和你们站在一起。
    彭德怀元帅在欢迎大会上，把一面中国人民解放军的军旗赠送给阿尔巴尼亚人民军。
    巴卢库部长接受了军旗以后，同彭德怀元帅热烈拥抱，并向欢迎的人群说，接受这一面军旗是我们人民军的荣誉，我们将坚定地站在社会主义阵营的前哨——亚得里亚海，保卫着社会主义，保卫世界和平。
    代表团今天拜会了斯库台的党政负责人，访问了斯库台的农业合作社，晚间观看了阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团的精彩文娱表演。
