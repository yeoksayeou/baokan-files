Understanding It, Mastering It, Developing It
—On the Student Cadres' Process of Creating Boiler Framework Calculation Formulas
Wang Yunmei
"In science, there is no smooth road to travel. Only those who are not afraid of hard work in climbing rugged paths have the hope of reaching the glorious peak." At Harbin Institute of Technology, people used the revolutionary teachers' teachings to praise Wang Xianqing, Liu Guangfa, and Zhang Guansheng (the secretary of the Communist Party Youth League) of the boiler major class of 1955, who studied diligently and created the calculation formula for the boiler framework.

In the past, students majoring in boilers had to go through a "time-consuming and labor-intensive" difficult assignment—using the "trial and error method" to do "boiler framework strength design."

Wang Xianqing, the Communist Party Youth League branch secretary of Boiler Class 55-2, was determined to change this complicated and outdated "trial and error method" and reduce the burden on students when doing design work. He hunched over his desk, carefully verifying calculations, but the result was wrong.

Wrong! This is a very common thing; how can students not make mistakes? Especially with these complicated addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. This person, who was unwilling to be sloppy in work and study, always felt that everything should have its reason. So, he became very interested in studying the pile of numbers that others thought should have been thrown away and recalculated, and discovered that one number in particular was not changing according to the pattern of decreasing from large to small. In this way, he finally found the fixed proportional relationship between one number and the next.

Wang Xianqing's discovery enlivened the quiet learning atmosphere of the boiler class of 1955. In the evening, the dormitory he lived in was buzzing with debate. The next day, at a report meeting organized by the Communist Party Youth League branch where Wang Xianqing introduced how to simplify calculation methods using proportional relationships, students from various classes came to offer suggestions: some suggested "drawing curves," and more students believed that they should start with the "distribution coefficient" because this is the most essential thing that distinguishes a boiler framework from other frameworks; only by grasping it could they hope to deduce a calculation formula. After everyone's debate and inspiration, Wang Xianqing's thinking became more open-minded, and he decided to continue his research along the path pointed out by his classmates, and he also attracted Xu Peifu, who lived in the same dormitory, to actively participate.

In Boiler Class 55-1, Liu Guangfa was also exploring. This young man, who was unwilling to be satisfied with some of the knowledge taught by teachers or in books, thought this when the "boiler framework strength design" assignment was assigned: "When I go to a production post to carry out engineering design in the future, will I have to let the urgent construction tasks wait for me, the engineer, to slowly grind away using the 'trial and error method'?" He kept flipping through the "Mechanics of Materials" notes he had learned two years ago, reviewing the principle that "force and deformation are directly proportional," and as a result, he took the same path as Wang Xianqing—finding a shortcut to simplify the "trial and error method" calculation using proportional relationships.

At the same time, Zhang Guansheng, the secretary of the Communist Party Youth League committee, who was auditing classes in this grade, a Communist Party member who was both good at work and willing to study, was also thinking about this issue. When Zhang Guansheng heard that his good friend Wang Xianqing had made new discoveries on this issue, he was very happy. He actively cooperated with Wang Xianqing and other students to further study this issue. They worked intensely in the dormitory, deriving formulas step by step; they flipped through "Advanced Mathematics," "Mechanics of Materials," and "Structural Mechanics" in the reading room, concentrating on calculations. Late at night, when the reading room closed, they moved to the Communist Party Youth League committee office to continue calculating; when the teaching building where the Communist Party Youth League committee was located was about to be locked, they moved to the dormitory to continue the calculations. Fewer and fewer pedestrians appeared on campus, and the lights in the student dormitories were turned off one by one, only the lights in their room were still on. The calculation equations were finally derived, but they were still not at ease and repeatedly verified the calculations again and again. Finally, they found the boiler framework calculation formula.

    理解它　掌握它　发展它
    ——记学生干部创造锅炉骨架计算公式的经过
    王云梅
      “在科学上面是没有平坦的大道可走的。只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，才有希望到达光辉的顶点。”在哈尔滨工业大学，人们用革命导师的教言，这样赞誉那在学习中刻苦钻研，创造出锅炉骨架计算公式的锅炉专业五五年级团支委王铣庆、刘广发和团总支书记、共产党员张管生。
    过去，锅炉专业的学生都要经过一道“耗时惊人、工作量大”的作业难关——用“试凑法”做“锅炉骨架强度设计”。
    锅炉五五——二班团支委王铣庆一心想改变这繁杂过时的“试凑法”，减轻学生做设计时的负担，他扒在书桌上，小心翼翼地验算着，结果算错了。
    错了！这是很平常的事，学生那有不错题的？更何况是这些加加、减减、乘乘、除除的烦杂运算。这个在工作和学习上都不肯马虎
  “让步”的人，总觉得任何事情都应该有它的道理。于是他又满感趣地对那堆别人认为早该扔了重算的数字考究起来，而且发现其中一个数字独独不是循着由大到小的规律变化。这样，终于找到了上一个数和下一个数之间固定的比例关系。
    王铣庆的发现，活跃了锅炉五五年级平静的学习空气。晚上，他住的寝室里争论得非常热闹。第二天，在团支部组织的由王铣庆介绍如何运用比例关系简化计算方法的报告会上，各个班同学都跑来出谋划策了：有的建议“画曲线”，更多同学认为应当从“分配系数”入手，因为这是一个锅炉骨架区别于其他骨架的最本质的东西，揪住它才有希望推导出一个计算公式来。经过大家争论和启发，王铣庆的思想更开窍了，他决定循着同学指出的路子钻研下去，而且还吸引了同寝室的徐佩孚积极参加。
    在锅炉五五——一班，刘广发也在那里摸索。这个在学习中不肯满足于老师或书本上所讲的一些知识的年青人，当“锅炉骨架强度设计”的作业一布置下来，就这样想：“以后到生产岗位上进行工程设计的时候，难道也得让紧急的建设任务等着我这个工程师用‘试凑法’那样慢慢地磨人吗？”他不断地翻阅着两年前学过的“材料力学”笔记，重温着“力与变形成正比”的原理，结果，同王铣庆走到了一条路子上——找到了用比例关系简化“试凑法”计算的捷径。
    同时，在这个年级听课的团总支书记张管生，一个既会工作又肯学习的共产党员，也正在思考这个问题。当张管生听到他的好朋友王铣庆对此问题已有新发现的时候，心里非常高兴。他主动与王铣庆等同学合作来进一步研究这个问题。他们紧张地在宿舍里一步步地推导公式；在阅览室里翻阅“高等数学”，“材料力学”、“结构力学”，专心致志地进行推算。深夜，阅览室闭馆了，他们搬到团总支办公室去推算，团总支所在的教学大楼又要锁门了，他们又搬到宿舍里继续演算。校园里的行人越来越少，学生宿舍的灯光一盏一盏地关闭了，只有他们所在的房间的灯还亮着。计算的方程式到底是推出来了，但他们仍不放心地一遍又一遍地反复验算着。终于，他们把锅炉骨架计算公式找出来了。
