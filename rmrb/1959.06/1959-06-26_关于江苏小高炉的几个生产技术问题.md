Several Production Technology Issues Regarding Small Blast Furnaces in Jiangsu
Lu Da, Director of the Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry

In the past short year, Jiangsu Province has achieved a great leap forward in steel production. Before last year, Jiangsu had no iron and steel industry at all. Since the Party put forward the general line of socialist construction and the complete set of policies of "walking on two legs," Jiangsu, like other parts of the country, has experienced an unprecedented leap in the iron and steel industry. In just half a year last year, it produced 220,000 tons of pig iron (about half of which was indigenous iron) and 50,000 tons of steel (about half of which was indigenous steel). According to our recent understanding of the situation in Jiangsu, the province is expected to produce 240,000 tons of iron and 25,000 tons of steel in the first half of this year, all of which are so-called modern iron and steel. Not only has the quantity greatly increased, but also the quality has greatly improved. It can be said that small blast furnace production has basically passed the technical barrier. In the year of conquering iron, the province has trained a group of iron and steel industry cadres and workers. The achievements of the past year are great.

Jiangsu has 208 blast furnaces, large and small, which can be put into production (with seven types of furnace volumes: 8, 13, 15.8, 28, 55, 84, and 255 cubic meters), with a total volume of approximately 3,300 cubic meters. Currently, there are 97 blast furnaces in production, with a total volume of 1,580 cubic meters (mainly 13 and 28 cubic meter blast furnaces). These blast furnaces are mainly distributed in Nanjing, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Changzhou, Suzhou, and other places, with a daily iron production of approximately 1,600 tons. Jiangsu's small blast furnace production is relatively good in terms of blast furnace utilization coefficient, pig iron quality, and coke ratio. The average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the province is approximately 1 (approximately one ton of iron produced per cubic meter per day), with some areas such as Changzhou reaching 1.5. In terms of pig iron quality, 60% to 70% of the province's pig iron is qualified (sulfur content below 0.2%), with a few reaching sulfur content below 0.07%. In terms of coke ratio, the province reached 1.33 in May, while Changzhou reached 1.04 to 1.13.

Experience in High Quality and High Yield

The reason why Jiangsu's small blast furnace production was able to pass the barrier relatively quickly is mainly because the enterprises concerned implemented the policy of focusing on quality, mobilizing the masses, and carrying out a technological revolution. In terms of ensuring pig iron quality, improving the utilization coefficient, and reducing the coke ratio, the masses have created a lot of experience and also learned and applied the experience of other regions. Summarized, there are mainly the following five aspects.

(1) Grasping the quality of coke. Currently, the coke produced in Wuxi is of the best quality. First, the ash content is low, averaging below 12% to 14%; second, the strength is good, and there is less broken coke. Because the ash content of coke is low, less coke is used for ironmaking (low coke ratio), and less sulfur is brought into the blast furnace by the coke (the sulfur content in pig iron mainly comes from coke), thus improving the quality of pig iron. Good coke strength means that it is not easy to break, which can reduce the loss of broken coke, and at the same time prevent the coke from breaking into powder in the blast furnace, blocking the blast furnace and affecting smelting. Wuxi has grasped three key points in producing good coke, namely, crushing, coal washing, and calcination. They created a small coke crushing machine (cage crusher), and all coking coal is crushed, with the particle size of the coal below three millimeters. In this way, when loading the kiln for coking, the coal can be loaded tightly, and the coke produced is dense and has good strength. After crushing, it is also conducive to coal washing. In terms of coal washing, Wuxi uses a simple jig coal washing machine, which works very well, and the ash content of the coal can be reduced to about 10%, which strongly guarantees the quality of the coke. The production capacity of Wuxi's crushing machine and coal washing machine is approximately 20 tons per hour for each unit. The manufacture of each set of equipment (including coal washing and crushing) requires approximately 3.5 tons of steel, 1.5 tons of pig iron, and 5 cubic meters of wood, and the manufacturing cost is approximately 25,000 yuan (excluding construction and installation). It seems that this set of equipment is simple, effective, and inexpensive, and it is worth promoting in small coking plants in various places. The last link in coking is calcination. Wuxi uses earth kilns, and their operational characteristics are: uniform fire, fast burning, and high temperature. Therefore, the coke is well caked.

The quality of coke in other regions of Jiangsu has also improved recently. Suzhou and Nanjing are relatively poor, with coke ash content around 20%. The problem lies in promoting Wuxi's experience well throughout the province.

(2) Adopt high air temperature and large air volume operation. Increasing the air temperature is a major measure to improve small blast furnace production. After cadres and workers of ironmaking enterprises in Jiangsu actively studied and learned from foreign experience, they improved the furnace structure and operation method of hot blast stoves. Xuzhou also adopted a multi-nozzle combustion heating method (applying more gas combustion nozzles to the hot blast stove to increase the heating, which can increase the hot air temperature), which generally increased the air temperature, now generally reaching about 500 degrees Celsius, and Xuzhou reaching 600 degrees Celsius. After the air temperature is increased, the amount of heat brought into the blast furnace by the air increases, which can save coke and help the blast furnace desulfurize, improving the quality of pig iron.

Large air volume operation means that the amount of air blown into the blast furnace is large. This can speed up the blast furnace smelting process and increase the blast furnace utilization coefficient. In order to increase the air volume, various places in Jiangsu mostly use double machine parallel connection (two fans blowing one blast furnace), generally achieving an air volume blown into the blast furnace of three times the volume of the blast furnace per minute.

(3) Increase the alkalinity of small blast furnace slag. High slag alkalinity can improve the desulfurization ability of the blast furnace (after the raw materials enter the blast furnace for smelting, part of them are refined into pig iron, and the rest becomes slag. If sulfur does not enter the slag, it will enter the pig iron). In the past, Jiangsu generally formulated acidic slag in terms of feed-in ingredients, that is, the slag contained a large amount of quartz and a small amount of lime (quartz is acidic in the slag). Acidic slag cannot be desulfurized. In order to improve the quality of pig iron, they switched to alkaline slag, increasing the amount of limestone added to the blast furnace. Since May, the quality of pig iron has improved significantly. This is a decisive measure to pass the quality barrier.

(4) Do a good job in raw material preparation. Generally, various places in Jiangsu crush raw materials (ore, coke, limestone) and then sieve them, classifying them according to particle size before entering the furnace. In order to keep the composition of the ore entering the furnace stable, they adopted the "flat-laying and cutting" operation method to mix the ore evenly, and recently they have also paid attention to strengthening the testing work, testing the raw materials entering the furnace, and formulating the ingredients according to the composition.

(5) Strengthen testing work. Jiangsu Province held a training class for testing personnel last winter and a on-site conference on testing work this spring. Generally, each factory analyzes the raw materials entering the furnace and formulates ingredients according to the composition. Pig iron and slag are also tested and analyzed, so that smelting conditions can be understood, and the operation of the furnace and the quality of pig iron can be controlled.

Five Issues Need to Be Studied and Resolved

Although it can be said that the production technology of small blast furnaces in Jiangsu has basically passed the barrier, there is still great potential for improving production technology. At present, there are still the following five issues.

(1) The issue of mismatch between neighbors, auxiliary equipment, and the host. This is reflected in the fact that there are still uncoordinated phenomena in some production links. For example, in order to improve coke quality and reduce ash content, it is still necessary to appropriately supplement small crushing and coal washing equipment. In terms of ore crushing, some places still use manual crushing, which is not only labor-intensive and costly, but also often affects the quality of crushing due to insufficient labor; in terms of ore utilization, many places still have a lot of fine ore that cannot be utilized. This requires the addition of a small amount of crushing and sintering equipment, which can save labor and reduce costs; the use of fine ore after sintering can also save ore, improve blast furnace raw material conditions, and improve blast furnace output and pig iron quality (sintered ore is easier to smelt than ordinary ore). Also, the factory's machine repair force is generally insufficient in various places, equipment is lacking, and spare parts cannot be repaired in time when they are broken, often resulting in frequent blast furnace accidents and abnormal production. Internal and external transportation is also a weak link, and untimely transportation often causes abnormal production or accidents. These issues need to be resolved appropriately.

Jiangsu also often causes a reduction in blast furnace quality and output due to the low storage volume of coal. Coking coal is used as soon as it arrives, so that the coking coal is coked without washing and selection, and it is impossible to formulate coal according to the coal type. Therefore, measures need to be taken to maintain a certain amount of coal storage.

(2) The quality of pig iron still needs to be further improved by taking measures to steadily improve it. This includes three issues: first, to further increase the qualified rate of pig iron (sulfur content below 0.2%) to more than 90%, which is completely achievable. The second is to further reduce the sulfur content of pig iron. Individual regions and individual blast furnaces in Jiangsu (such as the 84 cubic meter blast furnace in Suzhou) have already achieved a sulfur content of pig iron below 0.07%. Further reduction of sulfur can promote the improvement of steelmaking production capacity and steel quality, and can promote cost reduction. The third is the issue of small blast furnaces producing multiple varieties. Pig iron is generally divided into two types: steelmaking pig iron and cast iron. In addition to the common requirement of low sulfur, cast iron requires a high silicon content (1.5% to 3%), while steelmaking pig iron requires a lower silicon content (converter requires silicon around 1.2%, and open hearth furnace requires below 1%). At present, the sulfur content of pig iron in Jiangsu has been reduced, but what comes with it is the increase in the silicon content of pig iron, which is generally around 2% to 3%. This is good for casting machines, but it will increase the smelting time for steelmaking and reduce the life of the steelmaking furnace lining. Therefore, requiring small blast furnaces to produce steelmaking pig iron also requires blast furnace workers to better master blast furnace operation technology.

(3) In terms of production technology, the production experience of small blast furnaces in various parts of Jiangsu is relatively complete when summarized. In addition, with the successful experience of some foreign countries, the potential for organizing comprehensive promotion and further improving production technology and economic indicators is still great.

First of all, in terms of coking, if Wuxi's experience is promoted throughout the province, the ash content of coke in Nanjing, Suzhou, and other places will drop from the current 20% to 12% to 14%, and the quality of pig iron and the utilization coefficient will be significantly improved, and coke can also be saved in large quantities (generally, for every 1% decrease in coke ash content, blast furnace output can increase by 2%). Secondly, in terms of blast furnace air temperature, if the multi-nozzle combustion heating method is promoted and applied, the air temperature can be increased from the current 500 degrees Celsius to more than 600 degrees Celsius; the experience of many places shows that when the air temperature is more than 500 degrees Celsius, increasing it by 100 degrees Celsius can save 100 to 200 kilograms of coke per ton of pig iron. Third, in terms of raw material treatment, many factories use calcined quicklime instead of limestone to enter the furnace. If this experience can be promoted, it can further save coke and improve the quality of pig iron.

(4) The issue of blast furnaces growing from small to large. The blast furnaces currently operating in Jiangsu are mainly 13 and 28 cubic meters. Their advantage is that they can quickly pass the production technology barrier and meet current needs, but they are not as economical as large blast furnaces. Most of the larger blast furnaces in Jiangsu have not yet been put into production. There are four 55 cubic meter units with complete sets, one of which is operating; there are two 84 cubic meter units, one of which is operating; and two 255 cubic meter units have not yet started operating. Therefore, when adjusting the layout of blast furnaces, a batch of small furnaces should be gradually shut down, and larger blast furnaces should be fully utilized. In this process, the technical problem is how to pass the technical barrier of medium-sized blast furnaces. The one 55 cubic meter blast furnace currently operating has production indicators that are not as good as those of the 13 and 28 cubic meter blast furnaces; the 84 cubic meter blast furnace has recently just passed the barrier of using indigenous coke. Getting medium-sized blast furnaces through the technical barrier is one of the current tasks.

(5) The issue of pig iron cost. At present, the cost of pig iron in Jiangsu is still high. In the first quarter, the average cost per ton of iron in the province was 335 yuan, with Xuzhou being the lowest at 265 yuan per ton and Yancheng being the highest at 450 yuan per ton. In the future, further taking various production technology measures to reduce the coke ratio, reduce coal consumption, appropriately adjust the layout, and fully utilize medium-sized blast furnaces, the cost can be greatly reduced.

    关于江苏小高炉的几个生产技术问题
    冶金工业部钢铁研究院院长　陆达
    江苏省在过去短短的一年中，钢铁生产有了一个伟大的跃进。去年以前，江苏根本没有钢铁工业。自从党提出社会主义建设的总路线和“两条腿走路”的一整套方针以后，江苏和全国其他地方一样，钢铁工业有了一个史无前例的飞跃的发展。去年仅半年时间，就炼出生铁二十二万吨（其中约一半是土铁），钢五万吨（其中约一半是土钢）。根据我们最近到江苏了解的情况，今年上半年全省可产生铁二十四万吨，钢二万五千吨，这都是所谓洋铁、洋钢。不仅数量大大增加，而且质量有了很大进步。可以说，小高炉生产在技术上已基本过了关。在一年来征服铁的斗争中，全省培养了一批钢铁工业的干部和工人。一年来的成绩是伟大的。
    江苏已经配套可以投入生产的高炉，大小有二百零八座（炉子的容积有八、十三、十五点八、二十八、五十五、八十四、二百五十五立方公尺七个类型），总容积约三千三百立方公尺。目前正在生产的高炉有九十七座，总容积有一千五百八十立方公尺（主要是十三和二十八立方公尺的高炉）。这些高炉主要分布在南京、无锡、徐州、常州、苏州等地，日产铁约一千六百吨左右。江苏小高炉生产，从高炉的利用系数、生铁的质量和焦比三方面来看，都是比较好的。全省小高炉平均利用系数约在一左右（每立方公尺日产铁一吨左右），有的地方如常州达到了一点五。生铁质量，全省60％到70％是合格的（含硫0.2％以下），其中有少数达到含硫0.07％以下。焦比，5月份全省达到一点三三，而常州则达到一点零四至一点一三。
    优质高产的经验
    江苏小高炉生产所以能较快地过关，主要是由于有关的企业实行了以质量为中心、发动群众、大闹技术革命的方针。在保证生铁质量、提高利用系数和降低焦比方面，群众创造了很多经验，也学习和应用了其他地区的经验。归纳起来，主要有以下五个方面。
    （一）抓焦炭的质量。目前，无锡炼的焦炭质量最好。一是灰分低，平均在12％到14％以下；二是强度好，碎焦少。由于焦炭灰分低，炼铁所用的焦炭就省（焦比低），由焦炭带进高炉的硫也就少（生铁中含的硫主要来自焦炭），生铁质量因此提高了。焦炭强度好，就不易破碎，可以减少碎焦的损耗，同时不致因焦炭在高炉中碎成粉末，阻塞高炉，影响冶炼。无锡炼好焦炭，抓了三个关键，即破碎、洗煤和烧成。他们创造了一种小型的焦煤破碎机（笼式破碎机），所有的炼焦煤都经过破碎，煤的粒度都在三公厘以下。这样，装窑炼焦时，煤能装得紧，炼出来的焦致密，强度就好。经过破碎，也利于洗煤。在洗煤方面，无锡采用的简易跳汰式洗煤机，效用很好，煤的灰分可以降到10％左右，有力地保证了焦炭质量。无锡的破碎机和洗煤机，生产能力每台每小时约二十吨，制造每套设备（包括洗煤和破碎）约需三点五吨钢材、一点五吨生铁和五立方公尺木材，制造费用约需二点五万元（不包括建筑安装）。看起来，这套设备简易有效，费钱不多，值得在各地小型炼焦厂推广。炼焦最后一环是烧成。无锡用的是土窑，他们操作上的特点是：火力均匀，烧得快，温度高。因此焦结得好。
    江苏其他地区焦炭的质量，最近也都有所提高。苏州、南京比较差，焦炭灰分在20％左右。问题在于将无锡经验很好地在全省推广。
    （二）采取高风温和大风量操作。提高风温是改进小高炉生产的一项主要措施。江苏炼铁企业的干部和工人，积极钻研和学习外地经验以后，改善了热风炉的炉型结构和操作方法，徐州还采取了多嘴燃烧加热法（在热风炉上应用更多的煤气燃烧嘴加热，可以提高热风温度），使风温普遍提高，现在一般都达到五百度左右，徐州达到六百度。风温提高以后，由风带进高炉的热量增多，既可以节省焦炭，又有助于高炉脱硫，提高生铁质量。
    大风量操作，即鼓进高炉的风量大。这样可以加快高炉冶炼过程，提高高炉利用系数。江苏各地为加大风量，多采用双机并联（两个风机吹一个高炉），一般做到每分钟鼓进高炉的风量三倍于高炉的容积。
    （三）提高小高炉炉渣碱度。炉渣碱度大，可以提高高炉脱硫能力（原料进高炉熔炼以后，一部分炼成生铁，其余就变成炉渣。硫不进炉渣就会进入生铁）。以往，江苏在入炉配料方面一般都配成酸性炉渣，即炉渣中含石英成分大，石灰成分小（石英在渣中呈酸性）。酸性渣是不能脱硫的。为了提高生铁质量，他们改用碱性渣，增加高炉中石灰石的加入量。5月份以来，生铁质量显著提高。这是过质量关的一项决定性措施。
    （四）做好原料准备工作。江苏各地一般都作到原料（矿石、焦炭、石灰石）破碎后过筛，按粒度大小分级入炉。为了使入炉矿石成分经常稳定，他们采取了“矿石平铺切取”混匀矿石的操作方法，最近还注意加强了化验工作，对入炉原料进行化验，根据成分配料。
    （五）加强化验工作。江苏省去冬举办了化验人员训练班，今春召开了化验工作现场会议。各厂一般都做到入炉原料经过分析，按成分配料。生铁和炉渣也进行化验分析，这样可以了解冶炼情况，控制炉子的操作和生铁质量。
    有五个问题需要研究解决
    江苏小高炉生产技术虽然说基本上已经过了关，但是生产技术的改进还有很大潜力。目前尚存在以下五个问题。
    （一）左邻右舍、辅助设备和主机不相适应的问题。这表现在某些生产环节上还有失调的现象。例如：为了提高焦炭质量，减低灰分，还需要适当补充小型的破碎和洗煤设备。在矿石破碎方面，目前有些地方还用手工破碎，不仅费工大、成本高，还常因劳力不足影响破碎质量；在矿石利用方面，各地目前存有很多粉矿还不能利用。这就需要添置少许碎矿和烧结设备，这样可以节约劳动力，降低成本；粉矿经过烧结加以利用，还可以节省矿石，改善高炉原料条件，提高高炉产量和生铁质量（烧结矿比普通矿石更好冶炼）。又如：厂内机修力量各地普遍不够，设备缺少，备件坏了不能及时检修，常常形成高炉事故多和生产不正常。厂内外运输也是一个薄弱环节，运输不及时常会造成生产不正常或发生事故。这些问题都亟待适当解决。
    江苏还常因煤的贮存量太低，造成高炉质量和产量的降低。焦煤随到随用，致使焦煤未经洗选即行炼焦，无法根据煤种进行配煤。因此，需要采取措施，保持一定的煤的贮存量。
    （二）生铁质量还需要进一步采取措施，稳步提高。这包括三个问题：一是把生铁合格率（含硫0.2％以下）进一步提高到90％以上，这是完全可以做到的。二是进一步降低生铁含硫量。江苏有个别地区和个别高炉（如苏州八十四立方公尺高炉）生铁含硫量已达到0.07％以下。硫的进一步降低，可以促使炼钢生产能力和钢质量提高，可以促使成本降低。三是小高炉生产多品种的问题。生铁大体分为炼钢生铁和铸造生铁两种，两者除共同要求硫低以外，铸造生铁要求含矽量高（1.5％到3％），而炼钢生铁要求含矽较低（转炉要求矽在1.2％左右，平炉要求1％以下）。目前江苏生铁含硫量是降低了，但随着来的是生铁含矽量的增加，含矽一般在2％到3％左右。这对铸造机器是好的，对炼钢会增加冶炼时间，并且会降低炼钢炉炉衬寿命。因此，要求小高炉生产炼钢生铁，也就要求高炉工作人员更好地掌握高炉操作技术。
    （三）生产技术方面，江苏各地小高炉的生产经验综合起来是比较完整的，加上某些外地的成功经验，组织全面推广，生产技术和经济指标进一步提高的潜力还是很大的。
    首先，在炼焦方面，全省如果推广了无锡的经验，南京、苏州等地焦炭灰分从目前的20％降到12％到14％，生铁质量、利用系数都将显著提高，焦炭也可大量节省（一般情况，焦炭灰分每降低1％，高炉产量可以增加2％）。其次，在高炉风温方面，如推广和应用多嘴燃烧加热法，风温可以从现在的五百度左右提高到六百多度；许多地方的经验说明，风温在五百多度时提高一百度，每吨生铁就可以节省焦炭一百到二百公斤。第三，在原料处理方面，有很多工厂用焙烧过的生石灰代替石灰石入炉，如能推广这一经验，也可以进一步节省焦炭，提高生铁质量。
    （四）高炉由小到大的问题。江苏现在开的高炉主要是十三和二十八立方公尺的。它们的优点是能很快地过生产技术关，供应当前的需要，但是不如大高炉经济。江苏较大的高炉多数还没有投入生产。五十五立方公尺配套齐全的有四座，开工的一座；八十四立方公尺的有二座，开工一座；二百五十五立方公尺的二座还没有开工。因此，在调整高炉布局时应当逐步停一批小型炉，充分利用较大型的高炉。在这个过程中，生产技术上的问题是如何过好中型高炉的技术关。现在开的一座五十五立方公尺的高炉，生产指标还不如十三和二十八立方公尺的高炉好；八十四立方公尺的高炉最近刚过了用土焦的关。中型高炉过好技术关是当前的任务之一。
    （五）生铁成本问题。目前，江苏的生铁成本还高。第一季度，全省平均每吨铁三百三十五元，徐州最低，每吨二百六十五元，盐城最高，每吨四百五十元。今后，进一步采取各种生产技术措施，降低焦比，减低煤耗，适当调整布局，充分利用中型高炉，成本是可以大大降低的。
