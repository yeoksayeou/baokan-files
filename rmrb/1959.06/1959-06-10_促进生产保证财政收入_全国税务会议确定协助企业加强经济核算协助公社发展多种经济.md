Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: The recent National Conference of Heads of Provincial, Municipal, and Autonomous Region Tax Bureaus determined that the current tasks of tax work are: to correctly implement tax policies, promote production development, vigorously organize revenue, and better serve socialist construction.

The conference discussed further implementing the State Council's "Regulations on Improving the Tax Administration System" and some issues in tax policy. The conference particularly emphasized the importance of correctly implementing tax policies. Because taxation has a close relationship with production, circulation, and consumption, whether taxes that should be levied are not, or taxes that should not be levied are, will have an adverse impact on the economy and finance.

Regarding the issue of levying industrial and commercial taxes on rural people's communes, the conference believed that rural people's communes are a socialist economy of collective ownership, and using taxation to incorporate a portion of the commune's accumulation into the national budget is still a relatively good and easily acceptable form for the masses. At present, rural people's communes are in a stage of consolidation and improvement, and tax work should proceed from the perspective of considering the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, which should be conducive to the consolidation of the commune and the development of production; and also conducive to national fiscal revenue and the purchase of agricultural and sideline products. Tax collection procedures should be as simple and easy as possible.

The conference pointed out that vigorously organizing enterprises to complete tax payment and profit delivery tasks in a timely manner is the most important task of the tax department.

The conference emphasized that in tax work, it is necessary to continue to implement the principle of guaranteeing financial income from developing the economy, as Chairman Mao has always pointed out. The effective experiences created by local tax departments in 1958 to promote production development should continue to be used. This year, the focus of tax work in promoting production should be on the following two aspects:

    1. Assist enterprises in strengthening economic accounting, reducing costs, and realizing production increase and economy plans. Tax cadres should start by helping enterprises improve business management, carry out technological innovations, promote advanced accounting experience, and study measures to reduce costs, in order to promote enterprises to increase production, reduce costs, and increase national income.

    2. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and in accordance with the Party's policies, assist the commune in developing diversified economies, expanding commodity exchange, and increasing commune income, thereby increasing national income.

The conference believes that in order to strengthen tax work, local tax departments should request the support of the Party committee, appropriately improve tax agencies, and replenish cadres. The conference requires all tax cadres to continue to strengthen their political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, go all out, carry out socialist labor competitions, and organize observation and inspection by the Ministry of Finance, the State Taxation Bureau, and the tax bureaus of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to promote tax work.

    促进生产保证财政收入
    全国税务会议确定协助企业加强经济核算协助公社发展多种经济
    据新华社9日讯　最近召开的全国省、市、自治区税务局长会议确定当前税收工作的任务是：正确贯彻税收政策，促进生产发展，大力组织收入，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    会议讨论了进一步贯彻国务院
  “关于改进税收管理体制的规定”和税政上的一些问题。会议特别强调正确贯彻税收政策的重要性。因为税收同生产、流通、消费有着密切的关系，无论是应当征税的没有征税，或者是不应当征税的征了税，都会对经济和财政带来不利的影响。
    对于农村人民公社征收工商税问题，会议认为农村人民公社是集体所有制的社会主义经济，通过税收把公社的一部分积累纳入国家预算，目前仍然是一种比较好的、容易为群众接受的形式。当前农村人民公社正处在巩固和提高阶段，税收工作应当从兼顾国家、集体、个人三方面的利益出发，既要有利于公社的巩固和生产的发展；又要有利于国家财政收入和农副产品收购。征收手续要尽量做到简便易行。
    会议指出，大力组织企业及时完成税收和上交利润任务，是税务部门一项最重大的工作。
    会议强调指出，在税收工作中必须继续贯彻毛主席历来指出的从发展经济来保证财政收入的方针，1958年各地税务部门创造的一些行之有效的促进生产发展的经验，应当继续运用。今年税收工作促进生产的重点应当放在以下两个方面：
    一、协助企业加强经济核算，降低成本，实现增产节约计划。税务干部应当从帮助企业改善经营管理、开展技术革新、推广先进的核算经验、研究降低成本的措施等方面入手，来促进企业增加生产，降低成本，来增加国家收入。
    二、在党委的统一领导下，根据党的政策，协助公社发展多种经济，扩大商品交换，增加公社收入，从而增加国家的收入。
    会议认为：为了加强税收工作，各地税务部门应当请求党委支持，适当健全税务机构，充实干部。会议要求全体税务干部继续加强政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，鼓足干劲，开展社会主义劳动竞赛，并由财政部、税务总局和各省、市、自治区税务局共同组织观摩检查，推动税收工作。
