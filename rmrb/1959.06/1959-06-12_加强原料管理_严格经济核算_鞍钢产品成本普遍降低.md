Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, June 11th: As a result of Anshan Iron and Steel's efforts to prioritize high-quality and high-yield production during the "Red May," the company's overall product costs decreased by 3.57 million yuan compared to the previous month, exceeding the national planned target by 1.62 million yuan.

In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's production increase and savings tasks, the company convened an advanced financial work conference in late April, promoting the formulation and implementation of various production increase and savings measures across all factories and mines. As a result, production costs in all factories and mines decreased universally in May compared to the past, and thirty-nine production units have already overfulfilled their product cost plans.

In May, many factories and mines at Anshan Iron and Steel strengthened raw material management and economic accounting, establishing and improving raw material management systems, leading to a significant reduction in raw material consumption rates. The Sintering Plant, having fully implemented on-site inspection and measurement of incoming materials in April, further strengthened raw material inventory work in May, thereby preventing raw material losses. The Chemical Plant strengthened the accounting of the quantity and quality of incoming coal, and the Ironmaking Plant strengthened raw material management, establishing systems for cleaning up vehicles after unloading and recovering lost raw materials. Large, medium-sized, and other steel rolling mills implemented on-site measurement and inspection systems for incoming materials, reducing raw material consumption and greatly increasing product yield rates compared to the past.

Many factories and mines also improved technical operations, increasing raw material utilization rates. The Ironmaking Plant, with the strong support of sintering and chemical units, earnestly implemented the operational requirements of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio in blast furnaces, and universally promoted the advanced operational experience of the No. 9 Blast Furnace. As a result, the coke ratio in May decreased significantly, saving a large amount of coke. Steel rolling mills such as the First Billet Mill, due to improved technical operations and increased yield rates, saved a total of more than 3,200 tons of steel ingots and billets throughout the month. The coking workshop of the Chemical Plant, due to improved coal blending ratios and strengthened temperature control, saved more than 7,200 tons of coking coal throughout the month. In addition, significant achievements were also made in saving fuel, power, auxiliary materials, and administrative expenses. (Attached picture)

    加强原料管理　严格经济核算
    鞍钢产品成本普遍降低
    新华社鞍山11日电　鞍钢各厂矿红五月抓紧优质高产的结果，全公司产品成本比上月降低了三百五十七万元，比国家计划指标降低一百六十二万元。
    为确保今年增产节约任务的全面完成，公司在4月下旬召开了全公司财务工作跃进大会，推动各厂矿制订并贯彻了各项增产节约措施。因此，5月份各厂矿的生产成本比过去普遍降低，并且已有三十九个生产单位超额完成了产品成本计划。
    鞍钢许多厂矿5月份都加强了原料管理和经济核算工作，建立和健全了原料管理制度，使原料消耗率显著降低。烧结总厂在4月份全面实行来料检尺计量的基础上，5月份又加强了原料盘点工作，从而防止了原料损失。化工总厂加强了来煤数量和质量的核算工作，炼铁厂加强了原料管理工作，并且都建立了卸车清扫和回收散失原料等制度。大型、中型等轧钢厂贯彻了来料量尺检查制度等等，使原料消耗比过去下降，产品收得率比过去大大提高。
    许多厂矿还改进了技术操作，提高了原料利用率。炼铁厂在烧结、化工等单位大力支援下，在高炉上认真贯彻了提高冶炼强度和降低焦比并举的操作要求，并且普遍推广了九高炉的先进操作经验，因而5月份焦比显著下降，节约大量焦炭。第一初轧厂等轧钢厂由于改进技术操作，提高了收得率，全月节约钢锭和钢坯共三千二百多吨。化工总厂炼焦车间由于改进配煤比，加强了调温工作，全月节约炼焦煤七千二百多吨。此外，在节约燃料、动力、辅助材料和行政费用等方面，也都取得了显著成绩。（附图片）
