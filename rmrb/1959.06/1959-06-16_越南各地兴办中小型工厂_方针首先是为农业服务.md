Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi dispatch: Our correspondent reports: Local industry in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has seen significant development. According to statistics, since last winter, in twenty-one out of the twenty-seven provinces in North Vietnam, more than sixty medium and small factories have been established, and they have supplied the first batch of agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers for this year's spring plowing and summer harvest.

    After the call to vigorously develop local industry was put forward last winter, each province, following the policy of "local industry serving agriculture first," built the first batch of farm tool factories, and then gradually built a batch of building material factories. Up to now, provinces have established factories for manufacturing and repairing agricultural tools, fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories. Some places have also established sugar refineries, oil presses, small iron smelting furnaces, and small hydroelectric power stations.

    The plows and harrows produced by local agricultural tool factories in Phu Tho and Hung Yen provinces can already meet the needs of the entire provinces. The plows and double-wheeled harrows produced in Thai Binh province in the first four months of this year have met the needs of most agricultural cooperatives in a timely manner.

    Most of the small factories in the provinces are funded by local finance departments, and a small portion is funded by the working people collectively. All of them use local raw materials for production.

    Most provinces in northern Vietnam are rich in resources. Vigorously developing local industry can further utilize these resources to serve the national economy. According to the provisions of the national plan, by the end of 1960, Vietnam's industrial sector must supply 600,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, 1.5 million pieces of improved agricultural tools, and several thousand water pumps. To complete this task, it is necessary to rely not only on the industrial departments under the central government but also to vigorously develop local industry.

    In order to solve the problems in developing local industry in a timely manner, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party convened a local industry conference on the 5th, attended by responsible cadres from various zones, provinces, and cities.

    Le Thanh Nghi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Minister of Industry, made a report at the meeting, calling on mobilizing the strength of the entire party and the people to vigorously develop local industry, and adhere to the central government's centralized leadership over local areas, while strengthening the division of labor and cooperation between various departments, levels, and regions.

    越南各地兴办中小型工厂
    方针首先是为农业服务
    新华社河内电　本社记者报道：越南民主共和国的地方工业已经有了显著的发展。据统计，去冬以来，在全北越的二十七个省中，已经有二十一个省建立了六十多个中小型工厂，并且为今年春耕和夏收供应了第一批农具和化学肥料。
    去年冬季提出大力发展地方工业的号召以后，各省根据“地方工业首先为农业服务”的方针，兴建了第一批农具厂，随后逐步兴建了一批建筑器材厂。到目前为止，各省已经建立了农具制造和修理厂、肥料厂和农药厂等。个别地方还建立了制糖厂、榨油厂、炼铁小高炉、小型水利发电站。
    富寿、兴安等省地方农具厂生产的犁耙已经可以满足全省的需要。太平省在今年头四个月生产的犁铧和双耙，及时满足了大部分农业合作社的需要。
    各省的小工厂大部分是由地方财政部门出资兴办的，小部分由劳动人民集资兴办，而且全部利用本地的原材料进行生产。
    越南北方大部分省份中都蕴藏着丰富的资源，大力发展地方工业，就可以进一步利用这些资源，来为国民经济服务。按照国家计划的规定，到1960年底，越南的工业部门必须供应六十万吨化学肥料、一百五十万件改良农具和几千台抽水机。要完成这个任务不仅要依靠中央所属的工业部门，同时还必须大力发展地方工业。
    为了及时解决发展地方工业中的问题，越南劳动党中央5日召开了有各区、省、市负责干部参加的地方工业会议。
    越南劳动党中央政治局委员，工业部部长黎清毅在会上作报告时，号召动员全党全民的力量大力发展地方工业，并坚持中央对地方的集中领导，同时加强各部门、各级、各地区之间的分工协作。
