Xinhua News Agency, 31st: Under the slogan of "Study hard, make progress every day," children across the country are engaging in activities to read more and better books in their spare time. These activities have enriched their learning lives, fostered a general atmosphere of reading, and provided them with valuable education in revolutionary traditions.

　　Cities such as Shanghai, Chengdu, Xi'an, Qingdao, Chongqing, and Hangzhou have all widely launched activities to encourage children to read more good books. In Xi'an, over the past two months, more than 257,000 Young Pioneers and children have each read two to five books about revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary struggles, such as "The Story of Xiang Xiuli" and "My Family." Children have established many "Red Book Recommendation Groups" and nearly ten thousand reading groups. According to statistics, children in the city have purchased as many as 120,000 copies of "My Family" alone. Combining their reading of books about revolutionary struggles, the children also visited the Exhibition Hall of the Eighth Route Army Office. In Shanghai, 420,000 children participated in the "Red Scarf Medal" and "Red Youth" reading activities, with 150,000 children receiving various awards for their good reading habits. In Yinchuan, more than 20,000 Hui and Han children launched a reading campaign to "Make Friends with Red Newspapers and Periodicals" and "Make Friends with Good Books." Children saved their pocket money to subscribe to many children's publications. Every Young Pioneer brigade in schools has established children's libraries. Some schools have even set up "Reading Classes" specifically for children, explaining the content of the books to those who cannot read. Now, a love of reading has become widespread among children in the city. Many children have read seven, eight, or even more than ten books this semester, and some schools have an average of one newspaper subscription for every one to two children. The children have also adapted some short and interesting books into dramas, operas, dances, and other performances.

　　In rural areas, some schools have set up libraries and "Red Youth Bookstores" to encourage children to read more, which are very popular with children. Gaotang People's Commune Primary School in Hu County, Shaanxi Province, has established twelve small libraries and added more than 73,000 new books. In many areas, Young Pioneer organizations, in conjunction with reading activities, also hold various storytelling sessions, report meetings, literary and art evenings, and science and technology evenings, and invite revolutionary heroes, writers, scientists, and others to meet with the children.

　　Since the launch of activities to encourage children to read more good books in various places, it has played a very good role in inspiring children to study hard and cultivating their excellent qualities. The members of the Fourth Brigade of the Young Pioneers in the Seventeenth Middle School of Xi'an City used to generally think that composition and arithmetic were the most difficult subjects and their grades were not good. However, after reading about how imprisoned revolutionary predecessors burned cotton into charcoal, mixed it with water to make ink, and used bamboo sticks as pens to write articles and persevere in their studies in the book "Eternal Life in Flames," they resolved to learn from the example of the revolutionary predecessors, organized mutual aid groups to study their lessons diligently, and now their grades have generally improved. Luo Fengying, a student at the Thirty-fifth Middle School, was recuperating at home due to illness. The Young Pioneers in her class took turns copying notes for her and relaying what the teacher said to her, so that she could continue to study while sick. Wang Shujun, a nine-year-old girl in Tianjin, developed an honest character because she often heard her teacher read stories of good deeds and heroic model figures published in the newspaper. Once, she found more than 30 yuan on the road and immediately took the money to the police station, receiving praise from the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st: While diligently studying, children in various places are actively participating in social activities and productive labor within their capacity and have made many achievements.

　　Since last spring, children across the country have widely participated in three activities: planting, eliminating the four pests, and speaking Mandarin, and have achieved great results. This spring, the activities of planting sunflowers and castor beans and other oil crops carried out by children in various places are on a larger scale than in previous years. Children in Fushun, Kangping, Wendeng, Zibo and other counties and cities in Liaoning and Shandong have planted sunflowers and castor beans along riversides, roadsides, field ridges, and in front of and behind houses.

　　After the rural people's communes were established, helping the people's communes with their work became an activity that children loved. Children in Sichuan, Fujian, Yunnan, Zhejiang and other provinces have organized grain-picking teams during the current summer harvest. The children carefully pick up grain in the fields, along the edges of fields, and in the grass piles by the roadside. Two thousand eight hundred children in Niufu Commune, Fushun County, Sichuan, picked up more than 12,500 catties of grain in two days. Children in Xi'an have recently organized more than 700 wheat protection teams and wheat picking teams to participate in the summer harvest. Children in many areas also help communes accumulate fertilizer and find feed, as well as remove insects and weeds from commune crops. Children in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, have launched an "Respect for the Elderly and Love for the Young" campaign, helping nursing homes beautify the environment, clean up, read newspapers to the elderly, and perform entertainment programs.

　　Children in various places have also carried out many activities to support industrial production. Last year, children in Chongqing launched an activity to manufacture 10,000 pieces of labor protection equipment and 10,000 pairs of straw sandals. In just two and a half months, the children overcame the difficulty of a lack of raw materials, found various substitutes, and made more than 30,000 pieces of labor protection equipment such as gloves and aprons and more than 30,000 pairs of straw sandals, which were sent to steelworkers. The Red Scarf Industrial Drought Relief Shock Brigade of Yangzixiang Primary School in Nanchang City used their spare time to collect a lot of scrap iron, which was later made into fifteen "Youth" diesel engines.

    多读好书  热爱劳动  天天向上
    千千万万小朋友在祖国社会主义乐园里迅速成长
    据新华社31日讯　各地少年儿童在“好好学习、天天向上”的口号下，正在开展一个利用课外时间多读书、读好书的活动。孩子们在这个活动中丰富了自己的学习生活，比较普遍地养成了读书的风气，并且受到了良好的革命传统教育。
    上海、成都、西安、青岛、重庆、杭州等城市，都普遍在少年儿童中开展了多读好书的活动。西安市在最近两个月中，有二十五万七千多名少先队员和少年每人都阅读了“向秀丽的故事”“我的一家”等二到五本有关革命烈士和革命斗争的书。孩子们成立了许多“红色书籍推荐组”和近万个读书小组。据统计，仅“我的一家”一书，全市的孩子们就购买了十二万册。孩子们结合阅读有关革命斗争的书籍，还参观了八路军办事处展览馆。上海市有四十二万少年儿童参加了“红领巾奖章”和“红色少年”的读书活动，其中有十五万儿童因为读书好而受到各种奖励。银川市有两万多名回汉族少年儿童开展了一个“和红色报刊交朋友”、“和好书交朋友”的读书活动。孩子们把零用钱省下来，订购了许多少年读物。各学校少先队的中队都成立了儿童图书馆。有些学校还专为儿童们设立了“读书课”，对没有阅读能力的儿童讲解书籍的内容。现在全市儿童中已经普遍养成一种爱读书的风气，许多孩子这个学期已经读了七、八本到十多本书，有些学校的儿童平均一至二人就订有一份报纸。孩子们还把读过的一些短小有趣的书，编成话剧、歌剧、舞蹈等，进行演出。
    各地农村有些学校为了让孩子们多读书，设立了图书馆和“红色少年书店”，很受儿童欢迎。陕西省鄠县高塘人民公社小学办了十二个小型图书馆，增添了七万三千多册新书。许多地区的少先队组织结合读书活动还举办各种故事会、报告会、文艺晚会、科技晚会，并邀请革命英雄、作家、科学家等和孩子们见面。
    各地在少年儿童中展开多读好书的活动以后，对鼓舞孩子们认真学习、培养孩子们的优秀品质等方面已经起了很好的作用。西安市第十七中学少先队第四中队的队员们曾经普遍认为作文和算术最难，成绩也不好，但他们在“在烈火中永生”一书里读到被囚的革命先辈把棉花烧焦用水调成墨汁、用竹签做笔写文章坚持学习的事情以后，他们决心学习革命先辈的榜样，组织了互助组认真学习功课，现在成绩普遍好转。第三十五中学学生罗凤英生病在家休养，和她同班的少先队员们便轮流替她抄笔记，把老师讲的转述给她听，使她在病中也能坚持学习。天津市九岁的女孩子王淑君因为经常听到老师读报上登载的好人好事和英雄模范人物的故事，养成了诚实的性格，一次她在路上拾到三十多元钱，她立即把钱送到派出所，受到了群众的表扬。
    据新华社31日讯　各地的少年儿童在努力读书的同时，积极参加力所能及的社会活动和生产劳动，作出了许多成绩。
    全国少年儿童去年春季以来广泛参加了种植、除四害、讲普通话的三项活动，获得很大成绩。今年春季，各地少年儿童开展的种植向日葵和蓖麻等油料作物的活动，比往年规模更大。辽宁的抚顺、康平，山东的文登、淄博等县市的少年儿童，在河边、道旁、田埂、房前屋后都种上了向日葵和蓖麻。
  农村人民公社化后，帮助人民公社做事就成为少年儿童所热爱的一项活动。四川、福建、云南、浙江等省的少年儿童在目前的夏收中都组织了拣粮队，孩子们细心地在田里田边、路旁草堆仔细拣粮。四川富顺县牛佛公社的二千八百名少年儿童在两天中就拣回粮食一万二千五百多斤。西安市的孩子们最近已组织起七百多个护麦队和拾麦队等参加夏收。许多地区的少年儿童还帮助公社积肥和寻找饲料，为公社庄稼除虫、拔草等。河北宁津县的少年儿童开展了“敬老爱幼”活动，孩子们帮助敬老院美化环境，打扫清洁，替老人读报、演出文娱节目等。
    各地少年儿童还开展许多活动来支援工业生产。重庆市的少年儿童去年开展了制造万件劳保用具和万双草鞋活动，在短短的两个半月中，孩子们克服了原材料缺乏的困难，找到了各种代用品，做成了三万多件手套、围裙等劳动用具和三万多双草鞋，送给了炼钢工人。南昌市羊子巷小学红领巾工业抗旱突击队，利用课余时间拣拾了很多废钢铁，这些废钢铁后来制成了十五台“少年号”柴油机。（附图片）
