    Hejiang Reclamation Area Sows 1.3 Million Mu of Soybeans
    (Our Newspaper News) From late April to the end of May, fourteen state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms under the Hejiang Agricultural Reclamation Bureau of Heilongjiang Province have victoriously completed the sowing of 1.3 million mu of soybeans. The sowing quality meets all technical requirements.
    This year, the various agricultural and pastoral farms in the Hejiang Reclamation Area further implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" during the soybean sowing process. In order to ensure sufficient fertilizer for soybeans, the entire reclamation area accumulated and produced more than 13.7 billion jin of various fertilizers from last winter to this spring. The vast majority of these fertilizers were applied to the soybean fields.
    Currently, the early-sown soybeans have already turned green. In order to seize the time, take the initiative, ensure full stands, and promote strong and uniform seedlings, the units that have completed soybean sowing are simultaneously rushing to sow autumn crops such as feed and grain, while also arranging and commencing summer hoeing work.

    本报讯　黑龙江省合江农垦局所属十四个国营农、牧场，从4月下旬到5月底，已经胜利地完成了一百三十万亩大豆的播种任务。播种质量全部合乎技术要求。
    今年合江垦区各农牧场在大豆播种过程中进一步贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。为了保证大豆施足肥料，去冬今春，全垦区共积制各种肥料一百三十七亿多斤。这些肥料绝大部分施在大豆地里。
    目前，早下地的大豆已经放青，为了抢时间、争主动，保苗全苗，苗壮苗齐，已经播完大豆的单位，一面抢播饲料、粮食等秋季作物，一面安排和开始了夏锄工作。　（合江农垦报）
