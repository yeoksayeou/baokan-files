    Take the Lead in Reading Good Books
    Good work and good study are the mottoes that student cadres need to keep in mind at all times. Student cadres actively respond to the Party's call, actively participate in political activities, and enthusiastically do social work. These excellent qualities always need to be promoted. At the same time, they must also be diligent in reading and studious in research, taking the lead in academic progress. If they can do this, that would be even better. Student cadres at the Beijing Institute of Technology have begun to move toward this goal. It is hoped that student cadres in other schools will also catch up quickly and set an example of being both red and expert for the majority of students.

    带头读好书
    工作好，学习也好，这是学生干部需要时时牢记的座右铭。学生干部积极响应党的号召，主动参加政治活动，热心去做社会工作，这种优秀品质永远需要发扬。同时，还要能勤奋读书，刻苦钻研，在学业上带头前进。如果能做到这样，那才是好上加好。北京工业学院的学生干部，已开始向这个目标进发了，希望其他学校的学生干部也急起直追，为广大同学树立又红又专的榜样。
