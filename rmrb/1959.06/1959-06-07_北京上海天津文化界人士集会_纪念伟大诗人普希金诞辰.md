Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: More than one thousand people from cultural circles in the capital gathered at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall today to commemorate the 160th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian poet Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin.

The commemoration was presided over by Zang Kejia, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Writers Association and a poet. In his opening remarks, he said: "The great Russian poet Pushkin was the founder of modern Russian literature. His works are brilliant, and his voice calling for freedom still rings in our ears. Through cultural exchange, his influence is growing day by day, and it is of great significance to the people of the world in their struggle for peace, freedom, and happiness."

Ge Baoquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and a director of the Chinese Writers Association, gave a report entitled "Pushkin and China" at the meeting, introducing Pushkin's life and works. He said: "Pushkin's works were among the earliest Russian literature translated into Chinese. As early as 1903, his famous novel 'The Captain's Daughter' was translated. In 1907, Mr. Lu Xun commented on Pushkin's life and works in his essay 'The Power of Mara Poetry'. In the past forty years, almost all of Pushkin's poems, prose, and dramas have been translated into Chinese. Pushkin's name is familiar to the Chinese people, and Pushkin's works are loved by the vast number of our readers. Today, as we commemorate the 160th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian poet Pushkin, we must cherish the valuable Soviet literary heritage even more, strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, and learn from and inherit the excellent Soviet cultural traditions."

Soviet Embassy in China Cultural Counselor Sudarikov also spoke at the meeting. He said: "Today's enthusiastic commemoration of the 160th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian writer Pushkin vividly confirms the Chinese people's love for Pushkin. I believe that today's commemoration will make a new contribution to consolidating the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship. This friendship is a guarantee for building our common cause."

At the meeting, film actors recited Pushkin's famous poems "To Chaadayev", "Exegi monumentum", "To Kern", and excerpts from the long poem "Eugene Onegin". The color film of the same name based on "Eugene Onegin" was also screened.
