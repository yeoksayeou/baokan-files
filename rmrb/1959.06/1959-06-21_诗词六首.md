Six Poems
Liu Yazi - Posthumous Works

Dedicated to Chairman Mao in Yan'an, and also to Comrades Lin Boqu, Wu Yuzhang, Xu Teli, Dong Biwu, and Zhang Shushi
1941

The Bridge Mausoleum of Bows and Arrows is silent and still, a wondrous flower blooms on the tree of eternity.
If the heavens permit us to share national concerns, the Cantonese sea will never forget our shared tea.
Du's decisive judgment and Fang's wise counsel labor through midnight, Jiang's writing brush and Qiu's brocade each hold their own fame.
The old men of Shangshan are glad to be healthy, their white heads together aiming to establish a glorious China.

Dedicated to General Chen Yi 1945

Combining both literary and military talents, he returns to Jiangdong to regain lost territory.
I am delighted by the good news from my hometown, the vanguard pointing directly at Yuhuatai.

Tune: Washing Brook Sand - Two Poems - 1950
On October 3rd, at Huai Ren Tang, I watched the joint performance of song and dance by the Southwest Ethnic Groups Art Troupe, the Xinjiang Art Troupe, the Jilin Yanbian Art Troupe, and the Inner Mongolia Art Troupe. Chairman Mao instructed me to fill in this verse to commemorate the grand occasion of great unity.

The fire trees and silver flowers light up the night sky, brothers and sisters dance gracefully, the singing resonates through the round moon (note).
If not for one person's leadership, how could a hundred ethnic groups gather in splendor? A joyful and unprecedented grand gathering tonight.
(Note) The Xinjiang Kazakh dance troupe has a song called "Round Moon".

Rhyming Dedication to Chairman Mao

A down-and-out scholar wears two hats, every time he composes a fine line, he dances gracefully, hoping the flowers will always be beautiful and the moon always round.
Equality and freedom lead to cooperation, the Xiongnu and Nanzhao are even more harmonious than Khotan, the fine steeds clear the way with cracking whips.

Self-Inscription after Writing Poems in the Grinding Sword Studio 1908

The sword-like state and the flute-like heart cannot be restrained, I have already betrayed my initial aspirations from time immemorial.
If I can remove hatred for stubborn stones, then being a poet is too foolish.
I only feel that high singing moves the spirits, it doesn't matter if I enter the world and face beauty and ugliness.
I am only ashamed of the scholars who sing in Luoyang, shedding tears at the New Pavilion once again.

Seeing Liao Zhongkai off to Guangdong, also presented to Madam He Xiangning
1923

The starry clouds and mountain peaks seem distant, I recognized Jingzhou as soon as we met.
He was praised as a pillar of strength in the south long ago, now he embarks on a journey from the sea.
After the war-torn Wu region is restored, the portraits will be arranged high in the Cloud Terrace.
A new copy of the wandering people, waits for her to paint again with her Xiang bamboo brush in her boudoir.

    诗词六首
    柳亚子  遗作
    寄延安毛主席兼柬林伯渠吴玉章徐特立董必武张曙时诸公
                              一九四一年
    弓箭桥陵寂不哗，万年枝上挺奇花。
    云天倘许同忧国，粤海难忘共品茶。
    杜断房谋劳午夜，江毫丘锦各名家。
    商山诸老欣能健，头白相期奠夏华。
    寄陈毅将军一九四五年
    兼资文武此全才，重向江东卷土来。
    我喜故乡消息好，前锋直指雨花台。
    浣溪纱　二首　一九五○年
    十月三日，于怀仁堂观西南各民族文工团、新疆文工团、吉林省延边文工团、内蒙文工团联合演出歌舞晚会，毛主席命填是阕，用纪大团结之盛况云尔。
    火树银花不夜天，弟兄姊妹舞翩?，歌声唱澈月儿圆（注）。不是一人能领导，那容百族共骈阗？良宵盛会喜空前。
        （注）新疆哈萨克族歌舞团有圆月一歌。
    叠韵呈毛主席
    落魄书生戴二天，每吟佳句舞翩?，愿花长好月长圆。平等自由成合作，匈奴南诏更于阗，骅骝开道着鞭前。
    自题磨剑室诗词后　一九○八年
    剑态箫心不可羁，已教终古负初期。
    能为顽石方除恨，便作词人亦太痴。
    但觉高歌动精鬼，不妨入世任妍媸。
    只惭洛下书生咏，洒泪新亭又一时。
    送廖仲恺归粤兼呈何香凝夫人
                              一九二三年
    星云山斗望中遥，才识荆州便故交。
    早向天南称柱石，恰从海上送征轺。
    疮痍吴地来苏后，图象云台列宿高。
    一幅流民新粉本，闺中湘管待重描。
