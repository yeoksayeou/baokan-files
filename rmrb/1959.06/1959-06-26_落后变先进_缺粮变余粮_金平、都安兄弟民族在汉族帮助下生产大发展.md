Our report (Zhang Chunhu): Yunnan Province's Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture's Jinping County's minority nationalities, under the leadership of the Party and with the active assistance of Han cadres and masses, have leapt from the backward state of slash-and-burn farming and extensive cultivation to the advanced ranks of the country. The average yield per mu in the county has reached nearly a thousand jin, and the average grain possession per person is over sixteen hundred jin. Due to the rapid advancements in agricultural production, in 1958, it was awarded the glorious title of National Advanced Agricultural County.

Jinping County is a multi-ethnic area on the south bank of the Honghe River on the southwestern border. Of the county's more than 130,000 people, over 90% are minority nationalities such as Hani, Zhuang, Yi, Yao, Miao, Dai, and Kucong. The area has high mountains, abundant water, and fertile soil, and the subtropical climate is suitable for growing a variety of crops year-round. However, under the ethnic oppression and the exploitation of the feudal Tusi system in the past, productivity could not develop. For a long time, farming was extensive and yields were low, with no fertilizer applied. Most of the Miao, Yao, and Kucong people living in the mountainous areas were still in the slash-and-burn stage of shifting cultivation. The working people of all ethnic groups lived a poor life.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, hundreds of outstanding Han cadres were sent from the interior over the years to help the various minority nationalities develop production, trade, and cultural and educational hygiene. The People's Government also distributed a large amount of relief funds and loans. Statistics from nineteen townships in the mountainous area alone show that from 1951 to 1956, more than 310,000 yuan of various production relief funds were distributed free of charge, and 570,000 yuan in low-interest loans were provided. In order to cultivate ethnic minority cadres and further develop production, Party committees at all levels have also widely disseminated advanced production experience through training classes and on-site meetings over the years, and organized many ethnic minority visiting groups to go deep into various parts of the country to learn advanced technologies.

In the past, many people said, "Wheat cannot be grown in subtropical areas." After representatives of various ethnic groups visited a piece of autumn wheat in the Provincial Agricultural Exhibition Hall in Kunming, they all asked the county party committee to help solve the problem of wheat seeds and planting technology when they returned to the county. Through many on-site meetings, Han cadres provided hands-on demonstrations and guided them to adopt advanced methods, and they sowed more than 12,000 mu of wheat for the first time. This year, the yield generally reached about 300 jin, delighting the Hani people, who said, "From now on, our minority nationalities have learned to eat two crops (referring to rice and wheat)." The farming techniques of the various ethnic groups have been improving step by step, and grain production has increased year by year. After some areas of the county implemented mutual aid and cooperation through peaceful consultation land reform in 1956 and some areas adopted direct transition methods, agricultural production developed even faster. Within two years, the yield jumped from more than 500 jin to nearly 1,000 jin. While grain production has increased, sideline production has also greatly developed. According to statistics from February of this year, the county has nearly 50,000 head of cattle, horses, and draft animals, and more than 65,000 head of large and small pigs, an increase of about 100% compared with the early days of liberation. The working people of all ethnic groups who used to suffer from hunger and starvation are now self-sufficient in staple and non-staple foods and have a surplus. To thank the Party and the Han people for their help, they actively support urban residents in the interior with their surplus grain and non-staple foods. In the first quarter of the county, more than 1,500 live pigs have been delivered, 10 million jin of grain, and 500,000 jin of brown sugar have been shipped out.

Our report: Two folk songs from Du'an Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi, describe the contrast between the past and the present. The folk songs express the heartfelt wishes of the Yao, Zhuang, and Han people of Du'an:

"It is difficult to plant on mountains and slopes, and water and soil are lost every year;
Cultivating in a jumble of rocks, a year of hard work yields nothing."

"Green mountains and clear waters fill the fields, water conservancy forms a spider web;"
Not a bit of water and soil is lost, the weather is good and the land is fertile."

Du'an Yao Autonomous County is a large mountainous area. Due to the dense stone mountains, the county's cultivated land area accounts for only 8.45% of the total area. People use the phrase "nine parts stone, one part soil" to describe the natural landscape here. Most of the arable land here is small plots of hillside land. Therefore, soil erosion in this county is very serious. It is also very difficult for the masses to get water. In the past, 30,000 to 40,000 people in the county often climbed mountains and ridges to carry water for drinking from more than a dozen miles away. Therefore, solving the problem of water and soil is a major event that people of all ethnic groups have been thinking about day and night for generations.

After the establishment of the autonomous county in November 1955, the first thing it did was to lead the people of all ethnic groups in digging wells and ponds to get water from the mountains and underground. The ethnic work team, carrying a large number of water conservancy loans and relief funds issued by the government, traveled all over the deep stone mountains, went deep into the Yao mountain villages, propagated ethnic policies, investigated and understood the sufferings of the masses, and helped the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas solve the difficulty of drinking water. With the strong assistance of the government, the people of all ethnic groups in the county have successively built more than 4,900 water ponds and wells, achieving the goal of every village having ponds and wells, and drinking water without leaving the village, basically solving the drinking water problem for people and animals in the county.

After the drinking water problem was solved, the CPC Du'an Yao Autonomous County Committee issued a battle call to the 560,000 Yao, Zhuang, Han and other ethnic groups in the county: "Ask for grain from water and soil, take money from the mountains, store water as if storing grain, and protect soil as if protecting life." Since then, a large-scale water and soil conservation movement has been quickly launched. An army of 150,000 laborers led by more than 300 cadres, including the county magistrate and the county party secretary, immediately went into battle. The movement started in the winter of 1957, and up to now, the county has completed more than 380,000 mu of water and soil conservation tasks, including more than 60,000 mu of terraced fields, more than 820,000 mu of afforestation, and more than 100,000 large and small water conservancy, flood control and drainage projects, effectively preventing soil erosion throughout the mountainous area. The newly built stone-edged terraced fields stretch from the foot of the mountain to the hillside layer by layer, and each block is flat and solid. The original barren mountains are now covered with green clothes, and the tamed river water flows day and night along the newly built water conservancy project.

The successful realization of water and soil conservation work, and the establishment and consolidation of the people's communes, have powerfully promoted the development of agricultural production. Last year, the county's food crops achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a total grain output of more than 370 million jin, an average yield of 570 jin per mu, an increase of nearly 100% compared with 1957. Du'an has always been a county with the most grain shortages. After liberation, the state has annually transferred large quantities of grain from Yunnan, Guizhou, and various parts of the autonomous region. After last year's bumper harvest, the county's grain is self-sufficient and there is a surplus. This spring, for the first time in history, more than 8 million jin of grain were transferred out. In order to celebrate this great change that they had not experienced for thousands of years, the Yao people specially erected a stone monument with the words "Don't forget Chairman Mao in the harvest" to express the Yao people's gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now, they are happily welcoming their ethnic festival - Danu Festival. (Liu Yuanxiu Li Yufang)

    落后变先进　缺粮变余粮
    金平、都安兄弟民族在汉族帮助下生产大发展
    本报讯　记者张春虎报道：云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州金平县少数民族在党的领导下获得了汉族干部、群众的积极帮助，全县农业生产已由刀耕火种、粗耕粗种的落后状态，跃进到全国的先进行列。全县平均亩产已达到近千斤，每人平均有粮一千六百斤以上。由于农业生产上的突飞猛进，1958年获得了全国农业先进县的光荣称号。
    金平县是西南边境红河南岸一个多民族地区。全县十三万多人，其中哈尼、僮、彝、瑶、苗、傣、苦聪等少数民族占90％以上。境内山高水多地质肥沃，又属于亚热带气候，大部地区常年适合多种作物成长。但在过去民族压迫和封建土司制度的压榨下，生产力得不到发展，长期都是粗耕粗种，不施肥，广种薄收，住在山区的苗族、瑶族、苦聪族等大部分还处在不定居的刀耕火种阶段，各族劳动人民都过着贫苦的生活。
    解放后，在党的领导下，几年来先后由内地派来了数百名优秀汉族干部，帮助各少数民族发展生产、贸易和文教卫生事业。人民政府还发放了大批救济款和贷款。仅山区十九个乡统计，1951年至1956年就无偿发放各种生产救济款三十一万多元，低息贷款五十七万元。各级党委为了培养民族干部，进一步发展生产，历年还通过训练班和现场会议广泛传授先进生产经验，并组织不少民族访问团深入全国各地学习先进技术。
    过去，很多人都说“亚热带地区不能种小麦”，各族代表在昆明参观了省农业展览馆的一块秋小麦后，回到县里都要求县委帮助解决小麦种子和播种技术。通过多次现场会议，由汉族干部包教示范，并指导他们采用先进方法，第一次播种小麦一万二千多亩。今年产量普遍达到三百斤左右，乐得哈尼族人民说：“从今以后，我们少数民族都学会了吃两发了（指水稻和小麦）。”各族人民的耕作技术步步得到提高，年年粮食都增产。从1956年全县一部分地区经过和平协商土地改革，一部分地区采取直接过渡办法实现了互助合作化后，农业生产发展更快，两年之内产量就由五百多斤跃进到接近千斤的水平。在粮食增产的同时，副业生产也有很大发展。截至今年2月的统计，全县已有牛马耕畜近五万头，大小生猪六万五千多头，比解放初期增长一倍左右。过去受饥挨饿的各族劳动人民，现在主、副食品已经自给自足，还有剩余。为感谢党与汉族人民的帮助，他们积极地把多余的粮食和副食品支援内地城市居民。全县第一季度已上调生猪一千五百多头，调出粮食一千万斤，红糖五十万斤。
    本报讯　广西都安瑶族自治县，有两首山歌描述了今昔的对比。山歌唱出了都安瑶、僮、汉各族人民的心声：
    “山地坡地难种植，年年水土挨流失；
    乱石丛中来耕种，辛苦一年无收成。”
    “青山绿水满垌场，水利结成蜘蛛网；”
    一点水土不流失，风调雨顺好地方。”
    都安瑶族自治县，是一个大山区。由于石山密布，全县耕地面积仅占总面积的8.45％。人们有用“九分石头一分土”的词句来形容这里的自然面貌。这里可耕种的土地大部分是小块的山坡地。因此这个县水土流失十分严重。群众吃水也很困难。过去全县每天经常有三、四万人翻山越坳到十几里路以外挑水吃。因此，解决水及土的问题，就是各族人民日思夜想、祖祖辈辈所渴望的一件大事。
    1955年11月自治县成立后，第一件事就是领导各族人民打井挖塘，向山上地下要水。民族工作队带着政府发放的大批水利贷款和救济款，踏遍了石山深?，深入瑶族山村，边宣传民族政策，边调查了解群众的疾苦，帮助山区各族人民解决饮水困难。全县各族人民在政府的大力协助下，先后建成水塘水井四千九百多处，实现村村有塘有井，吃水不出村，基本上解决了全县人畜的饮水问题。
    饮水问题解决后，中共都安瑶族自治县委员会就向全县五十六万瑶、僮、汉等各族人民发出了“向水土要粮，向山上取钱，蓄水如蓄粮，保土如保命”的战斗号召。从此，一个大规模的水土保持运动很快就掀起来了。由县长、县委书记等三百多名干部分别率领的十五万劳动大军立即投入战斗。运动从1957年冬开始，到现在，全县共完成三十八万多亩的水土保持任务，其中整修梯田六万多亩，植树造林八十二万多亩，兴修大小水利和防洪排涝工程十万多处，有效地制止了整个山区的水土流失。新砌的石边梯田，一层层由山脚直伸到山腰，块块平整坚固，原来的童山秃岭，现在都披上了绿装，被驯服的河水，顺着新建的水利工程，日夜奔流不息。
    水土保持工作的胜利实现，和人民公社的建立与巩固，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。去年全县的粮食作物获得空前大丰收，粮食总产量达到三亿七千多万斤，平均每亩产五百七十斤，比1957年增产将近一倍。都安历来是一个缺粮最多的县，解放后每年都由国家从云南、贵州和自治区各地调进大批粮食。经过去年的大丰收，全县粮食自给还有余，今年春天有史以来第一次调出粮食八百多万斤。瑶族人民为了庆祝他们这个几千年没有过的大变化，他们特地树起了一块石碑，上面写着“丰收不忘毛主席”七个大字，表达瑶族人民对共产党和毛主席的感激。现在，他们正在高高兴兴地迎接自己的民族节日——达努节。（刘远修　李玉芳）
