Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd. People's communes in cotton-producing areas of Liaoning Province are vigorously strengthening cotton field management, striving for "full seedlings on every mu and strong seedlings on every plot."

This year, Liaoning Province planted 3,086,000 mu of cotton, exceeding the state plan. In order to ensure full seedlings on every mu and strong seedlings on every plot, cotton farmers in various places are actively inspecting fields and replanting seedlings. After the cotton sowing in Lingchuan People's Commune in Chaoyang County, cotton seedling protection training classes were immediately held for cadres in each management area and production team. During the cotton seedling soil shoveling, more than 40 cadres and experienced old farmers from the commune, work area, and production team were organized to check all cotton fields in the township team by team and plot by plot. For cotton fields with poor emergence, the causes were studied on the spot and remedies were carried out, so as to discover and remedy each plot in a timely manner. After holding a field inspection and seedling replanting meeting in Panshan County, the county immediately organized more than 8,500 people to inspect, replant, and rescue at the same time. More than 11,000 mu of cotton seedlings damaged by wind were rescued, and more than 2,300 mu were replanted. Yingkou, Gai and other counties organized forces to plant one mu and check one mu, replanting one seedling if one was missing, and launched a seedling protection movement with the spirit of not wasting every inch of land and striving for every seedling.

At present, cotton areas with better seedling emergence are seizing the time to weed, thin, and finalize seedlings. Cotton fields with weak seedlings are being top-dressed with fertilizers in addition to timely thinning, weeding, and replanting. Some dry cotton fields in Luda and Chaoyang are also being irrigated in conjunction with topdressing.

Our newspaper, Xinxiang, 4th. In mid-May, the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to the vast people in the cotton area to "produce more pre-autumn bolls and vigorously protect autumn bolls." Under the careful management of cotton farmers, the 3,930,000 mu of cotton fields in the region have full and strong seedlings, early development, and good growth. The survey on May 31st proved that the cotton in general fields this year has generally grown four or five true leaves, and the high-yield squares have reached five or six true leaves, which is two or three true leaves more per plant than in the same period last year. Some high-yield squares began to bud in late May, a few days earlier than in previous years.

Producing more pre-autumn bolls and vigorously protecting autumn bolls is the basis for striving for a greater cotton harvest this year. In order to achieve this goal, the vast number of cotton farmers in Xinxiang Prefecture are actively implementing the yield-increasing measures proposed by the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee. The seedling setting implemented "three carries": carry a ruler to ensure reasonable seedling retention; carry a basket to take the thinned cotton seedlings out of the field to prevent the spread of diseases and insect pests; carry a medicine bag to spray medicine on insect-infested plants at any time. At present, except for some alkaline land, the seedling setting work in the whole region has basically ended. When setting seedlings, various places have determined different reasonable close planting ranges according to local conditions.

From the time half of the seedlings emerged from the soil, the dream flowers were hoeed. By the end of May, cotton fields in the whole region had been hoeed twice, and more than 50% had been hoeed three times. High-yield squares have begun to be hoeed four times. Therefore, large areas of cotton fields have achieved the requirements of no weeds and no hardening.

At the same time, the first battle against cotton aphids in the whole region has basically ended. Inspired by the slogan "Protecting seedlings is like protecting life, and treating aphids is like killing enemies," the 300,000-strong pest control army controlled more than 3 million mu within a week, reducing the aphid-infested plant rate to below 3%, creating conditions for early cotton budding.

    力争亩亩苗全块块苗壮
    辽宁棉区种一亩、查一亩；缺一棵、补一棵
    河南新乡地区合理留苗，勤除杂草，防治虫害
    新华社沈阳3日电　辽宁省各产棉区人民公社大力加强棉花田间管理，力争“亩亩苗全、块块苗壮”。
    今年辽宁省植棉三百零八万六千亩，超额完成国家计划。为了保证亩亩苗全，块块苗壮，各地棉农积极查田补苗。朝阳县凌川人民公社在棉花播种结束后，立即举办了各管理区、生产队干部的棉花保苗训练班。在棉苗铲土时，组织社、作业区、生产队干部和有经验的老农四十多人，分组对全乡所有的棉田逐队逐块检查。对出苗较差的棉田，就地研究原因和进行补救，作到发现一块及时补救一块。盘山县在召开查田补苗会议后，全县立即组织八千五百多人，边查、边补、边抢救，已抢救出受风剥的棉苗一万一千多亩，补种了二千三百多亩。营口、盖平等县组织力量种一亩、查一亩，缺一棵、补一棵，以寸土不闲，棵苗必争的劲头展开了保苗运动。
    目前，出苗较好的棉区，正在抓紧锄草、间苗、定苗。幼苗生育较弱的棉田，除及时疏苗、锄草、补苗外，正分别补施肥料。旅大、朝阳部分干旱棉田，结合追肥，还进行了灌溉。
    本报新乡4日电　中共河南新乡地委5月中旬向棉区广大人民发出了“多结伏前桃，大力保伏桃”的号召，全区三百九十三万亩棉田，在棉农精心管理下，苗全苗壮，发育早，长的好。5月31日的调查证明，今年的棉花一般大田已普遍生长出四、五片真叶，丰产方已达五、六片真叶，较去年同期每株多长二、三片真叶。部分丰产方已于5月下旬开始现蕾，较往年提前了几天。
    多结伏前桃，大力保伏桃，是力争今年棉花更大丰收的基础。为了达到这个目的，新乡专区广大棉农正在积极贯彻执行新乡地委提出的增产措施。定苗的时候实行了三带：带尺，保证合理留苗；带篮，将间下的棉苗带出地外，防止病虫害传染；带药袋，发现虫株随时喷药。现在除部分碱地外，全区定苗工作已基本结束。定苗时，各地因地制宜的确定了不同的合理密植幅度。
    从苗出土一半，即开始锄梦花，到5月底全区棉田普锄了两遍，三遍的已达50％以上。丰产方已开始锄四遍。因此大片棉田实现了无草无板结的要求。
    与此同时，全区防治棉蚜的第一战役已基本结束，三十万治虫大军在“保苗如保命，治蚜如杀敌”的口号鼓舞下，一周内就防治三百余万亩，将有蚜株率压低到3％以下，为棉花早现蕾创造了条件。
