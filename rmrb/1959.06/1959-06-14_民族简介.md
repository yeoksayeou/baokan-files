Of the more than two million minority people in the frontier of Yunnan, there are 1.7 million people in areas that had entered feudal lord society before liberation. These areas include more than ten ethnic groups. The main ethnic groups are:

    Dai

    "Dai" means "free," and some say it means "plow," which is extended to mean "plowers."

    There are more than 500,000 Dai people in Yunnan, mainly living in the Xishuangbanna and Dehong Autonomous Prefectures. The Dai people settled in the southwestern border of Yunnan more than two thousand years ago.

    The Dai people have a rich cultural and artistic tradition. They use the Dai language to record scientific achievements in history, astronomy, calendar, mathematics, medicine, water conservancy projects, and have written vast literary works. The Dai people generally believe in Theravada Buddhism, and their festivals are mostly related to religion. The main festivals are Jingbimai (New Year), the Water Splashing Festival, etc.

    Hani

    There are more than 500,000 Hani people in Yunnan, mainly living in the Ailao Mountains on the south bank of the Honghe River. For a long time, the Hani people have lived with the Han, Yi, Dai and other ethnic groups, forming close fraternal relations.

    Hard work and bravery are the characteristics of the Hani people. They have transformed the Ailao Mountains into a "land of fish and rice where mountains are high and rivers are long."

    The Hani people have continuously launched armed struggles against Tusi and reactionary officials for more than 100 years, but they were only liberated after the birth of New China.

    Lahu

    "Lahu" means "hunting tigers," according to legend, they were originally nomadic tribes in northern China, and later settled in the border of Yunnan.

    The Lahu area west of the Lancang River established the Lancang Lahu Autonomous County in 1953. Today, the Lahu people still maintain the tradition of hunting.

    The Lahu people had no written language in the past. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yunnan Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission helped create a written language.

    Achang

    The Achang people live in the Hulas River Valley in the Gaoligong Mountains in western Yunnan. Their handicrafts are very developed, especially in the manufacture of ironware. The long knives and farm tools made by the Achang working people are very famous in the border areas of Yunnan.

    Achang men like tattoos and believe in Theravada Buddhism. They have frequent economic exchanges with the nearby Dai and Han people, and their living customs are similar to those of the Dai and Han people. (With pictures)

    民族简介
    云南边疆二百多万少数民族中，有一百七十万人口的地区，在解放前已进入封建领主社会。这些地区包括十多种民族。主要的民族是：
    傣族
    “傣”意为“自由”，也有说是“犁”，引申为“犁田的人”。
    云南境内的傣族共五十多万人，主要聚居在西双版纳和德宏两个自治州内。两千多年前傣族就定居在云南西南边疆。
    傣族具有丰富的文化艺术传统。他们用傣文记载着历史、天文、历法、数学、医学、水利工程等方面的科学成就，写成了浩瀚的文学作品。傣族人民普遍信仰小乘佛教，他们的节日也多与宗教有关，主要节日有京比迈（新年）、泼水节等。
      ☆     ☆     ☆
    哈尼族
    哈尼族在云南境内有五十多万人，主要聚居在红河南岸的哀牢山中。长期以来哈尼族同汉、彝、傣等族杂居，形成了亲密的兄弟关系。
    勤劳勇敢是哈尼族人民的特性，他们把哀牢山区变成了“山有多高，水有多长，山高水长，鱼米之乡”。
    哈尼族人民在近一百多年来不断爆发反抗土司和反动官府的武装斗争，但到新中国诞生以后，他们才获得了解放。
      ☆       ☆      ☆
    拉祜族
      “拉祜”是“猎食猛虎”的意思，相传他们原来是我国北方的游牧部落，以后定居在云南边疆。
    澜沧江以西的拉祜族聚居区一九五三年成立了澜沧拉祜族自治县。今天，拉祜族依然保持着打猎的传统。
    拉祜族过去没有文字。中国科学院和云南省民族事务委员会帮助创制了文字。
      ☆       ☆       ☆
    阿昌族
    阿昌族居住在云南西部高黎贡山余脉的户拉萨河谷里，手工业非常发达，尤其擅长制造铁器。阿昌劳动人民所制的长刀和农具，在云南边疆是十分驰名的。
    阿昌族男子喜欢纹身，信仰小乘佛教。他们同附近的傣族和汉族经济交往频繁，生活习俗多与傣族、汉族相近。（附图片）
