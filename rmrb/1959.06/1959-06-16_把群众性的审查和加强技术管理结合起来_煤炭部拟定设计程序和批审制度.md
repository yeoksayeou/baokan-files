Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 15th: The Ministry of Coal Industry recently held a National Coal Mine Design Work Conference in Wuhan to discuss the issue of further improving the quality of coal mine design and comprehensively implementing the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

The meeting believed that in the past few years, especially during the Great Leap Forward last year, coal mine design work, under the correct leadership of the Party, with the help of Soviet experts and the joint efforts of design personnel, has achieved great success and accumulated a lot of experience and design data. At present, it is necessary to better combine mass movements with technical management to overcome the shortcomings of some design documents being oversimplified and design quality not being high. The meeting emphasized that in the future, it is necessary to strengthen the Party committee's review of overall plans and design schemes, and the practice of mass review of designs under the leadership of the Party committee should be well combined with technical management work.

After full discussion, the meeting formulated technical management systems, design work procedures, and design document review methods. Regarding the approval of design documents, it was decided to adopt a method in which the responsible approval unit convenes relevant parties such as design, construction, and construction units to review and approve a batch of design documents at one time. This approval method can enable leading organs and design units to jointly study and solve problems, enable the design, construction, and production departments to exchange opinions in a timely manner, and achieve a combination of design review and experience exchange.

Based on the practice of the past few years and China's current economic and technical conditions, the meeting discussed and revised the original coal mine design technical guidelines in detail, and added design technical guidelines for open-pit coal mining and coal washing plants, making the technical guidelines for guiding coal mine design work more comprehensive and more in line with China's specific conditions.

During the meeting, 279 kinds of design materials were exchanged by profession, and more than 1,200 single-item engineering design drawings were introduced in the form of an exhibition. Through a combination of theoretical and practical discussions, the policy thinking and design technical level of the design personnel were further improved, which prepared the conditions for the standardization and generalization of many single-item projects.

This meeting was held from May 25th to June 6th. Participants included the presidents, chief engineers, and professional designers of coal mine design institutes affiliated to the Ministry of Coal Industry and provinces and autonomous regions. (Attached picture)

    把群众性的审查和加强技术管理结合起来
    煤炭部拟定设计程序和批审制度
    新华社武汉15日电　煤炭工业部最近在武汉召开全国煤矿设计工作会议，讨论了进一步提高煤矿设计质量，全面贯彻多快好省建设方针的问题。
    会议认为，几年来，特别是在去年大跃进中，煤矿设计工作在党的正确领导下，在苏联专家的帮助和设计人员的共同努力下，取得了很大成绩，并且积累了不少经验和设计资料。目前需要把群众运动与技术管理更好地结合起来，以克服一些设计文件过分简化、设计质量不高的缺点。会议强调指出，今后必须加强党委对总体规划和设计方案的审核工作，党委领导的群众性的审查设计的做法要和技术管理工作很好地结合起来。
    会议经过充分讨论，拟订了技术管理制度、设计工作程序和设计文件审核办法等。关于设计文件的审批，决定采用由负责审批的单位，召集设计、施工和建设单位等有关方面，对一批设计文件一次审核批准的办法。采取这样的审批办法，既可以使领导机关和设计单位共同研究解决问题，又可以使设计、施工和生产部门三方面及时交换意见，同时还可以收到审核设计和交流经验相结合的效果。
    会议根据几年来的实践和我国当前的经济技术条件，详细讨论和修订了原来的煤矿设计技术方向，增订了露天采煤、洗煤厂等设计技术方向，使指导煤矿设计工作的技术方向更加全面，更加切合我国的具体情况。
    会议期间，还按专业交流了二百七十九种设计资料，用展览的形式介绍了一千二百多件单项工程设计图纸。通过虚实结合的讨论，进一步提高了设计人员的政策思想和设计技术水平，为很多单项工程的标准化、定型化准备了条件。
    这次会议是5月25日到6月6日举行的。参加会议的，有煤炭工业部和省、自治区所属的煤矿设计院的院长、总工程师和专业设计人员。（附图片）
