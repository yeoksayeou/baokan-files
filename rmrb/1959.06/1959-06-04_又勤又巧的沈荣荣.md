Shen Rongrong, a "Five-Good" commune member of the Second Production Team of the Third Brigade of the Baimao Commune, has created high labor efficiency, and the news has spread throughout Changshu like a warm early summer breeze.

Recently, in the labor over-quota competition launched by the Baimao Commune, Rongrong was once again named the commune's "Labor Champion" for having the highest labor efficiency since the beginning of the year, becoming a "pace-setter" in exceeding labor quotas.

In mid-May, the reporter visited this respected "Labor Champion." I found Deputy Captain Zhou Chuangen in the Second Team's public canteen, eating lunch. Rongrong had not yet returned from the fields. Chuangen spoke to me about Rongrong, from how Rongrong suffered before liberation to how several poor peasant households started mutual aid teams, talking about Rongrong's hardworking and enduring spirit and his virtue of loving the collective as his own home. He said, "Rongrong just doesn't like to talk much, but he works more solidly than anyone else, and no one can match his cleverness..."

It was a clear and bright morning when Rongrong, Chuangen, Zhou Yuanyuan, and three female commune members rowed a large boat, carrying about 10,000 catties, to Pangjia Dam by the Yangtze River to cut green grass. Male commune members took turns rowing, while the women sat on the boat weaving lace. Could they not do anything during the thirty-mile waterway journey? Rongrong had already planned it out. He carried a bundle of rice straw on the boat, and when it was his turn to rest, he twisted the straw into ropes to make straw sandals. As they approached their destination, Rongrong sharpened his sickle again and tidied up his carrying pole. As soon as the boat docked, he was the first to jump ashore. The riverbank was covered with green grass a dozen feet tall, and many people came here to cut grass. Rongrong picked a place with a lot of grass and squatted down, cutting away with a "hu-chi, hu-chi" sound. He was not only quick, but also sharp-eyed. As he cut this patch of grass, he already had his eye on the next. He walked and cut; once this patch was cleared, he carried the pile of grass to the next, so he didn't have to run around collecting piles of grass. When Rongrong carried a heavy load of green grass onto the boat, others hadn't even cut one load yet.

In the evening, when evaluating work points, Rongrong shared his grass-cutting experience with everyone. By learning Rongrong's clever method, the amount of grass cut the next day increased significantly. The work efficiency of the male commune members caught up with Rongrong, and the three female commune members also exceeded the basic labor quota of cutting 400 catties of green grass per day. This time, everyone completed the task of cutting 10,000 catties of green grass one day ahead of schedule.

In two days, Rongrong cut a total of 1,633 catties of grass and twisted 100 tuos of straw rope. According to the progressive reward system for labor remuneration implemented in the team, Rongrong earned sixty-seven work points.

Chuangen and Rongrong are experts at dredging river mud (i.e., scooping up river mud), and no one in the Third Brigade can keep up with them. One day, it was their turn to dredge river mud again. Chuangen got up at four o'clock in the morning. He planned to check the tools and oars on the boat first, and then go call Rongrong. When he arrived at the pond, Rongrong was already waiting for him on the boat. Rongrong had tidied up the mud-dredging and rowing tools the night before. However, there was an extra bundle of straw mats on the boat, and Chuangen couldn't figure out what they were for. The boat rowed towards Xie Liu Jing. Along the way, they discussed how to break the red flag labor quota of dredging five boatloads of river mud. Rongrong said, "Today the wind is light, and there are no waves in the small rivers. Let's dredge together, and we guarantee we can break the quota." He also came up with a clever idea, which was for one person to manage one side and lower the dredging net at the same time, so the boat wouldn't shake.

"This method is brilliant!" Chuangen exclaimed while dredging mud. As the boat was about to be filled, Chuangen put down the dredging net and picked up the oar to row the boat back. "Are you leaving before it's full?" Rongrong stopped Chuangen. "There's no place to put it!" Chuangen said, pointing to the full boatload of mud. At this time, Rongrong inserted the straw mats he had brought into the river mud, like folds for storing grain, and said to Chuangen, "Isn't this a place?" Chuangen admired Rongrong's clever idea from the bottom of his heart. In this way, one boatload was equivalent to two, saving them a trip of more than two miles back and forth. That day, they dredged a total of seven boatloads of river mud, breaking the red flag labor quota, and Rongrong earned twenty-eight work points.

Shen Rongrong used this method of solid work plus clever work to improve labor efficiency. According to the team's work point calculator, from the beginning of this year to May 10, Rongrong worked a total of 358 workdays, averaging 2.7 workdays per day.

    又勤又巧的沈荣荣

    白茆公社第三大队第二生产小队“五好”社员沈荣荣创造了高工效的消息，像初夏的暖风一样吹遍了整个常熟。
    最近，在白茆公社开展的劳动超定额的竞赛中，荣荣又因为今年以来劳动工效最高，被评为全公社的“劳动状元”，成为劳动超定额的“标兵”。
    5月中旬，记者访问了这位被人们尊敬的“劳动状元”。在二小队的公共食堂里，我找到了副队长周传根同志，他在吃午饭。这时荣荣在田里还没有回来，传根同我谈起了荣荣。他从解放前荣荣如何受苦谈到几户贫农开始搞互助组的情形，谈到了荣荣刻苦耐劳的精神，爱社如家的美德。他说：“荣荣就是不爱多讲话，但做起活来比谁都扎实，巧心眼更没有人比得过他……。”
    是一个晴明清朗的早晨，荣荣、传根、周元元和三个女社员，摇着一条载重万把斤的大船，到长江边的庞家坝去割青草。男社员轮流负责摇橹，妇女们坐在船上织花边。三十里水路能不做事吗？荣荣早就有了打算，他背了一捆稻草放在船上，轮他休息的时候，就搓起草绳来打草鞋。快到目的地了，荣荣把镰刀又磨了一遍，收拾了挑子，等船一靠，他第一个跳上岸。江滩上长满了丈把长的青草，到这里来割草的人很多。荣荣捡了一块草多的地方蹲下来，呼赤呼赤地割起来了。他不仅手快，眼也尖。割这块草地的时候，他就看好了下一块。走一路，割一路；这块割光了，就把草堆背到下一块去，这样就不要东跑西奔去收拾草堆了。当荣荣挑着沉沉的一担青草上船时，别人还没有割到一担呢。
    晚上，在评记工分的时候，荣荣向大家介绍了自己的割草经验。由于学习了荣荣的巧办法，第二天割草的数量大大增加了，男社员的工效都赶上了荣荣，三个女社员也都突破了每天割青草四百斤的基本劳动定额。这一次，大家提前一天完成了割青草一万斤的任务。
    在两天时间里，荣荣共割草一千六百三十三斤，搓草绳一百托。按照队内实行的劳动报酬累进奖励制规定，荣荣得工分六十七个。
    传根和荣荣是罱河泥（即捞河泥）的老手，在三大队里没人能赶上他们。有一天，又轮到他们两人去罱河泥了。早晨四点多钟，传根就起身了。他打算先去检查船上的工具和橹棒，然后去叫荣荣。当他到塘边时，荣荣却已经在船上等他了，罱泥和摇船工具荣荣在昨天晚上就收拾好了。不过，船上多了一捆草帘子，传根一时还想不到做什么用。船向谢六泾摇去。一路上他们在商量着如何突破罱五舱河泥的红旗劳动定额。荣荣说：“今天风小，小河浜里没风浪，我们两个人一道罱吧，保证能突破定额。”他还想到了一个巧办法，就是一人管一边，同时下罱网，船就不会晃动了。
    “这办法灵透了！”传根一边罱泥一边叫好。眼看船舱里就要装满了，这时传根放下罱网，拿起橹棒要摇船回去。“不装满就走啦？”荣荣喊住了传根。“没有地方装啦！”传根指着满满的一舱泥说。这时荣荣将带来的草帘插在河泥上，像囤粮食的折子一样，对传根说：“这不是地方吗？”传根打心里佩服荣荣的巧主意，这样，一船抵上两船用，可以少跑一趟两里多路的来回。这一天，他们一共罱河泥七舱，突破红旗劳动定额，荣荣得了二十八个工分。
    沈荣荣就是用这种实干加巧干的办法，提高了劳动工效。据小队计工员结算，从今年年初到5月10日，荣荣共做了三百五十八个劳动日，平均每天做二点七个劳动日。
