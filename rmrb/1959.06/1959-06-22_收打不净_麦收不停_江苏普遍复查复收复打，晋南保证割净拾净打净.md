Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st - Jiangsu Province has done a fast and good job with this year's wheat harvest. The province's 14 million mu of barley and naked barley have been basically threshed. Over 19 million mu of wheat is being threshed and it is expected that the threshing work will be basically completed in three to five days.

During the wheat harvest, all regions made both sunny and rainy plans for rushing the harvest and threshing, and prepared the tools for harvesting, transporting, and threshing early on. Due to the good arrangement of labor, the harvesting of barley and naked barley began in mid-May and was basically completed by the end of the month. When harvesting wheat, all regions adopted the experience of "ten-tenths mature, nine-tenths harvest" for barley and naked barley, and started harvesting wheat when it was nine-tenths mature, reducing the loss of wheat grains. In order to prevent the wheat from heating up and rotting in the plum rain season, the Suzhou area, which has two crops of rice and wheat a year, changed the old habit of threshing wheat after transplanting rice seedlings, so that transplanting rice seedlings and threshing wheat could proceed simultaneously.

This year's harvesting and threshing work for the three wheats is not only fast but also of good quality. All regions have launched a mass movement of re-checking, re-gleaning, re-threshing, and re-winnowing. After the 6.2 million mu of three wheats in Xuzhou Prefecture began to be harvested, they seized the opportunity to organize about 500,000 semi-laborers and children to re-gather the fallen grain. According to statistics from nine communes, they re-gathered 1.13 million jin of wheat in five days. In the Liucheng, Maocun, Daquan and other seven communes in the suburbs of Xuzhou City, more than 31,500 people participated in the re-gathering every day. From June 1st to 10th, they re-gathered more than 116,000 mu, recovering 588,930 jin of grain, an average of more than five jin per mu.

Many production teams in various regions have established re-inspection and acceptance groups, going deep into the fields and threshing grounds to inspect and appraise them one by one. In Jiao Xie, Ding Xin and other communes in Hai'an County, anti-rain grain protection committees have been established at all levels, and the brigades, teams, and members have all made grain protection agreements.

Taiyuan, 21st - All people's communes in the Jinan area of Shanxi Province are taking effective measures to harvest and thresh carefully, ensuring that the wheat is cut cleanly, transported cleanly, gleaned cleanly, and threshed cleanly, without losing a single grain, achieving a bumper harvest. At present, most of the 8 million mu of wheat in the area has been harvested.

This year's wheat harvest in Jinan is like "snatching food from the dragon's mouth," with tight time and a heavy workload. In order to implement the measures of careful harvesting and threshing, all people's communes have adopted inspection and supervision methods to prevent loss and omission. The Zhuangzi Management District of the Yongji People's Commune organized an inspection team during the wheat harvest to go deep into the teams to inspect the wheat harvesting situation. The inspection team found that the progress of wheat harvesting in the teams was very fast, but there were still very rough phenomena. For example, in the wheat field harvested by the first work group of the first production team, four ears were lost within one square foot, and the general stubble height was three inches. The cadres of the management district immediately used the rest time in the fields to organize the members to calculate two accounts. One account was: if an average of four ears are lost per square foot, and each ear is calculated as eleven grains, one mu of wheat will lose twenty jin, and the entire management district of 6,684 mu of wheat will lose 133,680 jin. This grain can feed 2,591 people in the entire management district for one and a half months. The other account was: if the wheat stubble is cut one inch higher, each mu will lose 30 jin of wheat straw, and the entire management district will harvest more than 200,000 jin of straw less. This straw can feed 462 livestock in the entire management district for more than 20 days. After calculating the two accounts, the members unanimously discussed and formulated five measures for careful harvesting and threshing. First, vigorously publicize the importance of careful harvesting and threshing and rushing to harvest and thresh, so as to achieve clean cutting, clean pulling, clean gleaning, and low stubble cutting. Second, reasonably adjust work points. According to the actual situation, the work points for cutting one mu of dry land wheat are increased from five or six points to seven and a half points, and the work points for cutting one mu of paddy field wheat are increased from seven and a half points to nine and a half points. Third, organize gleaning teams. Each work group will draw two auxiliary laborers to generally glean the harvested wheat fields again. Fourth, carry out mutual supervision and appraisal competitions. The wheat cutting group, the transportation group, and the threshing group must supervise each other to achieve clean cutting and clean transportation, clean ground and clean threshing ground, and conduct appraisals at the end of the wheat harvest. Fifth, impart wheat cutting techniques. Each production team should hire wheat cutting experts to impart experience to everyone during rest time in the fields.

The gleaning teams in various parts of the area have been dispatched one after another, striving to return every grain of the bumper harvest wheat to the granary. In Wenxi County, 25,000 auxiliary laborers and children were organized, divided into groups and areas, and put into gleaning activities. They followed behind the wheat cutting teams, gleaning carefully mu by mu, ridge by ridge, and picked up the lost wheat. By the 11th, the county's gleaning team had gleaned 269,000 jin of wheat, an average of ten jin more per mu. All schools in the Jinan area have organized gleaning teams under the unified arrangement of the commune to help the management districts and production teams glean wheat. Before organizing gleaning, Yuxiang Primary School in Yuncheng County also conducted education on cherishing food for the children. So far, according to incomplete statistics from five counties including Yuncheng and Jishan, 5,300 children have gleaned 154,200 jin of wheat.

### 收打不净　麦收不停  江苏普遍复查复收复打，晋南保证割净拾净打净

    收打不净　麦收不停
    江苏普遍复查复收复打，晋南保证割净拾净打净
    新华社南京21日电　江苏省各地今年麦收作得又快又好。全省一千四百多万亩大麦和元麦已基本脱粒完毕。一千九百多万亩小麦正在脱粒，预计三、五日内，脱粒工作便可基本结束。
    各地在麦收中，对抢收脱粒工作作了晴雨两套计划，并及早准备了收、运、打的工具。由于劳动力安排得好，大麦和元麦5月中旬开始收割，月底就基本收完。在收割小麦时，各地接受了大麦元麦“十成熟、九成收”的经验，小麦九成熟时就动手收割，减少了麦粒掉落。为了防止麦子在梅雨季节发热霉烂，稻麦两熟的苏州专区改变了栽秧后才进行小麦脱粒的旧习惯，使栽秧和小麦脱粒同时并进。
    今年三麦的收割、脱粒工作不但进度快、而且质量好。各地开展了复查、复拾、复打、复扬的群众性运动。徐州专区六百二十多万亩三麦抢收登场后，抓紧时机组织半劳力和儿童约五十万人进行复收。据九个公社统计五天内即复收麦子一百一十三万斤。徐州市郊区柳泉、茅村、大泉等七个公社每天有三万一千五百多人参加复收，从6月1日到10日，复收十一万六千多亩，收回粮食五十八万八千九百三十斤，平均每亩五斤多。
    各地很多生产队成立了复查验收组，深入田头和场头，逐块验收鉴定。海安县角斜、丁新等公社还层层建立了防雨保粮委员会，大队、小队和社员都订有保粮公约。
  本报太原21日电　山西省晋南区各人民公社采取有效措施，细收细打，保证小麦割净、运净、拾净、打净，颗粒不丢，丰产丰收。目前，全区八百多万亩小麦，大部已经收割完毕。
    今年晋南麦收的战斗有如“龙口夺食”，时间紧迫，工作量大。各人民公社为了贯彻细收细打的措施，采取了检查督促的办法，防止丢失和遗漏。永济人民公社庄子管理区在麦收中组织了一支检查队，深入各队检查收麦情况。检查队发现各队收麦的进度都很快，但是还有很粗糙的现象。例如第一生产队第一作业组割过的麦地里，一方尺内就丢掉四穗，一般茬高三寸。管理区的干部立即利用地头休息的时间，组织社员们算了两笔账。一笔账是：每方尺内平均按丢失四个穗，每穗按十一粒算，一亩麦就要损失二十斤，全管理区六千六百八十四亩小麦，就要损失十三万三千六百八十斤。这些粮食可供全管理区二千五百九十一人吃一个半月。另一笔账是：麦茬割的按高出一寸计算，每亩就要损失麦草三十斤，全管理区就要少收二十多万斤秸草。这些秸草可供全管理区四百六十二头牲口吃二十多天。算了两笔账，社员们一致商量订出了精收细打的五项措施。一、大力宣传细收细打和抢收抢打的重要性，做到割净、拉净、拾净、茬子割低。二、合理调整工分。根据实际情况，割一亩旱地麦由五分、六分工提高到七分五厘，割一亩水地麦由七分五厘工提高到九分五厘。三、组织搂麦队。每个作业组抽出两个辅助劳力，把收过的麦地再普搂一次。四、开展互相监督和评比竞赛。割麦组、运输组、打场组都要互相监督，作到割净运净，地净场净，麦收结束，进行评比。五、传授割麦技术。每个生产队要聘请割麦能手，利用地头休息时间，给大家传授经验。
    全区各地的拾麦队纷纷出动，争取丰收小麦颗粒归仓。闻喜县把辅助劳力和儿童二万五千人组织起来，分组分片，投入拾麦活动。他们跟在割麦队后面，亩亩细拾，垅垅不漏，把丢漏的小麦拾了回来。到11日全县的拾麦队伍已经拾麦二十六万九千斤，平均每亩地多收回十斤。晋南区各学校都在公社统一安排下，组织了拾麦队，帮助管理区、生产队拾麦。运城县虞乡小学在组织拾麦以前，还向孩子们进行了爱护粮食的教育。到目前为止，据运城、稷山等五个县的不完全统计，五千三百个儿童已拾麦十五万四千二百斤。
