Seeking Wisdom from Old Farmers

    Recently, after Ruichang County in Jiangxi Province arranged the work of eliminating the "three types of weak seedlings," Sun Fuhe, the first secretary of the county party committee, thought to himself, how much it would help to promote the movement if he could give the masses some specific methods of field management! So, on the very day the task was assigned, he went deep into the fields of the Dongshan Brigade of the Fanzhen Commune. Comrade Sun Fuhe invited several old farmers and asked them to talk about which method of weeding rice was better based on their experience. The old farmers, seeing that the county party secretary respected their opinions so much, all shared their views and experiences. They said that keeping a layer of water when weeding rice is right; weeding after draining the water is much easier, but the mud does not turn into slurry, the weeds will not die, and the weeding will not have much effect. After hearing this, Sun Fuhe realized that some of the "three types of weak seedlings" were inherently deficient, having been transplanted a few days late, while others were caused by acquired maladjustment. So, he further inquired about opinions on transforming the "three types of weak seedlings." The old farmer Zhan Jizhong said: There are methods, but I'm afraid some people won't believe them, and I'm also afraid that there won't be enough manpower to handle it all. Sun Fuhe quickly followed up and said: As long as the method is effective, I will definitely do it according to your opinions. Seeing that the county party secretary was so sincere, everyone offered suggestions one after another. The old farmer Fan Chuanyin finally suggested: Some people don't care about the quality of weeding, only focusing on speed, so there must be a responsibility system to guarantee it.
    Sun Fuhe summarized everyone's opinions into six points: (1) Apply ash (coal) before weeding, and dry the field until the soil cracks like sesame seeds, so that each application of ash is effective. (2) Weeding should be done close to the base of the rice plants. (3) Remove all the barnyard grass; the weaker the rice, the more the barnyard grass needs to be removed. (4) Rational irrigation and drainage: "Mangzhong" (Grain in Ear) should soak the roots, "Xia Zhi" (Summer Solstice) should soak the waist, and the feet should be dried when the ears emerge. (5) Fertilize according to the condition of the field and seedlings; after applying ash to the "three types of weak seedlings," add another fifteen loads of human manure. (6) Assign responsibility to individuals. Later, he also discussed with Wang Canxian, the secretary of the brigade party branch, and asked him: Can everyone do these things? Wang Canxian gave a definite answer.
    The method that Sun Fuhe sought from the old farmers was immediately studied by the county party committee and then promoted to all people's communes in the county.

    向老农取经
    最近，江西瑞昌县布置了消灭三类苗的工作后，县委第一书记孙福和心里想，如果能交给群众一些田间管理的具体办法，对促进运动的开展，该有多大帮助啊！于是，在布置任务的当天，他就深入到范镇公社东山大队的田间。孙福和同志请来了几位老农，请他们根据自己的体会谈谈那种耘禾的方法好。老农们看见县委书记这么尊重自己的意见，都谈出了自己的看法和经验。他们说，留一层水耘禾是对的，放干水耘，轻是轻得多，可是泥不成浆，草不会死，耘了作用也不大。听了这些，孙福和才意识到：三类苗有部分是先天不足，插迟了几天，而另一部分却是由于后天失调所致。于是，他进一步询问改造三类苗的意见。老农占吉忠说：办法倒是有，就怕有的人不相信，还怕人手不够，忙不过来。孙福和连忙接着说：只要办法有效，我一定照你们的意见办。大家看见县委书记这样诚恳，一个接一个地献计。老农范传银最后献计说：有些人耘禾不顾质量，光图快，要有个责任制才能保证。
    孙福和把大家意见归纳成六点：（一）先打灰（煤）后耘田，并且把田晒到芝麻裂，这样，打一次灰就见一次效。（二）耘草要耘靠禾脚。（三）稗子要扯净，禾越瘦，稗子越要扯。（四）合理排灌，“芒种”浸蔸，“夏至”浸腰，抽穗即晾脚。（五）看田看苗施肥，三类苗在打过灰后，再加十五担人粪。（六）责任到人。以后，他又找大队党支部书记王灿贤商量，并问他：这些意见大家能办到吗？王灿贤作了肯定的回答。
    孙福和在老农中求得的这个办法，县委马上进行了研究，随即就推广到了全县各人民公社。
