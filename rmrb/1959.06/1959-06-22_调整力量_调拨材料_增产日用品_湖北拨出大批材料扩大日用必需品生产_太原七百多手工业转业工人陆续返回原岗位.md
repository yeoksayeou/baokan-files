　　Adjusting Forces, Allocating Materials, Increasing Production of Daily Necessities
　　Hubei Allocates Large Quantities of Materials to Expand Production of Daily Necessities
　　More Than 700 Transferred Handicraft Workers in Taiyuan Return to Original Posts One After Another

　　(Report from this newspaper) The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has held successive meetings in recent days to discuss and arrange the current problems of the people's economic life.

　　The meeting made specific arrangements for the raw materials and varieties of daily necessities in Hubei Province. It was decided that starting from now, 5,000 tons of steel, 200 tons of copper, 50 tons of silicon steel sheets, 1 ton of magnesium, 10 tons of zinc, 6 tons of yarn-wrapped wire and enameled wire, 2,000 tons of cast iron, 20,000 cubic meters of wood, 1 million nan bamboo, and 16,000 pieces of cotton yarn will be allocated in batches to expand the production of daily commodities.

　　The Provincial Party Committee demanded that this batch of raw materials must be used for the needs of the people's lives, such as matches, soap, foot basins, water buckets, cool beds, cradles, kitchen knives, scissors, locks, mosquito nets, undershirts, hair nets, etc. The specific varieties should be planned by the commercial departments, and the light industry, chemical industry, and handicraft production departments should process and produce them on time, with guaranteed quality and quantity; each product must be implemented to ensure that a large number of products will meet consumers in a relatively short period of time.

　　In terms of non-staple foods, the Provincial Party Committee demanded that vegetable production be organized as quickly as possible to ensure sufficient vegetable supply in towns, cities, and industrial and mining areas in the near future; fish should be vigorously bred and caught, and professional fishermen in various regions should be organized to implement payment according to labor and pay a certain amount of public accumulation funds to the communes and production teams, with the state supplying fishing gear and uniformly distributing products; pig production should adopt a policy of both public and private raising, mobilizing institutions, organizations, factories, mines, schools, troops, and the masses to raise pigs, assigning pig raising tasks in rural areas to teams and households, solving the problems of private plots and feed, implementing the "two retentions" (retaining meat and retaining oil) policy, and implementing a reward system; in addition, poultry production such as chickens and ducks should be vigorously developed.

　　(Xinhua News Agency) Taiyuan City, which has a relatively weak light industry base, is taking various measures to increase the production of daily-use light industrial products.

　　Based on the spirit of long-term vision and attention to solving current practical problems, Taiyuan City has decided to first increase the production of cotton textiles, enamelware, ceramics, clothing, paper, soap, and small hardware. The increase in production of this batch of products will rely on existing light industrial production units to increase varieties and designs, and also rely on the return to work of some upgraded and transferred handicraft production cooperatives and the production of new products by newly built units last year. For example, Jin Sheng Textile Factory and Taiyuan Martyrs' Families Factory, in addition to producing the original bed sheets and clothing, have recently decided to add more than 100 varieties such as silk vests, silk socks, mask cloths, and medical gauze. More than 700 handicraft workers who were transferred last year are gradually returning to their original posts, restoring and enriching the industries producing daily necessities. Taiyuan Jinci Iron Smelting Plant and others not only enthusiastically mobilized the original handicraft workers to return to the team, but also helped them solve the difficulties of insufficient machinery. In addition, the newly built and expanded light industrial units in the Taiyuan area have now begun to produce daily necessities such as thermos bottles and light bulbs that Taiyuan City has never produced before.

　　Employees of the industrial and commercial departments of Taiyuan City have opened up a wide range of raw material sources for the production of daily-use light industrial products. Light industrial production units with better conditions, in addition to using a large number of small materials and side materials, have set up their own raw material production workshops or groups. For example, Taiyuan Leather Factory has established a leather regeneration workshop, and Taiyuan Woodware Factory reprocesses wood chips into wood panels. The commercial department recently mobilized 20,000 employees in the city to collect waste products door-to-door, which also increased a large number of raw materials for light industrial units. In the past ten days or so, they have collected 20,000 kilograms of discarded raw iron, steel, paper, glass, as well as silicon steel sheets, copper wires, and other materials.

    调整力量　调拨材料　增产日用品
    湖北拨出大批材料扩大日用必需品生产
    太原七百多手工业转业工人陆续返回原岗位
    本报讯　中共湖北省委近几天来连续召开会议，讨论并安排了当前人民经济生活的问题。
    会议对湖北省日用必需品的生产原料和品种作了具体的安排。决定从现在起，分期拨出钢材五千吨、铜二百吨、矽钢片五十吨、镁一吨、锌十吨、纱包线和漆包线共六吨、铸造生铁二千吨、木材二万立方公尺、楠竹一百万根、棉纱一万六千件，扩大日用百货的生产。
    省委要求，这批原料材料，必须用于为人民群众生活所需要的方面，如火柴、肥皂、脚盆、水桶、凉床、摇篮、菜刀、剪刀、锁、蚊帐、汗背心、发网等。具体的品种，由商业部门提出计划，轻工业、化学工业和手工业生产部门要按时、按质、按量加工生产；要件件产品落实，以保证在较短的时间内，有大批的产品与广大消费者见面。
    在副食品方面，省委要求以最快的速度，组织蔬菜生产，在不久的时间内，作到保证城镇和工矿区有足够的蔬菜供应；鱼类要大力进行繁殖与捕捞，把各地区的专业渔民组织起来，实行按劳取酬，并向公社生产队交纳一定数量的公积金，国家供应渔具，统一分配产品；生猪生产采取公养私养并举的方针，动员机关、团体、厂矿、学校、部队和群众喂养，农村生猪喂养任务派到队、户，解决好自留地和饲料，执行两留（留肉、留油）政策，实行奖励制度；此外要大力发展鸡鸭等家禽生产。
    据新华社讯　轻工业基础比较薄弱的太原市，正在采取各种措施增产日用轻工业品。
    本着从长远着眼，又重视解决当前实际问题的精神，太原市决定首先增产棉织品、搪瓷、陶瓷、服装、纸张、肥皂、小五金等产品。这批产品的增产，一方面要靠现有日用品轻工业生产单位增加花色品种，另一方面也要靠去年一些升级转业的手工业生产合作社归队复业和新建单位生产新的产品。如晋生纺织厂、太原烈军属工厂等，除了生产原来的床单、服装以外，最近又确定增加丝背心、丝袜子、口罩布、医药纱布等一百多种品种。去年转业的七百多名手工业工人，正在陆续重返原来的岗位，恢复和充实生产日用品的行业。太原晋祠炼铁厂等不仅热情地动员原来的手工业者归队，还帮助他们解决机具不足的困难。另外，太原地区新建和扩建的轻工业单位，现在已经开始生产出太原市从未生产过的暖水瓶、电灯泡等日用品。
    太原市工业和商业部门职工为日用轻工业品的生产开辟了广泛的原料来源。条件较好的轻工业生产单位，除了大批利用小料、边料以外，自己专门增设了原料生产车间或小组。如太原皮革厂建立了皮料再生车间，太原木器制造厂把木屑再加工成木板。商业部门最近动员全市两万名职工挨门串户收购废品，也给轻工业单位增加了大批原料。仅最近十多天来就收购了二万公斤废弃的生铁、钢材、纸张、玻璃，还有矽钢片、铜丝等器材。
