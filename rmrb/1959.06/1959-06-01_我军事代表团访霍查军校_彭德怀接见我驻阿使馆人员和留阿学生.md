Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 30th: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai, visited the Hoxha Military Academy today, accompanied by Albanian Minister of Defense, Baluku. The delegation received a warm welcome from the faculty and students of the entire school during the visit.

Marshal Peng Dehuai spoke at the welcoming meeting at the school. He said that the people's armies of China and Albania have grown up in long and arduous struggles, and have the fine traditions of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between superiors and subordinates, and unity between the army and the people. He encouraged them to build on these fine traditions, study hard, and become revolutionary cadres with high political consciousness and mastery of modern military science and technology.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that while all countries in our socialist camp are building with leaps and bounds, the U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are clamoring for war. Some of your neighboring countries are also following the plans of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, or are preparing to build missile launching pads. By doing so, they will only tie themselves more tightly to the war chariot of U.S. imperialism and move faster towards death.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that Albania is a member of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and any aggression against Albania by the enemy will only be met with a bloody nose in the face of the world's powerful fortress of peace.

Today, a portion of the delegation led by Marshal Peng Dehuai visited the Stalin Textile United Factory. Another portion of the delegation, led by General Zhang Zongxun, visited a mechanized regiment and watched a shooting competition between the mechanized regiment and the Hoxha Military Academy. On the 29th, our Military Friendship Delegation visited the local army and navy in Vlora, receiving a warm welcome from the officers and soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 30th: Vice Premier Peng Dehuai received all the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Albania and the Chinese students studying in Albania this afternoon. Vice Premier Peng Dehuai spoke with them.

    我军事代表团访霍查军校
    彭德怀接见我驻阿使馆人员和留阿学生
    新华社地拉那30日电　以彭德怀元帅为首的中国军事友好代表团，今天在阿尔巴尼亚国防部长巴卢库的陪同下，参观了霍查军官学校。代表团在访问过程中，受到了全校师生的热烈欢迎。
    彭德怀元帅在这个学校的欢迎会上讲了话。他说，中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国的人民军队都是在长期艰苦斗争中成长的，有着官兵一致、上下一致、军民一致的优良传统。他勉励他们在积极发扬这些优良传统的基础上，努力学习，成为具有高度政治觉悟和掌握现代化军事科学技术的革命干部。
    彭德怀元帅说，在我们社会主义阵营各国都以跃进的步伐进行建设的时候，美帝国主义及其仆从们却在叫嚣战争。你们的某些邻国也在奉行北大西洋侵略集团的计划，或者准备建立导弹发射台。他们这样作只有使他们自己更紧紧地缚在美帝国主义的战车上，更快地趋于死亡。
    彭德怀元帅说，阿尔巴尼亚是以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营中的一员，敌人对阿尔巴尼亚的任何侵略，在世界强大的和平堡垒面前，都只会碰得头破血流。
    今天，由彭德怀元帅率领的一部分团员，访问了斯大林纺织联合工厂。由张宗逊上将率领的另一部分团员访问了机械化团，并观看了机械化团和霍查军官学校的射击比赛。29日，我国军事友好代表团去发罗拉城访问了当地陆军和海军，受到官兵们的热烈欢迎。
