    The commune trade markets in Guangdong are undoubtedly a good way to promote diversified management of communes, develop commodity production, and strengthen economic ties between urban and rural areas.

    Many places have held materials exchange meetings at each level, with great results. Guangdong's approach is to fix a part of the materials exchange in the form of markets at the commune level, and hold them regularly under the leadership of state-owned commerce, thereby developing the advantages of the original rural fairs, so that communes and even the state can more planned and frequent organization of the economic life of the masses.

    Developing the diversified management and commodity production of communes is a long-term and important task. A part of the commodities produced by the communes are incorporated into the national plan through production and sales contracts, and another part is the third category of materials produced in large quantities and all year round outside the scope of the contract system. In order to make these materials flow smoothly, there is a need for regular grassroots exchange places to match them. The commune trade market in Guangdong is a necessary product of this objective situation.

    需要这种公社市场
    广东的公社贸易市场，无疑是促进公社多种经营、发展商品生产和加强城乡经济联系的一种很好的形式。
    许多地方逐级举行了物资交流会，成绩很大；广东的做法是在公社一级把一部分物资交流用市场形式固定下来，在国营商业领导下定期举行，从而发展了原有农村集市的优点，使得公社以至国家能够更有计划地经常地组织群众经济生活。
    发展公社的多种经营和商品生产是一项长期的重要任务。公社生产的商品，一部分经过产销合同纳入了国家计划，还有一部分是合同制范围以外的数量很大、常年生产的第三类物资。为了使这类物资货畅其流，就需要有与之相适应的定期的基层交换场所。广东的公社贸易市场，正是这种客观形势的必然产物。
