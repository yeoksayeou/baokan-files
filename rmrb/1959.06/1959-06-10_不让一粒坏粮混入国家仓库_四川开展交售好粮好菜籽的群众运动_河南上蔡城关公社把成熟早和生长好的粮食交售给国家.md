    Not Allowing a Single Grain of Bad Food to Enter National Warehouses
    Sichuan Launches a Mass Movement to Sell Good Grain and Good Rapeseed
    Shangcai Chengguan Commune in Henan Sells Early-Maturing and Well-Grown Grain to the State
    Chengdu, June 9th (Our Newspaper) – Sichuan Province is launching a movement in the summer grain and oilseed procurement to ensure that bad grain, insect-infested grain, and moldy rapeseed do not leave the production team, and that good grain and good rapeseed are sold to the state, emphasizing both quality and quantity. The province has already procured over 144.4 million catties of summer grain and over 200 million catties of rapeseed, all of which meet the national quality requirements for storage.
    This year, Sichuan emphasized quality from the start of the procurement work and conducted propaganda and education among the masses to ensure that good grain and good rapeseed are stored. Neijiang, Leshan, and other places also put forward the slogan "Not a single grain of moldy grain should enter the warehouse." In Meishan County, the grain and rapeseed sold by the people's communes must be inspected by the production team and only allowed to be sold to the state warehouse if they meet the quality standards.
    During the sale of large quantities of grain and oil, the grain and commercial departments have taken various measures to ensure quality. Throughout the province, cadres from the commune and team levels or experienced old farmers are generally absorbed to form grading groups, rationally assess the grade of grain and oil, display samples, determine grades according to samples, and implement premium prices for high quality to encourage farmers to improve quality. After participating in the grading group of the grain department, the SanShui Commune in Guanghan sold more than 10,000 catties of rapeseed in the first batch, all of which reached upper and middle standards. The grain department of Ebian County adopted the method of going to the commune to inspect and grade the quality, so that the grain that meets the standards can be transported in time, and the grain that does not meet the standards can be turned over and dried in time. This practice has been welcomed by the masses.
    Strict warehousing systems have also been established in various places to prevent grain and oil with high impurity and moisture content from mixing in and causing mold.
  At present, various places are continuing to promote the sale of good grain to the state and specifically assist the communes in preparing for storage. Most counties in the Neijiang area have convened meetings or on-site meetings of representatives from state and commune grain storage to study advanced experience in grain storage and pest control, and trained 4,687 grain storage and prevention personnel, providing technical support for the commune to store and sell good grain.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 9th – Chengguan People’s Commune in Shangcai County, Henan Province, has had a bumper wheat harvest this year. While harvesting and threshing, the commune launched a surge of delivering public grain and selling surplus grain. From June 1st to 3rd, it delivered and sold a total of 270,530 catties of grain, over fulfilling the task. After inspection, 85% of the delivered grain was of the highest grade, and the rest was of medium grade.
    This year, in order to change the old habit of delivering and selling grain only after harvesting and threshing, the Chengguan Commune Party Committee publicized the summer grain procurement policy to the commune members, calling on them to promote the spirit of "the state first, then the commune" and enthusiastically deliver and sell grain in advance. After discussions, the commune members ensured that the first grain threshed would be sold to the state. After threshing more than 220,000 catties of wheat that matured earlier and grew better on the hill, they dispatched more than 700 people to transport it all to the national granary.

    不让一粒坏粮混入国家仓库
    四川开展交售好粮好菜籽的群众运动
    河南上蔡城关公社把成熟早和生长好的粮食交售给国家
    本报成都9日电　四川省在夏粮、油料收购中展开坏粮虫粮霉湿菜籽不出队，好粮好菜籽交售给国家的运动，作到质量和数量并重。全省已收购的一亿四千四百多万斤夏粮、二亿多斤菜籽，都符合国家入库质量要求。
    今年四川各地在收购工作一开始，就强调质量，并在群众中开展把好粮、好菜籽入库的宣传教育。内江、乐山等地还提出“不让一颗霉烂粮食混入仓库”的口号。眉山县各人民公社出售的粮食、菜籽，都要经过生产小队的检查，合乎质量标准，才准挑往国家仓库出售。
    在大批粮食、油料出售中，粮食、商业部门采取了多种措施，保证质量。全省普遍吸收公社区、队干部或有经验的老农，组织评级小组，合理评定粮食、油料等级，陈列样品，按样品定级，实行优质优价，以鼓励农民提高质量。广汉三水公社在参加粮食部门的评级小组后，首批出售的一万多斤菜籽，全部达到上、中等标准。峨边县粮食部门采取了下社验质评级的办法，使符合标准的粮食及时运送，不符合标准的及时翻晒，干了就运，受到群众欢迎。
    各地并制定了严格的入库制度，防止杂质和水分较高的粮食、油料混入，发生霉变。
  目前，各地还在继续宣传把好粮卖给国家，并具体协助公社作好入库准备工作。内江专区大部分县都召开了国家、公社粮食保管代表会或现场会，学习先进的粮食保管、防治病虫害经验，培训了储粮防治人员四千六百八十七人，为公社保管和出售好粮提供了技术力量。
    据新华社郑州9日电　河南省上蔡县城关人民公社今年小麦大丰收。全社在边收边打的同时，掀起交公粮售余粮的热潮，从6月1日到3日共交售粮食二十七万零五百三十斤，超额完成任务。交售的粮食，经过检验，上等粮占85％，其余的都是中等粮。
    城关公社党委，今年为了改变过去收打完毕再交售粮食的老习惯，向社员宣传了夏粮征购政策，号召发扬先国家后公社的精神，踊跃提前交售粮食。社员们经过座谈讨论，保证把最先打下来的粮食卖给国家。他们把岗地上成熟较早、生长较好的二十二万多斤小麦打下来后，就出动七百余人，浩浩荡荡全部送入国库。（附图片）
