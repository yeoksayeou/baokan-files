To Provide the Country with Abundant Non-staple Foods
State Farms Greatly Develop Poultry and Livestock

According to the Liaoning Daily, after conscientiously implementing the management policy of vigorously developing non-staple food production, the 104 state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in Liaoning Province have seen a significant increase in pigs, chickens, ducks, and rabbits. Up to now, according to incomplete statistics, the number of pigs has increased to 135,000, a 50% increase compared to the beginning of the year; chickens, ducks, and rabbits have reached 350,000, a two and a half-fold increase compared to the beginning of the year. Currently, farm workers are vigorously building pig and chicken houses, preparing to develop more poultry and livestock.

In the past, state farms in Liaoning Province mainly focused on grain production, raising only a small number of fine breeding pigs to promote piglets to rural areas. As a result, the farm's pig population could not be developed for a long time, and the manure needed for grain production could not be fully supplied, so the grain yield increased very slowly. In February of this year, after the state farms changed their management policy based on the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the situation greatly improved. Many farms have grown from several hundred pigs to several thousand. Chickens and ducks have grown from none to tens of thousands.

In order to ensure the completion of meat production tasks, each farm has rationally arranged the production of feed crops, planted a large number of green fodder, and planted sweet potatoes and alfalfa, which can basically be self-sufficient in feed starting in July.

In addition to raising a large number of pigs and chickens, other animal husbandry is also developing rapidly. The milk production of dairy cows in the Tieling Livestock Farm has overcome the "May slack season" of previous years, and the whole farm's breeding mares have basically achieved full mating. The "Northeast Improved Sheep" raised by the Xiaodong Livestock Farm has greatly exceeded the plan for spring shearing, with an average wool production of 6.6 kilograms per sheep, and a high yield of 41 jin. The Tieling Breeding Farm also concentrated the farm's cows and mares for feeding, and established an artificial insemination station, planning to improve them with fine breeding stallions and bulls.

Xinhua News Agency: The hundreds of thousands of laborers in the Mishan and Hejiang Land Reclamation Bureaus in Heilongjiang Province, after years of unremitting hard work, have changed the face of the wilderness in the Mishan and Hejiang reclamation areas, and built a large state-owned agricultural (pastoral) farm group, which has begun to provide the country with abundant agricultural and livestock products, and will gradually become an important base for the production of marketable agricultural and livestock products.

The Mishan and Hejiang reclamation areas start from the Heilongjiang River in the north, to Xingkai Lake in the south, from the Xiaoxing'an Mountains in the west, to the Ussuri River in the east, forming a triangular area. Twenty-seven interconnected state-owned farms have now been established here.

These two reclamation areas have produced a large amount of grain for the country in recent years. Last year alone, they harvested more than 184,850 tons of grain, as well as other livestock products. This year, state farms are sowing 3.87 million mu of soybeans on 7.7 million mu of land, planning to produce 1.18 billion jin of soybeans for the country; in terms of animal husbandry, they plan to raise 325,690 pigs and 4.64 million chickens and ducks, and provide the country with 3,800 tons of pork, 5,100 tons of poultry meat, 3,000 tons of fresh eggs, and a large number of other livestock products by the end of the year.

In terms of management policy, all farms focus on agriculture (pastoral farms focus on animal husbandry), combining agriculture, animal husbandry, and industry to develop diversified production. Therefore, animal husbandry production has been greatly developed in recent years. For example, in January this year, the Mishan reclamation area raised 34,000 pigs and 160,000 chickens; after five months, the number of pigs more than doubled, and the number of chickens increased by more than two times. These two reclamation areas now have 148,000 pigs, 800,000 chickens, and a large number of cattle, horses, sheep, ducks, bees, silkworms, rabbits, etc. At the same time, industrial production serving agricultural production and life has also developed accordingly. The Hejiang Land Reclamation Bureau has built 141 large and small factories and non-staple food processing plants. The total industrial output value of the Mishan reclamation area will reach 20 million yuan this year. The establishment of industries by the farms not only solves the difficulty of processing agricultural and sideline products, meets the production and livelihood needs of the reclamation area, but also supports national construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Thirteen state-owned mechanical farms and eighteen local state-owned farms in Jiangsu Province are actively developing livestock and poultry production. The number of pigs in the pens of each farm has increased from 43,000 at the beginning of the year to more than 54,000, and the total number of poultry raised has reached 630,000, an increase of thirty times compared to the beginning of the year.

In the development of pig and poultry production, state-owned farms have established professional teams. Half of these breeders have undergone short-term professional training and can initially master the general knowledge and techniques of hatching and raising chicks. The farms have also mobilized everyone to raise poultry and livestock. The Dongxin and Yuntai farms have mobilized the entire farm to form a wave of enthusiasm for raising poultry, in which everyone cares and everyone participates.

The farms have tapped their potential and used local materials to build many simple poultry and livestock sheds. The Huaihai, Xinhe, Dongxin, Yuntai, and Lianhu farms have newly built 750 simple sheds. In terms of feed, the farms have expanded the planting area of feed crops and timely sown high-yield feed crops such as grains, roots, and tubers. Some farms have adopted methods such as replanting, mixed planting, intercropping, and intercropping, and using gaps to increase the planting area of feed crops. The farms also organized special forces to collect and store wild feed plants in large quantities, or collect shellfish, small fish, and small shrimps to feed chickens and ducks. Some farms used artificial insect breeding methods to breed earthworms, insects, etc. as feed. Farms with better land conditions and broad water areas have also formulated reasonable grazing plans to solve the feed problem in many ways.

    为国家提供丰富的副食品
    国营农场家禽家畜大发展
    据辽宁日报消息　辽宁省一百零四个国营农牧场在认真贯彻执行大量发展副食品生产的经营方针以后，猪、鸡、鸭、兔有了显著增加。到现在为止，据不完全统计，猪增加到十三万五千头，比年初增加50％；鸡、鸭、兔已达三十五万只，比年初增加两倍半。现在，农场职工正在大力修建猪、鸡舍，准备更多发展家禽家畜。
    辽宁省各个国营农场过去都以经营粮食为主，只养一小部分优良种猪，负责向农村推广仔猪。因此，农场猪群长期得不到发展，生产粮食的粪肥也得不到充分供应，粮食产量提高得很慢。今年2月，国营农场根据省委指示，改变了经营方针以后，情况大有好转。不少农场已由原来的几百头猪发展到几千头。鸡、鸭由一只没有，发展到几万只。
    为了保证完成肉食生产任务，各场合理安排了饲料作物生产，种植了大量青饲料，栽植了地瓜、苜蓿，7月份就基本上可以开始作到饲料自给。
    除了大量养猪养鸡以外，其他的畜牧业也都在迅速发展。铁岭畜牧场的奶牛产奶量已克服了历年“5月淡季”关，全场种母马基本做到全配全准。小东畜牧场养的“东北改良羊”，春季剪毛已大大超过计划，平均每只产毛六点六公斤，其中高产达四十一斤。铁岭种畜场还把全场的母牛、母马集中饲养，设立了人工授精站，计划用优良种公马、牛改良。
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省密山、合江两个农垦局的数十万劳动大军，经过几年来不懈的勤奋劳动，改变了密山、合江垦区荒原的面貌，建起了大型国营农（牧）场群，已经开始为国家提供了丰富的农畜产品，并将逐步成为一个商品性农畜产品生产的重要基地。
    密山、合江垦区北起黑龙江，南至兴凯湖，西起小兴安岭，东到乌苏里江，是个三角地块。这里现在已经建立起来二十七个互相毗连的国营农场。
    这两个垦区几年来已为国家生产了大量的粮食，仅去年一年就收获了十八万四千八百五十多吨粮食，还有其它畜产品。今年各国营农场在七百七十万亩土地上播种三百八十七万亩大豆，计划为国家生产十一亿八千万斤大豆；在畜牧业方面，计划养猪三十二万五千六百九十头，养鸡鸭四百六十四万只，到年底为国家提供三千八百吨猪肉，五千一百吨禽肉，三千吨鲜蛋以及其它大量畜产品。
    各农场在经营方针上，都以农业为主（牧场以畜牧为主），农业、畜牧业、工业相结合，发展多种生产，因此几年来畜牧业生产得到了很大发展。例如密山垦区今年1月份养猪三万四千头，养鸡十六万只；经过五个月，猪就增加了一倍多，鸡增加了两倍以上。这两个垦区现有十四万八千头猪，八十万只鸡，以及大量的牛、马、羊、鸭、蜜蜂、蚕、兔等。同时，为农业生产服务和生活服务的工业生产，也有了相应的发展。合江农垦局已经兴建大小工厂和副食品加工厂一百四十一项。密山垦区今年的工业总产值将达到二千万元。各农场兴办工业，不仅解决了农副产品加工的困难，满足了垦区生产和职工生活需要，同时也支援国家建设。
    据新华社南京讯　江苏省十三个国营机械农场和十八个地方国营农场积极发展家畜家禽生产。各场圈存的生猪已从年初的四万三千头增加到五万四千多头，家禽饲养总数已达六十三万只，比年初增加了三十倍。
    各国营农场在发展生猪和家禽生产中，都建立专业队伍。这些饲养员半数都经过短期专业训练，能初步掌握孵化育雏的一般知识和技术。各场还发动人人动手饲养家禽家畜。东辛、云台两场动员全场已经形成了人人关心个个动手的养禽热潮。
    各场都挖掘潜力，就地取材，盖了不少简易的禽畜棚舍。淮海、新河、东辛、云台、练湖等农场就新建了简易棚舍七百五十间。在饲料方面，各场都扩大了饲料作物种植面积，及时播种了谷类、块根、块茎等高产饲料作物。有的农场采取补种、混种、间作、套作和利用隙地种植等方法增加饲料作物种植面积。各农场并组织专门力量，大量收集和贮存野生饲料植物，或者收集蚌、小鱼、小虾等喂鸡喂鸭。有的场用人工培虫的方法，繁殖蚯蚓、昆虫等作饲料。土地条件较好和水面广阔的农场，还制定合理放牧规划，多方面地解决饲料问题。
