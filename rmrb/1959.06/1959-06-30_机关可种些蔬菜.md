    Government Offices Can Grow Some Vegetables
    In the past, our office always bought vegetables from the market. This spring, comrades used their spare time to reclaim more than one mu of land outside the city wall and planted more than ten kinds of vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, spinach, and small radishes. After careful management, they harvested more than 2,500 jin of vegetables, which were not only supplied to our office canteen but also sold a portion.
    I think that government offices with suitable conditions growing their own vegetable gardens can not only improve their living standards, but also strengthen the labor viewpoint of the cadres. Every time we finish a section of work in the vegetable garden, we feel very happy when we see the green vegetables growing in the garden.

    机关可种些蔬菜
    往年，我们机关吃青菜总是上街买。今年春天，同志们抽出业余时间，在城墙外开垦了一亩多地，种上了白菜、菠菜、小萝卜等十多种，经过精心管理，共收获了蔬菜两千五百多斤，除供应我们机关食堂以外，还出售了一部分。
    我觉得有条件的机关自己种菜园，不但能改善生活，而且也加强了干部的劳动观点。我们每次在菜园干完一段活后，看看园里长得青青的蔬菜，心情很愉快。山东费县人民银行　吕福礼
