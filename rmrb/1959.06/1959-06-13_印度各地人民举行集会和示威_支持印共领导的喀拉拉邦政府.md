　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 12th: People across India have begun holding “Kerala Week” since the 7th. They are expressing their support for the Kerala government through rallies and demonstrations, and opposing the movement launched by opposition parties in the state to overthrow the state government.

　　Delhi held a mass rally on the evening of the 11th for “Kerala Week.” Indian Communist Party leader Gupta condemned the opposition parties and anti-communist forces in Kerala for resisting the implementation of the education law by closing schools and for carrying out activities against the Communist-led state government. He said that these opposition parties are attempting to create a situation of lawlessness and chaos in the state so that the central government will intervene in order to overthrow the state government. He said that the Communist-led state government will not be intimidated by the threats of the opposition parties.

　　According to newspaper reports, "Kerala Week" has also been held in various parts of West Bengal. The Chief Minister of Kerala and leader of the Communist Party of India, Namboodiripad, presided over a rally of more than 200,000 citizens in Calcutta on the 6th. Speakers at a workers' rally in Dum Dum, near Calcutta, said that the Indian people, especially the working class, will never allow vested interest groups and the Catholic Church to overthrow the Kerala government.

　　Citizens of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, held rallies and demonstrations during "Kerala Week." Rallies in support of the Kerala government were also held in Punjab, Bombay, and Madras.

　　In order to avoid conflicts, the Kerala State Committee of the Communist Party of India has instructed its lower-level organizations not to hold rallies or demonstrations on the 12th (the day when the opposition parties hold their so-called "Liberation Day" activities). The State Committee has also reiterated its request to the opposition parties to hold negotiations in order to find peaceful solutions to all disputed issues.
