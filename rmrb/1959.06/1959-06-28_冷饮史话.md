A Brief History of Cold Drinks
Yang Min

Speaking of summer cold drinks, our country has a long history, as recorded in many ancient books and literary works.

The "Zhou Li" and "Tian Guan" contain records of so-called "Six Clear" beverages, which, in addition to ordinary water and various wines, include vinegar water, plum syrup, and "Yi" made from porridge. The Zhou Dynasty had a kind of bronze Jian, which was used as both a water tank and a refrigerator to ice various drinks and foods. It can be seen that as early as about three thousand years ago, our country already had quite good cool drinks. The "Chu Ci" and "Summoning the Soul" write: "Crushed grain frozen drink, offer coolness," meaning: "Iced glutinous rice wine, tastes fragrant and cool."

"Summoning the Soul" also mentions "Zhejiang" and "Yaojiang." "Zhejiang" is juice pressed from sugarcane, and "Yaojiang" is made from various fresh fruit juices, which can be said to be the earliest fruit dew. Du Fu of the Tang Dynasty wrote in a poem: "Green high locust leaves, picked and sent to the central kitchen... colder than snow after tasting, advising people to throw and compare pearls," describing the famous "Locust Leaf Cold Noodles." In the Song Dynasty, there was "Chrysanthemum Cold Noodles," which were made from rice, noodles, and other ingredients to make a thin porridge, then adding locust and chrysanthemum as spices, and cooling them with cool well water. As for sour plum soup, mung bean porridge, lotus seed soup, etc., which are still widely popular today, they also have a very long history.

The cold drinks produced in large quantities today have many types and names. In terms of composition, they can be summarized into two major categories: carbonated beverages and non-carbonated beverages. The representative of the former is soda, while the latter is more commonly represented by ice cream, popsicles, and fresh orange juice.

Ice cream is said to have originated in Italy. It was originally made by mixing niter and snow water and freezing it. Later, fruit juice and wine were added. This method was introduced to Paris, and the French changed to using milk and eggs as the main raw materials, supplemented by sugars, spices, and colorings. The British call it Ice Cream, the first word is "ice," and the second word is the main raw material in the finished product: "cream." When we translated this name, the first word used "meaning," but the second word was translated by "sound," which became "ice cream."

The main raw materials of ice cream are milk, eggs, etc., so the content of protein and fat is very high. Also, because sugar, fruit juice, pulp, etc. are used as auxiliary materials, carbohydrates, vitamins, and inorganic salts are also quite abundant. However, precisely because it contains more protein, fat, and sugars, it needs to be supplemented with more water to be digested and absorbed. Therefore, although it feels refreshing and cool when you first eat it, it often makes you feel thirsty afterward.

The invention of soda was relatively early. Around the 16th century, Europeans discovered that some spring water could cure diseases, and some spring water tasted cool and refreshing. Later, people realized that the cooling effect of spring water was due to the high amount of carbonic acid gas in the water. This kind of spring water was the early natural soda. At the end of the 17th century, people already knew how to use low temperature to dissolve a larger amount of carbonic acid gas in water, and later invented a method of dissolving gas under high pressure, so there gradually emerged artificial carbonated springs and other mineral spring industries. In 1820, a German pharmacist set up a factory to imitate "Niederselters" mineral water and accidentally discovered that in addition to being used for medicinal purposes, it could also be used for drinking. It was cool and refreshing, and no different from natural carbonated springs. This is the earliest artificial soda.

Carbonic acid gas is also called carbon dioxide. If water contains it, it will produce a slightly acidic and spicy sensation. In addition, the volatility of carbonic acid gas is very high. When you drink it, it will quickly take away heat and escape, making people feel refreshed and refreshed in the hot weather.

Ice cream and soda and other cold drinks were introduced to our country in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, the earliest factories in Shanghai were Lao Deji, followed by Watson's and Zheng Guanghe, etc., but unfortunately, they were all run by foreigners. It was not until 1926 that our own factories began to exist. It was only after liberation that there was large-scale development.

    冷饮史话
    杨旻
    说起夏季冷饮，我国有悠久的历史，这是许多古籍和文学作品里都记载了的。
    “周礼”“天官”上载有所谓“六清”的饮料，其中除普通的水和各种酒以外，还有醋水，梅浆和用粥调成的“酏”。周代有一种铜鉴，既用作水缸，同时也用作冰箱，冰镇各种饮料和食品。可见我国早在三千年左右以前，就已有相当不错的清凉饮料了。“楚辞”“招魂”上写道：“挫糟冻饮，酎清凉些”意思是说：“冰镇的糯米酒，喝起来又香又清凉”。
    “招魂”中还提到了“柘浆”和“瑶浆”，“柘浆”是用甘蔗榨成的液汁，“瑶浆”则是用各种鲜果汁加工而成，可以说是最早的果子露。唐朝杜甫诗云：“青青高槐叶，采掇付中厨……经齿冷于雪，劝人投比珠”描写的就是有名的“槐叶冷淘”。宋代则有“甘菊冷淘”，都是用米、面等先做成稀薄粥汤，再加入作为香料的槐、菊，用清凉井水降温而成。至于到现在还广泛流行的酸梅汤，绿豆粥、莲子羹等，历史也都很悠久。
    现在大量生产的冷饮，种类和名目很多，从成分上说，可以归纳为碳酸饮料和非碳酸饮料两大类。前一类的代表是汽水，后一类则以冰淇淋、冰棍、鲜桔水比较普遍。
    冰淇淋相传起源于意大利。最初是用硝石和雪水混合，予以冷冻而成。后来便进一步掺用果子汁，葡萄酒等物。这方法传到巴黎，法国人又改用牛乳、鸡蛋作为主要原料，佐以糖类，香料和色料等。英国叫它为lce Cream，前一字是“冰”，后一字是成品中的主要原料：“奶油”。我们把这名字翻译过来，前一字是用“义”，后一字却是译的“音”，这就成了“冰淇淋”。
    冰淇淋的主要原料是牛乳、鸡蛋等，所以蛋白质、脂肪的含量很高。又由于采用糖、果子汁、果肉等为辅助原料，所以碳水化合物、维生素和无机盐类也相当丰富。然而也正由于它含有较多的蛋白质、脂肪和糖类，就需要补充更多的水分，才能消化和吸收，所以刚吃的时候，虽觉沁齿清心，过后往往反而感到口渴。
    汽水的发明比较早。十六世纪前后，欧洲人发现有的泉水可以治病，有的泉水喝起来清凉爽快。后来人们才知道泉水的清凉作用，是由于水中含有多量碳酸气。这种泉水就是早期的天然汽水。十七世纪末，人们已经知道利用低温将较多量的碳酸气溶解于水中，后来又发明了利用高压溶解气体的方法，于是便逐渐有了人造碳酸泉和其他矿泉的工业。1820年，德国一药剂师设厂仿造“尼德瑟尔塔”矿水，意外地发现它除了可作为药用以外，又可用于喝饮，清凉爽快，和天然的碳酸泉无异。这就是最早的人造汽水。
    碳酸气又叫二氧化碳，水中若含有它，便会产生微酸和辣感。加以碳酸气的挥发性又很大，喝下肚去，它们更会迅速地带热而逃，使人炎暑顿消，神清心爽。
    冰淇淋和汽水等冷饮传入我国，是在清朝末期。当时在上海最早的制造厂是老德记，其次是屈臣氏和正广和等，可惜都是外国人所办。直到1926年，才开始有我国自己的制造厂。到解放以后，才有大规模的发展。
