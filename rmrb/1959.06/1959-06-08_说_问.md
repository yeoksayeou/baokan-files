    On "Asking"
    Feng Liping
    Thinking carefully about the word "学问" (xuéwèn, learning, knowledge), it's quite interesting. Putting "学" (xué, to learn) and "问" (wèn, to ask) together makes a lot of sense.
    Raising questions, recognizing and solving problems – this is one of the effective methods for academic research and practical work of all kinds, and should even be said to be indispensable. "Asking" is sometimes directed at others, and sometimes at oneself. Asking others often leads to enlightenment; asking oneself can stimulate thinking. Being able to ask and being good at asking are the results of being able to think and being good at thinking; asking well is proof of thinking well.
    As long as we pay a little attention, we can encounter "asking" (questioning, rhetorical questions, etc.) anytime, anywhere in our daily lives. The ancients advocated "not being ashamed to ask those below," and Confucius' disciples often asked him many clever questions. There is no shortage of people among the masses who "break the casserole and ask to the end," asking "how," "what," and "why" about everything, which is never a bad thing. Today, many intellectuals are able to put aside their airs and ask the workers and peasants for advice. This is a good trend, a new trend, a phenomenon that was never present or possible in any past era; this is the result of accepting the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao. Unfortunately, not everyone recognizes the significance of "asking," and even fewer people are willing to use this good method. For example, many universities have question-and-answer rooms, which are of great help to students' learning. But there is often this situation: during two self-study periods, not a single person asks a single question, the teacher sits on a cold bench, and the question-and-answer room exists in name only. Some people say, "I have no questions." This, of course, does not mean that they have understood everything, but often that they have not delved deeply and are not yet able to discover problems. Even more people are simply unwilling to ask, fearing that they will be laughed at for asking the wrong question. They consider "asking" to be "shameful," but do not say so. If this is the case in front of teachers, let alone "asking those below."
    "Asking" is not limited to seeking answers, as in mathematics, directly requesting a solution. People who are good at ideological work, when resolving ideological problems, sometimes do not explain many principles, but instead raise questions to inspire the other party to think. Often, a few question marks become the key to unlocking thought.
    History is also full of such thinkers. We can also look at the following interesting example: Hippias said: Beauty is a beautiful lady… Socrates said: Hippias, when a mare is beautiful, can we not acknowledge that it has beauty? (Plato's Dialogues on Art, p. 240) Regardless of whether Socrates' view of "what is beauty" is correct, he did not use lengthy rebuttals, but simply used simple rhetorical questions to refute his opponent, a method that cannot be said to be not clever and powerful.
    Let's recall Herzen and Chernyshevsky; they entitled their novels "Who is to Blame?" and "What is to be Done?", both with a large question mark at the end. This reminded the advanced figures of their time to explore the most important social problems and revolutionary tasks of the time – how powerful and inspiring this is!

### 说“问”

    说“问”
    冯力平
    仔细想一下“学问”这个词儿，颇有意思。把“学”和“问”放在一块儿，是很有道理的。
    提出问题，认识并解决问题，这是学术研究和作各项实际工作的有效方法之一，甚至应该说是必不可少的。“问”，有时是对别人，有时是对自己。问别人，常常能够得到教益；问自己，可以促使思考。能够和善于问，是能够和善于思考的结果；问得好，是想得好的证明。
    只要留一点儿神，在我们日常生活中，随时随地可以碰到“问”（提问、设问、反问等）。古人提倡“不耻下问”，孔子的弟子就常常向他提出许多聪明的问题来。群众中更不乏“打破沙锅问到底”的人，遇事就问个“怎么”“什么”“为什么”，是没有任何坏处的。今天，不少知识分子已能放下架子，提出问题去向工农群众请教。这是好风气、新风气，是过去任何时代所没有也不可能有的现象；这是接受了党和毛主席教导的结果。可惜，不是所有的人都认识了“问”的意义，更不是所有的人都愿意使用“问”这个好方法。例如，在高等学校里，多设有答疑室，这对同学们的学习有很大帮助。但也常有这种情形：在两节自习内，没有一个人提出一个问题来，教师坐冷板凳，答疑室形同虚设。有人说，我没有问题。这当然并不等于都弄懂了，却常会是没有深入钻研，还不能发现问题。更有许多人根本不愿意问，他们怕问错了，遭人笑话。他们以“问”为“耻”；但并不说出来。在老师面前尚且如此，更别说“下问”了。
    “问”，并不只限于求得解答，如数学上那样，直接要求一个得数。会做思想工作的人，他们解决思想问题，有时并不讲许多道理，而是提出问题来启发对方思考，往往几个问号成了打开思想的钥匙。
    历史上也不乏这样的思想家。我们还可以看看下面这个有趣的例
    子：希庇阿斯说：美就是一位漂亮小姐。……苏格拉底说：希庇阿斯，一匹母马是美的时候，能不承认它有美吗？（柏拉图文艺对话集240页）且不管苏格拉底对“美是什么”的看法是否正确，但他不用长篇的辩驳，只用简单的反问来驳倒了自己的论敌，这方法不能说不巧妙有力。
    我们试回想一下赫尔岑和车尔尼雪夫斯基，他们把自己的小说名曰“谁之罪？”“怎么办？”，后面都有一个大问号。这就提醒了他们那时代的先进人物去探讨当时最重大的社会问题和革命任务，这是多么有力而富有启发性啊！
