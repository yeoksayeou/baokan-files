Shanghai leather shoe stores recently used scrap leather to make more than 400 kinds of novel and unique leather shoes. Among them is a type of women's openwork shoe with a thin page sole, the front of the sole being a two-layer cloth sole, and the heel being a four-layer cloth sole; the outermost layer has two pieces of leather nailed to the front and back. These leather shoes are lightweight and soft, and the first batch sold out quickly after being put on the market.

Many new styles of children's shoes have clasps sewn from various shapes of scrap leather, some shaped like the moon, and some like peaches or melon seeds, which are most suitable for children aged two or three to wear.

    新颖别致的皮鞋
    上海皮鞋店最近用碎皮制成四百多种新颖别致的皮鞋。其中有一种薄页底的女式空花鞋，鞋底前部是二层布底，后跟是四层布底；最外一层前后钉两块皮。这种皮鞋轻便、柔软，第一批上市后很快就销售一空。
    许多新式的童鞋，搭攀是用各种形状的碎皮缝起来的，有的形状像月亮，有的像桃子、瓜子，最适合两三岁的孩子穿着。
