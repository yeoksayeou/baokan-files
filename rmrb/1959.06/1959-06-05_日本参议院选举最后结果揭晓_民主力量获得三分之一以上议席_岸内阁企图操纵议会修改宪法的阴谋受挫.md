Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 4th: According to the final results of the House of Councillors election announced by the Japanese Autonomous Ministry this morning, Japanese democratic forces have won more than one-third of the seats in this election, thus thwarting the Nobusuke Kishi government's plot to obtain the necessary two-thirds of the seats to revise the current constitution that prohibits Japan from waging war.

It was announced that thirty-eight candidates from the Japan Socialist Party and one candidate from the Japan Communist Party were elected. The elected candidate from the Japan Communist Party was Central Committee member Goro Suto.

The Japanese House of Councillors has a total of 250 members, with a term of six years, and half of the members are re-elected every three years. Among the half of the members who are not being re-elected this time, the Socialist Party has forty-seven members, and the Communist Party has two members. Therefore, these two parties opposing constitutional revision now occupy a total of eighty-eight seats in the House of Councillors, exceeding one-third of all seats. Through this election, the Japanese democratic forces have made significant progress. The Socialist Party gained seven seats more than before the re-election, and the Communist Party gained one seat.

In this fifth post-war Japanese House of Councillors election, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party attempted to seize more than two-thirds of the seats in order to revise the current constitution that prohibits Japan from waging war and possessing war forces. It also attempted to create more favorable conditions for approving the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that would drag Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system, so as to accelerate Japan's nuclear armament and further militarization.

In order to achieve this goal, in addition to using huge "election funds" provided by big capitalists for bribery, the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party also adopted various despicable means to defraud votes. Particularly vicious was Kishi Nobusuke's attempt to exploit the Japanese people's general desire to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, personally coming forward to make a gesture of "opening up the deadlock in Japan-China relations." His cabinet members and the Liberal Democratic Party also successively issued talks and statements, trying their best to conceal the sinister plot to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Kishi Nobusuke clique even instructed the notorious three right-wing elements, Higo Toru and others, to participate in the "election" in the Tokyo area under the guise of fabricated titles such as captain and deputy captain of the so-called "International Communist Organization Tokyo First 101 Special Agent Organ" in order to attack the prestige of the Japan Communist Party.

But as a result, the Liberal Democratic Party's attempt to seize two-thirds of the seats (167 seats) ultimately failed. Its newly elected members numbered seventy-one, an increase of five from before the re-election, plus sixty-one members who were not being re-elected, for a total of one hundred and thirty-two members.

The other conservative party, the Ryokufukai, suffered a crushing defeat in this election. It re-elected fifteen members this time, but only six candidates were elected, plus five members who were not being re-elected, now only eleven seats remained, nine seats less than before the re-election. The seats of independent candidates decreased by five from before the re-election, with a total of eighteen newly elected and non-re-elected. Small parties won one seat in this election.

    日本参议院选举最后结果揭晓
    民主力量获得三分之一以上议席
    岸内阁企图操纵议会修改宪法的阴谋受挫
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：据日本自治厅今天上午公布的参议院选举最后结果，日本民主力量在这次选举中获得了超过三分之一的议席，从而粉碎了岸信介政府企图取得三分之二的必要议席来修改禁止日本作战的现行宪法的阴谋。
    据宣布，日本社会党的三十八名候选人和日本共产党的一名候选人当选。日本共产党候选人当选的是中央委员须藤五郎。
    日本参议院共有二百五十名议员，任期六年，每三年轮流改选一半。这一次不改选的一半议员中，社会党有四十七名议员，共产党有二名议员。因此这两个反对修改宪法的政党在参议院中现在就共占有八十八席，超过了全部议席的三分之一。通过这次选举，日本民主力量获得了显著的进展。社会党比改选前增加了七席，共产党增加了一席。
    在这次日本战后第五次参议院选举中，执政的自由民主党企图攫取三分之二以上议席，来修改禁止日本作战和保有战争力量的现行宪法，并且企图为批准把日本拉入美国原子战略体系的新的日美“安全条约”创造更有利的条件，以便使日本加速核武装和进一步军国主义化。
    为了达到这个目的，岸信介政府和自由民主党除了拿大资本家供给的巨额“选举资金”进行贿选以外，还采取了各种卑鄙手段骗取选票。特别恶毒的是岸信介企图利用日本人民普遍要求恢复日中邦交的情绪，曾经亲自出面作出要“打开日中关系僵局”的姿态。他的阁员和自由民主党还接连发表谈话和声明，竭力掩饰修改日美“安全条约”的罪恶阴谋。岸信介集团甚至还指使臭名远扬的三名右翼分子肥后享等，打着捏造的什么“国际共产机构东京第一○一特务机关”队长和副队长的招牌，参加东京区的“竞选”，以图打击日本共产党的威信。
    但是结果，自由民主党企图攫取三分之二议席（一六七席）的阴谋终于没有得逞。它新当选的议员是七十一名，比改选前增加五名，加上不改选的议员六十一名，一共是一百三十二名。
    另一个保守政党绿风会在这次选举中遭到惨败。它这次改选十五名议员，可是只有六名候选人当选，加上不改选的五名议员，现在只剩下十一个议席，比改选前少了九席。无党派人士的议席比改选前减少五席，新当选和未改选的共为十八名。小党派在这次选举中取得一席。（附图片）
