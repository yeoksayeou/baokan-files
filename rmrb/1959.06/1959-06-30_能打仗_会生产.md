　　**Microshan Lake Ducks in Flocks**

　　The clear waters of Microshan Lake stretch to the sky, rippling gently. As you sail towards Yuniu Bay in a small boat, you can hear the quacking sounds from afar and see flocks of ducks floating on the lake. These are the six thousand ducks raised by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in their vigorous campaign for sideline production. In the past two months, these ducks have laid more than 94,000 eggs. Sometimes, they lay more than 4,000 eggs a day.

　　To save on duck feed, this unit "settled" the ducks on the lake. All year round, soldiers take turns driving the flocks on the lake, allowing the ducks to catch small shrimp, snails, and various aquatic foods. The soldiers who herd the ducks often have their clothes soaked during the rainy season. In winter, they even break the ice to allow the ducks to find food in the water. This saves 750 jin of duck feed every day.

　　The soldiers who herd the ducks take great care of them. One night in early May, a storm arose on the lake, and the duck flocks got scattered, crying out in the wind and waves. Soldiers like Zhao Hongqin braved the storm to chase them on the lake, and it wasn't until dawn that they had gathered all the scattered ducks back into the enclosure.

　　**Colonel Raises Pigs**

　　Colonel Liu Kekuan, political commissar of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison, volunteered to go to the pig farm when he went down to the company as a soldier, in order to strive for self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables for the unit. At the pig farm, he and the breeders fed 140 piglets together.

　　Every morning at six o'clock, he got up with everyone to drive the piglets out of the pigsty, clean the pigsty, and prepare feed for the pigs. While feeding the pigs, he carefully observed the changes in each pig. If one ate less, or its tail didn't wag as energetically, he knew which pig was sick and immediately told the veterinarian to treat it. To prevent the spread of pig diseases, Colonel Liu Kekuan and the breeders worked together to mix mud and carry bricks to build some new pigsties. When cleaning the old pens, he found usable bricks in the sludge and manure, so he picked them up, cleaned them, and used them on the new pigsties. During this month of being a soldier, Colonel Liu Kekuan also read many books on pig raising and combined them with practice to summarize some pig raising experiences, helping the pig farm establish a complete set of systems, which greatly improved the work of the pig farm.

　　**Vegetable Flowers Fragrant on the Snowy Plateau**

　　Wei Shengguan, a vegetable-growing expert on the snowy plateau, has emerged from a certain border defense unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Ritu Zong area of northern Tibet.

　　Ritu Zong is a high-altitude and cold region at an altitude of 4,000 meters. In the past, most of the vegetables eaten by the troops and Tibetan compatriots there were transported from the mainland after the snow on the Kunlun Mountains began to melt every summer. However, due to the long distance, not only were the transportation costs extremely high, but most of the transported vegetables rotted. In order to reduce the burden on the people of the motherland, the border defense troops actively organized many amateur vegetable-growing groups, determined to try to grow vegetables on the snowy plateau.

　　Squad leader Wei Shengguan, in the intervals between performing patrol and training missions, organized a vegetable-growing group with several soldiers. They carefully checked and studied everything, from planting a seed to sprouting a bud. After many experiments, they found that vegetable seeds do not need to be soaked in water when planted on the plateau, and potatoes can be watered two or three inches after the sprouts emerge from the soil, so they can grow quickly and well. After their painstaking cultivation, tender, green, fat radishes, cabbages, spinach, and turnips finally grew in a vegetable garden on the snowy plateau. They harvested more than 50,000 jin of vegetables in one season. Among them were large cabbages weighing twelve jin and turnips weighing five jin.

　　**Many Tricks for Sea Production**

　　Every Saturday or Sunday, sailors from a People's Navy unit in a certain military port sail out to sea to fish in fishing boats. Since the beginning of March, they have caught more than 2,000 jin of large yellow croaker and more than 20,000 jin of cuttlefish.

　　After receiving instructions from higher authorities on carrying out sideline production, this naval unit immediately established a fishing team based on their characteristics, and used holidays and rest time to raise fishing gear. Under the personal command of the unit leaders, the sailors often worked until midnight on holidays, returning to the port with the joy of a rich harvest.

　　In another bay not far from the military port, there are patches of kelp that look like green velvet carpets. These are 63 mu of kelp, a total of 2.5 million plants, that were planted in stages by a certain naval unit in February and March using spare time. Now, these kelp are growing very well, generally more than two meters long and about sixteen centimeters wide.

    能打仗  会生产
    微山湖上鸭成群
    微山湖碧水连天，清波荡漾。当你乘着小舟向淤泥湾划进的时候，很远就能听到嘎嘎的叫声，看到一群群鸭子漂浮在湖面上。这是人民解放军某部在大搞副业生产中饲养的六千只鸭子。这些鸭子在最近两个月中下了九万四千多个蛋，有时，一天能下四千多个蛋。
    这支部队为了节省养鸭的饲料，便使鸭子在湖上“安家”。一年四季，战士们轮换着在湖上赶着鸭群，让鸭子到处捉捕小虾、螺丝和水中各种食物。放鸭子的战士们，在梅雨季节衣服经常被淋透，冬季他们还把冰层凿开，让鸭子在水中找寻食物。这样，每天可以节约七百五十斤鸭粮。
    放鸭的战士们非常爱护鸭子。5月初的一个夜里，湖上起了暴风雨，鸭群失伙了，卷在风浪里惊叫。战士赵洪勤等冒着风雨在湖上追赶，直到天亮才把失散的鸭子全部赶到圈内。
    上校养猪
    北京地区部队某部政委刘克宽上校，为了争取部队肉菜自给，在下连当兵时，主动要求到了养猪场。在养猪场里，他和饲养员们一起喂了一百四十多头小猪。
    每天早晨六点钟，他就起床和大家把小猪从猪圈里赶出来，清扫猪圈，办置饲料喂猪。在喂猪时，他详细观察每头猪的变化，哪个吃食少，哪个的尾巴摇摆得没劲，知道哪个猪有病，他就马上告诉兽医给它治疗。为了防止猪的传染病，刘克宽上校和饲养员们一起合泥、搬砖，修了一些新猪圈。在清理旧圈时，他发现污泥和粪便里有可用的砖头，便随手拣出来弄干净，用在新建猪圈上面。在这一个月的当兵期间，刘克宽上校还读了许多有关养猪的书籍，并且结合实际总结出一些养猪经验，帮助养猪场建立了一套完整的制度，使养猪场工作有了很大的改进。
    风雪高原菜花香
    驻守在藏北日土宗地区的人民解放军某边防部队，出现了一位在风雪高原上种菜能手魏生官。
    日土宗是海拔四千公尺的高寒地区，过去那里的部队和藏胞吃的蔬菜，大多是当每年夏季昆仑山积雪开始溶化后，由内地人民运去的。但是，由于路途遥远，不但运费极高，而且运去的青菜大部分都烂了。为了减轻祖国人民的负担，边防部队积极组织了许多业余种菜小组，决心在风雪高原上试种出青菜来。
    副班长魏生官在执行巡逻、训练任务的间隙，和几个战士组织了一个种菜小组。他们对种下一粒籽，生出一颗芽，都细心地进行检查、研究。他们经过多次试验，发现在高原上种菜菜籽不要用水泡，马铃薯芽出土后二、三寸再浇水，就能长得既快又好。经过他们的苦心栽培，风雪高原上的一个菜园里，终于长出了嫩绿肥壮的萝卜、白菜、菠菜和蔓菁。他们一季就收获了蔬菜五万多斤。其中，有十二斤重的大白菜和五斤重的蔓菁。
    海上生产窍门多
    每当星期六或星期天，在某军港的一支人民海军部队的水兵们，便驾着渔舟扬帆出海捕鱼去了。从3月初到现在，他们已捕获了大黄鱼二千多斤，墨鱼两万多斤。
    这支海军部队在接到上级机关关于开展副业生产指示后，根据他们的特点，立即成立捕鱼队，利用假日和休息时间，筹齐了捕鱼工具。在部队首长亲自出海指挥下，水兵们常常在假日劳动到深夜十二点钟，带着丰收的喜悦返回港内。
    在离军港不远的另一个海湾里，漂着一片片像绿色绒毯似的海带。这是海军某部在2、3月份利用空隙时间分期种植的六十三亩共计二百五十万棵海带。现在，这些海带长得很好，一般的都有二公尺多长，十六公分左右宽。
