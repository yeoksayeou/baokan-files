    Stepping Out From Behind the Window
    Lin Yi
    The Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory canteen used to sell meal tickets in the office. Later, they changed their approach, with staff carrying canvas bags and selling them in the canteen during meal times. The masses unanimously praised this, listing it as a new and positive development in the canteen's work. The information desk at the factory's hospital used to be like those in other hospitals, set up behind a window. Later, they changed it to a nurse standing at the entrance, both attending to patients and answering questions. Despite the large number of people seeking medical attention, everything was in good order, giving people a pleasant feeling as soon as they entered.

    On June 3rd, the "Beijing Evening News" reported that the staff of the Dongdan Post Office delivery team, in order to promote the spirit of "giving convenience to customers and keeping difficulties for ourselves," changed the practice of sending remittances and packages by delivering them directly to the recipient's door. An old man said with emotion: "I've lived for over sixty years, and I've never seen anything as novel as a postman delivering remittances to the door." There are many things like this, all illustrating a problem: these comrades who do service work have changed an old tradition. They no longer wait for customers to come to them when they need something, but instead actively seek out customers, notice any difficulties they might have, and proactively help them solve them. In short, they have turned passive work into active work.

    Such things can be said to be simple and easy to implement, just a step from inside the door to outside the door. Unfortunately, some units that have a lot of contact with the masses have not yet taken this step.

    Setting up information desks inside windows is a long-standing practice. With questions and answers, no matter how many people there are, you have to deal with them one by one, which seems reasonable. Some work seems to be inherently passive. In fact, passive and active are relatively existing. Passive can become active, and active can also become passive. Every job has the issue of being active or passive. Making work passive not only fails to truly achieve the goal of serving the people, but also makes oneself lose interest and unable to muster that vigorous energy. Although the problem is only a step away, taking this step requires some determination and courage.

    从窗口里走出来
    林伊
    郑州纺织机械厂职工食堂卖的饭票，本来是在办公室里卖，后来改变办法，工作人员背个帆布包，开饭时就到食堂去卖。群众一致叫好，把它列为食堂工作的一项新气象。这个厂职工医院的问事处，本来跟别的医院一样，是设在窗口里面，后来改成门口站个护士，一面照顾病人，一面解答问题。尽管就诊的很多，但却井然有序，一进门就给人一个愉快的感觉。
    6月3日，“北京晚报”载，东单邮局投递组的职工，为了发扬“把方便送给顾客，把困难留给自己”的服务精神，把汇款、包裹改成直接送到收件人的家门口。有位老大爷感动地说：“我活了六十多岁，从没见过邮递员将汇款送到家里的新鲜事。”这一类的事情很多，都说明一个问题，这些做服务性工作的同志改变了一个老传统，他们不再是等顾客有事找上门，而是主动地去找顾客，看出你可能有什么困难，就主动地帮你解决。总之，他们把被动的工作变成了主动的工作。
    这种事可以说是简单易行的，只是从门里跨到门外。可惜是有些接触群众较多的单位，却还没有跨出这一步。
    问事处设在窗口里面，这是由来已久的。有问有答，人再多，也得一个一个来，也似乎是合情合理。有些工作，好像天生就是被动的。其实，被动和主动是相对地存在着的，被动能变成主动，主动也能变成被动。每一项工作都有主动与被动的问题。把工作搞被动了，不但达不到真正为人民服务的目的，而自己也将是兴味索然，鼓不起那种生气勃勃的劲头来。问题虽然只是一步之差，但要迈出这一步，却是需要几分决心和勇气的。
