    A Child Will Not Grow Up Without Nurturing; A Tree Will Not Become a Forest Without Nurturing
    Our Commentator
    Sowing tree seeds and planting saplings is only the beginning of afforestation work. To truly achieve afforestation, there is still much work to be done. Large areas of young forests have been planted again this past winter and spring, which is a great achievement; however, whether this achievement can truly become an achievement in afforestation depends on how well the tending work is done. If the tending is timely and meticulous, more saplings will survive and grow better; if the tending is poor, or if there is no tending, the saplings will not grow well, and even large areas of young forests may be submerged by weeds and die, making the afforestation work a complete waste. Tending saplings is the same as nurturing children; for a child to grow into an adult, and for a sapling to grow into a forest, long-term hard work is required.
    This year's sapling tending work is more arduous than in the past. Not only do the saplings planted this spring need tending, but the saplings planted in previous years also need tending. Since last year, many fast-growing and high-yielding forests have been created in various places, and the number of trees planted "around the four sides" has also greatly increased. These young forests and seedlings need more careful tending and management. The season for tending young forests is also the busy farming season. To ensure that agricultural production is not affected while doing a good job in young forest tending, two problems must be solved: one is the problem of ideological understanding; the other is the problem of work arrangement.
    Some people do not realize the necessity of tending young forests. They believe that mountains and forests are things that "grow naturally, on their own" and do not need tending; some people are afraid of investing too much labor with little or slow return, making it not worth the effort; and some people are afraid that engaging in young forest tending work will hinder agricultural and sideline production. To do a good job in young forest tending work, these ideological understanding problems must be solved first. It is necessary to carry out propaganda and education work among the broad masses, explaining the principle of "relying on the mountains to eat, but also nurturing the mountains," and using facts to illustrate the importance of young forest tending work. Planting trees is like planting crops; you cannot get a good harvest without effort. The soil conditions for planting trees are far worse than those for planting crops, so tending and management should not be neglected. Some places have "planted trees every year but never seen a forest," and the reason is neglect of tending. Mobilizing millions of people, painstakingly collecting seeds, cultivating seedlings, climbing mountains and ridges, sowing seeds and planting trees, if not many survive, it will greatly damage the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation. To improve the survival rate of trees, it is necessary to strengthen young forest tending work. Facts have proved that the growth of tended young forests is very different from that of untended young forests. In Xincheng Township, Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, the trees planted on a hillside, more than ten mu of which were weeded five times, grew to more than five feet tall in one year; while another five mu were not weeded carefully, and the saplings only grew more than one foot tall. Will strengthening young forest tending be not worth the effort? In fact, on the contrary, only by doing a good job in young forest tending can benefits be reaped earlier and more abundantly. If young forests are not tended, it will cause a waste of seedlings and labor, and even result in nothing. In Yikou Village, Qianlinyu County, Hebei Province, 550 mu of oak trees were directly sown in 1951, and the survival rate was 85% when checked in 1952; but later, tending and management were not carried out in a timely manner, weeds grew rampant in the forest, and the weeds submerged the saplings. When checked again in 1953, most of the saplings had withered. Does strengthening young forest tending hinder agricultural and sideline production? The facts in many places have long proved that good young forest tending can quickly conserve water and soil and prevent wind and fix sand, which has played a great role in increasing agricultural production; and with more mountains and forests, there are more ways to develop sideline occupations.
    Of course, from the current point of view, tending young forests and agricultural production are contradictory in terms of labor. However, this problem is not unsolvable. On this issue, many places have already gained some experience. The practice of combining short-term shock tactics with professional teams in afforestation is still applicable in young forest tending work. The Longshan People's Commune in Guzhang County, Hunan Province, proposed: "Go all out in mountain and forest work during the slack season, and do a little mountain and forest work during the busy season, grasping both the thousand-jin mu and the ten-thousand-treasure mountain." In mid-April, they organized twelve professional teams and adopted a combination of professional teams and large-scale battles to carry out oil-tea camellia forest reclamation and inter-tillage, and vigorously engaged in intercropping of forests and grains. Huaihua Township in Pengxi County, Sichuan Province, adopted the method of "engaging in agriculture on sunny days, tending on rainy days, seizing every opportunity, and working whenever there is time," achieving the goal of not neglecting both agriculture and forestry.
    Young forest tending work should be contracted by area. Each commune, production team, or industrial and mining enterprise, school, government agency, etc., should be responsible for the forest land under its charge. This spring, some units in Henan, Guangdong, and other places established a "afforestation file system," which is an effective measure to improve afforestation quality and strengthen the management of young forests. More than a dozen counties and cities in Henan Province have promoted this practice: erecting a sign in the forest land, writing on it the afforestation date, afforestation area (or number of trees), forest type, tree species, brief measures, person in charge, forest protection covenant, etc.; and at the same time establishing files, recording the results in the files after the end of each stage of work such as afforestation, young forest tending, and young forest inspection. This not only clarifies responsibilities and facilitates inspection and comparison, but also can accumulate data, master the growth patterns of trees, accelerate the pace of afforestation, and improve the quality of afforestation.
    Young forest tending work and agricultural production can be closely integrated. If integrated well, it can achieve the effect of double harvest of agriculture and forestry, both tending young forests and increasing agricultural production. Practicing intercropping of forests and farms, planting some crops in forest land, is the best way. According to an incomplete statistic in Shanxi Province in 1957, more than 55,000 mu of forest land were intercropped with farms, yielding nearly 2 million jin of grain, with an average yield of more than 35 jin per mu, and the survival rate of young forests was also relatively high. Tending young forests can also be combined with manure accumulation. The weeds hoed down when tending young forests can be used to compost a large amount of fertilizer. In 1958, Wengxi Township, Sinan County, Guizhou Province, tended 2,850 mu of young forests and accumulated more than 5.6 million jin of fertilizer. The masses realized the benefits of young forest tending, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly increased, hoeing weeds in the forest land despite strong winds and rainstorms.
    The most arduous work in tending young forests is weeding and loosening the soil. Mastering the methods and timing of weeding and loosening the soil can achieve greater results with less labor. Weeding should be done "early, small, and thoroughly," so that labor can be saved. It is best to gradually deepen the soil loosening, and in sandy areas or mountainous areas, it is also necessary to add soil at the same time. In order to save labor and improve labor efficiency, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to create and reform weeding and soil loosening tools.
    While tending young forests, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of young forests and prevent people and livestock from destroying them. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to formulate and earnestly abide by forest protection covenants, and to regularly educate the masses to cherish trees.

    儿不抚育不成人　树不抚育不成林

    把树籽播下，把幼苗栽上，仅仅是绿化工作的开始。要真正实现绿化，还有许多工作要做。去冬今春各地又种植了大片大片的幼林，成绩很大；但是，这成绩能不能真正成为绿化的成绩，还要看抚育工作做得如何。抚育得及时，抚育得细致，幼苗就能多成活一些，长得就好一些；抚育得不好，或者不抚育，幼苗就长不好，甚至会有大片幼林被杂草淹没而枯死，使造林工作前功尽弃。抚育幼苗同抚育幼儿是一样的；要孩子长大成人，要树苗长大成林，都需要长时期的辛勤的劳动。
    今年的幼苗抚育工作比过去更加繁重了，不仅今年春季栽植的幼苗需要抚育，前几年种植的幼苗也需要抚育。去年以来，各地营造了很多速生丰产林，“四旁”植树数量也大为增加，这些幼林和苗木更需要精心地抚育管理。抚育幼林的季节，又正是农忙时期，要做到既不影响农业生产，又做好幼林抚育工作，必须解决两个问题：一个是思想认识问题；另一个是工作安排问题。
    有些人没有认识到幼林抚育的必要。他们认为：山林是“靠天生，自己长”的东西，用不着抚育；也有些人怕投工多、收效小或收效慢，得不偿失；还有些人怕搞幼林抚育工作妨碍农业和副业生产。要搞好幼林抚育工作，先要解决这些思想认识问题。要向广大群众进行宣传教育工作，说明“靠山吃山要养山”的道理，用事实说明幼林抚育工作的重要性。种树和种庄稼一样，不下功夫是得不到好收成的。种树的土壤条件远不如种庄稼的好，抚育管理就更不可忽视。有些地方“年年造林不见林”，原因就在于忽视抚育。动员了千百万人，千辛万苦采了种，育了苗，爬山越岭，播种植树，如果成活的不多，就大大损伤群众造林积极性。要提高林木的成活率，就必须加强幼林抚育工作。事实证明：抚育过的幼林和没有抚育的幼林，生长情况大不相同。陕西省醴泉县新城乡在一个山坡上栽的树，有十多亩锄了五次草，幼树一年里长到五尺多高；而另外五亩没有注意锄草，树苗只长了一尺多高。加强幼林抚育，会不会得不偿失呢？其实，恰恰相反，只有做好幼林抚育工作，才能较早地较多地收到效益。如果不抚育幼林，就会造成苗和劳力的浪费，甚而一无所得。河北省前临榆县义口村1951年直播五百五十亩栎树，1952年检查时成活率为85％；但以后没有及时进行抚育管理，林内杂草丛生，杂草淹没了树苗，到1953年再检查，幼树绝大部分都枯死了。加强幼林抚育，是不是妨碍农业、副业生产呢？不少地方的事实早已证明：幼林抚育得好，很快就能保持水土、防风固沙，对农业增产起了很大作用；山林多了，发展副业的门路也就多了。
    当然，从眼前看来，抚育幼林同农业生产在劳动力上是有矛盾的。可是，这个问题并不是不能解决的。在这个问题上，不少地方已经摸到了一些经验。造林的时候所采用的短期突击和专业队相结合的作法，在幼林抚育工作中还是适用的。湖南省古丈县龙山人民公社提出：“小忙大搞山林，大忙小搞山林，既抓千斤亩，又抓万宝山。”他们4月中旬组织了十二个专业队，采用专业队和大兵团作战相结合的形式，开展油茶林垦复和中耕，并大搞林粮间作。四川蓬溪县槐花乡，采取“晴天搞农业，雨天搞抚育，见缝插针，有空就干”的办法，做到了农林两不误。
    幼林抚育工作应当分片包干。每个公社、生产队或工矿、学校、机关等单位，对所负责的林地都要负责到底。今春河南、广东等地有些单位建立了“造林档案制”，这是提高造林质量和加强幼林的经营管理的有效措施。河南十多个县、市推行了这样的作法：在林地树立一块牌子，上写造林日期、造林面积（或株数）、林种、树种、简要措施、负责人、护林公约等；同时建立档案，在造林、幼林抚育、幼林检查等每段工作结束以后，就把结果记入档案。这样做不仅责任明确，便于检查评比，而且可以积累资料，掌握林木的生长规律，加快绿化速度，提高造林质量。
    幼林抚育工作和农业生产是可以密切结合起来的。结合得好，可以获得农林双丰收之效，既抚育了幼林，也增加了农业生产。实行林农间作，在林地种植一些农作物，就是一个最好的办法。山西省1957年全省极不完全的统计，林农间作五万五千多亩林地，共收粮食近二百万斤，每亩平均收粮三十五斤多，幼林的成活率也比较高。抚育幼林还可以同积肥结合起来。抚育幼林的时候锄下来的杂草，能堆制大量的肥料。贵州省思南县翁溪乡1958年抚育了二千八百五十亩幼林，积肥五百六十多万斤。群众认识到了幼林抚育的好处，生产积极性大大提高，冒着狂风暴雨在林地锄草。
    幼林抚育最繁重的工作是除草、松土。掌握好除草、松土的方法和时机，就可以用工较少而收效较大。除草要“除早、除小、除了”，这样可以省工省力。松土最好是逐步加深，在风砂区或山地还要同时培土。为了省工、省力，提高劳动效率，还要发动群众创造和改革锄草和松土的工具。
    抚育幼林的同时，要加强幼林的保护工作，防止人、畜毁坏幼林。要发动群众订立和切实遵守护林公约，经常教育群众爱护树木。
