    French Concentration Camps in Algeria
    By Our Special Correspondent Ma Manian

    On May 14th, the Ministry of Information of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria in Tunis published a telegram from the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government, Abbas, to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. The telegram described an inhuman incident:

    "Recently, when French troops were conducting a 'sweep' in the village of Tel Chioui in the Batna region, they discovered some residents hiding in a cave. French officers then ordered the use of poison gas to kill them. The majority of those hiding in the cave were women and children. All of them were killed, none survived..."

    Abbas' telegram requested the International Committee of the Red Cross to urge the French military authorities conducting the colonial war in Algeria to abide by international conventions relating to war. France is one of the signatories to this convention.

    It is not known how the International Committee of the Red Cross handled the above request, but to date, it has remained indifferent to the many crimes that continue to occur in Algeria.

    For example, according to recently revealed facts (which French newspapers have kept silent about), the French General Staff has established a military law camp in the Timfershin oasis, located 400 kilometers south of Colomb-Béchar in the Sahara Desert (French African Special Forces – Postal Zone No. 87,868). One hundred and twenty French soldiers are imprisoned in the military law camp. They are imprisoned here because they violated military discipline and were punished in their original units. 50% of the imprisoned soldiers are Algerian Muslims. However, there are also five French soldiers here who were not punished in their original units and have not undergone military trials. They were sent to the military law camp because they wrote to the French President, expressing their disagreement with continuing to fight in Algeria and their unwillingness to take up arms to massacre the Algerian people (more than thirty French young soldiers with similar circumstances have been sentenced to prison terms after military trials; the author's son, Serge Magnien, was sentenced to two years in prison for this reason). These five French soldiers, like other imprisoned soldiers, are subjected to physical and mental abuse. Cruel officers force them to carry bags full of stones weighing up to 40 kilograms, running, jumping, and crawling non-stop. They are forced to work as quarry workers, exposed to sunlight of 39 degrees in winter and 70 degrees in summer, and are often beaten by supervisors.

    The food is extremely poor, with absolutely no fresh vegetables. Scurvy and dysentery are rampant. There is no doctor in the camp. Every night, the imprisoned soldiers are ordered to dig a small pit 50 centimeters deep as their sleeping place, which they call "grave", and they must fill the pit in the morning.

    French Communist Party member of parliament, Raymond Guyot, has requested the government to explain the situation of the concentration camps and conduct a debate, because the situation of the Timfershin concentration camp is by no means an isolated case. In many concentration camps, honest French and Algerian youths are suffering torture.

    However, the cruel Algerian concentration camps are not exclusively for soldiers. In many places, Algerian civilians and Muslim farmers have been driven out of their villages and houses in the mountains and "regrouped" in concentration camps set up by French military intelligence teams—Special Administrative Groups. The camp sites are often located three kilometers, five kilometers, or even thirty kilometers away from normal residential areas.

    Even the superior authorities do not know exactly how many such "regrouping centers" exist. Because the relocation and "regrouping" of residents is handled by junior officers. It is estimated that each camp accommodates about 1,000 people. According to a recent report, the number of "regrouped" civilians reaches one million, and some estimate it to be 1.5 million. The Muslim population of Algeria is only nine million.

    The excuse for establishing concentration camps is to ensure the safety of residents, oppose the Algerian National Liberation Army, and protect residents from the propaganda of the National Liberation Front. Officials in the concentration camps declare that in the concentration camps "farmers can be free from the influence of rebels."

    This method of relocating Algerian people and gathering them near military strongholds began in 1957 when the socialist Lacoste was the Resident Minister. 1958 was a period of accelerated establishment of concentration camps, with two-thirds of the relocations being handled in that year. In order to implement General de Gaulle's plan for a total war in Algeria, the speed of forced relocation was accelerated in 1959. Officers said: "Regrouped residents are much less trouble than non-regrouped residents." It is not difficult to understand that this is equivalent to admitting that the vast majority of Algerian Muslim residents support and assist the National Liberation Army, and they yearn for independence.

    The "regrouping" process is not complicated. When the French colonialists decide to conduct a "regrouping" in a certain area, they set up some tents in a village near the military camp in the area, and then take military action to drive the residents out of their houses and into the camp. A report from "Catholic Relief Services" admits:

    "On March 24th, in a military operation, a mountainous area was surrounded. Places to accommodate 5,000 people were prepared to resettle the residents of the area. However, the number of residents in this mountainous area reached 15,000, most of whom were women and children."

    It is not difficult to imagine the situation of 15,000 people crowded into a place that can only accommodate 5,000 people.

    Six investigators from the French government recently prepared a report submitted to the French Delegate General in Algeria, Delouvrier. This report revealed the tragic experiences suffered by the Muslims of Algeria. Some major French newspapers have kept silent about this. The scope of the report is limited to the Blida, Djelfa, and Orléansville regions.

    "In all regrouped areas, people's livelihoods have been greatly affected, sometimes completely cut off."

    "The sanitary situation is very sad. In a 'village' concentrating 900 children, one child dies every day. In a camp in Auzeni, there are 600 children among the 1,100 residents. While the investigation was underway, a two-year-old child died. Officials from the Special Administrative Group pointed out that this was the third child who had died in four days. People have derived a rule from experience: when the number of residents in the regrouped area reaches 1,000, a child will inevitably die every two days."

    "...The most tragic thing is pointed out in a medical report: the general health of the residents has reached the point where medicine is ineffective."

    This is the tragic result of the French army making the residents of the "regrouped area" fall into hunger. The living standards of the residents and the various situations in the "regrouped area" pointed out in the report are appalling. The residents were forced to leave their homes and lost their livestock and poultry. They also have no wages (because most of them are elderly, weak women, and children). Sporadic and irregular relief cannot maintain their lives. The report said: "In order to clear a prohibited area, regrouping is often carried out to separate the farmers in areas that are not easy to control from the National Liberation Army. Once regrouped, contact with the original place is extremely difficult."

    "Animal husbandry has also been paralyzed due to regrouping, because feeding livestock has become impossible (in many areas this is the case). The imminent demise of animal husbandry is a negative consequence of regrouping. It means that there is absolutely no milk, eggs, or meat in the regrouped area."

    A report from "Catholic Relief Services" pointed out that 2,400 "residences" were built in a village four kilometers near Constantine. The French army had distributed some coarse-grained wheat flour here. Due to lack of funds, the distribution work stopped. According to a nurse's report, "many people have begun to fill their hunger with grass roots."

    Muslims who have been "regrouped" for political and strategic reasons are thus starved to death, eliminated by hunger, while the colonialists, the army, and the de Gaulle government are still shamelessly advocating the so-called "French Algeria."

    This is the truth about the "pacification" and "revival" work carried out by France in Algeria with the help of socialists like Lacoste and Mollet. They want to seize Algeria as their own, because in this way they can seize the Sahara oil from the hands of the North African people.

    The inhuman truth has exposed the so-called "friendship created by the army" and aroused universal indignation around the world.

    On May 17, General de Gaulle declared that the Algerian war has the "prototype of a continental war." This means that if the policies of monopoly capital believe that a war should be launched in Europe, then concentration camps and the "regrouping" of residents will become the main strategic methods.

    However, the Algerian issue cannot be resolved by war. Only by recognizing the independence of Algeria can relations between France and Algeria be improved. To achieve this goal, negotiations must be conducted to seek an end to the cruel Algerian war. (Attached picture)

### 阿尔及利亚的法国集中营

    阿尔及利亚的法国集中营
    本报特约记者　马·马尼安
    5月14日，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府宣传部在突尼斯发表了临时政府总理阿巴斯致日内瓦红十字国际委员会的电报。电文中叙述了一件惨无人道的事情：
    “最近，当法国军队在巴特拉地区特尔希乌伊村进行‘扫荡’的时候，发现一些居民躲在一个地洞里，于是法国军官下令施放毒瓦斯予以毒杀。洞内躲藏的居民大多数是妇女与儿童。他们全部被杀害，无一幸存……”
    阿巴斯的电报要求红十字国际委员会，促使在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争的法军负责当局遵守有关战争的国际公约。法国是这个公约的签字国之一。
    红十字国际委员会对于以上要求的处理不得而知，不过截至目前为止，红十字国际委员会对于阿尔及利亚境内不断地发生的许多犯罪行为，一直无动于衷。
    例如，根据最近揭露的事实（法国报纸对此一直保持沉默），法国参谋部在科隆—贝沙尔以南四百公里、撒哈拉沙漠地区的蒂姆弗希绿洲，建立了一座军法营（法兰西非洲特种部队——邮区第87，868号）。在军法营里囚禁了一百二十名法国军队的兵士。他们是因为触犯军纪、在原部队受过惩戒、现在囚禁在这里的。被囚禁的兵士50％是阿尔及利亚的穆斯林。不过，这里还有在原部队未受惩戒、未经军法审判的五名法籍兵士，他们是由于上书法国总统、表示不同意继续在阿尔及利亚作战、不愿意拿起武器屠杀阿尔及利亚人民，因而被送到军法营来的（与他们情况相似、但经过军法审判的法国青年士兵已有三十多名，本文作者的儿子塞尔奇·马尼安就因此被判了两年的徒刑）。这五名法国兵士与其他被囚禁的兵士一样，经受着身体与精神上的虐待。残暴的军官们，强迫他们背负满载重达四十公斤的石头的袋子，一停也不停地奔跑、跳跃、爬行。他们被迫曝晒在冬天为三十九度、夏天为七十度的日光之下，进行采石工人的工作，经常受着监工的毒打。
    食物极端恶劣，完全没有新鲜的蔬菜。坏血病与痢疾十分猖獗。营里没有一名医生。每天晚上，被囚禁的兵士奉命挖掘一个深为五十公分的小坑作为自己睡觉的地方，他们把它叫做“坟墓”，早上必须把小坑填平。
    法共议员雷蒙·葛约曾经要求政府说明集中营的情况，并进行辩论，因为蒂姆弗希集中营的情况，决不是个别的。在许多集中营里，正直的法国青年与阿尔及利亚青年惨受折磨。
    可是，残酷的阿尔及利亚集中营，并不完全是为兵士建立的。在许多地方，阿尔及利亚的平民、穆斯林农民被驱逐离开了自己的村子、自己在山地里的房屋，“重新集结”于法国军队特务队——特别行政组——所设立的集中营。营址往往在距离正常居住区三公里、五公里以至三十公里的地方。
    这种“重新集结的中心”究竟有多少，连上级的主管当局也不知道。因为办理居民移置和“重新集结”的是次级军官。估计每座营地约容纳一千人。根据最近的一个报告，“重新集结”的平民达一百万名，也有人估计为一百五十万名。而阿尔及利亚的穆斯林人口只有九百万名。
    设立集中营的借口是保障居民安全、反对阿尔及利亚民族解放军、保护居民不受民族解放阵线的宣传影响。集中营的官员宣称：在集中营里“农民就可以不受反叛者的影响。”
    这种移置阿尔及利亚人民、把他们集结在军事据点附近的办法，是1957年社会党人拉戈斯特担任驻节部长的时候开始的。1958年是集中营加速建立的时期，三分之二的移置工作都是在这一年办理的。为了执行夏耳将军的阿尔及利亚全面战争的计划，1959年，强迫移置的速度加快了，军官们说：“重新集结的居民同未重新集结的居民比较起来，麻烦少多了。”人们不难理解，这等于承认，绝大多数阿尔及利亚穆斯林居民拥护、协助民族解放军，他们渴望独立。
      “重新集结”的过程并不复杂。当法国殖民者决定在某一地区进行“集结”的时候，就在该区的军营附近的一个村里设立一些帐篷，然后采取军事行动，把居民从房屋里驱逐出去，赶到营地。“天主教救济会”的一份报告承认：
    “3月24日，在一次军事行动中，一个山区被包围了。人们准备了容纳五千人的地方来安置该区的居民。可是，这个山区的居民数达一万五千名，大多数为妇女和儿童。”
    不难想像一万五千人拥挤在一个只能容纳五千人的地方的情况。
    法国政府的六名调查员，最近编写了一份报告送交法国驻阿尔及利亚总代表德路弗里埃。这份报告泄漏了阿尔及利亚的穆斯林遭受的惨痛经历。法国的一些大报对此守口如瓶。报告的范围还仅限于布利达、迪阿勒特、奥兰斯维尔地区。
      “在所有的重新集结的地区里，人们的生计遭受极大的影响，有时全部断绝。”
    “卫生的情况是十分可悲的。在一个集中有九百名儿童的‘村’里每天有一名儿童死亡。在奥塞尼的一座营地的一千一百名居民中，有六百名为儿童。当调查正在进行的时候，有一名两岁的儿童死去。特别行政组的官员指出，这是四天以来死亡的第三名儿童，人们根据经验得出了一个规律：当重新集结区的居民达到一千名时，每两天就必然有一名儿童死亡。”
    “……最惨的是一个医疗报告中指出的：居民的一般健康状态，已达到医药无效的地步。”
    这就是法国军队使“重新集结区”居民陷入饥饿的悲惨结果。报告书中所指出的居民生活水准、“重新集结区”的种种情况是骇人听闻的。居民们被迫离开了故乡，失去了牲畜、家禽。他们也没有工资（因为大多数都是老弱妇孺）。零星的、不固定的救济，不能维持他们的生活。报告说：“为了肃清一个禁区，往往进行重新集结，使不容易控制的地区的农民与民族解放军脱离接触。一经集结，与原来地方的联系就极其困难了。”
    “畜牧业也因为重新集结而陷入瘫痪，因为喂养牲畜已经成了不可能的事情（在许多地区都是如此）。畜牧业的濒临绝境，是重新集结的一个恶果。它意味着在重新集结区完全没有牛奶、鸡蛋、肉类这些食物。”
    “天主教救济会”的报告指出，在君士坦丁市附近四公里的一个村子里，建筑了二千四百座“住所”。法国军队曾经在这里分发过一些粗粒小麦粉。由于缺乏资金，分发工作停止了。据护士报告说，“不少的人开始以草根充饥。”
    由于政治和战略的原故而被“重新集结”的穆斯林们，就这样活活地饿毙，为饥饿所消灭，而殖民者、军队和戴高乐政府还在无耻地鼓吹什么“法兰西的阿尔及利亚”。
    这就是在拉戈斯特、摩勒之流的社会党人协助下，法国在阿尔及利亚实行的“绥靖”、“复兴”工作的真相。他们想把阿尔及利亚据为法国所有，因为这样就可以从北非人民的手中夺去撒哈拉的石油。
    惨无人道的真相揭破了所谓“军队造成的友情”，并且激起了全世界普遍的愤慨。
    5月17日，夏耳将军宣称，阿尔及利亚战争具有“大陆战争的原型”。这就意味着如果垄断资本的政策认为应该在欧洲发动战争，那么集中营、居民的“重新集结”就会成为主要的战略方法。
    可是，阿尔及利亚问题，不是战争所能解决的。只有承认阿尔及利亚的独立，法国与阿尔及利亚的关系才会有所改善。要达到这个目的，必须进行谈判，以谋求残酷的阿尔及利亚战争的结束。（附图片）
