Title: Achieving Multiple Goals with One Action

The term "subsidiary" applied to sideline production is only in relation to grain and cotton production. In fact, in all agricultural activities, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery are all primary industries; vigorously developing sideline production is by no means "neglecting the main business." Putting sideline production in a relatively secondary position does not mean it is dispensable. People's lives are becoming increasingly rich, and their needs are also diverse. Taking food as an example, in addition to grain, everyone wants to eat various non-staple foods such as chicken, duck, fish, and shrimp. When the weather gets hot, parents want to buy their children exquisitely woven small straw hats; sleeping mats and palm-leaf fans are essential for every household; and when storing clothes, people think of using camphor. Everyone needs a pair of chopsticks for eating. In the rainy season in the south, people cannot do without rain capes and bamboo hats when working in the rain... None of these can be separated from sideline production. They are inextricably linked to people's living needs. In the future, with the development of production and the daily improvement of life, people will have more and more demands for sideline production.

The Party pointed out in the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" that great attention should be paid to accelerating the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and that a full-scale revolution must be carried out in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. Here, the development of sideline production is elevated to a very important position. Developing a diversified economy—including the development of sideline production—is a very important aspect of the development of production in people's communes. Because sideline production is mostly commodity production, communes can quickly increase cash income from these aspects, which can be used as production funds or as wages for commune members. Therefore, grasping sideline production often achieves multiple goals with one action.

Some people say, "One hand cannot catch two fish," and that grasping sideline production will affect agricultural production. In fact, the practice in many places has proved that when arranging labor, according to local conditions, distinguishing between primary and secondary priorities, and developing some sideline industries in a manner appropriate to the time and place, will not only not affect agricultural production but also make up for the lack of agricultural funds and promote the development of agricultural production. Today's report in this newspaper on the development of diversified operations in various parts of Hunan powerfully proves this point. There are many opportunities for sideline production in summer. As long as we adopt the method of "doing a lot when not busy and doing a little when busy," make overall plans, and uniformly arrange labor, we can appropriately develop sideline production. If we do not promptly organize forces to make a concentrated effort on some seasonal sideline industries (such as medicinal materials, palm-leaf fans, etc.), we will miss the opportunity. This is not only a loss for the commune and its members, but it will also affect market supply and cause many inconveniences in production and life.

In developing sideline production, various localities have put forward the slogan "Rely on the mountains to eat the mountains, and rely on the water to eat the water" and the principle of "large-scale projects are done collectively, and small-scale projects are distributed to households." This approach of dividing the scope of operations through mass discussions is very correct and necessary. Because there are many types of sideline industries, and most of them are manual labor, commune members can fully utilize their spare time to operate a part of them. If everything is concentrated and operated by the commune or production team, it will be detrimental. By dividing the scope of operations through mass discussions and simultaneously promoting collectively and privately operated sideline industries, we can comprehensively mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and develop sideline production more and better. After discussions among commune members, the Shisun Production Team of the Xinshidu People's Commune in Yiyang County, Hunan, handed over ten major sideline industries such as fishing to specialized teams, and arranged more than twenty minor sideline industries such as splitting chopsticks, making brooms, and making straw sandals for individual commune members to operate. Everyone is very enthusiastic. This approach is worth promoting in various localities.

### 一举数得

    一举数得
    副业生产名之曰“副”，只不过是同粮棉生产相对而言。其实，在全部农事活动中，农林牧副渔五业无一不是正业；大抓副业生产决不是“不务正业”。把副业放在比较次要的地位，并不是说它可有可无。人们的生活内容日益丰富，需要也是多种多样的。以吃的而论，除了粮食之外，大家都愿意吃到鸡鸭鱼虾等各种副食品。天气热了，父母都愿意给孩子买上一顶编织精致的小草帽；凉席和蒲扇是每家必备之物；收藏衣服又想到要用樟脑。吃饭的筷子人人都要有一双。南方多雨季节冒雨生产更离不开蓑衣和笠帽……以上种种，没有一样能离开副业生产。它们同人们的生活需要有千丝万缕的连系。今后随着生产的发展与生活的一天天提高，人们对于副业生产的要求会愈来愈多。
    党在“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出，要极大地注意加速林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的发展，一定要在农林牧副渔五业中来一个全线大革命。在这里，副业的发展被提到了很重要的地位。发展多种经济——其中包括发展副业生产，是人民公社发展生产的一个很重要的方面。由于副业生产多半是商品性的生产，公社从这些方面可以较快地增加现金收入，可以作为生产资金，也可作为工资发放给社员。因此，抓住副业生产，往往一举数得。
    有人说：“一双手捉不了两条鱼”，抓副业会影响农业生产。其实，许多地方的实践证明：在安排劳力时，根据当地条件，分清主次先后，因时因地制宜地搞一些副业，不仅不会影响农业生产，而且能补农业资金之不足，促进农业生产的发展。今天本报发表的湖南各地开展多种经营的消息，有力地证明了这点。夏季副业门路较多，只要采取“小忙大搞，大忙小搞”的办法，全面规划，统一安排劳力，就能适当地搞起副业生产。有些季节性强的副业（如药材、蒲扇等），如果不及时组织力量突击，就会失去时机。这不仅是公社和社员的一笔损失，也会影响市场供应，造成生产和生活上的许多不方便。
    在开展副业生产中，各地提出“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”的口号，提出“大宗集体干，小宗分到户”的原则，通过群众讨论，划分经营范围，这种作法是十分正确和必要的。因为副业种类繁多，又多半是手工劳动，社员完全可以利用工余时间来经营一部分。如果全部集中由公社或生产队经营，反而不利。通过群众讨论，划分了经营范围，集体和私人经营的副业同时并举，就可以全面地调动群众的积极性，更多更好地开展副业生产。湖南益阳县新市渡人民公社石笋生产队经过社员讨论把捕鱼等十项大宗副业交专业队经营，还有劈筷子、做扫帚、打草鞋等二十多项小宗副业安排给社员个人经营，大家积极性都很高。这种作法是值得各地推广的。
