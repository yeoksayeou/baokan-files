Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th June: The Zhaopingtai Reservoir on the Sha River, a major tributary of the Huai River, has entered the decisive phase of construction. The average height of the dam has reached 170 meters. All personnel are advancing victoriously, vigorously reforming tools, and racing against the floodwaters to comprehensively rush the dam to a safe elevation of 176 meters by late June, ensuring that it can block and store floods that occur once every fifty years during the flood season.

The Zhaopingtai Reservoir is located in Lushan County, Henan Province, and is the first-level water conservancy hub for the comprehensive utilization and cascade development of the Sha River. After the reservoir is completed, it can block and store 677 million cubic meters of floodwater from 1,500 square kilometers in the upper reaches of the Sha River.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th June: The Baiguishan Reservoir, built in the suburbs of Pingdingshan City, Henan Province, has successfully completed its first phase of construction. Currently, a small number of remaining laborers are pouring the flood discharge gate project and preparing for the second phase of construction.

The Baiguishan Reservoir is the second water conservancy hub below the Zhaopingtai Reservoir on the Sha River, a major tributary of the Huai River. Construction began on December 10th last year. After the entire reservoir project is completed, it can block and store 630 million cubic meters of floodwater from the Sha River, supply cooling water for the Pingdingshan City thermal power plant and industrial water for coal washing in the Pingdingshan mining area, and irrigate 1.8 million mu of farmland. It will also play a huge role in developing Sha River navigation and flood prevention.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 15th June: The first phase of the F抚 River diversion project in Jiangxi Province has been successfully completed. From now on, floodwaters from the F抚 River during the flood season will be blocked by a towering earth dam at Rengang in Nanchang County and flow eastward along a newly excavated river channel two kilometers in front of the dam, flowing into Poyang Lake.

The diverted F抚 River, by straightening the route into the lake, avoids the backflow caused by the Poyang Lake flood level on the F抚 River, eliminating a major concern for the people on both banks of the F抚 River.

The F抚 River diversion is one of the key flood control and drainage projects of the Ganfu Plain comprehensive development project. The first phase of the F抚 River diversion project, which has been successfully completed, accounts for more than 90% of the total diversion project.

The Ganfu Plain is the largest plain in Jiangxi, covering an area of 2,000 square kilometers, including the five counties of Nanchang, Fengcheng, Qingjiang, Linchuan, and Jinxian, and Nanchang City. The land on the plain is fertile, but it is threatened by floods from the Gan River, F抚 River, Poyang Lake, and mountain streams every year, making it a major flood-stricken area in Jiangxi. In order to fundamentally eliminate waterlogging disasters on the Ganfu Plain, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided in 1957 to construct the Ganfu Plain water conservancy comprehensive development project.

    拦蓄沙河夏季洪水
    河南昭平台水库进入施工决战阶段
    江西抚河改道第一期工程胜利完工
    据新华社郑州15日电　淮河大支流沙河上的昭平台水库，已进入施工的决战阶段。水库大坝平均已筑到一百七十公尺高程。全体员工正在乘胜前进，大搞工具改革，与洪水赛跑，以便在6月下旬把大坝全面抢筑到一百七十六公尺安全高程，确保在伏汛期能够拦蓄五十年一遇的洪水。
    昭平台水库在河南鲁山县，是沙河综合利用、梯级开发的第一级水利枢纽。这座水库建成后，可拦蓄沙河上游一千五百平方公里六亿七千七百万公方的洪水。
    据新华社郑州15日电　兴建在河南平顶山市郊的白龟山水库已经胜利完成第一期工程。目前，留下的小部分民工正在浇筑泄洪闸工程，进行第二期施工准备工作。
    白龟山水库是淮河大支流沙河昭平台水库以下的第二个水利枢纽。在去年12月10日开始施工。水库工程全部完成后，可以拦蓄沙河洪水六亿三千万公方，供平顶山市火力发电站冷却用水和平顶山矿区洗煤等工业用水，灌溉一百八十万亩农田，对发展沙河航运和防洪也将起到巨大作用。
    据新华社南昌15日电　江西抚河改道第一期工程胜利完工。从此，抚河汛期洪水就在南昌县荏港被一座巍然屹立的大土坝堵住去路，顺着在坝前两公里处开挖的新河道折向东流，注入鄱阳湖。
    改道后的抚河，因取直了入湖路线，就避免了鄱阳湖洪水位对抚河的顶托倒灌，解除了抚河两岸人民的心腹大患。
    抚河改道是赣抚平原综合开发工程防洪除涝重点工程之一。已经胜利完成的抚河改道第一期工程，占改道工程总量的90％以上。
    赣抚平原是江西最大的平原，面积二千平方公里，包括南昌、丰城、清江、临川、进贤五县和南昌市。平原上土地肥沃，但是年年受着赣江、抚河、鄱阳湖及山溪等方面来的洪水的威胁，是江西主要水患地区。为了从根本上消除赣抚平原的水涝灾害，中共江西省委在1957年决定了兴修赣抚平原的水利综合开发工程。
