Lufeng County's Jinshan Commune Vigorously Grabs Summer Field Cultivation; Adjusts Labor Organization According to Production Needs

    (Our dispatch) Yunnan's Lufeng County Jinshan Commune, upon completing transplanting and entering the stage of inter-tillage, promptly adjusted its labor organization in response to the complex and variable characteristics of summer production.

    The basic requirements for the Jinshan Commune's labor organization adjustment are to have both professionalism and flexibility; to have both specialized division of labor and to ensure the completion of crash tasks. The organizational form is based on the production team as a unit, organizing several comprehensive groups; under the comprehensive groups, specialized groups for weeding rice, topdressing fertilizer, accumulating fertilizer, field management, and odd jobs (standby) are organized according to the characteristics and size of the task. Under normal circumstances, each is responsible for their respective tasks, and when weeding or topdressing fertilizer becomes urgent, concentrated efforts are made.

    In order to mobilize the masses to participate in management, the second management area of this commune, after dividing the area into large groups for contracted responsibility, also allowed commune members to form small groups of three to five people. The production team also specifically defined the tasks to individuals, and contracted it until the autumn harvest. After completing the tasks on time and with quality, the members can freely handle the extra time.

    Through the above organizational forms and management methods, the personal responsibility of field management is combined with the mass management, and the cadres are combined with the masses, creating a new atmosphere in which everyone cares about production and cadres and the masses are twisted into one rope.

    禄丰县金山公社狠抓夏田中耕
    按生产需要调整劳动组织
    本报讯　云南禄丰县金山公社，在结束栽插转入中耕的时候，根据夏季生产复杂多变的特点，及时调整了劳动组织。
    金山公社调整劳动组织的基本要求，是既要有专业性，又要有灵活性；既要有专业分工，又要保证能完成突击任务。组织形式是以生产队为单位，组织若干综合组；在综合组下又按工种特点和任务大小，组织了薅秧、追肥、积肥、田间管理、杂活（机动）等专业组。在一般情况下，就各司其责，在薅秧或追肥紧张的时候，就集中突击。
    为了发动群众参加管理，这个公社的第二管理区在划片包干到大组后，又让社员三至五人组成小组。生产队并把任务具体定到个人，一直包到秋收。在按时、按质完成任务后，多余的时间社员可以自由处理。
    通过上述组织形式和管理办法，就把田间管理的专人负责和群众性的管理结合起来了，把干部和群众结合起来了，出现了人人关心生产，干部群众扭成一条绳的新气象。　（陈勇进）
