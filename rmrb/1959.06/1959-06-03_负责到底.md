Be Responsible to the End

There are two attitudes towards product quality: one is to manage both production and usage, being responsible to the end once the product leaves the factory; the other is to only manage production, not usage, taking no responsibility once the product leaves the factory.

Which attitude is correct? Of course, it is the former. Because the production of products is not an end in itself; all products are for use, whether they are means of production or means of subsistence. If a product is produced but cannot be used, it is a waste product, which not only fails to increase social wealth but also causes waste, and even brings incalculable serious consequences, harming production and construction, and endangering personal safety.

The workers in the Shenyang machinery manufacturing industry understand this principle very well. When manufacturing more than two hundred kinds of high-grade products, they adopted a serious and meticulous attitude of repeated inspection and repeated testing; after the products left the factory, they also sent special personnel to follow the products to the user units to conduct quality inspections and operation tests, being responsible to the end. This spirit deserves great promotion.

Many products cannot guarantee quality through simple inspection; they require someone to guard every level to block loopholes and meet standards. Especially new products, which require repeated inspection and repeated testing. Otherwise, a slight error can have endless harm.

Production enterprises produce thousands of products, and it is difficult to ask all production units to follow the products to inspect the quality; however, the spirit of meticulousness and being responsible to the end must be integrated into every production unit and every production link. For those pivotal and important products, it is imperative to resolutely follow the products out of the factory, inspect the quality, and be responsible to the end.

### 负责到底

    负责到底
    对待产品质量有两种态度：一种是，既管生产，又管使用，产品出门，负责到底；另一种是，只管生产，不管使用，产品出门，概不负责。
    那种态度是正确的？当然是前者。因为产品的生产不是目的，一切产品都是为了使用的，不管是属于生产资料的产品也好，属于生活资料的产品也好。如果产品生产出来不能使用，就是废品，这不仅不能为社会增加财富，而且造成浪费，甚至带来难以估计的严重后果，危害生产建设，危害人身安全。
    沈阳机械制造业的职工很懂得这个道理。他们在制造二百多种高级产品的时候，采取了严肃认真、反复检查、反复试验，一丝不苟的态度；在产品出厂以后，还派专人跟随产品到使用单位进行质量检查和运转试验、负责到底。这种精神，值得大大提倡。
    很多产品不是经过简单的检查就能保证质量的，需要道道关口有人把守，才能堵塞漏洞，达到标准。特别是新产品，更需要反复检查，反复试验。否则，稍有差错，贻害无穷。
    生产企业的产品千千万万，要求所有的生产单位都跟随产品下去检查质量，这是很难办到的；然而一丝不苟、负责到底的精神，必须贯串在每个生产单位、每个生产环节，对于那些举足轻重的重要产品则必须坚决跟随产品出厂，检查质量，负责到底。
