Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th: Hunan is expanding the planting of food crops according to local conditions, striving to plant more for higher yields. The province's arable land for grain crops has increased by 3 million mu compared to the original plan, of which more than 2.53 million mu have already been planted with mid-season rice, sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum and other crops.

Various places generally adopt different methods to expand the planting of food crops based on the principle of adapting to local conditions. You County originally planned to plant 127,000 mu of economic crops. After inspection, it was found that the sowing season for some crops had passed and some soil was unsuitable. Therefore, it was decided to reasonably adjust the land use plan and convert 8,900 mu of it to rice cultivation. The county also promoted the practice of planting economic crops on the mountains, utilizing 2,129 mu of mountain slopes for this purpose. In the Dongting Lake area, many counties have fertile lakeside wasteland, which used to be flooded and unsuitable for planting crops. This year, there is less waterlogging, so farmers have drained the water and used the land to grow food crops. In higher areas outside the dikes, they have also planted deep-water rice, sorghum, and other crops. The Changde area has expanded the planting of food crops by more than 150,000 mu in the eight counties bordering the lake. In southern and western Hunan, there are a large number of forest lands. This year, the integration of agriculture and forestry is being widely promoted. By the end of May, the province had intercropped 2.2 million mu of oil tea, tung oil, and other forest lands with millet, sorghum, corn, and other crops. In addition, grain crops have also been planted on both sides of newly built railway subgrades that cannot be paved before autumn, and inside and outside reservoirs that have not been completed and cannot store water.

While planning to expand the planting area, various places are also preparing seeds, accumulating fertilizer, and organizing manpower and cattle power to sow in a timely manner, in order to strive for high yields. In Panxi Brigade of Anchang Commune, Anxiang County, more than 200 laborers were mobilized to expand the planting of lakeside wasteland, forming specialized teams for water pumping, plowing, and rush transplanting. They plowed and transplanted simultaneously, finishing one plot at a time. In just four days, they rushed to transplant rice on more than 470 mu. Some communes in Yuanling County adopted the method of stationing labor, cattle, tools, cadres, offices, canteens, nurseries, health workers, peddlers, and studying "Ten Ascents to the Mountain," establishing camps and carrying out mountain assaults. Guanzhuang Commune completed the integrated agriculture and forestry cultivation of 13,700 mu in just ten days.

Now, various places are rushing to plant the unplanted arable land and strengthening cultivation management of the planted land, striving for a bumper harvest.

This newspaper Hefei 10th dispatch: Anhui Province peasants are making full use of the gaps in land around houses, beside fields and ponds, and in wasteland and barren areas, planting melons, vegetables, beans, sunflowers, castor beans and crops, which is everywhere green, making it impossible for a scrap of land to be wasted, for any barren land to be barren.

According to statistics at the end of May, the total area of ​​gaps in land used throughout the province has reached more than 4 million mu. If the average yield per mu increases by 150 jin to 200 jin, the province can increase grain production by 600 million jin to 800 million jin.

Under the call of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, this year, peasants in various places have made full use of the gaps in land to plant melons, vegetables, and crops, striving to plant more and harvest more. The Bengbu area has used 1,389,000 mu of gaps in land to grow vegetables, with an average of 1.8 li per person. The entire area has more than 400 million pumpkin plants alone, an average of 53 per person. Tongcheng County in the Anqing area has used more than 100,000 mu of field ridges, dike ridges, wasteland, house edges, and small ditches to grow melons, vegetables, and miscellaneous grains. Huaiwang County has a lot of lakeside wasteland in Huayang Commune. This commune reclaimed 4,480 mu of wasteland according to local conditions, planting rice, sorghum, and corn.

In order to ensure the full utilization of gaps in land, in addition to explaining the significance of using gaps in land to strive for more planting and more harvesting to the masses, various places in Anhui Province have also taken various measures to solve specific difficulties such as the lack of seeds. For example, Tongcheng County transferred more than 210,000 jin of sorghum, soybeans, peanuts and other seeds from the warehouse and distributed them to production teams in a timely manner. The commercial departments of Suixi County also transferred more than 130,000 jin of castor seeds, sunflower seeds and other seeds to allow various communes and production teams to use gaps in land for production. Some places also mobilized commune members to exchange seeds at equal prices to overcome the difficulty of insufficient seeds.

Now, while continuing to advance towards gaps in land, various places are also actively managing the melons, vegetables, and crops that have already been planted in gaps in land. Lingbi County has universally fertilized, weeded, and irrigated the 197,000 mu of melons and vegetables that have been planted more than twice. The Qianrenqiao Brigade of the Qianrenqiao Commune in Shucheng County proposed the slogan "Plant a piece, harvest a piece, plant a tree, harvest a tree," strengthening management, and more than 80% of the gaps in land are well managed.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 10th: People's communes in many mountainous and semi-mountainous areas of Zhejiang Province are vigorously intercropping miscellaneous grains in forest land while nurturing young forests of Chinese fir, oil tea, and tung oil.

According to recent incomplete statistics, the province has intercropped a total of 172,000 mu of corn, sweet potatoes, adzuki beans, mung beans, and millet in young forest land. Ruian County has intercropped more than 30,000 mu of sweet potatoes, soybeans, corn, and peanuts in forest land. Changle Production Team of Chengtan Commune in Sheng County has completed the intercropping of 626 mu of forest land, and the crops planted are growing vigorously. Qu County has intercropped 11,405 mu of oil tea and tung oil forests with corn and other crops. In order to ensure the quality of intercropping, Fangcun Commune in this county, in addition to establishing professional organizations, also established a production responsibility system of "special personnel to the mountain, work points to the mountain, quotas to the mountain, quality to the mountain." Now, the entire commune has intercropped more than 2,130 mu of corn and other miscellaneous grains.

Various places in Zhejiang Province have attached great importance to the work of intercropping in forest land this year. As early as mid-April, the Wenzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office organized a work team to conduct pilot projects in Pingyang County. In May, various counties in the Jinhua area made specific arrangements for the work of intercropping in forest land according to the instructions of the District Party Committee. Sheng County, Tiantai and other counties also specifically held on-site meetings on intercropping.

Farmers in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang Province have always had the habit of intercropping miscellaneous grains and other crops in forest land. Intercropping miscellaneous grains and other crops in forest land can not only increase income, but also promote the growth of trees, and the harvesting time can be advanced by at least five years. After intercropping in young forest land, the survival rate can be greatly improved. Last year, the survival rate of Chinese fir island forests built in Lishui County reached 98% after intercropping with miscellaneous grains, while the survival rate without intercropping was only about 75%.

    多种一分地　多收一分粮
    湖南扩大种植面积  安徽利用零星土地  浙江实行林地套种
    据新华社长沙10日电　湖南各地因地制宜扩种粮食作物，力争多种高产多收。全省粮食耕地面积比原计划增加了三百万亩，其中二百五十三万多亩已经种上了中稻、红薯、玉米、高粱等作物。
    各地一般都根据因地制宜的原则，采取不同的办法来扩种粮食作物。攸县原来计划种植经济作物十二万七千亩，经过检查，发现有的作物播种季节已过，有的土质不合，于是决定合理调整耕地使用计划，将其中的八千九百亩改种水稻。全县并推行经济作物上山的办法，利用山坡地种植经济作物二千一百二十九亩。洞庭湖区各县有不少肥沃的湖荒田亩，往年积水深，没有种植作物。今年渍水少，农民们便排干渍水，用来种粮食作物。在堤外地势较高的地方，也种上深水稻、高粱等作物。常德专区滨湖八个县就这样扩种了十五万多亩粮食作物。湘南、湘西有大批的林地，今年普遍推广农林间作。到5月下旬，全省已在油茶、油桐等林地里间种粟米、高粱、玉米等二百二十万亩。另外，在一些秋前不能铺轨的新修铁路路基两旁和没有完工不能蓄水的水库内外，也种上了粮食作物。
    各地一面规划扩种的土地，一面就准备种子，增积肥料，组织人力和牛力及时播种，以争取高产多收。安乡县安昌公社潘溪大队在扩种湖荒田亩中，出动了二百多个劳力，分别组成车水、翻耕、抢插、抢修专业组，边车边耕边插，耕好一丘插一丘，只四天功夫就抢插水稻四百七十多亩。沅陵县有些公社采取劳力、耕牛、工具、干部、办公室、食堂、托儿所、保健员、货郎担和学习“十上山”的办法，安营扎寨，坐山突击。官庄公社仅十天时间，就完成农林结合的耕作面积一万三千七百亩。
    现在各地对未种完的耕地正在抢种，对已种下的正加强培育管理，争取丰收。
    本报合肥10日电　安徽省农民充分利用家前屋后、田埂塘边、荒滩、荒地等空隙土地，种上瓜菜、豆类、向日葵、蓖麻和庄稼，到处一片青绿，做到了废地不废、荒地不荒。
    据5月底的统计，全省利用的空隙地总计已有四百多万亩，如果平均每亩增产粮食一百五十斤到二百斤，全省即可增产粮食六亿斤到八亿斤。
    在中共安徽省委的号召下，今年各地农民充分利用空隙地种植瓜菜和农作物，力争多种多收。蚌埠专区利用空隙地种菜一百三十八万九千亩，平均每人一分八厘。全专区单是种南瓜就有四亿多棵，平均每人五十三棵。安庆专区的桐城县利用田埂、圩埂、荒滩、宅边、小沟塘等十万多亩种了瓜菜和杂粮。怀望县华阳公社湖荒地很多。这个公社就因地制宜开垦荒田四千四百八十多亩，种上了水稻、高粱和玉米。
    为了保证充分利用空隙地，安徽省各地除了向群众说明利用空隙地争取多种多收的意义外，还采取了各种办法解决缺乏种子等具体困难问题。如桐城县就从仓库中调出高粱、大豆、花生等种籽二十一万多斤，及时发到生产队。濉溪县商业部门也调出蓖麻籽、向日葵等种籽十三万多斤，给各个公社生产队利用空隙地生产。有些地方还发动社员以等价交换办法互相调剂，克服种籽不足的困难。
    现在，各地一面继续向空隙地进军，一面积极管理在空隙地上已经种下的瓜菜和农作物。灵壁县已种的十九万七千亩瓜菜已普遍追肥、锄草、灌溉两遍以上，舒城县千人桥公社千人桥大队提出“种一块收一块，栽一棵收一棵”的口号，加强管理，80％以上的空隙地都管理得很好。
    新华社杭州10日电　浙江省许多山区和半山区的人民公社在抚育杉树、油茶、油桐等幼林的同时，大力在林地套种杂粮。
    根据最近的不完全统计，全省在幼林地里套种的玉米、甘薯、赤豆、绿豆和小米共计有十七万二千亩。瑞安县已在林地套种了三万多亩甘薯、大豆、玉米和花生。嵊县澄潭公社长乐生产队已完成林地套种六百二十六亩，所种的农作物生长都很茁壮。衢县已在油茶和油桐林内套种了玉米等作物一万一千四百零五亩。这个县的芳村公社为了保证套种的质量，除了建立专业组织以外，还订立了“专人到山、工分到山、指标到山、质量到山”的生产责任制，现在全社已套种玉米等杂粮二千一百三十多亩。
    浙江省各地今年对林地套种工作十分重视。温州专署早在4月中旬就组织工作组到平阳县搞试点。金华专区各县在5月间根据地委指示对林地套种工作作了具体安排。嵊县，天台等县还专门开了套种的现场会议。
    浙江省山区农民一向有在林地套种杂粮和其他农作物的习惯。在林地套种杂粮等农作物，不仅可以增加收入，而且能促进林木的生长，采伐时间至少可以提早五年。幼林地在套种以后，成活率可以大大提高。丽水县去年营造的杉木岛林套种了杂粮以后，成活率达到98％，没经过套种的，成活率只有75％左右。（附图片）
