Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 18th: Xieng Khouang news from Laos: According to the “Xieng Khouang Lao Patriotic Newspaper” on June 15th, on June 11th, 12th, and 13th, the Lao Royal Army launched multiple attacks on units of the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces in Muong, Tham Xum, Suang, Ba Bien, Sam Sang, Long Ho, Tham?, and other areas. The aforementioned units of the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces conducted heroic self-defense combat.

According to reports, in the areas where fighting occurred, the people were extremely indignant at the barbarous acts of robbery, rape, arrests, and torture committed by the Lao Royal Government Army. They have implemented a scorched earth policy to deal with the Royal Government Army. Local people have also established many self-defense teams, ready to conduct self-defense combat to protect their lives and property, protect production, and repel the brutal “sweeps” by the Royal Government Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 18th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, which today published news from the Vietnam-Laos border, the Lao Royal Government’s army is still attacking the Lao Fighting Forces. Fighting is continuing in the southeast of Xieng Khouang. Fighting occurred in Di Meng township on June 14th. Gunfire could be heard on the Vietnamese border.

Because the Lao Royal Army wantonly suppresses the people wherever they go, the people in many places are forced to flee. In recent days, some women and children from Xieng Khouang have fled to Vietnam to seek refuge. (Attached image)

    新华社河内18日电　老挝川圹消息：据“川圹老挝爱国报”6月15日报道，6月11日、12日、13日，老挝王国军队对寮国战斗部队第二营在木恩乡、探巡、苏行、巴边、三椥、龙虎、探?等地的单位发动多次进攻。寮国战斗部队第二营的上述单位进行了英勇的自卫战斗。
    据报道，在发生战斗的地区，人民对老挝王国政府军队的抢劫、奸淫、逮捕和拷打的野蛮行为非常愤慨。他们已经实行坚壁清野来对付王国政府军队。当地人民还成立了许多自卫队，准备进行自卫战斗来保卫他们的生命财产，保卫生产，反击王国政府军队的残暴“扫荡”。
    新华社河内18日电　据越南通讯社今天发表来自越南—老挝边境的消息说，老挝王国政府的军队仍在进攻寮国战斗部队。川圹东南面的战斗在继续进行。迪门乡6月14日发生了战斗。越南边境上可以听到枪声。
    由于老挝王国军队每到一个地方都大肆镇压人民，许多地方的老百姓被迫逃难。近几天来，有一些川圹的妇女和儿童逃到越南境内避难。（附图片）
