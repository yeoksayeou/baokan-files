This newspaper, Wuhan, June 25th: Daye Steel Plant's electric furnace workshop combines the establishment of sound technical management systems with vigorous technical innovation, making the technical management systems more practical, and the quality and output of steel have increased month by month. In April, the accident scrap rate decreased by 42.5% compared to March, the chemical scrap rate decreased by 24.4%, the on-specification production rate increased from 75% to 92.9%, and the daily output increased from 246 tons to 255 tons. In May, the steel qualification rate increased by 2.43% compared to April; from June 1st to 24th, the steel qualification rate increased by another 0.29% compared to the same period in May. Now, this workshop has completed the steel production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule.

This electric furnace workshop launched a mass movement two years ago to establish a relatively sound set of technical management systems and operating procedures. The quality of electric furnace steel once ranked first in the country in 1957 and the first quarter of 1958. Later, for a period of time, these systems became disorganized, and the quality of steel declined.

In the process of improving rules and regulations, this workshop mobilized the masses to speak out, debate, and put forward rationalization proposals, incorporating newly created successful operating experiences and feasible technical innovation suggestions into the operating procedures. Workers at the No. 6 electric furnace, in response to the high sulfur content of the local iron ore, proposed adding soda ash to the furnace to remove sulfur. After testing, it was proved that this method was very efficient in removing sulfur. Adding 0.5% soda ash to the molten steel could remove 44.5% of the sulfur, and the smelting time for each furnace of steel was also shortened by half an hour compared to using lime to remove sulfur. For smelting carbon structural steel, the original operating procedure stipulated a reduction period of 45 minutes, but according to the actual operating experience of the workers, it often did not take 45 minutes. After debate, this article was appropriately modified. Through mass voicing of opinions, debates, and experiments, this workshop not only restored and improved the original technical management systems such as smelting operating procedures, quality analysis, and post responsibility systems, but also added operating procedures for smelting ball bearing steel and some other technical management systems.

In order to ensure that the operating procedures are conscientiously implemented, the electric furnace workshop also included the implementation of operating procedures together with indicators such as output and quality as conditions for labor competitions, and conducted regular inspections and evaluations.

This newspaper, Wuhan, June 25th: Daye Steel Plant's forging workshop, in accordance with the spirit of combining vigorous mass movements with strengthened scientific management, mobilized the masses to formulate new operating procedures, eliminated long-standing quality accidents such as decarburization and cracks in high-quality forged steel, and made a double leap in the quality and output of high-quality forged steel. Since this workshop implemented the new operating procedures in the second half of March, the quality of high-quality forged steel has reached the national standard of 99.95%, and the output has also completed the plan month by month. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party are promoting the experience of this workshop in various factories and mines.

Daye Steel Plant's forging workshop specializes in producing high-quality forged steel, which requires strict quality. However, since the workshop was expanded and completed in August last year and put into production, quality accidents such as decarburization, cracks, and uneven carbonization in the steel often occurred, which became the main obstacle to fully completing the production plan.

The workshop's process regulation reform committee, through inspection and analysis, found that the important reason why quality problems had not been resolved for a long time was that the operating procedures formulated by the workshop last year mechanically used the operating experience of foreign factories, a part of which was divorced from the actual production of the workshop, and the reasonable parts were not conscientiously implemented. The workshop's party branch reported the problems existing in product quality to all employees in early March, and mobilized the masses to speak out, debate, and argue extensively. Based on their actual operating experience, the workers put forward more than 150 suggestions on preventing decarburization and other quality accidents. The workshop branch used the "three-in-one combination" method to carefully study and analyze the opinions of the masses, and conducted experiments to incorporate successful experiences into the operating procedures. According to the old operating procedures, the chamber heating furnace in the workshop could only load eight steel ingots per furnace, which often caused the forging hammer to stop waiting for materials, affecting the completion of the output plan. Workers had broken through the prescribed quantity, loading up to 48 ingots per furnace, but this required increasing the furnace temperature and prolonging the time the steel ingots stayed at high temperature, which easily led to decarburization. In the debate, some advocated loading less, and some advocated loading more. The workshop leaders, based on the furnace temperature, heating time, and specifications of the forgings, conducted multiple experiments in the Yang Yupei group, and found a method of loading 20 pieces for billets cut into two (i.e., one steel ingot cut into two steel materials), 25 pieces for billets cut into four, and 30 pieces for billets cut into five. This not only made it possible to load more and produce more, but also controlled the residence time of the steel ingots at high temperature. The decarburization layer of 100 mm steel was only 0.32 mm, which was smaller than the national standard of 1.35 mm, and the quality was qualified. This new operating method was incorporated into the operating procedures.

After conducting on-site experiments and technical appraisals on the opinions raised by employees, the forging workshop revised and supplemented the original operating procedures and added heating procedures for steel that is prone to decarburization. In this way, the operating procedures were in line with the actual production.

    把成功的操作经验纳入规程
    大冶钢厂两车间质量产量一起提高
    本报武汉25日电　大冶钢厂电炉车间把健全技术管理制度和大闹技术革新结合起来，使技术管理制度更加切合实际，钢的质量、产量逐月上升。4月份的事故废品比3月份减少42.5％，化学废品减少24.4％，按品种生产由75％提高到92.9％，日产量由二百四十六吨提高到二百五十五吨。5月份钢的合格率比4月份提高2.43％；6月份到24日止，钢的合格率又比5月同期提高0.29％。现在，这个车间已经提前完成了上半年钢的产量计划。
    这个电炉车间曾在两年前发动群众建立了一套比较健全的技术管理制度和操作规程，电炉钢的质量在1957年和1958年第一季度曾获得全国第一。后来有一段时间，这些制度形成自流，钢的质量下降了。
    这个车间在健全规章制度的过程中，发动群众鸣放辩论，提合理化建议，把群众新创造的成功的操作经验和可行的技术革新建议纳入操作规程。六号电炉工人针对土铁硫高的情况，提出在炉里加曹达粉去硫，经过试验证明，这种办法去硫的效率很高，在钢水中加0.5％的曹达粉，就能除掉44.5％的硫，每炉钢的冶炼时间也比用石灰去硫缩短半小时。炼炭素结构钢，原操作规程规定还原期为四十五分钟，但是根据工人实际操作经验，往往要不了四十五分钟，经过辩论，把这条作了适当修改。通过群众性的鸣放辩论和试验，这个车间不仅恢复和健全了原来的冶炼操作规程、质量分析和岗位责任制等技术管理制度，还增加了炼滚珠钢的操作规程和一部分其他的技术管理制度。
    为了使操作规程认真贯彻执行，电炉车间还把执行操作规程同产量、质量等指标一起列为劳动竞赛条件，定期进行检查、评比。（张冠五）
    本报武汉25日电　大冶钢厂锻造车间根据大搞群众运动和加强科学管理相结合的精神，发动群众制订了新的操作规程，消除了优质锻钢材长期存在的脱炭和裂纹等质量事故，使优质锻钢材的质量产量双双跃进。这个车间从3月下半月执行新的操作规程以来，优质锻钢材的质量达到了99.95％的国家指标，产量也月月完成计划。中共湖北省委和中共黄石市委正在各厂矿企业推广这车间的经验。
    大冶钢厂锻造车间专门生产优质锻钢材，质量要求严格。但是这个车间从去年8月扩建竣工投入生产以后，常常发生钢材脱炭、裂纹、钢中炭化物不均匀等质量事故，这成了全面完成生产计划的主要障碍。
    车间的工艺规程改革委员会通过检查分析，发现质量问题长期没有解决的重要原因，是去年车间制订的操作规程只是机械搬用了外厂的操作经验，有一部分和本车间生产实际脱节，合理的部分也没有认真贯彻执行。车间党支部在3月上旬把产品质量方面存在的问题向全体职工交底，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论。工人群众根据自己的实际操作经验，提出了防止脱炭和其他质量事故的建议一百五十多条。车间支部运用“三结合”的方法，对群众意见进行了仔细的研究分析，并且进行了试验，把成功的经验纳入操作规程。车间的室式加热炉，按照旧操作规程的规定，每炉只装八根钢锭，常使锻锤停工待料，影响产量计划的完成。工人们曾经突破规定的数量，最多每炉装到四十八根，但这样需要提高炉温，延长钢锭在高温下停留的时间，容易脱炭。在辩论中有的主张少装，有的主张多装。车间领导方面根据炉内温度、加热时间和锻材规格，在杨玉佩小组进行了多次试验，找到了一切二的（即一根钢锭切做两根钢材）装二十根，一切四的装二十五根，一切五的装三十根的办法。既能作到装得多，产量高，又控制了钢锭在高温下的停留时间，一百公厘的钢材的脱炭层只有0.32公厘，比国家规定的1.35公厘还小，质量合格。这个新的操作方法便纳入了操作规程。
    在对职工提的意见进行现场试验和技术鉴定以后，锻造车间修改补充了原有的操作规程，增订了易脱炭钢加热规程。这样，操作规程就切合生产实际了。
