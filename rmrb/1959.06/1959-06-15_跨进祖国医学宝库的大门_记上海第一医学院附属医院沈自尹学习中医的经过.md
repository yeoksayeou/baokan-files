Stepping into the Treasure House of Traditional Chinese Medicine
A Record of Shen Ziyin's Journey of Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine at Shanghai First Medical College Affiliated Hospital
By Our Correspondent Li Qingfen

Like an Elementary School Student

In the spring of 1955, in the garden of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shanghai First Medical College, every morning, the tall and slender young internist Shen Ziyin was always reciting "Guan Zhi of Ancient Prose" aloud. Why would a doctor so diligently recite these ancient texts that seem unrelated to medicine? It turned out that he was trying to memorize more ancient vocabulary to make it easier for him to study the "Treatise on Cold Damage" in traditional Chinese medicine.

Not long before this, the hospital had established a traditional Chinese medicine outpatient department for the first time, inviting traditional Chinese medicine doctor Jiang Chunhua. Shen Ziyin, like everyone else, didn't pay much attention to traditional Chinese medicine, let alone think that he would have anything to do with Dr. Jiang. Soon, something happened. A patient suffering from severe liver cirrhosis with ascites and a patient suffering from uremia had been lying in the hospital ward for a month or two, and their conditions were very critical. The liver cirrhosis patient's abdominal circumference was severely swollen. The uremia patient was already in a coma. At the request of the families, Dr. Jiang came to the ward for a consultation. The conditions of these two patients improved greatly the day after taking the traditional Chinese medicine. The uremia patient had regained consciousness, and the ascites patient's ascites had begun to subside. The doctors told each other in surprise: "Traditional Chinese medicine and herbs are really good." But Shen Ziyin couldn't help but think: "How great it would be to master this set of traditional Chinese medicine as well." However, this thought only flashed through his mind. How to learn, whether he could learn it well, he hadn't seriously considered. After all, he hadn't seen a Western-trained doctor learning traditional Chinese medicine.

When the hospital leaders decided to let Shen Ziyin leave his post and follow Dr. Jiang Chunhua to learn traditional Chinese medicine, Shen Ziyin became worried. What he feared was that his medical knowledge was very limited. Not to mention that he didn't understand any basic knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine, even his knowledge of Western medicine was very shallow since he had only graduated from Shanghai First Medical College for two years. In case he didn't learn well, ending up being neither fish nor fowl, falling behind his peers in Western medicine, it would be a big loss. However, the Party organization encouraged him, saying, "This is a glorious task assigned to you by the Party. You are a member of the Communist Youth League and should take the lead in undertaking the responsibility of learning, inheriting, and promoting traditional Chinese medicine." At the same time, the examples of Dr. Jiang treating those two patients revolved in his mind: "In order to promote traditional Chinese medicine, in order to better relieve the suffering of patients, as long as there is determination, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome." He mustered his courage and accepted the instructions from the leadership. From then on, his life of diligently studying traditional Chinese medicine like an elementary school student began.

Breaking Through the First Barrier

Shen Ziyin took notes while listening to Dr. Jiang's lectures on "Treatise on Cold Damage" during the day. He also combined reference books and his own experiences to reorganize the notes, review them by himself at night, or write a new set of notes. In order to better understand the dialectical relationship of mutual contradiction and unity of Yin and Yang in traditional Chinese medicine, he also studied "On Contradiction."

When Shen Ziyin followed Dr. Jiang to examine traditional Chinese medicine wards or consultations, he often carefully examined the medical history, paid close attention to Dr. Jiang's diagnostic methods and the basis for prescribing medications, and tried to understand them in connection with the theories he had learned. Once, a hospitalized patient in the Western medicine dermatology ward suffered from bacillary dysentery. After being treated for some time, the bacteria were eliminated, but the patient still had diarrhea about twenty times a day. The Western medicine doctor asked Dr. Jiang for a consultation. Dr. Jiang prescribed a prescription that included tonifying herbs such as ginseng and aconite. After taking the medicine, the patient's bowel movements returned to normal the next day. It was really rare to use tonifying herbs to treat dysentery. Shen Ziyin immediately carefully studied the patient's medical history and Dr. Jiang's principles of diagnosis and medication. Although the patient had diarrhea, the tongue coating was not greasy, and the abdomen did not hurt, indicating that there was no pathogenic factor inside. The patient was thin, his complexion was sallow, and his pulse was slow and weak, indicating that the body was weak due to excessive diarrhea, and the weakness made it impossible to stop the diarrhea. Therefore, Dr. Jiang did not use the general methods of clearing heat and detoxification, but used tonifying herbs to support "righteous qi." In the face of such facts, Dr. Shen deeply felt that traditional Chinese medicine's understanding of diseases based on principles such as Yin and Yang and deficiency and excess was not mysterious, but reasonable. From then on, it strengthened his belief in learning traditional Chinese medicine.

Half a year later, Shen Ziyin finished studying "Treatise on Cold Damage" and basically mastered the theory of syndrome differentiation and treatment. "Once one section is clear, all sections are clear." After breaking through the first barrier, he only spent half a year to finish studying the other basic theoretical books of traditional Chinese medicine, such as Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Cabinet, Essentials of the Inner Canon, Binhu Pulse Diagnosis, Materia Medica, and so on.

Passing the Practical Test

Whether one can apply the theoretical knowledge they have learned is an important test of their academic performance. Shen Ziyin bravely and conscientiously endured the actual test in his internship and later in the actual treatment in the hospital.

During the six-month internship, Shen Ziyin groped to prescribe prescriptions for patients under the guidance of other traditional Chinese medicine doctors. However, at the beginning, he was more restrained, only slightly modifying the established formulas and dare not make greater changes.

After the internship, Shen Ziyin returned to the hospital and showed some of the prescriptions he had written to Dr. Jiang. After reading them, Dr. Jiang said, "You prescribe well, but not lively enough. It is not enough to just respect the established formulas. You must also be able to break free from the limitations of the established formulas, boldly create, and organize your own formulas."

Dr. Jiang's words gave Shen Ziyin a lot of inspiration. Once, there was a seventy-five-year-old patient with jaundice in the Western medicine ward who had not passed a single drop of urine for three consecutive days. Generally speaking, this can easily lead to the occurrence of uremia, and the situation is very serious. This symptom is rare in clinical practice, and there are no established formulas in the literature and ancient medical records. Shen Ziyin calmly examined the patient, inquired about the patient's family members, and considered all aspects of the patient's condition. He believed that "damp heat flowed downward into the bladder," causing the bladder's "qi transformation to be unfavorable," that is, kidney function was hindered. Although there were some methods of clearing damp heat from the bladder in ancient medical records, the patient had not had a bowel movement for a week. In addition, Shen Ziyin carefully considered these complex situations of whether to use purgative medicine for such an elderly patient and resolutely used betel nut with strong purging effect and some medicines that promote damp heat to form a prescription. Two hours after taking the medicine, the patient began to urinate, and the next day both bowel and urinary movements returned to normal.

This is how Shen Ziyin passed the practical test. In practice, he constantly studied "Materia Medica" and ancient medical records, mastered the properties of drugs, and learned how the predecessors prescribed prescriptions based on the patient's past, present, and possible future changes. He successfully treated intractable diseases such as ulcers, asthma, and chronic nephritis with his own organized prescriptions.

An Unshirkable Responsibility

When Shen Ziyin had only been studying "Treatise on Cold Damage" for five or six months, he discovered that his "master" Jiang Chunhua had a very high therapeutic effect in treating liver cirrhosis with ascites, and he did not use the method of simply "attacking" ascites like ordinary people. He spent several months studying the medical histories of ninety-four cases, analyzed their causes, conditions, and nutritional status according to traditional Chinese medicine theory and using modern scientific methods. From the stable therapeutic effects of these ninety-four cases, he summarized Dr. Jiang's treatment rules for liver cirrhosis with ascites: using "attack" for patients with strong bodies, using tonification for patients with weak bodies, or combining "attack" and "tonification." Shen Ziyin cherished his "master's" experience and felt that summarizing and disseminating them was his unshirkable responsibility. Therefore, he also promptly organized and wrote articles on Dr. Jiang's experience of treating dysentery with tonification methods and cooperating with Western medicine to cure a patient with massive hemorrhage due to typhoid fever. On New Year's Day this year, with the support and help of everyone, he studied ancient literature and more than forty clinical experiences of the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and wrote an article on the classification of chronic nephritis. Chronic nephritis has never been discussed separately in the medical books of traditional Chinese medicine. Instead, it is classified as edema because of its symptoms of edema, and is confused with other diseases. Shen Ziyin singled it out, classified it according to the actual case situation, and listed the treatment principles of each category, so that it can effectively guide the actual treatment work.

Now, Shen Ziyin is both an attending physician in Western medicine internal medicine and an attending physician in traditional Chinese medicine. In his treatment of each patient, the principles and methods of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine often exchange ideas.

Due to Shen Ziyin's diligent study and Dr. Jiang's serious teaching and remarkable curative effect, they both won gold medals from the Central Ministry of Health in February this year. Shen Ziyin felt that he had only just stepped into the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine, so he was determined to study more deeply and diligently. (Attached picture)

    跨进祖国医学宝库的大门
    记上海第一医学院附属医院沈自尹学习中医的经过
    本报记者　李晴氛
    像小学生一样
    1955年春天，在上海第一医学院附属第一医院的花园里，每天清晨，那个瘦长的内科青年医生沈自尹，总是捧着一本“古文观止”喃喃地背诵。一个医生，为什么这样认真地背诵这些与医学不相干的古文？原来他是为了多记熟些古语词汇，使自己学习中医“伤寒论”更方便一些。
    在这以前不久，医院里第一次增设了中医门诊部，请来了中医师姜春华。沈自尹和大家一样，对中医不大注意，更没有想到自己会和这位姜医生发生什么关系。不久，发生了一件事。一个患严重肝硬化腹水和一个患尿毒症病人，在医院病房里已经躺了一两个月，病况十分危急。肝硬化腹水病人腹围肿胀得很厉害。尿毒症患者已经昏迷不醒。应家属的请求，姜医生来到了病房会诊。这两位患者服用了中药的第二天，就有很大的好转，尿毒病人已清醒过来；腹水病人腹水已开始下降。医师们惊喜相告：“中医中药果然不错。”而沈自尹却不由得这样想：“要能把中医这一套也掌握住多好。”但是这种念头也不过一闪而过，怎么学，能不能学得好，他都没有认真考虑过。因为，他究竟还没有见到过一位学习中医的西医师。
    当医院领导决定让沈自尹离职跟姜春华医生学习中医时，沈自尹却顾虑起来。他怕的是自己医学知识很少，不要说中医基础知识一点不懂，就是西医的知识，由于自己从上海第一医学院毕业刚两年，也很浅薄，万一学不好，弄得中不中西不西，落在同辈西医后面，多不合算。但是，党组织鼓励他说：“这是党给你的光荣任务。你是青年团员，应该带头担当起学习继承发扬祖国医学的责任。”同时，姜医生治疗那两个病人的事例，在他脑子里盘旋着：“为了发扬祖国医学，为了更好地解除病人的痛苦，只要有决心，没有克服不了的困难。”他鼓起了勇气，接受了领导上的指示。从此，他像小学生一样，刻苦学习祖国医学的生活就开始了。
          劈开第一节
    沈自尹在白天听姜医生讲解“伤寒论”时做笔记，又结合看参考书和自己的体会，把笔记重新整理，晚上自修一遍，或者写出一份新的笔记。为了更好地理解中医学中阴阳互相矛盾而又统一的辩证关系，他还学习了“矛盾论”。
    沈自尹跟着姜医生查中医病房或会诊时，经常仔细查看病史，密切注意姜医生诊断的方法和用药的根据，努力联系自己学过的理论来理解。有一次，西医皮肤科病房里一位住院病人患了菌痢，治了一些时候，细菌是消灭了，但是病人仍旧一天拉肚子二十次左右，西医师请姜医生会诊，姜医生开了一剂包括有人参、附子等补药的药方，病人吃了后，第二天大便就恢复正常。用补药来治痢疾，这实在是少见的事。沈自尹立即仔细研究了这位患者的病史和姜医生的诊断、用药的原则，病人虽然腹泻，但舌苔不腻，肚子不疼，说明内无邪气，病人消瘦、面色憔悴、脉缓慢细弱，表示由于腹泻过多使得身体虚弱，而虚弱又使得腹泻无法止住，因此，姜医生不用一般清热解毒的办法，而是用补药扶“正气”。沈医生在这样的事实面前，深深感到中医以阴阳、虚实等原则来认识疾病，并不玄妙，而是有道理的。从此，更加强了他学习中医的信念。
    半年以后，沈自尹学完了“伤寒论”，基本上掌握了辨证论治的理论。“一节通，节节通”，劈开了第一节后，另外几本中医基本理论书籍，金匮要略、内经知要、濒湖脉诀、本草等等，只用了半年的时间就学完了。
          过实践关
    懂得了一些理论知识，是否能运用，这是对学习成绩的重要考验。沈自尹在实习中以及后来在医院里实际治疗时，都勇敢而又兢兢业业地承受了实际的考验。
    在半年的实习中，沈自尹在其他中医师的指导下，摸索着给病人开方。但是开始时，比较拘束，只是按照成方，稍有加减，不敢有更大的变动。
    实习完了，沈自尹回到医院，把自己开的一些方子拿给姜医生看，姜医生看了以后说：“你开的不错，但是不活泼。光尊重成方还不够，还要能不受成方的限制，大胆创造，自己组织方子。”
    姜医生的这番话，给沈自尹很大的启发。有一次，西医病房里有一个七十五岁的黄疸病人，一连三天膀胱里没有一滴尿，一般说来，这样很容易导致尿毒症的发生，情况很严重。这种症状在临床中很少见，在文献和古代医案中也没有成方可查。沈自尹沉着地诊察了病人，询问了病人的家属，考虑了病人的一切情况，认为是“湿热往下流注到膀胱”，引起膀胱“气化不利”，也就是说，肾脏功能受到阻碍。古代医案里虽然有一些清理膀胱湿热的攻泻方法，可是病人又有一星期大便不通的情况，另外，对这么大年纪的病人，敢不敢用攻泻药，沈自尹仔细地考虑了这些复杂情况，毅然用了清泻效强的槟榔和一些利湿热的药组成了方子。病人服药后两小时，就开始小便，第二天大小便都恢复了正常。
    沈自尹就是这样地度过了实践关。在实践中，他不断地学习“本草”和古代医案，掌握药物的性格，学习前辈如何根据病人的过去、当前和可能发生的变化来处方。他用自己组织的药方，成功地治疗溃疡、哮喘、慢性肾炎等疑难病症。
        义不容辞的责任
    沈自尹在学习“伤寒论”才有五、六个月的时候，发现他的“师傅”姜春华治疗肝硬化腹水疗效很高，而且不像一般人那样只用“攻”腹水的办法。他花了好几个月的时间，研究了九十四个病例的病史，根据中医理论，运用现代科学方法分析了他们的病因、病情和营养状况，从这九十四个病例稳定的疗效中，总结出姜医生对肝硬化腹水采取体强的病人用“攻”、体虚弱的病人用补，或“攻”“补”兼施的治疗规律。沈自尹珍惜“师傅”的经验，感到总结、传播它们是自己义不容辞的责任。因此，姜医生用补法治疗痢疾以及和西医合作治好一个伤寒大出血的病人的点滴经验，他也都及时进行了整理、写成文章。今年元旦，在大家的支持和帮助下，他研究了古代文献和中医科的四十多例临床经验，又写出了一篇关于慢性肾炎分类的文章。对慢性肾炎，祖国医学的医书中历来都没有单独谈论过它，而是以它有水肿的症状，归在水肿类，与其它疾病混淆在一起。沈自尹把它单独提出来，根据实际病例情况，作了分类，并列举了各类的治疗原则，这样就能有力地指导实际治疗工作。
    现在，沈自尹既是西医内科主治医生，又是中医科主治医生，在他对每一个病人的治疗中，中医、西医的原理和方法，常常交流起来。
    沈自尹由于刻苦学习，姜医生由于教学认真和疗效显著，在今年2月，同时获得中央卫生部的金质奖章。沈自尹感到自己只是刚跨进祖国医学宝库的大门，因此他决心更深入更刻苦地学习下去。（附图片）
