　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 24th - Cuban Prime Minister Castro announced in Camagüey City on the 23rd that the government has decided to place large estates in Camagüey Province with more than one hundred caballerías of land under control in order to carry out land reform.

　　Recently, large cattle ranchers in this province, in order to sabotage land reform, have refused to supply meat to the market in order to create chaos. The large estate owners and cattle ranchers have even threatened to go to the mountains and fight land reform to the end.

　　Faced with the resistance of the large estate owners, Prime Minister Castro is currently inspecting the implementation of the land reform law in the country. On the afternoon of the 23rd, he inspected several estates in the Bayamo area of ​​Oriente Province. Because the resistance of the estate owners there was particularly rampant, he immediately ordered troops to occupy these estates.

　　At the same time, hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers across the country are automatically organizing to defend land reform. On the 21st, hundreds of farmers in the Guane area, after learning of the large estate owners' conspiracy to rebel, immediately entered Guane City with door bolts, sticks, and stones to hold a demonstration. Their actions timely prevented the realization of the rebellion conspiracy. Similar spontaneous actions by the people to defend land reform and defend the revolution are appearing all over the country. Not long ago, representatives of twenty-nine trade unions in Las Villas Province passed a resolution requesting the organization of workers' own armed militias. Textile workers in this province also donated 160,000 pesos to support land reform.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 25th - The Cuban government today confiscated 23,224 caballerías of land in Camagüey Province belonging to American monopoly capital's sugar companies and large cattle ranches.

　　The American industrial companies whose land was confiscated this time include: Gulf-Atlantic Sugar Company, Adelaida Sugar Company, Francisco Sugar Mill, Baragua Sugar Mill, Manati Sugar Mill, Zonuagua and Haronu Sugar Mill, and King Ranch. King Ranch is an American livestock monopoly organization in Cuba and also the largest livestock estate in Camagüey Province, occupying a large area of ​​land in the province from Nuevitas City in the north to the coast of Guayabal in the south. This ranch was established in April 1958 after Batista's troops drove 250 farmers from this large area of ​​land. The Cuban Revolutionary Army, on Castro's orders, moved into the confiscated estates in order to crush the conspiracy of the province's large cattle ranchers to disrupt meat supplies and raise meat prices, thereby obstructing land reform.

    古巴农民奋起保卫土改
    政府征收美国垄断组织的大庄园的土地
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗23日在卡马圭城宣布，政府决定把卡马圭省拥有土地一百卡瓦耶里亚以上的大庄园置于管制之下，以便土地改革的进行。
    最近，这个省的大畜牧主为了破坏土地改革，竟拒绝向市场供应肉食，以便制造混乱。大庄园主和大畜牧主甚至还扬言要上山同土地改革斗争到底。
    面对大庄园主们的反抗，卡斯特罗总理目前正在国内视察土地改革法的执行情况。23日下午，他视察了奥连特省巴雅摩地方的几个庄园。由于那里的庄园主的反抗异常猖狂，他当即下令派军队占领这些庄园。
    与此同时，全国成千上万的农民和工人正在自动组织起来，保卫土地改革。在21日，瓜内地方的数百名农民在得悉大庄园主的叛乱阴谋后，马上手执门栓、棍子和石块，进入瓜内城举行示威。他们的行动及时地阻止了叛乱阴谋的实现。诸如此类的人民群众保卫土地改革和保卫革命的自发行动都在全国各地出现。不久以前，拉斯维利亚斯省二十九个工会的代表曾通过一个决议，要求组织工人自己的武装民兵。这个省的纺织工人还捐献了十六万比索支持土地改革。
    新华社哈瓦那25日电　古巴政府今天征收了卡马圭省属于美国垄断资本的糖业公司和牧畜业大庄园的二万三千二百二十四卡瓦耶里亚土地。
    这次被征收土地的美国产业公司包括：海湾—大西洋糖业公司、阿德拉伊达糖公司、弗兰西斯科糖厂、巴拉瓜糖厂、马纳蒂糖厂、左纳瓜和哈罗努糖厂，以及金氏牧场。金氏牧场是美国在古巴的牧畜业垄断组织，也是卡马圭省最大的牧畜业庄园，占有该省北自努埃维塔斯城，南至瓜亚巴耳海岸之间的大片土地。这个牧场是在1958年4月间依靠巴蒂斯塔军队把二百五十个农民从这一大片土地上赶走之后才建立起来的。古巴革命军奉卡斯特罗之命驻进了被征收土地的庄园，以便粉碎该省大牧畜业主破坏肉类供应、抬高肉价，借以阻挠土改的阴谋。
