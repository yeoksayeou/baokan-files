Tianjin Power Machine Factory Takes Measures to Strengthen Weak Links
Organizes Balanced Production to Ensure Complete Products

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 16th dispatch) Tianjin Power Machine Factory adjusted the imbalance in the production of components and parts, organized complete production, accelerated the factory delivery time of finished products, and reduced capital backlog.

The eighty and one hundred twenty horsepower diesel engines and air compressors produced by the Tianjin Power Machine Factory are urgently needed power equipment for current mining, railway, and other constructions. However, the production of parts and components in this factory is extremely unbalanced. Some are produced in large quantities and are increasing, while others are produced in small quantities and are decreasing. As a result, since the beginning of this year, the production situation has been abnormal, and the number of finished products leaving the factory has decreased month by month. Taking the eighty-horsepower diesel engine as an example, among its more than one thousand types of parts, as of May, the factory's inventory or work-in-progress parts were sufficient to assemble three to five thousand units, which could not be completed even in the first quarter of next year; while some key parts were so few that there was not even a single blank. As a result, many products could not be assembled on time, delivered as complete sets, and seriously backloged the factory's working capital.

The formation of this problem, according to analysis, has the following subjective and objective reasons: The factory's foundry workshop and the second machine shop responsible for large parts processing have always been weak links. The various temporary tasks since the beginning of this year have frequently impacted these two workshops, making the difference in the output of various parts increasingly large. Secondly, some parts are frequently reworked or scrapped. Third, because some raw materials are lacking or of poor quality, coupled with the factory's lack of control, whatever materials come in, they are used to do whatever work, thus making this contradiction even more prominent.

After the factory's Party Committee discovered this serious problem, it successively convened Party Committee meetings and expanded Party Committee meetings to carry out ideological work from top to bottom and from inside to outside, unified understanding, and the Party Committee decided that it would rather affect some output value than reverse this situation and accelerate the delivery of finished products. Therefore, it put forward the production direction of "cut long lines, make up short lines" to all employees. Immediately following, from leaders to workers, they took comprehensive action. First of all, in terms of planning management, the production of excessive parts was stopped, and the labor organization was adjusted, and experienced veteran technical workers were transferred to support the production of "insufficient" parts. The equipment capacity of the foundry and the second machine shop was insufficient, so leading cadres, technicians, and workers adopted a three-in-one method to design and rush to manufacture some simple equipment; at the same time, a large-scale collaboration was widely carried out throughout the factory, mobilizing the workers in hot processing, machine repair, assembly, and other workshops to squeeze out their equipment to support the weak links. In terms of leadership, organizing complete production and improving product quality were also listed as the most important tasks.

Since the beginning of June, all the factory's employees have been actively taking action with full confidence around these two most important tasks. The workers in the foundry workshop, in response to the abnormal phenomenon of poor casting quality and high scrap rate, made great efforts in technical innovation. The effect of the cupola furnace eating earth iron was not good, so it was rebuilt into a hot blast furnace; and the lining of the cupola furnace was changed from acidic to neutral, with an additional water jacket, to improve desulfurization capacity. The factory's technicians also closely followed the pace of the workers. Technicians from the technology section and design section are analyzing, reviewing, and improving processes and drawings with the workers to ensure product quality. Technicians from the technology section, production section, and inspection section are also analyzing and studying the factory's substitute materials, so that the factory can produce excellent products and reasonably use various raw materials.

Since June 1, Tianjin Power Machine Factory has implemented balanced production measures and has already received preliminary results. As of June 10, key parts for fifty sets of diesel engines have been put into production; and complete sets of parts for nineteen eighty-horsepower diesel engines have entered the assembly workshop. In June, the factory will be able to produce ninety-six eighty-horsepower diesel engines and twenty air compressors and eight one hundred twenty-horsepower diesel engines to support the construction of mines and railways.

    天津动力机厂采取措施加强薄弱环节
    组织均衡生产保证产品成套
    本报天津16日电　天津动力机厂调整部件、零件生产不均衡的状况，组织成套生产，加速了成品出厂时间，减少了资金积压。
    天津动力机厂生产的八十和一百二十马力的柴油机和空气压缩机等产品，是当前矿山、铁路等建设中迫切需要的动力设备。但是，这个厂的零件部件的生产极不均衡，有的生产得多，而且越来越多，有的生产得少，而且越来越少。因而今年以来，生产情况不正常，出厂的成品，一月比一月少。以八十马力的柴油机为例，在它的一千多种零件中，到5月份，工厂库存或在制中的零件，有些足够装配三、五千台，到明年第一季度都装配不完；而有些关键性的零件，少到连一件毛坯也没有。结果，许多产品不能按时装配，成套出厂、严重积压了工厂的流动资金。
    这个问题的形成，据分析，有如下的主观和客观的原因：工厂的铸工车间和负责大件加工的第二机工车间，历来就是薄弱环节，今年以来的各种临时任务，又经常冲击这两个车间，就使各种零件产量的差别，越来越大。其次，有些零件，经常返工或报废。第三，因为有些原材料欠缺，或质量较差，加上工厂不加控制，来什么料，就作什么活，因而使这个矛盾更加突出。
    工厂党委会发现了这个严重问题以后，就连续召开党委会和党委扩大会，从上到下，从内到外，进行思想工作，统一了认识，党委决定宁可影响些产值，也要扭转这个局面，加速成品出厂。因此便向全体职工提出了“卡长线，补短线”的生产方向。紧跟着，从领导到工人就全面行动起来。首先从计划管理上停止了过多的零件的生产，调整了劳动组织，把有经验的老技术工人抽调出来，支援“不足的”零件的生产。铸工和第二机工车间的设备能力不足，领导干部、技术人员、工人就采取三结合的方法，设计赶制一些简易设备；同时广泛地开展全厂范围内的大协作，发动热加工、机修、装配等车间的职工挤出自己的设备支援薄弱环节。在领导方面，也把组织成套性生产和提高产品质量列为头等重要的任务。
    从6月开始，全厂职工围绕着这两项头等重要的任务，信心百倍地积极行动起来。铸工车间的职工，针对铸件质量不好和报废率高的不正常现象，大闹技术革新。冲天炉吃土铁的效果不好，就改建热风炉；并且把冲天炉的炉衬由酸性改为中性，外加水套，以提高去硫能力。全厂的技术人员也紧紧地跟上了工人的步伐。工艺科、设计科的技术人员正和工人在一起分析、审查改进工艺和图纸，以保证产品质量。技术科、生产科、检验科的技术人员也对全厂的代用材料进行分析研究，使工厂既能生产优良的产品，又能合理使用各种原材料。
    天津动力机厂自6月1日开始，执行均衡生产的措施以来，已经收到了初步效果。截止6月10日止，已有五十台、套柴油机的关键零件投入了生产；有十九台八十马力柴油机的全套零件进入了装配车间。6月份，全厂将能有九十六台八十马力的柴油机和二十台空气压缩机及八台一百二十马力的柴油机出厂，支援矿山和铁路的建设。
