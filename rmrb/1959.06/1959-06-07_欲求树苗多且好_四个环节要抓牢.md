To complete the afforestation task faster and better, we must launch a mass seedling cultivation campaign to overcome the bottleneck of insufficient seedlings. On the one hand, the province's seedling cultivation area should be expanded from last year's 360,000 mu to 500,000 mu. On the other hand, we must do everything possible to strive for high seedling yields, requiring the total seedling output to leap from last year's 4 billion seedlings to 20 billion seedlings.

Based on our experience, to do a good job in mass seedling cultivation, we must firmly grasp four key links:

One, establish and improve forestry professional teams, and assign responsibility to these teams for managing seedling cultivation work. Last year, some areas had very large seedling cultivation areas, but the seedling output was very low. The reason for this was mainly that there was no dedicated person responsible for management. Everyone was in charge, but no one was really in charge; they managed it when they thought of it, and forgot about it when they didn't. Conversely, wherever there was dedicated leadership and a fixed labor force in the nurseries, the seedling yield and quality were very high. For example, the Qinshui Chengguan Commune has a professional team for seedling cultivation, and they have continuously achieved bumper seedling harvests.

Two, make comprehensive arrangements for seedling cultivation work. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, various rural productions are very tense. If arrangements are not made well, seedling cultivation work is in danger of being squeezed out. Each commune should formulate realistic seedling cultivation plans according to the local needs for landscaping, and distribute them to the management districts, in order to select better nursery lands and ensure sufficient supply of seeds, fertilizers, and labor.

Three, implement the principle of combining large-scale nurseries with small-scale nurseries. People's communes and various management districts and production teams should establish larger, fixed nurseries to concentrate seedling cultivation appropriately. Our slogan is "Each commune cultivates a thousand mu of seedlings, with an output of fifty thousand per mu." This facilitates the establishment of professional organizations and also allows for the planned cultivation of various varieties and specifications of seedlings. However, while advocating the establishment of large-scale nurseries, we must not neglect the establishment of small-scale nurseries, mobilizing commune members to cultivate seedlings using courtyards, flower beds, and flower pots, and mobilizing institutions, schools, factories, mines, and troops to run nurseries. Xia County, a model county for roadside afforestation, overcame the difficulty of seedlings by implementing this principle. Lin County advocated flower bed and flower pot seedling cultivation last year, and achieved great results. The Nuanquan meeting of 101 households in this county produced more than 26,000 seedlings just from flower bed seedling cultivation. The First Middle School used the open space on campus for seedling cultivation, and the output reached more than 800,000 seedlings. Because various institutions, schools, and farmers in this county universally used courtyards, flower beds, and flower pots for seedling cultivation, and communes and teams established fixed nurseries, the situation of insufficient seedlings began to change. This fact shows that flower bed and flower pot seedling cultivation saves labor and does not occupy cultivated land, and is a fast, good, and economical seedling cultivation method.

Four, firmly grasp the collection of early-maturing seeds such as poplar, willow, and elm. Without a mass seed collection campaign, the seedling cultivation campaign cannot be launched. Currently, poplar, willow, and elm seeds are already mature, and we must seize the opportunity to organize the masses to collect them vigorously to ensure sowing needs.

    欲求树苗多且好　四个环节要抓牢
    山西省农业建设厅林业局
    为了更快更好地完成造林任务，必须开展群众性的育苗运动，突破苗木不足这一关。一方面，要把全省的育苗面积从去年的三十六万亩扩大到五十万亩。另方面要千方百计地争取苗木丰产，要求苗木总产量在去年四十亿株的基础上，跃进到二百亿株。
    根据我们的经验，要想搞好群众性的育苗工作，必须紧紧地抓住四个环节：
    一、建立和健全林业专业队，责成专业队管理育苗工作。去年有些地区育苗面积虽然很大，但苗木产量很低，究其原因，主要是没有专人负责管理，大家都管，大家都不管，想起来管，想不起来就算。相反，凡是有专人领导并有固定劳力的苗圃，苗木产量和质量都很高。像沁水城关公社育苗有专业队，他们就连续获得了苗木大丰产。
    二、做好育苗工作的全面安排。在大跃进的形势下，农村的各项生产十分紧张，如果安排不好，育苗工作就有被挤掉的危险。各个公社都应根据当地园林化的需要，制定切合实际的育苗计划，并下达到各管理区，以便选留较好的苗圃地，保证树籽、肥料、劳力等充分供应。
    三、执行大型苗圃和小型苗圃相结合的方针。人民公社和各个管理区、生产队都要建立较大的固定苗圃适当集中育苗，我们的口号是
  “每社育苗千亩，每亩产量五万”。这样既便于设置专业组织，也能有计划地培育多种品种、多种规格的苗木。但在提倡建立大型苗圃的同时，也不能忽视设置小型苗圃，发动社员利用庭院空地、花畦、花盆育苗，发动机关、学校、厂矿、部队办苗圃。四旁绿化模范县夏县，就是执行这条方针，克服了种苗困难的。临县去年提倡花畦、花盆育苗，成绩也很大，这县一百零一户的暖泉会，只花畦育苗一项就产苗木两万六千多株；第一中学利用校内空地育苗，产苗量达到八十万余株。由于这个县的各机关、学校、农户普遍利用庭院空地、花畦、花盆育苗和社社队队兴办固定苗圃，开始改变了苗木不足的局面。这个事实说明，花畦花盆育苗节省劳力，不占用耕地，是一种多快好的育苗方法。
    四、紧紧的抓住杨、柳、榆等早熟种籽的采集工作。没有一个群众性的采种运动，育苗运动就无法开展。目前杨、柳、榆树种籽已经成熟，必须抓紧时机，组织群众大力采集，保证播种需要。
