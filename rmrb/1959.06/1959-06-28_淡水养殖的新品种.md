New Varieties for Freshwater Aquaculture
    Shen Ronglie

Our rivers, lakes, and marshes, studded across the land like stars, contain abundant aquatic resources, providing us with many varieties suitable for aquaculture. In addition to the familiar black carp, grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, common carp, crucian carp, bream, and the subtropical mud carp suitable for aquaculture in South China, as well as salmon and trout suitable for aquaculture in the Northeast, the number of freshwater fish species farmed in China has steadily increased in recent years. Tilapia, snakehead, Chinese perch, Erythroculter ilishaeformis, mandarin fish, yellow eel, loach, and others have been successfully trial-cultured, and many regions have put them into production. In some areas, freshwater aquaculture has even expanded from fish to reptiles like turtles and soft-shelled turtles, amphibians like frogs and giant salamanders, and crustaceans like shrimp and crabs.

These situations demonstrate that "taking materials locally and breeding locally" is entirely possible in the freshwater aquaculture industry. These situations also show that transforming wild species into domestic species can fully develop and utilize all available aquaculture areas, producing more nutritious, affordable, and high-quality aquatic products for the people. Here, we introduce several new freshwater aquaculture species to our readers.

I. Snakehead: Commonly known as black fish, spotted fish, or cai fish. It is a wild bottom-dwelling freshwater fish widely distributed in lakes and ponds. It has accessory respiratory organs that aid gill respiration, strong drought resistance, and high survival rates for fry during transportation and rearing, making it suitable for individual rearing in generally abandoned small ponds. Snakehead grow and reproduce quickly. In Yujiatun, Qujing County, Yunnan Province, ten small black fish were released into a pond, and after three years, they had reproduced to more than 10,000. It is very popular in domestic and international markets and is a freshwater fish with great development potential.

II. Tilapia: A good fish species gifted to our country by Vietnam, suitable for pond and lake aquaculture in tropical and subtropical regions. A single parent fish can reproduce several times a year. The fry begin to lay eggs four months after hatching. This fish has a wide range of food sources, strong resistance, and can withstand long-distance transportation. Rapid growth is its defining characteristic. Fry with a body length of five to six centimeters can generally grow to fifteen centimeters after more than fifty days of rearing. Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and other places are now breeding and rearing it on a large scale.

III. Mullet: A major fish species farmed in coastal shallow seas. Mullet can be raised in freshwater alone or mixed with black carp, grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, and others. This fish has been stocked in the Guanting Reservoir and ditches in the suburbs of Shanghai.

IV. Soft-shelled turtle: Commonly known as turtle or yuan turtle. Soft-shelled turtles are adaptable, grow quickly, and are easy to raise. Soft-shelled turtles are nutritious and can be used not only for food but also as raw materials for medicine and handicrafts. Soft-shelled turtles are also an export commodity. Exporting one ton of soft-shelled turtles can be exchanged for one ton of steel. Baxian County and Renqiu, Hebei Province, and other places all raise them. Soft-shelled turtles are accustomed to resting and laying eggs on land. Ponds for raising soft-shelled turtles generally have a large slope and are surrounded by bamboo mats. Select parent turtles weighing two to three catties (soft-shelled turtles with reproductive capacity) and place them in the pond, feeding them snails, small miscellaneous fish, melon rinds, zucchini, and other feed. Generally, after more than two months of feeding (water temperature around 20 degrees Celsius), they can lay eggs, hatch, and reproduce naturally.

    淡水养殖的新品种
    沈荣埒
    星罗棋布的江河湖沼，蕴藏着的丰富水产资源，给我们提供了许多可资养殖的品种。我国目前淡水养殖的鱼类，除了千百年来人们熟悉的青鱼、草鱼、鲢鱼、鳙鱼、鲤鱼、鲫鱼、鳊鱼和适于华南养殖的亚热带鲮鱼以及适于东北地区养殖的鲑、鳟等鱼外，近年来续有增加。非洲鲫鱼、乌鳢、鲥鱼、鳜、鮊、黄鳝、泥鳅等都试养成功，许多地区并投入生产。有些地区的淡水养殖，还从鱼类扩展到了爬行类的龟、鳖，两栖类的蛙、娃娃鱼，甲壳类的虾、蟹等。
    这些情况说明，在淡水养殖事业中，“就地取材，就地育养”是完全可能的。这些情况也说明，化野生为家养，就能充分开拓利用一切可以养殖的水面，为人们生产更多的营养丰富、价廉物美的水产品。这里，我们向读者介绍几个淡水养殖新品种。
    一、乌鳢：俗名黑鱼、斑鱼、才鱼。是湖泊、池沼分布极广的野生底栖淡水鱼。它有帮助鳃呼吸的副呼吸器官，耐旱力强，苗种的运输饲养成活率高，适于就地利用一般荒废的小池沼单独饲养。乌鳢成长繁殖很快。云南曲靖县余家屯有一口塘放了十条小黑鱼，三年后就繁殖了一万多尾。它在国内外市场上很受欢迎，是一种很有发展前途的淡水鱼。
    二、非洲鲫鱼：是越南赠给我国的优良鱼种，适宜在热带和亚热带的池塘、湖沼养殖。一尾亲鱼每年可生殖几次。孵化后的幼苗四个月就开始产卵。这种鱼食料广，抵抗力强，耐长途运输。成长迅速，更是它的特点，体长五——六公分的幼鱼，经过五十多天的饲养，一般可以长到十五公分。广东、广西、福建等地现已大量繁殖饲养。
    三、鲻、梭鱼：是沿海浅海港养的主要鱼类。鲻、梭鱼能在淡水里单养或是和青鱼、草鱼、鲢鱼、鳙鱼等混养。官厅水库，上海郊区的沟渠里都放养有这种鱼。
    四、甲鱼：俗称鳖元鱼。甲鱼适应性强，成长快，容易饲养。甲鱼营养丰富，除了可供食用外，还是医药、工艺上的原料。甲鱼也是一种输出物资。出口一吨甲鱼，可换回一吨钢材。河北省霸县、任丘等地都有饲养。甲鱼习惯在岸上栖息产卵，养甲鱼的池一般坡度较大，围以竹箔。捕选体重二、三斤的亲鳖（有繁殖能力的甲鱼）放入池里，投给螺蛳、小杂鱼、瓜皮、西葫芦等饵料，一般经二个多月的饲养（水温在摄氏二十度左右），就能产卵孵化天然繁殖。
