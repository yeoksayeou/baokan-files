Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: More than a thousand worker representatives in the capital held a grand rally tonight, resolutely supporting the struggle of German workers and people for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

    The conference pointed out that the resolution of the German question brooks no delay. Western countries and the West German authorities must seriously consider the various proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. A peace treaty with Germany must be signed, the German question must be resolved peacefully, and the occupation regime in West Berlin must be abolished. The ongoing Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference should make a positive contribution to this end.
    The conference also expressed its full support for the efforts made by the European Trade Union and People's Conference for a Peace Treaty with Germany, Disarmament, and Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, held in Görlitz on the Oder-Neisse River from May 8th to 10th, at the initiative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to demand a peaceful resolution of the German question and to safeguard European security and world peace.
    Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended the conference. Wang Danner, Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, was invited to attend.
    Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the opening speech. He said: The German question has always been the source of tension in postwar Europe and is an important issue in the current struggle to defend world peace. The Second World War ended fourteen years ago, but a peace treaty with Germany has not yet been concluded.
    In his speech, he pointed out that the Soviet Union had put forward many proposals on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, but they were all unreasonably rejected by Western countries. The German Democratic Republic has always made unremitting efforts to establish a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany, and has put forward proposals for the establishment of a "confederation" and the signing of a non-aggression treaty. The West German authorities, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, have stubbornly rejected these proposals. Wang Jiong concluded by saying that the workers of the capital, together with the workers of all of China, resolutely support the just struggle of the fraternal German people and the working class. We believe that victory will surely belong to the German people.
    Xi Zhanyuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, then spoke. He said: The Chinese working class has always believed that peace is indivisible. We are not only concerned about establishing lasting peace in Asia, but also hope that peace in Europe will be guaranteed. In his speech, he emphasized that the resolution of the German question cannot be delayed any longer. If Western countries and the West German authorities stubbornly persist in their bankrupt Cold War policy at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, and continue to unreasonably play the "package deal" while rejecting the proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, they will only expose their true colors of delaying and obstructing the peaceful resolution of the German question more thoroughly. They will be further severely condemned by all peace-loving people in the world, and must bear full responsibility for undermining the resolution of the German question.
    Xi Zhanyuan said: We, the workers of the capital and the workers of the whole country, resolutely support the struggle of German workers for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. We will always stand with the workers and people of the German Democratic Republic, and will always be their backing in opposing imperialism and striving for national reunification. In his speech, Xi Zhanyuan also conveyed to the conference the situation of the European Trade Union and People's Conference for a Peace Treaty with Germany, Disarmament, and Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, recently held in Görlitz on the Oder-Neisse River. The Chinese trade union delegation participated in the conference as an observer.
    In his speech at the meeting, Ambassador Wang Danner introduced the struggle of the entire people of the German Democratic Republic. He said that no threats or inducements could make us give up the struggle to defend peace and our demands. We feel that we are strong because we represent the vital interests of the German people and the peace-loving people of all countries. We feel that we are strong because we have the full support of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving forces in the world.
    In his speech, he thanked the Chinese workers and trade unions for supporting the just struggle of the German people for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and he shouted: Long live the unity of the working classes of Germany and China! Long live the unity of the workers of the world!
    Geng Zhenying and Zhang Meilan, representatives of the workers of the capital, spoke at the conference. They expressed their full support for the struggle of the German worker brothers and people to establish a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany.
    All the worker representatives at the meeting responded to the speeches with warm applause, expressing their strong determination to fully support the just struggle of the German people.
    The conference finally unanimously adopted a telegram of support to the Free German Trade Union Federation (see page four).

    首都一千多工人代表举行大会
    支持德国人民争取缔结和约
    指出西方国家和西德必须认真对待苏联和德意志民主共和国建议
    新华社9日讯　首都一千多名工人代表今晚举行盛大集会，坚决支持德国工人和人民争取缔结对德和约的斗争。
    大会指出：德国问题的解决不容拖延，西方国家和西德当局必须认真对待苏联和德意志民主共和国的各项建议，对德和约必须签订，德国问题必须和平解决，西柏林占领制度必须废除，正在进行的日内瓦外长会议对此应该作出积极贡献。
    这次大会还表示全力支持根据世界工联的倡议，于5月8日到10日在奥德—尼斯河畔格利茨城举行的欧洲工会和人民争取缔结对德和约、裁军及禁止原子武器会议为要求和平解决德国问题、维护欧洲安全和世界和平所作的努力。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜出席了大会。应邀出席的还有德意志民主共和国驻我国大使汪戴尔。
    北京市工会联合会主席王炯致开会词。他说：德国问题，一直是战后欧洲紧张局势的根源，是当前保卫世界和平斗争中的一个重要问题。第二次世界大战已经结束十四年了，可是对德和约还没有缔结。
    他在讲话中指出，苏联曾就缔结对德和约问题提出很多建议，都遭到西方国家的无理拒绝。德意志民主共和国始终为建立一个统一、民主与和平的德国进行了不懈的努力，提出了成立“邦联”以及签订互不侵犯条约的建议，西德当局在美帝国主义的指使下，一直顽固地拒绝这些建议。王炯最后说，首都工人和全中国工人一道，坚决支持兄弟的德国人民和工人阶级的正义斗争，我们相信：胜利一定是属于德国人民的。
    中华全国总工会书记处书记郗占元接着讲话。他说：中国工人阶级一向认为：和平是不可分割的，我们不仅关心在亚洲建立持久和平，而且也希望欧洲的和平得到保障。他在讲话中着重指出：德国问题的解决已不容再拖了，如果西方国家和西德当局仍顽固地在日内瓦外长会议上坚持其早已破产的冷战政策，继续无理地玩弄“一揽子计划”而拒绝苏联和德意志民主共和国的建议，只能更彻底地暴露出他们拖延和阻挠和平解决德国问题的真面目，他们必将进一步遭到全世界一切爱好和平的人民的严厉谴责，并且必须对破坏德国问题的解决负全部责任。
    郗占元说：我们首都工人和全国工人坚决支持德国工人争取缔结对德和约的斗争。我们永远和德意志民主共和国工人和人民站在一起，并且永远是他们反对帝国主义和争取祖国统一的后盾。郗占元在讲话中，还向大会传达了最近在奥德—尼斯河畔格利茨城举行的欧洲工会和人民争取缔结对德和约、裁军及禁止原子武器会议的情况。中国工会代表团是以观察员资格参加了这次会议。
    汪戴尔大使在会上的讲话中介绍了德意志民主共和国全体人民的斗争情况，他说，任何威胁和利诱都不能使我们放弃保卫和平的斗争和要求。我们感到我们是强大的，因为我们代表着德国人民以及爱好和平的各国人民的切身利益。我们感到我们是强大的，因为我们得到以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营和世界上所有爱好和平力量的全力支持。
    他在讲话中感谢中国工人和工会支持德国人民争取缔结对德和约的正义斗争，他并且高呼：德中两国工人阶级的团结万岁！全世界工人的团结万岁！
    首都工人代表耿振英和张梅兰在大会上讲话。他们表示全力支持德国工人兄弟和人民争取建立一个统一、和平和民主的德国的斗争。
    全场工人代表对会上的讲话，都报以热烈的掌声，表示全力支持德国人民正义斗争的巨大决心。
    大会最后一致通过给自由德国工会联合会的支援电（见四版）。
