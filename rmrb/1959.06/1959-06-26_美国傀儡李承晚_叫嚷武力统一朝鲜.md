Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th: Seoul dispatch: Just as the people of the world are demanding a peaceful resolution to the Korean question, the American puppet Syngman Rhee on the 24th once again clamored: "Nothing but force can unify Korea."

In a written statement to a Seoul-based reporter for the American United Press International, Syngman Rhee also stated that it is absolutely impossible to resolve the unification of Korea through negotiations.

In his statement, Syngman Rhee vigorously incited the "allied nations" that had been battered and bloodied in the Korean War to once again engage in "common struggle." He said that he would need "material assistance" to take "action" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    美国傀儡李承晚
    叫嚷武力统一朝鲜
    新华社平壤25日电　汉城消息：正当世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的时候，美国的傀儡李承晚24日又在叫嚷：“除了武力以外，什么都不能统一朝鲜”。
    李承晚在他向美国合众国际社驻汉城记者发表的书面谈话中还表示，绝不可能通过谈判解决统一朝鲜的问题。
    李承晚在声明中极力鼓动在侵朝战争中碰得头破血流的“盟国”再次来进行“共同的斗争”。他说，他将需要“物质援助”来对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国采取“行动”。
