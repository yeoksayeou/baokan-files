    The Soviet Broad Masses of Working People
    Eagerly Study the New Edition of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"

    (Our dispatch) According to a report in the Soviet "Pravda," the new edition of the textbook "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" has aroused widespread attention among the Soviet working people. Soviet workers, farmers, intellectuals, and students are reading this new book with great enthusiasm. They are most interested in: the struggles made by the Soviet Union in the Great Patriotic War to achieve victory and in the post-war period to restore and rapidly improve the national economy, the historic resolutions of the 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU, and the implementation of these resolutions, etc. Because this historical stage has never been introduced in the previously published books on the history of the CPSU. In order to meet the needs of the broad readership, the Soviet Union has decided to increase the number of copies printed of this textbook.

    苏联广大劳动人民
    争读新版“苏共党史”
    本报讯　据苏联“真理报”报道：新版“苏联共产党历史”教科书出版后，在苏联劳动人民中间引起了广泛的注意。苏联的工人、农民、知识分子和学生，正以极大的热情阅读这本新书。他们最感兴趣的是：关于苏联在伟大卫国战争中为取得胜利和战后为恢复和迅速提高国民经济所作的斗争，关于苏共第二十次和第二十一次代表大会的历史性决议和这些决议的实现等章。因为这个历史阶段在过去出版的有关苏共历史书籍中从来没有介绍过。为了满足广大读者的需要，苏联决定增加这本教科书的印刷册数。
