(Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th dispatch) Nanjing Yuejin Steel Plant workers recently implemented three technical innovations in small blast furnaces using local methods – mechanical tap hole opening, tap hole closing, and round kiln sintering of ore. These innovations have been widely welcomed by employees of small blast furnace iron smelting units throughout the city.

The Yuejin Steel Plant was developed from a group of indigenous blast furnaces during the Great Leap Forward in steel production last year. It currently has four 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces. In the past six months, the plant has established a series of management systems, enabling the output and quality of pig iron to steadily rise. Recently, the plant's workers continued to actively carry out technical innovations to ensure safe production and reduce labor intensity, achieving significant results.

Traditionally, the opening and closing of tap holes in small blast furnaces has been done manually. In the past, when furnace workers opened the tap hole, one person had to lean against the furnace wall to hold the iron drill, while another person hit it with a sledgehammer from behind. This operation took a long time (about 20 to 30 minutes), involved high labor intensity, and could cause accidents if the sledgehammer missed. When closing the tap hole, workers had to face the flames shooting out of the furnace opening and quickly push the mud gun into the tap hole with an iron drill. Because the temperature in front of the furnace was very high, slow movements could result in burns or damaged clothing. Now, they have trial-produced a tap hole opening machine. During operation, they only need to start the motor, and the machine drill can open the tap hole in a few minutes, not only reducing labor intensity but also significantly improving work efficiency. When using the tap hole closing machine, workers only need to stand away from the flames, release the rope holding the mud gun, and accurately close the tap hole. Because there is no need to operate close to the flames, the safety of the workers is also guaranteed.

The round kiln for sintering ore is an improvement made by the plant's workers on the basis of using square kilns for sintering. Using square kilns for sintering, each kiln took nearly a day and a half to burn, and each firing required lighting the fire again, resulting in high fuel consumption for ignition. At the same time, because the area of the square kiln was large, it was difficult to control the "heat," and the sintered ore was either not thoroughly sintered or over-sintered, resulting in low quality. Now, using round kilns for sintering, they only need to light the fire once when starting the furnace, and then they can continuously add raw materials and a small amount of coke fines. A batch of sintered ore can be produced every two and a half hours. According to statistics, using this kiln for sintering can save 6,000 kilograms of reeds and 20 tons of coke fines per kiln per month, and the qualified rate of sintered ore is over 90%. Because loading the kiln is simple, each kiln can also save five labor units.

These innovations at the plant cost little and are simple and easy to implement. The tap hole opening machine was designed and manufactured by Cao Hengfu and Cao Wenhua, brothers who worked in the repair team. When manufacturing this machine, they did not have ready-made steel and could not draw diagrams (the plant did not have technical personnel). They modified it while experimenting based on the principle of prospecting drill bits. The machine required two bevel gears, which the plant did not have and could not buy temporarily. Cao Hengfu ran around to old goods stores and bought two discarded gears from cars, modified them, and used them as substitutes. The drill bit on the machine needed to be made from a two-and-a-half-meter-long iron rod, but the plant only had a small lathe that was three and a half feet long and could not process such long parts. Taking it to an external factory for processing required drawings. They consulted with the workers in the machine repair team and changed the drill bit to three sections: one end was the drill bit, one end was the shaft core, and a piece of old water pipe was put in the middle. After this modification, the shaft core was only over fifty centimeters long, and the lathe in their own factory could process it.

The tap hole closing machine was successfully trial-produced by Chen Wenlong, a furnace worker from the plant's No. 4 furnace, after being inspired by a visit to Nanjing High-Speed Steel Plant. Prior to this, Chen Wenlong had wanted to use the principle of a mousetrap, using spring tension to send the mud gun. However, processing this kind of spring required high technical skills and was difficult to find materials. After visiting the High-Speed Steel Plant, he saw that using the self-weight of an iron block to close the tap hole was very simple in structure and did not cost much. Based on the experience he learned, he used several discarded furnace drills to weld together a machine. When welding, the welders were busy and could not keep up, so he took advantage of the welders' meal breaks to learn to weld himself. After several days of effort, he finally installed the tap hole closing machine on the No. 4 furnace.

After these three innovations were successfully tested, they were presented at the Nanjing Small Blast Furnace Iron Smelting On-Site Conference held at the end of May and were unanimously praised by the delegates who attended the meeting, who expressed that they would immediately promote them after returning to their units.

Explanation: The tap hole opening machine is a machine used to open the previously closed tap hole, replacing the past manual operation. Its advantages are:

	① Quick opening, reducing the average time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes;
	② Mechanization of manual operation, saving labor;
	③ Accurate opening and no vibration impact on the furnace lining;
	④ Simple structure and low material consumption.

Currently, the tap hole opening machine still has some minor problems, such as requiring a person to control the drill rod; the equipment does not have a fixed position and needs to be lifted away after opening; the position cannot be adjusted, and operation is still somewhat inconvenient.

The tap hole closing machine is a semi-mechanized tool used to replace manual tap hole closing. It has the following advantages:

	① Remote operation, workers are not threatened by high-temperature radiant heat, and operation is safe;
	② Workers are freed from heavy labor;
	③ The equipment is simple, easy to manufacture, and has great practical value. (Attached pictures)

    南京跃进钢厂革新三项重要设备
    为安全生产创造条件
    开口堵口用机器  烧结矿石有圆窑
    本报南京9日电　南京跃进钢铁厂工人最近在小高炉上用土法实行了三项技术革新——机械开铁口、堵铁口和圆窑烧结矿石，受到了全市小高炉炼铁单位职工的普遍欢迎。
    跃进钢铁厂是去年全民大炼钢铁时，由土高炉群发展起来的，现有十三立方公尺高炉四座。半年来，这个厂由于建立了一系列的管理制度，使生铁产量和质量始终稳步上升。最近，这个厂的工人又继续在保证安全生产和减轻劳动强度等方面积极开展技术革新，获得了很大的成绩。
    小高炉开铁口和堵铁口一向是用手工操作的。过去，炉前工开铁口的时候，要一人紧靠炉壁扶住铁钎，一人用鎯头在后面敲打。这样操作，因为时间较长（约二十至三十分钟），劳动强度大，同时鎯头敲得不准，还会发生事故。在堵铁口的时候，工人要面对从炉口喷出的火焰，用铁钎子快把泥泡送进铁口；由于炉前温度很高，动作慢了还可能被烫或烧坏工作服。现在，他们试制了开铁口机，操作的时候，只要开动马达，机器钻头几分钟之内就可以把铁口钻开，不仅减轻了劳动强度，并且工作效率显著提高。用堵口机堵铁口，工人只要站在火焰侧面较远的地方，把吊住泥泡的绳子猛一放松，就能够准确地把铁口堵住；因为不用靠近火焰操作，工人的安全也因此得到了保证。
    圆窑烧结矿石是这个厂的工人在原来用方窑烧结的基础上改进的。用方窑烧结，每烧一窑需要将近一天半的时间，而且烧一窑就要点一次火，因此引火用的燃料耗量大。同时，因为方窑面积大，“火候”不易掌握，烧出的矿石不是没有烧透就是烧过了头，质量不高。现在改用圆窑烧结，只要开炉的时候点一次火，以后就可以连续加进原料及少量焦炭屑，每两个半小时可以出一批烧结矿。据统计，用这种窑烧结，每窑每月可以节约芦柴六千公斤，焦炭屑二十吨，烧结矿的合格率在90％以上。因为装窑简便，每窑还可以节省五个劳动力。
    这个厂的这几项革新，花钱不多，简便易行。开铁口机是修机组工人曹恒富和曹文华兄弟俩设计和制造的。他们在制造这台机器的时候，没有现成的钢材，又不会画图（厂里没有技术人员），他们根据勘探机钻头的原理，边试边改。机器上需要两只伞形齿轮，厂里没有，一时也买不到，曹恒富就到处跑旧货店，买了两只汽车上的废齿轮，改了改代用；机器上的钻头要用二公尺半长的铁杆加工，厂里只有一台三尺半的小车床，不能加工这么长的零件，拿到外厂加工又没有图纸。他们便和机修组工人商量，把钻头改为三节，一头是钻头，一头是轴芯，中间套一根旧自来水管。这样改过以后，轴芯只有五十多公分长，自己厂里的车床就可以加工了。
    堵口机是这个厂四号炉炉前工陈文龙在一次参观南京高速钢铁厂的时候受到启发试制成功的。在这以前，陈文龙曾想根据捕鼠夹的原理，利用弹簧拉力来送泥泡。但是加工这种弹簧，技术要求高，材料也比较难找。参观高速钢铁厂以后，他看到利用铁块自重堵铁口结构很简单，不要花什么钱。便根据学来的经验，利用几根报废的炉钎焊接成一台机器。焊接的时候，电焊工任务紧，忙不过来，他就趁电焊工吃饭的空子自己学着焊，经过几天努力，终于在四号炉上装上了这台堵口机。
    这三项革新试验成功以后，曾在5月底召开的南京市小高炉炼铁现场会议上作了介绍，受到了到会代表的一致好评，纷纷表示回去后要立即加以推广。　（谢祖荫）
    说明：开口机　是用来打开原来堵死的出铁口的一种机械，它代替了过去的手工操作。它的优点是：
    ①开口快，平均由过去的三十分钟减少到五分钟；
    ②使手工操作机械化，节省劳动力；
    ③开口准确，而且对炉衬没有震动的影响；
    ④构造简单，用材少。
    目前开口机还存在一些小问题，如还要用人掌握钻杆；设备没有固定位置，开口完了还需要抬开；位置不能调正，操作上还有些不便。
    堵口机　是用来代替人工堵出铁口的半机械化的工具。它有以下优点：
    ①远距离操作，工人不受高温辐射热的威胁，操作安全；
    ②工人从繁重的劳动中解放出来；
    ③设备简单，制造容易，实用价值大。（附图片）
