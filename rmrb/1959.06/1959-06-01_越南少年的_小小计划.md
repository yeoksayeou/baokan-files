    Vietnamese Youths' "Small Plan"
    In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, young people are carrying out a "Small Plan" movement. This movement was first initiated by the young people of Nam Định Province. Seeing that their parents and uncles were enthusiastically implementing the country's Three-Year Plan, they also combined their activities with the country's requirements. Initially, this movement was simply about accumulating fertilizer and buying farm tools to send to agricultural production cooperatives. Later, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Youth League, the "Small Plan" movement expanded into a movement to help agricultural production, such as accumulating fertilizer, planting experimental fields, collectively participating in the fight against drought, and collectively catching pests, etc.
      The "Small Plan" movement quickly spread to many provinces and cities in northern Vietnam. Some places saw new forms of activity emerge, attracting a large number of children to participate. For example, organizing "Small Cooperatives," "Tender Bamboo Shoot Cooperatives," "Small Livestock Farms," "Winter-Spring Expedition Teams," "Satellite Fields," and so on.
    When the Ninth Session of the National Assembly of Vietnam was held, 600 representatives of children from Haiphong City also held a meeting. They used the money they had saved to buy machines to dedicate to the National Assembly and proposed to open a factory with their labor and savings to contribute to the early realization of the Three-Year Plan for the motherland. The Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam replied with a warm welcome and decided to name the Haiphong Plastic Factory under construction as the "Vietnam Young Pioneers Plastic Factory."
    The initiative of the Haiphong youths received an enthusiastic response from all the children in North Vietnam. The State Bank of Vietnam has savings accounts for Vietnamese children. The savings deposits of Hanoi children in the bank alone reached 1,570 Vietnamese dong. In the countryside, young people are also planting experimental fields. They work for production in a planned way and save their usual pocket money in the bank to help build the "Young Pioneers Plastic Factory."

    越南少年的“小小计划”
    在越南民主共和国，少年们正在开展一个“小小计划”运动。这个运动是南定省的少年首倡的。他们看见自己的父母、叔伯们都在热情沸腾地执行国家的三年计划，也跟着把自己的活动和国家的要求结合起来。最初，这个运动只是积肥和买农具送给农业生产合作社。后来，在越南劳动青年团中央委员会的领导下，这个“小小计划”运动扩大成为一个帮助农业生产的运动，如积肥、种试验田、集体参加抗旱斗争、集体捕捉害虫等等。
      “小小计划”运动很快就扩展到越南北方的许多省市。有些地方出现了一些新的活动形式，吸引着广大的少年儿童参加。例如组织“小小合作社”、“嫩笋合作社”、“小畜牧场”、“冬春探险队”、“卫星田”等等。
    当越南国会第九次会议召开时，海防市六百个少年儿童代表也召开会议，他们把平日储蓄的钱买机器献给国会，并提议以他们的劳动和节约所得来开设一个工厂，为祖国早日实现三年计划作出贡献。越南民主共和国国会常务委员会回信表示热烈欢迎，并且决定把正在建设中的海防塑料厂命名为“越南少年先锋塑料厂”。
    海防少年的倡议获得了北越全体少年儿童的热烈响应。在越南国家银行里开有越南少年儿童的储蓄账户，仅河内市少年在银行里的储蓄存款就达到一千五百七十元越币。在农村中，少年们也在种试验田，他们有计划地为生产而劳动，并节省平日零用钱寄存在银行里，用来帮助“少年先锋塑料厂”的建设。
