Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Since the "Common Market" treaty of the six Western European countries (West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) came into effect on January 1 this year, various monopoly capital groups in the six participating countries have intensified their collusion in order to strengthen their competitive ability within and outside the "Common Market" and cope with the life-and-death market competition in the capitalist world. On the other hand, with the development of the overall economic crisis in the capitalist world, intense conflicts of interest and contradictions have broken out within them.

According to the Associated Press, factory owners in the six countries have expanded their alliances in the past six months and organized many supranational manufacturers' associations.

Some large enterprises in the six countries have reached various agreements, including cooperation in production, the establishment of new trusts, and even complete mergers.

Supranational trusts composed of large enterprises from the six countries are constantly emerging.

Direct mergers include the two largest machine tool production companies in France and West Germany: Charpente in France and Schiess in West Germany. One accounts for 80% of France's similar products, and the other accounts for 70% of West Germany's similar products.

One of the purposes of the collusion among major enterprises in the six countries is to covet regions outside the "Common Market" and compete with monopoly groups in the United States and Britain. At the same time, this collusion itself also means the concentration and merger of capital within the six-nation group. In some of the monopoly organizations jointly formed by the six countries, the most powerful West German capital controls the majority. The French magazine "New France" pointed out that of the ten major monopoly organizations already established in the "Common Market" group, West Germany controls seven, while France controls only one (oil).

Because this law of capitalist economics, where the weak are prey to the strong, is at play, the infighting among the monopoly organizations of the six "Common Market" countries is in full swing.

The "Common Market" treaty stipulates that import tariffs between the six countries should be gradually eliminated, with the first step being a 10% reduction this year. However, according to a report issued by the six-nation group in April, in order to prevent large imports of certain commodities, the governments of the six countries have increased the consumption tax on these commodities, thereby offsetting the effect of reducing tariffs.

According to the Swiss "Voice of Labor," after the six "Common Market" countries reduced tariffs, the customs and financial institutions of the six countries competed to formulate complicated procedures for the import of goods from other member states, and created new obstacles to hinder the import of goods from other countries.

The "Common Market" treaty requires the relaxation of import quotas from other member states, but this provision has not been seriously observed due to the different interests of each country.

It is particularly noteworthy that within the "Coal and Steel Community," the earliest monopoly organization established within the "Common Market," the disputes over the coal industry crisis and steel prices have become increasingly fierce. In order to solve this problem, the "Coal and Steel Community" group has held countless secret and public meetings, but has been unable to break the deadlock. The dispute over steel prices occurred recently between France and West Germany, who appear to be on good terms. Because French steel products artificially lowered export prices after the devaluation of the franc, and seized a portion of the market in the "Common Market" countries, especially in West Germany, West Germany took the lead in coercing the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" group to demand that France increase the export tax on steel products by 4%. However, according to Reuters on June 2, the French government recently formally rejected this request.

The deep and widespread conflict of interests among the monopoly capital groups of the six countries has plunged this so-called "common" six-nation market into serious contradictions that are disintegrating as soon as it takes effect. With the development of the overall economic crisis in the capitalist world, its internal and external contradictions will be further exposed and intensified.

### 一面互相勾结　一面互相倾轧  西欧“共同市场”内矛盾尖锐

    一面互相勾结　一面互相倾轧
    西欧“共同市场”内矛盾尖锐
    新华社10日讯　自从今年1月1日西欧六国（西德、法国、意大利、荷兰、比利时和卢森堡）“共同市场”条约生效以来，参加“共同市场”六国的各种垄断资本集团加紧互相勾结，以便加强它们在“共同市场”内外的竞争能力，来应付资本主义世界中你死我活的市场争夺战。另一方面，随着资本主义世界经济总危机的发展，它们内部却又爆发了重重的利害冲突和矛盾。
    据美联社报道，六国的工厂主半年来扩大了联合，组织起不少超国家的厂商总会。
    六国有些部门的大企业已经达成各式各样的协议，包括在生产上合作、成立新的托辣斯，甚至完全合并。
    由六国大企业联合组成的超国家托辣斯正在不断出现。
    直接合并的则有法国和西德两家最大的生产机床的公司——法国的夏尔培蒂埃和西德的席斯。这两家公司一家占法国同类产品的80％，一家占西德同类产品的70％。
    六国各大企业相互勾结的目的之一，是觊觎“共同市场”以外的地区，同美英等国的垄断集团一决雌雄。同时，这种勾结的本身还意味着六国集团内部资本的集中和兼并。在六国联合组成的一些垄断组织中，大多数是由力量最雄厚的西德资本控制的。法国“新法兰西”周刊指出，“共同市场”集团已经成立的十个主要垄断组织中，西德控制了七个，而法国只控制了一个（石油）。
    由于这种弱肉强食的资本主义经济规律在起作用，所以，“共同市场”六国垄断组织彼此之间的勾心斗角正方兴未艾。
    “共同市场”条约规定六国之间要逐步取消商品进口关税，今年第一步先降低关税10％。但是，据六国集团4月间发表的一个报告指出，六国政府为了不让某些商品大量输入，便增加这些商品的消费税，从而抵消了降低关税的作用。
    据瑞士“工人之声报”报道，“共同市场”六国在降低关税后，六国的海关和财政机构又竞相对其他成员国商品的输入制订了繁琐的手续，并且制造了新的障碍，以阻挠别国商品的进口。
    “共同市场”条约要求放宽从其他成员国进口的限额，但是由于每个国家各有其利害打算，这个规定并没有被认真遵守。
    特别值得注意的是，在“共同市场”范围内最先成立的垄断组织——“煤钢联营”的内部，关于煤业危机和钢价问题的争吵已经愈来愈激烈。为了解决这个问题，“煤钢联营”集团已经不知开了多少次秘密和公开的会议，但是一直无法打开僵局。至于钢价问题的争吵则发生在近来表面上打得火热的法国和西德之间。由于法国钢产品在法郎贬值后人为地降低了出口价格，而在“共同市场”各国，特别是在西德夺得了一部分市场，西德便带头胁迫“煤钢联营”集团的“高级机构”要求法国增加钢产品出口税4％。但是，据路透社6月2日报道，法国政府最近已经正式拒绝了这个要求。
    六国垄断资本集团之间深刻而范围广泛的利害冲突，使这个美其名曰“共同”的六国市场在一生效就陷入了分崩离析的重重矛盾中。而随着资本主义世界经济总危机的发展，它的内部和外部矛盾将进一步暴露和激化。
