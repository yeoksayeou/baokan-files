We Must Take Quality Seriously
Shanghai Tool Factory Visits Users to Solicit Opinions and Improve Products
Honestly Responsible to the End

    This newspaper Shanghai, 4th Dispatch. Workers, technicians, and administrative leaders of the Shanghai Tool Factory, by visiting users, have identified existing problems with tool quality and clarified the direction for product improvement.

    The Shanghai Tool Factory produces tens of millions of tools each year, which are used in almost all machinery factories and workshops across the country. Even one substandard product leaving the factory will affect the output and quality of machinery factories, and affect their completion of state plans.

    In the past, Shanghai Tool Factory employees did not have a deep understanding of the role their produced tools played in other factories. Therefore, when formulating production increase and conservation plans, they often only calculated how much output value and products the factory increased, and how much more funds could be accumulated for the state. Through visits, they saw that due to poor tool quality, some machine tools could not be delivered on schedule, and some precision machine parts were scrapped in the final process because one tooth of a gear milling cutter was one thread too high. The employees who went out to visit felt more and more heartache. Faced with these vivid examples, the workers concretely and profoundly realized that their production had a huge relationship with national construction. This gave every worker the most vivid lesson on the necessity of attaching importance to product quality.

    Users are the best mirror, and users have the most thorough understanding of product quality. Shanghai Tool Factory's product quality has always enjoyed a good reputation in the country. Since the Great Leap Forward, some products have improved, but the quality of some products has shown a downward trend. There were not completely consistent views within the factory on the products whose quality had declined. Some believed that the raw materials were not good, and some believed that the users' operation was not good, or that there was a problem with the processed material. During the visits, users used comparative methods to provide opinions on the Shanghai Tool Factory and other tool factories' products of the same type, from the product's life, performance, and structure, and asked them to test them on the spot. Several types of cutting tools produced by the Shanghai Tool Factory did not have good wear resistance. What was the reason, and which link caused it, could not be concluded for a long time. A worker from a user factory pointed out that the tool's wear resistance was poor at the beginning of cutting, and then the wear resistance was strong. This was an important discovery. Through this clue, the reason for the tool's poor wear resistance was found. It turned out that it occurred in the grinding machine processing step.

    Through visits to users, the birth of new products at the Shanghai Tool Factory was also promoted. The tap for drilling screw holes produced by the Shanghai Tool Factory used to be a set of three, and processing a screw hole required three processes. This set of tools and operating methods was no longer popular in processing plants during the Great Leap Forward. Some machinery factories have adopted a set of two taps. This tool is easy to operate, and the tool factory also saves materials and labor when manufacturing it. The Shanghai Tool Factory is now preparing to produce this tap.

    Through visits to users, the employees of the Shanghai Tool Factory naturally developed a strong sense of responsibility to think about everything for the users and for national construction. The entire factory immediately ranked the users' opinions according to their importance and urgency, from strengthening raw material inspection to conducting cutting tests before leaving the factory, and formulated 193 measures. Some users pointed out that some insert tools had to be scrapped as a whole because one insert was broken. Now the factory is starting to produce some insert accessories. Other seemingly small aspects have also been improved. For example, the performance and specification instructions on each tool were previously manually knocked with steel character molds, and some were not clear. Now a simple typewriter has been manufactured, which is fast and clear.

    In March and April, the Shanghai Tool Factory visited more than 60 machinery factories in seven major cities across the country, and brought back tools with poor quality and defective products caused by poor tool quality to the factory for exhibition, and carried out education for all employees. Now this factory is combining user opinions to mobilize all employees to speak out freely and further carry out the "high-quality and high-yield" competition.

### 对待质量必须严肃认真  上海工具厂访问用户征求意见改进产品  老老实实负责到底

    对待质量必须严肃认真  
    上海工具厂访问用户征求意见改进产品
    老老实实负责到底
    本报上海4日电　上海工具厂工人、技术人员、行政领导干部通过访问用户，摸清了工具质量存在的问题，明确了改进产品的方向。
    上海工具厂每年要生产几千万件工具，几乎遍及全国各机械工厂和车间；只要有一件次品出厂，就会影响机械工厂的产量和质量，影响他们完成国家计划。
    过去，上海工具厂职工对自己生产的工具在别的工厂里发挥什么作用，了解不深。因此，在制订增产节约计划的时候，往往只算本厂增加多少产值和产品，可以多为国家积累多少资金。通过访问，他们看到，由于工具质量不好，有的机床不能如期交货，有些精密的机器部件，在最后一道工序上由于齿轮铣刀有一片刀片高了一丝，结果成了废品。出外访问的职工越看越心痛。在这些活生生的事例面前，工人们具体深刻地体会到自己的生产和国家建设的关系太大了。这给每一个工人上了一堂最生动的必须重视产品质量课。
    用户是一面最好的镜子，使用者对产品质量的了解最为透彻。上海工具厂产品质量在国内一直享有很好的声誉，大跃进以来，有些产品有了提高，有些产品质量却有下降趋势。厂内对质量下降的产品，看法不完全一致，有的认为是原材料不好，有的认为是用户操作不好，或是加工物有问题。在访问中，用户用对比办法，把上海工具厂和其它工具厂生产的同类型产品，从产品寿命、性能、结构各个方面提出了意见，并请他们当场试验。上海工具厂生产的有几种刀具，耐磨性能不好，究竟什么原因，是哪一道环节造成的，长时期做不出结论。有一个使用厂的工人提出了刀具在开始切削时，耐磨性能差，以后耐磨性强。这是一个重要的发现，通过这条线索找到了刀具耐磨性差的原因，原来发生在磨床加工这道工序上。
    通过对用户的访问，还促进了上海工具厂新产品的诞生。上海工具厂生产的钻螺丝眼的丝锥，过去一直是三只一套，加工一个螺丝眼要经过三道工序。这一套工具和操作方法，在大跃进中已经不受加工厂欢迎。有的机械厂采用了二只一套的丝锥。这种工具，操作方便，工具厂制造时也节省材料，节约人工。上海工具厂现在正着手准备生产这种丝锥。
    通过访问用户，上海工具厂职工很自然地产生了一切为用户着想、为国家建设着想的强烈责任感。全厂立即根据用户意见分别轻重缓急进行排队，从加强原材料检验一直到出厂前进行切削试验，制定了一百九十三条措施。有些用户提出，有一些镶片刀具由于有一片刀具坏了，整只刀具就只好报废，现在工厂正着手生产一部分刀片配件。另外一些看来很细小的方面，也作了改进，如每只刀具上的性能、规格说明，过去是用钢字模手工敲的，有的就不清楚，现在制造了一部简易的打字机，又快又清晰。
    上海工具厂3、4月份访问了全国七大城市六十多家机械工厂，并且把质量不好的工具和因工具质量不好造成的废品带回厂内展览，向全厂职工进行教育。现在这个厂正结合用户意见，动员全厂职工大鸣大放，进一步开展“优质高产”的竞赛运动。
