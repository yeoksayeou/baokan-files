    A Scrap of Iron

    In our lives, there are many small things that often go unnoticed, but when your shoelace is missing a metal tip and you can't thread it through the eyelet, or when your flashlight is missing a part and you can't turn it on, you will feel very inconvenienced.

    A scrap of iron may seem insignificant, but in Shanghai, many neighborhood factories use these scraps to make various daily necessities, meticulously serving the people.

    After the Shanghai Yifeng Enamel Factory makes eleven washbasins from a sheet of iron, seven feet wide and three feet long, the leftover scraps are used by the workers to make twenty-five small teacups. The scraps left over from making the teacups used to be treated as waste, but now they are transported to three other factories to manufacture other products.

    At the entrance of the "June 1st" Toy Factory workshop, there are piles of irregularly shaped scrap iron. Anyone who doesn't know better would think it's waste material. In fact, it's material that the purchasing agent just brought from the Yifeng factory by tricycle. The workers take these scraps and classify them by size and thickness, cutting them into different shapes suitable for making various parts. A toy airplane has thirty kinds of parts, all of which can be made from scraps. The workers here put the iron on the punch press, turning it left and right, like a skilled tailor handling cloth. Sometimes a piece of iron can't make two upper fuselage parts, so they make one upper fuselage and one lower fuselage. If there's not enough for a lower fuselage, they make a spar; if there's not enough for a spar, they make a wheel disc... Even a piece as small as a copper coin can be used to make several airplane bearings. In this way, an airplane can be made entirely from scraps.

    Even smaller pieces of iron are transported to the Gu Rongxing Pants Button Factory. This factory specializes in manufacturing pants buttons for clothing, and its monthly production can supply 1.5 million pairs of pants.

    The scrap iron is taken to this factory, where it is punched, holed, and drawn into stems, and the pants buttons are made. After two procedures of painting and electroplating, they become strong and shiny pants buttons. To increase production, the workers recently used their brains and installed a rotary punch mold on the punch press, so three procedures can be completed in one go.

    Perhaps some people think that even smaller pieces of iron would be useless! No, we have seen that the Shanghai Hardware Shoe Eyelet Factory can still use these things to manufacture the famous Eagle brand shoe eyelets!

    The iron raw materials used by this factory are no larger than the size of a palm, and some are even smaller than a coat button. However, after punching, curling, holing, flaring, painting, and electroplating, they become beautiful shoe eyelets. Two and a half button-sized pieces of iron can make ten shoe eyelets, enough for people to make a pair of leather shoes.

    A sheet of iron becomes smaller and smaller after being "eaten" by the punch presses of several factories. But in Shanghai, even a long strip of iron that is only three-tenths of an inch wide still has its use. Don't the ends of people's shoelaces have a metal tip wrapped around them? With it, it can prevent the shoelace from fraying and also make it easier to thread the lace through the eyelet. The Shanghai Da Zhonghua Shoelace Factory uses three-tenths of an inch wide iron to make shoelace tips, and now they produce seven or eight thousand gross of shoelace tips every month, supplying them to all parts of the country.

    一角铁皮
    在我们生活中，有许多小东西常常不为一般人所注意，但是，当你的鞋带上少了个铁皮带头而穿不进鞋眼的时候，当你的电筒上缺了个零件而按不亮的时候，你就会感到很不方便。
    一角铁皮，看起来算不了什么，可是，上海有许多里弄工厂，就是拿这种零零碎碎的铁皮制出许多种日用必需品，精心为人们服务的。
    上海益丰搪瓷厂把一张七尺宽、三尺长的铁皮打成了十一个面盆以后，剩下来的边边角角，又被工人们做成二十五只小茶杯；做完茶杯之后的下脚，过去就当作废料处理了，现在，却被运到另外三个工厂去制造别的产品。
    “六一”玩具厂的车间门口，堆着一些七角八棱的碎铁皮。不明究竟的人，一定以为这是他们用过后的废料；其实这是采购员刚从益丰厂用三轮车运来的材料。工人们把这些铁皮拿来按大小厚薄分类，剪成适合做各种零件的不同形状，一架玩具飞机有三十种零件，都可以用零料碎料来做。这里的工人们把铁皮放在冲床上，左转右移，就像个巧裁缝处理他手里的衣料一样。有时一块铁皮打不出两个上机身；就打一个上机身和一个下机身；打下机身不够，就打夹板；打夹板不够，就打轮盘……即使像铜元那么一小块，也能打出几只飞机轴承。这样，一架飞机就可以完全用零碎的下脚料制成了。
    更小一些的铁皮，运到了顾荣兴裤扣厂。这家工厂专门制造人们服装上的裤扣，每月的产品可供做一百五十万条裤子用。
    碎铁皮拿到这个工厂，经过冲片、打眼和抽梗，裤扣就做成了；再经过喷漆、电镀两道手续，便成了又牢又亮的裤扣。为了提高产量，工人们最近开动脑筋，在冲床上装了一个转盘冲模，三道工序因此可以一道完成。
    也许有人认为，比这还要小的铁皮不会再有用了吧！不，我们看到上海五金鞋眼厂还能用这些东西制造了有名的鹰球牌鞋眼呢！
    这个厂所用的铁皮原料，大的不过掌心大小，小的还不到大衣钮扣那么大。可是，经过冲片、卷沿、打眼、开花、喷漆和电镀以后，便成了漂亮的鞋眼。两块半钮扣大小的铁片，可以做出十个鞋眼，足够人们做一双皮鞋用。
    一张铁皮，经过几个工厂的冲床“吃”过以后，越来越小了。可是在上海，即使是三分宽的长铁皮，也还有它的用处。人们鞋带的两头，不都有一个铁质的鞋带头裹着吗？有了它，一则可以防止鞋带发毛松散，二来便于把带子穿进鞋眼里。上海大中华鞋带厂就用三分宽的铁皮做成了鞋带头，现在他们每月要生产七、八千罗鞋带头，供应全国各地。
