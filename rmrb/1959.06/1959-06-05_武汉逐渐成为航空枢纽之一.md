Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Wuhan is gradually becoming one of the national aviation transportation hubs. At present, Wuhan has direct and indirect air connections with 66 large and medium-sized cities across the country, including 12 cities with direct air connections. Recently, three new routes have been opened to Enshi and Danjiangkou Reservoir in remote mountainous areas of Hubei Province.

Wuhan's air transport is busier year by year. Now, Wuhan Airport has an average of 12 takeoffs and landings per day, and the number of scheduled flights per week has increased from 4 in the early days of liberation to 48. Since last year, not only has the number of passengers increased, but civil aviation aircraft have also directly done a lot of work for the development of industrial and agricultural production. During the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, especially before the No. 1 blast furnace of WISCO produced iron, civil aviation aircraft transported many urgently needed important equipment to Wuhan from Northeast China and other places.

    武汉逐渐成为航空枢纽之一
    据新华社武汉讯　武汉市正逐渐成为全国航空运输的枢纽之一。目前，武汉市已经直接和间接与全国六十六个大、中城市通航，其中直接通航的城市有十二个；最近还开辟了通往湖北省边远山区恩施、丹江水库等三条航线。
    武汉市空运繁忙情况一年胜过一年。现在，武汉航空站每天平均起落飞机十二架次，每周定期开航的班次由解放初期的四班增加到四十八班。去年以来，不但乘客人数增多，民航飞机还直接为发展工农业生产做了许多工作。在武汉钢铁公司建设中，特别是武钢一号高炉出铁前夕，民航飞机从东北等地运输了许多急需的重要器材到武汉。
