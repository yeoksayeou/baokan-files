    Middle School Chinese Textbooks Should Include Some Classical Literature
    Chen Deqing, Teacher at Dajing Middle School, Yueqing County, Zhejiang

    In the fall of 1956, the People's Education Publishing House published a set of literature textbooks that included a considerable number of classical works as teaching materials. Because some of these works did not contain healthy enough thoughts and feelings and were not suitable for our socialist society's youth to read, they were criticized. This was entirely correct. However, this does not mean that middle school students should not study classical literature. The current junior high school Chinese textbooks do not include classical works, and the senior high school Chinese textbooks only include two classical works. I think it is necessary to discuss whether this is appropriate.

    Our education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor. Our selection of materials for Chinese textbooks should resolutely implement the Party's education policy. We should emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past, and select exemplary revolutionary political essays and literary works that correctly and profoundly reflect the realities of struggle as the majority of the teaching materials in Chinese textbooks. This is entirely certain. However, we cannot assume that selecting appropriate amounts of classical works with correct content and ideological tendencies as middle school Chinese teaching materials will hinder the implementation of the Party's education policy.

    We are standing on the foundation of socialism and heading towards the future of communism. But at this time, and only at this time, is it more important than ever to inherit the excellent traditions of our national cultural heritage. Our ancestors, the working people in our country's history, have indeed left us a valuable literary heritage. Many works are not only correct and profound in content, but also beautiful and moving in form, and have been passed down through the generations by the working people. Today, we are in a better position than ever before to absorb the essence of this heritage. After rectification, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the opposition to the bad habit of bourgeois emphasis on the past and neglect of the present, people's ability to distinguish between essence and dross has greatly improved. Those comrades who do not agree with selecting classical works for middle school textbooks are keenly aware of the serious harm of emphasizing the past and neglecting the present. They are acting out of good intentions, wanting to prevent our young students from being eroded by feudal and bourgeois ideas. This is undoubtedly very correct. However, some people have overlooked the classical literature that suits the psychological characteristics of our young people and can help them understand the life history of our working people. I believe it is also necessary to appropriately select a portion of these works to be included in textbooks as teaching materials.

    However, my advocacy for selecting appropriate amounts of classical works as teaching materials in middle school Chinese teaching is different from the tendency of emphasizing the past and neglecting the present. First of all, those who emphasize the past and neglect the present proceed from the bourgeois standpoint, flaunt the reactionary views of "pure art, beyond politics," and arbitrarily praise and criticize ancient works, leading people to look backward and detaching teaching from politics and productive labor. We, on the other hand, are doing this in order to make people understand history, and thereby educate people to recognize the superiority of today's society, and also to develop our communist culture, to truly inherit the excellent traditions of the nation, and to make the past serve the present. Second, those who emphasize the past and neglect the present affirm ancient works without discrimination, and even the dross in excellent works is not criticized. They superficially praise "classical literature," but in reality, they cannot recognize the meaning of classical literature. We are different. We only advocate selecting a portion of works that are excellent, rich in democratic spirit, and suitable for students to read as teaching materials.

    Therefore, I believe that the relevant departments should comprehensively consider and include some of the brilliant works in our literary history that are indeed suitable for middle school students to read in textbooks.

### 中学语文课本要选些古典文学作品

    中学语文课本要选些古典文学作品
    浙江乐清县大荆中学教师　陈得庆
    1956年秋季，人民教育出版社出版的一套文学课本中，选取了相当一部分古典作品作为教材，因为其中某些作品的思想感情不够健康，不宜让我们社会主义社会的青少年阅读，因而受到人们的批评。这完全是正确的。然而，这不等于说中学生不应该学古典文学作品。现在的初中语文课本中不选古典作品，在高中语文课本中只选了两篇古典作品。这样做，是否妥当，我认为有商榷的必要。
    我们的教育，必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须与生产劳动相结合。我们语文课本的选材，应该坚决贯彻党的教育方针，应该厚今薄古，选取典范的革命的政论文和正确而深刻地反映现实斗争的文学作品，作为语文课本的大部分的教材，这完全是肯定的。但是，我们并不能由此以为，选取适量的、内容正确、思想倾向性正确的古典作品作为中学语文教材，就会妨碍贯彻党的教育方针。
    我们立足于社会主义基础之上，奔赴共产主义的前程，但在这时，而且也只有在这时，继承自己民族文化遗产的优秀传统，比过去任何时候就更显得重要。我们的祖先，我们祖国历史上的劳动人民，的确为我们留下了一份可宝贵的文学遗产。有多少作品，不但内容正确、深刻，其形式也优美动人，为历代劳动人民所传诵。我们今天比过去任何时期更具有条件来吸收遗产中的精华。我们经过整风、反右派和反对资产阶级厚古薄今的恶劣风气，人们识别精华与糟粕的能力，大大地提高了。那些不赞成在中学课本中选古典作品的同志，他们敏锐地感到厚古薄今的严重危害，他们出于一片好心，要使我国青少年学生不受封建的和资产阶级的思想侵蚀，这无疑是十分正确的。然而有些人却对古典文学中适应我国青少年的心理特征，能帮助他们认识我国劳动人民的生活历史的作品忽略了。我以为，适当地选取这些作品的一部分编入课本，作为教材，也是有必要的。
    但是，我所主张的在中等学校语文教学中选取适量的古典作品作为教材，是与厚古薄今的倾向不同的。首先，厚古薄今者们从资产阶级立场出发，标榜“纯艺术、超政治”的反动观点，胡乱地褒贬古代作品，引导人们向后看，使教学脱离政治和生产劳动；我们则是为了使人们认识历史，并从而教育人们认识今天社会的优越性，也为了发展我们的共产主义文化，为了真正继承民族的优秀传统，使古为今用。第二，厚古薄今者们不加舍取地肯定古代作品，即使是优秀的作品中的糟粕，他们也不加以批判，他们表面上颂扬“古典文学”，实际上他们是不能认识古典文学的意义的我们则不然，我们只主张把优秀的富有民主性精神的，并且适合学生阅读的一部分作品，选为教材。
    因此，我认为，有关部门应该全面地考虑，把我国文学史上的一些辉煌的作品，并且确实是适合中学生阅读的作品编入课本。
