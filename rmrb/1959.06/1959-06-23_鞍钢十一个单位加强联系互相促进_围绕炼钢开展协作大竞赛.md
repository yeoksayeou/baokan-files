At the signing ceremony of the competition contract, the representatives of the first, second, and fifth large-scale fixed open-hearth furnaces all took the stage and made guarantees, saying that they would continue to vigorously promote technological innovation, promote advanced experience in maintaining the furnace body, improve the output and quality of steel, and ensure timely pouring for the iron smelting plant and timely loading and unloading of vehicles for the transportation department. Representatives of the iron smelting plant proposed to guarantee the supply of more pig iron with less sulfur, so that the open-hearth furnaces could be fully fed. Representatives of the transportation department proposed to guarantee the completion of the transportation of steelmaking raw materials according to plan, and to transport as much steel as was produced. The refractory materials plant and Dashiqiao magnesite mine made guarantees to the steelmaking plant to supply refractory materials according to variety, quantity, and quality, and to ensure that the finished product rate of magnesite bricks and silica bricks reaches 92%.
