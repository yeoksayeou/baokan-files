Children's Habits
　　Beimen Cang Elementary School,
　　The political red flag is held high,
　　Work-study program does well,
　　Hygiene work ranks among the best.
　　The environment is clean and elegant,
　　Personal hygiene habits are good,
　　Various diseases are greatly reduced,
　　Teaching quality is greatly improved.
This is a message from a visitor to the Beijing Hygiene Red Flag Unit – Beimen Cang Elementary School.

　　When you enter this school, you get a refreshing feeling. In the morning, the children sing songs and happily wipe the windows, sweep the schoolyard, water the flowers, and clean the toilets. Red Cross health workers carefully check at the school gate whether the children have brought handkerchiefs, masks, and water bowls, and whether their clothes are clean... According to their fixed division of labor, they spend a very short time every day cleaning the yard, classrooms, and other places so thoroughly that it is difficult to find a fly even in the toilet. When the morning self-study bell rings, the students have already completed this daily "course" - cleaning. Sunlight shines through the clean glass windows, and the elementary school students sit in classrooms with fresh flowers and cleanliness, each one refreshed.

The students, having good hygiene habits, are also very enthusiastic about participating in hygiene work outside the school. They enthusiastically help parents or neighbors to develop "hygiene days" and explain hygiene knowledge. Many students also personally help their parents or neighbors with cleaning until the red flag is planted. With their help, last year 98% of student families were rated as hygiene red flag households. This year, in the pest and disease eradication campaign to welcome "May Day," more than 99% of student families have planted hygiene red flags. Teachers also lead by example, often supervising and checking each other, and all teachers' families have become hygiene red flag households.

    孩子们的习惯
    北门仓小学校，
    政治帅旗举得高，
    勤工俭学搞得好，
    卫生工作列前茅。
    环境整洁又清雅，
    个人卫生习惯好，
    各种疾病大减少，
    教学质量大提高。
    这是一个到北京市卫生红旗单位——北门仓小学校参观者的留言。
  　　　
    当你走进这个学校的时候，就使人有着一种清新的感觉。清晨，孩子们唱着歌，愉快地擦着玻璃，洒扫校院、浇花、清扫厕所。红十字卫生员，在校门口认真地检查小朋友们是否带了手绢、口罩、水碗，穿的衣服干净不干净，……。他们按着固定的分工，每天用很短的时间就把院子、教室等处打扫的干干净净，连厕所里都难找到一个苍蝇。当上早自习的铃声响时，学生们早就作完了这项每天必作的“课程”——打扫卫生。阳光射进洁净的玻璃窗，小学生们坐在放有鲜花而又清洁的教室里，个个神清气爽。
    学生们有了卫生习惯，也格外热心地参加校外的卫生工作。他们热情地帮助家长或邻居制订“卫生日”，讲解卫生常识。也有许多学生亲手帮助家长或邻居打扫卫生，直到插上了红旗为止。在他们的帮助下，去年就有98％的学生家庭，被评为是卫生红旗户。今年，在迎接“五一”的除害灭病突击运动中，99％以上的学生家庭都插上了卫生红旗。教师们也以身作则，经常相互督促、检查，所有教师的家庭都成了卫生红旗户。
