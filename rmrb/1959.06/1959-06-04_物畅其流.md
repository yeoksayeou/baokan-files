    Editor's Note:
    Correctly and actively organizing rural material exchange is an important measure to promote commodity circulation.
    In order to strengthen the planning of commune production and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, commercial departments in various places have extensively signed production and sales contracts with communes or brigades based on national plans and market needs. However, the small-scale products produced by the vast number of commune members using their spare time or holidays outside the scope of the plan cannot all be included in the contract; the adjustment of the third category of goods between communes, teams, and commune members cannot all be purchased and sold through commercial departments. This requires the planned prosperity of rural markets and the organization of rural material exchanges, so that rural areas can adjust to each other and the state can make scattered purchases; this requires, like the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, holding material exchange fairs widely and at all levels under the unified leadership of the state commercial departments.

    物畅其流
    正确地积极地组织农村物资交流，是促进商品流通的重要措施。
    为了加强公社生产的计划性和城乡物资交流，各地商业部门曾经根据国家计划和市场的需要，同公社或大队广泛地签订了产销合同。但是，广大社员利用工余或假日生产的计划范围以外的小宗产品，不可能全部纳入合同之内；公社与公社、队与队、社员与社员之间的第三类商品的调剂，也不可能全都通过商业部门购进销出。这就需要有计划地繁荣农村集市，组织农村物资交流，以便农村互相调剂和国家零星收购；这就需要像广西僮族自治区那样，在国家商业部门统一领导之下，广泛地逐级举行物资交流会。
