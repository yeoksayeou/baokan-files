Ministry of Agriculture Issues Emergency Notice

(Our report) The Ministry of Agriculture issued an emergency notice on June 10th to strive to plant more soybeans, sesame, and other oil crops.

The notice stated that, according to the current situation in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, the peanut planting plan has not been completed well. This is a serious problem. All localities must seize the peanut planting work; plant one more mu if possible, and immediately seize the summer peanut planting work. In the South, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi should strive to plant more autumn peanuts.

Wherever conditions permit, sesame and other oil crops suitable for local planting should be sown immediately. Now is the appropriate time for sesame planting. In addition to focusing on large-scale planting, mobilize communes, teams, and the masses to plant as much as possible in vacant spaces, corners, field edges, and ditch edges, and promote intercropping with other crops, such as intercropping sesame in sweet potato and soybean fields; sesame can also be replanted in peanut fields with severe seedling shortages. All localities should expand the planting area of ​​sesame and other minor oil crops as much as possible to compensate for the insufficient peanut planting area. Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang and other provinces should also expand the planting of some autumn sesame.

In North China and the Huanghuai River Basin, it is appropriate to sow soybeans after the summer harvest. All localities should not only strive to complete the established plans, but also strive to exceed them. In areas where soybeans and other crops are suitable for intercropping and have the habit of doing so, intercropping should be increased. Where spring crops are short of seedlings, soybeans should be replanted to ensure that no inch of land is wasted and to strive to harvest more soybeans to increase oil supply. (Attached picture)

    凡是条件有可能的地方，都应该立即抓紧播种芝麻以及其他适于当地播种的油料作物。目前正是芝麻播种适期，除了抓大面积种植外，要发动社、队、群众在空隙地、四角、地边、沟边，尽量种植，并提倡与其他作物间作，如甘薯、大豆地间种芝麻；缺苗严重的花生地，也可补种芝麻。各地要尽可能扩大芝麻等小油料的播种面积，以补花生播种面积的不足。江西、湖南、浙江等省，也应扩种一些秋芝麻。
    在华北和黄淮流域，夏收后适宜播种大豆。各地除抓紧完成既订计划外，并且要争取超过。在大豆和其他作物适宜间作并且有习惯的地区，要多间作。春作物缺苗的，要点补大豆，做到不荒废一寸土地，争取多收大豆，以增加油料。（附图片）
