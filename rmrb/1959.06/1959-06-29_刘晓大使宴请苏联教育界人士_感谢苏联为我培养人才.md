Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 26th: To express gratitude to the Soviet Union for helping China cultivate talent for socialist construction, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Liu Xiao hosted a banquet here on the evening of the 26th to entertain leading figures and professors from Soviet cultural, educational, and scientific institutions and universities.

Among those attending the banquet were Soviet Academy of Sciences President A.N. Nesmeyanov, Vice President Topchiev, Minister of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education Yelyutin, Minister of Health Kurashov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Pushkin, as well as heads and professors from various scientific research institutes and universities in Moscow, totaling over 150 people.

In his speech at the banquet, Ambassador Liu Xiao said: We thank the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people for their internationalist and selfless assistance to our country; we thank you for your great contributions in helping China cultivate talent for socialist construction. The Soviet Union has provided significant assistance in helping our country develop science and education and train cadres.

Ambassador Liu Xiao said that after the nationwide liberation, in order to rapidly train cadres for socialist construction and develop our own scientific and educational undertakings, our country sent many students to the Soviet Union to learn advanced science and technology and construction experience. This year alone, more than 1,300 graduates will return to China to participate in construction, which can be said to be a great harvest.

Ambassador Liu Xiao said that the young Chinese cadres trained in the Soviet Union will, following the example of Soviet communist builders and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, firmly and loyally contribute their strength to building a socialist China and to continuously strengthening the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

Yelyutin and A.N. Nesmeyanov spoke at the meeting. They first praised the spirit of the Chinese students in the Soviet Union who worked hard to study under the guidance of Soviet teachers and the achievements they have made. Yelyutin said: We believe that Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union will make their own contributions to China's socialist construction after returning home. A.N. Nesmeyanov said: 600 million Chinese people are working hard for socialist construction, and the returning graduates will definitely, like all Chinese people, display a high degree of work ethic.

Tang Xiuzhe, a representative of the returning students, and Ma Jin, a postgraduate student, expressed their gratitude in their speeches to the Soviet teachers for their teaching and help. They also expressed that after returning home, they would dedicate the valuable knowledge and experience they learned in the Soviet Union to the motherland and to the cause of developing the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

The banquet took place in a warm and friendly atmosphere.
