Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 4th: While quelling the rebellion and eliminating scattered bandits, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet is vigorously developing agricultural and sideline production, striving to achieve vegetable self-sufficiency.

This year, the Tibetan troops' production preparations began earlier than in previous years. Last winter, they reclaimed more than 2,500 mu of wasteland, deeply ploughed more than 2,000 mu of cultivated land, and accumulated more than 16 million jin of fertilizer. This spring, after the rebellion in Lhasa and other places was quelled, many troops went to the fields and carried out spring sowing on time. Now, on the banks of the Lhasa River, near Shigatse, and even in the Ali region, which is 4,000 meters above sea level, vegetables, tea and highland barley have been planted. Some troops also raised a large number of cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks.

Over the past few years, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet has created many plateau production experiences under conditions of variable temperatures and poor crop growing conditions, and has achieved bumper harvests in agricultural and sideline production. Last year, the troops stationed in the Lhasa area alone produced more than 12.4 million jin of vegetables, with the highest yield per mu reaching 15,000 jin. Their more than 600 mu of wheat and other crops also achieved large-scale high yields. In addition, the troops also established greenhouses with an area of ​​more than 12,000 square meters, enabling the troops to eat fresh vegetables in winter. In the past, only highland barley and peas could be grown here. Due to their continuous improvement of the soil and trial planting of new products, it is now possible to grow corn, winter wheat, and winter highland barley. Vegetables have also developed from a few varieties to a variety of varieties. This year, they have planted more than 20 kinds of vegetables, including lettuce and tomatoes.

    创造高原生产经验  大搞农副业生产
    驻西藏部队争取蔬菜自给
    新华社拉萨4日电中国人民解放军驻西藏部队，在平息叛乱、肃清散匪的同时，大搞农副业生产，争取做到蔬菜自给。
    今年，西藏部队的生产准备比往年早，去年冬天，他们就开荒二千五百多亩，深翻了二千多亩耕地，积肥一千六百多万斤。今春，拉萨等地叛乱平息以后，许多部队就开赴农田，按时进行了春播。现在拉萨河畔、日喀则附近，以至拔海四千多公尺的阿里地区都种植了蔬茶和青稞。有些部队还喂养了大批的牛、羊、鸡、鸭。
    几年来，驻西藏的人民解放军，在气温多变、农作物生长条件不好的情况下，创造出许多高原生产经验，获得了农副业的丰收。去年仅驻拉萨地区的部队，就生产了蔬菜一千二百四十多万斤，最高亩产量达一万五千斤。他们种的六百多亩小麦等作物也获得大面积丰产。此外，各部队还建立了面积达一万二千多平方公尺的温室，使部队冬季也能吃到新鲜蔬菜。过去这里只能种青稞、豌豆，由于他们不断改良土壤，试种新产品，现在可以种玉米、冬小麦、冬青稞了，蔬菜也由少数品种，发展到多样品种。今年他们种下的蔬菜，就有莴笋、西红柿等二十多种。
