New Blossoms of Soviet Science and Technology

Using Chemical Methods to Transform Deserts into Oases

Soviet chemists have recently successfully tested a polymer that can subdue deserts and prevent their movement. Scholars sprayed the newly invented polymer on two kilometers of desert land. Within minutes, a hard, thin layer appeared on the sand where the polymer had been sprayed. This layer could withstand the weight of a person and had excellent water permeability. Soon after, pine seeds sown here sprouted into robust seedlings, as if the test area had been covered with a green carpet. The sand was subdued. This new polymer not only strengthens the soil but is also an excellent fertilizer. This miraculous polymer, previously manufactured only in laboratories, has now begun production.

New-Style High-Speed Tractor

The Soviet Union has produced a new-style tractor model. This tractor has greater functionality than ordinary tractors. Its most significant feature is its very high speed, traveling at thirty kilometers per hour. Until now, countries around the world have mainly increased the power of tractors by increasing the scope of the farming implements suspended on them. Experiments conducted in the Soviet Union have proven that high-speed tractors have great advantages. This tractor can evenly and deeply till the land while not destroying the fertile layer of the soil. The new-style tractor is one of the 1,500 new-style agricultural machines that will be tested in Soviet fields this year.

Weaving Fabric with Colored Cotton

How can colored cotton be obtained? Naturally, one could experiment with improving wild-colored cotton varieties. But this would take a very long time. Therefore, Soviet scientists experimented with cultivating ordinary cotton varieties with white fibers into colored cotton. Early on, it was discovered that light-colored cotton bolls sometimes appeared on some cotton trees. Breeders in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan experimented with these cotton varieties. After years of careful selection and cultivation and cross-breeding, they achieved remarkable results. After several generations, the color of the fibers finally changed from very faint to very vibrant. Several types of colored cotton have now been cultivated: green, light blue, blue, yellow, brown... Not long ago, the first batch of fabric was woven with the new cotton varieties. This batch of fabric received high praise from experts.

New Type of Solar Turbine

Soviet scientists have recently invented a new type of solar turbine – the "magnetothermal" engine. It does not require the use of solar energy to boil water into steam to drive the turbine. Instead, it uses the characteristics of changes in the magnetocaloric effect of metals to use solar energy directly to rotate the turbine and drive the generator to produce electricity. This device is simple and very economical. The new engine also mainly consists of two parts: a stator and a rotor. The stator is the stationary magnet, and the rotor is the rotating part. The rotor's surface is made of certain metals that lose their magnetic effect at a certain high temperature (such as iron, which loses its magnetic attraction when heated to 753 degrees Celsius, and nickel, which loses it at 376 degrees Celsius; some alloys lose their magnetic response when heated to only 36 or 50 degrees Celsius). When the engine is not running, the magnetic lines of force of the stator can attract every part of the rotor, and the rotor cannot rotate. However, if sunlight is concentrated and shone on one part of the rotor, this part heats up to a certain temperature and loses its response to the magnetic lines of force, and the stator can no longer hold it. At this time, the stator still attracts the other parts of the rotor, creating an imbalance of attractive forces, and the rotor begins to rotate. The temperature of the heated part of the rotor begins to decrease as it rotates to the unheated part, but it begins to heat up again when it rotates to the area exposed to sunlight. This cycle continues, and the rotor rotates continuously, which can drive generators or other equipment.

This engine can be widely used for power generation and irrigation in sunny areas.

The Moon's Surface is a Layer of Volcanic Ash-Like Rock

Soviet astronomer Barabashov, after research, has recently arrived at a new theory about the structure of the Moon: the Moon's surface is covered with a layer of volcanic ash-like rock, with an actual thickness of about three to several tens of millimeters. He believes that this layer of rock does not appear to be an obstacle for spacecraft landing on the Moon.

Professor Barabashov's theory overthrows the hypothesis that the Moon's surface is covered with a completely molten substance, or volcanic ash, cosmic dust, weathered material, or a large amount of meteoritic debris.

According to the photographs taken by Barabashov while studying the Moon, it is clear that, as some other researchers have suggested, the Moon's surface has not just one color, but red, orange, green, cyan, and other various colors. The professor also found that even the smaller lunar craters with a diameter of no more than several tens of kilometers can be distinguished by various areas of different colors, such as red around the crater and blue-green at its base.

    苏联科学技术的新花朵
    用化学方法变沙漠为绿洲
    苏联化学家在不久前试验成功一种制服沙漠、阻止沙漠移动的聚合物。学者们把新发明的聚合物喷洒到两公里的沙漠地上，几分钟后，在喷洒聚合物的沙土地上就出现了坚硬的薄层，薄层能经得住一个人的重量，具有很好的渗水性能。不久之后，在这里播下的松树种籽发出了茁壮的小树苗，试验地段好像铺上了绿色的地毯。沙土被制服了。这种新聚合物不仅能加固土壤，而且还是很好的肥料。这种奇妙的聚合物以前一直在试验室里制造，现在已经开始生产了。
    新式的快速拖拉机
    苏联制成一种新式拖拉机模型。这种拖拉机的功能比一般拖拉机高。它的最大特点：有非常高的速度，每小时行驶三十公里。直到目前为止，世界各国主要是用增大拖拉机上吊挂耕作农具辐度的办法来提高拖拉机的功率。在苏联进行的试验证明，快速拖拉机具有极大的优越性。这种拖拉机能均匀地深耕土地，同时还不破坏土壤肥沃层。新式拖拉机是今年将在苏联田野里进行试验的一千五百台新式农业机械中的一种。
    用有色棉花织布
    怎样才能获得有色的棉花？自然，可以试验改进野生着色的棉花品种。但这样做需要花很长的时间。因此，苏联科学家试验把普通的有白色纤维的棉花品种培育成有色棉花。在很早的时候，人们发现，在有的棉花树上，有时也出现淡颜色的棉铃。乌兹别克和土库曼的育种家就拿这种棉花品种进行试验。他们经过多年细心地选育栽培，进行品种杂交之后，获得了惊人的成绩。几代以后，纤维的颜色终于从非常淡变成十分鲜艳了。现在已经培育成若干种有色棉花：绿色的、浅蓝色的、蓝色的、黄色的、棕色的……不久以前，用新的棉花品种织成了第一批布匹。这一批布匹获得了专家们的好评。
    新型太阳能涡轮机
    苏联科学家最近发明了一种新型太阳能涡轮机——“磁热”发动机。它不需要通过太阳能把水烧成蒸汽推动涡轮，而利用金属磁效应变化的特点来利用太阳能直接使涡轮旋转带动发电机发电。这种装置设备简单、非常经济。新型发动机主要也是由固定子和转子两部分构成的。固定子就是固定不动的磁石，转子就是旋转的部分。转子外表在一定的高温下便会失去磁效应的某些金属制成（如铁热到摄氏七百五十三度，镍热到三百七十六度就不会被磁力所吸引，有些合金只要热到三十六度或五十度，就对磁性失去反应）。在发动机不开动的情况下，固定子的磁力线可以吸住转子的每个部分，转子不能转动。但是，如果用反射镜把太阳光集中照射在转子的一个部分，这一部分热到一定的温度，失去对磁力线的反应，固定子就吸不住它。这时，固定子对转子的另外部分仍发生吸引作用，于是就产生了吸力不平衡的现象，转子便开始旋转起来。转子受热的部分转到不受热部分温度开始下降，但转到受阳光照射的地方时，又开始受热，这样循环不已，转子便不断旋转，可以带动发电机或其他设备了。
    这种发动机可以在多阳光的地区广泛用来发电和灌溉田地。
    月亮表面是一层火山灰状岩山
    苏联天文学家巴拉巴绍夫经过研究后，最近得出了一个关于月球构造的新理论：月球表面覆盖着一层火山灰状的岩石，它们的实际厚度约三至数十公厘。他认为，这一层岩石看来不会成为宇宙飞船在月球上着陆的障碍。
    巴拉巴绍夫教授的这一理论，推翻了那种认为月球表面是覆盖着一种完全熔解的物质，或火山灰烬、宇宙尘、风化物，或大量陨石滓的假说。
    根据巴拉巴绍夫在研究月球时所拍下的照片清楚地表明，正如其他一些研究者所认为的，月球表面不止一种颜色，而是有红、橙、绿、青及其他各种颜色。这位教授还查明，就连月球上直径不超过数十公里的较小的寰形山也可以区分出各种颜色不同的地方，比如寰形山周围是红色，而它的底部是蓝绿色。
