Summarizing experiences is an important method for improving the ideological level of cadres and educating the masses. By summarizing experiences, we can look back after completing a task and see what was done correctly, what methods were good, and should be continued to be promoted; and what failed, so we can learn lessons and seek improvements. Summarizing experience is grasping the law of development of things in order to better organize the battle and transform the objective world. It's like fighting a war, there are always experiences and lessons after a battle. Applying these experiences and lessons to the next battle can defeat the enemy. Agricultural production is fighting against nature, and it also needs to constantly summarize experience, so as to continuously leap forward.

Since the beginning of summer, various regions have planned to use methods such as visits, comparisons, and on-site meetings to present facts, calculate detailed accounts, and make comparisons to summarize the experience of wheat production, and combined with the specific circumstances of autumn crops, apply these experiences to set off a new upsurge in production. The valuable part of this approach is that it seizes the favorable opportunity, educates the masses with the facts they have seen with their own eyes, and uses the cadres' own experiences to improve the cadres.

    以夏促秋
    总结经验，是提高干部思想水平、教育群众的重要方法。通过总结经验，会使我们作了一件工作之后，回过头来看看，那些作对了，那些方法好，应该继续发扬；那些失败了就吸取教训，求得改进。总结经验就是掌握事物的发展规律，以便更好地去组织战斗和改造客观世界。好比打仗一样，打一个战役总有经验教训，这些经验教训运用到下一次战役中去，就能战胜敌人。农业生产是同自然界打仗，同样需要不断地总结经验，这样才能不断地向前跃进。
    各地入夏以来，有计划地用参观、评比、现场会议等方法，摆事实，算细账，作对比，总结小麦生产经验，并结合秋田作物的具体情况，运用这些经验，掀起了新的生产高潮。这种作法可贵之处，还在于它抓住了有利时机，用群众亲眼看到的事实教育群众，用干部切身的经验来提高干部。
