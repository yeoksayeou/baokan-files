Without Driving Away the US Military, There Can Be No Peaceful Life and Work
Vice President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, Lao She

The facts are starkly laid out here: In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, because they repelled the American invading army, because the people are the masters of their own house, they are riding the Chollima, with everything flourishing and taking on a new look. Look at South Korea, because Syngman Rhee sold out the country for personal gain, and the US military is stubbornly refusing to leave, the people are living in poverty and misery. The facts are so obvious, how can people with a sense of justice around the world not unanimously sympathize with the suffering people of South Korea and shout for the US military to get out of South Korea immediately!

Before liberation, the Chinese people suffered deeply and deeply understood that wherever the US military goes, disaster is sure to follow. Today, our compatriots in Taiwan are still suffering from the poison of the US military. Yes, we know from experience that wherever the US military stays, the people there cannot survive. The Chinese people once sent their sons and daughters to fight alongside the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to resist and repel the American aggression, so we also know how cruel and barbaric the US military is. The United States calls itself a civilized country, but the most barbaric acts come from the US military. How many good Korean people have the US military killed! Moreover, once the US military has gained a foothold, the most poisonous economic aggression and the most shameless dances and movies will follow. A civilized country? This is a great insult to civilization! Without driving away the US military, the people cannot live in peace and work, and cannot protect the nation's culture!

In order to promote peace, the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea, but the US military is still stubbornly staying in South Korea, and is stepping up its efforts to undermine the armistice agreement, trying to turn South Korea into a base for atomic warfare. No matter how tirelessly the Democratic People's Republic of Korea strives to achieve peaceful reunification, the United States is deliberately trying to prevent the Korean people from solving their own problems, and is preventing Korea from achieving peace and unification, thus constantly threatening Korean peace and Asian peace. The United States always has "freedom" on its lips, but it does not allow others to freely handle their own affairs. In this way, the United States' "freedom" means that it should be "free" to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, "free" to plunder other countries' wealth, "free" to dump surplus materials, "free" to traffic in arms, and "free" to open military bases. The United States' "freedom" makes others slaves. The United States is enjoying this "freedom" in South Korea, so it is no wonder that the people of South Korea are living a hellish life. Korea is so beautiful, the landscape is picturesque, and the people are lovely; but South Korea has become a hell. This is such an infuriating thing! We care about the misfortune of the South Korean people, and we care about Asian peace, so we support the struggle for the US military to withdraw immediately! We earnestly hope that Korea can be unified quickly according to the wishes of the Korean people! We say: The US military get out of South Korea!

    不赶走美军，无从安居乐业
    中朝友好协会副会长　老舍
    事实极其鲜明地摆在这里：在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国里，因为打退了美国的侵略军，因为人民当家作主，所以跨上千里马，百废俱兴，万象峥嵘；再看看南朝鲜呢，因为李承晚卖国求荣，美军赖着不走，所以民不聊生，水深火热。事实如此明显，全世界有正义感的人民怎能不一致地同情南朝鲜受难的人民，齐呼美军立即滚出南朝鲜呢！
    中国人民在解放前，身受其苦，深刻地了解美军所至，必然带来灾殃。今天，我们的台湾同胞还受着美军的毒害。是的，我们的确从经验中知道：美军留在哪里，哪里的人民就活不下去。中国人民曾经派遣自己的儿女，同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民并肩抵抗并打退美国的侵略，所以我们也知道美军如何残暴野蛮。美国自号为文明国，可是最野蛮的行为出自美军。美军杀害了多少善良的朝鲜人民啊！而且，美军一旦站住了脚，随着而来的便是最毒狠的经济侵略，最无耻的舞蹈与电影。文明国乎？这是对文明的莫大污辱！不赶走美军，人民无从安居乐业，无从卫护民族的文化！
    为促进和平，中国人民志愿军已全部撤出朝鲜，而美军依然赖在南朝鲜不走，并且加紧破坏停战协定，力图把南朝鲜变为原子战争基地。不管朝鲜民主主义人民共和国如何不懈地努力于实现和平统一，美国处心积虑不许朝鲜人民解决自己的问题，不许朝鲜得到和平与统一，因而也就随时威胁着朝鲜和平与亚洲和平。美国总把“自由”挂在嘴上，可就是不许别人自由地处理自己的家务事。这样，美国的“自由”便是它应当“自由地”干涉别国内政，“自由地”抢劫别国的财富，“自由地”倾销剩余物资，“自由地”贩卖军火，“自由地”开辟军事基地。美国的“自由”使别人成为奴隶。美国正在南朝鲜享受这种“自由”，也就难怪南朝鲜人民正过着地狱般的生活。朝鲜是多么美丽呀，江山如画，人民可爱；可是南朝鲜却变成了地狱。这是多么令人愤恨的事啊！我们关心南朝鲜人民的不幸，关心亚洲和平，所以我们支持美军必须立即撤退的斗争！我们切盼朝鲜能够按照朝鲜人民的意愿迅速地统一起来！我们说：美军从南朝鲜滚出去！
