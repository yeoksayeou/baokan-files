According to the Guangxi Daily, from the evening of the 12th to the 15th, the Yulin Special Zone experienced heavy rain, causing floods and varying degrees of water damage in both mountainous and plain areas. Before and after the heavy rain, the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued two urgent instructions in succession, requiring Party committees at all levels to take immediate action to fight the floods, with flood relief as the top priority in severely affected areas. Various counties also took emergency measures to mobilize the masses for rescue. During the rescue efforts, leaders at all levels personally went to the front lines to command, and cadres took the lead in the rescue. In Beiliu County, seven large and medium-sized reservoirs faced dangerous situations, but thanks to the leadership cadres at all levels who were stationed to direct operations, the situation has now been averted. In Guixian County, more than 62,000 people were mobilized in two days, rescuing more than 44,000 mu of rice and more than 8,400 mu of corn, while also repairing 28 mountain ponds and reservoirs. Currently, flood control work is still in full swing in various places.

    玉林专区抢救受淹农作物
    据广西日报消息　从12日晚间开始到15日，玉林专区普降暴雨，洪水暴发，山区平原都遭受不同程度的水灾。在暴雨前后，中共玉林地委连续发出两次紧急指示，要求各级党委立即行动，向水灾作斗争，水灾严重地区应以救灾为突出中心。各县也采取紧急措施，发动群众进行抢救。在抢救中，各级领导都亲临前线指挥，干部带头抢救。北流县有七个面临险局的大中型水库，由于各级领导干部坐镇指挥，目前已脱离险局。贵县两天内就出动了六万二千多人，抢救了水稻四万四千多亩，玉米八千四百多亩，同时还修好了山塘水库二十八处。目前，各地抗洪工作仍在大力进行中。
