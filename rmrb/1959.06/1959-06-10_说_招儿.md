Qi Qihar Peace Machinery Factory veteran worker Chen Dianwen said a thought-provoking passage at a meeting. He said, "We often feel 'scratching our heads' because the task is too heavy. What should we do? We will study together, everyone thinks of 'tricks', and whoever's 'trick' is good, we will use it. With 'tricks', everyone will study and experiment at the same time, and don't be discouraged by failure until it succeeds."

"Scratching your head" probably means "worrying," which is caused by difficulties and contradictions in work. In fact, any work will encounter difficulties and contradictions, some because the task is heavy, some because the work is unfamiliar, some because of insufficient equipment... Since things are developing forward, and old contradictions are overcome, new contradictions will naturally appear. This is not surprising, the question is how you treat it. Work is progressing in the continuous overcoming of contradictions, and we should also be like Chen Dianwen and them. When encountering difficulties, don't avoid it, but think hard, discuss more, and find a way to solve the problem.

"Tricks" cannot be thought out for no reason; they are often forced out because of difficulties. Some cadres encounter many difficult things, and complain that they are "bean cake cadres", being "squeezed from above and below" and "scratching their heads" a lot. In fact, the leadership "presses" you to make you tighten up your work, and the masses "squeeze" you to make you keep up with the work. In short, it is still the new work and new situation that are forcing you to think of ways to do a good job. Isn't Chen Dianwen's "trick" also forced out? He himself said that he was forced by the "task volume often exceeding several times the actual capacity of the equipment."

Can everyone who encounters "head-scratching" things force out "tricks"? Not necessarily. Some people encounter difficulties and just sigh and are frightened by the difficulties. The precious thing about Chen Dianwen is that he does not equate the meaning of the word "scratching your head" with the word "fear of difficulty", but regards it as the starting point of "solving difficulties", and then thinks of ways to solve the problem. In 1958, they produced the only large-scale nitrogen fertilizer equipment in the country. The power of the gantry planer was insufficient, which was a big difficulty. He gave himself a proposition: "What to do?" He pondered hard and studied constantly, and then conceived a method of "carp jumping over the dragon gate." In this way, one planer was used as four, tapping the potential and solving the problem of insufficient equipment. In April of this year, the pump seat of the high-pressure water pump was processed, and the width of the bed surface was not enough to process. This was also a difficulty. He came up with another "what to do?" and came up with a "trick" to set up a second false gantry, using a waste lathe as a gantry cross frame, and as a result, completed the task on time, with guaranteed quality and quantity.

"Tricks" also have good and bad points. The method thought out by one person deviating from reality and imagining things is by no means a good "trick". That would only be an evil trick, or an insubstantial trick. Chen Dianwen's "trick" is different. He neither blindly believes in old technology and equipment, nor blindly believes in his own "trick". Although he has many methods, he does not regard his methods as "unique tricks". He is good at studying with the workers in his group, everyone thinks of ways, and whoever's "trick" is good, he uses it. Therefore, his "trick" is formed by discarding his own unreasonable parts and absorbing the reasonable parts of other comrades to gather the wisdom of the masses. In this way, his "trick" is often correct or close to correct, and it is a "trick" that can hit the key of "head-scratching" things.

Because Chen Dianwen and them have the perseverance of "not being discouraged by failure, until success", the priceless treasure of "trick" can naturally shine in production through his hands.

    说“招儿”
    齐凡
    齐齐哈尔和平机器厂老工人陈殿文，在某个会上说了一段耐人寻味的话。他说：“我们往往因为任务过重感到‘挠头’，这怎么办？我们就一起研究，大家想‘招儿’，谁的‘招儿’好，就用谁的。有了‘招儿’，大家就一边研究，一边试验，失败也不灰心，直到成功为止。”
    “挠头”大概就是“伤脑筋”的意思吧，这是由工作中的困难和矛盾引起的。其实，干任何工作都会碰到困难和矛盾，有的是因为任务重了，有的是因为工作生疏，有的是因为设备不足……。既然事物是向前发展的，旧的矛盾克服了，自然还要出现新的矛盾，这一点也不奇怪，问题是看你怎么去对待它。工作就是在不断地克服矛盾中进展的，我们也应该像陈殿文他们那样，碰到困难，不要去回避它，而是苦苦思索，多多商量，找出解决问题的办法来。
    “招儿”并不是平白就能想出来的，它往往是因为碰到困难才逼出来。有的干部困难事碰得多了，就自怨自艾地说自己是“豆饼干部”，“上挤下压”“挠头”得很。其实领导“压”你一下，是让你把工作抓紧一些，群众
  “挤”你一下，是让你把工作跟上去，总而言之，还是新的工作和新的形势在逼着你，要你想出办法，把工作搞好。陈殿文的“招儿”又何尝不是逼出来的？他自己就说是被“任务量经常超过设备实有能力的几倍以上”逼的。
    是不是人人碰到“挠头”事都能逼出“招儿”来？不一定。有的人碰到困难，只是空自兴叹，被困难吓住了。陈殿文可贵之处就在于他不把“挠头”一词的含义和“畏难”一词等同起来，而是把它视为“排难”的出发点，进而去想办法解决问题。1958年他们生产全国仅有的大型氮肥设备，龙门刨床力量不足，这是个大困难，他就给自己出了个命题：“怎么办”？他苦苦思索，不断钻研，于是就孕育出来个“鲤鱼跳龙门”的办法。这样一台刨床就顶了四台刨床用，挖掘了潜力，解决了设备不足的问题。今年4月份加工高压水泵泵座，床面宽度不够，没法加工，这也是个困难，他又来了个“怎么办？”出了一个“招儿”，设了个第二道假龙门，用废车床作龙门横架，结果按期、保质、保量地完成了任务。
    “招儿”也有好坏之分，一人脱离实际异想天开地想出的办法，决不是好“招儿”。那只会是邪招儿，或者是不实在的花招儿。陈殿文的“招儿”不同，他既不迷信旧有的技术设备，也不迷信自己的“招儿”。虽然他的办法不少，可是他并不把自己的办法看作是“绝招儿”，他善于和他组内的工人一起研究，大家想办法，谁的“招儿”好，就用谁的。所以他的“招儿”是扬弃了自己不合理的部分，吸取了其他同志合理的部分集思广益而成的，这样，他的“招儿”就常是正确的或接近正确的，是能打中“挠头”事要害的“招儿”。
    由于陈殿文他们有那种“失败也不灰心，直到成功为止”的毅力，“招儿”这个无价之宝，自然就能通过他的手在生产上放出异采来。
