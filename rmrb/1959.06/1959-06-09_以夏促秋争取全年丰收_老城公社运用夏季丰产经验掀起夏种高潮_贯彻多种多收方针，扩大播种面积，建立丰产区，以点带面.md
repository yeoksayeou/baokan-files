Striving for a Full Harvest Throughout the Year by Capitalizing on Summer;
    Lao Cheng Commune Uses Summer Abundance Experience to Launch Summer Planting Climax;
    Implement the Policy of Multiple Planting and Multiple Harvesting, Expand Planting Area, Establish High-Yield Areas, and Use Points to Lead the Surface

    Zhengzhou, June 8th (Our Newspaper) - The Lao Cheng People's Commune in Yanshi County, Henan Province, accepting the experience of promoting large-scale abundance by establishing high-yield areas during the wheat season, is pressing ahead with its work. In the late autumn planting and early autumn management, they continue to combine high-yield production in high-yield areas with the policy of multiple planting and multiple harvesting. Currently, the commune has established a command headquarters for autumn field high-yield areas and has also assigned dedicated personnel to manage general fields, setting different high-yield requirements and measures for both high-yield and general fields. Using the experience of the wheat season to promote greater abundance in the autumn, they loudly proclaim "Red throughout the year with abundant harvests."
    When studying the autumn field high-yield plan, the Lao Cheng People's Commune Party Committee, based on the experience of the high-yield method during the wheat season, determined that the entire commune would plant 53,900 mu of late autumn crops. They designated 18,000 mu of fertile, flat land that could be fully irrigated by machinery or wells as high-yield areas for corn and millet. Out of 25,000 mu of cotton, they designated 3,700 mu of cotton fields to establish two cotton high-yield areas. Within the large-scale high-yield areas, 800 mu of grain and 61 mu of cotton were designated as high-yield demonstration plots, to allow small areas to lead larger areas and high-yield areas to drive general areas, achieving overall production increase.
    The combination of large-scale high-yield areas with general fields to comprehensively implement the policy of multiple planting for multiple harvests and the simultaneous pursuit of less planting for high yield and more harvesting, was clarified and developed after summarizing the experience of the high-yield method during the wheat season. During the summer, the Lao Cheng People's Commune achieved large-scale high yields on 6,000 mu of the 10,000 mu wheat high-yield area, exceeding the yield of general wheat by about twofold. At the same time, the high-yield area drove the surrounding general fields, promoting the entire high-yield movement. Such a large-scale high-yield area could only be achieved after collectivization, thus establishing faith in the high-yield area among the masses. Before the summer harvest and planting, various production brigades that were not originally within the high-yield area scope requested to expand the high-yield area scope and participate in the high-yield area. The commune Party committee studied the summer experience and believed that establishing high-yield areas to drive general fields, jointly planning, and jointly grasping measures, could both ensure high yields in high-yield fields and improve large-area production. This good method of leading the high-yield movement is the correct policy to guarantee increased grain production. Therefore, it was completely applied, from wheat to autumn grain, and from autumn grain to cotton.
    In order to implement this policy, the Lao Cheng Commune adopted six measures: (1) Assign leaders. Command headquarters were established for both grain and cotton, with two Party secretaries and one deputy secretary taking the lead, equipped with four Party committee members and three technical cadres. Each brigade also assigned dedicated personnel to lead the high-yield efforts. At the same time, the Party committee assigned one deputy secretary and four committee members to manage general fields. In terms of approach, the high-yield demonstration plots drove the high-yield areas, which in turn drove the general fields, to advance together. (2) Determine density and targets. Based on the different water and fertilizer conditions and management requirements of high-yield fields and general fields, realistic yield targets and planting requirements were determined. (3) Assign personnel and establish specialized teams. High-yield areas and general fields were managed separately but supported and cooperated with each other. Regarding labor allocation, approximately 40% was focused on high-yield areas and 60% on large fields. Both high-yield areas and general fields established responsibility systems, with leadership at every level from cadres to commune members, fixed quotas for each area from planting to harvesting, and all-inclusive responsibility.
  (4) Determine machinery. Most of the 18,000 mu of autumn grain high-yield area was plowed by tractors, with deep plowing of eight inches or more. All twenty-three water-lifting irrigation machines were fixed in the high-yield area to ensure three to five irrigations. When dry land in general fields could not be irrigated or resist drought, the high-yield area could transfer labor to provide support. (5) Determine fertilizer. Following the principle of prioritizing high-yield areas and then general fields, while considering both, (6) Determine crop areas. Based on soil conditions, high-yield areas were designated to plant more millet and corn, while general fields planted more drought-resistant cotton and some beans.
    When implementing the policy of simultaneously pursuing multiple planting for multiple harvests and less planting for high yield and more harvesting, the Lao Cheng People's Commune faced resistance. For example, while vigorously promoting high-yield areas, some cadres and masses developed one-sided views. They believed that "planting more is not as good as planting less, planting less is not as good as planting well," and that "planting too much in the summer would lead to water and fertilizer shortages and overburdened labor, resulting in a poor wheat harvest next year," and other such arguments. Therefore, some brigades planned to reduce the area of summer planting after wheat to about 60%. The commune Party committee promptly used accounting methods to educate cadres and the masses, explaining that under the current production conditions, only by simultaneously promoting both high-yield areas and large-scale production through multiple planting could they guarantee more grain. As long as labor was properly arranged between high-yield areas and general fields, it could also be managed effectively. After careful accounting and analysis, the Sigou Production Brigade found that one mu of upland could yield 350 jin of Daihan wheat in one season, while wheat stubble could yield 250 to 300 jin of wheat, and millet planted after wheat could yield 200 to 250 jin, resulting in a total yield of 450 to 500 jin for two crops in one season. More planting could produce more grain and more straw. After careful accounting, the brigade increased its area of summer planting after wheat to 80%. Thus, after specifically arranging measures for high-yield areas and general fields, the entire commune planned to plant 53,900 mu of summer crops after wheat out of a total of 71,000 mu of wheat fields, accounting for 75% of the summer harvest area.
    Now, inspired by the summer's abundant harvest, the commune members of the Lao Cheng People's Commune are highly enthusiastic about production. Cotton in the high-yield areas has been weeded three times and treated for pests three times, while cotton in general fields has been weeded twice and treated for pests twice, and is growing vigorously. The late autumn planting is proceeding according to the requirements of "plow and seed immediately after harvesting, plant enough seedlings, plant early and well, and ensure that all seedlings emerge." The land where wheat has been harvested is plowed flat, the ridges are evenly sized, late autumn seeds have been sown, and the land is irrigated thoroughly. The corn seedlings planted in the wheat stubble have already grown two inches high. (Zhang Lizhong)

    以夏促秋争取全年丰收
    老城公社运用夏季丰产经验掀起夏种高潮
    贯彻多种多收方针，扩大播种面积，建立丰产区，以点带面
    本报郑州8日电　河南偃师县老城人民公社，接受麦季搞丰产区带动大面积丰产的经验，乘胜前进，在晚秋播种和早秋管理工作中，继续大搞丰产区高额丰产和多种多收相结合的丰产运动。现在，这个公社已经成立了秋田丰产区指挥部，同时也确定了专人抓一般田，订出丰产和一般田的不同丰产要求和丰产措施。以麦季的丰产经验推动秋季更大丰产，响亮地提出了“丰产全年红”。
    老城人民公社党委会在研究秋田丰产计划的时候，根据麦季搞丰产方的经验，确定全公社种晚秋作物五万三千九百亩，将土壤肥沃，地势平坦，全部能够机灌、井灌的一万八千亩地划为玉米和谷子丰产区；在二万五千亩棉花中，划出三千七百亩棉田，搞了两个棉花丰产区。在大搞丰产区中，又有八百亩粮食、六十一亩棉花为高额丰产指挥田，以便小区带大区、丰产区带动一般区，达到全面增产。
    大搞丰产区和一般田相结合，完整地贯彻执行多种多收和少种高产多收同时并举的方针，是通过麦季实践，总结了麦季搞丰产方的经验之后，明确和发展起来的。老城人民公社夏季在万亩小麦丰产区的六千亩土地上，获得了大面积高额丰产，比一般麦子高出一倍左右；同时丰产区带动了周围的一般田，推动了整个丰产运动。这样大面积的丰产区，只有在公社化以后，才有条件、有力量搞，因而，丰产区在群众中树立了信仰。夏收夏播之前，原来不在丰产区范围的各个大队，纷纷要求扩大丰产区范围，参加丰产区。公社党委研究了夏季的经验，认为搞丰产区带动一般田，共同计划共同抓措施，既可使丰产田获得高额丰产，又能搞好大面积丰产，这种领导丰产运动的良好方法，是保证增产粮食的正确方针。于是，从小麦推广到秋粮，从秋粮推广到棉花，完整地运用起来。
    为了使这一方针贯彻执行，老城公社采取了六项措施：（1）定领导。粮食和棉花都建立指挥部，确定了两个党委书记和一个副书记挂帅，并配备了四个党委委员和三个技术干部，各大队也确定了专人领导丰产方。同时，党委并确定一个党委副书记、四个党委委员抓一般田。在抓法上是高额丰产指挥田带动丰产区，丰产区带动一般田，共同前进。（2）定密度、定指标。根据丰产田和一般田不同的水、肥条件和管理要求，定出切合实际的产量指标和种植要求。（3）定人员，建立专业队。丰产区和一般田分别管理，但又互相支援协作，丰产区和一般田的劳力使用，大体上是40％在丰产方，60％的劳力抓大田。丰产区和一般田都建立了责任制，从干部到社员，从种到收，层层有领导，块块有定额，一包到底。
  （4）定机器。秋粮丰产区的一万八千亩土地，大部用拖拉机耕地，深耕八寸以上，二十三部提水灌溉机器，全部固定在丰产区，保证浇三遍至五遍。一般田旱地，无法浇水、抗旱时，丰产区可以调劳动力支援。（5）定肥料。本着先丰产区后一般田，丰产田与一般田兼顾的原则。（6）定作物区。根据土壤情况，丰产地确定多种谷子、玉米，一般田多种些抗旱的棉花，还种了一些豆类。
    老城人民公社在贯彻多种多收和少种高产多收同时并举方针的时候，是有阻力的。如在大搞丰产区的同时，在一部分干部和群众中，产生了片面的看法。他们认为“种多不如种少，种少不如种好”，“夏播的多了，缺水、缺肥、劳力顾不过来，来年的麦子收成差”等论调。因此，有的大队打算把麦茬夏播面积缩小到60％左右。公社党委及时用算账的方法，教育干部和群众，说明在目前的生产条件下，只有将高额丰产区和多种多收的大面积增产同时搞好，才能保证多打粮食；而劳力只要丰产区和一般田安排好，也是可以搞好的。寺沟生产大队经过算账分析，一亩岭地一年种一季岱旱麦，可以收三百五十斤，而谷茬麦子亩收二百五十到三百斤，麦茬谷子又可以收二百斤到二百五十斤，一季种两茬能收四百五十斤到五百斤。多种能够多打粮食，又能多收草，经过仔细算账，这个大队将麦茬夏播面积提高80％。这样全公社在具体安排丰产区和一般田的措施以后，全公社七万一千多亩麦田，计划夏播五万三千九百亩，占夏收面积的75％。
    现在，老城人民公社的社员们，在夏季大丰产的鼓舞下，生产情绪高涨。丰产区的棉花已锄过三遍草，治过三遍虫，一般棉田也锄过两遍草，治过两遍虫，生长得茁壮旺盛。晚秋的播种正本着“随收随犁苗种足，种早种好苗出齐”的要求进行。在收割了麦子的土地上，犁整的平坦，畦打的一般大小，播下了晚秋的种子，水浇的滋润润的，大麦茬的玉米已长出二寸多高的嫩苗。　（张励中）
