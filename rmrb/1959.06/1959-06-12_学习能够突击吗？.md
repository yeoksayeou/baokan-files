Title: Can Learning Be Crammed?

Many people may have the experience of burning the midnight oil during their school life. This is a cramming approach to learning. After cramming, it is possible to get better grades, but after a few days, the knowledge just learned will be forgotten. There are also people who, after cramming, still cannot get good grades, which is due to excessive fatigue, making them dizzy. Since it is cramming, one has to memorize by rote. Many people may also have this experience: for a certain subject or formula, if you pay attention to it usually and understand it comprehensively, it is very easy to remember; if you don't pay attention to it usually and don't understand it comprehensively, rote memorization is like "nailing steel nails on a bluestone slab," incompatible. Therefore, rote memorization cannot solve the problem. "Not burning incense at ordinary times, but embracing Buddha's feet temporarily" violates the laws of learning and is a manifestation of not diligently studying knowledge.

Knowledge is systematic and must be digested step by step, progressing gradually in order to be consolidated. There is an ancient Chinese story that a person planted a sapling and went to see if it had grown every day. He saw that it was growing slowly, so he pulled it out a bit. He thought this would make the sapling grow taller, but the sapling withered. This is "helping the seedlings grow by pulling them up," haste makes waste. Learning is like planting seedlings; it must be carried out according to the laws of learning. The process by which a person acquires knowledge has certain laws. That is, from perceptual to rational, from partial to whole, and it must be integrated and truly digested by oneself. If the old knowledge is not deeply remembered, the new knowledge will not be easily consolidated. Just as if a linear equation with one variable has not been solved well, one goes to solve a quadratic equation with two variables, or a multivariable equation, even if one reluctantly learns it, it cannot be consolidated. Quality problems will occur in construction projects during crash programs, and what problems will occur in learning crash programs are also conceivable. The Song Dynasty poet Fan Chengda said, "Scholarly strength rooted deeply is firmly established." To achieve deep-rooted scholarship, it is impossible to achieve results by relying solely on a short period of cramming.

Then, can learning only be done slowly? No, it can't. Young people should strive for advancement and progress faster. Progressing faster does not mean cramming, but should be based on daily efforts. In Chinese terms, it is necessary to "persevere," which is the most reliable. But this does not mean taking it slowly. The socialist construction of the motherland requires young students to be proficient in their studies and does not allow them to take it slowly. A veteran in the theatrical circle once said, "Slow should be relaxed, tight should be tense, not slow and not tight is the real skill!" For learning, one must also put in such effort. Such effort is true skill, and it is also the most difficult skill. Therefore, it is impossible to carry out so-called "high-yield ten-day periods," "high-yield weeks," and "leap-forward days" in learning as in production. We hope that young students can devote the spirit and courage of cramming to more detailed and solid learning.

    学习能够突击吗？
    张罗
    许多人都可能有在学校生活中开夜车的经验。这是一种学习上的突击。经过突击，有可能获得比较好的成绩，但是，过了几天以后，刚学习到的知识就会忘掉了。也有的人经过突击，仍然不能获得好的成绩，那就是由于过度疲劳，弄得晕头晕脑。既然是突击，就得硬记。许多人也可能有这个经验，对于某一个课题或者公式，要是平常留心，全面理解了，就非常容易记住；要是平常不留心，没有全面理解，硬记就如同“青石板上钉钢钉”一样，格格不入。所以，硬记是解决不了问题的。“平时不烧香，临时抱佛脚”，这是违反学习的规律，不老老实实地钻研学问的表现。
    知识是有系统性的，必须消化一步，再进一步，循序渐进，才能巩固。我国古时有个故事说，有个人种了一棵树苗，天天去看它长了没有。他看它长的慢，就拔出来一些。他认为这样就能够使树苗长高，结果树苗却枯萎了。这就是
  “揠苗助长”，欲速则不达。学习同种树苗的情况一样，一定要按照学习的规律进行。一个人获得知识的过程，是有一定规律的。那就是，由感性到理性，由部分到全体，而且要经过自己融会贯通，真正消化。旧的记不深，新的也就不容易巩固。正如一元一次方程式没有解好，就去解二元二次方程式，或是多元方程式，即使勉强学会了，也巩固不下来。建筑工程在突击中会发生质量问题，在学习的突击中会发生什么问题也是可想而知的。宋诗人范成大说，“学力根深方蒂固”，要做到学问根深蒂固，光靠一个短时期的突击，是不可能奏效的。
    那末，学习是不是只能慢慢来呢？也不能。青年应当争取先进，争取进步得更快些。进步得快些，并不是要突击，而应当建立在日常努力的基础上。用我国的古话来说，就是要“持之有恒”，这是最可靠的。但这并不等于说要慢慢来。祖国社会主义建设要求青年学生要学业精进，不允许慢慢来。一个戏剧界的前辈说过，“慢要松，紧要崩，不慢不紧才是功！”对于学习来说，也要下这样的功夫。这样的功夫才是真功夫，也是最难的功夫。所以，在学习上是不可能同生产上那样，开展所谓“高产旬”、“高产周”、“跃进日”的。我们希望青年学生能够把突击的精神和勇气，花到更细致踏实的学习中去。
