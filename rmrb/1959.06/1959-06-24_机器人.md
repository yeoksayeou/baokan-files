Robot
American Worker Poet John Grasser

Before dawn on Monday, I got up and went to the factory, following the old path, a path I’ve walked a thousand times.
The chimneys still belch smoke, but no one is by the machines,
The blackened workshop is empty, Jack and John are nowhere to be seen.
Everywhere machines roar, a low and monotonous sound fills the shop,
Lights, buttons and electric bells, little things sparkle everywhere.
I shout, "Answer me quickly! Where are John and Jack?"
The signal light answers, the whistle drowns out my words.
Confused and bewildered, I rush to the foreman to ask,
Anxious and angry, I ask, "What happened to them?"
The foreman glares with eyes that constantly change color,
First red, then blue, then white flashes like lightning.
Then the foreman is gone, replaced by a robot in his seat,
Like a clay statue, repulsive, with a cold and indifferent face.
The robot speaks with an iron throat:
"They are no longer useful!"
Then the bell rings, the gate opens, and everything becomes clear.
The robot smiles, and says bluntly:
"You are no longer needed here, young man, get out of here!"

    机器人
    美国工人诗人　约翰·格莱塞星期一天还没亮，爬起来就上工厂，顺着老路往前走，此路已走千百趟。烟筒照样冒着烟，机器旁边人不见，熏黑的车间空荡荡，看不到杰克和约翰。到处机器轰轰响，低沉单调满车间，电灯、电钮和电铃，小东西到处光闪闪。我大喊一声“快回答！约翰和杰克都在哪？”回答的是信号灯，汽笛吞没我的话。我惊慌失措搞不清，忙去找工长问分明，又急又气我开口问：“他们出了什么事情？”只见工长瞪着两眼，两眼的颜色时刻变，一会儿红来一会儿蓝，一会儿是白光像闪电。原来工长已无踪影，座位上坐个机器人，像座泥胎讨人厌，面孔冷淡又无情。答话放开铁喉咙：
  “他们早已不中用！”这时铃响大门开，事情马上就分明。只见机器人笑着脸，直截了当地开了言：
  “这里已经不需要你，小伙子给我快滚蛋！”（原载美国“工会新闻”）
