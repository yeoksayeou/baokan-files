Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 12th June: Anhui Province is actively taking measures to ensure the completion of the sowing plan for oil crops.

Various regions have adjusted their summer planting plans, adopting methods such as intercropping, mixed planting, and utilizing vacant land to plant oil crops on a large scale. The CPC Liu'an County Committee convened a meeting of the first secretaries of district and township party committees in late May and decided to further increase the planting area of oil crops on the basis of the already planted 100,500 mu of spring peanuts. The approach is to plant another 60,000 mu of wheat stubble peanuts, intercrop sesame on all 230,000 mu of sweet potatoes, cotton, and spring peanuts, and expand sesame planting by 10,000 mu using scattered vacant land. Both sides of the Pi-Shi irrigation canal will be fully utilized to plant peanuts and sesame. Huoshan County originally planned to plant 2,500 mu of sesame, but now it has been decided to fully utilize vacant land and intercrop in sweet potato, peanut, and corn fields to expand the sesame planting area to 6,000 mu.

All parts of Anhui Province attach great importance to the sowing quality of oil crops and strive for timely sowing. Yangding Commune in Lingbi County extracted more than 1,800 members with soybean planting experience to form 77 professional teams to be specifically responsible for soybean sowing. The 30,000 mu of soybeans sown by the commune were generally tilled two to three times, harrowed five to seven times, deep ploughed to a depth of about seven inches, formed into ridge fields, and applied more than 500 dan of basal fertilizer per mu. All seeds used were improved varieties. Dingji Commune in Liu'an County organized 103 oil crop sowing professional teams. They transported fertilizer at night and prepared the land and sowed during the day, rushing to plant more than 3,100 mu of wheat stubble peanuts in seven days, and intercropped and single-planted sesame on more than 1,800 mu of spring peanut fields and 108 mu of small vacant plots.

While rushing to sow, various regions are also strengthening field management of already planted oil crops. The Party Secretary and three Party Committee members of the Huayuan Commune in Fengyang County divided up the peanut field management work, and each production team organized professional teams to specifically manage the peanut fields. The commune also centrally trained 30 technicians to be specifically responsible for technical guidance for peanut field management.

At present, the sowing work of oil crops in various parts of Anhui is still actively underway. It is estimated that peanut sowing can be completed before mid-June and soybean sowing can be completed before the summer solstice.

### 麦茬地种花生　棉田套种芝麻  安徽想方设法多种油料

    麦茬地种花生　棉田套种芝麻
    安徽想方设法多种油料
    新华社合肥12日电　安徽各地积极采取措施，保证完成油料作物的播种计划。
    各地都调整了夏种计划，采用套种、间种、利用空隙地等办法大量种植油料作物。中共六安县委在5月下旬召开了区乡党委第一书记会议，决定在已种十万零五千亩春花生的基础上，再增加油料作物的播种面积，办法是再种六万亩麦茬花生；在二十三万亩山芋、棉花、春种花生地上全部套种、间种芝麻；利用零星空地扩种芝麻一万亩；淠农灌溉渠两旁全部利用起来种花生、芝麻。霍山县原来计划种芝麻二千五百亩，现在决定充分利用空隙地和在山芋、花生、玉米等地里间种，把芝麻播种面积扩大到六千亩。
    安徽省各地都很重视油料作物的播种质量，并且力争下种适时。灵壁县杨町公社抽出一千八百多个有种植大豆经验的社员，组成七十七个专业队，专门负责大豆播种。全社播种的三万亩大豆，一般都耕两遍到三遍，耙五遍到七遍，深耕七寸左右，做成畦田，每亩施基肥五百担以上，种子全部选用了良种。六安县丁集公社组织了一百零三个油料作物播种专业队，他们晚上送肥，白天整地播种，七天内抢种麦茬花生三千一百多亩，并且在一千八百多亩春花生地和一百零八亩小块空隙地上套种和单种了芝麻。
    各地一面抢种，一面对已种的油料作物加强田间管理。凤阳县花园公社党委书记和三个党委委员分片领导花生田间管理工作，各生产队都组织了专业队专管花生田。全社还集中训练了三十个技术员，具体负责花生田间管理的技术指导工作。
    目前，安徽各地的油料作物播种工作仍在积极进行，预计花生在6月中旬以前、大豆在夏至以前可播种结束。
