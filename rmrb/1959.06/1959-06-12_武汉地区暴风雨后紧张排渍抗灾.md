Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 11th: The Wuhan area was suddenly hit by a rainstorm from 5:00 PM on the 8th to 7:00 AM on the 9th. Rainfall reached over 250 millimeters in just over ten hours, causing widespread flooding, an event unseen in forty years. The nearby Huangpi and Wuchang counties also experienced rainfall of over 100 millimeters overnight. According to initial statistics from Echeng, Yunmeng, and Huangpi counties, over 200,000 mu of cotton, paddy fields, and autumn miscellaneous grains were affected by the flooding.

Currently, tens of thousands of laborers in various counties are battling the disaster caused by the rainstorm, simultaneously draining floodwaters, preventing waterlogging, and washing and replanting seedlings. On the 9th, Echeng County mobilized 60,000 people to rescue 25,000 mu of flooded rice paddies, draining the water from 18,000 mu that same day. The more than 3,000 mu of rice fields in the Taihu Commune that suffered from waterlogging were immediately engaged in seedling support and washing after the water was drained. By noon on the 9th, over 20,000 mu of autumn crops in Yunmeng County had been drained of floodwaters, and Huangpi County had rescued 89,000 mu of waterlogged early rice fields.

People's communes in the severely flooded suburban areas of Wuhan have established flood drainage and disaster relief headquarters, concentrating a large number of water pumps to drain water day and night. Communes are also expanding new vegetable gardens in higher-lying areas and rushing to plant quick-growing vegetables to compensate for the loss of vegetables.

    武汉地区暴风雨后紧张排渍抗灾
    据新华社武汉11日电　武汉地区从8日下午五时到9日清晨七时，突遭暴风雨袭击，十多个小时内降雨量达二百五十多公厘，许多地区渍水盈尺，是四十年来所未有的现象。附近的黄陂、武昌等县一夜之间也降雨一百多公厘。据鄂城、云梦、黄陂三县初步统计，受渍的棉花、稻田和秋杂粮共有二十万多亩。
    现在，各县数以万计的劳动大军正在跟暴雨所造成的灾害作斗争，一面排渍防涝，一面洗苗补栽。鄂城县在9日出动了六万人，抢救被水淹了的二万五千亩水稻，当天就有一万八千亩排除了渍水。太湖公社遭到涝害的三千多亩稻田，在排出渍水后，马上又进行了扶苗洗苗。到9日中午，云梦县被淹的秋收作物已有两万多亩排出了渍水；黄陂县救出了受渍的早稻田八万九千亩。
    受渍严重的武汉市郊区各人民公社，都成立了排渍抗灾指挥部，集中了大批抽水机，日夜不停地排水。各公社还在地势较高的地区扩大新菜园，抢种快熟蔬菜，以弥补蔬菜的损失。
