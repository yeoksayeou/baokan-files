World Travelers Yearn for Summer in Moscow

Moscow's summer life has begun. The scenic, cool and pleasant summer in Moscow makes the prosperity and beauty of Moscow particularly prominent. Moscow's summer attracts travelers from all corners of the globe. They have already begun to flock to the capital of this great socialist country in batches.

Peace trains and friendship trains are speeding to Moscow, and airplanes are carrying people from the most distant regions to Moscow every few minutes. Direct trains from Moscow go to Beijing, Warsaw, Berlin, Sofia, Budapest, Bucharest, Helsinki, Vienna, and will soon go directly to Paris and Rome. Every day, direct flights come from the capitals of countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. For a long time, Moscow has been a world city and a center of international activity, but Moscow's connection with the world has never been as close and convenient as it is today. Comprehensive communist construction, the seven-year plan, artificial satellites, cosmic rockets... these new era things attract the attention of people all over the world, and more and more people are paying attention to the Soviet Union and Moscow. Today, Moscow has become a city attracting worldwide attention.

How many delegations and travelers come to Moscow every day for sightseeing, tours, research, and study? Just as travelers, there have been 1.6 million people from more than 90 countries who have come to Moscow since 1956. There were 560,000 in 1957, and it increased to 740,000 in 1958. It is expected that there will be many more this year. Whether it is a socialist country, a nationalist country, or a capitalist country, the number of people who yearn for Moscow has greatly increased.

Summer in Moscow welcomes guests from all over the world. The people of Moscow are hospitable, their eyes are kind and careful, and their faces are happy and radiant. Not only every Muscovite, but also the entire appearance of Moscow reveals pleasant and attractive colors. Unlike many European cities with too many gray buildings, every building in Moscow is bright, and shines in the summer sun. The buildings in Moscow, which are extending to the suburbs day by day, the countless cranes stretching their giant arms, and the large new-style residences in the southwest district that can accommodate 200,000 people, immediately grab the mood of the visitors heading to the city center. Whether it is a noble government delegation or an extremely ordinary traveler, they cannot help but marvel at the speed of Moscow's construction and changes when they see these scenes!

Moscow itself is a tourist attraction. The city's museums, exhibitions, parks, and historical sites alone can provide tourists with several days of sightseeing. If you are an art lover, then summer in Moscow reveals the essence of art to you. Thirty or forty theaters, music halls, and open-air music venues are filled with music and new dramas are being staged. If you love Russian literature, then in this city full of greenery and memorial statues, you can find the former residences of writers everywhere. If you want to recall the past events of the revolution, then Moscow itself is a rich revolutionary history. There are more than 100 places here connected with the name of the great Lenin, and there are the old sites and battlefields of the three revolutionary struggles in 1905 and 1917. These areas have been carefully preserved for tourists to visit and study for thousands of years.

Moscow is not only a tourist attraction, but also a treasure of culture and technology, a collection of scientific knowledge, and a center of the new era. Not only tourists and travelers, but also scientists, technologists, industrialists, businessmen, scholars, and young people are coming to Moscow more and more. In the 1960s, if people want to seek friendship and trade, seek technology and knowledge, seek ideals and experience, there is no place more suitable than Moscow.

A new world is growing, and a new generation is growing up. The new generation needs to be inspired and nourished. Moscow is such a suitable place, so young people from all over the world come one after another, not only for short-term tours, but also for long-term study. There are 14,000 students from all over the world who come to the Soviet Union to study, most of whom are concentrated in Moscow. Moscow University alone has more than 2,000 young people from dozens of countries. Every summer, batches of young people come to Moscow, and when they first bathe in the sunny summer of Moscow, their happy mood is also uplifted.

White-haired scientists also come to Moscow. In this era, whether it is to obtain knowledge of artificial satellites and space flight, or to obtain knowledge in medical and industrial production, there is a city that must be visited, and that is Moscow. Throughout the year, especially in the beautiful summer, various delegations are sent to Moscow from the most distant corners of the earth. The number of delegations is increasing year by year. In the two years of 1956 and 1957 alone, more than 2,200 delegations from 89 countries came to Moscow. The number in 1958 and 1959 will be much higher. Many international scientific conferences are also held in Moscow throughout the year.

More and more artists are also coming to Moscow, on the one hand to perform their art, and on the other hand to learn from the achievements of the new era of art of the great Soviet people. Performances from all over the world in Moscow almost never stop throughout the year, and summer is especially a peak season. The Guangdong Music Troupe from China recently gave a wonderful performance here; now acrobatics from Sweden in Northern Europe, pianists from Hungary on the Danube River, and bands from the German Democratic Republic are performing. They regard being welcomed by Muscovites as a lofty honor.

Moscow has many international friendship and cultural exchange centers. The Academy of Sciences on Kaluga Street is a place that many world-renowned people must visit. This building, located in the shade of gardens, is not only the command post of Soviet science, but also a place admired by the world's scientific community. Walking forward from here, the magnificent building of Moscow University on Lenin Hills with 32 floors provides excellent conference venues for world scientific conferences and provides a source of knowledge for those seeking knowledge. A few years ago, this was still a suburb far from the city center, but now, the subway has been extended here, and a prosperous urban area has appeared around it, and the surrounding flower beds and trees have grown up. The National Economic Construction Achievement Exhibition in the northern suburbs covers an area of ​​more than 200 hectares, and nearly 100 exhibition halls are all open and exquisite. Here, you can see atomic power stations, electronic machines, rockets, artificial satellites, and thermonuclear energy devices. Here, foreign visitors and Moscow residents watch the mysteries of the universe and the achievements of mankind concentrated in the exhibition.

No matter what kind of professional you are, no matter what kind of achievement you love and are fascinated by, you can always find a place to go in Moscow. And you will also find that you should not only go for a few hours or once or twice, but should stay longer. But even if you take a quick look at Moscow, you will see how the torrent of progress and prosperous life is surging forward day and night.

Summer in Moscow seems to have no night. The sky is still very bright at ten o'clock in the evening, and the morning glow rises again at two o'clock in the morning. Such a beautiful tourist season attracts more people to yearn for Moscow.

    世界旅客向往的夏季莫斯科
    莫斯科的夏季生活开始了。风光明媚，凉爽宜人的莫斯科的夏天，使莫斯科的繁荣生活和美丽景色显得特别突出。莫斯科的夏日吸引着全球各个角落的旅客。他们已经开始一批批地涌向这个伟大社会主义国家的首都来了。
    一列列的和平列车、友谊列车驰向莫斯科，每隔几分钟一架的飞机把人们从最辽远的地区载来莫斯科。直达列车从莫斯科通向北京、华沙、柏林、索非亚、布达佩斯、布加勒斯特、赫尔辛基、维也纳，并且即将直通巴黎和罗马。每天都有直航飞机从亚、欧、非三洲各国首都来到。很久以来，莫斯科就是一个世界的都市，就是一个国际性活动的中心，但莫斯科和全球的联系，从来还没有像今天这样的密切方便。全面共产主义建设、七年远景计划、人造卫星、宇宙火箭……这些新时代的事物，吸引着全世界人们的目光，越来越多的人注视着苏联，注视着莫斯科。今天，莫斯科已经成为万方瞩目的城市了。
    每天到底有多少代表团、多少旅行者来到莫斯科观光、游览、研究和学习呢？单是以旅行者的身份来到莫斯科的，从1956年到现在就有九十多个国家的一百六十万人，1957年是五十六万，1958年就增加到七十四万，今年预料将更多得多。无论是社会主义国家，还是民族主义国家，或者是资本主义国家，向往莫斯科的人是大大增加了。
    夏日的莫斯科欢迎来自世界各地的客人。莫斯科人殷勤好客，他们的目光是亲切仔细的，面容是愉快焕发的。不仅每个莫斯科人，而且整个莫斯科的容貌都显露出愉快引人的色彩。不像欧洲许多城市灰色的建筑过多，莫斯科的每一幢建筑都是明亮的，在夏日的照耀下，容光焕发。莫斯科逐日伸向四郊的建筑，那无数伸着巨臂的起重机，那能容二十万人的西南区的大片新式住宅，一下子就攫住了向市中心区进发的来客的心情。无论是高贵的政府代表团，或一个极其普通的旅客，一看到这些景象都不能不惊叹：莫斯科建设和变化的速度是太快了！
    莫斯科本身就是一个游览的胜地。单是全市的博物馆、展览会、公园、历史遗迹就可以供游人几日的观光。如果你是艺术的爱好者，那么夏季的莫斯科向你袒露了整个艺术的精华。三、四十家剧院、音乐厅、露天音乐场，到处乐声飘扬，新剧上演。如果你热爱俄罗斯的文学，那么这个满城绿荫和纪念像遍立的城市，到处可以寻到文学家们的故居旧地。如果你要想追怀当年革命的往事，那么莫斯科本身就是一部丰富的革命历史。这里有一百多处地方和伟大列宁的名字联系在一起，这里有1905年、1917年三次革命斗争的旧址和战斗场所。这些地区都珍重地保存了起来，供旅客游人千秋万代观赏和研究。
    莫斯科还不仅是一个游览胜地，而且是一个文化技术的宝藏、科学知识的总汇、新时代的中心。不仅游人和旅行者，而且科学技术家、工商业家、学者、青年也都纷纷地越来越多地来到莫斯科。在二十世纪六十年代，人们要寻求友谊和贸易，寻求技术和知识，寻求理想和经验，没有比莫斯科更合适的了。
    新的世界在生长，新的一代在成长。新的一代人们需要得到启发和营养。莫斯科正是这样一个合适的地方，因此全世界各国的青年就接连来到，不仅来短时游览，而且长期学习。有一万四千名学生从世界各地来苏联求学，其中大部分又集中在莫斯科。仅莫斯科大学就有来自几十个国家的二千多个青年。每年夏天一批批的青年来到莫斯科，当他们第一次浴着莫斯科夏日的晴阳时，他们的满怀幸福的心情也不禁为之昂扬起来了。
    白发苍苍的科学家们也来到莫斯科。在这个时代，不管是要获得人造卫星和宇宙飞行的知识也好，要获得医疗方面和工业生产方面的知识也好，有一个不能不去的城市，这就是莫斯科。一年之中，特别是美好的夏日，从地球最辽远的角落都派出了各式各样的代表团到来莫斯科。代表团的数目与年俱增。1956年和1957年两年内，就有二千二百多个来自八十九个国家的代表团来过莫斯科。1958年和1959年的数目还要大大超过。一年之中还有许多国际性的科学会议在莫斯科举行。
    越来越多的艺术家也来到莫斯科，一方面献演自己的艺术，同时也就向伟大苏联人民学习新时代艺术的成就。莫斯科一年之中从全球各地来的艺术表演，几乎没有间断过，而且夏天尤其是一个盛季。来自中国的广东音乐团不久前在这里进行了美妙的演出；现在来自北欧瑞典的杂技，来自多瑙河畔匈牙利的钢琴家和来自德意志民主共和国的乐队正在表演，他们以得到莫斯科人的欢迎作为崇高的荣誉。
    莫斯科有许多国际友谊和文化交流的中心。卡卢加大街上的科学院是许多世界著名人士都要来拜访的地方。这个座落在花园浓荫里的建筑不仅是苏联科学的指挥部，而且也是世界科学界景仰的地方。从这里向前走去，列宁山上三十二层的莫斯科大学的辉煌大厦，给世界性的科学会议提供了优良的会议场所，给寻找知识的人们提供了获得知识的源泉。几年前，这里还是离市中心较远的郊区，而现在，地下铁道已通到了这里，周围已出现了一片繁盛的市区，四周培植的花圃和林荫都已成长起来了。北郊的国民经济建设成就展览会占地两百多公顷，里面近百个展览馆全部开放，精美绝伦。在这里，原子能电站、电子机器、火箭、人造卫星、热核能装置都可以看到。在这里，外国来的人士和莫斯科的居民一道观看集中展览的宇宙的奥秘和人类的成就。
    无论你是哪种专业的人士，无论你热爱和醉心于哪种成就，你总可以在莫斯科找到应该去的地方。你并且还会发现你不应只去几小时或一两次，而应该逗留更多的时间。但即使匆匆一瞥莫斯科，你也会看到进步和繁荣的生活巨流是在怎样日夜不息地向前奔涌。
    夏日的莫斯科几乎是没有黑夜似的，晚上十点天空还很明亮，早上两点多钟朝霞又升起了。这样美丽的游览季节，吸引着更多的人心向往着莫斯科。
