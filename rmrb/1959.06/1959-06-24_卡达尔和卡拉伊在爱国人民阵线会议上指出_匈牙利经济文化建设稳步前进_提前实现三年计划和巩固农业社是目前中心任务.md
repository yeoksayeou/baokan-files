Xinhua News Agency, Budapest. The National Council of the Hungarian Patriotic People's Front held a meeting on the 19th. At the meeting, Karoly, member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, secretary of the Central Committee, and chairman of the National Council of the Patriotic People's Front, delivered a report on the current political, economic, and cultural issues in Hungary.

In his report, Kallai spoke of the unity between the Hungarian people and the Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, the victory of socialist ideology in Hungary, and the achievements of Hungary's economic construction. He said that in the first five months of this year, the total output value of Hungary's state-owned industry increased by 7% to 8% compared with the same period last year.

Kallai pointed out that Hungary's agricultural products are expected to have a good harvest this year. Consolidating the newly established agricultural production cooperatives remains a very important task. To this end, the Hungarian working class and the government will vigorously help the newly established agricultural production cooperatives.

Kallai pointed out that the socialist revolution on Hungary's cultural front is also developing effectively. The influence of the Party's ideology in the field of cultural life has been strengthened, and the ranks of Party members and non-Party intellectuals loyal to socialism have been expanded. Hungary's literature and art have undertaken the task of conducting socialist education for the masses. Kallai then pointed out that an important factor for the continued development of Hungary's cultural life is to strengthen the direct ties between literary and art workers and workers and peasants.

Janos Kadar, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, also spoke at the meeting.

He pointed out that the current central tasks of the Party and the people are to implement the resolution put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee in March to complete the main targets of the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule and to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives.

Kadar said that the Party Central Committee's March resolution represents the interests of the entire people. In order to implement this resolution, the broad masses of working people have put forward specific guarantees. Judging from the current achievements, they have fulfilled their promises and may overfulfill the original plan. He emphasized that the essence of our policy line is to continue to build and complete socialism, and to enter communism in the future. This point will never change. The Party Congress to be held at the end of this year will further strengthen this line.

Speaking of the agricultural collectivization movement, Kadar said that this issue is related to the development of the entire society and the future of the nation, and we must build a modern socialist agriculture. He pointed out that the primary determinant of the development of the collectivization movement is political conditions. Kadar criticized the view that overemphasizes economic conditions, advocating that economic conditions for organizing agricultural production cooperatives should be created first, and then cooperatives can be established. He said that the peasants know that even if the state does not give them a single sickle, the collective power of organization is huge. Collective decision, common will, and common effort are strength. He pointed out that consolidating the existing agricultural cooperatives is progress. As for when to complete agricultural collectivization, it should be determined according to actual conditions.

    卡达尔和卡拉伊在爱国人民阵线会议上指出
    匈牙利经济文化建设稳步前进
    提前实现三年计划和巩固农业社是目前中心任务
    新华社布达佩斯讯　匈牙利爱国人民阵线全国委员会19日举行会议。会上社会主义工人党政治局委员、党中央书记处书记、爱国人民阵线全国委员会主席卡拉伊就匈牙利当前政治、经济和文化问题作了报告。
    卡拉伊在报告中谈到了匈牙利人民与社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的团结，社会主义思想在匈牙利的胜利以及匈牙利经济建设的成就。他说，今年头五个月，匈牙利国营工业的总产值比去年同期增加了7％到8％。
    卡拉伊指出，今年匈牙利农产品预计收成良好。巩固新成立的农业生产合作社仍然是非常重要的任务。为此，匈牙利工人阶级和政府将大力帮助新成立的农业生产合作社。
    卡拉伊指出，匈牙利文化阵线上社会主义革命也在很有成效地向前发展着。党的思想在文化生活领域中的影响加强了，忠于社会主义的党员和党外知识分子的队伍扩大了。匈牙利的文学和艺术已承担起了对群众进行社会主义教育的任务。卡拉伊接着指出，匈牙利文化生活继续向前发展的重要因素是加强文艺工作者同工农的直接联系。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央第一书记卡达尔也在会上讲了话。
    他指出，党和人民目前的中心任务是实现党中央三月全体扩大会议所提出的提前一年完成三年计划主要指标的决议以及巩固农业生产合作社。
    卡达尔说，党中央的三月决议是代表全体人民的利益的。为了实现这个决议，广大劳动群众纷纷提出了具体的保证。从目前的成绩来看，他们是实践了自己的诺言，并且可能会超额完成原订的计划。他强调说，我们的政策路线的实质就是继续建设和建成社会主义，将来进入共产主义，这一点是绝不会改变的。今年年底将召开的党代表大会会进一步加强这一路线。
    在谈到农业合作化运动时卡达尔说，这个问题关系到整个社会的发展和民族的未来，我们必须建成现代化的社会主义农业。他指出，决定合作化运动向前发展的首先是政治条件。卡达尔批判了那种过于强调经济条件，主张先要创造组织农业生产合作社的经济条件，然后才能成立合作社的观点。他说，农民们知道，就是国家连一把镰刀也不给他们，组织起来的集体力量也是巨大的。集体的决定、共同的意志、共同的努力就是力量。他指出，巩固现有的农业合作社就是前进，至于什么时候完成农业合作化，则要根据实际情况来决定。
