Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th: Responsible cadres of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Military Region, including Zhang Guohua and Zhou Renshan, recently went to Zetang, Naidong Zong, Gongga Zong, and Longzi Zong in the Shannan area to visit the monks, laypeople, and patriotic progressive figures who have long suffered from the persecution of the rebel bandits, and to gain an in-depth understanding of the social situation in the Shannan area after the suppression of the rebellion.

During their time in Shannan, Zhang Guohua, Zhou Renshan, and others went to the homes of poor serfs and Langsheng (house slaves), had cordial talks with them, inquired about their opinions on the central government's policies and the implementation of these policies by the People's Liberation Army and working personnel, and expressed great concern for the sufferings of the serfs and house slaves.

A poor farmer named Dawa from Naidong Zong in the Shannan area said during a heart-to-heart talk with the visitors: "In the past, we were worried all day long about debts that could not be repaid and corvée labor that could not be completed. When the rebel bandits were entrenched here, they would come from time to time to rob us of our already meager grain and livestock. I have lived for sixty years and have never felt so happy as I do now. It's as if a stone has been lifted from my head!"

The old man said that he used to be a Chabpa (serf) on the estate of a noble in Qushui. Because he could not pay the rent and taxes, he suffered beatings from the owner. In the end, the owner forcibly took his belongings and even took his son away as a house slave. He and his wife had no choice but to flee to Naidong, but life here was equally difficult. He rented three "ke" of land from the landlord through another Chabpa, and over the years had accumulated dozens of "ke" of debt. Dawa said: "If the People's Liberation Army had not come, I don't know when we poor people would have had a chance to stand up." He finally asked the visitors to help him find his missing son as soon as possible.

In Qushui, a Langsheng named Dorje told the visitors that because his father rented five "ke" of land from the Chumu Lin Temple, he was sent to be a house slave. From morning till night, he worked like an animal, with no freedom at all. He wasn't even allowed to go home to visit his parents and often had to go half-fed.

Dawa, Dorje, and other serfs and house slaves who were visited, all firmly demanded democratic reforms, especially the eager abolition of the Ula system and the abolition of the landlords' usurious exploitation, and the restoration of the Langsheng's personal freedom.

The peasants in the Shannan area generally praised the policy stipulated by the People's Government this year that land belonging to the rebels should be cultivated by whoever tills it. They said that this policy greatly encouraged their enthusiasm for production, and that they cultivated more land this year than in previous years. They also deeply thanked the People's Liberation Army for assisting them in spring plowing, repairing irrigation channels, etc. A serf named Gesang Wuzhu said: "In the past, the Zong government only cared about asking us for corvée labor and livestock for the landlords, and for grain and grass for the rebel bandits, and never did a good deed for us. When the Khampa rebel bandits fled here, in addition to looting grain, cattle, horses, and raping women, they also forced us to become so-called 'Volunteer Army to Defend Religion'." He said: "Now, the People's Liberation Army has come. They neither demand corvée labor nor beat people, and their transactions are fair. At the same time, they also help us to repair irrigation ditches, rush to plant crops, and repair houses damaged by the rebel bandits, etc. In particular, they have transported a large number of reasonably priced tea and salt. During the rebel bandit rebellion, we had no tea and could only boil wild grass from the mountains to drink as tea, which was a terrible experience!"

During this visit, Zhang Guohua, Zhou Renshan, and others also encouraged the troops engaged in suppressing the rebellion in the Shannan area. In Longzi Zong, Zhang Guohua, Zhou Renshan, and others met with soldiers Zhou Shirong and Yan Yuting, and commended them for their heroic and resourceful actions in annihilating a hundred rebel bandits with a smaller force in the battle to suppress the rebellion. In Zetang, they consoled the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who were gloriously wounded in the suppression of the rebellion in Shannan, and laid wreaths at the martyrs' cemetery in Zetang. The accompanying song and dance troupe and Henan opera troupe held慰问 performances for the troops and Tibetan compatriots along the way.

    西藏工委、自治区筹委会和军区负责干部
    深入山南访贫问苦
    农奴家奴热望废除剥削制度恢复人身自由
    新华社拉萨5日电中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹委会和西藏军区的负责干部张国华、周仁山等，最近到山南地区的泽当、乃东宗、贡噶宗、隆子宗等地，访问了长期受叛匪迫害的僧俗人民和爱国进步人士，并且深入了解了山南地区在平息叛乱后的社会情况。
    张国华、周仁山等在山南期间，曾到穷苦的农奴和朗生（家奴）家里，同他们作了亲切的谈话，询问了他们对中央各项政策以及对解放军和工作人员执行这些政策的意见，并且对农奴和家奴们的疾苦表示极大的关怀。
    山南地区乃东宗的一个名叫达华的穷苦农民在同访问者促膝谈心的时候说：“过去我们一天到晚发愁的是还不清的债务和支不完的差役。叛匪盘据这里的时候，他们不时来抢我们已经少得可怜的粮食和牲口。我活了六十年却从来没有像现在这么痛快过，真好像取下了压在头上的石头那么轻松！”
    这个老人说，他过去在曲水一个贵族的领地里当差巴，由于缴不起租税，受尽了主人的鞭打。最后主人强占了他的东西，还把他的儿子押走当家奴。他不得不和他的妻子逃亡到乃东，可是这里的生活也同样的难熬。他租了别的差巴从领主那儿租来的三克地，几年来又累积了几十克的债务。达华说：
  “要是没有人民解放军来到，不知道那天才有我们穷人出头的日子。”他最后还请求访问者帮助他很快见到他的不知下落的儿子。
    在曲水，一个名叫多吉的朗生对访问者说：由于他父亲租了促木林寺院的五克土地，结果就把他送去当家奴。从早到晚，他像牲畜般地劳动，没有一点自由，连回家去探望父母也不可以，又经常只得半饱。
    达华、多吉以及被访问的其他农奴、家奴，都坚决要求进行民主改革，特别是热望废除乌拉制度和废除领主的高利贷剥削，恢复朗生的人身自由。
    山南地区的农民普遍赞扬人民政府规定的今年对叛乱者的土地实行谁种谁收的政策。他们说，这个政策大大地鼓励了他们的生产热情，他们今年耕种的土地都超过了往年。他们还深切感谢人民解放军协助他们春耕、修渠等。一个名叫格桑伍珠的农奴说：“过去的宗政府只管替领主们向我们要差役、要牲口，为叛匪要粮、要草，从来不给我们办一件好事。当康巴叛匪流窜到这里时，他们除了抢粮、抢牛马和奸淫妇女外，还强迫我们去当所谓‘卫教志愿军’”，他说：“现在，解放军来了。他们既不支差，又不打人，买卖公平，同时还帮助我们整修水渠、抢种和修理被叛匪破坏的房舍等等。特别是运来了大批价格公道的茶叶和盐巴。在叛匪叛乱期间我们没茶叶，只能熬山上的野草当茶喝，这个滋味是够受的！”
    张国华、周仁山等在这次访问中还对山南地区的平叛部队进行了鼓励。在隆子宗，张国华、周仁山等接见了士兵周仕荣和严于庭，对他们两人在平叛战斗中以少胜多、英勇机智地全歼一百名叛匪的行为，表示嘉勉。在泽当，他们慰问了在山南平叛中光荣负伤的人民解放军官兵，并向泽当的烈士墓献了花圈。随同前来的文工团和豫剧团曾在沿途为驻军和藏胞举行了慰问演出。
