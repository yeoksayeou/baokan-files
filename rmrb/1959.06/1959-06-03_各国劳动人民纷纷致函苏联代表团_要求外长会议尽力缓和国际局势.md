Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 2nd. TASS reported: The Soviet delegation attending the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has continuously received numerous appeals, letters, and telegrams requesting the Geneva Conference to make every effort to ease international tensions and end the "Cold War."

    Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin met with a delegation of French and West German construction workers. The delegation handed him an appeal to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, signed by construction workers from North Rhine-Westphalia in West Germany and Alsace in France. The appeal called for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to prevent the resurgence of West German militarism, and to create conditions to prevent West Berlin from threatening world peace. The appeal also called for a summit meeting to be convened as soon as possible.

    The Soviet delegation also met with representatives of the working people and residents of Saint-Denis, France. On behalf of all the residents of the city, they handed the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister a petition from the Saint-Denis union organizations of the French General Confederation of Labor and the Workers' Force General Confederation, and a petition from the city's Peace Committee. At the initiative of the local Peace Committee, trade union organizations, and the French Women's Union, these petitions were distributed in various residential areas and enterprises in Saint-Denis, and collected 5,649 residents' signatures.

    Both petitions strongly demanded that the foreign ministers strive to ease international tensions.

    Four representatives of the West German Committee for the Promotion of German Trade also visited the Soviet delegation and handed the delegation a letter to the delegations of countries participating in the Geneva Conference. The letter pointed out that the committee believes that negotiations on a peace treaty with Germany must be held immediately, as a peace treaty with Germany is a decisive step in the economic reunification of Germany and will greatly contribute to the easing of international tensions.

    苏联外交部副部长佐林接见了法国和西德建筑工人代表团，在这个代表团交给他的一份给外长会议的呼吁书上签字的，是西德北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州和法国的阿尔萨斯省的建筑工人。呼吁书要求缔结对德和约，以便制止西德军国主义的复活，并且要求创造条件，防止西柏林对世界和平的威胁。呼吁书还要求尽快召开最高级会议。
    苏联代表团还接见了法国圣但尼城的劳动人民和居民代表。他们代表全市居民交给苏联外交部副部长一份法国总工会和工人力量总工会圣但尼城工会组织的请愿书和一份这个城市的和平委员会的请愿书。在当地和平委员会、工会组织以及法国妇女联合会的倡议下，在圣但尼的各居民区和企业散发了这些请愿书，并搜集了五千六百四十九个居民的签名。
    这两份请愿书都坚决要求外长们努力谋求国际局势的缓和。
    西德促进德国贸易委员会的四位代表也访问了苏联代表团。并交给代表团一封写给参加日内瓦会议各国代表团的信。信中指出，委员会认为必须立即举行有关对德和约的谈判，因为对德和约是德国经济重新统一的决定性步骤，它将在很大程度上有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。
