Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 31st: Shanghai commercial departments are vigorously transferring various daily-use industrial products to supply the peak rural market season after the wheat harvest. Since the second quarter, over 80,000 tons of daily-use merchandise, knitwear, cotton textiles, cotton cloth, and medicines have been shipped from here via land and water, with a total value of goods increasing by 4.5% compared to the same period last year.

This year, because farmers' purchasing power has further increased, the demand from various regions for summer supplies from Shanghai is large and early. In light of this situation, Shanghai commercial departments decided that in addition to delivering the originally planned 145 million meters of light-colored printed cloth and ramie fabric as early as possible, they would also increase the supply by 20 million meters. The supply plans for summer seasonal items such as undershirts, vests, towels, light-colored patterned socks, talcum powder, cologne, and sunscreen cream have all been increased this year compared to last year, and most have already been shipped.

When organizing the supply of goods, Shanghai commercial departments, in conjunction with industrial departments, designed and manufactured many new products based on the needs of various regions. This year, Shanghai produced nearly 300 new styles of undershirts and vests, including fully open-front men's shirts that are easy to put on and take off, suitable for elderly people in rural areas; colorful printed undershirts with half-sleeves and large sleeves favored by rural women; and various undershirts and vests suitable for students, athletes, and children. There are more than 1,500 new patterns of light-colored printed cloth.

Shanghai commercial departments are doing everything possible to help factories open up sources of raw materials and support factories in increasing the production of summer supplies. Many purchasing and supply stations have established raw material groups and other specialized agencies to find raw materials and packaging materials everywhere. Since the second quarter, the Shanghai Waste Products Company has added more than 40 recycling stations and more than 160 mobile acquisition teams throughout the city to expand waste recycling operations. They recently supplied factories with more than 30,000 tons of recycled waste metal, rubber, plastic, rags, broken glass, and old cotton wadding, solving the raw material problems for some of the factories' products.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 31st: Tianjin commercial departments are adapting to the market needs after the summer harvest, using thousands of various vehicles every day to transport summer goods to rural areas. The Tianjin Textile, Knitwear, and Pharmaceutical Purchasing and Supply Stations saw an increase in the supply of goods in May compared to the same period last year.

Because the summer grain harvest season in the South is earlier, Tianjin commercial departments planned to supply Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces with knitwear such as undershirts, vests, and socks in June, and 40% of these were shipped in advance between April and May. A batch of light-colored printed cloth that Sichuan Province requested Tianjin to supply in addition to the second-quarter plan has recently been shipped to Sichuan.

Tianjin commercial departments arranged the production of summer goods as early as February and increased the variety of colors and patterns based on the needs of the rural people. For women's young-style short-sleeved cotton undershirts alone, more than 30 colors such as pink, apricot yellow, and light green were added. There are more than 100 new designs for summer printed cloth. Rural women prefer geometric pattern cloth, and the geometric pattern cloth organized by the commercial departments this year accounts for about half of the total output of light-colored printed cloth.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 31st: As new wheat is successively harvested in Hubei Province, the staff of commercial departments throughout the province are actively transporting summer goods to the mountains and rural areas to supply the vast number of farmers who have achieved a bumper wheat harvest.

The commercial departments of Hubei Province began organizing the supply of summer goods this year as early as the end of last year. Summer goods purchased from cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou began to be shipped to various parts of Hubei in March this year. Undershirts, vests, and other items produced in Wuhan, Shashi, Xiangfan, and other cities are also constantly being transported to rural areas. According to statistics from the Provincial Department of Commerce, the quantity of main summer goods such as undershirts and vests supplied to rural areas this year has increased compared to last year, and the time of transfer has been advanced by about a month compared to previous years. Currently, 70% of the main summer goods in the supply plan have been transported to rural areas, and farmers can buy these goods at nearby stores at any time.

    上海天津湖北商业部门适应农民当前需要
    大批夏令商品调运下乡
    新华社上海31日电　上海商业部门正在大力调运各种日用工业品，供应麦收后的农村市场旺季。第二季度以来，通过水陆两路从这里运出的日用百货、针棉织品、棉布和药品等已有八万吨，商品总值比去年同期增加4.5％。
    今年因为农民购买力进一步提高，各地要求上海供应的夏令用品数量大，时间早。根据这一情况，上海商业部门决定除对原计划供应的一亿四千五百万公尺浅色花布、花麻纱尽量提前交货外，还要增加供应量二千万公尺；夏季当令品汗衫、背心、汗巾、浅色花套袜、爽身粉、花露水、防晒香脂等供应计划，今年都比去年增加，现在大部分已经运出。
    上海商业部门在组织货源时，会同工业部门根据各地需要设计制造了许多新产品。今年上海市生产的新式样汗衫、背心近三百种。其中，有穿脱方便，适合农村老年人用的全开襟男衫；有农村妇女喜爱的半袖、大袖的彩色印花汗衫；还有适合学生、运动员、儿童们穿用的各种汗衫、背心。浅色花布的新花样有一千五百多种。
    上海商业部门千方百计地帮助工厂开辟原料来源，支援工厂增产夏令用品。许多采购供应站建立了原料小组和其他专门机构，四出寻找原料材料和包装器材。上海废品公司第二季度以来，在全市增设了四十多个回收站和一百六十多个流动收购队，扩大废品回收业务。他们最近给工厂供应了三万多吨回收的废金属、橡胶、塑料、破布、碎玻璃和旧棉絮等，解决了各工厂一部分产品的原料问题。
    新华社天津31日电　天津市商业部门适应夏收后的市场需要，每天用数以千计的各种车辆把夏令商品源源运往各地农村。天津市纺织品、针棉织品、医药三个采购供应站，5月份的商品供应量比去年同期都有增长。
    因为南方夏粮收获季节较早，天津商业部门计划在6月份供应湖南、湖北、安徽等省的汗衫、背心、袜子等针织品，已有40％提前在4、5月间运出。四川省要求天津市在第二季度计划以外增加供应的一批浅色花布，最近已运去四川。
    天津市商业部门早在2月间，就安排了夏令货的生产，并且根据农村人民的需要，增加了花色品种。仅妇女穿的青年式短袖棉毛汗衫，就增加了粉红、杏黄、淡绿等三十多种花色。新设计的夏季花布的花型有一百多个。农村妇女喜爱几何图案的花布，商业部门今年组织的几何图案花布占浅色花布总产量的一半左右。
    据新华社武汉31日电　湖北省新麦陆续登场，省内各地商业部门的职工正在积极地运送夏令商品上山下乡，供应获得小麦丰收的广大农民。
    湖北省商业部门早在去年年底就动手组织今年夏令商品的货源。从上海、天津、广州等城市采购的夏令商品，今年3月份就开始陆续运到湖北各地。武汉、沙市、襄樊等市自己生产的汗衫、背心等也不断运往农村。据省商业厅统计，今年供应农村的汗衫、背心等主要夏令商品，数量比去年增加，下调时间比往年提早约一个月。现在，占供应计划70％的主要夏令商品已经运到农村，农民们随时都能在附近的商店里买到这些商品。
