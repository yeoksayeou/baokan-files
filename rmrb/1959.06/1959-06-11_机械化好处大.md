　　One person contracts to manage more than 2,000 mu of corn
　　Because the sowing, cultivation, and harvesting of corn are all mechanized, Agricultural Labor Hero Manukovsky of the Russian Federal Republic guarantees to cultivate 150 hectares (2,250 mu) of corn this year alone, yielding no less than 500 quintals of stalks and ears per hectare. In addition, he also guarantees to plant 75 hectares (1,125 mu) of sunflowers. One of his assistants cultivated 200 hectares (3,000 mu) of corn last year alone, with an average yield of 412 quintals of cobs and green fodder per hectare. The labor consumption per unit of output was reduced by two-thirds compared to the original, saving the collective farm 1,800 workdays.

　　Two people raise 2,500 pigs
　　The pig farm of the "Educational Experiment" state farm in Rostov Oblast, Soviet Union, is fully mechanized. Two breeders raise 2,500 pigs. The breeders use simple mechanized tools to distribute feed, water, clean the pig farm, and remove manure from the pig pens, increasing their labor productivity by almost nine times.

　　One person cares for 6,000 chickens
　　The Ukrainian "鲍尔基" chicken farm near Kharkov, Soviet Union, has a large-scale mechanized poultry farm. Breeder Sidora alone cares for 6,000 chickens and guarantees to collect one million eggs each year. The work on the chicken farm, from distributing feed and collecting eggs to tidying up the bedding, is all mechanized. If some work is improved, especially if feeding is fully mechanized, then one person can care for 12,000 chickens and collect two million eggs each year.

    机械化好处大
      一个人包干两千多亩玉蜀黍
    由于玉蜀黍的播种、中耕、收获等全部实行机械化，俄罗斯联邦共和国农业劳动英雄马努科夫斯基今年保证一个人耕种一百五十公顷（二千二百五十亩）玉蜀黍，每公顷收秆和穗不下五百公担，此外还保证种七十五公顷（一千一百二十五亩）的向日葵。他的一个助手去年一个人耕种了二百公顷（三千亩）玉蜀黍，平均每公顷收了四百一十二公担穗轴和青饲料，单位产量的劳动消耗比原来减少了三分之二，为农庄节约了一千八百个工作日。
  	两个人养两千五百头猪
    苏联罗斯托夫州“教育实验”国营农场的养猪场，全部实现了机械化。两个饲养员饲养着二千五百头猪。饲养员用一些简单的机械化工具来分发饲料、喂水、洗刷猪场和猪圈中的粪便，其劳动生产率几乎提高了九倍。	  一个人照料六千只鸡
    苏联哈尔科夫城郊乌克兰“鲍尔基”养鸡站设有大型机械化养禽场。饲养员西多拉一个人照料着六千只鸡，并保证每年收一百万个鸡蛋。鸡场上的工作，从分发饲料，收集鸡蛋一直到收拾铺草等都是机械化。如果把某些工作改进一下，特别是使喂食全盘机械化，那么一个人可以照料一万二千只鸡，每年收二百万只鸡蛋。
