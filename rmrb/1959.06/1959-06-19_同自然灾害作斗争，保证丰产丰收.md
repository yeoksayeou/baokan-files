Fight Against Natural Disasters to Ensure Bumper Harvests
Vice Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, Rao Xing

The period from late spring to early autumn is when disastrous weather is relatively frequent and concentrated, and it is also the main season for production. In the current situation where we cannot completely control weather changes, weather disasters become the most important enemy of all kinds of production, especially agricultural production.

Generally speaking, disastrous weather comes fiercely and causes great harm, but it lasts for a relatively short time and is relatively easy to detect in advance. As long as we are good at mastering and using forecasts, and prepare for prevention in peacetime, we can reduce or avoid losses by taking measures and handling emergencies after receiving disastrous weather forecasts or warnings. For example, in Baoqing County, Heilongjiang Province, there were three frosts, strong winds, and moderate rains in September and October last year. Thanks to timely forecasts and warnings, the county party committee made early arrangements and deployments, avoiding the loss of more than 7.6 million catties of grain. As another example, Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, prevented frost three times in October last year, increasing cotton production by 3 million catties. Examples like these have already begun to appear in various places during this year's summer harvest and summer planting. Therefore, as long as we seize favorable opportunities and actively carry out defense, disastrous weather is not terrible.

In the fight against natural disasters, meteorological work is a vanguard. To adapt to the needs of the high-speed development of national construction, this vanguard is increasingly expanding the scope of its service to production. To enable this vanguard to better play its role, we must further implement the policy of taking serving production as the key, with agricultural service as the focus, proceeding from the needs of production in everything, closely centering on the central tasks of the local party committees in various periods, and actively carrying out service work. In service work, we must be broad, in-depth, meticulous, and solid; we must not only make general weather forecasts, but also make professional forecasts suitable for various professional requirements. Doing a good job in forecasting and serving production is the fundamental task of meteorological work. Good service is conducive to the development of industrial and agricultural production; at the same time, it also promotes the progress of meteorological business.

The key to doing a good job in meteorological service is to continuously improve the quality of service. At present, we must focus on three major tasks.

First, consolidate the meteorological service network. The meteorological service network is the organizational foundation for carrying out meteorological services. Over the past ten years, the construction of the meteorological service network has been very rapid. In the past, it played a certain role in serving national defense construction and economic construction. However, serving the vast rural areas and agricultural production has been extremely inadequate. Under the new situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, the contradictions became more prominent. After the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, our minds were liberated, and under the leadership of the Party, we resolutely followed the mass line. In less than a year, we basically achieved the goal of having a station in every special zone, a station in every county, a post in every commune, and a group in every team throughout the country. In the past, we only relied on a few meteorological stations to do weather forecasting service work. Now, professional scientific institutions and mass meteorological organizations are closely cooperating, from point to surface, and stations, posts, and groups must carry out forecasting services. The posts and groups of the people's communes have become the most direct units serving agricultural production. The posts and groups are all newly established mass organizations that do not separate from production, and must be vigorously consolidated and improved. The key to consolidation and improvement lies in carrying out services. Good service will consolidate, and good consolidation will surely lead to better service.

Second, do a good job in supplementary forecasting. Only accurate forecasts of future weather changes are conducive to arranging and carrying out production activities. At present, an effective method to improve the quality of forecasts is to supplement and correct them level by level through the vast number of meteorological stations, posts, and groups, based on the large-scale weather forecasts of the meteorological stations. This can not only improve the accuracy of forecasts, but also strengthen the service effect.

Third, carry out agricultural meteorological forecasting. Doing a good job in agricultural meteorological forecasting, making full use of meteorological factors in nature that are conducive to crop growth, and preventing and overcoming meteorological conditions in nature that are unfavorable to crop growth, play a major role in ensuring bumper harvests in agriculture.

Finally, to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts and make them better serve production, we must further strengthen the Party's leadership over meteorological work. We believe that Party and government leading organs and production departments at all levels should correctly grasp and use weather forecasts and not absolutize them. Because weather changes vary with different terrains, geographical locations, etc., and even vary greatly. As the saying goes, "Thunderstorms are separated by the back of an ox." Although this sentence may seem a bit exaggerated, it reveals the regionality and complexity of weather changes. At present, due to the limitations of objective conditions, large-scale weather forecasts made by meteorological stations are difficult to predict the weather conditions in every specific place within the jurisdiction, and the accuracy rate of 24-hour weather forecasts is only 76% on average. Therefore, in addition to listening to the forecasts of meteorological stations, it is more important to listen to the supplementary forecasts of local stations, posts, and groups. Because stations, posts, and groups are more specific and have more experience in mastering the characteristics of local weather than stations. The accuracy rate of large-scale weather forecasts can generally be improved after supplementary correction, but it still cannot be 100% accurate. Therefore, when using forecasts, the final analysis and judgment must be made by the Party and government leading organs at all levels.

It is precisely because the large-scale weather forecasts made by meteorological stations cannot be very detailed, specific, and closely integrated with the different requirements of production in various places, so they are "not applicable everywhere." Therefore, when higher-level leading organs issue decision-making instructions based on weather forecasts, they must leave room for maneuver so that local areas can listen to the supplementary and corrected forecasts of stations, posts, and groups, and take production measures according to local conditions. Also, because weather forecasts cannot be absolutely accurate every time, Party and government leading organs at all levels also need to be ideologically and materially prepared to cope with sudden weather changes in order to make up for the shortcomings of meteorological technical conditions and minimize the losses from natural disasters.

    同自然灾害作斗争，保证丰产丰收
    中央气象局副局长　饶兴
    春末到秋初之间，是灾害性天气比较多、比较集中的时期，同时也正是生产的主要季节。在当前我们还不能完全控制天气变化的情况下，天气灾害就成为各项生产，特别是农业生产最主要的敌人。
    一般来说，灾害性天气来势凶猛，危害甚大，但持续时间较短，事先比较容易发现，只要我们善于掌握和运用预报，平时做好预防准备，当收到灾害性天气预报或者警报以后，采取措施，紧急处理，就可以减轻或者避免损失。如黑龙江省宝清县去年9、10月份出现了三次霜冻、大风和中雨，由于预报和警报及时，县委及早作了安排和部署，避免损失粮食七百六十多万斤。又如，江苏省泗阳县去年10月份，防了三次霜，使棉花增产三百万斤。像这样的例子，在今年的夏收夏种中，各地也已经开始出现。因此，只要抓住有利时机，积极进行防御，灾害性天气并没有什么可怕。
    在与自然灾害作斗争中，气象工作是一支尖兵。为了适应国家建设高速度发展的需要，这支尖兵正在日益扩大为生产服务的范围。要使这支尖兵更好地发挥作用，必须进一步贯彻以服务生产为纲，以农业服务为重点的方针，一切从生产需要出发，紧紧围绕各地党委在各个时期的中心任务，积极开展服务工作。在服务工作中，要做到广泛、深入、细致、扎实；既要做出一般性的天气预报，还要做出适合各种不同专业要求的专业预报。做好预报，做好为生产的服务工作，是气象工作的根本任务。服务得好，既有利于工农业生产的发展；同时，也推动了气象业务的进展。
    做好气象服务工作，关键就在于不断地提高服务质量。在当前必须抓住三件大事。
    第一，巩固气象服务网。气象服务网是开展气象服务的组织基础。十年来，气象服务网的建设是很迅速的。过去，在为国防建设和经济建设服务上起了一定的作用。但是，面向广大农村，为农业生产服务方面，就做得极为不够。在1958年工农业大跃进的新形势下，矛盾更加突出。经过整风运动和反右斗争，解放了思想，在党的领导下，坚决走群众路线，不到一年的时间，在全国范围内，基本上实现了专区有台、县县有站、社社有哨、队队有组。过去仅依靠少数气象台做天气预报服务工作，现在是专业科学机关与群众性气象组织密切配合，由点到面，台、站、哨、组都要开展预报服务，人民公社的哨、组已经成为农业生产服务最直接的单位。哨、组全部是新建立的、不脱离生产的群众性组织，还必须大力巩固和提高。巩固、提高的关键在于开展服务，服务得好，就能巩固，巩固得好，一定服务得更好。
    第二，做好补充预报。只有准确地预报未来天气的变化，才有利于安排和进行生产活动。当前，提高预报质量的有效方法，就是在气象台大范围天气预报的基础上，通过广大的气象站、哨、组，层层补充，级级订正。这样，既可以提高预报的准确率，又加强了服务效果。
    第三，开展农业气象预报。做好农业气象预报，充分利用自然界有利于作物生长的气象因素；防止和战胜自然界不利于作物生长的气象条件，对保证农业丰产丰收，有着重大的作用。
    最后，要提高天气预报的准确率，使之更好地为生产服务，必须进一步加强党对气象工作的领导。我们认为，各地党政领导机关和生产部门，应正确地掌握和使用天气预报，不要绝对化。因为，天气变化随着地形、地理位置等的不同，各有差异，甚至差异很大。俗话说：“雷雨隔牛背”，这句话虽然看来有些夸张，但却道出了天气变化的地区性和复杂性。目前，气象台做的大范围天气预报，由于客观条件的限制，很难预报出管辖区内每个具体的地方天气情况，二十四小时的天气预报准确率平均只有76％。所以，除了收听气象台的预报以外，更重要的是要听取当地站、哨、组的补充预报。因为站、哨、组在掌握本地天气的特点方面，比台具体，经验也多。大范围天气预报，经过补充订正后，准确率一般能提高一些，但还不能百分之百准确。因此，在使用预报时，必须由各地党、政领导机关作最后的分析判断。
    正因为气象台所做的大范围天气预报不能十分细致、具体、密切结合各地生产上不同的要求，所以是“四海不皆准”。因而上级领导机关在根据天气预报下达决策性指示的时候，必须留有机动余地，好让地方多听取站、哨、组的补充订正预报，采取因地因事制宜的生产措施。又因为天气预报还不可能做到每次都绝对准确，因而各地党、政领导机关还需要有应付天气突然变化的思想准备和物质准备，以弥补气象技术条件的不足，尽量减免自然灾害的损失。
