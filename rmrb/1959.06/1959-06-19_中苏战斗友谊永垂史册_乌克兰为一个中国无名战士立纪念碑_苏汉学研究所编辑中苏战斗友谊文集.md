Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: TASS, Kiev dispatch: In the village of Pavlovka in the Dnepropetrovsk region of Ukraine, a monument to an unknown Chinese soldier has recently been erected to commemorate a Chinese soldier who heroically sacrificed himself forty years ago while fighting in the Soviet army against the enemies of the young Soviet Republic. The monument was erected according to the decision of the general meeting of the local collective farm members. Inscribed on the monument in golden letters are the words: “Eternal Glory to the Unknown Chinese Hero Who Sacrificed His Life for the Liberation of Ukraine.”
    For forty years, the working people of the village of Pavlovka have been caring for the grave of this Chinese soldier with concern.
    The elders of the village, in recalling the Chinese soldier's dedication of his precious life to the young Soviet regime, said that at that time, a small detachment of Red Army soldiers repelled a fierce attack by White bandit troops who wanted to seize the village of Pavlovka. However, due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, the Red Army soldiers needed to temporarily retreat. A small group of Red Army soldiers was left behind to protect the village, including a Chinese youth who volunteered to join the Red Army. This Chinese hero was seriously wounded in a fierce battle and was captured by the enemy when he lost consciousness. Later, the White bandit troops hanged this brave soldier in front of the villagers. A few days later, the enemy was driven away, and the local residents buried their friend and brother with respect.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: TASS dispatch: The Institute of Sinology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is preparing to publish a collection of essays on the deeds of Chinese volunteers who participated in the October Socialist Revolution and the Civil War.
    The collection includes academic works written by Soviet scholars based on historical materials and Soviet newspaper materials from 1917 to 1925, memoirs of Chinese volunteers who participated in Red Army troops and guerrilla warfare, and many documents from this period preserved in the archives of Moscow, Leningrad, Siberia, and the Far East.
    At the same time, the Institute of Sinology is also studying and compiling a collection of essays on the participation of Soviet volunteers in the First Chinese Revolutionary Civil War (1924-1927).
    The above two collections are just the beginning of compiling memoirs and articles on the combat friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union in the revolutionary and liberation struggles.
    The recent plans of the Institute of Sinology also include compiling a collection of essays on the participation of Soviet volunteers in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945).

    中苏战斗友谊永垂史册
    乌克兰为一个中国无名战士立纪念碑
    苏汉学研究所编辑中苏战斗友谊文集
    新华社莫斯科18日电　据塔斯社基辅讯：在乌克兰的第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州的巴甫洛夫卡村最近建立了一座中国无名战士纪念碑，纪念四十年前，在苏军部队中同年轻的苏维埃共和国的敌人作战而英勇牺牲的一名中国战士。这座纪念碑是根据当地集体农庄庄员全体会议的决定而建立的。碑上刻着金黄色的字样：“为争取乌克兰解放而献出生命的不知名的中国英雄永垂不朽”。
    四十年来，巴甫洛夫卡村的劳动人民一直关心地照料着这个中国战士的坟墓。
    这个村的老年人在追述这个中国战士为年轻的苏维埃政权献出自己的宝贵的生命时说，当时，有一小队红军战士击退了想要侵占巴甫洛夫卡村的白匪军的猛烈进攻。但是由于敌我力量悬殊，红军战士需要临时退却。为了掩护村庄，留下了一小组红军战士，其中有一名志愿参加红军的中国青年。这个中国英雄在一次激烈的战斗中受了重伤，并在失去知觉时被敌人俘获。后来，白匪军当着村民的面把这个勇敢的战士绞死了。几天后，敌人被赶跑，当地居民怀着尊敬的心情埋葬了自己的朋友和兄弟。
    新华社莫斯科18日电　据塔斯社讯：苏联科学院汉学研究所正准备出版一本关于中国志愿人员参加十月社会主义革命和国内战争的事迹的文集。
    文集中包括有苏联学者根据历史材料和1917—1925年间苏联报刊材料写成的学术著作、中国志愿人员参加红军部队和游击队作战的回忆录以及莫斯科、列宁格勒、西伯利亚和远东档案室中所保存的这一时期的许多文件。
    同时，汉学研究所还在研究编写关于苏联志愿军参加中国第一次国内革命战争（1924—1927年）的文集。
    上述两部文集只不过是编写在革命和解放斗争中苏中两国人民的战斗友谊的回忆录和文章的开始。
    汉学研究所的最近计划中还要编写关于苏联志愿军参加中国人民抗日战争（1937—1945年）的文集。
