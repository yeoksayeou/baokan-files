The Baomao Commune in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, based on "unified leadership, decentralized management" and the "three guarantees and double rewards" system, has launched a socialist labor competition among its members, centered on the current summer harvest and planting, focusing on "exceeding labor quotas," "surpassing high yields," "surpassing advanced levels," and "surpassing production targets."

Baomao Commune is one of the higher-yielding communes in Changshu County. According to the production targets discussed and implemented by the vast number of commune members, the total grain output of the entire commune this year will increase by about 30% compared to last year. In order to fulfill and overfulfill this year's production targets, the commune party committee believes that three main problems must be effectively addressed: solving the problem of labor shortage; rapidly increasing the output of low-yield production teams; and enabling the higher-yielding production teams to continue their great leap forward. The commune party committee mobilized cadres and commune members to discuss solutions, starting with summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. During the summary, two typical examples attracted widespread attention: one was the Ninth Brigade, which took corresponding measures to address the causes of low yield and, after a year of hard work, joined the ranks of high-yield brigades; the other was Shen Rongrong, a poor peasant "five-good" commune member of the Second Team of the Third Brigade, who used a combination of hard work and ingenuity to complete 636 workdays last year. The commune party committee believed that vigorously promoting the exemplary deeds of the Ninth Brigade and Shen Rongrong would have a positive effect on achieving this year's production tasks, so it proposed launching the "Four Exceeds" red banner competition.

In order to fully utilize the labor enthusiasm of the commune members, the production brigades and commune members discussed and decided to add a red banner labor quota on top of the basic labor quota for each type of farm work. In the public canteen of each production team, in addition to a "Commune Member Labor Attendance Rise and Fall Chart," a "Labor Hero List" and a "Labor Champion Platform" were established. The labor work points of commune members are implemented using the method of "daily recording, ten-day evaluation, and monthly settlement." Commune members who exceed the basic quota have their names placed on the "Hero List," and those who exceed the red banner quota have their names placed on the "Champion Platform." At the same time, according to the principle of "distribution according to work," a progressive reward system for labor remuneration is implemented. For example, for cutting green grass, the basic quota for each laborer per day is 400 catties, and the red banner quota is 600 catties. Within the basic quota, the labor remuneration is three work points per 100 catties. For every 100 catties exceeding the basic quota, one work point is added. The vast number of commune members, having learned Shen Rongrong's spirit of hard work and ingenious methods, actively arrange their own plans to exceed the quota based on the "Three-Day Farm Work Early Knowledge" announced by the team, and as a result, work efficiency has generally improved. The 340-plus commune members of the First Brigade who cut green grass originally averaged only over 250 catties per person per day. After the "Four Exceeds" movement was launched, they quickly increased to an average of over 640 catties of grass cut per day, breaking through the red banner quota. Yao Gengen, a young woman from this brigade, also set a record of cutting 1,050 catties of green grass in one day, surpassing Shen Rongrong. This record did not last for a few days before it was surpassed by Zhou Jinjin, a female commune member from the same brigade. According to statistics from the commune party committee in early May, in the twenty-plus days since the "Four Exceeds" movement was launched, more than 890 male and female commune members have exceeded the red banner labor quota, and 84 male and female commune members have caught up with or surpassed Shen Rongrong in one or several types of farm work. Shen Rongrong, however, has always maintained the title of "Labor Champion."

In the red banner competition for low-yield teams to surpass high-yield teams, a paired competition format is generally adopted. Because it is a collective competition, the scene is larger, the enthusiasm is higher, and there are more measures taken. The Thirteenth Brigade is the brigade with the worst conditions and the lowest yield in the entire commune. Two-thirds of their arable land is "pot-bottom land" (prone to flooding with even a little rain), and it is said to have "three harvests in nine years," so the yield has always been very low. After the "Four Exceeds" movement was launched, this team took the Ninth Brigade as a learning example, mobilized all commune members, specifically analyzed the causes of low yield, explored favorable conditions for increasing production, and proposed ten specific measures such as eradicating waterlogging, increasing fertilizer, improving soil, and developing sideline occupations. Cadres and commune members are full of energy, and twenty-one commune members have broken through the red banner labor quota, and eighteen female commune members have caught up with Zhou Jinjin, and all aspects of production are better than last year.

Among the eight high-yield brigades in the entire commune, a "three comparisons" cycle red banner competition was launched, comparing enthusiasm, the solidity of measures, and the quality of standards. In these advanced brigades, a small number of cadres and commune members began to develop complacency, saying: We have high yields every year, and we are advanced in everything. There is no problem in achieving this kind of target. The branches of each brigade focused on criticizing these arrogant and complacent sentiments. Driven by the red banner competition of "surpassing the advanced," every aspect of farm work in the high-yield brigades is earlier and better than last year. More than 70% of the commune members in the Fifth Brigade have doubled their labor quotas, and most of the preparatory work for the summer harvest and planting has been done ahead of schedule.

Driven by the "Four Exceeds" red banner competition movement, a high tide of summer harvest and planting production has been set off in Baomao Commune. The labor attendance rate of commune members has increased from 95% to 112% (including 1,100 extra laborers), and labor efficiency has significantly improved.

    劳动超定额　实产超包产
    常熟白茆公社开展竞赛推动夏收夏种
    本报讯　江苏常熟县白茆公社在“统一领导、分级管理”和“三包双奖”的基础上，以当前夏收夏种为中心内容，在社员中开展了
  “劳动超定额”，“高产超高产”，
  “先进超先进”，“实产超包产”的社会主义劳动竞赛。
    白茆公社是常熟县产量较高的一个公社。根据广大社员讨论落实的包产指标，今年全公社的粮食总产量将比去年增加三成左右。为完成和超额完成今年的包产指标，公社党委认为必须切实解决三个主要问题：解决劳动力不足的问题；迅速提高低产队的产量；使产量较高的生产队继续跃进。公社党委发动了干部和社员，从总结1958年大跃进的经验入手，讨论解决的办法。在总结中，有两个典型事例引起人们的普遍重视：一个是针对低产原因，采取相应措施，苦干一年跃入高产队行列的九大队；一个是运用苦干加巧干的办法，在去年一年中做了六百三十六个劳动日的三大队二小队的贫农“五好”社员沈荣荣。公社党委认为大力推广九大队和沈荣荣的模范事迹，对于实现今年的生产任务有积极作用，于是提出了开展“四超”红旗竞赛运动。
    为了充分发挥社员的劳动积极性，各生产大队和社员讨论决定，在每项农活的基本劳动定额之上，增加了红旗劳动定额。在每个生产队的公共食堂里，除了有一张“社员劳动出勤升降表”外，设立了“劳动英雄榜”和“劳动状元台”。社员劳动工分实行“日记、旬评、月结”的办法，超过基本定额的社员，名字上“英雄榜”，超过红旗定额的社员，名字上“状元台”。同时，根据“按劳分配”的原则，实行劳动报酬累进的奖励制度。例如割青草，每个劳动力一天的基本定额是四百斤，红旗定额是六百斤。在基本定额内，每百斤的劳动报酬为三个工分。超过基本定额的，每百斤增加一个工分。广大社员由于学习了沈荣荣的苦干精神和巧干办法，根据小队公布的“三天农活早知道”，主动安排自己超定额的计划，因而工效普遍提高。一大队三百四十多个割青草的社员，原来每人每天平均只割二百五十多斤，开展“四超”运动后，迅速地提高到每日平均割草六百四十多斤，突破了红旗定额。这个大队的青年妇女姚根根，还创造了一天割青草一千零五十斤的纪录，超过了沈荣荣。这项纪录并没有保持几天，又被本大队的妇女社员周金金超过了。据公社党委5月上旬的统计，“四超”运动开展以来的二十多天中，先后有八百九十多个男女社员超过了红旗劳动定额，八十四个男女社员有一项或几项农活赶上或超过了沈荣荣。沈荣荣则始终保持了“劳动状元”的称号。
    在低产队超高产队的红旗竞赛运动中，一般都采取挂钩竞赛的形式。由于是集体竞赛，因而场面更大，热气更高，措施更多。十三大队是全社条件最差、产量最低的大队。他们有三分之二的耕地属于“锅底田”（小雨就成涝），有“九年三熟”之说，产量一直很低。“四超”运动开展后，这个队以九大队为学习榜样，发动全体社员，具体分析低产原因，挖掘增产的有利条件，提出了根治内涝，增加肥料，改良土壤，发展副业等十项具体措施。干部和社员们个个干劲十足，全队先后有二十一个社员突破了红旗劳动定额，十八个妇女社员赶上了周金金，在各项生产上都比去年做得好。
    在全社八个高产大队之间，开展了比干劲足，比措施扎实，比规格质量好的“三比”循环红旗竞赛。在这些先进大队里，有一小部分干部和社员开始滋长了自满情绪，他们说：我们年年高产，样样先进，实现这种指标，没有问题。各大队支部着重批判了这些骄傲自满情绪。各个高产大队在“先进超先进”的红旗竞赛推动下，样样农活都比去年做得又早又好，五大队70％以上的社员成倍地突破了劳动定额，夏收夏种各项准备工作大部分已提前做好。
    在“四超”红旗竞赛运动的推动下，白茆公社掀起了夏收夏种生产高潮。社员劳动出勤率从95％提高到112％（其中有一千一百个等外劳动力），劳动效率显著提高。
