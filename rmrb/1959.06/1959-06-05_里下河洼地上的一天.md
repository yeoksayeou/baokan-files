A Day in the Lixiahe Depression

Before dawn, the field investigation team from the Geography Department of East China Normal University, consisting of five people, set off. Humming self-composed songs, they moved along a canal embankment in the Yangtze River Delta. They came here to provide data on the geomorphology, topography, and hydrology of the Lixiahe area for the country's Yangtze River Basin planning.

In an instant, the morning glow in the east shone with thousands of rays, and a golden depression appeared before them. Teacher Chen led everyone to sit down, talking and observing the terrain.

Before them was the "saucer-shaped" Lixiahe Depression. Looking from the edge of the Lixiahe Depression towards the center, the terrain gradually lowered. When they compared this terrain with the scenes they had observed earlier on the Fan Gong Dike and the ancient Yangtze River sandbar (natural levee), and associated it with the textbooks and materials they had studied, they deeply felt that the meaning of defining the Lixiahe area as a "saucer-shaped depression" was very accurate. However, the content of this "saucer-shaped depression" before them was much richer than what they learned in the classroom!

Work began. Observation, measurement, drawing cross-sectional diagrams, and on-site discussions were carried out. They discussed the differences in terrain between the east and west sides of the canal dike and the formation of the Lixiahe Depression. From the fact that the People's Government built this dike after liberation, protecting the Lixiahe area from river water damage, they explained the two fundamentally different attitudes towards natural disasters in the old and new societies. They also talked about some opinions on completely eradicating natural disasters and the construction of farmland water conservancy in Lixiahe. Teacher Chen, looking at the joyful expressions on everyone's faces, said with satisfaction, "Everyone has spoken profoundly. These two hours of fieldwork have enabled us to understand the geomorphic characteristics and formation of Lixiahe, and to explore some ways to transform and utilize it. You are future people's teachers, and you must not only have such rich scientific knowledge, but also have a lofty affection for the motherland…"

Teacher Chen's enthusiastic encouragement further stimulated the emotions of the young people. A Kang stood up suddenly and recited a allegro poem he had written on the spot:

"Speaking of the general survey, talking about the general survey, the significance of the general survey is truly great, the educational policy is implemented, and comprehensive exercise yields great gains." Shang Ji (with picture)

    里下河洼地上的一天
    天还没亮，华东师范大学地理系，由五个人组成的野外调查队就出发了。大家哼着自编的歌曲，在长江三角洲的一条运河大堤上行进着。他们到这里来，要为国家制订长江流域规划，提供里下河地区地貌地形和水文的资料。
    霎时，东方的朝霞闪出万道光芒，眼前出现一片金色的洼地，陈老师领着大家坐了下来，一面谈话，一面观察着地形。
    眼前就是“碟子形”的里下河洼地，从里下河洼地边缘向中心看，地形逐渐降低。他们把这个地形和不久前在范公堤和长江古砂嘴（天然堤）上观察的情景，与学习过的教材和资料联想在一起时，深深感到给里下河区下一个“碟形洼地”的意义是非常确切的。可是，眼前这个“碟形洼地”的内容，比之课堂学习，又是多么丰富啊！
    工作开始了。观察测量，画剖面图，展开现场讨论。他们讨论了运河堤东西地形的差异和里下河洼地的成因，从解放后人民政府修建了这条堤屏障着里下河地区免遭河水侵害，说明新旧社会对待自然灾害的两种根本不同的态度，他们又谈到了彻底根绝自然灾害和里下河农田水利建设的一些意见。陈老师望着大家脸上喜悦的神色，满意地说，大家讲得很深刻，这两个小时的野外工作，使我们了解了里下河的地貌特征和成因，摸索到一些改造、利用它的办法。你们是未来的人民教师，不但要有这样丰富的科学知识，而且还要有对祖国崇高的感情，……。
    陈老师热情的鼓励，更加激发了青年们的感情，阿康霍地站了起来，朗诵了他当场编写的一首快板诗：
    “说普查，道普查，普查意义真正大，教育方针得贯彻，全面锻炼收获大。”  尚纪（附图片）
