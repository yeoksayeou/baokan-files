Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 13th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro, at a rally of working people from all walks of life convened by the Cuban Workers' Confederation and the Culinary Workers' Federation on June 13th, called on the people to support the Land Reform Law and implement this decree regardless of all difficulties.

Castro said: "Provocative things are happening everywhere. The people see that they must rise up to defend the revolution; they must rise up to fight..." He pointed out that the counter-revolutionary conspiracies only prove that the people can only rely on themselves and can only rise up to defend themselves. At this workers' solidarity rally, Castro also said that the revolutionary government is as solid as a rock, it is a completely autonomous government, the Cuban people have grasped their own destiny, and they don't need to consider the opinions of others when formulating laws.

At a time when American imperialism is plotting to interfere in the Cuban revolution and domestic reactionary forces are stepping up their divisive activities, some Cuban newspapers and political parties have published commentaries and statements expressing support for the Cuban government and calling for strengthening domestic unity. "Revolución" condemned on the 13th those divisive remarks made under the pretext of anti-communism, and called on everyone to advance without hesitation side by side with all Cubans who yearn to establish a truly free Cuba without the Platt Amendment. "Combate" believes that the main point is to maintain unity. This newspaper, representing the opinions of the Revolutionary Directorate, said that the Cuban revolution is not a revolution of one party or faction. It called on free professionals, workers, students, and farmers to support the revolutionary government and abandon all sectarian divisive activities. The executive bureau of the National Committee of the People's Socialist Party issued a statement on the 13th, pointing out that it is necessary to intensify the condemnation of all counter-revolutionary conspiracies and make the masses more vigilant about the current dangers facing the country.

    卡斯特罗在工人集会上讲话
    号召人民坚决贯彻土改法
    新华社哈瓦那13日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗13日在古巴工人联合会和烹调联合会召开的各界劳动人民的集会上，号召人民支持土地改革法，不顾一切困难实行这个法令。
    卡斯特罗说：“到处都有挑衅的事情发生，人民看到，必须起来保卫革命；必须起来战斗……”。他指出，反革命的阴谋只不过证明，人民只能依靠自己，并且只能自己起来保卫自己。卡斯特罗在这次工人团结的大会上还说，革命政府固如磐石，它是一个完全自主的政府，古巴人民已经掌握自己的命运，在制订法律时用不着考虑别人意见。
    在美帝国主义阴谋干涉古巴的革命和国内反动势力加紧进行分裂活动的时候，古巴一些报纸和政党发表了评论和声明表示支持古巴政府，并且号召加强国内的团结。“革命报”13日谴责了那些以反共为口实发表的分裂言论，并且号召大家毫不犹豫地同一切渴望建立真正自由的、没有普拉特修正案的古巴人们并肩前进。“战斗报”认为，主要之点是保持团结。这家代表革命指导委员会意见的报纸说，古巴革命不是一党一派的革命。它呼吁自由职业者、工人、学生和农民支持革命政府，抛弃一切宗派主义的分裂活动。人民社会党全国委员会执行局13日发表的声明指出，必须加紧谴责一切反革命的阴谋活动，使群众进一步警惕国家当前的危险。
