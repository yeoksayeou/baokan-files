Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 26th: The National Bureau of Metrology recently held a meeting in Wuhan to exchange experiences in metrological work serving the mechanical industry. The meeting called on all regions to rapidly and comprehensively carry out metrological work to strive for improving the quality of mechanical industrial products and labor productivity.

The meeting pointed out that with the development of China's industry and scientific research, metrological work has shifted from managing commercial measures, weights, and balances to serving national economic construction, and currently mainly serves industry. The meeting analyzed the role of metrological work in the mechanical industry, pointing out that the mechanical industry must use measuring tools in design, technology, and equipment. Whether the measuring tools used are accurate, whether the measuring tools selected are appropriate, and whether the use is correct all fall within the scope of metrological work.

At present, in the rapidly developing mechanical industry in various regions, some small and medium-sized factories do not have accurate measuring tools. Some are rusty due to poor maintenance, and the scales are blurred. The actual error of some exceeds the allowable error by several times, which affects product quality. These factories urgently need to establish metrological work. Some factories with a good foundation, large scale, and established metrology rooms also need to improve measurement technology, carry out metrological research, and conduct more precise measurements as products develop towards heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge directions. The meeting believes that the main aspects of metrological work in the current mechanical industry are length metrology, such as measuring dimensions, angles, surface finish, concentricity, parallelism, and flatness. The second is temperature metrology, especially the measurement of molten iron and casting temperatures, which affect sand casting quality.

The meeting believes that at present, we should combine the quality inspection campaign and the establishment of enterprise management systems to carry out metrological work as soon as possible. First, establish metrological institutions universally. Each factory can establish a metrology room, inspection station, or assign a dedicated person to manage this work according to production needs. Each province, city, and autonomous region should establish a metrological transmission system and improve the metrological network. Regarding the necessary personnel and equipment for carrying out metrological work in various regions, the meeting believes that it can be solved through collaboration, with the metrology rooms of large enterprises with a metrological foundation helping small and medium-sized enterprises train personnel and provide some equipment; at the same time, organize and utilize the metrological resources of various universities.

This newspaper reports that in order to more effectively improve the quality of industrial products and increase labor productivity, the Tianjin Science and Technology Commission recently held a meeting on metrological and standardization work.

With the development of production, metrological work in Tianjin has also developed. It has developed from verifying ten or so kinds of instruments such as rulers and scales to being able to verify more than 250 kinds of measuring tools and instruments in four categories: length, mechanics, thermal engineering, and electrical engineering. Metrological work has played an important role in production. For example, metrological management personnel went deep into the small blast furnace groups in Zhangjiakou, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang to help solve nearly ten kinds of thermal instruments, which promoted the increase in steel production and quality. Before the Tianjin Tractor Factory established metrological work, it took workers with level five or higher technical skills forty-eight hours to assemble a gasoline engine. After establishing metrological work, ordinary young workers could assemble one in two hours. At present, some enterprise leaders do not pay enough attention to metrological work; some factories lack necessary measuring tools, and some factories have some measuring tools, but they have not been calibrated for a long time and are no longer accurate. This hinders the improvement of product quality and labor productivity to a certain extent.

The meeting decided to strengthen metrological work in the following aspects: First, establish unified metrological standards and carry out systematic transmission. In the case of insufficient instruments at present, adopt the method of decentralized establishment and unified control, with the metrological authorities as the main body, and utilize the strength of larger enterprises and universities. Second, establish a city-wide metrological network, mainly based on regions. The city will set up seventeen central metrology rooms and dozens of collaboration groups to carry out metrological work in a planned manner. Third, in addition to transmitting standards, each central metrology room must also go out of the metrology room, go deep into the workshop to serve production, and regularly verify and repair work card measuring tools to keep them accurate. Fourth, give play to the role of various grassroots metrology rooms. Enterprises that do not have metrological organizations but are suitable for establishing metrological organizations should quickly establish metrological organizations. (Shi Bo)

    搞好计量工作  确保产品质量
    国家计量局交流为机械工业服务的经验
    天津科技委员会从四方面加强计量工作
    据新华社武汉26日电　国家计量局最近在武汉召开会议，交流计量工作为机械工业服务的经验，要求各地迅速地全面开展计量工作，为提高机械工业产品质量和劳动生产率而奋斗。
    会议指出，随着我国工业和科学研究事业的发展，计量工作已经由原来管理商业用的度、量、衡，转向为国民经济建设服务，当前则以为工业服务为主。会议分析了计量工作在机械工业中所起的作用。指出机械工业无论设计、工艺、设备那一方面都要使用量具，而所使用的量具是否准确，所选择的量具是否适当，以及使用是否正确等，都属于计量工作的范围。
    目前各地迅速发展的机械工业中，部分中小工厂量具不够准确，有的由于保养不好生锈，刻度模糊不清，有的实际误差超出允许误差几倍，因而影响了产品质量。这些工厂迫切需要建立计量工作。一些基础较好、规模较大、已经建立计量室的工厂，随着产品向重型、大型、精密、尖端方向发展，也需要提高测量技术，开展计量的研究工作，进行更精密的计量。会议认为，当前机械工业中计量工作的主要方面是长度计量、如尺寸、角度、表面光洁度、同心度、平行性、平面性等的测量。其次是温度计量，特别是对翻砂质量有影响的铁水和浇铸温度的计量。
    会议认为，目前应当结合质量大检查和建立企业管理制度，尽快地把计量工作开展起来。首先把计量机构普遍建立起来。各工厂可以根据生产需要分别建立计量室、检定站或设专人管理这方面的工作。各省、市、自治区要建立计量传递系统，健全计量网。对于各地开展计量工作中必要的人员和设备，会议认为可以通过协作解决，由计量工作有基础的大型企业计量室帮助中小企业培训人员及提供一部分设备；同时组织运用各高等学校有关计量方面的力量。
    本报讯　为了更有效地提高工业产品的质量，提高劳动生产率，天津市科学技术委员会最近召开了计量和标准化工作会议。
    随着生产的发展，天津市的计量工作也发展了。由检定尺、秤等十来种器具，发展到能检定长度、力学、热工、电学四大类共二百五十多种量具计器。计量工作在生产中发挥了重要作用。例如，计量管理人员曾深入到张家口、保定、石家庄三地的小高炉群，帮助解决热工仪表近十种，促进了钢铁产量和质量的提高。天津市拖拉机厂在没有建立计量工作以前，五级技术以上的工人装一台汽油机需要四十八小时；建立计量工作以后，一般青工两小时就可以装一台。目前还有部分企业的领导人员，对计量工作重视不足；有些工厂缺乏必要的计量器具，有些工厂虽有些计量器具，但长期没有核检已不准确。这都在一定程度上妨碍着产品质量和劳动生产率的提高。
    会议确定从以下几个方面加强计量工作：第一，建立统一计量标准，开展系统传递。在目前仪器不足的情况下，采取分散建立统一掌握的办法，以计量主管部门为主，并运用较大企业和大专学校的力量。第二，建立全市性的计量网，以地区为主，全市共设十七个中心计量室和几十个协作组，有计划地进行计量工作。第三，各中心计量室除传递标准外，还必须走出计量室，深入车间为生产服务，定期检定和修理工卡量具，使其保持准确。第四，发挥各基层计量室的作用。一些没有计量组织而又适于建立计量组织的企业应迅速建立计量组织。　（史博）
