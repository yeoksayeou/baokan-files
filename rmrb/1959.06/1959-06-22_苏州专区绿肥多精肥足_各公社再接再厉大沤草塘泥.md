(Our Dispatch from Nanjing, June 21st) Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of green manure across 1.7 million mu. The total output of fresh grass reached 137 million dan, doubling last year's figure, with an average yield of 8,000 jin per mu, a 60% increase over last year. On average, each mu of paddy field in the entire prefecture can receive 2,000 jin of fresh green manure. Furthermore, communes and production teams are actively composting grass and pond mud on a large scale. The number of fertilizer pools in the region has increased from over 400,000 in the past to over 1 million, with a total of 920 million dan of grass and pond mud composted. This enables each of the 5 million mu of rice fields to receive over 150 dan of refined fertilizer per mu, an increase of over 20% compared to last year.

Green manure is a crucial source of fertilizer for Suzhou Prefecture. However, in previous years, the unit area yield of green manure had remained stagnant at around 1,000 to 2,000 jin, and the planted area was small, leaving large tracts of land fallow. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of grain and cotton, the prefecture expanded its green manure planting area to 1.3 million mu last year, with the yield per mu leaping to 5,000 jin. This year, it has further increased to 1.7 million mu. In terms of varieties and planting methods, 1.2 million mu of purple alfalfa (i.e., red clover) are planted in rice and cotton nursery areas, 500,000 mu of golden alfalfa (i.e., yellow clover) are planted along the Yangtze River and coastal areas, and 90,000 mu are intercropped with grass and wheat (or broad beans).

This year, green manure production in Suzhou Prefecture has implemented a series of advanced measures from planting to harvesting. The first step was to focus on three key aspects: superior seeds, dense planting, and early sowing. This year, a superior variety of purple alfalfa that is high-yielding for late rice was selected. Based on the saying “late in the Cold Dew season, grass dies with little surviving,” sowing was completed before the Cold Dew solar term. During sowing, dense and uniform planting was ensured, with the seeding rate for purple alfalfa increasing from 2-3 jin to about 6 jin, and for yellow alfalfa, 15 jin per mu. Narrow rows, staggered planting, and repeated sowing were implemented to ensure uniform seed distribution and continuous seedling emergence.

Cadres and the masses throughout the region have broken away from the old habit of simply planting and neglecting the crop, and instead managed it from start to finish. As soon as sowing was completed, all localities, based on the different conditions of rice and cotton intercropping, managed water levels during the seedling stage and promptly dredged ditches for drainage. In rice-growing areas such as Wujiang and Kunshan, drainage ditches were generally dredged and mud was excavated after the rice harvest, according to the field shape and topography, to ensure smooth drainage and prevent frost damage and root uprooting. In green manure intercropping areas in cotton-growing regions such as Taicang and Changshu, drought-resistant irrigation was generally carried out in a timely manner based on drought conditions to ensure timely seedling emergence. After seedling emergence, all localities generally implemented measures to increase fertilizer application to nourish the fertilizer crop, applying waste grass, cattle shed ash, plant ash, and garbage in winter to keep warm and prevent frost, and applying early spring fertilizer to promote seedling growth.

Planting green manure crops also plays a significant role in improving soil, adjusting crop rotations, and developing the breeding industry. The planting area of green manure crops in the Suzhou region accounts for about one-third of the cultivated land area. Every piece of land can be rotated with green manure once every three years to increase soil fertility. After the green manure is harvested, it is also conducive to early plowing and sun-drying, accelerating soil ripening, which is an important way to improve soil. Shengze Commune in Wujiang County has nearly 20,000 mu of low-lying fields with very poor soil structure, and the yield of rice per mu has only been 300-400 jin for many years. After cultivating green manure crops in the past two years, the soil fertility has generally improved, and the yield of rice per mu increased to more than 600 jin last year. This year, due to early planting and harvesting of green manure, and the appropriate expansion of the green manure planting area, the area of double-cropping early rice in the region has expanded from 150,000 mu last year to 430,000 mu, and early sowing and early transplanting have been achieved. In addition, green manure is also a good livestock feed. Fresh green manure can be directly fed to livestock, and after silage, it can be dried, chopped, and mixed with other feeds to feed livestock.

    苏州专区绿肥多精肥足
    各公社再接再厉大沤草塘泥
    本报南京21日电　江苏省苏州专区一百七十万亩绿肥空前丰收。鲜草总产量一亿三千七百万担，比去年翻一番，平均每亩八千斤，比去年增产60％。全专区的稻田平均每亩可以有鲜绿肥二千斤。各公社、生产队还大沤草塘泥。全区肥料潭由过去的四十多万个增加到一百多万个，共沤制草塘泥九亿二千多万担，使五百多万亩水稻每亩有精肥一百五十多担，比去年每亩所施精肥增加20％以上。
    绿肥是苏州专区的重要肥源之一，但是往年绿肥单位面积产量一直停留在一、二千斤左右，而且种的面积少，大片土地休闲。为了争取粮棉大丰收，去年全区绿肥种植面积扩大到一百三十万亩，亩产量猛跳到五千斤，今年又增加到一百七十万亩。在品种及种植方式上，今年稻、棉圃地区种紫云英（即红花草）一百二十万亩，沿江沿海一带种金花菜（即黄花草）五十万亩，此外还有草麦（或蚕豆）夹种九万亩。
    苏州专区今年绿肥生产从种到收贯彻了一系列先进措施。首先抓住了良种、密植、早播三个环节。今年选择了晚稻丰产紫云英良种，根据“寒露落草死多活少”的农谚，在寒露前播种结束。播种中做到密植匀播，紫云英播种量从二、三斤增加到六斤左右，黄花草每亩播种十五斤，并做到狭幅、分行、来回撒播、落种均匀，出苗成片。
    全区干部和群众打破历年来只种不管的旧习惯，从头管起，一管到底。播种一结束，各地都根据稻、棉田套种的不同的情况，做好苗期水浆管理，及时开沟排水。吴江、昆山等稻田地区在稻子收割后，普遍根据田形地势，也开好排水沟，挖好草泥，做到排水畅通，防止了冻害根拔现象。太仓、常熟等棉田套种绿肥地区普遍根据旱情及时进行抗旱润水，保证及时出苗。出苗以后，各地普遍贯彻了增施肥料以肥养肥的措施，冬季施用乱草屑、牛窝灰、草木灰和垃圾保暖防冻，早春普施提苗肥。
    种植绿肥作物对改良土壤、调整茬口、发展饲养业也有重大的作用。苏州地区绿肥作物种植面积约占耕地面积三分之一左右，每隔三年每块土地就可轮种绿肥一次，以增加地力。在绿肥收获后，又有利于及早进行耕翻晒垡，加速土壤的熟化，是改良土壤的重要途径。吴江县盛泽公社有近二万亩低洼田，土壤结构很差，历年水稻亩产量只有三、四百斤；近二年来耕种绿肥作物以后，土壤肥力普遍转好，去年水稻亩产量提高到六百多斤。今年由于绿肥种得早、收得早和适当扩大了绿肥种植面积，全区双季早稻从去年十五万亩扩大到四十三万亩，而且做到了早播早插。此外，绿肥还是很好的牲畜饲料，鲜绿肥可直接喂养牲畜，青储后晒干切碎与其他饲料拌和也可喂养牲畜。
