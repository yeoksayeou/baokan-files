Qingdao, June 18th (by our reporter) - Qingdao city, through deeply mobilizing the masses to engage in technical innovation and vigorously grasping converter steelmaking production, has pushed converter steelmaking production to a new stage. Since May, despite the low quality of pig iron, the city's production of first-grade steel has remained stable at around 80%; the daily steel production level has increased from about 100 tons in April to 649 tons; the converter furnace life has increased from more than ten heats to the current level of about fifty heats, with a maximum of 120 heats.

Qingdao originally used acidic converters and cupola furnaces for steelmaking. Because it was impossible to desulfurize inside the furnace, the sulfur content of the steel ingots was often very high, making them unsuitable for rolling or heat treatment; the daily production of steel ingots was only about 100 tons. In order to quickly reverse the backward situation of converter steelmaking production, the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) simultaneously deeply mobilized the masses to engage in technical innovation, vigorously breaking through the technical barriers of steelmaking, and changed all the city's acidic converters to alkaline converters and the acidic cupola furnaces to hot blast alkaline iron melting furnaces. Thanks to the importance attached by the leadership, in just over a month, all the city's steelmaking converters and iron melting furnaces were changed from acidic to alkaline, and preheated air supply method was adopted in the alkaline iron melting furnaces. Changing the converter steelmaking equipment to alkaline allows it to adapt to high-alkalinity slag desulfurization; the adoption of preheated air supply method in the alkaline iron melting furnace not only compensated for the heat loss caused by the excessive addition of slagging desulfurization materials, but also increased the temperature of the molten iron, promoting slagging desulfurization.

In adopting this new technology, various factories in Qingdao city encountered many technical and equipment difficulties. For example, the blowing process was too long and the blowing loss was too great. Faced with these difficulties, the leaders of some factories (workshops) wanted to change back and take the old road. After studying these situations, the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee believed that the direction of using alkaline converters for steelmaking was correct; if the direction is correct, we must persist to the end; the difficulties in operation can be solved by mobilizing the masses. After mobilization, all converter steelmaking workers in the city, focusing on solving the key issues of extending furnace life technology, quickly launched a major debate and a vigorous technical revolution. After more than a month of hard work, various factories successively adopted methods such as rational batching and improving furnace building methods, so that the furnace life was extended from a few heats to more than ten heats, or even dozens of heats.

While reforming the equipment, various factories in the city also adopted lime instead of part of limestone for in-furnace slagging desulfurization. This method not only ensured sufficient desulfurization, but also overcame the shortcomings of furnace temperature drop caused by simply using limestone for slagging desulfurization, thereby improving melting efficiency. At present, the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee is further taking measures to strengthen the technical management and production management of converter production, strictly implement the systems of inspection and testing, batching, and "slag blocking" when taking steel, requiring that first-grade steel reaches more than 90% in June, and eliminating third-grade steel. In addition, while improving quality, it is also necessary to take timely measures such as checking furnace lining life, improving blowing technology, adopting large air volume, high air temperature, and further improving iron melting furnace efficiency to further improve steelmaking production.

### 提高铁水温度　促进造渣脱硫　保证转炉出好钢  青岛采用碱性热风化铁炉

    提高铁水温度　促进造渣脱硫　保证转炉出好钢
    青岛采用碱性热风化铁炉
    本报青岛18日电　青岛市通过深入发动群众大闹技术革新，狠抓转炉炼钢生产，把转炉炼钢生产推上了一个新阶段。5月份以来，尽管生铁质量较低，全市生产的一级钢仍然稳定在80％左右；钢的日产水平由4月的一百吨左右提高到六百四十九吨；转炉炉龄由十余炉次提高到目前的五十炉次左右，最高达到一百二十炉次。
    青岛市原来采用酸性转炉和冲天炉炼钢，由于无法进行炉内脱硫，钢锭含硫率往往很高，既不能轧制，又不能进行热处理；日产钢锭只有一百吨左右。为了迅速扭转转炉炼钢生产的落后局面，中共青岛市委一面深入发动群众，大闹技术革新，大破炼钢技术关，一面把全市的酸性转炉改为碱性转炉，把酸性冲天炉改为热风碱性化铁炉。由于领导的重视，只一个多月时间，全市所有的炼钢转炉和化铁炉，就都由酸性改为碱性，并且在碱性化铁炉上采用了预热送风法。转炉炼钢设备改为碱性，就能适应高碱度的渣子脱硫；碱性化铁炉采用预热送风法，不但弥补了因过多加入造渣脱硫料而损失的热量，而且还提高了铁水温度，促进了造渣脱硫。
    青岛市各厂在采用这一新技术中，曾经遇到许许多多技术上、设备上的困难。如吹炼过程太长，吹损过大，面对这些困难，部分厂（车间）的领导便想再改回去，走老路。青岛市委在研究了这些情况后，认为采用碱性转炉炼钢方向是肯定的；方向对头就要坚持干到底；操作中的困难，发动群众是可以解决的。经过动员以后，全市转炉炼钢职工，针对解决延长炉龄技术的关键问题，迅速展开大辩论，大闹技术革命。经过一个多月的奋战，各厂先后采用合理配料、改进砌炉方法等办法，使炉龄由几炉次延长到十几炉次，乃至几十炉次。
    在改革设备的同时，全市各厂还采用了石灰代替部分石灰石来进行炉内造渣脱硫。这种办法既保证了脱硫充分，又克服了由于单纯采用石灰石造渣脱硫而带来的炉温下降的缺点，进而提高了熔化效率。目前中共青岛市委正在进一步采取措施加强转炉生产的技术管理和生产管理，严格执行检查化验、配料、取钢时“挡渣”等制度，一级钢在6月份要求达到90％以上，消灭三级钢。此外，在提高质量的同时，还要及时采取检查炉衬寿命，改进吹炼技术，采用大风量、高风温和进一步提高化铁炉效率等措施，进一步提高炼钢生产。（毕万兆）（附图片）
