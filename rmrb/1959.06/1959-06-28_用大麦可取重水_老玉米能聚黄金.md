    Extracting Heavy Water with Barley
    Gathering Gold with Old Corn
    Heavy water contains a special form of hydrogen called deuterium. People use heavy water as a neutron moderator in atomic energy devices. Heavy water can be obtained from ordinary water with the help of electric current. However, to obtain a certain amount of heavy water, a lot of electrical energy must be consumed. Swedish scientists Carlbom, Skedbrand, and Nilsson have proven that heavy water can be extracted using barley. It turns out that barley does not "like" heavy water. When brewing beer, barley is soaked in water beforehand. When barley absorbs ordinary water, it does not absorb heavy water at all. Therefore, by soaking batches of barley in the same water, the seeds will absorb all the ordinary water, leaving behind the heavy water. This interesting method may be used to produce heavy water in the future.
    The work of Czechoslovak scientists exhibited at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair proved that the roots of corn can select gold from the soil. Chemists have calculated that on average, one million kilograms of soil contains one-tenth of a gram of gold. It's just that this gold is very dispersed on the Earth's surface. However, Czechoslovak scientists have discovered that corn can collect this gold dispersed on the Earth. Who knows, after some time, using corn to attract gold from the Earth may become a beneficial reality?! (Yǔwén)

    用大麦可取重水
    老玉米能聚黄金
    重水含有一种特殊形式的氢，叫做重氢。人们利用重水作为原子能装置中的中子减速器之用。重水可以利用普通的水通过电流帮助来取得。但是，想要取得一定量的重水，必须消耗很多的电能。瑞典科学家卡尔博姆、斯克德布兰和尼尔逊却证明了可以利用大麦来取得重水。原来，大麦不“喜欢”重水。人们在酿啤酒时，都是事先把大麦浸到水中。大麦在吸收普通的水时，它完全不吸收重水。因此，把一批一批的大麦浸到同一水中，种子就会把普通水全部吸完，而留下重水。这种有趣的方法，今后可能会被用来制造重水。
    1958年布鲁塞尔举行的世界展览会上展出的捷克斯洛伐克科学家的著作证明，玉蜀黍的根能从土壤中挑选黄金。化学家计算出，平均每一百万公斤的土壤就有十分之一公分重的黄金。只不过这些黄金在地球表面很分散。可是，捷克斯洛伐克科学家却发现了玉蜀黍能收集这些分散到地球上的黄金。谁知道，再过一些时候，利用玉蜀黍来吸引地球上的黄金是否会成了有益的真事呢？！　（宇文）
