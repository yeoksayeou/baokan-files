    Progress in Polypeptide Synthesis Chemistry
    The recently published "Beijing University (Natural Science) Journal" (Quarterly), Volume 5, Issue 2, published a report from the Biochemistry Department of the university on the "Synthesis of Oxytocin." The report states that they repeated the synthesis of oxytocin to expand research on the structure, function, and synthesis of polypeptides and proteins. The synthesis method was basically based on Boissonnas' method, but some changes were made in the synthesis steps and operating methods. During the synthesis process, due to improvements in operating methods, the yields of some intermediate products, such as N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucyl-glycine ethyl ester, γ-L-glutamic acid methyl ester HCl, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-glutaminyl-L-asparaginyl-S-benzyl-L-cysteine methyl ester, etc., exceeded those recorded in the literature. Regarding the synthesis of oxytocin, literature shows that four countries have found methods for synthesis. In recent years, the progress of international research on polypeptide synthesis methods has been rapid. In addition to oxytocin, some polypeptides with important biological activities, such as hemalgogen, gramicidin S, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, etc., have been artificially synthesized. Therefore, it can be envisioned that the progress of polypeptide synthesis chemistry will eventually lead to the emergence of artificially synthesized proteins, which the scientific community has been seeking for a long time. (Note: The Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also synthesized oxytocin last year. Artificially synthesized oxytocin, that is, pure oxytocin, is an excellent drug for inducing labor in pregnant women with pregnancy poisoning. It does not have the side effect of increasing the blood pressure of pregnant women, while the natural oxytocin generally used before the artificial synthesis of oxytocin has the unfavorable side effect of increasing the blood pressure of pregnant women. Therefore, the success of oxytocin synthesis has great practical value for obstetrical medicine alone.)

    多肽合成化学的进展
    最近出版的“北京大学（自然科学）学报”（季刊）五卷二期，发表了该校生物化学教研室关于“催产素的合成”的报告。报告说，他们为展开关于多肽和蛋白质的结构、功能和合成的研究，重复了催产素的合成。合成的方法，基本上是根据Boissonnas的方法，但在合成步骤和操作方法上作了一些更改。在合成过程中，由于操作方法上的改进，使一些中间产物，例如，N—苄氧羰酰—L—亮氨酰—甘氨酸乙酯，γ—L—谷氨酸甲酯HCI，N—苄氧羰酰—L—谷氨酰胺酰—L—门冬酰胺酰—S—苄基—L—半胱氨酸甲酯等，在产率上超过了文献的记载。关于催产素的合成，已见文献的已有四个国家找到了合成的方法。近年来，国际上研究多肽合成方法的进展很快，除了催产素外，一些具有重要生物活性的多肽，例如，加血质素、短杆菌环肽S、α黑色细胞激素等都已分别由人工合成了。因此，可以设想，多肽合成化学的进展，终将导致科学界长期探求的人工合成蛋白质的出现。（注：中国科学院上海生物化学研究所去年也合成了催产素。人工合成催产素，即纯催产素，是孕娠中毒产妇引产用的良药，它没有增加产妇血压的副作用，而在人工合成的催产素产生以前，一般使用的天然催产素则有不利于产妇的增加血压的副作用。因此，催产素合成的成功，仅仅对产科医药来说，就有很大的实用价值。）
