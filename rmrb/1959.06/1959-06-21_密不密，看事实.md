When I was little, I went to the slope with my older brother to hoe sweet potatoes. He hoed the ground, and I turned the vines, bending over to pick up the weeds, afraid that the big weeds wouldn't dry out easily and would come back to life if it rained. As he hoed, my brother told me some farming experiences. He said, "If you want sweet potatoes to grow well, you have to make wide ridges and apply more manure." Then, he sang the agricultural proverb, "Wide ridges, more manure, I don't believe the sweet potatoes will fail" without thinking.

My brother was three years older than me, and he couldn't have summarized such a refined proverb himself. I knew he got it from Wang Shouxin, an old farming expert from the neighboring village, who was also our neighbor. Wang Shouxin's crops were indeed growing well, much better than my family's and a few other families'.

These were all things from a long time ago. Later, I left home and didn't do farm work, so I gradually forgot these words.

Last spring, when planting melons, I happened to go home and my brother talked to me about production in the commune, saying, "Everything is good, but in my old eyes, the sweet potatoes are definitely planted too densely. You know, in the past, we planted four seedlings per hole, but this year we planted seven or eight!" He was the production team leader, and his words probably reflected the opinions of some commune members. I said, "Break the old habits!" Although I said that, I also felt that it was a bit dense. When I went home again in the fall, my mother greeted me, pointing to a pile of sweet potatoes in the yard outside the door that looked like a mountain, and said with a smile, "Look! The sweet potatoes are a great harvest." My brother also said, beaming, "Hey! Guaranteed enough to eat for two years." But they only praised the harvest and seemed to have forgotten about the dense planting, neither praising nor criticizing it.

But when it came to planting wheat, my brother said again, "A lot of wheat seeds were sown! One mu [unit of area] is more than two mu in previous years." I didn't say anything. This spring, when the wheat was jointing, he sometimes came from the countryside and still shook his head and said, "Too dense, too dense." It seemed that he was very worried about the wheat harvest.

Recently, when I went out on business and passed by my hometown, I stopped by to visit my family. I saw that the slopes were indeed a good wheat field! In May, the wheat was growing vigorously under the sun, tall and dense, shiny and oily black, truly swaying from one end to the other. But when I went home and praised the good wheat field to my older brother, he still said, "The wheat is good, but it's too dense, and the ears probably won't grow big." But I saw with my own eyes that the ears of wheat were not small. By the time of the wheat harvest, even a blind person would say that the wheat harvest was stable. Coincidentally, I met him again in the district, where he was attending a four-level cadre meeting. When he saw me, he said, "The wheat is about to be harvested, and I'll definitely be busy to death. I've been selected as the village's wheat harvest custodian!" At that time, I laughed secretly to myself, thinking that he would definitely be tacitly acknowledging the benefits of dense planting in his praise of the harvest.

That is to say, reasonable "density" is good. In constant practice, people—like countless farmers like my brother—will gradually break away from old ideas and old habits, recognize it, and accept it.

But I did see excessively dense planting, where the crops grew into wheat fields where "ten ears topped one ear, and nine sticks were earned in vain," which reduced production and aroused the masses' suspicion about the harvest from dense planting. I also saw that in a production brigade with little fertilizer, the cadres emphasized dense planting, and the commune members secretly turned dense planting into sparse planting. But can this blame the reduction in production on dense planting? Dialectics tells us that everything is mutually restricted and interdependent with the things around it. One-sided emphasis on density, water, and fertilizer, without proper management, will cause a thin harvest due to excessive density, which turns it from reasonable to absurd. Therefore, the denser it is, the worse it is. Therefore, in cultivation, it is necessary to promote the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture, and not the One-Character or Two-Character Constitution, such as the "Density" Constitution or the "Water" Constitution. Moreover, even the Eight-Character Constitution must be adapted to local conditions and times, and respect long-term practical experience. On this basis, reasonable dense planting can be expected to achieve a good harvest. Such experience is very useful to us!

    密不密，看事实
    张凤仪
    小时，我跟哥哥一起上坡，锄地瓜。他锄地，我就翻蔓，我边翻蔓边弯腰捡草，怕大草不容易晒死、遇雨再活了。哥哥边锄边讲些农活上的经验给我听。他说：“地瓜要长好、就得宽打垅、多施粪。”随着，顺口就唱出“宽打垅、多施粪、瞎了地瓜我不信”的农谚来。
    哥哥比我大三岁，他还总结不出这样洗炼的谚语来，我知道他这是从邻村王家，又同我们是地邻，一个老庄稼把式王守信趸来的。王守信家的庄稼确是长得好，比起俺家，还有别的几家，都是拔顶子的。
    这都是许久以前的事了，后来我离开家，不作农活，这些话也就渐次忘却了。
    去年春暮栽瓜时，我偶尔回家一趟，哥哥和我谈起社里生产时候说：“什么都好，依我的老眼光看地瓜肯定是密了。你知道过去一脱栽四棵，今年栽七八棵呢？”他是生产小队长，他的话恐怕反映了部分社员的意见。我说：“打破旧习惯吧！”话虽这样说，但心里也感到密些。秋后我又回家，母亲迎着我，指着门外场院中一堆像山也似的地瓜笑着说：“你看啊！地瓜收个大海。”哥哥也眉飞色舞的说：“咳！管保够两年吃的。”但他们都只管夸丰收，却好像忘记密植的事了，没褒它也没贬它。
    但提到种麦子，哥哥却又说：“麦种播的多啊！一亩比上往年二亩。”我没作声。今春小麦拔节时，他有时从乡间来，还不时摇头说：“密了、太密了”，看来他是多么耽心着麦收。
    最近，我因事外出路过家乡时，顺脚弯到家去望望。我望见遍坡确是一片好麦田啊！5月，麦子在太阳底下蓬勃地生长着，又高又密，油黑闪亮的，真是拥拥这头，那头晃动。但当我到家和大哥夸起这坡好麦田时，他还说：“麦子是好，可惜太密，穗恐怕长不大。”但我亲眼见麦穗并不小。到了麦收前，连瞎子也说小麦丰收是稳定了，可巧我又在区上碰到他，他是来参加四级干部会的，见了我他就说：“要收麦了，我一定会忙得要死，我被选为全村麦收保管员呢！”当时，我在暗地里笑，心想他一定又要在夸丰收中默认密植的好处了。
    这就是说合理的“密”是好的，在不断实践中，人们——像无数我哥哥这样的农民，会逐渐摆脱旧观念，旧习惯，认识了它，接受了它。
    但我也确看到密植过度，庄稼长成“十穗顶一穗，干赚九根棍”的麦田，庄稼减了产，引起了群众对密植丰收的怀疑。我也看到一个生产大队的肥料少，但干部却强调密植，社员偷偷将密植变成稀植的。但难道这能够把减产的罪名归罪于密植吗？辩证法告诉我们任何事物，都与它周围的事物，互相制约，互相依存，片面强调密、水、肥，管理跟不上，密到会造成薄收，便由合理变成了荒谬，为此，越密就越不好。因此，在耕作方面，一定要推广八字宪法，不能是一字或二字宪法，例如“密”的宪法，或“水”的宪法，而且就是八字宪法，也要因地制宜，因时制宜，尊重长期实践的经验，在这种基础上去进行合理的密植，才可望获得丰收。这样的经验，对我们是大有用处的啊！
