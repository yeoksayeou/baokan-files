Common Medical Knowledge

    Hormones
    Some chemical substances, secreted from one part of the body and transported through the blood to another part, have the effect of stimulating or inhibiting, thereby promoting the body's activity or growth. These chemical substances are called hormones. Many parts of the body produce hormones, such as the anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland, the parathyroid gland, the medulla and cortex of the adrenal gland, the pancreas, the ovaries, the testes, and the placenta, each secreting different hormones. Most adrenal cortical hormones and sex hormones are produced by chemical synthesis, while other hormones are mostly extracted from "scraps" of meat processing by-products, hence they are also called organ preparations.
    
    Antibiotics
    In nature, in water, air, and soil, there are countless tiny microorganisms, many of which are extremely harmful pathogenic bacteria to human health. However, some microorganisms can secrete certain chemical substances that inhibit or eliminate the growth of microorganisms. These chemical substances are antibiotics.
    
    The use of antibiotics as drugs to treat diseases only began in 1941. Although the antibiotic industry does not have a long history, it occupies a leading position in the modern pharmaceutical industry. Currently, commonly used antibiotics include penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, aureomycin, terramycin, tetracycline, and more than a dozen others. They can effectively treat many infectious diseases that were difficult to treat in the past, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, plague, typhoid fever, typhus, relapsing fever, pertussis, trachoma, bacillary dysentery, peritonitis, and meningitis. Feeding piglets and chicks with terramycin or aureomycin can promote growth and prevent diseases. Some antibiotics can stimulate plant growth and prevent plant diseases. Antibiotics can also be used for food preservation.
    
    Sulfonamides
    The successful research of sulfonamide drugs in 1935 was a landmark event in medical history. With it, mankind has achieved a decisive victory in the long-term struggle against bacterial infectious diseases.
    
    Now, after testing, there are no fewer than five thousand kinds of sulfonamide derivatives. Among them, those with great efficacy, low toxicity, and have been mass-produced and used include sulfanilamide, sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine, sulfathioureylene and more than a dozen others. Sulfonamide drugs have a wide range of treatments and are very effective for various suppurative diseases, pneumonia, meningitis, gonorrhea, dysentery, etc.
    
    Cycloserine
    Cycloserine is a newly discovered chemically synthesized antibiotic in the world. It has a high inhibitory effect on tubercle bacilli. This drug is made from sericine, a high-grade raw material extracted from the waste left over from silk reeling.

    医药常识
    激素
    有一些化学物质，从体内一部分分泌出来，通过血液输送到另外的部分去发生激发或约制的作用，从而促进机体的活动或生长，这些化学物质便叫作激素。体内产生激素的部位很多，例如脑垂体的前叶和后叶、甲状腺、副甲状腺、肾上腺的髓质和皮质部分、胰脏、卵巢、睪丸和胎盘等都各有不同的激素分泌出来。肾上腺皮质激素和性激素等绝大部分用化学合成方法生产，其它激素则多是由肉类加工副产的“下脚”中提取出来的，因此又叫作脏器制剂。
    抗菌素
    在大自然中的水、空气、土壤中，存在着无数细小的微生物，有许多是对人类健康极其有害的病原菌，但是也有一些微生物能够分泌出某种化学物质，具有抑制或消灭微生物生长的作用，这种化学物质就是抗菌素。
    利用抗菌素作为药物治疗疾病从一九四一年才开始，抗菌素工业虽然历史不长，但在近代医药工业中占有首要的地位，目前常用的抗菌素有青霉素、链霉素、合霉素、金霉素，土霉素、四囨素等十多种，它们能够有效地治疗许多过去不易治疗的传染性疾病，如肺炎、结核病、梅毒、麻疯、鼠疫、伤寒、斑疹伤寒、回归热、百日咳、砂眼、赤痢、腹膜炎、脑膜炎等。用土霉素或金霉素喂仔猪、雏鸡，可以促进生长并能预防疾病，某些抗菌素能够刺激植物的生长，并防治植物病害。抗菌素还可用于食物防腐。
    磺胺
    磺胺药物一九三五年研究成功，这是医疗史上一件具有划时代意义的事。有了它，人类长期来和细菌性传染疾病的斗争才取得了决定性的胜利。
    现在经过试验的各种磺胺衍生物不下五千余种，其中疗效大、毒性小、已经大量生产使用的有磺胺、磺胺噻唑、磺胺嘧啶，磺胺甲基嘧啶，磺胺二甲基嘧啶，磺胺?等十多种。磺胺药物的治疗范围很广，对各种化脓性疾病、肺炎、脑膜炎、淋病、痢疾等都很有效。
    囨丝氨酸
    囨丝氨酸是世界上新近发现的化学合成抗菌素，它对结核病菌有高度的抑制作用。这种药是从缫丝剩下的废料中提出来的高级原料——丝氨酸制成的。
