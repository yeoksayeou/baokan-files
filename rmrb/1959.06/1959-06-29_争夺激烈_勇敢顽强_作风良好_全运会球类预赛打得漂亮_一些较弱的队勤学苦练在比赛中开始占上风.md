Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: (Reported by our correspondent) The first National Games' preliminary rounds for soccer, basketball, volleyball, handball, baseball, and softball have all concluded. The preliminary rounds lasted a month, from May 27th to June 27th. Among the more than 3,000 athletes participating in the preliminary rounds, representing over twenty ethnic groups, a total of 214 teams of various kinds were formed. They held 559 round-robin matches in twenty cities across the country, attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators. This was a grand review of the strength of these six ball sports in our country.

Many newcomers, high spirits, and fierce competition were the prominent features of this preliminary round. The majority of the more than 3,000 male and female athletes participating in the competition were around twenty years old, many of whom were participating in such a large-scale national ball game competition for the first time. They were both courageous and tenacious, and had good sportsmanship. The technical level of teams from various regions has also generally improved, so in many games, it was difficult to determine the outcome in the last few minutes or even seconds. Some games were so closely contested until the end that they had to go into overtime or end in a tie.

From the soccer matches, which started earliest in the preliminary round, it can be seen that young athletes from all over the country are making great strides. The twenty-seven soccer teams participating in the preliminary round engaged in seventy-nine fierce matches, with five ending in ties and twenty-seven with a score difference of only one or two goals. It was difficult to predict the winner in many games beforehand. For example, in the final battle of the Zhengzhou competition zone, the Hubei team, which ranked fourth in last year's national soccer League B, actually defeated the Liaoning team, the runner-up of last year's League A, by a score of two to one, winning the championship of this competition zone with a record of five wins and no losses.

The basketball preliminary round had the most participating teams, with a total of fifty-eight teams (twenty-nine male and twenty-nine female), and the competition was the fiercest. Cases of newcomers defeating veterans continued to occur. The Guangdong men's team, which was just promoted from League C to League B last year, performed the most outstandingly in the competition. Their two games against the top-tier Beijing and Jiangsu men's teams were extremely close. In the Harbin competition zone, the Shanxi team, which ranked third in League B last year, also defeated the Guangdong team, which ranked fourth in League A last year, by a score of seventy to sixty-nine, winning second place in this competition zone. The young Xinjiang team, although unable to qualify for the finals, also won against the Heilongjiang and Ningxia teams, and only lost to the Guangdong team by five points. The Liaoning team, the champion of League B last year, and the Anhui team, the runner-up, suffered repeated defeats in the competition, and were "eliminated" and failed to qualify for the finals. These situations show that some originally weaker teams, due to ideological emancipation, diligent study and hard practice, and full exploitation of their strengths, posed a great threat to strong teams and even defeated them.

Another gratifying situation in the basketball preliminary round is that the athletes participating in the competition not only generally had strong physiques, but also many young "tall players" emerged. The Guangdong men's team and the Jilin men's team both had a towering center forward with a height of two meters and two centimeters. In the Harbin competition zone, there were twenty-four male players with a height of over one meter and ninety centimeters, and sixteen female players with a height of over one meter and seventy-five centimeters. The increase in these "tall players" has also made the offensive and defensive tactics of basketball more diversified.

The number of teams participating in the volleyball preliminary rounds was second only to basketball, with a total of fifty-one teams (twenty-seven male and twenty-four female), and each team was strong and well-equipped. Several nationally renowned volleyball teams have also been severely threatened by rising stars. For example, in the Jinan competition zone, the famous People's Liberation Army men's team won against the little-known Guizhou men's team by a score of three to two after five rounds of fierce competition. In the Nanchang competition zone, the game between the Guangdong men's team, the runner-up of League A last year with six athletes, and the Jiangxi team, which ranked ninth in League A last year, also went through five rounds, with the Guangdong team winning by a score of three to two.

The ball sports of male and female handball, male baseball, and female softball have only been widely developed in our country in the past one or two years. However, the number of teams participating in the competition this time has increased several times compared to previous national competitions. Among them, handball has a total of thirty-five teams (fifteen male and twenty female), male baseball has a total of twenty-three teams, and female softball has a total of twenty teams. The individual technical and collective tactical levels of the athletes of many teams have also been significantly improved.

This preliminary round also showed that the development of technical levels among teams in various regions is not balanced enough, and some differences are still relatively large. Some athletes' physical strength is also not good enough, so in the final few minutes, which are of decisive significance, they often lose due to the failure to fully exert their technical level, resulting in a reversal of victory; some teams also suffer defeat due to insufficient experience, improper tactical application, or failure to adapt to changing circumstances. People believe that, with the spirit of "not being arrogant in victory and not being discouraged in defeat," athletes and coaches from all over the country will continue to train hard and will soon be able to further improve the level of these ball sports in our country.

    争夺激烈　勇敢顽强　作风良好
    全运会球类预赛打得漂亮
    一些较弱的队勤学苦练在比赛中开始占上风
    据新华社28日讯　本社记者报道：第一届全国运动会的足、篮、排、手、棒、垒球分区预赛，已经全部结束了。预赛从5月27日到6月27日共举行了一个月。参加预赛的三千多名运动员中，包括二十多个民族，共组成了二百一十四个各类球队，他们在全国二十个城市举行了五百五十九场循环比赛，吸引了几十万名观众。这是我国对这六项球类实力的一次盛大检阅。
    新手多、干劲足、争夺激烈，是这次预赛的突出特点。参加比赛的三千多名男、女运动员，年龄大多在二十岁左右，其中许多人还是第一次参加这么大规模的全国性球类比赛。他们既勇敢顽强，又具有良好的体育运动道德作风。各地球队技术水平也普遍有所提高，因此许多场比赛在最后几分钟甚至几秒钟内，还很难分出胜负，有些比赛直到终场时，还打得难解难分，最后不得不延长时间再战或以平局来结束战斗。
    从预赛开始最早的足球赛中，可以看出各地年轻的运动员们正在大步前进。参加预赛的二十七个足球队经过七十九场激烈的争夺，有五场踢成平局，有二十七场双方得分只相差一球或两球。许多场比赛胜负属谁，事先都很难预测。例如在郑州竞赛区的最后一战中，去年全国足球乙级队联赛第四名湖北队，竟以二比一战胜了去年甲级队亚军辽宁队，以五战五胜的纪录赢得了这个竞赛区的冠军。
    参加篮球预赛的球队最多，共有五十八队（男、女各二十九队），争夺也最激烈，新手战胜老手的情况不断出现。去年刚由丙级队升为乙级队的广东男子队，在比赛中表现最为出色。他们同全国第一流水平的北京和江苏男子队的两场比赛，竟打得难解难分。在哈尔滨竞赛区，去年乙级队第三名山西队也以七十比六十九战胜了去年甲级队第四名广东队，获得这个竞赛区的第二名。年轻的新疆队虽然没能取得决赛权，但他们也赢了黑龙江队、宁夏队，而且只输给广东队五分。去年乙级队冠军辽宁队、亚军安徽队，在比赛中竟连吃败仗，以致被“淘汰”而没能取得决赛权。这些情况说明：一些原来比较弱的队由于思想解放，勤学苦练，充分发挥了自己的特长，因而给强队很大威胁，甚至战胜了强队。
    篮球预赛中，另一个可喜的情况是：参加比赛的运动员不但一般体质较强，而且出现了许多年轻的“高个子”。广东男子队和吉林男子队中，都拥有一名身高两公尺零二公分的高大中锋。哈尔滨竞赛区，男子队中有二十四人身高一公尺九十公分以上，女子队中有十六人身高一公尺七十五公分以上。这些“高个子”的增多，也使得篮球运动的攻守战术向更多样化的方向发展了。
    参加排球分区预赛的球队队数仅次于篮球队，共有五十一个队（男二十七队、女二十四队），队队兵强马壮。其中几个全国闻名的排球队也遭到了后起之秀的严重威胁。例如在济南竞赛区，著名的解放军男子队经过五局的激烈争夺，才以三比二赢了不大闻名的贵州男子队。在南昌竞赛区，去年甲级队亚军、拥有六名运动健将的广东男子队，同去年甲级队第九名江西队的比赛，也是经过五局争夺，广东队才以三比二获胜的。
    男、女手球和男子棒球、女子垒球这几项球类运动，是最近一两年内才在我国普遍开展的。但这次参加比赛的球队，已比往年举行全国性比赛时增加了好几倍。其中手球共有三十五个队（男十五队、女二十队），男子棒球共有二十三队，女子垒球共有二十队。许多球队运动员的个人技术和集体战术水平，也有了显著提高。
    这次预赛另外显示了各地球队之间的技术水平发展还不够平衡，有的相差还比较悬殊，有些运动员的体力也还不够好，因而在具有决定性意义的最后几分钟，常常因为技术水平不能充分发挥，以致反胜为败；有些球队也因为经验不够丰富，以致战术运用不当或者不能随机应变，而遭到了败局。人们相信：各地运动员和教练员本着“胜不骄、败不馁”的精神，继续刻苦锻练，将能很快地进一步提高我国这些球类运动的水平。
