The Jiangxi Provincial Classical Opera Troupe has begun performing excellent repertory of Gan Opera Yiyang Tune in Beijing. Yiyang Tune, one of China's oldest operas, has been inherited, enriched, and developed, and now appears before the capital's audience with a brand-new look.

On the evening of the 5th, the first performance was "The Return of the Soul". This play is adapted from the famous work "The Peony Pavilion" by the great Ming Dynasty playwright Tang Xianzu. As the curtain slowly rose, the young actors on the stage showed their skills, performing "Chunxiang's School Pranks", "A Dream in the Garden" ... scene after scene in a tight and orderly fashion. Singing and dancing, clean and crisp. People could hear the unique style of Yiyang Tune's combination of a cappella singing, repeated phrases, chorus, percussion accompaniment, and orchestral accompaniment. The actors delicately portrayed the resentment and passion of young men and women under feudal constraints, with a strong romantic color. The traditional Yiyang Tune repertory "Yuchi Gong" and "The Pearl Shirt" will also be performed in the capital one after another. "Yuchi Gong" has the bold and unrestrained characteristics of Yiyang Tune, expressing Yuchi Gong's heroic spirit of patriotism and integrity. "The Pearl Shirt", which is known for its beautiful and elegant lyrics that are easy to understand, was filmed into a movie by Shanghai Tianma Film Studio last year. Yiyang Tune has quite a few repertoires, and more than 100 kinds of musical tunes have been excavated.

Yiyang Tune originated in Yiyang, Jiangxi, and has a long history of more than 400 years, and has indirectly influenced the development of many operas. It has nourished and influenced Kunqu Opera, and for hundreds of years, Yiyang Tune has been circulating among the people, maintaining its bold, simple, popular, and flexible folk colors. In the decades before liberation, Yiyang Tune was ravaged and withered, and only a part of the repertory was preserved in Gan Opera. After liberation, this withering artistic flower regained its splendor and became the main vocal tune of the current Gan Opera. Great achievements have been made in excavation, arrangement, research, and improvement, and new successors have been cultivated. (Attached pictures)

    古老的弋阳戏重放异采
    江西省古典戏曲演出团，开始在北京公演赣剧弋阳腔的优秀剧目。我国最古老的戏曲之一——弋阳腔，在继承、丰富、发展后，以崭新的姿态呈现在首都观众面前。
    5日晚首先演出的是“还魂记”。这出戏是根据明代大剧作家汤显祖的名作“牡丹亭”改编的。帷幕徐启，舞台上的青年演员大显身手，“春香闹学”、“游园惊梦”……一场场紧凑地表演着。载歌载舞，干净利落。人们可以听到弋阳腔干唱、重句、帮腔、锣鼓伴唱和管弦伴唱相结合的独具风格的唱腔。演员们细腻地刻划着在封建束缚下青年男女的幽怨与激情，具有浓厚的浪漫主义色彩。弋阳腔的传统剧目“尉迟恭”、“珍珠记”等，也将陆续在首都演出。“尉迟恭”具有弋阳腔豪放粗犷的特色，表现尉迟恭赤心爱国正气凛然的英雄气概。以唱词优美清雅、通俗易懂见长的“珍珠记”，去年曾由上海天马电影制片厂摄制成电影。弋阳腔的保留剧目颇多，已经发掘的曲牌有一百多种。
    弋阳腔发源于江西弋阳，有四百年以上的悠久历史，对许多剧种的发展都有过间接影响。它与昆曲互相滋养、影响，几百年来弋阳腔一直流传在民间，保持着豪放、朴素、通俗、灵活的民间色彩。解放前几十年间，弋阳腔受到摧残而雕零，仅有一部分剧目保存在赣剧里，解放后，这朵垂萎的艺术花朵重新放出它的异彩，成为目前赣剧的主要声腔，在发掘、整理、研究、提高方面做出很大成绩，并培养出新的接班人。（附图片）
