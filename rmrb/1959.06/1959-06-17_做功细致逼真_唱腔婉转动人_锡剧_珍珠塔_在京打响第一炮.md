Careful and Realistic Performance, Moving and Melodious Singing
Xiju Opera "Pearl Tower" Makes a Successful Debut in Beijing

　　(Our newspaper reporter Zhu Jigong reported) Good news continues to pour in to Beijing's "garden of a hundred flowers." The Wuxi City Xiju Opera Troupe has brought audiences wonderful Xiju opera performances with a southern folk flavor. From the 13th, they premiered the excellent traditional drama "Pearl Tower," and from the 16th, they also performed "Meng Lijun."

　　"Pearl Tower" is a widely circulated folk tale in the Jiangnan region. It depicts the story of the down-on-his-luck scholar Fang Qing, who travels thousands of miles to Xiangyang to seek help from his aunt, Fang Duohua. However, this snobbish wife of the Imperial Censor does not consider their family ties and instead mocks and insults Fang Qing, driving him away. Later, Fang Qing becomes the top scholar in the imperial examinations, and the Imperial Censor's wife has no choice but to fulfill her vow: "If my nephew becomes a high-ranking official, I will carry a tray of incense weighing eighteen pounds on my head and greet Fang Qing with three steps and one bow." The comedy then comes to an end.

　　In this play, each actor is able to showcase their strengths. The actor Wang Binbin, who plays Fang Qing, has excellent stage presence. In the "falling snow" scene, he uses intricate movements such as broken steps, circling the stage, sliding steps, and sitting falls to meticulously portray Fang Qing's tragic and sentimental mood as he is robbed of the pearl tower by bandits and encounters the coldest days of winter on his journey from his aunt's house. The long passages of singing in this scene, primarily in the Huang tune and Dalu tune, are moving and melodious, with a pure and rich flavor. Locally, Wang Binbin's singing art is very popular with the masses and has formed a style known as "Binbin tune." The actress Wang Yunzhi portrays the snobbish and mean Fang Duohua in a vivid and lifelike manner. Fang Duohua boasts to guests and even maids about how glorious and wealthy her maiden family is, exaggerating and feigning generosity. However, when the ragged nephew Fang Qing asks her for help, the actress expresses Fang Duohua's insincere smile, her cold and calculating attitude, and her hypocritical and despicable snobbery in a thorough manner. Playwrights Ouyang Yuqian, Cao Yu, and others watched this play and unanimously gave it high praise. (Attached picture)

    做功细致逼真　唱腔婉转动人
    锡剧“珍珠塔”在京打响第一炮
    本报讯　记者朱继功报道：“百花争艳”的北京艺坛上，又添喜讯。无锡市锡剧院，给观众带来了具有南方民间风味的精彩锡剧剧目。从13日起，首次公演了优秀的传统剧目“珍珠塔”，从16日起，又公演了“孟丽君”。
    “珍珠塔”是在江南一带流传很广的民间故事。它描写落魄书生方卿，千里迢迢来到襄阳投奔姑母方朵花；但这位势利的御史夫人并不念骨肉之情，反而冷讽热嘲将方卿气走。后来，方卿得中状元，御史夫人不得不履行她的誓言——侄儿若能高官做，“头顶香盘十八斤，三步一拜接方卿”。喜剧也就到此结束了。
    在这出戏中，每个演员都能各抒所长。演方卿的演员王彬彬，做派很好。在“跌雪”一场中，他运用碎步园场、滑步、坐跌等繁复的动作，把方卿从姑母家中出走途中被强盗劫去珠塔，又逢数九寒天的凄惨伤感心情刻划得很细致。这一场中以簧调、大陆调为主的大段唱腔婉转动人，韵味淳厚。在当地，王彬彬的歌唱艺术很为群众欢迎，已形成一种流派，人们称为“彬彬腔”。演员汪韵芝把势利刻薄的方朵花表演得维妙维肖。方朵花在宾客甚至丫环面前，都把娘家怎样荣华富贵，吹嘘得天花乱坠，并虚装大方。但是，当衣衫褴褛的侄儿方卿向她求助时，演员把方朵花那副皮笑肉不笑、世态炎凉、虚伪卑鄙的势利相表现得淋漓尽致。剧作家欧阳予倩、曹禺等看了这出戏以后，都一致给予好评。（附图片）
