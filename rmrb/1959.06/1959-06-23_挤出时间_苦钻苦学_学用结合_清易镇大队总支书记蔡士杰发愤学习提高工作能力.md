Squeezing Out Time, Studying Diligently, Combining Learning with Application
Cai Shijie, Secretary of the General Branch of Qingyi Town Brigade, Studies Hard to Improve Work Ability

(Reported by our newspaper) Comrade Cai Shijie, Secretary of the General Party Branch of Qingyi Town Brigade, Huiguo Town People's Commune, Gong County, Henan Province, has consistently worked well, labored well, and studied well under the leadership of the Party for several years, and consults with the masses on matters. During the Great Leap Forward last year, he excellently completed the various work tasks assigned by the Party and also worked 442 labor days, and was rated as a county labor model.

The Qingyi Town Brigade has a total of fourteen production teams, 1,396 households, and more than 7,400 people. As the secretary of the general party branch of such a large brigade, it is indeed a heavy task to complete the production tasks assigned by the superiors and the commune, and to properly arrange the work and life of more than 7,000 people. In order to effectively participate in production and lead production, Cai Shijie adopted the method of "combining work with labor" and "combining fixed labor locations and quotas with mobile labor," bringing all the work that could be done in the fields to the fields. He often said: A cadre of a production brigade is not qualified to lead the masses in production if he does not participate in production. The masses here have calculated an account for him: from May 1958 to April this year, in the twelve months, excluding work and meetings, he worked 442 labor days in 298 days (excluding subsidized work points). Among them, deep plowing of land, harvesting sweet potatoes, and planting wheat accounted for 152 labor days, cotton sowing, planting sweet potatoes, and checking seedlings and replanting accounted for 48 labor days, accumulating fertilizer, transporting manure, and applying top dressing accounted for 83 labor days, and wheat field management and pushing water wheels accounted for 68 labor days. In addition, there were 91 labor days of night shift labor.

The main reason why Cai Shijie does his work well is that he studies hard and drills diligently, being both literate and capable. In this "one day equals twenty years" era of the Great Leap Forward, Comrade Cai Shijie deeply realized that it is difficult to be competent for the glorious tasks assigned to him by the Party without strengthening his study and improving himself. Therefore, he studied diligently and worked hard. Although he only has a primary school education, he has become a "literate and capable, good at learning and using" person due to his persistence in hard study and hard drilling over the years. When you enter his residence, you can see People's Daily, Henan Daily, and other newspapers neatly arranged and hung, and theoretical books such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "On the Party" placed on his desk.

What is Cai Shijie's method of diligent study and hard drilling? That is: "Hard," "Squeeze," and "Use." "Hard" means studying hard and drilling diligently, insisting on studying for two hours early in the morning and late at night every day in addition to ensuring good work and good labor. "Squeeze" means cleverly arranging production, work, and study, and squeezing out time for study. He adhered to the method of "not walking empty roads and not idling his brain," carrying newspapers with him and studying on the spot, not even willing to let go of three to five minutes in vain. "Use" means combining theory with practice and combining learning with application. Through study, he deeply realized that ideological and political work is always the soul and commander of all work, and that in order to achieve a great leap forward in production, there must be a great leap forward in the thinking of the masses. Therefore, he paid special attention to the ideological trends of the masses during labor or at other times. Last year, when he was working in the tenth team, he found that production was not leaping forward and the enthusiasm of the masses was not high. Some commune members reflected: "Our team leader criticizes people indiscriminately, and one criticism makes everyone feel bad. Who still has the energy to work?" "Melons are melons, gourds are gourds, and black and white are distinct. There is a model for both good and bad, and it is more exciting to work!" He was further inspired after learning about the news in the newspaper about the "Five Good" commune member appraisal. Therefore, he immediately convened a general branch committee to study and decided to launch a "Five Good Commune Member" appraisal campaign in the entire brigade to commend outstanding commune members. As soon as the campaign started, a lively new situation immediately appeared in the entire brigade. On May 1 this year, they held a general meeting of all commune members, selected "Five Good Commune Members," and awarded prizes. Since then, they have evaluated "Five Good Commune Members" every time a task is completed. The masses praised: "Evaluating 'Five Good' is a clever method, you chase me and I catch up, enthusiasm is high, work hard and skillfully, and strive for 'Five Good' to make contributions."

Cai Shijie not only studies well himself, but also pays great attention to the study of the masses. When implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, he used lively methods such as "passing the drum and spreading the flowers" and "dropping the handkerchief" to conduct propaganda and education for seventy-one commune members. As a result, sixty-five commune members initially understood the nature of the people's commune, the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, and the connection and difference between the transition from socialism to communism. Li Yingli, an elderly commune member in his sixties, saw the prospects of communism more clearly after studying, and his enthusiasm became even greater. (Zhang Puzhou, Liu Shenqu)

    挤出时间  苦钻苦学  学用结合
    清易镇大队总支书记蔡士杰发愤学习提高工作能力
    本报讯　河南省巩县回郭镇人民公社清易镇大队党总支书记蔡士杰同志，几年来在党的领导下，一贯工作好，劳动好，学习好，遇事和群众商量。在去年大跃进中，他出色地完成了党交给的各项工作任务，而且还做了四百四十二个劳动日，曾被评为县劳动模范。
    清易镇大队共有十四个生产队，一千三百九十六户，七千四百多口人。作为这样一个大队的党总支书记，既要完成上级和公社交给的生产任务，又要妥善安排七千多口人的工作和生活，任务确实繁重。蔡士杰为了切实做到参加生产领导生产，采用了“工作与劳动相结合”，“固定劳动地点、定额与流动劳动相结合”的方法，把劳动中能作到的工作都带到地里。他经常说：作为一个生产大队的干部要是不参加生产，就没有资格去领导群众生产。这里群众给他算了一笔账：从1958年5月到今年4月的十二个月里，除工作、开会外，二百九十八天中共做了四百四十二个劳动日（不包括补助工分）。其中深翻土地、出红薯、种麦做一百五十二个劳动日，棉花播种、栽红薯和查苗补苗做四十八个劳动日，积肥、运粪、施追肥八十三个劳动日，麦田管理、推水车六十八个劳动日。此外，还有夜勤劳动九十一个劳动日。
    蔡士杰作好工作的主要原因是苦学苦钻，能文能武。在这“一天等于二十年”的跃进时代里，蔡士杰同志深深体会到：不加强学习，提高自己，实难胜任党所交给自己的光荣任务。因而他刻苦钻研，发愤学习。他虽然只有高小文化程度，但由于他几年来坚持苦学、苦钻，现在他已经成为一个“能文能武，善学妙用”的人了。当你走进他的住室，就可以看到整齐地排挂着人民日报、河南日报等报刊，办公桌上摆着“毛泽东选集”、“论党”等理论书籍。
    蔡士杰的勤学苦钻的方法是什么呢？那就是：“苦”、“挤”、“用”。“苦”，就是苦学苦钻，每天除保证工作好、劳动好外，都要坚持起早睡晚学习两个钟头。“挤”，就是生产、工作、学习三者巧安排，挤出时间进行学习。他坚持了“路不空走、脑不空闲”的方法，报纸随身带，学习就地来，那怕是三五分钟也不肯白白放过。“用”，就是理论与实践相结合，学与用相结合。通过学习，使他深深体会到思想工作和政治工作永远是一切工作的灵魂和统帅，要想生产大跃进，必须群众思想大跃进。因此，他在劳动中或其他时间，特别注意群众的思想动向。去年他在十队劳动时，发现生产跃不上去，群众干劲不大，有的社员反映：“俺队长批评人是不分皂白，一批评就是大家都不好，谁还有劲干呢？”“瓜是瓜，胡是胡，黑白分明，好坏都有个样儿，干着才起劲呢！”他学习了报纸上评比“五好”社员的消息后，更加得到了启发。于是，他立即召开总支委员会进行研究，决定在全大队开展“五好社员”评比运动，表扬优秀社员。运动一开始，全大队立即呈现出生动活泼的新局面。今年5月1日，他们召开全体社员大会，评选了“五好社员”，颁发了奖品。从此以后，每项工作告一段落，他们就要评一次“五好社员”。群众称赞说：“评五好，办法巧，你追我赶干劲高，大干苦干加巧干，争取‘五好’立功劳。”
    蔡士杰不但自己学习好，而且还十分注意群众的学习。在贯彻党的八届六中全会决议时，他用“击鼓传花、丢手巾”等生动活泼的方式，对七十一个社员进行了宣传教育，结果，有六十五名社员初步懂得了人民公社的性质、由社会主义的集体所有制向社会主义的全民所有制过渡及由社会主义向共产主义过渡的联系和区别。六十多岁的老社员李应礼通过学习后，更加清楚地看到了共产主义的远景，干劲也更大了。　（张普周、刘慎渠）
