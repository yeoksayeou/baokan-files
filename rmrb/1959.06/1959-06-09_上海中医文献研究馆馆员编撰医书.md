    Shanghai Chinese Medicine Literature Research Institute Librarians Compile Medical Books
    (Our report) More than forty veteran librarians at the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Literature Research Institute are actively engaged in compiling medical books and other works.
    These full-time and part-time veteran librarians, averaging seventy-five years old, have relatively rich experience in Chinese medicine. Under the care of the Party and encouraged by the policies on Chinese medicine, they are promoting the spirit of being vigorous in old age. In the past year, they have compiled and continued to write more than twenty medical books, including "History of Chinese Medicine Through the Ages," "Special Collection on Swelling," "Special Collection on Diabetes," "Collection of Treatments for Insomnia," "Newly Compiled Clinical Handbook of Tumors and Cancer," and "Medical Case Studies by Female Chinese Medicine Practitioners," as well as more than twenty academic papers.
    Ninety-seven-year-old librarian Xie Bingyao has already written multiple volumes of "Medical Collection" and "Continued Medical Collection," and has recently begun writing "Methods of Health Preservation." The six veteran librarians in the surgery research group originally planned to complete the "Essentials of Surgery" in three years, but have now finished it nineteen months ahead of schedule.
