Give play to the Bastion Role of Rural Party Branches
Pingtian Brigade Party General Branch Improves Working Methods to Continuously Promote Production

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Pingtian Brigade Party General Branch of Bairuo Commune, Changsha County, Hunan Province, in order to adapt to the situation of unified leadership and decentralized management, strengthened the Party's specific leadership over production teams. They adopted the working methods of relying on production team branches to carry out work and resolutely implementing the Party's mass line, fully giving play to the core leadership role of the Party branch, so that Party members, cadres, and commune members united as one to wholeheartedly improve production. Now, the production upsurge in this brigade is rising wave upon wave, with the number of workers attending work frequently reaching around 99%, and the commune members are full of confidence in this year's great leap forward in agricultural production.
    The Pingtian Brigade has more than 4,000 people, divided into ten production teams. After communization, Party branches were established in each production team. However, because the Party General Branch was eager to complete various tasks, it did not rely well on the branches to carry out meticulous ideological work. When tasks came, they often bypassed the Party branch and held blanket administrative meetings to pass them down. As a result, some production team branches rarely held meetings, and Party members rarely participated in organizational life. The core leadership of the branch did not form, and the Party's intentions could not be well implemented among the masses through the work of the branch and Party members. In the work of rectifying and consolidating the communes, the brigade's general branch conscientiously studied the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and adopted methods such as presenting problems, finding reasons, and recalling and comparing, to summarize and review the work of the previous stage. It was unanimously recognized that the past failure to rely on branches to carry out work was a bad tendency to neglect the Party's leadership and weaken the bastion role that rural Party branches should play in the countryside. The General Branch Committee realized that to effectively rely on the branch to carry out work, it was necessary to change the past method of blanket leadership. In the work of formulating the production leap forward plan, the General Branch Committee first convened a joint meeting of the General Branch Committee members and branch secretaries to convey the plan. Immediately afterwards, a general meeting of Party members was held with the brigade as the unit to fully promote democracy, exchange opinions, and allow Party members to express their opinions freely, putting forward many suggestions. At the same time, on the basis of raising awareness, Party members also consciously launched criticism and self-criticism. Then, meetings of cadres and the masses were held with the production team as the unit to allow the broad masses of commune members to fully express their opinions on the production plan. Because the plan formulation fully mobilized mass discussion, the plan was not only advanced and reliable, but also simultaneously mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses to complete and overfulfill the plan. In this way, the leap forward plan of the entire brigade quickly took root among the masses.
    From the remarkable effect of relying on the branch to carry out work this time, the General Branch Committee further realized the importance of strengthening the leadership of the Party's grass-roots organizations, relying on the production team branch to carry out work, and following the mass line. In order to further rely on the branch to carry out work and implement the working method of the mass line, they adopted the measures of "one determination" and "three guarantees." "One determination" is that General Branch Committee members, branches, and Party members must have fixed work locations, and "three guarantees" are that each General Branch Committee member is responsible for a production team, makes four or five close friends, does a good job in key areas, creates experience, guides the overall situation, acts as a consultant to the production team, and cultivates backbones; the production team branch is responsible for the cafeteria, requiring them to lead production, improve the lives of commune members, and also cultivate three to five backbones; Party members and activists are responsible for commune members, requiring them to make close friends with commune members, often talk heart to heart, publicize the Party's policies, and do specific ideological mobilization work. The adoption of such measures has made the leadership of the Party General Branch over the production team more meticulous and specific, and it can more timely listen to the various opinions of the masses and improve the work.
    In order to rely on the production team branch to carry out work, the General Branch also strengthened the branch strength of teams with weak foundations, and extracted three brigade-level cadres to serve as team branch secretaries. The General Branch also selected activists in places with weak foundations and adopted the method of producing during the day and studying at night to train them and add new blood to the Party's work. The Brigade General Branch also sent Party General Branch Committee members to deeply penetrate into the relatively backward production teams, mobilize the masses to present problems and find reasons, and conduct education on the ideology existing among Party members. As a result, Party members took the lead in production, the masses were also mobilized, and the backward teams were transformed into red flag teams. (Attached picture)

    发挥农村党支部的堡垒作用
    坪田大队党总支改进工作方法推动生产不断前进
    本报讯　湖南长沙县白若公社坪田大队党总支为了适应统一领导、分级管理的情况，加强党对生产队的具体领导。他们采取了依靠生产队支部进行工作，和坚决贯彻党的群众路线的工作方法，充分发挥了党支部的核心领导作用，使党员、干部和社员团结一致，全力搞好生产。现在，这个大队的生产高潮一浪高一浪，出工人数经常达到99％左右，社员们对今年农业生产的大跃进满怀着信心。
    坪田大队有四千多人，分十个生产队。公社化后各生产队都建立了党的支部，但由于党总支急于完成各种任务，没有很好地依靠支部进行细致的思想工作。任务一来，往往撇开党支部，召开一揽子行政会议往下传。这样，有些生产队的支部就很少开会，党员很少过组织生活。支部的核心领导没有形成，党的意图不能很好地通过支部和党员的工作在群众中贯彻执行。在整顿、巩固公社工作中，大队总支认真学习了党的八届六中全会的决议，采取摆问题、找原因、回忆、对比等方法，总结检查前一阶段的工作，一致认识到过去不依靠支部进行工作，是一种忽视党的领导，削弱农村党支部在农村应起的堡垒作用的不良倾向。总支委员会认识到要切实依靠支部进行工作，必须改变过去那种一揽子的领导方法。总支委员会在订生产跃进计划工作中，首先召开了总支委员和支部书记联席会议进行传达，随即以大队为单位召开党员大会，充分发扬民主，交换意见，使党员畅所欲言，提出了许多意见。同时，党员在提高觉悟的基础上，也自觉地展开了批评与自我批评。接着又以生产队为单位召开了干部和群众会议，让广大社员对生产计划充分发表意见。由于订计划中充分发动群众讨论，因此计划不仅订得先进可靠，而且同时把群众完成和超额完成计划的积极性也动员了起来。这样，全大队的跃进计划，很快就在群众中落脚生根。
    总支委员会从这次依靠支部进行工作的显著效果中，更加认识到加强对党的基层组织的领导，依靠生产队支部进行工作，和走群众路线的重要。为了进一步依靠支部进行工作，贯彻群众路线的工作方法，他们就采取了“一定”、“三包”的措施，“一定”是：总支委员、支部、党员都要有固定的工作地点，“三包”是总支委员每人包一个生产队，交四、五个知心朋友，搞好重点，创造经验，指导全面，当好生产队的参谋，培养骨干；生产队支部包食堂，要求做到领导生产，搞好社员生活，还要培养三到五个骨干；党员积极分子包社员，要求和社员交知心朋友，经常谈心，宣传党的政策，做好具体的思想发动工作。采取这样的措施，就使党总支对生产队的领导更细致、更具体，更能及时听取群众的各种不同意见，改进工作。
    为了依靠生产队支部进行工作，总支还加强对基础薄弱队的支部力量，抽出了三个大队一级的干部，分别担任队支部书记。总支还在基础薄弱的地方挑选了积极分子，采取白天生产，晚上学习的办法，训练他们，为党的工作增添新的血液。大队总支还派党总支委员深入比较落后的生产队，发动群众摆问题，找原因，针对党员中存在的思想进行教育，于是党员在生产中个个带头，群众也发动起来了，使后进队变成红旗队。（附图片）
