    Iraqi Democratic Youth Congress Opens
    Mass Parade Held in Baghdad to Celebrate the Congress

    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 11th: The first representative congress of the Iraqi Democratic Youth Federation opened here this morning. The slogan "Work, Unity, and Defend the Republic" was posted in the meeting hall.

    Six hundred representatives of Iraqi youth organizations attended the congress.

    Prime Minister Qassem, cabinet ministers, heads of people's organizations, and delegations from thirteen Asian, African, Latin American, and European countries attended the congress.

    In his speech at the congress, Prime Minister Qassem said that under the rule of the old regime, which has been eliminated, Iraqi youth were often persecuted, especially when they went abroad "to participate in congresses and meet their brothers." Qassem told the youth that they are now absolutely free to participate in any congress they wish to attend.

    Prime Minister Qassem said that Iraq has crushed the foundations of imperialism in Iraq. Imperialism will never be restored in Iraq because "we have enough power to destroy it."

    Referring to the role of the army, Prime Minister Qassem assured that the Iraqi army will fight alongside other free and peaceful forces in the world for peace and against aggression.

    Nuri Abdul Razzaq Hussein, Secretary of the Preparatory Committee of the Iraqi Democratic Youth Federation, in his speech, reviewed the historical context of the Federation's secret establishment in 1951 and said, "The Federation played an effective role in uniting the youth and opposing the overthrown regime." He contrasted the past with the present, saying that the revolution has made it possible for us to carry out activities legally; this congress is the result of the revolution.

    Razzaq Hussein emphasized, "As long as political forces are united in the national front, the revolution will continue to develop."

    Wu Xueqian, the Chinese youth representative, conveyed the congratulations of the Chinese youth and people to the congress. He said that the Iraqi people are not isolated in their just struggle to defend the achievements of the revolution and defend the republic; they are supported by the youth and people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world.

    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 12th: Iraqi youth held a grand parade in Baghdad today to celebrate the opening of the Iraqi Democratic Youth Congress. Tens of thousands of people from all walks of life in Baghdad participated in the parade.

    The parade began at 6 p.m. Members of the Preparatory Committee of the Iraqi Democratic Youth Federation walked in the front, along with Bernini, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Behind them were foreign representatives from twenty countries.

    Mahdawi, President of the Iraqi Supreme Special Military Court, and Colonel Taher, aide-de-camp to Prime Minister Qassem, also participated in the parade.

    Participants in the parade included trade unions, farmers' associations, student contingents, representatives of various ethnic minorities, women from all walks of life, and many soldiers.

    As the procession passed, residents standing on both sides of the street, on balconies, and on rooftops gave warm applause.

    According to Baghdad Radio, similar celebrations were also held in many parts of Iraq.

    The Iraqi Democratic Youth Congress opened in Baghdad on the 11th.

    新华社巴格达11日电　伊拉克民主青年联合会第一次代表大会今天上午在这里开幕。会场中张贴着这样的标语：“工作、团结和保卫共和国”。
    伊拉克青年组织的六百名代表出席了大会。
    卡塞姆总理，内阁部长们，人民团体的负责人，十三个亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和欧洲国家的代表团出席了这次大会。
    卡塞姆总理在代表大会上发表讲话说，在已被消灭的旧政权的统治下，伊拉克青年常常遭到迫害，特别是当他们去国外“参加代表大会和会见他们的兄弟的时候”。卡塞姆对青年们说，他们现在可以绝对自由地去参加他们所希望参加的代表大会。
    卡塞姆总理说，伊拉克已经粉碎帝国主义在伊拉克的基础。帝国主义永远不会在伊拉克复辟了，因为“我们有足够的力量来摧毁它。”
    在谈到军队的作用时，卡塞姆总理保证伊拉克军队将同世界上其他自由和和平的力量一道为争取和平和反对侵略而斗争。
    伊拉克民主青年联合会筹备委员会书记努里·阿卜杜勒·拉扎克·侯赛因在讲话中回顾了联合会在1951年秘密建立的历史背景，并且说，“联合会在团结青年队伍和反对被推翻的政权方面起过有效的作用”。他把过去和现在作了对比，他说，革命使我们有可能合法地进行活动；这次代表大会就是革命的成果。
    拉扎克·侯赛因着重说，“只要政治力量团结在全国阵线当中，革命就将继续发展。”
    中国青年代表吴学谦向大会转达了中国青年和人民的祝贺。他说，伊拉克人民在保卫革命成果、保卫共和国的正义斗争中不是孤立的；他们得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营青年和人民以及全世界所有爱好和平的人民的支持。
