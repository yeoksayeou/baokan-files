To conscientiously do a good job in rural summer work
Instructions issued by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee
    (Our dispatch) The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on May 30th regarding conscientiously doing a good job in rural summer work to achieve good harvests, good retention, good procurement, good utilization, and good planting.
    The instructions first pointed out that obtaining the fruits of the first bumper harvest after communization, and planting promptly, planting more, and planting well, are of vital importance for further encouraging the masses to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest throughout the year, running the people's communes well, supporting national industrial construction, and arranging for the people's livelihood. During this tense season, all localities must conscientiously focus on wheat harvesting, summer planting, summer distribution, and summer grain procurement, achieving good harvests, good retention, good procurement, good utilization, and good planting, to further mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses and quickly set off a new upsurge of summer production on an even larger scale, to ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production.
              A Half-Month Blitz to Ensure Every Grain is Secured
    The instructions put forward specific requirements for timely harvesting. The slogan is: "A half-month blitz, clean fields and threshing grounds, three quicks (quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick storage), three goods (good harvesting, good threshing, good storage), every grain into the granary." The instructions require all localities to: (1) conscientiously grasp the appropriate time for wheat ripening, specifically arrange the harvesting sequence, harvest as soon as ripe, harvest one section as soon as it's ripe, harvest quickly and meticulously to ensure quality; (2) harvest and transport simultaneously, finishing the same day, and not let the wheat stay in the fields overnight; (3) production teams should organize auxiliary labor to glean wheat, dividing into sections with contracted responsibility, gleaning immediately after cutting, ensuring no lost plants in the fields and no lost ears on the roads, gleanings belong to the team, fixed quotas are recorded, and labor is paid according to work points; (4) threshing should be done on the spot, simultaneously with harvesting, spread thinly, sun evenly, turn frequently, roll more, winnow cleanly, and sweep cleanly, ensuring no grains remain on the ears and no grains are lost on the threshing ground; (5) thresh one ground, weigh one ground, verify the yield, do not conceal the yield, do not make false reports; (6) dry and store well, every grain into the granary; (7) determine seed retention areas, select good seeds, and harvest, thresh, and store them separately for self-use; (8) establish wheat protection organizations, mobilize the masses to democratically agree on wheat protection covenants, protect against wind, rain, and fire, and avoid accidental losses.
    This year's wheat has been planted and managed according to the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter," and there will be many examples of large-scale high-yield and high-volume production. In order to make these experiences play an active role in future wheat production and autumn field management, the instructions require all localities to use the method of combining leading cadres, technical cadres, and working farmers, and combining the old, middle-aged, and young, to go deep into the front lines and summarize the wheat high-yield experience centered on rational close planting under different regions, different soils, fertility, and different cultivation levels. During the summer harvest, all levels should send out a large number of cadres, led by responsible cadres, to go deep into the countryside and participate in the harvest with the masses in the posture of ordinary laborers, verify the yield, and summarize the experience.
      Properly Handle the Relationship between the State, Communes, and Commune Members,
          Conscientiously Implement the Principle of Distribution According to Labor
    The instructions require all communes and production teams to, on the basis of abundant production, bumper harvests, and verified yields, retain seeds, rations, and feed according to the spirit of state procurement, appropriate retention, and overall arrangement of the people's livelihood; and distribute well according to the principle of distribution according to labor and more pay for more work. This year's summer harvest distribution is the first after communization, and doing a good job in this summer harvest distribution will have a huge effect on promoting a high tide of summer and autumn production. The sign of doing a good job in summer harvest distribution is to properly handle the relationship between the state, communes, production teams, and commune members, and implement the principle of distribution according to labor and more pay for more work. (1) According to the principle of less deduction and more distribution, different distribution ratios should be determined according to local conditions based on the different situations of wheat harvesting and diverse economic income. (2) In the summer harvest distribution, the distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system should be implemented according to the principle of distribution according to labor and more pay for more work. All localities can adopt different forms of supply according to the amount of supply. Which form to adopt should be analyzed based on specific conditions and determined in consultation with the masses. For accounting units implementing contracted work and output, the distribution can be roughly based on half of the total contracted work amount of the team for the whole year; in places where output determines work, the production team can distribute according to the amount of work converted from the output of each team, but the production team should generally distribute the wage portion of the commune members according to the actual labor days of the commune members. (3) The summer harvest distribution should conscientiously implement the policy of rewarding labor. Where units implementing contracted work and output are basically reasonable, they should be implemented according to the original regulations. Units that have not implemented contracted work and output or have not implemented contracted work and output should also conduct democratic evaluation and reward those with good production to further encourage the production enthusiasm of production teams and commune members. (4) Combine summer harvest distribution with improving cafeteria work. All localities should actively rectify cafeterias based on the principles of actively running them well, voluntary participation by the masses, diversity, and being conducive to production. Run various types of cafeterias according to different seasons, different conditions, and different requirements of the masses. The cafeterias should continue to implement the method of rationing per person, using meals with tickets, and returning savings to individuals.
            Quickly Complete the Summer Procurement Task
    The instructions require that while doing a good job in harvesting and threshing, retaining rations, seeds, and feed, and doing a good job in summer distribution, the summer procurement task should be completed quickly, and the procurement and transfer work should not be postponed until the summer crops are completely harvested.
    This year's requisition task is the same as last year, without any increase; the procurement task is larger than last year. With the development of socialist construction, the country's need for grain should also increase accordingly. It should be made clear to the masses that buying more grain this year is to support industry, to support deficit areas in surplus areas, urban and rural mutual support, and jointly build socialism. At the same time, it should be made clear to the masses and grass-roots cadres that grain and other products are all subject to the policy of equivalent exchange, and resolutely prohibit uncompensated adjustments; the sale of grain and other products must be implemented in accordance with the provisions of buying goods and paying, who sells who gets the money, and the money and goods are clear, and no direct deduction is allowed; more grain sold in the summer, the autumn procurement does not increase. In short, we should make clear to the broad masses of members and grass-roots cadres the truth that "the river is full, the small canals are full", and explain the reasons for the slight increase in the unified procurement task, explain the importance of ensuring the completion of the procurement task to support socialist construction, explain the party and government's various policy provisions on grain procurement, mobilize the broad masses, promote the spirit of patriotism, and enthusiastically turn in public grain and sell surplus grain. The agricultural tax paid by all communes and production teams and the grain sold to the state should be dried and cleaned to ensure quality, and at the same time, it should be sold quickly and transported quickly. Grain purchasing departments at all levels must promptly prepare for inspecting grain quality, weighing and warehousing, etc., to achieve immediate receipt, immediate inspection, immediate weighing, and immediate warehousing, and immediately settle accounts and pay, grain and money are clear, the procedures are simple, and the masses are satisfied. The procurement work is an urgent task; the faster it is completed, the more power and time it can free up to lead agricultural production and do other work well. Leading organs at all levels should comprehensively arrange procurement work and other work, and should list procurement work as a central task for a certain period of time, vigorously attack, and do it in one go.
                Pay Attention to Saving Grain
    The instructions also require that after abundant production and bumper harvests, we should carry forward the glorious tradition of living a diligent and thrifty life, saving money and saving food, and saving grain. Whether in rural or urban areas, whether it is a people's commune or an organ, troops, schools, enterprises and other grain-consuming units, we must pay close attention to careful calculation, cherish grain, and widely mobilize the masses to fight against all phenomena of grain waste. Rural people's communes should run public canteens well based on production needs and the principle of voluntary participation by the masses. For commune member households that eat at home, they should also be persuaded to arrange their grain consumption well. Cities should earnestly verify the population, adhere to the system, prevent floating expenditures and fraudulent claims, and overcome waste. In terms of grain consumption, we should look ahead and behind, summer thinking about autumn, this year thinking about next year, good harvest thinking about poor harvest, save food, long-term flow, eat more when busy, eat less when idle, eat dry when busy, and half dry and half porridge when idle. And it is necessary to quantify the amount per person, plan consumption, not only to eat enough, but also to save all the grain that can be saved. The state, communes, canteens, and all grain-using households must keep the grain well.
                Try to Expand the Summer Planting Area
    The instructions pointed out that the key to achieving this year's grain production increase plan lies in trying every possible means to increase total grain production. Therefore, after the summer harvest, we must try our best to expand the summer planting area and strive to plant another season of crops on all land that can be replanted. Summer planting crops should continue to be planted in accordance with the national plan, and we should advocate planting more high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, and millet according to local conditions; areas that have not completed the spring planting plan for oil crops should try their best to plant more sesame, stubble peanuts and other small oil materials. The feed land that should be distributed to commune members to raise pigs should be quickly demarcated in accordance with national regulations and planted in a timely manner. Use all idle land to plant more melons and vegetables, whoever plants it gets it. In one-water-one-wheat areas that are not suitable for replanting, green manure crops should be planted and plowed in time to prepare for planting wheat in the fall. In summer, we must compete with the sky for time, harvest one piece and plant one piece.
    The fundamental issue in doing a good job in summer harvest and summer planting is to concentrate all available labor and put it into the front line. The instructions require that areas with summer harvest and summer planting tasks should, at a minimum, ensure that more than 80% of the rural labor force is mobilized to participate in agricultural production. Mobilize surplus labor in cities to return to rural production; compress the labor used more by county and commune industries; streamline commune service personnel and livestock breeding personnel. At the critical juncture of summer harvest and summer planting, agencies, troops, schools, county and commune industrial enterprises in various localities should draw out as much manpower, animal power, and tools as possible to support the communes and production teams in carrying out blitzes. In areas with particularly large summer harvest and summer planting tasks, we should continue to carry forward the spirit of unity, fraternity, and mutual assistance, and voluntarily organize cooperation through consultation based on the principle of equivalent exchange.
    The instructions finally put forward that in order to do a good job in summer harvest, summer planting, summer distribution, and summer procurement, we must put politics in command, ideology first, and give play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses. Party committees at all levels should attach great importance to political and ideological work, deeply publicize the party and government's policies on rewarding production, distribution according to labor, and summer procurement, and educate the broad masses to love the country and love the commune; at the same time, educate cadres to rely on the masses, consult with the masses on matters, and follow the mass line.
    Summer is a busy season for agricultural affairs, and all localities must strengthen leadership, emphasize unified leadership, make comprehensive arrangements, focus on the center, grasp every link, closely combine summer harvest and summer planting, summer distribution, and summer procurement, and do everything well. Leading party and government organs at all levels should mobilize and organize forces from all aspects, led by key cadres, to go to communes, production teams, and the masses to publicize the party's policies, actively participate in labor, promptly discover problems, solve problems, and ensure good harvests, good retention, good procurement, good utilization, and good planting, so that all commune members are in a more cheerful mood and set off a new upsurge in production in summer and autumn.

    切实做好夏季农村工作
    中共河北省委、省人民委员会发出指示
    本报讯　中共河北省委、河北省人民委员会在5月30日发出关于切实做好夏季农村工作，实现收好、留好、征购好、用好、种好的指示。
    指示首先指出，把公社化后的第一次丰收果实拿到手，并且适时播种，多种、种好，对于进一步鼓舞群众争取全年农业大丰收和办好人民公社，支援国家工业建设和安排人民生活，有十分重要的意义。在这个紧张的季节里，各地必须切实抓好麦收、夏种、夏季分配和夏粮征购工作，做到收好、留好、征购好、用好、种好，进一步调动广大群众的积极性，迅速掀起一个规模更大的夏季生产新高潮，以保证农业生产的继续跃进。
              半月突击　颗粒归仓
    指示对于适时抢收提出了具体的要求。口号是：“半月突击，地净场光，三快（收的快、打的快、入仓快），三好（收的好、打的好、保管的好），颗粒入仓”。要求各地：（1）切实掌握小麦成熟适期，具体安排收割顺序，腊熟即收，熟一块，收一块，快收细收，保证质量；（2）随收、随运，当天收好，当天运完，不使小麦在田间过夜；（3）生产小队组织辅助劳力拾麦，分片包干，前割后拾，使地无丢棵，路无丢穗，拾麦归队，定额记工，按工付酬；（4）就地踩场，边收边打，要薄摊、匀晒、勤翻、多轧、扬净、扫净，做到穗不带粒，场不丢粒；（5）碾一场，秤一场，核实产量，不瞒产，不虚报；（6）晒干藏好，粒粒入仓；（7）确定留种地，挑选优良种子，并单收、单打、单存，实现自留自用；（8）建立护麦组织，发动群众民主议定护麦公约，防风，防雨，防火，避免意外损失。
    今年小麦是按照“八字宪法”的要求种植和管理的，将会出现很多大面积丰产和高额丰产典型。为了使这些经验在今后小麦生产和秋田管理中发挥积极的作用，指示中要求各地采用领导干部、技术干部、劳动农民三结合和老年、壮年、青年三结合的方法，深入现场，总结在不同地区、不同土壤、肥力和不同耕作水平等条件下，以合理密植为中心的小麦丰产经验。夏收期间，各级都应派出大批干部，由负责干部率领，深入农村，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和群众一道参加收获，核实产量，总结经验。
      妥善处理国家、公社和社员之间关系，
          认真贯彻按劳分配原则
    指示要求各个公社、生产队，在丰产丰收、核实产量的基础上，本着国家征购、适当扣留和群众生活统筹安排的精神，把种子、口粮、饲料留好；根据按劳分配、多劳多得的原则分配好。今年夏收分配是公社化以后的第一次，搞好这次夏收分配，对促进夏秋生产高潮有巨大作用。搞好夏收分配的标志，就是妥善处理国家、公社、生产队和社员之间的关系，贯彻执行按劳分配、多劳多得的原则。（1）应根据少扣多分的原则，按照麦收和多种经济收入的不同情况，因地制宜地确定不同的分配比例。（2）夏收分配中，应当根据按劳分配、多劳多得的原则，贯彻执行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度。各地可根据供给部分的多少，采取不同的供给形式。究竟采取那种形式，要分析具体条件，和群众商量确定。实行包工包产的核算单位，可大体以小队全年包工总额的半数进行分配；实行以产定工的地方，生产队可根据各小队产量折工数量的多少进行分配，但是生产小队对社员工资部分，一般应按社员实作劳动日分配。（3）夏收分配要认真执行奖励劳动的政策。凡是实行包工包产的单位，只要基本合理，就按原来规定执行。包工包产没有落实的或者没有实行包工包产的单位，也要通过民主评议，对生产好的进行奖励，进一步鼓舞生产小队和社员的生产积极性。（4）结合夏收分配，改进食堂工作。各地应本着积极办好、群众自愿、多种多样、有利生产的原则，积极进行整顿。根据不同季节、不同条件，群众的不同要求，办各种各样的食堂。食堂要继续实行以人定量、凭票用饭、节约归个人的办法。
            迅速完成夏季征购任务
    指示要求在收好打好，留好口粮、种子、饲料，做好夏季分配工作的同时，迅速完成夏季征购任务，不要把征购工作和调运工作推延到夏季作物完全收获以后再去进行。
    今年的征收任务同去年一样，没有增加；收购任务比去年大。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，国家对粮食的需要也应当有相应的增长。应当向群众讲清楚，今年多购一些粮食，是为了支援工业，丰收地区支援歉收地区，城乡互相支援，共同建设社会主义。同时应当向群众和基层干部讲清楚，粮食和其他产品一律实行等价交换的政策，坚决禁止无代价的调剂；出售粮食和其他产品，都必须执行买货付款、谁卖谁得，钱货两清，不准直接扣款的规定；夏季多交售了粮食，秋季收购不增加。总之，应该向广大社员和基层干部讲清“大河水满小渠足”的道理，讲清统购任务略有增加的原因，讲清保证完成征购任务对支援社会主义建设的重要意义，讲清党和政府关于征购粮食的各项政策规定，动员广大群众，发扬爱国主义精神，踊跃交公粮、售余粮。各公社、生产队缴纳的农业税和卖给国家的粮食，都应该晒干扬净，保证质量，同时要做到卖的快，运的快。各级粮食收购部门，必须及时做好检验粮质、过秤入仓等准备工作，做到随收、随验、随过秤、随入仓，并立即结账付款，粮款两清，手续简便，群众满意。征购工作是一项紧急任务；越完成的快，越能够腾出力量和时间领导农业生产，做好其他工作。各级领导机关应该全面安排征购工作和其他工作，并要把征购工作列为一定时间的中心任务，大力突击，一气呵成。
                注意节约粮食
    指示还要求在丰产丰收之后，发扬勤俭过日子，省吃俭用，节约粮食的光荣传统。无论农村和城市，无论人民公社和机关、部队、学校、企业等一切消费粮食的单位，都必须十分注意精打细算，爱惜粮食，并广泛地发动群众向一切浪费粮食的现象进行斗争。农村人民公社要根据生产需要、群众自愿的原则，办好公共食堂。对在家吃饭的社员户，也要劝说他们把粮食吃用安排好。城市应该认真核实人口，坚持制度，防止浮支冒领，克服浪费现象。在粮食吃用上，应该瞻前顾后，夏季想到秋季，今年想到明年，丰收想到歉收，节约吃用，细水长流，忙时多吃，闲时少吃，忙时吃干，闲时半干半稀。并且要按人定量，计划消费，既要吃饱，又要把一切可以节省的粮食省下来。国家、公社、食堂和一切用粮户，都要把粮食保管好。
                尽力扩大夏播面积
    指示指出，实现今年粮食增产计划的关键，在于千方百计地提高粮食总产量。因此，夏收之后，要尽力扩大夏播面积，力争把一切能够复种的土地再种一季作物。夏播作物应该继续按照国家计划进行种植，要因地制宜地提倡多种一些甘薯、玉米、谷子等高产作物；没有完成春播油料作物种植计划的地区，尽力多种一些芝麻、麦茬花生和其他小油料。社员户养猪应该分得的饲料地，要按照国家规定迅速划好，及时种好。利用一切闲散地，尽量多种一些瓜菜，谁种谁得。一水一麦地区不宜复种的留麦地，要种植绿肥作物，并适时耕翻，准备秋季种麦。夏季必须与天争时，收一块，种一块。
    作好夏收夏种的根本问题，是集中一切可以动员的劳动力，投入第一线。指示要求凡有夏收夏种任务的地区，最低限度要保证动员农村80％以上的劳动力参加农业生产。动员城市多余的劳动力回农村生产；压缩县、社工业多用的劳力；精简公社的服务人员和畜牧饲养人员。在夏收夏种紧急关头，各地的机关、部队、学校，县、社工业企业，要抽出可能抽出的人力、畜力、工具等，支援公社和生产队进行突击。夏收夏种任务特别大的地区，应该继续发扬团结友爱互相帮助的精神，本着等价交换的原则，通过协商，自愿组织协作。
    指示最后提出，为了做好夏收夏种、夏季分配、夏季征购工作，必须政治挂帅，思想先行，发挥广大群众的积极性。各级党委应十分重视政治思想工作，深入宣传党和政府有关奖励生产、按劳分配、夏季征购的政策，教育广大群众爱国、爱社；同时，教育干部依靠群众，有事同群众商量，走好群众路线。
    夏季是农事繁忙的季节，各地必须加强领导，强调统一领导，全面安排，围绕中心，环环抓紧，使夏收夏种、夏季分配、夏季征购等工作密切结合，样样作好。各级党政领导机关应该动员和组织各方面的力量，由主要干部带领，到公社、生产队和群众中去，宣传党的政策，积极参加劳动，及时发现问题，解决问题，保证收好、留好、征购好、用好、种好，使全体社员心情更加舒畅，掀起夏秋两季的生产新高潮。
