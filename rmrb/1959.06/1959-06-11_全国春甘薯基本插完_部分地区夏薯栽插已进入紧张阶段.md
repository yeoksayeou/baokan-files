Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Spring sweet potato planting has been basically completed across the country. Immediately following the wheat harvest, a high tide of summer sweet potato planting is about to appear. In provinces with earlier seasons, such as Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Sichuan, summer sweet potato seedling planting work has entered a tense stage. By the end of May, Hunan Province had planted approximately two million mu of summer sweet potatoes.

Since the start of spring sowing, the planned planting area for sweet potatoes in various regions has continued to increase. Yongxing County in Hunan Province originally planned to plant 35,000 mu of sweet potatoes, but after three revisions to the plan, it was decided to increase it to 50,000 mu. After discussing the benefits of various tuber crops, the Chengguan People's Commune in Yanshan County, Hebei Province, increased its planned planting area from 8,000 mu to 10,400 mu. Various regions are doing everything possible to tap the potential of the land and increase sweet potato planting. Many counties in Fujian Province are utilizing fallow mountain fields, gaps in tea gardens, small pieces of cultivated wasteland, and open spaces in front of and behind houses to plant sweet potatoes. Yichun Special District in Jiangxi Province mobilized the masses to expand sweet potato planting by more than 133,000 mu using fallow fields and reclaimed wasteland, and planted sweet potatoes in holes in the gaps between tea trees on more than 100,000 mu. Many farmers in Hunan, Jiangsu, and other provinces have also planted sweet potatoes on the fodder land allocated by the commune.

Based on last year's high-yield experience, various regions generally advanced sweet potato seedling cultivation and planting this year. Sweet potato seedling cultivation in Zhejiang Province was completed approximately fifteen days earlier than in previous years, basically ending at the end of March, and the planting time was also advanced accordingly. The planting time in Fujian, Jiangsu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other places was also advanced by ten days to half a month compared to previous years. At the same time, various regions paid attention to planting quality. The sweet potatoes that have already been planted in Fujian Province generally meet the intensive planting requirements that were discussed and decided upon with the commune members based on local conditions. The planting density in most sweet potato fields in Henan Province is between 2,000 and 2,500 plants per mu, with 5,000 to 6,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu. Wenzhou Special District, the main sweet potato producing area in Zhejiang Province, focused on turning over the soil and improving the soil in sweet potato fields before planting seedlings. In Ruian County, 60% of the sweet potato land had 200 dan of foreign soil added per mu at the same time as being turned over. Some counties in Hunan launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign to prepare sufficient fertilizer for wheat stubble sweet potatoes. Each mu of sweet potato land in Yongxing County has more than 500 dan of fertilizer, of which high-quality compost accounts for about 30%.

In order to ensure that there is no shortage of sweet potato seedlings while expanding the planting area, various regions have strengthened leadership over seedling cultivation. In Henan Province, the total number of summer sweet potato seedlings cultivated in the province is generally sufficient. In addition to continuing to strengthen seedling bed management to strive for more robust seedlings, the province is also organizing adjustments between regions based on surpluses and deficits. Due to the expansion of the area, Shandong Province is short of sweet potato seedlings for approximately 1.5 million mu of land throughout the province. The Provincial Party Committee has notified various regions to strengthen the cultivation of existing seedlings, conduct a thorough assessment of seedling surpluses and deficits, and make mutual adjustments. It has also sent cadres to Henan, Hebei, and other provinces to purchase some sweet potato seedlings. (Attached picture)

### 全国春甘薯基本插完  部分地区夏薯栽插已进入紧张阶段

    全国春甘薯基本插完
    部分地区夏薯栽插已进入紧张阶段
    据新华社10日讯　全国各地春甘薯已经基本插完。紧接着麦收完毕，即将出现一个夏甘薯的插植高潮。季节较早的湖南、江西、浙江、福建、四川等省，夏甘薯插苗工作已经进入紧张阶段。湖南省到5月底已插夏甘薯二百万亩左右。
    春播开始以来，各地计划种植甘薯的面积不断增加。湖南省永兴县原计划种植甘薯三万五千亩，经过三次修改计划，决定增加到五万亩。河北省盐山县城关人民公社讨论了多种薯类作物的好处后，计划种植面积由八千亩增加到一万零四百亩。各地都千方百计地挖掘土地潜力，增种甘薯。福建省不少县份利用休闲山田、茶园隙地、小片熟荒地和房前屋后空地种植甘薯。江西省宜春专区发动群众利用休闲田、撩荒地扩种甘薯十三万三千多亩，利用茶树空隙地打洞种甘薯十万多亩。湖南、江苏等省不少农民还在公社拨给的饲料地上种了甘薯。
    根据去年丰产经验，今年各地普遍提早甘薯育苗和插植。浙江省的甘薯育苗，比往年提早十五天左右，在3月底就基本结束，插植时间也相应提前。福建、江苏、广西、贵州、四川等地的插植时间也比往年提前十天到半月。同时，各地都注意了插植质量。福建省已经插下的甘薯，一般都合乎根据当地具体条件与社员商讨决定的密植要求。河南省大部分甘薯田的的插苗密度都在二千到二千五百株之间，每亩施基肥五千到六千斤。浙江省主要甘薯产区温州专区，在甘薯插苗以前就大抓薯田翻地和土壤改良工作。瑞安县有60％的甘薯地，在翻好的同时，每亩还加了客土二百担。湖南有些县开展了积肥运动，为麦茬薯准备充足的肥料。永兴县每亩甘薯地有肥料五百多担，其中质量较好的堆肥占30％左右。
    为了保证在扩大种植面积的情况下不缺薯苗，各地都对育苗加强了领导。河南省已育的夏薯苗，全省总算账，一般不缺，目前除继续加强苗床管理争取多采壮苗以外，同时还根据余缺，组织地区之间进行调剂。山东省由于扩大面积，全省约缺一百五十万亩地的薯苗，省委已通知各地，加强培育现有薯苗；同时进行苗子盈缺摸底，互相调剂。并派出干部到河南、河北等省采购部分薯苗。（附图片）
