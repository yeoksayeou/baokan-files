    Glorious Posts, Admirable People
    By Our Correspondent Wang Boqing
    On the battlefield, on construction sites, in all the great and vigorous endeavors, many comrades are creating brilliant achievements for the Party and the people, displaying the true qualities of revolutionary heroism. At the same time, in the revolutionary ranks, there are also countless comrades who hold fast to their "ordinary" work posts, with unwavering loyalty, diligently and conscientiously, burying themselves in hard work, also displaying the heroic qualities of revolutionaries.
    Archive work is a "profession" not well known to the general public, but the archival workers of New China deeply understand that this work is an indispensable part of the revolutionary cause. When the Chinese revolution was still a "spark," the Party Central Committee stipulated the "Measures for Handling Documents" in 1931. The last sentence of this measure stated that the documents should be sorted and stored in the library, ready for the Party History Committee after the victory of the revolution. For archival workers who are serving the socialist cause, nothing is more exciting than the Party's far-sighted instructions, from which they draw endless nourishment and love their profession a hundredfold.
    Liang Tiancai, a young Communist Party member and archivist of the Xichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province, is the most familiar to everyone. Under the leadership of the county committee, he figured out a set of rules, which is: put the position of archival work after the central work, provide archival materials to strive to run before the central work, and let archival materials be used in the central work. Once, Liang Tiancai and the director of the office were attending a meeting in Nanyang. At that time, the flood season was approaching, and they thought that during the flood season last year, many places had landslides, destroying houses, injuring people, and causing great losses, so they couldn't help feeling anxious. In order to compile a circular and draw everyone's attention, Liang Tiancai asked the county committee correspondent to take a day and a half bus ride to send the materials in the archives that recorded unstable mountain conditions from Xichuan to Nanyang. Liang Tiancai stayed up all night to sort it out and provide it to the flood control office for reference. Based on these materials, the flood control office mobilized fourteen households to move away from dangerous places.
    "We are assistants, and we are happy to be assistants, because we are assisting the cause of the Party!" This is the common voice from the bottom of the hearts of activists in archival work. Take Zhou Yingrui! She only came to the Anshan Municipal Party Committee as an archivist in January last year. She dared to break superstitions, boldly create, and did a good job. Living in Anshan, the scenes of Anshan gave her great strength. She saw that the comrades in the commercial department "delivered goods to the door," so she imitated this method and stipulated that she should be quick on her feet, quick with her mouth, and inquire more about the needs of comrades, "deliver goods to the door." She thought of everyone and helped everyone. The comrades were very touched, praised her advanced service method, and praised her for making a "revolution" in improving her work style.
    Planning for others everywhere and taking helping others as one's greatest happiness is the characteristic of Luo Guanghou, a twenty-one-year-old Communist Party member and archivist of the Guangdong Provincial Forestry Department. Every year, the Forestry Department has many cadres going to the countryside, and some of them often can't grasp the changes in the agency after returning after a few months, and the work is not going smoothly. Luo Guanghou felt very uneasy after seeing this situation. He thought that reflecting the changes in the work of the agency was his undeniable responsibility. Although the matter was small, if the Communist Party members didn't take care of it, who would take care of it? So he compiled a "Chronicle of Major Events in the Agency," which provided convenience for the work of leaders and comrades.
    Comrade Ye Huang, secretary and archivist of the Qianxian People's Commune in Xiamen City, since the severe punishment of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Jinmen last year, together with other comrades in the commune, has successively collected, sorted out, and compiled materials on twenty-one advanced collectives and more than seven hundred heroic and exemplary figures. He and another commune cadre once risked the danger of artillery fire to compile a circular on the "Twenty-Three Warriors" in the forward fortifications. Soon, a wave of learning from the "Twenty-Three Warriors" was set off in the suburbs of Xiamen. Therefore, when people praise the heroes who fought against the enemy, they often mention Ye Huang in connection.
    Archival workers have dedicated their labor and wisdom in ordinary posts, and people have also awarded them honors with passion. Please see this message on the file book of the Zhejiang Public Security Department: "This is not a store, and there are no service personnel, but coming here is more pleasant and energetic than going to a place to play. There is Comrade Xia, who is more enthusiastic than the store service personnel. He is truly a servant of the people, which is worthy of my learning."

    光荣的岗位，可敬的人
    本报记者　汪波清
    在战场上，在建设工地上，在一切轰轰烈烈的事业中，许许多多同志为党为人民创造着光辉的事迹，显示出了革命英雄主义的本色。同时，在革命队伍中，也有无数的同志坚守在“平凡”的工作岗位上，一片忠心，勤勤恳恳，埋头苦干，也显示了革命者的英雄本色。
    档案资料工作是一般人不很熟悉的一个“行业”，但是新中国的档案工作者深刻懂得，这一工作是革命事业不可缺少的一部分。当中国革命还是“星星之火”的时候，党中央就在1931年规定了“文书处置办法”。这个办法的最后一句说，要把文书整理一份入库，备交革命胜利后的党史委员会。对于正在为社会主义事业服务的档案资料工作者说来，再没有什么比党的这种高瞻远瞩的指示更使他们激动的了，他们在其中汲取无限的滋养，百倍热爱自己的职业。
    河南省中共淅川县委会档案员、年轻的共产党员梁天才，就是大家最熟悉的一个。他在县委会的领导下摸出一套规律，这就是：把档案工作的位置放在中心工作之后，提供档案资料争取跑在中心工作之前，让档案资料用在中心工作之中。有一次，梁天才和办公室主任在南阳开会，那时汛期快要到了，他们想在去年汛期的时候，不少地方山坡塌陷，毁房伤人，损失很大，因此他们心里火辣辣地按耐不住。梁天才为了编写通报，引起大家注意，他就让县委通讯员坐一天半的班车，把档案中那些记录山势不稳的材料，由淅川送到南阳。梁天才就不眠不休地把它整理出来，提供给防汛办公室参考。防汛办公室根据这些材料，动员十四户居民搬家，离开了危险的地方。
    “我们是助手，我们乐意干助手，因为我们助的是党的事业！”这是档案资料工作积极分子们发自内心的共同声音。就说周英瑞吧！她是去年1月间才到鞍山市委当档案员的。她敢于破除迷信，大胆创造，做好了工作。生活在鞍山，鞍山的一切景象给了她很大的力量。她看到商业部门的同志“送货上门”，她就仿效这种方法，规定自己要腿勤、嘴快，多打听同志们的需要，“送货上门”。她为大家着想，帮助了大家。同志们很是感动，赞扬她的先进的服务方式，夸奖她在改进工作作风上闹了“革命”。
    处处为别人打算，把帮助别人当做自己的最大快乐，这是广东省林业厅档案员、二十一岁的共产党员罗光后的特点。林业厅每年有许多干部下乡，有的一去几个月回来后往往摸不着机关里的变化，工作挺不顺手。罗光后看到这种情况后，心里很不安，他想，把机关工作的变化反映出来是自己不容分说的责任，事情虽小，共产党员不管，可让谁来管呢？于是他就编了一种“机关大事记”，为领导和同志们的工作提供了方便。
    厦门市前线人民公社秘书兼档案员叶煌同志，从去年严惩金门蒋军以来，和公社的其它同志们一起，先后收集、整理、编写了二十一个先进集体和七百多个英雄模范人物的材料。他和另外一位社干部曾经冒着炮火的危险，在前沿工事里编写了“二十三勇士”的通报。不久，厦门市郊区很快便掀起了学习“二十三勇士”的热潮。因此，当人们在赞颂对敌人斗争的英雄们的时候，也常常联系着提到叶煌。
    档案工作者在平凡的岗位上，献出了他们的劳动和智慧，人们也满怀激情地把荣誉奖给他们。请看浙江公安厅档案簿上的这段留言：“这里不是商店，也没有服务员，可是到这里比到游玩的地方精神更愉快，工作更起劲。这里有着比商店服务员更热情的夏同志，他真是人民的服务员，这是值得我学习的榜样。”
