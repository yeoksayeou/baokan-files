Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th – Guangwu Commune in Jieshou County, Anhui Province, achieved a large-scale bumper harvest by tapping labor potential and improving agricultural techniques. After verification, the team's 6,188 mu of wheat averaged 472.2 jin per mu, more than double the yield of last year. Among them, 13 mu of high-yield fields averaged 1,030 jin per mu.

Wang Lao Jia Brigade has historically had few people and a lot of land, with each male and female laborer responsible for 13 mu of cultivated land. In addition, the brigade has more than 3,700 mu of silted land, and the moisture retention time after rain is short, so it has not been possible to sow in time in previous years. After communization last year, more than 800 women were freed from household labor and participated in field production, solving the problem of labor shortage to some extent, ensuring timely sowing of winter wheat last year, and laying the foundation for this year's bumper harvest.

This brigade is also very active in using advanced experiences such as rational close planting and rational fertilization, so that the level of cultivation has been greatly improved compared with before communization.

In field management, this brigade established professional teams and a responsibility system, with one person per ten mu, one member (technician) per hundred mu, and one work area per thousand mu. According to the growth of wheat seedlings, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers were applied three times during the returning green, jointing, booting, and grain filling stages.

Wang Lao Jia Brigade also overcame the difficulty of fertilizer shortage and defeated wheat rust with the spirit of self-reliance. This brigade established 44 local fertilizer plants, built 210 manure pools in the fields, and stored nearly 10,000 dan of green manure. At the same time, they also purchased 350,000 dan of human and animal manure and soil fertilizer from commune members. This is 23 times more fertilizer than was accumulated in 1957, and it was transported to the fields in time, so that each mu of wheat field had 100 dan of base fertilizer, changing the past situation where less base fertilizer was applied and rational topdressing was not possible due to the lack of fertilizer. This brigade's 1,800 mu of wheat suffered from severe rust disease in May this year, but because the team built five lime kilns and burned 28,000 jin of lime, plus the commune allocated a portion of sulfur, lime and sulfur were used as medicines to promptly eliminate the rust disease. The prevention and treatment time was more than doubled compared to 1957 before communization, when 1,200 mu of wheat were affected by rust disease.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th – The good news of low yield turning into high yield has spread from Mangshan Ridge in Henan. The experimental field of Changhua People's Commune in Mengjin County, located on the ridge, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat this year. The 403 mu of wheat in the entire field, after careful harvesting and threshing, averaged 687 jin per mu. Among them, 105 mu, after separate harvesting and threshing, averaged 1,036 jin and ten taels per mu.

This experimental field is located on the top of Mangshan Mountain, with a lack of water sources and a groundwater level below eight or nine zhang; the soil is barren, with red soil mixed with gravel, and the water retention capacity is very low. The masses describe the natural conditions there as follows: "Red soil gravel slope, drought and clods, nine disasters in ten years, heavy rain washes away gullies." Before liberation, this land could only harvest a hundred or so jin of wheat per mu at most. After liberation, production increased year after year, reaching an average of 210 jin per mu last year. This year, due to the further strengthening of leadership by the commune Party committee and the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in the experimental field, a large area of high-yield production appeared on this red soil plateau, which has always had very low yields.

This experimental field is operated by the Tenth Production Team of Changhua Commune, and Wu Fuxiang, a provincial agricultural labor model, is in charge of the experimental field. The whole team has 32 households, 67 male and female full and semi-laborers, and 27 livestock. Only during busy times do local cadres help with some work. Other conditions are almost the same as other production teams. When planting wheat last year, they were determined to raise a large-scale high-yield red flag on Mangshan Ridge, and put forward the slogan of "Hard work and skillful work for two hundred days, strive for one season to be worth one year." They generally deep-plowed the land to a depth of nine inches to one chi, achieving "moving the living soil, turning over the dead soil, not disrupting the soil, and applying fertilizer in layers." After plowing, they immediately hoeed the corners of the field, hoeed the edges, picked up autumn stubble, and broke up clods; then they used a long-toothed harrow (seven inches) to rake diagonally twice, hooked up the weeds and crushed the soil; then used a medium-toothed harrow (three inches) to rake once along and once across; finally used a short-toothed harrow (half an inch) to rake once along and across, achieving "the land is as flat as a mirror, the soil is as fine as flour, the top is loose and the bottom is solid, preserving moisture and resisting drought." At this time, according to the principle of rational close planting, they sowed 30 jin of excellent wheat seed – Bima No. 1 – per mu. After sowing, according to the requirement of "fertilizer in command," they vigorously developed field manure ponds, processing the road soil dug out, the pond mud dug out, and the manure picked up into fine fertilizer for topdressing. Now, in the head of this experimental field, there is a manure pond every ten steps or so, with a total of ninety-six, each pond can hold fifty dan of manure. In addition, there are twenty-seven water cellars, which were also used in accumulating fertilizer, each cellar can hold 300 dan of fertilizer; these fertilizers are composted with the water stored in the cellars, coarse fertilizer, human and animal manure, etc., and are very fertile. They used these fertilizers to generally apply topdressing three to five times, amounting to 3,500 jin to 4,200 jin per mu, plus the topdressed chemical fertilizer and base fertilizer, amounting to 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.

During the mid-tillage management, they seized the elimination of third-class seedlings. "Eccentric fertilizer" was applied to the third-class seedling land, so that the third-class seedlings quickly upgraded and reached the point where each piece of seedlings was flourishing. In the late stage management of wheat fields, they seized the prevention of insect pests, lodging, frost, wind, and the prevention of trampling by humans and animals, and did not reduce production due to natural disasters.

Now, the commune members of this experimental field are joyfully planting wheat stubble autumn crops and hoeing early autumn crops, striving for a greater harvest in the autumn.

    大丰收来自大挖潜力
    解放妇女家务劳动使田间劳动力大为增强
    认真改进耕作技术使红壤土也能大片增产
    光武公社六千多亩小麦亩产四百七十多斤
    长华公社四百多亩小麦亩产六百多斤
    据新华社合肥20日电　安徽省界首县光武公社王老家大队在挖掘劳动潜力和提高农业技术的基础上，获得了大面积丰产。该队六千一百八十八亩小麦经过验收核实，平均亩产四百七十二斤二两，比去年增产一倍以上。其中有十三亩丰产田，平均亩产一千零三十斤。
    王老家大队历来是人少地多，每个男女劳动力要担负十三亩耕地，加上全大队有三千七百多亩淤土地，雨后保墒时间短，历年都不能适时下种。去年公社化后，八百多名妇女摆脱了家务劳动，参加了田间生产，解决了部分劳力不足，保证了去年冬小麦适时趁墒下种，为今年的丰收奠定了基础。
    这个大队在运用合理密植，合理施肥等先进经验方面也很积极，从而使耕作水平比公社化前有了很大的提高。
    在田间管理上，这个大队成立专业队，建立了责任制度，做到十亩一人，百亩一员（技术员），千亩一个作业区，并根据麦苗生长情况，在返青、拔节、孕穗、灌浆期间分别追了三次氮肥、磷肥、钾肥。
    王老家大队还以自力更生的精神，克服了肥料不足的困难和战胜了小麦锈病。这个大队举办了四十四个土化肥厂，在田头建立了二百一十个粪池，储存了近一万担绿肥。同时还从社员家购买人畜粪、土肥等三十五万担。比1957年所积肥料多二十三倍，而且及时运到田里，使每亩麦田有基肥一百担，改变了过去由于肥料少而少施基肥和不能合理追肥的情况。大队一千八百亩小麦在今年5月份发生严重锈病，但是由于该队自建了五个石灰窑，烧石灰二万八千斤，加上公社调拨了一部分硫磺，用石灰和硫磺作药剂，及时扑灭了锈病。比公社化前1957年发生一千二百亩小麦锈病的防治时间加快了一倍以上。
    新华社郑州20日电　从河南邙山岭上传出了低产变高产的喜讯。孟津县长华人民公社设在岭上的试验场，今年小麦获得了空前大丰收。全场四百零三亩小麦，经过细收细打，平均每亩产量达到六百八十七片。其中有一百零五亩，经过单收单打，平均亩产一千零三十六斤十两。
    这个试验场处在邙山之巅，水源缺乏，地下水位在八、九丈深以下；土质贫瘠，红壤中杂有?礓，保水能力很低。群众这样形容那里的自然条件：“红土?礓坡，干旱坷垃多，十年九灾害，雨大冲沟壑。”解放以前，这里每亩地顶多能收百十斤麦子，解放后连年增产，到去年每亩产麦平均达到二百一十斤。今年，由于公社党委进一步加强了领导，在试验场中认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，因此，在这产量一向很低的红土高原上，出现了大面积高额丰产。
    这个试验场由长华公社第十生产队负责经营，省农业劳动模范吴福祥担负试验场的领导工作。全队共三十二户，男女整半劳力六十七人，牲畜二十七头，只是在大忙时候，当地干部才帮助作些活，别的条件几乎和其它生产队相同。去年种麦时，他们决心要在邙山岭上树起大面积丰产红旗，提出“苦干巧干二百天，力争一季顶一年”的战斗口号，普遍将地深翻了九寸至一尺多，作到了“活土搬家，死土翻身，土翻不乱，分层施肥。”翻地后，随即耪地角，锄地边，拾秋茬，打坷垃；然后又用长齿耙（七寸）斜耙两遍，钩净杂草粉碎土块；再用中齿耙（三寸）顺耙一遍，横耙一遍；最后用短齿耙（半寸）顺横各耙一遍，达到“地平如镜，土碎如面，上虚下实，保墒耐旱”。这时，他们根据合理密植原则，每亩地播下了三十斤优良麦种——碧蚂一号。播种后，又根据“肥料挂帅”的要求，大搞地头茅池，将起出来的路土、挖出来的塘泥、拾的粪，加工成细肥追施。现在，这个试验场的地头上，每隔十来步远就有一个茅池，共有九十六个，每池可容纳粪肥五十担。另外，还有二十七个水窖，在积肥时也被利用起来，每窖可容纳肥料三百担；这些肥料是用水窖的积水和粗肥、人粪尿等一块沤成的，肥力很强。他们利用这些肥料，普遍施追肥三至五次，每亩合三千五百斤至四千二百斤，再加上追施的化肥和底肥，每亩合肥料两万来斤。
    中耕管理期间，他们抓紧了消灭三类苗。在三类苗地上追施了“偏心肥”，使三类苗迅速升级，达到块块苗旺。麦田后期管理中，抓紧了防虫害、防倒伏、防霜、防风、防止人畜糟踏，没有因为自然灾害而减产。
    现在，这个试验场的社员们正欢欣鼓舞地种植麦茬秋收作物和锄早秋作物，力争秋季获得更大丰收。
