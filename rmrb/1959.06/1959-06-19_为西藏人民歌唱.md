    At the People's Liberation Army's Second Literary and Art Performance Conference, the Song and Dance Troupe of the Political Department of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, from the Tibetan Plateau, was particularly welcomed and respected.
    For several years, they have been active on the Tibetan Plateau, serving the troops stationed in Tibet and the Tibetan people wholeheartedly. After the Tibetan rebellion, they experienced days of combat with the Tibetan people. In the cheers of the victory of the suppression of the rebellion, they enthusiastically sang the new life of the Tibetan people.
    On the day that the Lhasa rebellion was completely crushed, Zhang Junfei, the head of the Song and Dance Troupe, was so excited that he didn't sleep all night. He led four or five people to write a skit under the lights reflecting the doomsday of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, and the victory of the Tibetan people. At a rally of more than 30,000 people in Lhasa celebrating the victory of the suppression of the rebellion, the Song and Dance Troupe members sang and danced, singing the new life of the Tibetan people:
    The severe winter has passed,
    The cuckoo is singing loudly,
    The sun dispels the dark clouds,
    Good fortune descends on Tibet.
    …
    Let us sing to our heart's content,
    Sing the new life of Tibet,
    Sing the savior Communist Party.
    The serfs who had been liberated from whips and sticks had never been so excited or moved. After a program was over, there was thunderous applause and cheers from the audience, shaking the valley. The serfs, who had been oppressed for generations, shouted loudly for the first time, "Yarm! Yarm!" (Good! Good!) and danced exuberantly to the music on the stage.
    This Song and Dance Troupe, deeply loved by Tibetan compatriots, has been active on the Tibetan Plateau since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Once, they set off from Lhasa to perform in Yadong. Under the slogan of "Don't let go of a village, don't let go of a sentry post," they stopped at every village along the way, whether it was a large village with hundreds of people or a small village with three or five households, to give慰问 performances. Sometimes they traveled 180 li in a day and night, performing three shows in a row without rest. During the construction of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, they ate, lived, and worked with the Tibetan people. After working all day, they would go to the birch forest with their Tibetan brothers and sisters to light bonfires, eat fried highland barley and fried peas, and dance and sing to their heart's content.
    In March 1953, these literary and art fighters performed skits in Qushui, Langkazhi, Gyangze, Xigaze, Yadong, Gelinggang and other places, reflecting the Tibetan people's resistance to British imperialist aggression against Tibet in 1904. This incident is still fresh in the memory of the older Tibetans. More than forty years ago, they personally witnessed the bloody crimes of British imperialist troops killing, setting fires, looting property, and destroying temples. Many people shed tears after watching the skits. An 83-year-old man named Gelang Baiji from Yadong, who participated in the anti-British struggle that year, gave the bow and arrow he used to bravely resist the British invaders forty-nine years ago to the Song and Dance Troupe. He said, "Now we have the People's Liberation Army to protect us, we don't need it anymore. Please transfer it to Beijing to be kept as a souvenir for the motherland!"
    The literary and art fighters who wholeheartedly serve the Tibetan people have established a deep friendship with the Tibetan people over the years. Whenever the members of the Song and Dance Troupe carried props, costumes, and musical instruments and traveled across mountains and rivers to perform for the Tibetan people, the Tibetan people would rush to use yaks to bring them things, vying to let them live in houses and tents, and warmly entertain them. In the summer of 1951, the Song and Dance Troupe followed the troops entering Tibet to Taizhao, east of Lhasa, to conduct propaganda. In a remote and poor mountain village, they worked on the one hand and helped the Tibetans graze cattle, milk cows, collect firewood, and fetch water on the other hand, establishing friendship with the residents of the village. When the Song and Dance Troupe was about to leave, the families in the mountain village stayed up all night. They fried highland barley, baked sesame cakes, and prepared walnuts and dried apricots to send off the Song and Dance Troupe. When the Song and Dance Troupe set off, the whole village came to see them off.
    These literary and art fighters are not only singers of the new life of the Tibetan people, but also organizers and preservers of the Tibetan folk art heritage. From the first day they entered Tibet, they enthusiastically learned songs and dances from the Tibetan people. Whenever they arrived in a place, they would visit Tibetans, record Tibetan operas, and then perform them to the Tibetans after sorting them out. In Lhasa, the Song and Dance Troupe invited local folk artists Amai Re, Dorje, Zaxi Dunzhu, and Annie (female) as teachers to teach Nangma, Duixie, and Tibetan opera, which were almost lost.

    为西藏人民歌唱
    新华社记者　冶峰  徐学增
    在解放军第二届文艺会演大会上，来自西藏高原的中国人民解放军西藏军区政治部文工团特别受到人们的欢迎和尊敬。
    几年来，他们一直活跃在西藏高原，全心全意地为驻藏部队和西藏人民服务。西藏叛乱事件发生后，他们同西藏人民一起经历了战斗的日子。在平叛胜利的欢呼声中，他们又热情地歌唱藏族人民的新生。
    拉萨叛乱被彻底粉碎的当天，文工团团长张俊飞兴奋得一夜没睡觉，领导着四、五个人在灯光下编写了一个反映原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的末日与西藏人民胜利的活报剧。在拉萨市一次三万多人庆祝平叛胜利的大会上，文工团员们载歌载舞，欢唱着西藏人民的新生：
    严寒的冬天过去了，
    布谷鸟在大声欢唱，
    阳光驱散了乌云，
    吉祥降临在西藏。
    ……
    让我们尽情地歌唱吧，
    歌唱西藏的新生，
    歌唱救星共产党。
    从皮鞭、棍棒下解放出来的农奴们，从来没有这样兴奋过，激动过。一个节目演完了，台下掌声雷动，欢呼声震山谷。受了几辈子压迫的农奴们，第一次这样宏亮地高呼着：“亚姆！亚姆！”（好！好！）并且随着台上的音乐奔放地跳起舞来。
    这个深受藏族同胞热爱的文工团，从和平解放西藏以来，一直活跃在西藏高原上。有一次，他们从拉萨出发，到亚东去演出，在“不放过一个村庄、不放过一个兵站”的口号下，在千里途中不管是经过几百人的大村，还是遇到三、五户的小庄，村村停下来进行慰问演出。他们有时一昼夜走一百八十里，连演三场不休息。在修建康藏、青藏公路期间，他们同藏族人民同吃同住同劳动，白天劳动了一天，晚上还同藏胞兄弟姐妹们到白桦林中点燃起篝火，吃着炒青稞和炒豌豆，尽情地舞蹈和歌唱。
    1953年3月，这些文艺战士们在曲水、朗嘎子、江孜、日喀则、亚东、格林岗等地演出了藏族人民在1904年反对英帝国主义侵略西藏的活报剧。这件事在年老的藏胞中记忆犹新。四十多年前，他们亲眼看到英帝国主义的军队杀人放火、抢劫财物、破坏寺庙等血腥罪行。许多人看了活报剧流出了眼泪。亚东一位当年参加过反英斗争的八十三岁的格浪白吉老人，将他四十九年前英勇抗击英国侵略军使用的弓箭，赠给了文工团。他说：“现在有解放军保护我们，用不着它了，请你们转到北京给祖国留作纪念吧！”
    全心全意为西藏人民服务的文艺战士们，几年来同西藏人民建立了深厚的友情。每当文工团团员们背着道具、服装和乐器，跋山涉水为西藏人民演出时，藏族人民就赶来用牦牛给他们送东西，争着让房子和帐篷给他们住，并且热情地招待他们。1951年夏天，文工团随着进藏部队到达拉萨以东的太昭一带进行宣传，在一个偏僻穷困的山村里，他们一面工作，一面帮着藏民放牛挤奶，拾柴打水，同村里的居民们结下了友谊。文工团临别时，山村里的人家彻夜不眠，他们炒好青稞，烙好油饼，准备了胡桃和杏干，给文工团送行。文工团出发时，全村的人都来欢送。
    这些文艺战士们，不仅是西藏人民新生活的歌唱者，而且是藏族民间艺术遗产的整理和保存者。他们从进入西藏的第一天起，就热情地向藏族人民学习歌舞。每到一地，他们就拜访藏民，将藏族戏曲记录下来，经过整理后再演唱给藏民们看。在拉萨市，文工团邀请了当地的民间艺人阿麦惹、多吉、扎西顿珠和安尼（女）等为老师，来传授几乎将要失传的囊玛、堆谢和藏戏。
