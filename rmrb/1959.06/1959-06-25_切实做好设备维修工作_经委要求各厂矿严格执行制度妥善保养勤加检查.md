Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: The State Economic Commission recently convened a conference on equipment maintenance and spare parts production.

The conference pointed out that in modern enterprises, doing a good job in equipment maintenance and spare parts production is an important task to ensure safe production, improve equipment efficiency, and promote production leaps forward. All industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises must conscientiously strengthen equipment maintenance and repair work, establish and implement regular equipment maintenance and repair systems, and achieve proper maintenance, diligent inspection, and regular overhaul. In terms of maintenance, the main focus is on strengthening the technical management of equipment, specifying the maximum load and wear limits of equipment, constantly educating employees to abide by operating procedures, correctly using and caring for equipment, organizing mass equipment maintenance propaganda education and appraisal competitions, and strengthening technical training for new workers and apprentices. In terms of repair work, it is necessary to restore and establish equipment repair procedures, strictly implement the system of regular repairs, and not postpone the repair period casually in order to rush tasks. All industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises must mobilize the masses to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the damage and defects of existing equipment, and take effective measures to solve the problems found in the inspection. Special attention should be paid to issues related to getting through the summer, preventing rain, and preventing lightning, and these should be addressed as early as possible.

In order to do a good job in equipment maintenance, all factories and mining enterprises should improve the full-time organizations for managing mechanical equipment, equip them with capable personnel, and effectively manage the work of equipment maintenance and repair.

The conference believes that the repair and assembly plants of various departments and the repair workshops of enterprises should clearly define the policy of serving production and truly take on the task of repair and assembly. The original repair and assembly plants and repair workshops should continue to undertake repair and assembly tasks. Whenever there is a conflict between manufacturing tasks and machine repair tasks, the machine repair tasks should take precedence. Various departments and regions may, according to their specific needs and characteristics, designate several factories, equipment, and personnel to establish necessary repair bases or repair teams specifically responsible for the repair tasks of their affiliated enterprises. In repair work, all factories, mines, enterprises, departments, and regions should fully demonstrate the spirit of mutual cooperation and support, and try to fix reasonable repair cooperation relationships as much as possible.

This conference also studied the active organization and arrangement of the production of spare parts, strengthening cooperation in the production of spare parts, and appropriately resolving the materials required for repairs and spare parts, and proposed corresponding measures.

The conference believes that strengthening equipment maintenance and the production and supply of spare parts is a long-term and regular task. The leaders of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises must give it constant and sufficient attention. They must resolutely rely on and mobilize the masses, and closely integrate this work with daily production. Only in this way can this work be done well.

    经委要求各厂矿严格执行制度妥善保养勤加检查
    新华社24日讯　国家经济委员会最近召开设备维修和备品配件生产会议。
    会议指出，在现代化企业中，做好设备维护和备品配件生产，是确保安全生产、提高设备效率、促进生产跃进的一项重要工作。所有工矿、交通企业都要认真加强对设备的维护检修工作，建立和贯彻执行经常的设备保养和维修制度，做到妥善保养，勤加检查，定期检修。在维护工作方面，主要是加强对设备的技术管理，规定设备的最高负荷和磨损限度，经常教育职工遵守操作规程，正确地使用设备和爱护保养设备，组织群众性的设备保养宣传教育和评比竞赛，加强对新工人和学徒的技术训练。在检修工作方面，要恢复和建立设备的检修规程，严格执行定期检修的制度，不能因为赶任务而随便推迟检修的期限。各工矿、交通企业都要发动群众对现有设备的损坏和缺陷情况，进行一次普遍的检查，针对检查中发现的问题，采取有效措施加以解决，特别对过夏，防雨、防雷等有关问题，应及早注意处理。
    为了做好设备的维修工作，各厂矿企业都应该健全管理机械设备的专职机构，配备得力人员，切实地把设备维护检修的工作管起来。
    会议认为，各部门的修配厂和企业的修理车间，都应当明确为生产服务的方针，真正把修配任务担当起来。原来的修配厂和修理车间应当继续担任修配任务。凡制造任务和机修任务有矛盾的，应当服从机修任务。各部门和各地区，可以根据具体需要和本身的特点，划出若干工厂、设备、人员，建立必要的检修基地或检修队伍，专门担负所属企业的检修任务。各厂矿企业和部门、地区之间，在检修工作中，应该充分发挥相互协作和支援的精神，并且尽量将合理的检修协作关系固定下来。
    这次会议还研究了积极组织安排备品配件的生产，加强备品配件生产中的协作，以及适当解决检修和备品配件所需的材料等问题，并且提出了相应的措施。
    会议认为，加强设备维修和备品配件的生产和供应是一件长期的经常性的工作，工矿交通企业领导必须予以经常的足够的重视，要坚决依靠和发动群众，把这一工作和日常生产紧密结合起来，只有这样，才能把这个工作做好。
