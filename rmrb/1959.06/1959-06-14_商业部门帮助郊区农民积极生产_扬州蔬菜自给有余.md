Our newspaper Nanjing, 13th dispatch: Yangzhou's commercial departments are actively helping suburban areas develop vegetable production. Recently, they launched a "Six Helps" campaign to ensure a steady supply of vegetables to the city. Since the end of May, the average daily market supply of vegetables in the city has reached more than 130,000 catties. Including the self-produced and self-sufficient portion in the urban area, the average person can eat more than one catty of fresh vegetables every day. In the past two or three months, they have also supported neighboring areas with more than 8.5 million catties of vegetables.

The "Six Helps" campaign not only guarantees the current vegetable supply but, more importantly, helps the suburbs solve long-term production problems. The commercial departments actively provide appropriate assistance and guidance to the suburbs in terms of production planning, seeds, fertilizers, tools, and even advanced planting techniques, which provides favorable conditions for a large increase in vegetable production in the future. The content of the "Six Helps" campaign is as follows: First, actively help the communes formulate vegetable production plans, so that the area and yield of vegetable planting are implemented in the production teams. The ratio of self-sufficient production to commercial production is rationally arranged. Appropriate arrangements have been made for the varieties of coarse and fine vegetables and the time of market supply to achieve staggered sowing, phased harvesting, balanced marketing, and evergreen throughout the four seasons. The second is to help solve the problem of seed shortage. In accordance with the spirit of "self-reliance as the main factor and regulatory supply as the auxiliary factor," they purchased vegetable seeds from commune members with cash, helped communes and teams adjust among themselves, and solved more than 10,000 catties of seeds locally. At the same time, they purchased a batch of high-quality varieties from other places and added more than 40 new varieties, such as cabbage from Inner Mongolia, large peppers from Jilin, sword beans from Yunnan, and butternut squash from Changchun. The third is to help solve the fertilizer problem. After the vegetable seeds were supplied, some communes lacked fertilizer, and the vegetables did not grow well. The commune members said: "The leaves are yellow, the stems are thin, and the plants are short. No one loves them in the fields. Without fertilizer, they won't grow fat, and they will look even worse when sent to the market." Under the leadership of the municipal party committee, the commercial departments immediately allocated some chemical fertilizers to support key areas and contacted the health departments to ensure that most of the urban manure was used for vegetable fields, completely solving the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer. The fourth is to help solve various production materials and tools. Such as supplying glass and reed mats for warm bed seedling cultivation, flatbed carts and vegetable baskets for transporting vegetables, hui windows for processing dried and salted vegetables, and firewood racks, etc., to ensure smooth production. The fifth is to help improve vegetable production technology. In addition to assisting the communes in forming technical research groups, they also organized production technicians to visit Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places to learn advanced planting experiences in warm bed seedling cultivation, field management, and technological innovation. The sixth is to help solve the problems of funds and labor. They signed pre-purchase contracts with various communes, paid some pre-purchase funds to communes with insufficient production funds, and mobilized urban vendors and employees to go to the countryside to help rush planting, harvesting, and transporting vegetables.

In order to adapt to the seasonal production and perennial needs of vegetable supply, they adopted the method of "both fresh and dry, adjusting between peak and slack seasons." While grasping fresh vegetable production, they organized agencies, organizations, communes, and residents to process and pickle the surplus vegetables on the market, to achieve "supplementing the slack season with the peak season, preventing spoilage in the peak season, and ensuring continuous supply in the slack season," which played a significant role in supporting the needs of cities and industrial and mining areas.

    商业部门帮助郊区农民积极生产
    扬州蔬菜自给有余
    本报南京13日电　扬州市商业部门主动帮助郊区发展蔬菜生产，最近开展了一个“六帮助”活动，保证郊区蔬菜源源不断地供应城市。5月底以来，全市平均每天蔬菜上市量达到十三万多斤，加上市区自产自给部分，平均每人每天可吃到一斤以上的新鲜蔬菜。近两、三个月，还支援了友邻地区八百五十多万斤蔬菜。
    “六帮助”活动不仅是保证了眼前蔬菜的供应，更重要的是帮助郊区解决了长远的生产之计。从生产规划、种子、肥料工具以至先进的种植技术等方面，商业部门都主动地给予郊区以适当的帮助和指导，这就给今后大量增产蔬菜提供了有利的条件。“六帮助”活动的内容是：一、主动帮助公社制订蔬菜生产规划，使蔬菜种植的面积、产量落实到生产队，合理地安排了自给性生产与商品性生产的比例，并对粗、细菜品种和上市时间，进行了适当安排，做到排开播种、分期出土、均衡上市、四季常青。第二是帮助解决缺种问题。他们根据“以自力更生为主、调剂供应为辅”的精神，一面以现金收购社员家里的菜种，帮助社社和队队之间进行相互调剂，就地解决了一万多斤种子。同时，又向外地采购了一批优良品种，并增加了四十多种新品种，如内蒙古的包菜，吉林的大椒，云南的刀豆，长春的南燔瓜。第三是帮助解决肥料问题。蔬菜种子供应下去后，有些公社缺少肥料，蔬菜生长不好，社员说：“叶黄茎瘦个子矮，长在田里无人爱，没有肥料长不胖，送到市里更变样。”商业部门在市委领导下立即拨出部分化学肥料重点支持，并与卫生部门联系，确定城市粪肥大部用于菜田，彻底解决了肥料不足的困难。第四是帮助解决生产上的各种材料、工具。如供应温床育苗的玻璃、芦席，运菜的板车、菜篮，加工干咸菜用的荟窗以及架柴等，保证生产顺利进行。第五是帮助提高蔬菜生产技术。除协助公社组成技术研究小组外，还组织生产技术人员到南京、上海等地参观学习温床育苗、田间管理、技术革新等先进的种植经验。第六是帮助解决资金、劳力问题。他们分别与各公社签订了预购合同，对生产资金不足的公社，适当付给部分预购款，同时又动员城市商贩、职工下乡帮助抢种、起菜、运菜。
    为了适应蔬菜供应上的季节性生产和常年需要的特点，他们采取了“干鲜并举、旺淡调剂”的办法，一边抓鲜菜生产，一边对市场供应有余的蔬菜，发动机关、团体和公社、居民加工腌制，做到“以旺补淡、旺季不烂、淡季不断”，对支持城市和工矿区的需要、起了很大的作用。
