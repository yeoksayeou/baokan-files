Editorial: The Coal Industry Must Leap Forward in All Aspects

On the basis of the great leap forward last year, China's coal industry has achieved great results again this year. From January to May this year, coal production increased by 109.9% compared with the same period last year. More than 400 coal mining faces across the country, including all the working faces of the six mining bureaus of Kailuan, Fushun, Xishan, Fengfeng, Hebi, and Jiaozuo, have reached the target of a large-scale harvest of 10,000 tons of coal per month; among them, nearly 40 working faces have reached the level of 20,000 to 30,000 tons per month. Thirteen of the 28 major mining bureaus in the country have won the red flag for large-scale high yield. At present, the task of all employees in the coal industry is to advance victoriously, make persistent efforts, and comprehensively improve the management level of enterprises to meet the requirements of high-yield and high-quality production.

The coal industry occupies an extremely important position in the national economy. At present, China's production of oil and natural gas is not large, and fuel for industry and transportation is mainly coal. At the same time, coal is also an important raw material for the chemical industry. Therefore, this year's leap forward in all industries such as steel, electricity, chemical industry, light industry, and handicrafts, as well as transportation, requires the coal industry to produce more coal and produce good coal. With the development of agricultural mechanization, the relationship between coal and the development of agricultural production is also growing. At present, there are a large number of gas engines and portable boilers across the country, which require a large supply of coal to irrigate fields and drain waterlogged areas. In addition, the amount of coal used for the livelihood of more than 600 million people is also very large. Cooking consumes a lot of coal every day; coal is even more indispensable for heating in winter. During China's first five-year plan, coal used for means of livelihood accounted for about 40% of coal production. Compared with the needs of various sectors of the national economy, this year's coal production is quite tight. If coal is not produced in sufficient quantity and quality, it will be difficult to guarantee this year's leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the need for coal for people's livelihood. Therefore, coal production has become a crucial link in the entire national economy. Employees in the coal industry must, in the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, go all out, comprehensively improve the management level of enterprises, produce balanced and safe production, and produce more coal and good coal.

There are two different ways to increase coal production. One is to simply pursue the amount of coal mining, concentrating manpower and equipment on the working face, relaxing tunneling (in underground mines) or stripping (in open-pit mines). The result is that although coal production has increased, the number of reserve working faces has decreased. If this continues for a long time, the mine will face the danger of a sudden drop in production or even complete abandonment. The other way is to seize coal mining on the one hand, and seize tunneling and stripping on the other, striving to achieve balanced production at a relatively high production level. Many coal mines have done this now, and as a result, production has increased, and the number of reserve working faces has also increased accordingly, so production is relatively balanced. Some mines, because the production increased too fast, the tunneling or stripping work did not keep up, and the connection between the two is somewhat strained or disjointed. However, these mines can improve in the short term as long as measures are taken. The more serious is the third type of mine. In these mines, there is a relatively serious disconnection between coal mining and tunneling or stripping work, which has affected production. Although this type of mine accounts for a small number of coal mines across the country, they have raised an important lesson, that is, the high production level achieved by abnormal, rush methods, that is, only focusing on coal mining and ignoring tunneling or stripping, cannot be consolidated. Based on this situation, the Ministry of Coal Industry recently made appropriate adjustments to the current work, and decided to vigorously strengthen tunneling or stripping work in terms of manpower, material resources, and leadership while maintaining normal production levels. This can not only increase coal production and meet this year's national economic needs for coal, but also strengthen production preparation and lay a good foundation for next year's production. All coal mines should adopt a positive attitude and quickly strengthen tunneling or stripping work to make the situation of the first type of mine more stable, so that the second type of mine rises to the first type of mine, and strive to eliminate the third type of mine. However, no matter which type of mine, coal mining should not be relaxed in these months. Some mines have relatively tight allocation of manpower and material resources, and they should also try their best to maintain normal production levels. If it is absolutely necessary, do not reduce production too much. Because more coal must be produced in the third quarter to ensure the needs of all parties for coal in the fourth quarter. Tunneling or stripping work can have a greater increase in the fourth quarter. This is the issue that should be given priority in the coal industry at present.

Secondly, attention should be paid to improving the quality of coal. At present, the quality of raw coal produced by some mines is not good, and the stone content is relatively high; the quality of refined coal produced by some coal washing plants is also not good, and the ash content is high. Poor coal quality will affect the quality of iron smelting, the firepower of power generation, and the speed of trains; and will cause a waste of a lot of manpower, material resources, and transportation capacity. For example, if the stone content of coal to be transported by railway this year increases by 1%, 2 million tons of stone will occupy 70,000 train cars to travel around the country throughout the year. If the ash content of refined coal increases by 1%, pig iron production will decrease by 2.86%. It can be seen that the economic significance of improving coal quality is very significant. Based on the past indicators of coal quality that have been achieved, it is entirely possible to reduce the current stone content of coal by 1% and the ash content of refined coal by more than 1%. In order to achieve this quality requirement on the basis of balanced production, coal mines and coal washing plants need to improve the institutions and rules and regulations for inspecting coal quality as soon as possible; they must educate employees to improve coal quality; they must mobilize workers and technicians to innovate coal mining, tunneling, stripping, and coal washing and coal selection methods, and especially to seriously promote the effective "three selections and four no's" created by the masses over the years (three selections are to select stone on the working face, at the wellhead, and in the coal yard; four no's are that stone should not be put on shovels, on slides, on mine cars, and on trains). Some enterprises lack the capacity of coal preparation equipment and need to take active measures to solve it.

Thirdly, efforts must be made to achieve safe production. Coal mines are underground operations, often threatened by natural disasters such as water, fire, gas, and silica and coal dust. If safety work is not paid attention to, accidents such as casualties of workers will occur, and it will not be possible to achieve rhythmic and balanced production increases. Since liberation, coal mines across the country have conscientiously implemented the policy of safe production, formulated a series of systems to ensure the safety of workers, and taken many measures in ventilation, fire prevention, and water prevention, and achieved great results and accumulated rich experience. However, recently, some enterprises have relaxed safety work, causing unnecessary losses. This is absolutely not allowed. Leading comrades of all coal mines must attach great importance to safe production, must understand that accidents caused by relaxing safety work are dereliction of duty and criminal behavior, and must list the fight against accidents as their top priority and regular task. Therefore, all coal mines must quickly strengthen the leadership of safe production, deeply mobilize the masses, and adopt the method of combining leadership and the masses to establish and improve various necessary rules and regulations, especially to strictly implement operating procedures on coal mining and tunneling working faces. At the same time, it is also necessary to establish and improve the organization of safety supervision agencies and mass supervision networks, so that specialized safety supervision work is combined with mass supervision work, and the work of safe production is truly done well.

The three tasks mentioned above are the focus of the current work of the coal industry sector. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen equipment maintenance and in-mine transportation. Because coal enterprises are composed of links such as tunneling, mining, transportation, hoisting, and loading, these links promote and restrict each other. In order to comprehensively improve the management level of enterprises and make production balanced, safe, high-yield, and high-quality, it is necessary to strengthen the above-mentioned tasks at the same time.

The tasks of the coal industry sector are arduous and very glorious. Leading comrades at all levels in the coal industry should work more seriously, deeply, and meticulously, further mobilize the enthusiasm of all employees, give full play to the rich creativity of the workers, and achieve a comprehensive leap forward. At the same time, since increasing coal production is currently a key link related to the leap forward of the entire national economy, other economic sectors must give strong support to the coal industry. In particular, the metallurgical, machinery manufacturing, forestry, and other industrial sectors and transportation departments should supply the materials and equipment required by the coal industry on time, in quantity, in sets, and in quality according to the state plan. This is to create conditions for the leap forward of the coal industry, and also to create conditions for ensuring the leap forward of the entire national economy. We hope that everyone will pool their efforts and jointly strengthen this "pioneer" sector of China's industry.

### 煤炭工业要全面跃进

    煤炭工业要全面跃进
    我国煤炭工业在去年大跃进的基础上，今年又取得了很大的成绩。今年1至5月份的煤产量，比去年同期增长了109.9％。全国有四百多个采煤工作面，包括开滦、抚顺、西山、峰峰、鹤壁、焦作等六个矿务局所有的工作面，达到了月产万吨煤的大面积丰收的指标；其中有近四十个工作面达到了月产两三万吨的水平。全国二十八个重要矿务局中有十三个矿务局获得了大面积丰产红旗。目前，煤炭工业部门的全体职工的任务是：乘胜前进，再接再厉，全面地提高企业的管理水平，达到高产、优质的生产要求。
    煤炭工业在国民经济中占着极为重要的地位。目前我国石油和天然气的产量不多，工业和交通运输业的燃料主要是煤炭。同时，煤还是化学工业的重要原料。因此，今年我国的钢铁、电力、化工、轻工业和手工业等一切工业，以及交通运输业的跃进，都要求煤炭工业必须多产煤，产好煤。随着农业机械化的发展，煤对发展农业生产的关系也愈来愈大了。目前全国有大批的煤气机和锅驼机，需要供应大量的煤炭，来灌溉田地，排除渍涝。此外，六亿多人民的生活用煤，数量也是很大的。做饭天天要消耗大量的煤炭；冬天取暖，煤炭更不可少。我国第一个五年计划期间，用于生活资料的煤约占煤产量的40％左右。而今年煤炭的生产量同国民经济各部门的需要量相比，是相当紧的。如果煤炭生产得不够多，不够好，就难于保证今年工农业生产的跃进和人民生活用煤的需要。因此，煤炭生产已成为当前整个国民经济中关键性的环节了。煤炭工业部门的职工必须根据党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，鼓足干劲，全面地提高企业的管理水平，均衡地安全地生产，多产煤、产好煤。
    增产煤炭可以有两种不同的做法。一种是单纯追求采煤量，把人力和设备集中使用在工作面上，放松了掘进（在井下矿）或剥离（在露天矿），其结果是煤产量虽然提高了，但后备的工作面减少了，长此下去，这个矿就会发生产量突然下降以至完全报废的危险。另一种做法是一方面抓紧采煤，一方面抓紧掘进和剥离，力求做到在比较高的生产水平上均衡生产。现在，有很多煤矿这样做了，结果产量提高了，后备工作面也相应增加了，因而生产比较均衡。还有些矿，由于产量提高得快，掘进或剥离工作没有跟上去，两者的衔接有些紧张或脱节。但这类矿只要采取措施，短期内就可以好转。比较严重的是第三类矿。在这些矿里，采煤和掘进或剥离工作发生了比较严重的脱节现象，生产受到了影响。这类矿虽然在全国煤矿中占少数，但是它们却提出了一个重要的经验教训，即用不正常的突击性的方法，即只顾采煤、不顾掘进或剥离的方法所达到的高产水平，是巩固不住的。根据这个情况，煤炭部最近对当前工作进行了适当的调整，决定在保持正常生产水平的条件下，从人力、物力和领导方面，大力加强掘进或剥离工作。这样做，既可以增加煤炭生产，满足今年国民经济对煤炭的需要，又可以加强生产准备，为明年的生产打下良好的基础。所有煤矿都应采取积极的态度，迅速加强掘进或剥离工作，使第一类矿的情况更加稳定，使二类矿上升为一类矿，力求消灭三类矿。但是，无论那一类矿，在这几个月里，都不可放松采煤工作。有些矿人力、物力的调配比较紧张，也应尽力维持正常的生产水平，万不得已时也不要减产过多。因为必须在第三季度生产出较多的煤炭，才能保证第四季度各方面对煤炭的需要。掘进或剥离工作可以在第四季度有较大幅度的增长。这是煤炭工业中当前应当首先注意的问题。
    其次，应当注意提高煤的质量。目前有些矿生产的原煤质量不好，含?（石头）率比较高；有些洗煤厂生产的精煤质量也不好，含灰分较多。而煤质不好，就要影响炼铁的质量、发电的火力和火车的行速；而且会造成大量人力、物力和运输力的浪费。例如，今年要用铁路运输的煤炭中，如果含?率增加1％，全年就要有二百万吨石头占用七万辆车皮周游全国。精煤灰分每升高1％，生铁便要减产2.86％，可见提高煤质的经济意义是很大的。根据过去煤炭质量已经达到的指标，把目前煤炭的含?率降低1％，把精煤的灰分降低1％以上，是完全可以做到的。为了在均衡生产的基础上达到这个质量要求，各煤矿和洗煤厂需要尽快地健全检查煤质的机构和规章制度；要在职工中进行提高煤质的教育；要发动工人和技术人员革新采煤、掘进、剥离和洗煤选煤的方法，特别要认真推广群众多年来创造的行之有效的“三拣四不上”（三拣就是在工作面上、井口上、煤场上拣?石；四不上就是?石不上锹，不上溜子，不上矿车，不上火车。）的经验。有些企业选煤设备能力不足，要积极采取措施，加以解决。
    再次，必须努力做到安全生产。煤矿是地下作业，经常受水、火、瓦斯和矽、煤尘等自然灾害的威胁，如果不注意安全工作，就会发生职工伤亡等事故，也不能达到有节奏的、均衡的增产。解放以来，全国煤矿认真执行了安全生产的方针，制定了一系列的保证职工安全的制度，在通风、防火、防水等方面采取了许多措施，取得了很大的成绩，积累了丰富的经验。但是，最近以来，有的企业放松了安全工作，造成了不应有的损失。这是绝对不能容许的。所有煤矿的领导同志必须十分重视安全生产，必须了解因放松安全工作而造成的事故是玩忽职守的犯罪行为，必须把同事故作斗争列为自己的头等重要的经常任务。因此，所有煤矿必须迅速加强对安全生产的领导，深入发动群众，采取领导与群众相结合的办法，建立和健全各种必要的规章制度，特别是在采煤和掘进工作面上要严格执行作业规程。同时还必须建立健全安全监察机构和群众性的监察网的组织，使专门性的安全监察工作与群众性的监察工作结合起来，把安全生产的工作真正作好。
    上面所说的三项工作，是目前煤炭工业部门工作的重点。除此以外，还需要加强设备维修和矿内运输等工作。因为煤炭企业是由掘、采、运、提、装等环节组成的，这些环节是互相促进互相制约的。为了全面地提高企业管理水平，使生产均衡、安全、高产、优质，必须同时加强上述各项工作。
    煤炭工业部门的任务是繁重的，同时也是十分光荣的。煤炭工业的各级领导同志应当更加严肃地、深入地、细致地进行工作，把全体职工的积极性进一步调动起来，发挥职工群众的丰富的创造力，实现全面的跃进。同时，由于增产煤炭是目前关系到整个国民经济跃进的关键环节，因此其他的经济部门必须给煤炭工业以大力的支持。特别是冶金、机械制造、森林等工业部门和交通运输部门，应该按照国家计划，按时、按量、按套、按质供应煤炭工业所需要的材料和设备。这是为煤炭工业的跃进创造条件，也是为了保证整个国民经济的跃进创造条件。我们希望大家群策群力，共同把我国工业的这个“先行”部门加强起来。
