According to a report from the Southern Daily: The Lianghua Commune in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, is vigorously accumulating high-quality fertilizer based on the characteristics of the rice paddies in the area. In the past ten days or so, the fertilizer accumulated by the whole commune has been universally applied once to more than 1,000 mu of early rice crops of the third category and has prepared some fertilizer for late rice crops.

The work of accumulating high-quality fertilizer in this commune was carried out on the basis of mobilizing the masses and carefully summarizing the experience of fertilizer accumulation and application last year. In early May, the Party Committee of the Lianghua Commune held symposiums for veteran farmers in units of large teams, respectively, to sum up the successful experiences of fertilizer accumulation during the Great Leap Forward last year. At the symposiums, the veteran farmers unanimously believed that Lianghua is located in a mountainous and semi-mountainous area, and most of the fields are cold and acidic. The experience over the years has proved that lime, Celtis sinensis ash, green manure, and artificial urine are the best fertilizers for this type of field.

The Lianghua Commune has crisscrossing rivers and ditches, surrounded by overlapping mountains and lush weeds, with an inexhaustible supply of green manure. The reserves of limestone and phosphate rock are abundant. After the commune's Party Committee relied on the veteran farmers to specifically summarize the successful experiences of fertilizer application in the past, it immediately mobilized the masses to massively accumulate and produce artificial urine, burn Celtis sinensis ash and lime, and collect green manure. The commune members saw that the cadres were following the mass line, summarizing and promoting their historically effective experience in fertilizer accumulation and application, and everyone was overjoyed and actively participated in the fertilizer accumulation campaign. Six hundred and seventy commune members from the Shiwuliao Brigade voluntarily signed up to participate in the lime-burning expedition team to burn lime in Laoshan, thirty miles away. The whole commune had 1,733 people, forming 66 shock teams to burn Celtis sinensis ash. In the past ten days, they burned more than 2,800 dan of Celtis sinensis ash. (Attached picture)

Lake grass is a very good fertilizer. The fertilizer accumulation teams of various people's communes in the Dongting Lake area cut a large amount of lake grass from the lake continent and transported it to the fields through canals.

    惠阳梁化公社总结去年经验
    因地制宜积肥造肥
    据南方日报消息　广东惠阳县梁化公社根据本地区稻田的特点，大力积集质量良好的肥料。近十多天来，全社积到的肥料，已给一千多亩早造三类禾普遍追施一次，并为晚造准备了一部分肥料。
    这个公社积集优质肥的工作，是在发动群众，认真地总结了去年积肥、施肥的经验基础上开展起来的。5月初，梁化公社的党委会以大队为单位分别召开老农座谈会，总结去年大跃进中积肥的成功经验。在座谈会上，老农们一致认为：梁化这个地方属于山区和半山区，大多数田土是冷底和含酸性的。历年的经验证明，石灰、青树灰、绿肥、人造尿等，是这类田最好的肥料。
    梁化公社境内河沟纵横，四周山岭重叠，杂草丛生，绿肥取之不尽。石灰石、磷矿石储量丰富。公社党委依靠老农，具体地总结了过去用肥的成功经验以后，立即发动群众大量积制人造尿、烧制青树灰、石灰和采摘绿肥。社员们看到干部走群众路线，总结和推广了他们素来行之有效的积肥、施肥的经验，人人心花怒放，积极投入了积肥运动。石屋寮大队六百七十个社员，自动报名参加烧石灰的远征队，到三十里外的老山去烧石灰。全社有一千七百三十三人，组成了六十六个烧青树灰的突击队，十天来共烧青树灰二千八百多担。（附图片）
    湖草是一种很好的肥料。洞庭湖滨各人民公社的积肥专业队，从湖洲上砍回大量湖草，通过渠道运到田边。
