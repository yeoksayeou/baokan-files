On Exertion
Zhou Guoquan

Many typical materials illustrate that in some places, there is a significant difference between the existing labor force and the number of workers required by production plans. How to solve the problem of insufficient labor has become a major issue related to whether the leap forward plan can be realized.

There are two different views on how to deal with this problem. One is to act according to the number of people, setting the target based on the available labor. The result is only a reduction in production targets. This is a "cutting the feet to fit the shoes" approach, a regressive approach. The other view is the opposite: we should start with tapping potential, finding shortcuts, and improving labor efficiency so that the labor force meets the requirements of the leap forward plan. This is a striving-for-progress approach, a promoting approach.

Can this promoting approach be realized? Let's first look at the four typical examples recently introduced in the Shanxi Daily.

The first is a typical example of hard work. Li Tianzhu of the Pingshun Town People's Commune in Huguan County worked 615 labor days last year, doing the work of two people. His experience mainly involves two things: first, a "red heart," having vigorous revolutionary drive; second, "industriousness," never wasting time, never walking empty-handed (such as carrying manure to the fields and carrying soil back home), scientifically arranging work and rest.

The second is a typical example of smart work. Li Rui, a 53-year-old farmer from the Fenghao Management Area of the Xinghua People's Commune in Fenyang County, who came from a long-term worker background, created and reformed 22 kinds of tools, 306 pieces in total, saving more than 4,100 man-days and more than 1,900 animal-days. That is, the man-days saved by one person's inventions and creations in one year are equivalent to the annual labor of 13 or 14 people (calculated based on 290 to 300 labor days per person per year). The saved animal power is equivalent to that of six livestock. In addition, he personally worked 550 labor days and trained more than 20 young technicians.

The third is a typical example of cadres taking the lead. Zhang Jiangkao, the production team leader of the Xigou Jinxing People's Commune in Huguan County, works in the fields, working and working at the same time. As a result, he worked more than 610 labor days in a year. All other work is done very well.

The fourth is a typical example of collective work. The Yuehua Management Area of the Yellow River People's Commune in Ruicheng County has a total of 440 male and female full and semi-laborers. Last year, each person worked an average of 403 labor days, which is equal to 161% of the original plan (an average of 249 labor days per person), more than one and a half times the original.

These four examples show that as long as things are done well, each method can increase labor days by half, one time, several times, or even ten times. If these methods are correctly combined and utilized, the aforementioned promoting approach can be fully realized.

Originally, these methods are not isolated but are mutually reinforcing and mutually promoting.

The relationship between hard work and smart work is essentially the relationship between cold and heat, the relationship between revolutionary drive and scientific attitude. As the saying goes, "Suffering breeds wisdom, wisdom breeds skill, and skill breeds strength." This is the dialectic of hard work and smart work. Hard work, that is, "diligence," has always been the glorious tradition of our working people. Now, in order to build a great socialist motherland, hard work (or "diligence") is still very important. However, the hard work we are talking about is by no means simply increasing labor intensity and extending working hours, but is combined with smart work, including improving production tools and improving labor organization. Li Tianzhu's hard work is combined with cleverly arranging working hours and researching and creating deep plows, high-line transportation, and so on. The smart work we are talking about is by no means easy to obtain but must go through hard work. Li Rui thought of smart work (thinking about improving tools) only after hard work; he achieved smart work only after hard work (such as staying up all night studying diligently). It can be seen that hard work and smart work are mutually integrated and mutually promoting. Hard work makes people generate the desire for smart work, and the practical experience of hard work also provides the possibility of realizing smart work. Smart work is produced on the basis of hard work and creates conditions for achieving the goal of hard work (such as improving labor productivity and accelerating socialist construction). Without smart work, hard work cannot last long and cannot achieve higher labor productivity; without hard work, smart work is like a tree without roots and water without a source. Therefore, the correct attitude should be to work hard and work smartly.

The significance of cadres taking the lead is very significant and must not be underestimated. Cadres taking the lead can not only change the view of belittling physical labor created by the exploiting classes for thousands of years and change social customs but also improve leadership skills. Zhang Jiangkao's experience is: "Whether you are the director of a senior cooperative or the captain of a commune, the main task is to lead the masses to do a good job in production. If production is done well, it guarantees that your work is done well; if production is not done well, it means that your work is not done well." Countless experiences prove that to lead production, you must participate in production, share weal and woe with the members, work together, and rest together. In this way, you can closely connect with the members, hear the members' criticisms and suggestions in time, and discover and solve problems in time. Cadres taking the lead is by no means just taking the lead in hard work, but more importantly, taking the lead in smart work, taking the lead in inventing and creating good tools, and implementing advanced measures. As the saying goes, "How can you get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's lair?" Therefore, only by personally participating in production can you grasp the various aspects of crops, lead production according to the specific situation, and sum up advanced production experience through production practice. In recent years, cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians have been combined in many areas to plant experimental fields and reform tools, achieving great results. This is a good form of cadres taking the lead.

Collective work is a superiority inherent in the people's commune. Collective work can produce a new productive capacity higher than decentralized work, that is, collective productive capacity. The people's commune, in terms of its production scale, is large-scale production, with thousands of households, tens of thousands of people, and tens of thousands of acres of land. However, in terms of its daily production activities, it is not mechanized large-scale production but decentralized small-scale production, with a dozen people, several people, or even individuals working. In this way, it is necessary to arrange all laborers in appropriate positions under a unified plan. A collective, whether it is a commune, a management area, or a production team, has many people, men, women, old people, children, people with strong physical strength, people with weak physical strength, and so on. For these people, work should be assigned according to their abilities, making the best use of their talents. The Yuehua Management Area of the Yellow River Commune in Ruicheng County implements a system in which those who are physically weak are not assigned to those who are physically strong, those who are old and young are not assigned to those who are young and strong, and women are not assigned to men. Completely liberate all the labor force that has not been liberated and let them participate in social production. Compress personnel who do not directly participate in production as much as possible and replenish the front line. In production, establish a responsibility system, so that everyone has work to do and everyone has a responsibility. In this way, every worker will do a good job in his or her position and contribute to the collective. At the same time, the implementation of this method of rational division of labor and cooperation based on the division of labor under centralized leadership will make people pay attention to studying their business. As the saying goes, "Practice makes perfect." As long as attention is paid to mobilizing everyone to come up with ideas, think of solutions, pool the wisdom of the masses, and implement collective smart work, a technical revolution can be launched on a large scale.

Hard work, smart work, cadres taking the lead, and collective work are different links in a chain. We must select the central link according to local conditions and time, grasp the central link, and drive the entire chain. In this way, the problem of labor shortage can be solved, and the realization of the leap forward plan can be promoted.

    谈干
    周国权
    许多典型材料说明：有些地方现有劳动力和生产计划用工数相差很多。如何解决劳力不足的问题，已成为目前关系到跃进计划之能否实现的一个大问题。
    对待这个问题，有两种不同的主张。一是因人办事，有多少劳力，定多大指标。结果只有降低生产指标，这是削足适履的主张，是促退的主张。另一种主张则与此相反：要从挖潜力、找窍门、提高劳动效率着手，使劳动力适于跃进计划的要求。这是力争上游的主张，是促进的主张。
    这种促进的主张能否实现呢？让我们先看看最近山西日报上介绍的四个典型事例。
    第一个是苦干的典型。壶关县平顺镇人民公社李天柱，去年作了六百一十五个劳动日，一人顶两人作活。他的经验主要有两条，一是“心红”，有旺盛的革命干劲；二是“人勤”，时不空过，路不空行（如下地担粪，回家担土），科学安排，有劳有逸。
    第二个是巧干的典型。汾阳县杏花人民公社冯郝沟管理区五十三岁的老农李锐，长工出身，一年创造发明和改革工具二十二种，三百零六件，节省四千一百多人工，一千九百多畜工，即一个人一年因发明创造工具所节省的人工顶十三、四个人全年的劳动（按每年每人劳动二百九十到三百个劳动日计算），所节省的畜工，也顶六个牲口。此外，他本人还作了五百五十个劳动日，培养了二十多个青年技术员。
    第三个是干部带头干的典型。壶关县西沟金星人民公社生产队长张江考，到田间办公，边劳动，边工作，结果一年作了六百一十多个劳动日。其他工作样样都作的很好。
    第四个是集体干的典型。芮城县黄河人民公社岳华管理区，共男女整半劳动力四百四十人，去年每人平均作了四百零三个劳动日，等于原计划（每人平均作二百四十九个劳动日）的161％，一人顶一个半人还多。
    这四个例子说明，只要搞的好，每一个办法都可以使劳动日增加半倍、一倍、几倍，以至十几倍。要是把这些办法正确地结合起来加以利用，上述那种促进的主张是完全可以实现的。
    本来，这些办法就不是孤立的，而是相辅相成，互相促进的。
    苦干和巧干的关系，实质上就是冷和热的关系，革命干劲和科学态度的关系。俗话说，“苦中生智，智能生巧，巧能生力”，这就是苦干和巧干的辩证法。苦干，即“勤”，向来就是我国劳动人民的光荣传统。现在，为了建设伟大的社会主义祖国，苦干（或者说“勤”），仍然是十分重要的。但是，我们说的苦干，决不只是增加劳动强度，延长工作时间，而是同巧干，包括着改进生产工具，改善劳动组织等等结合起来的。李天柱的苦干，就结合着巧妙的安排劳动时间和研究创制深耕犁、高线运输等等。我们说的巧干，决不是轻而易举就能得到的，而是必须经过苦干。李锐就是经过苦干，才想巧干（想改进工具）；经过苦干（如彻夜不眠的刻苦钻研），才达到了巧干。可见，苦干和巧干是互相渗透、互相促进的。苦干，使人们产生巧干的愿望，苦干的实践经验，也提供了实现巧干的可能；巧干，是在苦干的基础上产生的，又为实现苦干的目的（如提高劳动生产率，加速社会主义建设等）创造了条件。没有巧干，苦干就不能持久，就不能达到更高的劳动生产率；没有苦干，巧干就是无本之木，无源之水。因此，正确的态度应该是，既要苦干，又要巧干。
    干部带头干的意义，是十分重大的，绝不能低估了。干部带头干，不仅可以改变几千年来剥削阶级造成的轻视体力劳动的观点，改变社会风尚，而且可以提高领导能力。张江考的体会是：“不管是高级社的主任，还是公社的队长，工作任务主要是带领群众把生产搞好。生产搞好了，保证你的工作做的好；生产搞得不好，那就说明你的工作没做好。”无数的经验证明：要领导生产就必须参加生产，与社员同甘共苦，同劳动，同休息。这样，就能密切与社员的联系，就能及时听到社员的批评和建议，就能及时发现问题、解决问题。干部带头干，决不只是带头苦干，而重要的是带头巧干，带头发明创造好的工具，实行先进的措施。常说，“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”？所以，只有亲身参加生产，才能掌握作物各方面的情况，才能根据具体情况领导生产，才能通过生产实践，总结先进的生产经验。近几年来，广大地区采用了干部、老农、技术员三结合的方法，种试验田，搞工具改革，收到了巨大的成绩。这是干部带头干的一种好形式。
    集体干，是人民公社所具有的一种优越性，集体干，就能产生出一种比分散干更高的新的生产能力，即集体的生产能力。人民公社，就其生产规模来说是大生产，几千户，几万人，数万亩地，但是，就其日常的生产活动来说，还不是机械化的大生产，而是分散的小生产，十几个人，几个人，甚至单个人在劳作。这样，就需要在统一计划下把所有的劳动者安排到适当的岗位上。一个集体，不论是公社，还是管理区或生产队，都有许多人，男人，女人，老人，小人，体力强的人，体力弱的人，等等，对这些人，就要因人派活，人尽其才，芮城县黄河公社岳华管理区就是实行体力弱的人能干的，不派体力强的，老年、少年能干的，不派青年、壮年，女的能干的，不派男的；对一切没有解放出来的劳动力，彻底解放出来，使其参加社会生产；对非直接参加生产的人员，要尽量压缩，充实第一线；在生产中，建立责任制，人人有活干，人人有责任。这样，每个劳动者就会在自己的岗位上作好工作，为集体贡献力量。同时，实行这样集中领导下的合理分工和分工基础上的合作的办法，就会使人们注意钻研业务。常说，“熟能生巧”，只要注意发动大家出主意，想点子，群策群力，集思广益，实行集体的巧干，就能大闹技术革命。
    苦干、巧干、干部带头干和集体干，是一个链条的不同环节。我们要因地、因时地选择中心环节，抓住中心环节，带动整个链条。这样，就能解决劳动力紧张的问题，就能促进跃进计划的实现。
