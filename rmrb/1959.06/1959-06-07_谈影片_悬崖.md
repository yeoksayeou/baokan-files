Discussing the Film "Cliff"
Yang Tianxi

"Cliff" is a film with the theme of modern Chinese intellectuals. It attempts to depict the different paths taken by three different types of intellectuals in China's socialist construction through the conflicts in life ideals between Fang Qing, Fan Jun, and Yuan Sichen. It also aims to portray the Party's leadership and education of intellectuals. Therefore, studying the problems existing in the film is beneficial for how to correctly, vividly, and profoundly portray the image of intellectuals, love issues, and the Party's leadership and education of intellectuals in the future.

Fang Qing in the film is a young intellectual full of bourgeois thoughts and feelings. In order to gain fame, she did not hesitate to sell her love. Later, after the Party's education, she went to the fishermen's area to train and transform herself, and her thoughts and actions changed. The film depicts her bourgeois thoughts and feelings in a relatively detailed way. In the beginning, she was just organizing manuscripts for her teacher Yuan Sichen, wanting to learn more from it. When Yuan Sichen, with ulterior motives, took the opportunity to let her perform surgery, the two became closer. Fang Qing also hoped to write a book like Yuan Sichen. Because Yuan Sichen showed a complete rogue appearance in front of her, she once broke up with him and returned the manuscript to him under some pretext. But there was still a lingering connection between them. Even though her former lover Fan Jun sent her precious gifts from the grasslands at this time, and she also noticed that her female classmate Zhang Xiaoyan had a strong affection for Yuan Sichen and was already organizing manuscripts for him, she still sold her cheap love to Yuan Sichen when he proposed to promote her to teaching assistant. When Yuan Sichen wrote his and her names on the cover of the manuscript, Fang Qing was completely satisfied with this collusion, agreeing that it was the crystallization of their so-called love. In order to publish the book as soon as possible, Fang Qing obeyed Yuan Sichen's orders to do experiments day and night, resulting in serious dereliction of duty, almost causing a sick child to die. The film depicts the so-called love between them with layers, twists, and ups and downs, showing Fang Qing's bourgeois thoughts and feelings and portraying some activities in her heart. At the same time, the film also shows Fang Qing's pain of being trapped in the mud and asks the Party to give education. The Party member in the film, Sister Han of the department office, also criticized her thoughts. Later, Fang Qing went to the fishermen's area, worked very hard, and once said to Fan Jun that she was educated by getting along with the fishermen. Unfortunately, all of this is expressed very emptyly and superficially in art, and cannot leave any impression on the audience.

What is particularly worth discussing is the film's attitude towards the character of Fang Qing. Fang Qing is a young intellectual who just graduated from university. The film begins by depicting her with serious bourgeois thoughts. Because she was relatively naive, she was once lured and played with by Yuan Sichen. When she discovered that his rogue appearance was fully exposed, she immediately avoided contact with him, which is understandable. However, when she willingly colluded with Yuan Sichen, the situation was very different from before. I feel that she was no longer naive at this time, because she already knew that Yuan Sichen was a rogue, Sister Han, a Party member in the department, had also advised her, and she was even given a major demerit by the administration for dereliction of duty. Despite this, she still abandoned her original lover Fan Jun and insisted on loving Yuan Sichen, organizing manuscripts, and even getting married. At this time, Fang Qing's problem was no longer a general bourgeois thought, but involved morality and character! For such a character, the film should have more seriously criticized her thoughts. However, on their wedding night, when Zhao Wen revealed Yuan Sichen's theft, the film only focused on showing her bewilderment and pain, making people feel that her mistake was not a matter of morality, but only because of naivety, weakness, and being temporarily deceived. Perhaps due to this point of view, the film cannot see how Fang Qing was specifically educated by the fishermen in the fishermen's area, in life and struggle. Therefore, I think the film's handling of Fang Qing's character is unstable, which hinders the film from deeply portraying this character and also weakens the film's educational effect.

Yuan Sichen's character can be said to be a hypocrite and a bourgeois cultural rogue. He not only steals the labor achievements of others, but also lures and plays with his own students, and his dirtiness and obscenity are unspeakable. The film attempts to show this kind of decadent bourgeois senior intellectual, thereby despising this kind of hypocrite and rogue. Comrade Chen, the person in charge of the surgery department in the film, criticized and accused Yuan Sichen; when Zhao Wen revealed the truth about his theft, it aroused public indignation, demanding that he be immediately sent to the court for punishment, and the leadership also agreed with the opinions of the masses. However, these criticisms and accusations are simple and empty.

Fan Jun's image appears in the film as a positive character. However, the ins and outs of this character's thoughts and feelings are not very clear. We don't know what the basis of his ideological progress is. Since he and Fang Qing could not share the same ideals before leaving school, why was he so reluctant to part with Fang Qing? What did he think of Fang Qing, and what were his plans? Later, when he witnessed Fang Qing marrying Yuan Sichen, he actually left in anger. Was it because of jealousy, or what? In short, we only see Fan Jun saying correct things and doing some work, but we don't understand this person.

From the above images, I feel that the film is more vivid and detailed in depicting Fang Qing and Yuan Sichen's bourgeois thoughts and feelings, and more empty and conceptual in expressing Fang Qing's transformation, Fan Jun's inner world, and spiritual outlook. Sister Han and Doctor Chen are just characters who specialize in preaching to these people, having a voice but no shape.

"Cliff" has serious shortcomings and even some mistakes from the script to the film
(The shortcomings and mistakes in the script are more serious, and the film has been revised to some extent), but I think these all belong to the category of creative ideas. The scriptwriter and production staff also tried to write and film them well, but because they did not stand firmly on the position of the working class, problems arose (of course, some problems in the film were also formed due to patching). Therefore, it cannot be said to be a white flag or poisonous weed. It is different from the rightist Lü Ban's maliciously anti-Party and anti-socialist "Unfinished Comedy."

Of course, we cannot ignore the seriousness of the existing problems and should seriously discuss them. From the creation of "Cliff," we can see a fundamental principle of depicting intellectuals, which is to express them from the perspective and position of the working class. When we describe intellectuals with strong bourgeois thoughts like Fang Qing, we should not sympathize, condone, or even praise their erroneous thoughts, but we must write about how they combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers in the revolutionary furnace, transform themselves, change their class positions, and become working-class intellectuals. If the film can boldly expose her bourgeois thoughts, especially if it can focus on depicting how she changes and improves her thinking in her work, labor, and struggle, under the influence of the working people, the effect may be better. Characters like Yuan Sichen can be said to be scum in the revolutionary ranks. We must not only expose him, but more importantly, we must deeply criticize him and cleanse his bad influence among the masses. The current treatment in the film lacks the critical power of artistic images and is not necessarily appropriate.

Expressing the transformation of intellectuals in the revolutionary ranks inevitably involves the leadership of the Party and the appearance of Party members. However, it is not like this film, as if it is specially for pointing fingers at intellectuals who have not been transformed well at a certain period, but is expressed in their actions of constantly uniting, educating, and transforming them. Perhaps some people will worry that once Party members appear and criticize the ideological problems of intellectuals in a timely manner, the play will be difficult to write. In fact, the transformation of intellectuals is a long and arduous process. It is never possible to become a working-class intellectual overnight, and individual intellectuals like Yuan Sichen will still enter the grave with a granite head despite being educated. Therefore, there is not a lack of material to write about the Party's education, but a lot can be done.

Criticizing and discussing the creative problems in "Cliff" is not for anything else, but to hope that the creators of this film can learn the lessons they should learn from it, so as to create perfect works in the future.

    谈影片“悬崖”
    杨天喜
    “悬崖”是一部以我国现代知识分子为题材的影片。它企图通过方晴、范钧和袁思忱之间的生活理想的矛盾，描写在我国社会主义建设中三种不同类型的知识分子所走的不同的道路，其中也想表现党对知识分子的领导与教育作用。因此，研究一下影片存在的问题，对今后如何正确、生动而深刻地表现知识分子的形象、爱情问题以及党对知识分子的领导与教育，是有益处的。
    影片中的方晴是一个充满了资产阶级思想感情的青年知识分子。她为了沽名钓誉，不惜出卖自己的爱情，后来经过党的教育，才到渔民地区去锻炼、改造，并在思想上和行动上有了转变。影片对她的资产阶级思想感情，描绘得比较细腻。开始，她只是替她的老师袁思忱整理书稿，想从中多学点东西。当袁思忱心怀鬼胎，揽了个机会让她作手术时，他俩就亲近些了，方晴还希望能像袁思忱那样写本书。由于袁思忱在她面前表现出一副十足的流氓相，她曾一度与他决裂，并借故把书稿退还给他。但他们之间还是藕断丝连。尽管这时她以前的爱人范钧从草原上给她寄来珍贵的礼品，她虽然也察觉到了女同学张小燕对袁思忱很有感情，而且已经在为他整理书稿，但是当袁思忱提议升她为助教时，她却仍旧把自己的廉价的爱情出卖给袁思忱。当袁思忱把他和她的名字写在书稿的封面上时，方晴也就完全满足于这种同流合污，同意它是他们所谓爱情的结晶了。方晴为了使书早日出版，听命袁思忱日夜赶做实验，以致严重失职，几乎使一个病儿丧命。影片描绘他俩之间的所谓爱情，是有层次、有曲折、有起伏的，表现出方晴的资产阶级思想感情，刻划出她心灵中一些活动。同时，影片也表现了方晴陷在污泥坑中的苦痛，并要求党给以教育。影片中的党员——系秘书韩大姐也批判了她的思想，后来方晴到渔民地区，在工作上也很努力，并曾对范钧说，她与渔民相处受到了教育。可惜的是这一切在艺术上却表现得非常空洞、表面而不能给观众留下什么印象。
    特别值得提出来探讨的，是影片对方晴这个人物形象的态度。方晴是个刚从大学毕业的青年知识分子，影片开始描写她有着严重的资产阶级思想，由于比较幼稚，曾被袁思忱利诱并玩弄，当她发现他的流氓相毕露无余，马上避免与他接触，这些都是可以理解的。但是，当她甘心与袁思忱同流合污以后，情况就与以前大不相同了，我觉得这时她并不幼稚了，因为她已经明知袁思忱是个流氓，系里党员韩大姐也规劝过她，行政上还因她失职而记她一次大过，尽管这样，她还是抛弃原来的爱人范钧，执意与袁思忱相爱，整理书稿，以至结婚。这时，方晴的问题已经不是一般资产阶级思想，而是涉及到道德、品质问题了！对这样的人物，影片本应更严肃地批判她的思想。可是，在他们新婚之夜，当赵纹揭露了袁思忱的盗窃内幕，影片却只着重表现了她的徬徨、苦痛，使人感到她的错误仿佛不是道德品质上的问题，而只是因为幼稚、脆弱，一时受人愚弄。也可能由于这种观点，影片就看不出方晴在渔民区，如何在生活和斗争中具体地受到渔民的教育。因此，我觉得影片对方晴这个人物的处理是掌握不稳的，从而妨碍影片深入地刻划这个人物形象，也削弱了影片的教育作用。
    袁思忱这个人物可以说是个伪君子、资产阶级文化流氓，他不仅盗窃别人的劳动成果，而且利诱并玩弄自己的学生，其肮脏、下流是无可言喻的。影片是企图表现这种腐朽的资产阶级高级知识分子，从而鄙视这种伪君子、流氓的。影片中外科系的负责同志陈大夫对袁思忱有过批评和指责；当赵纹揭露出他盗窃的实情后，激起了群众义愤，要求立刻送法院惩处，领导上也同意群众的意见，但是，这些批判和指责都是简单的、空洞的。
    范钧这个形象是作为正面人物在影片中出现的，然而，这个人物思想感情的来龙去脉却不很清楚。我们不知道他思想进步的根据是什么。既然他在离校前，与方晴在思想上不能志同道合，为什么他对方晴恋恋不舍？他对方晴如何看法，打算怎样？后来，当他目睹方晴与袁思忱结婚，竟拂袖而去，是因为嫉妒，还是为了什么？总之，我们只见范钧说这样那样正确的话，做了些工作，却不了解这个人。
    从上面几个形象看来，我觉得影片在描写方晴、袁思忱的资产阶级思想感情上比较生动、细腻，表现方晴的转变、范钧的内心世界和精神面貌方面就比较空洞、概念，韩大姐和陈大夫只不过是专门对这些人进行说教的人物，有其声而无其形。
      “悬崖”从剧本到影片都存在着严重的缺点，甚至还有些错误
  （剧本中的缺点和错误更严重，影片中已有所修改），但是，我觉得这都是属于创作思想范畴的问题。剧作者和摄制人员也企图把它们写好、拍好，由于没有站稳工人阶级的立场，结果出了问题（当然，影片中某些问题，也由于打补丁而形成。）。因此，不能说是白旗、毒草，它与右派分子吕班恶意反党反社会主义的“未完成的喜剧”是有区别的。
    当然，我们不能忽视存在的问题的严重性，应该认真来加以探讨。从“悬崖”的创作中，可以看出描写知识分子的一条根本原则，是要从工人阶级的观点和立场去表现他们，我们描写像方晴这样具有浓厚的资产阶级思想的知识分子，对他们的错误思想不是同情、迁就，甚至歌颂他们，而是要写出他们在革命的熔炉中如何与工农兵相结合，脱胎换骨，改变自己的阶级立场，成为工人阶级知识分子。如果影片能大胆地揭露她的资产阶级思想，特别是能着重描写她在工作中、劳动中和斗争中，在劳动人民的影响下，如何使自己的思想有所转变和提高，效果就可能会好一些。像袁思忱这样的人物，可说是革命队伍中的渣滓，我们不仅要暴露他，更重要的是要深刻地批判他，清洗他在群众中的恶劣影响，目前影片中的这种处理，是缺乏艺术形象的批判力量的，而且也是不一定妥当的。
    表现革命队伍中的知识分子的改造，必然要涉及到党的领导，出现党员形象。但是，不是像这部影片这样，好像专门为了到一定时期对未经改造好的知识分子指手划脚，而是表现在他们的行动中如何经常团结、教育、改造他们。也许有人会耽心，一出现党员及时对知识分子的思想毛病进行批评，戏就难以写下去了。其实，知识分子的改造是个长期的艰苦的过程，决不可能一蹴而成为工人阶级知识分子，而且个别知识分子像袁思忱之流，尽管对他进行教育，他还会带着花岗石的脑袋进坟墓的。因此，对党的教育的描写，不是无戏可写，而是大有文章可做。
    批评、探讨“悬崖”中的创作问题，不是为了别的，而是希望这部影片的创作人员从中吸取应有的教训，以便今后创作出完美的作品来。
