Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: TASS, London, June 20th: Khrushchev's speech at the Soviet-German Friendship Rally has elicited a warm response from British newspapers on the 20th. The "Daily Worker," "The Times," and "The Daily Telegraph" published detailed summaries of the speech.

As in the past, some bourgeois newspapers have attempted to distort the true meaning and spirit of Khrushchev's speech. For example, the Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic commentator insisted that the Soviet government leader's speech was "uncompromising" and contained "hidden threats."

However, even some commentators in the bourgeois press, linking Khrushchev's speech to the entire current international situation, particularly the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, made a more objective clarification of his speech. "The News Chronicle" Geneva correspondents Dick and Forrest wrote on the 20th, referring to the decision to temporarily adjourn the Foreign Ministers' Conference: "The door to a high-level meeting remains open, which is precisely what Mr. Khrushchev demanded yesterday."

Other bourgeois newspapers, such as "Daily Mail" reporter Wakeford, emphasized that "Mr. Khrushchev's speech in Geneva is being interpreted as a new appeal for a high-level meeting."

An editorial in the Conservative Party newspaper "Daily Express" also advocated for a meeting of heads of government. The newspaper wrote, why not announce a high-level meeting now, and send the foreign ministers back to Geneva? ... Six weeks of fruitless negotiations in Geneva have proven that: "To achieve success, leaders must personally step up."

Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: TASS, Bonn, June 20th: West German newspapers on the 20th paid close attention to the Soviet-German Democratic Republic People's Friendship Rally held in the Kremlin on the 19th. The newspapers reported Khrushchev's speech at the conference in particularly great detail.

All newspapers excerpted the following passage from Khrushchev's speech: If the Western countries continue to refuse to conclude a peace treaty with the existing two Germanies as in the past, the Soviet Union will have no choice but to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung," "Süddeutsche Zeitung," and other newspapers focused on excerpting such words of the Soviet government leader: After the conclusion of a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, all remnants of occupation still existing in the territory of the German Democratic Republic will be eliminated.

"Westfälische Rundschau" marked in the headline of its report on Khrushchev's speech that West German Chancellor Adenauer's policy is a policy that invites destruction. The newspaper also pointed out that, as the Soviet government leader pointed out, the highest-level meeting will inevitably be held sooner or later, because the people of all countries cannot tolerate the current dangerous situation. In this regard, "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" quoted Khrushchev as saying that once the Geneva Conference fails, a meeting of heads of government will be even more necessary and urgent.

"Stuttgarter Zeitung" pointed out that in Khrushchev's speech, the issue of dates in the Soviet proposal is not a matter of principle and the most important issue, so it cannot be said that the Soviet Union has put forward any ultimatum.

The newspapers also reported on speeches by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, at the conference.

    英国和西德报纸详细报道赫鲁晓夫讲话
    召开高级会议的主张深入人心
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社伦敦20日讯：赫鲁晓夫在德苏友好群众大会上的讲话引起了20日的英国报纸的热烈反应。“工人日报”、“泰晤士报”、“每日电讯报”登载了这个讲话的详细摘要。
    某些资产阶级报纸和过去一样，企图歪曲赫鲁晓夫讲话的真正意义和精神。例如，保守党的“每日电讯报”的外交评论员硬说，苏联政府领导人的讲话是“不妥协的”，而且含有“隐蔽的威胁”。
    不过，甚至资产阶级报纸的某些评论员，把赫鲁晓夫的讲话同目前的整个国际问题、特别是同日内瓦外长会议联系起来，对他的讲话作了比较客观的阐明。“新闻纪事报”日内瓦记者狄克和福莱斯特20日在谈到外长会议临时休会的决定时写道：“通向高级会议的大门仍然开着，这也正是昨天赫鲁晓夫先生所要求的”。
    其他资产阶级报纸“每日邮报”记者韦克福德强调指出，“赫鲁晓夫先生的讲话在日内瓦被解释为对高级会议的新的呼吁”。
    保守党报纸“每日快报”的社论中也主张召开政府首脑会议。报纸写道，为什么现在还不宣布召开高级会议，而再让外交部长回到日内瓦去呢？……六周以来在日内瓦的无结果的谈判证明了：“要想取得成就，领导人就得亲自出马”。
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社波恩20日讯：西德报纸20日非常注意19日在克里姆林宫举行的苏联和德意志民主共和国两国人民友好大会。各报特别详细地报道了赫鲁晓夫在大会上的讲话。
    所有报纸都摘录了赫鲁晓夫讲话中的这样一段话：如果西方国家仍然像过去那样拒绝同现存的两个德国缔结和约，苏联将不得不同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。“法兰克福汇报”，“南德意志报”和其他报纸，都着重摘出了苏联政府领导人的这样一些话：同德意志民主共和国缔结和约后，将消灭尚存在于德意志民主共和国领土上的一切占领残余。
    “威斯特伐利亚评论报”在报道赫鲁晓夫讲话的标题中标出，西德阿登纳总理的政策是招致毁灭的政策。这家报纸还指出，正像苏联政府领导人所指出的那样，最高级会议早晚必将召开，因为各国人民不能容忍当前的危险局势。“法兰克福汇报”在这方面摘引赫鲁晓夫的话说，一旦日内瓦会议遭到失败，政府首脑会议将更为必要和迫切。
    “斯图加特日报”指出了赫鲁晓夫讲话中所说的，日期问题在苏联的建议中不是原则性问题和最重要的问题，所以不能说苏联提出了什么最后通牒。
    各报还报道了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在这次大会上的讲话。
