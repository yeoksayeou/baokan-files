Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Wheat harvesting is progressing rapidly across the country. Most areas south of the Yellow River have completed harvesting, and areas north of the Yellow River have also entered a stage of intense harvesting. People's Commune members in wheat-growing areas, with the support of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, government cadres, and school students, are racing against wind and rain to seize the ripe wheat day and night.

The wheat south of the Yangtze River was harvested by the end of May, and is currently being threshed. Hubei Province, where the wheat ripened earlier, has also basically completed harvesting. Jiangsu and Anhui provinces had nearly completed the rush harvesting work by the 10th. Henan Province, except for some mountainous areas in Luoyang and Kaifeng prefectures, has basically completed harvesting, and over 92% of the cut wheat in the province has been transported to the threshing grounds. Shandong Province is in the midst of a major harvest, and by the 10th, statistics showed that over 18 million mu had been harvested, accounting for about 36% of the province's wheat field area. Prefectures such as Liaocheng, Jining, and Linyi, and counties in the suburbs of Jinan City, have made faster progress, having harvested over 60% to 80%. As of the 9th, Hebei Province had harvested over 12 million mu and threshed over 3 million mu. Shaanxi Province, southern Shanxi, and the suburbs of Beijing have all entered a busy harvest season. Shaanxi mobilizes more than 3 million people every day to rush the harvest, and as of the 8th, statistics showed that the harvested area accounted for 36% of the wheat field area.

Many areas in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins encountered wind and rain during the wheat harvest, and some areas suffered hail. To prevent rain damage and strive for a bumper harvest, all localities have mobilized the entire population to wage a tenacious struggle against the wind and rain. Henan and Shandong provinces each mobilized about 10 million people daily in the rush to harvest, thresh, and transport grain while fighting the wind and rain. Many counties in Shandong Province made two sets of arrangements for sunny and rainy days. On sunny days, they concentrate labor to harvest one area after another. On cloudy and rainy days, the harvested wheat is stacked and covered properly. After the weather clears, the wheat is threshed or ventilated and restacked. Threshed wheat is moved indoors to dry, lowering the temperature and ensuring proper storage.

Due to rushing to harvest in the rain or striving to complete the harvest before the arrival of wind and rain, the harvesting in many areas was relatively rough. It is estimated that there will be a loss of about 10 to 20 jin per mu due to dropped ears and grains or incomplete threshing. In response to this situation, the leadership organs in various localities, while mobilizing the masses to further refine the harvest and threshing, are carrying out re-harvesting and re-threshing of the already harvested wheat, striving to get every grain into the barn.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 11th: More than 6 million farmers in Hebei Province are battling wind, rain, and hail with unparalleled heroism. After several days and nights of hard work, they have rushed to harvest more than 12 million mu of wheat and threshed more than 3 million mu.

Hebei Province encountered continuous rain from the beginning of the wheat harvest. On the 7th, some areas also experienced a level 7 gale and hail. To avoid and reduce losses, People's Communes in various localities concentrated their best manpower to rush to harvest, transport, and thresh. Shexian County originally deployed more than 120,000 laborers for the wheat harvest, which increased to 150,000 in the rainy days. Eight People's Communes in this county formed more than 8,000 professional teams according to the processes of harvesting, transporting, threshing, drying, and storing. In addition, four communes also implemented a contract system that covers everything from harvesting to storage, increasing work efficiency by one or two times.

Jixian, Yutian, and Baodi counties in Tangshan Prefecture and some People's Communes in the suburbs of Tangshan City suffered relatively serious hail disasters. The affected area totaled 410,000 mu, including 280,000 mu of wheat. After the disaster, the members of these areas immediately launched a battle to rush to harvest wheat and replant crops. The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county committees of the affected counties led more than 300 cadres to fight alongside the local members. From the 7th to the 9th, these disaster-stricken areas have replanted and re-sown more than 85,000 mu of field crops damaged by the hail. The Kouzhongzhuang Management Area of the Wangpuzhuang People's Commune in Baodi County had more than 1,000 people sweeping wheat grains in the hail-stricken wheat fields every day, collecting more than 21,000 jin in three days.

People's Communes in various localities are striving to quickly put wheat into storage. Regardless of cloudy or rainy days, the threshing work does not stop. On continuously rainy days, wheat is baked on the stove or near the stove pit, fanned with windmills, or spread out to dry in corridors, dining halls, and classrooms to prevent mildew and sprouting. Members of the Ningjin County communes cut the wheat ears and threshed them in houses, threshing the wheat from more than 12,700 mu of land in two days.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th: The people of Shaanxi are rushing to harvest the ripe wheat day and night in the rain. On the 8th alone, the province mobilized 4.26 million laborers to rush to harvest more than 1.78 million mu of wheat; including previous accumulations, the province has rushed to harvest 8.15 million mu of wheat, accounting for 36% of the total wheat field area.

After receiving the forecast on the evening of the 7th that there would be rain on the 8th, the masses in various parts of Shaanxi Province immediately began to rush the harvest. Chang'an County held a telephone conference at four o'clock that night for emergency mobilization. The next day, the county mobilized more than 156,000 laborers, rushing to harvest 110,000 mu of wheat before the arrival of wind and rain, basically achieving no wheat left in the fields. On this day, the county also launched a campaign to vacate houses. Wangqu People's Commune alone vacated more than 1,000 rooms to store the wheat harvested in the rain. Weinan County mobilized 300,000 laborers, 9,100 large and small carts and bicycles on this day, rushing to harvest more than 95,000 mu of wheat before the rain, bringing back all the ripe wheat. On this day, Xi'an City harvested more than 356,000 mu of wheat, the most harvested day since the summer harvest began. Zhang Ce, First Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Liu Geng, Mayor of Xi'an, also participated in the rush harvest with commune members in the suburbs on this day.

While rushing to harvest, various localities are actively finding ways to thresh. Yangxian County has organized 150,000 laborers, vacating more than 18,000 houses as temporary wheat yards, and threshing indoors on rainy days. Yang Jiuliang, Commissioner of Hanzhong Prefecture, and leading cadres at all levels in Yangxian County personally led more than 800 cadres and more than 14,000 students from the county to help thresh at the production teams day and night in the rain. Xie Village Commune in Yangxian County made a general mobilization, threshing 1,199 dan in one night.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th: Most of the more than 19 million mu of wheat in Jiangsu Province has been rushed to the threshing ground before the wind and rain. It is expected that the wheat harvest will be completed around the 15th.

Based on the current weather characteristics of sunny and rainy weather, the various local committees, county committees and People's Commune party committees in Jiangsu Province have both sunny and rainy plans for the wheat harvest work. When the Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice to prevent rain damage, the provincial agricultural department immediately mobilized all localities via radio to rush to harvest all the ripe wheat before the wind and rain on the 9th. Since the 5th, a climax of rushing to harvest wheat has been set off in the rural areas of the province. The two million labor army in Xuzhou Prefecture completed all the wheat harvest in three days and is rushing to transport it to the threshing ground. Donghai County organized 200,000 people to participate in the rush harvest. Among them, the party secretaries of Baitata, Huangquan, and Tuofeng communes led 10,000 cadres and members, lit more than 400 gasoline lamps, and harvested more than 5,000 mu of wheat overnight. Suzhou Prefecture ranked more than 1.8 million mu of wheat, adopting the method of harvesting one piece and harvesting one piece that is ripe, harvesting and cutting first, cutting, transporting and threshing at the same time. After millions of people rushed to harvest and transport day and night, all of them have now been transported to the threshing ground. Kunshan County, which has more land and fewer people, rushed to harvest 200,000 mu of wheat in three or four days by more than 100,000 cadres and the masses in the county. From the night of the 8th to the morning of the 9th, there was heavy rain in various parts of Jiangsu. In addition to stacking and covering the wheat on the threshing ground, various communes also took various measures to accelerate threshing and dry the wheat indoors to prevent the wheat from getting wet and moldy.

The people of the province's towns and cities also rushed to the countryside to help farmers rush to harvest wheat. More than 50,000 people in Nanjing went to the countryside to cut wheat. More than 200 cadres from the municipal political and legal departments cut more than 180 mu of wheat in Baguazhou in one day. Many factories, enterprises and the People's Liberation Army also took the initiative to organize support teams and went to the countryside.

    北方小麦熟  全民齐抢收
    长江南北各省基本收完开始脱粒
    若干地区复收复打力争减少风雨带来的损失
    新华社11日讯　全国麦收进展迅速，黄河以南大部地区已经割完，黄河以北也进入了紧张的抢收阶段。麦区人民公社社员在人民解放军官兵、机关干部、学校学生的支援下，正和风雨争粮，日夜突击抢收丰收的小麦。
    长江以南的小麦，到5月末即已割完，当前正在脱粒。麦熟较早的湖北省，也已基本收完。江苏、安徽两省到10日止抢收工作已经接近尾声。河南省除洛阳专区和开封专区部分山区外，已经基本收完，全省割倒的小麦已有92％以上运到了场里。山东省正在大收阶段，到10日统计已经收割一千八百多万亩，占全省麦田面积36％左右，进展较快的聊城、济宁、临沂等专区和济南市郊各县已经收了60％到80％以上。河北省到9日已收一千二百多万亩，脱粒三百多万亩。陕西省和山西南部、北京郊区都已进入收割大忙时期，陕西每天出动三百多万人抢收，到8日统计，已收面积占麦田面积36％。
    长江流域和黄河流域许多地区在麦收中遇到了风雨，有的地区遭受了雹灾。为了防止雨害，力争丰产丰收，各地全民动员，和风雨展开了顽强的斗争。河南、山东两省在同风雨争粮的抢收抢打抢运中，每天各出动了一千万人左右。山东省许多县作了晴天、雨天两套安排。晴天，集中劳力熟一片抢收一片；阴雨天，对已收的小麦垛好盖好，天晴后随时脱粒或通风倒垛，已打的小麦在室内倒仓翻晾，降低温度，妥善保存。
    由于冒雨抢收，或力争在风雨到来之前突击割完，不少地区收的比较粗糙，每亩掉穗掉粒或因脱粒不净，估计要损失十斤到二十斤左右。针对这种情况，各地领导机关在发动群众进一步细收细打的同时，对已经收打的小麦，正在开展复收复打，力争颗粒归仓。
    据新华社天津11日电　河北省六百多万农民以无比的英雄气概，同风雨冰雹争粮。经过几天的日夜奋战，已经抢收小麦一千二百多万亩，脱粒三百多万亩。
    河北省麦收开始就遇到了连绵阴雨。7日，部分地区还起七级大风，降了冰雹。为了避免和减少损失，各地人民公社集中精兵健将，抢割抢运抢打。涉县原来投入麦收的劳力是十二万多人，在雨天中就增加到十五万人。这个县有八个人民公社按照割、运、打、晒、藏等工序组成了各种专业队八千多个，另外有四个公社还实行了从割到收到藏一包到底的包干办法，使工作效率提高了一两倍。
    唐山专区的蓟县、玉田、宝坻等县和唐山市郊的部分人民公社，受到了比较严重的雹灾。受灾面积共达四十一万亩，其中小麦二十八万亩。这些地区受灾以后，社员们立即展开了抢收小麦和补种大田的战斗。中共唐山地委和各受灾县的县委率领了三百多名干部，同当地的社员并肩作战。从7日到9日，这些受灾地区已经补种和重种被雹子打坏的大田作物八万五千多亩。宝坻县王朴庄人民公社口中庄管理区每天有一千多人到遭雹灾的麦田中扫麦粒，三天时间就扫起了两万一千多斤。
    各地人民公社都力争小麦迅速入仓，不管阴天、雨天，麦子脱粒工作不停。阴雨连绵天，就在锅台、坑头烘烤小麦，用风车扇麦，或在走廊、饭厅、课堂中摊开晾干，防止霉坏和发芽。宁津县各公社社员把麦穗剪下，在房子里搓、摔，两天中就把一万二千七百多亩地的小麦脱了粒。
    据新华社西安10日电　陕西各地人民群众冒雨日夜抢收已经成熟的小麦。仅8日一天，全省就出动四百二十六万劳力，抢收小麦一百七十八万多亩；连以前累计，全省已抢收小麦八百一十五万亩，占麦田总面积36％。
    陕西省各地群众7日晚接到8日有雨的预报后，立即进行抢收。长安县当夜四点钟召开电话会议，进行紧急动员，第二天，全县共出动十五万六千多个劳力，在风雨来临时抢收小麦十一万亩，基本上做到了黄麦不留。这一天，全县还展开了腾房活动，只是王曲人民公社就腾房一千多间，收藏了雨中收回的麦子。渭南县这一天共出动三十万劳力，九千一百多辆大车、小车和自行车，赶在下雨以前抢收小麦九万五千多亩，把全部成熟的小麦都收回来了。西安市这一天共割麦三十五万六千多亩，是夏收以来割麦最多的一天。中共西安市委第一书记张策、西安市市长刘庚，这一天也和郊区社员们一起参加抢收。
    在抢收的同时，各地积极设法脱粒。洋县已经组织了十五万劳力，腾出一万八千多间房子作为临时小麦场，雨天就在室内脱粒。汉中专区专员杨久良和洋县各级党政负责干部，亲自领导全县八百多名干部、一万四千多名学生，冒雨到各生产队日夜帮助脱粒。洋县谢村公社总动员，一个夜晚就突击脱粒一千一百九十九担。
  据新华社南京10日电　江苏省一千九百多万亩小麦大部分已赶在风雨之前，抢收登场。预计在15日左右麦收就可结束。
    江苏各地委、县委和人民公社党委根据目前天气时晴时雨的特点，对麦收工作都有晴雨两套计划。当农业部发出防止雨害的通知后，省农业部门立即通过电台，紧急动员各地赶在9日风雨之前，把成熟的小麦全部抢收登场。5日开始，全省农村立即掀起了突击抢收小麦的高潮。徐州专区二百万劳动大军，三天中把麦子已全部割完，正在抢运登场。东海县组织了二十万人投入抢收，其中白塔、黄圈、驼峰等公社的党委书记率领万名干部和社员，点起了四百多盏汽油灯，一夜收麦五千多亩。苏州专区把一百八十多万亩小麦排了队，采取熟一块、收一块，先熟先割，边割、边运、边打的办法，经过百万人的昼夜抢收、抢运，现已全部登场。地多人少的昆山县，全县十多万干部和群众，三四天中就抢收小麦二十万亩。8日夜到9日上午，江苏各地普降大雨，各公社除了将登场的小麦堆好盖好以外，还采取各种办法加快脱粒，并在室内晾麦，不使麦子受潮霉烂。
    全省城镇人民也纷纷奔赴农村，帮助农民抢收小麦。南京市有五万多人下乡割麦，市政法部门的二百多个干部在八卦洲一天就割麦一百八十多亩。很多工厂、企业和解放军也都主动组织支援队伍，开赴农村。
