Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 18th - The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting of secretaries of the Party committees of prefectures, cities, and counties in charge of finance and trade, requiring Party committees at all levels to grasp production on the one hand and exchange and distribution on the other, to correctly organize the national economic life.

The meeting summarized the experiences of last year's financial and trade work. The meeting believed that while strengthening leadership over industrial and agricultural production, Party committees at all levels should strengthen leadership over financial and trade work, twisting the three lines into one rope. The meeting decided: When deploying central work, the Party committee should simultaneously deploy the specific tasks of the financial and trade system in conjunction with the central work; a designated person among the Party committee secretaries should be responsible for financial and trade work, regularly discussing and inspecting major issues related to policies and tasks in financial and trade work; strengthen the Party's ideological leadership over financial and trade departments; and enrich and strengthen financial and trade institutions.

Regarding how to do a good job in current commercial work, the meeting, after discussion, believed that it is necessary to grasp the following six aspects:

	(1) Starting from production, organize communes to grow vegetables and raise pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and fish. At the same time, make full use of existing processing equipment, using local materials to vigorously engage in comprehensive processing and comprehensive utilization of non-staple foods, and arrange the market well.

	(2) Urban (including county towns) commercial departments should prominently assist light industry and handicraft departments in arranging the production of daily necessities for the people, solving the supply of industrial raw materials, and further strengthening industrial and commercial collaboration to ensure the normal production of local industries. Wholesale departments should ensure that the supply of raw materials meets the needs of production. Raw materials needed by urban and rural industries should be allocated according to the principle of prioritizing the needs of urban industrial production to promote production.

	(3) Vigorously carry out the purchase of agricultural, sideline, and local specialty products. In this work, commercial departments at all levels should assist communes in classifying and sorting products, formulating product management systems, and dividing which products should be collectively harvested and which products can be harvested by individual members, so as to achieve a division of labor between primary and secondary, arrangement for both large and small, and no omissions of any varieties.

	(4) Inventory stocks, rationally arrange commodities, and do a good job in supply work.

	(5) Resolutely overcome departmentalism, establish a global perspective, obey national planned allocations, and ensure the completion of tasks.

	(6) In order to ensure the continued progress of this year's commercial work, further strengthen political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, and victoriously complete various commercial work tasks, a "Six Goods" socialist labor emulation should be carried out extensively, deeply, and persistently throughout the region. The "Six Goods" are: Good at participating in production and promoting production; Good at actively purchasing and comprehensively completing purchasing and sales plans; Good at obeying allocations and completing export and transfer tasks; Good at expanding sources of goods and arranging market supply; Good at improving management, diligence and thrift; Good at comprehensive processing and comprehensive utilization.

    全面抓生产交换和分配
    广西加强商业工作，正确组织国民经济生活
    当前抓住六个环节开展六好劳动竞赛
    新华社南宁18日电　中共广西僮族自治区委员会最近召开地、市、县委财贸书记会议，要求各级党委一手抓生产，一手抓交换和分配，正确组织国民经济生活。
    会议总结了去年财贸工作的经验。会议认为，各级党委在加强对工农业生产的领导的同时，应该加强对财贸工作的领导，把三条线拧成一股绳。会议决定：党委在布置中心工作的时候，应该同时布置财贸系统结合中心工作的具体任务；党委书记中应有专人抓财贸工作，定期讨论检查财贸工作中有关政策、任务的重大问题；加强党对财贸部门的思想领导；充实和加强财贸机构。
    关于怎样做好当前的商业工作，会议经过讨论，认为需要抓住以下六个环节。
      （一）从生产入手，组织公社种菜和养猪、鸡、鸭、鹅、鱼，同时充分利用原有加工设备，就地取材，大搞副食品的综合加工和综合利用，安排好市场。
      （二）城市（包括县城）商业部门，要突出地协助轻工业和手工业部门安排人民生活用品的生产，解决工业原料的供应问题，进一步加强工商协作，保证地方工业正常生产。批发部门要做到原料供应保证生产的需要，对城市工业和农村工业需要的原料，应本着优先满足城市工业生产需要的原则进行分配，以促进生产。
      （三）大力做好农副土特产品的收购工作。在这项工作中，各级商业部门要协助公社把产品分类排队，制定产品的管理制度，划分那些产品应该集体采摘，那些产品可由社员个人采摘，以便做到主次有分工，大小齐安排，品种不丢不漏。
      （四）清查库存，合理摆布商品，做好供应工作。
      （五）坚决克服本位主义，树立全局观点，服从国家计划调拨，保证完成任务。
      （六）为了保证今年商业工作继续前进，进一步加强政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，胜利完成商业工作各项任务，要在全区范围内广泛、深入、持久地开展“六好”社会主义劳动竞赛。“六好”是参与生产，促进生产好；积极收购，全面完成购销计划好；服从调拨，出口、上调任务完成好；扩大货源，市场供应安排好；改善经营，勤俭节约好；综合加工，综合利用好。
