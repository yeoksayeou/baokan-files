How to Solve the Pig Feed Problem
Wu Jiannong, Deputy Director of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture

Due to the correct implementation of the policy of developing pig raising in our province, the number of pigs is increasing day by day. However, in the development of pig production, many places have also experienced a shortage of feed. We know that if there is a lack of feed, pigs will not grow big or well, and it will be impossible to raise more. Therefore, the lack of feed is a pressing practical problem that needs to be solved urgently.

The approach of "mainly relying on green and roughage, with appropriate supplementation of concentrate feed" is correct. Green grass contains a lot of protein and various vitamins and minerals. Therefore, animal husbandry experts call green grass "complete feed," meaning that the nutrients contained in green feed are very complete. From the perspective of feed sources, green feed is everywhere and very abundant.

This does not mean that raising pigs does not require any concentrate feed at all. A reasonable combination of concentrate feed is very beneficial for fattening pigs.

At present, many pig farms (including some dairy farms) not only lack concentrate feed, but also experience intermittent shortages of green feed. Not only do they rely on supply departments for concentrate feed, but they also reach out to buy green feed. In this way, the lack of main green feed makes concentrate feed even more scarce. This is an approach that relies entirely on others for supplies. In addition, some units adopt the approach of mainly using concentrate feed and supplementing with green feed, relying entirely on rice bran to feed pigs, believing that without rice bran or without a supply of rice bran, pigs cannot be fed. They decide how many pigs to raise based on the amount of concentrate feed available. Both of these approaches do not conform to the principle that pig raising should be based on green feed and that feed must be self-sufficient. As a result, pigs are often not raised well due to lack of feed, and some even die due to lack of feed.

So, how do we solve the problem of feed shortage in pig raising? We believe that to fundamentally solve the feed problem, we must take the following measures:

First, vigorously promote silage. We must deeply recognize that silage is a fundamental measure with strategic significance for the development of animal husbandry. It is called a fundamental measure because pig raising should be based on green feed, and silage can maintain a constant supply of green feed throughout the year, without seasonal shortages. A constant supply of green feed ensures the source of the main feed for pig raising and relatively reduces the pressure on concentrate feed. Silage can improve the quality of green feed. Silage can also save firewood, as it does not need to be cooked when feeding pigs. It is hoped that all production units, especially pig farms and dairy farms, will ensile whatever green feed is available, ensiling during the peak season and using it during the off-season, keeping the silage pits full throughout the year. Wherever this is done, pig production will be proactive; otherwise, it will always be passive.

Second, grow feed. Regardless of public or private raising, we must resolutely implement the instructions on allocating feed land to develop pig production. And allow commune members to reclaim wasteland to grow potatoes and vegetables, provided that it does not affect collective production or hinder soil and water conservation. What should be planted? Both green feed and concentrate feed should be emphasized. Concentrate feed should be emphasized more, such as planting sweet potatoes, potatoes, various beans, pumpkins, and corn. As long as they are planted well, one mu of land can supply the concentrate feed for one pig.

Third, make full use of water surfaces to cultivate high-yielding aquatic feed crops such as water hyacinth, water lettuce, and revolutionary grass. Last year, the Ji'an Trading Company's pig farm used eight mu of water surface to cultivate water hyacinth, which provided the entire year's green feed for more than 1,300 pigs.

Fourth, vigorously establish feed processing factories. All agricultural and sideline products that can be used as feed, such as rice straw, buckwheat stalks, peanut shells, corn cobs, and rapeseed pods, can be processed.

Fifth, transform grasslands and hillsides, sow perennial pastures, and establish permanent pasture bases, which can be used for rotational grazing or cut for silage. This is a basic construction project, and collective pig farms should make long-term plans and actively start working on it. (Attached pictures)

The Zhongzhou Production Team of Longjin Commune in An'yi County, Jiangxi Province, vigorously promoted feed work in pig raising. In addition to cultivating green feed in the feed land, the team and commune members also made extensive use of wild feed. The upper picture shows commune members watering the feed land. The lower picture shows commune members picking wild plants that can be used as feed in the wild.

    如何解决猪饲料问题
    江西省农业厅副厅长　吴剑农
    我省各地由于正确地贯彻执行了发展养猪的政策，猪的数量在日益增长。但在发展生猪生产中，许多地方又出现缺乏饲料问题。我们知道，养猪如果缺乏饲料，生猪一定养不大，也养不好，要想多养更不可能。因此，缺乏饲料是一个急待解决的现实问题。
    “以青绿粗饲料为主，适当搭配精饲料”的作法是正确的。青草里面含有很多蛋白质和多种维生素、矿物质。因此，畜牧学家称青草为“完全饲料”。意思是说青饲料里面所含的营养成分很完全。从饲料来源上来看。青绿饲料遍地皆是，来源非常丰富。
    这并不等于说养猪就完全不需要精料。合理搭配精料，对猪的肥育大有好处。
    目前有许多养猪场（包括有些奶牛场），不但缺乏精料，就是青料也是时断时缺；不但精料要靠供应部门供应，就是青料也是伸手向外购买。这样，主要的青料缺少，就使精料更加紧张。这是一种全部靠别人供应的作法。此外，还有些单位采取以精料为主、青料为辅的作法，平时喂猪全靠米糠，认为没有米糠或者不供应米糠，就不能喂猪；看精料多少来决定自己养多少猪。这两种作法都不符合养猪应以青料为主和饲料必须自给自足的方针。结果，猪往往因为缺饲料养不好，甚至因缺饲料而使猪死亡。
    究竟怎样解决养猪的饲料缺乏问题呢？我们认为要从根本上解决饲料问题，必须采取这样几个办法：
    第一，大抓青贮饲料。我们要深刻认识青贮饲料是发展畜牧生产的一项具有战略意义的根本措施。所以说它是一项根本措施。因为养猪要以青料为主，青贮能保持青料常年供应，四季不缺。青料常年不断，就保证了养猪主要饲料的来源，就相对地减轻了精料的压力。青贮能提高青料的质量。青贮还能节省柴火，喂猪的时候不用煮。希望各生产单位，特别是养猪场、奶牛场，见青就贮，旺季贮、淡季用，常年满窖。哪里做到了这一点，哪里养猪生产就主动，否则，一定经常被动。
    第二，种饲料。不论公养、私养，都必须坚决贯彻执行关于拨饲料地以发展生猪生产的指示。并且允许社员在不影响集体生产、不妨碍水土保持的前提下开荒种薯类和蔬菜。种什么？应该是青料、精料并举。精料应当着重多种些，如种蕃薯、洋芋、各种豆类、南瓜、玉米。只要种得好，一分地就可以供应一头猪的精料。
    第三，充分利用水面培育水浮莲、水葫芦、革命草等高产水生饲料作物。吉安贸易公司养猪场，去年利用八亩水面培育水葫芦，得到了一千三百多头猪的全年青料。
    第四，大办饲料加工厂。凡是能够用作饲料的农副产品，如稻草、荞麦秆、花生壳、玉米心、油菜荚等，都可以加工。
    第五，改造草地、山坡，播种多年生的牧草，建立永久性的牧草基地，既可以轮牧，又可割取用来青贮。这是一项基本建设工作，集体养猪场应该作长远打算，积极着手进行。（附图片）
