Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 27th: Pingyi County, Shandong Province, the main producing area of honeysuckle, a commonly used Chinese medicinal material, has seen its honeysuckle grow with thick and lush branches this year. The dark green leaves are shiny, and the yellow-white flower buds are numerous, plump, and long. Some flower mounds have many flowers growing even from the roots. The first crop of flowers has already been picked, and the second crop is being picked. During the picking period, although it was continuously attacked by several strong wind and rainstorms, which caused some damage to the honeysuckle, the total output is still higher than last year.

Pingyi County attaches great importance to honeysuckle production. A deputy county head is in charge of this production. They have established a medicinal material production work group with thirty-eight professional cadres participating. Based on the county-run forest farm and the forestry teams of the commune-run forest farms, they have established one hundred and fifty specialized teams to strengthen the management of honeysuckle.

Honeysuckle is a special medicinal material of Shandong, and the output of Pingyi County alone accounts for more than half of the province's output. Honeysuckle has the effects of antipyretic, detoxification, sterilization, and diuresis in medical treatment.

    平邑银花丰产
    据新华社济南27日电　常用中药材银花的主要产地——山东平邑县，今年银花长得枝条粗壮茂密，墨绿色的叶子油光发亮，黄白色的花针又多又肥又长，有的花墩连根部都开了很多花。现在第一茬花已经采摘完毕，第二茬花正在采摘。在采摘期间，虽连续遭受几场大风雨的袭击，使银花受到一定损失，但是总产量仍比去年增加。
    平邑县对银花生产很重视，由一位副县长分工领导这项生产。他们成立了有三十八名专业干部参加的药材生产工作组，并以县营林场和社办林场的林业队为基础，建立了一百五十个专业队，加强了对银花的管理。
    银花是山东的特产药材，而平邑一县产量即占全省产量一半以上。银花在医疗上有解热、解毒、杀菌、利尿的作用。
