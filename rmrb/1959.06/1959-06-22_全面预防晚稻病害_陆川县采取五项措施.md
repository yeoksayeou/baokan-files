Comprehensive Prevention of Late Rice Diseases
Luchuan County Takes Five Measures

Nanning, June 21 (This newspaper's report) - Luchuan County, Guangxi, has been paying attention to the prevention and control of rice blast and brown spot disease of rice from the beginning of late rice sowing.

Some of the early rice in this county suffered from rice blast and brown spot disease in the later stage. These two diseases spread rapidly. As long as there are suitable conditions such as temperature and humidity, rice can be infected through seeds, stems, leaves, soil, and air.

When selecting late rice seeds, the county found that the seeds were generally parasitized by various germs, and the soil and straw must contain a lot of bacteria because the early rice had diseases. Based on this situation, Luchuan County adopted the following methods to vigorously prevent and control late rice diseases:

① Thoroughly disinfect the seeds by disinfecting them with broom branches medicine, warm water, and selecting seeds with salt water or lime water; ② When sowing, apply more than eighty catties of lime per mu of seedling field to kill the latent germs; ③ When raising seedlings, apply about five piculs of ash per mu; ④ Rice straw infected with rice blast in early rice should not be returned to the field, and must be burned; ⑤ Apply one hundred and fifty catties of lime in the paddy field.

Before soaking the seeds, each commune studied the disinfection work for disease prevention. After the Chengxiang Commune organized 120 people to visit the seed disinfection technology of the Wanzhang Brigade, each team established a seed selection station and a disinfection tank. All late rice seeds were selected and disinfected, and lime was generally applied to the seedling fields. The county has burned more than 83,000 dan of lime and accumulated more than 79,000 dan of fire ash, which has increased the material basis for disease prevention.

    全面预防晚稻病害
    陆川县采取五项措施
    本报南宁21日电　广西陆川县的晚稻，从播种开始，便注意了对稻热病和胡麻叶斑病的防治。
    这个县的部分早稻在后期发生了稻热病和胡麻叶斑病。这两种病害传播迅速，只要有一定的温度、湿度等适宜条件，通过种子、茎叶、土壤、空气就可以使水稻感染。
    这个县在晚稻选种时，发现种子普遍寄生各种病菌，土壤和禾秆因为早稻发生病害，含菌必然很多。根据这一情况，陆川县采用下列办法大力防治晚稻病害：
    ①种子进行彻底消毒，用扫把枝药液消毒，用温汤消毒，用盐水或石灰水选种；②在播种时，每亩秧田施石灰八十斤以上，把潜伏的各种病菌杀死；③育秧时，每亩施五担左右火灰；④早稻染有稻热病的禾秆不还田，一律烧掉；⑤在本田施石灰一百五十斤。
    各公社在浸种前都研究了防治病害的消毒工作。城厢公社组织一百二十人参观了万丈大队的种子消毒技术后，队队建立了选种站、消毒缸，全部晚稻种子都选种消毒，秧田普遍施了石灰。全县已烧制石灰八万三千多担，积火灰七万九千多担。为防治病害增加了物质基础。
