Dear Young Pioneers and Children!

The "June 1st" International Children's Day is approaching. As I extend my congratulations to you, images of countless lively, lovely, and physically fit children immediately appear before me, as if you are reporting your academic achievements to the motherland with clear and joyful voices. How excited I am! Because I know that in the past year, the achievements of our country's construction have been great, and your progress has also been rapid. Especially this year, more children have worn red scarves, and more children have participated in social welfare activities such as eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, planting, greening, and promoting Mandarin Chinese. In school, you have not only learned book knowledge and engaged in physical exercise, but also learned production knowledge and increased your ability to handle affairs from the small factories, small farms, and small pastures you run yourselves. You are more fond of labor than before, more united and friendly, and more able to help each other and cooperate. Thinking of these things, I am happy that you are growing up happily in this great Mao Zedong era, happy for your continuous progress! And proud of the infinitely beautiful future of our motherland!

When you are happily celebrating the festival, I want to remind you that you should not only enjoy happiness, but also prepare to create happiness for everyone in the future. You are children now, and when you grow up, you will inherit the great cause of socialism and build communism. Each generation must be stronger than the last, and each generation must be better than the last. Therefore, this year you must seize the opportunity, make full use of the current learning conditions, use your brains more, learn to distinguish right from wrong, good from evil, and be determined to take the path of socialism and communism. However, whether you are studying, working, or exercising, you must do it step by step, and you must not be impatient. From an early age, you must learn to arrange your time properly. Concentrate on reading when it is time to read; concentrate on working when it is time to work; play happily when it is time to play. You must also have enough sleep time and live a regular life. If you learn to manage your life from an early age, you will be able to manage the country when you grow up and truly become the masters of the country. The Party and the country earnestly hope that you will study hard, strive to learn cultural and scientific knowledge, pay attention to physical exercise, develop the habit of loving labor, the moral qualities of honesty, bravery, diligence and simplicity, and the highly communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. I think you will definitely work hard in this direction.

At the same time, when our children realize their happiness and feel happy, do not forget that today there are still many children in some countries who are living a miserable life in darkness under the wars, oppression, and exploitation created by imperialism. In those places, the clouds of war cover the children's laughter, and airplanes, atomic bombs, and military bases take away the children's bread, books, and toys, and even their young lives. Therefore, for the happiness of all the children in the world, and to defend the lives of the children, we must give deep sympathy to those children who are living a miserable life under the clutches of imperialism. We must unite with all peace-loving countries and people in the world to jointly oppose the imperialist war of aggression and defend lasting world peace. We firmly believe that peace will surely triumph. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is becoming stronger day by day, which is a reliable guarantee of peace.

Here, I sincerely congratulate the children of all ethnic groups across the country on growing up more happily and healthily under the care and nurturing of our beloved Party and country. I congratulate you on having a happy and meaningful festival - "June 1st" International Children's Day.

Finally, I wish you happiness! Joy! 1959.5.29

    向孩子们祝贺“六一”
    宋庆龄亲爱的少年儿童小朋友们！
    “六一”国际儿童节快到了。当我向你们表示祝贺的时候，眼前立刻出现了无数活泼可爱、体格健壮的儿童们的形象，仿佛你们用清脆而欢乐的声音，向祖国报告你们的学习成绩，我是多么的激动啊！因为我知道这一年来，祖国建设的成就很大，你们的进步也很快。特别是今年，有了更多的儿童带上了红领巾，更多的儿童参加了除四害、讲卫生、种植、绿化、和推广普通话等社会公益活动。你们在学校里，不但学会了书本知识，进行了体育锻炼，而且从你们自己办的小工厂、小农场、小牧场里学到了生产知识，增长了办事的本领。你们比以前更爱劳动了，更团结友爱了，更能互助合作了。想到这些，我为你们幸福地生长在这个伟大的毛泽东时代而高兴，为你们的不断进步而高兴！为我们祖国无限美好的未来而感到自豪！
    当你们欢乐地过节的时候，我想提醒你们，你们不但享受幸福，而且要准备将来为大家创造幸福。你们现在是少年儿童，将来长大成人，就要继承社会主义的宏伟事业，还要建设共产主义。一代要比一代强，一代要比一代好。因此，今年必须抓紧时机，充分运用现在的学习条件，多动脑筋，学会明辨是非善恶，立志走社会主义、共产主义的道路。但是，无论学习、劳动或锻炼身体，都要一步步地来，不能性急。从小要学会妥善地安排自己的时间。该读书的时候专心读书；该劳动的时候专心劳动；该玩的时候畅快地玩。还要有充足的睡眠时间，要过有规律的生活。如果从小就学会管理自己的生活，将来长大了就能管理国家，真正成为管理国家的主人。党和国家都热切地希望你们用功读书、努力学习文化和科学知识，注意锻炼身体，养成热爱劳动的习惯、诚实勇敢勤劳朴素的道德品质和敢想敢说敢干的高度的共产主义风格。我想，你们一定会朝这方面去努力的。
    同时，当我们的少年儿童认识到自己的幸福而感到快乐时，不要忘记，今天还有好些国家的孩子处在帝国主义所制造的战争和压迫剥削下，过着暗无天日的悲惨生活。在那些地方，战争的乌云遮盖了孩子们的欢笑，飞机、原子弹和军事基地夺去了孩子们的面包、书本和玩具，甚至幼小的生命。因此，为了世界上所有孩子们的幸福，为了保卫孩子们的生命，我们必须对于那些处在帝国主义魔掌下过着悲惨生活的孩子们，给以深切的同情。我们要和世界上所有爱好和平的国家和人民团结起来，共同反对帝国主义的侵略战争，保卫世界的持久和平。我们坚信和平必定胜利。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营一天比一天强大，这就是和平的可靠保证。
    在这里我衷心地祝贺全国各族少年儿童们在我们亲爱的党和国家的关怀和抚育下，更幸福更健康地成长起来。祝贺你们过一个快乐而有意义的节日——“六一”国际儿童节。
    最后，祝你们幸福！快乐！　　　　　　　　1959.5.29
