Our Lives Are Getting Better and Better

    Here is the Dongfeng People's Commune in Urumqi, a multi-ethnic people's commune in Xinjiang.

    "Our lives are getting better and better." This is the heartfelt feeling of members of all ethnic groups in the Dongfeng People's Commune since the establishment of the commune.

    Here, the grasslands are fertile and the cattle and sheep are plump. People are busy in the vast fields.

    The Dongfeng People's Commune was established more than half a year ago and consists of Han, Hui, Kazakh, Tatar, and other ethnic groups. They are engaged in animal husbandry and agricultural production. Some members only settled down recently. In addition to grasslands and farmland, there are also some mineral deposits and forestry, which can be widely used for diversified operations, which is conducive to both the development of agriculture and the settlement of herdsmen. Since the beginning of this year, the members have reclaimed more than 1,000 mu of wasteland, striving for a bumper harvest of both grain and feed.

    Right picture: In the past, herdsmen did not grow crops and sometimes had to slaughter some livestock as their staple food; now, the commune uniformly arranges agricultural and animal husbandry production. Since the beginning of this year, more than 1,000 mu of wasteland has been newly opened, striving for complete self-sufficiency in grain and feed. This is a scene of agricultural team members cultivating the land.

    我们的生活越过越好
    这里是新疆一个多民族的人民公社——乌鲁木齐市东风人民公社。
    “我们的生活越过越好。”这是东风人民公社各族社员在人民公社成立以来的亲切感受。
    这里，草原肥沃，牛羊膘肥。在大片的农田上，人们正在忙碌着。
    东风人民公社是在半年多以前成立的，有汉、回、哈萨克、塔塔尔等民族。他们从事着牧业和农业的生产。有一些社员还是不久以前才定居下来的。这里除了有草原、农田以外，还有一些矿藏和林业，能够广泛地进行多种经营，既有利于农业的发展，也有利于牧民的定居。今年以来，社员们已经开垦了一千多亩荒地，力争粮食、饲料都获得丰收。
