Use Your Brain and Work Hard: No Worries About Pigs' Food and Drink
　　Minle Production Team in Songjiang Opens Up Many Avenues, More Than Self-Sufficient in Pig Feed
　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Minle Production Team of Chengbei Commune, Songjiang County, Shanghai, vigorously uses green fodder to raise fat pigs, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient feed in the development of pig raising. Currently, the team has achieved self-sufficiency in pig feed.
　　Some cadres and people in this team initially had some concerns about raising pigs, mainly: fearing that there would not be enough feed, fearing that planting fodder fields would not yield much, fearing that making substitute feed would be troublesome, etc. The Party branch of the production team, based on the above ideological situation, held a meeting of all team deputy production cadres, explaining the benefits of raising pigs, and studying and formulating a "three guarantees" (guarantee output, guarantee cost, guarantee work), five fixings (fixing people, fixing quotas, fixing materials, fixing work points, fixing rewards and punishments) and a feeding management system. At the same time, a leading group was established by the Party branch secretary, the heads of each production team, and feeders and veterinarians, etc. Under the active leadership of the cadres, a wave of comprehensive development of public and private raising was quickly set off. The team currently has 1,292 pigs, and members privately raise 775 pigs.
　　In order to further overcome the difficulty of insufficient feed, the whole team formulated a feed production plan, opened up feed bases, vigorously carried out greening of water surfaces, mobilized the masses, and went to land, sea and air to demand feed. More than 80 laborers were drawn to replant more than 130 mu of wasteland and gaps, and adopted methods such as rotation, intercropping, and mixed planting to plant high-yield feeds such as pumpkins, cowpea, and sweet potatoes. And use car sheds, house edges, and trees to plant crops such as pumpkins and dragon claw beans, so that no inch of land is empty, no point of land is idle, and the car sheds and treetops are full of green. At the same time, a large number of water surfaces were afforested, planting water hyacinth, water hyacinth, water chestnut, and water amaranth, so that the two sides of the big river were green and the ponds were green.
　　Since last autumn, the team has launched a movement to turn coarse feed into fine feed, mobilizing the masses to ferment feed in every household, and basically all green and coarse feed is fermented before being fed to pigs. After fermentation, the fibers are softened, the quality is improved, the nutrition is increased, the pigs like to eat it, and they grow fast. Last year, team member Shen Fusheng raised three pigs. After six months of feeding, he only bought nine yuan worth of commercial feed. He mainly used fermented green substitute feed to feed the pigs, and all three pigs grew very well.
　　Thanks to the joint efforts of the members, the team has now opened up 130 mu of pig feed bases and planted various high-yielding, juicy feeds; expanded the use of 1,455 mu of water surface, transplanted water hyacinth, water amaranth, water hyacinth, water chestnut and other aquatic high-yield feeds, and at the same time, a large number of wild grasses and other substitute feeds are collected and used for silage, dry storage, and fermentation. The annual pig feed is not only self-sufficient, but also slightly surplus. (Attached picture)

    多动脑子勤动手　猪的吃喝不发愁
    松江民乐生产队广开门路，猪饲料自给有余
    本报讯　上海市松江县城北公社民乐生产队大力利用青饲料喂养肥猪，克服了生猪发展中的饲料不足困难，目前，这个队的猪饲料已做到自给自足。
    这个队的部分干部和群众起初对养猪有一些顾虑，主要是：怕饲料不足，怕种饲料田收获不多，怕搞代饲料麻烦，等等。生产队党支部根据以上思想情况，召开了全队副业生产干部会议，说明养猪的好处，研究制订了“三包”（包产、包本、包工）、五定（定人、定额、定料、定工分、定奖惩）和饲养管理制度。同时，由党支部书记、各生产小队负责人以及饲养员、兽医等建立了领导小组，在干部的积极带头下，很快掀起了公养私养全面发展的热潮。这个队现有生猪一千二百九十二头，社员私人养的有七百七十五头。
    为了进一步克服饲料不足的困难，全队制订饲料生产规划，开辟饲料基地，大搞水面绿化，发动群众，向水陆空进军要饲料。全队抽出八十多个劳动力，翻种荒田隙地一百三十余亩，采取轮种、套种、夹种等办法，种植南瓜、牛皮菜、山芋等高产饲料。并利用车棚、屋边、树旁种植南瓜、龙爪豆等作物，做到不空一寸土，不闲一分地，车棚、树头满顶绿。同时大量绿化水面，种植水浮莲、水葫芦、菱头、水苋菜，做到大河两边青，池塘一片绿。
    从去年秋季以来，这个队掀起了一个饲料粗变精运动，发动群众户户搞饲料发酵，基本上把青粗饲料全部发酵后喂猪。经过发酵，软化了纤维，提高质量，增加营养，猪喜欢吃，长肉快。社员沈福生去年养了三头猪，饲养六个月，只买了九元钱商品饲料，他主要是用青代饲料发酵后喂猪，三头猪都长得很好。
    由于社员们共同努力，目前全队已开辟了猪饲料基地一百三十多亩，播种了各种产量高鲜美多汁的饲料；扩大利用水面一千四百五十五亩，移植水浮莲、水苋菜、水葫芦、菱头等水生高产饲料，同时大量收集和利用野草等代饲料进行青贮、干藏、发酵，全年的猪饲料不但自给，并稍有多余。（附图片）
