    Struggle on the Ruins
    ——Watching the Film "On the Ruins of the Count's Estate"

    The Soviet domestic war of 1921 had ended, and the young republic entered a difficult period of economic recovery. At this time, although the Soviet regime was very consolidated, the hidden class enemies were still trying to take the opportunity to stir up trouble. In order to combat and eliminate the hidden bandits, the state security organs and the entire Soviet people (including children) worked together to carry out unremitting struggles against them. The Soviet film "On the Ruins of the Count's Estate" reflects this theme.
    The protagonist of the film, Terkach, is a street child who lost his parents in the war. He was deceived by the counter-revolutionary young count and the bandit Helyansh, who gave him the nickname "Little Hazel Grouse". Although Terkach is young, he is a clever child; he quickly sees through their criminal activities and manages to escape from danger.
    "Little Hazel Grouse" escapes alone to the ruins of a count's mansion, where he has no food or clothing. Fortunately, two children, Yasha and Varika, meet him by chance and become friends in adversity. However, by coincidence, the ruins are the old residence of the young count. The two vicious enemies, fearing arrest by the anti-revolutionary suppression personnel, also quietly return to the ruins of the old mansion, wanting to dig up a box of treasures buried by the old count and flee abroad. Thus, the struggle between the three children and the two hidden enemies unfolds on these ruins.
    Fearing that their plot to dig for treasure would be revealed, the two bandits tie up "Little Hazel Grouse," who they have captured for the second time, so that he cannot communicate with the anti-revolutionary suppression personnel. However, "Little Hazel Grouse," who understands the enemy's brutality, cleverly breaks free from his ropes and contacts his "comrades-in-arms" (Yasha and Varika) at a critical moment, asking them to report to the anti-revolutionary suppression personnel: "There are robbers here." Later, "Little Hazel Grouse" closes the door and does everything he can to prevent the bandits from stealing the treasure and escaping. The bandits use guns and arson, vicious means, to try to kill "Little Hazel Grouse," but "Little Hazel Grouse" demonstrates both determination and bravery in this life-and-death struggle. He believes that the state anti-revolutionary suppression staff—the defenders of the fruits of revolutionary victory—will surely come and suppress these two heinous enemies. Therefore, this little hero displays the tenacious spirit of fighting ten against one, and fighting a few against many, until the moment of victory. In the end, the young count is captured by the anti-revolutionary suppression personnel brought by the children, and the villain Helyansh also gets his due end.
    The film not only shows us the Soviet people's anti-espionage struggle to defend the country, but more importantly, through the struggle story, we see the growth of the new generation. When we first see the protagonist Terkach in the film, he is gazing enviously at the young soldiers singing on the train, his eyes revealing a yearning for freedom and happiness. The soldiers' songs penetrate the child's soul:
    "We fight side by side with our fathers and brothers,
    On the Don steppe,
    On the ice of Kronstadt.
    No matter what year it is,
    We should all be considered born in 1917."
    Life and struggle educate Terkach and his little comrades-in-arms, making them understand what to love, what to hate, and how to fight side by side with their fathers and brothers to defend their motherland. From Terkach and the other three children, we see the spiritual outlook of the new generation growing up under the Soviet system: honesty, wit, and courage. The film's portrayal of them is also delicate and moving.
    This film is adapted from Gaidar's novel of the same name. Gaidar is a famous Soviet children's literature writer. "On the Ruins of the Count's Estate" is one of his novellas, written in 1929. This novel is not the author's representative work. According to Gaidar's account in his autobiography, and as pointed out by some critics, it cannot be considered a fully mature work. However, we see that due to the efforts of the film adapters, directors, and young actors, this thrilling revolutionary story film is very moving. Therefore, the issue of creatively treating the original work in adaptation work is worth pondering by our playwrights and filmmakers.

    废墟上的搏斗
    ——看影片“在伯爵的废墟上”
    铁弦
    1921年苏联国内战争已经结束，年轻的共和国进入了艰苦的经济恢复时期。这时，苏维埃政权虽已十分巩固，但是暗藏的阶级敌人还在企图乘机蠢动。为了打击和消灭隐藏的匪徒，国家保安机关和苏联全国人民（也包括少年儿童）在一起，向他们进行过不懈的斗争。苏联影片“在伯爵的废墟上”就是反映这一主题的。
    影片的主人公捷尔卡奇是一个在战火中失掉双亲的流浪儿。他被反革命分子青年伯爵和匪徒赫良什骗去后，给了他一个绰号“小山鸡”。捷尔卡奇虽然年纪小，却是一个机警的孩子；很快他就识破了他们的罪恶勾当，设法逃出了虎口。
    “小山鸡”只身逃到一座伯爵邸宅的废墟中，他在这儿无衣无食，幸而有两个小朋友：亚沙和瓦里卡在偶然的机会中碰到了他，结成了患难之交。但是，事情凑巧得很，废墟就是青年伯爵的旧宅。那两个凶恶的敌人，因为害怕被肃反人员逮捕，也悄悄地回到旧宅院的废墟上来，想挖掘从前老伯爵埋藏的一箱珍宝，逃跑到国外去。于是三个孩子和两个暗藏的敌人之间的搏斗，就在这座废墟上展开了。
    两个匪徒生怕掘宝的阴谋被泄露，便把被他们第二次捉住了的“小山鸡”捆绑起来，使他无法再和肃反人员通消息。但是，识透了敌人残暴的“小山鸡”，机智地挣脱了绳索，在千钧一发的时机和他的“战友们”（亚沙和瓦里卡）取得了联系，让他们去报告肃反人员：“这里有强盗”。后来“小山鸡”又关紧了房门，全力来阻止匪徒们盗宝逃跑。匪徒们用枪击和放火的毒辣手段，想杀害“小山鸡”，然而，“小山鸡”在这场生死斗争中表现得既坚定又勇敢。他相信：国家肃反工作人员——革命胜利果实的捍卫者们一定会赶来，镇压这两个罪恶多端的敌人。因此，这个小英雄发挥了以一当十，以寡抵众的顽强精神，一直战斗到胜利的一刻。最后，青年伯爵终于被孩子们引来的肃反工作人员捉住，而那个恶棍赫良什也得到了应有的下场。
    影片不仅向我们展示了苏联人民保卫国家的反特斗争，更重要的是通过斗争故事，看到了新的一代的成长。我们在影片中第一次看到影片的主人公捷尔卡奇的时候，他正羡慕地凝视着列车上唱歌的青年战士，他的眼睛里流露着对自由、幸福的渴望。战士们的歌声渗透了孩子的心灵：
    “我们和父兄并肩作战，
    在顿河草原上，
    在喀琅施塔得的冰上。
    我们不论是在什么年月，
    我们都应该算是生在1917年。”
    生活和斗争教育了捷尔卡奇和他的小战友，使他们懂得了应该爱什么，恨什么，应该怎样去和父兄并肩作战，保卫自己的祖国。我们从捷尔卡奇等三个孩子身上，看到在苏维埃制度下成长的新的一代的精神面貌：诚实、机智、勇敢。影片对他们的描绘，也是细致而动人的。
    这部影片是根据盖达尔的同名小说改编的。盖达尔是苏联著名的儿童读物作家。“在伯爵的废墟上”是他的一部中篇小说，写成于1929年。这部小说并不是作者的代表作，根据盖达尔在自传中的记述，和某些评论家所指出，它不能算做是一部十分成熟的作品。但是，我们看到，由于电影改编者、导演和小演员们的努力，这部惊险的革命故事影片却很动人。所以，在改编工作中，创造性地对待原著这一问题，是值得我们的剧作家和电影工作者们深思的。
