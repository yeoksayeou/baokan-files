The winding peaks stretch for thousands of miles, shrouded in mist and snow for half the year. This is a portrayal of the mountainous area of Fengjie County, Sichuan Province. On that high mountain, 2,300 meters above sea level, even in the sunny March, snow still flutters; in the scorching July heat, hail as large as pebbles can suddenly fall; and fierce tigers and leopards can pounce head-on through the dense fog. It is in this place that a Ping'an Women's Store was established. They are small in number, only seven people, but their working spirit is like a pine tree standing on the top of the mountain, upright and unyielding. What is particularly worth mentioning here is the female Communist Youth League member and manager – Comrade Huang Wenhua. Over the past few years, Huang Wenhua and all the staff have traveled every corner of this area, undaunted by difficulties and tireless, supplying the mountain farmers with various agricultural tools and general merchandise, purchasing local specialties and medicinal materials, and assisting the commune in setting up factories and workshops, and opening restaurants and sewing shops. The farmers affectionately call her "Clever Girl."

Perhaps some people think that Huang Wenhua is a commercial worker with many years of experience. No, three years ago, she was still a sixteen-year-old girl, fresh out of school. With a burst of enthusiasm, she came to this large mountainous area. At that time, she asked herself, "Can't miracles be created here?"

The day after she arrived, the organization assigned her to accounting work. Stacks of account books and forms, densely packed with numbers, made her dizzy. However, Huang Wenhua is a person who is unwilling to lag behind. With the help of the Party branch of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperative, and after diligent study, she basically mastered accounting business in just half a year. Then, she learned the business of a salesperson.

In October last year, due to the rapid economic development of the mountainous area, the organization transferred Huang Wenhua to Ping'an branch store, the most remote in the county, to serve as manager. At this time, the people in the mountainous area were fighting for steel. The original male shop assistants were all transferred out, and the newcomers were six women, averaging less than twenty years old, and all were novices, but the workload was increasing day by day. The greatest pressure on them at this time was the gunpowder needed for mining. The gunpowder originally sold by the branch store was only a few pounds or dozens of pounds for hunting wild animals. Now, for mining, it was required in thousands of pounds. Stocks were limited, it was impossible to transfer goods, and it was urgent to use them. What to do? Should she ask the higher-ups for help, or find a solution herself? In those days, she visited experienced people in the surrounding villages every day. One day, she found Old Man Yang, an eighty-three-year-old from Qinglong Commune. The old man told her that there were many caves here, rich in mirabilite, could it be used to make gunpowder! She found this way, overjoyed, and led four workers to explore each cave over mountains and ridges. Every few steps, she would pinch a little soil and put it in her mouth to taste. Anything that tasted bitter and astringent, she determined that it contained abundant mirabilite. As a result, she found more than ninety caves, half of which produced saltpeter.

With saltpeter, there was also alkali. After testing, gunpowder was finally made. In just over two months, it provided more than 82,000 catties of gunpowder to the steel front. From then on, people said happily, Huang Wenhua is our "Gunpowder King" of Fengjie County!

Compared to big cities, commercial work in remote mountainous areas has its special difficulties. However, Huang Wenhua firmly believes that as long as there is the leadership of the Party, all difficulties can be overcome. In March of this year, there were howling winds and heavy snowfall. At that time, the tung seeds on the mountain had already fallen to the ground. If we waited for the spring snow to melt, the germinated tung seeds would reduce the oil yield. In order to avoid this loss, Huang Wenhua led the staff, braving the wind and snow, and rushed thirty miles in one breath to find Yi Shou Kang, the Party branch secretary of Shuangdian Commune, asking him to mobilize the masses to pick up tung seeds and sell them to the state. With the support of the commune Party committee, taking advantage of the fact that there was not much farm work due to the snowfall, a group of laborers was drawn to pick tung seeds. As a result, in just two days, more than 230,000 catties of tung seeds were purchased, exceeding the original plan by one time.

Working here requires every salesperson to be familiar with the industry. Once, purchasing agent Shao Qianzhen, because he was not clear about the price of a certain medicinal material, gave less money for the medicinal material during the purchase. Everyone was very sad about this, believing that it was mainly because everyone was not familiar with the business. For this reason, Huang Wenhua organized all the employees of the branch store to launch a "one proficiency, one hundred understanding" learning movement. Every morning, Huang Wenhua and the staff were together, identifying and studying the commodity catalog issued by the higher authorities one by one against the samples, teaching and learning from each other. She knew that this was related to the interests of the country and the masses. Now, she is able to take on the most complex procurement work of medicinal materials and fur, and, since then, no mistakes have occurred again.

With the support of the local commune Party committee, Huang Wenhua established a sewing shop and a wild game restaurant. When the first sewing machine was shipped to Ping'an branch store, not only the women, but even many men came. Because this was the first machine in the mountainous area. They believed that as long as there was this beginning, the good days of the mountain people would not be far away. (Attached picture)

    高山上的女经理
    本报记者　范眭
    逶迤群峰数千里，迷蒙雾雪占半年。这是四川省奉节县山区的写照。在那海拔二千三百公尺的高山上，虽是阳春三月，依然大雪纷飞；七月盛暑，卵石般大的冰雹，会骤然而降；而凶猛的虎豹则会乘着迷漫大雾迎面扑来。就在这块地方，却设置了一个平安女子商店。她们的人数不多，只有七人，而她的工作精神就像矗立在山巅上的松树一样，挺立不拔。这里值得特别介绍的是女共青团员、经理——黄文华同志。几年来，黄文华和全体职工，不畏艰难，不知疲倦地走遍了这里的每一个角落，供应山区农民各种农具、百货，收购当地盛产的各种土特产、药材，协助公社兴办工厂、作坊，开设餐馆、缝纫店。农民们都亲昵地叫她“巧姑娘”。
    也许有人以为黄文华是一个具有多年经验的商业工作者。不，三年以前，她还是一个十六岁的小姑娘，刚刚走出学校门。她凭着一股子热情，来到了这个大山区，当时，她就问了一下自己：“难道在这里就不能创造奇迹吗？”
    刚到的第二天，组织上分配她作会计工作。一叠叠的账册、簿表，密密麻麻的数字，把她看得眼花缭乱。但是，黄文华是一个不甘落后的人，在基层供销社的党支部帮助下，经过勤学苦钻，短短半年时间，便基本上掌握了会计业务。接着，她又学会了营业员的业务。
  去年10月，由于山区经济的迅速发展，组织上把黄文华调到全县最偏僻的平安分销店担任经理职务。这时，山区的人民正在为钢而战，这里，原来的男营业员都抽调出去了，新来的是六个妇女，平均年龄不到二十岁，又都是新手，而工作量却一天天在加大。这时给她们压力最大的是采矿需要的火药。分销店原来经营的火药，只是供打野兽用的几斤几十斤，现在采矿，一要就是几千斤。存货有限，调货调不到，又急等着用。怎么办呢？伸手向上面要呢，还是自己想办法解决？那几天，她天天到四乡里去访问有经验的人。一天她找到青龙公社八十三岁的杨老大爷，老汉对她说这里有不少山洞，里面盛产芒硝，能不能用来制火药哩！她找到了这条门路，欣喜若狂，就带领四个工人，翻山越岭，探索着每个岩洞。她每走几步，就撮一点泥土送到嘴里尝尝，凡是尝到带苦、涩味道的，断定这里面含有丰富的芒硝。结果给她找到了九十几个山洞，其中有一半产硝。
    硝有了，碱也有了。经过试验，终于制成了火药。在短短两个多月中，给钢铁前线提供了八万二千多斤火药。从此，人们都高兴地说，黄文华是我们奉节县的“火药大王”！
    比起大城市来，边远山区的商业工作有它特殊的困难。但是，黄文华坚信，只要有党的领导，一切困难都是可以克服的。今年3月，这里狂风怒号，大雪纷飞。当时山上的桐子已经落地，如果等春雪溶化，桐子发了芽就会降低出油率。为了避免这一损失，黄文华带领职工，迎风冒雪，一口气赶了三十里路，找到了双店公社党支部书记易寿康，请他动员群众拣拾桐子，卖给国家。在公社党委的支持下，趁下雪农活不多，抽出了一批劳力去拣桐子。结果，在短短的两天内，就收购了二十三万多斤桐子，超过了原订计划的一倍。
    在这里工作，要求每个营业人员都能熟悉本行业，一次，采购员邵乾珍，因为对一种药材的价格不清楚。在收购时，把药材的价钱给少了。为了这件事，大家都很难过，认为这主要是大家对业务不熟悉的缘故。为此，黄文华组织全分销店职工展开了一个“一精百通”的学习运动。每天一早，黄文华和职工们在一起，把上级发下来的商品目录，对照样品逐一辨别研究，互教互学。她知道这里面关系着国家和群众的利益。现在，她已能担任最复杂的药材、毛皮采购工作，并且，自此以后，再也没有发生过差错。
    黄文华在当地公社党委的支持下，兴办了缝纫店和野味餐馆。当第一部缝纫机运抵平安分销店时，不仅妇女们，甚至许多男人也都赶来了。因为，这是山区的第一部机器。他们相信，只要有了这个开端，山人民的美好日子就不远了。（附图片）
