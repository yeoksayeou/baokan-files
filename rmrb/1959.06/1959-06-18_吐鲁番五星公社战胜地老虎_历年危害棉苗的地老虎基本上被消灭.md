　　Our newspaper Turpan, 17th – The Five-Star Commune in Turpan County, Xinjiang, adopted effective measures to defeat the cutworm, a pest that has seriously harmed cotton seedlings over the years, ensuring full seedling emergence and normal growth on more than 30,000 mu of cotton fields throughout the commune.

　　The battle cry put forward by the commune's Party committee was: "Prevent first, then treat, and strive to eliminate cutworms in their larval stage." The methods they adopted were comprehensive technical measures such as removing eggs and weeding, sugar syrup to attract moths, and spraying medicinal powder, mobilizing the masses for a comprehensive encirclement and suppression. Members of each production team used sugar, peach gum, rotten raisins, and elm leaves to boil a slurry to attract and kill moths. Within five days, a total of more than 440,000 moths were attracted and killed, equivalent to capturing more than 160 million cutworms, basically eliminating the cutworms in their early stages.

　　After this prevention and control effort, the more than 30,000 mu of cotton in the commune generally grew vigorously, with cotton seedlings reaching more than ten centimeters in height. (Han Wenhui)

    吐鲁番五星公社战胜地老虎
    历年危害棉苗的地老虎基本上被消灭
    本报吐鲁番17日电  新疆吐鲁番县五星公社采取有效措施，战胜了历年来严重为害棉苗的害虫——地老虎，保证了全社三万余亩棉田全苗和正常生长。
    这个公社的党委提出的战斗口号是：“先防后治，力争把地老虎消灭在幼虫阶段。”他们采取的方法是，铲卵除草、糖浆诱蛾、喷洒药粉的综合技术措施，发动群众全面围剿。各生产队的社员用糖、桃胶、烂葡萄干和榆树叶煮成浆汁诱蛾捕杀，五天内共诱蛾四十四万多只，等于捕获一亿六千多条地老虎，基本上把地老虎消灭在初生阶段。
    经过这次防治，全社三万多亩棉花普遍生长旺盛，棉苗高达十公分以上。  （韩文慧）
