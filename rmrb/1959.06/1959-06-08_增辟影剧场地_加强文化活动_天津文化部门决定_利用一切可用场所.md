Expanding Cinema and Theater Venues
    Strengthening Cultural Activities
    Tianjin Cultural Department Decides
    To Utilize All Available Locations
    On the afternoon of June 5th, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture convened a meeting of responsible persons from cinema and theater units throughout the city, as well as from district trade unions, cultural centers, and clubs, to discuss further strengthening film and theater activities. The consensus was that it is necessary to utilize all available venues and equipment throughout the city to expand film screenings and theatrical performances, in order to meet the cultural needs of the masses.

    With the development of production, the masses' demands for cultural life are also increasing. Since the beginning of this year, the number of film and theater audiences in the city has surged, with the average attendance rate at cinemas and theaters increasing by more than 26% compared to the same period last year. On holidays and festivals, cinemas and theaters throughout the city are often fully booked.

    In order to meet the needs of the masses, relevant parties have, after research and consultation, decided to open a number of new venues for film and theater activities. In addition to opening cinemas and theaters in cultural centers and clubs, film and theater units are also preparing to cooperate with some government agencies, factories, and schools to conduct film and theater activities in the auditoriums of these units, without affecting their use. In order to meet the needs of the masses to escape the summer heat, it was also proposed to select some suitable squares to add open-air cinemas. Some locations have been preliminarily selected at the meeting, and it is hoped that the relevant units will actively prepare new cinemas and theaters at these locations, striving to receive audiences in the shortest possible time.

    In order to ensure that the newly opened cinemas and theaters have films to show and troupes to perform, the film and theater units have also worked out some specific measures. The Municipal Film Distribution Company has decided to immediately begin compiling and re-screening excellent films that have been shown and loved by the masses in recent years, while striving to expand the distribution of new films. In terms of drama, in addition to performances by professional drama groups in the city, the Municipal Bureau of Culture is also preparing to invite some troupes from other places to perform in Tianjin. Some groups that have not often performed commercially in the past, such as opera schools and youth training teams of various professional troupes, will also appropriately increase the number of public performances, so that audiences can see more plays and young opera students and actors can increase their opportunities for stage practice.

    增辟影剧场地
    加强文化活动
    天津文化部门决定
    利用一切可用场所
    天津市文化局5日下午召集全市影剧事业单位和各区工会、文化馆、俱乐部负责人，研究进一步加强电影戏剧活动。大家认为，需要将全市可能利用的场地、设备利用起来，扩大电影放映和戏剧演出活动，以适应群众文化生活的需要。
    随着生产的发展，群众对文化生活的要求也越来越多。今年以来，全市电影、戏剧观众激增，影剧场的上座率，比去年同期平均提高了26％以上。每逢假日和节日，全市影剧场常常客满。
    为了适应群众的需要，各有关方面经过研究协商，决定开辟一批新的影剧活动场所。除了在文化馆、俱乐部开设影剧场以外，影剧事业单位还准备和部分机关、工厂、学校合作，在不影响各单位使用的情况下，利用这些单位的礼堂开展一些影剧活动。为了适应群众消夏的需要，大家还提出要选择一些适用的广场，增辟露天电影。会上初步选定了一些地点，希望各有关单位在这些地点积极筹办新影剧场，争取最短时间内接待观众。
    为了让新开辟的影剧场所，有影片上映，有剧团演出，各影剧事业单位也研究出了一些具体办法。市电影发行公司决定在争取扩大新片发行业务的同时，立即着手将几年来放映过的群众喜爱的优秀影片整理出来，重新放映。戏剧方面，除了由市内专业戏剧团体演出以外，市文化局还准备到外地去邀请一些剧团，来天津演出。一些过去不常作营业演出的团体，如戏曲学校、各专业剧团的少年训练队，也将适当增加公演次数，一方面让观众能够多看一些戏，一方面可以让青年戏曲学员和演员增加舞台实践的机会。
