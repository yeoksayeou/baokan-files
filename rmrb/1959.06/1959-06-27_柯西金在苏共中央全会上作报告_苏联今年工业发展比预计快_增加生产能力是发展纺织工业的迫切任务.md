Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 26th: According to TASS, Kosygin, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Vice- председатель [Predsedatel’] of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Chairman of the State Planning Committee of the Soviet Union, delivered a report at the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on the 25th regarding measures for further developing the textile industry.

	Kosygin said that in recent years, our Party has discussed a series of major national economic issues and made many historically significant resolutions on these issues. Further development of the textile industry is an integral part of the truly magnificent creative work being carried out by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party in implementing the Seven-Year Plan.

	The reporter said that our economy is now in a new period of vigorous growth. The industry of various Union Republics and National Economic Councils are victoriously implementing the established plans. In the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the rate of industrial development is faster than planned. Compared with the first half of last year, the total industrial output from January to June this year increased by 11%, while this year's task only stipulated an increase of 7.7%.

	The rapid development of heavy industry and the rapid upsurge of agriculture have created conditions for industries producing consumer goods to obtain raw materials, equipment, fuel, power, and materials.

	Kosygin pointed out that in solving the task of increasing the production of consumer goods, the textile industry plays a significant role. Textile industry products account for approximately one-tenth of the total industrial products in the country. In more than two thousand various textile enterprises, there are one million three hundred thousand workers, engineering technicians, and staff. In 1958, textile production nearly reached 7.5 billion meters, which is 70% higher than the 1940 level. Now, our textile production is more than any country in the world except for the United States.

	When discussing the most important issues of further developing the textile industry, Kosygin pointed out that the first issue is about production capacity. Production capacity has greatly increased in recent years. At the same time, compared with the UK and the US, our industry has reached a higher degree of equipment load. For example, compared with the UK, our number of spindles and textile machines are 58.3% and 33.3% less, respectively, but we produce twice as many textiles as the UK. The United States produces 50% more textiles than us, but it has twice as many spindles and 70% more textile machines than us, respectively. The large increase in the production of our textile industry has been achieved through the establishment of multi-shift systems, acceleration of equipment operation, technical re-equipment of a series of old factories, and construction of new enterprises.

	The reporter emphasized that now, the production of agricultural raw materials and chemical raw materials needed by the textile industry is increasing sharply, and it must be ensured that all these raw materials are processed with good quality. However, the existing production capacity of the textile industry is still not enough, and its growth is lagging behind the needs. Therefore, in order to ensure the further development of the textile industry, the most urgent task is to increase production capacity. During the Seven-Year Plan, 7.5 million spindles and 155,000 textile machines should be put into production, which is more than three times and more than twice as many spindles and textile machines put into production in the past seven years, respectively. For this purpose, 26 billion rubles will be invested.

	A large part of the report is about equipping the textile industry with new technologies. Kosygin pointed out that much work has been done in this regard recently. In cotton textile production, the proportion of modern textile machines has increased to 84%, and the proportion of automatic looms has increased to 53%. Within seven years, we should replace almost all low-capacity textile machines with new and modern textile machines, and increase the proportion of automatic looms to 75%.

	The reporter pointed out that the production of textile machines lags behind the growing needs both in quantity and quality. In order to eliminate the backwardness and strengthen the base of the textile industry, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates the renovation and expansion of the existing thirty-seven factories and the construction of six new factories.

	The reporter further emphasized that measures must be formulated to organize the centralized manufacturing of mechanized and automated tools for the textile industry in machine manufacturing plants; complete sets of new equipment with all automation tools must be produced. The reporter pointed out that the most important potential in increasing textile production is to vigorously promote the experience of advanced enterprises.

	In concluding his report, Kosygin said that the discussion of the work of the textile industry at the Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee with the participation of leading cadres of the Party, the Soviets, and economic departments of various republics and national economic councils is once again proof that our Party unreservedly cares for the people, cares for the vital interests of the people, and considers this to be its most important and primary work.

    柯西金在苏共中央全会上作报告
    苏联今年工业发展比预计快
    增加生产能力是发展纺织工业的迫切任务
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团候补委员、苏联部长会议副主席、苏联国家计划委员会主席柯西金25日在苏共中央全会上作了关于进一步发展纺织工业的措施的报告。
    柯西金说，最近几年来，我们党讨论了一系列重大的国民经济问题，并且就这些问题作出了许多具有历史意义的决议。进一步发展纺织工业是苏联人民在共产党领导下执行七年计划时所进行的真正宏伟的创造性工作中的一个组成部分。
    报告人说，我国的经济现在正处在新的蓬勃高涨中。各加盟共和国和国民经济委员会的工业正在胜利地执行规定的计划。在七年计划的头一年中，工业的发展速度比计划规定的更快。同去年上半年相比，今年1月到6月工业总产量增长11％，而今年的任务只规定增长7.7％。
    重工业的飞速发展和农业的急剧高涨为生产消费品的工业提供原料、设备、燃料、动力和材料创造了条件。
    柯西金指出，在解决消费品的增产任务中，纺织工业起着重大的作用。纺织工业产品大约占全国工业总产品的十分之一。在两千多个各种纺织企业中，有一百三十万名工人、工程技术人员和职员。1958年纺织品产量差不多达到七十五亿公尺，比1940年的水平高70％。现在我们的纺织品生产，除美国外，比世界上任何国家都要多。
    在谈到进一步发展纺织工业的最重要的问题时，柯西金指出，第一个问题是关于生产能力的问题。生产能力在最近几年来大大提高了。同时，我们的工业同英美两国比较，达到了更高的装备负荷程度。例如，同英国相比，我们的纱锭数量和纺织机数量分别比它少58.3％和33.3％，但是，我们生产的纺织品却比英国多两倍。美国生产的纺织品比我们多50％，但是它的纱锭和纺织机却分别比我们多一倍和70％。我们纺织工业生产的大量增长是通过建立多班制、加速设备的运转、对一系列旧工厂进行技术重新装备和建设新企业来达到的。
    报告人强调指出，现在，纺织工业所需的农业原料和化学原料的生产正在急剧增加，必须保证将这些原料全部进行质量良好的加工。但是，纺织工业现有的生产能力还不够，而其增长也落后于需要。因此为了保证进一步发展纺织业，最迫切的任务是增加生产能力。在七年计划期间应当有七百五十万纱锭和十五万五千台纺织机投入生产，这比过去七年投入生产的纱锭和纺织机分别多三倍多和两倍多。为此目的将投资二百六十亿卢布。
    报告的很大部分是关于用新技术装备纺织工业的问题。柯西金指出，最近在这方面做了不少工作。在棉纺织生产中现代化的纺织机的比重增加到了84％，自动织布机增加到了53％。在七年之内，我们应当用新的和现代化的纺织机来代替差不多所有生产能力低的纺织机器，并且把自动织布机的比重增加到75％。
    报告人指出，纺织机器的生产，不论是在数量上和质量上都落后于日益增长的需要。为了消除落后现象和加强纺织工业的基地，七年计划规定要改建和扩建现有的三十七家工厂，建设六家新工厂。
    报告人进一步着重指出，必须拟订措施，以便在机器制造厂中组织集中制造纺织工业用的机械化和自动化工具；必须生产带有一切自动化工具的成套新式装备。报告人指出，在增加纺织品产量方面的最重要的潜力是大力推广先进企业的经验。
    柯西金在结束报告时说，在有各共和国和各国民经济委员会的党的、苏维埃的、以及经济部门的领导干部参加的党中央全会上讨论纺织工业工作的问题，这再一次证明，我们党不卷地关怀人民，关怀人民的切身利益，并且认为这是自己最重要和最主要的工作。
