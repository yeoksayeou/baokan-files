Comprehensive report from our newspaper: From April 16th to June 8th, the Soviet Bolshoi Theatre Ballet toured four American cities—New York, Washington, Los Angeles, and San Francisco—for a total of 52 days. After concluding their American tour on the 8th, the troupe flew to Canada on June 9th, where they will continue their visit and performances.

The tour of the Soviet Bolshoi Theatre Ballet in the United States was conducted under the terms of the Soviet-American cultural agreement signed last year.

During their tour in the United States, the troupe performed 52 times, featuring the ballets "Romeo and Juliet," "Swan Lake," "Giselle," and "The Stone Flower." A total of 300,000 audience members enjoyed the troupe's brilliant performances.

During the performances, every show was not only completely sold out, but many audience members also stood in the aisles to watch. Many people who couldn't even buy tickets even wrote letters to Canada, where the troupe was scheduled to visit next, to reserve tickets. Every performance by the troupe was warmly welcomed by the audience. Each time a performance ended, the curtain calls often lasted dozens of times, and the flowers and baskets of flowers presented to the performers almost buried them. The audience was reluctant to leave the theater for a long time, applauding and cheering continuously. Enthusiastic and excited audience members lined up to see the performers off to their cars, eagerly shaking their hands and patting them on the shoulders. Praises like "Wonderful!" and "Excellent!" were endless.

During the performances, American newspapers and magazines published dozens of articles commenting on the troupe's performances, giving them high praise. Drew Pearson's commentary, published in the "Washington Post and Times Herald," enthusiastically praised the superb art of the Soviet ballet troupe. He also believed that this would "help the Russian people and the American people understand each other." He said, "Because Americans who applaud and cheer for the elegant and symmetrical performances of the Bolshoi Theatre Ballet are beginning to understand that this is performed by resolute and cultured people."

    精湛的艺术　优美的表演
    苏芭蕾舞在美演出获得成功
    美国报刊认为有助于苏美两国人民互相了解
    本报综合报道　苏联大剧院芭蕾舞蹈团从4月16日到6月8日先后在美国的纽约、华盛顿、洛杉矶和旧金山等四个城市作了为时五十二天的巡回演出。舞蹈团在8日结束了在美国的巡回演出后，已于6月9日乘飞机赴加拿大，并将在那里继续访问演出。
    苏联大剧院芭蕾舞蹈团是根据去年苏美两国签订的苏美文化协定到美国进行巡回演出的。
    舞蹈团在美国巡回演出期间，共演出五十二场，剧目有：“罗密欧与朱丽叶”、“天鹅湖”、“吉赛尔”和“宝石花”，共有三十万观众欣赏了舞蹈团的精采演出。
    在演出期间，舞蹈团的每次演出，不仅场场满座，而且还有许多观众站在旁边的过道上观看，有许多连票都买不到的人，甚至写信到舞蹈团以后将要访问的加拿大去订票。舞蹈团的每一场演出都受到观众的热烈欢迎。每当节目演完时，谢幕往往达数十次之多，观众赠送给演员们的鲜花和花篮，几乎把演员们都埋起来了。观众们久久不肯离开剧场，不停的鼓掌和喝采，热情、激动的观众们排成行列，一直把演员们欢送上汽车，并且争着和他们握手，亲切地拍他们的肩膀，“真精彩”、“妙极了”等的赞扬之声不绝于耳。
    在演出期间，美国报刊和杂志先后发表了几十篇评论舞蹈团演出的文章，对舞蹈团给了很高的评价。“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”发表的德鲁·皮尔逊的评论，热烈地赞扬了苏联芭蕾舞蹈团的高超的艺术，他并且认为，这样会“帮助俄国人民和美国人民彼此了解”，他说，“因为对大剧院芭蕾舞蹈团的高雅和对称的演出鼓掌喝采的美国人开始懂得，这是由有决心的有文化修养的人民演出的”。
