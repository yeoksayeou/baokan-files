    Seriously Study Theory
    Li Shu
    In the past forty years, our Party has achieved great success in solving Chinese problems by applying Marxism. The symbol of this success is Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the Chinese revolution, and the development of socialist construction. However, it must also be admitted that we still lack a sufficiently strong contingent of Marxist theoretical workers. To form a theoretical work force, tens of thousands of people must study Marxism, everyone must possess rich theoretical knowledge, and be good at using Marxism to solve China's practical problems. Otherwise, it will not become a team.
    For this purpose, we must read books. How to read books? Is it necessary to thoroughly study the works of Marxist classical writers? It is necessary. We certainly oppose learning by rote memorization, but we cannot therefore say that we do not need to read the books carefully and thoroughly. Being able to read them thoroughly is always beneficial. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Regarding Marxist theory, we must be able to be proficient in it and apply it; the purpose of proficiency is entirely for application." These words are very important. Proficiency means reading a lot, reading thoroughly, and being able to comprehend. This is a condition for applying Marxism. Without this condition, if one fundamentally does not know or knows very little about what the Marxist classical writers have said about the problems we want to solve, then there is no way to talk about applying Marxism. Of course, we must maintain our Party's fine tradition of creatively studying Marxist theory, that is, the tradition of linking theory with practice, not treating theory as dogma, but regarding it as a guide to action. We should strive to achieve what Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To be able to correctly interpret the actual problems that occur in history and in the revolution based on the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, and to be able to give scientific explanations and theoretical explanations on various issues in China's economy, politics, military affairs, and culture." Of course, linking theory with practice must never be a far-fetched interpretation of theory. A far-fetched interpretation is not linking theory with practice, but a vulgarization and dogmatization of theory, which we must resolutely oppose.
    If we want to become true Marxists, Marxists who are sufficient to contribute to the socialist construction of our era, we cannot only read Marxist classics without reading other ancient and contemporary works. Marxist classical works are the crystallization of all the knowledge accumulated by mankind in the past, which no one can deny. But we must never think that with the classical works, with the crystallization of all the knowledge accumulated by mankind in the past, everything is satisfactory and we can throw away all the knowledge accumulated by mankind in the past. All the knowledge accumulated by mankind in the past is a great treasure. In mankind's understanding of the laws of society and nature, there are many issues that predecessors have repeatedly considered, and we now need to continue to consider. Then, the achievements of the predecessors on these issues are treasures for us. If we do not use the achievements of our predecessors, and do not know the detours they have taken in those places, there will be two possibilities: either falling into the rut of our predecessors, or being inferior to our predecessors. On the one hand, we must strive to study the current issues, and on the other hand, we must also look for the ideological materials of our predecessors in order to solve the current problems, and develop the treasures of our predecessors. Marxist classical writers have already opened up the road to explore this treasure, provided the keys to development, and developed many important parts of it. We should continue to develop along their road and with the keys they provide. Lenin pointed out, "Only by accurately understanding the culture created by the entire development process of mankind, only by transforming this culture, can we build the culture of the proletariat. Without such an understanding, we cannot complete this task." He also said, "Only by enriching our minds with all the knowledge wealth created by mankind can we become communists." Of course, not all of the treasures hidden in the treasure trove of human knowledge are gems. There is also a large amount of mud and sand, toxins left over from slave society, feudal society, and capitalist society. Therefore, developing this treasure is like the story of developing a treasure in "One Thousand and One Nights", a dangerous thing. But we have Marxism as a weapon, so we can not be afraid of danger, we can distinguish what is a treasure and what is mud and sand, and be good at removing the mud and sand and taking the treasure.
    We know that all Marxist classical writers are very knowledgeable figures. Comrade Mao Zedong is the most knowledgeable person in China in our era. We should learn from them and make ourselves learned Marxists. The famous British philosopher Bacon has a famous saying, "Knowledge is power." This is correct. In the past, the reactionary class implemented a policy of deceiving the people, which can be said to be precisely to make the working people have no power, so as to facilitate their rule. According to Marx and Engels' analysis, the awakening of the modern proletariat is also related to the transfer of knowledge elements from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Since the proletariat and the working people of our country have basically eliminated the exploiting classes and become the masters of the country, they should naturally strive to become the masters of knowledge in an all-round way, arm themselves with rich knowledge, and fully realize and give play to the ideals of mankind. Comrade Mao Zedong told the leading comrades at all levels of our Party that in order to do a good job entrusted by the Party, they must have knowledge in many fields, must learn some natural science and technology, learn some philosophy and political economy, learn some history and law, learn some literature, learn some grammar and logic, and leading comrades at the central and provincial and municipal levels should also strive to learn a foreign language. The leading comrades at all levels of our Party are very busy. They have to handle many things every day, but Comrade Mao Zedong believes that no matter how busy they are, they still have to learn so much knowledge of disciplines. As for our young comrades, our scientific workers, and our students who are in school, they should learn more. Of course, this does not mean that a person should learn everything. It is not possible to learn everything. Many people can become all-rounders, but according to the general situation, they should take Marxist theory as the guide, learn one discipline well, and also learn other disciplines. For example, natural scientists should not only be proficient in the discipline they specialize in, but also learn other related disciplines, and should also have rich philosophical knowledge; philosophers should not only strive to be proficient in all philosophical thoughts, but also have rich natural science knowledge; historians need more knowledge than natural scientists and philosophers. And all these people should learn foreign languages, at least one, preferably several.
    It is certainly hard to learn so much knowledge. However, revolutionaries should not be afraid of hardship. Of course, the so-called hard work does not mean harming health, but means not missing the time under normal conditions and breaking through the difficulties in learning. We should become diligent people who cherish time, and make use of time as much as possible for learning, in addition to participating in general practical activities. Students can surpass teachers, and people today can surpass predecessors, but the key lies in serious study. If you don't study, if studying is not hard, then not to mention surpassing teachers and surpassing predecessors, even the level you have already reached will not be surpassed.
    I heard that now some people are afraid of making dogmatic mistakes and dare not talk about systematic learning. They say that if you talk about theory and systems, it will become dogma, or be accused of dogmatism. This kind of thinking is wrong. Theory becomes dogma, not because it has a system itself or the person who speaks it speaks it systematically, but because dogmatists understand it as dogma. We oppose dogmatism, but it does not contain any meaning of opposing reading, opposing systematic learning, or systematically teaching theory. It should not be thought that reading is dogmatism. If the way of thinking is wrong, you will make dogmatic mistakes even if you don't read. In our country's revolutionary struggle, some comrades made dogmatic mistakes. Was it because they read too much? No. They did not read too much, but read too little, accepted too little knowledge from their predecessors, and unilaterally understood the little bit of theoretical knowledge they obtained. Therefore, the method of correcting dogmatism should not only require the unity of theory and practice first, strengthen exercise in practical work, but also pay attention to reading more, learning more Marxist theory, and examining the knowledge and viewpoints they have obtained from practice and multi-faceted learning. In the past, it was very difficult to study Marxism. In the early period, very few works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and other important authors were translated into Chinese. Only those who understood foreign languages ​​could directly read the original books. This was one difficulty. There are also difficulties caused by the reactionaries. They had long cried out that "extremism is coming", and searched everywhere for "extremist parties". Of course, books that promote "extremism" were also among the searches. During the Agrarian Revolutionary War, this reactionary measure became even more severe. Therefore, the publication of Marxist classics had to rely heavily on the publishing agencies established by the Party in Shanghai. However, Shanghai was a counter-revolutionary center where the three reactionary forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism were combined. The staff of our publishing agencies could not work there in an orderly manner, but could only "fight guerrilla warfare", publishing a book here and a book there; publishing a book under this name and a book under that name. In order to avoid the eyes of the censors, the wording in the books was often changed. For example, nouns such as "Marxist philosophy" and "proletariat" can be said that every censor would not let go, so they had to be replaced with more unfamiliar nouns such as "new philosophy" and "proletariat." This kind of noun is equivalent to a code, and it all depends on the readers to understand it themselves. There is a widely spread joke that actually happened. It is said that during the Agrarian Revolutionary War, a traveler carried a "Ma's Grammar" in his box, and was arrested by the censor because he was carrying Marxist propaganda and was imprisoned. In fact, "Ma's Grammar" was a Chinese grammar book written by Ma Jianzhong, a comprador in the late Qing Dynasty, in imitation of English grammar. Ma Jianzhong was one of the earliest representatives of the Chinese big bourgeoisie. His surname was Ma, but Marx's surname was Marx, which was completely irrelevant. However, the Kuomintang censor became nervous when he saw the word "Ma." From this, one can imagine how dangerous it was to read Marxist books at that time. Only those who were not afraid of being beheaded would try to find them to read. But there were indeed many people who were not afraid of being beheaded. They read Marxist books as if they were hungry and thirsty, carefully looking for revolutionary instructions from them, and resolutely threw themselves into actual struggles. At that time, it was also very difficult for Marxists to do scholarship, because the Communist Party had no money and could not supply them with a large number of books. They themselves had difficulty maintaining their lives, so where did they get so much money to buy books? Therefore, they had to try all kinds of poor ways to study hard. The conditions for us to study Marxism now and study Marxism in the past, and the conditions for doing scholarship now and doing scholarship in the past are completely different. We are now re-translating all the Marxist classics. The writing is more fluent than before, the expression is more accurate than before, and it is much easier to understand. Not only is there no danger of being beheaded for reading books, but it is encouraged in all aspects. There are also unprecedentedly good conditions for studying scholarship and becoming a learned Marxist. Classical and modern works by foreign thinkers are being published in large quantities. Chinese classical works are being reprinted in large quantities. Individuals cannot afford many books. Every university and every scientific institution has a considerable library, and the state has also established a large number of public libraries in various places. Our young people should understand how to use this condition and strive to become socialist builders who have both rich theoretical knowledge and rich practical knowledge.

    要认真学习理论
    理树
    在过去四十年中，我们党运用马克思主义解决中国问题，获得了伟大的成功。这个成功的标志就是毛泽东思想，就是中国革命的胜利和社会主义建设的发展。但是也应当承认，我们还缺乏一个足够强大的马克思主义理论工作者的队伍。要形成理论工作队伍，必须有数以万计的人学习马克思主义，大家都具备丰富的理论知识，并善于运用马克思主义来解决中国的实际问题。否则就会不成队伍。
    为了这个目的，就要读书。怎样读书？熟读马克思主义经典作家的著作是不是必要的？是必要的。我们当然反对用死读硬记的方法来学习，但是我们不能因此说不需要把书好好读熟。能够读熟，总是有益的。毛泽东同志说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它，应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”这几句话非常重要。精通就是要读得多，读得熟，能够领会。这是应用马克思主义的一个条件。没有这个条件，根本不知道或者很少知道马克思主义经典作家关于我们所要解决的问题讲过些什么，那就谈不到应用马克思主义。当然我们必须保持我们党的创造性地学习马克思主义理论的优良传统，即理论和实际联系的传统，不把理论看作教条，而把它看作行动的指南。应当做到像毛泽东同志所说的，“能够依据马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，正确地解释历史中和革命中所发生的实际问题，能够在中国的经济、政治、军事、文化种种问题上给予科学的解释，给予理论的说明。”当然，理论联系实际决不应当是理论的牵强附会的解释。牵强附会的解释不是理论联系实际，而是理论的庸俗化和教条化，这是我们所必须坚决反对的。
    我们如果要成为真正的马克思主义者，成为足以对我们时代的社会主义建设有贡献的马克思主义者，还不能只读马克思主义经典著作，不读古代和当代的别的著作。马克思主义经典著作是人类过去积累起来的全部知识的结晶，这是谁也不能否认的。但是我们决不能认为有了经典著作，有了人类过去积累起来的全部知识的结晶，就万事如意，可以把人类过去积累起来的全部知识扔掉了。人类过去积累起来的全部知识是一个伟大的宝藏。在人类对社会和自然的规律的认识中，有许多问题，前人曾经反复思考过，我们现在要继续思考，那么，前人在这些问题上所达到的成就，对于我们来说，就是珍宝。如果我们不利用前人的成就，不知道他们曾经在那些地方走过那些弯路，那就会有两种可能，或者落在前人的窠臼里，或者不如前人。我们一方面要努力研究当前的种种问题，另一方面还须要为了解决当前的问题而寻找前人的思想资料，开发前人的宝藏。马克思主义经典作家们已经开辟了探取这个宝藏的道路，提供了开发的钥匙，并且开发了其中的许多重要部分，我们应当沿着他们的道路，用他们提供的钥匙继续去开发。列宁指出，“只有确切地了解人类全部发展过程所创造的文化，只有对这种文化加以改造，才能建设无产阶级的文化，没有这样的认识，我们就不能完成这项任务。”他又说：“只有用人类创造的全部知识财富来丰富自己的头脑，才能成为共产主义者。”当然，在人类知识宝藏中藏着的并不全是珍宝，还有大量是泥沙，是奴隶社会、封建社会和资本主义社会遗留的毒素。所以开发这个宝藏，也好像“一千零一夜”中讲的开发宝藏的故事一样，是一件危险的事情。但是我们有马克思主义做武器，就可以不怕危险，就可以区别何者为珍宝，何者为泥沙，善于去其泥沙，取其珍宝。
    我们知道，所有马克思主义经典作家都是非常博学的人物。毛泽东同志就是我们这一时代中国最博学的人物。我们应当向他们学习，使自己成为博学的马克思主义者。英国的著名哲学家培根有一句名言，叫做“知识就是力量”。这话是对的。从前反动阶级实行愚民政策，可以说，正是为的要使劳动人民没有力量，便于他们的统治。按照马克思和恩格斯的分析，近代无产阶级的觉醒也正是与知识原素由资产阶级手里转移到无产阶级手里相关连的。我国无产阶级和劳动人民既然已经基本消灭了剥削阶级，成为国家的主人，自然也就应当力求全面地成为知识的主人，用丰富的知识来武装自己，才能充分实现和发挥人类的理想。毛泽东同志告诉我们党的各级负责同志说，为了做好党所委托的工作，必须具备多方面的知识，必须学点自然科学和技术科学，学点哲学和政治经济学，学点历史和法学，学点文学，学点文法和逻辑，中央和省市的负责同志还要争取学一种外国文。我们党的各级负责同志都是很忙的，他们每天都要办很多事情，但是毛泽东同志认为他们不管多么忙，还是要学这么多学科的知识。至于我们的青年同志，我们的科学工作者，我们的正在上学的学生，那就应当学得更多。当然，这决不是说，一个人应当什么都学。什么都学是不行的。有很多人可以成为多面手，但是按照一般的情形，应当是以马克思主义理论为指导，学好一门学科，同时兼及其他学科。例如，自然科学家不但应当精通自己所专攻的学科，同时兼及其他有关学科，并且应当具有丰富的哲学知识；哲学家不但应当力求精通全部哲学思想，而且应当具有丰富的自然科学知识；历史学家所需要的知识就比自然科学家和哲学家更多一些。而且所有这些人都应当学外国文，至少学一种，最好多学几种。
    要学这么多知识，当然是很苦的。不过革命者不应当怕刻苦。当然，所谓刻苦，决不是指损害健康，而是指在正常的条件下不错过光阴，突破学习上的难关。我们应当成为爱惜光阴的勤勉的人，除了参加一般的实际活动以外，尽可能把时间利用来进行学习。学生可以超过老师，今人可以超过前人，但是关键在于认真的学习。如果不学习，如果学习不是刻苦的，那就不用说超过老师，超过前人，就连自己眼前已经达到的水平也不会超过。
    听说现在有些人因为怕犯教条主义错误，不敢讲系统学习。他们说，讲理论讲系统了，就会变成教条，或者被指摘为教条主义。这种思想是错误的。理论变成教条，决不是因为它本身有系统或者讲的人讲得有系统，而是因为教条主义者把它当作教条去理解。我们反对教条主义，但是丝毫不包含反对读书、反对系统学习或者系统讲授理论的意思。不应当认为读书就是教条主义，如果思想方法不对，不读书也会犯教条主义错误。在我国革命斗争中，有些同志犯教条主义错误，难道是因为读书太多吗？不是的。他们不是读书太多，而是读书太少，接受前人的知识太少，片面地理解他所得到的一点可怜的理论知识。所以改正教条主义的方法，固然应当首先要求理论和实践统一，加强在实际工作中的锻炼，同时也应当重视多读书，多学习马克思主义理论，从实践中和多方面的学习中检验自己所得到的知识和观点。在过去，学习马克思主义曾经是非常困难的。最初一个时期，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林以及其他重要作者的著作译成中文的很少，只有懂得外国文的人可以直接阅读原书，这是一层困难。还有反动派造成的困难。他们老早就叫唤“过激主义来了”，到处查拿“过激党”，当然，宣传“过激主义”的书也是在查拿之列的。在土地革命战争时期，这种反动措施就更加严厉。因此，马克思主义经典著作的出版，不能不大量依靠党在上海建立的出版机关。可是上海是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三种反动势力结合起来的反革命中心，我们的出版机关的工作人员并不能安然在那里按部就班地进行工作，而只能“打游击”，这里出一本，那里出一本；用这个名字出一本，用那个名字出一本。为了避开检查官的眼睛，书里面的用语也常有改动。例如“马克思主义哲学”、“无产阶级”这一类的名词，可说是每个检查官都不肯放过的，于是只好改用“新哲学”、“普罗列达利亚”这样比较生疏的名词来代替。这种名词等于暗号，全靠读者自己去领会。有一个流传很广的实有其事的笑话，据说在土地革命战争时期，有个旅客在他的箱子里带了一本“马氏文通”，竟被检查官认为携带了马克思主义宣传品而把他捉去关进了监牢。其实“马氏文通”是清朝末年一个名叫马建忠的洋务派分子仿照英文文法写的一本中国文法书。马建忠是中国大资产阶级最早的代表人之一，他姓马，马克思却姓马克思，根本不相干。可是国民党检查官看见了“马”字就神经紧张。由此也就可以想见，当时读马克思主义书籍是多么危险的事。只有那些不怕杀头的人，才会想方设法找来读。但是确有很多人不怕杀头，他们如饥如渴地阅读马克思主义书籍，精心地从里面寻找革命的指示，并坚决地投进了实际斗争。那时马克思主义者做学问也是很困难的，因为共产党没有钱，不能大量供给他们书籍。他们自己连生活都难于维持，那来许多钱买书？所以只有想尽各种穷办法去苦学。我们现在学马克思主义和过去学马克思主义，现在做学问和过去做学问，条件完全不同了。我们现在把马克思主义经典著作全部重新翻译，文字比从前流利，达意比从前准确，读起来好懂多了。读书的人不但没有杀头的危险，而且是受到各方面鼓励的。研究学问，做一个博学的马克思主义者，也有了空前最好的条件。外国思想家的古典著作和近代著作正在大量出版。中国古典著作正在大量翻印。个人买不起许多书，每个高等学校和每个科学机关都有很可观的图书馆，国家还在各地设立了大量公共图书馆。我们的青年应当懂得利用这个条件，努力使自己成为既有丰富理论知识又有丰富实际知识的社会主义建设者。
