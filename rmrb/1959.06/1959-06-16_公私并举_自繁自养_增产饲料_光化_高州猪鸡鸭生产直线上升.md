    Public and Private Efforts, Self-Breeding and Self-Raising, Increased Feed Production
    Pig, Chicken, and Duck Production Rises Sharply in Guanghua and Gaozhou
    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 15th) Guanghua County, Hubei Province, has thoroughly implemented the principles of combining collective and private raising, combining breeding and fattening, combining fixed feed bases and expanding feed sources, and combining strengthened leadership with fully mobilizing the masses, rapidly and comprehensively launching a new upsurge in increasing production of livestock and poultry, centered on developing pigs. The county now has more than 53,470 pigs, averaging more than one pig per farmer household; more than 166,000 chickens, averaging more than three per household; in addition, it also raises more than 13,500 sheep, 10,000 ducks and geese, 2,500 rabbits, and 1,900 cages of bees.
    The production teams, production groups, and collective canteens of the rural people's communes in this county have now basically established collective pig farms at every level, established fixed feed bases, and also raised basic breeding sows and boars for self-breeding and self-raising. Supporting members' private pig raising is a glorious responsibility of the collective pig farms, and all communes and teams actively help members solve the problem of pig sources. The Qunjian Production Team of the Zhulinqiao Commune, which was rated as a red flag team for developing pigs in the county, has 357 households and more than 1,600 people. It now raises 1,616 pigs, basically achieving one pig per person.
    Leaders at all levels in Guanghua County attach great importance to solving the problem of feed for pigs and other livestock and poultry. In addition to the production teams and groups retaining a certain amount of feed grain according to national policy, the most important thing is to rely on and mobilize the broad masses to expand feed sources in every possible way. Since last winter, the county has expanded the vegetable acreage by more than 17,000 mu. In addition to meeting the needs of rural canteens and urban edible vegetables, a large amount of coarse vegetables can also be saved as feed. The county has discovered and collected as many as 72 kinds of wild feed. In the summer harvest and summer planting, in order to increase grain and feed production, the county has also launched a mass movement to plant more and harvest more, which can yield about 10 million jin of grain and 100 million jin of melons and vegetables. The Zhangji Commune has taken the "bean ash" (stem, leaf, and pod powder of silkworms and peas) accumulated in the bean threshing ground, and after leaving a portion for the collective pig farm, has distributed 110,000 jin to each household to help members solve the problem of pig feed.

    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th) In recent months, pig and chicken, duck, and goose production in Gaozhou County, Guangdong Province, has risen sharply. At present, the county has more than 332,000 pigs, an increase of more than 28,000 from mid-February; chickens, ducks, and geese have increased from more than 570,000 to more than 1,880,000, an increase of more than two times.
    Gaozhou County's implementation of the production policy of emphasizing both public and private raising has been achieved through meticulous ideological work. Many commune cadres originally worried that members raising pigs would hinder collective labor, and were not active enough in supporting members' private pig raising. Should public and private raising be emphasized equally? Various meetings were held in various places to discuss this issue.
    After the ideological problem was solved, all 14 communes in the county specifically formulated production measures to implement both public and private raising. In addition to conscientiously grasping collective pig raising, it is also necessary to specifically help members raise pigs. The practice of the Dong'an Production Brigade of the Zhenlong Commune is that pig seedlings are supplied by the team and issued to members at a discount; the team allocates part of the land as feed land. At present, more than 1,300 households in the entire brigade have raised more than 1,500 pigs. The county has planted 320,000 mu of feed crops. All communes have combined the ideological education of members on the consistency of collective and individual interests, and have correspondingly formulated systems to resolve the contradiction between collective production and household sideline occupations.

    公私并举　自繁自养　增产饲料
    光化  高州猪鸡鸭生产直线上升
    本报武汉15日电　湖北省光化县贯彻集体喂养与私人喂养相结合，繁殖与育肥相结合，固定饲料基地与广辟饲料来源相结合，加强领导与充分发动群众相结合的方针，迅速地全面地掀起了以发展生猪为中心的家畜家禽新的增产高潮。全县现有生猪五万三千四百七十多头，平均每个农户养猪一头多；养鸡十六万六千多只，平均每户三只以上；此外，还养了羊一万三千五百多只，鸭和鹅一万只，家兔两千五百多只，蜜蜂一千九百多笼。
    这个县的农村人民公社的生产队、生产小队和集体食堂，现在基本上层层建立了集体养猪场，建立了固定的饲料基地，还饲养了自繁自养的基本母猪和公猪群。扶持社员私人养猪是集体养猪场的一项光荣职责，各社、队都积极地帮助社员解决猪源问题。被评为全县发展生猪的红旗队的竹林桥公社群建生产队，全队三百五十七户，一千六百多人，现在养猪一千六百十六头，基本上达到每人一头猪。
    光化县各级领导对解决生猪和其他家畜家禽饲料问题都十分重视。除按国家政策由生产队和小队留一定数量的饲料粮，最主要的是依靠和发动广大群众千方百计地扩大饲料来源。自去冬以来，全县扩大了蔬菜面积一万七千多亩，除满足农村食堂和城镇食用蔬菜外，还可节余大量粗菜充作饲料。全县已发现和采集的野生饲料达到七十二种之多。在夏收夏种中，为了增产粮和饲料，全县又掀起了群众性多种多收运动，大约可以多收一千万斤粮和一亿斤瓜菜。张集公社把打豆场积存的“豆灰”（蚕、豌豆的茎叶荚粉末），除了留给集体养猪场一部分，已经拿出十一万斤分给各户，帮助社员解决养猪饲料问题。

    本报广州15日电　广东省高州县近几个月来，生猪和鸡、鸭、鹅生产直线上升。目前全县已有生猪三十三万二千多头，比2月中旬增加了二万八千多头；鸡、鸭、鹅由五十七万多只增加到一百八十八万多只，增加了两倍多。
    高州县贯彻公养私养并重的生产方针，是经过细致的思想工作的。许多公社干部，原来担心社员养猪会妨碍集体劳动，对于支持社员私人养猪不够积极。究竟要不要公养私养并重？各地先后召开了各种会议进行讨论。
    思想问题解决以后，全县十四个公社都具体地订出实行公养和私养并重的生产措施。除了认真抓好集体养猪外，还要具体帮助社员养猪。镇隆公社东岸生产大队的做法是，猪苗由队里供应，折价发放给社员；队里拨出部分土地，作为饲料地。现在，全大队一千三百多户，已养有生猪一千五百多头。全县已种饲料作物三十二万亩。各地公社都结合对社员进行集体利益和个人利益一致性的思想教育，相应地订出了制度，以解决集体生产和家庭副业之间的矛盾。
