Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: After finishing their graduation exams, more than 11,000 graduating high school students in Beijing have entered the final stage of their secondary school life: systematically reviewing high school courses and actively preparing for entrance exams. Relevant Party committees, administrative departments, and schools are seizing the opportunity to strengthen the entrance guidance for these graduates, both ideologically and professionally.

In order to deliver qualified graduates to higher education institutions, many schools have organized teachers to systematically guide students in reviewing their coursework during the final stage of their studies. Review plans are drawn up based on the entrance exam syllabus of the higher education institutions, the teaching syllabus of the high school courses, and the students' learning situation, so that the review is systematic and focused. In the review process, there are lectures from teachers and ample time for students to study independently in a down-to-earth manner. Some high school senior teachers even make cards of each student's learning problems to provide effective tutoring. Teachers also help students plan their time and improve their learning efficiency. During the intense review period, schools pay attention to the sleep and rest of teachers and students, appropriately carry out some recreational and sports activities, and also pay attention to improving meals, so that students can meet the entrance exams with full energy.

These graduating students are studying hard and are full of vigor. They say that they will choose their different college aspirations based on the country's multifaceted needs and combined with their personal specific conditions. Relevant Party organizations and educational administrative departments in Beijing have strengthened ideological education work on students' college entrance issues, helping them to correct their attitude towards college entrance, understand the majors of higher education institutions, and better choose their aspirations. In Xicheng and Dongcheng districts, where there are more graduating students, the district committee secretaries or deputy district heads in charge of cultural and educational work made reports to the students. School administration and Party and Youth League organizations also carried out more detailed ideological work in various ways, such as reports, seminars, individual talks, and visits, according to the students' ideological situation, so that many students realized that all majors are cultivating talents needed by the country, and that there are only differences in the division of labor. Li Yonglian, a senior high school student at Beijing No. 1 Middle School, is one of the top students in his class and has won a medal for academic excellence. In the graduation exam, except for one subject where he scored a four, all the other eight subjects were five. Because of his love for the teaching profession, he visited Beijing Normal University and read some articles on education when choosing his college aspirations. He realized the importance of education in the country's socialist construction and confidently chose a teacher training major as his first choice. Some students, after labor training and ideological education, have established the idea of not being afraid of getting dirty or tired and are preparing to take geology, prospecting, petroleum, and other majors as their aspirations.

    加紧复习功课　迎接升学考试
    首都一万多名应届高中毕业生努力学习
    据新华社10日讯　北京一万一千多名应届高中毕业生结束毕业考试后，进入了中学学习生活的最后阶段——系统复习高中课程，积极准备升学考试。有关党委、行政部门和学校正抓紧时机，从思想上、业务上加强对这些毕业生进行升学指导。
    为了向高等学校输送合格的毕业生，许多学校在应届毕业生的学习最后阶段，都组织教师有计划地指导学生复习功课。根据高等学校的考试大纲、高中课程的教学大纲以及学生学习情况，订出学生的复习计划，使复习有系统、又有重点。在复习中，有教师的讲授，又有较多的时间给学生踏踏实实地自修。有些学校高三班的教师们还将班上每个学生学习中的问题，做成卡片，对学生有效地进行辅导。教师们还帮助学生有计划地支配时间，提高学习效率。在紧张的复习中，学校都注意师生的睡眠和休息，适当开展一些文娱体育活动，同时注意改善伙食，使学生们精神饱满地迎接升学考试。
    这些应届毕业生努力学习，生气蓬勃，他们表示要从国家多方面的需要出发，结合个人的具体条件来选择各自不同的升学志愿。北京市有关的党组织和教育行政部门对学生升学问题上抓紧了思想教育工作，帮助他们端正升学态度，了解高等学校专业情况，更好地选择志愿。应届毕业生人数较多的西城区和东城区，都由负责文教工作的区委书记或副区长向学生们作了报告，学校行政和党团组织也针对学生思想情况，用报告、座谈、个别谈心、参观访问等各种方式进行了比较细致的思想工作，使许多学生认识到，各种专业都是为国家培养所需要的人材，只有分工的不同。北京市第一中学高三学生李永濂是班上学习成绩比较优秀的学生，曾获得学习优良奖章，毕业考试中，除一门功课考了四分外，其余八门都是五分。他由于喜爱教师职业，在选择升学志愿时他访问了北京师范大学，阅读了一些有关教育的文章，认识到教育事业在国家社会主义建设中的重要性，便充满信心地选择了师范专业作为自己的第一志愿。有些学生经过了劳动锻炼和思想教育，树立了不怕脏、不怕累的思想，准备以地质、探矿、石油等专业作为自己的志愿。
