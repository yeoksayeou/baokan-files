    Notes
    Rascal and "Hero"
    American propagandists are quite adept at the way of the rascal. The June 8th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" brazenly denied the U.S.'s crime of inciting civil war in Laos and creating the Laotian crisis, claiming it was a "war of nerves" by "Moscow and Peking," which was not the case at all.
    However, what makes a rascal a rascal is that while he denies something, he turns around, pats his chest, and boasts that he is a "hero." Isn't that so? The same issue of "U.S. News & World Report" admitted that "Laos is getting closer and closer to the United States. U.S. aid is taking effect." Before this, the June 1st issue of "Newsweek" was even more carried away, even calling the U.S.'s instigation of the Laotian authorities to undermine peace as a "near-miraculous achievement."
    In fact, without American propagandists boasting themselves, people would never obliterate the "near-miraculous achievements" of the U.S. in Laos. If you want to play the role of an anti-peace "hero," don't act like a rascal in public. You can't have both rascality and "heroism."

    "Ominous Signs" and "Vigilance"
    The "New York Herald Tribune" called Singapore's recent achievement of internal autonomy and the establishment of a government headed by Lee Kuan Yew, the Secretary-General of the People's Action Party, an "event filled with ominous signs," and clamored that Southeast Asian countries should raise "vigilance" against it.
    Wonderful! Singapore is neither an American colony nor a state of the U.S.; its achievement of autonomy and the establishment of its own government, for the United States across the ocean, what's it to them!
    Upon careful thought, the U.S. has some reason to be afraid. It may be worried that if the people of Singapore continue to advance on the road to independence in the future, the U.S. Marines may not be able to, as in the past, simply rely on the "permission" of the British authorities to land in Singapore for "rest and recreation." Everyone remembers last August, when the U.S. and Britain launched armed aggression in the Middle East, eight ships of the U.S. Seventh Fleet carrying two thousand U.S. Marines hurried from Okinawa to Singapore, landing for "very pleasant rest and recreation." In this sense, Singapore's implementation of autonomy and the establishment of the Lee Kuan Yew government have a bit of "ominous signs" for the U.S. Southeast Asian countries should indeed raise "vigilance," but not "vigilance" against others, but precisely be wary of those U.S. Marines who specialize in going to other countries for "rest and recreation," and when they will suddenly "land for a visit" again.

    札记
    无赖与“好汉”
    美国的宣传家们颇长无赖之道。6月8日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”当众狡赖美国煽起老挝内战，制造老挝危机的罪行，说什么这是“莫斯科和北平”的“神经战”，实无其事。
    但是，无赖之所以为无赖也，在于他一边进行抵赖；一边却转过身来向人拍拍胸膛，吹嘘自己是一条“好汉”。不是吗？同一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”就承认，“老挝与美国愈来愈接近。美援在发生作用”。前此，6月1日的美国“新闻周刊”更加得意忘形，甚至把美国教唆老挝当局破坏和平的行为称为“近似奇迹的成就”。
    其实，不用美国宣传家自己吹嘘，人们绝不会抹煞美国在老挝的“近似奇迹的成就”的。既要充当反和平的“好汉”，就不要当众耍赖。无赖与“好汉”不可兼而得之也。“凶兆”和“警惕”“纽约先驱论坛报”把新加坡最近实现内部自治和成立以人民行动党总书记李光耀为首的政府，称之为“充满着凶兆的事件”，并且大叫大嚷东南亚国家应对此提高“警惕”。
    妙哉！新加坡既非美国殖民地，更非美国之一州；它的实现自治和成立自己的政府，对于远隔重洋的美国来说，干卿底事！
    仔细一想，美国害怕也有一些道理。它可能是担忧：如果新加坡人民今后继续在争取独立的道路上前进，美国海军陆战队恐怕就不能像过去那样，单凭英国当局的“准许”，就随便在新加坡登陆进行“休息和娱乐”了。大家还记得去年8月，正当美英在中东发动武装侵略的时候，美国第七舰队的八艘军舰载着二千名美国海军陆战队从冲绳匆匆开往新加坡，上岸“进行十分愉快的休息和娱乐”。从这个意义上来说，新加坡的实行自治和李光耀政府的成立，对于美国不无一点“凶兆”之意。东南亚国家倒是应该提高“警惕”，但不是“警惕”旁的，却恰恰是提防那些专门好上别人国家去进行“休息和娱乐”的美国海军陆战队，什么时候又突如其来地“登陆访问”。
