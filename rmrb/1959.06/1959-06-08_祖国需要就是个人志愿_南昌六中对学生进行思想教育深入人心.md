The Motherland's Needs are the Individual's Aspirations
Nanchang No. 6 Middle School's Ideological Education of Students Strikes a Deep Chord

(Reported by this newspaper) To ensure the quantity and quality of national enrollment, Nanchang No. 6 Middle School, under the leadership of the Party branch and in close cooperation with relevant parties, has been conducting political and ideological education and review preparation work for graduating students.

Nanchang No. 6 Middle School has seven graduating classes this year, with a total of 312 graduates. The Party branch began providing guidance on further education for graduates as early as December last year. After the start of this semester, under the direct leadership of the Party branch, a guidance working group for graduating classes was established, including the head teachers of each senior third grade class, to make specific arrangements for the work of the graduating classes, proposing: focus on both learning and aspirations. After in-depth understanding by the head teachers, it was believed that the students in the graduating classes, after vigorously implementing the Party's education policy, had greatly improved their political awareness; however, due to the influence of bourgeois ideology and contact with specific individual issues, there were still some one-sidedness and blindness in the issue of further education.

Based on this situation, the secretary of the school's Party branch made a mobilization report to the graduating students on correctly choosing their educational aspirations, calling on students to go to the places where the motherland needs them most. Then, the school organized the League cadres and all League members to conduct discussions, first solving the thinking of the cadres and League members, so that they could influence and drive the students with practical actions. The school also organized graduates to visit Jiangxi Normal College, inviting Vice President Xin Xiu to give a report, clarifying many of the students' incorrect ideas.

While guiding further education, the school paid special attention to grasping the quality of learning. They took various measures to criticize the ideas of fearing difficulties, not wanting to pursue further education, and relaxing learning because it was easy to get into school. On this basis, each graduating class launched a new high tide of review and preparation. They proposed: "The Party's needs are my first aspiration!" "Wherever the Party points, we will rush there!"

    祖国需要就是个人志愿
    南昌六中对学生进行思想教育深入人心
    本报讯　为了保证国家招生的数量与质量，南昌市第六中学在党支部领导下，和有关方面密切合作，对应届毕业生进行了政治思想教育与温课备考工作。
    南昌六中今年有七个毕业班，共有毕业生三百一十二人。对于毕业生的升学指导工作，党支部早在去年12月份就开始了。本学期开始后，在党支部的直接领导下，又成立了包括高三各班班主任参加的毕业班指导工作小组，对毕业班的工作作了具体部署，提出：既抓学习，又抓志愿。经过班主任的深入了解，认为毕业班的同学经过大力贯彻党的教育方针后，政治觉悟有了很大提高；但由于资产阶级的思想影响和接触到个人的具体问题，在升学问题上还存有片面性和盲目性。
    根据这一情况，学校党支部书记向应届毕业生，作了正确选择升学志愿的动员报告，号召学生到祖国最需要的地方去。接着，又组织团干部和全体团员进行讨论，首先解决干部和团员的思想，使他们以实际行动影响和带动同学。学校又组织毕业生到江西师范学院参观和访问，请副院长信修同志做了报告，澄清了学生们许多错误思想。
    学校在指导升学的同时，特别注意抓学习质量。他们采取各种办法批判了害怕困难，不想升学，和升学容易而放松学习的思想。在这一基础上，各毕业班又掀起了一个温课复习的学习高潮。他们提出：“党的需要就是我的第一志愿！”“党指向那里就奔向那里！”
