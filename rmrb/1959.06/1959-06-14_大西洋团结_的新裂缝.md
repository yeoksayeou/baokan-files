New Cracks in "Atlantic Solidarity"
	Shi Lü

Since the beginning of this year, the leaders of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc have launched a series of activities under the pretext of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the group's founding. All these activities are aimed at promoting the notorious "Atlantic policy" and deceiving the broad masses of people in the member states; at the same time, to a large extent, they are also aimed at patching up the ever-widening cracks within the group. The recent "Atlantic Conference" held in London was an important part of these activities.

This "Atlantic Conference," which lasted six days from June 5th to 10th, was of a non-official nature. However, judging from the fact that the representatives of the North Atlantic Group countries attending the conference included many important figures from political, economic, cultural, and military circles, the leaders of the North Atlantic Group clearly had great expectations for this conference. In his congratulatory telegram to the conference, US President Eisenhower clearly hoped that "the distinguished ordinary citizens of the Atlantic Alliance member states attending this conference" would "make a great contribution" to promoting "the cause of understanding" between the countries of this group.

However, just as Eisenhower was playing the "Solidarity March," and during the "Atlantic Conference," a new and growing quarrel broke out between the US overlord and one of its main European partners, France, causing chaos and shock within the North Atlantic Group. Western bourgeois journalists exclaimed that "Western solidarity" had "suddenly broken down." This shows that the tendency of the North Atlantic Group to fall apart has developed further.

This new quarrel between the United States and France, on the surface, is due to the United States' refusal to allow France to participate in the joint management of US nuclear weapons stored on French territory, so France simply refused to allow the United States to store nuclear weapons on French territory. In reality, it is far more than just a matter of jointly managing nuclear weapons, but a much deeper struggle for control and counter-control. From the French side, in the short year since de Gaulle came to power, he initially scuttled the negotiations between the United States and France on establishing US missile bases in France by making the condition that France control the nuclear warheads; then he refused to put the French fighter fleet under the command of the North Atlantic Group headquarters controlled by an American general; not long ago, he decided that the French fleet in the Mediterranean would be controlled by France itself, whether in peacetime or wartime; and this time, he is using the refusal to allow the United States to store nuclear weapons to coerce the United States into granting the right to jointly manage nuclear weapons. The reason why de Gaulle has repeatedly carried out what US Senator Jackson angrily denounced as "blackmail" against the United States is that his goal is not only to have the United States recognize France's right to "equal footing," but also to have the United States help France (such as providing atomic intelligence) to join the ranks of "atomic powers." In de Gaulle's mind, France becoming an "atomic power" can, first, deter the national liberation movements in Algeria and other overseas colonies, so as to maintain the French colonial empire from collapsing; second, intimidate the democratic and progressive movements of the French people, so as to maintain his dictatorial and reactionary rule; and third, get rid of US control and compete with the US, Britain, and West Germany in the Western European market, so as to compete for European hegemony. Achieving three goals in one fell swoop is the basic goal of de Gaulle's policy, and this is the fundamental reason why he constantly creates "independence" within the North Atlantic Group. If he doesn't make trouble on this issue, he will make trouble on that issue, or if he makes trouble today and temporarily compromises, he will start again tomorrow.

From the US side, firmly grasping control of the North Atlantic Group to ensure that this group becomes a handy tool for US aggression is the basic principle of the US in handling internal affairs of the North Atlantic Group. Therefore, although de Gaulle has been making a lot of noise on the issue of demanding "atomic power" status, the United States has always adopted the approach of suppressing it if it can be suppressed, and pouring cold water on it if it cannot be suppressed. In short, it ignores it. The reason why the United States implements the "atomic policy of not telling friends the atomic secrets that the enemy already knows," which the French "Le Monde" denounces as "extremely absurd," is precisely because the United States expects to maintain atomic deterrence against its allies in order to ensure that these allies accept control. Therefore, in the eyes of the United States, de Gaulle's request to participate in the joint management of nuclear weapons is exactly equivalent to handing over the US's magic weapon for controlling the North Atlantic Group, because if this trend continues, all other allies will follow France's example, and everyone will have the right to jointly manage nuclear weapons, what will the United States use to control and deter these partners? No wonder American congressmen are clamoring that "we cannot succumb to France's blackmail," and the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group "Allied Forces," American General Norstad, is threatening to retaliate against France.

France's daring to carry out "blackmail" against the United States one after another also shows, on the other hand, that the US leadership in the North Atlantic Group is declining. Today's United States, in the general international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, has seen its prestige decline and its position become increasingly isolated due to the constant setbacks of the US ruling group's aggressive policies over the years. It no longer has the kind of power it once had to arbitrarily bully its allies. On the contrary, the United States is very afraid that France's "blackmail" will resonate among other allies, and that everyone will challenge the US leadership. US Secretary of State Herter hurriedly convened an emergency meeting of the foreign ministers of the US, Britain, and France in Geneva; US officials tried their best to conceal the dispute with France and touted "cooperation"; after expressing "regret" in a roundabout way for France's "arrogant attitude," the "New York Times," the mouthpiece of the US ruling group, could only ask for talks between France and the US to "negotiate a new basis for our longest-standing alliance." This cautious and conciliatory attitude of the United States is clearly not without foundation. Immediately after France's "blackmail," fifty British Labor MPs in the House of Commons "demanded that the British government follow France in refusing to store nuclear warheads kept by the United States," eighty Labor MPs jointly proposed a motion against the United States transferring its air force stationed in France to Britain, and the "Daily Mirror," which has a large circulation in Britain, demanded that Britain share command of the air force transferred from France by the United States. There is no reason to believe that this wave of resonance with France will not spread from London to Rome, Bonn, Oslo, Copenhagen, and so on. It seems that the United States will have many more headaches!

Of course, today's US's use of gentle methods to deal with France's challenge does not mean that it will not pick up the big stick tomorrow. However, neither soft nor hard methods can help to alleviate the struggle for control and counter-control between the two sides. The relationship between the United States and France is like this, and the relationship with other allies is no different. At the "Atlantic Conference" in London, the US representatives demanded "more centralization within the alliance," while representatives of some other small countries demanded "the speedy formulation of a common new policy for all member states of the North Atlantic Treaty," in other words, the small countries demanded more say. This also reflects the sentiment of these countries against US control.

Among the partners other than the US overlord, there have recently been new developments in their mutual infighting. Britain is actively wooing Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, and Portugal to establish a "seven-nation free trade area" to counter the six-nation "common market" composed of West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. It is obvious that Britain's aim in establishing this "small free trade area" is mainly to squeeze West Germany, Britain's economic rival, out of the seven-nation market, in retaliation for West Germany's attempt to squeeze Britain out of the six-nation "common market." Even within the six-nation "common market," although this organization, whose purpose is to compete with Britain, has only been open for five months, facts have already proven that the "solidarity" between the six countries, especially between West Germany and France, has no common foundation. The capitalist economic laws of the strong preying on the weak and competing for profits make the reciprocal clauses of the "common market" treaty almost a dead letter in practice. For example, on the one hand, the six countries mutually reduce tariffs, and on the other hand, they compete with each other by various means to obstruct the import of goods from other member states.

The contradictions between the overlord and the partners, and the contradictions between the partners themselves, all make Eisenhower's boasting in his congratulatory telegram to the "Atlantic Conference" that "a close cooperation unprecedented in peacetime has developed between the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance" a laughable Arabian Nights tale. While paying lip service to "Atlantic solidarity," the leaders of the North Atlantic Group hope to use the means of intensifying the "Cold War" and stepping up expansion into Asia, Africa, and Latin America to stimulate the "fighting spirit" of the member states of this group, turn their guns outward, and eliminate internal contradictions. The content of the resolutions passed by the "Atlantic Conference" shows this hope. However, this hope is doomed to failure. Stepping up the implementation of the "Atlantic policy" can only result in greater failures, which in turn can only further deepen the contradictions within the North Atlantic Group. The so-called "Atlantic solidarity" is nothing but empty talk.

    “大西洋团结”的新裂缝
    施旅
    今年以来，北大西洋侵略集团的领导人借着所谓庆祝这个集团成立十周年的名义，展开了一系列的活动。所有这些活动，既是为了推销臭名远扬的“大西洋政策”，欺骗各成员国的广大人民；同时，在很大的程度上，也是为了弥补该集团内部日益扩大的裂缝。最近在伦敦举行的“大西洋会议”，就是这类活动的一个重要环节。
    这个从6月5日到10日，历时六天的“大西洋会议”，虽然是非官方性质的，但是，从出席这个会议的北大西洋集团各国的代表中包括不少政治、经济、文化和军事各界重要人物这一点看来，北大西洋集团的领导人对这个会议显然是抱着很大期望的。美国总统艾森豪威尔在他的给这个会议的贺电中，就明确地指望“出席这次大会的大西洋联盟各成员国的杰出普通公民”对于促进这一集团各国之间的“谅解的事业”“能作出巨大的贡献”。
    然而，就在艾森豪威尔奏出“团结进行曲”的同时，就在“大西洋会议”召开期间，美国盟主和它的欧洲主要伙伴之一的法国之间，爆发了一场新的方兴未艾的争吵，在北大西洋集团内部引起了一片混乱和震惊。西方资产阶级记者惊呼“西方团结”已经“突然破裂”。这表明：北大西洋集团四分五裂的趋向又有了发展。
    美法之间这一场新争吵，表面上是由于美国拒绝法国参与共管美国储存在法国领土上的核武器，因此法国便干脆拒绝美国在法国领土上储存核武器；实际上远不是一个仅仅共管核武器的问题，而是一场深刻得多的控制与反控制的斗争。从法国这方面来说，戴高乐在上台以后短短一年期间，始则以由法国掌握核弹头为条件，而使美法之间关于在法国建立美国导弹基地的谈判夭折；继则拒绝把法国的战斗机队归美国将军控制的北大西洋集团司令部指挥；不久前又决定不论在和平或战争时期，法国在地中海的舰队都由法国自己控制；这回又以拒绝美国储存核武器来要挟美国给予共管核武器的权利。戴高乐所以这样一而再、再而三地向美国进行美国参议员杰克逊所愤愤然指斥的“讹诈”，其目的就是不但要美国承认法国有“平起平坐”的权利，而且要美国帮助法国（如提供原子情报）跻身于“原子大国”的行列。在戴高乐的心目中，法国成为“原子大国”就可以一则威慑阿尔及利亚和其他海外殖民地的民族解放运动，以维系法兰西殖民帝国免于崩溃；二则恐吓法国人民的民主进步运动，以保持他的独裁反动统治；三则摆脱美国的控制而同美、英、西德角斗于西欧市场，以争夺欧洲霸权。一举而三得，这是戴高乐政策的基本目标，这就是他不时要在北大西洋集团内部闹“独立性”的根本原因。不在这个问题上闹，就要在那个问题上闹，或者是今天闹过了，暂时妥协了，明天又会重新闹起来。
    从美国这方面来说，牢牢把住对北大西洋集团的控制权，以保证这一集团成为美国的得心应手的侵略工具，这是美国处理北大西洋集团内部事务的基本原则。因此，尽管戴高乐在要求“原子大国”地位这一问题上闹得很欢，美国始终采取能压就压，不能压就泼冷水，总之是给予一个不理不睬。美国所以执行那种被法国“世界报”斥之为“极荒谬”的“不把敌人已明摆着知道的原子秘密告诉朋友的原子政策”，正是因为美国指望对它的盟国保持原子威慑力量，以保证这些盟国接受控制。因此，戴高乐这回要求参与共管核武器，在美国看来，恰好是等于缴出美国控制北大西洋集团的法宝，因为，如果此风一长，所有其他盟国都援法国之例，大家都对核武器有共管权，美国还拿什么去控制和威慑这些伙伴呢？难怪美国的议员老爷要叫嚷“不能对法国的讹诈屈服”，北大西洋集团“盟军”最高司令美国将军诺斯塔德威胁着要对法国实行报复了。
    法国敢于接二连三地向美国进行“讹诈”，在另一方面也表明了美国在北大西洋集团的领导地位的每况愈下。今天的美国，在东风劲吹西风衰的国际总形势下，由于美国统治集团的侵略政策连年来不断碰壁，威望日益下降，地位日益孤立，已经不再具有当年那种可以任意凌逼它的盟国的威风了。相反的，美国却是十分害怕法国这回的“讹诈”在其他盟国中间引起共鸣，大家都来向美国的领导权挑战。美国国务卿赫脱连忙在日内瓦召集美英法三国外长的紧急会议；美国官方人物竭力掩饰同法国的纷争并且鼓吹“合作”；美国统治集团的喉舌“纽约时报”在对法国的“傲慢态度”委曲地表示了一下“遗憾”之后，只能要求法美之间进行会谈来“谈判我们最悠久的联盟的新基础”了。美国这番小心翼翼地委曲求全的态度，显然不是没有根据的。就在法国的“讹诈”之后，英国五十名工党议员在下院“要求英政府仿效法国拒绝储存由美国保管的核弹头”，八十名工党议员联名提出反对美国把驻法空军调至英国的动议，在英国销路甚广的“每日镜报”要求英国对美国从法国移驻来的空军分享指挥权。人们没有理由相信这种同法国共鸣的声波不会再从伦敦延展到罗马、波恩、奥斯陆、哥本哈根等等地方去。看来，使美国头痛的日子还有的是呢！
    当然，今天美国以和缓的手法来对付法国的挑战，并不意味着它明天不会拿起大棒。然而，软的也好，硬的也好，都无补于缓和双方之间的控制与反控制的斗争。美国同法国的关系是如此，同其他盟国之间的关系也无不如此。在伦敦的“大西洋会议”上，美国代表要求“在联盟内部实行更多的集中”，而其他一些小国的代表则要求“火速制订出北大西洋公约所有成员国共同的新政策”，换句话说，小国要求更多的发言权。这也反映这些国家反对美国控制的情绪。
    在除了美国盟主之外的各伙伴之间，它们相互的倾轧最近也有新的发展。英国正在积极拉拢瑞典、挪威、丹麦、瑞士、奥地利和葡萄牙建立一个“七国自由贸易区”以抗衡西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡组成的六国“共同市场”。显而易见，英国建立这个“小自由贸易区”的目的主要在于把西德这个英国的经济劲敌排挤出七国市场，以报复西德的企图把英国排挤出六国“共同市场”。即使在六国“共同市场”内部，虽然这一目的在于同英国一决雌雄的机构开张才五个多月，事实已经证明六国之间特别是西德和法国之间的“团结”远无共同的基础。弱肉强食、竞逐利润的资本主义经济规律，使得“共同市场”条约的互惠条款在实践中几乎成为虚文。比如，六国一方面互相降低关税，另一方面又竞相以各种手段来阻挠其他成员国商品的进口。
    盟主与各伙伴之间的矛盾，各个伙伴相互之间的矛盾，这一切使得艾森豪威尔在他致“大西洋会议”的贺电中所吹嘘的“各北大西洋联盟成员国之间，已经发展了一种在和平时期从未有过的密切合作”，成为令人忍俊不禁的天方夜谈。北大西洋集团的领导人在空谈“大西洋团结”之余，指望用加剧“冷战”和加紧向亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲地区扩张的手段，来激发这一集团各成员国的“斗志”，枪口朝外，消弭内部矛盾。“大西洋会议”所通过的各项决议的内容就表明了这种指望。然而，这种指望是注定要破产的，加紧执行“大西洋政策”只能得到遭受更大失败的结果，而这又只能反过来更加深北大西洋集团内部的矛盾，所谓“大西洋团结”不过是空谈。
