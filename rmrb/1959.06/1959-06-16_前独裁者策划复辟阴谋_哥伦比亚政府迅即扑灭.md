Xinhua News Agency, Bogota dispatch: The Colombian government recently uncovered an anti-government conspiracy. It was discovered that the followers of former dictator Rojas Pinilla were involved in this conspiracy.

According to reports, on June 5th, Colombian authorities discovered that someone had transported explosives into the city of Bogota, attempting to blow up the city's water supply and create chaos; and were preparing to transport weapons by plane to support other anti-government elements in Santander province. The news said that the government had smashed the conspiracy, arrested many conspirators, and confiscated their weapons.

According to the Colombian progressive newspaper "Democratic Voice," due to the rising movement of the Colombian people for national independence and democratic freedom, "the most reactionary groups among the domestic reactionaries have regrouped, attempting to instigate a violent coup and lead the country back to dictatorship." The newspaper called on the people to be vigilant and crush the conspiracy of reactionary coup.

    新华社讯　波哥大消息：最近哥伦比亚政府破获了一起反政府的阴谋案。据发现，参与这一阴谋的是前独裁者罗哈斯·皮尼亚的追随者。
    据报道，哥伦比亚当局5日发现有人把炸药运入波哥大市区，企图炸毁城市输水道和制造混乱；并且准备用飞机运送武器接济桑坦德省的其他反政府分子。消息说，政府破获了这一阴谋，逮捕了许多阴谋分子，并且没收了他们的武器。
    据哥伦比亚进步报纸“民主呼声报”指出，由于哥伦比亚人民争取民族独立和民主自由的运动日益高涨，“国内反动派中最反动的集团又重新纠集起来，企图策动暴力政变，把国家重新引向独裁”。报纸号召人民警惕起来，粉碎反动政变的阴谋。
