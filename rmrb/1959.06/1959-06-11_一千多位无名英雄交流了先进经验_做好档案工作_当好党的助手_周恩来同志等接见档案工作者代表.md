Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Comrade Zhou Enlai, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrades Lin Boqu, Peng Zhen, Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Wang Jiaxiang and Huang Kecheng, Secretaries of the Central Secretariat, and Yang Shangkun, Alternate Secretary of the Central Secretariat, received all the representatives attending the National Archives and Materials Work Advanced Experience Exchange Conference this morning.

The National Archives and Materials Work Advanced Experience Exchange Conference, which lasted for ten days, closed today. Before the closing, Yang Shangkun, Alternate Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that archival work used to be relatively quiet, but in the past year there has been a great leap forward and great achievements have been made, making archival work "alive." The problem now is the need to improve and perfect it. Yang Shangkun said that the archival work of an organization is a kind of secretarial work, a service "industry," which operates under the leadership of the Party Committee in accordance with the Party's intentions. Archival workers should strive to be familiar with their work, study hard, especially modern revolutionary history and Party history, and should have a spirit of seeking truth from facts and hard work, and be unsung heroes.

During the meeting, more than a thousand representatives of archival workers from all over the country exchanged and summarized their experiences, and improved and unified their understanding of the nature, principles, and scope of archival work. In the discussion, everyone expressed that they would always follow the teachings of the Party, wholeheartedly, and be good assistants. They will further improve the level of archival work on the basis of their existing work, actively carry out utilization work, and better serve the socialist cause.

At the end of the meeting, Zeng San, Director of the State Archives Bureau, made a concluding speech. (Attached picture)

    历时十天的全国档案资料工作先进经验交流会已在今天闭幕，闭幕前，中共中央书记处候补书记、中共中央办公厅主任杨尚昆在会上讲话。他说，档案工作过去比较冷冷清清，一年来有了大跃进，取得很大成绩，把档案工作做“活”了。今后的问题是需要提高，需要健全。杨尚昆说，机关的档案工作是一种秘书工作，是服务“行业”，它在党委的领导下按照党的意图办事。档案工作者要努力熟悉业务，好好学习，特别是要学习近代革命史和党史，并且应该有实事求是、埋头苦干的精神，要做无名英雄。
    在会议期间，来自全国各地的一千多名档案工作者代表，交流和总结了经验，提高和统一了对于档案工作的性质、方针、范围等问题的认识。大家在讨论中表示，永远遵照党的教导，全心全意，当好助手，他们将在已有的工作基础上，进一步提高档案工作水平，积极开展利用工作，更好地为社会主义事业服务。
