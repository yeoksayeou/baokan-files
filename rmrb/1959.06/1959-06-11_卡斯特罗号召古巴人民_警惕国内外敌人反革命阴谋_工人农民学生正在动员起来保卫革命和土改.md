Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 9th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro, speaking last night to a group of lawyers, called on the people to be vigilant and pay close attention to the conspiracies being unfolded by enemies at home and abroad against the Cuban Revolution. He said: "They have already begun to oppose the Cuban Revolution in action, not just in words."

Castro said: "International trusts with huge capital and internal reactionaries are fanning the flames, instigating war criminals engaged in conspiratorial activities abroad, and instigating aggression against Cuba." Castro pointed out that the reason they attack land reform is because this measure is intended to recover the Cuban land that has been seized, because they attempt to maintain economic exploitation of Cuba, and they want to return to Cuba to act tyrannically, not hesitating to submerge Cuba in bloodshed once again. Castro called on the people, "Do not have illusions, and do not be deceived, because after the revolution, there are always counter-revolutionary forces active."

It is reported that armed forces last night searched the residence of a former Batista soldier in Havana and found a large number of weapons intended to be used against the government and to carry out provocative activities. Prior to this, in Santiago, the capital of Oriente Province, fourteen soldiers from Batista's old army were arrested for engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. Police found grenades and other weapons on them.

To defend the revolution and land reform, the Cuban people are mobilizing. In Pinar del Río Province, electrical workers recently organized a powerful demonstration attended by workers from various departments, expressing their support for the government's land reform plan and opposing the conspiracies of large landowners and foreign reactionaries. Peasants and students across the country have held activities and parades in support of the government and land reform. Leaders from various political parties and all walks of life held a meeting in Bauta on the 8th, calling for unity against the conspiracies of reactionaries at home and abroad.

    卡斯特罗号召古巴人民
    警惕国内外敌人反革命阴谋
    工人农民学生正在动员起来保卫革命和土改
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗昨晚对一群律师讲话时要求人民提高警惕，密切注意国内外敌人正在展开的反对古巴革命的阴谋。他说：“他们已经开始从行动上而不仅从口头上来反对古巴革命了。”
    卡斯特罗说：“拥有巨大资本的国际托辣斯和内部反动派正在煽风点火，鼓动在国外搞阴谋活动的战犯，鼓动对古巴的侵略”。卡斯特罗指出他们所以攻击土地改革，是因为这一措施要收回被霸占的古巴土地，因为他们企图维持对古巴的经济剥削，要想重回古巴作威作福，不惜使古巴再一次淹没在血泊中。卡斯特罗号召人民，“不要幻想也不要受骗，因为革命之后，总是跟着有反革命力量活动的。”
    据报道，武装部队昨晚在哈瓦那一个前巴蒂斯塔军人的住宅中搜出大批武器，这些武器是打算用来反对政府和进行挑衅活动的。在这以前，在奥连特省省会圣地亚哥有十四名巴蒂斯塔旧军队的军人因从事反革命活动而被逮捕。警察从他们身上搜出手榴弹和其它武器。
    为了保卫革命和土地改革古巴人民正在动员起来。在比那尔德里奥省，电力工人最近组织了一次有各部门的劳动者参加的强大示威，他们表示支持政府的土地改革计划，反对大庄园主和外国反动派的阴谋活动。全国各地的农民和学生纷纷举行了支持政府和土地改革的活动和游行。各政党和各阶层的领导者8日在包塔市举行集会，他们号召团结起来，反对国内外反动派的阴谋活动。
