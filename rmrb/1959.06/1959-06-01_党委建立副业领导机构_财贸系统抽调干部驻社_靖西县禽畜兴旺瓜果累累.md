    (Reported by this newspaper) Jingxi County in Guangxi Province has made remarkable progress in auxiliary production, with flourishing livestock and poultry and abundant melons and fruits.

    In more than 300 pig farms throughout Jingxi County, over 140,000 fat pigs are raised; there are more than 200 "ten thousand chicken mountains" and "ten thousand duck ponds". Nearly a hundred livestock farms and bee farms are thriving. More than 800 wineries, starch factories, brick and tile factories, lime kilns, and oil presses have been built. Star anise mountains, *Trichosanthes kirilowii* mountains, banana plantations, and *Panax notoginseng* (medicinal material) gardens are flourishing. This year, more than 2,000 auxiliary production bases throughout the county and commune members plan to raise 600,000 pigs and 4 million chickens and ducks. The income from various auxiliary industries is expected to quadruple compared to last year, with an average income of 300 yuan per person.

    Jingxi County's communes, production brigades, production teams, public canteens, and commune members have separately defined their business scopes. Larger-scale and centrally managed auxiliary industries are directly managed by the commune or brigade; smaller-scale and decentralized operations are managed by the brigade or production team; canteens mainly operate self-sufficient production, such as raising pigs, chickens, ducks, and growing vegetables; individual commune members, under the premise of not affecting collective production, can use production gaps or holidays to engage in small-scale auxiliary industries. More than 16,000 professionals are regularly managing collective auxiliary industries such as agricultural product processing, pig raising, brick and tile making, and the care of *Panax notoginseng* gardens; other tasks are arranged in conjunction with agricultural production, taking advantage of any available time.

    In accordance with the principles of adapting to local conditions and self-reliance, each commune has adopted various measures to overcome the three major hurdles of breeding livestock and poultry, feed, and epidemic prevention. Nearly a hundred inseminators have been trained, and artificial insemination, double mating, and artificial incubation have been widely promoted, strengthening the care of young poultry and livestock to ensure strong sows and fat piglets, with more births and more raising. Using substitute feed as the main source, various localities vigorously promote silage, fermented feed, and using cow dung to feed pigs. Each auxiliary industry professional team has established epidemic prevention stations, trained more than 850 epidemic prevention personnel, and comprehensively carried out preventive inoculation work.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of auxiliary production, the Jingxi County Party Committee and the Party Committees of each commune have established specialized auxiliary production leading bodies, appointing a secretary or committee member to take charge, and equipped them with more than 700 full-time cadres to strengthen the backbone forces on the auxiliary production front. In addition, the county's finance and trade system has also transferred more than 100 cadres to directly participate in production, organize production, and guide production in the communes, vigorously imparting technology, doing a good job in purchase and sales contracts, which has played a significant role in promoting the development of auxiliary production.

    党委建立副业领导机构　财贸系统抽调干部驻社
    靖西县禽畜兴旺瓜果累累
    本报讯　广西靖西县副业生产有声有色，畜禽兴旺，瓜果累累。
    靖西全县三百多个养猪场里，饲养着十四万多头肥猪；有二百多个万鸡山和万鸭滩。近百个畜牧场和养蜂场，蒸蒸日上。制酒、淀粉、砖瓦、石灰和榨油厂已建成八百多个。八角（大茴香）山、瓜蒌山、香蕉园和田七（药材）园一片繁茂。全县两千多个副业基点和各公社社员，今年计划养猪六十万头，鸡鸭四百万只。各项副业收入要求比去年翻两番，平均每人收入三百元。
    靖西县公社、生产大队、生产队、公共食堂和社员分别划分经营范围，对规模较大和宜于集中管理的副业，由公社或大队直接经营；规模小，宜于分散经营的，则由大队或生产队经营；食堂主要经营自给性生产，如养猪、养鸡鸭、种菜等；社员个人在不影响集体生产的前提下，可利用生产空隙或假日，经营些小宗副业。对农产品加工、养猪、烧制砖瓦、田七园的护理等集体经营的副业，由一万六千多名专业人员经常管理；其他各项则采取见缝插针的方法，结合农业生产进行具体安排。
    各公社根据因地制宜和自力更生的原则，采用多种措施攻破了种畜种禽繁殖、饲料和防疫等三个大关。训练了近百名配种员，普遍推行人工授精、双重配种和人工孵化，加强幼禽幼畜护理，做到母猪壮子肥，多生多养。各地以代用饲料为主，大力推广青贮饲料、发酵饲料和牛粪喂猪。各副业专业队都建立了防疫站，训练防疫人员八百五十多名，全面开展预防注射工作。
    为了加强对副业生产的领导，中共靖西县委和各公社党委，都成立了专门副业领导机构，确定一个书记或委员挂帅，并配备了七百多名专职干部，充实副业战线骨干力量。此外，全县财贸系统也抽调了一百多名干部，直接到公社参加生产，组织生产，指导生产，并大力传授技术，做好包购包销工作，对副业生产的发展起了显著推动作用。
