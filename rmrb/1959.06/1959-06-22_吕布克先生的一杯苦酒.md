Mr. Heinrich Lübke, 64, is the West German Minister of Agriculture who is "unpopular among farmers." Due to the continuous rise in milk and vegetable prices, West German residents have also been constantly complaining and deeply dissatisfied with this minister. It is said that two years ago, some people even demanded that the government dismiss him. But a few days ago, Mr. Lübke suddenly "had good luck" and was nominated by the leading body of his party, the Christian Democratic Union, as a candidate for President of West Germany.

From an agricultural minister who only manages wheat, potatoes, and vegetables to a presidential candidate. This kind of "meteoric rise" may be worthy of celebration in the eyes of some people. But not for Mr. Heinrich Lübke. After being "unexpectedly" elected as a presidential candidate, he said with a frown: "This change is very difficult for me. I don't think I am suitable for this very high position. I have to force myself to cope with this job." In Mr. Lübke's view, accepting this decision of the leading body of the Christian Democratic Union is as difficult as drinking a bitter cup of unpleasant wine. He unreservedly stated, "I would not feel regretful if this cup was not meant for me to drink."

Why does Mr. Lübke have to reluctantly take this bitter cup? The reason must be sought in the origin of this bitter cup.

The nominal position of West German presidential candidate has been kicked around in Adenauer's party like a soccer ball in a game for the past few months. Adenauer originally wanted to kick this ball to his rival in the party, Vice Chancellor and Minister of Economic Affairs Erhard. But Erhard, who has been coveting the position of Prime Minister, has no interest in it and has kicked it back several times. On April 7 this year, at a meeting of the leading body of the Christian Democratic Union, Adenauer was forced to announce his abandonment of the position of Prime Minister to become a West German presidential candidate. However, this "Cold War knight" who has always held power alone for several years is unwilling to become a mere ornament in West German political life before his "ambition" to rearm West Germany has been fulfilled. For two months, he has been trying to amend the constitution to expand the power of the president and let his confidant, Finance Minister Etzel, inherit his mantle. But his wishful thinking has failed due to a lack of support. Finally, on June 5, he brazenly announced to his party: "I am determined to continue to serve as Prime Minister." The reason is: due to the holding of the Geneva Conference, "the international situation has deteriorated." "If I leave my post at this critical moment, it will not have a good impact at home and abroad."

Adenauer's capricious decision caused an explosive reaction in West Germany. Accusations, curses, and cold sarcasm immediately fell on him like a storm. The Social Democratic Party said, "Such a practice of playing with people and disrespecting people can only be found in dictators." The chairman of the Free Democratic Party, Maier, accused it of "almost intolerably degrading" the position of president. The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" simply said, "Due to his capriciousness, his own prestige has also entered the grave." Even within his own party, the support Adenauer received was reluctant. The vice-chairman of the party, Gerstenmaier, said: "None of the reasons given by Adenauer is convincing."

But Adenauer didn't care about the attacks from all sides. The West German newspaper "Die Welt" wrote that others' opposition "is of no interest to him, he only needs to know what he wants." According to Western newspapers, Adenauer's backbone is so strong because of the support of his American bosses. When Adenauer went to the United States at the end of May to attend Dulles' funeral, Eisenhower expressed "regret" to him in person, because he heard that he would "soon be leaving actual political life." At the same time, there was also a legend circulating in Washington: one of Dulles' "last wishes was that as long as Dr. Adenauer is alive, the choice of prime minister should remain unchanged." Therefore, when Adenauer did not disappoint and announced his decision to continue clinging to his position, the Associated Press hurriedly reported that American leaders believed that Adenauer was "a reliable and true ally of the United States in the global struggle against international communism."

Adenauer's decision was a heavy blow to his opponent Erhard. Erhard did not expect that when he was visiting the United States "as a possible future prime minister" to "introduce himself," Adenauer would make such a move. He immediately issued a statement in Washington saying that Adenauer's decision was "regrettable" and firmly stated that he would not be a presidential candidate. On June 9, he rushed back to West Germany from the United States and said that "the issue of the prime minister's position can only be considered in accordance with the provisions of the constitution," and that "he will demand a frank debate on this issue and make the situation public to the German public." The implication is that he will have a final showdown with Adenauer within the party. But this hidden serious struggle caused unease across the Atlantic. On the very day that Erhard returned home ahead of schedule, the Associated Press sent a message from Washington saying that American "responsible authorities frankly expressed concern that the Erhard-Adenauer conflict might split the German Christian Democratic Party" and hoped that they would "quickly consolidate their ranks in order to make up for the differences afterward." With American pressure from the outside and the opposition party preparing to take the opportunity to rise from within, the leaders of the Christian Democratic Union finally adopted a method of reconciliation and compromise in order to temporarily overcome the current crisis. They finally agreed to Adenauer's continued tenure.

However, the position of presidential candidate is still vacant. This position is like a chicken rib, "tasteless to eat, but a pity to discard." Of course, it cannot be taken by the opposition party. So Adenauer's party reconvened on June 15 to discuss the nomination. At first, they wanted to push Speaker Gerstenmaier and party executive chairman Krone to take the position, but both of them had no intention of doing so. After pushing back and forth, they pushed it to the little-known Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Lübke. Although he is unpopular and has no great talent, he was originally brought out as a display. Mr. Lübke also has a good understanding of himself. He said, "They could have chosen more suitable people, but they probably found it easier to agree to have me as a candidate."

Now Adenauer's party's presidential candidate "soccer game" has come to an end because Mr. Lübke has come out to fill the vacancy. But the struggle between Adenauer and Erhard for the position of Prime Minister has not been fundamentally eliminated. The Associated Press recently revealed that "the various issues over which they are in dispute have not been resolved." The West German "Sonntagszeitung" also said that "observers believe that the victory of the 83-year-old man is only a rest in the dramatic struggle, and the play is not over yet." Yes, the play is not over, and the good show is yet to come!

    吕布克先生的一杯苦酒
    陈有为
    六十四岁的海因里希·吕布克先生，是在“农民中间……不得人心”的西德农业部长。由于牛奶和蔬菜价格的不断上涨，西德居民对这位部长先生也一直啧有怨言，深为不满。据说前两年还曾有人要求政府把他撤职。但是几天以前，吕布克先生忽然“时运亨通”起来，被他自己的党——基督教民主联盟的领导机构推选为西德的总统候选人。
    从一个只管管小麦、土豆和蔬菜的农业部长，一跃而为堂堂总统的候选人。这种“平地青云”的“飞黄腾达”，在有些人看来也许是值得额手称庆的。但是海因里希·吕布克先生却不然。他在“意外地”当选总统候选人以后愁眉苦脸地说：“这一更动对我来说是很难办的。我不认为，我是适合于担任这个非常高级的职位的。我必须强迫我自己去应付这个工作。”在吕布克先生看来，接受基督教民主联盟领导机构的这个决定，简直是跟喝一杯涩口的苦酒一样难受。他不加掩饰地表示，“假如这杯酒不该我来喝，我也不会感到遗憾的。”
    为什么吕布克先生定要勉为其难地呷下这杯苦酒呢？这要从这杯苦酒的来历中去找原因。
    西德总统候选人这个有名无实的职位，最近几个月来就像一场球赛中的足球一样，在阿登纳的党内一会儿踢过来，一会儿又踢过去。阿登纳原想把这个球踢给他在党内的劲敌、副总理兼经济部长艾哈德。但一直在觊觎总理职位的艾哈德对它没有兴趣，几次都踢了回去。今年4月7日，在基督教民主联盟领导机构的一次会议上，阿登纳被迫宣布放弃总理职位而充当西德总统候选人。但是这个几年来始终独揽大权的“冷战骑士”，又不甘心在重新武装西德的“壮志未酬”之前，就变成西德政治生活中的一个点缀品。两个月来，他力图修改宪法以扩大总统权力和让他的心腹、财政部长埃策尔来继承他的衣钵。但他的如意算盘因为支持乏人而都落空了。终于，在6月5日，他悍然不顾一切地对自己的党宣布：“我坚决要继续担任总理”。理由是：由于日内瓦会议的举行，“国际局势已经恶化了”。“要是我在这个紧要关头离职，这对国内外都不会有好影响。”
    阿登纳这个反复无常的决定，在西德引起了爆炸性的反映。指责、咒骂和冷讽热嘲立即像暴雨般地落到他的身上。社会民主党说“这样一种玩弄人、不尊重人的作法只有在独裁者那里才能找到”。自由民主党主席迈尔指责这是“几乎难以容忍地贬低”总统的职务。“法兰克福评论报”干脆说，“由于他的反复无常，他自己的威望也进了坟墓。”就是在他自己的党内，阿登纳得到的支持也是勉强的。党的副主席格斯登美尔说：“阿登纳举出的理由中没有一个是令人信服的”。
    但阿登纳对来自各方面的攻击满不在乎。西德“世界报”写道，别人的反对“对他来说并无兴趣，他只要知道他所想的是什么就够了”。据西方报刊透露，阿登纳的腰杆子所以这么硬，是因为美国后台老板在撑着他。当阿登纳在5月底到美国去参加杜勒斯葬礼时，艾森豪威尔曾当面向他表示“遗憾”，因为听说他“不久将脱离实际政治生涯”了。同时，在华盛顿还流行着一种传说：杜勒斯“临终的遗志之一是，只要阿登纳博士在世一日，总理人选就应该一日不变。”因此，当阿登纳果然不负所望而宣布继续恋栈的决定时，美联社就急忙报道说，美国领袖们认为阿登纳是“美国在反对国际共产主义的全球斗争中的一个可信赖的真正盟友”。
    阿登纳的决定对于他的对手艾哈德来说是一个沉重的打击。艾哈德料想不到，当他“正在以一种未来可能的总理的身份”访问美国“进行自我介绍”的时候，阿登纳会来这么一招。他立即在华盛顿发表谈话说，阿登纳的这个决定是“令人遗憾的”，并坚决表示不当总统候选人。6月9日，他从美国匆匆赶回西德，又说“总理的职位问题只能根据宪法的规定来考虑”，“他将要求坦率地辩论这一问题，并把情况公之于德国的公众”。言下之意是，还要在党内跟阿登纳决一雌雄。但是这场隐伏着的严重斗争却引起了大西洋彼岸的不安。就在艾哈德提前回国的那一天，美联社从华盛顿传出消息说，美国“负责当局人士直率地表示忧虑，担心艾哈德—阿登纳的冲突可能会分裂德国基督教民主党”，希望他们“迅速地巩固队伍以便事后弥补分歧”。在外有美国压力，内有反对党准备伺机而起的情况之下，基督教民主联盟的那些头头们，为了暂时度过目前的危机，终于采取了和解妥协的办法。他们最后同意了阿登纳继续留任。
    但是总统候选人这个职位却仍然悬空着。这个职位就像鸡肋一样，“食之无味，弃之可惜”。当然也不能让反对党拿去。于是阿登纳的党又在6月15日重新开会讨论提名。起先是想推议长格斯登美尔和党的执行主席克罗内来担任，但他们两人都无意于此。推来推去，就推到了那位名不见经传的农业部长吕布克先生身上。虽然他不得人心，也无雄才大略，本来是捧出来摆摆样子的。吕布克先生也很有自知之明。他说，“他们本来能挑选更为合适的人，但是他们大概比较容易同意由我来当候选人。”
    现在阿登纳党内这一场总统候选人的“足球赛”，已经因吕布克先生出来顶缺而告终了。但是阿登纳跟艾哈德之间争夺总理职位的斗争却并未根本消除。美联社最近透露，他们两人之间“有所争执的各项问题都没有解决”。西德的“星期日世界报”也说，“观察家认为，八十三岁老人的胜利仅仅是戏剧性的斗争中的一个休息而已，这场戏还未完。”是的，戏还没有完，好戏还在后头哩！
