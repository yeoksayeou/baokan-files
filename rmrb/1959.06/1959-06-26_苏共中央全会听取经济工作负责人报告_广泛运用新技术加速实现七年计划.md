Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th (TASS): At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which opened on the 24th, reports were heard from the chairmen of the National Economic Councils of various regions of the Soviet Union and the chairman of the State Chemistry Committee.

    Petukhov, chairman of the Moscow City National Economic Council, listed in his report materials on the technological equipment renovation of Moscow's industry. Last year, Moscow factories installed 142 automated and mechanized assembly lines and approximately 1,800 automated machine tools, updated a large amount of equipment to meet modern requirements, and adopted various lifting and transport equipment.

    More than 300,000 people participated in the formulation of the automation and mechanization plan for technological processes.

    The reporter said that after fulfilling their pledges, the employees of Moscow's enterprises put forward new pledges: that the output in 1965 would increase by more than 50% compared to the output stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan for that year. They stipulated completing the Seven-Year Plan for total output ahead of schedule and drafted a plan to broadly develop the machine tool manufacturing industry, in which the production of special machine tools would increase by 1.1 times and the production of precision machine tools for the final process of technological processes would increase by 1.3 times in 1965.

    Petukhov said that Moscow's enterprises would manufacture approximately 7,000 types of machines, equipment, and instruments for the technological equipment renovation of industry. The National Economic Council plans to completely renovate the main products during the Seven-Year Plan period. This year, 700 new types of machines and instruments will be produced.

    Afanasyev, chairman of the Leningrad National Economic Council, said that the policy of using investment to rebuild enterprises was, and still is, the established policy for developing the industry of the Leningrad economic zone.

    He said that the working people of Leningrad guaranteed to reach the production level, labor productivity, and technical level of products stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan within six years. He pointed out that the experience of industrial work in the past two years fully confirmed that the Party's decision on reorganizing the management of industry and construction was correct.

    Afanasyev pointed out that Leningrad's industry had reached the technical level of Europe in the production of steam turbines, but was still slightly behind the United States. Now, Leningrad is about to complete the design of steam turbines with a power generation capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, and is creating turbines with 400,000, 500,000, and 600,000 kilowatts using high-parameter and ultra-high-parameter steam. This will eliminate the situation where turbines are slightly inferior to the United States in terms of power generation capacity and parameters.

    In the next seven years, a large amount of work will be carried out in the production of gas turbines, and a unique gas turbine unit with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts will be manufactured. Afanasyev said that generators with a power generation capacity of 300,000 kilowatts equipped with water-cooled stators and rotors are now being designed. He said that manufacturing this type of generator would make the Soviet Union's power machinery manufacturing industry occupy a leading position in the world's technical field.

    Gyadyk, chairman of the Stalino National Economic Council, said in his report that the labor productivity of enterprises in the Stalino (Ukraine) economic zone would increase by 55.8% within seven years, and the output would increase by 56.3%. He added that this growth would be guaranteed by the overall mechanization and automation of production. Gyadyk emphasized that there was no doubt that the enterprises of the National Economic Council would complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    Gyadyk said that Donbass planned to rebuild the existing 35 mines during the period of 1959-1965, guaranteeing an increase of more than 13 million tons in annual coal production.

    The reporter pointed out that in recent years, the Donbass metallurgical industry had done a lot of work in the mechanization and automation of production. The Stalino Metallurgical Plant is about to complete the construction of the world's largest continuous steel casting device, which is equipped with the latest equipment controlled by mechanization and television. This year, many factories will complete the work of gasifying furnace production. The "Azov Steel Plant" plans to initially produce pig iron for open-hearth furnace smelting by the end of 1959, using the method of blowing pig iron in a bucket of steam and oxygen mixture. The speaker said that this method was first realized in Soviet metallurgical practice.

    Gyadyk continued that the machine-building workers of the Stalino National Economic Council would increase their output by 70% in the next seven years.

    Stepanov, chairman of the Sverdlovsk National Economic Council, said that the supplementary guarantees put forward by the working people of the Sverdlovsk Oblast were all for the task of successfully winning the most time in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism.

    The reporter said that based on the widespread application of new technologies and the growth of labor productivity, all employees of the National Economic Council's industrial enterprises decided to complete the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    Stepanov pointed out that in the seven years, the Urals would maintain a leading position in the Russian Federation in the production of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as in the products of the heavy machinery manufacturing industry. Non-ferrous metallurgy is one of the main industrial sectors in the Sverdlovsk economic zone. The continued growth of non-ferrous metal production will mainly rely on the mechanization and automation of technological processes.

    Tikhonov, chairman of the Dnepropetrovsk National Economic Council, made a report at the evening meeting. He said that the mining indicators achieved by the miners in the Krivoy Rog iron ore area exceeded the US iron ore indicators by about one time. There are three ore layers being mined simultaneously here, sometimes even four ore layers, while in world mining practice, it is generally one or two ore layers.

    Tikhonov said that the mines in the Krivoy Rog mining area had obtained many new and high-productivity machines and equipment in recent years. This has increased the driving speed of horizontal shafts by one time compared to 1956, and increased the driving speed of mine shafts by two times.

    Tikhonov continued that more economical drilling machines are now being prepared for continuous production, and the production of new types of thermal drilling machines has been mastered, which increases productivity by four to five times. Powerful loading and unloading machines have also been created, shortening the ore dressing time by one-half to two-thirds.

    Tikhonov emphasized that the use of natural gas in steel production is of great significance. He said that the working experience of a blast furnace in the Dzerzhinsky Plant is worthy of special attention. This blast furnace uses natural gas and oxygen blast together.

    The reporter said that the employees of the Dnepropetrovsk National Economic Council decided that, without additional investment, they would reach the mining level, as well as the production level of pig iron, steel, steel products, steel pipes, and coking coal stipulated at the end of the Seven-Year Plan (1965) two years ahead of schedule.

    Fyodorov, chairman of the State Chemistry Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, emphasized in his report to the CPSU Central Committee that some famous resolutions of the Party and the government were turning points in the development of the motherland's chemical industry. He pointed out that in order to implement these resolutions, chemical industrial enterprises completed 104% of the total output value plan in 1958, making its production 13% higher than in 1957.

    The reporter pointed out that last year, the progress of construction and reconstruction projects of chemical enterprises was greatly accelerated. Ukraine and many states of the Russian Federation have achieved great results in this regard.

    The reporter pointed out that Soviet machine manufacturing enterprises increased the output of chemical industrial equipment. The scientific research and design base of the chemical industry has been expanded. Nine scientific research institutes and eleven branches have been established in the system of the Soviet State Chemistry Committee and the Soviet Academy of Sciences. A total of about 150 scientific research institutes and a large number of laboratories participated in the theoretical research work on obtaining new polymer materials. The reporter emphasized that the rapid development of scientific research work and the timely provision of technical data formulated on the basis of the latest achievements in chemical science for construction projects are of great significance for the victorious completion of the resolution of the May 1958 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee.

    Fyodorov finally emphasized the great role of the cooperation between Soviet chemical scientists and chemical scientists from other socialist countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee continued to be held in the Great Kremlin Palace on the 25th.

    The meeting on the morning of the 25th heard a report by Kosygin, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, on measures to further develop the Soviet textile industry.

    Those who spoke in the discussion included Paton, director of the Electric Welding Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, and Afremov, First Secretary of the Gorky Oblast (Volga River Basin) Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    苏共中央全会听取经济工作负责人报告
    广泛运用新技术加速实现七年计划
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：在24日开幕的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议，听取了苏联各地国民经济委员会主席和国家化学委员会主席的报告。
    莫斯科市国民经济委员会主席佩图霍夫在报告中列举了关于莫斯科工业技术设备革新的材料。去年莫斯科各工厂安装了一百四十二部自动化和机械化的流水作业线和大约一千八百台自动化机床，更新了大量的设备，使之符合现代化要求，并且采用了各种起重运输设备。
    有三十多万人参加了工艺规程自动化和机械化计划的制订工作。
    报告人说，莫斯科各企业的职工在实现他们的保证后，又提出新的保证：1965年的产品产量要比七年计划所规定的这一年的产量增加50％以上，规定了提前完成七年总产量计划，拟定了广泛地发展机床制造业计划，其中在1965年特种机床的生产增加一点一倍，工艺规程最后工序用的精密机床的生产增加一点三倍。
    佩图霍夫说，莫斯科各企业将为工业的技术设备革新制造大约七千种机器、设备和仪器。国民经济委员会拟定在七年计划期间把主要产品全部革新。今年将生产七百种新型机器和仪器。
    列宁格勒国民经济委员会主席阿法纳西耶夫说，利用投资来改建企业的方针，过去是，现在仍然是发展列宁格勒经济区工业的既定方针。
    他说，列宁格勒劳动人民保证在六年内达到七年计划所规定的生产水平、劳动生产率和产品的技术水平。他指出，两年来工业工作的经验完全证实了党关于改组工业和建筑业管理的决定是正确的。
    阿法纳西耶夫指出，列宁格勒的工业在蒸汽涡轮机的生产方面达到了欧洲的技术水平，但是还稍稍落后于美国。现在，列宁格勒即将完成发电能力为三十万瓩的蒸汽涡轮机的设计，并且正在创造四十万瓩、五十万瓩和六十万瓩不等的、使用高参数和超高参数蒸汽的涡轮机，这样一来，涡轮机在发电能力和参数方面略逊于美国的状态将会消除。
    今后七年中，将在生产瓦斯涡轮机方面进行大量的工作，将制造发电能力为十万瓩的独一无二的瓦斯涡轮装置。阿法纳西耶夫说，现在正在设计发电能力为三十万瓩、装有用水冷却的定子和转子的发电机。他说，制造这种发电机将使苏联的动力机器制造业在世界技术领域内居于主导地位。
    斯大林诺国民经济委员会主席佳迪克在报告中说，斯大林诺（乌克兰）经济区各企业的劳动生产率在七年之内将增长55.8％，产量增加56.3％。他补充道，这种增长将依靠生产全盘机械化和自动化来保证。佳迪克强调指出，无庸置疑，国民经济委员会各企业将提前完成七年计划。
    佳迪克说，顿巴斯拟定在1959—1965年期间改建现有的三十五个矿井，保证每年的采煤量增加一千三百万吨以上。
    报告人指出，最近几年来，顿巴斯冶金业在生产机械化和自动化方面做了许多工作。斯大林冶金工厂即将完成世界上最大的连续浇铸钢的装置的建设工程，这个装置是用机械化和电视控制的最新设备装置起来的。今年许多工厂将完成熔炉生产煤气化的工作。“亚速钢铁工厂”拟于1959年底初步生产平炉熔炼用的生铁，办法是把生铁放在蒸汽和氧气混合物的桶内吹炼。发言人说，这种方法是最先在苏联冶金实践中实现的。
    佳迪克继续说，斯大林诺国民经济委员会的机器制造工人在今后七年内要将产量增加70％。
    斯维德洛夫斯克国民经济委员会主席斯捷潘诺夫说，斯维德洛夫斯克州劳动人民所提出的补充保证都是为了要顺利地完成在同资本主义和平经济竞赛中最大地赢得时间的任务。
    报告人说，在广泛运用新技术和劳动生产率增长的基础上，国民经济委员会工业企业的全体职工决定提前完成七年计划的任务。
    斯捷潘诺夫指出，七年中，乌拉尔在生产黑色金属和有色金属方面，以及在重型机器制造业的产品方面，将在俄罗斯联邦中保持主导地位。有色冶金业是斯维德洛夫斯克经济区主要工业部门之一。有色金属产量的继续增长，主要将靠工艺过程的机械化和自动化。
    第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克国民经济委员会主席吉洪诺夫在晚间会议上做了报告。他说，克里沃罗格铁矿区矿工所达到的开采指标，超过美国铁矿指标大约一倍。这里同时进行开采的有三个矿层，有时甚至四个矿层，而在世界矿业实践中一般是一两个矿层。
    吉洪诺夫说，克里沃罗格矿区的矿井在最近几年中获得了许多新的生产率高的机器和设备。这就使平巷的掘进速度比1956年增加了一倍，使井筒的掘进速度增加两倍。
    吉洪诺夫接着说，现在准备连续生产更经济的钻探机器，并且掌握了新型火力钻探机床的生产，这种机床把生产率提高了四、五倍。还创造了强大的装卸机器，使选矿的时间缩短二分之一至三分之二。
    吉洪诺夫强调指出，在钢铁生产中采用天然瓦斯有很大意义。他说，捷尔任斯基工厂一个高炉的工作经验是值得特别注意的。这个高炉，把天然瓦斯和氧气鼓风并用。
    报告人说，第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克国民经济委员会各企业员工决定，在不追加投资的情况下，他们将提前两年达到规定在七年计划终了时（1965年）所要达到的采矿水平，以及生铁、钢、钢材、钢管和焦煤的生产水平。
    苏联部长会议国家化学委员会主席费奥多罗夫在苏共中央全会上所作的报告中着重指出，党和政府一些著名的决议是祖国化学工业发展中的转折点。他指出，为了实现这些决议，化学工业企业1958年完成了产品总产量计划的104％，使它的生产比1957年提高了13％。
    报告人指出，去年，化学企业的建设和重建工程的进展大大加快了。乌克兰以及俄罗斯联邦许多州在这方面取得了巨大的成绩。
    报告人指出，苏联机器制造企业提高了化学工业装备的产量。化学工业科学研究和设计基地扩大了。在苏联国家化学委员会和苏联科学院系统中建立了九个科学研究所和十一个分所。总共约有一百五十个科学研究所和大量的实验室参加了有关获得新聚合材料的理论研究工作。报告人着重指出，迅速发展科学研究工作和及时为建筑工程提供在化学科学最新成就的基础上拟订出来的技术资料，这对胜利地完成苏共中央1958年五月全会的决议有着巨大的意义。
    费奥多罗夫最后着重指出了苏联化学科学家和其他社会主义国家化学科学家实行协作的重大作用。
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏共中央全会25日继续在大克里姆林宫举行。
    25日上午的会议听取了苏联部长会议副主席、苏联国家计划委员会主席柯西金关于进一步发展苏联纺织工业的措施的报告。
    在讨论中发言的有乌克兰科学院电焊研究所所长帕顿，苏联共产党高尔基州（伏尔加河流域）委员会第一书记阿弗列莫夫等人。
