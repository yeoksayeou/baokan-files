    Temple Fair by the Qinhuai River
    By Our Reporter Zhou Xichen

    The usually deserted Madao Street, by the Qinhuai River, suddenly became lively this day. The mobile scrap metal recycling "temple fair" organized here by the Qinhuai District of Nanjing City aroused great interest among the people.

    The courtyard of the Kangle Nursery was temporarily transformed into the "open-air theater" of the "temple fair." At the foot of the western wall, a smooth platform about three feet high was crowded with spectators, all intently watching the program being performed on the stage: "Granny Wang Sells Scrap."

    Granny Wang asks the scrap collector, Old Hu, about the uses of various scraps. She sings in the Xiju opera style that people love:

    "First I ask about broken shoe soles, second I ask about rotten burlap sacks,
    Third I ask about old newspapers, fourth I ask about waste rubber.
    What are scrap copper and mixed copper used for? What things use plastic?
    What is hair residue for? What raw materials can fish scales be made into?"

    Old Hu, carrying a high basket (a carrying pole for collecting scrap), also sings in the same tune:

    "Broken shoe soles can make paper, burlap sacks can be used to reproduce rope,
    Waste newspapers are used for packaging, waste rubber can also make recycled rubber.
    Copper wire, copper skin, and broken copper can be made into things, toothbrushes and soap boxes use plastic,
    Hair residue is used to make medicine, fish scales can be refined into fish scale glue."

    Seeing that Old Hu answered fluently and logically, Granny Wang couldn't help but nod frequently, her face full of smiles. After a slight pause, she sang again:

    "What can rotten cotton be used for? What materials can animal bones be made into?
    What are cigarette butts used for? Do you want broken glass?"

    Without thinking, Old Hu sang again:

    "Rotten cotton spinning can be bleached, animal bones can be rendered into oil as raw materials,
    Cigarette butts make insecticide, broken glass can be recycled."

    Afterwards, Granny Wang sold the scrap from her home. Seeing this, the audience showed satisfied smiles. They were satisfied with the earnest and enthusiastic performance of the "actors," and even more satisfied with "Granny Wang's" active behavior of selling scrap.

    These "actors" were all on stage for the first time, and the programs, from writing and arranging to makeup, were all done by themselves. In terms of acting skills, of course, they cannot be compared with the big theater troupes, but their enthusiasm for serving work and the people is very valuable.

    In the "exhibition hall" at the entrance of the courtyard, a huge "treasure basin" stood out in the center. This "treasure" basin was filled with various "treasures": scrap copper, scrap iron, old cloth strips, rotten cotton, and so on. Some people may laugh and say: what kind of treasure is this? Old cloth strips and rotten cotton are things that every family has some of: Yes, the "treasure" in "treasure" is exactly "that every family has some."

    On the wall of the "exhibition hall," a large red honor roll was posted, and the most eye-catching on the list was the glorious deeds of an old lady: because she actively sold a large amount of waste copper and tinware.

    On the street outside the courtyard, a long line of stalls and several mobile trucks were surrounded by crowds. The stalls and trucks were filled with various small commodities, mountain goods, porcelain, flower mats, and children's supplies, truly everything. In just over a day, more than seven hundred banana leaf fans and more than one thousand fly swatters were sold, and soap, kitchen knives, iron spoons, pot shovels, etc., were restocked several times and sold out. In addition to small commodities, mountain goods, porcelain, flower mats, and other categories of goods alone recovered more than 600 yuan in cash.

    Next to the goods stalls, dozens of high baskets were lined up along the wall. The purchasing agents warmly received the crowd who came to "offer treasures" at the edge of the baskets. Today, their "business" was the most prosperous. Look, they were all busy, their faces flushed, and sweat dripping down their shoulders.

    The first to come to the "fair" this day was Lu Dama, a nationally renowned sanitation model. She led a large group of people to the "temple fair" happily with gongs and drums, each holding various scraps in their hands. It turned out that Lu Dama had heard that a "temple fair" was going to be held in Madao Street, so she had prepared a few days in advance. She gathered all the copper foot stoves, broken glass, etc. that she didn't need at home, ready to go to the "fair." This time, Lu Dama was selling scrap for the third time. The three times totaled more than ten yuan, and she used the money to buy a shirt for her eldest daughter-in-law, a shirt for her youngest daughter, a undershirt and a pair of small shoes for her grandson, and a straw hat for herself and her grandson. She also bought a teacup, two banana leaf fans, two bars of medicinal soap, and an earthenware pot. Lu Dama planned to save the remaining money to pay tuition for her youngest daughter who was studying at a girls' middle school. After selling the scrap and buying back so many things, the whole family was extremely happy. Dama said: "Exchanging scrap for practical things is good for production and good for life."

    The mobile "temple fair" form created by the Qinhuai District, which combines literary and artistic propaganda, material supply, and scrap recycling, is not only attractive to the masses and has a profound impact, but also has good results. In the four "temple fairs" in Confucius Temple, Shuangleyuan, Shiba Street, and Madao Street alone, fifty-two tons of scrap were recovered. In the Nanjing City scrap recycling work evaluation, Qinhuai District was rated as the unit champion.

### 秦淮河畔的庙会

    秦淮河畔的庙会
    本报记者　周惜晨
    在秦淮河畔，一向冷寂的马道街，这一天突然变得热闹了。南京市秦淮区在这里组织的废品回收流动“庙会”引起了人们莫大的兴趣。
    康乐托儿所的大院子，临时变成了“庙会”的“露天剧场”。西墙脚下一块三尺来高的平坦的台子下挤满了观众，一个个都聚精会神地欣赏着台上演出的节目：“王大娘卖废品”。
    王大娘问废品收购员胡老二各种废品的用途。只听她用人们喜爱的锡剧腔调唱道：
    “第一问你破鞋底，第二问你烂麻包，
    第三问你旧报纸，第四问你废橡胶。
    碎铜杂铜有啥用？什么东西用塑胶？
    头发渣子做什么？鱼鳞能做啥原料？”
    胡老二挑着一副高箩（收废品用的担子），也用同样的调子唱答：
    “破烂鞋底能造纸，复制麻绳用麻包，
    废旧报纸包装用，废胶还制再生胶。
    铜丝铜皮碎铜造，牙刷皂盒用塑胶，
    头发渣子制药品，鱼鳞提炼鱼鳞胶。”
    王大娘见胡老二对答如流，条条入理，不由得频频点头，满脸带笑。只见她略一沉吟，又唱道：
    “破烂棉花做什么？牲骨能做啥材料？
    香烟屁股有啥用？零碎玻璃要不要？”
    胡老二不加思索，就又唱道：
    “烂棉纺纱能漂白，牲骨熬油做原料，
    香烟屁股杀虫药，零碎玻璃能回造。”
    随后，王大娘便把自己家里的废品卖了出来。看到这里，观众们都现出满意的笑容，他们对“演员”们认真热情的表演满意，他们更对“王大娘”积极卖废品的行为满意。
    这些“演员”都是第一次登台，演出的节目，从编、排到化装也都是他们自己动手。论演技，当然不能和大剧团相比，但是，他们为工作为人民服务的这股热情却是非常可贵的。
    在院子进口处的“展览馆”里，一只巨大的“聚宝盆”赫然蹲立在中央。这只“宝”盆里盛满了各种“宝”物：碎铜、烂铁、旧布条、烂棉花，等等。有人也许会失笑：这叫什么宝？旧布条、烂棉花谁家没有一些：是的，这“宝”字正好就是“宝”在这“谁家都有一些”。
    在“展览馆”的墙上，贴着红色的大幅光荣榜，榜上最引人注目的是一位老太太的光荣事迹：因为她积极地卖出了大量的废旧铜、锡器。
    在院子外边的街道上，一列长长的摊头和几辆流动货车被人群包围着。摊子和车子上边，摆满了各种小百货、山货、瓷器、花席和儿童用品，真是应有尽有。只一天多的时间，就卖出了巴蕉扇七百多把，苍蝇拍一千多个，肥皂、菜刀、铁勺、锅铲等，几次添货，都销售一空。除了小百货以外，仅山货、瓷器、花席等几门货就回收了现金六百多元。
    紧挨着货摊的，是几十副高箩沿着墙边一字排开。收购员们在箩边热情地接待着“献宝”的人群。今天，要数他们“生意”最兴隆。看，他们一个个都忙得满脸通红，汗珠顺着膀子向下滴。
    这一天，最先来“赶会”的是全国著名卫生模范鲁大妈。她领着一大群人敲锣打鼓兴高采烈地来到“庙会”上，每人手里都拿着各种废品。原来，鲁大妈听说要在马道街举行“庙会”，几天前就做了准备。她把家里用不着的铜脚炉、碎玻璃等统统收拾到一起，准备去“赶会”。这一次，鲁大妈是第三次出卖废品了。三次共卖得十多块钱，她用这些钱给大儿媳妇、小女儿各买一件衬衣，给外孙买一件汗衫、一双小鞋子，给自己和孙子各买一顶草帽，自己又买了一只茶杯，此外，又买了两把巴蕉扇子、两块药水肥皂、一个砂锅。剩下的钱，鲁大妈准备留给在一女中念书的小女儿缴学费。卖了废品，买回来这么多东西，合家都高兴得了不得。大妈说：“拿废品换来实用的东西，对生产、对生活都有好处。”
    秦淮区创造的这种以文艺宣传、物资供应、废品回收等互相结合的流动“庙会”形式，不仅对群众的吸引力大，影响深刻，而且效果也好。仅在夫子庙、双乐园、石坝街和马道街的四次“庙会”上，就回收了五十二吨废品。在南京市废品回收工作评比中，秦淮区被评为单位冠军。
