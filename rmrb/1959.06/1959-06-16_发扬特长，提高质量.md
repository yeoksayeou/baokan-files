    Promote Strengths, Improve Quality
    Chen Kehan
    In May, some art units in Beijing held a viewing and performance event. This performance embodied the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." The content was rich, the forms were diverse, and various opera types, troupes, and individuals expressed their strengths, resulting in a significant improvement in artistic quality. The shortcomings were that some programs were either not rigorous enough in structure, not distinct enough in rhythm, not prominent enough in character portrayal, not skillful enough in acting, or too extravagant in costumes and sets, not matching the plot and the characters’ personalities. Individual plays had formalistic problems. We believe that after the performance, continued revisions and rehearsals will achieve an even more perfect state.
    This performance proves that implementing the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of literary and art workers, promote the prosperity and development of literature and art, and meet the cultural life needs of the people.
    Our direction and purpose for literature and art are one: under the leadership of the Party, to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve socialist construction. However, the themes, forms, and styles should be diversified. With more forms, there can be free competition, mutual observation, and mutual promotion. The more forms, the more means of service, and the more possible it is to adapt to the requirements of different audiences and better serve socialism. As everyone knows, people's interests and requirements are often different. Diversifying themes, forms, and styles allows them more freedom and opportunities to choose, thereby meeting their respective needs. Just like the flowers in a garden, the more varieties of colors, fragrances, and postures there are, the more they attract visitors; and the various flowers seem to bloom more vigorously as they compete for beauty. Therefore, there should be works reflecting major themes of revolutionary struggle and construction, as well as lighthearted and joyful works depicting all aspects of people's lives (including love lives); there should be modern programs, as well as historical dramas, and historical dramas do not necessarily have to depict a certain theme; there should be dramas, as well as comedies and tragedies. If tragedies are handled well, they can also inspire people and enhance their will and belief in life and struggle; there should be large-scale works and serial dramas, as well as small-scale solo singing, solo instrumental performances, light music, excerpts, one-act plays, and so on. Artificially restricting the themes, forms, and styles of literary and artistic creation, or inappropriately emphasizing one while belittling another, will narrow the path and be harmful rather than beneficial. It should be admitted that our repertoire is not wide enough now, and we need to continue to expand, organize old programs, and create new programs. In opera, in particular, we must vigorously discover excellent traditional programs to enrich art.
    To let a hundred flowers bloom, it is necessary to maintain and promote the unique styles and strengths of each art form, opera type, troupe, and individual, fully develop one's own originality, and gradually and cautiously reform and develop on the basis of the original tradition. Every art has its own personality, that is, its unique style. One of the reasons why Chinese stage art is prosperous is the richness of opera types, and each opera type has a certain unique style. This is a precious treasure left to us by our ancestors. We must maintain and promote them. All opera types must learn from others, but learning must pay attention to one's own personality, combining learning and originality, and not unconditionally imitating others and losing one's original characteristics. Any art also has two aspects: inheritance and development. Remaining stagnant and unchanging will lead to the decline of art. Therefore, thousands of attempts and reforms and developments are needed. In the process of this attempt to innovate, various setbacks or failures are inevitable, and there is no need to be discouraged. However, like other sciences, art also has its inheritance. The development of art is naturally determined by the material living conditions of society, but once it has formed, its inheritance becomes particularly strong. Many operas from hundreds of years ago are still appreciated by the broad masses of the people today, which proves this point. This is the objective law of artistic development and cannot be arbitrarily erased. Therefore, each opera type must pay attention to maintaining and promoting its traditional foundation when reforming and developing. First of all, it should inherit the tradition and consolidate the foundation, and then gradually and selectively absorb the strengths of other arts, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, on this basis to nourish and enrich itself. The deeper the roots are, the more luxuriant the branches and leaves are, and the more they can absorb sunlight, air, and moisture. Moreover, since it is called absorbing nutrients, one must first look at one's own body and performance, choose the most suitable ingredients for nourishment, and absorb them slowly after chewing and digesting; one must never be reckless, swallowing everything raw, and ruining one's own style. The purpose of learning is to nourish and enrich oneself, so that one can be further developed and promoted. If one fundamentally abandons the original traditional foundation and loses the individuality of independent existence, how can one talk about learning from others, enriching and developing oneself? If all opera types do not pay attention to maintaining their own styles and characteristics, but learn from a certain opera type and transform themselves into the latter, then our art garden will not be a hundred flowers blooming, but one flower blooming alone. At that time, even if this flower is as beautiful as a peony, it will make people feel bored.
    In letting a hundred flowers bloom, we must also give full play to the specialties of various accomplished artists. For example, in vocal music, there are two different singing methods: folk and European; in Peking Opera, there are various different schools... They can learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, but do not force them to sing things they are not good at. On the contrary, we should pay attention to maintaining their unique styles, giving full play to their strengths, and avoiding weaknesses, so that the audience feels that each has its own merits. In order to promote their artistic talents, writers can arrange certain occasions and give appropriate consideration when writing scripts. However, it is necessary to grasp the development of the plot and character, and to be appropriate, so that the actor's activities can be truly integrated with the plot of the play. If it is too far-fetched, it will be counterproductive and cause losses to both the actor and the play.
    Let's talk about the issue of improving quality. Professional art troupes must constantly improve their artistic quality, and there is no longer any dispute among most comrades about this. The question is in what direction to improve. Premier Zhou Enlai said in his government work report at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress: "We should encourage professional writers and artists to educate the people with works of higher ideological and artistic quality through arduous efforts and meet the cultural life needs of the people." This short sentence correctly points out the purpose, significance, and method of improvement.
    The fundamental purpose of improvement is to educate the people and meet the cultural life needs of the people, that is, to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The reason why professional art troupes must constantly improve is to use works with more perfect content and form to popularize work among the people on the one hand, and to improve the people's ideological awareness, artistic accomplishment, interest, and appreciation level on the other. Leaving this fundamental purpose will lead to losing direction.
    First of all, we must improve the ideological content of the work. The content and form of the work should be unified. However, content is in the dominant aspect. If the ideological content of the work is progressive, correct, and healthy, and is expressed through a beautiful artistic form, it can play a positive role. Conversely, if the ideological content of the work is reactionary, wrong, and harmful, even if the performing arts are very superb, it is difficult to change the objective effect of the entire play, and sometimes the effect may even be counterproductive. Of course, there are also some works that do not have much progressive ideological content, but are not harmful, and have a relatively high artistic level, which can provide the masses with legitimate entertainment. Although no poisonous weeds appeared in this performance, sometimes the performance is not completely satisfactory. Careful consideration often reveals that the work itself has one or another weakness, such as: a confused theme, content that does not meet the requirements of the times, and problems with character shaping, all of which involve the ideological content of the work. Therefore, we must first focus on scripts, music, and art design. It is better to give writers and artists more time to process and modify them than to hastily put the work on stage. This is somewhat similar to the relationship between design and construction in industrial construction. Only with a good design can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in construction and ensure that the completed building is practical and beautiful. Many artistic performance groups still need to pay good attention to and work hard in this area.
    However, while improving ideological content, we must also improve artistry, using beautiful artistic forms to express progressive or beneficial content, so that the audience is attracted and infected by the charm of art, and unconsciously receives education and influence. And this influence is often more far-reaching than general political mobilization. Several musical works in this performance were deeply moving, which proves this point. Chairman Mao once said, "Artistic works that lack artistry, no matter how progressive they are politically, are powerless." Therefore, we must greatly promote art and technology, strengthen basic training, and improve literary and artistic accomplishment. It should be admitted that for many people and many groups, the technical hurdle has not yet been passed, and learning is endless. We must resolutely make up our minds, study hard, and practice diligently, and truly achieve skilled techniques and ease of use, in order to achieve something and create something in art. A purely technical viewpoint is certainly undesirable, but it is also wrong to despise and reject technology. Under the condition of politics in command, we should talk a lot about technology, and everyone should strive for excellence and strive for the top.
    Whether it is to improve ideological content or artistry, it requires arduous efforts. Artistic practice itself also proves that climbing the peak of art is not an easy task. It is necessary to have the greatest perseverance and perseverance, be down-to-earth, self-reliant, and move forward step by step. There is no shortcut to take advantage of. In this performance, many troupes, after undergoing the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, greatly changed their mental outlook, and then, on the basis of deepening into life and accumulating strength in the Great Leap Forward last year, paid the price of several months of diligent labor to achieve an inch of progress. It can be seen that improving quality cannot be rushed, but must be done gradually, accumulating continuously, and improving step by step; otherwise, violating objective laws, harming physical and mental health, will be counterproductive.
    If we lack a correct understanding of the direction and method of improving artistic quality, and do not make earnest efforts in the ideological and artistic aspects of the work, attempting to please the audience with gorgeous forms is doomed to failure. In individual plays, the theme is confused, the characters are obscure, and the tunes do not match the emotions of the drama's development, but the scenes are very luxurious, with colorful dances, bizarre costumes, and magnificent sets and props. As a result, the style of the original play is damaged, and the actors are unable to display their performance art specialties. Not only does it not help to improve, but it also ruins the art. Experience has proved that artistic work, like other revolutionary work, is fundamentally impossible without an honest attitude. Art cannot deceive people. Art relies on real skills, and to acquire skills, one must learn, learn, and learn again.

    发扬特长，提高质量
    陈克寒
    5月间，北京的一部分艺术单位举行了观摩演出。这次演出体现了党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，内容丰富，形式多样，各个剧种、剧团和个人各抒所长，在艺术质量上有了显著的提高。美中不足的地方，是某些节目，或者结构不够严谨，节奏不够鲜明，或者人物性格不够突出，演技不够纯熟，或者服饰布景过分铺张，同剧情和剧中人的性格不相称。个别的戏则存在着形式主义的毛病。我们相信，在会演以后，继续修改和排练，一定会达到更加完美的境界。
    这次会演证明：贯彻执行党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针，才能充分发挥文艺工作者的积极性、创造性，推动文学艺术的繁荣和发展，满足人民文化生活要求。
    我们文学艺术的方向和目的是一个，就是在党的领导下，为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务。但题材、形式、风格应当多样化。形式多了，就可自由竞赛，相互观摩，彼此促进。形式越多，服务的手段越多，也就有可能适应不同观众的要求，更好地为社会主义服务。大家知道，人们的兴趣和要求往往是不一样的，题材、形式和风格多样化，使他们有更多的选择的自由和机会，从而分别得到满足。正好像花园里的花卉一样，花色品种越多，各有特殊的色彩、香味和姿态，就越能吸引游人；而且各种花卉争艳斗妍，开得似乎越有精神。因此，要有反映革命斗争和建设工作的重大题材的作品，也要有描写人民的各个方面的生活（包括爱情生活在内）的轻松愉快的作品；要有现代节目，也要有历史剧目，历史剧目也不一定非要描写某一种题材不可；要有正剧，也要有喜剧、悲剧，悲剧只要处理得好，也可以激励人心，增强人们生活和斗争的意志和信念；要有大型的作品和连台本戏，也要有小型的独唱、独奏、轻音乐、折子戏、独幕剧；等等。对于文艺创作的题材、形式、风格，人为地加以限制，或者不适当地强调某一种，贬抑另一种，会使路子越走越窄，是有害无益的。应该承认：现在我们的戏路还是不够宽广的，需要继续开拓，整理旧节目，创造新节目；在戏曲方面，特别要大力发掘优秀的传统节目，以丰富艺术。
    百花齐放，就要保持和发扬各个艺种、剧种、剧团、个人的独特的风格和长处，充分发挥自己的独创性，并且在原来传统的基础上逐步地谨慎地进行改革和发展。任何艺术都有它的个性，也就是独特的风格。中国舞台艺术之所以繁荣，原因之一是剧种丰富，而且每一剧种都有一定的独特风格。这是历代祖先遗留给我们的一份宝贵财富。我们要保持和发扬它们。各个剧种，都要向别人学习，但学习必须注意自己的个性，学习和独创结合，不要无条件地模仿别人，丧失自己原有的特色。任何艺术还都有继承和发展两个方面。故步自封，一成不变，会导致艺术的衰退。因此，需要作千百种尝试，进行改革和发展，在这种尝试革新的过程中，难免会遭受种种挫折或失败，也不必因而灰心丧气。但是，同其他科学一样，艺术也有它的继承性。艺术的发展自然为社会物质生活条件所决定，但当它已经形成以后，它的承继性就特别强烈。几百年前的许多戏曲，流传至今，仍为广大人民所赞赏，就证明这点。这是艺术发展的客观规律，无法任意抹煞。所以，每个剧种在进行改革和发展的时候，必须注意保持和发扬自己的传统的基础。首先应当继承传统，巩固基础，然后在这个基础上逐步地有选择地吸收中外古今其他艺术的长处，以营养和丰富自己。根扎得越深，枝叶越茂盛，越能吸收阳光、空气和水分。而且，既然叫做吸收营养，就得先看一看自己的机体和性能如何，选择最适宜于滋补的成分，经过咀嚼和消化，慢慢地吸收；决不能不问水火，生吞活剥，败坏自己的风格。学习的目的是为了营养和丰富自己，使自己更加发扬光大起来。如果根本抛弃原有的传统基础，丧失了独立存在的个性，又怎么谈得到学习别人，丰富和发展自己呢？倘使所有剧种都不注意保持自己的风格和特色，而向某一剧种看齐，使自己转化为后者，那么我们的艺苑就将不是百花齐放，而是一花独放。那时，这一花即使艳如牡丹，也将会使人感到厌烦的吧。
    在百花齐放中，还要发挥各个有成就的艺术家的特长。例如，声乐上有民间的和欧洲的两种不同的唱法；京剧上有各种不同的流派……。他们可以互相学习，采长补短，但不要勉强他们去演唱不善长的东西，相反地却要注意保持他们的独特的风格，发挥优长，避免弱点，使观众感到各有千秋。为了发扬他们的艺术才华，作家在写作剧本时，安排某些场合，给以适当的照顾，有时是可以的。但要掌握剧情和人物性格的发展，做到恰如其分，使演员的活动真正能够同戏剧的情节揉合起来，如果过分牵强，就会弄巧成拙，使演员和戏都遭受损失。
    再谈一谈提高质量问题。专业艺术团体必须不断地提高艺术质量，这在大多数同志中间已经没有争论了。问题是向什么方向提高。周恩来总理在第二届人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中说：“我们应当鼓励专业的文学家、艺术家，经过艰苦的努力，用思想性和艺术性更高的作品来教育人民群众，满足人民群众的文化生活要求。”这短短的一句话，正确地指明了提高的目的、意义和方法。
    提高的根本目的是为了教育人民群众，满足人民文化生活要求，也就是更好地为工农兵服务。专业艺术团体所以要不断地提高，就在于以内容和形式更加完美的作品，来一方面向人民进行普及工作，另方面提高人民的思想觉悟、艺术素养、兴趣和欣赏水平。离开了这个根本目的，就会迷失方向。
    首先要提高作品的思想性。作品的内容和形式应该是统一的。但是内容处于主导方面。作品的思想内容是进步的、正确的、健康的，而又通过优美的艺术形式表现出来，就能发挥积极作用。相反地，如果作品的思想内容是反动的、错误的、有害的，即使表演艺术十分高超，也很难改变全剧的客观效果，有时效果甚至会适得其反。当然，也还有一些作品，思想内容并不怎样进步，但也没有什么毒害，而艺术水平比较高，可以使群众得到正当的娱乐。这次会演虽然没有出现毒草，但有时演出上不能令人完全满意，仔细推敲，往往是由于作品本身存在着这一种或那一种弱点，例如：主题思想混乱，内容不适应时代要求，人物塑造上有问题，这些都涉及作品的思想性。所以，首先要抓剧本、抓乐曲、抓美术设计，宁可让作家、艺术家多有一点时间加工修改，不要把作品仓卒搬上舞台。这同工业建设中的设计和施工的关系有点类似，必先设计得好，在施工时才能多快好省，并且保证大厦落成后实用、美观。许多艺术表演团体对于这一方面还需要很好地注意和努力。
    但是，在提高思想性的同时，还要提高艺术性，用优美的艺术形式，来表达进步的或有益的内容，使观众为艺术的魅力所吸引和感染，不知不觉地受到教育和影响。而这种影响，往往比一般的政治鼓动更为深远。这次有几个音乐作品感人至深，就证明这一点。毛主席曾经说过，“缺乏艺术性的艺术品，无论政治上怎样进步，也是没有力量的。”因此，必须大大地提倡艺术和技术，加强基本训练，提高文艺修养。应该承认，对于许多人、许多团体说来，目前技术关还没有过好，而且学问是没有止境的，一定要痛下决心，勤学苦练，真正做到技巧娴熟，得心应手，才能在艺术上有所成就和创造。梅兰芳同志在“穆桂英挂帅”中能够一个人演满全台，用面部表情和身段动作细腻地刻划出人物内心的变化，紧紧地吸住观众的心，决不是一朝一夕之工。单纯技术观点固然要不得，但轻视和排斥技术也是错误的。在政治挂帅的条件下，应当大讲特讲技术，人人精益求精，力争上游。
    无论是提高思想性或艺术性，都要经过艰苦的努力。艺术实践本身也证明，要攀登艺术的高峰不是轻而易举的事。必须有最大的毅力和恒心，脚踏实地，自强不息，一步一步地前进，决没有什么偷便取巧的捷径。这次会演，许多剧团都是在经过整风运动和反右派斗争，精神面貌有了很大改变以后，又在去年大跃进中深入生活，积蓄力量的基础上，付出了几个月时间勤勤恳恳地劳动的代价，才取得了一寸进展。可见，提高质量也不能操之过急，而要循序渐进，不断积累，逐步提高；否则，违反客观规律，伤害身心健康，欲速不达。
    如果我们对于提高艺术质量的方向和方法缺乏正确的认识，不在作品的思想性、艺术性上认真地下功夫，企图以华丽的形式，来讨好观众，是没有不失败的。个别的戏，主题思想混乱，人物性格晦暗，曲调同戏剧发展的感情不吻合，但是场面却十分豪华，有五光十色的舞蹈，光怪陆离的服饰，金碧辉煌的布景道具，结果损害了原剧的风格，并且使得演员无法施展表演艺术上的特长，不但无补提高，反而糟蹋了艺术。经验证明，艺术工作同其他革命工作一样，没有老实态度是根本不行的。艺术是不能骗人的。艺术要靠真本领，而要取得本领，就要学习、学习，再学习。
