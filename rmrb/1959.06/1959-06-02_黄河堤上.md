    On the Yellow River Levee

    Flood Prevention Houses on the Thousand-Li Yellow River Levee

    Flood prevention houses stand on the great levee,
    From the Mang Mountains in the west to the sea in the east,
    A post every half-mile guards the embankment.
    Behind are green trees surrounding villages,
    The fields are verdant, and dove whistles echo;
    In front, the Yellow River roars past,
    Striking the levee head-on, its tail whipping up towering waves.
    The dam cuts off the Yellow River's flow,
    The reservoir resembles a terraced staircase on the river;
    The Yellow River levee is a tree-lined road,
    Embedded by the lake, inviting you to stroll.
    Flood prevention houses are like pavilions,
    Attracting tourists to admire:
    Flocks of water birds play in the azure water,
    And the azure water is used to irrigate rice paddies.
    The tree-lined avenue stretches for a thousand li,
    Pavilions stand on the avenue!
    People think of today's flood prevention houses,
    And love even more the Yellow River's vast, rippling waves.

    Old Levee Guard

    Just when the apricot blossoms were in full bloom,
    I walked onto the Yellow River levee,
    Suddenly seeing peach blossoms blooming in my face,
    An old man was planting trees on the levee.
    I helped the old man plant the tree,
    The old man invited me to sit on the levee,
    We talked about the Yellow River and family matters,
    How energetic the old man was!
    "Every year, we fought floods with torches,
    Now, the thousand-li levee is covered with flowers!
    Every year, we sounded the alarm for flood prevention,
    Now, outside the levee is a field of good crops!
  "From a young age, I took a shovel to repair the levee,
    Who would have thought that in my old age, I would take a shovel to plant an orchard!
    From a young age, I was afraid of the Yellow River,
    Look now, we draw water to irrigate fertile fields!"
    The old man blinked and smiled:
    "The levee guard is about to change jobs!"
    I asked the old man what he would do?
  "Become a gardener on the Yellow River levee."

    The east wind blew warm and gentle,
    The peach blossoms faced the sun in the wind,
    I saw the old man's face bathed in the east wind,
    Just like the peach blossoms blooming red every day.

    黄河堤上
    吴烟痕
    防汛屋黄河大堤千里长，防汛屋立在大堤上，西自邙山东临海，半里一哨守堤防。背后绿树夹村庄，田野青青鸽哨响；屋前黄水滚滚过，头撞大堤尾摆滔天浪。拦河大坝断黄水，水库好似台阶铺河上；黄河大堤林荫道，嵌在湖边任你来游逛。防汛屋，是游亭，招引游人来观赏：群群水鸟戏碧水，又见碧水上岸喂稻秧。林荫大道千里长，游亭立在大道上！人们想起今日防汛屋，更爱万里黄河碧波漾。
    老护堤员正是杏花盛开时，我走上黄河大堤，忽见桃花迎面开，一位老人堤上把树栽。我帮老人栽下树，老人邀我堤上坐，谈起黄河叙家常，老人的精力多么旺！“年年抢险举火把，如今千里大堤开满花！年年抢险敲警钟，如今堤外一片好庄稼！
  “从小拿锹修堤防，怎想到晚年拿锹种果园！从小就怕黄河水，你看如今引水灌良田！”老人眨眨眼睛笑：“护堤员啊快转业了！”我问老人干什么？
  “黄河堤上作个园艺员。”东风吹得暖洋洋，桃花迎风向太阳，我见老人满面拂东风，恰似桃花盛开日日红。
