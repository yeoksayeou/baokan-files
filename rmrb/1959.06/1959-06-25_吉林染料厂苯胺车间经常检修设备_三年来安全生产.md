Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, June 23rd. The aniline workshop of Jilin Dyestuff Factory has strengthened the daily maintenance of its equipment. On the basis of safe production, it has completed its monthly plans every month for three years and five months since 1956.

The aniline workshop is an old workshop in the Jilin Dyestuff Factory, and its equipment is old. From the start of production in 1952 to 1955, due to the one-sided view held by some cadres and workers that "completing the plan is all that matters," insufficient attention was paid to the regular maintenance and overhaul of equipment. This led to two major mechanical equipment accidents, resulting in the suspension of production for more than half a month and significant losses. Afterwards, they learned their lesson and recognized the importance of equipment maintenance, especially in chemical plants. Therefore, they seriously placed equipment maintenance on the leadership's agenda. While focusing on production, cadres also focused on equipment maintenance. At the daily morning meeting in the workshop, in addition to studying the production situation, the equipment situation was also analyzed in detail. The workshop is equipped with a full-time cadre who inspects and organizes workers to maintain equipment daily. The entire workshop is divided into four equipment maintenance areas: reduction, nitration mixed acid, pumps, and iron powder. Each area has assigned personnel responsible for equipment maintenance, and problems are solved promptly.

This workshop implemented the principle of "prevention first, maintenance as a supplement" in equipment maintenance, performing minor repairs daily, medium repairs monthly, and major repairs annually. Small problems that can easily cause equipment accidents or damage the mechanical lifespan, such as loose screws, can be detected and resolved in time during minor repairs. Production workers and maintenance workers in the workshop cooperate closely, improving maintenance efficiency. In the past, it took a week to overhaul a reduction pot; now it only takes more than a day. The maintenance workers have formed a team according to their needs, manufacturing and repairing some parts themselves. Now, all the equipment in the workshop has two sets of spare parts.

### 吉林染料厂苯胺车间经常检修设备  三年来安全生产

    吉林染料厂苯胺车间经常检修设备
    三年来安全生产
    新华社长春23日电　吉林染料厂苯胺车间加强设备的日常维修，在安全生产的基础上，自1956年起连续三年零五个月都月月完成了计划。
    苯胺车间是吉林染料厂的一个老车间，设备旧。从1952年开工生产到1955年期间，由于有些干部和工人存在着“只要完成计划就是好汉”的片面观点，对设备的经常保养检修注意不够，曾发生两次重大机械设备事故，停止生产半个多月，损失很大。此后，他们接受了教训，认识到设备维修的重要，特别是化工厂更是如此，因此认真地把设备维修工作摆到领导日程上来。干部在抓生产的同时也抓设备维修。每天早晨的车间碰头会，除了研究生产情况，还详细分析设备情况。车间配备有一名专职干部，每天巡视检查和组织工人维修设备。全车间又划分成为还原、硝化混酸、泵、铁粉等四个设备维护检修区，每个区都固定专人负责检修维护设备，发现问题及时解决。
    这个车间在设备维修中贯彻了“预防为主，检修为辅”的方针，每天一小修，每月一中修，每年一大修。像螺丝松动等一些容易造成设备事故或损害机械寿命的小毛病，在小修中就能及时发现和解决。车间生产工人和检修工人密切合作，提高了检修效率。过去检修还原锅需要一周时间，现在只要一天多。检修工人根据需要成立了一个小组，自己制造和修复一些配件。现在，全车间所有的设备，都准备了两套修配零件。
