Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch. According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur report, Otto Baumann, a member of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, issued a statement on Adenauer's decision to remain as Prime Minister, saying that Adenauer's decision stemmed from a provocative and desperate attempt to maintain power. He emphasized that the Communist Party, the German Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, and even some representatives of the upper echelons of the Christian Democratic Union, hoped to defeat this attempt.

Baumann said that the working class and its organizations, all peace-loving people, and all wise and realistic political forces in West Germany must now unite to demand a change in Adenauer's position as Prime Minister. The negotiations already underway among parliamentarians regarding a vote of no confidence in Adenauer in the Bundestag are in line with this demand. The German Communist Party will fully support these intentions of Adenauer's opponents.

He pointed out that only a small group of notorious militarists and revanchists support Adenauer. Disregarding their growing diplomatic isolation, they are still doing their utmost to implement a foreign policy that intensifies the international situation and accelerates war preparations. They do not want to admit that the forces of peace in the world and in Germany are stronger than militarism, nor do they want to admit that the people of all countries, especially the German people, will not allow a new world war to break out.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, June 6th. Adenauer's decision to remain as West German Prime Minister and overturn his promise to run for President has aroused strong dissatisfaction among West German political figures.

The Premier of Hesse, West Germany, Zinn (Social Democrat), said today that Adenauer's decision was not only disgraceful, but also an irresponsible manipulation of state office.

Social Democratic Party Vice-Chairman Wehner also criticized Adenauer's actions at this conference. He said that this showed more clearly than before the stubbornness of one person and the arrogance of a party that had once received a lot of power from the voters in 1957.

Even leading figures in Adenauer's own Christian Democratic Union have publicly expressed dissatisfaction with Adenauer's reneging on his word. Hermann, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group in Baden-Württemberg, said that Adenauer's abandonment of his candidacy for President was a great surprise to everyone, and a burden for the party.

According to some members of the Christian Democratic Union, at the party parliamentary group meeting on the 5th, many members emphasized that Adenauer's decision damaged the party's prestige. Speakers who criticized Adenauer included Bundestag President Gerstenmaier, and parliamentarians Gradl, Müller-Hermann, Bazer, Diehl, and many others.

The Supreme Executive Committee of the Social Committee of the Christian Democratic Workers' Association also announced at a meeting held in Bonn last night: Adenauer's decision to remain as Prime Minister instead of running for President was wrong. (Attached picture)

    德共中委鲍曼发表声明
    呼吁不让阿登纳再当总理
    西德政界人士对阿登纳恋栈表示不满
    新华社7日讯　据德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央委员会委员奥托·鲍曼就阿登纳决定留任总理一事发表声明说，阿登纳的决定出于维持政权的挑衅性的和绝望的企图。他强调指出，共产党、德国社会民主党、自由民主党，甚至基督教民主联盟上层人物的一些代表，都希望使这个企图归于失败。
    鲍曼说，工人阶级和它的组织、一切爱好和平的人民、西德一切明智和现实的政治力量，目前都必须联合起来，要求更换阿登纳的总理职务。在议会人士中已经开始进行的关于联邦议院对阿登纳投不信任票的谈判，是符合这一要求的。德国共产党将全力支持阿登纳反对者的这些意向。
    他指出，支持阿登纳的只有为数不多的一批恶名昭著的军国主义分子和复仇主义者。他们不顾自己在外交上的日益孤立，还在竭尽全力执行使国际局势更加紧张的外交方针，并且加速备战活动。他们不想承认，全世界和德国的和平力量比军国主义更加强大，也不想承认各国人民，首先是德国人民，不允许爆发新的世界大战。
    新华社波恩6日电　阿登纳决定留任西德总理而推翻作总统候选人的诺言这件事，在西德政界人士中引起了强烈的不满。
    西德黑森州总理齐恩（社会民主党人）今天说，阿登纳的决定不仅是不光彩的，而且是对国家职务不负责任的玩弄。
    社会民主党副主席魏纳也在这次代表大会上批评阿登纳的作法。他说，这比已往更加清楚地表明一个人物的固执和一个曾经在1957年从选民那里得到很多权力的政党的傲慢。
    甚至阿登纳自己的基督教民主联盟的领导人物也对阿登纳的出尔反尔公开表示不满。巴登—瓦登堡州基督教民主联盟议会党团主席赫尔曼说，阿登纳放弃作总统候选人对大家来说是一个很大的意外，而对党来说则是一个负担。
    据基督教民主联盟的一些议员透露，在这个党议会党团5日的会议上，许多议员都强调，阿登纳的决定有损党的威信。发言批评阿登纳的包括联邦议院议长格斯登美尔，议员葛拉德尔、缪勒—赫尔曼、巴泽尔、迪尔等许多人。
    基督教民主工人协会社会委员会最高执行委员会昨天晚上在波恩举行的一次会议上也宣布：阿登纳决定留任总理而不作总统候选人，这是错误的。（附图片）
