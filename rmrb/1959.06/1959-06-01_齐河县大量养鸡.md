Qihar County Raises Chickens on a Large Scale

(By our newspaper) Shandong Qihar County, in order to help the masses raise chickens on a large scale, is using a method of exchanging eggs for chicks in the canteens of various production teams and in various commercial sales outlets to facilitate the masses (or signing contracts with the masses to give chickens after delivering eggs). This not only guarantees the need for breeding eggs, but also ensures that chicks are sold in a timely manner. In order to improve the hatching rate of breeding eggs, various communes mobilized the masses to retain roosters as much as possible, and called on them not to slaughter roosters. Roosters purchased by commercial departments in the market were sold at low prices to villages with more hens and fewer roosters.

While mobilizing the masses to raise chickens on a large scale, the communes in Qihar County also specifically helped chicken farmers solve the problem of feed. For example, the production teams distributed feed according to the number of chickens raised by each household, and assisted the masses in finding substitutes.

In order to strengthen the work of raising chickens, Qihar County, headed by the county head, absorbed cadres from relevant departments to organize a special office and epidemic prevention agency, and held training classes in breeding techniques. (Zhao Pu)

    齐河县大量养鸡
    本报讯　山东齐河县为了帮助群众大量养鸡，在各生产队的食堂和各商业代销点用以蛋换小鸡的办法便利群众（或和群众订立先交蛋后给鸡的合同）。这样做不仅保证了种蛋的需要，而且到达雏鸡及时售出。为提高种蛋的出鸡率，各公社动员群众尽量保留雄鸡，并号召不宰杀雄鸡，商业部门在市场上收买的雄鸡都廉价出售给雌鸡多、雄鸡少的村庄。
    齐河县各公社在发动群众大量养鸡的同时，还具体地帮助养鸡户解决饲料问题。例如，由生产队按各户养鸡多少发给饲料，以及协助群众寻找代用品等。
    为了加强养鸡的工作，齐河县以县长为首，吸收有关部门干部组织了专门办公室和防疫机构，并举办了饲养技术训练班。　（赵浦）
