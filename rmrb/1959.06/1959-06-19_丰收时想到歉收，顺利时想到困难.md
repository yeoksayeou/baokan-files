Thinking of crop failure in times of abundance, thinking of difficulties in times of success; striving for agricultural bumper harvests every year, while making full preparations for the possibility of crop failure at all times; striving for lasting peace, while maintaining a high degree of vigilance against the danger of war. This is an important way of thinking when doing work, considering problems, and making plans. The instruction issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on May 9 regarding the timely completion of the summer grain and oil procurement work contains this passage: "Whether in cities or villages, grain consumption should be forward-looking and steady, thinking of crop failure in times of abundance, and thinking of next year this year." This passage is not only important for grain work, nor is it only applicable to economic work, but it also has guiding significance for all our work.

In any work, there are both favorable and unfavorable conditions, good and bad possibilities. In our work, we must make a comprehensive and objective analysis of these conditions and possibilities. We must see both the favorable conditions and the unfavorable conditions; we must anticipate both the good possibilities and the bad possibilities. Then, through correct efforts, we can fully utilize and develop the favorable conditions, and promote the realization of good possibilities; avoid and overcome the unfavorable conditions, and prevent the bad possibilities from taking effect. This can turn unfavorable into favorable and turn failure into victory. Only seeing the favorable conditions and good possibilities easily leads to pride and complacency; only seeing the difficult conditions and bad possibilities easily leads to pessimism, disappointment, and loss of fighting spirit. Both of these one-sided views are very dangerous. Only by making a comprehensive analysis of the problem, thinking more about the difficulties when we are victorious, and thinking more about the favorable side when we encounter difficulties, can we avoid arrogance in victory and discouragement in the face of difficulties. In times of victory, we must strive to "go further on the top of a hundred-foot pole"; in times of difficulty, we must strive to "turn danger into safety" and "turn defeat into victory."

Our ancestors also understood this to some extent. For example, they said: "Misfortune is where fortune leans, and fortune is where misfortune lurks" (Lao Tzu); "The wise man's consideration must be mixed with advantages and disadvantages" (Sun Tzu); "Even if in a favorable position, one must think of harm; even if in a harmful position, one must think of benefit" (Zhang Yu); "When full, think of emptiness; when peaceful, think of danger; when safe, think of peril" (Xun Zi). Although they understood to varying degrees the dialectical relationship of mutual opposition and mutual transformation between "benefit" and "harm," "order" and "chaos," "safety" and "peril," "fullness" and "emptiness," and "peace" and "danger," they did not truly reveal the conditions for the mutual transformation of these opposites due to historical limitations. Therefore, they could not truly solve the problem of the transformation between the two.

Marxism does not talk about the transformation of conditions abstractly, but first analyzes the nature of the two opposing aspects. For example, when talking about "benefit" and "harm," it first looks at what kind of "benefit" and "harm" it is. There is true "benefit" and there is false "benefit"; there is what appears to be "benefit" on the surface, but is actually "harm"; there is temporary "benefit," but in the long run it is "harm." There is "harm" in progress, and there is "harm" in decline; there is "harm" that can be overcome, and there is "harm" that cannot be overcome. For the revolutionary class and party, because they represent the upward-developing new force, and the objective law of the development of things is that new things overcome dying things, so although they seem weak and full of difficulties in a certain period, overall, their "benefit" is fundamental, and their "harm" can be overcome. For all reactionaries, although they seem powerful temporarily, because they belong to the forces of decay, decline, and decline, their "benefit" is temporary, and their "harm" is incurable. This law has been fully proven by the experience of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

However, does this mean that as long as they are a revolutionary class, they can only consider favorable conditions and good possibilities when formulating plans and policies? In reality, there are indeed a few people who, as Engels said, "take their own impatience as a theoretical basis," thinking that we can do whatever we want, and that the road forward is always "smooth sailing" and "unobstructed." They forget that possibility is not yet reality, that good possibilities will not turn into reality on their own, and that bad possibilities will not disappear on their own. They forget Lenin's important instructions: "When estimating the situation, Marxists should not proceed from possible situations, but from the actual situation." "Revolutionary tactics can never be determined solely on the basis of revolutionary sentiment." The reality is that although we have achieved unprecedented great victories, and firmly believe that our cause will ultimately triumph, every step we take forward is the result of struggling against various difficulties, and we will encounter many unexpected difficulties in continuing to move forward. In contrast to those who only see favorable conditions and do not see difficult conditions, our party has never based its preparations on such "naive" and "good" wishes when formulating plans and policies. Instead, it soberly estimates the difficulties we may encounter under any circumstances, makes full preparations spiritually and materially, and has thorough coping methods. Our party prepares for the worst and strives for the best. For example, in terms of the grain problem, we must strive for bumper harvests every year in our actual actions, but we do not build our preparations on the possibility of bumper harvests every year, but prepare to deal with crop failures and other unexpected events. We would rather prepare and not use it than use it without preparation. Sun Tzu said: "The law of using troops is not to rely on the enemy not coming, but to rely on our ability to be prepared for him; not to rely on the enemy not attacking, but to rely on our ability to make ourselves unattackable." This is true for military affairs, and it is also true for other work. Only with preparations for dealing with crop failures can we effectively mobilize forces to strive for bumper harvests. Of course, the "preparation" mentioned here is not a passive "preparation." At the same time as "preparing," we must try our best to eliminate the possibility of danger.

Why should we take such an attitude to consider problems? This is a question of respecting objective laws, and it is a question of holding a basic attitude of humility towards objective laws. Objective things themselves are very complex, they have many aspects, and they are in constant motion and change. It is impossible for people to grasp all their inevitability and laws at once. Marxism-Leninism has given us the correct viewpoint and method for understanding and observing the world, but recognition takes a process. At the same time, due to the limitations of various conditions, we inevitably make mistakes and errors in the process of recognizing objective laws. It often happens that in the process of the development of things, factors that we consider unimportant or insignificant later become decisive factors; we think we have mastered a certain law, but in fact, we have only mastered a part of it, or even have not touched it at all. Before good possibilities have become reality, bad possibilities will still not disappear. Therefore, before we have achieved victory, no one is qualified to guarantee that: "A certain possibility will never happen," "Difficulties or temporary setbacks will not reappear." Holding a humble attitude towards objective laws can enable us to study and discover the internal laws of things with an open mind, gradually improve our awareness of progress, and avoid or reduce mistakes.

Doing revolution and doing work is not gambling. We should rely on scientific analysis, not on chance; we cannot make decisions based on "wishes" and "possibilities," and we cannot bet everything on a certain "possibility." In the early days of the victory of the October Revolution, some people pinned their hopes on the world revolution, hoping to use a worldwide revolution to get rid of the difficulties encountered by the Soviets at that time. Lenin resolutely criticized this idea, saying: "Perhaps the socialist revolution will triumph in a few weeks, or even a few days, - this is entirely possible, - but we cannot bet everything on this. We must prepare to deal with very great difficulties, and to deal with those very serious and unavoidable failures." Similarly, we may achieve bumper harvests every year, but we must never gamble everything and eat all the grain this year in one year. Putting bets on "luck" is dangerous and unscientific. Therefore, a revolutionary must never forget objective laws because of the victories achieved, and try to rely on accidental "luck" to win. We must always have such sensitivity: to be able to see the unfavorable aspects from favorable conditions; to be able to see the dangerous factors from the budding state, even if this factor is extremely inconspicuous and extremely insignificant. As the saying goes: "It is not afraid of ten thousand, but afraid of one in ten thousand." Small dangers can often lead to great disasters, and a match can cause the destruction of thousands of acres of forest. Therefore, we must not only see "ten thousand," but also see "one in ten thousand"; we should not wait until difficulties occur before preparing, but should be prepared before the danger occurs. This is the so-called "guard against it when it is invisible, and prevent it before it happens."

Some people ask, will such a way of thinking hurt people's enthusiasm? Thinking of crop failure in times of abundance and thinking of difficulties in times of success are not intended to weaken people's enthusiasm, but to put people's enthusiasm on a reliable basis. Right-leaning conservatives also see difficulties, but they only see difficulties, and even exaggerate the difficulties, so that they are frightened and lose their minds. Therefore, they play a role in promoting retreat. In contrast, Marxists look at difficulties on the basis of being sure of their victory. They look at difficulties in order to mobilize forces to overcome them. Therefore, they play a role in promoting and encouraging enthusiasm. It can be seen that the problem is not whether to see difficulties or not, but entirely depends on what point of view to look at it and what attitude to treat it.

### 丰收时想到歉收，顺利时想到困难

    丰收时想到歉收，顺利时想到困难
    徐非光
    丰收时想到歉收，顺利时想到困难；争取农业年年丰收，而对歉收的可能性时时作充分准备；争取持久和平，而对战争的危险性时刻保持高度的警惕。这是做工作、想问题、订计划的一个重要的思想方法。5月9日中共中央和国务院发布的关于及时做好夏季粮食、油料征购工作的指示中，有这样一段话：“无论城市和乡村，在粮食消费上都应当瞻前顾后，细水长流，丰收的时候想到歉收，今年想到明年”。这段话不仅对粮食工作是重要的，也不仅对经济工作是适用的，而且对我们作一切工作都有指导意义。
    搞任何工作，都存在着有利的和不利的条件，好的和坏的可能性。我们做工作就要对这些条件和可能性加以全面的客观的分析。既看到有利条件，又看到不利条件；既预计到好的可能性，又预计到坏的可能性。然后，通过正确的努力，充分地利用和发挥有利条件，促使好的可能性变为现实；避免和克服不利条件，防止坏的可能性发生作用。这就可以变不利为有利，变失败为胜利。只见有利条件和好的可能性，容易产生骄傲自满；只见困难条件和坏的可能性，则容易悲观失望，丧失斗志。这两种片面性都是十分危险的。只有对问题作全面分析，遇胜利时多想想困难，遇困难时多想想有利的一面，才能遇胜利而不骄，遇困难而不馁。在胜利时要争取“百尺竿头，再进一步”；遇困难时则要争取“化险为夷”，“转败为胜”。
    对于这一点，我们的古人在一定程度上也是懂得的。例如，他们说过：“祸兮福之所倚，福兮祸之所伏”（老子）；“智者之虑，必杂于利害”（孙子）；“虽处利地必思所以害，虽处害地必思所以利”（张预）；“满则虑嗛，平则虑险，安则虑危”（荀子）。他们虽然在不同程度上懂得了“利” 与“害”、“治”与“乱”、“安”与“危”、“满”与“嗛”、“平”与“险”之间互相对立而又互相转化的辩证关系，但是由于历史条件的限制，他们没有真正揭示出这些对立面的互相转化的条件。因此，他们就不可能真正解决这两者之间的转化问题。
    马克思主义不是抽象地谈条件的转化，而是首先来分析对立的两个方面的性质。例如，在谈到“利”和“害”时，就首先看，那是什么性质的“利”和“害”。有真“利”，也有假“利”；有表面上是“利”，而实际上却是“害”；有暂时是“利”，而从长远来看却是“害”。有前进中的“害”，也有没落中的“害”；有可能克服的“害”，也有不可能克服的“害”。对革命的阶级和政党来说，因为他们是代表着向上发展着的新生的力量，而新生的事物战胜垂死的事物是事物发展的客观规律，所以尽管他们在一定时期看来是弱小的，困难重重的，但是从总体来说，他们的“利”是根本的，他们的“害”则是可以克服的。而对于一切反动派来说，尽管他们暂时看来是强大的，但是由于他们是属于衰朽、没落、走下坡路的力量，所以他们的“利”是暂时的，他们的“害”则是无可救药的。这一条规律，已经由中国人民与帝国主义、国民党反动派斗争的经验所完全证明了。
    但是，这是不是说，只要是革命的阶级，他们在制定计划和政策时，就可以只考虑到有利的条件和好的可能性呢？在现实中确实有少数人，像恩格斯说的那样，“把自己的急躁性当作理论根据”，认为我们想怎样便可以怎样，在前进的道路上总是“一帆风顺”，“畅行无阻”。他们忘记了可能性还不是现实性，好的可能性不会自己变为现实，坏的可能性也不会自己消失。他们忘记了列宁的这些重要指示：“马克思主义者估计时局的时候不应当根据可能的情形出发，而应当根据现实的情形出发。”“革命策略决不能只根据革命情绪来规定。”而现实的情况是，虽然我们取得了史无前例的巨大胜利，而且坚信我们的事业必然最后胜利，但是我们前进的每一步都是与各种各样的困难作斗争的结果，而且在继续前进中还会遭到许多意想不到的困难。与那种只见有利条件、不见困难条件的人相反，我们党在制定计划和政策时，从来不是把准备工作放在那种“天真”的“良好”愿望的基础上，而是在任何条件下都清醒地估计到我们可能遇到的困难，在精神和物质上作充分的准备，有周密的对付办法。我们党从最坏的地方作准备，而向最好的地方努力。例如，在粮食问题方面，我们在实际行动上要争取年年丰收，但是我们不把准备工作建筑在年年丰收的可能性上，而是准备应付歉收和其他的意外事件。我们宁可备而不用，不能用而不备。孙子说：“用兵之法，无恃其不来，恃吾有以待之，无恃其不攻，恃吾有所不可攻也。”这对用兵是真理，对其他工作也是真理。有了应付歉收的准备，才能有效地动员力量去争取丰收。当然，这里说到的“备”，都不是消极的“备”，在“备”的同时我们要尽力消灭发生危险的可能性。
    为什么我们要采取这样的态度来考虑问题呢？这是对客观规律的尊重问题，是对客观规律持起码的谦逊态度的问题。客观事物本身就是十分复杂的，它具有许许多多的侧面，并且处于不断运动变化之中，人们不可能一下子就掌握其全部的必然性和规律。马克思列宁主义给了我们正确地认识和观察世界的观点和方法，但是认识是要有一个过程的。同时，由于种种条件的限制，我们在认识客观规律的过程中，也难免发生错觉和失误。常常有这样的情况，在事物发展的过程中，我们认为不重要的或不显著的因素，在后来却变成了决定性的因素；我们认为掌握了某一个规律，而实际上却只掌握了一部分甚至还根本没有摸到。在好的可能性还没有变成现实之前，坏的可能性就仍然不会消失。因此，在我们还没有取得胜利之前，谁也没有资格打保票说：“某一种可能性绝对不会发生”，
  “困难或暂时的挫折不会再现”。抱着对客观规律的谦逊态度，就可以使我们虚心地去研究和发现事物的内在规律，使我们逐步地提高我们前进的自觉性，使我们不犯或少犯错误。
    搞革命，搞工作，这不是赌博。我们应当靠科学分析，而不应当靠偶然性取胜；我们不能根据“愿望”和“可能性”来作决定，更不能在某一个“可能性”上作孤注一掷。十月革命胜利初期，曾经有人把希望寄托在世界革命上面，希望用世界范围的革命来摆脱当时苏维埃所遇到的困难。列宁坚决地批判了这种思想，他说：“也许社会主义革命在几星期后，甚或几天之后，就会胜利，——这是完全可能的，——可是我们终不能拿这来作孤注一掷。我们应当准备应付非常大的困难，应付那些非常严重而不可避免的失败。”同样，我们可能年年取得丰收，但是我们绝不能孤注一掷，把今年的粮食一年吃光。把赌注下在“幸运”上是危险的，而且是违反科学的。因此，一个革命者，绝对不能因为取得的胜利而忘记了客观的规律，企图依靠偶然的“幸运”而获胜。必须永远都具有这样的敏感性：能从顺利的条件下，看到不利的方面；能从萌芽状态中，看到危险的因素，那怕这种因素是极不明显、极其微不足道。俗语说：“不怕一万，就怕万一”。小的危险常常可能酿成大灾，一根火柴可能造成万顷森林的毁灭。因此，不仅要看到“一万”，也要看到“万一”；不要等到困难发生了再准备，而要在危险未发生前即有了准备。这就是所谓“戒之于无形，防之于未然”。
    有人问，这样的思想方法会不会伤害人们的干劲呢？丰收想到歉收，顺利想到困难，不是为了削弱人们的干劲，而正是为了把人们的干劲放在可靠的基础上。右倾保守主义者也看困难，但是他们仅仅看到困难，甚至夸大了困难，被困难吓得魂不附体，因此，他们起的是促退的作用。与此相反，马克思主义者是在确信自己必胜的基础上来看困难的，他们看困难是为了调动力量去克服它，因此，他们起的是促进和鼓干劲的作用。可见，问题不在于看不看困难，而全在于用什么观点去看它，用什么态度去对待它。
