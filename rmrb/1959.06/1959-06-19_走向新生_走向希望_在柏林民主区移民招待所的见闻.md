    Towards a New Life, Towards Hope
    — Observations at the Immigrant Reception Center in the Democratic Sector of Berlin
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Xinmin
    On Blankenfelder Straße, a street in the northern suburbs of the Democratic Sector of Berlin, there are several newly built bungalows. This is an immigrant reception center established by the government of the German Democratic Republic to settle immigrants from West Germany and West Berlin. The reception center was originally scheduled to start operating in April this year, but due to the urgent situation, the date had to be brought forward by one month. From March to now, the reception center has been almost full every day. Two new guest rooms are under construction to accommodate more guests.
    The German Democratic Republic has set up such reception centers in some areas close to West Germany and West Berlin. The Blankenfelde reception center specializes in receiving workers, clerks, and handicraftsmen. Some of the immigrants are over sixty years old, and some are only a few days old. These little guests were born in the German Democratic Republic. Their parents have been unemployed for a long time and simply cannot afford to have them born in hospitals in West Germany or West Berlin, so the whole family came to the German Democratic Republic. In the first four months of this year, the number of residents who moved to the German Democratic Republic with their families increased by more than 80% compared to the same period last year. In the Blankenfelde reception center, there are many such families who have moved in. The reception center has prepared special family dormitories for them.
    A mother with three children talked about her feelings when she came to the German Democratic Republic: her husband was unemployed, and the whole family in West Germany couldn't even get a room to live in, so they had to live in a broken car. The children were so hungry and weak that they couldn't live any longer. On their first day at the reception center, they were surprised to see butter on the table. The rumors created by the West German propaganda machine immediately surfaced—there is no butter to eat in the German Democratic Republic. It must not be real butter, at most it is artificial. But when they tasted the fragrance of butter, this shameful rumor was shattered. However, the couple were still talking about it, probably giving special treatment to the new guests on the first day, not expecting that they would often eat butter in their daily free meals. In addition to the necessary milk and other foods every day, the children also received candy. Now, her husband also has hope of finding a job. She said with a smile that she had grown better in the few days she had been here.
    Among the guests at the Blankenfelde reception center, there are many such unemployed workers. Some have been unemployed for several months, and some have been unemployed for several years without a fixed occupation. A thirty-year-old, strong male worker, who used to be a machine worker, lost his job ten years ago and switched to construction work, doing odd jobs everywhere. Finally, he became a so-called "agricultural worker," with work for a few days and no work for a few days. He hasn't even rented a room in all these years. After muddling along like this for ten years, he finally decided to come to the German Democratic Republic. He had not been in the reception center for a few days when he found a job. The worker was overjoyed and couldn't bother to talk to others, so he packed his luggage and prepared to leave the reception center. The other guests in the reception center were also like this, and they could generally go to work in eight days to two weeks.
    As with some other immigrant reception centers, there are also young and strong lads in the Blankenfelde reception center, all of whom are evading military service. According to statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, from April 1957 to the beginning of May 1959, more than 40,600 West German young men aged eighteen to twenty-five had fled to the German Democratic Republic in two years. They are not all supporters of socialism, but when asked why they came to the German Democratic Republic, the answer is consistent: "Cannot serve the Americans," "Germans cannot fight their German brothers," "This is peaceful construction!" After many young people were enlisted, they saw that the officers in the Federal Defense Forces were all former Nazi soldiers, talking about revenge and preparing for war, so they looked for opportunities to flee to the German Democratic Republic.
    Among the immigrants, some people have painful experiences. A young man named Horst Larisch believed the propaganda of the RIAS radio station in West Berlin last year and fled to West Berlin to find a "golden life." But he got the opposite. He lived in a refugee camp in West Berlin for six months, with eighteen people squeezed into one room, and not enough to eat. He had to run to the labor inspection office twice a week, but still couldn't find a job. American organizations under the banner of "American Labor Company" were recruiting people, paying more than two hundred marks a month, saying they were to be spies for the Americans. Such a "golden life" shattered the young man's illusions, and finally he decided to return to the Democratic Sector of Berlin. The reception center also accepted such former fugitives without any discrimination and helped them arrange their lives and work.
    For many years, the Adenauer group has used the issue of escape as a weapon to wage psychological warfare against the German Democratic Republic. Inducing and instigating wavering elements in the German Democratic Republic to flee to West Germany and West Berlin is one of the main tasks of Western spy agencies. However, in the past six months, things have been undergoing new changes. Every month, thousands of residents of West Germany and West Berlin flee to the German Democratic Republic; not only unemployed workers and young people evading military service, but also intellectuals and political figures, and even a key staff member of the West German Gehlen Organization who had been a spy for twenty-five years, also brought files to the German Democratic Republic seeking political asylum. During the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, more West German and West Berlin residents fled to the German Democratic Republic than in the past.
    Despite the Adenauer group's boasting that West Germany's economy is a "miraculous" development, they cannot stop the attack of the deepening economic crisis. Adenauer's policy of atomic armament for the purpose of revanchism is becoming increasingly clear as a negative teacher for the people of West Germany. On the contrary, the German Democratic Republic's peaceful construction and policies of seeking understanding and rapprochement between the two Germanys, its growing international prestige and economic strength, are gradually increasing its attractiveness to residents of West Germany. In the Blankenfelde immigrant reception center, people can clearly see a portrayal of this new change. A group of people from West Germany are starting to walk towards a new life.

### 走向新生　走向希望——在柏林民主区移民招待所的见闻

    走向新生　走向希望
    ——在柏林民主区移民招待所的见闻
    本报记者　张辛民
    在柏林民主区北郊一条叫做勃兰肯费尔德的大街上，有几幢新盖起的平房，这里是德意志民主共和国政府安置从西德和西柏林迁来的移民的一座招待所。这座招待所原定今年4月开始工作，但迫于形势需要，不得不把日期提前一个月。从3月到现在，招待所几乎天天客满。两幢新的客房正在加紧施工，准备接待更多的客人。
    德意志民主共和国靠近西德和西柏林的一些地方，都设有这样的招待所。勃兰肯费尔德招待所是专门接待工人、店员和手工业者的。这里的移民有的年过六十，有的才只有几天的生命，这些小客人们都是在德意志民主共和国出生的，他们的父母长期失业，实在没有能力让他们在西德或西柏林的医院出世了，因此全家到德意志民主共和国来。今年头四个月，全家迁到德意志民主共和国来的居民较去年同期增加80％以上。在勃兰肯费尔德招待所里就住着不少这样全家迁移过来的。招待所为他们准备了专门的家庭宿舍。
    一位有三个孩子的母亲谈起她来到德意志民主共和国的心情：她丈夫失业，在西德全家混不上一间住房，只好住在一辆破汽车里，孩子饿得十分瘦弱，实在生活不下去了。他们第一天刚到招待所时，看到餐桌上有黄油，全家心里都感到惊奇，西德宣传机器制造的谣言马上浮上来——在德意志民主共和国没有黄油吃。一定不是真黄油，顶多是人造的。但当他们尝到黄油的香味时，这个可耻的谣言就破了产。但是夫妻俩还谈论着，大概是对第一天新来的客人特别优待，没有想到，以后在他们每天的免费伙食中经常吃到黄油。孩子们除了每天必需的牛奶等食品外，还得到糖果。现在，丈夫的工作也有了希望。她笑着说，到这里几天，人也长得好了。
    在勃兰肯费尔德招待所的客人中，有许多人都是这样的失业工人，其中有的失业几个月，有的失业长达几年，没有固定职业。一个三十岁、身强力壮的男工人，原来是机器工，十年前失了业，改行当建筑工，到处打零活，最后又成了所谓“农业工人”，几天有活干，几天又没有工作，多少年来他连一间住房都没租上。这样混了十年，这回下决心来到德意志民主共和国来。他在招待所没有住上几天，已经找到了职业，这个工人喜出望外，顾不得和别人谈话，就去收拾行装，准备离开招待所了。招待所里的其他客人也都如此，一般住上八天到两星期就可以走上工作岗位了。
    和其他一些移民招待所的情况一样，在勃兰肯费尔德招待所中也有年青力壮的小伙子，他们都是逃避兵役的。据德意志民主共和国内务部统计，从1957年4月到1959年5月初两年期间已有四万零六百多名十八岁到二十五岁的西德青年男子逃到德意志民主共和国。他们并不都是社会主义的拥护者，但在谈到为什么要到德意志民主共和国来时，回答却是一致的：“不能为美国人卖命”，“德国人不能打自己的德国兄弟”，“这里是和平建设呀！”许多青年被征入伍后，看到联邦国防军中的大小军官尽是过去的纳粹军人，讲的都是复仇备战的话，便找机会逃到德意志民主共和国来。
    在移民中，有一些人还有着痛苦的经历。一个名叫豪斯特·拉瑞希的青年，去年他轻信了美国设在西柏林的里亚斯电台的宣传，逃到西柏林去寻找“金色的生活”。但是他得到的恰好相反。他在西柏林难民营住了六个月，十八个人挤在一间房子里，吃不饱饭。每星期得跑两次劳动检查所，还没有找到工作。打着“美国劳动公司”招牌的美国组织在招人，每月二百多马克，说明是给美国人当特务。这样的“金色的生活”使这个年青人的幻想破灭了，最后他下决心回到柏林民主区来。对于这样的过去的逃亡者，招待所也毫无歧视地接纳下来，帮助他们安排生活和工作。
    多年以来，阿登纳集团用逃亡问题作为向德意志民主共和国进行心理战的一个武器。引诱、策动德意志民主共和国内不坚定分子逃向西德和西柏林，是西方特务间谍机关的主要任务之一。但是，半年多来，事情正在发生新的变化。每月都有成千的西德和西柏林居民逃向德意志民主共和国；不只是失业工人和逃避兵役的青年，还有知识分子和政界人士，甚至一个干了二十五年特务的西德盖伦组织主要工作人员，也背了档案到德意志民主共和国请求政治避难。日内瓦外长会议期间，逃向德意志民主共和国的西德和西柏林居民较过去更多。
    尽管阿登纳集团吹嘘西德经济是“奇迹式”的发展，但是他们无法阻止正在加深的经济危机的袭击。阿登纳的以复仇主义为目的的原子武装政策，正在日益清楚地成为西德人民的反面教员。相反，德意志民主共和国的和平建设和争取两个德国谅解、接近的政策，它的日益增长着的国际威信和经济力量，正在逐渐增加它对西德居民的吸引力。在勃兰肯费尔德移民招待所里，人们清楚地看到这个新变化的写照。一批来自西德开始走向新生活的人们。　德意志通讯社稿（新华社发）在埃森纳赫接待站的一群西德青年们。　德意志通讯社稿（新华社发）
