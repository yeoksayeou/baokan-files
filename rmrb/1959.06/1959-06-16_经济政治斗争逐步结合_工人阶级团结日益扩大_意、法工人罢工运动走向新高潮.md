Economic and Political Struggles Gradually Combine; Working-Class Solidarity Increasingly Expands
Italian and French Workers' Strike Movements Reach New Climax

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Italian sailors' general strike, which began on the 9th, is expanding further. Currently, 60,000 sailors are participating in the strike, affecting a total of 15 shipping routes connecting Italy with both domestic and foreign ports. Nearly 70 ships have been forced to halt operations.
    This strike was jointly initiated by various trade union organizations with differing political leanings, including the Italian General Confederation of Labour and the Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions. Several weeks ago, the sailors' union engaged in negotiations with shipowners regarding the signing of a new wage increase contract. During the negotiations, the sailors demanded a 30% wage increase, but the shipowners only agreed to a 6% increase. Due to the shipowners' refusal to meet the sailors' reasonable demands, the negotiations ultimately broke down. Consequently, the sailors' union issued a strike call to merchant seamen. Sailors in Italian ports were the first to respond to the strike call. Subsequently, sailors on merchant ships sailing abroad also telegraphed their support and actively joined the ranks of the strikers. Currently, ships worldwide, including large ocean liners exceeding 10,000 tons, are docked in foreign ports.
    A spokesperson for the Italian Shipowners' Association admitted that the strike is costing shipowners 70 to 100 million lira per day and significantly damaging Italy's tourism industry. Therefore, shipowners are using various methods to undermine the strike.
    When all sabotage attempts failed, the shipowners were forced to make concessions, expressing their willingness to negotiate with the sailors' union and consider a 20% wage increase. However, they conditioned this on the sailors immediately ending the strike. Simultaneously, the Italian Minister of Merchant Marine personally intervened, threatening and deceiving the sailors to resume work immediately. However, the sailors' unions sternly rejected the shipowners' and the Minister of Merchant Marine's coercion, insisting on conducting negotiations during the strike to assess the sincerity of the shipowners in meeting the sailors' reasonable demands.
    Currently, concurrent with the Italian sailors' general strike, Italian textile workers and 600,000 state机关职员 also held strikes in many cities on the 10th. Furthermore, Italian Communist and non-Communist bank employee unions announced an indefinite strike on the 15th. According to United Press International, the current wave of strikes sweeping Italy is aimed at opposing the reactionary policies of the Segni government in Italy.

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 14th (Reporter Yang Xiaonong) reports: The 32nd National Congress of the French General Confederation of Labour opened today in Ivry, a southeastern suburb of Paris. On the eve of the congress, a massive struggle to counter the Debré government's infringement on workers' rights is brewing.
    This struggle began in the state-owned railway sector. Recently, railway workers, due to rising living costs, once again demanded that the government fulfill its promise of increasing wages, but the government flatly rejected the workers' reasonable demands. As a result, the four major railway unions in France decided to strike for eight hours on June 16th. The Debré government issued requisition orders for railway workers, attempting to undermine the strike. However, this oppressive measure not only failed to intimidate the railway workers but also angered workers in other industries, who rose up to support the railway workers. They emphasized that the Debré government's actions violated the constitutional right to strike for workers, and it was aimed not only at railway workers but at the entire French working class.
    Observers here pointed out that the above situation indicates that a new high tide is forming in the French labor movement; it is moving towards the goal of concerted action, and the workers' struggles are gradually taking on the nature of political struggles.
    The progress of the French labor movement over the past year shows that the working class's concerted action has made great progress. According to materials published by the French General Confederation of Labour, there are now agreements for concerted action among various system of trade unions in eighty-one provinces in mainland France; eighteen national industrial unions also have similar agreements for concerted action.
    It is particularly noteworthy that the French workers' struggle is increasingly and evidently taking on the nature of political struggle. Although this railway workers' struggle began with the economic demand of wage increases, when the Debré government announced the requisition order, the struggle's objective became mainly to defend the workers' political rights – the right to strike. In addition, according to "Le Monde," leaders of the French General Confederation of Labour have pointed out that French workers have deeply felt the impact of the continuation and escalation of the Algerian war on the entire political, economic, and social life of France. Therefore, the slogan of demanding an end to the Algerian war has been constantly appearing in recent workers' struggles. The French working class has gradually understood in actual struggle that it is difficult to imagine obtaining their reasonable economic demands alone without opposing the government's entire reactionary policy.

### 经济政治斗争逐步结合　工人阶级团结日益扩大  意、法工人罢工运动走向新高潮

    经济政治斗争逐步结合　工人阶级团结日益扩大
    意、法工人罢工运动走向新高潮
    本报讯　从9日开始的意大利海员大罢工正在进一步扩大。现在参加罢工的海员达六万人，受到罢工影响的共有十五条连结意大利本国和意大利同外国各港口的航线，并且有将近七十艘船只被迫停驶。
    这次罢工是意大利总工会、意大利劳动人民工会联合会等不同政治倾向的工会组织联合发动的。数周以前，海员工会曾与船主进行关于签订增加工资的新合同的谈判。在谈判中海员们提出要求增加工资30％，但是船主们却只肯提高6％。由于船主们拒绝海员们的合理要求，谈判终于破裂。于是海员工会向商船海员们发出罢工的号召。在意大利港口的海员们首先响应了罢工的号召。之后行驶在国外的商船上的海员也纷纷打电报回来，积极参加罢工者的队伍。目前在世界各地包括万吨以上的大邮船正停泊在国外的港口。
    意大利船主协会的发言人承认，这次罢工使船主们每天损失七千万到一亿里拉，并且大大损害了意大利的游览事业。因此船主们正在用各种方法破坏罢工。
    当一切破坏办法失效之后，船主们不得不作让步，表示可以同海员工会谈判，考虑提高工资20％。但是它又要以海员们立即结束罢工为条件。与此同时，意大利商运部部长也亲自出马，威胁和欺骗海员立即复工。但是各海员工会严正地拒绝了船主们和商运部部长的要挟，他们坚持必须在罢工时期内进行谈判，以视船主们有无诚意满足海员们的合理要求。
    目前，在意大利海员大罢工的同时，意大利纺织工人和六十万国家机关职员也在10日在许多城市举行罢工。此外，意大利共产党和非共产党的银行职工工会也宣布于15日举行时间未定的罢工。据合众国际社报道，目前席卷意大利的这次罢工浪潮是旨在反对意大利的塞尼政府的反动政策的。
    据新华社巴黎14日电　本社记者杨效农报道：法国总工会第三十二次全国代表大会今日在巴黎东南郊的伊符里市开幕。在大会前夕，一场规模巨大的反击德勃雷政府侵犯工人权利的斗争，正在酝酿中。
    这场斗争首先是在国营的铁路部门开始的。最近，铁路工人因为生活费用上涨，再次要求政府履行提高工资的诺言，而政府却断然拒绝了工人们的合理要求。这样，法国四大铁路工会就决定在6月16日罢工八小时，德勃雷政府发布了征调铁路工人的命令，企图破坏罢工。但是这种高压手段不仅没有吓退铁路工人，反而激怒了其他行业的工人，他们纷纷起来支持铁路工人。他们着重指出，德勃雷政府的上述措施违反了宪法规定的工人罢工权，它不仅是针对铁路工人，而且是针对法国整个工人阶级的。
    这里的观察家指出，上述情况表明：法国的工人运动正在形成新的高潮；它正在向一致行动的目标前进，而且，工人们的斗争已经逐渐带有政治斗争的性质。
    一年来法国工人运动的进程表明，工人阶级的一致行动已经有了很大进展。根据法国总工会公布的材料，现在，法国本土已经有八十一个省的各种系统的工会有了一致行动的协议；十八个全国性的产业工会也已经有类似的一致行动协议。
    人们特别注意到，法国工人的斗争日益明显地具有政治斗争的性质。这次铁路工人的斗争虽然以增加工资的经济要求开始，但是，当德勃雷政府宣布征调令后，斗争目标就变为主要是保卫工人的政治权利——罢工权了。此外，据“世界报”报道，法国总工会领导人曾经指出，法国工人们已经深深感受到阿尔及利亚战争的延续和加剧给法国整个政治、经济和社会生活带来的影响。因此，近来的工人斗争中已经不断出现要求结束阿尔及利亚战争的口号。法国工人阶级在实际斗争中已经逐渐懂得不反对政府的整个反动政策而想单独获得自己合理的经济要求的满足，这是很难设想的。（附图片）
