    Natural Curiosities
    Melting Islands
    Soviet scientists have discovered that the Lyakhovsky Islands, located in the eastern part of the Taymyr Peninsula in the Arctic Ocean, are "melting." Geologically, these are a group of very strange islands, formed from Quaternary (the last period of the Cenozoic era in Earth's geological history) alluvial deposits, where the remains of mammoths and musk oxen have been found. However, the foundation beneath each island is a layer of ice. Due to global warming, the Arctic ice is moving northwards. The ice here is also melting.
    It seems that travelers wishing to visit the Lyakhovsky Islands should act quickly, or they will no longer be able to find any trace of them.
        "Compass Plant"
    The Soviet magazine "Around the World" recently reported that a so-called "compass plant" can be seen in many regions of the Soviet Union. The difference between this plant and other plants is that its leaves grow vertically on both sides of the leaf stem, and the leaf stem usually points north and south, like a compass needle.
    This "compass plant" is a wild lettuce species. Because its leaves grow vertically, it can reduce water evaporation, thus preserving its own survival in hot weather.
    The "compass plant" can point people in the right direction, and the more arid the region and the more water-deficient the soil in which the "compass plant" grows, the stronger its ability to adapt to arid climates, and the greater the accuracy of its directional indication.

    融化中的群岛
    苏联科学家发现，位于北冰洋泰麦尔半岛东部的里雅霍夫群岛，正在“融化”中。从地质结构看来，这是一群非常奇怪的岛屿，在这些由第四纪（地球地质史新生代最后一纪）冲积层形成的岛屿上发现过古象和麝香牛的骨骸。可是每一个岛下面的基础却都是冰层。由于地球转暖，北极冰层正在向北方移动。这里的冰层也在融化。
    由此看来，凡是欲访里雅霍夫群岛的旅行家应当行动从速，否则就再也找不到它们的踪迹了。
        “指南草”
    苏联“环球”杂志最近一期报道，在苏联很多地区都会看到一种所谓“指南草”，这种植物和其他植物的区别在于，它的叶子垂直地生长在叶茎的两侧，而叶茎通常是像罗盘针那样，指向南北。
    这种“指南草”是一种野生的莴苣属植物，由于它的叶子是垂直生长的，所以它可以减少水分蒸发作用，而在炎热的天气里也可保全本身的生存。
    “指南草”可以为人指明方向，而且，越是在干旱地区和缺乏水分的土壤里生长的“指南草”，它的适应干燥气候的性能就越强，它指示方向的准确性也就越大。
