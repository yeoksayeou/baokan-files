    A Large Meteorite
    Fifty-one years ago today, on June 30, 1908, at seven o'clock in the morning, in the sky over Central Siberia, a dazzling fireball flew swiftly from southeast to northwest, followed by a rumble of sound. The ground also seemed to experience an earthquake: windowpanes shattered, and many old buildings collapsed.
    This was a phenomenon caused by a large meteorite weighing hundreds of thousands of tons falling north of the Central Tunguska River. At that time, it was seen within a range of 1,500 kilometers from the Yenisei River to the Lena River. The explosion sound was heard within a diameter of 2,000 kilometers, and seismographs around the world recorded seismic waves. In the nights following the meteorite's impact, the night sky was very bright, so bright that one could read a newspaper without a lamp even in the Caucasus.
    Only ten giant meteorites as large as the Tunguska meteorite have been discovered so far, and the two largest fell in Siberia. The other one fell on February 12, 1947, at eleven o'clock in the morning, in the Lao Ye Ridge mountain range near Vladivostok, hence it is called the Lao Ye Ridge meteorite.
    According to research by Soviet scientists, the Lao Ye Ridge meteorite and the Tunguska meteorite are different. The former approached from behind the Earth, with a speed of only 11 to 12 kilometers per second; the latter rushed towards the Earth head-on, with a speed as high as 50 to 60 kilometers per second. Therefore, although the Tunguska meteorite was much larger than the Lao Ye Ridge meteorite, it burned up in the air due to its high speed, making it difficult to find its fragments on the ground. The Lao Ye Ridge meteorite, due to its low speed, left more fragments on the ground, and 37 tons of fragments have now been collected. These fragments can be used to directly study the chemical composition of celestial bodies.
    The fact that the fragments of the Tunguska meteorite are difficult to find has recently been given a new explanation by Soviet scientist Rokionov. He said that the cause of the explosion was not the meteorite itself, but the shock wave produced by its high-speed flight. Some calculations he made proved that the shock wave produced by a meteorite with a diameter of 30 to 100 meters moving at a speed of 10 to 50 kilometers per second is equivalent to the effect of 10 million tons of explosives, which is more powerful than an atomic bomb. Fortunately, the Earth has an atmosphere as a shield, saving mankind from the attack of this "cosmic bomb." Therefore, he believes that the fragments of the Tunguska meteorite should not be searched for at the center of the explosion, but in the northwest direction of the center, which has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the study of the Tunguska meteorite is far from over.
    Where did these large meteorites come from? In the past few years, it was generally believed that they were encounters between asteroids and the Earth. However, recently, Soviet scientist Kazantsev proposed that the Tunguska meteorite was a spacecraft from Mars. The truth of this statement remains to be studied in the future.

    一颗大陨星
    五十一年前的今天，1908年6月30日上午七点钟，在中西伯利亚的天空，有一个雪亮的火球飞速地从东南向西北掠空而过，紧接着发生了隆隆般的响声。地面上也好像发生地震一样：门窗的玻璃碎了，许多旧建筑物也倒塌了。
    这是一个几十万吨重的大流星落在中通古斯卡河以北所引起的现象。当时从叶尼塞河到勒拿河之间一千五百公里的范围内都曾看见，爆炸声则在直径为二千公里的范围内都曾听到，世界各地的地震仪上都有地震波纪录下来。流星降落后的头几夜中，夜天光非常明亮，甚至在高加索，不用点灯就可以看报。
    像通古斯卡这样大的巨型陨星，至今发现的只有十个，其中最大的两个都落在西伯利亚。另一个于1947年2月12日上午十一点钟，落在海参崴附近的老爷岭山脉中，因而称为老爷岭陨星。
    据苏联科学家们研究：老爷岭陨星和通古斯卡陨星不同。前者是从地球后面追上来的，速度只有每秒十一到十二公里；后者是迎面冲向地球来的，速度大到每秒五十到六十公里。所以尽管通古斯卡陨星比老爷岭陨星大得多，但由于速度太大，在空中都烧毁了，地面上难以找到它的碎片。老爷岭陨星由于速度小，落在地面上的碎片就比较多，现在已经收到三十七吨碎片。利用这些碎片可以直接研究天体的化学成分。
    通古斯卡陨星碎片难以找到这件事实，苏联罗基昂诺夫最近提出了一个新的解释。他说：陨星引起爆炸的原因并不是陨星本身，而是由于它以高速飞行时所产生的冲击波所致。他作的一些计算证明，直径为三十到一百米的陨星，每秒以十到五十公里的速度运动时所产生的冲击波，相当于一千万吨炸药的效应，比原子弹厉害得多。幸而地球有大气作盾牌，人类得免于这种“宇宙炸弹”的袭击。因此，他认为通古斯卡陨星的碎片不应在爆炸中心去找，而应在中心的西北方向即目前尚未考察的方向寻找。所以对于通古斯卡陨星的研究还远没有结束。
    这些大陨星都是从哪里飞来的？过去几年总认为是小行星和地球相遇。但最近苏联科学家卡赞切夫提出了通古斯卡陨星是来自火星的宇宙飞船。这一说法的真实性如何，还要等待以后研究。
