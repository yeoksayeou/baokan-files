    Vientiane Dispatch: "Lao Patriotic News" published on May 2 a letter from Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Patriotic Party, to Lao Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone, dated April 21. In this letter, Prince Souphanouvong expressed his opposition to the Lao authorities' conspiracy to amend the constitution.

    Prince Souphanouvong's letter was written before the Lao Royal Government launched an armed persecution against the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and surrounded his residence in Vientiane.

    In his letter, Prince Souphanouvong said that the Lao Patriotic Party and he himself believed that the current Lao Kingdom Constitution, which had been amended many times, although not perfect, generally conformed to the situation in Laos and the wishes of the people, and it made provisions for guaranteeing the democratic and free rights of the Lao people. The current problem is that the democratic and free rights stipulated in the Constitution have not been fully realized. Therefore, there is no need to amend the Constitution again under the current circumstances.

    In his letter, Prince Souphanouvong said that if the government had decided to establish a Constitutional Amendment Committee, the Lao Patriotic Party would have to send its representatives to participate in the committee. The Patriotic Party specifically designated Sisana Sisane as its representative to participate in the committee.

    Prince Souphanouvong finally said in his letter: "We believe that the practice of appointing the chairman and vice-chairman of this committee is incorrect, and this practice does not conform to the democratic principles stipulated in the Constitution."

    苏发努冯曾写信给萨纳尼空
    反对修改老挝宪法的阴谋
    本报讯　万象消息：“老挝爱国报”5月2日发表了老挝爱国党领袖苏发努冯亲王4月21日写给老挝首相培·萨纳尼空的一封信。苏发努冯亲王在这封信中表示反对老挝当局修改宪法的阴谋。
    苏发努冯亲王的这封信是在老挝王国政府对前寮国战斗部队发动武装迫害和包围他在万象的住宅之前写的。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中说，老挝爱国党和他本人认为，目前这项曾经多次修改过的老挝王国宪法，虽然并不十分完美，但是大体上还符合老挝的情况和人民的愿望，它在保证老挝人民的民主自由权利方面作了规定。目前的问题是宪法规定的民主自由权利还没有充分实现。因此，在目前情况下是不需要再次修改宪法的。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中说，但是，如果政府已经决定成立宪法修改委员会，那末，老挝爱国党就不得不派出它的代表参加这个委员会。爱国党特指定西沙那·师山作为它参加这个委员会的代表。
    苏发努冯亲王最后在信中说：“我们认为，指定这个委员会的主席和副主席的做法是不正确的，这种做法不符合宪法规定的民主原则。”
