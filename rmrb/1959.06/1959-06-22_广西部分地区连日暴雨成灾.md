    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 21st: Parts of Guangxi have been hit by continuous heavy rains, causing flooding. People in various areas are fighting day and night to combat the floods, provide disaster relief, and protect the harvest.
    In the four special districts of Nanning, Liuzhou, Yulin, and Wuzhou in Guangxi, rainfall from the 10th to the 14th ranged from 100 mm to over 300 mm, more than double the amount in the same period in previous years. It has continued to rain since the 15th, with heavier rainfall on the 17th and 18th. The heavy rains have caused rivers to rise rapidly, mountain torrents to erupt, and widespread flooding. Statistics up to the 17th show that more than 1.5 million mu of crops have been affected, of which more than 400,000 mu have suffered a 50% reduction in yield or complete crop failure.
    Currently, flood prevention headquarters have been established from the autonomous region level down to the districts, counties, and communes, strengthening leadership in this work. According to an inspection by the Liuzhou Special District, 40 out of 56 dangerous water conservancy projects have been basically secured after emergency repairs. Various localities are taking all possible measures to rescue waterlogged crops, including opening ditches for drainage, washing seedlings and applying fertilizer, supporting fallen crops, replanting, and rush-harvesting. Yulin Special District has already rescued 130,000 mu of crops.
    Commercial, transportation, water conservancy, meteorological, and materials supply departments in various areas have also been urgently mobilized to support flood prevention and disaster relief in terms of manpower and materials. The disaster-stricken people have been properly resettled and offered condolences.
