This dispatch from Zhengzhou on the 28th reports: The Tikou Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, convened a symposium on May 8th with the participation of elderly, middle-aged, and young peasants to discuss and study the density of this year's autumn crops based on summarizing past experience in close planting. At the meeting, through the clash of various opinions and by presenting facts and reasoning, a great debate led to unified understanding, and a principle of reasonable close planting – neither too sparse nor too dense – was established, thus finding a reasonable density for autumn crop seedlings. At the beginning of the symposium, the question of whether close planting was beneficial was immediately affirmed unanimously by all attendees. Everyone believed that the continuous improvement of agricultural production in recent years proved that reasonable close planting is the central link in increasing crop yields and one of the main experiences of the great leap forward in agricultural production. Close planting unlocks the potential of the land, increases the number of ears and grains per unit area, and improves yields. However, everyone also believed that close planting must be reasonable and that the reasonable density should be determined based on the quality of the soil, the level of management, fertilizer and water conditions, the characteristics of the crop, and regional and climatic differences, rather than blindly pursuing the densest possible planting. Some people who had doubts about close planting also raised opposing opinions at the meeting. Elderly commune member Wang Kunxiu said: If the crops are planted too densely, the plants will be thin, the leaves will be yellow, and the ears will be small. They will be prone to lodging in wind and rain. As the saying goes, "Dense planting lodges the crops, sparse planting collapses the house." Weren't some of this year's wheat "high-yield fields" lodged precisely because they were too dense? I think it's safer to leave the seedlings a bit sparse. His words immediately aroused opposition from young peasants. The young man Zhao Hongcheng said: "We can't look at new problems with old eyes. Who doesn't know that our team increased production by nearly 100% last year because of close planting!? Last year, labor model Hou Youhui planted two plots of cotton. The management was the same, and the soil was the same. As a result, the plot with more than 4,000 seedlings per mu produced more than 500 jin of seed cotton per mu, while the plot with 3,000 seedlings produced less than 400 jin per mu. Isn't this the benefit of close planting?" Production team leader Wang Baohui also said: "There are many reasons for wheat lodging this year, such as excessive nitrogen fertilizer and improper watering. Close planting has also brought some new problems, such as the need for more fertilizer and more watering. As long as we conscientiously follow the 'Eight-Character Charter' [soil improvement, rational fertilization, water conservancy, seed selection, close planting, plant protection, field management, and tool reform], close planting can fully utilize the soil fertility and achieve the goal of increasing production."

    At the meeting, the specifications for setting seedlings on autumn land were formally studied and determined based on the principle of reasonable close planting. Many old farmers put forward the density of different crops based on their own production experience. Zhao Deyou, an old farmer in his fifties, said: "When planting sorghum, if you use a two-legged seeder (row spacing of one chi and six cun [approximately 53 cm]) to leave 3,000 seedlings per mu, the plant spacing is too close; if you use a three-legged seeder (row spacing of eight cun [approximately 27 cm]) to leave 3,600 seedlings per mu, the ears will be larger and can increase production by 20%." Everyone also believed that for varieties with strong branching and tillering ability, the density could be smaller, while for varieties with weak tillering and branching ability, the density could be larger; for sweet potatoes with long vines, the density could be smaller, while for varieties with short vines, the density should be larger. Everyone also believed that in setting seedlings on autumn land, the conditions of soil, fertilizer, water, labor, and livestock are important conditions that determine close planting. After carefully studying each autumn crop, the reasonable density per mu for sorghum, cotton, corn, sweet potatoes, and millet was finally determined. After the close planting range was determined, the commune members present were very satisfied, believing that it conformed to the soil conditions, natural conditions, and current management level of the brigade, which strengthened their confidence in striving for a bumper harvest. Now, the entire brigade is carrying out various autumn crop seedling setting activities in accordance with this standard.

    商丘城关公社提口大队老年中年青年农民共集一堂
    为大秋定苗找到合理密度
    本报郑州28日电　密植有没有好处？怎样才算合理密植？河南省商丘县城郊公社提口大队在5月8日，召开了有老农、中年、青年农民参加的座谈会，通过总结历年来的密植经验，讨论研究了今年大秋作物密植的幅度。会上通过各种不同意见的交锋和摆事实，讲道理，大争大辩，统一了思想认识，确定了不宜太稀，也不宜太密的密植原则，为大秋定苗找到了一个合理的密度。座谈会开始，讨论了密植有没有好处？这个问题马上得到全体出席座谈会的人一致肯定，大家认为几年来农业生产不断提高的事实证明，合理密植是农作物增产的中心环节，是农业生产大跃进的主要经验之一，密植后发挥土地潜力，增加单位面积上的穗数和粒数，提高了产量。但是，大家也认为密植必须合理，要依据土质的好坏，管理水平，肥水条件，作物的特性，地区、气候的不同，来确定合理的密度，而不是越密越好，盲目的密植。有些对密植有怀疑的人在会上也提出了相反的意见，老年社员王坤秀说：庄稼种稠了，棵细叶黄穗头小，一遇风雨就要倒伏，俗话说：“稠倒庄稼稀倒房”，今年的小麦“高产田”有的不就是因为稠了才倒伏的吗？我看还是把苗留稀点保险。他的话马上引起青年农民的反对，小伙子赵洪成说：“不能拿老眼光看新问题，去年咱队因为密植增产将近一倍谁不知道！？去年，劳动模范侯友惠种的两块棉花，管理相同，土质相同，结果留苗四千多棵的亩产籽棉五百多斤，留苗三千棵的亩产不到四百斤，这不是密植好处是什么？”生产队长王宝惠也说：“今年小麦倒伏原因很多，如氮肥过多，浇水不当。密植也带来了一些新的问题，如需要多施肥，多浇水，只要认真按照‘八字宪法’办事，密植就能够充分利用地力，达到增产的目的。”
    会上，还依据合理密植的原则，正式研究和确定大秋地定苗的规格。许多老农都根据自己的生产经验，纷纷提出不同作物的密植程度。五十多岁的老农赵得友说：“种高粱，如果用两条腿耧播种（行距一尺六寸）每亩留三千棵苗，棵距就太近了；要用三条腿耧播种（行距八寸），每亩留三千六百棵苗，穗头大，能够增产二成。”大家还认为分枝分蘖性强的品种，密度可以小些，分蘖分枝性弱的品种，密度就可以大些；红芋拖秧长的品种，密植可以小些，拖秧短的品种，密度要大些。大家还认为在进行大秋地定苗时，土壤、肥水、劳、畜力等好、坏情况，都是决定密植的重要条件。经过对大秋作物逐项认真的研究，最后确定了高粱、棉花、玉米、红芋、谷子每亩的合理密度，密植幅度确定后，到会的社员都十分满意，认为符合大队的土质情况，自然条件和当前的管理水平，增强了争取丰收的信心。现在，全大队正依据这个标准，紧张进行各种大秋作物的定苗活动。
