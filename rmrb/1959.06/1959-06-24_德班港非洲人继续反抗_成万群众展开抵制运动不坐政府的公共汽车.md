Xinhua News Agency, Durban, June 23rd: The struggle of Africans in the Durban area of South Africa against the white government's implementation of racial discrimination policies is being carried out in various forms.

　　On the morning of June 22nd, two hundred African women demonstrated in front of the municipal government office in KwaMashu, an African residential area in the northern suburbs of Durban. These Africans, who are subjected to oppression and exploitation by the white authorities, protested against the white authorities' installation of water meters in this area, as this would make them bear more water costs. Police arrived and used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.

　　On the same day, ten thousand Africans participated in a boycott of municipal government buses launched by Africans in Clermont, another suburban area. Thousands of African workers preferred to take private vehicles to Durban to work rather than take municipal buses.

　　In the Cato Manor area, where a large demonstration erupted, armed police are still stationed at the entrance of the municipal beer hall, with three armored vehicles ready to move at any time. After dark, naval searchlights continue to illuminate the mountains surrounding this area, which is filled with African shacks. The situation is also tense in other African areas of the city.

　　The African National Congress of South Africa plans to launch a nationwide campaign on the 26th to boycott enterprises and companies that support the white government. The South African federal authorities have stated that they are prepared to suppress it. Federal Minister of Justice Swart accused the African National Congress in the Federal Senate on the 22nd of being "a dangerous organization." He threatened that if Africans attempted to "undermine the laws of this country," he was prepared to take action on the 26th or at any other time. He announced that the Ministry of Justice had obtained eighty armored vehicles for police use.

    德班港非洲人继续反抗
    成万群众展开抵制运动不坐政府的公共汽车
    新华社23日讯　德班消息：南非德班地区非洲人反抗执行种族歧视政策的白人政府的斗争，在以多种形式进行着。
    22日上午，在德班北郊的非洲人居住区克瓦马舒，有两百名非洲妇女在这个地区的市府办公处前进行示威。这些备受白人当局压迫剥削的非洲人抗议白人当局在这个区域安装自来水表，因为这将使她们负担更多的自来水费。警察赶来使用催泪弹驱散示威群众。
    当天，非洲人在市郊另一个地区克莱尔蒙特展开的抵制市政府公共汽车的运动有一万非洲人参加。有数千名非洲工人宁愿搭乘私人的车辆而不坐市府的公共汽车到德班去上工。
    在爆发大示威的卡托马诺尔区，武装警察仍在市府啤酒店门前站岗放哨，三辆装甲车准备随时出动，海军的探照灯天黑以后继续对这个区的四周住满非洲人栅户的群山乱照。这个城市的其他非洲人地区局势也很紧张。
    南非非洲人国民大会计划在26日在全国展开一个抵制支持白人政府的企业和公司的运动，南非联邦当局表示准备进行镇压。联邦司法部长斯瓦特22日在联邦参议院指责非洲人国民大会是“一个危险的组织”。他威胁说，如果非洲人企图“破坏这个国家的法律”，他准备在26日或任何其他时候采取行动。他宣布，司法部已经得到八十辆装甲车供警察使用。
