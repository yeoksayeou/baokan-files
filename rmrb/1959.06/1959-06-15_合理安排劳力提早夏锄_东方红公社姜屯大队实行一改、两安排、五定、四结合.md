This newspaper, Shenyang, June 14th: The Jiangtun Production Brigade of the Dongfanghong People's Commune in Heishan County, Liaoning Province, has been able to conduct summer weeding production quickly and well because it has looked ahead and made comprehensive arrangements for labor during the summer weeding period.

This year, the brigade's summer weeding farm work is very concentrated and technically demanding, so labor is very tight, with an expected shortage of more than 49,000 workdays. In order to solve this problem, the brigade's general branch held a special meeting in mid-May with production team leaders and experienced farmers to study and determine the adoption of "one reform, two arrangements, five fixes, and four combinations" to arrange a comprehensive plan for farm work and organize labor, thereby fundamentally solving the difficulty of insufficient labor.

One reform: Vigorously grasp tool reform. The entire brigade plans to widely use locally-made weeding machines, fertilizer applicators, and handcarts for hoeing, topdressing, and transporting fertilizer, which is expected to save 27,000 workdays.

Two arrangements: The first is to rationally arrange farm work, and the second is to rationally arrange labor. In terms of arranging farm work, change the previous phenomenon of waiting for work during summer weeding and implement two early (early hoeing, early thinning), three no-wait (thinning does not wait for hoeing, weeding does not wait for thinning), and four simultaneous operations (hoeing, thinning, weeding, and topdressing at the same time) to avoid excessive concentration of farm work. On the basis of rationally arranging farm work, rationally arrange labor according to local conditions and people. The brigade decided that during the summer weeding period, male laborers should focus on hoeing, weeding, and irrigation; female laborers should focus on thinning, pruning, and pest control; young and middle-aged laborers should hoe distant fields; and auxiliary laborers should be assigned farm work in nearby fields. In this way, all commune members are satisfied.

In order to further strengthen the responsibility system for summer weeding, it was decided to promote the "five fixes" for groups, namely, fixing plots, fixing tasks, fixing quality, fixing time, and fixing management responsibilities, contracting for field management, and striving for excellence. On the basis of the "five fixes," in order to solve the contradiction of uneven economic crop areas and varying labor input between teams and groups, it was decided to implement a "four combinations" management system. That is, (1) combining teams (groups) with high and low labor input, adopting equal-value exchange, labor-based scoring, or mutual exchange of labor and livestock to support each other; (2) combining mobile shock work with fixed division of labor; (3) combining logistics personnel with field labor, contracting the summer weeding farm work in nearby areas to logistics personnel to complete in their spare time; (4) combining specialized teams (industry, sideline, horticulture) with large field teams. When farm work is tight, specialized teams (except iron and wood workers) are drawn to support agriculture.

After the Jiangtun Brigade implemented the "one reform, two arrangements, five fixes, and four combinations" operation plan, it effectively promoted summer weeding production. The entire brigade started hoeing and weeding about ten days earlier than in previous years, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the month; the quality of hoeing and weeding operations is also very good.

    合理安排劳力提早夏锄
    东方红公社姜屯大队实行一改、两安排、五定、四结合
    本报沈阳14日电　辽宁省黑山县东方红人民公社姜屯生产大队，在夏锄期间由于作到了瞻前顾后，全面安排劳力，夏锄生产进行得又快又好。
    这个队今年夏锄农活很集中，技术性又强，因此劳力很紧张，预计缺少四万九千多个劳动日。为了解决这个问题，大队总支在5月中旬召开了有生产队长和老农参加的专门会议，进行了研究，确定采取“一改、两安排、五定、四结合”的办法，安排了农活和组织劳动力的全面规划，从而劳动力不足的困难得到了基本解决。
    一改，即大抓工具改革。全大队计划广泛运用土制锄草机、追肥器、手推车进行铲趟、追肥和运肥，预计可以节省二万七千个劳动日。
    两安排，一是合理安排农活，二是合理安排劳力，在安排农活方面，改变往年夏锄时活等活的现象，实行两早（早铲、早间苗），三不等（间苗不等铲地、趟地不等间苗），四边作业（边铲、边间、边趟、边追肥）的办法，避免了农活过分集中，在合理安排农活的基础上，再因人因地制宜地合理安排劳力。大队决定：夏锄时期，男劳力以做好铲趟、灌溉为主；女劳力以搞好间苗、整枝、灭虫为主；青壮年锄远地；辅助劳力分给近地农活；这样，社员人人满意。
    为了进一步加强夏锄的责任制，确定推行小组“五定”，即定地段，定任务，定质量，定时间，定管理责任，包干田间管理，做到精益求精。在“五定”的基础上，为了解决队与队、组与组之间经济作物面积多少不均，用工量有多有少的矛盾，决定实行“四结合”的管理制度。即（一）用工多与用工少的队（组）结合，采取等价交换，按劳记分或人畜互相换工的办法，互相支援；（二）机动突击与固定分工相结合；（三）后勤人员与田间劳动结合，把近地的夏锄农活包给后勤人员利用业余时间去完成；（四）专业队（工业、副业、园艺）与大田队结合。在农活紧张时抽调专业队（除铁木工外）支援农业。
    姜屯大队推行“一改、两安排、五定、四结合”的作业规划后，有力地推动了夏锄生产。全大队开始铲趟比往年提早了十天左右，预计月底全部结束；铲趟作业质量也很好。（李哲、赵恒齐）（附图片）
