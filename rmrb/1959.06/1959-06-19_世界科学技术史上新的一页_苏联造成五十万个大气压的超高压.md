    The Soviet Union Creates Ultra-High Pressure of 500,000 Atmospheres

    (Xinhua News Agency) Using high and ultra-high pressure can make pure iron harder than steel without forging, make osmium harder than chromium, turn yellow phosphorus into black phosphorus, and even allow water to penetrate steel plates. Currently, the Institute of High-Pressure Physics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is conducting such experiments and has, for the first time in the history of world science and technology, created an ultra-high pressure of 500,000 atmospheres.

    Not long ago, an article published in the "Moscow Evening News" introduced many achievements of Soviet scientists in researching the use of high pressure and its significance in industrial technology.

    The staff of the Institute of High-Pressure Physics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences are exploring a profound secret of matter: what changes will occur in a substance when subjected to not ordinary, but ultra-high pressure on its surface? The results of this research will allow people to change the structure and properties of matter according to their own wishes.

    Decades ago, French scientists called a pressure of ten atmospheres a "monster." In 1914, the highest pressure that could be created was 250 atmospheres. Later, American scientists obtained a pressure of 50,000 atmospheres in their experiments. However, today the Soviet Union has successfully created an ultra-high pressure of 500,000 atmospheres, which is the first occurrence in the history of world science and technology.

    When this high pressure is applied to various elements, miracles occur, and the original properties of matter change. Iron can become a metal harder than steel without forging.

    The article describes the interesting effects produced by high pressure on matter, stating that the metallic element osmium can become harder than chromium under 50,000 atmospheres of pressure. Under 300,000 atmospheres of pressure, the strength of pure iron can increase tens of thousands of times. Therefore, the study of high pressure will provide valuable technical methods for industry. For example, pure iron treated with high pressure can be used in place of the strongest steel in structures where it is needed.

    Scientists have proven that high pressure can not only change the distance between atoms in a substance but even change the internal structure of the atoms themselves. This allows substances to have new, non-native properties. For example, yellow phosphorus is a non-conductive material, but when subjected to a pressure of 1,000 atmospheres, it turns into another solid, black phosphorus and immediately becomes a conductor.

    Experiments have shown that some metals lose their original brittleness under high pressure and become tougher. Based on this phenomenon, Soviet scientists have developed a unique device that uses water pressure to shape the properties of metals. Currently, this device has been adopted in industry.

    The article mentions that many novel things can be seen in the laboratory of the Institute of High-Pressure Physics. In one laboratory, there is a "water cannon" device that can eject a stream of water as thin as a needle under a pressure of hundreds of atmospheres. This stream of water travels more than twice the speed of sound in the air, and it can penetrate solid thin steel plates within a distance of five centimeters to half a meter.

    The article concludes by pointing out that what has been introduced here is only a part of the work being carried out by the Institute of High-Pressure Physics, and these research efforts will undoubtedly bring about the birth of new future technologies.

    世界科学技术史上新的一页
    苏联造成五十万个大气压的超高压
    据新华社讯　利用高压和超高压可以使纯铁不经锻冶而变得比钢还硬，使锇变得比铬还硬，使黄磷变成黑磷，并且可以使水穿透钢板。目前，苏联科学院高压物理研究所在进行这类试验中，已经在世界科学技术史上第一次地造成了五十万个大气压的超高压。
    不久前，在“莫斯科晚报”发表的一篇文章中，介绍了苏联科学家在研究利用高压方面的许多成果及其在工业技术方面的意义。
    苏联科学院高压物理研究所的工作人员正在探索着物质的一个深奥秘密，即当在物质表面上施加不是一般的，而是超高压力的时候，物质会产生怎样的变化？这种研究的结果将会使人按照自己的意愿来改变物质的结构和性能。
    在几十年前，法国的科学家曾把十个大气压的压力称作“怪物”，1914年人们所能造出的压力，最高是二百五十个大气压，后来，美国的科学家在自己的试验中获得了五万个大气压的压力，但是，今天苏联已经成功地造成了五十万个大气压的超高压，这还是世界科学技术史上第一次出现的事。
    当这种高压作用于各种不同的元素时，奇迹出现了，物质的原本性能改变了，铁竟会不经过锻冶而变成比钢还硬的金属。
    文章在介绍高压作用于物质所产生的有趣的效果时说，如金属元素锇，在五万个大气压之下能变得比铬还要坚硬。在三十万个大气压力下，纯铁的坚固强度会提高几万倍。因此，对高压的研究将给工业提供宝贵的技术方法，例如，在需要使用最坚固的钢材的结构中，即可用经过高压处理的纯铁代替。
    科学家实验证明：高压不仅能使物质原子间的距离改变，甚至还能改变原子本身的内部结构。这样，就可以使物质具有非原生的，新的性质。例如，黄磷是不导电的物质，但当它受到一千个大气压的压力时，就会变成另一种结实的黑磷，而且立即会变成导电体。
    在实验中证明，某些金属在高压下会失去原有的脆弱性，而变得坚韧起来。根据这一现象，苏联科学家已经制成了一种利用水的压力来塑造金属性质的奇特的装置。目前，这种装置已在工业中采用。
    文章介绍说，在高压物理研究所的实验室里，可以看到很多新奇的事物。在一所实验室中，有一种“水炮”装置，它能使水在几百个大气压的压力下喷出像针一样粗的水流，这水流的速度比空气中的音速还快一倍多，它可以在五公分到半公尺的距离内穿透坚固的薄钢板。
    文章在结束时指出，这里所介绍的仅是高压物理研究所所进行的工作的一部分，这一些研究工作必将会带来新的未来技术的诞生。
