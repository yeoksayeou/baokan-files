Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th: The strike of 200,000 British printing workers began tonight.

The strikers are demanding a 10% wage increase and a reduction in working hours. However, their demands were rejected by the Federation of Master Printers, which represents the vast majority of employers.

The strike affects approximately 4,300 printing plants, and more than half of the country's printed matter, including thousands of local newspapers and hundreds of national publications, will be suspended as a result. Two thousand printing ink workers are also currently brewing a strike.

In addition, workers in other industrial sectors in Britain are also fighting to defend their rights.

1,750 boilermakers at the Birkenhead Shipyard have been on strike for seven weeks and are still persisting in their struggle.

In the automotive industry, the struggle between workers and capitalists is very fierce. Two hundred and fifty vehicle manufacturing workers at the Rover car factory in Birmingham are on strike to protest the unreasonable measures taken by the capitalists on piecework wages. At the British Motor Corporation's Birmingham body plant, six hundred crane operators and drivers have gone on strike.

Railway workers have also launched a fierce struggle with the management.

    英国罢工斗争高涨
    印刷造船等业工人纷纷停工
    新华社伦敦17日电　二十万英国印刷工人从今天晚上起开始罢工。
    罢工者要求提高工资10％和缩短工作时间。但是，他们的要求遭到了代表绝大部分雇主的大印刷商联合会的拒绝。
    这次罢工影响到约四千三百个印刷厂，全国半数以上的印刷品，其中包括数千种地方报纸和数百种全国性刊物，都要因此停止出版。两千名印刷油墨工人目前也正在酝酿罢工。
    此外，在英国的其他一些工业部门中，工人们也正在为维护他们的权利而斗争。
    柏肯黑德造船厂一千七百五十名锅炉制造工人已经罢工七周，目前仍然在坚持斗争。
    在汽车工业，工人和资本家的斗争非常剧烈。伯明翰罗弗汽车工厂有二百五十名车辆制造工人罢工，抗议资方在计件工资问题上的无理措施。在英国汽车公司的伯明翰车身工厂，有六百名起重机工人和司机举行了罢工。
    铁路工人也和管理当局展开了强烈的斗争。
