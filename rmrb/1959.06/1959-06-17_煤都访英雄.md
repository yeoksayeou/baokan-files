Visiting a Hero in the Coal Capital
By Our Correspondent Qu Jitao

The ancient Bulgarian coal capital of Dimitrovo attracts visitors from home and abroad. Everyone who has been here remembers the outstanding contributions made by Bulgaria's miners to the country's socialist construction.

Recently, we visited Comrade S. Aleksov, an ordinary miner and "Socialist Labor Hero" at the "Dimitrov" mine in this coal capital, with a feeling of respect.

	A Man Who Fears No Difficulty

In the miner's residential area, with its fresh air and beautiful scenery, we visited Aleksov's family and learned a lot about Aleksov's advanced deeds from other miners.

Aleksov is in his forties, of medium build, with broad shoulders, thick eyebrows and big eyes, and speaks in a kind and friendly manner. People in the coal mine say that one of Aleksov's greatest advantages is that he is not afraid of difficulties. He often takes the initiative to ask the leadership to work in the most difficult places and has never left the mine without exceeding the production quota.

Since Bulgaria's liberation in 1944, he and his assistants have often completed more than 140% of the prescribed production quota, and the highest was 480%.

There are various working areas in the mine: some are dry and spacious, some are damp and narrow, and some have accumulated water. One day in 1950, water suddenly appeared in a tunnel in the mine, up to the chest, and people called it the "flood" tunnel. At that time, there were only two ways out: abandon the tunnel and stop mining, or continue mining in the water while digging through an old tunnel to discharge the water. The difficulty of continuing to mine in this tunnel can be imagined. But the difficulty did not scare Aleksov. After obtaining the consent of his assistants, he was the first to sign up to cure this "flood" tunnel. He expressed his determination: "Never give up a piece of 'black gold'!"

The struggle in the "flood" tunnel began. Aleksov and his assistants worked in the water for eight hours every day: standing in the cold water, drilling holes, blasting, loading coal pieces by piece onto coal carts from the water, and erecting tunnel supports... Aleksov and his assistants worked under such difficult conditions for a full seventeen days, mining ten tons of coal every day, without complaining once.

Since then, comrades have praised Aleksov as a man who is not afraid of difficulties.

	Good Mentor

Loving and patiently training apprentices is another of Aleksov's communist virtues. He has a firm belief: there are no bad apprentices, as long as the master is patient and the apprentice studies hard, every apprentice can become a coal mining expert. Since the liberation of Bulgaria, he has trained more than thirty excellent miners for the country.

Comrades at the coal mine told us a moving story: back in the early days of Bulgaria's liberation, a young man named Dimitrov came to the mine as an apprentice. He had a strange problem: as soon as he entered the hot tunnel, he would lean against the tunnel wall and fall asleep. Although he was criticized repeatedly, he did not improve much, and he was also aloof and did not like to talk. All the masters who had taught him said that he was a lazy man and it would be difficult to train him into a good miner. After Aleksov learned about this, he asked the leadership: "Transfer this young man to me and let me try." The leadership agreed.

Aleksov thought to himself: "The fact that this young man falls asleep as soon as he enters the tunnel shows that he has no interest in the work at all. We must first find out the reason why he is not interested in the work."

So, Aleksov decided that for the first few days, he would not let Dimitrov do any work, but only chat with him intimately about his family. At first, Dimitrov didn't care when talking, and still dozed off in the tunnel as before. When he fell asleep, Aleksov did not disturb him. When he woke up, Aleksov took the initiative to find topics to talk to him about. After this patient and repeated conversation, Aleksov finally understood the main reasons for Dimitrov's aloofness, depression, and lack of interest in work. It turned out that Dimitrov's mother had died when he was young, and he had been abused by his stepmother. Although this happened before liberation, it was deeply imprinted in Dimitrov's heart, and he looked at everything with indifference.

In response to this situation, in addition to taking care of and caring for Dimitrov in life like a son, Aleksov also often told Dimitrov about his personal experiences of the completely different life scenes before and after the liberation of Bulgaria, talking about the wonderful present and the even happier future - communism. Under Aleksov's painstaking help and the care organized by the mine, the young man gradually realized the warmth of the big family. Dimitrov no longer slept in the tunnel, and later became a production expert.

When we talked about Aleksov with the miners, they all said that he was a good mentor.

	Always Moving Forward

Because of his good work, high awareness, and concern for others, Aleksov has successively received the Gold and Silver Labor Red Banner Medals and the title of "Socialist Labor Hero." In early April of this year, he was elected as a member of the Dimitrovo Township People's Committee. Aleksov felt supremely honored that he joined the vanguard of the Bulgarian working class - the Bulgarian Communist Party - in 1951.

We asked Aleksov: "Why do you work so hard without fear of difficulties and care for others?" Aleksov smiled and replied: "It's very simple. You only need to understand the changes in my life before and after liberation to understand."

Before and after liberation, Aleksov's life was vastly different. In the past, because his family was poor, he only attended primary school for four years, and he was often unemployed and hungry. Now he has three children, the oldest of whom has graduated from university and is an engineer working with him in the same mine. The other two, one is about to graduate from middle school and the other is serving in the military. In the beautiful miner's residential area, a new house for Aleksov's family is under construction, the cost of which is his savings of more than ten years and a state loan.

Aleksov finally told us that he would never be complacent with his achievements and would devote himself to the great movement of "completing the Five-Year Plan in three or four years" with new strength, mining more and better "black gold" for the country.

### 煤都访英雄

    煤都访英雄
    本报记者　曲季涛
    保加利亚古老的煤都季米特洛沃市，吸引着来自国内外各地的客人。到这里来过的人都念念不忘保加利亚的矿工们对祖国的社会主义建设作出的杰出贡献。
    最近，我们怀着崇敬的心情访问了这个煤都的“季米特洛夫”矿井的普通矿工、“社会主义劳动英雄”斯·阿列克索夫。
            不怕困难的人
    在空气新鲜、风景优美的矿工居住区，我们访问了阿列克索夫的家庭，并且从其他矿工的口中了解到很多关于阿列克索夫的先进事迹。
    阿列克索夫四十多岁，中等身材，宽肩膀，粗眉大眼，说起话来和蔼可亲。煤矿上的人们说，阿列克索夫的一个最大的优点是不怕困难，经常主动向领导上要求到最困难的地方工作，从来没有在不超额完成生产定额时走出过矿井。
    从1944年保加利亚解放后到现在，他和他的助手经常完成规定的生产定额的140％以上，最高曾达480％。
    矿井里有各种不同的工作区：有的地方干燥宽畅，有的地方潮湿狭小，有的地方还有积水。1950年的一天，矿井中的一个坑道里，突然出现了水，深至胸脯，人们都说这是“洪水”坑道。当时，只有两条出路：放弃这个坑道不再继续采煤，或者是一面在水中继续采煤，一面与一旧坑道挖通，把水放到那里去。继续在这个坑道里采煤的困难是可以想像的。但是困难并没有吓倒阿列克索夫。在征得他的助手同意后，他就第一个报名要治好这个“洪水”坑道。他表示决心说：“决不放弃一块‘黑金子’！”
    “洪水”坑道里的斗争开始了。阿列克索夫和他的助手每天站在水中工作八小时：站在冰冷的水中打眼、爆破、从水中把煤一块块地装到煤车上、架设坑道撑木……。阿列克索夫和他的助手就是在这样的困难条件下，整整工作了十七天，每天采煤十吨，自始至终没有叫过一声苦。
    从这以后，同志们都赞扬阿列克索夫是个不怕困难的人。
              好师傅
    热爱和耐心培养学徒是阿列克索夫的另一种共产主义的美德。他有一个坚强的信念：没有不好的学徒，只要师傅耐心，徒弟苦学，每个学徒都能成为采煤能手。自从保加利亚解放以来，他已经为祖国培养了三十多个优秀矿工。
    煤矿上的同志们给我们讲述了一个动人的故事：还是在保加利亚解放初期，一个叫杰米特洛夫的年轻小伙子，来到矿上当学徒。他有个怪毛病：一下到热呼呼的坑道里，就要靠在坑道壁上睡觉，虽然一再批评，但是改正不多，而且性情孤僻，不爱讲话。凡是带过他的师傅都说他是个懒汉，很难培养成好矿工。阿列克索夫知道了这件事以后，就向领导上要求说：“把这个小伙子调给我试试看”。领导上答应了。
    阿列克索夫心里想：“这个小伙子一下坑道就瞌睡这件事，说明他对工作根本一点兴趣都没有，必须先找出他对工作不感兴趣的原因来。”
    于是，阿列克索夫决定，开始几天什么活也不要杰米特洛夫干，只跟他亲热地谈家常。起初，谈着话，杰米特洛夫也不在意，仍然同过去一样，坐在坑道里打瞌睡。他睡着了，阿列克索夫也不去打扰他。他睡醒了，阿列克索夫就主动找话跟他谈。经过这种耐心、反复的多次交谈，阿列克索夫终于了解到杰米特洛夫孤僻沉闷和对工作不感兴趣的主要原因。原来杰米特洛夫从小就死去了母亲，曾遭受过后母的虐待。虽然这是解放前发生的事，但是却深深地印在杰米特洛夫的心灵深处，他对一切都漠然视之。
    针对这一情况，阿列克索夫除了在生活上像对待儿子一样照顾和关心杰米特洛夫之外，还经常给杰米特洛夫讲述一些他在保加利亚解放前后亲身经历的截然不同的生活情景，谈到美好的今天和更加幸福的未来——共产主义。阿列克索夫的这种苦口婆心的帮助和在矿上组织的关怀下，小伙子逐渐体会到了大家庭的温暖。杰米特洛夫再也不在坑道里睡觉了，后来还成了生产能手。
    我们与矿工们谈起阿列克索夫的时候，都说他是一个好师傅。
              永远前进
    由于工作好，觉悟高，关心别人，阿列克索夫先后得到过金质、银质劳动红旗勋章和“社会主义劳动英雄”称号。今年4月初，他当选为季米特洛沃乡人民委员会委员。阿列克索夫感到无尚光荣的是，他于1951年加入了保加利亚工人阶级的先锋队——保加利亚共产党。
    我们问阿列克索夫：“为什么你这样不怕困难的工作，关心别人？”阿列克索夫微笑着回答说：“这很简单，你们只要了解一下我的生活在解放前后的变化，就明白了。”
    解放前后，阿列克索夫的生活有着天渊之别。过去因为家里穷，他只上过四年小学，经常失业、挨饿，现在他有三个孩子，最大的已大学毕业，是工程师，跟他在一个矿上工作。另外两个，一个中学快毕业了，一个正服兵役。在环境优美的矿工居住区里，阿列克索夫家一幢新居正在修建，费用是他十几年来的积蓄和国家贷款。
    阿列克索夫最后对我们说，他绝不因已有的成就而自满，他将以新的力量投入“三、四年完成五年计划”的伟大运动，为祖国开采更多更好的“黑金子”。
