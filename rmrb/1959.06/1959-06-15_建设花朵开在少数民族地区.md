    Construction Flowers Blossom in Minority Areas
    Bus Reaches Guiyang Through Miao Mountains
    Guizhou Minority Areas Build Mountain Highway Network
    This year, with the help of the state, the Miao, Buyi, Dong and other ethnic minorities living in the mountains of Guizhou Province have built more than 20 new highways with a total length of more than 500 kilometers.
    Before liberation, there were only more than 800 kilometers of highways in the minority areas of Guizhou Province. Most areas were not accessible by car, and the transportation of supplies relied entirely on human and animal power. After liberation, with the vigorous help of the state, dozens of highways have been built, with a total length of more than 4,600 kilometers, connecting the minority areas with Guiyang City, the provincial capital. For example, the Miao people living in the Leishan area on the main peak of the Miao Mountains used to find it very difficult to contact the outside world. After the construction of the Lu (shan) Lei (shan) Rong (jiang) Highway, the Miao people here can take a bus directly to Guiyang. Now, every county in the minority areas of the province is accessible by car. In addition to the newly built highways in other parts of the province, a mountain highway network with Guiyang City as the center and the four major trunk lines of Sichuan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guizhou, Hunan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Guangxi as the main lines has been basically formed.
    The construction of the mountain highway network has played an important role in developing production and promoting material exchange in minority areas.
    Inner Mongolia Expands a Mica Mine
    The Tuqi Wula Mine in Inner Mongolia, one of China's large mica mines, recently began expansion. After the completion of the expansion project, the annual output of mica from Tuqi Wula Mine will be more than three times higher than last year.
    Ningxia Has a Shipyard
    The first ship repair and building factory newly built in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has recently been put into production.
    This ship repair and building factory is built on the Shizuishan Wharf on the west bank of the Yellow River. It is now manufacturing new wooden barges, which are thicker than old wooden boats, have a shallower draft, and are strong in structure. The boats are equipped with a wheelhouse, a covered cargo hold, a kitchen, and crew cabins.
    At present, the transportation task on the Yellow River in Ningxia is borne by some ancient wooden boats. After the completion of the new ship repair and building factory, the backwardness of transportation on the Yellow River in Ningxia will be gradually changed.
    Helping Ethnic Minorities Run Industries
    The Ministry of Light Industry recently organized a social-run industrial work group of more than 40 people to go to the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which is rich in mineral resources, to help local people's communes and ethnic minorities develop light industry. The members of this work group include engineers, technical cadres, and students from industrial schools in various provinces. In a month and a half, they helped Kaili County restore and build more than 1,000 small factories (an average of four small factories per production team). With the help of the work group, Panghai People's Commune in this county has increased the production of 26 kinds of products such as milk substitutes, starch, bacterial fertilizers, and ferrous sulfate.

### 建设花朵开在少数民族地区

    建设花朵开在少数民族地区
    苗岭汽车通贵阳
    贵州少数民族地区建成山区公路网
    居住在贵州省崇山峻岭中的苗、布依、侗等少数民族人民，今年以来在国家的帮助下，又新建了二十多条、总长五百多公里的公路。
    贵州省少数民族地区解放前只有八百多公里长的公路，绝大部分地区不通汽车，运输物资全靠人背马驮。解放后，在国家的大力帮助下，先后修起了几十条公路，共长四千六百多公里，已使少数民族地区和省会贵阳市联系起来。如苗岭山脉主峰上的雷山地区居住的苗民，过去和外地联系很不容易，修起了炉（山）雷（山）榕（江）公路以后，这里的苗族人民就可以坐着汽车一直到贵阳。现在，全省少数民族地区已经县县通汽车，加上全省其他地区新建的公路，基本上构成了一个以贵阳市为中心，以川黔、滇黔、湘黔和黔桂四大干线为主干的山区公路网。
    山区公路网的建设，对发展少数民族地区生产和促进物资交流起了重要作用。
    内蒙古扩建一个云母矿
    我国大型云母矿之一的内蒙古土圭乌拉矿，最近动工扩建。扩建工程竣工后，土圭乌拉矿的云母年产量将比去年提高三倍多。
    宁夏有了造船厂
    宁夏回族自治区新建的第一座船舶修造厂已在最近投入生产。
    这座船舶修造厂建设在黄河西岸石嘴山码头上。现在正在制造新式木驳船，这种船比旧式木船板厚、吃水浅、结构坚固，船上设有驾驶室，货舱设有盖子，船上还有厨房和船员卧室。
    目前在宁夏境内黄河上担负运输任务的，都是些古老的木船。新的船舶修造厂建成以后，将逐步地改变宁夏境内黄河运输上的落后面貌。
    帮助少数民族办工业
    中央轻工业部，不久前组织了一个四十多人的社办工业工作组，前往矿藏资源丰富的黔东南苗族侗族自治州，帮助当地人民公社、少数民族发展轻工业。这个工作组的成员有工程师、技术干部和各省工业学校的学生等。他们在一个半月的时间内，帮助凯里县恢复和新建了一千多个小型工厂（平均每个生产队都有四个小工厂）。这个县旁海人民公社在工作组的帮助下，已经增加了代乳粉、淀粉、细菌肥料、硫酸铁等二十六种产品的生产。
