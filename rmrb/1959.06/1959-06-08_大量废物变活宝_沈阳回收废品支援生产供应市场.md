    Turning Large Quantities of Waste into Treasure
    Shenyang Recycles Waste Products to Support Production and Supply the Market
    (Our newspaper's Shenyang dispatch, 7th) The Shenyang Municipal Waste Products Recycling Department is implementing the acquisition policy of "seizing both large and small items, considering both primary and secondary items, making overall arrangements, and ensuring the effectiveness of each aspect." With the waste materials recycling departments as the main force, supplemented by the organization of comprehensive stores and people's communes to collect and purchase on their behalf, they have adopted a method combining mobile acquisition with fixed acquisition, and combining the acquisition of waste products with door-to-door delivery. They are vigorously carrying out a waste product recycling campaign, powerfully supporting current industrial and agricultural production and adjusting market needs.
    In order to extensively and deeply tap the potential of various waste products in society and overcome the current difficulties of insufficient raw materials for some industries, the city's more than 3,500 waste product recycling personnel have been conducting a concentrated campaign to recover waste products in various streets since March 20th. By the end of May, various waste materials worth 6.6 million yuan had been recovered, exceeding the original plan by 44.8%, and increasing by 1.3 times compared with the same period last year. The types of waste products recovered reached more than 20,000, an increase of more than 5,000 compared with the past. During this concentrated acquisition campaign, the recovery of only eighteen major varieties such as copper, scrap steel, lead, aluminum, waste cotton, and rags reached more than 9,800 tons. These waste materials are all urgently needed raw materials for current industrial production. In order to make these items available to various industrial production departments in a timely manner, except for a portion of the first and second category materials under the unified control of the state that were turned over, the majority of the materials were adopted with the method of collection, allocation, and transportation, and some were directly processed and replicated, and timely supplied to factories, enterprises and other production units. According to statistics, in April alone, 890 tons of waste paper were supplied to Yongchang, Qixin, and Shenyang Paper Mill, more than 180 tons of waste rubber was supplied to Xinsheng Rubber Factory, and more than 1,020 tons of waste steel, lead, tin, aluminum, etc., were supplied to mechanical industry, light industry, metallurgical industry, iron industry, farm tool factories, community-run industries, and work-study programs. Many purchasing personnel also helped production units overcome special difficulties. Many small varieties, such as bottle caps, toothpaste caps, and shoe polish trays, were not recycled in the past; recently, because some factories needed them, they were also included in the recycling varieties.
    In order to further meet the current market needs, the Shenyang Municipal Waste Materials Company has also established many waste product processing plants in various districts to directly process, replicate, and renovate some of the better old items that have been recovered. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 30,000 pairs of various shoes, more than 58,000 pairs of gloves and hand warmers, and more than 10,000 mops have been processed. In addition, many daily necessities have been processed, replicated, and renovated, and they have been put on the market in a timely manner to meet consumer needs.
    In order to make the city's residents aware of the significance of national waste product recycling and the types of recycled products, the Shenyang Municipal Waste Product Recycling Department used various forms to launch publicity activities in advance. After some residents learned about the types of waste products that the country recycles, they saved the waste products they used and sold them regularly, and actively promoted them to the surrounding people.
    In terms of acquisition methods, the Shenyang Municipal Waste Product Recycling Department, based on the characteristics of waste products being scattered, diverse in variety, and widely distributed, tried its best to start from the convenience of the masses in acquiring waste products. On the basis of professional acquisition by waste material management departments in the past, it gave full play to the role of comprehensive stores and people's communes. More than 350 mobile and fixed recycling points have been newly established throughout the city. In addition, a large number of voluntary purchasing agents have been developed in many factories, government agencies, hospitals, and service industries. With regard to the time for acquiring waste products, they took into consideration that urban workers and residents have many daytime working hours and no time, and used early mornings, evenings, and weekends to acquire waste products door-to-door. The recycling department also correctly implemented the policy of pricing according to quality. Some waste products were evaluated using a democratic evaluation method, and all of them were re-priced when they were delivered to the station to make them as reasonable as possible. These measures have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to sell waste products. (Picture attached)

    大量废物变活宝
    沈阳回收废品支援生产供应市场
    本报沈阳7日电　沈阳市废品回收部门贯彻“大小都抓、主次兼顾、统筹安排、各收其效”的收购方针，以废旧物资回收部门为主，以组织综合商店和人民公社代收代购为辅，采取了游动收购与固定收购相结合和收购废品与送货到门相结合的方法，大力开展废品回收突击运动，有力地支援了当前工农业生产和调剂了市场需要。
    为了广泛深入地挖掘社会上各种废品的潜力，克服当前某些工业原材料不足的困难，从3月20日开始，全市三千五百多名废品回收人员，深入各个街道突击回收废品。到5月底止，已经回收的各种废旧物资价值六百六十万元，超过原订计划44.8％，比去年同期增加一点三倍。回收的废品种类达到了两万多种，比以前也增加了五千多种。在这次突击收购运动中，仅回收的铜、废钢铁、铅、铝、废棉、破布等十八个主要品种即达九千八百多吨。这些废旧物品，都是目前工业生产急需的原材料。为了使这些物品及时支援各工业生产部门，除一部分属于国家统一掌握的一、二类物资上缴外，其余大部分物资，采取了随收随调拨随运的办法，有些并直接加工、复制，及时供给了各工厂、企业等生产单位。据统计，仅4月份一个月即供给永昌、启新和沈阳造纸厂废纸八百九十吨，供给新生橡胶厂废橡胶一百八十多吨，供给机械工业、轻工业、冶金工业、铁工业、农具厂、社办工业和勤工俭学等生产单位废钢铁、铅、锡、铝等一千零二十多吨。许多收购人员，还帮助生产单位克服特殊的困难。像瓶盖、牙膏盖、鞋油盘等很多小的品种，过去都不回收；最近，因为某些工厂需要，也列入了回收品种之一。
    为了进一步满足当前市场需要，沈阳市废旧物公司在各个区还设立了很多废品加工厂，把回收来的一部分较好的旧物品，直接加工、复制和翻新。据不完全统计，经过加工的各种鞋就有近三万双，手套、手闷子五万八千多副，墩布一万多把。此外，还加工、复制和翻新了很多日常生活用品，及时投到了市场，供应消费者需要。
    沈阳市废品回收部门为了使全市居民知道国家回收废品的意义和回收品种，事先利用各种形式展开了宣传活动。有些居民知道了国家回收废品的种类以后，把自己用过的废品积攒起来定期出卖，还主动向附近群众宣传。
    在收购方法上，沈阳市废品回收部门根据废品零星分散、品种繁多、分布面广的特点，收购废品尽量从便利群众出发，在过去废旧物经营部门专业收购的基础上，发挥了综合商店和人民公社的作用，全市又新增设了三百五十多个游动和固定回收点。此外，还在很多工厂、机关、医院和服务性行业等发展了大批的义务代购员。收购废品的时间，他们针对城市职工住户多，白天上班没有时间的情况，利用早晚和星期假日挨门逐户收购。回收部门还正确贯彻了按质论价的政策。有些废品在评价时，采取了民主评议的办法，而且回站交货时，要全部进行一次复价，尽量做到合理。这些措施，都大大鼓励了群众出售废品的积极性。（附图片）
