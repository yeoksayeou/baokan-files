    Buying, Selling, and Repair Services
    Xiao Lin
    When people are sick, they need treatment; when machines break down, they need repair; and if the daily necessities in people's lives are damaged, they should be repaired if possible.
    In 1958, China's industrial and agricultural production saw a great leap forward. However, with the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the growth of commodity production cannot fully keep up with consumption needs, and this contradiction cannot be completely resolved in the short term. To meet consumption needs, the state and the people are doing everything possible to increase production, and commercial departments are rationally allocating and transporting goods. These are fundamental and will continue to play a major role in market supply. However, the rational use and repair/replacement of goods cannot be ignored. Because the old, broken, and damaged items in the hands of residents, after proper repair, can not only extend their service life and save residents' expenses, but also increase the utility of materials and reduce market supply.
    The attention paid by Shanghai's commercial departments to developing repair services is welcomed by residents, and this is not accidental. It is certainly important for commercial personnel to carefully calculate for consumers when selling goods, guiding them to understand the performance of the goods, and to achieve rational use and proper maintenance. However, from the residents' point of view, if items are broken and there is no place to repair them, or if parts are missing and there is no place to replace them, they will still feel inconvenienced. Under the leadership of the Party, Shanghai's commercial departments recognized the importance of repair services and launched various repair activities. Stores that had discontinued repair services resumed their original business, and some stores that previously only sold goods added new repair projects. In terms of service methods, based on the different characteristics of industries and commodities, and starting from the convenience of residents, they adopted fixed locations and long-term service; designated registration and door-to-door service; fixed time and location, service in neighborhoods; decentralized acceptance and centralized repair; street-to-street and lane-to-lane mobile service, and so on. Some shop assistants, combined with their own business, have also learned some general repair techniques, acting as both salespersons and repairmen. In the process of carrying out repair services, they try every means to facilitate residents. Facts have proved that doing so meets the needs of residents and is correct.
    Some people think that repair service work is a "trivial" matter, and there is no need to go to so much trouble; others think that engaging in repair and patching up work is "not honorable"; and some store staff are worried that carrying out repair services will affect the company's profits, fearing that it will be "not worth the loss." These views are wrong. Repairs and patching seem like small things, but they are related to people's lives and the quality of service provided by commercial departments. People have diverse needs, and commercial services should also be diverse. Developing repair services is one of the ways to improve service quality. Residents feel convenience in life, and will be more motivated in production and work. Serving the residents' lives is also serving production and construction, serving production and consumption, which is the fundamental purpose of socialist commerce.
    With the development of social production, the level of social consumption will gradually increase, and people will have more demands on commercial work. How commercial workers can go all out to meet the requirements of the state and the people is a serious political task. At present, commercial workers all over the country are working hard, practically, and cleverly on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, studying business operations, studying repair techniques, and wholeheartedly serving the masses better. The development of repair services by commercial departments in Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin and other places is a concrete manifestation of this effort.
    It is hoped that commercial departments will better assist people in organizing their economic life, so that commercial work and the people will be united, and greater achievements will be made in commercial work.

    买卖和修配
    肖林
    人病了要治疗，机器坏了要修理，人们生活中的日常用具，如果坏了，能修理好的也要加以修补。
    1958年我国工农业生产有很大的跃进。但是随着人民生活不断的提高，商品生产的增长还不能完全赶上消费需要，这个矛盾，不是短期所能完全解决的。为了满足消费需要，国家和人民群众千方百计增加生产，商业部门合理分配和调运商品，这些都是基本的，对市场供应仍将起主要作用。但是，也不能忽略商品的合理使用和修补配换工作。因为居民手中旧的、破的、坏的、物品，经过妥善的修配，不仅可以延长使用时间，节约居民开支，而且增加了物资效用，减少了市场供应。
    上海商业部门注意开展修配业务，受到居民欢迎，这不是偶然的。商业人员在出售商品的时候，为消费者精打细算，指导消费者了解商品性能，做到合理使用和妥善保养，这固然很重要；不过，从居民来看，如果物品坏了，没地方修理，零件缺了，没地方配换，仍然会感到不便。上海商业部门在党的领导下认识了修配业务的重要意义，开展了各种修配活动，中断修配业务的商店恢复了原有业务，一些过去只出售商品的商店有的也新添了修配项目。在服务方式方面，根据行业和商品的不同特点，从便利居民出发，分别采用了固定地点、长驻服务；定点登记，上门服务；定时定点，下里弄服务；分散承接，集中修理；串街走巷，流动服务等等。有些商店的营业员，结合本身业务，也学会了一些一般的修理技术，既是营业员，又是修理员。在开展修配业务的过程中，想尽一切办法便利居民。事实证明：这样做是符合居民要求的，是正确的。
    有人认为修配服务工作是“微不足道”的小事情，何必多此一举；也有人认为干修修配配、缝缝补补的行当“不光彩”；还有些商店的工作人员担心开展修配服务工作会影响企业的利润，怕“得不偿失”。这些看法是错误的。修修配配，看来事小，但是和人民生活有关，和商业部门服务质量好坏有关。人民需要多种多样，商业服务也应该多种多样。开展修配业务，就是提高服务质量的方法之一。居民在生活上感到便利，在生产上在工作中的劲头会更大。商业工作者为居民生活服务，也是为生产建设服务、为生产为消费服务，这是社会主义商业的根本目的。
    随着社会生产的发展，社会消费水平将会逐步提高，人民对商业工作的要求也会更多，商业工作者如何鼓足干劲，满足国家和人民的要求，这是一项严重的政治任务。目前全国各地商业工作者正在去年大跃进的基础上，苦干实干巧干，钻研经营业务，钻研修理技术，一心为群众服务得更好。上海、武汉、天津等地商业部门发展修配业务，正是这种努力的一个具体表现。
    希望商业部门更好地协助人们组织经济生活，使商业工作和人民群众打成一片，在商业工作上取得更大的成就。
