　　The matter of going to town
　　Lin Bi
　　　　No need, no going to town,
　　　　Go to town, come back early.
　　This is a slogan on the wall in Chongyi Township, Xinfan County, Sichuan. Each of the ten large characters is about three or four feet square, and people can see them from afar before they even enter the town.
　　Large-character slogans are a common sight. Whether in factories and mines, people's communes, or government offices and schools, one can often see large slogans that inspire and encourage. When people encounter difficulties, they look up at those slogans and naturally gain strength. As for the way eastern Sichuan put "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" in large characters on the mountain slopes along the river, stretching for several miles, attracting the attention of every traveler on the Sichuan River, that adds even more beauty to the landscape.
　　The slogan in Xinfan County gives people a different feeling. It is different from those soaring slogans calling for production. These few words also contain rich content, yet they are so gentle and moving. When people see this slogan, they seem to see a Party secretary or a commune leader who is completely integrated with the masses, sitting on the ground, chatting with everyone. After a good harvest, with increased income, feeling happy, and after labor, wanting to stroll into town, or, in Sichuan dialect, to find a few buddies to "摆龙门阵" [shoot the breeze], is a very natural thing, and no one objects. However, when you see that slogan, it's as if a well-meaning comrade is advising you: "Brother, if there's nothing to do, isn't it better to go home early? Rest, read the newspaper, listen to the radio at the club, play chess, isn't that more interesting than wandering around the streets? What do you think?"
　　Looking at it this way, thinking about it this way, you will walk back with a feeling of warmth and gratitude. You will also think: The Party is truly more concerned about us than our own mothers, teaching us how to arrange production and also teaching us how to arrange our own lives. Besides, isn't the farm work busy right now? Workers, students, and cadres from the city are even rushing down to help with the harvest. Time is truly precious!
　　Leaders grasping production and caring about production is one of the important factors in ensuring the great leap forward in production; grasping life and caring about the lives of the masses is also one of the important factors in ensuring the great leap forward in production. Don't people often call leaders "heads of the household"? As the head of the household, one must manage everything, including small matters like going to town.

    上街的事
    林碧
        无事不上街，
        上街早回来。
    这是四川新繁县崇义乡墙壁上的一条标语。十个大字，每个字大约有三、四尺见方，人们还没进街，老远就能看得到。
    大字标语，这是人人见惯了的。无论在工厂矿山，人民公社，或是机关学校，经常能看到激励人心、鼓舞斗志的大幅标语。人们当碰到困难的时候，抬头望望那些标语，就会自然而然增加一股劲头。至于像川东那样，把“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”用大字写在临江山坡上，绵亘达几里之遥，使川江上过往旅客人人注目，那更是为江山增色不少了。
    新繁县的这条标语，给人的是另外一种感觉。它不同于那些号召生产的壮志凌云的口号，寥寥十个字，同样也包含着丰富的内容，而又那么娓娓动听，亲切动人。人们看到这条标语，仿佛见到一位同群众完全打成一片的党委书记或是公社社长，坐在地头上跟大家话家常。丰收了，收入增加了，心怀舒畅了，在劳动以后，想上街蹓跶蹓跶，用四川话说，找几位哥子摆摆龙门阵，这是很自然的事，谁也不反对。可是，你一看到那一幅标语，就像有位好心的同志在那边劝着了：“大哥呀，没有什么事，早点回家不更好吗？休息休息，看看报，到俱乐部听听收音机，下下棋，不比在街上闲荡更有意思吗？你看对不对呢？”
    这么一看，这么一想，你就会怀着一种温暖和感激的心情往回走了。你也就会想：党呀，你真是比亲娘还关心我们，教我们学会怎样安排生产，还教我们学会怎样安排自己的生活。再说，现在农活不是忙得紧，人家城里的工人、学生、干部还赶下来帮忙收割哩，时间可真是个宝啊！
    领导人抓生产、关心生产，是保证生产大跃进的重要因素之一；抓生活，关心群众生活，同样也是保证生产大跃进的重要因素之一。人们不是经常把领导人称为“当家人”吗？既是当家人，就得样样都管，包括像上街这样的小事。
