Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest News: This reporter reports: A movement to vigorously develop water conservancy and improve soil is unfolding throughout Romania. In the past three months alone, irrigated land has drastically increased by 58,000 hectares, equivalent to 58% of the country's total irrigated area last year.

Since the beginning of spring this year, hundreds of thousands of farmers, soldiers, and office workers across the country have been working selflessly on construction sites, fighting to overcome natural disasters and increase agricultural production. In addition to the already increased 58,000 hectares of irrigated land, water conservancy projects expected to irrigate 25,000 hectares of land will also be completed soon. At that time, the task of increasing the irrigated area by 78,000 hectares this year, proposed by the Romanian Council of Ministers, will be exceeded by 6.4%.

However, the workers of state farms and the masses of farmers are not satisfied with this. They will continue to launch a new battle to build water conservancy projects after the summer harvest, planning to expand the irrigated area by at least another 19,000 hectares, that is, to double the country's irrigated area this year.

In the past, 1.2 million hectares of farmland in Romania suffered from the floods of the Danube River, and only 3,000 to 4,000 hectares of farmland could be irrigated with the river water. The water conservancy projects built this year will enable the Danube River to irrigate approximately 20,000 hectares of farmland. More water conservancy projects are planned to be built in the future so that the Danube River can serve a large amount of farmland.

Romania will also carry out soil improvement work on 300,000 hectares of land this year. So far, 32% of this task has been completed, and the amount of earthwork excavated has doubled compared to the same period last year.

One of the main reasons for the great achievements in Romania's water conservancy construction and soil improvement work this year is the active participation of the broad masses in labor. This year, a total of 40 million cubic meters of earthwork needs to be excavated across the country, more than half of which will be completed by voluntary labor. At present, farmers participating in voluntary labor have already contributed more than 4 million workdays.

Romania's water conservancy construction and soil improvement work has great economic significance. It is estimated that as a result of vigorous land reclamation, flood prevention, and drainage, Romania will be able to increase its arable land by more than 500,000 hectares this year, which can increase grain production by approximately 1.25 million tons.

    罗马尼亚大兴水利改良土壤
    奋战三月猛增水浇地五万八千公顷
    今年内要使全国灌溉面积增加一倍
    新华社布加勒斯特讯　本社记者报道：罗马尼亚全国正展开着一个大兴水利和改良土壤的运动，仅在最近三个月内，就猛增了五万八千公顷的水浇地，相当于去年全国总灌溉面积的58％。
    今年入春以来，全国各地成千上万的农民、士兵和机关干部在工地上进行忘我的劳动，为战胜自然灾害和提高农业产量而斗争。现在，除了已增加的五万八千公顷的水浇地以外，预计可以灌溉二万五千公顷土地的水利工程也将在最近完工。到那时，罗马尼亚部长会议提出的今年增加七万八千公顷灌溉面积的任务将超额6.4％完成。
    但是，国营农场的工人和农民群众并不以此为满足。他们将在夏收以后继续展开兴修水利的新战斗，计划至少再扩大灌溉面积一万九千公顷，即在今年内要使全国的灌溉面积增加一倍。
    过去，罗马尼亚有一百二十万公顷的农田受到多瑙河洪水泛滥的灾害，而只有三、四千公顷的农田可以用这条河水灌溉。今年兴修的水利工程将使多瑙河能够灌溉二万公顷左右的农田，以后还计划修建更多的水利工程，使多瑙河为大量农田服务。
    罗马尼亚今年还要在三十万公顷的土地上进行土壤改良工作。到目前为止，这一任务已经完成了32％，所挖的土方比去年同一时期增加了一倍。
    今年罗马尼亚兴修水利和改良土壤工作获得巨大成就的主要原因之一是广大群众积极参加劳动。今年各地共需挖土四千万公方，其中半数以上将由义务劳动完成。现在，参加义务劳动的农民已经作了四百多万个劳动日。
    罗马尼亚兴修水利和改良土壤的工作具有巨大的经济意义。预计，由于大力开荒、防涝和排涝的结果，今年罗马尼亚能够增加五十万公顷以上的可耕地，可增产大约一百二十五万吨的粮食。
