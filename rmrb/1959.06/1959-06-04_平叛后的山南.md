Shannan region, north of the Himalayas and south of the Yarlung Zangbo River, has always been known as the "granary" of the Tibetan Plateau. On the wide plains along the Yarlung Zangbo River, the yield per unit area of grain is one or two times higher than in other parts of Tibet, with the highest yield per mu reaching ten to twenty *ke* (one *ke* is about 25 *jin*) of highland barley. The fertile grasslands at the foot of the Himalayas are also one of Tibet's famous pastoral areas, supplying large quantities of dried meat and butter to various places every year. However, the rich land did not bring happiness to the people of Shannan. The territories of the major serf owners in Tibet were mostly concentrated here. For many years, the people lived a miserable life under the cruel exploitation and oppression of the serf system. After the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet launched a rebellion, they also used the rich and dangerous conditions there as a nest, turning it into a hell on earth.

In early April, when I accompanied the People's Liberation Army's suppression troops to Shannan, once across the Yarlung Zangbo River, although it was the season of peach blossoms and green willows, the fields were barren, and no farming crowds could be seen on the plains. The rebels plundered the people's property, livestock, grain, butter, tea, salt, etc. Many families had to use bitter water boiled from bark and grass as tea, and the people were threatened by hunger, in deep suffering.

However, in just over a month, the face of Shannan changed. The People's Liberation Army quickly quelled the rebellion there and immediately set about helping the local people heal their wounds. Now, the wheat seedlings in the fields of Shannan are lush green, streams gurgle everywhere, and the sound of mules and horses rings out again on the roads. Many young and middle-aged people who were coerced into participating in the rebellion have been generously released by the People's Liberation Army and have returned home to participate in production. Normal religious life has also resumed in the monasteries. Tsetang, which had once become a dead city under the siege of the rebels, has been re-prospering. Shops have opened, vendors have set up stalls with various daily necessities, and the tea shop of the Shannan branch of the Tibet Trade Corporation is always crowded with people. In the past month or so, this shop has supplied 30,000 *tuo cha* (compressed tea bricks) to the Tibetan people in various parts of Shannan to meet their needs. On April 22, more than 3,000 people from all over Shannan celebrated the annual "Saga Dawa" festival in Changzhu according to traditional customs. People went to Changzhu Monastery to worship Buddha and chant scriptures, set up tents in the *lingka* (park) to dance and sing to their hearts' content, and exchanged items brought from various places.

The Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shannan have done tremendous work to help the people of Shannan with spring plowing and production. When the Tibetan people saw the green wheat seedlings in the fields, they often said:

"When the rebels were here, they not only had no intention of farming, but even if they wanted to, where would they get seeds and cattle! Without the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, we would only be waiting to starve to death." As soon as the suppression army crossed the border, the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission sent work teams to various places to lead the masses to establish rebellion suppression and production committees to carry out emergency plowing and planting, and announced that the land of rebel elements would be reaped by whoever cultivated it this year. The Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission also lent hundreds of thousands of *jin* of seeds to poor farmers and helped households lacking livestock to solve the difficulty of lacking cattle. The suppression troops dispatched a large number of personnel to help farmers deliver manure and repair irrigation canals, and drew military horses to help plow the land. They also helped those whose houses had been destroyed by the rebels to repair and build houses. The officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Tsetang helped poor farmers near the garrison who lacked labor to deliver more than 30,000 *jin* of manure in one day. Under the help and encouragement of the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of Tibetan farmers quickly ended the spring plowing.

Before the rebellion was quelled, as in other parts of Tibet, some people could be seen in Tsetang and various villages and towns who had to beg for a living due to the cruel exploitation and oppression of the serf owners. After the rebels occupied Shannan, even more people were forced to go out begging. After the rebellion was quelled, the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army troops provided relief to these people, and many were introduced to repair roads, do odd jobs, or participate in agricultural production. More than 20 orphans and widowed people in Tsetang City who lived by begging were given food and wool by the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission, and they were organized to spin wool yarn, so that they could live a stable life. Eleven serf households who had gone bankrupt and were wandering in the "Rong" (place name) area were placed in *xikas* (estates) with insufficient labor and participated in agricultural and pastoral production. The Jidexiu and Tsetang textile workers, known throughout Tibet for weaving *pulu* (Tibetan wool fabric), repaired their tools and started weaving again with the wool they had borrowed.

I recently participated in a celebration ceremony in Tsetang for a serf household moving into a new home. The owner, Boze, was a serf of Angjue Temple. When the rebels besieged Tsetang, the temple steward wanted to forcibly occupy his daughter, Yangjin. Boze did not want his pregnant daughter to be harmed, so he secretly asked his daughter and son-in-law to hide in a house near our agency. When the steward led a group of rebels to snatch her, he found nothing and became angry. He tore down the two earthen houses where Boze's family of six lived, transported the wood to repair fortifications, and robbed his family of the only highland barley, leaving Boze's family displaced. After the rebellion was quelled, Boze not only received 8 *ke* of food and seeds from the Military Control Commission, but also dozens of officers and soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army built a bright new house for him on the ruins. Just a few days before the whole family moved into the new home, his daughter gave birth to a baby. To celebrate the new life, the whole family decided to name the child "Nyima" (sun), symbolizing the light of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army shining on his family.

A poor serf, Tsering Wangdu, said after the Shannan rebellion was quelled: "In the past, I only knew that raising chickens to lay eggs was to give gifts to officials and estate owners. Now my family can use eggs to exchange for salt and tea!" This sentence contains how much blood and tears of the Tibetan people, and also shows how much change the Tibetan people are experiencing! Now, the people of Shannan regard the People's Liberation Army troops who liberated them and helped them turn over, as well as the work team members of the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission, as their own relatives. They affectionately call the People's Liberation Army "our army" and the work team cadres "our workers." At mass meetings held in many places, when the work team announced that the land of rebel elements would be reaped by whoever cultivated it this year and no land rent would be paid, many people shed tears of gratitude on the spot. Now, wherever the People's Liberation Army and the work team go, the children surround them, holding their hands and asking to be taught songs, while the adults tell the People's Liberation Army and the work team about their suffering under the serf system, and urgently demand the abolition of all *ula* (corvée labor), debt reduction, the elimination of personal dependence, and the early implementation of democratic reform.

Now, under the leadership and help of the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army troops, the people of Shannan are working hard to build their new life. People are automatically organizing to help the People's Liberation Army capture scattered bandits. The number of students enrolled in various places has never been so high. When Tsetang Elementary School was preparing to open, the number of students enrolled was more than double that before the rebellion. When the Sangri Work Team of the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission proposed to run a primary school, the local people immediately started to find houses and carpenters to make classroom equipment, and the number of people enrolled accounted for 80% of the school-age children in the area. This year's agricultural production has also seen an unprecedented scene. The area of cultivated land has expanded, and some fallow land has also been planted with crops. People have changed the habit of letting livestock graze freely, and they keep cattle and sheep under guard or grazed by people to avoid trampling on wheat seedlings. The masses are also building water conservancy projects under the leadership of the Rebellion Suppression and Production Committee. The "Rong" area, which has always lacked water conservancy, found two water sources with the help of the work team and built two canals and one spillway in a few days. Some elderly people said to the People's Liberation Army and the work team cadres when requesting democratic reforms: "While I am still alive, I want to live a free and happy life!" Their wishes will surely be realized!

    平叛后的山南
    新华社记者　景家栋
    喜马拉雅山以北、雅鲁藏布江以南的山南地区，一向被称为西藏高原上的“粮仓”。雅鲁藏布江沿岸宽阔的平原上，粮食单位面积产量要比西藏其他地区高一、两倍，亩产最高达到十克到二十克（一克二十五斤左右）青稞。喜马拉雅山下肥美的草原，又是西藏的有名牧区之一，每年以大量的干肉、酥油供应各地。可是富饶的土地并没有给山南人民带来幸福。西藏大农奴主的领地多集中在这里，多少年来，人民一直在农奴制度的残酷剥削和压迫下过着悲惨的生活。西藏上层反动分子发动叛乱后，也利用那里富饶和险峻等条件，把山南做为巢穴，使这里变成了人间地狱。
    4月初，记者随同人民解放军平叛部队来山南时，一过雅鲁藏布江，虽然是桃红柳绿的季节，可是田野荒芜，平原上看不到耕种的人群。叛匪掠夺了老百姓的财物和牲畜、粮食、酥油、茶叶、盐巴等。许多人家不得不用树皮草根熬出来的苦水当茶喝，人民受着饥饿的威胁，正处在深沉的苦难中。
    但是，只经过短短一个多月的时间，山南的面貌就变了样。人民解放军迅速平息了那里的叛乱，并且立即着手帮助当地人民医治创伤。现在，山南地区的田野里麦苗碧绿，到处流水淙淙，道路上又响起了骡马的铃铛声。许多被胁迫参加叛乱的青壮年得到了人民解放军的宽大释放，已经回家参加生产。寺院里也恢复了正常的宗教生活。在叛匪围困下一度变为死市的泽当已经重新繁荣起来，商店开了门，摊贩摆出了各种生活用品，西藏贸易总公司山南分公司的茶叶门市部里，总是拥挤着人群。一个多月来，这个门市部已经以三万块沱茶供应了山南各地藏族人民的需要。4月22日，来自山南各地的三千多人，按照传统习惯在昌珠欢度了一年一度的“萨噶达瓦”节，人们到昌珠寺拜佛诵经，在林卡里搭起帐篷尽情地跳舞唱歌，还把从各地带来的物品进行了交换。
    中共山南分工委和进驻山南的人民解放军，为帮助山南人民春耕生产进行了巨大的工作。藏胞们看到田里碧青的麦苗，常常这样说：
  “叛匪在这里的时候，不但没心肠种地，就是想种，又那来的种子和耕牛！没有共产党、解放军，我们只有等着饿死。”平叛大军刚一过境，中共山南分工委和山南军管会就派出工作组，到各地领导群众成立平叛生产委员会进行抢耕抢种，并且宣布对叛乱分子的土地今年实行谁种谁收的政策。中共山南分工委和山南军管会还给贫苦农民贷放了几十万斤种子，帮助缺少畜力的农户解决缺乏耕牛的困难。平叛部队出动大批人员帮助农民送粪、整修水渠，抽出军用马匹帮助耕地，还帮助被叛匪破坏了房屋的人修房盖屋。驻泽当部队的官兵帮助驻地附近缺劳力的贫苦农民，在一天中送粪三万多斤。广大藏族农民在中共山南分工委和人民解放军的帮助、鼓舞下，迅速结束了春耕。
    在叛乱平息前，和西藏其他地区一样，在泽当和各村镇都可以看到一些人由于农奴主的残酷剥削、压迫而不得不以讨乞为生。叛匪盘据山南以后，被迫出外乞讨的人更多了。叛乱平息后，中共山南分工委和人民解放军部队对这些人进行了救济，许多人被介绍去修路、做小工或参加农业生产。泽当市有二十多个孤寡无依以乞讨为生的人，中共山南分工委和山南军管会给他们贷放了口粮和羊毛，还把他们组织起来纺捻毛线，使他们过着安定的生活。因破产而流浪在“绒”（地名）地方的十一户农奴，被安插到劳动力不足的溪卡里，参加了农牧业生产。以织氆氇闻名全藏的吉德秀和泽当的纺织工人，重行修整了工具，用贷得的羊毛，又开始了纺织。
    记者最近在泽当参加了一户农奴搬入新居的庆祝仪式。主人波则是安觉寺的农奴，叛匪围困泽当时，寺院管家想强占他的女儿央津，波则不愿让已经怀孕的女儿任人残害，暗暗地叫女儿和女婿躲避到我机关附近的一间屋子里。当管家领着一群叛匪来抢人时，扑了个空，就恼羞成怒，扒掉了波则六口人居住的两间土屋，把木材运去修工事，抢走了他家仅有的一些青稞，使波则一家人流离失所。叛乱被平息后，波则不但得到了军管会救济的八克口粮和种子，人民解放军某部几十个官兵还为他在废墟上建起一座敞亮的新屋。就在全家搬入新居的前几天，他的女儿生了个娃娃。为了祝贺新生，全家商定给小孩取名叫“尼玛”（太阳），象征共产党、解放军的光芒照耀到了他的家庭。
    一个贫苦的农奴泽仁旺堆在山南叛乱平息后说：“过去我只知道养鸡生蛋是给官员和庄园主送礼，现在我家能用鸡蛋去换盐茶了！”这句话包含着西藏人民的多少血泪，也说明了西藏人民正在经历着多大的变化！现在，山南人民把解放他们和帮助他们翻身的解放军部队和中共山南分工委、山南军管会的工作组人员当做自己的亲人，他们亲热地把解放军称为“我们的军队”，把工作组的干部称为“我们的工作员”。在许多地方召开的群众会上，当工作组宣布对叛乱分子的土地今年实行谁种谁收、不交地租的政策时，有许多人当场感激得流下泪来。现在，解放军和工作组的人员每到一地，孩子们就围上来拉着手叫教唱歌，大人们则向解放军和工作组倾诉他们在农奴制度下的痛苦，迫切要求废除所有的乌拉差役，减免债务，取消人身依附和早日实行民主改革。
    现在，山南人民正在中共山南分工委和解放军部队的领导、帮助下，努力建设自己新的生活。人们自动组织起来，帮助解放军捕捉散匪。目前各地入学的学生从来没有这样多过，泽当小学筹备开学时，报名的学生比叛乱前增多了两倍以上；中共山南分工委和山南军管会桑日工作组倡议办小学时，当地群众马上动手找房子，找来木匠制造课堂用具，报名入学的人数占当地学龄儿童的80％。今年的农业生产也出现了前所未有的景象。耕地的面积扩大了，有些休耕地也种上了庄稼。人们改变了放野牲口的习惯，把牛羊看管起来或是由人放牧，以免糟踏麦苗。群众还在平叛生产委员会的领导下大修水利。一向缺少水利的“绒”地方，在工作组的帮助下找到了两处水源，几天内就修了两条水渠和一处溢水口。有些老人在向人民解放军和工作组干部要求实行民主改革的时候说：“趁我活着的时候，我要过一过自由幸福的日子！”他们的愿望是一定会实现的！（附图片）
