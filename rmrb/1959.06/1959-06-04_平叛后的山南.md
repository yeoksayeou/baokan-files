Shannan region, north of the Himalayas and south of the Yarlung Zangbo River, has always been known as the "granary" of the Tibetan Plateau. On the wide plains along the Yarlung Zangbo River, the yield per unit area of grain is one or two times higher than in other parts of Tibet, with the highest yield per mu reaching ten to twenty *ke* (one *ke* is about 25 *jin*) of highland barley. The fertile grasslands at the foot of the Himalayas are also one of Tibet's famous pastoral areas, supplying large quantities of dried meat and butter to various places every year. However, the rich land did not bring happiness to the people of Shannan. The territories of the major serf owners in Tibet were mostly concentrated here. For many years, the people lived a miserable life under the cruel exploitation and oppression of the serf system. After the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet launched a rebellion, they also used the rich and dangerous conditions there as a nest, turning it into a hell on earth.

In early April, when I accompanied the People's Liberation Army's suppression troops to Shannan, once across the Yarlung Zangbo River, although it was the season of peach blossoms and green willows, the fields were barren, and no farming crowds could be seen on the plains. The rebels plundered the people's property, livestock, grain, butter, tea, salt, etc. Many families had to use bitter water boiled from bark and grass as tea, and the people were threatened by hunger, in deep suffering.

However, in just over a month, the face of Shannan changed. The People's Liberation Army quickly quelled the rebellion there and immediately set about helping the local people heal their wounds. Now, the wheat seedlings in the fields of Shannan are lush green, streams gurgle everywhere, and the sound of mules and horses rings out again on the roads. Many young and middle-aged people who were coerced into participating in the rebellion have been generously released by the People's Liberation Army and have returned home to participate in production. Normal religious life has also resumed in the monasteries. Tsetang, which had once become a dead city under the siege of the rebels, has been re-prospering. Shops have opened, vendors have set up stalls with various daily necessities, and the tea shop of the Shannan branch of the Tibet Trade Corporation is always crowded with people. In the past month or so, this shop has supplied 30,000 *tuo cha* (compressed tea bricks) to the Tibetan people in various parts of Shannan to meet their needs. On April 22, more than 3,000 people from all over Shannan celebrated the annual "Saga Dawa" festival in Changzhu according to traditional customs. People went to Changzhu Monastery to worship Buddha and chant scriptures, set up tents in the *lingka* (park) to dance and sing to their hearts' content, and exchanged items brought from various places.

The Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shannan have done tremendous work to help the people of Shannan with spring plowing and production. When the Tibetan people saw the green wheat seedlings in the fields, they often said:

"When the rebels were here, they not only had no intention of farming, but even if they wanted to, where would they get seeds and cattle! Without the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, we would only be waiting to starve to death." As soon as the suppression army crossed the border, the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission sent work teams to various places to lead the masses to establish rebellion suppression and production committees to carry out emergency plowing and planting, and announced that the land of rebel elements would be reaped by whoever cultivated it this year. The Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission also lent hundreds of thousands of *jin* of seeds to poor farmers and helped households lacking livestock to solve the difficulty of lacking cattle. The suppression troops dispatched a large number of personnel to help farmers deliver manure and repair irrigation canals, and drew military horses to help plow the land. They also helped those whose houses had been destroyed by the rebels to repair and build houses. The officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Tsetang helped poor farmers near the garrison who lacked labor to deliver more than 30,000 *jin* of manure in one day. Under the help and encouragement of the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of Tibetan farmers quickly ended the spring plowing.

Before the rebellion was quelled, as in other parts of Tibet, some people could be seen in Tsetang and various villages and towns who had to beg for a living due to the cruel exploitation and oppression of the serf owners. After the rebels occupied Shannan, even more people were forced to go out begging. After the rebellion was quelled, the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army troops provided relief to these people, and many were introduced to repair roads, do odd jobs, or participate in agricultural production. More than 20 orphans and widowed people in Tsetang City who lived by begging were given food and wool by the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission, and they were organized to spin wool yarn, so that they could live a stable life. Eleven serf households who had gone bankrupt and were wandering in the "Rong" (place name) area were placed in *xikas* (estates) with insufficient labor and participated in agricultural and pastoral production. The Jidexiu and Tsetang textile workers, known throughout Tibet for weaving *pulu* (Tibetan wool fabric), repaired their tools and started weaving again with the wool they had borrowed.

I recently participated in a celebration ceremony in Tsetang for a serf household moving into a new home. The owner, Boze, was a serf of Angjue Temple. When the rebels besieged Tsetang, the temple steward wanted to forcibly occupy his daughter, Yangjin. Boze did not want his pregnant daughter to be harmed, so he secretly asked his daughter and son-in-law to hide in a house near our agency. When the steward led a group of rebels to snatch her, he found nothing and became angry. He tore down the two earthen houses where Boze's family of six lived, transported the wood to repair fortifications, and robbed his family of the only highland barley, leaving Boze's family displaced. After the rebellion was quelled, Boze not only received 8 *ke* of food and seeds from the Military Control Commission, but also dozens of officers and soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army built a bright new house for him on the ruins. Just a few days before the whole family moved into the new home, his daughter gave birth to a baby. To celebrate the new life, the whole family decided to name the child "Nyima" (sun), symbolizing the light of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army shining on his family.

A poor serf, Tsering Wangdu, said after the Shannan rebellion was quelled: "In the past, I only knew that raising chickens to lay eggs was to give gifts to officials and estate owners. Now my family can use eggs to exchange for salt and tea!" This sentence contains how much blood and tears of the Tibetan people, and also shows how much change the Tibetan people are experiencing! Now, the people of Shannan regard the People's Liberation Army troops who liberated them and helped them turn over, as well as the work team members of the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission, as their own relatives. They affectionately call the People's Liberation Army "our army" and the work team cadres "our workers." At mass meetings held in many places, when the work team announced that the land of rebel elements would be reaped by whoever cultivated it this year and no land rent would be paid, many people shed tears of gratitude on the spot. Now, wherever the People's Liberation Army and the work team go, the children surround them, holding their hands and asking to be taught songs, while the adults tell the People's Liberation Army and the work team about their suffering under the serf system, and urgently demand the abolition of all *ula* (corv√©e labor), debt reduction, the elimination of personal dependence, and the early implementation of democratic reform.

Now, under the leadership and help of the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army troops, the people of Shannan are working hard to build their new life. People are automatically organizing to help the People's Liberation Army capture scattered bandits. The number of students enrolled in various places has never been so high. When Tsetang Elementary School was preparing to open, the number of students enrolled was more than double that before the rebellion. When the Sangri Work Team of the Shannan Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shannan Military Control Commission proposed to run a primary school, the local people immediately started to find houses and carpenters to make classroom equipment, and the number of people enrolled accounted for 80% of the school-age children in the area. This year's agricultural production has also seen an unprecedented scene. The area of cultivated land has expanded, and some fallow land has also been planted with crops. People have changed the habit of letting livestock graze freely, and they keep cattle and sheep under guard or grazed by people to avoid trampling on wheat seedlings. The masses are also building water conservancy projects under the leadership of the Rebellion Suppression and Production Committee. The "Rong" area, which has always lacked water conservancy, found two water sources with the help of the work team and built two canals and one spillway in a few days. Some elderly people said to the People's Liberation Army and the work team cadres when requesting democratic reforms: "While I am still alive, I want to live a free and happy life!" Their wishes will surely be realized!
