Museums and Children

	Lou Shi

On the way back from visiting the Lu Xun Museum, I heard a story: A female teacher led a group of Young Pioneers to visit the Lu Xun Museum. Each child brought their own textbook. The female teacher asked the children to compare their books with the books Lu Xun read in his childhood at "Sanwei Study" and "Hundred Herb Garden." The children looked at the clean, thread-bound books on display and then looked down at their own textbooks, with curled pages and covered in stains, and they were all ashamed. From then on, these children cherished their books very much. This is truly a teacher who knows how to educate children and understands their psychology. Museums can stimulate children's interest in knowledge through educational exhibits, photos, etc. Organizing children to visit museums and memorial halls is a very good activity to carry out revolutionary tradition education for them. Museums are beckoning to the children, hoping that the children will become frequent little visitors there, learn about the history of the motherland from this classroom, and recognize the wisdom and strength of the working people, so that everyone will become strong warriors like their revolutionary fathers and brothers.

    博物馆和孩子
    陋室
    参观鲁迅博物馆回来的路上，听到一个故事：有位女教师领着一群红领巾参观鲁迅博物馆。每个孩子都带着自己用的课本。女教师让孩子们将书和鲁迅先生幼年在“三味书屋”“百草园”读过的书比一比。孩子们看了看展览着的那些洁净的线装书，又低头看了看手中的书页卷着、满沾污垢的课本，都羞得脸红了。从这以后，这些孩子都非常爱护书了。这真是一位教育孩子得法、熟悉孩子心理的教师。博物馆通过富有教育意义的实物、照片等进行宣传教育很能引起少年儿童们求知的兴趣。组织孩子参观博物馆、纪念馆，这是向他们进行革命传统教育的一种很好的活动。博物馆在向孩子们招手，希望孩子成为那里经常的小观众，从这座课堂里认识祖国的历史并且认识劳动人民的智慧和力量，像他们的革命父兄那样，人人成为坚强的战士。
