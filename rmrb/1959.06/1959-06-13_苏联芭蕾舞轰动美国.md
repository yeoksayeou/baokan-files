The Soviet Ballet Causes a Sensation in the United States

Queueing for 39 hours to buy "standing room" tickets

Before the Bolshoi Ballet Company of the Soviet Union even performed in the United States, the office of American performance agent Sol Hurok had already received three million ticket reservations. This number was eleven times greater than the total number of people that all the theaters could accommodate during the Soviet dance troupe's entire tour in the United States. The craze for buying tickets was unprecedented. American newspapers compared the American theaters staging the Soviet ballet to "besieged fortresses," because, as a ballet critic lamented in "The New York Times," "Brothers fought for tickets, and finally attacked Hurok together!"

At the theater entrance, it was truly "like facing a formidable enemy." Police had placed wooden barriers here to prevent the theater from being crushed. The ticket-buying queue stretched out in a long line, where people had to wait thirty-nine hours to buy a "standing room" ticket. Some people brought chairs, some brought bedding, and some even brought small tents to put up to shelter from the rain; in order not to waste time, students in the queue reviewed their lessons there, preparing for their big exams, and women knitted and sewed. "The New York Times" once published a statement from someone queuing to buy tickets, who said, "When I saw the long queue, I still decided to queue, because I thought it would be faster than going to the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow."

The famous American drama critic John Martin said that in the history of theatrical performances in the United States, there had been instances where tickets were sold out before the performance of a foreign ballet company, "but the previous situations were merely child's play compared to this time!"

Thousands of words express friendship

When the Soviet Ballet Company performed in New York, it received thousands of letters filled with friendship for the Soviet people. An American housewife named Mary Gruber wrote in a letter to Bolshoi Theater stars Struchkova and Lapauli: "If you could find time to have a cup of coffee with us, it would be such happiness for our whole family! But I know you are very busy and must receive millions of invitations. Thank you for coming to our country and bringing us great pleasure. This kind of meeting will prompt people to think about the future. As I write this letter, my husband says: If Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. Khrushchev could meet, even just for a cup of coffee, not only we, but the whole world would be happy. My husband says that this meeting must be held."

Another American named Bob Kushnir wrote in a letter to Soviet ballet dancer Sitnikov: "The State Department refused to invite the Soviet Army Song and Dance Ensemble to perform in the United States, using the excuse that the appearance of people in Soviet military uniforms on American stages would shock Americans. The gentlemen of the State Department are absolutely right. When the ballet film 'Stalingrad' was performed on the stage of the Subway Opera House, the appearance of Soviet soldiers won stormy applause... No, we have not forgotten your Stalingrad and the losses you suffered in the anti-fascist war, although some people want us to forget all this... Thank you for your art, thank you for your friendship."

American Critics' Praises

When the Soviet Ballet Company performed in New York, the famous American drama critic John Martin wrote that the Soviet Ballet Company's visit to the United States was the only news that had shaken Americans "since the American Civil War." He said: "American ballet directors must take off their hats to the Bolshoi Ballet's main director, Lavrovsky, because there is much to be learned from him."

American critic Wendell Daley pointed out that the United States does not have a national ballet school like the Bolshoi Theater. The United States does not consider training actors at all, but the Soviet Union is different. Daley wrote: "Most of the Soviet actors grow up together, study together, and perform together. They don't have to worry about finding other ways to make a living, and they don't have to worry about being laid off during the off-season. So it is not surprising that their performances are so coordinated and so wonderful."

The opinions of American critics boil down to one point, which is that the Soviet ballet has shown Americans true art. "New York Post" observer Francis Herridge exclaimed: "What a wonderful night! No good words can describe it all... We have never seen anything more wonderful than 'Swan Lake'..."

John Martin praised Soviet ballet master Ulanova as a "rare" actor in the world. He said: "Ulanova's genius surpasses any American actress."

### 苏联芭蕾舞轰动美国

    苏联芭蕾舞轰动美国
    排队39小时买“站票”
    当苏联大剧院芭蕾舞蹈团在美国演出之前，美国演出经纪人休洛克的办公室里早已收到三百万张票的预定单。这个数目比苏联舞蹈团在美国整个巡回演出期间各剧院所能容纳的人数还多十一倍。购买戏票的盛况空前。美国报纸把上演苏联芭蕾舞的美国剧院比喻为“被包围的堡垒”，因为正如芭蕾舞评论家在“纽约时报”上所感叹的：“亲兄弟为争票而搏斗，最后一起向休洛克进攻！”
    在剧院门口，真称得起是“如临大敌”。警察们在这里放满了木头的障碍物，以免把剧院挤塌了。买票的队伍摆开了一字长蛇阵，人们在这里要排三十九小时才能买到一张“站票”。买票的人，有的带着椅子，有的带着铺盖，甚至有人还带上了小帐篷，准备下雨时搭起来避雨；为了不浪费时间，排队的学生们就在那里复习功课，准备大考，妇女们也在织毛活，缝东西。“纽约时报”曾刊登了一位站队买票的人讲的话，这个人说：“当我看到了很长的队伍，我还是决定要排队，因为我想，这总比到莫斯科大剧院去看要快得多。”
    美国著名的戏剧评论家约翰·马丁说道，在美国的戏剧演出史中，也曾有过当外国的芭蕾舞蹈团上演之前票已售完的情况，“但是以往的情况同这次相比，只不过像是儿戏而已！”
    千言万语表友情
    苏联芭蕾舞蹈团在纽约演出的时候，就收到了成千上万封的信，这些信里充满了对苏联人民的友情。一位叫玛丽·戈鲁贝尔的美国家庭妇女在给苏联大剧院名演员斯特卢奇科娃和拉帕乌里的信中说道：“如果你们能抽出时间同我们喝杯咖啡，这对我们全家来说该是多么幸福呀！可是我知道你们非常忙，一定收到千百万个邀请。感谢你们到我国来，给我们带来了莫大的愉快。这种会见，会促使人们想到未来。我在写这封信的时候，我的丈夫说：如果艾森豪威尔先生同赫鲁晓夫先生会会面，那怕一起只喝点咖啡，那不仅我们，全世界都会高兴的。我的丈夫说，这种会见一定要举行。”
    另一位名叫鲍布·库什尼尔的美国人给苏联芭蕾舞演员西特尼科夫的信中写道：“国务院拒绝邀请苏联军队歌舞团到美国来演出，借口说美国的舞台上出现穿着苏联军装的人会使美国人受震动。国务院的先生们说得一点也不错。当地下铁道歌剧院的舞台上演出舞剧影片‘斯大林格勒’的时候，苏联士兵一出现，就博得了暴风雨般的掌声……不，我们没有忘记你们的斯大林格勒和你们在反法西斯战争中所遭受的损失，虽然有人想让我们忘记这一切……感谢你们的艺术，感谢你们的友情。”
  美国评论家们的赞叹
    美国著名的戏剧评论家约翰·马丁当苏联芭蕾舞蹈团在纽约演出时曾经写道：苏联芭蕾舞蹈团到美国访问，是“自从南北美战争以来”唯一使美国人震动的消息。他说：“美国的芭蕾舞导演者，在大剧院的芭蕾舞主要导演人拉夫罗夫斯基的面前一定要脱帽致敬，因为从他那里可以学到很多东西。”
    美国评论家汪戴尔·戴里指出，美国没有像苏联大剧院所办的那样的国立芭蕾舞学校。美国根本不考虑培养演员，而苏联却不同。戴里写道：“大多数的苏联演员都是在一起长大，一起学习，一起演出。他们用不着为想其他办法求得生计而伤脑筋，他们也用不着为在淡季时被解雇而担心。所以他们的表演这样协调一致，这样精彩绝伦，这是不足为奇的。”
    美国评论家们的意见归结为一点，就是苏联的芭蕾舞向美国人表明了真正的艺术。“纽约邮报”的观察家弗兰西斯·赫里治赞叹道：“这是一个多么美妙的夜晚啊！没有任何好的字眼能够形容这一切……我们从来没有见过比‘天鹅湖’更美妙的了……”
    约翰·马丁称赞苏联芭蕾舞大师乌兰诺娃为“世间少有”的演员。他说：“乌兰诺娃的天才超越了美国任何的女演员。”

    这是纽约布罗得维亚大街和第三十九号大街的一角，人们为了购买苏联大剧院芭蕾舞蹈团演出的票，在卖票的前一天就来排队了。
