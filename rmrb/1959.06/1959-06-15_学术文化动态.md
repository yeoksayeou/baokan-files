Socialist Countries Hold Economists' Conference

A conference of representatives from the economic research institutes of the Academies of Sciences of socialist countries was held in Prague recently. Forty-two economists from eleven socialist countries attended the meeting.

The conference was chaired by Keigor, Director of the Economic Research Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. Three groups were formed, namely the Socialist Political Economy Group, the World Socialist Economic System Issues Group, and the Capitalist Political Economy Group, to discuss suggestions for joint research on scientific issues. In addition, expert group meetings were held on issues related to industrial and agricultural economics, economic statistics, and the allocation of productive forces.

The conference decided to carry out the following work: 1. To publish jointly compiled works in 1959-1960: "Socialist Industrialization and Its Characteristics in Different Countries of the Socialist World System," "Agricultural Production Cooperativization and Its Characteristics in Various Countries of the Socialist World System," "Issues in National Economic Planning in Socialist Countries," and "Transformation and Rational Management of the National Economy in Countries of the Socialist Camp." To systematically translate and publish economic works from socialist countries. To publish a special bulletin to regularly report on the work of various economic research institutes in socialist countries and news of various forms of creative scientific cooperation.

2. To strengthen scientific ties and study the following issues in socialist political economy: reproduction and the balance of the national economy, the law of value in socialist countries and its utilization in economic practice, improving labor productivity in the national economies of socialist countries, investment effectiveness, and the adoption of new technologies, etc.

3. To jointly study individual issues of the world socialist system. For example, the Economic Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Economic Research Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences will jointly study the issue of "The Theoretical Basis and Prospects of International Division of Labor among Countries in the World Socialist System." They will also collaborate on studying the following issues of modern capitalism: "Capitalist Reproduction, Economic Crises, and State Monopoly Capitalism," "The Condition of the Working Class under the Modern Capitalist System," and "The Collapse of the Colonial System and the Economic Development of Underdeveloped Countries," etc.

A Look at Aesthetic Research in Czechoslovakia

Czechoslovakian aesthetician and professor at Charles University in Prague, Novak, published an article in the French journal "Revue d'Esthétique" entitled "Modern Czechoslovakian Aesthetics," introducing the aesthetic research work in Czechoslovakia.

Novak said that modern Czechoslovakian aesthetics has two characteristics: one is its close integration with national art, and the other is its connection with German and French philosophy. Before World War I, Czechoslovakian aesthetics was permeated by two opposing German aesthetics, namely formalism and Schopenhauer's romanticism. However, Czechoslovakian aesthetics of this period was not only influenced by German philosophy but also by French thought, especially Comte's positivism and Taine's art theory. After World War I, Czechoslovakian aestheticians, under the influence of Western Europe, began to study works of art as objective objects, and thus aesthetics became art studies. Major works of this period include Novak's "Fundamentals of Art Studies," written from an epistemological viewpoint, and the works of Neyedlý and others. In the 1930s, Mukařovský and the Prague linguists proposed a new direction, namely structuralism. Completely different from previous tendencies, this aesthetic completely ignored the external conditions of art production, as well as historical, social, and psychological elements, focusing only on the work itself, its internal structure, and its relationship with previous forms of work.

Speaking of the current state of Czechoslovakian aesthetics, Novak pointed out that current Czechoslovakian aesthetics has completely overcome the structuralism that was prevalent before World War II and has established aesthetics on a materialist basis. This direction had already begun to sprout in the 1920s. For example, Fučík and Vakulaвик in literary history and literary criticism; Neyedlý and Norman in the study of aesthetics and art studies, have all taken this position.

When talking about some fundamental issues that should be resolved in the field of art studies, Novak said that the questions currently being explored by Czechoslovakian aesthetics are: first, the issue of art and beauty as a special reflection of reality; second, the issue of the creation of works of art, which is the central issue of aesthetic research – the issue of the content and form of the work. The next step is to resolve the issue of reflecting individual and class consciousness through works of art, and the issue of the reaction of art to the socio-economic base and historical development.

United States Publishes a Ten-Year Plan for Ocean Research

According to a report in the American "Christian Science Monitor," a special research committee of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences has published a report proposing a ten-year (1960-1970) plan to strengthen ocean science research. According to the committee, exploring the deep sea is as important as exploring space; from a military point of view, ways can be found to defend against submarines launching missiles, and from a peacetime point of view, obtaining food, minerals, and other substances from the deep sea is more profitable than exploring space. The ten-year plan also calls on the U.S. government to increase support for practical marine science, especially in the military, development and utilization of food and minerals, and related radioactive science. The report said that the latter research would help clarify the possibility and safety of dumping atomic waste into the deep sea.

West German Publishing Industry Promotes Neo-Fascism

West Germany has been constantly publishing books promoting neo-fascism and revanchism in recent years. A book guide published in Solingen recently listed six hundred and fifty books of a revanchist nature. These books were all published in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. Many large publishers in West Germany, such as "Laudenburg Publishing House" and "Homeland Publishing House," regard the promotion of militarism and revanchism as their "noble" mission, and they publish a large number of memoirs of Hitler's servants. In addition, one hundred and ninety periodical publishers are also actively engaged in propaganda promoting war and hatred of humanity. West German publishing houses have become "quiet havens" for writers who served the "Third Reich," and many fascist writers have participated in the activities of these publishing houses. Albert Smagun, the former counselor of Hitler's embassy in Czechoslovakia, serves as the manager of "Homeland Publishing House" and the editor of the revanchist journal "East-West Express." Recently, he also organized a publisher association. The members of this association are all former Hitler followers.

    社会主义国家举行经济学家会议
    社会主义国家科学院经济研究所代表会议，不久前在布拉格举行，出席会议的有十一个社会主义国家的四十二位经济学家。
    会议由捷克斯洛伐克科学院经济研究所所长凯戈尔主持。成立了三个组，即社会主义政治经济学组、世界社会主义经济体系问题组、资本主义政治经济学组，讨论了共同研究的科学问题的建议。此外，还举行了有关工农业经济问题、经济统计学问题、生产力的配置问题的专家分组会议。
    会议决定将进行下列工作：一、在1959—1960年出版共同编写的下列著作：“社会主义工业化及其在社会主义世界体系不同国家的特点”，“农业生产合作化及其在社会主义世界体系各个国家的特点”，“社会主义国家的国民经济计划工作问题”，“社会主义阵营各国国民经济的改造和合理管理问题”。有系统地互相翻译出版社会主义国家的经济学著作。出版一种专门的公报，经常报道有关社会主义国家各经济研究所工作情况，和各种创造性的科学合作形式的消息。
    二、加强科学联系，研究社会主义政治经济学的下列问题：再生产与国民经济的平衡，社会主义国家的价值规律及其在经济实践中的利用，社会主义国家国民经济中劳动生产率的提高、投资效果与采用新技术等。
    三、共同研究世界社会主义体系的个别问题。例如，苏联科学院经济研究所和捷克斯洛伐克科学院经济研究所共同研究“世界社会主义体系国家间国际分工的理论基础和前景”问题。还将协作研究现代资本主义的下列一些问题：“资本主义的再生产、经济危机和国家垄断资本主义”，“现代资本主义制度下工人阶级的状况”，“殖民体系的瓦解和不发达国家的经济发展”等。
    捷克斯洛伐克的美学研究情况
    捷克斯洛伐克美学家、布拉格查理大学教授诺瓦克，在法国的“美学评论”杂志上发表了一篇题为“现代捷克斯洛伐克美学”文章，介绍捷克斯洛伐克的美学研究工作。
    诺瓦克说，现代的捷克斯洛伐克美学有两个特点：一是同民族艺术的紧密结合，一是同德国、法国哲学的联系。在第一次世界大战前，捷克斯洛伐克美学是渗透了德国的两种相反的美学，这就是形式主义和叔本华的浪漫主义思想。但是这一时期的捷克斯洛伐克美学，也不仅受德国哲学的影响，还受法国思想，尤其是孔德的实证主义、泰纳的艺术理论的影响。第一次世界大战后，捷克斯洛伐克的美学家在西欧的影响之下，开始把艺术作品当作客观对象来研究，因而美学变成了艺术学。这时主要著作有诺瓦克从认识论的观点写成的“艺术学的基础”和乃叶德里等人的著作。到1930年代，牟卡洛夫斯基和布拉格的语言学家提出一个新的方向，这就是结构主义。同以前的倾向完全不同，这种美学完全不研究艺术产生的外部条件，也不研究历史的、社会的、心理的要素，而只注意作品本身、作品的内部结构、同以前作品形式的关系等。
    在谈到捷克斯洛伐克美学现状时，诺瓦克指出，现在的捷克斯洛伐克美学，已经完全克服了第二次世界大战前盛极一时的结构主义，而把美学建立在唯物主义的基础上了。这一方向在1920年代就已经开始萌芽。例如，伏契克、瓦库拉维克在文学史、文学批评方面；乃叶德里、诺曼等在美学、艺术学的研究方面，都已站在这一立场。
    诺瓦克在谈到艺术学方面应该解决的一些根本问题时说，现在捷克斯洛伐克美学所探讨的问题是：第一是作为现实的特殊反映的艺术和美的问题；第二是艺术作品的创作问题，即美学研究的中心问题——作品的内容和形式的问题。再下一步就是解决通过艺术作品反映个人的、阶级的意识问题，艺术对社会经济基础、历史发展的反作用问题。
    美国发表研究海洋的十年计划
    据美国“基督教科学箴言报”报道，美国全国科学院的一个专题研究委员会发表了一份报告，提出了一项加强海洋科学研究的十年（1960—1970）计划。据这个委员会说，探索深海和探索空间同样重要；从军事利益看，可以找到防御发射导弹的潜水艇的办法，从平时利益来看，向深海取得食物、矿物质和其他物质，比探索空间更有利可图。这个十年计划还要求美国政府增加对实用海洋科学的支持，尤其是在军事、开发和利用食物、矿物质方面和有关放射性科学方面。报告说后一方面的研究有助于弄清将原子废料倾入深海的可能性和安全的问题。
    西德出版界鼓吹新法西斯主义
    西德近年来不断出版鼓吹新法西斯主义和复仇主义的书籍。在佐林根城不久前出版了一本图书指南，其中列举了六百五十种复仇主义性质的书。这些书都是德意志联邦共和国在1957年中间出版的。西德的许多大的出版社，如“劳登堡出版社”、“祖国出版社”等，都把宣传军国主义和复仇主义作为自己的“高尚”使命，它们大量出版希特勒的仆从们的回忆录。此外，还有一百九十家定期刊物出版社也积极进行鼓吹战争和仇恨人类的宣传。西德的出版机构变成了为“第三帝国”服务的文人们的“安静的港湾”，许多法西斯作家参加了这些出版机构的活动。希特勒的前驻捷克斯洛伐克大使馆顾问阿尔伯特·史马贡担任了“祖国出版社”的经理和鼓吹复仇主义的刊物“东西快讯”的编辑。近来他还组织了一个出版者协会。这个协会的成员都是从前的希特勒分子。
