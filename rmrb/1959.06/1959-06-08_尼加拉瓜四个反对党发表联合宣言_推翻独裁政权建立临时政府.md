Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 7th. TASS reports: Nicaragua's four opposition parties have jointly issued a declaration calling for the overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship and the establishment of a provisional people's government composed of people from all sectors participating in the struggle to overthrow the dictatorship.

The document, entitled "Declaration of Principles and Minimum Program of the Nicaraguan Revolution of 1959," was published in a recent issue of the Uruguayan newspaper "El Popular." The Nicaraguan opposition parties that signed the document include: the Independent Liberal Party, the Christian Social Party, the Socialist Party, and the Republican Mobilization Party.

The declaration states, "We believe that our struggle is a stage in the historical process, and historical development is leading to the demise of Nicaragua's vile oppressive system, to be replaced by another system that will guarantee our motherland's political, economic, social, and spiritual liberation."

The declaration then discusses the dark rule imposed by the dictator in Nicaragua. It states that the dynastic rule that seized power has been rampant in Nicaragua for twenty-five years. General elections are frequently cancelled, opposition parties are constantly persecuted, the trade union movement is being suppressed, and mass shootings and torture occur frequently. Natural wealth is leased to foreign capitalists under conditions of servitude. Unemployment and poverty, caused by the existence of a semi-feudal economy arbitrarily controlled by domestic and foreign exploiters, are increasing nationwide, and labor laws are frequently violated.

The declaration elucidates the following basic demands to be achieved by the Nicaraguan revolution: completely eradicate the dynastic system and the social and state institutions that serve it; punish criminals guilty of evil deeds, torture, and persecution; confiscate illegally obtained property and resources; organize a democratic army; establish a provisional people's government composed of people from all sectors participating in the struggle to overthrow the current regime; abolish all treaties and obligations that undermine national sovereignty; implement land reform; and raise national culture through adult education. In terms of foreign policy, the declaration determines to establish friendship and alliance among the peoples of Latin American countries and to cooperate with all forces striving for international peace and friendship.

    尼加拉瓜四个反对党发表联合宣言
    推翻独裁政权建立临时政府
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚消息：尼加拉瓜四个反对党联合发表宣言，号召推翻索摩查独裁者，建立由参加推翻独裁斗争的所有阶层人民组成的临时人民政府。
    这个名为“尼加拉瓜1959年革命的原则宣言和最低纲领”的文件发表在最近的乌拉圭“人民报”上。参加签署这份文件的有以下几个尼加拉瓜反对党：独立自由党、天主教社会党、社会主义党和共和动员党。
    宣言中说，“我们认为，我们的斗争是历史进程的一个阶段，历史的发展正在导致尼加拉瓜丑恶的压迫制度的灭亡，而代之以另外一种将能保证我们的祖国获得政治、经济、社会和精神上的解放的制度。”
    宣言接着谈到独裁者在尼加拉瓜实行的黑暗统治。它说，篡夺了政权的王朝统治在尼加拉瓜横行霸道已经二十五年。普选经常被取消，反对派政党不断遭受迫害，工会运动正在遭受镇压，不断发生大规模的枪杀和拷打。天然财富在奴役性条件下租让给外国资本家。由于本国和外国大剥削者任意宰割的半封建经济的存在而引起的失业和贫困正在全国日益增长，劳工法经常受到破坏。
    这项宣言阐明了尼加拉瓜革命所要实现的下列基本要求，彻底铲除王朝制度和为它服务的社会及国家机构；惩办有罪恶、有拷打和迫害行为的罪犯；没收非法得来的财产和富源；组织民主军队；建立由参加推翻现政权斗争的所有阶层人民组成的临时人民政府；废除一切损害民族主权的条约和义务；实行土地改革；通过成人教育的方法提高民族文化。在外交政策方面，宣言确定要在拉丁美洲各国人民之间建立友谊和联盟，同争取国际和平和友好的一切力量进行合作。
