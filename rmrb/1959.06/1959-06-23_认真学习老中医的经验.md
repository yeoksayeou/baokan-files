    Our country's medicine has a long history and a rich heritage. In addition to what is recorded in the medical literature of past dynasties, much is scattered among the veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors who have passed it down through generations.

    In the past, most veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors learned from masters from a young age, studied the strengths of various schools, and accumulated decades of rich clinical experience. Some of their techniques have not yet been recorded in writing. It is a very important task to synthesize and organize these experiences so that they are not lost. However, most of the doctors with this experience are older and cannot undertake this arduous task. These experiences can only be passed on through oral instruction and personal transmission, and can only be accepted by learners who carefully understand them. Therefore, it is very important to organize young Chinese and Western medicine doctors to learn their academic experience in a timely manner and accept their valuable experience.

    In order to do a good job in learning and inheriting the academic experience of veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for both young Chinese and Western medicine doctors and veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors. We must eliminate the concerns of veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors about not teaching well, and about not having a good teacher-student relationship, and encourage them to teach their skills enthusiastically and conscientiously. In particular, we must educate young Chinese and Western medicine doctors not to be arrogant and complacent, but to learn from veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors with humility and sincerity. Even if there is only one strength in the academic experience of veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors, we should try to accept it. In short, we must respect teachers and love students, and both sides must be close and intimate, in order to teach well, learn well, and achieve significant results.

    There are many ways to learn the academic experience of veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors, such as taking on a master, holding seminars, having individual conversations, and recording oral instructions. Among these, taking on a master and bringing along an apprentice should be the main method. This makes it easier to systematically and comprehensively accept their academic experience.

    认真学习老中医的经验
    我们祖国的医学，历史悠久，遗产丰富，除了一部分记载在历代医学文献中的以外，还有很多分散在世代相传的老年中医手里。
    老年中医过去多是从小拜师，学习了各家所长，并积累了数十年丰富的临床经验，其中有一些技术迄今未用文字记载下来。把这些经验加以综合整理，不使失传，是一项十分重要的任务。可是具有这些经验的医生，多数年龄较高，不能担负这项繁重的任务。这些经验，只有靠他们口授心传，学习者细心加以体会才能接受。因此及时组织青年中、西医学习他们的学术经验，把他们的宝贵经验接受下来，这是十分重要的工作。
    为了做好学习和继承老年中医学术经验的工作，就要加强对青年中、西医和老年中医双方的思想教育。要消除老年中医怕教不好、怕师徒关系搞不好等顾虑，鼓励他们热情、认真地传授技术；特别要教育青年中、西医不要骄傲自满，要虚心诚恳地向老年中医学习，对于老年中医的学术经验，那怕只有一点长处，都应该设法把它接受下来。总之，要做到尊师爱徒，双方亲密无间，才能教得好、学得好，收效显著。
    学习老年中医学术经验的方法可以多种多样，如采取拜师、座谈、个别谈心、口授记录等方法，其中应以拜师带徒为主。这样便于把他们的学术经验系统全面地接受下来。（摘自“新华日报”）
