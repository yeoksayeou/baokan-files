Not only plant more, but also plant well
Li Jiuzhe

Planting more is the prerequisite for harvesting more; however, planting more does not necessarily lead to harvesting more. If the planting is not done well, the management is not good, and the harvest is not successful, the goal of harvesting more will not be achieved. Only by planting well now, coupled with good management and harvesting in the future, can planting more lead to harvesting more. Simply pursuing high yields on small plots of land while neglecting to maintain a certain planting area is, of course, a kind of one-sidedness and cannot guarantee an increase in total output. Conversely, if one thinks that once the problem of planting more area is solved, there will be no problem with harvesting more, that is also a kind of one-sidedness and cannot guarantee an increase in total output.

The originally planned summer planting area in several regions this year was relatively small, but has recently been rapidly expanded. The rapid expansion of the planting area has brought some new problems to the summer planting work, such as insufficient fertilizer, insufficient seeds, and insufficient water sources. The preparation work for summer planting was originally based on a relatively small scale, but now that the scale has increased, all preparation work is required to keep up accordingly. And currently, all agricultural activities are very busy, and summer harvest and field management cannot be relaxed. Faced with this situation, a big question mark has appeared in the minds of some people regarding whether planting more can be done well.

From this, it seems that paying attention to the quality of summer planting while expanding the summer planting area is an urgent issue in the current work.

Planting more is for harvesting more, and to harvest more, one must first plant well. No one will object to this point. The current problem lies in how to plant well. Planting well is, of course, not an easy task. The area is large, the workload is large, and time is pressing, so there will certainly be many difficulties. Seeing the difficulties, presenting them one by one, letting the vast number of cadres and the masses discuss, analyze, and come up with ideas, the difficulties will be overcome one by one. What is to be feared is not seeing the difficulties, closing your eyes, and carelessly sowing the seeds in the field. That would be terrible!

Under the requirement of planting more, how can we ensure planting well? The news from Fuzhou Prefecture in Jiangxi Province provides good experience. This year, the summer planting area in Fuzhou Prefecture has increased by more than 500,000 mu, an expansion of 28% compared to the original plan. This is not a small proportion. The summer sowing work in this area is now basically completed, and the late rice transplanting has also been arranged properly. They saw the new situations and new problems in this year's summer planting work early on, and in response to these situations and problems, they took effective measures without hesitation and actively prepared in all aspects. This is good at observing the situation and making decisive decisions. If you cannot see the new problems in this year's summer planting work, thinking that everything is fine and well, then you will disarm ideologically and become paralyzed. If you see the new situations and new problems but cannot make decisive decisions and take measures, but are indecisive and wavering in the face of difficulties, you will miss the opportunity. The Party committees at all levels in Fuzhou Prefecture combined observing the situation and making decisive decisions, and proactively overcame various difficulties in summer planting and won the battle. Fuzhou Prefecture grasped the quality of summer planting in a timely manner and did a very good job. In the face of heavy tasks, many difficulties, and tight schedules, the issue of quality is most easily overlooked. Grasping this issue early, sounding the alarm to people, and raising awareness will win the initiative, save time, and prompt people to come up with ways to overcome difficulties and ensure quality.

To plant well and overcome the many difficulties in summer planting, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses. The correct leadership method is to gather from the masses and persist among the masses. Why must planting more be done well? How to plant well? What are the difficulties in planting well? How to overcome them? ... Leading cadres in various places in Fuzhou Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, took these questions to the broad masses for discussion and consultation, everyone contributed ideas and came up with solutions, thereby turning the requirement of planting more and planting well into the practical actions of the broad masses.

In order to ensure that planting more is done well, all localities must take different measures and put forward different requirements according to the progress of summer planting in their respective regions. In areas that are being planted, it is necessary to carefully prepare the land, apply sufficient base fertilizer, and plant each plot well. In areas that are preparing to plant, it is necessary to seize the time and actively prepare in terms of labor arrangements, fertilizer, and water conservancy, so as to create conditions for planting well. In areas that have already been planted, a general inspection of the sowing quality must be carried out, and remedial measures must be taken quickly for those with unsatisfactory sowing quality, and field management must be strengthened as soon as possible.

    既要多种　又要种好
    李久泽
    多种，是多收的前提；但多种的结果却不一定就是多收。如果种得不好，管得不好，收得不好，就达不到多收的目的。当前种好，再加上今后管好、收好，多种才能多收。单纯追求小片土地上的高额产量，而忽视保持一定的播种面积，当然是一种片面性，不能保证增加总产量；反之，如果认为多种的面积问题一解决，多收就没有问题了，那也同样是一种片面性，也不能保证增加总产量。
    若干地区今年原定的夏季播种计划面积较小，最近迅速扩大了。种植面积的迅速扩大，给夏种工作带来了一些新的问题，如肥料不足、种籽不够、水源不充分等等。夏种的准备工作原来是按照比较小的盘子打的，现在盘子大了，就要求各项准备工作相应地跟上来。而当前各项农事活动又非常繁忙，夏收和田间管理都不能放松。面对这种情况，对于多种能不能种好这样一个问题，在一些人的脑子里出现了一个很大的问号。
    由此看来，在扩大夏种面积的同时注意夏种质量，是当前工作中的一个迫切问题。
    多种是为了多收，要多收首先必须种好。这一点是不会有人反对的。目前的问题出在怎样才能种好。种好，当然不是十分容易的事。面积大，工作量大，时间又紧迫，当然会有不少困难。看到了困难，把它们一个个摆出来，交给广大干部和群众去讨论，去分析，去想办法出主意，困难就会一个个被克服。就怕看不到困难，闭着眼睛，马马虎虎把种籽播在田里。那就糟了！
    在多种的要求下，怎样才能保证种好呢？江西省抚州专区的消息提供了很好的经验。抚州专区今年夏种面积增加了五十多万亩，比原计划扩大28％。这是个不小的比例。这个专区现在夏播工作基本结束，晚稻栽插也安排停当。他们及早地看到了今年夏种工作中的新情况、新问题，针对这些情况和问题，毫不犹豫地采取了有效措施，从各方面积极准备。这就是善观形势，当机立断。如果看不到今年夏种工作中的新的问题，以为太平无事，一切都好，那就会在思想上解除了武装，麻痹起来。如果看到了新的情况、新的问题，却不能当机立断，采取措施，而是优柔寡断，在困难之中摇摆不定，那就会坐失时机。抚州专区各级党委把观察形势和当机立断结合起来，就主动地克服了夏种中的各种困难，打了胜仗。抚州专区及时地抓夏种的质量，抓得很好。在任务重、困难多、时间紧的情况下，质量问题最易被人忽视。及早抓这个问题，向人们敲起警钟，提起注意，这就争得了主动，赢得了时间，促使人们想出办法，克服困难，保证质量。
    要种好，要克服夏种中的许多困难，必须发动群众，依靠群众。正确的领导方法是从群众中集中起来，又到群众中坚持下去。多种为什么必须种好？怎样种好？要种好有什么困难？怎样克服？……江西抚州专区各地领导干部把这些问题拿到广大群众中去讨论，和广大群众商量，大家出主意想办法，从而把多种而又种好的要求变成了广大群众的实际行动。
    为了保证种多种好，各地要根据本地区夏种的进展情况，采取不同的措施，提出不同的要求。正在种的地区，必须精细整地、施足底肥，块块种好。正在准备种的地区，必须争取时间，积极做好劳力安排、肥料、水利等方面的准备工作，为种好创造条件。已经种下的地区，要普遍检查一次播种质量，对播种质量不合要求的，迅速采取补救措施，及早加强田间管理。
