    Learning from This Good Experience
    In the new circumstances after communization, how to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of rural Party branches over grassroots work, and how to give full play to their role as fighting fortresses in various practical tasks, is a new question. Everyone is exploring experiences. The experience of the Party branch of the Dong Ziyan Production Team of Chengguan Commune in Xinle, which relies closely on Party members and the masses and does everything possible to do a good job in Party work, is a relatively good experience and worthy of reference and learning by all production team Party branches. We firmly believe that in practical work, there will be more vivid and better experiences than those introduced here. We hope that the Party committees of all communes will pay attention to summarizing them in a timely manner and earnestly promote them. In this way, the work of Party branches will have a greater leap forward.

    学习这个好经验
    在公社化以后的新情况下，如何加强农村党支部对基层工作的政治思想领导，如何充分发挥它在各项实际工作中的战斗堡垒作用，这是个新问题。大家都在探索经验。今天介绍的新乐城关公社东紫烟生产队党支部紧紧依靠党员群众、千方百计作好党的工作的经验，是个比较好的经验，值得所有生产队党支部参考和学习。我们深信，在实际工作中，一定会有比这里介绍的更生动更好的经验，希望各公社党委注意及时总结，认真推广。这样，党的支部工作就会有更大的跃进。
