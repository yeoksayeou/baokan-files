　　Kishi Nobusuke's Clumsy Propaganda

　　The Kishi Nobusuke government has recently been vigorously promoting that Japanese diplomacy has reached a turning point from "occupied diplomacy" to "completely independent diplomacy," and saying that this is because the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will elevate Japan's position in international politics from a position of "being forced to cooperate with the United States" to one of "voluntarily cooperating with the United States."

　　This is a clumsy and deceptive propaganda that exploits the patriotic sentiments of the Japanese people to sell the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The meaning is that we should not oppose but should support the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Only in this way can Japan end its semi-occupied status and achieve "complete independence." The Kishi Nobusuke group has gone to any length to undermine the domestic people's struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　However, the facts are so merciless. According to the draft of the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" published by Kishi Nobusuke, not only can the U.S. military legally occupy Japan for a long time, but Japan will also step up its nuclear armament, send troops abroad, and cooperate with the U.S. military in combat under the guise of "strengthening self-defense" and "opposing aggression," which means making Japan more dangerously tied to the U.S. war chariot. May I ask, at this time, what "complete independence" does Japan have, and what ending of Japan's "occupied diplomacy" can be spoken of?

　　As for Kishi Nobusuke, his current policy of selling out national interests and acting as an accomplice to the United States' aggression in Asia cannot be described as "forced cooperation with the United States." Therefore, wouldn't it be more consistent with the facts to say that Kishi Nobusuke will be more "willing" – that is, more unscrupulous – to "cooperate with the United States" after the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," step by step burying Japan in the fire pit of the United States' aggressive war?

　　The likes of Kishi Nobusuke are clearly trying to turn the Japanese people's increasingly strong patriotism into chauvinism that supports militarism. But how far is this intention from the common aspirations of the Japanese people today?

### 岸信介的拙劣宣传

    岸信介的拙劣宣传
    岸信介政府最近大肆宣传日本外交已经到达了一个从“被占领外交”过渡到“完全独立外交”的转折点，并说这是因为修改日美“安全条约”将使日本在国际政治中的地位，从“被迫同美国合作”的地位提高到“自愿同美国合作”的地位。
    这是利用日本人民的爱国情绪，贩卖修改美日“安全条约”的一种拙劣的欺骗宣传。意思是说，不要反对而且应该支持修改美日“安全条约”，只有这样，日本才可以结束被半占领状态，取得“完全独立”。岸信介集团为了瓦解国内人民反对修改美日“安全条约”的斗争，可谓到了不择手段的地步了。
    然而，事实却是那末无情，根据岸信介公布的修改后的日美“安全条约”草案，不仅美军可以合法地长期占领日本，而且还要使日本在“加强自卫”、“反对侵略”的种种幌子下，加紧进行核武装、派兵出国、协同美军作战，也就是使日本更危险地绑在美国战车上。试问，到了这个时候，日本还有什么“完全独立”，结束日本的“被占领外交”可言？
    至于对岸信介来说，他目前推行的出卖民族利益、充当美国侵略亚洲的帮凶的政策，根本谈不上什么“被迫同美国合作”。因此，岸信介在修改美日“安全条约”后会更“自愿”——也就是更加肆无忌惮——“同美国合作”，一步一步地把日本葬送在美国侵略战争的火坑里去，这样说不是更符合事实吗？
    岸信介之流显然竭力想把日本人民的日益强烈的爱国主义变为拥护军国主义的沙文主义。但是，这种打算距离目前日本人民的普遍愿望有多么远啊。
