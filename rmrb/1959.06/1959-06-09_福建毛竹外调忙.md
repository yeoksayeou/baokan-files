Fujian is busily transferring large quantities of *Phyllostachys pubescens* bamboo to support key construction projects in other provinces. By the end of May, it had transferred 2.5 million bamboo poles to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hebei, Sichuan, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Shandong and other places, an increase of about 40% over the same period last year.

Fujian Province ranks first in the country in bamboo production. In order to meet the needs of industrial and mining construction and fishery and salt production in many provinces and cities, the counties in the northwest Fujian mountainous area have transferred manpower to the mountains to cut and transport bamboo during the busy spring plowing season. Nearly ten thousand workers have also been sent from Shanghai, Zhejiang and other provinces and cities to assist. In the process of cutting and transporting, the workers used aerial ropeways and other methods to overcome the difficulties of high mountains, dense forests, and inconvenient transportation, and concentrated the bamboo to the Yingxia Railway line. At present, the counties in the mountainous areas are continuing to organize manpower to cut and transport bamboo, striving to provide more support for the construction of various provinces.

    福建毛竹外调忙
    福建省调运大批毛竹支援省外重点建设。到五月底止，已经调给北京、天津、上海、河北、四川、辽宁、浙江和山东等地毛竹二百五十万根，比去年同期增加40％左右。
    福建省竹子产量居全国第一位。为了适应很多省、市工矿建设和渔、盐生产的需要，今年闽西北山区各县在春耕大忙中都抽调了人力上山砍运毛竹。上海、浙江等省、市也派来近万名工人协助。在砍运中，工人们用架空索道等办法，克服了山高林密、运输不便的困难，把毛竹集运到鹰厦铁路沿线。目前，山区各县正在继续组织人力砍运毛竹，力争更多地支援各省建设。（附图片）
