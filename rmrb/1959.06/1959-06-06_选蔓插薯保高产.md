Sweet potato is a relatively high-yielding crop, but according to an investigation by the Institute of Genetics and Crop Cultivation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, there has been a downward trend in yield in recent years. This reduction in yield is due to the mixing of low-yielding types of sweet potato varieties with superior varieties. A prominent characteristic of the low-yielding varieties is their thin, long vines, which is especially noticeable in the "Victory No. 100" variety, which is currently the most widely promoted in China. According to a comparison of forty-two survey materials from Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, and other places, the thin, long-vine, low-yielding types yielded an average of 30% less than the thick, short-vine types. During a field visit organized by Pinggu County in the autumn of 1958, a comparison of forty-eight sweet potato plants showed that the thick, short-vine types yielded 43.2%—47.1% more. In addition to "Victory No. 100", other superior sweet potato varieties, such as "North China No. 166" and "Ningyuan No. 30 Early", also have the same problem of being mixed with low-yielding types.

For several years, these instances have not been widely recognized, which is a serious problem threatening the improvement of sweet potato yields; even more dangerous is that the number of low-yielding types of sweet potatoes is increasing, and the area of distribution is expanding. According to a survey in the suburbs of Beijing, low-yielding types of plants accounted for about 60% in 1956, but in 1958, they reached more than 90% in many areas. Last year, during the upsurge of agricultural production leaps, many regions also transferred a large number of seed potatoes and seed vines to support neighboring areas, which obviously increased the chances of spreading low-yielding varieties. Therefore, if attention is not paid to this issue early and measures are not taken to prevent it, a serious reduction in yield will inevitably occur.

If the thin, long-vine, low-yielding varieties reduce yield by an average of 30%, and the average yield per mu is calculated at three thousand catties, then each mu will produce nine hundred catties less. If this is calculated based on 100 million mu nationwide, the total yield reduction would be about 90 billion catties. This is a considerable and alarming figure! Therefore, it is extremely important to actively promote the selection of thick, short vines for seed saving in sweet potatoes.

Since the vines of low-yielding sweet potato varieties are relatively thin and long, this is their most prominent characteristic and also the easiest for the masses to identify. Therefore, once the selection technology is explained, it will be quickly grasped by the masses. At present, many people's communes have established specialized seed organizations, which are favorable conditions for carrying out this work. In sweet potato producing areas, if the leadership of this work is strengthened and organized and promoted in a timely manner, there will be positive results.

Now is the time to plant or prepare to plant summer sweet potatoes, and the leadership of this work should be strengthened.

    选蔓插薯保高产
    金熙彬
    甘薯是一种比较高产的作物，但是根据中国科学院遗传栽培研究室的调查，发现近年来已有减产趋势。减产是由于甘薯的优良品种中混杂着低产类型薯种而造成的。低产种突出的特征是蔓细而长，尤其是在目前我国推广最多面积最大的胜利百号良种中更为显著。据在辽宁、河北、山东、湖南等地四十二个调查材料比较结果，细长蔓低产类型比粗短蔓的平均减产30％。1958年秋季平谷县组织现场参观的时候，两次共刨四十八棵甘薯，对比结果，粗短蔓的增产43.2％—47.1％。除胜利百号以外，其他如华北一百六十六、宁远三十早等甘薯良种中，也有同样混杂着低产种的情况。
    几年来，这些事例还没有被广泛地引起重视，这是威胁甘薯产量提高的严重问题；更危险的是低产类型薯种还在日益增多，地区范围也在扩大。据在北京市郊区调查，1956年低产类型的植株约占60％，而1958年却有很多地段已达90％以上了。去年在掀起农业生产跃进的高潮中，不少地区又大量调剂了种薯、种蔓支援邻近地区，显然地增加了低产种的传布机会。因此，如不及早引起重视，设法防止，势将形成严重的减产局面。
    如果细长蔓低产种平均减产30％，以平均亩产三千斤计算，每亩要少产九百斤，全国若以一亿亩推算，减产总数约为九百亿斤。这是一个相当庞大惊人的数字！因此，积极推广甘薯选粗短蔓留种的工作是十分重要的。
    由于低产种甘薯的蔓子比较细而长，这是它最突出的特征，也是最容易被广大群众识别出来的。所以，在选种技术上一经说明，就会很快地为群众所掌握。目前很多人民公社，大部建立了种籽专业组织，更是开展这项工作的有利条件。在甘薯产区，如果加强这项工作的领导，及时加以组织推动，是会有积极效果的。
    目前正是栽插或准备栽插夏薯的时候，应该加强对这一工作的领导。
