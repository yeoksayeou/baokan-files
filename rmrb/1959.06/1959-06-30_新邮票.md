    New Stamps
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will issue a set of commemorative stamps for the 40th Anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement on July 1st. There are two denominations, four fen and eight fen. Both designs use the 1919 "May Fourth" Movement as the background. The first picture shows the advancing Chinese revolutionary youth under the glorious banner of Marxism-Leninism in the foreground; the second picture features the heroic advancement of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The stamps are printed in three-color photogravure.
