Catch More Freshwater Fish
Commentator of this newspaper

Freshwater production mainly includes two aspects: one is the breeding of aquatic animals and plants; the other is the capture of natural aquatic products. Breeding is the main aspect and the basis of capture; carrying out large-scale breeding work is the most important factor for the high-speed development of aquatic production. However, capture production should not be ignored. The fish bred will eventually be captured; some large rivers and lakes cannot be used for breeding, so it is even more necessary to actively develop capture production.

Our inland areas have many famous rivers and lakes. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers stretch for thousands of kilometers, and Taihu Lake, Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, Hongze Lake, etc., are vast with areas of over a million mu. Medium-sized rivers, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs are too numerous to count. These waters contain extremely rich aquatic resources. Famous and valuable fish such as black carp, grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, Chinese sturgeon, Yellow River carp, whitebait, and chum salmon are abundant in these rivers and lakes. Actively catching these fish is extremely important for increasing production, increasing the income of people's communes, and meeting the supply of aquatic products in the market.

In recent months, Party committees and governments at all levels have further strengthened their leadership over aquatic production; many places have allocated the necessary labor force in aquatic production and stipulated reasonable labor remuneration; the masses understand the importance of vigorously developing aquatic production at present, and their enthusiasm for production is very high. Our fishermen have accumulated rich fishing experience and have also created a variety of fishing gear and methods, capable of catching various fish, shrimps, and shellfish; after some areas carried out net reform, the capture efficiency has been significantly improved. These are the most fundamental and favorable conditions for developing capture production in rivers and lakes.

From the production perspective, now is a favorable time for river and lake capture; from the perspective of market needs, there is also an urgent need to increase the supply of aquatic products. Now the peak season for fish production in many coastal areas has passed or is about to pass, and freshwater-bred fish are growing and are not suitable for harvesting. In this situation, on the one hand, more labor and fishing gear can be invested in large and medium-sized river and lake capture production; on the other hand, the capture production of large and medium-sized rivers and lakes is also more important for meeting the needs of supplying aquatic products to the market. It is necessary to seize the opportunity, act immediately, organize the vast number of fishermen, muster all their energy, work hard and cleverly to fish and harvest in large rivers and lakes, and strive for a bumper harvest.

Currently, to fully develop river and lake capture production, the most important thing is to organize and arrange the labor force. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and the Hubei Provincial Party Committee have already proposed the policy of "pure fishermen still engage in fishing, half-fishermen and half-farmers still engage in half-fishing and half-farming, and those who have switched to other industries should quickly return to their teams" to arrange the labor force. In areas where aquatic production is concentrated, labor should be reasonably arranged to fully utilize labor potential, increase the number of fishermen, and improve production efficiency. In addition to organizing commercial departments to supply the necessary materials for capture production, the main thing should be to mobilize the masses to raise funds locally, and to adopt good and economical methods to widely use substitutes.

In order to better develop river and lake capture production, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out technological reform and tool reform on the basis of existing fishing technology and net production. Most of the current nets and technologies have been gradually improved by the vast number of fishermen in long-term production labor, and must be given due attention and their potential must be fully exploited. This is the main aspect at present. However, it should also be pointed out that some nets and operating methods are only suitable for individual operations, with high labor intensity and low yields, which are not compatible with the current collective production and must be reformed by mobilizing the masses. Advanced nets and advanced operating methods that have proven effective should be vigorously promoted. In marine capture production, many advanced fishing gear and methods have been created in recent years, which should be absorbed and applied to river and lake capture production with analysis and selection. Regions with conditions should gradually move capture production towards mechanization and semi-mechanization.

Third, while vigorously developing river and lake capture production, we must continue to pay attention to the reproduction and protection of production resources. This is extremely important for the development of aquatic production. Excessively damaging resources will affect production in the next year or even longer. The fishing ban areas and fishing ban periods rationally determined in the past based on the spawning areas and spawning seasons of fish must be strictly observed. Nets that seriously damage young fish must be effectively improved or banned. Of course, it is unnecessary and detrimental to production to劃定禁漁區禁漁期 over excessively large or long periods. It should be done in such a way that the fish yield can be greatly increased without damaging the reproduction of aquatic resources. We must combine the current interests with the long-term interests very well.

    捕捞更多的淡水鱼类
    本报评论员
    淡水生产主要包括两个方面：一是养殖水产动物植物；一是捕捞天然水产。养殖是主要的，是捕捞的基础；大规模的开展养殖工作，是高速度发展水产生产的最重要的因素。但是，对捕捞生产也不可忽视。养殖的鱼类最后总是要捕捞的；一些大型的江、河、湖泊，不能进行养殖生产，更必须积极发展捕捞生产。
    我国内陆地区有许多著名的大江大河和湖泊。长江、黄河浩浩荡荡长达数千公里，太湖、鄱阳湖、洞庭湖、洪泽湖等等烟波浩淼，面积在百万亩以上。中型的河荡、湖泊、水库更不胜枚举。这些水里蕴藏着极其丰富的水产资源。著名的青鱼、草鱼、鲢鱼、鳙鱼、鲥鱼、黄河鲤鱼、银鱼、大马哈鱼等等名贵鱼类，都盛产于这些江河湖泊里。积极捕捞这些鱼类，无论对增加生产，增加人民公社收入和满足市场水产品的供应，都是极其重要的。
    近几个月，各级党委和政府进一步加强了对水产生产的领导；许多地方在水产方面调配了必要的劳动力，规定了合理的劳动报酬；群众了解了当前大力发展水产生产的重要性，生产积极性很高。我国渔民积累了丰富的捕鱼经验，也创造出多种多样的渔具、渔法，能捕捞各种鱼、虾贝类；有些地区进行网具改革以后，捕捞效率显著提高。这些都是发展江河湖泊的捕捞生产的最根本的有利条件。
    从生产方面来看，当前正是江湖捕捞的有利时机；从市场需要方面来说，当前也迫切需要增加水产供应。现在沿海许多地区鱼类的旺季生产已经过去或即将过去，淡水养殖的鱼类正在成长，也不宜起塘。在这情况下，一方面，可以有更多劳动力和捕鱼工具投入大、中型江河湖泊捕捞生产；另方面，大中型江河湖泊的捕捞生产，对供应市场水产品的需要，也显得更为重要了。必须抓紧时机，立即行动起来，组织广大渔民，鼓足干劲，苦干巧干在江河湖泊中大捕大捞，力争大丰收。
    当前要充分地发展江湖捕捞生产，最要紧的还是组织安排劳动力。江苏省委、湖北省委已经提出“纯渔民仍务渔、半渔半农仍半渔半农，已转业的迅速归队”等安排劳动力的方针。在水产生产集中地区，都应该合理安排劳动力，充分发挥劳动潜力，增加捕鱼人员，提高生产效率。捕捞生产必需的物资，除了组织商业部门供应外，主要应该发动群众，就地筹集，并且要采取又好又省的办法，广泛使用代用品。
    为了更好地发展江湖捕捞生产，还要在现有捕鱼技术和网具生产的基础上，大力开展技术改革和工具改革。现在的一些网具和技术，大都是广大渔民在长期生产劳动中逐年改进而形成的，必须予以应有的重视，并充分发挥其潜力，在当前这是主要的一方面。但是，还应该指出：有些网具和操作方法只适宜于个体经营的生产，劳动强度大，收获量低，和当前的集体生产是不相适应的，必须发动群众加以改革。对一些行之有效的先进网具和先进操作方法，应当大力推广。在海洋捕捞生产上，最近几年创造了许多先进的渔具和渔法，应该有分析有选择地加以吸收，应用到江湖捕捞生产上来，有条件的地区，应该使捕捞生产逐步走向机械化和半机械化。
    第三，在大力开展江湖捕捞生产同时，要继续注意生产资源的繁殖和保护。这对发展水产生产是极其重要的。过分地损害资源，就会影响下一年度甚至更长时期的生产。过去根据鱼类的产卵地区和产卵季节合理地确定的禁渔区、禁渔期，必须切实遵守。对一些严重损害幼鱼的网具，必须切实改进或取缔。当然，把禁渔区禁渔期划得过大过长，是不必要的，对生产也是不利的。应该做到：既能大量增加鱼产量，又不损害水产资源的繁殖。要把当前利益和长远利益很好地结合起来。
