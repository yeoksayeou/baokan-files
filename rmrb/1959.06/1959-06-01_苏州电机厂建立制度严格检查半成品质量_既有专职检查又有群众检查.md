Suzhou Electric Motor Factory Establishes System to Strictly Inspect Quality of Semi-Finished Products
　　Both Dedicated Inspection and Mass Inspection

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch) The Suzhou Electric Motor Factory has established a system in each production process for mass self-inspection and mutual inspection of parts quality. It has also strengthened the work of dedicated inspection personnel, ensuring that the quality of each electric motor and transformer produced meets the standards stipulated by the state.

This factory was a small factory established in the second half of last year. Originally, it only had a finished product testing group led by the Production Technology Section, responsible for the factory inspection of finished products. However, there were no full-time inspectors in the production process, nor was there a mass quality inspection system, resulting in a large amount of rework and repair of semi-finished products. During this increase production and practice economy movement, while establishing a mass quality inspection system in the production process, the inspection work of dedicated personnel was strengthened. Because the metalworking workshop has many production processes, complex parts processing, high technical requirements, and many new workers, a skilled worker was selected to serve as a full-time inspector, inspecting the quality of semi-finished products and helping solve some of the difficulties encountered by workers in processing technology. The finished product testing group strictly implements the inspection system. All assembled finished products must undergo various performance verifications and are only allowed to leave the factory after passing the verification.

In April, the factory's leading cadres organized employees to discuss cases of transformer oil leakage and electric motor coil burnout. During the discussion, it was unanimously recognized that the electric motors and transformers produced by the factory were all supporting parts for irrigation and drainage, mining, and coking equipment, which are directly related to industrial and agricultural production. The workers unanimously expressed that they would not only guarantee the completion of product quantity but also ensure product quality. Workers in each workshop and group proposed to ensure the quality of the factory's products by improving the quality of their own parts.

On the basis of raising awareness, the employees further discussed measures and systems to improve the quality of parts. The workshops successively established self-inspection and mutual inspection systems for the quality of semi-finished products in each process. It is stipulated that each worker must first inspect a part that they make themselves, and then submit it to the group leader for inspection. The group leader submits it to the next process for inspection after passing the inspection. In this way, if a defective product part appears, the cause can be identified in time for improvement. Wire wrapping workers strictly implement the system of only processing qualified semi-finished products. A batch of copper wires with uneven thickness was found and returned to the wire drawing factory for reprocessing and rectification, avoiding serious quality accidents caused by uneven copper wire thickness. The workers also actively improved equipment and tools to improve product quality.

Due to the implementation of the above measures, the number of repaired parts has been greatly reduced during this period, and the speed of finished product assembly and manufacturing has been accelerated. From the beginning of April to May 13th, in more than a month, 114 electric motors and 11 transformers of various capacities were produced, and all passed the inspection.

    苏州电机厂建立制度严格检查半成品质量
    既有专职检查又有群众检查
    本报南京31日电　苏州电机厂每道生产工序都建立了群众性自检、互查零件质量的制度，并且加强了专职检查人员的工作，使生产的每台电动机、变压器的质量都达到国家规定的标准。
    这个厂是去年下半年建立起来的一个小型工厂，原来只有生产技术科领导的成品试验小组，负责成品的出厂检验；但是生产过程中没有专职检验员，也没有群众性的质量检查制度，因而半制品的返工回修较多。在这次增产节约运动中，在建立生产过程中的群众性质量检查制度的同时，加强了专职人员的检验工作。金工车间由于生产工序多，加工零件复杂，技术要求高，新工人多，便选拔了一名技术工人担任专职检验员，巡回检查半制品质量，并且帮助解决工人在加工技术方面遇到的一些困难。成品试验组严格执行检查制度，凡装配好的成品都要进行各种性能的校验，经过校验合格才允许出厂。
    4月份，厂的领导干部组织职工针对个别变压器漏油、电动机烧坏线圈等事例，进行了讨论。讨论中一致认识到，本厂生产的电动机、变压器全部是排灌和矿山、炼焦设备的配套件，对工农业生产有直接关系。工人们一致表示不仅要保证完成产品数量，还要确保产品质量。各车间、小组工人都提出要从提高自己的零件质量中保证全厂产品质量。
    在提高认识的基础上，职工们进一步讨论了提高零部件质量的措施、制度。各车间相继建立了各道工序的自己检查和互相检查半制品质量的制度，规定每个工人做好一个零部件必须自己先行检验，然后交小组长检查。小组长检查合格再交下道工序检查。这样产品零件一出废品，就可以及时查明原因进行改进。包线工人严格执行合格半制品才加工的制度，检查出一批粗细不匀的铜丝，就退回拉丝厂重行加工整理，避免因为铜丝粗细不匀而引起严重质量事故。工人们还积极改进设备、工具，提高产品质量。
    由于实行了上述办法，这个时期，返修零件大大减少，成品装配和制造速度加快。从4月初到5月13日的一个多月中，生产的各种容积的电动机一百十四台、变压器十一台，经检验全部合格。
