    Rockefeller is a Vampire of African Labor

    Editor's Note: The American "Workers' Weekly" published an article by Art Shields on April 19 entitled "Rockefeller Extracts Profits from Forced Labor in Africa," exposing the truth of how Rockefeller made a fortune by cruelly exploiting African labor.

    Governor Nelson Rockefeller extracts profits from forced labor in Africa all year round. Some of this blood money comes from the Congo, where many workers were recently massacred. Some comes from the mines of Rhodesia. Some comes from Kenya. Soon, more money will be coming from South Africa. Rockefeller, who signed anti-union bills in Albany a few weeks ago, receives these gifts from forced labor.

    Tycoon Extracts the Biggest Profit from the Congo

    The profits from the Congo are particularly high. After the war, the Rockefeller family invested huge amounts of capital in the copper and uranium mines of the Congo. These mines have astonishingly rich reserves and are exploited using forced labor.

    Most of Governor Rockefeller's profits from the Congo come from the mining monopoly "Union Minière du Haut-Katanga." This company flies the flag of the Belgian royal family. However, it also uses a lot of Anglo-American money, and it uses tens of thousands of laborers forced to work in the mines to exploit the colonial mineral wealth. They must work for the "Union Minière" in order to earn money to pay the poll tax, otherwise they will be imprisoned.

    The mine's labor camp is like a prison. Miners are fingerprinted upon entering the camp and are monitored like prisoners until the end of their labor term. Uranium miners entering the Shinkolobwe mine must sign a three-year contract, which is the source of most of the fuel for Eisenhower's terror bombs.

    Copper miners also have a three-year contract. Miners accused of violating the contract by the mine bosses will be fined or imprisoned. Miners leaving on their own means an extension of their prison term.

    Mortality Rate in Labor Camps is Alarmingly High

    The miner's children also engage in debt bondage labor. Ten-year-old boys must do three hours of odd jobs in the labor camp every day. They are full-time workers at the age of twelve, so it is no wonder that the mortality rate is alarmingly high.

    Take a look at the death register. The company admits that in 1944 (the last year for which death statistics were published) 111 infants per 1,000 died in the "Union Minière" labor camp. Forty out of every thousand babies were stillborn. But the pious Mr. Rockefeller does not say a word about this phenomenon, while profits continue to pour in.

    Governor Rockefeller's family entered the "Union Minière" through a side door. They invested heavily in a British holding company ("Union Minière's" big boss in 1950). This British company is Tanganyika Concessions Limited - a powerful company that exploits African minerals. Rockefeller's agents won positions on the board of directors of this company. This deal was conducted by Nelson Rockefeller's brother, David, and the International Basic Economy Corporation. The International Basic Economy Corporation is a Rockefeller family company, and Nelson is their manager. The Rockefeller brothers also partially own 300,000 square kilometers of mining leases in the Lower Congo. Extensive exploration work is underway there.

    They also opened a huge textile factory in the Congo.

    Breaking into Kenya and Northern Rhodesia

    The governor, who increased taxes in New York State, is also interested in Kenya, which is ruled by white immigrants through terror. His family, through Tanganyika Concessions Limited, shared control of Kenya's largest and oldest mining company, Kentan.

    Rockefeller's profits also come from the sweating and discriminated copper miners in Northern Rhodesia, near the Congolese border. The Rockefeller family is second only to Morgan's company in this respect. But Rockefeller's company is very rich in capital.

    Rockefeller invested capital in American Metal Company, which owns 50.56% of the interests in a large British holding company controlling the copper mines in Northern Rhodesia. John Foster Dulles (Rockefeller's lawyer) served as the lawyer for American Metal Company for many years.

    The miners of Northern Rhodesia are under the rule of the brutal Prime Minister Welensky of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. This white supremacist is indeed covered in blood.

    Colluding with the South African Colonial Government

    The Governor's family is now extending forcefully into the Union of South Africa - a country that practices apartheid.

    This trip for financiers was conducted by Nelson Rockefeller's brother, David. David is the deputy manager of the Manhattan Chase Bank of this $7 billion oil family. David traveled to Africa for five weeks earlier this year and opened a Chase Bank branch in Johannesburg (the center of gold mines).

    One of David's assistants said that more Chase Bank branches will be opened in South Africa. They will be located in Cape Town, Durban, and one or two other cities in South Africa. Chase Bank branches may also be established in Rhodesia and other places. More dollars will pour into South Africa, where 126 American companies are already operating today.

    David Rockefeller has shown his concern for the rising tide of the struggle for African freedom. He calls it "nationalism," but he asked his white friends not to worry. He told them that dollars would continue to flow into Africa.

    The Rockefeller family is colluding with white supremacists in South Africa. At the same time, they are working with white British capitalists and officials who persecute black people. They close their eyes to the whipping, imprisonment, and disenfranchisement that occur in this pro-fascist country.

    The Rockefeller family is colluding with white imperialists in North Africa, South Africa, and Central Africa. They are doing everything they can to ensure France's victory in Algeria, where Mobil Oil has huge oil leases. They provide this assistance to France through the Eisenhower administration under their control.

    They also share control of more than 100 million acres of oilfield leases in Libya, Somaliland, and British Somaliland. Their agent there is Ohio Oil Company.

    Laborers wherever the Rockefeller family's footprints have reached, please be careful and beware.

### 洛克菲勒是非洲劳工的吸血鬼

专栏：外论摘要

    洛克菲勒是非洲劳工的吸血鬼
    编者按　4月19日美国“工人周报”以“洛克菲勒从非洲的强迫劳工攫取利润”为题发表阿尔特·薛尔斯的一篇文章，揭露了洛克菲勒靠残酷榨取非洲劳工发财的真相。
    纳尔逊·洛克菲勒州长一年四季地从非洲强迫劳工中攫取利润。这种血汗钱有些来自最近许多工人被残杀的刚果。有些来自罗得西亚的矿山。有些来自怯尼亚。不久还要有更多的钱来自南非。洛克菲勒几星期以前在阿尔巴尼签署了反工会的法案，他就得到这种强迫劳工的献礼。
    财主从刚果取得最大利润
    刚果的利润特别高。战后洛克菲勒家族对刚果的铜矿和铀矿投入了巨额资本。这些矿山的蕴藏量惊人地富裕，而且是利用强迫劳工来开采的。
    洛克菲勒州长从刚果获得的利润大多数来自采矿垄断资本“上加丹加矿业联合公司”。这个公司挂的是比利时皇家的旗帜。但是它也使用英美很多的钱，它利用强迫到矿山去劳动的上万的劳工来开采这个殖民地的矿藏财富。他们必须为“矿业联合公司”工作以便挣钱交纳人头税，不然就得坐牢。
    矿山的劳动营就像一个监狱一样。矿工入营的时候要打手印，在劳动期限满期以前就像囚犯一样地被人监视。铀矿矿工进入香科洛韦矿山就得签订三年的合同，那里是艾森豪威尔恐怖炸弹大多数燃料的来源地。
    铜矿矿工的合同也是三年。被矿山老板控告违反合同的矿工就会被判处罚款或监禁。矿工自行离开就意味着徒刑期限延长。
    劳动营的死亡率高得惊人
    矿工的子女也要从事还债劳动。十岁的男孩就必须每天在劳动营作三小时的零工。他们在十二岁就是全日工人，无怪乎死亡率是高得惊人的。
    请看看死亡登记册吧。公司承认在1944年（发表死亡统计数字的最后一年）在“矿业联合公司”的劳动营里每一千个婴儿就有一百一十一个婴儿死亡。在每一千个婴儿中有四十个是死产。但是虔诚的洛克菲勒先生对这种现象却不置一词，而利润则不断涌进。
  洛克菲勒州长的家族是从旁门进入“矿业联合公司”的。他们对一家英国控股公司（“矿业联合公司”在1950年的大老板）投入大量资本。这家英国公司是坦噶尼喀特许有限公司——一家雄厚的开采非洲矿产的公司。洛克菲勒的代理人在这个公司内赢得了董事的职位。这笔交易是纳尔逊·洛克菲勒的哥哥戴维和国际基本经济公司所进行的。国际基本经济公司是洛克菲勒家族的一个公司，纳尔逊是它们的经理。洛克菲勒兄弟也部分地拥有下刚果占地三十万平方公里的矿山租借地。正在那里进行广泛的勘探工作。
    他们也在刚果开了一家巨大的纺织厂。
    打入怯尼亚和北罗得西亚
    这位在纽约州增加赋税的州长对于白种移民以恐怖手段进行统治的怯尼亚也感兴趣。他的家族通过坦噶尼喀特许有限公司而分享了怯尼亚最大的历史悠久的矿业公司——肯坦公司的控制权。
    洛克菲勒的利润还来自刚果边境附近北罗得西亚的汗流夹背并受到歧视的铜矿矿工。洛克菲勒家族在这方面仅次于摩根的公司。但是洛克菲勒的公司是资本非常雄厚的。
    洛克菲勒把资本投入美国金属公司，这家公司在控制北罗得西亚铜矿的一家大的英国控股公司中拥有50.56％的利益。约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯（洛克菲勒的律师）曾多年任美国金属公司的律师。
    北罗得西亚的矿工们是在罗得西亚—尼亚萨兰联邦的残暴总理韦伦斯基的统治之下。这个白人至上主义者确是双手沾满了鲜血。
  同南非殖民政府勾结在一起
    州长的家族现在正声势浩大地伸入南非联邦——一个实行种族隔离的国家。
    金融家这次旅行活动是由纳尔逊·洛克菲勒的兄弟戴维所进行的。戴维是这个拥有七十亿美元资本的石油家族的曼哈顿大通银行的副经理。戴维在本年初曾在非洲作了为时五周的旅行并在约翰内斯堡（金矿中心）开设了一家大通银行分行。
    戴维的一个助理人员说，还要在南非开设更多的大通银行分行。它们将设在开普敦、德班和南非其他一两个城市之中。在罗得西亚和其他的地方也可能设立大通银行的分行。更多的美元将涌入南非，今天在那里已有一百二十六家美国公司在营业。
    戴维·洛克菲勒表明了他对争取非洲自由的日益高涨的潮流的关切。他称之为“民族主义”，但是他要求白人朋友不用担忧。他对他们表示美元将继续流入非洲。
    洛克菲勒家族与南非的白人至上主义者是勾结在一起的。同时他们又与白种英国资本家和迫害黑人的官员们一起工作。他们闭着眼睛不看这个亲法西斯的国家所发生的鞭打、监禁和褫夺公权的种种现象。
    洛克菲勒家族与北非、南非和中非的白种帝国主义者勾结在一起。他们正在作力所能及的一切事情使法国在美孚油公司拥有巨大石油租借地的阿尔及利亚取得胜利。他们通过在他们控制下的艾森豪威尔政府给予法国这种援助。
    他们在利比亚、索马里兰和英属索马里兰也分享了一亿多亩的油田租借地的控制权。他们在那里的代理人是俄亥俄石油公司。
    在凡是洛克菲勒家族足迹所到的地方的劳工们，请你们小心提防吧。
