    Nehru Requests
    Reopening of the International Commission for Laos Meeting
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 2nd: Indian Information Service reported on June 1st: According to agency dispatches from Geneva, Prime Minister Nehru, following certain incidents in Laos, has requested the reconvening of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos.
    The report stated: Prime Minister Nehru made this request in letters to British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko. Nehru's letters were delivered in Geneva on May 31st to Lloyd and Gromyko, who were in Geneva, by the Indian Consul-General in Geneva.
    The International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos was established in accordance with the Geneva Accords on Laos signed in 1954. The member states of the commission include India, Canada, and Poland, with the chairmanship held by a representative from India. The commission's task is to oversee and supervise the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. In July 1958, due to the insistence of the Canadian representative, the commission passed a resolution to adjourn indefinitely. The subsequent Phoui Sananikone government of Laos further demanded the dissolution of the commission. Following the recent flagrant violation of the Geneva Accords by the Royal Lao Government, which brazenly launched an armed offensive against the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, thereby provoking a civil war, countries participating in the Geneva Conference, such as the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, have successively called for the immediate resumption of the commission's activities.

    尼赫鲁要求
    重开老挝国际委员会会议
    新华社新德里2日电　印度新闻处1日报道：据日内瓦传来的通讯社消息说，尼赫鲁总理在老挝发生了一些事件以后，已经要求重新召开老挝国际监察和监督委员会的会议。
    报道说：尼赫鲁总理是在写给英国外交大臣劳埃德和苏联外交部长葛罗米柯的信中提出这个要求的。尼赫鲁的信件由印度驻日内瓦总领事在5月31日交给了在日内瓦的劳埃德和葛罗米柯。
    老挝国际监察和监督委员会是根据1954年签订的关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议成立的。委员会的成员国包括印度、加拿大和波兰、主席由印度代表担任。委员会的任务是负责监察和监督日内瓦协议在老挝的实施。在1958年7月，由于加拿大代表的坚持，这个委员会通过了无限期休会的决定。老挝培·萨纳尼空政府随后又进而要求解散这个委员会。在老挝王国政府最近进一步违反日内瓦协议悍然对前寮国战斗部队发动武装进攻从而挑起内战以后，参加日内瓦会议的苏联、中国和越南民主共和国等国家都先后要求立即恢复这个委员会的活动。
