	Hygiene is Even More Important in Summer
	Fu Lianzhang

	Over 90% of China is located in the temperate zone, with four distinct seasons and flourishing life. Summer is the time when fruit trees bear fruit and seedlings grow strong. It can be said to be a beneficial season for people.

	Some say that summer is prone to diseases. Yes, good things can also bring some bad factors. However, people can always conquer nature and are not conquered by nature. As long as we prepare in advance and prevent early, we can spend the summer healthy and happily.

	There are three reasons why diseases are prone to occur in summer: First, summer heat easily causes heatstroke. Second, hot weather makes it easy to eat cold food, and the summer temperature is conducive to bacterial growth, so food is prone to spoilage, which creates the possibility of suffering from dysentery and other gastroenteritis. Third, mosquitoes and flies breed in summer and become vectors for spreading diseases.

	Eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene are the most important means of preventing diseases. Take dysentery as an example. According to statistics from individual districts in Beijing, the incidence of dysentery in 1958 decreased by 60% compared with 1957, and from January to May this year, it decreased by about 20% compared with the same period in 1958. This is the effect of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene to prevent diseases. Flies are the medium for spreading dysentery and other intestinal infectious diseases. In addition, intestinal infectious diseases can also bring bacteria from one's own hands and unclean food or tableware. The contact surface of human hands is the widest. For example, shaking hands with friends, counting banknotes, and pushing the toilet door can all cause you to get some bacteria. Bacteria are so small that sometimes millions of bacteria gather on your hands, and you even think your hands are very clean and dust-free. If you take a steamed bun or bread with hands contaminated with bacteria and put it into your mouth, you effectively help the bacteria enter your digestive tract.

	Mosquitoes can spread diseases such as malaria and encephalitis. In recent years, the incidence of these diseases has also greatly decreased. For example, nearly 40% of the malaria-prone areas in the country have basically eliminated malaria. This once again illustrates the great achievements of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene. Don't think that we are working hard when we clean up, in fact, everyone has unknowingly benefited a lot from the hygiene movement, so this movement must be carried out in depth to completely eliminate the four pests, and we and our descendants will benefit even more.

	Heatstroke is another harm brought to us by the summer heat. How does it happen? We know that the human body is thermostatic. People consume heat energy in life and work, so people have to eat food, continuously oxidize in the body, and continuously generate and supply heat energy. However, in order to maintain a constant body temperature of about 37 degrees Celsius, the human body must dissipate excess heat. The human body mainly dissipates excess heat in four ways: conduction, radiation, convection, and sweat evaporation. Of course, breathing and defecation can also dissipate a certain amount of heat. Conduction, radiation, and convection all have a prerequisite, that is, the surrounding temperature must be lower than the body temperature. If the temperature is very close to the body temperature or even higher, it will be very difficult. The remaining heat dissipation depends only on sweating and evaporation. Sweat turns into water vapor, which can take away part of the heat. However, if the humidity of the air is high and the water vapor is close to saturation, evaporation will not be easy. In addition, after a lot of sweating, people lose a lot of water. Water is the most needed thing physiologically. Sweat also contains salt. Excessive sweating will cause excessive salt loss, and salt is an indispensable factor for maintaining the normal tension of water, acid-base balance, and muscle tension in the body. Too much salt loss can cause muscle cramps. In high-temperature conditions, or in an environment exposed to direct sunlight, working for a long time, especially heavy physical labor, can cause impaired thermoregulation, difficulty in dissipating excess heat, or excessive dehydration and salt loss due to the influence of high heat, which may cause dizziness, headache, blurred vision, weakness of the limbs, or even fainting, which is called heatstroke. Heatstroke can also be prevented. For example, if you work in a high-temperature environment, you should have ventilation and cooling facilities, and prepare some cool or salty drinks. When you start to feel dizzy and uncomfortable, quickly go to a cool and ventilated place to rest, drink some cool drinks, and take some heat-relieving drugs.

	"Prepare beforehand, and you will succeed." If we understand these principles, pay attention to them, and take appropriate measures, we can effectively prevent diseases and live a healthy and happy life in summer.

### 夏天更要讲卫生

    夏天更要讲卫生
    傅连暲
    我国90％以上的地区处在温带，四时分明，万物兴旺，而夏天正是果树成实，禾苗茁壮的时候。可以说是一个有益于人的季节。
    有人说：夏季要多发些疾病。是的，好事里也可能带来些坏的因素。但是人总可以征服自然，并不是为自然所征服，只要未雨绸缪及早预防就使我们能健康而愉快的度过夏天。
    夏天容易发病有三条原因：第一、因为夏季酷热容易发生中暑。第二、天热容易吃生冷的东西，而夏天的气温又有利于细菌生长，食物易于腐败，这就造成了患痢疾和其它肠胃炎的可能性。第三、蚊蝇在夏季孳生，成为传播疾病的媒介。
    除四害讲卫生是预防疾病最重要的手段，就拿痢疾来说吧，据北京市个别地区的统计，1958年较1957年痢疾发病率下降了60％，今年1至5月份又比1958年同期下降了20％左右，这就是除四害讲卫生预防疾病的效果。苍蝇就是传播痢疾和其它肠道传染病的媒介，此外肠道传染病还可以从自己的手和不洁的饮食物或食具带来细菌。人手的接触面最广，如像用手同朋友们握手，用手去数钞票，用手推厕所的门等等都可能使你沾上一点细菌，细菌又是那样的小，有时千百万的细菌在你的手上集居起来，甚至你还觉得你的手是十分洁净无尘的。沾上细菌的手，去拿窝头馒头送进口里，就有效地帮助了细菌进入你的消化道。
    蚊子可以传播疟疾、脑炎等疾病。近年来这些病的发病率也大大的下降了，例如全国近40％左右的疟疾流行地区已经基本上消灭了疟疾。这又一次说明了除四害讲卫生的巨大成果。不要看我们打扫卫生时辛苦，其实我们每个人已经不知不觉地受到了卫生运动的很大益处，所以这个运动还要深入的展开，彻底的消灭四害，我们和我们的后代，将会受到更大的益处。
    发生中暑是暑热给我们带来的又一种坏处。它是怎样发生的呢？我们知道人体是恒温的，人在生活和劳动中都要消耗热能，所以人要吃进食物，在身体内不断氧化不断产生和供应热能，但是人体要维持摄氏三十七度左右的恒定的体温，就必须把多余的热量放散出去。人体放散余热主要有四种方式，即传导、辐射、对流、汗水蒸发，当然还有呼吸和大小便等也可以放散一定的热。传导、辐射、对流都有一个先决条件，就是周围的气温比体温要低一些，如果气温与体温很接近甚至还要高些，这就很困难了，剩下的就只有依赖于出汗蒸发，汗水变成水汽可以带走一部分热量，但如空气的湿度大，水汽已近饱和时，蒸发也就不容易。还有人在大量出汗以后，损失很多水分，水是生理上最需要的东西，汗中还带有盐分，大量出汗会使盐耗损过多，而盐是维持身体内水分的正常张力、酸碱平衡以及肌肉的紧张度等不可缺少的因素，失盐太多，可以引起肌肉抽筋。在高温的条件下，或者在烈日直射的环境下，长时间工作，特别是重的体力劳动，由于高热的影响使体温调节发生障碍、余热放散困难或脱水失盐太多，就有可能发生头昏、头痛、眼花、四肢无力甚至昏倒，这就叫做中暑。中暑同样是可以预防的，如像高温环境下工作，就要有通风防暑降温的设施，准备一些清凉或者带盐的饮料。在开始出现头昏不适的感觉时很快到荫凉通风的地方去休息一下，喝些清凉的饮料以及服用一些解暑的药物。
    “凡事豫则立”，懂得了这些道理加以重视，采取适当的措施，就能有效的防止疾病，使我们在夏天生活得健康而愉快。
