    Promote the Practice of Diligence and Frugality in Managing Households

    Diligence and frugality in managing households is an excellent tradition of the Chinese people. Vigorously promoting the practice of diligence and frugality in managing households aligns with both individual and national interests. As the ancients said, "Always think of days without when you have them, and don't wait until you have nothing to think of having something." This means we should be diligent and frugal in managing households. Li Yuying deeply understands the benefits of diligence and frugality in managing households. She usually pays attention to saving, so when unexpected events occur, she can deal with them calmly. The spirit of diligence and frugality in managing households has also cultivated her diligence, strength, optimism, and neat habits, which is why her family life is very good. The above illustrates the benefits of diligence and frugality in managing households for individuals. For the country, socialist construction requires a large amount of construction funds. In 1958, China achieved a great leap forward in production. However, changing China's original state of poverty cannot be accomplished in a very short time. In order to further develop production, the country needs more funds, which requires people across the country to be diligent and thrifty, saving every penny that can be saved and depositing it in the National Bank. If everyone does this, it will be a great force.

    Diligence and frugality in managing households benefits both individuals and the country, so why can't some people do it? One reason is that some people have an unclear understanding of the relationship between production and consumption, and unilaterally demand excessively high levels of consumption. Production is the basis of consumption, and consumption can only gradually increase with the development of production. Consumption is not waste, and we should be thrifty at all times. When materials are not yet abundant, we must both increase production and save even more. Consuming less now is precisely for consuming more in the future. Another reason is that some people have an unclear understanding of the relationship between the whole and the individual, only considering their own immediate interests, and disregarding the overall and long-term interests. In China's socialist family, the interests of the country and the interests of the individual are completely consistent. Individual thrift benefits the country, and the ultimate goal of national development is still to improve the people's lives. We should fully recognize this principle, take the overall situation into consideration, be mindful of the big picture, and not only start from individual interests, overcome waste, vigorously promote the practice of diligence and frugality, and contribute to socialist construction.

### 大兴勤俭持家之风

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    大兴勤俭持家之风
    勤俭持家，是我国人民的优良传统。大兴勤俭持家之风，符合个人利益，也符合国家利益。古人说过“常将有日思无日，莫待无时想有时”的话，就是说要勤俭持家。李玉英深切体会到勤俭持家的好处，平日注意积蓄，遇到一些意外事情，就可以从容地解决。勤俭持家的精神，也培养了她勤快、坚强、乐观的精神和整洁的习惯，因而她的家庭生活很好。上面这些是说勤俭持家对个人有好处。对国家来说，进行社会主义建设，需要大量的建设资金。1958年，我国实现了生产大跃进。但是，要改变我国原来的贫困面貌，并不是很短时间就能办到的。为了进一步发展生产，国家需要更多的资金，这就需要全国人民克勤克俭，把能不花的钱节省下来，储蓄到国家银行里，人人这样做，就是很大的力量。
    勤俭持家对个人对国家都有好处，为什么有些人不能这样做呢？原因之一，是有些人对生产和消费的关系认识不清，片面地过高地要求消费。生产是消费的基础，只能随着生产的发展，逐渐地增加消费。消费并不是浪费，任何时候我们都应当节约。在目前物资还不充裕的时候，我们一方面要增加生产，一方面更要节约。现在少消费一些，正是为将来多消费。另一个原因，是有些人对整体和个人的关系认识不清，只顾个人眼前的利益，不顾整体和长远利益。在我国的社会主义大家庭中，国家利益和个人利益是完全一致的，个人注意节约，对国家有好处，国家发展生产，最终的目的仍然是为了改善人民的生活。我们应该充分认清这个道理，顾大局，识大体，而不只从个人的利益出发，克服浪费，大兴勤俭之风，为社会主义建设出力。（“河北日报”社论摘要）
