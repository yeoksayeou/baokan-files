"Three-Combination" and Wheat Close Planting
By our reporter Wen Ying

Many visitors have been drawn to the First Management District of Linzhang Town People's Commune in Ci County, Hebei Province, this year due to its large-scale bumper wheat harvest. Among them are farmers who come to learn from the experience, cadres who come to help summarize the experience, photographers and news reporters.

How was the large-scale bumper harvest achieved? The unanimous answer is: earnest implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. In fact, from planting to harvesting, the issues involved are not as simple as the answer suggests.

Differing Opinions, Unresolved Disputes

When discussing measures to increase wheat production this year in this management district, everyone had no different opinions on deep plowing, fertilization, watering, pest control, and management. However, there were many different opinions on close planting; some said denser was better, and others said sparser was better. In order to find a suitable density to ensure increased production, the management district convened a "three-combination" meeting, including more than 30 people, including production team leaders, native and foreign agricultural experts, experienced old farmers, and young and middle-aged activists, to specifically discuss the issue of wheat seeding rate. At the meeting, the youth, represented by the young professional team leader Chang Zhi, advocated for the denser the better, proposing a seeding rate of 60 jin per mu. This opinion was immediately opposed by Ding Wenyuan, the captain of the First Production Team and a well-known expert in farming. Based on his team's experience of a wheat yield of 300 jin per mu in the previous year (1958), which was nearly double the yield of 1957, he argued that the seeding rate this year should not exceed 20 jin at most. At the time, this opinion was supported by some elderly farmer representatives. Sun Sibao, the captain of the Sixth Production Team and a well-known native agricultural expert in the entire management district, said: "In 1958, the wheat seeding rate of several production teams in our village was around 22 jin, an increase of five or six jin compared to 1957. Coupled with improved management techniques, the average yield per mu increased by 57%. Some production teams, because the seeding rate reached 25 jin, had 40 mu of wheat with an average yield of 650 jin per mu. This year, the commune members are even more enthusiastic, all the land has been deeply plowed, fertilizers are sufficient, and water conservancy conditions are also better than in the past. There is also more experience in wheat high-yield cultivation. Therefore, it is still possible to increase the seeding rate a little compared to last year." However, he did not agree with seeding 60 jin per mu, advocating for a seeding rate of around 30 jin per mu, and no more than 35 jin at most. His proposal was finally agreed upon by the majority of people. However, the old farmer captain Ding Wenyuan and the young people who advocated for the denser the better each retained their own opinions.

A Determination to Compete

Wheat sowing began, and 35 of the 37 production teams in the First Management District referred to the opinions discussed at the management district's "three-combination" meeting and arranged different seeding rates for different plots of land.

The elderly captain Ding Wenyuan, in order to implement his own ideas, did not find a single young person to participate during sowing. He and the elderly commune members secretly used a single-spout seed drill to sow more than 10 mu of wheat fields by the village, at a rate of 18 jin per mu; the remaining 40 mu of wheat fields were sown at a rate of 30 jin per mu. Ding Wenyuan firmly believed that the more than 10 mu of land sown according to his plan would definitely outperform those wheat fields sown at 30 jin.

The young people of the youth professional team, after their opinion of the denser the better was criticized, were not convinced, and they were determined to create a close planting model for everyone to see. Their team's wheat field was 120 mu, and they used 12 mu as a close planting high-yield experimental field, seeding more than 60 jin per mu. They said, let's do it, if we grow it well, we'll have experience, if we grow it badly, we'll have a lesson.

Problems Arise

Due to timely sowing, sufficient base fertilizer, and adequate moisture, all of the 2,900 mu of wheat seedlings in the entire management district, except for a few that were sown later due to being vacated from cotton and sweet potato fields, with relatively yellow and weak seedlings, the rest were lush and green and particularly gratifying. During the seedling stage, Ding Wenyuan's more than 10 mu of sparsely planted wheat, because of the narrow sowing width and concentrated seeds, grew better than the wide-row closely planted ones, with the wheat rows looking like thick eyebrows. The 12 mu of close planting "model" fields of the youth team, because of deep plowing and sufficient base fertilizer, the soil was not visible as soon as the wheat seedlings emerged.

After the jointing stage, the differences between the sparsely planted, over-densely planted, and reasonably densely planted wheat became increasingly obvious: the large area of reasonably densely planted wheat had more tillers, thick and strong stalks, and wide, oily green wheat leaves; the sparsely planted wheat sown with drills appeared somewhat yellow and thin due to the narrow sowing width and crowded seeds; the youth team's densely planted "model" began to lodge and experience root rot due to poor ventilation and light penetration. Although they took various rescue measures, the reasonably densely planted wheat had already taken the lead.

Facts Draw the Conclusion

In order to find a reasonable density from this year's wheat planting experience, the leading cadres and technical personnel of this management district conducted comparisons and studies on Ding Wenyuan Production Team's 18 jin per mu sown with drills, the youth team's 60 jin per mu broadcast sowing, and the large area of wheat fields sown with about 30 jin per mu before wheat harvest. The situation was: 18 jin of seeds per mu resulted in about 270,000 plants per mu, with an average of 18 grains per ear; the 60 jin per mu wheat field, after opening the rows and removing plants, still had more than 530,000 plants per mu, with an average of 12 grains per ear; the large area of wheat fields sown with about 30 jin per mu had about 320,000 plants per mu, with an average of 30 grains per ear. This shows that appropriate close planting significantly increased production, while lower densities and over-densities did not yield as high as appropriate close planting.

The Linzhang Town First Management District's wheat had a large-scale bumper harvest; this is the success of appropriate close planting, and also the victory of the "three-combination" – the mass line.

    “三结合”和小麦密植
    本报记者  文英
    河北磁县临漳镇人民公社第一管理区，因为今年小麦大面积丰收招来了许多参观的客人。其中有来学经验的农民，有来帮助总结经验的干部，有摄影师和新闻记者。
    大面积丰产怎样得来的？人们同声的回答是：认真执行了“八字宪法”。其实，从种到收，其中的问题并不像回答得那么简单。
    各有主张，争执不下
    今年这个管理区在讨论小麦增产措施的时候，大家对深翻、施肥、浇水、除虫、管理等没有什么不同的意见。可是对密植意见却很多，有的说密些好，有的说稀些好。为了找到一个保证增产的适当密度，管理区召开了一个包括生产队长、土洋农业专家、有经验的老农和青、壮年积极分子三十多人参加的“三结合”会议，专门讨论了小麦下种量的问题。会上，以青年专业队长常志为代表的青年们，主张越密越好，提出每亩下种六十斤。这个意见立刻遭到了第一生产队队长、有名的种地能手丁文远的反对。他根据当年（1958年）本队小麦亩产三百斤，比1957年增产近一倍的经验，主张今年下种量最多不能超过二十斤。当时，这个意见得到了一部分老年农民代表的支持。第六生产队的队长、全管区有名的农业土专家孙思保说：“1958年俺们村的几个生产队的小麦播种量是二十二斤上下，比1957年增加了五、六斤，加上改进了管理技术，平均每亩增产57％。有的生产小队因为播种量达到了二十五斤，有四十亩小麦平均亩产达到了六百五十斤。今年社员们干劲更大了，地全部深翻了，肥料充足，水利条件也比过去好，小麦的丰产经验也多了。因此下种量比去年多一些还是可以的。”但是他不赞成每亩下种六十斤，主张每亩下种三十斤上下，最多不过三十五斤。他的主张，最后得到大多数人的同意。但是老农队长丁文远和主张越密越好的青年们，各自保留了自己的意见。
    决心比一比
    小麦播种开始了，第一管理区的三十七个生产队有三十五个队参照管理区“三结合”会议商量的意见，安排了不同地块的播种量。
    老年队长丁文远，为了实行自己的主张，下种的时候，没有找一个青年人参加。他和老年社员们一起，偷偷地用独眼耧在村边的十多亩麦地里，按每亩十八斤下了种；其余的四十多亩麦地，按每亩三十斤下了种。丁文远深信，按他的主张种的十多亩地，一定会高出那些下种三十斤的麦田。
    青年专业队青年们的越密越好的意见受到批评后，并不服气，他们决心要搞出个密植样板给大家看看。他们队的麦地是一百二十亩，用十二亩作密植高产试验田，每亩下种六十斤以上。他们说，干吧，种好了有经验，种坏了有教训。
    问题出来了
    由于播种适时，底肥多、水分足，全管理区的二千九百多亩麦苗，除少数因棉、薯地腾出来的晚，播种较迟，苗子比较黄弱外，其余都绿油油的格外喜人。幼苗期，丁文远的十多亩耧播稀植麦，因为播幅窄、籽种集中，长得比宽幅密植的好看，麦垅活像一道道浓眉。青年队的十二亩密植高产试验田，因为深翻、底肥足，麦苗一出土就看不见地皮了。
    拔节以后，稀植的、过密的、合理密植的三种麦，差异日益明显了：大面积合理密植麦，稞多、秸秆粗壮、麦叶宽大油绿；耧播稀植的因播幅窄、籽粒挤，显得有些黄瘦；青年队的密植“样板”，因为通风、透光困难，开始倒伏，发生烂根现象。尽管他们采取各种抢救措施，但是合理密植的小麦已经领先了。
    事实作了结论
    为了从今年种植小麦的经验中，找到一个合理密度，小麦收获前，这个管理区的领导干部和技术人员，对丁文远生产队耧耩每亩下种十八斤、青年队每亩撒播籽种六十斤和每亩播种三十斤左右的大面积麦田，作了对比、研究。情况是：下种十八斤的每亩二十七万株左右，每穗平均十八粒；下种六十斤的麦田，经过开垅去棵，每亩还有五十三万来株，每穗平均十二粒；下种三十斤上下的大面积麦田，每亩约有三十二万株，每穗平均三十粒。这说明适当密植的显著增产，而较稀、过密的产量都不如适当密植的高。
    临漳镇第一管理区的小麦大面积丰产了，这是适当密植的成功，也是“三结合”——群众路线的胜利。
