Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, June 26th: The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Xiamen and representatives from all sectors of Xiamen city gathered on the 25th to welcome He Yechen, a Chiang Kai-shek army sergeant and squad leader, who swam back to the mainland from Greater Kinmen Island on the 11th and surrendered to our army.

Colonel Li Zhiqiang, a representative of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and Xu Zuyi, Deputy Mayor of Xiamen, spoke at the meeting. They welcomed He Yechen's patriotic act of risking his life to abandon the darkness and turn to the bright, returning to the motherland.

He Yechen said at the meeting that in Taiwan and Kinmen, he deeply felt that betraying the motherland meant a bleak future, and he spent every day in pain. He was deeply grateful for the lenient treatment he received from the People's Liberation Army and said that he would definitely study hard and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland in the future to repay the care of the motherland and the people.

When He Yechen returned, he carried a pistol with him. A certain unit of the Fujian Frontline troops, in accordance with the Ministry of National Defense's order regarding rewards for Chiang Kai-shek army personnel who defect with weapons, awarded He Yechen a bonus.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, June 26th: He Yechen, a Chiang Kai-shek army sergeant who recently crossed the sea from Kinmen to return, told our reporter about the homesickness and war-weariness of mainland-born soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek army.

This sergeant and squad leader from the 1st Company, 1st Battalion, 79th Regiment of the original Chiang Kai-shek 27th Division, fled to Taiwan with the defeated Chiang Kai-shek army in November 1949. He was stationed in Taichung for more than seven years and was transferred to Kinmen in November of the year before last. He Yechen said that when talking about why he risked his life to escape from the Chiang Kai-shek army, he said that Americans ran rampant in Taiwan, and anyone with a little Chinese integrity could not stand it, and it was even less worthwhile to fight and sell his life for them. Therefore, he made up his mind that even if there was a danger of being buried in the belly of a fish, he would break through the raging sea and waves to throw himself into the arms of the motherland.

When talking about the homesickness and war-weariness of the Chiang Kai-shek army soldiers, He Yechen said that now the mainland-born soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek army are all filled with grief when they mention their hometowns, because these people have been away from home for more than ten years and have not seen their parents, wives, or children even once. Due to the strict secret service rule in the Chiang Kai-shek army, everyone is afraid to write letters to their families, and letters from their families are also withheld by the secret service, and they cannot be seen by the individuals. These people were mostly strong young men when they fled to Taiwan with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, but now, the younger ones are in their early thirties and the older ones are over forty, and their bodies are gradually weakening. Some have become "retired soldiers," but they are lonely and helpless, homeless, and have to live a miserable life of wandering around.

The Kuomintang authorities use brothels – "military recreation centers" - and the promise that officers and old soldiers from the mainland can marry, etc., as deceptive tricks to "stabilize" the morale of the army. However, the soldiers' homesickness and war-weariness are becoming more and more serious. He Yechen said that he is a sergeant who has been a soldier for more than ten years, and his monthly salary is 127 Taiwan dollars. Rice in Kinmen costs more than three dollars per catty. If this money is used to buy rice for a woman, there will be no money to buy oil, salt, soy sauce, or vinegar, let alone raise children. Some old soldiers got married, but not only were they unable to relieve their homesickness, but they also added a heavy burden. Some were transferred to Kinmen, and their wives were still destitute in Taiwan, living by begging, and some were forced to remarry or become prostitutes.

    福建前线军民集会
    欢迎投诚蒋军士兵
    投诚的贺业臣谈述蒋军士兵思乡厌战情绪
    新华社福建前线26日电　中国人民解放军驻厦门部队同厦门市各界人民代表25日集会，欢迎11日从大金门岛泅水回到大陆，向我军投诚的蒋军中士班长贺业臣。
    人民解放军某部代表李志强上校和厦门市副市长许祖义先后在会上讲了话。他们对贺业臣冒着生命危险，弃暗投明，归向祖国的爱国行为表示欢迎。
    贺业臣在会上说，他在台湾和金门，深深感到背叛祖国，前途渺茫，每天都是在痛苦中度过。他对解放军给他的宽大待遇深为感激，表示今后一定努力学习，积极参加祖国社会主义建设，来报答祖国和人民的关怀。
    贺业臣归来时，携带手枪一支，福建前线部队某部遵照国防部关于蒋军人员携械投诚给奖的命令，授给了贺业臣奖金。
    据新华社福建前线26日电　最近从金门渡海归来的蒋军中士班长贺业臣，向本社记者叙述了蒋军中大陆籍的士兵思乡厌战的情形。
    这位原蒋军二十七师七十九团一营一连的中士班长是1949年11月随溃散的蒋军逃到台湾的，他在台中驻了七年多，前年11月被调到金门。贺业臣谈到他为什么冒生命的危险逃离蒋军时说，美国人在台湾横行霸道，稍有一点中国人气节的人都无法忍受，为他打仗卖命更不值得，因此他才下定决心，那怕有葬身鱼腹的危险，也要冲破怒海狂浪投到祖国的怀抱来。
    贺业臣在谈到蒋军士兵思乡厌战的情况时说，现在蒋军中的大陆籍士兵，一提起家乡无不悲痛万分，因为这些人离开家都十多年了，没有见过一次爹娘、妻子、儿女。由于蒋军中严密的特务统治，每个人都不敢给家人写信，家人写来的信也都被特务扣去，本人是见不到的。这些人在跟随蒋介石集团逃往台湾的时候，多半是身强力壮的青年，而现在，小的三十出头，大的已四十以外，身体日渐衰弱。有的虽然成了“退伍军人”，但是孤独无依，无家可归，只好过着四处流浪的悲惨生活。
    国民党当局用妓女院——“军中乐园”，士官、大陆去的老兵可以结婚等骗术，来“安定”军心。可是士兵们的思乡厌战情绪越来越重。贺业臣说，他是一个当了十多年兵的中士班长，每月薪饷台币一百二十七元，金门的大米三元多一斤，这些钱给一个女人买了米，就没有钱买油盐酱醋，更没法养儿育女。个别老兵结了婚，不但没有能够解除思家之痛，反增加了一个沉重的包袱，有的调到金门以后，女的还在台湾生活无着，靠乞讨度日，有的被迫改嫁或沦为娼妓。
