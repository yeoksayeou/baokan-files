    From the Two-Headed Dog

    ——Visiting Soviet Physiological Experimenter Demikhov
    By Our Correspondent Dai Feng

    At the end of March, the Tissue Transplantation Laboratory of the First Medical Institute of Moscow conducted a successful experiment of transplanting an animal head. The medical workers of this laboratory, under the leadership of the famous physiological experimenter Demikhov, transplanted the head of a four-month-old small white dog onto the neck of a four-year-old, dark grey-brown wolfdog named "Pirate." After the operation, this strange two-headed animal lived normally for twenty-nine days. The success of this animal head transplantation experiment provided new and valuable experience and demonstration for the new department of medical science—animal tissue and organ transplantation, and it is also of great significance for further research on improving people's health.
          Head Transplantation
    Recently, I interviewed Demikhov at the First Medical Institute of Moscow. He is now the director of the Tissue Transplantation Laboratory and has just turned forty-three this year.
    Our conversation started with the dog head transplantation surgery. Demikhov first talked about the general situation of tissue transplantation. Animal tissue transplantation, especially animal heart and head transplantation experiments, is still a relatively young scientific research department. In 1954, Demikhov began to engage in the research of animal head transplantation. In these years, he has conducted more than twenty dog head transplantation experiments. After surgery, the two-headed dogs generally lived for only two or three days to six or seven days, and then died due to different vascular occlusions. The result of this dog head transplantation was different from previous times. The two-headed "Pirate" lived normally for twenty-nine days. This relatively long period of life allowed scholars to study the survival of transplanted animal tissues more comprehensively.
    Animal head transplantation surgery is very complicated. Demikhov went on to talk about the process of this dog head transplantation: full preparations were made before this experimental surgery. The procedure of the surgery was: first, cut open the neck of the big dog to find the carotid artery and jugular vein that connect to the heart and lungs. Then, the four-month-old puppy was cut off at the waist while maintaining normal blood circulation. In order to connect fewer blood vessels, the puppy's front legs were preserved. When the heart arteries and veins of the big and small dogs were connected, and the big dog's blood flowed normally into the small dog's head, the small dog's heart was removed and the skin was sutured. The entire surgery took four hours. After the surgery, the heads of the big and small dogs regained consciousness at different times.
    During the twenty-nine days, this two-headed "Pirate" lived normally under the close attention of medical staff. The big dog ate two rabbits a day as usual and could walk and run. The small dog was originally quite fierce. After being transplanted on the big dog's neck, it still opened its mouth to bite when people's fingers "invaded" it, but at this time, the big dog seemed indifferent and did not respond. Because the esophagus was not connected, the small dog's head did not eat anything. Although the heads of the big and small dogs shared the same heart, lungs, and blood, they had their own sweat glands, endocrine glands, appetite glands, and different brain nerve reactivity. All this proves that the transplanted dog head maintains an independent nervous system and does not interfere with each other. Twenty-nine days later, because the big dog's head moved too much, causing a slight detachment at the surgical suture, the small dog's head lymph glands were blocked, resulting in swelling. In order to further study the experimental surgery, this two-headed "Pirate" was artificially euthanized.
    So, what kind of scientifically valuable conclusions can be drawn from this successful transplantation? Demikhov then answered this question. He said: The purpose of transplanting animal tissues and organs is to truly solve the problem of whether different kinds of animal tissues and organs can coexist after transplantation from many aspects. Earlier, many scientists believed that tissues from different bodies could not coexist, so they also believed that animal tissues could not be transplanted. In this experiment, the big and small dogs used by Demikhov were of different breeds, different ages, and different coat colors. After transplantation, the small dog's white soft fur grew one centimeter longer, and a second row of teeth grew completely. The skin was smooth and moist, and the skin and flesh at the suture site grew together well. These phenomena clearly prove that animal tissues from different bodies can coexist. Therefore, the opposite conclusions of earlier scientists can be discussed. This is precisely the principled argument that Demikhov made in this experiment. Secondly, this head transplantation provides another new conclusion for medical science: that is, the previous view of scientists that the immune response of transplanted animal tissues is inevitable is also overestimated. After the surgery, no epidemic reactions were found in the observation of the "Pirate"'s heart, lungs, muscles, and endocrine glands. At the same time, observations of the "Pirate"'s heart proved that the heart of one animal can completely bear the blood circulation required for the normal activities of two animal bodies and supply the oxygen required for the body's consumption. Moreover, this experiment conducted beneficial observations on the neural activity of the transplanted head. As for the experience of this surgery, Demikhov concluded: In future experiments, we believe that we can make the dog with the transplanted head live for a long time.
          Heart Transplantation
    Demikhov has also conducted insightful research on animal heart transplantation.
    The heart is like a big door. Once it is closed, all other doors, big and small, in the room will be blocked. According to scientific measurements: the human heart absorbs and transports five liters of blood per minute, and seven thousand two hundred liters per day. Therefore, abnormal heart activity is often the cause of a series of serious diseases.
    For a long time, Soviet medical scientists have made great contributions in treating heart disease and performing heart surgery. The Moscow Institute of Heart Surgery alone has cured thousands of heart disease patients with "incurable diseases." However, if heart disease patients are ineffective in medicine and surgery, can transplantation treatment be performed?
    Demikhov is studying heart surgery in many ways: heart resuscitation, heart surgery, and animal heart transplantation.
    Previously, many medical scientists have also conducted research on animal heart transplantation, but they all failed because they did not find the correct method of transplantation surgery. For example, to transplant a heart, one must first be able to make two hearts function normally together. So, where should the second heart be placed? Many scholars believe that the internal organs near the heart are too crowded, so they often put the transplanted second heart not under the neck in the body, but under the abdomen. Because the transplanted heart is too far away from the original heart, it cannot participate in the entire blood circulation, so it is equal to no transplantation effect.
    In 1940, Demikhov graduated from the Department of Biology of Moscow University. After entering the medical field, he began research on heart surgery. For nearly twenty years, Demikhov has conducted hundreds of animal heart transplantation experiments. In the first twenty-five experiments, all the dogs with transplanted hearts died on the operating table. The young experimenter was not discouraged. He gained experience from the failures and re-experimented. Finally, he found the most successful surgical method among more than twenty surgical plans. The main content of this transplantation surgery is: first connect the transplanted heart to the blood vessels of the original heart so that it can function normally together. The transplanted second heart must be close to the original heart, so the lower lobe of the lung must be cut off by one-seventh in order to put in the second heart. As few blood vessels as possible should be connected when the transplanted heart is connected to the blood vessels of the original heart (two to five), and the function of the two hearts must remain normal after transplantation. Demikhov finally created this unique animal heart transplantation surgery in the world. In recent years, more than twenty double-heart dog transplantations he has performed have been very effective, and dogs with two hearts have lived normally for more than two months.
    How do the two hearts function after animal heart transplantation? Demikhov told reporters: The transplanted heart starts to function immediately after being connected to the blood vessels of the original heart. The opening and closing of the two hearts are not consistent, but they each bear half of the blood transfusion task of the entire blood circulation. And when the original heart is forced to stop beating, the transplanted second heart immediately assumes the function of the entire blood circulation. After experimenting with animal two-heart transplantation, Demikhov also experimented with removing the original heart and lungs of a dog, and as a result, the dog that had the heart and lungs of another dog lived normally for six days.
    Why can't dogs with transplanted hearts live for a long time? Demikhov said: There are more reasons for this. Early deaths are mostly due to imperfect surgery. Now we have analyzed the causes of death in detail. The facts show that death can be avoided, and the transplanted heart can live to the period it should live.
    Demikhov has also conducted in-depth research on the treatment of myocardial infarction, which is generally ineffective with medication. Myocardial infarction is caused by blood clots in the coronary artery two or three centimeters above the heart, blocking blood circulation. Demikhov used a transplanted new blood vessel connected to the lower end of the coronary artery, so that blood flowed into the heart through the new blood vessel. This transplantation surgery only takes one minute to complete. Dogs that underwent this surgery three years ago are now living normally. This transplantation surgery method can also be applied to humans.
          Ultimate Goal
    What is the ultimate goal of this series of animal tissue transplantation experiments conducted by Demikhov and the laboratory he leads?
    According to scientific research, people should live to be two hundred years old, of which one hundred and sixty-five years can be engaged in labor. But why do people generally die when they are fifty or sixty years old? People's deaths are often caused by damage to a small part of internal organs, especially the heart, lungs, kidneys, nerve blood vessels, or tissues. Isn't it a pity that the whole human body is fine, but death is caused by a disease in one place? So, when the damage to this small part of the tissue or organ is ineffective to medicine, can the damaged "parts" of the human body be replaced like machines to extend human life?
    The ultimate goal of the transplantation research led by Demikhov's laboratory is to gradually solve this problem. Of course, this is not a simple problem. The long-term and painstaking research of Demikhov and many Soviet medical scientists: animal heart, lung, kidney transplantation, tissue or organ transplantation, and the recent animal head transplantation experiments are all creating conditions for solving this problem that benefits mankind. Because fundamentally, tissue transplantation is a reliable way to completely eliminate diseases. Demikhov said: "Now, from both theoretical and practical perspectives, this problem can be solved in the future. Of course, this requires further joint efforts from the medical community around the world."
    The laboratory led by Demikhov is also conducting animal rejuvenation experiments. They connect young animals to the kidneys, endocrine glands, or other blood vessels and other tissues of old animals, so that the young and vigorous body affects the old tissue body. Research in this area is being carried out seriously.
    The Soviet government attaches great importance to the creative work of Demikhov and other physiological experimenters. The leaders of the First Medical Institute strongly support Demikhov in conducting physiological experiments. Recently, in order to further expand the research on animal transplantation tissues, the Soviet government decided to allocate a large amount of funds and add twice the number of researchers to expand this transplantation tissue laboratory.

    从双头狗谈起
    ——访苏联生理学试验家杰米霍夫
    本报记者　戴枫
    3月底，莫斯科第一医学院移植组织试验室进行了一次成功的移植动物头部的试验。这个试验室的医务工作者，在著名的生理学试验家杰米霍夫领导下，把一只四个月的小白花狗头移植到了另外一只四岁的、名叫“海盗”的深灰褐色狼狗颈上。施行手术以后，这只双头奇怪动物一切正常地活了二十九天。这次动物头部移植试验的成功，对医学科学的新部门——动物组织和器官移植提供了新的宝贵经验和论证，同时对进一步研究增进人们的健康有很大意义。
          头部移植
    最近，记者在莫斯科第一医学院里访问了杰米霍夫。他现在是移植组织试验室主任，今年刚满四十三岁。
    我们的谈话是从狗头移植手术开始的。杰米霍夫首先谈到了组织移植的一般情况。动物组织移植，尤其是动物心脏、头部移植试验还是一门比较年轻的科学研究部门。1954年，杰米霍夫开始从事动物头部移植的研究。这些年里，他一共进行了二十多次狗头移植试验。施行手术以后，双头狗一般只活两三天到六、七天不等，以后都发生了不同的血管梗塞，引起死亡。这次狗头移植结果与以往历次都不同，双头“海盗”一切正常地活了二十九天。这样较长时间的生活期，使学者们能够较全面地研究被移植的动物组织生存的情况。
    动物头部移植手术非常复杂。杰米霍夫接着谈到这次狗头移植过程时说：这次试验手术之前作了充分的准备。手术的程序是：先给大狗颈上开刀，找出连结心肺的颈动脉和颈静脉。然后把四个月的小狗在保持血液正常循环的情况下齐腰割断。为了少接血管，小狗保存了前脚。到了把大小狗心脏动静脉血管接上，大狗的血液正常流入小狗头部的时候，才切除小狗的心脏，缝好皮肤。整个手术进行了四小时。施行手术以后，大小狗头在不同时间里恢复了知觉。
    二十九天中，这只双头“海盗”一直在医务人员的严密注意下正常地生活着。大狗一天照常吃两只兔子，能走能跑。小狗原先挺凶，移植在大狗颈上以后，当人们的手指“侵犯”它时，它仍然张嘴就咬，而这时，大狗却好像漠不关心似的毫无反应。由于没有接食道，因此小狗头不吃东西。大小狗睡眠时间是不一致的。大小狗头虽然是同心同肺同血液，但各有自己的汗腺、内分泌腺、食欲腺，脑神经反应性也各不相同。这一切都证明被移植的狗头保持着独立的神经系统，互不相扰。二十九天后，因为大狗头部活动过多，引起手术缝补处稍有脱落，小狗头部淋巴腺受阻塞，发生了肿胀现象。为了进一步对试验手术进行研究，才人工地处死了这只双头“海盗”。
    那末，从这次成功的移植中可以得出些什么样的有科学价值的论证呢？杰米霍夫接着回答了这个问题。他说：移植动物组织和器官的目的，是为了真正地从多方面来解决不同种的动物组织和器官移植后能否共同生存的问题。早先，有许多科学家认为不同体的组织是不能共同生存的，因此也就认为动物组织是不能移植的。在这次试验中，杰米霍夫使用的大小狗是不同种、不同年岁、不同毛色的。移植后，小狗头白色的软毛长长了一公分，又完整地长出了第二排牙齿，皮肤光滑柔润，缝接处的皮肉也很好地长在一起。这些现象明显地证明：不同体的动物组织是能够共同生存的。因此早先科学家们的相反结论是可以商榷的。这一点也正是杰米霍夫在这次试验中具有原则意义的论证。其次，这次头部移植对医学科学提供了另一个新的论断：即以前科学家们认为移植动物组织免疫性反应不可避免的观点，也是估计过高了。施行手术以后，在对“海盗”心脏、肺部、肌肉、内分泌腺等方面的观察中，没有发现疫症性反应。同时，在对“海盗”心脏观察中证明：一个动物的心脏完全可以负担起两个动物体正常活动中所需血液循环，供应机体消耗的氧气等需要。而且这次对移植头部的神经活动方面进行了有益的观察。至于这次手术的经验，杰米霍夫归结说：今后试验中我们相信能够使移植头部的狗长久地活下去。
          心脏移植
    杰米霍夫对动物心脏移植方面也作了精辟的研究。
    心脏好比一扇大门，它一关闭，室内其他大小门户也就遭致阻塞。根据科学测定：人类心脏每分钟吸收和输送的血液为五公升，一昼夜为七千二百公升。因此心脏活动不正常这往往是引起一系列严重病症的原因。
    长期以来，苏联医学家在医治心脏病和施行心脏手术等方面作出了巨大贡献。仅只莫斯科心脏手术研究所，就已给上千个“不治之症”的心脏病患者开刀治愈了。可是，如果心脏病患者在医药和手术都无效的情况下，能不能进行移植医疗呢？
    杰米霍夫正在多方面地研究心脏手术：心脏复活、心脏开刀和动物心脏移植。
    先前，许多医学家也进行过动物心脏移植的研究，但是都由于没有找到正确的移植手术的方法而失败了。譬如说，要移植心脏，先得能使两颗心脏正常地在一起活动。那末，第二颗心脏应该安放在哪里？许多学者认为心脏附近内脏过挤，所以他们往往把移植的第二颗心脏不是放在体内颈下，就是放在腹下，这样移植的心脏由于离原心脏过远，不能参加全部血液循环，因此等于没有起到移植作用。
    1940年，杰米霍夫毕业于莫斯科大学生物系，进入医学界以后，就开始了心脏手术的研究。将近二十年来，杰米霍夫进行过上百次的动物心脏移植的试验。在开初二十五次试验中，移植心脏的狗全部死在手术台上了。年青的试验家并没有灰心，他从失败中取得了经验，重新进行试验。最后，在二十多个手术方案中找出了最成功的手术方法。这个移植手术的主要内容是：首先将移植的心脏连接原心脏血管，使其正常地一起活动。移植的第二颗心脏一定要靠近原心脏，这样就要将肺部下叶切去七分之一，以便放进第二颗心脏。移植的心脏在接原心脏血管时尽量要少（两根到五根），而移植后两颗心脏的功能要保持正常。杰米霍夫最后创造了这种世界上独一无二的移植动物心脏手术。近年来，他所进行的二十多次双心狗移植，效果都很良好，两个心脏的狗有的一切正常地活了两个多月。
    动物心脏移植后，两颗心脏怎样活动的呢？杰米霍夫告诉记者：移植的心脏一接上原心脏血管后，立刻开始活动。两颗心脏启开、关闭是不一致的，但正好各半地负起全部血液循环的输血任务。而当原心脏被迫停止跳动时，移植的第二颗心脏就马上负起全部血液循环的功能。在试验了动物两个心脏移植后，杰米霍夫还试验过将一只狗的原心肺全部移掉，结果这只换上别的狗的心肺的狗正常地活了六天。
    为什么被移植心脏的狗不能长期地活下去呢？杰米霍夫说：这有较多的原因，早期引起死亡多半属于手术不完善。现在我们已详细地分析了死亡的原因，事实说明死亡可以避免，移植的心脏可以活到应活的时期。
    杰米霍夫还对一般服药医治无效的心脏梗塞症治疗方面作了深入的研究。心脏梗塞症是由于心脏上端冠状动脉两三公分处血块凝结，阻塞血液循环。杰米霍夫利用的移植一根新血管，连接在冠状脉下端，结果血液通过新血管流入心脏。这种移植手术只在一分钟内就结束。三年前，经过这种手术的狗，现在正常地活着。这种移植手术方法也可以应用到人体上。
          最终目的
    杰米霍夫和他所领导的试验室进行着这一系列动物组织移植试验的最终目的是什么呢？
    根据科学研究证明：人都应该活到二百岁，而其中有一百六十五年能够从事劳动。但为什么人一般活到五、六十岁时就死亡了呢？人的死亡往往多半是由于内脏器管，尤其是心、肺、肾、神经血管或组织的一小部分损坏而引起的。整个人体好好的，只因一处病症而引起死亡岂非可惜？那末，在对这一小部分组织或器管的损坏药医无效的时候，能不能像机器一样来更换一下人体内脏损坏的“零件”，使人延长寿命呢？
    杰米霍夫所领导的试验室移植研究的最终目的，就是为了逐步地解决这个问题。这当然不是一个简单的问题。杰米霍夫和许多苏联医学家长期来的精心研究：动物心脏、肺部、肾脏移植，组织或器管移植，以及近年来的动物头部移植的试验，都是在为解决这个造福人类的问题创造条件。因为从根本上看，移植组织是彻底铲除病症的一种可靠办法。杰米霍夫说：“现在不论从理论上或者是实践上看来，这个问题在将来是可以得到解决的。自然，这是需要全世界医学界进一步共同努力的。”
    杰米霍夫领导的试验室还进行着动物返老还童的试验，他们把年青动物连接在年老动物的肾脏、内分泌腺或其他血管等组织上，使年青的生活力强盛的机体影响年老的组织机体。这方面的研究正在认真进行中。
    苏联政府非常重视杰米霍夫等生理学试验工作者的创造性劳动。第一医学院领导上大力支持杰米霍夫进行生理试验。最近，为了进一步扩大动物移植组织的研究，苏联政府决定新拨出大量费用，增添一倍研究人员来扩充这个移植组织试验室。（附图片）
