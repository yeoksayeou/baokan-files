A cocktail party was held before the get-together began. Fang Ji, vice chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said at the cocktail party that "Baltic Sea Peace Week" has been held in Rostock, a famous port of peace in the German Democratic Republic, since the 27th. At this time, we gather together with our German friends, hoping that through our friends from Germany, we can convey the will of the people of Tianjin to defend world peace to the participants of "Baltic Sea Peace Week." He concluded by saying that as long as the people of all countries unite together, the imperialists' war conspiracy will surely be smashed.

Hermann, the representative of the Erfurt crew, then spoke. He said that the German people love peace and oppose war. Although the imperialists and West German militarists are creating a tense war situation in the Baltic Sea, the German people and peace-loving people all over the world will surely be able to stop the threat of war and promote the development of world peace.

After the cocktail party, the Tianjin Acrobatic Troupe performed acrobatic shows for the guests.
