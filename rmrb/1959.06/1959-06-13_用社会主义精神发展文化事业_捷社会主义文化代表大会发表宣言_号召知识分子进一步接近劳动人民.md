Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 11th: The Czechoslovak Socialist Cultural Congress solemnly concluded at noon today. The congress adopted a declaration and a letter to the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

    The declaration stated that Czechoslovak cultural workers believe their main social task is to develop cultural undertakings with a socialist spirit and to strive to promote the development of socialist culture.

    The declaration said that Czechoslovak cultural workers will conduct a comprehensive and resolute struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, against all forms of opportunism and revisionism, and against the hostile ideas of the old society.

    Referring to the demands of the workers and peasants for intellectuals to further approach them, the declaration pointed out that the Czechoslovak cultural circles will meet the people's needs for science, technology, and culture, and actively participate in revolutionary reforms to help the working people fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity in the cultural revolution.

    The declaration also proposed that cultural workers engage in solving urgent tasks on the cultural front, such as teaching reform, major comprehensive scientific research, and fundamental political and ideological issues in literature and art.

    The declaration finally called for strengthening unity among all nationalities and organizations on the cultural front, and called for fully applying the conclusions of this congress in practice.

    In a letter to the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the congress guaranteed that Czechoslovak cultural workers will creatively accomplish the socialist cultural revolution.

    During the four days of discussions at the congress, approximately fifty delegates spoke. They talked about their profound experiences in contacting the masses in the recent period, and conveyed the working people's demands and opinions on cultural work. The poet Skala said: "The genius of a writer is not the so-called writing technique, but the writer's ability to understand life. Only in close connection with actual life can a writer's talent be developed."

    Many delegates also spoke of the urgent significance of carrying out teaching reforms, improving the compulsory education system, and strengthening rural education work.

    Scientists focused on discussing how to better serve socialist construction through scientific research in their speeches.

    The speeches of delegates from rural areas, factories, border regions, and grassroots party organizations often received enthusiastic applause from the audience. They introduced the material and cultural life of the working people in various places and conveyed the masses' gratitude and praise for cultural workers. They candidly put forward many suggestions and criticisms.

    Guests from seventeen countries delivered speeches at the meeting. Their speeches were greeted with heartfelt cheers from the delegates, and the whole audience frequently stood up and applauded.

    One of the highlights of the closing meeting was the attendance of the famous peace fighter, black singer Paul Robeson. When he appeared at the venue and then took the stage to speak, the audience stood up and applauded warmly many times, and shouted "Long live peace." Robeson congratulated the Czechoslovak people on their great victories in building socialism and defending peace with passionate language and beautiful songs. After the meeting closed, he also gave a wonderful performance for the delegates in the hall.
