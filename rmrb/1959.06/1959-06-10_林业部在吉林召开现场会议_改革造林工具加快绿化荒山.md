Xinhua News Agency, Changchun News: The National On-Site Meeting on Reform of Afforestation Tools, which recently closed in Tao'an County, Jilin Province, called on all regions to immediately launch a reform movement of afforestation tools, based on the principles of "relying on the masses, self-reliance, using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, comprehensive reform, and continuous reform," and with "state-owned nurseries as the core, and commune production teams as the foundation, everyone participating and everyone contributing ideas." It is planned to reform more than 1,100 types of tools and promote more than 5.72 million new tools this year.

The meeting held that, due to the unprecedentedly huge achievements in the reform of afforestation tools in 1958, state-owned nurseries and forest farms in our country have developed from local tool reforms to a new stage of comprehensive tool improvement and semi-mechanization, initially changing the backwardness of nursery and forest farm tools. Great achievements have also been made in mass tool reform. From seed collection and seedling cultivation to afforestation and tending, a complete set of improved tools has emerged, laying the foundation for further carrying out the afforestation tool reform movement in the future.

The meeting pointed out that actively carrying out the reform of afforestation tools will play a significant role in improving the efficiency of afforestation work, accelerating the greening of barren mountains and wasteland, and "realizing the gardenization of the land." It is estimated that there are 6 billion mu of barren mountains and wasteland that can be afforested nationwide. If a large number of new tools are used, labor can be greatly reduced and greening can be accelerated. For example, in the state-owned nursery in Beizhen County, Liaoning Province, because it has basically achieved semi-mechanization, the main operations of the nursery last year saved an average of more than half the labor compared with manual labor.

After summarizing the achievements and problems of past afforestation tool reforms, the meeting pointed out that the current afforestation tool reform movement in our country should follow the path of "mainly using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, starting from scratch, growing from small to large, and evolving from simple to complex," and focus on strengthening the reform of existing tools. Tool reform should be comprehensive, but it is also necessary to grasp the key points. The current focus of reform should be mountain afforestation tools, especially land preparation and young forest tending tools. The meeting called on all regions to closely rely on the local Party committees to incorporate the afforestation tool reform work into the entire agricultural tool reform plan, with unified leadership, unified deployment, unified inspection, and unified arrangement of raw materials and manufacturing work.

### 林业部在吉林召开现场会议  改革造林工具加快绿化荒山

    林业部在吉林召开现场会议
    改革造林工具加快绿化荒山
    新华社长春讯　最近在吉林省洮安县闭幕的全国造林工具改革现场会议，要求各地根据“依靠群众、自力更生、土法上马、土洋结合、全面改革、不断改革”的方针，立即掀起一个以“国营场圃为核心、公社生产队为基础，人人动手，个个献计”的造林工具改革运动。在今年内改革工具一千一百多种，推广新工具五百七十二万多件。
    会议认为，由于1958年造林工具改革工作获得了空前巨大的成就，我国国营苗圃、林场已由局部的工具改革，发展到全面工具改良化和实现半机械化的新阶段，初步的改变了苗圃、林场工具的落后面貌。在群众工具改革方面的成绩也是很大的。从采种、育苗到造林抚育，出现了一整套的改良工具，给今后进一步开展造林工具改革运动打下了基础。
    会议指出，积极进行造林工具改革对提高造林工作的效率、加速绿化荒山荒地和“实现大地园林化”将起重大作用。据估计，全国可以造林的荒山荒地有六十亿亩，如果大量使用新工具，就可以大大减少用工，加速绿化。像辽宁省北镇县国营苗圃由于基本上实现了半机械化，去年苗圃的主要作业比手工劳动平均省工一半以上。
    会议在总结了过去造林工具改革的成绩和问题后指出，目前我国的造林工具改革运动应走“以土法为主、土洋结合、由无到有、由小到大、由简到繁”的道路，着重加强对现有工具的改革。工具改革既要全面，又要掌握重点。当前改革的重点应该是山地造林工具，尤其是整地和幼林抚育工具。会议要求各地要紧紧的依靠当地党委把造林工具改革工作纳入整个农具改革规划之内，统一领导、统一部署、统一检查、统一安排原材料和制造工作。
