Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 16th: Li郢孜 Second Mine in Huainan Coal Mine has strengthened enterprise management, mobilized the masses to improve and implement various rules and regulations, and achieved remarkable results in safe and high production for 22 consecutive months since it was put into production. Because the safety production work is well done, the normal production is guaranteed. The production enthusiasm of the workers in this mine has been very high, and the output of coal has been rising linearly.

Since its completion and commissioning in August 1957, Li郢孜 Second Mine in Huainan has strengthened production management in all aspects, and has successively established 26 kinds of technical operation regulations and responsibility systems for safe production of coal mining, tunneling, pillar return, maintenance, electromechanical transportation, etc.; and established mass safety duty system, safety meetings and other systems to ensure the implementation of these rules and regulations. In the process of implementation, they also promptly mobilized the masses to discuss, supplement and revise the rules and regulations according to the changes of environment, location and time, and the reform of production technology, so as to achieve both destruction and construction. Since the beginning of this year, they have further revised and supplemented various operating procedures for electromechanical transportation and rules and regulations for mining, excavation, and roof management based on the opinions expressed by the masses.

While establishing and improving the rules and regulations, this mine actively carried out mass safety supervision activities, mobilizing the masses to fight against violations of regulations. Each production zone, team, class, and group has a safety inspector who does not leave production. In the past 22 months, a total of more than 7,790 problems affecting safe production have been discovered and reported, and various accidents have been avoided in a timely manner.

This newspaper, Jiaozuo, June 16th: The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau mobilized workers and masses to carry out a safety production inspection campaign centered on "eight investigations and three findings," and eliminated various accidents in a timely manner before they happened, ensuring safe production. In May, there were very few industrial injury accidents. By the beginning of June, serious injury accidents had been eliminated.

Before May, the mines under the bureau had a tendency to emphasize output while neglecting safety. Wherever an accident occurred, they would go there to solve it, forming a situation of treating the head when it aches and the foot when it hurts, and failing to improve safety work in a comprehensive way in advance. At the same time, for a period of time, the failure to promptly improve and establish reasonable rules and regulations resulted in continuous industrial injury accidents, which seriously affected production.

In order to quickly reverse this situation, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, according to the instructions of the Jiaozuo Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, established a safety production command headquarters from the end of April and mobilized the masses from top to bottom to carry out the "eight investigations and three findings" safety production inspection campaign. The eight investigations are: investigating unsafe thinking, investigating industrial injury accidents, investigating adventurous people, investigating violations of regulations and systems, investigating engineering specifications and quality, investigating violations of labor discipline, and investigating blank spots and weak links, etc.; the three findings are: finding the reasons, finding the key, and finding the methods and measures.

Since May, in the mass safety production inspection, various mines have discovered more than 8,000 unsafe factors. According to the degree of importance and urgency, the mine leaders and engineers went deep into the site and worked with the workers to research and solve problems. More than 7,000 items have been resolved so far, thereby ensuring safe production.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 16th: From June 6th to 13th, the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the National Committee of the China Construction Trade Union held a safety production experience exchange meeting in Tianjin, exchanging more than 80 safety production experiences of more than 40 units.

The main experience of these units in eliminating major casualties in construction is, first of all, that the Party organizations attach importance to safety production, conscientiously implement the policy of "production must be safe, safety is for production," and carry out safety production education among workers and masses, so that workers and masses realize that safety and production are inseparable as a whole. At the same time, vigorously carry out mass safety production campaigns, mobilize the masses to conduct regular safety production inspections, and formulate detailed safety production construction operation plans. In addition, these units can strictly abide by safety production rules and regulations, and pay attention to seasonal characteristics and take different safety measures to ensure construction.

The meeting also decided to launch a "100 Days Without Accidents Campaign" in the national construction system from the end of June to the end of September.

    加强职工安全教育　全面健全安全制度
    把事故消灭在发生之前
    淮南和焦作煤矿认真贯彻安全生产方针  全国建筑单位将开展“百日无事故运动”
    据新华社合肥16日电　淮南煤矿李郢孜二矿加强企业管理，发动群众健全和贯彻执行各种规章制度，获得了投入生产以来连续二十二个月安全高产的显著成绩。由于安全生产工作做得好，保证了生产的正常进行，这个矿职工们的生产情绪一直很饱满，煤的产量直线上升。
    淮南李郢孜二矿自1957年8月建成投入生产以来，就从各个方面加强生产管理，先后建立了采煤、掘进、回柱、修护、机电运输等二十六种安全生产的技术操作规程和责任制度；并且建立了群众性的安全值班制、安全例会等制度，保证这些规章制度的执行。在执行过程中，他们又根据环境、地点和时间的变化，生产技术的改革，及时地发动群众讨论补充和修改规章制度，做到了有破有立。今年以来，他们就根据群众鸣放出来的意见，进一步修改和补充了机电运输的各种操作规程和采掘、顶板管理等规章制度。
    在建立和健全规章制度的同时，这个矿积极地展开了群众性的安全监督活动，发动群众向违章作业的现象作斗争。每个生产区、队、班、组，都设有不脱离生产的安全检查员，在过去二十二个月中，共发现和反映了各种影响安全生产的问题七千七百九十多件，及时地避免了各种事故的发生。
    本报焦作16日电　焦作矿务局发动职工群众开展了以“八查三找”为中心的安全生产大检查运动，及时地把各种事故消灭在发生之前，保证了安全生产。5月份工伤事故很少发生，到6月上旬，已经消灭了重伤事故。
    在5月份以前，这个局所属的各矿由于有一种重产量轻安全的思想，哪里发生了事故，就到哪里去解决，形成头痛医头、脚痛医脚，不能事先对安全工作进行全面的改善。同时，有一段时间，由于没有及时地健全和建立合理的规章制度，因而工伤事故不断发生，严重地影响了生产。
    为了迅速地扭转这个局面，焦作矿务局根据中共焦作市委的指示，从4月下旬开始成立了安全生产指挥部，自上而下地发动群众，开展了“八查三找”安全生产大检查运动。八查是：查不安全思想，查工伤事故，查冒险人，查违犯规程制度，查工程规格质量，查不遵劳动纪律，查空白点和薄弱环节等；三找是：找原因，找关键，找办法措施。
    从5月份以来，各矿在群众的安全生产大检查中，发现了不安全的因素共八千多项。根据轻重缓急，矿上领导干部和工程师深入现场和工人一起，边研究、边解决，现在已经解决的有七千多项，从而保证了安全生产。
    据新华社天津16日电　建筑工程部和中国建筑工会全国委员会6日到13日在天津召开建筑系统安全生产经验交流会议，交流了四十多个单位的八十多项安全生产经验。
    这些单位在建筑施工中杜绝重大伤亡事故的主要经验，首先是党组织重视安全生产工作，认真贯彻“生产必须安全，安全为了生产”的方针，在职工群众中开展安全生产教育，使职工群众认识到安全和生产是不可分的整体。同时，大搞群众性的安全生产运动，发动群众定期进行安全生产大检查，订出细致的安全生产施工作业计划。此外这些单位都能严格地遵守安全生产规章制度，并且注意季节特点，采取不同的安全措施，保证施工。
    这次会议并决定，从6月底到9月底，要在全国建筑系统中开展一个“百日无事故运动”。
