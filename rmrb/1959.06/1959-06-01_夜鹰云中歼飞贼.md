On the night of May 29th, dark clouds filled the sky over Guangdong, with a drizzle falling. The night was as black as an overturned iron pot. At around ten o'clock that evening, Lieutenant Jiang Zhelun, an on-duty pilot, was waiting with his comrades in the lounge when a command suddenly came through the phone from the command post: "First-level readiness!" Jiang Zhelun jumped up, quickly ran to the tarmac, and received the order to start the engine. In a burst of roaring engines, the Night Hawk spat out fiery red tongues, sped across the runway, pierced the night sky, and flew straight towards the battle zone.

At this time, an American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft was taking advantage of such adverse complex night weather to intrude into the airspace of Guangdong Province for harassment and sabotage. The personnel in our airport control room were intently searching for intelligence on the enemy aircraft, guiding the Night Hawk's sortie. Commander Li Xiangang frequently leaned out the window to look at the pitch-black night and discussed tactics for attacking the enemy aircraft with his assistants. At the plotting table in the intelligence station, plotters Jiang Xintian and Tang Guoguang very precisely marked the changing positions of the enemy and our aircraft on the map. As the distance between the enemy and our aircraft became shorter and shorter, their emotions became more and more tense. When our aircraft tracked the enemy aircraft, they could not contain their inner excitement and said excitedly, "Good! Caught up, the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft will definitely not escape!"

At this time, in the dark sea of clouds, pilot Jiang Zhelun, piloting the Night Hawk, quickly approached the enemy aircraft under the correct guidance of the ground command post, a distance of seven kilometers, five kilometers, four kilometers... but nothing could be seen. It was not until he was more than three kilometers away from the enemy aircraft that he spotted a target on the lower right side of his instruments. He immediately determined that this target was the cunning flying thief. He said to himself, "Must not miss this opportunity!" So, he immediately adjusted the difference in direction and altitude, and when he reached the attack distance, he pressed the cannon button, and a string of tracer bullets shot towards the target. However, these fiery red tracer bullets stung Jiang Zhelun's eyes so badly that he could not open them, and he could not even see the instruments clearly. He had to fire fiercely for two seconds. Then, he slightly pulled the control stick and leveled the plane. When his vision returned, he saw a ball of fire under the right wing, gradually receding. He determined that the enemy aircraft had been hit! He immediately reported to the ground command post: "Hit! Hit!"

Next, Jiang Zhelun wanted to launch a second attack, but when the plane quickly passed through the clouds, he could not see anything. He was worried that the flying thief had escaped and immediately requested ground guidance. At this time, the firm voice of the ground commander rang in his headset: "Fight resolutely, fight fiercely, and be sure to shoot it down!" He continued to track according to the direction of the guidance, and suddenly saw a large ball of fire on the lower left in a cloud gap.

"This time you can't escape!" Jiang Zhelun felt a burst of joy and quickly prepared for an attack in the direction of the ball of fire. When he entered the attack distance, he suddenly fired a more intense string of tracer bullets at the enemy aircraft. But the enemy aircraft immediately disappeared into the clouds again. Jiang Zhelun kept a close eye on this guy, and as soon as he came out of the clouds, he saw a large ball of red fire on the rear left, dragging two white trails straight down. Jiang Zhelun wanted to launch a third attack, but he only saw the ball of red fire burning bigger and bigger, bursting out countless sparks, and quickly exploding and crashing to the ground.

This complex and arduous night battle in the clouds was victorious. Our brave Night Hawk overcame the difficulties caused by the adverse weather conditions and shattered this American-made B-17 Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, which dared to intrude into the mainland of the motherland for harassment and sabotage, leaving only half of its tail falling on Naguan Mountain, south of Enping, Guangdong Province. All twelve enemies in the enemy plane were also killed.

    夜鹰云中歼飞贼
    新华社通讯员　陈世基　康　坦
    5月29日夜，广东地区上空乌云密布，细雨蒙蒙，天黑得像倒扣过来的大铁锅一样。晚上十时许，值班飞行员蒋哲伦中尉正和他的战友们在休息室待命的时候，突然从电话里传来了指挥所的命令：“一等准备！”蒋哲伦一跃而起，迅速跑到停机坪，就接到开车的命令。于是，在一阵马达的轰鸣声中，夜鹰喷吐着红艳艳的火舌，驰过跑道，划破夜空，直向战区飞去。
    这时候，一架美制蒋机正利用这样恶劣的夜间复杂气象，窜入了广东省上空进行骚扰破坏活动。我机场指挥室的人员们聚精会神地搜索着敌机情报，引导夜鹰出航。指挥员李宪刚不时地伸头到窗外看看漆黑的夜幕，和助手们研究着打击敌机的战术。在情报站的标图桌旁，标图员蒋心田和唐国光非常精确地把敌机和我机的变换位置，连续标在图纸上。随着敌机和我机的距离越来越近，他们的心情也越来越紧张。当我机跟踪敌机时，他们按捺不住内心的激动，兴奋地说道：“好！追上了，蒋机一定跑不掉！”
    这时，在漆黑的云海中，飞行员蒋哲伦驾着夜鹰，在地面指挥所的正确引导下，很快接近了敌机，距离七公里、五公里、四公里，……但是什么也看不见。直到距离敌机三公里多处，他才从仪表上发现了右下方有一个目标，他立即断定这个目标就是狡猾的飞贼。他在心里对自己说：“决不能错过机会！”于是，立即调整方向差和高度差，到了攻击距离上，便猛一按炮钮，一串曳光弹射向目标。但是，这火红的曳光弹却把蒋哲伦的眼睛刺激得睁不开，连仪表也看不清了。他只得猛烈地射击了两秒钟。然后，他稍一拉操纵杆，把飞机改平。等视力恢复了，才看到右翼下面一团火光，并且渐渐后退。他断定，这是敌机中弹了！于是，马上向地面指挥所报告：“打着火了！打着火了！”
    接着，蒋哲伦想进行第二次攻击，但是当飞机很快穿过云层时，却什么也看不见了。他担心飞贼逃掉了，立刻请求地面引导。这时，耳机里已响起了地面指挥员的坚定声音：“坚决地打，狠狠地打，一定要打下来！”他便按照引导的方向，继续跟踪，忽然在云缝中看到了左下方一大团火光。
      “这下子你可逃不掉了！”蒋哲伦一阵喜悦，朝着这团火光的方向迅速作好攻击准备，等进入攻击距离时，突然把一串更猛烈的曳光弹射向敌机。可是敌机马上又消失在云层中。蒋哲伦紧紧盯住这家伙不放，刚出云层，便看到左后方一大团红火，拖着两条白烟往下直降。蒋哲伦还想进入第三次攻击，却只见这团红火越烧越大，迸射出无数的火花，迅速爆炸坠地了。
    这场复杂、艰苦的云中夜战胜利了。我神勇的夜鹰克服了由于恶劣的气象带来的困难，一举把这架胆敢窜入祖国大陆骚扰破坏的美制B—17型蒋机打得粉碎，只剩下半截尾巴坠落在广东省恩平南面的那关山上。敌机中的十二个敌人也都全部毙命。
