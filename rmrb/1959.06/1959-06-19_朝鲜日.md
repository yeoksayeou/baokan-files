The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council issued a call on June 8, urging the solidarity committees of Asian and African countries to hold "Korea Day" on June 25. On the same day, the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions also issued a statement designating June 25 as the "International Day of Working-Class Solidarity with the Korean Workers and People in their Struggle for the Withdrawal of U.S. Armed Forces from South Korea and the Peaceful Reunification of Korea" to support the just struggle of the Korean people.

In February of this year, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council adopted a resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. The resolution emphasized that Korea should be unified by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis and without foreign interference, through peaceful means. The recommendations on the current situation in Asia and Africa, adopted at the special session of the World Peace Council held in Stockholm in May, also called for the United States to withdraw its armed forces from South Korea without delay and believed that the Korean question should be resolved in accordance with the wishes of the Korean people.

June 25 is the historical day when the Korean people heroically rose up to resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism. Nine years ago, U.S. imperialism, under the cloak of the United Nations, launched the war of aggression against Korea. However, under the joint combat of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, which inflicted heavy blows on the U.S. aggressors, the United States was forced to sign the armistice agreement on July 27, 1953. After the armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides made unremitting efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea on October 26, 1958. However, U.S. imperialism not only refuses to withdraw its troops but also intensifies its sabotage of the armistice agreement, turning South Korea into a base for atomic warfare, threatening Korea and peace in the Far East.

The Korean people firmly demand the withdrawal of U.S. occupation forces from South Korea to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland United Front calls on all Korean people to launch a nationwide struggle to drive out the deadly enemy of the Korean people, U.S. imperialism, as soon as possible.

### “朝鲜日”

    “朝鲜日”
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处于6月8日号召亚非各国团结委员会在6月25日举行“朝鲜日”。同日，世界工联书记处也发表声明，定6月25日为“国际工人阶级声援朝鲜工人和人民争取美国武装部队撤出南朝鲜和和平统一朝鲜的斗争日”，以支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。
    今年2月亚非人民团结理事会曾通过一项决议，要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜。决议强调指出，朝鲜应当由朝鲜人民自己在民主的基础上和不受外国干涉的情况下，采取和平办法来实现统一。5月在斯德哥尔摩举行的世界和平理事会特别会议所通过的关于亚非当前局势的建议中，也要求美国应当毫不拖延地把他们的武装部队撤出南朝鲜，并认为朝鲜问题应当根据朝鲜人民的意愿来解决。
    6月25日是朝鲜人民英勇地起来反击美帝国主义侵略的历史性日子。九年前，美帝国主义披着联合国的外衣发动了侵朝战争。但在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，给予美国侵略者以沉重的打击下，美国被迫于1953年7月27日签订了停战协定。停战以后，朝中方面为和平解决朝鲜问题作了不懈的努力，中国人民志愿军并于1958年10月26日全部撤出朝鲜。可是，美帝国主义不仅拒绝撤军，而且加紧破坏停战协定，把南朝鲜变为原子战争基地，威胁朝鲜和远东和平。
    朝鲜人民坚决要求美国占领军撤出南朝鲜，以促进祖国的和平统一。朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会号召全体朝鲜人民展开全民族的斗争，早日把朝鲜人民的死敌美帝国主义赶出去。　（亚）
