First Visit to Sofia
——Bulgarian Sketches, Part 1
Ling He

To have the opportunity to visit Bulgaria, and as a mission to complete a Sino-Bulgarian cultural exchange, is a glorious and happy thing for me.

After two days of sailing, I arrived over the vicinity of the Bulgarian capital. Looking down, there were forests upon forests, green trees providing shade; rapeseed flowers covering the ground, wheat waves rolling in the wind, truly a beautiful land. The plane circled and descended in the suburbs with tens of thousands of buildings, and I landed in Sofia. The sun was bright and the breeze was gentle, what a refreshing scene, how could it not make one feel relaxed and happy.

It was 7 pm, and it was dusk in the motherland, but here the sun was still hanging high in the western sky. In the hotel dining room, I peered through the window at the very clean road, the garden next to the ancient palace with its green grass like a carpet, ancient trees reaching the sky, and dense shade covering everything. What was most striking was that roses were blooming on the soft grass, and every table in the window had peonies in a vase, the beautiful colors intoxicating.

Comrade Jamilyov of Bulgaria understood my joy, and after dinner, he accompanied me for a walk in the nearby park. The sun had set, but the sky was still very bright. The streets were full of strolling crowds, wearing all kinds of beautiful clothes, with relaxed smiles on their faces, shoulder to shoulder, coming and going. They were dressed so beautifully, and they, whether old or young, were so content. The people of this country truly know how to enjoy the happiness of socialism.

We wandered in the garden, breathing in the rich fragrance of dense leaves and flowers, which turned out to be rows of roses, with large, fragrant, and dewy flowers. Comrade Jamilyov told me that roses are the gold of Bulgaria, because the world-famous rose oil is equivalent to gold, and every year it can earn a lot of foreign exchange to support socialist construction. He also invited me to visit the famous Rose Valley another day, and I am looking forward to this unique trip.

After returning from the park, the streetlights were as bright as day. My excitement was not yet exhausted, and I could not sleep, so I happily composed a twenty-line poem in the ancient style:

First Visit to Sofia

First visit to Sofia,
My homeland’s *tu* fades away,
Eastern Europe still in late spring,
Flowers bloom under dense shade.

Peonies by the thousands of branches,
Roses welcome early summer;
Strange fragrance assaults the nose,
Why need we miss orchids or musk?

Maidens pluck fresh blossoms,
Vases adorn bright windows.
Flowers smile at fair daughters,
Flower fragrance beyond all price,

Outside the window dusk descends,
Inside the window, night is unknown.
Rose oil is distilled,
A world-class hegemony.

Bulgaria builds anew,
Life must be beautified;
Strive to be vanguards,
Show off bright colors in Europe and Asia!

    初游索非亚
    ——保加利亚散记之一
    凌鹤
    得有机会访问保加利亚，而且是作为完成一次中保两国文化交流的任务，这对于我是光荣而幸福的事。
    经过两天的航行，我到了保加利亚首都附近的上空。下望一片又一片的森林，绿树成荫；菜花铺地，麦浪翻风，真是河山秀丽。飞机在千万座建筑物的市郊盘旋下降，我在索非亚着陆了。日丽风和，多么清新的景象啊，怎不令人心旷神怡。
    下午七时了，祖国正是黄昏，可是这里却是太阳还挂在西空高处。我在旅馆的饭厅中，隔窗窥望十分整洁的马路，故宫旁的花园绿草如茵，古木参天，浓荫如盖。最使人注目的是玫瑰盛开在茸茸的草地上，窗中每一桌上都有芍药插在瓶中，美丽的颜色教人心醉。
    保加利亚的贾密流同志懂得我的喜悦，他在饭后陪我到近处的公园中散步。太阳落下了，天空仍然十分明朗。满街是散步的人群，穿着各色各样的漂亮的服装，脸上泛着悠闲的微笑，磨肩接踵，你来我往。她们打扮得那末美，他们中无论是老者或是青年，都那末怡然自得。这个国度的人们啊，太懂得享受社会主义的幸福了。
    我们倘佯在花园中，呼吸着密叶花丛的浓香，原来是玫瑰成畦，花朵肥大，馥郁欲滴。贾密流同志告诉我，玫瑰是保加利亚的黄金，因为驰名世界的玫瑰油，和黄金等价，每年可换取不少外汇，以资社会主义建设。他并约我改日同游有名的玫瑰谷，我期待着这别有风味的旅行。
    公园游归，街灯辉煌犹如白昼。兴有未尽，不能入睡，欣然得五古二十句如下：
    初游索非亚，故国荼?罢，
    东欧尚暮春，花发浓荫下。
    芍药万千枝，玫瑰迎初夏；
    奇香扑鼻闻，何须让兰麝？
    少女摘新葩，瓶插明窗榭。
    花笑女儿娇，花香无论价，
    窗外欲黄昏，窗中不知夜。
    玫瑰酿香精，世界堪称霸。
    保国建设新，生活应美化；
    努力争前驱，艳色夸欧亚！
