    A Sparkling Little Star
    ——Watching the Children's Film "The Amusing Adventures of Koer"
    Xie Fengsong
    I sat with the children to watch "The Amusing Adventures of Koer." The film depicts the children's daily life; there are neither thrilling plots nor tense and bizarre stories. However, judging from the children's reactions while watching the film, they were captivated. They traveled with Koer in the film, resonating with his experiences. When Koer laughed, they laughed too, and when Koer encountered difficulties, they also felt anxious. After the film ended, they were still happy for Koer's successful first solo trip and the many new friends he made! The film used a clever and artistic key to open the door to a beautiful childlike heart for the young audience, allowing everyone to see an innocent and lovely world.
    Koer is a five-year-old boy from a kindergarten in Prague. During the beautiful season when apples ripened, his grandfather, who lived in the countryside, invited him to visit. His parents were busy with work and couldn't take him, so he asked his mother to allow him to take an interesting trip alone. The film meticulously depicts Koer's life: In the kindergarten, Koer, like other children, bounces balls, swings, and teases the horses pulling carts on the roadside. When the train passes through a tunnel, he is afraid, so he sings loudly to boost his courage. The author also writes about his good deeds that surpass those of ordinary children, demonstrating the new qualities of the young generation. For example, when he discovers that he hasn't brought a gift for his grandmother, he touches his head and decides to give his beloved glass ball to her. This segment is meticulous, touching and revealing. Koer reluctantly gives the glass ball to his grandmother, who puts it in a glass cup. After his grandmother leaves, he immediately climbs onto a chair and looks at his beloved glass ball in the glass cup from outside the glass cabinet. After a few days, he "borrows" the glass ball back from his grandmother to play with. People see from this the child's innocence, understanding, and politeness. He and the naughty Ferda go to the forest to look for a cat, but Ferda leaves him and runs away. When other children find him on the grass, the first thing he thinks of is: "Where's Ferda? He's probably lost." This sentence highlights Koer's excellent quality of caring for his little companions. Of course, Koer also has shortcomings compared to other children; he doesn't know that a dog is not only a dog but also "man's faithful friend"; he doesn't know that a cat has four legs and says it has five legs...
    These scenes make people feel more and more that Koer is adorable. He is innocent, lively, clever, and full of childishness. To make such meticulous descriptions, one must have a meticulous observation of children's lives in normal times; only a screenwriter and director who are thoroughly familiar with children's lives and psychology can guide the young actors to perform so unobtrusively and appropriately. Now, people don't think Koer is a character on the screen, but rather a cute child right next to them. This is a tender and beautiful bud illuminated by the glory of socialist society, a sparkling little star.
    The film does not use language but, through the unique artistic expression, naturally, fluently, and enthusiastically praises the socialist system and reflects the new social atmosphere and new morality. Before Koer gets on the train, he says to his mother: "I know, Mom, don't run around in the carriage... I will definitely not stick my head out the window." These words sound very ordinary, but they make people think that in today's society, kindergartens, families, public places, etc., are constantly educating children and caring for them everywhere. Koer forgets his suitcase when he gets off the train, and the female train attendant carefully throws the suitcase down while the train is moving. Koer goes over to pick up the suitcase and waves to thank the aunt in the speeding train. This wave makes people think of so many things! The new society teaches children to be both disciplined and polite! Through the old man guarding the railway reading Koer's letter, the warm care of the female train attendant and the male ticket inspector for Koer on the train, the concern of the passenger in the same carriage for Koer, the education of the farm teacher for Koer, the action of the female cook in the canteen adding a fried pancake for Koer, the help and friendship of children like Tailecika for Koer, etc., it naturally reflects the entire society's care, concern, and cultivation for the younger generation. The reason why Koer grows up so lovely is precisely because he is nurtured by this lovely society.
    Through Koer's simple life story, the film also tells the young audience: Koer's first solo trip far away from home, the first time sitting alone in a carriage passing through a dark tunnel, these are important tests for children. Life in the countryside lets Koer know many new things he didn't know in the city and learns to help his grandfather with work. The new people of communism should be cultivated from an early age. Letting children live in the countryside, do some labor, see the world, and gain some knowledge can cultivate their feelings for the land, for labor, and for the working people.
    Children in socialist society are like stars in the sky, shining brightly. We hope that our writers and artists will often delve into this galaxy, use artistic means to pluck a few, dozens, or hundreds of little stars, and put them in books, plays, and movies, so that they can illuminate the hearts of more children.

    一颗晶亮的小星
    ——看儿童故事片“柯儿趣游记”
    谢逢松
    和孩子们坐在一起看了一场“柯儿趣游记”。影片写的全是孩子们日常的生活，既没有惊心动魄的情节，又没有紧张离奇的故事，可是从孩子们看影片时的反应来看，他们是被影片吸引住了。他们和影片中的柯儿一同旅行，心心相印，柯儿笑了，他们也笑了，柯儿遇到困难，他们也在着急。这部片子完了，他们还在为柯儿首次独个儿旅行成功，获得了许多新朋友而高兴哩！影片用巧妙的艺术的钥匙，向小观众们打开了一颗美丽童心的大门，使大家看到一个天真烂漫可爱的世界。
    柯儿是布拉格幼儿园一个五岁的男孩子，在苹果熟了的美丽季节，住在乡下的爷爷请他去玩。爸爸妈妈工作忙，没法送他去，他就请求妈妈允许他一个人作了一次有趣的旅行。电影细致地描绘了柯儿的生活：在幼儿园里柯儿和别的孩子一样，拍皮球，打秋千，逗路边套着车的马。坐火车过山洞的时候，他害怕，就大声地唱起歌来为自己壮胆。作者又写了他高于一般孩子的良好举动，表现了年幼一代的新品质。比如：当他发现自己没有给奶奶带来礼物，摸了摸脑袋后，便决定把自己心爱的玻璃球送给奶奶。这一段描写是细致入微、动人的。柯儿恋恋不舍地把玻璃球送给了奶奶，奶奶将它装在玻璃杯里，等奶奶出去了，他立刻爬到椅子上，从玻璃橱外看玻璃杯里那个他心爱的玻璃球；过了些日子，又向奶奶把玻璃球“借”回来玩。人们从这里看到，孩子的天真，懂理，有礼貌。他和调皮的费尔达到林子里去找猫，费尔达甩下他溜跑了。当别的小朋友在草地上发现他时，他首先想到的是：“费尔达在哪儿？他大概迷路了。”一句话就点出了柯儿爱护小同伴的优秀品质。当然，柯儿也有不及别的孩子的地方，他不知道狗除了是狗之外，还是“人的忠实的朋友”；他不知道猫是四只脚，而说成五只脚……。
    这些镜头，使人越看越觉得柯儿可爱。他天真活泼，聪明伶俐，而又稚气十足。作这样细致入微的描写，平时对儿童的生活必须有细致入微的体察；只有熟透了儿童的生活和心理的编导者，才能诱导小演员作这样不露痕迹、恰如其分的表演。现在，人们没有觉得柯儿是银幕上的人物，而觉得就是自己身边的一个可爱的孩子。这是社会主义社会光辉照耀的一朵鲜嫩的、美丽的蓓蕾，一颗晶亮的小星。
    影片不是用语言，而是通过艺术表现的特有手法，自然而流利地、热情地赞颂着社会主义制度，反映新社会的新风气、新道德。柯儿上车前对妈妈说了这样一段话：“我知道，妈妈，坐在车厢里不要乱跑……我一定不把头伸到窗外去。”这些话，听起来很平凡，可它却使人想到在今天这样的社会里，幼儿园、家庭、公共场所等，无时不在谆谆教育儿童，处处关怀儿童。柯儿下火车忘了箱子，女列车员在火车开动中小心地把箱子丢了下来，柯儿过去捡起箱子，还向疾驰的列车里的阿姨挥手致谢。这一挥手，又使人想到多少事情啊！新社会教导儿童既懂规矩、又识礼貌！通过护路的老头给柯儿读信，火车上女列车员和男检票员对柯儿的热情照顾，同一车厢那个旅客对柯儿的关怀，农庄教师对柯儿的教导，食堂女炊事员给柯儿加一块油煎饼的举动，苔列茨卡这些小孩对柯儿的帮助和友情，等等，很自然地体现了整个社会对幼年一代的照顾、关怀和培育。柯儿所以会长得这样可爱，正是这个可爱的社会孕育出来的。
    通过柯儿简单的生活故事，影片也告诉了小观众：柯儿第一次单独出远门，第一次独个儿坐在车厢里穿过漆黑的山洞，这些对孩子，是重要的考验。乡下的生活让柯儿知道了许多在城市里不知道的新事物，学习了帮爷爷劳动。共产主义的新人，应该从小就开始培植。让孩子到乡下去住住，作些劳动，见见世面，长点知识，可以通过这些来培养他们对土地的感情，对劳动的感情，对劳动人民的感情。
    社会主义社会的儿童，像满天的星斗，闪闪发光。希望我们的作家和艺术家，经常深入到这星群中去，用艺术的手摘下几颗、几十颗、几百颗小星来，放到书里去，放到戏里去，放到电影里去，让它再去照亮更多儿童的心。（附图片）
