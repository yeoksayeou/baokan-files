Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: The various branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), on the basis of a bumper summer harvest in sideline production, are actively preparing to sow autumn vegetables, expand pig farms and poultry farms, and store summer vegetables. Many units' leading organs have recently issued instructions, calling on troops to see the autumn harvest after the summer harvest, and to think of the off-season during the peak season. During the autumn sowing, they should "plant every piece of land and make full use of every inch of soil," expanding the planting area so that the troops can strive for self-sufficiency in non-staple foods even in the off-season.

The Party Committee of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison recently held a special meeting to study the troops' agricultural and sideline production, requiring subordinate units to seize the agricultural season, strengthen field management of existing vegetables, and actively prepare for the sowing of autumn and winter vegetables. In accordance with the instructions of the Party Committee, the officers and soldiers are vying to use the gaps between duty and training to deeply plow the open space after the spring vegetable harvest, and vigorously reclaim available land around the barracks and within the warehouses and training grounds, preparing to plant autumn crops such as Chinese cabbage and radish. When deploying production tasks recently, the Zhejiang Military Region required all units to quickly plant autumn vegetables on uncultivated land, and to change the original "single crop system" to a "multi-crop system" according to climate and other conditions. The troops stationed in the Zhoushan Islands, with the determination to "seize every opportunity and plant every piece of land," used their spare time to open up a large number of small pieces of wasteland and planted a large number of autumn and winter vegetables.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables, the logistics departments of many units recently held production technology exchange meetings or on-site sideline production meetings, summarizing the experience of spring production, implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and gradually promoting garden cultivation. Troops in Shenyang, Wuhan, Kunming and other places have also opened a number of small chemical fertilizer plants to solve the fertilizer problem for autumn vegetable fields.

In order to ensure the supply of meat, chicken, duck, fish, etc. in the coming winter and spring, all troops are expanding pig farms, poultry farms, and pastures. The Second Company of a certain unit stationed in Shandong recently raised an average of three pigs per person and an average of one and a half sheep per person. The piglet breeding farm opened by a certain unit has grown from more than 300 heads in the spring to more than 3,000 heads, and each pig is growing fat and strong. The East China Sea Fleet of the Navy raised 3,000 pigs in the spring, and now it has increased to 7,000. They are planning to plant water hyacinth, sweet potatoes, dried vegetables, pigweed, etc., and are stepping up preparations and storage of winter pig feed. A certain cavalry unit stationed in Xinjiang recently planted hundreds of acres of alfalfa grass to prepare winter feed for cattle and sheep on the pasture. Troops near Baiyangdian, Weishan Lake, Hongze Lake and other places have also established duck farms and chicken farms by the lake and river, breeding and raising their own livestock, and achieving self-sufficiency. Some troops have also dug fish ponds to raise fish for winter consumption. With the increase in livestock and poultry, the veterinary departments of various units are researching and manufacturing veterinary drugs.

While vigorously preparing to sow autumn vegetables, all troops are also stepping up the storage of summer vegetables, seeking to make up for the shortage of the off-season with the production of the peak season. Many troops have recently specially transferred manpower to process vegetables, drying or pickling the vegetables that cannot be eaten at present. Some troops have also established non-staple food processing factories to manufacture various pickles and pickled vegetables.

    解放军争取淡季副食品自给
    扩种秋季蔬菜　增养家畜家禽
    据新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军各兵种部队，在副业生产夏季大丰收的基础上，正在积极准备播种秋季蔬菜，扩大养猪场、家禽场，储存夏季蔬菜。许多部队领导机关最近发出指示，号召部队夏收看到秋收，旺季想到淡季，在秋播时作到“有地必种，寸土不闲”，扩大播种面积，使部队在淡季也能争取副食品自给。
    北京地区部队某部党委，最近专门开会研究部队的农副业生产，要求所属部队抓紧农事季节，加强对现有蔬菜的田间管理，积极进行秋冬蔬菜的播种准备。广大官兵根据党委指示，争相利用执勤、训练的空隙，一面深翻春菜收割后的空地，一面大力开垦营房周围和仓库、教练场内可以利用的土地，准备种大白菜、萝卜等秋季作物。浙江军区最近布置生产任务时，要求各部队把尚未种植的土地迅速种上秋菜，原来准备“一熟制”的根据气候等条件改成“多熟制”。驻舟山群岛的部队在“见缝插针，有地必种”的决心下，官兵们利用空隙时间开出了大批小块荒地，种上了大批秋冬蔬菜。
    为了保证秋菜大丰收，许多部队后勤部门最近召开了生产技术交流会或副业生产现场会，总结春季生产经验，贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”，逐步推行园田化。沈阳、武汉、昆明等地部队，还开办了一批小型化学肥料厂，来解决秋季菜田的肥料问题。
    各部队为了保证今冬明春肉、鸡、鸭、鱼等的供应，都在扩大养猪场、家禽场和牧场。驻山东的某部二连最近养的猪平均每人三头，养的羊平均每人一只半。某部开办的猪仔繁殖场由春天三百多头发展到三千多头，而且每只猪都长得膘肥体壮。海军东海舰队春天养猪三千头，现在增加到七千头。他们正在有计划的种水浮莲、地瓜、晒青菜、猪草等，加紧准备和储存冬季的猪饲料。驻新疆的某骑兵部队最近还赶种了上百亩的苜蓿草，为牧场里的牛羊准备冬季饲料。在白洋淀、微山湖、洪泽湖等附近的部队，还在湖畔河旁建立了养鸭场、养鸡场，自繁自养，自给自足。有些部队还挖了鱼塘养鱼，准备冬季食用。随着家畜、家禽的增多，各部队兽医部门都在研究和制造畜用药品。
    在大力准备播种秋菜的同时，各部队也在加紧进行夏季蔬菜的储藏工作，求得以旺季的生产弥补淡季的不足。许多部队最近专门抽调人力，进行蔬菜加工，把目前吃不完的青菜晒干或者腌制起来。有些部队还成立了副食品加工厂，制造各种酱菜、泡菜。
