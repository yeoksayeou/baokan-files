I Love Teaching

Gao Jiaying, Fourth-Year Student, Chinese Department, East China Normal University

Four years ago today, as I was about to step out of the middle school gate, I excitedly discussed ideals and work with my classmates. We talked and debated, trying to choose the most ideal job for ourselves. However, all kinds of jobs in the new society radiated dazzling brilliance, and which one didn't possess powerful charm! What exactly should I choose?

By chance, I went to see the movie "The Rural Teacher," and I was deeply attracted by it at the time. Hua Erhua Na bravely faced wind, snow, and ice in order to realize her beautiful ideals, and finally, she gained lofty honor. Teacher, what a tempting job!

Walking out of the cinema, I looked at the beautiful starry sky, and it felt as if every star was the bright eyes of children twinkling. I even imitated Hua Erhua Na and spoke to the stars: "Children, from today onwards, I am your teacher, and my name is Hua Erhua Na..." Yes, from that moment on, I was determined to dedicate my life's energy to the motherland's education.

In this way, I entered East China Normal University with ecstatic feelings to study. At the meeting to welcome new students, the school leader congratulated us, saying: "You will be engineers of the human soul, and the country will entrust its hopes and future entirely to you." Ah, the country and the people entrust their future and hopes to us, what a huge responsibility, what a lofty honor! However, I knew that a person cannot obtain a lifetime of honor in one morning; it must be earned through tenacious and arduous labor struggles. Didn't Hua Erhua Na pay such a price? Therefore, I realized that a glorious and difficult road lay before me.

First of all, teachers undertake a very important task: cultivating new people. Teachers must create new people for socialism and communism so that these new people will take on the important task of building communism in the future. Since the teacher's responsibility is so important, the teacher's work has many difficulties. Teachers should constantly improve their thinking and should continuously absorb everything useful from people's lives, from science and art. Otherwise, if society is advancing and teachers are stagnant, how can we talk about cultivating new people for society? Therefore, every time I wake up in the morning, my first thought is: Study hard, children are reaching out to us for knowledge; if I encounter difficulties in learning, as long as I think of the countless little hands reaching out to us, I have the courage to overcome the difficulties; before going to bed at night, I often check myself: How much have I learned for the children today? Yes! For the sake of the children, for the sake of the motherland, a teacher should persevere in learning throughout his or her life.

But more importantly, teachers should have extremely noble character. Because education is not only a scientific undertaking but also an artistic undertaking, an art of educating people. Teachers bear the important responsibility of influencing students' minds and morals. Kalinin said: "The teacher's every move is under the strictest supervision, and no one in the world is subject to such strict supervision." He also said, "Every day, the teacher seems to be squatting in front of a mirror, and hundreds of pairs of keen, sensitive children's eyes, good at spying out the teacher's advantages and disadvantages, are constantly staring at him." Yes, aren't we also one of these strict supervisors? We like to imitate the teacher's every move, and the teacher's words and deeds are more likely to leave a deep impression on us.

Therefore, when I first went to middle school for an internship, I paid close attention to my actions and words, fearing that I would bring any adverse effects to the students. Of course, good character cannot be formed overnight; it must be cultivated in daily life by constantly strictly demanding oneself and paying attention to every small behavior. As the saying goes: Sow a behavior, reap a habit, sow a habit, reap a character. Teachers should attach importance to cultivating their good behaviors and habits in daily life.

Speaking of this, some people may feel that being a teacher is too difficult. Yes, being a teacher, being a good teacher is indeed not easy. But we know that in life, it is the difficult things, not the easy things, that are interesting. For example, when solving an algebra problem, if you don't need to use your brain much and you figure it out all at once, you will definitely find it too boring. But if you encounter a difficult problem and it takes a lot of effort to figure it out, what will happen then? You will definitely shout happily: "It's really interesting, this kind of problem is really interesting!" The work of a teacher is also like this, difficult and interesting.

I remember when I participated in a teaching internship last year, the first time I gave a Chinese class to students, lecturing on "Never Lag Behind." How much time and energy did I spend in order to teach this lesson well, even reciting the lecture notes in my dreams. After class, I was working with the students in the assembly room when I suddenly heard two students arguing:

"No, you are perfunctory!"

"Forget it, it's a little bit off, who can see it?"

"It must be disassembled and reassembled! I want to be responsible to the motherland for you!"

"..."

Silence, followed by the sound of disassembling and assembling machine parts. I was so happy that I almost shed tears. I didn't expect that the story of Golovoy and Globa being responsible to each other in front of the motherland, which I talked about in class, would soon have an impact on the students. Yes, the four words "Never Lag Behind" will leave a deep impression on their entire lives. The teacher's labor was not in vain.

That internship was only twenty days long, and I had already experienced the arduousness of the teacher's work and the importance of the teacher's responsibility. No, what I felt even more deeply was the happiness of being a teacher.

In just over a month, I will graduate and soon formally engage in my ideal career. At that time, I will bear greater responsibilities, encounter more difficulties, and at the same time, gain more happiness. Really, I feel that there is no happier job in the world than cultivating people. When people recall the good times of their student days, who can fail to think of their respected teachers at the same time? The teacher's happiness is here, the teacher's glory is also here, and the teacher is such a glorious and tempting job.

    我热爱教师工作
    华东师大中文系四年级学生　高家莺
    四年前的今天，在即将迈出中学大门时，我怀着激动的心情与同学们谈理想、谈工作。我们谈着、争论着，努力要为自己选择一个最理想的工作。可是，新社会各种各样的工作都发出耀眼的光辉，哪一样不具有强大的魅力呢！我究竟选择什么好呢？
    一个偶然的机会，我去看了“乡村女教师”的电影，我当时被它深深吸引住了。华尔华娜为了实现她美丽的理想，勇敢地去迎接风雪冰霜，最后她获得了崇高的荣誉。教师，多么诱人的工作啊！
    走出电影院，我望着美丽的星空，只觉得每一颗星星都仿佛是孩子们明亮的眼睛在闪烁。我竟学着华尔华娜对星星说起话来：“孩子们，从今天起，我是你们的老师，我的名字叫华尔华娜……。”是的，从这时起，我已决心像华尔华娜一样，把自己的毕生精力都献给祖国的教育事业了。
    就这样，我怀着狂喜的心情，进入了华东师大学习。欢迎新学生的会上，校首长祝贺我们说：“你们将是人类灵魂工程师，国家将把自己的希望和未来都完全嘱托给你们。”啊，国家和人民把自己的未来和希望都付托给我们，这是多么巨大的责任，这是多么崇高的荣誉啊！然而，我知道：人不可能在一个早晨就取得一生的荣誉，必须用顽强艰苦的劳动斗争才能争取到。华尔华娜不就是付出了这样的代价吗？因此我意识到，在我面前摆着的将是一条光荣而又艰难的道路。
    首先，教师担当了一个十分重大的任务：培养新人。教师要造就社会主义和共产主义的新人，要使这些新人将来担当起建设共产主义的重任。教师的责任既然如此重大，教师的工作就有着很多的困难。教师应该不断地提高自己的思想，应该不断地从人民生活中，从科学艺术中吸取一切有用的东西。否则社会在前进，教师如果停滞不前，如何谈得上去培养社会的新人呢？因此，每当我清晨醒来，第一个念头是：努力学习吧，孩子正伸手向我们索取知识呢；学习中如果碰到困难，只要一想起无数伸向我们的小手，就有了克服困难的勇气；晚上就寝前，也常常检查自己：今天为孩子学了多少？是啊！为了孩子，为了祖国，一个教师一生都应该坚持不懈地学习。
    但是，更重要的，教师应该有极其高尚的品格。因为教育不仅是科学事业，而且是艺术事业，是一门教育人的艺术。教师负着影响学生心灵和道德的重大责任。加里宁说过：“老师的一举一动都处在最严格的监督下，世上任何人也没有受着这样严格的监督。”又说，“教师每天都仿佛蹲在一面镜子里，外面几百双精敏的、富于敏感的、即善于窥伺出教师优点和缺点的孩子眼睛，在不断地盯视着他。”是的，我们自己不也是这些严厉的监督者之一吗？我们喜欢模仿老师的一举一动，老师的一言一行更容易在我们身上烙下深刻的印象。
    因此当我第一次去中学实习时，我就十分注意自己的举动、言语，生怕带给学生任何不良的影响。当然，良好的品格，并非一朝一夕能够形成，它必须在日常生活中经常严格要求自己，注意每一微小的行为。俗语说：播种行为，收获习惯，播种习惯，收获性格。教师就应该重视在日常生活中培养自己良好的行为和习惯。
    说到这里，也许有人觉得当教师太困难了。是的，当教师，当一个好教师确实不是容易的事。但是，我们知道，在生活中，有趣的正是困难的事，而不是容易的事。比如在算一道代数题时，如果不需要费什么脑筋，一下子就算出来的话，一定会觉得太乏味。可是如果碰到一道难题，费尽九牛二虎之力才算出来，那时会怎样呢？一定会高兴地喊起来：“真有味，这样的题目真有味！”教师工作也就是这样困难有味的。
    记得去年我参加教学实习时，第一次给学生上语文课，讲“永不掉队”。为了讲好这一课，我曾花了多少时间和精力啊，连梦里都在背诵讲稿。课后，我与学生一起在装配间劳动，忽然听到两个学生在争吵：
    “不，你这是在敷衍塞责！”
    “算了，差一点，有谁看得出？”
    “一定得拆掉重装！我要在祖国面前对你负责！”
    “……。”
    沉默了，接着一阵拆装机件的声音。我高兴得几乎掉下泪来，想不到课上讲的高洛沃依和葛洛巴在祖国面前互相负责的故事，很快在学生身上产生影响了。是的，“永不掉队”四个字，将在他们毕生生活中烙上深刻的印象。教师的劳动丝毫没有白费。
    那次实习只有短短二十天，我已体会了教师工作的艰巨和教师责任的重大。不，我更深切体会的是教师的幸福。
    再过一个多月就要毕业了，马上要正式从事我理想的事业了。那时，我将负起更重大的责任，会碰到更多的困难，同时也会获得更多的幸福。真的，我感到世上没有比培养人更幸福的工作了。当人们回忆起学生时代美好的时光时，谁能不同时想到敬爱的老师吗？教师的幸福在这里，教师的光荣也在这里，教师就是这样一个光辉而又诱人的工作。
