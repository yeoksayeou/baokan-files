Xinhua News Agency, June 27th, Johannesburg Dispatch: South African people lit bonfires on the night of the 26th to commemorate South Africa's "Freedom Day." The African National Congress of South Africa called on the entire nation to protest the government's racial discrimination policies to commemorate this day.

    In Durban, Africans held a mass rally of about 20,000 people, starting a movement to boycott the products of companies and enterprises controlled by the ruling National Party of the South African Federation. Participants in the rally held torches high. Some leaders of the African National Congress delivered speeches at the rally. A large number of police officers stood guard nearby. On the streets, groups of Africans shouted slogans of freedom and sang loudly.

    While the rally was being held, in Cato Manor, an African area in the city where large-scale demonstrations against racial oppression had recently erupted, Africans lit bonfires everywhere to commemorate "Freedom Day."

    In the Langa African area near Cape Town in the southern part of the Federation, Africans also lit bonfires to commemorate "Freedom Day."

    In the capital, Pretoria, the situation was tense that night. Police mobile units patrolled African areas such as Marabastad and questioned Africans at bus stations and in front of cinemas.

    In Port Elizabeth, Africans continued to boycott white-owned shops until late on the 26th. South African "Freedom Day" is the fourth anniversary of the signing of the South African "Freedom Charter."
