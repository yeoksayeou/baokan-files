Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, June 27th: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's over six million mu of early corn are maturing successively, and tens of thousands of commune members are rushing to harvest in the rain. Various localities are leveraging the superiority of the people's communes to organize forces to support disaster-stricken areas in harvesting early corn.

In the major corn-producing counties of Guangxi, such as Du'an, Mashan, Xincheng, and Laibin, more than 150,000 people are mobilized daily to rush-harvest and transport early corn along both banks of the Hongshui River. In the Longwan People's Commune of Du'an Yao Autonomous County, over 3,000 mu of corn were flooded. The entire commune immediately organized 580 people from unaffected areas to support the rush harvest. Eight production teams in the Xinmin Brigade had their corn affected by flooding. The nine nearby production teams voluntarily organized more than 100 people, traveled by bamboo raft to provide support, and promptly harvested the corn from the disaster area. Mashan County deployed its strongest labor force to the forefront of the rush harvest, arranged for weaker laborers to dry and shell at home, or organized women to pick and men to transport. In just a few days, they rushed to harvest over 39,000 mu of early corn. By the 20th, the entire autonomous region had already rushed to harvest more than 420,000 mu of corn.

Corn is one of the main summer harvest grain crops in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Just as the corn was being harvested, it encountered continuous heavy rain, and many cornfields were flooded. To prevent the already mature crops from being lost, various localities strengthened organizational leadership during the rush harvest. Each county established a summer harvest command, and each commune established a summer harvest command post, led by the Party Committee Secretary, with a large number of cadres going to the fields to help the masses organize the rush harvest. After receiving a heavy rain forecast from the meteorological station, the five county Party committee secretaries of Du'an Yao Autonomous County personally led more than 80 people to six severely affected communes, and rushed to harvest corn with the commune members. The government offices and schools in the county seat also mobilized more than 7,000 people to assist nearby people's communes with the rush harvest. The Party Committee Secretary of Sanshi People's Commune in Donglan County went to the fields to harvest, transport, weigh, and inspect corn with the commune members, and helped the production team establish accounts, so that the amount of corn harvested was clear. The commune members were very satisfied.

While rushing to harvest, various localities adopted various measures to strengthen management, so that the harvested corn would not mold or sprout. More than 30,000 summer harvest workers in Laibin County rushed to harvest during the day and shelled at night. The people's communes and production brigades adopted methods such as assigning dedicated personnel to manage, dry, and bake, striving to achieve fast harvesting and good management. The Luochun Brigade of the Qipai People's Commune used 165 kang rooms to dry more than 150,000 jin of corn cobs in three days.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 27th: The areas in Wuhan City and Xiaogan and Huanggang Special Zones that were affected by heavy rain have, after more than half a month of hard work by the broad masses, completely drained the floodwater from the fields. After washing and supporting the seedlings, the submerged crops are becoming increasingly robust. Some fields where seedlings died due to submersion have been replanted with summer crops.

Wuhan City and more than ten counties, including Hanchuan, Huangpi, Huanggang, and Xishui, experienced continuous heavy rain from the evening of June 8th to the morning of June 9th, with rainfall of 200 to 300 millimeters. Many cotton fields, rice paddies, autumn miscellaneous grains, and vegetable gardens were flooded and submerged. Some factories, warehouses, and residential houses in low-lying areas of Wuhan City were also flooded. After the heavy rain, the broad masses of peasants and workers, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, actively launched a struggle to drain the water and combat the disaster.

In Xiaogan Special Zone, 1.2 million mu of farmland was flooded. After the heroic struggle of millions of people in the disaster-stricken areas, more than 76% of the seedlings have now been rescued. The preserved seedlings are showing a green color. The remaining parts have also been planted with late rice, soybeans, sesame, and other crops. Encouraged by the successive victories in the disaster relief struggle, the peasants of the entire special zone have also expanded the summer planting area by hundreds of thousands of mu compared with the original plan. Huangpi County, which was severely affected by the disaster, mobilized more than 100,000 people and 15,000 cadres after the heavy rain to combat the disaster and protect the seedlings. They set up tents in the fields, dug ditches day and night to drain water, rescued more than 80,000 mu of seedlings, filled in more than 28,000 depressions formed by water erosion in the fields, and replanted the washed-away seedlings.

In Huanggang Special Zone, 1 million mu of farmland was waterlogged, and about 900,000 mu have been rescued after half a month of hard work. More than 60,000 mu of severely affected land have been replanted with other crops.

The vegetable gardens and some grain fields planted in the suburbs of Wuhan City and the state-owned Dongxi Farm were also waterlogged by more than 110,000 mu, including more than 40,000 mu of vegetable gardens. After the strenuous rescue efforts of more than 40,000 people, and with the state mobilizing pumps to participate in draining the water, most of the vegetable gardens and grain fields have had the water drained, and most of the submerged vegetables have been rescued. Those that could not be saved were replanted in time with fast-maturing vegetables. After the water was drained from some flooded factories and enterprises in the urban area, production has returned to normal.

    不让成熟庄稼遭受损失
    广西各地冒雨抢收早玉米
    武汉市、孝感、黄冈专区受灾地区渍水全部排出
    新华社南宁27日电　广西僮族自治区六百多万亩早玉米相继成熟，成千上万的社员正在冒雨抢收。各地发挥人民公社的优越性，组织力量支援受灾地区抢收早玉米。
    广西玉米主要产区都安、马山、忻城、来宾等县，每天都出动十五万多人，在红水河两岸抢收抢运早玉米。都安瑶族自治县龙湾人民公社有三千多亩玉米受到水淹，全社立即组织未受水灾地区的五百八十多人前往支援抢收。新民大队有八个生产队的玉米受了水灾，附近的九个生产队自动组织一百多人，搭竹排前往支援，及时把受灾的玉米收了回来。马山县把强劳动力开到抢收第一线，弱劳动力安排在家晾晒、脱粒，或者组织妇女收摘，男人运输，不几天就抢收了三万九千多亩早玉米。到20日止，全自治区已经抢收玉米四十二万多亩。
    玉米是广西僮族自治区主要夏收粮食作物之一。正当玉米收摘时节，遇到了连日大雨，许多玉米地受到洪水侵袭。为了不让已经成熟的庄稼遭到损失，各地在抢收中普遍加强了组织领导。各县成立夏收指挥部，公社成立夏收指挥所，由党委书记挂帅，大批干部下田帮助群众组织抢收。都安瑶族自治县当接到气象台的大雨预告后，五个县委书记都亲自出马，带领八十多人分赴六个灾情较重的公社，同社员群众一起抢收玉米；县城里的机关、学校也出动七千多人到附近人民公社协助抢收。东兰县三石人民公社党委书记到田间同社员一起收玉米、运玉米、过秤、验收，并且帮助生产队建立账簿，使得已收的玉米数目一清二楚，社员都很满意。
    各地在抢收同时，采取各种措施加强管理，不使已收的玉米霉烂、发芽。来宾县三万多名夏收群众，白天抢收，晚上脱粒。各人民公社、生产大队采取固定专人管理、晾晒、烘干等办法，力求做到收的快，管的好。七排人民公社洛春大队用一百六十五个炕房，三天之内就烘干十五万多斤玉米苞。
    新华社武汉27日电　武汉市和孝感、黄冈专区因暴雨受灾的地区，经过广大群众半个多月的奋战，田地里的渍水已经全部排出。被淹庄稼经过洗苗扶苗以后，日趋茁壮，一部分淹死青苗的田地，已改种了夏种作物。
    武汉市和汉川、黄陂、黄冈、浠水等十多个县，从6月8日傍晚到9日清晨连下暴雨，降雨量二百到三百公厘。许多棉田、水稻、秋杂粮和菜园遭到了渍涝和淹没。武汉市区地处低洼的一些工厂厂房、仓库和居民房屋也遭水淹。暴雨过后，广大农民和职工在各级党委的领导下，积极展开了排渍抗灾的斗争。
    孝感专区被淹的一百二十万亩农田，经过受灾区百万群众的英勇奋战，现在76％以上的禾苗已经抢救出来，被保住的禾苗已呈一片青绿；其余部分也分别种了一季晚稻、黄豆、芝麻等作物。在抗灾斗争节节胜利的鼓舞下，全专区农民还比原来计划扩大了夏种面积几十万亩。受灾严重的黄陂县，大雨后出动十万多群众和一万五千名干部，进行抗灾保苗。他们在田间搭起帐篷，日夜挖沟排水，救出青苗八万多亩，填平田间被水冲成的凹壋两万八千多个，并补栽了被冲毁的禾苗。
    黄冈专区受渍农田达一百万亩，经半个月苦战，已救出九十万亩左右。受重灾的田地，有六万多亩已改种其他作物。
    武汉市郊区和国营东西农场种的蔬菜和部分粮田，也被渍十一万多亩，其中有四万多亩菜园。经过四万多人奋力抢救，国家又抽调抽水机参加排渍水，现在绝大部分菜园、粮田渍水已经排出，被淹蔬菜大都救活，部分救不活的也及时改种了快熟蔬菜。市区被淹的一些工厂企业渍水排出后，生产已经恢复正常。
