    South Africa Erupts in Anti-Apartheid Demonstration
    40,000 Africans in Durban Bravely Resist Police Suppression
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Durban News: On the 18th, in Durban, a port city of 500,000 residents on the east coast of the South African Federation, a large-scale demonstration of 40,000 Africans broke out in protest against white racial discrimination and persecution. Demonstrators bravely resisted the armed police who came to brutally suppress them.
    According to reports, on that day, initially about three thousand African women held a demonstration in front of a municipal beer hall in the Cato Manor district (an African slum) of the city, protesting the police authorities' violation of regulations that allow Africans to brew beer in their own homes. On the 17th, they illegally closed 26 African-owned beer halls and illegally arrested customers drinking beer in African beer halls.
    Subsequently, the white government sent a large number of armed police, using batons and tear gas to suppress these unarmed African women. When the demonstrators were forced to resist with stones, the police opened fire on them, killing three Africans and injuring more than thirty others.
    The bloody suppression by the white police angered the local African men and women, who had always suffered humiliation and persecution under the policy of racial discrimination. They immediately joined the women's demonstration, braving police bullets to resist, and smashed some municipal buildings and some buses. There are reports that Africans have also controlled access to the area.
    The white authorities panicked and hastily transferred a large number of military police from Johannesburg and other places to suppress the demonstrators. There are reports that a batch of reinforced police equipped with armored vehicles have entered Durban.
    Local African public opinion pointed out that the South African Federation's white government, which has always implemented a policy of racial segregation, illegally prohibited African women from making their own beer this time in an attempt to cut off their livelihoods and drive them to the so-called African "reservations." After the incident, Mabushida, the acting chairman of the Natal region of the South African African National Congress, issued a statement on the evening of the 18th, pointing out that "It is very clear that the people are angered by the (white government's) so-called policy and means of clearing the Cato Manor slums." He also pointed out that the incident in Cato Manor should be blamed on the Durban City Council and the African Administration and Development Bureau, an agency belonging to the white government.
    Mabushida also criticized the white government's racial discrimination policy, saying, "Residents who have lived in Durban for many years are being brutally expelled because they cannot provide the authorities with some kind of acceptable proof. The police are constantly attacking them for identification cards." "Sometimes without proper notice, homes for which people have invested money are being destroyed."
    The statement finally demanded that the white government immediately stop destroying African homes and expelling them in Cato Manor, and investigate the terrible living conditions of those African laborers driven by the whites. (Attached picture)

### 南非爆发反种族迫害大示威  德班港四万非洲人英勇反抗警察镇压

    南非爆发反种族迫害大示威
    德班港四万非洲人英勇反抗警察镇压
    新华社19日讯　德班消息：在南非联邦东海岸的拥有五十万居民的德班港，18日爆发了有四万非洲人参加的反抗白人种族歧视和迫害的大规模示威。示威者英勇反抗了赶来残暴镇压他们的武装警察。
    据报道，当天，最初有大约三千名非洲妇女在这个城市的卡托马诺尔区（非洲贫民区）的一家市政府开设的啤酒店门前举行示威，抗议警察当局违反准许非洲人在自己家里酿造啤酒的条例，在17日非法关闭二十六家非洲人开设的啤酒店，同时逮捕了到非洲人啤酒店中喝啤酒的顾客的非法行为。
    随后，白人政府派来大批武装警察，使用警棍和催泪弹来镇压这些手无寸铁的非洲妇女。当示威者被迫用石头进行反抗时，警察就向她们开了枪，结果打死三名非洲人，另外有三十多名非洲人受了伤。
    白人警察的血腥镇压激怒了一贯在种族歧视政策下遭受屈辱和迫害的当地非洲男女，他们立即参加了妇女的示威，冒着警察的枪弹进行反抗，并且捣毁了市政府的一些建筑物和一些公共汽车。有消息说，非洲人还控制了进入这个地区的通道。
    白人当局着了慌，急忙从约翰内斯堡等地增调大批军警赶来镇压示威者。有消息说，已经有一批配备有装甲车的增援警察开进了德班市。
    当地非洲人舆论指出，一贯执行种族隔离政策的南非联邦白人政府这次非法禁止非洲妇女自制啤酒，是企图断绝她们的生计而把她们赶到所谓非洲人“居留地”去。这次事件发生以后，南非非洲人国民大会纳塔尔地区代理主席马布希达18日晚上发表声明指出，“事情很清楚，人民是被（白人政府）的所谓清除卡托马诺尔贫民窟的政策和手段所激怒。”他还指出，这次在卡托马诺尔发生的事件应该归罪于德班市议会以及白人政府所属的机构——非洲人行政和开发局。
    马布希达还指责白人政府的种族歧视政策说，“在德班居住了多年的居民由于他们不能向当局提供某种可以被接受的证明而正在被粗暴地驱逐出去。警察为了身分证不断向他们进行袭击。”“有时没有适当的通知，人们曾经为之投下了金钱的家园正在遭到破坏。”
    声明最后要求白人政府立即停止在卡托马诺尔的破坏非洲人的家园和驱逐他们的行为，并且对那些受白人驱使的非洲劳工的可怕的生活条件进行调查。（附图片）
