Harvest, Transport, and Stack Simultaneously
Pucheng County Summarizes Mass Experience to Solve the Disconnect Between Harvesting and Transporting Wheat

Our newspaper's Xi'an dispatch on the 9th: Pucheng County, Shaanxi, promptly resolved the imbalance between transportation and harvesting during the summer harvest, ensuring meticulous harvesting and threshing of wheat, and that every grain is brought home.

Pucheng County is located in the Weibei dry plateau of Shaanxi, where wheat grows very well. In previous years, a cart could haul the yield of three or four mu at a time, but this year it can only haul a little more than one mu. Because the harvest volume has increased, and coupled with the rainy weather during this year's wheat harvest season, the cut wheat cannot be transported back in a timely manner. Generally, only one-third to one-half of the cut wheat is transported back on the same day. However, according to weather forecasts, there may be continuous rain in the area recently. Therefore, it is very important to quickly transport the wheat back and stack the ears of wheat to avoid scattering.

Xi Huai, the First Secretary of the Pucheng County Party Committee, worked in the Fifth Team of the Chitou Production Brigade of the Dangmu Commune and found that this team did a good job in harvesting, transporting, and stacking. They assigned all the small carts made during the spring fertilizer accumulation to women and children; and implemented a system of contracting land plots, quantities, quality, time, and stacking. In this way, a small cart could haul back the wheat from about three mu of land in a day. After the Chitou Production Brigade promoted the experience of this team, the transportation capacity basically caught up with the harvesting progress.

According to the calculations of the County Party Committee, the southern area of the county (where wheat matures earlier and harvesting has begun) has a total of 670,000 mu of wheat and 120,000 laborers, which can be harvested in three days. If only relying on the existing 4,000-plus large carts there, and each cart can haul a maximum of ten times a day, hauling one mu each time, it would take 16 and a half days to transport everything. Transportation conditions lag far behind the harvesting requirements.

However, if these areas all adopt the practice of the Chitou Production Brigade, that is, put more than 40,000 small carts into transportation, then the wheat can be transported in four and a half days, catching up with the harvesting progress.

The County Party Committee immediately convened a telephone conference, demanding that all people's communes rearrange the labor force, mobilize all transportation tools to participate in the wheat harvest, and ensure timely transportation and proper stacking. Many communes and production teams also used the following good methods: First, in addition to mobilizing all transportation tools, they also implemented changing people and animals without changing carts, giving full play to the potential of transportation tools. Second, temporary threshing grounds were set up in the fields, one for each production team on average, which shortened the transportation distance, saved transportation time, and also avoided scattering and loss. Third, three teams were organized for harvesting, transportation, and stacking, implementing daytime rush harvesting and nighttime rush transportation; long-distance transportation by carts and short-distance carrying by people; people do not return empty-handed, taking a rope when going to the fields and a bundle of wheat when returning; assigning the transportation of land plots, quantities, quality, and time to specific people and carts, implementing work point recording within the quota and cash payment for exceeding the quota. In order to ensure that every stalk and ear reaches the threshing ground, some teams also established a system of chain supervision, stipulating that: those who pull the rake (i.e., use the rake to collect the scattered wheat stalks on the ground) supervise those who harvest the wheat; those who transport supervise those who pull the rake; the head of the wheat stack supervises the transportation and stacking. After adopting the above methods, the wheat harvested on the same day in Pucheng County is generally transported back and stacked. For example, on June 2, Hanjing Commune mobilized 14,424 people to carry out harvesting, transportation, and stacking simultaneously, and transported all the 3,374 mu of wheat harvested on that day, and also transported more than 1,000 mu of wheat that had not been transported the day before to the threshing ground. The Dangmu Commune originally transported less than half of the wheat harvested each day, but after adopting these methods, it transported more than 19,000 mu of the 20,000 mu of wheat harvested each day. Many production teams ensured that there were no scattered or lost wheat stalks on the ground, roads, and around the wheat stacks.

### 边割麦  边运送  边堆好  蒲城县总结群众经验解决运麦割麦脱节现象

    边割麦  边运送  边堆好
    蒲城县总结群众经验解决运麦割麦脱节现象
    本报西安9日电　陕西蒲城县在夏收中及时解决了运输和收割不平衡的问题，保证了小麦细收细打，颗粒归仓。
    蒲城县位于陕西渭北旱原，小麦生长很好。往年一车一次能拉三、四亩，今年只能拉一亩稍多一点。因为收获量加大，又加上今年麦收期多雨，割倒的小麦不能及时全部运回，一般当天运回的只占割倒的三分之一到二分之一。但据气象预报，当地最近可能还有连阴雨。因此，赶紧把麦子抢运回来，把麦穗堆积好，避免抛撒，便是十分重要的工作。
    蒲城县委第一书记席槐，在党睦公社池头生产队第五小队工作，发现这个队收割、运输、堆积都搞得比较好。他们把春季积肥时制造的小车，全部交给妇女、儿童使用起来；并实行了包地块、包数量、包质量、包时间和包堆积，这样一个小车一天就可以拉回大约三亩地的小麦。池头生产队推广这个小队经验后，运输力量也基本上赶上了收割的进度。
    按照县委的计算，这个县南部地区（麦熟较早，已开始收割）共有六十七万亩小麦，十二万个劳动力，三天即可割完。要是只靠那里现有的四千多辆大车拉运，一个车一天最多拉十次，一次拉一亩，就需要拉十六天半才能拉运完。运输条件大大落后于收割要求。
    但是这些地区如果都采用池头生产队的作法，即把四万多辆小车投入拉运，那么四天半即可把麦运完，赶上收割的进度。
    县委立即召开电话会议，要求各人民公社重新安排好劳动力，动员所有的运输工具投入麦收，保证及时运回、堆好。不少公社和生产队又使用了以下这些好办法：一、除动员所有运输工具外，还实行换人、换畜不换车，发挥了运输工具的潜力。二、在地头设置临时场面，每个生产小队平均一个，既缩短了运输距离，节省了运输时间，还避免了抛撒丢失。三、按收割、运输、堆积三方面的工作，组织了三套人马，实行白天突击割麦，晚上突击运输；远地车运，近地人背；人不空回，上地一条绳，回来一捆麦；把运输的地块、数量、质量、时间落实到人到车，实行定额以内的记工分和超额的付现金。为了确保株穗到场，有些队还定出连环督促制度，规定：拉耙的（即用耙来拉收散落在地上的麦株的）督促割麦的；拉运的督促拉耙的；麦堆场长督促拉运、堆积的。采用上述办法以后，目前蒲城县各公社当日割下的小麦，一般都可以运回和堆好。如罕井公社6月2日出动了一万四千四百二十四人，收割、拉运、堆积同时进行，当天把收割了的三千三百七十四亩小麦全部拉完，还把先一天未拉回的一千多亩小麦也拉到麦场。党睦公社原来一天割倒的拉运不到一半，采取这些办法后，一天收割的二万多亩小麦，拉回的就有一万九千多亩。许多生产队做到了地面、道路以及麦堆四周，没有散乱丢失的麦株。
