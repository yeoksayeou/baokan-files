Xinhua News Agency, May 31st: Over 20,000 children in the capital held a garden party in Zhongshan Park today to celebrate International Children's Day.

Beautiful Zhongshan Park became a world of joy for children tonight. Thousands of colored lights shone brightly among the ancient cypresses; children sang and danced with abandon everywhere in the park.

A little chairman announced the start of the evening party. Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, congratulated the children on the holiday and extended a warm welcome to the foreign children present. In his congratulatory speech, he hoped that the children would study hard, love labor, respect working people, and exercise well to be honest, upright, and courageous good children. Wu Han finally exhorted the children to always listen to the Party, listen to Chairman Mao, strive for progress every day, and aspire to be outstanding successors with socialist consciousness, culture, and a love for labor in the construction of communism.

After the evening party began, in front of the colorfully decorated Zhongshan Hall, on the Altar of Land and Grain, in the West Grove, and along the Houhe River, joyful children danced and sang at the top of their lungs. Many art troupes came specially to perform wonderful shows for them.

The parents of many revolutionary martyrs, whom the children admired, also came, bringing greater encouragement to the joyful children in the park. Wherever these elderly people went, there was extra jubilation. Huang Jiguang's mother, Deng Fangzhi, and Yang Liandi's father, Yang Yupou, walked into the children's dance circle and were immediately surrounded, with shouts of "Hello, Mother Huang!" and "Hello, Grandpa Yang!" all around. Tu Hailin, a Young Pioneer from Xisi Central Elementary School, threw himself into Mother Huang's arms and asked her to tell the story of martyr Huang Jiguang. Mother Huang stroked the child and said, "Your brother Huang Jiguang was very brave, listened to the Party, and was not proud. You must learn from Huang Jiguang's excellent qualities." Luo Shengjiao's father, Luo Diekai, and the mother of soldiers, Rong Guanxiu, visited the children everywhere to extend holiday greetings. When they arrived at the Laijin Yuxuan gathering area, the children all crowded around them to greet them. Chaoyangmen Elementary School specially performed the Tibetan dance "Happy Children" for them. Song Xueyi, one of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain, Li Laicai, the legless tractor driver, as well as some veteran Red Army soldiers and model disabled soldiers also came to celebrate with the children.

Many foreign children in Beijing were also invited to participate in the evening party. They celebrated their own holiday with the Chinese children. A group of Soviet children saw the students from the Beijing Dance School who had just finished performing the Tibetan dance and ran over to shake hands enthusiastically. One Soviet child even said in Chinese, "Hello!" A group of Young Pioneers from the German Democratic Republic, wearing blue scarves, were particularly excited to see Liu Hulan's mother, Hu Wenxiu. They jumped and laughed around Hu Wenxiu and took pictures together. These German children had visited Liu Hulan's hometown and were already familiar with Hu Wenxiu. Groups of children from Romania, Czechoslovakia, and other countries played happily in the game area. Some children from India and Burma played various games with the Chinese children. More than twenty Indonesian children participated in the beanbag toss game and received prizes.

Vice Premiers of the State Council Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Huang Kecheng, Chairperson of the All-China Women's Federation Cai Chang, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Fan Rusheng, Deputy Mayors of Beijing Cheng Hongyi and Jia Tingsan, as well as responsible comrades from many departments of the Central Government and Beijing Municipality, spent this wonderful evening with the children.

Personnel from the industrial delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Zheng Yilong, and many other foreign guests in Beijing were also invited to participate in the children's evening party.

As the children's carnival reached its climax, festive fireworks suddenly soared into the night sky. Thousands of children's smiling faces looked up at these sparks symbolizing childhood happiness, everyone cheered, and everyone rejoiced.

    首都两万小朋友游园联欢
    新华社31日讯　首都两万多名少年儿童今天在中山公园举行游园晚会，庆祝“六一”国际儿童节。
    美丽的中山公园今晚成了孩子们欢乐的世界。古柏丛里，万盏彩灯齐明；园内各处，孩子们纵情歌舞。
    小主席宣布晚会开始。北京市副市长吴晗向孩子们祝贺节日，向到会的外国小朋友表示热烈欢迎。他在祝词中希望孩子们用功读书、热爱劳动、尊敬劳动人民、锻炼好身体，做一个诚实、正直、勇敢的好孩子。吴晗最后嘱咐孩子们要永远的听党的话，听毛主席的话，天天向上，立志做一个有社会主义觉悟的、有文化、爱劳动的建设共产主义的优秀接班人。
    晚会开始后，在打扮得五彩缤纷的中山堂前、社稷坛上、西树林里、后河沿旁，欢乐的孩子们到处翩翩起舞，放声歌唱。许多艺术团体特地来为他们作精彩的演出。
    孩子们敬仰的许多革命烈士的父母也来了，给满园欢乐的孩子带来了更大的鼓舞。这些老人走到哪里，哪里就格外欢腾。黄继光的妈妈邓芳芝和杨连第的父亲杨玉璞走到孩子的舞圈里，立即被包围起来，四周响起了：“黄妈妈好”“杨爷爷好”的问候声。西四中心小学的少先队员屠海林扑在黄妈妈的怀里，要求妈妈讲讲黄继光烈士的故事。黄妈妈抚摸着孩子说：“你的黄继光哥哥很勇敢，听党的话，并且不骄傲，你要学习黄继光哥哥的优秀品质。”罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开和子弟兵母亲戎冠秀等到各处看望孩子们，向孩子祝贺节日。当他们来到来今雨轩联欢区时，孩子们一齐围拢上来向他们问好。朝阳门小学特地为他们演出了藏族舞蹈“欢乐儿童”。狼牙山五壮士之一的宋学义、无脚拖拉机手李来财以及一些红军老干部、模范残废军人也来和孩子们一起联欢。
    在北京的许多外国小朋友也应邀参加了晚会，他们和中国小朋友在一起欢庆自己的节日。一群苏联小朋友见到刚刚演完藏族舞蹈的北京舞蹈学校学生，跑上前去热情地握手。有个苏联小朋友还用中国话说：“你好！”一群系着蓝领巾的德意志民主共和国少先队员见到刘胡兰的母亲胡文秀格外兴奋，他们围着胡文秀又跳又笑，还一起照了像。这些德国小朋友曾到刘胡兰家乡访问过，早就和胡文秀熟悉了。成群结队的罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克等国小朋友在游戏区尽兴地游玩。印度、缅甸的一些小朋友和中国小朋友一起做各种游戏。二十多个印度尼西亚的小朋友参加了投沙袋的游戏，还得到了奖品。
    国务院副总理李富春、李先念，中国人民解放军总参谋长黄克诚，中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅，中共北京市委书记处书记范儒生，北京市副市长程宏毅、贾庭三，以及中央和北京市许多部门的负责同志，和孩子们一起欢度这个美好的夜晚。
    以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相郑一龙为首的工业参观团人员和在京的许多其他国家的外宾，也应邀参加了孩子们的晚会。
    当孩子狂欢歌舞达到高潮的时候，节日的焰火突然腾上夜空。千万个孩子的笑脸仰望着这些象征童年幸福的火花，人人欢呼，个个雀跃。
