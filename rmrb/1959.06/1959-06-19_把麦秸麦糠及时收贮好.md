    Promptly Collect and Store Wheat Straw and Wheat Bran
    It is very important to promptly collect and store wheat straw and wheat bran while threshing wheat, to be used as feed for draft animals.
    As everyone knows, the Qinchuan cattle of Shaanxi Province, the Jinnan cattle of Shanxi Province, and the Nanyang cattle of Henan Province are all fine breeds of large-sized bulls in our country. Their main feed is wheat straw. This fully illustrates that wheat straw can not only feed cattle but also feed them well.
    Wheat straw and wheat bran contain certain nutrients; two catties of wheat straw are equivalent to one catty of millet stalk. However, the sown area of wheat is much larger than that of millet. It is much more economical for wheat-producing areas to collect and utilize wheat straw locally than to spend money on buying feed from other places. Therefore, areas with insufficient feed and the habit of feeding livestock with wheat straw, etc., should naturally collect and store it well; areas without the feeding habit should also collect and store it well for trial use.
    This year, during the wheat harvest season, there has been more rain in some areas. Wheat straw and wheat bran are prone to mold after being exposed to rain, so they must be collected and stored promptly. We must not only "seize grain from the tiger's mouth" but also "compete for grass from the tiger's mouth."
    The collection and storage of wheat straw and wheat bran should be carried out simultaneously with wheat threshing. Wheat bran should be placed indoors to prevent rain. Wheat straw should be stacked, with appropriate distances between stacks to prevent fire. For those that have already been rained on, they should be spread out to dry and then stored.
    Wheat bran can be used to feed livestock in summer. It is best to wash it with clean water beforehand to remove dust and soften it, making it more palatable for livestock. Wheat straw can be saved for feeding in the autumn. In addition to chopping it short, wheat straw should also be treated with lime alkalization. Lime alkalized wheat straw has three benefits: first, it can improve its digestibility; second, alkalized wheat straw becomes soft, which can allow draft animals to eat 20%—45% more; third, it can prevent horses, mules, and donkeys from suffering from colic caused by eating wheat straw. The above suggestions are for your reference. Yang Jinshan

### 把麦秸麦糠及时收贮好

    把麦秸麦糠及时收贮好
    在小麦脱粒的同时，及时把麦秸、麦糠收贮起来，作为耕畜饲草，是一件十分重要的事情。
    大家知道，陕西省的秦川牛、山西省的晋南牛、河南省的南阳牛，都是我国体型高大的良种公牛。它们的主要饲草是麦秸。这充分说明：麦秸不仅可以喂牛，还可以喂好。
    麦秸、麦糠含有一定的营养，二斤麦秸可顶一斤粟（小米）秸。可是，小麦的播种面积要比粟大得多，麦产区就地收贮和利用麦秸等，比花钱向外地买饲草要经济得多。因此，饲草不足又有用麦秸等喂牲口的习惯的地区，固然应当收贮好；没有喂用习惯的地区，也应当收贮好，以备试用。
    今年麦收季节，部分地区雨水较多，麦秸、麦糠受雨淋以后，容易发霉，必须及时收贮好。我们不仅要“龙口夺粮”，也要“龙口争草”。
    麦秸、麦糠的收贮工作，应当随着小麦脱粒同时进行。麦糠应放在屋内，以防雨淋。麦秸应堆成垛，垛与垛之间要有适当距离，以防火灾。对已经淋了雨的，应当摊开晒干，然后贮存。
    麦糠在夏季就可以喂牲口。最好事先用清水淘洗，除去尘土，并使它变软，牲口更加爱吃。麦秸可以留到秋后喂。麦秸的加工方法，除了铡短以外，还应进行石灰碱化处理。用石灰碱化的麦秸，有三个好处：第一、能提高它的消化率；第二、碱化后的麦秸变软，可以使耕畜多吃20％—45％；第三、可以防止马、骡、驴吃麦秸而引起疝痛。以上意见，供大家参考。　杨金三
