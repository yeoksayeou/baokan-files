    Weekend
    Sun Shikai
    The 13th was an ordinary weekend in Beijing. That evening, although the attendance rate of all theaters and cinemas was higher than usual, more audiences were in the parks. People who had completed a week of production or work, brought their elderly, loved ones, and children, and happily walked into their favorite parks. In the ancient cypress forests or open spaces, open-air stages were set up, and many professional troupes performed dramas, folk arts, shadow plays, or showed open-air movies here.
    Zhongshan Park is one of the most visited parks. In the expanded music hall, the actors participating in the Second Literary and Art Performance Conference of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed many excellent programs. A light song and dance performance by amateur literary and art workers from the army from Xinjiang, Guangzhou, and other places in Beijing, constantly won enthusiastic applause from the audience. Outside the Tannan Gate of this park, under the wisteria trellis was a crosstalk gathering, and in the cypress forest, hundreds of tourists formed a circle to watch Chinese magic tricks. Tianqiao veteran artists Jin Wanshun, Liu Enrong, and Tian Lianfu used their skillful hands to perform "Luoquan Offering Treasures" and "Cleverly Obtaining Chicken and Fish," which made the audiences laugh loudly. In the Western forest, decorated with lanterns and colorful lights, there was a light music tea house. Groups of people, facing the summer night breeze, sat on rattan chairs, drinking tea and enjoying the music. At the same time, the Labor Theater of the Palace of Culture for the Working People was bustling with gongs and drums, and actors Li Hezeng and Zhang Yunxi from the China Peking Opera Theatre performed the newly arranged Peking Opera "Picking Stars Tower." Some parks also had open-air dances.
    That evening, many lakes or moats in the parks were also places for tourists to enjoy themselves. Taoranting Park held a novel fireworks and lotus lantern party. When night fell, colorful fireworks rose from the earthen hill in the park, sometimes piercing the sky, sometimes appearing in front of people's eyes, causing a burst of jubilation among more than 30,000 tourists. Some employees brought their children to sit on the green grass on the banks of the East Lake to watch the fireworks in the water, which was particularly interesting. In the West Lake, thousands of red and green colored lotus lanterns were lit for tourists, drifting on the water with the wind, just like a pond of blooming lotus flowers, adding a lot of poetry to the weekend party. In Beihai Park, tourists boarded hundreds of yachts and rowed back and forth on the rippling water, and from time to time bursts of laughter came from the yachts. The largest garden party held in this park not long ago accommodated more than 70,000 tourists. (Attached picture)

    周末
    孙世恺
    13日是北京一个平常的周末。这一天傍晚，尽管所有的剧场、影院上座率都比平日高，但是更多的观众却在公园里。完成一周生产或工作任务的人们，带着老人、爱人和孩子，愉快地走进他们所喜欢的公园。在古老的松柏树林中或空地上，搭着露天舞台，许多专业剧团分别在这里演出戏剧、曲艺、皮影或放映露天电影。
    中山公园是游人最多的公园之一。在扩建后的音乐堂上，参加中国人民解放军第二届文艺会演大会的演员们演出了许多优秀节目，从新疆、广州等地来京的部队业余文艺工作者表演的一场轻歌漫舞，不断地博得观众狂热的掌声。在这个公园的坛南门外，紫萝藤架下是相声大会、柏树林中又有上百游人围成一圈观看中国戏法。天桥老艺人金万顺、刘恩荣和田连福运用巧妙的双手表演出“罗圈献彩”、“巧取鸡鱼”等节目，逗得里三层外三层的观众哄哄大笑。在西树林里张灯结彩的地方，又有轻音乐茶座，三五成群的人们，迎着夏夜的微风，坐在藤椅上一面喝茶，一面欣赏乐曲。在这同时，劳动人民文化宫的劳动剧场正锣鼓喧天，中国京剧院的演员李和曾、张云溪等演出了今年新排的京剧“摘星楼”。有的公园里还有露天舞会。
    这一天傍晚，许多公园里的湖泊或护城河上，也是游人欢乐的场所。陶然亭公园别开生面地举行了焰火荷灯晚会。当夜色降临时，从园内土山上升起五彩缤纷的焰火，忽而钻入天际，忽而出现在人们的眼前，引起三万多游人的一片欢腾。有些职工带着孩子坐在东湖岸边的绿草地上，观赏水中的焰火，别有一番趣味。在西湖里为游人燃放着上千盏红、绿彩色的荷灯，随风在水面上漂动，恰如一池盛开的荷花，给周末的晚会增添了不少诗意。在北海公园里，游人乘上几百只游艇在碧波荡漾的水面上游来划去，时而又从游艇上传出一阵阵的欢笑声。这个公园不久以前举行的最大一次游园会，容纳了七万多游人。（附图片）
