Zhenping's Six Measures for Protecting Young Forests

Last winter and this spring, the people of Zhenping County, Henan Province, achieved great success in planting trees and creating forests, afforesting 270,000 mu of land on a large scale, and planting a large number of trees "around the four sides" (houses, villages, roads, and waters). In order to consolidate the fruits of their labor in planting trees and creating forests, the people of the county have adopted six measures to protect young forests, ensuring that every tree planted survives, and every planted area becomes a forest. These six measures are: First, the trees along roadsides and near houses are painted white and red to avoid damage; for larger trees, protective frames are set up to prevent wind from shaking the roots; second, protection is divided by area, section, and tree according to the residential area, with signs hung on the trees and specific responsibility assigned to individuals; third, forest protection covenants are established, achieving "three no's" (no climbing, no shaking, no touching) and "three diligences" (diligent watering, diligent soil cultivation, diligent fertilization); fourth, protecting trees on both sides of highways and canals is regarded as one of the important tasks of road and canal maintenance; fifth, the young forests created since 1957 are subject to closing hillsides for afforestation, with signs erected around the forest area and forest protection covenants placed at intersections to educate grazing commune members and prohibit cattle and sheep from entering the young forest area; sixth, during the growing season of young trees, the soil is loosened and weeds are removed twice a year to achieve "two cleans" (clean of weeds, clean of stones) and "three non-injuries" (no injury to roots, bark, or terminal buds), and "three combinations" (combined with pressing green manure, fertilizing, and irrigating), and the soil around the young trees is loosened and the roots sealed during soil loosening.

    镇平保护幼林的六项措施
    去冬今春，河南镇平县人民，在植树造林方面取得很大成绩，大面积造林二十七万亩，并在“四旁”大量植树。全县人民为巩固植树造林的劳动成果，采取了六项措施保护幼林，保证作到栽一株、活一株，造一片、成林一片。这六项措施是：一，路边宅旁的树木，株株涂白抹红以免碰坏，对较大树木，为防止风吹摇动树根，设置保护架；二，根据居住地区，分片、分段、分株保护，实行树上挂牌，责任具体到人；三，订立护林公约，作到“三不”（不攀折、不摇动、不抚摸）、“三勤”（勤浇水、勤培土、勤施肥）；四，把保护公路渠道两旁的树木，作为护路养路、护渠养渠的重要工作之一；五，对1957年以来营造的幼林，实行封山育林，林地周围树立封山育林牌，在路口设护林爱林公约牌，教育放牧社员，禁止牛羊进入幼林地；六，在幼树生长季节，每年松土除草二次，作到“二净”（杂草净、石头净）、“三不伤”（不伤根、皮和顶芽）、“三结合”（结合压绿肥、施肥、灌溉），并在松土时作到幼树的周围松，树根封。
