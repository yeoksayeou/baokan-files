    On both banks of the Yellow River,
    Inside and outside the Great Wall,
    The wheat harvesting army has lined up its formation,
    As if facing a campaign,
    Men and horses rush from thousands of households.
    The scythes have been sharpened three times,
    Silver light radiates brilliantly,
    The shafts have long been harnessed,
    To carry loads of golden mountains.
    Mules and horses are anxious to prance and frolic,
    The reed parrotbill has already cried its feathers white,
    The harvesters are eager to break into a run,
    Roaring, they drive to the fields.
    The Party branch secretary, holding the red flag,
    Is so happy he swings his arms and opens his heart,
    The commune members walk and praise:
    "Let's see who harvests the cleanest and fastest!"

    在黄河两岸长城内外
    郭煌
    在黄河两岸，
    长城内外，
    麦收大军把阵势摆开，
    好像面临着征战，
    人马从千村万户中扑来。
    镰刀磨亮了三遍，
    一道道银光放异彩，
    车辕早就套好了，
    要把一座座金山驮载。
    骡马急得扬蹄撒欢，
    麦黄鸟已经把羽毛叫白，
    收割机等得撒开腿了，
    轰轰??向田里开。
    党支书撑着红旗，
    乐得直抡胳膊敞开怀，
    社员们边走边夸：
    “看谁收割得又净又快！”
