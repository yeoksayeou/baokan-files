    "Night Shift" and Health
    Fu Lianzhang
    In factories, hospitals, newspapers and other units, night shifts are unavoidable. Some people worry about whether working the night shift will affect their health. My answer is no. Many animals are nocturnal, like lions, who prefer to be active at night. If our bodies could be like lions, I think everyone would be satisfied.
    Perhaps some people disagree with comparing humans to animals, so let's analyze night shift work specifically!
    First, assuming that working the night shift and the day shift both involve eight hours of work and eight hours of sleep each day, with no difference, then the main differences between the two are only in: the change in work, sleep and meal times, the amount of exposure to sunlight, and the fact that day shifts mostly use natural lighting while night shifts use artificial lighting. However, these have no effect on the health of night shift workers if properly arranged.
    Attention should be paid to productive lighting. If the conditions are not good, it will not only damage eyesight, but also easily cause fatigue and reduce work efficiency. Natural lighting is somewhat superior to artificial lighting, but in terms of time or space, solar lighting also has shortcomings or unevenness. Therefore, some factories use artificial lighting or mixed lighting even during daytime work. The lighting sources in general factories are hygienically designed, so there is no need to worry.
    Exposure to sunlight is an indispensable factor in human life, because sunlight can keep human skin healthy and promote the production of vitamin D in the skin to ensure strong bones. The most important rays in sunlight for us are ultraviolet rays, but people who work indoors during the day also benefit little, because ultraviolet rays are blocked by the glass of the windows. Therefore, everyone should have a certain amount of outdoor activity every day to bask in the warm sunshine. Night shift workers can completely achieve this by engaging in one or two hours of outdoor activities during the day after getting enough sleep.
    Developing a regular lifestyle can be said to be the most important guarantee for the health of night shift workers. Regular sleep and regular meals can establish a kind of temporal conditioned reflex in the brain, so that people's nervous system and various organs can move with relaxation, tension, rhythm and regularity. This is undoubtedly most beneficial to health. For example, like people who work during the day, we eat a meal about every four hours, and we will be hungry when the time comes. Why are we hungry? Is it because the nutrients in the body have been completely consumed? No, there are still considerable reserves of nutrients in the body, and the feeling of hunger is a phenomenon of conditioned reflex. After four hours, the appetite center of the brain is excited, the blood sugar also drops a little, and the stomach and intestines begin to become active, thus forming a feeling of hunger. If you are not used to eating in the evening, you will not be hungry even after more than ten hours. The importance of regular sleep is the same. Therefore, night shift workers should arrange their lives well and develop a new temporal conditioned reflex pattern. Eat at a certain time, and you will be hungry when the time comes. A hungry person is easy to feed, and it tastes sweet when you eat it. Go to sleep at a certain time, and you will be sleepy when the time comes. A sleepy person is easy to sleep, and you will sleep soundly. If the opposite is true, and your life is chaotic, sleeping in the morning today and in the afternoon tomorrow, and eating sometimes full and sometimes hungry, sometimes early and sometimes late, then the new regular lifestyle cannot be formed, so that you cannot eat when you should eat, and you cannot sleep when you should sleep. This is of course detrimental to health, but it cannot be attributed to the badness of working the night shift, but only to the fact that your own life arrangement is too chaotic.
    In the old liberated areas, during the guerrilla war, we were almost always active at night. The 25,000-li Long March can also be said to be nearly two years of night marching. Many of the people who went through those hard years are now old, like Comrade Xu Teli, who is already over eighty years old. Moreover, at that time, it was impossible to consider some of the hygiene issues I mentioned above, but today there are many favorable conditions. Therefore, people who work the night shift today do not need to worry about whether they can be healthy and live a long life.
    On the other hand, it should also be admitted that working during the day has many good natural conditions. Working at night is a bit more strenuous, and it is unnecessary to arrange work that can be done during the day to be done at night. Especially for the elderly and weak, it is difficult to get a quiet rest during daytime sleep. Therefore, unless it is necessary for work, the main working hours should be arranged during the day.

    “夜班”与健康
    傅连暲
    在工厂、医院、报社等单位，都不免有夜班工作。有人耽心上夜班会不会影响健康。我的回答是否定的。有许多动物都是宵行昼伏，像狮子就是喜欢晚上活动的。如果说我们的身体能像狮子一样，我想大家该会满意的了。
    或许有人不同意把人比作动物的见解，那么就对夜班工作来一个具体分析吧！
    首先假定上夜班与上白班每天都是八小时工作、八小时睡眠而没有区别的话，则二者之间的区别主要就只在于：工作睡眠与进餐时间的改变，接触阳光机会的多少和上白班大多是自然照明而上夜班是人工照明等三个方面了。而这只需要妥善安排，对于夜班工作者是无损于健康的。
    生产性照明应该注意，条件不好时，不仅对视力有损，而且容易引起疲劳，减低工作效率。自然照明比人工照明多少要优越一点，但在时间上或空间上，太阳照明也有不足或不均匀的缺陷，所以有些工厂白昼工作也得人工照明或者混合照明。一般工厂的照明光源都是经过卫生设计的，可以不必顾虑。
    接触阳光，是人生活中不可缺少的因素，因为阳光能使人皮肤健康，能促进皮肤内丁种维生素的生成，以保证骨胳的强壮。阳光中对于我们最重要的光线是紫外线，但白昼在室内工作的人，由于紫外线为窗户的玻璃所遮断，也是受惠不多的。所以任何人每天都应该有一定的户外活动，来沐浴一下温暖的阳光。夜班工作者获得了充足的睡眠以后，在日间进行一两个小时的户外活动，是完全可以作得到的。
    养成生活习惯的规律性，可以说是保证夜班工作者身体健康的最重要的一条。定时睡眠，定时进餐，可以在大脑里建立起一种时间性的条件反射，从而使人的神经系统和各个器官有弛有张有节奏有规律地活动，这无疑最有利于健康。如像我们白昼工作的人，每天约隔四小时吃一顿饭，到了时候就会饿，为什么饿呢？是人体的营养品都消耗光了吗？不是的，营养品在体内还有相当的储备，而饥饿的感觉就是一种条件反射的现象。隔了四小时，大脑的食欲中枢就兴奋了，血糖也降低一点，胃肠也开始活跃起来，于是形成一种饥饿的感觉。晚间没有吃饭习惯，即使十几个小时也不会饿。定时睡眠的重要性也是同样的道理。所以夜班工作者，应该很好安排自己的生活，养成一种新的时间性条件反射规律。在一定的时间吃饭，到了时候就会饿，饥者易为食，吃起来就香甜，一定时间入睡，到了时候就会困，困者易睡，睡起来就安稳。如果与此相反，生活上杂乱无章，今天早晨睡，明天下午睡，吃饭又是饱一顿饿一顿，早一顿晚一顿，这就使新的生活规律性不能形成，以致该吃的时候吃不下，该睡的时候睡不着，这当然对健康不利，但它不能归咎于上夜班的不好，而只能说是自己的生活安排太乱了。
    从前在老解放区进行游击战争时，差不多都是晚上活动，二万五千里长征也可以说是将近两年的夜行军。经过那些艰苦岁月的人，现在很多都是老年了，像徐特立同志已经有八十多岁的高龄。况且那些时候根本无法考虑我上面提到的一些卫生问题，而今天却有许多有利条件。所以在今天从事夜班工作的人，完全不必顾虑能否健康长寿的问题了。
    另一面，也应该承认，白昼工作是有许多很好的自然条件。夜间工作是比较辛苦一点，把可以在白天做的工作安排在晚上是不必要的。特别是年老体弱的人，白昼睡眠难以得到安静的休息。所以大凡不是在工作必需的情况下，应该把主要工作时间安排在日间。
