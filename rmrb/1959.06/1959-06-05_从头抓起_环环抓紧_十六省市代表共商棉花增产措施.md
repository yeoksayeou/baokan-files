Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, June 4th: The level of cotton production directly depends on the number of cotton bolls that can be harvested. To strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year, the Ministry of Agriculture held a national cotton boll preservation conference in Shijiazhuang in late May, calling on all regions to improve field management and promote early boll setting, abundant mid-season boll setting, large boll setting, and good boll setting.

This year's cotton production is being carried out based on the rich experience of last year's Great Leap Forward in cotton production. The quality of sowing has been further improved, and the vast majority of cotton fields have good emergence and strong seedling growth. These are the foundations for striving for a bumper cotton harvest. The conference believes that on this basis, strengthening field management, doing a good job in protecting buds and bolls, promoting abundant pre-mid-season boll setting, ensuring mid-season bolls, and grasping late-season bolls to strive for more, larger, and better bolls has become the key to ensuring a bumper cotton harvest.

Based on last year's high-yield experience, the conference pointed out that abundant pre-mid-season boll setting can effectively advance and lengthen the boll-setting period, winning more time to set bolls. At the same time, pre-mid-season cotton plants are still small, with good ventilation and light transmission, and the shedding of cotton buds and bolls is less, so high-quality "early bloom" can be harvested. In order to promote abundant pre-mid-season boll setting, the conference requested that, while ensuring reasonable close planting and full emergence, timely early thinning, early setting of seedlings, early cultivation, and multiple cultivations should be carried out to increase soil temperature, promote seedling development, and inhibit seedling diseases. It is also necessary to strengthen the prevention and control of seedling pests, especially to thoroughly control aphids before and after wheat harvest, to promote normal cotton development, early budding, early flowering, and early boll setting.

The conference believes that ensuring mid-season bolls is the most important link in the potential for increasing cotton production. During the hot summer months, cotton flowers bloom the fastest and most abundantly, and the cotton bolls that set are also large, with good lint quality after maturity, commonly known by the masses as "mid-season bloom." However, this period is also when cotton buds and bolls shed the most. According to past years' situations, the buds and bolls in the middle and lower parts of cotton plants often shed 70% to 80%. Therefore, ensuring mid-season bolls has become a crucial key to ensuring high-yield cotton production. The conference pointed out that to prevent bud and boll shedding during the hot summer months, the main focus should be on regulating fertilizer, water, temperature (ventilation), and light (sunshine), and taking various measures to create a good growing environment for cotton.

The conference pointed out that grasping late-season bolls was an important experience in last year's bumper cotton harvest. This year, on the basis of ensuring mid-season bolls, late-season bolls should be vigorously grasped. The central issue in promoting abundant late-season boll setting is to strengthen late-stage field management: increase fertilizer application, and irrigate appropriately during drought. It is also possible to appropriately postpone topping according to the earliness of the frost period, and retain more fruit branches in order to set more late-season bolls. However, blindly retaining too many fruit branches or not topping the tips is also incorrect and should be prevented.

The conference believes that seedling management, abundant pre-mid-season boll setting, ensuring mid-season bolls, and grasping late-season bolls are interconnected. If one link, especially the first link, is not done well, the other links will be affected. Therefore, it is necessary to start from the beginning and tightly link each link. Currently, it is necessary to earnestly do a good job in checking and replanting seedlings, and do a good job in seedling management in order to achieve reasonable close planting and full and strong seedlings.

In order to do a good job in the above four stages of cotton field management and strive for a bumper cotton harvest, the conference called on all cotton-producing areas to immediately launch a large-scale high-yield competition movement. In the movement, leaders at all levels should not only focus on large-area high-yield fields, but also organize the broad masses to pay attention to the management of general fields, and combine extensive planting and high yield with less planting and high yield.

The conference was attended by the heads of agriculture departments and bureaus from sixteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Liaoning, and Shanghai, the heads of special and county agricultural bureaus in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province, and a number of cotton-planting models. During the conference, the representatives visited the cotton field management of the Liuying Production Team in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang. (Attached picture)

### 从头抓起　环环抓紧  十六省市代表共商棉花增产措施

    从头抓起　环环抓紧
    十六省市代表共商棉花增产措施
    据新华社石家庄4日电　棉花产量高低，直接取决于能收获的棉桃多少。为了力争今年棉花大丰收，5月下旬农业部在石家庄召开的全国棉花保桃会议，号召各地搞好田间管理，促使棉花早座桃，多座伏桃，座大桃，座好桃。
    今年的棉花生产，是在总结了去年棉花生产大跃进的丰富经验基础上进行的。播种质量有了进一步的提高，绝大部分棉田出苗良好，幼苗生长茁壮，这些都是争取棉花大丰收的基础。会议认为，在这个基础上，加强田间管理，做好保蕾保桃工作，促使棉花多座伏前桃，确保伏桃，抓好秋桃，力争桃多、桃大、桃好，就成了确保棉花大丰收的关键。
    根据去年的丰产经验，会议指出，多座伏前桃，能够有效地提早并加长结铃期，赢得多结桃的时间；同时伏前棉棵尚小，通风透光良好，棉蕾棉铃脱落的少，可以多收质量良好的“头喷花”。为了多座伏前桃，会议要求，在保证合理密植和全苗的条件下，要适时的早间苗，早定苗，早中耕，多中耕，以提高地温，促进幼苗发育，抑止苗期病害；还要加强防治苗期虫害，特别是麦收前后要彻底治蚜，以促使棉花正常发育，早现蕾、早开花和早座桃。
    会议认为，确保伏桃是棉花增产潜力最重要的一个环节。暑伏期间，棉花开花最快最多，结的棉桃也大，成熟后吐絮质量良好，群众通称为“中喷花”。但是，这个期间，也是棉花蕾铃脱落最多的时候。根据历年情况，棉株中、下部的蕾铃，往往脱落70％到80％。因此，确保伏桃，就成了保证棉花获得高额丰产的重要关键。会议指出，要想防止暑伏期间蕾铃脱落，主要是以调剂肥、水、温（通风）、光（日照）为中心，采取各项措施，给棉花创造良好的生长环境。
    会议指出，抓好秋桃是去年棉花大丰收的一项重要经验。今年，在确保伏桃的基础上，应该大抓秋桃。促使棉花多结秋桃的中心问题，是加强棉田后期管理：要增施肥料，天旱时要适当灌溉；还可根据霜期早晚，适当推迟打顶，多留果枝，以便多结秋桃。但是，盲目多留果枝或不打顶尖，也是不对的，要注意防止。
    会议认为，苗期管理、多座伏前桃、确保伏桃，抓好秋桃这四个环节是互相关联的，一个环节，特别是第一个环节的工作抓不好，其他环节就要受到影响，因此，要从头抓起，环环扣紧。当前，要确实作好查苗补苗工作，搞好苗期管理，以便做到合理密植和苗全苗壮。
    为了搞好以上四个阶段的棉田管理工作，力争棉花大丰收，会议号召各棉区立即开展大面积丰产竞赛运动。在运动中，各级领导既要抓大面积丰产田，又要组织广大群众注意对一般田的管理，把广种多收和少种高产多收结合起来。
    参加会议的有河北、山东、河南、江西、湖北、辽宁、上海等十六个省、市的农业厅、局长，河北省产棉区的专、县农业局长，以及一部分植棉模范。会议期间，代表们参观了石家庄市郊区留营生产队的棉田管理。（附图片）
