    Reported by this newspaper: According to the Soviet "Pravda" report: The Soviet exhibition in the United States will open on the 30th of this month in New York. This exhibition is being held in accordance with the "Agreement on Cultural, Technical and Educational Exchange" signed by the Soviet Union and the United States on January 27, 1958. The United States will also hold an exhibition in Moscow in July and August this year.

    The Soviet exhibition is scheduled to last for forty days and will be opened by Kozlov, First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers.

    The Soviet exhibition is located on the second and third floors of the "Coliseum" building. This building was built in 1959 on Columbus Square in downtown New York specifically for the exhibition.

    There are approximately 10,000 exhibits at the exhibition. The main task of the exhibition is to powerfully and convincingly demonstrate the outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union in peaceful creative labor, and to introduce to the audience the great program of the Soviet Union for building communism in the next seven years. Another task of the exhibition is to introduce to Americans the state structure of Soviet society and the characteristics of the Soviet socialist economy. A large number of documents will show that Russia, which was economically and culturally backward in the past, has become the most developed country in the world in the era of Soviet power. The exhibition will run through the spirit of friendship and equality among all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, and will reflect the Soviet Union’s desire for peace and friendly cooperation with the people of all countries in the world.

    The scientific achievements of the Soviet Union in the field of spaceflight will occupy an important place in the exhibition. Visitors will see models of three artificial satellites of the same size as the originals on a carefully designed exhibition wall that looks like a celestial dome.

    The exhibition will also widely reflect the extensive work done by the Soviet Union in the complete automation and mechanization of the production process. A large part of the exhibition is used to introduce scientific achievements and the peaceful use of atomic energy. A section is specially dedicated to the latest technologies and advanced production methods. At the exhibition, visitors will be able to see models of the "Lenin" nuclear icebreaker and new small sedans such as the "Seagull" and "Volga."

    In the agricultural section, visitors can learn about the characteristics of Soviet socialist agriculture and understand the widespread mechanization of agriculture and the reclamation of wasteland.

    Americans who are interested in the Soviet Union’s training of scientific cadres and educating the younger generation can also find answers at the exhibition.

    The exhibition will introduce to the audience in a clear and intuitive form the huge scale of residential construction and the rapid development of light industry and the food industry.

    The health care section will point out that the Soviet health care system has greatly increased people's average life expectancy, reduced morbidity, and reduced overall mortality and infant mortality. In addition, it also tells the audience that medical treatment is free in the Soviet Union.

    The exhibition also features excellent works by Soviet painters and sculptors. In a cinema near the exhibition, you can see Soviet panoramic films, short films and slides introducing Soviet life and scientific and technological achievements.

    During the exhibition, the Soviet Union and the United States will send actors and artistic performing groups to each other.

    显示苏联建设成就　加强苏美人民友谊
    苏联展览会即将在纽约开幕
    本报讯　据苏联“真理报”报导：苏联在美国举办的展览会将于本月30日在纽约开幕。这个展览会是根据1958年1月27日苏联和美国签订的“关于文化、技术和教育交流”的协定而举行的。今年7、8月间美国也将在莫斯科举行展览会。
    苏联展览会的展览日期预定为四十天，将由苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫主持开幕式。
    苏联展览会位于“科洛西姆”大楼的第二层和第三层上。这座大楼是1959年在纽约市中心的哥伦布广场上修建的，专供展览会之用。
    展览会上约有一万件展品。展览会的主要任务是：有力而令人信服地展示苏联在和平创造性劳动方面的杰出成就，向观众们介绍苏联在今后七年内建设共产主义的伟大纲领。展览会的另一任务是向美国人介绍苏维埃社会的国家结构以及苏联社会主义经济的特点。大量文献将表明：过去经济和文化落后的俄国在苏维埃政权年代已经成为世界上最发达的国家。展览会上将贯穿着苏联各族人民友好、平等的精神，并体现出苏联对和平、对同世界各国人民友好合作的愿望。
    苏联在有关宇宙飞行方面的科学成就在展览会上将占重要地位。观众们将在精心设计的像天穹一样的展览壁上看到三颗同原来一般大小的人造卫星模型。
    展览会还将广泛反映苏联在生产过程全盘自动化和机械化方面所做的大量工作。展览会有很大一部分用来介绍科学成就以及和平利用原子能的情况。有一部分专门介绍最新技术和先进生产方法。在展览会上，观众们将可看到“列宁”号原子破冰船的模型和“海鸥”、“伏尔加”等牌的新型小卧车。
    在农业部分，观众们可以了解到苏联社会主义农业的特点，了解农业的广泛机械化和开垦荒地的情况。
    对苏联培养科学干部和教育青年一代感兴趣的美国人，也可以在展览会上找到答复。
    展览会将以明了直观的形式向观众们介绍住宅建筑的巨大规模、轻工业和食品工业的迅速发展。
    保健部分将指出苏联保健设施系统使人的平均寿命大大增加、患病率降低、总的死亡率和儿童死亡率降低。此外还告诉观众在苏联医药治疗是免费的。
    会上还有苏联画家和雕刻家的优秀作品。在展览会附近的一个电影院里可以看到苏联的全景电影、介绍苏联生活和科技成就的短片和幻灯。
    展览会期间苏美两国将互派演员和艺术表演团。
