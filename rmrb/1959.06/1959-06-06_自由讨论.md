    Free Discussion
    Today's publication of news regarding the three academic discussion meetings held consecutively in Beijing by the Chinese Philosophical Society, and the news published on June 1st concerning the economic theory discussion meeting held in Shanghai by the Chinese economics community, demonstrate the new atmosphere of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in theoretical issues within China's philosophical and economic circles.
    The great leap forward practice of current socialist construction presents the academic community with extremely rich theoretical problems, which must be resolved through the implementation of the "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, seeking solutions through free discussion and mutual debate. In the academic discussions in both the capital and Shanghai, the "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" approach, fully presenting facts, reasoning, freely debating, and maintaining a comfortable state of mind to seek truth, is a good start for further promoting academic research.
    We hope that academic circles in various regions will adopt diverse forms of activity,展开 "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in a prepared and planned manner, and flourish our era's academic research.

    自由讨论
    今天发表的中国哲学会在北京连续举行的三个学术讨论会和6月1日发表的我国经济学界在上海举行的经济理论讨论会的消息，表现了我国哲学界和经济学界在理论问题上的百家争鸣的新气象。
    当前社会主义建设事业伟大的跃进实践，给学术界提出了极为丰富的理论问题，必须贯彻百家争鸣的方针，从自由讨论、互相争辩中求得解决。在首都和上海两地的学术问题讨论中，百家争鸣，充分摆事实、讲道理，自由争辩，心情舒畅，求得真理，是进一步推动学术研究工作开展的良好开端。
    我们希望各地学术界采取多种多样的活动方式，有准备有计划地展开百家争鸣，繁荣我们时代的学术研究。
