Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 31st—Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have begun harvesting pine resin. Mengshan County, which produces more than 10,000 dan of pine resin annually, has organized a professional pine resin harvesting team of more than 500 people. In the past twenty-odd days, Meijiang Commune in this county has harvested more than 17,600 jin of pine resin. Yishan, Dayao Mountain, and Nandan counties in the Liuzhou Special District have also started harvesting pine resin this year. In order to do a good job in purchasing, commercial departments in various resin-producing areas promptly organized forces to go deep into the field, signed contracts with various communes and production brigades, and assisted in the harvesting, preservation, and transportation.

Guangxi has a large number of pine forests and abundant pine resin resources. The rosin produced locally is sold to more than a dozen countries overseas in addition to supplying the domestic market in our country.
