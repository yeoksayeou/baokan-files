Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th - According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong: At a peace rally held today by people from all walks of life in Kaesong City, a resolution was passed strongly demanding that the US military immediately withdraw from South Korea, taking with them the atomic weapons and rocket weapons they illegally brought into South Korea.

Han Sorya, Chairman of the Korean National Peace Committee, and leading party and government officials of Kaesong City attended today's rally.

Chong Jin-seop, President of Songdo Political and Economic University, delivered a report at the rally, strongly condemning the crimes of the US imperialists in undermining the armistice agreement and bringing atomic weapons into South Korea in an attempt to provoke a new war. He called on the Korean people to launch a nationwide struggle to force the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, in anticipation of the June 25th "Day of Struggle to Force the Withdrawal of US Troops from South Korea."

Representatives from all walks of life in Kaesong City, including workers and farmers, spoke at the meeting. They expressed their determination to take practical actions to promote the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st - Our correspondent reports: The struggle of the South Korean people against the American occupationists and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, and for survival and democratic rights, is expanding and developing.

The South Korean working class is at the forefront of this struggle. According to materials published by the South Korean authorities, South Korean workers held more than 200 strikes, marches, demonstrations, slowdowns, and collective protests last year to oppose the cruel exploitation by the US-Rhee clique and capitalists, and to demand improved living conditions. In some places, slogans were also raised demanding the withdrawal of US troops and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. In 1954, there were 44 such struggles, which increased year by year, reaching five times the number in 1954 last year. In addition, the workers have further strengthened their unity in the struggle. Last year, the employees of 38 automobile companies and 20 textile factories respectively united to launch a struggle against 16-hour and 12-hour working days and to strive for an eight-hour working day.

Since the beginning of this year, the struggle of South Korean workers has further expanded, with 32 incidents occurring in the first four months alone. On June 1 this year, the struggle of 20,000 dockworkers in Busan to demand a 50%-80% wage increase was victorious. The business owners were forced to accept the workers' demands half an hour before the workers began a general strike. On May 11 this year, 20,000 workers in Incheon also held a demonstration demanding payment of back wages. Six hundred Korean workers employed by the "Korean Trading Office" run by the US military in Incheon also launched a struggle against the American occupiers, opposing forced use of English, opposing beatings, opposing unwarranted dismissals, and demanding an eight-hour working day. This struggle was unanimously echoed by Korean workers employed by the US military in Busan, Seoul, Osan, and Paju.

South Korean youth and students have also launched a struggle against the US war policy and refuse to serve in the Rhee puppet army. According to South Korean authorities, there are now 150,000 young people in South Korea "evading military service." One out of every twenty-one people in Seoul is a "draft dodger." The Syngman Rhee clique requires university students to serve in the military, but only 7.6% of Seoul university students are enlisting. South Korean students are increasingly holding strikes, marches, and sit-ins to oppose the Syngman Rhee clique's exorbitant tuition fees and mass expulsions.

The peasants, who have suffered the most from the Syngman Rhee clique's exploitation, have also risen up to resist the Rhee regime's tyranny. At the beginning of this year, peasant representatives from Goyang County demonstrated in front of the South Korean puppet National Assembly in Seoul to protest the atrocities of Rhee's puppet officials who plundered their land. Last year, 3,000 farmers in Jincheon County, North Chungcheong Province, collectively protested against the Syngman Rhee authorities' disregard for water conservancy and irrigation projects and forced collection of water conservancy fees. More than 1,000 farmers in Boeun County and Goesan County in the same province also held rallies to oppose Syngman Rhee's forced purchase of agricultural products at prices lower than the cost of production. In addition, farmers in various places have launched struggles against exorbitant taxes, and against the US-Rhee army's forcible occupation of land to build military bases.

The South Korean press also issued statements and passed resolutions at the end of last year and in the first half of this year, condemning the Syngman Rhee clique's fascist bill, the "New National Security Law," and the reactionary measures to suppress freedom of speech, such as closing down newspapers and periodicals such as "Kyunghyang Shinmun."

Ignoring the brutal suppression by the US military and the Syngman Rhee clique, people from all walks of life in South Korea have recently launched direct struggles demanding the withdrawal of US troops and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. On February 24 and 25 this year, leaflets, slogans, and pamphlets reading "US troops get out of South Korea and Taiwan," "Long live the peaceful reunification of the fatherland," and "Oppose the New National Security Law" appeared continuously in the most prosperous areas of Seoul, including Jongno-gu, Seongdong-gu, and Yeongdeungpo-gu. Last July, anti-American leaflets appeared near the US Embassy in Seoul, the headquarters of the US Eighth Army, and other prosperous streets.

    朝鲜开城人民集会要求美军撤退
    南朝鲜群众反对美李集团的斗争日益扩大
    新华社平壤20日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：开城市各界群众在今天举行的拥护和平大会上通过决议，强硬要求美军携带他们非法运入南朝鲜的原子武器和火箭武器，立即撤出南朝鲜。
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长韩雪野和开城市的党政领导人出席了今天的大会。
    松都政治经济大学校长郑镇燮在大会上作了报告，强烈谴责美帝国主义者破坏停战协定，把原子武器运入南朝鲜，企图挑起新的战争的罪行。他号召朝鲜人民在迎接6月25日“使美军撤出南朝鲜斗争日”的时候，为迫使美军撤出南朝鲜和实现祖国的和平统一展开全民性的斗争。
    开城市的工人、农民等各界代表都在会上讲了话。他们表示要用实际行动来促使美军撤出南朝鲜。
    据新华社平壤21日电　本社记者报道：南朝鲜人民反对美国占领者和李承晚卖国集团、争取生存和民主权利的斗争日益扩大和发展。
    南朝鲜工人阶级站在这一斗争最前列。根据南朝鲜当局发表的材料，去年一年南朝鲜工人举行了二百多次罢工、游行示威、怠工、集体抗议等斗争，反对美李集团和资本家的残酷剥削，要求改善生活待遇。有的地方还提出了要求美军撤退和和平统一祖国的口号。在1954年，这种斗争发生了四十四起，以后逐年增加，去年斗争的次数已达1954年的五倍。另外，在斗争中工人们进一步加强了团结，去年曾有三十八家汽车公司的职工和二十家纺织厂的职工分别联合在一起，展开反对十六小时和十二小时的劳动时间、争取八小时工作制的斗争。
    今年以来，南朝鲜工人的斗争进一步扩大，仅头四个月即已发生了三十二起。今年6月1日釜山两万码头工人要求提高工资50％—80％的斗争取得了胜利，企业主在工人开始总罢工前半小时，被迫接受了工人的要求。今年5月11日在仁川也发生了两万名工人游行示威，要求发给欠发工资。仁川美军经营的“朝鲜交易处”所雇佣的六百名朝鲜工人也曾经同美国占领者展开过斗争，反对强迫使用英语，反对殴打，反对无故解雇，要求实行八小时工作制。这一斗争并且得到了釜山、汉城、乌山、坡州等地的美军雇用的朝鲜工人一致的响应。
    南朝鲜的青年学生也展开了反对美国的战争政策，拒绝到李伪军中服兵役的斗争。据南朝鲜当局透露，现在南朝鲜有十五万青年“逃避兵役”。汉城市每二十一个人中就有一个“兵役逃避者”。李承晚集团要求大学生服兵役，但汉城大学生中应征入伍的不过7.6％。南朝鲜的学生举行罢课、游行、静坐，反对李承晚集团过重的学费、反对集体开除的斗争也越来越多。
    遭受李承晚集团盘剥最厉害的农民也忍无可忍，起来反抗李承晚集团的虐政。今年年初，高阳郡的农民代表曾在汉城南朝鲜伪国会前示威，抗议李伪官吏掠夺他们土地的暴行。去年，忠清北道镇川郡曾有三千农民集体抗议李承晚当局漠视水利灌溉事业并强征水利费的行为。这个道的报恩郡和槐山郡的一千多农民也举行集会，反对李承晚以低于生产成本的价格强购农产品。另外，各地农民还展开斗争，反对苛捐杂税，反对美李军队强占土地修建军事基地。
    南朝鲜的新闻界在去年年底和今年上半年也不断发表声明，通过决议，谴责李承晚集团制订的法西斯法案“新国家保安法”以及封闭“京乡新闻”等报刊的迫害言论自由的反动措施。
    南朝鲜各界人民不顾美军和李承晚集团的残酷镇压，近来还直接展开要求美军撤走、要求和平统一祖国的斗争。今年2月24日和25日，在汉城市最繁华的地区——钟路区和城东区、永登浦区等地区，连续出现了写着“美军从南朝鲜和台湾滚出去”、“祖国和平统一万岁”、“反对新国家保安法”的传单、标语和小册子。去年7月间在汉城美国大使馆、美军第八军司令部附近以及其他繁华的街道上，都曾出现过反美传单。
