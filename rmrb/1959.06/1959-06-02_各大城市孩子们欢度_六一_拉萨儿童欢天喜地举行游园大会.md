Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: Today, the children of the capital joyfully celebrated International Children's Day "June 1st."

Early in the morning, children dressed in new holiday clothes flocked to various public places in groups to participate in rich, colorful, and meaningful holiday activities. The beautiful Summer Palace, Beihai Park, the Working People's Cultural Palace, and the Temple of Heaven, among other parks, were open to children free of charge and held garden parties.

Xinhua News Agency reports that children in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and other places joyfully celebrated International Children's Day "June 1st."

On the morning of May 31st, more than three thousand children in Shanghai held a celebration meeting. Liu Shuzhou, Alternate Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and Zhang Xibo, Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, extended holiday congratulations to the children.

In Tianjin, more than two thousand Young Pioneers held a celebration meeting on June 1st. In recent days, Young Pioneers in various districts of Tianjin have also held various celebration activities such as get-togethers and bonfire parties.

One hundred thousand children in Shenyang held garden parties on June 1st in parks such as Beiling, Zhongshan, and Nanhu.

Thirty thousand children in Xi'an gathered on May 31st to warmly celebrate "June 1st" Children's Day. Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other party and government leaders attended the meeting and celebrated the festival with the children.

More than twelve hundred children in Guangzhou gathered at the City Federation of Trade Unions on the morning of May 31st to celebrate "June 1st" International Children's Day.

On the evening of May 31st, the Chongqing Children's Palace was decorated in colorful splendor to welcome more than four thousand children to celebrate "June 1st."

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, June 1st: More than three thousand children of all ethnic groups in Lhasa held a garden party today in the tranquil Xuelin Garden in front of the Potala Palace, joyfully celebrating their first "June 1st" Children's Day since the suppression of the rebellion.

Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Tibetan children did not have their own festival; after the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary groups obstructed children from carrying out celebration activities every Children's Day. Today, the reactionary regime that had long oppressed the people and children of Tibet has been dissolved, and Tibetan children can joyfully celebrate their own festival. This morning, children from Lhasa Middle School, Lhasa Nos. 1, 2, and 3 Elementary Schools, and the nineteen cultural schools run by various residents' committees in Lhasa City, carrying five-star red flags, Young Pioneer flags, and colorful small flags, enthusiastically went to Xuelin Garden. One hundred and one outstanding children took an oath to join the Young Pioneers at the garden party. Most of them are children of poor people and serfs, and some are new students who enrolled after the Lhasa rebellion was suppressed.

Afterwards, the children engaged in various games organized by themselves on the grass covered with irises. Many children from serf, slave, and poor families wore clean clothes today. They participated in various performances of entertainment programs, innocent and lively, and lovable.

Today, many parents of children in Lhasa also came to Xuelin Garden to play with their children. Nima Buzhen, a female boot maker, specially brought her three children a hearty lunch of fried cakes and sour milk. Her eldest son, Pengcuo Wangdui, is studying at Lhasa No. 1 Elementary School and just joined the Young Pioneers today. Nima Buzhen happily said to others, "In the past, we who made boots were the most lowly, and our children had no chance to learn to read. Now, not only can my eldest son go to school, but he has also joined the Young Pioneers. I am really too happy in my heart. A thousand thanks and ten thousand thanks cannot express my gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party."

    西藏和平解放前，西藏儿童没有自己的节日；西藏和平解放后，每届儿童节，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团都阻挠孩子们进行庆祝活动。今天，长期压在西藏人民和儿童头上的反动政权被解散了，西藏儿童可以欢乐地庆祝自己的节日。今天上午，拉萨中学，拉萨第一、二，三小学和拉萨市各居民委员会兴办的十九所文化学校的儿童们打着五星红旗、少先队旗和各色小彩旗，兴致勃勃地前往雪策林卡。一百零一名优秀儿童在游园大会上宣誓入队。他们之中，大都是贫民和农奴的子弟，有的还是拉萨叛乱平息后才入学的新学生。
    随后，孩子们在长满了马兰花的草地上进行他们自己组织的各种游戏。许多出身农奴、奴隶和贫民家庭的孩子，今天都穿着干净的衣服，他们参加演出各种文娱节目，天真活泼，逗人喜爱。
    今天，拉萨市许多儿童的家长也来到雪策林卡里和孩子们一起玩乐。女皮靴工尼玛卜珍特地给他的三个孩子带来了丰美的午餐油饼和酸牛奶。她的大儿子彭错旺堆在拉萨第一小学读书，今天刚加入少先队。尼玛卜珍高兴地对别人说：“过去，我们这些作靴子的人最下贱，自己的孩子根本没有读书识字的机会。现在，我的大儿子不但能上学，而且又参加了少先队，我心里实在太高兴了，千恩万谢也表达不出我感谢毛主席和共产党的心意。”
