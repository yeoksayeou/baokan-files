Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 14th - According to the Indian Press Trust of India in Kathmandu, Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala issued a joint communiqué today. The communiqué stated that the two Prime Ministers believe that pursuing a policy of non-alignment with any military blocs and maintaining friendly relations with all countries is the best way for both countries to contribute to world peace and their own interests.

The communiqué said, "They particularly want to seek more mutual understanding and cooperation among Asian countries."

The communiqué stated that the two countries have consistent views on international and domestic issues. Both sides believe that world peace and the elimination of the danger of war are paramount, which can lead to gradual disarmament. The communiqué expressed hope that the Geneva Conference will lead to the adoption of certain steps towards easing world tensions and gradually resolving issues that threaten peace.

The communiqué also stated that the two Prime Ministers believe that no country should be ruled by another country, and that colonial rule "in any form" should end.

The communiqué mentioned that the two Prime Ministers discussed the "recent developments" in Tibet during their talks.

Nehru left Kathmandu today after a three-day visit to Nepal and returned to New Delhi. Before his departure, he held a press conference in Kathmandu, talking about Sino-Indian relations.

Nehru said that he sees no threat to the Indian border as a result of the developments in Tibet. A provocative question was raised: whether the situation in Tibet requires a reconsideration of the Indian and Nepalese defense systems. Nehru replied that if the question refers to a threat from the north, "I don't see any such threat."

In response to a question about whether India would conclude an agreement with Nepal on the Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence), he said that there is no question of concluding agreements with various countries on the Panchsheel. This is a matter of principle. He said that India agrees with this principle, and he believes that Nepal also agrees. He said, "A Panchsheel agreement on paper is not an agreement." In response to another question, he said that more than one, but many countries have violated the Panchsheel. However, he declined to name any such country.

    印度总理和尼泊尔首相
    发表两国会谈公报
    新华社新德里14日电　据印度报业托辣斯加德满都消息，印度总理尼赫鲁同尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊今天发表了一项联合公报。公报说，两国总理相信，奉行不同军事集团结盟和同一切国家保持友好关系的政策是两国为世界和平和它们本国的利益尽力的最好办法。
    公报说，“他们特别是要在亚洲国家之间谋求更多的互相了解和合作。”
    公报说，两国对国际、国内问题的政策上的看法是一致的。双方相信，世界和平和消除战争危险是首要的事，它们可以导致逐步的裁军。公报表示希望日内瓦会议将导致采取某些步骤，向着缓和世界紧张局势和逐步解决威胁和平的问题的方向前进。
    公报又说，两国总理认为，任何国家不应当被另一个国家统治，“任何形式”的殖民统治都应当结束。
    公报提到，两国总理在会谈中讨论了西藏“最近事态的发展”。
    尼赫鲁在尼泊尔进行了三天访问以后已经于今天离开加德满都回到新德里。行前他在加德满都举行了一次记者招待会，谈到了中印关系问题。
    尼赫鲁说，他看不出由于西藏事态的发展而引起对印度边界的任何威胁。有人提出一个挑拨性的问题：由于西藏的局势是否需要重新考虑印度和尼泊尔的防御体系。尼赫鲁回答说，如果问题是指来自北面的威胁的话，“我看不出有任何这样的威胁”。
    在回答关于印度是否要同尼泊尔就潘查希拉（和平共处五项原则）缔结协议的问题时，他说，不发生同各国就潘查希拉缔结协议的问题。这是原则上的事。他说，印度同意这个原则，他相信尼泊尔也同意。他说，“对于潘查希拉的纸上协定并不是协议。”他在回答另一个问题时说，不止一个，而是有许多国家都违反了潘查希拉。但是他拒绝说出任何一个这样国家的名字。
