Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 19th: Sixteen million mu of wheat in Shanxi Province are ripening successively. The intense and joyous wheat harvest is expanding from the Jinnan Plain to the areas north of the Great Wall. As of the 16th, 5.5 million mu of wheat had been harvested throughout the province.

Due to deep plowing, close planting, ample fertilizer, sufficient water, and meticulous processing, this year's wheat in Shanxi Province has grown with many stalks and large ears, and the grains are plump. The harvesting commune members are increasingly happy as they reap, and some joyfully sing in the fields: Golden waves ripple across the wheat fields, sickles flash white light everywhere, harvest songs are sung, hearts rejoice, hands busy. The Jinnan area, where harvesting began earlier, has already reported widespread high yields. In Jishan County, the 380,000 mu of wheat that has already been threshed has achieved an average yield of over 300 jin per mu. Fifty production teams, totaling 12,900 mu of wheat, have achieved an average yield of over 500 jin per mu. Many villages have all their threshing grounds filled with wheat stacks, and new threshing grounds have been opened.

Various localities made relatively thorough preparations before the wheat harvest began. Jinnan Special District has made ample preparations for this year's wheat harvest, with tight organization and concentrated strength. Party and government leading cadres at all levels have taken up sickles and gone deep into the fields to labor and direct the work simultaneously. Commercial departments, agricultural implement repair factories, medical departments, and postal and telecommunications departments have all dispatched a large number of staff members, taking sickles to the fields to both labor and serve the harvesting commune members. The entire area also has over 30,000 cadres from government offices, factory workers, and students from schools forming wheat harvesting expedition teams to help communes with labor shortages. The children of each commune have also formed wheat-gathering teams, following behind the harvesting army to gather wheat, reaping and gathering as they go.

The Jinzhong Plain and the Taihang Mountain area, where wheat ripens later, are now rolling with wheat waves, shimmering with golden light. Each commune's wheat harvest preparations are complete, waiting only for the opening of the sickles. In areas inside and outside the Great Wall, where there is more wind and sand and a colder climate, very little wheat was produced historically. This year, the planting area of spring wheat has been expanded, and the growth is now good. Communes in various localities are stepping up later-stage management.

    镰刀闪白光　心欢手里忙
    山西收麦工作正由南向北推进
    新华社太原19日电　山西省一千六百万亩小麦陆续成熟。紧张愉快的麦收工作正由晋南平原向古长城以北塞上地区扩展，到16日，全省已收割小麦五百五十万亩。
    由于深耕、密植、肥多、水足、加工周到，山西省今年小麦长得株多穗大，籽粒饱满。抢收的社员们愈割愈高兴，有些人在田间欢乐地唱道：一片麦田翻金浪，遍地镰刀闪白光，丰收歌儿嘴上唱，心里高兴手里忙。收割较早的晋南地区，已经传出了大面积丰产的消息。稷山县已经脱粒的三十八万亩小麦，平均亩产达到三百斤以上，有五十个生产队共一万二千九百亩小麦，平均亩产达到五百斤以上。不少村庄所有的打麦场都堆满了麦垛，还开辟了新的打麦场。
    各地在麦收开始前，都做了比较充分的准备。晋南专区今年麦收工作准备充分，组织严密，力量集中，各级党政领导干部都带上镰刀，深入田间，一边劳动，一边指挥。商业部门、农具修配厂、医务部门、邮电部门都抽出大部分工作人员，带上镰刀到田间，一边劳动，一边为收麦社员服务。全区还有三万多名机关干部、厂矿职工、学校学生等组成的麦收远征队伍，到劳动力缺乏的公社帮助收割。各公社的儿童也组成拾麦队，跟在麦收大军后边拾麦，割到那里，拾到那里。
    小麦成熟较晚的晋中平原和太行山区，现在已经麦浪滚滚，金光闪闪。各公社的麦收准备工作都已就绪，只等开镰。风沙多气候寒冷的古长城内外地区，历史上生产小麦很少，今年扩大了春小麦的播种面积，现在生长情况良好，已经抽穗，各地公社正加紧后期管理。
