Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 22nd - According to TASS: Soviet university students, young workers, students from People's Democratic countries and Asian and African countries studying in Moscow, held a rally at the Moscow University Club on the 20th to commemorate the upcoming Day of Struggle for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Sudanese student Rashid Othman, Soviet worker representative Chernobrovkin, journalist Irina Volkova, who reported from Korea during the Korean War, and a representative of Chinese students, spoke at the meeting.

The resolution passed at the meeting stated that Moscow university students and Asian and African students studying in the Soviet Union were pleased with the achievements of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and protested the brutal acts of the US imperialists and their accomplice, the Syngman Rhee clique. The resolution stated that the Syngman Rhee clique had ruined the South Korean economy and led the Korean people into poverty.

The resolution emphasized that the whole world condemned the barbaric act of the colonialists and the Syngman Rhee clique selling Koreans to South American plantations and mines as slaves. We warmly support the Korean people's struggle for the reunification of their fatherland and for world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 23rd - Sofia newspapers today published a statement by the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, which expressed its enthusiastic support for designating June 25th as "Day of Struggle for International Solidarity for Peaceful Reunification of Korea and Withdrawal of US Troops from South Korea."

The statement pointed out that the Chinese People's Volunteers had long since withdrawn from northern Korea. However, US imperialism continues to linger in South Korea, hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea. US troops frequently test nuclear weapons near the military demarcation line, threatening peace in the Far East and the world.

The statement said that the Bulgarian people and all peace-loving people around the world cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that South Korea is becoming a new hotbed of war. All peace-loving people around the world demand that US troops withdraw from South Korea immediately, thereby preparing conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea and eliminating the threat of war in the region.

    新华社莫斯科22日电　据塔斯社讯：苏联大学生、青年职工、人民民主国家和亚非国家在莫斯科的留学生，20日在莫斯科大学俱乐部集会，纪念即将到来的争取美军撤出南朝鲜和和平统一朝鲜的斗争日。
    苏丹留学生拉希德·欧斯曼、苏联工人代表契尔诺布罗夫金、在朝鲜战争期间曾在朝鲜采访的记者伊林娜·沃尔科和中国的留学生代表等都在会上讲了话。
    会上通过的决议中说，莫斯科大学生和亚非留苏学生对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民的成就感到高兴，并对美帝国主义及其帮凶李承晚分子的残暴行为表示抗议。决议说，李承晚分子破坏了南朝鲜的经济，把朝鲜人民引向了贫困。
    决议强调指出，全世界都痛斥殖民主义者和李承晚分子把朝鲜人出卖给南美种植园和矿山当奴隶的野蛮行为。我们热烈地支持朝鲜人民争取统一祖国和争取世界和平的斗争。
    新华社索非亚23日电　索非亚各报今天刊登了保加利亚祖国阵线全国委员会的一项声明，这项声明表示，热烈支持把6月25日作为“争取国际团结和平统一朝鲜和美军撤出南朝鲜斗争日”。
    声明指出，人民中国志愿军早已从朝鲜北部撤了出去。但是，美国帝国主义却继续赖在南朝鲜，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。美军经常在军事分界线附近试验核武器，威胁远东和世界和平。
    声明说，保加利亚人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，对南朝鲜正在变为新的战争策源地这一情况不能熟视无睹。全世界爱好和平的人民都要求美国军队立即从南朝鲜撤走，从而为和平统一朝鲜准备条件，并且消除这一地区的战争威胁。
