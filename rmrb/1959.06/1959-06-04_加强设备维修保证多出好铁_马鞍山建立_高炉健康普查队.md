    Strengthen Equipment Maintenance to Ensure More High-Quality Iron
    Ma'anshan Establishes a "Blast Furnace Health Examination Team"

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Reporter Yu Feng reports: Recently, around the blast furnaces of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, one could often see groups of people. Some climbed to the top of the furnace to check the charging equipment, some used blue-tinted glasses to inspect the tuyeres, and others observed the weighing cars above the material pits. They were neither furnace workers nor visiting outsiders. They are the newly formed comprehensive equipment inspection team of the Iron and Steel Company—the "Blast Furnace Health Examination Team," most welcomed by the workers.

    In order to ensure the normal production of iron and to stably improve the quality and output of pig iron, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has adopted five measures to strengthen equipment maintenance: organizing comprehensive equipment inspection teams to carefully check the usage of equipment in each blast furnace, so as to carry out maintenance work in a comprehensive and planned way; organizing the machine repair factory to rush-manufacture spare parts, inspecting and repairing simultaneously; establishing equipment maintenance regulations, strictly enforcing reasonable existing regulations, and promptly revising or re-drafting unsuitable ones; determining the number of spare parts to be manufactured and the time of use according to the usage time of the components, so as to be prepared for any eventuality; restoring the equipment pre-repair system to achieve accident-free maintenance, so as to avoid being passive.

    This comprehensive equipment inspection team (composed of heads of mechanical, power, design, and supply departments, as well as experienced workers and technicians) is divided into: a charging system inspection team, specializing in inspecting furnace top charging, hoists, weighing cars, and other equipment; a furnace front and hot blast system inspection team, inspecting the furnace's tuyeres, slag notches, tapholes, and the entire set of hot blast stove equipment; and a power system inspection team, specializing in inspecting the furnace's water, electricity, wind, and temperature. During the inspection, they first talked with furnace chiefs, foremen, and workers, fully listened to their opinions, understood the equipment's wear and tear, and conducted inspections one by one. In just over two days, they preliminarily identified 196 items of blast furnace equipment that needed maintenance and repair, 218 items that needed spare parts, and 43 items that needed research and improvement. Some of these items urgently need to be repaired, such as the hot blast main pipe of No. 13 furnace, hot blast and induced draft valves, and efforts have been organized to repair them. Some spare parts have already been rushed to production by the machine repair factory, and other items are being arranged for repair or manufacturing according to their importance and urgency. The blast furnace workers welcomed this inspection team very much. They said that as long as there are spare parts, they can confidently increase the air volume to ensure that the quality and output of iron will increase. They actively put forward more than 400 suggestions to the inspection team. Other measures to strengthen equipment maintenance are also underway.

    加强设备维修保证多出好铁
    马鞍山建立“高炉健康普查队”
    本报讯　记者于凤报道：最近在马鞍山钢铁公司高炉身旁，常常看到一些人，他们三三两两结成一组，有的爬上炉顶查看布料设备，有的拿着蓝镜查看风口，有的在料坑上面观察称量车。他们既不是炉前工，也不是外来的访问者。他们是钢铁公司新组成的设备综合调查组——工人们最欢迎的“高炉健康普查队”。
    马鞍山钢铁公司为了保证高炉正常出铁，稳定地提高生铁的质量、产量，采取了加强设备保养维修的五项措施：组织设备综合检查组，仔细检查各个高炉设备使用情况，以便全面地有计划地进行保养维修工作；组织机修厂突击制造配件，边检查、边修理；建立设备保养维护制度，对过去已有的制度，合理的必须严格执行，不合用的迅速进行修改或重订；根据部件使用时间，确定备件制造数量和使用时间，做到有备无患；恢复设备预修制度，做到无事故检修，以免被动。
    这个设备综合检查组（由机械、动力、设计、供应等部门的负责人和老师傅、技术员组成）分为：上料系统检查组，专门检查炉顶布料，卷扬机、称量车等设备；炉前和热风系统检查组，检查高炉的风口、渣口、铁口和热风炉的全套设备；动力系统检查组，专门检查高炉的水、电、风、温。在检查中，他们首先和炉长、工长、工人交谈，充分听取意见，了解设备损耗情况，逐一进行检查，在两天多时间中，初步检查出高炉设备需要维护检修的有一百九十六项，需要配件的有二百十八项，需要研究改进的有四十三项。这些项目中有些急待检修的，如十三号炉的热风总管，热风、引风阀，已组织力量进行检修，有些备件，机修厂已开始赶制，其他项目也分别轻重缓急，安排计划进行检修或制造。高炉工人很欢迎这个检查组，他们说，只要有备件，就可以放心加大风量保证铁的质量产量上升。他们主动向检查组提出了四百多项建议。加强设备保养维修的其他措施，也正在进行。
