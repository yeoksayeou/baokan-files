    Calculating Machine
    Calculating the price of lumber used to be done manually. Mao Zhenghua, from the Luotian forest region in Fujian Province, created a foot-pedal-operated lumber calculating machine that increased work efficiency fivefold compared to manual calculations. Lumber settlement is a complex task, involving factors such as grade differences, length differences, diameter differences, distance differences, as well as wood type and volume. Settling the price of a single piece of lumber manually takes at least five minutes.

    计价机
    计算木材价格，过去一直是用人工。福建省罗田林区毛正华创制了一部脚踏木材计价机，比人工计算提高工效五倍。木材结算是件复杂工作，如等级差、长度差、径级差、里程差以及材种别、材积别等，结算一根木材，用人工至少要花五分钟。
