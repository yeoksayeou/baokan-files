Raise More Fat Pigs, Sell More Fat Pigs
    Shangshui County Averages More Than Two Pigs Per Household
    Exceeded Procurement Target by 73% Since Last Autumn
    According to a Henan Daily report: Shangshui County, Henan, implemented the policy of combining public and private pig raising, effectively mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm for raising pigs. The county now has 352,781 pigs (an average of more than two pigs per household), of which 284,781 are raised collectively, accounting for approximately 80% of the total; and 68,000 are raised privately, accounting for approximately 20%. From the communization movement to May of this year, a total of 82,719 qualified fat pigs were sold, exceeding the state procurement target by 73%.

    Last winter and spring, the county accumulated 28.9 billion catties of fertilizer from pig raising, enabling one to two applications of pig manure to be applied to all 1.1 million mu of wheat fields in the county. The rapid development of pig production has also driven the overall development of livestock and poultry in the county.

    Furthermore, Shangshui County's communes fully mobilized the masses to use substitute feeds to solve the problem of pig feed in the development of pig production. The county established 1,041 feed processing plants, processing more than 1.5 million catties of substitute feed daily. The 34 wineries operated by the county and communes signed long-term contracts to sell distiller's grains at low prices, specifically for pig feed. The commercial department purchased 160,000 catties of water hyacinth seedlings from Guangdong and is expanding cultivation. In addition to allocating feed plots to members for private pig raising, members are encouraged to bring baskets to the fields, never returning home empty-handed, storing feed in spring and summer for winter feeding. In terms of labor allocation, time is also arranged for members to raise pigs and plant feed. Pigs raised by canteens and individual members are grazed uniformly by the collective pig farm's keepers, who are paid a certain amount each month.

    Furthermore, Shangshui County's communes are raising a large number of sows, improving breeding techniques, and increasing the number of piglets.
    Currently, the county has developed 40,744 sows, established 1,441 piglet breeding farms and 18 breeding stations. The policy of "self-breeding, self-raising, self-sufficiency" is implemented, and campaigns for "no empty pregnancies for sows of breeding age" and "one pig producing ten sons and a hundred grandsons" are carried out. Double mating, re-mating, high production, and rapid production are actively promoted, and breeding experiences of "three comparisons" (comparing full pregnancy, reproductive rate, and survival rate) and "two fixings" (designated personnel, designated pens) are adopted.
    The collective pig farms of communes and teams supply a large number of piglets to members. Generally, piglets are sold for cash. For households with difficulties, piglets are lent to members at a price without interest, and the pig payment is repaid later.

    Furthermore, Shangshui County's communes pay close attention to reasonably resolving the issue of compensation for accumulating fertilizer from pig raising. The income from pig raising in pig farms belongs to the collective. The income from pig raising in canteens, after deducting 10% to 15% to reward cooks, all belongs to the canteen unit. All income from private pig raising by members belongs to themselves.

    Production teams purchase fertilizer from members at prices based on quality. Payment methods include: cash payment, in-kind exchange, and recording work points. After these methods were implemented, the phenomena of fertilizer loss and damage to crops have been greatly reduced.

    Furthermore, Shangshui County has a clear division of labor between public and private pig raising in the development of pig production. Production brigades raise sows, production teams raise fat pigs weighing more than 80 catties, and members raise piglets. The sow breeding farms of the production brigades sell the piglets to members after feeding them for 40 days. Members raise the pigs to 80 catties and sell them to the production team. The production team concentrates on fattening them to 130 to 150 catties and sells them to the state.

    多养肥猪　多卖肥猪
    商水县每户平均养猪两头多
    去秋以来超过收购任务73％
    据河南日报消息　河南商水县各人民公社贯彻执行了公养私养并举的方针，有效地调动了群众喂养生猪的积极性。这个县现有生猪三十五万二千七百八十一头（全县平均每户两头多），其中集体喂养二十八万四千七百八十一头，约占总数80％；私人喂养六万八千头，约占20％。从公社化到今年5月，共出售合格肥猪八万二千七百一十九头，超过国家收购任务的73％。
    去冬今春，全县养猪积攒肥料二百八十九亿斤，使全县一百一十万亩麦田普遍追猪肥一至两遍。生猪的迅速发展，还带动了全县家畜家禽的全面发展。
    又讯　商水县各公社在发展生猪生产中，充分发动群众利用代食品解决猪饲料。全县建立饲料加工厂一千零四十一个，每日加工代饲料一百五十余万斤；县、社经营的三十四个酒厂与猪场签定长期合同，低价出售酒糟，专作猪饲料；商业部门从广东采购十六万斤水浮莲苗，正在扩大培植。私人养猪除拨给社员饲料地以外，号召社员下地带箩头，回家不空手，春夏贮，冬季喂；在劳力出工方面，也安排了社员养猪、种植饲料的时间。食堂和社员个人养的猪，由集体养猪场饲养员统一放牧，每月付给一定报酬。
    又讯　商水县各公社大量喂养母猪，改良配种技术，增殖仔猪。
    现在，全县母猪已发展到四万零七百四十四头，建立仔猪繁殖场一千四百四十一个、种猪配种站十八处。贯彻执行“自繁、自养、自足”方针，开展“适龄母猪不空怀”和“一猪十子百孙”运动，积极推广双配、复配、多产、快产和采取三比（比满怀、比生殖率、比成活率）、二固定（专人、专圈）的繁殖经验。
    社、队集体养猪场，大量供应社员仔猪。一般采取现钱出售，对困难户采取无息将仔猪作价贷给社员，以后偿还猪款。
    又讯　商水县各公社都很注意合理解决养猪积肥的报酬问题。猪场养猪收入归集体所有；食堂养猪收入除抽出10％到15％奖励炊事员外，其余全部归食堂单位所有；社员私人养猪收入全部归自己。
    生产队收购社员的肥料，以质论价。付酬办法有：付现款，实物兑换，记工分三种。这些办法实行后，粪肥流失和损害庄稼等现象大大减少了。
    又讯　商水县在发展生猪生产中，公养和私养方面有明确的分工。生产大队养母猪，生产队养八十斤以上的肥猪，社员养仔猪。生产大队的母猪繁殖场，把仔猪喂养四十天后售给社员；社员把猪养到八十斤，售给生产队；生产队集中育肥到一百三十斤至一百五十斤，售给国家。
