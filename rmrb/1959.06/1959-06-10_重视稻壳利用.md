    Emphasizing Rice Husk Utilization
    The rice husks left over after rice processing have always been regarded as useless "waste." Farmers, in addition to using a small portion as feed, burn most of it as fuel. Little do people know that this "waste" can be refined into many valuable chemical raw materials.
    China produces a lot of rice, and the development of a comprehensive rice husk utilization industry has abundant resource conditions. According to estimates by relevant departments, if one-tenth of the country's total annual rice husk production could be used for dry distillation, it could create more than 2 billion yuan in wealth.
    The grain department of Changsha City, Hunan Province, has conscientiously learned from the experience of other places, overcome many difficulties, and used rice husks as raw materials to produce batches of seven kinds of chemical raw materials, such as methanol, acetone, and calcium acetate. This is a matter worthy of attention. If various regions widely adopt their practices and continue to strengthen scientific and technological research in this area, striving to extract more chemical raw materials from rice husks, it will also be of great significance in overcoming the current difficulties in the shortage of chemical raw materials.

    重视稻壳利用
    稻谷加工以后剩下的稻壳，一向被看作是没有用处的“废物”。农民除了用一小部分当作饲料外，绝大部分都当作燃料烧掉了。谁知道，这种“废物”却是可以提炼出很多宝贵的化工原料。
    我国产稻很多，发展稻壳综合利用事业，有着丰富的资源条件。根据有关部门推算，如果全国每年能利用稻壳总产量的十分之一进行干馏，就可以创造二十多亿元的财富。
    湖南长沙市粮食部门认真学习外地的经验，克服了许多困难，利用稻壳作原料，已经成批生产甲醇、丙酮、醋石等七种化工原料，这是一件值得重视的事情。如果各地广泛采用他们的做法，并且继续加强这方面的科学技术研究工作，尽力求得从稻壳中提炼出更多的化工原料来，这对于克服目前化工原料不足的困难，也是很有意义的。
