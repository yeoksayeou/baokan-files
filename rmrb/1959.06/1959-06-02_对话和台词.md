    The foundation of stage art is the literary script, and the foundation of the literary script is literary language, generally referred to as dialogue or lines. Dramatic action must be excavated from the lines, and the portrayal of character must also be expressed through literary language. Many famous plays have entire passages that people can recite and circulate; some famous plays not only leave behind typical characters, but also poetic literary language or aphorisms along with the characters' glorious images. Shakespeare's Hamlet is one of the characters well-known to those who love drama and literature, and the line that best represents Hamlet's character traits, "To be or not to be?" (see Zhu Shenghao's translation), has been used as a satirical comment on those who are hesitant.
    Different authors have different habits and preferences in the creation and use of literary language, so some well-known playwrights have their own styles. Some are known for their conciseness, some for their boldness, some for their delicacy, and some for their humor. Tian Han's works are different from Lao She's, and reading Xia Yan's works would never be mistaken for Cao Yu's.
    Drama is not just for reading, but mainly for performance, so the writer's style must be combined with performance practice to be fully realized. Performing the works of different writers requires mastering the characteristics of different writers. The overall artistic direction is the responsibility of the director, but in terms of character creation, actors must study the writer and his works by understanding the writer's style.
    Many young playwrights who are learning to write have not yet formed their own unique style. Whether or not they can form their own style is another question, but what they must first master is how to use literary language to create typical characters and how to write a play that works.
    The creation of typical characters is not just a matter of language, but whether the language is characterized and whether the language is rich in dramatic action is key to the creation of typical characters. Therefore, I would like to talk about some superficial views on the issue of language.
    We often read such plays, or see such performances, where the plot and story are still captivating, but the audience and readers can't help but lose patience. Why? It is because certain events have no special significance in the progress of the plot, but the characters repeat and repeat them in detail, explaining them over and over again; or certain events are sufficient in a few words, but the author writes a dozen or even dozens of sentences. At this time, the audience and readers will also lose patience. Note that this is not advocating simplification. As long as it starts from the characters, even a long speech will inevitably be welcomed. Isn't the character of Shi Yang in "Red Storm" an example? The problem lies in whether it starts from the characters and whether it starts from the given circumstances. The reason why people lose patience is that it is unreasonable, so it is unbelievable, that is, there is no play.
    Dramatic language comes from life, but simply copying the language of life is not equal to a play. The language that comes from life needs a process when used in a play, that is, a process of refinement and processing. We want the language of life, but this language of life has been processed and refined on the basis of life; only the processed and refined language is literary language.
    As for newly written operas and song dramas, there is also the issue of lyrics. Lyrics that are easy to sing, emotional, and full of lyrical meaning should be poetry. Literary language should be the language of poetry. At present, some opera and song drama lyrics are not so ideal. The clichés in opera have not been eliminated, and new operas are often difficult to sing because they are neither rhyming nor in meter. Sometimes the lyrics and dialogue are repeated. It is even more difficult to blame the audience for not being patient.
    Some people say that good film dialogue is very little, even so little that there is no dialogue; others say that it is enjoyable to perform Chekhov's plays because there are subtexts to be mined. If there is so little dialogue that there is none, then it is mime, not a spoken drama. Chekhov's plays are not liked by everyone to perform or watch. Styles should be diverse, and it is not appropriate to only advocate one kind, because the masses will not be satisfied with one form or one style. However, the literary language of drama should be full of action, should have subtexts to be mined, should leave room for actors to maneuver, so that actors have something to do, and should also leave room for the audience to imagine. So-called excess is as bad as deficiency, and art is valued for its implicitness. Therefore, the film's expression techniques and Chekhov's techniques should be learned. Learning is not imitation, and the purpose of learning also lies in that word "transformation."
    If the literary language of the script is not processed enough, it will bring great distress to the actors; if the lines are not life-like and characterized, how can the actors create vivid characters? Whether it is a modern play, a historical play, or a foreign play, if the lines are not easy to say, it will first hinder the actor's creative mood, let alone excavate inner actions from the lines and create typical characters.
    The actors' distress places demands on the playwrights, but let us also listen to the playwrights' opinions! Some writers are complaining, complaining that the actors have not worked hard on the lines, either swallowing words or not placing the stress in the right place. The meaning of the lines is not right, so the desired effect cannot be achieved. The audience sympathizes with the writers on this point.
    The actors' lines are also a common problem worthy of attention.
    It is said that in some theaters nowadays, there is very little rehearsal of the lines. Some actors, although not able to recite the lines at a glance, have a strong ability to memorize them. After receiving the script, they can drop the script on the stage in a few days. The lines are memorized, but they have not been "transformed." Why is this sentence said this way? What does he mean by saying this? Think about it and there are subtexts to be mined, but unfortunately there is not much time to think. Busy! A play is rehearsed in a few days, and it will be performed in a few days. The play must be rushed. How can we complain about the actors in this situation? The administrative arrangement of time is another issue, which will not be discussed here. For the actors, no matter how tight the time is, they must strive to rehearse the lines. It is better to rehearse the lines several times than to memorize a paragraph of lines by rote. The roles in the same scene can inspire each other through rehearsing the lines, and rehearsing the lines can play a role in communication and stimulation; the meaning and emotion of a sentence can be grasped more thoroughly, then the degree of high and low, fast and slow will inevitably be grasped more accurately, the tone is accurate, and the content can be expressed appropriately.
    Literary language is processed living language, and similarly, the actor's lines should also be processed conversations from life. In life, when two people talk, it is enough for the other person to hear, but when two people talk on stage, even if it is a whisper, it must be considered whether the audience in the last row can hear it. To make the audience in the last row hear it, and also to express it as a whisper, you must use breathy sounds to achieve the artistic effect. Using breathy sounds is a technique. Technique can be exercised.
    Spoken drama actors rely on speaking. If they do not speak well, and cannot explain the meaning of the words clearly, how can they be spoken drama actors?
    Articulation, pronunciation, breath control, and speed are all techniques. Only when you understand the character, study the character, and enter the character's creation, and when the technique of using language is transformed into the character's creative process, then the lines are not something attached to the actor, will not make the actor feel cumbersome, will not make the audience feel stiff, will not incur unwarranted accusations, but will be an indispensable artistic component of the character's creation, but will be an aspect of the character's expression, but will be an aspect of the character's action in the continuous action.
    The processing of lines is by no means dragging the tune. In the early stages of civilized drama, most of the actors were from the south. Southerners speaking the northern dialect inevitably formed a tone; early spoken drama actors, one-sidedly emphasizing exaggeration, had a formalistic performance tendency in the recitation of lines. Today's spoken drama actors basically do not have the above two symptoms. Since liberation, advocating starting from life and starting from characters, the realistic performance method has become the mainstream. The achievements of the spoken drama movement in the decade since liberation should be affirmed. Starting from life may breed a tendency toward naturalistic performance, which should be guarded against. At the same time, when performing historical dramas, a certain degree of exaggeration is also needed in the recitation of lines. This exaggeration also belongs to the scope of line processing.
    The above are my personal feelings and hopes for the literary language of drama and the actor's lines. I think my personal feelings and hopes have a mass basis.

    对话和台词
    余文
    舞台艺术的基础是文学剧本，文学剧本的基础是文学语言，一般称之为对话或台词。戏剧性的动作要从台词里去挖掘，而人物性格的刻划，也必须借助文学语言来表达。许多著名的剧本，整段的词人们都可以背诵流传开来；有些名剧不只是留传下典型的人物形象，同时随着人物的光辉形象也留下些诗一般的文学语言或是警句名言。莎士比亚的哈孟雷特是喜好戏剧文学的人所熟知的人物之一，最代表哈孟雷特性格特征的那句台词：“生存还是毁灭”？（见朱生豪译本。）已被用为对犹豫不决的人的讽刺性的评语。
    文学语言的创造和运用，不同的作者有不同的习惯和爱好，所以一些知名的剧作家都有他自己的风格。有以精练见长，有以豪迈见长，有以细腻见长，有以幽默见长。田汉的作品就不同于老舍的，读到夏衍的作品绝不会误以为是曹禺的。
    戏剧不止于是阅读，主要是为了演出，因此作家的风格要结合演出实践才能完满地完成的。演出不同作家的作品得掌握不同作家的特点。总的艺术调度是导演的责任，可是就角色创造来说，演员必须从理解作家的风格入手来研究作家和他的作品。
    许多学习写作的青年剧作者，当然还未能形成自己的独特风格。能不能形成自己的风格是另一问题，首先要掌握的是如何运用文学语言来塑造典型人物，并且要写出戏来的问题。
    典型人物的塑造不只是语言这个问题，不过语言是否做到性格化，语言是否富于戏剧性的动作却是典型人物塑造的关键。因而想就语言这个问题谈点粗浅的看法。
    我们常常读到这样一些剧本，或者看到这样的一些演出，情节故事倒也还引人入胜，可是观众和读者却禁不住要失去耐性，为什么？就因为某些事件在剧情进展上并没有特殊意义，可是却让人物不厌其详地重复又重复，交代又交代；或者某些事件几句话就足够了，可是作者却写上十几句甚或几十句。这时候，观众和读者同样会失去耐性的。注意，这里并非在提倡简单化，只要是从人物出发，那怕长篇演讲也必然会受到欢迎，“红色风暴”里的施洋这个人物不就是个例子么？问题也就在是不是从人物出发的，是不是从规定情景出发的。人们所以失去耐性就在于不合情理，所以不可信，也就是没有戏。
    戏剧语言来自生活，可是照抄生活中的语言并不等于是戏。来自生活的语言用在戏里需要一个过程，也就是提炼和加工的过程。我们要生活化的语言，但是这种生活化的语言是在生活的基础上经过加工和提炼了的；只有加工和提炼了的语言才是文学语言。
    至于新编的戏曲和歌剧，那就更有一个唱词的问题了。要唱得上口有感情，富有抒情意味的词应该是诗。文学语言应该是诗的语言。目前有些戏曲和歌剧的唱词不这么理想，戏曲里陈词滥调还未清除，新歌剧又常是唱不上口，因为既不合辙又不压韵。有时唱词和对话内容重复。这就更难责怪观众没有耐性了。
    有人说好的电影对话极少，甚至少到没有对话；又有人说演契呵夫的戏过瘾，因为有潜台词可挖。如果少到对话都没有了那是哑剧，不是话剧，契呵夫的戏也不是人人喜欢演、喜欢看的。风格应是多种多样的，不宜只提倡某一种，因为群众不会满足于一种形式、一种风格。不过，戏剧的文学语言应该富有动作性，应该有潜台词可挖，应该给演员留出余地，使演员有戏可做，同时也要为观众留出想像的余地。所谓过犹不及吧，艺术贵在含蓄。所以电影的表现手法，和契呵夫的手法都是应该学习的，学习不是模仿，学习的目的也在那个“化”字上。
    剧本的文学语言加工的不够，会给演员带来很大的苦恼；台词不够生活化、性格化，叫演员如何创造出活生生的人物形象来呢？不论是现代剧、历史剧或是外国戏，台词不上口，首先就妨碍了演员的创造情绪，更别说要从台词里挖掘内心动作，塑造出典型的人物形象了。
    演员的苦恼对剧作者提出了要求，可是，让我们也听听剧作者的意见吧！有的作家在抱怨，抱怨演员在台词上没能下工夫，不是吃了字；就是轻重音咬的不是地方。台词的意思不对头，于是应有的效果也就出不来了。观众在这一点上是同情作家的。
    演员的台词也是一个普遍的值得注意的问题。
    据说目前有的剧院排戏，很少对词。有的演员虽不是过目能诵，但都有强记的本领，拿到剧本不几天，一上排演场，就可以丢本子了。词是背下来了，可就是没有“化”。这句话为什么这样说？他说这个是什么意思呢？想一想就有潜台词可挖了，可惜想的时间不多。忙呀！几天排一场，不几天就要演了，戏得抢。这样的情况又怎能抱怨演员呢？行政上对时间的安排是另一问题，这里且不谈，对演员说来，不论时间多么紧，一定要争取对词。死背一段词不如多对几遍词。同一场戏的角色，通过对词可以互相启发，对词可以起交流、刺激的作用；一句话的含义、感情，可以捉摸的透一些，那末高低、快慢的分寸也必然掌握得准确些，语气准确了，内容也就能恰如其份地表达出来了。
    文学语言是加工的生活语言，同样，演员的台词也应该是加工的生活中的谈话。生活中两人讲话，只要对方听得见就行了，可是在台上两人讲话，即令是耳语吧，也要考虑到台下最后一排观众听不听的到。要最后一排观众听的到，又要表现是耳语，就必须用气音才能达到艺术的效果。运用气音是技术。技术是可以锻炼的。
    话剧演员就靠说话，话说的不好，说不清话的意思，又怎么能做话剧演员呢？
    咬字、吐音、运气，以及快慢等等都是技术。只有理解了人物，研究了人物，进入了人物创造的时候，运用语言的技巧化进了人物创造过程中，那时候，台词才不是附加在演员身上的东西，不会使演员感到累赘，不会使观众感到生硬，不会招致不该有的指责，而是角色创造过程中不可少的一个艺术组成部分，而是人物性格表现的一个方面，而是角色贯串动作中行动的一面。
    台词的加工绝不是拖腔拉调，初期文明戏的演员多是南方人，南人说北话，势必形成一种腔调；早期话剧演员，片面的强调夸张，台词念白上存在过形式主义的表演倾向。今天的话剧演员，基本上并没有上述两种病症，解放以来，提倡从生活出发，从人物出发，现实主义的表演方法形成为主流，解放十年来话剧运动的成绩是应该肯定的。从生活出发可能滋生自然主义表演的倾向，这是应该警惕的。同时，演历史剧，念白上也需要一定的夸张。这个夸张也是属于台词加工的范畴。
    以上是我个人对戏剧的文学语言和演员的台词一点感想和希望，我想我个人的这一点感想和希望是有群众基础的。
