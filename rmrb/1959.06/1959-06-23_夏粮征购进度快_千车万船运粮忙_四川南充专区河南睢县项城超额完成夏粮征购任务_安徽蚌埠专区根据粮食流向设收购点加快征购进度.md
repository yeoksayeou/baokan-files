Summer Grain Procurement Progresses Rapidly: Thousands of Vehicles and Boats Busy Transporting Grain
Sichuan Nanchong Special District, Henan Suixian, and Xiangcheng Exceed Summer Grain Procurement Targets
Anhui Bengbu Special District Sets Up Purchasing Stations Based on Grain Flow to Accelerate Procurement Progress

This newspaper, Nanchong, June 22nd—The Sichuan Province Nanchong Special District has completed its summer grain procurement task. In the past half-month, on the main roads and small paths of Nanchong Special District, thousands of vehicles and tens of thousands of burdens were on the move, and on the Jialing River, a thousand sails raced forward. In just ten days, grain stored in warehouses reached 275 million catties, with the storage speed doubling compared to the same period last year.

The rapid and high-quality summer grain storage in Nanchong Special District this year is inseparable from the fact that the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels took command, personally took action, grasped the work early and tightly, and correctly implemented the procurement policy of taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the commune members.

The summer grain procurement involves a large quantity, a tight schedule, and falls during the busy farming season. In order to ensure that production and procurement are not delayed, the entire district adopted the method of rapid harvesting, threshing, procurement, and warehousing, as well as simultaneous harvesting, threshing, procurement, and warehousing. Based on the weather conditions, labor was arranged flexibly. The specific method is to combine full-scale assault with opportunistic transport, using daytime production and nighttime grain transport, morning production and afternoon grain transport. When it rains, focus on planting sweet potatoes, and when it is sunny, shift to a concentrated grain transport effort, ensuring that batches are threshed, dried, and delivered, thus ensuring the rapid completion of the state's summer grain procurement task without delaying current production.

During the summer grain procurement period, farmers throughout the district were enthusiastic and engaged in competitions with each other, comparing speed and quality. The sound of gongs and drums filled the day, and lanterns and torches illuminated the night. At the purchasing station in Zao'er Township, Nanbu County, a grain transport team composed of thirty young women led by Zhang Xiuqing delivered more than 15,000 catties of grain in one night. They said in unison: "We don't forget the Party in the face of a good harvest, we dry and clean the grain before sending it to the granary, we only think about getting the grain into storage, and we don't care if our clothes are soaked with sweat."

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 21st—The progress of summer grain procurement and storage in Henan Province is accelerating. Starting from the 16th, the amount of grain procured and stored in the province each day reached more than 200 million catties; by the 18th, 22.55% of the summer grain procurement plan had been completed, exceeding the level of the same period last year. Suixian County, Xiangcheng, and Luohe City have already exceeded their procurement targets.

Now the wheat harvest has ended throughout the province, and the vast areas are threshing day and night while organizing farmers to send grain to warehouses. In Dancheng County, while celebrating the first summer harvest after communization, the communes organized 130,000 young and strong laborers into a loading and transporting task force, and from the 13th to the 15th, they completed more than 46% of the delivery task. After inspection, more than 99% of the grain delivered was of good quality.

In order to ensure the quality of the grain, a mass movement to dry and air the grain is underway in various places. In Changge County, 160,000 people dry and air the grain every day, and the masses voluntarily provide mats and other tools to prevent the grain from coming into contact with the ground. The Changge County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized eleven roving inspection teams, and the communes and teams also organized 420 inspection teams to be responsible for inspecting the quality of the grain. Qualified grain is immediately stored, and unqualified grain is dried and aired again.

Grain departments in various parts of the province have set up 2,354 purchasing stations and transfer stations along transportation lines and in areas where grain is concentrated. Each purchasing station is equipped with tea, a medical station, and a rest shed for the convenience of farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 21st—The Bengbu Special District in Anhui Province has taken measures in various aspects to solve the problem of labor for grain delivery, accelerating the progress of summer grain procurement and transfer, so that both procurement work and summer production are not delayed.

At present, the Bengbu Special District is busy with summer production, and at the same time, it must complete the grain procurement task in a timely manner. Party and government leaders in the special district, relevant departments, and people's communes have taken measures in many aspects to solve the problem of insufficient labor for grain delivery.

People's communes in various places in the special district are making full use of the night to rush grain delivery, and are paying attention to improving the tools for transporting grain. Many places use vehicles to transport grain, which improves transportation efficiency.

In addition to the original 534 grain purchasing points in the entire special district, 185 grain purchasing points have been added along railways, highways, and waterways, based on the direction of grain circulation and the principle of facilitating farmers, so that grain that needs to be collected and transferred can be centrally transported to transportation lines at one time, reducing the grain collection and transportation links and shortening the distance that farmers have to travel to deliver grain. In Dingyuan County, the addition of eighteen purchasing points along transportation lines has shortened the distance that farmers have to travel to deliver grain, which is estimated to save farmers about 30,000 labor days in summer grain storage. The grain departments actively strengthen contact with the communes, specifically arrange the location for grain delivery, and make appointments for grain delivery times in advance to avoid congestion and delays.

    夏粮征购进度快　千车万船运粮忙
    四川南充专区河南睢县项城超额完成夏粮征购任务
    安徽蚌埠专区根据粮食流向设收购点加快征购进度
    本报南充22日电　四川省南充专区夏粮征购任务已经完成。近半个多月来，南充专区各县大道小路千车万担，嘉陵江上千帆齐发，前后十天时间，入库粮食达二亿七千五百万斤，入库速度比去年同期加快了两倍。
    南充专区今年夏粮入库又快又好，与各级党委书记挂帅，亲自动手，抓得早，抓得紧，正确贯彻了国家、集体、社员统筹兼顾的征购政策分不开的。
    夏粮征购数量大、时间紧，又在农事繁忙季节。为了保证生产、征购两不误，全区采取了快收、快打、快征购、快入库和边收、边打、边征购、边入库的办法，根据天气晴雨，灵活安排劳力。具体作法是，全力突击与抽空抢运相结合，运用白天生产、晚上运粮，上午生产、下午运粮，天雨全力栽插红苕，天晴就转入突击运粮等办法，做到打一批，晒一批，交一批，既保证了国家夏粮征购任务的迅速完成，又不耽误当前生产。
    在夏粮征购期间，全区农民热情洋溢，相互开展竞赛，比快比好。白天锣鼓喧天，入夜灯笼火把齐明。在南部县枣儿乡的收购点上，由张秀清等三十个青年妇女组成的运粮小组，一晚就送了一万五千多斤粮食。她们异口同声地说：“粮食丰收不忘党，晒干扬净送进仓，一心只想粮入库，哪管汗珠湿衣裳”。

    据新华社郑州21日电　河南省夏粮征购入库进度加快。从16日开始，全省每天征购入库的粮食达到二亿多斤；到18日止，已完成夏粮征购计划的22.55％，超过去年同期的水平。睢县、项城、漯河市三县、市已经超额完成征购任务。
    现在全省小麦收割已经结束，广大地区正一面日夜不停地打场脱粒，一面组织农民送粮入库。郸城县各公社在庆贺公社化后第一个夏季大丰收的同时，组织十三万名青壮年成立了装运突击队，从13日到15日就完成交售任务46％以上，交售的粮食经过检验，99％以上是好粮。
    为了保证粮食质量，各地都掀起群众性的整晒粮食的运动。长葛县每天有十六万人整晒粮食，群众自动拿出席子等晒粮工具，使粮食不与地面接触。中共长葛县委组织了十一个巡回检查组，各社、队也组织四百二十个检查组，负责检查粮质，合格的立即入库，不合格的重新整晒。
    全省各地粮食部门在交通沿线和交粮集中的地区，设立收购站和转运站二千三百五十四处，每个收购站都备有茶水、医疗站和休息棚，便利农民。
    据新华社合肥21日电　安徽省蚌埠专区从各方面采取措施解决送粮劳力问题，加快了夏粮征购、调运进度，使征购工作和夏季生产两不误。
    目前，蚌埠专区正忙于夏季生产，同时要及时完成粮食征购任务，专区党政领导、各有关部门和人民公社都从多方面采取措施，解决送粮劳动力不足的问题。
    专区各地人民公社都充分利用夜晚突击送粮，并注意改善运粮的工具，很多地方用车子送粮，提高了运输效率。
    全专区除原有的五百三十四个粮食收购点以外，根据粮食流转方向和便利农民的原则，在铁路、公路、河道沿线增设了一百八十五个粮食收购点，使需要收调的粮食一次集运到交通沿线，减少了粮食集运环节，还缩短了农民的送粮里程。定远县由于在交通沿线增设了十八个收购点，缩短了农民的送粮里程，在夏粮入库中大约可使农民节省三万个劳动日。粮食部门主动和公社加强联系，具体安排送粮地点，预先约好送粮时间，避免送粮时拥挤以致耽误时间。
