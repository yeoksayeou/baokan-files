    Zhejiang Leading Cadres at All Levels
    Lead the Masses in Re-threshing Summer Crops
    Weinan County, Shaanxi Province Organizes Professional Teams to Collect Scattered Wheat Ears
    (Our dispatch from Hangzhou, June 16) Zhejiang is re-threshing the harvested summer crops to ensure a meticulous harvest. In the half-month period from May 23 to June 6, one million mu of wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and peas were re-harvested and re-threshed once throughout the province, recovering a total of more than 6,520,000 jin of grain, rapeseed, and beans.
    The CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee attaches great importance to the re-threshing and re-harvesting of spring crops. Since late May, the Provincial Committee has repeatedly instructed local Party committees to fully mobilize the masses and adopt various methods suited to local conditions to do a good job in meticulous harvesting and ensuring that every grain returns to the household. Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Lin Hujia and Li Fengping, Secretaries of the Secretariat, all went to production teams to participate in and inspect the re-harvesting of spring crops. Ten prefectural committee secretaries, one hundred and forty-four county committee secretaries, and more than ten thousand commune party committee secretaries and brigade branch secretaries participated in the re-harvesting work, leading the vast number of cadres and commune members in re-checking and meticulous threshing.
    Currently, the re-threshing and re-harvesting of spring crops in Zhejiang Province is still continuing.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 15) After the wheat harvest was basically completed, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, immediately launched a mass movement for a second wheat gathering. From June 7 to 12, the county mobilized more than 40,000 people, recovering more than 2,150,000 jin of wheat stalks, more than 1,070,000 jin of wheat ears, and sweeping up 240,000 jin of wheat grains, which can be milled into more than 1,900,000 jin of wheat.
    In order to ensure a bumper harvest, Weinan County organized students and auxiliary laborers to conduct the second wheat gathering. Localities universally convened field meetings, using the method of detailed accounting to educate the masses on ensuring that every grain returns to the household and achieving a bumper harvest. At the same time, professional wheat-gathering teams or groups were organized to take responsibility for designated areas, first gathering the land that was to be planted with autumn crops and then gathering idle land. During wheat gathering, all localities ensured that the fields were clean, the roads were clean, the edges of villages were clean, and the edges of threshing grounds were clean.

    陕西渭南县组织专业队搜集散失麦穗
    本报杭州16日电　浙江各地对已经收割脱粒的夏熟作物，正重新进行复打细收。从5月23日到6月6日半个月中，全省已有一百万亩大小麦、油菜和蚕、豌豆复收重打一次，共收回粮食、菜籽和豆类六百五十二万多斤。
    中共浙江省委十分重视春花重打复收工作。5月下旬以来，省委多次指示各地党委充分发动群众，因地制宜地采取各种各样办法，做好细收细打、颗粒还家工作。省委第一书记江华、书记处书记林乎加、李丰平都到生产队参加和检查春花重收复打。全省先后有地委书记十人、县委书记一百四十四人和公社党委书记、大队的支部书记一万多人，参加了复收重打工作，带动广大干部和社员复查细打。
    目前浙江省春花复打复收工作还在继续开展。
    据新华社西安15日电　陕西渭南县在小麦基本上收完以后，立即开展群众性的第二次拾麦运动。从6月7日到12日，全县共出动四万多人，拾回麦株二百十五万多斤、麦穗一百零七万多斤，扫回麦颗二十四万斤，以上共可碾麦子一百九十多万斤。
    为了确保丰产丰收，渭南县各地组织了学生和辅助劳力进行第二次拾麦。各地普遍地召开地头会议，用算细账的办法对群众进行颗粒还家、丰产丰收的教育。同时组织拾麦专业队或专业组，划片包干，先拾马上要种秋的地，后拾休闲地。拾麦中，各地都做到地里净，道路净，村边净，场边净。
