Mongolian Pastoral Areas After Cooperativization
By Our Correspondent Féng Yè

	Merger of Sumu and Cooperative
    Recently, we visited Bulgan Province, one of the provinces in Mongolia with a relatively rapid development of pastoral cooperativization. In January this year, two months before the nationwide announcement of the basic realization of cooperativization, the province had already achieved complete cooperativization.
    Bulgan Province is located in northern Mongolia, more than 300 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar, and can be reached by car in one day.
    On the second day of our arrival in Bulgan City, the capital of Bulgan Province, Comrade Lamuhu, Chairman of the Provincial People's Representative Hural Executive Committee (Governor), received us. He told us that with the realization of cooperativization throughout the province, the provincial administrative organs had also undergone changes. These days, they are busy adjusting the work of the administrative organs. In order to consolidate the cooperatives, strengthen the leadership of the Sumu (county) over the cooperatives, enable the Sumu cadres to go deep into the lower levels, and at the same time, streamline the institutions to better suit the current situation, they decided to merge the Sumu administrative organs and the cooperatives, making the "Sumu-Cooperative" both an administrative and an economic basic unit. The original administrative unit Bage (township) below the Sumu level has lost its significance and it has been decided to abolish it.
    The Chairman of the Provincial Executive Committee said that previously, the province had a total of fourteen Sumu and seventy-nine Bage, now changed to twenty-six "Sumu-Cooperatives." The province has streamlined more than two hundred people, who have been assigned to cooperatives to help the cooperatives develop and consolidate. More than sixty of these more than two hundred office cadres are members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, some of whom are leading cadres, such as the former Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the former Chairman of the Provincial Executive Committee, who respectively serve as leaders of the cooperatives. Other cadres at the provincial, Sumu and Bage levels have also joined the production teams of the cooperatives to participate in production.
    Mongolian herdsmen had automatically established a cooperative named "Lenin's Road" as early as 1930. The accelerated development of cooperativization has mainly been in recent years, especially in March last year, when the Thirteenth Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party made a resolution requiring most herdsmen to join cooperatives by 1960. This resolution greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of herdsmen to join the cooperatives. At that time, only 49% of the herdsmen in the province had joined the cooperatives, and in just over half a year, the province achieved cooperativization.

	Why Did It Develop So Fast
    Why did the cooperatives develop so fast all of a sudden? The Chairman of the Provincial Executive Committee analyzed this question. He told us that after the Thirteenth Congress of the Party, the leaders of the province went deep into the pastoral areas to convey the spirit of the Congress's resolutions. The herdsmen were educated and automatically proposed guarantees that they would take practical actions to implement the Party's resolutions. At the same time, the Party and government organs at the provincial level took corresponding measures, first consolidating the existing cooperatives, so that the cooperatives showed superiority in both organization and economy, and summarized the experience of some better cooperatives and promoted them throughout the province. The herdsmen further saw the benefits of the cooperatives, and their enthusiasm for joining the cooperatives was further enhanced.
    On the other hand, the Party and government organized various meetings, absorbing people from all walks of life to participate, and fully discussed ways to increase production and improve people's living standards. After debate, everyone became more clear about the significance and role of cooperativization. Secondly, the Party also educated the members of the existing cooperatives, requiring them to pay attention to strengthening the connection with non-members. The members cared about the production and life of non-members, and used their own personal experiences to help non-members improve their understanding. The herdsmen have long been familiar with their own production situation and existing problems, and they have become increasingly clear about the development prospects of the cooperatives. When conditions are ripe, the climax of cooperativization comes.
    It is now the first harvest season after cooperativization. This year, the province is preparing to deliver 400,000 head of lambs, and the tens of thousands of young lambs that the herdsmen have already delivered are healthy and have not suffered any losses. The Chairman of the Provincial Executive Committee said that the smooth delivery and growth of young lambs are related to the completion of the annual livestock breeding plan. The herdsmen are confident that they will overfulfill this year's livestock breeding plan.
    In order to better develop animal husbandry, the province attaches special importance to agricultural production this year. The sown area of agriculture will be greatly increased compared with last year, and it is planned to sow 25,000 hectares of cultivated land. Mongolia's first flour processing factory was established in the provincial capital of this province. Strengthening agricultural production can not only meet the raw material needs of the flour factory, but also cultivate feed and develop livestock. In the past, agricultural production was mainly operated by state farms and ranches. This year, the area of grain and vegetables cultivated by cooperatives has also increased compared with previous years.

	Four Years of Change in a Cooperative
    That afternoon, we visited the "Labor Sumu-Cooperative," 60 kilometers from the provincial capital.
    Comrade Labugedorji, the Sumu Chairman and Cooperative Director, was originally the Second Secretary of Bulgan Province. In 1955, he volunteered to come down to lead this cooperative. He described to us the changes in the "Labor Sumu-Cooperative" in the past four years.
    In 1955, there were only a few wooden houses and several Mongolian yurts in the location of the cooperative. The cooperative had more than 300 members and more than 16,000 head of livestock. In May of that year, several tents were set up on the square to hold a members' meeting, and a gust of wind blew down the tents. In 1956, the director led eight members to build a red entertainment room, which solved the needs of meetings and cultural entertainment. Now, the cooperative headquarters has become completely different from before. Offices, schools, power stations, garages, and some dormitories have been built. It has become the center for herdsmen to settle down.
    In 1955, 60% of the herdsmen around the cooperative had not joined the cooperative. They were not accustomed to collective production and life, and it was still difficult to absorb them into the cooperative. However, the cooperative's production increased year after year, and the members' lives improved day by day. The individual herdsmen around saw these obvious changes, and the number of people who volunteered to join the cooperative increased day by day. In March 1958, during the Thirteenth Congress of the Party, 62% of the herdsmen in the entire Sumu (county) had joined the cooperative; by the end of the year, the entire Sumu had implemented cooperativization. At the beginning of this year, the Sumu organization and the cooperative merged into one. Now, the entire "Labor Sumu-Cooperative" has a total of 535 members, totaling 1,488 people. The members have a total of 52,000 head of livestock, including those that joined the cooperative and those that were self-retained.
    In 1958, while the cooperative was developing rapidly, the production tasks were completed well, fully demonstrating the power of collectivization. They completed the livestock breeding number of the original three-year plan of 1958-1960 in one year. At the same time, they overfulfilled the annual plan for handing over livestock products such as wool and cashmere to the state by 6%-27%, and received a reward of 43,000 tugriks from the state.
    In 1958, the cooperative began to plant grains and vegetables, and the members ate the radishes and potatoes they grew themselves. The members also carried out sideline production such as construction and wood processing. The total annual income of the cooperative reached 446,000 tugriks. The cash income of each labor day of the members was three tugriks, and the income of meat, milk and other physical objects also increased.
    This year, the cooperative will purely increase more than 6,000 head of livestock. The sown area of agriculture will increase from 32 hectares last year to 300 hectares. It is also necessary to continue to build shops and bathrooms in the center of the cooperative, and build livestock sheds and fences. The annual planned income is 600,000 tugriks.
    Now, all the young lambs produced by the cooperative have survived, and the condition of the maternal animals is also very good. The director pointed to the fresh yogurt that he asked us to drink and said that in previous years, due to natural conditions and labor constraints, fresh yogurt was not made in time. This year, it was made a month earlier, and the members' lives have also been improved earlier.
    When he talked about the situation after the merger of the Sumu administrative organization and the cooperative, he said that he has not been in the position of Sumu Chairman and Cooperative Director for long, and he feels that this organizational form is very streamlined and suitable. The administrative organization has been streamlined; on the other hand, the strength of the production team has been enhanced. He said that the bureaucratic work style of the leadership can also be overcome, better go deep down, and organize production.

	Life is Getting Better and Better
    The director also happily accompanied us to visit the members of the production team a few miles away. We came to the door of the home of Batu Suhe, a member of the animal husbandry production team. The young member Batu Suhe and his wife were driving the sheep into the enclosure. The strong lambs were calling and jumping with the ewes.
    The host let us into the yurt, and again hot tea, again yogurt, and cordially entertained us. Batu Suhe told us that the flock of sheep he grazed had produced 450 lambs, all of which survived. Last year, they husband and wife worked more than 1,100 labor days in total, and received more than 3,000 tugriks in cash income alone. Because of their remarkable labor achievements, the cooperative also awarded a radio. Now, the radio is broadcasting music programs broadcast by Ulaanbaatar, and the yurt is even more lively.
    Batu Suhe's mother-in-law came in. This old man in her sixties is still very healthy. She had experienced hard times in the past. After the victory of the revolution, life became better, and she learned the new Mongolian script. Batu Suhe's family subscribes to the Mongolian "Truth Daily," "Youth Truth Daily," and "Party Life" magazine. Life is getting better and better. (Attached picture)

    合作化后的蒙古牧区
    本报记者　逢烨
        苏木和合作社合并
    最近我们访问了布拉干省。这个省是蒙古牧业合作化发展较快的省份之一。今年1月间，在全国宣布基本实现合作化前两个月，这个省就全部合作化了。
    布拉干省在蒙古北部，离乌兰巴托三百多公里，坐汽车一天就到了。
    到布拉干省会——布拉干市的第二天，省人民代表呼拉尔执行局主席（省长）拉木护同志接见了我们。他告诉我们，随着全省实现了合作化，省行政机构也发生了变化。这些日子，他们正在忙于调整行政机构工作。为了巩固合作社，加强苏木（县）对合作社的领导，使苏木干部深入下层，同时，把机构精简得更适合于当前的情况，他们决定把苏木行政机构和合作社合并，使“苏木—合作社”成为既是行政的，同时又是经济的基层单位。原苏木下一级的行政单位巴戈（乡），已经失去意义，决定予以撤消。
    省执行局主席同志说，以前，全省共有十四个苏木，七十九个巴戈，现在改为二十六个“苏木—合作社”。全省共精简了二百多人，都分配到合作社去，帮助合作社发展和巩固。这二百多名机关干部，有六十多人是蒙古人民革命党的党员，其中有一些是领导干部，例如原省党委的副书记和原省执行局主席等，都分别担任合作社的领导工作。省级、苏木和巴戈的其他干部，也都到合作社的生产队参加生产。
    布拉干省牧民，早在1930年就自动建立过一个命名为“列宁之路”的合作社。合作化的加速发展，主要是在最近几年。特别是在去年3月，蒙古人民革命党的第十三次代表大会作出决议，要求到1960年大部分牧民加入合作社。这个决议大大鼓舞了牧民入社的积极性。当时，全省只有49％的牧户入社，只半年多一点时间，全省就实现了合作化。
        为什么发展这样快
    为什么合作社一下子发展得那么快呢？省执行局主席同志对这个问题作了分析。他告诉我们，党的十三次代表大会结束后，省的领导人就分别深入牧区，传达大会的决议精神。牧民们受到了教育，自动提出保证，一定要以实际行动来实现党的决议。同时，省的党政机关，采取了相应的措施，首先巩固现有的合作社，使合作社在组织上和经济上都显示出优越性，并总结一些较好的合作社的经验，向全省推广。牧民们进一步看到合作社的好处，入社的积极性更加提高了。
    另一方面，党和政府曾组织各种会议，吸收各阶层人民来参加，充分讨论增加生产和提高人民生活水平的方法。经过辩论，大家更加明确合作化的意义和作用。其次，党还教育现有合作社的社员，要求他们注意加强和非社员的联系。社员们关心非社员的生产和生活，用他们自己的亲身经历来帮助非社员提高认识。牧民们长时期以来对于自己的生产情况和存在的问题是熟知的，他们对合作社的发展前途，越来越看得清楚了。瓜熟蒂落，合作化的高潮就这样来到了。
    目前正是合作化后的第一个丰收季节。今年全省准备接羔四十万头，牧民们已接下的几万头幼羔，身体健壮，没有什么损失。省执行局主席说，幼羔的顺利接产、成长，关系到全年牲畜增殖计划的完成。牧民们都有信心要超额完成今年的牲畜增殖计划。
    为了更好地发展牧业，今年全省特别重视农业生产。农业的播种面积将比去年大大增加，准备播种耕地二万五千公顷。蒙古的第一个面粉加工厂就建立在这个省的省会，加强农业生产，不仅可以满足面粉厂的原料需要，还可以栽培饲料，发展牲畜。过去，农业生产主要是由农牧场经营的，今年，合作社耕种的谷物和蔬菜面积，也比往年增多了。
        一个社四年的变化
    当天下午，我们到距离省会六十公里的“劳动苏木—合作社”参观访问。
    苏木主席兼合作社社长拉布格道尔吉同志原是布拉干省的第二书记。1955年，他自愿下来领导这个合作社。他给我们描绘了“劳动苏木—合作社”四年来的变化。
    1955年，合作社所在地只有几间木屋和几个蒙古包，全社有三百多户社员，一万六千多头牲畜。那年5月间，曾在广场上搭起几个帐篷，召开社员大会，一阵大风把帐篷吹倒了。1956年，社长带领八个社员修建了一所红色娱乐室，解决了开会和文化娱乐的需要。现在，合作社社址变得和以前完全不同了。办公室、学校、发电站、汽车库以及部分宿舍都修建起来了。这里已经成为牧民们定居的中心。
    1955年，合作社周围60％的牧户没有入社，他们不习惯集体的生产和生活，吸收他们入社还有困难。但是，合作社连年增产，社员生活日益改善，周围的个体牧民看到了这些明显的变化，自愿入社的人一天天增多起来。1958年3月，即党的十三次代表大会期间，全苏木（县）已有62％的牧户入社；年底，全苏木实行了合作化。今年初，苏木机构和合作社合而为一。现在，整个“劳动苏木—合作社”共有五百三十五户社员，计一千四百八十八人。社员入社和自留牲畜共五万二千头。
    1958年，在合作社大发展的同时，生产任务完成得很好，充分显示了集体化的力量。他们在一年内就完成了原1958—1960年的三年计划的牲畜增殖数。同时，超额6％—27％完成了上交国家的毛、绒等畜产品的年度计划，得到国家四万三千图格里克的奖励。
    1958年，合作社开始种植谷物和蔬菜，社员们吃到了自己种植的萝卜和土豆。社员们还进行了建筑、木材加工等副业生产。全社一年的总收入达到四十四万六千图格里克。社员的每一个劳动日的现金收入是三图格里克，肉、奶等实物收入也增多了。
    今年，全社将纯增六千多头牲畜。农业的播种面积要从去年的三十二公顷增加到三百公顷。还要继续在社的中心地修盖商店和浴室，修盖牲畜棚、圈。全年计划收入六十万图格里克。
    现在，全社接产的幼羔全部成活，母畜膘肥也很好。社长同志指着请我们喝的新鲜酸奶子说，往年受自然条件和人力的限制，新鲜酸奶子还来不及制作，今年提早了一个月，社员们的生活也早得到改善。
    他谈到苏木行政机构和合作社合一后的情况时说，他担任苏木主席兼社长的职务不久，感到这个组织形式很精练，很合适。行政机构精简了；另方面，生产队的力量增强了。他说，领导的官僚主义作风也可以得到克服，更好地深入下去，组织生产。
        日子越过越好了
    社长同志还高兴地陪同我们到几里外的生产队去访问社员。我们来到牧业生产队员巴特苏和的家门前，年青的社员巴特苏和同他的妻子正在把羊赶到圈里去，健壮的羊羔叫唤着，随着母羊蹦跳。
    主人把我们让到蒙古包里去，又是热茶，又是酸奶子，殷勤地招待我们。巴特苏和告诉我们，他放牧的羊群，已经接羔四百五十只，只只成活。去年，他们夫妻两人共作一千一百多个劳动日，仅现金收入就得到三千多图格里克，因为他们的劳动成绩显著，社里还奖给一台收音机。现在，收音机正传出乌兰巴托播送的音乐节目，蒙古包里更显得热闹了。
    巴特苏和的岳母进来了，这位六十多岁的老人，身体还很健康。她过去曾经历过艰苦的岁月，革命胜利后，生活变好了，她学习了新蒙文。巴特苏和家里订阅着蒙古“真理报”、“青年真理报”和“党的生活”杂志。日子越过越好了。（附图片）
