Farewell to Northern Shaanxi
——Excerpt from the fourth part of the long poem "The Cart Driver's Tale," entitled "Chairman Mao"
Tian Jian

The Yellow River comes from the heavens, its waves bursting from the gates of heaven. The gates of heaven are in Kunlun, the gates of heaven are at the zenith. Oh, vast Kunlun, Kunlun, you squander your youth. Your precious sword can only be handed over to a giant. People say on the banks of the Yellow River, there was once a heavenly axe. People say on the banks of the Yellow River, there once appeared a divine being. I want to ask Kunlun, where is this heavenly axe? I want to ask Kunlun, where is this divine being? The children of the Yellow River, now gallop like ten thousand horses. Yan'an has already been recovered, the bugles of the north and south sound in unison. Mountain singers, sing! Brothers, listen! A new paradise on earth, will surely be built on the summit of Kunlun.

  Sing, Yellow River,
  Smile, Yan'an,
  Sing, people,
  Smile, Kunlun.
  Giants, giants,
  Are advancing,
  Darkness flees,
  Light arrives.
  Kunlun, oh Kunlun,
  Five thousand years of blood and tears, you have transformed into,
  The drums of battle.
  Across the great river,
  Inside and outside the Great Wall,
  A red flag,
  Flying ten thousand miles.
Gales, storms, thunder, bid farewell to 1947; red flags, giants, cannons, welcome 1948. The Yellow River has long thawed, the willows have already sprouted green; willow branches sway in the air, the sky is clear and cloudless. Chairman Mao came to the riverbank, sitting on a rock, his body facing the Yellow River, his gaze fixed on Kunlun. Where he looks, there shall be light; where he looks, there shall be happiness. The Yellow River is like a golden snake, flying from the Kunlun Mountains, the Yellow River is a precious sword, its body full of gold. He will lean against the azure sky, draw this precious sword, cleave the snow-capped mountains open, and transform them into orioles of spring. Can snow-capped mountains, thousands of years old, still remain asleep? Now they should take flight, transforming into stars of peace. Hang yo, hang yo, hang yo, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, the boatman rows his boat, a wooden boat to welcome relatives. Hang yo—hang yo, hey ho—hey ho. The motherland is like a ship, Chairman Mao is the helmsman; the Chairman stands up, steadily stepping onto the bow. Soon he turns his face, looking at the heroic sons and daughters, looking at the blue sky and yellow earth, raising one of his hands. He raises his hand to heroic Northern Shaanxi, he raises his hand to the source of the revolution, he raises his hand high. Northern Shaanxi sees his hand, and the mountains raise their heads together, Kunlun sees his hand, and ice mountains ignite a fire. The Yellow River sees his hand, and the waves cease their footsteps, standing beside the leader, raising waves to cheer. The wind stops, the waves subside, the Chairman stands on the boat; waving once more towards Northern Shaanxi, towards the Yellow River. Then he approaches the boatman, greeting him as well; a smile on his face, grateful to this boatman. The boatman raises his eyes to look – this person seems familiar? The face is so familiar – seen before, definitely seen before! The boatman looks again, and he knows who it is—

  “Chairman, you old man, hello!” Only then did he utter these words.
  “China is a big ship, Chairman, you are the helmsman; we wish you health, we wish you longevity.” The Chairman returns the respect to the old boatman, wishing him longevity like an unaging pine: “We have boatmen, to be able to steer the ship, to row through wind and rain, to open a path on the waves.” Hang yo, hang yo, hang yo, the boatman rows with wooden oars; hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, the big ship moves forward. The Chairman sits on the boat, constantly turning his head back; looking at those plains, looking at those mountain peaks. The era is like a cart, passing through gales and storms. The Chairman is summoning, the cart rushes forward. Causing the counter-revolutionary wheels, to move towards the road of annihilation; causing these revolutionary wheels, to move towards the road of victory. "Dawn is just ahead, we must strive." The Chairman calls out like this, the Chairman instructs like this. He bids farewell to Northern Shaanxi, to go towards the Great Wall; he comes from the masses, he goes to the masses. Among us, he is the wisest; among us, he is the bravest. Advance, advance, advance, these are his footsteps; Long March, Long March, Long March, this is his life. He comes from Northern Shaanxi, he comes ashore from the Yellow River; the Yellow River is already behind him, ahead is the Great Wall. The Yellow River’s eight thousand miles of waves, are singing a farewell to the Chairman; the Great Wall’s ten thousand miles of wind and clouds, are also paying tribute to the leader. Chairman Mao’s gaze, is fixed on the Great Wall; Chairman Mao’s figure, has already fallen on the Great Wall. The sky shakes, the earth moves, wind and sand swirl on the Great Wall; our great leader, the kinsman of all nationalities, waves away the dark clouds with both hands, standing on the summit of ten thousand mountains. He brought the rosy clouds, he brought the stars, he brought freedom, he brought the order, he uses the arrow of Marxism, to pierce through the five-thousand-year-old city gates. He orders the Liberation Army, cannons firing in unison;
  Attack Nanjing,
  Liberate all of China; sweeping across the motherland, pursuing the enemy day and night! He orders a million troops, to march day and night; not allowing a single step of relaxation, not allowing a single step of stopping! He orders the sea to sing, he orders the earth to rise up, he orders the Yangtze River to build bridges, he orders the mountains to go to war! He calls on workers and peasants, he calls on miners and herdsmen, he calls on cart drivers and fishermen, he calls on professors and poets, to render meritorious service to the people, to dedicate themselves to the motherland! His gaze is as bright as fire, his steps are as steady as Mount Tai; his arms waving towards the sky, stepping onto the northern journey; dust on his clothes, wind and sand swirling on his shoulders. Six hundred million people’s footsteps, advance together with him; overthrowing two great mountains, welcoming the rising sun. He frightens the wild oxen, he exposes the monsters; "In the end, crushed under the mountain, never to turn over again"! At this moment, in the mountains, the sun is in motion, the red sun of the world, the sun is rising. The Yellow River’s eight thousand miles of waves, sing loudly a farewell; the Great Wall’s ten thousand miles of wind and clouds, fly over to welcome the giant!

[June 1959, written to commemorate the Party's birthday and welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. The complete poem "Chairman Mao" was published in the July issue of "Beijing Literature".]

    别陕北
    ——长诗“赶车传”第四部“毛主席”中的一段
    田间黄河来自天上，浪涛奔出天门。天门是在昆仑，天门是在天顶。莽昆仑呵昆仑，枉费你的青春。你的这把宝剑，只好交给巨人。人说黄河岸上，有过一把天斧。人说黄河岸上，出过一位神人。我要请问昆仑，哪有什么天斧？我要请问昆仑，哪有什么神人？黄河上的儿女，如今万马奔腾。延安已经收复，南北号角齐鸣。山歌手呀你唱，兄弟们呵请听。人间新的乐园，定要筑在昆仑山顶。
  唱吧，黄河，
  笑吧，延安，
  唱吧，人民，
  笑吧，昆仑。
  巨人，巨人，
  正在前进，
  黑暗逃遁，
  光明来临。
  昆仑呀昆仑，
  五千年血泪，你已经化为，
  战斗的鼓声。
  大河上下，
  长城内外，
  一杆红旗，
  万里飞腾。狂风、暴雨、雷鸣，送走1947年；红旗、巨人、炮声，迎来1948年。黄河早已解冻，柳树业已发青；柳枝摇在空中，晴空万里无云。毛主席来到河边，坐在一块石头上，身子对着黄河，目光望着昆仑。他所望的地方，那里就要光明；他所望的地方，那里就会幸福。黄河好像金蛇，昆仑山上飞来，黄河这是宝剑，满身都是黄金。他要倚着青天，抽出这把宝剑，要把雪山剖开，叫它变做春莺。几千年的雪山，还能沉睡不醒？如今应该起飞，变作和平之星。杭唷、杭唷、杭唷、嗨嗬、嗨嗬、嗨嗬、船夫划过船来，木船来接亲人。杭唷——杭唷，嗨嗬——嗨嗬。祖国呵好比是船，毛主席就是舵手；主席立起身来，稳步登上船头。不久他侧过脸来，望着英雄的儿女，望着蓝天和黄土，举起他的一只手。他向英雄的陕北，他把他的手举起，他向革命的源头，他把他的手高举。陕北看见他的手，群山一同抬起头，昆仑看见他的手，冰山升起一把火。黄河看见他的手，浪涛停止了脚步，站在领袖的身边，捧起浪花来欢呼。风停了，浪息了，主席站在船上；向陕北，向黄河，再一次招着手。接着他走近船夫，又向船夫来招呼；脸上露着笑容，感激这位船夫。船夫抬起眼看看——这人好像见过？面孔这样熟识——见过、一定是见过！船夫再定眼一看，他就知道是谁个——
  “主席你老人家好！”这时他才把话吐。
  “中国是一条大船，主席你就是舵手；我们祝你健康，我们祝你长寿。”主席回敬老梢公，祝他寿比不老松：—“我们有了船伕，才能把船开走，在风雨中摇橹，在浪涛上开路。”杭唷、杭唷、杭唷，船夫摇着木桨；嗨嗬、嗨嗬、嗨嗬，大船向前划去。主席坐在船上，不时回过头来；望着那些原野，望着那些山头。时代好像是车子，穿过狂风和暴雨。主席正在召唤，车子奔向前去。使那反革命车轮，走向复灭的道路；使这革命的车轮，走向胜利的道路。“曙光就在前面，我们应当努力。”主席这样号召，主席这样吩咐。他告别了陕北，要向长城走去；他从群众中来，他到群众中去。在我们这些人中，是最英明的一人；在我们这些人中，是最勇敢的一个。前进、前进、前进，这是他的脚步；长征、长征、长征，这是他的一生。他从陕北走来，他从黄河上岸；黄河已在背后，前面就是长城。黄河八千里浪涛，正在为主席送行；长城一万里风云，也在向领袖致敬。毛主席的目光，正在望着长城；毛主席的身影，已经落在长城。天在摇、地在动，长城上风砂滚滚；我们伟大的领袖，各个民族的亲人，双手挥去乌云，站在万山之顶。他带来了红霞，他带来了星星，他带来了自由，他带来了号令，他以马克思主义之
    箭，射穿五千年的城门。他命令解放大军，巨炮一齐轰鸣；
    打到南京去，
    解放全中国；横扫祖国大地，日夜追击敌人！他命令百万大军，日夜兼程前进；一步也不许放松，一步也不许停！他命令大海歌唱，他命令大地起身，他命令长江架桥，他命令群山出征！他号召工人农民，他号召矿工牧民，他号召车倌渔人，他号召教授诗人，要为人民立功，要为祖国献身！目光像火样通明，脚步比泰山还稳；手臂向天空挥着，踏上北方的征途；衣上带着灰尘，肩上风砂滚滚。六亿人的脚步，跟他一同前进；推倒两座大山，迎接旭日上升。他使野牛惊恐，他使怪物现形；“最后压倒在山底下，永世也不得翻身”！这时万山丛里，太阳正在运行，人间红的太阳，太阳呵正在上升。黄河八千里浪涛，高歌吧前来送行；长城一万里风云，飞来吧迎接巨人！
