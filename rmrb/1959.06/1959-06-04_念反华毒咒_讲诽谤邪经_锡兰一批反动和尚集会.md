Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 1st. A group of reactionary monks in Ceylon held a gathering here on May 31st, attempting to incite anti-China sentiment and advance their activities of interfering in China's internal affairs and opposing China.

This gathering had been planned for several weeks. It is reported that its funding was provided by the United National Party. The organizers had published large advertisements in the newspapers, making a great show of it, but the public expressed contempt for this gathering. Only about one hundred and eighty monks and approximately three hundred and fifty non-religious people attended the meeting. The most notable participants were former United National Party Interior Minister Ranayake, United National Party Member of Parliament Hurulle, and United National Party Youth League Vice Chairman Gunatilleke, among others.

Several monks made speeches at the meeting, fabricating so-called situations in Tibet and clamoring against China. In his speech, Gnanissara disguised his intentions by saying, "Their movement is purely to save Buddhism, and this movement does not belong to any party." He also said that he protested Prime Minister Bandaranaike's speech in Parliament on the Tibet issue.

The monk Sasanasiri made alarmist remarks, saying, "The Chinese will next attack India and then seize Ceylon." Another monk, Damatilleke, even clamored for the Ceylon Prime Minister to "get out."

This gathering passed an absurd resolution interfering in China's internal affairs, demanding a "convening of a world conference of Buddhists to pave the way for ceasefire negotiations between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Premier, thereby restoring Tibet to its previous status and ensuring religious freedom in China." The resolution even "demanded that Prime Minister Bandaranaike convene a meeting of all Asian national premiers" to "resolve" the Tibet issue, which is entirely China's internal affair. The resolution also clamored to "demand that the United Nations Organization investigate the crimes committed by the Communists in Tibet and restore this Buddhist country to its previous status."

### 念反华毒咒　讲诽谤邪经  锡兰一批反动和尚集会

    念反华毒咒　讲诽谤邪经
    锡兰一批反动和尚集会
    新华社科伦坡1日电　锡兰一批反动僧侣5月31日在这里举行集会，企图煽起敌视中国的情绪，推进他们干涉中国内政、反对中国的活动。
    这个集会已经筹备了好几个星期。据报道，它的经费是由统一国民党提供的。会议的组织者早在报上刊登了巨幅广告，大事吹擂，但是，公众对这个集会都表示轻蔑。出席这个集会的大概不过一百八十名僧侣和三百五十个左右的非宗教徒。最引人注目的参加者是前统一国民党内政部长拉纳雅克、统一国民党议员胡鲁累，统一国民党青年联盟副主席古纳提累克等人。
    会上有几个和尚发表讲话，胡乱编造所谓西藏的情况，叫嚷反对中国。格纳尼萨腊在他的讲话中掩饰说，“他们的运动纯粹是要挽救佛教，这个运动并不属于任何党派。”他还说，他抗议班达拉奈克总理在议会中关于西藏问题的发言。
    萨桑西里和尚危言耸听地说，
  “中国人下一步将进攻印度然后攫取锡兰。”另一个和尚达马提累克竟叫嚷要锡兰总理“滚蛋”。
    这个集会通过了一项干涉中国内政的荒谬决议，要求什么“召开佛教徒世界会议，以便为达赖喇嘛和中国总理之间的休战谈判铺平道路，从而恢复西藏以前的地位，并且确保中国的宗教自由”。决议居然
  “要求班达拉奈克总理召集所有的亚洲国家总理举行会议”来“解决”完全属于中国内政的西藏问题。决议还叫嚷“要求联合国组织对共产党在西藏所犯的罪行进行调查，并且恢复这个佛教国家以前的地位”。
