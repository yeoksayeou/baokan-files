Hongtong, June 22nd (report from this newspaper) – The Xiajiluo Management District of the Xiong'hu People's Commune in Hongtong County, Shanxi Province, has achieved a large-scale increase in wheat production by using small-plot experimentation to gain experience and then promoting it in large fields.

The Xiajiluo Management District of the Xiong'hu People's Commune is located on the east bank of the Fen River in the southern Shanxi Plain, with flat and fertile land, a warm climate, and abundant water resources, suitable for growing wheat and cotton. This year, the management district has more than 660 mu of winter wheat, all of which are growing very well and have not lodged. Harvesting is currently underway; according to the harvesting of some wheat fields, the yield per mu has already exceeded last year's average yield by more than 100 jin.

Last year, after the Party Central Committee proposed the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," the farmers here had great debates on issues such as deep plowing, close planting, fertilization, and irrigation. Some old farmers believed that on the issue of deep plowing, "Plowing too deep will disrupt the soil layers, and it will be a waste of effort." On the issue of close planting, some said, "Wheat fears too many seeds, land fears too much grass." Young people, however, believed that the deeper the plowing, the better, the more fertilizer, the better, and the larger the seeding rate, the better. Whose opinion should be followed to implement the "Eight-Point Charter" according to local conditions and ensure increased wheat production? At the time, no one could come to a definite conclusion. The management district party organization proposed adopting the method of small-plot experimentation, gaining experience, and promoting it in large fields, using production practice to explore laws and seek truth. In this way, the management district transferred fifteen old farmers and young people with senior primary school education, and with the help of teachers and students from Beijing Agricultural University, established an agricultural science research institute specializing in experimental research. The management district also designated more than 30 mu of land as experimental fields for the "small farm." In the experimental fields, they conducted comparative experiments on fertilization, deep plowing, close planting, irrigation, and pest and disease control, and recorded the experimental situation and results one by one in the "crop archives."

During the year-long experimental process, the management district cadres closely integrated the experience gained from small-plot experimentation with large-field promotion. Last autumn, when sowing wheat, many people suspected that using a five-legged seed drill would not spread the seeds evenly and would cause missing seedlings. Lao Qing-shun, an old farmer managing the "small farm," used a five-legged seed drill to sow a piece of land. After the wheat seedlings emerged, he organized old farmers from the entire management district who had the technique of using the drill to visit the field and operate it practically, enabling them to quickly master the technique of using the five-legged drill for sowing, ensuring that the wheat fields in the entire management district were sown and that each field achieved rational close planting. When the wheat turned green this year, some young people advocated early irrigation of the greening water, arguing that the wheat was growing well, with a large amount of fertilizer and close planting, and that more irrigation and earlier irrigation could promote early tillering, more tillering, and larger ears. Older people, however, advocated delayed irrigation, arguing that if the water was irrigated early, the wheat would grow wildly and lodge. When everyone was arguing, on March 21st, greening water was irrigated in two mu of experimental fields. Five or six days later, more than 70% of the wheat seedlings lodged. Accepting this lesson, the large-area wheat fields in the entire management district postponed the irrigation of greening water for twenty days, preventing early lodging of the wheat.

### 小田试验　大田推广  洪洞县下纪落管理区小麦大面积增产

    小田试验　大田推广
    洪洞县下纪落管理区小麦大面积增产
    本报洪洞22日电　山西省洪洞县雄火人民公社下纪落管理区，运用小田试验，取得经验，然后在大田中推广的办法，获得小麦大面积增产。
    雄火人民公社下纪落管理区位于晋南平原汾河东畔，土地平坦肥沃，气候暖和，水利资源丰富，适宜种植小麦和棉花。这个管理区今年的冬小麦共有六百六十多亩，都生长很好，没有发生倒伏，目前正在收割；根据部分麦田收打情况，亩产量已超过去年平均产量一百斤以上。
    去年，党中央提出全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”以后，这里的农民对于深耕，密植，施肥，浇水等问题，发生了很大的争论。有些老农在深耕问题上认为：“耕得深了会把土层翻乱，出力不讨好。”在密植问题上，有人说：“麦怕籽多，地怕草多。”青年人却认为翻地越深越好，肥料越多越好，播种量越大越好。根据谁的意见才能做到因地制宜贯彻“八字宪法”，保证小麦增产呢？当时谁也下不了肯定的结论。管理区党组织提出采取小田试验，取得经验，大田推广的办法，通过生产实践去摸规律、求真理。这样管理区就调了十五名老农和具有高小文化程度的青年人，在北京农业大学师生的帮助下，成立了一个农业科学研究所，专门作试验研究工作。管理区还划出三十多亩土地作为“小农场”的试验田。在试验田里，他们作了施肥，深耕，密植，浇水和防治病虫害等的对比试验，并把试验的情况和结果逐一记入“作物档案”中。
    在一年的试验过程中，管理区的干部把小田试验取得经验和大田推广紧密地结合起来。去年秋季播种小麦时，许多人怀疑采用五条腿耧播种，种籽撒不匀，会造成缺苗断垅。管理“小农场”的老农老清顺就用五条腿耧播种了一块地，等麦苗出土后组织全管理区有摇耧技术的老农到田间参观，实际操作，使他们很快地掌握了使用五条腿耧摇种的技术，保证了全管理区的麦田播种，块块做到了合理密植。今年小麦返青时，一些青年人主张早浇返青水，理由是小麦长的好，肥料大，又是密植，多浇水，早浇水，可以促使小麦早分蘖，分蘖多，穗子大。老年人却主张迟浇水，理由是水浇早了，小麦要狂长、倒伏。在大家争论不下时，3月21日便在二亩试验田里浇了返青水，五、六天后，果然70％以上的麦苗倒伏了。接受了这个教训，全管理区大面积麦田推迟了二十天才浇返青水，防止了小麦的早期倒伏。
