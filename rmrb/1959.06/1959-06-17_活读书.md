    "Living Reading"

    Harbin Institute of Technology collaborates with factories, making full use of the equipment and technical conditions of industrial departments to carry out scientific research. As a result, the quality of teaching and the level of scientific research have been significantly improved. This example once again proves that once teaching is combined with production practice, a vigorous new situation will emerge.
    The cooperation between schools and factories can increase production power for factories, but its significance goes far beyond this. As far as school education is concerned, the main purpose of school-factory cooperation is to cultivate high-quality talents. Because this kind of factory-school cooperation is a combination of book knowledge and production knowledge, thus achieving an important way to improve teaching quality and scientific research level. Everyone understands that book knowledge can only be obtained through diligent study, but people's views on how to use book knowledge are often not completely consistent, so there are two different methods of reading: "reading dead books" and "living reading."
    "Living reading" is to solve problems in production and develop new knowledge, and improve teaching quality by mastering and applying the basic principles in book knowledge. The factory-school cooperation carried out by Harbin Institute of Technology has improved the quality of teaching and the level of scientific research, which is the result of organizing students to carry out this kind of "living reading." Of course, different institutions of higher learning have different teaching paths that link theory with practice. However, for engineering universities, it is particularly important to implement factory-school cooperation and organize students to truly combine the learning of book knowledge with production knowledge. The problem now is that there is a certain contradiction between reading and productive labor. That is, we must both study hard and engage in productive labor. Too much productive labor may affect studying well. However, if arranged properly, productive labor can deepen students' understanding of book knowledge and improve the quality of teaching. Harbin Institute of Technology provides experience in this regard, and we hope that these experiences can blossom and bear fruit in higher education institutions with similar conditions.

    “活读书”
    祖年
    哈尔滨工业大学同工厂协作，充分利用工业部门的设备和技术条件，开展科学研究。结果，教学质量和科学研究水平显著提高。这个事例，再一次证明教学一旦和生产实际相结合，就会出现一个朝气蓬勃的新局面。
    学校和工厂协作，能为工厂增加生产力量，但它的意义远不止此。就学校教育来说，学校和工厂协作，主要是能够培养出质量较高的人材。因为这种厂校协作，是书本知识和生产知识相结合，从而达到提高教学质量和科学研究水平的重要形式之一。人人都会了解，书本知识要靠刻苦研读才能获得，但对于如何运用书本知识，人们的看法往往并不完全一致，因而读书的方法也有“读死书”和“活读书”之分。
    “活读书”是通过掌握运用书本知识中的基本原理，解决生产中的问题，并发展新的知识，提高教学质量。哈尔滨工业大学开展的厂校协作，提高了教学质量和科学研究水平，就是组织学生进行这种“活读书”的结果。当然，各种不同的高等院校，有各种不同的理论联系实际的教学途径。但是，就工科性的大学来说，实行厂校协作，组织学生真刀真枪地把学习书本知识和生产知识结合起来，就显得特别重要。现在的问题是，读书和生产劳动有着一定的矛盾。这就是既要认真读书又要生产劳动，生产劳动过多，可能影响到好好读书。但是，如果安排得好，就可以使生产劳动加深学生对书本知识的理解，并提高教学质量。哈尔滨工业大学提供了这方面的经验，愿这些经验能够在相同条件的高等学校中开花结果。（附图片）
