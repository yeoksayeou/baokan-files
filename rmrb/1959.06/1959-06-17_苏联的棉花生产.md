    Soviet Cotton Production

    The Seven-Year Plan and Cotton
    During the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), Soviet cotton growers faced an important task: to increase raw cotton production by 30% to 40% by 1965 compared to 1958, bringing the total raw cotton output to 5.7 million to 6.1 million tons. The raw cotton production of the Soviet Union's main cotton-growing republic, the Uzbek Republic, will increase by 20% to 30% (currently, this republic's cotton production accounts for two-thirds of the Soviet Union's total output), the Turkmen Republic by 40%, and the Tajik Republic by 30%. In these republics, the focus will be on planting superior varieties of long-staple cotton.

    Currently, the raw cotton production of the Uzbek Republic is equivalent to the total output of Brazil, Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran. In 1959, the planted area in this republic was approximately 1.5 million hectares, which is twice the cotton-growing area of Egypt. The cotton farmers of this republic have decided to deliver 3.6 million to 3.8 million tons of raw cotton to the state by 1965. The cotton produced by this republic each year can be woven into enough fabric for over a billion people to wear.

    During the Seven-Year Plan, the raw cotton production of the Tajik Republic, mainly long-staple varieties, will increase by 110,000 to 150,000 tons, reaching 560,000 to 600,000 tons by 1965. The fabric woven from this cotton could circle the Earth ninety times along the equator.

    By 1965, enterprises in the Russian Federal Republic will produce 15,400 meters of cotton fabric every minute, enough to sew 3,500 dresses.

    By 1965, the cotton fabric woven in the Kazakh Republic in one day will be 1.5 times more than the total cotton fabric produced in the entire year of 1940!

    New Drought-Resistant Cotton Varieties
    Breeders in the Fergana Valley of the Uzbek Republic have cultivated a new cotton variety that is drought-resistant, has very strong stems, and will not lodge even when hit by the most violent winds, and is suitable for growing on alkaline land. During the irrigation period, each cotton plant has about half as many bolls more than ordinary cotton, and it matures earlier than existing cotton varieties.

    This cotton, called "144-Ф", yields one-fifth more cotton than the "108-Ф" variety, which is widely grown in the Soviet Union and some other countries. The Soviet Union plans to cultivate tens of thousands of hectares of new wasteland in water-scarce areas to grow this cotton.

    Cotton Can Be Made into Nylon
    Can cotton fibers be improved, for example, to give them the properties of wool? Not long ago, experts would have answered such questions with an unequivocal no. Scientists held the opinion that cotton is least susceptible to external chemical effects because cotton fibers have a crystalline structure, and the molecules are very tightly bonded.

    However, recent new discoveries by a group of scientists in the Uzbek Republic have fundamentally changed past views on the internal structure of cotton. They have determined that the structure of cotton is not crystalline, but amorphous. Since cotton has an amorphous structure, it means that the inherent connections between its molecules can be completely broken, giving it new and beneficial properties, and subsequent experiments have fully proven the correctness of this theoretical inference. It has now been discovered that treating cotton fibers with nitrogen-containing compounds can give them many of the properties of wool, such as strength, resistance to rot, and ease of dyeing. Experiments with radioactive irradiation of cotton have also yielded good results. Under the influence of Υ-rays, cotton can acquire the properties of synthetic materials such as capron and nylon. The discoveries of Uzbek scientists have opened up broader avenues for the manufacture of strong and beautiful cotton fabrics.

    苏联的棉花生产
    七年计划和棉花
    在苏联七年计划（1959—1965年）期间，苏联植棉工作者面前摆着一项重要的任务：要在1965年使原棉产量比1958年增加30％到40％，使原棉总产量达到五百七十万吨到六百一十万吨。苏联主要植棉共和国——乌兹别克共和国的原棉产量将增长20％到30％（现在这个共和国的棉产量占苏联全国总产量的三分之二），土库曼共和国——40％，塔吉克共和国——30％。在这些共和国里，将以种植优良品种细纤维棉花为主。
    目前，乌兹别克共和国原棉的产量相当于巴西、巴基斯坦、土耳其和伊朗四国产量的总和。1959年，这个共和国种植的面积为一百五十万公顷左右，这个数字比埃及种棉面积要大一倍。这个共和国的棉农已经决定，到1965年将交给国家三百六十万吨到三百八十万吨原棉。这个共和国每年生产的棉花，可以织成足够十亿多人穿用的布匹。
    七年计划期间，塔吉克共和国以细纤维品种为主的原棉的产量将增加十一万吨到十五万吨，到1965年将达五十六万吨到六十万吨。用这些棉花织成的布匹，可以沿赤道环绕地球九十圈。
    到1965年，俄罗斯联邦共和国各企业每一分钟将生产一万五千四百公尺棉织品，用这些棉织品可以缝制三千五百件裙衣。
    到1965年，哈萨克共和国一天内织成的棉织品，将比1940年全年生产的棉织品多一点五倍！
    耐旱的新种棉花
    乌兹别克共和国费尔干纳盆地的选种家培育了一种新的棉花品种，耐旱，茎十分结实，即使受最猛烈的大风袭击也不会倒伏，适于在碱地上生长。在灌溉期，每株棉花上的棉铃比一般棉花大概多一半，它比现有的棉花都成熟得早。
    这种棉花名叫“144—Ф”，比苏联和某些国家广泛栽种的“108—Ф”要多出五分之一的棉花。苏联计划在缺水地区开垦几万公顷新荒地来栽种这种棉花。
    棉花可以做尼龙
    棉花纤维能否加以改善，比如使它具有羊毛的性能？在不久以前，专家们对类似这样的问题是采取毫不犹豫的否定态度的。科学家中流行着一种意见：棉花最不容易受外界化学作用的影响，因为棉花纤维有着结晶结构，各个分子之间结合得很牢固。
    但是一批乌兹别克共和国的科学家最近的新发现，从根本上改变了过去对于棉花内部构造的看法。他们确定，棉花的结构并不是结晶的，而是非晶形的。棉花既然是非晶形结构，就说明它的分子之间固有的联系完全可以破坏，而使它获得新的有益的性能，后来几次的试验完全证明这种理论推断的正确性。现在研究出，把棉花纤维用含氮化合物加以处理，就能获得羊毛所具有的很多性能，如坚固、不怕腐烂、容易着色等性质。对于棉花进行的放射性照射的试验也获得了良好的效果。在Υ射线的影响下，棉花可以得到像卡普隆和尼龙等合成材料的性能。乌兹别克科学家的发现为制造结实美观的棉布开辟了更加广阔的途径。
