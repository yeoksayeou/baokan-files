New Machines, New People
　　By our correspondents Xu Shijie and Hua Min

On the threshing ground surrounded by golden wheat stacks, the roar of machines harmonizes with people's laughter, spreading far and wide like bursts of spring thunder. The tall, automatic compound threshing machine, with its mouth wide open, swallows batches of wheat sheaves. Soon, plump grains of wheat pour out from the other end like a stream into grain bags. The eye-catching words on the machine tell people: it comes from the Kaifeng Machinery Factory; its power machine—a sixty-horsepower engine—is a product of the First Automobile Works in Changchun.

Beside the machine, several people stained with oil are working intently, some listening to whether its operation sounds normal, some carefully adjusting the speed. They seem to be skilled machinists; in fact, just a few days ago, they were ordinary farmers who had never seen this kind of machine.

This is the moving scene of a double harvest in one season in the Kongzhongguo People's Commune, Yancheng County, Henan Province: they have had a bumper wheat harvest, the working-class brothers have sent them brand-new machines, and a group of new people who have mastered these new machines have been born. Facing such a second harvest, how can they not laugh?

Hard Study

The threshing machine operators, who were ordinary farmers a few days ago, are now able to control these machines after a period of hard study.

One night, in the dormitory of the Luohe Threshing Machine Training Class, Wang Weifa, a student from the Kongzhongguo Commune, suddenly got up, grabbed the head of Xiao Yuan, who was sleeping soundly in the next bed, and shook it from side to side. "What are you doing?" Xiao Yuan asked in surprise, woken up. Only then did Wang Weifa, who was dazed, wake up from his dream of driving a machine. He mumbled, "I was driving the machine!" This happened on the second night that Wang Weifa came to the training class to study. In those days, Wang Weifa was very anxious. He thought: Xiao Yuan, Niu Zeng, and others who came with him had all operated gas generators and pot-bellied boilers during the mass steel production last year, but he had never touched a machine. This time, he was also one day late for the study. How could he learn to operate it in two days?

Speaking of Wang Weifa, people say he is a machine "fanatic." As soon as he entered the training class, he was fascinated by the machines. From early morning to late at night, he was rarely seen resting, either studying theory in books or climbing up and down fiddling with the machines. His instruction manual for the threshing machine was never out of his hands and was covered with dirt within a few days. After graduation, the teachers and students left, and the machines were also to be transported away. Taking advantage of the gap when the machines were being transported, he and two other students carefully reviewed for a day in front of the machines, making up for the course he had missed due to being one day late.

A few years ago, Weifa was still in elementary school. When a double-shared plow came to the village, he liked to watch the fun. Last year, combine harvesters from Heilongjiang Province supported their commune in the summer harvest, harvesting tens of thousands of catties of grain a day. His interest in agricultural machinery grew even greater. He thought: How good it would be to be able to drive a machine! Now, when he really started learning to drive a machine, this passion for agricultural mechanization became the driving force for his diligent study.

Must Subdue It

In early June, when wheat was being brought to the threshing ground, the commune members of Kongzhongguo Commune were vying to spread a piece of good news: "Our threshing machines are here! Our threshing machine operators are back!" It was at this time that the threshing machines that had already been installed on the threshing ground began trial runs. From day to night, the rumbling of the machines echoed in the sky.

Difficulties arose. The first threshing machine was put into production smoothly, but after the second threshing machine was installed, the conveyor chain, the drive shaft, and the grass-picking wheel shaft could not be turned no matter what. The wheat sheaves could not get in, and even with increased horsepower, they still would not turn; the screws beside the shaft were already bent, but they still would not turn. Where was the problem? No one could figure it out. The commune party committee invited Master Yan from the county water conservancy bureau, but Master Yan was not very familiar with the threshing machine's problems. These new apprentices and master workers pondered and drilled together, held meetings to study, and only then did they discover that the shaft was rusted. In this way, the solution was found: adding lubricating oil to the drive shaft and driving the shaft with a power machine. Finally, the shaft turned. However, as soon as the shaft turned, the chain on the shaft was broken due to excessive pulling force. They quickly ran to the commune's iron factory to repair the chain, and the threshing machine finally started to turn normally.

The Second Harvest

Now, after several days of trial runs, production has gradually become normal. The threshing volume of the two threshing machines is constantly increasing, reaching 40,000 catties per day.

Wang Weifa, who had never touched a machine in the past, can now judge whether production is normal and where the problem lies based on the sound of the machine. Niu Zeng, who was illiterate before liberation, has not only mastered the operating skills of the threshing machine, but also knows how to operate a power machine. Guan Xiuyi, who was originally a new agricultural tool promoter, has also become a power machinery operator.

    新的机器新的人
    本报记者　徐士杰　华敏
    在金黄色麦垛环绕着的麦场上，机器的轰鸣和着人们的欢笑，像阵阵春雷一样传向远方。高大的自动复式脱谷机，张着大嘴，把麦铺整批整批的吞下。很快，丰实的麦粒就从另一端流水般地倾泻到粮袋里。机器上醒目的字样告诉人们：它来自开封机械厂；它的动力机——六十马力的引擎，是长春第一汽车制造厂的产品。
    机器身旁，几个身染油渍的人正在紧张操作，有人在倾听它的运转响声是否正常，有人在细心地调整转速。看来，他们像是技术熟练的机手；其实，几天以前，他们还都是没有见到过这种机器的普通农民。
    这就是河南郾城县空冢郭人民公社一季双丰收的动人场面：他们的小麦丰收了，工人老大哥给他们送来了崭新的机器，一批掌握这批新机器的新人诞生了。面对着这样的第二个丰收，他们怎么能不欢笑呢？
    艰苦的学习
    几天以前还是普通农民的脱谷机手们，现在能够驾御这些机器，是经过一段艰苦的学习。
    一个深夜，在漯河脱谷机训练班的宿舍里，从空冢郭公社来的学员王位法，突然爬起来，抱着邻床正在酣睡的小袁的头，左右摇动。“干什么？”被弄醒的小袁惊奇地问道。这一喊，昏昏迷迷的王位法才从开机器的梦境里醒来，他含含糊糊地说：“我开机器了！”这件事发生在王位法到训练班学习的第二个夜晚。那几天，王位法心里一直非常着急，他想：和他同来的小袁、牛曾等去年大办钢铁时都开过煤气机、锅驼机，而自己从没摸过机器，这次学习，又晚来了一天，怎么能在两天内学会操作呢？
    提起王位法，人家都说他是个机器“迷”。一进训练班，他就被机器迷住了。从清早到深夜，很少见他休息，不是对着书本钻研理论，就是爬上躜下拨弄机器。他的一本脱谷机说明书更是分秒不离手头，几天内已经被翻得满是污迹了。结业了，老师同学走了，机器也要运走了。他趁机器运走的空隙，和另外两个同学，在机器前认真复习了一天，补上了由于迟到一天少学的课程。
    几年以前，位法还在小学读书，村里来了双铧犁，他就爱跟着看热闹。去年，黑龙江省来的联合收割机支援他们这个社夏收，一天能收打几万斤粮食，他对农业机器的兴趣就更大了。心想：能开机器有多好啊！现在，当他真的开始学习开机器的时候，这种向往农业机械化的激情，就成为他勤恳学习的动力了。
    一定要驯服它
    6月初，正是小麦上场的时候，空冢郭公社的社员们竞相传告着一个喜讯：“咱们的脱谷机来了！咱们的脱谷机手也回来了！”就是在这个时候，麦场上已经安装好的脱谷机开始了试车，从白天到深夜，隆隆的机声在天空回荡。
    困难发生了。第一部脱谷机顺利地投入了生产，可是第二部脱谷机安装好以后，输送链、主动轴和挑草轮轴，怎么也转不动。麦铺进不去，加大马力，仍转不动；轴边的螺丝轴已经拉弯了，还是转不动。毛病在哪里呢？谁也找不出。公社党委请来了县水利局的阎师傅，可是，脱谷机的毛病，阎师傅也不大通。这些新徒弟和老师傅们一起苦思苦钻，开会研究，才发现是轴生了锈。这样，办法也就找出来了：在主动轴上加上滑润油，用动力机带动轴，终于轴转动了。但是，轴刚转动，轴上的链条又因为拉力太大被拉断了。他们又赶快跑到公社的铁工厂修好链条，脱谷机终于正常的转动起来。
    第二个丰收
    现在，经过了几天的试车，生产已经逐渐走向正常，两部脱谷机的脱粒数量不断增加，每天达到了四万斤。
    过去从没有摸过机器的王位法，现在已能根据机器响声，判别生产是否正常，毛病出在什么地方。牛曾，这个解放前的文盲，现在不仅掌握了脱谷机的操作技术，而且也会开动力机了。原来是新式农具推广员的关修义，也已经变成动力机械员了。
