Increase Grain and Cotton Planting North and South of the Tianshan Mountains
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' Sown Area Increases by 54% Compared to Last Year

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has built 33 new farms and reclaimed more than 3 million mu of wasteland. As of now, the corps has sown more than 4.8 million mu of crops such as grain, cotton, oilseeds, and sugar beets north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, an increase of 54% over the total sown area last year and 1.2 times the total sown area in 1957. Currently, the corps members are still rushing to plant rice, corn, and other crops. At present, early-sown crops are emerging neatly and growing vigorously, and various farms are strengthening field management.

Urumqi, June 17th (by our newspaper) The crops sown by the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps this year are numerous and of high quality. As of now, more than 4.8 million mu of crops such as grain, cotton, oilseeds, and sugar beets have been sown north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, an increase of 54% over the total sown area last year and 1.2 times the total sown area in 1957. Among them, the wheat area has increased by 80%, the cotton area has increased by 21.8%, oilseed crops have increased from 75,000 mu to more than 270,000 mu, and sugar beets have increased from 17,000 mu to 144,000 mu.

During the sowing period, all farms paid special attention to quality and conscientiously implemented the "Four Don'ts" measures: don't sow if the land is not well prepared, don't sow if the soil moisture is not good, don't sow if machinery and other preparations are not good, and don't sow if seed treatment is not good. This ensured that all crops emerged neatly and grew vigorously.

Furthermore, in expanding the sown area, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' farms transferred a large number of personnel and machinery to support new farms in rushing to plow and sow. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the Production and Construction Corps has built 33 new farms and reclaimed more than 3 million mu of wasteland. The new farms have poor equipment and a shortage of labor and machinery. Before spring sowing, under the personal leadership of the Party committees of each reclamation area, a large number of excellent personnel and agricultural machinery were transferred from the old farms to support the new farms.

The Party committee secretaries of each new and old farm took the lead in establishing spring sowing headquarters. Leading cadres went deep into the fields, participating in production and leading production, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses, making the sowing task completed quickly and well. In northern Tianshan, due to late thawing this year, the spring sowing period was generally delayed by ten days to a month. Especially in the Ili region, continuous spring rains made it imperative that the farms eat and sleep in the fields, plowing and sowing in shifts day and night in order to not miss the farming season. The 50th Farm in this reclamation area completed the sowing task of more than 23,000 mu of dry land half a month ahead of schedule.

Furthermore, in order to ensure the timely completion of the expanded planting area, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps gave full play to the potential of machinery and continuously improved the efficiency of tractors.

This year, the corps' sown area has expanded by 54% compared to the total sown area last year, and rice, corn, and other crops are still being rushed to be planted, while the number of machines has basically not increased. During the spring sowing period, all new and old farms strengthened the organizational leadership of the mechanized farming teams. Not only did they carry out large-scale mechanical cooperation within the farms, but also, based on the different characteristics of early and late sowing due to climatic influences in various regions, they organized cooperation between farms, maximizing the efficiency of machines during the tense spring sowing. Under the strong leadership of the Party committees of the farms, the machinery personnel were full of energy, and everyone tried every means to use all available time in the morning and evening for maintenance and refueling. Many maintenance personnel carried toolboxes and went deep into the fields to ensure that tractors were repaired wherever they broke down, effectively shortening idle time and increasing effective working hours. The farms' maintenance workshops or repair plants made general parts themselves, achieving small repairs without leaving the farm.

This year, the average quota for each standard tractor unit was required to complete 12,000 standard mu, an increase of one time compared to the state quota. However, the machinery personnel of many farms repeatedly revised the quotas and increased them to 15,000 or even 20,000 standard mu. Such high quotas were quickly broken by many tractor teams. The Hou Zhengyuan tractor team of the Shihezi General Farm, the Zhang Wuchen tractor team of the Kuitun First Farm, and the May Fourth Youth tractor team of the Tianshan Farm, etc., reached 14,000 or even 19,000 standard mu by the end of April and the beginning of May, completing the 1959 sowing task ahead of schedule.

Furthermore, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' farms are going all out to grasp the field management of various crops.

At present, the thinning and seedling setting work of more than 1.1 million mu of cotton and early corn has been basically completed. In the cotton and corn fields of various reclamation areas in southern Xinjiang, the second cultivation and first topdressing are being carried out. The 50,500 mu of cotton planted on the newly reclaimed wasteland in the lower reaches of the Tarim River and in the Second Management Office of the Yanqi Reclamation Area have already grown several true leaves.

In the Manas and Usu reclamation areas of northern Xinjiang, the first cultivation is being carried out on more than 400,000 mu of cotton. The pest infestation in this area is more serious than in the past. Many farms have established pest control headquarters, vigorously mobilizing the masses and taking measures such as digging insect prevention ditches, clearing weeds, spraying pesticides, and manual capture to ensure the normal growth of crops. The 21st Regiment Farm in the Usu Reclamation Area, with the deputy political commissar and deputy director serving as the chief and deputy commanders of pest control, launched a mass movement of "one person capturing ten thousand insects and one thousand moths," and the entire regiment dug more than 15,900 meters of insect prevention ditches in three days.

The entire corps has universally watered the second time for 1.8 million mu of winter and spring wheat, and some have watered the third time. This year, the wheat of all farms has been universally applied with base fertilizer and topdressed with quick-acting fertilizer. Generally, the average number of seedlings per mu in wheat fields is around 300,000, and some reach more than 400,000, growing better than in previous years. At present, while stepping up field management, the corps members are actively preparing wheat harvesting machinery to welcome the upcoming summer harvest.

    天山南北增种粮棉
    新疆生产建设兵团播种面积比去年增加54％
    新疆军区生产建设兵团从去年大跃进以来，新建了三十三个农场，开荒三百多万亩。这个兵团截至目前为止，已在天山南北播种粮食、棉花、油料、甜菜等作物四百八十多万亩，比去年总播种面积扩大54％，比1957年总播种面积增加一点二倍。现在兵团健儿还在继续抢种水稻、玉米等。目前，早播作物出苗整齐，生长茁壮，各农场正加强田间管理。
    本报乌鲁木齐17日电　新疆军区生产建设兵团今年播种的作物又多又好。到目前为止，已在天山南北播种粮食、棉花、油料、甜菜等作物四百八十多万亩，比去年总播种面积扩大了54％，比1957年总播种面积增加了一点二倍。其中小麦面积增加80％，棉花面积增加21.8％，油料作物由七万五千亩增加到二十七万多亩，甜菜由一万七千亩增加到十四万四千亩。
    在播种期间，各农场都特别注意质量，认真贯彻执行地整不好不播、墒度不好不播、机具等准备工作不好不播、种子处理不好不播等
  “四不播”的措施，保证了各种作物出苗整齐，生长茁壮。
    又讯　在扩大播种面积中，新疆生产建设兵团各农场抽调大批人员和机械支援新场抢犁抢播。从去年大跃进以来，生产建设兵团新建了三十三个农场，开荒三百多万亩。各个新场设备较差，劳力、机力都很缺少。春播前，在各垦区党委亲自主持下，从各老场抽调了大批优秀人员和大批农业机械支援新场。
    各新、老农场都以党委书记为首成立了春播指挥部，领导干部深入田间，以参加生产领导生产，大大鼓舞了群众的生产热情，使播种任务完成得又快又好。天山北部今年由于解冻迟，春播期一般都推迟了十天到一个月左右，尤其是伊犁地区，春雨连绵，为了不误农时，各农场健儿吃在地里，睡在地里，干一块播一块，白天黑夜轮番抢犁抢播。这个垦区的五零农场还提前了半个月完成二万三千多亩旱田的播种任务。
    又讯　为保证适时完成扩种面积，新疆生产建设兵团充分发挥机械潜力，不断提高机车的工作效率。
    今年兵团播种面积已比去年总播种面积扩大了54％，现在还在继续抢种水稻、玉米等作物，而机械数量基本上没有增加。在春播期间，各新、老农场都加强了机耕队的组织领导工作。不仅在农场内大搞机械协作，同时还根据各地区气候影响，播种早晚不同的特点，组织场与场之间的协作，使机车在紧张的春播中发挥了极大的效率。在各农场党委大力领导下，机务人员干劲冲天，大家千方百计地利用早晚一切空闲时间，进行保养、加油。很多机修人员背上工具箱，深入田间，保证拖拉机在哪里出故障，就在哪里检修，有效地缩短了空转时间，增加了耕作的有效工时。各农场保养间或修理厂自己制作一般零件，作到小修不出场。
    今年在机车耕作定额上，平均每个标准台要求完成一万二千个标准亩，比国家定额增加一倍。但是，很多农场的机务人员仍然一再修改定额，提高到一万五甚至二万个标准亩；这样高的定额也被许多机车组很快地突破了。石河子总场侯正元机车组、奎屯一场张武臣机车组、天山农场五四青年机车组等，到4月底5月初便达到一万四甚至一万九千个标准亩，提前完成了1959年的播种任务。
    又讯　新疆生产建设兵团各农场正全力以赴地抓紧各种作物的田间管理工作。
    目前，一百一十多万亩棉花和早玉米的间苗定苗工作已经基本结束。在南疆各垦区的棉花、玉米正在进行第二次中耕和第一次追肥。塔里木河下游、焉耆垦区第二管理处新开垦荒地上种植的五万零五百亩棉花，已经长出好几张真叶。
    北疆玛纳斯、乌苏两垦区四十多万亩棉花正在全面进行第一次中耕。这个地区今年的虫害较以往严重。许多农场都成立了灭虫害指挥部，大力发动群众，采取了挖防虫沟、清除杂草、药杀和人工捕捉等措施，保证了作物的正常生长。乌苏垦区二十一团农场由副政委、副场长担任治虫正副总指挥，掀起了“一人捕杀万虫千蛾”的群众运动，全团在三天内挖防虫沟一万五千九百多公尺。
    全兵团一百八十万亩冬、春小麦已经普遍浇过第二遍水，部分已浇过三遍水。今年各农场的小麦都已普遍施了底肥和追施速效肥料。一般麦田平均每亩保苗在三十万株左右，部分达到四十万株以上，长得比往年好。目前，各农场健儿在加紧田间管理的同时，正在积极准备麦收机具，迎接就要到来的夏季大丰收。
