    The Relationship Between Deep Plowing and Land Preparation and Fertilization
    Wang Wenfu

    Some time ago, we conducted a survey on the issue of deep plowing of wheat in the Chengguan Management Area of the People's Commune in Kaiyuan County, Yunnan. The survey shows that after deep plowing, it is necessary to dry the clods and break up the soil to fully utilize the benefits of deeply plowed land. The following examples illustrate this point:

    Depth  Plant Height  Stem Diameter  Ear Length  Grains/Ear  Roots  Root Length  Yield  Remarks
    (ft)   (cm)          (cm)          (cm)        (grains)   (roots) (cm)         (kg)

    0.8    109.1        0.32          8.7        40         23     20.6        263     Clods dried for three days, soil
                                                                                             finely broken and dry.
    1.1    97          0.31          8.2        37         27     20.1        233     Not dried, soil clods
                                                                                             large and sticky.
    1.5    103          0.36          9.16        45         28     25.1        299     Clods dried for three days,
                                                                                             soil finely broken and dry.

    From the table above, it is evident that the wheat deeply plowed to 1.5 feet grew the best, with thick stems, large ears with many grains, well-developed roots, and a yield of 36 kg more per acre than wheat deeply plowed to 0.8 feet. The wheat deeply plowed to 1.1 feet, due to not being dried, had sticky soil, preventing normal root development, resulting in short plants, small ears with fewer grains, and a yield 30 kg less per acre than wheat deeply plowed to 0.8 feet. This indicates that after deep plowing, it is necessary to thoroughly dry the clods and break up the soil.

    According to field surveys in Chengguan, fertilizers must be increased after deep plowing, otherwise the yield-increasing effect of deep plowing will not be achieved. Detailed information is shown in the table below:

    (Chart omitted)

    The depth of deep plowing should be determined based on soil type and irrigation conditions. Generally, fields with chicken manure soil, clay soil, yellow sandy soil, black oily sandy soil, black calcium soil, and ash bubble soil have deep soil layers and can be deeply plowed. If the soil is white sandy soil or sandy fields, the soil layer is generally thin, and the bottom is stone sand or stone. Deep plowing should be treated differently depending on the situation. Wheat fields with low groundwater levels should adopt a method of layered deep plowing, meaning that the upper and lower layers of the soil should have a layer of original soil separating them. For example, if there is a one-foot-deep soil layer, only nine inches can be deeply plowed, leaving a one-inch separating layer. This will maintain the soil's ability to retain water and fertilizer. If there is no separating layer at the junction of the upper and lower soil layers, the soil will lose its ability to retain water and fertilizer, and the crops will be scorched to death when the soil temperature increases after the beginning of spring. Generally, sandy soil with high groundwater levels has shallow soil layers and is not suitable for deep plowing. (Originally published in Yunnan Daily) (Attached chart)

    深翻和整地施肥的关系
    王文富
    前些时候，我们在云南开远县人民公社城关管理区作了关于小麦深翻问题的调查。调查说明，深翻以后，还要晒好垡子、碎好土，才能充分发挥深翻地的作用。有下面几个例子可以说明这一点：
    深度  株高  茎粗  穗长  穗粒数  根数  根长  产量  备注
    （尺）（公分）（公分）（粒）（根）（公分）（公分）（斤）
    0.8    109.1  0.32    8.7  40  23  20.6  526  晒垡三天，土
                                                  块细碎、干燥。
    1.1    97     0.31    8.2  37  27  20.1  466  未晒垡，土块
                                                  大。粘重。
    1.5    103    0.36    9.16  45  28  25.1  598  晒垡三天，
                                                  土块细碎、干燥。
    从上表看来，深耕一尺五寸的麦子长得最好，茎粗壮，穗大粒多，根系发达，产量比深耕八寸的每亩多七十二斤。深耕一尺一寸的，由于未经晒垡，土壤粘重，根系不能正常发展，植株矮小，穗小粒少，产量比深耕八寸的还少六十斤。这说明深耕以后，还要晒透垡子和碎好土。
    据在城关的实地调查，深耕后必须增施肥料，否则达不到深耕增产的效果。详细情况见下表：
    （图表略）
    深耕的程度应当根据土壤的类型和水利等条件来决定。一般土质是鸡粪土、胶泥土、黄沙土、黑油沙土、黑钙土、灰泡土的田，土层深厚，可以深耕；如果土质是白沙土的田或者砂子田，一般土层较薄，田底子都是石砂底和石底，深耕的时候就要分别情况对待。地下水位低的麦田，要采取隔层深耕的办法，就是土壤上层和底层要有一层原土隔着。比如有一尺深的土层，只能深耕九寸，有一寸隔层，这样就能保持土壤的保水、保肥能力。如果上下土层衔接处没有隔层，土壤就会失去保水、保肥的能力，立春后地温一增高，作物就会被烤死。一般地下水位高的夹沙土土层都很浅，不宜深耕。　（原载云南日报）（附图表）
