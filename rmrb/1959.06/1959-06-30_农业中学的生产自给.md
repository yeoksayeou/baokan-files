Agricultural Middle Schools Achieving Self-Sufficiency in Production
Chen Guang, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

In early June, we revisited the Houmei and Ligang Agricultural Middle Schools in Jiangyin County. Our last visit was in late March, not long ago, but the changes are significant. They have made remarkable progress in both teaching and production. Take Houmei Agricultural Middle School (now known as Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School) as an example. Their production self-sufficiency is both lively and down-to-earth. Since May, they have implemented a semi-self-sufficient system. Except for grain, all expenses, including teachers' salaries, office expenses, and students' food costs, can be covered by production income. They calculated that from May 1st to May 23rd, the pure income from weaving straw sandals, straw bags, cattail bags, and making brick blanks alone was 1,231 yuan. Using this income to pay teachers' salaries and office expenses, totaling 541 yuan, leaves a surplus of 690 yuan. By the end of June, in addition to the aforementioned sideline occupations continuing to generate income, they also had 188 mu of wheat, expected to yield more than 28,000 jin, with a net income of over 1,900 yuan after deducting costs. Calculating according to the principle of "careful budgeting of income and sufficient budgeting of expenditures," their net income by the end of June was over 3,200 yuan, with expenditures of over 1,700 yuan. Adding the surplus of 690 yuan from the end of May, the total surplus would be over 2,100 yuan. It seems that their implementation of semi-self-sufficiency is not just a possibility, but has become a reality. The preliminary achievements they have made point out the possibility and specific path for production self-sufficiency for agricultural middle schools throughout the province.

	The experience of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School in creating conditions for production self-sufficiency is: "Leadership of the commune Party committee, support of the production brigade, coupled with self-reliance, starting with the easy and then the difficult, making do with whatever is available, adapting to local conditions, acting according to capabilities, and doing everything possible."

When Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School initially proposed the goal of achieving production self-sufficiency, a few teachers believed that "agricultural middle schools do not have the conditions to engage in production self-sufficiency." Conditions, of course, cannot be ignored, but conditions can be strived for and created. Conditions also require the drive of people to be fully utilized. Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School once discussed the issue of conditions for production self-sufficiency among the teachers and students of the school. The vast majority of people were very ambitious and determined that engaging in production is nothing more than needing labor, tools, and objects of labor, etc. Their school of more than 500 teachers and students are laborers with a certain level of political awareness and a certain level of education, which is an important condition. With this condition, other conditions can be created and difficulties overcome. For example, for production tools, small ones are brought by the students themselves. Now they have 250 hoes, 230 sickles, 120 rakes, as well as carrying poles, baskets, etc. Large ones are rented from the production brigade, or exchanged through labor. Students help the production brigade with labor, and the production brigade lends farm tools to the agricultural middle school. They now have two head of cattle, two plows, two man-powered water wheels, and one ox cart. With the development of school production, they have also purchased 83 rakes, 25 shovels, and tools such as chisels, axes, and saws with accumulated production funds. For example, for land, under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, they cultivated 204 mu of paddy and dry land and 70.08 mu of gardens, just like a production brigade. For example, for funds, they started with making straw sandals and cattail bags, which require the least amount of capital. Rice straw is allocated by the brigade, with 100 jin of rice straw exchanged for 12 pairs of straw sandals. Cattail reeds are supplied by the supply and marketing cooperative, and cattail bags are sold by the supply and marketing cooperative on commission. In this way, they gradually accumulated funds and have now established eight handicraft workshops for straw sandals, cattail bags, brick blanks, straw bags, sewing, farm tool carpentry, bamboo ware, and bearing instruments. They also consulted with the production brigade and adopted the method of "selling large pigs to pay for small pigs" to raise 124 pigs. They also used their accumulated production funds to raise 100 chickens and ducks each, 15 rabbits, and 5,000 fish. They call these fields, workshops, and breeding farms "labor production bases," which are some of the main conditions for their implementation of production self-sufficiency. They summarized their experience in creating these conditions as: "Leadership of the commune Party committee, support of the production brigade, coupled with self-reliance, starting with the easy and then the difficult, making do with whatever is available, adapting to local conditions, acting according to capabilities, and doing everything possible." Now, they are no longer worried about the lack of funds, tools, land, and other means of production. What they are considering is how to better exert their subjective initiative and fully utilize objective conditions.

	For agricultural middle schools to achieve production self-sufficiency, it is necessary to combine objective conditions and subjective initiative, both acknowledging objective conditions and giving play to subjective initiative to actively create conditions. This is what Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School has done.

How agricultural middle schools should specifically achieve production self-sufficiency, through what channels, and what conditions should be created are issues that many agricultural middle schools are pondering. Some say, "There are no conditions for self-sufficiency, it is simply impossible to do." This statement seems to imply that people can only succumb to conditions and cannot create them at all, which is obviously incorrect. Others say, "Hard work is all that is needed, there is no need to consider any conditions." This denies conditions and violates dialectical materialism, which is also obviously incorrect. Objective conditions and people's subjective initiative should be combined, both acknowledging objective conditions and giving play to subjective initiative to actively create conditions. The main conditions for production self-sufficiency at Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School are nothing more than land, farm tools, and technology, etc. In terms of sideline occupations, they are raw materials, sales channels, and production technology. To engage in production self-sufficiency, these objective conditions are certainly necessary. However, why can this agricultural middle school achieve production self-sufficiency while that one cannot, even when they have the same objective conditions? This is not entirely a matter of objective conditions, but a matter of whether subjective initiative has been exerted enough. It is evident that objective conditions are important, but objective conditions still need to be utilized by people. People's subjective initiative must not be ignored. The subjective initiative of people mentioned here refers on the one hand to the commune Party committee and the production brigade, which must have the enthusiasm to run agricultural middle schools well and actively solve the problems of teaching and production self-sufficiency in agricultural middle schools. On the other hand, it refers to agricultural middle schools, which must have the enthusiasm to both do a good job in teaching and in production self-sufficiency, seriously find the tricks, think of ways, and grasp tightly and do well in every aspect of production and teaching. Furthermore, conditions themselves can be divided into higher conditions and lower conditions, and can be varied, from small to large, from simple to complex, from incomplete to complete, with increasingly wider paths. Do not use existing conditions as the only standard and confine things within a box.

	In order to lay the foundation for production self-sufficiency, the production layout of agricultural middle schools should be adapted to the physical characteristics of young people, suitable for taking sideline occupations and high-yield cash crops as the main focus, and implementing agriculture and sideline occupations simultaneously.

Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School began to consider the issue of production planning in terms of utilizing objective conditions. They planned to plant 204 mu of rice in addition to planting 188 mu of wheat this year, striving to reach a yield of 700 to 900 jin per mu. They plan to plant 20 mu of vegetables to supply the entire school's students for their own consumption and sell some to exchange for cooking oil, salt, and other seasonings. They plan to plant 10 mu each of sweet potatoes and carrots to solve the problem of pig feed. Considering that students are of different ages, and that male and female physiques are of different strengths, they believe that not too many crops such as rice and wheat can be planted. Appropriate arrangements should also be made for sideline production. Therefore, they established the eight handicraft workshops mentioned above. From their situation, there is a production layout issue for production self-sufficiency in agricultural middle schools. This is a very important issue. Although Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School is not clear enough in this regard and some production layouts still need to be adjusted, they have already begun to touch on this issue. After our joint research with them, the preliminary opinion is that in order to lay a solid foundation for production self-sufficiency, the production layout of agricultural middle schools is more suitable for taking sideline occupations and high-yield cash crops as the main focus and implementing agriculture and sideline occupations simultaneously. In terms of agriculture, according to the characteristics of agricultural middle schools having the conditions to conduct scientific and technological research, it is suitable for intensive cultivation, high-yield, less planting, and more harvesting, striving to achieve garden-like production and thus raising the banner of high-yield prominently in the countryside and playing a demonstration role in the promotion of new technologies. Like Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School, it has played this role in the trial production of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium mixed fertilizer. Now the commune Party committee has established an agricultural science research office in their school, and students also have several professional courses such as agriculture, horticulture, and animal husbandry. The commune Party committee has also transferred a Party branch secretary of a production brigade to serve as vice-principal, focusing on leading production, and has also transferred two experienced farmers to serve as production instructors. With these conditions, we see that achieving this goal is very promising. Of course, the layout of the entire crop planting should also have long-term plans. It is necessary to see that agricultural middle schools universally enrolled some previous senior elementary school graduates last year, who are generally older and physically stronger, but if agricultural high schools are not established in another year, the junior high school department can only enroll younger senior elementary school graduates, which will bring difficulties to production self-sufficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to consider from the production layout, conduct research early, and adapt to local conditions, time, and people, and plan the planting area, varieties, and seeds of food crops, cash crops, fruit trees, etc. as early as possible, so that the production layout is suitable for the physical conditions of young people aged 13 to 16. At present, many agricultural middle schools are mainly planting rice and wheat, and in the future, more cash crops should be planted. In terms of sideline occupations, in addition to considering the conditions of production, supply, and sales, it is also necessary to consider developing production that requires less labor, less labor, and fewer tools, and higher output value, in order to open up production channels, lay the foundation, and gradually enrich equipment so that students can learn more skills through production. In short, agricultural middle schools are different from ordinary production teams. Therefore, their production layout should have its own characteristics. It should consider: what layout is more conducive to laying the foundation for self-sufficiency in funding; what layout is more suitable for the age characteristics of students; and what layout can adhere to half-day study and raise the banner of high-yield in production.

In order to make the production self-sufficiency of agricultural middle schools move forward steadily, each agricultural middle school should also formulate a self-sufficiency plan according to the production layout. It is necessary to calculate the total income and total expenditure, prepare a budget, and calculate whether the income can meet the expenditure. Expenditure cannot be underestimated, it must be sufficient; income cannot be overestimated, it must be estimated to encounter bad years and other difficulties, in order to leave room for maneuver and strive to exceed the planned target. It is best to develop a relatively specific production schedule, indicating how many people participate in labor throughout the year, and how much production income is generated each season and each month. Agriculture has two seasons a year, and sideline occupations have income every month and every season. Some supplement the season with the year, and some supplement the year with the season. Calculate them all to have a clear understanding.

	Agricultural middle schools must be good at arranging production self-sufficiency and teaching work. If arranged well, it can promote teaching and enable production and teaching to promote each other.

The production self-sufficiency of agricultural middle schools has made production tasks clearer, and the idea that "agricultural middle schools cannot cultivate fields well" has also been shattered by the facts. But will this approach affect teaching? This is another issue that many people are worried about. The practice of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School has powerfully proven that as long as the arrangements are made well, production self-sufficiency can promote teaching and production and teaching can promote each other. According to the investigation of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School, before semi-self-sufficiency, many students had unstable thoughts and were not focused on their studies because going to school increased the economic burden on their families. After the implementation of semi-self-sufficiency, the situation changed and they were much more focused on their studies. Many students said, "If we continue to do this, I will have the conditions to study in high school and university," so their enthusiasm for learning has greatly increased. In terms of time arrangement, they generally have classes in the morning, labor in the afternoon, and self-study in the morning and evening. They have a three-week holiday during the summer harvest and a four-week holiday during the autumn harvest. When the busy season is over or on rainy days, they study a little more. In short, the time for teaching and production can be arranged flexibly according to the situation. Under normal circumstances, they have 31 hours and 30 minutes of study time per week, accounting for 18.7% of the total number of hours in a week (calculated on the basis of seven 24-hour days, the same below); labor time is 28 hours, accounting for 16.7% of the total number of hours in a week; eating, rest, and sleep is 108 hours and 30 minutes, accounting for 64.6% of the total number of hours in a week. According to this arrangement, they can complete the learning plan and the production plan, adhere to half-day study, and will not squeeze out the learning tasks. It seems that it is very important for each agricultural middle school to calculate the labor force and labor time, calculate the teaching time, and calculate the eating, rest, and sleep time. For example, calculate how much labor force and labor time is required to complete a certain production task, and how much time is required for learning. Comparing the two, the principle is not to affect half-day study. Without calculating this, there is no idea in mind. If it is not done well, production is taken care of and teaching cannot be taken care of, or teaching is taken care of and production cannot be taken care of, which cannot reflect the nature of agricultural middle schools. Furthermore, in addition to the time for production and learning, how much time is left for eating, rest, and sleep? Young people should have sufficient rest and sleep time, and should have appropriate cultural and entertainment time, which is more conducive to doing a good job in production and learning. Agricultural middle schools are both production teams and learning teams. The practice of turning agricultural middle schools into purely production teams should be prevented.

	In the process of production self-sufficiency, agricultural middle schools should take appropriate measures to allow teachers to have more time for teaching and improve the quality of teaching.

There is also the issue of teachers' teaching time. Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School once had too much time for teachers to follow the class to work. They had to go to lead students to work every afternoon, and only had a little time in the morning and evening to grade homework, prepare lessons, and improve themselves. As a result, a lot of homework was backlogged and the quality of grading was not high. The school leaders discovered this problem, so they studied it together with everyone and took appropriate measures, mainly to train student cadres to let students serve as production team leaders, lead production, and clarified the production responsibilities of experienced farmers and technicians, strengthened technical guidance, and enabled teachers to free up more time for teaching work. After such arrangements, teachers only need to participate in labor for two afternoons a week, and the teaching time is 50 hours, accounting for 29.8% of the total number of hours in a week; production labor is 10 hours, accounting for 5.9% of the total number of hours in a week; eating, rest, and sleep is a total of 108 hours, accounting for 64.3% of the total number of hours in a week. After doing this, teachers can both understand and improve students from production, and enrich their teaching content from production; they can both work with students and have more time to do a good job in teaching and strive to improve the quality of teaching. At present, the excessive labor time and class activities of teachers in agricultural middle schools is a widespread problem. The practice of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School can be used for reference to allow teachers to free up time for teaching and improve the quality of teaching. In order to improve the quality of teaching, teachers should take language, mathematics, physics and chemistry, and agricultural knowledge as the main courses and do a good job in the main aspects of teaching.

	In order to closely integrate teaching and production, learning organizations and production organizations should be arranged flexibly, and adjusted in time with changes in teaching and production tasks.

In order to closely integrate teaching and production, Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School has also begun to pay attention to the appropriate arrangement of production organizations and learning organizations. The principal of the school is concurrently the first secretary of the commune Party committee, and there are two vice-principals, one focusing on grasping teaching and the other focusing on grasping production. The eight handicraft workshops of the school are all organized into a professional team, with members drawn from each class. Horticulture and vegetable and livestock breeding are organized into professional teams on a class basis (the school has ten classes such as agronomy, sericulture, animal husbandry, primary teacher training, and kindergarten teacher training). In addition, production teams are established on a class basis, with teachers serving as production instructors and the team leaders and deputy team leaders elected by the students. The team is also divided into production groups according to the age and physical strength of the students. This organizational method does not cause the homeroom teacher's entire energy to be immersed in production management work, and they can have time to do a good job in teaching. At the same time, it does not cause the learning organization and the production organization to be disconnected, which affects the unified arrangement of teaching and production. This organizational method is suitable for their current situation and is feasible. However, the arrangements for learning organizations and production organizations cannot be fixed and should be adjusted in time with changes in teaching and production tasks. School leaders should always pay attention to this and make the teaching and production, the class and the production group adapt to each other and change flexibly.

From the teaching content of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School, production and teaching promote each other. They once took a mathematics class on measuring earthwork and fields, and practically applied the book knowledge they learned in production. Students reflected, "Not only can we do it on paper, but we can also measure it in the field, which greatly consolidates the teaching results." Because of the rich experience gained in labor, students also reflected when writing compositions, "It's not that there is nothing to write, but that there are many things we want to write." In addition, in terms of agricultural knowledge, in terms of physics and chemistry, and in terms of several professional courses such as animal husbandry, the ability to understand and accept has also deepened due to production labor, and the enthusiasm and initiative for learning have also improved.

The situation of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School has made us see that as long as the time for teaching and labor is arranged reasonably, as long as attention is paid to the proper arrangement of teachers' lesson preparation, homework grading, and self-improvement time, and as long as attention is paid to the good integration of teaching and production in terms of organization, content, and methods, then the content of teaching will be enriched, the methods of teaching will be improved, and the results of learning will be expanded and consolidated, without squeezing out teaching or affecting the improvement of teaching quality. However, if these problems are not properly solved, it is also possible to turn the agricultural middle school into a purely production brigade, and it will not be an agricultural middle school. We hope that agricultural middle schools throughout the province will pay attention to this issue, move forward along a correct path, so that agricultural middle schools can not only raise the banner of high-yield, but also raise the banner of cultural revolution. Agricultural middle schools should aspire to raise these two distinct banners high and let them flutter in the wind. This is a goal.

	The production self-sufficiency and teaching of agricultural middle schools can only thrive and progress by relying on the leadership of the commune Party committee, the support of the masses, and close cooperation with ordinary middle schools.

From the situation of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School, to achieve production self-sufficiency, it is first necessary to rely on the leadership of the commune Party committee. It is the commune Party committee that has added leadership and technical strength to Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School; it is the commune Party committee that, in unified arrangements, has solved the problems of land, cattle, large farm tools, and raw materials and sales channels for Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School; it is the commune Party committee that has made unified deployments and arrangements for the work of agricultural middle schools in production, learning, and the implementation of the Party's policies. The production self-sufficiency and teaching of agricultural middle schools can only thrive if the commune Party committee strengthens its leadership. The production of agricultural middle schools must also rely on the support of the masses. Whether in terms of commodity exchange, in terms of the exchange of labor and tools at equal value, or in terms of production experience, it cannot be separated from the masses. Therefore, agricultural middle schools must never harm the interests of the masses, but should enthusiastically support the masses and learn from the masses, while gaining their support. The production management, economic accounting, etc. of agricultural middle schools must also learn from the production team, and establish and improve these systems correctly according to their own characteristics, thereby promoting the development of production, constantly improving labor productivity, and overfulfilling production plans.

In terms of teaching, agricultural middle schools must also closely cooperate with ordinary middle schools. Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School and Chengxi Middle School are neighbors. This semester, the two schools jointly organized a teaching and research group. Agricultural middle schools regard ordinary middle schools as older brothers and humbly learn from them; ordinary middle schools regard agricultural middle schools as close brothers and warmly care for and help them. In the cause of socialist secondary education, their goals are consistent. Only by helping each other can they benefit the development of the cause and advance together. This cooperative relationship is worth promoting.

It seems clear that under the leadership of the Party, with the support of the masses, and with the cooperation of ordinary middle schools, the production self-sufficiency and the improvement of teaching quality in agricultural middle schools are full of hope. It can now be seen that agricultural middle schools, after students pay fees to support the school, have begun to embark on the path of production supporting the school; in the process of production supporting the school, they have moved from partial self-sufficiency and semi-self-sufficiency to mostly self-sufficiency. The speed of this self-sufficiency process depends on the speed of production development in agricultural middle schools. In order to lay a solid foundation for the production self-sufficiency of agricultural middle schools, all agricultural middle schools must run schools diligently and thriftily; they must pay attention to the stability of the school site and production base and must not change them frequently; newly enrolled students can still be charged fees in the first year. In the second year, they can strive to achieve self-sufficiency after participating in labor in the school. Moving forward steadily in this way, the production self-sufficiency of agricultural middle schools will definitely become more and more solid and reliable, and more and more consolidated and improved. We should see that agricultural middle schools, together with ordinary middle schools, play a great role in popularizing education, in cultivating junior technical talents for agricultural mechanization and electrification, and in cooperating with the cultural revolution and technological revolution in rural areas, and shoulder important responsibilities. If the agricultural middle schools in our province enroll an average of 200,000 students each year, then they will enroll 2 million students in ten years and 4 million students in twenty years. This is such an important thing for the countryside. The comrades of our Party committees at all levels and the teachers and students of agricultural middle schools should see this prospect and the current role of agricultural middle schools, establish great ambitions, boost great efforts, strengthen leadership, work hard, consolidate agricultural middle schools, improve agricultural middle schools, and run this new form of school well, writing a new page in the history of education in Jiangsu.

    农业中学的生产自给
    中共江苏省委书记　陈光
    6月上旬，我们重访了江阴县的后梅和利港两所农业中学。上一次到这里来访问，是3月下旬，离现在时间并不长，但是变化却不小，他们在教学上和生产上，都有了显著的进步。拿后梅农业中学（现名西石桥农业中学）来说，他们的生产自给，搞得既热热闹闹又踏踏实实。从5月份开始，他们实行半自给，除粮食之外，教师的工资、办公费用和学生的菜金，全部可以由生产所得来开支。他们算了一笔账：5月1日至5月23日这一段时间里，单是编织草鞋、草包、蒲包和做砖坯的纯收入，就有一千二百三十一元；拿这笔收入用来支付教师工资和办公费用等共五百四十一元，还结余六百九十元。到6月底，他们除上面所讲的几项副业继续有收入之外，还有一百八十八亩三麦，预计可收二万八千多斤，扣除成本以后，纯收入将有一千九百多元。按照“收入精打、支出足算”的精神来计算一下，到6月底，他们的纯收入是三千二百多元，支出是一千七百多元，连5月底结余的六百九十元，就能结余二千一百多元。看来，他们实行半自给不只是一种可能，而已经成为现实。他们所取得的这种初步成绩，给全省农业中学指出了生产自给的可能性和具体道路。
      西石桥农业中学创造生产自给条件的经验是：“公社党
  委的领导，生产大队的支持，加上自力更生，先易后难，因
  陋就简，因地制宜，量力而行，尽力为之。”
    西石桥农业中学在开始提出生产自给的奋斗目标时，曾经有少数老师认为“农业中学没有条件搞生产自给”。条件，当然是不可忽视的，但是条件可以争取，可以创造，条件还要有人的干劲去充分利用。西石桥农业中学曾经在学校师生中讨论了生产自给的条件问题，绝大多数人都很有志气地认定：搞生产不外乎要有劳动力、劳动工具和劳动对象等等，而他们学校五百多名师生，是有一定政治觉悟、有一定文化水平的劳动者，这就是一个重要的条件。有了这个条件，就可以创造其他的条件，克服困难。比如生产工具，小型的由学生自带，现在已经有了锄头二百五十把，镰刀二百三十把，钉耙一百二十把，还有扁担、挑箕等等；大型的向生产大队租借，或者用换工的办法，由学生帮生产大队劳动，由生产大队将农具借给农业中学，他们现在已经有耕牛二条，犁二部，人车二部，牛车一部；随着学校生产的发展，他们还用积累的生产资金添购了钉耙八十三把，锹二十五把，并且购买了凿、斧、锯等生产工具。比如土地，在公社党委统一领导下，他们像一个生产大队一样，耕种了水旱田二百零四亩，园地七十亩零八分。比如资金，他们先从花本钱最少的打草鞋和打蒲包做起，稻草由大队拨给，一百斤稻草换十二双草鞋，工具由学生自带；蒲草由供销社供给，蒲包由供销社代销，这样，他们就逐步积累了资金，现在已经办起了草鞋、蒲包、砖坯、草包、缝衣、农具木工、竹器、轴承仪表等八个手工业工场。他们还和生产大队协商，采取“卖了大猪还小猪钱”的办法，饲养了一百二十四头猪，又用自己积累的生产资金，饲养了鸡鸭各一百只，兔十五只，鱼五千尾。他们把这些田地、工场和饲养场称为“劳动生产基地”，这就是他们实行生产自给的一些主要条件。他们总结自己创造这些条件的经验是：“公社党委的领导，生产大队的支持，加上自力更生，先易后难，因陋就简，因地制宜，量力而行，尽力为之。”现在，他们已经不愁没有资金、没有工具、土地和其他生产资料，他们在考虑的，是怎样更好地发挥主观能动性，充分利用客观条件的问题。
      农业中学实行生产自给，要把客观条件和主观能动性结
  合起来，既要承认客观条件，又要发挥主观能动性去积极创
  造条件。西石桥农业中学就是这样做的。
  农业中学要生产自给，具体怎样走法，通过什么途径，应当创造哪些条件，这是许多农业中学正在寻思的问题。有人说：“自给没有条件，根本办不到。”这种说法，好像人只能屈服于条件，完全不能创造条件，这显然是不正确的。又有人说：“苦干就是了，用不着考虑什么条件。”这是否定条件，违反了辩证唯物主义，也显然是不正确的。应当把客观条件和人的主观能动性结合起来，既要承认客观条件，又要发挥主观能动性去积极创造条件。西石桥农业中学生产自给的主要条件，无非是土地、农具和技术等等，在副业方面就是原料、销路和生产技术。要搞生产自给，当然要有这些客观条件。但是，为什么有些客观条件相同的农业中学，这所能生产自给，那所却不能生产自给呢？这就不完全是客观条件问题，而是主观能动性发挥得够不够的问题了。由此可见，客观条件固然重要，但是客观条件还要人来利用。人的主观能动性决不可忽视。这里所说的人的主观能动性，一方面是指公社党委和生产大队，要有办好农业中学的积极性，主动地解决农业中学教学上和生产自给上的问题；另一方面是指农业中学，要有既搞好教学又搞好生产自给的积极性，认真地找窍门、想办法，在生产和教学的各个环节上都抓得紧，抓得好。再拿条件本身来说，也有较高的条件和较低的条件之分，完全可以多种多样，由小到大，由简单到复杂，由不完备到完备，路子越走越宽，不要用现有的条件作为唯一的标准，用一个框子把事情框死。
      为了给生产自给打下基础，农业中学的生产布局，要适
  应青少年的身体特点，适宜于采取以副业和高产的经济作物
  为主，实行农业和副业同时并举。
    西石桥农业中学在利用客观条件方面，开始考虑到生产计划的问题。他们计划今年除种三麦一百八十八亩之外，还要种水稻二百零四亩，单产争取达到七百斤到九百斤。种蔬菜二十亩，供全校学生自吃，卖出一部分换回油盐等调料费。种山芋、胡萝卜各十亩，解决猪饲料问题。他们考虑到学生年龄大小不同，男女体质强弱不等，认为稻麦等作物不能种植过多，对于副业生产，也要作适当安排，因此他们建立了前面所提到的那八个手工业工场。从他们那里的情况看来，农业中学的生产自给有个生产布局的问题。这是一个很重要的问题。虽然西石桥农业中学在这方面还不够明确，有些生产布局还有调整的必要，但是，他们已经开始接触到这个问题。经过我们和他们共同研究，初步的意见是：为了给生产自给打下牢固的基础，农业中学的生产布局，比较适宜于以副业和高产的经济作物为主，实行农业和副业同时并举。在农业方面，根据农业中学有条件进行科学技术研究的特点，适宜于精耕细作，高产少种多收，努力做到生产园田化，从而在农村中高高举起高额丰产的旗帜，并在新技术的推广上起示范作用。像西石桥农业中学，在试制氮磷钾混合肥料上，就起过这种作用。现在公社党委已在他们学校成立了一个农业科学研究室，学生也有农业、园艺、饲养等几门专业课程。公社党委还调配一位生产大队的党支部书记去担任副校长，着重领导生产，又调配了两位老农去做生产指导。有了这些条件，我们看，要达到这个目标是大有希望的。当然，整个作物种植的布局，还要有长远的打算，要看到去年农业中学普遍招收了一部分往届高小毕业生，他们的年龄一般较大，体力较强，但是如果再过一年不办农业高中，初中部只能招收年龄较小的高小毕业生，那就会给生产自给带来困难。因此要从生产布局上考虑，早作研究，因地、因时、因人制宜，将食粮、经济作物、果木等等的种植面积、品种、种子等及早规划好，使生产布局适合于十三岁到十六岁青少年的身体条件。现在，有不少农业中学是以种稻麦为主的，今后还要多种一些经济作物。在副业方面，根据学生年龄等特点，除了考虑产供销的条件之外，还要考虑到发展那些劳动较轻、劳动力和工具需要较少、产值较高的生产，以求广开生产门路，打下基础，逐步充实设备，使学生能够通过生产学到更多的技能。总之，农业中学不同于一般的生产队，因此，它的生产布局应当有自己的特点。它应当考虑到：怎样的布局，更加有利于奠定经费自给的基础；怎样的布局，更加适合于学生年龄的特点；怎样的布局，可以坚持半日制的学习，并在生产上举起高额丰产的旗帜。
    为了使农业中学的生产自给稳步前进，各个农业中学还应当根据生产布局制订一个自给的计划。要算一算总收入和总支出的账，要作好预算，要算一算收入能不能适应支出。支出不能算少，要打足；收入不能算高，要估计到碰到年成不好和其他困难，以留有余地，争取超过预定指标。最好是制订一个比较具体的生产进度表，标明全年多少人参加劳动，每季每月生产收入多少。农业一年两季，副业是每月每季都有收入，有的以年补季，有的以季补年，都计算一下，做到心中有数。
      农业中学要善于安排生产自给和教学工作。安排得好，
  就能推动教学，使生产和教学互相促进。
    农业中学的生产自给，使生产任务更加明确了，有些人顾虑“农业中学种不熟田”的想法也被事实打破了。可是这样的做法，会不会影响教学呢？这又是不少人所担心的问题。西石桥农业中学的实践有力地证明了：只要善于安排，生产自给可以推动教学，生产和教学可以互相促进。据西石桥农业中学的调查，原来有不少学生在半自给以前，因为上学使家庭经济负担增加，思想很不稳定，学习也不够安心。在实行了半自给以后，情况就不同，学习都安心多了。很多同学说：“照这样做下去，我读高中、大学也有了条件”，因此学习的劲头大为提高。再从时间的安排上来说，他们一般是上午上课，下午劳动，早晚自修。夏忙期间放假三周，秋忙期间放假四周，大忙过去或阴雨天，就多学一点。总之，教学与生产的时间可以因时制宜，灵活安排。在一般情况下，他们每周学习时间有三十一小时三十分，占一周的总时数（按七个二十四小时计算，下同）的18.7％；劳动时间有二十八小时，占一周的总时数的16.7％；吃饭、休息和睡眠有一百零八小时三十分，占一周的总时数的64.6％。按照这样的安排，他们可以完成学习计划和生产计划，坚持半日制的学习，并不会把学习的任务挤掉。看来，各个农业中学都算一笔劳动力和劳动时间的账，算一笔教学时间的账，算一笔吃饭、休息和睡眠时间的账，是非常重要的。比如算一算，完成一定的生产任务要多少劳动力和劳动时间，学习又要多少时间，两下相比，要以不影响半日制的学习为原则。不算这笔账，心中无数，弄得不好，顾了生产就顾不了教学，顾了教学就顾不了生产，这就不能体现农业中学的性质。再比如，除了生产和学习的时间之外，还有多少吃饭、休息和睡眠时间，年青人应当有充分的休息和睡眠时间，应当有适当的文化娱乐时间，这样，就更有利于搞好生产和学习。农业中学既是生产队，又是学习队，把农业中学变成单纯生产队的做法，应当防止。
      农业中学在生产自给过程中，要采取适当措施，让教师
  有更多时间来进行教学工作，提高教学质量。
    这里还有一个教师的教学时间问题。西石桥农业中学曾经因为教师跟班劳动的时间过多，每天下午都要去领导学生劳动，只有早晚一点时间批改作业、备课和进修，因而积压了不少作业没有批改，批改的质量也不高。学校领导上发现了这个问题，就和大家共同研究，采取了适当措施，主要是培养学生干部，让学生担任生产小队长，领导生产，并且明确了老农和技术员的生产责任，加强技术指导，使教师腾出更多的时间来进行教学工作。经过这样的安排，教师每周只要两个下午去参加劳动就可以了，而教学时间就有五十小时，占一周的总时数的29.8％；生产劳动十小时，占一周的总时数的5.9％；吃饭、休息、睡眠共一百零八小时，占一周总时数的64.3％。这样做了以后，教师既能从生产中了解和提高学生，又能从生产中丰富自己的教学内容；既能和学生一起劳动，又能有更多的时间搞好教学，努力提高教学质量，现在农业中学教师的劳动时间过多，班级活动过多，是一个带普遍性的问题，可以参考西石桥农业中学的做法，让教师腾出时间来进行教学工作，提高教学质量。为了提高教学质量，教师要把语文、数学、物理化学、农业知识作为主要课程，搞好主要方面的教学。
      为了教学和生产紧密结合，要灵活安排学习组织和生产
  组织，要随着教学和生产任务的变化及时调整。
    西石桥农业中学为了教学和生产的紧密结合，还开始注意到生产组织和学习组织的适当安排。学校的校长，由公社党委第一书记兼任，另外有两个副校长，一个重点抓教学，一个重点抓生产。学校的八个手工业工场，都组成一个专业队，成员由各班抽调。园艺菜蔬和饲养是以班为单位，成立专业队（学校有农艺、蚕桑、畜牧、初师、幼师等十个班）。此外，以班为单位成立生产小队，老师任生产辅导员，正副小队长由学生推选。小队下还有生产小组，按学生年龄、体力情况，分别搭配编组。这样的组织方法，不致使班主任的全部精力都陷入生产管理工作中去，能够有时间抓好教学，同时又不致使学习组织和生产组织脱节，而影响到教学和生产的统一安排。这种组织方法，适合于他们目前的情况，是可行的。但是，学习组织和生产组织的安排，都不能固定化，应当随着教学和生产任务的变化，及时调整。学校领导上应当经常注意到这一点，使教学和生产、班级和生产小组互相适应，变化灵活。
    从西石桥农业中学的教学内容来看，生产和教学是相互促进的。他们曾经上过测量土方和田亩的数学课，而且把学到的书本知识在生产中实际应用，学生都反映：“不但会在纸上做，还会实地测量，大大巩固了教学成果。”因为在劳动中得到丰富的体验，做起作文来，学生也反映：“不是没有什么内容可写，而是有许多话想写出来。”此外，在农业知识方面，在物理、化学方面，在饲养等几门专业课方面，由于生产劳动，理解和接受的能力也都加深了，学习的积极性和自觉性也提高了。
    西石桥农业中学的情况，使我们看到：只要把教学和劳动的时间安排合理，只要注意到教师的备课、批改作业和进修时间的恰当安排，并且注意到把教学和生产从组织上、内容上、方法上很好地结合起来，那就会丰富教学的内容，改进教学的方法，扩大和巩固学习成果，而不会挤掉教学或影响教学质量的提高。但是，如果不妥善解决这些问题，也有可能使农业中学变成一个单纯的生产大队，不成其为一个农业中学。我们希望全省农业中学注意这个问题，循着一个正确的道路前进，使农业中学不仅可以举起高额丰产的旗帜，而且可以举起文化革命的旗帜。农业中学应当立志把这两面鲜明的旗帜，高高举起，迎风招展。这是一个目标。
      农业中学的生产自给和教学，只有依靠公社党委领导，
  群众支持，和普通中学亲密协作，才能蒸蒸日上，得到进步。
    从西石桥农业中学的情况来看，要生产自给，首先要依靠公社党委的领导。正是公社党委，给西石桥农业中学加派了领导力量和技术力量；正是公社党委，在统一安排中，给西石桥农业中学解决了土地、耕牛、大型农具和原材料、销路等问题；正是公社党委，在生产、学习和贯彻执行党的方针政策中，对农业中学的工作做了统一的部署和安排。农业中学的生产自给和教学，只有公社党委加强领导，才能蒸蒸日上。农业中学的生产还要依靠群众的支持，不论在商品交换方面，在劳动力和工具的等价交换方面，在生产经验方面，都不能离开群众，因此，农业中学决不能损害群众的利益，而应当热忱地支持群众，向群众学习，同时取得他们的支持。农业中学的生产管理、经济核算等等，也要向生产队学习，并且根据自己的特点，使这些制度正确地建立和健全起来，从而促进生产的发展，不断提高劳动生产率，超额完成生产计划。
    农业中学在教学上，还要和普通中学亲密协作。西石桥农业中学和澄西中学是邻居，这个学期，两校共同组织了教研组，农业中学把普通中学当作老大哥，虚心向他们学习；普通中学把农业中学当作亲兄弟，热情地关怀和帮助他们。在社会主义中等教育事业中，他们的目标是一致的，只有互相帮助，才有利于事业的发展，才能共同前进。这种协作关系，值得发扬。
    看来很明显，在党的领导下，有群众的支持，有普通中学的协作，农业中学的生产自给和教学质量的提高，都是充满希望的。现在可以看到：农业中学经过学生缴费养校，已经开始走上生产养校；在生产养校中，已经由部分自给、半自给走上了大部分自给。这个自给过程的快慢，决定于农业中学生产发展的快慢。为了打下农业中学生产自给的牢固基础，所有农业中学都要勤俭办学；都要注意校址和生产基地的稳定，不能经常变动；新招的学生，第一年也仍然可以收费，第二年，他们在学校参加了劳动，可以争取实行自给。这样稳步前进，农业中学的生产自给，一定会越来越坚实牢靠，越来越巩固、提高。我们应当看到，农业中学和普通中学一起，在普及教育方面，起着很大的作用，在培养农业机械化、电气化的初级技术人材方面，在配合农村的文化革命和技术革命方面，担负着重要的责任。我省农业中学，每年如果平均招二十万学生，那末十年将招二百万学生，二十年将招四百万学生，这对农村来说，是多么重要的事情。我们各级党委的同志们，农业中学的师生们，应当看到农业中学的这个前景和现在的作用，立大志、鼓大劲，加强领导，艰苦奋斗，巩固农业中学，提高农业中学，办好农业中学这样一种新形式的学校，在江苏的教育史上写下新的一页。
