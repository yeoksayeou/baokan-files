Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 10th: According to TASS, New York, June 9th: The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" recently published a declaration by the Executive Bureau of the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, calling for the expansion of the struggle for freedom and against imperialist repression on the Latin American continent.

The declaration stated: The struggle for bread, for land, and for the freedom of our continent is expanding daily. After the events in Cuba and Venezuela, this struggle has not stopped, but continues to expand. Now, it has spread to Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan people have joined the battle, and a powerful front for democracy has been formed within the country, extending from the Communist Party to conservative groups.

The declaration said that the mass struggle in Paraguay is also developing, shaking the foundations of the Stroessner tyranny.

In Ecuador, citizens of Guayaquil, led by university students, took to the streets to protest the government's brutal policies...

In Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic - Editor's note), a struggle has broken out against the most cruel and corrupt tyranny – the despotic tyrant Trujillo. The people's desire for freedom is growing.

The declaration concluded: "The People's Socialist Party and all the forces of freedom on the continent who are resolutely rising up to fight are united..." and called on all Cuban revolutionaries and the people of the country to support the people of Latin American countries who are currently engaged in struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Asuncion, June 10th: The Paraguayan Communist Party recently issued a declaration calling on the people to strengthen the struggle against the Stroessner dictatorship.

The declaration pointed out that U.S. imperialism is carrying out a conspiracy to isolate and divide the patriotic forces of the Paraguayan nation and to strengthen the power of its lackeys. The declaration emphasized that the people's demand for a thorough reform of Paraguay and the realization of national liberation requires the unity of all patriotic people.

The declaration pointed out that the examples of Cuba and Venezuela prove that the people of Latin America have enough power to overthrow all military dictatorships that are colluding with U.S. imperialism, no matter how strong they may seem.
