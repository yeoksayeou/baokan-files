Xinhua News Agency report: Oilseed rape stalks and pod husks are good fodder for pigs. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently instructed all localities to make full use of them to feed pigs.

According to analysis, oilseed rape stalks and pod husks contain abundant nutrients. The fodder made from oilseed rape stalks and pod husks contains 14 grams of crude protein per kilogram, while the better green fodder, water hyacinth, contains only 11.6 grams. This kind of fodder also contains a lot of fat, making it even more suitable as feed during the fattening period for larger pigs. There are two preparation methods: one is to grind them into powder and cook them before feeding the pigs. The other is the limewater calcification method.

    油菜秆和荚壳是好饲料
    据新华社讯　油菜秆、菜荚壳是猪的好饲料。中共浙江省委最近指示各地要充分利用它们喂猪。
    据分析，油菜秆和荚壳所含的养分很丰富。用油菜秆、荚壳制成的饲料，一公斤中含有粗蛋白质十四克，而青饲料中比较好的水浮莲只有十一点六克。这种饲料还含有很多脂肪，作大猪肥膘期间的饲料更为合适。制法有两种：一种是把它们磨成粉末，煮熟喂猪。另一种是用淡石灰水钙化法。
