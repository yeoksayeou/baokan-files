Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 27th: Water levels in the North River, West River, and river network areas of the Pearl River Delta continued to drop today. In many places, water levels have receded to or near the warning level. Starting today, on all key flood control lines, except for professional flood prevention teams remaining on the dikes for guard duty and patrols, the vast majority of manpower has left the dikes and is engaged in the battle to rush-harvest and plant, and to eliminate waterlogging and ponding.

The water level near Qingyuan County town on the North River, after receding below the warning level at 8:00 AM yesterday, continued to drop, reaching 11.75 meters at 8:00 AM today. Near Gao Yao city, the water level reached 10.37 meters at 8:00 AM today, 1.37 meters above the warning level. It is expected to recede to the warning level around the 29th. Due to rain in Guiping area of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region upstream of the West River, the water level near Gao Yao city will remain around the warning level for three or four days before receding. In some areas of the Pearl River Delta river network, water levels have receded or are about to recede to the warning level. For example, at the Shakou section of the Zhongshun Grand Embankment, which is representative of water level changes, the water level was already below the warning level at 12:00 noon today. The water level at Sangyuan Embankment in Fanshun County at 12:00 noon was only 0.38 meters above the warning level. It is expected that water levels in all rivers in the river network area will recede below the warning level by the 30th.

In the Pearl River Delta river network area, after the flood peak has passed, cadres and masses at all dikes are now concentrating their efforts on eliminating ponding, while also accelerating the rush harvest of early rice and other summer crops.

    广东各江河水位继续下降
    防汛大军大部转入抢收抢种
    新华社广州27日电　北江、西江和珠江三角洲河网地带各江河水位今天继续下降，许多地方的水位已退到或接近警戒水位。从今天起，各重点防洪线，除留下专业防汛队伍继续在堤围上守护、巡逻以外，绝大部分人力已经下堤，投入抢收抢种和排除内涝渍水的战斗。
    北江清远县城附近的水位，在昨日上午八时退到警戒水位以下以后，仍在继续下降，今天上午八时已经降到十一点七五公尺。高要城附近的水位，今日上午八时已经退到一零点三七公尺，比警戒水位还高一点三七公尺，预计29日可退到警戒水位上下；由于西江上游广西僮族自治区桂平一带下雨，高要城附近的水位，将在警戒水位上下停滞三、四天才能下退。珠江三角洲河网地带有些地区的水位，已经退到或即将退到警戒水位，如水位变化有代表性的中顺大围沙口段，今日中午十二时水位已经低于警戒水位，番顺县桑园围十二时的水位只比警戒水位高零点三八公尺。预计河网地带各江河水位都将于30日全部退至警戒水位以下。
    珠江三角洲河网地区在洪峰过去后，目前各堤围的干部和群众，正集中力量排除渍水，同时加紧抢收早稻等夏收作物。
