	Telescopes and Microscopes
	He Qing
	Comrade Mao Zedong, when discussing the strategic issues of the Chinese revolution twenty-three years ago, once said: "Our eyesight is not good enough, we should use telescopes and microscopes. The Marxist method is the political and military telescope and microscope." This passage was aimed at some people during the Second Revolutionary Civil War who were short-sighted and lacked understanding of certain strategic issues. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong criticized them for "looking at problems only from a partial perspective, lacking the ability to see the overall situation, unwilling to link today's interests with tomorrow's interests, and linking partial interests with overall interests, stubbornly clinging to things of a local and temporary nature." These words illustrate a universal Marxist-Leninist truth: we must use the viewpoint of materialist dialectics to look at problems. Therefore, reading it today, we still find it very relevant, and its truth shines brightly.
	Telescopes and microscopes are the crystallization of human wisdom and important tools for scientific research. The former can shorten the distance in space, and the latter can magnify the volume of objects; these are all for the same purpose: to enable people to see objects that cannot be seen with the naked eye. The analogy of telescopes and microscopes to the Marxist method—materialist dialectics—is very appropriate and vivid. The world's largest telescopes today can see extragalactic galaxies five hundred million light-years away from us; electron microscopes can magnify objects 100,000 times or more, making "observing the tip of an autumn hair" no longer a problem. This makes us vividly realize that the Marxist method is the science that sees the farthest and analyzes problems most clearly.
	However, we should not be limited to the most general explanation of the analogy. Although telescopes and microscopes are remarkable scientific instruments, they are only things, created by people and must be controlled and manipulated by people; while materialist dialectics is the most advanced class in human history—the working class’s most vibrant and sharp weapon. Telescopes and microscopes can only be used for specific needs, and their effectiveness can only reach a certain limit in a certain period; while the Marxist method is a universally applicable science that can insight into all problems and will never become obsolete.
	As long as we pay a little attention and think about it, the decisions and measures of our Party Central Committee are vivid embodiments of materialist dialectics and are the result of using materialist dialectics; at the same time, we often personally experience that when we deviate from materialist dialectics and develop a metaphysical viewpoint, our minds become unclear, and our work will encounter setbacks. The commonly discussed issues of strategically despising the enemy and tactically valuing the enemy, production and life, hard work and rest, centralization and democracy, discipline and freedom, heavy industry and light industry, the invincibility of new things, and "the whole country as one chessboard," etc., which problem can be correctly solved only by mastering the "political and military telescope and microscope," and only by viewing the overall situation and having a broad vision? Some people bow their heads or are blindly optimistic in the face of difficulties, or one-sidedly emphasize life, rest, democracy, and freedom, or, on the contrary, simply emphasize the other side. The reasons may be more than one, but from the perspective of ideological methods, they are all due to violations or lack of materialist dialectics, and they are all due to committing metaphysical errors. Taking "the whole country as one chessboard" as an example, this is a vivid expression of the organic combination of various economic relations in our socialist society, and it is a reflection of the requirements of the objective laws of socialist economic construction; while departmentalism is precisely a mistake that violates the requirements of this objective law, only seeing the trees and not the forest, only seeing today and not tomorrow. The foundation of capitalism is the capitalist private ownership of the means of production, and the relationship between its production and various parts and departments must be a state of anarchy and deceit; but in our socialist society, due to socialist public ownership and the vigorous communist spirit of the people across the country, "the whole country as one chessboard" is not only a moral fashion that should be promoted, but also a characteristic of the socialist economy, and a reflection of the objective laws of the planned and proportionate development of the national economy. People who do not respect materialism and dialectics, people who engage in departmentalism and decentralism, will inevitably encounter setbacks here.
	Therefore, everyone must be equipped with a political telescope and microscope, the more precise and accurate the better; and they must always be kept bright and free from dust.

    望远镜与显微镜
    贺青
    毛泽东同志二十三年前论述中国革命的战略问题时，曾经说过：“我们的眼力不够，应该借助于望远镜和显微镜。马克思主义的方法就是政治上军事上的望远镜和显微镜。”这一段话，是针对第二次国内革命战争中，有些人目光短浅，对某些战略问题缺乏认识而说的。当时毛泽东同志批评他们“看问题仅从一局部出发，没有能力通观全局，不愿把今天的利益和明天的的利益相联结，把部分利益和全体利益相联结，捉住一局部一时间的东西死也不放”。这些话说明了一个马列主义的普遍真理：必须运用唯物辩证法的观点看问题。因此，今天读来，我们仍然觉得它十分亲切，它那真理的光辉，灿烂夺目。
    望远镜和显微镜，是人类智慧的结晶，是科学研究的重要工具。前者可以缩短空间的距离，后者可以放大物体的体积；这些，都是为了同样的目的：使人们能够看清楚肉眼所无法看见的物体。把望远镜和显微镜喻为马克思主义的方法——唯物辩证法，是十分恰切和形象化的。现在世界上最大的望远镜，可以看到离我们五亿光年的河外星系；电子显微镜，可以把物体放大十万倍或更大，使得“明察秋毫之末”早已不成其为难题。这就使我们生动地形象地领会到，马克思主义的方法乃是看得最远，分析问题最清楚的科学。
    但是，我们不应拘泥于比喻的最一般的说明。望远镜和显微镜虽然都是了不起的科学仪器，但它们都不过只是一种物，是由人们所创造而又必须由人们加以控制和操纵的物；而唯物辩证法，则是人类历史上最先进的阶级——工人阶级的最富于生命力的和最犀利的武器。望远镜和显微镜，都只能用于特定的需要方面，并且在一定时期它的效能也只能达到一定限度；而马克思主义的方法乃是放之四海而皆准的、能够洞察一切问题的、永远也不会陈旧的科学。
    只要我们稍为留意一下，想一想，我们的党中央的决定、措施，都是唯物辩证法的生动体现，并且是运用唯物辩证法的结果；同时，我们也常常切身体会到，当我们离开了唯物辩证法，滋长了形而上学观点的时候，头脑就不清醒，工作就要碰钉子。人们经常议论的战略上要藐视敌人与战术上要重视敌人、生产和生活、苦战和休整、集中和民主、纪律和自由、重工业和轻工业、新生事物不可战胜，以及“全国一盘棋”等等，哪一个问题不是只有掌握了“政治上军事上的望远镜和显微镜”，只有通观全局，高瞻远瞩才能正确解决的呢？有些人在困难面前低头或盲目乐观，或者片面强调生活、休息、民主、自由，或者完全相反，又单纯强调了另一面，原因可能不止一个，但是从思想方法方面来看，则都是由于违反或缺乏唯物辩证法所致，都是由于犯了形而上学的错误。就以“全国一盘棋”来说，这是我们社会主义社会各种经济关系有机结合的一种形象化的说法，是社会主义经济建设的客观规律的要求的反映；而本位主义，则正是违反这种客观规律的要求，只见树木不见森林，只见今天不见明天的错误思想。资本主义的基础由于是生产资料的资本主义私人所有制，它的生产和各个局部、部门之间的关系，必然是无政府状态和尔虞我诈；但是我们社会主义社会，由于社会主义公有制和全国人民共产主义意气风发，“全国一盘棋”就不仅是一种应当加以提倡的道德风尚，而且是社会主义经济的特点，是国民经济有计划按比例发展的客观规律的要求的反映。不尊重唯物论，不尊重辩证法的人，闹本位主义、分散主义的人，在这里是没有不碰钉子的。
    所以，每一个人都必须配备一副政治上的望远镜和显微镜，越精密准确的就越好；并且要经常将它们擦得亮亮的，不让它们沾上一点灰尘。
