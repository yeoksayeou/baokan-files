Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, June 10th: At today's meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, the chief representative of the Korean-Chinese side, Major General Zhu Changjun, strongly demanded that the American side immediately remove the atomic weapons, missiles, and other military equipment illegally brought into South Korea, and withdraw the American troops stationed in South Korea.

At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that the American side, on the one hand, refuses to accept the just proposal of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of the country, which calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and for the Korean people to solve the Korean issue themselves. On the other hand, it violates the armistice agreement by expelling the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea, moving the "United Nations Command" headquarters to South Korea, and bringing new weapons such as F-100 jet aircraft, "Honest John" rocket battalions, atomic cannons, and "Matador" missiles into South Korea. He further pointed out that since April of this year, the American side, together with the Syngman Rhee puppet army, has successively held "reinforced atomic warfare amphibious operation exercises" and so-called "largest-scale ROK-U.S. joint amphibious operation exercises" since the Korean War. The American side also frequently dispatches military aircraft and armed ships to intrude into the airspace and coastal areas of the Korean-Chinese side for provocative activities, attempting to intensify the tense situation in Korea and turn South Korea into an American colony and "atomic forward assault base."

Major General Zhu Changjun said that the Korean people will never allow all these provocative and aggressive acts by the American side. In order to consolidate the armistice and eliminate the threat to peace in Korea, we firmly demand that the American side immediately stop such outrageous provocative activities and remove the atomic weapons, missiles, and other new weapons illegally brought into South Korea from South Korea. At the same time, in order for the Korean people to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country themselves without any external interference, we demand that the American side immediately withdraw the American troops stationed in South Korea.

The American representative at the meeting refused to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, using the excuse that the Military Armistice Commission had no right to discuss it. He also resorted to fallacies such as maintaining military "balance" and "defense" to justify that the American side's introduction of military weapons into South Korea and expansion of military strength was "fair," and refused to remove the atomic weapons illegally brought into South Korea by the American side and refused to withdraw American troops from South Korea.

At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun immediately sternly refuted the American side's fallacy of maintaining "balance" with the fact that when the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reduced its army by 80,000 troops and the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea, the Syngman Rhee clique instead expanded its army and strengthened the American forces remaining in South Korea.

Major General Zhu Changjun then comprehensively exposed the American side's systematic crimes of undermining the armistice agreement, listing facts such as the American side's forcible detention of captured personnel and displaced civilians from the Korean-Chinese side, the introduction of new weapons, and the undermining of the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and refuted the lies told by the American representative at the meeting that the American side had not violated the armistice agreement.

At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun repeatedly suggested discussing the issue of the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and the removal of new weapons illegally brought into South Korea. The American representative at the meeting was at a loss for words but shamelessly acted like a rogue, stubbornly refusing the demands and suggestions of the Korean-Chinese side. He repeatedly suggested adjourning the meeting in an attempt to avoid discussion and shamelessly slandered the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Major General Zhu Changjun finally denounced the American side's unreasonable attitude.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 10th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Ri Hyo-soon, chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, in a statement issued on the 8th, demanded that the American invading forces immediately and completely withdraw from South Korea. Ri Hyo-soon emphasized that the current state of division that still exists in Korea is caused by the American imperialists' occupation of South Korea.

    朝中代表在朝鲜停战委员会上强硬要求
    撤退美国军队  运走原子武器
    新华社板门店10日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将今天在委员会的会议上强硬要求美方立即运出非法运入南朝鲜的原子武器和导弹等军事装备，撤走驻在南朝鲜的美国军队。
    朱昌骏少将在会上指出，美方一方面拒不接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为国家的和平统一所提出的从南北朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和让朝鲜人民自己来解决朝鲜问题的正当建议，另一方面违反停战协定，把中立国视察小组逐出南朝鲜，把“联合国军”司令部迁到南朝鲜，把F一○○喷气式飞机、“诚实的约翰”火箭营、原子大炮、“斗牛士式”导弹等新式武器运入南朝鲜。他又指出，今年4月以来，美方又和李承晚伪军一起先后举行“加强原子战两栖作战演习”和所谓侵朝战争以来“最大规模的韩美联合两栖作战演习”，美方还经常派遣军用飞机和武装船只侵入朝中方面地区上空和沿海进行挑衅活动，企图加剧朝鲜紧张局势，把南朝鲜变为美国殖民地和“原子前哨突击基地”。
    朱昌骏少将说，朝鲜人民决不容许美方的这一切挑衅侵略行为。为了巩固停战，消除对朝鲜和平的威胁，坚决要求美方立即停止这种放肆的挑衅活动，把非法运入南朝鲜的原子武器和导弹等各种新式武器运出南朝鲜；同时，为了在没有任何外来干涉的情况下由朝鲜人民自己来实现国家的和平统一，要求美方立即撤出驻在南朝鲜的美国军队。
    美方代表在会上以军事停战委员会无权讨论为借口，拒绝讨论美军撤出南朝鲜问题。他又以为了保持军力的“均衡”，为了“防御”等谰调辩解说，美方向南朝鲜运入军事武器，扩大军事力量是“公平”的，并且拒绝运出美方非法运入南朝鲜的原子武器，拒绝从南朝鲜撤出美军。
    朱昌骏少将在会上当即以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府缩减八万军队和中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜时，美李集团反而扩军和加强留在南朝鲜的美军力量的事实，严正驳斥了美方保持“均衡”的谰言。
    朱昌骏少将接着全面地揭露了美方有系统地破坏停战协定的罪行，列举美方强迫扣留朝中方面被俘人员和失所平民、运入新式武器、破坏中立国监察委员会的工作等事实，驳斥美方代表在会上所说的美方没有违反停战协定的谎言。
    朱昌骏少将在会上一再建议讨论美军撤出南朝鲜和运出非法运入南朝鲜的新式武器问题。美方代表在会上理屈词穷，但厚着脸皮耍赖，顽固地拒绝朝中方面的要求和建议。他一再建议休会，企图逃避讨论，并无耻地对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行诬蔑。朱昌骏少将最后痛斥了美方这种无理的态度。
    据新华社平壤10日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜职业总同盟委员长李孝淳在8日发表的一项声明中，要求美国侵略军队立即全部撤出南朝鲜。李孝淳强调指出，朝鲜目前仍然存在的分裂状态是美帝国主义强占南朝鲜所造成的。
