Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 30th—The iron smelting workshop of the Shuicheng Steel Plant in Guizhou Province overfulfilled its May pig iron production plan by the 28th. The five small blast furnaces in the entire workshop, with a total volume of 103 cubic meters, produced a total of 3,201 tons of pig iron. After testing, all of these pig irons were qualified, with first and second grade products accounting for more than 80%.

	In May, this workshop continuously improved its production management. Based on their April experiences, the workers established a responsibility system, formulated systems for equipment maintenance and repair and shift handover, and earnestly implemented them; at the same time, they launched a socialist labor competition of "comparing quality, comparing output, comparing innovation, comparing cost, comparing safety, and comparing collaboration." Therefore, the production situation this month has been good, and the output has been increasing day by day. The average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reached 1.281 in the last ten days of the month; coke consumption and costs have continued to decline, with an average of 0.93 tons of coke being used to produce one ton of pig iron in the last ten days of the month.

    提前完成生铁计划
    新华社贵阳30日电　贵州省水城钢铁厂炼铁车间到28日超额完成了5月份的生铁生产计划。全车间五座容积共一百零三立方公尺的小高炉，共出产生铁三千二百零一吨。经过化验，这些生铁全部合格，一、二级品占80％以上。
    5月份，这个车间不断改进了生产管理。职工们根据4月份的经验，建立了责任制，订出了设备维护修理和交接班等制度，认真贯彻执行；同时开展了“比质量、比产量、比革新、比成本、比安全、比协作”的社会主义劳动竞赛。因此，这个月的生产情况一直良好，产量一天比一天高，高炉平均利用系数下旬达到一点二八一；焦炭消耗量和成本都不断下降，下旬平均每零点九三吨焦炭就炼一吨生铁。
