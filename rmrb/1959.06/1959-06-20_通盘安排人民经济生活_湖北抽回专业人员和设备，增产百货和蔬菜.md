    This dispatch from our newspaper in Wuhan, dated the 19th, reports that Party committees at all levels in Hubei Province are comprehensively strengthening their leadership over work related to the people's economic life. A new atmosphere is beginning to emerge in market supply in some areas.

    Since May and June, the Standing Committee of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and a leading group headed by Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Governor, have convened meetings to study measures for strengthening economic work and comprehensively caring for the people's lives ideologically and organizationally, and decided to implement them immediately. The Provincial Party Committee instructed all localities to basically return all professional and technical personnel and equipment, etc., that were transferred from financial and trade organizations and handicraft departments in 1958 to their original posts. As of now, more than 4,460 financial and trade cadres have returned to their posts in various regions. By the end of June, more than 10,000 transferred financial and trade cadres will have returned to their posts successively. The work of returning personnel in the handicraft sector is also actively underway.

    In order to meet the diverse needs of the people for daily necessities, relevant departments, in accordance with the decision of the Provincial Party Committee, are gradually allocating steel, copper, silicon steel sheets, magnesium, zinc, yarn-covered wire, enameled wire, cast iron, wood, nan bamboo, and cotton yarn to Wuhan and other places as raw materials and materials for the production of various daily necessities. The Wuhan General Merchandise Wholesale Station and the Waste Products Wholesale Department also organized a shock team that went deep into sixteen warehouses and shops in six districts and cleared out more than 69 tons of various raw materials and materials in three days.

    In order to organize the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, promote mutual exchange and make up for what the other lacks, and adjust market needs, three types of materials exchange fairs were held successively in various parts of the province during the second quarter. Recently, the province held a first and second category materials balance adjustment and exchange conference. Through inventory checks, enterprises have transferred a large number of stagnant materials for use in current production. According to preliminary statistics, the steel that has been cleared and transferred is equivalent to approximately 44.5% of the state's allocation to the province in 1958, and a large amount of other materials have also been transferred. This has played a significant role in organizing production and meeting market needs.

    In order to further improve the supply of non-staple foods, in addition to vigorously developing vegetable production in the suburbs, efforts are being made to carry out fish harvesting and livestock and poultry breeding. Party committees at all levels in Wuhan City have equipped themselves with specialized teams to vigorously promote the production of non-staple foods. The Dongxihu Farm has decided to expand the area under vegetable cultivation and has made specific arrangements for the varieties and time of harvesting to production teams. Communes in the suburbs are also actively rushing to plant fast-maturing vegetables. In Shashi and Xiangfan cities, a mass movement is underway, focusing on vegetable cultivation and vigorously developing non-staple food production.

    Through this period of effort, economic work in various places is becoming increasingly active, and a new atmosphere has emerged in market supply in some areas. In Wuhan City, the general merchandise station alone has arranged the production of 43 varieties of daily-use general merchandise; various districts have also arranged the production of hundreds of kinds of daily-use sundries. Some have already begun to enter the market. In early June, the total output value of daily necessities produced in Chengguan Town, Echeng County, increased by more than 20% compared with late May. In the market of Huangzhou Town, Huanggang Prefecture, more than 50 kinds of small daily necessities such as kitchen knives were added within three days, basically meeting the local needs.

    通盘安排人民经济生活
    湖北抽回专业人员和设备，增产百货和蔬菜
    本报武汉19日电　湖北省各级党委全面加强对有关人民经济生活工作的领导。部分地区的市场供应开始出现新气象。
    5月、6月份以来，湖北省委常委和以省委书记、省长张体学为首的领导小组，接连召开了会议，从思想上、组织上研究了加强经济工作，全面关心人民生活的措施，并且决定立即实行。省委指示各地将1958年从财贸机构和手工业部门抽走的专业技术人员和设备等，基本上全部调回原岗位。到目前为止，各专区财贸干部归队的已有四千四百六十多人。6月底以前，一万多名被抽调的财贸干部，将全部陆续归队。手工业部门的归队工作也在积极进行。
    为了满足人民群众对生活日用品的多种多样的需要，有关部门根据省委的决定，正陆续拨给武汉等地钢材、铜、矽钢片、镁、锌、纱包线、漆包线、铸造生铁、木材、楠竹及棉纱，作为生产各种日用品的原料和材料。武汉百货批发站和废品批发部还组织了一支突击队伍，分别深入六个区的十六个仓库、商店，三天清出各种原料、材料六十九吨多。
    为了组织城乡物资交流，互通有无和调剂市场需要，第二季度内，全省各地陆续召开了三类物资交流会。最近，全省又召开了一、二类物资平衡调剂交流大会。各企业通过清仓普查，调出了大批呆滞物资用到当前生产中去。据初步统计，已经清理和调剂出的钢材，约相当于1958年国家分配给全省的指标的44.5％，调剂出的其他物资也很多。这对组织生产、满足市场需要，起了很大的作用。
    在进一步改善副食品供应方面，各地除大力发展城郊蔬菜生产外，正在开展鱼类的捕捞和家畜家禽的饲养工作。武汉市各级党委都配备了专业班子，大抓副食品生产。东西湖农场决定扩大蔬菜种植面积，并已把品种、出菜时间等具体安排到生产小队；城郊各公社也正积极抢种快熟蔬菜。在沙市和襄樊市，正在开展一个群众性的以种菜为主，大力发展副食品生产的群众运动。
    经过这一时期的努力，各地经济工作正在日益活跃，部分地区的市场供应已随着出现了新的气象。在武汉市，仅百货站已经安排生产的日用百货就有四十三个品种；各区还安排了数百种日用杂品的生产。有的已经开始上市。鄂城县城关6月上旬日用品生产的总产值比5月下旬增加了20％以上。黄冈专区黄州镇的市场，三天内便增加菜刀等细小日用品五十多种，基本上满足了本地的需要。（附图片）
