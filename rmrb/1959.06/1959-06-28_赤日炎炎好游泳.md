In the scorching summer, swimming enthusiasts naturally yearn for the shimmering beaches, riverbanks, lakesides, and swimming pools.

In primitive times, swimming was a human survival instinct. With the development of productivity, humans no longer needed to swim to catch fish, and this instinct gradually faded. However, as a special skill or a method of physical exercise, swimming has always been passed down in human society. From the murals excavated in Dunhuang, we can see scenes of ancient people swimming.

Today, the state has listed swimming as an important sport to be developed.

The reason why swimming is so popular is not accidental. In addition to the benefits of general exercise, it also has its own characteristics:

When swimming, the body comes into contact with a large amount of air, sunlight, and water, which can enhance the body's resistance to the natural environment. Cholesterol in the skin is irradiated by sunlight to produce large amounts of vitamin D. People who regularly swim in winter can even appear in icy rivers like seals, unaware of the meaning of cold and disease.

When swimming, water exerts a pressure of about 12 to 15 kilograms on the chest cavity. Therefore, when inhaling, one needs to constantly overcome this resistance. Regular exercise makes the respiratory organs particularly strong. The average person's vital capacity is 3.5 to 4 liters, while excellent swimmers can reach 6 or 7 liters or more.

Swimming is both a tense and vigorous, and a slow and relaxing exercise, suitable for people of all ages, physiques, and genders. This is because when people move in water, they have to overcome much greater resistance than in air. For example, when swimming quickly, the body has to overcome about 12 kilograms of resistance, and the energy consumption is ten times greater than when at rest on land. Therefore, this is a tense and vigorous physical exercise. On the other hand, due to the buoyancy of water, people lose a lot of weight in the water, with their body weight only remaining at 2 or 3 kilograms. Therefore, as long as one is familiar with the water, the muscles do not need to work intensely to control the body's balance and use buoyancy to move forward and backward. Therefore, the strong can brave the wind and waves and cross the sea and rivers; the elderly and weak can also float leisurely and swim slowly in the middle of the stream.

After modern swimming became an internationally popular competition, technology developed rapidly, creating many styles. At the beginning of swimming competitions, the style was free, but most people adopted a posture similar to crawling, so "freestyle" became synonymous with crawl. Some people noticed that frogs are quadrupedal animals that swim quickly in the water, which is very suitable for people to imitate, so they created the "breaststroke". In recent years, scientists have studied that fish swim very fast, and the main driving force comes from the swing of the tail, while human lower limbs can imitate the fish tail to swing up and down, which has created the "dolphin style" (named because the swimming posture is similar to that of a dolphin). There are also other derived styles such as backstroke, underwater swimming, and sidestroke.

Freestyle and breaststroke are the most common and are the entry points for beginners. The former is fast but consumes a lot of energy, while the latter is slower but consumes less energy. Beginners can choose a style that suits their physical strength.

Water conducts heat twenty-nine times faster than air, so beginners should not remain still in the water for a long time to avoid excessive heat loss and catching a cold. Children have thinner skin, and the elderly have less subcutaneous fat, making it easier to lose body temperature, so they should pay more attention. Women should also not go into the water during menstruation.

In places with polluted water quality, or where schistosomiasis or infectious diseases are prevalent, one should not swim in rivers to avoid infection.

### 赤日炎炎好游泳

    赤日炎炎好游泳
    张荣泉
    在赤日炎炎的夏天，游泳爱好者自然会向往那碧波鳞鳞的海滨、江边、湖畔和游泳池。
    在原始时代，游泳是人的一种生活本能。随着生产力的发展，人类不必用泅水的办法来捕鱼了，这种本能就逐渐退化。不过，作为一种特殊技能或锻炼身体的方法，游泳始终在人类社会中流传着。从敦煌发掘出来的壁画中，可以看到古代人游泳的画面。
    游泳至于今天，国家把它列为一个重要的运动项目来开展。
    游泳之如此引人喜爱，不是偶然的。它除了具有一般运动的益处外，还有自己的特点：
    游泳时，身体同大量的空气、日光和水接触，能够增强人体对自然环境的抵抗能力，皮肤中的胆固醇经日光照射，会生成大量的维生素丁。经常坚持冬季游泳的人，甚至可以像海豹一样在冰河中出没，不知寒冻疾病为何物。
    游泳时，水对胸廓约有十二至十五公斤的压力，因此，在吸气时需不断克服这种阻力。经常这样锻炼，呼吸器管就变得特别强大。普通人肺活量是三点五至四公升，优秀的游泳运动员可达六、七公升以上。
    游泳是既紧张猛烈而又舒徐轻松的一种运动，宜乎各种年龄、体质、性别的人参加。这是因为，人在水中活动，要克服比空气大得多的阻力，如用快速游进，身体大约要克服十二公斤的阻力，能量消耗比陆上安静时要大十倍，因而这是一项紧张猛烈的体育锻炼。另一方面，由于水的浮力，人在水中要失去很多重量，体重只剩二、三公斤，因此，只要熟谙水性，肌肉不必强度的劳动就能控制身体平衡，利用浮力进退运转。所以身强力壮者可以乘风破浪、跨海渡江；年衰体弱者也可以悠浮缓游、放乎中流。
    近代游泳运动成为国际流行的竞赛项目后，技术发展很快，创造了许多姿势。在开始举办游泳比赛时，姿势可以自由，但大多数人都采取类似匍匐爬行的姿势，因此“自由泳”就成了爬泳的代名词。有些人注意到青蛙是四肢动物，在水中游动神速，很宜于人去模仿，于是又创造了“蛙泳”。近年来科学家们研究了鱼类的游速很快，鱼的主要推动力出于尾巴的摆动，而人的下肢可以模仿鱼尾作上下摆动，这又创造了“海豚式”（因泳姿类似海豚而得名）。其它还有繁衍派生的仰泳、潜泳、侧泳等等。
    自由泳和蛙泳最普遍，也是初学游泳者入门之道。前者速度快，但消耗体力大，后者速度较慢，但体力消耗较少。初学游泳者可量力而选择适合自己体力的姿势。
    水比空气导热快二十九倍，因此初学者不应长期静止地浸在水中，以免失温过多而受凉。小孩皮肤较薄，老人皮下脂肪较少，都容易散发体温，更应注意。妇女月经期间，也不应下水。
    在水质污浊、或有血吸虫、传染病流行的地方，不应在江河中游泳，以免传染。
