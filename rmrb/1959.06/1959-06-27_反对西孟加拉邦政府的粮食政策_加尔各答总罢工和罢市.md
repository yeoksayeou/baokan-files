Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 26th: A 24-hour general strike and market strike was held in Calcutta (in West Bengal), India's largest city, on the 25th to protest the food policy of the West Bengal government.

This strike and market strike movement was initiated by the "Anti-Price Rise and Anti-Famine Committee" composed of left-wing parties in West Bengal. The Congress Party and the People's Socialist Party did not participate in this movement.

According to today's "Indian Times" report, trams and buses on the streets of Calcutta have stopped running, railway traffic has been interrupted, and most shops are closed.

On the evening of the 25th, a public gathering with many participants was held in the city and passed a resolution demanding that the government supply rice at reasonable prices. Some speakers demanded the resignation of the state government led by the Congress Party.

According to the Indian News Agency, West Bengal needs approximately 4.4 million tons of food annually and is short 950,000 tons this year. The price of rice in rural and urban markets has risen to 35 and 40 rupees per maund respectively, while the official price is 21.6 rupees.

Prior to the strike on the 25th, a series of mass rallies and demonstrations were held throughout West Bengal last week.

    反对西孟加拉邦政府的粮食政策
    加尔各答总罢工和罢市
    新华社新德里26日电　印度第一大城市加尔各答（在西孟加拉邦）在25日举行了二十四小时的总罢工和罢市，反对西孟加拉邦政府的粮食政策。
    这次罢工罢市运动是由西孟加拉邦的左翼政党组成的“反涨价和反饥荒委员会”发起的。国大党和人民社会党没有参加这次运动。
    据“印度时报”今天报道，加尔各答街上的电车汽车都已停驶，铁路交通中断，大多数商店关门。
    25日晚上，市内举行了有许多人参加的公众集会，并通过决议，要求政府以合理的价格供应大米。一些发言者要求国大党领导的邦政府辞职。
    据印度新闻社报道，西孟加拉邦每年需要大约四百四十万吨粮食，今年缺少九十五万吨。农村和城市市场上的大米价格每芒特已经分别上涨到三十五和四十卢比，而官价是二十一点六卢比。
    在25日的罢工以前，上星期在西孟加拉邦各地举行了一系列的群众大会和示威。
