Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 11th—A nationwide herbal medicine and materials exchange fair was held in Anguo County, Hebei, from the end of May to the beginning of June. Representatives from herbal medicine management and cultivation departments in more than twenty provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country participated.

Anguo County is a famous city for processing and distributing Chinese herbal medicines. For over a hundred years, whenever the season for Chinese herbal medicines comes in summer and autumn, merchants from all over the country have gathered here to trade herbal medicines. After liberation, this traditional commercial activity developed into a trade fair format, conducted in a planned and organized manner.

At the exchange fair, representatives from various regions exchanged information on the supply and demand of local herbal medicine markets and tapped into potential from various aspects, offering products to support other regions. After learning that various regions urgently needed cassia twigs, a type of herbal medicine, the representatives from Guangdong Province proactively sold more than 50,000 jin to various regions. Beijing urgently needed Perilla leaves, so the representatives from Hebei Province proactively signed a purchase and sales contract with the Beijing representatives for 100,000 jin of Perilla leaves and immediately allocated more than 1,000 jin of processed stock. Representatives from various regions in the southwest bought more than 50,000 jin of Spatholobus suberectus, used to prevent miasma, and the market supply situation will be improved.

Through the exchange, representatives from various regions signed a total of more than 850 purchase and sales contracts, mutually adjusting and exchanging more than 8,790,000 jin of herbal medicines and more than 3,820,000 boxes of prepared medicines, with a total value of more than 9,500,000 yuan. About one-third of this was spot trading. Representatives from many regions have made preliminary plans to expand the planting and collection of herbal medicines according to contract requirements.

    药材交流会在安国举行
    据新华社天津11日电　5月末6月初，在河北安国县召开了一次带有全国性的药材物资交流会。全国二十多个省、市、自治区的中药材经营种植部门，都派有代表参加。
    安国县是著名的中药材加工集散城市。一百多年来，每当夏秋中药上市季节，全国各地的药商就齐集这里，进行药材交易。解放以后，这个传统的商业活动发展成为交易会形式，有计划有领导地进行。
    在交流会上，各地代表交换了当地药材市场的供销情况，并从多方面挖掘潜力，拿出产品，支援外地。广东省的代表了解到各地迫切需要桂枝这种药材，就主动卖给各地五万多斤。北京市急需苏叶，河北省代表便主动与北京代表签订了十万斤苏叶的购销合同，并且马上拨给一千多斤加工后的现货。西南各地代表在会上买到了五万多斤防治瘴气的芜夷，市场供应情况将得到改善。
    经过交流，各地代表共签订了八百五十多份购销合同，相互调剂药材八百七十九万多斤，成药三百八十二万多盒，总值共九百五十多万元。其中有三分之一左右是现货交易。许多地区的代表根据合同要求，作出了扩大种植和采集药材的初步计划。
