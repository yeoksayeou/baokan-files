No Eggs Without Chickens
    Jincheng Egg Factory Assists Nearby Communes in Developing Chicken Farming
    (Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch, 31st) The Jincheng Egg Factory in Shanxi is helping nearby rural people's communes raise chickens. This not only helps the people's communes develop sideline production, but also fundamentally solves the problem of insufficient raw materials for the factory.
    Since its establishment in 1949, the Jincheng Egg Factory has constantly encountered the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. Although various methods were tried, the problem was never completely solved. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the Party Committee of the egg factory mobilized all employees to find solutions. Some employees said: To eat fruit, you must first plant trees; to eat eggs, you must first raise chickens. Eggs come from the countryside, how can we have eggs if we don't vigorously help farmers raise chickens?
    The problem was found, and the direction was clear. After analyzing the situation in the countryside, they decided to take two measures: one was to help the communes establish chicken farms, and the other was to promote superior breeds of chickens such as Leghorn, Australian Black, and Jiujin Yellow. According to the above measures, the egg factory sent people to Tianjin to purchase high-quality hatching eggs, and also launched a publicity campaign. They printed leaflets, held exhibitions, and convened farmers' symposiums. Subsequently, they started three chicken farms as pilot projects in the factory, Jincun, and Shuidong. The commune members saw with their own eyes that the superior breeds of chickens were fat and strong, and laid eggs that were both numerous and large, and they asked the egg factory to support them with superior breeds and help the communes raise chickens. In this way, seventeen chicken farms were quickly established. Each farm raises about 5,000 chickens. In order to help the communes improve their breeding techniques, the egg factory also held training classes. In addition, technicians are often sent to the countryside to help improve breeding techniques.
    After adopting this method, the problem of raw materials has been basically solved.

    有鸡才有蛋
    晋城蛋厂协助附近公社发展养鸡业
    本报太原31电　山西晋城蛋厂帮助附近农村人民公社养鸡。这样做既帮助人民公社发展了副业生产，又从根本上解决了本厂原料不足的问题。
    晋城蛋厂从1949年建厂以来，不断遇到原料不足的困难。虽然也曾多方设法，但总没有彻底地得到解决。去年大跃进中，蛋厂党委就发动全体职工想办法。有的职工们说：要吃果子就得先种树，要吃鸡蛋就得先养鸡。蛋从农村来，不大力帮助农民养鸡，怎能会有蛋呢？
    问题找到了，方向也明确了，他们分析了农村的情况，于是他们便决定采取两条措施：一条是帮助公社建立养鸡场；一是推广来亨、澳洲黑、九斤黄等优良鸡种。根据上述措施，蛋厂一面派人到天津收购良种蛋，一方面开展了宣传运动。他们印发了传单举办了展览会，召开了农民座谈会。随后，在本厂、金村和水东三地搞起了三个养鸡场，进行试点。社员们亲眼看到了优良种鸡，身肥体壮，产蛋又多又大，纷纷要求蛋厂支援优良鸡种，帮助公社养鸡。这样，很快就办起了十七个养鸡场。每个厂养鸡五千只左右。为了帮助公社提高饲养技术，蛋厂还举办了训练班。此外，经常派技术人员下乡帮助提高饲养技术。
    采取这种办法后，原料问题基本上得到解决。（附图片）
