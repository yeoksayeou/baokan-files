The parties and political exile organizations opposed to the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua have jointly formed the "Nicaraguan Revolutionary Alliance" and announced their political program.

According to Venezuela's "El Nacional," representatives from Nicaragua's Republican Mobilization Party, Christian Social Party, National Renovation Party, Socialist Party (Communist Party), and Independent Liberal Party recently held a secret meeting in Nicaragua. The meeting decided to organize the "Nicaraguan Revolutionary Alliance." In addition to the above political parties, the "Nicaraguan Patriotic Union" and some Nicaraguan political exile organizations also participated in the alliance.

In its declaration of principles, the "Nicaraguan Revolutionary Alliance" announced that the alliance's goal is to overthrow the shameless oppressive regime and replace it with a regime that guarantees political, economic, social, and spiritual liberation. The alliance also put forward programs such as safeguarding national sovereignty, realizing democracy, and land reform.

The news said that Guillermo Urbina Vasquez, chairman of the "Nicaraguan Revolutionary Alliance," pointed out in a speech before the outbreak of the anti-Somoza armed struggle in Nicaragua that the uprising in his motherland would be an internal affair, and those involved would be exiles fighting to defend their homeland. Urbina Vasquez predicted at the time that the situation in Nicaragua had reached the point of eruption, because in this ravaged land, neither the urban nor rural masses, nor the bourgeoisie eager to find opportunities to improve the declining national economy, had the opportunity to survive. While exposing the Somoza family's crimes of suppressing and plundering the Nicaraguan people, Urbina Vasquez pointed out that 30,000 people had been killed during the Somoza family's 25 years of dictatorial rule in Nicaragua. He said that because the Somoza family – the widow and her three sons – monopolized the few departments that existed for personal enjoyment, the Somoza family "has $300 million in deposits in many banks around the world, which is enough to cover Nicaragua's budget for 15 years." Urbina Vasquez finally pointed out, "The dynasty's repression has begun to lose its strength and has been fatally wounded."

    “尼加拉瓜革命联盟”组成并宣布政纲
    推翻暴君　革新国家
    本报讯　尼加拉瓜各反对索摩查独裁政权的党派和一些政治流亡组织联合组成了“尼加拉瓜革命联盟”。
    据委内瑞拉“国民报”报道，不久以前，尼加拉瓜的共和动员党、天主教社会党、全国革新党、社会主义党（共产党）和独立自由党的代表，在尼加拉瓜举行了一次秘密会议。会议决定组织“尼加拉瓜革命联盟”。参加这个联盟的除了以上各个政党外，还有“尼加拉瓜爱国者联盟和尼加拉瓜的一些政治流亡组织。
      “尼加拉瓜革命联盟”在它的原则宣言中宣布，联盟的目的是推翻那无耻的压迫政权，而代之以保证政治、经济、社会和精神上获得解放的政权。这个联盟还提出了维护国家主权、实现民主和土地改革等等纲领。
    消息说，“尼加拉瓜革命联盟”主席吉列尔莫·乌尔维纳·巴斯克斯在尼加拉瓜反索摩查武装斗争爆发以前发表的一次谈话中指出，他的祖国的起义将是一桩内部事件，参与这桩事情的将是那些为保卫自己国土而斗争的流亡者。乌尔维纳·巴斯克斯当时曾预言说，尼加拉瓜的形势已经达到了爆发阶段，因为在这块被蹂躏的土地上，不论是城乡群众，还是急于寻找机会改善衰弱的国民经济的资产阶级，都没有活下去的机会了。乌尔维纳·巴斯克斯在揭露索摩查家族镇压和掠夺尼加拉瓜人民的罪行时指出，索摩查家族在尼加拉瓜二十五年独裁统治期间，有三万人被杀害。他说，由于索摩查家族——寡妇和她的三个儿子——把寥寥无几的各个部门都独占起来，归个人享用，索摩查家族“在世界上许多银行中有三亿美元的存款，也就是说，这个数量足够开支尼加拉瓜十五年的预算”。乌尔维纳·巴斯克斯最后指出，“王朝的镇压开始失去了它的力量，而受到了致命伤”。（附图片）
