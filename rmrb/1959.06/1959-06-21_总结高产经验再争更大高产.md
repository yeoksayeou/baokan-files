    Sum Up High-Yield Experiences to Strive for Even Greater High Yields
　　Zhejiang Cixi County Agricultural Bureau
    Cixi County is a cotton and spring flowering double-cropping area. In the past, rapeseed planting area only accounted for more than 2% of the total spring flowering area.

    This year, the Party committee has greatly emphasized oil production, and the county's rapeseed area has expanded from 18,000 mu in 1958 to more than 150,000 mu. Rapeseed has become the main crop for spring flowering production.

    For the past six months, under the leadership of the Party, farmers throughout the county have seized the main key points in the cultivation process, overcome natural disasters such as drought, frost, pests, and diseases, and finally achieved a large-scale bumper harvest, with an average yield of 151 jin per mu, of which more than 34,000 mu averaged more than 229 jin per mu.

    Main Technical Measures
    (1) Implement Deep Plowing and Fine Land Preparation
    As the saying goes, "An inch of winter plowing is better than a load of manure." Rapeseed is a crop with very developed branch roots. If the soil layer is deep and loose, the root system can develop well. In the past, the depth of plowing was only three or four inches, but this year, all rapeseed fields were deep-plowed to six to eight inches. Before sowing and transplanting, fine land preparation was carried out universally. Facts have proven that deep plowing is a good way to increase rapeseed production. In the county, rapeseed fields with a yield of more than 200 jin per mu were all deep-plowed to more than one chi; the high-yielding land with a yield of 612 jin per mu was deep-plowed to one chi and eight cun. The 5th team of Andong Brigade's 200 mu of rapeseed was deep-plowed to six to eight inches, with an average yield of 209 jin per mu, of which 10 mu was deep-plowed to one chi and two cun, with a yield of 408 jin per mu; the high-yielding experimental field was deep-plowed to one chi and eight cun, with a yield as high as 488 jin per mu. However, it is important to pay attention to not disrupting the soil layers and combining with increased application of base fertilizer when deep plowing.

    (2) Raise Seedlings and Transplant, Sow and Plant Early
    There are many benefits to sowing early. The local people say, "If you want oil, get started before the Cold Dew." Sowing and planting early is an experience for achieving high yields. Last year, the county's rapeseed began to raise seedlings on September 25, and peaked on October 8, ending on October 15, 10 to 15 days earlier than in previous years. This year, the area of seedling raising and transplanting reached 59.33%. Various places have summarized that seedling raising and transplanting have three major benefits: First, it can solve the contradiction between cotton and rapeseed as successive crops. Because the sowing period of rapeseed is the period when cotton is spitting floss; direct seeding will delay the season, and intercropping will affect cotton growth. Raising seedlings and transplanting ensures early sowing and cultivates strong seedlings. Second, transplanting rapeseed can promote the development of fibrous roots and enhance cold resistance and fertilizer absorption. Third, it is easy to manage during the seedling stage, which can ensure that the seedlings are complete, strong, and even.

    (3) Reasonable Close Planting to Improve Land Utilization Rate
    This year, the density of rapeseed planting has generally increased from about 8,000 plants last year to about 20,000 plants. The average row spacing is 6×4 cun, and the ditch width is one chi and five cun.

    After implementing large-scale reasonable close planting, the increase in production is significant. From the two-year comparison of the Wudongzha Commune, this year, under the conditions of lower fertilization level than last year and the same varieties, due to the increase in density from 7,000 to 8,000 plants last year to 15,000 to 18,000 plants, the average yield per mu increased from 108 jin last year to 135 jin. Under the conditions of abundant fertilizer and water, the effect of increased production after close planting is more significant. The 1.49 mu of Shengli rapeseed in the Dong'an Brigade experimental field was applied with 396 dan of standard fertilizer per mu, with an average density of 18,000 plants, and the yield per mu reached 362 jin; compared with the previous sparse planting of 3,000 plants, the yield was 80 jin per mu, an increase of 3.5 times.

    (4) Rational Fertilization to Ensure Rapeseed is Well-Fed
    In 1958, due to the large-scale late-stage cultivation of cotton, the fertility of the previous crop was not fully absorbed, which prepared fertile soil for the subsequent rapeseed crop. This year, rapeseed was applied with an average of 60 dan of standard fertilizer per mu.

    In terms of fertilization methods, we have mastered the principle of applying sufficient base fertilizer, applying appropriate seedling fertilizer, applying quick-acting winter-spring fertilizer, and applying heavy bud-flower fertilizer, applying in four stages. Applying sufficient base fertilizer can make the rapeseed seedlings develop vigorously in the seedling stage and enhance stress resistance, which is a prerequisite for high yield. Seedling fertilizer should be applied appropriately. Last winter, the weather was dry, and all-out efforts were made to fight drought and irrigate, which had a great effect on promoting seedling growth. However, when applying the second topdressing of seedling fertilizer after drought resistance, it is necessary to master the principle of applying fertilizer as soon as yellowing is seen, and combining plant application with general application. Winter-spring fertilizer is a topdressing to ensure the safe overwintering of rapeseed. As the saying goes, "If rapeseed is covered with ash once before winter, it is like covering it with cotton for three winters." Generally, river mud, grass ash, and livestock manure have been applied to rapeseed throughout the county. The bud-flower period is the stage when rapeseed needs the most fertilizer throughout its entire growth period. This year, after the large-scale expansion of rapeseed planting throughout the county, the early base fertilizer and topdressing were insufficient. Therefore, a heavy fertilizer was generally applied during the bud-flower period, which played a decisive role in promoting rapeseed branching and pod formation.

    (5) Strengthen Field Management
    After implementing deep plowing, close planting, and increasing fertilizer application, field management work needs to be more meticulous. According to the survey, this year, each mu of rapeseed generally requires 27 workdays, an increase of 25% compared to 1958. This year, field management basically achieved three diligences (diligently weeding and cultivating soil, diligently preventing diseases and pests, and diligently applying fertilizer to promote seedling growth), and timely moss removal (removing moss in batches and by plant, determining the amount of moss removal based on growth and fertility, applying fertilizer while removing moss to promote rapid branching of rapeseed). According to a survey by Tianyang Brigade, Shengli rapeseed that was not mossed had a plant height of 107 cm, 6 branches per plant, 328 pods per plant, and a pod formation rate of 38.4%; the plant height of mossed rapeseed was 136 cm, 8.9 branches per plant, 2.9 more than the un-mossed plants, 581 pods, 253 more than the un-mossed plants, and a pod formation rate of 54.5%. This proves that moss removal is an effective measure to promote more branching, more pods, and higher yields.

    Field management work mainly focuses on the following key points: Vigorously grasp drought resistance during the seedling stage. Two months after sowing last year, it did not rain, and the rapeseed seedlings turned red and yellow. After comprehensive drought resistance, the growth quickly improved. Vigorously grasp frost prevention and warmth before freezing to achieve "prevention when cold comes, and no worries when cold goes." After rapeseed was sown last year, it encountered three cold waves, and the lowest temperature reached minus seven degrees Celsius. We used various frost prevention methods such as covering grass and heaping ash, and smoking at midnight to prevent frost damage. Sclerotinia and viral diseases are major enemies of rapeseed production increase. In 1958, the incidence of Sclerotinia in Shengli rapeseed throughout the county reached more than 50%, with a yield loss of 10%-15%, and the incidence of Sclerotinia in local rapeseed reached more than 70%, with severe cases even resulting in no harvest. This year, a combination of chemical and manual control methods was used to reduce the incidence of Sclerotinia in rapeseed to 6%-7%.

    Several Issues in Striving for High Yield
    1. Regarding the issue of promoting improved varieties. Comparative trials in recent years have proven that Shengli rapeseed is suitable for close planting, fertilizer-resistant, cold-resistant, and high-yielding, but its growth period is about 10 days longer than that of local rapeseed. In 1958, in order to prevent the cotton planting from being affected, the cotton-growing areas generally adopted local rapeseed varieties, accounting for more than 50% of the total area. However, the yield of local rapeseed varieties is unstable. Under the same cultivation conditions, the 5th team of Andong Brigade's 111 mu of local rapeseed yielded 160 jin per mu, while 94 mu of Shengli rapeseed yielded 250 jin per mu, a difference of nearly 60%. This year, the Jiatang Brigade of Simen Township all adopted Shengli rapeseed, which yielded 50 to 100 jin more per mu than the surrounding local varieties. Therefore, to strive for high yields, it is necessary to universally promote Shengli rapeseed.

    2. How is close planting considered reasonable? This is an important issue in striving for a greater rapeseed harvest. From the practical results this year, close planting is closely related to varieties, fertilization, deep plowing, and a series of production increase measures such as field management and moss removal. If the degree of close planting is blindly increased without considering various specific conditions, the goal of increasing production cannot be achieved. According to the preliminary summary of various places, it is most appropriate to plant 18,000 to 20,000 plants per mu based on local specific conditions.

    3. Regarding the issue of fertilization. Fertilization must be rational. This year, many experimental fields experienced lodging due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer in the later stage; some did not turn green in the later stage, and the pods were not strong. However, judging from the large-scale fertilization situation, fertilizer is still insufficient, especially base fertilizer. More than 40,000 mu of rapeseed land in the county has not been applied with base fertilizer. This situation of emphasizing topdressing, neglecting base fertilizer, applying more topdressing, and applying less base fertilizer can easily cause lodging and affect production increase.

    4. Regarding the issue of balanced high yield. There is a large imbalance in the yield of various places throughout the county. The highest yield per mu reached 612 jin, while the lowest yield per mu was less than 100 jin. This fully shows that under the same natural conditions, there are still many loopholes in the cultivation process that affect production increase. For example, some areas do not have enough base fertilizer, and seedlings cannot emerge early; some moss removal is too late, and a few have not been removed; the excellent variety of Shengli rapeseed has not been adopted on a large scale; and the work of preventing and controlling pests and diseases has not been done well in some areas. This shows that as long as the measures are closely linked and the loopholes are blocked, the potential for rapeseed production increase is endless.

    Winter Planting Plan This Year
    In response to the experiences and lessons learned from this year's rapeseed production, the technical measures for this winter's rapeseed sowing work require grasping the following aspects:

    1. Comprehensively promote excellent varieties, implement early sowing and early planting, pass the key to strong seedlings and early emergence, and further solve the contradiction between double cropping. According to this year's experience, it is necessary to adopt the excellent variety of Shengli rapeseed, seize the time for early sowing, and ensure that cotton production is not affected. The only measure is to adopt seedling raising and transplanting. However, seedling raising and transplanting require a large amount of labor, and some areas are limited by labor conditions. Therefore, in addition to rationally arranging labor and actively promoting seedling raising and transplanting, a part of medium-maturing Xinghua rapeseed and early-maturing local rapeseed can also be appropriately matched.

    2. Based on the characteristics of the developed root system of rapeseed, the existing 6-7 cun of cultivated layer is obviously not enough to meet the growth requirements of rapeseed. Therefore, this winter, it is necessary to continue to deepen the cultivated layer to more than 8 cun on the basis of the original deep plowing, and to deep plow more than 1 chi in 20% of the high-yielding land.

    3. Implement rational close planting, with the degree of close planting centered on promoting 18,000 to 20,000 plants, and the coastal saline-alkali land and lean land can be appropriately increased to fully exploit the potential of the land and achieve the purpose of increasing production through close planting.

    4. Increase fertilizer application and use fertilizer rationally. Vigorously carry out winter manure accumulation, prepare sufficient base fertilizer for winter crops, and ensure that 80 dan of standard fertilizer is applied per mu of rapeseed.

    总结高产经验再争更大高产
　　浙江慈溪县农业局
    慈溪县是一个棉花、春花两熟制地区。过去，这里油菜种植面积只占春花总面积的2％多。
    今年党委大抓油料生产，全县油菜面积从1958年的一万八千亩扩大到十五万多亩。油菜成了春花生产的主要作物。
    大半年来，全县农民在党的领导下，抓住了栽培过程中的主要关键，战胜了旱冻病虫等自然灾害，终于获得了大面积丰收，平均亩产量达到一百五十一斤，其中三万四千多亩平均亩产达二百二十九斤多。
    主要技术措施
    （一）实行深耕　精细整地
    农谚说：“冬耕加一寸，顶过一遍粪”。油菜是支根很发达的作物，土层深厚疏松，根系就能得到良好发育。往年，耕地深度只有三、四寸，今年全部油菜地深耕达六至八寸。在播种移植前又普遍进行了一次精细整地。事实证明，深耕是油菜增产的一项好办法。全县亩产二百斤以上的油菜地，深耕都在一尺以上；亩产六百一十二斤的高额丰产地，深耕达一尺八寸。庵东大队五小队二百亩油菜，深耕六到八寸，平均亩产二百零九斤，其中十亩深耕一尺二寸，亩产四百零八斤；丰产试验地深耕一尺八寸，亩产量高达四百八十八斤。但深耕要注意不乱土层，结合增施基肥。
    （二）育苗移栽　早播早栽
    早播好处多，当地群众说：“若要油，寒露之前就动手。”早播早栽，这是丰产的一条经验。去年9月25日全县油菜开始育苗，10月8日旺播，10月15日结束，比往年提早十到十五天。今年育苗移栽的面积达59.33％。各地总结育苗移栽有三大好处：第一，可以解决棉花、油菜前后作的矛盾。因为油菜播种期，正是棉花吐絮期；直播会延误季节，套种会影响棉花生长。育苗移栽既保证了早播，又培育好壮苗。第二，移栽油菜能促使须根发达，增强抗寒吸肥能力。第三，苗床期中便于管理，能保证苗全、苗壮、苗匀。
    （三）合理密植　提高土地利用率
    今年油菜密植程度从去年八千株左右普遍提高到二万株左右。平均行株距为6×4寸，沟阔一尺五寸。
    实行大面积合理密植后，增产是显著的。从五洞闸公社两年对比情况来看，今年在施肥水平比去年低、品种相同的情况下，由于密度从去年的七、八千株，提高到一万五千到一万八千株，平均亩产量从去年的一百零八斤提高到一百三十五斤。在肥多、水足的条件下，密植后增产效果更显著。东安大队试验场一点四九亩胜利油菜，亩施标准肥三百九十六担，平均密度一万八千株，亩产达三百六十二斤；比往年稀植三千株亩产八十斤，增产三点五倍。
    （四）合理施肥保证油菜吃饱吃好
    1958年由于大搞棉花后期培育，前作肥力未全部吸收，为后作油菜准备了肥沃的土壤。今年油菜每亩平均施标准肥六十担。
    在施肥方法上，掌握施足基肥，适施苗肥，速施腊春肥，重施蕾花肥，分四期施入。施足基肥，能使油菜苗期发育旺盛，增强抗逆能力，是丰产的先决条件。苗肥要施得适当。去年冬季，天气干旱，全力抗旱浇水，对促进幼苗生长作用很大。但在抗旱后第二次追苗肥时，要掌握见黄即施，株施与普施相结合。腊春肥是保证油菜安全越冬的一次追肥。农谚说：“油菜冬前壅次灰，好比三冬盖棉被。”全县油菜一般都施了河泥、草灰、畜栏肥等。蕾花期是油菜整个生长期需肥最多的阶段。今年全县大面积扩种油菜后，前期基肥、追肥不足，因此，在蕾花期普遍追施了一次重肥，对促进油菜分枝结荚起了决定性的作用。
    （五）加强田间管理
    实行深耕、密植、增施肥料以后，田间管理工作需要更加细致。据调查，今年每亩油菜一般花工二十七工，比1958年增加25％。今年田间管理基本上做到三勤（勤削地培土、勤防病治虫、勤施肥提苗），及时打苔（分批分株打，看生长、看肥力决定打苔多少，边打苔边施肥，促使油菜迅速分枝）。据田央大队调查，未打苔的胜利油菜株高一百零七公分，每株六个分枝，每株结荚三百二十八个，成荚率38.4％；打苔的株高一百三十六公分，每株八点九个分枝，比未打的多二点九个，结荚五百八十一个，比未打的多二百五十三个，成荚率达54.5％。这证明打苔是促使分枝多、结荚多、产量高的有效措施。
    田间管理工作，主要是抓住以下几个关键：苗期大抓抗旱，去年播种后两个月未下雨，菜苗发红发黄，经全面抗旱后，生长迅速好转。冰冻前大抓防冻保暖，做到“寒来有御，寒去无患”。去年油菜播种后遇三次寒潮侵袭，最低温度达到摄氏零下七度。我们采用盖草壅灰、半夜熏烟等多种防冻办法，防住了冻害。菌核病、毒素病是油菜增产的大敌，1958年全县胜利油菜菌核病发病率达50％以上，产量损失10％—15％，本地油菜菌核病达70％以上，严重的甚至颗粒无收。今年采用药剂与人工防治相结合的办法，将油菜菌核病发病率压低到6％—7％。
    争取高产的几个问题
    一、关于推广良种问题。几年来对比试验证明，胜利油菜既适宜密植，又耐肥、耐寒、高产，但生长期比本地种油菜长十天左右。1958年，棉区为了不使棉花播种受影响，普遍采用本地种油菜，占总面积的50％以上。但是本地种油菜产量不稳定，在同样培育条件下，庵东大队五小队一百一十一亩本地油菜亩产一百六十斤，而九十四亩胜利油菜亩产达二百五十斤，相差近60％。泗门夹塘大队今年全部采用胜利油菜，每亩比周围的本地种高出五十斤到一百斤。因此要争取高产，必须普遍推广胜利种。
    二、密植怎样才算合理？这是争取油菜更大丰收的一个重要问题。从今年的实践结果来看，密植与品种、施肥、深耕以及田间管理、打苔等一系列增产措施有着密切关系。如果不根据各种具体条件，盲目提高密植程度，结果也不能达到增产的目的。据各地初步总结，根据本地具体条件，每亩栽种一万八千到二万株最适宜。
    三、关于施肥问题。施肥必须合理，今年不少试验田，因后期氮肥过多，发生倒伏现象；有的后期不退青，结荚反而不壮实。但从大面积施肥情况来看，肥还是不足的，特别是基肥不足，全县有四万多亩油菜地没有施过基肥。这种重追肥、轻基肥、追肥多、基肥少的情况，容易造成倒伏，影响增产。
    四、关于均衡高产问题。全县各地的产量存在着很大不平衡，最高亩产达六百一十二斤，低的亩产还不到一百斤。这充分说明在同样自然条件下，由于在栽培过程中还存在着不少漏洞，影响增产。例如部分地区基肥不足，苗不能早发；有的打苔太迟，少数没有打；胜利油菜优良品种还没有大面积采用；部分地区防治病虫害工作做得不够。这说明只要在措施上环环扣紧，堵住漏洞，油菜增产的潜力无穷。
    今年冬种打算
    针对今年油菜生产上的经验教训，对今冬油菜播种工作，在技术措施上要求抓住以下几方面：
    一、全面推广优良品种，实行早播早栽，过好壮苗早发关，进一步解决两熟矛盾。根据今年经验，既要采用胜利油菜优良品种，抢时间早播，又要保证棉花生产不受影响，唯一的措施就是采用育苗移栽。但是育苗移栽花工较大，部分地区受到劳力条件的限制，因此除了合理安排劳力，积极推广育苗移栽外，还可适当搭配一部分中熟兴化油菜和早熟土种油菜。
    二、根据油菜根系发达的特性，现有六、七寸的耕作层显然还不能适应油菜的生育要求。因此，今冬要继续在原有深耕的基础上，大面积加深到八寸以上，20％丰产地深耕一尺以上。
    三、实行合理密植，密植程度以推广一万八千到二万株为中心，沿海咸碱地及瘦地可以适当增加，以充分发挥土地潜力，达到密植增产的目的。
    四、增施肥料，合理用肥。大力开展冬季积肥，备足冬作基肥，保证每亩油菜施八十担标准肥。
