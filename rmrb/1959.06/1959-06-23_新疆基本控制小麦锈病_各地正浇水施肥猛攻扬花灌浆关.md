    Xinjiang Basically Controls Wheat Rust
    Various Regions are Watering and Fertilizing, Vigorously Attacking the Heading and Grain-Filling Stage
    Our newspaper Urumqi dispatch on June 22nd: Farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have achieved a decisive victory in preventing and controlling wheat rust, and are now focusing on watering and fertilizing to vigorously attack the heading and grain-filling stage of wheat.
    This year, the entire region planted more than 13.7 million mu of wheat, exceeding the original plan by 24.6%, and the general growth is good. In the past month or so, wheat rust and drought have occurred in many areas. People's communes universally organized forces to prevent and control the disease in a timely manner, and basically controlled the development of wheat rust. In Kashgar Prefecture, where wheat rust was more serious, the entire Party and all the people took action, dividing areas of responsibility to ensure the prevention work proceeded quickly and well. Leading comrades of the Party and government in Kuqa County, on the banks of the Weigan River, divided up the battle zones, mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and ideas, and found nearly 40 methods for preventing and controlling wheat rust, which were immediately taught and promoted, forming a mass movement for rust prevention. More than 310,000 mu of wheat in the county were able to successfully head and fill grain.
    While preventing and controlling wheat rust, all regions also organized manpower to water and fertilize the wheat that is heading and filling grain, to promote full and heavy grains. Farmers in the suburbs of Kashgar City in southern Xinjiang have applied heading and grain-filling fertilizer to 57,000 mu of wheat, with an average application rate of more than 9,000 jin. The vast majority of wheat fields have begun their fourth watering.
    While making every effort to do a good job in field management before wheat ripening, all parts of Xinjiang, based on the large sown area of wheat this year and the good and dense growth, have generally begun preparations for wheat harvesting in advance to ensure a bumper harvest. (Ding Wen)

    新疆基本控制小麦锈病
    各地正浇水施肥猛攻扬花灌浆关
    本报乌鲁木齐22日电　新疆各族农民在防治小麦锈病中取得了决定性的胜利，现在又以水肥并举，猛攻小麦扬花灌浆关。
    今年全疆种植小麦一千三百七十多万亩，超过原订计划的24.6％，一般生长良好。近一个多月来，许多地区的小麦发生了锈病和旱象。各人民公社普遍组织力量，及时防治，基本上控制了锈病的发展。锈病比较严重的喀什专区，全党全民动手，分片包干，使防锈工作进行的又快又好。渭干河畔库车县的党政负责同志都划分战区，发动群众献策献计，找出近四十种防治锈病的办法，并立即传授推广，形成了群众性的防锈运动，全县三十一万多亩小麦都能顺利的扬花灌浆。
    各地在防治锈病的同时，又组织了人力为正在扬花、灌浆的小麦浇水、施肥，促使小麦粒饱、粒重。南疆喀什市郊区的农民，为五万七千亩小麦，分别追了扬花灌浆肥，施肥量平均达九千斤以上，绝大部分麦田已开始浇第四次水。
    新疆各地在全力作好麦熟前田间管理工作的同时，又根据今年小麦播种面积大、长的好长的密的情况，普遍提前进行了麦收准备工作，保证作到丰产丰收。（丁文）
