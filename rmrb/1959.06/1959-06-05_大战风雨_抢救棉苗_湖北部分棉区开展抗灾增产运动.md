    新华社武汉3日电　湖北省部分棉区农民，同狂风暴雨和寒潮所作的斗争，已经获得很大成绩。
    湖北省今年棉花播种面积共八百多万亩，一般都生长良好。5月下旬，部分地区突然遭到了狂风暴雨和寒潮的袭击，幼嫩的棉苗受到了损伤。灾情发生以后，各地立即组织大批干部、老农和技术人员，对棉田逐块检查，并发动群众总结去年抗灾保苗、抗灾增产的经验，鼓舞了广大群众战胜这次灾害的信心和干劲，迅速掀起了一个抢时间、保全苗、加措施、超计划的抗灾增产运动。地处江汉平原的荆州专区，参加抗灾斗争的达六十多万人。受灾比较严重的监利县，出动了十二万人，一天一夜从渍水中抢救了六万多亩棉苗。江陵县弥市公社党委书记杨厚德，在八级大风中，领导群众用门板、芦席在二千八百多亩棉田旁边搭了防风牌，保住了棉苗未受损失。石首县大垸公社自由生产队党支部书记杨梅芳，冒大风大雨，打开棉田的闸门排水，从渍水中抢救了一千八百多亩棉田。
