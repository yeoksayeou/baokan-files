Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th - Since the democratic reform, the cultural and educational undertakings in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, have flourished. Now, the prefecture has 436 primary schools, basically universalizing primary education; secondary schools have also developed to seven, with more than 40,000 middle and primary school students. Tibetan students account for more than 80% of Tibetan school-age children. The number of primary schools established in the prefecture last year increased by 21% compared with 1957 before the reform. Taojiang County (a purely pastoral area), which had no schools in the past, established 26 primary schools within a year, giving 2,987 children of poor herders the opportunity to study. When the first primary school was born on the Sangke Grassland, the herders wore new clothes and presented hadas to the teachers sent by the county. Zhuoma Cairang, who had been a slave for half her life, sent both of her children to school. She said: "We used to be oppressed like cattle and horses, but now we have turned over, and we can no longer let our children suffer the pain of being uneducated like us."

Before liberation, only two counties in the agricultural area of Gannan had middle and primary schools, and very few Tibetan youths had the opportunity to study; in the vast pastoral area, the education undertaking was almost a blank slate. After liberation, the educational work in the agricultural area of Gannan developed rapidly, but in the pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the reactionary feudal upper class at that time did not allow the people to run schools and prevented the party's policies and cultural science from meeting the masses. For example, the five tent schools established by the people's government in the pastoral area in 1957 were all undermined by feudal headmen. After last year's democratic reform and the establishment of people's communes, poor people in various places have asked the people's government to send teachers to run schools. The Autonomous Prefecture People's Government has also allocated a large amount of funds for the construction of school buildings and the purchase of teaching aids for primary and secondary schools in various places. At the same time, the cultural life of all ethnic groups has also become active. Now, various cultural institutions have been established from the grassland to the forest area. The Autonomous Prefecture has established a Qinqiang Opera Troupe and the Gannan Song and Dance Troupe composed of Tibetan actors. De Wu Lu City has established a cinema, and each county has a film team, cultural center, broadcasting station, and Xinhua Bookstore. Some communes and production teams have also established clubs, libraries, cultural stations, and amateur theater troupes and song and dance teams.

    民主改革后促进教育事业大发展
    甘南基本普及小学教育
    新华社兰州11日电　甘肃省甘南藏族自治州民主改革以后，文化教育事业蓬勃发展。现在，全州已有小学四百三十六所，基本上普及了小学教育；中等学校也发展到七所，中、小学生已达四万多人。藏族学生已占藏族学龄儿童80％以上。去年全州办起的小学，比改革前的1957年增加21％。过去没有一所学校的洮江县（纯牧区），一年之内办起了二十六所小学，使二千九百八十七名贫苦牧民子弟得到了读书机会。当桑科草原上第一所小学诞生时，牧民们穿着新衣服，把哈达献给县上派来的教师。当了半辈子奴隶的卓玛才壤，把自己两个孩子都送进学校。她说：“我们从前像牛马一样被人欺压，如今翻身了，再不能让孩子跟我们受没有文化的苦。”
    解放前，甘南只有农业区的两个县办了中、小学，藏族青年读书的极少；广大牧业区，教育事业几乎是一个空白点。解放后，甘南农业区的教育工作发展很快，而在牧业区和半农半牧区，当时反动的封建上层分子不准人民办学校，不让党的政策和文化科学与群众见面。例如1957年人民政府在牧业区办的五所帐篷小学，都被封建头人搞垮了。经过去年的民主改革和建立人民公社以后，各地贫苦群众纷纷要求人民政府派教师去兴办学校。自治州人民政府也拨出大批款项，供各地中小学校建设校舍和购置教具之用。同时，各族人民的文化生活也活跃起来。现在，从草原到林区，已建立了各项文化机构。自治州成立了秦腔剧团，和由藏族演员组成的甘南歌舞团。德乌鲁市建立了电影院，各县都有电影队、文化馆、广播站和新华书店。有些公社和生产队，也建立了俱乐部、图书馆、文化站和业余剧团、歌舞队等。
