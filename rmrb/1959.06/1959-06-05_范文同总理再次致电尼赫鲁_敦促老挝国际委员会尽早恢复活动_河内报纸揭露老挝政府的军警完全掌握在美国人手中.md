Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 4th: Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent another telegram to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on June 2nd regarding the Laotian situation. The telegram stated that the situation in Laos has deteriorated daily since May 11th. The Lao Royal Army, under the orders of the Phoui Sananikone government, has launched a large-scale offensive against the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces. Fierce fighting has taken place in the Xieng Khouang region, near the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In particular, the fighting on May 28th and 29th was extremely intense, and the flames of war have not yet subsided.

The telegram pointed out that there is no doubt that the Phoui Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the serious situation they have created under foreign instigation.

The telegram stated that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that in order to contain and extinguish as soon as possible the flames of war that are burning and threatening the peace of Indochina, the International Commission for Laos must resume its activities as soon as possible to ensure strict adherence to the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

In the last part of the telegram, Pham Van Dong asked Nehru to make a quick decision on the above-mentioned dangerous situation. He pointed out that otherwise, the situation would develop more and more seriously.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 3rd: "Capital Hanoi Newspaper" pointed out today that an article written by Haines Miller, an official of the U.S. International Cooperation Administration stationed in Laos, revealing the U.S. military plan in Laos, is clear evidence of U.S. interference in Laos' internal affairs.

The article, entitled "U.S. Aid to Laos," said that Washington decided three and a half years ago to make the Kingdom of Laos a springboard for opposing communism in Southeast Asia. Since then, the United States has given Laos more than 135 million U.S. dollars, of which six-fifths was used to supply an armed force of 30,000 people, including the police. The article emphasized that the Lao army is "the only national army entirely funded by American taxpayers" other than the U.S. own army. It also said that everything about this army is completely planned by about thirty representatives of the Pentagon.

The article further revealed that the United States had intended to develop the Lao police force, which had only a few hundred people, into a well-equipped force of 4,000 people "organized and commanded by a group of American police experts."

"Capital Hanoi Newspaper" pointed out that this clearly proves that the U.S. interference in Laos is very serious. From the Lao regular army to the police force, military affairs are completely controlled by American interventionists. This also proves that the Phoui Sananikone government's claim that "the United States has not interfered in Laos" is a complete lie.

    范文同总理再次致电尼赫鲁
    敦促老挝国际委员会尽早恢复活动
    河内报纸揭露老挝政府的军警完全掌握在美国人手中
    新华社河内4日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同2日就老挝局势再次打电报给印度总理尼赫鲁。电报说，从5月11日到现在，老挝局势日益恶化。老挝王国军队奉培·萨纳尼空政府的命令，向前寮国战斗部队展开了大规模的进攻。激烈的战斗已经在川圹的靠近越南民主共和国边界的地区进行。尤其是5月28日和29日，双方的战斗极为激烈，直到现在，战火还未停息。
    电报指出，毫无疑问，培·萨纳尼空政府必须对它们在外国的唆使下所制造的严重局势负全部责任。
    电报说，越南民主共和国政府认为，为了遏制和早日扑灭正在燃烧并威胁到印度支那的和平的战火，老挝国际委员会必须尽早恢复活动，以保证严格履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    范文同在电报最后要求尼赫鲁对上述的危险局势迅速作出决定。他指出，否则局势将发展得愈来愈严重。
    新华社河内3日电　“首都河内报”今天指出，美国国际合作署驻在老挝的一个官员海因斯·米勒写的一篇文章所透露的美国在老挝的军事计划，是美国干涉老挝内政的明证。
    这篇题为“美国对老挝的援助”的文章说，华盛顿在三年半以前就决定把老挝王国作为在东南亚反对共产主义的跳板。从那时以来，美国给了老挝一亿三千五百万美元以上，其中六分之五用于供给一支包括警察在内的三万人的武装部队。文章着重指出，老挝军队是除美国自己的军队以外“完全由美国纳税人供给经费的唯一的国家军队”。它还说，这支军队的一切是完全由五角大楼的大约三十个代表进行谋划的。
    文章进一步透露说，美国曾经打算使只有几百人的老挝警察部队发展成为一支“由一批美国警察专家组织和指挥的”四千人的装备精良的部队。
      “首都河内报”指出，这就清楚地证明了美国干涉老挝的情况是很严重的，从老挝的正规军到警察部队，军务完全掌握在美国干涉者的手中。这也证明，培·萨纳尼空政府所谓“美国没有干涉老挝”的说法是彻头彻尾的谎言。
