Ambition Exceeds Erlang Mountain
On the Kangzang Plateau, mountains are linked to mountains, covered with snow all year round, the climate is cold, the air is thin, and there are few people. The roads are narrow, the slopes are steep, and fog pervades. Postal workers work joyfully, driving day and night on the plateau. No matter how high the mountains or how difficult the roads, their ambition overcomes Erlang Mountain. Leap Forward songs rise everywhere, and Party newspapers and letters are quickly delivered.

This poem was written last year during the Great Leap Forward to praise the automobile drivers on the Chengdu-Kangding postal transportation line. This line is responsible for delivering newspapers and mail from Chengdu to the 53 counties under the jurisdiction of the three special districts and two autonomous prefectures of Wenjiang, Ya'an, Xichang, Ganzi, and Liangshan. The postal route is 380 kilometers long and passes through three dangerous ferries and a mountain 3,800 meters above sea level – Erlang Mountain.

In March of last year, when spring was blooming in the interior, Erlang Mountain had not yet shed its silvery winter coat. Whether it was the towering peaks or the winding mountain roads, they were still covered with snow and ice. Beside the road were bottomless cliffs, and the mountain was filled with thick fog. Sometimes, when driving in the mountains, cars had to turn on their lights even during the day; at night, it goes without saying. In the days of the Great Leap Forward, in order to quickly bring Party newspapers and letters to the other side of the mountain, postal workers worked day and night, overcoming dangers, and created the miracle of crossing Erlang Mountain at night.

When the first car, traveling day and night and loaded with newspapers and mail, crossed Erlang Mountain, it was already late at night. It was dark, the roads were slippery, and cold wind mixed with drizzle came from all directions. Looking out of the car window, the driver saw only a vast expanse, unable to distinguish east from west. Although anti-skid chains had been added to the wheels, it still felt like it was making very slow progress. The escort sitting next to the driver said worriedly, "Driving like this is like a woman with bound feet, how long will it take to get over the mountain?" The driver also said a little anxiously, "If it were up to me, I'd just charge through!" But he couldn't really charge through because there was no target. The escort suddenly thought of using a flashlight to signal and lead the way in front of the car. The driver agreed. And so they drove forward.

"Boom!"... Stones collapsed from the top of the mountain, blocking the car's path, and the car stopped. The driver took out the prepared crowbar and pickaxe and handed one to his partner. The two of them started digging. When the road was cleared, they continued on their way.

In this way, they finally conquered Erlang Mountain before dawn, safely delivering the Party newspaper and mail to Kangding, the capital of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, creating a miracle that predecessors had never dreamed of. From then on, people on the plateau saw the provincial newspaper one or two days earlier.

As the situation continued to develop, by the autumn of last year, more than 70 counties in Sichuan Province were able to see the provincial newspaper on the same day. However, even with round-the-clock service on the Chengdu-Kangding postal route and cars crossing Erlang Mountain at night, the needs of the people could not be met. Some people said, "We look forward to the newspaper like we look forward to the stars and the moon!" "The newspaper is a treasure, full of experience. It's really worrying not to see it on the same day!" The postal workers felt very uncomfortable when they heard these words.

Where was the problem?

After extensive airing of views, debates, and discussions, everyone analyzed the situation. Some people did detailed accounting and believed that the journey from Chengdu to Kangding involved 22 mail exchange points, and no less than a hundred postal workers were working on this line. If the links between these exchange points and the work of these hundreds of people were tightened, there was great potential to be tapped. After discussion, everyone agreed that cooperation should be improved, operating techniques should be improved, and shipments should be made earlier, so that postal vehicles could cross Erlang Mountain during the day, not only improving the speed of newspaper delivery but also solving the difficulties of nighttime driving.

From then on, the newspaper sealing and dispatching personnel of the Chengdu Bureau not only implemented planned sealing and dispatching internally, but also signed a cooperation contract with the newspaper to bring forward the publication time. The porters and escorts also actively helped to bundle newspapers and load mailbags. From the starting point to the end point, all the postal workers along the way joined the battle. As soon as they heard the car coming, whether they were sealing and dispatching personnel, business personnel, village postmen, deliverymen, or even the director, or even the cooks, everyone worked together, and in a dozen minutes, the loading, unloading, and handover of mail and newspapers was done clearly. Sure enough, the total postal transportation time was shortened from the original 19 hours to 13 hours. In broad daylight, the car drove up Erlang Mountain. At 7 o'clock in the afternoon, it arrived in Kangding. Every evening, the provincial newspaper of the day met with the majority of readers on the plateau; 91% of the people's communes, factories, and mines in the 12 counties along the route could see the provincial newspaper within two days.

### 雄心超过二郎山

    雄心超过二郎山
    康藏高原山连山，终年积雪气候寒，空气稀薄人烟少，路窄坡陡雾弥漫。邮电职工干的欢，昼夜行车在高原，哪怕山高路艰险，雄心压倒二郎山，跃进歌声四处起，党报信件迅速传。
    这首诗是去年大跃进中，人们写来赞扬成都——康定邮政运输线上的汽车驾驶员的。这条线，担负着从成都到温江、雅安、西昌、甘孜、凉山等三个专区、两个自治州所属五十三个县的报纸、邮件传递工作。邮路全长三百八十公里，中途要经过三个险要渡口，和一座拔海三千八百公尺的大山——二郎山。
    去年3月，正当内地春暖花开的时节，二郎山还没有卸下她那银色的冬装，不管是高耸入云的山峰或是曲折盘旋的山路，都还铺着白雪，结着坚冰。道旁是深不见底的悬崖，山中弥漫着浓厚的雾气。有时，汽车在山中行驶，白天也要开灯；黑夜，就更不用说了。在大跃进的日子里，邮电职工为了把党报和信很快地带到山那边去，他们不分昼夜，不避艰险地，创造了夜过二郎山的奇迹。
    当第一部昼夜兼程的汽车满载着报纸、邮件翻越二郎山时，已经是深夜了。天黑、路滑，寒风夹着细雨，从四面八方袭来。驾驶员从汽车的风窗里望出去，只见一片茫茫，不辨东西。车轮上虽然也加了防滑的链条，然而还是感到寸步难行。坐在司机台旁边的押运员忧虑地说：“这样行车，真成了小脚女人，要多久才翻得过山呢？”驾驶员也有点急燥地说：“依得我，干脆给它冲过去！”但是，他也没办法真的冲过去。因为缺少一个目标。押运员忽然想起了用手电筒在车前边打手势带路的办法。驾驶员同意了。就这样驾驶着汽车前进了。
    “轰??……！”山顶上的石头塌下来了，阻塞了车子的去路，汽车停了下来。驾驶员把准备好的十字锹、洋镐拿出来，递了一把给他的伙伴，两个人便动手挖起来。道路铲平了，他们又继续前行。
    他们就这样终于在黎明前战胜了二郎山，把党报和邮件安全地运到甘孜藏族自治州的首府康定，创造了前人梦想不到的奇迹。从此，高原上的人们提早了一两天看到省报。
    形势不断发展，去年秋季，四川省已经有七十多个县能够看到当天的省报了。而成康邮路，虽然实行了昼夜兼程，汽车夜越二郎山，仍然满足不了人民群众的需要。有人说，“盼报纸像盼星星、盼月亮一样！”“报纸是个宝，经验装满了，当天看不到，实在好心焦！”这些话，邮电职工听到了，心里非常难受。
    问题究竟在哪里呢？
    经过大鸣大放大辩论，大家分析了这个情况，有人算了细账：认为成都到康定，要经过二十二个邮件交换点，在这条线上工作的邮电职工，不下百余人。如果这些交换点和百多个人交换工作之间，环节扣紧了，就大有潜力可挖。经过讨论，大家一致认为应当搞好协作，改进操作技术，提早发运，让邮车白天过二郎山，不但提高报纸邮运速度，也解决夜行车的困难。
    从此，成都局的报纸封发员不但在内部实行了计划封发，而且还和报社签订了协作合同，提早了出报时间。搬运员、押运员也主动帮助捆报纸、装邮袋。从起点到终点，沿途的邮电职工都投入了战斗。他们一听到车子来了，不管是封发员、营业员、乡邮员、投递员，还是局长，甚至炊事员，大家一齐动手，十几分钟就把邮件、报纸的装卸交接工作，弄得清清楚楚。果然，全线邮运时间由原来的十九个钟头，缩短为十三个钟头。大白天，汽车就开上了二郎山。午后7点钟到达康定。每天傍晚，当天的省报就在高原上和广大读者见了面；沿途十二个县有91％的人民公社、工厂、矿山，能在两天内看到省报。
