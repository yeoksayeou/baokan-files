Title: Welcome Rain on the Plateau

Living for the first time on the Qinghai Plateau, 3,000 meters above sea level, I learned that the spring rain arrives as late as midsummer. In the lovely capital I just left, the willows and peaches are probably already green and red, and one would be sweating even in a shirt, right? In my long-separated hometown in the south of the Yangtze River, the continuous rainy season of the plum rains is probably over, and the wheat has already been harvested, right? But here on the frontier of the motherland, on the western Qinghai Plateau, I was fortunate enough to enjoy the wonderful sight of "rain at the foot of the mountain, snow on the top" in the red May. Rushing out of the room, the cold wind whistled, and facing the misty rain, I was mesmerized by the magnificent picture painted by nature. Through the light gauze curtain woven by the rain, looking up at the surrounding mountains, all turned white overnight. The originally tall and majestic mountains had gained a bit of charm. A few verdant cypresses, standing tall on the peaks, had become green trees with silver flowers. And in the plains surrounded by mountains and undulating hills, patches of lush green wheat seedlings grew, revealing the spring colors of the plateau!

The raindrops flowed from my cheeks to the corners of my mouth, and I excitedly and greedily sucked on these cool water droplets, feeling that they were as fragrant and sweet as nectar! Suddenly, the sentences from "Record of the Joyful Rain Pavilion" that I read as a child, "The pavilion is named after rain to record the joy," flooded into my mind. For decades, I have disliked the drizzling rain, but today, I am soaked in the rain with joy. The mood of dozens of comrades in the farm is the same as mine. In mid-April, we were once filled with joy, welcoming the rushing and surging snow water that melted from the high mountains after the spring thaw. In order to allow this unruly water flow to obediently pass through large and small canals to irrigate the fields that had only been reclaimed for a year, we spent many sleepless nights, shed a lot of sweat, and carried out the rush irrigation and sowing of wheat, determined to grow thriving crops and reap abundant harvests on the Qinghai Plateau. However, when hundreds of acres of wheat seedlings emerged, when they needed rainwater like a baby needs breast milk, the weather turned cold, and the snow water on the mountains stopped flowing. For more than twenty days, we have been walking along the dry riverbeds, climbing cliffs and walking on the goat trails trampled out by wild sheep to find water sources; in the mountain streams thousands of meters high, enduring the biting cold ice water, building stone dams to gather a few trickles of water into a canal, so that it would not seep or evaporate along the way, and letting it flow through thousands of meters of canals, drop by drop, to the wheat fields! Just as we were fighting for water, a spring rain was truly like sweet dew. Seeing the carefully cultivated wheat seedlings spread their leaves, their faces looking even greener and lovelier, how could we restrain this heartfelt joy!

Our Huaitou Kori Farm, just a year ago, wasn't it still a sparsely populated wilderness in western Qinghai where cattle and sheep grazed and weeds grew everywhere? But after we deliberately managed it, we discovered that this is a treasure land. The soil here is very fertile, and sheep manure, which is high in nitrogen content, is everywhere. The land is all black and oily. As long as we seize the five-month frost-free period and rush to sow the seeds, wheat, highland barley, potatoes, peas, rapeseed, sugar beets, and many vegetables can thrive. Before long, the concept of Qinghai as "high, cold, and barren" will be removed from people's minds. Qinghai will be built by our own hands into a beautiful frontier Jiangnan!

    高原喜雨
    贺益耕
    第一次在海拔三千公尺的青海高原上生活，才知道春雨竟迟到仲夏时节才洒向人间。在我刚离开的可爱的首都，怕已是柳绿桃红，穿着单衣还要挥汗的时候了吧？在我久别了的江南故乡，阴雨绵绵的黄梅季节怕也过去了，小麦都已开镰收割了吧？但在祖国的边陲，青海西部的高原上，我却很幸运的在红五月里，饱览了“山下雨，山上雪”的奇景。跑出室外，寒风飕飕，迎着扑面的蒙蒙细雨，我被大自然描绘出的一幅瑰丽画图迷惑住了。透过雨丝织成的轻纱帷幕，仰视环绕的群山，一夜尽皆头白，原来挺拔雄伟的群山，平添了几分妩媚，几株翠柏，兀立在顶峰上，变成了绿树银花；而在群山环抱、丘陵起伏的原野上，却东一片，西一片生长着绿油油的麦苗，透露了高原春色！
    雨点从我的双颊流到了嘴角，我兴奋地、贪婪地吮吸着这清凉的水滴，觉得它像甘露一样的芬芳甜蜜！忽然，小时候读“喜雨亭记”，“亭以雨名，志喜也”的字句涌向心头。几十年来，我是讨厌淅淅沥沥的阴雨的，今天，却被雨淋的喜滋滋的，农场内几十个同志的心情和我一样。4月中旬，我们曾经满怀喜悦，迎接开春化冻后，从高山上融化下泄的奔腾澎湃的雪水。为了让这不易驾驭的水流驯服地通过大小渠道，灌溉才开垦出来一年的田地，我们熬过了多少不眠之夜，流了多少汗水，进行着小麦的抢灌，抢播，一心要在青海高原上种出繁茂的庄稼，获得丰盛的收获；可是，当几百亩小麦嫩芽出土之后，当它像婴儿需要母乳一样需要雨水的时候，气候却变冷了，山上的雪水却流不下来了。二十多天来，我们沿着干涸的河道，攀登悬崖峭壁，在野羊踩出的羊肠小径上走着去寻找水源；在三千几百公尺高的山涧中，忍受着刺骨寒冷的冰水，垒石筑堰，把几股涓涓的细流，汇集到一个渠道里，叫它不致于在中途渗漏蒸发，让它经过几千公尺的渠道，点点滴滴地都流到麦田里去！正当我们在为争水而战的时候，一场春雨，真像甘霖。眼看着精心培育的麦苗，叶片舒展了，容颜更显的葱绿可爱了，我们怎么能抑制得住这衷心的喜悦呢！
    我们这怀头科日农场，一年前，还不是青海西部一个放牧牛羊、遍地荒草、人烟稀少的原野么？但当我们着意经营以后，就发现这是一块宝地，这里的土质很肥沃，含氮量很高的羊粪遍地皆是，土地都是黑油油的；只要抓住五个月的无霜期，抢时间撒下种籽，小麦、青稞、洋芋、莞豆、油菜、甜菜以及许多蔬菜都可以茁长。不要很久，青海“高寒荒凉”的概念将从人们印象上除掉。青海，将被我们用双手建设成美好的边陲的江南！
